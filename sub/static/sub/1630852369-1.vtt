<i>â™ª</i>

00:26.504 --> 00:27.766
- Hello?

00:27.810 --> 00:30.247
Guys? I'm back.

00:32.510 --> 00:35.035
Guys, dinner!

00:35.078 --> 00:37.472
Hi.
Why are you in dog prison?

00:37.515 --> 00:41.215
Dinner! Come down!
Grab your siblings.

00:41.258 --> 00:42.520
- Come here.
- Hi, baby.

00:42.564 --> 00:44.653
- Nick said dinner's ready.
- All right.

00:44.696 --> 00:46.263
- Georgie baby.
- No.

00:46.307 --> 00:47.525
- Give me the dog!
- No. No.

00:47.569 --> 00:48.570
- Hi.

00:48.613 --> 00:51.355
- You need a drink?
- Thank you.

00:51.399 --> 00:53.096
Love you.

00:53.140 --> 00:54.489
<i>Baby.</i>

00:54.532 --> 00:55.620
<i>Baby Georgie!</i>

00:55.664 --> 00:57.318
- Dad, Dad, Dad.

00:57.361 --> 00:58.623
Leave him alone.
- Oh.

00:58.667 --> 01:00.277
- We don't want him
to run out again.

01:00.321 --> 01:01.626
- Oh, my gosh.

01:01.670 --> 01:04.281
What has been going on
in the last five years?

01:04.325 --> 01:06.631
<i>We finished building
this dream house.</i>

01:06.675 --> 01:09.112
<i>It's 22,000 square feet.</i>

01:09.156 --> 01:11.419
And I think there's--

01:11.462 --> 01:12.681
I have no idea how many--

01:12.724 --> 01:14.291
how many rooms there are
in the house.

01:14.335 --> 01:15.640
I would have to, like...

01:15.684 --> 01:16.859
Four, five,

01:16.902 --> 01:19.166
six, seven, eight,

01:19.209 --> 01:22.430
9, 10, 11, 12.

01:22.473 --> 01:24.040
Okay, there's 13--

01:24.084 --> 01:25.781
well,
do you count ours as two?

01:25.824 --> 01:28.175
I don't think there's
an exorbitant amount of rooms.

01:28.218 --> 01:29.698
I think we have
the normal amount of rooms.

01:29.741 --> 01:30.786
They're just bigger.

01:30.829 --> 01:32.614
Except the movie theater.

01:32.657 --> 01:34.398
That's not a normal room
you have.

01:34.442 --> 01:36.618
I have so many bug bites
from Idaho.

01:36.661 --> 01:39.273
- I weirdly didn't get bit.
- What did you think of Idaho?

01:39.316 --> 01:42.189
Because dad and I were saying,
if you like it,

01:42.232 --> 01:43.581
we will build,
we'll do the whole thing.

01:43.625 --> 01:45.235
If not, maybe we should,
like, look around

01:45.279 --> 01:46.628
and see
where else we should build.

01:46.671 --> 01:48.369
- You know what conversation
this reminds me of?

01:48.412 --> 01:49.500
- What?
- The one where you were

01:49.544 --> 01:50.849
asking us about--
- Moving?

01:50.893 --> 01:51.850
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:53.200 --> 01:54.897
It's time
to build a new house.

01:54.940 --> 01:56.464
- Another house.

01:58.205 --> 01:59.249
- And Coco,
what about you?

01:59.293 --> 02:00.424
- I would spend
the summer there.

02:00.468 --> 02:01.773
- You'd spent
the whole summer there?

02:01.817 --> 02:02.992
- Mm-hmm.
- And you don't think

02:03.035 --> 02:04.515
you'd get bored?
You'd have plenty to do?

02:04.559 --> 02:05.864
- I'd probably get bored,
like, once.

02:05.908 --> 02:07.214
- Well, everyone
gets bored once.

02:07.257 --> 02:08.345
- Yeah.
- Okay, that's fair.

02:08.389 --> 02:09.825
Thank you, Nick!
- Yay.

02:12.262 --> 02:14.177
- So, you guys have
any hot plans

02:14.221 --> 02:15.874
for the rest of the summer,
till school starts?

02:17.746 --> 02:19.661
- I have...tennis.

02:19.704 --> 02:21.750
That's it.
I just have tennis.

02:21.793 --> 02:23.534
<i>- With daughters,
people will tell you</i>

02:23.578 --> 02:25.232
that they hate you
when they're 16.

02:25.275 --> 02:26.363
I would say,
that's bullsh--.

02:26.407 --> 02:28.235
They hate you
when they're 12 to 14,

02:28.278 --> 02:29.453
and then they come back.

02:29.497 --> 02:31.934
<i>Katarina is almost 15,</i>

02:31.977 --> 02:34.589
and we used to call her
"The Good One."

02:34.632 --> 02:37.244
- You just literally ripped off
all the pineapple.

02:37.287 --> 02:39.289
- So mean.
- Now we call her

02:39.333 --> 02:41.422
"The Artist Formerly Known
as the Good One."

02:41.465 --> 02:43.554
Coco, what do you want to do
the rest of the summer?

02:43.598 --> 02:45.252
- I don't know.
- Go on your phone.

02:45.295 --> 02:46.253
- Roblox?
- Really?

02:46.296 --> 02:47.645
- Yeah.
- Joking.

02:47.689 --> 02:49.430
- Not funny.

02:49.473 --> 02:52.607
- Coco is ten,
but you would think she's 21.

02:52.650 --> 02:54.913
She's
a second-degree black belt,

02:54.957 --> 02:58.395
<i>but she really is very
thoughtful, but very sharp.</i>

02:58.439 --> 03:00.615
Is she gonna, you know,
be the next president?

03:00.658 --> 03:03.879
I have no--nothing would
surprise me about Coco.

03:03.922 --> 03:05.794
- I have an internship
for the next two weeks...

03:05.837 --> 03:06.925
- Yeah.
- With Rex.

03:06.969 --> 03:08.449
I'm working
under a real estate agent.

03:08.492 --> 03:09.798
- That's very cool.
- That's the rest

03:09.841 --> 03:11.234
of my summer,
pretty much.

03:11.278 --> 03:12.801
<i>- Nicky is almost 18,</i>

03:12.844 --> 03:15.630
<i>and my gosh,
he's, like, a man.</i>

03:15.673 --> 03:17.806
You know, when your kids
go through that,

03:17.849 --> 03:21.505
you know, puberty years,
and they're kind of douchey

03:21.549 --> 03:23.290
and you gotta
get through all that,

03:23.333 --> 03:25.596
<i>what happens on the other side
of that is so cool.</i>

03:25.640 --> 03:28.512
I finally have kids that
I can hang out and talk to.

03:28.556 --> 03:30.862
- I just started
researching my essay.

03:30.906 --> 03:32.342
- Oh, for your
college application?

03:32.386 --> 03:33.952
- Oh, yeah,
I have that too.

03:33.996 --> 03:35.693
- Oh yeah, that.

03:35.737 --> 03:38.870
- Max is a very interesting,
older soul.

03:38.914 --> 03:40.829
She's very clear

03:40.872 --> 03:43.658
on who she is
and how she feels.

03:43.701 --> 03:46.487
And it's funny,
because she's kind of savage,

03:46.530 --> 03:48.315
but she's also really sweet.

03:48.358 --> 03:49.838
- Let's do it.
- Depending on my schedule.

03:49.881 --> 03:51.231
- Check your schedule, dear.

03:51.274 --> 03:52.971
- I will let you know,
get back to you.

03:53.015 --> 03:55.670
- Oh, my God.
They're turning 18.

03:55.713 --> 03:56.932
- Legal!

03:59.413 --> 04:00.892
Thank you.
- What does that mean for you?

04:00.936 --> 04:02.894
What do you want to do?
- Legal to pierce and tattoo.

04:05.897 --> 04:08.683
- What else are you
legal to--oh, vote.

04:08.726 --> 04:10.293
What else can you do at 18?

04:10.337 --> 04:12.556
- I am a legal adult.
- What?

04:12.600 --> 04:14.036
- I can hang out
with other 18-year-olds.

04:14.079 --> 04:15.951
- I don't know,
I was gonna--usually--

04:15.994 --> 04:18.345
usually people end up
not having a curfew,

04:18.388 --> 04:19.868
but we don't even
have a curfew.

04:19.911 --> 04:22.000
- No, 'cause you guys are good.
We trust you.

04:24.742 --> 04:25.700
- No, I'm not.

04:27.658 --> 04:29.530
<i>- We're eating.</i>

04:34.404 --> 04:35.840
- Okay, and now
there's a little roadwork.

04:35.884 --> 04:37.842
- Back and to the right.
- We're not gonna panic.

04:37.886 --> 04:39.453
<i>- It's so weird,
like, you driving.</i>

04:39.496 --> 04:40.715
- You know,
it's like riding a bike,

04:40.758 --> 04:42.717
but I don't want
to do that either, so.

04:42.760 --> 04:44.675
- Uh-oh!
- Gina!

04:44.719 --> 04:46.590
<i>- I'm a little bit of, like,
a nervous driver too,</i>

04:46.634 --> 04:48.026
so you have to bear with me.

04:48.070 --> 04:50.551
- Were you like that
before you lost your license?

04:50.594 --> 04:52.727
Or how long did you not drive?
- It was the not driving part.

04:52.770 --> 04:53.815
- Was it like
a year and a half?

04:53.858 --> 04:54.990
- A year--yeah,
a year and a half!

04:55.033 --> 04:55.991
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

04:56.034 --> 04:57.384
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

04:57.427 --> 04:59.995
Gina is officially back
on the road again.

05:00.038 --> 05:01.779
- Did you think DUI?

05:01.823 --> 05:04.521
- No, I thought I was
just gonna get a ticket.

05:04.565 --> 05:07.916
- Sheriffs were going out
to arrest you today.

05:07.959 --> 05:10.005
- That's so scary, though.
- Yeah.

05:10.048 --> 05:12.312
<i>- My biggest fears
when I drive</i>

05:12.355 --> 05:14.488
include hitting other things.

05:14.531 --> 05:17.578
Oh, I hate the bikers!
I hate the bikers!

05:17.621 --> 05:20.494
I feel like, as long as
I'm not hitting other things,

05:20.537 --> 05:24.628
I am, like, achieving the goal
of driving in general.

05:28.850 --> 05:30.460
<i>Coming in hot.</i>

05:30.504 --> 05:31.809
<i>- Everything's
gonna hurt tomorrow.</i>

05:31.853 --> 05:33.681
<i>- It will.
- 'Cause I'm gonna use muscles</i>

05:33.724 --> 05:35.030
that, like--
- It's gonna, like,

05:35.073 --> 05:36.771
hurt so good, though.
- It's gonna hurt so good.

05:36.814 --> 05:38.338
- I don't think
we did this correctly.

05:38.381 --> 05:39.687
- Is this the way
you're supposed to go?

05:39.730 --> 05:41.602
- This is the first part
of the workout.

05:41.645 --> 05:43.560
- You just have to get
through the bushes.

05:43.604 --> 05:45.954
<i>Gina and I are,
like, best friends.</i>

05:45.997 --> 05:48.130
I feel like the times
that we had lows,

05:48.173 --> 05:52.090
it was because our lives
in general were at a low point.

05:52.134 --> 05:54.005
- Have more confidence
about sh--!

05:54.049 --> 05:56.704
- How can I when I ----ing
call you three days in a row,

05:56.747 --> 05:57.835
and you won't even
call me back?

05:57.879 --> 05:59.446
- Whatever, Emily.
I'm pissed at you!

05:59.489 --> 06:01.622
- But now, I feel like
things are just amazing

06:01.665 --> 06:05.147
because she's happy
and healthy and glowy.

06:05.190 --> 06:07.410
- Hi!
- Hi.

06:07.454 --> 06:09.020
These look like
torture devices.

06:09.064 --> 06:10.805
<i>- They are.</i>

06:10.848 --> 06:11.936
This is Paige.
- Hi.

06:11.980 --> 06:14.069
- You're gonna hate her
by the end.

06:14.112 --> 06:15.853
- You'll love me.
- Yeah.

06:15.897 --> 06:17.638
She says that.
She has to say that, but.

06:17.681 --> 06:19.727
- All right, you guys.
We're gonna get started.

06:19.770 --> 06:22.643
Let those arms lengthen out.
Carefully step down.

06:22.686 --> 06:25.515
Elbows here.
Pausing at the bottom.

06:25.559 --> 06:29.171
- Show off those new tatas.
- Stick out the tatas.

06:29.214 --> 06:30.564
Shoulders down.

06:30.607 --> 06:33.480
I love the sweat, Gina.
- I love to sweat.

06:33.523 --> 06:35.046
- Are you supposed
to feel nauseous?

06:35.090 --> 06:36.526
- Yes.
- Totally.

06:36.570 --> 06:37.832
<i>- Do I like Pilates?</i>

06:37.875 --> 06:39.486
No.

06:39.529 --> 06:41.444
Will I do it for Gina?
Yes.

06:41.488 --> 06:43.881
- I call this one
"The Vagina Ripper."

06:43.925 --> 06:45.709
- I call it
"The Tampon Loser."

06:46.971 --> 06:49.713
<i>However, I'll stick
to my Peloton.</i>

06:49.757 --> 06:52.412
That hurts my vagina too,
though.

06:52.455 --> 06:55.023
- You hit this low plank
position, pause right here.

06:55.066 --> 06:57.068
And take it down.
-

06:57.112 --> 06:58.679
- You survived.

06:58.722 --> 07:00.028
- You're alive!
You're alive.

07:00.071 --> 07:02.422
- All right, I'm gonna
let you ride to the front.

07:02.465 --> 07:03.423
Ta-da!
- Yay!

07:03.466 --> 07:05.512
- Oh!

07:05.555 --> 07:07.644
- You want to take a minute?
- I got--oh!

07:07.688 --> 07:09.167
I got nauseous there
for a little bit.

07:09.211 --> 07:11.474
- Honestly, I like to take
a break too before I drive.

07:11.518 --> 07:12.693
- I have to ride with you.

07:12.736 --> 07:14.042
- I know!
- So, take as long as you need.

07:14.085 --> 07:15.609
- I don't want
to get the wheel shaking.

07:15.652 --> 07:16.610
- I'd like to make it home.

07:16.653 --> 07:18.481
Okay, so,
this is very exciting.

07:18.525 --> 07:21.484
Last summer, when they were
giving the bar exam again,

07:21.528 --> 07:23.878
it was during COVID, so they
lowered the passing score

07:23.921 --> 07:25.532
to, like, 1,390.

07:25.575 --> 07:27.447
And last time Shane took it,

07:27.490 --> 07:30.885
he scored higher
than 1,390,

07:30.928 --> 07:32.713
which means he passed...
- Oh, my God!

07:32.756 --> 07:36.107
- The California Bar Exam.

07:36.151 --> 07:39.676
And he's an attorney
in California.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.199
- Am I allowed
to make fun of him for that?

07:41.243 --> 07:42.505
- Oh, go ahead.
I don't know.

07:42.549 --> 07:44.464
- This is too much fun for me.

07:44.507 --> 07:47.467
Shane Simpson passed the bar

07:47.510 --> 07:50.861
because they lowered it
so that he could reach it.

07:50.905 --> 07:53.560
It's just--

07:53.603 --> 07:55.126
It's truly a gift.

07:55.170 --> 07:57.085
- How's Travis?
- Travis is Travis.

07:57.128 --> 07:58.782
Travis is doing really good,
actually, so.

07:58.826 --> 08:00.175
- Can I just tell you
how much I love him?

08:00.218 --> 08:01.916
- Sometimes I think
you like him more than me,

08:01.959 --> 08:03.178
and that makes me
a little jealous.

08:03.221 --> 08:04.701
- I mean, sometimes I do.
-

08:04.745 --> 08:06.747
He always puts the kids first,
no matter what,

08:06.790 --> 08:08.618
and that's been really helpful

08:08.662 --> 08:11.926
with turning things around
with Matt and I to co-parent.

08:11.969 --> 08:14.798
- On Saturday,
June 22nd,

08:14.842 --> 08:17.497
your ex was arrested
in Orange County

08:17.540 --> 08:19.890
on suspicion
of domestic violence.

08:19.934 --> 08:23.154
<i>Matt denies
all of these allegations.</i>

08:23.198 --> 08:25.766
- They want to know
how the victim feels,

08:25.809 --> 08:27.637
to give a statement
to the court.

08:27.681 --> 08:29.291
- Are you testifying?

08:29.334 --> 08:31.249
- It's such a weird position
to be in.

08:31.293 --> 08:34.644
<i>- They are taking
your feelings about the case</i>

08:34.688 --> 08:37.691
<i>into very,
very serious consideration.</i>

08:37.734 --> 08:40.868
- I have a really hard time
sticking up for myself.

08:40.911 --> 08:42.783
His court case
kept getting delayed

08:42.826 --> 08:44.785
and delayed and delayed
because of COVID,

08:44.828 --> 08:46.526
and as it got delayed
and delayed,

08:46.569 --> 08:49.006
our relationship kept getting
better and better and better,

08:49.050 --> 08:51.008
and then, all of a sudden,
it was like boom,

08:51.052 --> 08:53.620
time to go give
your victim impact statement.

08:53.663 --> 08:56.971
<i>June 22nd, 2019 was
the worst night of my life.</i>

08:57.014 --> 09:00.757
<i>I still get chills
thinking about how I begged,</i>

09:00.801 --> 09:04.674
<i>begged you to stop
and think about the kids.</i>

09:04.718 --> 09:07.721
<i>It's really hard
to hold him accountable</i>

09:07.764 --> 09:11.159
because it would be much easier
at this point

09:11.202 --> 09:13.291
to just drop everything.

09:13.335 --> 09:15.685
Even though, like,
I wanted to, like, call you

09:15.729 --> 09:17.121
and stay calm
or, like, bring Travis,

09:17.165 --> 09:18.645
like, it's a hard thing,

09:18.688 --> 09:22.213
'cause it's, like,
I know it hurts you guys too.

09:22.257 --> 09:23.911
I don't want you
to have to hear it

09:23.954 --> 09:25.652
and, like, you know,
I knew it would upset him.

09:25.695 --> 09:28.263
- But you know I would do it.
- I know. I know.

09:28.306 --> 09:31.092
I couldn't even
look Matt in the face.

09:31.135 --> 09:33.181
<i>I'm angry about
a lot of things.</i>

09:33.224 --> 09:34.661
<i>Honestly, like,</i>

09:34.704 --> 09:39.013
I was, like, kind of ----ed up
for a while after it,

09:39.056 --> 09:42.059
'cause it, like,
brought back a lot of sh--.

09:42.103 --> 09:45.672
Hearing him say, you know,
"Yes, I'm guilty, Your Honor,"

09:45.715 --> 09:47.674
it was like--
you know, it's just sad.

09:47.717 --> 09:49.980
I don't want
to talk about it anymore.

09:53.897 --> 09:56.030
Can I be done?
Like, I have to be done.

09:56.073 --> 09:57.597
- Okay.

10:03.298 --> 10:05.256
At the end of the day,
when my kids grow up,

10:05.300 --> 10:07.868
they'll know their mom
stood up for herself

10:07.911 --> 10:09.739
and their dad
took responsibility.

10:13.177 --> 10:14.135
<i>- Coming up...</i>

10:14.178 --> 10:15.136
- Stella or Adeline.

10:15.179 --> 10:16.616
Covers some of your body.

10:16.659 --> 10:18.705
Sweetie, it's--
- That is not short.

10:18.748 --> 10:20.010
- You guys are growing up,

10:20.054 --> 10:22.012
and it's a lot for me
to think about.

10:22.056 --> 10:23.057
- You'll be all alone.

10:23.100 --> 10:24.101
- Stella!
- Stella!

10:30.151 --> 10:37.158
<i>â™ª</i>

10:38.333 --> 10:40.814
- Got it?
- Shannon.

10:40.857 --> 10:42.076
- Hi, ladies.

10:42.119 --> 10:43.468
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:43.512 --> 10:44.992
Ooh.
- These would be so cute.

10:45.035 --> 10:46.254
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi. Good.

10:46.297 --> 10:47.647
How you guys doing?
- Good. How are you?

10:47.690 --> 10:49.649
<i>- That's our vintage section
back there.</i>

10:49.692 --> 10:51.346
<i>Those are little scarf tops.</i>

10:51.389 --> 10:56.133
- So, in Texas, do people dress
as scantily as your sisters?

10:56.177 --> 10:57.961
-
Can you tell?

10:58.005 --> 11:00.181
<i>Look at the difference
of our outfits. No.</i>

11:00.224 --> 11:02.096
- Well, that's good.
- They do not dress like that.

11:02.139 --> 11:03.401
- That's a good thing.

11:03.445 --> 11:05.055
I'm, of course, sad
about my kids growing up,

11:05.099 --> 11:06.578
because Sophie's
already in Texas

11:06.622 --> 11:08.537
and the twins only have
two years left at home,

11:08.580 --> 11:10.844
<i>but at the same time,
I'm excited to see</i>

11:10.887 --> 11:13.542
what beautiful, young women
they become.

11:13.585 --> 11:15.500
Stella or Adeline,
what about, like, this?

11:15.544 --> 11:17.241
Covers some of your body.

11:17.285 --> 11:19.243
- Ew.
-

11:19.287 --> 11:20.636
<i>- Not gonna lie,</i>

11:20.680 --> 11:24.335
not happy about not having
control for much longer.

11:24.379 --> 11:27.469
What about this, Sophie,
for a little country girl?

11:27.512 --> 11:29.079
Oh, there's no back on it.

11:29.123 --> 11:31.125
- No, I like it.
-

11:31.168 --> 11:33.693
- How would you feel
if I stayed in Texas

11:33.736 --> 11:34.911
for the rest of my life?

11:37.958 --> 11:39.568
<i>â™ª</i>

11:42.353 --> 11:45.226
- Well, you know what,
I'm gonna be honest with you.

11:46.836 --> 11:51.145
Um, I think it would depend
on where you lived in Texas.

11:51.188 --> 11:54.104
- Probably the suburbs
of Dallas.

11:54.148 --> 11:56.324
Or have a lake house
somewhere else.

11:56.367 --> 11:59.370
- Um, I worry
about, like, Zika.

11:59.414 --> 12:01.024
- I'm not gonna get
the Zika virus.

12:01.068 --> 12:02.199
- Well, how do you know?

12:02.243 --> 12:03.461
And it can affect--
- But I'm fine.

12:03.505 --> 12:05.463
- It can affect
if you're gonna have kids.

12:05.507 --> 12:07.596
- Mom, I'm gonna be able
to have kids.

12:07.639 --> 12:09.293
- I'm not afraid
of being alone,

12:09.337 --> 12:11.165
but yet,
I don't want to be alone.

12:11.208 --> 12:12.470
That's cute, Stella.

12:12.514 --> 12:14.211
- It's so dainty.

12:14.255 --> 12:16.039
<i>- I mean,
I'm happy with John.</i>

12:16.083 --> 12:18.085
<i>And we talk about our future</i>

12:18.128 --> 12:19.956
<i>and what we're gonna do
when my kids go to school.</i>

12:20.000 --> 12:22.959
We'll be both empty-nesters.
Let's see where it goes.

12:23.003 --> 12:25.483
You look very skinny, sweetie.
- Thank you.

12:25.527 --> 12:27.094
- Do you wear a bra with that?

12:27.137 --> 12:29.009
Sweeties, it's--

12:29.052 --> 12:30.706
- That is not short.
- No, it's not.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.404
- I'm watching you guys trying
clothes on that are, like,

12:33.448 --> 12:35.624
not for little girls anymore,

12:35.667 --> 12:37.974
and you're saying
you're moving to Texas.

12:38.018 --> 12:39.323
- I'll be in California.

12:39.367 --> 12:41.543
- Okay, well that's good.
I know, you guys are--

12:41.586 --> 12:43.414
- "Okay, that's good."
- You guys are growing up.

12:43.458 --> 12:46.417
It's a little--sometimes it's
a lot for me to think about.

12:46.461 --> 12:47.505
- You'll be all alone.

12:47.549 --> 12:48.506
- Stella!
- Stella!

12:48.550 --> 12:50.247
- Mom, no.
- You have Archie.

12:50.291 --> 12:51.771
- That's why I'll be staying
in California.

12:51.814 --> 12:53.555
- I have Archie.
Well, I know I have John.

12:53.598 --> 12:56.253
<i>But I'm used to all my girls.</i>

12:59.300 --> 13:03.608
<i>â™ª</i>

13:03.652 --> 13:05.262

- How are you?

13:06.742 --> 13:08.309
My gosh, it's been so long!
- So good to see you!

13:08.352 --> 13:10.180
- Hi. Good to see you too.
- It's so good to see you.

13:10.224 --> 13:11.442
How are you?

13:11.486 --> 13:12.748

13:12.792 --> 13:14.358
we have, like--
look, we have similar--

13:14.402 --> 13:15.446
- Matching.
- Matching hair.

13:15.490 --> 13:17.100
It's Terry's favorite hair
on me.

13:17.144 --> 13:18.710
- Oh, it's cute!
- Yeah. Thank you.

13:18.754 --> 13:21.061
- I love it. It's very cute.
- It's also called dirty hair.

13:21.104 --> 13:23.106
<i>- I know.</i>

13:23.150 --> 13:24.804
Whew!

13:24.847 --> 13:27.458
Oh, my God, I'm melting.
- It is so hot.

13:29.417 --> 13:30.592
<i>What grade
is Presley going to?</i>

13:30.635 --> 13:32.159
<i>- Sixth grade.</i>

13:32.202 --> 13:33.682
- Oh right, 'cause she--
I always think...

13:33.725 --> 13:35.162
- She's a year--
- That she and Coco

13:35.205 --> 13:37.120
are the same age, but
she's a year older than Coco.

13:37.164 --> 13:38.165
- A year older.
- Yeah.

13:38.208 --> 13:39.296
- They were
in that dance class.

13:39.340 --> 13:41.211
- I know.
So cute.

13:41.255 --> 13:44.040
<i>- I've known Nicole for
about, I think, eight years.</i>

13:44.084 --> 13:46.651
We--actually, we hit if off
immediately, and we've had,

13:46.695 --> 13:48.697
like, a fun friendship
over the last eight years.

13:48.740 --> 13:50.220
<i>I always loving
running into her.</i>

13:50.264 --> 13:52.048
She's literally always
in a good mood.

13:52.092 --> 13:53.397
<i>I love that kind of energy.</i>

13:53.441 --> 13:56.661
I am gonna have a party,
and I'm gonna do it

13:56.705 --> 13:57.967
at my house.
- Okay.

13:58.011 --> 14:00.752
- So I'm gonna have Nobu
come over and do...

14:00.796 --> 14:02.189
- Oh!
- The whole thing at the house.

14:02.232 --> 14:04.408
I'm going there
to plan my menu.

14:04.452 --> 14:06.236
You want to go have lunch?
- Ooh, I would love to.

14:06.280 --> 14:08.673
- Yeah? And then I just have to
figure out who's on the list.

14:08.717 --> 14:11.111
If you want to bring anyone,
I have room at my table.

14:11.154 --> 14:12.460
- Have you met Noella?
- No.

14:12.503 --> 14:14.157
- She's super fun.

14:14.201 --> 14:15.506
- Bring her to lunch
on Tuesday.

14:15.550 --> 14:16.681
- Perfect.
- It'll be fun.

14:16.725 --> 14:18.248
We'll have, like,
a little girls' lunch.

14:18.292 --> 14:19.380
- She'll be excited
to meet you.

14:19.423 --> 14:21.425
- Oh, good!
By the way, I'm melting.

14:21.469 --> 14:22.818
- I know.
- Wish I had a hat.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.646
- It's really, really hot.
- You know, it's funny,

14:24.689 --> 14:26.300
you know who has been
texting me recently?

14:26.343 --> 14:28.171
Do you know Shannon Beador?

14:28.215 --> 14:30.260
- I would say--

14:30.304 --> 14:31.827
Yes, we know each other.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.437
I don't know
if she'll remember me.

14:33.481 --> 14:34.917
Her oldest daughter...
- Yeah.

14:34.961 --> 14:37.354
- And my middle daughter
were in preschool together.

14:37.398 --> 14:38.747
- I think
I've run into Shannon

14:38.790 --> 14:41.576
maybe three times
in the last five years,

14:41.619 --> 14:43.708
<i>but I sent her a message
on Instagram</i>

14:43.752 --> 14:45.493
<i>just saying congratulations</i>

14:45.536 --> 14:47.538
<i>about the product
that she's developing.</i>

14:47.582 --> 14:49.279
<i>So, all of a sudden,
there was kind of, like,</i>

14:49.323 --> 14:50.890
I guess a re-entry point.

14:50.933 --> 14:53.283
She texted me
a couple of times last week.

14:53.327 --> 14:54.850
She mentioned, like,

14:54.894 --> 14:57.635
a lot of fun things that we had
done together in the past.

14:57.679 --> 14:59.246
But it could also be like
a childbirth,

14:59.289 --> 15:00.551
like, you know,
when you forget,

15:00.595 --> 15:03.380
like, the bad parts
and you just remember--

15:03.424 --> 15:05.600
Shannon and I were never
close, close friends.

15:05.643 --> 15:06.906
- Shannon, this is
Heather Dubrow.

15:06.949 --> 15:08.559
- Hi. How are you?
- This is Shannon Beador.

15:08.603 --> 15:10.213
- So nice to meet a neighbor.

15:10.257 --> 15:11.780
- Get together when I get back.
How about that?

15:11.823 --> 15:13.738
- Okay, absolutely. Absolutely.
- All right, good.

15:13.782 --> 15:15.349
I would love that.
- Oh, that'd be great.

15:15.392 --> 15:18.308
- I find it funny that
her maiden name is Storms,

15:18.352 --> 15:19.919
because she is a storm.

15:19.962 --> 15:22.225
We're done.
Please leave.

15:22.269 --> 15:24.706
- Terry said,
"Let's bring the Beadors down."

15:24.749 --> 15:26.621
- You shouldn't be the one
to be talking.

15:26.664 --> 15:28.405
- Excuse me, but you are wrong.
- No.

15:28.449 --> 15:30.190
- I've ----ing had it with her!

15:30.233 --> 15:32.627
You guys
will all see the truth!

15:32.670 --> 15:34.411
- Everyone's allowed
to grow up.

15:34.455 --> 15:36.326
<i>Everyone's allowed
to have a restart.</i>

15:36.370 --> 15:39.329
So, maybe--maybe--
maybe it's that time.

15:39.373 --> 15:41.723
We did have a lot
of fun together, so--

15:41.766 --> 15:43.290
- Well, good.
- Yeah.

15:43.333 --> 15:45.422
So I thought that would be fun.
Okay, so--so, all right.

15:45.466 --> 15:46.728
- So Shannon will come.
- All right.

15:46.771 --> 15:48.251
I gotta go look at my list.

15:48.295 --> 15:49.905
Ugh, I'm sweating.

15:49.949 --> 15:52.429
- Sweating. I look gross.
I'm dripping.

15:55.476 --> 15:59.523

15:59.567 --> 16:00.960

pull all the way--

16:02.613 --> 16:05.747

you did the best you could.

16:05.790 --> 16:09.403
Ooh, thank you, dahling.

Hi, Chris.

16:18.890 --> 16:20.805
Yeah, that's better. Now
we're, like, both the patients.

16:20.849 --> 16:23.156

to do your Botox for you?

16:23.199 --> 16:24.331
<i>- Absolutely not.</i>

16:24.374 --> 16:25.462

I feel like
I could probably do it.

16:26.811 --> 16:28.291
<i>- I want diplomas
on the wall,</i>

16:28.335 --> 16:29.901
<i>or you're not coming
near my face.</i>

16:29.945 --> 16:31.512
<i>- Once my hip was replaced,</i>

16:31.555 --> 16:33.731
I felt like I was
very strong physically.

16:33.775 --> 16:35.690
But in your middle age,
things start to fall

16:35.733 --> 16:37.474
and drop
and become loose.

16:37.518 --> 16:39.607
A little bit here,
a little here.

16:39.650 --> 16:42.914
So what I did was,
I wanted to remove my implants,

16:42.958 --> 16:45.917
<i>then did a fat transfer
back into my chest,</i>

16:45.961 --> 16:47.484
<i>and we did a lift.</i>

16:47.528 --> 16:50.400
<i>And I did
a mini-lower facelift.</i>

16:50.444 --> 16:52.968
Head, shoulders, knees,
and toes. It was a lot.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.013
- They're in room two.

16:54.056 --> 16:55.318
- Okay.
- Yeah.

16:55.362 --> 16:58.495
- I am just tight and happy.
I have one chin.

16:58.539 --> 17:01.498
One.

17:01.542 --> 17:02.717
- Hey, guys!
Hi!

17:02.760 --> 17:04.501
- How's it going?
- Dr. Jen!

17:04.545 --> 17:06.677
- Thanks for coming in.
Oh, my gosh!

17:06.721 --> 17:08.201
- Is this, like,
what you usually wear?

17:08.244 --> 17:09.202
- Hey!
- Oh, yeah!

17:09.245 --> 17:10.377
- Is this your doctor outfit?

17:10.420 --> 17:11.987
- This is my sexy nurse outfit.
- Oh!

17:12.031 --> 17:13.032
- Do you like it?
- All right.

17:13.075 --> 17:14.555
Yeah, I like it.
Turn me into that.

17:14.598 --> 17:16.644
- Whatever machine you used--
- Yeah.

17:16.687 --> 17:18.341
- Well, I use all the machines.

17:18.385 --> 17:19.908
Do you want to put your legs
up and your feet up?

17:19.951 --> 17:21.257
- Should we?
- Yeah.

17:21.301 --> 17:23.825
- It's nice to see you again.
- You too.

17:23.868 --> 17:26.523
I saw you at---
the last time I--wow, I sank.

17:26.567 --> 17:27.829
It was
at Braunwyn's vow renewal.

17:27.872 --> 17:30.484
- Yeah! I met your kids
and your husband.

17:30.527 --> 17:31.920
- Yeah.
I have two boys and girl.

17:31.963 --> 17:34.401
- Where? At the vow renewal?
- At the vow renewal.

17:34.444 --> 17:36.707
- Is that Chopin?
It's Chopin.

17:36.751 --> 17:37.969
<i>- Dr. Jen came up to me.</i>

17:38.013 --> 17:39.580
<i>She was super friendly.</i>

17:39.623 --> 17:41.495
<i>She told me she was a doctor.</i>

17:41.538 --> 17:43.236
She offered me--
if I wanted to come in

17:43.279 --> 17:44.541
and get some services done.

17:44.585 --> 17:46.804
This is, like, wine
and, like, cheese.

17:46.848 --> 17:48.719
So I want you to just,
like, zap it out.

17:48.763 --> 17:50.330
<i>And then,
like, life hit,</i>

17:50.373 --> 17:52.462
<i>and so, now I'm like,
a year later,</i>

17:52.506 --> 17:54.290
cashing in that credit.

17:54.334 --> 17:55.900
- Go like this.

17:55.944 --> 17:57.467
See how it's pulling up?

17:57.511 --> 18:00.253
Just a little dab will do ya.

18:00.296 --> 18:02.820
- A dab will do?

18:02.864 --> 18:05.736
I trust you, but I'm scared
that I'm gonna look weird.

18:05.780 --> 18:07.390
- This is the horizon lines.

18:07.434 --> 18:08.609
This is the tech neck.
- Mm-hmm.

18:08.652 --> 18:11.916
- We just--when I do it,
I go in the skin.

18:11.960 --> 18:13.788
- Let's get rid of it.
- Just get rid of it!

18:13.831 --> 18:15.703
- Just wipe it out.
- We can!

18:15.746 --> 18:18.401
- This is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

18:18.445 --> 18:20.316
Jen is the full package.

18:20.360 --> 18:21.752
She is educated.

18:21.796 --> 18:24.755
<i>She works full-time.
She is a mom.</i>

18:24.799 --> 18:26.714
- One, two, three, ouch.

18:29.673 --> 18:30.892
That's it.

18:30.935 --> 18:33.460
- You scared me.
- I scared you?

18:33.503 --> 18:35.418
- Yeah, I'm fine. Yeah.

18:35.462 --> 18:37.899
And she's doing it all
in stilettos.

18:37.942 --> 18:39.901
I mean,
it's impressive.

18:39.944 --> 18:41.685
That's actually--
that's so pretty.

18:41.729 --> 18:43.600
- Right?
- That looks great, Dr. Jen.

18:43.644 --> 18:46.603
I'm gonna be doing selfies
for days.

18:46.647 --> 18:47.952
- Just take your phone away
from you.

18:51.652 --> 18:54.133
- You know Meryl Streep in,
like, "Death Becomes Her,"

18:54.176 --> 18:55.830
when they drink the vial,
and they're like--

18:55.873 --> 18:57.788
Can you do that to my boobs?

18:57.832 --> 18:59.921
- Oh, it's like "Tangled."
- And they just come back up?

18:59.964 --> 19:02.532
- You're done.
Good job.

19:02.576 --> 19:04.491
- Whew! All right.

19:04.534 --> 19:06.057
New face, who dis?

19:06.101 --> 19:09.322
I'm gonna be honest right here,
we can't piss off Dr. Jen,

19:09.365 --> 19:10.888
'cause then
she's, like--like,

19:10.932 --> 19:12.542
"Oh, I know
how to fix your face, honey.

19:12.586 --> 19:14.457
Like, yeah.
You come in, yeah."

19:14.501 --> 19:16.720
I mean, we gotta watch it
with this one.

19:16.764 --> 19:19.636
<i>You just need to give me a
six-pack, and we're all good.</i>

19:19.680 --> 19:21.508
<i>- Let's go.</i>

19:21.551 --> 19:22.813
<i>- Coming up...</i>

19:22.857 --> 19:24.728
- I'm Heather.
- Lovely to meet you. Noella.

19:24.772 --> 19:26.774
- No one wants to hear about
married people's sex life.

19:26.817 --> 19:27.862
- We have a sex dungeon.

19:27.905 --> 19:29.690
You will love it.
It's very chic.

19:29.733 --> 19:30.995
- I'm not going
to your sex dungeon,

19:31.039 --> 19:33.172
but I'm happy for you
that you love it.

19:41.267 --> 19:48.230
<i>â™ª</i>

19:50.319 --> 19:51.364
- John.
- Hey, Heather.

19:51.407 --> 19:52.626
What's up?
- Hey!

19:52.669 --> 19:53.757
- Hey, how are you?
- You shaved!

19:53.801 --> 19:55.063
- Yeah, finally.
- I love it.

19:55.106 --> 19:56.064
- Hi.
- Mask off.

19:56.107 --> 19:57.413
Mustache off.
It's so good.

19:57.457 --> 19:59.067
- Haircut. I look fresh, huh?
- You look good!

19:59.110 --> 20:00.851
- It's all for you.
- Thank you.

20:00.895 --> 20:02.288
- Did you want a cocktail?
- Maybe I'll wait

20:02.331 --> 20:04.246
until my girlfriends come,
but you want to, like--

20:04.290 --> 20:05.726
- Yeah, let's do it.
- All right, cool.

20:05.769 --> 20:09.860
So, um, every time you guys
come over, it's awesome,

20:09.904 --> 20:12.123
so I don't really want
to micromanage too much of it,

20:12.167 --> 20:15.779
but thinking, like,
everyone arrives,

20:15.823 --> 20:17.738
we do cocktails sort of
in the dining room,

20:17.781 --> 20:19.087
salon sort of area.
- Right, right.

20:19.130 --> 20:20.828
We'll pass out the drinks.

20:20.871 --> 20:22.090
<i>Historically,</i>

20:22.133 --> 20:23.744
I do love a party.

20:23.787 --> 20:25.876
This is quite a setup, right?
- It's cool, right?

20:25.920 --> 20:28.183
<i>- Two. Three. Four.
Turn to the left.</i>

20:28.227 --> 20:30.229
<i>- To me,
it's a theatrical event.</i>

20:30.272 --> 20:32.318
What's the experience?
What does it look like?

20:32.361 --> 20:35.059
What does it smell like?
What does it taste like?

20:35.103 --> 20:38.672
That girl broke the bow
off my cake and ate it.

20:38.715 --> 20:40.282
- Are you ----ing kidding me?
-

20:40.326 --> 20:41.936
- A Heather Dubrow party

20:41.979 --> 20:45.983
is a complete immersion
into fabulousness.

20:46.027 --> 20:47.158
Whatever champs.

20:47.202 --> 20:48.682
You know, and I have all that.
- Yeah.

20:48.725 --> 20:50.074
- So, we're good.
- All right. Easy.

20:50.118 --> 20:52.294
- Let's hope we don't have
to break into the wall.

20:52.338 --> 20:55.254
<i>-
I thought about it last time.</i>

20:55.297 --> 20:57.386
- I have one friend
that doesn't eat meat,

20:57.430 --> 20:59.388
but I think everyone else
sort of does everything.

20:59.432 --> 21:00.998
- Okay, yeah.
And I think we'll be okay.

21:01.042 --> 21:02.435
- All right, good!
- Awesome. Very happy.

21:02.478 --> 21:03.958
- I'm excited.
- Yes.

21:04.001 --> 21:04.959
- Hi.

21:06.874 --> 21:08.223
- Hi!
- Hi!

21:08.267 --> 21:09.833
- Thanks, honey.
Thanks for everything.

21:09.877 --> 21:11.052
I'm really looking forward
to it.

21:11.095 --> 21:12.271
- Absolutely.
- It's gonna be fun.

21:12.314 --> 21:13.446
- Heather looks so cute.
- Hi!

21:13.489 --> 21:15.970
- Aw, you look adorable.
- How are you?

21:16.013 --> 21:17.972
Look at you!
My gosh!

21:18.015 --> 21:18.973
- Good to see you.
- You too!

21:19.016 --> 21:20.104
- You look adorable.
- Thanks!

21:20.148 --> 21:21.410
You look gorgeous.
Hi.

21:21.454 --> 21:22.977
- Don't want to get my makeup
all over you.

21:23.020 --> 21:24.239
- Hi.
- Or your jacket.

21:24.283 --> 21:25.719
- I'm Heather.
- Lovely to meet you.

21:25.762 --> 21:27.329
Noella.
- Very nice to meet you.

21:27.373 --> 21:29.984
<i>I think
we have a table upstairs.</i>

21:33.030 --> 21:35.337
<i>â™ª</i>

21:35.381 --> 21:37.252
Hi.
- Hi. How are you guys?

21:37.296 --> 21:38.427
Good.
- How are you?

21:38.471 --> 21:40.342
- Good.
Just heading down to The Deck?

21:40.386 --> 21:42.344
- Yeah, three of us.
- Yeah, we're gonna be three.

21:42.388 --> 21:44.694
I don't--I doubt
the third is here.

21:44.738 --> 21:46.087
But we just head down?
- Yeah, let's go.

21:46.130 --> 21:47.393
<i>- Yeah.
Just head on downstairs.</i>

21:47.436 --> 21:49.003
<i>- Okay. Thank you.
- All right. Thank you.</i>

21:50.744 --> 21:53.312
Oh, my God, I haven't been
by the beach in a while!

21:53.355 --> 21:55.444
It's so beautiful!
- Hi, you guys.

21:55.488 --> 21:57.228
Welcome. How we doing today?
Hi.

21:57.272 --> 21:58.882
- Here, these are for you guys.
- Thank you.

21:58.926 --> 22:00.536
- My name is Cassidy.
- Thank you.

22:00.580 --> 22:02.712
<i>- This table over here, they
got, like, an orange drink.</i>

22:02.756 --> 22:04.235
- It's probably our Red Tide.
- I'll do that.

22:04.279 --> 22:05.324
- You want to try that?
- Yeah.

22:05.367 --> 22:06.368
- Perfect.
And how about you?

22:06.412 --> 22:07.500
- I'll have a skinny margarita.

22:07.543 --> 22:08.805
- I'll put that in
for you guys.

22:08.849 --> 22:10.024
- Thank you.
- Of course.

22:10.067 --> 22:12.809
- There's Shannon
in her hot, white pants.

22:12.853 --> 22:14.942
- Hey.
- What does "white pants" mean?

22:14.985 --> 22:16.378
- I said hot, white pants.

22:16.422 --> 22:17.814
- Oh.
- Hi.

22:17.858 --> 22:19.947
- And I don't mean hot,
like, temperature.

22:19.990 --> 22:22.253
I mean hot, like,
you look good.

22:22.297 --> 22:24.778
- Oh, someone's had a cocktail.

22:24.821 --> 22:26.388
- Yeah,
we're having a cocktail.

22:26.432 --> 22:28.259
- You need a cocktail.
- You got to catch up.

22:30.131 --> 22:31.872
- Can I get you something
to drink?

22:31.915 --> 22:34.222
- I'll have a skinny margarita.
Do you have Casamigos?

22:34.265 --> 22:35.528
- Yeah. I got her a Casamigos.

22:35.571 --> 22:38.226
- Yeah, I'll do the reposado.

22:38.269 --> 22:39.401
- Cheers.

22:39.445 --> 22:42.099
To the new tres amigas.
- Oh, my God.

22:42.143 --> 22:45.799
I'm like...

22:45.842 --> 22:47.801
<i>- All right, so I ordered us
a bottle of champs.</i>

22:47.844 --> 22:50.064
Is that cool?
- Yes, please.

22:50.107 --> 22:51.413
- How did you two meet?

22:51.457 --> 22:53.154
- In a airport bathroom!
- In an airport bathroom!

22:53.197 --> 22:54.895
- At a private
airport bathroom--

22:54.938 --> 22:56.462
- Oh, well that makes
it slightly better, okay.

22:56.505 --> 22:58.289
- She was washing her hands
already at the sink,

22:58.333 --> 22:59.595
and we looked over,

22:59.639 --> 23:01.205
and we both had
the exact same bracelets on.

23:01.249 --> 23:03.251
- Friendship bracelets
before we even knew each other.

23:03.294 --> 23:04.992
- And then we talked out,

23:05.035 --> 23:06.297
and her husband
was standing there,

23:06.341 --> 23:08.082
and she introduced me
to her husband.

23:08.125 --> 23:09.344
This is Sweet James.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.085
- Okay.
I've seen his billboards.

23:11.128 --> 23:12.869
So your husband's an attorney.
- Yes.

23:12.913 --> 23:14.262
<i>- So, why Sweet?
Is he sweet?</i>

23:14.305 --> 23:15.568
Is that
his billboard personality,

23:15.611 --> 23:17.091
or his real personality?
- It is him.

23:17.134 --> 23:19.267
It his him, and it's
so freaking obnoxious.

23:19.310 --> 23:21.878
He's the most sweetest,
most authentic man

23:21.922 --> 23:23.532
to--like, it's not a brand.

23:23.576 --> 23:25.273
It is actually him.

23:25.316 --> 23:27.406
My husband and I
actually met online.

23:27.449 --> 23:29.973
So we were speaking
with each other for a few weeks

23:30.017 --> 23:32.454
before we actually
physically met, at the Ritz,

23:32.498 --> 23:33.977
<i>and a waitress came by</i>

23:34.021 --> 23:35.544
and wanted to know
if we wanted another round.

23:35.588 --> 23:37.241
And I'm like,
"What are you talking about?

23:37.285 --> 23:38.895
We're getting a room.
Let's go upstairs."

23:38.939 --> 23:40.114
We fooled around
and fell in love.

23:40.157 --> 23:42.203
The hard part
with being married

23:42.246 --> 23:45.511
to an attorney who puts himself
so much into his work

23:45.554 --> 23:48.122
is that he puts everything
into the work.

23:48.165 --> 23:49.471
Like, my mother actually
passed the bar

23:49.515 --> 23:50.603
when she was pregnant
with me,

23:50.646 --> 23:51.952
but she always told me, like,

23:51.995 --> 23:53.867
"Don't marry a doctor.
Don't marry an attorney.

23:53.910 --> 23:55.521
They're always married
to their pagers."

23:55.564 --> 23:57.479
- "Their pagers." I love that.
- But then, she finally said,

23:57.523 --> 23:59.438
"Listen, if you're gonna end up
with an attorney,

23:59.481 --> 24:01.178
"at least not one
of those ambulance chasers,

24:01.222 --> 24:02.310
'cause that's just the worst."

24:02.353 --> 24:03.572
- That didn't work out well
for you.

24:03.616 --> 24:05.139
- And I'm just like,
"Mom, meet James."

24:05.182 --> 24:07.271
- Or maybe it did.

24:07.315 --> 24:08.838
- Can we get three shots
of tequila?

24:08.882 --> 24:10.187
- Do you have a preference
on tequila?

24:10.231 --> 24:11.885
- Yes. Yes.
- Reposado.

24:11.928 --> 24:13.103
- Okay, she has a preference.

24:13.147 --> 24:15.976
- Don Julio 1942?
- Yeah, that's good. 1942.

24:16.019 --> 24:18.065
- Want to do that?
I'll put that in for you guys.

24:18.108 --> 24:19.501
Cheers.
- So lovely meeting you.

24:19.545 --> 24:22.330
- Cheers to Heather and Noella
finally meeting.

24:22.373 --> 24:23.331
- Yeah.
- Loving it.

24:23.374 --> 24:24.941
- And to a beautiful lunch.

24:24.985 --> 24:29.555
- Cheers to two girls
that have warmed my heart

24:29.598 --> 24:35.517
and make me realize
that you can start off rocky...

24:35.561 --> 24:37.911
Maybe you shouldn't judge,
Gina.

24:37.954 --> 24:39.390
Fun Emily has

24:39.434 --> 24:41.262
one ----ing glass of champagne
every time we're out.

24:41.305 --> 24:43.917
But you can end up
with a really...

24:43.960 --> 24:46.223
- Aww.
- Amazing friendship.

24:46.267 --> 24:48.182
I really haven't had
that much of a friendship

24:48.225 --> 24:49.662
with Gina and Emily
in the last year.

24:49.705 --> 24:51.925
- You called me,
completely lit up.

24:51.968 --> 24:53.535
- Miss Holier Than Thou.

24:53.579 --> 24:55.015
- I'm not holier than thou!
- Well--

24:55.058 --> 24:56.625
- When you drink,
and then you call,

24:56.669 --> 24:59.106
and then you say things, and
we do get concerned for you,

24:59.149 --> 25:00.890
'cause we really are, Shannon.

25:00.934 --> 25:02.675
<i>- But I went to New York
with Gina.</i>

25:02.718 --> 25:04.415
She and I were alone together,

25:04.459 --> 25:06.505
so we did spend a lot of time
talking,

25:06.548 --> 25:07.984
<i>having dinners together.</i>

25:08.028 --> 25:09.464
We kind of bonded there,

25:09.508 --> 25:12.685
so I'm looking at both of them
in a different light.

25:12.728 --> 25:15.122
- Shannon, we grew on you.
- Yeah.

25:15.165 --> 25:17.080
- Like barnacles.
- Yeah.

25:17.124 --> 25:19.213
- No, like roses.
- Aw.

25:19.256 --> 25:21.389
- Like roses.
- Oh, that was sweet, Shannon.

25:21.432 --> 25:23.434
- Do it.
Get over the edge, girl.

25:23.478 --> 25:24.566
What I do?
Just go?

25:24.610 --> 25:27.177
- Blegh!
- Ugh!

25:29.571 --> 25:31.486
- How long have you and Terry
been together?

25:31.530 --> 25:34.402
- So we just celebrated
22 years of marriage,

25:34.445 --> 25:37.187
but December will be 25 years
from our blind date.

25:37.231 --> 25:38.624
- Oh, my gosh!
- Yeah.

25:38.667 --> 25:40.713
- That's special, you know?
- That's hard!

25:40.756 --> 25:42.671
- Very lucky.
Super grateful.

25:42.715 --> 25:44.673
- And you got a cute back end.

25:44.717 --> 25:46.414
-
- You know--

25:46.457 --> 25:49.069
- That helps marriage!
I'm just saying.

25:49.112 --> 25:50.418
- Well, you know,
no one wants to hear

25:50.461 --> 25:51.593
about married people's
sex life.

25:51.637 --> 25:53.160
- We have a sex dungeon
in our house.

25:53.203 --> 25:54.683
So, yeah,
people ask about things.

25:56.119 --> 25:57.686
You will love it.
It's very chic.

25:57.730 --> 25:58.687
- "You will love it."

25:58.731 --> 26:00.254
- Heather's like,
"I'm not going."

26:00.297 --> 26:01.429
- I'm not to your sex dungeon,

26:01.472 --> 26:03.344
but I'm happy for you
that you love it.

26:05.564 --> 26:08.436
- I'm gonna introduce Gina to
my friend Heather tomorrow.

26:08.479 --> 26:10.090
- Yeah, we're gonna go
to Javier's, right?

26:10.133 --> 26:11.265
- Right.
Yeah.

26:11.308 --> 26:13.136
- Hi, Heather.
- Shannon!

26:13.180 --> 26:14.616
How are you? <i>
- I'm good.</i>

26:14.660 --> 26:16.400
<i>- I just thought I would
call you and reach out.</i>

26:16.444 --> 26:19.012
And, if you're free,
I'd love to get together

26:19.055 --> 26:20.448
and have lunch with you
Thursday?

26:20.491 --> 26:23.320
- I had a lunch plan that day
with my friend Gina.

26:23.364 --> 26:25.235
Would it be okay
if I brought her?

26:25.279 --> 26:26.628
<i>- Yeah, of course.
Totally.</i>

26:26.672 --> 26:28.238
- Okay.
She's really sweet.

26:28.282 --> 26:29.326
- So tell me about Heather.

26:29.370 --> 26:32.547
- She is flipping funny.

26:32.591 --> 26:33.679
She is fun.

26:33.722 --> 26:35.202
She's generous,
she's giving.

26:35.245 --> 26:36.595
- Is she from Orange County?

26:36.638 --> 26:38.466
- She's from New York.
She's from New York.

26:38.509 --> 26:40.773
So you guys have that
in common.

26:40.816 --> 26:42.601
<i>I'm excited to see her.</i>

26:42.644 --> 26:44.211
- Hi. Right here.
- Perfect. Thank you.

26:44.254 --> 26:46.126
- And here's your miso sauce
over here.

26:46.169 --> 26:47.301
- Thank you.

26:47.344 --> 26:48.694
- When we went on our hike,

26:48.737 --> 26:50.478
we picked the hottest day
of the year to go walking.

26:50.521 --> 26:52.654
- Oh, my gosh, it was so hot.
- I was melting.

26:52.698 --> 26:54.308
But anyways,
you had mentioned

26:54.351 --> 26:56.527
you had not spoken to Shannon
for so long.

26:56.571 --> 26:58.051
- Oh.
- And then, she had texted you.

26:58.094 --> 27:00.140
- You know, what's funny,
I called her,

27:00.183 --> 27:02.664
and we had
a really nice conversation.

27:02.708 --> 27:04.144
- Oh, good!

27:04.187 --> 27:07.147
- And she definitely hit
the nostalgia button for me,

27:07.190 --> 27:08.801
so I'm willing
to take that chance.

27:08.844 --> 27:11.151
And I don't know, we'll see.

27:11.194 --> 27:12.761
- When Heather called me
the other day,

27:12.805 --> 27:16.156
she was walking with a friend
who says that she knows me.

27:16.199 --> 27:17.331
- Uh-oh.

27:17.374 --> 27:18.811
- When I was room mom
at the preschool.

27:18.854 --> 27:20.813
- I was walking with
a girlfriend this morning.

27:20.856 --> 27:22.249
<i>She says
you guys know each other.</i>

27:22.292 --> 27:23.816
I think your kids went
to preschool together.

27:23.859 --> 27:25.426
You know Nicole James?
- Wait a minute.

27:25.469 --> 27:27.254
Is this Nicole Wiese?

27:27.297 --> 27:28.385
- That's not her maiden name

27:28.429 --> 27:30.213
from her last husband,
I don't think.

27:30.257 --> 27:32.128
- I go, oh, my god,
Nicole Wiese.

27:32.172 --> 27:34.217
- And she goes,
"No, it's Nicole James."

27:34.261 --> 27:35.784
- I think she's just been
married a whole bunch

27:35.828 --> 27:36.785
and you just don't know.

27:36.829 --> 27:38.526
- She looked like Pam Anderson.

27:38.569 --> 27:40.136
She dated Kid Rock.

27:40.180 --> 27:43.662
I lost track of time
with her after preschool.

27:43.705 --> 27:46.229
But I was good friends
with Nicole Wiese.

27:46.273 --> 27:47.491
Was.

27:47.535 --> 27:49.668
- What's your name
before James?

27:49.711 --> 27:50.712
- Wiese.

27:50.756 --> 27:52.540
- She remembers you.

27:52.583 --> 27:55.325
- It's bugging me, because
it's like, am I losing my mind?

27:55.369 --> 27:58.720
Am I getting early--like,
I worry about Alzheimer's

27:58.764 --> 28:00.504
and early onset stuff
like that.

28:00.548 --> 28:01.723
- I don't think that's it.

28:01.767 --> 28:04.552
- The reason why
it's bothering me so much

28:04.595 --> 28:07.381
<i>is because
I don't want this girl</i>

28:07.424 --> 28:09.775
to be the person
that Heather's talking about.

28:09.818 --> 28:11.385
- I want to know.

28:11.428 --> 28:13.735
- I want to know too.
- Yeah.

28:13.779 --> 28:15.128
- All right,
I gotta pee so bad.

28:15.171 --> 28:16.782
- Okay. All right, ladies.

28:16.825 --> 28:17.870
- All right.
- So much fun.

28:17.913 --> 28:19.262
- I love you guys.
- Okay, love you.

28:19.306 --> 28:20.437
- Gotta pee.
- Need my bag.

28:20.481 --> 28:22.222
- Can you stand?
- She's such a bully.

28:22.265 --> 28:23.658
- Gina, stand.
- Look at that bully.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.094
- Okay.
- Look at your butt!

28:25.138 --> 28:27.401
- Stop it! Stop it!
- In your white jeans!

28:27.444 --> 28:28.837
Look at that!
It's all--

28:28.881 --> 28:30.491
- Emily! This is a light day
for fun, Emily.

28:30.534 --> 28:31.666
- And hot! Look!

28:31.710 --> 28:33.102
- This is a light day
for fun, Emily.

28:33.146 --> 28:35.409
- Stop it.
- Look at that! Whoo!

28:35.452 --> 28:38.194
- Stop it.
- It's fine.

28:38.238 --> 28:40.806
It's so nice.
All right.

28:40.849 --> 28:43.591
I'm not ready
to go home yet.

28:43.634 --> 28:44.635
<i>Coming up...</i>

28:44.679 --> 28:45.767
- My girlfriend Nicole.

28:45.811 --> 28:48.727
By the way,
you have the right person.

28:48.770 --> 28:50.598
- You gonna tell her?
- Stop.

28:57.605 --> 29:04.394
<i>â™ª</i>

29:04.438 --> 29:06.788
- This kitchen's clean.
Thanks, man.

29:06.832 --> 29:09.530
You're like a dream come true.
Seriously.

29:09.573 --> 29:10.836
<i>Do you want to talk
about nannying?</i>

29:10.879 --> 29:12.533
- Yeah.
- Okay, cool.

29:12.576 --> 29:13.969
Doing downward dog.

29:14.013 --> 29:16.450
Okay, so basically,
I just need you

29:16.493 --> 29:18.582
to do everything
that Ryne doesn't do.

29:21.107 --> 29:23.631
<i>Ryne and I met
at a breakfast buffet.</i>

29:23.674 --> 29:25.502
<i>It was the cliche
love at first sight.</i>

29:25.546 --> 29:27.940
But it was a little tricky
because I was with somebody,

29:27.983 --> 29:29.724
and he was with somebody,

29:29.768 --> 29:31.726
and we did not
exchange phone numbers.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.510
And then a month later,
he called me.

29:33.554 --> 29:35.077
<i>I had broken up
with that somebody.</i>

29:35.121 --> 29:36.557
Hopefully,
he had broken up with--

29:36.600 --> 29:39.125
I never really asked--
with that somebody.

29:39.168 --> 29:41.780
Okay, so we know, like--

29:41.823 --> 29:43.738
oh, my gosh, look,
he's de-linting the couch.

29:43.782 --> 29:45.958
That's freaking awesome.
- Good job, Vince.

29:46.001 --> 29:47.742
<i>- Ryne and I,
we started out the gate--</i>

29:47.786 --> 29:50.223
<i>I mean, we had three babies
in 15 months.</i>

29:50.266 --> 29:51.877
<i>Vince and Cece are the twins.</i>

29:51.920 --> 29:54.009
<i>Valor is eight years old.</i>

29:54.053 --> 29:56.446
How was your sleepover?

29:56.490 --> 29:58.709
- Bye.
- Okay.

29:58.753 --> 30:03.671
How do I balance
running a business and family?

30:03.714 --> 30:05.760
Very carefully.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.240
And I don't think very well.

30:07.283 --> 30:09.155
Okay, I'm gonna change,
'cause I'm in heels.

30:09.198 --> 30:12.506
- I'm gonna go finish
de-linting the couch.

30:12.549 --> 30:13.507
- Okay.

30:13.550 --> 30:14.813
- Hey, Ry!

30:14.856 --> 30:15.857
- Hey!
- Hi!

30:15.901 --> 30:17.076
- I'm home early!
- Oh!

30:17.119 --> 30:18.512
- Oh, my God!

30:18.555 --> 30:21.210
I was born and raised
in Laguna Beach, California.

30:21.254 --> 30:23.473
<i>I'm an aesthetic
medicine physician,</i>

30:23.517 --> 30:25.084
<i>so I make people pretty
for a living.</i>

30:25.127 --> 30:26.955
<i>I also have 20 years
of education</i>

30:26.999 --> 30:29.044
<i>and ten years of experience
behind it.</i>

30:29.088 --> 30:31.917
I see a lot of people,
and I happen to know more

30:31.960 --> 30:35.137
than I probably should on the
happenings of Orange County.

30:35.181 --> 30:37.052
You're gonna have
the best-looking neck in town.

30:37.096 --> 30:38.097
- Mm-hmm.

30:38.140 --> 30:39.794
- You see a girl,
and then they say,

30:39.838 --> 30:41.796
"Oh, my boyfriend's gonna
give you a credit card,"

30:41.840 --> 30:43.276
and then you look
at the credit card,

30:43.319 --> 30:46.888
and you're like, "Oh,
that's someone else's husband.

30:46.932 --> 30:48.629
We'll keep that one on file."

30:48.672 --> 30:51.066
Ryne, don't judge me.
I might have a glass of wine.

30:52.807 --> 30:55.201
- Stop.
Stop, I "do it every night."

30:55.244 --> 30:56.898
Can you open this?
- I don't know how.

30:56.942 --> 30:58.204
- You have to--
you just, like--

30:58.247 --> 31:00.293
I just need a big, strong man
to decork it.

31:00.336 --> 31:01.816
- Vince!
- What?

31:01.860 --> 31:03.383
- Need a big, strong man.

31:03.426 --> 31:05.907
<i>- Ryne and I do have an
unconventional relationship.</i>

31:05.951 --> 31:08.257
<i>He owns a company that does
high-end vacation rentals,</i>

31:08.301 --> 31:12.218
<i>catering to a higher-end clientele.</i>

31:12.261 --> 31:13.872
Oh, my gosh!

31:13.915 --> 31:15.917
But before that,
he was full-time father.

31:15.961 --> 31:18.572
<i>And he always puts being
a father before anything else,</i>

31:18.615 --> 31:20.226
sometimes before
being a husband,

31:20.269 --> 31:23.794
which is probably
our biggest conflict.

31:23.838 --> 31:25.144
When are you leaving
for your trip?

31:25.187 --> 31:26.797
- This week.
- Well, that's good to know.

31:26.841 --> 31:27.929
- Yeah.
- So you're gonna leave me

31:27.973 --> 31:29.670
with three kids?
- Right.

31:29.713 --> 31:31.933
But you don't have
to do anything.

31:31.977 --> 31:34.805
Well, you're not normally here,
so it would--it would be fine.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.200
Unless you fire Caitlin.

31:38.244 --> 31:40.855
- I'm not gonna fire--never.

31:40.899 --> 31:42.161
I'll die without the nanny.

31:48.167 --> 31:55.174
<i>â™ª</i>

31:55.914 --> 31:57.002
Hi.

31:57.045 --> 31:59.004
- How are you?
- Right this way, please.

31:59.047 --> 32:00.657
- Thank you.
- Okay, thank you.

32:04.400 --> 32:07.055
Here we are at Javier's,
and ironically enough,

32:07.099 --> 32:10.058
<i>I was here about 12 hours ago
with Gina and Emily,</i>

32:10.102 --> 32:11.581
having even more cocktails.

32:11.625 --> 32:13.148
Hi there.
- Oh, hi!

32:13.192 --> 32:15.672
Well, hi again.
- Yeah, how are you?

32:15.716 --> 32:17.196
- I feel like
we could have slept here.

32:17.239 --> 32:20.634
- Who walked in, by a fluke?
Heather Dubrow.

32:20.677 --> 32:22.070
- I was coming home
from a lunch yesterday,

32:22.114 --> 32:23.854
and Terry was having
his office dinner here.

32:23.898 --> 32:26.292
And so, I thought, oh, I'm just
gonna stop by and just say hi.

32:26.335 --> 32:28.250
- So, we spoke to her
for a little while,

32:28.294 --> 32:30.209
and then Heather left.

32:30.252 --> 32:33.212
After that, things get
a little bit fuzzy for me.

32:33.255 --> 32:35.997
So I didn't have
a credit card with me

32:36.041 --> 32:37.781
and I was
the last man standing,

32:37.825 --> 32:39.827
so somebody paid the bill.

32:39.870 --> 32:41.089
- I paid it.
- Oh, my gosh.

32:41.133 --> 32:42.569
- I owe you.
I brought money.

32:42.612 --> 32:44.353
- Oh, it was no big deal.
It was actually very funny.

32:44.397 --> 32:45.746
- Thank you
for taking care of me.

32:45.789 --> 32:47.008
- 'Cause Terry and I
were laughing.

32:47.052 --> 32:48.749
I'm like, "I haven't
seen Shannon in so long,

32:48.792 --> 32:50.142
"and we're having
lunch here tomorrow,

32:50.185 --> 32:51.795
"and she--
and she's dining and dashing?

32:51.839 --> 32:53.145
Like, is this
the Mt. Kisco Diner?"

32:53.188 --> 32:54.755
- Oh, my God. I know.
- "Like, what is going?"

32:54.798 --> 32:56.191
We were cracking--
- The Mt. Kisco Diner!

32:56.235 --> 32:58.280
- Yeah, I'm from New York.
I grew up in Westchester.

32:58.324 --> 32:59.978
- Oh, that's where
her parents live.

33:00.021 --> 33:01.109
- Oh, my gosh.
- Yeah.

33:01.153 --> 33:04.939
- Oh, that's so nice.
Hair of the dog?

33:04.983 --> 33:07.246
- Yeah, I'm in
for hair of the dog.

33:07.289 --> 33:08.987
What is that?
- What kind of hair is that?

33:09.030 --> 33:12.033
- This is--this is a skinny
spicy with silver PatrÃ³n.

33:12.077 --> 33:14.905
- I'll do it,
but just poco spice.

33:14.949 --> 33:16.864
- Yes.
- Thank you.

33:16.907 --> 33:18.953
- I like mucho spice.
- Okay.

33:18.997 --> 33:21.086
- Well, you know what,
you guys, I'm having a party.

33:21.129 --> 33:22.217
Nobu's catering.
- Oh, wow.

33:22.261 --> 33:23.262
- And it's gonna be
at my house.

33:23.305 --> 33:24.785
- Cool.
- And I'd love

33:24.828 --> 33:26.308
for you guys to come.
- Oh, that would be great.

33:26.352 --> 33:28.397
- And bring your girlfriend
Emily that I met last night.

33:28.441 --> 33:29.790
- Okay.

33:29.833 --> 33:31.183
- I've got, like,
empty seats at my table

33:31.226 --> 33:32.967
'cause some of my girlfriends
can't come.

33:33.011 --> 33:34.099
If you have anyone
to nominate--

33:34.142 --> 33:35.317
this is like
"The Hunger Games."

33:35.361 --> 33:37.189
Do you have anyone
to nominate for tribute?

33:37.232 --> 33:38.842
- Oh, my God,
I have somebody for tribute.

33:38.886 --> 33:40.366
- You do?
- Well, I don't know.

33:40.409 --> 33:44.196
I'm just thinking,
do you know Dr. Jen Armstrong?

33:44.239 --> 33:45.458
- No.
- Not at all?

33:45.501 --> 33:47.416
- What kind of doctor?
- She has a med spa.

33:47.460 --> 33:49.288
And I'd love to bring her,
if that's okay.

33:49.331 --> 33:50.811
- All right. Good.
- Yeah.

33:50.854 --> 33:52.117
<i>I really hit it off with Jen.</i>

33:52.160 --> 33:54.684
And I like new friends,
I like smart friends.

33:54.728 --> 33:56.469
<i>Emily's a lawyer.
Jen's a doctor.</i>

33:56.512 --> 33:59.863
I mean, like, who doesn't want
to see an MD at a party

33:59.907 --> 34:01.474
just cutting loose?

34:01.517 --> 34:03.998
- And who else is coming?

34:04.042 --> 34:05.304
My girlfriend Nicole.

34:05.347 --> 34:06.914
By the way,
that is her maiden name.

34:06.957 --> 34:08.133
You have the right person.

34:09.482 --> 34:11.136
- Oh, I--
Yes.

34:19.361 --> 34:20.928
- Okay.

34:20.971 --> 34:23.365
I'll spill the tea.
I'm gonna spill the tea.

34:23.409 --> 34:25.454
It's piping hot.

34:25.498 --> 34:28.849
<i>Just last night,
Shannon told Emily and I</i>

34:28.892 --> 34:31.765
<i>that she had this secret
about Nicole,</i>

34:31.808 --> 34:35.377
that Nicole...

34:35.421 --> 34:38.728
sued Terry Dubrow.

34:38.772 --> 34:40.208
- Okay, well,
do you know

34:40.252 --> 34:44.299
that she dated Kid Rock
right after Pam Anderson?

34:44.343 --> 34:45.822
- No.
- She did!

34:45.866 --> 34:48.216
And she looked like
Pam Anderson.

34:48.260 --> 34:50.958
- I'm asking her,
"Did you date Kid Rock?"

34:51.001 --> 34:52.351
-
Is she gonna get mad?

34:54.396 --> 34:55.789
- Yes, that's the same person.

34:55.832 --> 34:58.139
It's the right--
you have the right Nicole.

34:58.183 --> 34:59.923
- This woman, Nicole,

34:59.967 --> 35:02.100
is, in fact,
the woman she thought she was.

35:02.143 --> 35:03.492
- I'll be right back.

35:03.536 --> 35:05.886
<i>- This is something
that Heather should know.</i>

35:05.929 --> 35:08.367
She should just tell her.

35:08.410 --> 35:12.849
Let's not talk about Kid Rock.
I mean, this is absurd.

35:12.893 --> 35:14.851
- She's really nice.
- She's fun.

35:17.332 --> 35:18.899
- You gonna tell her?
- Stop it.

35:18.942 --> 35:20.379
Like, I'm serious right now.

35:23.425 --> 35:24.383
Stop.

35:24.426 --> 35:25.949
- I'm just saying.

35:25.993 --> 35:27.342
- You made a promise to me
last night.

35:27.386 --> 35:28.822
- All right.

35:28.865 --> 35:33.218
- I made a pact with Gina
and Emily the night before,

35:33.261 --> 35:37.570
saying, if, for some reason,
this is the same person,

35:37.613 --> 35:40.181
we keep our mouths closed.

35:40.225 --> 35:42.923
- I don't fully understand
why Shannon is doing this,

35:42.966 --> 35:47.232
but there is something going on
that Shannon is doing,

35:47.275 --> 35:49.234
because she's Shannon.

35:49.277 --> 35:51.410
It's--it's--
- Stop.

35:51.453 --> 35:52.976
-
Okay.

35:59.287 --> 36:01.333
- It's--it's--
- Stop.

36:01.376 --> 36:02.943
-
Okay.

36:02.986 --> 36:09.993
<i>â™ª</i>

36:11.169 --> 36:12.431
- Okay, sorry.

36:15.477 --> 36:17.827
- Heather,
you're in the coast over here?

36:17.871 --> 36:18.959
- Yeah, we're right here.

36:19.002 --> 36:20.178
As a matter of fact,
you know what,

36:20.221 --> 36:21.179
if you guys want to--

36:21.222 --> 36:22.397
because the night of the party,

36:22.441 --> 36:24.051
it's gonna be crazy,
but if you want to--

36:24.094 --> 36:26.184
- I haven't seen
the final product.

36:26.227 --> 36:27.620
- We're walking.
We're walking.

36:27.663 --> 36:29.970
And we're stopping.
This is the bathroom.

36:30.013 --> 36:31.885
Towel-warming drawers go there.

36:31.928 --> 36:33.147
<i>This is my closet.
- Really?</i>

36:33.191 --> 36:35.280
<i>- This is your closet?
- Oh, my God!</i>

36:35.323 --> 36:36.672
- You want to just pop up
to my house

36:36.716 --> 36:38.283
and I'll give you a tour?
- God, I would love to.

36:38.326 --> 36:40.241
- This was so lovely.
All right, well let's do this.

36:40.285 --> 36:41.329
Let me take you guys
for a tour.

36:41.373 --> 36:42.591
- Yeah.
- It might be bedlam.

36:42.635 --> 36:44.158
I have no idea
what's going on in my house.

36:44.202 --> 36:46.334
<i>- That's okay.
That's--I'm used to that.</i>

36:49.381 --> 36:56.039
<i>â™ª</i>

36:56.083 --> 36:59.173
<i>This is ----ing amazing.
This is glorious.</i>

36:59.217 --> 37:00.479
- All right, welcome!

37:00.522 --> 37:02.263
- This is called
a porte-cochÃ¨re.

37:02.307 --> 37:05.223
- A porte-cochÃ¨re.
- Come on in.

37:05.266 --> 37:06.963
- I love your front door.
- Okay.

37:07.007 --> 37:08.878
Here we are.
Welcome.

37:10.402 --> 37:11.446
<i>- Wow.</i>

37:11.490 --> 37:13.927
<i>â™ª</i>

37:13.970 --> 37:15.233
- This is gorgeous.

37:15.276 --> 37:17.409
- This is actually
a semiprecious stone.

37:17.452 --> 37:19.237
<i>- Wow.
- Here's a little fun fact.</i>

37:19.280 --> 37:21.891
It was brought in
on the largest container

37:21.935 --> 37:23.545
ever brought
into the United States.

37:23.589 --> 37:25.373
<i>- I love this.
This is stunning.</i>

37:25.417 --> 37:29.334
<i>- All the iron, I drew,
and the moldings, everything.</i>

37:29.377 --> 37:31.292
<i>Okay, this--
all right, Shannon,</i>

37:31.336 --> 37:32.685
you may remember me
talking about this.

37:32.728 --> 37:34.164
- Of course,
the birds...the kids.

37:34.208 --> 37:35.383
- This is the etched windows.

37:35.427 --> 37:37.951
So, there's four birds,
one for each kid.

37:37.994 --> 37:39.692
<i>- Oh, cute!
- So, here's one.</i>

37:39.735 --> 37:41.215
And there's two eggs

37:41.259 --> 37:43.304
for my frozen embryos
that I still have.

37:43.348 --> 37:44.653
- Okay...

37:44.697 --> 37:47.047
The only people who I know
who do window etching

37:47.090 --> 37:49.484
are Heather Dubrow
and the church.

37:49.528 --> 37:52.444
And we know how much
----ing money they have.

37:52.487 --> 37:54.924
- This is my office.
- I like this.

37:54.968 --> 37:56.709
- And this is one
of my favorite rooms,

37:56.752 --> 37:58.450
'cause it's
my favorite bathroom.

37:58.493 --> 38:01.366
-
Oh, I love trap doors!

38:01.409 --> 38:02.628
- Because no one knows
it's here.

38:02.671 --> 38:04.412
- I love a hidden potty!

38:04.456 --> 38:06.327
<i>- This is Terry's office.</i>

38:06.371 --> 38:08.198
<i>- Do you have people here?
- No, it's for show.</i>

38:08.242 --> 38:10.505
- All right.
But he works here.

38:10.549 --> 38:12.681
- No.
- No?

38:12.725 --> 38:14.030
<i>- This is the media room.</i>

38:14.074 --> 38:16.250
<i>This is the formal bathroom.</i>

38:16.294 --> 38:18.426
<i>I had designed those sconces
for the house.</i>

38:18.470 --> 38:19.949
<i>It's like our house sconce.</i>

38:19.993 --> 38:21.647
<i>This is the butler's kitchen.</i>

38:21.690 --> 38:23.736
<i>- Everybody needs
a second kitchen.</i>

38:23.779 --> 38:25.346
- This was our guest room,

38:25.390 --> 38:27.392
and then,
when the lockdown happened,

38:27.435 --> 38:29.219
I started doing my podcast
from home.

38:29.263 --> 38:30.220
This is my office.

38:30.264 --> 38:31.613
- Oh!
- Wow.

38:31.657 --> 38:33.354
<i>- This is beautiful!
This feels like an office.</i>

38:33.398 --> 38:35.530
<i>- Did you put the light in?
- This is a good office.</i>

38:35.574 --> 38:37.663
<i>- No, no.
Look underneath.</i>

38:37.706 --> 38:40.318
<i>- Oh, wow.
- Yeah. I love it.</i>

38:40.361 --> 38:42.624
- I could have, like, really
gone to the next level with it.

38:42.668 --> 38:44.583
- Think you are on--
on another level, yes.

38:44.626 --> 38:46.411
- And if I ever
forget my name--

38:46.454 --> 38:48.282
- Yeah.
- We're gonna go downstairs.

38:48.326 --> 38:50.980
<i>- Oh, my God.
This is so cute!</i>

38:51.024 --> 38:52.373
<i>- So...
- I love it.</i>

38:52.417 --> 38:56.377
- This, I set up
like a game truck for the kids.

38:56.421 --> 38:58.510
- This house is legit!

38:58.553 --> 39:00.642
- The garage.
- It's a parking garage!

39:00.686 --> 39:02.122
<i>- This is the bar.</i>

39:03.297 --> 39:05.125
<i>This is the movie theater.</i>

39:05.168 --> 39:07.301
<i>This is the gym.</i>

39:07.345 --> 39:08.998
<i>This is the laundry room.</i>

39:09.042 --> 39:10.130
<i>â™ª</i>

39:10.173 --> 39:11.610
- And I should have
worn my Nikes.

39:13.525 --> 39:16.310
<i>Oh, my God.
Your view!</i>

39:16.354 --> 39:18.007
<i>Did you have a view like this?</i>

39:18.051 --> 39:19.444
- No.
- Oh, my God!

39:21.054 --> 39:23.143
- So, I have
refrigerated drawers.

39:23.186 --> 39:25.450
So, with the cabinets--
- Oh, these are refrigerated?

39:25.493 --> 39:27.408
I didn't even know that
was a thing. That's amazing.

39:27.452 --> 39:29.454
- I designed one cabinet
for the whole house,

39:29.497 --> 39:31.543
and then,
they brought them all,

39:31.586 --> 39:34.023
and this was,
like, a bump.

39:34.067 --> 39:37.200
And so, I was like,
that's wrong.

39:37.244 --> 39:39.202
And so, they had
to remake all the cabinets.

39:39.246 --> 39:41.074
- Wow.
- Isn't that crazy?

39:41.117 --> 39:42.336
<i>This is Chef Nick.</i>

39:42.380 --> 39:43.642
- Hi, Chef Nick.
- Ladies.

39:43.685 --> 39:45.295
- This is Gina and Shannon.
- Hi. How are you?

39:45.339 --> 39:46.340
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.473
- I bet she's a joy
to cook for.

39:48.516 --> 39:50.083
- Yeah, she is.
-

39:52.520 --> 39:54.043
<i>- Back in the day.</i>

39:54.087 --> 39:56.524
<i>- Do you miss living here?
- I'm not gonna lie.</i>

39:56.568 --> 39:58.047
<i>- I feel like
you're having a moment.</i>

39:58.091 --> 39:59.658
- I'm having--I am.
- Really? I feel something.

39:59.701 --> 40:01.442
- No, it just--it brings up
a lot of memories.

40:01.486 --> 40:02.443
- Yeah.

40:02.487 --> 40:04.402
<i>- My home was my fourth child.</i>

40:07.448 --> 40:09.494
<i>â™ª</i>

40:09.537 --> 40:13.628
But the house that David and I
built has a lot of memories,

40:13.672 --> 40:15.456
both good and bad.

40:15.500 --> 40:18.590
I'm open! I'm open!

40:18.633 --> 40:20.722
- Oh!
- Oh!

40:20.766 --> 40:22.507
Stella, go like this
to Adeline.

40:22.550 --> 40:24.639
- Go.
- Point at her.

40:24.683 --> 40:27.294
- I can't change the past
and what I did.

40:27.337 --> 40:30.079
I can only try and make
the here and now better.

40:30.123 --> 40:33.561
- The last thing in the world
we want you guys to worry about

40:33.605 --> 40:37.435
is whether we're gonna
stay together as a family.

40:37.478 --> 40:41.482
It's a part
of my family's history.

40:41.526 --> 40:44.398
And, um...

40:44.442 --> 40:46.313
all this is being triggered.

40:46.356 --> 40:47.880
I have not been
in this neighborhood once,

40:47.923 --> 40:49.490
so it's been very--
- Here, you need this.

40:49.534 --> 40:51.187
- Since you moved out?
- No.

40:51.231 --> 40:53.799
- Here. Drink this.
- Until recently.

40:53.842 --> 40:56.366
When you say--
I see the refrigerator drawers,

40:56.410 --> 40:58.847
and I see all the same things
that we had,

40:58.891 --> 41:00.370
and then,
it makes me think

41:00.414 --> 41:01.676
that that wasn't even part
of my life.

41:01.720 --> 41:02.808
It seems, like, so long ago.

41:02.851 --> 41:04.287
- Like a different lifetime.
- Yeah.

41:04.331 --> 41:05.680
- That's crazy.

41:05.724 --> 41:08.422
<i>So now, we're gonna this way.
- Oh, my God.</i>

41:08.466 --> 41:10.424
<i>- This is where
the magic happens.</i>

41:10.468 --> 41:12.252
- I feel like
your bed is small, though.

41:12.295 --> 41:13.514
- No, it's a California King.

41:13.558 --> 41:15.690
<i>But everything shrinks
in here, so--</i>

41:15.734 --> 41:17.213
<i>- Yeah.</i>

41:17.257 --> 41:19.259
<i>- A lot of furniture
had to be custom-made.</i>

41:19.302 --> 41:21.348
<i>Now I'm--take you
in the bathroom.</i>

41:21.391 --> 41:22.654
<i>- Wow.
- Oh, I love it.</i>

41:22.697 --> 41:24.133
- This is the best part
of the house.

41:24.177 --> 41:25.439
So when you come
out of the shower...

41:25.483 --> 41:27.789
- Are there hot towels
in there? Heather.

41:27.833 --> 41:29.487
- Do you want
to touch one, Gina?

41:29.530 --> 41:31.576
- I don't even know if I want
to be friends with you anymore.

41:31.619 --> 41:33.403
- You do. You want
to take a shower in my shower.

41:33.447 --> 41:34.753
- I do, and I want
to feel your hot towels.

41:34.796 --> 41:36.319
- You do.
- I do.

41:36.363 --> 41:38.452
I want to feel your hot towels.
- Come feel my hot towels.

41:38.496 --> 41:40.106
- Oh, that's nice.
It's really nice.

41:40.149 --> 41:42.282
- It's so good, and it's nice
'cause you just open the door,

41:42.325 --> 41:43.675
and then, they're right here.
- Yeah.

41:43.718 --> 41:45.328
- And they're so delicious,
aren't they?

41:45.372 --> 41:48.244
- They're amazing.
They're amazing.

41:48.288 --> 41:49.594
Is this your closet?
- This is my closet.

41:49.637 --> 41:51.378
- This is your closet.

41:51.421 --> 41:53.380
What the [BLEEP], Heather?

41:53.423 --> 41:54.773
<i>Holy sh--.</i>

41:54.816 --> 41:56.688
<i>Is this actually
how you keep your clothes?</i>

41:56.731 --> 41:58.254
<i>- She has the ladder
that does around.</i>

41:58.298 --> 41:59.342
<i>- Well, you need the ladder</i>

41:59.386 --> 42:00.866
'cause I have
to pull stuff down.

42:00.909 --> 42:02.607
- Oh, my God. That was my
dream, and I told Travis that.

42:02.650 --> 42:03.651
And I--
- Okay.

42:03.695 --> 42:05.348
- It's very Belle.
it's very Belle.

42:05.392 --> 42:07.220
<i>- What's Belle?
- "Beauty and the Beast."</i>

42:07.263 --> 42:08.569
- Well, you can have it too.
It's okay.

42:08.613 --> 42:10.223
- I--one day.
- Okay.

42:10.266 --> 42:11.920
<i>- This is inspiration.</i>

42:11.964 --> 42:13.487
Everything's so organized.

42:13.531 --> 42:15.663
<i>And there's, like,
clear windows.</i>

42:15.707 --> 42:19.624
Clearly somebody has washed
all of them on a regular basis.

42:19.667 --> 42:21.495
Yeah. This is great.

42:21.539 --> 42:23.932
<i>That's just the house.</i>

42:23.976 --> 42:26.631
<i>This is such a long tour.</i>

42:26.674 --> 42:27.719
<i>- Coming up...</i>

42:27.762 --> 42:29.372
- Hi, everybody.

42:29.416 --> 42:30.635
<i>Happy party day.</i>

42:30.678 --> 42:31.723
<i>- She called me last night.</i>

42:31.766 --> 42:33.289
<i>She kept saying,
"Emily, you need</i>

42:33.333 --> 42:35.640
<i>to find this information
about this Nicole."</i>

42:35.683 --> 42:38.381
When we get there,
if anything's going on,

42:38.425 --> 42:40.601
<i>it's going to look like it
was our fault.</i>

42:40.645 --> 42:41.733
- Hello, hello.

42:48.783 --> 42:55.790
<i>â™ª</i>

42:59.141 --> 43:01.666
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my gosh.

43:04.059 --> 43:07.106
I'm gonna open a bottle
of champagne right away.

43:07.149 --> 43:08.890
- Feed me. Feed me.
- Will you sit

43:08.934 --> 43:10.718
while I finish this board
really quick?

43:10.762 --> 43:11.937
- Love you, my dahling.

43:11.980 --> 43:13.199
- How's the baby?
- Oh, my God.

43:13.242 --> 43:15.244
Is it weird?
I'm kind of in love with him.

43:15.288 --> 43:16.637
I'm just like,
look at your face.

43:16.681 --> 43:18.204
I've got to kiss you.
- He's so cute.

43:18.247 --> 43:21.076
- I am a full-time mom
with full-time help.

43:21.120 --> 43:23.862
<i>We live with my mom.</i>

43:23.905 --> 43:25.603
- Oh, he's fast.
- He's faster than you!

43:25.646 --> 43:27.779
- I know!
- He outswam you!

43:27.822 --> 43:29.824
- Yay!

43:29.868 --> 43:32.784
- Good thing he's cute
and talented.

43:32.827 --> 43:35.221
<i>The first home that we looked
at together, in Crystal Cove,</i>

43:35.264 --> 43:36.788
<i>my husband was like,</i>

43:36.831 --> 43:38.180
"This is where
your mom's gonna stay."

43:38.224 --> 43:39.704
It wasn't even,
like, a debate.

43:39.747 --> 43:42.271
My mom's my best friend.
It's very dorky to admit that.

43:42.315 --> 43:43.664
- Where do we want to eat?
Outside?

43:43.708 --> 43:45.057
- Are you gonna need help
with this one?

43:45.100 --> 43:46.275
- It's not even--no.
- It's, like,

43:46.319 --> 43:47.755
heavier than you are.
- No! It's not.

43:47.799 --> 43:49.801
It's just a couple
little things here and there.

43:49.844 --> 43:52.542
- It's fabulous.

43:52.586 --> 43:54.849
When I first met you--
you stand out to everybody

43:54.893 --> 43:56.155
that I've ever met
in Orange County.

43:56.198 --> 43:57.983
- Aw.
- It's true, though.

43:58.026 --> 43:59.375
All the PTA mom--

43:59.419 --> 44:02.117
I call it the Lululemon,
like, ponytail brigade.

44:02.161 --> 44:05.164
It's very cookie-cutter.
It's very standard issue.

44:05.207 --> 44:07.732
When you kind of meet one,
you've met them all.

44:07.775 --> 44:10.299
Literally and figuratively,
I feel like the black sheep.

44:10.343 --> 44:11.866
<i>I was a welfare baby,</i>

44:11.910 --> 44:13.955
<i>but my mother built
a law practice in Palm Desert,</i>

44:13.999 --> 44:16.088
so I kind of got to see
both sides

44:16.131 --> 44:17.785
as a--as a child growing up.

44:17.829 --> 44:19.613
It's just
that feeling of, like,

44:19.657 --> 44:21.702
oh, I have to, like,
dumb myself down

44:21.746 --> 44:23.138
to be with these people.

44:23.182 --> 44:24.836
And, like,
the moment I met you,

44:24.879 --> 44:26.664
I could just be myself.

44:26.707 --> 44:29.057
I'm the best friend
that you could ever have.

44:29.101 --> 44:31.059
I am a bad bitch
to the freaking end.

44:31.103 --> 44:35.020
But I also have some bodies
buried of ex-friends.

44:39.372 --> 44:41.853
- You have a date night
with your handsome hubby,

44:41.896 --> 44:43.289
who I love.
- Oh, I love him.

44:43.332 --> 44:44.986
Kiss him and love him for me.
- Love Sweet James.

44:45.030 --> 44:46.684
- You have an amazing husband.

44:46.727 --> 44:48.816
Like, every successful man

44:48.860 --> 44:51.123
needs a confident,
strong woman.

44:51.166 --> 44:53.647
- Now he's a big deal,
'cause of my blowjobs.

44:53.691 --> 44:56.650
And my love, and my styling,
and my taking care of things,

44:56.694 --> 44:58.608
and my being a spendthrift,
and my being a bad bitch.

44:58.652 --> 45:00.828
- "Because of my blowjobs."
- They're phenomenal.

45:00.872 --> 45:03.135
But just saying, like--

45:03.178 --> 45:05.311
<i>I am married
to Sweet James Bergener,</i>

45:05.354 --> 45:07.008
<i>a very talented attorney.</i>

45:07.052 --> 45:10.185
<i>And listen, I like the perks
to it--the private planes,</i>

45:10.229 --> 45:12.318
<i>gorgeous vacations,
beautiful home.</i>

45:12.361 --> 45:15.843
<i>We live in three stories,
10,000 square feet,</i>

45:15.887 --> 45:18.237
<i>subterranean garage,
gym...</i>

45:18.280 --> 45:19.934
dungeon.

45:22.981 --> 45:24.330
<i>â™ª</i>

45:24.373 --> 45:26.636
<i>Couple living rooms,
play room.</i>

45:26.680 --> 45:29.074
Oh, elevator!

45:29.117 --> 45:30.597
Doesn't suck.

45:30.640 --> 45:32.642
- You need to bottle up
whatever you have,

45:32.686 --> 45:36.037
and put it in a pill,
and ----ing sell it.

45:36.081 --> 45:37.256
Sell it.
- I mean--

45:37.299 --> 45:38.953
- The confidence is real,
bitch.

45:38.997 --> 45:41.129
- I'm just saying--
- I love it.

45:44.176 --> 45:50.791
<i>â™ª</i>

45:50.835 --> 45:53.359
- Ryne, can you come
lift my dress up?

45:53.402 --> 45:55.753
Got to fit these suckers in.

45:55.796 --> 45:57.232
- Up or down?
- Up.

45:57.276 --> 45:59.147
Depending on your goals. Ah!

45:59.191 --> 46:00.670
Okay, good. Good!

46:04.936 --> 46:05.937
- Babe.

46:05.980 --> 46:08.809
- You look gorgeous.
- Thank you.

46:08.853 --> 46:11.246
Don't ruin my makeup.

46:13.292 --> 46:15.250
- No. Oh, Starchy, no.

46:15.294 --> 46:16.904
He's making mud.

46:16.948 --> 46:18.906
- Wow! Look at you!
- Oh, sorry.

46:18.950 --> 46:21.082
- You bougie.
You bougie.

46:21.126 --> 46:23.389
- What does "bougie" mean?
- Fancy.

46:23.432 --> 46:25.957
- Is that--I hear that
all the time, bougie.

46:26.000 --> 46:29.264
<i>- You're gonna be
the prettiest one there.</i>

46:32.485 --> 46:35.096
- Hi!
- Hi.

46:35.140 --> 46:37.229
- You look beautiful.
I like your red lips.

46:37.272 --> 46:39.840
- Thank you.
Shane likes them too.

46:39.884 --> 46:41.929
- Are you on your way?
- Yeah.

46:41.973 --> 46:43.235
So, how are you feeling?

46:43.278 --> 46:44.932
- Honestly, I'm happy to be,
like, dressed up,

46:44.976 --> 46:46.020
<i>like, having a good time...</i>

46:46.064 --> 46:47.413
- Yeah.
- A girls' night.

46:47.456 --> 46:49.284
But I'm, like, uncomfortable
because it's, like,

46:49.328 --> 46:50.851
one of those things
where it's like,

46:50.895 --> 46:53.158
<i>I'm stressed when Shannon's
calling us all the time</i>

46:53.201 --> 46:54.724
<i>and everything's a problem.</i>

46:54.768 --> 46:56.117
<i>- She called me last night.</i>

46:56.161 --> 46:57.771
<i>She kept saying,
"Emily, you're an attorney.</i>

46:57.815 --> 46:58.990
<i>"You need
to find this information</i>

46:59.033 --> 47:00.426
<i>about this Nicole."</i>

47:00.469 --> 47:02.123
<i>What am I supposed to do
with this information?</i>

47:02.167 --> 47:04.082
Bring it up at a dinner party? <i>
- Yeah.</i>

47:04.125 --> 47:05.474
<i>- It's typical
Shannon behavior,</i>

47:05.518 --> 47:08.347
where she likes to stir up
trouble on the down low

47:08.390 --> 47:10.915
so that not everybody
is privy to it.

47:10.958 --> 47:14.135
- Shannon said to me, "How well
do you know Elizabeth?"

47:14.179 --> 47:16.137
<i>She said,
"Not everything is adding up."</i>

47:16.181 --> 47:17.704
And I'm like,
"What does that mean?"

47:17.747 --> 47:19.358
She's like, "You'll just
do your own research."

47:19.401 --> 47:20.750
Like, she wouldn't tell me.

47:20.794 --> 47:21.926
<i>- That way,
if it comes back up,</i>

47:21.969 --> 47:23.318
she can play
the innocent victim.

47:23.362 --> 47:25.146
Like, "I don't know
what you're talking about."

47:25.190 --> 47:26.278
<i>- The whole thing
is so absurd.</i>

47:26.321 --> 47:28.236
<i>Like, I'm honestly
just so over it.</i>

47:28.280 --> 47:31.413
I just felt bad at a lunch
with Heather Dubrow,

47:31.457 --> 47:33.111
<i>getting to know Heather
for the first time.</i>

47:33.154 --> 47:34.852
<i>She's really nice.</i>

47:34.895 --> 47:37.332
And I felt like--like the stuff
that Shannon was saying,

47:37.376 --> 47:38.856
she should just tell her.

47:38.899 --> 47:40.118
<i>Just tell her.
It's not a big deal.</i>

47:40.161 --> 47:41.597
<i>Just tell her,
and let her get past it.</i>

47:41.641 --> 47:44.774
<i>- She was upset with you
because you brought it up,</i>

47:44.818 --> 47:48.169
<i>and she said that we all
agreed not to say anything.</i>

47:48.213 --> 47:50.519
- Right. I encouraged Shannon
to do the right thing

47:50.563 --> 47:52.130
when Heather
was not at the table.

47:52.173 --> 47:53.914
- Yeah, I agree.
- I've just had it with her.

47:53.958 --> 47:55.307
<i>- Well, here's the issue,
though.</i>

47:55.350 --> 47:58.092
When we get there,
if anything's going on,

47:58.136 --> 48:00.181
<i>it's going to look like
it was our fault.</i>

48:00.225 --> 48:03.097
- I don't understand
what her endgame is here.

48:03.141 --> 48:06.840
Like, I'm not gonna go out
of my way to say anything,

48:06.884 --> 48:09.495
but if you situation arises
or anything's being discussed,

48:09.538 --> 48:10.975
like, I have no problem

48:11.018 --> 48:13.238
just, like, telling Heather
what's going on.

48:45.009 --> 48:46.184
- Oh, my God, Max!

48:46.227 --> 48:48.838
- Hi, Heather.
You rang the bell.

48:48.882 --> 48:50.318
- Oh, my God.
That's so funny.

48:50.362 --> 48:51.841
I always say
it's a design flaw,

48:51.885 --> 48:53.713
'cause whenever I ring it,
no one ever brings it.

48:53.756 --> 48:54.888
- Oh, no way.
- Oh, my God.

48:54.932 --> 48:56.324
I love you so much.
- Yeah, of course.

48:56.368 --> 48:57.369
- Thanks, Max.
- Enjoy.

48:57.412 --> 48:58.805
- Perfect.
I'll see you downstairs.

48:58.848 --> 49:00.676
Hi, everybody.
- Hi. How are you?

49:00.720 --> 49:02.548
- Hi, Heather. How are you?
- Happy party day.

49:02.591 --> 49:04.332
- Happy party day. Welcome.
- Look at you.

49:04.376 --> 49:07.335
You guys know the flow
of the party pretty much?

49:07.379 --> 49:08.728
<i>Everyone's gonna arrive,</i>

49:08.771 --> 49:10.686
and we're gonna do cocktails
in the salon,

49:10.730 --> 49:12.384
not to be confused
with the sa-LON,

49:12.427 --> 49:13.863
which is the beauty salon.

49:13.907 --> 49:15.735
This is the SAL-on, which is
right outside the dining.

49:15.778 --> 49:17.563
When the sunset
is just perfect...

49:17.606 --> 49:19.608
Maybe someone wants
to bang the gong...

49:19.652 --> 49:21.828
We'll have appetizers,
lots of food...

49:21.871 --> 49:23.873
Vegan Jell-O shots, and they're
kind of like a push pop.

49:23.917 --> 49:25.527
Hi!
Hi!

49:25.571 --> 49:27.355
- You look gorgeous. Hi!

49:27.399 --> 49:28.878
Then we're gonna go
into the dining room...

49:28.922 --> 49:30.010
Miso soup...
Wagyu beef for Jen,

49:30.054 --> 49:32.230
'cause she doesn't
restricted carbs.

49:32.273 --> 49:33.796
Should I go into
what restricted carbs are?

49:33.840 --> 49:35.973
Bento boxes.
It's gonna be great.

49:37.583 --> 49:39.454
Your horse did so well!
- I know.

49:39.498 --> 49:41.021
- Wait! Give me the info.

49:41.065 --> 49:43.719
- We had three running
in one day.

49:43.763 --> 49:46.287
- Hi. I'm still in--
I know, it's a lot.

49:46.331 --> 49:48.420
- Oh, my gosh.
You look gorgeous!

49:48.463 --> 49:50.422
I love that you did!
You look beautiful!

49:50.465 --> 49:52.380
- It's fun. Thank you.
- Welcome.

49:52.424 --> 49:54.513
You might have
some familiar faces over here.

49:54.556 --> 49:56.819
- I know!
- Shannon, you know--

49:56.863 --> 49:59.039
- Hi! How are you?
- Nancy. Sarah.

49:59.083 --> 50:00.519
- How are you?
- Hi.

50:00.562 --> 50:02.347
- Hi. How are you?
Good to see you.

50:02.390 --> 50:04.479
- What are we drinking?
Anything you want.

50:04.523 --> 50:05.698
- This is tequila,

50:05.741 --> 50:07.265
sort of infused--
- Okay, that's perfect.

50:07.308 --> 50:08.788
Thank you so much.

50:08.831 --> 50:11.965
- Hello.
Hi. I'm Jenny.

50:12.009 --> 50:13.619
- Oh, hi, Jen!
- Nice to meet you!

50:13.662 --> 50:15.012
- I'm Heather.
It's so nice to meet you!

50:15.055 --> 50:16.665
- I'm gonna give you a hug.
Thank you so much

50:16.709 --> 50:17.840
for having us.
- Yeah, of course.

50:17.884 --> 50:19.016
- Hi.
- Hi, Shannon!

50:19.059 --> 50:21.061
- How are you?
- We met at the renewal.

50:21.105 --> 50:22.367
- Who had a vow renewal?

50:22.410 --> 50:24.499
- Braunwyn had a vow renewal.
- Oh.

50:24.543 --> 50:27.067
- Apparently,
I met Dr. Jen Armstrong

50:27.111 --> 50:28.808
at Braunwyn's vow renewal.

50:28.851 --> 50:29.939
What is this?

50:29.983 --> 50:31.767
- Vodka grapefruit.
- Three of those.

50:31.811 --> 50:34.074
That whole thing
about the--

50:34.118 --> 50:36.772
the whole thing
about the--the thing.

50:36.816 --> 50:39.079
To know--to know what her...

50:39.123 --> 50:40.994
<i>I don't remember
meeting her, so.</i>

50:45.477 --> 50:47.348
- Hello, hello.

50:47.392 --> 50:48.784
- Hi! Oh, my God.
- You look so beautiful!

50:48.828 --> 50:51.787
- You look so fancy.
- Hi. How are you?

50:51.831 --> 50:53.659
- You're so Audrey Hepburn.
I love it.

50:53.702 --> 50:55.008
- Thank you!
You look so gorgeous!

50:55.052 --> 50:56.357
- Thank you.
- Come in.

50:56.401 --> 50:58.316
Hi!
- How are you?

50:59.969 --> 51:01.449
- Oh, hi.
- Oh, hi.

51:01.493 --> 51:02.755
- Hi! How are you?

51:02.798 --> 51:04.974
Good to see you again.
- Good to see you too.

51:05.018 --> 51:06.628
Thank you for inviting me.
- Yes!

51:06.672 --> 51:08.413
Thank you for coming.
- I'm excited to be here.

51:08.456 --> 51:09.979
- I got to see you
for, like, three minutes...

51:10.023 --> 51:11.503
- I know.
- At Javier's the other night.

51:11.546 --> 51:13.679
- And then,
I think you paid my bill.

51:13.722 --> 51:15.637
- As a matter of fact,
Shannon already paid me back.

51:16.899 --> 51:18.814
- Hi!
- Hi! Nice to see you.

51:18.858 --> 51:20.686
- Good to see you.
- You look pretty.

51:20.729 --> 51:22.905
- How's it going?
You look good.

51:22.949 --> 51:24.472
- I think I need
a little more right here.

51:24.516 --> 51:25.473
- Yeah, we'll touch.
- Okay.

51:25.517 --> 51:26.518
- We'll touch.

51:26.561 --> 51:27.823
- Hey, Emily.

51:27.867 --> 51:29.608
- Oh, hi, Shannon.
I didn't know that was you!

51:29.651 --> 51:32.045
- You didn't recognize me
with the super long hair?

51:32.089 --> 51:33.568
- Oh, my God!

51:33.612 --> 51:35.353
- I thought fun Shannon
would come out tonight.

51:35.396 --> 51:36.615
- Oh, I love it.
It looks good.

51:36.658 --> 51:38.573
<i>- Shannon is just
not self-aware.</i>

51:38.617 --> 51:39.966
She was very eager

51:40.009 --> 51:43.665
to share her juicy gossip
about this girl, Nicole.

51:43.709 --> 51:45.667
- You look perfect.
- Oh, you're sweet.

51:45.711 --> 51:47.060
- You do. <i></i>

51:47.104 --> 51:49.845
- And the right thing to do
is to tell Heather.

51:49.889 --> 51:51.543
<i>'Cause I don't think
I'm capable</i>

51:51.586 --> 51:53.893
of pretending
that this is okay.

51:56.939 --> 52:01.030
<i>â™ª</i>

52:01.074 --> 52:03.468
- Come on.

52:03.511 --> 52:06.514
- Oh, my gosh.

52:06.558 --> 52:09.474
This is incredible.
- Beautiful.

52:09.517 --> 52:10.692
- Oh, my goodness.

52:13.739 --> 52:15.523
<i>â™ª</i>

52:15.567 --> 52:19.658
- Shannon, she said that
Nicole sued your husband.

52:19.701 --> 52:21.703
- Are you kidding me
right now, Gina?

52:21.747 --> 52:23.705
- I'm done.
- I want to talk to Heather.

52:23.749 --> 52:25.751
- You're ----ing trash.
her.

52:25.794 --> 52:27.753
- This is a disaster.
- No, no, no.

52:27.796 --> 52:29.058
- I'm so sorry.
- There's no filming.

52:29.102 --> 52:31.060
- It's over.
No. No.

52:31.104 --> 52:33.150
I'm kicking everyone out
of my house.

52:35.456 --> 52:36.805
<i>- This season</i>

52:36.849 --> 52:38.459
<i>on "The Real Housewives
of Orange County"...</i>

52:38.503 --> 52:40.505
- Oh!

52:40.548 --> 52:43.160
- Oh, my God!

52:43.203 --> 52:45.858
- You guys are so pretty.
Look at these three.

52:45.901 --> 52:47.555
- Oh, it's us!

52:47.599 --> 52:48.904
<i>- Welcome to Cabo, ladies.</i>

52:48.948 --> 52:51.080
<i>- This way, please.</i>

52:52.169 --> 52:54.910
- I still have
the six sombreros.

52:54.954 --> 52:56.564
- You look like
I gave birth to you.

52:56.608 --> 52:58.175
<i>- There's a lot of people
in Orange County</i>

52:58.218 --> 52:59.480
that look like cat Muppets,

52:59.524 --> 53:01.482
and I think some of them
have been in this chair.

53:01.526 --> 53:03.223
- Did you ever think
we'd be married 13 years?

53:03.267 --> 53:05.225
- I thought I'd be dead by now.
-

53:05.269 --> 53:06.574
- Cheers to New York.

53:06.618 --> 53:08.097
All right.
- The Big Apple, baby.

53:08.141 --> 53:12.189
- Do you get jealous of Gina's
relationship with Heather?

53:12.232 --> 53:14.191
<i>- I have my own relationship
with Heather.</i>

53:14.234 --> 53:15.583
I'm gonna call Heather.

53:15.627 --> 53:17.106
- Automatic voice message.

53:17.150 --> 53:18.891
- Oh, I think
I was just declined.

53:18.934 --> 53:21.067
- That wasn't a decline.
That was a block.

53:21.110 --> 53:24.505
- Noella is clearly
a very beautiful girl.

53:24.549 --> 53:25.898
- Are you Max?
- Yeah.

53:25.941 --> 53:26.899
- Hi, Max!

53:26.942 --> 53:28.640
I'm bisexual too! Hi!

53:28.683 --> 53:30.163
- She seems to be
an open book.

53:32.687 --> 53:36.082
- Shannon told me that the two
of you were not to be trusted.

53:36.125 --> 53:37.997
- I thought
we were friends, Shannon.

53:38.040 --> 53:39.955
- You were never my friend.

53:39.999 --> 53:41.609
Sit down. <i></i>

53:41.653 --> 53:42.610
- I am sitting.

53:42.654 --> 53:44.133
- Sit.
- Like, literally, though.

53:44.177 --> 53:46.484
- It would be really helpful
if we had some tools.

53:46.527 --> 53:47.528
- Can we not talk about this?

53:47.572 --> 53:49.791
- Get the
back over here!

53:49.835 --> 53:51.184
- I think it's fine.

53:51.228 --> 53:52.620
- I didn't want to invite you

53:52.664 --> 53:56.145
because you gave my daughter
pornography as a gift.

53:57.886 --> 53:59.279
- Have a great vacation.

53:59.323 --> 54:00.976
- Okay, we're done.

54:01.020 --> 54:03.240
- Are you eating a sandwich?
- Yeah, is that wrong?

54:03.283 --> 54:04.763
- We're detoxing.

54:04.806 --> 54:05.807
- It's turkey.
