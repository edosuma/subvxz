01:06.129 --> 01:09.966
Ladies and gentlemen,
after 10 years of research,

01:10.034 --> 01:12.570
i--i am pleased to announce
a breakthrough

01:12.637 --> 01:17.341
in computer bio-electronics.
the protein computer !

01:17.409 --> 01:19.309
audience: 
ooh ! ahh !

01:21.780 --> 01:24.849
oh, boy. you don't really
expect us to listen

01:24.916 --> 01:26.984
to this whole lecture,
do you, donatello ?

01:27.051 --> 01:28.486
will you shush ?

01:28.553 --> 01:30.354
i'll miss what
he's saying.

01:30.421 --> 01:33.891
wow ! cranio-electronic
reflex capacitors !

01:33.959 --> 01:35.860
oh, this is
fascinating.

01:35.927 --> 01:38.161
oh, this
is boring.

01:38.229 --> 01:39.162
yeah, dude.

01:39.230 --> 01:40.998
i'd rather watch
paint dry.

01:41.065 --> 01:44.835
and best of all, it can be
linked to the human mind !

01:44.903 --> 01:47.538
by simply thinking
a thought,

01:47.606 --> 01:49.406
i can control anything

01:49.474 --> 01:51.308
connected to
the protein computer.

01:51.376 --> 01:53.612
such as lights...

01:53.713 --> 01:54.745
uh, the air conditioning...

01:54.813 --> 01:56.581
electric doors...

01:56.648 --> 01:58.984
man: nobody move !

02:03.188 --> 02:05.123
uh-oh.
we've got trouble.

02:05.190 --> 02:07.492
what's the matter ?
pop quiz ?

02:07.559 --> 02:10.862
no. someone's trying to steal
the protein computer.

02:10.930 --> 02:11.863
come on !

02:17.937 --> 02:18.803
hyah !

02:18.871 --> 02:20.805
you just flunked,
buster !

02:23.809 --> 02:26.177
<i>toro ! toro !</i>

02:27.279 --> 02:28.145
aah !

02:28.213 --> 02:29.647
no bull !

02:30.716 --> 02:32.584
how about
a soda, jerk ?

02:39.993 --> 02:40.992
the protein computer !

02:41.060 --> 02:42.060
unh !

02:44.063 --> 02:45.364
hey !
let's go !

02:47.701 --> 02:49.635
michelangelo:
time to cut class, dudes !

02:51.004 --> 02:52.771
uh, call me
computer illiterate,

02:52.839 --> 02:54.373
but why would
a bunch of mobsters

02:54.440 --> 02:56.274
want to steal
a protein computer ?

02:56.342 --> 02:57.776
i don't know,

02:57.844 --> 02:59.745
but 10 to 1,
they'll try again.

02:59.813 --> 03:01.881
it's the early
warning system !

03:01.948 --> 03:05.584
the scanner is picking up
traces of transporter energy.

03:05.652 --> 03:08.054
whoa ! that could
only mean one thing !

03:08.121 --> 03:09.621
captain kirk
just beamed down ?

03:09.690 --> 03:11.857
no. dregg
is back !

03:11.925 --> 03:13.292
but we trashed
his dreggnaught

03:13.359 --> 03:15.561
and transported him
to dimension x.

03:15.628 --> 03:17.197
yeah, well,
we'll know for sure

03:17.264 --> 03:19.299
once i've pinpointed
the beamdown location.

03:19.366 --> 03:21.268
bingo ! let's go !

03:23.004 --> 03:26.640
i--i--i had my hands
on it, boss, honest !

03:26.707 --> 03:28.775
if it wasn't for
those reptiles--

03:28.843 --> 03:30.276
silence !

03:30.344 --> 03:34.280
i want the protein
computer, not excuses.

03:34.348 --> 03:38.018
no one fails
the globfather twice !

03:38.086 --> 03:40.420
but--but--but--
i--i--i--no !

03:40.487 --> 03:43.423
eww !
did you see that ?

03:43.490 --> 03:47.493
anyone else who fails me
will suffer the same fate.

03:47.562 --> 03:51.097
i was sent to this planet
to get the protein computer

03:51.165 --> 03:54.768
by someone who is willing
to pay dearly for it.

03:54.835 --> 03:55.902
help me get it,

03:55.970 --> 03:58.337
and i'll see that you get
enough alien firepower

03:58.573 --> 04:00.375
to take over
the entire city.

04:00.442 --> 04:02.977
uh, y-you're the boss,
globfather.

04:03.045 --> 04:04.712
yes, i am.

04:04.713 --> 04:07.181
now, you're gonna pay
another visit to the professor,

04:07.248 --> 04:10.084
and this time
i'm goin' with you

04:10.151 --> 04:12.352
to make sure there
are no foul-ups.

04:17.892 --> 04:20.695
the beamdown point
is inside that building.

04:20.762 --> 04:24.131
all right, guys.
stay alert.

04:28.537 --> 04:31.172
all: hyah !

04:31.240 --> 04:33.308
there's no one
here, dudes.

04:33.375 --> 04:35.343
well, yeah,
but you gotta admit

04:35.411 --> 04:37.645
that was one of the best
entrances we've ever made.

04:37.712 --> 04:40.714
you sure this is
the right place, donatello ?

04:40.950 --> 04:42.450
oh, this is it
all right.

04:42.518 --> 04:44.653
whoever beamed down
landed right here.

04:44.720 --> 04:47.089
hey, what's this ?

04:47.090 --> 04:51.359
eww. looks like some kind
of protoplasmic substance.

04:51.427 --> 04:54.630
eww. looks like somebody's
in bad need of a hanky.

04:58.935 --> 05:00.569
all: hyah !

05:00.637 --> 05:02.571
eww ! gross !

05:02.639 --> 05:06.074
uh, i think the busboy
forgot to clear this table.

05:06.142 --> 05:09.378
the globfather...

05:09.445 --> 05:12.247
aah ! it's alive !

05:12.315 --> 05:14.883
did he say
"globfather" ?

05:14.950 --> 05:17.219
yeah.
what does he mean ?

05:17.286 --> 05:18.953
well, maybe he
misses his daddy.

05:19.022 --> 05:22.057
is this globfather guy
a space alien ?

05:22.125 --> 05:24.859
yes...

05:24.927 --> 05:27.463
huxley's lab...

05:27.531 --> 05:30.733
computer... aah !

05:30.800 --> 05:33.503
i knew they'd go after
the protein computer again !

05:33.570 --> 05:34.470
let's go !

05:42.946 --> 05:44.480
uh... ronny ?

05:44.548 --> 05:45.982
sorry, dad.

05:46.050 --> 05:47.416
what are you
doing here ?

05:47.484 --> 05:49.418
i thought you were
with your mother.

05:49.486 --> 05:50.920
she's working late
at the med center.

05:50.987 --> 05:52.588
she said i could
stay with you.

05:52.656 --> 05:53.957
oh, no. it's much
too dangerous here.

05:54.024 --> 05:55.458
i'll take you home.

05:55.526 --> 05:57.393
uh, er... where
did i put my coat ?

05:59.463 --> 06:01.397
uh, this is
general patterson.

06:01.465 --> 06:03.332
uh, we're here
to check out lab security.

06:03.501 --> 06:05.167
can't let you enter
without a pass.

06:06.770 --> 06:08.539
here's our pass !

06:14.145 --> 06:15.913
wh-what was that ?

06:17.482 --> 06:18.916
they're
attacking the lab.

06:18.984 --> 06:20.818
we've got to get you
and your equipment

06:20.886 --> 06:21.852
out of here, professor.

06:21.920 --> 06:23.954
uh, yes, of course.

06:28.793 --> 06:30.461
dad, look !

06:30.528 --> 06:32.629
wh-wh-what's going on ?

06:32.697 --> 06:35.032
we're taking your
protein computer.

06:44.009 --> 06:46.910
all: turtle power !

07:00.926 --> 07:03.895
no ! you'll hurt
the protein computer brain !

07:08.434 --> 07:10.368
unh ! there's only
one thing worse

07:10.436 --> 07:12.070
than impersonating
an officer !

07:14.574 --> 07:15.740
oof !

07:15.808 --> 07:17.509
and that's
impersonating a turtle !

07:17.577 --> 07:20.512
you'll regret getting
in my way, reptile.

07:22.448 --> 07:26.851
unh ! get off of me,
you slime bucket !

07:26.919 --> 07:28.853
once i cover you
with protoplasm,

07:28.921 --> 07:30.621
you'll turn
into an ameba.

07:30.690 --> 07:34.727
just like me !
heh heh heh !

07:38.365 --> 07:41.800
i, uh, think i need
some help, guys !

07:41.868 --> 07:45.771
touch him and you'll all
become amebic blobs as well.

07:47.541 --> 07:48.874
dudes, look !

07:50.343 --> 07:51.477
help !

07:51.545 --> 07:54.012
they're nabbing the professor
and his computer !

07:56.316 --> 07:58.917
but we can't just leave
raphael like this !

07:58.985 --> 08:02.955
it's time for me
to slip away.

08:16.237 --> 08:17.437
dad.

08:25.479 --> 08:27.281
if someone doesn't
do something soon,

08:27.348 --> 08:28.581
you're gonna have
enough turtle jelly

08:28.649 --> 08:30.217
to last the rest
of your lives !

08:30.285 --> 08:32.119
don't move,
raphael !

08:37.224 --> 08:39.326
michelangelo:
whoa. smooth.

08:39.393 --> 08:40.894
they got
the professor !

08:40.962 --> 08:42.763
and the protein
computer !

08:42.831 --> 08:43.864
hey, dudes !

08:43.932 --> 08:46.333
maybe the security camera
can give us a clue !

09:00.382 --> 09:02.784
professor huxley put
the protein computer brain

09:02.852 --> 09:04.552
into his son's car !

09:10.993 --> 09:12.560
yeah, and
the kid's got it !

09:12.628 --> 09:13.661
we've got
to find him

09:13.729 --> 09:15.363
before
the globfather does.

09:20.569 --> 09:22.837
april, you there ?

09:25.174 --> 09:26.207
what's up,
donatello ?

09:26.274 --> 09:27.709
an alien and some hoods

09:27.776 --> 09:30.211
just kidnapped
professor huxley.

09:30.212 --> 09:31.045
his son ronny

09:31.113 --> 09:32.947
has the protein
computer's brain.

09:33.082 --> 09:34.482
get it to the police
and have them put out

09:34.550 --> 09:36.450
an all points bulletin
on the kid.

09:36.519 --> 09:37.919
you've got it !

09:41.725 --> 09:44.393
sergeant murray,
this is april o'neil.

09:52.101 --> 09:54.102
there's something
wrong, boss.

09:54.170 --> 09:56.171
the protein computer
isn't working.

10:00.009 --> 10:01.410
where is it ?

10:01.511 --> 10:03.945
i--i--i don't know what
you're talking about.

10:04.013 --> 10:06.114
if you don't want
to become an amoeba

10:06.182 --> 10:07.282
like that
meddling turtle,

10:07.350 --> 10:09.385
i suggest you tell me
what you did

10:09.452 --> 10:11.152
with the protein
computer brain !

10:12.655 --> 10:15.257
p-p-please ! aah !
take it off me !

10:15.324 --> 10:16.725
why should i ?

10:16.793 --> 10:18.994
it gets lonely being
the only intelligent

10:19.061 --> 10:21.930
blob of protoplasm
on this puny planet.

10:21.998 --> 10:23.999
all right !
all right !

10:24.066 --> 10:26.536
it's--it's in
my son's backpack !

10:26.604 --> 10:28.838
hidden inside his
radio controlled car !

10:28.905 --> 10:32.208
ahh, that's better.

10:32.276 --> 10:34.844
well, how are we gonna
find the kid, globfather ?

10:34.911 --> 10:36.112
we don't know
what he looks like.

10:36.180 --> 10:38.615
hey, boss !
look at this !

10:38.682 --> 10:39.949
tv: professor
alfred huxley's

10:40.017 --> 10:41.651
breakthrough
protein computer

10:41.718 --> 10:43.853
was stolen from his lab
this evening.

10:43.920 --> 10:44.687
anyone who's seen

10:44.755 --> 10:46.790
the professor's son
ronny huxley

10:46.857 --> 10:49.626
should contact
authorities immediately.

10:49.693 --> 10:53.096
if these earth beings
were any denser,

10:53.163 --> 10:54.831
they'd deliver
the boy to me.

10:54.899 --> 10:57.767
p-please ! take
this stuff off me now !

10:57.835 --> 10:59.502
i think
we'll leave it on

10:59.570 --> 11:02.204
to make sure you don't
double-cross me.

11:07.746 --> 11:11.014
but--but--but
you promised !

11:11.082 --> 11:13.950
raphael: oh, that kid
could be anywhere by now.

11:14.018 --> 11:15.686
yeah, tell me about it.

11:15.754 --> 11:18.789
it's gonna be like finding
a noodle in a haystack.

11:18.857 --> 11:20.457
you mean needle,
don't you ?

11:20.525 --> 11:21.959
well, i was trying to be

11:22.027 --> 11:24.729
just a little more
positive, dude.

11:37.809 --> 11:39.109
there he is !

12:11.743 --> 12:13.178
what do you want ?

12:13.245 --> 12:15.213
just give us
your backpack, kid,

12:15.281 --> 12:17.315
and we'll
leave you alone.

12:17.383 --> 12:20.151
michelangelo: i've got
a better deal, dude.

12:20.219 --> 12:21.652
the kid keeps
the backpack,

12:21.720 --> 12:25.090
and we leave you alone.

12:46.680 --> 12:48.314
it's the globfather.

12:48.382 --> 12:49.882
don't let him get out
of his car.

12:51.552 --> 12:53.886
this time i'll turn
those turtles

12:53.954 --> 12:55.654
into mindless slime.

13:00.694 --> 13:02.427
open the windows !

13:03.863 --> 13:06.498
he's opening
the windows.

13:07.834 --> 13:10.369
oh, we can't
get out, boss.

13:10.436 --> 13:12.271
maybe you can't.

13:24.819 --> 13:26.520
look !

13:26.588 --> 13:28.522
either someone spilled
a jell-o mold,

13:28.590 --> 13:31.758
or we're in big trouble.

13:31.826 --> 13:34.761
give me the backpack !

13:34.829 --> 13:37.030
i'll keep the jelly
green giant busy,

13:37.098 --> 13:38.898
you get out of here !

13:45.206 --> 13:46.072
hyah !

13:50.345 --> 13:54.213
eww. uh, didn't anyone
ever tell you

13:54.281 --> 13:56.616
you can be fined heavily
for making graffiti ?

14:07.329 --> 14:08.395
help !

14:12.033 --> 14:13.534
l-let me go !

14:13.602 --> 14:15.035
he's got ronny !

14:17.772 --> 14:20.241
help ! help !

14:22.677 --> 14:25.045
it's your choice,
turtles.

14:25.114 --> 14:27.415
the boy or
the backpack ?

14:34.623 --> 14:36.257
easy, kid,
you're ok.

14:36.324 --> 14:37.992
they're getting away,
dudes !

14:38.060 --> 14:39.260
we've got to get

14:39.327 --> 14:40.929
that protein
computer brain back.

14:40.997 --> 14:42.364
what about my father ?

14:42.432 --> 14:45.201
don't worry, ronny,
we'll help you find him.

14:48.471 --> 14:50.405
the computer's
working, boss.

14:50.473 --> 14:52.808
good. our alien
benefactor

14:52.876 --> 14:54.043
will be pleased.

14:54.110 --> 14:57.646
this is the globfather
calling from earth.

14:57.714 --> 14:59.347
phase one complete.

14:59.415 --> 15:01.183
well done.

15:01.250 --> 15:03.952
you shall be
rewarded handsomely.

15:04.020 --> 15:05.254
thank you, dregg.

15:05.322 --> 15:07.323
shall i commence
phase two ?

15:07.390 --> 15:08.623
yes.

15:08.691 --> 15:10.659
once you've hooked
the protein brain

15:10.727 --> 15:12.861
into the national
phone switching network,

15:13.029 --> 15:15.864
i'll be able to control
all earthly computers

15:15.932 --> 15:17.666
with my brain.

15:17.734 --> 15:21.136
including their
military defense system.

15:21.204 --> 15:25.608
i'll conquer the earth
without lifting a finger.

15:25.676 --> 15:27.677
but--but
it will be days

15:27.745 --> 15:29.713
before the dreggnaught
is completed.

15:29.780 --> 15:31.915
h-h-how will we get
to earth ?

15:31.982 --> 15:34.450
put all available
microbots to work

15:34.518 --> 15:35.919
on the vortex
transporter.

15:35.986 --> 15:39.221
we'll beam to earth
as soon as it's finished.

15:39.289 --> 15:42.091
yes, my lord.

15:47.497 --> 15:50.633
what ?! the alarm
system's been cut !

16:01.579 --> 16:04.647
hook this up to the telephone
switching computers

16:04.715 --> 16:07.050
and i might be nice
and de-slime you.

16:09.421 --> 16:11.955
the professor's
telepathic helmet

16:12.023 --> 16:14.392
will link me
to the network.

16:15.794 --> 16:20.130
ahh, incredible.
i can feel my mind

16:20.198 --> 16:21.999
connecting to
millions of computers

16:22.066 --> 16:23.467
around the world !

16:28.039 --> 16:31.108
oh, great.
my system just crashed.

16:31.175 --> 16:34.345
good thing i have a cellular
modem in my notebook computer.

16:34.412 --> 16:36.714
hmm, maybe i can find out
what went wrong.

16:36.781 --> 16:39.149
i don't believe it.
someone just tapped

16:39.217 --> 16:41.118
into all the world's
phone lines !

16:41.186 --> 16:43.387
warning, earth beings.

16:43.455 --> 16:46.590
this system
is under alien control.

16:46.657 --> 16:50.895
any tampering will result
in instant reprisal.

16:50.963 --> 16:52.531
i've got to tell
the authorities

16:52.598 --> 16:53.598
what's happening !

16:53.666 --> 16:55.734
globfather:
warning, earth beings.

16:55.802 --> 16:56.901
this system--

16:56.969 --> 16:58.403
this is crazy !

16:58.471 --> 17:00.071
sure hope the turtles
can handle this.

17:00.139 --> 17:01.573
guys, it's april.

17:01.641 --> 17:03.709
some maniac
with a green face

17:03.776 --> 17:05.143
is controlling
every phone line

17:05.211 --> 17:07.045
and computer connection
in the world !

17:07.112 --> 17:09.113
sounds like
mr. slimeball.

17:09.181 --> 17:10.315
and the only place

17:10.383 --> 17:11.983
he could connect to
all the phone lines

17:12.050 --> 17:14.252
is the national
phone switching network.

17:14.319 --> 17:16.154
well, i should be able
to link up to him

17:16.221 --> 17:17.521
with the van's
cell phone.

17:17.589 --> 17:19.490
i wouldn't do that
if i were you.

17:19.558 --> 17:21.291
hey, i know what
i'm doing, ok ?

17:21.359 --> 17:22.226
it's ringing.

17:23.729 --> 17:26.164
so, those turtles
think they can tap

17:26.232 --> 17:27.933
into this network,
do they ?

17:28.000 --> 17:29.901
well, they'll soon
regret it.

17:29.969 --> 17:30.902
huh ?

17:30.970 --> 17:33.306
you dialed
the wrong number, fool.

17:33.373 --> 17:35.774
he's got control
of our weapons !

17:37.144 --> 17:38.611
get down !

17:38.679 --> 17:40.012
whoa !

17:46.453 --> 17:48.687
he's got control
of the steering !

17:51.392 --> 17:55.261
i can't turn
the wheel !

17:55.328 --> 17:56.763
ever wonder what
a bug feels like

17:56.830 --> 17:58.765
when it slams into
the radiator of a truck ?

17:58.832 --> 17:59.999
uh-uh. why ?

18:00.066 --> 18:02.067
'cause we're about
to find out !

18:02.135 --> 18:04.069
kill the computer
system quick.

18:04.137 --> 18:06.639
ok, donatello.

18:09.409 --> 18:12.277
whoa,
that was close.

18:12.345 --> 18:14.214
how can we stop
the globfather

18:14.282 --> 18:16.650
if he can control
any computer in the world ?

18:16.717 --> 18:17.750
there's no reason

18:17.818 --> 18:19.085
why more than one person
can't control the--

18:19.153 --> 18:20.220
wait a minute.

18:20.288 --> 18:21.988
i think i just
figured it out.

18:22.056 --> 18:24.157
we've got to get
back to the lair.

18:29.297 --> 18:32.232
dregg !
everything is ready.

18:32.299 --> 18:34.534
very well.

18:34.602 --> 18:37.938
it's time to take control
of this puny planet

18:38.005 --> 18:40.874
once and for all.
what's this ?

18:40.942 --> 18:44.077
the military is trying to
regain control of the system ?

18:44.144 --> 18:45.579
i'm into
the national

18:45.646 --> 18:47.280
phone switching
network, sir.

18:47.348 --> 18:51.551
good. see if you can
block the invaders out.

18:51.619 --> 18:54.387
think again, fools.

18:54.455 --> 18:57.025
we've lost control of our
particle beam satellites.

19:02.564 --> 19:05.466
this is lord dregg.

19:05.534 --> 19:08.402
you shall be punished
for trying to resist.

19:08.470 --> 19:12.272
the nations of earth have
15 minutes to surrender.

19:12.340 --> 19:15.843
or next time i fire
your satellite cannons,

19:15.911 --> 19:19.246
your cities
will be destroyed.

19:21.149 --> 19:22.917
ok, that ought
to do it.

19:22.985 --> 19:25.319
what's it supposed
to do, anyway ?

19:25.387 --> 19:27.187
well, it should
allow me to tap

19:27.255 --> 19:28.689
into the main
phone computer,

19:28.757 --> 19:30.024
giving me
mental access

19:30.091 --> 19:31.592
so i can stop
the globfather.

19:31.660 --> 19:34.328
maybe you should
try it out first.

19:34.396 --> 19:35.696
yeah, right.

19:35.764 --> 19:38.198
if i can turn
the lights off with it,

19:38.266 --> 19:39.535
we'll know it works.

19:39.602 --> 19:41.236
close but no cigar.

19:41.303 --> 19:42.838
i can't seem
to control it.

19:42.939 --> 19:44.039
here, let me try, dude.

19:47.076 --> 19:48.710
uh, sorry.

19:48.778 --> 19:50.212
boy, i don't get it.

19:50.280 --> 19:51.680
theoretically
it should work.

19:51.747 --> 19:54.216
it will, but you've got to
reduce your optic stimuli

19:54.284 --> 19:56.118
in order to concentrate
your thoughts.

19:56.119 --> 19:57.286
here, i'll show you.

19:57.354 --> 19:58.854
wait a second.

19:58.921 --> 20:01.423
i just figured out
how to do it.

20:03.593 --> 20:05.527
all right,
way to go, dude !

20:05.595 --> 20:07.529
what am i hanging
around here for ?

20:07.597 --> 20:09.097
these guys
don't want my help.

20:09.165 --> 20:12.233
come on, we've got
to stop the globfather !

20:12.301 --> 20:13.602
hey,
where's the kid ?

20:13.670 --> 20:16.237
we'll find him later.
we gotta go.

20:17.707 --> 20:19.608
we have discussed
your terms

20:19.676 --> 20:21.409
with the leaders
of all nations

20:21.477 --> 20:23.412
and have agreed
to turn over

20:23.480 --> 20:26.282
command of the planet
to you, lord dregg.

20:26.349 --> 20:29.986
at last the earth is mine.

20:30.054 --> 20:31.288
donatello:
not today, dregg !

20:33.991 --> 20:35.725
block for me.

20:35.792 --> 20:37.193
i'm gonna rush
the computer.

20:37.261 --> 20:39.695
go, green machine !

20:42.066 --> 20:45.134
whoa, there's too many
of them to tackle.

20:45.203 --> 20:46.836
but i've got
to plug my helmet

20:46.904 --> 20:48.572
into the master computer
to get control.

20:48.639 --> 20:51.675
i'm in control, fools.

20:51.742 --> 20:53.176
and to prove it,

20:53.243 --> 20:55.211
i'm going to fire
the particle beam satellites

20:55.279 --> 20:57.847
and annihilate
a dozen cities !

21:01.319 --> 21:03.519
i've only got 60 seconds
to stop dregg

21:03.588 --> 21:05.790
before the particle cannons
are ready to fire.

21:05.857 --> 21:08.392
go out for
a pass, dude !

21:09.527 --> 21:11.662
globfather: get him !

21:11.730 --> 21:12.529
whoa !

21:14.299 --> 21:15.499
i'm in !

21:15.567 --> 21:17.701
but you won't stop
the satellite cannons

21:17.769 --> 21:19.203
while i've got control.

21:23.708 --> 21:25.643
will somebody stop
that thing ?

21:25.711 --> 21:26.777
i can't concentrate.

21:28.580 --> 21:31.048
got to shut down
the satellites.

21:33.217 --> 21:37.221
your mind isn't
strong enough, reptile.

21:39.291 --> 21:42.460
my concentration
is stronger.

21:42.527 --> 21:44.695
you can't stop me now.

21:44.762 --> 21:47.398
that's what he thinks.

21:51.270 --> 21:52.570
donatello, now !

21:57.910 --> 22:01.580
it'll take more than that
to stop me, reptiles.

22:01.647 --> 22:04.082
how about this !

22:05.518 --> 22:06.384
whoa !

22:07.920 --> 22:08.854
dad !

22:08.921 --> 22:11.189
ronny, get back !

22:15.193 --> 22:17.428
not so fast, slimeball.

22:17.496 --> 22:19.931
no !

22:22.001 --> 22:24.736
mung, beam us back
to dimension x.

22:24.804 --> 22:26.871
i'll be back, reptiles.

22:26.939 --> 22:29.841
and next time
i will not be denied.

22:32.112 --> 22:33.513
oh, dad !

22:33.580 --> 22:35.648
oh, thank you
for saving us.

22:35.716 --> 22:37.717
thank your son,
professor huxley.

22:37.784 --> 22:39.952
yeah, we couldn't have
done it without him.

22:40.020 --> 22:42.655
hey, dudes, if i had
a cool car like this,

22:42.723 --> 22:44.323
i could've
tripped up dregg.

22:46.793 --> 22:47.894
ohh !

22:47.961 --> 22:49.729
gaa-wha-aah !

22:49.796 --> 22:51.664
no doubt about it,
michelangelo,

22:51.732 --> 22:53.899
you definitely could've
tripped him up.
