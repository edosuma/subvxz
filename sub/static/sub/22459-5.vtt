09:03.407 --> 09:06.638
<i>Look at me doling out the champersl</i>
<i>I'm the greatest man who ever lived.</i>

09:06.687 --> 09:10.282
Goodwill to all men!
<i>Did I just say "goodwill to all men"?</i>

09:10.327 --> 09:12.158
- Hey, man. Look at us!
- I know!

09:12.207 --> 09:14.357
- I'm having a good time!
- So am I!

09:14.407 --> 09:16.682
I mean, not, actually, but it's like I am!

09:16.727 --> 09:19.036
Only negative is no Dobby.

09:19.087 --> 09:21.840
If it peaks before Dobby gets here,
I've wasted a good party.

09:21.887 --> 09:23.878
Give her a bell?
Let her get some flavour?

09:23.927 --> 09:28.603
What, like start a message then be like,
"Stop it, Julio - grab your own cocaine.

09:28.647 --> 09:30.160
"I've got too much tit in my mouth"?

09:30.207 --> 09:34.485
Exactly. Gosh, everyone's going mad
for the lasagne. Who knew?

09:34.527 --> 09:35.880
Your mates are loving the tuna!

09:35.927 --> 09:37.599
Yeah. They're not my mates.

09:37.647 --> 09:39.763
Gatecrashers?

09:39.807 --> 09:42.879
What, they're just some men
who forced their way in here

09:42.927 --> 09:44.645
and are eating my lasagne?

09:44.687 --> 09:46.086
Dude, it just means we're a hit.

09:46.127 --> 09:47.560
Jeremy, they weren't invited.

09:47.607 --> 09:50.485
If there was no-one here but us
and them, it would be a police matter.

09:50.527 --> 09:53.758
<i>Course he doesn't care. He didn't</i>
<i>spend hours reducing the passata.</i>

09:53.807 --> 09:56.605
- Mmm. You got any more, mate?
- It's finished.

09:56.647 --> 10:00.401
And, er, listen, "mate",
who invited you to this party?

10:00.447 --> 10:03.564
- Er... Mike?
- Right, Mike.

10:03.607 --> 10:07.998
And which bottle did you bring?
Can you please identify your bottle?

10:08.047 --> 10:09.924
Look, mate,
we're not gonna be any trouble.

10:09.967 --> 10:11.446
Look, you've got to go.

10:11.487 --> 10:14.877
You can't just walk in here
and eat my food and drink my booze

10:14.927 --> 10:16.360
and try and have sex with my women!

10:16.407 --> 10:17.806
<i>My women?</i>

10:17.847 --> 10:19.644
Look, we'll be good boys - promise.

10:19.687 --> 10:24.044
Excuse me, everyone.
I'd like to make an announcement.

10:24.087 --> 10:27.318
These two gentlemen are party crashers.

10:27.367 --> 10:31.121
So I'd be very grateful if none of you
spoke to them for the rest of the evening.

10:31.167 --> 10:35.001
There is an exclusion zone
around them, a cordon sanitaire.

10:35.047 --> 10:36.605
Thank you.

10:38.207 --> 10:39.720
JEREMY: <i>Look at him.</i>

10:39.767 --> 10:42.964

10:47.127 --> 10:49.687
- Excuse me, I need to get past.
- <i>OK, take this, Elena.</i>

10:49.727 --> 10:52.366
- Could we have a quick chat?
- What about?

10:52.407 --> 10:56.639
I just wanted to say I'm sorry
about the way I behaved.

10:56.687 --> 10:58.723
It was basically because I...

10:58.767 --> 11:01.042
I couldn't handle
the strength of my feelings.

11:01.087 --> 11:02.725
Pull the other one, Jeremy.
It's got bells on.

11:02.767 --> 11:05.406
Seriously... Sarah.
<i>It is Sarah, isn't it?</i>

11:05.447 --> 11:07.642
I think you're incredible.

11:07.687 --> 11:09.439
- Sure.
- You're just a very... alive,

11:09.487 --> 11:14.959
very... incredible,
very... sexual being.

11:15.007 --> 11:18.124
Yeah, well... don't touch
what you can't afford, Jeremy.

11:18.167 --> 11:20.123
<i>30-all in flirt tennis.</i>

11:20.167 --> 11:23.876
Mark, there's something wrong in the loo.

11:23.927 --> 11:27.806
<i>God, she looks like</i>
<i>she's witnessed a war crime.</i>

11:27.847 --> 11:30.077
Oh... Ooh...

11:30.127 --> 11:32.561
Looks like somebody's
taken out puke point HQ.

11:32.607 --> 11:34.802
Oh, the humanity.

11:34.847 --> 11:37.441
Well, it must have been
one of your friends - you deal with it.

11:37.487 --> 11:39.318
What, because your friends don't poo(?)

11:39.367 --> 11:42.803
Not at parties. Who comes to a party
and does a massive poo?

11:42.847 --> 11:44.246
Sort it out, Jeremy.

11:44.287 --> 11:47.438
MARK: <i>He must be here, the culprit.</i>

11:47.487 --> 11:49.682
<i>If I give everyone my best</i>
<i>Paddington stare,</i>

11:49.727 --> 11:53.606

11:53.647 --> 11:54.966
<i>Could be him.</i>

11:55.007 --> 11:58.886
<i>He's looking pretty relaxed.</i>
<i>Dumped a heavy load, have you, sir,</i>

11:58.927 --> 12:00.599
<i>on my time?</i>

12:02.247 --> 12:06.160
<i>Look at that.</i>
<i>The Devil and Eve. And a serpent.</i>

12:06.207 --> 12:09.040
<i>If there was an apple,</i>
<i>this would be a whole famous... thing.</i>

12:09.087 --> 12:11.681
I wanted a pet with a bit of edge,
you know?

12:11.727 --> 12:13.126
Something to keep me on me toes.

12:13.167 --> 12:16.477
Every day down at my flat now,
it's me and him, survival of the fittest.

12:16.527 --> 12:18.961
I didn't want to go the full puma.

12:19.007 --> 12:21.965
I thought about a tarantula,
but where are the good times, eh?

12:22.007 --> 12:24.396
With a snake, you've got a friend.

12:24.447 --> 12:27.280
A dangerous friend.
You can touch him, if you like.

12:27.327 --> 12:28.646
I don't know.

12:28.687 --> 12:29.881
Go on. Stroke him.

12:29.927 --> 12:31.076
Stroke my snake.

12:31.127 --> 12:33.516
<i>That's it. That's just fucking it.</i>

12:33.567 --> 12:35.558
- All right, Jez?
- Yeah, um, just an idea,

12:35.607 --> 12:37.563
but would it be OK, mate,
if you fucked off

12:37.607 --> 12:39.359
before I ram a wine bottle up your cock?

12:39.407 --> 12:43.639
All right, mate. Chill out. It's only
a phallic symbol. It's not me actual dong.

12:43.687 --> 12:47.362
It's all right, Hans. I just think
me and Jez need to talk.

12:47.407 --> 12:49.875
<i>This is it. I've got to say it.</i>

12:49.927 --> 12:52.999
Look, I just, fucking... love you.

12:53.047 --> 12:55.925
I love you and I don't wanna
play it cool any more

12:55.967 --> 12:59.960
because I would eat my own fingers
just to look at your face.

13:00.007 --> 13:03.920
I will be your dog or your human
mannequin. I'll do anything you say.

13:03.967 --> 13:06.640
I just... want you.

13:12.007 --> 13:13.918
You'd be a human mannequin for me?

13:13.967 --> 13:17.004
Well, yeah. I mean, I don't know
what that involves exactly, but...

13:17.047 --> 13:18.400
I just thought you'd gone off me.

13:18.447 --> 13:21.359
I was trying to play stupid games,
but I can't...

13:21.407 --> 13:24.922
I just want to fuck
your brain into my brain!

13:24.967 --> 13:27.720
<i>Oh, wowl I've pulledl</i>
<i>I've pulled my own girlfriend.</i>

13:28.487 --> 13:31.843
MARK: <i>Great(l) My party</i>
<i>and I'm the Miss Marple of big jobs.</i>

13:31.887 --> 13:34.037
Can I ask you an additional question?

13:34.087 --> 13:35.918
Have you made use of the facilities?

13:35.967 --> 13:39.164
- I'm sorry?
- You had an appetite for lasagne tonight.

13:39.207 --> 13:40.959
But did you have another appetite?

13:41.007 --> 13:44.716
An overwhelming appetite
for faecal discharge?

13:44.767 --> 13:47.122
I used the bog, mate,
but it was flowing clean as a whistle.

13:47.167 --> 13:48.998
It was after her that the problem started.

13:49.047 --> 13:54.041
<i>Oh, my God. Could it have been? She</i>
<i>was the last one to see the victim alive.</i>

13:54.087 --> 13:56.203
<i>Jesusl It's the crime of the centuryl</i>

13:56.247 --> 13:58.158
<i>I've cracked the Da Vinci Codel</i>

13:58.207 --> 13:59.686
<i>And it's horriblel</i>

13:59.727 --> 14:04.403
Wow! If sex was an Olympic event,
we'd win gold.

14:04.447 --> 14:06.199
You're so cute, Jeremy.

14:06.247 --> 14:09.239
Sex is never going to be
in the Olympics, because of China.

14:09.287 --> 14:10.686
China wouldn't allow it.

14:10.727 --> 14:13.719
- (PHONE BEEPS)
- Gail.

14:13.767 --> 14:16.645
<i>Oh, the cock clamp.</i>
<i>The Inevitable Hulk.</i>

14:16.687 --> 14:18.803
She's finished. She'll be here soon.

14:18.847 --> 14:21.520
We'd best not talk to each other
for the rest of the party.

14:21.567 --> 14:25.242
<i>Oh, back to playing rhythm guitar.</i>
<i>The backup. The human carrot.</i>

14:25.287 --> 14:27.243
You know what, Elena?
I'm not doing this any more.

14:27.287 --> 14:28.800
I love you. You've got to choose.

14:28.847 --> 14:30.883
- What?
- Come on. Gail's had her go.

14:30.927 --> 14:32.918
Now I want first dibs.
She can skulk around

14:32.967 --> 14:35.276
and you can have an affair behind my back.
Except, you know what?

14:35.327 --> 14:37.363
No, you can't,
because I want you all to myself.

14:37.407 --> 14:41.082
The truth is, the spark has kind of gone.

14:41.127 --> 14:42.685
She used to write me poems,

14:42.727 --> 14:45.844
and make me spelt bread
with her bread machine.

14:45.887 --> 14:50.438
And she still does a bit,
but, like, one loaf a month,

14:50.487 --> 14:54.321
and really short poems,
like five or six lines and so on.

14:54.367 --> 14:56.085
She's taking the piss!

14:56.127 --> 15:00.518
Maybe... I should just... end it?

15:00.567 --> 15:02.046
<i>She's mine.</i>

15:02.087 --> 15:04.885
<i>Maybe we'll move to Russia</i>
<i>or wherever the hell she's from.</i>

15:06.447 --> 15:10.440
- I know what you did last summer.
- Sorry, what?

15:10.487 --> 15:13.479
I know that maybe you think
that now that you and "he"

15:13.527 --> 15:17.236
have parted company, that
you're no longer responsible for him.

15:17.287 --> 15:20.962
Well, in my view,
you are your brother's keeper.

15:21.007 --> 15:24.886
Mark, you're drunk. You're talking
gobbledegook and balderdash.

15:24.927 --> 15:26.883
<i>So cold.</i>

15:26.927 --> 15:29.760
<i>She's a heartless supervillain... Hmm.</i>

15:29.807 --> 15:32.162
<i>Maybe Gerard's a little too out of it.</i>

15:32.207 --> 15:35.404
<i>Be awful if Dobby's natural</i>
<i>compassion came into play.</i>

15:35.447 --> 15:37.278
- Mark!
- Dobby!

15:37.327 --> 15:40.364
No need to explain what the hell it is
you've been doing till this time.

15:40.407 --> 15:41.806
Let's get you a drink.

15:41.847 --> 15:45.396
<i>She's herel</i>
<i>But the party's peaked.</i>

15:45.447 --> 15:48.678
<i>Just got to make sure she doesn't</i>
<i>run into Gerard or the poo...</i>

15:48.727 --> 15:50.479
- <i>the items of unpleasantness.</i>
- (DOORBELL RINGS)

15:52.047 --> 15:54.163
Gail. Great you could make it!

15:54.207 --> 15:56.357
- Hi, Jez.
- <i>You're about to get dumped.</i>

15:56.407 --> 15:58.204
- <i>Have a lager.</i>
- Thanks.

15:58.247 --> 16:01.239
<i>Come on in to your emotional torture pit.</i>

16:01.287 --> 16:02.561
Hello, babe.

16:02.607 --> 16:05.075
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>
<i>Kiss goodbye. For ever.</i>

16:06.727 --> 16:07.716
Hello.

16:07.767 --> 16:10.839
Oh, yeah. Hello-o.

16:10.887 --> 16:13.720
You're a very naughty boy,
but that's all right,

16:13.767 --> 16:15.644
cos I don't really like nice boys anyway.

16:15.687 --> 16:17.643
I'd love to stay and chat

16:17.687 --> 16:21.441
but I've got to go and give that
ill-looking man an enormous drink.

16:21.487 --> 16:23.284
Shit. I was on for a biggie.

16:23.327 --> 16:24.919
Is it petering out?

16:24.967 --> 16:28.516
Are you kidding? It's petering up.
It's about to hit maximum peter!

16:28.567 --> 16:30.842
<i>Oh, my fucking life.</i>

16:30.887 --> 16:33.162
Oh, God. Look at that -
some bloody... man has turned up.

16:33.207 --> 16:36.085
Probably from the council.
You'll have to excuse me.

16:36.127 --> 16:40.245
Hi, there. And welcome.
What a surprise.

16:40.287 --> 16:41.845
A party? Thanks for the invite, Mark(!)

16:41.887 --> 16:45.436
It's more of a sort of gathering
that snowballed into a get-together

16:45.487 --> 16:47.205
and mutated into a party.

16:47.247 --> 16:49.317
I was calling and calling
and Dad was down, so...

16:49.367 --> 16:51.517
I want to get everything sorted
and above board, Mark.

16:51.567 --> 16:53.319
But obviously now isn't the right time.

16:53.367 --> 16:55.244
They've showed up, have they?
OK, come on.

16:55.287 --> 16:57.005
Let's do the hucklebuck right here,
right bloody now!

16:57.047 --> 16:59.845
Well, maybe we should just bloody well
get a few things sorted out.

16:59.887 --> 17:02.276
But, but... I'm having... a party?

17:02.327 --> 17:04.477
<i>My party's been pooped.</i>

17:04.527 --> 17:07.963
Jeremy, Dobby mustn't see Gerard.
He's gone over the edge. Get rid of him.

17:08.007 --> 17:08.996
Aye-aye, Captain.

17:09.047 --> 17:12.756
<i>Bet Archer never did baby negotiations</i>
<i>at his parties. Or very rarely.</i>

17:12.807 --> 17:14.718
You two can piss off out of it, pronto!

17:14.767 --> 17:16.803
<i>Jeff and Yvette from my book group?</i>

17:16.847 --> 17:20.156
<i>What kind of mad social chemist</i>
<i>have I become?</i>

17:20.207 --> 17:22.436
<i>Oh, right, can't finish Atonement</i>

17:22.487 --> 17:25.843
<i>but you've got time</i>
<i>to get fingered by Jeff.</i>

17:25.887 --> 17:27.366
<i>Very intellectual, Yvette.</i>

17:27.406 --> 17:29.875
Hope you saw that depth charge
I dropped down your bog.

17:30.807 --> 17:32.320
Something to remember me by.

17:32.367 --> 17:35.086
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>There's a twist in the tale.</i>

17:35.127 --> 17:37.118
<i>Of coursel The butler did itl</i>

17:37.167 --> 17:39.123
<i>I'm so sorry, Suzel</i>

17:39.167 --> 17:41.761
OK, so the headline is, we're not
agreeing to sign a single page

17:41.807 --> 17:44.685
of this legal ball-sack without
visitation rights locked down.

17:44.727 --> 17:46.285
Um, that might be putting it a bit...

17:46.327 --> 17:48.158
What sort of visitation
are you looking for, Mark?

17:48.207 --> 17:50.038
- Saturdays, Sundays and Thursdays.
- Three days?

17:50.087 --> 17:53.682
No, hold on. I was thinking about
taking Italian lessons on Thursdays.

17:53.727 --> 17:55.957
Great(!) Now Thursdays
aren't good for him.

17:56.007 --> 17:57.156
What days <i>do</i> you want?

17:57.207 --> 18:00.005
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>Easter and Shrove Tuesday?</i>

18:00.047 --> 18:03.084
<i>What's he...? Salad spinner?</i>
<i>OK, that's not a bad place to keep it.</i>

18:03.127 --> 18:05.925
Now, our broader contention
is that Sophie's not a fit mother.

18:05.967 --> 18:07.446
SOPHIE: What the fuck
are you talking about?!

18:07.487 --> 18:10.399
No, sorry, we don't mean that.
What are you doing?

18:10.447 --> 18:12.438
It's a bargaining position.
We ask for the whole baby,

18:12.487 --> 18:14.079
we get Thursdays and Wednesdays.

18:14.127 --> 18:17.915
But I don't want Thursdays!
I want to parle Italiano on Thursdays.

18:17.967 --> 18:20.925
- Sort it out, Mark.
- <i>Brilliant party(l)</i>

18:20.967 --> 18:22.878

<i>Others get raided by the police.</i>

18:27.007 --> 18:29.567
<i>I'm going to get raided by</i>
<i>the World Wide Fund For Nature.</i>

18:29.607 --> 18:30.642
...Fuck you.

18:30.687 --> 18:33.997
<i>That'll teach her to write</i>
<i>four- or five-line poems.</i>

18:34.047 --> 18:37.562
<i>Look at all that brilliant crying.</i>

18:37.607 --> 18:41.122
There's another way out of all this for us
all, if you were to do the decent thing.

18:41.167 --> 18:42.316
The decent thing?

18:42.367 --> 18:45.564
There's still a... remnant
of feeling between you.

18:45.607 --> 18:47.563
I could make life
quite comfortable for you.

18:47.607 --> 18:50.997
Give you a job at the seed firm...
light duties.

18:51.047 --> 18:53.277
You'll do all right on 40K,

18:53.327 --> 18:55.761
living in Nana's cottage
with your wife and child.

18:55.807 --> 18:57.559
Is this an offer your client
is on board for?

18:57.607 --> 19:01.361
Oh, I think I can persuade Sophie
to take this seriously.

19:01.407 --> 19:04.160
<i>Maybe I'd be happy,</i>
<i>driving the seed van around,</i>

19:04.207 --> 19:05.845
<i>with my country cottage and my family,</i>

19:05.887 --> 19:08.401
<i>reading the</i> Sunday Times.

19:08.447 --> 19:11.405
<i>It's so thick I can not talk</i>
<i>to anyone all day Sunday.</i>

19:11.447 --> 19:15.076
<i>Monday to Friday,</i>
<i>work and property shows and red wine.</i>

19:15.127 --> 19:19.359
<i>If I can just figure out Saturdays,</i>
<i>maybe it would all be OK.</i>

19:19.407 --> 19:22.444
We'd need 50K...
and an extension on the cottage.

19:22.487 --> 19:23.556
45K and the van.

19:23.607 --> 19:25.404
- Done.
- What?

19:25.447 --> 19:27.802
- Shall we shake on it, Mark?
- <i>Should I shake the man-hand?</i>

19:27.847 --> 19:28.836
Um...

19:28.887 --> 19:32.516
DOBBY: Gerard?
Fucking hell! Are you all right?

19:32.567 --> 19:34.398
What the hell are you doing in there?

19:34.447 --> 19:37.200
- Jeremy said I needed a lie-down.
- Oh, that was nice of him.

19:37.247 --> 19:39.158
Come on, let's get you home.
I'll take you home.

19:39.207 --> 19:43.086
No, don't take him home. He's fine.
He's just had a bit of a disco nap,

19:43.127 --> 19:46.085
and now he's ready to par-tay,
aren't you, Gerard?

19:46.127 --> 19:48.322
Are you all right to stand up
on your own now?

19:48.367 --> 19:52.406
I think... If you wouldn't mind...
just holding me for a bit.

19:52.447 --> 19:53.641
Oh, for God's sake.

19:53.687 --> 19:55.484
Could you call us a cab, please?
We'll share.

19:55.527 --> 19:57.165
The same cab? But...

19:57.207 --> 20:01.485
But you live in Catford and Gerard
lives in Balham. That's miles apart.

20:01.527 --> 20:03.404
It's illogical to share. It's crazy.

20:03.447 --> 20:05.085
I want to make sure he's OK.

20:05.127 --> 20:07.925
Plus, late-night minicabs...

20:07.967 --> 20:09.366
They're licensed, Gerard.

20:09.407 --> 20:10.965
Dobby is not about to get raped,

20:11.007 --> 20:13.237
if that's what you're trying
so snidely to imply.

20:13.287 --> 20:14.766
So let's cut the bullshit, shall we?

20:14.807 --> 20:16.798
It would be more fun
going home together, though.

20:16.847 --> 20:18.599
Oh, right, now we get down to it.

20:18.647 --> 20:22.276
<i>They are not going to have a better time</i>
<i>going home than I'm having at my party.</i>

20:22.327 --> 20:23.521
Hello, yes.

20:23.567 --> 20:26.240
I'd like two cabs, please.
I need <i>two</i> cabs -

20:26.287 --> 20:27.959
one going to Catford

20:28.007 --> 20:32.444
and one separate one going in a completely
different direction, to Balham.

20:32.487 --> 20:33.840
(CHEERING)

20:34.887 --> 20:38.277
- What's going on?
- Gail just asked Elena to marry her.

20:38.327 --> 20:40.557
She's got a proper hetero ring
and everything!

20:40.607 --> 20:41.517
Wow!

20:41.567 --> 20:45.003
<i>Oh, my God</i> - <i>she's grasping at straws.</i>
<i>This is gonna be so embarrassing.</i>

20:45.047 --> 20:46.036
Yes!

20:46.087 --> 20:48.203
(CHEERING)

20:48.247 --> 20:50.283
<i>She said yes.</i>

20:50.327 --> 20:54.286
<i>But... maybe she thinks "no"</i>
<i>is "yes" in English?</i>

20:54.327 --> 20:56.158
Jeremy!

20:56.207 --> 20:57.640
Isn't this amazing?

20:57.687 --> 21:00.281
This really is amazing.

21:00.327 --> 21:03.797
Oh, God. She's the best thing
I've ever had in my life

21:03.847 --> 21:05.678
and I thought she was slipping away.

21:05.727 --> 21:08.241
You can't know how bad that felt.

21:08.287 --> 21:09.606
- Mmm...
- Champagne.

21:12.127 --> 21:13.606
What the fuck?!

21:13.647 --> 21:15.239
- Whoops!
- Whoops?

21:15.287 --> 21:18.996
Oh, the thing is, she gave me
this ring and it was so romantic!

21:19.047 --> 21:23.120
God, this is so weird!
Ah... Is this all right?

21:23.167 --> 21:24.885
It just feels so right!

21:24.927 --> 21:27.361
<i>She's so suggestible.</i>

21:27.407 --> 21:31.639
<i>Like a sexy robot anyone</i>
<i>can hack into and program.</i>

21:31.687 --> 21:33.325
<i>There it goes. Lesbian kiss.</i>

21:33.367 --> 21:37.076
<i>And no-one minds. Where have all the</i>
<i>homophobes gone when you need them?</i>

21:37.127 --> 21:38.799
<i>God, people are so fickle.</i>

21:38.847 --> 21:40.246
What are we celebrating?

21:40.287 --> 21:42.357
Gail and Elena just got engaged.

21:42.407 --> 21:46.320
If it makes you feel any better,
Dobby and Gerard are leaving together.

21:46.367 --> 21:50.201
Right... who's got my rental snake?
I'm gonna lose me deposit.

21:50.247 --> 21:51.475
Wasn't it in the salad spinner?

21:51.527 --> 21:54.519
Empty. We need to find him
while he's still dizzy,

21:54.567 --> 21:57.604
cos if he gets his shit together,
he is gonna be pissed off.

21:57.647 --> 22:00.798
Oh, brilliant(!) So there's a snake
at large in my flat.

22:00.847 --> 22:03.361
I suppose I'm gonna have to buy
a mongoose now, to hunt it.

22:03.407 --> 22:07.639
If your mongoose eats my snake,
I will sue.

22:07.687 --> 22:10.838
<i>So now I have to flat-share</i>
<i>with Jeremy and a snake.</i>

22:10.887 --> 22:12.718
<i>Still, there's a way out.</i>

22:12.767 --> 22:15.520
<i>Nana's cottage. The seed van.</i>

22:15.567 --> 22:17.523
<i>Could get a dog.</i>
<i>What would I call it?</i>

22:17.567 --> 22:19.797
<i>Warwick Kingmaker?</i>

22:19.847 --> 22:21.439
<i>Lambert Simnel?</i>

22:21.487 --> 22:24.877
<i>Too arch. Former Foreign Secretary</i>
<i>Lord Carrington?</i>

22:24.927 --> 22:28.602
<i>Oh, God. This is all too much.</i>
<i>This all too bloody much.</i>

22:28.647 --> 22:30.842
Jez, I think I might have a bong hit.

22:30.887 --> 22:32.366
A bong hit?

22:32.407 --> 22:34.557
Yes. I've organised this whole party

22:34.607 --> 22:38.282
and I haven't had a single bit of fun
all night. So yes, I want a bong hit.

22:39.887 --> 22:42.959
- Light it there and inhale there?
- You've been watching.

22:43.007 --> 22:47.876
<i>Mmm, maybe he'll become a pothead</i>
<i>and he can start buying the stash.</i>

22:49.567 --> 22:50.795
Are you OK?

22:50.847 --> 22:56.001
Fine. Fine. It's... it's not affecting me.
It's not affecting me at all.

22:56.047 --> 23:00.484
Actually... I think I am beginning
to feel something.

23:00.527 --> 23:02.722
- Yeah?
- I think I'm beginning to feel great!

23:02.767 --> 23:05.076
- Great.
- I'm having a good time!

23:05.127 --> 23:06.958
I'm enjoying my party!

23:07.007 --> 23:08.520
(CHEERING)

23:08.567 --> 23:10.285
Sophie, you can have whatever you want.

23:10.327 --> 23:12.921
I'll sign whatever you want,
but I don't want a dog!

23:12.967 --> 23:14.366
A dog? What dog?

23:14.407 --> 23:16.363
I don't want Carrington.

23:16.407 --> 23:19.479
I want... Dobby!

23:19.527 --> 23:22.963
Dobby! Don't go!
Stay here and... marry me!

23:23.007 --> 23:24.599
- What?
- Marry me!

23:24.647 --> 23:26.922
I feel fan... terrible.

23:28.207 --> 23:29.879
It's still there! Where's a puke point?

23:29.927 --> 23:31.997
- Where's a puke point?
- Puke point three, puke point three.

23:32.047 --> 23:33.480
Snake!

23:33.527 --> 23:35.119
(MARK VOMITS)

23:36.367 --> 23:37.516
JEREMY: <i>Ah, poor guy.</i>

23:37.567 --> 23:40.718
<i>I'm not even gonna mention that</i>
<i>he was snitty about my puke points.</i>

23:40.767 --> 23:42.723
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry, everyone.

23:42.767 --> 23:43.995
Come on, Gerard.

23:44.047 --> 23:47.403
MARK: <i>Gerard gets Dobby</i>
<i>and I get a pukey bucket of snake.</i>

23:47.447 --> 23:51.042
You are paying
for that snake to be dry-cleaned.

23:51.087 --> 23:53.920
<i>I bet you probably can get</i>
<i>reptiles dry-cleaned.</i>

23:53.967 --> 23:56.162
<i>That's the world we're living in.</i>

23:56.207 --> 23:58.198
JEREMY: <i>Oh, what a disaster.</i>

23:58.247 --> 24:01.080
<i>Love is all you need?</i>
<i>No, actually, Beatles.</i>

24:01.127 --> 24:05.643
<i>You also need a person</i>
<i>to do it with, Beatles.</i>

24:05.687 --> 24:07.439
Shit.

24:07.487 --> 24:09.125
Hello, Jeremy.

24:09.167 --> 24:12.000
<i>Oh, great. Could turn her down.</i>

24:12.047 --> 24:14.242
<i>Yeah, dream on.</i>

24:14.287 --> 24:15.640
<i>Second lay of the night.</i>

24:15.687 --> 24:17.643
<i>This is the worst party ever.</i>

24:18.967 --> 24:23.085
<i># I'm not sick but I'm not well</i>

24:23.127 --> 24:26.358
<i># And I'm so hot</i>

24:26.407 --> 24:30.844
<i># Cos I'm in hell. #</i>
