WEBVTT

03:01.306 --> 03:02.391
Should we talk?

03:07.604 --> 03:08.856
Are you in trouble?

03:11.608 --> 03:15.404
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have come to your office.

03:15.487 --> 03:17.197
I shouldn't have done that.

03:17.281 --> 03:19.408
I just wasn't in my right mind, you know?

03:22.536 --> 03:24.830
What you were doing,
it just hurt me so much.

03:25.414 --> 03:28.208
Well, then,
I guess I should apologize to you?

03:29.209 --> 03:30.377
Where are my manners?

03:34.173 --> 03:35.215
I'm sorry.

03:38.594 --> 03:39.678
I'm an idiot.

03:42.181 --> 03:45.017
I wanted to hurt you.

03:47.477 --> 03:50.230
I wanted to see you hurt
the way that you hurt me.

03:53.817 --> 03:55.569
Because I'm pathetic.

03:58.447 --> 04:02.367
I know I don't deserve another chance,

04:02.451 --> 04:04.036
but please give me one anyway.

04:07.581 --> 04:08.874
I'll go to rehab.

04:10.334 --> 04:15.547
I'll swallow whatever little bit of pride
that I have left.

04:15.631 --> 04:17.673
I will let you pay-- I will stay.

04:18.841 --> 04:22.387
I won't let Mom pull me out.

04:29.019 --> 04:30.395
I will fix it.

04:36.527 --> 04:37.611
Please.

04:59.758 --> 05:01.718
Look, there's nothing to be nervous about.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.220
It's fine.

05:03.887 --> 05:06.014
Just gotta sit there and take your lumps.

05:06.098 --> 05:07.850
I know what I need to say.

05:07.933 --> 05:09.518
Please let me do the talking.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.937
Hey, can you pull us around back?

05:12.020 --> 05:15.649
-This is fine. This is fine. This is fine.
-It's a zoo out here.

05:15.732 --> 05:19.403
Alex, Alex, right here.
How do you feel about Mitch's death?

05:21.238 --> 05:23.574
When was the last time
you spoke with Mitch?

05:31.039 --> 05:33.083
-Alex! Alex!
-Alex!

05:33.166 --> 05:34.251
Alex! Alex!

05:34.334 --> 05:37.462
Alex, I'm very sorry for your loss.

05:37.546 --> 05:39.715
I know you and Mitch
had a complicated relationship.

05:39.798 --> 05:41.925
It wasn't complicated. They were partners.

05:42.009 --> 05:44.261
One of them was a sexual predator
who was fired,

05:44.344 --> 05:46.138
and one of them suffered the consequences.

05:46.221 --> 05:48.098
And she just visited him? In Italy?

05:48.182 --> 05:50.017
It's a private matter, whatever it is.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.936
And you never would've known
if your employees hadn't committed fraud

05:53.020 --> 05:54.897
and hacked into her credit card and email.

05:54.980 --> 05:55.981
It's fine. It's fi--

05:56.064 --> 05:57.983
Alex has time off
written into her contract.

05:58.066 --> 06:00.694
It's unorthodox to have taken it so early,
but it's kosher.

06:00.777 --> 06:04.198
Doug, either you let us talk,
or you're going out in the hall.

06:06.116 --> 06:08.368
Alex, you're family.

06:08.452 --> 06:12.080
Well, you're closer than family, really,
because we chose to be related.

06:12.164 --> 06:14.041
And we'd never pay our family
25 million per.

06:14.124 --> 06:17.085
That means we love you, no matter what.

06:18.337 --> 06:22.090
If there is any backlash,
we will support you,

06:22.174 --> 06:24.176
and we will get you through this.

06:25.427 --> 06:26.428
Good.

06:27.304 --> 06:28.555
I'm giving it back.

06:28.639 --> 06:30.265
We're not asking for it back.

06:30.349 --> 06:32.142
Wait, what are you giving back?

06:32.226 --> 06:34.311
The money. I'm giving back the money.

06:34.394 --> 06:38.732
Coming back here was a big mistake,
and I can see that now.

06:38.815 --> 06:40.734
This isn't a decision you should make
while you're still--

06:40.817 --> 06:42.986
My mind is made up, Doug. Okay?

06:43.987 --> 06:47.741
I mean, keep your commission.
Absolutely understand that, but

06:48.659 --> 06:51.495
March 16th will be my last day at TMS.

06:51.578 --> 06:53.080
What about prime time?

06:53.163 --> 06:54.414
What am I missing?

06:54.498 --> 06:57.417
Maggie Brener's book comes out
on the 17th.

06:57.501 --> 07:00.921
And there's going to be
some damning information in there on me.

07:12.057 --> 07:13.934
Do you feel comfortable sharing?

07:19.523 --> 07:22.317
She doesn't. And there's a chance
that it never sees the light of day.

07:22.401 --> 07:24.486
YDA shelved their interview
with Maggie, so…

07:24.570 --> 07:27.197
Doug, Stella,

07:27.281 --> 07:29.366
would you give Alex and I
a minute alone, please?

07:29.449 --> 07:30.450
Okay.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.162
Look, Alex, you didn't--

07:34.246 --> 07:36.331
Doug. Come on. Outside.

07:37.124 --> 07:38.125
Thank you.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.187
I'm gonna be canceled…

08:00.147 --> 08:02.232
Cory, for things that I did.

08:03.275 --> 08:07.237
Well, unless I hear that you hurled
racial epithets or homophobic slurs,

08:07.321 --> 08:09.948
I'm not voiding your contract. Dude, no.

08:10.032 --> 08:13.160
So, why don't you go
get the back surgery out of the way?

08:13.243 --> 08:14.745
We'll let Laura fill in for you,

08:14.828 --> 08:17.956
and then you make
this triumphant return to prime time.

08:18.040 --> 08:19.875
I slept with Mitch.

08:23.837 --> 08:27.174
Okay. Well, we have no idea
how this book's gonna play out.

08:27.257 --> 08:29.301
He is a sexual predator.

08:29.843 --> 08:33.597
Your feminist hero slept with the enemy.

08:34.722 --> 08:35.849
Did it on purpose,

08:36.933 --> 08:38.018
not coerced,

08:38.936 --> 08:40.270
while married.

08:40.354 --> 08:43.398
And she doesn't regret it one bit.

08:44.733 --> 08:46.151
That's who I am.

08:46.235 --> 08:49.738
I don't want the money.
I'm done. I'm just done.

08:49.821 --> 08:52.699
You can give it to charity,
but you can't force me to take it back.

08:52.783 --> 08:54.576
Oh, God, Cory.

08:56.662 --> 08:59.164
You ever played pinball, Alex? Pinball.

08:59.248 --> 09:01.875
There are those bumpers on there.

09:01.959 --> 09:04.795
Their only purpose is
to knock the crap out of your ball

09:04.878 --> 09:06.046
and put you off your game.

09:06.129 --> 09:08.882
Now, the more punishment you take,
the more points you can rack up,

09:08.966 --> 09:11.844
but you can't pay attention to them.

09:12.427 --> 09:13.595
It's just noise.

09:13.679 --> 09:15.889
You gotta steel your nerves,
keep your eye on the ball

09:15.973 --> 09:18.725
because the game,
it's actually down at the flippers.

09:18.809 --> 09:20.894
And the flippers, they can send that ball

09:20.978 --> 09:23.063
flying up the ramp so fast,
it'll make your head spin

09:23.146 --> 09:26.608
and that's where
you score the real points.

09:26.692 --> 09:29.486
You just have to
let the flippers do the work.

09:32.865 --> 09:35.033
Thank you
for the very weird pep talk, Cory.

09:35.117 --> 09:36.660
Okay, but sometimes,

09:36.743 --> 09:40.372
and just call it your dumb, silly luck,

09:40.455 --> 09:43.083
you realize that ball
is heading straight down the drain.

09:43.166 --> 09:45.127
It's completely out of the reach
of the flippers,

09:45.210 --> 09:49.173
and you think, "All right, well, I guess
that's the end of the road." Right?

09:49.256 --> 09:51.967
"It's my last ball,
and I'm plumb out of quarters."

09:52.050 --> 09:56.889
That's the moment
you conjure the strength of a mother

09:56.972 --> 09:59.016
whose baby is trapped beneath a Pontiac,

09:59.099 --> 10:02.561
and you tilt the fuck outta
that machine because you can.

10:02.644 --> 10:05.272
I am not taking the money back.

10:05.355 --> 10:09.318
I put my quarters in, and nobody's
gonna forget that I pulled the plunger.

10:10.068 --> 10:12.029
And I got balls left to play.

10:17.659 --> 10:20.287
You'll always have balls
left to play, Cory.

10:20.370 --> 10:21.496
It's who you are.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.753
I just wanna finish out my days
at The Morning Show,

10:28.837 --> 10:32.132
and as I said, I'll be leaving
the day before the book comes out.

10:32.716 --> 10:33.800
So just take care.

10:33.884 --> 10:36.803
Take care of the show and yourself.

10:37.471 --> 10:38.597
Do what you need to do.

10:50.108 --> 10:51.318
Welcome back, Alex.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.071
Thanks, Jimbo.

11:04.998 --> 11:05.999
Okay.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.419
Oh, God.

11:11.380 --> 11:12.464
Yep?

11:13.841 --> 11:14.842
Hello.

11:16.093 --> 11:17.094
Hey.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.930
-Can I come in for a second?
-Yeah, of course.

11:20.848 --> 11:23.475
I'm sorry I left so abruptly.

11:23.559 --> 11:26.270
-Thanks for covering.
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It's okay.

11:26.937 --> 11:28.605
-Yeah.
-How are you?

11:29.273 --> 11:31.859
I'm good. I'll be back Monday.

11:33.485 --> 11:35.779
Are you sure
you don't need a little more time?

11:35.863 --> 11:38.115
No. You know, they advertised you and me,

11:38.198 --> 11:40.576
and I think we should
give them you and me.

11:41.159 --> 11:42.160
Okay.

11:42.870 --> 11:44.413
I just-- I'm not here on Monday.

11:44.496 --> 11:45.873
I…

11:45.956 --> 11:48.333
I have to drop off my brother at rehab.

11:48.417 --> 11:49.918
No.

11:50.002 --> 11:52.337
I am so sorry
you have to deal with that again.

11:52.421 --> 11:53.881
Yeah. Thanks.

11:55.090 --> 11:57.259
Okay, so that means
it'll be me and Daniel.

11:58.302 --> 12:01.471
Well, Laura offered
to fill in for me on Monday,

12:01.555 --> 12:04.808
so maybe you wanna consider
coming back Tuesday instead?

12:06.018 --> 12:07.895
No, I'll be there.

12:07.978 --> 12:10.355
-I'll be there. I'll see you Tuesday.
-Okay.

12:11.815 --> 12:15.110
And maybe we could go get a drink
or something next week?

12:15.194 --> 12:17.571
I just-- I feel like when you came back,

12:17.654 --> 12:20.782
I had all these barriers up,
and it just wasn't fair.

12:23.702 --> 12:26.121
I would really love that. I would.

12:27.039 --> 12:31.835
But you might wanna distance yourself
from me a little.

12:32.794 --> 12:34.087
Distance?

12:35.547 --> 12:36.798
It's for your own--

12:37.674 --> 12:39.176
Yeah, just trust me.

12:41.720 --> 12:42.971
Are you okay?

12:43.055 --> 12:46.517
I'm gonna be fine. Thanks.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.310
-Have a good weekend.
-Okay.

12:48.393 --> 12:49.394
Okay.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.491
Ms. Kessler, I'm sorry for your loss.

13:03.325 --> 13:05.077
That's very nice. Thank you.

13:13.752 --> 13:15.754
-People do know I'm coming, right?
-They do.

13:15.838 --> 13:18.173
Some people will be there,
and some people won't.

13:20.551 --> 13:22.886
I have to do this, but it does feel weird.

13:24.263 --> 13:27.516
Hey, at least you're not wearing a mask.
I feel like Michael Jackson.

13:28.517 --> 13:30.602
You have an excuse for being cautious.

13:36.024 --> 13:37.359
Is Mia avoiding me?

13:37.442 --> 13:39.111
She just had somewhere else to be.

13:39.194 --> 13:41.488
Hello, everyone,
can I have your attention?

13:44.366 --> 13:46.535
Thank you for letting me come in
and talk to you.

13:47.327 --> 13:53.125
For those of you who don't know me,
my name is Paige Jacobs, formerly Kessler.

13:53.876 --> 13:57.004
I know this is odd. An imposition.

13:57.087 --> 14:02.885
And I spent the last day
planning a memorial for someone I hate,

14:03.468 --> 14:06.513
calling the people
I thought might actually attend.

14:07.431 --> 14:08.432
Yeah.

14:08.515 --> 14:15.355
But my youngest asked me this morning
if all of Dad's friends would be there.

14:19.109 --> 14:21.570
Anyway, I'm here because I am a mother.

14:22.988 --> 14:27.701
Mitch's body is still in Italy,
so if that makes it easier.

14:28.410 --> 14:30.579
It'll be a week from Monday.

14:32.414 --> 14:37.002
I apologize if I offended anyone
by being here. Thank you.

14:37.586 --> 14:39.213
I know my way out.

15:27.511 --> 15:30.138
Why aren't we talking to Biden?
We should be talking to the winner.

15:30.222 --> 15:33.350
He did the Sunday show,
so we got Greg Schultz.

15:33.433 --> 15:34.852
Greg Schultz.

15:34.935 --> 15:36.520
Alex, welcome back.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.230
-Hi.
-Hey.

15:38.313 --> 15:39.690
Quick heads-up.

15:39.773 --> 15:41.358
Trying to get ahead of
this coronavirus thing,

15:41.441 --> 15:43.735
so we're going to put studios
in everybody's places.

15:46.572 --> 15:47.948
Studios in our homes?

15:48.031 --> 15:49.992
Yeah.
It's just in case the virus gets bad,

15:50.075 --> 15:51.785
-and it's not gonna be intrusive.
-Oh, God.

15:53.912 --> 15:57.499
Well, I just don't think it's necessary.

15:57.583 --> 16:00.002
But-- Excuse me.

16:00.085 --> 16:01.253
Sure.

16:02.838 --> 16:04.381
-Hey.
-Hey there.

16:05.257 --> 16:07.176
So, I…

16:15.976 --> 16:19.688
I didn't expect to see you today.
I hadn't heard from you.

16:22.024 --> 16:23.692
I wonder how that feels.

16:27.613 --> 16:32.326
Look, I'm gonna stick around
until you find someone new to produce you.

16:33.118 --> 16:34.244
Okay.

16:34.328 --> 16:37.915
Or until you get canceled.
You know, whatever happens first.

16:41.001 --> 16:43.545
-Hey, Alex.
-Hi.

16:43.629 --> 16:46.757
I just wanna make sure
before we head out there.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.258
We're professionals, right?

16:49.718 --> 16:50.719
Of course.

16:50.802 --> 16:53.180
-Great. I will see you out there.
-Okay.

16:53.889 --> 16:55.015
Oh, God.

17:08.111 --> 17:11.114
All right. Here we go.

17:11.198 --> 17:12.491
Yes indeed.

17:14.617 --> 17:17.579
I have a story that happened this weekend.

17:17.663 --> 17:20.457
So, if you don't mind just teeing me up?

17:20.540 --> 17:21.666
Definitely. Of course.

17:21.750 --> 17:23.210
Okay, people.

17:23.292 --> 17:26.338
In five, four, three…

17:29.341 --> 17:30.384
Roll 12.

17:30.467 --> 17:33.554
We just won,
and we've won big because of you.

17:34.263 --> 17:36.265
Good morning. Breaking news last night.

17:36.348 --> 17:40.936
After Joe Biden's decisive victory in
the South Carolina primary this weekend,

17:41.019 --> 17:43.939
former South Bend, Indiana,
Mayor Pete Buttigieg,

17:44.022 --> 17:45.941
dropped out of the race
for the Democratic nomination…

17:46.024 --> 17:49.319
Standby to roll, A. Roll A.

17:49.403 --> 17:53.866
…that I'm delighted to endorse
and support Joe Biden for president.

17:53.949 --> 17:56.869
Breaking overnight,
the second death linked to coronavirus

17:56.952 --> 17:59.288
on US soil has been confirmed.

18:00.455 --> 18:03.292
This doesn't even seem real,
this coronavirus.

18:03.375 --> 18:05.127
-It's out of control.
-I mean--

18:05.210 --> 18:08.589
You know, in '89, Ebola hit US soil,
and we never knew about it.

18:08.672 --> 18:10.132
It was in Richard Preston's book.

18:10.215 --> 18:12.009
-Yeah.
-It's unbelievable.

18:12.092 --> 18:14.970
Can you imagine if we have to
live through that all over again?

18:15.053 --> 18:17.639
-…with Alex Levy…
-Camera two, get ready to make your move.

18:17.723 --> 18:21.018
-…and special guest host, Laura Peterson.
-And cue Alex.

18:21.101 --> 18:23.896
Thank you all for joining us
this Monday morning.

18:23.979 --> 18:26.773
And thank you, Laura,
for joining us again.

18:26.857 --> 18:29.193
Finally getting my turn
to sit next to you.

18:29.276 --> 18:31.486
Well, it's a pleasure for me too.

18:31.570 --> 18:33.155
A busy news weekend.

18:33.238 --> 18:36.158
We're coming up empty
on those COVID-19 tests.

18:36.241 --> 18:37.784
What are you getting COVID tests for?

18:37.868 --> 18:39.745
Do you watch the news?

18:39.828 --> 18:44.458
And here to tell us what we can be doing
to help control the spread of coronavirus

18:44.541 --> 18:48.795
is UBA's chief medical correspondent
Dr. Gwen Zeegers-Bottum.

18:48.879 --> 18:50.506
-Hi.
-Hi.

18:50.589 --> 18:52.174
So the Surgeon General is right.

18:52.257 --> 18:54.218
Some people are surprised to find out

18:54.301 --> 18:56.053
how long they should be
washing their hands.

18:56.136 --> 18:57.930
So, let's do a demonstration.

18:58.013 --> 19:00.349
-Grab a little bit of soap.
-Okay.

19:00.432 --> 19:02.476
Get in there and really scrub. It's--

19:02.559 --> 19:04.186
You wanna get in the crevices.

19:04.269 --> 19:08.273
So the CDC recommends
we wash our hands for about 20 seconds.

19:08.357 --> 19:09.358
For 20 seconds?

19:09.441 --> 19:12.861
And that's about the same length
as singing "Happy Birthday" twice.

19:12.945 --> 19:15.656
That is-- Laura looks shocked.

19:15.739 --> 19:18.033
Well, I mean, I am.
That's a really long time.

19:18.116 --> 19:20.160
It's a lo--
How long have you been washing your hands?

19:20.244 --> 19:22.454
-Thirty years, at least.
-Well, then you're--

19:22.538 --> 19:24.039
you're good.

19:24.122 --> 19:26.875
Hell has frozen over.

19:26.959 --> 19:30.003
Yeah. Well, why don't we make up
our own handwashing song,

19:30.087 --> 19:32.673
-and then we'll be royalty-free?
-Gosh. Okay, hit it.

19:32.756 --> 19:34.758
-Okay.
-You start.

19:34.842 --> 19:37.094
Washing our hands on The Morning Show

19:37.177 --> 19:40.055
Clean, clean hands is the way to go

19:41.682 --> 19:44.142
When Dr. Gwen says to scrub

19:44.226 --> 19:46.144
You don't ever say "no"

19:46.228 --> 19:48.230
Yes!
So now let's get on with the show

19:48.313 --> 19:49.439
-One more time.
-Oh, my gosh.

19:49.523 --> 19:51.525
Washing our hands on The Morning Show

19:51.608 --> 19:53.443
Clean, clean hands is the way to go

19:53.527 --> 19:56.697
When Dr. Gwen says scrub

19:56.780 --> 19:59.116
-Don't say "no"
-Don't you ever, ever say "no"

19:59.199 --> 20:01.535
Now let's get on with the show

20:01.618 --> 20:03.620
Well done. Let's keep our day jobs.

20:20.429 --> 20:21.889
What do you think about this?

20:21.972 --> 20:26.018
I get out of treatment,
we go to Disney World.

20:26.101 --> 20:29.730
-That's for kids, Hal.
-Yeah, but we never got to be kids.

20:30.314 --> 20:33.483
I was just thinking about it in the car.

20:33.567 --> 20:35.944
You remember the one vacation
that we ever tried to take?

20:36.028 --> 20:39.406
Yeah, it was a nightmare.
Mom and Dad got wasted at Epcot.

20:39.489 --> 20:43.493
Yeah, but we'd do it right.
I mean, I won't be drinking.

20:43.577 --> 20:45.746
I can't get away like that. You know that.

20:45.829 --> 20:48.123
It was really hard for me
to get today off.

20:48.207 --> 20:50.501
-And I got Super Tuesday coming up and--
-I understand.

20:50.584 --> 20:52.628
It doesn't have to be that exactly.

20:52.711 --> 20:55.506
We'll just take, like, a long weekend,
you know?

20:55.589 --> 20:57.508
Cooperstown's around here.

20:57.591 --> 20:59.218
We could go to the beach.

20:59.301 --> 21:02.054
Okay, it would just give me something
to look forward to.

21:02.137 --> 21:03.472
Hal, can you just stop?

21:05.891 --> 21:09.436
I love you, but I'm not gonna be able to
see you when you get out.

21:10.812 --> 21:13.315
I'm not gonna be able to talk to you
when you get out.

21:13.857 --> 21:15.984
I just can't. I can't go backwards.

21:16.068 --> 21:19.112
It was hard enough for me
to get where I'm at, and I just-- I can't.

21:19.196 --> 21:21.740
And I can't even fix my own problems.

21:21.823 --> 21:26.161
And I want good things for you
and for Mom, but I just--

21:27.246 --> 21:29.289
I just don't think
it's a good idea to talk.

21:31.792 --> 21:33.085
No, you can't--

21:33.627 --> 21:36.004
You can't do that.
You can't leave me here.

21:36.088 --> 21:38.757
You said you wanted to get better.
This place is the best.

21:38.841 --> 21:41.385
I did all the fucking research.
Go in and get better.

21:41.468 --> 21:43.887
No, what is the fucking point
of going to rehab

21:43.971 --> 21:46.265
if my family's not even gonna be here
when I get out?

21:46.348 --> 21:48.475
What is the point of getting clean?
Fuck you!

21:48.559 --> 21:50.811
-Hal, I'm leaving. Don't follow me!
-I am not staying here!

21:50.894 --> 21:52.271
No, hey, hey. Hey!

21:52.354 --> 21:53.605
-I'm not fucking going in!
-Look--

21:54.189 --> 21:56.567
-God.
-I'm not fucking going inside.

21:56.650 --> 21:58.819
I can't make you go to rehab.
I hope you do.

21:58.902 --> 22:02.239
I want you to get healthy,
but I can't make you do anything.

22:02.322 --> 22:03.907
You are a grown man.

22:03.991 --> 22:06.243
I have paid for this fucking place. Just--

22:06.326 --> 22:08.912
Just figure it out.
I'm leaving, and you can't come with me.

22:08.996 --> 22:11.582
So, what,
you're just gonna fucking strand me?

22:11.665 --> 22:13.041
-I'm not gonna strand you.
-Your fucking brother!

22:13.125 --> 22:15.002
What do you want?
You want money? I have money.

22:15.085 --> 22:16.962
-No--
-Take it. Here's a few hundred dollars.

22:17.045 --> 22:19.715
I don't care about fucking money.
Just go home or something.

22:19.798 --> 22:23.385
Hey, how about I take this fucking money,
and I use it to buy drugs and OD.

22:23.468 --> 22:24.928
You'll never have to fucking see me again

22:25.012 --> 22:26.972
-because I'll be dead!
-Stop threatening me!

22:27.055 --> 22:29.975
Stop it! This is your life!

22:35.063 --> 22:37.107
Go in, don't go in. I don't kn--

22:37.191 --> 22:38.442
Just…

22:38.525 --> 22:39.735
This is your life.

22:43.030 --> 22:45.199
Figure out what you wanna do with it.

23:00.797 --> 23:03.050
-The real at-risk group is the elderly.
-Sorry.

23:03.675 --> 23:06.470
And I want you to call me
if that back starts acting up again.

23:06.553 --> 23:09.223
I will. I will. Thank you so much, Gwen.

23:10.807 --> 23:13.268
-Do you mind?
-No. Be my guest.

23:15.854 --> 23:16.980
So…

23:22.110 --> 23:24.738
So, are you going to the Mitch thing?

23:27.449 --> 23:29.993
Do you remember that night
when a bunch of us went to see

23:30.077 --> 23:31.954
Bring in 'da Noise, Bring in 'da Funk?

23:34.915 --> 23:38.877
It was you, and it was me,
and, Joe, Sydney…

23:40.170 --> 23:42.840
-Maggie--
-No, yeah. I remember.

23:46.718 --> 23:47.886
That was fun.

23:50.264 --> 23:52.516
Yeah. It was.

23:56.061 --> 23:59.231
Why don't you like me? What did I do?

24:03.277 --> 24:04.319
You have no idea?

24:04.403 --> 24:06.530
No. No.

24:07.906 --> 24:10.826
All I know is one day,
you and I were friends,

24:10.909 --> 24:14.413
and then the next day, you pretended
like you didn't even know me.

24:14.496 --> 24:17.374
Really? 'Cause one day
I suddenly didn't like you anymore?

24:18.083 --> 24:21.170
Do you remember what was happening
around that time?

24:21.920 --> 24:26.133
Yes. I do. And it was really hard for you.

24:26.216 --> 24:28.010
And you needed your space.

24:28.093 --> 24:31.597
I needed my space? Did I tell you that?

24:33.473 --> 24:34.474
No.

24:36.310 --> 24:38.770
But we weren't really that close.

24:38.854 --> 24:42.274
Well, we were close enough to go and see
Bring in 'da Noise, Bring in 'da Funk.

24:42.357 --> 24:45.027
I mean, you came to my house for dinner
a bunch that summer.

24:47.571 --> 24:50.073
Well, I was friends with your friends.

24:50.157 --> 24:53.911
And I had just moved to New York.
I just knew that I had liked you.

24:55.746 --> 24:57.456
I was successful.

24:58.165 --> 25:00.501
That was pretty much
your only prerequisite.

25:05.088 --> 25:06.924
Wow. Do you really believe that?

25:07.633 --> 25:11.470
Well, we weren't really friends anymore

25:11.553 --> 25:14.348
after things went south for me, were we?

25:15.557 --> 25:22.439
So all I know is that you moseyed in
on my friends, and you like to talk.

25:22.523 --> 25:26.318
And voilà,
the world knows all my private business.

25:30.781 --> 25:31.823
Yeah.

25:32.658 --> 25:36.995
I guess you're right. I did talk about it.

25:37.663 --> 25:38.914
It was gossip.

25:40.916 --> 25:42.376
Everybody talked about it.

25:45.504 --> 25:48.924
Boy, gossip seemed
so much less vicious back then.

25:50.592 --> 25:53.762
Well, that's because
nobody was gossiping about you yet.

25:56.849 --> 25:59.518
And I imagine
that you had no ill intent, but…

26:01.228 --> 26:02.521
we are our actions.

26:08.151 --> 26:09.152
Yeah.

26:14.408 --> 26:17.578
I wish we had
straightened that out sooner.

26:20.455 --> 26:21.665
What would you have said?

26:23.000 --> 26:27.171
If I asked you back then
if you were gossiping?

26:31.466 --> 26:33.594
I probably would have denied it.

26:36.471 --> 26:37.472
Yeah.

26:39.099 --> 26:42.519
Well, I really enjoyed
doing the show with you today.

26:46.064 --> 26:47.065
Really did.

26:48.108 --> 26:49.484
And it would've been fun

26:50.444 --> 26:52.654
to have been friends
over the last few years.

26:53.155 --> 26:54.865
I'm really sorry I screwed that up.

26:56.074 --> 26:57.075
Hey.

27:00.204 --> 27:01.788
I said shit about you too.

27:04.708 --> 27:06.710
Well, thank you for that.

28:28.584 --> 28:32.421
And in five, four, three…

28:35.048 --> 28:40.095
It's Tuesday, March 3rd, 2020,
and what a Super Tuesday it is.

28:44.766 --> 28:47.519
Now, my first guest
is a giant of television,

28:47.603 --> 28:49.563
a visionary, a humanitarian,

28:49.646 --> 28:52.608
and like all network executives,
a pinhead,

28:52.691 --> 28:53.942
but he's our pinhead.

28:54.026 --> 28:56.820
So please welcome UBA CEO
and the man who locked the door,

28:56.904 --> 28:57.905
Cory Ellison.

29:01.825 --> 29:03.076
That's right.

29:05.162 --> 29:06.788
Well…

29:06.872 --> 29:08.790
Swing it, daddy. Cory, welcome.

29:08.874 --> 29:10.584
Just shaking a leg for you.

29:10.667 --> 29:13.086
-Cory, I'm gonna jump right into this.
-Okay.

29:13.170 --> 29:16.256
Now, why a streaming service, and why now?

29:16.340 --> 29:18.800
-Why now? Well, now is when I live.
-Yeah.

29:18.884 --> 29:21.720
-And why a streaming service at UBA?
-Yeah.

29:21.803 --> 29:26.141
Because I believe in what we do, Peter,
and the power of content compels me.

29:26.225 --> 29:29.436
Wow. Well, Reverend,
can I ask you this question, then?

29:29.520 --> 29:31.813
Why is it that some people
refuse to get on board,

29:31.897 --> 29:33.899
-like this nitwit right here?
-Well…

29:33.982 --> 29:35.526
Is it just sour grapes, do you think?

29:35.609 --> 29:38.237
Everybody's entitled to their own opinion.

29:38.320 --> 29:40.155
-That's a shame.
-Yeah, but I do believe--

29:40.239 --> 29:41.907
Do you know the story
The Princess and the Pea?

29:41.990 --> 29:43.450
-Of course I do.
-Yeah.

29:43.534 --> 29:45.702
Yeah, that's the title
of the Donald Trump Russian sex tape.

29:47.120 --> 29:48.121
Right?

29:48.205 --> 29:49.706
This is a different one
that I'm thinking of.

29:49.790 --> 29:52.084
It's like all of these columnists

29:52.167 --> 29:54.920
think there's someone out there
hiding peas across the land.

29:55.003 --> 29:57.130
And if only they can be
the one to spot the pea

29:57.214 --> 29:58.674
and prove that they're so sensitive,

29:58.757 --> 30:00.592
that it bruised them
and kept them up all night,

30:00.676 --> 30:02.845
then they can make
the world believe they're royalty.

30:02.928 --> 30:05.222
Only, they don't know where the peas are,

30:05.305 --> 30:09.142
so they just act bruised by everything
and hope they guess right one time.

30:09.226 --> 30:11.562
Well, you just took the words
right out of my mouth.

30:12.145 --> 30:15.482
Cory, are you at all concerned
about this Maggie Brener book?

30:15.566 --> 30:18.861
From what I've read,
it's unfortunate, to put it mildly.

30:18.944 --> 30:20.904
But as a network, I'm not concerned.

30:20.988 --> 30:21.989
In fact…

30:23.073 --> 30:27.077
I'd like to invite Maggie on UBA
or UBANC for an interview.

30:27.160 --> 30:29.538
We'd be happy to have her anytime.

30:30.622 --> 30:32.833
You heard it here, folks.
Think that's a scoop.

30:32.916 --> 30:35.085
And I don't even think
we're allowed to do those.

30:35.169 --> 30:37.671
We're gonna continue
to be in a lot of trouble,

30:37.754 --> 30:39.548
and there's gonna be a lot of hurt.

30:42.843 --> 30:45.429
Oh, my God. Meredith.

30:45.512 --> 30:48.891
Two times in two months, Meredith?
I mean-- What, are you stalking me now?

30:48.974 --> 30:51.393
Hey. Yeah, funny.

30:51.476 --> 30:52.811
How you been? You be--

30:55.689 --> 30:56.982
Yanko.

30:58.358 --> 30:59.359
What?

31:00.027 --> 31:02.029
I mean,
I can't believe I'm running into you here.

31:02.112 --> 31:05.282
What? I'm the one who told you
about this place.

31:07.701 --> 31:10.412
So, what are you--
I mean, what are you guys up to?

31:10.495 --> 31:12.372
We're about to head uptown.

31:12.456 --> 31:15.459
You know, it's okay.
I can meet up with you later.

31:15.542 --> 31:16.627
Unless you're busy?

31:20.464 --> 31:22.799
…for less than ten dollars.

31:22.883 --> 31:26.345
All right, so you're gonna receive
12 Whitetail Cutlery.

31:26.428 --> 31:28.555
It's been in our line for decades.

31:28.639 --> 31:31.683
I actually first started selling them
when I was doing shows.

31:35.020 --> 31:36.104
Hey.

31:37.231 --> 31:39.274
Do you want me to ask why you're not okay?

31:40.567 --> 31:42.361
No. Not really.

31:43.487 --> 31:46.114
I saw you on Bullard.
You were really good.

31:46.198 --> 31:47.324
Thank you for noticing.

31:47.407 --> 31:49.493
So you know how I offered
to have Maggie on.

31:50.077 --> 31:51.245
Yeah. She accepted?

31:52.037 --> 31:53.163
Will you do it?

31:54.081 --> 31:56.208
Interview her Monday night?

31:56.708 --> 31:57.835
The book's coming out,

31:57.918 --> 31:59.878
and I know
I said I'm not concerned about it,

32:00.921 --> 32:01.922
but I am.

32:02.506 --> 32:04.758
And I know Alex is too.

32:04.842 --> 32:07.386
We haven't read it yet,
but you'd get an advance copy.

32:08.470 --> 32:09.596
Why me?

32:11.473 --> 32:14.726
Because, Bradley, I know you'll be fair.

32:18.814 --> 32:20.190
Okay. I can do it.

32:21.942 --> 32:24.862
Thank you. I'll set it up.

32:24.945 --> 32:25.946
Bye.

32:33.829 --> 32:35.414
-Especially here.
-What time is it?

32:35.497 --> 32:37.332
-I don't know.
-I should go.

32:37.416 --> 32:40.043
Wow. I guess it got late.

32:40.127 --> 32:41.879
-I leave town next week.
-Come on.

32:41.962 --> 32:44.506
But do you maybe
want to get together again?

32:44.590 --> 32:46.425
-I don't know.
-It would have to be Monday.

32:46.508 --> 32:49.052
No. I can't Monday. I can do Tuesday.

32:49.136 --> 32:50.679
-No, that's the only day I can do.
-No.

32:50.762 --> 32:52.472
-Can you not reschedule?
-No, I really can't.

32:53.098 --> 32:55.184
Come on. What's so important?

32:56.018 --> 32:58.562
I'm going to a memorial service.

33:01.732 --> 33:04.067
You're not going to
Mitch Kessler's memorial, are you?

33:06.612 --> 33:07.821
I am.

33:07.905 --> 33:09.364
I am. I worked with him a long time.

33:09.448 --> 33:11.617
He raped my friend.

33:12.326 --> 33:15.829
-Okay. I'm sorry, all right?
-He raped Hannah.

33:15.913 --> 33:17.873
And you're memorializing him?

33:17.956 --> 33:19.708
I knew this was gonna be a loaded subject.

33:19.791 --> 33:21.752
That's why I didn't wanna bring him up.
Okay?

33:21.835 --> 33:23.837
How does not telling me
make it any better?

33:23.921 --> 33:26.173
No, it doesn't, but I-- Where you going?

33:26.256 --> 33:28.258
I can explain why it's important
if you give me a minute.

33:28.342 --> 33:30.010
He killed my friend!

33:30.093 --> 33:32.721
-He didn't kill her. She OD'd.
-I'm glad he's dead.

33:32.804 --> 33:37.434
I should only hope that Fred Micklen
and his 119.2 million aren't far behind.

33:37.518 --> 33:38.936
He might have to give all that back

33:39.019 --> 33:40.687
'cause Hannah's dad's suing him
and the network.

33:40.771 --> 33:43.732
I know. Who do you think's paying for it?
Hannah's dad?

33:45.359 --> 33:47.319
What? What are you saying?

33:47.402 --> 33:49.738
I was so horrible to her
the night she died.

33:49.821 --> 33:51.657
-I had to do something.
-Claire.

33:51.740 --> 33:53.534
You can't blame yourself
for what happened.

33:53.617 --> 33:57.037
-Don't tell me what to do. Thank you.
-What are you doing?

33:57.120 --> 33:59.748
What are you doing? Where you going?
Claire? Claire, come on!

34:10.342 --> 34:11.717
Buzz us if you need anything.

34:12.302 --> 34:15.054
And if you need to take a break,
we'll have someone walk you outside.

34:15.138 --> 34:16.389
Okay, great. Thank you.

34:42.165 --> 34:44.751
"Hurricane Alex
wasn't just the stuff of legend.

34:44.835 --> 34:48.422
It was the stuff of campfire horror story.

34:48.922 --> 34:52.426
Mitch Kessler and Alex Levy
were inseparable.

34:52.509 --> 34:57.389
Levy had a blind spot for him.
If Kessler did it, it couldn't be wrong.

34:57.472 --> 35:01.977
Nobody could have expected what Levy saw
when she opened his dressing room door."

35:02.060 --> 35:03.562
Oh, my God.

35:03.645 --> 35:06.481
"And it was in that Chilean hotel room

35:06.565 --> 35:11.737
that Kessler and Levy consummated
their on-air and off-air sexual tension.

35:12.821 --> 35:18.243
Everybody is flawed, but Levy is damaged."

35:24.458 --> 35:26.960
Do you know
if they're still doing Mitch's memorial?

35:27.044 --> 35:28.337
As far as I know.

35:29.922 --> 35:31.882
You know, I don't think it's a good idea

35:31.965 --> 35:34.009
for you to be in a crowded place
right now.

35:34.092 --> 35:36.261
And I don't think you owe it to Mitch.

35:36.345 --> 35:38.764
It's not your job to protect me anymore.

35:48.440 --> 35:50.943
Mitch never stopped loving baseball.

35:52.194 --> 35:56.323
And I'd like to think
that's he's with his mom and dad now…

35:58.408 --> 35:59.409
stealing home.

36:00.869 --> 36:04.081
Let's all celebrate.

36:04.164 --> 36:06.500
Be happy remembering Mitch.

36:09.503 --> 36:10.838
God bless you, Mitchy.

36:15.384 --> 36:16.802
With love, Uncle Mike.

36:27.563 --> 36:30.774
You know, I know everyone wants to pretend

36:32.067 --> 36:38.448
that death isn't the most
profoundly sad thing to befall a life.

36:39.616 --> 36:44.538
And everyone wants to laugh
and dance and sing and have fun, and--

36:45.789 --> 36:47.833
'Cause Mitch would've wanted it that way.

36:49.084 --> 36:51.628
This is a celebration of life, isn't it?

36:53.297 --> 36:54.756
I have to tell you…

36:56.633 --> 36:58.760
that it turns my stomach.

37:02.139 --> 37:05.184
Because if any of you had cared

37:06.268 --> 37:09.730
remotely what Mitch wanted,

37:11.565 --> 37:14.276
do you know when the time
would've been to share it?

37:16.445 --> 37:19.198
I don't know.
How about when he was still alive?

37:19.281 --> 37:21.867
-That's enough!
-A heckler.

37:23.202 --> 37:27.206
Why are you so scared
of someone speaking his mind?

37:27.706 --> 37:28.916
Now,

37:30.292 --> 37:35.297
listen, Mitch was not a perfect person.

37:37.174 --> 37:39.885
He wasn't a great driver, for example.

37:42.846 --> 37:45.182
Oh, boy. I know. Too soon.

37:47.476 --> 37:49.645
You know who would've laughed at that?

37:52.940 --> 37:55.567
Young Mitchell would've laughed at that.

37:57.444 --> 38:00.989
Maybe the world has to
stop playing games with people's lives.

38:01.573 --> 38:04.076
Maybe they have to stop judging people

38:04.910 --> 38:09.164
for ordering something
from a different page of the sexual menu.

38:10.707 --> 38:14.378
Stop treating people
like single-use plastic,

38:14.461 --> 38:16.380
because you may never see them again.

38:17.881 --> 38:24.263
But there is a mountain of dead reprobates
somewhere in the Orient.

38:24.930 --> 38:30.143
And, someday, each and every one
of our death certificates will read,

38:30.227 --> 38:34.857
"Cause of death: cancel culture."

38:35.858 --> 38:36.859
God.

38:38.735 --> 38:42.072
I'm so sorry this happened to you, Mitch.

38:46.159 --> 38:47.578
I'm so sorry…

38:52.124 --> 38:57.754
that we never got to make our peace.

39:00.132 --> 39:01.633
You were a good friend to me…

39:04.052 --> 39:05.554
for a long time.

39:07.848 --> 39:09.349
A long time.

39:17.316 --> 39:18.400
Fuck 'em!

40:07.032 --> 40:08.033
Hi.

40:09.785 --> 40:12.621
Paola. I'm so glad you made it.

40:12.704 --> 40:15.415
-Thank you. Thank you for the flight.
-Of course.

40:15.499 --> 40:19.878
It feels sort of funny to be here
at his funeral when he isn't.

40:20.629 --> 40:24.591
Crazy world,
but I'm glad there is one friendly face.

40:27.678 --> 40:29.805
Actually, Mitch--

40:29.888 --> 40:30.889
I promised Mitch

40:30.973 --> 40:35.644
that I would introduce you
to the right people in the business

40:35.727 --> 40:36.895
when you're ready.

40:36.979 --> 40:41.608
Well, I've thrown myself into my work
since Mitch died.

40:41.692 --> 40:43.610
But I'm not ready yet.

40:44.820 --> 40:47.030
It's been a very emotional time,

40:47.114 --> 40:49.575
and I'll let you know
when I come up for air.

40:50.409 --> 40:52.536
Okay. Well, I just don't know

40:53.370 --> 40:55.789
how long people are gonna be
returning my phone calls.

40:55.873 --> 40:59.168
So you might wanna come up for air
a little bit quicker.

40:59.251 --> 41:00.919
Okay. Thank you.

41:01.003 --> 41:03.297
-Excuse me for a second, okay?
-Of course. Of course.

41:07.551 --> 41:08.552
Excuse me.

41:09.928 --> 41:12.472
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

41:15.893 --> 41:17.144
I wasn't gonna come, but

41:18.729 --> 41:21.982
I just kept feeling that I had to

41:23.859 --> 41:29.239
and to say a few words about Mitch

41:29.948 --> 41:31.491
and what he meant to me.

41:32.618 --> 41:34.286
Paige, please bear with me.

41:45.214 --> 41:46.590
Some--

41:51.845 --> 41:52.971
Sorry.

41:55.390 --> 41:57.601
Some people are just never satisfied.

41:59.436 --> 42:00.437
And…

42:03.065 --> 42:05.025
by satisfied, I mean fulfilled.

42:05.609 --> 42:08.445
I include myself in that group.

42:17.579 --> 42:18.622
You should--

42:18.705 --> 42:21.333
And it's always a "should."
It always starts with a "should."

42:22.501 --> 42:24.920
You should always be striving for more.

42:25.003 --> 42:28.966
You should always strive
to get to that next rung of the ladder.

42:29.633 --> 42:33.303
Should always just keep wanting more.

42:38.809 --> 42:44.648
But if you just spend all of your time
wanting more, striving for more,

42:45.983 --> 42:48.277
you don't spend any of your time…

42:50.654 --> 42:51.655
living.

43:00.289 --> 43:05.919
Mitch made unforgivable choices.

43:08.964 --> 43:10.048
And…

43:12.050 --> 43:14.136
Yes. Yeah.

43:14.219 --> 43:17.055
I went to see Mitch in Italy.

43:22.477 --> 43:24.188
I saw him the day he died.

43:28.483 --> 43:30.194
And I wanted you to know that

43:31.528 --> 43:36.158
he was really starting
to understand the effects of his actions.

43:38.994 --> 43:42.122
He was remorseful.

43:45.918 --> 43:49.046
He wanted to do better.
He wanted to be better.

43:51.507 --> 43:55.928
And I know that's not enough.
And it will never, ever be enough. Ever.

43:57.012 --> 43:59.556
But I just wanted you to know that.

44:04.811 --> 44:07.648
And I also wanted him
to be remembered for that too.

44:12.986 --> 44:15.614
Mitch had a beautiful family

44:15.697 --> 44:18.659
with two beautiful boys
and a wife he knew he did not deserve.

44:21.203 --> 44:22.204
Paige.

44:24.122 --> 44:26.083
I'm just so sorry for all of it.

44:39.346 --> 44:41.139
Well, you tell me.

44:41.223 --> 44:46.228
That day I interviewed you last year,
I also went to a fundraiser at Alex Levy's

44:46.311 --> 44:49.439
where she told me that she had coached you

44:49.523 --> 44:52.317
on how best
to get to Ashley Brown's truth.

44:52.401 --> 44:56.947
She was positioning herself
as sort of a paragon of feminism.

44:57.447 --> 44:59.658
You're the truth-teller. Was that true?

45:01.785 --> 45:02.953
Not exactly.

45:04.371 --> 45:05.581
There you go.

45:05.664 --> 45:07.791
Are you watching this? Alex?

45:08.417 --> 45:10.836
Alex? You've gotta call me back.

45:13.589 --> 45:15.257
Do you know how I got this job?

45:16.341 --> 45:18.468
I have some sense of it.

45:18.552 --> 45:20.429
Yeah, I think you do.

45:20.512 --> 45:21.930
But you didn't put it in the book.

45:22.014 --> 45:24.141
Well, you can't include everything.

45:24.725 --> 45:26.518
I was actually kinda disappointed.

45:26.602 --> 45:28.645
I wonder if you wanna break it here.

45:28.729 --> 45:30.814
It's a pretty interesting story,
don't you think?

45:30.898 --> 45:33.192
Please, feel free. In your own words.

45:33.275 --> 45:37.196
Okay. In my vaguest recollection,

45:37.279 --> 45:41.909
you were not even of the remotest
consideration to replace Mitch.

45:42.534 --> 45:45.037
-And then what happened?
-And then Alex Levy,

45:45.120 --> 45:48.415
in a game of cat and mouse
that she often believes she's playing,

45:48.498 --> 45:52.920
announced you completely out of nowhere
to be her coanchor.

45:53.462 --> 45:57.257
And it absolutely shocked everybody
at the network,

45:57.341 --> 46:00.552
but Alex had backed them all
into a corner,

46:00.636 --> 46:03.222
and there was nothing they could do
to get rid of you. So…

46:04.181 --> 46:06.391
See, that's an interesting story.

46:06.892 --> 46:07.893
And it's true.

46:08.810 --> 46:10.062
So, why didn't you print it?

46:10.145 --> 46:12.940
Okay. If you wanna do this.

46:13.440 --> 46:15.567
You did lie when I interviewed you.

46:15.651 --> 46:20.572
You didn't say any of what I just said,
which you are now admitting to be true.

46:21.281 --> 46:23.450
No, you're right. I guess I lied.

46:23.534 --> 46:26.036
And I didn't want people
knowing my private business.

46:26.119 --> 46:28.789
-Yeah, well…
-Doesn't make me look very good right now.

46:29.540 --> 46:31.959
But I do think
I've been doing a pretty good job,

46:32.042 --> 46:34.962
and I wouldn't have had that opportunity
if it wasn't for her.

46:38.131 --> 46:40.676
I wonder why so much
of your book is dedicated

46:40.759 --> 46:44.388
to Alex and Mitch Kessler's
consensual relationship.

46:44.972 --> 46:47.975
I mean, sure, it's an extramarital affair.
I see that.

46:48.058 --> 46:51.061
But, at this point,
that feels sort of quaint.

46:51.144 --> 46:54.439
And there are a myriad terrible things
that Mitch has done that you say in here,

46:54.523 --> 46:56.441
and those seem like fair game.

46:58.110 --> 47:00.195
But why rope Alex into it?

47:00.737 --> 47:03.949
I mean, did you have
something personal against Alex Levy?

47:04.032 --> 47:05.576
No, no, no. No, I don't.

47:06.368 --> 47:07.661
In fact, I…

47:08.453 --> 47:11.707
I held some things back
because they seemed unkind.

47:11.790 --> 47:13.333
Really? Wow. I mean,

47:13.417 --> 47:16.628
-I hear you saying that, but--
-Okay, you wanna push me?

47:16.712 --> 47:18.005
I'll play.

47:18.088 --> 47:21.008
Just last month, I was in Las Vegas,
where I know you were too.

47:21.091 --> 47:23.010
-Good job on the debate, by the way.
-Thank you.

47:23.093 --> 47:25.762
And I was sitting in my hotel room
late at night,

47:25.846 --> 47:30.225
this is the night before the debate,
just minding my own business,

47:31.143 --> 47:35.397
when suddenly,
your coanchor began knocking on my door,

47:36.064 --> 47:37.983
losing her mind.

47:41.904 --> 47:42.905
Alex?

47:43.947 --> 47:46.783
-She was losing her mind?
-Losing her mind.

47:47.326 --> 47:49.870
I say that with no judgment.
It was a fact.

47:52.623 --> 47:54.875
She wanted to know
if I had an extra copy of my book.

47:54.958 --> 47:56.126
I said I did not.

47:57.836 --> 47:59.880
Well, did she say why?

48:00.631 --> 48:02.174
She wanted to know if I had included

48:02.257 --> 48:04.760
the part about
her sleeping with Mitch Kessler.

48:05.761 --> 48:07.930
I told her I had.

48:08.972 --> 48:10.974
And what did she want you to do?

48:11.558 --> 48:12.851
To take it out.

48:18.440 --> 48:21.818
So, a woman that you have known
for a very long time

48:21.902 --> 48:25.447
came to you in major distress
over a mistake

48:25.531 --> 48:27.366
that she made how many years ago?

48:27.449 --> 48:28.992
Ten, but she's a journalist. So…

48:29.076 --> 48:32.871
Okay. Well, it was a mistake
that happened ten years ago.

48:33.455 --> 48:37.501
And she was in major distress,
and she asked you to take it out,

48:37.584 --> 48:39.670
and you published it anyway?

48:41.797 --> 48:44.007
Who's the worst person
you ever slept with, Maggie?

48:44.091 --> 48:45.133
I'm just curious.

48:45.217 --> 48:46.927
How terrible of a person are you?

48:49.513 --> 48:50.514
Bradley,

48:51.265 --> 48:57.646
my book is about a corrupt network
hiding sexual misconduct.

48:57.729 --> 49:01.066
Just a litany of inappropriate behavior.

49:01.149 --> 49:06.405
And, yes, there are plenty of stories
that also show you the real Alex Levy.

49:06.488 --> 49:09.616
I agree. And you do hold
the network accountable,

49:09.700 --> 49:13.245
but it's interesting
that Alex is the cover of this book.

49:13.954 --> 49:17.457
And this Alex Levy is
the woman who gave me my career.

49:17.541 --> 49:18.834
Pretty nice of her, isn't it?

49:18.917 --> 49:21.628
But she didn't do it for you, Bradley.
She did it for her.

49:21.712 --> 49:25.132
Well, you don't get to where she is
by making other people's lunch.

49:25.215 --> 49:26.466
I know you know that.

49:27.050 --> 49:28.594
I mean, you're sitting here

49:28.677 --> 49:31.930
because you are publicizing
a very high-profile book

49:32.014 --> 49:36.476
with stories from five, ten, 15 years ago.

49:36.560 --> 49:40.814
But the one story you didn't publish
was the story of a changed woman,

49:40.898 --> 49:45.944
who came to you and begged for mercy,
and you declined.

49:46.987 --> 49:50.908
Instead,
you put her on the cover of your book.

49:52.451 --> 49:54.995
Now, you do know
that Alex and I broke the story

49:55.078 --> 49:57.623
about Fred Micklen
right here on this network.

49:57.706 --> 50:00.959
That we risked our careers
just to get the truth out there.

50:02.586 --> 50:05.589
Yeah, I know you know
because we scooped you, didn't we?

50:05.672 --> 50:06.965
Rightly so.

50:08.967 --> 50:11.303
There's a lot of stories
about Alex Levy in this book,

50:12.304 --> 50:14.431
but I think that's the old Alex Levy.

50:15.015 --> 50:17.768
And I think that people change.

50:18.852 --> 50:20.187
I think people grow.

50:20.771 --> 50:24.274
I know I'm evolving. I wonder if you are.

50:27.069 --> 50:29.821
I'm being told
that it's time for a commercial.

50:29.905 --> 50:33.242
But we will be back
with more Maggie Brener.

50:47.673 --> 50:50.175
What on earth?

50:58.892 --> 51:00.227
You gotta be kidding me.

51:04.773 --> 51:06.233
Thank God.

51:07.025 --> 51:08.277
Oh, God.

51:14.116 --> 51:15.909
Oh, God.

51:15.993 --> 51:18.120
You're an interesting girl, Bradley.

51:19.329 --> 51:21.206
What's so interesting about me?

51:22.040 --> 51:24.376
Well, you know, a couple of months ago
when we first met,

51:24.459 --> 51:28.589
all you talked about was
how much you didn't like Alex

51:28.672 --> 51:29.840
and that she was unfair.

51:29.923 --> 51:32.217
No. I didn't say I didn't like Alex.

51:32.301 --> 51:33.468
Well, close enough.

51:33.552 --> 51:37.723
But the point is,
tonight you had the chance to bury her,

51:38.223 --> 51:41.602
but instead, you went
so far out of your way to defend her.

51:41.685 --> 51:44.021
And in the process,
you buried the person who wrote the book

51:44.104 --> 51:46.273
that had everything in it
you wanted exposed.

51:47.274 --> 51:49.151
How does any of that make sense?

51:49.234 --> 51:51.320
Well, I do believe everything I said.

51:51.945 --> 51:55.115
I just-- I really don't feel
like Maggie was being fair.

51:55.199 --> 51:58.368
And how I feel about Alex is
of minor relevance.

51:58.952 --> 52:01.538
Well, it was pretty goddamn impressive.

52:02.039 --> 52:04.124
You are impressive in a lot of ways.

52:04.708 --> 52:06.960
Thank you. That's better than interesting.

52:13.008 --> 52:17.638
You know, with my heart condition
and COVID,

52:17.721 --> 52:23.060
I'm gonna go to my place
in Montana for a month or two,

52:23.143 --> 52:25.103
whenever this is over.

52:25.729 --> 52:30.776
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, sure. That makes sense.

52:32.778 --> 52:35.614
But I'm gonna miss you. A lot.

52:38.867 --> 52:41.036
You should think about
coming out to stay with me.

52:43.163 --> 52:45.332
But I'm on TV five days a week.

52:46.667 --> 52:49.127
So, give it up. For me.

52:50.712 --> 52:52.840
I don't like it when my woman works.

52:53.423 --> 52:54.675
Are you serious?

52:55.968 --> 52:57.970
No, I'm not serious.

52:58.053 --> 52:59.930
I have a little studio on the ranch.

53:00.013 --> 53:01.890
No. Not that.

53:04.226 --> 53:05.686
Am I your woman?

53:09.064 --> 53:12.526
Well, I'm not gonna lie to you.

53:12.609 --> 53:15.237
You do scare me a little.

53:15.904 --> 53:17.030
Okay.

53:17.531 --> 53:19.616
But, yeah.

53:21.577 --> 53:22.744
Something like that.

53:34.131 --> 53:36.967
-Wow, really? That's timing.
-I'll be right back.

53:37.050 --> 53:39.678
Okay. I'll be in the bedroom.

53:43.557 --> 53:46.435
-Hey, Harry. What can I do for you?
-Someone dropped this off earlier.

53:46.518 --> 53:48.854
Thanks.
I'll get you something, just a minute.

53:55.527 --> 53:56.987
When did they drop this off?

53:57.070 --> 54:00.657
I'm not sure. It was before my shift.
Maybe five or six hours ago.

54:00.741 --> 54:02.492
Can you find out? It's really important.

54:02.576 --> 54:04.036
-Of course.
-Thank you.

54:23.055 --> 54:24.264
Oh, God.

54:43.492 --> 54:44.576
No.

54:45.202 --> 54:46.203
No.

54:47.037 --> 54:48.038
No.

54:51.625 --> 54:52.626
Fuck.

54:53.710 --> 54:54.711
Fuck.

54:57.714 --> 55:01.093
I mean, what can you say,
other than, "Wow"?

55:01.176 --> 55:03.387
Bradley Jackson
did a hell of a job convincing us

55:03.470 --> 55:05.681
that Alex Levy was a changed person

55:05.764 --> 55:07.724
and that we shouldn't
hold her past against her.

55:07.808 --> 55:09.935
But this just happened.

55:10.018 --> 55:12.187
I went to see Mitch in Italy.

55:12.938 --> 55:14.690
I saw him the day that he died.

55:14.773 --> 55:16.400
-The day that he died?
-Oh, God.

55:16.483 --> 55:19.152
I thought she wasn't
in a relationship with him anymore.

55:19.236 --> 55:21.280
That was supposed to be ten years ago.

55:21.363 --> 55:24.825
Not to mention she endangered
her coworkers with a deadly virus.

55:24.908 --> 55:27.578
It brings up some very
uncomfortable questions.

55:27.661 --> 55:30.080
Why was she involved with
a known sexual abuser?

55:30.163 --> 55:32.040
And how did Kessler really die?

55:32.124 --> 55:33.375
First Jeffrey Epstein--

55:47.264 --> 55:48.265
Oh, God.

55:50.475 --> 55:53.061
What? What the fuck?

55:53.145 --> 55:55.105
There's no room inside the hospital.

55:55.189 --> 55:57.566
We are making tents outside the hospital

55:57.649 --> 56:00.110
to care for patients and…

56:00.194 --> 56:01.195
Oh, God.

56:04.489 --> 56:06.325
Doug, what the fuck? What's happening?

56:06.408 --> 56:08.076
Good to hear your voice.

56:08.160 --> 56:10.037
You fell and hit your head
during the night.

56:10.120 --> 56:11.455
Chip found you.

56:11.538 --> 56:14.166
Minor concussion.
And sorry about the other thing.

56:14.249 --> 56:16.001
Yeah. I got canceled.

56:16.084 --> 56:17.711
Well, yeah. But…

56:18.587 --> 56:20.005
They haven't told you?

56:20.964 --> 56:22.257
What? Told me what?

56:22.341 --> 56:23.926
I should let the doctor tell you.

56:24.009 --> 56:26.261
No, no. Come on, Doug.
You're scaring me. Come on.

56:26.345 --> 56:29.014
They tested you in the emergency room,

56:29.097 --> 56:33.227
and you tested positive for COVID.

56:34.144 --> 56:35.437
Fuck.

56:36.396 --> 56:37.689
Fuck.
