Same thing your
mom always said.

00:24.111 --> 00:25.373
She also used to say
that your dad and you

00:25.416 --> 00:27.375
were her favorite clients.

None of that "procrastinating

you should wait till then.

coming to yours.

in the glove box?

Okay. Full immunity.

Melissa, it's pretty hard
to get off the 14th floor

with my new clients,

01:46.802 --> 01:49.109

Okay.

He had her making
monthly payments to someone.

01:57.421 --> 01:59.467
Her files only go back

01:59.510 --> 02:02.644

it's been even longer than that.

02:03.601 --> 02:06.387
Any notation in her accounting?

02:06.430 --> 02:08.650
Uh, no charitable deductions,
no nothing.

this is a robbery.

11:44.747 --> 11:45.879
and they just move on.

11:45.922 --> 11:47.794
Look...

11:47.837 --> 11:50.013
are you sure
this is just some kid

11:50.057 --> 11:51.058
who's a troll?

11:51.101 --> 11:52.407
Who else would it be?

11:53.538 --> 11:55.845
You remember that woman,
the social studies teacher

11:55.889 --> 11:57.368
who went after Nicky
a few years ago?

11:57.412 --> 11:58.543
A teacher?

11:58.587 --> 11:59.675
The certified cop hater

11:59.719 --> 12:01.285
who was a cop hater long before

12:01.329 --> 12:02.722
it became everyone's
favorite hobby to hate cops?

12:02.765 --> 12:04.027
That one?

12:04.071 --> 12:06.073
[sighs]

12:07.074 --> 12:09.554
Do me a favor and don't say
nothing to her, okay?

12:09.598 --> 12:11.382
Dad, no.

12:11.426 --> 12:12.949
Just gonna suss her out,
that's all.

12:12.993 --> 12:13.907
No, you're not.

12:17.171 --> 12:19.390
You know, I happen to be
a pretty good detective.

12:19.434 --> 12:21.566
Yeah. But this is my business.

12:21.610 --> 12:23.743
So you're gonna butt out.

12:28.791 --> 12:30.793
[utensil stirring]

12:40.455 --> 12:42.152
Go on, say it.

12:43.110 --> 12:45.199
What?

12:45.242 --> 12:47.897
Oh, I know.
Something smells delicious.

12:47.941 --> 12:49.420
Damn straight.

12:49.464 --> 12:51.771
Good.

12:51.814 --> 12:53.816
One of my few regrets

12:53.860 --> 12:56.863
is that I learned how
to really cook so late in life.

12:56.906 --> 12:59.082
I bet you I could've saved

12:59.126 --> 13:01.084
over a million bucks in takeout,
you add it all up.

13:01.128 --> 13:03.043
Saved for what?

13:04.044 --> 13:05.262
What do you mean?

13:06.263 --> 13:08.788
Well, somebody talks
about savings,

13:08.831 --> 13:10.702
they usually have
a goal in mind.

13:12.661 --> 13:14.619
Do I need a lawyer?

13:14.663 --> 13:16.404
[chuckles]

13:16.447 --> 13:18.710
It's just a question, Pop.

13:18.754 --> 13:20.843
Francis.

13:20.887 --> 13:23.411
I remember how to lead a perp.

13:23.454 --> 13:25.500
What the hell
are you looking for?

13:27.632 --> 13:28.851
Okay.

13:32.159 --> 13:34.726
Melissa came to my office today.

13:36.728 --> 13:39.079
[mouths]

13:39.122 --> 13:41.646
That's privileged information.

13:41.690 --> 13:43.735
What is?

13:43.779 --> 13:45.259
What do you mean, what is?

13:45.302 --> 13:49.132
Well, all I said was,
she came to my office.

13:49.176 --> 13:50.960
That's not
privileged information.

13:51.004 --> 13:53.397
This ends right now.

13:53.441 --> 13:55.008
This is my business
and mine only.

13:55.051 --> 13:56.574
Which I respect...

13:56.618 --> 13:57.662
Then show it.

13:57.706 --> 13:59.012
You think

13:59.055 --> 14:01.275
I'm some old coot
that's being scammed.

14:01.318 --> 14:03.059
That's where
this is going, right?

14:03.103 --> 14:05.888
The only place it's going is
you flying off the handle.

14:05.932 --> 14:08.282
This is none of your business.

14:09.457 --> 14:11.720
Back off!

14:11.763 --> 14:13.330
I mean it.

14:17.987 --> 14:18.988
[sighs]

14:25.603 --> 14:27.649
[indistinct chatter]

14:30.913 --> 14:32.697
Did you notice that lady
giving us the eyeball?

14:32.741 --> 14:34.569
Couple that was just in here
did it, too.

14:34.612 --> 14:36.353
Duh, you're
in the papers.

14:36.397 --> 14:38.573
Nobody reads papers anymore.Yeah, they do.

14:38.616 --> 14:41.010
You're NYPD's shero.

14:41.054 --> 14:42.316
Get used to it.

14:44.187 --> 14:45.928
Hey, Murray,
we'll take the check.

14:45.972 --> 14:47.364
Uh, no can do.

14:47.408 --> 14:49.192
Can't accept
a meal on the arm.

14:49.236 --> 14:51.020
No, sorry, but the last two
customers bought your lunches.

14:51.064 --> 14:54.197
[quietly chanting]:
Shero, shero.

14:54.241 --> 14:56.547
Feels too good to stop,
doesn't it?

14:56.591 --> 14:58.201
Excuse me?

14:58.245 --> 14:59.811
The outfits, the badges.

14:59.855 --> 15:01.988
You may have people fooled
but not me.

15:02.989 --> 15:04.207
What are you talking about?

15:04.251 --> 15:05.730
[scoffs] It's a setup.

15:05.774 --> 15:08.211
That phony shooter,
you fake cops...

15:08.255 --> 15:09.647
Sorry, are you
seriously saying...?

15:09.691 --> 15:10.997
They're being paid
by the government

15:11.040 --> 15:12.172
to keep you all scared.

15:12.215 --> 15:13.303
But it's crap!

15:13.347 --> 15:14.914
Nothing happened yesterday

15:14.957 --> 15:15.958
and they're liars!

15:16.002 --> 15:17.481
They're crisis actors!

15:17.525 --> 15:19.048
Hey, pal!
What are you doing?

15:19.092 --> 15:20.049
You need to calm down, sir.

15:20.093 --> 15:21.572
You can't shut me up!

15:21.616 --> 15:23.574
Nobody died yesterday!

15:23.618 --> 15:27.274
The only thing that died
was the truth, and I know it!

15:27.317 --> 15:29.450
[patrons screaming]

15:32.975 --> 15:34.324
WOMAN:
Watch out!

15:38.763 --> 15:40.417
"Crisis actors"?

15:40.461 --> 15:41.941
What?

15:50.297 --> 15:53.343
Next up, disciplinary
action on Officer Viviano.

15:54.997 --> 15:57.521
Brian Viviano out of the 6-4.

16:00.655 --> 16:03.571
Citizen filmed him
asleep in his patrol car.

16:03.614 --> 16:05.268
Viviano says
he has a seizure disorder--

16:05.312 --> 16:07.618
which, by never
reporting it,

16:07.662 --> 16:09.098
is an infraction all by itself.

16:09.142 --> 16:10.970
So, was he asleep
or having a seizure?

16:11.013 --> 16:12.580
He was asleep.

16:12.623 --> 16:13.973
He says the seizure disorder
makes him doze off.

16:14.016 --> 16:16.279
So, what, narcolepsy?Well, he says no.

16:16.323 --> 16:19.369
So the medication
is what made him sleepy.

16:19.413 --> 16:22.329
That-that gets into
medical privacy territory.

16:22.372 --> 16:24.374
Okay. Don't want to do that.

16:24.418 --> 16:26.115
Um, just find out

16:26.159 --> 16:27.899
if the guy was sleeping off
a hangover.

16:27.943 --> 16:28.900
GORMLEY:
Okay.

16:28.944 --> 16:30.902
That is the list for...

16:30.946 --> 16:32.643
One more thing.

16:34.906 --> 16:35.995
Um...

16:37.692 --> 16:39.650
I don't know whether
this is out of line or not.

16:39.694 --> 16:41.174
Frankly... [laughs]

16:41.217 --> 16:43.828
I'm a little embarrassed
about it, but...

16:43.872 --> 16:47.223
I was hoping you all could
share something with me.

16:55.927 --> 16:57.059
Shoot.

16:57.103 --> 16:58.843
Okay.

17:00.062 --> 17:04.240
How close were you to your dads
in their later years?

17:07.243 --> 17:08.331
Because?

17:08.375 --> 17:10.246
Can't say.

17:12.901 --> 17:15.425
Well, me and my old man
weren't that tight.

17:15.469 --> 17:17.732
Even till the day he died,

17:17.775 --> 17:20.561
I'd call and he'd be like,
"How's your money holding up?

17:20.604 --> 17:23.346
How's your car running?
Here's your mom."

17:23.390 --> 17:28.699
Like he didn't really want
to get into things with you?

17:28.743 --> 17:31.572
Uh, I knew he loved me,
in his way, you know.

17:31.615 --> 17:34.879
I took it as a sign of respect.

17:34.923 --> 17:36.794
Like, you know,
"I'm not gonna pry."

17:36.838 --> 17:39.101
I wish mine had some of that.

17:39.145 --> 17:42.104
I got the overly involved,
touchy-feely model,

17:42.148 --> 17:44.715
what's now called
helicopter parenting.

17:44.759 --> 17:46.804
Even today,

17:46.848 --> 17:48.763
he sends clippings
from the local paper,

17:48.806 --> 17:52.549
showing me how their
PD spokesman talks to the press.

17:52.593 --> 17:54.203
I was his princess.

17:54.247 --> 17:56.031
I could do no wrong,

17:56.075 --> 17:58.077
and even when I did do wrong,

17:58.120 --> 17:59.861
it was the fault
of the boyfriend

17:59.904 --> 18:02.124
or the crowd that I was with.

18:02.168 --> 18:03.821
That clears up a lot.

18:05.127 --> 18:07.782
Henry got a beef with you, boss?

18:10.959 --> 18:12.613
Good guess.

18:14.354 --> 18:16.138
I'm sorry to hear that.

18:16.182 --> 18:19.402
Oh, my dad needs
at least one beef a day.

18:19.446 --> 18:21.839
Makes him feel vital and alive.

18:21.883 --> 18:23.580
Being his roommate,

18:23.624 --> 18:25.452
that puts me
in the starting rotation.

18:25.495 --> 18:27.802
So wait it out till
he lands on the next one.

18:27.845 --> 18:30.239
Well, I would love to, but I...
[sighs]

18:30.283 --> 18:33.590
I-I think I got to push back
on this one.

18:33.634 --> 18:36.245
Tough spot any way you cut it.

18:36.289 --> 18:38.073
Yeah.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.119
Can I ask one more favor,

18:40.162 --> 18:42.121
between the three of you?

18:42.164 --> 18:44.819
Could you find out
the son of a bitch

18:44.862 --> 18:47.387
that rents that P.O. box?

18:54.698 --> 18:55.960
The really crazy part

18:56.004 --> 18:57.440
is you telling your
Dad to butt out.

18:57.484 --> 18:59.573
Oh, tell me about it.He hammer you?

18:59.616 --> 19:01.444
Kind of the opposite,
actually.

19:01.488 --> 19:04.143
Yeah, he-he got up,
took his beer,

19:04.186 --> 19:05.927
and went up to his room
for the rest of the night.

19:05.970 --> 19:09.017
Wow. I-I would have gotten
a ten-hour lecture.

19:09.060 --> 19:11.672
Then transferred
to military school.
[laughs]

19:11.715 --> 19:12.977
See?

19:13.021 --> 19:14.631
Whoever it was,
they forgot

19:14.675 --> 19:15.850
all about me.

19:15.893 --> 19:17.068
Good news.

19:17.112 --> 19:18.592
See you after
phys ed.

19:21.899 --> 19:24.859
Son of a bitch.

19:24.902 --> 19:27.427
Well, I appreciate
your honesty.

19:27.470 --> 19:29.472
Don't even bother.

19:29.516 --> 19:30.995
Killer has to be Gerald.

19:31.039 --> 19:32.562
Really?

19:32.606 --> 19:36.000
Yeah. Drug collars,
failed rehabs.

19:36.044 --> 19:38.481
He even broke into the apartment
next door to his old man

19:38.525 --> 19:40.222
a month ago,
looking for cash.

19:40.266 --> 19:42.529
Yeah, well,
Ted Jr.'s ex-girlfriend

19:42.572 --> 19:44.487
says he's a grade A creep.

19:44.531 --> 19:46.141
I mean, yes,
he's more successful,

19:46.185 --> 19:48.099
yes, his dad hired him
to work at his company,

19:48.143 --> 19:51.233
but he still has
a hell of a temper.

19:51.277 --> 19:53.453
A couple of months ago,
he assaulted a delivery guy

19:53.496 --> 19:55.411
for bringing
the wrong order.

19:55.455 --> 19:58.327
You suggesting they pulled some
kind of Menendez brothers move?

19:58.371 --> 20:00.068
No. They hate each other.

20:00.111 --> 20:02.201
Yeah, they do hate each other,
don't they?

20:02.244 --> 20:03.854
What?

20:03.898 --> 20:06.205
Never mind. Nothing.
It's a bad idea.

20:06.248 --> 20:08.685
And that's stopped you... when?

20:08.729 --> 20:10.252
[sighs] Okay.

20:10.296 --> 20:11.688
What if
we bring them down here

20:11.732 --> 20:13.037
and let them go
toe-to-toe again?

20:13.081 --> 20:15.344
And not tell 'em
the other one's here?

20:15.388 --> 20:18.782
Nah, we'll just light a fuse
and watch it burn.

20:25.398 --> 20:26.877
Hey. You ID'd

20:26.921 --> 20:28.488
our EDP?Prints on the front door

20:28.531 --> 20:30.054
says his name is
David Bowles.

20:30.098 --> 20:32.622
In the system because of a DWI
a few years back.

20:32.666 --> 20:35.234
So, do I collar him?

20:35.277 --> 20:37.453
It's the pizza guy that got cut.

20:37.497 --> 20:40.108
He said to follow your lead.

20:42.937 --> 20:45.809
No, he's just delusional.
Locking him up won't help.

20:45.853 --> 20:47.376
More delusional than you know.

20:47.420 --> 20:49.117
You change your mind, call me.

20:54.340 --> 20:56.167
JANKO:
Hey, Witten.

20:57.168 --> 20:58.474
You're not gonna believe this.

20:58.518 --> 20:59.910
You went down the
rabbit hole, too?

20:59.954 --> 21:01.956
What rabbit hole?Oh, on YouTube.

21:01.999 --> 21:03.697
I looked up "crisis actors."

21:03.740 --> 21:05.829
You won't believe the amount
of crazy that's out there.

21:05.873 --> 21:08.005
Our shooter, Sandy Hook,
Parkland.

21:08.049 --> 21:09.746
These conspiracy nuts are
convinced that it's all fake.

21:09.790 --> 21:13.837
Part of some psyops, false
flag government operation.

21:13.881 --> 21:15.622
Okay, well, it gets crazier.

21:15.665 --> 21:18.929
The guy who called us
crisis actors

21:18.973 --> 21:21.280
is the father
of the girl who died.

21:34.380 --> 21:36.251
I mean, me and Jamie
used to fight all the time,

21:36.295 --> 21:37.470
but never
like these two.

21:37.513 --> 21:38.862
They say it's because
of the old man,

21:38.906 --> 21:40.647
but...

21:40.690 --> 21:41.778
it's just an excuse.

21:41.822 --> 21:43.084
We didn't need
an excuse, did we?

21:43.127 --> 21:45.652
Nope. We used to fight
just for fun.

21:45.695 --> 21:46.696
You two fought for fun?

21:46.740 --> 21:48.045
JAMIE:
Well, yeah.

21:48.089 --> 21:49.612
Roughhousing, more like it,
but, you know,

21:49.656 --> 21:51.571
with fists and teeth.

21:51.614 --> 21:53.355
Hockey sticks.Yeah,

21:53.399 --> 21:55.531
and lawn darts.Ah.

21:55.575 --> 21:57.577
Wonder why it is that Jack
and I never fought like that.

21:57.620 --> 21:59.666
Excuse me, I babysat,

21:59.709 --> 22:01.624
and I distinctly
remember you and Jack

22:01.668 --> 22:03.887
jousting with
the fireplace tools

22:03.931 --> 22:05.976
and me having
to throw away a certain rug.

22:06.020 --> 22:08.022
DANNY:
Talking about the rug
that Linda said

22:08.065 --> 22:10.503
she threw away because
you spilled red wine on it?

22:10.546 --> 22:13.201
I did, after Sean's
head split open.

22:13.244 --> 22:15.203
[gasps]DANNY: What kind of babysitter
lets a kid's head

22:15.246 --> 22:17.510
get split open, doesn't even
tell the father about it?

22:17.553 --> 22:18.598
[soft laughter]SEAN:
We gave her

22:18.641 --> 22:21.427
our allowance to stay quiet.

22:21.470 --> 22:24.386
Oh, you bribed the babysitter?
That's a sweet move.

22:24.430 --> 22:25.779
Why am I not surprised?

22:25.822 --> 22:27.215
Dad used to just let us
battle it out,

22:27.258 --> 22:28.390
and then Joe would
take on the winner.

22:28.434 --> 22:29.870
Whoa, wait. Dad encouraged it.

22:29.913 --> 22:31.437
He was the referee.

22:31.480 --> 22:33.308
Guess you were lucky Dad
didn't have any other siblings

22:33.352 --> 22:35.963
so you didn't have to break up
all these fights, huh, Pop?

22:36.920 --> 22:38.444
Lucky with him?

22:39.445 --> 22:41.447
Not the word I'd use.

22:43.753 --> 22:46.539
Blessed, that's the word.Ha.

22:46.582 --> 22:49.455
But sometimes
too stubborn to see it.

22:52.066 --> 22:55.156
Anyone else need a sweater
for the cold chill

22:55.199 --> 22:57.071
between these two?Right here.

22:57.114 --> 22:57.898
We're fine.

22:57.941 --> 22:59.247
The hell we are.

22:59.290 --> 23:01.728
Or we will be.

23:01.771 --> 23:04.644
You guys want to tell us
what's going on?

23:04.687 --> 23:06.123
HENRY:
Ask him,

23:06.167 --> 23:08.648
and if he says,
"Mind your own business,"

23:08.691 --> 23:10.998
ask him again
and again and again.

23:11.041 --> 23:13.174
Pop, that is not
exactly how it went.

23:13.217 --> 23:16.830
That is exactly how it went.

23:17.918 --> 23:19.267
Something you two
want to talk about?

23:19.310 --> 23:20.268
I'm fine.

23:20.311 --> 23:21.269
I'm fine.

23:21.312 --> 23:22.531
Apparently, it's all fine.

23:22.575 --> 23:23.706
It seems fine.

23:36.850 --> 23:38.417
You gonna do this all night?

23:39.548 --> 23:43.944
Actually, I'm
almost finished.

23:46.990 --> 23:49.776
Pop, I am truly sorry.

23:49.819 --> 23:51.125
I didn't mean to pry.

23:51.168 --> 23:53.257
Actions speak louder than words.

23:54.824 --> 23:56.391
Alex Van Helt.

23:59.002 --> 24:01.483
Reactions speak louder
than words.

24:01.527 --> 24:02.876
Your point?

24:02.919 --> 24:05.008
Well, I don't get it.

24:05.052 --> 24:06.836
The department said
it was a good shoot.

24:06.880 --> 24:09.012
So, case closed, then and now.

24:09.056 --> 24:11.058
Except for what?

24:12.886 --> 24:17.847
Except that to this day,
I don't know if it was true.

24:17.891 --> 24:20.459
My partner saw a gun.

24:22.417 --> 24:24.071
They never found it.

24:25.551 --> 24:27.509
And you doubt
your partner's word?

24:27.553 --> 24:30.817
No. He thought Van Helt
had a gun,

24:30.860 --> 24:33.646
but I was the one
who initiated the stop.

24:33.689 --> 24:36.823
And from that,
I put a guy into a wheelchair

24:36.866 --> 24:39.086
for the rest of his life.

24:43.264 --> 24:46.223
Pop...

24:46.267 --> 24:49.749
you do know that Van Helt died
nine years ago, don't you?

24:49.792 --> 24:53.492
Someone keeps opening
that P.O. box.

24:55.798 --> 24:57.931
His wife, his kids.

24:57.974 --> 25:00.107
I don't know.

25:00.150 --> 25:02.196
Someone who needs money.

25:06.592 --> 25:08.855
And if it gets out
that the former PC

25:08.898 --> 25:11.118
is giving cash to the victim

25:11.161 --> 25:14.600
of what he considers
a questionable shooting?

25:14.643 --> 25:17.472
It will never get out.

25:18.908 --> 25:20.693
I hope you're right.

25:20.736 --> 25:23.391
And don't wind me up with that

25:23.434 --> 25:27.308
"This will reflect badly
on the department" crap.

25:27.351 --> 25:29.136
I won't.

25:29.179 --> 25:31.965
Lucky for you
if you're one of the few

25:32.008 --> 25:34.445
that don't carry any regrets.

25:34.489 --> 25:37.318
That's not true. Of course I do.

25:38.319 --> 25:40.103
Yeah, but if you do,

25:40.147 --> 25:42.932
you can put them into a box.

25:42.976 --> 25:45.456
You're good at that. I'm not.

25:49.330 --> 25:51.898
I'm not good at it.

25:51.941 --> 25:53.987
I just do it.

26:02.125 --> 26:04.475
I've already answered
your questions, Detective.

26:04.519 --> 26:07.261
I know, but our investigating
has led to some more questions

26:07.304 --> 26:08.654
that we need answering.Right this way.

26:10.307 --> 26:11.613
BOTH: What is he doing here?Whoa.

26:11.657 --> 26:12.658
Sorry, I didn't realize

26:12.701 --> 26:14.921
you two were in here.

26:14.964 --> 26:16.531
No, no problem at all. Uh...

26:16.575 --> 26:17.619
Why don't you sit down,
we'll make it a party?

26:17.663 --> 26:18.794
No, not with this loser.

26:18.838 --> 26:20.274
Oh, and you're such a winner?

26:20.317 --> 26:22.406
Okay, time-out.
Look, you, sit down.

26:22.450 --> 26:24.539
Let's talk.

26:26.802 --> 26:28.543
[sighs]

26:30.719 --> 26:32.895
I'll tell you what we can do.

26:32.939 --> 26:34.593
You two hash it out,

26:34.636 --> 26:36.029
and whoever
can convince us

26:36.072 --> 26:37.944
that they didn't do it can walk.

26:37.987 --> 26:39.032
How about that?

26:39.075 --> 26:40.381
I want my attorney.

26:40.424 --> 26:41.338
Yeah, same here.

26:41.382 --> 26:43.340
[clears throat]

26:44.515 --> 26:46.735
How about you write
some numbers down,

26:46.779 --> 26:48.389
and we'll give them a call?

26:48.432 --> 26:50.086
Yeah. I mean, it's probably
gonna take a while,

26:50.130 --> 26:51.653
but we'll wait.

26:51.697 --> 26:53.133
And in the meantime,
I sit in here with him?

26:53.176 --> 26:54.961
He killed my dad!

26:55.004 --> 26:56.658
He was my dad, too.

26:56.702 --> 26:58.921
At least get one thing right
for once in your life.

26:58.965 --> 27:00.967
He was our father.

27:01.010 --> 27:02.316
Oh, what are you gonna do,
cry now?

27:02.359 --> 27:03.665
You know,
you've spent your whole life

27:03.709 --> 27:04.971
acting like me and my mom
didn't exist.

27:05.014 --> 27:07.582
Oh, I knew damn well
you existed.

27:07.626 --> 27:08.888
How could I not?

27:08.931 --> 27:10.498
Everything was
"Poor Gerald this,

27:10.541 --> 27:12.326
poor Gerald that."
It's like I've had

27:12.369 --> 27:14.807
a sickly five-year-old brother
I never wanted.

27:14.850 --> 27:16.547
What kind of a dick
deletes a guy's number

27:16.591 --> 27:18.201
from his own father's phone?

27:18.245 --> 27:19.768
They sound a lot like my kids.

27:20.682 --> 27:22.510
What are you talking about?
I never deleted your number.

27:22.553 --> 27:23.816
How come he never
answered my texts?

27:23.859 --> 27:25.121
He texted with you constantly.

27:25.165 --> 27:26.166
Every time I was
with him last year,

27:26.209 --> 27:28.168
it was, "Bing, bing, bing."

27:28.211 --> 27:30.431
No, no, that's what happened
when you knew he was with me.

27:30.474 --> 27:32.520
Hey, wait-wait a minute.
Time-out.

27:33.782 --> 27:36.829
Did either of you
actually see the texts

27:36.872 --> 27:38.700
or who he was texting with?

27:39.875 --> 27:40.746
No.

27:40.789 --> 27:42.269
No, but who else would Dad

27:42.312 --> 27:44.010
have been texting with?

27:44.053 --> 27:46.316
I mean, guys his age
only text with his kids.

27:46.360 --> 27:48.057
Otherwise they talk
on the phone.

27:48.101 --> 27:50.625
That's actually a good question.

27:50.669 --> 27:52.714
I have his phone
sitting in an evidence bag.

27:52.758 --> 27:54.716
I was about to take it
down to CCS

27:54.760 --> 27:56.152
and have them go through it.

27:56.196 --> 27:58.938
Yeah, why don't we save them
the trouble?

28:01.418 --> 28:03.725
I just don't think
this is a good idea.

28:03.769 --> 28:05.727
I just want to talk to him.

28:05.771 --> 28:07.337
[sighs]
The guy lost his daughter.

28:07.381 --> 28:08.687
Hasn't he suffered enough?

28:08.730 --> 28:10.558
By disrespecting
his daughter's death?

28:10.601 --> 28:12.212
Disrespecting what I had to do?

28:12.255 --> 28:13.779
Rachel, I know it's crazy,

28:13.822 --> 28:15.563
e-especially him saying
that we were complicit

28:15.606 --> 28:18.000
in some big lie, but he doesn't
actually believe it.

28:18.044 --> 28:19.654
Says who?

28:19.698 --> 28:22.135
I talked to the cops who
did the next of kin notification

28:22.178 --> 28:26.139
and they said that Mr. Bowles
totally melted down.

28:26.182 --> 28:28.271
He screamed that Alyssa
couldn't be dead,

28:28.315 --> 28:31.492
that she'd been in Montauk
the weekend before

28:31.535 --> 28:33.059
and that she just hadn't
come home yet.

28:33.102 --> 28:34.756
Okay.

28:34.800 --> 28:36.845
And then I went online and I saw
those conspiracy trolls

28:36.889 --> 28:40.806
bragging about
how they'd found his number.

28:40.849 --> 28:44.592
They started bombarding him
with all that psyop crap.

28:44.635 --> 28:47.116
They-they went
after the victim's dad?

28:47.160 --> 28:48.944
It's what they do.

28:48.988 --> 28:51.686
They find someone vulnerable
and they pounce.

28:51.730 --> 28:55.081
And he believed it because...

28:55.124 --> 28:57.257
Facing the truth
about his daughter's death

28:57.300 --> 28:58.998
would completely destroy him.

29:17.146 --> 29:19.192
What do we do now?

29:23.849 --> 29:25.111
Ms. Wilson.

29:25.154 --> 29:26.939
Yes?

29:26.982 --> 29:29.637
Hi, I've never had your class,
but my name is Sean...

29:29.680 --> 29:32.466
Sean Reagan. I know who you are.

29:32.509 --> 29:35.077
I know you're not exactly
the biggest fan of my family.

29:36.209 --> 29:38.124
Is there a question here, Sean?

29:38.167 --> 29:41.823
Someone wrote "ACAB"
all over my locker.

29:41.867 --> 29:43.869
So I heard.
How?

29:43.912 --> 29:45.871
It's a high school.

29:45.914 --> 29:47.873
Where the main office

29:47.916 --> 29:50.223
has everyone's
locker combinations on file.

29:50.266 --> 29:51.964
And I imagine

29:52.007 --> 29:53.661
that the teachers
would have access.

29:53.704 --> 29:54.880
Excuse me?

29:55.924 --> 29:58.144
You know what ACAB means, right?

29:58.187 --> 30:00.189
All cops are bastards.

30:00.233 --> 30:02.322
Which you agree with, right?

30:02.365 --> 30:04.150
You're putting words
in my mouth.

30:04.193 --> 30:06.761
They're your words.
It's what you teach.

30:07.762 --> 30:09.242
Used to teach.

30:10.460 --> 30:12.245
Last summer,

30:12.288 --> 30:15.726
looting broke out
in my neighborhood.

30:15.770 --> 30:20.166
First I thought, "Yes, oh,
the revolution is finally here."

30:20.209 --> 30:21.732
And then they...

30:23.386 --> 30:25.519
They weren't protesters.

30:25.562 --> 30:28.783
I know what a protest
looks like.

30:28.827 --> 30:31.786
They started torching
the cars on my block.

30:31.830 --> 30:34.876
And I watched the cops put
their lives on the line

30:34.920 --> 30:37.009
to stop the violence.

30:38.967 --> 30:41.230
I-I'm not saying
they're all angels...

30:41.274 --> 30:42.884
But they're not all
the devil either.

30:42.928 --> 30:45.191
Not that night, not on my block.

30:45.234 --> 30:47.019
Sean,

30:47.062 --> 30:49.369
it wasn't me who wrote that.

30:49.412 --> 30:51.023
But someone did.

30:51.066 --> 30:53.808
And somehow they got
my locker combination.

30:53.852 --> 30:56.724
Any friends hang out
while you open your locker?

30:56.767 --> 30:59.031
Why do you ask that?

30:59.074 --> 31:00.989
In case you haven't noticed,
Sean,

31:01.033 --> 31:03.513
the world's turned upside down.

31:10.607 --> 31:13.132
[indistinct chatter]

31:15.482 --> 31:16.787
Hello, ladies.

31:16.831 --> 31:19.312
Hey, Sean.

31:22.968 --> 31:24.839
[chatter continues]

31:29.888 --> 31:32.412
Where is she?There she is.

31:32.455 --> 31:34.936
I hope you found out
who killed Mr. Bradley.

31:34.980 --> 31:37.460
We did, it just took a while.
Hands behind your back.

31:37.504 --> 31:39.593
What?We're making a withdrawal.

31:39.636 --> 31:41.464
And you're it.

31:41.508 --> 31:43.249
What are you talking about?

31:43.292 --> 31:45.599
Gaslighting an old man
that his kids were out

31:45.642 --> 31:47.427
to drain his accounts
so he better start

31:47.470 --> 31:49.168
hoarding large chunks
of cash at home?

31:49.211 --> 31:50.865
Then he takes a hundred
grand out of the bank,

31:50.909 --> 31:53.563
you follow him home
and pay him a surprise visit.

31:53.607 --> 31:55.478
No, I-I didn't do that.

31:55.522 --> 31:57.263
No, they're lying.Nobody's lying

31:57.306 --> 31:58.655
except you, okay?

31:58.699 --> 32:00.396
We saw the app
you had him download,

32:00.440 --> 32:02.703
we read all the text messages
between you guys.

32:02.746 --> 32:04.009
What do you say, partner?

32:04.052 --> 32:05.967
Jury takes about an hour
to convict?

32:06.011 --> 32:08.274
I give 'em 30 minutes.
Let's go.

32:08.317 --> 32:11.451
You know, I was the only
good person in his life.

32:11.494 --> 32:13.322
He would have wanted me
to have that money!

32:13.366 --> 32:15.063
You're probably right.

32:15.107 --> 32:17.196
I don't deserve this!

32:17.239 --> 32:19.067
And he didn't deserve
a knife in the back.

32:23.854 --> 32:26.988
Hey, were you in Montauk?
Did you see this girl there?

32:27.032 --> 32:28.555
Hey, excuse me, excuse me.

32:28.598 --> 32:30.209
My daughter was supposed
to come home last week,

32:30.252 --> 32:31.993
but she must've missed her bus.
Have you seen her?

32:32.037 --> 32:34.082
No. Sorry, sir.H-Have you seen
this girl before?

32:34.126 --> 32:35.214
No, sorry.She was in Montauk last week.

32:35.257 --> 32:36.737
He's been showing up every day.

32:36.780 --> 32:38.913
I told him to leave, but
he keeps coming back.

32:38.957 --> 32:40.480
He's in a bad place.

32:40.523 --> 32:42.003
But you'll arrest him, right?

32:42.047 --> 32:43.787
Sir?I mean, he's harassing people.

Don't worry,

BOWLES:
She's my daughter. She was
supposed to be home last week.

32:48.096 --> 32:49.402
No?
No.

32:49.445 --> 32:50.403
Thank you.

32:50.446 --> 32:52.535
Excuse me, have...? Oh.

32:52.579 --> 32:53.928
It's you two.

32:53.972 --> 32:55.147
Mr. Bowles,
we're here to help you.

32:55.190 --> 32:56.626
How?

32:56.670 --> 32:58.672
By disappearing me
because I'm on to you?

32:59.847 --> 33:02.458
They're imposters. If anything
happens to me, they did it.

33:02.502 --> 33:05.331
Look, Alyssa is not coming
off of one of these buses.

33:05.374 --> 33:06.332
Yes, she is.

33:06.375 --> 33:07.376
No, she isn't.

33:07.420 --> 33:08.377
She got back last week,

33:08.421 --> 33:09.552
just like she planned,

33:09.596 --> 33:11.424
and then she went to her job

33:11.467 --> 33:13.339
the very next day.

33:13.382 --> 33:14.818
Why do you keep lying?

33:14.862 --> 33:17.169
We were there.
We tried to help her.

33:17.212 --> 33:20.085
My daughter just isn't back
from her weekend trip.

33:20.128 --> 33:22.522
When she gets back,
I'm gonna find her.

33:22.565 --> 33:24.741
We've had some
problems lately.

33:24.785 --> 33:27.875

33:27.918 --> 33:31.835
You-you can't let those be
your last words.

33:33.011 --> 33:34.403
That's why I have to find her.

33:34.447 --> 33:36.275
And we know where she is.

33:36.318 --> 33:39.278
Yeah, come on.

33:39.321 --> 33:40.888
We'll take you there.

33:45.675 --> 33:48.417
So the lady at the bank
killed him?

33:48.461 --> 33:50.115
Yes. She confessed to it.

33:50.158 --> 33:51.725
After throwing a
tantrum, of course.

33:51.768 --> 33:53.683
I can't believe it.Yeah, 'cause you were

33:53.727 --> 33:55.120
too busy blaming me.

33:55.163 --> 33:56.425
Same thing you
were doing to me.

33:56.469 --> 33:58.340
Listen, you-you stuck-up
son of a bitch.

33:58.384 --> 34:00.951
All right.
Can you two just stop, please?

34:00.995 --> 34:02.127
All right?

34:02.170 --> 34:03.824
He didn't do it
and he didn't do it.

34:03.867 --> 34:05.478
End of discussion.

34:05.521 --> 34:07.175
Seriously, look,
I didn't know your old man.

34:07.219 --> 34:09.525
Okay? But I know fathers,
I know sons, I know families.

34:09.569 --> 34:10.918
Now, if you're gonna take

34:10.961 --> 34:12.659
any positive out of this,
take away

34:12.702 --> 34:14.704
the fact that you're family.

34:14.748 --> 34:16.967
Okay, you're all you got now,
for better or worse,

34:17.011 --> 34:18.447

34:21.407 --> 34:22.669
Really? Alcohol?

34:22.712 --> 34:23.496
Forget it.

34:23.539 --> 34:24.758
Just say yes.

34:24.801 --> 34:26.412
Come on, your problems

34:26.455 --> 34:28.153
are bigger than
his drinking problem.

34:28.196 --> 34:29.806
No offense.

34:29.850 --> 34:32.853
How about O'Keefe's?

34:32.896 --> 34:34.681
It's the first place
Dad ever bought me one.

34:34.724 --> 34:38.076
Yeah. Me, too.
Booth in the back.

34:38.119 --> 34:39.773

All right, knock yourselves out.

34:45.344 --> 34:47.563
But not with your fists.

34:51.132 --> 34:53.221

for me to walk home?

34:54.483 --> 34:56.572

by me in the hall.

34:56.616 --> 34:58.531

against my friends?

34:58.574 --> 35:02.883
Yeah, the one with "ACAB"
written on her notebook.

35:04.798 --> 35:06.278
Corrine?

35:06.321 --> 35:08.715
Why'd you give her
my locker combo?

35:08.758 --> 35:09.890
I didn't.

35:09.933 --> 35:11.283
Principal will figure it out.

35:11.326 --> 35:12.762
You're going to the principal?
