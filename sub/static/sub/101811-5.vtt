WEBVTT

00:16.016 --> 00:18.627
MELISSA:
And the e-file authorization,
sign and date.

00:19.845 --> 00:22.370
See? Virtually painless.

00:22.413 --> 00:24.067
Same thing your
mom always said.

00:24.111 --> 00:25.373
She also used to say
that your dad and you

00:25.416 --> 00:27.375
were her favorite clients.

00:27.418 --> 00:29.986
None of that "procrastinating
till April 14th" crap.

00:36.123 --> 00:37.733
Those are mine.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.216
Okay.

00:43.173 --> 00:44.870
Till next year, then.

00:46.524 --> 00:49.136
I'm not sure
you should wait till then.

00:49.179 --> 00:50.833
Wait for what?

00:50.876 --> 00:53.966
Whatever the bad news is.

00:59.276 --> 01:01.757
When I was studying to be a CPA,

01:01.800 --> 01:03.933
my mom would always take me
to client meetings,

01:03.976 --> 01:05.848
get the feel for it.

01:08.764 --> 01:11.636
I always used to get the willies
coming to yours.

01:12.811 --> 01:14.857
Why?

01:14.900 --> 01:17.686
I was always like,
"Do I have a joint in my bag

01:17.729 --> 01:19.688
"or an unpaid ticket
in the glove box?

01:19.731 --> 01:21.429
Because he'll know."

01:23.387 --> 01:27.087
Okay. Full immunity.

01:30.742 --> 01:33.528
Melissa, it's pretty hard
to get off the 14th floor

01:33.571 --> 01:35.486
without my say-so.

01:36.444 --> 01:38.750
[exhales]

01:41.579 --> 01:44.060
When my mom passed away,
I went through all the files

01:44.104 --> 01:46.758
to get up to speed
with my new clients,

01:46.802 --> 01:49.109
including your father's.

01:51.589 --> 01:53.243
Okay.

01:53.287 --> 01:57.378
He had her making
monthly payments to someone.

01:57.421 --> 01:59.467
Her files only go back

01:59.510 --> 02:02.644
12 years, but I get the feeling
it's been even longer than that.

02:03.601 --> 02:06.387
Any notation in her accounting?

02:06.430 --> 02:08.650
Uh, no charitable deductions,
no nothing.

02:10.608 --> 02:13.002
Just cash disbursements.

02:14.960 --> 02:17.006
Only cash?

02:17.049 --> 02:19.878
[sighs]

02:27.451 --> 02:30.193
Thanks.

02:30.237 --> 02:31.890
Nice place.

02:31.934 --> 02:33.153
Yeah, unfortunately, this'll
probably go on the market

02:33.196 --> 02:34.284
if we're here.

02:34.328 --> 02:36.417
What do you got?Ted Bradley, 58.

02:36.460 --> 02:38.767
Runs a big ad agency
that comes up with names

02:38.810 --> 02:40.247
for new pharmaceuticals.

02:40.290 --> 02:43.946
Lipetra, Thunderlax,
whatever those things are.

02:43.989 --> 02:47.210
Downstairs neighbors heard a
commotion and they called it in.

02:47.254 --> 02:49.169
Well, that'll get the job done.

02:51.519 --> 02:53.260
BAEZ:
And a wallet and
a Rolex Daytona

02:53.303 --> 02:54.913
just out here in the open?

02:54.957 --> 02:57.133
I'm not feeling
this is a robbery.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.483
Maybe the perp didn't want
to take anything traceable.

02:59.527 --> 03:01.050
[sighs]

03:04.532 --> 03:07.622
$10,000 currency band,

03:07.665 --> 03:09.276
minus the currency.

03:09.319 --> 03:11.016
Guess that's not traceable.

03:11.060 --> 03:12.540
TED JR.: Get your hands off me!MEYERS: Hey, hey, hey...

03:12.583 --> 03:14.106
This is a crime scene.
You cannot enter.

03:14.150 --> 03:16.196
MEYERS:
Okay? Hey!
Knock it off now!

03:16.239 --> 03:18.110
GERALD: This is my family home!TED JR.: Oh, the hell it is.

03:18.154 --> 03:19.416
GERALD: What are
you talking about?Hey, hey!

03:19.460 --> 03:20.983
Who the hell are you two?

03:21.026 --> 03:23.159
I-I'm Ted Bradley's son.So am I.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.640
Well, first things first.
What brought you two here?

03:25.683 --> 03:26.902
I couldn't reach him.

03:26.945 --> 03:27.990
He and I were
supposed to have lunch.

03:28.033 --> 03:29.165
What's going on?

03:29.209 --> 03:31.254
He's dead.

03:31.298 --> 03:32.473
What?

03:32.516 --> 03:33.648
Oh, my God.

03:33.691 --> 03:34.997
We're very sorry.

03:35.040 --> 03:36.781
You thought
he cut you off again,

03:36.825 --> 03:38.218
so you killed him.What? No.

03:38.261 --> 03:39.480
Please.
No. There--

03:39.523 --> 03:41.090
This is your guy right here.

03:41.133 --> 03:43.092
Whoa, whoa. Hey!

03:44.049 --> 03:44.920
Come on.

03:46.356 --> 03:49.359
[muttering]

03:49.403 --> 03:51.448
Get them out of here. Come on.

03:54.234 --> 03:57.498
Ugh. This homework
is gonna kill me.

03:57.541 --> 03:59.239
"Foldable cell membrane"?

03:59.282 --> 04:01.328
Are you kidding?It's so boring.

04:01.371 --> 04:02.677
No, I was actually
kind of hoping

04:02.720 --> 04:04.069
that you would explain it
to me.

04:04.113 --> 04:06.071
[laughs]
Shut up, you're smart.

04:06.115 --> 04:11.163
So maybe we could hang out
later and you could help me?

04:11.207 --> 04:14.123
SEAN:
Son of a bitch.

04:14.166 --> 04:15.342
What does "ACAB" mean?

04:15.385 --> 04:17.561
"All cops are bastards."Seriously?

04:17.605 --> 04:19.650
Yeah, it's-it's a thing.

04:20.738 --> 04:22.523
[sighs]

04:22.566 --> 04:25.787
Maybe the janitor has something
that'll clean it off.

04:28.093 --> 04:31.009
Did he sleep over?Yeah, but on the couch.

04:31.053 --> 04:33.316
You got more self-control
than me.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.840
I might have spent a little
time on the couch with him.

04:35.884 --> 04:37.015
Hmm.

04:37.059 --> 04:39.366
And on the coffee table.

04:39.409 --> 04:40.889
Let me see that again.[laughs]: Excuse me?

04:40.932 --> 04:42.456
You're happily married.

04:42.499 --> 04:43.718
You can look at the menu
even though

04:43.761 --> 04:44.719
you've already ordered,
you know.

04:44.762 --> 04:46.764
Uh-huh.[gunshots]

04:48.026 --> 04:50.072
It's over there.

04:50.115 --> 04:54.468
10-13. We got shots fired
at 2904 2nd Avenue.

04:54.511 --> 04:56.034
Possible active shooter.

04:56.078 --> 04:58.254
Send a bus
and additional units forthwith.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.996
DISPATCHER:
Copy, U29-Charlie.

05:02.693 --> 05:04.652
Yeah. We're going in, Central.

05:12.399 --> 05:13.487
He came back.

05:13.530 --> 05:14.618
Who did?

05:14.662 --> 05:16.098
He got fired,

05:16.141 --> 05:18.666
but he came back.Okay.

05:20.450 --> 05:21.582
Keep pressure on this.

05:21.625 --> 05:23.192
[glass shatters in distance]

05:27.152 --> 05:30.417
MAN:
I get what I'm owed
or all of you die!

05:30.460 --> 05:32.593
Do you hear me? Pay me my money!

05:32.636 --> 05:34.421
Jerry, we paid you. We...

05:34.464 --> 05:36.553
Police! Don't move!

05:40.340 --> 05:42.254
[whispers]:
Okay. Okay.Yeah.

06:07.671 --> 06:09.369
[panting]

06:14.722 --> 06:16.027
[shouts]

06:19.204 --> 06:20.467
[both panting]

06:22.469 --> 06:24.645
You okay?Yeah.

06:25.863 --> 06:27.082
Is he dead?

06:31.173 --> 06:32.392
Yeah.

06:39.964 --> 06:43.098
â™ª

07:01.159 --> 07:02.813
I'm Ted's real son.

07:02.857 --> 07:04.380
Then that dick's mom over there
broke up our family.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.687
Well, he says your dad
cut you off.

07:06.730 --> 07:08.210
Because he convinced him to.

07:08.253 --> 07:10.473
Look, my Dad would buy
whatever he was selling.

07:10.517 --> 07:13.694
Uh, his family was screwed up
way before my parents met.

07:13.737 --> 07:15.391
His mom was a total alcoholic.

07:15.435 --> 07:18.481
Well, if he hates yours,
why kill his dad and not her?

07:18.525 --> 07:22.137
She died last year.
Uterine cancer.

07:23.486 --> 07:25.662
[scoffs]
And you know what he did?

07:25.706 --> 07:27.925
He called me on the phone
and laughed.

07:27.969 --> 07:30.450
It's called karma.
Same way he says it's only right

07:30.493 --> 07:32.060
he got named Junior.

07:32.103 --> 07:33.714
I mean, look at him over there.

07:33.757 --> 07:35.150
He's so smug.

07:35.193 --> 07:36.412
And you think,
since you were firstborn,

07:36.456 --> 07:37.892
that you should've gotten that?

07:37.935 --> 07:39.589
And yet I got nothing.

07:39.633 --> 07:41.243
Dad gave Gerald everything.

07:41.286 --> 07:45.029
Time and money,
and it went right up his nose

07:45.073 --> 07:47.162
or into his arm.

07:47.205 --> 07:49.425
Every chance he had in life,
he blew.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.253
So you think he killed
your father for the money?

07:51.296 --> 07:56.301
He'd gotten it into his head
he'd been cut out of the will.

07:56.345 --> 08:00.131
Must've snapped.

08:00.175 --> 08:04.135
I've made some mistakes,
but I loved my father.

08:04.179 --> 08:05.528
Do you have any idea why

08:05.572 --> 08:06.616
he might've had
so much cash on him?

08:06.660 --> 08:08.139
Ask Junior.

08:08.183 --> 08:09.619
He'd be the one
who put him up to it.

08:09.663 --> 08:12.100
I'll do that.

08:19.542 --> 08:23.154
The guy must've shot her first
thing he walked in the door.

08:25.722 --> 08:27.245
Let's get you checked out, okay?

08:27.289 --> 08:29.726
Let's go.
Why? I'm fine.

08:29.770 --> 08:32.555
Eddie, I did what I had to do.

08:32.599 --> 08:34.383
What we trained to do.

08:34.426 --> 08:35.776
[sighs]

08:37.865 --> 08:39.388
Which one of you took him out?

08:39.431 --> 08:40.737
Uh, she did.

08:41.695 --> 08:44.915
Thank you for saving us.

08:55.839 --> 08:57.406
Attagirl.

09:10.593 --> 09:11.768
[grunts]

09:13.422 --> 09:14.858
Mr. Bradley is dead?

09:14.902 --> 09:16.033
DANNY:
Yes.

09:16.077 --> 09:17.861
Did you know him well?

09:17.905 --> 09:20.211
Well, only in that I've been his
banker for the last few years.

09:20.255 --> 09:22.300
Well, is there anything
you can tell us about him?

09:22.344 --> 09:24.564
Oh, he was a sweet guy,
very old-fashioned.

09:24.607 --> 09:26.609
You know, didn't like ATMs.

09:26.653 --> 09:28.393
Liked the interaction
with real people.

09:28.437 --> 09:30.744
Did he make
any large withdrawals recently?

09:30.787 --> 09:32.484
Yes. He came in yesterday.

09:32.528 --> 09:34.399
He said he needed
a hundred thousand.

09:34.443 --> 09:37.751
So I suggested a cashier's
check, but he wanted cash.

09:37.794 --> 09:39.883
You know, he wouldn't
even let our guard

09:39.927 --> 09:41.711
deliver it to his house.

09:41.755 --> 09:44.627
We'll need to see
your security camera footage.Sure.

09:44.671 --> 09:47.412
Uh, he show any signs
of depression lately?

09:47.456 --> 09:48.588
You see any of that?

09:48.631 --> 09:50.067
Oh, I don't know.

09:50.111 --> 09:52.896
It was just
a retail relationship, but...

09:52.940 --> 09:53.984
But?

09:54.942 --> 09:56.944
His wife passed away last year.

09:56.987 --> 09:58.815
And have you met
those two sons of his?

09:59.860 --> 10:01.775
Did they bank here, also?

10:01.818 --> 10:03.341
Oh, they're in every other week.

10:03.385 --> 10:05.474
One will come in
with Mr. Bradley to add his name

10:05.517 --> 10:08.259
to his dad's accounts
or change his PIN,

10:08.303 --> 10:10.087
and then the other shows up
to change it back.

10:10.131 --> 10:12.133
Then everyone just starts
yelling and screaming.

10:12.176 --> 10:14.265
Did it ever get physical?

10:14.309 --> 10:16.441
Uh, only verbal,
but they'd even go after him.

10:16.485 --> 10:18.095
You know,
"You're a terrible dad,

10:18.139 --> 10:19.749
you love him more than me,"
et cetera, et cetera.

10:19.793 --> 10:21.664
That's why I tried
to be sweet to him.

10:21.708 --> 10:23.318
Mm-hmm.

10:23.361 --> 10:24.972
Did either one of them seem
capable of hurting him

10:25.015 --> 10:26.147
or murder?

10:26.190 --> 10:27.148
[exhales]

10:27.191 --> 10:28.758
I just work in a bank.

10:28.802 --> 10:30.499
Right,
but you've seen them interact

10:30.542 --> 10:32.109
and it hasn't always
been pleasant.

10:32.153 --> 10:34.459
He was a good man

10:34.503 --> 10:36.940
with two ungrateful brats
for children.

10:36.984 --> 10:39.116
That's all I know.

10:39.160 --> 10:41.292
Well, thank you for your help.

10:41.336 --> 10:43.077
Mm.[phone ringing and buzzing]

10:43.120 --> 10:45.296
Not that she was much help.

10:45.340 --> 10:47.647
Well, she tried.

10:47.690 --> 10:49.170
Reagan.

10:49.213 --> 10:51.215
Yeah, Sean's dad.

10:53.478 --> 10:55.611
They wrote what?

10:59.397 --> 11:01.791
What you doing?Studying.

11:01.835 --> 11:03.401
Studying, huh?

11:03.445 --> 11:05.012
Mm-hmm.

11:05.055 --> 11:06.187
What you studying?

11:06.230 --> 11:07.928
Chemistry.

11:07.971 --> 11:09.407
Chemistry.

11:11.496 --> 11:12.846
What you hiding?

11:12.889 --> 11:14.978
Nothing.

11:15.022 --> 11:16.937
[exhales]

11:16.980 --> 11:18.416
Nothing?

11:22.377 --> 11:23.421
How'd you find out?

11:23.465 --> 11:24.814
Janitor told the principal,

11:24.858 --> 11:26.337
principal called me.

11:26.381 --> 11:27.774
Principal also let me know

11:27.817 --> 11:29.427
that you not reporting
bullying

11:29.471 --> 11:31.299
is just as big a violation
of the honor code

11:31.342 --> 11:32.822
as the bullying itself.

11:32.866 --> 11:34.215
So now I'm in trouble?

11:34.258 --> 11:35.390
I didn't say that.
I spoke to the principal.

11:35.433 --> 11:36.913
You're not in trouble.

11:36.957 --> 11:38.262
It's no big deal.

11:38.306 --> 11:39.350
All your family members

11:39.394 --> 11:40.787
being referred to as "bastard"

11:40.830 --> 11:41.918
is not a big deal to you?

11:41.962 --> 11:43.311
I don't take the bait,

11:43.354 --> 11:44.704
they don't get what they want,

11:44.747 --> 11:45.879
and they just move on.

11:45.922 --> 11:47.794
Look...

11:47.837 --> 11:50.013
are you sure
this is just some kid

11:50.057 --> 11:51.058
who's a troll?

11:51.101 --> 11:52.407
Who else would it be?

11:53.538 --> 11:55.845
You remember that woman,
the social studies teacher

11:55.889 --> 11:57.368
who went after Nicky
a few years ago?

11:57.412 --> 11:58.543
A teacher?

11:58.587 --> 11:59.675
The certified cop hater

11:59.719 --> 12:01.285
who was a cop hater long before

12:01.329 --> 12:02.722
it became everyone's
favorite hobby to hate cops?

12:02.765 --> 12:04.027
That one?

12:04.071 --> 12:06.073
[sighs]

12:07.074 --> 12:09.554
Do me a favor and don't say
nothing to her, okay?

12:09.598 --> 12:11.382
Dad, no.

12:11.426 --> 12:12.949
Just gonna suss her out,
that's all.

12:12.993 --> 12:13.907
No, you're not.

12:17.171 --> 12:19.390
You know, I happen to be
a pretty good detective.

12:19.434 --> 12:21.566
Yeah. But this is my business.

12:21.610 --> 12:23.743
So you're gonna butt out.

12:28.791 --> 12:30.793
[utensil stirring]

12:40.455 --> 12:42.152
Go on, say it.

12:43.110 --> 12:45.199
What?

12:45.242 --> 12:47.897
Oh, I know.
Something smells delicious.

12:47.941 --> 12:49.420
Damn straight.

12:49.464 --> 12:51.771
Good.

12:51.814 --> 12:53.816
One of my few regrets

12:53.860 --> 12:56.863
is that I learned how
to really cook so late in life.

12:56.906 --> 12:59.082
I bet you I could've saved

12:59.126 --> 13:01.084
over a million bucks in takeout,
you add it all up.

13:01.128 --> 13:03.043
Saved for what?

13:04.044 --> 13:05.262
What do you mean?

13:06.263 --> 13:08.788
Well, somebody talks
about savings,

13:08.831 --> 13:10.702
they usually have
a goal in mind.

13:12.661 --> 13:14.619
Do I need a lawyer?

13:14.663 --> 13:16.404
[chuckles]

13:16.447 --> 13:18.710
It's just a question, Pop.

13:18.754 --> 13:20.843
Francis.

13:20.887 --> 13:23.411
I remember how to lead a perp.

13:23.454 --> 13:25.500
What the hell
are you looking for?

13:27.632 --> 13:28.851
Okay.

13:32.159 --> 13:34.726
Melissa came to my office today.

13:36.728 --> 13:39.079
[mouths]

13:39.122 --> 13:41.646
That's privileged information.

13:41.690 --> 13:43.735
What is?

13:43.779 --> 13:45.259
What do you mean, what is?

13:45.302 --> 13:49.132
Well, all I said was,
she came to my office.

13:49.176 --> 13:50.960
That's not
privileged information.

13:51.004 --> 13:53.397
This ends right now.

13:53.441 --> 13:55.008
This is my business
and mine only.

13:55.051 --> 13:56.574
Which I respect...

13:56.618 --> 13:57.662
Then show it.

13:57.706 --> 13:59.012
You think

13:59.055 --> 14:01.275
I'm some old coot
that's being scammed.

14:01.318 --> 14:03.059
That's where
this is going, right?

14:03.103 --> 14:05.888
The only place it's going is
you flying off the handle.

14:05.932 --> 14:08.282
This is none of your business.

14:09.457 --> 14:11.720
Back off!

14:11.763 --> 14:13.330
I mean it.

14:17.987 --> 14:18.988
[sighs]

14:25.603 --> 14:27.649
[indistinct chatter]

14:30.913 --> 14:32.697
Did you notice that lady
giving us the eyeball?

14:32.741 --> 14:34.569
Couple that was just in here
did it, too.

14:34.612 --> 14:36.353
Duh, you're
in the papers.

14:36.397 --> 14:38.573
Nobody reads papers anymore.Yeah, they do.

14:38.616 --> 14:41.010
You're NYPD's shero.

14:41.054 --> 14:42.316
Get used to it.

14:44.187 --> 14:45.928
Hey, Murray,
we'll take the check.

14:45.972 --> 14:47.364
Uh, no can do.

14:47.408 --> 14:49.192
Can't accept
a meal on the arm.

14:49.236 --> 14:51.020
No, sorry, but the last two
customers bought your lunches.

14:51.064 --> 14:54.197
[quietly chanting]:
Shero, shero.

14:54.241 --> 14:56.547
Feels too good to stop,
doesn't it?

14:56.591 --> 14:58.201
Excuse me?

14:58.245 --> 14:59.811
The outfits, the badges.

14:59.855 --> 15:01.988
You may have people fooled
but not me.

15:02.989 --> 15:04.207
What are you talking about?

15:04.251 --> 15:05.730
[scoffs] It's a setup.

15:05.774 --> 15:08.211
That phony shooter,
you fake cops...

15:08.255 --> 15:09.647
Sorry, are you
seriously saying...?

15:09.691 --> 15:10.997
They're being paid
by the government

15:11.040 --> 15:12.172
to keep you all scared.

15:12.215 --> 15:13.303
But it's crap!

15:13.347 --> 15:14.914
Nothing happened yesterday

15:14.957 --> 15:15.958
and they're liars!

15:16.002 --> 15:17.481
They're crisis actors!

15:17.525 --> 15:19.048
Hey, pal!
What are you doing?

15:19.092 --> 15:20.049
You need to calm down, sir.

15:20.093 --> 15:21.572
You can't shut me up!

15:21.616 --> 15:23.574
Nobody died yesterday!

15:23.618 --> 15:27.274
The only thing that died
was the truth, and I know it!

15:27.317 --> 15:29.450
[patrons screaming]

15:32.975 --> 15:34.324
WOMAN:
Watch out!

15:38.763 --> 15:40.417
"Crisis actors"?

15:40.461 --> 15:41.941
What?

15:50.297 --> 15:53.343
Next up, disciplinary
action on Officer Viviano.

15:54.997 --> 15:57.521
Brian Viviano out of the 6-4.

16:00.655 --> 16:03.571
Citizen filmed him
asleep in his patrol car.

16:03.614 --> 16:05.268
Viviano says
he has a seizure disorder--

16:05.312 --> 16:07.618
which, by never
reporting it,

16:07.662 --> 16:09.098
is an infraction all by itself.

16:09.142 --> 16:10.970
So, was he asleep
or having a seizure?

16:11.013 --> 16:12.580
He was asleep.

16:12.623 --> 16:13.973
He says the seizure disorder
makes him doze off.

16:14.016 --> 16:16.279
So, what, narcolepsy?Well, he says no.

16:16.323 --> 16:19.369
So the medication
is what made him sleepy.

16:19.413 --> 16:22.329
That-that gets into
medical privacy territory.

16:22.372 --> 16:24.374
Okay. Don't want to do that.

16:24.418 --> 16:26.115
Um, just find out

16:26.159 --> 16:27.899
if the guy was sleeping off
a hangover.

16:27.943 --> 16:28.900
GORMLEY:
Okay.

16:28.944 --> 16:30.902
That is the list for...

16:30.946 --> 16:32.643
One more thing.

16:34.906 --> 16:35.995
Um...

16:37.692 --> 16:39.650
I don't know whether
this is out of line or not.

16:39.694 --> 16:41.174
Frankly... [laughs]

16:41.217 --> 16:43.828
I'm a little embarrassed
about it, but...

16:43.872 --> 16:47.223
I was hoping you all could
share something with me.

16:55.927 --> 16:57.059
Shoot.

16:57.103 --> 16:58.843
Okay.

17:00.062 --> 17:04.240
How close were you to your dads
in their later years?

17:07.243 --> 17:08.331
Because?

17:08.375 --> 17:10.246
Can't say.

17:12.901 --> 17:15.425
Well, me and my old man
weren't that tight.

17:15.469 --> 17:17.732
Even till the day he died,

17:17.775 --> 17:20.561
I'd call and he'd be like,
"How's your money holding up?

17:20.604 --> 17:23.346
How's your car running?
Here's your mom."

17:23.390 --> 17:28.699
Like he didn't really want
to get into things with you?

17:28.743 --> 17:31.572
Uh, I knew he loved me,
in his way, you know.

17:31.615 --> 17:34.879
I took it as a sign of respect.

17:34.923 --> 17:36.794
Like, you know,
"I'm not gonna pry."

17:36.838 --> 17:39.101
I wish mine had some of that.

17:39.145 --> 17:42.104
I got the overly involved,
touchy-feely model,

17:42.148 --> 17:44.715
what's now called
helicopter parenting.

17:44.759 --> 17:46.804
Even today,

17:46.848 --> 17:48.763
he sends clippings
from the local paper,

17:48.806 --> 17:52.549
showing me how their
PD spokesman talks to the press.

17:52.593 --> 17:54.203
I was his princess.

17:54.247 --> 17:56.031
I could do no wrong,

17:56.075 --> 17:58.077
and even when I did do wrong,

17:58.120 --> 17:59.861
it was the fault
of the boyfriend

17:59.904 --> 18:02.124
or the crowd that I was with.

18:02.168 --> 18:03.821
That clears up a lot.

18:05.127 --> 18:07.782
Henry got a beef with you, boss?

18:10.959 --> 18:12.613
Good guess.

18:14.354 --> 18:16.138
I'm sorry to hear that.

18:16.182 --> 18:19.402
Oh, my dad needs
at least one beef a day.

18:19.446 --> 18:21.839
Makes him feel vital and alive.

18:21.883 --> 18:23.580
Being his roommate,

18:23.624 --> 18:25.452
that puts me
in the starting rotation.

18:25.495 --> 18:27.802
So wait it out till
he lands on the next one.

18:27.845 --> 18:30.239
Well, I would love to, but I...
[sighs]

18:30.283 --> 18:33.590
I-I think I got to push back
on this one.

18:33.634 --> 18:36.245
Tough spot any way you cut it.

18:36.289 --> 18:38.073
Yeah.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.119
Can I ask one more favor,

18:40.162 --> 18:42.121
between the three of you?

18:42.164 --> 18:44.819
Could you find out
the son of a bitch

18:44.862 --> 18:47.387
that rents that P.O. box?

18:54.698 --> 18:55.960
The really crazy part

18:56.004 --> 18:57.440
is you telling your
Dad to butt out.

18:57.484 --> 18:59.573
Oh, tell me about it.He hammer you?

18:59.616 --> 19:01.444
Kind of the opposite,
actually.

19:01.488 --> 19:04.143
Yeah, he-he got up,
took his beer,

19:04.186 --> 19:05.927
and went up to his room
for the rest of the night.

19:05.970 --> 19:09.017
Wow. I-I would have gotten
a ten-hour lecture.

19:09.060 --> 19:11.672
Then transferred
to military school.
[laughs]

19:11.715 --> 19:12.977
See?

19:13.021 --> 19:14.631
Whoever it was,
they forgot

19:14.675 --> 19:15.850
all about me.

19:15.893 --> 19:17.068
Good news.

19:17.112 --> 19:18.592
See you after
phys ed.

19:21.899 --> 19:24.859
Son of a bitch.

19:24.902 --> 19:27.427
Well, I appreciate
your honesty.

19:27.470 --> 19:29.472
Don't even bother.

19:29.516 --> 19:30.995
Killer has to be Gerald.

19:31.039 --> 19:32.562
Really?

19:32.606 --> 19:36.000
Yeah. Drug collars,
failed rehabs.

19:36.044 --> 19:38.481
He even broke into the apartment
next door to his old man

19:38.525 --> 19:40.222
a month ago,
looking for cash.

19:40.266 --> 19:42.529
Yeah, well,
Ted Jr.'s ex-girlfriend

19:42.572 --> 19:44.487
says he's a grade A creep.

19:44.531 --> 19:46.141
I mean, yes,
he's more successful,

19:46.185 --> 19:48.099
yes, his dad hired him
to work at his company,

19:48.143 --> 19:51.233
but he still has
a hell of a temper.

19:51.277 --> 19:53.453
A couple of months ago,
he assaulted a delivery guy

19:53.496 --> 19:55.411
for bringing
the wrong order.

19:55.455 --> 19:58.327
You suggesting they pulled some
kind of Menendez brothers move?

19:58.371 --> 20:00.068
No. They hate each other.

20:00.111 --> 20:02.201
Yeah, they do hate each other,
don't they?

20:02.244 --> 20:03.854
What?

20:03.898 --> 20:06.205
Never mind. Nothing.
It's a bad idea.

20:06.248 --> 20:08.685
And that's stopped you... when?

20:08.729 --> 20:10.252
[sighs] Okay.

20:10.296 --> 20:11.688
What if
we bring them down here

20:11.732 --> 20:13.037
and let them go
toe-to-toe again?

20:13.081 --> 20:15.344
And not tell 'em
the other one's here?

20:15.388 --> 20:18.782
Nah, we'll just light a fuse
and watch it burn.

20:25.398 --> 20:26.877
Hey. You ID'd

20:26.921 --> 20:28.488
our EDP?Prints on the front door

20:28.531 --> 20:30.054
says his name is
David Bowles.

20:30.098 --> 20:32.622
In the system because of a DWI
a few years back.

20:32.666 --> 20:35.234
So, do I collar him?

20:35.277 --> 20:37.453
It's the pizza guy that got cut.

20:37.497 --> 20:40.108
He said to follow your lead.

20:42.937 --> 20:45.809
No, he's just delusional.
Locking him up won't help.

20:45.853 --> 20:47.376
More delusional than you know.

20:47.420 --> 20:49.117
You change your mind, call me.

20:54.340 --> 20:56.167
JANKO:
Hey, Witten.

20:57.168 --> 20:58.474
You're not gonna believe this.

20:58.518 --> 20:59.910
You went down the
rabbit hole, too?

20:59.954 --> 21:01.956
What rabbit hole?Oh, on YouTube.

21:01.999 --> 21:03.697
I looked up "crisis actors."

21:03.740 --> 21:05.829
You won't believe the amount
of crazy that's out there.

21:05.873 --> 21:08.005
Our shooter, Sandy Hook,
Parkland.

21:08.049 --> 21:09.746
These conspiracy nuts are
convinced that it's all fake.

21:09.790 --> 21:13.837
Part of some psyops, false
flag government operation.

21:13.881 --> 21:15.622
Okay, well, it gets crazier.

21:15.665 --> 21:18.929
The guy who called us
crisis actors

21:18.973 --> 21:21.280
is the father
of the girl who died.

21:34.380 --> 21:36.251
I mean, me and Jamie
used to fight all the time,

21:36.295 --> 21:37.470
but never
like these two.

21:37.513 --> 21:38.862
They say it's because
of the old man,

21:38.906 --> 21:40.647
but...

21:40.690 --> 21:41.778
it's just an excuse.

21:41.822 --> 21:43.084
We didn't need
an excuse, did we?

21:43.127 --> 21:45.652
Nope. We used to fight
just for fun.

21:45.695 --> 21:46.696
You two fought for fun?

21:46.740 --> 21:48.045
JAMIE:
Well, yeah.

21:48.089 --> 21:49.612
Roughhousing, more like it,
but, you know,

21:49.656 --> 21:51.571
with fists and teeth.

21:51.614 --> 21:53.355
Hockey sticks.Yeah,

21:53.399 --> 21:55.531
and lawn darts.Ah.

21:55.575 --> 21:57.577
Wonder why it is that Jack
and I never fought like that.

21:57.620 --> 21:59.666
Excuse me, I babysat,

21:59.709 --> 22:01.624
and I distinctly
remember you and Jack

22:01.668 --> 22:03.887
jousting with
the fireplace tools

22:03.931 --> 22:05.976
and me having
to throw away a certain rug.

22:06.020 --> 22:08.022
DANNY:
Talking about the rug
that Linda said

22:08.065 --> 22:10.503
she threw away because
you spilled red wine on it?

22:10.546 --> 22:13.201
I did, after Sean's
head split open.

22:13.244 --> 22:15.203
[gasps]DANNY: What kind of babysitter
lets a kid's head

22:15.246 --> 22:17.510
get split open, doesn't even
tell the father about it?

22:17.553 --> 22:18.598
[soft laughter]SEAN:
We gave her

22:18.641 --> 22:21.427
our allowance to stay quiet.

22:21.470 --> 22:24.386
Oh, you bribed the babysitter?
That's a sweet move.

22:24.430 --> 22:25.779
Why am I not surprised?

22:25.822 --> 22:27.215
Dad used to just let us
battle it out,

22:27.258 --> 22:28.390
and then Joe would
take on the winner.

22:28.434 --> 22:29.870
Whoa, wait. Dad encouraged it.

22:29.913 --> 22:31.437
He was the referee.

22:31.480 --> 22:33.308
Guess you were lucky Dad
didn't have any other siblings

22:33.352 --> 22:35.963
so you didn't have to break up
all these fights, huh, Pop?

22:36.920 --> 22:38.444
Lucky with him?

22:39.445 --> 22:41.447
Not the word I'd use.

22:43.753 --> 22:46.539
Blessed, that's the word.Ha.

22:46.582 --> 22:49.455
But sometimes
too stubborn to see it.

22:52.066 --> 22:55.156
Anyone else need a sweater
for the cold chill

22:55.199 --> 22:57.071
between these two?Right here.

22:57.114 --> 22:57.898
We're fine.

22:57.941 --> 22:59.247
The hell we are.

22:59.290 --> 23:01.728
Or we will be.

23:01.771 --> 23:04.644
You guys want to tell us
what's going on?

23:04.687 --> 23:06.123
HENRY:
Ask him,

23:06.167 --> 23:08.648
and if he says,
"Mind your own business,"

23:08.691 --> 23:10.998
ask him again
and again and again.

23:11.041 --> 23:13.174
Pop, that is not
exactly how it went.

23:13.217 --> 23:16.830
That is exactly how it went.

23:17.918 --> 23:19.267
Something you two
want to talk about?

23:19.310 --> 23:20.268
I'm fine.

23:20.311 --> 23:21.269
I'm fine.

23:21.312 --> 23:22.531
Apparently, it's all fine.

23:22.575 --> 23:23.706
It seems fine.

23:36.850 --> 23:38.417
You gonna do this all night?

23:39.548 --> 23:43.944
Actually, I'm
almost finished.

23:46.990 --> 23:49.776
Pop, I am truly sorry.

23:49.819 --> 23:51.125
I didn't mean to pry.

23:51.168 --> 23:53.257
Actions speak louder than words.

23:54.824 --> 23:56.391
Alex Van Helt.

23:59.002 --> 24:01.483
Reactions speak louder
than words.

24:01.527 --> 24:02.876
Your point?

24:02.919 --> 24:05.008
Well, I don't get it.

24:05.052 --> 24:06.836
The department said
it was a good shoot.

24:06.880 --> 24:09.012
So, case closed, then and now.

24:09.056 --> 24:11.058
Except for what?

24:12.886 --> 24:17.847
Except that to this day,
I don't know if it was true.

24:17.891 --> 24:20.459
My partner saw a gun.

24:22.417 --> 24:24.071
They never found it.

24:25.551 --> 24:27.509
And you doubt
your partner's word?

24:27.553 --> 24:30.817
No. He thought Van Helt
had a gun,

24:30.860 --> 24:33.646
but I was the one
who initiated the stop.

24:33.689 --> 24:36.823
And from that,
I put a guy into a wheelchair

24:36.866 --> 24:39.086
for the rest of his life.

24:43.264 --> 24:46.223
Pop...

24:46.267 --> 24:49.749
you do know that Van Helt died
nine years ago, don't you?

24:49.792 --> 24:53.492
Someone keeps opening
that P.O. box.

24:55.798 --> 24:57.931
His wife, his kids.

24:57.974 --> 25:00.107
I don't know.

25:00.150 --> 25:02.196
Someone who needs money.

25:06.592 --> 25:08.855
And if it gets out
that the former PC

25:08.898 --> 25:11.118
is giving cash to the victim

25:11.161 --> 25:14.600
of what he considers
a questionable shooting?

25:14.643 --> 25:17.472
It will never get out.

25:18.908 --> 25:20.693
I hope you're right.

25:20.736 --> 25:23.391
And don't wind me up with that

25:23.434 --> 25:27.308
"This will reflect badly
on the department" crap.

25:27.351 --> 25:29.136
I won't.

25:29.179 --> 25:31.965
Lucky for you
if you're one of the few

25:32.008 --> 25:34.445
that don't carry any regrets.

25:34.489 --> 25:37.318
That's not true. Of course I do.

25:38.319 --> 25:40.103
Yeah, but if you do,

25:40.147 --> 25:42.932
you can put them into a box.

25:42.976 --> 25:45.456
You're good at that. I'm not.

25:49.330 --> 25:51.898
I'm not good at it.

25:51.941 --> 25:53.987
I just do it.

26:02.125 --> 26:04.475
I've already answered
your questions, Detective.

26:04.519 --> 26:07.261
I know, but our investigating
has led to some more questions

26:07.304 --> 26:08.654
that we need answering.Right this way.

26:10.307 --> 26:11.613
BOTH: What is he doing here?Whoa.

26:11.657 --> 26:12.658
Sorry, I didn't realize

26:12.701 --> 26:14.921
you two were in here.

26:14.964 --> 26:16.531
No, no problem at all. Uh...

26:16.575 --> 26:17.619
Why don't you sit down,
we'll make it a party?

26:17.663 --> 26:18.794
No, not with this loser.

26:18.838 --> 26:20.274
Oh, and you're such a winner?

26:20.317 --> 26:22.406
Okay, time-out.
Look, you, sit down.

26:22.450 --> 26:24.539
Let's talk.

26:26.802 --> 26:28.543
[sighs]

26:30.719 --> 26:32.895
I'll tell you what we can do.

26:32.939 --> 26:34.593
You two hash it out,

26:34.636 --> 26:36.029
and whoever
can convince us

26:36.072 --> 26:37.944
that they didn't do it can walk.

26:37.987 --> 26:39.032
How about that?

26:39.075 --> 26:40.381
I want my attorney.

26:40.424 --> 26:41.338
Yeah, same here.

26:41.382 --> 26:43.340
[clears throat]

26:44.515 --> 26:46.735
How about you write
some numbers down,

26:46.779 --> 26:48.389
and we'll give them a call?

26:48.432 --> 26:50.086
Yeah. I mean, it's probably
gonna take a while,

26:50.130 --> 26:51.653
but we'll wait.

26:51.697 --> 26:53.133
And in the meantime,
I sit in here with him?

26:53.176 --> 26:54.961
He killed my dad!

26:55.004 --> 26:56.658
He was my dad, too.

26:56.702 --> 26:58.921
At least get one thing right
for once in your life.

26:58.965 --> 27:00.967
He was our father.

27:01.010 --> 27:02.316
Oh, what are you gonna do,
cry now?

27:02.359 --> 27:03.665
You know,
you've spent your whole life

27:03.709 --> 27:04.971
acting like me and my mom
didn't exist.

27:05.014 --> 27:07.582
Oh, I knew damn well
you existed.

27:07.626 --> 27:08.888
How could I not?

27:08.931 --> 27:10.498
Everything was
"Poor Gerald this,

27:10.541 --> 27:12.326
poor Gerald that."
It's like I've had

27:12.369 --> 27:14.807
a sickly five-year-old brother
I never wanted.

27:14.850 --> 27:16.547
What kind of a dick
deletes a guy's number

27:16.591 --> 27:18.201
from his own father's phone?

27:18.245 --> 27:19.768
They sound a lot like my kids.

27:20.682 --> 27:22.510
What are you talking about?
I never deleted your number.

27:22.553 --> 27:23.816
How come he never
answered my texts?

27:23.859 --> 27:25.121
He texted with you constantly.

27:25.165 --> 27:26.166
Every time I was
with him last year,

27:26.209 --> 27:28.168
it was, "Bing, bing, bing."

27:28.211 --> 27:30.431
No, no, that's what happened
when you knew he was with me.

27:30.474 --> 27:32.520
Hey, wait-wait a minute.
Time-out.

27:33.782 --> 27:36.829
Did either of you
actually see the texts

27:36.872 --> 27:38.700
or who he was texting with?

27:39.875 --> 27:40.746
No.

27:40.789 --> 27:42.269
No, but who else would Dad

27:42.312 --> 27:44.010
have been texting with?

27:44.053 --> 27:46.316
I mean, guys his age
only text with his kids.

27:46.360 --> 27:48.057
Otherwise they talk
on the phone.

27:48.101 --> 27:50.625
That's actually a good question.

27:50.669 --> 27:52.714
I have his phone
sitting in an evidence bag.

27:52.758 --> 27:54.716
I was about to take it
down to CCS

27:54.760 --> 27:56.152
and have them go through it.

27:56.196 --> 27:58.938
Yeah, why don't we save them
the trouble?

28:01.418 --> 28:03.725
I just don't think
this is a good idea.

28:03.769 --> 28:05.727
I just want to talk to him.

28:05.771 --> 28:07.337
[sighs]
The guy lost his daughter.

28:07.381 --> 28:08.687
Hasn't he suffered enough?

28:08.730 --> 28:10.558
By disrespecting
his daughter's death?

28:10.601 --> 28:12.212
Disrespecting what I had to do?

28:12.255 --> 28:13.779
Rachel, I know it's crazy,

28:13.822 --> 28:15.563
e-especially him saying
that we were complicit

28:15.606 --> 28:18.000
in some big lie, but he doesn't
actually believe it.

28:18.044 --> 28:19.654
Says who?

28:19.698 --> 28:22.135
I talked to the cops who
did the next of kin notification

28:22.178 --> 28:26.139
and they said that Mr. Bowles
totally melted down.

28:26.182 --> 28:28.271
He screamed that Alyssa
couldn't be dead,

28:28.315 --> 28:31.492
that she'd been in Montauk
the weekend before

28:31.535 --> 28:33.059
and that she just hadn't
come home yet.

28:33.102 --> 28:34.756
Okay.

28:34.800 --> 28:36.845
And then I went online and I saw
those conspiracy trolls

28:36.889 --> 28:40.806
bragging about
how they'd found his number.

28:40.849 --> 28:44.592
They started bombarding him
with all that psyop crap.

28:44.635 --> 28:47.116
They-they went
after the victim's dad?

28:47.160 --> 28:48.944
It's what they do.

28:48.988 --> 28:51.686
They find someone vulnerable
and they pounce.

28:51.730 --> 28:55.081
And he believed it because...

28:55.124 --> 28:57.257
Facing the truth
about his daughter's death

28:57.300 --> 28:58.998
would completely destroy him.

29:17.146 --> 29:19.192
What do we do now?

29:23.849 --> 29:25.111
Ms. Wilson.

29:25.154 --> 29:26.939
Yes?

29:26.982 --> 29:29.637
Hi, I've never had your class,
but my name is Sean...

29:29.680 --> 29:32.466
Sean Reagan. I know who you are.

29:32.509 --> 29:35.077
I know you're not exactly
the biggest fan of my family.

29:36.209 --> 29:38.124
Is there a question here, Sean?

29:38.167 --> 29:41.823
Someone wrote "ACAB"
all over my locker.

29:41.867 --> 29:43.869
So I heard.
How?

29:43.912 --> 29:45.871
It's a high school.

29:45.914 --> 29:47.873
Where the main office

29:47.916 --> 29:50.223
has everyone's
locker combinations on file.

29:50.266 --> 29:51.964
And I imagine

29:52.007 --> 29:53.661
that the teachers
would have access.

29:53.704 --> 29:54.880
Excuse me?

29:55.924 --> 29:58.144
You know what ACAB means, right?

29:58.187 --> 30:00.189
All cops are bastards.

30:00.233 --> 30:02.322
Which you agree with, right?

30:02.365 --> 30:04.150
You're putting words
in my mouth.

30:04.193 --> 30:06.761
They're your words.
It's what you teach.

30:07.762 --> 30:09.242
Used to teach.

30:10.460 --> 30:12.245
Last summer,

30:12.288 --> 30:15.726
looting broke out
in my neighborhood.

30:15.770 --> 30:20.166
First I thought, "Yes, oh,
the revolution is finally here."

30:20.209 --> 30:21.732
And then they...

30:23.386 --> 30:25.519
They weren't protesters.

30:25.562 --> 30:28.783
I know what a protest
looks like.

30:28.827 --> 30:31.786
They started torching
the cars on my block.

30:31.830 --> 30:34.876
And I watched the cops put
their lives on the line

30:34.920 --> 30:37.009
to stop the violence.

30:38.967 --> 30:41.230
I-I'm not saying
they're all angels...

30:41.274 --> 30:42.884
But they're not all
the devil either.

30:42.928 --> 30:45.191
Not that night, not on my block.

30:45.234 --> 30:47.019
Sean,

30:47.062 --> 30:49.369
it wasn't me who wrote that.

30:49.412 --> 30:51.023
But someone did.

30:51.066 --> 30:53.808
And somehow they got
my locker combination.

30:53.852 --> 30:56.724
Any friends hang out
while you open your locker?

30:56.767 --> 30:59.031
Why do you ask that?

30:59.074 --> 31:00.989
In case you haven't noticed,
Sean,

31:01.033 --> 31:03.513
the world's turned upside down.

31:10.607 --> 31:13.132
[indistinct chatter]

31:15.482 --> 31:16.787
Hello, ladies.

31:16.831 --> 31:19.312
Hey, Sean.

31:22.968 --> 31:24.839
[chatter continues]

31:29.888 --> 31:32.412
Where is she?There she is.

31:32.455 --> 31:34.936
I hope you found out
who killed Mr. Bradley.

31:34.980 --> 31:37.460
We did, it just took a while.
Hands behind your back.

31:37.504 --> 31:39.593
What?We're making a withdrawal.

31:39.636 --> 31:41.464
And you're it.

31:41.508 --> 31:43.249
What are you talking about?

31:43.292 --> 31:45.599
Gaslighting an old man
that his kids were out

31:45.642 --> 31:47.427
to drain his accounts
so he better start

31:47.470 --> 31:49.168
hoarding large chunks
of cash at home?

31:49.211 --> 31:50.865
Then he takes a hundred
grand out of the bank,

31:50.909 --> 31:53.563
you follow him home
and pay him a surprise visit.

31:53.607 --> 31:55.478
No, I-I didn't do that.

31:55.522 --> 31:57.263
No, they're lying.Nobody's lying

31:57.306 --> 31:58.655
except you, okay?

31:58.699 --> 32:00.396
We saw the app
you had him download,

32:00.440 --> 32:02.703
we read all the text messages
between you guys.

32:02.746 --> 32:04.009
What do you say, partner?

32:04.052 --> 32:05.967
Jury takes about an hour
to convict?

32:06.011 --> 32:08.274
I give 'em 30 minutes.
Let's go.

32:08.317 --> 32:11.451
You know, I was the only
good person in his life.

32:11.494 --> 32:13.322
He would have wanted me
to have that money!

32:13.366 --> 32:15.063
You're probably right.

32:15.107 --> 32:17.196
I don't deserve this!

32:17.239 --> 32:19.067
And he didn't deserve
a knife in the back.

32:23.854 --> 32:26.988
Hey, were you in Montauk?
Did you see this girl there?

32:27.032 --> 32:28.555
Hey, excuse me, excuse me.

32:28.598 --> 32:30.209
My daughter was supposed
to come home last week,

32:30.252 --> 32:31.993
but she must've missed her bus.
Have you seen her?

32:32.037 --> 32:34.082
No. Sorry, sir.H-Have you seen
this girl before?

32:34.126 --> 32:35.214
No, sorry.She was in Montauk last week.

32:35.257 --> 32:36.737
He's been showing up every day.

32:36.780 --> 32:38.913
I told him to leave, but
he keeps coming back.

32:38.957 --> 32:40.480
He's in a bad place.

32:40.523 --> 32:42.003
But you'll arrest him, right?

32:42.047 --> 32:43.787
Sir?I mean, he's harassing people.

32:43.831 --> 32:46.138
Don't worry,
we'll take care of it.

32:46.181 --> 32:48.053
BOWLES:
She's my daughter. She was
supposed to be home last week.

32:48.096 --> 32:49.402
No?
No.

32:49.445 --> 32:50.403
Thank you.

32:50.446 --> 32:52.535
Excuse me, have...? Oh.

32:52.579 --> 32:53.928
It's you two.

32:53.972 --> 32:55.147
Mr. Bowles,
we're here to help you.

32:55.190 --> 32:56.626
How?

32:56.670 --> 32:58.672
By disappearing me
because I'm on to you?

32:59.847 --> 33:02.458
They're imposters. If anything
happens to me, they did it.

33:02.502 --> 33:05.331
Look, Alyssa is not coming
off of one of these buses.

33:05.374 --> 33:06.332
Yes, she is.

33:06.375 --> 33:07.376
No, she isn't.

33:07.420 --> 33:08.377
She got back last week,

33:08.421 --> 33:09.552
just like she planned,

33:09.596 --> 33:11.424
and then she went to her job

33:11.467 --> 33:13.339
the very next day.

33:13.382 --> 33:14.818
Why do you keep lying?

33:14.862 --> 33:17.169
We were there.
We tried to help her.

33:17.212 --> 33:20.085
My daughter just isn't back
from her weekend trip.

33:20.128 --> 33:22.522
When she gets back,
I'm gonna find her.

33:22.565 --> 33:24.741
We've had some
problems lately.

33:24.785 --> 33:27.875
Stupid disagreements that...

33:27.918 --> 33:31.835
You-you can't let those be
your last words.

33:33.011 --> 33:34.403
That's why I have to find her.

33:34.447 --> 33:36.275
And we know where she is.

33:36.318 --> 33:39.278
Yeah, come on.

33:39.321 --> 33:40.888
We'll take you there.

33:45.675 --> 33:48.417
So the lady at the bank
killed him?

33:48.461 --> 33:50.115
Yes. She confessed to it.

33:50.158 --> 33:51.725
After throwing a
tantrum, of course.

33:51.768 --> 33:53.683
I can't believe it.Yeah, 'cause you were

33:53.727 --> 33:55.120
too busy blaming me.

33:55.163 --> 33:56.425
Same thing you
were doing to me.

33:56.469 --> 33:58.340
Listen, you-you stuck-up
son of a bitch.

33:58.384 --> 34:00.951
All right.
Can you two just stop, please?

34:00.995 --> 34:02.127
All right?

34:02.170 --> 34:03.824
He didn't do it
and he didn't do it.

34:03.867 --> 34:05.478
End of discussion.

34:05.521 --> 34:07.175
Seriously, look,
I didn't know your old man.

34:07.219 --> 34:09.525
Okay? But I know fathers,
I know sons, I know families.

34:09.569 --> 34:10.918
Now, if you're gonna take

34:10.961 --> 34:12.659
any positive out of this,
take away

34:12.702 --> 34:14.704
the fact that you're family.

34:14.748 --> 34:16.967
Okay, you're all you got now,
for better or worse,

34:17.011 --> 34:18.447
so figure it out.

34:20.406 --> 34:21.363
Buy you a drink?

34:21.407 --> 34:22.669
Really? Alcohol?

34:22.712 --> 34:23.496
Forget it.

34:23.539 --> 34:24.758
Just say yes.

34:24.801 --> 34:26.412
Come on, your problems

34:26.455 --> 34:28.153
are bigger than
his drinking problem.

34:28.196 --> 34:29.806
No offense.

34:29.850 --> 34:32.853
How about O'Keefe's?

34:32.896 --> 34:34.681
It's the first place
Dad ever bought me one.

34:34.724 --> 34:38.076
Yeah. Me, too.
Booth in the back.

34:38.119 --> 34:39.773
Yeah.

34:39.816 --> 34:42.384
There you go.
All right, knock yourselves out.

34:45.344 --> 34:47.563
But not with your fists.

34:51.132 --> 34:53.221
Why didn't you wait
for me to walk home?

34:54.483 --> 34:56.572
And the way you blew
by me in the hall.

34:56.616 --> 34:58.531
You got something
against my friends?

34:58.574 --> 35:02.883
Yeah, the one with "ACAB"
written on her notebook.

35:04.798 --> 35:06.278
Corrine?

35:06.321 --> 35:08.715
Why'd you give her
my locker combo?

35:08.758 --> 35:09.890
I didn't.

35:09.933 --> 35:11.283
Principal will figure it out.

35:11.326 --> 35:12.762
You're going to the principal?

35:12.806 --> 35:13.981
You tell me.

35:14.024 --> 35:15.113
Those girls--

35:15.156 --> 35:17.115
Cindy and Amanda and Corrine.

35:19.029 --> 35:21.119
We all started hanging online

35:21.162 --> 35:22.685
and became friends.

35:24.600 --> 35:27.734
But when they found out I also
hang with you, they went off.

35:29.823 --> 35:33.087
How the police are pigs.

35:33.131 --> 35:35.916
You just threw them a bone.

35:35.959 --> 35:38.223
I haven't made a lot
of girlfriends

35:38.266 --> 35:40.486
since I moved here.

35:40.529 --> 35:42.836
I just, I didn't
want to lose them.

35:42.879 --> 35:45.491
It sounds so stupid
saying it. Sean...

35:47.232 --> 35:50.409
You're never gonna
forgive me, are you?

35:50.452 --> 35:53.586
Piece of advice
I heard constantly

35:53.629 --> 35:55.675
growing up in a family of cops?

35:55.718 --> 35:57.503
What?

35:57.546 --> 36:00.810
Everybody makes mistakes.

36:03.378 --> 36:04.640
See you later.

36:04.684 --> 36:06.120
For now.

36:13.040 --> 36:15.085
â™ª

36:29.665 --> 36:31.232
Take a seat.

36:33.191 --> 36:35.367
[door closes]

36:41.329 --> 36:43.375
Worked things out with my dad.

36:43.418 --> 36:45.768
Thanks for what you said.
It helped me.

36:45.812 --> 36:47.509
That's great to hear, boss.

36:47.553 --> 36:49.468
You don't want to let
those things drag out.

36:49.511 --> 36:50.643
Yeah, well,
the long and short of it:

36:50.686 --> 36:52.427
he's not the kind of man
who could

36:52.471 --> 36:55.213
store his regrets in a box.

36:55.256 --> 36:58.172
He actively worries
how his actions

36:58.216 --> 37:00.392
affect the other person.

37:05.048 --> 37:07.660
And it got me wondering.

37:10.315 --> 37:12.795
Regrets.

37:12.839 --> 37:14.841
I've had a few.

37:15.972 --> 37:19.454
But then again,
too few to mention?

37:25.025 --> 37:27.375
Sid... [chuckles]

37:27.419 --> 37:29.769
you miss
being in the rank and file.

37:29.812 --> 37:31.510
No, boss.

37:31.553 --> 37:32.946
That wasn't a question.

37:32.989 --> 37:35.383
Every sad sack and sideways cop

37:35.427 --> 37:37.646
whose problem lands
on this office,

37:37.690 --> 37:42.695
your first instinct is
to erect a statue for the guy.

37:42.738 --> 37:45.872
You love 'em all,
and the more warts the better.

37:45.915 --> 37:48.004
Well...

37:50.355 --> 37:53.271
Abigail,
you are a talented detective

37:53.314 --> 37:55.751
and those talents
are seldom used up here.

37:58.450 --> 38:01.235
It's kind of like
you're an ace pilot

38:01.279 --> 38:05.370
and you're stuck working in
the air traffic control tower.

38:07.807 --> 38:10.592
And you, my friend,

38:10.636 --> 38:13.900
you'd make a lot more money
and get a lot less grief

38:13.943 --> 38:15.815
in the private sector.

38:18.948 --> 38:20.907
You know it and I know it.

38:22.517 --> 38:24.911
So...

38:24.954 --> 38:29.394
if any of you would like
a glowing recommendation

38:29.437 --> 38:31.134
for a new job...

38:33.136 --> 38:35.922
...I will recommend
you gladly,

38:35.965 --> 38:37.880
heartily,

38:37.924 --> 38:40.753
with no questions asked

38:40.796 --> 38:46.411
and with nothing
but gratitude...

38:46.454 --> 38:49.327
for all that you have given me.

38:54.244 --> 38:56.029
Thank you, sir.

38:56.072 --> 38:57.770
But I'm staying.

38:59.989 --> 39:02.252
I'm good right where I am.

39:04.211 --> 39:05.647
Me, too.

39:05.691 --> 39:07.301
But with a raise.

39:07.345 --> 39:08.868
[soft laughter]

39:12.219 --> 39:14.047
Give him an inch...

39:21.576 --> 39:24.753
If I thought I was holding
any of you back,

39:24.797 --> 39:28.409
I would always regret that.

39:28.453 --> 39:33.066
And I would never be able
to put that regret in a box.

39:37.113 --> 39:39.159
[soft chatter]

39:44.773 --> 39:45.818
[door closes]

39:57.133 --> 39:59.005
â™ª

39:59.048 --> 40:01.921
[crying]

40:10.364 --> 40:11.931
[quietly]:
Oh...

40:15.543 --> 40:16.979
Sweetheart.

40:19.504 --> 40:22.420
I'm so sorry
I couldn't protect you.

40:23.899 --> 40:25.858
But come on.

40:25.901 --> 40:27.947
It's time to go home.
