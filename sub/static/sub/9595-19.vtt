there doing your dead face.

08:35.215 --> 08:38.183
Well, it -- it --
that's -- it was...

08:38.185 --> 08:40.952
Uh, uh, no, no, no. Wait.
Did you just say "engaged"?

08:40.954 --> 08:43.288
Well, I mean...
[ laughing ] come on.

08:43.290 --> 08:45.524
I wouldn't --
I wouldn't call it --

08:45.526 --> 08:47.058
I wouldn't
call it "engaged."

08:47.060 --> 08:48.860
Well, what would you call it
when one person

08:48.862 --> 08:50.729
Asks another person to marry him
and she says "yes"

08:50.731 --> 08:52.297
And then he buys her a ring
and then they invite

08:52.299 --> 08:54.199
All their friends to applebee's
for jalapeño poppers?

08:54.201 --> 08:55.934
Both: Engaged.

08:55.936 --> 08:58.069
Or like a party.
[ laughs ] it's like...

08:58.071 --> 09:01.973
Wow. This just stopped
being polite...

09:01.975 --> 09:03.975
And got really real.

09:03.977 --> 09:06.845
Whoa. Lance would have been
our dad?

09:06.847 --> 09:09.214
And shawn would have been
our mom?

09:09.216 --> 09:11.283
So hot!

09:11.285 --> 09:13.218
She would have been
your<i> mom.</i>

09:13.220 --> 09:14.920
Dre: Bow.
Rainbow: Uh-huh?

09:14.922 --> 09:16.922
Can I talk to you
for a second?
Sure, sweetie.

09:16.924 --> 09:18.323
Now.
Just a second.

09:18.325 --> 09:19.324
Um, enjoy the food,
and I'm gonna refill...
Come on.

09:19.326 --> 09:20.325
I think he wants a refill.

09:24.797 --> 09:26.965
Sweetheart. Yeah,
we were engaged, but it
was, like, so long ago.

09:26.967 --> 09:28.867
It was like for 10 minutes,

09:28.869 --> 09:30.969
And we were young
and we were stupid,

09:30.971 --> 09:33.872
And, like, we went five-way
dutch on jalapeño poppers.

09:33.874 --> 09:36.775
I mean, I didn't even get any
and shawn ate...

09:36.777 --> 09:38.843
I-I should have told you.

09:38.845 --> 09:40.912
I should have told you,
and I didn't.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.914
I'm sorry.

09:42.916 --> 09:47.285
Babe, I'm really gonna
surprise you now --

09:47.287 --> 09:48.587
I get it.

09:48.589 --> 09:49.988
Seriously?
Huh!

09:49.990 --> 09:51.723
Yes, it's ancient history.
Yeah.

09:51.725 --> 09:54.292
Plus, there's plenty of things
I haven't told you about.

09:54.294 --> 09:55.160
Wait, what -- what, now?

09:55.162 --> 09:56.595
But the point is,

09:56.597 --> 09:58.797
All of our secrets are out
in the open now.

09:58.799 --> 10:02.300
Ah, ah, ah, let's not forget
who's in the hot seat.

10:02.302 --> 10:04.603
Actually, you're just lucky

10:04.605 --> 10:08.006
That you married a man
like me -- magnanimous.

10:08.008 --> 10:09.908
See?
Hmm.

10:09.910 --> 10:11.643
We're meant to be.

10:11.645 --> 10:13.745
If lance hadn't broken it off
with me,

10:13.747 --> 10:15.747
I never would have met you,
my dre.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.248
Oh.
Thanks, baby.

10:17.250 --> 10:18.350
<i>Hold on.</i>

10:18.352 --> 10:21.753
<i>Did she just say</i>
<i>lance dumped her?</i>

10:21.755 --> 10:23.388
<i>Who the hell am I married to?</i>

10:23.390 --> 10:25.857
This is crazy, man.

10:25.859 --> 10:28.727
I always saw me and bow
as this power couple --

10:28.729 --> 10:30.695
The dumpers,
not the dumpees.

10:30.697 --> 10:34.132
Look, who cares if he looked her
dead in the face and said,

10:34.134 --> 10:36.134
"there's no way I want to go
further with this"?

10:36.136 --> 10:39.004
That's his thing.
One man's trash, right?

10:39.006 --> 10:40.171
No!

10:40.173 --> 10:41.973
Man, bow and I
are a-listers.

10:41.975 --> 10:44.075
[ stammers ]
jay and bey.

10:44.077 --> 10:46.077
Look, I'm just worried
that now I'm jay

10:46.079 --> 10:48.146
And she's one of those
other girls --

10:48.148 --> 10:51.049
Destiny's illegitimate
child, hazel.

10:51.051 --> 10:53.018
Hey, dre,
get out of your head, man.

10:53.020 --> 10:56.021
Look at me.
I always get dumped.

10:56.023 --> 10:59.157
That don't make me a loser,
you know?

10:59.159 --> 11:01.326
Dre, there is
absolutely nothing wrong

11:01.328 --> 11:03.862
With a man dating a woman
who's been dumped.

11:03.864 --> 11:05.296
You don't think so?
No, man.

11:05.298 --> 11:07.766
I almost exclusively date women
who have been dumped.

11:07.768 --> 11:10.669
I'll wait outside the club
by the street meat cart,

11:10.671 --> 11:12.971
Looking for girls to stumble out
at closing

11:12.973 --> 11:15.206
With runny mascara
and a broken heel.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.375
Then your boy josh
goes to wiz-erk!

11:17.377 --> 11:19.911
I'll whisper in their ear,
"you can do better.

11:19.913 --> 11:22.047
You can do better.
Shh, shh, shh.

11:22.049 --> 11:23.915
But not tonight."
mm? [ laughs ]

11:23.917 --> 11:25.050
Feel better?

11:25.052 --> 11:26.084
No.
Okay.

11:26.086 --> 11:27.385
Look, just let it go, boss.

11:27.387 --> 11:29.287
Okay, you start digging
in a cemetery,

11:29.289 --> 11:31.022
All you gonna find
is dead bodies.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.091
You know, you right, curtis.
You're right.

11:33.093 --> 11:35.060
You know,
I'm gonna leave it alone.

11:35.062 --> 11:35.994
<i>I did not leave it alone.</i>

11:35.996 --> 11:38.296
Hey, lance.
More scotch?

11:38.298 --> 11:40.932
Oh, thank you.
All right.

11:40.934 --> 11:43.702
<i>I told you that lance and I</i>
<i>were engaged.</i>

11:43.704 --> 11:45.370
<i>Of course I did!</i>

11:45.372 --> 11:46.905
Money.
"old people eating cheese"

11:46.907 --> 11:48.940
Just graduated
to "mom's secret fiancé

11:48.942 --> 11:50.308
Could wreck her marriage."

11:50.310 --> 11:53.011
Why is there so much footage
of that lady's butt?

11:53.013 --> 11:56.147
It's called "ambient b-roll,"
and I need it.

11:56.149 --> 11:59.017
[ gasps ]<i> we</i> need it.
[ chuckles weakly ]

11:59.019 --> 12:00.952
<i>I</i> need it.

12:00.954 --> 12:03.088
We still need to find a villain
in all this.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.489
There's a villain
in our house?

12:04.491 --> 12:08.426
No. All reality shows
have a villain --

12:08.428 --> 12:10.729
The drama queen
you love to hate,

12:10.731 --> 12:13.431
Your snookis, your omarosas,
your bryant gumbels.

12:13.433 --> 12:14.999
Now let's go find ours.

12:17.470 --> 12:19.370
My money's on maisie.

12:19.372 --> 12:20.905
Jack:
Really? Why her?

12:20.907 --> 12:24.776
I saw her double dip
in the ponzu.

12:24.778 --> 12:27.011
Dirty, dirty girl.

12:28.981 --> 12:31.249
Kind of crazy finding out
that you and bow

12:31.251 --> 12:32.817
Were engaged
and everything.

12:32.819 --> 12:34.252
Oh, I'm so sorry.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.454
All these years,
I assumed you knew.
It's cool.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.356
Hey, just curious
how it all ended.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.091
You know,
was it the type of thing

12:40.093 --> 12:41.960
Where you saw the writing
on the wall

12:41.962 --> 12:43.394
With a girl
that spectacular?

12:43.396 --> 12:45.764
You know, did you dump her
before she dumped you?

12:45.766 --> 12:47.432
Hey, hey, no shame
in that game, playboy.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.167
I don't know. Who can remember?
It was college.

12:49.169 --> 12:50.835
College. I get it.

12:50.837 --> 12:53.304
A little experimental phase,
huh?

12:53.306 --> 12:55.240
Not sure what team
you were playing for.

12:55.242 --> 12:57.275
Yeah, no, no, had to clear
the deck for mr. Right.

12:57.277 --> 12:58.409
Dre, I'm not gay.

12:58.411 --> 13:00.445
You've been staring at my wife
all night.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.347
In fact,
you're doing it right now.

13:02.349 --> 13:03.815
Huh?

13:03.817 --> 13:06.551
Look, man,
if I had to dig deep here,

13:06.553 --> 13:08.319
I guess I had to end things
with bow

13:08.321 --> 13:10.188
Because...She was still
not over brian.

13:10.190 --> 13:11.389
Who's brian?

13:11.391 --> 13:13.191
The guy who dumped her
after mike.
What?!

13:13.193 --> 13:18.496
I have had a spontaneous idea --
let's play a game!

13:18.498 --> 13:20.198
This isn't gonna be
the type of thing

13:20.200 --> 13:22.333
Where we're gonna get naked,
are we?

13:22.335 --> 13:24.202
Hmm?
Full disclosure?

13:24.204 --> 13:27.472
I had a botched circumcision
a few years ago.

13:27.474 --> 13:29.841
Just so you know.

13:29.843 --> 13:32.410
What about celebrity charades,
huh?
Dre: Oh!

13:32.412 --> 13:35.480
I actually had a different
kind of game in mind.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.248
Really?
Yeah.

13:37.250 --> 13:40.852
<i>So, I'm not proud of how this</i>
<i>is about to go down,</i>

13:40.854 --> 13:42.120
<i>But I needed answers.</i>

13:42.122 --> 13:43.521
All right.

13:43.523 --> 13:45.990
Everybody know how to play
"I never"?

13:45.992 --> 13:48.593
It's where I say something
I have never done,

13:48.595 --> 13:51.863
Like, "I have never been dumped
by a guy named brian."

13:51.865 --> 13:53.565
Wait, what?
Maisie: Oh, I'll explain.

13:53.567 --> 13:55.066
You've been dumped by a guy
named brian...

13:55.068 --> 13:56.301
Yes, thank you.
Oh!

13:56.303 --> 13:57.535
...So you drink.

13:57.537 --> 13:58.870
Okay.
There you go.

13:58.872 --> 13:59.871
Maisie: I'll go next.

13:59.873 --> 14:01.172
I've never spent

14:01.174 --> 14:03.908
A thanksgiving meeting
david spade's parents.

14:03.910 --> 14:05.944
Oh, that's me!

14:05.946 --> 14:07.345
Yeah, that's her.
[ laughs ]
all right.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.047
Okay, I'm gonna go next.
I'm gonna go next.

14:09.049 --> 14:13.551
I never had to balance
having four children

14:13.553 --> 14:16.487
While managing a very
challenging medical career.

14:16.489 --> 14:18.056
Oh.
Ho-ho!

14:18.058 --> 14:19.290
Down the hatch!
All right.

14:19.292 --> 14:20.291
Mm-hmm.
Ah.

14:20.293 --> 14:21.993
Okay, okay.
I have one.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.494
I have never been dumped

14:23.496 --> 14:26.130
By more than three people
in college.

14:26.132 --> 14:27.232
Yes.

14:27.234 --> 14:28.266
Ha, josh!

14:28.268 --> 14:29.200
Josh!

14:29.202 --> 14:30.268
Drink up, bow.

14:30.270 --> 14:32.370
Oh, you too, huh?

14:32.372 --> 14:34.239
Yeah, thank you, shawn.
Yeah.

14:34.241 --> 14:36.307
Dre: [ laughs ] see?
This is fun.

14:36.309 --> 14:38.543
Well, anybody else have
any stories about bow?

14:38.545 --> 14:40.945
Lance, I'm sure you're sitting
on a couple of gems.
Dre --

14:40.947 --> 14:43.948
Oh, hell yeah.
I never had "finals baldness."

14:43.950 --> 14:45.116
What?
[ stammers ]

14:45.118 --> 14:47.418
It's called stress-related
alopecia,

14:47.420 --> 14:49.954
And millions of americans
suffer from it.

14:49.956 --> 14:52.924
Yes, so I'm not embarrassed.
I will drink.

14:52.926 --> 14:56.027
Oh, let's go back to
an old favorite of mine.

14:56.029 --> 15:00.231
I have never been dumped by more
than<i> four</i> people in college.

[ laughter ]

15:12.045 --> 15:13.978
Damn.

15:13.980 --> 15:17.448
Okay, yeah, obviously I have
a few skeletons in my closet.

15:17.450 --> 15:18.950
Ohh!

15:18.952 --> 15:20.418
More than eight?

15:22.289 --> 15:24.022
[ laughter ]
okay, okay, okay, okay.

15:24.024 --> 15:27.025
Enough! Enough!
Why are you attacking me?!

15:27.027 --> 15:29.360
This is not how the night
was supposed to go.

15:29.362 --> 15:32.230
You guys were just supposed
to admire my bangles

15:32.232 --> 15:36.167
And -- and eat my
almonds and just watch
me float like an angel!

15:36.169 --> 15:37.335
Oh, god!

15:37.337 --> 15:40.338
Oh, my -- I'm --

15:40.340 --> 15:43.274
Oh, my god.
Mom's the villain.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.109
I'm gonna win an emmy.

15:45.111 --> 15:46.411
[ crying ]
I'm in a bad way.

15:46.413 --> 15:47.946
Bow!

15:50.282 --> 15:53.117
I'm buttoning up,
so get off of me.

15:53.119 --> 15:54.953
All right,
let me make you some coffee.

15:54.955 --> 15:57.188
Uh, where do you keep
your cubed ham?

15:57.190 --> 16:00.325
Two fire extinguishers
and no ham.

16:00.327 --> 16:01.726
I mean,
that's just crazy.

16:01.728 --> 16:03.061
Charlie,
can you give us a moment?

16:03.063 --> 16:05.964
You better not
let it burn.

16:05.966 --> 16:08.132
What?!
[ scoffs ]

16:08.134 --> 16:09.600
What is going on with you?

16:09.602 --> 16:14.305
Dre, why were you trying to take
me down during "I never"?

16:14.307 --> 16:16.307
Because when I found out
you got dumped,

16:16.309 --> 16:18.209
I needed to know
how dumped you were.

16:18.211 --> 16:20.712
Who knew the depths
of your dumped-ness?

16:20.714 --> 16:24.115
[ sighs ]
hey, have you<i> ever</i> ended
a relationship?

16:24.117 --> 16:25.450
I'm about to.

16:25.452 --> 16:27.118
Look, I know I acted crazy,

16:27.120 --> 16:29.721
But I always saw you as this
brilliant heartbreaker,

16:29.723 --> 16:33.091
That these dudes
told you to kick rocks.

16:33.093 --> 16:37.228
You know, I didn't have it all
together when I was in college.

16:37.230 --> 16:40.064
And maybe it's obnoxious, but
invited these people over here

16:40.066 --> 16:42.266
So they could see how great
my life turned out for me.

16:42.268 --> 16:44.068
And now they think
I'm a lunatic!

16:44.070 --> 16:45.703
They might also think you have
a drinking problem.

16:45.705 --> 16:48.706
