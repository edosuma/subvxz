WEBVTT

00:07.758 --> 00:09.373
Where you at, boy?

00:09.594 --> 00:10.629
Hale!

00:13.097 --> 00:13.631
Where's Dyson?

00:13.848 --> 00:14.928
Una Mens still have him.

00:15.141 --> 00:17.382
Security is full throttle,
no one's getting in.

00:17.602 --> 00:19.968
I took a punch to
the neck. By a monk.

00:20.188 --> 00:22.270
Aw, Baby.

00:22.481 --> 00:23.186
Oh, wow, okay.

00:23.399 --> 00:24.605
Our key to getting to Dyson.

00:24.817 --> 00:26.648
If we can get him to talk.

00:28.863 --> 00:29.443
Informant.

00:29.655 --> 00:30.906
For my sex worker case.

00:31.115 --> 00:33.026
What, you guys have never played
"Capture The Monk" before?

00:33.242 --> 00:36.234
Spice it up,
thirty ninth division!

00:38.289 --> 00:40.575
Why take only Dyson
when we both broke Fae law

00:40.791 --> 00:43.453
by sleeping together?!

00:43.669 --> 00:45.921
What's with the no-glow?!

00:46.130 --> 00:47.085
Must be a eunuch.

00:47.298 --> 00:48.504
You mean--?

00:48.716 --> 00:51.879
Mmmhmm. Not even beach
volleyball would do it for 'em.

00:52.094 --> 00:54.176
Looks like I'm gonna have to do
this here the old fashioned way.

00:54.388 --> 00:56.504
Yea boyeeee. Get 'em.

00:56.724 --> 01:01.218
I'm gonna ask questions
and you're gonna have answers.

01:02.021 --> 01:04.979
Who is representing
Dyson at his trial?!

01:05.650 --> 01:07.641
(whimpering)

01:07.860 --> 01:11.102
Oh I'm sorry, was
that too loud for you?

01:12.406 --> 01:14.692
You ever meet a Siren before?

01:16.494 --> 01:18.030
Start talking or...

01:18.246 --> 01:19.702
(whistle)

01:19.914 --> 01:20.699
Oppilo!

01:20.915 --> 01:21.495
English.

01:21.707 --> 01:22.696
Please.

01:22.917 --> 01:24.623
Talk fast.

01:24.835 --> 01:27.702
There is no trial.
There is execution.

01:27.922 --> 01:29.628
For sleeping with Dark Fae?!

01:29.840 --> 01:31.376
For treason.

01:31.592 --> 01:36.882
In 1899, the Wolf murdered
humans and Fae in cold blood.

01:40.268 --> 01:41.223
I don't care how
long he's been alive,

01:41.435 --> 01:42.220
that is not Dyson.

01:42.436 --> 01:43.471
Yeah.

01:44.146 --> 01:45.727
Now you tell your monks
to clear the way so we can

01:45.940 --> 01:47.976
get to The Keeper and
Funky Bunch. Let's go.

01:48.192 --> 01:50.729
Convertimini ad nihilum.

01:55.992 --> 01:56.981
Loyal little shit.

01:57.201 --> 01:58.782
Latin is a dead language.

01:58.995 --> 02:01.407
Well what are our other
options? What about Trick?

02:01.622 --> 02:03.408
Nah, They won't
grant him audience.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.660
Una Mens have him
on acting Ash duty.

02:05.876 --> 02:08.003
Well there has to be
something that we can do.

02:08.212 --> 02:09.201
Come on, Worry Watsons.

02:09.422 --> 02:12.960
They're not actually
going to kill D-Man...

02:13.175 --> 02:14.790
Are they?

02:18.014 --> 02:20.721
I'm begging you. You have
the wrong scavenger.

02:20.933 --> 02:24.266
Mortis. lnvenio. ln unitate.

02:24.478 --> 02:27.436
You have failed to abide by
the sacred rules of the Fae.

02:27.648 --> 02:30.105
If you have any last
words, speak them now.

02:30.318 --> 02:39.067
No. Please, don't. No.
Please, please don't. No.

02:54.884 --> 02:57.717
Life is hard when you
don 't know who you are.

02:57.928 --> 03:00.635
It's harder when you
don 't know what you are.

03:00.848 --> 03:03.555
My loves carries
a death sentence.

03:03.768 --> 03:08.637
I was lost for years.
Searching, while hiding.

03:08.856 --> 03:09.811
Only to find out
that l belonged to

03:10.024 --> 03:12.857
a world hidden from humans.

03:13.069 --> 03:14.559
I won 't hide anymore.

03:14.779 --> 03:17.270
I will live the life I choose.

03:23.621 --> 03:24.986
How much time do we have?

03:25.206 --> 03:27.663
An hour. Five minutes.
I don't know.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.706
Thank you for coming.

03:29.919 --> 03:30.874
Of course I came.

03:31.087 --> 03:32.918
But I don't know, lately.

03:33.130 --> 03:34.711
I mean, you're with
the Dark. Dyson's Light.

03:34.924 --> 03:36.255
Dyson's family.

03:36.467 --> 03:39.254
I've saved him before,
I'd do it again.

03:39.470 --> 03:40.835
How did this happen?

03:41.055 --> 03:44.092
They caught us while we were--

03:44.308 --> 03:46.674
What?

03:46.894 --> 03:49.852
Oh. I get the picture.

03:50.064 --> 03:52.350
So! You and The Morrigan
are getting close.

03:52.566 --> 03:53.681
| see Kenzi reported back.

03:53.901 --> 03:54.606
No, it's not that.

03:54.819 --> 03:55.854
It's just that you
have all this equipment.

03:56.070 --> 03:57.651
Does she know
it's to save Dyson?

03:57.863 --> 03:59.945
I don't know. I don't
ask. I just take.

04:00.157 --> 04:02.773
It's sort of a think Dark
to be Dark kinda thing.

04:03.828 --> 04:05.489
Oh. Hello.

04:05.704 --> 04:06.614
Sorry.

04:06.831 --> 04:07.866
Don't be.

04:08.082 --> 04:11.040
How heartwarming.
What's next, soy candles?

04:11.252 --> 04:12.708
A little Tegan and Sara?

04:12.920 --> 04:15.536
Let's go! I've got places
to be, people to channel.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.496
An Oracle's time
isn't cheap, you know?

04:17.716 --> 04:19.252
Yeah, Cassie. We know.

04:19.468 --> 04:21.424
Trick pulled serious
strings to get you here.

04:21.637 --> 04:23.548
He's owes me like, infinity.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.049
Surprised he intervened.

04:25.266 --> 04:27.848
He gets caught,
they execute him too.

04:28.060 --> 04:29.220
So what's the plan?

04:29.437 --> 04:31.223
You need to get me
into Dyson's memory.

04:31.439 --> 04:33.475
He's been framed for a
billion-year-old murder.

04:33.691 --> 04:35.227
And l have to
prove he's innocent.

04:35.443 --> 04:36.649
For a second there I thought
you were gonna ask me to

04:36.861 --> 04:40.399
look into that gaping
black hole in your memory.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.400
Impossible... Even for me.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.572
You can see it?

04:44.785 --> 04:47.743
You know, after our
reading a few years back,

04:47.955 --> 04:50.412
I thought you might be
"The One". The unaligned

04:50.624 --> 04:54.412
Succubus, fighting to lead
the Fae into a new era...

04:54.628 --> 04:56.038
Guess not.

05:01.302 --> 05:03.088
The final element.

05:03.304 --> 05:05.386
Are you shizering me?
The Red String of Fate?

05:05.598 --> 05:07.554
Y-You might as well
lobotomize Bo right now!

05:07.766 --> 05:10.348
Do you have a better
idea? Dyson's remote.

05:10.561 --> 05:12.426
It's the only way.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.728
According to legend
the gods used to wrap this

05:14.940 --> 05:16.771
around the ankles of
those destined to meet.

05:16.984 --> 05:19.646
Regardless of time,
place, or circumstance.

05:19.862 --> 05:22.399
It'll secure your connection
to Bo and to Dyson.

05:22.615 --> 05:24.446
I'll stay here; the constant.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.694
Well that's beautiful,
Doctor Lewis.

05:26.911 --> 05:28.196
You are gonna go
into Dyson's memory,

05:28.412 --> 05:30.152
but your subconscious
will stay present.

05:30.372 --> 05:31.953
You'll likely project
familiar places

05:32.166 --> 05:34.828
and people that you
know into Dyson's past.

05:35.044 --> 05:36.784
Spoiler alert: I'll
make an appearance.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.086
And when I do,
it's time to get out.

05:39.298 --> 05:41.129
Or risk fusing your
memories with Dyson's.

05:41.342 --> 05:42.377
Meaning?

05:42.593 --> 05:44.504
You'll go clinically insane.
I've seen it happen.

05:44.720 --> 05:47.302
It's permanent.
And not pretty.

05:47.515 --> 05:50.598
You're putting yourself
in major danger here, Bo.

05:52.394 --> 05:54.646
Are you sure
you wanna do this?

05:54.855 --> 05:57.471
I would do the same for you.

05:59.527 --> 06:01.563
So now what?

06:01.779 --> 06:04.737
We wait for a
connection to Dyson...

06:21.215 --> 06:22.330
Shh.

06:22.550 --> 06:23.130
Keep washing him.

06:47.283 --> 06:50.320
Yes! Yes! Kenzi
did it, it's working!

06:50.536 --> 06:53.323
This is it. You're gonna
want to take a deep breath.

06:59.086 --> 07:00.371
C'est qui?

07:00.588 --> 07:03.705
Ouvre la Porte, Salir!

07:07.469 --> 07:08.925
Where is he?

07:10.055 --> 07:11.386
[BOTH] I love him!

07:20.357 --> 07:23.599
This opening is
too small for a man.

08:03.484 --> 08:04.644
Dyson, you handsome devil.

08:35.349 --> 08:36.464
(yell)

08:46.527 --> 08:49.564
My daughters. My
precious daughters.

08:49.780 --> 08:52.988
Precious, and
uh... Persuasive.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.360
You know as their
father, you should know--

08:54.576 --> 08:56.988
Don't you dare.

08:57.204 --> 09:01.538
My apologies. You
seem like a noble man.

09:01.750 --> 09:03.581
Your wife speaks
very highly of you.

09:03.794 --> 09:05.750
You know Isabelle?

09:08.173 --> 09:11.131
You have gone too far.

09:11.343 --> 09:13.584
I hope you enjoy hell.

09:13.804 --> 09:14.964
Excusez-moi?

09:15.180 --> 09:25.306
(fighting)

09:25.524 --> 09:27.185
A bo staff?

09:27.401 --> 09:30.359
That's unusual in
these parts, Monsieur?

09:30.571 --> 09:33.062
Follow me if
you want sanctuary.

09:35.492 --> 09:38.199
Does this
sanctuary serve ale?

09:40.914 --> 09:44.077
You have quite the
reputation. Thief. Con.

09:44.293 --> 09:45.749
Philanderer.

09:45.961 --> 09:47.076
You're proud of this?

09:47.296 --> 09:48.376
Tickled.

09:48.589 --> 09:50.955
Look, we both know
the French like to talk.

09:51.175 --> 09:54.087
Not just the French. You're
infamous throughout Europe.

09:54.303 --> 09:57.795
Okay, now... I'm proud.

09:58.015 --> 10:04.306
You're powerful, Dyson.
Capable of more. Of good.

10:13.822 --> 10:16.438
Alternately, your
robe smells like turnips

10:16.658 --> 10:19.491
and I'm late for a rendez-vous
with a farmer's wife.

10:19.703 --> 10:21.910
So farewell, crazy.

10:22.122 --> 10:25.239
You will listen! The Helskér!

10:27.503 --> 10:30.620
The ancient Hel-shoes, sought
after by the most powerful Fae.

10:30.839 --> 10:32.420
Including The
One Who Wanders...

10:32.633 --> 10:36.217
I've heard the tales.
Wars waged. Blood shed.

10:36.428 --> 10:38.919
They can only be worn
by The Worthy Hero.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.300
It is rumored that a
Prince has uncovered them.

10:41.517 --> 10:43.132
Selling them to
the highest bidder.

10:43.352 --> 10:46.719
You must intercept them before
they fall into the wrong hands.

10:46.939 --> 10:50.773
It is said that they
can lead to the end of days.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.520
What do I get?

10:54.738 --> 10:55.853
What do you want?

10:56.073 --> 10:57.062
Francs.

10:57.282 --> 10:59.944
What do you really want?

11:01.495 --> 11:03.611
Who are you?

11:06.458 --> 11:09.370
Fitzpatrick McCorrigan.

11:09.586 --> 11:15.252
Thanks for the tip
on the shoes... Trick.

11:18.220 --> 11:22.714
Shoes... Shoes.

11:22.933 --> 11:25.720
Milkmaids.

11:25.936 --> 11:27.551
Boobs

11:29.857 --> 11:32.894
It's good to know
Dyson was an intellectual.

11:33.110 --> 11:35.442
Hel-Shoes.

11:35.654 --> 11:37.610
Bo staff!

11:37.823 --> 11:42.066
Trick. Trick.

11:42.286 --> 11:44.277
It's a non-sequitur party,
and we're all invited.

11:44.496 --> 11:47.488
Bo, you are not
making any sense.

11:47.708 --> 11:50.199
He who wanders.

11:50.419 --> 11:54.583
What? What was that?
What was that?

11:54.798 --> 11:57.335
Helskér.

11:57.551 --> 12:00.543
What else-- What else about
the The Wanderer, Bo? Come on.

12:02.973 --> 12:04.588
Boobs

12:06.727 --> 12:09.844
Okay. Boobs it is.

12:16.069 --> 12:19.687
Enter on your feet
and leave on a cloud!

12:19.907 --> 12:22.865
Bienvenue au Cabaret Du Ciel!

12:23.076 --> 12:24.327
Heavenly.

12:24.536 --> 12:26.993
You have entered a place
where dreams come true,

12:27.205 --> 12:29.947
outside of time and space.

12:30.167 --> 12:36.379
Grab a beverage.
Grab an angel.

12:36.590 --> 12:38.501
It is time to fly!

12:38.717 --> 12:39.752
Where's my drink?

12:39.968 --> 12:45.088
Oh, Connard. You take
all the fun out of my job.

12:56.902 --> 13:00.895
Memory glitch much?

13:01.281 --> 13:03.397
That doesn't make any sense...

13:06.036 --> 13:08.823
Everyone seems to want a
piece of Le Prince tonight.

13:09.039 --> 13:11.746
Especially face over there.

13:11.959 --> 13:12.948
What a charmer.

13:13.168 --> 13:15.580
Calls himself Crater.
Here on "business".

13:15.796 --> 13:19.539
An Angel with her ear
to the ground. Go on...

13:19.758 --> 13:23.421
Traveling Prince. Great
fortune. Seeks excitement.

13:23.637 --> 13:28.222
Ignores la plus pas barmaid as
he awaits the main attraction!

13:28.433 --> 13:29.684
You know who?

13:29.893 --> 13:33.761
She does not attract
the crowd she used to, hm?

13:33.981 --> 13:36.097
They don't know
what they're missing...

13:36.316 --> 13:38.272
Get to her boudoire
before The Prince does...

13:38.485 --> 13:40.146
Vite! Showtime!

13:43.448 --> 13:45.780
Madames et Monsieurs...

13:45.993 --> 13:53.456
Let me present to you...
Madmoiselle Flora Blooms.

13:53.667 --> 14:03.542
(French singing)

14:03.760 --> 14:13.601
(French singing)

14:13.812 --> 14:33.620
(French singing)

14:33.832 --> 14:47.462
(French singing)

14:47.679 --> 14:50.341
Thanks subconscious.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.013
Subtle.

14:58.398 --> 15:01.765
Looks like Dyson's
enjoying it too.

15:01.985 --> 15:05.523
(French singing)

15:05.739 --> 15:10.859
No... No, no! Flora slash
Lauren isn't done singing yet.

15:11.078 --> 15:12.488
In French!

15:14.581 --> 15:16.367
He is an upstanding
citizen of this colony.

15:16.583 --> 15:17.823
A protector of The Light.

15:18.043 --> 15:22.036
And a murderer. He risked
revealing our kind to humans.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.632
The Wolf will be
killed for his crimes.

15:24.841 --> 15:28.208
As former Ash and
heir to the Zamora clan,

15:28.428 --> 15:32.171
may I remind you that Dyson
has fought for many lives.

15:32.390 --> 15:37.054
Helped defeat the Garuda.
Risked his life for our people!

15:37.270 --> 15:38.726
You have to consider.

15:38.939 --> 15:40.600
We consider.

15:45.153 --> 15:47.690
We refute. You are dismissed.

15:47.906 --> 15:51.239
Is this what you
call justice? Peace?

15:51.451 --> 15:54.909
I have enough with this fascism.
The Fae have had enough.

15:55.122 --> 15:59.741
Soon they will rise above.
And they will rule themselves!

15:59.960 --> 16:04.294
(cell phone ringing)

16:04.506 --> 16:07.589
Oops. I swear I
had it on vibrate.

16:07.801 --> 16:10.258
You have brought a
human into our chambers?

16:10.470 --> 16:14.179
Of your many insults,
this is the most galling.

16:14.891 --> 16:15.880
Kenzi.

16:16.101 --> 16:18.934
No, no, no! No, no! Una
Mens! Lock me up, not him!

16:19.146 --> 16:21.478
Proceed with The
Wolf's execution.

16:21.690 --> 16:23.772
And the human will join him.

16:29.030 --> 16:32.193
Come on, Bo. Figure out Dyson's
alibi and get out of there.

16:32.409 --> 16:34.400
You can do this...

16:36.496 --> 16:38.782
(sigh)

17:02.856 --> 17:05.017
It has been weeks.
Where have you been?

17:05.233 --> 17:06.188
You care?

17:06.401 --> 17:09.814
No. Of course I don't.

17:11.198 --> 17:13.234
You need to leave.

17:13.450 --> 17:15.566
Something is afoot
with our prince.

17:15.785 --> 17:19.869
Hence my heavy agenda of
scheming and stealing. Now go.

17:22.834 --> 17:26.122
This Prince carries
more than just coin.

17:30.300 --> 17:32.040
Go on...

17:32.260 --> 17:33.841
Helskér.

17:34.054 --> 17:36.420
C'est ridicule!
They don't exist.

17:36.640 --> 17:39.973
Or they do. And the Prince
is in posession of them.

17:40.727 --> 17:45.562
Imagine. Imagine how
much we could get for them.

17:45.774 --> 17:48.060
Thousands. Maybe more...

17:48.276 --> 17:50.858
You could finally hang up
your floral brassiere.

17:51.071 --> 17:52.902
Times are changing.

17:53.114 --> 17:54.615
It's the end of an era.

17:54.824 --> 17:56.735
Adieu, La Belle Epoque!

17:56.952 --> 17:59.113
You know the people don't
look at me like they used to.

17:59.329 --> 18:01.194
Oh now you're just
fishing. They adore you.

18:01.414 --> 18:05.032
Non. They see an illusion.
A cheap illusion.

18:05.252 --> 18:06.958
They don't really know me.

18:08.004 --> 18:12.418
But you know...
if we pull this off...

18:12.634 --> 18:18.129
I could return to my tree
of Gernika. To my grass.

18:18.348 --> 18:19.633
My meadow...

18:19.849 --> 18:22.682
You could buy back
your Basque forest...

18:22.894 --> 18:27.479
This Cabaret will miss
having a Leshii Fae around.

18:27.691 --> 18:31.900
They can find another woodland
spirit to seduce the rich.

18:32.779 --> 18:36.146
This is my way out.

18:36.366 --> 18:41.656
But you know...
I might miss the perks.

18:41.871 --> 18:45.910
Is that what I
am to you? A perk?

18:46.126 --> 18:49.584
Well. Since you came with the
tip, we'll split the profits.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.252
Fifty-fifty.

18:51.464 --> 18:52.089
And then we'll flee together

18:52.299 --> 18:54.665
so I can protect
you on your travels.

18:54.884 --> 18:57.796
I don't need your protection.

18:58.013 --> 19:03.508
But if you want to join
me, explore my land...

19:34.674 --> 19:44.470
(moaning and heavy breathing)

19:44.684 --> 19:54.355
(moaning and heavy breathing)

19:54.569 --> 20:04.820
So this is happening. For...
Investigative purposes. Right?

20:05.038 --> 20:06.198
Right.

20:11.169 --> 20:11.919
Your breathing is irregular.

20:12.128 --> 20:13.664
Heart rate is
increasing slightly.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.836
What are you seeing in there?

20:18.218 --> 20:19.458
Really? Chocolate spread?

20:19.677 --> 20:21.804
You couldn't have peanut
butter like everybody else?

20:22.013 --> 20:23.173
Lauren...

20:23.390 --> 20:26.052
Yes? Hi! I'm here!
I'm here. Hi.

20:26.267 --> 20:32.354
Lauren. Oh Lauren--

20:32.565 --> 20:33.896
Wow. Even in
Dyson's subconscious

20:34.109 --> 20:35.189
you're thinking of me?

20:35.402 --> 20:38.018
Score one for the doctor.

20:38.238 --> 20:40.854
Unless that's...
Dyson talking?

20:41.074 --> 20:47.912
Ninety eight, ninety
seven, ninety six.

20:48.123 --> 20:49.454
That can't be good.

20:49.666 --> 20:51.031
(knocking)

20:51.251 --> 20:52.536
Who is it?

20:52.752 --> 20:54.913
It is I, the prince!

20:55.130 --> 20:56.040
You have to hide.

20:56.256 --> 20:57.541
Signal if you need me.

20:57.757 --> 20:58.712
I can handle this.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.881
You don't wanna
give me a safe word?

21:01.094 --> 21:02.880
Oui: Back off.

21:03.096 --> 21:07.510
Cherie!

21:13.731 --> 21:17.223
Why, hello Prince Filipe.
Should I bow, or--

21:17.444 --> 21:18.775
Please.

21:19.904 --> 21:22.987
Allow me to introduce myself.

21:23.199 --> 21:24.905
I am Prince Filipe the third.

21:25.118 --> 21:27.074
I have traveled from Castille

21:27.287 --> 21:29.903
to make your
delectable acquaintance.

21:30.123 --> 21:32.580
You have come from so far.

21:32.792 --> 21:36.034
Let me lighten your load.

21:36.254 --> 21:39.417
What do you
fancy, Prince Filipe?

21:41.801 --> 21:45.168
You do not waste time.

21:45.388 --> 21:48.801
Time is a game played
beautifully by children.

21:49.017 --> 21:49.802
I hate children.

21:50.018 --> 21:53.226
Hmmm... Wise man.

21:53.438 --> 21:55.724
Let's begin.

21:55.940 --> 21:57.146
A blindfold?

21:57.358 --> 22:00.646
Please, I have came so far
to see your petals in bloom.

22:00.862 --> 22:03.274
Oh and you will, you will.

22:06.367 --> 22:12.909
The unknown... can also
be so... titillating.

22:18.087 --> 22:21.921
What do you
think you are doing?

22:22.133 --> 22:23.634
Foreplay?

22:23.843 --> 22:27.756
You should not touch what
doesn't belong to you...

22:27.972 --> 22:31.135
(pOW)

22:31.351 --> 22:32.887
I had him.

22:33.102 --> 22:35.184
A thank you would suffice.

22:35.396 --> 22:38.308
Thank you. But now we have
concussed royalty on our hands.

22:38.525 --> 22:39.935
His soldiers--

22:40.151 --> 22:41.015
They only need to
be told that he is

22:41.236 --> 22:43.227
resting after
his long voyage.

22:43.446 --> 22:44.982
And his night with you.

22:45.198 --> 22:46.654
What if they search us?

22:46.866 --> 22:48.982
They won't think twice
to look at your feet.

22:49.202 --> 22:50.317
(knocking)

22:50.537 --> 22:51.242
Open!

22:51.454 --> 22:52.739
C'est qui?

22:52.956 --> 22:54.571
I seek the Prince.

22:54.791 --> 22:56.747
Uh, he's umm...
occupied at the moment!

22:56.960 --> 22:58.245
Help me get them on!

22:58.461 --> 22:59.746
Perfect fit. Let's go.

23:02.715 --> 23:03.795
Your eyes--

23:04.008 --> 23:09.799
Now's not a time for
compliments, we have to...

23:10.014 --> 23:14.508
Dyson. It burns...

23:14.727 --> 23:17.389
I have been denied.

23:17.605 --> 23:20.893
The Helskor are
not intended for me.

23:21.109 --> 23:21.393
(knocking)

23:21.609 --> 23:23.224
Open.

23:26.030 --> 23:27.861
They won't come off!

23:28.074 --> 23:33.194
(knocking continues)

24:02.442 --> 24:04.728
Those are some efficient
monks. Didn't miss an inch!

24:04.944 --> 24:06.275
I wasn't gonna
say anything, but--

24:06.487 --> 24:09.024
Hey, I crawled through a sewer
to rescue your sweet hiney.

24:09.240 --> 24:10.070
So don't even.

24:10.283 --> 24:13.025
Clever. Masking your scent.

24:13.244 --> 24:14.859
Yeah.

24:19.083 --> 24:22.416
I'm glad you're here. At
least now I won't be bored.

24:22.629 --> 24:25.996
Imminent death? Hair-frizzing
humidity? What a snoozefest.

24:26.215 --> 24:27.796
It's kinda like a day off.

24:28.009 --> 24:30.796
It's nice to just sit around
and wait to be saved for once.

24:31.012 --> 24:34.755
Are you not even
a little scared?

24:34.974 --> 24:37.590
What I am is impressed.

24:37.810 --> 24:40.893
That you managed to get in
here without getting caught.

24:41.105 --> 24:43.938
When we do get out of here,

24:44.150 --> 24:46.311
I think it's time
I start training you.

24:46.527 --> 24:47.277
For what?

24:47.487 --> 24:49.443
To be a Shadow Thief.

24:49.656 --> 24:51.192
A Shadow-wha?

24:51.407 --> 24:52.783
Interested?

24:52.992 --> 24:55.199
Yeah, it sounds like
a freakin' Xbox game.

24:55.411 --> 24:58.244
First task: lose the ringtone.

24:58.456 --> 25:01.414
Oh, no. No, I'm out.
Can't do that.

25:06.673 --> 25:10.541
I can feel Bo.
She's in my memories.

25:10.760 --> 25:12.967
Worried about
what she'll find?

25:13.179 --> 25:17.764
Let's just say when you've
lived as long as I have...

25:17.975 --> 25:19.511
I've got regrets.

25:23.981 --> 25:28.350
D, did you actually
murder someone?

25:28.569 --> 25:31.527
It's a long story.

25:31.739 --> 25:35.948
Believe it or not, it
starts with a pair of shoes.

25:36.160 --> 25:39.869
Sounds like
my kind of story...

25:40.081 --> 25:41.491
Yeah.

25:41.708 --> 25:52.835
(bell tolling)

25:53.052 --> 25:57.216
Flora did all this.
Why is Dyson being blamed?

25:57.432 --> 26:01.300
Fifty five, fifty
four, fifty three.

26:01.519 --> 26:05.512
It stinks in here!
Dear period France: wash.

26:05.732 --> 26:07.848
Time's almost up. You
need to cut the string,

26:08.067 --> 26:10.854
you're the only
one who can do it.

26:13.364 --> 26:14.865
What's with the coach?

26:15.074 --> 26:16.359
Your memories are
fusing with Dyson's.

26:16.576 --> 26:17.861
You need to listen to me.

26:18.077 --> 26:19.533
No, I don't have
enough information yet.

26:19.746 --> 26:21.907
I have to find out
why he's being framed.

26:22.123 --> 26:26.207
If you stay, you're dumb!
But damn it, I'm impressed.

26:26.419 --> 26:28.080
You have lasted longer
in someone's memory

26:28.296 --> 26:29.706
than anyone I've ever seen.

26:29.922 --> 26:31.298
(scream)

26:31.507 --> 26:32.371
Then help me!

26:34.969 --> 26:36.470
And... something else.

26:36.679 --> 26:38.340
Something new.

26:38.556 --> 26:42.515
You sure you want to
sacrifice it all for a wolf?

26:42.727 --> 26:44.342
I have to try.

26:50.026 --> 26:55.441
Eleven, ten, nine, eight...

27:03.831 --> 27:10.498
Three, two, one.

27:10.713 --> 27:11.077
They're real.

27:11.297 --> 27:12.332
What? What's real?!

27:12.548 --> 27:14.288
Do you know what kinda
danger this puts me in?!

27:14.509 --> 27:16.591
I never wanted to
see any of this shit!

27:16.803 --> 27:17.588
Wait, wait. What about Bo?

27:17.804 --> 27:18.919
I tried tapping her out.

27:19.138 --> 27:20.753
What? She stayed?

27:20.973 --> 27:23.259
Yeah. When she wakes up, one:
get the straight jacket ready.

27:23.476 --> 27:25.467
Two: You're all dead
cause of those shoes.

27:25.686 --> 27:28.268
What shoes? You have
to go back in and get her!

27:28.481 --> 27:29.846
I already cut my string.

27:30.066 --> 27:31.897
Get. In. Bed. Trick--

27:32.109 --> 27:34.646
Can suck my left tit.

27:35.738 --> 27:39.902
Look, whatever you do, don't cut
the Red String of Fate yourself.

27:40.117 --> 27:41.527
'Kay?

27:44.622 --> 27:47.204
Blood.

27:47.416 --> 27:49.543
So much blood...

27:57.844 --> 28:02.258
Flora. You don't
want to do this.

28:02.473 --> 28:05.590
Can't stop.

28:05.810 --> 28:07.971
I won't stop.

28:08.187 --> 28:15.980
(fighting noises)

28:16.195 --> 28:17.810
I don't want to hurt you.

28:18.030 --> 28:21.568
Well that's no fun. Because
I want to hear you whimper.

28:21.784 --> 28:24.070
Please. For me?

28:24.287 --> 28:33.332
(more fighting sounds)

28:33.546 --> 28:36.663
(snarling)

28:39.093 --> 28:41.379
What have I done?

28:41.596 --> 28:45.509
It's not you. It's the shoes.

28:45.725 --> 28:49.513
All the darkest parts
of myself... All of them.

28:49.729 --> 28:51.811
Here. Now.

28:52.023 --> 28:54.264
We're gonna
get you out of this.

28:54.483 --> 28:56.690
They won't come
off. They can't.

28:56.903 --> 28:58.063
They have to.

28:58.279 --> 29:01.988
I didn't want to hurt anyone.
I didn't want to hurt you.

29:02.199 --> 29:06.613
I'll fix this. Flora,
stay with me. Stay with me!

29:06.829 --> 29:09.741
I love you.

29:09.957 --> 29:15.543
No you don't.
My love is the forest.

29:15.755 --> 29:17.370
And yours?

29:17.590 --> 29:20.548
I have a feeling that
yours is yet to come.

29:20.760 --> 29:23.376
And when she does,
she will be--

29:23.596 --> 29:27.805
(gunshot)

29:32.605 --> 29:37.770
No, no Flora. Stay with me,
Flora. Stay with me.

29:39.070 --> 29:41.732
I think I liked it better when
you were muttering nonsense.

29:41.948 --> 29:44.155
What is going on?

29:45.451 --> 29:48.659
Come on. Wake up, Bo.

29:48.871 --> 29:51.112
Bo, wake up!

30:16.899 --> 30:18.435
Boy I hope you can see this...

30:25.533 --> 30:27.569
Because I'm coming in.

30:35.001 --> 30:35.831
No more bullets?

30:36.043 --> 30:37.544
A man with a
reputation like yours,

30:37.753 --> 30:40.039
everyone will
think it was you.

30:40.256 --> 30:40.790
No...

30:41.007 --> 30:43.919
Give me the shoes.

30:44.135 --> 30:45.420
What did you do?

30:45.636 --> 30:47.968
I was provided with
explicit instructions.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.922
Get shoes.
Whatever the cost.

30:51.142 --> 30:52.552
Now run.

30:52.768 --> 30:55.145
Like you have always done.
Leave the shoes behind.

30:55.354 --> 30:56.969
You killed her.

30:57.189 --> 31:00.807
Mortis. lnvenio. In unitate.

31:01.027 --> 31:03.143
You don't care
about this woman.

31:03.362 --> 31:06.604
You have never cared
about anyone but yourself.

31:06.824 --> 31:10.817
Rotterdam 1864,
the fire at Boijmans.

31:11.037 --> 31:15.827
London 1817, your implication
in the Poyais scheme.

31:16.042 --> 31:20.001
The countless men you
conned, the women you shamed.

31:20.212 --> 31:20.997
Be quiet.

31:21.213 --> 31:24.171
You are a waste of flesh.

31:24.383 --> 31:27.921
All you've ever done
is steal and screw.

31:28.137 --> 31:31.425
And now your selfishness
has killed Flora.

31:31.640 --> 31:34.598
In fact, we were
counting on this.

31:37.563 --> 31:39.064
You're right.

31:39.273 --> 31:41.184
This is all my fault.

31:41.400 --> 31:44.483
Now you can resume
your life as it was.

31:46.322 --> 31:48.438
Go on.

31:48.657 --> 31:50.522
Run.

31:50.743 --> 32:00.539
3‘ ‘5

32:00.753 --> 32:07.795
3‘ ‘5

32:08.010 --> 32:09.921
[DYSON] "Go on. Run..."

32:10.137 --> 32:12.048
And for a second,
I considered it.

32:12.264 --> 32:13.424
Why? You were innocent.

32:13.641 --> 32:16.883
I wasn't. I did it.
I killed Flora.

32:17.103 --> 32:18.968
Crater shot her.

32:19.188 --> 32:21.725
I was the one who made
her put on those shoes.

32:21.941 --> 32:23.727
Because of me,
she killed those people.

32:23.943 --> 32:25.558
Because of me,
she was killed.

32:25.778 --> 32:27.143
Dyson. You didn't know.

32:27.363 --> 32:28.899
But I thought I did.

32:29.115 --> 32:33.324
My arrogance, my ignorance.
That was my crime.

32:33.536 --> 32:36.744
And now the past has
caught up with me, Kenzi.

32:39.041 --> 32:40.872
What happened next?

32:42.586 --> 32:45.248
CRATER:
Give me the shoes. Be free.

32:45.464 --> 32:47.750
If you think I'm gonna
let you and your masters,

32:47.967 --> 32:51.084
whoever they may be,
possess this sort of evil...

32:52.847 --> 32:59.059
If you want The Helskor, you're
gonna have to kill me first.

32:59.270 --> 32:59.554
(g rowls)

32:59.770 --> 33:01.010
[TRICK] Ha!

33:06.402 --> 33:09.769
Let me guess, you're
here for the shoes too?

33:09.989 --> 33:11.274
I never wanted them.

33:11.490 --> 33:13.355
I seek a second
for the New World.

33:13.576 --> 33:14.941
A second to whom?

33:15.161 --> 33:19.200
If you are interested, meet me
in my prayer room before dawn.

33:26.714 --> 33:30.707
| always imagined
I'd go motel pool-side.

33:30.926 --> 33:31.790
You know,
Twizzler in one hand,

33:32.011 --> 33:34.923
Liam Neeson in the other.

33:36.640 --> 33:38.141
You're shaking.

33:38.350 --> 33:43.219
Bo's greatest skill has never
been her punctuality, you know?

33:43.439 --> 33:47.102
The number of times she's left
me alone with a crazy client?

33:49.737 --> 33:52.774
But when it-- when it
matters, she always makes it.

33:52.990 --> 33:55.072
She always saves the day.

33:56.785 --> 33:58.195
Right?

34:00.706 --> 34:03.243
It's not over yet, Kenz.

34:08.464 --> 34:12.833
Mortis. lnvenio. In unitate.

34:13.052 --> 34:16.260
You have failed to abide by
the sacred rules of the Fae.

34:16.472 --> 34:18.804
If you have any last
words, speak them now.

34:19.016 --> 34:22.008
Ohgodohgodohgod.

34:22.228 --> 34:24.310
The human has
spoken for you, then.

34:24.521 --> 34:27.809
I just stole your last
words? Oh my god, I suck!

34:28.025 --> 34:32.268
Release the human and I
will give you The Helskér.

34:33.906 --> 34:35.021
Dyson, you can't do that.

34:35.241 --> 34:38.574
I couldn't save Flora.
But I can save you.

34:39.411 --> 34:41.276
After all these years,
why should we trust

34:41.497 --> 34:42.907
you know of their location?

34:43.123 --> 34:46.581
Because I have one
in my possession.

34:46.794 --> 34:52.039
Release Kenzi, and I will reveal
the location of the second.

34:52.258 --> 34:53.998
What did you just do?

35:00.516 --> 35:04.759
No one will ever
suffer again, as you did.

35:04.979 --> 35:10.144
I will hide the shoes. Somewhere
no one will ever look...

35:12.987 --> 35:14.602
Bo.

35:18.867 --> 35:20.949
No, it's not you. You died.

35:21.161 --> 35:22.492
I had to bury you!

35:22.705 --> 35:25.037
Bo, that's not me.
You're getting confused.

35:25.249 --> 35:25.999
No.

35:26.208 --> 35:27.664
Bo...

35:27.876 --> 35:30.083
Your memories are melding, Bo.

35:34.049 --> 35:40.261
Hey! What do you want?! What
are you trying to tell me?

35:40.472 --> 35:43.134
Dyson's championship belt?

35:43.350 --> 35:44.760
I don't know what that means!

35:44.977 --> 35:49.641
Bobo, you have to try this.
Fudgey nuts. Cold. Inyomouth.

35:49.857 --> 35:51.472
Kenzi.

35:54.361 --> 35:55.521
What is happening?

35:55.738 --> 35:58.104
You have to come back.

35:58.324 --> 36:00.656
You have to cut
your red string, Bo.

36:00.868 --> 36:03.450
You're gone. There's
nothing to come back for.

36:03.662 --> 36:08.156
There's Dyson. He needs you.

36:08.375 --> 36:16.293
Dyson... He's trying
to tell me something...

36:19.511 --> 36:21.126
I know--

36:27.353 --> 36:30.561
(gaSPS)

36:32.191 --> 36:33.772
Wha-- No no no no no no.

36:33.984 --> 36:35.360
A human can't be in there.

36:35.569 --> 36:38.902
Lauren! Lauren!

36:42.785 --> 36:46.744
Shit! Then how
do I get you out?

36:49.208 --> 36:51.324
Don't cut the string.

36:51.543 --> 36:52.874
Cut the string.

37:07.601 --> 37:14.689
Bo? Bo, I cut my string.

37:14.900 --> 37:18.563
Are you still you?

37:18.779 --> 37:20.735
Say something.

37:20.948 --> 37:22.904
I know how to save Dyson.

37:29.373 --> 37:33.332
They have checked your
location. There is no Helskor.

37:33.544 --> 37:36.081
Get a map, dweebs.
I just got to it first.

37:36.296 --> 37:39.504
Found it encased in your
framed championship belt.

37:39.716 --> 37:42.253
Also, wrapped in
your jock strap.

37:42.469 --> 37:43.754
It was clean.

37:43.971 --> 37:45.336
Stephen Hawking clever.

37:45.556 --> 37:48.673
Set Dyson and Kenzi free
and you get the stank shoe.

37:48.892 --> 37:52.885
Mortis invenio in unetate.

37:59.820 --> 38:03.312
You.

38:03.532 --> 38:06.820
if? 2

38:07.035 --> 38:07.990
(g rowls)

38:10.330 --> 38:16.166
You. You ordered Crater to get
the shoes. Whatever the cost.

38:16.378 --> 38:19.461
She is... more
than we expected.

38:19.673 --> 38:23.382
Glad you finally got the memo.

38:23.594 --> 38:27.837
Dyson is not guilty
of murder. You are.

38:34.646 --> 38:36.477
Now, do you
want the shoe or not?

38:41.737 --> 38:45.821
Mmm. This tastes
like warm squishy love.

38:46.033 --> 38:47.944
The hot dog or freedom?

38:48.160 --> 38:50.071
That was close. Too close.

38:50.287 --> 38:52.494
And I usually like
close. A close shave.

38:52.706 --> 38:54.992
Glenn Close. Close
Encounters of the Third Kind.

38:55.209 --> 38:56.494
Amen.

38:56.710 --> 38:57.460
You know what,
neurosurgery? I can do.

38:57.669 --> 38:59.660
Walking and eating?
I struggle with.

38:59.880 --> 39:01.666
You know not to get all
cheese-dog or anything,

39:01.882 --> 39:04.794
but guys, the gang
is all back together!

39:05.010 --> 39:08.047
Someone, somewhere tied a Red
String of Fate around all of us.

39:08.263 --> 39:09.639
Amen.

39:09.848 --> 39:10.132
You know, Bo,
according to legend,

39:10.349 --> 39:12.180
that's only intended
for two people.

39:12.392 --> 39:14.599
I don't care. It makes
me feel all fuzzy inside.

39:14.811 --> 39:16.517
Like we all belong together.

39:16.730 --> 39:18.971
Destiny only takes you so far.

39:19.191 --> 39:22.604
Actually staying
together takes work.

39:22.819 --> 39:25.435
You look damn cute
in that monk robe.

39:25.656 --> 39:29.023
Friar Tuck fetish? Hot!

39:29.243 --> 39:34.112
Oh... okay... Chew. Swallow.

39:34.331 --> 39:35.662
You're quiet.

39:37.834 --> 39:42.919
That was intimate.
You. In me for once.

39:43.131 --> 39:44.837
Such a way with words.

39:46.343 --> 39:48.254
I could feel you.

39:48.470 --> 39:52.713
Sent you a message
without even knowing it.

39:52.933 --> 39:54.844
I'm glad you got it.

39:55.060 --> 39:58.097
Our minds work well together.

39:58.313 --> 40:00.053
Yes they do.

40:00.274 --> 40:01.184
Hey D-man!

40:01.400 --> 40:03.561
What happened after
you buried Flora?

40:12.286 --> 40:14.277
I didn't think you'd come.

40:16.623 --> 40:19.035
I couldn't save her.

40:19.251 --> 40:20.957
You tried.

40:21.169 --> 40:23.125
Trying is not enough.

40:23.338 --> 40:25.203
Trying doesn't bring her back.

40:26.925 --> 40:28.256
I am worthless.

40:28.468 --> 40:29.218
No.

40:29.428 --> 40:32.511
You've just been... lost.

40:32.723 --> 40:34.338
And so have I.

40:34.558 --> 40:36.765
I don't want to fight anymore.

40:36.977 --> 40:41.266
NO more weapons, no more wars.

40:41.481 --> 40:43.972
We will start a Fae colony.

40:44.192 --> 40:46.274
A better life.

40:46.486 --> 40:49.148
A new start... together.

40:49.364 --> 40:50.399
Why me?

40:50.616 --> 40:52.402
You're pure of heart.

40:52.618 --> 40:54.984
A soldier. A shifter.

40:57.080 --> 40:57.944
You know?

40:58.165 --> 41:00.121
You served The King Alieach.

41:00.334 --> 41:01.494
Were betrayed.

41:01.710 --> 41:05.123
Broke free from your
pack. Went lone wolf.

41:10.344 --> 41:13.427
But we cannot do good alone.

41:14.848 --> 41:18.716
No matter how
powerful we may seem.

41:28.153 --> 41:29.768
Blood King...

41:32.157 --> 41:34.489
But you disappeared long ago.
Many think you're dead.

41:34.701 --> 41:37.784
I'd like to keep it that way.

41:37.996 --> 41:41.363
You are a hero, Dyson.
It is written.

41:41.583 --> 41:43.494
It's your destiny.

41:45.587 --> 41:47.418
Destiny is nothing
without action...

41:55.305 --> 41:57.045
I swear fealty
to you, Blood King.

42:02.396 --> 42:03.135
Well look how you turned out,

42:03.355 --> 42:05.437
saving our tight
butts all the time.

42:05.649 --> 42:07.230
Trick is the true savior.

42:07.442 --> 42:09.854
Not to me. Not lately.

42:10.070 --> 42:12.857
That's not fair. He doesn't know
about the mark on your chest.

42:13.073 --> 42:14.358
What mark on your chest?

42:15.826 --> 42:18.909
That's besides
the point. I mean...

42:19.121 --> 42:20.657
I'm done tip
toeing around this.

42:20.872 --> 42:23.909
He's the Blood King.
He's my grandfather.

42:24.126 --> 42:26.788
Why hasn't he helped me
figure out why I was taken?

42:27.003 --> 42:28.334
He's always trying
to protect you.

42:28.547 --> 42:31.254
Bullshit. He is
scared of something.

42:31.466 --> 42:34.082
I know you guys don't want to
admit it, but you've seen it!

42:34.302 --> 42:35.132
I know you have.

42:35.345 --> 42:39.384
The Shoes.
The One Who Wanders.

42:39.599 --> 42:42.432
Why didn't you or Trick tell
me about this connection before?

42:42.644 --> 42:44.384
Because I couldn't
remember it until now.

42:44.604 --> 42:47.391
Something blacked it out.

42:47.607 --> 42:52.567
Yeah well, there seems to
be a lot of that going around.

42:54.865 --> 42:57.607
We need to find The Wanderer.

42:57.826 --> 43:01.660
Find out why he
took me. Why I'm Dark.

43:01.872 --> 43:03.487
How are we getting to him?

43:03.707 --> 43:05.493
There's something he wants.

43:07.753 --> 43:12.463
Something that
he has always wanted.

43:12.674 --> 43:14.960
Dyson, where's that
second Hel-Shoe?

43:15.177 --> 43:16.758
I gave it to Angel.

43:16.970 --> 43:18.255
The bartender?

43:18.472 --> 43:20.929
And fellow shifter.

43:21.141 --> 43:24.759
I told her to flee.
Keep it hidden.

43:24.978 --> 43:27.094
Wait for the True Hero.

43:27.314 --> 43:29.726
Well I think we're
all done waiting.

43:32.027 --> 43:33.267
'Cause here I come.
