[theme music]

00:17.285 --> 00:18.152
Mommy.

00:18.186 --> 00:20.088
You're OK, sweetheart.

00:23.224 --> 00:24.024
Roseanne!

00:27.595 --> 00:29.563
Roseanne, where are you?

00:29.597 --> 00:31.031
I've got to tell you something!

00:31.065 --> 00:32.032
What?

00:32.066 --> 00:33.501
Where's my baby?

00:33.534 --> 00:35.969
We won the lottery!

00:36.003 --> 00:37.971
This is the winning
lottery ticket.

00:38.005 --> 00:39.140
I've got it right here.

00:39.173 --> 00:40.441
Remember you told me
to watch it on TV?

00:40.474 --> 00:41.909
What are you talking about?

00:41.942 --> 00:42.910
We won the lottery!

00:42.943 --> 00:44.878
I can't believe it!

00:44.912 --> 00:45.946
What lottery?

00:45.979 --> 00:48.716
The lottery, the
Illinois State Lottery.

00:48.749 --> 00:50.951
It's the biggest one in
the history of Illinois.

00:50.984 --> 00:53.053
It's $108 million!

00:53.087 --> 00:54.355
You mean-- you mean--

00:54.388 --> 00:59.327
We're the people that picked
the six winning numbers!

00:59.360 --> 01:00.461
Oh my god.

01:00.494 --> 01:05.499
You're telling me--
you're telling me--

01:05.533 --> 01:09.703
you're telling me that
we won the Illinois State

01:09.737 --> 01:11.139
Lottery which is $108 million?

01:11.172 --> 01:12.306
Is that what you're telling me?

01:12.340 --> 01:15.709
Is that what you're telling me?

01:15.743 --> 01:16.810
Let's tell Dan.

01:16.844 --> 01:18.179
No!

01:18.212 --> 01:19.880
Dan just had a heart attack
and this kind of thing

01:19.913 --> 01:20.781
could kill him.

01:20.814 --> 01:22.650
What's going on?

01:22.683 --> 01:24.818
Don't panic!

01:24.852 --> 01:26.320
What-- what's wrong?

01:26.354 --> 01:27.655
Nothing.

01:27.688 --> 01:28.556
Nothing is wrong.

01:28.589 --> 01:29.457
Nothing is wrong.

01:29.490 --> 01:30.491
Nothing ever be wrong again.

01:30.524 --> 01:33.394
Dan, Dan, I have
something to tell you.

01:33.427 --> 01:36.897
But before I tell you,
you have to promise me

01:36.930 --> 01:39.066
that you are not going
to collapse or turn

01:39.099 --> 01:42.370
blue or anything like that.
- Scout's honor.

01:42.403 --> 01:44.472
OK.

01:44.505 --> 01:48.909
We won the lottery!

01:48.942 --> 01:50.911
Oh my god!

01:50.944 --> 01:52.380
We won the lottery!

01:52.413 --> 01:55.349
We won the lottery!

01:55.383 --> 01:56.817
Oh my god.

01:56.850 --> 01:57.818
We won the lottery!

01:57.851 --> 01:59.220
We won the lottery!

02:03.857 --> 02:04.725
Hey!

02:04.758 --> 02:06.227
Hey!

02:06.260 --> 02:07.261
Go get my shirt.

02:11.632 --> 02:15.836
(SINGING) If what doesn't
kill us is making us stronger,

02:15.869 --> 02:21.175
we're gonna last longer than
that greatest Wall in China,

02:21.209 --> 02:24.144
or that rabbit with a drum.

02:24.178 --> 02:28.582
If there's one thing that
I learned while waiting

02:28.616 --> 02:33.487
for my turn, it's that in
each life some rain falls,

02:33.521 --> 02:36.457
but you also get some sun.

02:36.490 --> 02:41.395
And we'll make out
better than OK.

02:41.429 --> 02:43.864
Hear what I say.

02:43.897 --> 02:45.899
Yeah, any day.

03:01.582 --> 03:02.816
$108 million.

03:05.986 --> 03:07.087
Yeah, but you know what?

03:07.120 --> 03:09.790
If this ticket was worth
only, say, $10 million,

03:09.823 --> 03:12.526
I'd love it just as much.

03:12.560 --> 03:13.461
You know what?

03:13.494 --> 03:15.062
You guys should
have that framed.

03:15.095 --> 03:16.264
Yeah, we should.

03:16.297 --> 03:18.499
Duh, you have to turn it
in to get the money, Mark.

03:22.102 --> 03:25.205
I want you to know
that no one deserves

03:25.239 --> 03:27.908
this more than you and Dad.

03:27.941 --> 03:30.844
Aw.

03:30.878 --> 03:35.449
Oh, those are those pregnancy
hormones kicking in.

03:35.483 --> 03:36.984
Makes you so sweet.

03:37.017 --> 03:39.953
Too bad you didn't get
knocked up years ago.

03:39.987 --> 03:40.854
Wait.

03:40.888 --> 03:42.089
So I have it all figured out.

03:42.122 --> 03:44.525
You guys are going to
get $5.4 million a year.

03:44.558 --> 03:47.795
That's like $10 a
minute, $0.17 a second.

03:47.828 --> 03:48.696
Wow.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.831
That's $0.17.

03:50.864 --> 03:53.100
That's $0.17.

03:53.133 --> 03:55.235
That's $0.34.

03:55.269 --> 03:57.438
What are we going to do
with all the money, honey?

03:57.471 --> 03:59.840
I'll tell you what, we're
going to move out of here

03:59.873 --> 04:02.276
and buy that great big
house down the block--

04:02.310 --> 04:03.477
or better yet, wait.

04:03.511 --> 04:04.845
No.

04:04.878 --> 04:08.716
We're going to move to, uh,
the really nice part of town--

04:08.749 --> 04:09.550
or Egypt.

04:12.353 --> 04:15.022
This is our ancestral home.

04:15.055 --> 04:16.890
I grew up here.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.025
Don't worry, honey.

04:18.058 --> 04:20.394
We're not going to
get rid of the house.

04:20.428 --> 04:22.930
We'll just put it in the tree in
the backyard of our new place.

04:28.135 --> 04:29.503
You know what we can do?

04:29.537 --> 04:31.472
We're going to be able to
send Becky to the-- you know,

04:31.505 --> 04:33.874
the college that she wants
to go to, something really

04:33.907 --> 04:36.477
great like Harvard or, uh--

04:36.510 --> 04:39.313
uh, what's another college?

04:39.347 --> 04:40.247
Hey, thanks, Mom.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.281
Yeah.

04:41.315 --> 04:42.616
And DJ, you can just
go ahead and drop

04:42.650 --> 04:45.386
out of school altogether.

04:45.419 --> 04:46.587
No way.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.422
I mean, now that we've got
this all this dough I'm

04:48.456 --> 04:51.124
finally going to be popular.

04:51.158 --> 04:54.762
Well, I've always had
this dream that one day,

04:54.795 --> 04:58.432
I'd buy a vineyard
in Bordeaux and tease

04:58.466 --> 05:02.936
the nectar of the gods from
the heart of the grape.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.071
Why?

05:04.104 --> 05:08.241
That jug from Buying Bag
keeps you just as happy.

05:08.275 --> 05:10.444
I'm going to get all
new tools, finish by boat.

05:10.478 --> 05:11.745
You know what I'm
going to have mounted

05:11.779 --> 05:13.647
next to the captain's chair?
- What's that?

05:13.681 --> 05:14.782
The Liberty Bell--

05:14.815 --> 05:16.016
clang, clang, crack.

05:22.523 --> 05:23.757
I want to ride on
the space shuttle.

05:23.791 --> 05:24.592
Who's with me?

05:27.294 --> 05:30.731
Hey, you don't have to worry
about your health to your heart

05:30.764 --> 05:32.533
anymore, Dan, because we
can just buy one of them

05:32.566 --> 05:35.569
baboon heart transplant jobs.

05:35.603 --> 05:36.837
You know what?

05:36.870 --> 05:38.606
With the stuff they've got
going with medical science

05:38.639 --> 05:42.009
now, good god I'm getting
me a ton of plastic surgery.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.644
I swear to god.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.379
I'm getting one
of them nose jobs

05:45.413 --> 05:48.949
and I'm going to get a tummy
tuck and a ton of liposuction.

05:48.982 --> 05:51.852
Honey, I like you
just the way you are.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.587
Well, that don't matter
to me because I'm dumping

05:53.621 --> 05:55.055
you for some parasitic pig.

05:55.088 --> 05:57.124
Then I'm going to lose
him for some young guy

05:57.157 --> 05:58.559
that's really buff.
And then--

05:58.592 --> 05:59.460
Whoa.
Whoa.

05:59.493 --> 06:01.094
Whoa.
Whoa.

06:01.128 --> 06:03.764
Just slow down, everybody.

06:03.797 --> 06:06.166
We can't celebrate till we've
officially gotten the money.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.435
OK?

06:07.468 --> 06:11.705
Because I read about this
guy, he's an average guy,

06:11.739 --> 06:14.642
he's got a winning
lottery ticket.

06:14.675 --> 06:16.944
You know, he's whooping
it up, he figures

06:16.977 --> 06:18.512
he's already got the cash.

06:18.546 --> 06:21.915
Guess what, he lost the ticket.

06:21.949 --> 06:27.020
So on minute he's got millions,
the next minute nothing.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.321
Thanks for sharing that, sis.

06:28.355 --> 06:30.023
I'm just saying.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.893
I'm saying we've got to be
very, very careful here.

06:32.926 --> 06:34.327
I agree with Jackie.

06:34.361 --> 06:37.865
Don't do that, Mother.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.066
Oh, come on, Jackie.

06:39.099 --> 06:40.534
There's got to be
something you want.

06:40.568 --> 06:42.302
I'm not going to think
about it until that ticket

06:42.335 --> 06:43.270
goes down to that office.

06:43.303 --> 06:45.105
I know what Jackie wants.

06:45.138 --> 06:47.374
Vroom, vroom, vroom.

06:47.407 --> 06:51.378
Cherry red sports car with a
leather-wrapped steering wheel.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.345
And?

06:52.379 --> 06:55.348
And a Rolex.

06:55.382 --> 06:56.416
See, that wasn't so hard.

06:59.086 --> 07:01.421
You know they say that DeVry
Institute's a good college.

07:15.969 --> 07:17.471
Excuse me.

07:17.505 --> 07:22.009
If we were here to collect,
say, $108 million dollars,

07:22.042 --> 07:23.544
where would we go?

07:23.577 --> 07:25.212
Oh, you're the one, huh?

07:25.245 --> 07:27.147
You know I had two
of those numbers?

07:27.180 --> 07:29.950
Well, thanks for your dollar.

07:29.983 --> 07:31.852
You want the lottery director.

07:35.388 --> 07:38.225
Stay alert, my friend.

07:38.258 --> 07:39.827
Uh, hello.

07:39.860 --> 07:40.728
We're the Conners.

07:40.761 --> 07:41.762
We have an appointment.

07:41.795 --> 07:42.963
Oh, hello, hello.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.331
So this is the lucky couple.

07:44.364 --> 07:45.866
I'm Mr. Russo.

07:45.899 --> 07:47.200
Boy, I bet you're excited.

07:47.234 --> 07:48.502
We were up all night.

07:48.536 --> 07:51.539
So was I. you know, your
win, should it prove valid,

07:51.572 --> 07:54.775
will be the high point of my
prize disbursement career.

07:54.808 --> 07:57.410
Man, you guys
are so much nicer

07:57.444 --> 08:00.781
here than at the
unemployment office.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.182
Bernie, I took the
liberty of filling

08:02.215 --> 08:03.350
out the claim form here.
- Good.

08:03.383 --> 08:04.251
Good.

08:04.284 --> 08:05.152
Good.

08:05.185 --> 08:08.455
And thanks for pressing hard.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.558
Now I-- I'm going to have
to match the valediction

08:10.591 --> 08:11.458
number on your ticket.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.460
Yes, sir.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.896
Well, Dan, looks like we will
be going to our next high school

08:15.929 --> 08:17.731
reunion.

08:17.765 --> 08:19.232
All right.
Now I need some identification.

08:19.266 --> 08:20.133
Yes, sir.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.234
Absolutely.

08:21.268 --> 08:22.335
We are us.

08:22.369 --> 08:23.403
I didn't know what
to bring here.

08:23.436 --> 08:25.472
I've got the birth
certificate, license,

08:25.505 --> 08:28.709
social security number,
that's my fishing license.

08:28.742 --> 08:29.943
Yeah.

08:29.977 --> 08:33.080
And-- and that key card
there, that unlocks room 411

08:33.113 --> 08:35.883
at the Pine Tree Motor Lodge.

08:35.916 --> 08:38.552
Well, on behalf of
the state of Illinois,

08:38.586 --> 08:40.187
let me congratulate you.

08:40.220 --> 08:43.691
You have just won the largest
lottery in our history!

08:43.724 --> 08:45.559
Thank you, thank
you, thank you!

08:50.497 --> 08:51.832
I hope you folks
don't mind posing

08:51.865 --> 08:52.933
for a few publicity photos.

08:52.966 --> 08:55.068
Look at all the paparazzi.

08:55.102 --> 08:56.570
That guy's with the "Enquirer."

08:56.604 --> 08:58.038
Hey, I didn't know
the legitimate press

08:58.071 --> 08:59.306
was going to be here.
- All right.

08:59.339 --> 09:02.075
Now smile.

09:02.109 --> 09:03.877
All right, that's enough.
That's enough.

09:03.911 --> 09:05.579
Now, we're going to be
sending these photos along

09:05.613 --> 09:06.847
with a press release
so you're going

09:06.880 --> 09:08.381
to be bombarded by the media.

09:08.415 --> 09:09.717
Why?

09:09.750 --> 09:11.819
We didn't grow a squash that
looks like Dole or nothing.

09:14.487 --> 09:20.527
Hey, Mr. Russo, not to be
piggy or nothing, but, uh,

09:20.560 --> 09:22.830
when do we get the real check?

09:22.863 --> 09:23.964
Well, that'll be right along.

09:23.997 --> 09:25.899
It should take about
four or five weeks.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.100
Four or five weeks?

09:27.134 --> 09:28.468
Really?

09:28.501 --> 09:30.137
Well, we were going to take
the family out for ice cream.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.172
Now what the hell are
we supposed to do?

09:38.045 --> 09:39.046
Damn.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.948
I ain't never sen
this room so bright.

09:40.981 --> 09:42.215
Yeah.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.885
I think people who read
would really like this place.

09:44.918 --> 09:45.786
Hi.

09:45.819 --> 09:46.887
I'm Kathleen Sullivan.

09:46.920 --> 09:47.788
Hi.

09:47.821 --> 09:50.791
Uh, Rosanne and Dan.

09:50.824 --> 09:52.159
Congratulations.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.093
Take a seat.

09:53.126 --> 09:53.927
OK.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.532
Now, we'll just start
whenever you're comfortable.

09:59.566 --> 10:00.433
OK.

10:00.467 --> 10:01.769
Put this mic here on Mama.

10:04.404 --> 10:05.272
OK.

10:05.305 --> 10:06.907
Yeah.
OK.

10:06.940 --> 10:07.875
No. that feels funny.

10:11.144 --> 10:14.014
This is Kathleen Sullivan on
remote in America's heartland,

10:14.047 --> 10:18.686
Lanford, Illinois, where two
hardworking self-described

10:18.719 --> 10:21.621
regular folks have just
won the biggest lottery

10:21.655 --> 10:23.791
in Illinois state history.

10:23.824 --> 10:28.228
So Rosanne and Dan Conner,
how does it feel to be

10:28.261 --> 10:30.297
worth more than $100 million?

10:30.330 --> 10:34.034
Well, I feel like
a million bucks.

10:34.067 --> 10:35.368
I guess I've sold myself short.

10:41.008 --> 10:45.112
So tell us, you two lovebirds,
who are Rosanne and Dan?

10:45.145 --> 10:47.080
Well, we were born
in Lanford and--

10:47.114 --> 10:47.981
Yeah.

10:48.015 --> 10:49.850
We were born here in Lanford.

10:49.883 --> 10:52.419
High school sweethearts,
went to Lanford High School.

10:52.452 --> 10:53.653
And it was about 10th grade.

10:53.687 --> 10:54.755
10th grade.

10:54.788 --> 10:55.655
Played football.

10:55.689 --> 10:56.656
He played football.

10:56.690 --> 10:57.991
We met--
- Got married.

10:58.025 --> 10:59.626
- --and got married.
- Moved into this house.

10:59.659 --> 11:00.994
I put that linoleum
in there myself.

11:01.028 --> 11:02.930
He did all the work.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.531
And then we got the
knick-knacks and what not,

11:04.564 --> 11:05.933
put the art up.
- Yeah.

11:05.966 --> 11:06.834
And then here we.

11:06.867 --> 11:07.667
Here we are.

11:10.470 --> 11:11.905
Why don't we meet
the rest of the family?

11:11.939 --> 11:13.106
Oh, yeah.
Definitely.

11:13.140 --> 11:14.374
Kids, come on down.

11:14.407 --> 11:15.776
Come on in here.

11:15.809 --> 11:16.609
Come on!

11:20.480 --> 11:21.782
OK.

11:21.815 --> 11:26.253
This is our daughter, Darlene,
and her husband, David.

11:26.286 --> 11:29.790
They're-- they're vegetarians
so they don't have the strength

11:29.823 --> 11:33.293
to hold their heads up.

11:33.326 --> 11:36.596
And, uh, this is
our oldest daughter,

11:36.629 --> 11:38.398
Becky, and her husband, Mark.

11:38.431 --> 11:39.232
I'm Mark.

11:42.502 --> 11:45.472
And this is our son, DJ, and
our little baby, Jerry, here.

11:45.505 --> 11:46.373
Give me the baby.

11:46.406 --> 11:47.607
Give me the baby.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.309
[baby crying]

11:50.310 --> 11:51.478
What'd you do to him?

11:54.848 --> 12:00.754
And this is Mrs. Harris,
the woman who raised me.

12:00.788 --> 12:03.156
Hello, America.
Hello.

12:03.190 --> 12:04.391
And my sister, Jackie.

12:04.424 --> 12:05.292
I helped pick the numbers.

12:08.095 --> 12:12.499
So there you are, ladies and
gentlemen, the lucky family.

12:12.532 --> 12:14.935
So tell us, how do
you think the lottery

12:14.968 --> 12:17.204
is going to change your lives?

12:17.237 --> 12:18.605
Well, not much.

12:18.638 --> 12:20.640
We're probably just going to be
the same people we always were.

12:20.673 --> 12:21.474
Yeah, only happy.

12:32.252 --> 12:35.422
They ought to make
this caviar bigger.

12:35.455 --> 12:38.725
One jar barely fits
on one cracker.

12:38.758 --> 12:39.659
Wow.

12:39.692 --> 12:41.028
This is the first
party we've had

12:41.061 --> 12:45.265
where DJ wasn't in the bedroom
going through coat pockets.

12:45.298 --> 12:47.067
And that's the way it's
going to be from now on.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.569
More meat, son.

12:49.602 --> 12:50.938
This meat doesn't look right.

12:50.971 --> 12:52.906
I mean, where's all
the white shiny stuff?

12:55.642 --> 12:57.444
This is lean meat, son.

12:57.477 --> 13:00.380
Our 22% days are over with.

13:00.413 --> 13:01.381
OK.

13:01.414 --> 13:03.150
I got the plastic
champagne glasses.

13:03.183 --> 13:04.885
Did you get the
expensive ones?

13:04.918 --> 13:08.321
$5.99 a dozen.

13:08.355 --> 13:11.825
DJ, run these
burgers out to Mark

13:11.859 --> 13:13.793
and I'm going to go
entertain our guests.

13:13.827 --> 13:15.195
[phone ringing]

13:16.263 --> 13:17.264
Hello.

13:17.297 --> 13:18.298
No.

13:18.331 --> 13:21.034
I'm sorry, we don't
have an Uncle Sid.

13:21.068 --> 13:23.370
Or an Uncle George.

13:23.403 --> 13:24.471
And no Charlie.

13:24.504 --> 13:25.672
Strike three, lunch meat.

13:28.641 --> 13:33.146
Man, brand names
are so colorful.

13:33.180 --> 13:36.416
Oh, you got champagne
and it's out of state.

13:39.419 --> 13:40.420
It's so incredible.

13:40.453 --> 13:42.589
I even went to that
fancy market today

13:42.622 --> 13:43.924
and for the first
time in my life,

13:43.957 --> 13:47.627
I didn't hold up the line
by paying with coupons.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.096
You paid full
price for everything?

13:49.129 --> 13:50.130
No, not everything.

13:50.163 --> 13:52.199
They threw in the
bottle of champagne

13:52.232 --> 13:54.201
for free because
they recognized me.

13:54.234 --> 13:55.302
No.

13:55.335 --> 13:56.569
It's so awesome.

13:56.603 --> 13:58.571
And then when Dan went
down to get the charcoal,

13:58.605 --> 14:00.874
the guy throws in a
hibachi and a free set

14:00.908 --> 14:02.442
of those kebab pokers.

14:06.713 --> 14:08.781
Wow, this pregnancy
thing really bites.

14:08.815 --> 14:10.918
I'm going to start crying again.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.452
Oh, that's nothing.

14:12.485 --> 14:14.121
Wait till you start
peeing when you laugh.

14:18.358 --> 14:19.426
Or sneeze.

14:19.459 --> 14:21.161
Yeah.

14:21.194 --> 14:24.431
Or Blank

14:24.464 --> 14:25.933
[phone ringing]

14:25.966 --> 14:26.866
I got this one.

14:29.802 --> 14:30.737
Hello?

14:30.770 --> 14:32.039
Uh-huh.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.173
No.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.942
I'm sorry, we've already
committed to a charity.

14:34.975 --> 14:37.477
We just bought 500 bottles of
Paul Newman salad dressing.

14:41.014 --> 14:43.316
Hey, Leon, come
on over here you

14:43.350 --> 14:45.185
help yourself to some caviar.

14:45.218 --> 14:48.188
You really did
win the lottery.

14:48.221 --> 14:53.093
I just had to come over and
see if my worst nightmare did

14:53.126 --> 14:55.963
come true, and in fact it has.

14:55.996 --> 15:01.734
So I am now in hell.

15:01.768 --> 15:03.136
Kill me.

15:03.170 --> 15:05.238
Well, I'm kind of
busy right now, Leon.

15:05.272 --> 15:07.074
But go on in the kitchen
and help yourself

15:07.107 --> 15:08.208
to what's ever under the sink.

15:11.778 --> 15:13.346
Roseanne, Roseanne,
Roseanne, I just

15:13.380 --> 15:15.848
can't get over your windfall.

15:15.882 --> 15:18.218
Well, I owe it
all to you, Mom.

15:18.251 --> 15:19.652
I mean, if you would
have encouraged

15:19.686 --> 15:21.521
me to do something
useful with my life,

15:21.554 --> 15:24.324
this never would have happened.

15:24.357 --> 15:25.925
Thank you, dear.

15:25.959 --> 15:28.661
And I want you to know
that all that money

15:28.695 --> 15:31.031
I lent you over the years--

15:31.064 --> 15:33.833
well, there's no need to
give it a moment's thought.

15:33.866 --> 15:34.968
Oh, I never have.

15:37.537 --> 15:38.805
Hey.

15:38.838 --> 15:40.573
There's a bunch of people
looking over the back fence

15:40.607 --> 15:42.642
trying to take our picture.

15:42.675 --> 15:43.576
Don't worry about it.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.145
They can't use any of it, man.

15:45.178 --> 15:47.880
I was mooning them and flipping
them the bird the whole time.

15:52.219 --> 15:53.853
What's going on around here?

15:53.886 --> 15:56.223
Well, you know the guy at
the prize office warned us

15:56.256 --> 15:57.524
this might happen.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.592
Hey, everybody,
it's time to toast Dan

15:59.626 --> 16:02.629
and Roseanne on
their great fortune.

16:02.662 --> 16:03.530
No, no, no, no.

16:03.563 --> 16:06.466
Please, allow me.

16:06.499 --> 16:11.638
To the Conners I say, and I
quote, to know what God thinks

16:11.671 --> 16:13.873
of money, one only
has to look at those

16:13.906 --> 16:15.275
to whom he has given it.

16:23.183 --> 16:25.485
Thanks, Leon.

16:25.518 --> 16:26.619
You guys have got to look.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.188
There's like over
100 people out there.

16:31.791 --> 16:34.227
Isn't it wonderful being rich?

16:34.261 --> 16:36.263
I've finally risen
above the people

16:36.296 --> 16:38.865
I long knew were my inferiors.

16:38.898 --> 16:43.470
I'm as giddy as a schoolgirl--
make that a private schoolgirl.

16:43.503 --> 16:44.671
OK, Mom.

16:44.704 --> 16:48.675
Time to go out and lay on
the lawn and take a nap.

16:48.708 --> 16:50.743
Boy, is this
causing a traffic jam.

16:50.777 --> 16:53.280
Well, I told you to take
those Christmas lights down.

17:01.588 --> 17:03.623
You know, Roseanne,
I was just thinking,

17:03.656 --> 17:06.025
you may have the pleasure
of winning all this money,

17:06.059 --> 17:09.696
but I will have the sheer
delight of watching you blow

17:09.729 --> 17:11.098
it all on collectible plates.

17:13.833 --> 17:16.169
Collectible plates
are in the past, Leon.

17:16.203 --> 17:22.775
The future is all about Star
Trek signature coffee mugs.

17:22.809 --> 17:25.612
Hey, hey, hey,
it's a great party.

17:25.645 --> 17:30.250
I forgot to mention, don't
spend it all in one place.

17:30.283 --> 17:31.184
OK.

17:31.218 --> 17:32.552
OK.

17:32.585 --> 17:35.588
Oh, pheasant-- that's what
this party needs, pheasant.

17:40.260 --> 17:41.894
Dan, can I see
you in the kitchen?

17:41.928 --> 17:42.795
Well, if--

17:42.829 --> 17:43.896
Now.

17:43.930 --> 17:46.533
Great talking to you
again, really great.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.000
Who in the hell was
I just talking to?

17:48.034 --> 17:50.170
I have no idea.

17:50.203 --> 17:53.005
Who are you?

17:53.039 --> 17:54.407
Man, honey, this is insane.

17:58.211 --> 18:02.615
Dan, how do you leave a
party when you're the host?

18:02.649 --> 18:04.584
You know, I think
technically if we

18:04.617 --> 18:07.954
went down to the basement, we
wouldn't be leaving the party.

18:07.987 --> 18:08.855
You're on.

18:08.888 --> 18:10.056
- Coming through.
- Gang way.

18:10.089 --> 18:10.890
Watch your back.

18:16.229 --> 18:17.630
Privacy.

18:17.664 --> 18:18.465
Sanctuary.

18:22.469 --> 18:24.171
Man, it's quiet in here.

18:24.204 --> 18:28.175
I hate hearing all these voices,
you know, unless they're mine.

18:28.208 --> 18:29.442
Yeah.

18:29.476 --> 18:32.412
I think the ringing in my
ears has finally stopped.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.814
It's the first time we've
been alone together all day.

18:34.847 --> 18:35.715
Yeah.

18:35.748 --> 18:37.350
Well, you know what?

18:37.384 --> 18:38.685
We could do a lot
more of that from now

18:38.718 --> 18:42.955
on, just hanging out together,
spend every single minute

18:42.989 --> 18:46.193
of the day get together.

18:46.226 --> 18:47.594
Uh, yeah.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.697
Well, you know, it's not
like we're going to have

18:50.730 --> 18:51.898
all that much down time.

18:51.931 --> 18:52.999
You know, we're
going to be doing

18:53.032 --> 18:55.302
a lot of-- a lot of
shopping, you know,

18:55.335 --> 18:58.205
going to a lot of movies, a
lot of plays, stuff like that.

18:58.238 --> 18:59.606
we'll travel.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.341
We could take one of
the Kathy Lee tours.

19:04.477 --> 19:07.847
Hey, I bet you we're
richer than her now.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.919
Boy, does that put
things into perspective.

19:15.488 --> 19:16.656
Man.

19:16.689 --> 19:18.858
So you know what we really
got to do, though, Dan?

19:18.891 --> 19:21.060
We have really got
to start taking better

19:21.093 --> 19:23.062
care of ourselves, you know.

19:23.095 --> 19:25.332
I mean, now that we got all
this money, I want to live.

19:27.667 --> 19:28.535
Yeah.

19:28.568 --> 19:30.370
Me, too.

19:30.403 --> 19:32.239
Uh, how do you go about
doing something like that?

19:32.272 --> 19:34.841
Well, see, I think we'll
get a nutritionist, you know,

19:34.874 --> 19:36.276
and they'll tell us what to eat.

19:36.309 --> 19:38.678
And then we'll haul in one
of them trainers, you know,

19:38.711 --> 19:43.250
and they'll just whip our
butts right into shape.

19:43.283 --> 19:44.284
Yeah.

19:44.317 --> 19:45.985
I could be buff in
a couple of months.

19:49.422 --> 19:50.423
Or 10 years, whatever.

19:53.393 --> 19:55.094
Man, it is just
amazing, isn't it?

19:55.127 --> 19:58.030
I mean, we're going to be
part of the whole hoity toity,

19:58.064 --> 20:00.600
hoopty do.

20:00.633 --> 20:03.135
Remember what I told you
when we started going out?

20:03.169 --> 20:05.338
Stick with me, kid, I'll have
you farting through silk.

20:13.380 --> 20:14.681
No matter what
happens, we're just

20:14.714 --> 20:16.716
going to be the same people--

20:16.749 --> 20:20.653
same old Dan and Roseanne.

20:20.687 --> 20:23.022
Sitting on a mountain of cash.

20:32.399 --> 20:35.635
Come with me, Robin Leach,
as we tour the home of the duke

20:35.668 --> 20:38.538
and duchess of good
fortune, lottery winners

20:38.571 --> 20:40.873
Dan and Roseanne Conner.

20:40.907 --> 20:43.576
Here is their
luxurious Lanford lair.

20:43.610 --> 20:48.781
The decor is a delightful
potpourri of American Baroque.

20:48.815 --> 20:52.251
The carpet is a beautiful
polyester fiber.

20:52.285 --> 20:55.087
It's no longer made
for health reasons.

20:55.121 --> 20:59.258
And this is the crown
jewel of our collection.

20:59.292 --> 21:01.428
And what a jewel it is.

21:01.461 --> 21:05.298
All wings of the house meet here
at the entertainment center,

21:05.332 --> 21:08.401
where Dan and Roseanne
relax after a long day

21:08.435 --> 21:12.138
of counting their lookah.

21:12.171 --> 21:16.743
We have all the
"Barnaby Jones" tapes.

21:16.776 --> 21:17.977
ROBIN LEACH: We
relax by watching

21:18.010 --> 21:19.579
an episode from season 3.

21:26.653 --> 21:29.055
As the day drew to
a close, Roseanne

21:29.088 --> 21:32.925
proved just why she's famous for
her hospitality from Manhattan

21:32.959 --> 21:34.093
to Marrakesh.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.829
Want a sandwich?

21:36.863 --> 21:38.465
ROBIN LEACH: No
lover of fine food

21:38.498 --> 21:40.333
could resist such an offer.

21:40.367 --> 21:45.538
I'm Robin Leach with beer
wishes and nacho dreams.
