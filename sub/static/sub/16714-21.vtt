00:00.125 --> 00:01.591
Previously, on “Criminal Minds”...

00:01.593 --> 00:03.638
I'd be happy to help
you with your mother.

00:03.794 --> 00:06.177
Thank you. You have no idea how
much this means to me, Cassie.

00:06.401 --> 00:09.836
Reid will not get hurt
in here again, ever.

00:09.838 --> 00:12.272
If he does, I'll make you suffer.

00:12.274 --> 00:14.574
I can take away a lot.

00:14.576 --> 00:17.077
I could take away your son.

00:17.079 --> 00:19.045
I need to walk you
through another cognitive.

00:19.047 --> 00:21.748
I hear a noise, like a spraying sound,

00:21.750 --> 00:23.249
and I feel a mist.

00:23.251 --> 00:24.918
Do you recognize who it is?

00:24.920 --> 00:27.588
It wasn't Scratch who framed me.

00:27.622 --> 00:29.189
It was a woman.

00:29.191 --> 00:31.391
I'm sorry. I should
have introduced myself.

00:31.393 --> 00:32.459
Carol Atkinson.

00:32.461 --> 00:34.197
I know you.

00:35.030 --> 00:36.029
You're Lindsey Vaughn.

00:36.031 --> 00:38.631
No. Carol.

00:38.633 --> 00:40.500
Carol Atkinson.

00:42.137 --> 00:43.570
Let's go, Diana.

00:45.540 --> 00:47.574
Time to go.

00:47.576 --> 00:49.075
Time to go.

00:49.077 --> 00:51.911
“Time to go.” It was a woman.

00:51.913 --> 00:53.947
Guard! Guard!

00:53.949 --> 00:56.716
Mom! Mom!

01:07.496 --> 01:09.763
I came as fast as I could.

01:09.765 --> 01:11.564
Thanks. I appreciate it.

01:11.566 --> 01:13.199
Why couldn't you tell me
on the phone? What happened?

01:13.201 --> 01:14.834
Fiona and I went to see Reid.

01:14.836 --> 01:16.169
And?

01:16.471 --> 01:17.804
Reid, are you ok?

01:17.806 --> 01:19.439
It's my mom, she's in trouble.

01:19.441 --> 01:22.208
Were Reid and Diana
scheduled to have a visit?

01:22.210 --> 01:24.310
He didn't think so,
but it happened anyway.

01:24.312 --> 01:25.311
What does the nurse say?

01:25.313 --> 01:27.414
Cassie didn't bring Diana.

01:27.416 --> 01:30.250
Another nurse did, a Carol Atkinson.

01:30.252 --> 01:31.918
Garcia's running a
search on the name now,

01:31.920 --> 01:32.952
but it's an alias.

01:32.954 --> 01:34.287
For who?

01:34.289 --> 01:36.990
Cassie didn't bring my mom.
It was Lindsey,

01:36.992 --> 01:38.391
from Witness Protection.

01:38.393 --> 01:40.493
She pretended to be my mom's nurse.

01:40.495 --> 01:41.928
Now, I haven't figured
out the mechanics yet...

01:41.930 --> 01:43.029
Replacing Cassie,
winning my mom's trust,

01:43.031 --> 01:44.464
getting past prison security guards,

01:44.466 --> 01:46.699
but I will. I just
haven't figured it out yet.

01:46.701 --> 01:47.934
Reid...

01:47.936 --> 01:49.202
Do you remember that...
You remember, right?

01:49.204 --> 01:50.737
Her father, that case, April 2007?

01:50.739 --> 01:52.572
Ok. Maybe you think you saw her...

01:52.574 --> 01:54.674
Her father's Jack Vaughn,
former hit man for the Irish mob.

01:54.676 --> 01:56.075
He and Lindsey were
in Witness Protection.

01:56.077 --> 01:57.844
Lindsey and her friend
Katie were abducted,

01:57.846 --> 02:00.146
Katie was killed, and Jack
murdered the unsub in front of me.

02:00.148 --> 02:01.147
Kill him.

02:01.149 --> 02:02.482
When does it stop?

02:02.484 --> 02:04.017
Tomorrow.

02:05.320 --> 02:07.086
Do you honestly not
remember any of this?

02:07.088 --> 02:08.988
Yeah, I do. I'm sorry, I forgot.

02:08.990 --> 02:12.892
But, Reid, how could she possibly...

02:12.894 --> 02:14.761
I don't know! That's
why I'm telling you this.

02:14.763 --> 02:16.596
I don't know, but I know what I saw!

02:17.732 --> 02:19.466
Lindsey Vaughn?

02:19.468 --> 02:22.101
From that case in Chula Vista
10 years ago?

02:22.103 --> 02:23.369
You remember it.

02:23.371 --> 02:24.971
It was one of my first back.

02:24.973 --> 02:27.340
But how could it be her now? And why?

02:27.342 --> 02:28.942
I asked him the same thing.

02:28.944 --> 02:30.543
And how did that go?

02:30.545 --> 02:32.345
[Slams fist on table] You're
not even listening to me!

02:32.347 --> 02:33.713
I know what I saw, all right?!

02:33.715 --> 02:35.482
Now find Lindsey! Find Lindsey, please!

02:35.484 --> 02:37.317
- Hey, calm down.
- Get me out of here.

02:37.319 --> 02:38.551
Get me out of here!

02:38.553 --> 02:40.308
Find Lindsey!

02:40.722 --> 02:42.021
Any chance he's wrong?

02:42.023 --> 02:44.524
Well, Reid did smell Scratch's drugs

02:44.526 --> 02:46.059
before the murder, and he said

02:46.061 --> 02:48.127
there was another woman
in the room with them.

02:48.129 --> 02:51.064
Well, if Lindsey took Diana
to visit, where's Cassie?

02:51.066 --> 02:53.600
We don't know. Her phone
goes straight to voicemail.

02:53.602 --> 02:55.001
She's not returning texts, either.

02:55.003 --> 02:56.703
JJ said that has never happened.

02:56.705 --> 02:57.904
And Garcia pinged it?

02:57.906 --> 03:00.006
She tried, but the battery must be dead.

03:00.008 --> 03:01.641
The GPS was turned off.

03:01.643 --> 03:04.143
Walker and JJ are on their
way to Reid's apartment now.

03:04.145 --> 03:07.158
So what if this has been
a Scratch-Lindsey partnership

03:07.158 --> 03:08.215
this whole time?

03:08.216 --> 03:10.383
If that's true, given his mental state,

03:10.385 --> 03:13.520
I'm not sure Reid makes it to trial.

04:00.063 --> 04:02.230
Cassie's phone. Leave a message.

04:04.467 --> 04:06.067
Went to voicemail again?

04:06.069 --> 04:07.869
Yeah. You know, Cassie's a professional.

04:07.871 --> 04:10.909
She would never let her battery die.

04:21.151 --> 04:23.084
Diana? Cassie?

04:23.086 --> 04:25.019
It's me, Jennifer.

04:55.251 --> 04:56.551
Nobody's home.

04:56.553 --> 05:00.088
No. The scene doesn't say abduction.

05:00.090 --> 05:02.323
But under these circumstances, um...

05:02.325 --> 05:03.324
Yeah.

05:03.326 --> 05:04.826
We need to call Emily.

05:04.828 --> 05:07.128
We first came across
the Vaughns 10 years ago

05:07.130 --> 05:09.163
when Lindsey Vaughn and
her friend Katie Owen

05:09.165 --> 05:11.099
were abducted outside of
a crowded movie theater

05:11.101 --> 05:12.367
by 3 men.

05:12.369 --> 05:13.968
Ryan Phillips, the triad's dominant,

05:13.970 --> 05:16.104
tortured and strangled Katie.

05:16.106 --> 05:18.106
Jack Vaughn then took
matters into his own hands,

05:18.108 --> 05:19.974
using his skills to find Lindsey.

05:19.976 --> 05:21.809
It ended when Jack murdered Phillips

05:21.811 --> 05:23.277
in front of her and Reid.

05:23.279 --> 05:24.879
They let them stay in
the program after that?

05:24.881 --> 05:27.482
Jack was too important
a witness to cut loose.

05:27.484 --> 05:29.350
And no one's heard from
either of them till now?

05:29.352 --> 05:30.618
That's right.

05:30.620 --> 05:33.554
And Lindsey, posing as a
nurse named Carol Atkinson,

05:33.556 --> 05:36.124
was able to get Diana Reid
in and out of the Millburn

05:36.126 --> 05:37.291
correctional facility.

05:37.293 --> 05:38.726
And despite all the cameras,

05:38.728 --> 05:41.729
this is the only one that picked her up.

05:41.731 --> 05:45.099
So she knew exactly where they
were and how to avoid them.

05:46.302 --> 05:47.835
Please tell me you have good news.

05:47.837 --> 05:49.871
Well, Diana and Cassie aren't here.

05:49.873 --> 05:51.839
There's no forced
entry and no signs of struggle.

05:51.841 --> 05:54.175
And Cassie's car is gone.

05:54.177 --> 05:55.877
Garcia, where are we
on that APB of her car?

05:55.879 --> 05:57.211
I don't have anything yet.

05:57.213 --> 06:00.181
Ok. Also, search recent
traffic in and out

06:00.183 --> 06:02.283
of Reid's apartment. Lindsey
probably entered as Carol.

06:02.285 --> 06:03.384
Copy, copy.

06:03.386 --> 06:04.652
I know Diana's routine.

06:04.654 --> 06:07.655
Stephen and I will hit
up those places first.

06:07.657 --> 06:10.291
The rest of us need
to find Lindsey asap.

06:11.628 --> 06:15.029
I know a marshal that can help
cut through WITSEC's red tape.

06:15.031 --> 06:17.265
Yeah, I'm friendly with some
people at homeland security.

06:17.267 --> 06:18.666
I got a buddy at the DOJ,

06:18.668 --> 06:20.568
lost a lot of money to
him at poker. He owes me.

06:20.570 --> 06:23.071
Garcia, there was degraded female DNA

06:23.073 --> 06:24.505
and prints found at the crime scene.

06:24.507 --> 06:25.773
No matches in CODIS,

06:25.775 --> 06:27.675
but there might be something in WITSEC.

06:27.677 --> 06:29.744
I'll pull every favor, try every star.

06:29.746 --> 06:31.412
Are we gonna tell Reid?

06:31.414 --> 06:32.713
Not yet.

06:32.715 --> 06:35.851
I don't want to add more stress for him.

06:48.264 --> 06:50.798
Malcolm! You ok?

06:57.941 --> 06:59.373
Hey, man.

06:59.375 --> 07:00.775
Hey. Malcolm.

07:00.777 --> 07:03.211
Good to see you, brother.

07:03.213 --> 07:07.048
Mm. Thought I was gonna die in there.

07:07.050 --> 07:09.050
I'm glad you're ok.

07:09.052 --> 07:10.051
I'm all good.

07:10.053 --> 07:11.719
They got the green jell-o today.

07:11.721 --> 07:14.055
So much better than the yellow.

07:14.057 --> 07:15.356
What's the difference?

07:15.358 --> 07:18.593
It's a... Texture thing.

07:27.604 --> 07:30.671
You're a fed?

07:30.673 --> 07:33.474
That's gonna get you killed.

07:42.218 --> 07:44.585
Thanks.

07:44.587 --> 07:47.655
Homeland security gonna come through?

07:47.657 --> 07:50.625
No. DOJ?

07:50.627 --> 07:51.826
No.

07:51.828 --> 07:53.561
I just got off the phone with Fiona.

07:53.563 --> 07:56.364
Calvin Shaw and 6 other
inmates were poisoned.

07:56.366 --> 07:59.100
They were just released from
the infirmary this morning.

07:59.102 --> 08:00.301
Wait, what if this was what Reid

08:00.303 --> 08:02.036
was covering up in our cognitive?

08:02.038 --> 08:03.104
Could be.

08:03.106 --> 08:04.272
With them back,

08:04.274 --> 08:05.840
Reid knows they'll target him.

08:35.038 --> 08:36.837
- Garcia.
- What do you need?

08:36.839 --> 08:38.039
Metro P.D. found Cassie's car

08:38.041 --> 08:39.307
and called it in immediately.

08:39.736 --> 08:43.971
No signs of her or Diana. No foul play.

08:43.972 --> 08:45.773
There are...

08:45.775 --> 08:47.742
There are 3 visible cameras.

08:47.744 --> 08:49.944
One nearby and two down the way.

08:49.946 --> 08:51.545
I can tap into them,
see what I can find.

08:52.949 --> 08:54.448
Oh, oh, uh, uh, Walker
and JJ are calling in.

08:54.450 --> 08:55.516
You want me to patch you through?

08:55.518 --> 08:56.984
Please.

08:57.286 --> 08:58.919
Walker, JJ, you're on with Alvez.

08:58.921 --> 09:02.023
Hey, Luke, no luck
finding Cassie or Diana.

09:02.025 --> 09:04.358
All right. Well, I'm at
Cassie's car right now.

09:04.360 --> 09:05.960
Forensically, it's a dead end,

09:05.962 --> 09:09.930
but, uh, behaviorally
we might have something.

09:09.932 --> 09:11.799
It's parked down the
block from a high school.

09:11.801 --> 09:15.403
A high school is where Jack
Vaughn killed Lindsey's abductor

09:15.405 --> 09:16.804
in front of her and Spence.

09:16.806 --> 09:19.306
Well, placing the car there
could be a taunt at us.

09:19.308 --> 09:20.307
That's what I'm thinking.

09:20.309 --> 09:21.575
I can look into that. I can...

09:21.577 --> 09:23.262
Oh!

09:24.313 --> 09:25.846
Garcia?

09:25.848 --> 09:28.516
Oh, uh, uh, per Emily,
I was supposed to look

09:28.518 --> 09:30.718
at the recent foot traffic
in and out of Reid's building.

09:30.720 --> 09:33.421
There is no sign of Carol Atkinson,

09:33.423 --> 09:35.589
but a Jaime Lamantia keeps popping up.

09:35.591 --> 09:37.858
She lives in unit 26
down the hall from Reid.

09:37.860 --> 09:40.828
She paid 6 months of her
rent up front in cash,

09:40.830 --> 09:42.196
and there's been not
a peep from her since.

09:42.198 --> 09:44.031
How's Jaime connected to Lindsey?

09:44.033 --> 09:46.067
No, no, there's no connection.
You don't understand.

09:46.069 --> 09:47.401
They're the same.
They're the same person.

09:47.403 --> 09:50.104
Carol Atkinson is Jaime Lamantia
who is Lindsey Vaughn.

09:50.106 --> 09:51.572
I'm 20 minutes from Reid's apartment.

09:51.574 --> 09:52.773
Yeah, we're 10.

10:14.464 --> 10:16.630
It's Cassie.

10:21.437 --> 10:23.137
Stephen.

10:39.789 --> 10:41.489
Emily...

10:43.126 --> 10:45.015
Yeah. Thanks.

10:48.297 --> 10:52.199
JJ and Walker just found
Cassie's body in Reid's building.

10:52.201 --> 10:55.169
She'd been shot once in
the head, execution style.

10:55.171 --> 10:59.273
Lindsey used a second alias to
rent an apartment down the hall.

10:59.275 --> 11:01.567
What about Diana?

11:01.677 --> 11:03.878
She's been abducted.

11:03.880 --> 11:06.547
They found surveillance
photos taken of Reid

11:06.549 --> 11:07.882
before his arrest.

11:07.884 --> 11:09.583
Lindsey's been spying on him for months.

11:09.585 --> 11:10.851
I can't believe it.

11:10.853 --> 11:13.187
Everything Reid said was right.

11:13.189 --> 11:16.323
I didn't want to before,
but I have to tell him now,

11:16.325 --> 11:17.758
for his own safety.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.326
He'll want to help find her.

11:19.328 --> 11:21.929
That's what I'm afraid of, and he can't.

11:21.931 --> 11:25.466
This could be what
pushes him over the edge.

11:57.372 --> 11:58.976
Thanks for coming in, Kevin, all right?

11:59.019 --> 12:00.819
I'm sorry we couldn't talk
about this on the phone.

12:00.819 --> 12:02.254
No problem. How can I help?

12:02.256 --> 12:06.091
We need access to
Lindsey and Jack Vaughn.

12:06.093 --> 12:07.392
I can't do that.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.127
It's protocol. I'm not allowed.

12:09.129 --> 12:12.864
We've linked her to an abduction/homicide
of a team member's family.

12:12.866 --> 12:15.300
Ballistics confirmed the
gun belonged to Jack Vaughn,

12:15.302 --> 12:17.602
but the shooter used
modified hollow-point bullets.

12:17.604 --> 12:18.903
That's not Jack's M.O.

12:18.905 --> 12:21.906
Jack Vaughn's been a model citizen
his entire time in the program.

12:21.908 --> 12:24.609
Lindsey bailed out 5 years ago.

12:24.611 --> 12:26.645
Do you have any idea where she is?

12:26.647 --> 12:28.647
We don't track people after they leave.

12:28.649 --> 12:31.082
Come on, man.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.984
Luke, my hands are tied.

12:35.555 --> 12:38.390
Like in Yemen?

12:38.392 --> 12:42.034
'Cause I'm sure the deputy director
would love to know about that.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.601
I'm out of options, man.

12:52.873 --> 12:54.706
Give me a few hours.

12:54.708 --> 12:57.709
I can get you a meet with
Jack in a neutral location,

12:57.711 --> 13:00.745
Beloit, Wisconsin,
for no more than 30 minutes.

13:00.747 --> 13:01.980
Understood?

13:01.982 --> 13:04.382
Thank you. We owe you.

13:04.384 --> 13:05.650
Appreciate it.

13:08.889 --> 13:11.723
I'm sure that wasn't how
you wanted to play it.

13:11.725 --> 13:13.725
It wasn't my first choice.

13:13.727 --> 13:15.960
Grab Walker. Get to the jet.

13:15.962 --> 13:19.798
I'm going to the prison.
Reid deserves to know everything.

13:21.702 --> 13:23.835
I'm so sorry, Spencer.

13:23.837 --> 13:26.538
We will find her, I promise.

13:26.540 --> 13:28.606
We'll find her, ok?

13:28.608 --> 13:31.843
Ballistics came back on the
gun that was used on Cassie.

13:31.845 --> 13:34.446
It's the exact weapon Jack Vaughn used

13:34.448 --> 13:36.548
when he was a mob enforcer in Boston.

13:36.550 --> 13:38.550
Lindsey must have taken
it from her father.

13:38.552 --> 13:40.518
Maybe she wanted his reputation

13:40.520 --> 13:42.787
or she just wanted to make sure her dad

13:42.789 --> 13:44.322
knew what she was doing.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.890
The reasons are unimportant.

13:45.892 --> 13:47.525
What's important is you were right,

13:47.527 --> 13:50.061
and I should have
believed you from the start

13:50.063 --> 13:51.629
and I didn't.

13:51.631 --> 13:52.997
It's because she's a daddy's girl.

13:52.999 --> 13:54.332
Go on, Daddy, kill him!

13:54.334 --> 13:56.434
Son of a bitch, he killed
her. He killed Katie!

13:56.436 --> 13:58.603
The gun is an odd
touch of sentimentality

13:58.605 --> 14:00.572
for an otherwise logistical killer.

14:00.574 --> 14:01.706
She took the gun because
she's a daddy's girl,

14:01.708 --> 14:02.941
because they were inseparable.

14:02.943 --> 14:05.443
Yeah. Yes, we can use that.

14:05.445 --> 14:07.145
We're already trying to
track him down in WITSEC.

14:07.147 --> 14:08.947
He need to find him. He's the key.

14:08.949 --> 14:09.948
We know.

14:09.950 --> 14:11.316
And hurry.

14:11.318 --> 14:13.551
Find my mom.

14:13.553 --> 14:17.021
Promise me you'll find my mom.

14:17.023 --> 14:19.591
Yes, I promise.

14:19.593 --> 14:21.459
I know you're scared.

14:21.461 --> 14:24.429
Try to isolate yourself.

14:31.972 --> 14:34.539
Thank you for meeting with me, warden.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.808
SSA Reid's in trouble.

14:36.810 --> 14:39.110
I'm sorry.

14:39.112 --> 14:41.212
There's nothing I can do for him.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.348
All we want is protective custody.

14:43.350 --> 14:44.983
In my house, that's a privilege.

14:44.985 --> 14:48.153
And your friend hasn't
exactly been an altar boy.

14:48.155 --> 14:50.555
It's just for a few days,
until we know he's safe.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.023
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't.

14:52.025 --> 14:53.758
But why not?

14:53.760 --> 14:56.294
The higher-ups but a block on him.

14:56.296 --> 14:58.930
He's gen pop all the way.

14:58.932 --> 15:02.467
But SSA Reid is in extreme danger.

15:02.469 --> 15:03.535
Who here isn't?

15:03.537 --> 15:05.637
There are extenuating circumstances.

15:05.639 --> 15:07.439
Know how many times a day I hear that?

15:07.441 --> 15:11.209
I give in to him, the
other will come crying.

15:11.211 --> 15:13.545
SSA Reid has rights.

15:13.547 --> 15:16.281
He sure does.

15:16.283 --> 15:19.017
And those are being
met, I promise you that.

15:19.019 --> 15:21.019
I have his lawyer standing by.

15:21.021 --> 15:26.624
Look, I know the FBI
don't have his back,

15:26.626 --> 15:29.360
which means y'all are on an island.

15:30.697 --> 15:33.531
Ok. I know it's a
different agency and all,

15:33.533 --> 15:36.134
but couldn't someone have told
us that Lindsey left WITSEC?

15:36.136 --> 15:38.203
No. It's for her own protection.

15:38.205 --> 15:40.104
The marshals stay away
unless you're in trouble.

15:40.106 --> 15:42.807
Even our own case agents aren't
told about their member status.

15:42.809 --> 15:44.409
How'd it go with Reid?

15:44.411 --> 15:46.778
As expected. He thinks
Lindsey's using her father's gun

15:46.780 --> 15:48.079
as a way to carry on his legacy.

15:48.081 --> 15:50.315
Makes sense, given her daddy issues.

15:50.317 --> 15:53.117
And I spoke to the warden about
putting Reid in protective custody,

15:53.119 --> 15:54.152
but he said no.

15:54.154 --> 15:56.421
Ok. More ballistics

15:56.423 --> 15:58.723
literally just came in
on Jack Vaughn's gun,

15:58.725 --> 16:02.560
and, oh, my goodness, Lindsey
has been a busy evil bee.

16:02.562 --> 16:03.695
How busy?

16:03.697 --> 16:05.530
That gun has been involved

16:05.532 --> 16:07.999
in 15 murders in the last 5 years.

16:08.001 --> 16:11.636
Single shot to the back of the
head with a modified hollow-point.

16:11.638 --> 16:12.804
That's our Lindsey.

16:12.806 --> 16:14.405
You guys see the geographical pattern?

16:14.407 --> 16:16.641
All of the kills are along
the U.S-Mexico border.

16:16.643 --> 16:19.677
And each of the victims
have apparent cartel ties.

16:19.679 --> 16:22.180
So, Lindsey's been a cartel hit woman

16:22.182 --> 16:23.481
ever since she left the program.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.717
Ok, but why is she using her dad's gun?

16:25.719 --> 16:28.620
That helps us, and it's risky for her.

16:28.622 --> 16:31.389
It's an impulse. It's not a choice.

16:35.862 --> 16:39.564
Jack, I'm SSA Alvez, this is SSA Walker,

16:39.566 --> 16:41.266
and we're with the BAU.

16:41.268 --> 16:43.510
We need to find Lindsey.

16:44.371 --> 16:45.737
Jack, have you seen her?

16:45.739 --> 16:47.939
No. What's this about, anyway?

16:47.941 --> 16:49.541
I'm 10 years in, all of a sudden

16:49.543 --> 16:51.809
you guys want to talk to me.

16:51.811 --> 16:53.177
Lindsey's in trouble.

16:53.179 --> 16:54.345
Your gun was used in a murder

16:54.347 --> 16:56.514
in D.C. recently and others like it

16:56.516 --> 16:58.082
over the last 5 years.

16:58.084 --> 17:00.952
She must have hid it before
WITSEC had the chance to find it.

17:08.428 --> 17:10.094
Look, I'm not gonna lie.

17:10.096 --> 17:11.429
This is bad for her.

17:11.431 --> 17:13.431
When we get Lindsey,
and we will get her,

17:13.433 --> 17:15.165
she'll be inside for life.

17:17.604 --> 17:19.002
But at least you can see her.

17:19.005 --> 17:21.606
She contacted you recently?

17:21.608 --> 17:23.741
I talked to her about two
months ago on the phone.

17:23.742 --> 17:26.611
She called me and she
wanted to know about some...

17:26.613 --> 17:28.813
High-grade pharmaceuticals in Mexico,

17:28.815 --> 17:30.114
something I never heard of.

17:30.116 --> 17:31.983
What kind? What are they called?

17:31.985 --> 17:34.786
I don't know. It was like...

17:34.788 --> 17:38.456
Sc... scope something, I don't know.

17:38.458 --> 17:41.392
Scopolomine and sevoflurane.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.761
Yeah. How'd you know that?

17:45.098 --> 17:46.197
Thanks, Luke.

17:46.199 --> 17:47.765
Jack said Lindsey was looking

17:47.767 --> 17:50.168
for the exact same drugs Scratch uses.

17:50.170 --> 17:51.970
Scratch has a long reach.

17:51.972 --> 17:54.639
Look at that riot in
the prison last year.

17:54.641 --> 17:57.642
You know, it's possible
he has help on the inside.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.877
Maybe we can go to the warden

17:59.879 --> 18:02.714
and get him to give us
protective custody again.

18:02.716 --> 18:04.449
No, the warden is a dead end.

18:04.451 --> 18:06.217
We have to go to the courts.

18:06.219 --> 18:09.887
How? It's not like you can
just walk up to the judge.

18:09.889 --> 18:11.956
Or I could.

18:11.958 --> 18:13.458
Whoa, whoa.

18:13.460 --> 18:16.127
Now, is that legal, Emily?

18:16.129 --> 18:18.863
It is. It's just inappropriate

18:18.865 --> 18:20.598
and a relative long shot.

18:20.600 --> 18:21.933
What will Fiona say?

18:21.935 --> 18:23.167
Well, I wouldn't tell her.

18:23.169 --> 18:25.403
I would make the request
as a federal agent,

18:25.405 --> 18:28.439
not an advocate for the defendant.

18:34.381 --> 18:37.515
The deal is I save your ass.

18:37.517 --> 18:39.717
That's enough charity.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.553
I'm not gonna move the drugs.

18:44.724 --> 18:47.476
You're losing it.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.495
Check.

19:02.475 --> 19:03.908
You're gonna need to grow eyes

19:03.910 --> 19:05.843
in the back of your head,

19:05.845 --> 19:08.913
because you'll never see it coming.

19:11.317 --> 19:14.052
I have a better idea.

19:14.054 --> 19:16.454
What's that?

19:16.456 --> 19:19.090
Aah!

19:19.092 --> 19:20.391
No, no, I didn't do it!

19:20.393 --> 19:21.859
I didn't...

19:21.861 --> 19:23.361
It wasn't me, man!

19:24.564 --> 19:26.698
He did it!

19:26.700 --> 19:27.865
Look, look!

19:58.478 --> 20:00.478
Why would Scratch choose Lindsey?

20:00.480 --> 20:02.113
I mean, her ties to Reid are distant.

20:02.115 --> 20:04.249
Walker and I, we kicked
it around on the flight,

20:04.251 --> 20:07.485
and we imagine that
Scratch was digging further

20:07.487 --> 20:09.854
into Reid's past and he saw that Lindsey

20:09.856 --> 20:11.256
had become a contract killer.

20:11.258 --> 20:12.457
Realized she could get to him

20:12.459 --> 20:13.491
in a way that he couldn't.

20:13.493 --> 20:14.893
It may be logistical, too.

20:14.895 --> 20:17.228
Scratch has never run
out of drugs before,

20:17.230 --> 20:19.864
but now he's a fugitive and
might not be able to get them.

20:19.866 --> 20:21.333
Well, Lindsey knows the border.

20:21.335 --> 20:22.667
She'd be a good drug mule.

20:22.669 --> 20:24.102
Good news, bad news.

20:24.104 --> 20:26.204
I am on the books first thing tomorrow

20:26.206 --> 20:28.506
with Judge Frost and AUSA Martinez.

20:28.508 --> 20:29.741
But all we have is a theory

20:29.743 --> 20:31.343
and no support from the brass.

20:31.345 --> 20:32.811
That's never stopped us before.

20:32.813 --> 20:35.480
I guess we have 12 hours
to make an airtight case

20:35.482 --> 20:36.815
for you to bring to them.

20:36.817 --> 20:39.784
Yes. Not only that, we
also need a paper trail.

20:39.786 --> 20:42.987
I'll put on the coffee.

20:45.158 --> 20:47.192
Excuse me.

20:52.999 --> 20:56.701
Hey, were you able to get
Lindsey's print files from WITSEC?

20:56.703 --> 21:00.111
I'm close, but I need more time.

21:00.340 --> 21:02.273
Garcia, what's wrong?

21:02.275 --> 21:06.511
Reid stabbed himself to get
into solitary confinement.

21:06.513 --> 21:08.480
Ohh, that's great.

21:08.482 --> 21:09.714
What?

21:09.716 --> 21:11.516
Well, he found a way to isolate himself

21:11.518 --> 21:13.651
without hurting anybody else.

21:13.653 --> 21:16.121
Ok. Here.

21:17.891 --> 21:19.190
What is this?

21:19.192 --> 21:21.526
It's my letter of resignation.

21:21.528 --> 21:22.527
Penelope.

21:22.529 --> 21:24.162
No.

21:24.164 --> 21:26.097
If Reid dies, I quit.

21:26.099 --> 21:29.401
We won't let that happen.

21:29.403 --> 21:31.302
Emily, I'm exhausted,

21:31.304 --> 21:33.438
and it is breaking me,
and this whole year

21:33.440 --> 21:35.206
has been an emotional roller coaster.

21:35.208 --> 21:36.875
It's like every time something happens,

21:36.877 --> 21:39.744
there's a piece of myself
that is being chipped away,

21:39.746 --> 21:41.379
and if one more thing goes down,

21:41.381 --> 21:44.783
I don't think there's
going to be anything left.

21:58.532 --> 22:01.533
We leave no stone unturned.

22:24.424 --> 22:26.866
Hey, guys.

22:27.027 --> 22:31.729
Ok. I got Carol Atkinson
crossing the border at Los Indios.

22:31.731 --> 22:35.467
There's a factory
nearby that manufactures

22:35.469 --> 22:38.303
non-FDA-approved seasickness tablets.

22:38.305 --> 22:40.805
Essentially, scopolamine pills.

22:40.807 --> 22:44.375
Los Indios is only a
40-minute drive to Matamoros.

22:44.377 --> 22:46.978
Looks like we've got
Lindsey where we need her.

22:46.980 --> 22:49.573
Now we put the knife in her hand.

23:23.550 --> 23:26.651
In here, we're all psychopaths.

23:26.653 --> 23:27.852
We have to be,

23:27.854 --> 23:29.988
'cause it's predator or prey.

23:29.990 --> 23:32.957
Oh, my stomach.

23:32.959 --> 23:35.360
Medic! Cell block C, now!

23:35.362 --> 23:36.861
I helped you because I like you.

23:36.863 --> 23:38.329
But you keep this up,

23:38.331 --> 23:40.665
keep thinking the normal
rules apply in here,

23:40.667 --> 23:43.902
then I cannot help you.

23:43.904 --> 23:45.970
Good luck, brother.
You're gonna need it.

24:13.266 --> 24:15.733
I can get you anywhere.

24:15.735 --> 24:17.969
I own this place.

24:17.971 --> 24:20.705
You really think you
can get away with it?

24:20.707 --> 24:22.941
Not in here.

24:22.943 --> 24:25.009
Not on my watch.

24:35.989 --> 24:38.790
Rick, what have you got?

24:38.792 --> 24:41.926
Well, ok, guys, Jack's
gun was used in Mexico

24:41.928 --> 24:43.761
the day before Nadie's murder.

24:43.763 --> 24:44.996
What, another cartel hit?

24:44.998 --> 24:47.732
No. The victim was a Victor Flores.

24:47.734 --> 24:49.901
He was a local real estate broker,

24:49.903 --> 24:51.235
a model citizen.

24:51.237 --> 24:54.572
Point-blank. Back of
the head, with a modified

24:54.574 --> 24:56.107
hollow-point bullet.

24:56.109 --> 24:57.175
That's Lindsey, all right.

24:57.177 --> 24:59.377
Why are we only hearing about it now?

24:59.379 --> 25:01.245
Because it was in Monterrey.

25:01.247 --> 25:02.814
It's a different jurisdiction.

25:02.816 --> 25:04.215
Ok, so,

25:04.217 --> 25:06.918
she crosses the border at Los Indios,

25:06.920 --> 25:08.486
which is very close to Matamoros,

25:08.488 --> 25:11.222
drives 3 hours west to
Monterrey, kills Victor,

25:11.224 --> 25:13.825
and then drives 4
hours east to Matamoros?

25:13.827 --> 25:15.760
All possible within a day's drive.

25:15.762 --> 25:17.829
Sure, but why go to all the trouble?

25:17.831 --> 25:19.697
Why pick Victor Flores?

25:19.699 --> 25:22.233
It sounds too random to be random.

25:22.235 --> 25:25.169
All right. All right,
thanks, Rick. I owe you.

25:25.171 --> 25:28.506
Mexican authorities found
an abandoned truck last week

25:28.508 --> 25:29.741
that matches the one Reid described.

25:29.743 --> 25:31.509
It was dumped two states over.

25:31.511 --> 25:33.645
Did it belong to a Victor Flores?

25:33.647 --> 25:34.679
Yeah. How'd you know that?

25:34.681 --> 25:36.347
Lindsey killed him before Nadie.

25:36.349 --> 25:38.149
She must have stolen his truck, too.

25:38.151 --> 25:40.652
All right, well, we're
making some real headway here.

25:40.654 --> 25:42.854
Yeah, and it's great.
Guys, don't get me wrong,

25:42.856 --> 25:45.089
but it's all circumstantial.

25:45.091 --> 25:48.493
Garcia, any luck finding Lindsey's
prints from her WITSEC file?

25:48.495 --> 25:50.695
I called in every favor I
can think of and then some.

25:50.697 --> 25:52.997
It's gonna take me, like, 5 more hours

25:52.999 --> 25:54.332
to cut through all this red tape.

25:54.334 --> 25:58.036
I have to be at the courthouse in one.

26:00.507 --> 26:03.574
Agent Prentiss, calling
a meeting like this

26:03.576 --> 26:06.878
is highly irregular.

26:06.880 --> 26:10.081
I understand, and I appreciate your time

26:10.083 --> 26:11.649
under these unique circumstances.

26:11.651 --> 26:13.918
If you're advocating on
behalf of Spencer Reid,

26:13.920 --> 26:15.219
shouldn't Ms. Duncan be present?

26:15.221 --> 26:17.488
I am not here on his behalf.

26:17.490 --> 26:19.590
I asked for this meeting
in my official capacity

26:19.592 --> 26:20.825
as government agent.

26:22.062 --> 26:23.728
That's absurd and inappropriate.

26:23.730 --> 26:25.863
You don't even have FBI support.

26:25.865 --> 26:29.734
Regardless, the BAU believes
that the murder of Nadie Ramos

26:29.736 --> 26:31.569
was committed by a contract killer

26:31.571 --> 26:33.404
with personal ties to the team,

26:33.406 --> 26:37.141
at the behest of a serial
killer we've targeted for years.

26:37.143 --> 26:39.544
I'm sure you've heard of
Occam's razor, Agent Prentiss.

26:39.546 --> 26:42.814
Their continued partnership
is a major security risk,

26:42.816 --> 26:44.382
threatening the lives of...

26:44.384 --> 26:47.018
How dare you attempt to
minimize the life of Nadie Ramos.

26:47.020 --> 26:48.486
I'm doing no such thing.

26:48.488 --> 26:50.188
Nadie deserves justice.

26:50.190 --> 26:51.823
Every word in here is circumstantial.

26:51.825 --> 26:55.059
If you compare the partial
prints found at the scene

26:55.061 --> 26:56.861
to Lindsey's from her WITSEC file,

26:56.863 --> 26:58.930
it proves she did this.

26:58.932 --> 27:00.131
And where's that report?

27:00.133 --> 27:01.265
It's on its way now.

27:01.267 --> 27:04.502
So you have nothing
definitive here, now.

27:04.504 --> 27:06.504
Unreal.

27:06.506 --> 27:07.839
An innocent man...

27:07.841 --> 27:10.441
His possessions were
found at the crime scene

27:10.443 --> 27:11.743
covered in the victim's blood,

27:11.745 --> 27:14.512
a cut on his hand
matching the murder weapon.

27:14.514 --> 27:15.580
You call that innocent?

27:15.582 --> 27:17.615
Until proven otherwise, yes.

27:17.617 --> 27:21.419
Another woman was in that motel room.

27:21.421 --> 27:22.787
The M.O. matches.

27:22.789 --> 27:25.123
Agent Reid was high out of his mind.

27:25.125 --> 27:26.991
Not exactly the best witness.

27:26.993 --> 27:28.960
I guarantee Lindsey was there.

27:28.962 --> 27:30.962
I know if I chose to ignore protocol

27:30.964 --> 27:33.431
and waste the judge's
time, I'd certainly propose

27:33.433 --> 27:35.833
more than a couple of
loosely tied theories.

27:35.835 --> 27:37.101
I'd bring evidence.

27:37.103 --> 27:38.069
We are!

27:38.071 --> 27:39.170
But until you do...

27:39.172 --> 27:42.507
That's enough, counselor.

27:44.410 --> 27:47.612
Agent Prentiss, you
know as well as I do,

27:47.614 --> 27:51.349
every piece of this must
be checked out thoroughly.

27:51.351 --> 27:52.517
Yes, your honor.

27:52.519 --> 27:54.852
And that's gonna take time.

27:54.854 --> 27:57.088
Which is something he doesn't have.

28:16.576 --> 28:18.242
Unh!

28:18.244 --> 28:19.277
Help!

28:25.485 --> 28:27.585
Let's go.

28:31.291 --> 28:33.357
You're gonna need to grow eyes

28:33.359 --> 28:35.393
in the back of your head.

28:36.496 --> 28:38.462
Hey, hey, sit down.

28:39.666 --> 28:41.566
They're gonna beat you again.

28:43.403 --> 28:45.336
Might even kill you.

28:45.338 --> 28:47.071
You'll never see it coming.

28:47.073 --> 28:48.840
Aah!

28:48.842 --> 28:52.710
You'll never see it coming.

29:17.070 --> 29:19.871
I can get you anywhere.

29:19.873 --> 29:22.707
I own this place.

29:30.283 --> 29:33.784
We're taking you home.

29:49.435 --> 29:51.903
You don't know who you're
messing with, Alvez.

29:51.905 --> 29:54.424
Yes, I do.

29:54.741 --> 29:56.774
Biggest cartels in the world

29:56.776 --> 29:59.544
run things through walls like this.

30:00.046 --> 30:03.114
There's no paper trail, but
based on your collections,

30:03.116 --> 30:05.375
I can tell you're a, what, sergeant?

30:06.419 --> 30:09.954
You're rewarded because you got
more time to get things done.

30:09.956 --> 30:12.115
Let's say you're right.

30:12.625 --> 30:15.559
Then you know we're 8,000 strong.

30:15.561 --> 30:19.330
Not just inside these
walls, but all over.

30:19.332 --> 30:23.067
The Bureau's 80,000 strong,

30:23.069 --> 30:25.169
and you betrayed us,

30:25.171 --> 30:27.405
but it always comes back.

30:27.407 --> 30:29.073
Good luck with that.

30:29.075 --> 30:34.372
After you leave, I'll have all
my stuff back in a couple hours.

30:34.380 --> 30:35.813
That would be impressive,

30:35.815 --> 30:38.983
seeing you do that from FCI Milan.

30:38.985 --> 30:42.996
What... you transferring me?

30:43.423 --> 30:45.054
To Michigan?

30:45.158 --> 30:47.658
You won't get to see
your son every week,

30:47.660 --> 30:49.126
and rumor has it

30:49.128 --> 30:51.929
that some of the Bratva
family's holed up in there.

30:51.931 --> 30:55.166
You know, the Russian family that
you double-crossed to begin with,

30:55.168 --> 30:58.569
and my understanding is that they are...

30:58.571 --> 31:02.013
excited to see you.

31:02.675 --> 31:06.544
You don't think they
hold grudges, do you?

31:37.977 --> 31:39.477
Let's get my mom back.

31:39.479 --> 31:40.945
Yeah.

31:47.747 --> 31:50.448
I can't thank you enough for
going out on a limb on this.

31:50.450 --> 31:52.283
No need to thank me, agent Prentiss.

31:52.285 --> 31:54.285
You're the one who risked everything.

31:54.287 --> 31:56.287
We only did what we had to.

31:56.289 --> 31:58.923
I'm just glad for his
sake, for everybody's sake,

31:58.925 --> 32:02.126
that your analyst was able to get
those prints over here in time.

32:02.128 --> 32:04.028
It was no short order, believe me.

32:04.030 --> 32:07.565
I'm sure it wasn't, and in
the end, justice was served.

32:07.567 --> 32:08.666
That's what matters.

32:08.668 --> 32:11.068
I also wanted to
apologize for my conduct

32:11.070 --> 32:12.236
in your chambers.

32:12.238 --> 32:13.571
I nearly allowed my emotions

32:13.573 --> 32:16.407
to carry the situation,
and it was out of line.

32:16.409 --> 32:18.676
Well, given the circumstances,

32:18.678 --> 32:19.944
it's more than understandable.

32:19.946 --> 32:21.679
Thank you again, your honor.

32:21.681 --> 32:23.547
Have a good night, Agent Prentiss.

32:23.549 --> 32:25.049
You, too.

32:28.087 --> 32:30.154
So we know Lindsey convinced Scratch

32:30.156 --> 32:31.856
to run drugs across the border.

32:31.858 --> 32:34.025
And that Lindsey's been
operating from two locations...

32:34.027 --> 32:37.495
An apartment next to Reid
and a house in southeast D.C.

32:37.497 --> 32:39.096
And that's where we think
she's keeping your mom.

32:39.098 --> 32:41.165
Scratch isn't afraid to
plot an elaborate trap.

32:41.167 --> 32:42.767
I want a full breakdown of that house

32:42.769 --> 32:44.571
before we set one foot inside.

32:44.637 --> 32:46.739
Um...

32:47.941 --> 32:49.473
Spencer.

32:49.475 --> 32:52.376
You can't officially go
until you're reinstated.

32:52.378 --> 32:55.112
So that includes going to my apartment,

32:55.114 --> 32:56.647
since it's a crime scene.

32:56.649 --> 33:00.751
That's right. It's sealed
and guarded by Metro P.D.

33:01.096 --> 33:03.964
But you are the resident.

33:03.966 --> 33:05.198
You got it?

33:05.200 --> 33:07.004
Got it.

33:11.006 --> 33:13.140
You all right?

33:15.010 --> 33:17.611
Uh, it's open.

33:18.614 --> 33:20.247
Of course.

33:29.992 --> 33:32.859
He's the resident. He's
just gonna grab a few things.

33:42.595 --> 33:43.794
What is it?

33:43.796 --> 33:46.163
This picture was on a different page.

33:53.339 --> 33:54.772
Does that mean something to you?

33:54.774 --> 33:59.210
Only the obvious, male
and female chromosomes,

33:59.212 --> 34:01.946
Lindsey's way of telling
us she's with Scratch.

34:21.199 --> 34:23.033
Alvez, Lewis, take the back.

34:23.034 --> 34:25.636
Walker and Rossi with me at the front.

34:56.869 --> 34:58.702
All right, we're in. Give us a 5-count.

35:00.373 --> 35:01.739
Let's go.

35:06.913 --> 35:08.245
FBI! Show your hands!

35:08.247 --> 35:09.918
Hands up, now!

35:10.516 --> 35:11.515
Put it down.

35:11.517 --> 35:12.516
It's for you.

35:12.518 --> 35:14.752
Get up, turn around, slowly.

35:18.491 --> 35:20.291
Get down.

35:22.361 --> 35:23.494
This is for you.

35:23.496 --> 35:25.988
She said it was for you, for the FBI.

35:31.837 --> 35:33.729
You know who that is?

35:34.106 --> 35:36.477
Cat Adams?

35:38.878 --> 35:40.611
♪ Ta-da ♪

35:40.613 --> 35:42.580
Didn't expect me, did you?

35:42.582 --> 35:45.616
Impersonating Scratch
was getting tiresome.

35:45.618 --> 35:48.319
Now, if the good doctor
wants his mommy back,

35:48.321 --> 35:51.722
send him to me.
He knows where to find me.

35:51.724 --> 35:53.324
After all, he put me here.

35:53.326 --> 35:56.794
But then again, I kind of
returned the favor, didn't I?

35:56.796 --> 35:59.726
He and I have unfinished business.

36:02.835 --> 36:04.068
Really?

36:04.070 --> 36:05.469
We have to deal with Cat Adams again?

36:05.471 --> 36:08.453
Yes. She was pulling
the strings all along.

36:08.611 --> 36:10.881
And, wait, Mr. Scratch's
involvement was...

36:11.048 --> 36:12.076
Never part of it.

36:12.108 --> 36:14.275
Cat and Lindsey were behind
the murder of Nadie Ramos

36:14.277 --> 36:16.344
and framing Spencer.

36:17.136 --> 36:18.871
Why does she have it
out so bad for Reid?

36:18.871 --> 36:20.859
She was loosely affiliated
with a group of hit men.

36:20.859 --> 36:23.117
About a year and a half
ago, Reid outsmarted her

36:23.119 --> 36:25.153
when he pretended to
be a potential customer.

36:25.155 --> 36:27.222
Do you know why I'm so good at my job?

36:27.224 --> 36:30.091
Because you kill without
compunction or remorse.

36:30.093 --> 36:32.894
She figured out she
was walking into a trap.

36:32.896 --> 36:35.029
But Reid was able to
convince her to surrender

36:35.031 --> 36:37.565
by telling here he would
take her to see her father.

36:37.567 --> 36:39.400
I found your father.

36:41.438 --> 36:43.171
Did he?

36:43.173 --> 36:45.907
No. It was all a lie to
get her to drop the gun.

36:45.909 --> 36:47.976
Here? He's here?

36:51.448 --> 36:53.581
You lied to me.

36:54.651 --> 36:56.784
She's been in prison ever since.

36:56.786 --> 36:58.786
She's been nursing a
grudge for a long time.

36:58.788 --> 37:01.890
Setting up Reid, making us and him

37:01.892 --> 37:04.292
believe that is was
Mr. Scratch this whole time,

37:04.294 --> 37:05.827
and now kidnapping his mother.

37:05.829 --> 37:07.195
Where is she now?

37:07.197 --> 37:09.194
Mount Pleasant women's
correctional facility.

37:09.194 --> 37:11.032
Wait, hold up. Reid has
to go back to prison?

37:11.034 --> 37:12.333
He just landed.

37:19.543 --> 37:21.776
Do you really
think that he can handle it?

37:21.778 --> 37:23.344
I mean, all that Reid's been through.

37:23.346 --> 37:25.313
Do you really think he
has the brain capacity

37:25.315 --> 37:27.330
to do this right now?

37:27.330 --> 37:29.340
She's right. He's walking
into one of the most

37:29.340 --> 37:31.525
unstable situations anyone could face.

37:31.525 --> 37:33.772
She's been in solitary
confinement 6 months.

37:33.772 --> 37:36.190
We all know what that can do
to the psyche of an inmate.

37:36.192 --> 37:38.426
At best, they suffer from delusions.

37:38.428 --> 37:40.128
At worst, they're psychotic.

37:40.130 --> 37:41.763
I took all of that into account.

37:41.765 --> 37:44.399
That's why I didn't
send Reid in there alone.

37:47.304 --> 37:49.504
So, well, what's the play here?

37:49.506 --> 37:53.074
We hope that Reid can
profile his mom's location

37:53.076 --> 37:56.210
out of Cat, and we
just wait until he does?

37:56.212 --> 37:57.211
That's part one.

37:57.213 --> 37:59.948
Part two is we refocus and rebuild

37:59.950 --> 38:01.115
based on what we know,

38:01.117 --> 38:02.984
and search for any leads we missed

38:02.986 --> 38:04.819
because of our faulty assumptions.

38:04.821 --> 38:07.188
Well, since we're on that topic,

38:07.190 --> 38:08.823
Reid shouldn't be in there at all.

38:08.825 --> 38:10.558
He's as compromised as it gets.

38:10.560 --> 38:12.327
He hasn't even been reinstated.

38:12.329 --> 38:14.028
If we send him into the lion's den,

38:14.030 --> 38:16.364
we're giving her exactly what she wants.

38:16.366 --> 38:18.833
Now, if I'm the only one thinking this,

38:18.835 --> 38:20.602
I apologize, but...

38:20.604 --> 38:22.704
No. You're not the only one thinking it.

38:22.706 --> 38:24.939
We could send in JJ instead.

38:24.941 --> 38:27.408
Yeah, JJ would have a cooler head.

38:27.410 --> 38:29.544
She'd be better able to
assess Cat's ground game.

38:29.546 --> 38:32.046
And we'd be more likely
to force a mistake

38:32.048 --> 38:33.815
if we throw Cat off from her plan.

38:33.817 --> 38:35.550
Nobody's changing the plan. Am I clear?

38:35.552 --> 38:39.787
If we change the plan, Diana's dead.

38:39.789 --> 38:42.690
If we lose Diana, we lose Reid

38:42.692 --> 38:45.593
from this team forever.

38:45.595 --> 38:47.428
After everything that's happened to him,

38:47.430 --> 38:49.664
after everything that's happened to us,

38:49.666 --> 38:53.067
we've made too many sacrifices for that.

38:53.069 --> 38:56.671
So, this is what we're gonna do.

38:56.673 --> 39:00.908
We are going to take one moment,

39:00.910 --> 39:04.646
one moment of quiet,
one moment of despair,

39:04.648 --> 39:07.148
one moment of doubt,

39:07.150 --> 39:13.087
one moment of hope that Reid
is strong enough for this.

39:19.262 --> 39:21.429
I'll be here the whole time.

39:27.737 --> 39:29.837
Did you all take your moment?

39:29.839 --> 39:31.706
Good.

39:31.708 --> 39:33.341
Now shut it out.

39:33.343 --> 39:35.209
Shut everything out.

39:35.211 --> 39:37.311
Because nothing else matters,

39:37.313 --> 39:39.280
except for her.

39:46.222 --> 39:48.423
Spencie.

39:52.989 --> 39:54.267
