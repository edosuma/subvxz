CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:31.960 --> 00:34.239
Good evening
and welcome to Top Gear

00:34.240 --> 00:37.599
where, tonight, we're talking about
unusual specimens,

00:37.600 --> 00:41.479
not Ant and Wreck over there,
but rare cars.

00:41.480 --> 00:44.239
Because if you want to get
your hands on a truly rare car,

00:44.240 --> 00:46.759
you could spend millions
on a machine like this -

00:46.760 --> 00:51.239
one of 14 right-hand drive
Ferrari 275 GTS.

00:51.240 --> 00:53.319
It's just beautiful. Look at it.

00:53.320 --> 00:55.239
It is nice but you could go
the cheaper route.

00:55.240 --> 00:57.239
If you do a bit of digging,
for not much money,

00:57.240 --> 00:59.359
you can find
some properly rare cars,

00:59.360 --> 01:00.759
the last of their kinds.

01:00.760 --> 01:05.039
Yeah, cars that were once common
but are now nearly extinct.

01:05.040 --> 01:07.879
So, the producers told Fred
and me to go out

01:07.880 --> 01:10.599
and pick the rarest,
cheapest cars we could find

01:10.600 --> 01:12.239
and then meet up with them...

01:12.240 --> 01:14.040
..in Borneo.

01:19.440 --> 01:20.760
Borneo.

01:22.280 --> 01:24.159
A vast jungle island

01:24.160 --> 01:27.399
over three times the size
of Great Britain,

01:27.400 --> 01:29.719
a unique ecosystem that's home

01:29.720 --> 01:32.719
to some of the strangest,
rarest beasts on Earth...

01:32.720 --> 01:34.079
BIRDS TRILL

01:34.080 --> 01:37.000
..and about to be home to two more.

01:49.080 --> 01:53.039
Come on.
PADDY GROANS

01:53.040 --> 01:55.079
Come on.

01:55.080 --> 01:56.960
Ah. Come on!

02:00.040 --> 02:02.159
How are you? Good to see you.

02:02.160 --> 02:05.279
From Bolton. Right...

02:05.280 --> 02:07.359
Oh, cars.

02:07.360 --> 02:09.279
I can't wait to see
what you brought.

02:09.280 --> 02:10.399
Now, let me tell you,

02:10.400 --> 02:12.759
I've been to some very mysterious
parts of the internet

02:12.760 --> 02:14.799
finding this car.
I'm sure you have, Paddy.

02:14.800 --> 02:19.600
This is a proper, rare one-off.
Right.

02:21.400 --> 02:23.159
I give you...

02:23.160 --> 02:26.400
..the Matra Bagheera S.

02:30.720 --> 02:32.599
Feast your eyes on that, son.

02:32.600 --> 02:36.839
Mid-engine, rear-wheel drive,
low centre of gravity -

02:36.840 --> 02:39.159
proper sports car, Fred.

02:39.160 --> 02:40.599
Push-button, nice.

02:40.600 --> 02:42.399
Three seats.

02:42.400 --> 02:45.839
Did somebody say McLaren F1?
No. Yes, I did.

02:45.840 --> 02:47.359
There's only four in the UK.

02:47.360 --> 02:50.879
This is the only right-hand drive
that Matra did theirselves.

02:50.880 --> 02:53.919
And, just for extra points,

02:53.920 --> 02:57.159
this is the original brochure
for this car.

02:57.160 --> 03:00.959
And that car you're looking
at there, the original, is that.

03:00.960 --> 03:03.959
Seriously? That is the same?
That is that, my friend.

03:03.960 --> 03:05.119
Bagheera.

03:05.120 --> 03:07.359
So, it's named after
a Disney character?

03:07.360 --> 03:10.199
I'll forgive your ignorance.
How much?

03:10.200 --> 03:12.079
Six grand, just under.

03:12.080 --> 03:14.959
Six grand.
I'll give you it, it's obscure.

03:14.960 --> 03:17.519
Well, that's the point, Fred.
That's the point.

03:17.520 --> 03:19.399
Is it quick? Quick?!

03:19.400 --> 03:22.119
Oh! 118 top end.

03:22.120 --> 03:24.959
Look at how low this car is.
Look at the ground clearance.

03:24.960 --> 03:27.799
Well, yeah, it's low
because it's a sports car, Fred.

03:27.800 --> 03:29.039
But you're in Borneo.

03:29.040 --> 03:31.199
Have you seen the terrain
you're going to be going on?

03:31.200 --> 03:33.319
This is useless.
I've never been to Borneo before!

03:33.320 --> 03:34.999
I'm not well-travelled like you.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.639
Come here, let me show you this.
This is what you should have had.

03:37.640 --> 03:40.720
This is the car that is going to
wipe the floor with you.

03:41.920 --> 03:43.839
I present to you...

03:43.840 --> 03:46.959
..the Austin Allegro estate.

03:46.960 --> 03:49.359
Both British and exotic.

03:49.360 --> 03:51.639
Well, listen,
I don't want to disappoint you,

03:51.640 --> 03:54.399
but the words "British" and "exotic"
don't go together. Paddy...

03:54.400 --> 03:56.639
It's an Allegro. Oh, no, no, no, no.

03:56.640 --> 03:59.879
I mean, there's loads of them.
No, no, not this Allegro.

03:59.880 --> 04:03.639
This is an estate.
This is rarer, Paddy. Rarer.

04:03.640 --> 04:05.319
Just a couple knocking about.

04:05.320 --> 04:06.879
And it's three and a half grand.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.599
Half the price of that,
more or less.

04:08.600 --> 04:10.719
Yeah, I know it's half the price
cos it's half the car.

04:10.720 --> 04:11.999
Half the price, double the car.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.759
There's no way
that's getting across Borneo.

04:14.760 --> 04:17.999
This is mint. This is as fast as
the day it left the factory.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.440
So, very slow, then.
Faster than yours. Fa...!

04:23.360 --> 04:25.480
Well, we'd soon see.

04:26.720 --> 04:28.359
Three...

04:28.360 --> 04:30.199
..two, one...

04:30.200 --> 04:31.320
..go.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.999
Come on, Matra, let's go.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.919
Oh, bloomin' heck.

04:37.920 --> 04:39.439
I've got the cover on the back.

04:39.440 --> 04:42.159
It's acting like a parachute
as well. That's not happening.

04:42.160 --> 04:44.360
French engineering at its best!

04:47.280 --> 04:49.839
Suppose he's got a bit of drag.
That's what he'll be saying.

04:49.840 --> 04:52.159
"I've got a bit of drag with this
at the back of my car.

04:52.160 --> 04:53.679
"The dust sheet's slowing me down."

04:53.680 --> 04:56.359
Ugh. Look at Paddy. He'll be all
happy with himself.

04:56.360 --> 04:58.720
Well done, Paddy,
you've won in a sports car.

05:00.280 --> 05:05.079
Now, the mission we've been given
for our classics was a simple one -

05:05.080 --> 05:07.559
head up the road out of town

05:07.560 --> 05:09.119
and keep driving

05:09.120 --> 05:11.360
until we could drive no more.

05:13.120 --> 05:15.519
But, just because
the route was simple,

05:15.520 --> 05:17.680
it didn't mean it would be easy.

05:18.960 --> 05:22.999
God. I've literally only just
got off the airstrip

05:23.000 --> 05:25.479
and we're struggling here.

05:25.480 --> 05:28.919
If I was to draw a car I didn't
want to drive around Borneo,

05:28.920 --> 05:30.280
I reckon I'd draw that.

05:31.960 --> 05:34.159
But survive the journey

05:34.160 --> 05:38.319
and we've been told our rare beasts
might just earn themselves a place

05:38.320 --> 05:42.559
in one of the world's most legendary
car collections -

05:42.560 --> 05:45.840
a place that, frankly,
my car was made for.

05:47.160 --> 05:50.119
Matra Bagheera.

05:50.120 --> 05:51.519
Wow.

05:51.520 --> 05:52.919
I love the steering wheel.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.719
I like the little flat bit
at the bottom,

05:54.720 --> 05:56.119
very Lamborghini-esque.

05:56.120 --> 05:58.399
In fact, at its launch,

05:58.400 --> 06:01.679
it was known as
the little Lamborghini,

06:01.680 --> 06:03.160
and I can see why.

06:04.760 --> 06:07.439
Matra is almost forgotten nowadays,

06:07.440 --> 06:12.799
but, 40 years ago,
it led the world in motorsport.

06:12.800 --> 06:17.759
In 1969, Matra won
the F1 World Championships

06:17.760 --> 06:19.759
with Jackie Stewart.

06:19.760 --> 06:21.999
And it won Le Mans three times -

06:22.000 --> 06:25.879
1972, 1973, and 1974.

06:25.880 --> 06:28.160
Proper pedigree, this car.

06:29.400 --> 06:31.119
Phew!

06:31.120 --> 06:33.000
I'm having some of my cooling spray.

06:35.640 --> 06:36.880
Oh.

06:38.120 --> 06:39.319
Bit down here.

06:39.320 --> 06:41.079
Oh, God, a pothole!

06:41.080 --> 06:44.240
Ooh, flipping heck!

06:45.600 --> 06:49.959
Paddy's rushing. This is
the tortoise and the hare, this.

06:49.960 --> 06:52.439
You've brought a sports car
to Borneo.

06:52.440 --> 06:54.919
Go on, you rush around
scratching the bottom,

06:54.920 --> 06:58.359
I'm just going to take it
nice and easy in my Allegro.

06:58.360 --> 07:02.599
Now, this is the HL line
which means it's the posh one.

07:02.600 --> 07:03.999
You get the head rests.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.319
You get a massive quartz clock.

07:06.320 --> 07:08.999
So you can keep
your Bentley Mulsannes

07:09.000 --> 07:11.119
and your Rolls-Royce Phantoms,

07:11.120 --> 07:13.040
this is pure luxury.

07:14.080 --> 07:16.439
After a couple of hours on the road,

07:16.440 --> 07:18.160
our progress was good.

07:19.280 --> 07:21.079
But, heading into the hills,

07:21.080 --> 07:24.199
and still tiptoeing around potholes,

07:24.200 --> 07:28.039
Borneo threw in a new,
unavoidable obstacle -

07:28.040 --> 07:29.480
mud.

07:31.800 --> 07:33.520
Come on, Bagheera.

07:35.920 --> 07:37.999
Oh, God.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.440
Oh, this is tricky.

07:40.840 --> 07:42.439
Oh, my word.

07:42.440 --> 07:44.399
We're going in.

07:44.400 --> 07:45.760
Nice and slow, Pad.

07:46.760 --> 07:50.159
I'm giving it some! How are you
going to get the nose up that hill?

07:50.160 --> 07:52.760
Go on, Bagheera. Go on!

07:53.920 --> 07:55.559
Yes! Yes!

07:55.560 --> 07:57.599
Yes!
PADDY LAUGHS

07:57.600 --> 07:59.119
Whoa!

07:59.120 --> 08:01.119
Up we go!

08:01.120 --> 08:03.479
That is unbelievable!

08:03.480 --> 08:05.679
Woo!

08:05.680 --> 08:07.599
What a car!

08:07.600 --> 08:09.240
Go on.

08:10.440 --> 08:12.399
Oh. Hang on.

08:12.400 --> 08:14.479
I might have pushed the girl
too far.

08:14.480 --> 08:15.880
Let's try this.

08:17.720 --> 08:19.320
Oh, Paddy's stopped.

08:21.360 --> 08:23.239
You right, Pads?

08:23.240 --> 08:24.839
Wha...?

08:24.840 --> 08:27.519
Slight technical.

08:27.520 --> 08:29.559
FLY BUZZES

08:29.560 --> 08:31.999
What the frigging hell's
that in my car?

08:32.000 --> 08:33.440
Get out!

08:35.280 --> 08:36.840
Oh, yes.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.799
Can't believe I've just been
overtaken by an Allegro.

08:42.880 --> 08:44.879
Fred, I might need
a bit of help here.

08:44.880 --> 08:47.919
I might have to get out
and give it a little bit of a shunt.

08:47.920 --> 08:50.159
I tell you what we need,
we need some rocks or something,

08:50.160 --> 08:51.799
don't we, under the wheels?

08:51.800 --> 08:53.519
I'll fish some out.

08:53.520 --> 08:55.720
You sort them out,
I'll get some out of here.

08:56.840 --> 08:59.359
You've got to be careful in here,
though, Paddy.

08:59.360 --> 09:01.919
Any chance of something with
a bit of substantiality to it?

09:01.920 --> 09:04.439
Well, do you want to have a look?
There's all sorts in here.

09:04.440 --> 09:07.639
He brought that out.
What's that going to do?

09:07.640 --> 09:11.119
In here, Paddy, in here
there's tarantulas, right?

09:11.120 --> 09:13.519
Flying snakes.
They're not going to bother you.

09:13.520 --> 09:16.359
Sumatran cobras that spray poison
in your eyes and blind you.

09:16.360 --> 09:19.159
You'll be all right. Black leopards,
stalk you in silence -

09:19.160 --> 09:20.919
one bite on the throat,
you're dead.

09:20.920 --> 09:23.400
You're from Preston,
there's worse round there.

09:25.400 --> 09:27.040
Back, back!

09:28.920 --> 09:31.599
Get a brick under the other side
as well, Fred. Oh, you sit there,

09:31.600 --> 09:33.519
you're all right,
I'll get the bricks.

09:33.520 --> 09:36.239
Well, I'm the pilot, aren't I?
Bloomin' heck.

09:36.240 --> 09:38.279
There's them who sit in the car
and reverse

09:38.280 --> 09:40.679
and there's them who put rocks
under the tyres, son.

09:40.680 --> 09:43.639
ENGINE REVS Go on.

09:43.640 --> 09:45.279
What about giving it a bit of a...

09:45.280 --> 09:47.439
..at the front,
give it a push at the front.

09:47.440 --> 09:49.479
How about you get out
for two minutes?

09:49.480 --> 09:51.479
Lift it!

09:51.480 --> 09:53.280
Oh, that's it, go on, Fred!

09:56.360 --> 09:58.960
It's not even a tonne, this car,
it's lightweight.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.719
Oh.

10:02.720 --> 10:04.799
Stop!

10:04.800 --> 10:06.000
What is it?

10:07.640 --> 10:09.439
It's all right, you don't need it.

10:09.440 --> 10:11.319
Oh, God. You're all right.

10:11.320 --> 10:13.599
Oh, I can't believe that's happened.
It's all right.

10:13.600 --> 10:15.240
40 years, not a scratch.

10:16.840 --> 10:19.599
It had been a busy morning
for the cars,

10:19.600 --> 10:23.840
so, reaching a nearby village,
we decided to stop for a break.

10:26.760 --> 10:29.999
Don't be intimidated
by me getting my arms out.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.359
I'm really not.

10:31.360 --> 10:33.759
Like a dinner lady, look at them.

10:33.760 --> 10:35.679
And, as luck would have it,

10:35.680 --> 10:39.919
we turned up to a highlight
of the local sporting calendar -

10:39.920 --> 10:41.920
buffalo race day.

10:45.720 --> 10:47.719
This is quite a big thing,
isn't it, today?

10:47.720 --> 10:49.200
Get some food here, eh?

10:52.280 --> 10:55.679
Oh, they're off. Pick one, Paddy,
pick one. They're off. Go on.

10:55.680 --> 10:58.039
Number one. Number four, me.

10:58.040 --> 11:00.759
Number four. Yeah, the one
at the front. Come on, number four!

11:00.760 --> 11:03.159
Go on, lad! Come on, number four!

11:03.160 --> 11:05.319
Go on, number one! Go on, one!

11:05.320 --> 11:07.319
He's got him. Oh, no!

11:07.320 --> 11:08.839
Oh! Four.

11:08.840 --> 11:11.560
That was four. Four by a nose.

11:13.080 --> 11:14.879
Good job I've got these on. Oh!

11:14.880 --> 11:16.559
Have you not got them?
No, I haven't.

11:16.560 --> 11:18.479
You know, you just make them
into shorts.

11:18.480 --> 11:20.560
Get a bit of air to your legs,
you see, Fred.

11:22.680 --> 11:25.079
And, by the time the second race
was over,

11:25.080 --> 11:27.880
Freddie had found
the on-site catering.

11:29.480 --> 11:32.400
Ooh, exotic. Got a bit of fruit.
Durian fruit.

11:33.440 --> 11:34.959
Chatting to the fella... Pfft!

11:34.960 --> 11:37.079
You all right? Please stop
putting it under my nose.

11:37.080 --> 11:38.759
It's very prickly.
Whoa! What you doing?

11:38.760 --> 11:41.559
The texture's like... Do you know
when you get a cheese slice melted?

11:41.560 --> 11:43.439
Yeah. That's the texture of it.

11:43.440 --> 11:45.519
Phwoah, man, that smells.

11:45.520 --> 11:47.879
Go on. What do you mean "go on"?

11:47.880 --> 11:50.079
Hang on. You said you were hungry.
Wait a minute.

11:50.080 --> 11:51.800
Yeah, I wanted a...

11:53.000 --> 11:54.320
It's all right.

11:56.320 --> 11:58.839
You're struggling. Tell you what...
You're struggling!

11:58.840 --> 12:00.599
I tell you what...

12:00.600 --> 12:02.960
PADDY LAUGHS
No, it's fine, Paddy. You went...

12:04.400 --> 12:05.639
Oh.

12:05.640 --> 12:09.719
It was just a surprise.
No, I'm all right. Come on! No.

12:09.720 --> 12:12.199
Just tasted some.
Take them away. No...

12:12.200 --> 12:15.559
Say no offence when you go over,
just say... tell them I'm a vegan.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.160
Yep.

12:18.360 --> 12:20.239
There you are.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.639
Pass it down.

12:21.640 --> 12:23.199
Thank you. You're welcome.

12:23.200 --> 12:26.479
Got these sago grubs.
What the f...! What's that?

12:26.480 --> 12:28.599
Sago grubs, they're a delicacy.

12:28.600 --> 12:31.239
They're alive, man.
You said you wanted protein.

12:31.240 --> 12:33.799
Oh, no, I can't... I mean,
look at them, they're quite cute.

12:33.800 --> 12:35.839
If I have one, will you have one?
We're not eight.

12:35.840 --> 12:38.039
But we're in it together, aren't we?
We are not eight.

12:38.040 --> 12:40.439
Put your hand there and I'll
put my hand there and all that.

12:40.440 --> 12:41.839
What are you doing?

12:41.840 --> 12:44.439
You need to live a little, Paddy.
What are you doing? I can't...

12:44.440 --> 12:46.640
I tell you what,
it's a funny feeling, that.

12:47.840 --> 12:49.360
Oh, look at that. Go on.

12:52.920 --> 12:55.599
Fuelled up
on his high protein... grub,

12:55.600 --> 12:58.840
next, Flintoff fancied his chances
out on the track.

13:00.200 --> 13:03.040
CHEERING

13:04.480 --> 13:06.839
What the hell is he doing?

13:06.840 --> 13:09.639
Over here. Come on.

13:09.640 --> 13:11.799
Paddy, lad, I'm in the lead!

13:11.800 --> 13:13.639
Go on! I'm winning.

13:13.640 --> 13:17.319
Oh! Oh! Oh, no. Come on.

13:17.320 --> 13:20.719
But, before Freddie Dettori could do
himself or a buffalo

13:20.720 --> 13:22.199
a career-ending injury,

13:22.200 --> 13:24.320
I thought it best
we get back on the move.

13:27.920 --> 13:31.599
And, once again, picking our way
along the only road north,

13:31.600 --> 13:33.479
the afternoon played out...

13:33.480 --> 13:36.120
..well, pretty much
as the morning had.

13:37.160 --> 13:38.479
Come on.

13:38.480 --> 13:40.519
Right, wait there,
I'm going to give you a push.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.719
Hang on, I might have that.

13:42.720 --> 13:44.679
Try that. BLEEP, BLEEP.

13:44.680 --> 13:46.800
Paddy, wait! I'll tell you when!

13:47.840 --> 13:51.799
Oh, come on. Come on, Bagheera.

13:51.800 --> 13:53.359
Oh-ho!

13:53.360 --> 13:55.719
First gear's gone in! Yes!

13:55.720 --> 13:58.039
That's the first time to...

13:58.040 --> 14:01.559
What in the name of God is this?

14:01.560 --> 14:04.279
Where did that come from? Oh!

14:04.280 --> 14:07.159
Oh, my God, that's savage.

14:07.160 --> 14:08.759
Flippin' heck!

14:08.760 --> 14:12.199
I can't even get it into a gear.
Pump, pump, pump.

14:12.200 --> 14:14.600
Bloody thing's cut out on me.

14:15.920 --> 14:17.639
Oh, no.

14:17.640 --> 14:19.439
I've no engine.

14:19.440 --> 14:21.320
Oh! Oh!

14:22.440 --> 14:24.039
Oh, God. Argh!

14:24.040 --> 14:27.039
Oh, there's bloody flies
coming in at me. Oh!

14:27.040 --> 14:28.159
Argh!

14:28.160 --> 14:29.679
Oh!

14:29.680 --> 14:32.600
HE PANTS

14:36.160 --> 14:39.319
Either this has got heated seats...

14:39.320 --> 14:41.360
..or I've just had an accident.

14:43.440 --> 14:47.159
Look at this.
No pride in his car whatsoever.

14:47.160 --> 14:50.440
Look at that. He doesn't care,
McGuinness, he doesn't care.

14:52.160 --> 14:53.519
When did that come off?

14:53.520 --> 14:55.599
Down that hill.
I stopped to pick it up.

14:55.600 --> 14:57.399
HORN BEEPS Oh, look at this.

14:57.400 --> 14:58.919
We're holding up the road here.

14:58.920 --> 15:02.079
It's all right, they'll see that
and they'll go, "Oh, bit of class.

15:02.080 --> 15:03.879
"He's a Matra driver."

15:03.880 --> 15:06.719
"Look at that knobhead
driving that French car."

15:06.720 --> 15:10.039
Need a push up, boys.
Do you reckon you can push...?

15:10.040 --> 15:12.159
You fancy helping us push this,
please?

15:12.160 --> 15:14.159
Need a push, need a push.

15:14.160 --> 15:17.159
Who's the lightest, smallest?
The small one.

15:17.160 --> 15:19.239
This lad here. Get yourself in.

15:19.240 --> 15:20.999
You steer, we'll push.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.520
That's it.

15:23.680 --> 15:26.839
Just before we go, it's the only
right-hand drive Bagheera, that,

15:26.840 --> 15:28.679
made by Matra. Are we ready?

15:28.680 --> 15:30.279
Right, lads, come on. That's it.

15:30.280 --> 15:31.799
Push! Oh, we're on it,
we're on it!

15:31.800 --> 15:34.439
Come on, lads, come on.
Let's go, come on!

15:34.440 --> 15:36.399
Yes, lads, come on, push!

15:36.400 --> 15:38.239
THEY LAUGH

15:38.240 --> 15:39.839
Oh-whey-oh!

15:39.840 --> 15:41.680
Oh-oh-oh!

15:43.960 --> 15:45.399
And, just to be clear,

15:45.400 --> 15:48.439
while Paddy was busy
deconstructing his Bagheera...

15:48.440 --> 15:49.599
Oh!

15:49.600 --> 15:51.319
Ooh!

15:51.320 --> 15:54.319
Oh, no, there goes
my rear view mirror. That's gone.

15:54.320 --> 15:56.439
..the Allegro 1.5 HL

15:56.440 --> 15:58.760
hadn't missed a beat.

15:59.840 --> 16:01.439
Here we go.

16:01.440 --> 16:04.159
I've had 4x4s that can't do this.

16:04.160 --> 16:07.319
BMW X5, I couldn't get it
off the drive when it snowed.

16:07.320 --> 16:08.919
Me drive was only like that.

16:08.920 --> 16:10.919
Look at this!

16:10.920 --> 16:12.399
I tell you what,

16:12.400 --> 16:13.959
the people at British Leyland,

16:13.960 --> 16:16.279
they had a bad reputation
for going home early.

16:16.280 --> 16:18.399
Not the bloke
who put this one together.

16:18.400 --> 16:20.479
He stayed on a Friday.

16:20.480 --> 16:25.199
He thought, "One day, my car
is going to be driven

16:25.200 --> 16:28.720
"by a fat, ex-cricketer
with ginger hair through Borneo."

16:30.320 --> 16:31.960
As the day wore on...

16:33.040 --> 16:36.360
..eventually
the light began to fade.

16:42.240 --> 16:43.759
Oh, God.

16:43.760 --> 16:49.480
Poor visibility, head lamps
from the '70s, and it's raining.

16:50.840 --> 16:52.240
Bloomin' heck.

16:53.360 --> 16:55.959
Oh, no, what's happened
to my wipers?

16:55.960 --> 16:57.640
I've lost a wiper.

16:59.240 --> 17:04.239
But we'd been told to drive
until we could drive no more,

17:04.240 --> 17:07.000
so, that's exactly what we did.

17:10.400 --> 17:12.279
How are you feeling, big lad?

17:12.280 --> 17:14.799
Oh, I'm ready for my pit, son.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.480
Me and you both.

17:26.599 --> 17:28.240
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:29.640 --> 17:31.280
What is...?

17:34.240 --> 17:36.000
What's going on?

17:39.720 --> 17:40.960
Hello.

17:42.840 --> 17:44.160
OK.

17:51.440 --> 17:53.280
Paddy, I think these are Gurkhas.

17:54.720 --> 17:56.320
Just be good.

17:57.600 --> 17:59.680
Sir? Yes. This is for you.

18:03.800 --> 18:05.999
Hoo! What did he say, Paddy?
What's he after?

18:06.000 --> 18:08.279
Didn't say owt to me.

18:08.280 --> 18:11.839
"Tomorrow, you will face
the ultimate test.

18:11.840 --> 18:15.799
"With the help of the army's elite
shock force troop, the Gurkhas,

18:15.800 --> 18:18.159
"you're going off-road,

18:18.160 --> 18:20.280
"really off-road."

18:26.520 --> 18:29.200
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

18:31.040 --> 18:34.239
What was that? What's that?
Why's he doing that?

18:34.240 --> 18:37.879
Don't worry about that.
It's horrible. It's horrible. OK.

18:37.880 --> 18:41.479
Congratulations, Andrew, you are
definitely moving up in the world.

18:41.480 --> 18:43.919
You've gone from pedalo to buffalo.

18:43.920 --> 18:46.679
Firstly, it's Fred till
I tell you otherwise. OK, sorry.

18:46.680 --> 18:49.719
And the other thing, buffaloes
are easier to stay on than a pedalo.

18:49.720 --> 18:52.159
It does help being sober as well.
LAUGHTER

18:52.160 --> 18:53.799
I'm not going to lie.

18:53.800 --> 18:57.039
We'll get back to that film
and the Gurkhas a little later,

18:57.040 --> 19:00.279
and, let me tell you,
those lads do not mess about.

19:00.280 --> 19:03.399
Now, while these two were off
flouncing around in the jungle,

19:03.400 --> 19:07.359
I was busy doing some real world
consumer journalism,

19:07.360 --> 19:11.200
a very thorough review
of the new Rolls-Royce.

19:23.440 --> 19:26.439
It's called the Cullinan.

19:26.440 --> 19:29.279
It costs a quarter of
a million pounds.

19:29.280 --> 19:31.879
And, though it might
look like an SUV,

19:31.880 --> 19:35.399
according to Rolls, it isn't an SUV.

19:35.400 --> 19:40.320
No, this is an all-terrain,
high-bodied car.

19:41.760 --> 19:44.759
So, an SUV, then.

19:44.760 --> 19:48.159
And to all those people saying,
"Should Rolls-Royce really build

19:48.160 --> 19:49.719
"a massive SUV?"

19:49.720 --> 19:51.919
I say, well, why not?

19:51.920 --> 19:57.239
If anyone's entitled to build
a massive, off-road tank, it's them.

19:57.240 --> 20:00.240
It's hardly like their normal cars
are small and dainty, is it?

20:01.240 --> 20:03.159
Furthermore, 100 years ago,

20:03.160 --> 20:06.639
Rolls' entire
best-car-in-the-world image

20:06.640 --> 20:08.999
was based on a building
off-road vehicles because

20:09.000 --> 20:10.919
there were no roads.

20:10.920 --> 20:13.120
Just ask Lawrence of Arabia.

20:14.720 --> 20:17.999
And the Cullinan
is a proper off-roader.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.719
It's got four-wheel-drive,

20:19.720 --> 20:22.359
it'll wade through
half a metre of water,

20:22.360 --> 20:25.879
it'll realistically go
anywhere you'd expect

20:25.880 --> 20:29.039
your £250,000 off-roader to go.

20:29.040 --> 20:30.839
But, let's face it,

20:30.840 --> 20:34.119
the Cullinan owner
isn't going to do any of that.

20:34.120 --> 20:36.399
They're going
to drive around on-road,

20:36.400 --> 20:38.479
from this very high
driving position,

20:38.480 --> 20:41.280
wondering why everyone else
looks a bit poor.

20:46.320 --> 20:47.959
And, out on the road,

20:47.960 --> 20:52.279
the Cullinan is every bit as refined
and imperious as you'd expect

20:52.280 --> 20:55.400
from the world's most expensive SUV.

20:58.840 --> 21:03.439
Listen to that.
The silence is just glorious.

21:03.440 --> 21:07.640
This is the most refined
SUV ever made.

21:09.520 --> 21:11.879
You really don't even know
the engine's switched on.

21:11.880 --> 21:15.039
I mean, driving on this road now,
there's no suspension noise,

21:15.040 --> 21:16.600
no tyre noise.

21:17.760 --> 21:21.039
And the ride,
it's just extraordinary.

21:21.040 --> 21:23.039
It is so supple,

21:23.040 --> 21:26.239
it's like the road ahead of you's
just been resurfaced

21:26.240 --> 21:28.319
with marshmallows.

21:28.320 --> 21:31.839
And, like every other
luxury SUV out there,

21:31.840 --> 21:34.640
the Cullinan
doesn't just do comfort...

21:35.720 --> 21:37.719
..it also does power.

21:37.720 --> 21:40.799
And it really is
more than powerful enough.

21:40.800 --> 21:44.959
It has a twin-turbo-charged
6.75 litre V12,

21:44.960 --> 21:47.439
560hp.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.679
I'm not sure anyone is going to be
brave enough

21:49.680 --> 21:52.119
to really hustle one of these,
though.

21:52.120 --> 21:55.199
It goes really, really quickly.

21:55.200 --> 21:57.679
And it does a great job of hiding
all of its weight

21:57.680 --> 22:01.079
until you get to a corner
like that...

22:01.080 --> 22:03.119
TYRES SCREECH

22:03.120 --> 22:05.640
..and you are very aware
of how heavy it is.

22:07.920 --> 22:12.239
Let's be honest,
this isn't an SUV for driving hard,

22:12.240 --> 22:16.920
it's an SUV for wafting along
in glorious, soothing silence.

22:17.960 --> 22:21.800
And, for that, the Cullinan is
in a class of its own.

22:23.920 --> 22:28.400
However, it does have
one, teeny-tiny problem.

22:29.640 --> 22:33.119
It is, to use
a technical, automotive term,

22:33.120 --> 22:35.799
utterly hideous to look at.

22:35.800 --> 22:39.279
I mean, it's a little bit
new London taxi there,

22:39.280 --> 22:41.359
it's a little bit Chinese knock-off,

22:41.360 --> 22:43.359
it's ALL bad.

22:43.360 --> 22:45.119
I mean, look at the grille.

22:45.120 --> 22:46.719
All that money, that design team,

22:46.720 --> 22:48.479
that's the best
they can come up with?

22:48.480 --> 22:50.959
It just looks like they've taken
any old boxy SUV

22:50.960 --> 22:53.679
and just slapped a grille on it
and a flying lady.

22:53.680 --> 22:55.199
She must be gutted.

22:55.200 --> 22:57.719
And I know looks are
a subjective thing,

22:57.720 --> 22:59.399
but this is just wrong.

22:59.400 --> 23:02.359
In fact, I'm going to get inside
cos it's safer on my eyes.

23:02.360 --> 23:03.520
Argh!

23:04.720 --> 23:07.359
It really is quite an achievement.

23:07.360 --> 23:12.079
Rolls has somehow managed to build
a £250,000 car

23:12.080 --> 23:15.640
that turns heads
for all the wrong reasons.

23:17.120 --> 23:19.319
♪ Hallelujah... ♪

23:19.320 --> 23:21.399
Sorry. Sorry.

23:21.400 --> 23:24.399
♪ Hallelujah, hallelujah... ♪

23:24.400 --> 23:26.479
It's not my car.

23:26.480 --> 23:28.839
♪ Hallelujah

23:28.840 --> 23:31.839
♪ Hallelujah, hallelujah

23:31.840 --> 23:34.359
♪ Hallelujah. ♪

23:34.360 --> 23:37.960
But there's something much worse
going on here.

23:39.680 --> 23:43.679
The Cullinan should feel like
the peak of British engineering

23:43.680 --> 23:46.519
but, actually,
it just feels cynical.

23:46.520 --> 23:50.479
It doesn't feel like it was created
through passion, or love,

23:50.480 --> 23:55.759
or innovation, it just feels like
it was created to make money.

23:55.760 --> 23:57.959
Raw greed.

23:57.960 --> 23:59.479
Because, let's face it,

23:59.480 --> 24:02.599
there are too many rich people
on this planet

24:02.600 --> 24:05.200
for this tasteless car not to exist.

24:08.480 --> 24:10.799
I'm an apologist for the motor car -

24:10.800 --> 24:14.639
fast, big, inefficient,
I'll defend them cos I love cars,

24:14.640 --> 24:16.559
I'm passionate about them.

24:16.560 --> 24:19.920
But I cannot construct
a defence for this car.

24:21.040 --> 24:24.479
I'm in the flag-bearer
for British engineering,

24:24.480 --> 24:26.959
a Rolls-Royce,

24:26.960 --> 24:28.440
and I'm ashamed to be in it.

24:30.440 --> 24:32.239
So, if you want to experience

24:32.240 --> 24:34.919
a world-class piece
of British engineering

24:34.920 --> 24:37.479
that doesn't make
you loath yourself,

24:37.480 --> 24:39.039
you don't want one of these.

24:39.040 --> 24:40.240
Oh, no.

24:41.360 --> 24:44.720
You want one of these.

24:46.200 --> 24:49.600
Now, that is British engineering.
Watch this.

24:50.640 --> 24:53.199
The Brompton folding bicycle.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.839
What a machine.

24:54.840 --> 24:57.480
Frankly, it's a blessed relief.

25:12.040 --> 25:14.240
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

25:15.960 --> 25:17.839
I mean, I'm not...

25:17.840 --> 25:20.719
I'm not being...

25:20.720 --> 25:24.119
I do have to point out
there's no Cullinan.

25:24.120 --> 25:25.999
There are no flies on you, Fred.
Where is it?

25:26.000 --> 25:27.999
Your powers of observation
are amazing.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.839
Look, we asked Rolls-Royce
if we could borrow one,

25:30.840 --> 25:32.799
they said no, so we had to rent one.

25:32.800 --> 25:35.719
And they said no cos they were
worried - I don't know why -

25:35.720 --> 25:38.399
they thought we were going to be
rude about it.

25:38.400 --> 25:40.239
You were rude about it.

25:40.240 --> 25:42.839
Oh, come on, I think we just
pointed out the obvious, didn't we?

25:42.840 --> 25:45.519
Look, it deserves a kicking and
they're not the only ones, either.

25:45.520 --> 25:49.119
Everyone's making
these big, large, executive SUVs.

25:49.120 --> 25:51.639
You know, Aston Martin's at it,
Lamborghini's done it,

25:51.640 --> 25:54.479
Bentley's done it, but there's
something about the Rolls

25:54.480 --> 25:56.959
that makes it more hateful
than all the others.

25:56.960 --> 25:59.359
It's just hideous to look at.
It's not that bad.

25:59.360 --> 26:01.719
In comparison to the Bentley
and the Lambo,

26:01.720 --> 26:03.239
I'd have it every day of the week.

26:03.240 --> 26:05.239
Oh. It's Rolls-Royce, Paddy.

26:05.240 --> 26:07.279
British at its best. Oh, no.

26:07.280 --> 26:09.319
I'm sorry, are you having a laugh?
No.

26:09.320 --> 26:11.879
You would drive around in that car?
Mate, what's wrong with it?

26:11.880 --> 26:14.399
Tell you what, then, you open
the boot, you get a Brompton out,

26:14.400 --> 26:16.999
there's nothing more pretentious
on the road than a Brompton.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.039
"Look at me on my foldy-up bike."
No, I've got to...

26:19.040 --> 26:21.319
LAUGHTER Jeez, come on, Chris...

26:21.320 --> 26:24.399
Shall we move on? Cos now it's time
for tonight's studio guest,

26:24.400 --> 26:26.439
the fantastic Bob Mortimer.

26:26.440 --> 26:29.279
Here's what happened when we met him
out on the track earlier today.

26:29.280 --> 26:31.159
Behave, you two.
You can have some as well.

26:31.160 --> 26:33.319
APPLAUSE

26:33.320 --> 26:36.479
Hello, Bob. Hiya, Paddy.
Hiya, Freddie. Hiya, Chris.

26:36.480 --> 26:38.159
How are you, boss?
Thanks for having us.

26:38.160 --> 26:41.519
Welcome to the Top Gear
Width Restrictor challenge, OK?

26:41.520 --> 26:43.639
Right. Very, very simple. Yeah.

26:43.640 --> 26:45.279
You've got to take this car... Yeah.

26:45.280 --> 26:47.839
..and you've got to drive through
there as fast as you can,

26:47.840 --> 26:50.199
and you have to nominate someone
to compete against.

26:50.200 --> 26:51.719
Might I suggest you choose

26:51.720 --> 26:53.879
the person you think
might be the slowest.

26:53.880 --> 26:55.839
Paddy. Oh!
FREDDIE LAUGHS

26:55.840 --> 26:58.279
Ooh. Oh, he's not happy with that.

26:58.280 --> 27:01.319
Here we go. Great car, this.
Come on.

27:01.320 --> 27:04.199
Sport mode -
Bob won't think of that.

27:04.200 --> 27:05.759
This is how competitive Paddy is,

27:05.760 --> 27:08.719
he started way back
so he can get some speed up.

27:08.720 --> 27:10.359
She's an old girl.

27:10.360 --> 27:12.719
Come on. 70.

27:12.720 --> 27:13.879
He suits the Jag.

27:13.880 --> 27:16.399
I can imagine him in one of those
lurking around wine bars.

27:16.400 --> 27:17.839
Yeah. Sort of Watford area.

27:17.840 --> 27:20.600
100, we're at 100. We're at 100.
We're at 100.

27:22.040 --> 27:24.479
Oh! He's through, Bob.

27:24.480 --> 27:26.839
Ooh, that were tight!

27:26.840 --> 27:28.880
TYRES SCREECH

27:30.360 --> 27:32.279
Well, I was very impressed.

27:32.280 --> 27:34.039
She'll go, the old girl.

27:34.040 --> 27:36.439
That was impressive. Go on.

27:36.440 --> 27:38.159
101!

27:38.160 --> 27:41.879
Race you back. Beat that, Sir Bob.
I won't. Beat that.

27:41.880 --> 27:45.319
Now, did you touch anything? Well,
little nick on the wing mirror.

27:45.320 --> 27:48.119
Oh, hello. Oh, oh. No, no. Whoa.

27:48.120 --> 27:51.679
It's intact, look.
Is the glass smashed? No.

27:51.680 --> 27:54.279
There you go. Get off that.
So I think that does count.

27:54.280 --> 27:56.479
101mph is your speed to beat, Bob.

27:56.480 --> 27:58.079
Well, I won't be beating that.

27:58.080 --> 28:01.039
Do you want me to try and do 100mph?
I want you to beat Paddy.

28:01.040 --> 28:02.919
BOB LAUGHS
I really want you to beat Paddy.

28:02.920 --> 28:04.999
Three, two, one, go.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.640
Come on, Bob. Don't lift off.

28:08.160 --> 28:11.319
They're barely moving.
I can't even pick... Oh, 36.

28:11.320 --> 28:13.999
I am a sinner! 70! Come on, go, Bob!

28:14.000 --> 28:15.919
Go! I'm nervous.

28:15.920 --> 28:17.479
I don't normally... BLEEP!

28:17.480 --> 28:18.839
No, Bob, no.

28:18.840 --> 28:20.399
No!

28:20.400 --> 28:22.719
Oh! You got through, Bob!

28:22.720 --> 28:24.239
THEY LAUGH

28:24.240 --> 28:26.479
Did you have the handbrake on,
Bob, or what?

28:26.480 --> 28:28.719
In Bob's mind, we were supersonic.

28:28.720 --> 28:31.199
It was... Bob, we didn't need
the speed camera.

28:31.200 --> 28:34.039
Oh, I know,
but I've joyed myself so much.

28:34.040 --> 28:36.799
Honest.
THEY LAUGH

28:36.800 --> 28:39.119
It's not all about speed, is it?

28:39.120 --> 28:42.079
That's the first time
I've been frightened in a long time.

28:42.080 --> 28:43.799
First of all,
can I announce your speed?

28:43.800 --> 28:45.639
What do you think you did?
Oh, I think I...

28:45.640 --> 28:48.559
I really want it to be 60 but...
Yes! Oh, it is?

28:48.560 --> 28:52.199
Oh! Oh, that's all right!
That's all right! Get in!

28:52.200 --> 28:54.599
That's all right!
And one point of conjecture,

28:54.600 --> 28:57.599
you went through at 60,
you didn't touch anything. No.

28:57.600 --> 29:00.159
He may have done 101
but he whacked a wing mirror,

29:00.160 --> 29:03.200
so I'm not sure that you haven't
scored a moral victory here.

29:05.560 --> 29:08.039
He's chuffed with himself,
isn't he? Oh, all the time.

29:08.040 --> 29:09.199
For no apparent reason.

29:09.200 --> 29:12.079
Just shows that sometimes the
tortoise beats the hare, doesn't it?

29:12.080 --> 29:15.279
Yeah. Sometimes the bull
beats the kestrel.

29:15.280 --> 29:18.399
THEY LAUGH
Do you know what I mean?

29:18.400 --> 29:21.040
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

29:22.240 --> 29:26.319
Please welcome comedy legend
Bob Mortimer!

29:26.320 --> 29:28.919
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

29:28.920 --> 29:32.360
Hi, Paddy. Hi, Chris. Hiya, Freddie.

29:33.840 --> 29:35.599
Oh! Whoa!

29:35.600 --> 29:37.839
Thanks for having us.

29:37.840 --> 29:40.359
That was tight.
That was tight, yeah.

29:40.360 --> 29:43.279
You went fast at first and then
you took your foot off the gas, why?

29:43.280 --> 29:44.759
Yes, I got frightened.

29:44.760 --> 29:46.799
Right, OK. YOU got frightened?

29:46.800 --> 29:49.279
I was bricking it
in that passenger seat. Yes.

29:49.280 --> 29:51.119
I kind of smelt that, yes.

29:51.120 --> 29:54.079
LAUGHTER
Kind of. Apologies.

29:54.080 --> 29:57.559
But let's start at the beginning.
Yeah. What was your first car?

29:57.560 --> 30:01.959
My first car was a Lexus LS400.

30:01.960 --> 30:06.319
Big. That's a very big,
not-normal, first car.

30:06.320 --> 30:09.319
When did you pass your driving
test? Not till my late 30s.

30:09.320 --> 30:12.599
You know, when, my wife was having
a baby, so you think,

30:12.600 --> 30:15.639
you know, you might have to drive
to the hospital.

30:15.640 --> 30:17.439
Drive to the hospital... It helps.

30:17.440 --> 30:19.599
Yeah, with some towels
and some hot water

30:19.600 --> 30:22.639
on the back-seat, so I thought
I'd have to learn, so, yeah.

30:22.640 --> 30:25.799
So, what's this, then?
Cos we've got footage of you

30:25.800 --> 30:27.359
driving in the mid-'90s.

30:27.360 --> 30:29.320
Really? Yeah, let's have
a look at this.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.239
Nicole!

30:38.240 --> 30:40.159
Nicole!

30:40.160 --> 30:41.320
HE MOUTHS

30:42.680 --> 30:44.439
Papa. Nicole.

30:44.440 --> 30:46.919
Nicole! Bob!

30:46.920 --> 30:48.120
Yes!

30:50.560 --> 30:51.840
Blimey!

30:58.000 --> 30:59.119
Yeah.

30:59.120 --> 31:01.879
Oh! What about that?!

31:01.880 --> 31:04.639
What a lovely memory.

31:04.640 --> 31:07.879
That was the most viewing figures

31:07.880 --> 31:10.679
Vic and I have ever got, was for
that advert. How million?

31:10.680 --> 31:14.359
There's 24 million people watched
that. Extraordinary, isn't it?

31:14.360 --> 31:16.439
That advert was massive
back in the day. Yeah.

31:16.440 --> 31:18.679
In fact, you're advert royalty.
I didn't know this.

31:18.680 --> 31:20.719
This is amazing, everybody.

31:20.720 --> 31:25.039
Bob used to be the voice of
Churchill the dog from the adverts.

31:25.040 --> 31:27.440
I can't believe it!
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

31:30.400 --> 31:33.239
Oh, yes.
CHEERING

31:33.240 --> 31:35.359
Yes! Yes!

31:35.360 --> 31:38.519
LAUGHTER Yes!

31:38.520 --> 31:41.959
Yeah, we went into a voice booth
and they had this character,

31:41.960 --> 31:45.039
a dog, and said, "Can you come up
with a voice for it?"

31:45.040 --> 31:48.719
And I also, do you remember Deryck
Guyler? "Oh, what you doing?"

31:48.720 --> 31:51.159
Yeah. I did it like that

31:51.160 --> 31:53.839
and that became kind of what
I'm best known for,

31:53.840 --> 31:55.719
although I'm not known
for it as it were.

31:55.720 --> 31:58.799
How long did you do it for, those
adverts? I did it for a long time.

31:58.800 --> 32:01.439
For, I'm thinking, like,
ten years or something.

32:01.440 --> 32:04.319
Did they just keep getting you back
in or did you just use it, because

32:04.320 --> 32:06.959
it's just the same, "Oh, yes,"
it's just that on every advert.

32:06.960 --> 32:09.479
Every time I'd have to go in
and do an, "Oh, yes.

32:09.480 --> 32:12.279
"Oh, yes! Oh, yes."

32:12.280 --> 32:14.319
You know, with those instructions.

32:14.320 --> 32:16.479
"Say this one like you're sad."

32:16.480 --> 32:18.359
"Oh, yes."

32:18.360 --> 32:20.079
THEY LAUGH

32:20.080 --> 32:23.719
But, yeah, I'd have to, so they must
have thousands upon thousands of,

32:23.720 --> 32:26.599
"Oh, yes," somewhere. Brilliant.
Shall we talk about your new show,

32:26.600 --> 32:28.159
Gone Fishing with Paul Whitehouse.

32:28.160 --> 32:31.279
Oh, thank you, yeah. Now, I'm not
massively into fishing.

32:31.280 --> 32:34.639
I mean, I've done a little bit,
but I love the show.

32:34.640 --> 32:36.999
Why do you think it's been
so successful? Do you know what?

32:37.000 --> 32:40.119
I think it's a little bit of what
Last Of The Summer Wine used

32:40.120 --> 32:42.999
to have. It's older fellas,
it's very gentle.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.999
It comes across on camera that you
genuinely love it, though.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.079
I absolutely adore it.

32:48.080 --> 32:50.679
It's, like, not the fishing as such.

32:50.680 --> 32:53.039
I adore at my age just being away.

32:53.040 --> 32:55.359
It's like being 15 again
with your best mate. Yeah.

32:55.360 --> 32:57.959
Messing around on a river bank.
Yeah.

32:57.960 --> 33:00.559
Going to the boozer afterwards.
Yeah. Having a pie,

33:00.560 --> 33:03.599
cos the wife's not there,
so she won't stop me eating pies.

33:03.600 --> 33:06.439
Oh, have you been put on a stop
with pies, have you?

33:06.440 --> 33:09.719
Yeah, cos of me heart stuff, I'm not
allowed to eat anything nice.

33:09.720 --> 33:11.279
LAUGHTER

33:11.280 --> 33:14.279
The second series is on later on
this summer as well.

33:14.280 --> 33:17.479
Summer, yeah. I think we've got
a clip, actually. Let's have a look.

33:17.480 --> 33:20.279
Bob. Oh, have a drink from that.
PAUL CHUCKLES

33:20.280 --> 33:22.039
Isn't it glorious? That's fantastic.

33:22.040 --> 33:25.880
It's a par four this, Paul, which
means it should take four minutes.

33:27.720 --> 33:30.160
BOB LAUGHS

33:32.840 --> 33:35.119
I'm sorry, I shouldn't laugh, Paul.

33:35.120 --> 33:36.359
I shouldn't laugh.

33:36.360 --> 33:38.320
And nor should you,
you should be ashamed.

33:39.640 --> 33:41.400
BOB SNIGGERS

33:47.840 --> 33:49.559
Whoa! Straight in the rough!

33:49.560 --> 33:51.559
Well, I'm not using what you used.

33:51.560 --> 33:53.079
What did you use?

33:53.080 --> 33:55.279
Look at the size of this!

33:55.280 --> 33:57.639
I bet he's played it before.

33:57.640 --> 34:00.280
No-one's been...
PAUL LAUGHS

34:01.480 --> 34:03.520
Come on, hapless Bob.

34:04.480 --> 34:08.040
Whoa! WHOA! LOOK AT IT GO!
Where did it go?

34:09.719 --> 34:12.639
Nobody knows. No!

34:12.639 --> 34:14.520
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

34:18.880 --> 34:22.559
Bob, Bob, you're golfing there,
obviously, you fish. Historically,

34:22.560 --> 34:25.918
you're doing boring things
but making them look really fun.

34:25.920 --> 34:29.438
Do you fancy having a crack
at cricket?
LAUGHTER

34:29.440 --> 34:31.918
Anyway, it's time to see your lap.

34:31.920 --> 34:34.438
Thank you. How did you find
the GT86?

34:34.440 --> 34:39.079
Phwoar! Well, when I went round with
Stig, I found it terrifying,

34:39.080 --> 34:43.639
but, actually, when I was at the
controls, not so much. Not really.

34:43.639 --> 34:45.039
It's interesting, Stig.

34:45.040 --> 34:47.918
You're trying to work out what or
who he is, you know? Yeah.

34:47.920 --> 34:50.199
He's got very thin thighs,
have you noticed?

34:50.199 --> 34:53.159
He's really thin. Made me think,
"Maybe he's part thrush?"

34:53.159 --> 34:55.000
LAUGHTER

34:57.040 --> 35:00.959
Anyway, who'd like to see Bob's
lap? Yes! Come on. All right.

35:00.960 --> 35:02.919
Let's take a look.

35:02.920 --> 35:06.639
Off the line. I'm not going to say
much here, cos Bob's ace.

35:06.640 --> 35:08.639
IN GEORDIE ACCENT: Howie, Mickey,

35:08.640 --> 35:11.640
let's go down the retail park
and do some doughnuts.

35:12.800 --> 35:16.439
And then have some chicken and throw
the bones at Halfords.

35:16.440 --> 35:19.319
Were you just in your own little
world at this point?

35:19.320 --> 35:21.199
To be honest with you, yeah.

35:21.200 --> 35:24.319
I mean, it doesn't look quick.
No, it's not quick, I'm sure.

35:24.320 --> 35:26.520
It's doing these sorts of speeds...

35:27.880 --> 35:31.039
..that mean that you miss
the price reductions

35:31.040 --> 35:33.280
on the pasties and the pies.

35:35.160 --> 35:37.399
Pasty gone! Pie gone!

35:37.400 --> 35:39.400
Too fast, boy!

35:42.200 --> 35:44.199
He's coming in to hammerhead now.

35:44.200 --> 35:46.400
It doesn't look quick
but it's controlled.

35:47.520 --> 35:50.439
He was a late entrant
to the competition.

35:50.440 --> 35:54.519
Nobody knows who he is or where
he's come from but he's fast.

35:54.520 --> 35:56.159
He's fast, all right.

35:56.160 --> 35:58.559
You're speaking about yourself
in the third person,

35:58.560 --> 36:00.559
that's the first sign of madness,
isn't it?

36:00.560 --> 36:02.079
Don't brake, Bob. Don't...

36:02.080 --> 36:04.600
Don't even think about it!
Go, go, go, go, go!

36:08.200 --> 36:09.959
Don't brake!

36:09.960 --> 36:12.120
Don't brake. Brake face!

36:14.440 --> 36:17.840
Oh, he's BLEEP his pants,
but that's OK!

36:19.360 --> 36:21.920
Oh, and home. Thank God.

36:23.280 --> 36:26.639
I don't care how fast that was,
it's the best lap I've ever watched.

36:26.640 --> 36:27.839
Oh, thank you.

36:27.840 --> 36:29.760
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

36:32.520 --> 36:36.519
You can see the lap board, Bob.
Yeah. Where would you like to be?

36:36.520 --> 36:38.959
Well, it was very sedate.

36:38.960 --> 36:41.999
I would... I would be so chuffed
if I was above

36:42.000 --> 36:45.200
Dara - Uh-duh! - O Briain.
LAUGHTER

36:46.680 --> 36:49.239
So, you're setting your sights quite
high there, Bob.

36:49.240 --> 36:51.679
I've got the result. Oh, dear.

36:51.680 --> 36:54.879
And I can tell you, Bob Mortimer...

36:54.880 --> 36:58.799
..you went round our track
in one minute...

36:58.800 --> 37:01.239
..40... Ooh, hey-yup!

37:01.240 --> 37:02.559
..eight...

37:02.560 --> 37:07.079
..point four, so, Bob...
You're in! Hey!

37:07.080 --> 37:09.999
..you're just under
Frankie Dettori.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.799
You've got to be pleased.
I'm very pleased.

37:12.800 --> 37:16.039
HE LAUGHS Who'd have thought.

37:16.040 --> 37:19.599
Ladies and gentlemen, Bob Mortimer!
Thank you.

37:19.600 --> 37:21.880
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

37:23.800 --> 37:27.599
Now, time to get back to Borneo
where, as you'll remember,

37:27.600 --> 37:30.079
the producers had arranged
for the British Army's Gurkha

37:30.080 --> 37:32.239
regiment to interrupt our journey.

37:32.240 --> 37:34.959
That's because the point of this
film had always been to work

37:34.960 --> 37:38.599
with the Gurkhas and have a massive
off-road adventure in the jungle,

37:38.600 --> 37:42.959
but the jungle the Army sends the
Gurkhas to train in is in Brunei,

37:42.960 --> 37:46.159
and the mystery car collector
we were on our way to see

37:46.160 --> 37:48.799
was none other than the Sultan of
Brunei who,

37:48.800 --> 37:51.159
it's fair to say,
wasn't expecting us.

37:51.160 --> 37:54.679
Now, after we landed back in the UK,
having made this film,

37:54.680 --> 37:57.679
the Sultan announced new laws
making homosexuality

37:57.680 --> 38:03.079
and adultery punishable by death. As
you can imagine, we were horrified.

38:03.080 --> 38:05.559
We'd obviously never have visited
Brunei

38:05.560 --> 38:07.639
had that been the case beforehand.

38:07.640 --> 38:10.239
And, though there's a temporary
halt on enforcing this law,

38:10.240 --> 38:13.079
we thought long and hard about
showing this film.

38:13.080 --> 38:15.279
But the Gurkhas were brilliant,
as were the men

38:15.280 --> 38:18.439
and women of Brunei who helped make
this journey possible,

38:18.440 --> 38:20.400
so part two is for them.

38:23.760 --> 38:25.799
Morning in Brunei.

38:25.800 --> 38:29.599
Overnight, our rare cars
had been taken off us

38:29.600 --> 38:31.360
and dropped deep into the jungle.

38:33.760 --> 38:36.999
Now, to prove them worthy
of the Sultan's collection once

38:37.000 --> 38:39.439
and for all, we'd each been
assigned a three-man

38:39.440 --> 38:42.039
squad of Gurkhas to help us
find them,

38:42.040 --> 38:45.560
bring them out alive and deliver
them to his palace.

38:48.360 --> 38:51.039
The heat's baking.

38:51.040 --> 38:54.279
We're travelling down the river
to God knows where.

38:54.280 --> 38:55.999
Safe to say...

38:56.000 --> 38:58.080
..I'm out of me comfort zone.

39:04.040 --> 39:07.319
I know for a fact, that in this
water, it's full of crocodiles.

39:07.320 --> 39:08.760
I'm hanging on.

39:14.360 --> 39:17.039
Is this it? Is this it?
I think we're here.

39:17.040 --> 39:19.240
We're turning round,
we're going somewhere.

39:20.800 --> 39:22.759
What's going on?

39:22.760 --> 39:25.320
We're getting off. Hang on.
What's going on?

39:27.160 --> 39:29.000
We're going.

39:32.480 --> 39:35.399
What the hell's going on?
Don't know, mate.

39:35.400 --> 39:39.719
Safely ashore, before we could begin
the hunt for our cars,

39:39.720 --> 39:43.120
our new colleagues wanted to give us
the lay of the land.

39:44.240 --> 39:47.679
Did you see this sign? Yeah.
Wild boar, that's a pretty big one.

39:47.680 --> 39:49.919
Dangerous? Very dangerous.

39:49.920 --> 39:52.279
If you see boar in the jungle,
avoid it.

39:52.280 --> 39:54.279
What do we do? Hide behind a tree?

39:54.280 --> 39:56.439
Yeah, run. Run? Yeah.

39:56.440 --> 40:00.279
You can see there, that's from the
crocodile, from the river crocodile.

40:00.280 --> 40:02.439
Crocodile? They're coming out
to here? Yeah.

40:02.440 --> 40:05.799
Could there be a nest round here?
A nest? Crocodile nest.

40:05.800 --> 40:09.399
They put their eggs in. Might be.
What else should we look for?

40:09.400 --> 40:11.359
There's boars, crocodiles.

40:11.360 --> 40:13.639
So be aware of very dry, dry trees.

40:13.640 --> 40:17.759
There could be spiders
and scorpions. Right.

40:17.760 --> 40:20.239
Basically, nothing is nice.

40:20.240 --> 40:21.640
PADDY SIGHS

40:23.720 --> 40:28.519
Even with the 2015 Australian I'm
A Celebrity champion for company,

40:28.520 --> 40:30.119
I was well out me depth.

40:30.120 --> 40:31.919
Oh! BLEEP!

40:31.920 --> 40:35.039
Oh. Oh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.

40:35.040 --> 40:38.359
You all right, Pad? Have to be
careful around here, hadn't you?

40:38.360 --> 40:40.800
Oop. Oh, look at that.

40:42.880 --> 40:44.319
Is that one of them

40:44.320 --> 40:47.119
knives that can cut through anything
that you see on QVC?

40:47.120 --> 40:50.559
Just told me be careful with them,
the spikes are poisonous.

40:50.560 --> 40:52.439
Yeah, it's not something

40:52.440 --> 40:55.679
I were going to go and
exactly try and touch.

40:55.680 --> 40:59.799
How do you think your car's going
to do in here, Paddy? Mine? Yeah.

40:59.800 --> 41:01.679
It's called the Bagheera, Fred.

41:01.680 --> 41:04.480
The panther, it were made
for this kind of stuff.

41:08.520 --> 41:09.839
Tell you what, Paddy,

41:09.840 --> 41:12.599
I can't wait to show you
what I've done to my car.

41:12.600 --> 41:15.280
What do you mean,
you've done to your car?

41:16.680 --> 41:19.359
Oh! Argh! Careful with that.

41:19.360 --> 41:22.039
Oh, God!

41:22.040 --> 41:24.520
Oh! It's a bit brutal, ain't it?

41:26.200 --> 41:27.919
Where have they put these cars?

41:27.920 --> 41:30.440
THUNDER RUMBLES

41:35.360 --> 41:39.840
What? Have you ever had
rain like that in your life? Oh!

41:42.440 --> 41:44.199
THUNDER RUMBLES

41:44.200 --> 41:47.240
It's actually chilly.
It is cold, ain't it? Chilly!

41:48.600 --> 41:52.920
After two hours hard trek,
we finally came across a clearing.

41:55.200 --> 41:58.919
Yes! The cars! Oh. The cars.

41:58.920 --> 42:02.119
I can't tell you how pleased I am
to see that Allegro.

42:02.120 --> 42:06.599
Look at her. Look at her. Hang on
a minute. What? What?

42:06.600 --> 42:09.439
That! Oh, the modifications.

42:09.440 --> 42:12.239
Yeah! Last night, I took it down
the shop with the lads.

42:12.240 --> 42:14.319
What do you mean the lads?
The Gurkhas.

42:14.320 --> 42:18.159
Did a few things to it to get it
through. We put bull bars on.

42:18.160 --> 42:22.799
Spare wheel. These are a must,
off-road tyres.

42:22.800 --> 42:27.119
Roof rack, spotlights, spare fuel,
spare tyres, you name it, Paddy,

42:27.120 --> 42:28.599
this car has now got it.

42:28.600 --> 42:30.519
This is just going to plough
through the jungle.

42:30.520 --> 42:32.399
I get what you've done,
but, to be honest,

42:32.400 --> 42:35.199
I think you've ruined it, pal.
He wants something untouched.

42:35.200 --> 42:37.359
But he wants one-offs.
He wants one-offs.

42:37.360 --> 42:39.639
This is now a one-off.
You've muddied it up too much,

42:39.640 --> 42:42.439
he's not going to want that.
Never mind concentrating on my car,

42:42.440 --> 42:45.559
how is that going to get
anywhere around here? Look at it.

42:45.560 --> 42:50.079
And, with that, Fred decided to show
what the Allegro could do.

42:50.080 --> 42:53.120
Come on. Come on, the Allegro.

42:54.160 --> 42:55.720
TYRES SKID

43:00.000 --> 43:02.319
Oh, it's not going to be easy, this.

43:02.320 --> 43:04.640
Are them the off-road tyres?

43:06.440 --> 43:08.199
Oh!

43:08.200 --> 43:09.840
Yes!

43:13.240 --> 43:16.040
ENGINES REVS, BANGING

43:18.960 --> 43:22.760
Oh, the modifications
have paid off, Fred!

43:23.920 --> 43:27.559
Eventually, though, with almost
no help from the Gurkhas...

43:27.560 --> 43:29.160
Go, go.

43:30.760 --> 43:34.039
..we started to make tracks.

43:34.040 --> 43:35.760
Yes, go on!

43:45.760 --> 43:48.640
We'll have to do some clearing,
lads. Yeah.

43:50.880 --> 43:53.480
That's it. Over here. Ready?

43:56.400 --> 43:58.320
Oh, I like this, teamwork.

44:03.960 --> 44:07.639
I seen all that when we got up,
I thought, "We've had it," but no.

44:07.640 --> 44:10.479
Not with these lads.
All hands on log. That's it!

44:10.480 --> 44:12.359
We're on it. You have to move
your Bagheera.

44:12.360 --> 44:15.079
Go move your Bagheera, Paddy.
Bagheera? It's yours in the way.

44:15.080 --> 44:17.160
No, but I can't move it for yours.

44:22.520 --> 44:24.280
How's that?

44:25.480 --> 44:27.719
BANG What are you doing?!

44:27.720 --> 44:30.519
Sorry, Paddy. You've gone into me
pop-ups.

44:30.520 --> 44:32.399
Why would you do that?!
It's a one-off!

44:32.400 --> 44:34.600
I can't get any spares for it!

44:35.600 --> 44:37.719
Clearing the tree,
we'd found our way

44:37.720 --> 44:40.359
onto one of the long-abandoned
logging tracks

44:40.360 --> 44:42.039
that intersects the jungle.

44:42.040 --> 44:46.400
A track that, with a bit of luck,
might just lead to a road.

44:47.680 --> 44:48.999
Come on. Yes.

44:49.000 --> 44:50.320
Come on.

44:54.560 --> 44:56.920
But luck wasn't on our side.

44:59.120 --> 45:02.079
Oh, my word. Can't see the path.

45:02.080 --> 45:03.879
Where are we going?

45:03.880 --> 45:06.439
Oh! Oh, no, we're stopping again.
Yeah.

45:06.440 --> 45:09.400
Not more. Every two minutes
there's something.

45:10.800 --> 45:12.999
Not again. Just gets thicker.

45:13.000 --> 45:15.799
Come on. Mate, we'll get through
that, just a bit of hacking.

45:15.800 --> 45:18.719
If we've got through that, we can
get through this. Hang on a minute.

45:18.720 --> 45:20.719
Are you saying we're driving
through that?

45:20.720 --> 45:22.599
Yeah, we're going to do a bit of
clearing,

45:22.600 --> 45:25.039
move all this stuff out
the way and let's get through.

45:25.040 --> 45:27.359
What? I've got my off-road tyres
jacked up, I'm fine.

45:27.360 --> 45:29.399
Yeah, I haven't. I'm two inches
off the ground.

45:29.400 --> 45:31.479
What was you saying before?
"Oh, the Bagheera.

45:31.480 --> 45:34.399
"Even the name's designed for the
jungle." Now you're backing out.

45:34.400 --> 45:38.399
Arjun? Yeah. Is there not another
way? Can we not get off this road?

45:38.400 --> 45:40.919
Is there another way out?
Paddy. Paddy. We're in the jungle,

45:40.920 --> 45:42.639
you're meant to get
through the jungle.

45:42.640 --> 45:46.599
Excuse me, I'm having a talk to me
captain. I'm going to get cracking.

45:46.600 --> 45:48.279
Get your pickaxe out,
you'll love that.

45:48.280 --> 45:52.079
Where are we? Where are we now?
So, here. We're here. I think...

45:52.080 --> 45:53.639
There's the one option, the river.

45:53.640 --> 45:56.079
Didn't have you down there
for a chicken, Pad. River?

45:56.080 --> 45:58.919
FREDDIE CLUCKS
There's no road. There's no road.

45:58.920 --> 46:01.719
If we can just get through a little
bit, we can get to that river.

46:01.720 --> 46:05.359
That's not far. Paddy. What?
Have you had the Gurkhas' motto?

46:05.360 --> 46:08.199
What's that? It's better to die
than be a coward.

46:08.200 --> 46:09.599
Look...
CLUCKING

46:09.600 --> 46:12.839
Chicken? We're still getting there,
it's not about being a chicken.

46:12.840 --> 46:16.079
This is, this is... Oh, this is...
This is what you're dealing with.

46:16.080 --> 46:20.119
What we've got here is a race,
sunshine.

46:20.120 --> 46:22.119
Paddy. Ignore him. Paddy,

46:22.120 --> 46:24.279
take your Bagheera...
Hang on a minute.

46:24.280 --> 46:26.480
HORN BLARES

46:29.200 --> 46:31.719
So, Team Bagheera had a new plan.

46:31.720 --> 46:35.440
If we'd come in by river,
we could escape that way, too.

46:36.480 --> 46:39.879
Captain Arjun had spotted an old
fishing settlement nearby.

46:39.880 --> 46:42.839
On foot, it was just a short hack
through the jungle.

46:42.840 --> 46:45.599
So, sending a scout on ahead
to look for anything that

46:45.600 --> 46:48.799
could help us float,
we saddled up...

46:48.800 --> 46:52.120
..and fired the Bagheera
back down the logging track.

46:53.440 --> 46:56.079
We're off. We're off.

46:56.080 --> 46:59.000
Lads, let's pick up the pace now,
we've got to beat Paddy.

47:01.680 --> 47:04.759
Oh! Oh, oh, oh! Whoa! Wahey! Oh!

47:04.760 --> 47:09.159
Yes! It's like a railway car. Yeah!
The Bagheera...

47:09.160 --> 47:11.399
..in its natural habitat.

47:11.400 --> 47:12.999
It's impressive!

47:13.000 --> 47:15.799
Oh, gets a bit rocky here. Oh!

47:15.800 --> 47:18.959
Oh! Oh! That's savage.

47:18.960 --> 47:20.120
Oh!

47:21.360 --> 47:23.039
What the hell?!

47:23.040 --> 47:26.800
Oh! He'll still be hacking his way
through the jungle.

47:29.520 --> 47:31.759
For now, though, I need my machete.

47:31.760 --> 47:35.000
Words I'd never thought I say, that.
"I need my machete."

47:43.480 --> 47:45.400
Come on, lads, we've got to beat
Paddy now.

47:47.880 --> 47:49.679
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

47:49.680 --> 47:51.519
Whoa!

47:51.520 --> 47:56.280
It is doing the business now, boys!
I like this car! Yeah!

47:57.800 --> 47:59.599
We are on it now!

47:59.600 --> 48:00.839
Whoa!

48:00.840 --> 48:03.719
Wow! Oh!

48:03.720 --> 48:08.119
But it's sideways, though.
Look at this!

48:08.120 --> 48:10.479
While Paddy McCrae
was on the charge,

48:10.480 --> 48:14.839
I was doing whatever I could
to keep the Allegro moving.

48:14.840 --> 48:16.520
Heave!

48:17.600 --> 48:18.999
Come on, we can do it!

48:19.000 --> 48:21.919
Argh! Heave! Push!

48:21.920 --> 48:24.599
Yes! Yeah! Come on!

48:24.600 --> 48:28.600
Right, stop it. Stop, stop, stop,
stop! Oh!

48:30.320 --> 48:32.319
Feel like a Shire horse.

48:32.320 --> 48:37.319
A couple of miles east, meanwhile,
Team Bagheera had reached the river.

48:37.320 --> 48:38.480
Right.

48:39.880 --> 48:43.040
That's not the raft, is it?
Oh, this is... We can make better.

48:44.200 --> 48:47.720
We're going to have to make it a lot
better. There's no middle to it.

48:49.760 --> 48:52.639
I hate to say it, lads, but we're in
a rush here.

48:52.640 --> 48:55.759
Push! Keep going! Keep going!

48:55.760 --> 48:58.079
Yeah!

48:58.080 --> 49:00.559
Always bend at the knees, Arjun.

49:00.560 --> 49:02.919
Bend at the knees not the back.

49:02.920 --> 49:07.759
VOICEOVER: Down at the water, the
plan was simple - bulk up the raft,

49:07.760 --> 49:09.479
build a slipway...

49:09.480 --> 49:12.319
Have you got it? Try, Paddy? Yeah.

49:12.320 --> 49:14.159
VOICEOVER: and don't sink
the Bagheera.

49:14.160 --> 49:16.560
Right. I'm going to bring her down.

49:19.280 --> 49:21.519
Here we go. This side. Yep.

49:21.520 --> 49:24.279
A little bit still. Still. Still.

49:24.280 --> 49:26.400
OK!

49:27.800 --> 49:29.520
Doesn't help with the bloody rain.

49:30.680 --> 49:32.520
OK. Little bit. Yeah.

49:41.160 --> 49:44.320
Yeah? Yes. That's good.

49:49.040 --> 49:51.519
OK. Come in, come in.

49:51.520 --> 49:53.799
Good. We're on, boys!

49:53.800 --> 49:57.279
Good. We're on! We're on.

49:57.280 --> 49:58.839
He's left me.

49:58.840 --> 50:00.640
Give him... Nothing.

50:02.760 --> 50:04.360
Oh, my word.

50:06.040 --> 50:09.560
It's not the easiest path...
but it's the most rewarding.

50:11.480 --> 50:15.199
Look at this. We're moving,
we're moving! We're only moving!

50:15.200 --> 50:17.079
This car just amazes me.

50:17.080 --> 50:20.319
And it might just have found
a way out.

50:20.320 --> 50:23.599
Oh-ho-ho-ho! Come on, we're back!

50:23.600 --> 50:27.239
Come on, come on. Get in, lads.

50:27.240 --> 50:29.439
Out on the raft, meanwhile,

50:29.440 --> 50:32.559
Operation River Rapids
was under way.

50:32.560 --> 50:36.599
Although, to be fair,
not quite as rapidly as we'd hoped.

50:36.600 --> 50:40.040
So, to keep up morale,
I broke out the refreshments.

50:41.480 --> 50:43.799
Time to get out the big guns.

50:43.800 --> 50:46.159
I've got the Angel Delight.

50:46.160 --> 50:48.120
Oh, thanks. Have a cup.

50:49.240 --> 50:52.039
On the top, there. On the top.
That's it.

50:52.040 --> 50:53.640
Yeah, that's open.

50:55.600 --> 50:57.799
Oh!

50:57.800 --> 51:01.119
Strawberry. It's the only flavour
to have.

51:01.120 --> 51:02.440
Little bit of milk.

51:03.680 --> 51:06.880
Give it a stir. That's it.

51:12.400 --> 51:15.399
Here we go. We're rallying now.
We're rallying.

51:15.400 --> 51:19.119
This is going pretty smooth. Smooth.
It's the car, it's the car.

51:19.120 --> 51:21.759
I'm glad you noticed. Suspension.

51:21.760 --> 51:24.440
Hydro gas. It's an absolute dream.

51:25.520 --> 51:27.359
Oh, my word.

51:27.360 --> 51:28.840
Oh!

51:30.600 --> 51:32.800
Bloomin' heck!

51:35.040 --> 51:37.599
It's a taste of home. Yeah.

51:37.600 --> 51:42.000
Look at us. Four Gurkhas
eating Angel Delight.

51:44.640 --> 51:47.320
Arjun, I've got to ask,
have you ever met Joanna Lumley?

51:49.520 --> 51:53.599
With the Bagheera gradually
floating out of the running,

51:53.600 --> 51:57.039
Team Allegro was out of the weather
and on the charge.

51:57.040 --> 51:58.599
Oh, my word.

51:58.600 --> 52:01.559
Is that... Is that...? It's not.
Tarmac!

52:01.560 --> 52:06.080
Come on!
THEY CHEER

52:09.000 --> 52:12.439
Whoa. Bit of land there, boys.
I think we can get in there.

52:12.440 --> 52:16.119
Paddling. Keep paddling, yeah.
That's it, round we go.

52:16.120 --> 52:19.080
Now, look at that
for a handbrake turn.

52:21.160 --> 52:23.279
Push. Whoa! Jesus!

52:23.280 --> 52:25.359
Yeah.

52:25.360 --> 52:28.359
Time is of the essence.

52:28.360 --> 52:32.240
Out the way, boys. I'm on, lads!

52:37.800 --> 52:42.479
Come on, Bagheera! Yes! Yes,
Bagheera! Yeah!

52:42.480 --> 52:44.800
We're on, boys!

52:47.560 --> 52:50.039
This was it. The edge of the jungle.

52:50.040 --> 52:51.239
We'd each found a road

52:51.240 --> 52:55.119
and it would now be a race 40 miles
north-east to the Brunei capital,

52:55.120 --> 52:59.520
Bandar Seri Begawan,
and the Sultan's palace.

53:00.560 --> 53:03.679
But, while Flintoff had escaped onto
decent roads and was making

53:03.680 --> 53:07.880
good time, the river had spat me
out closer to the finish.

53:09.800 --> 53:13.479
The Bagheera was well
back in the fight.

53:13.480 --> 53:15.559
Come on!

53:15.560 --> 53:18.760
Next stop, the Sultan
of Brunei's palace!

53:20.280 --> 53:23.079
I have got to win this!

53:23.080 --> 53:27.559
Oh, it's singing. 69 horsepower.

53:27.560 --> 53:29.759
And they're all charging right now.

53:29.760 --> 53:32.159
It's got to beat Paddy.

53:32.160 --> 53:34.519
No way we can be beaten by Paddy.

53:34.520 --> 53:37.079
This is going to fly to the palace.

53:37.080 --> 53:38.959
I've got this covered!

53:38.960 --> 53:41.400
Oh!

53:46.160 --> 53:47.799
It's horrendous.

53:47.800 --> 53:50.559
Oh, that is deep. That is deep.

53:50.560 --> 53:53.439
Urgh! Oh!

53:53.440 --> 53:55.280
Not felt stress like it.

53:57.560 --> 53:59.199
Oh, God.

53:59.200 --> 54:02.319
When does this road get any better?!

54:02.320 --> 54:05.559
Which way? Turn left, please. Where?
Left. Left.

54:05.560 --> 54:07.199
Hey, is... It's the highway now.

54:07.200 --> 54:09.519
Is this the motorway? Yeah.
Oh, here we come.

54:09.520 --> 54:12.039
We're getting on the highway.
Now we're talking.

54:12.040 --> 54:15.919
Look at us, this is the fastest
I've been in it so far. Yeah.

54:15.920 --> 54:18.799
But there's no way that Paddy going
through the way he's gone

54:18.800 --> 54:21.959
can be going this fast.
Come on, the Allegro!

54:21.960 --> 54:25.639
Tarmac. Yes, yes, yes, yes!

54:25.640 --> 54:27.999
Let's go!

54:28.000 --> 54:31.919
Now we're talking.
Let's open the taps. Come on!

54:31.920 --> 54:34.120
We are motoring!

54:35.480 --> 54:37.320
This road is fantastic!

54:38.360 --> 54:42.119
And my odds were about to
improve even more.

54:42.120 --> 54:44.599
RATTLING

54:44.600 --> 54:47.640
Can you hear that rattle from the
engine now, can't you? What's that?

54:51.160 --> 54:52.760
It's starting to get hot.

54:55.280 --> 54:57.359
Oh, there's a bit of smoke.

54:57.360 --> 55:01.319
Smoke? Yeah. Are we getting smoke?

55:01.320 --> 55:04.119
Oh, no. We're dying.

55:04.120 --> 55:06.279
I'm losing power.

55:06.280 --> 55:08.440
Oh, no, no, no, no.

55:10.400 --> 55:14.639
Smell that? Oh, yeah. Geez!
What is wrong, Freddie?

55:14.640 --> 55:17.839
Just getting hot, mate.
Just overheating.

55:17.840 --> 55:19.759
Just time, though, isn't it? Yeah.

55:19.760 --> 55:21.880
And we've got no idea
where Paddy is.

55:26.680 --> 55:29.559
What I'm looking for
is a really massive bridge.

55:29.560 --> 55:32.960
The Gurkhas said, once you're at
that, you know you're in Bandar.

55:35.320 --> 55:38.159
Got to get to the Bandar Bridge.

55:38.160 --> 55:42.319
Do you know what? I reckon,
we've got the radiator here,

55:42.320 --> 55:45.679
this is blocking it.
The number plate.

55:45.680 --> 55:49.080
We flatten it, might get more
air in. Yeah. Do you reckon?

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
Push it down.

55:58.120 --> 56:01.439
There's bits hanging off,
lost my rear view mirror,

56:01.440 --> 56:03.799
lost me air vents.
GEARS GRIND

56:03.800 --> 56:05.400
Oh, God, come on, gears.

56:06.400 --> 56:09.199
Front bumper's fallen off.
I forgot about that.

56:09.200 --> 56:11.440
Me Matra sign's fallen
off the back.

56:12.360 --> 56:14.359
God, come on.

56:14.360 --> 56:16.480
I haven't even seen any signs yet.

56:18.600 --> 56:20.959
That's it, crack on, the Allegro.

56:20.960 --> 56:23.239
The suspension
on the front left's gone.

56:23.240 --> 56:26.439
The foot well down there, where my
feet are, is boiling hot.

56:26.440 --> 56:30.239
But it's still moving.
It's still chugging on.

56:30.240 --> 56:34.080
I just don't know
for how much longer.

56:38.920 --> 56:41.359
If I'm not mistaken...

56:41.360 --> 56:44.120
..THIS IS A BIG BRIDGE!

56:48.680 --> 56:53.080
I'm in Bandar! In the Bagheera!

56:58.640 --> 57:01.239
Surely be, we're getting closer now,
look.

57:01.240 --> 57:03.439
We're off the motorway,
we're going through the city,

57:03.440 --> 57:07.399
I can see the signs. Take a left,
yeah. Bandar Seri Begawan.

57:07.400 --> 57:09.359
Bandar Seri Begawan.

57:09.360 --> 57:11.479
We're getting closer.

57:11.480 --> 57:13.199
Come on!

57:13.200 --> 57:14.439
GEARS LURCH

57:14.440 --> 57:20.159
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Not now.
Not now, not here. Oh, God.

57:20.160 --> 57:22.080
The lights have turned red.

57:23.040 --> 57:25.520
GEARS SCREECH

57:28.160 --> 57:31.320

Sorry! Coming over.

57:32.520 --> 57:36.359
Oh! Is that it? Yes, thank you.

57:36.360 --> 57:38.439
Oh, God, has it jumped out again?

57:38.440 --> 57:39.640
HORNS HONK

57:43.640 --> 57:47.760
Going to have to try a hard start
in second. Sorry!

57:49.120 --> 57:50.960
Oh!

57:52.960 --> 57:54.439
FREDDIE GROANS

57:54.440 --> 57:57.600
Just find one, big, last push.
Please, please, please.

57:59.320 --> 58:01.360
Where is it?

58:02.400 --> 58:05.240
I mean, it's a palace,
how can I miss a palace?

58:07.040 --> 58:09.079
How close? How close?

58:09.080 --> 58:11.560
Somewhere around here.
What, we're close to the palace?

58:15.080 --> 58:16.320
Come on!

58:17.840 --> 58:20.239
Let's do it
for the Gurkhas, Bagheera.

58:20.240 --> 58:21.560
Come on!

58:22.720 --> 58:25.679
There's traffic around now.
Come on, move!

58:25.680 --> 58:29.279
GEARS SCREECH
Whoa! That's not sounding good.

58:29.280 --> 58:30.959
Do I change to fourth? Do I risk it?

58:30.960 --> 58:32.440
Oh, I risked it! He's done it!

58:34.040 --> 58:37.360
Come on. Come on, Palace.

58:38.600 --> 58:41.119
Left. Left. Oh, you are kidding me.

58:41.120 --> 58:45.239
You are absolutely kidding me.

58:45.240 --> 58:47.159
HE LAUGHS

58:47.160 --> 58:49.599
Aye, Paddy. Hey?

58:49.600 --> 58:53.079
Yous no way you've gone through
the jungle. No way.

58:53.080 --> 58:54.600
Ask the lads, ask the Gurkhas.

58:55.920 --> 58:59.359
How's that got here before that?

58:59.360 --> 59:00.999
Oh. Oh.

59:01.000 --> 59:03.719
See, soon as you get here with that,
this happens.

59:03.720 --> 59:06.400
Is he in? We've, erm...

59:07.880 --> 59:10.119
I've bought it for the Sultan.

59:10.120 --> 59:12.319
No, no, no, don't bring it here.

59:12.320 --> 59:15.119
Shall I leave the keys with you?
No, no, no, no.

59:15.120 --> 59:17.759
Shall I leave them in the ignition?
You can't park there.

59:17.760 --> 59:19.199
I'll leave them in here.

59:19.200 --> 59:21.439
Park over there. He's saying go.

59:21.440 --> 59:24.679
Get in the car. Get in the car.

59:24.680 --> 59:27.279
Unbelievable, boys. Thank you so
much. Thank you.

59:27.280 --> 59:29.399
Had a good time with you. Thank you.
Boys.

59:29.400 --> 59:32.399
It's been a pleasure.
Been a pleasure, lads.

59:32.400 --> 59:36.320
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
Well done. Well done.

59:38.440 --> 59:41.719
Impressive cars, them. Impressive.

59:41.720 --> 59:45.399
I am absolutely staggered
they survived.

59:45.400 --> 59:48.279
What we've learned is, if you want
to cross a jungle,

59:48.280 --> 59:52.159
you don't need a 4x4, what you need
is a knackered, old car

59:52.160 --> 59:55.439
and a highly trained team of
Gurkhas? They were good lads.

59:55.440 --> 59:58.439
They were great lads, weren't they?
Good lads. Unbelievable.

59:58.440 --> 01:00:00.839
Very good lads. But the cars, I
mean, the Bagheera,

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:02.919
how on Earth did it survive?
It was amazing!

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:05.759
Everything that we've thrown at
that car, it just carried on going.

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:08.399
And the Allegro, you know, the most
unreliable car in history,

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:10.239
you found the only reliable one
ever made.

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:12.799
I got to like it more and more
as the journey went on.

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:15.679
That was British Leyland
at its finest. Well, Chris,

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:20.239
now it's down to you to choose
which is the best of our rare cars.

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:24.559
It's like choosing between two
really ugly children.
LAUGHTER

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:27.639
Ooh! Erm... I can't... Look,

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:29.359
I have to give it... Yeah.

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:30.799
..to the Allegro.

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:34.879
What?! Yes! I didn't see that
coming! Get in! Get in, Paddy!

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:39.119
Oh! Yes! The Allegro!

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:43.159
It's all right, Paddy.
He had off-road tyres on it!

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:46.639
You did well. OK, look, you're
double denim and you're angry.

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:48.039
Shocked. You're angry.

01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:50.479
But the fact is the Allegro's
an object of hate

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.879
and it succeeded
at something in its life.

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:56.039
I've got to say, I fell in love
with the Allegro myself.

01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:57.959
Me too and the Bagheera
just kept going.

01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:00.279
You never thought it would get
through that terrain,

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:03.279
how low it was at the start. Yep.
Both did well.

01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:04.919
LAUGHTER

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:07.239
I presume you've left them
in the jungle, right? No,

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:10.239
we were never going to leave them
for the Sultan, were we? No.

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:11.519
Not a chance.

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:14.799
So, instead, we shipped our rare
car heroes back home

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:17.839
and we've given them a lick of paint
just to freshen them up.

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:20.759
Bring them in, lads. In they come.
In they come.

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:23.519
I love this car. I love this car.

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:25.559
Come on!

01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:29.320
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE DROWN SPEECH

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:35.080
Yeah!

01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:37.640
I love this car.

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:42.599
Beautiful. That's all for tonight.

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:45.639
We'll see you next week.
Thanks for watching. Goodnight.

01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:47.400
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
