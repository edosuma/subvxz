00:10.720 --> 00:12.460
Crichton:
Are you with me there,
Mama Bear?

00:12.555 --> 00:15.718
D.K.:
Oh, yeah, Farscape.
I'm reading you loud and clear.

00:15.808 --> 00:20.802
Crichton:
Authorizing flight computer
to initiate acceleration sequencing...

00:20.897 --> 00:22.182
now.

00:22.273 --> 00:25.356
Roger, Farscape. You are go
for insertion procedure.

00:28.029 --> 00:29.565
Farscape One, hold a moment.

00:29.655 --> 00:31.361
Hold? Canaveral, what?!

00:31.449 --> 00:34.566
Meteorology reports some kind
of electromagnetic wave.

00:34.660 --> 00:37.117
Repeat, some kind of wave.
John, do you read me?

00:37.205 --> 00:39.196
(garbled reply)

00:40.208 --> 00:42.039
Son, you have to abort!

00:42.126 --> 00:43.957
Abort, now!

00:53.012 --> 00:55.469
Jack:
I only know what the
doctor told me.

00:56.974 --> 00:58.350
What the hell?

00:58.434 --> 01:01.426
I think he's going to come
out of it on his own.

01:03.272 --> 01:04.978
All right.

01:05.066 --> 01:06.806
I'll call you if there
are any changes.

01:07.235 --> 01:09.317
Good-bye.

01:09.403 --> 01:10.779
(sighs)

01:12.281 --> 01:13.521
John?

01:14.617 --> 01:17.734
That's my name.
Don't wear it out.

01:17.828 --> 01:20.319
Nurse, calla doctor.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.871
Hey, how you feeling?

01:22.959 --> 01:24.165
Ah, hot.

01:24.252 --> 01:28.336
Dizzy. Kind of... feel like
I've been hit by a house.

01:30.341 --> 01:32.297
You're going to be okay, son.

01:33.302 --> 01:35.258
You gave us all quite a scare.

01:35.346 --> 01:37.177
I told 'em you were a survivor.

01:37.265 --> 01:39.756
Yeah, I am that.

01:39.850 --> 01:41.556
It's good to have
you back, son.

01:41.644 --> 01:43.259
What are you doing?!

01:43.354 --> 01:45.390
Son!
-|'m not your son!

01:45.481 --> 01:46.812
Get him off of me!

01:46.899 --> 01:50.391
You're a fake!
Get your hands off me!

01:51.988 --> 01:54.855
Get your hands off of me!

01:54.949 --> 01:56.064
(gasps loudly)

01:56.158 --> 01:59.286
Let go! Don't touch me!

02:01.289 --> 02:02.950
Aeryn! Aeryn!

02:03.040 --> 02:05.417
Right, we'll need full
restraints. And can you get me
a clean |.V., please?

02:05.501 --> 02:07.002
Jeez, get 'em off!

02:07.086 --> 02:08.792
Get 'em off me! Get the...

02:11.090 --> 02:14.332
It's not real. It's not real.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.800
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

02:20.891 --> 02:24.304
A radiation wave hit and I got
shot through a wormhole.

02:24.395 --> 02:27.057
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe on a ship,

02:27.148 --> 02:30.481
a living ship, full of strange
alien life-forms.

02:30.568 --> 02:31.318
Help me.

02:31.402 --> 02:32.858
Listen, please.

02:32.945 --> 02:34.810
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

02:34.905 --> 02:39.148
I'm being hunted by an insane
military commander.

02:39.243 --> 02:41.359
I'm doing everything I can.

02:41.454 --> 02:44.287
I'm just looking for
a way home.

03:07.605 --> 03:11.439
Aeryn, honey, could you get me
out of these straps?

03:11.525 --> 03:14.232
What happened? The last thing
I remember, l was on a
Commerce Planet.

03:14.320 --> 03:18.313
Mr. Crichton, my name is Dr.
Bettina Fairchild, not Aeryn.

03:18.407 --> 03:20.489
Bettina...

03:20.576 --> 03:22.237
Cool name.

03:24.163 --> 03:26.199
Still disoriented?

03:27.792 --> 03:30.249
You have no brain damage,
as far as we can tell.

03:30.336 --> 03:33.169
You do have a fever.
Probably a low-grade infection,

03:33.255 --> 03:36.122
but some antibiotics should
clear that up.
Might clear your head as well.

03:36.217 --> 03:39.209
(whispering ):
Hey, are they listening to us?
Is that why you can't talk?

03:39.303 --> 03:42.215
Violent and now paranoid.

03:42.306 --> 03:45.264
Perhaps another CAT scan
would be indicated.

03:46.644 --> 03:47.850
Sorry.

03:47.937 --> 03:51.350
I, uh, fuzzed out there
for a minute.

03:52.858 --> 03:54.849
What day is it today?

03:56.695 --> 03:58.105
Today's Monday.

03:58.197 --> 04:00.813
Monday.
-lt's been a week since
you crashed.

04:00.908 --> 04:05.072
l crashed? I don't
remember crashing.

04:05.162 --> 04:10.327
But I did have this,
this terrible nightmare.

04:10.418 --> 04:12.579
l was on a ship full of aliens.

04:14.880 --> 04:18.498
Is that why you went after
your father and bruised
two of his ribs?

04:18.592 --> 04:20.628
Yeah.

04:20.719 --> 04:26.635
He looked like he was human,
but he had alien goo on the
inside that was...

04:26.725 --> 04:28.226
pretty freaky, huh?

04:28.310 --> 04:30.687
But now you know better.

04:31.522 --> 04:33.058
Yeah.

04:33.149 --> 04:34.980
Yeah, I'm all clear.

04:36.777 --> 04:41.237
Look, I'm not going to hurt
anybody. You can let me
out of these straps.

04:41.323 --> 04:43.780
You called me Aeryn.

04:44.535 --> 04:46.116
Old girlfriend.

04:46.203 --> 04:48.615
You look a lot like her.

04:49.415 --> 04:51.246
Except you have prettier hair.

04:52.168 --> 04:53.408
Mmm.

04:55.212 --> 04:56.622
Is my Dad around?

04:57.798 --> 05:00.039
Out in the lounge, I think.

05:00.843 --> 05:02.754
I'd like to say I'm sorry.

05:02.845 --> 05:04.801
Probably best you do
that yourself.

05:04.889 --> 05:06.299
Thank you.

05:06.390 --> 05:10.008
Do you good to move the muscles.
Thank you, Mr. Crichton.

05:10.102 --> 05:15.267
Announcement:
Will the owner of a green van
parked outside admissions please move it immediately?

05:15.357 --> 05:17.018
You will be towed.

05:17.109 --> 05:18.144
( whistles )

05:18.235 --> 05:20.317
Won't get fooled again.

05:20.404 --> 05:22.440
Hey, you mind?

05:22.531 --> 05:24.487
Sorry. I thought it was co-ed.

05:24.575 --> 05:26.691
Co-ed? What planet are you from?

05:26.785 --> 05:28.400
Not this one.

05:30.080 --> 05:32.822
Hey, yo, yo, dude, are you
done with that paper?

05:32.917 --> 05:33.997
Yeah, sure. Here you go.

05:34.084 --> 05:36.166
Thank you.
-No problem.

05:36.253 --> 05:38.289
"Gator victim number six."

05:38.380 --> 05:42.168
Last week it was five. They're
getting the details right.

05:44.428 --> 05:45.793
Hey.

05:45.888 --> 05:47.674
Hey, how you doing?

05:47.765 --> 05:49.972
Well, I'm better. I'm much,
much better.

05:50.059 --> 05:53.597
Look, I am sorry about earlier.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.894
You don't need to
apologize, son.

05:55.981 --> 05:57.266
You've been through a lot.

05:57.358 --> 05:59.724
I lost it myself when
your mother died.

05:59.818 --> 06:02.309
Mom...
-Papa Bear!

06:03.030 --> 06:06.272
Whoa, ho, D.K.l

06:06.367 --> 06:08.403
Hey, hey, hey, you made
it this time.

06:08.494 --> 06:09.859
Glad you're up and about, man.

06:09.954 --> 06:12.787
Sick of getting reamed
on my own.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.909
Oh, getting reamed, are we?

06:15.000 --> 06:16.706
IASA's got a blown mission.

06:16.794 --> 06:20.912
They're tossing around words
like "pilot error".

06:21.006 --> 06:24.214
There was no pilot error.
It was Meteorology's screw up.

06:24.301 --> 06:26.713
They didn't give enough
warning about that
electromagnetic wave.

06:26.804 --> 06:28.920
He was told to abort
a dozen times.

06:29.014 --> 06:30.003
He did abort.

06:30.099 --> 06:31.589
Yeah, not soon enough.
He blacked out.

06:31.684 --> 06:33.470
And he still managed to
land the module.

06:33.561 --> 06:35.677
He trashed the sucker.

06:35.771 --> 06:39.059
The Farscape project's
circling the drain.

06:39.149 --> 06:41.185
Okay, what do you want
me to do?

06:41.277 --> 06:42.642
Pull it together.

06:42.736 --> 06:45.478
First thing you need's a
clean bill of health.

06:45.573 --> 06:48.110
Dr. Fairchild says you're
okay physically.

06:48.200 --> 06:51.283
She's not going to kick
you loose without a
full psych report.

06:51.370 --> 06:52.610
Doc Betty said that?

06:52.705 --> 06:54.616
That's right.
You gotta get shrunk.

06:54.707 --> 06:57.949
She wants you to see
a Dr. Kaminsky.

06:58.043 --> 07:00.534
Crichton:
"Dr. Jean Kaminsky."

07:01.463 --> 07:02.452
(sighs)

07:02.548 --> 07:04.630
Man, hot in here.

07:11.307 --> 07:15.471
Hello. Yeah, hey, I'd like
to order a pizza.

07:17.479 --> 07:21.222
Um, medium. Deluxe.

07:21.317 --> 07:22.853
Man, these guys are good.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.854
Thank you, Charles.

07:25.487 --> 07:27.148
( phone beeps)

07:29.700 --> 07:32.191
Sorry to keep you.

07:33.245 --> 07:34.405
Zhaan.

07:35.289 --> 07:38.281
Zan? Adjective or name?

07:41.253 --> 07:43.244
It's a name.

07:43.339 --> 07:45.751
Then I'm afraid you're mistaken.

07:45.841 --> 07:47.126
l'm Dr. Kaminsky.

07:47.217 --> 07:51.506
Uh-huh. And you are
a psychiatrist?

07:51.972 --> 07:52.757
Mm-hmm.

07:52.848 --> 07:54.088
ldon't think so.

07:54.183 --> 07:57.846
On Earth, psychiatrists
don't come in blue.

07:57.936 --> 08:00.643
Do you have a problem
with people of color?

08:00.731 --> 08:02.972
l have a contextual problem.

08:03.067 --> 08:04.352
You're an alien.

08:04.443 --> 08:06.900
Yes, that's true, but I do
have a green card.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.023
Interesting.

08:09.114 --> 08:12.151
Are you or are you not blue?

08:12.242 --> 08:14.028
Would it matter to
you if I was?

08:14.119 --> 08:16.781
Do you always answer a question
with a question?

08:16.872 --> 08:18.112
Does that bother you?

08:18.207 --> 08:19.617
Stop it.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.953
Facts.

08:22.044 --> 08:24.330
You're a Delvian. A plant.

08:24.421 --> 08:28.164
Tenth level Pa'u.
We shared Unity once.

08:28.258 --> 08:30.340
"Shared unity."

08:30.427 --> 08:32.258
Interesting euphemism.

08:32.346 --> 08:35.213
No, Mr. Crichton, you and
I have never had sex.

08:35.307 --> 08:38.265
I'm sure I'd remember
if we had.

08:41.438 --> 08:43.224
Put your hands on my face.

08:44.108 --> 08:46.394
Humor me. Just...

08:47.152 --> 08:48.733
here.

08:55.244 --> 08:56.950
Damn.

08:58.372 --> 09:00.158
What were you expecting?

09:00.249 --> 09:02.615
Expecting?

09:03.293 --> 09:04.999
Nothing.

09:05.087 --> 09:07.874
Hoping for an ally.

09:07.965 --> 09:10.001
You feel you don't
have any allies?

09:10.092 --> 09:11.298
Not in this joint, no.

09:11.385 --> 09:13.341
My enemies haven't revealed
themselves yet.

09:13.429 --> 09:15.260
And who are they?

09:15.347 --> 09:16.632
The Ancients?

09:16.724 --> 09:18.806
Nah, they picked my
brain already.

09:18.892 --> 09:23.386
Maldis? Uh-uh, not his style.
Not gothic enough.

09:25.399 --> 09:29.517
Delvians. Mmm.
Yeah, Occam's razor.

09:29.611 --> 09:32.853
Tahleen and her wacky bunch.

09:32.948 --> 09:35.234
Come out, come out,
wherever you are,

09:35.325 --> 09:39.193
and see the young man who
fell from the star!

09:39.288 --> 09:41.279
Kim, cancel my 3:00
appointment.

09:41.373 --> 09:43.785
In fact, cancel the
rest of my day.

09:46.044 --> 09:48.581
Hey, what'd you tell her?

09:48.672 --> 09:52.915
Oh, trauma, stress, crash. You
know, made me imagine things.

09:53.010 --> 09:56.002
Everything she wanted to hear
but hey, I'm all better now.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.711
So you got a clean psych
report. Great.

09:57.806 --> 10:00.343
( screeching )
Yeah, go figure that.

10:00.434 --> 10:03.301
She let me loose. I would have
locked me up in a padded cell.

10:08.567 --> 10:10.432
(driver yells)

10:22.372 --> 10:25.910
Ooh, ladies.

10:26.001 --> 10:26.956
( chuckles )

10:27.044 --> 10:28.329
You know that guy?

10:28.420 --> 10:29.660
Gary Ragel.

10:29.755 --> 10:32.997
Newest hotshot to come out
of IASA astronaut training.

10:33.091 --> 10:34.297
Watch your back.
He's got ambition.

10:34.384 --> 10:37.751
Gary Ragel has tentacles.
-Yeah.

10:37.846 --> 10:40.804
Oh, my God! Oh, my God,
it's a straight boy!

10:40.891 --> 10:42.176
What? He looks normal to you?

10:42.267 --> 10:43.882
It's a lifestyle choice.

10:43.977 --> 10:46.935
Anyways, his looks are the least
of his problems. He's a jerk.

10:47.022 --> 10:50.640
Hey, D.K., how you doin', huh?

10:50.734 --> 10:53.066
Ooh! Missed it there.
How you goin'?

10:53.153 --> 10:54.609
You almost ran us down, Ragle.

10:54.696 --> 10:56.687
Yeah, not even close,
my friend.

10:56.782 --> 10:58.113
How you doin'?
My name's Gary Ragle.

10:58.200 --> 10:59.690
I know you.
You are John Crichton.

10:59.785 --> 11:01.321
I've heard you're
one hell of a flyer.

11:01.411 --> 11:03.151
Let's go get a beer.

11:03.247 --> 11:04.453
We don't have time for a beer.

11:04.540 --> 11:07.156
Oooh, no time for beer!

11:07.251 --> 11:08.661
Beer?

11:09.378 --> 11:10.117
Keys.

11:10.212 --> 11:11.327
(clicks tongue)

11:13.841 --> 11:19.632
My friend, one thing you have
to learn. There is always
time for beer.

11:21.390 --> 11:23.506
I got a theory, though.
You wanna hear it?

11:23.600 --> 11:24.806
( laughs )

11:24.893 --> 11:26.508
Yo.

11:27.437 --> 11:28.973
( imitates gunshot)

11:30.816 --> 11:33.057
This is an experiment.

11:33.151 --> 11:35.187
Somebody's messing with my mind.

11:35.279 --> 11:37.395
Trying to see which way
I'll move next.

11:37.489 --> 11:40.572
Sort of like a rat in a maze
kind of thing, huh?

11:40.659 --> 11:41.819
That's right.

11:41.910 --> 11:44.287
I am some alien's personal
science project.

11:44.371 --> 11:47.329
I so know how you feel.

11:47.416 --> 11:50.749
You know, life's a bitch.
Let's get another drink. Hey!

11:50.836 --> 11:52.792
I got a plan, though.

11:52.880 --> 11:55.622
'Cause they're testing for
reactions to the freak show?

11:55.716 --> 11:57.581
Uh-huh.

11:57.676 --> 11:59.837
I'm not going to react.

12:00.679 --> 12:02.670
Let 'em deal with that.

12:03.432 --> 12:04.717
( laughs )

12:04.808 --> 12:06.344
Yeah!

12:09.271 --> 12:12.729
(Playing quiet jazz)

12:19.865 --> 12:21.730
Yow!

12:22.326 --> 12:25.568
Hey, buy a girl a drink?

12:25.662 --> 12:28.620
Oh, my God!

12:28.707 --> 12:31.870
The off-duty doctor! Join us!

12:31.960 --> 12:37.045
Gary Ragel meet
Dr. Bettina Fairchild.

12:37.591 --> 12:38.421
Ooh.

12:40.344 --> 12:42.300
( chuckles )

12:48.644 --> 12:51.306
Excuse me, you two know
each other?

12:51.396 --> 12:53.978
No.
-Never met.

12:54.066 --> 12:55.306
How about another, yeah?

12:55.400 --> 12:56.230
What?

12:56.318 --> 12:57.808
Another drink! More drink!

12:57.903 --> 13:01.111
Come on, huh?!
Three more drinks!

13:01.198 --> 13:02.278
You know.

13:02.366 --> 13:04.152
Yeah, I got it.

13:16.797 --> 13:19.163
Pitcher of beer?
-Sure, buddy.

13:19.257 --> 13:20.508
Dig your style, Ringo.

13:20.592 --> 13:22.298
John, we haven't got much time.

13:22.386 --> 13:25.048
Twins. Pity your mother.

13:25.138 --> 13:28.801
Now you listen to me.
He... he's not real.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.341
Oh, right.

13:31.436 --> 13:33.597
You are.

13:33.689 --> 13:36.351
So, what's your name?
Who do you play in
this fun house?

13:36.441 --> 13:39.979
You know my name. Scorpius.

13:40.654 --> 13:42.440
Scorpy.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.279
You don't fit the pattern.

13:45.367 --> 13:48.575
You got no Halloween costume,
got no assumed name.

13:48.662 --> 13:51.119
You're not playing a role.

13:51.206 --> 13:54.289
That suggests something to me.

13:54.376 --> 13:59.211
That suggests that you are the
man behind the party!

13:59.297 --> 14:02.585
In fact, I'm the only one
that can help you.

14:02.676 --> 14:04.166
So, what are you looking
for this time?

14:04.261 --> 14:05.876
You looking for wormholes
again, huh?!

14:05.971 --> 14:08.053
In fact, I have to
leave now, John.

14:08.140 --> 14:11.098
Nah, you aren't going anywhere!

14:11.810 --> 14:14.142
(gasping)

14:35.250 --> 14:37.411
Okay, let's talk.

14:37.502 --> 14:42.121
You're no Zhaan, you're not a
psychiatrist, but you're
as close as we'll get to either one.

14:42.215 --> 14:43.204
I'm flattered somewhat.

14:43.300 --> 14:45.586
Look, somebody is
gaslighting me.

14:45.677 --> 14:47.508
It's probably Scorpius.
It's got... gotta be Scorpius.

14:47.596 --> 14:50.929
Been having hot flashes of the
bastard ever since he stuck me
in the Aurora Chair.

14:51.016 --> 14:53.223
What am I supposed to think?
Uh, what is this?

14:53.310 --> 14:55.926
Uh... I never left Earth?

14:56.021 --> 15:00.731
Uh-uh, the whole Moya thing
is-is an illusion?
It's-it's a dream?

15:00.817 --> 15:03.229
What does that get him?

15:03.320 --> 15:05.185
The thing is, he didn't
start out too badly.

15:05.280 --> 15:06.895
You know?

15:06.990 --> 15:09.527
Th-they didn't make the
mistakes that the
last guys made.

15:10.202 --> 15:11.408
Even Aeryn.

15:11.495 --> 15:13.156
Even Aeryn, I could
have bought.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.157
Probably not, but I-l-l
could have bought it.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.034
Aeryn.

15:17.125 --> 15:19.116
You may have caught a glimpse
of Dr. Fairchild.

15:19.211 --> 15:21.042
She treated you after
your crash.

15:21.129 --> 15:26.669
Yeah, and my feverish
imagination turns her into a
Peacekeeper chick.

15:29.930 --> 15:31.841
So, what's the game?

15:34.434 --> 15:37.016
I wish I could help you,
Mr. Crichton.

15:37.938 --> 15:40.145
It's strange.

15:42.234 --> 15:44.850
I miss Moya.

15:44.945 --> 15:48.779
A ship full of aliens
becomes so normal.

15:48.865 --> 15:52.153
There is, of course,
another interpretation
for your confusion.

15:52.244 --> 15:53.950
Yeah.

15:54.037 --> 15:56.403
I'm still on Moya.

15:57.207 --> 15:58.868
I'm gibbering.

15:58.959 --> 16:03.248
I'm drooling, and everybody's
wondering what finally
made me snap.

16:03.338 --> 16:05.249
That is one possibility.

16:08.552 --> 16:10.042
Maybe.

16:15.433 --> 16:17.594
Son? Got some news.

16:17.686 --> 16:19.017
Oh yeah, what is it?

16:19.104 --> 16:21.186
IASA has brought in a new
project administrator.

16:21.273 --> 16:22.479
A Douglas Logan.

16:22.566 --> 16:24.306
You can't afford to piss
this guy off, John.

16:24.401 --> 16:25.811
He's a tough bastard.

16:25.902 --> 16:27.312
So what?

16:29.489 --> 16:34.950
Listen, tough guy or not,
right now, your future's
in his hands.

16:35.036 --> 16:42.078
Thin face, pale skin, bad set
of choppers, likes leather?

16:42.169 --> 16:44.956
I've only talked to him on
the phone. I don't know.

16:46.256 --> 16:49.043
Nasty piece of work, though.

16:49.134 --> 16:51.876
Nasty? Excellent.
Let's talk to him.

16:52.804 --> 16:54.419
Crichton:
Come on!

16:57.893 --> 16:59.224
Whoa.

16:59.311 --> 17:01.051
Nice digs, man.

17:01.146 --> 17:02.101
(whirring )

17:02.189 --> 17:04.851
Hey! Come in. You're late.

17:04.941 --> 17:07.648
Guido! You're here!

17:07.736 --> 17:09.647
Ho, hey, fellas meet
the new boss.

17:09.738 --> 17:11.478
Not the same as the old boss.

17:11.573 --> 17:13.313
Mr. Logan, please excuse
my son. He's...

17:13.408 --> 17:14.614
Shut up!

17:14.701 --> 17:18.285
So, you're the reckless son of
a bitch who refused to abort,

17:18.371 --> 17:21.488
fainted and wrecked a
multizillion-dollar module.

17:21.583 --> 17:23.323
That's me.

17:23.418 --> 17:25.033
Ah... astronauts.

17:25.128 --> 17:26.868
Cockier than God, all of them.

17:26.963 --> 17:31.332
Give me one reason I shouldn't
fire your ass and shut down
the whole Farscape project.

17:31.426 --> 17:34.964
D.K.:
Sir, the project could bring
great benefits to this organization.

17:35.055 --> 17:38.218
John's experiment will pave
the way for deep space
exploration, sir.

17:38.308 --> 17:39.593
Cork it already!

17:39.684 --> 17:41.140
Crichton:
D. Logan!

17:41.228 --> 17:42.343
Quit with the cards.

17:42.437 --> 17:43.347
Now, listen up.

17:43.438 --> 17:46.350
IASA can't afford
another failure.

17:46.441 --> 17:49.399
We get your sorry project right
on the second attempt.

17:49.486 --> 17:51.226
Quit it with the cards!

17:51.321 --> 17:54.859
People will forget
about the first.

17:56.076 --> 17:57.236
Second attempt?

17:57.327 --> 18:00.114
Yes. The one ljust authorized.

18:00.205 --> 18:03.618
Now, either you can fly it,
or Gary Ragel can.

18:03.708 --> 18:08.293
I hate to reward failure but
it's better P.R. if you fly it.

18:08.380 --> 18:12.043
Public loves
"come from behind" wins.

18:12.133 --> 18:14.465
John, the module could be
ready within two weeks.

18:14.552 --> 18:16.167
You can do it again, son.

18:16.263 --> 18:17.423
Prove your theory is correct.

18:17.514 --> 18:19.095
( chuckles )

18:19.182 --> 18:20.718
So, that's the play?

18:20.809 --> 18:23.141
Ha. The play.

18:23.228 --> 18:25.935
The play, the play is the thing.

18:26.022 --> 18:27.853
l reenact...

18:27.941 --> 18:29.522
my initial mission.

18:29.609 --> 18:35.855
I show you how I create the
giant blue twister that
sucks me down to Oz.

18:35.949 --> 18:39.282
( screeching )

18:40.036 --> 18:41.196
Forget about it.

18:41.288 --> 18:42.494
Don't know how I did it.

18:42.580 --> 18:43.956
Crichton...

18:44.040 --> 18:46.372
Hey, Scorp! Are you out
of your mind?!

18:46.459 --> 18:49.496
You think if I knew howl did
it, I would help you?!

18:49.587 --> 18:50.838
Get lost!

18:50.922 --> 18:53.083
Who the hell are you
talking to?

18:53.174 --> 18:55.130
Oh, um...

18:55.218 --> 18:56.719
not you.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.509
You're not real.
-What?l

19:00.390 --> 19:02.301
Mr. D. Logan.

19:02.392 --> 19:04.724
Wh... where are you going?

19:04.811 --> 19:06.142
What the hell was that about?

19:06.229 --> 19:08.311
Are you trying to sink the
Farscape project?

19:08.398 --> 19:11.231
D.K.:
The guy gives us a second
chance and you throw it back in his face.

19:11.318 --> 19:13.104
Hi girls. The guy?!

19:13.194 --> 19:18.564
The guy, the guy, t-the guy's
a two-foot green slug
on-on a golf cart!

19:18.658 --> 19:21.035
What does a man's disability
have to do with anything?

19:21.119 --> 19:23.451
Rygel:
Crichton? Crichton!

19:24.706 --> 19:28.494
Son, apologize to him, please.

19:28.585 --> 19:31.042
Crichton, I wasn't finished
with you.

19:31.129 --> 19:33.666
Oh honey, I'm sorry.
Let's kiss and make up.

19:35.383 --> 19:37.214
Oh! Are you deranged?!

19:37.302 --> 19:38.587
Well, yes, of course lam.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.464
Let me show you howl
crash-landed... -How dare you!

19:40.555 --> 19:42.261
the Farscape module.
-|'|| have your hide!

19:42.349 --> 19:44.840
There's an elipso-magnetic flow!

19:44.934 --> 19:48.142
So we had to abort! Abort now!
Go! -Hey! Hey! No, Crichton!

19:48.229 --> 19:49.639
Go!
-Help! Oh, no!

19:49.731 --> 19:51.141
Crichton!

19:51.232 --> 19:53.359
( screaming )

19:54.027 --> 19:55.483
( loud thud )

19:56.196 --> 19:58.152
(sighs)

19:59.282 --> 20:00.647
(sighs)

20:01.326 --> 20:02.691
What?

20:03.703 --> 20:05.159
It ain't real.

20:05.246 --> 20:07.111
They made you up out
of my memories.

20:07.207 --> 20:11.166
It's just annoying that you're
acting exactly the way I
thought you would.

20:11.252 --> 20:13.584
You... look at you, look at
you. You're crapping yourself

20:13.671 --> 20:15.832
because you think you're going
to lose yourjob and Dad,

20:15.924 --> 20:19.667
you're just pissed off 'cause
lain't playing the game
your way.

20:20.970 --> 20:23.347
It is annoying.

20:24.140 --> 20:25.676
Go away.

20:25.767 --> 20:27.758
Go home, home, go home.

20:27.852 --> 20:29.308
Shoo.

20:31.189 --> 20:33.225
( contemporary jazz playing )

20:39.197 --> 20:40.061
Hey, hey.

20:40.156 --> 20:41.236
Woman:
Hey.

20:46.037 --> 20:47.243
Hey.

20:49.582 --> 20:52.915
gComo esta, hombre?

20:53.002 --> 20:55.960
John, I want you to meet a good
friend of mine. This is Jessica.

20:56.047 --> 20:57.708
Crichton:
Oh my God.

20:57.799 --> 20:59.835
Everybody's finally here.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.382
You're an astronaut, too?

21:01.469 --> 21:02.299
Yeah.

21:02.387 --> 21:04.173
Oh.

21:04.264 --> 21:07.222
Oh, I like astronauts.

21:07.308 --> 21:09.264
You're an astronaut groupie?

21:09.352 --> 21:10.933
Yeah.

21:11.020 --> 21:13.432
That so works for me.

21:14.232 --> 21:15.847
You want to go for a drive?

21:15.942 --> 21:17.603
No, John.

21:18.361 --> 21:20.192
We must speak.

21:21.322 --> 21:23.313
Does anybody see the...

21:23.408 --> 21:25.990
freak in the next booth?

21:26.077 --> 21:27.066
D'Argo:
Uh...

21:27.162 --> 21:27.947
nope.

21:30.665 --> 21:32.166
Then, let's go for a drive.

21:32.250 --> 21:33.160
D'Argo:
Yeah!

21:33.251 --> 21:35.242
(laughing and yelling)

21:35.336 --> 21:38.043
We're on fire!

21:38.131 --> 21:40.122
Yeah!

21:40.216 --> 21:42.252
Come on, John.
You're driving like a chicken!

21:42.343 --> 21:43.594
Aye, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi!

21:43.678 --> 21:45.339
I got a new theory on life.
You wanna hear it?

21:45.430 --> 21:47.386
Oh yeah, man. Lay it on me.
Lay it on me.

21:47.474 --> 21:50.136
Life sucks, nothing matters,

21:50.226 --> 21:52.478
screw it all, let's party!

21:52.562 --> 21:55.144
I am so there!
-Me, too!

21:55.231 --> 21:57.267
Enjoy it while it lasts,
Johnny boy.

21:57.358 --> 21:59.849
You betcha, especially
when nothing's real.

22:01.404 --> 22:04.111
(hooting and laughing)

22:04.199 --> 22:06.440
This is no time to be
having fun, John.

22:07.160 --> 22:08.149
Get lost.

22:08.244 --> 22:09.495
( growls )

22:09.579 --> 22:11.786
You've got to focus.

22:11.873 --> 22:13.204
Fight this delusion.

22:13.291 --> 22:15.327
What, like I believe anything
that you'd say?

22:15.418 --> 22:16.498
Get over it.

22:16.586 --> 22:17.871
John...

22:17.962 --> 22:20.294
John, listen to me.

22:20.381 --> 22:23.088
It's time to bail, Scorpy.

22:23.927 --> 22:25.417
(yelling)

22:27.555 --> 22:30.012
(screaming, glass shattering )

22:33.353 --> 22:35.344
Good morning.

22:35.438 --> 22:37.724
The truck won, I'm afraid.

22:40.401 --> 22:41.652
And how are our friends?

22:41.736 --> 22:43.067
Gary and Jessica?

22:43.154 --> 22:44.143
Mm, yeah.

22:44.239 --> 22:45.274
They're fine.

22:45.365 --> 22:47.151
Hey.
-Hmm?

22:47.242 --> 22:51.155
As a doctor, don't you think
a crash like that would
have killed us?

22:51.246 --> 22:54.864
Well, we were very, very lucky.

22:55.250 --> 22:56.956
Oh, yeah.

22:57.752 --> 22:58.741
Now.

22:58.836 --> 22:59.666
Hmm?

22:59.754 --> 23:01.119
You have a visitor.

23:01.214 --> 23:04.081
Ooh. Who?

23:04.175 --> 23:05.790
Dad? D.K.?

23:05.885 --> 23:07.261
Someone new.

23:07.345 --> 23:09.506
A Sheyang?

23:10.890 --> 23:12.801
Captain Bialar Crais?

23:12.892 --> 23:14.223
Bring him on.

23:25.321 --> 23:27.937
Thank God you're okay.

23:31.035 --> 23:33.287
I came as soon as I could.

23:34.330 --> 23:35.536
Dont

23:37.041 --> 23:39.453
This is a pretty good trick,

23:40.670 --> 23:43.457
considering you're dead,

23:44.132 --> 23:45.668
Mom.

23:46.968 --> 23:49.175
I had to come.

23:50.138 --> 23:51.469
Oh, sweetheart.

23:51.556 --> 23:54.468
Uh... You're not real.

23:54.559 --> 23:56.299
You're sweating.

23:57.437 --> 23:59.052
Don't worry.

23:59.147 --> 24:01.058
Don't worry. There.

24:01.149 --> 24:03.640
(whispering ):
I'll make everything all right.

24:03.735 --> 24:05.726
There, my Johnny.

24:05.820 --> 24:08.812
There, there... there.

24:11.075 --> 24:13.612
That's it, yes.

24:21.669 --> 24:23.455
You've changed.

24:23.546 --> 24:26.253
People change to survive.

24:27.175 --> 24:30.087
But did you have to
lose so much?

24:32.597 --> 24:35.304
You were so innocent.

24:35.391 --> 24:37.643
So full of wonder.

24:39.228 --> 24:40.934
It's all gone.

24:41.022 --> 24:43.638
You've become callous.

24:43.733 --> 24:45.439
You've killed.

24:49.322 --> 24:51.563
You can't know that.

24:53.910 --> 24:56.367
It's true, isn't it?

24:57.330 --> 25:00.288
That's what bothers you.

25:00.375 --> 25:02.912
That's why you can't
sleep nights.

25:07.757 --> 25:09.338
I sleep fine.

25:10.677 --> 25:11.837
Where are you going?

25:11.928 --> 25:14.510
Away from something that
isn't my mother.

25:15.640 --> 25:18.347
Are you going to leave without
saying good-bye?

25:31.489 --> 25:33.605
All right, let's do this.

25:33.700 --> 25:35.031
Let's talk.

25:35.118 --> 25:36.233
What about?

25:36.327 --> 25:37.828
About what's going on.

25:37.912 --> 25:39.743
Well, I'm on my break, my man.

25:39.831 --> 25:43.949
Why don't you give me
a break, my man.

25:44.043 --> 25:45.283
Well, that's all I've got
for you, man.

25:45.378 --> 25:48.085
I don't know you and I don't
care for your problems.

25:49.674 --> 25:52.165
Great. You're not the guy.

25:52.260 --> 25:56.173
You're not the guy I
need to talk to.

25:56.264 --> 25:58.004
Hey, Col. Col Get this
man a drink.

25:58.099 --> 25:59.088
Coming up.

25:59.183 --> 26:00.389
John?

26:03.104 --> 26:04.435
Help me.

26:09.610 --> 26:11.191
You're not real.

26:11.279 --> 26:13.361
I need you.

26:14.449 --> 26:16.155
I'm afraid.

26:16.242 --> 26:19.234
You're... you're not real.
They pulled you out of my mind.

26:19.328 --> 26:21.660
You died five years ago!

26:22.665 --> 26:24.075
John...

26:26.002 --> 26:27.663
I'm scared.

26:27.754 --> 26:30.416
| just want out of this.

26:32.800 --> 26:35.177
Stay with me this time.

26:36.012 --> 26:37.718
Be with me when I go.

26:37.805 --> 26:39.341
No, please...

26:39.432 --> 26:41.764
Please, ple...

26:42.810 --> 26:43.765
Please.

26:43.853 --> 26:46.094
No, no. Oh, god.

26:46.189 --> 26:48.680
This is cruel. This is cruel.

26:48.775 --> 26:50.106
Please don't.

26:50.193 --> 26:53.185
I need you with me.

26:53.279 --> 26:54.894
Please don't.

26:55.782 --> 26:57.773
Don't do this to me!

26:59.827 --> 27:02.660
(screaming):
Don't do this to me!

27:05.208 --> 27:07.369
(sobbing)

27:14.383 --> 27:16.590
You got a problem, pal?

27:16.677 --> 27:20.044
Oh, well. If it isn't the
good Captain.

27:20.139 --> 27:23.347
Would I be patrolling a beat
if I'd made captain?

27:23.434 --> 27:26.050
Hell, I'm still bucking to
transfer to plainclothes.

27:26.145 --> 27:28.227
And give up the uniform.

27:28.314 --> 27:29.850
Bad choice.

27:29.941 --> 27:34.856
Say, you're that John Crichton
guy, aren't you?

27:34.946 --> 27:36.311
That astronaut.

27:37.323 --> 27:39.188
I don't know.

27:39.283 --> 27:40.193
A few too many, huh?

27:40.284 --> 27:41.990
I don't know who I am anymore.

27:42.078 --> 27:45.286
You better come back to the
station with me and
sleep it off.

27:45.373 --> 27:47.238
Just leave me alone.

27:47.333 --> 27:49.039
Please, just...

27:49.126 --> 27:51.287
I'm gonna get you off the
streets, mister.

27:51.379 --> 27:52.744
Leave me alone. Don't!

27:54.090 --> 27:55.205
Leave me alone!

27:55.299 --> 27:57.039
Leave... me!

27:57.134 --> 27:58.670
Me! Me! Me!

28:05.977 --> 28:07.842
(door opening)

28:07.937 --> 28:09.848
Oh my.

28:10.606 --> 28:11.857
Look at this.

28:11.941 --> 28:14.023
Ah, Mr. Crichton.

28:14.110 --> 28:15.850
Delighted to see you again.

28:15.945 --> 28:18.106
We were just discussing
your future.

28:18.197 --> 28:19.528
Oh, I don't have a future.

28:19.615 --> 28:21.321
Not in this reality.

28:21.409 --> 28:23.240
Son, you're in no shape
for this.

28:23.327 --> 28:24.237
Clearly feverish.

28:24.328 --> 28:26.910
Zhann:
John, be careful.

28:26.998 --> 28:29.865
You're risking a full
cognitive dislocation.

28:29.959 --> 28:34.168
Oh, I'm about as cognitively
dislocated as it gets,

28:34.255 --> 28:37.122
but I am clear on one thing.

28:37.216 --> 28:44.258
Scorpy can, ah, either let me
loose or watch me go berserk.

28:44.348 --> 28:46.384
More berserk, I'd say.

28:46.475 --> 28:49.933
You seem obsessed with
this Scorpius person.

28:50.021 --> 28:51.227
Can you tell us why?

28:51.314 --> 28:52.975
Can't be healthy for you.

28:53.065 --> 28:55.226
Crichton:
You're not real.

28:55.318 --> 28:58.936
Or... you're in on the plot.

29:01.574 --> 29:05.943
Either way, it doesn't really
matter what I do.

29:12.001 --> 29:13.207
I'm disappointed in you.

29:13.294 --> 29:15.751
You're holding us up, John.

29:20.676 --> 29:24.840
Can we please get on with
our meeting now?

29:24.931 --> 29:26.137
Is anyone else hungry?

29:26.223 --> 29:27.212
I'm starving.

29:27.308 --> 29:28.343
Shall we send out for
some lunch?

29:28.434 --> 29:30.550
Oh, anything but Thai food.

29:32.396 --> 29:33.146
Pizza?

29:33.230 --> 29:34.390
No, I'm sick of pizza.
How about deli?

29:34.482 --> 29:35.767
Corned beef on white for me.

29:35.858 --> 29:43.526
Stop!

29:43.616 --> 29:46.858
Have you any idea how much
trouble you're in?

29:51.248 --> 29:52.863
Yeah.

29:53.250 --> 29:54.660
Do you?

29:54.752 --> 29:57.414
I like your style, hombre.
But this is no laughing matter.

29:57.505 --> 29:59.587
Assault on a police officer.

29:59.674 --> 30:01.380
Theft of police property.

30:01.467 --> 30:03.549
Illegal possession
of a firearm.

30:03.636 --> 30:06.173
Five counts of attempted
murder.

30:06.263 --> 30:09.596
That comes to $29.40.

30:09.684 --> 30:11.800
Cash, check or credit card?

30:11.894 --> 30:13.430
(metal clanking )

30:17.024 --> 30:18.400
Toto.

30:25.032 --> 30:28.900
This thing is going completely
off the rails.

30:32.915 --> 30:35.076
Or maybe I have.

30:37.003 --> 30:38.709
Not yet, you haven't.

30:38.796 --> 30:40.582
But there's a danger you will.

30:40.673 --> 30:42.709
(mocking laugh)

30:42.800 --> 30:44.711
You're here.

30:44.802 --> 30:47.043
Did you bring the keys?

30:47.138 --> 30:49.379
It's not me that's doing
this, John.

30:50.516 --> 30:52.256
It's a Scarran.

30:53.602 --> 30:56.514
He captured you on the
Commerce Planet.

30:56.605 --> 30:58.186
I don't know any Scarrans.

30:58.274 --> 31:00.139
What would a Scarran
want with me?

31:00.234 --> 31:03.442
Well, now that the Scarrans
know I'm after you, they
want to know why.

31:03.529 --> 31:05.235
This is their...

31:05.322 --> 31:07.313
standard method of
interrogation.

31:07.408 --> 31:11.242
Induced delusions to break down
all mental defenses.

31:12.413 --> 31:15.450
The Scarrans aren't trying
to fool you, John.

31:17.668 --> 31:20.751
They're trying to break you.

31:20.838 --> 31:24.205
This is a deliberate attempt to
drive you into insanity

31:24.300 --> 31:25.631
and it's working.

31:25.718 --> 31:27.674
Your mind is about to crack,

31:27.762 --> 31:30.344
and I cannot allow that.
l was here first.

31:31.348 --> 31:32.929
No, you weren't.

31:33.350 --> 31:35.181
True.

31:35.269 --> 31:38.602
The Ancients were here first,
implanting the wormhole
knowledge I seek.

31:38.689 --> 31:42.807
But when my Aurora Chair failed
to unlock that information,

31:42.902 --> 31:46.520
I had to implement a
second strategy.

31:46.614 --> 31:47.945
( screaming )

31:53.662 --> 31:55.744
You put something in my head.

31:55.831 --> 31:57.913
A very sophisticated neurochip.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.241
It contains...

32:00.336 --> 32:05.046
well, it contains me.

32:05.132 --> 32:08.841
Or a mental clone of
my personality.

32:11.013 --> 32:13.129
That explains the visions
I've been having.

32:13.224 --> 32:15.055
Precisely.

32:15.142 --> 32:16.552
l was supposed to have
remained hidden,

32:16.644 --> 32:19.886
but now and then your
subconscious would become
aware of me.

32:27.404 --> 32:30.771
That's why I couldn't kill you
on the Royal Planet?

32:30.866 --> 32:32.242
Of course.

32:32.326 --> 32:34.282
A simple fail-safe.

32:34.370 --> 32:36.201
But my main function

32:36.288 --> 32:40.327
is to access the wormhole
knowledge you have
in your brain,

32:40.417 --> 32:42.373
no matter how long that takes.

32:43.420 --> 32:45.706
(high-pitched giggle)

32:45.798 --> 32:47.584
You're Harvey.

32:49.009 --> 32:51.045
Or is it Clarence?

32:51.137 --> 32:52.502
Guardian Angel?

32:52.596 --> 32:54.097
Invisible rabbit?

32:54.181 --> 32:55.421
Harvey...

32:56.767 --> 32:58.143
Harvey.

32:58.227 --> 33:00.013
Does the Scarran know
you're here?

33:00.104 --> 33:04.564
I only manifest myself when the
Scarran's attention is
elsewhere, as it is now.

33:04.650 --> 33:07.312
I must disappear when
he returns.

33:07.403 --> 33:10.816
Ignore the false Scorpius
he's created.

33:13.242 --> 33:16.530
And do not confide in anyone
else you may encounter.

33:18.247 --> 33:21.114
How do I know you're
telling the truth?

33:21.208 --> 33:23.290
You're sweating, John.

33:23.377 --> 33:26.540
You've been unusually hot
all this time because...

33:26.630 --> 33:32.341
because your real body is
reflexively responding to heat.

33:33.387 --> 33:35.002
The heat...

33:36.307 --> 33:38.889
a Scarran produces.

33:38.976 --> 33:41.012
And when your body temperature
lessens slightly,

33:41.103 --> 33:44.140
the Scarran is elsewhere,
preparing another onslaught.

33:44.231 --> 33:46.643
It must not succeed.

33:48.235 --> 33:50.100
How do I stop it?

33:50.196 --> 33:51.481
Focus.

33:51.572 --> 33:53.278
Concentrate on what is real.

33:53.365 --> 33:56.072
Your true memories of Earth,
of Moya.

33:56.160 --> 33:58.902
Your family, friends.
Even your enemies.

33:58.996 --> 34:02.113
Do not allow yourself to be
pushed over the edge.

34:02.208 --> 34:03.914
But remember this.

34:04.001 --> 34:06.663
The Scarran has not
disarmed you.

34:06.754 --> 34:09.336
Your weapon is of no
consequence to a Scarran.

34:09.423 --> 34:12.756
Their skins are extremely tough.

34:12.843 --> 34:16.176
Pistol fire will not kill a
Scarran before he kills you.

34:17.306 --> 34:20.764
So, your best chance is
not to shoot but...

34:21.268 --> 34:23.350
But to what?

34:24.230 --> 34:26.221
The temperature's rising.
I must go.

34:26.315 --> 34:27.430
To what?

34:28.442 --> 34:30.307
Harvey!

34:30.402 --> 34:32.358
But to what?!

34:32.446 --> 34:34.357
( snarling )

34:41.372 --> 34:44.114
You look like you're ready
to have some fun.

34:44.208 --> 34:45.323
We certainly are.

34:45.417 --> 34:46.406
(chuckling)

34:46.502 --> 34:47.662
What are you doing?

34:47.753 --> 34:49.038
Nothing you won't like.

34:49.129 --> 34:52.166
Nothing you haven't already
fantasized about.

34:52.258 --> 34:56.297
Zhaan:
Admit it. You've had sexual
thoughts about all of us, haven't you?

34:56.387 --> 34:57.342
Not me.

34:57.429 --> 34:58.384
Oh, come on.

34:58.472 --> 34:59.803
You're a male.

34:59.890 --> 35:02.506
It's just the way you are wired.

35:02.601 --> 35:06.264
Nothing to be ashamed of,
not when females are willing.

35:06.355 --> 35:07.891
Say, what's your pleasure, boss?

35:07.982 --> 35:10.314
I'm a doctor. Just relax.

35:10.401 --> 35:11.857
I can wear a Freudian slip.

35:11.944 --> 35:14.026
I find new places to take
your temperature.

35:14.113 --> 35:17.230
I can teach you left handed
Latvian rodeo torture.

35:17.324 --> 35:20.487
Rygel:
All of you bitches out now.

35:20.577 --> 35:23.944
Crichton is mine.

35:24.039 --> 35:25.620
( lapping repeatedly)

35:25.708 --> 35:29.121
This is for calling me Sparky.

35:29.211 --> 35:31.418
And this is for Fluffy.

35:31.505 --> 35:34.338
And this is for Buckwheat,
(snickering )

35:34.425 --> 35:36.336
whatever that means.

35:38.470 --> 35:40.131
( distant baby crying )

35:46.270 --> 35:48.352
D.K.:
Oh! Leaving so soon?!

35:48.439 --> 35:49.849
I wish I could!

35:49.940 --> 35:51.100
Look what you made me do, John!

35:51.191 --> 35:52.977
I opened my veins!

35:53.068 --> 35:55.024
You've made me lose myjobl

35:55.112 --> 35:57.569
You dumped me for your new pals!

35:57.656 --> 36:01.114
Some friend you are!

36:01.201 --> 36:04.329
Some friend you are, man!

36:04.413 --> 36:05.994
( screams )

36:06.081 --> 36:07.116
Oh, come on, Papa Bear!

36:07.207 --> 36:09.744
Look at what depths your son
has driven us to.

36:09.835 --> 36:11.291
Don't look at me.

36:11.378 --> 36:12.538
You're the one who
wanted a child.

36:12.629 --> 36:13.835
I wanted a terrier.

36:13.922 --> 36:15.583
Oh, you couldn't give me
what I really wanted.

36:15.674 --> 36:17.414
Oh, so we get this loser!

36:17.509 --> 36:19.761
He can't fetch a ball,
he can't get my slippers,

36:19.845 --> 36:23.337
he can't even land a damn
Module in one piece!
-Oh, no! My baby!

36:23.432 --> 36:26.595
( screaming )

36:26.685 --> 36:28.471
(siren wailing)

36:31.148 --> 36:32.604
Freeze!

36:32.691 --> 36:34.522
You're under arrest.

36:34.610 --> 36:37.022
You have the rights to the
remains of a silent attorney!

36:37.112 --> 36:39.774
If you cannot afford one,
tough noogies!

36:39.865 --> 36:41.651
You can make one phone call!

36:41.742 --> 36:43.278
| recommend Trixie,

36:43.369 --> 36:45.610
976-555-LOVE.

36:45.704 --> 36:48.366
Do you understand these rights
as l have explained them
to you?!

36:48.457 --> 36:50.197
Well, do you, punk?!

36:50.292 --> 36:51.907
No.

36:52.002 --> 36:53.538
Then I can't arrest you!

36:54.588 --> 36:55.703
John...

36:55.798 --> 36:58.255
I really need to just
unburden myself on you.

36:58.342 --> 37:00.048
What?

37:00.135 --> 37:05.129
Well, lately, I've been
thinking about you in
a very different way.

37:05.224 --> 37:06.589
Uh-huh.

37:06.683 --> 37:09.174
Mm-hmm... And I was wondering
if you would mind participating
with me

37:09.269 --> 37:11.760
in a little Luxan
bonding ritual.

37:11.855 --> 37:13.356
Here's the thing, okay?

37:13.440 --> 37:17.149
What we need are some chains...

37:17.236 --> 37:18.726
Uh, my Qualta Blade...

37:18.821 --> 37:21.904
just a little squirt of
lutra oil and...

37:21.990 --> 37:23.150
Oh!

37:23.242 --> 37:24.197
Chiana.

37:24.284 --> 37:25.319
(giggling)

37:25.411 --> 37:26.400
Chiana.

37:26.495 --> 37:27.905
Yeah.

37:27.996 --> 37:29.782
She wants to watch.

37:29.873 --> 37:31.374
Oh, no.

37:33.669 --> 37:35.830
Oh, yes.

37:38.924 --> 37:41.506
Such a fascinating library
you have.

37:41.593 --> 37:44.926
Such wonderful,
informative books.

37:46.348 --> 37:48.304
"Oedipus Complex"?

37:50.602 --> 37:55.141
I'm not sure I grasp
that concept.

37:56.608 --> 37:59.099
Could you, um...

37:59.194 --> 38:01.401
explain it to me, Johnny?

38:01.947 --> 38:03.562
No.

38:03.657 --> 38:06.273
Oh, please.

38:06.368 --> 38:10.862
You're such a smart boy.

38:10.956 --> 38:12.947
I really...

38:13.041 --> 38:15.248
I really want to know.

38:17.754 --> 38:18.914
Ohh...

38:19.006 --> 38:21.463
(dance music plays)

38:27.848 --> 38:29.384
( laughs )

38:31.268 --> 38:32.223
Hey,Johnl

38:32.311 --> 38:35.599
Get down and boogie!

38:36.231 --> 38:38.563
Boogie-oogie-woogie!

38:39.651 --> 38:42.028
Hey, man! Get down!

38:42.112 --> 38:45.696
Boogie or die!

38:45.782 --> 38:48.114
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

38:48.202 --> 38:54.163
( echoing ):
I don't boogie!

39:07.513 --> 39:10.255
Crichton!

39:10.349 --> 39:13.682
Crichton, where are you?
Where are you?

39:13.769 --> 39:16.260
Where are you? Where are you?

39:16.355 --> 39:18.266
Clear the dance floor!

39:18.357 --> 39:20.689
Clear the dance floor!

39:20.776 --> 39:23.563
Clear the dance floor!

39:37.793 --> 39:40.125
I searched half this
world for you.

39:42.839 --> 39:44.625
Where am I?

39:44.716 --> 39:48.629
Still on the Commerce Planet,
but underground in some sort
of holographic chamber.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.802
l destroyed the projector.

39:52.099 --> 39:53.134
Who nabbed me?

39:53.225 --> 39:54.431
Scorpius.

39:54.518 --> 39:55.428
Sc...

39:55.519 --> 39:57.305
I killed him.

39:57.396 --> 39:59.762
Scorpius...

39:59.856 --> 40:04.316
Was, um... he was behind this?

40:04.403 --> 40:05.939
"Was" being the operative word.

40:07.864 --> 40:09.024
That's interesting.

40:09.116 --> 40:10.105
Why is it interesting, John?

40:10.200 --> 40:12.577
It'sjust... it's just
that he, uh...

40:12.661 --> 40:14.242
Tell me.

40:21.211 --> 40:22.951
Later.

40:23.046 --> 40:24.911
Lets,uhu.

40:26.133 --> 40:27.373
let's get out of here.

40:27.467 --> 40:28.502
No.

40:28.594 --> 40:30.425
Tell me now.

40:38.937 --> 40:40.928
No.

40:41.023 --> 40:43.264
No, you get nothing from me.

40:45.944 --> 40:48.105
Frell you then.

40:48.196 --> 40:49.902
Stay.

41:01.043 --> 41:03.284
(dance music playing)

41:11.637 --> 41:14.720
Boogie or die!

41:15.474 --> 41:16.884
Hey, yo!

41:16.975 --> 41:19.261
Kiss my...

41:19.936 --> 41:21.142
(two pounding beats)

41:21.229 --> 41:22.890
...friend you are, man!

41:22.981 --> 41:23.970
(single pounding beat)

41:24.066 --> 41:24.930
...thinking about you...

41:25.025 --> 41:26.105
(two pounding beats)

41:26.193 --> 41:27.603
Then I can't arrest you!

41:27.694 --> 41:29.195
(two pounding beats)

41:29.279 --> 41:30.940
Be with me when I go.

41:31.031 --> 41:32.271
(single pounding beat)

41:48.256 --> 41:51.419
Brain wave patterns are
increasingly irregular.

41:51.510 --> 41:53.592
The captive is finally
weakening.

41:53.679 --> 41:57.467
Increasing stimuli to
calvo nine.

41:57.557 --> 41:59.718
( high-pitched whirring )

42:01.937 --> 42:04.269
Calvo ten.

42:05.399 --> 42:06.809
( high-pitched whirring )

42:06.900 --> 42:08.356
(guttural growling)

42:12.447 --> 42:15.280
(whirring intensifies)

42:23.166 --> 42:25.157
Dead?

42:27.754 --> 42:30.621
(guttural growling)

42:32.259 --> 42:39.176
All neural activity ceased
at 635 apneth one.

42:39.266 --> 42:45.387
Captive apparently suffered
full synaptic overload at
stimulus level calvo ten.

42:46.606 --> 42:51.100
Because no baseline data exists
with this species,

42:51.194 --> 42:54.982
this reaction could not have
been anticipated.

42:55.073 --> 42:58.281
Remains of the captive will
be held for...

42:58.368 --> 43:00.074
( beeping )

43:01.413 --> 43:03.620
(beeping quickens and
intensifies )

43:25.520 --> 43:27.181
(yelling)

43:45.707 --> 43:47.288
Well done, John.

43:48.210 --> 43:49.950
What happened?

43:50.045 --> 43:53.162
I feel like... I died.

43:53.256 --> 43:56.498
I had to stop your brain
function for a few microts,

43:56.593 --> 43:58.504
to divert the Scarran.

43:58.595 --> 44:00.256
No harm done.

44:00.347 --> 44:03.214
I'll go back into your
subconscious mind now.

44:04.434 --> 44:07.221
Don't get too comfortable.

44:07.312 --> 44:10.770
I'm gonna get that chip
out of my head.

44:10.857 --> 44:12.973
There's no chip in your
head, John.

44:14.903 --> 44:16.313
Yeah, there is.

44:16.404 --> 44:18.235
You told me...

44:21.326 --> 44:23.408
There's a, um...

44:23.495 --> 44:26.328
(slurring ):
men... men...

44:26.414 --> 44:28.120
You were saying?

44:28.208 --> 44:30.620
M-mental chip...

44:34.381 --> 44:36.212
Uh, you were saying?

44:36.299 --> 44:38.551
What am I saying?

44:38.635 --> 44:40.000
I'm...

44:41.555 --> 44:43.341
As it should be.

44:44.015 --> 44:46.267
I won't trouble you again.

44:47.185 --> 44:49.221
Until I need to.

44:49.312 --> 44:52.145
There's an exit to your left,
which will no doubt take
you back

44:52.232 --> 44:54.644
to the surface of this
Commerce Planet.

44:55.735 --> 44:58.898
I leave you to your
shipmates, John.

44:58.989 --> 45:00.274
But rest assured,

45:00.365 --> 45:02.777
I'll be with you always,

45:02.868 --> 45:04.950
keeping you safe.
