04:07.819 --> 04:09.485
He's not going to run away.

04:09.487 --> 04:11.487
He's going to face his problem.

04:11.489 --> 04:12.888

Maybe he shouldn't be
wearing underwear. What?!

04:20.829 --> 04:22.361

for Ralph to leave that school.

04:30.570 --> 04:33.437
He is smarter than everyone
there, including the teachers.

04:33.439 --> 04:35.505

04:41.611 --> 04:44.211
Tweaked Walt's voice
adaptation software.

04:44.213 --> 04:46.413
It'll record the basic
tone of anyone's voice,

04:46.415 --> 04:47.881
then it perfectly mimics
whatever you type in.

04:49.484 --> 04:51.484
And it is clearly not
the time to unveil it.

04:51.486 --> 04:52.935
(car horn honks twice)

04:52.936 --> 04:54.385
Thank God

04:54.388 --> 04:55.804
Sweetheart, I want you

04:55.805 --> 04:57.221

Principal Pastorneck.

04:57.224 --> 04:58.957
Don't. I can handle this.

04:58.959 --> 05:00.625

Unfortunately, it's

05:19.774 --> 05:22.358
Why don't you
gather your team?

05:22.359 --> 05:24.943
I found a confidential informant
murdered in my prison today,

05:24.945 --> 05:27.312
and it was over these
pieces of paper.

05:27.314 --> 05:28.797
Assume you all heard
of the federal judge

05:28.798 --> 05:30.281
who was gunned down at midnight
in his own home last week.

05:30.283 --> 05:31.682
CABE:
Heard about it on the news.

05:31.684 --> 05:34.017
This got something
to do with that?

05:34.019 --> 05:36.552
Yes, the Japanese gang<i> Eh-Ta-Me</i>
has been running operations

05:36.554 --> 05:38.320
out of Harrison Prison
for years.

05:38.322 --> 05:41.656
My dead CI, member of the
gang in question, advised me

05:41.658 --> 05:43.691
that the hit on that judge
was going down a month ago.

05:43.693 --> 05:46.326
As we were verifying
his information,

05:46.328 --> 05:47.527
judge was killed.

05:47.529 --> 05:48.961
Information verified.

05:48.963 --> 05:52.698
Same CI handed me these three
slips of paper yesterday.

05:52.700 --> 05:56.535
He's part of the chain
that illegally transports

05:56.537 --> 05:58.003
gang messages out of Harrison.

05:58.005 --> 05:59.537
You can't read this gibberish,

05:59.539 --> 06:01.472
only top-level gang
leaders are fluent in it.

06:01.474 --> 06:05.476
But he overheard that these are
the names of three more judges

06:05.478 --> 06:07.945
to be assassinated
by midnight tonight.

06:07.947 --> 06:09.913
Believe it's in retaliation
for harsh sentences

06:09.915 --> 06:13.650
handed down in past months to
high-level gang lieutenants.

06:13.652 --> 06:15.652
We won't know who's next
if we can't decipher this code.

06:15.654 --> 06:17.320
Can't you just seclude
all the federal judges

06:17.322 --> 06:19.088
until you know
who's being targeted?

06:19.089 --> 06:20.855
Then every time a threat is
made, our judiciary shuts down?

06:20.858 --> 06:22.757
It's not an option.

06:22.759 --> 06:24.425
There are 3,000 federal judges,
eight-hour shifts per day,

06:24.427 --> 06:27.428
two agents per shift, that means
we'd need over 20,000 agents

06:27.430 --> 06:28.762
to provide blanket protection.

06:28.764 --> 06:30.797
Our government doesn't have
those resources.

06:30.799 --> 06:32.799
Considering our ticking clock, I
thought it best to come to you.

06:32.801 --> 06:34.534
WARDEN:
I'm desperate for help.

06:34.536 --> 06:37.003
I was sent to Harrison three
months ago to clean it up,

06:37.005 --> 06:38.671
but I don't know who to trust.

06:38.673 --> 06:40.773
Even my deputy warden's suspect.

06:40.775 --> 06:44.376
Makes $48K a year,
drives a $70,000 car.

06:45.545 --> 06:46.877
But this is the guy.

06:46.879 --> 06:48.545
He's keeping everyone
on his payroll.

06:48.547 --> 06:50.880
Shima Funukoshi.

06:50.882 --> 06:52.548
Head of the<i> Eh-Ta-Me.</i>

06:52.550 --> 06:54.883
Shot-caller for the whole joint.

06:54.885 --> 06:58.086
Shima's weak but can walk,
suffering from kidney failure.

06:58.088 --> 06:59.754
But no one messes with this guy.

06:59.756 --> 07:02.056

nubuck leather seats

07:02.058 --> 07:03.424

07:04.326 --> 07:06.426
His chair's nicer
than Walter's car.

07:06.428 --> 07:07.593
SYLVESTER: And his code
is no less impressive.

07:07.595 --> 07:09.461
Bilingual,
alpha-numeric language

07:09.463 --> 07:10.695
with symbolic interface.

07:10.697 --> 07:12.430
For encryption
this complex,

07:12.432 --> 07:13.898
there needs to be
a user manual somewhere

07:13.900 --> 07:17.067
to decipher these messages,
because this code is a beast.

07:17.069 --> 07:19.602
MAN: I searched every inch
of the prison

07:19.604 --> 07:22.605
to find any clue that might shed
light on these communications,

07:22.607 --> 07:24.373
but I couldn't find a thing.

07:24.375 --> 07:25.374
Have you checked the library?

07:25.376 --> 07:26.508
'Cause he didn't take out

07:26.510 --> 07:28.376
any books for six years,

07:28.378 --> 07:31.078
and then he took out
over 20 over the course

07:31.080 --> 07:33.080
of two weeks a few months back.

07:33.082 --> 07:35.482
A manual in someone's cell
would be easy to find,

07:35.484 --> 07:37.083
but hidden in the pages
of library books...

07:37.085 --> 07:39.085
I noticed the
checkout activity too,

07:39.087 --> 07:41.087
and I poured through
every book he read,

07:41.089 --> 07:42.555
and I didn't find anything
that looked like this.

07:42.557 --> 07:44.273
Well, no offense,

07:44.274 --> 07:45.990
but you may have missed
something one of us would see.

07:45.993 --> 07:49.094
A reference to certain symbols
equating certain letters.

07:49.096 --> 07:50.095
Underline.

07:50.097 --> 07:51.362
A dot above a number.

07:51.364 --> 07:52.629
A circled word.

07:52.631 --> 07:54.097
It would take a
computer-like brain

07:54.099 --> 07:56.732
to identify a manual
as camouflaged as this.

07:56.734 --> 07:59.568
If you brought us the books,
we could work on it immediately.

07:59.570 --> 08:01.770
I got over 200 personnel
working in Harrison,

08:01.772 --> 08:03.738
any of whom can be
in Shima's pocket.

08:03.740 --> 08:05.740
If just one of them realizes

08:05.742 --> 08:08.075
that I'm checking out
scores of textbooks...

08:08.077 --> 08:10.077
sets off an alarm.

08:10.079 --> 08:13.613
If they realize that
I'm photocopying the books...

08:13.615 --> 08:15.147
sets off an alarm.

08:15.149 --> 08:18.150
If Shima or one
of his boys realizes

08:18.152 --> 08:19.684
the books are missing...

08:19.686 --> 08:20.518
TOBY:
Wait, I know this one.

08:20.520 --> 08:21.986
Sets off an alarm.

08:21.988 --> 08:23.153
CADE:
Shima finds out,

08:23.155 --> 08:24.687
changes his code,

08:24.689 --> 08:25.821
the location of the manual,

08:25.823 --> 08:27.689
goes back to
taking out judges.

08:27.691 --> 08:29.557
So the books have to stay
in the library.

08:29.559 --> 08:31.625
But we still need to get
genius eyes on them.

08:31.627 --> 08:33.727
Not any genius eyes.

08:33.729 --> 08:36.596
Eyes that can report
visuals to a brain

08:36.598 --> 08:39.498
that can memorize
reams of data.

08:40.033 --> 08:41.932
Uh... no.

08:41.934 --> 08:43.433
A brain that spots patterns
others don't see

08:43.435 --> 08:45.601
and decrypt code
faster than anyone.

08:45.603 --> 08:48.070
Amusement parks, fun houses,

08:48.072 --> 08:50.605
a store near my home
called "Le Sexy Hutch,"

08:50.607 --> 08:51.939
and theme restaurants--

08:51.941 --> 08:53.941
all places I will not
voluntarily walk into,

08:53.943 --> 08:56.576
but number one on
my list is prisons.

08:56.578 --> 08:59.579
Let me present you
with another circumstance.

08:59.581 --> 09:03.182
Three judges are dead by morning
you could have helped.

09:03.184 --> 09:05.918
I know you, you can't carry
that on your conscience.

09:05.920 --> 09:07.920
If you need to find
a reason to do it, Sly,

09:07.922 --> 09:09.922
do it for selfish reasons.

09:09.924 --> 09:11.156
Do it for yourself.

09:13.760 --> 09:15.826
(hip-hop music plays)

09:21.199 --> 09:24.200
It won't stay on
if you don't stop sweating.

09:24.202 --> 09:26.569
WALTER: Your record's been
input into the prison system.

09:26.571 --> 09:29.572
Psychotic serial killer, sadism,
torture, multiple counts.

09:29.574 --> 09:31.907
We just need a name
for this psychopath.

09:31.909 --> 09:34.576
Jackson Wyles.

09:34.578 --> 09:36.611
Clinically speaking,
he looks like a psycho.

09:38.448 --> 09:39.680
What's your jacket?

09:39.682 --> 09:41.782
I... I think it's polyester.

09:41.784 --> 09:46.119
In prison, your jacket
is your rap sheet, okay?

09:46.121 --> 09:48.121
Let's-let's try this again.

09:48.123 --> 09:49.956
Yo, you got beef?

09:49.958 --> 09:51.724
You mean, like lunch meat?

09:53.060 --> 09:55.860
This molar cap's
a transmitter and a receiver.

09:55.862 --> 09:57.862
The jaw bone sends
sound waves to your inner ear.

09:57.864 --> 10:00.531
No one will hear but you.

10:00.533 --> 10:02.065
And you know how
to implant this, right?

10:02.067 --> 10:04.133
Would you relax?
I went to med school.

10:04.135 --> 10:05.701
Not dental school, though.

10:05.703 --> 10:07.035
(groaning):
Oh. Oh, God.

10:07.037 --> 10:08.803
I tapped into the prison's
security cameras,

10:08.805 --> 10:10.688
we can see you from here,

10:10.689 --> 10:12.572
we can control when the guards
see you on their monitors.

10:12.575 --> 10:13.907
We'll be with you
the whole time.

10:13.909 --> 10:16.576
You get in, find the code's
manual, memorize it,

10:16.578 --> 10:18.811
the warden brings you back,
90 minutes tops.

10:18.813 --> 10:20.879
I'm the only one who knows
who you really are.

10:20.881 --> 10:23.014
I'm the only one
who matters.

10:23.016 --> 10:24.081
You'll be fine.

10:29.054 --> 10:33.589
Inmate number 984325J,
Jackson Wyles.

10:33.591 --> 10:34.923
Ready for gen pop.

10:34.925 --> 10:36.525
I'll walk him in.

10:36.526 --> 10:38.126
Want him to know
we don't tolerate nonsense.

10:39.929 --> 10:41.995
(lock buzzes,
door slides open)

10:42.931 --> 10:44.730
(lock buzzes)

10:48.068 --> 10:50.068
Go in looking like
this, you're dead.

10:50.070 --> 10:52.070
Remember, you're
a killer.

10:52.072 --> 10:53.604
I'm-I'm a killer.

10:53.606 --> 10:56.106
They should be
scared of you.

10:56.108 --> 10:58.908
You got to stare
'em right through.

10:58.910 --> 11:00.142
Breathe a bit
through your mouth.

11:02.179 --> 11:03.111
Like a predator.

11:03.113 --> 11:04.245
(hisses)

11:04.247 --> 11:06.146
Yeah. There you go.

11:06.148 --> 11:08.114
Now you go settle
into your cell,

11:08.116 --> 11:10.549
and I'll bring you
to the library shortly.

11:10.551 --> 11:12.117
You can do this.

11:12.119 --> 11:13.551
I can do this.

11:13.553 --> 11:14.218
Yeah.

11:21.026 --> 11:22.959
I can't do this.

11:22.961 --> 11:24.026
W-w-wait.

11:24.028 --> 11:27.996
(inmates clamoring)

11:30.000 --> 11:31.666
Oh, boy.

11:41.310 --> 11:43.543
Sir. Anything you need
from the library?

11:43.545 --> 11:45.144
Just making the rounds.

11:46.847 --> 11:48.913
I have a library pass.

11:50.182 --> 11:52.682
You new here, fish?

11:52.684 --> 11:54.984
I have a library pass.

11:56.053 --> 11:58.720
That's not smooth, Sylvester.

11:58.722 --> 12:00.788
I'm trying to stay alive.

12:00.790 --> 12:02.756
I'm not worried about smooth.

12:02.758 --> 12:04.090
TOBY: If you don't pass
as the real deal,

12:04.092 --> 12:05.591
you won't stay alive.

12:05.593 --> 12:06.792
Be supportive. What
is more  supportive

12:06.794 --> 12:08.126
than wanting someone
to stay alive?

12:12.799 --> 12:14.031
Sylvester, are you finding
anything in those texts?

12:14.033 --> 12:16.767
Nothing yet.
The warden was right.

12:16.769 --> 12:18.235
There's nothing here.

12:18.237 --> 12:20.036
There's got to be something.
You're missing it.

12:20.038 --> 12:21.037
The books are pristine.

12:21.039 --> 12:22.204
There's not a mark on them.

12:23.173 --> 12:24.605
Hold on...

12:24.607 --> 12:25.739
TOBY:
I know that tone.

12:25.741 --> 12:26.940
That's his
"I found something" tone.

12:26.942 --> 12:29.042
What do you see, kid?

12:29.044 --> 12:31.144
More like what<i> don't</i> I see.

12:31.146 --> 12:32.945
It's a diagram
of the human body

12:32.947 --> 12:34.579
with no organs in it.

12:34.581 --> 12:36.213
But there are ridges
in the spine,

12:36.215 --> 12:37.914
pieces of acetate.

12:37.916 --> 12:39.048
Those books are
a med school staple.

12:39.050 --> 12:40.716
You lay over one acetate page

12:40.718 --> 12:42.084
that shows the digestive tract,

12:42.086 --> 12:43.618
another page
lays in the heart.

12:43.620 --> 12:45.686
Four or five pages,
you get all the major organs.

12:45.688 --> 12:48.021
TOBY:
Two shelves down:

12:48.023 --> 12:50.656
<i> Annals of Urban</i>
<i> Infrastructure--</i> 713.01.

12:50.658 --> 12:53.358
Next,<i> Waynecroft's</i>
<i> Veterinary Sciences--</i>

12:53.360 --> 12:55.626
636.089.

12:58.130 --> 13:01.097
All right. Acetate has been
ripped from<i> Gray's Anatomy,</i>

13:01.099 --> 13:02.665
<i> The Life Cycle of Plants,</i>

13:02.667 --> 13:03.766
and<i> The History of</i>
<i> the Combustion Engine.</i>

13:03.768 --> 13:04.767
The warden was right.

13:04.769 --> 13:05.968
There's-there's nothing dubious

13:05.970 --> 13:07.302
about what was in those books.

13:07.304 --> 13:09.637
What is suspect
is what's been taken from them.

13:09.639 --> 13:12.339
Are there enough missing pages
to create a manual?

13:12.341 --> 13:14.607
Rough estimate: 20 to 25 pages.

13:14.609 --> 13:15.674
So where are
the pages now?

13:15.676 --> 13:17.008
Shima wouldn't keep them
in his cell.

13:17.010 --> 13:18.642
That'd be the first place
someone would look.

13:18.644 --> 13:20.810
The warden's
already searched it.

13:22.046 --> 13:23.378
WALTER:
Shima's bad kidneys.

13:23.380 --> 13:25.680
He needs dialysis treatment.

13:25.682 --> 13:28.182
3 hours a day, 3 days a week
he's in the infirmary?

13:28.184 --> 13:29.983
That's a perfect place

13:29.985 --> 13:32.652
for a guard or nurse that's on
the take to turn a blind eye.

13:32.654 --> 13:34.253
All that time alone.
He can use his manual,

13:34.255 --> 13:36.455
write kill orders
in secret code,

13:36.456 --> 13:38.656
send it to his boys on
the outside, never get caught.

13:38.659 --> 13:40.992
Sylvester,
you're in the wrong place.

13:40.994 --> 13:43.060
You need to get the warden
to take you to the infirmary.

13:43.062 --> 13:45.228
(quietly): I can't get you
into the infirmary.

13:45.230 --> 13:46.796
You have to.

13:46.798 --> 13:49.165
That's where we think Shima's
hiding the code's manual.

13:49.167 --> 13:51.200
If you think
something's fishy

13:51.202 --> 13:52.734
going on in sick bay,

13:52.736 --> 13:54.168
then I don't know
who to trust in there.

13:54.170 --> 13:55.869
If I bring you in
on the first day

13:55.871 --> 13:57.403
with a headache,
they'll know something's up.

13:57.405 --> 13:59.037
Only inmates

13:59.039 --> 14:01.272
with serious issues
get med passes.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.307
So what do we do?

14:03.309 --> 14:05.309
Uh, Sylvester...

14:05.311 --> 14:06.810
you and I are about to have

14:06.812 --> 14:08.678
a very uncomfortable
conversation.

14:08.680 --> 14:11.080
(inmates chatter,
basketball bounces)

14:12.383 --> 14:13.682
TOBY:
Okay.

14:13.684 --> 14:15.283
We got eyes on you in the yard.

14:15.285 --> 14:17.652
Now we just need to find

14:17.654 --> 14:18.753
the biggest,
baddest con out there.

14:18.755 --> 14:20.387
For you to pick
a fight with.

14:20.389 --> 14:21.722
This is directly contrary

14:21.723 --> 14:23.056
to the advice that we gave
to Ralph this morning.

14:23.058 --> 14:24.123
We told him to run away.

14:24.125 --> 14:25.958
I don't recall
that conversation.

14:25.960 --> 14:27.726
I've never been
in a fight in my life.

14:27.728 --> 14:29.094
PAIGE: You...

14:29.096 --> 14:30.662
look very tough, Sylvester.

14:30.664 --> 14:31.362
Really?

14:32.331 --> 14:33.663
Okay. Nine o'clock.

14:33.665 --> 14:34.964
That's your man.

14:36.434 --> 14:38.233
The mountain in the tank top?

14:38.235 --> 14:39.200
Come on, man!

14:39.202 --> 14:40.768
(man grunts)

14:40.770 --> 14:41.435
Give me the ball!

14:41.437 --> 14:42.702
TOBY:
Yep.

14:42.704 --> 14:44.170
Go kick his ass, Sylvester.

14:46.174 --> 14:48.007
Yeah!

14:48.009 --> 14:49.975
That's how it's done, son.

14:49.977 --> 14:51.376
Who got next? Yeah.

14:51.378 --> 14:53.277
I want some playas!

14:53.279 --> 14:55.779
Oh, my God.
Who wants some?

14:55.781 --> 14:57.347
Ten-Ton wants a real game!

14:57.349 --> 14:59.882
Now who... What?

15:00.851 --> 15:02.050
What the hell you want?

15:02.052 --> 15:03.985
TOBY:
To teach you a lesson, punk.

15:03.987 --> 15:06.087
To teach you...

15:06.089 --> 15:07.088
Oh, God...

15:07.090 --> 15:08.355
TEN-TON:
You on my court.

15:08.357 --> 15:09.856
Speak up, before I get angry.

15:09.858 --> 15:12.692
I would like to teach you
a lesson... punk.

15:12.694 --> 15:14.794
'Scuse me?

15:16.931 --> 15:19.231
What, are you...

15:19.233 --> 15:21.399
ugly<i> and</i> deaf?

15:22.702 --> 15:24.435
Like yo' momma?

15:24.437 --> 15:26.069
Easy does it, Doc.

15:26.071 --> 15:28.171
We want him to get punched,
not murdered.

15:28.173 --> 15:31.741
Hey, trick, I don't care
how many people you killed.

15:31.743 --> 15:33.409
This is my house

15:33.411 --> 15:35.377
and I will stop your air.

15:36.947 --> 15:38.780
So step off.

15:38.782 --> 15:41.182
He's got a black-and-white
striped bandana on his hip.

15:41.184 --> 15:42.950
He's a 4th Street Jester.

15:42.952 --> 15:44.452
Tear off his gang colors.

15:44.453 --> 15:45.953
No, I don't want to.
I don't want to.

15:45.955 --> 15:47.754
I don't care
if you don't "want to."

15:47.756 --> 15:50.123
Oh. No, I...
I wasn't talking to you.

15:50.125 --> 15:51.924
I was talking to somebody else.

15:51.926 --> 15:53.792
Yo, this fish is crazy.

15:53.794 --> 15:55.794
(chuckling) HAPPY: You're not offending
him, you're entertaining him.

15:55.796 --> 15:57.195
Now disrespect his colors

15:57.197 --> 15:59.196
or I'll make what he does to you
look like a massage.

16:02.968 --> 16:05.168
I'm sorry.

16:06.204 --> 16:08.837
I have allergies.

16:08.839 --> 16:09.838
(blows nose)

16:09.840 --> 16:10.839
Damn.

16:12.275 --> 16:14.374
I didn't expect him
to go that far. Mmm.

16:17.178 --> 16:18.844
Ooh!

16:18.846 --> 16:20.111
(all groaning)

16:21.881 --> 16:24.781
(gunshot)
Everyone back to Gen Pop!

16:27.018 --> 16:28.417
You heard me, inmate.

16:28.418 --> 16:29.817
Gen Pop or solitary,
your choice.

16:29.820 --> 16:32.987
You and me ain't done.

16:35.157 --> 16:36.956
That was hard to watch.

16:36.958 --> 16:38.490
It was necessary.
He had no choice.

16:42.028 --> 16:43.861
Connors, take this idiot
to the infirmary.

16:43.863 --> 16:46.163
Sylvester, if you're okay,
scratch your head.

16:50.202 --> 16:52.068
Hello? Sylvester?
Can you hear me?

16:53.404 --> 16:55.470
Guys, are you there?

16:55.472 --> 16:56.838
(exhales anxiously)

16:56.840 --> 16:58.472
Uh-oh. Check this out.

17:01.243 --> 17:02.408
Is that what
I think it is?

17:02.410 --> 17:03.909
His back left molar.

17:03.911 --> 17:06.478
Now we know why
he can't hear us.

17:06.480 --> 17:08.213
He's stuck in there on his own.

17:09.516 --> 17:11.482
This is bad.

17:17.356 --> 17:18.855
Okay, now,
move it side to side.

17:20.458 --> 17:22.024
I think I have
a spiral fracture.

17:22.026 --> 17:23.091
I need an X-ray.

17:23.093 --> 17:24.325
If you had a spiral fracture,

17:24.327 --> 17:25.459
you wouldn't have
your range of motion.

17:25.461 --> 17:27.260
I should know about mandibulars.

17:27.262 --> 17:29.195
I've dismembered
nine transients.

17:29.197 --> 17:30.930
(sighs) Would you like
a malpractice suit?

17:30.932 --> 17:31.931
I'm in prison.

17:31.933 --> 17:32.998
I've got nothing else to do.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.233
I'll be back with the imager.

17:39.939 --> 17:41.438
WALTER: Okay. He got
the doctor to leave,

17:41.440 --> 17:43.540
but he won't be
alone for long.

17:43.542 --> 17:45.174
So I'm killing a camera feed
from the infirmary

17:45.176 --> 17:46.575
to the guards.

17:46.577 --> 17:47.809
They'll just think
that the monitors

17:47.811 --> 17:48.943
are briefly malfunctioning.

17:48.945 --> 17:50.044
It's such a big space.

17:54.583 --> 17:55.782
Manual could be anywhere.

17:55.783 --> 17:56.982
Look for the hemodialysis
machine, you big lug.

17:56.985 --> 17:58.551
They're huge!
Check that back room!

17:58.553 --> 18:00.252
You know he can't hear you,
so why are you yelling?

18:00.254 --> 18:01.920
You hate to dance,
why are you going to a club?

18:01.922 --> 18:03.588
Seems like we all do things
that don't make sense.

18:03.590 --> 18:06.958
Ooh! There you go, buddy!
Right back there.

18:06.960 --> 18:09.060
(quietly):
Yes!

18:13.232 --> 18:15.832
Think. Think...

18:15.834 --> 18:17.900
If I were a murderous gang lord
with a bad kidney

18:17.902 --> 18:19.534
who had to sit in here all day,

18:19.536 --> 18:21.402
where would I hide the manual?

18:22.505 --> 18:24.471
That's it--
sitting here all day.

18:24.473 --> 18:25.538
He's immobile.

18:35.516 --> 18:37.849
Huh...

18:39.886 --> 18:41.585
Holy moly.

18:47.292 --> 18:49.391
What is taking him so long?

18:53.063 --> 18:55.630
The legend page is missing.

18:55.632 --> 18:58.332
Uh, there he is.

18:58.334 --> 19:01.201
I can't decipher this.

19:01.203 --> 19:03.636
Already found the pages,
the Warden gets him out,

19:03.638 --> 19:06.438
you guys untangle the code
and we go save those judges.

19:11.478 --> 19:12.610
CABE:
We got a problem.

19:12.612 --> 19:14.378
They're bringing in
a patient, fast.

19:17.483 --> 19:18.482
Hurry up, Sly.

19:18.484 --> 19:19.583
He still can't hear you.
I know.

19:20.552 --> 19:22.652
Start an I.V.,
normal saline.

19:22.654 --> 19:24.520
Ten units insulin, sub-Q.
Finger-stick blood sugar.

19:24.522 --> 19:26.655
What's going on?
Is that the warden?

19:26.657 --> 19:28.323
Irregular pulse.
Potassium must be high--

19:28.325 --> 19:30.258
make it 20 units.
Where the hell are the EMTs?

19:30.260 --> 19:31.993
What is going on?

19:31.995 --> 19:33.661
TOBY: That's an insulin kit
on the gurney.

19:33.663 --> 19:34.962
Warden must be diabetic.

19:34.964 --> 19:36.430
But he's got his medicine.
Then that

19:36.432 --> 19:37.798
must not have been insulin.

19:37.799 --> 19:39.165
Someone inside the prison,
on Shima's payroll,

19:39.168 --> 19:41.568
must've replaced that insulin
with something else.

19:41.570 --> 19:43.503
They took out the warden's CI,
the next logical move

19:43.505 --> 19:47.073
is to take out the warden.

19:47.075 --> 19:48.491
Look-- they're hustling him out.

19:48.492 --> 19:49.908
The only person in Harrison
who knows that Sylvester

19:49.911 --> 19:52.077
isn't really a prisoner
is out of the picture.

19:52.079 --> 19:53.945
(lock buzzes, lock clanks)

19:58.384 --> 19:59.483
I, uh, really didn't

19:59.485 --> 20:01.318
get my jaw checked out.

20:01.320 --> 20:02.652
Could I can wait in sick bay?

20:02.654 --> 20:05.655
Doc's got more important things
right now than you.

20:19.703 --> 20:21.636
TOBY: It's a gazelle
through the lions.

20:25.942 --> 20:27.474
Looks delicious.

20:39.587 --> 20:41.653
Just like high school.

20:42.689 --> 20:44.221
Listen good, boy.

20:44.223 --> 20:47.590
You disrespect my colors,
you disrespect me.

20:50.094 --> 20:51.393
See that guard over there?

20:53.263 --> 20:54.996
That's my boy.

20:54.998 --> 20:58.366
At 10:00, cell block
lights out.

20:58.368 --> 21:01.402
At 10:01, my man

21:01.404 --> 21:03.303
brings me over to
pay you a visit.

21:03.305 --> 21:06.406
At 10:02,
your lights go out.

21:15.482 --> 21:17.081
Okay. He walked away.

21:17.083 --> 21:18.682
Everything's gonna be fine.

21:23.555 --> 21:24.720
You were saying?

21:24.722 --> 21:26.988
Cabe, you need to do something.

21:29.625 --> 21:31.658
I can't just call in
a transfer order to the prison.

21:31.660 --> 21:33.092
Why the hell not?
We're Homeland.

21:33.094 --> 21:34.410
Be smart.

21:34.411 --> 21:35.727
The deputy warden
is in charge now.

21:35.729 --> 21:38.229
A man that Warden Jadlow
says couldn't be trusted.

21:38.231 --> 21:40.064
If we call saying
Sylvester works for Homeland,

21:40.066 --> 21:42.566
we might as well send a hearse
instead of a transpo van.

21:42.568 --> 21:44.234
Well, just say he's needed as a
witness in a trial or something.

21:44.236 --> 21:45.335
Pull him out

21:45.337 --> 21:46.469
the same day he goes in?

21:46.471 --> 21:47.770
That shines a shady light.

21:47.772 --> 21:49.705
he will be in just
as much danger. Come on, Cabe,

21:49.707 --> 21:51.773
you're thinking with your heart
and not your head.

21:51.775 --> 21:54.642
Now, you said your man
got a look at that code.

21:54.644 --> 21:56.644
Is there any way he can get us
the data so that we can start...

21:56.646 --> 21:58.445
CABE:
I got a 22-year-old kid

21:58.447 --> 22:00.079
trapped in a maximum
security prison

22:00.081 --> 22:01.346
with a target on his back,

22:01.348 --> 22:03.014
and you want to talk to me
about that case?!

22:03.016 --> 22:04.749
ADRIANA: I am asking
about something that can

22:04.751 --> 22:07.785
the lives of three Federal
judges who die within hours.

22:07.787 --> 22:09.520
We have to prioritize!

22:09.522 --> 22:11.221
I'm trying to save those judges,

22:11.223 --> 22:14.023
but not without
saving my man, too.

22:15.793 --> 22:17.325
She can't pull him out?

22:17.327 --> 22:19.727
Saving Sly is
not on her to-do list.

22:19.729 --> 22:22.262
We can't just leave him there.
You have to pull some strings.

22:22.264 --> 22:24.197
The only strings I can pull
take a hell of a lot longer

22:24.199 --> 22:26.098
than the six hours we have
before they come after him.

22:26.100 --> 22:27.799
TOBY: I told him that he wasn't
gonna be able to live with himself

22:27.801 --> 22:30.034
if he didn't do this.
Now I'm not gonna be able

22:30.036 --> 22:31.502
to live with myself
if something happens to him.

22:31.504 --> 22:33.370
We got to find a way
to get them to release him.

22:33.372 --> 22:35.706
They'll never
release him in time.

22:35.707 --> 22:38.041
That's why our only option is to
break Sylvester out of prison.

22:46.551 --> 22:49.084
Read 'em and weep-- the
schematics of the prison.

22:49.086 --> 22:50.385
Looks airtight.

22:50.387 --> 22:51.419
Vents?

22:51.421 --> 22:52.620
Nothing with outside access.

22:52.622 --> 22:53.721
Can we Shawshank it?

22:53.723 --> 22:55.222
The sewage pipes
are too narrow.

22:55.224 --> 22:56.556
Is there a way to tunnel?

22:56.558 --> 22:57.523
The prison's built on bedrock.

22:57.525 --> 22:59.124
Well, it's secure all right.

22:59.126 --> 23:00.458
But there's always
a single point of failure.

23:00.460 --> 23:01.525
What is this?

23:01.527 --> 23:02.726
This structure

23:02.728 --> 23:04.828
beneath the basement room?

23:04.830 --> 23:06.095
That room
has floor drainage.

23:06.097 --> 23:07.262
Happy, this over here?

23:07.264 --> 23:09.297
Independent cooling system.

23:09.299 --> 23:11.198
Okay, so I'd say
this room

23:11.200 --> 23:14.100
is the prison morgue
and that structure

23:14.102 --> 23:17.069
is the underground bladder
to house biomedical waste.

23:17.071 --> 23:18.603
It's a perfect extraction point.

23:18.605 --> 23:20.271
Prisoners don't have
access to it.

23:20.273 --> 23:21.305
Guards almost never have
a reason to go

23:21.307 --> 23:22.907
This water main here?

23:22.908 --> 23:24.508
TOBY: Oh, that carries
water and bleach.

23:24.510 --> 23:26.510
EPA regs say that
before biohazard trucks

23:26.512 --> 23:29.112
can pump it out and cart it off,
biohazardous waste

23:29.114 --> 23:31.114
has to be diluted
to certain specs.

23:31.116 --> 23:32.615
The water main runs right

23:32.617 --> 23:34.517
under the subterranean
access road

23:34.518 --> 23:36.418
that the biohazard trucks
must use to make pickups.

23:36.420 --> 23:37.819
So, what-- we're gonna
climb in through a pipe

23:37.821 --> 23:39.554
filled with
biohazardous backwash?

23:39.556 --> 23:41.622
No, but we're still
gonna use the pipe to get in.

23:41.624 --> 23:43.156
CABE: Even if you can
get into the morgue,

23:43.158 --> 23:44.323
how do you plan
to get Sylvester there?

23:44.325 --> 23:46.758
Short answer-- kill him.

23:49.162 --> 23:51.295
I can design a drug
that will make him appear dead.

23:51.297 --> 23:53.697
A little plenzamine
to slow the heart,

23:53.699 --> 23:56.566
sprig of dolazepam
to rev down the brain,

23:56.568 --> 23:58.234
dusting of ephedrine to make

23:58.236 --> 23:59.368
his hands
cold to the touch.

23:59.370 --> 24:01.503
Voila-- near-perfect
mimic of death.

24:01.505 --> 24:03.538
Pulse is active,
but undetectable.

24:03.540 --> 24:04.772
with breathing more shallow

24:04.774 --> 24:06.106
then the cheerleaders
at my high school.

24:06.108 --> 24:07.307
HAPPY:
Guards assume Sly's

24:07.309 --> 24:08.675
had a cardiac episode,

24:08.677 --> 24:10.176
toss him down with the stiffs.

24:10.178 --> 24:11.694
Where we will
be waiting for him.

24:11.695 --> 24:13.211
But how do we get
the drugs to Sylvester?

24:13.214 --> 24:15.180
Well, prisons are
full of narcotics,

24:15.182 --> 24:17.248
but Sly isn't plugged in there;
he doesn't know who to approach;

24:17.250 --> 24:18.682
and he'll probably
get pummeled if he did.

24:18.684 --> 24:20.850
Why do you look like
you just smelled sour milk?

24:20.852 --> 24:23.786
Because I think I know a guy
who can help us,

24:23.788 --> 24:27.689
But I'm just really,
really unsure about this.

24:27.691 --> 24:29.424
I am so glad you came
to me for help, Wally.

24:29.426 --> 24:31.125
Right from the get-go
I felt a connection between us.

24:31.127 --> 24:34.128
WALTER: Certain anything
that you felt was

24:34.130 --> 24:35.229
was completely in your head.
I'm so sorry.

24:35.231 --> 24:36.363
How rude.
You guys want some coffee?

24:36.365 --> 24:37.497
No.
No.

24:37.499 --> 24:38.698
So, we just need
your help, Ray,

24:38.700 --> 24:40.266
We need to get some
pharmaceuticals

24:40.268 --> 24:41.433
to our friend in
Harrison Prison.

24:41.435 --> 24:43.301
You got a pal in Harrison?

24:43.303 --> 24:44.302
See?

24:44.304 --> 24:46.170
I knew you were a gangster.

24:46.172 --> 24:47.304
Excuse me one second.

24:47.306 --> 24:48.271
It's been a while since

24:48.273 --> 24:49.739
I have entertained, so...

24:49.741 --> 24:51.340
Walter, maybe this was a mistake.
Pardon me, Wally.

24:51.342 --> 24:53.208
Uh, no offense, but I just
don't want Sylvester's life

24:53.210 --> 24:54.709
in the hands of a guy
who lives in a Gremlin.

24:54.711 --> 24:56.143
None taken.
It's just temporary,

24:56.145 --> 24:57.777
until my app business
takes off, see?

24:57.779 --> 24:59.411
Once I think of a good app.

24:59.413 --> 25:01.179
Ray, can you help or not?

25:01.181 --> 25:02.580
Absolutely, amigo.

25:02.582 --> 25:04.381
Please.

25:04.383 --> 25:06.249
I know this guy--

25:06.251 --> 25:07.283
BooBoo--

25:07.285 --> 25:08.484
a few years back
I cut him in

25:08.486 --> 25:10.285
on a used carpets deal
in Redondo.

25:10.287 --> 25:12.353
Carpets-- that's the wave
of the future right there.

25:12.355 --> 25:13.420
We're on a clock.

25:13.422 --> 25:16.256
BooBoo runs the...

25:16.258 --> 25:18.258
pharmacy, so to speak,
in Harrison.

25:18.260 --> 25:19.692
He can totally
hook your boy up.

25:19.694 --> 25:20.859
I just got to ask him.

25:20.861 --> 25:22.327
Set up a meeting
and in a few weeks...

25:22.329 --> 25:23.528
We don't have a few weeks.

25:23.529 --> 25:24.728
We need to get the
pills to him today.

25:24.729 --> 25:25.928
Visits are scheduled
weeks in advance.

25:25.932 --> 25:26.830
So we're screwed.

25:26.832 --> 25:27.630
Easy now, Patty.

25:27.632 --> 25:29.198
Paige.
In life,

25:29.200 --> 25:30.365
there are three ways
of getting things done--

25:30.367 --> 25:31.532
the right way,
the wrong way,

25:31.534 --> 25:33.166
and the Ray Way.

25:33.168 --> 25:35.335
And the Ray Way involves

25:35.336 --> 25:37.503
a special kind of visitation
that gets priority.

25:38.539 --> 25:39.638
<i> (lock buzzes)</i>

25:39.640 --> 25:41.606
Counselors.

25:41.608 --> 25:42.673
Attorney/client room is this way.
Hi.

25:42.675 --> 25:45.342
Very nice.
Thank you, ma'am.

25:45.344 --> 25:47.243
You know...

25:47.245 --> 25:49.245
your girl Happy makes
great fake I.D.'s.

25:49.247 --> 25:50.279
(cell phone dings)
I know a high school

25:50.281 --> 25:51.780
where we could make a mint.

25:51.782 --> 25:53.848
Trouble?

25:53.850 --> 25:55.282
My son's being
bullied in school.

25:55.284 --> 25:56.816
Oh, he'll push through it.

25:56.818 --> 25:58.284
I was bullied
a ton as a kid,

25:58.286 --> 25:59.652
and look at me now--
a lawyer.

25:59.654 --> 26:00.886
You're not a lawyer.

26:00.888 --> 26:02.287
Objection.

26:02.289 --> 26:04.355
Argumentative.

26:06.559 --> 26:08.959
This is the biggest bag
of yeast we got.

26:08.961 --> 26:09.960
You brewing beer?

26:09.962 --> 26:11.728
I'm brewing trouble, lady.

26:11.730 --> 26:13.262
Happy, what's cooking?

26:13.264 --> 26:15.230
A big batch of H2O2.

26:15.232 --> 26:16.231
Walt, you get
the wheels yet?

26:16.233 --> 26:17.432
I'm working on it.

26:18.835 --> 26:19.767
Cabe, you almost done?

26:19.769 --> 26:21.435
Just about.
Okay.

26:21.437 --> 26:22.769
(engine starts)

26:22.771 --> 26:24.604
We're in business.

26:24.606 --> 26:26.339
Now, all we need is for
your friend to deliver.

26:26.341 --> 26:28.007
Think he can handle it?

26:28.008 --> 26:29.674
Ray's not my friend,
and I don't know.

26:35.815 --> 26:37.548
You know those
are takeout menus.

26:37.550 --> 26:38.549
No...

26:38.551 --> 26:40.350
(lock buzzes)

26:43.888 --> 26:45.320
Are you holding up okay?

26:45.322 --> 26:47.388
I am in prison, Paige,

26:47.390 --> 26:48.756
about to be killed.

26:48.758 --> 26:50.390
Would you like to start
with a new question?

26:50.392 --> 26:51.858
Sorry.

26:51.859 --> 26:53.325
Good news is we're
getting you out of here.

26:53.328 --> 26:54.794
Bad news is it's
through the morgue.

26:54.796 --> 26:56.929
Through the morgue?

26:56.931 --> 26:58.864
Well, how the heck am I
supposed to get down there?

26:58.866 --> 27:01.399
So you deliver
these drugs in these doses

27:01.401 --> 27:02.366
to that guy
over there, okay?

27:02.368 --> 27:04.568
No dice.

27:04.570 --> 27:06.336
That psycho's a marked man.

27:06.338 --> 27:07.737
He pissed off Ten-Ton.

27:07.739 --> 27:09.405
You owe me.

27:09.407 --> 27:11.240
I testified on your behalf.

27:11.242 --> 27:13.408
If you want me to help...

27:13.410 --> 27:16.411
thousand bucks in my kick.

27:16.413 --> 27:17.645
Done.

27:17.647 --> 27:19.413
Homeland Security's
got you covered.

27:19.415 --> 27:20.981
So let me get this straight.

27:20.983 --> 27:22.882
Step one,
I take the pills.

27:22.884 --> 27:25.384
Step two... I die?
No.

27:25.386 --> 27:26.936
Almost die.

27:26.937 --> 27:28.487
Toby says you-you just
come close to death.

27:28.489 --> 27:30.288
You guys are unbelievable.

27:30.290 --> 27:32.356
You send me in here,
and you tell me that

27:32.358 --> 27:34.358
you're gonna be with me
the entire time,

27:34.360 --> 27:36.393
and then my comms
get knocked out of my head.

27:36.395 --> 27:38.595
My only contact
in here

27:38.597 --> 27:39.829
is comatose.

27:39.831 --> 27:42.264
And now you want me
to dabble in suicide.

27:42.266 --> 27:44.266
Well, it's not gonna happen.
I won't do it.

27:44.268 --> 27:46.034
Toby said you'd feel this way.

27:46.036 --> 27:48.402
(sighs)

27:51.673 --> 27:54.407
(sighs)

27:54.409 --> 27:56.308
Fine.

27:56.310 --> 27:58.543
I trust
Toby's drug calculations,

27:58.545 --> 28:02.013
but what if BooBoo is not the
pharmacist that we think he is.

28:02.015 --> 28:03.581
I take offense to that.

28:03.583 --> 28:04.748
Sustained.

28:04.750 --> 28:06.850
Ray swears by the guy.

28:06.852 --> 28:08.751
That brings me to
my next question.

28:08.753 --> 28:10.352
Who the hell is Ray?

28:10.354 --> 28:11.619
(whispers):
I'm Walter's new friend.

28:12.421 --> 28:14.354
Really nice to meet you.

28:14.356 --> 28:15.922
Walter trusts him,
and we are out of options.

28:15.924 --> 28:17.657
You take the pills,
we break you out,

28:17.659 --> 28:19.325
we save the judges-- easy.

28:19.327 --> 28:21.427
Not sure about
the "save the judges" part.

28:21.429 --> 28:23.929
I memorized the manual,
but the legend was missing.

28:23.931 --> 28:26.431
It's the key to the
code's use patterns.

28:26.433 --> 28:28.433
Without it, I can't decrypt the names.
Those judges

28:28.435 --> 28:30.501
die at midnight-- you have
to find the missing legend.

28:30.503 --> 28:32.402
It could be anywhere
in this place.

28:32.404 --> 28:34.604
Shima's confined to a wheelchair
90% of the day.

28:34.606 --> 28:37.607
There has to be some limit
on where he could hide it.

28:37.609 --> 28:39.308
The wheelchair.

28:39.310 --> 28:41.977
It's logical that he hides it
somewhere inside the chair.

28:41.979 --> 28:44.446
That way it's with him
but not<i> on</i> him,

28:44.448 --> 28:47.482
and it's never found. You have to
get it by 9:45, because Toby says

28:47.484 --> 28:49.484
it takes 15 minutes
for the drugs to kick in,

28:49.486 --> 28:51.586
and you have to be dead before
Ten-Ton comes to kill you.

28:51.588 --> 28:53.888
I can't believe
that sentence makes sense.

28:53.890 --> 28:55.990
(lock buzzes) Okay, you got to go.
Look at me.

28:57.026 --> 28:59.393
I believe in you;
the whole team does.

29:00.629 --> 29:01.928
RAY:
That's right,

Two cans over there,

By the time I got back, all
I saw on the surveillance feed

were the guards zipping him
in a body bag

Okay, you better be in

31:42.075 --> 31:43.607
as the HP solution
hits the water main

31:43.609 --> 31:46.109
with the yeast, it'll create
massive amounts of O2.

31:46.111 --> 31:48.544
The pressure will either blow
through the truck or the pipe.

31:48.546 --> 31:50.879

Judges die

Guys, we gotta run.

The guards are probably

33:16.750 --> 33:18.383
No, I was basically dead.

Sylvester, we can't.
The guards will catch us.

33:25.791 --> 33:27.257
Not if they can't see us.

33:27.258 --> 33:28.724
Toby, can you black out
the cameras to the guards,

33:28.727 --> 33:29.859
just like Walt's been doing?

33:29.861 --> 33:31.160
Toby, did you catch that?

I'm not a hacker,
but that should be easy enough.

Got it. Okay, you
memorized the manual,

Get to work.

Mass, to North Dakota.

37:00.460 --> 37:02.860
three dead judges
or one dead kid.

37:04.296 --> 37:05.495
I'm a Marine.

37:05.497 --> 37:07.763
"No man left behind"
means something to me.

37:07.765 --> 37:10.365

everyone involved.

37:10.367 --> 37:13.368
Don't try to politick your way
out of this.

A family.

37:41.391 --> 37:42.923
Holy TV stars.

37:42.925 --> 37:44.391
I'm here with
Ralph Dineen.

37:44.393 --> 37:46.159
Hi, Ralph.
Hello.

37:46.161 --> 37:48.094
Ralph, get in here!
Ralph, I understand

37:48.096 --> 37:51.163
you've just been accepted
to Harvard, MIT,

37:51.165 --> 37:52.297
Caltech,

37:52.299 --> 37:53.298
to name a few.

37:53.300 --> 37:54.966
Not bad for a ten-year-old.

37:54.968 --> 37:57.301
How did this happen?
I applied.

37:57.303 --> 37:58.268
REPORTER:
Really? Does your mom...

38:00.372 --> 38:01.304
Ralph...

38:01.305 --> 38:02.237
Now I'm a celebrity at school.

38:02.240 --> 38:04.173
Kids don't pick on celebrities.

38:04.175 --> 38:07.776
He's right. I mean, this was
an efficient plan involving...

38:07.778 --> 38:09.344
zero confrontation.

38:09.346 --> 38:11.012
PAIGE:
I never signed off

38:11.014 --> 38:13.047
on-on, on TV interviews.

38:15.351 --> 38:18.118
PAIGE'S VOICE: Of course you
can speak to my son Ralph.

38:18.120 --> 38:19.819
I'm so proud of him.

38:19.821 --> 38:21.153
WALTER: (chuckles)
I've been saying

38:21.155 --> 38:23.021
for months that Ralph
needs to ditch that school.

38:23.023 --> 38:24.022
RALPH: I'm staying in
elementary school.

38:24.024 --> 38:26.024
If I can't relate to humans,

38:26.026 --> 38:28.092
I'll turn out like you guys.

38:29.061 --> 38:30.026
Ouch.

38:30.028 --> 38:31.494
Uh...

38:31.496 --> 38:35.064
Okay, I-I respect your position.

38:35.066 --> 38:36.932
But you should consider

38:36.934 --> 38:38.934
taking night classes at Caltech.

38:38.936 --> 38:40.535
You have a... a gift.

38:40.537 --> 38:42.036
You should hone it.

38:42.038 --> 38:43.037
PAIGE:
Go finish

38:43.039 --> 38:44.104
your breakfast.

38:50.912 --> 38:52.978
Did you see how he took
the idea of going to college?

38:52.980 --> 38:54.512
It's exactly what I've said

38:54.514 --> 38:56.080
about him needing more
of a challenge.

38:56.082 --> 38:58.816
Hear what he said
about relating

38:58.818 --> 39:00.350
to regular people?
That's what I've been

39:00.352 --> 39:01.984
trying to do for you
for a while.

39:01.986 --> 39:04.186
And you're making progress
with me.

39:04.188 --> 39:05.387
And to continue that progress,

39:05.389 --> 39:07.222
I think
you need people in your life

39:07.224 --> 39:09.107
outside of the garage.

39:09.108 --> 39:10.991
It might sound drastic,
but I met someone today

39:10.994 --> 39:12.293
who seemed to take
a liking to you.

39:12.295 --> 39:14.061
Not Ray.
He's strange

39:14.063 --> 39:15.929
and a touch annoying,
but he's human.

39:15.931 --> 39:16.930
And he came through for us.

39:16.932 --> 39:18.231
He might be
an opportunity

39:18.233 --> 39:19.232
for growth for you.

39:19.234 --> 39:21.100
How can I, uh, put this?

39:21.102 --> 39:23.135
No.

39:24.138 --> 39:26.270
MAN:
Hello?

39:28.374 --> 39:30.073
Chet?

39:30.075 --> 39:31.140
CHET:
Hey.

39:31.142 --> 39:32.574
I missed you
at the club last night.

39:32.576 --> 39:34.242
HAPPY: Yeah.
Uh, work ran late.

39:34.244 --> 39:37.078
No worries. You maybe want
to head over there tonight?

39:37.080 --> 39:38.579
Same time?
Sure.

39:38.581 --> 39:40.847
Um, I'm gonna
walk you out.

39:43.418 --> 39:46.585
Happy, don't you want
to introduce us...

39:46.587 --> 39:48.987
...us?
(door shuts)

39:51.591 --> 39:53.123
What are you doing, Doc?

39:54.292 --> 39:57.926
Well, Freud would say
I'm beating up on myself.

39:57.928 --> 40:00.094
Ah, Happy's gentleman caller's
got you down.

40:00.096 --> 40:01.495
I get it.
You want to hit something.

40:01.497 --> 40:03.096
Yeah, like his stupid face.

40:03.098 --> 40:05.098
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.

40:05.100 --> 40:08.201
Hold this.

40:08.203 --> 40:10.503
All right...

40:10.505 --> 40:11.937
get your hands up,

40:11.939 --> 40:13.138
elbows in,

40:13.140 --> 40:14.973
and then you want
to turn your hands

40:14.975 --> 40:16.474
like you're opening
a doorknob.

40:16.476 --> 40:18.008
All right?

40:18.010 --> 40:19.175
You try.

40:21.112 --> 40:23.445
There you go.

40:23.447 --> 40:25.580
All right.
Put your weight behind it.

40:25.582 --> 40:28.149
(grunting)
Nice!

40:28.151 --> 40:29.150
Listen to that snap.

40:29.152 --> 40:31.318
There you go.

40:31.320 --> 40:32.652
SYLVESTER:<i> Megan...</i>

40:32.654 --> 40:34.186
when I was here yesterday,

40:34.188 --> 40:36.154
I wasn't 100% honest with you.

40:36.156 --> 40:38.322
There was something
I wanted to say,

40:38.324 --> 40:40.590
but... I was scared.

40:43.595 --> 40:48.230
(bird calling) This is the mating
song of the Coolangatta egret.

40:48.232 --> 40:51.132
This bird practices
lifelong fidelity.

40:51.134 --> 40:54.001
And when it knows it's
found its one true mate,

40:54.003 --> 40:55.302
it does this.

41:00.908 --> 41:03.274
(giggling)

41:05.378 --> 41:07.244
(laughing)

41:09.281 --> 41:12.982
This egret dance
describes how I feel.

41:17.921 --> 41:20.321
I feel like I'm...

41:20.323 --> 41:22.323
in love with you.

41:22.325 --> 41:24.391
(chuckles softly)

41:25.327 --> 41:27.560
I love you, too.

41:29.297 --> 41:32.298
See, that wasn't scary.

41:32.300 --> 41:35.301
Yeah, I honestly,
I don't know.

41:35.303 --> 41:37.169
Hey.
Wally!

41:37.171 --> 41:40.205
Great news, man, supervisor
just cut us loose until mañana.

41:40.207 --> 41:41.840
Really? Why?

41:41.841 --> 41:43.474
Uh, somebody wrecked
the water truck last night.

41:45.010 --> 41:49.012
You know, uh, speaking of,
uh, yesterday, I, um...

41:49.014 --> 41:50.179
(clears throat)

41:50.181 --> 41:52.481
...thank you for your help.

41:52.483 --> 41:54.015
It's what I do.

41:54.017 --> 41:56.251
I'm a problem solver.

41:56.252 --> 41:58.486
You'll learn. The Ray Way
always leads to victo-ray.

41:58.488 --> 42:01.355
Okay. Uh, anyhoo,
I was thinking,

42:01.357 --> 42:03.056
since we've got
the morning off,

42:03.058 --> 42:05.091
I was gonna lift that
paint tarp over there.

42:05.093 --> 42:07.393
Me and some of the guys, we're
gonna head up to Griffith Park,

42:07.395 --> 42:09.528
strip down to our undergear,
oil up with Crisco,

42:09.530 --> 42:12.030
and see where
gravity takes us.

42:12.032 --> 42:13.464
Like a big
Slip 'N Slide.

42:13.466 --> 42:14.465
Any interest?

42:14.467 --> 42:16.200
Not even remotely, no.

42:16.202 --> 42:18.302
Come on.
We could use a timer.

42:22.408 --> 42:24.408
I suppose I could keep time.

42:24.410 --> 42:26.243
Sweet.

42:26.245 --> 42:28.311
Let's get a move on,
brother!

42:30.381 --> 42:32.714
Now, the-the timer doesn't have
to get into his underwear

42:32.716 --> 42:34.982
and-and oil up, does he?

42:34.984 --> 42:37.050
No. Don't make
this weird, bro.
