00:03.894 --> 00:05.396
‐ That workshop,
if I hadn't taken it,

00:05.396 --> 00:06.482
I'd be so fucked.
‐ Well, you have me now.

00:06.482 --> 00:08.026
24‐hour service.

00:08.026 --> 00:09.572
I think something bad
happened to me

00:09.572 --> 00:11.367
a long time ago
when I was a child.

00:11.367 --> 00:13.037
Well, I have to
get out of here.

00:13.037 --> 00:14.707
‐ You mean leave right now?
‐ Yeah, I'm gonna

00:14.707 --> 00:16.418
talk to Harold, we'll get
our things together.

00:16.418 --> 00:18.047
- Where are we going?
- Back to New York.

00:18.047 --> 00:20.301
‐ To the compound?
‐ I'm taking it back.

00:20.301 --> 00:21.721
‐ Eddie's hired an SL.

00:21.721 --> 00:24.017
Secular Liaison.
She's a publicist.

00:24.017 --> 00:27.440
‐ I have decided to
take down the guard booth.

00:27.440 --> 00:30.280
If anyone's here,
it's time to come out.

00:31.741 --> 00:33.912
He is just a kid.
We can help him.

00:33.912 --> 00:36.333
‐ My husband's away and I need
to keep my family safe.

00:36.333 --> 00:38.421
There was a bomb threat
in Spring Valley.

00:38.421 --> 00:41.093
‐ Look, the kid is not
building a bomb.

00:45.811 --> 00:48.734
‐ My life's work is studying
new American faiths.

00:48.734 --> 00:51.363
‐ I recently
came across something

00:51.363 --> 00:52.825
that Steve used to use.

00:52.825 --> 00:54.829
The Hypoxian Cleanse.

00:54.829 --> 00:56.666
Listen, if the
Hypoxian Cleanse is in there,

00:56.666 --> 00:58.502
who knows what else there is?

01:44.010 --> 01:46.850
‐ I enjoyed the other night.

01:46.850 --> 01:48.060
‐ Me too.

01:48.060 --> 01:51.526
‐ Because you seemed, uh...

01:51.526 --> 01:53.028
I couldn't tell if‐‐

01:53.028 --> 01:55.116
‐ I really did
have a good time.

01:55.116 --> 01:57.580
‐ Great.
Good.

01:57.580 --> 02:00.711
Maybe we can do it again
some time.

02:00.711 --> 02:04.969
It's not just academic,
my interest in you.

02:06.138 --> 02:09.144
I just needed to say that.

02:09.144 --> 02:11.524
‐ Thank you.
‐ Oh, shit.

02:11.524 --> 02:13.027
This is a lot harder
than I thought.

02:13.027 --> 02:14.237
Maybe my assistant can‐‐

02:14.237 --> 02:15.866
‐ No.
No assistant.

02:15.866 --> 02:17.703
I'd rather not get
anyone else involved.

02:17.703 --> 02:19.582
‐ Okay, no assistant.

02:19.582 --> 02:21.961
What is this, anyway?
‐ Uh, just something

02:21.961 --> 02:24.967
I found in an old box
in my mom's basement.

02:24.967 --> 02:26.721
I didn't know anyone else
with a projector

02:26.721 --> 02:28.432
or whatever it is
you need to play it.

02:28.432 --> 02:30.311
‐ Mm‐and you didn't want
anybody else

02:30.311 --> 02:31.856
to know you were watching it?
‐ It's probably just

02:31.856 --> 02:33.777
some home movie or something,
you know.

02:33.777 --> 02:35.614
I'm not expecting
to find anything.

02:35.614 --> 02:37.200
It's just that
it's my mom's private stuff,

02:37.200 --> 02:38.662
so I wanna be respectful
of that.

02:39.747 --> 02:41.543
Okay, there.

02:41.543 --> 02:42.962
I think I got it.
‐ All right, cool.

02:42.962 --> 02:45.049
‐ Okay, you ready?

02:49.809 --> 02:52.230
They were so young.

02:52.230 --> 02:54.652
- Who are they?
- Some of the originals.

02:54.652 --> 02:57.115
They climbed Huayna Picchu
with Steve.

02:57.115 --> 03:00.371
- Huh.
- That's my mom.

03:00.371 --> 03:02.960
‐ She looks like you.
She's beautiful.

03:05.757 --> 03:09.055
Dad, this is...

03:53.352 --> 03:55.106
I don't recognize that place.

03:55.106 --> 03:56.483
- ‐ Like this?
- Yes.

03:56.483 --> 03:58.905
But get on your knees.

04:04.290 --> 04:06.838
- Sitting this way hurts, Lil.
- It should.

04:06.838 --> 04:09.552
‐ Who is he talking to?
‐ A woman? I don't know.

04:09.552 --> 04:11.388
‐ It's definitely not
my mom or Felicia.

04:11.388 --> 04:12.808
Can you just pause it?
‐ Mm‐

04:12.808 --> 04:14.018
Sure, I'll try.

04:17.901 --> 04:20.991
‐ Can you just rewind it
and then...?

04:24.330 --> 04:25.667
- Like this?
- Yes.

04:25.667 --> 04:27.713
But get on your knees.

04:30.009 --> 04:31.511
‐ Sitting this way hurts, Lil.

04:31.511 --> 04:33.641
It should.
It will.

04:33.641 --> 04:36.313
Now, focus.

04:36.313 --> 04:37.900
‐ Well, whoever she is,
she's in charge.

04:37.900 --> 04:39.904
‐ Seriously.
Who could she be?

04:39.904 --> 04:43.035
Life is one long struggle
in the dark.

04:43.035 --> 04:48.671
‐ Life is one long struggle
in the dark.

04:51.594 --> 04:52.846
‐ Uh...

04:59.610 --> 05:02.031
‐ Sarah?

05:03.576 --> 05:05.622
What are you thinking?

05:07.375 --> 05:09.839
Shit.

05:09.839 --> 05:11.676
Um, I‐I have to go.

05:11.676 --> 05:13.095
‐ Okay.

05:14.807 --> 05:17.436
Everything okay?

05:17.436 --> 05:19.274
‐ Thank you.

05:40.399 --> 05:42.111
Uh, sir, can I have
your name, please?

05:42.111 --> 05:43.615
‐ Where's your father?
He should be here.

05:43.615 --> 05:45.535
‐ He's inside,
talking with the police.

05:45.535 --> 05:47.706
‐ Well, somebody needs to
tell us what's going on.

05:47.706 --> 05:49.417
‐ That's exactly what
he is going to do

05:49.417 --> 05:51.254
as soon as he's finished
talking with the police.

05:51.254 --> 05:53.091
‐ He let a Nazi onto our campus

05:53.091 --> 05:54.344
and now there's a bomb threat.

05:54.344 --> 05:57.726
I want answers.

05:57.726 --> 05:59.897
‐ Hi, can I have your name,
please?

06:02.151 --> 06:03.571
All clear.

06:03.571 --> 06:06.076
- It was a hoax.
- You sure?

06:08.121 --> 06:11.002
No bomb.

06:11.002 --> 06:14.467
Wow.

06:14.467 --> 06:16.806
All right, in the morning,
we should

06:16.806 --> 06:18.685
gather everyone
in the meeting room

06:18.685 --> 06:20.689
and I will give them
the lowdown.

06:20.689 --> 06:22.609
‐ What will you say?

06:22.609 --> 06:25.615
‐ That it's safe to go home.

06:25.615 --> 06:30.082
And if they ask you if it
has something to do with Logan?

06:30.082 --> 06:32.003
‐
I don't know.

06:32.003 --> 06:34.675
Okay, the police don't know.

06:34.675 --> 06:37.388
Hate crimes are on the rise
everywhere.

06:37.388 --> 06:40.227
‐ Don't tell them that.
‐ Why?

06:40.227 --> 06:42.315
What do you want me
to tell them?

06:42.315 --> 06:43.735
That I made
a bunch of mistakes,

06:43.735 --> 06:45.279
first by removing security?

06:45.279 --> 06:47.116
‐ No.
‐ Look, I want you to know

06:47.116 --> 06:50.039
that I still believe that
I was right about that kid.

06:50.039 --> 06:52.460
He could've been helped.
‐ Okay.

06:52.460 --> 06:54.673
Calm down.
I know that, okay?

06:54.673 --> 06:56.509
‐ Look,
The Light is supposed

06:56.509 --> 06:59.265
to guide my decisions.

06:59.265 --> 07:01.896
The Light is in my instincts.

07:01.896 --> 07:05.110
But apparently,
The Light's instincts are shit.

07:05.110 --> 07:07.031
And so
my instincts are shit.

07:07.031 --> 07:09.536
And now I have to go out there
in front of everybody‐‐

07:09.536 --> 07:12.291
in front of Sarah‐‐
and eat crow.

07:12.291 --> 07:15.130
‐ No, don't do that.

07:15.130 --> 07:17.259
Don't eat crow.

07:17.259 --> 07:19.263
Since "sorry"
won't satiate them,

07:19.263 --> 07:21.351
it won't diminish their anger.

07:21.351 --> 07:23.898
In fact, it'll make it worse.

07:23.898 --> 07:26.152
You're the prophet
who walked through fire.

07:26.152 --> 07:28.490
Go out there and be just that.

07:28.490 --> 07:31.246
The situation is now resolved.
Everyone can go home.

07:31.246 --> 07:33.125
And if someone has
a problem, guess what?

07:33.125 --> 07:35.839
The gates are still open
and they can walk the hell out.

07:37.091 --> 07:39.805
Tell them you take
your orders from The Light.

07:39.805 --> 07:42.644
And stay away from "sorry."

08:00.680 --> 08:04.020
I want to thank everyone
for coming out this morning,

08:04.020 --> 08:07.861
after what I'm sure
was a very long night

08:07.861 --> 08:11.577
for each and every one of you.

08:11.577 --> 08:15.585
I want to start this off
by saying that...

08:17.714 --> 08:19.508
I'm sorry.

08:19.508 --> 08:20.970
I truly am.

08:20.970 --> 08:22.849
I made rash decisions,

08:22.849 --> 08:26.147
ignored the ODE,
the system...

08:26.147 --> 08:29.237
and that was a mistake.

08:29.237 --> 08:31.449
I hope that all of you
at least

08:31.449 --> 08:35.039
were able to sleep
a little bit last night.

08:35.039 --> 08:38.212
I know that's unlikely,
but all through the night,

08:38.212 --> 08:40.592
I was in contact
with the police

08:40.592 --> 08:44.685
and they assured me that it is
safe to return to the compound.

08:44.685 --> 08:49.277
The threat that we received
was a hoax.

08:49.277 --> 08:52.993
Your safety
and your own sense of safety

08:52.993 --> 08:56.457
are very important to me.

08:56.457 --> 08:59.715
I hope that you believe me
when I say that.

08:59.715 --> 09:03.973
It was the wrong time
to take down our security gate.

09:03.973 --> 09:06.729
But I'm gonna make sure
to reinstate those measures

09:06.729 --> 09:08.899
as soon as possible.

09:08.899 --> 09:11.029
Now, if anyone has
any questions, I'm‐‐

09:11.029 --> 09:12.574
‐ What if something like this
happens again?

09:12.574 --> 09:14.201
‐ I truly believe
that will not happen.

09:14.201 --> 09:15.705
Does it have anything
to do with Logan?

09:15.705 --> 09:16.915
I heard he failed the ODE.

09:16.915 --> 09:18.460
‐ Look, it has nothing to do

09:18.460 --> 09:20.088
with the boy that we know of.
Okay?

09:20.088 --> 09:21.925
Are they gonna find out
who did it?

09:21.925 --> 09:24.096
Look, I asked
Officer Banks that same thing

09:24.096 --> 09:26.142
and he told me they don't...
‐ What's going on?

09:26.142 --> 09:27.979
- ‐ Bomb threat on the compound.
- Like discussing much

09:27.979 --> 09:31.027
during the investigation,
but he will keep us updated

09:31.027 --> 09:32.947
as things move forward.

09:32.947 --> 09:35.327
Please, I want to answer
any question...

09:35.327 --> 09:37.289
- ‐ Sarah?
- That anyone wants

09:37.289 --> 09:38.876
to ask, but this
has to be done orderly.

09:38.876 --> 09:40.880
‐ Cal.
Mary.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.091
Please, one at a time.

09:42.091 --> 09:43.886
What brings you back?

09:43.886 --> 09:45.556
- ‐ It was time.
- The police are not

09:45.556 --> 09:47.727
discussing the investigation
at this time.

09:47.727 --> 09:50.232
But like I said before,
I really don't believe

09:50.232 --> 09:52.152
that Logan had anything
to do with this.

09:52.152 --> 09:54.616
‐ Of course he did it!
‐ Well, I trust that the police

09:54.616 --> 09:56.244
are looking into everyone.

09:56.244 --> 09:57.914
‐ What do you think
about all this, Cal?

09:57.914 --> 10:00.335
You hear about what's going on?

10:06.139 --> 10:09.145
‐ Sounds like everyone's
had quite a scare.

10:10.313 --> 10:12.234
Now, look, it's obvious
and understandable

10:12.234 --> 10:13.486
that tensions are running high.

10:13.486 --> 10:15.073
That makes complete sense.

10:15.073 --> 10:17.286
Where've you been, Cal?

10:19.541 --> 10:21.545
‐ The wilderness.

10:23.047 --> 10:24.133
Florida.

10:25.218 --> 10:27.181
‐ I'm sorry, who are you?

10:27.181 --> 10:29.477
‐ Cal Roberts.
‐ Cal, well, this meeting

10:29.477 --> 10:31.397
is for Meyerists only,
and I think we've answered

10:31.397 --> 10:33.401
all the questions
we can for now.

10:33.401 --> 10:36.365
Buses are waiting outside and‐‐
‐ No, no, it's‐‐it's okay.

10:36.365 --> 10:39.998
Cal is an old friend of ours.

10:42.754 --> 10:46.595
‐ People can be so foolish,

10:46.595 --> 10:48.599
so misguided.

10:48.599 --> 10:52.481
But what those without
The Light try to do to us?

10:52.481 --> 10:56.364
They want to hurt us.
They want to scare us.

10:56.364 --> 10:58.994
But they can't.

10:58.994 --> 11:03.002
They can't
because of who we are.

11:03.002 --> 11:05.006
And who we are

11:05.006 --> 11:07.010
is a reflection

11:07.010 --> 11:09.641
of who we follow.

11:09.641 --> 11:14.024
And who we follow
is Eddie Lane.

11:33.313 --> 11:35.902
I‐I tried to live
outside The Light,

11:35.902 --> 11:37.739
but I heard the call.

11:37.739 --> 11:40.578
I was able to hear the call
because Eddie

11:40.578 --> 11:43.876
took down the walls
that surrounded Meyerism.

11:43.876 --> 11:47.049
He flung open the doors,
he threw open the curtains,

11:47.049 --> 11:49.470
saying to anyone
who would listen,

11:49.470 --> 11:51.600
"All are welcome.

11:51.600 --> 11:55.148
Even those who have strayed."

11:55.148 --> 11:59.156
And the bravery that took
is immense.

12:01.745 --> 12:05.544
My family heard
Eddie's call,

12:05.544 --> 12:08.550
and we dropped everything.

12:08.550 --> 12:10.930
We drove straight here.

12:10.930 --> 12:14.228
And I‐‐and we...

12:17.109 --> 12:19.531
Would like to stay.

12:21.952 --> 12:23.914
If that would be okay, Eddie.

12:32.807 --> 12:34.435
‐ Of course.

12:43.411 --> 12:45.541
‐ Who is it?

12:45.541 --> 12:47.502
‐ It's Eddie.

12:52.680 --> 12:54.934
‐
‐ Hey, man.

12:54.934 --> 12:56.187
‐ Hey.

12:57.857 --> 13:02.575
You know, um, the longer
that you are parents,

13:02.575 --> 13:04.453
the more you'll learn that

13:04.453 --> 13:08.587
teaching consequences
is critical.

13:08.587 --> 13:11.885
You cannot betray
so many people's trust,

13:11.885 --> 13:14.974
disappear, then show back up
as if nothing happened.

13:14.974 --> 13:16.477
‐ No, I'm not pretending
nothing happened.

13:16.477 --> 13:18.147
‐ To be completely honest, Cal,

13:18.147 --> 13:19.734
I don't even know
if you deserve to be

13:19.734 --> 13:22.615
let back into this community
at all.

13:22.615 --> 13:26.330
Much less be let back in
with this amnesia

13:26.330 --> 13:29.128
you wish that we all had.

13:29.128 --> 13:33.344
You will not be allowed
to enjoy the same

13:33.344 --> 13:35.683
privileged status you had
before you left.

13:35.683 --> 13:37.102
‐ I know what it looks like.

13:37.102 --> 13:38.897
But I'm sincere.

13:38.897 --> 13:41.360
All right, we tried to live
without this place.

13:41.360 --> 13:43.406
But we couldn't.

13:43.406 --> 13:45.118
‐ Yeah, it's true.
We‐‐we couldn't

13:45.118 --> 13:46.955
and we want our son
to be raised here.

13:46.955 --> 13:49.418
‐ Great.
Then you will be willing

13:49.418 --> 13:53.217
to accept the consequences.

13:53.217 --> 13:56.432
You and Mary and Forest

13:56.432 --> 13:59.021
will be assigned to Dorm Seven

13:59.021 --> 14:01.776
on the East Campus
with the Novices.

14:01.776 --> 14:05.491
And from day one,
you will be included

14:05.491 --> 14:08.749
in the work detail rotation.

14:08.749 --> 14:10.920
- From day one.
- Why?

14:10.920 --> 14:13.174
Why are you being
so vindictive?

14:13.174 --> 14:16.430
‐ I'm not being vindictive.

14:16.430 --> 14:18.560
I'm righteous.

14:18.560 --> 14:21.398
He is the one who kept score,

14:21.398 --> 14:24.279
secrets,
kept everyone in the dark.

14:24.279 --> 14:26.158
No, it's okay, Mary.

14:26.158 --> 14:29.624
‐ And speaking of
raising your son, here.

14:29.624 --> 14:32.212
Forest will need
to be Embraced.

14:32.212 --> 14:33.924
‐ What?

14:33.924 --> 14:36.053
‐ You were.
‐ I didn't have parents.

14:36.053 --> 14:37.765
- ‐ Sarah was.
- But you‐‐your children‐‐

14:37.765 --> 14:39.101
‐ Russel was.
‐ Hawk wasn't.

14:39.101 --> 14:41.230
‐ It is an act
of commitment.

14:41.230 --> 14:43.902
A gesture of humility.

14:43.902 --> 14:45.906
Submission.

14:47.702 --> 14:50.289
Those are my terms.

14:50.289 --> 14:53.421
And those are
your consequences.

15:07.032 --> 15:09.453
Yes,
but get on your knees.

15:09.453 --> 15:12.543
You found the film in
the box of clothes for Summer?

15:12.543 --> 15:14.964
‐ Yes.
And do you recognize the voice?

15:14.964 --> 15:16.926
‐ Why are you‐‐
‐ I was curious.

15:16.926 --> 15:19.724
Would you recognize that, um...
that place?

15:19.724 --> 15:24.734
Is it on our campus?
‐ I've never seen it before.

15:24.734 --> 15:27.740
‐ But the woman who's talking,
it's‐‐it's odd.

15:27.740 --> 15:29.535
It's like
she's commanding Steve.

15:29.535 --> 15:32.082
‐ What is this about, Sarah?

15:32.082 --> 15:33.794
‐ You don't know who it is?

15:33.794 --> 15:35.714
‐ You're asking me
if I recognize some voice

15:35.714 --> 15:37.802
from over 40 years ago.

15:37.802 --> 15:40.306
No.
‐ Okay, listen again.

15:40.306 --> 15:43.730
All right? It sounds like
he calls her "Lil."

15:43.730 --> 15:45.066
- Like this?
- Yes.

15:45.066 --> 15:46.903
But get on your knees.

15:46.903 --> 15:48.532
Sitting this way hurts,
Lil.

15:48.532 --> 15:51.495
‐ All right.
Did you hear that?

15:51.495 --> 15:53.750
Lil.
Did you know anyone named Lil?

15:53.750 --> 15:55.712
‐ Maybe it's Lilith.

15:55.712 --> 15:57.883
It must be Lilith.

15:57.883 --> 15:59.679
‐ Who's Lilith?
I've never heard of her.

15:59.679 --> 16:01.223
‐ That's who it has to be.

16:01.223 --> 16:02.726
Because she would talk
like that to him.

16:02.726 --> 16:04.939
‐ Who is she?
‐ I think originally,

16:04.939 --> 16:07.068
she was a patient of his.

16:07.068 --> 16:10.158
‐ Of Steve?
‐ Yeah, she was disturbed.

16:10.158 --> 16:11.953
Unwell.

16:11.953 --> 16:13.122
She was in love with him.

16:13.122 --> 16:15.001
She was obsessed, really.

16:15.001 --> 16:18.967
All I remember is,
the last time that she visited,

16:18.967 --> 16:21.430
it was sometime
in the late '80s.

16:21.430 --> 16:24.729
She was erratic and angry.

16:24.729 --> 16:28.485
And she made some
crazy claims about Steve.

16:28.485 --> 16:31.074
‐ Well,
what kind of crazy claims?

16:31.074 --> 16:34.164
‐ I can't remember.
They're just crazy.

16:34.164 --> 16:37.337
It happens, you know,
just like Eddie

16:37.337 --> 16:39.967
got called a cult leader
on a billboard last month.

16:39.967 --> 16:41.638
Why don't you ask your dad
when he gets back?

16:41.638 --> 16:44.769
He has a much better memory.

16:44.769 --> 16:47.775
I think I'll make hlelem
tonight.

16:54.747 --> 16:56.751
‐ Come in.

16:59.464 --> 17:01.761
‐ I need to talk to you.

17:01.761 --> 17:03.890
‐ Look, Nicole,
I know you're upset.

17:03.890 --> 17:06.771
Okay, you've made that clear
and I understand.

17:06.771 --> 17:08.525
‐ I know you do.

17:08.525 --> 17:11.864
You know what
the end looks like.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.576
Look, I'm not here about Logan.

17:13.576 --> 17:16.164
I am here about the end.

17:16.164 --> 17:18.002
The end of a marriage.

17:18.002 --> 17:20.715
Russel gets back
from Peru next month

17:20.715 --> 17:24.807
and I think when he does,
I want us to...

17:24.807 --> 17:27.270
end.

17:27.270 --> 17:30.067
‐ All right.
When he gets back,

17:30.067 --> 17:32.238
- we will sit down.
- You don't understand.

17:32.238 --> 17:35.996
It's been hell
since I unburdened my affair

17:35.996 --> 17:37.833
with Sam Field.

17:37.833 --> 17:39.587
And Russel acts polite,
says all the right things,

17:39.587 --> 17:41.841
but he hates me.

17:43.385 --> 17:45.641
Hates me.

17:46.726 --> 17:49.397
And I thought
I could live with it

17:49.397 --> 17:51.026
or I had no choice
because of the kids,

17:51.026 --> 17:54.282
but now that he's been away,

17:54.282 --> 17:56.537
I see I can do it.

17:56.537 --> 17:59.209
I will be able to get by
without him.

17:59.209 --> 18:00.837
‐ Nicole,

18:00.837 --> 18:03.384
you two have been together
for 20 years.

18:03.384 --> 18:04.970
‐ And now I'm done.
‐ All right, look,

18:04.970 --> 18:06.933
I don't feel comfortable
talking about this

18:06.933 --> 18:08.561
without Russel being here.

18:08.561 --> 18:09.897
All right, this is something
the two of you

18:09.897 --> 18:12.026
would need to decide together.

18:12.026 --> 18:16.159
‐ I've decided I'm going to let
him know when he comes home.

18:16.159 --> 18:17.495
‐ Well, if you've decided,

18:17.495 --> 18:20.084
then what are you doing here?

18:20.084 --> 18:21.838
‐ Because you're The Guardian.

18:21.838 --> 18:24.384
I tell you and then
you give me your blessing.

18:24.384 --> 18:28.058
Or advise me otherwise,
or punish me.

18:28.058 --> 18:30.229
No, we don't‐‐we don't have
punishment anymore.

18:30.229 --> 18:32.442
Oh, I...

18:32.442 --> 18:35.448
I know marriage is the
cornerstone of The Movement.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.953
‐ Nicole, I'm not gonna be
doing any of those things.

18:37.953 --> 18:39.038
‐ That's what Steve did.

18:39.038 --> 18:41.794
‐ I'm not Steve.

18:43.464 --> 18:48.725
‐ But I will pray on this
for you.

18:48.725 --> 18:52.356
‐ I don't just want
your prayers, Eddie.

18:52.356 --> 18:55.362
I want you to tell me
what to do.

19:14.610 --> 19:16.488
‐ I'm not living
in Dorm Seven.

19:16.488 --> 19:19.494
All right, we are not
living in Dorm Seven.

19:19.494 --> 19:21.999
And why the hell does Forest
need to be Embraced?

19:21.999 --> 19:23.670
You're the only father
that he needs.

19:23.670 --> 19:25.297
Yeah, I'm the only father
he'll ever have.

19:25.297 --> 19:27.510
But, uh, it won't come to that.

19:27.510 --> 19:29.849
‐ Really? 'Cause Eddied
seemed dead set to me.

19:29.849 --> 19:32.144
- ‐ Yeah, well, I have a plan.
- Talk to Vera?

19:32.144 --> 19:34.274
What's she gonna do?
And who is she, anyway?

19:34.274 --> 19:35.735
‐ Well, Eddie listens to her.

19:35.735 --> 19:37.739
She's important, apparently.

19:37.739 --> 19:39.743
‐ More important than Sarah?

19:39.743 --> 19:41.998
Nope.
Oh‐‐oh, yeah.

19:41.998 --> 19:44.377
I‐‐you know, I don't know.
Um...

19:44.377 --> 19:46.966
I don't think Sarah has much to
do with Eddie these days.

19:46.966 --> 19:50.014
‐ How do you know?
‐ I don't.

19:50.014 --> 19:51.851
‐ You two seemed awfully happy
to see each other.

19:51.851 --> 19:53.897
I mean, for people
that hate each other's guts,

19:53.897 --> 19:56.192
you were all smiley‐smiley.

19:56.192 --> 19:57.821
I guess you worked out a lot
when she came down

19:57.821 --> 19:59.909
with that
cease and desist letter.

19:59.909 --> 20:01.579
‐ We did.

20:01.579 --> 20:03.206
‐ Or have you seen her
other times?

20:03.206 --> 20:05.085
I mean, did you
keep in touch with her?

20:05.085 --> 20:07.089
‐ What?
No‐‐Mary, what is this?

20:07.089 --> 20:09.595
Did you see her when
you went with Harold to Boston?

20:11.181 --> 20:12.893
I'm not gonna talk
about this anymore.

20:12.893 --> 20:15.272
‐ Because you came back
from that trip strange

20:15.272 --> 20:17.109
and that's when
you told me about Steve

20:17.109 --> 20:18.195
and that's when
all this started,

20:18.195 --> 20:19.447
the wanting to come back.

20:19.447 --> 20:20.825
‐ You know, I‐I am with you.

20:20.825 --> 20:24.290
I have a plan for us.

20:24.290 --> 20:26.837
I know what to do now.
All right?

20:26.837 --> 20:29.133
But you have to trust me.

20:44.707 --> 20:47.546
‐ Hey.
How you feeling?

20:49.382 --> 20:51.344
No one's ever really, like,

20:51.344 --> 20:53.891
kicked somebody's ass
for me before.

20:53.891 --> 20:58.233
‐ You mean gotten
their ass kicked for you.

20:58.233 --> 21:02.659
But you're welcome.
‐ Yeah.

21:02.659 --> 21:04.955
Is everything okay
with the bomb threat?

21:04.955 --> 21:07.084
‐ It was just a hoax.

21:07.084 --> 21:09.172
Yeah, how are the Musa kids?

21:09.172 --> 21:11.426
‐ Oh, um...
got some worried parents.

21:11.426 --> 21:14.975
But, uh,
I'm smoothing things out.

21:16.186 --> 21:19.358
Hopefully.
‐ Yeah.

22:09.167 --> 22:10.837
But it was so bright.

22:10.837 --> 22:14.385
It was one of those
crisp, clear, bright days

22:14.385 --> 22:16.222
that belied the fact
that it's cold as hell.

22:16.222 --> 22:18.686
It was, it was cold as hell.

22:18.686 --> 22:22.819
And, uh, we were going to
the hardware store

22:22.819 --> 22:24.823
in that old Army jeep
they used to have.

22:24.823 --> 22:26.702
It didn't even
have real windows.

22:26.702 --> 22:29.917
But the heater actually worked
pretty well.

22:29.917 --> 22:32.087
I remember very
distinctly us talking about

22:32.087 --> 22:34.217
how toasty we were in there.

22:36.179 --> 22:39.185
"Toasty."
Yeah, that was a Steve word.

22:39.185 --> 22:40.980
‐ Sorry, where's this going?

22:40.980 --> 22:42.567
‐ Oh, there's a point.
‐ Can we get to it?

22:42.567 --> 22:45.949
Because I'm really busy and...

22:45.949 --> 22:48.829
and Eddie, whatever he told you
the conditions were,

22:48.829 --> 22:50.415
those are the conditions.

22:50.415 --> 22:53.255
He's in charge
and I can't change that.

22:53.255 --> 22:56.762
‐ Anyway, a couple of minutes
down the road, we saw a man.

22:56.762 --> 22:58.849
A middle‐aged man
up ahead on the road,

22:58.849 --> 23:00.060
walking on the shoulder.

23:00.060 --> 23:02.106
A hat on, all bundled up.

23:02.106 --> 23:04.318
But he‐‐he was freezing
his ass off.

23:04.318 --> 23:05.530
I mean, how could he not be?

23:05.530 --> 23:07.534
It was nine degrees outside.

23:07.534 --> 23:10.873
Um, he didn't look up at us
when we passed him.

23:10.873 --> 23:12.877
He was just going
where he was going.

23:12.877 --> 23:15.842
But then Steve slowed down,
pulled over,

23:15.842 --> 23:18.054
and‐‐and asked him
if he needed a lift.

23:18.054 --> 23:20.392
So‐‐so Steve told me
to climb into the back,

23:20.392 --> 23:22.772
the man got in,
and off we went.

23:22.772 --> 23:24.735
He was on his way to work
and he...

23:24.735 --> 23:26.362
Kept his hands

23:26.362 --> 23:28.534
in front of the heater vents
the entire time.

23:28.534 --> 23:30.538
And they‐‐they made small talk,

23:30.538 --> 23:32.584
but not much was said.

23:32.584 --> 23:34.420
And when we got
to his restaurant,

23:34.420 --> 23:37.635
he was incredibly gracious
and thankful.

23:37.635 --> 23:39.681
And Steve said it was
no trouble, you know,

23:39.681 --> 23:41.351
happy we could help,
that sort of thing.

23:41.351 --> 23:45.651
And we drove off
feeling good about ourselves.

23:45.651 --> 23:48.490
At least,
I felt good about ourselves.

23:48.490 --> 23:51.872
And‐‐well,
not five minutes later‐‐

23:51.872 --> 23:54.210
‐ Okay, Mr. Roberts, I‐I have
to ask you to wrap it up.

23:54.210 --> 23:56.590
‐ Yeah, we're almost there.

23:56.590 --> 23:58.259
So, uh...

23:58.259 --> 24:00.222
About five minutes later,

24:00.222 --> 24:02.351
we start hearing this, uh,

24:02.351 --> 24:03.938
yeah, ca‐thunk, ca‐thunk,
ca‐thunk, ca‐thunk.

24:03.938 --> 24:05.148
And then...

24:05.148 --> 24:06.610
The engine dies completely.

24:06.610 --> 24:07.987
We can coast
to the side of the road,

24:07.987 --> 24:09.533
but the jeep's dead.

24:09.533 --> 24:11.912
It's just dead.

24:11.912 --> 24:14.083
Never to be resurrected.

24:14.083 --> 24:15.711
And‐‐and wouldn't you know it,

24:15.711 --> 24:18.466
now we're the ones
bundled up,

24:18.466 --> 24:20.721
hands in pockets,
freezing our asses off,

24:20.721 --> 24:22.474
walking on the side
of the road‐‐

24:22.474 --> 24:24.145
‐ This is a very sweet tale,
but it's really long

24:24.145 --> 24:25.940
and I have a life
that's getting short.

24:25.940 --> 24:28.236
‐ And Steve's got
a great attitude about it,

24:28.236 --> 24:29.739
but I'm less cheery.

24:29.739 --> 24:31.952
Now I'm ten.
I'm kinda pouty.

24:31.952 --> 24:35.083
But after about,
I don't know, five minutes,

24:35.083 --> 24:38.173
literally, the very first car
that passes

24:38.173 --> 24:41.220
pulls over and asks
if we need a lift.

24:41.220 --> 24:45.061
It was a nice, older woman
in a white Mercedes.

24:45.061 --> 24:47.567
Steve sat up front
with her

24:47.567 --> 24:50.948
and, uh, small talked a little
bit as she drove us home.

24:50.948 --> 24:56.417
But never saying one thing
about the roles being reversed.

24:56.417 --> 25:00.383
You know, ten minutes earlier,
not one word.

25:00.383 --> 25:03.389
I remember her making
some reference to me

25:03.389 --> 25:05.520
as Steve's son.

25:05.520 --> 25:07.481
And‐‐and him
not correcting her.

25:07.481 --> 25:09.903
Which...

25:09.903 --> 25:12.700
at the time,
that made me feel good.

25:12.700 --> 25:16.415
But then she dropped us off
back at the compound.

25:16.415 --> 25:19.255
And we were incredibly
gracious and thankful.

25:19.255 --> 25:22.010
And she said it was no problem,
and we said our good‐byes.

25:22.010 --> 25:25.016
And she drove off feeling good
about herself, I'm sure.

25:25.016 --> 25:26.352
‐ I don't‐‐I don't get it.

25:26.352 --> 25:27.396
Just help me here.

25:27.396 --> 25:30.068
‐ Who would?

25:30.068 --> 25:34.159
I did ask him,
later that night,

25:34.159 --> 25:35.663
you know, when we were
in our sleeping bag.

25:35.663 --> 25:39.963
And he said that
that was our experience,

25:39.963 --> 25:42.050
shared with that man‐‐
just the three of us‐‐

25:42.050 --> 25:43.971
‐ Wait, wait.
Did you‐‐

25:43.971 --> 25:47.604
did you just say, "When we were
in our sleeping bag?"

25:51.945 --> 25:53.489
‐ I did.

25:53.489 --> 25:55.243
‐ So you‐‐
you're trying to tell me‐‐

25:55.243 --> 25:59.251
‐ That Steve was
an exceptional man.

26:02.257 --> 26:05.848
Who‐‐he‐‐who taught me
many, many things.

26:10.273 --> 26:13.321
And we‐‐we also...

26:13.321 --> 26:16.912
often, uh...

26:16.912 --> 26:20.251
slept in the same sleeping bag,
yeah.

26:20.251 --> 26:23.341
Till I was about, uh...

26:25.763 --> 26:29.521
‐ You're accusing Steven Meyer
of molesting you?

26:29.521 --> 26:32.109
‐ Accusing?

26:33.779 --> 26:35.407
Molesting?

26:37.704 --> 26:42.170
Neither of those words
feel quite right.

26:42.170 --> 26:43.924
But, uh, yeah.

26:46.847 --> 26:50.311
‐ You're fucking lying.

26:50.311 --> 26:53.401
You're just trying to blackmail
me with your lies, all right?

26:53.401 --> 26:55.321
‐ No, I visited Steve
when‐‐when he was sick.

26:55.321 --> 26:58.244
And he‐‐he insisted on
giving me

26:58.244 --> 27:01.543
a box of letters that we wrote
to each other over the years.

27:01.543 --> 27:03.547
But I‐I didn't‐‐um...

27:05.091 --> 27:10.226
No, I couldn't look through it
until recently.

27:34.066 --> 27:36.111
I didn't go to Eddie
with any of this

27:36.111 --> 27:37.907
because he's a good soul.

27:37.907 --> 27:39.661
And he did the right thing.

27:39.661 --> 27:42.165
You know, not bury this
like everyone else

27:42.165 --> 27:43.627
in his position would.

27:43.627 --> 27:45.923
Oh, no, no, no, not him.

27:45.923 --> 27:48.804
No, he'd, uh...
he'd hang a lantern on it.

27:48.804 --> 27:52.645
He'd take this tragic situation
out of the shadows

27:52.645 --> 27:54.106
and into the light.

27:54.106 --> 27:56.653
That would, of course,

27:56.653 --> 27:59.617
absolutely destroy
The Movement.

27:59.617 --> 28:01.663
Forever.

28:01.663 --> 28:03.834
You know that.

28:03.834 --> 28:07.173
Catholics can figure out a way
to justify

28:07.173 --> 28:08.885
some priests being pedophiles‐‐

28:08.885 --> 28:11.098
which is pathetic and horrible
and whatever‐‐

28:11.098 --> 28:15.440
but if Jesus himself
was proven

28:15.440 --> 28:18.739
to be that breed of monster...

28:18.739 --> 28:21.035
uh...

28:21.035 --> 28:23.874
it'd probably be
a deal breaker.

28:31.931 --> 28:33.560
‐ What do you want?

28:33.560 --> 28:35.939
‐ I want what I had.

28:35.939 --> 28:39.989
He can be the‐‐the‐‐
the good Jesus.

28:39.989 --> 28:42.828
I just wanna be the CEO.

28:42.828 --> 28:46.670
I wanna be out in front,
speaking for The Movement.

28:46.670 --> 28:49.216
‐ Well, I don't know
how to make that happen.

28:51.680 --> 28:54.101
‐ I don't know either.

29:02.242 --> 29:04.246
‐ Why?

29:06.208 --> 29:08.254
Why would you want to be here

29:08.254 --> 29:11.510
if that horrible stuff
happened to you?

29:11.510 --> 29:13.724
‐ Because...

29:13.724 --> 29:16.688
it's cold out there, Vera.

29:18.817 --> 29:21.740
It's toasty in the light.

30:10.838 --> 30:12.716
Hey.

30:12.716 --> 30:14.637
Cal went to Boston last month.

30:14.637 --> 30:17.768
Did you two see each other?

30:17.768 --> 30:19.647
‐ Do you wanna sit down?
‐ No.

30:19.647 --> 30:22.110
No, I just‐‐
I wanna know what's going on

30:22.110 --> 30:23.530
between the two of you,
because he came back

30:23.530 --> 30:25.199
from that trip shattered.

30:25.199 --> 30:27.078
You know, it turned up
a lot of bad things.

30:27.078 --> 30:31.671
Things from his past that
you wouldn't know about and‐‐

30:31.671 --> 30:34.886
I just wanna know if you still
have feelings for him.

30:38.267 --> 30:40.313
‐ No.

30:40.313 --> 30:43.570
‐ Then why would he come back
if it wasn't for you?

30:43.570 --> 30:46.618
‐ I've been wanting to ask you
the same thing, Mary.

30:46.618 --> 30:48.955
Why did he bring
all of you back here?

30:48.955 --> 30:51.544
Whatever you think exists
between me and Cal,

30:51.544 --> 30:52.963
it's not real.

30:52.963 --> 30:55.969
There's nothing there.

30:55.969 --> 30:59.142
He didn't come back for me
or for you.

30:59.142 --> 31:02.357
He came back for himself, okay?

31:02.357 --> 31:04.486
Don't forget,

31:04.486 --> 31:06.699
whatever Cal does,

31:06.699 --> 31:08.703
he does for Cal.

31:32.166 --> 31:35.006
Musa's moved
all their stuff out.

31:36.508 --> 31:38.972
Should I not have said
Gandhi was cooler than Jesus?

31:38.972 --> 31:42.186
It was supposed to
be a joke.

31:42.186 --> 31:47.238
‐ Um, no, I'm sure there's some
other explanation, Joy.

31:47.238 --> 31:48.700
It probably has nothing
to do with you.

31:48.700 --> 31:51.079
‐ Nothing to do with me?

31:51.079 --> 31:53.000
Thanks, Hawk.

31:53.000 --> 31:56.131
Then why isn't he answering
any of my texts?

31:56.131 --> 31:58.887
‐ Um, I don't know.

31:58.887 --> 32:01.642
‐ Well, he hasn't reached out
to you at all, has he?

32:01.642 --> 32:04.523
‐ Uh...

32:04.523 --> 32:06.527
no.

32:19.260 --> 32:21.766
‐ Cal's good at doing
all the parts of the job

32:21.766 --> 32:23.268
that you don't wanna do.

32:23.268 --> 32:25.481
He can make
this entire experience

32:25.481 --> 32:27.401
so much better for you‐‐easier.

32:27.401 --> 32:28.988
Then you can just put
your focus

32:28.988 --> 32:30.992
exactly where you wanna put it,
Eddie.

32:30.992 --> 32:33.413
‐ Right,
so you have the opposite

32:33.413 --> 32:36.044
point of view as Felicia.

32:37.589 --> 32:40.887
‐ Look,
this isn't an ideal situation‐‐

32:40.887 --> 32:43.601
that's obvious‐‐
but the community

32:43.601 --> 32:45.605
is fractured at the moment,
clearly.

32:45.605 --> 32:48.987
‐ Mm.
‐ And welcoming Cal back

32:48.987 --> 32:53.580
will help the community heal,
prodigal son and all.

32:53.580 --> 32:56.544
If you take punitive action
against him and his family

32:56.544 --> 32:58.923
and his baby and put them
in the dorm with the others

32:58.923 --> 33:00.886
just to humiliate him,

33:00.886 --> 33:02.931
you will look weak
and petty.

33:02.931 --> 33:05.352
Now, it's unfortunate, yes,
that Cal made a show of us

33:05.352 --> 33:09.277
coming back,
but people liked what he said.

33:09.277 --> 33:11.239
‐ Mm.
‐ They needed it.

33:11.239 --> 33:13.870
He‐‐he was just...

33:17.168 --> 33:19.005
He was Steve's protégé, right?

33:19.005 --> 33:20.675
Like, some kind of
heir apparent?

33:20.675 --> 33:22.511
‐ I guess.

33:22.511 --> 33:27.522
And he fucked it up.
‐ Cal is a snake, Vera.

33:27.522 --> 33:30.319
He's a liar.
‐ So am I.

33:30.319 --> 33:32.783
Which means I can protect you

33:32.783 --> 33:34.494
from his
less‐than‐useful trait.

33:34.494 --> 33:36.331
- ‐
- You are the one.

33:36.331 --> 33:39.212
You have the thing, Eddie.
‐ It is not about that.

33:39.212 --> 33:40.882
‐ It's always about that.

33:40.882 --> 33:43.262
You have what it is
that he wants.

33:43.262 --> 33:46.309
And he can't take that from you
because it is you‐‐

33:46.309 --> 33:48.690
‐ Look, he fucked my wife.

33:48.690 --> 33:51.278
My ex‐wife.

33:55.662 --> 33:57.958
‐ Um...

33:59.377 --> 34:01.381
I'm sorry.

34:03.678 --> 34:07.644
I didn't know that.

34:07.644 --> 34:12.194
I think Cal
is good for Meyerism.

34:12.194 --> 34:14.282
But I had no idea
things were this personal

34:14.282 --> 34:15.577
between the two of you.

34:15.577 --> 34:18.206
And if you don't
want him around,

34:18.206 --> 34:22.505
I understand.
I'll‐‐I'll back off.

34:22.505 --> 34:24.803
But if there's any way‐‐

34:24.803 --> 34:28.393
if there's any way you can put
that history behind you,

34:28.393 --> 34:30.481
then...

34:30.481 --> 34:32.902
then just let me know.

34:32.902 --> 34:34.614
Okay?

34:41.629 --> 34:43.925
‐ You're not a snake,
by the way.

34:46.847 --> 34:51.313
‐ I‐I come from bad stock.

34:51.313 --> 34:54.780
If you come from monsters,
does that make us monsters?

34:57.786 --> 34:59.581
‐ No.

34:59.581 --> 35:01.459
‐ No?

35:01.459 --> 35:05.677
‐ Look, we make ourselves
who we are.

35:05.677 --> 35:08.725
We decide.

35:08.725 --> 35:12.774
Just like you decided
to be a good person.

35:14.695 --> 35:19.162
Somehow,
that much I'm sure about.

36:06.464 --> 36:08.468
‐ Let's see, Felicity.

36:16.317 --> 36:18.698
Best and final.

36:23.916 --> 36:25.795
I hate babies.

36:25.795 --> 36:28.300
So you can leave and
take the baby or you can stay

36:28.300 --> 36:30.512
and the baby leaves alone.

36:30.512 --> 36:34.270
Either way, baby has to go.

36:52.599 --> 36:55.228
‐ Did you get drafted
or did you enlist?

36:57.901 --> 37:00.197
By your dad, I mean.

37:02.744 --> 37:05.499
‐ I volunteered.

37:10.551 --> 37:12.597
‐ It's good to see you, Hawk.

37:22.784 --> 37:24.997
‐ You can get out here.

37:32.846 --> 37:35.685
‐ I know you've been pulled
in a lot of directions

37:35.685 --> 37:39.066
between your mom,
your dad, and me,

37:39.066 --> 37:43.199
but, uh, one day‐‐
soon, I'm sure‐‐

37:43.199 --> 37:46.665
you'll be your own man.

37:46.665 --> 37:49.170
And I very much look forward
to meeting that man.

38:35.428 --> 38:38.434
‐ To the truth.

39:21.312 --> 39:24.109
Hey.
‐ Yeah, thank you so much.

39:24.109 --> 39:26.740
- I really appreciate this.
- Yeah, sure.

39:26.740 --> 39:29.286
I can't stay long, though.
I've gotta pick up my kids.

39:29.286 --> 39:32.042
‐ It's all right, it's just
that I can see it

39:32.042 --> 39:34.965
so much better from the film
than I can on my phone.

39:34.965 --> 39:37.637
Okay, sure.
I understand.

39:37.637 --> 39:39.390
It's funny, actually.

39:39.390 --> 39:42.939
I think that
my ex‐wife has a date.

39:42.939 --> 39:45.235
‐ Huh.
That's hard.

39:45.235 --> 39:47.740
‐ Heh, yeah,
I guess it is hard.

39:47.740 --> 39:51.455
But it's great, too.
I mean, I‐‐

39:51.455 --> 39:53.042
at least I hope it's great.

39:53.042 --> 39:57.509
It's‐‐it is very hard
to move forward

39:57.509 --> 40:00.599
when‐‐when one partner hasn't

40:00.599 --> 40:02.477
and the other one has.

40:02.477 --> 40:04.816
And you are not interested
in a word that I'm saying.

40:04.816 --> 40:06.528
‐ No, uh, I am.

40:06.528 --> 40:08.615
It's just that something
came to me today.

40:08.615 --> 40:10.953
So I'm...

40:10.953 --> 40:12.039
I thought of something.
I'm feeling

40:12.039 --> 40:14.043
a little distracted.

40:15.755 --> 40:17.800
‐ Okay.
There you go.

40:17.800 --> 40:19.386
I'm an expert at this now.

40:21.265 --> 40:25.231
Um, can you move it forward
to the part where, uh,

40:25.231 --> 40:27.653
Steve was in the cave
with the ropes?

40:27.653 --> 40:28.989
‐ Yeah.

40:30.701 --> 40:33.791
Sarah,
I don't know you very well.

40:33.791 --> 40:36.253
But if you choose to‐‐
if you want to

40:36.253 --> 40:37.924
let me in to what
you're looking for,

40:37.924 --> 40:41.180
what you're going through, I‐‐
‐ Thank you.

40:44.979 --> 40:46.650
‐ I've done what you're doing
now and it's terrifying

40:46.650 --> 40:48.194
to go through it alone.

40:48.194 --> 40:49.446
- Like this?
- Yes.

40:49.446 --> 40:51.868
But get on your knees.

40:55.584 --> 40:58.423
‐ There.
Pause it.

41:04.268 --> 41:06.439
What is it?

41:08.777 --> 41:12.284
‐ He had inappropriate urges.

41:12.284 --> 41:15.290
He was...

41:15.290 --> 41:18.504
trying to choke them
from his consciousness.

41:22.847 --> 41:25.268
What if, um...

41:27.355 --> 41:30.821
What if all of this was built

41:30.821 --> 41:35.163
on the cravings
of a very sick man?

42:00.421 --> 42:02.927
Hey, can I talk to you?

42:02.927 --> 42:06.225
‐ Look,
now's not a good time, Hawk.

42:06.225 --> 42:07.979
What do you want?

42:07.979 --> 42:11.528
‐ Right now, with the fight
and the bomb scare

42:11.528 --> 42:13.406
and everything,
but I just wanted

42:13.406 --> 42:15.953
to speak to you about‐‐
‐ I can't.

42:15.953 --> 42:18.374
I can't.

42:18.374 --> 42:20.086
Look, I said good‐bye to you.

42:20.086 --> 42:22.299
You should probably go.

42:22.299 --> 42:23.969
Now.

42:26.265 --> 42:28.812
‐ Can we‐‐can we talk
somewhere privately?

42:28.812 --> 42:31.442
‐ There's no earthly reason why
we need privacy right now.

42:31.442 --> 42:33.655
Just say whatever
you came to say.

42:36.786 --> 42:40.084
I, um‐‐look,
I have a lot of work to do.

42:40.084 --> 42:42.923
I'm giving a youth homily
on Sunday.

42:45.804 --> 42:47.933
‐ You were a real asshole
to Joy.

42:47.933 --> 42:49.604
You know that?

42:49.604 --> 42:51.190
You shouldn't just
ghost people like that.

42:51.190 --> 42:53.528
It's a shitty thing to do.

42:53.528 --> 42:56.450
She didn't deserve that.

43:52.270 --> 43:54.274
You took everything!

43:54.274 --> 43:57.280
You fucked her!

43:57.280 --> 43:58.491
I was the son!

45:34.558 --> 45:37.021
To stay or to go

45:37.021 --> 45:40.027
amounts to the same thing.

45:40.027 --> 45:42.281
‐ Steve?

45:42.281 --> 45:45.622
‐ Do not listen to that man.

45:45.622 --> 45:46.791
‐ Who?

45:46.791 --> 45:49.797
‐ Do not listen to Steve.

45:49.797 --> 45:52.970
You are the true light,
not him.

45:52.970 --> 45:55.307
‐ I believe you.

45:57.563 --> 46:00.443
Cal?

46:00.443 --> 46:02.196
Cal.

46:04.284 --> 46:06.121
Are you okay?

46:06.121 --> 46:08.793
‐ No, Eddie.

46:08.793 --> 46:11.048
No, I'm not okay.

47:10.124 --> 47:12.546
Who did this?

47:12.546 --> 47:15.552
Did I do this?

47:15.552 --> 47:17.639
‐ We have to keep walking.

47:47.699 --> 47:51.456
‐ Sarah.

47:51.456 --> 47:54.170
Sarah!

47:54.170 --> 47:57.886
Hey!

47:57.886 --> 48:01.017
Stop!

48:01.017 --> 48:03.188
Sarah!

48:06.152 --> 48:08.574
Try and call her.

48:08.574 --> 48:11.622
‐ Sarah!

48:11.622 --> 48:14.294
Sarah!

48:14.294 --> 48:16.214
Sarah!

48:38.508 --> 48:40.512
Hey.

48:44.813 --> 48:47.360
‐ Where are you coming from?

48:47.360 --> 48:50.407
‐ Long night.

48:50.407 --> 48:52.411
‐ Apparently.

48:54.958 --> 48:57.964
‐ So I have decided to let Cal

48:57.964 --> 49:02.264
live off campus
and speak for The Movement.

49:02.264 --> 49:04.812
But there will be
a higher price.

49:04.812 --> 49:06.356
‐ At least you've learned
not to ask

49:06.356 --> 49:09.028
for my opinion first.

49:09.028 --> 49:11.742
He has nothing to do with me.

49:23.473 --> 49:27.858
‐ I took the medicine
last night.

49:27.858 --> 49:31.699
You were there.

49:31.699 --> 49:34.746
I was on one path,

49:34.746 --> 49:38.629
and you were on
a different one,

49:38.629 --> 49:42.470
heading in
a different direction.

49:42.470 --> 49:45.309
You weren't lost.

49:45.309 --> 49:48.774
But you weren't coming back.

49:48.774 --> 49:52.657
I tried calling out to you
and...

49:52.657 --> 49:54.745
nothing.

49:57.542 --> 50:01.257
Is there something
you wanna talk about?

50:03.345 --> 50:05.390
‐ Is there something
you wanna talk about?

50:05.390 --> 50:08.523
‐ Where were you going?

50:08.523 --> 50:11.820
Where did that path lead?

50:11.820 --> 50:15.494
Sarah.

50:15.494 --> 50:18.375
Where are you going?
‐ I can't.

50:18.375 --> 50:21.924
‐ Tell me.
‐ I don't‐‐

50:21.924 --> 50:23.343
Let go of me.

50:23.343 --> 50:25.264
‐ Sarah.

50:25.264 --> 50:27.769
You just stop?

50:27.769 --> 50:31.109
Just answer me.
Where are you going?

50:31.109 --> 50:33.321
And why?

50:35.492 --> 50:37.496
Sarah.

50:55.032 --> 50:58.581
‐ We don't use
the white rooms anymore.

50:58.581 --> 51:01.920
‐ Well, I'm reinstituting them.

51:01.920 --> 51:03.214
‐ You're punishing me?

51:03.214 --> 51:05.720
‐ This is not a punishment.

51:05.720 --> 51:08.141
This is an intervention.

51:08.141 --> 51:10.187
‐ I can't be in here.
What about my kids?

51:10.187 --> 51:12.525
‐ That is what
the community is for.

51:12.525 --> 51:15.072
To take care of things
while you get the time

51:15.072 --> 51:17.952
to deal with the things
that you need to deal with.

51:17.952 --> 51:21.292
Before walking away from
a marriage,

51:21.292 --> 51:25.342
you need to think
long and hard

51:25.342 --> 51:27.764
and silently.

51:27.764 --> 51:30.561
You need to fast and struggle.

51:30.561 --> 51:34.402
You need to rip
your fucking hair out.

51:34.402 --> 51:36.406
And then you decide

51:36.406 --> 51:40.414
if you really want to walk.

51:40.414 --> 51:44.255
Because once it's over,

51:44.255 --> 51:45.925
it's over.

52:06.299 --> 52:09.305
‐ Did you get the dumplings?

52:09.305 --> 52:11.935
You are the best.

52:15.025 --> 52:20.035
‐ Did you know that my father
preyed on little boys?

52:20.035 --> 52:21.663
‐ I didn't know that.

52:21.663 --> 52:24.836
That is very sad.

52:24.836 --> 52:27.550
I tried to help him
with his urges,

52:27.550 --> 52:30.055
but he didn't tell me
what they were.

52:30.055 --> 52:31.265
How did you find out
about this?

52:31.265 --> 52:33.813
‐ Cal.
Cal Roberts.

52:33.813 --> 52:35.065
‐ I know who he is.

52:35.065 --> 52:38.614
‐ Yeah.
Steve abused him.

52:38.614 --> 52:40.743
‐ Does Eddie know?

52:40.743 --> 52:42.246
‐ No.

52:42.246 --> 52:45.001
Cal blackmailed me.

52:45.001 --> 52:48.049
He wants a bigger audience.

52:48.049 --> 52:50.136
I help Eddie accept him
into the fold

52:50.136 --> 52:53.894
and he doesn't say a word.

52:53.894 --> 52:56.859
Everything works out
in your favor.

52:56.859 --> 52:59.154
‐ In our favor.

52:59.154 --> 53:01.910
Our favor.

53:01.910 --> 53:03.706
Okay.

53:07.129 --> 53:09.216
‐ Mom‐‐
‐ No.

53:09.216 --> 53:10.595
‐ Mom‐‐Mom‐‐
‐ Vera.

53:10.595 --> 53:13.851
‐ I want to be normal.

53:13.851 --> 53:16.732
Okay? I just want to be
a normal person

53:16.732 --> 53:18.401
I want to be
the Secular Liaison

53:18.401 --> 53:20.113
for the Meyerist Movement.

53:20.113 --> 53:22.284
And I want to be ignorant
of the signs and the end.

53:22.284 --> 53:25.332
I don't want to know these
horrible things that happen

53:25.332 --> 53:27.587
and that will happen.
‐ Nobody wants to.

53:27.587 --> 53:30.133
We live in the world
where horrible things happen,

53:30.133 --> 53:31.803
and we just do our best
to be good.

53:31.803 --> 53:34.141
‐ Eddie is good.
I'm lying to him

53:34.141 --> 53:36.605
and I don't feel good
about that.

53:36.605 --> 53:38.441
‐ He is good.

53:38.441 --> 53:41.698
And that is why
our work is so important.

53:41.698 --> 53:44.495
Eddie can spread The Light
that I encountered

53:44.495 --> 53:46.541
when I was a young girl.

53:46.541 --> 53:50.591
And that was a light
that was so‐‐so beautiful.

53:50.591 --> 53:54.641
And you‐‐you're helping him
to do that.

53:54.641 --> 53:58.106
So wash your hands,
eat something.

53:58.106 --> 54:00.110
Things will look different
in the morning.

54:37.643 --> 54:41.025
‐ You will fail.

54:41.025 --> 54:45.033
And others will fail you.

54:45.033 --> 54:50.001
Because that is
what humans do to each other.

54:50.001 --> 54:53.592
But through it all,

54:53.592 --> 54:56.514
you will have a father.

54:56.514 --> 54:59.562
A real father.

54:59.562 --> 55:02.944
Who will never fail you.

55:02.944 --> 55:06.492
And whom you can never fail.

55:06.492 --> 55:10.626
I am your spiritual father,

55:10.626 --> 55:16.345
Forest Roberts,
always and forever.

55:16.345 --> 55:18.809
I am yours

55:18.809 --> 55:22.567
and you are mine.
