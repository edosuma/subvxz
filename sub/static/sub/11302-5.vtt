[Colt screaming]

00:52.278 --> 00:53.863
What the hell was that?

00:53.947 --> 00:56.449
Sounds like Colt just discovered
I used up all the hot water.

[video game sounds continue]

02:25.622 --> 02:27.749
Please, do that some more.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.335
It's my new app.
Duck Hunter Ultra.

02:32.378 --> 02:35.339
It's got weather conditions,
tracks migratory reports.

02:35.423 --> 02:38.677
They even take pictures of the ducks
we shoot and log 'em for us.

02:38.760 --> 02:40.970
And it's got recipes.

02:41.054 --> 02:42.972
Hey, do we have tarragon?

02:44.598 --> 02:46.142
We have salt.

02:48.477 --> 02:50.354
Paper tells me everything I need.

02:50.438 --> 02:53.024
Hunting season, opens tomorrow.

02:53.107 --> 02:55.777
Sunrise, 7:12.

02:55.860 --> 02:57.278
Bring gun.

02:58.988 --> 03:00.573
I added that last part.

03:02.450 --> 03:03.617
Yeah, but can your paper do this?

03:04.118 --> 03:06.412
[quacking]

03:07.288 --> 03:08.957
Hey, that's pretty good.
Can I see that?

03:11.167 --> 03:12.668
No, you're gonna hurt it.

03:14.754 --> 03:16.339
Yes, I am.

03:18.382 --> 03:21.177
Dude, you used all the hot water.

03:21.260 --> 03:23.888
I don't know, man. I just woke up,
took my normal shower.

03:23.972 --> 03:25.681
I mean, I stayed in there a little longer

03:25.765 --> 03:27.058
'cause it was hard
to wake up this morning.

03:27.141 --> 03:28.392
Yeah, you know what'll
wake you up in the morning?

03:28.476 --> 03:30.228
A freezing cold shower.

03:30.311 --> 03:32.271
I ain't gonna find my dick till tomorrow.

03:37.443 --> 03:39.362
Certainly can't help you with that one.
But...

03:41.239 --> 03:42.531
...you know what wakes me up? [exhales]

03:42.615 --> 03:44.325
A nice hot cup of coffee.
Oh, we're out, by the way.

03:44.408 --> 03:45.618
[groans]

03:46.369 --> 03:49.663
All right, Dad, will you tell Rooster
he's got to be more considerate?

03:49.748 --> 03:51.499
There's three people living here now.

03:52.041 --> 03:54.460
Dad, will you tell Colt
if he would like a warm shower,

03:54.543 --> 03:56.337
he should wake up earlier in the morning.

03:56.420 --> 03:57.922
Rooster, shut up.

03:59.632 --> 04:00.800
Ha!

04:00.884 --> 04:02.802
Colt, shut up.

04:05.471 --> 04:06.890
We got a lot of work to do today,

04:06.973 --> 04:09.183
if we're gonna take the day off
to go hunting tomorrow.

04:10.226 --> 04:11.728
Oh, tomorrow's opening day?

04:11.811 --> 04:14.022
Yep. Just like my birthday.

04:14.105 --> 04:15.732
Only Dad knows when it is.

04:16.858 --> 04:18.233
Sweet.

04:19.152 --> 04:20.779
Yeah, I'm down to go huntin'.

04:20.862 --> 04:24.073
Really? I didn't figure
you had any interest.

04:24.157 --> 04:25.616
What? I love hunting.

04:25.699 --> 04:28.995
You get to wake up at 6:00 a.m.
and start drinking, guilt-free.

04:30.621 --> 04:32.498
Pee in the woods, always a bonus.

04:33.958 --> 04:35.794
Poop in the woods, not so fun.

04:39.547 --> 04:41.715
Yeah, I mean, fall's really
the best time of the year.

04:41.800 --> 04:43.009
Got a little nip in the air.

04:43.092 --> 04:47.180
You can wear your flannel shirts,
fleece-lined gloves, possibly a scarf.

04:48.681 --> 04:52.268
We're talking about hunting,
not some fashion show.

04:52.351 --> 04:54.228
[scoffs] Please,

04:54.312 --> 04:57.523
like you didn't agonize
over that sweet denim-on-denim combo.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.903
That's true and all, but, unfortunately,

05:01.986 --> 05:04.488
the duck blind only holds two people.

05:04.572 --> 05:07.575
One. Two. Sucks to be you.

05:09.702 --> 05:13.164
Oh, come on, man,
I ain't been in 15 years.

05:13.247 --> 05:15.624
Be nice to spend some
quality time with Dad.

05:15.708 --> 05:18.252
Well, I was gonna say no, but

05:18.336 --> 05:22.131
I can tell you really wanna go, so...
fuck, no.

05:26.010 --> 05:28.972
Well, it's Dad's decision.
You don't talk for Dad.

05:29.055 --> 05:31.182
Well, actually, I do.

05:31.265 --> 05:33.351
See, that's the beauty
of not abandoning your family.

05:33.434 --> 05:35.186
Dad and I are in sync.

05:35.269 --> 05:38.272
I know what he's thinking,
I know what he's feeling.

05:38.356 --> 05:41.567
If we were chicks, we'd be having
our periods at the same time.

05:44.778 --> 05:48.616
Actually, Rooster, what do you say
I take Colt this year?

05:49.242 --> 05:51.911
What? No, come on, man!
We're period pals.

05:53.955 --> 05:56.499
It's the fair thing to do, girlfriend.

05:57.876 --> 05:59.293
You can go the next day.

06:00.544 --> 06:03.882
Next... [sighs]
the next day is not opening day.

06:03.965 --> 06:05.799
The next day is not tradition.

06:06.342 --> 06:09.470
The next day is not Beau and Rooster
sitting in the duck blind,

06:09.553 --> 06:13.557
eating peanut butter and banana sandwiches
and killing majestic woodland creatures.

06:14.683 --> 06:16.769
Look, Dad decided.
[clears throat]

06:16.852 --> 06:18.187
And, for the record,

06:18.271 --> 06:20.773
I'd have been okay
with whatever decision you made.

06:20.856 --> 06:22.191
'Cause I love you, Daddy.

06:26.237 --> 06:27.530
We're leaving at dawn.

06:28.281 --> 06:29.657
Wear your prettiest scarf.

06:32.701 --> 06:33.869
This sucks.

06:35.371 --> 06:37.373
What's the matter?
That time of the month?

06:44.130 --> 06:45.965
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, sweetie.

06:46.049 --> 06:47.425
Hey, let me ask you something.

06:47.508 --> 06:48.927
I'm your favorite son, right?

06:49.010 --> 06:50.719
Definitely in the top two.

06:53.264 --> 06:55.099
I'm not gonna pick between you and Colt.

06:55.683 --> 06:57.268
Okay, I hear that.

06:58.394 --> 07:01.189
So, let's say you got
two lawn mowers, right?

07:01.272 --> 07:04.025
Now, the older one is more dependable.

07:04.108 --> 07:06.902
It's there for you, year after year,
and it always gets the job done.

07:06.986 --> 07:11.824
And it's got a badass nickname,
like, uh, Cutter.

07:12.783 --> 07:16.870
Now, the other lawn mower,
it moved away and it didn't come back

07:16.955 --> 07:20.666
until its professional football
lawn mowing career didn't work out.

07:22.793 --> 07:23.962
Is this about hunting?

07:24.045 --> 07:25.754
Damn straight it's about hunting.

07:27.340 --> 07:31.177
And it's about R-E-S-P-E-C-T.
Colt better find out what it means to me.

07:32.428 --> 07:35.639
I mean, he thinks just 'cause he wants
something, it's automatically his.

07:35.723 --> 07:39.268
Yeah, I know what it's like
when people expect to be given things.

07:39.352 --> 07:40.728
Here's your free beer.

07:42.730 --> 07:44.857
Sarcasm noted and ignored.

07:45.899 --> 07:47.944
I'm sorry, sweetheart, you're not wrong.

07:48.027 --> 07:50.947
It's just, I think you should
cut him some slack, you know?

07:51.030 --> 07:53.449
Your brother's missed out on a lot.

07:53.532 --> 07:55.952
Yeah, he missed out on a lot of work.
A lot of work I had to do.

07:56.035 --> 07:58.704
I had dreams, you know.
I wanted to open that body shop.

07:58.787 --> 07:59.788
I remember.

07:59.872 --> 08:03.209
Rooster's Repairs.
No shirts, no shoes, no Chevys.

08:04.793 --> 08:07.421
If I never open that place,
it should at least be a Toby Keith song.

08:09.715 --> 08:11.717
Man, I gave up everything
so I could work the ranch.

08:11.800 --> 08:14.512
You know what my reward was?
Going hunting with Dad.

08:14.595 --> 08:15.804
'Cause that's our thing.

08:15.888 --> 08:19.642
No, come on. You've had lots of things
over the last 15 years.

08:19.725 --> 08:23.104
You've had ranching, hunting, bowling.

08:23.187 --> 08:26.482
The only thing that Colt and your father
share is angry conversation.

08:27.066 --> 08:30.153
Yeah, that's their thing.
I would never take that away from them.

08:33.364 --> 08:34.657
You know,

08:34.740 --> 08:37.868
there's someone else in the family
who really loves hunting.

08:39.203 --> 08:40.871
I don't wanna go hunting with my mom.

08:40.953 --> 08:44.333
Come on, it'll be fun. I'll make you
peanut butter and honey sandwiches.

08:44.417 --> 08:47.003
Banana! It's peanut butter and banana!

08:48.004 --> 08:49.755
Fine, peanut butter and banana.

08:49.838 --> 08:52.800
Look, if you're not gonna
take this serious, don't even bother.

08:54.635 --> 08:55.886
Are you in or not?

08:56.929 --> 08:58.097
Yeah, I guess.

08:59.598 --> 09:00.933
Listen up, everybody.

09:01.434 --> 09:03.936
Rooster Bennett's going hunting
with his mommy.

09:04.853 --> 09:06.272
[laughing]

09:07.565 --> 09:09.650
What are you doing, Mom?
You're embarrassing me.

09:09.733 --> 09:12.236
I know. That's our thing.

09:17.700 --> 09:19.702
Why can't you just shower at night?

09:19.785 --> 09:21.995
Not gonna do that, Colt,
and I'll tell you why.

09:22.080 --> 09:24.665
I do not currently have a problem
getting enough hot water.

09:25.708 --> 09:26.917
Why don't you shower at night?

09:27.000 --> 09:28.502
Because I...

09:29.420 --> 09:30.504
I have an issue.

09:32.423 --> 09:33.549
It's your hair, ain't it?

09:33.632 --> 09:37.053
If I go to sleep and it's damp,
I have zero volume in the morning.

09:38.512 --> 09:41.515
All those years I wanted a little sister.
Here she is.

09:45.061 --> 09:47.020
- Ma?
- Hey, Colt.

09:48.397 --> 09:50.191
Are you wearing my scarf?

09:51.067 --> 09:53.194
No. This one's Dad's.

09:54.820 --> 09:56.947
Goes with his denim leisure suit.
[chuckles]

09:59.533 --> 10:02.245
Is that my gun?
What are you doing here anyway?

10:02.328 --> 10:03.496
Opening day.

10:03.579 --> 10:05.081
Yeah. I'm going with Mom.

10:05.164 --> 10:07.291
- [chuckles] Just like junior prom.
- [gun clicks]

10:08.501 --> 10:11.462
She was not my date.
I just forgot my boutonniere, shithead.

10:12.755 --> 10:15.633
Oh, yeah, I made him dance with me.
He was mortified.

10:15.716 --> 10:16.884
That was awesome.

10:18.427 --> 10:20.638
- Hey, where's my hat?
- What hat?

10:20.721 --> 10:23.015
My favorite hat.
You know, my John Deere hat?

10:23.099 --> 10:25.101
Paint stains?
Smells like a bait shop?

10:25.184 --> 10:28.104
Yeah, I might have worn
that hat last night.

10:28.187 --> 10:30.689
What? You might have worn it
or you did wear it?

10:30.773 --> 10:32.691
Okay, I guess I did.
I don't know.

10:32.775 --> 10:34.193
Let's load the truck.

10:34.277 --> 10:37.946
Really? You're not dying to find out
what happened to the hat?

10:40.449 --> 10:42.910
I can't believe you lost my hat, man.
Where'd you go last night?

10:44.120 --> 10:46.038
Oh, I went to my buddy Will's place.

10:46.122 --> 10:47.706
Yeah, we were gonna
cruise around the local parks,

10:47.790 --> 10:49.750
see if we could find
high school kids drinking.

10:49.833 --> 10:52.085
Then pretend we're cops,
scare the crap out of them,

10:52.170 --> 10:53.546
watch them run, and steal their beers.

10:55.756 --> 10:56.965
It's pretty simple, really.

10:57.049 --> 10:59.510
I mean, all you need is a flashlight
and a deep voice.

10:59.593 --> 11:01.137
[in a deep voice]
What are you kids doing?

11:02.430 --> 11:05.057
Yeah. I know how to steal beers
from teenagers, Colt.

11:06.392 --> 11:07.393
Where's my hat?

11:08.394 --> 11:11.480
Oh, yeah. Then we realized
we needed some new beer cozies,

11:11.564 --> 11:13.316
so we went to the gas station,

11:13.399 --> 11:15.776
found these sweet ones
with girls in bikinis on them.

11:15.859 --> 11:19.112
When the cozy gets cold,
the bikinis disappear.

11:20.656 --> 11:23.201
Don't worry,
we did not lose those. [chuckles]

11:24.243 --> 11:26.412
But, here's the thing,
I know I still had the hat on

11:26.495 --> 11:30.082
'cause Mark, the clerk, he said,
"Sweet hat. You wanna buy some meth?"

11:32.918 --> 11:34.920
Then I politely declined.

11:36.214 --> 11:37.548
Then we got into Will's truck,

11:37.631 --> 11:40.509
we went and found some kids,
roused them, and then...

11:40.593 --> 11:44.137
I cracked my first beer,
then I had a few more.

11:44.222 --> 11:45.556
Man, that's where it gets a little fuzzy.

11:45.639 --> 11:49.560
I remember going through
a Dairy Queen drive-through.

11:49.643 --> 11:52.230
It was me and Will
and his dog named Raccoon...

11:54.982 --> 11:56.859
Although it might have been
an actual raccoon.

11:59.445 --> 12:02.948
All I know is, he was real excited
about that chocolate dip cone.

12:06.494 --> 12:07.995
What the hell is wrong with you?

12:09.162 --> 12:10.289
That's a fair question.

12:12.333 --> 12:14.877
- Here, you can just take my hat.
- I don't want your hat.

12:14.960 --> 12:16.420
[muffled] Fine, just grab another hat.

12:16.504 --> 12:18.506
Oh, okay. Well, which hat should I grab?

12:18.589 --> 12:21.259
My DeWalt hat?
No. That's for fishing.

12:21.342 --> 12:24.011
My Bass Pro Shops hat?
No. That's for church.

12:25.471 --> 12:28.516
My "Free Mustache Rides" hat?
No. That's for the state fair.

12:29.683 --> 12:31.685
Listen, this is kinda your fault.

12:32.270 --> 12:35.063
If I'da just had a shower,
I wouldn't've needed a hat.

12:36.940 --> 12:39.151
- You two still at it?
- We're leaving.

12:39.234 --> 12:41.320
Well, I'm not going.
I'm not going without my hat.

12:41.404 --> 12:42.530
Okay, bye.

12:49.287 --> 12:50.871
My sister is such a bitch.

12:57.586 --> 12:59.630
You know what that hat and I
have been through?

12:59.713 --> 13:01.424
I can only imagine.

13:02.591 --> 13:04.635
Learned how to drive in that hat.

13:04.718 --> 13:07.388
I went to my homecoming in that hat.

13:07.471 --> 13:10.974
I even lost my...
boyhood in that hat.

13:12.017 --> 13:13.936
You left your hat on?

13:14.019 --> 13:15.771
[sighs] It was a request.

13:16.689 --> 13:18.899
That's how awesome that hat was.

13:18.982 --> 13:20.150
It was basically a threesome.

13:20.734 --> 13:23.612
Rooster Bennett, Debbie Pearson,
John Deere.

13:24.697 --> 13:26.699
Well, I don't know
why you'd wanna cover up

13:26.782 --> 13:28.701
that beautiful head of curly hair anyway.

13:29.618 --> 13:31.119
Yeah, my hair does kick ass.

13:32.746 --> 13:34.623
But that doesn't solve my Colt problem.

13:35.541 --> 13:38.752
Guy comes back into town,
thinks about no one but himself.

13:38.836 --> 13:39.920
Same old Colt.

13:40.003 --> 13:42.297
All right, okay, I get it.

13:42.381 --> 13:46.009
Colt can be selfish at times.
That's why I'm in this blind with you.

13:46.927 --> 13:49.763
Your brother and your father
have a lot of problems.

13:49.847 --> 13:50.889
[softly] Yeah.

13:50.973 --> 13:52.391
But you and I?

13:53.308 --> 13:54.727
We're perfect.

13:57.312 --> 14:00.733
I know you're just saying that,
but it's kinda true.

14:02.526 --> 14:06.238
And if it gets to be too much,
here's a good way to deal with anger.

14:09.950 --> 14:13.036
What is that guy's problem?
I mean, it's just a hat.

14:13.120 --> 14:15.956
If he cared so much about it,
why'd he put it on the community hat rack?

14:16.039 --> 14:19.001
[scoffs] Well, I think he just wants
something to be pissed off at me about.

14:19.835 --> 14:21.879
Yeah, they're working this way, Drake.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.381
Making their way this...

14:23.464 --> 14:25.215
Oh, the ducks. Yeah.

14:25.298 --> 14:28.802
I mean, it's just... [stutters]
it's like, how's he the one who's upset?

14:28.886 --> 14:30.471
I mean, there's three of us
living there now. Right?

14:30.554 --> 14:33.641
We got to share things,
hot water and hats.

14:33.724 --> 14:35.726
Hell, the other day
he took one of my beers,

14:35.809 --> 14:36.852
you didn't see me complaining.

14:36.935 --> 14:38.521
Those were my beers.

14:38.604 --> 14:40.606
Exactly, we get it.

14:42.315 --> 14:44.067
I'm sorry he's so annoying.

14:44.151 --> 14:45.778
Yeah, thank you.

14:45.861 --> 14:47.488
I was talking to the dog.

14:49.532 --> 14:53.076
Look, don't let this hat thing
with your brother

14:53.160 --> 14:55.287
ruin opening day, all right?

14:55.371 --> 14:56.997
He's just messing with you.

14:57.080 --> 14:59.458
Yeah, I wish that's what he was doing.

14:59.542 --> 15:02.252
But that would require him actually
thinking about another human being.

15:03.086 --> 15:06.339
[Colt] Hey, Rooster, I found your hat!

15:06.424 --> 15:07.425
You did?

15:07.508 --> 15:10.553
No! I'm too busy bonding with Dad!

15:14.306 --> 15:16.892
Mom just told me you're actually adopted!

15:17.768 --> 15:19.395
Come on.

15:19.478 --> 15:21.063
Your brother really cares about you.

15:21.146 --> 15:23.231
He just doesn't know how to show it
or say it all the time.

15:23.315 --> 15:25.358
He's a lot like your father in that way.

15:25.443 --> 15:26.485
[scoffs] Yeah?

15:26.569 --> 15:29.112
Well, my father never
lost my threesome buddy.

15:30.448 --> 15:33.366
Look, all I'm saying is
you have to be patient with him.

15:33.451 --> 15:35.494
The bottom line is, he's family.

15:35.578 --> 15:36.745
[sighs]

15:36.829 --> 15:39.707
And more importantly,
it's just a fucking hat.

15:46.964 --> 15:49.257
See... [grunts]
see, that's the problem.

15:49.341 --> 15:51.594
Without the morning shower,
there's no life.

15:51.677 --> 15:54.179
There's no bounce, there's no shine.

15:56.264 --> 15:58.100
I mean, I know what you're gonna say,

15:58.183 --> 16:00.894
"It looks fine,"
but I ain't shooting for fine.

16:02.270 --> 16:04.397
You get it, silver fox.

16:05.816 --> 16:09.111
And what do you use in your hair?
Mousse or pomade?

16:09.194 --> 16:11.321
You got so much poof.
It's, like...

16:11.404 --> 16:13.406
Where are you going?

16:13.491 --> 16:16.494
See, this is why people
rarely give you compliments.

16:20.330 --> 16:23.083
Oh, look at your coat, you're gorgeous.

16:25.586 --> 16:26.962
Let's look at the big picture.

16:27.045 --> 16:28.506
As difficult as Colt can be,

16:28.589 --> 16:30.841
would you rather have your brother back
or your hat back?

16:30.924 --> 16:32.134
Hat.

16:33.802 --> 16:35.428
Get out.

16:35.513 --> 16:36.889
What? Why?

16:36.972 --> 16:38.932
'Cause I'm not sitting
with your brother anymore.

16:39.016 --> 16:40.893
Well, I'm not sitting with him either.

16:40.976 --> 16:43.311
Yes, you are.
You're the reason he's whining.

16:44.229 --> 16:46.940
The reason he's whining
is 'cause he's a big baby.

16:47.024 --> 16:48.275
I just wanna go home.

16:52.362 --> 16:54.031
And the duck says...

16:54.114 --> 16:55.783
[blows duck call]

17:00.162 --> 17:01.872
And the dog says...

17:04.791 --> 17:07.377
What's the matter, Drake,
cat got your tongue? [chuckles]

17:09.588 --> 17:10.756
Oh...

17:10.839 --> 17:13.050
- Oh, what are you doing?
- Dad sent me.

17:13.133 --> 17:16.804
[clears throat] No. No, no, no, no.
This is me and Dad's day.

17:16.887 --> 17:19.431
Well, I guess he just realized
how much he hates you.

17:19.515 --> 17:20.808
Move over.

17:20.891 --> 17:22.560
I ain't moving.

17:22.643 --> 17:25.395
For once, you're gonna do something
you don't wanna do, now move over.

17:25.478 --> 17:28.106
- Move me.
- Fine, I won't. I'll sit on you.

17:28.190 --> 17:30.693
What are you... ah!
Come on, man, you're all soaking wet.

17:30.776 --> 17:32.695
Yeah, it's mostly duck shit, too.

17:32.778 --> 17:33.862
What are you...

17:33.946 --> 17:35.656
- And I just farted on you.
- [grunts]

17:36.574 --> 17:37.866
[sighs]

17:49.002 --> 17:50.713
Did you eat my peanut butter
and banana sandwich?

17:50.796 --> 17:51.839
No.

17:51.922 --> 17:55.258
I took one bite and decided I was full
and I threw the rest out.

17:57.010 --> 17:59.137
You know what?
Don't talk to me anymore.

17:59.221 --> 18:00.931
Fine.

18:03.559 --> 18:05.143
Oh, look what I found.

18:11.650 --> 18:12.735
You know...

18:14.152 --> 18:16.822
- maybe I should've brought Rooster along.
- [sighs]

18:16.905 --> 18:18.949
He's right, it has become a tradition.

18:19.491 --> 18:22.119
You know, Colt was
really excited to be with you.

18:22.202 --> 18:24.121
Both your boys wanted
to spend time with you,

18:24.204 --> 18:26.331
and I know you don't
want to hear this but...

18:26.414 --> 18:28.917
it says something really nice about you.

18:29.542 --> 18:30.878
Huh.

18:31.461 --> 18:32.671
[imitating Beau] Huh.

18:33.171 --> 18:36.216
Why can't boys be more like cows?

18:37.593 --> 18:40.804
You could brand 'em,
stick 'em out in a field,

18:40.888 --> 18:43.599
and they just stand there
until they're ready to die.

18:45.643 --> 18:48.561
Beau? I never thought I'd say this.

18:48.646 --> 18:50.147
You talk too much.

18:51.982 --> 18:53.150
Sorry.

18:54.401 --> 18:58.030
Hey, would you say I'm a silver fox?

19:01.784 --> 19:03.326
Oh! Got 'em.

19:05.078 --> 19:06.329
Drake, fetch.

19:08.540 --> 19:10.876
Drake, fetch.

19:12.294 --> 19:13.586
Drake, fetch.

19:17.299 --> 19:19.342
Now even the dog likes you better?

19:20.302 --> 19:21.386
Of course he does.

19:21.469 --> 19:23.221
- Everyone likes me better. You know why?
- [sighs]

19:23.305 --> 19:24.765
[whispering] 'Cause I'm better.

19:27.517 --> 19:30.562
I know for a fact if it was Dad's hat,
you never would have touched it.

19:30.646 --> 19:33.649
Oh, my God, shut up about the hat!

19:33.732 --> 19:35.734
It's not just about the hat, man.

19:35.818 --> 19:38.028
It's indicative of a larger
lack of concern!

19:38.111 --> 19:39.863
- What?
- It's indicative

19:39.947 --> 19:41.990
of a larger lack of concern!

19:43.784 --> 19:46.995
I spent years earning everyone's respect.

19:47.079 --> 19:49.790
Then you show up and all of a sudden
you're the favorite again? [scoffs]

19:49.873 --> 19:50.874
How does that work?

19:50.958 --> 19:53.335
You know why I'm the favorite?
I'll tell you why.

19:53.418 --> 19:54.962
[whispering] 'Cause I'm better.

19:56.504 --> 19:58.048
You know what else you are?

19:58.131 --> 19:59.967
[whispering] You're an asshole.

20:02.761 --> 20:04.179
Fifteen years, Colt.

20:04.763 --> 20:06.974
[sniffs] I had to shovel shit,

20:07.057 --> 20:09.059
while you abandoned the family
so you could travel the world...

20:09.142 --> 20:10.268
- Okay, all right.
- ...for 15 years...

20:10.352 --> 20:12.520
Enough with
the "abandoned the family" crap.

20:12.604 --> 20:15.107
I had a chance to be a pro athlete.

20:15.190 --> 20:16.649
Who's not gonna take that?

20:16.734 --> 20:19.069
I mean, you could have followed
your stupid dream.

20:19.152 --> 20:21.113
"Rooster's Topless Tapas."

20:22.114 --> 20:24.116
- Dude, that was genius!
- [scoffs]

20:24.199 --> 20:26.534
"Big tatas, small tapas."

20:29.037 --> 20:30.831
It ain't my fault you hate your life.

20:30.914 --> 20:33.333
[scoffs] No, man, I don't hate my life.

20:33.416 --> 20:35.418
I just hate the fact you think
you can do whatever you want.

20:35.502 --> 20:37.838
- It don't work like that.
- [stutters] I left!

20:37.921 --> 20:39.506
- Okay? I left!
- Yeah!

20:39.589 --> 20:41.508
Yeah! Well, guess what.

20:41.591 --> 20:44.427
You gotta be a grown-ass man
and start taking responsibility

20:44.511 --> 20:46.096
for your own life and your own choices.

20:46.179 --> 20:48.766
You chose to stay!

20:50.475 --> 20:52.477
You know what else I choose to do?

20:53.395 --> 20:55.188
Oh, don't shoot my hat.

20:55.272 --> 20:56.356
Don't you shoot my hat.

20:59.567 --> 21:02.029
You mess with the Rooster,
you get the beak!

21:05.365 --> 21:08.701
To think there was a time
we never wanted those boys to grow up.

21:09.619 --> 21:11.538
Well, we got our wish.
[chuckles]

21:12.956 --> 21:14.374
[smacks lips]

21:15.751 --> 21:17.920
Remember the first time
we took 'em hunting?

21:19.046 --> 21:20.172
Oh, yeah.

21:20.255 --> 21:23.258
Colt wanted to use the 12 gauge
like his big brother.

21:23.759 --> 21:26.386
I told him it was too much for him,

21:26.469 --> 21:28.513
but he needed to learn for himself.

21:29.056 --> 21:30.723
Yeah, he learned all right.

21:30.808 --> 21:32.725
Duck came in, Colt fired,

21:32.810 --> 21:35.187
the recoil hit him in the face,
broke his nose.

21:35.270 --> 21:38.190
[chuckles]
Blood was everywhere.

21:38.273 --> 21:39.732
Rooster came running up,

21:39.817 --> 21:44.321
"Dad! Colt's dying, Colt's dying.
Why are you laughing?"

21:45.572 --> 21:49.659
Yeah, there's nothing funnier than
givin' a firearm to a 13-year-old

21:49.742 --> 21:51.912
and letting him figure it out for himself.

21:52.996 --> 21:55.665
Yeah. It was pretty stupid.

21:57.459 --> 21:58.460
You were right.

21:59.377 --> 22:00.462
Wow.

22:01.880 --> 22:05.383
All these years I thought
it would kill you if you said that.

22:05.467 --> 22:07.344
- [Beau chuckles]
- And yet, here you are.

22:11.598 --> 22:14.684
This is pretty nice.
We ought to hunt more often. [chuckles]

22:15.602 --> 22:20.523
Yeah, we take our aggression
out on the birds instead of each other.

22:21.774 --> 22:25.112
You know, we got an empty house.

22:25.195 --> 22:27.948
I could think of another way
to take our aggressions out.

22:28.031 --> 22:29.407
Let's go.

22:30.909 --> 22:32.953
Ah! Ah! Ah!
No hair pulling!

22:33.036 --> 22:34.079
No rules!

22:34.162 --> 22:36.123
- Ah! Fine!
- [grunts] My nuts!

22:38.541 --> 22:40.377
- [groaning and heavy exhaling]
- [car engine running]

22:40.460 --> 22:42.795
- What's that?
- [car doors opening and closing]

22:42.880 --> 22:44.047
Is that Mom and Dad?

22:44.131 --> 22:45.924
Oh, great, they're leaving.

22:46.925 --> 22:49.511
They hate you so much,
they left me behind.

22:50.888 --> 22:52.764
[Colt] Thanks, Drake.

22:52.847 --> 22:54.641
Oh, congratulations,
you actually hit something today.

22:54.724 --> 22:57.602
Yeah? That's not the only thing
I'm about to hit.

22:57.685 --> 22:58.937
[grunts]

23:01.940 --> 23:03.816
[country music playing]

23:05.652 --> 23:09.239
Mmm, this isn't the usual stuff, is it?

23:10.490 --> 23:13.576
It's something I had put away
for a special occasion.

23:14.619 --> 23:17.289
You're not getting soft
in your old age, are ya?

23:19.041 --> 23:21.709
Don't get too excited.
You only get one glass.

23:23.628 --> 23:27.632
I'm saving the rest in case we get
a surprise visit from John Elway.

23:30.593 --> 23:34.389
This turned out to be
a pretty great opening day.

23:34.472 --> 23:35.473
Yeah.

23:36.391 --> 23:38.685
Maybe this ought to be the new tradition.

23:39.227 --> 23:43.190
Send the boys hunting,
and we have the house all to ourselves.

23:43.898 --> 23:45.150
[Colt] You're a fucking idiot!

23:49.404 --> 23:50.905
Hell, I did my best.

23:51.823 --> 23:54.367
Left them both out
in the middle of nowhere with guns

23:54.451 --> 23:55.953
and they still came back.

23:57.162 --> 23:58.830
[Rooster] You could have
walked around the puddle,

23:58.913 --> 24:00.623
but you walked through it
just to splash me.

24:00.707 --> 24:03.043
What difference does it make?
We're already soaking wet.

24:03.126 --> 24:05.963
The difference is,
stop me if you've heard this before,

24:06.046 --> 24:08.048
- it's indicative of a larger...
- Oh, my God!

24:08.131 --> 24:11.301
Shut up! And suck my indicative.

24:12.760 --> 24:15.013
Don't go in there with wet clothes.

24:16.264 --> 24:17.390
We're not gonna strip.

24:17.474 --> 24:19.351
Then you're not going inside.

24:24.356 --> 24:26.816
- I'm getting the first shower.
- Hell you are.

24:31.696 --> 24:33.865
- You kidding me?
- What?

24:33.948 --> 24:35.533
Those are my fuckin' underwear.

24:40.622 --> 24:42.457
[country music playing]

24:46.878 --> 24:48.296
[Rooster] Look who showed up.

24:48.838 --> 24:51.383
Thought I was gonna do
all the work by myself.

24:51.466 --> 24:54.344
You know, like the last 15 years.

24:55.720 --> 24:58.431
Yeah. I went looking for your hat.

24:58.515 --> 24:59.557
Seriously?

25:00.392 --> 25:03.978
I got Mark at the gas station
to show me the security footage.

25:04.062 --> 25:06.814
I still had your hat on
while I was filling up the truck.

25:06.898 --> 25:08.816
Was pretending the nozzle was my dick.

25:11.319 --> 25:14.822
So I ran over to William's place,
and holy shit,

25:14.906 --> 25:18.160
if his neighbor ain't out front
working on his bike wearing your hat.

25:18.243 --> 25:19.744
- What?
- Yeah.

25:19.827 --> 25:20.995
Big dude, right?

25:21.079 --> 25:23.831
With tattoos, he had that chain
coming from his wallet.

25:23.915 --> 25:25.708
Real badass, right?

25:26.918 --> 25:29.962
So I look at the guy,
I says, "I want that hat."

25:30.047 --> 25:31.589
And he says to me,

25:32.174 --> 25:33.883
"You want this hat, you're gonna have
to come take it."

25:35.468 --> 25:37.429
So I got right up in his face

25:37.512 --> 25:39.764
and I asked him
what the capital of Thailand was

25:39.847 --> 25:42.975
and he said, "What?" and I said "Bangkok,"
then I kicked him in the nuts.

25:48.065 --> 25:50.733
[chuckling] I grabbed your hat
and I ran like a little bitch.

25:52.319 --> 25:53.320
Anyway, here.

25:55.447 --> 25:57.282
Thanks, Colt. I appreciate this.

26:00.452 --> 26:03.955
Maybe that other stuff
wasn't all your fault.

26:05.790 --> 26:07.709
It's possible I was almost an asshole.

26:10.753 --> 26:13.090
Yeah. Almost.

26:15.883 --> 26:18.303
- Just one thing though.
- Yeah?

26:18.386 --> 26:19.679
This ain't my hat.

26:24.976 --> 26:26.228
Are you serious?

26:26.311 --> 26:27.479
[inhales through teeth]
Also...

26:28.105 --> 26:30.148
there's a giant guy on a Harley
coming down the driveway.

26:31.316 --> 26:32.984
[motorcycle engine running]

26:40.450 --> 26:42.160
Oh, come on, man!

26:42.660 --> 26:44.371
[country music playing]

26:44.373 --> 26:49.373
