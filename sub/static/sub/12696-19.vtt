WEBVTT

00:08.067 --> 00:10.900
- I love relaxing
with my girlfriend.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.300
!

00:12.400 --> 00:15.133
Get your hand out your
butt and in the game!

00:15.233 --> 00:19.433
- I am one lucky guy.

00:21.300 --> 00:23.367
- Oh, it's my parents again.

00:23.467 --> 00:25.467
- You gave your parents
your real number?

00:25.567 --> 00:27.233
- They wanna know why
we're not watching the game

00:27.333 --> 00:29.300
with them at our house.

00:29.400 --> 00:31.733
Tell me the truth.
I won't be mad.

00:31.833 --> 00:33.467
Are you avoiding
meeting my parents?

00:33.567 --> 00:35.067
- Tsk. Yes.

00:35.167 --> 00:37.567
- Aha! I knew it!
You jerk!

00:37.667 --> 00:40.133
- Allison, I'm...a rebel.

00:40.233 --> 00:42.100
Whenever I'm around adults,
especially parents,

00:42.200 --> 00:43.600
I just start insulting them.

00:43.700 --> 00:46.167
- Ha! Ha! Ha! You guys
watching the hockey game?

00:46.267 --> 00:48.100
- We are, but you and your
pit stains are not invited,

00:48.200 --> 00:51.267
so back away from
the chips and move along.

00:51.367 --> 00:55.033
- We will speak later,
young man--

00:55.133 --> 00:57.300
after I change my shirt.

01:00.667 --> 01:04.567
I can't help myself.
It's a gift and a curse.

01:04.667 --> 01:06.767
I definitely can't meet
your parents tomorrow.

01:08.400 --> 01:10.067
- You don't have
a choice this time.

01:10.133 --> 01:11.267
My mom and dad want you

01:11.367 --> 01:12.600
to come to the grand
opening of their business.

01:12.700 --> 01:14.567
They said if you don't show,
I can't see you anymore.

01:16.067 --> 01:19.300
Oh, why are they
being such babies about this?

01:20.633 --> 01:22.200
- To them, no boyfriend
is good enough

01:22.300 --> 01:24.367
for their sweet,
little Alli-Walli.

01:24.467 --> 01:28.400
- Me! Dummy!

01:28.500 --> 01:31.133
Please! Don't give them
an excuse to break us up.

01:33.067 --> 01:35.567
Fine, I'll go to
their grand opening.

01:35.667 --> 01:37.533
- Great! I'm gonna
call and tell them.

01:37.633 --> 01:40.200
- MAX:

01:40.300 --> 01:42.800
There's no way
this ends well.

01:42.900 --> 01:45.900
- * Yes there is!

01:46.067 --> 01:48.167
After you smack-talk
Alli-Walli's parents,

01:48.267 --> 01:50.233
I get my best friend back.

01:50.333 --> 01:53.300
- That's not happening.
What? Ooh!

01:53.400 --> 01:55.700
- You can't be seen up here.

01:55.800 --> 01:56.967
- Bunnies before honeys!

01:57.067 --> 01:59.167
Ahhhh!

02:00.933 --> 02:02.567
- *

02:02.667 --> 02:03.800
* What you see

02:03.900 --> 02:05.467
* Is not what you get

02:05.567 --> 02:08.833
* Livin' our lives
with a secret *

02:08.933 --> 02:10.300
* We fit right in

02:10.400 --> 02:12.067
* Bet you never guessed

02:12.133 --> 02:13.300
* 'Cause we're
livin' our lives *

02:13.400 --> 02:15.267
* Just like all the rest

02:15.367 --> 02:17.167
* A picture
perfect family *

02:17.267 --> 02:18.933
* Is what we try to be

02:19.067 --> 02:20.200
* Look closer,
you might see *

02:20.300 --> 02:22.167
* The crazy things we do

02:22.267 --> 02:23.833
* This isn't
make believe *

02:23.933 --> 02:25.300
* It's our reality

02:25.400 --> 02:26.667
* Just your average family

02:26.767 --> 02:30.067
* Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble *

02:30.100 --> 02:32.767
* Livin' a double life *

02:36.867 --> 02:40.700
- *

02:40.800 --> 02:41.967
- Allison, bad news.

02:42.067 --> 02:43.300
I can't meet
your parents tomorrow.

02:43.400 --> 02:46.167
I have a--

02:46.267 --> 02:49.233
- You don't know me.

02:49.333 --> 02:50.767
- Max, you're gonna be fine.

02:50.867 --> 02:52.067
My parents are normal people.

02:52.100 --> 02:53.567
They're just a little intense.

02:53.667 --> 02:56.200
I mean, it's a miracle
I'm so laid back.

02:56.300 --> 03:00.167
Hey, this is a school,
not a half-pipe, ya half-wit!

03:01.267 --> 03:04.067
- I cannot lose her.

03:04.167 --> 03:06.267
- Oh, Mr. Cunningham,

03:06.367 --> 03:08.833
you are as wise as
you are fashionable.

03:08.933 --> 03:10.833
Phoebe.

03:10.933 --> 03:12.067
Phoebe!

03:13.700 --> 03:15.467
- Phoebe, uh,
I need some help.

03:15.567 --> 03:17.500
- Max, I'm literally in the
middle of a tour right now.

03:17.600 --> 03:19.300
- Oh, uh, I'll finish
it for you.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.067
Those are the lockers,
that's upstairs,

03:21.100 --> 03:22.800
and that's
the nurse's office.

03:22.900 --> 03:24.300
You smell sick.

03:26.300 --> 03:28.500
- I know I have a problem,
I can't talk to adults,

03:28.600 --> 03:29.900
which is why I need
you to go with me

03:30.067 --> 03:31.833
to meet Allison's
parents tomorrow.

03:31.933 --> 03:33.367
- And that would
help you how?

03:33.467 --> 03:35.700
- Easy. I'll keep quiet so
I don't say anything insulting,

03:35.800 --> 03:38.067
and you charm them with your
goody-two-shoes nonsense,

03:38.100 --> 03:41.267
and since we're twins, they'll
think I'm goody-two-shoes, too.

03:41.367 --> 03:45.533
- Max, if you are lying,
that means you're not trying.

03:45.633 --> 03:48.767
That's exactly
the nonsense I'm talking about.

03:50.267 --> 03:51.867
Please? Allison's
parents are looking

03:51.967 --> 03:53.467
for any reason
to break us up.

03:53.567 --> 03:56.067
Okay. Okay.

03:56.167 --> 03:57.267
I'll go with you.

03:57.367 --> 03:59.100
But only because
Allison single-handedly

03:59.200 --> 04:01.267
cut down your pranking
by 40 percent.

04:02.933 --> 04:05.067
Pfft! Nerd.

04:05.133 --> 04:08.733
- As for Allison's parents,
that'll be a piece of cake.

04:08.833 --> 04:10.267
Parents love me.

04:10.367 --> 04:12.867
Oh, I've even got some
killer new dad jokes.

04:12.967 --> 04:14.300
- I'm sure.

04:14.400 --> 04:16.967
- Hey, sure, I'm Phoebe.

04:17.067 --> 04:18.267
- That wasn't funny.

04:18.367 --> 04:20.133
- MR. CUNNINGHAM:

04:20.233 --> 04:22.100
This dad gets it.

04:22.200 --> 04:25.267
- *

04:25.367 --> 04:27.100
- CHLOE: Whee!

04:27.200 --> 04:28.700
- That was a great dinner.

04:28.800 --> 04:30.633
- Oh, it sure was,
especially the grilled--

04:33.233 --> 04:35.267
- BARB: Oh!

04:37.800 --> 04:40.100
- Your father
has super-hiccups.

04:40.200 --> 04:42.933
They're like regular hiccups,
but they destroy buildings--

04:43.067 --> 04:46.333
and beach houses we dreamed
of growing old in.

04:47.767 --> 04:51.200
- First of all, that house
was built on a sandy cliff.

04:51.300 --> 04:53.867
Second of all, I don't
have the super-hiccups.

04:53.967 --> 04:55.067
I had one...

04:55.167 --> 04:56.300
and now it's gone.

04:56.400 --> 04:57.933
- Like my beach house.

05:01.767 --> 05:04.067
- Ooh, "Cutesy Cow" is on.

05:04.167 --> 05:06.200
- BILLY & NORA:

05:06.300 --> 05:08.133
- Can we all watch
it together?

05:08.233 --> 05:10.800
- BARB: Of course
we can, sweetie.

05:12.367 --> 05:15.933
- CUTESY COW: Hey, there,
kids, it's Cutesy Cow.

05:16.067 --> 05:17.633
Moo wants a hug?

05:17.733 --> 05:21.200
- CHLOE, BARB & HANK:
The Moo Crew!

05:21.300 --> 05:22.833
- Cutesy Cow is lame.

05:22.933 --> 05:25.200
- Yeah, back when Billy
and I were little kids,

05:25.300 --> 05:27.300
we had a way better
animal hero--

05:27.400 --> 05:29.333
- BILLY & NORA:
Hootie the Owl!

05:29.433 --> 05:31.433
- Hootie was cool
and he flew by his own rules.

05:31.533 --> 05:34.567
- I don't remember
Hootie having any rules.

05:34.667 --> 05:37.900
- Hey, Billy, let's find
our old Hootie DVDs

05:38.067 --> 05:39.267
and show them to Chloe.

05:39.367 --> 05:41.433
- No, you're not.
You wouldn't find them anyway.

05:41.533 --> 05:44.733
I hid those a long time ago.

05:49.867 --> 05:51.767
- It's cute when they
try to hide things.

05:53.667 --> 05:56.267
Let's show this to Chloe before
Cutesy Cow ruins her.

05:56.367 --> 05:58.600
Look, she's learning
how to brush her teeth.

05:58.700 --> 06:01.133
- * Moo-moo-moove your brush

06:01.233 --> 06:02.700
* Up and down your gums

06:02.800 --> 06:04.667
* Then be sure to
brush your hair *

06:04.767 --> 06:06.667
* Hygiene can be fun *

06:08.067 --> 06:12.100
Okay, now this
cow is just making up words.

06:12.200 --> 06:18.133
- *

06:18.233 --> 06:19.467
- MEN:

06:19.567 --> 06:22.167
- Allison's parents
opened an MMA gym?

06:23.967 --> 06:25.967
- I'm out!

06:26.067 --> 06:27.867
- Hey! Don't panic.

06:27.967 --> 06:30.067
Just remember I'm the one
doing all the talking.

06:30.100 --> 06:33.200
I just have to look up some
fancy MMA lingo like, oh,

06:33.300 --> 06:36.533
"crush windpipe," uh,
"welterweight,"

06:36.633 --> 06:38.667
and, ooh, "grappling dummy."

06:38.767 --> 06:41.467
- You're a grappling dummy.

06:41.567 --> 06:44.433
Sorry. Habit.
Please keep helping me.

06:44.533 --> 06:47.133
- Hey, Max!
- Hey!

06:49.067 --> 06:51.767
- Uh, she invited herself.

06:51.867 --> 06:54.433
So lonely and pathetic.

06:54.533 --> 06:56.433
- Come on, my parents
are over here.

06:59.400 --> 07:00.633
- And then he tried
a triangle choke,

07:00.733 --> 07:03.400
so, I snapped his back
in three places!

07:03.500 --> 07:06.500
Alli-Walli!

07:06.600 --> 07:09.500
- Hi, Mom, Dad,
this is Max.

07:09.600 --> 07:12.200
- And, uh, Phoebe,
Max's twin sister.

07:12.300 --> 07:13.800
I just love MMA.

07:13.900 --> 07:16.900
You two look like a couple
of awesome welterweights.

07:17.067 --> 07:20.067
- Oh, yes, we are.
You know your stuff.

07:20.133 --> 07:22.333
I'm Debbie. This is Gary.

07:22.433 --> 07:25.300
- So, we finally
get to meet

07:25.400 --> 07:27.333
our little girl's
so-called boyfriend!

07:29.333 --> 07:31.533
Yo, Mullet Head,

07:31.633 --> 07:33.833
1985 called and said that
haircut was lame in 1985!

07:35.900 --> 07:38.100
- Max, anything
you wanna say?

07:39.867 --> 07:41.500
I wanna ask your mom

07:41.600 --> 07:43.167
if her face got hit
by a makeup truck.

07:45.067 --> 07:46.833
- Max!

07:46.933 --> 07:48.933
- Uh...

07:49.067 --> 07:50.067
my sister's here!

07:50.133 --> 07:51.233
- Ha. Ha.

07:51.333 --> 07:54.233
Um, so, guys, um,
what's more fulfilling--

07:54.333 --> 07:57.967
opening your own business
or crushing someone's windpipe?

07:58.067 --> 07:58.933
- GARY & DEBBIE:
Windpipe!

07:59.067 --> 08:01.267
- Jinx! You owe me
a protein shake.

08:01.367 --> 08:02.533
- PHOEBE: Ha.

08:03.667 --> 08:05.267
- So, Phoebe's talking
to my parents.

08:05.367 --> 08:07.067
When are you
gonna step up?

08:07.100 --> 08:10.267
- Uh, as soon as Phoebe
lets me get a word in.

08:10.367 --> 08:12.167
Grappling dummy,
am I right?

08:12.267 --> 08:14.300
Anyway, let's eat!

08:14.400 --> 08:18.167
- *

08:18.267 --> 08:20.967
- CUTESY COW:
Who wants a hug?

08:21.067 --> 08:24.433
- CHLOE: The Moo Crew!
- NORA & BILLY: The Moo Crew...

08:30.633 --> 08:33.500
- Even the house
hates this show.

08:33.600 --> 08:36.100
- BARB: Okay, Hank,
outside now!

08:36.200 --> 08:37.567
We've gotta cure you
of your super-hiccups

08:37.667 --> 08:39.833
before you shake the house
to its foundation.

08:39.933 --> 08:41.933
- Barb, that was
definitely the last--

08:49.900 --> 08:51.833
- Kids, be good.
We're goin' outside.

08:54.867 --> 08:57.700
- Billy, this is our chance
to show Chloe "Hootie the Owl."

08:59.867 --> 09:03.233
Chloe, we have
something for you.

09:03.333 --> 09:04.500
- Cool! An owl.

09:04.600 --> 09:07.700
- Not just any owl.
Check this out.

09:09.800 --> 09:12.400
- * Hoot hoot!
Hootie don't care *

09:12.500 --> 09:14.900
* Hoot hoot!
Hootie don't care *

09:15.067 --> 09:17.300
* What do you
think about that **

09:17.400 --> 09:19.800
- Excuse me, Hootie,

09:19.900 --> 09:23.067
could you please help
me carry my groceries?

09:23.133 --> 09:24.467
- Hootie don't care!

09:26.067 --> 09:30.333
- *

09:30.433 --> 09:33.633
- Ha. Ha. That was funny.

09:33.733 --> 09:37.567
- I don't remember Hootie
harassing grandmas.

09:37.667 --> 09:39.733
- Hootie!

09:39.833 --> 09:42.133
You can't just eat that
candy without paying.

09:42.233 --> 09:43.333
That's stealing.

09:43.433 --> 09:45.067
- Hootie don't care.

09:48.333 --> 09:50.833
- *

09:50.933 --> 09:53.067
- * Hoot Hoot!
Hootie don't care *

09:53.100 --> 09:55.500
* Hoot! Hoot!
Hootie don't care *

09:55.600 --> 09:57.633
* What do you think
about that **

09:59.733 --> 10:03.633
- Maybe we shouldn't
have shown that to Chloe.

10:03.733 --> 10:05.700
- She's a good kid.

10:05.800 --> 10:07.467
I don't think we have
anything to worry about.

10:09.600 --> 10:12.333
Chloe don't care!

10:16.633 --> 10:18.567
Chloe don't care!

10:24.433 --> 10:26.767
- Chloe don't care!

10:28.167 --> 10:30.767
- This is your fault.

10:30.867 --> 10:33.233
- Chloe don't care!
Chloe don't care!

10:33.333 --> 10:34.533
Chloe don't care!

10:34.633 --> 10:38.000
- See how my arm is hanging
out of the socket?

10:38.100 --> 10:40.067
Best day ever!

10:41.800 --> 10:43.300
- Once again, in this
upside-down world,

10:43.400 --> 10:45.767
somebody likes Phoebe.

10:45.867 --> 10:47.333
We're good here. Later.

10:47.433 --> 10:48.600
- Oh, you can't leave.

10:48.700 --> 10:49.900
My dad still wants
to talk to you.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.167
- GARY: Hey, boy!

10:52.267 --> 10:53.800
- I wanna talk to you.

10:54.867 --> 10:57.867
Weird hair!

10:57.967 --> 10:58.767
- Hey, Max.

10:58.867 --> 11:00.967
Weird face!

11:01.067 --> 11:04.200
Phoebe, they're closing in.

11:04.300 --> 11:08.333
- Debbie, Gary, you know,
I've actually done

11:08.433 --> 11:09.700
a little bit of
fighting myself.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.267
Uh, let me show you
some of my moves.

11:11.367 --> 11:13.400
- No, I haven't had a chance
to talk to the elf yet.

11:15.367 --> 11:16.667
- I have to show you now.

11:16.767 --> 11:19.100
Here, why don't you
stand over here,

11:19.200 --> 11:21.533
and I'll go smack
this shirtless guy around.

11:21.633 --> 11:23.967
Ha! Ha! Bah!

11:24.067 --> 11:27.133
- Phoebe just keeps
buttin' in.

11:27.233 --> 11:28.333
I've gotta go.

11:28.433 --> 11:29.400
Great job, Phoebe.

11:31.300 --> 11:32.967
- MAX: Oh!

11:36.600 --> 11:39.500
- This gym is weak!

11:41.067 --> 11:44.100
- DEBBIE:
But, wait. Don't go.

11:46.833 --> 11:48.967
- I am so sorry.

11:49.067 --> 11:50.800
- You two ruined
our grand opening.

11:50.900 --> 11:52.100
- I'm sure they
didn't mean it.

11:52.200 --> 11:54.667
- No, I want the Blundermans
outta here now,

11:54.767 --> 11:57.267
and you will never
see Max again.

12:00.633 --> 12:04.233
- Okay, this seems like the
perfect time to remind you...

12:04.333 --> 12:06.233
this was your idea.

12:14.900 --> 12:17.267
- Max, I--
What is happening?

12:18.567 --> 12:19.533
- COLOSSO:

12:19.633 --> 12:20.733
Watching a little hockey,

12:20.833 --> 12:23.433
makin' Max forget
all about Allison.

12:23.533 --> 12:24.800
Max, tell her how much fun

12:24.900 --> 12:27.367
you're havin' with
your pally-wally.

12:27.467 --> 12:28.933
- I'm not and you're
this close

12:29.067 --> 12:31.500
to losing your
upstairs privileges.

12:31.600 --> 12:34.067
- Anyway, I think
I can convince

12:34.167 --> 12:35.900
Allison's parents
to let you two date again.

12:36.067 --> 12:38.367
- Oh, are you gonna kick
'em down a flight of stairs?

12:38.467 --> 12:40.533
Stay away from them!

12:40.633 --> 12:43.400
- Fine. But you're gonna
come crawlin' back

12:43.500 --> 12:45.700
for help, mister,
and when you do...

12:45.800 --> 12:47.933
I will totally help you
'cause I'm so, so sorry.

12:49.967 --> 12:53.300
- Gee, some people have no idea
when they're trying too hard.

12:55.267 --> 12:59.433
So, where are you gonna
take me for dinner, Maxy

12:59.533 --> 13:03.567
- It just went from
weird to what?

13:03.667 --> 13:05.400
I'm gonna go
get Allison back.

13:06.667 --> 13:09.067
- Heck, I shoulda
worn heels.

13:10.233 --> 13:12.433
- Well, Hank, we've tried
everything else

13:12.533 --> 13:13.933
to get rid of your
super-hiccups.

13:14.067 --> 13:16.333
Hopefully, this will
turn things around.

13:18.167 --> 13:20.800
- Ah, you can count on
this old Thunderman trick.

13:20.900 --> 13:23.067
We'll be back inside the house
before you can say--

13:27.400 --> 13:29.867
- Or we could just live in
the driveway from now on.

13:31.100 --> 13:33.100
- We'll be at this
as long as it takes.

13:33.200 --> 13:35.700
Billy and Nora are doing
a great job watching Chloe.

13:35.800 --> 13:37.700
- BILLY & NORA:
Where's Chloe?

13:37.800 --> 13:39.133
I thought you had her!

13:39.233 --> 13:42.400
- CHLOE: I don't care!

13:42.500 --> 13:46.067
- We've gotta fix her before Mom
and Dad find out about this.

13:46.100 --> 13:48.300
- Good luck with that.
Hootie's her master now.

13:48.400 --> 13:53.167
- No way. We've just gotta
put our foot down.

13:53.267 --> 13:57.300
Chloe Thunderman,
get up here this instant!

13:59.633 --> 14:02.733
- We've had enough
of this, young lady.

14:02.833 --> 14:06.333
- No more "Chloe don't care,"
and no more Hootie.

14:06.433 --> 14:08.567
- That was a mistake.

14:10.767 --> 14:15.467
- And stay out!

14:17.667 --> 14:19.867
- Chloe! You can't
lock us out.

14:19.967 --> 14:21.767
- Chloe don't care!

14:26.667 --> 14:27.833
- You showed her Hootie the--

14:27.933 --> 14:30.800
Owww...

14:30.900 --> 14:33.733
- It's pronounced "Owl."

14:33.833 --> 14:36.633
- We specifically told
you not to show her--

14:36.733 --> 14:41.067
Hey, my super-hiccups
are gone.

14:42.500 --> 14:45.267
- Just like we planned.

14:45.367 --> 14:48.500
- *

14:48.600 --> 14:50.667
- GARY:

14:50.767 --> 14:52.267
- All right, time
to win back Allison

14:52.367 --> 14:55.233
by not talking so her parents
don't find out I'm a jerk.

14:58.333 --> 15:02.133
- What are you doin' here,
Leprechaun?

15:02.233 --> 15:06.300
- DEBBIE: "I have laryngitis
and can't talk."

15:06.400 --> 15:08.167
- GARY: "I want to be
Alison's boyfriend again."

15:08.267 --> 15:10.867
Forget it! Not after what
you and your sister did.

15:10.967 --> 15:13.267
"Phoebe isn't my real sister.

15:13.367 --> 15:15.867
She was raised by
a pack of wolves"?

15:22.067 --> 15:23.767
- DEBBIE: "She went
back to her wolf family

15:23.867 --> 15:25.533
and you'll never
see her again."

15:25.633 --> 15:28.867
- Hello, it's me again.

15:28.967 --> 15:32.700
Gary, Debbie, I messed up
yesterday, not Max.

15:32.800 --> 15:34.333
- Phoebe, what are
you doing here?

15:34.433 --> 15:35.633
- Wait! You talked.

15:35.733 --> 15:39.333
- GARY: "The laryngitis
comes and goes."

15:42.167 --> 15:44.233
- Let me make things right.

15:44.333 --> 15:46.600
Come on, open up
the fighting cage

15:46.700 --> 15:48.900
in your heart
and let me in.

15:49.067 --> 15:52.867
- You wouldn't last two
seconds in my heart cage.

15:52.967 --> 15:55.067
Come on,
I'll do anything.

15:55.100 --> 15:59.067
- Actually, Gary, we do need
a sparring partner for Daisy.

15:59.100 --> 16:00.733
- You need someone
to spar with Daisy?

16:00.833 --> 16:01.867
I'll spar with Daisy.

16:01.967 --> 16:03.367
Who's Daisy?

16:03.467 --> 16:06.633
- Daisy is a world-
class MMA fighter.

16:06.733 --> 16:07.933
You couldn't handle her.

16:08.067 --> 16:11.200
- I took you guys down--

16:11.300 --> 16:12.533
by accident.

16:12.633 --> 16:14.733
Please let me help you.

16:14.833 --> 16:15.867
- Daisy will quit our gym

16:15.967 --> 16:17.700
if we don't give
her somebody to pound on.

16:17.800 --> 16:20.500
We can't afford to
lose another star.

16:20.600 --> 16:24.800
- Fine. Suit up and maybe
we'll forgive you.

16:24.900 --> 16:27.333
But you're still not
in my heart cage!

16:29.067 --> 16:30.933
- Phoebe, don't.
- Let me do this, Max.

16:31.067 --> 16:32.333
After they forgive me,

16:32.433 --> 16:34.467
maybe they'll reconsider
you and Allison.

16:34.567 --> 16:36.767
- But my plan was working.

16:36.867 --> 16:38.967
- What a stupid plan!

16:42.300 --> 16:44.067
- All right, your turn.
Please, don't mess this up.

16:44.133 --> 16:46.067
I won't.

16:46.133 --> 16:48.067
Hey, I'm a superhero,
remember?

16:48.167 --> 16:50.233
Besides, how bad could
this "Daisy" be?

16:50.333 --> 16:54.167
- It's Crazy Daisy!

16:57.900 --> 17:00.300
- The full name woulda
been helpful earlier.

17:00.400 --> 17:03.533
- Chloe, come on, we've been
out here long enough.

17:03.633 --> 17:05.733
We need to talk about this.

17:09.567 --> 17:11.533
- Chloe don't care!

17:11.633 --> 17:14.233
- All right, that's it.
I am breaking the door down.

17:14.333 --> 17:17.900
- Hank, it doesn't matter
if we're inside or outside.

17:18.067 --> 17:19.567
The problem is she's
stopped caring.

17:19.667 --> 17:22.267
We need to find something
that she cares about again.

17:22.367 --> 17:24.533
- Chloe loves watching
"Cutesy Cow" with us.

17:24.633 --> 17:27.300
We can do that.
- That's a great idea, Nora.

17:27.400 --> 17:31.167
Look, everyone,
it's "Cutesy Cow".

17:31.267 --> 17:34.767
Let's watch it together
as a family.

17:34.867 --> 17:36.800
- CUTESY COW:
Who wants a hug?

17:36.900 --> 17:41.067
- ALL: The Moo Crew!

17:44.100 --> 17:45.433
- Don't answer it, Mom.

17:45.533 --> 17:47.067
We all know what
she's going to say.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.533
- BARB:

17:48.633 --> 17:49.800
- Well, now what--

17:49.900 --> 17:51.133
ah...ah...
- Uh-oh.

17:51.233 --> 17:53.267
Hank, you sound like
you're coming down with a cold.

17:53.367 --> 17:55.900
- No, no, no way.
I am Thunderma-a-a-a...

17:56.067 --> 17:58.467
Oh! Oh! Oh!
- He's gonna super-sneeze!

17:58.567 --> 18:00.667
- NORA & BILLY:
Uh-oh!

18:00.767 --> 18:03.133
- Hold onto something!

18:03.233 --> 18:06.400
- Acho-o-o-o-o-o!

18:08.933 --> 18:11.233
- Chloe, you came outside.

18:11.333 --> 18:13.533
- I was worried
about my family.

18:13.633 --> 18:17.433
- Aw, that's sweet, honey,
but Daddy's fine.

18:17.533 --> 18:21.133
- Not you--them.

18:22.333 --> 18:26.467
She cares again.

18:26.567 --> 18:29.567
- That's grea-a-a-t.

18:37.133 --> 18:39.267
- DAISY:

18:42.067 --> 18:43.767
- Max, what are
you doing here?

18:47.900 --> 18:49.933
- Yeah, we came to make things
right with your parents,

18:50.067 --> 18:51.767
and I'm afraid this
was the only way.

18:51.867 --> 18:56.233
Get crazy, Daisy!

18:56.333 --> 18:59.200
- So, she's in there fighting
for our relationship.

18:59.300 --> 19:00.833
Shouldn't that be you?

19:00.933 --> 19:03.400
- Well, I can't risk my face.

19:03.500 --> 19:05.200
You know I have
the cheeks of a Norse god

19:05.300 --> 19:08.833
and the lips of
an Amazonian princess.

19:08.933 --> 19:10.967
- You don't think
I know that?

19:11.067 --> 19:13.067
What I meant was
I want you to have

19:13.100 --> 19:15.167
an actual conversation
with my parents.

19:15.267 --> 19:17.600
At least give them
a chance to see what I see.

19:17.700 --> 19:20.133
Fine.

19:20.233 --> 19:23.267
Hanging with Colosso
was never this hard.

19:23.367 --> 19:25.567
Weird, but not this hard.

19:25.667 --> 19:28.367
Gary, Debbie, a word?

19:30.067 --> 19:32.100
All right, here's the deal.

19:32.200 --> 19:33.967
I'm worried if
I opened my mouth,

19:34.067 --> 19:35.667
you guys wouldn't
like me, but,

19:35.767 --> 19:37.167
you know what,
you already don't like me.

19:37.267 --> 19:38.600
So, I'm just gonna tell
you how I really feel.

19:38.700 --> 19:41.067
- Oh, no, he's gonna
ruin all my hard work.

19:41.133 --> 19:42.667
Is that my leg?

19:42.767 --> 19:44.200
- DAISY:
Yeah!

19:44.300 --> 19:46.367
- The truth is...

19:46.467 --> 19:50.800
I really like
your daughter...

19:50.900 --> 19:53.267
and you splitting us up...

19:53.367 --> 19:54.967
has broken my heart...

19:55.067 --> 19:56.667
and I don't even
know I had one

19:56.767 --> 19:58.500
until I met Allison.

19:58.600 --> 20:00.667
- Did you just
talk to my parents

20:00.767 --> 20:02.733
without insulting them?

20:04.233 --> 20:06.500
What have you done to me?

20:06.600 --> 20:09.767
- PHOEBE: She's changing
you for the better! Oh!

20:11.600 --> 20:15.200
- You know, Max, now that you've
told me how you really feel,

20:15.300 --> 20:17.467
it changes nothing!

20:17.567 --> 20:21.900
You'll never ever
see my Alli-Walli again!

20:23.633 --> 20:28.367
- He said "you'll never ever
see my Alli-Walli again!"

20:32.000 --> 20:33.533
- I just don't
understand parents.

20:33.633 --> 20:36.767
Everything I saw on TV
told me this would work.

20:36.867 --> 20:38.100
- What is wrong
with you guys?

20:38.200 --> 20:39.700
That was really
hard for him.

20:39.800 --> 20:41.900
He never talks to adults
without insulting them,

20:42.000 --> 20:42.967
but he didn't make
fun of you.

20:43.067 --> 20:44.367
- Yeah, I didn't
say anything about

20:44.467 --> 20:46.233
that hat that y'all
be callin' a haircut!

20:46.333 --> 20:47.833
Or her paintball face!

20:47.933 --> 20:52.667
Was that out loud?

20:52.767 --> 20:54.733
- PHOEBE:
Very lo-o-o-o-ud!

20:54.833 --> 20:57.667
Whoa!

20:57.767 --> 21:01.733
- The thing is--Max
is a great boyfriend.

21:01.833 --> 21:03.133
He's not like other boys.

21:03.233 --> 21:05.067
He's fun, he's smart.

21:05.167 --> 21:07.467
One day, he's gonna
take over the world.

21:07.567 --> 21:11.233
- Well, it is on
my vision board.

21:11.333 --> 21:13.167
- I'm sorry, but you
can't treat me

21:13.267 --> 21:15.067
like your little
Alli-Walli forever.

21:15.167 --> 21:18.433
- She's right, Gare-Bear.

21:19.967 --> 21:23.067
- Well, I suppose if we have
to let you date somebody,

21:23.100 --> 21:24.200
it might as well be this...

21:24.300 --> 21:27.533
tiny woodland creature...

21:27.633 --> 21:31.733
even if he was completely wrong
about my sweet-sweet mullet.

21:31.833 --> 21:33.133
- PHOEBE:

21:33.233 --> 21:37.167
- So sweet.

21:37.267 --> 21:40.067
- Thanks, Mom and Dad.

21:40.167 --> 21:41.867
- Oh, Phoebe, you can
get outta there.

21:41.967 --> 21:43.100
Allison and I
are back together.

21:43.200 --> 21:44.300
- Finally!

21:50.067 --> 21:52.267
This gym rocks!

21:52.367 --> 21:54.200
- Thank you so much!

21:54.300 --> 21:55.733
- Don't call me "so much."

21:55.833 --> 21:57.967
Ma name's "Phoebe."

21:58.067 --> 22:01.167
- Ha! Good one.

22:01.267 --> 22:04.067
- Ah, still got it.
