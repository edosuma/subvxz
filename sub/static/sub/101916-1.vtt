that reservation.

Perhaps another
name I could try.

01:44.972 --> 01:47.940
- There must just
be a little mistake.

01:48.976 --> 01:50.943
Do you have a table for two?

01:52.980 --> 01:54.246

- Yeah.

05:53.887 --> 05:55.220
She gonna be okay?

05:56.557 --> 05:58.023
- A little dirty and it
looks like she hasn't eaten

05:58.058 --> 06:00.325
in a couple days, but
I'll call animal control.

06:00.361 --> 06:02.027
- No, no.

06:02.062 --> 06:03.061
- We do not take strays.

06:03.097 --> 06:04.529
It's your dad's policy.

06:04.565 --> 06:06.698
- Well, then it's gonna have
to be our little secret.

06:06.734 --> 06:11.002
Please, just give her an iv
and just do whatever it takes.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.270
- And who's gonna pay for it?

06:12.373 --> 06:14.206
- I will until she's well.

06:15.242 --> 06:16.508
- Hm, okay.

06:17.378 --> 06:18.377
- What is that?

06:19.747 --> 06:20.746
- My new friend.

06:21.915 --> 06:24.015
- That's the fifth
time this month.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.684
- I'm a bleeding heart.

06:25.719 --> 06:26.818
- You are.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.387
Here, take this
for me, thank you.

06:28.422 --> 06:29.688
I'll take a look at him.

06:29.723 --> 06:32.657
So, how are things?

06:32.760 --> 06:35.026
- What you mean besides the
fact that your retirement

06:35.062 --> 06:37.028
is going to include rough seas

06:37.064 --> 06:38.563
and that we still don't
have anyone interested

06:38.599 --> 06:40.165
in buying the vet clinic?

06:40.267 --> 06:42.401
- No no no, I meant last night.

06:42.436 --> 06:46.104
You know, karaoke, ice cream.

06:47.941 --> 06:50.742
Oh, let's see, he stood
you up again, right?

06:50.778 --> 06:51.676
- He stood me up.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.579
- Well, what was his
excuse this time?

06:54.615 --> 06:56.348
- Non-comunicato

06:56.450 --> 06:57.916
and I'm not even
gonna answer the phone

06:57.951 --> 06:59.217
even if he does call.

07:00.454 --> 07:03.255
I think he might be
allergic to commitment.

07:04.591 --> 07:07.259
- Well, he's flying
around the world,

07:07.294 --> 07:09.027
he's closing big
deals, you know?

07:10.464 --> 07:12.197
I don't know, something
might've happened.

07:12.299 --> 07:13.865
I'd give him some more time.

07:13.967 --> 07:16.768
- Dad, you know he is
promoting a concert

07:16.804 --> 07:19.404
in the florida keys and
his phone works just fine.

07:20.774 --> 07:25.410
Nah, it doesn't matter
'cause I really am tired

07:25.446 --> 07:27.913
of this long-distance thing.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.481
I mean, he's not gonna move here

07:29.516 --> 07:32.384
and I'm not gonna move
to some tropical island.

07:32.486 --> 07:33.285
- Why not?

07:34.488 --> 07:36.588
- Dad, as soon as
we sell this clinic,

07:36.623 --> 07:40.158
I'm opening up my music store
and I'm teaching full time.

07:40.194 --> 07:42.594
I need clients, not monkeys.

07:42.629 --> 07:44.629
- Doctor, your first
patient is in room one.

07:44.665 --> 07:45.430
- All right, thank you.

07:45.466 --> 07:46.331
I'll be right there.

07:49.503 --> 07:51.503
You know, when I
met your mother,

07:51.538 --> 07:52.904
I wasn't looking for love.

07:53.640 --> 07:54.906
Love just found me.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.749
- I think love just found me

08:06.220 --> 08:08.620
on the front doorstep
of our vet clinic.

08:13.026 --> 08:14.626
- I am in a band actually.

08:14.661 --> 08:16.628
- Wow, that's so cool.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.430
I've actually been
taking singing lessons

08:18.532 --> 08:19.831
at the singing studio in la.

08:19.867 --> 08:20.932
- [todd] really?

08:21.034 --> 08:22.200
- Yeah.
- That's awesome.

08:22.236 --> 08:24.669
Once I can make enough
money to fix my van,

08:24.705 --> 08:25.937
I'm out of here.

08:26.039 --> 08:28.206
I mean, for real hitting
the road with my boys,

08:28.242 --> 08:29.808
all the way to the big time.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.643
Yeah, hitting the stage.

08:31.678 --> 08:32.944
Everyone's gonna be
cheering my name.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.412
Can't you see it?

08:34.515 --> 08:36.448
Todd, todd, todd.

08:36.550 --> 08:37.315
- Todd!

08:38.252 --> 08:39.818
You know what I don't see?

08:39.853 --> 08:40.719
Soup bowl.

08:41.555 --> 08:44.456
- Soup bowls, got it.

08:44.558 --> 08:46.424
Sophie, keep singing.

08:46.527 --> 08:47.659
And rach, good to see you.

08:47.694 --> 08:48.527
- Hey todd.

08:49.363 --> 08:51.296
- Singer, you're a singer, huh?

08:51.398 --> 08:52.797
- I'm trying to be.

08:52.900 --> 08:55.267
I've just been looking up
stuff about vocal registers.

08:55.369 --> 08:57.836
- Oh, you should check
out eileen farrell.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.872
She's got a book on
mixing registers.

09:00.908 --> 09:02.641
I think it's wonderful.

09:02.743 --> 09:03.441
- Eileen?

09:03.544 --> 09:04.409
- Yes, farrell.

09:04.444 --> 09:05.810

you here before.

09:36.410 --> 09:37.842
- Yeah, emma's my sister.

09:39.279 --> 09:41.713
I took a sabbatical for the
winter semester after I...

09:48.455 --> 09:50.522
- A sabbatical, huh?

09:50.624 --> 09:51.890
- I teach english.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.359
- Wow, you're a
renaissance man, too.

09:54.461 --> 09:55.627

09:58.131 --> 09:59.798
Okay, I'll be back
with your order.

10:03.136 --> 10:04.202

10:05.138 --> 10:06.304
- Your dad?

10:07.507 --> 10:10.041
Oh, and your mom?

10:11.979 --> 10:13.945
- She's passed.

10:13.981 --> 10:15.080
- I'm sorry.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.314
- No, it's okay.

10:20.954 --> 10:25.123
- So, how do you
like our little town?

10:25.158 --> 10:27.225
- Oh, it's fine I guess.

10:27.327 --> 10:29.294
I've actually been
missing my lessons though,

10:29.329 --> 10:31.262
and I keep messing up this song.

10:31.298 --> 10:32.664
- Oh, what song is it?

10:32.699 --> 10:34.265
- "hark! The herald
angels sing."

10:34.301 --> 10:38.103
- yeah, I sang that song
in the christmas pageant.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.170
It's hard.

10:41.842 --> 10:44.342
- Sophia just got
given that same task.

10:44.378 --> 10:45.944
- Really?

10:45.979 --> 10:49.280
Well, I could actually help you.

10:49.316 --> 10:52.651
So I teach singing lessons
and piano at night.

10:52.686 --> 10:54.519
So if you want, I could
rearrange my schedule

10:54.554 --> 10:55.353
and help you out.

10:56.189 --> 10:57.422

10:57.524 --> 10:58.356

10:59.826 --> 11:01.126
Thank you, but you don't have

11:01.161 --> 11:02.694
to rearrange your
schedule for us.

- Actually, it

12:14.234 --> 12:16.000
- Oh, right, singing lessons.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.570
Yeah, sure.

12:18.605 --> 12:21.372
Why don't you bring sophia

12:21.408 --> 12:22.240

12:22.275 --> 12:23.208

15:20.487 --> 15:21.286

- Hi!

15:23.323 --> 15:24.689
You're so good.

15:25.625 --> 15:26.925
One lesson, huh?

15:26.960 --> 15:29.460
- Sophia's really doing great.

15:29.496 --> 15:31.763
I think you're gonna
have no problem.

15:31.798 --> 15:33.598
- Well, we can't
thank you enough.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.300
- It's my pleasure.

15:35.335 --> 15:36.467

- Mm-hm.

15:36.503 --> 15:37.769
- Cool.
- Let's go.

15:37.804 --> 15:38.937
- Hey, listen, if you
guys are free tomorrow,

15:38.972 --> 15:40.939
you should come by
the church bake sale.

15:42.208 --> 15:43.007
- [both] yeah.

15:43.043 --> 15:43.841
- Bake sale's good.

15:43.877 --> 15:45.076
- Yes.

15:45.211 --> 15:46.010
- All right, cool,
we'll be there.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.045
- Great, okay, bye sophia.

15:47.147 --> 15:47.979
- Bye.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.619
- [michael] this
is my swag walk.

15:54.721 --> 15:56.187
(both laughing)

15:56.222 --> 15:58.022
- [sophia] stop.

15:58.058 --> 15:59.457
- [michael] are you excited?

15:59.492 --> 16:00.792
- [sophia] I'm super
excited, it's so nice out.

16:00.827 --> 16:01.926
- [michael] it's beautiful out.

16:01.995 --> 16:03.194
- [sophia] yeah.

16:03.229 --> 16:04.062
- [michael] it does
not feel like winter.

16:04.164 --> 16:05.063
- [sophia] no, oh my gosh.

16:08.001 --> 16:09.334
- [rachael] almost.

16:09.369 --> 16:11.803
Where's it going?
- Whoa.

16:11.838 --> 16:12.971
A popcorn!
- Popcorn, yes!

16:13.006 --> 16:14.138
- You can take that.

16:15.842 --> 16:16.941
Oh, you guys made it.

16:17.077 --> 16:18.176
I'm so glad.

16:18.211 --> 16:19.978
Hey sophia, have
you seen our santa?

16:20.013 --> 16:23.114
- What would you like
for christmas, young man?

16:23.249 --> 16:25.283
- I am a little old for santa.

16:25.418 --> 16:28.186
- Okay, well don't let
me hear you say that.

16:28.221 --> 16:29.354
- Right.

16:29.389 --> 16:31.322
- So there's also
some really good games

16:31.358 --> 16:33.791
on the inside there
with awesome prizes.

16:33.927 --> 16:35.159
- Oh, sounds good.

16:36.396 --> 16:37.495
- All right, yeah, cool.

16:37.597 --> 16:38.663
- Okay.
- See you later.

16:38.765 --> 16:39.897
- [sophia] yep.

16:39.933 --> 16:40.665
- Text me in half
an hour please.

16:40.700 --> 16:41.632
- [sophia] okay, dad.

16:43.069 --> 16:47.372
- So, has she made a lot of
new friends while she's here?

16:47.407 --> 16:48.673
- No, not really.

16:48.775 --> 16:50.241
- Oh.

16:50.276 --> 16:52.543
- She's had a little bit
of a hard time, you know.

16:52.579 --> 16:54.345
That's partly my fault.

16:54.381 --> 16:55.913
- Oh, well.

16:55.949 --> 16:57.148
- But she loves your class.

16:57.283 --> 16:59.117
- Oh, I'm so glad to hear that.

16:59.219 --> 17:00.651
- Yeah, me too.

17:00.787 --> 17:01.486
- So, do you sing?

17:01.621 --> 17:02.453
- No, no.

17:03.590 --> 17:06.691
No, she definitely gets
her voice from her mom.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.359
- [rachael] well, come on,
I think there's a singer

17:08.395 --> 17:10.361
in there somewhere.

17:10.397 --> 17:11.863
♪ I like peanut butter ♪

17:11.898 --> 17:13.264
(rachael laughs)

17:13.299 --> 17:15.233
- I am happy to give
you lessons anytime.

17:15.268 --> 17:16.401
- Oh wow.

17:16.436 --> 17:17.535
- Rachael.
- Yeah?

17:17.570 --> 17:19.037
- We have a problem.

17:19.072 --> 17:20.938
The bake sales are way
down compared to last year

17:20.974 --> 17:24.375
and I don't know what to do.
- Well, now we just started.

17:24.411 --> 17:26.377
I'm sure things will pick up.

17:26.413 --> 17:27.712
- I don't think so.

17:27.747 --> 17:30.181
Keto's in, sugar's out.

17:30.316 --> 17:33.084
Okay, I said veggies
and bacon bites,

17:33.119 --> 17:36.187
but someone vetoed me.

17:36.322 --> 17:37.955
- How festive are bacon bites?

17:37.991 --> 17:39.524
- Unilaterally festive.

17:40.326 --> 17:42.427
- Okay, how short are we?

17:42.462 --> 17:43.561
- 2,000.

17:43.663 --> 17:44.562
- Huh?

17:44.664 --> 17:45.396
Dollars?

17:45.432 --> 17:46.397
- [ellen] yes.

17:46.499 --> 17:48.399
- For costumes?

17:48.435 --> 17:49.734
- They're authentic.

17:49.769 --> 17:52.570
- Was that from zero b.C.
Or would that be a.D.?

17:52.605 --> 17:54.906
- Maybe they turn the
sundials back a little.

17:54.941 --> 17:56.074
- They could've.

17:56.109 --> 17:57.675
- How are we gonna
sell all these sweets?

17:59.012 --> 18:00.545
- Okay, well...

18:02.015 --> 18:06.417
Oh, what's happening in that
head of yours over there?

18:07.654 --> 18:09.554
- I got a little idea.
- Yeah, what is it?

18:10.623 --> 18:12.390
- A little cookie-off.

18:12.525 --> 18:13.658
- Okay.
- Whoever sells

18:13.693 --> 18:15.526
the least cookies, buys
the other one dinner.

18:16.663 --> 18:18.429
- You are on.

18:18.465 --> 18:20.598
- Oh yeah, it is on.

18:20.633 --> 18:22.100
- Let's go.
- Let's do it.

18:23.169 --> 18:24.635
- [rachael] come on, we got it.

18:24.671 --> 18:25.903
- All right, let's do this.

lay round about ♪

18:31.044 --> 18:33.811

18:45.358 --> 18:47.091
- what are you doing?

18:47.227 --> 18:48.359
- [michael] selling cookies.

18:48.394 --> 18:49.127
- No, I know you're
selling cookies,

18:49.162 --> 18:50.495
but what is it for?

18:50.530 --> 18:51.462
- The pageant.

18:52.365 --> 18:54.031
- I see you meet rachael.

18:54.067 --> 18:56.801
- Oh, yeah, no.

18:56.836 --> 18:57.635
It's not like that.

18:57.670 --> 18:58.436
It's a bet.

18:58.571 --> 18:59.704
- What is the bet?

18:59.739 --> 19:01.506
- Nothing really, just
a little whoever sells

19:01.541 --> 19:03.274
the least amount of cookies

19:03.409 --> 19:04.642
has to take the
other one to dinner.

19:04.677 --> 19:07.979
- I have some cookies to buy.

19:08.014 --> 19:09.013
- [michael] yes, you do!

19:09.048 --> 19:09.847
- From her!

19:09.883 --> 19:10.848
- [michael] what?

19:10.884 --> 19:11.682
- [emma] bye.

19:11.718 --> 19:12.517
- Yeah right.

19:12.552 --> 19:13.518
Emma?

19:13.553 --> 19:14.852
Oh, come on, that's--

19:14.888 --> 19:17.655
- oh, roasted by
your own sister.

19:17.690 --> 19:18.990
That's savage, my boy.

19:19.025 --> 19:20.525
It's savage.

19:20.560 --> 19:21.792
- Thanks, santa.

19:21.928 --> 19:23.361
- I must get back
to the north pole.

19:23.396 --> 19:27.298
You see, ever since I was a
little missing a few years ago,

19:27.433 --> 19:29.100
mrs. Claus worries about me.

19:31.104 --> 19:33.638
And michael, don't
give up on love.

19:34.741 --> 19:36.307
Just when you think
it's gone forever,

19:36.442 --> 19:37.842
love has a way of surprising you

19:37.877 --> 19:40.511
with someone you least suspect.

19:42.048 --> 19:46.717
Oh, and sophia would like
twinkie for christmas.

19:46.753 --> 19:48.186
- What's twinkie?

19:48.221 --> 19:49.720
- A puppy, michael.

19:49.756 --> 19:50.655
A puppy.

19:54.894 --> 19:56.394
- Emma, hi.
- How's it going?

19:56.429 --> 19:58.563
- Great actually.
- Good.

19:58.598 --> 20:01.199
I would like to donate 40.

20:01.234 --> 20:03.401
- Really, you're
giving it to me?

20:03.436 --> 20:04.335
- [emma] to you.

20:04.470 --> 20:05.303
- Uh-huh.
- Mm-hm.

20:06.406 --> 20:08.339
- I appreciate that.
- You're welcome.

20:08.474 --> 20:10.107
- You're gonna help me win.

20:10.143 --> 20:11.909
- That is the plan.

20:11.945 --> 20:13.578
- You could tell him
that I like italian food

20:13.613 --> 20:14.745
when he takes me out.

20:14.781 --> 20:16.347
- Italian food, got it.

20:16.482 --> 20:18.549
- Has he always been
this competitive?

20:18.585 --> 20:21.719
- Yeah, and also a
really sore loser.

20:21.821 --> 20:24.589
- Is he? (laughs)

20:24.624 --> 20:25.523
- okay.

20:27.093 --> 20:27.892
Good luck.

20:27.927 --> 20:29.060
- Thank you.

20:29.095 --> 20:29.860
- [both] bye.

20:31.764 --> 20:33.397
- Oh, goodie, goodie, goodie.

20:33.433 --> 20:36.133
It's a bake sale, how wonderful.

20:36.169 --> 20:38.336
- Dad, whatcha wearing?

20:38.438 --> 20:40.771
- Oh, this is as close
to a japanese kimono

20:40.807 --> 20:42.039
that I could get.

20:42.175 --> 20:44.141
And I'm celebrating
the emperor's birthday,

20:44.177 --> 20:46.110
and it's a national holiday.

20:46.145 --> 20:47.612
- In japan.

20:47.647 --> 20:49.614
Why are you celebrating it?

20:49.649 --> 20:51.215
- It gives me a chance to
wear something different.

20:51.351 --> 20:52.383
How much for a bag of cookies?

20:52.518 --> 20:54.619
- 50--
- no, dad.

20:54.654 --> 20:56.320
You are pre-diabetic.

20:56.356 --> 20:57.888
- I'm pre-disposed
to kick your butt

20:58.024 --> 20:59.390
unless you sell me
a bag of cookies.

20:59.525 --> 21:01.759
Otherwise I'm going over
there to your competition.

21:01.794 --> 21:03.294
- Oh, you wouldn't.

21:05.131 --> 21:07.265
All right, then, $50.

21:09.469 --> 21:10.301
- 50?

21:11.371 --> 21:12.770
I see the game you're playing.

21:12.805 --> 21:14.305
Trying to price me out, right?

21:15.842 --> 21:17.208
This is for the children.

21:19.679 --> 21:24.515
Okay, oh, oh dad, don't
look now, but donna's here.

21:24.550 --> 21:26.050
- Don't look now?

21:26.152 --> 21:28.419
I've been trying to get a
date with her for 10 years.

21:28.488 --> 21:30.321
- Dad, that's brad's mom.

21:32.325 --> 21:33.090
- Hello donna.

21:34.027 --> 21:35.293
- Carter.

21:35.395 --> 21:36.527
- You know, I was thinking

21:36.562 --> 21:40.131
that we should maybe
download a movie.

21:40.233 --> 21:41.365
Grumpy old men.

21:41.401 --> 21:43.534
- I don't do biographies.

21:43.569 --> 21:46.937
- Well, how about santa claus?

21:47.707 --> 21:50.341
- Million to one chance.

21:56.015 --> 21:57.882
- I like those odds.

21:57.917 --> 21:59.517
- Dad, she can't stand you.

21:59.552 --> 22:00.418
- Me?

22:01.721 --> 22:03.721
You're the one that told
her she was coddling brad.

22:03.756 --> 22:05.890
- I was telling the truth.

22:05.925 --> 22:07.992
- Yeah, well, it
upset her, sweetheart.

22:08.895 --> 22:10.294
Anyway, it's all a front.

22:10.430 --> 22:12.363
She can't keep her
mind off of me.

22:14.767 --> 22:15.566
- Hello.

22:15.601 --> 22:16.867
- [michael] hi.

22:16.903 --> 22:18.736
- I heard that there was
a bake sale competition.

22:18.771 --> 22:22.740
- Well there just happens to
be a bake sale competition.

22:22.775 --> 22:24.542
- What's going on over there?

22:24.577 --> 22:27.278
- And it's against them?

22:27.380 --> 22:28.879
- Oh.

22:28.915 --> 22:31.549
- Oh, it's against them.

22:31.584 --> 22:34.051
- Then I'll buy
whatever you have left.

22:34.087 --> 22:35.353
- Yes.

22:35.388 --> 22:36.887
Yes!

22:36.923 --> 22:38.923
- Does this cover it?

22:38.958 --> 22:40.358
- Wow.

22:40.460 --> 22:41.859
- I think I do.

22:47.600 --> 22:51.736
- 1500, 1600, and 1700.

22:51.771 --> 22:53.604
The winner is michael.

22:53.639 --> 22:54.705
- Yes!
- Okay,

22:54.741 --> 22:56.207
I demand a recount!

22:56.242 --> 22:59.076
- And in the true
spirit of christmas,

22:59.112 --> 23:02.747
we have enough to buy
costumes, a manger,

23:02.782 --> 23:04.315
and a glowing baby jesus.

23:05.418 --> 23:06.450
- [rachael] love that.

23:06.486 --> 23:07.351
- Ellen!

23:08.254 --> 23:09.587
Ellen!
- Wow.

23:10.957 --> 23:12.790
- I guess I'm buying dinner.

23:12.825 --> 23:14.225
- Oh, that's okay.

23:14.260 --> 23:15.626
I gotta take sophia home.

23:15.661 --> 23:17.595
- Oh, no, no no.

23:18.664 --> 23:19.697
I'm gonna take soph home

23:19.766 --> 23:22.199
and you guys are gonna
have a good night.

23:22.335 --> 23:23.467
- I won't wait up.

23:23.503 --> 23:24.435
- I'm sorry, what?

23:26.672 --> 23:27.505
- I like this one.

23:31.144 --> 23:32.042
- Good.

23:37.150 --> 23:40.651
- So, what are you up for?

23:40.686 --> 23:41.619
- Oh.

23:43.689 --> 23:45.423
I'm gonna go with lady's choice.

23:45.458 --> 23:47.291
- All right, I have
something in mind.

23:56.702 --> 23:58.636
- No, I am, I'm a total foodie.

23:58.738 --> 24:02.039
I just, japanese food, I
can't do the chopsticks.

24:02.074 --> 24:03.774
- [both] thank you.

24:03.876 --> 24:05.209
- Oh yeah, no, chopsticks?

24:05.244 --> 24:06.710
- Yeah.
- All in the thumb.

24:06.746 --> 24:08.345
- Yeah, but see I have
really small thumbs though.

24:08.381 --> 24:10.815
- I'm sorry, you have what?

24:10.917 --> 24:14.051
- Oh, I have small thumbs.

24:14.086 --> 24:15.386
Look at that, I know.

24:15.421 --> 24:16.220
I know.

24:16.255 --> 24:17.988
- They are not small.

24:18.090 --> 24:19.423
They're fine, they're great.

24:19.459 --> 24:20.357
You have great thumbs.
- Okay.

24:20.393 --> 24:22.660
You're just being nice now.

24:22.762 --> 24:24.662
- I don't really hear that.

24:24.764 --> 24:26.797
- [rachael] oh, no, why not?

24:26.899 --> 24:29.066
- My students call me
professor try hard.

24:30.102 --> 24:31.969
- What, why?

24:32.104 --> 24:33.103
- I give 'em a lot of homework.

24:33.139 --> 24:36.006
- Oh, no, really?

24:36.108 --> 24:36.907
- Yeah.

24:38.945 --> 24:40.244
Great literature is only learned

24:40.279 --> 24:42.146
by turning the pages of time.

24:43.616 --> 24:44.748
There's a lot of pages.

24:45.585 --> 24:47.685
- I definitely love to read.

24:47.787 --> 24:50.654
You will not find a
television in my bedroom.

24:51.791 --> 24:52.556
- Me too.

24:54.494 --> 24:57.228
- Okay, Sunday's are for?

24:57.263 --> 25:01.765
- Easy, mediation,
hiking, reading.

25:01.801 --> 25:04.835
- Okay, did my dad clue you in?

25:04.971 --> 25:05.669
He must've.

25:05.771 --> 25:06.570
- No.

25:07.974 --> 25:08.739
Speaking of your dad.

25:08.774 --> 25:10.241
- Mm-hm?

25:10.276 --> 25:11.108
- How long has he
been grooming you

25:11.143 --> 25:12.576
to take over the family biz?

25:12.612 --> 25:13.511
- Oh man.

25:14.814 --> 25:16.981
Seriously, as long
as I can remember.

25:18.351 --> 25:22.286
I was just a little kid and
I was elbow deep inside.

25:22.321 --> 25:24.889
I mean, I was helping
with the birthing

25:24.991 --> 25:27.958
and that was not something
that you say at a dinner date.

25:28.828 --> 25:29.593
But I liked it.

25:29.629 --> 25:31.328
I really liked it.

25:31.364 --> 25:32.263
- You liked it?

25:32.298 --> 25:34.865
- No, I mean, not that part.

25:35.001 --> 25:37.001
I mean, I like helping animals.

25:37.036 --> 25:40.070
It was really, it was
a lot of hard work,

25:40.172 --> 25:42.640
but it was really rewarding.

25:42.675 --> 25:44.608
- Now that I understand.

25:46.178 --> 25:47.144
Try that with college kids.

25:47.179 --> 25:48.546
- Oh yeah, no.

25:51.017 --> 25:54.285
- So, what's next?

25:54.320 --> 25:59.156
- Well, I mean, as soon
as we sell the clinic,

25:59.191 --> 26:00.324
my dad wants to travel.

26:00.359 --> 26:01.325
I'm just really worried
about his health.

26:01.360 --> 26:02.560
- No no no.

26:04.196 --> 26:05.629
What's next with rachael?

26:06.966 --> 26:08.098
- Music store.

26:08.200 --> 26:09.300
- Nice.

26:09.335 --> 26:11.168
- Oh yeah, my mom
was a music teacher,

26:11.203 --> 26:15.639
and I just love loved
listening to her sing

26:15.675 --> 26:17.074
and play piano.

26:17.209 --> 26:20.110
And you know, I just
thought to myself,

26:20.212 --> 26:24.348
well just why not
be around that more?

26:24.383 --> 26:25.683
- So no more animals?

26:25.718 --> 26:26.917
- Not for now.

26:27.053 --> 26:28.319
You know, maybe someday.

26:30.222 --> 26:32.356
But I'm in a place in my life

26:32.391 --> 26:34.658
that if a opportunity shows up,

26:34.694 --> 26:36.360
I gotta go for it.

26:36.395 --> 26:38.429
'cause it might not
come around again.

26:44.437 --> 26:45.336
- Are you single?

26:46.872 --> 26:49.073
- Well that was pretty forward.

26:49.108 --> 26:51.609
- But you are out on
a date with, you know.

26:52.578 --> 26:53.510
- With...

26:53.546 --> 26:54.945
- Me.

26:55.047 --> 26:56.413
- Oh.

26:56.449 --> 27:00.684
- Single dad, beautiful
daughter, I have to protect.

27:03.889 --> 27:06.724
I just can't let
anybody into our circle.

27:06.759 --> 27:08.225
- There's no one else.

27:09.295 --> 27:10.194
Just me.

27:15.101 --> 27:16.900
- Can I get you
guys anything else?

27:18.404 --> 27:20.838
- Would you mind
taking our picture?

27:20.940 --> 27:21.805
- Sure.

27:23.275 --> 27:24.008
- Is that weird?

27:24.110 --> 27:24.908
- No.
- Okay.

27:28.247 --> 27:29.713
Thank you.

27:29.749 --> 27:32.116

27:32.151 --> 27:34.818

Wow.

27:59.278 --> 28:02.046
Huh, hasn't seen you in what?

28:02.148 --> 28:03.313
A year.

28:03.349 --> 28:04.782
- It's a big world
out there, emma.

28:04.817 --> 28:07.885
You oughta get out of your
bubble and check it out.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.853
(emma laughs)

28:09.955 --> 28:13.023
- I moved from
new york, bradley,

28:13.125 --> 28:15.259
so I'm perfectly
fine in my bubble.

28:18.164 --> 28:19.296
What can I do for you?

28:19.331 --> 28:20.464
- What do you think?

28:20.499 --> 28:21.899
I'm here for the coffee.

28:22.001 --> 28:25.903
- Huh, for you it's 5 bucks.

28:26.005 --> 28:28.038
- 5 bucks?

28:28.174 --> 28:30.307
- Inflation is crazy.

28:30.342 --> 28:31.875
- $5 coffee, here you go.

28:31.977 --> 28:33.711
There's five, keep
the change, kid.

28:36.315 --> 28:37.147
Hey.

28:37.983 --> 28:38.949
- Yeah?

28:38.984 --> 28:40.250
- I've been looking for rachael.

28:40.352 --> 28:41.552
You haven't seen her
around, have you?

28:42.722 --> 28:44.822
Drove by the
clinic, it's closed.

28:44.857 --> 28:46.824
For sale sign out front.

28:46.859 --> 28:48.992
I drove by her house
and she's not there.

28:49.028 --> 28:50.160
Didn't move, did she?

28:51.330 --> 28:53.897
- Do you think, crazy thought,

28:54.033 --> 28:58.235
she realized you're
a opportunistic,
two-face womanizer?

28:58.370 --> 28:59.903
- (chuckles) I doubt it.

29:00.940 --> 29:03.240
Come on, it's christmas
and you know everyone.

29:03.342 --> 29:04.475
- Wouldn't have a clue.

29:08.047 --> 29:10.481
- Ugh, this coffee's terrible.

29:11.684 --> 29:13.350
Nu-uh, no.

29:13.385 --> 29:14.318
Well, tell you what,

29:14.353 --> 29:17.087
if you see her, rachael that is,

29:17.223 --> 29:21.024
just tell her the brad is back.

29:21.894 --> 29:22.659
- Loved to.

29:22.695 --> 29:23.494
- Okay.

29:23.529 --> 29:24.428
- Okay.

29:27.066 --> 29:29.399
Oh, brad, brad brad brad.
(nervously chuckles)

29:29.435 --> 29:30.367
- yes yes yes?

29:31.737 --> 29:32.603
I...

29:35.040 --> 29:35.839
- Yes?

29:37.076 --> 29:38.675
- Merry christmas.

29:38.711 --> 29:40.778
- Huh, same to you.

29:47.219 --> 29:47.951
- Oh, sorry, pal.

29:48.053 --> 29:48.719
- Sorry, pal.

29:48.754 --> 29:49.953
- Yeah, merry christmas.

29:50.055 --> 29:51.588
- [brad] merry christmas.

29:51.624 --> 29:52.422
- Hey.

29:52.458 --> 29:53.724
- [michael] hey.

29:53.759 --> 29:54.525
- What's up?

29:54.560 --> 29:55.459
- Nothing.

29:56.262 --> 29:57.561
Just here to help you close.

29:57.596 --> 29:58.762
- [emma] thanks.

29:58.798 --> 29:59.596
- How's sophia?

29:59.632 --> 30:01.165
- She's good.

30:01.267 --> 30:04.067
She is with my friend,
frances and her daughter, mae.

30:04.103 --> 30:04.968
- That's good.

30:06.272 --> 30:07.437
- Okay, you didn't just
freak out about that.

30:07.473 --> 30:08.438
I'm impressed.

30:08.474 --> 30:10.174
- Oh, I'm sure she's fine.

30:10.276 --> 30:11.241
- Yeah, she's fine.

30:14.413 --> 30:15.412
I wanted to talk--

30:15.447 --> 30:16.747
- hey.
- Yeah?

30:16.782 --> 30:17.714
- Thanks.

30:18.784 --> 30:20.017
I love you.

30:20.119 --> 30:21.451
- I love you, too.

30:21.487 --> 30:22.252
- I'll get ready.

30:22.288 --> 30:23.120
- Okay.

30:24.456 --> 30:25.422
All right.

30:25.457 --> 30:26.723
Can you clear this?

30:26.759 --> 30:28.158
- Yeah yeah, I
was getting there.

30:28.260 --> 30:28.992
- You're on it.

30:35.134 --> 30:36.633
Can I get you anything?

30:36.669 --> 30:38.168
- Yeah, I'll take the--

30:38.270 --> 30:41.371
- well, tyler, I think
jeff is gonna be just fine.

30:41.473 --> 30:43.073
He's a little green
around the gills,

30:43.108 --> 30:44.741
but he's not belly up.

30:45.845 --> 30:47.211
No, I'm joking.

30:47.313 --> 30:49.046
Bad joke, bad joke.

30:49.148 --> 30:50.948
He's gonna be just fine, okay?

30:50.983 --> 30:52.616
- Okay, I was really
worried about him.

30:52.651 --> 30:53.917
- I know you were.

30:53.953 --> 30:55.819
Make sure you change his
water once a week, okay.

30:55.855 --> 30:57.054
- Okay, thank you doctor.

30:57.089 --> 30:58.288
- Okay, bye bye.

30:59.358 --> 31:02.192
(rachael humming)

31:05.164 --> 31:07.264
- I know that song.

31:07.299 --> 31:09.933
Your mom use to sing it to
you when you were a kid.

31:09.969 --> 31:11.301
- Yep.

31:11.337 --> 31:16.440
- So, how was your
date with michael?

31:17.343 --> 31:18.375
- Can't call it a date, dad.

31:18.510 --> 31:20.110
Come on, we just meet.

31:20.145 --> 31:21.945
- Well, what should
I call it then?

31:22.648 --> 31:26.483
- A shared dinner engagement.

31:26.518 --> 31:27.985
- Oh, come on.

31:28.020 --> 31:31.188
Engagement, date,
what's the difference?

31:33.525 --> 31:36.226
All right, all right, what
time does sadler come?

31:36.328 --> 31:37.628
- Three o'clock.

31:37.663 --> 31:41.231
- Three o'clock, oh,
I'm so busy then.

31:41.333 --> 31:43.100
- No, dad, no.

31:43.202 --> 31:46.403
No, he needs to see
the clinic in action.

31:46.505 --> 31:47.838
- Why do I have to
sell the clinic?

31:47.873 --> 31:49.339
I don't need the money.

31:49.375 --> 31:52.109
- Because if you
don't sell the clinic,

31:52.211 --> 31:54.278
you're never going to retire.

31:54.380 --> 31:55.312
- Is that so bad?

31:55.347 --> 31:58.849
- Yes, dad, please.

31:58.884 --> 32:01.018
Come on, this is
for your health.

32:01.053 --> 32:02.152
- My health?

32:02.187 --> 32:03.520
Look at me, I'm fit as a fiddle.

32:03.555 --> 32:07.524
- Okay, I can't keep
having this conversation.

32:07.559 --> 32:09.526
I got a chihuahua in two.

32:10.529 --> 32:11.395
- Okay.

32:15.601 --> 32:16.366
- Dad.

32:16.402 --> 32:17.401
- What, he's cute.

32:20.372 --> 32:22.673
I got a barn call, I'll be back.

32:22.708 --> 32:25.676
Hael whistling)

32:28.047 --> 32:29.012
- enjoy, bon appetit.

32:29.048 --> 32:30.514
- Ole!
- Hey!

32:30.549 --> 32:33.517
- Whoa, baryshnikov, you
wanna tone it down a little?

32:33.552 --> 32:34.885
You've been buzz'n
since you got in here.

32:34.920 --> 32:36.219
- So?

32:36.255 --> 32:37.154
Life is good.

32:38.524 --> 32:41.191
I was also thinking about
making christmas dinner.

32:41.226 --> 32:43.026
- I'm pretty sure that's my gig.

32:43.062 --> 32:45.329
- I know, but you do it
like 365 days a year.

32:45.364 --> 32:47.331
I'm pretty sure you
can take a break.

32:48.734 --> 32:51.168
I was also thinking about
inviting a few people over.

32:51.203 --> 32:52.135
- Rachael?

32:54.039 --> 32:54.871
- No.

32:55.741 --> 32:56.807
Todd.

32:56.909 --> 32:57.808
- What?

32:57.910 --> 32:59.309
- Todd's got a crush on you.

33:07.453 --> 33:09.886
- Yeah, I noticed that.

33:09.922 --> 33:10.921
Yeah, yeah.

33:12.257 --> 33:13.223
- Should I?

33:13.258 --> 33:14.558
- Invite todd?

33:14.593 --> 33:15.826
- You serious?

33:15.928 --> 33:16.693
- What?
- Rachael.

33:16.729 --> 33:17.661
- Oh, yes.

33:19.398 --> 33:21.798
I think you should
invite rachael.

33:21.900 --> 33:23.867
But I'm gonna be cooking.

33:23.902 --> 33:25.268
- Whatever.
- I'll leave you with that.

33:25.304 --> 33:26.203
- [both] yeah.

33:30.275 --> 33:31.108
- You serious?

33:31.143 --> 33:32.075
Come on, man.

33:34.113 --> 33:36.246
(michael chuckles)

33:36.281 --> 33:38.415
- are you sure these rooms
can handle farm animals?

33:38.450 --> 33:39.850
- Oh yeah.

33:39.952 --> 33:41.518
We had goldfish in
here this morning.

33:42.788 --> 33:46.256
And our facility does
offer on-site services

33:46.291 --> 33:48.558
to dozens of different
farms in the area

33:48.594 --> 33:50.060
with plenty of room to grow.

33:51.463 --> 33:53.397
It's just that my dad, he
slowed down a little bit.

33:54.600 --> 33:55.432
- Good.

33:55.467 --> 33:56.767
And the asking price?

33:57.770 --> 33:59.269
- Well, I mean, it's negotiable,

33:59.304 --> 34:01.238
but honestly, it's really fair.

34:01.273 --> 34:04.441
I mean, we're giving you
an established clientele

34:04.476 --> 34:06.877
and a storefront.

34:06.979 --> 34:07.844
You know, my dad
has built this place

34:07.946 --> 34:10.280
over the last 40 years.

34:10.315 --> 34:11.281
It's a little comfortable.
- I know she's here.

34:11.316 --> 34:12.716
I hear her voice.

34:17.489 --> 34:18.922
- Hey.

34:18.957 --> 34:20.590
- Brad, what are you doing here?

34:20.626 --> 34:22.759
- Wow, good to see you too.

34:22.795 --> 34:24.594
Brought you some roses.

34:24.630 --> 34:25.562
- Nope.

34:26.965 --> 34:27.798
- Aw.

34:29.301 --> 34:30.934
Hey buddy.

34:30.969 --> 34:32.769
- How you doing?
- Brad thomas.

34:32.805 --> 34:34.137
Rachael's boyfriend.

34:34.173 --> 34:36.506
- Doctor sadler, potential
buyer of the clinic.

34:36.542 --> 34:39.142
- Doctor, come on, you
gotta be kidding me.

34:39.178 --> 34:41.445
You look a day over 18.

34:41.480 --> 34:43.146
You really buying this place?

34:43.182 --> 34:45.749
Wow, your daddy giving
you a little loan?

34:46.552 --> 34:47.784
- I'm paying cash.

34:47.820 --> 34:52.055
- Wow, doctor sadler,
here's my card

34:52.157 --> 34:55.759
and I think I might
have a deal for you.

34:56.528 --> 34:58.095
You like the islands?

34:58.197 --> 35:00.030
The concert in norman's
cay, memorial day weekend

35:00.065 --> 35:04.367
and I happen to have a few
extra vip beach houses.

35:04.403 --> 35:06.636
And that's exclusive,
that's just for you.

35:06.672 --> 35:08.772
- Sounds like a great time.

35:08.874 --> 35:11.308
- Doctor s on the
beach, brother.

35:11.343 --> 35:12.209
- Yeah.

35:12.244 --> 35:14.377
- Well, that's really great.

35:14.413 --> 35:15.312
That's great.

35:16.215 --> 35:16.980
Well, thank you.

35:17.015 --> 35:18.949
- Yes, I'll be in touch.

35:19.051 --> 35:19.950
Nice to meet you.

35:20.052 --> 35:21.485
- See you later, little brother.

35:23.021 --> 35:24.354
You see that?

35:24.389 --> 35:25.322
He likes me.

35:26.558 --> 35:28.658
- Everyone likes
you except for me.

35:31.196 --> 35:32.796
- Hey, wait a minute, sweetie.

35:33.532 --> 35:34.731
- You!

35:34.766 --> 35:36.533
You stood me up and
you didn't even call.

35:38.270 --> 35:40.137
- Sweetie, I dropped
my phone in the ocean

35:40.239 --> 35:41.671
and a shark ate it.

35:42.741 --> 35:43.573
I miss you.

35:43.609 --> 35:45.308
Come on, sweetie, I miss us.

35:45.410 --> 35:47.444
- See right there,
that is the problem

35:47.546 --> 35:48.979
because there is no us.

35:49.081 --> 35:50.247
There's only brad.

35:51.416 --> 35:53.450
- I know, it's been hard for me

35:53.552 --> 35:57.254
and I'm still not use to
exposing myself to someone.

35:57.289 --> 35:59.556
- Literally, you know
you have problems.

35:59.591 --> 36:01.191
- Come on, sweetie.

36:01.226 --> 36:03.627
I know I've made mistakes and
I've really thought about it.

36:03.729 --> 36:06.930
And now I know, I
know what I want.

36:08.600 --> 36:09.566
I want you.

36:12.104 --> 36:14.504
- Brad, I'm not an asset.

36:14.606 --> 36:15.305
- Come on, sweetie.

36:15.407 --> 36:16.339
Let's travel the world.

36:16.441 --> 36:18.175
Let's live on an island.

36:18.277 --> 36:19.442
- No no no no no.

36:19.478 --> 36:21.878
You, you want to
live on an island.

36:21.914 --> 36:24.681
I like it here, I'm comfortable.

36:24.783 --> 36:25.649
- You're comfortable?

36:25.751 --> 36:26.750
In this dump?

36:27.986 --> 36:29.519
No, you're not.

36:29.621 --> 36:32.289
You're trapped and I'm
the guy that's holding

36:32.324 --> 36:33.757
that door wide open for you.

36:33.792 --> 36:35.058
- Oh yeah?

36:35.093 --> 36:35.926
If it's open, why
don't you go use it

36:35.961 --> 36:37.594
and just leave me alone, okay?

36:37.629 --> 36:39.896
I got a pug with a
personality disorder

36:39.932 --> 36:41.097
so I have to go.

36:41.133 --> 36:43.066
- Okay, can I call you?

36:43.101 --> 36:44.634
- From the belly of a shark.

36:44.670 --> 36:46.403
- (laughs) that's why
I love you, rachael.

36:46.438 --> 36:48.305
Princess. (laughs)

36:48.340 --> 36:49.906
merry christmas, sweetheart.

36:49.942 --> 36:51.241
- Merry christmas.

36:58.617 --> 37:02.986

heaven adored ♪

37:03.021 --> 37:07.457

37:19.171 --> 37:20.537
- [michael] sophia.

37:20.639 --> 37:21.938
(boys laughing)

37:21.974 --> 37:24.174
- I got this, everything okay.

37:24.209 --> 37:25.108
Hey!

37:30.682 --> 37:32.415
Come on, no laughing.

37:34.820 --> 37:35.986
- Come on, come on.

37:36.021 --> 37:37.687
Soph, come on, hun.

37:49.234 --> 37:50.467
Soph.

37:50.502 --> 37:52.435
- [sophia] I'm never
coming out, dad.

37:53.705 --> 37:56.006
- Come on, you were great.

37:56.842 --> 37:58.174
Nobody even noticed.

37:58.210 --> 38:00.977
- Oh see, you noticed.

38:01.013 --> 38:03.146
- Hey sophie, it's rachael.

38:03.181 --> 38:05.515
So you know, some of the most
successful people in life

38:05.550 --> 38:07.150
make the most mistakes.

38:08.353 --> 38:10.320
Because they are always trying

38:10.355 --> 38:13.490
and they use their mistakes
to make themselves better.

38:13.525 --> 38:18.628
So, if you messed up but
you gave it your all,

38:20.065 --> 38:22.032
well, then you've got
nothing to be ashamed of.

38:22.067 --> 38:24.801
You have to believe in yourself.

38:24.903 --> 38:27.337
I know I believe in you.

38:27.372 --> 38:28.838
- You do?

38:28.874 --> 38:30.040
- Yeah, I do.

38:35.580 --> 38:36.646
- Thank you.

38:42.554 --> 38:44.688
(michael chuckles)

38:48.427 --> 38:50.360
- what is a marsupial?

38:50.395 --> 38:51.361
Hey, thank you.

38:51.396 --> 38:52.629
I hear brad's back in town.

38:52.764 --> 38:54.064
- Shark ate his phone.

38:54.099 --> 38:55.699
- That makes perfect sense.

38:55.734 --> 38:56.833
Who is charles darwin?

38:56.935 --> 38:59.703
- [tv] who is charles darwin?

38:59.738 --> 39:00.570
- What did you say?

39:00.605 --> 39:01.404
- We're done.

39:01.440 --> 39:02.639
- Oh good.

39:02.741 --> 39:04.908
'cause it'd be very
strange me dating donna.

39:06.278 --> 39:10.046
- Dad, you know that she
just tolerates you, right?

39:10.082 --> 39:10.947
- No no.

39:12.250 --> 39:14.284
You know, you've been
on a playground, right?

39:14.319 --> 39:16.252
You know the way a girl
pretends not to like the boy

39:16.288 --> 39:17.387
so the boy likes her.

39:18.490 --> 39:21.424
Same concept, it's
classic doctor spock.

39:21.460 --> 39:22.392
- The vulcan?

39:23.428 --> 39:24.661
- Him too, mm-hm.

39:26.131 --> 39:29.933
Any man that doesn't treat
you like the queen of England,

39:29.968 --> 39:31.234
off with his head.

39:32.604 --> 39:33.403
(phone ringing)

39:33.438 --> 39:34.337
- oh.

39:36.108 --> 39:36.973
Hello.

39:37.943 --> 39:39.275
Oh, no, michael, it's me.

39:39.311 --> 39:40.243
I was just...

39:41.346 --> 39:43.079
- That prince charming.

39:43.115 --> 39:44.447
- [rachael] hi, yes.

39:44.483 --> 39:46.750
- Tell him to live
long and prosper.

39:46.785 --> 39:48.451
- [rachael] no, I haven't eaten.

39:48.487 --> 39:49.419
- Ooh!
- Yeah, yeah.

39:49.454 --> 39:50.487
I can come over for dinner.

39:50.522 --> 39:52.989
- What is an invertebrate?

39:54.025 --> 39:56.259
- No, veggies give her gas

39:56.294 --> 39:58.094
and I'm talking
silent but deadlies

39:58.130 --> 40:00.263
that'll coat your
nostrils for days.

40:01.833 --> 40:05.135
So, what are you gonna
do about rachael?

40:05.170 --> 40:07.971
- Well, she's not
speaking to me right now.

40:08.006 --> 40:10.173
- You think your father
and I always got along?

40:10.208 --> 40:11.141
- No.

40:12.177 --> 40:14.110
I mean, I'm not sure.

40:16.148 --> 40:18.348
- Has dennis sold the clinic?

40:18.383 --> 40:20.617
- He had a young doctor
looking at this afternoon.

40:20.652 --> 40:24.754
- Hm, any idea what
it's going for?

40:24.790 --> 40:25.722
- Two million.

40:27.192 --> 40:28.625
- Wow, you're kidding?

40:30.228 --> 40:32.996
Gee, another
millionaire in town.

40:33.832 --> 40:36.399
It's been so lonely on top.

40:41.373 --> 40:42.572
How long you staying?

40:43.708 --> 40:45.375
- I don't know,
maybe a couple weeks.

40:45.410 --> 40:48.378
- Oh good, I'm taking
a new years cruise.

40:48.413 --> 40:52.382
So you can stay and
watch mrs. Pickles.

40:53.218 --> 40:55.852
- [rachael] I literally can't
eat one more bite of this.

40:55.887 --> 40:57.053
- Emma's a really good cook.

40:57.088 --> 40:58.354
- [rachael] she really is.

40:58.390 --> 40:59.622
- Let me grab
these for you guys.

40:59.658 --> 41:01.024
- Thank you.
- Oh, I will help.

41:05.096 --> 41:06.196
- She's adorable.

41:07.232 --> 41:09.732
- Yeah, she says I smother her.

41:10.902 --> 41:14.637
- Okay, my dad says
the exact same thing.

41:14.673 --> 41:17.407
I don't think that would
call that smothering though.

41:17.442 --> 41:19.108
I mean, look, I get it.

41:19.211 --> 41:23.680
I'm a little protective,
but he's all I got.

41:23.715 --> 41:25.915
When I was young, he
would put us in the car

41:25.951 --> 41:27.684
and we would drive
around for hours

41:27.719 --> 41:29.652
with absolutely no
destination in mind.

41:29.754 --> 41:31.788
We would just go and explore

41:31.890 --> 41:35.291
and go rock hunting
and we'd go see caves.

41:35.393 --> 41:36.392
And we'd go on picnics.

41:36.428 --> 41:39.295
We'd do everything together.

41:39.397 --> 41:42.398
- Sounds to me like driving
wasn't the thing that he loved.

41:45.237 --> 41:47.804
- Yep, I never thought
about it like that.

41:49.708 --> 41:50.607
- To driving.

41:51.576 --> 41:52.609
- Here's to driving.

41:55.280 --> 42:00.383
♪ merry christmas, darling ♪

42:01.286 --> 42:04.554
♪ I heard you're doing well ♪

42:05.457 --> 42:08.324

46:27.152 --> 46:28.951
I want you to make sure
that she's all right

46:28.987 --> 46:32.388
because we have to find a
new home for her right away.

46:32.423 --> 46:33.656
- Yeah, why?

46:33.691 --> 46:35.625
- Because sadler came
back with an offer

46:35.660 --> 46:37.226
that was better
than we were hoping.

46:37.328 --> 46:38.694
- What?

46:38.797 --> 46:40.630
- Time for me to
do some traveling,

46:40.665 --> 46:43.966
and it's time for you to maybe
grow some wings of your own.

46:45.670 --> 46:48.137

closed for the holidays.

47:08.193 --> 47:12.461
- Could you please help my
dad in the back, please?

47:12.497 --> 47:13.996
- It's not what it looks like.

47:14.032 --> 47:15.331
It's mrs. Pickles.

47:15.366 --> 47:18.434

47:31.049 --> 47:35.484
Yeah, you know your mom brings
her in here all the time.

47:35.520 --> 47:38.087
She's got stomach issues.

47:38.223 --> 47:40.590
She's a chihuahua, it's normal.

47:40.692 --> 47:42.458
She's gonna be
okay, right cutie?

47:42.560 --> 47:43.392
- Okay.

47:44.562 --> 47:46.762
I just want her to be
as healthy as possible.

47:46.898 --> 47:48.931
I would be crushed if
something happened to her.

47:49.033 --> 47:51.067
- I won't anything
happen to her.

47:51.102 --> 47:52.368

52:02.153 --> 52:03.586
- No, you go first.

52:03.621 --> 52:05.020

52:05.156 --> 52:06.188
Okay.

52:42.793 --> 52:45.761

53:43.921 --> 53:45.321

53:50.728 --> 53:51.660

You mad?

54:05.276 --> 54:06.408

54:07.745 --> 54:08.844
- I can see that.

54:11.482 --> 54:13.082
- You could've told me.

54:13.117 --> 54:15.184
- I know, I know.

54:16.621 --> 54:17.519
I tried.

54:20.057 --> 54:21.523
You were just so happy.

54:23.594 --> 54:25.794
And I really didn't
wanna ruin that for you.

54:27.064 --> 54:28.197
- Well, it's gone now.

54:29.634 --> 54:30.866
I still have to
explain to sophie.

54:30.968 --> 54:32.334
- Explain what?

54:32.436 --> 54:33.769
- [emma] hey.

54:33.804 --> 54:35.838
- Hi, explain nothing.

54:36.641 --> 54:38.107
- Oh, okay.

54:38.142 --> 54:39.275
Well, I'm ready to go,

54:39.310 --> 54:41.777

54:41.812 --> 54:43.879

54:47.652 --> 54:48.884
- I'm gonna take you to that.

54:48.919 --> 54:50.986
- No no, I'll take her.

54:54.292 --> 54:55.224

54:56.494 --> 54:57.126
- [michael] okay,
I'll be right out.

54:57.161 --> 54:57.726
- All right.

55:05.803 --> 55:07.636
- Brad, I said no.

55:07.672 --> 55:10.072
You really should've
taken this ring.

55:10.174 --> 55:12.074
- Nu-uh, no, you hesitated.

55:12.176 --> 55:13.742
That means there's
a yes in there.

55:13.778 --> 55:15.944
You just need some time.

55:15.980 --> 55:18.380
- Brad, it looks so expensive.

55:18.516 --> 55:20.482
You should just
come and pick it up.

55:20.518 --> 55:23.218
- I can't, I'm
helping the pastor.

55:23.354 --> 55:25.654
- Really, doing what?

55:25.690 --> 55:27.389
- Refreshments.

55:27.491 --> 55:30.225
- Well, don't give
anyone food poisoning.

55:30.328 --> 55:31.660
(brad laughs)

55:31.696 --> 55:33.329

55:33.364 --> 55:35.497

Shoot!

55:38.836 --> 55:40.069
Oh boy, I gotta go.

55:41.706 --> 55:42.604
- Okay.

55:49.513 --> 55:51.347
Yeah, that is really big.

56:00.424 --> 56:03.192
And really fake.

56:03.227 --> 56:04.793
Ugh, brad.

56:08.432 --> 56:12.267
Oh, no no no.

56:12.370 --> 56:15.537
All right, we're just
gonna get you off.

56:15.573 --> 56:16.372
Come on.

56:16.407 --> 56:17.706

56:25.583 --> 56:27.116
and we'll get ready.

56:28.886 --> 56:31.987
Hey, look, about last night.

56:32.022 --> 56:34.289

56:34.392 --> 56:37.593
- Right, so I sort

56:37.628 --> 56:39.828
- Oh, really?

56:40.765 --> 56:42.464
With brad, that thing.

56:42.566 --> 56:46.468
- Yeah, I should've
told you about that.

56:46.570 --> 56:48.070
- No, no need.

56:48.105 --> 56:50.639
- Oh, but see, there's so
much more to the story.

56:50.775 --> 56:52.441
- Not to me.

56:52.476 --> 56:54.176
I actually heard
everything I need to hear.

56:54.278 --> 56:57.413
But thank you for
helping sophia.

56:58.282 --> 56:59.281
She's doing great.

57:00.618 --> 57:01.850
Be back in an hour.

57:01.952 --> 57:02.651
- Okay.

57:02.753 --> 57:04.052

57:04.088 --> 57:04.987

57:15.933 --> 57:18.066

57:18.836 --> 57:21.937

57:33.350 --> 57:34.283
- what's up?

57:36.320 --> 57:37.152
Whatcha doing?

57:42.026 --> 57:45.461
- When you're open, you can
never a real deep clean in.

57:45.496 --> 57:46.795
- On christmas eve?

57:48.365 --> 57:49.164
- It's therapy.

57:50.534 --> 57:51.366
- You wanna talk?

57:52.236 --> 57:53.302
- No.

57:53.337 --> 57:55.070
- [emma] you sure?

57:55.172 --> 57:56.004
- Yep.

57:57.341 --> 57:58.841
- Okay, I'm not gonna

57:58.876 --> 58:00.709
- You're gonna be
here a long time then.

58:07.885 --> 58:08.851
- I'm sorry.

58:10.721 --> 58:11.687
- It's okay.

58:12.890 --> 58:14.490
I'm just out of the dating game.

58:16.260 --> 58:17.159
Maybe for good.

58:18.562 --> 58:20.662
- Yeah, I get it.

58:20.698 --> 58:24.166
Again, I'm really sorry.

58:26.070 --> 58:27.002
- I'm good.

58:29.773 --> 58:30.506
A little help?

58:30.541 --> 58:31.373
- Me?

58:31.408 --> 58:32.508
- No.

58:32.543 --> 58:34.743
I have some last
minute shopping to do.

58:34.778 --> 58:36.245
- Must be nice to
be the boss, huh?

58:36.280 --> 58:37.546
(emma laughs)

58:37.581 --> 58:38.647
later.

58:38.749 --> 58:39.581
- [emma] later.

58:42.920 --> 58:45.087
- Nervous, that's
just really a given.

58:45.122 --> 58:46.355
- I know.

58:46.390 --> 58:47.155
- [sophia] I'm excited.

58:47.258 --> 58:48.090
- You are excited?

58:48.125 --> 58:49.324
Good, good.

59:02.406 --> 59:05.240
- Good, from the diaphragm.

59:05.276 --> 59:06.775
- You ready?

59:06.810 --> 59:07.543

59:32.836 --> 59:33.702

59:35.105 --> 59:36.705

59:36.807 --> 59:38.840
Rachael, I heard the news.

59:38.943 --> 59:40.075
Brad?

59:41.445 --> 59:43.245
Oh, it's gigantic.

59:44.181 --> 59:45.480
- I know, right?

59:46.350 --> 59:48.483
It's fake, yeah.

59:49.787 --> 59:50.552
Get this off.

59:53.157 --> 59:56.058
Please, just come off.

59:56.160 --> 59:57.225
Oh dad!
- I was just coming.

59:57.328 --> 59:58.594
- I just can't, please.
- What was going on?

59:58.629 --> 59:59.728
- Not now.

1:00:06.503 --> 1:00:07.469
- You wanna talk about it?

1:00:07.504 --> 1:00:09.271
- Dad, you're in
the ladies room.

1:00:10.641 --> 1:00:12.608
- Everybody, stay
where you are please.

1:00:12.643 --> 1:00:13.508
- Get off!

1:00:14.979 --> 1:00:15.844
- Let me see it.

1:00:17.982 --> 1:00:21.049
Oh, brad, do you love him?

1:00:21.151 --> 1:00:22.584
- Not like that!

1:00:22.686 --> 1:00:25.287
Oh dad, I made a
really big mistake.

1:00:26.190 --> 1:00:27.522
- Michael.

1:00:27.558 --> 1:00:28.457
- And I don't think there's
any way to win him back,

1:00:28.492 --> 1:00:30.626
and I can't stop thinking him.

1:00:30.661 --> 1:00:31.493
- Okay, okay.

1:00:31.528 --> 1:00:33.095
You're a smart woman, rachael.

1:00:33.197 --> 1:00:34.262
Just like your mother.

1:00:34.365 --> 1:00:35.197
And like your mother
you're gonna make

1:00:35.232 --> 1:00:36.732
the right decision, okay?

1:00:36.834 --> 1:00:39.034
You just follow your heart
and you can't go wrong.

1:00:39.069 --> 1:00:41.937
- Dad, you gotta get
out of the bathroom now.

1:00:42.039 --> 1:00:43.305
- Yeah, okay, okay.

1:00:46.844 --> 1:00:48.443
Try some dental floss around
the top of the finger.

1:00:48.545 --> 1:00:49.544
- Does it work?

1:00:49.580 --> 1:00:50.712
- Look it up.
- Okay.

1:00:57.087 --> 1:00:58.020
- Congratulations.

1:01:01.525 --> 1:01:04.059
- I need to talk to rachael.
Can I use your phone?

1:01:04.094 --> 1:01:05.494
- No.

1:01:05.529 --> 1:01:07.029
- I need to ask her something.

1:01:08.065 --> 1:01:09.665
- Come on, you have the song.

1:01:09.700 --> 1:01:10.866
You're gonna be fine.

1:01:10.901 --> 1:01:13.235
- No, dad, I have to
ask her something.

1:01:13.270 --> 1:01:14.202
- No.

1:01:14.238 --> 1:01:15.804
- [sophia] why not?

1:01:15.906 --> 1:01:16.905
- Because I said so.

1:01:18.442 --> 1:01:20.308
- You are acting a kid.

1:01:20.411 --> 1:01:24.379
- You don't need rachael
to sing better, all right?

1:01:25.716 --> 1:01:27.949
Can we just stop talking about
this? Please, I wanna eat.

1:01:28.052 --> 1:01:29.184
- Okay, you okay?

1:01:32.589 --> 1:01:33.655
- Yeah, why?

1:01:34.925 --> 1:01:37.592
- Okay, say it, don't spray it.

1:01:43.600 --> 1:01:45.000
- How you holding up?

1:01:45.102 --> 1:01:46.835
- Not working, not working.

1:01:50.274 --> 1:01:51.540
- You finally get what you want,

1:01:51.575 --> 1:01:53.275
and now you don't know
if you want it anymore.

1:01:53.310 --> 1:01:56.545
- I know that I want
this thing off my finger.

1:01:56.580 --> 1:01:58.146
- You call michael?

1:01:58.248 --> 1:01:59.214
- No.

1:02:00.951 --> 1:02:03.385
Dad, I don't know
what I'm gonna say.

1:02:05.789 --> 1:02:08.724
- Sounds to me like you've
already made up your mind.

1:02:08.759 --> 1:02:11.593
- Dad, it just happened so fast.

1:02:11.628 --> 1:02:12.561
- Love's a bullet, baby.

1:02:12.596 --> 1:02:14.396
Don't let it take you down.

1:02:17.167 --> 1:02:19.267
- Dad, I really hurt him.

1:02:23.307 --> 1:02:24.272
- He'll understand.

1:02:25.943 --> 1:02:29.578
- And what if he doesn't?

1:02:36.019 --> 1:02:36.885
- Do something.

1:02:38.155 --> 1:02:39.254
Tell him how you feel.

1:02:41.358 --> 1:02:42.290
Yeah?

1:02:43.794 --> 1:02:46.294
You're not gonna get him back
standing here talking to me.

1:02:50.334 --> 1:02:51.733
This...

1:02:51.835 --> 1:02:53.401
- Yeah.

1:02:53.504 --> 1:02:57.606
- Oof, try some coconut
oil on that, all right?

1:02:57.641 --> 1:02:59.007
- Coconut, okay.

1:03:01.545 --> 1:03:03.211
- Who loves you?

1:03:03.313 --> 1:03:04.146
- You.

1:03:05.549 --> 1:03:06.448
- I do.

1:03:19.363 --> 1:03:22.464
(soft somber music)

1:03:27.838 --> 1:03:28.870
- you okay?

1:03:33.377 --> 1:03:34.476
- I'm fine.

1:03:39.416 --> 1:03:41.817
- Do you remember
when we were kids

1:03:41.852 --> 1:03:44.820
how I use to break out in hives
every time we went camping?

1:03:46.256 --> 1:03:48.657
Mom and dad could not figure
out what I was allergic to

1:03:48.692 --> 1:03:50.692
and we had to leave the
campground every year

1:03:50.727 --> 1:03:51.960
and go get a hotel.

1:03:54.731 --> 1:03:57.332
About 10 years ago I
figured out what it was.

1:03:59.736 --> 1:04:00.669
Stress.

1:04:04.408 --> 1:04:06.441
And I'm sorry that
I wasn't there.

1:04:06.543 --> 1:04:08.410
I know when she died, that
was really hard on you,

1:04:08.445 --> 1:04:09.244
and I should've--

1:04:09.279 --> 1:04:10.812
- no no.

1:04:10.914 --> 1:04:12.681
No, look at me.

1:04:13.584 --> 1:04:14.516
I'm happy.

1:04:18.255 --> 1:04:19.087
Come here.

1:04:20.591 --> 1:04:21.656
I love you.

1:04:21.758 --> 1:04:22.691
- I love you, too.

1:04:25.062 --> 1:04:27.863
I forgot to set the
alarm at the cafe.

1:04:27.898 --> 1:04:29.397
So I'm gonna turn that off.

1:04:29.433 --> 1:04:30.765
- No no, I'll get it.

1:04:30.801 --> 1:04:31.566
- No.

1:04:31.602 --> 1:04:32.868
- Yeah yeah, listen.

1:04:32.903 --> 1:04:34.703
Please, go chill with sophie.

1:04:35.906 --> 1:04:38.006
The pageant's coming
up and she's like...

1:04:39.643 --> 1:04:41.243
She's says I'm
hovering over here.

1:04:41.278 --> 1:04:42.744
I make her nervous.

1:04:42.779 --> 1:04:43.678
- She said that?

1:04:43.780 --> 1:04:45.046
- Mm-hm.

1:04:45.082 --> 1:04:45.947
- Yeah, okay.

1:04:47.084 --> 1:04:48.416
- All right, cool,
I'll see you there.

1:04:48.452 --> 1:04:49.918
- Mm-hm, I'll see you.

1:04:49.953 --> 1:04:50.752
- [michael] bye.

1:04:50.787 --> 1:04:51.720
- Bye.

1:04:52.522 --> 1:04:53.922
St a little left.

1:04:53.957 --> 1:04:54.890
- [ellen] I got it!

1:04:54.925 --> 1:04:56.258
- Just a little bit more right.

1:04:56.293 --> 1:04:57.525
- I got it.

1:04:57.628 --> 1:04:59.127
- [pastor] just a
little bit right.

1:04:59.162 --> 1:05:01.263
(glass shatters)
- don't got it.

1:05:01.298 --> 1:05:02.230
I'll fix it.

1:05:03.600 --> 1:05:07.202
- It looks like maybe you
could use a little help.

1:05:07.304 --> 1:05:09.237
- I think you could more than I.

1:05:10.507 --> 1:05:15.043
- Yeah, I think I'm just gonna
cut the whole finger off.

1:05:15.145 --> 1:05:17.112
- I have shears in the
green shed if you wanna.

1:05:17.147 --> 1:05:18.113
- Oh okay.

1:05:19.816 --> 1:05:22.784
Look, can I ask you a question?

1:05:22.819 --> 1:05:24.452
- Always go with your instinct.

1:05:26.356 --> 1:05:28.056
- My dad said the
extra same thing.

1:05:28.158 --> 1:05:28.990
- Wise man.

1:05:30.327 --> 1:05:32.227
Look, whatever you decide,
just consider the fact

1:05:32.329 --> 1:05:35.497
that there are three people
affected by this decision.

1:05:35.532 --> 1:05:36.498
- Three?

1:05:36.533 --> 1:05:38.867
- You, michael, and brad.

1:05:38.969 --> 1:05:40.302
- [rachael] brad.

1:05:40.337 --> 1:05:41.469
- You may not wanna be with him,

1:05:41.505 --> 1:05:43.271
but you have to consider
his feelings too.

1:05:46.843 --> 1:05:51.913
- Yeah, and now on the
other hand, michael.

1:05:53.050 --> 1:05:56.418
Yeah, I don't think that
he's gonna forgive me.

1:05:56.520 --> 1:05:59.020
I mean, I lied to him.

1:05:59.056 --> 1:06:00.789
- Sounds like a pickle.

1:06:00.824 --> 1:06:03.692
- Pickle, mrs. Pickle,
she's so cute, right?

1:06:04.695 --> 1:06:05.393
- Who?

1:06:05.495 --> 1:06:07.495
- The dog, no?

1:06:07.531 --> 1:06:08.463
Nevermind.

1:06:10.567 --> 1:06:12.133
So, what do I do?

1:06:13.870 --> 1:06:16.771
- First, we start by being
honest with yourself.

1:06:16.873 --> 1:06:18.640
And then you go be
honest with them.

1:06:20.077 --> 1:06:24.946
- And what happens if
they both leave me?

1:06:26.049 --> 1:06:28.016
- Then neither one of
them was right for you.

1:06:28.051 --> 1:06:29.517
God works in mysterious ways.

1:06:31.054 --> 1:06:32.020
- Yes.

1:06:33.423 --> 1:06:35.657
You're good, you're good.

1:06:36.660 --> 1:06:38.793
- Actually I need some
refreshments picked up

1:06:38.895 --> 1:06:40.095
from brad's house.

1:06:40.197 --> 1:06:42.664
Might be a good time
to go clear the air?

1:06:45.435 --> 1:06:46.368
- Yeah.

1:06:47.904 --> 1:06:48.803
Okay.

1:06:50.874 --> 1:06:53.541
I really wish that I could
get this ring off my.

1:07:03.120 --> 1:07:04.219
- Mysterious ways.

1:07:19.403 --> 1:07:22.103
(doorbell rings)

1:07:25.776 --> 1:07:26.608
- [brad] rachael?

1:07:26.643 --> 1:07:28.143
- Hello brad.

1:07:28.245 --> 1:07:29.010
- [brad] what are
you doing here?

1:07:29.112 --> 1:07:30.145
- Okay, two things.

1:07:30.247 --> 1:07:32.113
One, I gotta pick
up the cookies.

1:07:32.149 --> 1:07:34.182
And number two, I
really wanna talk.

1:07:34.284 --> 1:07:36.618
- Yeah, well, the
last batch is cooking.

1:07:36.653 --> 1:07:37.719
Gingerbread men.

1:07:37.754 --> 1:07:39.320
- Oh, you made gingerbread men?

1:07:39.423 --> 1:07:40.455
- I did.

1:07:40.490 --> 1:07:41.589
And one of them attacked me

1:07:41.625 --> 1:07:43.758
and mrs. Pickles
barely saved my life.

1:07:43.794 --> 1:07:45.093
She gassed them out.

1:07:45.128 --> 1:07:46.461
- Oh stop.

1:07:46.496 --> 1:07:48.763
- Brad, who's at the door?

1:07:48.799 --> 1:07:50.598
Oh, rachael.

1:07:50.634 --> 1:07:51.699
- Hi donna.

1:07:51.802 --> 1:07:52.600
- Hi.

1:07:53.970 --> 1:07:56.938
Is dennis going to
the show tonight?

1:07:56.973 --> 1:07:58.440
- I suppose.

1:07:58.475 --> 1:08:00.742
- Well, I mean, not that I care.

1:08:00.777 --> 1:08:01.810
- Of course not.

1:08:01.845 --> 1:08:02.644
- Who said I did?

1:08:02.679 --> 1:08:03.945
- No one.

1:08:03.980 --> 1:08:05.647
- Well, there's a formal event,

1:08:05.682 --> 1:08:07.482
and I should get ready.

1:08:07.517 --> 1:08:09.484
I'd like to look my best,

1:08:09.519 --> 1:08:11.453
but not for anyone special.

1:08:11.488 --> 1:08:12.921
- Who would it be for?

1:08:12.956 --> 1:08:13.988
- No one.
- Yeah.

1:08:18.795 --> 1:08:20.128
- Rachael, sweetie.

1:08:20.163 --> 1:08:21.563
- Yeah, look, listen.

1:08:21.665 --> 1:08:24.766
Come here, I really wanna
talk to you about this

1:08:24.801 --> 1:08:27.902
because this has really been
weighing really heavy on me.

1:08:29.172 --> 1:08:33.942
And well, I can't marry you.

1:08:34.978 --> 1:08:38.113
- Oh, well why not?

1:08:38.148 --> 1:08:39.781
- I don't love you.

1:08:41.017 --> 1:08:43.218
- Okay, so then you hate me.

1:08:43.320 --> 1:08:47.088
- No, I don't hate you.

1:08:48.191 --> 1:08:49.424
We're good friends

1:08:49.526 --> 1:08:53.161
and we're really good
at being good friends.

1:08:53.196 --> 1:08:56.531
Just with no commitment.

1:08:56.566 --> 1:08:59.434
I mean, there's a
lot of love here.

1:08:59.536 --> 1:09:03.571
I'm just not in love with you.

1:09:03.673 --> 1:09:08.409
And, well, I finally
know the difference.

1:09:08.512 --> 1:09:10.445
- I get it, I do.

1:09:10.547 --> 1:09:14.649
- Look, despite everything
that we've been through,

1:09:15.752 --> 1:09:17.552
I really do think
you are gonna make

1:09:17.587 --> 1:09:19.821
an amazing husband some day.

1:09:20.724 --> 1:09:22.090
- No, no, I'm not.

1:09:22.192 --> 1:09:23.358
- [rachael] why?

1:09:23.393 --> 1:09:25.593
- You can keep the
ring, it's a fake.

1:09:25.695 --> 1:09:27.162
- Yeah, I know.

1:09:27.197 --> 1:09:28.997
(brad sighs)

1:09:29.032 --> 1:09:33.001
- and I wanted to marry
you because I'm broke.

1:09:33.036 --> 1:09:34.068
- [both women] what?

1:09:39.075 --> 1:09:42.544
- I made a bad business
investment with tony bruno.

1:09:44.881 --> 1:09:48.550
I borrowed $200,000 and if
I don't get it back to him,

1:09:48.585 --> 1:09:50.552
this will be my last christmas.

1:09:50.587 --> 1:09:52.554
- And why didn't you tell me?

1:09:52.589 --> 1:09:54.556
- Mom, because you're
always hovering around me.

1:09:54.591 --> 1:09:56.024
I mean, you're
always paying things.

1:09:56.059 --> 1:09:57.825
I need some space.

1:09:57.928 --> 1:10:01.062
The music festival was
gonna be my way out.

1:10:01.097 --> 1:10:02.764
But it flopped.

1:10:02.799 --> 1:10:04.632
And the artist
didn't even show up,

1:10:04.734 --> 1:10:07.569
and I had to refund
everybody's tickets.

1:10:10.473 --> 1:10:12.907
I'm sorry for everything.

1:10:12.943 --> 1:10:14.242
- I know, I know.

1:10:20.450 --> 1:10:21.649
(brad sighs)

1:10:21.751 --> 1:10:23.518
- all right, I'm gonna
go get the cookies.

1:10:23.620 --> 1:10:24.419
- Okay.

1:10:29.626 --> 1:10:33.861
- Well, I guess this is
the eve for coming clean.

1:10:34.931 --> 1:10:39.734
So, tell your father
to save a seat for moi.

1:10:47.310 --> 1:10:48.042
- Okay.

1:10:49.980 --> 1:10:51.546
- Excuse me.

1:10:51.648 --> 1:10:54.549
- [michael] sorry, we're
closed for christmas eve.

1:10:54.651 --> 1:10:57.085
- No, I'm not here for the food.

1:10:57.120 --> 1:10:59.320
Dennis, we meet the other night.

1:11:00.490 --> 1:11:01.256
- How are you, dennis?

1:11:01.291 --> 1:11:02.056
- How are you, man?

1:11:02.158 --> 1:11:03.558
- Good.

1:11:03.660 --> 1:11:06.261
- Do you have a second that
I could maybe talk to you?

1:11:06.296 --> 1:11:07.395
- Sure, have a seat.

1:11:07.497 --> 1:11:08.329
- Okay.

1:11:09.666 --> 1:11:10.531
Just take a minute.

1:11:10.634 --> 1:11:15.637
- [michael] sure.

1:11:17.874 --> 1:11:21.009
- I'm sure rachael's talked
to you about her mom.

1:11:21.044 --> 1:11:22.377
- Mm-hm.

1:11:22.479 --> 1:11:27.482
- Elizabeth, spectacular
woman, outstanding.

1:11:28.184 --> 1:11:29.250
Every much like rachael.

1:11:30.687 --> 1:11:34.722
Independent and resilient
and thick-headed, yeah?

1:11:34.824 --> 1:11:36.958
(laughs)

1:11:39.729 --> 1:11:43.431
when we met, she was engaged

1:11:43.533 --> 1:11:47.101
to the high school
quarterback star.

1:11:47.203 --> 1:11:50.371
He had a giant scholarship
to yale, right?

1:11:50.407 --> 1:11:52.974
I was this scrawny kid.

1:11:53.009 --> 1:11:54.876
I had no business picking
up the homecoming queen.

1:11:54.911 --> 1:11:56.978
Much less, bobby's
finance, right?

1:11:58.048 --> 1:12:01.816
But man, I was driven, you know?

1:12:03.053 --> 1:12:05.987
She really make me feel alive.

1:12:07.357 --> 1:12:09.324
I heard no a lot more
than I heard yes,

1:12:09.359 --> 1:12:14.162
but being the tenacious
son-of-a-gun that I am,

1:12:14.197 --> 1:12:19.300
I persisted and eventually I
stole her from bobby, right?

1:12:22.772 --> 1:12:23.705
- Dennis.

1:12:27.911 --> 1:12:29.310
I get it.

1:12:29.412 --> 1:12:30.912
- Okay.

1:12:30.947 --> 1:12:33.481
- But she didn't
tell me about brad,

1:12:33.583 --> 1:12:35.016
and I have to protect sophia.

1:12:36.453 --> 1:12:38.820
I've only dated one woman
since sophia's mom passed.

1:12:38.922 --> 1:12:43.558
And when things went
wrong and affected her,

1:12:44.794 --> 1:12:47.195
I just have to be really
careful right now.

1:12:47.230 --> 1:12:49.864
That's where I'm at, you
understand that, right?

1:12:51.634 --> 1:12:53.668
- Yes, and I commend
you for that.

1:12:53.770 --> 1:12:55.670
I mean, that was very honorable.

1:12:55.772 --> 1:12:59.574
But michael, everybody
make mistakes.

1:13:00.410 --> 1:13:03.745
She thought brad was long gone.

1:13:03.780 --> 1:13:05.913
And speaking for myself,

1:13:05.949 --> 1:13:08.883
I never thought he was in the
running in the first place.

1:13:10.120 --> 1:13:11.652
All right, I know I'm rambling.

1:13:11.755 --> 1:13:13.187
Dennis, come on,
get to the point.

1:13:13.289 --> 1:13:17.925
Okay, the real test of
love is forgiveness.

1:13:20.263 --> 1:13:22.263
Can you forgive her
for what she did?

1:13:22.298 --> 1:13:24.866
Because I've never seen her
act the way she's acting

1:13:24.968 --> 1:13:26.234
around another man.

1:13:26.269 --> 1:13:29.203
And michael, that
makes you special.

1:13:32.308 --> 1:13:33.474
That's my whole spiel.

1:13:37.147 --> 1:13:38.479
(michael sighs)

1:13:38.515 --> 1:13:39.981
- and I appreciate you.

1:13:40.016 --> 1:13:43.317
- All right, thanks for taking
a minute to listen to me.

1:13:44.120 --> 1:13:45.253
- Merry christmas.

1:13:45.288 --> 1:13:46.254
- Merry christmas.

1:13:58.968 --> 1:14:01.636
(michael sighs)

1:14:09.879 --> 1:14:13.114
(church bell ringing)

1:14:23.893 --> 1:14:25.393

1:14:25.428 --> 1:14:26.327
- Thanks.

1:14:26.362 --> 1:14:28.329
- [emma] how you feeling?

1:14:28.364 --> 1:14:29.464
- Like I'm gonna mess up.

1:14:29.566 --> 1:14:31.299
- You're not gonna mess up.

1:14:31.401 --> 1:14:33.334
You just have to remember
everything you learned.

1:14:33.369 --> 1:14:34.869
- [rachael] sophia.

1:14:34.904 --> 1:14:35.837
- Rachael.

1:14:37.574 --> 1:14:40.708
- I just wanted
to say go get 'em.

1:14:40.743 --> 1:14:42.877
Yeah, you're gonna
be great out there.

1:14:44.214 --> 1:14:45.079
How you doing?

1:14:46.583 --> 1:14:47.982
- I'm still nervous.

1:14:48.084 --> 1:14:51.919
- Yeah, well,
listen, just breath

1:14:51.955 --> 1:14:54.422
and remember when
it gets to that e,

1:14:55.258 --> 1:14:57.225

1:14:57.260 --> 1:14:58.192
Yeah, okay.

1:14:58.228 --> 1:15:00.261
And one thing I didn't tell you,

1:15:01.431 --> 1:15:03.197
you have to always
sing from here.

1:15:04.767 --> 1:15:05.666
- Thank you.

1:15:05.768 --> 1:15:07.068
- Yeah.

1:15:07.103 --> 1:15:09.337
Okay, go break a leg.

1:15:09.439 --> 1:15:10.271
- Okay.

1:15:12.976 --> 1:15:15.042
- She's amazing.

1:15:15.078 --> 1:15:18.212
- She is.

1:15:18.248 --> 1:15:19.580
So was my brother.

1:15:26.089 --> 1:15:29.557
(peaceful festive music)

1:15:45.141 --> 1:15:47.108
- if everyone could
take their seats for me.

1:15:47.143 --> 1:15:48.943
Thank you, thank you.

1:15:48.978 --> 1:15:50.511
We wanna thank you

1:15:50.613 --> 1:15:51.712

1:15:51.814 --> 1:15:53.881

extremely hard on this,

and we're ready to put

1:15:55.818 --> 1:15:56.984

I just wanna say

1:18:37.480 --> 1:18:39.413
that that was so wonderful.

1:18:39.449 --> 1:18:40.848
Thank you, young lady.

1:18:40.950 --> 1:18:43.884
- Yeah, and you know, I have
not had chills like that

1:18:43.986 --> 1:18:46.253
since luciano pavarotti.

1:18:46.289 --> 1:18:49.690
And his voice did things.

1:18:49.792 --> 1:18:52.159
- I actually have
all his albums.

1:18:52.195 --> 1:18:54.028
- Oh, you do?

1:18:54.130 --> 1:18:55.563
- Michael pryor?

1:18:56.666 --> 1:18:59.734
I'm sorry, is michael
pryor still here?

1:18:59.836 --> 1:19:01.268
Oh, there you are.

1:19:01.304 --> 1:19:02.636
Okay, you're here, hi.

1:19:03.840 --> 1:19:08.509
Hi, sophie, that was a
great job by the way.

1:19:10.980 --> 1:19:11.812
Yeah.

1:19:13.516 --> 1:19:15.816
Woo, it's really hot
in here, isn't it?

1:19:15.852 --> 1:19:16.817
Kinda a little hot.

1:19:18.054 --> 1:19:20.321
I'm up here having
to say something

1:19:20.356 --> 1:19:25.025
and I realized I am making
a fool out of myself.

1:19:25.061 --> 1:19:26.360
It's kind of embarrassing.

1:19:27.663 --> 1:19:29.730
Michael, I lied and I hurt you.

1:19:29.832 --> 1:19:31.465
And you don't deserve it.

1:19:32.702 --> 1:19:37.805
And well, what I
wanna say to you

1:19:38.674 --> 1:19:42.009
is that this happened so fast

1:19:42.044 --> 1:19:45.379
and this was just so unexpected.

1:19:46.849 --> 1:19:51.385
You know, what I realized
is that I have been in love

1:19:52.255 --> 1:19:54.522
with an idea of something.

1:19:54.557 --> 1:19:58.325
I didn't even know what
it was until I met you.

1:19:59.695 --> 1:20:04.632
From the moment we met, you
have just lifted up my heart,

1:20:05.868 --> 1:20:09.203
and I have not been
on solid ground since.

1:20:11.073 --> 1:20:12.406
It's really beautiful.

1:20:14.410 --> 1:20:15.876
And it's really scary.

1:20:18.915 --> 1:20:20.714
And I think the most
terrifying thing

1:20:20.750 --> 1:20:22.383
would just be that if you left

1:20:22.418 --> 1:20:27.354
and I didn't say I am so sorry.

1:20:32.795 --> 1:20:34.795
I am so sorry.

1:20:34.897 --> 1:20:38.265
(uplifting music)

1:20:38.301 --> 1:20:41.368
(crowd applauding)

1:20:44.907 --> 1:20:46.574
- a wise man once told me

1:20:46.609 --> 1:20:49.910
that a true test of
love is forgiveness.

1:20:53.115 --> 1:20:54.448
- A wise man, huh?

1:20:54.483 --> 1:20:55.382
- Mm-hm.

1:20:56.285 --> 1:20:58.018
He's always meddling.

1:20:58.120 --> 1:21:00.921
(michael chuckles)

1:21:05.795 --> 1:21:09.563
(singing in foreign language)

1:21:15.771 --> 1:21:18.038
- tony, relax, I'm
getting ya the money.

1:21:18.140 --> 1:21:21.141
My mom's gonna cut a
check tomorrow morning.

1:21:21.177 --> 1:21:22.109
Right when she...

1:21:25.181 --> 1:21:26.013
Oh, hold on, tony.

1:21:26.115 --> 1:21:26.947
Hold on, hold on.

1:21:29.151 --> 1:21:30.751
- Well, hello there.

1:21:30.786 --> 1:21:33.487
I hear you're the business
of promoting concerts.

1:21:33.522 --> 1:21:37.191
- Well, I'm not sure
I'm very good at it.

1:21:37.293 --> 1:21:40.494
- Well, have you ever thought
of promoting a concert

1:21:40.529 --> 1:21:42.062
at the north pole?

1:21:42.164 --> 1:21:44.164
- Wow, when?

1:21:44.200 --> 1:21:45.699
- Tomorrow night.

1:21:45.801 --> 1:21:49.003
You get me a super star, and
I'll get you enough money

1:21:49.038 --> 1:21:50.471
to pay off tony.

1:21:50.506 --> 1:21:53.340
- (laughs) yes, thank you.

1:21:53.376 --> 1:21:54.842
- You're welcome, brad.

1:21:54.877 --> 1:21:56.143
I'll just finish up here,

1:21:56.178 --> 1:21:57.778
and I'll see myself out.

1:21:57.813 --> 1:21:59.346
Merry christmas, brad.

1:21:59.382 --> 1:22:01.448
- Merry christmas.

1:22:01.484 --> 1:22:03.017
Tony, you're not gonna believe

1:22:03.052 --> 1:22:04.985
who's in my living
room right now.

1:22:10.393 --> 1:22:11.292
- Thanks.

1:22:23.039 --> 1:22:24.471
- There's strawberries in there.

1:22:24.507 --> 1:22:25.773
- And todd.

1:22:25.875 --> 1:22:26.640
- Todd.

1:22:28.711 --> 1:22:29.643
- Oh, that smells delicious.

1:22:29.679 --> 1:22:30.477
- So yummy.

1:22:30.513 --> 1:22:31.812

1:22:34.083 --> 1:22:35.282
- Of course, thank

1:22:35.384 --> 1:22:36.116
