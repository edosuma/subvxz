The servant of god Michael is baptized.

01:44.537 --> 01:50.373
SON OF SOFIA

03:22.969 --> 03:24.800
I prefer your hair down.

03:27.473 --> 03:28.872
Yes, but it's too hot.

03:33.913 --> 03:35.471
Did you bring the DVDs?

03:35.648 --> 03:36.774
Yes.

03:38.451 --> 03:39.850
There must be a lot.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.278
60.

03:41.454 --> 03:42.250
50!

03:42.422 --> 03:44.356
30 per year.

03:44.691 --> 03:45.817
Right...

03:47.727 --> 03:51.458
I asked a friend
to send us the new episodes.

03:51.831 --> 03:53.230
Which friend?

03:53.399 --> 03:56.926
You don't know him. He transferred
to our school after you left.

04:07.380 --> 04:09.644
He's expecting your new address.

04:11.851 --> 04:13.648
Why did you move?

04:16.822 --> 04:20.315
I had to move in with a gentleman
I was hired to look after.

04:21.293 --> 04:22.454
It's only temporary.

04:22.929 --> 04:26.228
He had a mild stroke when his wife died.

04:56.963 --> 04:58.828
I thought it'd be you and me.

05:00.533 --> 05:02.398
It won't make a big difference.

05:48.548 --> 05:51.984
The Greek Olympic Games mascot Phoebos
was named afterApollo-Phoebos,

05:52.585 --> 05:56.521
the god of light, prophecy, and music.

05:58.858 --> 06:03.921
Mascot Athena was named afterAthena,
the goddess of wisdom.

06:04.731 --> 06:08.326
Sofia is Greek for wisdom.
Sofia, same as your mother.

06:25.651 --> 06:28.711
How about you, son?
Do you know who you were named after?

06:32.792 --> 06:35.522
Yes, after Misha, the bear.

06:41.100 --> 06:42.829
Who's Misha the bear?

06:44.103 --> 06:46.071
The Moscow Olympic Games mascot.

06:47.940 --> 06:50.465
Whatever gave him that idea?

06:52.412 --> 06:54.642
It's something his dad used to say...

06:54.814 --> 06:57.544
We called him teddy bear
when he was little.

06:59.519 --> 07:03.853
Tell him he was wrong.
He was named afterArchangel Michael.

07:38.524 --> 07:40.458
Is Mr. Nikos very rich?

07:40.626 --> 07:41.558
No.

07:42.695 --> 07:44.856
All he has is this apartment.

07:50.002 --> 07:51.697
How many rooms?

07:53.873 --> 07:57.536
There's the dining room, living room,
kitchen, two bathrooms,

07:58.778 --> 08:03.044
Mr. Nikos' bedroom, yours, and mine.

08:03.783 --> 08:04.943
Eight in total.

08:12.725 --> 08:13.885
You can turn around.

08:15.928 --> 08:17.657
I got the sizes all wrong.

08:18.531 --> 08:20.123
I have to replace everything.

08:23.236 --> 08:24.669
Whose are these?

08:25.705 --> 08:27.673
They're new I just bought them.

08:35.715 --> 08:37.683
So, where's your room?

08:39.986 --> 08:42.682
Top of the corridor, to your left.

08:44.790 --> 08:49.193
Jack started to climb down the beanstalk
as fast as he could.

08:49.862 --> 08:53.730
When he touched the ground,
he sawthe giant coming after him.

09:41.781 --> 09:42.873
Mum?

09:45.751 --> 09:46.809
Mum?

09:47.587 --> 09:48.781
Are you asleep?

09:49.689 --> 09:51.213
You forgot the DVDs.

10:43.376 --> 10:45.207
Yes, I found them in the morning.

10:46.946 --> 10:48.607
I putthem in my room.

10:49.882 --> 10:51.645
We'll watch them when I get back.

10:55.421 --> 10:57.753
No, I couldn't hear you, I was asleep.

10:59.058 --> 11:00.389
No, I won't be late.

11:02.061 --> 11:04.052
Do as Mr. Nikos says, 0K?

11:05.064 --> 11:07.055
He'll take you to replace the clothes.

11:08.734 --> 11:10.634
I have to go now Talk to you later.

11:10.870 --> 11:11.768
Bye!

11:17.176 --> 11:18.302
What's up?

11:20.746 --> 11:23.237
Misha brought
some old Poor Vera episodes on DVD.

11:24.050 --> 11:25.039
What for?

11:25.718 --> 11:28.016
So you can watch them again together?

11:28.754 --> 11:29.413
Yes.

11:31.457 --> 11:33.823
I had no idea he liked it.

11:34.293 --> 11:37.922
Bring him overto my place
next time there's a new episode on.

11:41.834 --> 11:44.166
Misha doesn't know
I've already seen them.

11:45.938 --> 11:48.338
He called me every week for two years,

11:48.708 --> 11:51.836
to catch me up on the show.

11:52.378 --> 11:55.074
Inevertold him
you had a satellite dish.

11:56.115 --> 11:57.207
I see...

12:08.494 --> 12:09.893
You know what?

12:11.130 --> 12:14.156
I'd love to watchthem again too!

12:15.401 --> 12:18.029
Maybel should come over one evening.

12:19.138 --> 12:21.868
And finally meet your husband

12:22.174 --> 12:23.368
and Misha.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.872
I'll pretend I haven't seen them!

13:32.511 --> 13:35.776
Greek lesson No. 1.

13:36.348 --> 13:37.815
The family.

13:38.117 --> 13:41.917
Afamily consists of the father,

13:42.521 --> 13:44.045
the mother,

13:44.223 --> 13:48.853
the siblings, the grandparents,
the uncles,

13:50.229 --> 13:53.858
the brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law,

13:54.033 --> 13:57.059
the cousins once removed,

13:57.570 --> 14:00.300
and other kinfolk.

14:01.307 --> 14:03.537
Let's examine each one in detail.

14:07.146 --> 14:12.812
My father was Michael Benakis,

14:13.285 --> 14:15.253
Michael, just like you!

14:17.623 --> 14:19.887
General!

14:25.865 --> 14:27.492
General!

14:31.437 --> 14:33.132
Your father

14:33.572 --> 14:36.439
was Boris And reyev,

14:36.609 --> 14:40.010
but from now on,
I'm going to be yourfather.

14:40.546 --> 14:45.176
I'm going to be yourfather.

14:46.051 --> 14:49.282
Let's try and write this word down.

14:55.995 --> 14:57.257
"Fa...

15:01.533 --> 15:03.057
ther."

15:12.011 --> 15:14.172
"Fa-ther."

15:15.014 --> 15:16.106
Nowyou try it!

15:18.050 --> 15:22.043
Never write with your left hand.

15:22.221 --> 15:25.315
Right hand only!

15:30.529 --> 15:32.520
In the name of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin,

15:33.065 --> 15:36.501
in the presence of my comrades
I do solemnly swear

15:36.669 --> 15:38.296
to love my Motherland dearly,

15:38.470 --> 15:41.268
to live in a manner
bequeathed by the great Lenin

15:41.440 --> 15:43.305
and taught by the Communist Party,

15:43.475 --> 15:46.273
and to hold sacred the Laws
ofthe Pioneers ofthe Soviet Union.

15:46.445 --> 15:47.639
I, Misha Romanov,

15:48.013 --> 15:49.947
a young pioneer of the USSR...

15:50.115 --> 15:51.605
This is Vera Stepanova.

15:53.519 --> 15:55.214
And this is her son Misha.

16:03.429 --> 16:05.920
Vera told Misha she's expecting a baby.

16:06.398 --> 16:09.060
In a few months,
Misha will have a brother,

16:10.135 --> 16:12.160
a half-brother.

16:13.005 --> 16:15.098
Since Misha's father died years ago.

16:15.274 --> 16:19.040
Pioneer, be ready to defend
the Communist Party of the Soviet Union!

16:19.211 --> 16:20.371
Always ready!

16:20.546 --> 16:24.482
To think Vera's previous husband
was so much younger than her new one!

16:24.984 --> 16:27.316
Enough with the communist invasion
for today!

16:28.120 --> 16:29.212
Off to bed!

16:33.425 --> 16:34.551
Goodnight.

16:37.062 --> 16:38.359
Don't turn it off.

16:41.633 --> 16:43.464
Will you lie down with me?

17:15.099 --> 17:17.500
I don't like these clothes.

17:31.216 --> 17:34.413
Sleep,

17:36.588 --> 17:40.080
My beautiful good boy

17:42.194 --> 17:48.429
Bayushki bayu

17:50.636 --> 17:58.304
Quietly the moon is looking

17:59.511 --> 18:04.414
Into your bed

18:06.819 --> 18:14.658
I will tell you fairy tales...

19:39.211 --> 19:41.771
What were you doing
in Michael's room for so long?

19:42.347 --> 19:44.645
He doesn't need so much pampering.

19:44.816 --> 19:45.908
He's a man!

19:46.919 --> 19:47.886
I was taking a shower.

19:49.922 --> 19:51.549
Did you turn offthe boiler?

19:52.758 --> 19:53.622
Yes.

19:57.763 --> 20:00.357
Panayiotis called
for tomorrow's TV shoot.

20:01.233 --> 20:03.531
I'll take Michael with me.

20:04.436 --> 20:06.563
Some discipline will do him good.

20:09.541 --> 20:11.202
Little Red Riding Hood:

20:11.944 --> 20:14.845
Once upon a time,
a pretty little country girl

20:15.214 --> 20:17.682
lived in the woods with her mother.

20:18.450 --> 20:20.441
Everyone called her
Little Red Riding Hood

20:20.619 --> 20:22.587
for she refused
to part with her red cap.

20:25.357 --> 20:26.517
Tell me something!

20:27.326 --> 20:30.318
Didn't you and Sofia
also meet on a TV shoot?

20:30.495 --> 20:31.792
That's rig ht.

20:31.964 --> 20:33.363
What were you shooting?

20:33.799 --> 20:35.289
A restaurant scene.

20:35.734 --> 20:36.860
That's the best kind!

20:37.236 --> 20:39.534
You spend the whole day
eating and drinking!

20:39.705 --> 20:41.696
The National Youth Organization

20:41.873 --> 20:45.274
was established
by Governor loannis Metaxas,

20:46.411 --> 20:48.572
and is one of the more radical changes

20:48.747 --> 20:51.307
of the National Renaissance
of August 4th 1936.

20:51.483 --> 20:57.251
Sometimes, we fall asleep
to yourfairy tales at night.

20:59.992 --> 21:01.789
Will you give me an autograph?

21:05.731 --> 21:08.393
The Fairytales of Grandpa Earth

21:14.406 --> 21:16.340
Thanks so much!
- You're welcome.

21:21.747 --> 21:24.944
Are you going on holiday this summer?

21:25.984 --> 21:28.885
Why leave when the Olympics
are coming to town?

21:29.588 --> 21:31.681
I'm taking Michael
to every sporting event.

21:31.857 --> 21:34.519
You're rig ht, it's a historic moment.

21:36.361 --> 21:38.989
Whose picture are you taking?
We'll get yelled at.

21:39.364 --> 21:40.558
The leading lady's.

21:41.333 --> 21:42.425
It's for my mum.

21:43.302 --> 21:44.530
She's a big fan.

21:49.841 --> 21:51.035
Where are you from?

21:52.077 --> 21:53.408
From Ukraine.

21:54.079 --> 21:56.570
Little Michael's country?
- No, he's Russian.

21:56.848 --> 21:59.817
No way!
- Russia, Ukraine, same difference!

22:01.520 --> 22:02.714
What's your name?

22:02.888 --> 22:03.855
Misha.

22:04.022 --> 22:04.954
Michael!

22:09.461 --> 22:10.485
I'm Victor.

22:12.564 --> 22:15.533
Little Michael doesn't speak
any Greek yet, does he?

22:15.701 --> 22:18.465
He will soon.
I'm giving him intensive lessons.

22:18.637 --> 22:19.535
Is there a doctor in the house?

22:19.705 --> 22:20.637
Yes, right here!

22:20.806 --> 22:21.602
Break a leg!

22:28.613 --> 22:29.739
Are you married?

22:32.851 --> 22:34.079
Do you have a pen?

22:35.454 --> 22:40.949
King, homeland, religion, and family:

22:41.126 --> 22:42.821
These are the cornerstones

22:42.994 --> 22:45.827
of the National Youth Organization.

22:56.875 --> 22:57.967
Call me, if you need to!

22:58.143 --> 23:00.634
Let's do one more take!
Ready and... action!

23:35.480 --> 23:39.940
Misha hasn't fallen asleep yet.
He's going to hear us.

24:08.880 --> 24:10.438
Aren't you doing mine?

24:10.615 --> 24:11.673
You're just a kid.

24:12.551 --> 24:15.179
No one will notice
if your clothes are creased.

24:20.992 --> 24:22.186
I want to go with you.

24:22.561 --> 24:23.755
You can't.

24:24.763 --> 24:26.424
You'll stay home with Mr. Nikos.

24:26.598 --> 24:28.725
I don't want to live here anymore.

24:28.900 --> 24:30.492
We talked about this before.

24:30.669 --> 24:33.137
Enough already!
You're giving me a headache!

24:33.505 --> 24:36.167
It's impolite to speak a language
I don't understand.

24:37.042 --> 24:38.509
We have to stay a while.

24:45.684 --> 24:46.673
Just a minute!

24:46.852 --> 24:48.183
I'll be late for work.

25:01.867 --> 25:07.464
He longed to fill his stomach
with the pods the pigs were eating,

25:07.839 --> 25:09.739
but no one gave him any.

25:10.008 --> 25:14.138
That's when the prodigal son said,
"I'll go back to my father."

25:14.913 --> 25:19.145
The father called his servants and said,

25:20.151 --> 25:23.951
"Bring me the fattened calf!"

25:30.128 --> 25:35.156
"This son of mine was dead
and is alive again."

25:35.700 --> 25:38.828
"He was lost and is found."

27:58.777 --> 28:00.244
Five Olympic Rings.

28:00.745 --> 28:05.273
Five merging continents celebrating
the return of the Olympic Games

28:05.450 --> 28:07.077
to their country of origin.

28:26.271 --> 28:29.866
Stop snacking.
We're going to sit down to dinner soon.

28:31.342 --> 28:34.004
Can't you see
you've been putting on weight?

28:37.882 --> 28:39.247
Why did you stop eating?

28:40.819 --> 28:42.081
I'm not hungry any more.

28:43.855 --> 28:45.720
How long is this going to last?

28:46.958 --> 28:48.152
About three hours.

28:49.094 --> 28:51.392
When are we going to watch Poor Vera?

28:54.199 --> 28:55.689
We're not. Not today.

29:01.773 --> 29:05.300
Nine-year-old Michael
in his paper boat...

29:05.477 --> 29:09.811
Sturdy, like little old Greece,
no biggerthan a dot on the map...

29:09.981 --> 29:12.313
His name is Michael, just like you!

29:14.919 --> 29:16.784
Is Mr. Nikos an actor?

29:17.021 --> 29:17.988
No.

29:18.523 --> 29:20.081
What did he do before?

29:21.292 --> 29:25.251
He used to be a headmaster.
He also had a TV show for kids.

29:25.430 --> 29:28.957
Stop speaking that language
or he'll never learn Greek.

29:29.334 --> 29:32.064
Everything I taught him
will go down the drain.

29:34.038 --> 29:35.335
Where's your wedding ring?

29:36.174 --> 29:37.971
I left it at work.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.108
You left it at work?

29:40.278 --> 29:41.472
Yes.

29:43.948 --> 29:45.347
What about his wife?

29:45.850 --> 29:47.181
She was a housewife.

29:48.353 --> 29:49.377
No kids?

29:49.554 --> 29:50.418
None.

29:50.789 --> 29:54.156
How come?
- I don't know Why all the questions?

30:00.064 --> 30:01.429
How old is he?

30:03.902 --> 30:05.369
68... 69...

30:06.304 --> 30:08.295
Grand pa is 62.

30:51.082 --> 30:54.518
Young man,
there are rules in this house.

30:55.854 --> 30:58.414
Since you don't seem to get it,

30:58.590 --> 31:01.058
someone has to spell it out foryou.

31:02.060 --> 31:05.257
And if your motherwon't, then I will!

31:27.085 --> 31:28.052
Misha, open up!

31:29.020 --> 31:30.351
What's going on?

31:30.955 --> 31:32.354
Please open the door!

31:36.895 --> 31:38.055
How about some pelmeni?

31:38.229 --> 31:39.526
Stop speaking that language!

31:39.898 --> 31:41.490
I have all the ingredients.

31:41.666 --> 31:45.033
We're in Greece! Speak Greek!
Or must I learn Russian?

31:45.203 --> 31:47.330
Mr. Nikos is a good man.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.169
How about oladushki?

31:50.341 --> 31:52.036
Sofia, this is infuriating!

31:52.210 --> 31:54.144
Just tell me what you want me to cook!

31:54.312 --> 31:55.336
Sofia, what did I say?

31:55.513 --> 31:58.380
Misha, I'm sorry!
I should have explained.

31:59.083 --> 32:00.880
Stop it!

32:16.134 --> 32:18.500
It's not Mr. Nikos' fault.

32:22.073 --> 32:23.540
He's only trying to help.

32:26.945 --> 32:29.971
We got married right before you came.

32:30.481 --> 32:35.043
I tried to tell you but couldn't.

32:44.462 --> 32:47.431
I just told him we're married,
he didn't know

33:05.550 --> 33:07.541
Misha, I did it for you!

33:12.056 --> 33:14.217
OthenNise,
you'd have had to wait longer.

33:20.031 --> 33:21.157
Open up!

33:27.171 --> 33:29.162
Now you know everything!

33:33.011 --> 33:36.105
I couldn't bear living without you.

33:38.449 --> 33:40.110
Misha, open up!

33:43.087 --> 33:45.021
Please, open up.

34:07.645 --> 34:11.308
Sleep,

34:12.817 --> 34:16.446
My beautiful good boy

34:17.722 --> 34:23.627
Bayushki bayu

34:29.167 --> 34:37.666
Quietly the moon is looking

34:39.277 --> 34:44.476
Into your bed

34:50.188 --> 34:55.420
I will tell you fairy tales

34:55.860 --> 34:59.557
And sing you little songs

35:01.566 --> 35:07.095
But you must dream

35:07.271 --> 35:11.207
With your little eyes closed

35:12.877 --> 35:18.247
The time will come when you will learn

35:18.616 --> 35:22.484
The soldier's way of life

35:24.188 --> 35:29.455
Boldly you'll place your foot
into the stirrup

35:29.760 --> 35:33.389
And take the gun

35:35.600 --> 35:40.594
While preparing for the dangerous battle

35:41.339 --> 35:45.298
Please remember your mother

35:46.577 --> 35:52.209
Sleep, good boy, my beautiful

36:09.367 --> 36:14.634
I will die of yearning

36:14.939 --> 36:18.898
Inconsolably waiting for your return

36:20.611 --> 36:26.174
I'll pray the whole daylong

36:26.450 --> 36:30.318
And when night comes,
I'll dream of where you are.

36:31.756 --> 36:37.388
I'll worry that you're in trouble

36:37.695 --> 36:41.563
Far away in a strange land

36:43.334 --> 36:48.601
Sleep now and know no sorrows

39:33.371 --> 39:37.535
This is the ?rst golden metal
for the Greek Olympic team!

40:12.843 --> 40:14.777
These old dudes are so horny,

40:15.446 --> 40:18.108
they don't notice I take photos
while I fuck them.

40:19.583 --> 40:20.572
Isn't it a hoot?

40:29.760 --> 40:30.624
Yes...

40:32.430 --> 40:33.795
Once you start,

40:34.698 --> 40:37.496
it's hard to give up.

40:38.169 --> 40:40.069
You begin to like it.

40:42.740 --> 40:44.469
You'll see foryourself

40:44.642 --> 40:46.007
if you get into it...

40:48.446 --> 40:50.004
Does your mum knoiAf?

40:50.981 --> 40:53.643
She wouldn't give a crap.

40:54.485 --> 40:57.852
As long as I don't ask herformoney,

40:58.923 --> 41:01.187
she doesn't care what! Do.

41:07.665 --> 41:10.657
Besides, I'm only doing it for her.

41:12.536 --> 41:13.764
Where is she?

41:16.841 --> 41:19.776
She was here,
but she moved to Italy with some guy.

41:23.814 --> 41:25.179
Is that hers?

41:33.257 --> 41:34.690
Yes.

41:39.797 --> 41:41.822
But me, I'm not going anywhere!

41:42.900 --> 41:44.959
I've got my training.

41:45.135 --> 41:46.693
I'll get Greek citizenship,

41:47.037 --> 41:50.029
I'll qualify forthe next Olympics,
and go to Beijing!

41:53.110 --> 41:55.010
How will you get by on your own?

41:55.179 --> 41:57.613
I hadn't thought about it.

42:03.254 --> 42:05.814
I'll help you out at first.

42:07.725 --> 42:10.057
Worst case scenario,
you can always go back.

42:11.161 --> 42:14.187
The old man's probably loaded,
if your mum's with him.

42:15.699 --> 42:16.961
Are they married?

42:18.736 --> 42:20.704
She just works for him.

42:27.645 --> 42:29.237
Where is yourdad?

42:29.880 --> 42:30.904
Someplace.

42:31.148 --> 42:32.046
Where?

42:32.216 --> 42:33.706
Someplace!

42:40.090 --> 42:41.648
Any brothers or sisters?

42:41.825 --> 42:42.814
How about you?

42:44.028 --> 42:45.086
Nope.

42:45.262 --> 42:47.196
What about your dad? Where is he?

42:49.099 --> 42:52.626
I'm closer to you
than I everwas to my real brother.

42:53.270 --> 42:56.034
Moms and dads, and brothers and sisters,

42:56.740 --> 42:58.537
it's all bullshit!

43:22.099 --> 43:23.225
Hold it!

43:27.004 --> 43:27.971
Great!

44:03.407 --> 44:04.339
Come on!

44:05.142 --> 44:06.074
Let's go!

44:53.357 --> 44:54.415
Like it?

45:38.135 --> 45:40.000
Bronze medal for Russia!

45:42.272 --> 45:43.830
That guy's Russian.

45:46.744 --> 45:48.803
Silver medal for the Ukraine!

45:51.281 --> 45:52.714
He's Ukrainian.

45:54.351 --> 45:56.251
Gold medal for...

45:57.354 --> 45:58.480
Greece.

45:58.856 --> 46:00.153
He's Georgian.

46:01.792 --> 46:04.352
But he moved to Greece
and his coach adopted him

46:05.028 --> 46:07.963
so he could be in the Olympics
underthe Greek flag.

46:08.298 --> 46:09.890
He's Greek now!

46:12.236 --> 46:13.328
Ladies and gentlemen,

46:13.504 --> 46:15.404
the Greek national anthem!

46:16.039 --> 46:19.008
I recognize you by your face

46:19.176 --> 46:21.770
That violently de?nes the land

46:22.346 --> 46:25.873
From the sacred bones,

46:26.049 --> 46:28.882
Of the Greeks arisen...

46:29.987 --> 46:33.753
You‘ll find someone to fantasize about
when you fuck old dudes.

46:33.924 --> 46:35.516
You'd better think fast though.

46:36.193 --> 46:40.254
You don't want your mind to go blank

46:40.831 --> 46:42.765
while you're on thejob.

46:44.868 --> 46:48.861
I usually picture the leading lady
from that TV show

46:49.873 --> 46:51.135
Her tits!

46:51.308 --> 46:53.299
They really turn me on!

46:55.279 --> 47:00.512
Some pervs even think
of their mothers or sisters.

47:05.255 --> 47:06.483
How's the water?

47:07.191 --> 47:08.886
Is it getting cold?

47:43.260 --> 47:47.128
Michael arrived from Russia
a 15 days ago.

47:47.397 --> 47:49.558
He was going to stay here for good.

47:50.968 --> 47:53.835
He was very excited
to see his mother again.

47:54.538 --> 47:56.972
A fter his father died,

47:57.140 --> 48:00.075
his mother - my wife -
emigrated to Greece.

48:00.978 --> 48:03.469
So your mummy married this guy.

48:05.349 --> 48:07.283
They spent almost two years apart,

48:08.018 --> 48:09.315
and now...

48:11.622 --> 48:13.886
God only knows who he ran into.

48:16.593 --> 48:19.153
I'm sorry! Can't go on.

48:19.630 --> 48:20.858
It's all right.

48:23.100 --> 48:25.159
His mother is going out of her mind!

48:25.903 --> 48:27.029
And so am I!

48:28.071 --> 48:31.336
The three of us were so happy together.
Like a real family.

48:32.342 --> 48:37.644
I gave him all my fatherly love,
and he made me feel complete.

48:38.649 --> 48:40.583
I feel for you, Mr. Benakis,

48:41.151 --> 48:43.585
Your affection for children
is well-known.

48:43.954 --> 48:46.479
Especially when it's your own.

48:47.057 --> 48:50.151
You'll always be "Grandpa Earth" to me.

48:59.136 --> 49:00.899
I owe you my coming of age!

49:01.071 --> 49:03.437
Thank you so much, Mr. Paraskevas.

49:04.007 --> 49:06.908
Let's hope this story
will have a happy ending.

49:07.311 --> 49:11.247
This picture of Michael was taken
just a few days ago.

49:11.515 --> 49:14.541
But let's hear from Michael's mother.

49:17.521 --> 49:18.510
Misha,

49:20.357 --> 49:22.052
my little teddy bear...

49:24.594 --> 49:26.221
Please come home!

49:27.097 --> 49:30.089
If you can hear me,

49:31.635 --> 49:32.465
please

49:33.370 --> 49:35.235
come home to mama-bear.

54:08.745 --> 54:09.837
Are you coming up?

54:10.013 --> 54:11.674
The old man's waiting foryou.

54:12.382 --> 54:13.474
Come on!

55:55.018 --> 55:59.978
Howl regret all the wasted years

56:02.425 --> 56:04.950
Before I ?nally found you

56:05.128 --> 56:07.858
After waiting so long

56:09.399 --> 56:16.464
Oh how! Fear! Might lose you

56:16.639 --> 56:21.667
Because I'll never forget you

56:22.779 --> 56:28.445
Stay by my side my love

56:28.618 --> 56:33.578
Because! Need you to know

56:35.158 --> 56:42.530
How I fear! Might lose you

56:42.699 --> 56:45.896
How am I to forget you?

56:46.403 --> 56:51.033
When I love you so?

57:01.418 --> 57:04.910
This singer's first name was Sofia,
just like your mother.

57:05.588 --> 57:07.556
Sofia Vem bo.

57:16.032 --> 57:22.995
Howl regret all the wasted years

57:23.640 --> 57:26.473
Before I ?nally found you

57:26.643 --> 57:29.043
After waiting so long...

57:46.663 --> 57:50.895
the owners of the house
returned home.

57:51.634 --> 57:55.001
They were the seven dwarves.

57:55.171 --> 58:01.076
As soon as they arrived home,
they realised someone had beenthere.

58:01.244 --> 58:05.180
Things weren't the same
as they had left them.

58:05.882 --> 58:09.181
The ?rst one said,
"Who has been sitting in my chair?"

58:09.552 --> 58:12.715
The second one,
"Who has been eating my lunch?"

58:12.956 --> 58:16.619
The third one,
"Who has been eating my bread?"

58:17.026 --> 58:21.053
The fourth one,
"Who has been eating my vegetables?"

58:21.731 --> 58:25.929
The ?fth one,
"Who has been using my fork?"

58:26.870 --> 58:29.839
The sixth one,
"Who has been cutting with my knife?"

58:47.123 --> 58:49.216
This will be our little secret.

59:03.873 --> 59:04.862
Come over here.

59:07.110 --> 59:08.270
Watch your step!

59:40.109 --> 59:42.236
All this will be yours one day.

59:44.747 --> 59:47.113
I have no idea what I'd have done
if you hadn't come.

01:00:24.721 --> 01:00:28.248
I've waited forthis moment all my life,
and didn't even know it.

01:00:32.362 --> 01:00:35.354
When you left,
I almost went out of my mind.

01:00:39.268 --> 01:00:41.065
You're my son and heir!

01:00:41.938 --> 01:00:43.303
My successor.

01:00:45.808 --> 01:00:48.242
"Grandpa Earth" finally has a son.

01:01:34.724 --> 01:01:37.192
Greek lesson number 5.

01:01:39.295 --> 01:01:41.229
As soon as the baby was born,

01:01:41.397 --> 01:01:46.061
the fatherwould take it
to the Elders for inspection.

01:01:47.136 --> 01:01:48.728
When the child turned 7,

01:01:48.905 --> 01:01:51.999
it was taken from his mother
and given to the state.

01:01:52.809 --> 01:01:54.401
A rigorous discipline

01:01:55.278 --> 01:01:58.111
and military-type education commenced,

01:01:58.281 --> 01:02:02.047
lasting twelve years.

01:02:03.352 --> 01:02:05.445
Overseen by a "boy-herder",

01:02:05.822 --> 01:02:09.223
the boys were drilled in gymnastics,

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:11.984
running,

01:02:12.161 --> 01:02:13.389
jumping,

01:02:13.763 --> 01:02:17.756
and were also taught
to endure pain and hardship,

01:02:17.934 --> 01:02:20.926
hunger, thirst, cold,

01:02:21.104 --> 01:02:23.868
fatigue, and lack of sleep.

01:02:25.007 --> 01:02:27.100
They were only taught the basics

01:02:28.044 --> 01:02:30.979
of reading and writing.

01:02:31.814 --> 01:02:35.841
Their allegiance to their country
was fierce,

01:02:36.285 --> 01:02:41.746
to the point of self-sacrifice.

01:02:43.025 --> 01:02:46.961
When a mother saw her son off to war,

01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:51.157
she always told him to fight bravely,

01:02:51.334 --> 01:02:55.862
honor his armor
and die for his country, if necessary.

01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:04.106
Calm down, Vera!

01:03:10.286 --> 01:03:11.776
Vera...

01:03:16.058 --> 01:03:17.821
We need a doctor! Is there a doctor?

01:03:17.994 --> 01:03:19.325
She just passed out.

01:03:20.029 --> 01:03:21.360
She's 5 months pregnant!

01:03:21.531 --> 01:03:24.261
You think she'll lose the baby
at her dad's funeral?

01:03:24.433 --> 01:03:26.901
No, she won't!

01:03:27.069 --> 01:03:30.129
We only watched it a few months ago,
don't you remember?

01:03:44.554 --> 01:03:45.851
Are you asleep?

01:03:48.491 --> 01:03:51.085
I forgot to tell you about the show

01:03:52.461 --> 01:03:56.295
I'd only seen that one episode,
at Nina's house.

01:04:06.008 --> 01:04:08.533
I'm going to bed. Goodnight.

01:04:19.088 --> 01:04:23.286
Those were the days, my friend

01:04:23.459 --> 01:04:25.825
We thought they'd never end

01:04:25.995 --> 01:04:27.428
We'd sing and dance

01:04:27.597 --> 01:04:30.225
Forever and a day

01:04:30.399 --> 01:04:32.833
We'd live the life we choose

01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:34.896
We'd ?ght and never lose

01:04:35.071 --> 01:04:36.436
For we were young

01:04:36.606 --> 01:04:38.574
And sure to have our way

01:04:49.919 --> 01:04:50.977
Thank you!

01:04:55.925 --> 01:04:58.257
Happy birthday, Misha!

01:05:05.434 --> 01:05:09.268
Let pedestrians run oddly
on the street by the puddles

01:05:09.438 --> 01:05:12.896
And the asphalt is flooded by rain

01:05:13.276 --> 01:05:17.144
They cannot understand,
that this day is not simple

01:05:17.313 --> 01:05:20.646
And why I'm so happy today

01:05:29.091 --> 01:05:33.084
And I'm playing the accordion

01:05:33.262 --> 01:05:37.062
And all the people gaze at me

01:05:37.233 --> 01:05:40.999
Such a pity, birthday parties

01:05:41.170 --> 01:05:44.401
Are only once a year

01:05:53.449 --> 01:05:54.507
What do we say?

01:05:55.117 --> 01:05:56.209
Thank you.

01:06:04.026 --> 01:06:06.927
Long live Michael

01:06:07.096 --> 01:06:08.927
And happy birthday

01:06:09.398 --> 01:06:12.094
May you grow old

01:06:12.268 --> 01:06:14.202
With white hair

01:08:55.331 --> 01:08:58.528
Can we get a picture together later?

01:08:59.268 --> 01:09:00.496
For my mum!

01:09:05.674 --> 01:09:08.234
It's so hot, where's my fan!

01:09:11.313 --> 01:09:13.178
I won't eat now

01:09:13.515 --> 01:09:15.506
I'll take the food to go.

01:09:15.684 --> 01:09:17.549
Are you eating?
- No way!

01:09:18.621 --> 01:09:19.849
How about you?

01:09:20.221 --> 01:09:21.279
Are you eating?

01:09:25.361 --> 01:09:26.885
He's learning, eh?

01:09:27.496 --> 01:09:29.691
I'm doing my best.

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:37.772
Where did he run off to
when you were on TV?

01:09:38.407 --> 01:09:43.207
I sent him out
for a newspaper and he got lost.

01:09:43.379 --> 01:09:45.438
Sofia must have been in agony?

01:09:46.247 --> 01:09:48.307
Mr. Nikos, what's wrong?

01:09:48.484 --> 01:09:49.781
Help! Somebody help!

01:09:49.952 --> 01:09:53.683
We need a doctor! Is there a doctor?

01:09:57.393 --> 01:09:59.691
For real!

01:10:05.768 --> 01:10:07.497
We need an ambulance!

01:10:09.305 --> 01:10:10.465
Something's wrong!

01:10:11.273 --> 01:10:12.900
Somebody calla doctor!

01:10:27.223 --> 01:10:28.417
Is he going to die?

01:10:34.463 --> 01:10:35.555
May be.

01:10:38.834 --> 01:10:40.961
Will you be sorry if he does?

01:10:49.878 --> 01:10:50.902
Yes.

01:10:58.988 --> 01:11:00.512
Do you love him?

01:11:04.293 --> 01:11:05.521
In my own way.

01:11:13.636 --> 01:11:15.604
Like you loved dad?

01:11:30.886 --> 01:11:32.444
That was different.

01:14:24.092 --> 01:14:25.957
Grandpa Earth

01:14:27.863 --> 01:14:29.728
Armed Forces Television

01:14:29.965 --> 01:14:32.092
presents a children's show

01:14:32.534 --> 01:14:34.695
by Nikolaos Benakis

01:14:34.937 --> 01:14:38.600
GRANDPA EARTH

01:14:39.475 --> 01:14:40.442
Good evening.

01:14:40.876 --> 01:14:42.138
When was this made?

01:14:42.511 --> 01:14:44.741
1971.

01:14:47.049 --> 01:14:49.745
The tape is in pretty good shape
for its age.

01:14:49.918 --> 01:14:51.146
What is he talking about?

01:14:53.622 --> 01:14:55.089
Got any more?

01:14:55.257 --> 01:14:57.191
Yes. What is he talking about?

01:14:59.528 --> 01:15:03.658
It's kind of like... parenting advice.

01:15:05.834 --> 01:15:08.496
"The hero does things
he never knew he could.

01:15:08.670 --> 01:15:10.831
"He slays dragons and solves riddles,

01:15:11.607 --> 01:15:17.068
"until he can rescue
the fair princess and marry her."

01:15:18.514 --> 01:15:21.483
"So the fairy tale implies
that it's not the father

01:15:22.618 --> 01:15:26.213
"who stands between the boy
and his mother, it's the dragon!"

01:15:28.257 --> 01:15:31.749
"The boy doesn't really want
the mother."

01:15:32.294 --> 01:15:34.125
Grandpa!
Tell me a story!

01:15:34.296 --> 01:15:35.786
Fast-fonNard it.

01:15:42.704 --> 01:15:43.728
Press play!

01:15:44.907 --> 01:15:48.536
He encounters a terrible dragon!

01:15:51.547 --> 01:15:57.543
The dragon fed daily on young damsels.

01:15:59.688 --> 01:16:00.780
It's a hoot!

01:16:03.959 --> 01:16:05.790
He plays all the parts himself.

01:16:05.961 --> 01:16:08.191
He changes costumes
and alters his voice.

01:16:10.132 --> 01:16:12.600
He was a knight earlier,

01:16:12.868 --> 01:16:14.096
and then a dragon.

01:16:16.305 --> 01:16:17.795
Now he's the princess.

01:16:17.973 --> 01:16:22.603
The king said, "Whoever kills the dragon

01:16:22.778 --> 01:16:25.611
"will have the maiden's hand
in marriage."

01:16:29.251 --> 01:16:32.084
Now he's reading fan mail.

01:16:32.254 --> 01:16:35.621
He says it's from 8-year-old Sofia
from Karditsa.

01:16:36.625 --> 01:16:38.252
"Dear Mr. Nikos,

01:16:39.761 --> 01:16:42.321
"I'd love a rerun

01:16:42.698 --> 01:16:46.156
"of Goldilocks and the Three Bears.

01:16:47.636 --> 01:16:51.902
"And I'd like you to tell Santa Claus

01:16:52.741 --> 01:16:56.677
"to bring me a bear for Christmas."

01:16:59.915 --> 01:17:02.577
Can you imagine this guy
in a bear costume?

01:17:04.686 --> 01:17:06.153
As soon as the baby was born,

01:17:06.321 --> 01:17:11.588
the father would take it
to the Elders for inspection.

01:17:11.994 --> 01:17:15.191
If they found it was deformed or weakly,

01:17:16.131 --> 01:17:19.965
they'd throw it in the chasm
of a nearby mountain.

01:17:24.239 --> 01:17:27.072
Otherwise, they would return it
to its mother.

01:17:27.809 --> 01:17:32.246
When the child turned 7,
it was taken and given to the state.

01:17:32.414 --> 01:17:36.908
A rigorous discipline and military-type
education commenced,

01:17:37.085 --> 01:17:40.054
lasting twelve years.

01:17:40.656 --> 01:17:42.715
So when a mother saw her son

01:17:42.891 --> 01:17:44.324
off to war,

01:17:44.693 --> 01:17:46.684
she always reminded him

01:17:46.862 --> 01:17:48.261
to ?ght bravely,

01:17:48.430 --> 01:17:50.159
honor his armor,

01:17:50.799 --> 01:17:53.359
and die for his country, if necessary.

01:18:01.410 --> 01:18:02.934
We're home!

01:18:09.117 --> 01:18:10.414
Misha, we're home!

01:18:16.391 --> 01:18:17.824
Will you close the door?

01:19:03.038 --> 01:19:05.973
Let your hair down!
You don't look like my mum.

01:19:06.341 --> 01:19:08.366
But it's too hot.

01:19:14.282 --> 01:19:16.147
Now we look more alike.

01:19:17.185 --> 01:19:20.177
No matterwhat you do,
you still look like your dad.

01:19:53.021 --> 01:19:55.455
I think I saw you.

01:19:55.824 --> 01:19:58.452
You're in the back, right-hand corner.
Can you see?

01:19:59.027 --> 01:19:59.994
Yes.

01:20:01.863 --> 01:20:03.421
A doctor!
Is there a doctor in the house?

01:20:03.799 --> 01:20:04.993
Yes, right here!

01:20:12.407 --> 01:20:13.965
Are you married?

01:20:17.212 --> 01:20:18.110
That's it!

01:20:18.580 --> 01:20:20.946
I wonder what happens next!

01:20:23.118 --> 01:20:25.882
Mr. Nikos is an old pro!

01:20:26.054 --> 01:20:27.282
A real veteran.

01:20:27.455 --> 01:20:28.786
He was not bad.

01:20:31.293 --> 01:20:35.559
I heard the screenwriter
was pretty upset about the stroke.

01:20:35.931 --> 01:20:38.092
He'll have to write him
out ofthe story.

01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:44.937
Little Michael is starting
to look a bit like him.

01:20:45.407 --> 01:20:49.173
You can tell he's Mr. Nikos' son.

01:20:49.611 --> 01:20:50.805
May be...

01:21:00.422 --> 01:21:03.823
Why have you left the shutters open?
It's so hot!

01:21:04.125 --> 01:21:06.286
I told Andreas we need air conditioning.

01:21:07.362 --> 01:21:10.229
Do you have AC?
- Only in the bedroom.

01:21:10.398 --> 01:21:12.832
Notthe living room, huh?
- No.

01:21:13.168 --> 01:21:15.261
Doesn't little Michael get hot?

01:21:15.437 --> 01:21:16.927
Don't you get hot?

01:21:17.372 --> 01:21:21.240
In your country,
you're not used to this kind of weather!

01:21:21.409 --> 01:21:22.603
He hasn't said anything.

01:21:31.286 --> 01:21:33.846
Did you go to the Olympics at all?

01:21:34.422 --> 01:21:36.982
Mr. Nikos took Misha
to the shooting range.

01:21:37.158 --> 01:21:39.285
He'd gotten tickets
to a swim event, too.

01:21:39.461 --> 01:21:41.986
We're doing well
in the medals department!

01:21:45.233 --> 01:21:46.996
It's dripping.

01:21:48.136 --> 01:21:49.501
Are you Russian, too?

01:21:50.238 --> 01:21:52.035
No, I was born here.

01:21:52.207 --> 01:21:54.402
But my parents are Georgian.

01:21:54.576 --> 01:21:57.909
Oh well, Russia, Georgia, Ukraine,
same difference!

01:21:59.214 --> 01:22:00.545
Are you married?

01:22:01.182 --> 01:22:01.978
No.

01:22:02.384 --> 01:22:06.286
I hope you find a nice man,
like Sofia found Mr. Nikos.

01:22:08.523 --> 01:22:09.649
Thank you.

01:22:11.126 --> 01:22:12.457
And have kids.

01:22:14.462 --> 01:22:19.195
Sofia got lucky, people like Mr. Nikos
are rare nowadays.

01:22:20.568 --> 01:22:23.298
He even signed overthe house,
didn't he Sofia?

01:22:23.471 --> 01:22:24.563
Not to me.

01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:25.998
To Misha.

01:22:31.012 --> 01:22:33.947
Is little Michael going to school
in September?

01:22:34.115 --> 01:22:35.013
Yes.

01:22:35.650 --> 01:22:37.515
Will he go to a Greek school?
- Yes.

01:22:37.686 --> 01:22:39.051
What grade?

01:22:39.321 --> 01:22:41.346
I'm not sure. Nikos handled that.

01:22:41.523 --> 01:22:43.514
Yes, he told us he was tutoring him.

01:22:44.025 --> 01:22:46.016
Howfar along where they in history?

01:22:46.194 --> 01:22:47.525
I can't really say.

01:22:50.999 --> 01:22:53.024
I'll just ask Michael then!

01:22:53.201 --> 01:22:53.963
Michael?

01:22:54.669 --> 01:23:00.039
How far have you gotten
with history and geography?

01:23:01.609 --> 01:23:03.304
Do you understand me?

01:23:14.622 --> 01:23:15.714
Are you hot?

01:23:16.624 --> 01:23:18.455
Yes, aren't you?

01:23:19.661 --> 01:23:20.719
Yes.

01:23:24.065 --> 01:23:26.033
The iron is only making it worse.

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:42.207
Maybe I won't iron Nikos' clothes.

01:23:44.386 --> 01:23:46.217
Who's going to notice anyway?

01:23:50.492 --> 01:23:52.016
You know what?

01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:55.293
You could sleep in our bedroom
nowthat it's so hot.

01:23:57.399 --> 01:23:59.299
Since we have air conditioning...

01:24:02.270 --> 01:24:03.430
Rapunzel.

01:24:04.039 --> 01:24:05.472
Once upon a time,

01:24:09.544 --> 01:24:11.068
When she turned 11,

01:24:11.246 --> 01:24:16.183
a witch shut her up in a tower
with neither stairs nor door.

01:24:16.518 --> 01:24:20.318
Just a little window near the top.

01:24:21.589 --> 01:24:25.685
When the witch wanted to go up,
she stood beneath and cried:

01:24:26.061 --> 01:24:30.361
"Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
let down your hair to me."

01:24:30.532 --> 01:24:35.629
Rapunzel had magni?cent long hair,
fine as spun gold."

01:25:10.205 --> 01:25:11.433
Did you feed him?

01:25:12.574 --> 01:25:13.598
Good!

01:25:14.442 --> 01:25:15.568
Atta b oy!

01:25:17.712 --> 01:25:19.703
No, you don't have to do anything.

01:25:19.881 --> 01:25:21.109
Get some rest.

01:25:22.417 --> 01:25:23.406
Bye!

01:27:08.890 --> 01:27:10.881
I love you.

01:27:44.292 --> 01:27:45.589
"Dear Mr. Nikos,

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:49.355
"I live really faraway,
but one day, I'll come find you.

01:27:49.864 --> 01:27:53.595
"I told my mum, and we'll come together.

01:27:54.002 --> 01:27:57.233
"We'll take the bus or the train.

01:27:57.839 --> 01:28:01.468
"My mum is really pretty,
I bet you'll like her.

01:28:03.411 --> 01:28:05.743
"You can marry her if you want

01:28:05.913 --> 01:28:08.347
"and we can all be together forever.

01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:12.319
"I f it works out,
the three of us will be very happy.

01:28:12.987 --> 01:28:15.854
"You will have
a young and beautiful wife,

01:28:16.024 --> 01:28:18.857
"my mum will have a husband,
and I'll have a daddy!

01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:21.690
"I'm also sending a drawing,

01:28:21.863 --> 01:28:24.297
"of the three of us...

01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:13.147
I've known love aplenty

01:29:13.147 --> 01:29:15.741
I've known love aplenty

01:29:15.917 --> 01:29:18.579
I've mated and parted

01:29:18.753 --> 01:29:20.880
But no matter where I darted

01:29:21.055 --> 01:29:24.388
You were always on my mind

01:29:24.559 --> 01:29:27.084
Even in my dreams

01:29:27.462 --> 01:29:29.896
My lips yearned for you

01:29:30.064 --> 01:29:32.430
My soul searched for you

01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:35.967
In secret! Longed for you

01:29:37.038 --> 01:29:44.342
Howl regret all the wasted years

01:29:44.512 --> 01:29:46.980
Before I ?nally found you

01:29:47.148 --> 01:29:49.776
After waiting so long

01:29:51.452 --> 01:29:58.483
Oh how! Fear! Might lose you

01:29:58.659 --> 01:30:03.722
Because I'll never forget you

01:30:04.832 --> 01:30:10.134
Stay by my side my love

01:30:10.605 --> 01:30:15.599
Because! Need you to know

01:30:17.145 --> 01:30:24.517
How I fear! Might lose you

01:30:24.685 --> 01:30:28.052
How am I to forget you?

01:30:28.423 --> 01:30:33.656
When I love you so?

01:31:30.184 --> 01:31:31.082
My boy!

01:31:34.555 --> 01:31:35.852
What's with the disguises?

01:31:36.157 --> 01:31:39.456
It's his birthday today
and I'm throwing him a party.

01:31:39.627 --> 01:31:40.594
Acostume party?

01:31:42.730 --> 01:31:44.095
How old is he?

01:31:44.265 --> 01:31:45.493
75.

01:31:46.634 --> 01:31:50.195
I've never been to a party
for a 75-year-old.

01:32:49.664 --> 01:32:53.225
Duce puts on his uniform

01:32:53.601 --> 01:32:55.228
And his tall, feathered cap

01:32:57.271 --> 01:32:59.034
One moonlit night

01:32:59.206 --> 01:33:02.869
He sets out to invade Greece, poor guy!

01:33:05.179 --> 01:33:09.912
Up in the mountains
he encounters our brave evzone

01:33:10.885 --> 01:33:13.251
Let's put the TV on,
see what Grandpa says!

01:33:17.892 --> 01:33:22.261
Jack is a child
who's already grappling

01:33:22.630 --> 01:33:24.325
with adolescence,

01:33:24.799 --> 01:33:26.630
but he still hasn't managed

01:33:26.801 --> 01:33:29.702
to overcome his Oedipal syndrome.

01:33:30.771 --> 01:33:33.934
Jack isn't mature enough

01:33:34.108 --> 01:33:37.737
to handle his blossoming sexuality.

01:33:38.012 --> 01:33:41.277
My little rosebud,
wanna blossom with me?

01:33:41.649 --> 01:33:43.981
I'm not ready,
I'm not mature enough to blossom!

01:33:44.151 --> 01:33:45.175
What is this faggot talking about?

01:33:45.353 --> 01:33:46.285
Is he a faggot?

01:33:46.654 --> 01:33:47.916
What else would he be?

01:33:48.089 --> 01:33:51.149
I bow at your feet.
I want you to tame me!

01:33:51.325 --> 01:33:53.589
Grandpa, tell me a story.

01:33:53.761 --> 01:33:55.353
Story time!

01:33:57.031 --> 01:33:58.760
Story time!

01:34:01.769 --> 01:34:03.031
Settle down!

01:34:04.905 --> 01:34:06.634
Once upon a time,

01:34:10.745 --> 01:34:13.145
He and his mother were alone
in the world

01:34:13.314 --> 01:34:14.872
after his father died.

01:34:15.049 --> 01:34:18.280
All they had to live on,

01:34:18.886 --> 01:34:21.946
was a cow called Milky White.

01:34:29.196 --> 01:34:33.098
Milky White gave plenty of milk
each and every morning.

01:34:36.337 --> 01:34:38.168
The old man is very sick.

01:34:40.307 --> 01:34:42.070
I can tell.

01:34:42.743 --> 01:34:44.370
He's a total vegetable.

01:34:45.980 --> 01:34:49.006
This is probably going to be
his last birthday.

01:34:51.185 --> 01:34:52.880
Too bad...

01:34:53.454 --> 01:34:55.979
Turns out, he and my mother are married.

01:34:56.991 --> 01:34:59.721
But it's kind of make-believe.
He's a faggot.

01:34:59.994 --> 01:35:01.427
You'd never guess.

01:35:01.796 --> 01:35:03.263
My mum told me all about it.

01:35:09.203 --> 01:35:12.798
That's why I called you.
I thought he might as well die happy.

01:35:19.447 --> 01:35:21.074
I'll pay you.

01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:34.687
I don't want your money.

01:35:35.129 --> 01:35:38.326
Consider it a gift to my little brother!

01:35:40.768 --> 01:35:43.896
He even asked my mum
to put an end to his life.

01:35:44.805 --> 01:35:46.773
He can't stand living like this.

01:35:48.442 --> 01:35:49.966
I wouldn't either.

01:35:50.344 --> 01:35:52.335
But my mother can't do it.

01:35:56.851 --> 01:35:59.285
It's a tough deal.

01:36:01.188 --> 01:36:03.952
I'm thinking of doing it myself.

01:36:12.933 --> 01:36:14.230
Hour?

01:36:14.502 --> 01:36:16.026
With one of his guns.

01:36:16.203 --> 01:36:18.467
I'm a little scared,
but I feel sorry for him.

01:36:18.839 --> 01:36:22.366
I'd make it look like a suicide.

01:36:33.554 --> 01:36:35.215
Will you help me out?

01:36:38.793 --> 01:36:41.990
And I'm playing the accordion

01:36:43.297 --> 01:36:47.358
And all the people gaze at me

01:36:47.535 --> 01:36:51.494
Such a pity, birthday parties

01:36:52.139 --> 01:36:56.098
Are only once a year

01:37:11.892 --> 01:37:14.417
One, two,

01:37:14.962 --> 01:37:16.122
three, go!

01:37:16.964 --> 01:37:17.794
Well done!

01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:21.192
Happy birthday!

01:37:22.870 --> 01:37:26.271
To his surprise the giant woke up,

01:37:27.474 --> 01:37:29.806
yelling: "I'll kill you, I'll kill you!"

01:37:30.444 --> 01:37:31.570
What's up?

01:37:32.513 --> 01:37:34.071
None of your business!

01:37:36.317 --> 01:37:40.310
Jack started to climb down
the beanstalk as fast as he could.

01:37:41.121 --> 01:37:42.554
When he touched the ground,

01:37:42.923 --> 01:37:46.222
he saw the giant coming after him.

01:37:49.463 --> 01:37:51.021
Jack grabbed an axe

01:37:51.265 --> 01:37:53.426
and started chopping down the beanstalk.

01:37:57.872 --> 01:37:59.271
The beanstalk toppled over.

01:38:00.207 --> 01:38:03.301
And the giant fell with a crash.

01:38:04.211 --> 01:38:07.840
His cries echoed through the land!

01:38:23.230 --> 01:38:26.393
Startled by the noise,
his mother came running.

01:38:27.001 --> 01:38:29.595
"We'll never be poor again," said Jack.

01:38:31.338 --> 01:38:33.533
His mother embraced him.

01:38:34.541 --> 01:38:36.873
They never lacked anything again

01:38:37.244 --> 01:38:41.374
and they lived happily ever after!

01:38:48.289 --> 01:38:49.449
Quick!

01:39:31.999 --> 01:39:34.399
It's time to extinguish
the Olympic Flame.

01:39:52.186 --> 01:39:53.175
The audience

01:39:54.154 --> 01:39:56.679
completes this magical image.

01:40:45.606 --> 01:40:47.005
Mum!

01:40:47.775 --> 01:40:49.106
Open up!

01:40:57.785 --> 01:40:59.275
Open up!

01:41:09.630 --> 01:41:11.154
Open up!

01:41:20.474 --> 01:41:26.208
The stadium stands

01:41:27.748 --> 01:41:30.216
Are getting quiet...

01:41:32.753 --> 01:41:35.449
Time of miracles

01:41:36.523 --> 01:41:39.048
Is melting away

01:41:41.195 --> 01:41:43.493
Farewell to you,

01:41:44.198 --> 01:41:47.827
Our tender Misha,

01:41:48.836 --> 01:41:51.100
Go back home

01:41:51.638 --> 01:41:54.505
To your wood of fairy tales

01:42:03.183 --> 01:42:04.309
love...

01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:08.651
With no end...

01:42:10.491 --> 01:42:12.550
Bright and clear echo

01:42:13.627 --> 01:42:20.157
Of the Olympics...

01:43:03.243 --> 01:43:04.540
Forgive me.

01:43:11.585 --> 01:43:12.779
I love you.

01:43:17.791 --> 01:43:19.190
So much.

01:43:26.233 --> 01:43:27.564
My little teddy bear.

01:43:49.323 --> 01:43:55.785
The stadium stands are getting quiet

01:43:55.963 --> 01:44:01.333
Time of miracles is melting away

01:44:02.703 --> 01:44:09.370
Farewell to you, our tender Misha

01:44:09.543 --> 01:44:14.537
Go back home to your wood of fairy tales

01:44:16.316 --> 01:44:22.915
So let's wish lots of luck to each other

01:44:23.290 --> 01:44:28.455
Let's wish kindness and love with no end

01:44:29.763 --> 01:44:36.498
Bright and clear echo of the Olympics

01:44:36.670 --> 01:44:41.869
Will forever be cherished and sung

01:44:43.410 --> 01:44:49.838
Farewell to you, Moscow, farewell

01:44:50.017 --> 01:44:55.751
Farewell, Olympic fairy tale...

01:44:58.992 --> 01:45:02.928
