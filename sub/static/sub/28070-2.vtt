00:06.005 --> 00:09.165
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:29.365 --> 00:31.325
All this stuff was Mom's?

00:34.085 --> 00:35.725
Come on, let's look for it.

00:40.765 --> 00:43.005
Hey! What the fuck are you doing?

00:45.405 --> 00:47.805
So you went ahead to spite me?

00:47.885 --> 00:49.525
And you brought him along, too.

00:49.605 --> 00:52.405
How many times have I told you
not to come out here? How many?

00:52.765 --> 00:54.765
The ring that me and Mom made for him.

00:55.245 --> 00:57.885
The one made out of wire, where is it?

00:58.285 --> 01:01.205
-You came here for that?
-I came to show him who his mother was.

01:03.045 --> 01:04.885
Don't touch her!

01:07.205 --> 01:09.125
What the fuck are you doing?

01:17.805 --> 01:19.045
Keep your hands off her!

01:27.645 --> 01:29.485
I had Mom's ring.

01:30.285 --> 01:31.525
You just had to ask.

01:35.725 --> 01:37.685
I thought you were different.

01:55.005 --> 01:56.005
Here.

02:04.565 --> 02:05.885
Let me see.

02:06.565 --> 02:08.485
Hey! I said let me see.

02:17.685 --> 02:19.405
I'm sorry, Aureliano.

03:04.725 --> 03:07.005
-Why can't I go in?
-You can't talk to him.

03:07.805 --> 03:09.445
What do we do with her?

03:09.525 --> 03:11.925
-You don't get it, I have to talk to him.
-You can't.

03:12.005 --> 03:14.045
It concerns him too, not just me.

03:14.125 --> 03:16.885
Pay for her father's funeral
and let's put an end to this.

03:17.765 --> 03:18.965
I'm not going.

03:24.005 --> 03:25.645
Aureliano, don't fuck up.

03:27.045 --> 03:31.125
I've known you two since you were small.
Ostia needs the Adamis.

03:32.605 --> 03:33.885
Both of you.

03:41.405 --> 03:44.205
-I don't know where he is.
-You are his wife.

03:44.285 --> 03:48.125
If you want to save your family,
find a way to make him come home.

03:48.965 --> 03:50.005
Now.

03:53.045 --> 03:54.965
You shouldn't have troubled yourself.

03:56.285 --> 04:00.005
Adelaide, I'm asking this respectfully.
Where the fuck is Livia?

04:00.085 --> 04:04.125
Something unexpected came up.
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

04:04.485 --> 04:06.005
You mean you don't have her anymore?

04:06.845 --> 04:09.445
Relax, I'll bring her to you.

04:13.325 --> 04:15.165
Don't make me come back here.

04:21.964 --> 04:24.084
If Samurai finds out
what I've done I'm fucked.

04:24.964 --> 04:28.205
Spadino, I listened to you,
but Aureliano doesn't trust us anymore.

04:28.845 --> 04:31.685
-He'll call us.
-And what if he doesn't?

04:32.645 --> 04:35.245
-Besides, why should he?
-Because the last time...

04:35.605 --> 04:36.925
What about the last time?

04:41.525 --> 04:44.605
What happened, Spadino?
Is there something you should tell me?

04:44.685 --> 04:47.685
-It was nothing, we had an argument.
-Everyone argues with Aureliano.

04:47.765 --> 04:49.165
Yes, maybe.

04:52.845 --> 04:54.245
What do you want?

04:57.325 --> 04:59.165
What do you want?

05:00.525 --> 05:02.685
-I want to be free.
-Me, too.

05:03.245 --> 05:06.205
That's why we have to team up again,
against Samurai.

05:06.285 --> 05:08.085
But we can't do it without Aureliano.

05:08.685 --> 05:09.725
Maybe.

05:14.965 --> 05:16.045
I've got to go.

05:53.285 --> 05:54.325
Aureliano?

05:58.765 --> 05:59.885
Talk to me.

06:03.485 --> 06:04.605
Please.

06:05.405 --> 06:08.205
I'm really sorry for what I did to Isabel.

06:09.365 --> 06:11.645
I only came back
to ask for your forgiveness.

06:26.565 --> 06:27.565
Open up.

06:30.805 --> 06:31.965
Look at me.

07:09.925 --> 07:10.925
Aureliano?

07:16.365 --> 07:17.645
You were right.

07:18.765 --> 07:20.765
You stole most of your votes
from the Left.

07:21.165 --> 07:22.165
Yeah...

07:23.485 --> 07:26.205
That means you can ask them for more
than a commissionership.

07:27.045 --> 07:28.525
That's not the point.

07:28.605 --> 07:29.725
What is?

07:32.525 --> 07:34.285
That they're not certain to win.

07:39.525 --> 07:41.165
-May I?
-Of course.

07:48.645 --> 07:52.405
Your 9% is a nice little treasure
to decide who'll be the next mayor.

07:52.485 --> 07:53.925
What do you intend to do with it?

07:54.245 --> 07:57.965
-What would you do?
-I'd give it to the winner, the Left.

07:59.645 --> 08:01.965
Do you always see things so clearly
from your parlor?

08:03.485 --> 08:06.565
Cinaglia, who will you form
an alliance with before the run-off?

08:07.885 --> 08:11.085
I don't know.
I live in a basement apartment.

08:11.165 --> 08:13.845
Then come to dinner tonight
with your wife.

08:14.965 --> 08:16.485
You can see all of Rome.

08:18.405 --> 08:22.485
And believe me,
with my help, your little treasure

08:23.045 --> 08:24.885
can become a gold mine.

08:41.564 --> 08:44.445
-Sandro!
-What are you doing here?

08:47.164 --> 08:49.164
You're looking well, too, thank you.

08:49.245 --> 08:51.365
We said we wouldn't meet
till the judge summoned us.

08:51.445 --> 08:53.965
Yes, but Cardinal Pascagni
has been arrested.

08:54.285 --> 08:55.725
I need a favor.

08:58.965 --> 09:00.805
It's the last one I'll ask you.

09:02.485 --> 09:06.725
I urgently need an appointment
with his replacement, Cardinal Nascari.

09:07.165 --> 09:09.205
I'm done using my name
in the Vatican for you.

09:09.285 --> 09:11.165
But it's very important.

09:11.245 --> 09:13.485
Sandro... please.

09:15.605 --> 09:17.005
I want the loft back.

09:19.125 --> 09:20.365
I've got lots of debts.

09:21.685 --> 09:24.525
-And I want it today.
-Today? How can I do it today?

09:24.925 --> 09:27.365
You'll find a way, like you always have.

09:31.805 --> 09:34.045
-All right.
-I'll let you know.

09:41.405 --> 09:42.405
Come in.

09:43.605 --> 09:45.125
Hi, what do you need?

09:45.605 --> 09:47.565
These license plates need checking.

09:54.565 --> 09:55.605
What is it?

09:57.565 --> 09:59.645
I'd like to do something more useful.

10:03.525 --> 10:05.645
-Like?
-Get out onto the street.

10:06.565 --> 10:08.045
You said I was your best officer.

10:08.685 --> 10:11.165
Yes. Cristiana,
this is what needs to be done today.

10:11.245 --> 10:14.285
But check them on the street if you want.
After all, they're license plates.

10:14.965 --> 10:16.565
Close the door after you, please.

10:27.125 --> 10:31.085
An independent candidate has never before
achieved these results in Rome.

10:31.165 --> 10:33.445
Well done, Cinaglia.
How did you celebrate?

10:35.005 --> 10:36.005
In moderation.

10:38.685 --> 10:41.325
Today,
the Left will welcome you with open arms.

10:47.005 --> 10:48.485
I'll let you know.

10:53.445 --> 10:56.285
Can we trust him? He looks uncertain.

10:56.365 --> 10:57.245
No.

10:58.085 --> 11:00.085
The Left will make him commissioner.

11:00.645 --> 11:03.285
Once they elect a mayor
he'll ensure we get the port.

11:07.005 --> 11:08.285
You've got the Vatican land.

11:09.445 --> 11:12.645
But you still need Livia's signature
to get the Adamis' land.

11:12.725 --> 11:14.845
I've been waiting three months for them.

11:15.565 --> 11:16.805
I'm sorting it out.

11:17.165 --> 11:18.365
As I always do.

11:33.565 --> 11:35.365
[in Sinti] [Hello, everyone.]

11:43.405 --> 11:44.325
Shame on you!

11:44.845 --> 11:47.165
Boy, Ma, you're always happy to see me.

11:47.245 --> 11:49.005
I just covered for you with Samurai.

11:49.445 --> 11:51.805
I didn't tell him anything
about what you did.

11:52.405 --> 11:54.165
Ma, I don't need you to cover my ass.

11:55.885 --> 11:56.925
Where's Livia?

11:59.845 --> 12:02.005
Do you really want to know? Huh?

12:05.965 --> 12:07.485
You took her to Aureliano Adami.

12:08.165 --> 12:09.885
What else was I to do, Ma?

12:09.965 --> 12:12.005
They're brother and sister.

12:12.085 --> 12:13.925
Some things should stay in the family.

12:16.325 --> 12:18.485
[What are you doing? Let go of me!]

12:53.805 --> 12:56.485
You didn't think
I'd be the one coming here, did you?

12:56.565 --> 12:58.325
Luckily, you're a friendly face.

13:00.525 --> 13:03.765
Tomorrow we'll hold a press conference
here to declare our alliance.

13:04.725 --> 13:06.725
Have you done a few calculations?

13:08.005 --> 13:11.525
We can guarantee you
a commissionership and some appointments.

13:13.445 --> 13:18.645
Gabriella, that's of secondary importance.
I mean, do you understand why I got 9.4%?

13:19.165 --> 13:21.885
You voiced
an important new political sentiment.

13:21.965 --> 13:25.165
No, Stefano,
I spoke about security and immigration.

13:26.205 --> 13:28.525
How do you plan
to tackle these two issues?

13:28.605 --> 13:30.685
Now, two weeks
from the end of the campaign?

13:33.085 --> 13:35.005
We have a clear political platform

13:35.085 --> 13:37.805
and our electorate
understands and supports it.

13:38.925 --> 13:40.965
We don't feel any need to change it.

13:41.765 --> 13:44.325
But the electorate
has expressed strong feelings.

13:45.565 --> 13:48.765
The issue of security in Rome
cannot be ignored.

13:48.845 --> 13:52.605
Listen, Amedeo,
congratulations on your 9%, I mean that,

13:52.685 --> 13:55.245
but we're not going
to change our strategy for you.

13:58.005 --> 14:00.565
In that case we have nothing more
to say to each other.

14:01.605 --> 14:02.685
Precisely.

14:06.965 --> 14:09.045
I want to be with the winners.

14:10.445 --> 14:12.645
But if it goes on like this,
you'll come second.

14:17.645 --> 14:20.925
As has happened for years,
we'll win this election.

14:21.005 --> 14:22.805
With or without you.

14:24.085 --> 14:26.125
And you'll be left alone,
in the opposition.

14:28.445 --> 14:30.085
All the best, Amedeo.

14:48.885 --> 14:50.445
Cardinal Nascari.

14:51.045 --> 14:52.045
Good afternoon.

14:53.005 --> 14:54.125
No, no...

14:56.125 --> 14:58.965
Excuse the mess, I only recently moved in.

14:59.365 --> 15:03.685
This place looked like a museum,
not a workplace.

15:05.725 --> 15:07.765
Your Eminence,
I won't take up too much time.

15:07.845 --> 15:11.565
I'd like to speak to you
about last night's emergency.

15:11.645 --> 15:15.965
There are hundreds of migrants
and my charity is ready to take them in.

15:16.045 --> 15:17.845
I am sorry, madam,

15:17.925 --> 15:22.965
but the facilities that Cardinal Pascagni
assigned to you are no longer available.

15:23.805 --> 15:28.685
There's an internal investigation
that will be respected and supported.

15:29.085 --> 15:30.845
But where will the migrants be put?

15:31.245 --> 15:35.925
There are many associations close to us,
run by competent people.

15:36.005 --> 15:39.365
But none of them can guarantee
that families will be kept together.

15:39.805 --> 15:42.485
The Vatican cannot let
these people be separated

15:42.565 --> 15:44.365
after all they've been through.

15:44.845 --> 15:49.045
Throughout the centuries,
the Vatican has let many things happen.

15:49.805 --> 15:52.765
But, at last, the air is finally changing.

15:54.525 --> 15:55.845
So where will you put them?

15:57.485 --> 15:59.485
Together with the local authorities,

15:59.565 --> 16:04.325
we're trying to come up
with the most dignified solution possible.

16:04.405 --> 16:05.845
Is there anything else?

16:08.845 --> 16:09.885
No, Your Eminence.

16:10.485 --> 16:12.085
Goodbye, madam.

16:14.965 --> 16:16.405
Thank you.

16:37.845 --> 16:39.365
I know where Livia Adami is.

16:40.125 --> 16:41.685
I'll take you there.

16:44.085 --> 16:47.245
Adelaide, you are
a respectable and intelligent woman.

16:47.845 --> 16:49.725
Tell me where she is
and don't piss me off.

16:50.165 --> 16:52.885
I want a guarantee about our deal,
then I'll tell you.

16:53.485 --> 16:55.365
You want guarantees for information?

16:56.445 --> 16:57.445
That's a bit much.

16:58.285 --> 16:59.965
It's what I want. I'm not negotiating.

17:05.765 --> 17:09.245
-Tell me where she is.
-In her own house. Her brother's got her.

17:11.405 --> 17:12.844
You can't trust him.

17:13.485 --> 17:18.205
We've always said so.
My son is in a coma because of him.

17:20.205 --> 17:22.005
You did the right thing, Adelaide.

17:22.364 --> 17:25.045
As soon as you've got her,
we'll discuss the rest.

17:36.845 --> 17:40.165
How come we couldn't find Livia Adami,
but the fucking Anacletis did?

17:40.245 --> 17:41.565
How's that possible?

17:44.365 --> 17:46.125
We can't trust Aureliano anymore.

17:47.325 --> 17:48.525
What do we do now?

17:49.245 --> 17:50.725
Let's go get the land, Saverio.

17:52.325 --> 17:55.245
-The Adami house is surrounded by guards.
-Yes, I know.

17:55.965 --> 17:57.405
But someone can give us a hand.

18:09.085 --> 18:11.405
-Aureliano, let me talk.
-Get out.

18:12.485 --> 18:14.205
Aureliano, I was scared.

18:14.285 --> 18:17.925
Aureliano, I was scared
Isabel would come between me and you.

18:18.005 --> 18:19.125
Aureliano, please!

18:19.205 --> 18:20.845
Let go of me, Aureliano!

18:20.925 --> 18:23.485
-Let go of me!
-Let go of you!

18:29.165 --> 18:31.485
Aureliano, please! Please!

18:55.885 --> 18:57.245
Get in.

18:57.325 --> 18:58.325
In!

19:01.165 --> 19:02.165
Wait!

19:02.245 --> 19:05.845
Wait! Before you shoot me,
I want to talk to you, that's all I ask.

19:07.205 --> 19:10.005
I know I don't deserve to live, Aureliano.

19:11.005 --> 19:13.445
But I want to die
knowing I asked you to forgive me.

19:14.845 --> 19:18.365
I didn't come back for business,
or for the port,

19:18.445 --> 19:20.165
or to convince you of anything.

19:20.885 --> 19:24.885
I only wanted to look you in the face
and tell you I'm disgusted by what I did.

19:27.685 --> 19:30.285
The last thing I wanted to do
was make you suffer.

19:33.725 --> 19:36.045
I loved you too much.

19:36.125 --> 19:41.005
And I never understood if you were a son,
a brother, a friend...

19:43.125 --> 19:44.965
And then you became my life.

19:46.125 --> 19:48.125
Dad never understood a fucking thing.

19:49.405 --> 19:54.405
You have to rule Ostia and all of Rome,
because you deserve it.

20:01.485 --> 20:02.765
Now you can shoot me.

20:35.565 --> 20:37.045
I can't do it.

20:50.965 --> 20:52.085
Get off.

20:52.165 --> 20:53.485
Get off!

21:34.645 --> 21:37.085
-What are you doing?
-I'm going to talk to my husband.

21:37.165 --> 21:39.405
No. We can't let anyone past.

21:39.765 --> 21:41.285
Are you jealous?

21:41.365 --> 21:43.845
You want to come too
and give him a little kiss?

21:54.565 --> 21:57.405
-Alberto!
-Open this door!

21:57.485 --> 21:59.965
How can I with your cousin standing guard?

22:01.325 --> 22:03.285
Angelica, I'm losing my mind. Find a way.

22:10.485 --> 22:12.325
You've got to hold on for a bit longer.

22:15.005 --> 22:17.205
I may have an idea
how to get you out of here.

22:27.845 --> 22:28.965
Here he is.

22:44.445 --> 22:46.685
You need a coffee. Come on, it's on me.

22:46.765 --> 22:47.765
No, thanks.

22:49.005 --> 22:51.685
Look, I need you alert and ready tonight.

22:51.765 --> 22:53.445
You've got to go to the Adami house.

22:54.085 --> 22:56.525
You've got to keep
all of the guards busy for me.

22:56.605 --> 22:58.245
They can't be inside the house.

22:59.445 --> 23:01.725
You don't get it,
I don't work for you anymore.

23:01.805 --> 23:03.965
No, you're the one who doesn't get it.

23:04.045 --> 23:06.165
You have to do whatever I tell you to do.

23:07.005 --> 23:09.125
You didn't bring me Livia yesterday.

23:09.205 --> 23:12.085
It's a miracle you're still alive,
do you understand me or not?

23:13.085 --> 23:15.325
Today you have to make up for that.
Is that clear?

23:17.205 --> 23:19.125
In two hours do what I told you to do.

23:54.045 --> 23:55.085
How are you?

23:57.005 --> 23:58.125
Good, now.

24:05.645 --> 24:06.925
Do you remember this?

24:17.765 --> 24:19.525
That day changed everything.

24:29.085 --> 24:31.085
I've been many things to you.

24:33.725 --> 24:35.045
But never a boss.

24:36.645 --> 24:37.565
I know.

24:42.885 --> 24:43.965
Stay here.

24:48.365 --> 24:49.405
Me and you.

24:52.845 --> 24:54.165
Against everyone.

25:38.245 --> 25:40.845
-Lele?
-Samurai's going to the Adami house.

25:43.365 --> 25:46.125
He's going to there to do something.
I need a hand.

25:47.365 --> 25:50.925
All right, all right.
Listen, I'll come up with something. Okay?

25:51.005 --> 25:52.165
Bye.

25:56.565 --> 25:57.485
Fuck!

25:59.965 --> 26:01.245
Fuck!

26:07.885 --> 26:10.005
Maybe you haven't noticed, but in Ostia

26:10.085 --> 26:12.765
there are business interests
of a certain sort at play.

26:12.845 --> 26:15.845
-Shouldn't Adriano just talk soccer?
- What I mean are the Vatican lands.

26:15.925 --> 26:18.565
They were sold three months ago
and nobody knows to whom.

26:18.645 --> 26:20.925
-Too many people listen to him.
- I was born in Ostia...

26:21.005 --> 26:24.565
Go tell him to keep his fucking mouth shut
about the land in Ostia.

26:24.645 --> 26:26.285
I love Ostia.

26:40.485 --> 26:44.125
-Where are the others?
-Shift's over, Inspector. They just left.

26:44.405 --> 26:45.725
Call them back. I need them now.

26:46.205 --> 26:47.925
-What's going on?
-You wanted action?

26:48.565 --> 26:50.805
Be outside with two officers
in five minutes.

27:06.445 --> 27:07.445
What do you want?

27:08.525 --> 27:12.165
First, to give you back your spare change.
I don't want your charity.

27:18.045 --> 27:20.045
Your father fucked up.
We had to deal with it.

27:20.125 --> 27:21.485
Leave my father out of it.

27:22.805 --> 27:24.165
Then why are you here?

27:26.725 --> 27:28.805
I want you to put me
at the head of my family.

27:33.045 --> 27:35.285
I found the drugs my dad stole from you.

27:35.885 --> 27:39.205
My cousins had them. I want to sell them.

27:39.285 --> 27:40.285
For you.

27:47.605 --> 27:48.805
You don't want to avenge him.

27:49.725 --> 27:51.365
You want to replace him?

27:51.965 --> 27:54.165
Look, my father was a piece of shit.

27:54.245 --> 27:56.045
I hate him even more now that he's gone,

27:56.125 --> 27:58.205
because he left me
in deeper shit than before.

27:59.405 --> 28:01.285
Then we've got something in common.

28:05.365 --> 28:06.565
So?

28:07.605 --> 28:11.405
Well, I don't get why I should put you
in your father's place.

28:12.005 --> 28:14.325
My cousins want to take over everything.

28:16.285 --> 28:18.005
Even the vendetta against you.

28:20.245 --> 28:21.765
I can't do it all myself, can I?

28:23.845 --> 28:25.765
You become a boss
all by yourself, little girl.

28:29.085 --> 28:30.165
Send her away.

28:31.045 --> 28:32.565
I haven't got time for this shit.

28:41.765 --> 28:43.565
Radio Roma Sport, good evening.

28:44.085 --> 28:46.045
Yes, I'll put you through now.

28:46.125 --> 28:47.525
Michele, you have a call.

28:48.245 --> 28:49.525
Line three.

29:01.765 --> 29:06.365
Now, I'll leave the line open for calls.
You have 30 seconds each.

29:06.445 --> 29:10.925
Remember, insults, profanity
and slander are forbidden.

29:11.005 --> 29:15.125
I know you want to vent your anger,
so do I, but you can't on the radio, so...

29:15.205 --> 29:18.325
I'm going to say goodbye now,
but as always I'll be back tomorrow

29:18.885 --> 29:21.205
with the latest football transfer news.

29:21.285 --> 29:22.285
Till then.

29:29.765 --> 29:32.245
So? Have you finished gossiping?

29:34.485 --> 29:37.445
You're not being very nice
towards the man who raised you.

29:37.525 --> 29:39.525
Have you forgotten all he's done for you?

29:40.005 --> 29:41.685
So he's sending his slave to talk to me?

29:43.205 --> 29:45.365
He hasn't got time
to waste on little kids.

29:45.445 --> 29:47.245
But you've got plenty of time to waste.

29:48.485 --> 29:50.445
Sorry, I've got to take a leak.

30:12.685 --> 30:14.565
Oh! Will you fix my necklace? It's...

30:15.285 --> 30:16.285
Thanks.

30:21.805 --> 30:23.165
You're so beautiful.

30:24.125 --> 30:25.165
I'm proud of you.

30:32.845 --> 30:35.365
Wait for me in the lobby
for a minute, please.

30:37.045 --> 30:38.045
Go in, darling.

30:47.685 --> 30:49.165
Did you have to come here?

30:53.685 --> 30:55.085
What's going on?

30:55.165 --> 30:57.965
You have to be a good soldier
and keep me informed.

30:58.445 --> 31:00.525
You're not working on your own.

31:00.845 --> 31:03.405
Why haven't you made a deal
with the Left yet?

31:03.485 --> 31:05.325
Because we risk looking like fools.

31:05.925 --> 31:07.805
It's like they're living on the moon.

31:08.605 --> 31:11.405
-They don't get what the people want.
-What are you saying?

31:11.845 --> 31:13.845
That they're going to lose the election.

31:14.325 --> 31:16.085
People are afraid.

31:16.925 --> 31:19.445
They want answers
and they don't have them.

31:19.725 --> 31:23.005
We've done business with them
and we'll keep doing business with them.

31:24.805 --> 31:26.565
They won't be governing.

31:27.245 --> 31:31.285
You got those votes with my help.
You'll give them to whomever I say, okay?

31:35.725 --> 31:39.485
I won't flush my votes down the toilet
by supporting the wrong candidate.

31:47.845 --> 31:49.885
Better wrong than dead.

31:53.045 --> 31:55.165
Think about that
when you're with the Countess.

32:20.325 --> 32:22.925
Hey, get a move on,
we're praying for Manfredi.

32:24.565 --> 32:25.685
[in Sinti] [Let's go.]

32:54.925 --> 32:56.045
Well done, kid.

33:13.085 --> 33:15.005
Your Eminence, why did you call me?

33:15.085 --> 33:16.525
Ah, Mrs. Monaschi.

33:16.605 --> 33:18.085
What's going on?

33:18.165 --> 33:22.365
You were right, the migrants that arrived
have the right to stay together.

33:22.725 --> 33:23.965
At least the families.

33:24.645 --> 33:26.245
You've set up a refugee camp here?

33:26.845 --> 33:28.645
-On the Ostia land?
-Yes.

33:28.725 --> 33:31.325
And local authorities
are ready to entrust it to you.

33:31.845 --> 33:34.325
But these lands
no longer belong to the Holy See.

33:34.405 --> 33:38.365
It's not our property anymore,
but you know Italian bureaucracy.

33:38.445 --> 33:42.445
The property transfer
hasn't technically been finalized yet.

33:42.525 --> 33:45.285
We're going to take advantage of that,
and force things a bit.

33:45.725 --> 33:49.285
Your Eminence,
enormous interests are involved here

33:49.365 --> 33:51.285
and someone might get offended.

33:51.365 --> 33:54.285
And believe me, it's not someone
you want to have dealings with.

33:54.725 --> 33:57.765
Do we allow
the powerful to intimidate us, Sara?

33:58.685 --> 34:01.645
And who will defend these poor creatures?

34:02.765 --> 34:06.085
Do you know to whom this land belongs?
Why do you want to put them here?

34:06.165 --> 34:08.245
Because they have nowhere else to go.

34:09.525 --> 34:11.445
They'll stay together,

34:11.525 --> 34:15.965
until we find
more suitable accommodations.

34:18.285 --> 34:20.405
I thought you cared about these people.

34:21.085 --> 34:24.204
You and your association will have
complete control over the management,

34:24.724 --> 34:26.565
operational and financial.

34:33.125 --> 34:34.684
All right.

34:34.765 --> 34:36.125
I'm glad.

34:37.005 --> 34:38.845
Yes, of course.

34:42.684 --> 34:44.285
How did you find out?

34:44.365 --> 34:45.765
An informer.

34:47.204 --> 34:49.204
Three months
and you've already got informers?

34:49.965 --> 34:51.805
He's someone
who used to talk to my father.

34:54.565 --> 34:56.085
What exactly did he tell you?

34:57.244 --> 35:00.244
He was at an exchange, and the car
with the drugs in it is at the Adami's.

35:00.845 --> 35:01.845
Fuck!

35:03.245 --> 35:05.445
How can we search the place
without a warrant?

35:05.525 --> 35:09.165
You can't always do things by the book,
especially with people like the Adamis.

35:09.525 --> 35:13.285
-So what do you plan on doing?
-I'll try to get inside during the check.

35:13.925 --> 35:15.285
-Alone?
-Yes.

35:20.405 --> 35:22.365
You're the only agent I'd take with me,

35:22.765 --> 35:25.285
but I need you outside, all right?

35:27.805 --> 35:28.805
All right.

35:57.805 --> 35:59.325
The police are outside.

35:59.405 --> 36:02.085
They say they want
to identify everyone in the house.

36:04.845 --> 36:06.965
The police, that's all we needed now.

36:15.925 --> 36:17.925
If I'm not at home, they can't come in.

36:19.245 --> 36:22.725
You go out, they've seen you anyway.
Leave Gianluca back here.

36:29.445 --> 36:31.085
-They're coming out.
-Good.

36:31.165 --> 36:34.045
Ask for IDs and radio in their names.
Play for time.

36:57.445 --> 36:59.605
-The owner of the house isn't in?
-No.

37:01.085 --> 37:02.885
What are you doing here without Mr. Adami?

37:03.805 --> 37:05.205
We're guests.

37:09.165 --> 37:11.205
I need to see IDs, from everyone.

37:51.365 --> 37:52.365
Livia!

37:54.805 --> 37:56.325
Livia!

37:56.405 --> 37:57.525
Quiet!

37:57.885 --> 37:59.245
Shut up!

38:00.045 --> 38:02.925
Did you really think I wouldn't find out
that Livia was here?

38:08.605 --> 38:10.605
Maybe now you'll keep your word.

38:11.885 --> 38:13.925
-Hey!
-What the fuck took so long?

38:14.725 --> 38:17.285
-I came as quick as I could.
-Hurry up!

38:20.045 --> 38:22.445
Sign it, Livia,
or I blow a hole in your brother's head.

38:42.925 --> 38:44.445
You wanted to keep my land.

38:46.725 --> 38:48.285
What were you going to do then?

38:53.405 --> 38:55.725
It's finished.
I've taken everything from you.

38:56.525 --> 38:59.325
Now try to rule over
the nothing you've got left.

39:03.405 --> 39:05.365
You can take all the land you want.

39:08.525 --> 39:11.245
As long as we're here, Ostia is ours.

39:26.045 --> 39:27.525
Oh! God!

39:29.045 --> 39:30.045
Oh, God!

39:30.125 --> 39:31.605
What the fuck have you done?

39:32.125 --> 39:34.965
Look at me! I'm here. Hold on…

39:44.045 --> 39:45.085
No!

39:47.045 --> 39:48.285
Look at me.

39:49.085 --> 39:51.645
Talk to me. Livia, please, Livia.

39:53.645 --> 39:55.765
Now I've taken everything from you.

39:56.765 --> 39:58.765
You're on your own, Aureliano.

39:58.845 --> 40:00.885
And on your own, you're not worth shit.

41:56.365 --> 41:57.965
Whose cars are those?

41:58.045 --> 42:00.085
Ours and the owner of the house's.

42:00.165 --> 42:01.405
Who isn't here.

42:02.285 --> 42:04.485
Officer, how much longer
do we have to stay here?

42:05.245 --> 42:06.765
As long as it takes.

42:06.845 --> 42:09.565
Are you sure
everything you're doing is by the book?

42:10.245 --> 42:11.525
This is private property.

42:11.885 --> 42:13.245
Officer, we can go.

42:14.845 --> 42:16.685
We're not done yet, Inspector.

42:21.445 --> 42:23.245
There's no need. Let's go.

42:25.845 --> 42:27.205
Let's go!

44:03.845 --> 44:06.285
