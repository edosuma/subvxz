- We're shopping for cars now?

Yeah, how else am I
supposed to get to work?

00:06.718 --> 00:08.758
Being an ugly black woman
has absolutely nothing

00:08.759 --> 00:10.758

have been stifled by society.</i>

00:13.634 --> 00:15.258

would bring some much needed

just be two friends</i>

00:24.718 --> 00:28.675
It feels good to know that I
contributed to your success.

00:28.676 --> 00:31.675
What kind of compensation
might a woman expect?

00:31.676 --> 00:33.341
Did I miss the memo about the meeting?

00:33.342 --> 00:35.758
No, no, Marisol was simply
telling me her ideas.

00:35.759 --> 00:38.841
Here at SNC you don't go
pitching stories to the Boss

00:38.842 --> 00:40.799

when you're sleeping with him.</i>

00:40.800 --> 00:42.466
Excuse me?

00:42.467 --> 00:46.258
You are telling me that you
have never been with a white boy?

00:46.259 --> 00:47.383
- 'Never.'
- 'Seriously?'

movie theaters or like...

01:00.509 --> 01:03.450

- Secret, huh?

01:04.967 --> 01:08.717
Give me some dates and I'll
make a plan for us, alright?

01:08.718 --> 01:10.008

This is terribly presumptuous
and a little off etiquette

02:38.676 --> 02:41.299
but I... I just had to see you.

02:41.300 --> 02:46.174
Yeah, well to say I'm surprised
would be an understatement.

02:46.175 --> 02:48.758
Well, just because you and
David aren't together anymore

02:48.759 --> 02:51.216
and don't get me started on that

02:51.217 --> 02:53.133
it doesn't mean that you and
I can't have a proper hello

02:53.134 --> 02:54.758

02:54.759 --> 02:57.675
Right. How are you? I
mean, it's great to see you.

Congratulations.

03:09.967 --> 03:11.882
Yeah, it's kind of a pretentious name.

03:11.883 --> 03:13.550
You kind of feel the mother's influence.

03:13.551 --> 03:16.174
Okay. No, no, I can't do it.

03:16.175 --> 03:18.133
I can't, I cannot do this with you.

03:18.134 --> 03:21.091
Simone, I, I was
actually kind of curious

03:21.092 --> 03:23.341
why you came over here,
but I... I don't care.

03:23.342 --> 03:26.299
I ca-I can't do it. I cannot
do this with you. I am sorry.

03:26.300 --> 03:29.091
I know, this, this is, you've
been through an awful lot.

03:29.092 --> 03:31.341
And you're just gonna make
me... Aren't you? Okay.

03:31.342 --> 03:34.118
Look, David still loves you.

03:34.384 --> 03:36.466
He never stopped.

03:36.467 --> 03:40.924
You know... life is short
and-and I don't expect you

03:40.925 --> 03:43.633
to recover from your situation overnight

03:43.634 --> 03:47.049
but David knows he messed up

03:47.050 --> 03:48.966
and this-this... this Lisa thing

03:48.967 --> 03:51.675
oh, honey, I-I... What
do you say about that?

03:51.676 --> 03:54.425
I mean, what, what do you say?

03:54.426 --> 03:57.383
But David still loves you

03:57.384 --> 03:59.258
and he is beyond sorry

03:59.259 --> 04:03.659
and-and neither one of us
wanted to see you end this way.

But, you know, we know that
maybe you won't get together

04:08.883 --> 04:12.966
again, but I don't want
to see it end in anger.

04:12.967 --> 04:16.632
You know, don't move on just
thinking the worst of him.

saying the same thing

Mary Jane because that's,
that's-that's all I have.

04:22.009 --> 04:24.091
Yeah, but this groveling
mother just wants you

04:24.092 --> 04:26.508
to forgive her son.

04:26.509 --> 04:28.882
- Would you?
- Hm?

04:28.883 --> 04:31.283
Forgive your son, if you were me?

04:32.467 --> 04:35.091
- Would I...
- No, you wouldn't.

04:35.092 --> 04:38.591
Simone, at, at no point in your
drive over here did you just

04:38.592 --> 04:42.174
stop and think, maybe I should
leave this woman alone because

04:42.175 --> 04:43.924
she's been through enough.

04:43.925 --> 04:46.174
'No, you just want what you want'

04:46.175 --> 04:48.758
'and to hell with anyone else's pain.'

04:48.759 --> 04:51.283
Screw me, right?

04:52.634 --> 04:55.508
Okay, well, I guess I'll go.

04:55.509 --> 04:58.091
I'll let you get back to your company.

04:58.092 --> 05:00.675
You know, David didn't
drive you to women, did he?

05:00.676 --> 05:02.758
Because that's kind of a girly car.

05:02.759 --> 05:04.008
Really?

05:04.009 --> 05:07.049
Look, you don't have
to insult my intentions!

05:07.050 --> 05:10.133
I am sorry your friend
committed suicide, I am

05:10.134 --> 05:13.283
but David is alive and-and
we all deserve forgiveness.

05:14.509 --> 05:16.133
You just can't stop, can you?

05:16.134 --> 05:17.966
And you can't see that I'm
trying to bridge a gap here.

05:17.967 --> 05:21.425
And you can't see that it's over!

05:21.426 --> 05:25.675
It's over, Simone, okay?

05:25.676 --> 05:27.550
And, and the painful
thing about break-ups

05:27.551 --> 05:30.299
is you gotta let go of people and dreams

05:30.300 --> 05:32.882
and plans and behavior.

Your handout talking about,
oh, ain't nobody that friendly.

06:42.718 --> 06:44.174

06:45.759 --> 06:47.425
that cares about the black community.

06:47.426 --> 06:51.216
I know many of you have had some
thought-provoking conversations

06:51.217 --> 06:54.258
with Miracle's own beloved Cece Briggs

06:54.259 --> 06:56.216
and I'm sure those
conversations were one-sided

06:56.217 --> 06:58.882
because we all know how
much that lady loves to talk.

06:58.883 --> 07:00.508
Well, I am beyond grateful.

07:00.509 --> 07:01.924
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

07:01.925 --> 07:03.717
The sad thing is even with all this

07:03.718 --> 07:05.924
I don't know if I'm gonna be
able to keep this place open.

07:05.925 --> 07:07.133
Can you please stop trying to turn me

07:07.134 --> 07:08.508
into your own personal ATM?

07:08.509 --> 07:10.508
Alright, I'm working on it.

07:10.509 --> 07:13.882

this is a genuine</i>

07:13.883 --> 07:17.174
thank you unattached to the hustle.

07:17.175 --> 07:22.383
But Cece... she has information
that she is compelled to share

07:22.384 --> 07:25.758
about the many injustices that
our communities are still being

07:25.759 --> 07:27.049
confronted with on a daily basis

07:27.050 --> 07:29.133
Speaking of, I think I might've

07:29.134 --> 07:31.882
stumbled upon a payday
for the both of us.

07:31.883 --> 07:33.882
- What's the catch?
- No catch.

07:33.883 --> 07:35.758
I-I met with a publisher the other day

07:35.759 --> 07:37.174
and they want me to write a book.

07:37.175 --> 07:38.591
Oh, congratulations.

07:38.592 --> 07:40.216
Yeah. Hi.

07:40.217 --> 07:43.049
Yeah, they want a, a memoir of sorts

07:43.050 --> 07:46.258
something, you know,
personal from my life...

07:46.259 --> 07:47.758
Ah, thank you.

07:47.759 --> 07:50.091
That targets the black demographic.

07:50.092 --> 07:54.008
Oh, well I don't see how
I come into it, but...

07:54.009 --> 07:56.425
What could be more
personal than how we met?

07:56.426 --> 07:59.466
I mean, granted, extortion is
not the most common way into

07:59.467 --> 08:03.299
a friendship, but I mean if you
think about what led us to that

08:03.300 --> 08:07.591
pivotal moment, the hardship,
the despair, the, the heartache.

08:07.592 --> 08:09.049
- Uh.
- Right?

08:09.050 --> 08:11.425
We've spoken a lot today about the need

08:11.426 --> 08:15.450
to take back control of
our communities, right?

08:16.467 --> 08:18.383
But in order to do that we need

08:18.384 --> 08:21.383
the tools to inspire...

08:21.384 --> 08:23.717
not only for ourselves,
but for, for generations

08:23.718 --> 08:26.882
of black children to come...

08:26.883 --> 08:28.383
and we need to look no further than

08:28.384 --> 08:32.383

10:14.718 --> 10:16.966
or speakin' up for black women?

10:16.967 --> 10:20.133
So she went from callin'
herself a ugly black woman

10:20.134 --> 10:23.383
to dating a gorgeous white guy?

10:23.384 --> 10:24.966
I see, Mary Jane.

10:24.967 --> 10:26.841
Alright, now this picture has gone viral

10:26.842 --> 10:28.799
and not everybody is feeling her.

10:28.800 --> 10:31.008
Hypocrite is a term
that they're using a lot.

10:31.009 --> 10:32.924
Personally, I think
black women always get

10:32.925 --> 10:34.633
the shorter end of the stick on this.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.258
Brothers have been datin'
outside their race for years

10:37.259 --> 10:40.675
and although we give a
little... that makes sisters too.

10:40.676 --> 10:43.341
I mean, nobody gets the
flack like a black woman

10:43.342 --> 10:45.008
when she steps out on the race.

10:45.009 --> 10:46.367
(APPLAUSE)

10:47.967 --> 10:49.717
Tamara, I wanna ask you 'cause I know

10:49.718 --> 10:51.633
'you've been very vocal
about your relationship.'

10:51.634 --> 10:55.216
Do you think that black
women are judged more harshly?

10:55.217 --> 10:56.591
Well, as you guys know, I'm a product

10:56.592 --> 10:58.591
of an interracial relationship, and...

10:58.592 --> 11:00.341
- Would've never guessed it.
- 'Right.'

11:00.342 --> 11:01.966
(LAUGHTER)

11:01.967 --> 11:05.049
And I'm a partner in an
interracial relationship.

11:05.050 --> 11:06.882
You know I love Adam. Hi, Adam.

11:06.883 --> 11:08.675
'I definitely had, you know'

11:08.676 --> 11:10.882
people unfairly pass judgment

11:10.883 --> 11:13.591
but I, I don't wanna
be the resident expert

11:13.592 --> 11:16.341
on interracial dating. I
mean, I don't know everything.

11:16.342 --> 11:20.008
So audience, what do you guys
think? Let's hear from you.

11:20.009 --> 11:23.091
Are we still tripping on
interracial relationships?

11:23.092 --> 11:24.591
You want me to do what?

11:24.592 --> 11:26.550
Come on, I think it's a good thing.

11:26.551 --> 11:30.882
Need I remind you of my failed
egg freezing on national TV.

11:30.883 --> 11:32.174
That was different, this is now.

11:32.175 --> 11:35.758
It's still my personal life. No.

11:35.759 --> 11:37.633
The show's not even ready anyway.

11:37.634 --> 11:39.466
Yes, it is.

11:39.467 --> 11:41.299
You're just happy they said SNC on air.

11:41.300 --> 11:44.341
Oh, I am and you, as in we

11:44.342 --> 11:47.383
need to respond with an in-depth
look on where we are with

11:47.384 --> 11:49.758
interracial relationships
in this country.

11:49.759 --> 11:52.508
'They basically posed the
question for you, Mary Jane.'

11:52.509 --> 11:55.283
Oh, and their social
networking tracking on this, oh!

11:57.384 --> 11:59.966
It was bananas.

11:59.967 --> 12:04.633
Look, Greg, a show like this
down the line, absolutely.

12:04.634 --> 12:07.008
But I do not want to relaunch "talkBACK"

12:07.009 --> 12:09.591
with my personal life. I'm
sure you can respect that.

12:09.592 --> 12:12.550
Okay, I wanted to avoid this,
but I figured since I gave you

12:12.551 --> 12:13.882
your show back to you you owed me

12:13.883 --> 12:18.383
a few favors so I am
pulling one of my cards.

12:18.384 --> 12:19.508
One of your cards?

12:19.509 --> 12:20.717
- Mm-hm.
- Caught that.

12:20.718 --> 12:22.591
Hey, we've been handed a gift here.

12:22.592 --> 12:26.575
I want you on the air addressing
this to relaunch "talkBACK."

12:31.467 --> 12:33.034
Okay.

12:34.883 --> 12:36.742
Thank you.

12:52.134 --> 12:53.882
I read it's not good for women to stand

12:53.883 --> 12:56.216
in front of the microwave.

12:56.217 --> 12:57.951
Hurts our ovaries.

13:02.426 --> 13:05.284
- Hey, Marisol, I...
- All yours.

13:10.883 --> 13:12.425
What's up, crusaders?

13:12.426 --> 13:16.091
I'm telling you the NFL,
NBA, NHL, MLB, they're beasts.

13:16.092 --> 13:17.383
They are masters of extorting

13:17.384 --> 13:19.341
taxpayers to build their stadiums.

13:19.342 --> 13:20.717
The numbers are astonishing.

13:20.718 --> 13:22.591
I'll have it ready by
the next staff report.

13:22.592 --> 13:24.550
Oh, and I've just been
counting dead black bodies

13:24.551 --> 13:26.133
at the hands of police.

13:26.134 --> 13:27.425
You know, I got Rashad Robinson from

13:27.426 --> 13:28.882
Color of Change on the hook.

13:28.883 --> 13:31.174
Now, he is crazy busy, but I'm sure

13:31.175 --> 13:33.492
we can make it happen
for the first show.

13:34.384 --> 13:36.758
About that, uh...

13:36.759 --> 13:39.174
we gotta switch it up.

13:39.175 --> 13:43.258
Greg wants to relaunch
"talkBACK" doing a...

13:43.259 --> 13:46.717
a State of the Union on
interracial relationships.

13:46.718 --> 13:48.341
Because you're dating that white guy?

13:48.342 --> 13:51.591
Don't start. Look, I know, we just...

13:51.592 --> 13:54.174
- We just have to do it.
- Wow. Okay.

13:54.175 --> 13:56.258
You know, I didn't sign
up to do the fluff pieces.

13:56.259 --> 13:59.966
And anyone else would've fired
your ass for what you just said.

13:59.967 --> 14:03.425
But I have decided that
mentoring will be, uh, the means

14:03.426 --> 14:06.299
to supplement your meager paychecks.

14:06.300 --> 14:08.008
Lesson number one.

14:08.009 --> 14:10.508
This is life. Deal with it.

14:10.509 --> 14:12.383
'When someone gives you a
paycheck, you figure out'

14:12.384 --> 14:14.258
how to give them what they
want by saying what you want.

14:14.259 --> 14:18.534
So what do you want to say
about interracial relationships?

14:24.175 --> 14:25.882
Seven-one thousand.

14:25.883 --> 14:28.299
Eight-one thousand.

14:28.300 --> 14:31.366
(CHUCKLING) Nine-one thousand.

14:31.592 --> 14:33.159
Ten.

14:34.676 --> 14:36.091
Where's my baby?

14:36.092 --> 14:37.591
There's my baby.

14:37.592 --> 14:39.508
You suck at hiding, kid.

14:39.509 --> 14:42.550
You suck at hiding! Come here!

14:42.551 --> 14:44.341
You suck at hiding! You are so bad!

14:44.342 --> 14:46.008
PAUL: 'Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!'

14:46.009 --> 14:48.091
What did I tell you about
running in the house, huh?

14:48.092 --> 14:49.700
FEMALE 1: 'Come here.'

14:50.676 --> 14:52.049
- You hear grandpa?
- Hmm.

14:52.050 --> 14:53.758
No running.

14:53.759 --> 14:56.508
I'm sorry. I know you're trying
to keep it quiet for grandma.

14:56.509 --> 14:58.675
It's okay, it's okay.

14:58.676 --> 15:00.882
Just kids giving us
something else to do.

15:00.883 --> 15:02.258
Yeah.

15:02.259 --> 15:04.174
Hey, why don't you go
get ready for your nap.

15:04.175 --> 15:05.466
I'll bring up some apple juice, okay?

15:05.467 --> 15:07.299
- Okay.
- Okay.

15:07.300 --> 15:08.633
You suck at hide and seek, kid.

15:08.634 --> 15:10.466
'Mm-hm.'

15:10.467 --> 15:11.508
You silly.

15:11.509 --> 15:13.425
(SIGHS)

15:13.426 --> 15:16.700
Um... has he talked to my dad at all?

15:18.342 --> 15:20.758
- No.
- Are you, are you sure?

15:20.759 --> 15:22.466
Have you talked to my dad at all?

15:22.467 --> 15:24.049
(WHISPERING) No.

15:24.050 --> 15:26.216
The only thing I got was
a text saying I love you

15:26.217 --> 15:27.951
and that was it.

15:29.883 --> 15:32.133
You want the car section?

15:32.134 --> 15:33.882
I heard that your uncle
is going to buy you one.

15:33.883 --> 15:35.341
Yeah, he is.

15:35.342 --> 15:38.008
Well, make him do it.

15:38.009 --> 15:40.882
Pops, I said I'd get her a
car before I went back to LA.

15:40.883 --> 15:43.174
Before is now.

15:43.175 --> 15:46.383
Yep, there's no time
like the present, unc.

15:46.384 --> 15:48.882
Well, I'm gonna go lay her
down since she's asleep.

15:48.883 --> 15:50.575
I'm ready to go.

15:54.300 --> 15:56.216
I'm proud of you, son.

15:56.217 --> 15:57.882
For what?

15:57.883 --> 15:59.675
Well, she deserves to know how it feels

15:59.676 --> 16:02.966
to have a man show up for her.

16:02.967 --> 16:04.882
Dad, Patrick's there for her.

16:04.883 --> 16:07.383
You just can't see it.

16:07.384 --> 16:09.758
Well, for now...

16:09.759 --> 16:12.159
let her see you. How about that?

16:14.009 --> 16:16.008
I'll see you later.

16:16.009 --> 16:18.283
(SIGHS)

16:26.592 --> 16:28.758
- Hi, Greg.
- I need to talk to you.

16:28.759 --> 16:30.466
Yeah, sure. You want some popcorn?

16:30.467 --> 16:31.591
There's no butter, but
it's still good anyway.

16:31.592 --> 16:33.992
We should meet in private.

16:38.509 --> 16:40.882
'So what's going on?'

16:40.883 --> 16:43.341
Am I about to be fired or something?

16:43.342 --> 16:46.091
Not at this point... yet.

16:46.092 --> 16:47.633
Yet?

16:47.634 --> 16:51.425
Did you or did you not
accuse Marisol of having

16:51.426 --> 16:53.008
an affair with me?

16:53.009 --> 16:55.633
What? Wh-what are you talking about?

16:55.634 --> 16:58.341
Did you or did you not

16:58.342 --> 17:01.882
accuse Marisol of
having an affair with me?

17:01.883 --> 17:03.550
No! No!

17:03.551 --> 17:04.882
Greg, wait a minute, Greg.

17:04.883 --> 17:07.758
Greg, you know, you know this is crap!

17:07.759 --> 17:09.258
- What the hell, Kara?
- I'm sorry!

17:09.259 --> 17:10.717
- Sorry?
- Yes.

17:10.718 --> 17:12.258
- I don't need I'm sorry.
- Wait a minute.

17:12.259 --> 17:15.965
I need you to go down to HR
and clear my name of this.

17:15.967 --> 17:18.717
- You are smarter than this.
- This is not how it went down.

17:18.718 --> 17:20.215
Listen to me. What did she say?

17:20.217 --> 17:21.965
- She came to me.
- Yeah.

17:21.967 --> 17:25.882
Because she wants to file a
complaint against you to HR.

17:25.883 --> 17:28.550
She's ensigning you for intimidation

17:28.550 --> 17:30.633
publicly disparaging her character

17:30.634 --> 17:33.508
and accusing her of having
an affair with her superior.

17:33.509 --> 17:34.966
- Me!
- No!

17:34.967 --> 17:36.882
To better her standing with the company.

17:36.883 --> 17:38.341
Oh, my God, no!

17:38.342 --> 17:42.575
You need to fix this... now!

17:45.592 --> 17:47.591
I know you don't wanna
hear it, but I think

17:47.592 --> 17:50.425
you should just sit
down and talk to her.

17:50.426 --> 17:52.882
- Talk to her?
- Yeah.

17:52.883 --> 17:55.966
Hell, no. She broke the code.

17:55.967 --> 17:59.341
She did not have to take this to Greg.

17:59.342 --> 18:02.299
Man, when I was working my
way up, you know how much crap

18:02.300 --> 18:06.882
I had to put up with from
male co-workers and supervisors

18:06.883 --> 18:09.466
and this bitch, Karen, who
thought I was after her.

18:09.467 --> 18:11.758
'If I would've gone to HR every
time something inappropriate'

18:11.759 --> 18:13.383
went on, do you actually think

18:13.384 --> 18:15.299
they would've ever taken me seriously?

18:15.300 --> 18:17.882
MARY JANE: 'I know,
I know, but these kids'

18:17.883 --> 18:19.091
they're of a different generation.

18:19.092 --> 18:22.258
They, they have no boundaries at all.

18:22.259 --> 18:26.591
I-I hired this girl, Nina,
and, man, she says stuff I would

18:26.592 --> 18:29.008
never have the guts to say

18:29.009 --> 18:30.882
which is probably why
I like her so much.

18:30.883 --> 18:32.758
'Yeah, they, they have no filter.'

18:32.759 --> 18:34.924
They just... blh-lh-lh,
they say whatever.

18:34.925 --> 18:37.633
No, what they don't have is loyalty...

18:37.634 --> 18:40.091
and they don't know
anything about paying dues

18:40.092 --> 18:42.966
'and working stuff out
like adults, you know?'

18:42.967 --> 18:45.550
If she had an issue with
me, she should've came to me

18:45.551 --> 18:48.076
like a grown-ass woman.

18:51.967 --> 18:56.284
So... what does she
have on you exactly?

19:00.883 --> 19:04.408
It's just... one thing.

19:05.009 --> 19:06.826
One thing.

19:07.259 --> 19:09.216
Weeks ago.

19:09.217 --> 19:10.882
And I regret it.

19:10.883 --> 19:13.383
I regret it.

19:13.384 --> 19:18.867
She's gotta come up here with
her sexuality... even flirting.

19:20.384 --> 19:22.909
Oh, she made me so mad...

19:24.467 --> 19:26.450
so mad!

19:29.009 --> 19:30.882
Man, I even said to
myself, you know what?

19:30.883 --> 19:33.258
Maybe I shoulda teased a little ass

19:33.259 --> 19:36.091
and gotten myself a little
further a hell of a lot faster.

19:36.092 --> 19:37.882
- You know what I'm saying?
- I do.

19:37.883 --> 19:39.258
- Shoot.
- And you should tell her that.

19:39.259 --> 19:42.258
Tell her exactly that,
just tell the truth.

19:42.259 --> 19:46.284
Apologize and see, see if the
whole thing just goes away.

19:51.050 --> 19:54.034
I hate to grovel.

20:01.342 --> 20:04.924
It's been 48 years since the
historic Supreme Court decision

20:04.925 --> 20:08.091
Loving versus Virginia
ruled anti-misogynation laws

20:08.092 --> 20:10.425
state sanctioned bans
on interracial marriage

20:10.426 --> 20:12.425
unconstitutional.

20:12.426 --> 20:15.466
Some might say interracial
dating is no longer taboo.

20:15.467 --> 20:18.508
There are plenty of examples of
interracial couples in society.

20:18.509 --> 20:21.258
And in most American cities
walking down the street with

20:21.259 --> 20:24.882
a partner of another race won't
pose the same degree of a threat

20:24.883 --> 20:27.341
<i>as it might have 50 years ago.</i>

20:27.342 --> 20:31.174
<i>In fact, a recent Gallup
poll estimates that 87% of</i>

20:31.175 --> 20:34.216
Americans now favor marriage
between blacks and whites

20:34.217 --> 20:37.924
up from just 4% in 1958.

20:37.925 --> 20:40.841
But have attitudes truly
changed or have the spaces for

20:40.842 --> 20:44.034
controversial conversations
simply shifted?

20:45.092 --> 20:47.675
You are the second black
woman I've ever dated that

20:47.676 --> 20:50.008
over-analyzed every
move she makes at work.

20:50.009 --> 20:51.924
Or her entire life for that matter.

20:51.925 --> 20:54.299
- You understand why, don't you?
- No.

20:54.300 --> 20:57.909
It's exhausting and draining
and a complete waste of time.

20:58.509 --> 21:01.299
You don't understand.

21:01.300 --> 21:03.075
Please enlighten me.

21:03.342 --> 21:05.008
I don't want to.

21:05.009 --> 21:08.174
I don't wanna have to explain to you

21:08.175 --> 21:11.299
why as a woman of color I
have to over-analyze everything

21:11.300 --> 21:14.966
that I do at work or
explain what my kitchen is.

21:14.967 --> 21:17.508
Not that kitchen which
is precisely my point.

21:17.509 --> 21:21.299
In 2014, Cheerios released a
commercial where an adorable kid

21:21.300 --> 21:24.216
'poured cereal over her sleeping
father's chest because her'

21:24.217 --> 21:27.091
mother had told her Cheerios
were good for the heart.

21:27.092 --> 21:29.633
That seemingly innocuous
commercial was considered

21:29.634 --> 21:34.049
controversial after YouTube was
flooded with racist comments.

21:34.050 --> 21:37.550
'The child was bi-racial,
the father was black'

21:37.551 --> 21:39.882
and the mother was white.

21:39.883 --> 21:43.966
I take no pleasure in saying
this which is maybe why I tried

21:43.967 --> 21:45.508
to delay us going out in the first place

21:45.509 --> 21:48.882
but I can't date you anymore.

21:48.883 --> 21:50.717
- What?
- I'm sorry.

21:50.718 --> 21:52.675
- Are you serious?
- 'Yeah.'

21:52.676 --> 21:54.091
- Wow.
- Yeah.

21:54.092 --> 21:55.633
Wow.

21:55.634 --> 21:59.174
In 2015, popular British
singer FKA Twigs became

21:59.175 --> 22:01.717
engaged to Twilight
actor Robert Pattinson.

22:01.718 --> 22:05.425
'Twigs, who is mixed race, faced
online harassment via Twitter'

22:05.426 --> 22:08.508
from those who claimed to
be Pattinson's biggest fans.

22:08.509 --> 22:11.008
In an interview with the
New York Times, Twigs spoke

22:11.009 --> 22:13.174
of the experience,
saying it's relentless.

22:13.175 --> 22:15.882
'There's no amount of
songs I can sing or dances'

22:15.883 --> 22:19.383
I can dance that will prove
to them I'm not a monkey.

22:19.384 --> 22:21.717
Just because you did a bid in
the Peace Corps or you've got

22:21.718 --> 22:23.133
some black friends doesn't make

22:23.134 --> 22:25.882
you any more understanding or cultured.

22:25.883 --> 22:27.758
At what point do I get an understanding?

22:27.759 --> 22:29.550
I mean that's just it, you can't.

22:29.551 --> 22:31.091
I mean not fully.

22:31.092 --> 22:33.882
We spent an hour debating
why the black couple

22:33.883 --> 22:36.133
at the karaoke bar bothered me so much.

22:36.134 --> 22:37.508
You don't even know if
they were judging you.

22:37.509 --> 22:40.882
You're right, I don't, but
I cared and it consumed me

22:40.883 --> 22:44.299
and it was exhausting, and
I am exhausted right now.

22:44.300 --> 22:47.299
I can't always be the person
that explains this stuff to you.

22:47.300 --> 22:50.075
But yet in your job you
spend all day explaining it.

22:52.883 --> 22:56.049
I have a lot of struggles in my life

22:56.050 --> 22:59.283
that I did not ask for
and I did not create.

23:00.009 --> 23:02.299
You and I is not a struggle

23:02.300 --> 23:05.675
that I'm gonna choose for myself, okay?

23:05.676 --> 23:07.383
The relentless of the Internet

23:07.384 --> 23:10.091
allows for hate to flood timelines.

23:10.092 --> 23:12.008
Some just call it trolling.

23:12.009 --> 23:15.425
Others call it truth without a filter.

23:15.426 --> 23:17.451
I like black men.

23:19.009 --> 23:21.508
I want black love.

23:21.509 --> 23:23.283
Well...

23:24.883 --> 23:26.675
I surrender.

23:26.676 --> 23:29.550
I can't give you that.

allows us to hide behind our

23:32.259 --> 23:35.508

into the public versus private'

Yes, that's right, so...

31:28.250 --> 31:32.374
No, it actually all
started in the ER hallway.

I, like most entrepreneurs in
this country trying to scrape

31:35.417 --> 31:37.875
together a living, was putting
every dollar I had back in

my business to keep it afloat.

31:41.083 --> 31:44.833

let my health insurance lapse

31:44.834 --> 31:46.875

31:46.876 --> 31:50.958
no room, no solution to the situation.

31:53.375 --> 31:57.082
(CHUCKLING) I might be still
waiting in that hallway.

31:57.083 --> 31:59.374
Why, I just knew that the check
would mean more to her than it

31:59.375 --> 32:01.082
does to me, so I thought it
was the right thing to do.

32:01.083 --> 32:05.166
And then SNC tried to buy my silence

32:05.167 --> 32:08.458
but I knew once that

32:14.876 --> 32:17.249
the black man, in this case woman

32:17.250 --> 32:20.917
for a fall and I was not
gonna let that happen.

32:20.918 --> 32:23.082
So why'd you let her do it, Mary Jane?

32:23.083 --> 32:24.416
I mean, you weren't legally drunk.

32:24.417 --> 32:26.917
Why? I know why.

32:26.918 --> 32:29.082
'The thought of a black
woman losing her job'

32:29.083 --> 32:30.583
she'll do damn near anything.

32:30.584 --> 32:31.625
(CHUCKLES)

32:31.626 --> 32:33.208
That's her identity.

32:33.209 --> 32:35.666
Well, I-I justified
it like buying a table

32:35.667 --> 32:37.583
at a charity function.

32:37.584 --> 32:41.333
You know, but it was really my
financial restrictions that...

32:41.334 --> 32:43.875
She helps out several
members of her family.

32:43.876 --> 32:46.416
Yeah, it was that, that was the reason

32:46.417 --> 32:47.750
this process dragged on so long.

32:47.751 --> 32:49.791
I believe that had it not been for

32:49.792 --> 32:51.708
that series of smaller payments...

32:51.709 --> 32:53.666
But they were $5000 a piece.

32:53.667 --> 32:56.791
Yeah, but because of the extended time

32:56.792 --> 32:58.666
we were able to bond as women

32:58.667 --> 33:00.374
'give each other advice... '

33:00.375 --> 33:02.291
Ultimately, become friends.

33:02.292 --> 33:06.124
She just spoke at my
bookstore and a few weeks back

33:06.125 --> 33:10.458
I helped her set up the format
for her news show "talkBACK."

33:10.459 --> 33:12.082
(LAUGHING)

33:12.083 --> 33:14.249
- (INDISTINCT)
- I am fascinated.

33:14.250 --> 33:17.208
I mean, this could be a
bizarre memoir of friendship.

33:17.209 --> 33:19.958
'I mean, the irony of
you two potentially'

33:19.959 --> 33:22.791
writing a book together
after she extorted you

33:22.792 --> 33:26.499
for her bookstore, I mean, it's absurd.

33:26.500 --> 33:28.124
Why not a bookstore?

33:28.125 --> 33:33.374
- Why?
- Uh, it's simple. The kids.

33:33.375 --> 33:36.499

is beggin', screamin'

33:36.500 --> 33:38.583

33:38.584 --> 33:39.917
They don't have nothing.

33:39.918 --> 33:43.666
No hope, no jobs, no
school to teach them.

33:43.667 --> 33:46.291
My bookstore is knowledge.

33:46.292 --> 33:50.499
I've got to keep it open,
it's their university.

33:50.500 --> 33:52.166
I'm sorry.

33:52.167 --> 33:55.875
I just know I need to stay afloat...

33:55.876 --> 33:58.708
until they wake up and realize...

33:58.709 --> 34:02.458
they're hungry, so I
can feed them their freedom.

34:02.459 --> 34:09.025
So, yes, by any means necessary,
we do what we have to do.

34:10.083 --> 34:11.416
Hm.

34:11.417 --> 34:13.081
But, uh...

34:13.083 --> 34:15.625
we lookin' at this as a blessing now

34:15.626 --> 34:17.484
so it's all good.

34:18.833 --> 34:21.833
- Do you have enough?
- Plenty.

34:21.833 --> 34:23.708
So we sold it, is that it?

34:30.792 --> 34:32.166

You're the one that should
be getting locked up, not me!

34:41.250 --> 34:42.791
I'm a community leader, bitch!

34:42.792 --> 34:44.208
I almost let you get away with it

34:44.208 --> 34:46.166
but you got too damn greedy.

34:46.167 --> 34:51.625
Damn, I almost let myself
believe we were friends.

34:51.626 --> 34:55.416
Shit, I'm probably the
only friend you have.

34:55.417 --> 34:58.541
You killed the last one!

34:58.542 --> 35:01.499
You just-you just take it too
far. You just take it too far.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.833
