[Crow caws]

00:05.419 --> 00:08.529
<i>Frankie: Ah, summer.
There's nothing like it.</i>

00:08.552 --> 00:11.409
<i>And this was the best one we had in ages.</i>

00:11.529 --> 00:13.711
<i>Maybe it was 'cause we had nowhere to go.</i>

00:13.778 --> 00:16.094
<i>Maybe it was 'cause we had nothing to do.</i>

00:16.109 --> 00:20.339
<i>I don't know. It was just
a nice, relaxing summer.</i>

00:20.636 --> 00:23.954
<i>Boss Co. branched out into landscaping.</i>

00:27.552 --> 00:31.229
<i>Brick actually put down his
book and picked up a new hobby.</i>

00:39.492 --> 00:42.336
<i>Sue spent her summer getting
ready for her senior year...</i>

00:42.456 --> 00:46.287
<i>- [pencil sharpener whirs]
- A year she dubbed "The Year of Sue."</i>

00:46.911 --> 00:49.580
[Pencil sharpener whirs]

00:49.647 --> 00:51.014
[Exhales forcefully]

00:51.082 --> 00:51.949
[Air hisses]

00:51.977 --> 00:54.985
<i>Mike WD-40'd everything in the house.</i>

00:59.936 --> 01:03.046
<i>And I finally got around
to flipping our mattress.</i>

01:06.009 --> 01:09.767
<i>Yep. After all these years,
we finally got it down.</i>

01:09.834 --> 01:12.127
<i>It was summer the way it was meant to be...</i>

01:12.247 --> 01:13.670
<i>nice and lazy.</i>

01:13.738 --> 01:16.382
<i>It felt like the longest summer ever.</i>

01:16.409 --> 01:17.315
[Branches rustle]

01:17.342 --> 01:19.843
I thought I heard something
going on back here.

01:19.911 --> 01:22.354
What are you guys doing in the
pool in the middle of the day?

01:22.372 --> 01:25.226
Oh, you know, just enjoying
the last Friday of summer

01:25.244 --> 01:26.818
before school starts.

01:27.083 --> 01:29.955
Frankie, school started on Monday.

01:30.001 --> 01:31.482
- What?! What?!
- Axl: Classic.

01:31.492 --> 01:33.586
Wait, how could this happen?

01:33.625 --> 01:35.259
Why didn't anybody tell us?!

01:35.326 --> 01:37.574
It was posted right on the school website.

01:37.610 --> 01:40.811
Oh, my God, mom. You
didn't check the website?!

01:40.830 --> 01:43.052
Oh, my God. Why didn't
you check the website?!

01:43.098 --> 01:45.873
- I can never remember my password!
- Aah!

01:45.993 --> 01:48.019
This was supposed to be The Year of Sue.

01:48.022 --> 01:49.677
[Breathing heavily] I'm missing everything.

01:49.696 --> 01:52.176
I missed my first last
Monday of my senior year.

01:52.243 --> 01:54.351
I missed my first last
Tuesday of my senior year.

01:54.379 --> 01:56.262
- I missed my first...
- We know how a calendar works, Sue.

01:56.289 --> 01:58.517
- Apparently, we don't.
- I would just like to point out

01:58.536 --> 02:00.501
I didn't get to miss a week
of school my senior year.

02:00.502 --> 02:02.661
You people owe me a full
week of leisure time.

02:02.687 --> 02:05.164
Brick: What about me?! It's
hard enough being the weird kid.

02:05.183 --> 02:07.478
Try being the weird kid
who shows up a week late.

02:07.598 --> 02:09.088
[Gurgling] Week late.

02:09.115 --> 02:11.670
All right. Listen. We can
still make part of the day.

02:11.696 --> 02:13.975
Come on. Come on, people.
Axl, get out of the way.

02:13.998 --> 02:16.834
Ugh! Dad WD-40'd the ladder!

02:19.237 --> 02:20.504
Hey.

02:20.899 --> 02:22.829
Take another shot at the old man

02:22.874 --> 02:24.126
before you head back to school?

02:24.153 --> 02:26.739
- Your school didn't start already, did it?
- No, but yours did,

02:26.778 --> 02:28.422
'cause you just got into the school of Axl

02:28.542 --> 02:30.228
where you'll be majoring
in getting your butt kicked

02:30.348 --> 02:32.482
with a minor in humiliation.

02:33.617 --> 02:34.918
Uh-oh!

02:34.986 --> 02:36.343
- [Chuckles]
- [Ball bouncing]

02:36.463 --> 02:38.455
Little late in the summer
for a block party, isn't it?

02:38.523 --> 02:40.056
- [Chuckles]
- Go.

02:40.083 --> 02:41.400
<i>Mike wasn't the kind of dad</i>

02:41.419 --> 02:43.575
<i>who'd let his kids win at anything.</i>

02:43.596 --> 02:45.425
- [Ball clattering]
- Mike: 7-0.

02:45.818 --> 02:47.583
That's called a skunk, my friend.

02:48.169 --> 02:50.602
Hey, dummy, I win. See?

02:50.635 --> 02:52.002
Right here.

02:54.773 --> 02:57.837
<i>Which is why it was so strange when...</i>

02:57.957 --> 02:59.958
[Ball bouncing]

02:59.959 --> 03:01.349
Oh, my God.

03:01.469 --> 03:03.928
I did it. I beat my dad.

03:03.956 --> 03:06.407
I just beat my dad in basketball!

03:06.527 --> 03:08.771
- [Laughs]
- You won one game.

03:08.891 --> 03:10.363
Put a monkey in front of a typewriter,

03:10.388 --> 03:11.536
he'll eventually type a sentence.

03:11.542 --> 03:13.893
Well, the sentence that monkey typed was

03:13.925 --> 03:17.049
[inhales deeply] "I beat
my dad at basketball!"

03:17.095 --> 03:18.878
- [Laughs]
- Keep your pants on.

03:18.906 --> 03:21.546
- Let's go again.
- All right. I'll play you again.

03:21.567 --> 03:22.884
But I want you to know if...

03:22.893 --> 03:25.289
<i>or should I say when I beat you again,</i>

03:25.303 --> 03:26.945
I will be the perfect gentleman.

03:26.972 --> 03:30.140
I'm the king of the world!

03:30.208 --> 03:32.908
Whoo!

03:33.740 --> 03:35.913
[Keyboard clacking] "Frankie1234."

03:35.980 --> 03:37.414
[Sighs]

03:37.482 --> 03:39.383
"Colinfirth."

03:39.450 --> 03:40.751
Hmm. [Clicks tongue]

03:40.818 --> 03:43.153
"Mrs. Frankiefirth?"

03:43.221 --> 03:45.283
Yes! I should write that down.

03:45.320 --> 03:47.195
- Eh. Nah, I'll remember.
- [Sighs]

03:47.232 --> 03:49.126
That was the longest day of my life.

03:49.193 --> 03:52.510
Which is ironic, seeing as I
was only there for 47 minutes.

03:52.630 --> 03:54.283
Oh, no. What happened?

03:54.403 --> 03:56.717
Well, because I missed the
first four days of school,

03:56.735 --> 03:58.217
I have no idea what we're studying,

03:58.226 --> 03:59.845
and neither do the
assorted ne'er-do-wells

03:59.845 --> 04:01.162
who share the back row with me.

04:01.282 --> 04:02.790
My options for gym shorts

04:02.799 --> 04:05.722
were either adult large
or a youth extra-small.

04:05.842 --> 04:07.910
Oh, and I have to play
Hitler in the school play.

04:07.978 --> 04:10.555
Listen, Brick, I know you
didn't get off to the best start,

04:10.580 --> 04:13.015
but you should take a
lesson from your sister.

04:13.083 --> 04:14.698
When things are the toughest,

04:14.735 --> 04:16.380
that's when you got to stay positive.

04:16.386 --> 04:20.089
[Groans loudly] The Year of Sue is ruined!

04:20.607 --> 04:22.820
I missed everything.

04:22.826 --> 04:24.750
I missed all the sign-ups
for all the committees.

04:24.786 --> 04:26.250
I missed the senior panoramic picture.

04:26.277 --> 04:27.649
I missed the candlelight ceremony

04:27.686 --> 04:29.360
where the seniors light
the candles for the juniors.

04:29.387 --> 04:31.728
I missed the senior pep rally
and the senior spirit rally,

04:31.728 --> 04:33.814
and I know those sound like the
same thing, but they are not.

04:33.850 --> 04:36.137
Honey, I know it's not an ideal situation.

04:36.174 --> 04:37.701
Oh, no. And you haven't
even heard the worst of it.

04:37.821 --> 04:39.879
- I haven't?
- Christine Feltkelner,

04:39.910 --> 04:42.745
the only other person in
the senior class with braces,

04:42.865 --> 04:44.766
got her braces off over the summer,

04:44.802 --> 04:47.702
which makes me the only
senior in the whole school

04:47.747 --> 04:49.714
who still has braces.

04:49.732 --> 04:51.703
And don't tell me if I am the only one,

04:51.712 --> 04:53.075
that is what makes me special.

04:53.112 --> 04:55.298
That worked with the Terry-cloth
pants grandma made me,

04:55.334 --> 04:57.100
but not with this.

04:57.466 --> 05:00.833
Sue, I know it seems like
you're never gonna get them off,

05:00.850 --> 05:02.213
and I don't get it, either.

05:02.240 --> 05:03.821
They look perfect to me.

05:03.889 --> 05:07.088
But you just have to hang
in there. You're so close.

05:07.208 --> 05:09.675
Am I? Am I?

05:10.015 --> 05:11.762
Because every time I go to Dr. Niller,

05:11.780 --> 05:13.012
he says, "three more months."

05:13.132 --> 05:16.100
I go in March, and he
says, "three more months."

05:16.168 --> 05:18.356
I go in June, and he
says, "three more months."

05:18.393 --> 05:21.759
I go in September, and he
says, "three more months."

05:21.774 --> 05:23.515
See? Look, I circled it on the calendar.

05:23.542 --> 05:25.271
While you were circling
things on the calendar,

05:25.289 --> 05:27.466
maybe you could have circled
the first day of school.

05:32.963 --> 05:35.533
- [Objects rattling]
- Axl: [Muffled] Brick!

05:35.653 --> 05:38.149
I got one week off between
football and classes.

05:38.168 --> 05:39.631
I'm trying to get some sleep.

05:39.751 --> 05:41.396
You own three shirts.

05:41.433 --> 05:43.518
Pick one and hit the road.

05:43.562 --> 05:45.244
Sorry. It's just

05:45.364 --> 05:47.543
seventh grade is a little more
challenging than I thought it'd be.

05:47.552 --> 05:49.253
Oh, my God. I don't care.

05:49.292 --> 05:51.183
Why are you trying to get close to me?

05:51.201 --> 05:53.021
I'm gone, man. Move on!

05:53.341 --> 05:55.719
My classmates are definitely
getting more mature.

05:55.747 --> 05:57.466
Boys are sitting with girls now.

05:57.512 --> 05:59.515
There's a kid in the
locker room with a beard.

06:00.256 --> 06:02.852
If I don't act, I could get left behind,

06:02.972 --> 06:05.660
so I dug deep and really
did some soul searching,

06:05.679 --> 06:07.342
and I figured out what my problem is.

06:07.654 --> 06:09.163
I need a new backpack.

06:09.283 --> 06:10.462
Uh-huh.

06:10.582 --> 06:12.987
I'm using my "Shaq-will" O'Neal one,

06:13.023 --> 06:14.459
and according to a guy on a sports team,

06:14.505 --> 06:17.340
he's not even playing
anymore. So I'm changing it up.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.334
It's a whole new Brick this year.

06:19.343 --> 06:21.081
And the new Brick carries...

06:21.575 --> 06:22.901
A messenger bag.

06:22.920 --> 06:25.142
Here's your first message... no one cares.

06:25.215 --> 06:27.228
Oh-ho, I think they will.

06:27.348 --> 06:29.167
See, the beauty of a messenger bag

06:29.213 --> 06:30.713
is you can adjust it to your mood.

06:30.833 --> 06:34.619
Left, right, over the
shoulder, over the chest.

06:35.131 --> 06:36.229
Hmm.

06:36.485 --> 06:39.768
Maybe with just a slight adjustment.

06:42.822 --> 06:45.136
I think this is how they're
wearing it these days.

06:52.573 --> 06:54.932
Dr. Niller: There's my star patient.

06:55.037 --> 06:56.652
How you doing, Sue?

06:56.672 --> 06:57.813
Pretty good, except...

06:57.832 --> 07:00.823
And there's mom. How's mom doing?

07:00.943 --> 07:02.771
- Well...
- Okay. Let's take a look.

07:02.780 --> 07:04.316
Open for me.

07:04.701 --> 07:06.694
Uh-huh. Looks very good.

07:06.713 --> 07:08.661
- Uh-huh.
- No, I mean it.

07:08.688 --> 07:12.153
This is exactly what I've
been hoping to see today.

07:12.365 --> 07:14.487
The incisors are finally
in the right place,

07:14.524 --> 07:17.093
the premolars are rotated beautifully.

07:17.213 --> 07:19.727
[Muffled] Well, I have been
wearing my rubber bands.

07:19.764 --> 07:21.428
I've got to tell you, Sue,

07:21.693 --> 07:24.575
this is precisely what
we've been waiting for.

07:24.876 --> 07:27.236
There's only one thing left to say.

07:27.264 --> 07:29.724
- [Squealing]
- I'll see you in three months.

07:29.844 --> 07:31.672
[Screeches]

07:32.135 --> 07:33.645
No.

07:34.084 --> 07:35.791
- No?
- No.

07:35.821 --> 07:36.672
No more months.

07:36.681 --> 07:38.904
You know, I've been on your
side, but enough is enough.

07:38.922 --> 07:41.204
Look at her. Look at this bite.

07:41.272 --> 07:43.806
What is wrong with this
bite, Dr. Niller? Hmm?

07:43.833 --> 07:45.123
These teeth are perfect!

07:45.142 --> 07:47.189
They may look good to the naked eye,

07:47.208 --> 07:50.949
- but with a few more tweaks...
- No. No more tweaks.

07:51.069 --> 07:53.254
It's been eight years, for God's sakes.

07:53.374 --> 07:54.845
There comes a time when you have to say,

07:54.882 --> 07:56.748
"the cake is done," and
take it out of the oven.

07:56.787 --> 07:58.065
I know you're frustrated,

07:58.101 --> 08:00.077
but the bone is just a little spongy.

08:00.086 --> 08:01.467
Spongy bone.

08:01.587 --> 08:04.165
I'll tell you what's
spongy... your bank account,

08:04.174 --> 08:06.058
'cause it's sucking up all our money.

08:06.068 --> 08:08.254
And don't think we don't know
about the lake house you bought,

08:08.263 --> 08:09.452
'cause it was in the paper.

08:09.572 --> 08:12.034
Maybe next time, you don't
brag about it on the front page.

08:12.078 --> 08:13.889
I know this is an emotional time,

08:13.923 --> 08:15.591
but, Sue, you're a very difficult case.

08:15.627 --> 08:18.708
Your premolars were literally
facing the wrong direction.

08:18.728 --> 08:21.856
She had a tooth growing out
of the roof of her mouth!

08:21.875 --> 08:24.833
She's in a book of dental abnormalities!

08:24.900 --> 08:26.686
You know what book she should be in?

08:26.702 --> 08:28.818
The Guinness book, because
she's had braces longer

08:28.838 --> 08:31.159
than any human being in history.

08:31.443 --> 08:34.520
Let us go, Dr. Niller.
Your work here is done.

08:34.538 --> 08:37.025
And I know because I went
to six and a half months

08:37.054 --> 08:38.573
of dental-assistant school,

08:38.609 --> 08:41.115
give or take a few absences,
but they were excused.

08:41.673 --> 08:43.035
This is The Year of Sue,

08:43.063 --> 08:44.627
and it's not starting in three months.

08:44.655 --> 08:46.365
It's starting now.

08:47.727 --> 08:51.157
Sue Heck needs a win.

08:53.526 --> 08:56.060
I don't know how messengers do it.

08:57.358 --> 08:58.347
[Whistles]

08:58.917 --> 09:00.792
- Okay.
- Hey.

09:01.350 --> 09:03.771
- Hey. Where were you guys?
- Orthodontist.

09:03.839 --> 09:05.368
Mike: Yeah? How did it go?

09:05.679 --> 09:07.342
[Humming]

09:07.409 --> 09:10.471
[Squealing]

09:16.024 --> 09:17.652
- Whoo-hoo!
- Mike: Look at that!

09:17.670 --> 09:19.168
Doesn't she look great?

09:19.178 --> 09:20.650
- Hey, hey!
- Wow!

09:20.678 --> 09:23.787
- Oh, my God. Wow!
- Guys, you're staring at me.

09:23.814 --> 09:26.238
Sorry, but the last time
I saw you without braces,

09:26.275 --> 09:28.736
you were 9 years old.
You're just so beautiful.

09:28.856 --> 09:32.505
Oh, dad. [Chuckles] I'm
just the same old Sue.

09:32.532 --> 09:36.374
I'm trying to think of
an insult, and I-I can't.

09:36.401 --> 09:38.203
Okay. Throw out whatever
you got for dinner,

09:38.240 --> 09:40.819
'cause we are having a
special meal to celebrate.

09:40.852 --> 09:42.657
We got whatever Sue wanted...

09:42.675 --> 09:45.657
Taffy, caramel, caramel
apples, jelly beans.

09:45.693 --> 09:47.743
Oh, kettle corn, candy corn,

09:47.759 --> 09:50.295
and last but not least
[Singsong voice] bit-o-honey.

09:50.332 --> 09:52.664
And remember, you got to have some greens,

09:52.784 --> 09:54.598
so everybody take a jolly rancher.

09:54.666 --> 09:55.666
[Laughs]

09:55.734 --> 09:57.667
Did they let you keep the braces?

09:59.414 --> 10:01.335
What? It's a legitimate question.

10:01.840 --> 10:02.873
Sue,

10:02.941 --> 10:04.664
why don't you tell everybody
what you told me in the car?

10:04.701 --> 10:07.426
[Normal voice] Mm! Well,
before I got my braces off,

10:07.546 --> 10:10.517
I would have never had the
nerve to run for this office.

10:10.637 --> 10:12.548
Holy crap! Kettle corn is amazing!

10:12.548 --> 10:15.474
But I really feel like
things are going my way,

10:15.493 --> 10:19.352
and since The Year of Sue is back on track,

10:19.472 --> 10:23.157
I have decided to run for...

10:23.277 --> 10:24.959
Sergeant at arms!

10:24.977 --> 10:27.191
More like sergeant of pretty teeth!

10:27.311 --> 10:28.828
It can't be done!

10:34.456 --> 10:36.647
Isn't this great? It fits everything...

10:36.651 --> 10:38.215
my books, my gym clothes,

10:38.224 --> 10:39.788
some candy from last night's dinner,

10:39.814 --> 10:42.175
a hairdryer in case
someone gives me a swirly.

10:42.193 --> 10:43.149
[Sighs]

10:43.422 --> 10:45.251
So, what do you think, mom? Did I nail it?

10:45.371 --> 10:47.800
- Yeah, it's fine.
- Yep.

10:48.222 --> 10:50.607
It's the perfect bag for me.

10:56.168 --> 10:58.044
[Squealing]

10:58.291 --> 11:01.682
Hey! Come on! Let's go!

11:02.105 --> 11:05.754
[Singsong voice] I got
to get this to school!

11:06.531 --> 11:08.104
<i>Sue knew when she got to school</i>

11:08.141 --> 11:10.610
<i>everyone would notice
she got her braces off,</i>

11:10.619 --> 11:12.622
<i>but just in case they didn't...</i>

11:12.631 --> 11:14.561
I got my braces off! [Chuckles]

11:14.598 --> 11:16.454
Hey, I just got my braces off.

11:16.472 --> 11:17.826
I got my braces off.

11:17.835 --> 11:19.829
Soak it in, people. She's gorgeous!

11:19.866 --> 11:22.463
[Laughs]

11:23.358 --> 11:24.987
- [TV chatter]
- Let's go.

11:25.107 --> 11:26.479
You sure you want to do this?

11:26.488 --> 11:27.658
I already beat you three times.

11:27.695 --> 11:29.497
Yeah, and I beat you 300 times.

11:29.617 --> 11:30.383
[Sighs] Off the couch.

11:30.402 --> 11:32.294
Look [Scoffs] don't
take this the wrong way,

11:32.295 --> 11:33.621
but it's not that fun anymore.

11:33.741 --> 11:35.249
Sports aren't about fun.

11:35.369 --> 11:37.014
They're about having a clear winner.

11:37.305 --> 11:38.944
- [TV shuts off]
- Let's go.

11:39.785 --> 11:41.075
[Grunts]

11:41.143 --> 11:42.710
[Groans]

11:42.778 --> 11:44.879
- You all right?
- Yeah. Fine.

11:44.946 --> 11:46.151
Do you want to stop?

11:46.181 --> 11:47.267
Why would I want to stop?

11:47.294 --> 11:49.160
'Cause you just made a noise
like you were having a baby.

11:49.184 --> 11:49.855
What are we doing here?

11:49.874 --> 11:51.639
Are we tracking each other's
noises or are we playing basketball?

11:51.666 --> 11:53.669
Dad, if you want to stop, I'll
just tell people you beat me.

11:53.688 --> 11:55.278
That's what you're gonna have to tell them,

11:55.279 --> 11:57.079
'cause I'm gonna beat you.

12:02.221 --> 12:03.484
Damn it.

12:03.502 --> 12:04.910
[Objects rattling]

12:05.605 --> 12:08.029
Brick! Will you please go to bed?

12:08.057 --> 12:10.060
I have to be up by noon tomorrow.

12:10.700 --> 12:13.169
What do you think? Mom carried me in this.

12:13.196 --> 12:15.528
Well, actually, it was
the Fergusons' baby, but...

12:15.931 --> 12:17.916
I can access my snacks
through the leg holes.

12:19.031 --> 12:20.934
I thought you were using the guitar case.

12:21.199 --> 12:24.072
Actually, there was a slight
snag with the guitar case.

12:30.474 --> 12:32.642
[Yawning] Hey, Brick.

12:32.660 --> 12:34.343
[Clears throat]

12:34.596 --> 12:36.263
I think I broke dad today.

12:36.720 --> 12:39.181
Have you noticed he's been, like,
slowing down a little lately?

12:39.217 --> 12:41.257
Hmm. I don't know.

12:41.605 --> 12:42.812
I mean,

12:43.187 --> 12:45.903
he does seem to moan
more when he sits down.

12:46.023 --> 12:47.686
And last week, he increased my allowance

12:47.714 --> 12:48.903
so I would tie his shoes.

12:49.023 --> 12:49.726
[Inhales sharply]

12:49.735 --> 12:51.619
I beat him for the first time
in basketball the other day,

12:51.638 --> 12:53.622
and, uh, it felt so good.

12:53.664 --> 12:55.579
But then I beat him two more times,

12:55.607 --> 12:57.446
and it didn't feel as good.

12:57.566 --> 12:58.855
Do you think that's weird?

12:59.239 --> 13:01.114
I know you don't pay
that much attention to me,

13:01.123 --> 13:02.742
but I'm not really a sports person.

13:02.769 --> 13:05.605
[Scoffs] It's not just
a sports thing, Brick.

13:05.641 --> 13:07.397
I-I'm not supposed to
beat dad at anything.

13:07.425 --> 13:08.916
Why?

13:09.245 --> 13:10.581
'Cause dad's dad.

13:10.626 --> 13:13.974
He's like, you know,
all powerful and stuff.

13:14.094 --> 13:15.456
So why don't you just let him win?

13:15.576 --> 13:16.645
Well, 'cause if I let him win,

13:16.654 --> 13:17.889
he'll think I feel sorry for him,

13:17.889 --> 13:19.078
and he'll feel even worse.

13:19.265 --> 13:21.361
If I'm gonna play him,
I got to try my hardest,

13:21.390 --> 13:23.773
and if I try my hardest,
I will beat him. See,

13:24.101 --> 13:26.196
this is where my
awesomeness works against me.

13:26.804 --> 13:28.152
I wouldn't worry about it too much.

13:28.163 --> 13:29.492
It's the natural order of things.

13:29.978 --> 13:31.374
What do you mean?

13:31.442 --> 13:33.619
[Sighs] Adults are supposed to slow down.

13:33.677 --> 13:35.445
We were put here on earth to replace them.

13:35.512 --> 13:38.247
You replace dad, Sue replaces mom,

13:38.315 --> 13:40.906
and since I was a mistake,
I don't replace anybody.

13:41.185 --> 13:43.354
I'm free to live my life as I choose.

13:47.691 --> 13:50.395
<i>So, the night of Sue's last
first day without braces...</i>

13:50.515 --> 13:52.848
I mean her second last first day...

13:52.883 --> 13:53.825
I can't keep it straight.

13:53.872 --> 13:56.442
<i>But things couldn't have been going better.</i>

13:57.735 --> 14:00.636
Well, I guess they could have
been going a little better.

14:02.050 --> 14:04.151
[Muffled] Mom, can I have a word with you?

14:04.181 --> 14:05.656
Little hectic right now, Sue. Can it wait?

14:05.703 --> 14:07.161
No, I think we should talk right now.

14:07.219 --> 14:09.174
[Sighs] Okay. What is it?

14:09.479 --> 14:10.374
[Gasps]

14:10.409 --> 14:11.925
Oh, my God.

14:12.985 --> 14:14.144
What happened?!

14:14.208 --> 14:15.859
I don't know. I don't know.

14:15.871 --> 14:17.322
Things are shifting, mom.

14:17.352 --> 14:19.657
It started with one
tooth, and now it's two.

14:19.693 --> 14:20.974
Dr. Niller was right.

14:20.974 --> 14:22.695
I wasn't ready to get my braces off.

14:22.724 --> 14:24.925
I do have spongy bones!

14:25.102 --> 14:26.874
- What am I gonna do?
- Okay. All right. Give me a second.

14:26.880 --> 14:27.682
I got to think.

14:27.741 --> 14:29.272
I can't go to school like this.

14:29.340 --> 14:29.971
I can't!

14:30.007 --> 14:31.956
Calm down, Sue. It's not that bad.

14:31.968 --> 14:33.654
What's not that bad? Whoa!

14:33.654 --> 14:34.555
Can you tell?

14:34.608 --> 14:36.423
You got three teeth
going all over the place.

14:36.464 --> 14:37.166
Three?!

14:37.172 --> 14:38.255
Frankie, what the hell is going on?

14:38.279 --> 14:40.597
Why did Niller take them off
if he knew she wasn't ready?

14:40.651 --> 14:41.832
Wh... he recommended this?!

14:41.952 --> 14:43.079
Recommended-ish.

14:43.120 --> 14:43.857
This is nuts!

14:43.869 --> 14:45.848
The guy's building a
lake house with our money,

14:45.859 --> 14:47.065
and our daughter ends up like this?

14:47.091 --> 14:48.024
I'm going down there.

14:48.092 --> 14:49.143
- You can't.
- Why can't I?

14:49.193 --> 14:50.326
Mom forced him to take them off!

14:50.394 --> 14:51.168
What?!

14:51.209 --> 14:52.344
Forced-ish.

14:52.385 --> 14:54.124
Dr. Niller said that my bones are spongy

14:54.159 --> 14:55.716
so I was gonna have to
wait another three months,

14:55.727 --> 14:57.794
and then mom yelled at him,
so he took them off anyway.

14:57.834 --> 15:00.234
Well, I was trying to
get you your Year of Sue.

15:00.275 --> 15:01.580
Oh, sure, everybody wants their year,

15:01.598 --> 15:03.079
but nobody wants to get their hands dirty.

15:03.102 --> 15:03.910
Could you guys keep it down?

15:03.934 --> 15:05.567
I'm not getting up for another six hours.

15:05.608 --> 15:06.375
Whoa.

15:06.495 --> 15:07.511
What's happening to your mouth?

15:07.522 --> 15:09.308
You got, like, four teeth
going all over the place.

15:09.428 --> 15:10.811
Four?!

15:12.460 --> 15:14.275
Oh, my God. This is a nightmare.

15:14.298 --> 15:16.569
I can just kiss sergeant at arms goodbye.

15:16.604 --> 15:17.564
Not with that mouth you can't.

15:17.570 --> 15:19.261
Boo-yah! I'm back, baby.

15:19.261 --> 15:20.672
- Whoo!
- I just don't get it.

15:20.731 --> 15:23.276
This was supposed to be The Year of Sue!

15:23.335 --> 15:26.022
You know what, Sue? Maybe
stop labeling things.

15:26.063 --> 15:28.352
Maybe just see what happens,
and then give it a name.

15:28.472 --> 15:30.485
Nice parenting, mom.
How did this even happen?

15:30.495 --> 15:31.818
I thought you went to dental school.

15:31.824 --> 15:33.154
I only went for six months,

15:33.181 --> 15:34.580
and I missed a lot of days, all right?

15:34.610 --> 15:35.195
Okay, people.

15:35.236 --> 15:37.396
I really need help figuring
out this backpack situation.

15:37.442 --> 15:39.860
Not now, Brick. We're focusing
all our attention on Sue.

15:39.914 --> 15:40.766
Why?

15:41.200 --> 15:42.288
Whoa.

15:42.329 --> 15:44.951
I hope he's not gonna charge
us to do the whole thing again.

15:45.019 --> 15:47.095
It's gonna put us in the
poor house. Look at her.

15:47.215 --> 15:49.331
It's like a demolition
derby going on in there.

15:49.451 --> 15:51.292
She's gonna have braces
on for six more years.

15:51.333 --> 15:52.848
- She'll have them on at her wedding.
- What?!

15:52.860 --> 15:54.429
Why are we still throwing money at this?

15:54.470 --> 15:57.068
Just move her to a bell tower
in Paris and call it a day.

15:57.080 --> 15:58.508
- [Air hisses]
- Hello?

15:58.526 --> 15:59.926
No one's concentrating on me.

15:59.967 --> 16:01.325
I need help here.

16:01.389 --> 16:03.216
Seventh grade is a very formative year.

16:03.336 --> 16:04.697
Yesterday, I was offered something

16:04.767 --> 16:05.715
by a guy called a stoner.

16:05.715 --> 16:07.196
Nobody cares about your
stupid backpack, Brick!

16:07.249 --> 16:09.708
This is your fault, mom.
You gave me bad advice.

16:09.743 --> 16:11.493
You said the guitar case was fine.

16:11.663 --> 16:13.067
How long have you been my kid, Brick?

16:13.103 --> 16:15.795
You should know when I say
"fine" I'm not paying attention.

16:16.282 --> 16:17.921
Sue: Darrin's coming back tomorrow,

16:17.968 --> 16:19.449
and I didn't even get to kiss him

16:19.478 --> 16:20.490
with my straight teeth.

16:20.508 --> 16:22.252
Sue, everything's gonna be fine,

16:22.317 --> 16:24.020
and not the "I'm not listening" fine,

16:24.067 --> 16:25.454
the "we'll figure it out" fine.

16:25.478 --> 16:27.240
Oh, I can't believe we're
still talking about this!

16:27.251 --> 16:29.130
God clearly wants her to be ugly.

16:29.171 --> 16:30.330
Why are we fighting his plan?

16:30.354 --> 16:31.279
- Mike.
- Axl.

16:31.296 --> 16:33.532
No. You know what? Axl's right.

16:33.603 --> 16:36.272
Clearly, the universe is
trying to tell me something.

16:36.459 --> 16:39.403
Whenever I try to do
anything, it gets undone.

16:39.608 --> 16:42.898
And I know I always bounce
back, but maybe I shouldn't.

16:43.018 --> 16:46.803
Maybe the universe is sending
me a message to give up!

16:46.923 --> 16:49.841
Well, message received, universe!

16:50.143 --> 16:51.445
Got it!

16:53.290 --> 16:54.993
- [Sighs]
- [Door slams]

16:55.057 --> 16:56.000
Okay, she's fine.

16:56.006 --> 16:57.972
Now, about my backpack situation.

17:04.163 --> 17:05.422
Sneaking out on me?

17:07.769 --> 17:09.086
Let's go. One more game.

17:09.479 --> 17:10.690
I really can't.

17:10.810 --> 17:12.903
What's wrong? You afraid of me?

17:13.792 --> 17:16.527
[Grunts]

17:18.300 --> 17:19.471
Bill: Hey, guys!

17:19.500 --> 17:20.348
Hi, Bill.

17:20.407 --> 17:21.691
Hey, I was cleaning out my garage today

17:21.702 --> 17:23.517
and realized I never
returned your ball pump.

17:23.798 --> 17:25.449
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

17:25.501 --> 17:26.941
Hey, this is my nephew, A.J.

17:26.959 --> 17:28.492
He's up visiting us for a few days.

17:28.550 --> 17:30.150
Hey, A.J. here's my son Axl.

17:30.190 --> 17:31.783
Looks like you guys are playing some hoops!

17:31.903 --> 17:34.426
How about a little, uh, two on two?

17:34.546 --> 17:37.328
Oh, well, I was just
about to kick Axl's butt,

17:37.332 --> 17:38.953
but I guess that can wait.

17:39.340 --> 17:41.043
[Grunts]

17:46.394 --> 17:47.869
Nice shot, dad!

17:47.989 --> 17:49.982
[Panting] All right.

17:52.769 --> 17:54.589
Ooh. Hey!

17:55.833 --> 17:57.067
Ah!

17:57.135 --> 17:58.850
- [Clapping]
- That's two for the good guys.

17:58.874 --> 18:00.689
<i>Yep, they may be here to replace us,</i>

18:00.888 --> 18:02.172
<i>but until they do,</i>

18:02.240 --> 18:05.805
<i>we might as well hitch our old,
rusty wagons to their stars.</i>

18:06.150 --> 18:07.345
Good shot, Axl!

18:08.515 --> 18:09.914
Go get it, Axl!

18:12.315 --> 18:14.340
Hey! Nice job!

18:14.519 --> 18:15.919
[Grunts]

18:17.477 --> 18:19.075
- Yes!
- Oh-ho!

18:19.111 --> 18:20.580
Attaboy, Axl.

18:20.621 --> 18:21.276
Hey.

18:21.396 --> 18:22.523
That's the ballgame.

18:22.552 --> 18:23.727
Whew!

18:24.303 --> 18:26.029
You guys want to play again, or...

18:26.487 --> 18:27.903
Do you not have three minutes?

18:27.939 --> 18:29.233
[Laughter]

18:29.882 --> 18:31.298
[Panting] You guys were good today.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.353
I think we're gonna go
home and lick our wounds.

18:33.874 --> 18:34.771
Later.

18:35.705 --> 18:37.918
Ooh. That was awesome.

18:38.038 --> 18:39.996
We totally destroyed those guys.

18:40.310 --> 18:42.607
Is it just me, or has Bill lost a step?

18:42.642 --> 18:44.813
Oh, no, he's quick. You're quicker.

18:45.182 --> 18:47.172
I think you might have broken
his ankle on that crossover.

18:47.292 --> 18:48.536
[Chuckles]

18:48.785 --> 18:50.801
Hey, you must have picked
his pocket like three times.

18:50.842 --> 18:51.919
Yeah, I guess.

18:52.323 --> 18:53.493
You know,

18:53.821 --> 18:55.226
the key to that move is,

18:55.618 --> 18:58.100
- you got to shade 'em to the right.
- Oh.

18:58.511 --> 18:59.845
Yeah. Did you notice that?

18:59.869 --> 19:01.578
Yeah, no, you got to
teach me that sometime.

19:01.608 --> 19:02.509
All right.

19:02.866 --> 19:04.751
Sue, heard we had a little problem.

19:05.225 --> 19:08.731
There may have been some slight shifting.

19:08.761 --> 19:10.370
I'm sure it's not that bad.

19:10.558 --> 19:12.383
Let's take a little look, here.

19:13.689 --> 19:14.731
Whoa.

19:15.837 --> 19:18.670
Sue, I want you to know that
this is not a victory for me.

19:19.202 --> 19:20.843
Despite what my
mother-in-law says,

19:20.847 --> 19:22.363
I don't enjoy being right.

19:22.533 --> 19:24.932
But you don't become
the best ortho in Orson

19:24.938 --> 19:27.566
without knowing your way
around a set of chompers.

19:28.023 --> 19:30.467
So, let's see what we can do here.

19:31.265 --> 19:33.818
- You know what?
- I know, I know.

19:33.938 --> 19:35.972
I have to get my braces back on.

19:36.040 --> 19:38.742
Just go ahead and do it. I deserve it.

19:38.809 --> 19:41.019
Actually, what I was going to say was

19:41.045 --> 19:43.406
I think I might be able
to take care of this

19:43.526 --> 19:46.287
without putting braces back on at all.

19:47.485 --> 19:49.927
Really?!

19:50.047 --> 19:51.674
Let me ask you something.

19:52.396 --> 19:54.509
Instead of getting braces again,

19:54.829 --> 19:58.442
what would you say to
wearing a retainer for a year?

19:59.832 --> 20:03.326
A Year of Sue?

20:05.759 --> 20:09.390
<i>And a month later, Sue
did win sergeant at arms.</i>

20:09.829 --> 20:12.737
Please rise and face the flag.

20:14.237 --> 20:16.002
Remove all hats.

20:16.038 --> 20:18.005
[Clears throat]

20:18.609 --> 20:20.685
I pledge allegiance to the flag...

20:20.805 --> 20:23.410
<i>Maybe it was because
she got her braces off.</i>

20:23.530 --> 20:26.730
<i>Or maybe she really
was coming into her own.</i>

20:26.850 --> 20:28.890
<i>I guess we'll never know.</i>

20:28.958 --> 20:30.828
<i>But things were changing.</i>

20:30.948 --> 20:33.193
<i>Maybe it really was gonna be...</i>

20:33.196 --> 20:36.206
<i>- ... and justice for all.
- ... The Year of Sue.</i>

20:43.247 --> 20:45.835
Damn it, Sue. We try to
take you out to celebrate,

20:45.863 --> 20:47.363
we end up in a dumpster.

20:47.483 --> 20:50.225
Who the hell puts their
retainer in a napkin?

20:50.454 --> 20:53.198
I'm sorry! I said I'm sorry.

20:53.318 --> 20:55.667
You guys go. I'll... I'll find it myself.

20:55.686 --> 20:56.472
Good idea.

20:56.491 --> 20:58.713
Let's just close the lid and
let 'em take her to the dump.

20:58.741 --> 21:00.689
City's problem now.

21:01.037 --> 21:03.204
- Wiat a minute.
- Did you find it?

21:03.232 --> 21:06.616
No. But I think I found the answer
for all my backpacks problems.

21:08.518 --> 21:10.603
- What do you think?
- It's fine.

21:10.723 --> 21:13.457
- Found it! Phew!
- Whoo!

21:14.207 --> 21:16.182
Yep, not mine!

21:16.732 --> 21:18.515
Eww.
