00:15.306 --> 00:17.392
-Is that your husband?

00:17.892 --> 00:19.561
-Is he here? Is he at work?
-Mm-mm.

00:19.644 --> 00:20.895
When's he coming home?

00:20.979 --> 00:22.814
Soon. Any minute. Any minute.

00:23.565 --> 00:25.442
-Fuck. Fuck.

00:25.525 --> 00:26.651
Okay. All right, all right.

00:26.735 --> 00:29.571
Text him and tell him
you need something from the store.

00:32.032 --> 00:34.200
Wait. Hold up.
L… let me see what you write.

00:34.826 --> 00:35.952
Uh, uh…

00:36.536 --> 00:38.413
What are you waiting for?
Just text your husband.

00:38.496 --> 00:39.956
Oh my God. Okay.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.916
Can you stop by the store?

00:42.000 --> 00:43.752
What should I tell him that I need?

00:43.835 --> 00:46.212
Uh…
I don't know. I don't know.

00:46.755 --> 00:47.756
Bread. Bread.

00:57.891 --> 00:58.767
"This is weird"?

00:58.850 --> 01:00.727
-Why the fuck is this weird?
-Um…

01:00.810 --> 01:02.187
Why is this weird?

01:02.270 --> 01:03.354
Ooh.

01:04.064 --> 01:07.317
"I'm concerned about you"?
Why the fuck is he concerned about you?

01:07.400 --> 01:10.320
Because… because he knows
that I don't… I don't eat carbs.

01:10.403 --> 01:12.739
I'm on this diet, so I… I don't eat bread.

01:12.822 --> 01:14.783
Then why the fuck
did you say you wanted bread?

01:14.866 --> 01:16.868
-You said bread, and--
-Goddamn it.

01:17.660 --> 01:20.413
I can fix it. Okay.
Hold on, I can fix it. I can fix it.

01:24.709 --> 01:25.668
-Okay?
-Yeah.

01:31.424 --> 01:32.967
-Who is this fucking guy?
-Okay, okay.

01:33.051 --> 01:35.804
-Bread! It's fucking bread!
-Okay, okay. Here, here.

01:35.887 --> 01:36.846
-Goddamn it.
-Huh?

01:36.930 --> 01:38.681
Yeah, that's good. Send that.

01:47.816 --> 01:49.526
-Okay.

01:49.609 --> 01:51.528
Oh my God. Oh my God.

01:51.611 --> 01:54.405
-Are you gonna kill me?
-I want answers. Okay? Sit down.

01:56.032 --> 01:57.867
What do you got going on with her? Huh?

01:58.576 --> 02:00.620
-Lisa?
-Yeah. Are you working together?

02:00.703 --> 02:02.872
-Are you two trying to cut me out?
-Cut you out of what?

02:02.956 --> 02:04.874
I have no idea what you're talking about.

02:04.958 --> 02:08.002
No. You… you live right across the street,
and then you follow me on Instagram,

02:08.086 --> 02:09.212
like it's a coincidence?

02:09.295 --> 02:10.922
You're running some kind of game with her.

02:11.005 --> 02:12.257
I swear to God I'm not.

02:12.340 --> 02:13.716
Hold up. Is she here?

02:14.592 --> 02:15.677
Chastity!

02:15.760 --> 02:17.345
-Hey, Chastity!
-No.

02:17.846 --> 02:18.888
Chastity!

02:19.389 --> 02:20.390
Hey!

02:20.473 --> 02:23.852
-Who is Chastity?
-Lisa is Chastity. Chastity!

02:23.935 --> 02:25.854
What? Lisa is Chastity?

02:25.937 --> 02:28.189
Oh, Jesus Christ,
I feel like my head's gonna explode.

02:28.273 --> 02:30.775
Okay. Well,
whatever her name is, she's dead.

02:30.859 --> 02:32.652
Bullshit. I just talked to her.

02:32.735 --> 02:34.571
When? Tonight?

02:36.364 --> 02:39.409
Oh, what the fuck?
Did you call the cops on me?

02:39.492 --> 02:40.410
No.

02:42.745 --> 02:43.621
No, no, no, no.

02:44.205 --> 02:45.248
What is happening?

02:45.331 --> 02:46.958
Get away from the window.

02:53.631 --> 02:55.800
-You stay here.
-Okay.

02:55.884 --> 02:56.968
Holy shit.

02:57.051 --> 02:58.887
-You never saw me.
-No. Please.

02:58.970 --> 03:00.430
-You don't know anything about me.
-Okay.

03:04.100 --> 03:05.768
Okay. Okay.

03:08.521 --> 03:11.149
Hey,
if you say one word about me,

03:12.233 --> 03:13.359
I'll kill her.

03:16.654 --> 03:17.697
You can't kill her.

03:18.781 --> 03:20.033
She's already dead.

03:22.118 --> 03:26.289
There's nothing you can take from me
that I haven't already lost.

03:28.875 --> 03:30.627
I just want answers.

03:33.087 --> 03:34.547
That's all I want too.

03:49.687 --> 03:50.521
Detective Lane.

03:50.605 --> 03:53.107
Hi, Anna.
Would it be all right if we came inside?

03:53.983 --> 03:56.861
-Wha… what for?
-We just wanna talk to you for a second.

03:57.987 --> 03:59.948
Uh, sure. Sure.

04:10.583 --> 04:13.169
Actually,
I could sure use a cup of coffee.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.337
It's been a long day.

04:16.756 --> 04:18.925
A cup of coffee. Yes.

04:20.385 --> 04:21.261
Yes.

04:24.389 --> 04:25.640
A cup of coffee.

04:31.396 --> 04:33.273
So, uh…

04:33.356 --> 04:36.651
…what brings you over at this hour?

04:36.734 --> 04:38.278
It's about your neighbor, Mr. Coleman.

04:40.613 --> 04:42.407
He's a handsome devil, isn't he?

04:42.490 --> 04:46.452
I can see how someone might become
infatuated with a guy like that.

04:55.211 --> 04:56.379
Thanks.

04:56.963 --> 04:58.506
Could I trouble you for some sugar?

04:59.716 --> 05:00.550
Sugar. Yeah.

05:02.051 --> 05:03.845
It's in the pantry.

05:31.039 --> 05:33.541
Here you go. So, what about Neil?

05:33.624 --> 05:34.584
Officer Walters.

05:35.501 --> 05:38.087
Uh, Miss Whitaker, this is
a temporary restraining order

05:38.171 --> 05:39.505
filed by Neil Coleman

05:39.589 --> 05:42.550
for unlawful entry into his home
and harassment of his family.

05:45.011 --> 05:46.679
You're lucky he didn't press charges.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.016
I know. I… I don't know
what I was thinking.

05:50.099 --> 05:51.517
I… Well, I wasn't thinking.

05:53.853 --> 05:55.271
I shouldn't have done it.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.190
I'm glad to hear you say that, Anna.

05:57.273 --> 05:58.399
Is this chicken casserole?

06:01.235 --> 06:02.153
Um, yes.

06:02.236 --> 06:04.864
Would I be putting you out too much
to ask for a slice?

06:04.947 --> 06:06.574
I mean, it has been a long day.

06:10.828 --> 06:12.622
Uh, sure.

06:51.452 --> 06:52.578
You okay, Anna?

06:52.662 --> 06:53.538
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

06:54.539 --> 06:55.373
Yeah.

06:56.833 --> 07:01.671
<i> We've got a 10-52 in progress</i>
<i>at 622 South Lincoln.</i>

07:02.213 --> 07:05.425
Dispatch, this is Patrol 4.
We are on our way.

07:06.342 --> 07:08.845
Thanks anyway, ma'am.
Sorry to put you through the trouble.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.933
It smells delicious.

07:19.772 --> 07:21.691
Just stay out of their business. Okay?

07:39.834 --> 07:41.169
You can come out now.

07:51.220 --> 07:52.221
Thank you.

07:53.139 --> 07:54.807
I didn't do it to be nice.

07:57.185 --> 08:01.230
I'm just trying to figure out
if I'm… crazy or not.

08:05.026 --> 08:07.195
Let's see if you can help me
figure it out.

08:08.196 --> 08:12.033
So Lisa's real name is Chastity?

08:12.116 --> 08:13.075
That's what she told me,

08:13.159 --> 08:15.620
but I wouldn't be surprised
if that was a lie too.

08:16.204 --> 08:18.247
And you heard from her tonight?

08:18.831 --> 08:20.291
I told you that already.

08:20.374 --> 08:23.252
Well, that's interesting,
because I saw her two nights ago

08:23.336 --> 08:25.505
with her throat slit right there.

08:25.588 --> 08:28.841
We were supposed to meet up
two nights ago, and she never showed.

08:33.221 --> 08:35.389
-What's so funny?

08:35.473 --> 08:37.183
-It happened in that window?
-Yeah.

08:37.266 --> 08:40.311
Don't you think it's pretty convenient
that you can see everything over there?

08:40.394 --> 08:42.522
-What are you saying?
-She didn't die two nights ago.

08:42.605 --> 08:44.774
-I bet she faked the whole fucking thing.
-Faked it?

08:44.857 --> 08:46.359
She's smart. She's fucking smart.

08:46.442 --> 08:48.069
I know what I saw!

08:48.152 --> 08:49.904
And she knew you were watching her.

08:49.987 --> 08:53.449
Bored soccer mom with nothing better to do
gets to play detective,

08:53.533 --> 08:55.660
pokes around in her Instagram, finds me.

08:55.743 --> 08:57.578
She knew I'd take the bait.

08:58.704 --> 09:01.082
Why would she want you
to think that she's dead?

09:01.165 --> 09:03.376
So I won't come after her.
So she can keep all the money.

09:03.459 --> 09:04.627
What money?

09:04.710 --> 09:05.920
Neil's money.

09:14.095 --> 09:15.429
You were ripping him off?

09:15.513 --> 09:19.392
That was the plan, but I… I guess
she found a way to do it without me.

09:19.475 --> 09:21.435
I don't understand.

09:22.979 --> 09:24.772
It's a long story.

09:29.860 --> 09:30.861
All right.

09:32.238 --> 09:33.489
Start talking.

09:35.658 --> 09:36.826
I met her at work.

09:36.909 --> 09:38.869
-Where do you work?
-Strip club.

09:38.953 --> 09:40.538
Of course she's a stripper.

09:40.621 --> 09:43.708
She was the bartender. I'm the stripper.

09:46.711 --> 09:52.049
<i> Can I get</i>
<i>a "yeehaw" for Sexy Rexy?</i>

10:05.396 --> 10:08.983
<i>After work one night,</i>
<i>Chastity came backstage to talk to me.</i>

10:09.066 --> 10:10.610
I have a private job
you might be right for.

10:10.693 --> 10:13.321
<i>I assumed she was talking</i>
<i>about a bachelorette party or something.</i>

10:13.404 --> 10:14.405
Who's that?

10:14.488 --> 10:15.906
<i>She had something different in mind.</i>

10:15.990 --> 10:16.907
My boyfriend.

10:16.991 --> 10:18.367
You like 'em old, huh?

10:18.951 --> 10:19.910
I like 'em rich.

10:19.994 --> 10:20.953
<i>A long con.</i>

10:21.037 --> 10:22.955
This is my brother Rex.

10:23.456 --> 10:26.584
<i>She told him I was dying</i>
<i>of a rare blood cancer.</i>

10:26.667 --> 10:30.004
<i>That there was this experimental treatment</i>
<i>that could save my life,</i>

10:30.087 --> 10:31.839
<i>but it wasn't covered by insurance.</i>

10:33.549 --> 10:35.760
<i>She could make herself cry on cue.</i>

10:37.261 --> 10:40.014
<i>Chastity had me open up</i>
<i>a bank account in my name,</i>

10:40.598 --> 10:42.433
<i>but only she knew the PIN number.</i>

10:46.854 --> 10:49.190
<i>Once we got the money,</i>
<i>it was time to move on,</i>

10:49.273 --> 10:51.359
<i>and she had a pretty slick plan for that.</i>

10:51.942 --> 10:54.737
I don't like olives.
Your late wife liked olives.

10:54.820 --> 10:57.907
<i>About a month</i>
<i>after my "successful operation,"</i>

10:57.990 --> 11:00.368
<i>she started getting</i>
<i>into arguments with the guy,</i>

11:00.451 --> 11:02.244
<i>picking fights over nothing,</i>

11:02.328 --> 11:05.539
<i>until finally it was too much for him,</i>
<i>and he kicked her to the curb.</i>

11:05.623 --> 11:06.957
Why don't you just go!

11:09.919 --> 11:12.546
<i>Little did he know</i>
<i>who was at the curb waiting for her.</i>

11:16.717 --> 11:19.679
<i>We did it time and time again.</i>

11:22.306 --> 11:24.058
Oh, 60 grand would be perfect.

11:26.560 --> 11:30.231
<i>Chastity could always find</i>
<i>some poor sucker in the obituary section.</i>

11:45.705 --> 11:47.957
<i>To catch a fish,</i>
<i>you gotta first bait the hook.</i>

11:48.040 --> 11:48.874
Oh God.

11:48.958 --> 11:52.044
<i>And what nice guy is gonna leave</i>
<i>a pretty girl stranded in a parking lot?</i>

11:52.712 --> 11:54.797
Hi. Hi, I'm so sorry.

11:54.880 --> 11:57.216
Uh, my car won't start.

11:57.299 --> 11:59.844
Is there any way that you could help me?

11:59.927 --> 12:01.846
Uh, yeah. Sure.

12:03.889 --> 12:06.684
<i> But to set the hook,</i>
<i>you need a sob story.</i>

12:10.813 --> 12:13.232
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

12:13.899 --> 12:15.234
God, I'm such a mess. Um…

12:16.235 --> 12:20.364
No. It's just that normally I would call
my husband for something like this,

12:20.448 --> 12:21.365
but, um,

12:21.991 --> 12:23.492
he… he died. He…

12:24.493 --> 12:26.120
he died two months ago.

12:27.037 --> 12:28.289
Oh,I'm so sorry.

12:28.372 --> 12:29.957
It's okay. I'm sorry.

12:31.041 --> 12:33.210
I… I know exactly how you feel.

12:35.045 --> 12:37.006
I lost my wife recently.

12:46.640 --> 12:50.144
Oh my God. Thank you so much.

12:51.312 --> 12:54.398
Hey, I… I don't want this
to come across the wrong way.

12:54.482 --> 12:57.401
Um, could I give you my number?

12:57.985 --> 12:59.361
Just… just to chat.

12:59.445 --> 13:02.823
I… I just… I don't know anyone else
who knows what this is like.

13:04.825 --> 13:05.785
Yeah.

13:05.868 --> 13:07.203
-Yeah?
Of course. Yeah.

13:08.871 --> 13:09.914
There you go.

13:24.470 --> 13:27.014
<i>But this one</i>
<i>was complicated from the start.</i>

13:27.681 --> 13:28.808
<i>He had a little kid.</i>

13:28.891 --> 13:30.851
-Oh, here she is.

13:31.352 --> 13:33.103
<i>I never signed up to hurt a kid.</i>

13:33.187 --> 13:36.065
-Oh my goodness.
-Thank you so much. Look at this.

13:36.148 --> 13:37.691
-Is this for me?
So sweet.

13:40.528 --> 13:42.279
<i>I told her I wanted out.</i>

13:42.947 --> 13:45.366
<i>But she reminded me</i>
<i>that it was my name on the bank accounts.</i>

13:45.449 --> 13:46.408
Go back to gyrating.

13:46.492 --> 13:48.160
<i>She could pin the whole thing on me.</i>

13:50.913 --> 13:53.624
<i>And then, there was radio silence.</i>

13:55.000 --> 13:56.168
<i>Until…</i>

13:57.503 --> 13:58.379
tonight.

14:00.506 --> 14:04.176
"Sorry I've been ghosting you.
I had a family emergency."

14:04.885 --> 14:06.929
She could be anywhere by now.

14:07.513 --> 14:08.931
I'm such a fool.

14:09.014 --> 14:09.849
No.

14:10.474 --> 14:11.433
You're not.

14:12.017 --> 14:13.561
She was just using you.

14:16.313 --> 14:18.023
I guess she used me too.

14:18.107 --> 14:19.650
But you didn't deserve it.

14:26.323 --> 14:28.284
Oh fuck. Is that your husband?

14:29.201 --> 14:31.161
Don't worry. He won't come in.

14:33.080 --> 14:34.415
He's my ex-husband.

14:35.082 --> 14:36.166
We're divorced.

14:48.846 --> 14:49.889
Hi.

14:50.472 --> 14:52.725
Hey. So, what's really going on?

14:53.309 --> 14:54.685
Nothing. I just, um…

14:54.768 --> 14:57.605
I th… thought it might rain, so…

14:58.731 --> 14:59.815
-Right.

15:00.941 --> 15:01.775
Are you sure?

15:01.859 --> 15:04.320
We haven't seen each other in forever.

15:04.403 --> 15:06.697
Now I'm the guy
you want to bring you bread?

15:09.074 --> 15:10.618
Yeah. I'm sorry.

15:10.701 --> 15:14.330
I don't… I don't know
what I was thinking. I just…

15:15.247 --> 15:16.290
Old habits.

15:17.917 --> 15:21.211
-I'm worried about you.
-No. Really, I…

15:21.754 --> 15:22.796
I'm fine. I…

15:25.174 --> 15:26.967
just wanted to see a friendly face.

15:27.051 --> 15:29.345
Is that what my face is?

15:30.262 --> 15:31.513
It's friendly?

15:32.139 --> 15:32.973
Shoot.

15:33.057 --> 15:34.600
I always wanted to look, like,

15:35.267 --> 15:36.185
intimidating.

15:36.268 --> 15:37.311
Oh.

15:37.394 --> 15:40.064
-I'm in the FBI, for goodness' sakes.
Yeah.

15:41.607 --> 15:43.025
I think your face is

15:44.234 --> 15:45.069
just right.

15:51.992 --> 15:53.661
-Here.
Oh thanks.

15:53.744 --> 15:55.579
I also got you Red Vines.

15:55.663 --> 15:58.666
They were at checkout.
I know how much you like 'em.

16:00.960 --> 16:01.919
Thank you.

16:02.503 --> 16:04.213
It's really nice to see you.

16:12.054 --> 16:14.598
Guess someone
needs to bring their dog back inside.

16:14.682 --> 16:15.516
Yeah.

16:18.143 --> 16:20.270
-Well, I should get going.
Right.

16:24.858 --> 16:26.235
-Thank you again.
-Yeah.

16:48.382 --> 16:49.925
What the hell are you doing in here?

16:50.009 --> 16:51.969
I'm sorry.
I… I thought I heard something upstairs,

16:52.052 --> 16:53.303
like someone was up here.

16:53.387 --> 16:55.514
And I came to look around,
and I saw her room.

16:55.597 --> 16:58.809
It's an old house. It creaks.

17:01.562 --> 17:02.563
I'm sorry, I…

17:04.273 --> 17:05.774
I shouldn't have come up here.

17:07.484 --> 17:09.278
I'd never hurt your kid, you know.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.491
She used to collect these.

17:14.992 --> 17:18.495
She always wanted the turtle,
but we could never find it.

17:20.748 --> 17:22.166
It was always sold-out.

17:23.500 --> 17:24.793
I bet you were a great mom.

17:27.463 --> 17:28.922
I don't know about that.

17:31.717 --> 17:34.887
Elizabeth told me at breakfast
that it's Take Your Daughter to Work Day.

17:34.970 --> 17:37.264
Oh, honey, I can't. Not today.

17:37.765 --> 17:39.433
There's just so much going on today.

17:39.516 --> 17:43.562
Douglas, please.
It's your daughter. She's so excited.

17:43.645 --> 17:44.480
Anna…

17:44.563 --> 17:46.774
I would take her to work with me,
but I work from home.

17:46.857 --> 17:47.941
That would be no fun.

17:48.025 --> 17:48.984
Douglas,

17:49.943 --> 17:51.612
it would mean so much to her.

17:52.112 --> 17:53.614
Please?

17:56.033 --> 17:57.451
You know I can't say no to you.

18:09.880 --> 18:12.091
It would have been her birthday
on Wednesday.

18:15.344 --> 18:17.304
It was all my fault.

18:18.388 --> 18:20.057
Anna. Anna.

18:20.140 --> 18:21.850
I can't. I'm sorry.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.018
Just please go.

18:24.812 --> 18:25.729
I'm sorry.

18:28.232 --> 18:29.191
I'm sorry.

18:42.830 --> 18:45.499
I haven't been touched
in such a long time.

19:21.910 --> 19:23.704
Oh my God.

22:17.836 --> 22:18.837
