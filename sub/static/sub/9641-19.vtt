00:13.464 --> 00:14.730
Good morning, Alex.

00:14.764 --> 00:16.329
What's so good about it?

00:16.364 --> 00:19.100
This morning, my mom made
me butterfly-shaped waffles.

00:19.134 --> 00:22.967
I mean, it's the crack of dawn,
stop being adorable.

00:23.001 --> 00:26.168
I made those. Your mom is right.

00:26.203 --> 00:28.002
We should just give you dry toast.

00:29.837 --> 00:32.604
Is Max talking to a girl?

00:32.639 --> 00:36.639
I say three seconds before she
yells "gross" and runs away.

00:39.842 --> 00:42.542
She's not running away.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.778
Let's see if we can't figure
out what's wrong with her.

00:46.812 --> 00:48.578
I know it's here someplace.

00:48.613 --> 00:51.079
This morning, I took it
from my bag of dead things.

00:52.748 --> 00:54.214
Give me a second.

00:54.249 --> 00:57.282
Here it is! All right, my lizard.

00:57.316 --> 01:01.350
Well, most of him. His tail
turned to crumbs in my pocket.

01:02.552 --> 01:04.218
Oh, wait, is this cookie crumbs?

01:08.522 --> 01:09.822
No, that's lizard.

01:12.458 --> 01:15.225
- Here you go.
- Aww.

01:15.259 --> 01:18.494
You know what they say,
"If you love something let it go,

01:18.528 --> 01:20.862
if it doesn't come back it was
never yours in the first place."

01:22.098 --> 01:25.032
But, Tom, it's dead.

01:27.934 --> 01:29.868
Max? Hey!

01:33.071 --> 01:36.140
Did you just give this girl
your most prized possession?

01:36.174 --> 01:38.341
You let her have your dead lizard?

01:38.376 --> 01:39.475
But you got all worked up

01:39.510 --> 01:42.711
when I wanted to turn it into a barrette.

01:42.745 --> 01:46.880
- Tom, who are these people?
- I have no idea, Nancy.

01:46.914 --> 01:51.215
And for your information, total strangers,

01:51.249 --> 01:52.816
we're going to some place in the school

01:52.850 --> 01:54.884
where we actually know people.

01:54.918 --> 01:57.720
Tom, you're so funny.

01:57.754 --> 02:01.022
I know, right? Isn't Tom a riot?

02:01.056 --> 02:03.456
Look, Nancy, it's been a
pleasure meeting both of you,

02:03.490 --> 02:06.058
but, um, I need to talk to
my new friend Tom alone.

02:06.093 --> 02:08.526
OK. I'm going to wood
shop to make a shadow box

02:08.561 --> 02:10.595
- to display my dead lizard.
- OK.

02:12.864 --> 02:15.932
Aw, that's how it all started with me.

02:15.966 --> 02:18.233
Shadow boxes are a gateway craft.

02:19.836 --> 02:21.703
Guess what, Tom?

02:21.737 --> 02:24.238
You've been caught in
some kind of lie and I,

02:24.273 --> 02:26.940
being the Queen of All Lies,
need to know what it is.

02:26.975 --> 02:29.241
Well...

02:29.276 --> 02:31.610
Nancy has been my girlfriend for a while.

02:31.644 --> 02:33.812
Oh, my gosh, you have a girlfriend! -

02:33.846 --> 02:35.046
Max, you have a girlfriend.

02:35.080 --> 02:37.114
Wait, wait. OK. OK. OK, I'm sorry.

02:37.148 --> 02:38.482
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

02:38.516 --> 02:42.018
What's wrong with her?
Booger eater? Bathroom snacker?

02:42.052 --> 02:44.854
Snort laugher? What is it?

02:44.888 --> 02:48.056
All that. That's what makes her great.
She's super gross.

02:48.090 --> 02:51.558
Aww. - Aww, you're gonna
be together forever.

02:51.593 --> 02:53.760
Do me a favor, though.
Don't tell Mom and Dad.

02:53.794 --> 02:55.227
I'm afraid they're gonna do something

02:55.262 --> 02:57.029
really embarrassing and scare her away.

02:57.063 --> 03:00.631
Max, I appreciate you wanting
to lie about having our parents,

03:00.665 --> 03:02.899
but changing your first name
isn't going to fool anyone.

03:02.934 --> 03:05.902
Oh, no, I know. But I changed
my last name, too, to Sawyer.

03:05.936 --> 03:08.036
-

03:08.071 --> 03:10.038
- This kid.
- Tom Sawyer?

03:10.072 --> 03:12.439
- Yeah.
- That's such an obvious lie.

03:12.474 --> 03:15.508
It's the name from the Rush song.

03:18.045 --> 03:20.446
And the classic book.

03:20.480 --> 03:24.482
Wow, that song was good,
I didn't know they made a book out of it.

04:26.237 --> 04:29.705
Justin! Justin! Guess what? Guess what?

04:29.739 --> 04:31.640
Max has a girlfriend. -

04:31.675 --> 04:33.475
Girlfriend! It is so cute.

04:33.510 --> 04:35.711
The whole relationship is based on a lie.

04:35.745 --> 04:38.180
I've taught him so well.

04:39.782 --> 04:41.649
What are you talking about?

04:41.684 --> 04:44.519
Max told his new girlfriend, Nancy,
that his name was Tom Sawyer

04:44.553 --> 04:46.487
so that he wouldn't be
embarrassed by your folks.

04:46.521 --> 04:49.389
Maybe he should have gone with
a name a little less obvious,

04:49.424 --> 04:50.757
like Scooby-Doo.

04:52.460 --> 04:54.828
This lie could easily unravel.

04:54.862 --> 04:58.565
Alex, huge problem. My lie is falling apart.

05:03.369 --> 05:05.469
- Sorry.
- Wait, what?

05:05.504 --> 05:07.905
Yeah, Nancy wants to come
over to meet Mom and Dad now.

05:11.943 --> 05:14.077
OK, not a problem. Not a problem.

05:14.111 --> 05:15.512
This is, um...

05:15.546 --> 05:17.413
This is the exciting part of lying.

05:17.447 --> 05:19.382
It's when we get to use our imagination

05:19.416 --> 05:21.717
to make the lie even more spectacular.

05:21.752 --> 05:24.786
I know. I just wish there was a
way Nancy could meet Mom and Dad

05:24.821 --> 05:27.489
without actually meeting Mom and Dad.

05:27.523 --> 05:29.057
Oh, OK.

05:29.091 --> 05:32.260
Justin and I can use a spell to
make each other look ancient.

05:32.294 --> 05:34.228
You know, like how Mom and Dad look.

05:36.064 --> 05:37.564
Why should I do that?

05:37.598 --> 05:40.033
Because your parents are
a little embarrassing.

05:40.067 --> 05:42.034
All my girlfriends have met my parents.

05:42.069 --> 05:43.169
It's been fine.

05:43.203 --> 05:44.770
That's because anyone who dates you

05:44.805 --> 05:46.706
is even more embarrassing than Mom and Dad.

05:46.740 --> 05:48.941
Oh! -

05:48.975 --> 05:50.609
Oh.

05:52.745 --> 05:55.480
Wait for me, will ya?

05:55.514 --> 05:57.515
I can't believe you
talked me into this again.

05:57.549 --> 06:00.184
Oh, it's going to be the best
Civil War reenactment ever.

06:00.219 --> 06:01.520
- -
- This year,

06:01.554 --> 06:04.122
I get to be the first
casualty of the battle.

06:04.156 --> 06:07.225
I get to lay around all
day eating trail mix.

06:08.827 --> 06:12.061
Jerry, putting one peanut
in a bag of chocolates

06:12.095 --> 06:13.694
doesn't make a trail mix.

06:19.300 --> 06:22.101
OK, we need to be the
same age as Mom and Dad.

06:22.135 --> 06:25.103
Ah-ha! Perfect! Middle age spell.

06:25.138 --> 06:27.472
But Mama says she's years
away from middle age.

06:27.506 --> 06:29.807
She also says people mistake
her for your sister.

06:29.842 --> 06:31.609
Her words mean nothing.

06:32.510 --> 06:34.077
All right, well, let's do it.

06:36.180 --> 06:40.282
Make us old and barely alive,
age us up to 35.

06:43.452 --> 06:46.387
Wow. Nice spare tire.

06:46.421 --> 06:48.522
Nice frosting job to hide the grays.

06:48.557 --> 06:50.757
Well, I am clever.

06:53.394 --> 06:55.394
Whoa, nice gut, Justin.

06:55.429 --> 06:58.097
Looks like I dodged a bullet with you.

06:59.366 --> 07:01.667
Just more to love.

07:02.969 --> 07:05.003
Look. Check out my bingo wings.

07:05.037 --> 07:08.539
- Bingo!
- Ew.

07:08.574 --> 07:11.008
All right, look,
I decided to help you guys out

07:11.042 --> 07:12.876
by pretending to be an old family friend.

07:12.911 --> 07:15.412
I'm not good at lying,
so I wrote myself some cue cards.

07:15.446 --> 07:16.813
Name a topic.

07:16.847 --> 07:18.948
- Horses.
- Ah.

07:18.982 --> 07:22.650
Weather... bagels... animals.

07:22.684 --> 07:24.152
Come on animals.

07:24.186 --> 07:25.686
I got nothing.

07:28.389 --> 07:30.090
They're coming. Check it out.

07:30.124 --> 07:31.525
I'm hunched over like an old man,

07:31.559 --> 07:33.327
because of my big gut. -

07:33.361 --> 07:36.029
Hey, wait. Check out this
laugh that turns into a cough.

07:39.632 --> 07:40.832
Are you OK?

07:40.866 --> 07:42.866
- I'm good.
- Oh.

07:45.436 --> 07:48.137
- Oh, honey, we have company. - Ah!

07:48.171 --> 07:50.072
- Hey.
- Hello, son.

07:50.107 --> 07:54.009
- I love you, Daddy.
- Who am I?

07:54.044 --> 07:56.277
- He's my daddy.
- Yeah.

07:58.046 --> 08:00.614
You must be Nancy. Pleasure to meet you.

08:00.649 --> 08:02.816
- I'm Mr. Sawyer. You...
- Aye.

08:02.850 --> 08:04.550
This is my wife over here, Diane.

08:04.584 --> 08:07.519
Ah, Diane Sawyer, nice to meet you.

08:08.921 --> 08:10.621
I'm a lot older than I look.

08:10.655 --> 08:12.823
If you happen to say
something funny, you'll see.

08:12.858 --> 08:14.624
It's nice to meet you.

08:14.658 --> 08:18.361
- -
- Oh, sweetie. Oh, no.

08:18.395 --> 08:20.996
Hello. You guys aren't talking
about horses, are you?

08:21.030 --> 08:22.831
Well...

08:22.865 --> 08:24.999
Didn't I meet you in school the other day?

08:29.937 --> 08:33.337
You did meet her in school the other day
because she's our daughter's friend.

08:33.371 --> 08:36.573
Our daughter's only friend, just to clarify.

08:38.009 --> 08:41.211
You know, you definitely
chose the right son, Nancy,

08:41.246 --> 08:43.880
because our other son is
so uptight and boring...

08:43.914 --> 08:46.382
And his sister doesn't stick
to plans and takes cheap shots.

08:46.416 --> 08:48.818
We are here trying to talk
in front of these people...

08:48.852 --> 08:53.555
But, we are here to talk
about our son, Tom Sawyer.

08:53.590 --> 08:56.224
Just the other day, Nancy, let me tell you,

08:56.258 --> 08:58.192
he whitewashed the entire picket fence.

08:58.226 --> 08:59.660
- Isn't that right, honey?
- Yes, he did.

08:59.694 --> 09:00.961
- Yes, he did.
- That he did.

09:00.995 --> 09:02.930
- What does "whitewash" mean?
- I don't know.

09:02.965 --> 09:04.765
It was never mentioned in the song.

09:07.868 --> 09:09.836
It took me hours to get
dressed up like this,

09:09.870 --> 09:11.871
and in 20 minutes you get us kicked out.

09:11.905 --> 09:14.773
I'm sorry, the flyer
said no flash photography

09:14.807 --> 09:17.641
or tube socks. Nobody said
that I couldn't dip fries

09:17.675 --> 09:19.876
in my ketchup blood when I was dead.

09:19.911 --> 09:22.946
Wait! What's going on here?

09:24.615 --> 09:26.950
Hi, I'm Nancy Lueke. Tom's girlfriend.

09:28.185 --> 09:30.084
OK, Nancy, these are my parents' friends.

09:30.118 --> 09:32.586
We probably don't want to stick
around this old people party

09:32.620 --> 09:34.654
'cause they're probably
going to do something old,

09:34.688 --> 09:36.856
like, you know, call on an old telephone.

09:38.759 --> 09:40.125
Let's go. Come on, this way.

09:40.160 --> 09:41.893
- This way.
- Wait a minute.

09:41.928 --> 09:44.262
Why is that girl calling Max "Tom",

09:44.297 --> 09:49.133
while you two look like you
did some spell to look 35?

09:50.202 --> 09:51.635
We did a middle-age spell.

09:51.670 --> 09:54.604
Thirty-five is not middle-aged!

09:56.340 --> 09:57.907
What's going on here?

09:59.509 --> 10:03.144
OK, Mom. I'm not gonna lie to you.

10:03.178 --> 10:05.178
Um...

10:05.212 --> 10:08.514
Justinnd I are on our way to
an old people reenactment.

10:08.548 --> 10:09.916
And I'm pretty excited about it

10:09.950 --> 10:11.786
because Justin gets to have a heart attack.

10:11.820 --> 10:13.955
That is not the truth.

10:13.989 --> 10:16.958
OK, this is the gonna hurt you guys but,

10:16.992 --> 10:19.193
we're pretending to be
you because Max thought

10:19.227 --> 10:21.962
that you would embarrass him
in front of his new girlfriend.

10:21.997 --> 10:24.031
- Us?
- Us?

10:25.333 --> 10:27.133
I was just being myself.

10:27.168 --> 10:29.502
For example, if you asked
me about something random,

10:29.537 --> 10:31.203
like, I don't know, horses,

10:31.238 --> 10:32.838
I would say something along the lines of:

10:32.872 --> 10:36.707
Did you know a horse's
head weighs 11.84 pounds,

10:36.742 --> 10:39.443
but his heart only weighs ten?

10:39.978 --> 10:41.145
Yeah.

10:43.382 --> 10:45.783
I'm not good at this.

10:50.856 --> 10:55.260
Max, is it true? Are you embarrassed by us?

10:55.294 --> 10:58.129
But we're the young, cool parents.

10:58.163 --> 11:00.430
I mean, who else would dress like this?

11:00.465 --> 11:02.399
Kids love the Civil War.

11:03.667 --> 11:07.202
Um, look, Mom, Dad, I didn't do this

11:07.236 --> 11:08.870
'cause I was embarrassed by you guys.

11:08.905 --> 11:13.007
- You didn't?
- No, I...

11:13.041 --> 11:15.042
I did this because I
didn't want Nancy to know

11:15.076 --> 11:16.810
I'm Justin's and Alex's brother.

11:16.844 --> 11:18.545
Oh!

11:20.115 --> 11:21.682
What?!

11:21.716 --> 11:25.118
Everywhere I go, people expect
me to be as devious as you are

11:25.152 --> 11:26.853
or as smart as you are.

11:26.887 --> 11:30.288
I just wanted somebody who
doesn't compare me to anybody.

11:30.322 --> 11:34.525
Because I have a feeling I'll only be
good when I'm not compared to anybody.

11:36.360 --> 11:38.161
Aw, Maxie, I understand.

11:38.196 --> 11:40.463
It's hard being the youngest of three.

11:40.497 --> 11:43.765
I can't believe he's getting
all of your sympathy.

11:43.800 --> 11:45.367
He's the one that was lying.

11:45.401 --> 11:47.802
I don't get your sympathy when I lie.

11:47.837 --> 11:50.838
I'm no expert, but that's
probably why I keep doing it.

11:52.173 --> 11:54.774
Maxie, telling the truth is the only way

11:54.809 --> 11:56.343
to have a real relationship.

11:56.377 --> 11:57.911
If you're gonna have a girlfriend,

11:57.945 --> 11:59.745
you have to show her who you really are.

11:59.780 --> 12:03.082
If you come clean,
I think she'll like you more.

12:04.284 --> 12:07.052
All right. All right, I'll do it.

12:09.122 --> 12:11.057
Yeah, good lucwith that.

12:11.091 --> 12:13.058
The truth is only good for two things:

12:13.093 --> 12:16.027
getting grounded and getting
someone else grounded.

12:16.062 --> 12:19.163
- Speaking of grounded...
- Um...

12:19.197 --> 12:21.397
You know if you weren't
gonna say anything, I was.

12:21.432 --> 12:23.132
What are we gonna do with her? -

12:23.167 --> 12:24.434
Hey?

12:24.468 --> 12:26.469
Mr. Sawyer, nice to meet you.

12:33.845 --> 12:37.213
Oh, man, being old is hard.

12:37.248 --> 12:38.815
Let me tell you, when I get old,

12:38.849 --> 12:42.017
I'm just gonna sit around
and read magazines.

12:42.052 --> 12:43.352
That's what you do anyway.

12:44.621 --> 12:46.988
I'm practicing for later.

12:50.425 --> 12:52.759
I did it. I told Nancy the truth.

12:52.794 --> 12:54.561
We are very proud of you, Max.

12:54.595 --> 12:57.196
Aw, isn't it easier
telling the truth, honey?

12:57.231 --> 12:58.297
It really is.

12:58.332 --> 13:00.933
I am so relieved I told her I'm a wizard.

13:00.967 --> 13:03.235
-

13:03.269 --> 13:05.337
You what?!

13:09.130 --> 13:12.899
Max, when I told you to
tell the truth to Nancy,

13:12.933 --> 13:15.067
I meant to tell her the
truth about being a Russo

13:15.102 --> 13:16.502
not about being a wizard!

13:16.536 --> 13:19.337
You wanted me to tell the
truth but not the whole truth?

13:19.372 --> 13:23.074
This truth thing is confusing,
Mom, to tell you the truth.

13:24.743 --> 13:26.977
Yeah, I mean, you tell the truth,
you get in trouble.

13:27.012 --> 13:28.645
You lie, you get in trouble.

13:28.680 --> 13:31.248
We're probably just better off
not talking to each other.

13:31.282 --> 13:33.950
What did Nancy say when you told her?

13:33.985 --> 13:35.518
She didn't really believe me.

13:35.553 --> 13:36.753
- Ah.
- Phew.

13:36.787 --> 13:38.154
- Thank goodness.
- Whew.

13:38.188 --> 13:40.255
Max, you really need to work on how

13:40.289 --> 13:42.223
you give out information
when you tell a story.

13:42.257 --> 13:44.191
I mean, if I had a ketchup bottle in my hand

13:44.226 --> 13:46.360
when you said you told her,
I would've squeezed it

13:46.395 --> 13:49.131
and ketchup would've been everywhere.

13:50.566 --> 13:52.467
Harper, please hand me the ketchup?

13:52.501 --> 13:53.835
Oh.

13:53.869 --> 13:56.471
But then I took her on a
magic flying carpet ride

13:56.506 --> 13:57.872
and she totally believed me.

14:01.343 --> 14:04.745
Man, it was so much fun,
we even got hit with bird poop.

14:04.779 --> 14:06.246
You did what?

14:06.280 --> 14:08.281
We got hit with bird poop.

14:09.650 --> 14:11.417
Nancy Lueke has seen magic!

14:11.452 --> 14:13.286
I'm gonna file a wizard incident report.

14:13.321 --> 14:14.487
And if you don't fix this,

14:14.522 --> 14:16.422
I'm gonna sign it and I'm gonna send it.

14:16.457 --> 14:18.625
We cannot be wizards exposed!

14:18.659 --> 14:23.963
Max, what if this Nancy Lueke sells
her story to the magazines, huh?

14:23.997 --> 14:25.931
We'll be hounded by paparazzi.

14:25.965 --> 14:29.401
We won't be able to go anywhere without
somebody wanting to take our picture.

14:29.435 --> 14:31.369
Wait a minute.

14:32.905 --> 14:34.438
You guys are worrying way too much.

14:34.473 --> 14:35.939
Nancy promised she wouldn't say anything.

14:35.974 --> 14:38.208
Trust me. She's dying to tell someone.

14:38.242 --> 14:40.476
The only reason I haven't told
anyone is because I live here

14:40.511 --> 14:42.011
and I don't want to get kicked out.

14:42.045 --> 14:44.713
Well, there you go. We have
Nancy move in. Problem solved.

14:46.214 --> 14:49.616
Nancy's parents are not as cool as mine

14:49.650 --> 14:50.951
to let her live here.

14:50.985 --> 14:52.585
Don't say anything.

14:52.620 --> 14:54.453
The only reason this situation makes sense

14:54.488 --> 14:57.656
is because I tell myself
my parents are cool.

14:57.690 --> 15:01.759
All right, all we have
to do is convince Nancy

15:01.794 --> 15:03.361
we're not wizards.

15:03.395 --> 15:06.330
I can't believe I'm about to say this,

15:06.364 --> 15:10.000
but we need to come up
with a really big lie.

15:13.904 --> 15:15.138
Uh-uh. Don't look at me.

15:15.172 --> 15:16.639
I'm starting to think that lying

15:16.673 --> 15:18.374
isn't the best thing in the world.

15:18.408 --> 15:22.210
Oh, you do not clean up
your act now, young lady.

15:22.244 --> 15:25.312
Harper, would you hand me an eclair, please?

15:25.346 --> 15:27.180
Well, Nancy's gonna be here in an hour

15:27.214 --> 15:28.881
for another magic flying carpet ride.

15:28.916 --> 15:31.350
- Did I forget to mention that?
- An hour?!

15:33.386 --> 15:34.852
We're in the face of an emergency

15:34.887 --> 15:37.154
and you're kicking back reading a magazine?

15:37.189 --> 15:41.194
Flipping through a magazine
is how I come up with my lies.

15:44.397 --> 15:46.564
- I've got it.
- You do?

15:46.599 --> 15:48.899
I know how Jennifer can get Brad back.

15:48.934 --> 15:50.200
Wow.

15:50.235 --> 15:52.169
She has nothing.

15:53.137 --> 15:55.472
Justin, you got anything?

15:55.506 --> 15:57.441
I've got it. But I'm gonna need a blender,

15:57.475 --> 15:59.209
a box spring and your ten speed bike.

15:59.244 --> 16:02.145
OK, but I'm gonna need a half
an hour to make a smoothie,

16:02.180 --> 16:05.815
take a nap and... find that bike.

16:16.492 --> 16:19.093
Mom, what's Justin doing back there?

16:19.127 --> 16:21.427
I really like this girl.
This is why I didn't want her

16:21.462 --> 16:23.062
to know I was related to any of you.

16:23.096 --> 16:25.898
It's making sense to all of us now, son.

16:27.367 --> 16:30.237
- I've got a plan.
- Oh, good,

16:30.271 --> 16:32.505
because Nancy Lueke's
gonna be here any minute

16:32.540 --> 16:35.074
and I don't know how that chaos
outside is going to help us.

16:35.109 --> 16:38.678
There's only one thing we should do.

16:38.712 --> 16:40.146
We have to stick to the truth

16:40.180 --> 16:42.582
and accept the consequences of our actions.

16:43.850 --> 16:46.118
It is so sad to see you this way.

16:47.855 --> 16:49.488
She's here.

16:49.523 --> 16:51.557
Jerry, what are we gonna do?

16:51.591 --> 16:55.127
I don't know. I'm still a
little groggy from my nap.

17:05.540 --> 17:10.577
- Hey, wizard boyfriend.
- Hi, Nancy, come here for a minute.

17:10.612 --> 17:13.613
Look, I know you came for
your magic flying carpet ride,

17:13.647 --> 17:16.049
but there's something I gotta tell you.

17:17.651 --> 17:22.686
- I'm really not a wizard.
- Of course you're a wizard.

17:22.722 --> 17:24.622
You told me how your brother and sister

17:24.656 --> 17:26.858
used magic to make themselves look old.

17:26.892 --> 17:30.828
And how you have a wizard lair, there's a
wizard world and a wizard competition.

17:30.862 --> 17:33.930
Is there anything you didn't tell her?

17:33.965 --> 17:36.065
Yeah, I didn't tell her
about the dragon dog,

17:36.100 --> 17:39.301
'cause I still have no
idea what happened to that.

17:39.336 --> 17:44.006
Nancy Lueke, come on out.
Everything's all set.

17:44.040 --> 17:45.574
Just right through here.

17:47.810 --> 17:49.475
- OK.
- Look!

17:49.510 --> 17:52.010
It's the magic flying
carpet Max took me on...

17:52.045 --> 17:54.745
Mm-hmm. -...attached
to a bunch of garbage.

17:54.780 --> 17:57.414
This is very exciting, yes,
it is a carpet, all right.

17:57.449 --> 17:58.882
But it's not magical, no.

17:58.916 --> 18:04.152
It moves because it has a
motor and gears and springs.

18:04.186 --> 18:08.690
- We're not a family of wizards.
- No.

18:08.724 --> 18:12.725
We are a passionate, amateur
special effects enthusiasts family.

18:12.760 --> 18:15.060
Yes. Yes, that is what we are.

18:15.095 --> 18:17.996
We are ama... special, what?

18:18.030 --> 18:20.164
I always thought this
family would be brought down

18:20.198 --> 18:22.166
by some strange creature
from another dimension,

18:22.200 --> 18:24.200
not by a little girl from...

18:24.235 --> 18:26.202
- Where are you from, sweetie?
- Riverdale.

18:26.236 --> 18:27.603
There you go. Rich kid.

18:27.637 --> 18:28.704
Hmm.

18:28.738 --> 18:31.439
OK, hop on our non-magic flying carpet.

18:31.473 --> 18:32.974
Very non-magical.

18:33.008 --> 18:37.078
Right here. OK, you guys ready
for quote unquote "take-off?"

18:37.112 --> 18:38.212
As they would say.

18:38.246 --> 18:40.747
-

18:42.216 --> 18:43.583
-

18:46.520 --> 18:47.920
Mom, Dad, the screen.

18:50.623 --> 18:54.458
Were you flying over New
York City, like this?

18:59.463 --> 19:01.163
Nice try but I know the difference

19:01.197 --> 19:03.532
between bulls and New York.

19:03.566 --> 19:07.802
Wrong button. Like I said,
amateur special effects enthusiasts.

19:09.871 --> 19:12.640
Whoa! It looks like we're flying.

19:12.674 --> 19:14.308
OK, I'll give you that.

19:14.342 --> 19:17.044
But I'm not stupid.
It was windy when we were flying.

19:17.078 --> 19:20.213
Yes, it was windy. Perhaps like this?

19:23.383 --> 19:26.184
Yes, yes, that's the wind.

19:26.218 --> 19:27.919
But we got hit by bird poop.

19:27.953 --> 19:30.054
I don't see any bird poop here.

19:30.088 --> 19:32.656
Bird poop. Bird poop.
I forgot the bird poop.

19:34.792 --> 19:36.392
Catch.

19:37.794 --> 19:40.095
Jerry, don't eat it. Squeeze it.

19:40.129 --> 19:41.362
Oh.

19:45.767 --> 19:50.237
Oh, my gosh! This is like
the ride you took me on.

19:51.472 --> 19:53.572
This tastes nothing like bird poop.

20:03.482 --> 20:06.717
You really are passionate amateur
special effects enthusiasts.

20:06.752 --> 20:08.219
Yes! That's what we are.

20:08.253 --> 20:09.854
Special... that.

20:11.623 --> 20:14.191
I've never met a family where
everyone had the same hobby.

20:14.226 --> 20:16.794
That's because we are very close.

20:16.828 --> 20:18.929
- A close knit family.
- Uh-huh.

20:18.964 --> 20:21.498
I mean, come on, let's just hug it out.
Come on, hug it out.

20:27.071 --> 20:28.772
- Mm-mm.
- Ow, ow, ow, ow.

20:30.174 --> 20:32.575
Is this really the way you guys hug?

20:32.610 --> 20:35.245
You are a sad, sad bunch.

20:36.881 --> 20:40.050
- Who's got my wallet?
- Sorry.

20:42.386 --> 20:44.855
All right, so Nancy, now that we've got
this whole carpet thing cleared up,

20:44.889 --> 20:46.957
what do you say we go play
cards in the wizards' lair?

20:46.991 --> 20:49.759
We don't have a wizards' lair, no.

20:51.995 --> 20:54.563
I'm breaking up with you, Max.

20:54.598 --> 20:56.665
What? Why?

20:56.700 --> 20:59.134
You keep lying to get me to like you.

20:59.169 --> 21:02.204
The only way I can get the
truth is from your family.

21:03.740 --> 21:05.874
Truth? From my family?

21:08.177 --> 21:11.079
And I'm keeping the dead lizard.

21:11.113 --> 21:12.847
It deserves better than you.

21:17.286 --> 21:20.688
I'm sorry, Max. Phew, that was a close one.

21:20.722 --> 21:23.224
I was starting to think that
telling the truth was better.

21:23.258 --> 21:25.626
But then Justin's lie fixed everything.

21:25.661 --> 21:29.997
Oh, come on, let's just face it.
We're a family full of liars

21:30.032 --> 21:32.366
who don't know how to hug. I love you guys.

21:32.401 --> 21:34.268
Good night. Harper, come on.

21:34.302 --> 21:36.304
Fine.

21:36.338 --> 21:38.973
No, Justin didn't fix everything.

21:39.007 --> 21:42.208
It's 'cause of lying, I lost the
most important thing in my life.

21:42.243 --> 21:46.478
Oh, Max, I know it's hard to lose
your first girlfriend, honey.

21:46.513 --> 21:48.982
- I'm so sorry.
- What, Nancy?

21:49.017 --> 21:54.854
No, I'm talking about my lizard, Mom.
I'm gonna miss that crumbly little guy.

21:54.889 --> 21:56.689
Was gonna sprinkle him on my salad.

22:03.268 --> 22:04.936
Hello, Broadway.

22:04.970 --> 22:07.571
Yo, Brooklyn, how you doin', heh?

22:07.606 --> 22:11.308
Washington Heights...

22:13.044 --> 22:14.877
I'm a wizard!

22:14.912 --> 22:17.513
I'm flying all by myself!

22:19.048 --> 22:23.084
Oh! Well, look who wants to be a wizard now.

22:24.318 --> 22:25.651
Go to bed, Mom.

22:25.686 --> 22:28.053
Oh, Alex, I don't want
to be a wizard, please.
