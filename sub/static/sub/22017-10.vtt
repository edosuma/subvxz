00:20.585 --> 00:22.925
- You stole my song.
- You've been playing me this whole time?

07:29.974 --> 07:33.789
Oh, man, I... I don't even know.

07:40.016 --> 07:43.985

07:51.246 --> 07:54.316
You know? And then
you just turned.

07:54.319 --> 07:56.265
That's why I was
there, to apologize.

07:56.267 --> 07:58.400
I was wrong.

07:58.402 --> 07:59.735
But still, I...

07:59.737 --> 08:02.290

08:02.293 --> 08:03.906

08:10.585 --> 08:12.114

08:12.116 --> 08:13.988
I got some cash to
promote your music

08:13.991 --> 08:15.605
because I saw they
dropped your single

08:15.608 --> 08:17.251

no downloads.

08:17.254 --> 08:18.554
You ain't getting no play.

08:18.556 --> 08:21.389

hustling you.

08:30.634 --> 08:32.191

08:32.193 --> 08:33.784
You know, it's only been

08:33.788 --> 08:35.424

08:35.428 --> 08:38.043
You don't have to go in

I'm here.

08:41.451 --> 08:43.384

08:50.865 --> 08:53.266
I set a meeting with
Maurice at the label.

08:53.269 --> 08:54.957
You can't go. You just got home.

08:54.959 --> 08:57.125

08:59.096 --> 09:02.164

09:06.036 --> 09:08.769

burned down my own salon.

09:08.772 --> 09:10.102
You know what, Miss Carlotta?

09:10.105 --> 09:12.040
Let us go down there
and talk to Maurice.

09:12.042 --> 09:14.743
- You got all this going on.
- I'm your manager.

09:14.745 --> 09:17.112

- No, please.

09:17.115 --> 09:19.429

09:24.684 --> 09:26.951
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

09:26.954 --> 09:28.853
We'll behave.

09:28.856 --> 09:30.425
Prove it.

Got a bundle of 32-inch
Brazilian in the car,

09:55.452 --> 09:56.885
if you're nice.

09:56.887 --> 09:58.987
I ain't talking to you.

10:00.631 --> 10:04.700
I got the detectives
telling me I'm a suspect

10:04.703 --> 10:07.095
because my name is
on the insurance.

10:07.097 --> 10:10.999
I got no money coming in and
I'm up to my ass in debt.

10:11.001 --> 10:14.012
And because that girl
got killed in the fire,

10:14.015 --> 10:16.070
it's a homicide now.

10:16.073 --> 10:18.307
They came by my crib yesterday.

10:18.309 --> 10:20.475
Somebody told them you fired me.

10:20.477 --> 10:22.312
They thought I was a suspect.

10:25.159 --> 10:27.153
I had no parts in this.

10:27.156 --> 10:30.752
This was just as much my house
as it was yours, Cotton's,

10:30.754 --> 10:32.554
and them little hateful girls.

10:34.058 --> 10:35.836
We gonna rebuild this.

10:41.298 --> 10:43.665
With everything.

10:43.667 --> 10:46.702
The girls, the salon...

10:46.704 --> 10:47.836
Your wigs.

10:47.838 --> 10:49.538
My wigs.

10:49.540 --> 10:51.640
My wigs.

10:54.078 --> 10:56.912
26 years burned down.

10:58.304 --> 11:01.090
All because of your sorry ass.

11:01.093 --> 11:03.652
Hi, Ma.

11:03.654 --> 11:05.192
Cassie.

11:05.195 --> 11:06.594
Hey, Miss Christine.

11:06.597 --> 11:07.629
Hey.

11:07.632 --> 11:08.887
Where you been, heifer?

11:08.890 --> 11:10.792
- Bitch, where <i>you</i> been?
- You miss me?

11:11.929 --> 11:14.663
- So what's the tea?
- They saying it's arson.

11:14.665 --> 11:15.931
Was that before or after

11:15.933 --> 11:17.466
the health department
shut it down?

11:17.468 --> 11:19.167
You know what? I'm not even
going there with you today.

11:19.169 --> 11:20.887
You ain't going nowhere,
because this place

11:20.890 --> 11:22.773
is burnt boots. I don't
know if you've noticed.

11:22.776 --> 11:23.972
Cassie, you're really trying it.

11:23.974 --> 11:25.482
Carlotta ain't the
one for that today.

11:25.484 --> 11:27.376
- Well, neither am I.
- Well, I got a pocketful

11:27.378 --> 11:28.844
of ass-whuppings,
just say the word.

11:28.846 --> 11:31.113
Oh, please, Carlotta, ain't
nobody scared of you!

11:31.115 --> 11:33.231
You should be, many times
as I whupped your ass!

11:33.234 --> 11:34.783
- That's what you thought.
- No, that's what I did.

11:34.785 --> 11:36.518
Enough. I didn't
come here for this.

11:36.520 --> 11:38.053
What you come here for, Ma?

11:38.055 --> 11:40.833
She's here because I called her.
We need help.

11:42.158 --> 11:45.459
You're already broke,
dreams burnt down.

11:45.462 --> 11:48.395
You ain't got no room
for pride, girl.

11:58.351 --> 12:00.051
Oh, my God!

12:05.058 --> 12:07.051
I know all the words
to your songs.

12:07.054 --> 12:09.360
Noah, Noah, your boo's here.

12:13.700 --> 12:15.500
Hey, smile.

12:15.502 --> 12:17.003
Kiss her! Kiss her! Kiss her!
Kiss her!

12:17.005 --> 12:18.002
Oh, no, no.

12:18.004 --> 12:21.606
I know that <i>he</i> won the showcase,
but it feels like they both did.

12:21.608 --> 12:23.197
Let's go.

12:23.200 --> 12:25.056
Aren't you gonna wait for Alex?

12:25.059 --> 12:27.092
She ain't waiting for us.

12:35.221 --> 12:37.188
Hey.

12:37.190 --> 12:38.923
I thought those
fans were for me,

12:38.925 --> 12:40.792
but they were all
about you and Noah.

12:40.794 --> 12:42.803
I know. It's crazy.

12:42.806 --> 12:45.212
How you been? Been
trying to reach you.

12:45.215 --> 12:46.664
- My bad.
- What? You and Noah

12:46.666 --> 12:48.499
been holed up,
getting it in, huh?

12:48.501 --> 12:50.501
That kiss was a mistake.

12:51.838 --> 12:54.305
- Derek found us backstage, and we...
- Wait.

12:54.308 --> 12:56.742
Derek literally
rolled up on y'all?

12:58.212 --> 13:00.011
It's not funny, GiGi.

13:00.013 --> 13:02.380
He kicked me out.

13:02.382 --> 13:05.183
I haven't even picked
up my stuff yet.

13:05.185 --> 13:09.287
I've got to work with Noah
to get this radio play.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.298
I can get y'all on the radio.

13:11.301 --> 13:13.525
I'm doing this pop-up
shop at this loft.

13:13.528 --> 13:15.692
Premiering my new joint.

13:15.695 --> 13:18.296
What if I get you guys
to sing on a track,

13:18.298 --> 13:21.199
and then direct my fans
to your track? Boom.

13:21.201 --> 13:24.029
- Boom?
- Done, bitch, done.

13:24.032 --> 13:25.765
Let's roll.

13:29.642 --> 13:32.009
I told you that place could've
made us a lot of money.

13:32.011 --> 13:34.445
But no, your ass wanted
a clean business.

13:34.447 --> 13:36.781
- Look at it now.
- I don't know why you talking.

13:36.783 --> 13:39.209
As many welfare checks and
Social Security Numbers

13:39.212 --> 13:42.353
as I faked for you,
consider us even.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.655
Mama, don't let this bitch
get your blood pressure...

13:44.665 --> 13:46.330
- "Bitch"?
- All raised up. Yeah. Bitch.

13:46.333 --> 13:48.058
We got business to take care of.

13:48.061 --> 13:51.062
And what would that be?
No, let me guess.

13:51.064 --> 13:52.697
You want me to reopen the salon

13:52.700 --> 13:55.366
so I can start cleaning a
couple hundred thousand, huh?

13:55.369 --> 13:57.935
I ain't stupid. I
know this family.

13:57.937 --> 14:00.638
- We have an offer to buy.
- I ain't interested.

14:00.640 --> 14:03.007
Carlotta, please. You know
the salon and the house

14:03.009 --> 14:06.344
- is in Mama's name.
- And mine.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.179
Ain't no sale without me.

14:11.915 --> 14:13.443
She getting fat, Ma.

14:13.446 --> 14:15.820
You need to tell her to
lose a couple pounds.

14:17.790 --> 14:20.357
My man like my pounds.

14:20.360 --> 14:23.394
Hey, Grandma.

14:23.396 --> 14:27.532
I-It's not strange having
them stay here, is it?

14:27.534 --> 14:28.833
No.

14:30.235 --> 14:33.103
We, um...

14:33.106 --> 14:35.406
all saw that kiss.

14:37.342 --> 14:40.510
She made a mistake. I
know you love her.

14:40.520 --> 14:43.588
You know, Grandma, I don't
want to talk about that.

14:45.251 --> 14:48.219
All right, honey, you a grown man.
I respect that.

14:55.009 --> 14:56.485
Do it again.

15:02.335 --> 15:04.435
How long has this
been happening?

15:04.437 --> 15:08.239
Since the showcase.

15:10.276 --> 15:12.826
I'm-a get you a new therapist.

15:12.829 --> 15:14.478
Grandma.

15:14.480 --> 15:16.547
Uh, how you gonna pay for that?

15:16.549 --> 15:18.382
We still don't have
my settlement check.

15:18.384 --> 15:21.052
If you can find a way
to move that foot,

15:21.054 --> 15:23.524
I'm-a find a way to
pay for that therapy.

15:26.292 --> 15:28.125
All right.

15:28.127 --> 15:29.594
What country is this?

15:29.596 --> 15:32.096
I see you've made
yourself comfortable.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.399
Where's Carlotta?

15:33.402 --> 15:35.235
She had to do some
stuff with the salon,

15:35.238 --> 15:37.104
so we came here to
handle our business.

15:37.107 --> 15:40.008
Which is telling you to put
our damn song on the radio.

15:40.011 --> 15:41.310
Please.

15:41.313 --> 15:42.922
Single's online.

15:42.925 --> 15:45.325
- People are hearing it.
- Not enough people.

15:45.328 --> 15:48.427
We need plays right now, or
we're going back to square one.

15:48.430 --> 15:50.214
You know that, right?

15:50.216 --> 15:52.693
Can you hear the fans outside
yelling Alex's name?

15:52.696 --> 15:54.280
We got heat.

15:54.292 --> 15:55.887
They're not screaming
"Alex and Take Three."

15:55.889 --> 15:58.022
They're screaming "Alex and
Noah." That's what I hear.

15:58.024 --> 16:00.324
- Take Three's not a priority.
- But what if

16:00.326 --> 16:02.960
we're on GiGi's new track,
at the pop-up tonight?

16:02.962 --> 16:05.763
GiGi telling me she wants us to
premiere the new song with her.

16:05.766 --> 16:09.635
After the gig, she'll drop it
online with links to Take Three.

16:11.544 --> 16:13.951
Sounds like Take Three
just became a priority.

16:13.961 --> 16:17.015
You make that happen,
y'all back in the game.

16:22.579 --> 16:26.755
Mr. Rivera. I warned you to
stop working and get some rest.

16:26.758 --> 16:28.974
Look, Doc, when can I get
the hell out of here?

16:28.977 --> 16:30.790
You know, you're a lucky man.

16:30.793 --> 16:33.157
The amount of cocaine you took,

16:33.159 --> 16:35.093
you should be dead,
given your condition.

16:35.095 --> 16:37.028
You have a bad heart.

16:37.030 --> 16:40.754
You need to take it easy,
which means less stress,

16:40.757 --> 16:43.724
less alcohol and definitely
no more cocaine.

16:43.727 --> 16:46.771
As a matter of fact, you'll
want to consider rehab.

16:46.773 --> 16:49.430
Next time, you might
not be so lucky.

16:51.978 --> 16:53.778
<i>Do not scream.</i>

16:53.780 --> 16:55.313
<i>I'm-a do whatever it takes.</i>

16:55.316 --> 16:57.916
<i>You're not living
without me, Cotton.</i>

17:01.649 --> 17:03.554
You ain't acting right.

17:03.556 --> 17:06.190
I'm okay.

17:06.192 --> 17:09.055
Why did you really call
me to come down here?

17:09.058 --> 17:11.329
I-I just want you and
Mama to make up.

17:11.330 --> 17:12.730
When pigs fly.

17:12.732 --> 17:14.398
Come on, let's go get
something to eat.

17:14.401 --> 17:16.676
Let's go get one of those
Patti peach cobblers.

17:16.680 --> 17:19.671
That's diabetes in a box.
We'll be fat.

17:19.673 --> 17:22.339
You ain't the only one who
know how to duct and tuck.

17:30.483 --> 17:32.116
Okay. That should be good.

17:32.118 --> 17:35.720
GiGi wants us to come in
after the second verse.

17:35.722 --> 17:38.079
How it is, uh, staying
at Miss Ruby's?

17:38.082 --> 17:41.157
You mean Derek's? What's
going on with y'all?

17:45.265 --> 17:48.066
I'm sorry. One sec. It's Noah.

17:48.068 --> 17:50.635
Yep?

17:50.637 --> 17:53.137
Why can't we just
switch it to tomorrow?

17:53.139 --> 17:55.807
I'm rehearsing right now.

17:57.343 --> 17:58.910
Fine.

17:58.912 --> 18:00.611
Yeah, I'll see you there.

18:04.084 --> 18:07.151
You guys can, uh,
start without me.

18:07.153 --> 18:09.921
They want me to do a
photo spread with Noah.

18:09.923 --> 18:12.290
Star.

18:15.328 --> 18:18.229
You know what?

18:18.231 --> 18:20.298
I'm doing this for us.

18:20.300 --> 18:22.133
I mean, she ain't
bitching, she's just...

18:22.135 --> 18:24.736
you know, Star ain't good
with her feelings, so...

18:24.738 --> 18:26.969
What about you? You are?

18:29.375 --> 18:31.576
You haven't said one
word about Karen.

18:31.578 --> 18:37.263
I mean, I didn't talk about her
much before she died, so...

18:37.266 --> 18:39.117
Yeah, but why?

18:39.119 --> 18:41.119
You know we have
your back, Simone.

18:41.121 --> 18:44.989
Yeah, well, it's just 'cause,

18:44.991 --> 18:47.558
at first, it wasn't
nothing, you know?

18:47.560 --> 18:49.087
It was...

18:49.090 --> 18:51.361
I mean, we were cool, we were
friends, and being into her

18:51.364 --> 18:54.938
just... it just
happened, all at once.

18:54.941 --> 18:57.668
Like, before I even knew I was
feeling that way, I was done.

18:57.670 --> 19:01.205
- I was just...
- You were already in.

19:01.207 --> 19:03.841
Yeah.

19:03.843 --> 19:07.107
Well... you guys
don't have anything

19:07.110 --> 19:09.480
to worry about with me and Noah.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.349
Yeah.

19:11.351 --> 19:13.040
Yeah, 'cause it's
all fake, right?

19:13.043 --> 19:14.290
Yeah.

19:16.860 --> 19:19.190
Well...

19:19.192 --> 19:22.059
That kiss that you guys
shared at the showcase...

19:22.061 --> 19:25.263
That wasn't the only time?

19:25.265 --> 19:27.454
I'm gonna be late.

19:32.539 --> 19:35.473
Can we get a fresh battery
on this camera over here?

19:35.475 --> 19:37.775
Yeah, we'll be ready
in about five minutes.

19:37.777 --> 19:38.985
Looks real.

19:38.988 --> 19:41.617
So the interviewer wants to ask
you guys a couple questions

19:41.620 --> 19:43.633
about the video and the kiss,

19:43.636 --> 19:45.983
and, uh, she's gonna
take it from there.

19:45.985 --> 19:48.868
Why are you here?
Where's Rachel?

19:48.871 --> 19:50.927
Rachel's probably out day
drinking with the rest

19:50.930 --> 19:53.001
of the people that quit
when Ayanna got fired.

19:53.004 --> 19:55.025
Charles Floyd is up there
in the office rearranging

19:55.028 --> 19:56.529
God knows what, and Angel and I,

19:56.532 --> 19:58.329
we're just trying to
get our singles off.

19:58.331 --> 20:00.765
Well, we don't have any
radio play, either.

20:00.767 --> 20:04.001
Hmm. That's interesting.

20:04.003 --> 20:07.327
Only person that ain't got to
put in work around here is you.

20:07.330 --> 20:09.623
So, what, you jealous, now?

20:09.626 --> 20:13.969
Man, I'm just trying to see if
history will repeat itself.

20:18.571 --> 20:21.080
Hatin' ass.

20:27.290 --> 20:29.626
Um, look, I-I heard
about the fire.

20:29.629 --> 20:32.363
I'm sorry about Carlotta. You
know, she's good people.

20:32.372 --> 20:35.755
Yeah. Which is why I should
be with her right now

20:35.758 --> 20:37.998
instead of at this wack
interview with you.

20:38.001 --> 20:41.606
I'm doing this for radio
play, for Take Three.

20:41.608 --> 20:43.719
That's it. That's all this is.

21:03.425 --> 21:06.426
Wow. New album, new image.

21:06.428 --> 21:08.317
Frickin' big-ass pictures.

21:13.033 --> 21:15.267
It should've been us.

21:15.270 --> 21:16.817
Where's GiGi at?

21:16.820 --> 21:18.458
She said she'd meet us here.

21:18.461 --> 21:19.861
And she's still at the studio,

21:19.864 --> 21:22.575
making some final
touches on the track.

21:22.577 --> 21:25.974
So, Alex, you gonna be all
about Take Three tonight?

21:25.977 --> 21:27.510
Instead of Noah's boo?

21:27.513 --> 21:29.282
Look, if you have
something to say to me,

21:29.284 --> 21:30.984
I suggest you say it right now.

21:30.986 --> 21:32.700
I just did. Let's get dressed.

21:32.703 --> 21:34.203
That's what I thought.

21:34.206 --> 21:36.573
Hey, I'll be back.
Can you hold this?

21:36.576 --> 21:39.310
Yeah. Don't go far.

21:39.313 --> 21:41.627
I just bought this. Gonna
renovate it, paint it,

21:41.630 --> 21:43.730
you know what I'm
saying, rent it out...

21:43.732 --> 21:45.755
- Hey, Noah Brooks.
- What's up, Simone?

21:45.758 --> 21:47.067
Yo, you a dog.

21:47.070 --> 21:49.494
Hey, give me, give me a second.

21:49.497 --> 21:50.936
Give me a second.

21:50.939 --> 21:52.772
- Why you coming for me like this?
- You got

21:52.774 --> 21:55.208
both of them girls thinking that
they got something with you.

21:55.210 --> 21:57.580
You know, Star don't open up
to nobody, and she was about

21:57.583 --> 22:00.313
to open up to your crazy
ass, and you played her.

22:00.315 --> 22:02.615
Okay, listen, you got it
all twisted, all right?

22:02.617 --> 22:04.217
Star ain't want nothing
to do with me.

22:04.219 --> 22:07.253
Yes, she did. And she
was gonna tell you.

22:07.255 --> 22:09.091
Well, I didn't know.

22:09.094 --> 22:11.124
Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's
because you were too busy

22:11.126 --> 22:13.092
messing up Alex's life,
'cause you a player.

22:13.094 --> 22:14.594
- That's what players do.
- Okay, I didn't

22:14.596 --> 22:17.096
play anybody, all right?
Star backed off from me.

22:17.106 --> 22:19.907
So I let her go. But
that's what she wanted.

22:21.035 --> 22:23.005
And-and what me and Alex have...

22:23.008 --> 22:24.513
You and Alex what?

22:24.516 --> 22:26.583
We just got something.

22:26.586 --> 22:30.655
Yo, so you got feelings
for the both of 'em.

22:30.658 --> 22:32.721
That's real messed up.

22:32.724 --> 22:36.138
Look, I know you're a superstar
and all, and we're crashing.

22:36.141 --> 22:38.316
So right now's not the best
time to be creeping around.

22:38.319 --> 22:40.361
Crashing? What... Maurice
just released your record

22:40.364 --> 22:42.188
to the radio. What are
you talking about?

22:42.190 --> 22:44.323
But we ain't got no radio play.

22:44.325 --> 22:46.759
Yo, this ain't a game to us.

22:46.761 --> 22:49.162
Tonight is all we got.

22:49.164 --> 22:52.398
So stay the hell away
from Alex and Star,

22:52.400 --> 22:54.467
so nobody gets hurt.

22:54.469 --> 22:56.836
Got it?

22:56.839 --> 22:58.583
Men are trash.

23:10.435 --> 23:13.319
Since you won't let me
tear this bitch down,

23:13.321 --> 23:16.756
the least I could do is
help you clean it up.

23:16.758 --> 23:18.349
I don't need help. I got it.

23:18.352 --> 23:22.432
Aw, you always did have
such thick, pretty hair.

23:22.435 --> 23:23.611
But...

23:23.614 --> 23:24.989
I knew there was a "but."

23:24.992 --> 23:26.498
But why do you hide it?

23:26.501 --> 23:30.103
Why do you always
wear those ugly wigs?

23:30.105 --> 23:32.510
It's not like I'm
hiding something, Ma.

23:32.513 --> 23:34.073
My wigs are my style.

23:34.075 --> 23:36.661
Your style? You
ain't got no style.

23:36.664 --> 23:38.854
When's the last time you
talked to your daughter?

23:38.857 --> 23:40.947
Actually, we talk
a lot more now.

23:40.949 --> 23:43.182
- We good.
- You sure?

23:43.184 --> 23:45.485
Ma, don't come up in
here, starting no mess.

23:45.487 --> 23:48.388
And stop acting like you know
Cotton better than I do.

23:48.391 --> 23:50.022
Well, I sure knew her
better when you didn't know

23:50.024 --> 23:51.624
if she was a boy
or girl, didn't I?

23:51.626 --> 23:53.159
And you ain't never
gonna let me forget it.

23:53.161 --> 23:56.129
You got that right.

23:56.131 --> 23:58.431
All you need to know
about my daughter

23:58.433 --> 24:00.233
is that I got her.

24:00.235 --> 24:03.536
And I'm a better mother to her
than you ever were to me.

24:03.538 --> 24:05.171
Who you talking to, heifer?!

24:11.412 --> 24:14.046
You good?

24:14.048 --> 24:16.849
No. But I can sing backup.

24:16.851 --> 24:19.218
There's radio people
out there tonight.

24:19.220 --> 24:21.788
It's the whole reason for this.
We got to pop.

24:21.790 --> 24:23.817
- I know you can do it.
- Pop.

24:27.028 --> 24:30.296
What you still doing? Let's go.
It's time to sing.

24:30.298 --> 24:32.330
Mm. GiGi's song.

24:32.333 --> 24:35.034
This... this beat is different.

24:35.036 --> 24:36.402
We still got to sing the song.

24:36.404 --> 24:37.837
As long as the melody's
the same, let's...

24:37.839 --> 24:40.177
No. No, we're not
singing this song.

24:40.180 --> 24:41.641
You're trippin'.
We're singing it.

24:41.643 --> 24:43.442
We're not, okay?

24:43.444 --> 24:46.263
The hook is plagiarized.

24:46.266 --> 24:47.732
♪ Banana nana fah fana... ♪

24:47.735 --> 24:49.651
- Yo, Alex, wait up.
- Yo, I need to holla at you.

24:49.653 --> 24:51.825
Hey, girl. You ready
to kill it tonight?

24:51.828 --> 24:54.411
Did you hear the new track?
Dope, right?

24:54.414 --> 24:56.114
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, real dope.

24:56.117 --> 24:58.523
I didn't know you were sampling
a hook from Lil' Rage.

24:58.526 --> 25:00.126
I'm not.

25:00.128 --> 25:03.462
The new hook you just put on
"Bossy" is the exact same.

25:03.464 --> 25:05.331
Well, yeah, I know.

25:05.333 --> 25:06.999
You know?

25:07.001 --> 25:09.235
Girl, are you serious?

25:09.237 --> 25:12.772
Can't you see I'm
busy right now?

25:12.774 --> 25:15.241
You just plagiarized it and
you think that's okay?

25:15.243 --> 25:16.709
"You straight-up plagiarized it

25:16.711 --> 25:18.447
and you think that's okay?"

25:18.450 --> 25:20.413
Girl, you grew up
in the industry.

25:20.415 --> 25:22.927
You know how it works.
Why you trippin'?

25:22.930 --> 25:25.417
This whole damn industry is
built off of people boosting

25:25.420 --> 25:27.354
from each other. I'm
doing you a solid, girl,

25:27.357 --> 25:29.604
- not the other way around.
- I'm so sorry, GiGi.

25:29.607 --> 25:31.824
I don't know what came over her.
She probably drunk.

25:31.826 --> 25:34.716
Or too caught up in Noah's
ass to be thinking straight.

25:34.719 --> 25:36.762
You're supposed to be
smarter than that.

25:51.891 --> 25:54.544
I know you lost Elliot.

25:54.546 --> 25:57.847
And that pain don't
just go away.

25:57.850 --> 25:59.983
How you hangin'?

26:08.259 --> 26:10.422
Why is my crazy-ass
mother telling me

26:10.425 --> 26:13.129
there's something
wrong with you?

26:13.132 --> 26:15.992
What happened the
night of the fire?

26:19.838 --> 26:23.106
911. What is your emergency?

26:23.108 --> 26:25.594
Hello? Is anyone there?

26:25.597 --> 26:27.831
I know Omari killed Elliot.

26:27.834 --> 26:29.445
Did he threaten you?

26:30.281 --> 26:31.681
Do not scream.

26:31.683 --> 26:33.282
I'm gonna continue

26:33.284 --> 26:35.618
to take people away from you

26:35.620 --> 26:37.680
until you give me what I want.

26:39.924 --> 26:42.592
Omari's not why I'm sad, Mama.

26:42.594 --> 26:44.260
It's Elliot.

26:44.262 --> 26:46.162
I promise.

26:46.164 --> 26:48.164
<i>So you our manager now?</i>

26:48.167 --> 26:49.868
Just calling shots like
our votes don't count?

26:49.870 --> 26:52.034
You, out of all people, are
saying this to me right now?

26:52.036 --> 26:53.836
You cannot seriously think
we're about to debut

26:53.838 --> 26:55.037
- a dirty song.
- I seriously

26:55.039 --> 26:56.772
think we can do
whatever it takes.

26:56.774 --> 26:58.508
And that's what it
takes right now.

26:58.510 --> 27:00.710
But you don't care about that,
as long as it doesn't interrupt

27:00.712 --> 27:03.091
your little glow-up. I'm
sorry, I mean Derek...

27:03.094 --> 27:05.250
Oh, not Derek. Noah's glow-up.

27:05.253 --> 27:07.789
It's a lie, okay? It's cheating.

27:07.792 --> 27:10.508
You, of all people, are
talking to me about cheating?

27:10.511 --> 27:12.633
- Star, don't.
- That's none of your business.

27:12.636 --> 27:15.364
- Okay, let's do this, Alex.
- No.

27:15.367 --> 27:17.092
Let's have this conversation.

27:17.095 --> 27:19.829
♪ I would buy if
you sell that... ♪

27:19.831 --> 27:21.664
You cannot just
walk away from me.

27:21.666 --> 27:24.000
You made this my business when
you let it affect the group.

27:24.002 --> 27:25.902
You knew this was a
fake relationship.

27:25.904 --> 27:28.404
- Fake?
- Yes, fake.

27:28.406 --> 27:31.110
From where I was standing,
that kiss looked pretty real.

27:31.113 --> 27:32.780
You gonna stand here and tell me

27:32.783 --> 27:36.141
that you didn't have something
with him before that showcase?

27:36.144 --> 27:37.877
I didn't.

27:40.985 --> 27:42.985
But I wanted to.

27:42.988 --> 27:46.172
Might as well just
tell you guys now.

27:48.866 --> 27:51.793
Derek didn't break up with
me because of that kiss.

27:51.796 --> 27:54.463
What are you talking about?

27:54.465 --> 27:57.466
Noah and I...

27:57.468 --> 27:59.656
after the show, we...

28:01.648 --> 28:03.348
we almost had sex.

28:06.399 --> 28:08.110
And you call me a whore.

28:08.112 --> 28:09.860
Your man's in a wheelchair

28:09.863 --> 28:12.048
- and you're getting it from Noah.
- I just said "almost."

28:12.050 --> 28:13.816
Just like how you almost
slept with my dad.

28:13.818 --> 28:14.661
Oh, my God.

28:14.673 --> 28:15.528
I'm trying to tell you
the truth right now,

28:15.530 --> 28:16.697
and you're judging me on this?

28:16.699 --> 28:18.672
'Cause I was there first, Alex.

28:18.675 --> 28:20.742
Ooh, finally.

28:22.594 --> 28:24.424
Fir... Where first?

28:24.427 --> 28:26.594
I was with Noah first.

28:26.597 --> 28:29.631
Before this fake relationship
ever even started.

28:29.634 --> 28:32.001
How long?

28:32.003 --> 28:33.936
A couple of months.

28:33.938 --> 28:37.190
We were gonna break it
off before the showcase,

28:37.193 --> 28:39.193
and I was pushing him away.

28:39.196 --> 28:41.443
I didn't want to.

28:41.446 --> 28:43.377
And I was gonna tell him.

28:52.223 --> 28:54.223
What's up, y'all?

28:54.225 --> 28:57.326
Just dropped this three
days ago, and, um,

28:57.328 --> 28:59.515
this will be the first
live performance.

28:59.518 --> 29:02.098

31:51.755 --> 31:54.384
I was just confused.

31:56.693 --> 32:00.394
And so much has
happened this year.

32:05.602 --> 32:08.869
Derek, I had an abortion.

32:08.871 --> 32:10.884
Not a miscarriage.

32:14.077 --> 32:17.211
I knew you'd be mad
that I lied to you.

32:17.213 --> 32:19.714
I think that's why
I was stealing.

32:19.716 --> 32:22.717
I felt like my life was
spinning out of control,

32:22.720 --> 32:25.548
- and stealing gave me control.
- Stop.

32:25.551 --> 32:27.696
I wasn't myself anymore.

32:31.294 --> 32:34.532
And that pushed me
further away from you.

32:36.454 --> 32:38.282
And then Noah came.

32:45.093 --> 32:47.660
I'm so sorry.

32:47.663 --> 32:50.944
I would have understood.

32:50.947 --> 32:53.481
What I don't understand
is how you've...

32:53.483 --> 32:55.850
you've been lying to me
since the day we met.

32:55.852 --> 32:59.053
- I know.
- Do you?

32:59.055 --> 33:02.356
Noah ain't got nothing
to do with any of this.

33:02.358 --> 33:04.692
You're feeling him?

33:04.695 --> 33:08.230
Why don't you just be honest?
Stop using me as an excuse.

33:14.637 --> 33:16.370
My bad. I can come back.

33:18.975 --> 33:20.681
No, we're done.

33:34.323 --> 33:37.124
What's all this?

33:37.126 --> 33:39.193
It's the last of my stuff.

33:39.195 --> 33:42.363
It's over.

33:58.881 --> 34:02.450
Um, I'm gonna go put
these in the house.

34:04.353 --> 34:05.686
All right.

34:05.688 --> 34:07.088
Thanks.

34:07.090 --> 34:10.091
Tell Carlotta we'll
be in in a minute.

34:10.092 --> 34:11.610
All right.

34:23.940 --> 34:27.141
You know, sitting out here is
not gonna make it less real.

34:27.143 --> 34:30.177
Y-You don't get it.

34:30.179 --> 34:32.980
You never lost
someone like this.

34:32.982 --> 34:34.579
And don't you dare say Hunter,

34:34.581 --> 34:36.054
because Karen's nothing
like his sorry ass.

34:36.065 --> 34:37.550
Oh, I know.

34:37.553 --> 34:39.920
Yeah, you were caught up
in all this stupid drama.

34:39.922 --> 34:42.045
It was like she was just
some random street kid

34:42.047 --> 34:43.524
that no one cared about.

34:43.525 --> 34:46.527
Like her life didn't matter.

34:46.529 --> 34:48.868
But I loved her.

34:48.871 --> 34:50.501
I know.

34:53.202 --> 34:55.168
I'm sorry I didn't know her.

34:55.170 --> 34:58.773
It's okay.

34:58.775 --> 35:01.575
'Cause I did.

35:01.577 --> 35:05.112
You know, I felt like I
saw Mama that night.

35:05.114 --> 35:07.564
When the paramedics
were taking Karen away,

35:07.567 --> 35:10.068
<i>it was like Mama
dying al over again.</i>

35:10.079 --> 35:13.228
And for a second, I
thought it was...

35:15.824 --> 35:17.924
I thought you were
under the sheet.

35:17.927 --> 35:21.729
But I've been thinking a
lot about Mama lately.

35:21.731 --> 35:25.065
What I'm saying is, you
deal how you deal.

35:25.067 --> 35:27.434
And we'll be okay.

35:27.436 --> 35:29.876
Am I a lesbian now?

35:32.341 --> 35:35.376
Am I a lesbian?

35:35.378 --> 35:38.245
I don't know. How would I know?

35:38.247 --> 35:40.214
But I hate labels.

35:40.216 --> 35:42.938
- I know. Okay.
- It don't matter.

35:46.255 --> 35:48.712
What's up, Miss C?

35:48.715 --> 35:51.678
Maurice told me
that Charles Floyd

35:51.681 --> 35:53.214
is taking over the label.

35:53.217 --> 35:54.943
That's a good thing, right?

35:54.946 --> 35:57.331
I mean, anything's
better than Ayanna.

35:57.333 --> 36:00.634
- Just don't sleep with him.
- Who, Charles Floyd?

36:00.636 --> 36:03.437
- What is he, like, 70?
- Ew.

36:03.439 --> 36:06.540
- I have a very specific cutoff.
- Oh, God.

36:06.542 --> 36:09.410
Listen, this could be a
clean slate for y'all.

36:09.412 --> 36:11.478
I mean, Ayanna was
trying to prove herself,

36:11.480 --> 36:14.181
but Charles, we already
know what he can do.

36:14.183 --> 36:16.790
He's a star-maker.

36:16.793 --> 36:20.428
You play your cards right and
your ship could be coming in.

36:20.431 --> 36:24.860
The question is: are
y'all ready to get on?

36:26.969 --> 36:28.787
Why-why is that
hand there again?

36:28.790 --> 36:30.830
Because she's not gonna
let go of this thing.

36:30.833 --> 36:33.243
- Let's just do it for her. Yes.
- All right, fine.

36:33.246 --> 36:34.969
- Oh.
- She's not gonna stop.

36:36.340 --> 36:38.741
Yes! Come on, let's go.

36:38.744 --> 36:43.346
But tonight, we got to say
good-bye to somebody special.

36:45.481 --> 36:47.224
Please tell me you
talked to your uncle.

36:47.227 --> 36:49.678
No, man. I wouldn't
hold your breath.

36:49.681 --> 36:52.353
You know he likes to make a lot
of promises he can't keep.

36:52.355 --> 36:53.888
Turn on the radio.

36:53.890 --> 36:55.368
What?

36:55.371 --> 36:57.298
He has risen indeed.

36:57.301 --> 36:59.259
Who the hell let you
out the hospital?

36:59.262 --> 37:00.845
I made nice with a
few of the nurses.

37:00.848 --> 37:03.997
Now, turn on the radio, or
you're gonna miss your track.

37:04.000 --> 37:07.102
- Hey, what are you talking about?
- I paid for 500 spins,

37:07.105 --> 37:09.538
which means I just put you
both into the big leagues.

37:09.541 --> 37:11.321
I mean, 500 spins is
barely the big leagues.

37:11.324 --> 37:12.939
Oh, you been on
the radio before?

37:12.942 --> 37:14.857

a plan of your own?

37:24.553 --> 37:26.921
'Cause let me tell you something
right now, Charles Floyd,

37:26.923 --> 37:30.048
if he does decide to sell this
label, this means insurance.

37:30.051 --> 37:32.292
It gives you the chance
to land somewhere else.

37:32.295 --> 37:35.029
You're welcome.

37:35.031 --> 37:36.095
It's on the radio.

37:36.098 --> 37:38.049
- It's your last second chance, man.
- Well, look, I hate

37:38.051 --> 37:39.667
to be a dick about it,
nephew, but I'm gonna take

37:39.669 --> 37:41.381
as many second
chances as I want.

37:41.384 --> 37:43.170

I got you signed

contract, and you, too.

the ride, huh?

just want to drink.

38:20.209 --> 38:22.710
Ooh. Nasty.

38:25.348 --> 38:26.981
Mm. Ain't yours, anyway.

38:26.984 --> 38:28.615
Whatever.

38:28.617 --> 38:30.484
You know Ronnie Lawson died.

38:30.486 --> 38:32.786
- What?
- Yeah.

38:32.788 --> 38:34.778
How?

38:34.781 --> 38:36.590
They say it was lung infection,

38:36.592 --> 38:38.625
but, you know, I
think it was AIDS.

38:38.627 --> 38:41.428
Mm, mm, mm.

38:41.430 --> 38:46.166
Y'all used to get lit after
every service on Sunday.

38:47.803 --> 38:49.303
That was my baby.

That was <i>my</i> baby.
He was <i>my</i> crush.

38:51.323 --> 38:53.957
Yeah, he was mine, too. Hmm.

38:53.960 --> 38:56.242

38:56.245 --> 38:59.680
Bitch, there you go with that
crazy imagination of yours.

38:59.682 --> 39:02.047
- I never slept with Ronnie Lawson.
- Mm-hmm.

39:02.050 --> 39:03.950
- That's what he said.
- Then he's a liar.

39:03.953 --> 39:06.047
- He the one that told me that.
- God rest his soul.

39:06.050 --> 39:07.917
- 'Cause he was a liar.
- He was.

39:07.920 --> 39:09.519
Lyin' ass.

39:09.522 --> 39:11.984
He used to get away with
it with them green eyes.

39:11.987 --> 39:13.219
Okay.

39:13.222 --> 39:15.859
Aw, God bless his fine ass.

39:15.862 --> 39:17.862
Yeah.

39:20.002 --> 39:22.007
What happened to us, Cass?

39:24.600 --> 39:26.767
You want to go there?

39:26.770 --> 39:28.836
You picked a side.

39:28.839 --> 39:30.778
You wanted to be legit,

39:30.780 --> 39:33.680
and there ain't no legit
bone in your body, Carlotta.

39:33.682 --> 39:35.482
There's not.

39:35.484 --> 39:37.825
- I picked survival.
- No, you don't know me.

39:37.828 --> 39:39.390
I know you a lot.
And it was easier,

39:39.400 --> 39:40.992
because Mama always
liked you better.

39:40.995 --> 39:42.695
Well, you got the singing voice.

39:42.698 --> 39:44.464
Oh, hey, Mama.

39:46.094 --> 39:48.494

back in your purse.

Mama, I'm the one that needs it.

40:01.325 --> 40:03.054
Oh, my God.

40:10.118 --> 40:12.652
Is this why you called
your grandmother here?

40:12.655 --> 40:14.421
You thought I
couldn't protect you?

40:14.423 --> 40:16.445
- I didn't want you to.
- Why?

40:16.448 --> 40:19.437
Because you shot his ass and
he still ain't scared of you.

40:19.440 --> 40:21.140
He says he's gonna
kill you, Mama.

40:21.143 --> 40:23.463

Cassie take care of it.
