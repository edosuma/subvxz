02:16.370 --> 02:17.712
IT'S KINDERGARTEN, THOUGH.

02:17.750 --> 02:19.752
THEY'RE GONNA PLAY
WITH BLOCKS, RIGHT?

02:19.790 --> 02:22.588
- [scoffs] YEAH. IT'S NOT
YOUR MOM'S KINDERGARTEN.

02:22.620 --> 02:25.032
THOSE KIDS
ARE READING ALREADY.

02:25.070 --> 02:26.173
AND THE LONGER WE WAIT,

02:26.210 --> 02:28.587
THE MORE THE OTHER KIDS
WILL FORM BONDS WITHOUT HIM.

02:28.630 --> 02:29.619
- WELL, WHAT ABOUT
YOUR MOM'S DISTRICT?

02:29.660 --> 02:31.036
DIDN'T YOU SAY
THAT WAS DECENT?

02:31.080 --> 02:32.524

IT'S SO WARM IN HERE,
AND THEN YOU'RE OUT THERE.

02:42.360 --> 02:44.430
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
- I GOT SO MUCH TO DO.

02:44.470 --> 02:46.324
I MEAN, I HAVE TO FIND
A PLACE TO LIVE.

02:46.370 --> 02:47.678
I STILL NEED TO GET
BACK TO NEW YORK

02:47.710 --> 02:49.268
AND PACK UP THE APARTMENT
AT SOME POINT,

02:49.300 --> 02:51.188
AND I NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT I'M DOING FOR A LIVING

02:51.240 --> 02:52.264
NOW THAT I'M NOT TOURING.

02:52.310 --> 02:54.119

BUT THEY NEVER HAVE OPENINGS,

03:03.560 --> 03:05.721
AND THERE'S ALWAYS
A WAITING LIST.

03:05.770 --> 03:07.488
- I'LL TALK TO MY SISTER.

03:07.530 --> 03:09.009

05:48.900 --> 05:50.162
- WELL, THERE I HAVE
TO DISAGREE WITH YOU,

05:50.210 --> 05:52.929
BECAUSE GOING TO AN ASPERGER'S
SUPPORT GROUP WITH THE LESSINGS

05:52.970 --> 05:54.938

06:10.330 --> 06:12.127
I'M NOT GOIN'.
- [scoffs]

06:12.160 --> 06:13.741
ADAM!

06:13.780 --> 06:17.261
YOU'RE JUST KIDDING,

06:17.300 --> 06:19.541
I'LL TELL PHIL

06:19.580 --> 06:23.061
- NEVER IN MY WHOLE LIFE

06:23.100 --> 06:25.614

JUST ONE

06:25.660 --> 06:29.244
I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED

LIKE, DO A LITTLE STUDYING,

07:09.010 --> 07:11.001
MAYBE SMOKE
A LITTLE WEED AND--

07:11.050 --> 07:13.427
- DUDE, WE'RE NOT GONNA
SMOKE WEED...

07:13.460 --> 07:15.428
- IT'S--
- DURING OUR TUTORING SESSION.

07:15.460 --> 07:16.700
- IT'S ORGANIC.

07:16.740 --> 07:18.879
- OH, IT'S ORGANIC.

07:18.920 --> 07:20.638
- SYCAMORE

THEY DON'T NEED TO KNOW

07:30.580 --> 07:32.616
"I DIDN'T KNOW I HAD A SON"...
- OKAY.

07:32.650 --> 07:34.618
- "AND THEN I DECIDED
TO START DATING HIS MOTHER

07:34.660 --> 07:36.343
AFTER I FOUND OUT,"
AND WHATEVER.

07:36.380 --> 07:38.519
YOU AND JASMINE AREN'T MARRIED.
YOU DON'T EVEN LIVE TOGETHER.

07:38.560 --> 07:41.552
IT'S KIND OF...
IT JUST--IT JUST COMES OFF

07:41.590 --> 07:43.763
A LITTLE FLAKY.
- OKAY.

07:43.800 --> 07:46.496

PROBABLY ABOUT A YEAR.

11:38.800 --> 11:41.792
THERE WERE SIGNS BEFORE.

11:41.830 --> 11:44.799
HE WAS HAVING TROUBLE IN SCHOOL,

BEING AT HOME WITH ANTHONY,

12:18.490 --> 12:20.458
MY SIX-YEAR-OLD

I MEAN, MY HUSBAND LEAVES
FOR WORK AT 7:00 IN THE MORNING,

12:24.150 --> 12:29.770

WITH THESE...

12:46.900 --> 12:50.484
WEIRD RULES THAT DON'T APPLY

12:50.520 --> 12:53.523
YOU KNOW, THINKING--
THINKING ALL THE TIME...

12:53.560 --> 12:55.357
"IS THIS GONNA SET HIM OFF?
WHAT'S THAT NOISE?

12:55.390 --> 12:57.119
"S-SHOULD I DRIVE HOME
A DIFFERENT WAY

12:57.150 --> 12:59.186
TO AVOID THE BARKING DOG?"

12:59.220 --> 13:03.771
ALWAYS LIVING WITH THAT--
THAT PRESSURE, ALWAYS SO MUCH.

13:03.810 --> 13:06.370
AND IT FEELS LIKE
YOU CAN'T BREATHE SOMETIMES.

16:19.210 --> 16:21.007
- GOOD TO KNOW...
ZEEK.

16:21.040 --> 16:23.076
- AND, UH, TONY.
- MM-HMM.

16:23.120 --> 16:24.769
- LET'S GET SOMETHING
STRAIGHT BETWEEN US,

16:24.810 --> 16:25.947
SO TO SPEAK.

16:25.980 --> 16:29.529
I'LL BE LEADING.
- YOU'RE THE BOSS, ZEEK.

16:33.540 --> 16:35.053
- OKAY.

16:45.550 --> 16:47.165
HMM.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.309
WELL, THIS ISN'T
YOUR FIRST CLASS, IS IT?

16:51.350 --> 16:52.624
- NOPE.

16:56.530 --> 16:57.519
- VERY NICE.

17:02.020 --> 17:05.012
HEY, MILLIE.

17:05.050 --> 17:06.256
LOOK AT TONY.

17:06.300 --> 17:08.461
I MEAN, GOSH,
HE'S SO RESPONSIVE.

17:08.510 --> 17:09.841
HUH?

17:09.890 --> 17:11.266
MOVES LIKE A DREAM,
DOESN'T HE?

17:11.300 --> 17:14.337
VERY NICE.
YEAH.

17:17.380 --> 17:19.644
VERY COORDINATED.
YOU DIP?

17:19.690 --> 17:21.237
- OH, YEAH.

17:23.070 --> 17:24.719
[music ends, applause]
- NICELY DONE!

17:26.210 --> 17:29.338
- MOMMY, I HAD
ANOTHER NIGHTMARE.

18:06.700 --> 18:08.383
- HEY.

18:08.430 --> 18:10.637
- HEY.

18:10.670 --> 18:11.489
- COME BACK TO BED.

18:11.530 --> 18:13.157
- SHE HAS TO GET
OUT OF THAT BED.

18:13.190 --> 18:15.909
- THAT'S A LITTLE INTENSE.
- I FEEL INTENSE.

18:15.950 --> 18:17.815
- OKAY, SHE CAN SLEEP
ON MY SIDE OF THE BED, OKAY?

18:17.850 --> 18:20.910
- NO, SWEETHEART, IT'S NOT
ABOUT WHICH SIDE SHE SLEEPS ON.

18:20.960 --> 18:22.507
IT'S ABOUT...

18:22.540 --> 18:24.644
IT'S ABOUT ME BEING A PARENT.

18:24.680 --> 18:27.990
YOU GO TO WORK,
AND I'M A PARENT ALL DAY.

18:28.030 --> 18:29.133
YOU KNOW?

18:29.170 --> 18:31.343
AND THEN YOU GET HOME,
AND IT'S ALL ABOUT OUR GIRL,

18:31.380 --> 18:33.132
WHICH IT SHOULD BE,
AND I LOVE IT,

18:33.180 --> 18:36.001
BUT AT NIGHT...
[laughs]

18:36.040 --> 18:37.348
AT NIGHT,
IT'S THE ONLY TIME

18:37.390 --> 18:40.518
THAT I DON'T HAVE TO BE
A PARENT.

18:40.560 --> 18:42.937
I CAN JUST BE JOEL
WITH MY WIFE,

18:42.980 --> 18:45.972
AND I NEED THAT.

18:46.020 --> 18:48.113
- [softly]
I'M SORRY.

18:48.160 --> 18:50.492
I WANT TO BE WITH YOU TOO.

18:50.540 --> 18:53.156
BUT I DO GO TO WORK
IN THE MORNING,

18:53.200 --> 18:54.576
AND I--
AND I WORK ALL DAY,

18:54.610 --> 18:57.090
AND I MISS HER SO MUCH
WHILE I'M THERE, AND...

18:57.130 --> 19:00.054
YOU KNOW,
I LOVE MY JOB, BUT...

19:00.100 --> 19:02.989
SHE'S GROWING UP SO FAST.

19:03.030 --> 19:04.167
I DON'T WANT
TO MISS IT ALL.

19:04.210 --> 19:07.304
SOMETIMES THAT'S THE ONLY TIME
I GET TO BE A PARENT.

19:07.350 --> 19:11.480
- MOMMY, COME BACK.
I NEED YOU.

19:11.520 --> 19:12.760
- [sighs]

19:22.360 --> 19:23.987
- HONEY?
- YEAH?

19:24.020 --> 19:26.056
- CAN I TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING

19:26.090 --> 19:30.299
THAT'S PROBABLY
GONNA ANNOY YOU?

19:30.340 --> 19:32.717
- PLEASE, BY ALL MEANS.

19:35.270 --> 19:38.512
- THAT SUPPORT GROUP
ISN'T AS SCARY AS IT SOUNDS.

19:38.550 --> 19:40.996
I THINK IT'S HELPFUL.
- ALL RIGHT, KRISTINA--

19:41.040 --> 19:42.587
- IT COULD BE
HELPFUL TO YOU.

19:42.620 --> 19:43.894
- LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING
TO YOU.

19:43.940 --> 19:46.727
I DON'T THINK
THAT IT'S SCARY.

19:46.770 --> 19:49.796
I THINK IT'S STUPID.

19:49.840 --> 19:51.728
- [sighs]

19:53.740 --> 19:56.595
- YOU KNOW...I HAVE YOU.

19:56.640 --> 19:58.255
- MM-HMM.

19:58.300 --> 20:00.052
- WE HAVE EACH OTHER.

20:00.090 --> 20:02.957
I CAN TALK
ABOUT ANYTHING WITH YOU,

20:02.990 --> 20:05.265
AND THAT'S ENOUGH FOR ME.
- OKAY.

20:05.300 --> 20:08.098
- YOU'LL BE MY GROUP.
- [glggleSJ

20:08.130 --> 20:09.779
- I LOVE YOU.
- MM.

20:12.100 --> 20:13.749
GOOD NIGHT.

20:13.790 --> 20:15.724
- GOOD NIGHT.

20:21.560 --> 20:23.869
I'M GONNA KEEP GOING,
THOUGH.

20:28.570 --> 20:30.879
- FINE.
I THINK YOU SHOULD.

20:35.230 --> 20:37.676
- OKAY.

20:47.140 --> 20:49.961
[background chatter]

21:01.700 --> 21:03.395
- READY?
- [gasps] OH, THANKS.

21:03.430 --> 21:05.284
I MEAN, HI.
YES.

21:05.330 --> 21:06.729
LET'S--

21:06.780 --> 21:08.532
- OKAY.

21:08.570 --> 21:10.367
- WOW.
I-I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

21:10.400 --> 21:12.914
THIS THING KEEPS GETTING BIGGER
AND BIGGER EVERY YEAR.

21:12.960 --> 21:14.643
- OH.

21:15.750 --> 21:17.889
- SO HOW LONG
HAVE YOU GUYS BEEN DOING THIS?

21:17.930 --> 21:21.331
- WELL, WE'VE BEEN DRAGGING OUR
ASSES THERE FOR EIGHT WEEKS NOW,

21:21.380 --> 21:22.995
AT 150 BUCKS A SESSION.

21:23.040 --> 21:24.348
- YEAH.

21:24.380 --> 21:26.689
ADAM, THESE ARE--
THESE ARE TOO TIGHT IN HERE.

21:26.730 --> 21:28.174
I DON'T THINK
THEY'RE MADE RIGHT.

21:28.210 --> 21:29.245
- YEAH, THEY'RE NOT
MADE RIGHT.

21:29.280 --> 21:30.690
DAD, YOU HAVE A WIDE FOOT.
I'VE TOLD YOU THAT.

21:30.730 --> 21:33.176

21:37.840 --> 21:38.772
- YEP.

21:38.810 --> 21:42.530
YOU JUST TALK? SHARE?
- HELL IF I KNOW.

21:42.570 --> 21:44.504
I KNOW THAT THE ONLY THING
I'M DOING DIFFERENTLY

21:44.540 --> 21:47.361
IS I'M DANCING
WITH GAY TONY.

21:47.400 --> 21:49.288
OH, YOU OUGHT TO SEE
THIS GUY MOVE, ADAM.

21:49.340 --> 21:52.025
HE'S LIKE A FINELY TUNED
EUROPEAN SPORTS CAR.

21:52.060 --> 21:53.880
HE'S VERY SENSITIVE,

21:53.930 --> 21:56.899
AND HE JUST RESPONDS
TO THE SLIGHTEST TOUCH.

21:56.930 --> 21:59.444
HONESTLY, IT'S AMAZING.

22:01.380 --> 22:03.200
- THAT'S GREAT.
- HEY, SON,

22:03.250 --> 22:04.387
YOU KNOW...

22:04.420 --> 22:07.241

FOR ME, YOU KNOW?

22:07.290 --> 22:08.382
WHAT AM I GONNA GET
OUT OF IT?

22:08.430 --> 22:09.977
I HATE GOIN'.
- YEAH.

22:10.010 --> 22:13.559
- I'M GOING BECAUSE IT MEANS
SOMETHING TO YOUR MOM, RIGHT?

22:13.600 --> 22:15.875
THAT'S WHY I'M GOING.

22:19.680 --> 22:21.329

FROM PRAGUE,

22:45.010 --> 22:47.592
SO DON'T MENTION
YOUR RECENT TRIP THERE.

22:50.540 --> 22:52.462

I'LL LIGHT SOME CANDLES

ADDING ANOTHER LAYER TO THIS.

25:23.930 --> 25:24.897
WE CAN'T JUST...

25:24.930 --> 25:26.579

25:49.780 --> 25:51.168
WE GOT TO BE THECOUPLE,

25:51.200 --> 25:53.885
WE CAN'T JUST GO IN THERE
ALL FREE-SPIRITED BOHEMIAN

25:53.930 --> 25:55.306
AND THINK THEY'RE GONNA

25:55.340 --> 25:57.683
SO JUST POP THIS ON--

25:57.720 --> 25:58.789

AND WE'RE EXACTLY
THE KIND OF COUPLE

26:06.080 --> 26:08.219
THAT THEY WANT AT THIS SCHOOL
AS PARENTS.

26:08.250 --> 26:09.410
YOU KNOW WHY?

26:09.460 --> 26:11.599
BECAUSE WE'RE BRIGHT.
WE'RE LOVING.

26:11.630 --> 26:14.633
WE'RE ETHICAL.
WE LOVE EACH OTHER.

26:14.670 --> 26:17.150

I SWEAR, WHEN YOU TASTE IT,
YOU ARE GOING TO DIE.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.308
- THAT WOULD BE SO GREAT.

26:32.340 --> 26:33.477
AND I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE

26:33.520 --> 26:36.171
THAT OUR GRANDMOTHERS
BOTH CAME FROM NORTHERN IOWA.

26:36.210 --> 26:37.723

AND THE SAME TOWN.

26:37.760 --> 26:40.149
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
TERRIFIC TALKING TO YOU BOTH.

26:40.180 --> 26:41.659
YOU'LL BE HEARING
FROM US SOON.

26:41.700 --> 26:42.769
- LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

26:42.800 --> 26:43.937
- BYE-BYE.
- PRINCIPAL TAYLOR.

26:43.980 --> 26:47.108

26:53.680 --> 26:54.635
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

26:54.680 --> 26:56.011

- WELL, NOW YOU WANT--

26:56.060 --> 26:58.642

26:58.680 --> 27:00.887
- JUST GIVE IT TO ME!
- SORRY.

27:00.920 --> 27:04.060
LEFT HAND, RIGHT?
- YEAH, LEFT HAND.

27:29.680 --> 27:30.817
- YEP.

27:30.850 --> 27:32.670
LOOKS LIKE A WONDERFUL BOY.

27:32.720 --> 27:33.709
YOU KNOW,
WHAT I REALLY LIKE

27:33.750 --> 27:36.878
IS THAT HE'S INTERESTED
IN MUSIC AND BASEBALL.

27:36.930 --> 27:39.546
- YEAH. AND READING--
HE LIKES THAT.

27:39.580 --> 27:40.899
- A WELL-ROUNDED KID.

27:40.930 --> 27:41.919
OKAY.

27:41.970 --> 27:46.248
SO WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
SOMETHING ABOUT YOU TWO?

27:46.280 --> 27:47.440
- WELL, UM,

27:47.490 --> 27:49.549
FOR STARTERS,
WE ARE MARRIED.

27:49.590 --> 27:50.659
- MM-HMM.

27:50.700 --> 27:53.282
- UM, HAPPILY MARRIED.
- WELL, THAT'S VERY NICE.

27:53.320 --> 27:54.457
[chuckling]

27:54.500 --> 27:56.639
[clears throat]
ANYTHING ELSE?

27:56.670 --> 27:58.285
- OH, I'M A DANCER.

27:58.330 --> 27:59.399
- OH.
- MM-HMM.

27:59.430 --> 28:01.910
- WELL, THAT'S EXCITING.
DO YOU MOVE AROUND A LOT?

28:01.950 --> 28:03.633
- [laughs]
- THAT'S--

28:03.680 --> 28:05.079
- THAT WAS FUNNY...

28:05.130 --> 28:07.291
BECAUSE
DANCERS MOVE AROUND A LOT

28:07.340 --> 28:08.841
WHEN THEY'RE DANCING.

28:08.890 --> 28:12.337
BUT SHE'S NOT, UM, EVER
REALLY AWAY FROM HOME,

28:12.380 --> 28:14.268
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE...

28:14.310 --> 28:15.231
I THINK THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
WHAT YOUR QUESTION--

28:15.270 --> 28:18.797
- RIGHT. I DECIDED
TO ONLY TAKE LOCAL JOBS.

28:18.830 --> 28:20.036
- OH. YOU'RE LUQIEE TO FIND THEM.

28:20.070 --> 28:21.753
- I MEAN, YOU MUST BE
VERY TALENTED.

28:21.800 --> 28:23.586
- SHE'S INCREDIBLY TALENTED.

28:23.630 --> 28:25.973
IN FACT, SHE JUST TURNED DOWN
ALVIN AILEY'S DANCE COMPANY

28:26.010 --> 28:26.977
SO SHE COULD BE...
- IS THAT SO?

28:27.010 --> 28:28.170
- CLOSER TO OUR SON.

28:28.220 --> 28:31.075
- THAT'S THE LEVEL OF TALENT
SHE HAS.

28:31.120 --> 28:33.771
- YEAH, AND HE'S...
REALLY TALENTED AS WELL.

28:33.810 --> 28:35.698
I MEAN, HE'S AN AMAZING
MUSIC PRODUCER.

28:35.740 --> 28:37.879
THIS ONE HERE.
- DON'T KNOW ABOUT AMAZING.

28:37.920 --> 28:39.012
- YOU'RE AMAZING, HONEY.

28:39.060 --> 28:40.129
- IT'S NICE TO SEE TWO PARENTS

28:40.160 --> 28:42.674
WHO BELIEVE IN EACH OTHER
SO MUCH.

28:42.720 --> 28:45.029
HA. HAVE TO SAY,
IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE.

28:45.060 --> 28:47.437
NOW, YOU SAID
YOU'RE A MUSIC PRODUCER.

28:47.480 --> 28:48.754
- UH-HUH.

28:48.790 --> 28:53.204
- WELL, WE COULD SURE USE YOU
AROUND HERE FOR THE SPRING SING.

28:53.240 --> 28:55.344
SEE, I-IT'S ALWAYS
BEEN A THOUGHT OF MINE

28:55.380 --> 28:58.008
THAT IF WE COULD RECORD
THE KIDS' CONCERT

28:58.040 --> 28:59.029
AND THEN SELL THE CDS,

28:59.080 --> 29:01.310
THAT COULD BE A VERY GOOD
FUNDRAISER FOR US.

29:01.360 --> 29:03.316
- THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.
- THAT'S A REALLY GOOD IDEA.

29:03.360 --> 29:05.737
YOU KNOW, I COULD
TOTALLY DO THAT FOR YOU.

29:05.770 --> 29:08.045
WHAT KIND OF EQUIPMENT
DO YOU HAVE?

29:08.090 --> 29:09.944
- YOU MEAN, UM,
RECORDING EQUIPMENT?

29:09.980 --> 29:11.561
- YEAH.
- [laughs]

29:11.610 --> 29:13.157
NONE.
- OH. OKAY.

29:13.190 --> 29:15.818
UH, WELL, WE COULD BRING
THE KIDS DOWN TO MY STUDIO,

29:15.850 --> 29:17.408
AND I COULD RECORD THEM THERE.

29:17.440 --> 29:18.850
OR, YOU KNOW, EVEN BETTER,

29:18.890 --> 29:20.369
IF SOME OF THE KIDS
ARE INTERESTED IN, LIKE,

29:20.410 --> 29:24.642
THE MIXING BOARD, I COULD ALSO
HELP THEM TO ENGINEER IT TOO.

29:24.690 --> 29:27.750
THAT IS, I WOULD SERIOUSLY
LOVE TO DO THAT.

29:27.800 --> 29:29.301
THAT WOULD BE
SO MUCH FUN FOR ME.

29:29.350 --> 29:30.897
- THEY WOULD LOVE THAT.

29:30.940 --> 29:32.510
I MEAN, FOR THEM TO GET
INTO A REAL STUDIO

29:32.560 --> 29:34.312
AND SEE ALL THE REAL MACHINES
AND EVERYTHING,

29:34.350 --> 29:37.831
THAT WOULD MAKE THEIR DAY.
- YEAH.

29:37.870 --> 29:39.280
I THINK IT'D MAKE
ALL OF OUR DAYS.

29:39.320 --> 29:41.072
- MM-HMM.
- YEAH.

29:42.950 --> 29:45.327
- OH, YEAH.

29:45.360 --> 29:46.918
COME ON.

29:46.950 --> 29:49.919
[You've Got a Hold on Me
begins]

29:49.960 --> 29:52.508
[snapping fingers]

29:52.540 --> 29:55.259
- YOU CAST A SPELL ON ME

29:55.310 --> 29:57.198
I WAS BLIND,
BUT NOW I SEE

29:57.240 --> 29:59.708
- MILLIE, MILLIE, MILLIE!

29:59.760 --> 30:01.796

BUT NOW I SEE

30:15.150 --> 30:17.425

[click, music stops]

30:17.470 --> 30:19.358
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

30:19.400 --> 30:23.507
- I DON'T WANT TO DO
THE DANCE-CLASS THING ANYMORE.

30:23.540 --> 30:25.292
- WHY?

30:25.340 --> 30:26.500
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

30:26.540 --> 30:29.338
- HONEY, WE'RE NOT VERY GOOD,
ALL RIGHT?

30:29.370 --> 30:31.190
SO I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW,
IF WE PRACTICE,

30:31.240 --> 30:33.891
WE'RE GONNA GET BETTER,
THEN WE'LL HAVE A LOT MORE FUN.

30:33.930 --> 30:37.172
- IT'S NOT ABOUT THE DANCING.
DON'T YA GET IT?

30:39.900 --> 30:43.279
I WANTED TO SPEND TIME
TOGETHER.

30:46.360 --> 30:49.454
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

30:49.500 --> 30:51.843
NOW YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK.

30:51.880 --> 30:54.257
RIGHT?

31:00.440 --> 31:04.024

31:17.970 --> 31:20.598
- YOUR GRANDMA LET ME IN.

31:22.460 --> 31:24.325

ALL PISSED OFF?

31:24.360 --> 31:27.568
- UM...
I WASN'T ALL PISSED OFF.

31:27.600 --> 31:29.909
I JUST WAS, LIKE, A LITTLE...

31:29.950 --> 31:31.747

31:32.640 --> 31:34.744

31:34.780 --> 31:37.192

31:37.240 --> 31:39.094

OF COURSE I'M NOT JEALOUS.

31:39.130 --> 31:41.303
PLEASE.

31:41.340 --> 31:42.329
TO FIGURE OUT...

31:42.380 --> 31:44.302
- LOOK, I DON'T THINK

31:44.350 --> 31:48.411
WHAT A HUGE DEAL $40

31:48.450 --> 31:51.385
AND...

31:51.420 --> 31:53.980
LIKE, I JUST CAN'T AFFORD
SITTING AROUND

31:54.010 --> 31:56.626

I NEED THAT TUTORING.

31:58.190 --> 32:00.329

THOSE S.A.T.s.

32:19.790 --> 32:22.031
- HOPE SO.

32:22.070 --> 32:23.651
- CAN I STAY FOR DINNER?

32:23.700 --> 32:25.452

32:25.490 --> 32:27.526
IF YOU MUST.

32:40.260 --> 32:42.319

32:45.790 --> 32:47.018
COMMON EXPERIENCE--

32:47.060 --> 32:48.687
SHARED COMMON INTEREST.

32:48.720 --> 32:50.096

IT'S OKAY.

35:50.320 --> 35:53.483

IT'S OKAY.

35:58.080 --> 36:01.527
- I-I FELT KIND OF, UH,
WEIRD LEAVING THE HOUSE TONIGHT,

36:01.570 --> 36:05.529
BECAUSE OUR SON ASKED
WHERE HIS MOTHER WAS.

36:05.570 --> 36:08.152
AND, UH...

36:13.550 --> 36:16.235
I DON'T LIKE TO LIE
TO MY KIDS.

36:16.270 --> 36:18.409
SO I WANTED TO TELL HIM
THAT HIS MOTHER WAS

36:18.450 --> 36:21.726
AT AN ASPERGER'S SUPPORT GROUP
MEETING, BUT...

36:27.590 --> 36:31.174
I COULDN'T, BECAUSE HE DOESN'T
KNOW HE HAS ASPERGER'S.

36:42.300 --> 36:44.700
AND I DREAD...

36:44.750 --> 36:47.958
THE DAY THAT I HAVE
TO TELL HIM HE DOES.

37:02.840 --> 37:04.102
- HE'S ASLEEP.

37:04.150 --> 37:06.380
[ice cubes clinking]

37:06.430 --> 37:08.113
- GIN AND TONIC.

37:17.850 --> 37:21.911
- I THINK THEY MIGHT EVEN NAME
THE GYMNASIUM AFTER US.

37:21.960 --> 37:24.508
- IT'S BECAUSE YOU KILLED IT.
YOU REALLY DID.

37:24.550 --> 37:28.134
- THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

37:28.170 --> 37:30.274

37:30.310 --> 37:32.995
WE KILLED IT.

37:38.220 --> 37:40.688
YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE TIME
YOU WERE GONE,

37:40.740 --> 37:44.562
I NEVER STOPPED HOPING
THAT WE'D ALL BE BACK TOGETHER.

37:44.600 --> 37:46.465
AND...

37:46.500 --> 37:49.048
THIS IS KIND OF
HOW I HOPED IT WOULD BE.

37:55.130 --> 37:57.052
AND...

38:12.870 --> 38:14.428
YOU'RE AWESOME.

38:21.920 --> 38:23.467
- YEAH. YOU TOO.

38:25.920 --> 38:28.502
- I SHOULD, UM...
- THESE ARE GOOD.

38:28.540 --> 38:30.019
- GIVE YOU BACK THIS RING
BEFORE YOU LOSE IT.

38:30.060 --> 38:32.540
- OH, YEAH, THANK YOU.
JULIA WILL KILL ME IF--

38:32.580 --> 38:34.195
DO YOU WANT TO--
- NO. YOU SHOULD--

38:34.240 --> 38:36.583
YOU SHOULD GIVE IT BACK.

38:43.350 --> 38:45.727
- NOW IT'S TIME FOR SLEEP.

38:47.180 --> 38:48.169
[Sydney talking softly]

38:48.220 --> 38:52.042
MAKE SURE THAT
THE ALLIGATOR DOESN'T BITE YOU.

38:52.080 --> 38:53.422
[giggIeSJ
I KNOW, MOM.

38:53.460 --> 38:56.258
NIGHT.
NIGHT, DARLING.

38:56.290 --> 38:58.224
[whispering indistinctly]

38:58.260 --> 39:00.228
- HI, SWEETIE.
- HI, MOMMY. SHH.

39:00.260 --> 39:01.431
DADDY'S SLEEPING.

39:01.470 --> 39:05.679
- [whispering] I SEE THAT.
- CAN I GO IN YOUR BED NOW?

39:05.720 --> 39:07.403
- WELL...

39:07.440 --> 39:09.920
COME HERE.

39:11.480 --> 39:13.926
SO YOU KNOW WHAT'S FUNNY?
- WHAT?

39:13.970 --> 39:17.178
- WHEN MOMMIES AND DADDIES
FIRST MEET

39:17.210 --> 39:19.895
AND THEY FALL IN LOVE,

39:19.940 --> 39:23.592
THEY GET IN THIS KIND OF
A LOVE BUBBLE.

39:23.630 --> 39:26.428
IT'S THEIR OWN
LITTLE WORLD.

39:26.460 --> 39:28.769
AND THEY'RE JUST IN THERE
WITH EACH OTHER.

39:28.810 --> 39:32.257
AND THEN...
BABIES COME.

39:32.300 --> 39:35.087
AND IT MAKES THEM
REALLY HAPPY.

39:35.130 --> 39:38.952
AND THEY WANT THE BABIES
TO COME IN THE BUBBLE WITH THEM.

39:38.990 --> 39:42.858
BUT THEY ONLY MADE THE BUBBLE
FOR TWO PEOPLE AT FIRST...

39:42.890 --> 39:45.893
SO IT GETS A LITTLE SQUISHY.
- BUT DOES IT GROW?

39:45.930 --> 39:50.583
- IT DOES GROW, BUT IT
TAKES TIME FOR IT TO GROW, SO...

39:50.620 --> 39:53.009
- SO THE DADDY'S
GETTING PUSHED OUT?

39:53.040 --> 39:54.587
- THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

39:54.630 --> 39:57.599
AND HE STARTS TO FEEL
A LITTLE LEFT OUT, YOU KNOW?

39:57.630 --> 40:01.839
HE MISSES SOME OF THAT
ATTENTION THAT HE USED TO GET.

40:01.880 --> 40:02.972
SO...

40:03.020 --> 40:05.227
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD HELP ME
OUT WITH THAT,

40:05.260 --> 40:07.911
BASICALLY BEING IN YOUR OWN BED
FOR A LITTLE BIT,

40:07.950 --> 40:10.839
SO DADDY CAN COME BACK
IN THE BUBBLE...

40:10.890 --> 40:13.358
FOR A LITTLE BIT?

40:13.410 --> 40:14.980
- SURE.

40:15.030 --> 40:16.304
[kiss]

40:16.340 --> 40:19.161
SOMETIMES DADDIES
ARE LIKE LITTLE BABIES

40:19.200 --> 40:22.419
WHO NEED ATTENTION TOO.

40:41.120 --> 40:43.816
- IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

40:45.850 --> 40:46.987
SAD...

40:47.030 --> 40:50.363
KIND OF LONELY.

40:50.410 --> 40:52.162
[grunts]

40:56.550 --> 40:59.132
IS THAT THE WAY YOU FEEL?

41:02.900 --> 41:04.595
- WELL, IT'S...

41:04.630 --> 41:06.837
IT'S THE WAY I'VE FELT
FOR A LITTLE WHILE...

41:06.870 --> 41:08.599
- OH...

41:11.390 --> 41:12.709
- I GUESS.

41:12.740 --> 41:15.015
- YEAH?

41:15.050 --> 41:18.224
HEY, KID.

41:18.260 --> 41:20.569
I LOVE YOU.

41:23.060 --> 41:25.540
BOTTOM LINE, OKAY?

41:25.580 --> 41:29.584
- ALWAYS LIKED THE DRAMA

41:29.620 --> 41:32.794
I ALWAYS LIKED A JOKE

41:32.830 --> 41:34.934
- AND I'M NOT GONNA
LOSE YOU.

41:34.970 --> 41:38.178
- I ALWAYS LIKED THE LAW
AND

41:38.210 --> 41:41.179
I ALWAYS LIKED
A SMOKE

41:41.220 --> 41:42.767
- GOT A JACK?

41:42.810 --> 41:45.210
- GO FISH, MY FRIEND.

41:47.150 --> 41:49.391
- JACK!

41:49.430 --> 41:51.876
- HOW ABOUT THAT?
- THIS...MAKES...

41:51.920 --> 41:55.390
ALL...FOUR.

41:55.440 --> 41:56.429
- ALL RIGHT, MOM.

41:56.470 --> 41:58.097
- GABY SAYS I HAVE TO

41:58.130 --> 42:00.951
ASK ANOTHER
FEELING QUESTION TODAY.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.639
SO HOW WAS
THAT GROUP MEETING

42:03.690 --> 42:05.749
OF PEOPLE
WITH SHARED INTERESTS

42:05.790 --> 42:10.102
AND EXPERIENCE WHO LIKE
PLAYING CARDS THAT YOU WENT TO?

42:10.140 --> 42:12.654
- IT WAS GOOD...

42:12.700 --> 42:14.588
REALLY GOOD.

42:14.630 --> 42:18.111
- IT'S
THE PRETTIEST GARDENIA

42:18.150 --> 42:20.971
- GOT ANY 3s?

42:21.020 --> 42:23.011
- GO FISH.
