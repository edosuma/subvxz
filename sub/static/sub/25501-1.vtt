21:35.660 --> 21:36.660

[Khaled] Listen to it.

21:37.980 --> 21:39.820

21:43.780 --> 21:44.820
My son.

[man] <i>In my whole life, I've never seen</i>
<i>so much destruction.</i>

21:55.020 --> 21:57.020
This is my son.

21:57.100 --> 21:59.180
[Khaled] Yeah, thank God.

21:59.260 --> 22:02.020
But, brother,
what's really the difference

22:02.100 --> 22:06.220
between my son
and another person's?

22:06.300 --> 22:12.780
Aren't they all innocent?
What's their sin, whoever it is?

22:13.700 --> 22:15.980
[Khaled] ISIS on the ground
and the Russian planes from above.

22:16.060 --> 22:18.260
Six buildings...

22:18.340 --> 22:20.740
[men continue speaking Arabic]

22:25.220 --> 22:26.780
I feel cold.

22:26.860 --> 22:28.380

22:46.260 --> 22:47.740
[Khaled] <i>There is no war here.</i>

22:55.780 --> 22:57.940

<i>how the situation can change.</i>

23:25.500 --> 23:26.740
[Mohammed] If this was in Syria,

23:26.820 --> 23:31.260
it would have been dropping
cluster bombs from that height.

23:31.340 --> 23:32.860
We see so many cluster bombs.

23:32.940 --> 23:34.540
[man] Really?

23:34.620 --> 23:39.380
It would not drop barrel bombs,
because they want to cause more harm.

23:41.700 --> 23:42.740
[man 1] There is a sound...

23:42.820 --> 23:47.540
We can now differentiate between the sound
of military and civilian aircraft.

23:47.620 --> 23:49.620
[man 2] Take shelter, hero!

23:49.700 --> 23:53.700
[laughing] Where would I take shelter
in this building?

23:53.780 --> 23:58.620
If a barrel bomb fell here,
it would destroy the whole building!

23:58.700 --> 24:03.100
My son is almost two years old.

24:03.180 --> 24:04.900
He knows all about the war planes.

24:06.140 --> 24:11.660
When planes fly over
and there's an air strike...

24:11.740 --> 24:15.340
my son jumps up on my lap and says,

24:15.420 --> 24:17.660
"Daddy, a bomb."

Him and two of his colleagues.

27:33.700 --> 27:36.380
They were able to pull one out.

27:36.460 --> 27:39.140
There were four

27:39.220 --> 27:42.660
They got one out,

It's better.

27:54.180 --> 27:56.900

27:56.980 --> 27:59.220
My brother was killed
five months ago.

27:59.300 --> 28:03.140
I had a training course

to open the Internet for me,

28:12.500 --> 28:14.220
