WEBVTT

00:06.589 --> 00:08.674
Energy takes on many forms.

00:08.967 --> 00:11.328
Example, what do we know
of acoustical energy?

00:11.428 --> 00:14.998
It was discovered by a famous
scientist, right? Wrong.

00:15.098 --> 00:17.125
We must give full credit
to an Italian tenor who,

00:17.225 --> 00:20.545
one night, was singing an aria
in a Milano pizza parlor.

00:20.645 --> 00:22.714
You all know the story,
how he hit a high note,

00:22.814 --> 00:26.760
and the sound waves shattered a
wine glass on the other side of the room.

00:26.860 --> 00:29.153
Watch me, and I will show you
acoustical energy at work.

01:26.753 --> 01:29.614
Proud are we of mighty Medfield

01:29.714 --> 01:32.742
Alma mater dear

01:32.842 --> 01:35.886
All your sons and daughters hail to thee

01:36.012 --> 01:38.748
Medfield College of Technology

01:38.848 --> 01:41.751
And while we hold your banner high
Rah, rah

01:41.851 --> 01:44.838
We shout your praises to the sky
Rah, rah

01:44.938 --> 01:48.216
For proud are we of mighty Medfield

01:48.316 --> 01:51.261
Loyally we cheer

01:51.361 --> 01:54.196
Medfield, Medfield Rah, rah, rah

01:54.322 --> 01:57.434
Our Alma mater dear

02:20.890 --> 02:22.333
Now...

02:22.433 --> 02:26.061
Your next assignment will be, uh...

02:28.356 --> 02:29.440
Oh, I forgot.

02:30.733 --> 02:33.110
There'll be no assignment.
See you next week.

02:50.920 --> 02:53.406
Here we are. The beginning of the end.

02:53.506 --> 02:56.409
Point of no return. The last mile.

02:56.509 --> 02:58.286
Now, Shelby.

02:58.386 --> 02:59.511
All right.

03:02.307 --> 03:04.959
"Of all sad words of tongue and pen,

03:05.059 --> 03:07.837
"the saddest are these,
'It might have been'."

03:07.937 --> 03:10.090
Shelby, you promised. Now, stop.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.800
Did I promise to stop loving you?

03:11.900 --> 03:14.511
Just open the door, and let me out.

03:14.611 --> 03:16.846
- Suppose he doesn't show up this time.
- He will.

03:16.946 --> 03:18.697
Oh, Reverend. How nice to see you.

03:19.115 --> 03:21.434
You must be getting
awfully tired of my wedding.

03:21.534 --> 03:23.978
Third time's the charm, they say.

03:24.078 --> 03:28.149
But I am glad that this time
you brought the bridegroom with you.

03:28.249 --> 03:30.276
At last we meet, Professor Brainard.

03:30.376 --> 03:33.738
Uh, no. This is Professor Ashton.
He's romance languages.

03:33.838 --> 03:36.199
Professor Brainard is physical chemistry.

03:36.299 --> 03:39.410
Oh, dear me.
I seem to have made a mistake.

03:39.510 --> 03:42.539
Not you, sir.
It's Miss Carlisle's mistake.

03:42.639 --> 03:45.439
In fact, I've just been trying to
talk her out of this hideous blunder.

03:46.100 --> 03:48.294
Shelby, you are speaking
of the man I love.

03:48.394 --> 03:51.214
Love, darling,
is a bouquet of fragrant hyacinths,

03:51.314 --> 03:53.007
not a beaker of heavy hydrogen.

03:53.107 --> 03:55.426
- Am I right, sir?
- I merely perform the service.

03:55.526 --> 03:57.527
I don't take sides.

03:58.238 --> 04:01.141
- Betsy!
- Well, well. Here comes the bride.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.017
- Reverend.
- Good evening, Professor.

04:03.117 --> 04:05.812
And Professor Ashton,
all the way from Rutland University.

04:05.912 --> 04:08.148
Aren't you on the wrong campus, Professor?

04:08.248 --> 04:09.928
Miss Carlisle was kind enough
to invite me.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.277
Yes, yes, I remember. Seems there was talk

04:12.377 --> 04:14.154
that you, too, were
a contender for Betsy's hand.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.838
Well, Rutland can't win them all,
eh, Professor?

04:17.130 --> 04:20.076
Oh, it was so sweet of you
to go to all this trouble.

04:20.176 --> 04:21.870
And for the third time too.

04:21.970 --> 04:24.090
Well, you know the old saying,
third time's the charm.

04:24.180 --> 04:25.915
That's exactly what I just said.

04:26.015 --> 04:28.935
Well, I'm sick and tired of having
a spinster for a secretary. That's all.

04:29.018 --> 04:31.538
I better go upstairs and change.
The guests will be coming soon.

04:31.854 --> 04:33.730
The bridegroom too, I hope.

04:33.982 --> 04:35.884
Don't worry. I've alerted his housekeeper.

04:35.984 --> 04:37.734
She'll see that he gets here.

04:43.658 --> 04:45.894
The ring is in

04:45.994 --> 04:48.503
Your right side pocket

04:53.209 --> 04:54.459
Professor!

04:54.919 --> 04:56.461
Professor Brainard!

05:05.555 --> 05:08.890
Square root of E minus C, alpha G

05:17.233 --> 05:19.735
No. No, don't stop.

05:20.778 --> 05:22.680
Don't stop. Keep going.

05:22.780 --> 05:25.115
Keep going. Please don't stop.

05:38.087 --> 05:40.047
- Not again.
- Professor!

05:40.340 --> 05:42.200
Bum-bum-ba-bum

05:42.300 --> 05:43.785
Time for you to get dressed!

05:43.885 --> 05:45.578
Just five more minutes, Mrs. Chatsworth.

05:45.678 --> 05:46.913
Just five more minutes.

05:47.013 --> 05:48.930
Merciful heavens, what are you doing?

05:49.849 --> 05:52.543
I'm trying to solve the secrets
of the universe, Mrs. Chatsworth,

05:52.643 --> 05:54.003
and failing...

05:54.103 --> 05:55.103
Failing miserably.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.507
Yes, well, you're stopping right now.
Do you know what time it is?

05:57.607 --> 05:59.676
You've been working here all afternoon.

05:59.776 --> 06:02.512
Mrs. Chatsworth,
I've been working for three long months.

06:02.612 --> 06:03.612
Pardon me.

06:03.654 --> 06:05.139
I've been working
on something important...

06:05.239 --> 06:06.474
Very important.

06:06.574 --> 06:08.184
More important, I suppose,
than getting married?

06:08.284 --> 06:09.284
Hmm?

06:11.162 --> 06:12.913
Oh! Oh!

06:13.498 --> 06:16.166
Mrs. Chatsworth,
I don't know what I'd ever do without you.

06:16.292 --> 06:18.236
Oh, go on!
You're getting a wonderful girl.

06:18.336 --> 06:19.696
If you ask me, she's too good for you.

06:19.796 --> 06:22.672
Thanks, Mrs. Chatsworth. I love you too.

06:23.424 --> 06:24.867
Don't you worry about a thing.

06:24.967 --> 06:26.676
I'll be in the first thing
in the morning to feed the dog.

06:27.178 --> 06:29.971
- Oh, what's the matter with me?
- Is anything wrong?

06:31.140 --> 06:33.683
What a lunkhead I am.
Instead of minus, it should be plus.

06:34.018 --> 06:37.020
So, the molecular configuration of A...

06:43.027 --> 06:45.388
is almost the same as that of B.

06:45.488 --> 06:49.350
Therefore, if I just don't worry about A
throwing off a little free hydrogen,

06:49.450 --> 06:51.269
it could stand
a few degrees more centigrade.

06:51.369 --> 06:52.854
Any child knows that.

06:52.954 --> 06:53.954
Yes, but remember,

06:53.996 --> 06:56.498
I promised that dear,
sweet girl I'd have you there on time.

06:56.874 --> 06:58.917
- Yes, Mrs. Chatsworth.
- And Professor,

06:59.335 --> 07:03.323
- may I say, "Happy honeymoon."
- You certainly may, Mrs. Chatsworth.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.840
And the same to you.

07:07.343 --> 07:10.204
Miscalculation's been staring me
in the face for weeks.

07:10.304 --> 07:12.332
Sometimes you can't see
the forest for the trees.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.099
Right, Charlie?

07:18.896 --> 07:21.398
All right, Charlie, cross your fingers.

07:36.372 --> 07:37.831
Now. Good.

07:38.875 --> 07:41.460
Good. Very good.

07:42.587 --> 07:44.504
That's good.

07:45.798 --> 07:46.798
Yes.

07:49.927 --> 07:51.761
Yes.

07:57.059 --> 07:58.059
Minus.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.907
Now.

08:13.784 --> 08:15.327
Now we're cooking, Charlie!

08:19.832 --> 08:21.416
We may be in business yet.

09:00.790 --> 09:02.791
It's just awful. Poor darling.

09:03.125 --> 09:07.155
What ails the man?
Missing his own wedding three times?

09:07.255 --> 09:08.614
Well, he might still show up.

09:08.714 --> 09:10.840
You know the old saying,
third time's the charm.

09:12.260 --> 09:14.302
I say three strikes, and you're out!

09:15.721 --> 09:18.708
Thank you all for coming. I...
I'll return your presents in the morning.

09:18.808 --> 09:21.043
I hope you can get your money back.

09:21.143 --> 09:23.812
I'm sorry,
after all the trouble you've gone to.

09:24.647 --> 09:27.216
I'll be at the office
at the usual time in the morning.

09:27.316 --> 09:29.796
- Now, my dear...
- I want to go on as if nothing has happened.

09:30.278 --> 09:32.904
Shelby, I don't seem to have an escort.

09:33.489 --> 09:35.824
- Would you mind waiting?
- I'm yours to command.

09:50.631 --> 09:52.366
Oh, Betsy.

09:53.050 --> 09:54.744
Oh, hello, Charlie.

09:54.844 --> 09:56.412
Go back to bed now.

09:56.512 --> 09:58.680
Let's go back to sleep, hmm?

10:03.060 --> 10:04.394
What...

10:05.187 --> 10:07.606
What happened?

10:14.572 --> 10:16.823
What happened?

10:36.636 --> 10:38.887
Well, that's the end of that.

11:35.236 --> 11:38.279
Get away, Charlie. Get away, Charlie.
Get away, Charlie.

12:02.972 --> 12:05.640
I'm not sure what we've got here, Charlie.

12:06.058 --> 12:09.587
But if we've got what I think we've got,
we've got something.

12:09.687 --> 12:12.188
There's one way to find out.

12:14.108 --> 12:15.817
Ready?

12:17.820 --> 12:21.156
Yes. Yes, Charlie. We've got it.

12:21.782 --> 12:24.226
You see what's happening?
It's not going lower and lower.

12:24.326 --> 12:25.486
It's going higher and higher.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.038
You know what that means, Charlie?

12:29.331 --> 12:33.209
It means just one thing,
it's generating its own energy.

12:34.295 --> 12:36.546
You know what that means, Charlie?

12:37.673 --> 12:40.800
It means we've discovered
a new kind of energy.

12:41.177 --> 12:43.261
A new kind of energy, Charlie.

12:44.680 --> 12:47.849
It's a breakthrough.
A breakthrough, Charlie.

12:56.442 --> 12:58.860
Discovered substance X.

12:59.695 --> 13:02.515
In appearance, subscribes
to classical requirements...

13:02.615 --> 13:04.225
Of metastable compound,

13:04.325 --> 13:07.327
but whose behavior
is distinctly nonclassical.

13:07.953 --> 13:12.081
Hypothesis, the application
of external force

13:12.208 --> 13:14.360
triggers a molecular change,

13:14.460 --> 13:18.713
liberating energy of a type
previously unknown.

13:19.882 --> 13:22.910
Well, Charlie, I suppose
you think these are just rubber balls,

13:23.010 --> 13:25.996
or maybe a flying rubber ball?

13:26.096 --> 13:28.223
But do you know what this really is?

13:29.809 --> 13:32.211
Of course you don't. How could you?
We've just discovered it.

13:32.311 --> 13:34.130
We've got to give it a name, Charlie.

13:34.230 --> 13:36.689
Let's see... Flying rubber.

13:37.316 --> 13:39.067
Flying rubber. Flubber?

13:40.736 --> 13:42.654
All right.

13:43.739 --> 13:45.365
Substance X...

13:49.286 --> 13:52.455
We dub thee... Flubber!

13:55.000 --> 13:57.069
Well, if our flubber's
going to be of any use to anyone,

13:57.169 --> 13:58.821
we've got to control it, right?

13:58.921 --> 14:03.591
So, we take an ordinary
radioactive isotope.

14:04.677 --> 14:08.205
Now, a sliding shutter to let just the
right amount of gamma rays through

14:08.305 --> 14:09.931
to bombard the flubber.

14:10.391 --> 14:13.836
Now, we put it under here, so that we can

14:13.936 --> 14:16.630
bombard the flubber with gamma rays

14:16.730 --> 14:18.940
to trigger the molecular change,

14:19.441 --> 14:22.344
which is certainly more scientific
than kicking it

14:22.444 --> 14:24.112
or bouncing it around the room.

14:26.532 --> 14:29.284
All right. Here we go.

14:40.963 --> 14:43.423
Eureka! It works!

14:49.763 --> 14:51.973
Perfect control.

14:52.641 --> 14:54.559
Now we ease off on the gamma rays.

15:05.696 --> 15:07.113
And back to Earth.

15:08.824 --> 15:10.074
Light as a daisy.

15:42.691 --> 15:44.025
Just as I thought.

15:45.194 --> 15:47.111
Just as I thought, Charlie.

15:47.821 --> 15:50.198
Weight makes absolutely no difference.

15:50.866 --> 15:52.951
Just shoot up a few extra gamma rays.

15:53.452 --> 15:55.411
Isn't that wonderful, Charlie?

15:59.500 --> 16:02.319
- Professor!
- Are you still here, Mrs. Chatsworth?

16:02.419 --> 16:04.530
What are you doing?
What about the wedding?

16:04.630 --> 16:07.324
Oh, I can still make it, Mrs. Chatsworth.
It's only five minutes to 8:00.

16:07.424 --> 16:09.243
Yes, five minutes to 8:00

16:09.343 --> 16:10.426
in the morning.

16:11.637 --> 16:12.887
In the morning?

16:14.932 --> 16:17.334
No! No, I didn't do it again.

16:17.434 --> 16:20.979
I, I gotta go see Betsy
and tell her what happened.

16:21.522 --> 16:23.465
I, I know what you're thinking,
Mrs. Chatsworth.

16:23.565 --> 16:25.900
But don't you worry.
Everything's gonna be all right.

16:27.277 --> 16:30.397
When I tell Betsy what I've got, she's
gonna be the happiest girl in the world.

16:33.742 --> 16:35.811
Mrs. Chatsworth, don't you tell a soul,

16:35.911 --> 16:37.954
but I've discovered flubber.

16:40.249 --> 16:42.458
That poor, poor girl.

16:44.753 --> 16:46.864
My dear, are you sure
it was wise to come in today?

16:46.964 --> 16:48.297
Oh, I'm perfectly all right.

16:49.717 --> 16:53.913
Mr. Alonzo Hawk, President of
the Auld Lang Syne loan company,

16:54.013 --> 16:55.513
et cetera, et cetera.

16:55.806 --> 16:57.750
My dear Mr. Hawk,

16:57.850 --> 17:00.544
during the past few days,
I have been disturbed by rumors

17:00.644 --> 17:02.671
that you plan to take
possession of our campus

17:02.771 --> 17:05.064
and construct a housing tract thereon.

17:06.400 --> 17:09.345
Oh, surely, he wouldn't.
Not even Mr. Hawk.

17:09.444 --> 17:13.281
Let's hope not, my dear, but
the situation requires delicate handling.

17:13.490 --> 17:14.741
But he's an alumnus!

17:16.117 --> 17:18.979
My dear girl, our esteemed alumnus

17:19.079 --> 17:21.397
made an extremely large loan
to the college.

17:21.498 --> 17:24.759
That loan is overdue,
and Mr. Hawk has us...

17:24.858 --> 17:28.412
If you forgive a pertinent expression,
over a barrel.

17:57.034 --> 18:01.438
However, my dear Mr. Hawk,
I am quite confident

18:01.538 --> 18:03.315
that I can, uh, demonstrate

18:03.415 --> 18:08.112
how an extension of your loan
would be in the best interest to all of us.

18:08.212 --> 18:11.198
I should like to suggest
a meeting at the earliest opportunity

18:11.298 --> 18:12.908
that would be convenient to you.

18:13.008 --> 18:15.160
Naturally, I shall
make myself available...

18:15.260 --> 18:17.346
- Psst!
- However...

18:18.146 --> 18:21.583
Don't be angry.
I'm sorry I missed the wedding again.

18:21.683 --> 18:23.017
Look, I couldn't help it.

18:23.685 --> 18:25.228
Don't be angry.

18:25.729 --> 18:28.799
Go. Get out of here.

18:28.899 --> 18:30.525
I don't want to see you.

18:30.859 --> 18:32.928
I was working in the laboratory
and an explosion...

18:33.028 --> 18:34.529
The whole thing blew up. Boom.

18:34.696 --> 18:37.099
Go. Get out of here.

18:37.199 --> 18:38.950
I do not wanna see you.

18:39.451 --> 18:41.186
I hit my head and fell on the floor.

18:41.286 --> 18:44.330
I, I was knocked out. Knocked out.

18:47.209 --> 18:48.876
Go. Get out.

18:50.045 --> 18:52.755
The most wonderful thing happened.
Wait till you hear.

18:53.048 --> 18:55.159
Look. Flubber.

18:55.259 --> 18:59.512
I shall make myself available at
any time you should care to name.

18:59.888 --> 19:01.931
Fuh-lubber. Flubber.

19:04.768 --> 19:07.812
No. Uh, make that,
of the most supreme importance.

19:08.021 --> 19:10.314
Flubber. It's called fuh-lubber.

19:11.066 --> 19:13.067
Fuh-lubber. Flubber.

19:15.237 --> 19:16.946
Flubber. Flubber.

19:22.578 --> 19:24.620
Flubber. Watch.

19:27.499 --> 19:28.875
Oh, uh, good morning, sir.

19:29.209 --> 19:31.849
I'd like to speak to Miss Carlisle,
if I may. It's quite important.

19:32.087 --> 19:33.822
Betsy, I...

19:33.922 --> 19:37.159
Sir, I just want to tell her
I'm sorry I missed the wedding.

19:37.259 --> 19:39.259
Betsy, I have the most
wonderful thing to tell you.

19:39.303 --> 19:41.830
The most wonderful thing
you can tell me is good-bye.

19:41.930 --> 19:43.850
- In which I heartily concur.
- This way, please.

19:43.932 --> 19:45.292
Oh, now, just a minute, President Daggett.

19:45.392 --> 19:46.710
If you'd just give me a chance
to explain to her,

19:46.810 --> 19:47.836
I'm sure she'd forgive me for everything.

19:47.936 --> 19:50.130
Anything you would have to say
will be entirely superfluous.

19:50.230 --> 19:51.856
Kindly take your ball and go.

19:56.987 --> 19:58.013
Daggett!

19:58.113 --> 20:00.390
Why, Mr. Hawk, what a pleasant surprise.

20:00.490 --> 20:02.017
I want a word with you, Daggett.

20:02.117 --> 20:04.853
Splendid! I, too, have been wanting
to have a chat about our little loan.

20:04.953 --> 20:07.038
- That'll be all, Professor Brainard.
- Brainard.

20:07.456 --> 20:09.483
Is this the one you call "Neddie the nut"?

20:09.583 --> 20:11.860
That's right, Pop, and I wish
you wouldn't make a federal case out...

20:11.960 --> 20:14.128
Do you know this man flunked my boy?

20:14.838 --> 20:16.255
No, Mr. Hawk.

20:16.673 --> 20:19.050
Mr. Hawk, I welcome this opportunity.

20:19.259 --> 20:21.829
Sometimes if the teacher and
the parent of the backward student

20:21.929 --> 20:23.413
- can get together...
- "Backward"?

20:23.513 --> 20:27.084
May I remind you, sir, that it was
Hawk brains that founded this town?

20:27.184 --> 20:30.129
Hawk brains that built it?
And you have the gall to say

20:30.229 --> 20:33.882
that my boy, who proudly
bears the name of Hawk, is backward?

20:33.982 --> 20:35.384
Pop, I'd just as soon
forget the whole thing.

20:35.484 --> 20:37.261
Will you shut up when I'm talking?

20:37.361 --> 20:39.737
I wish I could show you
his examination paper, Mr. Hawk.

20:40.113 --> 20:43.824
Not only did he miss every answer, he
even misspelled the name of the college.

20:44.034 --> 20:45.644
Professor, do you mind?

20:45.744 --> 20:47.828
I'd like to discuss
the matter alone with Mr. Hawk.

20:48.872 --> 20:50.315
Well, this means my boy can't play

20:50.415 --> 20:52.455
in the big game tonight
against Rutland, doesn't it?

20:52.668 --> 20:55.711
Where's your school spirit,
flunking your star player?

20:56.338 --> 20:57.781
I don't think this is the kind of a place

20:57.881 --> 20:59.881
a man would wanna lend
a half a million dollars to.

20:59.883 --> 21:02.911
Mr. Hawk, we happen to have
principles here at Medfield.

21:03.011 --> 21:06.051
I offered to help Biff, give him a make-up
exam, but he couldn't be bothered.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.749
All right, so he's ineligible.

21:07.849 --> 21:10.586
And none of your vague promises
about lending the school money

21:10.686 --> 21:11.686
is going to change that.

21:12.062 --> 21:15.022
Mr. Hawk has already loaned the money.
The school is very grateful.

21:15.983 --> 21:18.552
Professor, I rejoice
in your sense of ethics.

21:18.652 --> 21:21.763
But do you mind terribly
if I speak for myself?

21:21.863 --> 21:23.239
- Mr. Hawk...
- Hold it!

21:23.699 --> 21:25.658
I came here to have my say,
and I've said it.

21:26.034 --> 21:27.936
But, Mr. Hawk, a moment of your time.

21:28.036 --> 21:31.664
- I'd like to discuss our loan.
- Oh, you'd like to discuss our loan?

21:32.040 --> 21:34.193
Well, I have an office downtown for that!

21:34.293 --> 21:37.378
And you might bring along some of
those high-flown principles of yours...

21:37.879 --> 21:40.047
And see how much
they're worth in cold cash!

21:40.424 --> 21:41.966
Come on, Biffer!

21:44.720 --> 21:47.539
Get me the file on wealthy alumni,
the one marked "Double-A emergency."

21:47.639 --> 21:50.125
- We have some letters to write!
- Yes, sir.

21:50.225 --> 21:51.960
Betsy, you've got to let me
explain what happened.

21:52.060 --> 21:54.087
Then you'll understand
why I missed the wedding.

21:54.187 --> 21:55.896
Please, listen to me, Betsy.

21:56.606 --> 21:59.176
All right, go ahead. I'd like that.

21:59.276 --> 22:01.861
For once,
I would really like to understand.

22:02.362 --> 22:04.640
Well, darling, like most things
that seem complicated,

22:04.740 --> 22:06.308
it was actually quite simple.

22:06.408 --> 22:09.311
You see, all along, I was thinking
in terms of magnetic energy,

22:09.411 --> 22:11.611
when what I was after all the time
was repulsive energy.

22:12.289 --> 22:14.570
Silly, but you know how you
get carried away with an idea.

22:14.624 --> 22:15.750
Yes, I know.

22:15.876 --> 22:18.695
Now, if it hadn't been for this lucky
explosion, I might never have found it.

22:18.795 --> 22:20.822
See, the application
of external thermal energy

22:20.922 --> 22:23.700
to two previously incompatible
metastable compounds

22:23.800 --> 22:25.369
brought about fusion
at high temperature, combustion,

22:25.469 --> 22:27.845
the release of explosive gases
and an accompanying residue.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.831
And do you know
what that residue was, Betsy?

22:29.931 --> 22:30.931
No.

22:31.099 --> 22:32.376
Flubber.

22:32.476 --> 22:35.545
Flubber. Well, it's been thrilling.

22:35.645 --> 22:36.964
Now, if you'll excuse me.

22:37.064 --> 22:39.549
You know, Betsy, never
in my wildest dreams

22:39.649 --> 22:42.410
did I hope to find a metastable compound
whose molecular configuration

22:42.444 --> 22:44.846
is such that the delivery
of minute particles of energy

22:44.946 --> 22:47.641
to its surface would trigger
a change in the configuration.

22:47.741 --> 22:49.601
You see, this change in
molecular configuration

22:49.701 --> 22:51.603
liberates enormous quantities of energy.

22:51.703 --> 22:54.356
But they act only in a direction
opposite that of the force

22:54.456 --> 22:56.024
which triggered the molecular change.

22:56.124 --> 22:58.151
That's why we call it "Repulsive energy."

22:58.251 --> 22:59.861
That's the way I feel about it.

22:59.961 --> 23:02.698
Strangely enough, Betsy,
the total effect is transient.

23:02.798 --> 23:05.200
And upon the shutting off of
the externally applied energy,

23:05.300 --> 23:08.328
the elemental particles
return to a state of pseudo-equilibrium.

23:08.428 --> 23:09.804
- Isn't that wonderful?
- Yes.

23:10.347 --> 23:13.208
And now that I clearly understand
what happened to my wedding,

23:13.308 --> 23:14.960
will you excuse me, please?

23:15.060 --> 23:17.963
President Daggett and I have
some very important work to do,

23:18.063 --> 23:20.590
such as, I hope, saving the college.

23:20.690 --> 23:24.136
But Betsy, don't you see?
This can save the college.

23:24.236 --> 23:28.223
- It could be worth millions.
- Do me a personal favor?

23:28.323 --> 23:29.891
Go bounce your ball

23:29.991 --> 23:31.018
somewhere else.

23:31.118 --> 23:34.787
Well, we'll talk it out tonight, Betsy.
I'll pick you up for the game.

23:44.139 --> 23:46.340
Well, I guess we shook them up
a little, huh?

23:46.466 --> 23:49.828
- Nobody's gonna push us around.
- You're kidding, aren't you, Pop?

23:49.928 --> 23:51.621
I mean, about closing down the college

23:51.721 --> 23:54.666
and turning the grounds
into a housing tract?

23:54.766 --> 23:56.766
Son, I'm gonna teach you
some of the facts of life.

23:57.185 --> 24:00.729
The small college, like the small country
store and the little drug store,

24:00.856 --> 24:03.508
they're all in the same boat.
Well, they're sinking.

24:03.608 --> 24:06.928
Today is the day
of the supermarkets, the super colleges.

24:07.028 --> 24:09.155
The little man is gonna get squashed.

24:10.115 --> 24:13.685
But you graduated from Medfield.
It's your college.

24:13.785 --> 24:15.270
All right, so what do you want?

24:15.370 --> 24:17.731
Some total stranger to close it down?

24:17.831 --> 24:22.402
Or some loyal, friendly alumnus
to take care of things?

24:22.502 --> 24:23.945
But isn't there something you could do?

24:24.045 --> 24:26.990
I mean, give 'em some more time
on the loan or something?

24:27.090 --> 24:29.826
Now, look, son, I'm sentimental
about Medfield just like you,

24:29.926 --> 24:33.888
but it's like shooting a horse
that has a broken leg.

24:34.139 --> 24:37.584
I want to do it to put it
out of its misery.

24:37.684 --> 24:39.844
Now, if I happen to make
a few extra bucks on the side,

24:39.895 --> 24:44.648
well, that's just something
you're going to have to learn to accept.

24:45.609 --> 24:47.094
Yes, sir.

24:47.194 --> 24:48.512
Oh, about the game tonight.

24:48.612 --> 24:50.806
Has the word gotten around
that you're not playing?

24:50.906 --> 24:53.433
Not that I know of. Not yet.

24:53.533 --> 24:56.603
Say, Lenny, see what the point spread is

24:56.703 --> 24:58.772
on the Medfield Rutland game tonight,
will you?

24:58.872 --> 25:00.148
How much you wanna go for?

25:00.248 --> 25:03.944
Oh, whatever the traffic will bear.
8,000 or 10,000 bucks.

25:04.044 --> 25:05.987
Pop, you're not betting on Medfield?

25:06.087 --> 25:08.281
Without me on the team,
we'll get murdered.

25:08.381 --> 25:10.758
Who said I'm betting on Medfield?

25:11.801 --> 25:14.454
You're not betting against us?

25:14.554 --> 25:17.666
Now, son, we have access
to some very valuable information

25:17.766 --> 25:19.835
about that game tonight.

25:19.935 --> 25:21.336
There's an old saying,

25:21.436 --> 25:24.506
"It's an ill wind that doesn't blow
a few extra bucks into the coffers

25:24.606 --> 25:27.300
"of the Auld Lang Syne loan company."

25:27.400 --> 25:29.177
Get the point?

25:29.277 --> 25:31.263
Now, Charlie, when we pull down
the spark lever,

25:31.363 --> 25:33.890
this shutter opens and releases
the gamma rays.

25:33.990 --> 25:36.184
And up goes the flubber,
and up goes the car.

25:36.284 --> 25:38.270
Then, we pull down on the gas lever,
and this shutter opens

25:38.370 --> 25:39.521
and the car goes forward.

25:39.621 --> 25:41.273
Now, when we press on the brake pedal,

25:41.373 --> 25:43.817
this shutter opens and
the gamma rays bring the car to a stop.

25:43.917 --> 25:47.336
Or, if we open the shutter
a little farther, the car goes in reverse.

25:48.129 --> 25:51.950
Now, Charlie, suppose we get a little
tired of just going straight ahead.

25:52.050 --> 25:54.536
So, we turn the wheel to the right,

25:54.636 --> 25:57.622
and we bank to the right.

25:57.722 --> 26:00.641
Turn the wheel to the left,
and we bank to the left.

26:02.143 --> 26:04.504
Well, that's about it, Charlie.

26:04.604 --> 26:06.840
The important thing is that
nobody finds out about this,

26:06.940 --> 26:08.857
except Betsy, of course.

26:09.359 --> 26:11.386
Now, just so people
don't ask too many questions,

26:11.486 --> 26:14.847
we'll put this under the hood
so it'll sound like a regular old Model T.

26:15.824 --> 26:18.576
That ought to do it, eh, Charlie?

26:21.830 --> 26:24.483
Now all they'll say is,
"Well, Professor. Ha, ha.

26:24.583 --> 26:28.586
"See you finally got that old collector's
item of yours in running order."

26:30.130 --> 26:32.339
All right, Charlie, we're all set.

26:41.891 --> 26:44.101
All clear, Charlie.

26:50.609 --> 26:53.428
Now, I'll get your safety belt.

26:53.528 --> 26:56.431
Now this side. Good dog.

26:56.531 --> 26:59.518
Now, sound on.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.770
Lights on.

27:01.870 --> 27:04.038
And gas lever down.

27:08.043 --> 27:09.710
Hang on to your hat, Charlie.

27:31.733 --> 27:35.011
Ah, it handles beautifully, Charlie.

27:35.111 --> 27:37.514
We don't need these up here, do we?

27:37.614 --> 27:39.599
There, that's better, huh?

27:39.699 --> 27:42.910
Now. Now, watch this, Charlie.

27:50.210 --> 27:51.945
Not bad, eh, Charlie?

27:52.045 --> 27:54.922
Let's open her up and
see what she'll really do.

28:18.363 --> 28:21.683
Yahoo!

28:26.037 --> 28:28.565
Well, look what we've got down there.

28:30.166 --> 28:31.860
Look out, girls. Here we come.

28:38.675 --> 28:39.800
Look out, Charlie!

28:43.471 --> 28:47.349
I'll have to watch
where I'm going, huh? Yeah.

28:52.647 --> 28:54.090
Charlie, I've got an idea.

28:54.190 --> 28:57.526
Why don't we fly over and drop in
on that certain someone, huh?

29:01.823 --> 29:05.852
That lovely, adorable Betsy of mine

29:05.952 --> 29:10.482
Oh, won't she be happy Sweet Betsy of mine

29:10.582 --> 29:14.027
When we take her flyin' That Betsy of mine

29:14.127 --> 29:17.981
She'll hug me and tell me
She's not really sore

29:18.081 --> 29:22.627
That lovely, adorable Betsy of mine

29:42.363 --> 29:46.366
Can you imagine what she'll say
when she sees this, Charlie?

30:00.381 --> 30:02.283
Was there something you wanted?

30:02.383 --> 30:05.954
Yes. I'd like to speak
to Miss Carlisle, if you don't mind.

30:06.054 --> 30:07.455
I'm afraid I do, old man.

30:07.555 --> 30:10.458
Miss Carlisle and I are just leaving
for the game. Ready, dear?

30:10.558 --> 30:12.127
- Yes, Shelby.
- Betsy, before you go...

30:12.227 --> 30:13.545
Excuse us, please.

30:13.645 --> 30:16.047
Betsy, please come over here with me,
if you don't mind.

30:16.147 --> 30:17.966
I have the most wonderful
thing to show you.

30:18.066 --> 30:21.177
Ned, I am trying not to be angry.
Now, please, don't make a scene.

30:21.277 --> 30:22.429
- I'm not making...
- Yes, old man.

30:22.529 --> 30:24.013
Haven't you caused
Miss Carlisle enough embarrassment?

30:24.113 --> 30:25.598
- Come on, Betsy.
- Now look, you stay out of this!

30:25.698 --> 30:28.393
Betsy, it's a surprise.
It's a sort of wedding present.

30:28.493 --> 30:30.202
Just what every girl dreams about.

30:30.870 --> 30:34.149
It's not the car, Betsy.
It's what's inside the car.

30:34.249 --> 30:38.168
And I can't show it to you with him
around. Now, would you excuse us?

30:39.462 --> 30:42.323
Betsy! Betsy, wait!

30:42.423 --> 30:45.034
Betsy, you know what I was telling you
about this morning in the office?

30:45.134 --> 30:46.703
I mean, about my discovery?

30:46.803 --> 30:49.205
I want to show you what
I've done with it. It's terrific.

30:49.305 --> 30:51.833
All I want you to do is take one ride
around the block with me.

30:51.933 --> 30:54.268
Just one little ride, Betsy.

31:19.711 --> 31:20.904
Hey, how'd it go?

31:21.004 --> 31:23.698
Was a cinch. All the loot's down,
but I had to give 'em six to one.

31:23.798 --> 31:25.909
Cheap at the price. Get back on the phone.

31:26.009 --> 31:28.802
See if you can find any more
of that kind of money.

31:40.565 --> 31:43.343
I'm afraid it isn't Medfield's night.

31:43.443 --> 31:45.720
My dear, victory isn't everything.

31:45.820 --> 31:47.806
"To love the game beyond the prize,

31:47.906 --> 31:52.852
"to honor, while you strike him down,
the foe that comes with fearless eyes."

31:52.952 --> 31:55.104
- Excuse me.
- Ah, Professor.

31:55.204 --> 31:58.233
Pardon me, please.

31:58.333 --> 32:00.542
Late as usual, I see.

32:02.670 --> 32:05.339
Come on, Medfield!

32:16.684 --> 32:18.878
Sure hate to see you betting
against our own team.

32:18.978 --> 32:23.023
Betting? Why, this isn't betting.
This is like making it in the cellar.

32:46.673 --> 32:49.075
Oh, if Biff Hawk
were only playing tonight.

32:49.175 --> 32:52.302
Ah, yes, yes. I heard he was ineligible.

32:52.845 --> 32:56.666
Now, I wonder who could've
flunked your star player?

32:56.766 --> 32:59.419
We're much more realistic
about things like that at Rutland.

32:59.519 --> 33:00.519
So I hear.

33:00.812 --> 33:02.532
I understand you pay
your basketball players

33:02.563 --> 33:04.132
more than you do your English teachers.

33:04.232 --> 33:07.109
That's ridiculous!
I get twice as much as...

33:09.529 --> 33:12.447
I really don't care to discuss it.

33:23.334 --> 33:26.988
Our poor boys. They try so hard.

33:27.088 --> 33:30.199
Yes. I feel sorry for people who
don't know when they're beaten.

33:30.299 --> 33:32.160
Don't you, Professor?

33:32.260 --> 33:34.829
Now, Shelby, please don't start anything.

33:34.929 --> 33:39.083
Why doesn't he go down and sit in the
Rutland section where he belongs?

33:39.183 --> 33:40.851
I'm sorry.

34:11.299 --> 34:14.760
It's not fair.
Our team can't even reach the ball.

34:16.679 --> 34:18.748
Yeah!

34:18.848 --> 34:22.877
Yes, poor little chaps.
I'd say they need some kind of a lift.

34:22.976 --> 34:24.879
Why don't they try elevator heels?

34:24.978 --> 34:26.688
Very funny.

34:29.484 --> 34:30.984
Elevator heels.

34:31.610 --> 34:34.862
Pardon me. Pardon me, please.

34:54.592 --> 34:57.602
There's more than one way
to skin a cat, Charlie.

34:57.762 --> 35:01.082
She won't ride in my car with me. Okay.

35:01.182 --> 35:04.877
She won't listen to me. Okay.

35:04.977 --> 35:08.047
So, we're gonna surprise her, Charlie.

35:08.147 --> 35:09.867
More than that, we're gonna
flubbergast her.

35:19.033 --> 35:22.145
Boys, what can I say?

35:22.245 --> 35:25.440
I'm proud of you.

35:25.540 --> 35:28.943
They're murdering us,
but I'm proud of you.

35:29.043 --> 35:33.281
Remember, you're like sons to me,
all of you.

35:33.381 --> 35:35.324
How do you think I feel?

35:35.424 --> 35:37.243
Do you think it's easy,
sitting on that bench

35:37.343 --> 35:41.039
watching you guys out there
gettin' your ears pinned back?

35:41.139 --> 35:43.416
Well, let me tell you this.

35:43.516 --> 35:45.668
I've coached a lot of teams in my day,

35:45.768 --> 35:49.881
but I've never seen a harder
fighting bunch than you boys right here.

35:49.981 --> 35:52.633
You got heart. I mean, real heart.

35:52.733 --> 35:55.636
Coach, do we really
have to go back out there?

35:55.736 --> 35:59.724
Look, I know how you feel, son.

35:59.824 --> 36:03.034
But remember this,
a team that won't be beaten...

36:04.245 --> 36:05.745
Well, Professor!

36:06.998 --> 36:08.983
- Oh, hello, Coach.
- Something the matter?

36:09.083 --> 36:11.360
Or maybe something on your conscience?

36:11.460 --> 36:14.947
No, no, no. I just dropped by
to see if there was anything I could do.

36:15.047 --> 36:17.808
Oh, I am sorry that I had to flunk
Biff Hawk, if that's what you mean.

36:18.384 --> 36:20.927
Well, it's a little late for apologies,
don't you think?

36:21.512 --> 36:22.622
One minute, Coach.

36:22.722 --> 36:24.832
Okay. All right, boys, get ready.

36:24.932 --> 36:27.460
Starting lineup same as the first half.

36:27.560 --> 36:31.255
Fellas, it's too bad Biff didn't keep his
grades up, but that's one of those things.

36:31.355 --> 36:33.925
Just remember,
one man doesn't make a team.

36:34.025 --> 36:37.303
And I tell you, you can go out
in this second half and beat Rutland.

36:37.403 --> 36:38.846
You can win this game.

36:38.946 --> 36:41.114
- Oh, sure, we can.
- Yes, you can!

36:41.616 --> 36:44.602
Because I know something
about you that you don't know.

36:44.702 --> 36:47.582
They're twice as big as we are, but that
doesn't make any difference now.

36:47.622 --> 36:51.859
No difference at all. They could be
10 feet tall, and we could still beat them.

36:51.959 --> 36:53.861
Yes, we could!

36:53.961 --> 36:55.696
You can beat Rutland if you go
out there and give it

36:55.796 --> 36:57.949
all the drive and the bounce you've got.

36:58.049 --> 37:00.785
Remember that word, bounce. Bounce.

37:00.885 --> 37:04.705
And when you bounce, remember this,
no matter how much you put into it,

37:04.805 --> 37:06.525
you're going to get twice
as much out of it.

37:07.183 --> 37:10.393
Now, get out there, fellas, and hop to it.

37:16.150 --> 37:19.694
Come on, Rutland. Mow them down!

37:44.053 --> 37:45.887
Say, what's goin' on out there?

38:05.616 --> 38:07.602
- What got into them?
- I don't know!

38:07.702 --> 38:10.062
Maybe it was that pep talk
Professor Brainard gave them.

38:10.162 --> 38:13.790
- Well, what did he say?
- I wish I could remember!

38:30.683 --> 38:32.183
- Go, Medfield!
- Go!

38:37.440 --> 38:38.716
Will you listen to me?

38:38.816 --> 38:41.010
I tell you, there's something fishy
going on out there!

38:41.110 --> 38:43.596
All right, what? You tell me!

38:43.696 --> 38:46.140
Well, how do I know! Something!

38:46.240 --> 38:47.600
Well, what am I supposed to do?

38:47.700 --> 38:51.060
There's nothing in the rule book that says
one team can't jump higher than the other.

38:51.078 --> 38:52.412
Now get back to your bench.

39:06.260 --> 39:08.788
Gosh, Pop, look at 'em go! Look it!

39:08.888 --> 39:11.097
I'm looking!

39:28.199 --> 39:30.325
Come on, Medfield! Come on, team!

39:55.935 --> 39:56.935
Come on, Medfield!

40:27.466 --> 40:31.829
Come on, team!
Oh, look at 'em go. Aren't they terrific?

40:31.929 --> 40:35.348
Sorry, Pop, I forgot. Come on, team!

41:23.230 --> 41:24.632
Hey, chief, what do you know?

41:24.732 --> 41:27.301
Lenny just laid off another five Gs
against Medfield.

41:27.401 --> 41:31.180
Against Medfield?
Thank you so much. You meathead!

41:31.280 --> 41:33.156
Don't you know what's going on out there?

42:07.399 --> 42:08.858
Shoot, Humphrey! Shoot!

42:22.540 --> 42:23.665
Go, go!

42:44.979 --> 42:47.339
- We did it!
- Sure, we did it.

42:47.439 --> 42:49.717
The reason I did it, Betsy,
is because you wouldn't listen to me.

42:49.817 --> 42:51.635
What do you mean you did it?

42:51.735 --> 42:53.721
Well, you saw the way
the boys played tonight.

42:53.821 --> 42:56.056
The only reason they could play
like that is because of my discovery.

42:56.156 --> 42:57.356
You see, I took their shoes...

42:57.366 --> 42:59.806
Surely, you're not taking credit
for Medfield winning tonight?

42:59.827 --> 43:02.313
- Well, in a way, yes.
- Now, I've heard everything.

43:02.413 --> 43:06.692
To watch those boys out there tonight,
fighting, playing their hearts out to win,

43:06.792 --> 43:09.487
and now to hear you
standing here taking the bows for it.

43:09.587 --> 43:10.905
Well, I didn't mean it that way exactly.

43:11.005 --> 43:12.907
Pretty small, Brainard.
That's all I can say.

43:13.007 --> 43:14.283
Pretty small.

43:14.383 --> 43:15.910
- Well...
- Come on, let's go.

43:16.010 --> 43:19.220
No, Betsy! Betsy, wait a minute. Let me...

43:51.253 --> 43:54.573
Shelby, please give me time to think.

43:54.673 --> 43:55.824
Of course, darling.

43:55.924 --> 43:58.786
You can give me your answer
tomorrow night after the dance.

43:58.886 --> 44:03.082
And I think I know what it'll be.

44:03.182 --> 44:04.792
Good night, my love.

44:04.892 --> 44:06.893
Good night, Shelby.

44:36.256 --> 44:39.326
You've probably always thought of me
as a kindly levelheaded professor,

44:39.426 --> 44:41.453
haven't you, Charlie?

44:41.553 --> 44:44.123
Well, now you see
what a woman can do to you.

44:44.223 --> 44:48.335
I'm a desperate man, Charlie,
and desperate men do desperate things.

44:48.435 --> 44:52.605
Lights off, sound off and up we go.

46:38.212 --> 46:40.531
Officer! Officer!

46:40.631 --> 46:43.257
Officer, help me! It's after me! Help me!

46:43.967 --> 46:47.287
I do hope that you will
excuse my appearance,

46:47.387 --> 46:50.499
but I was just having
a cup of boiling hot coffee.

46:50.599 --> 46:52.767
- But it's after me!
- What's after you?

46:53.101 --> 46:55.520
I don't know. Some kind of a thing!

46:55.938 --> 46:58.799
A thing? Can you describe it?

46:58.899 --> 47:01.192
No, I didn't see it. But it flies!

47:01.443 --> 47:03.345
And it, and it, and it made a noise.

47:03.445 --> 47:05.973
Like, uh, "Aaoogah, ahoogah."

47:06.073 --> 47:09.435
And then it banged down on the top
of my car, "Voom! Voom! Voom!"

47:09.535 --> 47:11.744
And when I looked,
there wasn't anything there.

47:12.079 --> 47:15.733
Ohh! That kind of a thing.

47:15.833 --> 47:17.943
Well, suppose you blow
into this little thing,

47:18.043 --> 47:20.112
and we'll see if we can't
find out where it came from, all right?

47:20.212 --> 47:23.240
Well, do something. It's probably
lurking up there in the dark right now,

47:23.340 --> 47:25.451
ready to spring! Go on!

47:25.551 --> 47:27.786
Don't, don't worry.
We won't let it get you.

47:27.886 --> 47:29.163
Now, come on, blow, okay?

47:29.263 --> 47:31.790
This is outrageous.
You're behaving like savages!

47:31.890 --> 47:34.626
I happen to be Professor Ashton,
head of the English department

47:34.726 --> 47:36.003
at Rutland college,

47:36.103 --> 47:37.770
and a very important person there.

47:37.938 --> 47:42.926
Well, now, in that case, this ought to be
easy for an English teacher.

47:43.026 --> 47:46.764
Can you say, "Peter piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers"?

47:46.864 --> 47:48.015
Have you gone mad?

47:48.115 --> 47:49.975
Or, perhaps you'd prefer,

47:50.075 --> 47:53.353
"Round the rugged rock,
the ragged rascal ran."

47:53.453 --> 47:55.355
I'll say no such idiotic thing.

47:55.455 --> 47:58.817
We are not being
very cooperative, now, are we?

47:58.917 --> 48:01.779
Come on. Blow into this.
We'd appreciate it very much.

48:01.879 --> 48:04.964
I'll do no such thing. I'll... I'll...

48:05.674 --> 48:06.674
Blow!

48:13.724 --> 48:16.043
Having a little trouble, Officer Hanson?

48:16.143 --> 48:18.603
No, just the usual.

48:18.896 --> 48:21.757
We always have a few 502s
after the Rutland game.

48:21.857 --> 48:24.483
Uh-huh. I didn't know
they were such bad losers.

48:24.610 --> 48:27.778
Brainard! Tell these idiots...

48:28.363 --> 48:32.851
Well, Professor, I see you finally got
the old Model T in working order.

48:32.951 --> 48:36.162
Yeah. Yeah, it took a little
fixing, but, ah, here she is.

48:36.288 --> 48:41.068
Say, sounds like you could use
a little valve job in there.

48:41.168 --> 48:42.903
Oh, you know Model Ts.

48:43.003 --> 48:45.697
Sometimes you could swear
they could run without valves.

48:45.797 --> 48:48.980
- Or even without a motor.
- That's right. So long, Officer.

48:49.080 --> 48:50.909
So long, Professor.

48:51.011 --> 48:54.972
Brainard! Tell them who I am!

48:55.349 --> 48:57.584
Now, you told us who you are.

48:57.684 --> 49:00.645
Suppose we all go confide
in the sergeant, hmm?

49:18.413 --> 49:20.524
You know, you boys
are a big comfort to me.

49:20.624 --> 49:23.944
I take a bath for 15,000 bucks, and
you two can't find out what happened.

49:24.044 --> 49:26.697
Maybe they slipped them
some new kind of vitamin pill.

49:26.797 --> 49:29.700
If we could grab one of the boys,
we could give him a saliva test.

49:29.800 --> 49:31.342
Oh, forget it, would you?

49:31.718 --> 49:32.718
Hi, Pop.

49:33.387 --> 49:35.122
Well, did you find out anything?

49:35.222 --> 49:36.582
- I sure did.
- What?

49:36.682 --> 49:37.791
It was Neddie the Nut.

49:37.891 --> 49:40.294
The professor? Well, what did he do?

49:40.394 --> 49:41.712
He was in the locker room
between halves...

49:41.812 --> 49:43.062
And then?

49:43.188 --> 49:45.564
- He gave the boys a pep talk.
- What else?

49:46.775 --> 49:47.968
That's all. He just talked to them.

49:48.068 --> 49:49.845
Talked to them? Is that the...

49:49.945 --> 49:54.073
Will you give me that?
Is that the big news you had for me?

49:54.908 --> 49:57.644
- Well, is it?
- That's about the size of it, Pop.

49:57.744 --> 50:00.022
Oh, well, three cheers for you, sonny.

50:00.122 --> 50:03.416
That's an Earth-shattering bit
of information you got there.

50:09.256 --> 50:12.466
Biff! Come here! Come here!

50:13.260 --> 50:14.927
You see anything?

50:15.595 --> 50:18.582
Just Neddie the Nut
flying his old Model T.

50:18.682 --> 50:20.307
Say that again.

50:20.851 --> 50:24.520
Neddie the Nut flying his old Model... T.

50:24.896 --> 50:28.691
Yeah! And that's the genius
you were callin' a nut.

50:29.568 --> 50:34.181
Oh, yeah, in class he's been beatin'
our ears about some new kind of energy.

50:34.281 --> 50:36.308
Says he's lookin' for a breakthrough.
Some kinda jazz like that.

50:36.408 --> 50:37.658
Breakthrough?

50:38.452 --> 50:41.104
Have you any idea

50:41.204 --> 50:44.040
what that kind of jazz is worth?

50:55.469 --> 50:56.787
Someone to see you, Professor.

50:56.887 --> 50:59.498
Oh, I can't see anybody now,
Mrs. Chatsworth. What does he want?

50:59.598 --> 51:02.209
Your kind indulgence, Professor.

51:02.309 --> 51:05.712
Can you find it in your heart
to forgive this hotblooded businessman?

51:05.812 --> 51:09.424
Uh, hotblooded businessman who
plans to tear down Medfield College?

51:09.524 --> 51:10.604
What do you want, Mr. Hawk?

51:10.650 --> 51:13.903
Wonderful things.
Wonderful things for all of us.

51:14.362 --> 51:17.933
Visualize, if you will,
a whole new Medfield College.

51:18.033 --> 51:20.117
Ten new buildings, 10 stories high.

51:20.410 --> 51:22.995
One building devoted entirely to science.

51:25.082 --> 51:28.501
Two, if you will? Three?

51:30.337 --> 51:32.963
- How does it sound?
- It sounds great.

51:33.673 --> 51:37.927
But, uh, just where is all this
money coming from, Mr. Hawk?

51:38.595 --> 51:42.181
From a certain revolutionary discovery.

51:44.059 --> 51:46.169
What's so revolutionary
about an old Tin Lizzie?

51:46.269 --> 51:48.005
Nothing,

51:48.105 --> 51:51.982
unless, of course, it happens to fly.

51:54.694 --> 51:57.822
- Fly?
- Like I happened to see it do last night.

51:59.908 --> 52:01.408
Oh. You saw it, huh?

52:02.077 --> 52:03.369
Uh-huh.

52:04.871 --> 52:06.273
Prof, I gotta hand it to you.
You sure know...

52:06.373 --> 52:09.109
Hold it. Hold it.

52:09.209 --> 52:11.009
Now, why don't we trust
each other, Professor?

52:11.044 --> 52:13.321
After all, you're
a man of science, head in the clouds.

52:13.421 --> 52:15.741
I'm a down-to-Earth, dollar-and-cents man.

52:15.841 --> 52:18.160
That's right. My pop always says
he can smell a buck 10 miles...

52:18.260 --> 52:20.261
I'll do the talking, son!

52:21.096 --> 52:22.414
That's a good boy.

52:22.514 --> 52:25.959
There's a million angles to this.
The government! The space age!

52:26.059 --> 52:30.254
What they wouldn't give to get their
sticky hands on this little tin.

52:30.981 --> 52:32.481
That's where I come in.

52:33.525 --> 52:35.005
When I get through talking with them,

52:35.068 --> 52:37.508
they'll come crawling to us on
their knees with bags of money,

52:37.571 --> 52:38.946
barrels of money!

52:40.240 --> 52:42.809
Mr. Hawk, let me get this straight.

52:42.909 --> 52:46.537
You want me to turn my discovery over to
you so you can blackmail our government?

52:47.122 --> 52:49.149
All right then, look at it this way.

52:49.249 --> 52:51.818
Medfield College can grow and prosper,

52:51.918 --> 52:55.546
or it can wither and die on the vine.

52:56.631 --> 52:58.158
That's entirely up to you.

52:58.258 --> 52:59.466
I see.

53:00.635 --> 53:02.662
Mr. Hawk,
I want to thank you for dropping by.

53:02.762 --> 53:05.764
- You've made up my mind for me.
- Now you're talking.

53:06.433 --> 53:08.001
I'm going to call the President.

53:08.101 --> 53:10.561
Daggett? He don't cut any ice.

53:11.730 --> 53:13.189
The President of the United States.

53:13.440 --> 53:15.467
Is that enough ice for you?

53:15.567 --> 53:18.178
Now, see here.
Let's not go flying off in all directions.

53:18.278 --> 53:20.055
Just one direction, Mr. Hawk. Out!

53:20.155 --> 53:22.724
Don't get me wrong.
I heartily endorse our government.

53:22.824 --> 53:24.559
- Oh, I'm sure you do.
- I approve of our government.

53:24.659 --> 53:27.229
All right. You're lowering
the boom on poor old Medfield College,

53:27.329 --> 53:29.773
but don't you try to come back afterwards.

53:29.873 --> 53:31.624
The iron door is shut!

53:38.632 --> 53:40.784
Well, there goes the ball game.

53:40.884 --> 53:42.786
He'll telephone Washington,
and by tomorrow,

53:42.886 --> 53:45.497
this place will be swarming with sharpies.

53:45.597 --> 53:48.208
Supposing you did get
the professor's discovery?

53:48.308 --> 53:50.142
Did you mean what you said about
not closing down Medfield?

53:50.560 --> 53:52.640
If they get a hold of that flying jalopy
before I do,

53:52.646 --> 53:54.256
there's millions right down the drain.

53:54.356 --> 53:56.174
Because if you did, I've got an idea.

53:56.274 --> 53:59.052
- Quiet, son. I'm tryin' to think.
- Switch cars on him.

53:59.152 --> 54:01.695
That idiot Brainard! If he could have...

54:06.368 --> 54:07.368
What did you say, son?

54:07.452 --> 54:10.079
Switch cars on him.
There are other Model Ts around.

54:10.997 --> 54:13.859
Yeah. There are, aren't there, Biffer?

54:13.959 --> 54:17.571
- There's a fellow in Appleton that's...
- Hold it. I'm way ahead of ya.

54:17.671 --> 54:20.733
Lenny, take the Appleton turnoff.

54:21.633 --> 54:23.702
Hey, you know something?

54:23.802 --> 54:25.719
You're all right, son.

54:26.596 --> 54:28.123
Of course, you got a little
of your mother in you,

54:28.223 --> 54:30.933
but actually, well,
you're just me all over again.

54:32.394 --> 54:34.770
Yes, sir. You're all right.

54:41.486 --> 54:44.097
I can assure you, sir,
the President is keenly interested

54:44.197 --> 54:47.767
in any development which might
have to do with our national welfare.

54:47.867 --> 54:51.537
But may I inquire as to
the nature of your discovery?

54:54.124 --> 54:55.374
Flubber?

54:56.042 --> 54:59.112
Yes, that does sound significant.

54:59.212 --> 55:01.948
Now, if I only knew which
branch of the government

55:02.048 --> 55:04.451
might best be served by your discovery.

55:04.551 --> 55:08.246
Why, any branch. You name it.
Transportation, industry, agriculture.

55:08.346 --> 55:11.499
Agriculture. Good.

55:11.599 --> 55:13.350
Oh, don't cut me off.

55:13.476 --> 55:16.353
Agriculture department.
Sam Wheeler speaking.

55:17.272 --> 55:18.731
Splendid.

55:19.482 --> 55:20.983
Mmm-hmm, I see.

55:21.443 --> 55:23.720
Just how do you figure
this can help the farmer?

55:23.820 --> 55:26.973
I don't want to help the farmer.
I want to help everybody.

55:27.073 --> 55:28.115
Don't you understand?

55:28.241 --> 55:31.770
Well, now, what possibilities do you
think this might have as a fertilizer?

55:31.870 --> 55:33.772
Fertilizer?

55:33.872 --> 55:37.067
Don't any of you people down there
understand how vital this thing is?

55:37.167 --> 55:41.086
It's not only agricultural,
it's industry, it's national defense.

55:41.421 --> 55:44.757
Oh, national defense. National defense.

55:50.764 --> 55:53.416
Before we go any further,
I just want you to know

55:53.516 --> 55:56.962
that I am proud of the new
spirit of cooperation

55:57.062 --> 56:00.006
between the Army,
the Navy and the Air Force.

56:00.106 --> 56:02.175
Even the newspaper columnists
are talking about it.

56:02.275 --> 56:03.635
There never was any real
difference between us.

56:03.735 --> 56:04.735
Of course not.

56:04.778 --> 56:06.805
Just a lot of newspaper
guff in the first place.

56:06.905 --> 56:10.449
Excuse me, sir. There's a Professor
Brainard on the phone from Medfield.

56:10.784 --> 56:12.978
Brainard? I don't know
any Professor Brainard.

56:13.078 --> 56:14.437
Tell him to write me a letter.

56:14.537 --> 56:16.856
He might have some connection with
Congressman Brainard.

56:16.956 --> 56:18.525
On the Appropriations Committee.

56:18.625 --> 56:20.443
Congressman Brainard swings a lot of lead.

56:20.543 --> 56:22.127
He's always been friendly to us.

56:22.629 --> 56:24.630
Oh, very well.

56:26.257 --> 56:29.536
Hello. Well, how are you, Professor?

56:29.636 --> 56:31.303
What can we do for you?

56:33.098 --> 56:36.642
Oh, you have, eh? Why, that's amazing.

56:36.810 --> 56:39.144
It's sort of antigravity.

56:39.729 --> 56:41.464
Well, well.

56:41.564 --> 56:44.316
And you think it's a breakthrough?

56:44.984 --> 56:48.388
Looks like you fellas don't need
all that appropriation money after all.

56:48.488 --> 56:51.683
I got a fella right here said he cracked
the antigravity problem

56:51.783 --> 56:53.117
right in his own garage.

56:53.660 --> 56:56.495
- Ridiculous.
- Another crackpot.

56:57.330 --> 56:59.816
The Army's been doing
antigravity research for years.

56:59.916 --> 57:02.167
Hasn't come up with
anything significant yet.

57:02.544 --> 57:05.905
Oh, yes, Professor. I'm listening.

57:06.005 --> 57:09.576
Yes, Professor.
Yes. Yes, I realize it's urgent.

57:09.676 --> 57:11.911
So many things are these days.

57:12.011 --> 57:14.972
Oh? You want to come
down here to Washington?

57:15.515 --> 57:17.500
Well, now, I don't know
about that, Professor.

57:17.600 --> 57:19.419
We'd love to see you, of course.

57:19.519 --> 57:21.254
Alert my pilot to stand by.

57:21.354 --> 57:24.674
Yes, but we are all busy
as bird dogs around here.

57:24.774 --> 57:26.092
I tell you what, Professor.

57:26.192 --> 57:30.347
Why don't you write us
a nice short letter?

57:30.447 --> 57:32.474
Tell us all about it.

57:32.574 --> 57:35.960
Right, and keep up
the good work, Professor.

57:36.060 --> 57:39.496
Call us any time.
Or better still, we'll call you.

57:40.206 --> 57:41.457
Good-bye.

57:42.375 --> 57:43.443
Good-bye.

57:43.543 --> 57:46.279
They won't listen. Betsy won't listen.

57:46.379 --> 57:48.806
That crook, Hawk, is the only
one that'll believe me.

57:48.906 --> 57:51.933
- Professor?
- Come in, Mrs. Chatsworth.

57:52.135 --> 57:54.954
There you are. All sponged and pressed
for the dance tonight.

57:55.054 --> 57:57.999
Oh, thank you,
but I won't be going to the dance.

57:58.099 --> 58:01.685
Oh, no. You're not letting that dear,
sweet girl go with someone else?

58:02.187 --> 58:04.798
That dear, sweet girl has
kicked me out of her life.

58:04.898 --> 58:07.967
Well, what are you gonna do about it?
Stay home and talk to the dog?

58:08.067 --> 58:10.402
Mrs. Chatsworth,
don't you turn against me too.

58:10.737 --> 58:12.806
Professor, may I say something?

58:12.906 --> 58:15.433
I'd rather you wouldn't,
Mrs. Chatsworth. Not just now.

58:15.533 --> 58:18.144
All right. Do as you please.

58:18.244 --> 58:19.854
Go on with your head in the clouds

58:19.954 --> 58:22.941
and your nose poked places
that it doesn't belong.

58:23.041 --> 58:26.418
Go ahead, like I said.
Unlock the secrets of the universe.

58:26.669 --> 58:27.987
But remember this,

58:28.087 --> 58:31.840
the universe is millions and
millions and millions of years old.

58:32.217 --> 58:35.219
It can wait a little,
but girls can't wait.

58:35.970 --> 58:38.039
Mrs. Chatsworth,
I've told you I'm not going...

58:38.139 --> 58:41.475
One day, a girl simply says to herself,

58:41.809 --> 58:46.271
"That's enough. I'll just marry the next
man that comes along."

58:46.773 --> 58:47.981
And she does.

58:48.900 --> 58:49.968
Mrs. Chatsworth...

58:50.068 --> 58:53.513
If I were in your shoes, I'd stop that
smashing or mashing the atom,

58:53.613 --> 58:57.282
or whatever it is you're doing out there,
and I'd go to that dance.

58:57.825 --> 59:00.186
Why? Betsy won't even look at me.

59:00.286 --> 59:01.688
Don't they have those numbers

59:01.788 --> 59:04.107
where you walk up to the dancers
and tap 'em on the shoulders?

59:04.207 --> 59:05.817
- Yes. I suppose.
- Well, then.

59:05.917 --> 59:08.627
You walk up to Shelby,
tap him on the shoulder,

59:08.795 --> 59:11.322
- then when he turns around...
- I'll punch him in the nose.

59:11.422 --> 59:12.589
Good.

59:13.424 --> 59:15.160
No, that wouldn't be civilized.

59:15.260 --> 59:16.703
Well, for goodness' sake.

59:16.803 --> 59:21.458
Grab the girl in your arms, hold her tight
and dance her off into the night.

59:21.558 --> 59:22.558
Show him up.

59:23.393 --> 59:26.186
Show up Shelby Ashton, the ballroom beast?

59:26.437 --> 59:28.506
He's the best dancer around here.

59:28.606 --> 59:31.134
I dance like a sleepwalking chimpanzee.

59:31.234 --> 59:34.319
Well, even a chimpanzee
will fight for its mate.

01:00:05.727 --> 01:00:07.519
I told you he'd turn up here tonight.

01:01:56.379 --> 01:01:59.365
And sink the Army
Sink the Army gray

01:01:59.465 --> 01:02:00.465
Taxi!

01:02:07.432 --> 01:02:10.475
You boys get right in.
I'm the only taxi. I'm pulling right out.

01:02:22.238 --> 01:02:23.238
Where to?

01:02:23.614 --> 01:02:26.158
Professor Brainard's... House.

01:03:00.234 --> 01:03:01.594
What are you doing?

01:03:01.694 --> 01:03:03.945
Even a chimpanzee fights for its mate.

01:03:11.245 --> 01:03:12.537
Oh!

01:03:13.915 --> 01:03:16.542
Let me go. People are looking.

01:03:16.918 --> 01:03:18.945
Good. Let's not disappoint them.

01:03:20.338 --> 01:03:22.258
The professor must have
given himself a pep talk.

01:03:22.423 --> 01:03:24.766
Watch. Maybe you can learn something.

01:03:30.189 --> 01:03:31.389
Go, prof. Go!

01:03:31.891 --> 01:03:33.418
We ought to do this more often.

01:03:33.518 --> 01:03:36.353
Will you let... Oh! Oh!

01:03:39.398 --> 01:03:42.067
Oh! Oh! Oh.

01:03:44.195 --> 01:03:45.529
Oh, Ned!

01:04:20.273 --> 01:04:23.885
He flies through the air
with the greatest of ease

01:04:23.985 --> 01:04:26.778
The daring young man
on the flying trapeze...

01:04:32.034 --> 01:04:33.394
I wonder what's going on inside.

01:04:33.494 --> 01:04:36.955
- Let's go in and see what's buzzing.
- Enough fun for one night.

01:04:37.456 --> 01:04:40.959
He flies through the air
with the greatest of ease...

01:04:41.294 --> 01:04:43.795
On second thought,
maybe the fun's just beginning.

01:04:47.466 --> 01:04:50.870
I beg your pardon. Are you the
gentlemen from Washington?

01:04:50.970 --> 01:04:53.114
- We are.
- Are you looking for a Professor...

01:04:53.264 --> 01:04:56.432
- Brainard?
- Oh, I'm afraid that's not me.

01:04:56.809 --> 01:04:58.727
There's your man.

01:04:59.061 --> 01:05:03.106
The daring young man
on the flying trapeze...

01:05:06.652 --> 01:05:10.389
The man on the flying trapeze

01:05:10.489 --> 01:05:13.226
Oh

01:05:13.326 --> 01:05:16.244
He flies through the air
with the greatest of ease

01:05:17.204 --> 01:05:20.441
It certainly is a surprise, your coming
all the way from Washington to see me.

01:05:20.541 --> 01:05:23.501
Here we are. Get right in, gentlemen.

01:05:24.795 --> 01:05:27.672
Get right in the car, please.
Admiral, General.

01:05:36.223 --> 01:05:39.001
Now, of course, gentlemen,
I realize that military technology

01:05:39.101 --> 01:05:41.045
has progressed far beyond
the Model T, right?

01:05:41.145 --> 01:05:43.089
- Of course.
- I want you to understand

01:05:43.189 --> 01:05:45.174
I'm using it as a security measure.

01:05:45.274 --> 01:05:48.760
What better place to hide
my discovery than in a Model T?

01:05:49.070 --> 01:05:50.638
And I want you to keep
in mind also, gentlemen,

01:05:50.738 --> 01:05:53.474
that this is only a primitive
application of my discovery.

01:05:53.574 --> 01:05:57.019
Now, we use this
spark lever here to levitate,

01:05:57.119 --> 01:05:58.813
the gas lever to move forward,

01:05:58.913 --> 01:06:01.065
and the brake pedal to stop
or to go in reverse.

01:06:01.165 --> 01:06:04.193
Absolute control at all times,
as you will see.

01:06:04.293 --> 01:06:07.697
All right, gentlemen,
get a good, tight grip on your emotions,

01:06:07.797 --> 01:06:09.547
and prepare for takeoff.

01:06:14.762 --> 01:06:19.474
A cool head, a steady hand, and up we go!

01:06:24.730 --> 01:06:26.924
Well, if at first you don't succeed...

01:06:27.024 --> 01:06:28.441
Then what?

01:06:29.235 --> 01:06:30.652
You try again.

01:06:38.202 --> 01:06:41.522
Well, surely you gentlemen
understand this sort of thing.

01:06:41.622 --> 01:06:44.916
I imagine the first time
you tried to launch a rocket, it didn't...

01:06:47.253 --> 01:06:48.586
Go up.

01:06:49.672 --> 01:06:52.173
It's probably just a short
in the control mechanism.

01:06:53.092 --> 01:06:55.036
I'm sorry about this
little delay, gentlemen.

01:06:55.136 --> 01:06:57.288
We'll have the show
in the air in a minute.

01:07:03.894 --> 01:07:06.146
This is some kind of a joke.
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

01:07:17.116 --> 01:07:19.352
I tell you, gentlemen, somebody is just
playing a practical joke.

01:07:19.452 --> 01:07:20.618
I'm not laughing.

01:07:21.537 --> 01:07:22.857
Just a minute, gentlemen. Please.

01:07:23.456 --> 01:07:25.415
Gentlemen, wait. Please.

01:07:34.966 --> 01:07:37.536
Nice going.
That was rich about the squirrel.

01:07:37.636 --> 01:07:39.596
A real Hawk touch.

01:07:40.306 --> 01:07:42.249
Kind of a mean trick
to play on the professor.

01:07:42.349 --> 01:07:44.976
Well, now, son,
we're doing him a favor. You'll see.

01:07:47.313 --> 01:07:50.466
Well, I think we've
cleared the air on one important point.

01:07:50.566 --> 01:07:51.717
What's that?

01:07:51.817 --> 01:07:54.098
With what's happened, I'm sure
there's no longer any doubt

01:07:54.195 --> 01:07:55.695
about you and Ned Brainard.

01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:59.558
No. None whatsoever.

01:07:59.658 --> 01:08:02.228
As the Bard says,
"That he is mad, 'tis true,

01:08:02.328 --> 01:08:04.996
"'tis true, 'tis pity,
and pity 'tis 'tis true."

01:08:05.831 --> 01:08:07.499
Oh, shut up.

01:08:10.336 --> 01:08:13.004
Well, if that's what
she thinks of Shakespeare.

01:08:20.011 --> 01:08:21.054
Ned?

01:08:22.807 --> 01:08:25.584
If you've come out here to gloat,
Betsy, I can do without that.

01:08:25.684 --> 01:08:28.629
- Oh, I'm not gloating.
- But I know what you're thinking.

01:08:28.729 --> 01:08:32.383
That I'm a fraud,
that I'm really losing my marbles.

01:08:32.483 --> 01:08:34.593
Are you sure you're all right?

01:08:34.693 --> 01:08:37.430
Betsy, I solemnly swear to you
I have flown this car.

01:08:37.529 --> 01:08:39.682
Oh, don't, darling.

01:08:39.782 --> 01:08:42.268
I'll take you home.
You get a good night's rest.

01:08:42.368 --> 01:08:43.978
Betsy, how can I...

01:08:44.078 --> 01:08:47.398
Wait a minute.
Why didn't I think to show this to them?

01:08:47.497 --> 01:08:50.125
I got so upset when the car wouldn't fly.
Here.

01:08:52.086 --> 01:08:54.629
Take this. Now, hold it out.

01:08:55.464 --> 01:08:56.464
Now, drop it.

01:09:00.553 --> 01:09:04.372
Flubber! That's how I was
able to bounce around in there.

01:09:04.473 --> 01:09:05.993
That's how we won the basketball game.

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:08.961
This is what makes the car fly.

01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:11.671
Are you sure you actually
made that car fly?

01:09:11.772 --> 01:09:13.231
This very car.

01:09:15.234 --> 01:09:18.179
No. No, I take that back.

01:09:18.279 --> 01:09:19.930
Well did you or didn't you?

01:09:20.029 --> 01:09:23.475
This isn't my car, Betsy.
My car had a radio in it.

01:09:23.576 --> 01:09:26.312
Somebody switched cars on me.

01:09:26.412 --> 01:09:27.604
- Hawk!
- Hawk?

01:09:27.705 --> 01:09:30.649
Alonzo Hawk. He saw me
flying the car last night,

01:09:30.749 --> 01:09:33.027
and he came to me to make
a deal, and I turned him down.

01:09:33.127 --> 01:09:35.029
- He stole my car.
- Are you sure?

01:09:35.129 --> 01:09:37.782
Will you stop saying that, Betsy?
Of course I'm sure.

01:09:37.881 --> 01:09:39.408
Please believe me.

01:09:39.508 --> 01:09:42.036
Now, we've got to get that car back.
In the hands of a man like Hawk...

01:09:42.136 --> 01:09:43.328
Ned, I believe you.

01:09:43.429 --> 01:09:45.763
Now, if we can only
figure out some way to...

01:09:47.933 --> 01:09:48.933
You what?

01:09:50.269 --> 01:09:51.435
I believe you.

01:09:52.770 --> 01:09:55.190
- You do?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:09:56.066 --> 01:09:57.400
Oh, Betsy.

01:09:57.693 --> 01:10:00.679
Well, I'm glad to see you came around
to my way of thinking, Professor.

01:10:00.779 --> 01:10:02.473
I'm with you one 100%, Mr. Hawk.

01:10:02.573 --> 01:10:06.034
Yes, I know, but we were discussing
the Model T. What's with these shoes?

01:10:06.619 --> 01:10:07.686
Flubber, Mr. Hawk.

01:10:07.786 --> 01:10:10.856
When you wear these flubberized
shoes, you'll have a spring in your step.

01:10:10.956 --> 01:10:12.525
You'll walk with your head
above the crowd.

01:10:12.625 --> 01:10:14.360
You'll live life to the fullest.

01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:17.780
And when the time comes, as the poet
says, to shuffle off this mortal coil,

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.115
you won't shuffle, Mr. Hawk.

01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:22.300
You'll go out with a hop,
a skip, a jump and a song in your heart.

01:10:22.927 --> 01:10:25.287
I still don't get it.
What about the Model T?

01:10:25.387 --> 01:10:28.541
Oh, Mr. Hawk.
Surely you can see the point.

01:10:28.641 --> 01:10:31.935
Why, shoes are 10 times
more valuable than a flying car.

01:10:32.478 --> 01:10:34.687
- How come?
- Well, figure it out.

01:10:35.272 --> 01:10:39.051
Only 8% of the world's
population buy cars.

01:10:39.151 --> 01:10:40.818
Practically everybody buys shoes!

01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:44.781
- You know, she's right.
- Sure she's right.

01:10:48.118 --> 01:10:49.895
- Now take it easy, Mr. Hawk.
- Huh?

01:10:49.995 --> 01:10:51.981
- I'll show you how the flubber works.
- Hmm?

01:10:52.081 --> 01:10:55.541
Now, just tap your heel on the floor.

01:10:58.128 --> 01:11:01.339
- You see?
- Yeah.

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:04.368
Well, I don't know if
I can hold my balance.

01:11:04.468 --> 01:11:07.246
Well, it just takes
a little getting used to, Mr. Hawk.

01:11:07.346 --> 01:11:09.623
Why, Ned's crazy about his.
Aren't you, dear?

01:11:09.723 --> 01:11:11.000
Oh yes, I certainly am.

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:13.252
I can't tell you the lift
I have gotten from them.

01:11:13.352 --> 01:11:16.187
Now, just jump up and down, Mr. Hawk.

01:11:16.605 --> 01:11:18.189
- Up and down?
- Uh-huh.

01:11:20.526 --> 01:11:23.304
There we go!

01:11:24.863 --> 01:11:28.157
Mr. Hawk, I think
that's high enough for right now.

01:11:28.617 --> 01:11:30.352
- Hold him down.
- That's fantastic.

01:11:30.452 --> 01:11:32.704
Hold him down. Hold him down, Betsy.

01:11:33.038 --> 01:11:35.357
There we are.
Now, wasn't that wonderful, Mr. Hawk?

01:11:35.457 --> 01:11:37.902
- Wonderful. Why did you stop me?
- We want to talk to you.

01:11:38.002 --> 01:11:40.522
You see, we know that you're interested
in more than just money.

01:11:40.587 --> 01:11:42.531
- Surely, you are.
- I am? What?

01:11:42.631 --> 01:11:45.659
Humanity, Mr. Hawk.
You can save lives with these shoes.

01:11:45.759 --> 01:11:46.785
Of course you can.

01:11:46.885 --> 01:11:51.123
Now, suppose, just suppose,
there's a fire, a raging fire.

01:11:51.223 --> 01:11:54.251
The stairs are a blazing inferno,
the smoke is billowing under the door.

01:11:54.351 --> 01:11:56.795
We're trapped! Help! Help! Help!

01:11:56.895 --> 01:11:59.548
The flames are creeping closer and closer.

01:11:59.648 --> 01:12:01.065
Oh, no, no, no.

01:12:01.233 --> 01:12:03.276
I can't stand it any longer.

01:12:03.402 --> 01:12:06.070
- Geronimo!
- My boy!

01:12:06.488 --> 01:12:08.072
Nothing to it, Mr. Hawk.

01:12:12.911 --> 01:12:15.580
- Why, that's amazing!
- Okay, your turn, Mr. Hawk.

01:12:15.873 --> 01:12:17.358
Oh, well, now. Just a minute.

01:12:17.458 --> 01:12:18.984
Oh, it's fun, Mr. Hawk!

01:12:19.084 --> 01:12:20.335
Go ahead.

01:12:20.586 --> 01:12:22.920
You'll land light as a thistle, Mr. Hawk.
I promise you.

01:12:23.922 --> 01:12:26.507
- Well, I don't know.
- Well, let me put it this way.

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:28.160
I certainly wouldn't want
to have a partner

01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:29.940
who doesn't have faith in his own product.

01:12:30.387 --> 01:12:34.041
Oh, you better do it.
He's very fussy about things like that.

01:12:34.141 --> 01:12:36.168
Well, nobody's
ever been able to call me a coward.

01:12:36.268 --> 01:12:38.436
Oh, I should say not, Mr. Hawk.

01:12:42.191 --> 01:12:45.485
Come on down, Mr. Hawk. One, two...

01:12:46.111 --> 01:12:48.180
- Well, I've changed my mind.
- Three!

01:12:55.412 --> 01:12:57.080
Whee! Hey, look!

01:12:57.456 --> 01:12:59.123
Look! I'm doing it!

01:12:59.666 --> 01:13:01.318
Sure you are, Mr. Hawk.

01:13:01.418 --> 01:13:02.987
Put a little more spring into it.

01:13:03.087 --> 01:13:05.505
See how simple it is? Flex your knees.

01:13:06.131 --> 01:13:08.701
That's right. Look at Mr. Hawk, dear.

01:13:08.801 --> 01:13:11.844
- Isn't he doing well?
- This is marvelous!

01:13:12.429 --> 01:13:14.206
Brainard, we've got something here.

01:13:14.306 --> 01:13:15.890
Sure we have, Mr. Hawk.

01:13:16.892 --> 01:13:19.977
Okay, I'm sold. Now, how do I stop?

01:13:20.729 --> 01:13:22.881
- What did he say, dear?
- I can't quite catch it.

01:13:22.981 --> 01:13:26.192
- I can't either.
- I said tell me how to stop.

01:13:26.693 --> 01:13:29.805
You can tell me something, Mr. Hawk.
What have you done with my car?

01:13:29.905 --> 01:13:32.933
- You tricked me!
- That's right, Mr. Hawk.

01:13:33.033 --> 01:13:35.368
Now, where is it? Where did you hide it?

01:13:36.078 --> 01:13:37.730
In my warehouse.

01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:40.190
- In his warehouse!
- Thanks, Mr. Hawk.

01:13:40.290 --> 01:13:43.793
- Hey! How do I stop?
- Happy landing, Mr. Hawk.

01:13:44.962 --> 01:13:46.671
Wait! Don't go!

01:13:46.964 --> 01:13:51.076
Professor Brainard, come back!
Don't leave me!

01:13:51.176 --> 01:13:54.429
Wait! Don't go! Uh, Biff!

01:13:54.847 --> 01:13:57.958
Biff, where are you?
It's your father calling.

01:13:58.058 --> 01:14:00.919
- Huh?
- Biff! Son, wake up!

01:14:01.019 --> 01:14:03.297
Get outta bed! Help your father!

01:14:03.397 --> 01:14:06.941
Hey! That's pretty neat, Pop.
How do you do that?

01:14:07.359 --> 01:14:09.527
Well, don't just lie there, you nitwit!

01:14:09.695 --> 01:14:11.638
Get somebody! Get the fire department!

01:14:11.738 --> 01:14:16.701
- Okay. All right. Don't blow a gasket.
- Stop me! Help!

01:14:21.123 --> 01:14:22.232
I don't get it.

01:14:22.332 --> 01:14:25.501
Why we gotta sit around
watchin' that crummy car?

01:14:26.545 --> 01:14:28.546
'Cause Hawk says so, that's why.

01:14:28.839 --> 01:14:31.325
You figure he knows what he's doing?

01:14:31.425 --> 01:14:34.760
Old fish eye didn't pile up all that loot
by being stupid, ya know what I mean?

01:14:49.109 --> 01:14:50.902
Here I go.

01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:56.725
No. I gotta go up higher.

01:14:56.825 --> 01:14:58.451
There we are.

01:15:20.599 --> 01:15:22.918
Looks like a lot of people
got behind in their payments.

01:15:23.018 --> 01:15:24.810
Dear, sweet Mr. Hawk.

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:27.605
Shh.

01:15:29.942 --> 01:15:32.177
- Lenny?
- Yeah, what?

01:15:32.277 --> 01:15:33.569
You hear noises?

01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:36.489
Like what kind of noises?

01:15:38.075 --> 01:15:39.617
Sorta like a...

01:15:42.246 --> 01:15:43.246
A harp?

01:15:47.918 --> 01:15:48.986
Now, let's see.

01:15:49.086 --> 01:15:51.613
Oh, no, no, no, now, Betsy.
Put it down, down.

01:15:51.713 --> 01:15:54.757
- Down.
- Easy. Easy.

01:15:59.930 --> 01:16:01.097
There.

01:16:05.143 --> 01:16:07.478
No. You better take my shoe off.

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:13.385
I, I can't get the knot undone.

01:16:13.485 --> 01:16:15.987
- Oh! My nail.
- Shh-shh.

01:16:16.697 --> 01:16:18.322
Maybe I can help you.

01:16:22.578 --> 01:16:23.911
There it goes again.

01:16:26.123 --> 01:16:27.498
You remember feisty McKenna?

01:16:29.084 --> 01:16:32.670
Only with him, it wasn't harp noises.
He kept hearing bird calls.

01:16:38.719 --> 01:16:40.720
Easy, easy, easy.

01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:45.266
Now, easy.

01:16:51.356 --> 01:16:52.440
Okay.

01:16:54.192 --> 01:16:55.969
Well... Ooh!

01:17:17.841 --> 01:17:21.052
Mr. Hawk! This is the fire chief speaking!

01:17:21.928 --> 01:17:24.805
We'll have everything under
control in just a moment.

01:17:25.599 --> 01:17:27.475
And, Mr. Hawk? Try to relax.

01:17:27.684 --> 01:17:30.561
Relax? How can I relax, you fathead!

01:17:30.896 --> 01:17:32.965
All the same, Mary Lou,
I wish you'd come over.

01:17:33.065 --> 01:17:35.274
Pop's putting on a great show.

01:17:36.193 --> 01:17:37.568
Oh, hold it. They're bringing in a net!

01:17:37.694 --> 01:17:39.570
Make way. Come on.

01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:43.140
Come down sitting. Not feet first!

01:17:46.661 --> 01:17:48.554
The net didn't work so well, Mary Lou.

01:17:49.081 --> 01:17:51.191
I told you we needed a new one.

01:17:51.291 --> 01:17:55.153
You told me? What do you think
I've been telling the town council?

01:17:55.253 --> 01:17:58.156
How am I supposed to buy a new net
without an appropriation?

01:17:58.256 --> 01:18:00.367
Well, don't get hot. I only mentioned it.

01:18:00.467 --> 01:18:03.036
Well, you just keep the kinks
out of the fire hose.

01:18:03.136 --> 01:18:05.080
That's all I want from you!

01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:07.323
I'm the chief.

01:18:08.517 --> 01:18:10.043
Sure! Come on over, Millie!

01:18:10.143 --> 01:18:12.183
You should see it!
Everybody's getting into the act.

01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:14.647
Don't worry, Mr. Hawk.
We'll take care of ya.

01:18:15.148 --> 01:18:16.774
No, don't do it! No!

01:18:19.403 --> 01:18:22.822
- Ow!
- Personally, I'm a dry fly man, myself.

01:18:23.448 --> 01:18:25.032
Royal coachman.

01:18:25.534 --> 01:18:27.618
- Oh, take it easy.
- I got him.

01:18:33.250 --> 01:18:36.919
Biff, help me!
Do something before they kill me.

01:18:37.295 --> 01:18:39.531
I know, Coach. I know you're
right in the middle of spring practice,

01:18:39.631 --> 01:18:41.173
but it's a matter of life and death.

01:18:54.396 --> 01:18:56.048
That ain't no bird call.

01:18:59.025 --> 01:19:01.928
Well, look who's here. It's the professor.

01:19:02.028 --> 01:19:04.238
Wasn't too smart
breakin' in like that, Professor.

01:19:04.656 --> 01:19:06.975
Well, I, I didn't exactly break in.

01:19:07.075 --> 01:19:09.285
Of course, as you can see,
I'm trying to break out.

01:19:11.747 --> 01:19:12.747
Careful, boys.

01:19:17.586 --> 01:19:18.878
Look!

01:19:20.964 --> 01:19:22.574
What happened, boys? You missed me.

01:19:22.674 --> 01:19:24.175
Here. Here I am.

01:19:25.802 --> 01:19:28.413
Now, take it easy, boys. Take it easy.

01:19:28.513 --> 01:19:32.475
Don't crowd me. I don't want to
have to get tough with you again.

01:19:40.567 --> 01:19:42.386
They're all fresh hot doggies!

01:19:42.486 --> 01:19:45.222
They're a foot long! Hot doggies!
Get your hot doggies!

01:19:45.322 --> 01:19:48.240
Right this way. Here you are, folks.
Hot dogs.

01:19:57.375 --> 01:19:59.486
And you were the lady
that called the police?

01:19:59.586 --> 01:20:02.280
Certainly.
I was getting ready to take a bath,

01:20:02.380 --> 01:20:05.174
and I saw this face
flashing past the window.

01:20:05.926 --> 01:20:08.245
Well, how did I know
the poor man was in trouble?

01:20:08.345 --> 01:20:10.971
Hey! Stand back!

01:20:11.389 --> 01:20:16.018
Well, sir, I calculate he gains
about 18 inches to bounce.

01:20:16.561 --> 01:20:18.187
And your opinion is?

01:20:19.314 --> 01:20:23.567
About 7:00 tonight,
he's going to be in serious trouble.

01:20:24.361 --> 01:20:27.806
Gosh!
My father never does anything like that.

01:20:27.906 --> 01:20:30.675
For a parent, he's way out.

01:20:31.243 --> 01:20:32.493
Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:20:39.125 --> 01:20:40.125
This way, fellas!

01:20:45.924 --> 01:20:47.842
Son, what are you going to do to me?

01:20:52.889 --> 01:20:55.333
One, two...

01:20:55.433 --> 01:20:57.685
Biff, I'm your father! Please!

01:20:58.019 --> 01:20:59.019
Hike!

01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:17.204
Pop! Are you all right, Pop?

01:21:18.456 --> 01:21:20.207
And why wouldn't I be?

01:21:20.792 --> 01:21:21.834
The warehouse!

01:21:30.302 --> 01:21:32.720
Oh, no.
Once more, and we'd have had it open.

01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:35.665
Come on. You're not
going to give up this easily, are you?

01:21:35.765 --> 01:21:37.685
Come on.
It's just a little old bump on the head.

01:21:37.767 --> 01:21:41.046
Here. That's it. Come on.
What would Mr. Hawk say?

01:21:41.146 --> 01:21:44.007
Come on. Let's get on our feet.
On with the fight. Come on.

01:21:44.907 --> 01:21:47.693
- Here. Try this.
- Oh. Thank you, dear.

01:21:50.989 --> 01:21:53.225
That did it.
Better get back in the car, Betsy.

01:21:54.492 --> 01:21:56.702
All right. Come on, you cut-rate gorillas.

01:21:58.997 --> 01:22:00.789
- Aim high this time.
- Got ya.

01:22:03.335 --> 01:22:05.377
Okay, Mr. Jumping Jack.

01:22:23.021 --> 01:22:24.688
Ned!

01:22:27.525 --> 01:22:29.860
Corners beautifully, doesn't it?

01:22:30.487 --> 01:22:31.487
Ned, look.

01:22:32.948 --> 01:22:34.031
Here they come.

01:22:40.413 --> 01:22:42.373
Come on, you guys. Get in the car!
Hurry up!

01:22:48.672 --> 01:22:53.592
To think I always thought of you
as a nice, easygoing college professor.

01:22:54.886 --> 01:22:56.637
- Betsy?
- Hmm?

01:22:57.013 --> 01:23:00.375
No. This is hardly the time or the place
to say what I was going to say.

01:23:00.475 --> 01:23:02.810
Oh, never mind. Go ahead. Say it.

01:23:03.395 --> 01:23:04.979
Well...

01:23:06.648 --> 01:23:09.066
Well, what do you know?
They want to play rough.

01:23:09.693 --> 01:23:12.903
- Here. Gimme that thing.
- You can't do that, Pop!

01:23:13.154 --> 01:23:15.906
We gotta show this nut we mean business.

01:23:25.166 --> 01:23:26.709
Well, looky there.

01:23:28.003 --> 01:23:31.255
A police car. Well, well, well.

01:23:40.223 --> 01:23:42.834
- Well, they've been asking for it.
- Asking for what?

01:23:42.934 --> 01:23:44.601
The Shelby stomp.

01:23:47.272 --> 01:23:48.272
It's Brainard.

01:23:58.783 --> 01:24:01.285
- Faster, son!
- I've got it down to the floor now.

01:24:14.883 --> 01:24:17.911
Hold it! All right. All right, you birds.

01:24:18.011 --> 01:24:20.288
Get your hands up on the top of that car.

01:24:20.388 --> 01:24:21.957
Now, see here, Officer.
This is ridiculous.

01:24:22.057 --> 01:24:23.640
Do you realize who I am?

01:24:24.809 --> 01:24:27.936
Yeah. You're the guy
who had this hot pistol in his mitt.

01:24:28.104 --> 01:24:32.441
I am Alonzo P. Hawk, President of
the Auld Lang Syne finance company.

01:24:34.152 --> 01:24:36.278
Isn't it a small world?

01:24:36.654 --> 01:24:38.723
Why, of course I remember you.

01:24:38.823 --> 01:24:40.016
Well, now, that's better.

01:24:40.116 --> 01:24:41.142
Sure.

01:24:41.242 --> 01:24:45.037
You're the outfit that repossessed
my electric icebox last year.

01:24:45.497 --> 01:24:48.191
Well, Officer Hanson, sorry to interrupt,

01:24:48.291 --> 01:24:51.001
but can you tell me
the shortest way to Washington, DC?

01:24:51.419 --> 01:24:53.989
Sure, Professor.
Down the block to the intersection.

01:24:54.089 --> 01:24:55.589
Left, Highway 9.

01:24:55.924 --> 01:25:00.010
- No, no. I mean as the crow flies.
- Oh! That way. Due east.

01:25:00.345 --> 01:25:01.845
Thanks.

01:25:02.472 --> 01:25:04.082
Officer, stop that man!

01:25:04.182 --> 01:25:07.585
He's flying off with millions of dollars
that rightfully belong to me!

01:25:07.685 --> 01:25:12.523
Mr. Hawk. Surely you're not
accusing dear old Professor...

01:25:25.870 --> 01:25:29.315
Sir, I have an unknown approaching
Washington prohibited zone.

01:25:29.415 --> 01:25:32.444
Heading, 068, angels, 1.5.

01:25:32.544 --> 01:25:35.613
- Speed, 45 knots.
- Forty-five knots. Are you sure?

01:25:35.713 --> 01:25:36.964
Yes, sir.

01:25:41.553 --> 01:25:45.290
Hello, Bird Form. This is Flag Down.
Scramble the five-minute birds.

01:25:50.353 --> 01:25:51.755
Attention. Attention.

01:25:51.855 --> 01:25:55.274
Scramble Bird Dog flight.
Scramble Bird Dog flight.

01:25:56.192 --> 01:25:59.695
Vector 270. Vector 270.

01:25:59.904 --> 01:26:04.241
Locate to angels 1.5. Angels 1.5.

01:26:51.647 --> 01:26:54.442
It's so lovely and peaceful up here,

01:26:54.542 --> 01:26:56.542
as though we were
the only two people in the world.

01:26:56.878 --> 01:26:58.670
Well, aren't we?

01:27:05.595 --> 01:27:07.163
Ned.

01:27:07.263 --> 01:27:08.555
Ned!

01:27:15.355 --> 01:27:17.715
- Did you see what I saw?
- I hope not.

01:27:17.815 --> 01:27:19.316
- Let's run that again.
- Roger.

01:27:21.611 --> 01:27:23.111
Here they come again!

01:27:24.822 --> 01:27:26.406
Let's get out of here!

01:27:32.121 --> 01:27:34.566
Hello, Flag Down. This is Bird Dog leader.

01:27:34.666 --> 01:27:36.541
I have a visual on that bogey.

01:27:36.751 --> 01:27:38.460
Well, speak up. What is it?

01:27:38.836 --> 01:27:41.338
I don't think
you're going to like this, sir.

01:27:41.798 --> 01:27:44.341
What's the matter with you?
Give me that bogey report.

01:27:44.550 --> 01:27:46.843
It's a Model T, sir.

01:27:47.011 --> 01:27:50.305
- A what?
- A Model T touring car.

01:27:50.431 --> 01:27:51.807
Only it's flying!

01:27:53.142 --> 01:27:56.812
Bird Dog leader, I suggest for your own
sake that you take another look.

01:27:59.524 --> 01:28:03.344
Well, I can't, sir.
It's gone into a cloud...

01:28:03.444 --> 01:28:04.987
And it won't come out.

01:28:07.407 --> 01:28:08.782
What's the procedure, sir?

01:28:10.576 --> 01:28:12.619
I think I'll let the colonel
handle this one.

01:28:12.870 --> 01:28:14.538
Yes, Flag Down?

01:28:15.331 --> 01:28:17.374
Well, go on, Captain. Go on.

01:28:19.085 --> 01:28:20.627
A flying what?

01:28:21.754 --> 01:28:23.880
Cut the clowning, Flag Down.
The CO's here.

01:28:24.215 --> 01:28:26.117
- What's going on, Colonel?
- Nothing, sir.

01:28:26.217 --> 01:28:27.744
What do you mean, "Nothing"?

01:28:27.844 --> 01:28:30.205
It's Flag Down, sir.
Just a little question of procedure.

01:28:30.305 --> 01:28:31.305
Give me that.

01:28:32.598 --> 01:28:35.335
What's all this about procedure?
Don't you know your job, man?

01:28:35.435 --> 01:28:36.893
Don't interrupt me.

01:28:39.063 --> 01:28:41.466
It might interest you to know
the general's staff

01:28:41.566 --> 01:28:44.886
has worked out exact procedure
for every possible situation.

01:28:44.986 --> 01:28:46.903
There's nothing could happen that...

01:28:48.948 --> 01:28:50.407
A flying what?

01:29:03.755 --> 01:29:05.422
- Looks like they've gone.
- Good.

01:29:05.757 --> 01:29:08.826
Can we get out of here now?
This is ruining my hair set.

01:29:08.926 --> 01:29:10.566
Darling, you never looked more beautiful.

01:29:14.390 --> 01:29:16.834
Gentlemen, it's quite simple, really.

01:29:16.934 --> 01:29:19.212
Obviously, a Model T cannot fly.

01:29:19.312 --> 01:29:21.881
Therefore, it must be
something disguised as a Model T.

01:29:21.981 --> 01:29:25.734
I am declaring a condition yellow.
Let's move, Colonel.

01:29:39.457 --> 01:29:40.957
How lovely it is.

01:29:41.459 --> 01:29:44.028
It makes you feel proud, doesn't it?

01:29:44.128 --> 01:29:46.406
Washington's a great city.

01:29:46.506 --> 01:29:47.986
There's something there for everyone.

01:29:58.476 --> 01:30:00.602
Look at all those people down there.

01:30:01.437 --> 01:30:04.882
- I think they're staring at us.
- I wouldn't be a bit surprised.

01:30:04.982 --> 01:30:06.718
I can't hear what
they're yelling, can you?

01:30:06.818 --> 01:30:08.944
Hi, down there!

01:30:09.237 --> 01:30:11.154
Oh, Ned! Look out!

01:30:16.577 --> 01:30:19.162
Kind of hits you between the eyes,
doesn't it?

01:30:22.667 --> 01:30:25.236
Look! There's Grant's Tomb.

01:30:25.336 --> 01:30:27.363
I, uh, think Grant's Tomb
is in New York, dear.

01:30:27.463 --> 01:30:29.073
I believe that's the Jefferson Memorial.

01:30:29.173 --> 01:30:31.091
Oh, you mean Monticello.

01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:39.917
Betsy, I think there's a touring map
in the side pocket.

01:30:40.017 --> 01:30:42.477
Will you see
if you can find the Pentagon building?

01:30:46.899 --> 01:30:49.693
It has five sides and a big parking lot.

01:30:50.278 --> 01:30:52.096
I doubt if it's on here, dear.

01:30:52.196 --> 01:30:54.766
This map is from the year 1917!

01:31:02.081 --> 01:31:04.875
Oh, there's the Capitol. Won't that do?

01:31:05.626 --> 01:31:06.877
The Capitol.

01:31:07.462 --> 01:31:10.198
Gosh, Betsy, when you think of
all the history that was made there.

01:31:10.298 --> 01:31:13.493
Now, don't forget.
You're making history right now.

01:31:13.593 --> 01:31:17.038
Oh, you think so?
I hope they don't make a fuss over me.

01:31:17.138 --> 01:31:20.249
We interrupt this program
to bring you an emergency bulletin.

01:31:20.349 --> 01:31:21.766
This is the commanding officer,

01:31:21.934 --> 01:31:26.563
sector air defense, speaking on
all commercial and military wavelengths.

01:31:26.856 --> 01:31:31.943
Attention, an unidentified
flying object is over the city.

01:31:32.737 --> 01:31:35.515
- I don't see anything. Do you?
- No!

01:31:35.615 --> 01:31:37.365
Nothing up here but us.

01:31:37.909 --> 01:31:40.436
- Every defensive missile in the area...
- Us!

01:31:40.536 --> 01:31:43.038
Is trained on the flying object.

01:31:43.331 --> 01:31:48.293
If it does not identify itself,
it will be shot down immediately.

01:31:48.503 --> 01:31:51.197
- They wouldn't dare!
- Oh, yes. They'd, they'd dare.

01:31:51.297 --> 01:31:53.616
This is your last warning.

01:31:53.716 --> 01:31:56.760
Identify yourself, or we will open fire.

01:31:57.470 --> 01:32:01.389
- Ready at Fort Meade?
- Missile battery's locked on target, sir.

01:32:02.308 --> 01:32:07.145
Repeat. Are you listening,
unidentified flying object?

01:32:08.773 --> 01:32:10.607
We are waiting for your response.

01:32:11.150 --> 01:32:14.152
I am responding! I'm Professor Brainard!

01:32:15.363 --> 01:32:17.948
At the count of 10, we open fire.

01:32:18.407 --> 01:32:21.144
Don't bother to count, General.
I'm an American.

01:32:21.244 --> 01:32:23.161
- Two...
- See? My credit cards.

01:32:23.621 --> 01:32:24.663
Three,

01:32:26.624 --> 01:32:27.624
four,

01:32:28.125 --> 01:32:30.862
- Wait, General!
- You're not gonna stand for that, are you?

01:32:30.962 --> 01:32:33.171
- Five...
- Yes.

01:32:34.924 --> 01:32:35.924
Six,

01:32:37.510 --> 01:32:38.510
seven...

01:32:39.136 --> 01:32:42.180
Sir, Fort Meade reports
he's gone behind the Capitol dome.

01:32:43.808 --> 01:32:45.710
- Eight...
- Sir, Congress is in session.

01:32:45.810 --> 01:32:49.062
If you fire, we might
lose every senator and congressman.

01:32:52.108 --> 01:32:53.191
Nine...

01:32:54.652 --> 01:32:57.821
And they've just put a new front
on the building.

01:33:04.161 --> 01:33:05.745
Hold your fire.

01:33:06.998 --> 01:33:09.484
Well, why try to pass the buck to me?

01:33:09.584 --> 01:33:11.360
Just because it looks like a...

01:33:11.460 --> 01:33:12.460
What?

01:33:13.504 --> 01:33:15.024
Well, I don't care if it is a Model T.

01:33:16.173 --> 01:33:18.493
Shoot it down! Right. Right.

01:33:18.593 --> 01:33:23.372
And if you happen to see a Stutz Bearcat
or a Pope Toledo flying over the Capitol,

01:33:23.472 --> 01:33:25.265
shoot them down too.

01:33:31.355 --> 01:33:37.011
As a personal favor,
won't you please identify yourself?

01:33:38.696 --> 01:33:40.681
Professor, this is the admiral speaking.

01:33:40.781 --> 01:33:42.934
Proceed directly to
Anacostia Naval Air Station...

01:33:43.034 --> 01:33:44.435
This is your old friend General Singer.

01:33:44.535 --> 01:33:46.354
Now, you fly right over
to Bolling Air Force Base...

01:33:46.454 --> 01:33:47.454
This is the Army.

01:33:47.538 --> 01:33:51.175
- Report to Fort Myer.
- Anacostia naval air station.

01:33:55.921 --> 01:33:57.881
Now, hear this!

01:33:59.508 --> 01:34:00.750
Anacostia.

01:34:02.595 --> 01:34:05.122
They had their chance.
I'm not gonna fool around any longer.

01:34:05.222 --> 01:34:07.291
- Ned, what are you doing?
- We're going to land

01:34:07.391 --> 01:34:09.460
on that big patch of green lawn.

01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:11.712
- Oh, Ned. Not there, please!
- Why not?

01:34:11.812 --> 01:34:14.564
My hair, it's a mess,
and I haven't a thing to wear.

01:34:18.861 --> 01:34:20.596
Anybody home?

01:34:20.696 --> 01:34:21.696
Ned!

01:34:28.621 --> 01:34:32.024
This way, Professor. Please.
Explain what the President said.

01:34:34.418 --> 01:34:36.862
Professor, what did
the President have to say?

01:34:36.962 --> 01:34:37.962
Well...

01:34:38.047 --> 01:34:40.700
The President, devoted
as always, to the advance of science,

01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:44.370
has embraced the discovery of flubber
with tremendous enthusiasm.

01:34:44.470 --> 01:34:46.539
Uh, Professor, what branch
of the armed services

01:34:46.639 --> 01:34:49.015
will be given control
of your new discovery?

01:34:49.892 --> 01:34:51.919
- Well...
- All will share alike.

01:34:52.019 --> 01:34:55.881
In our opinion, flubber will only
cement the great, traditional ties

01:34:55.981 --> 01:34:57.732
of inter-service cooperation.

01:34:58.109 --> 01:35:00.845
Professor, with this great
breakthrough in science,

01:35:00.945 --> 01:35:03.279
do you feel you still have
other worlds to conquer?

01:35:03.781 --> 01:35:05.057
I do.

01:35:05.157 --> 01:35:09.077
Just so there's no doubt about it,
would you mind repeating that?

01:35:10.371 --> 01:35:11.606
I do.

01:35:11.706 --> 01:35:15.860
With pleasure, and a deep sense
of accomplishment,

01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:19.838
I now pronounce you man and wife.

01:35:26.303 --> 01:35:27.303
Oh!

01:35:28.139 --> 01:35:31.125
Brickabracker, soda cracker,

01:35:31.225 --> 01:35:33.377
sis-boom-bah!

01:35:33.477 --> 01:35:36.855
Married, married, rah-rah-rah!

01:35:43.779 --> 01:35:46.122
- Good-bye, Betsy.
- Good luck!
