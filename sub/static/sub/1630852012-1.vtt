WEBVTT

00:07.563 --> 00:10.396
(projector whirs)

00:55.670 --> 00:57.750
- I should've never let you in here.

00:57.750 --> 01:00.233
- You shouldn't have gotten
mixed in with those guys.

01:02.010 --> 01:03.283
What are you afraid of?

01:14.409 --> 01:16.379
(gun fires)
(Fay grunts)

01:16.379 --> 01:19.629
(serene country music)

03:06.770 --> 03:08.930
- Why'd you leave so early?

03:08.930 --> 03:10.523
I wanted to make you breakfast.

03:11.990 --> 03:15.763
Yeah, I know, I'll be able to
make you breakfast every day.

03:18.460 --> 03:21.453
Yeah, no, me, I gotta go
pick up my assignment.

03:22.390 --> 03:25.190
I'm not sure yet, but
I'm hoping it's not far.

03:25.190 --> 03:28.513
You know, L.A. traffic
is already a nightmare.

03:30.980 --> 03:33.313
Okay, babe, I'll see you tonight?

03:34.970 --> 03:35.803
Love you too.

03:37.653 --> 03:38.704
Bye.

03:47.661 --> 03:50.244
(somber music)

04:54.079 --> 04:57.246
(radio static buzzes)

05:03.733 --> 05:06.882
- [Anchor] The country is in
a complete civil race war.

05:06.882 --> 05:10.019
(police sirens wail)
(guns fire)

05:10.019 --> 05:12.220
- Is someone shooting?

05:12.220 --> 05:13.362
(gun fires)
(Fay screams)

05:13.362 --> 05:17.200
God, move, move!
(tires screech)

05:17.200 --> 05:19.533
(guns fire)

05:24.566 --> 05:25.421
Not again.
(gun fires)

05:25.421 --> 05:30.004
(Fay yelps)
(crashing)

05:49.389 --> 05:51.889
(tense music)

05:55.584 --> 05:57.917
(men grunt)

06:03.376 --> 06:06.459
(police sirens wail)

06:11.785 --> 06:13.046
Call me back, call me back, I need you!

06:13.046 --> 06:15.940
(man shouts)
I'm downtown near 10th!

06:15.940 --> 06:18.023
(grunts)

06:27.871 --> 06:30.871
(suspenseful music)

06:59.950 --> 07:02.440
(locks click)

07:02.440 --> 07:04.630
Hey, hey.

07:04.630 --> 07:06.200
I hear you, somebody in there?

07:06.200 --> 07:07.033
Somebody?

07:11.138 --> 07:14.555
(helicopter blades whir)

07:25.330 --> 07:26.621
(foreboding music)

07:26.621 --> 07:27.767
(knocking)

07:27.767 --> 07:28.667
- [Man] Yo, bitch!

07:30.080 --> 07:32.457
Yo, bitch, I know you in there!

07:33.580 --> 07:35.150
I hear you!

07:35.150 --> 07:36.350
I'm coming for your ass!

07:38.820 --> 07:40.700
Yeah, we'll be back!

08:31.796 --> 08:34.963
(newscaster chatters)

08:39.710 --> 08:40.933
- What the fuck?

08:42.374 --> 08:47.374
(people shout)
(guns fire)

08:47.534 --> 08:49.670
- [Man] Let's go, cover your head!

08:49.670 --> 08:50.893
- They finally did it.

08:52.260 --> 08:54.520
- Who finally did what?

08:54.520 --> 08:55.670
- This has been coming.

08:56.960 --> 08:59.973
For anybody listening, watching.

09:01.370 --> 09:02.420
This has been coming.

09:04.129 --> 09:08.611
(helicopter blades whir)
(woman screams)

09:08.611 --> 09:10.944
(gun fires)

09:17.023 --> 09:18.560
- I have to see what's going on.

09:18.560 --> 09:19.790
My car is out there.

09:19.790 --> 09:21.660
- You know what's going on.

09:21.660 --> 09:23.163
You were already out there.

09:24.270 --> 09:25.563
Just getting worse.

09:27.631 --> 09:30.548
(dial tone blares)

09:32.410 --> 09:34.323
- [Fay] Do you have a phone I could use?

09:35.360 --> 09:36.863
- Stopped working an hour ago.

09:39.640 --> 09:42.070
- Well is there another way out of here?

09:42.070 --> 09:43.120
What about that door?

09:44.600 --> 09:45.803
- It's just storage.

09:48.110 --> 09:50.460
This is the safest place
in the city right now.

09:53.010 --> 09:55.490
- [Fay] What are you, some kind of artist?

09:55.490 --> 09:57.660
- Bingo, what gave me away?

09:57.660 --> 09:59.600
All my dirty paintbrushes?

09:59.600 --> 10:01.780
Or my high fashion wardrobe?

10:01.780 --> 10:04.930
- What's a white girl
doing living down here?

10:04.930 --> 10:06.280
You slumming?

10:06.280 --> 10:09.030
- Till my splashes of color
can actually make me money,

10:09.890 --> 10:11.940
warehouse in the hood is
all a white girl can afford.

10:11.940 --> 10:14.164
- We just heard a big explosion.

10:14.164 --> 10:16.000
(guns fire)
Not more than a block

10:16.000 --> 10:17.060
away from us.

10:17.060 --> 10:20.740
And a gang of men, a gang of armed men

10:20.740 --> 10:22.970
have been going back and
forth from each other.

10:22.970 --> 10:25.576
There's been looting everywhere.

10:25.576 --> 10:26.730
(people shout angrily)

10:26.730 --> 10:29.390
This is Fabia Lopez, back
to you at the studio.

10:29.390 --> 10:30.616
Let's get out of here.

10:30.616 --> 10:32.949
(gun fires)

10:33.944 --> 10:35.804
(static buzzes)

10:35.804 --> 10:38.721
(foreboding music)

11:05.641 --> 11:08.558
(car alarm blares)

11:10.470 --> 11:13.370
- Might as well make
ourselves comfortable.

11:13.370 --> 11:15.040
There's not much we can do.

11:15.040 --> 11:16.183
Just ride it out.

11:17.060 --> 11:19.610
- This is not just some
wave that will come and go.

11:20.830 --> 11:22.990
- No, you're right.

11:22.990 --> 11:25.540
Like all waves, there'll
be another one after this.

11:26.600 --> 11:27.950
And another one after that.

11:29.570 --> 11:31.120
- You don't look like a surfer.

11:32.290 --> 11:33.123
- I'm not.

11:34.010 --> 11:36.260
Just a student of history
and human behavior.

11:53.594 --> 11:56.261
(ominous music)

12:01.930 --> 12:03.333
Called some of my friends.

12:04.580 --> 12:05.930
They should be here by now.

12:08.400 --> 12:10.950
- Thought you said the
phone stopped working.

12:10.950 --> 12:11.783
- It did.

12:12.810 --> 12:14.260
I talked to him this morning.

12:16.670 --> 12:18.103
They're coming in from out of town.

12:40.027 --> 12:43.027
(men shout angrily)

12:46.430 --> 12:50.763
(gun fires)
(gasps)

13:00.534 --> 13:03.451
(melancholy music)

13:11.791 --> 13:13.291
- We did it, Pops.

13:18.470 --> 13:19.793
I got my badge today.

13:22.430 --> 13:23.263
Yeah.

13:28.890 --> 13:30.510
I know you always wanted a boy

13:31.840 --> 13:33.733
to follow in the family legacy.

13:36.920 --> 13:38.623
But I guess it was me, huh?

13:44.400 --> 13:49.243
And I promise I'm gonna be
the best cop you ever saw.

13:54.960 --> 13:56.080
(sobs)
- We should stay away

13:56.080 --> 13:57.193
from the windows.

13:58.890 --> 14:00.339
We don't want anyone to see us.

14:00.339 --> 14:01.610
- No.

14:01.610 --> 14:04.610
We can't just sit here and do nothing.

14:04.610 --> 14:06.630
We have to do--
- What?

14:06.630 --> 14:07.740
We have to what?

14:08.750 --> 14:11.190
The world is on fire.

14:11.190 --> 14:13.520
If we go out there, we'll burn with it.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.320
- Well you might be okay with just sitting

14:15.320 --> 14:17.573
and watching it burn, but I'm not.

14:18.450 --> 14:20.193
- There's nothing we can do.

14:22.150 --> 14:25.510
Who do you think you are,
some kind of wonder woman?

14:25.510 --> 14:26.870
- No.

14:26.870 --> 14:29.497
I'm a--
(phone rings)

14:35.660 --> 14:37.623
Ric, where are you?

14:39.580 --> 14:41.670
I'm okay, I'm...

14:41.670 --> 14:42.850
I don't even know what happened.

14:42.850 --> 14:46.023
I was leaving downtown from
work when everything happened.

14:47.410 --> 14:49.460
Yes, yes, I'm safe right now, I'm...

14:51.170 --> 14:53.710
I'm in a warehouse building near Central.

14:53.710 --> 14:54.943
What's the address here?

14:56.020 --> 14:58.170
- There's no address outside.

14:58.170 --> 15:00.770
Just middle of the
block on 14th, red door.

15:00.770 --> 15:03.060
- Middle of the block on 14th, red door.

15:03.060 --> 15:04.160
I'll look out for you.

15:08.790 --> 15:10.350
What's going on?

15:10.350 --> 15:12.710
I can't see anything.

15:12.710 --> 15:14.350
This is crazy.

15:14.350 --> 15:16.020
I mean, they always said
something like this would happen,

15:16.020 --> 15:17.760
but I never thought...

15:24.360 --> 15:27.830
Just be safe and get
here as fast as you can.

15:27.830 --> 15:29.270
Okay?

15:29.270 --> 15:31.820
Okay, I love you.

15:31.820 --> 15:34.364
(dial tone blares)

15:34.364 --> 15:35.197
Fuck.

15:38.700 --> 15:40.550
- I think there's somebody out there.

15:41.432 --> 15:43.000
- What are you talking about?

15:43.000 --> 15:45.563
- I think I see somebody,
but I'm not sure.

15:45.563 --> 15:48.646
(police siren wails)

16:17.260 --> 16:18.310
- It's a little girl.

16:20.090 --> 16:21.143
- Is she alive?

16:22.530 --> 16:23.961
- I don't know.

16:23.961 --> 16:25.190
(helicopter blades whir)

16:25.190 --> 16:26.190
I'm going out there.

16:28.820 --> 16:30.550
Go to the window and look out for me.

16:30.550 --> 16:33.623
If you see something,
you see anyone, yell out.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.050
Can you open the door for me?

16:38.835 --> 16:39.785
I'll be right back.

16:49.450 --> 16:50.283
Hey.

16:54.250 --> 16:55.083
Hey.

16:58.810 --> 16:59.643
You all right?

17:05.022 --> 17:06.222
(booming)

17:06.222 --> 17:09.323
(hisses) Are you hurt?

17:09.323 --> 17:10.156
Fuck.

17:20.475 --> 17:22.475
(gasps)

17:24.437 --> 17:27.336
(man breathes heavily)

17:27.336 --> 17:29.707
- I always wanted myself a black--

17:29.707 --> 17:32.096
(gun fires)
(yelps)

17:32.096 --> 17:33.790
(tense music)

17:33.790 --> 17:35.730
- [Man] Now you're next.

17:35.730 --> 17:38.940
Can't run from me!

17:38.940 --> 17:40.920
I see, no, I'm not there!

17:40.920 --> 17:42.439
Am I there?

17:42.439 --> 17:45.439
I'm everywhere!

17:47.001 --> 17:51.251
You can't hide from me, I see you!

17:52.268 --> 17:54.768
(man screams)

17:56.071 --> 17:56.904
You!

18:50.039 --> 18:52.539
(tense music)

18:59.602 --> 19:02.048
(metal clatters)

19:02.048 --> 19:06.631
(thudding)
(man yelps)

19:36.030 --> 19:39.447
(helicopter blades whir)

19:55.095 --> 19:58.428
(emergency sirens wail)

20:07.162 --> 20:08.820
- Nova, it's me!

20:08.820 --> 20:10.274
It's me, let me in!

20:10.274 --> 20:11.243
(knocking)
Nova!

20:12.290 --> 20:14.063
Need you to let me in, please!

20:15.170 --> 20:16.090
Now, now!

20:17.590 --> 20:19.040
I know you're afraid, please.

20:21.124 --> 20:21.957
Please.

20:22.900 --> 20:24.463
Please, please.

20:39.150 --> 20:41.180
- You all right, sister?

20:41.180 --> 20:42.600
- Yeah.

20:42.600 --> 20:44.323
Yeah, I'm all right.

20:54.030 --> 20:55.383
- Good.

20:55.383 --> 20:58.033
I saw that motherfucker
trying to go after you.

20:58.033 --> 21:00.263
But we ain't having
that today, not no more.

21:01.350 --> 21:03.193
We cleaning house today.

21:04.330 --> 21:06.230
Getting rid of all those white devils.

21:16.680 --> 21:18.143
You alone in here, sister?

21:21.130 --> 21:21.963
- Yeah.

21:22.960 --> 21:23.923
This is my studio.

21:24.800 --> 21:27.620
You read a lot, that's good.

21:27.620 --> 21:30.670
We need smart black women
to raise our children.

21:30.670 --> 21:32.120
The white devils have been poisoning them

21:32.120 --> 21:33.113
with lies about us.

21:52.725 --> 21:56.045
(guns fire)
(emergency sirens wail)

21:56.045 --> 21:57.376
- Yo, Adisa!

21:57.376 --> 21:58.810
Yo, man.

21:58.810 --> 22:00.913
Yo, dog, come on, man.

22:02.550 --> 22:04.590
They coming, man, come on, bro.

22:04.590 --> 22:05.423
They coming!

22:15.160 --> 22:16.310
- Come with us, sister.

22:17.410 --> 22:20.063
We ain't free yet, there's a
lot of fighting to be done.

22:21.080 --> 22:21.913
- No.

22:22.796 --> 22:23.796
I'm gonna stay here.

22:24.700 --> 22:26.120
- Yo, man!

22:26.120 --> 22:26.953
Come on!

22:39.770 --> 22:41.660
- You can breathe now.

22:41.660 --> 22:42.493
They're gone.

22:45.200 --> 22:46.033
- I'm sorry.

22:47.790 --> 22:49.440
I don't know what happened to me.

22:50.540 --> 22:51.860
I froze.

22:51.860 --> 22:52.693
- Forget it.

22:57.110 --> 22:58.890
- What about the little girl?

22:58.890 --> 23:00.993
- It wasn't real, it was a doll.

23:03.480 --> 23:04.313
- A doll?

23:05.440 --> 23:06.980
- Forget it.

23:06.980 --> 23:08.880
We've got other things to worry about.

23:11.260 --> 23:12.510
It's gonna get dark soon.

23:13.650 --> 23:16.200
And things are probably
only gonna get a lot worse.

23:17.140 --> 23:17.973
Come on.

23:20.045 --> 23:22.795
(dramatic music)

23:55.819 --> 23:59.078
(people shout)

23:59.078 --> 24:02.161
(electricity buzzes)

24:05.480 --> 24:06.313
Oh great.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.930
Somebody must have cut the lines.

24:11.633 --> 24:13.108
(phone rings)

24:13.108 --> 24:14.747
(ominous music)

24:14.747 --> 24:17.230
I thought you said...

24:17.230 --> 24:18.530
- They must have fixed it.

24:26.438 --> 24:29.889
- [Lestor] Nova. (chatters)

24:29.889 --> 24:30.972
- Yes, but...

24:33.445 --> 24:35.190
It's not a problem, she's...

24:38.237 --> 24:39.070
Okay.

24:40.699 --> 24:41.532
Okay.

24:43.230 --> 24:44.280
I'll do what you say.

24:52.340 --> 24:55.390
Good news, friends are all right.

24:55.390 --> 24:56.940
Just taking longer to get here.

25:22.598 --> 25:24.674
- Pick up, pick up.

25:24.674 --> 25:26.946
(dial tone blares)

25:26.946 --> 25:27.779
Damn.

25:33.023 --> 25:34.795
What do we do now?

25:34.795 --> 25:37.462
(ominous music)

25:49.437 --> 25:52.687
(serene country music)

26:04.375 --> 26:05.486
- You're kidding.

26:07.710 --> 26:08.543
- Oh my god.

26:29.313 --> 26:31.390
- I don't feel like drinking.

26:31.390 --> 26:32.333
- Oh, come on.

26:33.240 --> 26:35.390
It's the end of everything
we know outside.

26:36.320 --> 26:38.320
You and I should both be dead right now.

26:43.530 --> 26:45.030
That's at least worth a drink.

26:47.560 --> 26:48.660
- Okay, fine.

26:48.660 --> 26:50.360
Give me it, you talked me into it.

26:54.510 --> 26:55.343
- Cheers.

26:56.410 --> 26:57.243
- Cheers.

27:12.424 --> 27:13.970
- [Nova] You got somewhere to be?

27:13.970 --> 27:14.803
- Yes.

27:16.020 --> 27:16.970
No, I...

27:19.770 --> 27:21.320
I was going to visit my father.

27:22.350 --> 27:23.450
He gave me this watch.

27:28.060 --> 27:30.673
I was going to visit his
grave to tell him something.

27:32.750 --> 27:33.800
- Your father's dead?

27:35.964 --> 27:37.590
- Yeah.

27:37.590 --> 27:38.423
Three years now.

27:41.730 --> 27:44.133
When he gave me this watch, he said,

27:46.407 --> 27:49.487
"There's always time
to do the right thing."

27:52.160 --> 27:54.360
I try to remember that
when times get tough.

27:56.956 --> 27:58.756
- What were you gonna tell your dad?

28:00.180 --> 28:01.013
- What?

28:02.000 --> 28:03.790
- You said that you were
on the way to the cemetery

28:03.790 --> 28:05.290
to tell your father something.

28:06.410 --> 28:07.243
What was it?

28:11.230 --> 28:13.230
- You don't seem worried about all this.

28:14.130 --> 28:17.753
I mean, it's like you said,
it is the end of the world.

28:18.920 --> 28:19.943
Don't you care?

28:20.990 --> 28:21.853
- I care.

28:23.280 --> 28:25.130
There'll be something after all this.

28:29.591 --> 28:32.270
- Is that what it says
in "The White Wave"?

28:32.270 --> 28:33.820
- [Nova] What?

28:33.820 --> 28:36.633
- The book on the table.

28:38.890 --> 28:40.690
- It's just a book a friend gave me.

28:41.700 --> 28:43.393
I know a lot of crazy people.

28:45.910 --> 28:50.043
Lestor, he's got a lot of
crazy ideas about the world.

28:51.350 --> 28:53.480
- This the same friend that's on the way?

28:53.480 --> 28:55.160
- [Nova] Who, Lestor?

28:55.160 --> 28:56.390
Yeah.

28:56.390 --> 28:57.463
Him and some others.

28:59.290 --> 29:01.713
- Some others with crazy ideas?

29:02.570 --> 29:04.380
- You ask a lot of questions.

29:04.380 --> 29:05.273
You a cop?

29:17.100 --> 29:18.400
- [Fay] What's in the van?

29:19.500 --> 29:22.083
- I don't know, cleaning supplies?

29:23.140 --> 29:24.423
It belongs to Lestor.

29:25.460 --> 29:28.153
That's why he's coming, to pick it up.

29:30.610 --> 29:32.550
- Must be something pretty important

29:32.550 --> 29:34.707
to drive through a war to pick up a van.

29:43.514 --> 29:45.375
(heart thumps)

29:45.375 --> 29:47.875
(tense music)

29:49.404 --> 29:52.071
- You should've never came here.

30:03.916 --> 30:07.499
- What's in the van, Nova?

30:11.085 --> 30:13.585
You put something in my drink?

30:18.655 --> 30:19.488
Why?

30:24.773 --> 30:25.606
Why?

30:29.095 --> 30:29.928
Why?

30:31.546 --> 30:33.629
Why, why did you do this?

30:52.567 --> 30:55.484
(foreboding music)

31:20.024 --> 31:21.691
- What have we here?

31:23.465 --> 31:25.882
She's still breathing.

31:30.757 --> 31:31.590
Love.

31:36.026 --> 31:36.943
Well, shit.

31:38.168 --> 31:40.800
- Man, stay out of it--

31:40.800 --> 31:42.480
- Come on, man, this is the time--

31:42.480 --> 31:44.129
- Don't you fucking touch--

31:44.129 --> 31:46.580
- Whoa, what is your problem, man?

31:46.580 --> 31:49.830
Don't fucking touch me, don't touch me.

31:50.801 --> 31:55.358
- You find some rope, I
want you to guys tie her up,

31:55.358 --> 31:56.918
set her off to the side,

31:56.918 --> 31:58.870
we'll figure out what
to do with her later.

31:58.870 --> 32:01.700
Right now we gotta get our shit together,

32:01.700 --> 32:04.678
cause we got somewhere to be, don't we?

32:04.678 --> 32:06.340
- Go grab the rope, man.

32:06.340 --> 32:08.944
He told you to get the rope, dumb.

32:08.944 --> 32:12.027
(slow motion speech)

32:17.436 --> 32:20.103
(ominous music)

32:23.754 --> 32:25.754
(gasps)

32:43.935 --> 32:46.980
(sighs)
- Baby?

32:46.980 --> 32:48.430
What's wrong, couldn't sleep?

32:50.140 --> 32:51.943
Must've been thinking about me, huh?

32:51.943 --> 32:53.893
- (giggles) Shut up.

32:56.310 --> 32:57.350
No, I...

32:58.520 --> 33:01.003
I just had the craziest dream.

33:03.525 --> 33:04.873
I can't even remember.

33:08.240 --> 33:09.323
I was alone,

33:11.530 --> 33:15.263
and I kept calling you,
but you weren't there.

33:16.575 --> 33:17.575
- Well I'm here now.

33:18.510 --> 33:20.527
What was it that you wanted?

33:21.634 --> 33:22.775
- What?

33:22.775 --> 33:25.030
- In your dream, you
said you were calling me.

33:25.030 --> 33:26.080
All right, here I am.

33:27.080 --> 33:27.913
What'd you want?

33:30.040 --> 33:31.890
- I...

33:31.890 --> 33:33.113
I can't remember.

33:40.840 --> 33:41.753
- I got an idea.

33:44.143 --> 33:44.976
- What?

33:44.976 --> 33:47.923
- I was kinda planning
this for another time.

33:50.260 --> 33:53.393
This kinda seems like the
right time, right place.

34:01.341 --> 34:03.674
(Fay sighs)

34:04.890 --> 34:07.340
Just a picture, I'm always
here when you need me.

34:08.600 --> 34:10.400
In your dreams or when you're awake.

34:11.950 --> 34:15.915
Fay, will you do me the
honor of being my wife?

34:15.915 --> 34:18.498
(gentle music)

34:20.062 --> 34:21.984
- Yes. (laughs)

34:21.984 --> 34:23.303
- Yes?

34:23.303 --> 34:24.303
- [Fay] Yes.

34:25.281 --> 34:26.114
Yes.

34:27.714 --> 34:28.797
- Yes?
- Yeah.

34:30.163 --> 34:31.493
Yes.
- You gonna put it on,

34:31.493 --> 34:33.784
or you just gonna look at it?
- I don't know. (laughs)

34:33.784 --> 34:35.284
I don't even know.

34:36.323 --> 34:41.323
Oh.

34:42.475 --> 34:45.281
I love you.
- I love you.

34:45.281 --> 34:47.781
(Fay giggles)

35:18.591 --> 35:19.424
- Oh, god.

35:26.403 --> 35:28.403
(gasps)

35:35.093 --> 35:37.343
(whimpers)

35:51.642 --> 35:54.225
(grunts) Fuck.

35:55.714 --> 35:57.797
(groans)

36:01.330 --> 36:03.830
(tense music)

36:42.471 --> 36:43.304
Hello?

36:47.190 --> 36:48.023
Okay.

36:56.224 --> 36:57.141
Fuck, fuck.

37:00.459 --> 37:03.720
(phone rings)

37:03.720 --> 37:06.070
Ric, Ric?

37:06.070 --> 37:06.903
Where are you?

37:10.307 --> 37:11.557
I'm in trouble.

37:14.380 --> 37:15.213
Please.

37:16.441 --> 37:17.691
I'm in trouble.

37:19.521 --> 37:20.354
Ric.

37:24.200 --> 37:25.033
I'm in trouble.

37:26.460 --> 37:27.907
I'm with some bad people.

37:29.299 --> 37:31.001
(dial tone blares)

37:31.001 --> 37:33.738
(shouts)

37:33.738 --> 37:35.738
(cries)

37:37.356 --> 37:38.847
Okay.

37:38.847 --> 37:40.538
Come on, girl.

37:40.538 --> 37:43.199
Okay, no one can help you but you,

37:43.199 --> 37:44.693
no one can help you but you.

37:46.069 --> 37:46.902
Okay.

37:54.634 --> 37:58.603
- Nova, I've been thinking
about you a lot lately,

37:59.740 --> 38:02.883
living in that dark little cave of yours.

38:04.380 --> 38:07.870
Having had everything taken from you,

38:07.870 --> 38:10.940
passed off and given to
people who didn't deserve it,

38:10.940 --> 38:13.950
who didn't earn it, who
haven't worked hard.

38:13.950 --> 38:18.950
I've begun to think that
maybe God has a plan for you.

38:19.090 --> 38:20.713
A good white woman with nothing.

38:22.400 --> 38:24.540
It's my belief that God
wants us to fight back,

38:24.540 --> 38:27.030
to fight for change.

38:27.030 --> 38:28.563
To take it back.

38:30.740 --> 38:32.730
- [Newscaster] All federal
buildings are on high alert,

38:32.730 --> 38:35.160
but law enforcement resources
are spread very thin.

38:35.160 --> 38:38.310
It's safe to say right now
that each man is for himself.

38:38.310 --> 38:40.220
This is the known symbol of their militia.

38:40.220 --> 38:42.887
If you see something, say something.

38:46.514 --> 38:49.431
(foreboding music)

39:22.706 --> 39:25.456
(dramatic music)

39:29.076 --> 39:31.225
(metal clangs)

39:31.225 --> 39:33.808
(chains clink)

39:35.278 --> 39:37.611
(man moans)

39:41.838 --> 39:43.005
- Who are you?

39:49.791 --> 39:50.874
Are you hurt?

39:53.243 --> 39:54.764
Okay.

39:54.764 --> 39:55.597
All right.

39:57.292 --> 39:58.783
Okay.

39:58.783 --> 40:00.866
(grunts)

40:03.900 --> 40:06.067
Okay, oh my god, okay.

40:07.111 --> 40:10.130
Okay, okay, okay, one second.

40:10.130 --> 40:12.547
(man coughs)

40:15.834 --> 40:18.251
(Fay grunts)

40:19.507 --> 40:21.809
Okay, okay, okay.

40:21.809 --> 40:22.642
Oh my god.

40:24.161 --> 40:26.468
You're okay, you're okay, you're okay.

40:26.468 --> 40:28.081
You're all right now, you're all right.

40:28.081 --> 40:29.137
You're all right, you're all right.

40:29.137 --> 40:30.720
Okay, okay, oh man.

40:33.027 --> 40:34.240
- Where are they?

40:34.240 --> 40:36.623
- There's no one here right
now, they're all gone.

40:37.540 --> 40:40.270
- We can't stay here, we gotta go. (sobs)

40:40.270 --> 40:41.650
- Okay, okay.

40:41.650 --> 40:43.512
Can you stand?

40:43.512 --> 40:44.925
I'll help you, help you.

40:44.925 --> 40:47.845
Okay, on three, one, two.

40:47.845 --> 40:49.920
(grunts) Three.

40:49.920 --> 40:51.587
Okay, come on, okay.

40:54.657 --> 40:57.091
(grunts)

40:57.091 --> 40:58.674
Okay, okay.

41:05.958 --> 41:07.870
- I can't walk!

41:07.870 --> 41:09.190
- What happened?

41:09.190 --> 41:12.343
- They jumped me, beat me up.

41:14.080 --> 41:15.700
I thought they was gonna kill me.

41:15.700 --> 41:16.880
- Who?

41:16.880 --> 41:18.679
Who did this?

41:18.679 --> 41:19.512
- I don't know who they are.

41:20.940 --> 41:22.943
Skinheads, white boys.

41:25.559 --> 41:27.697
Some guy they call Lestor.

41:27.697 --> 41:30.405
- Lestor, what, fuck.

41:30.405 --> 41:31.822
Okay, okay.

41:33.524 --> 41:34.734
Stay with me, stay with me.

41:34.734 --> 41:37.603
Hey, hey, hey, come on, stay with me.

41:37.603 --> 41:38.934
Hey, hey.

41:38.934 --> 41:41.690
- I don't wanna be here
when they get back.

41:41.690 --> 41:44.920
- We can't go outside, it's not safe.

41:44.920 --> 41:46.200
- We're not safe here.

41:49.105 --> 41:50.530
Can we lock the door

41:50.530 --> 41:52.130
or something?
- No, no.

41:52.130 --> 41:53.130
No, they have a key.

41:54.600 --> 41:56.324
That won't keep them out.

41:56.324 --> 41:58.241
What is it, what is it?

41:59.410 --> 42:01.530
What's in the van, what's in the van?

42:01.530 --> 42:03.877
- Chemicals, dangerous stuff.

42:03.877 --> 42:04.710
- My god.

42:04.710 --> 42:07.973
- I was on my way to the plant
and dump when they jumped me.

42:09.040 --> 42:12.330
- [Fay] Did they say what they
were gonna do with the stuff?

42:12.330 --> 42:13.985
- No. (sobs)

42:13.985 --> 42:16.710
But I'm pretty sure it's some crazy

42:16.710 --> 42:18.797
let's kill a lot of black folk shit.

42:19.647 --> 42:21.000
- Okay, okay, listen to me.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.923
We have to stop them, okay?

42:25.470 --> 42:26.883
- How you think we gonna do that?

42:27.920 --> 42:29.083
I can't even walk.

42:32.120 --> 42:33.613
- I'm a cop.

42:33.613 --> 42:36.314
(Issac sobs)

42:36.314 --> 42:37.314
- You a cop.

42:38.240 --> 42:40.040
You don't even look like a cop.

42:40.040 --> 42:42.560
- Well I just graduated from the academy,

42:42.560 --> 42:44.070
and they still haven't
given me my assignment,

42:44.070 --> 42:46.000
but yes, I'm a cop.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.010
- Good for you.

42:49.090 --> 42:50.754
Now what?

42:50.754 --> 42:52.940
- Okay, okay, okay.

42:52.940 --> 42:53.773
I have a gun.

42:54.630 --> 42:56.567
It's in my car, come on.

42:56.567 --> 42:58.113
I have to go and get it.

42:59.364 --> 43:00.197
Hey.

43:01.210 --> 43:03.400
Can you let me in if I come back?

43:03.400 --> 43:05.810
Can you do that, I need yes, yes or no.

43:05.810 --> 43:06.710
Yes, yes?

43:06.710 --> 43:09.183
Okay, okay, good, good, good.

43:17.370 --> 43:19.790
Lock the door, listen for me.

43:19.790 --> 43:23.323
I'll be right back, I promise.

43:23.323 --> 43:24.156
Okay.

43:26.094 --> 43:28.177
(grunts)

43:30.045 --> 43:32.962
(foreboding music)

43:41.995 --> 43:44.328
(dog barks)

44:18.840 --> 44:21.340
(tense music)

44:36.779 --> 44:38.779
(gasps)

44:44.099 --> 44:46.432
(gun fires)

45:04.028 --> 45:06.361
(gun fires)

45:11.105 --> 45:14.105
(suspenseful music)

46:19.534 --> 46:22.034
(men arguing)

46:48.019 --> 46:50.686
(ominous music)

47:10.256 --> 47:12.006
- [Lestor] All right.

47:19.980 --> 47:22.473
- Now it's as if we--
- Guys, bro?

47:22.473 --> 47:24.050
- I told you we should've
killed that black girl

47:24.050 --> 47:24.933
before we left.

47:26.863 --> 47:28.410
God, why did we bring this kid with us?

47:28.410 --> 47:29.419
This ain't no time to get your nuts--

47:29.419 --> 47:30.903
- The fuck is your problem?
- Stop, enough, all right,

47:30.903 --> 47:32.610
both of you knock it off!

47:32.610 --> 47:34.310
We've got bigger fish to fry.

47:34.310 --> 47:35.550
I want you to get the driver

47:35.550 --> 47:37.460
into the truck with the explosives,

47:37.460 --> 47:39.410
and I want this rig ready
to go within the hour,

47:39.410 --> 47:41.040
am I understood?

47:41.040 --> 47:42.640
Now where the fuck fuck is my--

47:42.640 --> 47:44.360
- Don't move!

47:44.360 --> 47:46.030
Drop your weapons on the floor.

47:46.030 --> 47:48.053
Do it now, or I'll shoot.

47:57.730 --> 47:59.730
Now kick your weapons towards the walls.

48:01.660 --> 48:02.995
- Now what?

48:02.995 --> 48:04.130
You gonna shoot all of us?

48:04.130 --> 48:06.530
- I'm gonna shoot you if
you don't shut the fuck up.

48:06.530 --> 48:08.680
- Do it, you can't stop what's coming.

48:08.680 --> 48:10.076
- Don't make me.
- Hm?

48:10.076 --> 48:15.076
(gun fires)
(Max grunts in pain)

48:20.185 --> 48:21.665
- Fuck.

48:21.665 --> 48:23.020
- [Max] That bitch
almost shot my foot off!

48:23.020 --> 48:26.214
- Yo man, she locked herself
in the van, you idiot!

48:26.214 --> 48:27.650
- Fuck the van, what about my foot?

48:27.650 --> 48:29.237
- All right, both of you shut up a second.

48:29.237 --> 48:31.486
Now she's got the detonator,

48:31.486 --> 48:32.713
and we can't arm the
explosives without it.

48:32.713 --> 48:34.040
- Just shoot the lock off.

48:34.040 --> 48:35.633
- Are you fucking stupid?

48:36.562 --> 48:38.700
Do you remember what we
just loaded in there?

48:38.700 --> 48:40.880
You blow the lock off, you
blow the whole building apart

48:40.880 --> 48:41.780
and us with it.

48:41.780 --> 48:43.160
- Told you this kid was a moron.

48:43.160 --> 48:44.700
- Okay, we can't blow the lock off,

48:44.700 --> 48:46.100
she ain't coming out on her own,

48:46.100 --> 48:47.960
so how do we get that
black bitch out of there?

48:47.960 --> 48:50.703
- Just get my tools.

49:04.340 --> 49:07.203
Hey, uh, lady?

49:08.580 --> 49:10.180
Can we talk about this a second?

49:11.390 --> 49:13.163
- Ain't nothing to talk about.

49:13.163 --> 49:15.260
I ain't opening that door.

49:15.260 --> 49:16.277
- [Lestor] I think you got me

49:16.277 --> 49:18.783
and my boys out here all wrong.

49:19.720 --> 49:23.836
- Oh yeah, you're just a
bunch of boy scouts, right?

49:23.836 --> 49:25.600
- (chuckles) Well, I mean, you know,

49:25.600 --> 49:28.500
there's some materials in
there that are very dangerous,

49:28.500 --> 49:31.990
and if you're not careful,
you're gonna get yourself hurt.

49:31.990 --> 49:34.313
- We all might get hurt
if you don't back off.

49:37.240 --> 49:38.823
- Okay, listen.

49:39.670 --> 49:43.570
I'm gonna go ahead and introduce
myself proper-like now.

49:43.570 --> 49:48.320
I am the big bad wolf,
and one way or another,

49:48.320 --> 49:51.130
I am coming in there.

49:51.130 --> 49:53.770
Now are you really gonna
make me huff and puff

49:53.770 --> 49:56.617
before I blow your fucking house in!

49:56.617 --> 49:59.117
(tense music)

50:15.516 --> 50:18.016
(drill whirs)

50:20.040 --> 50:21.190
Time's almost up, Miss!

50:26.906 --> 50:30.823
We gonna do this the easy
way or the messy way?

50:32.260 --> 50:33.733
Okay, messy way it is.

50:35.405 --> 50:37.935
(gun fires)
Oh shit!

50:37.935 --> 50:39.210
- It's gonna get a lot messier than that

50:39.210 --> 50:40.493
if you come any closer.

50:41.720 --> 50:43.815
- Are you trying to get yourself blown up,

50:43.815 --> 50:44.750
you stupid bitch?

50:44.750 --> 50:48.060
- If I go, we all go, you
dumb white motherfucker.

50:48.060 --> 50:49.570
- [Nova] Leave her alone.

50:49.570 --> 50:51.033
She's a nice person.

50:53.390 --> 50:54.223
- Nova?

50:56.186 --> 50:58.270
(somber music)

50:58.270 --> 50:59.103
Is that you?

51:00.805 --> 51:03.674
- Why did you come back?

51:03.674 --> 51:05.257
You didn't have to.

51:07.074 --> 51:08.907
Why did you come back?

51:11.513 --> 51:13.200
- I can't explain it.

51:13.200 --> 51:14.313
- You saved me.

51:16.764 --> 51:18.133
I didn't wanna drug you.

51:20.150 --> 51:23.743
But I had to, or they
would've killed you on sight.

51:24.830 --> 51:25.863
- Then help me.

51:26.770 --> 51:27.603
Do something.

51:29.290 --> 51:30.123
- No.

51:31.390 --> 51:32.713
She ain't gonna do shit.

51:37.780 --> 51:38.973
She belongs to me.

51:46.350 --> 51:47.483
- Nova.

51:50.330 --> 51:54.893
Just tell them to back away
from the van, and I'll come out.

51:57.340 --> 51:58.173
- Why?

51:59.210 --> 52:00.560
What are you gonna do then?

52:04.670 --> 52:06.170
- I'll give you what you want.

52:07.900 --> 52:10.410
Just give me the van driver and I'll leave

52:10.410 --> 52:12.053
if you just let me have him.

52:16.380 --> 52:17.973
- You want a half dead driver?

52:19.220 --> 52:21.743
You can have him, my gift to you.

52:23.010 --> 52:25.793
I mean, he's probably not gonna
make it till morning anyway.

52:26.660 --> 52:27.610
- We've got a deal.

52:28.700 --> 52:33.173
Back away from the van, and I'll come out.

52:36.684 --> 52:39.033
- Back up.

52:39.033 --> 52:42.783
She said that she'll
come out if you back up.

53:11.471 --> 53:13.971
(tense music)

53:16.246 --> 53:17.079
- Nova.

53:28.943 --> 53:31.833
You're not, you're not gonna shoot me.

53:33.673 --> 53:35.423
You're a good person.

53:36.630 --> 53:39.250
You may have gotten into
it with the wrong people,

53:40.572 --> 53:42.655
but you're not like them.

53:44.013 --> 53:44.846
No.

53:46.836 --> 53:47.836
Put it down.

53:49.625 --> 53:51.093
Yeah.

53:51.093 --> 53:51.926
Okay.

53:53.493 --> 53:54.326
- Nova.

53:57.163 --> 53:59.397
What are you doing?

53:59.397 --> 54:01.853
You know you can't trust them.

54:03.240 --> 54:05.270
- Nova, don't listen to him.

54:05.270 --> 54:07.553
- You remember what you told me?

54:07.553 --> 54:10.847
What they did to you when
you were a little girl?

54:12.767 --> 54:13.743
How they hurt you?

54:15.490 --> 54:18.652
Never gonna let that
happen again, are you?

54:18.652 --> 54:19.652
Never again.

54:34.732 --> 54:38.065
(emergency sirens wail)

54:39.542 --> 54:40.375
(Fay grunts)

54:40.375 --> 54:41.964
- Okay, synced up.

54:41.964 --> 54:43.164
- Put that in the truck.

54:44.190 --> 54:46.160
Wrap this shit show up, people.

54:46.160 --> 54:47.450
Wheels up in five minutes.

54:47.450 --> 54:49.780
Dallas, gas up the truck,
I want it topped off.

54:49.780 --> 54:50.680
- [Dallas] Got it.

54:51.840 --> 54:53.602
- Yeah, we're good.

54:53.602 --> 54:56.869
(timer beeps)

54:56.869 --> 54:57.702
It's okay.

55:10.640 --> 55:12.113
- Why are you doing this?

55:16.230 --> 55:17.630
- I could tell you the story

55:18.920 --> 55:22.790
about how when I was a little
kid, I got jumped every day

55:22.790 --> 55:25.193
by a bunch of big black
kids in my neighborhood.

55:27.170 --> 55:29.650
Or I could tell you the story

55:29.650 --> 55:33.550
about how my dad lost his job

55:33.550 --> 55:36.150
because the company had to
fill some bullshit quota.

55:37.850 --> 55:41.148
No, I know the one you wanna hear.

55:41.148 --> 55:44.620
You wanna hear the one
about how some drunk nigger

55:44.620 --> 55:49.620
fucking ran his car into my
wife's at 80 miles an hour,

55:50.840 --> 55:52.690
and what I had to say at her funeral.

55:54.830 --> 55:55.663
- Is that true?

55:57.430 --> 55:58.603
- Does it matter?

56:00.063 --> 56:02.023
It could all be true, or none of it.

56:03.444 --> 56:04.570
It still wouldn't change the fact

56:04.570 --> 56:07.633
that you will never understand
this white man's burden.

56:14.920 --> 56:16.960
Hour from now, things go boom.

56:16.960 --> 56:18.453
- [Max] What do we do with her?

56:19.470 --> 56:20.540
- Fuck it, throw her in the truck,

56:20.540 --> 56:22.640
it's more body parts for the cleanup crew.

56:28.210 --> 56:30.840
- In another life, you and
I would've had some fun

56:30.840 --> 56:32.627
before I did this.

56:32.627 --> 56:33.565
(Fay grunts)

56:33.565 --> 56:34.576
(door opens)

56:34.576 --> 56:36.210
- Whoa, whoa.

56:36.210 --> 56:37.043
Hey, friend.

56:38.900 --> 56:40.860
Oh, sorry, I thought you were another one

56:40.860 --> 56:42.510
of them crazy monkeys with a gun.

56:43.392 --> 56:45.720
- Nah, I heard the noise, man.

56:45.720 --> 56:47.293
Needed to get out of the street.

56:47.293 --> 56:48.583
It's crazy out there.

56:50.250 --> 56:51.885
- Yeah.

56:51.885 --> 56:53.285
About to get crazy here too.

56:55.690 --> 56:58.650
Say I find myself in need of
another able-bodied individual.

56:58.650 --> 57:00.850
I don't suppose you'd
be willing to join us?

57:05.560 --> 57:07.560
- Looks like you're up to something big.

57:09.750 --> 57:10.743
I like big stuff.

57:13.160 --> 57:15.380
- Big stuff, I like that.

57:15.380 --> 57:16.930
Well big stuff, we're
about to go get ourselves

57:16.930 --> 57:17.980
a whole lot of money.

57:19.160 --> 57:20.680
- What are you talking about?

57:20.680 --> 57:24.750
- While the world is burning,
we're gonna go rob a bank.

57:24.750 --> 57:26.690
The World Bank, in fact.

57:26.690 --> 57:27.830
And they got enough money in there

57:27.830 --> 57:30.460
that you can live whatever
kind of life you want.

57:30.460 --> 57:32.870
- So you're robbing a bank
in the middle of a riot.

57:32.870 --> 57:34.010
- Well, best time to steal shit's

57:34.010 --> 57:36.140
when no one's looking, right? (chuckles)

57:36.140 --> 57:38.030
We're just gonna drive down
there, blow a hole in the wall

57:38.030 --> 57:39.230
and walk out with everything they got.

57:39.230 --> 57:40.700
- [Max] Hey, why are you telling him?

57:40.700 --> 57:42.800
- Because your stupid
ass went and got shot

57:42.800 --> 57:45.183
and we need somebody else
who can drive the van.

57:47.180 --> 57:48.680
So what do you say, big stuff?

57:49.870 --> 57:50.703
Are you in?

57:52.160 --> 57:52.993
Or are you out?

57:57.140 --> 57:58.624
- I'm in.

57:58.624 --> 58:00.960
(laughs)

58:00.960 --> 58:03.763
- All right, let's get
this show on the road.

58:08.220 --> 58:09.800
- This bitch is a cop.

58:09.800 --> 58:10.633
- What?

58:12.950 --> 58:14.970
- Fucking bitch.

58:14.970 --> 58:16.550
He's with her.

58:16.550 --> 58:17.383
- God damn it.

58:20.430 --> 58:23.017
All right, I'll tell you what, big stuff.

58:23.017 --> 58:26.040
(tense music)

58:26.040 --> 58:28.687
I'm gonna blow your
girlfriend's pretty face off.

58:28.687 --> 58:30.200
- Do it and you're dead.

58:30.200 --> 58:31.790
- [Lestor] Drop your fucking gun.

58:31.790 --> 58:34.770
- You first!
- I will shoot her!

58:34.770 --> 58:37.180
You wanna see her brains
all over the fucking floor?

58:37.180 --> 58:38.317
- I can't let you leave here.

58:38.317 --> 58:41.183
- Put the fucking gun down,
you fucking nigger lover.

58:43.890 --> 58:45.513
Put the gun down now!

58:45.513 --> 58:47.759
(guns fire)

58:47.759 --> 58:50.426
(Lestor grunts)

58:52.608 --> 58:54.613
Ah, fuck.

58:58.911 --> 59:01.661
(dramatic music)

59:33.350 --> 59:35.153
- So much for the white wave, huh?

59:36.810 --> 59:38.880
- I should've never let you in here.

59:38.880 --> 59:41.520
- You shouldn't have got
mixed in with those guys.

59:41.520 --> 59:43.770
- I still gotta sacrifice
for what I believe.

59:46.290 --> 59:49.843
You see, it's not too
late for the revolution.

59:50.810 --> 59:52.520
(dramatic music)

59:52.520 --> 59:53.770
- What are you afraid of?

59:55.597 --> 59:57.883
- If we let the monkeys out of the cage,

59:59.520 --> 1:00:01.410
they'll remember how we treated them.

1:00:13.722 --> 1:00:17.043
(gun fires)
(Fay grunts)

1:00:17.043 --> 1:00:19.876
Okay, okay, okay.

1:00:54.122 --> 1:00:56.705
(fan clatters)

1:01:32.918 --> 1:01:35.001
(groans)

1:02:01.899 --> 1:02:03.400
(timer beeps)

1:02:03.400 --> 1:02:05.900
(tense music)

1:02:08.578 --> 1:02:10.995
(Fay grunts)

1:02:39.690 --> 1:02:42.273
(fan clatters)

1:03:23.107 --> 1:03:24.809
- Hey, beautiful.

1:03:24.809 --> 1:03:27.209
- What took you so long?

1:03:27.209 --> 1:03:28.649
- Little bit of traffic, babe.

1:03:28.649 --> 1:03:31.066
(Fay laughs)

1:03:35.695 --> 1:03:37.447
Ah, fuck.
- Can you stand?

1:03:37.447 --> 1:03:38.530
- I think so.

1:03:41.645 --> 1:03:42.562
Help me up.

1:03:46.204 --> 1:03:50.304
God. (groans)

1:03:58.672 --> 1:04:01.589
(foreboding music)

1:04:05.833 --> 1:04:07.833
(gasps)

1:04:39.753 --> 1:04:42.170
(Fay grunts)

1:04:48.681 --> 1:04:50.224
God.

1:04:50.224 --> 1:04:52.641
(Ric groans)

1:04:53.513 --> 1:04:54.904
I can't go any further.

1:04:54.904 --> 1:04:55.987
- Okay, okay.

1:04:57.707 --> 1:04:59.457
I'm staying with you.

1:05:30.788 --> 1:05:33.538
(dramatic music)

1:06:04.061 --> 1:06:08.320
I'm scared.

1:06:08.320 --> 1:06:09.153
- I know.

1:06:11.004 --> 1:06:11.837
Me too.

1:06:18.391 --> 1:06:21.558
(thugs shout angrily)

1:06:25.963 --> 1:06:30.713
(guns fire)
(Fay shouts)

1:08:20.009 --> 1:08:22.759
(dramatic music)

1:10:22.898 --> 1:10:25.731
(projector whirs)
