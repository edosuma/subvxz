00:32.872 --> 00:34.779
Why she staring at him like that?

00:35.041 --> 00:37.247
You really want me to tell you why?

00:37.464 --> 00:39.367
I could.
You're not gonna want to hear it.

00:39.629 --> 00:41.786
All I'm saying is she's my girlfriend,
all right?

00:42.184 --> 00:45.665
She probably shouldn't be staring off
at Swedish people like that.

00:45.927 --> 00:47.917
Why don't you go over
and punch him in the face?

00:48.179 --> 00:49.627
Is that what you would do?

00:49.889 --> 00:51.865
In some situations,
you need to ask yourself

00:52.326 --> 00:54.966
WWRD?
What would Riggins do in this situation?

00:55.228 --> 00:56.627
He would walk over to him--

00:56.777 --> 00:59.979
Riggins would not be in this situation,
cause Riggins

01:00.138 --> 01:02.265
is captain of the SS Tatas over there.

01:02.712 --> 01:04.516
He's probably slept
with literally, like,

01:04.779 --> 01:06.204
half of the girls

01:06.345 --> 01:10.731
at Dillon High, not to mention
some of their moms and sisters--

01:12.954 --> 01:15.089
Look. That's the guy that's
gonna give me the ball.

01:15.277 --> 01:17.029
Smile, man, it's gonna be a good year.

01:17.291 --> 01:19.699
- Come on, smile.
- What's up, Smash?

01:19.961 --> 01:21.805
All you got to do is hang
on at my coattails.

01:24.455 --> 01:25.955
When did he turn into such a tool?

01:26.217 --> 01:27.629
This is ridiculous.

01:33.396 --> 01:34.589
It's never gonna happen.

01:34.776 --> 01:36.907
Don't be negative.
You don't know what could happen.

01:37.103 --> 01:38.514
What if I made team, and--

01:38.711 --> 01:40.303
she starts to see me...

01:41.064 --> 01:43.116
- I need to ask you.
- Spark something inside her.

01:43.325 --> 01:46.601
Why are you trying out for the team?
Because you're gonna get hurt.

01:46.863 --> 01:49.398
- Don't be cynical.
- Cynical?

02:03.671 --> 02:06.204
Hi, honey.
You watch my stuff for me, please?

02:06.734 --> 02:09.164
No, no mom.
You need to leave right now.

02:09.354 --> 02:12.003
How many times have we talked
about this? Don't come to the pool.

02:12.138 --> 02:13.489
We've already been through this.

02:13.701 --> 02:16.839
- This is the only place-- Excuse me.
- You can't show up all the time, mom.

02:17.045 --> 02:20.426
- Sweetie, I don't show up all the time.
- Can't you go to a different pool ?

02:20.688 --> 02:22.854
I miss your father,
you never talk to me anymore,

02:22.962 --> 02:25.290
there ain't a room in the house
big enough to contain me.

02:25.356 --> 02:26.370
I'm getting in the water.

02:26.445 --> 02:27.892
You're just here checking up on me--

02:28.154 --> 02:30.121
I am not checking up on you.
That is ridiculous.

02:31.651 --> 02:33.562
- You're just trying to spying on me.
- Honey,

02:33.665 --> 02:35.524
I'm not spying on you at all.

02:35.786 --> 02:38.895
I am curious about your life.
I enjoy being in the pool--

02:39.047 --> 02:40.853
Am I gonna have to help you
out of the pool?

02:40.947 --> 02:43.019
I am curious.
I am curious about "the Swede,"

02:43.141 --> 02:45.432
I'm curious about what Matt
thinks about the Swede,

02:45.620 --> 02:46.911
I'm curious about--
You don't--

02:47.173 --> 02:48.371
You're embarrassing me.

02:54.380 --> 02:55.488
Honey?

02:56.587 --> 02:58.172
I think my water just broke.

02:59.030 --> 03:01.717
Your water can't break, mom.
You have another three weeks.

03:01.979 --> 03:04.190
Either I just peed in the pool
or my water's broke.

03:11.656 --> 03:13.521
I can't do it.

03:13.783 --> 03:15.690
No, I can't do it anymore.
I'm too tired.

03:15.952 --> 03:17.233
Just hang in there, okay?

03:17.588 --> 03:19.777
Where the hell's your father?

03:36.182 --> 03:38.045
- Tami Taylor's room?
- Yeah, in 206.

03:47.945 --> 03:49.390
Hey, baby, hey baby.

03:55.702 --> 03:56.981
Can I stand here?

03:59.669 --> 04:01.472
Oh, honey.

04:01.641 --> 04:04.697
- Oh, I'm so happy to see you.
- How are you, huh?

04:08.934 --> 04:10.870
We need just a little bit more, darling.

04:14.010 --> 04:16.250
I'm gonna get you this baby,
but I can't do it alone.

04:17.031 --> 04:18.586
I hate you. It's coming.

04:43.236 --> 04:45.123
Welcome to the family.

06:22.660 --> 06:25.242
Come on, let's go little dancer.

06:25.357 --> 06:27.770
Welcome home, baby Grace.

06:28.521 --> 06:31.037
Here's your new home.

06:31.338 --> 06:33.545
This is where it's all gonna happen.

06:33.931 --> 06:35.514
It's all gonna happen right here.

06:35.776 --> 06:37.612
Jules!

06:40.729 --> 06:43.022
I had asked jules to clean this up.
Jules!

06:43.284 --> 06:46.650
Look who's home. Say hey.

06:46.912 --> 06:49.295
She's opening up her eyes.
So she can say, "Hey, big sis."

06:49.408 --> 06:51.733
- Why is her head so pointy?
- That's normal, sweetheart.

06:51.991 --> 06:53.597
How come you didn't clean this place up?

06:53.654 --> 06:55.945
Because I didn't have time.
I got to go to work. Sorry.

06:56.067 --> 06:59.078
I thought you were taking today off.
It's your sister's first day at home.

06:59.216 --> 07:01.999
I have to go to work, okay?
I love you guys. I'll be home tonight.

07:02.645 --> 07:04.448
Say hi to the Swede.

07:05.875 --> 07:06.879
Who's the Swede?

07:07.138 --> 07:09.924
Someone she's flirting with at the pool.
I can't believe this mess.

07:11.216 --> 07:12.426
What about the Saracen?

07:12.690 --> 07:15.679
She's dating the Saracen,
and she's flirting with the Swede.

07:18.831 --> 07:20.540
Welcome home, sweetheart.

07:22.031 --> 07:24.500
I think this whole football thing
is a terrible idea.

07:24.631 --> 07:26.106
You've mentioned that a few times.

07:26.528 --> 07:28.650
But does my shoulder
look swollen to you?

07:29.371 --> 07:31.269
You think your daddy's
gonna love you anymore?

07:31.457 --> 07:32.798
I do actually.

07:35.005 --> 07:37.240
- I am burning up.
- Me too.

07:38.323 --> 07:39.822
Would you mind doing my back for me?

07:42.609 --> 07:44.166
- Do what?
- My back.

07:44.428 --> 07:46.205
Yeah. Of course.

07:46.843 --> 07:47.942
Thanks.

07:49.587 --> 07:51.644
It's just...
You got to be sure

07:51.822 --> 07:53.738
to put on several coats
throughout the day.

07:53.869 --> 07:56.053
Got a little bit too much.
Are you ready?

08:06.325 --> 08:07.565
Actually, got a--

08:07.827 --> 08:09.846
I got a show on Thursday.
At the Bend.

08:10.496 --> 08:11.735
Oh, the Bend.

08:12.946 --> 08:15.781
- That's a cool place.
- You've been to the Bend?

08:18.026 --> 08:20.139
- Yeah, a few times.
- Well, you should come by.

08:20.901 --> 08:23.267
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah, what do you mean?

08:23.709 --> 08:26.417
- Okay.
- Yeah, it starts at eleven.

08:26.807 --> 08:28.103
Yeah, I guess,

08:28.196 --> 08:30.046
- I guess I'll see yo there, then.
- I guess.

08:30.666 --> 08:32.534
- All right.
- Yeah, don't be late.

08:40.217 --> 08:42.837
As you were born the first time
from broken waters,

08:42.948 --> 08:44.640
you will be born again today,

08:44.771 --> 08:46.478
from the broken waters of baptism

08:46.611 --> 08:49.857
and baptism is going to--
Upon the profession of your faith

08:50.119 --> 08:51.775
to the word of God, I baptise you

08:52.037 --> 08:53.838
in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.

09:04.856 --> 09:06.067
Ladies!

09:06.743 --> 09:09.250
You guys want to make
some memories tonight?

09:10.058 --> 09:11.842
I'm thinking like 7:30.

09:16.210 --> 09:17.703
Where's my flier, Garrity?

09:18.520 --> 09:20.970
No one would be happier
to save your soul than me, Tim.

09:23.994 --> 09:26.001
Christ Teen Messengers.

09:28.959 --> 09:30.689
What was that, like a cult or something?

09:32.191 --> 09:35.472
It's young Christians coming together
to worship and spread the word of Jesus.

09:35.778 --> 09:38.197
You look good. Like, real good.

09:38.459 --> 09:41.187
It's probably because
yesterday I was baptized

09:41.301 --> 09:43.118
and accepted Jesus
as my lord and savior.

09:44.840 --> 09:45.954
What did you do recently?

09:46.310 --> 09:48.123
I had a three-way with
the Stratton sisters.

09:48.489 --> 09:50.320
I wouldn't go around town bragging about

09:50.443 --> 09:52.670
how you spent your entire summer
in a drunken stupor.

09:52.932 --> 09:54.539
So what you're saying is you're jealous.

09:56.237 --> 09:58.640
Yeah, Tim. I'm jealous.

10:01.976 --> 10:03.222
Just so you know...

10:05.836 --> 10:07.366
You're still number one.

10:07.948 --> 10:09.554
You're still the best I've ever had.

10:14.512 --> 10:16.813
- It's true.
- Don't talk to me like that.

10:18.973 --> 10:20.512
Good-bye.

10:21.920 --> 10:24.220
- Enjoy Jesus.
- Enjoy your depraved hedonism.

10:24.530 --> 10:26.245
- Oh, I will.
- So will I.

10:27.549 --> 10:29.544
- I mean Jesus, not Hedonism.
- Of course.

10:30.783 --> 10:31.792
Jerk.

10:32.288 --> 10:33.931
Well, I don't care what the man said,

10:34.053 --> 10:35.950
I'm not gonna take off your uniform.

10:36.100 --> 10:38.340
It's really not that big of a deal,
grandma.

10:38.602 --> 10:42.081
So we don't need any...
any of that meat stuff.

10:44.566 --> 10:46.348
Oh, my Lord.

10:48.236 --> 10:50.853
How are you doing?
How are you?

10:51.115 --> 10:53.397
Coach Eric Taylor.

10:53.510 --> 10:54.732
How are you, son?

10:55.172 --> 10:56.552
Miss you.

10:59.491 --> 11:00.638
How you doin'?

11:01.750 --> 11:03.435
How come you didn't come to see Gracie?

11:03.585 --> 11:05.117
Because I had two two-a-days, so..

11:05.709 --> 11:08.909
- Julie's been telling about it.
- How are you and Julie doing?

11:09.459 --> 11:12.200
Good. Why?
I mean, did she say

11:12.416 --> 11:13.917
anything to you?

11:14.179 --> 11:16.866
She supposed to say something?
Something I'm supposed to know?

11:16.988 --> 11:18.876
- No, I just didn't know--
- Come see the kid.

11:18.989 --> 11:20.090
I was gonna come and see,

11:20.699 --> 11:23.403
you know, a lot of football,
and she's been lifeguarding, so...

11:24.708 --> 11:26.314
I didn't wanna just stop by.

11:27.056 --> 11:28.286
- All right.
- All right.

11:34.758 --> 11:37.608
Don't just stand by and watch it happen.

11:40.392 --> 11:41.537
You know what I'm saying?

11:42.358 --> 11:43.363
Yeah.

11:44.029 --> 11:46.133
I do. Thanks, coach.

11:47.025 --> 11:48.734
Take care.

11:52.238 --> 11:53.261
Hey, Carl.

11:59.475 --> 12:00.482
This-- this Friday?

12:02.144 --> 12:05.109
Well, I got football practice,
then I might go work out...

12:05.268 --> 12:07.127
After that. I'm serious.

12:07.268 --> 12:09.785
Well, call me if you want to see
a movie or something, okay?

12:36.136 --> 12:38.460
What happened?
Who was that?

12:40.946 --> 12:42.692
I- I think that was him.

12:43.584 --> 12:44.608
Was who?

12:46.184 --> 12:47.427
The guy who attacked me.

12:58.742 --> 13:00.900
- Come here.
- I'm going to bed.

13:01.435 --> 13:02.442
I've been at Lois.

13:03.201 --> 13:04.778
Come here, I want to talk to you.

13:07.547 --> 13:09.992
I just want to go to bed, okay?
I have work in the morning.

13:19.377 --> 13:20.377
How are you doing?

13:21.866 --> 13:22.880
Good.

13:25.729 --> 13:27.212
How are you and Matt doing?

13:28.649 --> 13:29.654
Fine.

13:30.179 --> 13:31.212
Good.

13:36.001 --> 13:37.436
Who is this Swedish guy?

13:43.157 --> 13:44.791
And what does this have to do with you?

13:48.565 --> 13:50.284
What does this have to do with me?

13:52.445 --> 13:54.703
I'm your father, that's what
it has to do with me.

13:57.572 --> 14:00.370
So you decide to come back
after eight months in Austin

14:00.587 --> 14:03.225
and have these deep long conversations?

14:05.649 --> 14:06.882
You are so hypocritical.

14:10.475 --> 14:12.324
I'm done. I'm tired.
I'm going to bed.

14:13.742 --> 14:14.897
Come here.

14:15.282 --> 14:17.017
Come here, come here!

14:20.782 --> 14:21.857
Six!

14:22.242 --> 14:23.247
Blue eight!

14:23.669 --> 14:24.674
Hut!

14:25.838 --> 14:26.860
Outside!

14:27.566 --> 14:29.284
Riggins, you gotta cut it.

14:29.887 --> 14:32.115
Come on, Riggins.
Come on.

14:37.089 --> 14:39.206
- What's Buddy doing here?
- Watching practice.

14:40.154 --> 14:41.416
I run closed practes.

14:41.872 --> 14:43.318
Send him home.

14:47.553 --> 14:49.487
- How are you?
- Hot enough for you?

14:49.620 --> 14:52.219
I've sweat runnin'
off my sweat, bro.

14:52.481 --> 14:55.472
This is awkward, but I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

14:59.947 --> 15:02.854
It's not pop warner. Keep your head up
like a man and stick him.

15:03.116 --> 15:06.264
If he wants me to leave, then he needs
to come over here and tell me himself.

15:06.590 --> 15:08.485
Cut him down. Do it again.

15:08.747 --> 15:09.861
Come on, Riggins.

15:10.318 --> 15:11.321
Black nine!

15:11.583 --> 15:13.238
Who does-- who does he think pays

15:13.351 --> 15:16.076
- his bloody damn salary.
- Would you tell him later?

15:17.618 --> 15:18.619
Come on, let's go.

15:23.284 --> 15:24.289
You know what?

15:24.763 --> 15:27.885
You are disgusting.
You are miserable, miserable!

15:29.634 --> 15:31.545
A miserable, god dang

15:31.812 --> 15:33.969
football player. You have no potential.

15:34.231 --> 15:35.846
You're just walking through this..

15:36.108 --> 15:38.390
What did you say to me?
Guys like you, okay?

15:38.814 --> 15:40.729
- With no heart--
- Oh, I got no heart?

15:41.114 --> 15:43.114
Here. This helmet...

15:43.612 --> 15:45.647
For your new full back,
good luck opening day.

15:46.110 --> 15:47.443
Riggins!

15:47.828 --> 15:49.776
You do not walk away from me, number 33!

16:39.129 --> 16:40.582
The point is...

16:41.119 --> 16:42.997
Is that she--

16:43.335 --> 16:44.956
she told me to lotion her up.

16:45.218 --> 16:47.029
Maybe she just didn't want
to get sunburn.

16:47.179 --> 16:49.419
All I'm saying is
I was literally inches away

16:50.192 --> 16:52.117
from, you know, copping a feel.

16:52.286 --> 16:53.985
It's a good picture of him, though.

16:54.728 --> 16:58.345
It's a great picture of the Smash.
He really looks like a captain.

17:02.738 --> 17:04.372
I'm gonna go get some cheetos.

17:06.365 --> 17:08.563
What's going on?
What you doin'?

17:09.036 --> 17:12.416
Nothin'.
Just-- just hanging.

17:21.265 --> 17:23.671
There's this party
at lake Orio Thursday.

17:23.844 --> 17:26.791
I was kind of hoping
maybe you'd come, please.

17:27.884 --> 17:32.212
I was just gonna stay at home,
and take it easy, read a book.

17:32.575 --> 17:35.364
The whole team is gonna be there.

17:35.571 --> 17:38.991
And everyone that's got a girlfriend,
their girlfriend's gonna be there.

17:39.141 --> 17:41.162
And since you're kind
of my girlfriend I was

17:41.791 --> 17:43.348
kind of hoping you'd be there.

17:47.002 --> 17:49.696
Look, it's just, you mean a lot to me,
and I don't want to just...

17:49.846 --> 17:51.142
Lose you.

17:55.658 --> 17:57.821
It sounds great.

17:58.346 --> 18:00.797
I'll try to make it.

18:01.379 --> 18:02.646
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

18:03.191 --> 18:04.731
- Thursday.
- Okay.

18:08.877 --> 18:10.829
- You're gonna love this.
- That's it.

18:11.022 --> 18:12.466
It's tofu-- come on, one more.

18:12.639 --> 18:15.172
Tofu and porcini mushroom,
it's got some onions in there,

18:15.434 --> 18:16.924
- some brown rice.
- I'm good.

18:17.065 --> 18:18.717
Got some beans there, we all set?

18:18.979 --> 18:20.844
- There you go.
- Looks delish!

18:22.315 --> 18:24.014
- Enjoy.
- Aren't we forgetting sothing?

18:25.152 --> 18:26.532
No, no.

18:27.897 --> 18:29.296
Of course.

18:32.599 --> 18:35.012
Thank you, Lord, for this food
that we are about to receive

18:35.162 --> 18:36.623
and for your wisdom, Lord.

18:36.939 --> 18:39.234
I pray that you will guide me
and everyone at this table

18:39.318 --> 18:41.637
to help respect you,
and make good choices.

18:42.663 --> 18:45.104
For exemple, to not take
advantage of the vulnerability

18:45.198 --> 18:47.611
of a recently separated,
but not yet divorced woman.

18:49.499 --> 18:52.899
And in turn, to give others
at the table the strength to remember

18:53.049 --> 18:55.866
that a mother of three should not
be wearing skinny jeans.

18:56.308 --> 18:57.312
Amen.

18:58.627 --> 18:59.633
Bon appetit.

19:00.608 --> 19:02.386
- Enjoy.
- Looks good.

19:08.761 --> 19:10.268
Please, sleep.

19:10.968 --> 19:12.273
Little girl.

19:12.699 --> 19:15.265
- Is she down good?
- Could you make some cookies?

19:16.092 --> 19:17.108
Thank you.

19:24.792 --> 19:25.984
You're nice to me.

19:31.956 --> 19:32.958
Carl called.

19:36.858 --> 19:38.623
They need me to come back Friday.

19:41.130 --> 19:42.133
Which Friday?

19:43.461 --> 19:44.784
This Friday?

19:45.526 --> 19:48.431
I thought you had two weeks.

19:54.015 --> 19:56.340
Bottom line, they need me back.
It's not my decision,

19:56.493 --> 19:58.912
*
he passed the buck up on his top.*

19:59.400 --> 20:00.630
And uh...

20:02.707 --> 20:05.636
We've been through this before,
we just have to deal with it.

20:05.786 --> 20:07.768
You know the drill, what happens.

20:24.345 --> 20:26.448
You know, I don't have a choice.

20:30.007 --> 20:32.139
The fact of the matter is,
I don't have a choice.

20:40.018 --> 20:41.220
I mean, it's--

20:43.201 --> 20:45.464
You know it's what I do.
I can't go, and I can't,

20:45.738 --> 20:47.365
I can't do this thing half-assed.

20:47.673 --> 20:49.503
I do it half-assed,
it doesn't help anyone.

20:50.020 --> 20:51.325
And I can't.

20:52.217 --> 20:53.513
No, I can't.

21:04.637 --> 21:05.998
You know?

21:11.330 --> 21:12.724
I really need you to talk.

21:22.668 --> 21:23.841
That's it?

21:46.324 --> 21:48.051
I'll be back in a little while, okay?

22:08.158 --> 22:13.145
<i>Dog thinks he is the boss.
He's not the boss. You are the boss.</i>

22:13.322 --> 22:15.495
<i>You must be dominate him.</i>

22:24.259 --> 22:25.818
*

22:26.381 --> 22:28.516
- Look what the cat *agged in.
- Unlock the door!

22:30.220 --> 22:31.516
You heard that...

22:32.361 --> 22:34.764
Tennessee Hillbilly stonewalled me.

22:35.356 --> 22:37.882
He won't even talk to me.
Locked me out of practice.

22:38.887 --> 22:41.022
Told mike mcGill that I was...

22:41.876 --> 22:43.606
an annoying nuisance.

22:45.632 --> 22:47.031
Can you imagine that?

22:53.759 --> 22:54.858
That is hard to...

22:56.670 --> 22:58.803
There is nothing I love more
than Dillon Panthers,

22:58.916 --> 23:01.072
I always have and you know
that I'm trying to help.

23:01.246 --> 23:03.751
That's all I'm trying to do.
That's all I've ever cared about.

23:04.062 --> 23:05.667
How long have you been sleeping here?

23:05.974 --> 23:07.046
I don't sleep here much.

23:07.491 --> 23:09.048
I work late sometimes.

23:09.310 --> 23:11.560
It's comfortable, you know,
the neon lights.

23:14.570 --> 23:17.264
- Congratulations on the baby.
- Thank you.

23:17.828 --> 23:19.428
Can I speak to you for a minute?

23:20.081 --> 23:21.433
- Out here.
- Yeah.

23:22.560 --> 23:23.969
I'll be righback.

23:26.119 --> 23:28.050
What were you doing
at soccer practice tonight?

23:28.200 --> 23:30.928
- What you're talking about.
- I saw you there, buddy.

23:31.078 --> 23:32.862
I do not understand

23:32.956 --> 23:35.450
how a smart, beautiful,
intelligent woman

23:35.712 --> 23:38.238
could fall

23:38.802 --> 23:40.580
for a little tree-hugger who makes

23:40.842 --> 23:42.764
seven dollars an hour
at health food store.

23:42.905 --> 23:45.418
He owns that store first of all,

23:45.680 --> 23:48.330
were you at my meditation group
the other night too?

23:48.531 --> 23:50.653
I have a right to protect my children,

23:50.747 --> 23:52.653
if I think their mother is becoming

23:52.738 --> 23:54.603
a part of some kind
of cult or something.

23:55.632 --> 23:56.635
You know what,

23:56.900 --> 23:58.431
- do whatever!
- Don't go to soccer

23:58.693 --> 24:00.609
- practice again.
- Do whatever you want.

24:00.759 --> 24:02.936
But he is not gonna turn
my children into communists,

24:03.247 --> 24:04.928
with all these hippie ideas.

24:05.603 --> 24:06.606
Is it-- He here?

24:06.925 --> 24:08.149
That's him? You here?

24:08.455 --> 24:11.178
You brought him here?
He's in my-- You get out of my truck!

24:12.540 --> 24:13.593
Open the damn door.

24:13.842 --> 24:15.573
Get out.
Unlock that door.

24:15.938 --> 24:18.284
- You come out of there.
- You gotta calm down!

24:19.366 --> 24:21.246
Unlock that door.

24:31.059 --> 24:33.072
Get in the car.
Don't make me--

24:33.323 --> 24:34.625
Stop, stop.

24:39.827 --> 24:40.848
It's all right.

24:44.808 --> 24:45.944
Come on, Riggins.

24:53.176 --> 24:55.984
- What you gonna have for dinner?
- I think I'm gonna have a salad.

24:56.134 --> 24:58.134
- I got some chicken.
- I got to get in shape.

24:58.960 --> 25:00.322
I'm gonna learn how to surf.

25:00.735 --> 25:03.674
- That'd be good.
- If not now, when?

25:04.483 --> 25:05.497
Come on.

25:07.291 --> 25:08.791
Pick it up, Riggins!
Come on!

25:18.281 --> 25:19.831
I think he's had enough, coach.

25:20.084 --> 25:21.097
He owes me five more.

25:23.361 --> 25:25.059
- Come on, Riggins.
- Five more, son.

25:34.275 --> 25:36.088
All right, Riggins, you're done.

25:38.144 --> 25:40.044
First off, I would like to say that...

25:40.764 --> 25:42.360
This is your team.

25:42.888 --> 25:44.925
And 100 percent I am in support

25:45.151 --> 25:47.540
of you, and the decisions you make,

25:47.802 --> 25:49.132
and the leadership of the team.

25:49.724 --> 25:50.728
Go on.

25:51.874 --> 25:53.461
I know Tim Riggins really well.

25:54.411 --> 25:58.007
Both on and off the field.
He's one of my closest friends.

25:59.350 --> 26:02.599
Leaning on him like that isn't
gonna get you any results, sir.

26:09.421 --> 26:10.486
Well...

26:12.430 --> 26:13.989
You got a decision to make, Jason.

26:15.179 --> 26:18.193
You can come to the games
Friday nights, and be some kind of...

26:19.451 --> 26:20.657
town symbol

26:20.919 --> 26:22.118
some kind of mascot.

26:22.859 --> 26:25.536
Or you can come to Friday night games,
and you can be

26:26.014 --> 26:27.544
a football coach.

26:28.737 --> 26:30.183
But you can't be both.

26:31.610 --> 26:33.037
They can't be your friends.

26:45.478 --> 26:47.100
- Hey, honey.
- Hey.

26:47.349 --> 26:49.197
I want you home
by eleven o'clock, all right?

26:49.347 --> 26:50.793
Mom said eleven thirty.

26:50.934 --> 26:53.545
I don't care what she said.
I want you home by eleven o'clock.

26:53.695 --> 26:55.498
Your absentee father says
eleven o'clock,

26:55.601 --> 26:58.806
but of course if you'd like to make it
ten thirty, we can make that happen too.

26:58.980 --> 27:00.118
- Whatever.
- And if Lois

27:00.291 --> 27:03.032
should even look at any alcohol
this evening, I want you

27:03.294 --> 27:04.994
to give me a call, you understand?

27:05.426 --> 27:06.909
Where are your shoes?

27:07.409 --> 27:09.522
I'm not wearing shoes, dad.

27:46.042 --> 27:47.516
Ty. Are you okay?

27:47.610 --> 27:50.272
- What took you so long?
- I came just as soon you call...

27:50.530 --> 27:52.633
- Where do you hear the noises from?
- Out here.

27:55.763 --> 27:58.421
- Be careful.
- You stay here, okay.

27:58.683 --> 27:59.919
I'm gonna check the perimeter.

28:00.163 --> 28:02.097
- Near the tree.
- Make sure everything's okay.

28:02.191 --> 28:03.759
I'm sure it's nothing.

28:04.906 --> 28:07.676
All right, your knight
in shining armor has arrived.

28:29.713 --> 28:30.719
Tyra, it's a skunk.

28:30.903 --> 28:33.289
Tyra, that's a skunk.

28:33.840 --> 28:35.962
- Let me in in the front.
- A skunk?

28:36.084 --> 28:39.793
I just don't want to get sprayed.
It's fine. There's none back here.

28:53.936 --> 28:56.164
I've to go home.
My mom gonna beat the hell out of me.

28:56.342 --> 28:57.892
We should've gone to the party.

28:58.164 --> 28:59.190
It's okay. You can go.

28:59.610 --> 29:01.734
- What?
- No, it's okay. I'll find a ride.

29:01.996 --> 29:03.732
I'm not just going to leave you here.

29:04.411 --> 29:06.167
I swear. It's fine, Lois.

29:11.585 --> 29:12.745
Call me later, okay?

30:06.730 --> 30:08.676
Man, I'm in Tyra Collette's
bathroom right now.

30:08.826 --> 30:10.512
<i>Why are you calling me from</i>

30:10.773 --> 30:13.126
- the bathroom?
- You gotta try to keep up me here,

30:13.276 --> 30:14.995
cause I've got like 45 seconds

30:15.089 --> 30:18.103
and I really need to get
your advice on something.

30:18.259 --> 30:20.602
I'm on Tyra's couch.
We're watching Fried Green Tomatoes.

30:20.686 --> 30:24.208
Everything's going great.
And I need to figure out

30:24.358 --> 30:25.526
how to get my arm around her.

30:25.955 --> 30:28.070
No, no. Look,
does she want you to touch her?

30:28.473 --> 30:31.694
I'm not calling you for relationship
advice, I'm calling you

30:31.947 --> 30:34.535
to find just some technique.

30:34.797 --> 30:37.331
<i>Just sit down close to her
and try, I don't know,</i>

30:37.629 --> 30:39.157
rub your arm against hers.

30:39.423 --> 30:41.262
If she doesn't hit you
or doesn't seem weird

30:41.493 --> 30:43.097
then try to put your arm around her.

30:43.247 --> 30:45.670
All right.
Me, once I get my arm around her,

30:45.793 --> 30:47.521
things will just kind
of fall into place,

30:47.653 --> 30:49.884
this has been like a long time coming.

30:50.146 --> 30:52.970
Anyways, I got to go.
How you doing at the party?

30:53.232 --> 30:56.515
- It kinda sucks. Julie never showed up.
- <i>That sounds great, man.</i>

30:57.243 --> 30:59.894
I'll call you later and let you
know how this goes.

31:37.783 --> 31:40.046
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Are you hungry?

31:41.361 --> 31:42.440
Are you hungry?

31:42.938 --> 31:46.148
- Yeah. I'm hungry.
- Let's go get some food.

31:53.379 --> 31:54.865
Well, yeah. Come again.

31:55.127 --> 31:56.140
It's good to see you.

32:02.367 --> 32:04.320
What's up? You came.

32:04.451 --> 32:05.634
Did you like it?

32:05.767 --> 32:07.795
It was totally amazing.

32:08.162 --> 32:09.908
I was pretty nervous.
I don't know.

32:10.303 --> 32:12.688
No, you guys looked awesome up there.

32:13.384 --> 32:16.511
Well, come-- Just come again.
Just don't say enything else.

32:16.933 --> 32:20.550
No, I mean, it was emotional
and heartbreaking.

32:20.778 --> 32:22.577
I'm adamant.
You gotta come again.

32:22.780 --> 32:25.287
Babe. I gotta go.

32:27.749 --> 32:30.105
Julie, this is Meg.
Meg, Julie.

32:30.650 --> 32:33.446
Julie. Your friend from the pool.

32:33.708 --> 32:36.532
Your high school bud. It nice
to meet you. Antoine loves you.

32:39.630 --> 32:42.897
We have this party. And if I don't
show up, my sister is going to kill me.

32:43.977 --> 32:46.542
- It was nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you too.

32:50.816 --> 32:52.384
I'm really happy you came.

33:17.334 --> 33:18.908
You gotta be kidding me.

33:19.730 --> 33:20.951
Can we just go?

33:21.430 --> 33:22.716
Can we go?

33:24.087 --> 33:26.457
Yeah.
No, no, we can't go.

33:26.719 --> 33:29.065
We can go as soon as you tell me
what the hell you' doing

33:29.150 --> 33:31.837
at a place like this at 12:30 at night,
and then we can go.

33:32.145 --> 33:33.892
I know I'm grounded and everything.

33:34.143 --> 33:36.130
Can you just really
not yell at me right now?

33:37.021 --> 33:38.542
Can I tell you something?

33:39.369 --> 33:40.674
I'm leaving early.

33:41.059 --> 33:43.182
I have to leave tomorrow night,
all right?

33:45.683 --> 33:47.492
I'm not gonna be back maybe
for a few weeks.

33:47.642 --> 33:49.896
So you being my daughter,
I'd sort of like

33:49.980 --> 33:51.839
to know what the hell is going on.

33:57.190 --> 33:59.706
I came here to chasing some boy.

34:00.716 --> 34:05.857
And got completely humiliated
because guess what, he has a girlfriend.

34:06.722 --> 34:08.748
I misread every stupid signal.

34:19.380 --> 34:22.330
What's going on with you and Matt,
what's wrong with that?

34:24.431 --> 34:27.417
There is nothing wrong,
that's the point, okay?

34:28.071 --> 34:31.688
Matt's perfect, right?
And we're the hit couple.

34:36.719 --> 34:39.818
But I just-- I see him turning into you

34:40.289 --> 34:42.195
and-- and me turning into my mom.

34:43.659 --> 34:46.101
And that just terrified
the crap out of me.

34:47.158 --> 34:48.952
And. I'm 16.
There is just--

34:50.556 --> 34:52.895
There has to be more than this.

34:59.881 --> 35:01.271
And I just...

35:04.210 --> 35:06.724
I feel so guilty for feeling like this.

35:14.902 --> 35:16.329
Listen to me.

35:22.517 --> 35:23.944
You can leave Matt.

35:25.401 --> 35:26.869
No one is gonna love you any less.

35:27.514 --> 35:28.857
You realize that, don't you?

35:33.758 --> 35:34.913
You got that?

35:40.044 --> 35:43.040
The other guy sounds to me, like,

35:43.537 --> 35:45.021
you know, he's...

35:46.309 --> 35:47.849
he's some other guy.

35:49.323 --> 35:50.891
He's just some other guy.

35:54.606 --> 35:55.827
Hell with him.

36:01.019 --> 36:02.029
You're all right.

36:02.871 --> 36:03.932
It's all good.

36:08.833 --> 36:10.287
We really miss having you around.

36:14.542 --> 36:17.387
OK, so we got Kit Kats, Nachos.

36:17.697 --> 36:19.190
- Okay.
- You get the Pringles.

36:19.781 --> 36:22.429
Kit Kats, Nachos, Pringles. Is that it?

36:23.256 --> 36:24.465
yes, and you are on your own,

36:24.730 --> 36:27.763
because I forgot that the
Collette account has a little overdue.

36:30.007 --> 36:32.907
- Pringles, Nachos--
- And don't forget the Ding Dongs.

36:33.269 --> 36:35.766
Are you gonna eat all them?
I'm not gonna help you out.

36:35.851 --> 36:37.815
'Cause I'm tryin' to cut down.

36:38.123 --> 36:39.233
You know I'll eat all at.

36:39.981 --> 36:40.985
Okay, that's true.

36:41.850 --> 36:43.200
My knight in shining armor.

36:44.225 --> 36:45.531
I'm gonna go get some Pringles.

36:45.793 --> 36:47.239
Alright, good luck.

37:02.955 --> 37:04.073
How was the movie?

37:07.256 --> 37:08.993
If I was on leave, that 'cause of you.*

37:09.481 --> 37:11.067
I ain't telling what I would have done.

37:13.586 --> 37:15.236
What the hell are you doing here?

37:15.820 --> 37:17.304
Why are you hanging out with a loser?

37:18.543 --> 37:19.606
We could have us some fun.

37:22.955 --> 37:24.201
Don't touch me.

37:24.565 --> 37:26.447
You get away from me!

37:26.709 --> 37:28.032
Get away from me!

37:34.881 --> 37:35.907
Get off her!

37:40.848 --> 37:42.164
I'm gonna be back for you.

38:09.671 --> 38:11.033
Oh my God.

38:28.812 --> 38:31.762
What are we supposed to do now?
We gotta go to the hospital.

38:34.805 --> 38:36.420
Tyra, what did I do?

38:43.869 --> 38:45.409
He's not--
Tyra, where the hospital?

38:45.522 --> 38:47.259
The hospital's close, I swear.

38:50.107 --> 38:51.487
He stopped breathing, Tyra.

38:52.247 --> 38:53.252
He's dead.

39:03.203 --> 39:04.211
I killed him.

39:06.527 --> 39:09.800
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna call my dad. He's a cop.

39:10.062 --> 39:12.418
- He'll know how--
- No, just stop it.

39:53.220 --> 39:54.678
Tyra, we're not-- We can't--

39:55.060 --> 39:56.680
I mean, we can't.

39:56.942 --> 39:58.337
What else are we gonna do?

41:37.648 --> 41:40.158
<i>Presenting the 2006 championship ring</i>

41:40.420 --> 41:42.160
<i>to Bradley Colby, Greg Rawlins.</i>

42:21.010 --> 42:24.447
The next championship ring
presented Mathew Saracen.
