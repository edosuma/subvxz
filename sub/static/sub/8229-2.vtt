09:20.367 --> 09:21.832
and go through the floor,
as well,

09:21.833 --> 09:23.532
it feels
a little ludicrous to me.

09:23.533 --> 09:25.332
I think that we're gonna get
just through the roof,

09:25.333 --> 09:26.699
and that's it.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.299
Narrator:
Kari's instincts say no.

09:28.300 --> 09:31.732
But with a 700-pound piano
dropping from 50 feet

09:31.733 --> 09:36.666
and striking the roof
with a force of 12,000 pounds,

09:36.667 --> 09:39.466
it's gonna be hard-hitting.

09:39.467 --> 09:41.332
Okay.
Here we go.

09:41.333 --> 09:43.799
This is
"upright piano at 50 feet

09:43.800 --> 09:45.632
dropped through a house"

09:45.633 --> 09:48.466
in 3, 2, 1.

09:48.467 --> 09:50.266
Oh.

09:50.267 --> 09:52.599
Oh!
Oh! Ooh!

09:52.600 --> 09:55.066
Off the roof.
Off the other roof!

09:55.067 --> 09:57.766
Nothing but concrete.

09:57.767 --> 09:59.166
Wow.
Listen to that bounce.

09:59.167 --> 10:00.299
It's still playing.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.599
It's still going,
but that's the music of...

10:02.600 --> 10:03.866
Yeah.
I think i know this tune...

10:03.867 --> 10:05.199
"busted."

10:05.200 --> 10:09.032
Narrator: It seems the upright
piano was too low-key.

10:09.033 --> 10:10.932
Despite the force of the fall,

10:10.933 --> 10:13.799
it wasn't enough
to carry the tune.

10:13.800 --> 10:15.932
But is there more to this myth?

10:15.933 --> 10:18.132
I think we're gonna need
a bigger piano.

10:18.133 --> 10:19.133
Yep.

10:19.134 --> 10:20.666
Oh.

10:20.667 --> 10:21.699
Oh!

10:21.700 --> 10:22.866
Tory: Wow.
Look at that.

10:22.867 --> 10:24.599
We splintered the beams.

10:24.600 --> 10:27.366
I think what happened was, there
was so much flex in the roof

10:27.367 --> 10:29.532
that we weren't able
to punch through.

10:29.533 --> 10:32.500
So now i think
we need a bigger piano.

10:37.100 --> 10:38.799
Narrator: Coming up...

10:38.800 --> 10:42.366
The mythbusters hit home
with more domestic disasters.

10:42.367 --> 10:44.132
Adam:
Come on, water heater.

10:44.133 --> 10:45.633
Whoa!

10:54.267 --> 10:55.466
Narrator: Sunscreen.

10:55.467 --> 10:56.899
It's meant
to keep you from burning.

10:56.900 --> 10:58.832
Man: Mm-hmm!

10:58.833 --> 11:00.499
Narrator:
But could it actually give you

11:00.500 --> 11:02.932
a very painful kind of tan?

11:02.933 --> 11:05.099
So far in this episode,
our experiments

11:05.100 --> 11:07.499
have been concentrated
around the aerosolization

11:07.500 --> 11:08.766
of spray sunscreen.

11:08.767 --> 11:10.732
That is, when it creates
a bilious cloud

11:10.733 --> 11:14.332
that gets near an open flame and
can cause a whooshing fireball.

11:14.333 --> 11:16.166
Hey.
We caught him on fire.

11:16.167 --> 11:17.632
But that's not
the only mechanism

11:17.633 --> 11:20.099
by which we've heard these
sunscreens can be dangerous.

11:20.100 --> 11:22.466
We've heard reports
of people applying it

11:22.467 --> 11:25.099
and then, minutes later,
approaching an open flame

11:25.100 --> 11:26.599
and then catching on fire...

11:26.600 --> 11:30.232
That it may remain flammable
for a period of time.

11:30.233 --> 11:33.132
But to test this, we can't use
our fiberglass mannequin

11:33.133 --> 11:34.566
'cause its skin is hard.

11:34.567 --> 11:38.066
We need a more realistic
human analogue to skin

11:38.067 --> 11:40.132
that can absorb our sunscreen.

11:40.133 --> 11:43.099
Ready for your 15 minutes
of fame, little piggy?

11:43.100 --> 11:44.599
Like that guy.

11:44.600 --> 11:47.632
Narrator: The suggestion is
that propellant-based sunscreen

11:47.633 --> 11:50.932
stays flammable
long after application.

11:50.933 --> 11:51.966
Let's get to grilling.

11:51.967 --> 11:54.099
There we go.

11:54.100 --> 11:57.666
Narrator: But is that a scenario
that will bring home the bacon?

11:57.667 --> 12:01.299
Now we wait a little bit,
let the fat start to fry.

12:01.300 --> 12:04.066
Jamie: For the first test,
we're gonna apply the sunscreen

12:04.067 --> 12:07.699
and then wait three minutes
before we expose it to flame.

12:07.700 --> 12:09.166
All right, dude.
I think we're close.

12:09.167 --> 12:10.532
You want to get ready
to spray him

12:10.533 --> 12:11.699
and then count down
three minutes?

12:11.700 --> 12:12.732
Okeydokey.

12:12.733 --> 12:14.499
So, how might it be
that sunscreen

12:14.500 --> 12:16.666
remains flammable
once applied to the skin?

12:16.667 --> 12:17.667
A whole bunch.

12:17.668 --> 12:19.266
All the way down the arm, too.

12:19.267 --> 12:22.299
Well, solvents are used to
dissolve the oils and minerals

12:22.300 --> 12:23.899
and carry them in suspension.

12:23.900 --> 12:26.466
And that is usually
denatured alcohol

12:26.467 --> 12:29.666
at concentrations up to 75%.

12:29.667 --> 12:32.299
And as we know,
alcohol is very flammable.

12:32.300 --> 12:35.299
Narrator: That's the theory,
and three minutes later...

12:35.300 --> 12:36.332
Three minutes.

12:36.333 --> 12:38.332
Porky has to sweat it out.

12:38.333 --> 12:41.832
All right.
Here we go, pig.

12:41.833 --> 12:43.366
Adam fans the flames,

12:43.367 --> 12:47.666
but will the sunscreen
still be flammable?

12:47.667 --> 12:48.799
Nothing.
No.

12:48.800 --> 12:50.266
Nothing, man.

12:50.267 --> 12:53.066
Uh [Chuckles] no.

12:53.067 --> 12:55.266
Three minutes,
i don't think you're flammable.

12:55.267 --> 12:56.267
Time to do one minute.

12:56.268 --> 12:57.599
Let's go for broke.

12:57.600 --> 13:02.299
Next, they slap on
a whole lot more sunscreen...

13:02.300 --> 13:03.599
[ Spray hissing ]

13:03.600 --> 13:07.132
and this time, grab
the grill after just 60 seconds.

Time's up.
[ Beep ]

13:08.867 --> 13:10.167

13:15.833 --> 13:17.066
Ah.

13:17.067 --> 13:19.766
One minute... nothing.
Nope.

13:19.767 --> 13:22.666
We've tested the application of
the spray sunscreen on our pig

13:22.667 --> 13:24.199
and exposed him
to a barbecue fire

13:24.200 --> 13:26.766
after three minutes
and one minute

13:26.767 --> 13:30.799
and, so far, have yet to achieve
any kind of burning pork.

13:30.800 --> 13:33.466
Now we're going to do it
nearly instantaneously.

13:33.467 --> 13:35.499
We're going to apply
the sunscreen to our pig,

13:35.500 --> 13:38.332
wait about five seconds for
the bilious cloud to disperse,

13:38.333 --> 13:40.532
and then bring in
the barbecue flames.

13:40.533 --> 13:42.300
Here we go.
Okay.

13:45.067 --> 13:46.699
There.
He's on fire.

13:46.700 --> 13:47.866
Is he on fire?

13:47.867 --> 13:50.899
Oh! My goodness!

13:50.900 --> 13:53.166
[ Laughs ]

13:53.167 --> 13:55.799
Narrator:
So as porky feels the burn,

13:55.800 --> 13:58.299
there's definitely
a residual risk,

13:58.300 --> 14:01.499
but it's only five seconds
after application.

14:01.500 --> 14:03.732
Jamie: So, it seems
that the alcohol in these sprays

14:03.733 --> 14:05.766
is evaporating very rapidly.

14:05.767 --> 14:07.532
But if you spray yourself down

14:07.533 --> 14:10.866
and then immediately expose
that sprayed area

14:10.867 --> 14:12.966
to an open source of flame
like the grill,

14:12.967 --> 14:17.300
you could be in serious trouble,
like our guy.

14:22.800 --> 14:25.866

the ivories once again,

14:25.867 --> 14:29.266
first,
a different domestic disaster.

14:29.267 --> 14:32.666
Okay. A vacuum cleaner.
And is that black powder?

14:32.667 --> 14:34.132
It is. All right.
Let me explain.

14:34.133 --> 14:35.299
Now, this myth is about a guy

14:35.300 --> 14:37.632
who's making his own ammo
in his living room.

14:37.633 --> 14:39.766
He knocks over a bunch
of black powder on the carpet,

14:39.767 --> 14:41.132
decides to vacuum it up.

14:41.133 --> 14:43.099
But something
in the vacuum cleaner

14:43.100 --> 14:44.932
ignites the black powder,
and the whole thing explodes.

14:44.933 --> 14:46.899
No way.

14:46.900 --> 14:49.532
Man, this has "mythbusters"
written all over it.

14:49.533 --> 14:51.066
Narrator:
It's a household hazard

14:51.067 --> 14:53.166
that you can't sweep
under the rug.

14:53.167 --> 14:58.366
But will sucking up black powder
really bring the house down?

14:58.367 --> 15:00.432
Well, at the bomb range...

15:00.433 --> 15:03.066

It's perfect.

15:14.433 --> 15:16.366

15:28.600 --> 15:30.332
Narrator:
So, now to bring in the vacuums.

15:30.333 --> 15:35.066
But how could something built
to suck ignite the black powder?

15:35.067 --> 15:36.932
Well, number one,

15:36.933 --> 15:40.066
you have an electric motor
that's generating heat.

15:40.067 --> 15:44.432
Number two, you have rotating
parts moving at high speed.

15:44.433 --> 15:46.966
You could form
static electricity,

15:46.967 --> 15:49.066
and a static discharge
could set it off.

15:49.067 --> 15:51.866
And finally, there could be
an electrical problem

15:51.867 --> 15:53.299
inside of the vacuum,

15:53.300 --> 15:57.466
causing a large amount of heat
to be generated in a small area.

15:57.467 --> 16:01.099
Narrator: And because
of that unholy Trinity...

16:01.100 --> 16:03.499
Ah. A mythbuster's job
is never done.

16:03.500 --> 16:06.966
Narrator: The team is opting
for some hands-free hoovering.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.232
So, this is
how it's gonna go down.

16:08.233 --> 16:11.199
We are gonna be vacuuming up
a pound of black powder.

16:11.200 --> 16:12.599
That's a lot of black powder,

16:12.600 --> 16:14.866
and the vacuum cleaner
could potentially explode.

16:14.867 --> 16:16.932
So we'll be operating it
remotely

16:16.933 --> 16:19.132
with my vacuuming robot.

a faulty hot water heater...

is very, very dangerous.

as the water heater

20:35.200 --> 20:36.999
is about to blow, a fire starts.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.932
Then, in some crazy coincidence,

20:38.933 --> 20:41.199
just as the fire
as reaching its peak,

20:41.200 --> 20:44.166

and bang.

20:44.167 --> 20:45.632
No more fire.

20:45.633 --> 20:48.632

extinguishes the fire?

20:51.233 --> 20:52.999

to blow
at a very specific point...

38:11.767 --> 38:13.799
and detonate
this hot water heater

38:13.800 --> 38:15.699
and get done
with this experiment,

38:15.700 --> 38:17.499
all without causing a fire,
of course.

38:17.500 --> 38:19.632
Narrator: Yep.
And with the switch flicked...

38:19.633 --> 38:22.632
And here we go.

38:22.633 --> 38:24.632
Narrator:
And the water heater heating,

38:24.633 --> 38:26.099
the sun rises,

38:26.100 --> 38:30.232
and the emergency crews prepare
for the worst-case scenario.

38:30.233 --> 38:32.099
We expect that the building

38:32.100 --> 38:36.799
may simply, like, not be
an interior structure anymore.

38:36.800 --> 38:38.599
And be aware that that's
a dangerous structure

38:38.600 --> 38:40.632
that could drop
on anybody that goes in.

38:40.633 --> 38:43.532
I would recommend watching
for large objects

38:43.533 --> 38:46.132
like that furniture
that's traveling some distance.

38:46.133 --> 38:48.866
That's the worst thing
that we can see that happens,

38:48.867 --> 38:50.532
as far
as putting the fire out there.

38:50.533 --> 38:52.566
Adam: The sun is up.

38:52.567 --> 38:53.732
It's nice and early morning.

38:53.733 --> 38:55.366
And we are pretty much
at "go" time.

38:55.367 --> 38:57.732
The hot water heater
is pressured to 105 p.S.I.,

38:57.733 --> 38:59.132
which is
within its safety rating.

38:59.133 --> 39:00.332
But that is time for us

39:00.333 --> 39:02.066
to all get under the safety
of a bunker.

39:02.067 --> 39:03.899
I'm sitting at ground zero
at the couch

39:03.900 --> 39:05.266
where my wastepaper basket

39:05.267 --> 39:07.632
is properly fueled
with some newspaper,

39:07.633 --> 39:10.266
ready to set fire
to the couch and the curtains.

39:10.267 --> 39:11.766
We're not much more
than 10 minutes away.

39:11.767 --> 39:14.666
I must admit,
I'm a little excited.

39:14.667 --> 39:17.732
Narrator: The mythbusters
fall back to the bunker

39:17.733 --> 39:21.066
because, soon, that water heater
is gonna blow.

39:21.067 --> 39:23.566
Jamie:
We are at 200 p.S.I.

39:23.567 --> 39:25.266
Narrator: The question is,

39:25.267 --> 39:27.532
will it extinguish
the impending fire?

39:27.533 --> 39:30.332
This is command central.

39:30.333 --> 39:32.699
We've got
a view of the ignition point.

39:32.700 --> 39:36.866
We've got a view of the room
where we expect the fire occur.

39:36.867 --> 39:40.266
We've got our ignition switch
and our pressure meter.

39:40.267 --> 39:42.799
We're all set.

39:42.800 --> 39:45.632
It's nice when our gauges match.

39:45.633 --> 39:47.632
I personally think the fire's

39:47.633 --> 39:50.666
gonna take
about 2, 2 1/2 minutes

39:50.667 --> 39:52.899
to get
to the point of no return.

39:52.900 --> 39:55.299
And i think
that our hot water heater

39:55.300 --> 39:57.299
is going to put it out
when it explodes,

39:57.300 --> 40:00.566
but i think it's also
going to destroy the house.

40:00.567 --> 40:03.332
This is the most tense part
of the operation.

40:03.333 --> 40:06.032
So, i think it will be
a plus and a minus

40:06.033 --> 40:09.899
all at the same time,
but we'll find out soon enough.

40:09.900 --> 40:11.766
Narrator: After 1 1/2 hours,

40:11.767 --> 40:15.099
the tank is closing in
on the explosive butter zone.

40:15.100 --> 40:17.999
So it's over
to our fire starter.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
All right.
Here we go.

40:19.001 --> 40:20.299
Setting the fire.

40:20.300 --> 40:22.799
3, 2, 1.
[ Click ]

40:22.800 --> 40:25.399
Uh.
Jamie: Oh.

40:25.400 --> 40:26.666
Worked like a charm.

40:26.667 --> 40:27.732
That worked...
Holy crap.

40:27.733 --> 40:28.932
Wow.

40:28.933 --> 40:32.699
Inside the house,
the flames quickly take hold.

40:32.700 --> 40:34.932
The smoke is obscuring.

40:34.933 --> 40:35.999
It's still going strong,

40:36.000 --> 40:38.399
but it's obscuring
my upper camera.

40:38.400 --> 40:42.432
And with the fire raging and
the water heater at 300 p.S.I.,

40:42.433 --> 40:46.132
they're ready to fight
one disaster with another.

40:46.133 --> 40:47.266
All right.

40:47.267 --> 40:48.599
Jamie, I'm gonna give you
the countdown.

40:48.600 --> 40:50.566
Are you ready?
You got a good fire?

40:50.567 --> 40:51.666
Yeah.
I've got a good fire.

40:51.667 --> 40:54.366
All right.
Here we go.

40:54.367 --> 40:55.532
Fire in the hole.

40:55.533 --> 40:57.399
We are going to blow
this hot water heater

40:57.400 --> 40:59.666
in 5...

40:59.667 --> 41:01.066

2...

41:03.133 --> 41:04.966
1. Go!

41:04.967 --> 41:06.133
Come on back in.

41:10.067 --> 41:12.932
Come on.
Come on, water heater.

41:12.933 --> 41:14.599
Whoa!

41:14.600 --> 41:15.899
It's up.
It's up. It's up.

41:15.900 --> 41:17.066
I don't...
I see it.

41:17.067 --> 41:18.767
I see it.
It's coming down.

41:19.800 --> 41:21.366
Wham!

41:21.367 --> 41:22.766
It landed on the land.

41:22.767 --> 41:24.666
[ Laughs ]

41:24.667 --> 41:26.666
[ Laughing ]
There's no house left.

41:26.667 --> 41:29.066
I don't see any fire, though.

41:29.067 --> 41:30.466
I see some smoke.

41:30.467 --> 41:34.866
That was
clearly a household disaster,

41:34.867 --> 41:37.399
and initially,
it looks like the water heater

41:37.400 --> 41:40.232
extinguished the fire.

41:40.233 --> 41:43.400
However,
once the dust settles...

41:44.900 --> 41:47.666
Looks like we still have
a little bit of a fire.

41:47.667 --> 41:51.167
Doesn't look like the water
heater helped out very much.

41:57.867 --> 42:01.266
Jamie: Fire chief,
for your information,

42:01.267 --> 42:02.766
we have extinguished the fire,

42:02.767 --> 42:04.432
but there's still
some smoldering.

42:04.433 --> 42:06.266
So a little water here and there

42:06.267 --> 42:09.266
would take care
of finishing it off.

42:09.267 --> 42:11.366
Narrator:
And as the fire crew

42:11.367 --> 42:13.466
put out
the smoldering wreckage...

42:13.467 --> 42:16.366
This is
why we can't have nice things.

42:16.367 --> 42:18.966
Narrator: It's clear
an exploding water heater

42:18.967 --> 42:21.932
is not a fire extinguisher.

42:21.933 --> 42:23.866
That could not have been
more spectacular.

42:23.867 --> 42:25.466
We had one household disaster,

42:25.467 --> 42:27.899
a small fire
started in a wastebasket,

42:27.900 --> 42:30.099
compounded by a second
household disaster,

42:30.100 --> 42:32.666
an exploding hot water heater...

42:32.667 --> 42:34.699
That caused a third,

42:34.700 --> 42:38.299
and ultimately fatal
to the house, disaster...

42:38.300 --> 42:40.600
That is,
completely destroying the house.

42:42.333 --> 42:44.066
Remember,
the whole point of this

42:44.067 --> 42:46.066
was to find out if one household
disaster, the water heater,

42:46.067 --> 42:48.766
could countermand the other one,
the fire.

42:48.767 --> 42:50.366
Not only didn't it...

42:50.367 --> 42:54.066
It also took the entire house
out while it went.

42:54.067 --> 42:55.699
Fantastic result.

42:55.700 --> 42:57.899
I can't make an okay sign
with this hand.

42:57.900 --> 42:59.066
Yes!

42:59.067 --> 43:00.332
What amazes me

43:00.333 --> 43:03.466
is that there were
no explosives involved here.

43:03.467 --> 43:07.632
This little piece of sheet
metal, though, did that.

43:07.633 --> 43:09.599
Did it put out the fire?

43:09.600 --> 43:10.699
Some of it.

43:10.700 --> 43:13.299
Did we save the house?

43:13.300 --> 43:14.866
Oops.

43:14.867 --> 43:16.232
Well, i think
it's pretty obvious

43:16.233 --> 43:17.299
that we should call this.

43:17.300 --> 43:19.099
What do you think?
Yep.

43:19.100 --> 43:20.632
What do you think, guys?

43:20.633 --> 43:21.899
Together: Busted!
