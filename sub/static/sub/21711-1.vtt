00:20.271 --> 00:24.233
'Thank you for being here
with us, with the groom and the bride.

00:24.358 --> 00:27.278
'Come and dance with us, everyone.
Let's begin.

00:28.529 --> 00:31.741
'As they say, here we have
the most beautiful women in Laredo.'

00:31.866 --> 00:33.993
- Congratulations, Danny.
- Thank you for coming.

00:34.118 --> 00:34.910
Congratulations.

00:52.553 --> 00:56.015
The last time I saw Danny, he was riding
a big wheel down the sidewalk.

00:56.140 --> 00:58.601
It means a lot to your <i>tía</i>
that you're here.

00:58.726 --> 01:00.227
- Don Chucho.
- Luis, how are you?

01:00.352 --> 01:01.479
How are you, sir?

01:02.021 --> 01:03.355
- Javi.
- Hey, Luis.

01:03.481 --> 01:06.400
We heard about what you did in Colombia.
We sure are proud of you.

01:06.525 --> 01:09.070
- Thanks, Luis. Have a good night.
- You, too.

01:09.195 --> 01:10.571
Hello, Paco.

01:14.492 --> 01:17.119
Everyone in Laredo is at this thing.

01:17.244 --> 01:18.412
Hey!

01:25.002 --> 01:26.295
Be right back, Pops.

01:28.589 --> 01:31.217
- Here you go, sweetheart. You got that?
- Yummy!

01:31.342 --> 01:33.177
Hey, Lorraine.

01:35.429 --> 01:37.890
Javi. Heard you were back.

01:38.015 --> 01:40.184
I mean, the whole town's talking about it.

01:40.935 --> 01:44.146
- I had some time off.
- Decided to spend it here?

01:48.818 --> 01:50.236
Actually, I'm...

01:51.695 --> 01:53.072
trying to quit.

01:53.823 --> 01:55.199
Doing the Nicorette thing.

01:55.324 --> 01:57.910
Look at you. A whole new man.

02:06.001 --> 02:07.294
Listen, Lorraine...

02:10.881 --> 02:12.842
I just wanted to say
I've thought about things...

02:13.843 --> 02:15.719
and I'm real sorry about all of it.

02:15.845 --> 02:17.805
You waited ten years
to tell me you're sorry?

02:18.681 --> 02:19.849
I know what I did.

02:22.351 --> 02:23.394
I was... um...

02:27.148 --> 02:28.357
It was wrong.

02:30.943 --> 02:32.778
I forgave you a long time ago, Javi.

02:33.571 --> 02:35.072
The truth is, I'm grateful.

02:36.115 --> 02:38.033
I ended up where I'm supposed to be.

02:39.201 --> 02:40.161
Maybe we both did.

02:40.911 --> 02:43.539
If you hadn't come into my life
and disappeared from it,

02:43.664 --> 02:45.291
none of that would have
ever happened.

02:46.250 --> 02:48.711
Can you imagine
if we were actually married?

02:51.755 --> 02:54.258
- Here you go, baby.
- Thank you.

02:54.383 --> 02:56.635
- Hey, Jav.
- Randy.

02:57.511 --> 02:58.470
- How are you?
- Good.

02:58.596 --> 03:01.265
Yeah, I just... I just wanted to say hi.

03:01.390 --> 03:02.391
Yeah.

03:04.351 --> 03:05.352
You hungry?

03:06.187 --> 03:08.647
Oh, you are getting so big.

03:20.701 --> 03:24.622
I know you didn't like it tonight,
all the attention, but...

03:25.331 --> 03:27.833
folks want to pay their respects.

03:27.958 --> 03:29.585
You're a hero to them.

03:32.087 --> 03:33.714
I'm not a hero.

03:57.363 --> 03:59.531
Will you tell me something?

04:03.452 --> 04:05.079
What happened to you over there?

04:05.204 --> 04:08.540
- Dad, I don't know. It got ugly.
- But you want to go back?

04:18.676 --> 04:21.720
When you were a kid, a little guy,

04:22.554 --> 04:26.517
all you wanted to do was get out of here,
out into the world.

04:27.309 --> 04:29.561
But you didn't like what you found.

04:30.104 --> 04:31.522
A lot of people don't.

04:32.314 --> 04:34.066
But don't try to change it.

04:35.901 --> 04:38.404
More likely, it'll change you.

04:40.030 --> 04:42.032
It was right here, wasn't it?

04:43.951 --> 04:45.869
The last time we had this conversation.

04:45.995 --> 04:48.455
You didn't listen to me then, either.

04:49.456 --> 04:50.833
Nope.

04:57.047 --> 04:58.215
So, Cali.

05:02.344 --> 05:03.679
Cali.

06:41.360 --> 06:42.945
Sir, here you are.

06:43.779 --> 06:44.780
Thank you.

06:53.831 --> 06:55.124
'I'm not a hero.

06:55.582 --> 06:58.377
'There were some
in the hunt for Escobar.

06:58.502 --> 07:00.337
'A lot, actually.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.631
'But it's tough to see them
through all the blood.

07:03.674 --> 07:07.261
'To kill a monster, sometimes you have
to get in bed with other monsters.

07:07.719 --> 07:10.389
'If that surprises you,
pick up a history book.

07:11.056 --> 07:11.890
'It's what we do.

07:12.891 --> 07:17.438
'The enemy of my enemy is my friend,
until he becomes my enemy again.

07:17.563 --> 07:20.399
'When that happens, God help them.

07:21.525 --> 07:25.821
'The day Pablo went down, the Cali cartel
became Public Enemy Number One.

07:25.946 --> 07:29.324
'And the fact that they helped us
bring him down didn't mean shit.'

07:29.825 --> 07:33.537
Many observers fear Colombia's
other large cartel, the Cali cartel,

07:33.662 --> 07:35.873
will now simply step up
its own drug production.

07:35.998 --> 07:37.291
'And that's exactly
what happened.

07:37.875 --> 07:39.334
'While the whole world
was focused on Escobar,

07:39.460 --> 07:43.130
'Cali's operations
had grown exponentially,

07:43.255 --> 07:45.591
'differing from their rival
in every possible way.

07:46.592 --> 07:49.970
'Where Pablo sought the love and
protection of the masses of Medellín,

07:50.095 --> 07:52.306
'these guys rubbed shoulders
with Colombia's elite

07:52.431 --> 07:55.100
'and called themselves
"The Gentlemen of Cali".

07:55.601 --> 07:59.605
'And whereas Escobar craved the spotlight,
these guys stayed in the shadows,

07:59.730 --> 08:01.607
'perfecting the game,

08:01.732 --> 08:05.903
'building complex smuggling
and distribution networks through Mexico,

08:06.028 --> 08:10.949
'Europe, and the Far East,
without leaving so much as a fingerprint.

08:11.074 --> 08:14.328
'Even the people working for them didn't
know it was Cali coke they were moving.

08:14.453 --> 08:16.872
'It was fucking Cocaine, Incorporated.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.500
'And they ran it
like a Fortune 500 company.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.794
'So, without further ado,

08:22.920 --> 08:25.422
'meet the management team
of the Cali cartel:

08:27.090 --> 08:30.427
'Pacho Herrera,
head of distribution and security.

08:30.552 --> 08:31.595
Hello?

08:31.720 --> 08:35.015
'He led a team of young psychopaths
who would do anything he asked.'

08:35.140 --> 08:37.226
Yes. What's up?

08:38.018 --> 08:39.895
'Chepe Santacruz-Londoño.'

08:40.020 --> 08:42.689
Let's see.

08:42.814 --> 08:45.108
'Grew up with the Rodríguez brothers.

08:47.778 --> 08:49.613
'He was in charge of U.S. operations

08:49.738 --> 08:54.326
'and responsible for Cali's crown jewel:
New York City.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.914
'He actually lived there,
under an assumed name, of course.

08:59.831 --> 09:03.377
'Cartel's number two was operations chief:
Miguel Rodríguez.'

09:03.502 --> 09:05.295
Palmira's police superintendent.

09:05.420 --> 09:06.547
Didn't we just take care of him?

09:06.672 --> 09:09.633
- I'm talking about the new one, Arango.
- How much?

09:09.758 --> 09:11.385
- Should I put $20,000?
- No.

09:12.678 --> 09:14.471
Put 17.

09:14.596 --> 09:16.557
- Seventeen?
- Yes.

09:16.682 --> 09:18.976
'Miguel watched over
all the money coming in,

09:19.101 --> 09:21.061
'and what bribes they were paying out.

09:21.770 --> 09:27.901
'And last but not least, cartel CEO,
the man with the plan: Gilberto Rodríguez.

09:28.026 --> 09:31.446
'They called him the Chess Player,
because he was always one move ahead.

09:33.115 --> 09:37.244
'They were the pinnacle of trafficking
evolution. Apex drug dealers.

09:37.369 --> 09:39.705
'And being number two
allowed them to quietly grow

09:39.830 --> 09:42.791
'into the biggest cocaine cartel
in history.

09:42.916 --> 09:45.002
'Except now, that was over.

09:45.127 --> 09:47.588
'Now that the guy that occupied
our attention was gone,

09:47.713 --> 09:50.173
'they were number one
with a fucking bullet.

09:51.592 --> 09:54.553
'And there was no chess move
that would get them out of it.

09:54.678 --> 09:57.014
'But I was looking forward
to seeing them try.'

09:57.139 --> 10:00.934
Anderson!
Move all that over to the left.

10:01.059 --> 10:02.936
The tables are too close together.

10:09.192 --> 10:11.403
Are you planning on saying
anything tonight?

10:12.988 --> 10:13.989
No.

10:15.616 --> 10:16.825
I'll speak for the both of us.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.453
- Did you talk to the North Valley people?
- Yes.

10:22.122 --> 10:22.914
And?

10:23.040 --> 10:25.542
They said what they thought
I wanted to hear.

10:25.667 --> 10:28.962
But tonight, after the announcement,
we'll know the truth.

10:32.174 --> 10:34.676
You're more superstitious
than Aunt Luz.

11:01.536 --> 11:03.955
- Hey, boss.
- Is everything ready?

11:04.414 --> 11:05.248
Yes, sir.

11:06.166 --> 11:09.252
It took all night, but... it's ready, sir.

11:09.378 --> 11:11.630
You can handle it, you're young.

11:17.844 --> 11:21.890
We're meeting Córdova.
He wants to go over the game plan.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.101
Big night tonight, right?

11:25.602 --> 11:27.062
Lots of company.

11:42.953 --> 11:45.664
Gentlemen.
Let's start with the obvious.

11:46.248 --> 11:48.333
Tonight is fucking important.

11:48.917 --> 11:50.877
The Rodríguez brothers never

11:51.002 --> 11:53.630
gather members of their organisation
in one place.

11:54.506 --> 11:57.843
That simply never happens.
But tonight, they're going to do it.

11:59.511 --> 12:00.929
So we have to be sharp.

12:02.139 --> 12:04.641
- Eyes in the back of the head, understood?
- Yes, sir.

12:04.766 --> 12:07.686
- Jorge.
- Stay focused.

12:07.811 --> 12:10.188
Stay on the radio. Communicate.

12:10.772 --> 12:12.566
Tonight is his last operation.

12:13.525 --> 12:17.612
He's leaving us
to become a fancy businessman.

12:18.071 --> 12:22.451
Let's leave a good impression.
Maybe he'll hire us one day.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.245
Let's go.

12:32.502 --> 12:35.756
What do you think Gilberto
is going to announce tonight?

12:36.757 --> 12:39.217
I think it's a move into the Asian market.

12:39.342 --> 12:43.138
I have no idea.
After Friday, it's not my problem.

12:43.263 --> 12:47.058
- Are you really leaving?
- I promised Paola.

12:49.311 --> 12:52.397
I promise things to my wife
every day, brother.

12:53.857 --> 12:56.234
Relax, you'll find someone else
to make you look good.

12:57.694 --> 12:58.987
I hope so, buddy.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.948
Because right now,
I'm surrounded by a bunch of assholes.

13:12.667 --> 13:14.503
'Congratulations on the promotion, sir.'

13:15.295 --> 13:16.755
Tell me what you do again.

13:16.880 --> 13:19.591
I'm the deputy country attaché.
I'll also be your driver.

13:20.342 --> 13:21.760
I drive myself.

13:23.637 --> 13:27.140
You know, you're kind of a big deal
around here. Since Escobar.

13:27.891 --> 13:29.726
- Katie.
- Good morning.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.606
Sir, can I ask?

13:35.065 --> 13:36.775
What was Escobar like?

13:37.400 --> 13:39.194
Never met him.

13:41.112 --> 13:43.907
'Just because we'd been focused
on Escobar the past few years

13:44.032 --> 13:46.785
'didn't mean we were completely
ignoring the Cali godfathers.'

13:46.910 --> 13:50.121
I want updates from Duffy and Lopez
on where we're at with Cornerstone.

13:50.247 --> 13:51.248
- ASAP.
- Yes, sir.

14:01.967 --> 14:03.927
Those are our intelligence summaries
on the Cali cartel.

14:04.052 --> 14:06.596
I don't want summaries.
Where's everything else?

14:06.721 --> 14:09.516
'We had agents on them
the whole time.

14:09.641 --> 14:11.268
'Good agents.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.771
'And recently, we had gotten lucky.'

14:16.982 --> 14:18.942
You got some kind of medical condition?

14:20.986 --> 14:22.279
No, I got one.

14:22.404 --> 14:24.239
'The latest break
in the case against Cali

14:24.364 --> 14:27.909
'came from a joint Customs-DEA
operation called Cornerstone.

14:30.370 --> 14:33.665
'And it put a lot of mid-level Cali guys
behind bars in the States.

14:35.876 --> 14:38.086
'And while they weren't eager to help us,

14:38.211 --> 14:41.006
'you could always count
on some poor relative in Colombia...'

14:42.757 --> 14:46.344
'...who would do whatever it takes
to get their brother or son back home.'

14:46.845 --> 14:48.430
Who am I speaking with?

14:48.555 --> 14:50.432
'And if that sounds harsh,
that's because it is.'

14:50.557 --> 14:52.183
This is Andres, his brother.

14:52.309 --> 14:54.102
'The DEA doesn't fuck around.'

14:54.227 --> 14:56.104
And how can I help him?

15:08.825 --> 15:09.951
Here we go.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.372
Hey, brother. Have a seat.

15:17.709 --> 15:19.169
Something to drink?

15:22.589 --> 15:25.258
You're fine, brother.
Nobody out here knows us.

15:25.383 --> 15:27.093
Cali cops don't even know we're here.

15:27.218 --> 15:29.387
Relax. You're safe here.

15:29.512 --> 15:31.222
Lay it on him.

15:31.348 --> 15:33.642
Let's talk about tonight's party.

15:33.767 --> 15:36.353
We need info on the people attending.

15:36.937 --> 15:38.480
Cops, politicians.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.357
- Cops and politicians?
- Yes.

15:40.482 --> 15:44.569
Who work for the cartel.
These people are ruining your country.

15:45.695 --> 15:47.113
And the why. Tell him.

15:48.323 --> 15:53.370
Look, the thing is, these people
never get together in one place.

15:53.495 --> 15:56.164
We need to know why now.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.583
Our guess is Gilberto Rodríguez

15:59.167 --> 16:01.461
is making some kind
of important announcement.

16:02.087 --> 16:03.797
Understand?

16:05.382 --> 16:08.385
If no... bye-bye,<i>hermano.</i>

16:15.892 --> 16:18.395
- How are things in Texas, Agent Peña?
- Hot.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.316
How's the family? You know,
you had a few more weeks off coming.

16:23.900 --> 16:25.068
You could've spent more time at home.

16:25.193 --> 16:27.529
Yeah, well, I guess they couldn't wait
to get rid of me.

16:29.030 --> 16:34.452
Sir, this operation in Miami,
Cornerstone, shook some leads loose.

16:34.577 --> 16:36.121
Could be a break on Cali.

16:37.163 --> 16:40.750
- Anyone testifying?
- No, but it put an asset in play.

16:41.876 --> 16:44.921
Could shed some light
on their next move.

16:49.634 --> 16:52.595
Things won't be like Escobar,
Agent Peña.

16:53.138 --> 16:55.974
It can't be.
Things have changed down here.

16:56.099 --> 16:57.434
New President coming in.

16:58.101 --> 17:00.228
Gaviria put up with things
that this guy might not.

17:03.273 --> 17:04.566
Just take it a little slowly.

17:04.691 --> 17:07.444
Get your feet under you,
get used to the new job.

17:09.612 --> 17:12.949
Sir, the CIA station chief...

17:14.117 --> 17:15.952
he and I have history.

17:16.786 --> 17:18.663
I'm hoping it won't be an issue
moving forward.

17:18.788 --> 17:20.665
I know you and Stechner
have your differences.

17:20.790 --> 17:23.376
- It won't be a problem.
- I'm not sure I share your confidence.

17:23.501 --> 17:25.587
Stechner signed off
on your appointment.

17:26.671 --> 17:28.339
In fact, he wanted you back.

17:29.132 --> 17:32.886
The CIA and the DEA need
to work together on this one.

17:33.011 --> 17:34.512
We have the same goal.

17:52.363 --> 17:53.531
Come in.

17:58.286 --> 17:59.287
<i>Hola,</i> brother.

17:59.996 --> 18:02.457
We were starting to worry.
Everything cool?

18:02.582 --> 18:05.710
We were getting worried.
Everything okay?

18:05.835 --> 18:08.129
Yes, but...
I thought someone was tailing me.

18:08.254 --> 18:11.174
- He thinks he may have been followed.
- No, yeah, I figured.

18:11.299 --> 18:13.384
I had to make sure I was alone.

18:14.135 --> 18:16.137
Let's get you suited up, my man.
Run through the plan again.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.681
Take off your shirt. Sit.

18:23.645 --> 18:26.689
Okay. Ready. We're good to go.

19:15.697 --> 19:20.952
Look, don't you think you
should fix things with Pacho, Claudito?

19:23.371 --> 19:24.706
He's a boss.

19:25.748 --> 19:27.750
We're in their territory, right?

19:32.714 --> 19:34.048
Yes. Yes.

19:34.174 --> 19:35.967
I'll fix it tonight.

19:36.092 --> 19:37.260
María.

19:38.052 --> 19:39.470
María.

19:42.599 --> 19:46.102
For our children,
and our children's children.

19:47.395 --> 19:48.688
That sounded great, brother.

19:50.190 --> 19:51.900
Let me do it from the top.

19:52.025 --> 19:56.279
No one gives a shit about your speech.
We can hear it after...

19:57.488 --> 19:58.990
- Pacho!
- Chepe!

19:59.115 --> 20:01.201
Come here, you crazy motherfucker.

20:03.620 --> 20:05.038
What's up?

20:05.496 --> 20:07.790
Look at you. How's New York?

20:08.249 --> 20:12.170
Cold. But if you ask nicely,
the girls make up for it.

20:13.171 --> 20:15.506
I brought you something, baby-face.

20:18.134 --> 20:19.802
Lovely. Thanks.

20:22.931 --> 20:25.683
It's been too long
since we were all together.

20:27.810 --> 20:32.023
Tonight is our night,
because we've earned this.

20:32.941 --> 20:36.110
- Gentlemen of Cali, cheers!
- Cheers!

20:36.236 --> 20:39.280
I think there is business
to discuss first, Gilberto.

20:39.405 --> 20:43.117
You're acting like someone
just pissed you off.

20:43.910 --> 20:46.663
Brother, you're richer than the Pope.

20:47.205 --> 20:49.624
- But I work harder than him.
- Cheers, then!

20:50.208 --> 20:51.626
To the Pope!

20:52.543 --> 20:53.586
Cheers.

20:53.711 --> 20:55.296
Welcome, Chepe.

20:59.384 --> 21:04.472
Look, Gilberto...
you know I have a personal issue

21:04.597 --> 21:07.892
with that son of a bitch,
Claudio Salazar from North Valley.

21:09.227 --> 21:12.563
And he's downstairs.
I would like to solve it.

21:15.525 --> 21:17.068
Okay, Pacho.

21:17.193 --> 21:22.740
I understand your need for revenge,
but this isn't the time to get into it.

21:23.324 --> 21:25.201
There's too much at stake.

21:26.494 --> 21:30.790
Well... shall we enjoy
this expensive party or what?

21:30.915 --> 21:34.794
No. Instead, let's listen
to Gilberto's speech again.

21:35.545 --> 21:37.171
Chepe, you motherfucker.

21:57.692 --> 21:59.777
Look, that's Menga's chief of police.

22:01.029 --> 22:03.698
I pay him money every month.

22:04.532 --> 22:06.868
I pay all these people.

22:06.993 --> 22:11.247
Well done, big shot.
It's not your money.

22:11.372 --> 22:13.166
But I'm the one who controls it.

22:13.291 --> 22:15.752
- Who bought you these earrings?
- Guillermo. Enough.

22:15.877 --> 22:17.962
Sure. You're turning into Al Capone.

22:22.425 --> 22:24.260
Watch it.

22:39.442 --> 22:41.277
- How are you, sir?
- Pallomari.

22:41.402 --> 22:43.321
- Enjoying the party?
- Yes.

22:45.656 --> 22:46.657
Yes.

22:47.909 --> 22:49.243
Nice to see you.

22:50.244 --> 22:52.246
Don Gilberto, good evening.

22:52.372 --> 22:54.957
- Welcome, Mr. Mayor.
- Don Gilberto, how are you?

22:57.293 --> 22:58.920
Good evening, Don Gilberto.

23:05.134 --> 23:07.595
- Look, here it is.
- Motherfucker.

23:20.983 --> 23:21.776
Hello.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.820
- Good evening.
- Can I have aguardiente with ice?

23:23.945 --> 23:26.072
- Of course.
- Thank you.

23:46.008 --> 23:47.009
Are you...

23:48.719 --> 23:50.304
...enjoying yourself?

23:50.430 --> 23:52.932
Yes. Very much, thank you.

24:00.148 --> 24:02.191
Miguel Rodríguez, nice to meet you.

24:02.316 --> 24:03.693
María Salazar.

24:04.444 --> 24:06.279
Thank you for having us.

24:27.758 --> 24:28.968
Good evening.

24:29.093 --> 24:30.803
Mister Rodríguez would like
for his associates

24:30.928 --> 24:32.930
to join him in the equestrian ring
for an announcement.

24:33.055 --> 24:34.849
Please, go right ahead.

24:35.850 --> 24:38.853
Gentlemen, please follow the ushers
towards the stables.

24:39.437 --> 24:40.771
Thank you.

24:45.526 --> 24:46.777
Stop there.

24:48.112 --> 24:50.072
You must be using
some high-end equipment

24:50.198 --> 24:52.325
if you're getting anything
in this shitty light.

24:53.576 --> 24:54.952
Who are you?

24:55.077 --> 24:57.538
I'm in charge of security
for the Rodríguez brothers.

24:57.663 --> 25:01.459
See that man over there?
His name is Navegante.

25:02.335 --> 25:04.629
Guess what he does?

25:06.130 --> 25:10.051
Either you come with me,
or you go with him. You understand?

25:12.178 --> 25:13.846
Follow me.

25:30.780 --> 25:32.949
Your name is Andrés Restrepo.

25:33.074 --> 25:35.034
You live with your mother
in commune number 3.

25:36.285 --> 25:38.621
You have a girlfriend in Libertadores.

25:40.540 --> 25:42.333
Your brother is Lucho.

25:42.458 --> 25:45.294
He's in federal custody
in the United States.

25:45.878 --> 25:48.214
That's why you agreed
to work for the DEA.

25:48.339 --> 25:49.966
Don't lie to me.

25:50.800 --> 25:52.969
Andrés, you made a bad decision.

25:53.094 --> 25:56.514
But I think you're smart enough
to realise that.

25:57.306 --> 26:01.060
You have another decision to make,
and it's the only way to get out alive.

26:01.686 --> 26:03.271
Leave Cali.

26:04.397 --> 26:08.067
Don't say goodbye to your mother
or to your girlfriend.

26:08.568 --> 26:11.153
I need you to disappear.

26:14.699 --> 26:17.994
Associates, friends.

26:19.161 --> 26:20.955
Our enemy is dead!

26:22.999 --> 26:25.626
Our business is strong!

26:26.502 --> 26:28.838
Together we have taken this business

26:28.963 --> 26:32.466
to heights that our predecessors
couldn't have imagined.

26:32.592 --> 26:39.265
But friends... there's circumstances
that we need to acknowledge.

26:45.896 --> 26:48.608
- Stoddard!
- 'Listen to me.

26:49.108 --> 26:55.781
'The law enforcement spotlight will shine
brightly on us, as it once did on Escobar.

26:57.033 --> 26:59.994
'And so, while we celebrate,

27:00.119 --> 27:04.957
'they will do everything they can
to take away everything we've built.

27:07.585 --> 27:13.174
An American named Joseph Kennedy
made his fortune selling bootlegged liquor,

27:13.758 --> 27:15.968
but he turned that money into legitimacy.

27:16.093 --> 27:18.220
His children, great politicians.

27:18.346 --> 27:21.932
And one of them was
even elected president.

27:22.683 --> 27:27.396
Yes, gentlemen, we have been
negotiating with the authorities,

27:27.521 --> 27:29.273
and soon we will reach an agreement.

27:34.820 --> 27:40.493
Our organisation, within six months,
will be out of the cocaine business.

27:42.203 --> 27:44.747
We will surrender our labs,

27:45.331 --> 27:47.124
our safe houses,

27:47.583 --> 27:49.710
and our trafficking routes.

27:49.835 --> 27:56.175
But gentlemen, don't make the mistake
of thinking it won't be on our terms.

27:56.759 --> 27:59.970
Any prison sentences will be minimal.

28:00.096 --> 28:02.306
Our money will remain ours.

28:02.890 --> 28:05.810
Our legitimate businesses
will continue to grow.

28:06.644 --> 28:10.481
We have six months to make
as much money as possible!

28:11.357 --> 28:14.151
And gentlemen,
as a token of our friendship,

28:14.276 --> 28:19.532
we'll give each of you a juicy share

28:19.657 --> 28:22.660
of the final profits from this year.

28:28.749 --> 28:32.920
To the bright future we'll all soon enjoy.

28:33.045 --> 28:37.049
For our children...
and our children's children!

28:40.010 --> 28:41.554
- Cheers...
- Cheers!

28:42.221 --> 28:44.390
- Cheers, gentlemen!
- Cheers!

28:44.515 --> 28:47.643
- What did you think?
- I think it's a great move.

28:50.521 --> 28:52.189
- Congratulations!
- For the future!

28:55.776 --> 28:58.195
Thank you, brother.
Thank you for coming.

29:16.422 --> 29:17.882
What would you like?

29:18.007 --> 29:19.300
Whiskey. Dry.

29:24.597 --> 29:25.723
Hey, sir!

29:28.058 --> 29:29.977
We were wondering
if we could get you a drink.

29:30.102 --> 29:32.188
I'm good. Thanks.

29:35.065 --> 29:36.066
Okay.

29:40.237 --> 29:41.447
Six months.

29:42.323 --> 29:44.241
I'm going to bleed New York dry.

29:45.034 --> 29:48.704
Come up behind the Statue of Liberty
and fuck her right up her ass.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.128
And then what?

29:58.005 --> 30:01.175
We only have six months
of doing whatever the fuck we want?

30:10.100 --> 30:11.060
Hello.

30:16.023 --> 30:17.650
I love you, brother.

30:20.486 --> 30:22.696
I'll see you on the dance floor.

30:42.424 --> 30:44.760
- Can you get in the car, please?
- Why do you want to leave so early?

30:44.885 --> 30:46.220
Because it's time, okay?

30:46.345 --> 30:50.266
- Why are you treating me like this?
- That's enough! Get in the car.

31:17.167 --> 31:19.795
How was everything tonight, Jorge?

31:19.920 --> 31:21.171
Very good, sir.

31:24.800 --> 31:26.844
Do you think we surprised them?

31:26.969 --> 31:30.264
Yes. I think you surprised
many people.

31:33.100 --> 31:36.729
I'm told we had an uninvited guest.
What happened there?

31:40.232 --> 31:42.151
Don't be modest.

31:42.943 --> 31:44.570
Córdova told me.

31:45.404 --> 31:47.072
It's your talent.

31:47.823 --> 31:50.743
Spotting the threat,
knowing when they're going to fuck us.

31:52.578 --> 31:54.121
It's priceless.

31:58.542 --> 32:00.544
I'm told you want to leave.

32:03.547 --> 32:07.635
I'm grateful to you
and your family, but...

32:08.552 --> 32:12.348
I'm starting my own security firm.

32:13.891 --> 32:18.354
I only wanted to stay until...
Escobar stopped being a threat.

32:19.813 --> 32:22.942
And we are very grateful. Honestly.

32:24.109 --> 32:26.528
You have done great things for us
over the years.

32:26.987 --> 32:29.490
For my family. For me.

32:31.951 --> 32:34.453
I cannot accept your resignation, Jorge.

32:44.546 --> 32:48.884
With all due respect,
I've already made arrangements...

32:49.009 --> 32:50.511
Arrangements can change.

32:51.804 --> 32:56.392
Look, we didn't get where we are
by allowing good people to leave.

32:58.227 --> 33:01.230
We will need you more than ever
in the months ahead.

33:02.773 --> 33:04.817
It's only six months.

33:07.820 --> 33:09.405
Can I count on you, Jorge?

33:11.907 --> 33:13.158
Yes?

33:16.829 --> 33:18.205
Of course, boss.

33:19.415 --> 33:20.666
Miguel.

33:41.437 --> 33:43.230
Pretty girl.

33:44.356 --> 33:47.401
Displays some shaky judgment
in men, though.

33:51.238 --> 33:52.990
Welcome back, Agent Peña.

33:54.199 --> 33:55.367
<i>Mazel tov</i> on the promotion.

33:55.492 --> 34:00.205
That extra, what, 9K a year
is really gonna come in handy.

34:00.330 --> 34:02.041
The same.

34:02.708 --> 34:03.751
So?

34:03.876 --> 34:05.878
You signed off on me
coming back to Bogotá.

34:06.003 --> 34:10.174
Did indeed.
Because you know how things work.

34:10.299 --> 34:12.259
What the fuck is that supposed
to mean?

34:15.262 --> 34:18.432
To the folks back in D.C.,
Escobar was a win.

34:18.557 --> 34:19.641
Thanks.

34:20.392 --> 34:24.480
But down here...
we know what it cost, don't we?

34:25.731 --> 34:28.317
Medellín was a failure.
Thousands of Colombians dead.

34:28.442 --> 34:31.236
And coke still flooding
American streets by the ton.

34:31.361 --> 34:35.115
Oh, come on. You don't care about
American streets or dead Colombians.

34:40.245 --> 34:43.207
What was accomplished, Agent Peña?

34:46.502 --> 34:48.045
We do Cali differently.

34:48.921 --> 34:51.548
No swallowing the spider
to catch the fly this time.

34:52.382 --> 34:54.384
America's got plans for Colombia.

34:55.594 --> 34:57.846
Another bloodbath complicates them.

35:02.226 --> 35:03.268
So...

35:05.062 --> 35:06.396
what's the play?

35:08.148 --> 35:11.318
Surrender.
Cali cartel throws in the towel.

35:11.443 --> 35:14.738
Hands over the keys to the biggest
criminal enterprise in history.

35:16.323 --> 35:18.534
As far as I'm concerned,
the DEA can even take the credit.

35:18.659 --> 35:20.327
And these fucking guys walk?

35:21.286 --> 35:26.625
Negotiations are on the two-yard line,
but it has backing from Washington.

35:30.254 --> 35:32.381
So what the fuck do you need me for?

35:32.506 --> 35:35.551
Well, you're the dashing DEA agent
that took down Escobar.

35:36.927 --> 35:38.971
Always helps to have a hero on board.

35:40.597 --> 35:42.766
Don't worry. Cali will serve some time.

35:43.892 --> 35:45.394
Technically speaking.

35:47.437 --> 35:49.606
And that's enough for you?

35:49.731 --> 35:54.862
If there were any justice in this world,
Javier, you'd be in jail.

36:00.576 --> 36:03.787
I know your guys are running
an operation on Cali tonight.

36:04.872 --> 36:06.623
Please.

36:07.666 --> 36:12.004
I can tell you this:
it'll come up double zeros.

36:14.631 --> 36:17.092
These guys don't make mistakes.

36:17.217 --> 36:20.596
You try to go after the Cali bosses,
all you'll get are more bodies.

36:43.827 --> 36:45.579
I don't know, man.

36:45.704 --> 36:47.748
I met him at an embassy thing
about a year ago.

36:47.873 --> 36:48.665
Yeah?

36:48.790 --> 36:50.834
Couldn't drink it or fuck it,
dude wasn't interested.

36:53.962 --> 36:56.548
I hear you.
I mean, he's not a bad guy.

36:58.300 --> 37:00.469
He was in my class at the Academy.

37:07.643 --> 37:10.646
Kid's been gone eight hours.
He better have something good.

37:22.866 --> 37:24.326
Fucking retard.

37:33.835 --> 37:35.587
Something's up.

38:40.610 --> 38:43.572
Maybe he got made.
Or just spooked.

38:43.697 --> 38:45.198
Either way, we stay here tonight.

38:46.074 --> 38:47.951
- Head out when it's light.
- Yeah.

39:00.505 --> 39:01.840
Does Andrés have this number?

39:03.717 --> 39:05.594
We don't know the phone number.
How could he?

39:10.182 --> 39:11.224
Answer it.

39:14.436 --> 39:18.982
Hello? Hello?
Who is this?

39:19.691 --> 39:22.569
Hang up!
And get away from the fucking window!

39:26.156 --> 39:27.657
They're fucking watching us.

39:29.409 --> 39:32.704
'Turns out that break from
Cornerstone wasn't much of a break.

39:32.829 --> 39:35.832
'Cali spent a billion dollars a year
on payoffs.

39:35.957 --> 39:40.629
'That's "billion", with a B.
Which bought eyes and ears everywhere.

39:41.213 --> 39:43.465
'Anyone visiting Cali was ID'd
and background checked

39:43.590 --> 39:46.385
'before they put their bags down.

39:46.510 --> 39:49.388
'Walk into a police station,
they know about it.

39:49.513 --> 39:51.807
'Get into a taxi, they know.

39:52.849 --> 39:55.143
'Make a phone call, forget it.

39:55.268 --> 39:57.729
'They basically owned
the fucking phone company.

39:57.854 --> 40:00.065
'Operators were told
to pay close attention to calls

40:00.190 --> 40:04.361
'that came from places of interest,
like, say, the U.S. Embassy in Bogotá.

40:05.487 --> 40:08.573
'Get a call from them...'

40:09.616 --> 40:11.243
'...you got flagged.'

40:13.078 --> 40:15.288
- Who am I speaking with?
- 'And from that point on...'

40:16.123 --> 40:17.791
Bye-bye,<i>hermano.</i>

40:18.583 --> 40:19.960
Understand?

40:21.169 --> 40:23.046
'...they were on you.

40:23.171 --> 40:25.298
'It was like the Soviet Union
with nice weather.'

40:25.424 --> 40:28.093
- Fuck!
- 'Even called it the Cali KGB.'

40:28.635 --> 40:31.388
- Juan.
- Here it is, sir.

40:31.513 --> 40:32.931
Thank you.

40:49.531 --> 40:50.949
Don Gilberto.

40:52.451 --> 40:54.119
This just arrived.

41:02.169 --> 41:03.628
Put them on.

41:11.470 --> 41:13.680
'Subject's name: Díaz.

41:13.805 --> 41:18.226
'Recorded at El Nacional Hotel.
Room 117.'

41:19.352 --> 41:22.898
'Retirement works
for these motherfuckers. They're rich.'

41:23.023 --> 41:25.317
I just bought a brand new plane.

41:25.442 --> 41:28.111
So that motherfucker Gilberto
can shove it up his ass.

41:28.695 --> 41:31.948
'Besides, who are they to make a deal
without consulting with us?

41:32.908 --> 41:35.160
'They don't get to surrender
on our behalf.'

41:36.995 --> 41:42.292
That son of a bitch Díaz.
I'm going to send Navegante.

41:42.417 --> 41:46.922
'Subject's name: Santos.
Recorded in zone 4.'

41:47.964 --> 41:53.845
They're going to have to give me more
than that fucking wrapping paper.

41:53.970 --> 41:58.892
Fucking balls on the old goat
to tell me how to run my business.

41:59.476 --> 42:03.772
That's not going to be so easy.
These men are weak.

42:04.898 --> 42:08.693
I'll handle that one myself.
The man is an animal.

42:09.361 --> 42:11.863
'Subject name: Beltre.'

42:12.322 --> 42:16.243
I'm not going to wait for Rasguño
or Henao to snatch the good territories.

42:16.368 --> 42:19.204
Let's organise
so we can put a move together now.

42:19.329 --> 42:23.208
Fuck Joseph Kennedy,
whoever that asshole is.

42:24.584 --> 42:26.002
Córdova...

42:26.962 --> 42:30.465
- El Pecas will handle that one.
- You got it, sir.

42:34.094 --> 42:36.596
'Subject name: Salazar.'

42:37.639 --> 42:40.308
'María, I'll be back soon.
I'm going out with some friends.'

42:40.433 --> 42:43.228
'What do you mean, Claudio?
You're going out now?'

42:44.688 --> 42:47.232
Please don't look at me like that.

42:47.357 --> 42:49.192
It's one o'clock in the morning.

42:49.317 --> 42:51.236
Exactly, María. It's one o'clock.

42:51.361 --> 42:54.197
Keep your voice down
so you don't wake the guests.

42:54.322 --> 42:56.992
Fuck off, Claudio!
Go with your whores!

42:57.117 --> 42:58.660
Don't fuck with me, María,
because I'm tired

42:58.785 --> 43:02.038
from clapping all night
for that motherfucker's bullshit.

43:03.540 --> 43:05.250
'Don't fuck with me.'

43:12.090 --> 43:17.887
Well... that's husband and wife business.
Leave him out.

43:20.056 --> 43:21.349
No, brother.

43:25.061 --> 43:27.105
Salazar shows no respect.

43:30.358 --> 43:32.193
Better safe than sorry.

44:12.233 --> 44:14.694
Honey. What time is it?

44:15.528 --> 44:16.905
It's late.

44:17.864 --> 44:19.866
Go back to sleep.

44:19.991 --> 44:21.493
How was work?

44:22.035 --> 44:23.286
Fine.

44:27.332 --> 44:29.000
I spoke with Miguel.

44:32.837 --> 44:34.172
And?

44:36.299 --> 44:38.593
He asked me not to leave.

44:38.718 --> 44:41.262
Just for a little while.

44:41.388 --> 44:42.847
How long?

44:45.016 --> 44:47.018
I'm asking you how long.

44:47.143 --> 44:49.562
- Six months.
- Six months?

44:51.147 --> 44:53.316
What did you tell him?

44:55.151 --> 44:58.113
What could I tell him? It's six months.

44:59.072 --> 45:01.116
We've talked about this
for a long time.

45:02.033 --> 45:06.329
You're telling me we can't start our new
lives because we have to wait six months?

45:07.205 --> 45:10.959
You know what? I don't think
you really want to leave this job.

45:11.084 --> 45:13.378
- How can you say that?
- You think I'm an idiot?

45:13.503 --> 45:18.133
You like working for them.
It's become your life, Jorge.

45:19.092 --> 45:22.053
You are my life. The girls are my life.

45:22.929 --> 45:25.265
- What do you want me to do?
- Don't say another word.

45:25.390 --> 45:28.059
- It's six months, not six years.
- Not another word.

46:26.534 --> 46:29.996
- She owns a spa.
- Let's go. We should go!

47:11.996 --> 47:13.456
What can I get you?

47:13.581 --> 47:16.543
A bottle of aguardiente,
and play "Dos Gardenias" for me.

47:16.668 --> 47:18.419
Gladly, Don Pacho.

47:19.796 --> 47:21.214
Thank you.

47:33.685 --> 47:35.144
Please, Claudio...

47:37.063 --> 47:40.358
...accept this as a token of respect.

47:40.859 --> 47:43.486
To let bygones be bygones.

47:49.409 --> 47:51.244
You know what, Pacho?

47:52.537 --> 47:57.166
I think our differences
are in the past.

48:02.881 --> 48:06.426
I'll be right back to share it with you.
Excuse me.

48:07.010 --> 48:08.344
Please.

50:27.608 --> 50:31.154
- Claudito.
- And now... the bottle.

50:31.279 --> 50:33.072
Go ahead.

50:35.408 --> 50:36.367
Claudito!

50:37.243 --> 50:39.370
- Pacho, motherfucker!
- Pacho, please.

50:39.495 --> 50:41.456
Don't do this. Don't do this to me.

50:41.998 --> 50:43.332
Please, Pacho.

50:43.875 --> 50:44.792
Pacho.

50:45.918 --> 50:48.963
Pacho, please! Pacho, wait!

50:49.088 --> 50:52.216
Please, let's talk. Pacho!

50:52.341 --> 50:55.386
Motherfucker.
He didn't do anything to you.

50:57.096 --> 50:59.640
Pacho, you motherfucker!

50:59.766 --> 51:02.560
Wait, Pacho! Pacho, son of a bitch!

51:02.685 --> 51:03.728
Pacho!

51:06.230 --> 51:07.106
Please, no!

51:08.066 --> 51:09.984
Son of a bitch!

51:11.360 --> 51:13.112
Pacho, son of a bitch!

51:14.947 --> 51:17.825
No! No, no, no!

51:17.950 --> 51:19.368
Son of a bitch, Pacho!

51:24.373 --> 51:25.583
Motherfucker!

51:26.292 --> 51:27.335
Claudio!

51:38.930 --> 51:42.850
'When Pablo Escobar killed you,
he wanted everyone to know about it.

51:44.185 --> 51:46.187
'But the Gentlemen of Cali...

51:47.814 --> 51:50.274
'...they did that differently, too.

51:53.111 --> 51:57.115
'They wrapped your body with chicken wire
and dumped you in the Cauca River.

51:57.615 --> 52:02.495
'When you bloated and your body expanded,
the wire cut you into little pieces...

52:03.538 --> 52:05.248
'...for fish food.

52:05.373 --> 52:08.668
'Not very gentlemanly,
but it did the trick.

52:11.838 --> 52:14.340
'And that's all they wanted.

52:14.465 --> 52:19.220
'You and whatever your beef
with them was... vanished. Forever.

52:19.804 --> 52:22.265
'No body, no crime.

52:22.974 --> 52:25.184
'No murder statistics.

52:25.977 --> 52:27.645
'No problem.

52:28.563 --> 52:31.107
'I suppose that's for the best.

52:32.233 --> 52:34.443
'It makes it easier to look the other way.

52:35.570 --> 52:37.572
'To let them fucking slide.

52:40.825 --> 52:45.663
'To pretend that these guys weren't just
as evil as the guy that came before them.

52:45.788 --> 52:48.583
'And to a country that had seen
enough of the drug war...

52:49.709 --> 52:52.128
'...maybe that worked for Colombia.

52:53.296 --> 52:56.340
'It certainly worked
for the Cali godfathers.

52:57.842 --> 53:01.220
'Because God forbid anyone thinks
they're the bad guys.'
