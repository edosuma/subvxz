01:20.640 --> 01:22.768
The doctor recommends...

01:22.840 --> 01:27.129
a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.

01:27.200 --> 01:30.283
Who doesn't love a surgery
with “ooph” in it?

01:30.400 --> 01:34.041
Yeah, well, uh...

01:34.120 --> 01:37.010
the, uh, DOC...

01:37.080 --> 01:40.562
has set certain limits on invasive-

01:47.680 --> 01:49.523
It's not gonna happen.

01:53.040 --> 01:55.122
You're- You're not out of options.

01:55.200 --> 01:57.771
- We'll stick with the chemo.
- “We”?

01:57.840 --> 02:00.810
You got cancer in your ovaries too?

02:00.880 --> 02:02.928
I'm your counselor.
I'm here to help you through this.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.526
There is no “through this.”

02:05.600 --> 02:09.366
- I'm gonna die.
- Hey, come on, now.

02:09.479 --> 02:11.164
You could live for years.

02:11.240 --> 02:14.050
- That's a fucking lie.
- Language!

02:14.120 --> 02:15.884
Look, I know this is difficult for you.

02:15.960 --> 02:18.770
My cousin had lung cancer.

02:18.840 --> 02:21.605
It didn't look good for him,
but he stuck with the chemo...

02:21.680 --> 02:24.081
and now he's back
fixing roofs in Oneonta.

02:24.160 --> 02:26.447
Lucky dog, your cousin.

02:26.520 --> 02:28.887
Me? Dead duck.

02:30.560 --> 02:33.086
You have to try to remain positive.

02:33.160 --> 02:35.242
No one knows the future.

02:35.320 --> 02:38.324
Doctors know the future.

02:38.400 --> 02:41.085
They think I need the surgery.

02:43.800 --> 02:45.609
I wish I could help you.

02:45.680 --> 02:47.682
But it's out of your hands.

02:47.760 --> 02:52.004
It's always out of your hands.

02:52.080 --> 02:55.163
You're all the same.

02:55.240 --> 02:57.891
Useless.

03:10.900 --> 03:18.900
<b><font color=#004F8C>Ripped By mstoll</b></font>

03:31.720 --> 03:33.529
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

03:37.320 --> 03:38.924
<i>¿ Si?</i>

03:55.960 --> 03:57.325
Okay.

04:10.560 --> 04:13.040
Suits! On the floor! Down!

04:19.640 --> 04:21.880
Just stay down.

04:24.200 --> 04:26.487
No dye packs.
Don't want no Smurf money.

04:34.600 --> 04:35.806
Fill the bag.

04:53.520 --> 04:54.567
Don't.

05:05.840 --> 05:07.330
Stop.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.967
He got hit?

05:50.040 --> 05:52.281
We could take him to that vet.

06:02.480 --> 06:04.005
Marco.

06:26.480 --> 06:28.244
Marco?

06:36.320 --> 06:39.403
Looking good, Red.
You got a green thumb. Look at this.

06:39.480 --> 06:41.687
It's not rocket science.

06:44.360 --> 06:46.840
What's that?

06:46.920 --> 06:49.730
Oh. I was thinking
I could take a little area...

06:49.800 --> 06:53.282
for my own guys to bust out a little.

06:54.240 --> 06:56.720
- What are you planting?
- Vegetables.

06:56.800 --> 06:59.406
Don't worry.
I'll take care of 'em myself.

06:59.520 --> 07:03.684
Come in in the morning,
sing 'em a little song.

07:03.760 --> 07:04.966
Every morning?

07:05.040 --> 07:07.566
Well, when it gets warmer,
I'll move them outside.

07:07.640 --> 07:09.722
Are you sure it's not too early?

07:09.800 --> 07:13.521
If they grow too big in here,
they might not transplant well.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.490
That's just little bitch vegetables,
like squash.

07:16.560 --> 07:18.528
Broccoli is no pussy.

07:18.600 --> 07:21.080
Don't worry.
I know what I'm talkin' about.

07:21.160 --> 07:24.004
This pot is way too big
for this seedling.

07:24.080 --> 07:26.162
You got to make sure you're
getting proper drainage here.

07:26.240 --> 07:28.049
Don't!

07:29.680 --> 07:31.808
That's Jimmy's pot.

07:31.880 --> 07:34.042
It's a beanstalk.

07:34.120 --> 07:37.090
She thought she was going
to steal a harp from a giant.

07:37.160 --> 07:39.083
It was a whole-

07:41.400 --> 07:43.129
Okay.

07:43.200 --> 07:45.726
If you're worried about the drainage...

07:45.800 --> 07:48.280
maybe you could buy me
some smaller pots.

07:48.360 --> 07:50.931
Yeah. It'll probably do just fine.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.571
Leave your seeds.
I'll get your plants going.

07:53.640 --> 07:57.486
Nah. Truth is,
I like doing it myself.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.801
Therapeutic.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.530
See you tomorrow.

08:03.200 --> 08:04.690
Good job.

08:20.560 --> 08:22.210
I have to say...

08:22.280 --> 08:25.284
there is something gratifying
about this, you know?

08:25.400 --> 08:27.482
Washing someone else's clothes...

08:27.560 --> 08:30.643
being of service
to another human being.

08:30.720 --> 08:34.566
Well, just wait till you come across
some of them period-soaked panties...

08:34.640 --> 08:36.244
or the shit stains on the undies...

08:36.320 --> 08:38.368
and see how gratified you are.

08:40.039 --> 08:41.849
I get what you're saying, Soso.

08:41.919 --> 08:44.605
Taking something dirty,
making it not dirty no more.

08:46.440 --> 08:49.762
And, uh, speaking of washin'...

08:51.240 --> 08:55.529
you see they got a new kind of deodorant
down at commissary?

08:55.600 --> 08:58.331
- Powder-fresh scent.
- ls that right?

08:58.400 --> 09:00.368
Yeah, I'm gonna have
to go check that out.

09:00.440 --> 09:03.728
Guys, antiperspirant
is so bad for you.

09:03.800 --> 09:05.643
You know it's completely toxic.

09:05.720 --> 09:07.848
Our bodies are meant
to breathe free.

09:07.920 --> 09:10.890
“Breathe.” Yeah.

09:10.960 --> 09:13.930
Yeah. You know, that makes me wish
that we had some windows down here...

09:14.000 --> 09:15.889
so we could air out the place,
you know?

09:15.960 --> 09:18.691
Yeah, they're trying to say you stink.

09:18.760 --> 09:21.161
I do?

09:21.240 --> 09:23.481
We know it's hard to get out
of that depression-funk thing...

09:23.560 --> 09:25.244
when you first get here, but-

09:25.320 --> 09:28.130
You reek.

09:29.920 --> 09:31.445
Go take a shower.

09:31.520 --> 09:33.602
All right, Tucky, lay off.

09:35.000 --> 09:39.005
Excuse me?
Leanne, you lay off.

09:39.080 --> 09:41.924
'Cause the Leanne I knew
would have told this dirty hippie...

09:42.000 --> 09:44.162
to go wash her hairy pits and her parts.

09:45.600 --> 09:48.524
But instead, you're off
making new friends now, aren't ya?

09:48.600 --> 09:52.400
Hmm. How's that going?
I can't imagine well.

09:52.480 --> 09:56.007
Because a real friend doesn't have to
dance around a subject...

09:56.080 --> 09:58.970
and a real friend
just tells it like it is.

09:59.040 --> 10:00.804
Watch and learn.

10:00.880 --> 10:04.646
You smell like a fuckin' turtle tank.
Go take a fuckin' shower.

10:08.160 --> 10:10.970
You try washing an 80-year-old woman...

10:11.040 --> 10:14.328
when she's forgotten
to shower for a month.

10:14.400 --> 10:17.324
Strange things grow in the folds.

10:17.400 --> 10:20.802
We hid Jimmy's condition for years.

10:20.880 --> 10:23.963
Spent half our days tracking her down
when she wandered...

10:24.040 --> 10:26.691
trying to get her back
in time for count...

10:26.760 --> 10:29.206
watching her get worse every day.

10:29.280 --> 10:31.044
How is she gonna eat?

10:31.120 --> 10:33.487
How is she gonna
take care of herself?

10:33.560 --> 10:35.483
She'll end up on the street, and then-

10:35.560 --> 10:38.404
- My guess- dead in a week.
- Oh.

10:38.480 --> 10:41.962
Don't get us wrong.
It's disgusting what they done.

10:42.040 --> 10:45.840
And she is-
was a lovely woman.

10:45.920 --> 10:48.844
So, compassionate release
is really just a dump and run.

10:48.960 --> 10:54.251
More like dump and sidle away
like the sneaky, shitty spiders they are.

10:54.320 --> 10:58.166
I know this guy, a reporter.
He might be able to help.

10:58.240 --> 11:03.929
“Demented Granny Set Free”
ain't a sexy headline, and it ain't news.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.322
No one gives a shit
about old ladies.

11:07.400 --> 11:10.370
We remind everyone
that they're gonna die.

11:10.480 --> 11:13.484
I don't feel that way.

11:13.560 --> 11:15.847
I find it comforting
to be around old people.

11:15.920 --> 11:18.446
Glad we could be of service.

11:31.800 --> 11:33.609
My grandmother is dying.

11:33.680 --> 11:35.603
Sorry to hear that.

11:35.680 --> 11:38.251
She taught me how to knit.

11:38.320 --> 11:40.891
I made a blanket
for my stuffed monkey.

11:40.960 --> 11:42.849
Took me six months.

11:42.920 --> 11:46.049
And then my mother sold it
at a yard sale for a quarter.

11:46.120 --> 11:48.248
Your mom sounds like a twat.

11:48.320 --> 11:51.005
She can be.

11:51.080 --> 11:53.651
But not my grandmother, no.

11:53.720 --> 11:58.362
When Granddad died, she taught herself
how to invest in the stock market...

11:58.440 --> 12:01.171
and got really, really good at it.

12:01.280 --> 12:04.409
She bought herself
a house in Wellfleet...

12:04.480 --> 12:08.565
and she started kayaking.

12:08.640 --> 12:12.281
She always used to say to me,
“Go out and eat the world, Piper.

12:12.360 --> 12:14.601
Don't you get stuck at home
with some man.”

12:16.120 --> 12:18.851
I may have taken that
last part too literally.

12:20.320 --> 12:22.004
Chapman.

12:28.040 --> 12:29.883
Let me guess.

12:29.960 --> 12:32.804
“Dear Miss Chapman,
no one gets furlough.

12:32.880 --> 12:36.930
Not you, not anyone,
but especially not you.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.604
Love, the DOC.”

12:38.680 --> 12:40.728
- Am I warm?
- You got your furlough.

12:40.800 --> 12:43.610
- Funny.
- Watch the sarcasm.

12:43.680 --> 12:46.809
I made a few phone calls,
moved the process along.

12:46.880 --> 12:48.928
You get to go and say good-bye
to your nana.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.968
Oh, my God.

12:55.320 --> 12:57.243
Oh, my God.

12:58.320 --> 12:59.765
Are you- Are you serious?

12:59.880 --> 13:01.644
Don't ask questions, Chapman.

13:01.720 --> 13:03.768
Just say “thank you.”

13:05.520 --> 13:07.568
Thank you.

13:08.520 --> 13:10.045
Thank you.

13:14.280 --> 13:16.282
Thank you, Mr. Healy.
Thank you.

13:16.360 --> 13:18.681
Okay. You're welcome.

13:18.760 --> 13:21.604
You're welcome, Chapman.
You're welcome.

13:22.880 --> 13:25.884
Did- Did he say “furlough”?

13:25.960 --> 13:27.610
You're deaf as a post, honey.

13:27.680 --> 13:29.364
No one gets a furlough.

13:31.520 --> 13:33.249
Good morning.

13:33.320 --> 13:35.891
Morning. How are you?

13:37.480 --> 13:39.164
Good morning, sunshine.

13:39.240 --> 13:42.369
- What's this?
- It's a hot chocolate.

13:42.440 --> 13:47.002
A little sweet for my... you.

13:47.080 --> 13:48.684
Thanks, Joel.

13:53.080 --> 13:56.163
- Was it too hot?
- Is there schnapps in this?

13:56.240 --> 13:59.005
Yeah. That one's mine.

13:59.080 --> 14:01.447
Ugh. What's wrong with you?

14:01.520 --> 14:03.761
- Babe, it's for flavor.
- Don't call me babe.

14:03.840 --> 14:06.047
You can't call me babe
if you can't return my texts.

14:06.120 --> 14:08.691
How many times do I have to tell you?
I don't text.

14:08.760 --> 14:11.286
All right? If you want
to talk to me, call.

14:11.360 --> 14:13.601
Or drive over to my house, you know.

14:13.680 --> 14:16.809
But after midnight,
when my roommate's sleeping.

14:16.880 --> 14:20.282
Caputo, look at this. Do you see this?
Do you fucking see this?

14:20.360 --> 14:22.931
Your shoe? I see your shoe.
It's a nice shoe.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.082
- “Nice”?
- High.

14:25.160 --> 14:28.528
These are fucking Louboutins
with gum on the sole.

14:28.600 --> 14:31.080
I stepped in gum
not two feet into the building.

14:31.160 --> 14:33.003
Where are the prisoners getting gum?

14:33.080 --> 14:34.844
Gum is contraband.

14:34.920 --> 14:37.366
Caputo, how the hell is it
getting in, chewed, dropped...

14:37.480 --> 14:41.041
and stuck to the bottom
of my very expensive shoe?

14:41.120 --> 14:43.202
- I don't know.
- And that's what concerns me.

14:43.280 --> 14:45.886
I'm enforcing your shot quota.

14:45.960 --> 14:48.406
I'm doing everything I can.

14:48.480 --> 14:51.404
Well, do better.
Take control.

14:51.480 --> 14:54.245
- You, do you work here?
- Yes, ma'am.

14:54.320 --> 14:56.926
Don't call me “ma'am.” I'm not an old lady
you're bagging groceries for.

14:57.040 --> 14:59.441
You're a correctional officer.

14:59.520 --> 15:01.522
Your job is to enforce the rules.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.523
- Do you know what the rules are?
- Yes.

15:03.600 --> 15:07.491
Because right now, looking in
an arbitrary direction, I see large earrings.

15:07.560 --> 15:11.201
I see unapproved makeup.
Am I the only one who sees this?

15:11.280 --> 15:13.009
Do I have super vision?

15:13.080 --> 15:15.082
Am I like the boy
in <i>The Sixth Sense...</i>

15:15.160 --> 15:17.049
who sees infractions
no one else sees?

15:17.120 --> 15:19.930
Am I in a fucking
M. Night “Shalamalama” movie...

15:20.000 --> 15:22.731
or is that inmate wearing
green eye shadow?

15:22.800 --> 15:25.485
I think its pronounced Shyamalan.

15:27.280 --> 15:30.045
I, uh, better get back to work.

15:31.440 --> 15:33.363
Miss Figueroa,
everyone wears makeup.

15:33.440 --> 15:35.442
Oh, good. I'm not crazy.

15:35.520 --> 15:39.320
So, are you gonna do something about it,
or are you just here for decoration?

15:39.400 --> 15:41.402
Inmate, hold up.

15:42.960 --> 15:44.610
That was totally unnecessary.

15:44.680 --> 15:47.809
Oh, did I make her sad puppy-dog eyes
look even sadder?

15:47.880 --> 15:50.645
I know you have some kind of pathetic
“Love is...” cartoon crush on her...

15:50.760 --> 15:52.250
but this isn't high school.

15:52.320 --> 15:55.324
Do your job,
or I will find someone who will.

15:57.760 --> 15:59.922
And make this one take a shower.

16:06.440 --> 16:08.044
I'm so fucking tired all the time.

16:08.120 --> 16:10.885
I fall asleep everywhere.
It's like I'm a necrophiliac.

16:13.120 --> 16:15.168
You guys come up
with a plan yet or what?

16:15.240 --> 16:17.925
Last idea was to pretend I'm fat...

16:18.000 --> 16:20.731
have it in the broom closet,
and then sneak it out in his leg.

16:20.800 --> 16:22.404
But I'm pretty sure he was kidding.

16:22.480 --> 16:24.642
He could be on to something
though, you know?

16:24.720 --> 16:28.008
People around here seem
to have all sorts of ways of getting shit in...

16:28.080 --> 16:30.765
so maybe you could
figure out the reverse.

16:33.800 --> 16:36.371
The top's extra for my kitchen.

16:36.440 --> 16:38.841
The bottom's some perks for my girls.

16:38.920 --> 16:41.651
- Don't want any drama.
- No drama.

16:41.720 --> 16:43.210
Just business.

16:59.360 --> 17:02.364
Hey, lady, are you taking her blood
or giving her a tattoo?

17:02.440 --> 17:05.011
- I'm doing my best.
- Yeah, well, your best sucks.

17:05.079 --> 17:09.722
Maybe you'll start vomiting soon
so you can't talk so much, yes?

17:10.599 --> 17:12.489
Go stick your head in a bucket.

17:15.040 --> 17:18.089
Thank you for defending
my veins, bucket boy.

17:18.160 --> 17:21.130
Yeah, well, she's a useless bitch.

17:21.200 --> 17:22.849
She's a drunk.

17:22.920 --> 17:25.241
- What are you talking about?
- Watch.

17:25.319 --> 17:27.891
She'll drop off the blood
at the window...

17:27.960 --> 17:32.488
circle back to the cabinet,
where they keep their purses.

17:32.560 --> 17:34.801
Then she'll turn her back...

17:34.880 --> 17:38.407
and she'll take a slug of something.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.289
Then close it up...

17:42.360 --> 17:44.886
and pop a piece of gum
into her mouth.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.843
She's like clockwork.

17:46.960 --> 17:50.442
Every 20 minutes or so.

17:50.520 --> 17:52.409
Shit.

17:52.480 --> 17:54.562
You've been casing the joint.

17:54.640 --> 17:57.849
We got time here.
You're not that interesting.

17:57.920 --> 17:59.649
Okay, okay.

17:59.720 --> 18:03.930
So, if you were gonna pull off a heist
in this room right now, how would you do it?

18:04.000 --> 18:06.810
One last heist before I go?

18:06.880 --> 18:09.326
- This isn't the movies, kid.
- No.

18:09.440 --> 18:12.171
Come on, humor me.
I have cancer.

18:13.440 --> 18:15.727
Who's the mark, smart-ass?

18:18.760 --> 18:20.888
Drunky bitch.
Yeah, let's steal her wallet.

18:20.960 --> 18:23.531
Okay, fine. I'll play.

18:25.440 --> 18:29.081
We're lucky today.
I got CO Ford.

18:29.160 --> 18:33.609
He actually gets off his ass
to check the driver once an hour.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.364
Takes five minutes.

18:35.440 --> 18:37.841
Then he takes a bathroom break.

18:37.920 --> 18:40.969
- Two minutes.
- Good.

18:41.040 --> 18:45.170
Then he takes a coffee.
That's another four, tops.

18:45.240 --> 18:47.561
And the receptionist is a smoker.

18:47.640 --> 18:51.440
She takes a break
every three hours on the dot.

18:51.520 --> 18:53.090
So, how do I know
which purse is Drunky's?

18:53.160 --> 18:56.050
Feel for the one with the flask.

18:56.120 --> 19:01.047
Smokey's last break
was... an hour-15 ago.

19:02.480 --> 19:04.767
So, what?
Do we just- just wait?

19:04.840 --> 19:06.649
We wait.

19:06.720 --> 19:09.121
It'd be faster if you go down Steinway.

19:09.200 --> 19:11.043
Except there's construction.

19:11.120 --> 19:13.600
Andy, you got to find
a way around it, okay?

19:13.680 --> 19:16.843
- No problem.
- Will you two stop? Hey, this is work.

19:16.920 --> 19:19.161
Work now, ass-play later.
I got it.

19:19.240 --> 19:21.322
Okay, listen.

19:21.400 --> 19:23.164
We're looking at three tellers
and one guard.

19:23.240 --> 19:24.924
I'll cover the guard.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.321
Don, you do the cash, okay?

19:27.400 --> 19:29.926
And we gotta do this before noon...

19:30.000 --> 19:32.606
because it's Friday,
and they add extra people in after lunch.

19:35.160 --> 19:37.162
Can you handle the guard?

19:40.960 --> 19:42.962
This fucking guy.

19:44.280 --> 19:47.921
Could I handle the guard in Bayside?

19:48.040 --> 19:51.522
The two in First National?

19:51.600 --> 19:54.763
Wasn't me who freaked out
at Commerce Bank, was it, Don?

19:56.440 --> 19:58.681
Okay.

19:58.800 --> 20:01.326
- We ready to roll?
- I'm off.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.880
Hold up.
One more thing.

20:10.360 --> 20:11.964
Ah, you gotta do this every time?

20:14.280 --> 20:15.770
It's good luck.

20:15.840 --> 20:19.003
Pull over. Pull over here.
There's the car.

20:25.960 --> 20:27.883
Andy, what are you doing?
We gotta do the switch.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.167
- Let's go.
- I need a minute.

20:30.240 --> 20:32.686
<i>Papi,</i> we don't got minutes.
Come on. There's no time to rest.

20:32.760 --> 20:34.489
Rosa!

20:38.120 --> 20:40.805
- I think he's having a heart attack.
- Let's go.

20:43.080 --> 20:44.764
Please don't do this, <i>papi.</i>
Please, okay?

20:44.840 --> 20:47.366
We got to see Niagara Falls, okay?
We got tickets to Cats.

20:47.440 --> 20:49.124
Please, <i>papi.</i> Please.

20:49.200 --> 20:50.725
<i>Dios mío, papi.</i>

20:54.720 --> 20:58.486
Oh, my God.
This can't be happening again.

20:58.560 --> 21:00.483
Not again.

21:00.560 --> 21:03.166
<i>Papi,</i> please.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.209
<i>Hello. You've reached Carol Chapman.</i>

21:18.280 --> 21:22.490
<i>Please leave your name, number
and an ever-so-brief message...</i>

21:22.560 --> 21:25.723
<i>- and I'll return your call at my earliest-</i>
- My God. Where are they?

21:25.800 --> 21:28.201
One call per inmate.
There's a line.

21:28.280 --> 21:31.045
- That wasn't even a call.
- You hung up. Get back in line.

21:31.120 --> 21:33.361
I need to make arrangements
for my furlough.

21:37.720 --> 21:39.245
Fine.

21:39.360 --> 21:43.126
Sure, it's dry for a Veltliner.
Grüner Veltliner is a sweet wine.

21:43.200 --> 21:46.010
I told you he doesn't like sweet wines.

21:46.080 --> 21:48.651
That's why you didn't get the contract.

21:48.720 --> 21:50.848
Meanwhile, she's dictating a novel.

21:52.400 --> 21:54.004
You, Chapman.

21:56.240 --> 21:58.811
- That lip gloss?
- No. No, no. Nope.

21:58.920 --> 22:00.570
These are just my lips.

22:00.640 --> 22:03.211
- What about the eyelashes?
- I was born with them.

22:03.280 --> 22:04.805
Fine.

22:07.120 --> 22:09.487
You wouldn't have let me down.

22:09.560 --> 22:11.210
Shit.

22:11.280 --> 22:13.487
It's supposed to light on fire.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.841
That's the dumbest fucking thing
I've ever seen.

22:15.920 --> 22:20.482
Hey, am I wrong to assume that you and
Fischer have been riding the hobbyhorse?

22:20.560 --> 22:24.281
I don't kiss and tell,
but, uh, I fucked her.

22:24.360 --> 22:25.805
No, you didn't.

22:25.880 --> 22:27.644
I grabbed her boobs.

22:27.720 --> 22:30.087
- No, you didn't.
- No, I did.

22:30.200 --> 22:32.726
Really? Hmm.

22:32.800 --> 22:35.041
That's farther than I got.

22:35.120 --> 22:36.849
- Jealous?
- Nah.

22:36.920 --> 22:40.925
Not at all. Now I know
she has horrible taste.

22:42.320 --> 22:43.845
- Hey.
- Whoa.

22:43.920 --> 22:45.922
Mm-hmm. Told you.

22:47.800 --> 22:50.963
- How does that even work?
- God, you're head of electrical.

22:51.040 --> 22:53.725
Yeah, I know, but how's that work?

22:53.800 --> 22:56.201
- Luschek.
- Inmate.

22:56.280 --> 22:58.647
There better be a dozen batteries there.

22:58.720 --> 23:00.210
Count them again.

23:00.280 --> 23:03.124
Uh, one, two, three.

23:03.200 --> 23:07.171
Fuck, man. What-
What comes after three? I forgot.

23:07.280 --> 23:08.884
You haven't been smoking
out here, have you?

23:08.960 --> 23:10.769
Why do you assume I'm a smoker?

23:10.840 --> 23:13.366
'Cause you grew up in Oswego.

23:13.440 --> 23:15.010
Well, I quit.

23:15.120 --> 23:17.122
More, uh, money for whiskey.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.721
I smell smoke.

23:25.240 --> 23:27.686
Is that mascara?
Why do you have mascara?

23:27.800 --> 23:29.802
'Cause they sell it at commissary.

23:33.400 --> 23:36.131
- Keep your people in line.
- All right.

23:37.840 --> 23:39.842
Now, what are those tits like?

23:41.560 --> 23:45.246
That article keeps on cutting off my comic.
Now they got no feet.

23:45.360 --> 23:49.081
Oh, she's wearing heels.
Now I get who the pig is.

23:49.160 --> 23:52.050
You should have her
holding money bags too.

23:52.120 --> 23:55.488
“Dear Flaca, my bunkie's lifting my shit.

23:55.560 --> 23:57.688
How should I handle the situation?”

23:57.760 --> 24:00.001
- You can't say “shit.”
- Well, can I say “bitch”?

24:00.080 --> 24:01.730
'Cause here's what Flaca's saying.

24:01.800 --> 24:04.167
Try to reason with the bitch
to lay off the sticky fingers...

24:04.240 --> 24:07.289
but if she doesn't listen, drag her
to a place where no one can see...

24:07.360 --> 24:08.850
and bash her head real good.

24:08.920 --> 24:10.809
Shh!

24:10.880 --> 24:13.281
- Jesus saw that.
- You can't write any of that.

24:13.360 --> 24:15.840
You know that the administration
needs to approve all of this.

24:15.920 --> 24:18.924
Why don't you tell her to go buy
a sturdy lock at the commissary?

24:19.000 --> 24:20.764
That's what I'm saying.

24:20.840 --> 24:23.889
Buy a lock, stick it in a sock
and slock the bitch down.

24:23.960 --> 24:26.042
No. We have to finish this up.

24:26.120 --> 24:27.849
This has to be done by tomorrow.

24:27.920 --> 24:30.082
- I thought we had till Tuesday.
- Mm-mmm.

24:30.160 --> 24:33.323
- I won't be here Tuesday.
- Oh, what? You're taking a personal day?

24:33.400 --> 24:35.846
- No. I got furlough.
- For real?

24:35.920 --> 24:38.730
- Wait. No fucking way.
- Yeah.

24:38.800 --> 24:41.041
My grandmother's sick.
I applied, and it went through.

24:41.120 --> 24:43.691
I applied too.
I even had people call the warden.

24:43.760 --> 24:45.364
That shit never works.

24:45.440 --> 24:47.681
I know. I had almost
completely given up.

24:47.760 --> 24:51.048
Now I get to go say good-bye,
tell her how much I love her.

24:51.120 --> 24:53.726
Yo, get that shit out of the way
like in five minutes.

24:53.800 --> 24:55.848
Say what you gotta say,
like, super quick.

24:55.920 --> 24:57.684
Then be like,
“Peace, <i>abuelita.</i>

24:57.760 --> 25:02.084
I'll be in the club with my Long Island
and my fatty, making it clap.”

25:02.160 --> 25:03.969
No way that white ass
is gonna clap.

25:04.040 --> 25:06.008
Hey, hey, hey.

25:06.080 --> 25:07.889
Girls are gonna be pissed at you.

25:07.960 --> 25:11.362
I kind of want to punch you right now.
You better watch your back.

25:11.440 --> 25:13.920
- You got furlough, Chapman?
- I did.

25:14.000 --> 25:17.049
I've been in the Catholic church
a lot of years...

25:17.160 --> 25:20.881
and this is my first
honest-to-goodness miracle.

25:20.960 --> 25:23.645
- Use it well.
- I will.

25:23.720 --> 25:27.691
I'm gonna go and be
with my grandmother...

25:27.760 --> 25:31.446
and ask her all the questions
I never got to ask.

25:35.920 --> 25:37.729
What is that?

25:37.800 --> 25:42.601
Smoothie. Uh, kale and dates
and, um, almond milk.

25:43.720 --> 25:45.688
- You smoke?
- No.

25:45.760 --> 25:48.764
But I chew tobacco sometimes.

25:48.840 --> 25:51.844
Chewing tobacco defeats
the purpose of drinking kale, doesn't it?

25:51.920 --> 25:56.369
Well, I like to think that
they cancel each other out, maybe.

25:56.440 --> 25:59.171
Um, can I- can I help you
with something or-

25:59.240 --> 26:00.730
- Contraband.
- Right.

26:00.800 --> 26:03.041
I feel like I'm playing
Whac-A-Mole here.

26:03.120 --> 26:05.646
I-I beat it down in one place,
and it- it pops up in another.

26:05.720 --> 26:07.768
- Yeah.
- You need to tell me if you see anything.

26:07.840 --> 26:11.003
- Yeah, of course. Yeah.
- Yeah?

26:12.080 --> 26:15.243
Don't you dare try
to protect anyone.

26:15.320 --> 26:18.369
I know it's hard.
I know you make friends in this place.

26:18.440 --> 26:21.683
- No, I-l don't. I don't-
- You do. It happens.

26:21.760 --> 26:24.843
Sometimes you don't even
realize it's happening...

26:24.920 --> 26:28.003
and all of a sudden,
you find yourself trusting somebody.

26:28.080 --> 26:29.809
You're asking somebody advice.

26:29.880 --> 26:32.565
That person is not your friend.

26:32.640 --> 26:34.130
That person-

26:35.360 --> 26:36.725
Wh-What?

26:37.960 --> 26:39.485
Fuck.

26:41.360 --> 26:43.601
The fuck!

26:43.680 --> 26:45.205
Fuck!

26:46.280 --> 26:47.770
Fuck!

26:53.040 --> 26:56.362
Oh, hey. Look at me.
I'm still here.

26:57.480 --> 26:59.721
I'm just doing my job, Morello.

26:59.800 --> 27:02.201
Fischer never came to visit
when she had Rosa.

27:02.280 --> 27:03.850
You know what she'd do?

27:03.920 --> 27:07.811
She'd bring me a Heath bar
and a cold Dr. Pepper at the end of the day.

27:07.880 --> 27:09.848
Isn't that thoughtful? Oh!

27:09.920 --> 27:13.049
Maybe you could do that
when you come to check on me.

27:14.680 --> 27:16.444
I'll see you in an hour, Morello.

27:16.520 --> 27:20.525
Okay. Fine, fine. Maybe you could just bring me
an empty bottle I could pee into.

27:20.600 --> 27:22.250
I can't leave the van, right?

27:22.320 --> 27:26.530
Oh, you can get out and take a squat
in the back and then get back in.

27:26.600 --> 27:28.841
Okay. Great. Thank you.

27:28.920 --> 27:30.843
Thank you so much.

27:39.920 --> 27:43.481
Uh, well, I'm going off
to the bathroom.

27:46.920 --> 27:48.365
Nurse. Nurse?

27:48.440 --> 27:51.046
Can you come over here, please?

27:51.120 --> 27:55.762
- Is everything okay?
- I think my port is leaking.

27:55.840 --> 27:59.003
Uh, no. Looks fine to me.

27:59.080 --> 28:01.924
Oh, what a- what a beautiful ring.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.641
Oh. What is that?
Two carats?

28:05.720 --> 28:08.724
It is. What?
Were you a jewel thief?

28:08.800 --> 28:12.168
Nah, that was never my main gig,
but I like the bling.

28:12.240 --> 28:15.130
- Six grand?
- Warm.

28:15.200 --> 28:18.329
Seven? Eight?

28:18.400 --> 28:21.643
Eight and a half. My fiancé is
a regional manager for Foodtown.

28:21.760 --> 28:23.888
- He had to save up for-
- Good for him.

28:23.960 --> 28:27.442
I'm a little thirsty.
I'll have some water, please.

28:27.520 --> 28:30.171
Oh. Yeah, sure.

28:30.240 --> 28:32.686
It was a false alarm.

28:35.720 --> 28:37.722
What the fuck, kid?

28:52.160 --> 28:57.644
I never thought
I'd get so excited over $63.

29:00.480 --> 29:02.482
- Twenty dollars?
- That's your cut.

29:02.560 --> 29:05.803
- I did all the work.
- I was the brains of the operation.

29:05.880 --> 29:08.486
- Yusef Miremadi?
- She was the brains.

29:10.560 --> 29:12.449
Your mom is here.

29:14.280 --> 29:17.170
- The doctor needs to speak with you.
- Mama's boy.

29:19.520 --> 29:22.524
Uh, I will be back.

29:22.600 --> 29:24.887
Okay, but this is not enough.

29:26.880 --> 29:28.848
It's never enough.

29:31.640 --> 29:34.041
Fifty grand!

29:34.120 --> 29:38.330
- We're not home yet. Cool it.
- Oh, he's so serious.

29:38.400 --> 29:41.722
Come on. We kissed before.
It's time for the after-kiss.

29:41.840 --> 29:43.808
You know I won't do that.

29:43.880 --> 29:46.565
No. It's bad luck.

29:46.680 --> 29:49.047
Cut it out.
We got to drive more.

29:50.640 --> 29:52.210
Pull over right here.

29:55.360 --> 29:57.203
You're all hot from the job?

29:57.280 --> 29:58.930
Fine.

30:04.120 --> 30:05.804
What are you doing?

30:05.880 --> 30:08.326
I don't want to fuck now.
I'm gonna rob that bank.

30:08.400 --> 30:10.801
- We just did one.
- Let's do one more.

30:10.880 --> 30:13.486
We don't know nothing
about that bank, okay?

30:13.560 --> 30:16.086
We don't know who's working,
where the alarms are.

30:16.160 --> 30:18.561
All right, this is crazy.
I'm not doing it.

30:18.640 --> 30:20.688
Then I don't need you.

30:20.760 --> 30:22.728
Yes, you do need me, Rosa.

30:24.160 --> 30:26.811
What are you doing?

30:26.880 --> 30:30.123
Look at you thinking you all hot shit
'cause you got furlough.

30:30.200 --> 30:32.009
I ought to give you a skullet.

30:32.080 --> 30:34.686
- What's a skullet?
- A mullet with the top shaved.

30:34.760 --> 30:36.250
Ooh.

30:36.320 --> 30:40.006
Well, you might as well.
My family is expecting a hardened felon.

30:40.080 --> 30:42.447
It would be nice to meet
their expectations for once.

30:42.520 --> 30:45.285
You got 48 hours
in the free world, kid.

30:45.360 --> 30:47.283
Got big plans?

30:48.520 --> 30:50.727
Be with my family.

30:50.800 --> 30:52.802
Watch my grandmother fade away.

30:52.880 --> 30:55.645
Ah, come on.
That can't be it.

30:55.720 --> 30:58.200
You gonna stay with your husband?

30:58.280 --> 31:00.009
No- Well, he's not my husband.

31:00.080 --> 31:03.368
And I don't even know
if we're friends anymore.

31:03.440 --> 31:06.444
I mean, when I think of my home,
I think of where we live together...

31:06.520 --> 31:10.047
but I don't live there anymore.

31:10.120 --> 31:13.647
I don't even know
if my stuff is still there.

31:13.720 --> 31:16.883
I don't even know if my lotions
are on the sink...

31:16.960 --> 31:19.247
or if he took them all
and he put them in a bag...

31:19.320 --> 31:21.607
and they're all just leaking
all over each other...

31:21.680 --> 31:23.489
or if he just left them there.

31:23.560 --> 31:26.370
Be- God forbid
he should change...

31:26.440 --> 31:30.240
or do or notice anything.

31:34.800 --> 31:38.247
Things are a little complicated
between us right now.

31:38.320 --> 31:40.891
So, how'd you do it, Chapman?

31:41.000 --> 31:43.128
Did you give Healy
a little reach-around?

31:43.200 --> 31:45.089
God, no, no. No!

31:45.160 --> 31:48.403
No. I think that they might have
finally taken pity on me.

31:48.480 --> 31:52.087
I mean, I'm about to lose
somebody that I love.

31:52.160 --> 31:56.210
Maybe- Maybe this prison
has a heart after all.

31:56.280 --> 31:59.170
Bullshit! I applied twice.

31:59.240 --> 32:01.607
When my husband had
open-heart surgery...

32:01.680 --> 32:04.445
and for the birth
of my first grandchild.

32:04.520 --> 32:07.205
They told me to go fuck myself.

32:07.320 --> 32:09.527
Never held the baby...

32:09.600 --> 32:13.082
and I love me
some baby-holding.

32:13.200 --> 32:15.680
I applied too.

32:16.840 --> 32:19.241
- Nothing.
- What for?

32:19.320 --> 32:22.767
My father had a lung transplant
that didn't take.

32:22.840 --> 32:24.968
We hadn't spoken
since I transitioned.

32:25.040 --> 32:27.202
He was a real hard-ass.

32:27.280 --> 32:29.806
But in the end,
he started asking for me.

32:31.400 --> 32:34.244
He even used my new name-

32:34.320 --> 32:36.129
Sophia.

32:36.200 --> 32:39.249
People get soft, you know,
when they dying.

32:40.280 --> 32:43.762
If I could have seen him,
I don't know.

32:43.840 --> 32:46.286
May have felt like closure.

32:46.400 --> 32:49.882
But we don't get a lot of that
in this life, now, do we?

32:51.680 --> 32:53.921
Add it to my list of regrets.

32:57.480 --> 33:00.882
But grandmothers-
they important too.

33:04.720 --> 33:08.202
What are you doing?
What are you looking for?

33:08.280 --> 33:10.044
Use your words.

33:10.120 --> 33:13.124
- Where is it?
- What? The cilantro?

33:13.200 --> 33:15.202
The squash?

33:16.160 --> 33:18.447
Are you gonna smash every pot?

33:18.520 --> 33:23.606
You bet your ass. This is the last time, Red,
you pull one over on me.

33:24.520 --> 33:27.888
All right. Let me help you.

33:27.960 --> 33:29.530
What?

33:29.600 --> 33:31.568
Isn't this what we're doing now?

33:31.640 --> 33:33.768
Isn't this what we're doing?

33:33.840 --> 33:36.207
Here. This is the last one.

33:36.280 --> 33:38.681
You want to do the honors?

33:38.760 --> 33:40.524
No?

33:41.760 --> 33:43.728
Okay then. That's that.

33:45.360 --> 33:47.806
I hope it was therapeutic for you.

33:47.920 --> 33:50.241
I don't mind being criticized.
It's not that.

33:50.320 --> 33:52.641
I just think that if she's
so set on enforcing the rules...

33:52.720 --> 33:55.200
then maybe she shouldn't undermine
my authority in front of the inmates.

33:55.280 --> 33:58.090
Some of us control with muscle.
Some of us control with charm.

33:58.160 --> 34:00.162
You know, you and me, we're charm.

34:00.240 --> 34:01.730
Something funny?

34:01.800 --> 34:04.087
This whole shot quota
is a bad idea.

34:04.160 --> 34:05.730
It's making things
harder for everyone.

34:05.800 --> 34:07.290
And all the friggin' paperwork.

34:07.360 --> 34:11.126
I don't mind the paperwork.
Gives me a chance to get off my feet.

34:11.199 --> 34:14.043
But what if you're tied up doing paperwork
and a fight breaks out...

34:14.120 --> 34:16.487
and it turns into a prison riot
and you could have stopped it...

34:16.560 --> 34:19.563
but you didn't because
you were in your office doing paperwork?

34:19.639 --> 34:21.847
You ever have those dreams
where you save everybody?

34:21.920 --> 34:23.570
Sometimes.

34:23.639 --> 34:26.166
One time, I received
the Congressional Medal of Honor.

34:26.239 --> 34:27.810
Nice.

34:40.199 --> 34:42.043
What?

34:42.120 --> 34:44.009
You got something to say?
Out with it.

34:45.159 --> 34:47.242
We don't think
the shot quota's reasonable.

34:47.320 --> 34:48.844
It doesn't improve conditions.

34:48.920 --> 34:51.206
It creates mistrust between
the inmates and the staff.

34:51.280 --> 34:53.043
You'd like them to trust you more?

34:53.120 --> 34:55.440
I'd like them to think that when
they're disciplined, it's justified.

34:55.520 --> 34:58.091
Otherwise, why follow the rules at all?
The same goes for us.

34:58.200 --> 34:59.884
I don't think it's fair that I was yelled at.

34:59.960 --> 35:02.850
In order for me to run this facility...

35:02.920 --> 35:06.402
I need all of you to comply
with my directives...

35:06.480 --> 35:08.721
whether you find them
reasonable or not.

35:08.800 --> 35:10.802
The rules come from the top down.

35:10.920 --> 35:13.400
But there are rules that
we don't even enforce consistently...

35:13.480 --> 35:15.050
and then we get blamed.

35:15.120 --> 35:19.489
Fischer, this is not the appropriate time
or place to air your complaint.

35:19.560 --> 35:22.928
Well, Mr. Caputo, I'm sorry,
but I have to speak my mind.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.890
You can't just punish someone arbitrarily
to make an example of them.

35:25.960 --> 35:29.567
- You're fired.
- What?

35:37.360 --> 35:40.045
I tried to warn you.

35:41.600 --> 35:44.126
You'll be paid through
the end of the month.

35:58.280 --> 36:01.443
Does anyone else have the burning desire
to speak their mind?

36:01.520 --> 36:03.921
- Mm-mmm.
- Mm-mmm.

36:04.560 --> 36:06.403
Good.

36:07.760 --> 36:10.286
Oh, Blanca, Blanca.
I got that.

36:10.360 --> 36:12.169
I got that.
Go clean the mixer.

36:14.600 --> 36:18.002
Please. That girl's as useless as balls
on a dildo since she came back from Seg.

36:18.080 --> 36:21.289
And she was there what?
Three minutes?

36:22.320 --> 36:25.608
- Can I help you?
- Brought you a gift.

36:28.280 --> 36:30.328
I don't need no more
stale-ass tobacco.

36:30.400 --> 36:32.402
This is to make up for that.

36:32.480 --> 36:37.691
This is fresh, I promise. Put some
peppermint in it, turned it into a menthol.

36:37.760 --> 36:40.161
CO catches you back here,
you gonna get a shot.

36:41.400 --> 36:45.803
So, uh, you and Red
on friendly terms now?

36:45.880 --> 36:48.406
Doesn't concern you.

36:48.480 --> 36:51.131
Damn, that woman knows how to-
how to run a game on people.

36:51.200 --> 36:52.884
I could tell you some stories.

36:52.960 --> 36:55.804
Have you ever heard of the fable
of the- the scorpion and the frog?

36:55.880 --> 36:57.689
What? I'm the fuckin' frog?

36:57.760 --> 37:00.843
You two in cahoots?
I know she's doing business.

37:00.920 --> 37:04.811
Let me guess. You've got a vendor connection,
and she's handling your sales.

37:04.880 --> 37:08.885
I'm just here to cook. Whatever Red's
got going got nothing to do with me.

37:08.960 --> 37:10.689
You want a partner?

37:10.760 --> 37:12.728
I promise, I'm a much better bet...

37:12.800 --> 37:15.929
because all Red wants is
to get her kitchen back.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.401
You listen to me.

37:18.480 --> 37:21.882
Whatever you think you know,
you don't.

37:21.960 --> 37:24.964
I'm keeping my hands clean,
my shit polished.

37:25.040 --> 37:29.170
I got no connections with vendors
or illegal swag coming through.

37:29.240 --> 37:32.767
And I don't trust any of you crazy bitches.

37:32.840 --> 37:35.525
You're both fuckin' scorpions.

38:06.760 --> 38:08.808
Shit.

38:08.880 --> 38:12.043
Oh, shit, shit, shit. Fuck.

38:12.120 --> 38:14.521
Hey, listen, in-
in the grand scheme of things...

38:14.600 --> 38:17.285
I mean, what's a cigarette, really?
It's a plant and some paper.

38:17.360 --> 38:19.806
When you think about
all the horrible things I could be doing.

38:19.880 --> 38:22.770
Smoke all you want.
I don't care anymore.

38:23.800 --> 38:25.370
I got fired.

38:25.440 --> 38:28.091
Oh. Hey, good for you.

38:28.200 --> 38:32.091
You don't get it. What am I gonna do now?
I'm not good at stuff.

38:32.160 --> 38:34.811
Well, for sure
you weren't great at this.

38:34.880 --> 38:37.281
Uh, but that reflects
highly on you. Trust me.

38:37.360 --> 38:40.807
I had medical and dental.
I was paying off my Kia.

38:40.920 --> 38:43.730
You're a decent human being.

38:43.840 --> 38:45.808
Getting canned from
this soul-sucking pit...

38:45.880 --> 38:48.008
is the best thing
that ever happened to you.

38:48.080 --> 38:50.481
Go home, take a hot bath...

38:50.560 --> 38:54.565
and start looking
into technical colleges or cosmetology.

38:54.640 --> 38:56.847
Learn to wax armpits and vag lips.

38:56.920 --> 38:58.922
There's a million things
out there for you.

39:03.240 --> 39:05.561
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah, shoot.

39:05.640 --> 39:08.484
Like, a while back,
were you hitting on me?

39:09.520 --> 39:11.443
We don't dream, we die, right?

39:13.240 --> 39:16.562
So, how'd I do?

39:16.640 --> 39:20.042
- I thought about it.
- Seriously?

39:20.120 --> 39:22.009
Not in a thousand years.

39:24.440 --> 39:27.364
But thank you.

39:27.440 --> 39:30.808
Susan, pack your shit...

39:30.880 --> 39:33.121
and get the fuck outta here.

39:38.600 --> 39:41.843
- Are you gonna be okay?
- It is what it is.

39:47.640 --> 39:50.120
Babe, you got fired?

39:51.520 --> 39:53.010
Lame.

40:06.120 --> 40:08.327
Let me go see him.

40:08.400 --> 40:10.482
We need to get back.

40:10.560 --> 40:12.767
It's all part of my escape plan.

40:12.840 --> 40:16.162
He's going to distract you
with his tears.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.162
Just give me a second.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.401
It's the fucking curse.

40:32.480 --> 40:34.721
I pull you in.
I don't kiss you.

40:34.800 --> 40:36.882
But still, we did a job.

40:36.960 --> 40:38.564
What are you talking about?

40:38.640 --> 40:41.325
I told you,
all the men in my life die.

40:41.400 --> 40:43.562
I'm not a man in your life, okay?

40:43.640 --> 40:45.449
You said so yourself.
I'm a little shit pot.

40:45.520 --> 40:48.922
You're too fucking young to die!

40:50.560 --> 40:53.450
So I'm not gonna die,
but I'm done with chemo.

40:53.520 --> 40:56.364
I'm in remission.

41:02.160 --> 41:04.481
Listen, Rosa, it's been
a lot of fun hanging out.

41:04.560 --> 41:07.131
It's been a trip.

41:07.200 --> 41:08.725
Congratulations.

41:11.640 --> 41:13.005
Enjoy prison.

41:13.080 --> 41:16.448
Enjoy your life, shit pot.

41:22.040 --> 41:23.485
So?

41:23.560 --> 41:25.289
What should I say?

41:25.360 --> 41:27.727
You was right?
I was wrong?

41:30.720 --> 41:32.768
I should have stuck with the band.

41:32.840 --> 41:35.923
I'm clearly not a solo artist.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.002
But at least you're still alive.

41:38.080 --> 41:41.766
- The curse never got you.
- Well, I never did the after-kiss.

41:41.840 --> 41:44.525
Maybe that's what saved me.

41:44.600 --> 41:46.967
Why did I do that?

41:47.040 --> 41:49.646
You didn't want to fuck me.

41:50.640 --> 41:52.881
Oh, but I did.

41:52.960 --> 41:55.725
Just on a bigger bed of money.

41:57.600 --> 41:59.443
Greedy me.

41:59.520 --> 42:01.887
I miss the smell, Donny.

42:03.120 --> 42:06.283
I love the smell of cash, man.

42:08.000 --> 42:13.643
The excitement,
the performance, the rush.

42:16.800 --> 42:19.007
What am I gonna do
in here for kicks?

42:20.760 --> 42:24.890
Man, Chapman been getting special treatment
since the minute she got here.

42:24.960 --> 42:27.691
It figures she'd be
the first to get furlough.

42:27.760 --> 42:29.649
Man, I fucking blew it.

42:29.720 --> 42:32.041
I had a solid two weeks
out of this joint...

42:32.120 --> 42:35.841
and I wasted half that time
looking for your sorry ass.

42:35.960 --> 42:40.329
Fuck that. You found time to violate your probation
and land your wide butt back up in here.

42:40.400 --> 42:43.085
Bitch, at least you seen daylight
outside this fence.

42:43.160 --> 42:46.403
Shit, man, I tried for six months
to get furlough.

42:46.480 --> 42:50.451
Clearly, a dead black mama ain't no
competition for a sick old white granny.

42:50.520 --> 42:54.730
You and your man aren't even
together no more. What a waste.

42:54.840 --> 42:58.287
If I got out, me and Cesar
would be fucking all damn day.

42:58.360 --> 43:00.727
Diablo and I would go
all day and all night.

43:00.800 --> 43:02.643
Sick <i>abuela.</i>

43:02.720 --> 43:05.166
The fuck you came up
with that one?

43:09.520 --> 43:12.888
Christ, Chapman, everybody
hates your fucking guts.

43:12.960 --> 43:14.883
Yeah. What else is new?

43:16.280 --> 43:18.601
“Jealousy is as fierce as the grave.”

43:18.680 --> 43:21.251
- The Song of Solomon.
- Toni Morrison?

43:21.320 --> 43:23.971
The Bible, sweetie.

43:26.120 --> 43:28.771
Man, people's parents
fucking go.

43:28.840 --> 43:31.605
Got sick people in here
can't get proper treatment.

43:31.680 --> 43:33.682
Chapman ain't got
no strife in her life...

43:33.760 --> 43:36.889
but bitch gets the red carpet
laid out for her.

43:38.040 --> 43:39.929
The new Jim Crow.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.526
Bitch probably got down on her knees.

43:42.640 --> 43:45.211
Took a mouthful
of that pink Healy dick.

43:45.280 --> 43:47.647
Yes, I am white!

43:47.720 --> 43:49.290
We have established that!

43:49.360 --> 43:50.805
And I got furlough too.

43:50.880 --> 43:52.644
I guess white privilege wins again.

43:52.720 --> 43:56.406
And as a speaker
for the entire white race...

43:56.480 --> 44:00.849
I would like to say I am sorry
that you guys got the raw deal.

44:00.920 --> 44:05.926
But I love my fucking grandmother.

44:06.000 --> 44:10.369
And yeah, yeah,
she may be a whitey too...

44:10.440 --> 44:12.807
but she's a fucking person...

44:12.920 --> 44:15.491
and she's sick...

44:15.560 --> 44:17.722
and she needs me.

44:21.720 --> 44:23.802
So shut the fuck up.

44:30.240 --> 44:32.561
Ooh!

44:37.240 --> 44:41.564
It's not my problem. You and Vee got beef,
don't drag me into your shit.

44:41.640 --> 44:44.291
I thought Puerto Ricans
hated black people.

44:44.360 --> 44:46.522
- We don't like Russians neither.
- She's a bully.

44:46.600 --> 44:49.649
You're both fuckin' bullies,
and I don't trust neither one of you.

44:49.720 --> 44:52.246
Now, I said that
I would help you, and I did...

44:52.320 --> 44:54.607
but I am not gonna get
caught up in the middle...

44:54.680 --> 44:57.047
of some whitey versus blackie war.

44:57.120 --> 44:59.964
Y'all got history.
I want nothing to do with that.

45:00.040 --> 45:04.045
- I'll get it out as soon as I can.
- You got <i>tres días.</i>

45:04.120 --> 45:06.851
That's “three days” in English.

45:06.920 --> 45:09.207
<i>Sí, señora.</i>

45:09.280 --> 45:12.807
In the meantime, is that really
the best that you can do?

45:12.880 --> 45:15.963
What?
I saved your ass, bitch.

45:19.320 --> 45:22.767
Here's your shit
all safe and sound.

45:22.840 --> 45:24.922
You want Caputo playing “hot and cold”
in your greenhouse?

45:25.000 --> 45:27.844
'Cause we can go right back
to your little planter system right now.

45:27.920 --> 45:31.322
Okay, okay.
I appreciate the gesture.

45:31.400 --> 45:33.482
Give me a little time
for things to cool down.

45:35.360 --> 45:39.331
I've got your order coming.
Deal's still on.

45:39.400 --> 45:42.483
We're good, you and me, huh?
We're good.

45:45.760 --> 45:50.402
<i>TB testing for high-risk inmates
0730 hours in the infirmary.</i>

45:58.520 --> 46:00.409
Mr. Healy, I can't take my furlough.

46:00.480 --> 46:02.801
I want to give it back.

46:02.880 --> 46:04.962
There are people here
who are way more needy.

46:05.040 --> 46:07.441
There are people here
whose parents are sick- children.

46:07.520 --> 46:09.329
Christ's sake.
What is with you?

46:09.400 --> 46:14.122
Look, I don't even understand
why you did this for me.

46:14.200 --> 46:17.249
You hate me.
Nobody gets this.

46:19.480 --> 46:24.805
Chapman, I spent my morning
telling an old lady...

46:24.880 --> 46:27.360
that she has terminal cancer...

46:27.440 --> 46:31.240
and that the DOC
won't cover her surgery.

46:31.320 --> 46:33.687
And she said I was useless.

46:33.760 --> 46:36.411
And you know what?
She was right.

46:36.520 --> 46:39.808
When I started this job,
I was very idealistic.

46:39.880 --> 46:41.723
I was gonna make a difference.

46:41.800 --> 46:45.043
But I'm a paper-pusher.
I fill out forms.

46:45.120 --> 46:49.489
Most of what I do
is I keep you safe and clean.

46:49.560 --> 46:53.451
And occasionally,
once in a blue moon...

46:53.520 --> 46:58.048
I get an opportunity to give
one of those forms an extra nudge.

47:01.560 --> 47:03.210
Most people would be grateful.

47:03.280 --> 47:04.850
I was.

47:04.920 --> 47:06.604
lam.

47:06.680 --> 47:09.206
Until it turned me into a target.

47:13.680 --> 47:16.047
There's no taking back furlough.

47:16.120 --> 47:20.921
When your ride is ready, you be in that car
on your way to see your sick grandmother.

47:24.080 --> 47:26.401
And girls will talk...

47:26.480 --> 47:28.369
and they'll get jealous...

47:28.440 --> 47:31.569
and, yes, it's possible they may
even try to slock you in your sleep.

47:31.640 --> 47:33.608
But ignore them.

47:33.680 --> 47:36.684
Chapman, people die,
and you don't get that moment back.

47:36.760 --> 47:39.684
So you go and see her,
and you tell her how much you love her...

47:39.760 --> 47:43.207
and you tell her how sorry you are
for letting her down.

47:43.280 --> 47:44.930
You clear your conscience.

47:45.000 --> 47:46.968
This is about saying good-bye.

47:47.040 --> 47:49.042
I'm giving you that.

47:49.120 --> 47:51.009
Take it.

47:53.800 --> 47:55.723
Okay, I will.

47:57.560 --> 48:00.370
That wasn't bad, your counseling.

48:05.640 --> 48:07.563
You did a good job.

48:21.880 --> 48:23.405
Good morning.

48:24.520 --> 48:26.488
I brought you some plants.

48:26.560 --> 48:28.130
They're in smaller pots, you see?

48:28.200 --> 48:32.046
- You gonna grow 'em in here?
- No. These are for you.

48:34.160 --> 48:36.970
Uh, I'm not gonna grow in here.

48:37.040 --> 48:39.691
I don't have the time.

48:39.760 --> 48:42.331
I'll find some other way to relax.

48:46.360 --> 48:48.840
Make sure Red gets those, okay?

48:58.160 --> 49:01.369
If you had one day on the outside,
how would you spend it?

49:01.440 --> 49:05.604
Oh, go to my market,
taste the pirozhkis...

49:05.680 --> 49:08.923
make sure Dmitri hasn't
let it all go to shit.

49:09.000 --> 49:12.322
The what? The piroso- pirosis?

49:12.400 --> 49:14.129
Pirozhkis.

49:14.200 --> 49:17.124
Stuffed buns, like a meat pie.

49:17.200 --> 49:19.123
I was famous for them.

49:19.200 --> 49:21.441
On Sunday, there would be
a line out the door.

49:21.560 --> 49:23.961
It was my favorite day.

49:24.040 --> 49:26.884
I'd imagine the families
laughing, talking-

49:26.960 --> 49:29.008
fighting...

49:29.080 --> 49:32.402
all while enjoying my pirozhkis.

49:37.720 --> 49:39.768
It's in Queens.

49:39.840 --> 49:42.491
A quick ride on the “N” train.

49:42.560 --> 49:44.085
Will you go?

49:45.560 --> 49:49.690
- To your place?
- I wouldn't ask if I wasn't worried.

49:49.760 --> 49:51.649
I need someone to check it out.

49:51.720 --> 49:54.883
Order a sandwich, take a look.

49:54.960 --> 49:56.610
Let me know how it's running.

49:56.720 --> 49:58.290
Can't you ask your sons?

49:58.360 --> 50:01.409
I don't think they're
being honest with me.

50:01.480 --> 50:03.608
I know you have family business.

50:03.680 --> 50:05.921
I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important.

50:06.000 --> 50:10.767
I'm not sure I-
I need to be at the hospital.

50:10.840 --> 50:12.365
Of course.

50:13.320 --> 50:16.005
I don't know if I'll have time.

50:16.080 --> 50:18.970
- I'll go if I can.
- Only if you have time.

50:19.040 --> 50:21.566
How do you say that?
Pirosis?

50:21.640 --> 50:25.486
Pirozhkis.

50:26.800 --> 50:29.121
The best.

50:30.360 --> 50:32.647
Hell, what's with the backup?

50:32.720 --> 50:35.041
Latin girls have a lot of hair.

50:35.120 --> 50:36.884
This is not right.

50:36.960 --> 50:40.328
You cannot force me to shower.
I'm not hurting anybody.

50:40.400 --> 50:42.846
My nose would disagree,
and four complaints have been filed.

50:42.920 --> 50:44.729
It's in the rules-
you shower regularly.

50:44.800 --> 50:47.451
- Who determines what's regular?
- Christ, let's go to “C” block.

50:47.520 --> 50:49.966
No! I refuse!

50:51.960 --> 50:53.849
I'm demonstrating
passive resistance.

50:56.400 --> 50:59.404
We're demonstrating
aggressive aggression!

50:59.480 --> 51:01.801
Let's go, Pocahontas.

51:03.080 --> 51:05.560
- Off with it, Soso!
- No.

51:32.120 --> 51:33.929
You better wash fast, bitch...

51:34.000 --> 51:37.447
because a shit storm coming up
out of there any second now.

51:39.080 --> 51:41.970
Hey, hey, hey! Kojak.

51:42.040 --> 51:45.408
How'd it go yesterday?
Did you see your little friend?

51:45.480 --> 51:48.723
- He's in remission.
- Oh!

51:48.800 --> 51:50.484
That's wonderful, right?

51:50.560 --> 51:52.562
Wonderful for him.

51:52.640 --> 51:56.486
Come on. Soon you'll be getting
your clean bill of health.

51:58.360 --> 52:01.091
No. Soon I'm gonna be dead.

52:04.160 --> 52:06.891
I always pictured myself...

52:06.960 --> 52:11.170
going out in a blaze of glory.

52:11.240 --> 52:14.084
Hail of gunfire...

52:14.160 --> 52:16.561
screech of tires.

52:21.440 --> 52:23.442
But this kind of death-

52:25.800 --> 52:29.441
this slow...

52:29.520 --> 52:34.242
invisible disappearing into nothing?

52:36.600 --> 52:39.251
It's terrifying.

52:45.640 --> 52:48.371
I'm gonna go back to sleep now.

52:49.680 --> 52:52.286
The chemo- it wipes me out.

52:52.360 --> 52:53.885
Yeah.

52:55.040 --> 52:57.725
You do that.

52:57.800 --> 53:00.804
<i>Any available officers
to the admin building...</i>

53:00.880 --> 53:02.723
<i>for prisoner transport.</i>

53:23.440 --> 53:25.283
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Mom.

53:25.360 --> 53:28.682
God, I've been trying to get in touch
with you guys for the past day.

53:28.760 --> 53:31.525
- My furlough went through.
- Piper?

53:31.600 --> 53:34.809
<i>So, I need Daddy's
license plate number or Cal's.</i>

53:34.880 --> 53:37.406
Who's coming?
And, uh, a change of clothes.

53:37.480 --> 53:39.084
- <i>Piper.</i>
- Change of clothes.

53:39.160 --> 53:42.448
Um, tell Larry the blue sweater.
I think it's at Polly's.

53:42.520 --> 53:45.126
Grandmother's gone.

53:45.240 --> 53:47.208
She passed last night.

53:58.040 --> 54:00.008
But I'm getting out.

54:05.560 --> 54:07.722
<i>Honey?</i>

54:07.800 --> 54:09.723
I missed it.

54:15.000 --> 54:16.729
I missed it.

54:20.480 --> 54:22.528
<i>You were there in spirit.</i>

54:28.680 --> 54:30.170
<i>Piper?</i>

54:41.600 --> 54:43.125
Yes, Joe?

54:44.360 --> 54:47.045
I terminated Fischer yesterday.

54:47.120 --> 54:49.646
She needs to get paid
through the end of the month.

54:49.720 --> 54:51.722
That must have been hard for you.

54:51.800 --> 54:55.088
Please don't start.
We're already understaffed.

54:55.160 --> 54:56.650
She had value.

54:56.720 --> 54:59.041
I suppose you must have thought so.

55:00.600 --> 55:03.763
We're not gonna get stuck
with a sexual harassment suit, are we?

55:05.640 --> 55:08.291
Good.
As for the staffing issue...

55:08.360 --> 55:10.362
I understand it's hard
to find quality people.

55:10.440 --> 55:13.205
It takes a certain kind
of je ne sais quoi...

55:13.280 --> 55:14.964
to be effective in this environment.

55:15.080 --> 55:19.961
Je ne sais quoi doesn't
always work for 18 an hour.

55:20.040 --> 55:22.202
I hire the best people I can find.

55:22.280 --> 55:24.203
I know, and you're overwhelmed.

55:24.280 --> 55:27.284
But we need some more muscle in here.
I'm gonna help you out.

55:27.360 --> 55:30.170
I'll do my own hiring, thank you.

55:30.240 --> 55:32.481
It's already been taken care of.
