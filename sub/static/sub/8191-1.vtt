02:40.567 --> 02:47.450
We can't come to the phone right now.
Please leave a message. Thanks.

02:47.658 --> 02:51.703
Mamie, it's Jack.
We're leaving London as planned.

02:51.911 --> 02:55.458
We'll take a cab from the airport.
No need to pick us up.

02:56.751 --> 03:02.298
Eight...
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...

03:02.506 --> 03:07.303
You already own that!
You own everything.

03:08.637 --> 03:15.102
We forgot about Sally's goldfish.
If they're alive, can you feed them?

03:16.270 --> 03:18.397
Mom will make my move.

03:18.606 --> 03:24.236
And if they're not, will you go to
the store and buy similar ones?

03:24.445 --> 03:26.739
See you soon. Bye.

03:28.657 --> 03:30.701
What's happening?

03:30.910 --> 03:36.415
- Yes!
- Oh, no! Another hotel!

03:37.583 --> 03:43.589
- What does he owe you?
- You owe me Â£1,1 OO.

03:43.798 --> 03:45.841
I don't have it. You win!

03:46.050 --> 03:48.427
- This girl is rich!
- Time to go to sleep.

04:00.398 --> 04:03.275
- Good evening, sir.
- Yes?

04:03.484 --> 04:06.153
Will these do?

04:08.489 --> 04:13.369
Yeah, bring them in...
My wife, I guess.

04:35.516 --> 04:42.189
Candles, champagne...
Sorry I didn't think of this.

04:42.398 --> 04:46.527
That's all right.
Only one of us had to.

04:49.238 --> 04:51.741
- Is she asleep?
- Yep.

05:01.751 --> 05:05.296
- What about your speech?
- I'll wing it.

05:05.546 --> 05:09.008
- You're sure?
- Yep.

05:15.222 --> 05:21.812
We've viewed with awe the protean
events occurring in the former USSR.

05:22.021 --> 05:25.775
Enormous changes have resulted
from these events.

05:26.525 --> 05:34.116
We can now only speculate on the
future of Soviet fleet deployment.

05:34.325 --> 05:40.498
Thanks to the Royal Naval Academy
for inviting me to speak here today.

06:45.020 --> 06:48.816
He's impressed, Sally.
It's just he's a professional soldier.

06:49.024 --> 06:53.112
It's his job not to be distracted.
Come on, we gotta go meet Daddy.

06:55.573 --> 06:58.117
I'm impressed.

07:05.583 --> 07:12.923
- Find it on the map?
- Yeah, we turn left... no, right.

07:13.132 --> 07:14.467
- You're sure?
- Turn right, yes.

07:14.675 --> 07:18.179
We're gonna turn right.
I'm following your map.

07:31.817 --> 07:34.945
You mind your bottom, Paddy Boy.
Move sure and fast.

07:35.154 --> 07:38.407
- You told me that, didn't ya?
- I'm telling you again...

07:39.950 --> 07:43.871
This is like nothing
you've done before, little brother.

07:44.830 --> 07:48.125
- Target leaving the Palace now.
- Right.

07:48.334 --> 07:50.961
Stay awake, lads. Here they come.

08:25.162 --> 08:28.749
Is that good? A little more?

08:29.625 --> 08:31.460
There's Daddy!

08:42.346 --> 08:43.681
Go!

08:48.102 --> 08:50.438
Down! Get down!

08:53.023 --> 08:54.775
Move in!

08:54.984 --> 08:56.861
Get down!

09:03.242 --> 09:04.660
Come!

09:06.579 --> 09:08.789
Get down!
Keep her down!

09:18.215 --> 09:20.551
Get out of the car!
Come on!

09:21.218 --> 09:23.429
Get out!

09:23.637 --> 09:26.474
Open the fucking door!

09:26.807 --> 09:28.684
British!

09:28.893 --> 09:30.978
Open it or I'll blow you up.

09:46.285 --> 09:48.496
Come on, let's go!

09:48.704 --> 09:50.331
Go, go, go!

09:57.505 --> 09:59.590
Paddy?

10:08.307 --> 10:10.351
Stop! Army! Drop it!

10:33.833 --> 10:35.251
Help the boy.

10:40.005 --> 10:42.174
No, he's had it.

11:01.569 --> 11:05.448
It's all right, sweetie.
Everything's going to be OK.

11:10.745 --> 11:12.788
- Stand back, ma'am.
- That's my husband.

11:12.997 --> 11:16.167
I'm a doctor. I will treat him.

11:16.917 --> 11:20.629
Jesus, Jack.
What were you thinking of?

11:23.090 --> 11:26.343
I'm going to set you down, OK?

11:27.428 --> 11:30.848
Stay with me, Jack. You hear me?

11:33.142 --> 11:35.186
Jack, stay with me.

11:48.824 --> 11:54.705
The feeling here is outrage at the
terrorist attack on the Royal Family.

11:54.914 --> 12:02.296
While no group has yet claimed credit,
there is speculation of IRA involvement.

12:02.505 --> 12:09.387
Lord Holmes, the Queen Mother's
cousin and Northern Ireland Minister -

12:09.595 --> 12:15.810
- would have died were
it not for the heroism of-

12:16.018 --> 12:21.440
- John Patrick Ryan, an American
tourist who thwarted the terrorist attack.

12:23.275 --> 12:30.533
A professor at the US Naval Academy,
Ryan is a former marine lieutenant.

12:30.741 --> 12:38.708
Wounded in the attack, Ryan is being
treated at an undisclosed hospital.

12:38.916 --> 12:42.002
Debora Weston,
CNN News, London.

13:00.521 --> 13:03.816
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

13:04.024 --> 13:08.112
You're alive. I forgive you.
Otherwise...

13:13.617 --> 13:15.911
Hey, pumpkin.

13:19.999 --> 13:22.043
I love you.

13:24.462 --> 13:26.505
I love you too.

13:34.263 --> 13:37.683
You dignify their cowardice
with your silence.

13:37.892 --> 13:42.646
They left you.
They drove off without you.

13:44.315 --> 13:46.692
I wonder why
you think you owe them.

13:46.901 --> 13:53.866
If my mates drove off and left me in
your hands, I'd not only feel no loyalty -

13:54.075 --> 13:57.078
- I'd make sure to kill them.

13:59.080 --> 14:02.041
Who are they, Sean?

14:03.834 --> 14:05.878
Where are they?

14:08.506 --> 14:13.928
The trip was unscheduled. How'd you
know Lord Holmes would be there?

14:23.896 --> 14:27.191
I can't help you if you won't talk.

14:38.744 --> 14:46.252
I'd tear your heart out and serve it to
you with chips, you Fenian bastard!

14:55.469 --> 14:59.181
Not in all eternity
will Sean chirp a word.

14:59.390 --> 15:03.394
Not while his brother lies on a slab.

15:07.648 --> 15:10.651
What's the matter, Jimmy?
Don't you believe it?

15:10.860 --> 15:15.281
It's the entire thing, I don't believe.
The Royal Family, Kevin...

15:15.489 --> 15:19.452
You know that only turns
people against us.

15:25.124 --> 15:28.044
This was totally unauthorised.

15:28.252 --> 15:32.882
- We all know you were behind it.
- Fuck the bloody IRA!

15:33.090 --> 15:36.343
All these years of war
have got us nowhere.

15:37.303 --> 15:41.682
In its heart England is still a monarchy.
That is where we must strike.

15:41.891 --> 15:45.227
At the royals and the ruling class.

15:48.522 --> 15:52.902
You're either with us or against us,
Jimmy Boy.

15:54.403 --> 15:57.698
Make up your mind!

15:57.907 --> 15:59.617
I'm with you.

16:01.202 --> 16:04.789
Good. That's all I wanted to hear.

16:11.629 --> 16:14.006
I'll leave you to it.

16:15.424 --> 16:21.931
Kevin, Charlie's dropping by tonight
to try and straighten things out.

16:22.139 --> 16:27.812
Be smart. Talk to him.
And hold your temper.

16:29.647 --> 16:32.483
I promise.
Thanks, Jimmy.

17:50.102 --> 17:51.437
Kevin!

18:02.990 --> 18:06.369
Kevin, lad! It's me, Charlie.

18:30.601 --> 18:34.355
That's me holding my temper,
Jimmy Boy.

19:05.594 --> 19:08.556
- Oh, damn. I forgot.
- What?

19:09.932 --> 19:11.934
Where's my bag?

19:12.893 --> 19:18.733
Please don't make me wear a rubber.
The Church says it's a sin, darling.

19:18.941 --> 19:21.360
So is this! Darling!

19:58.355 --> 20:02.318
So, what can you tell me about...
this guy?

20:02.985 --> 20:08.115
Sean? He's a nice boy... Sean Miller.
Shot a parish priest in Derry.

20:08.991 --> 20:12.620
During confession.
He thought the Father was informing.

20:12.828 --> 20:17.249
Excuse me, it's not in Mr. Ryan's
best interests or the prosecution's -

20:17.458 --> 20:21.712
- to discuss matters
not related to the events at hand.

20:22.588 --> 20:28.719
If you confirm that the man in the photo
is the one you disarmed in the square -

20:28.928 --> 20:31.514
- I think we'll be through.

20:31.722 --> 20:34.308
I can.

20:34.517 --> 20:37.311
You have anything to add, Mr. Ryan?

20:37.520 --> 20:41.565
Yes, the man I killed was Miller's...

20:41.774 --> 20:43.109
...brother.
- Brother.

20:43.317 --> 20:50.199
Patrick. Not even 17, "Paddy Boy".
Recruited by Sean into the IRA.

20:50.408 --> 20:53.828
The idea is to preserve the
clarity of your eventual testimony.

20:54.036 --> 20:55.955
I read it in the newspaper.

20:56.163 --> 21:00.418
- Please don't read the newspapers.
- Not even Doonesbury?

21:03.045 --> 21:06.132
Do you have anything to add?

21:07.049 --> 21:08.676
No.

21:33.659 --> 21:37.788
Mr. Ryan, I'm Geoffrey Watkins.
Private Secretary to Lord Holmes.

21:37.997 --> 21:41.876
- Pleasure. My wife Catherine.
- How do you do?

21:42.084 --> 21:47.381
- So, Doctor, is your patient healing?
- We're looking forward to going home.

21:47.590 --> 21:50.760
I can imagine.
May I introduce His Lordship?

21:50.968 --> 21:55.598
- Hello.
- It's my great honour to meet you.

21:55.806 --> 22:00.394
- Thank you.
- I am eternally indebted to you.

22:00.603 --> 22:02.438
Thanks for the kind note.

22:16.827 --> 22:20.915
I'm delighted you're here to share
the good news, Mrs. Ryan.

22:21.123 --> 22:24.710
Her Majesty's decided to invest
your husband K.C.V. O -

22:24.919 --> 22:28.172
- Knight Commander
of the Victorian Order.

22:29.548 --> 22:34.011
My congratulations, sir.
Good luck today.

22:39.016 --> 22:44.105
- "Sir Jack"?
- Lady Catherine.

22:52.613 --> 22:57.493
If I'd had more time to think,
I might have done something else.

22:57.702 --> 23:01.205
- You're saying you didn't have time.
- That's correct.

23:01.414 --> 23:04.542
- So, you didn't...
- Didn't what?

23:04.750 --> 23:10.381
Think so. You didn't think
is the point you're trying to make.

23:10.589 --> 23:15.219
No, instead you raced into
a situation of which -

23:15.428 --> 23:18.514
- by your own admission,
you had no understanding -

23:18.723 --> 23:23.519
- attacked my client, who was, in fact,
another pedestrian hurrying to help...

23:23.728 --> 23:25.604
In a ski mask?

23:25.813 --> 23:28.733
...shot a 2nd man in the chest
this one taking you...

23:28.941 --> 23:30.735
After they shot me!

23:30.943 --> 23:33.446
...three shots point blank to
kill the 2nd victim.

23:33.654 --> 23:37.658
I used that force I deemed necessary.

23:37.867 --> 23:40.411
I should say so.

23:40.619 --> 23:44.081
I doubt whether anyone
in this court would disagree.

23:44.290 --> 23:48.044
- Excuse me, I didn't cause this, sir.
- No further questions.

23:48.627 --> 23:53.591
- He did!
- My Lord, there is one more question.

23:55.217 --> 24:00.931
Are you still, Dr. Ryan,
in the paid service of the CIA?

24:01.140 --> 24:04.226
I should remind you
that you're under oath.

24:07.521 --> 24:10.441
- No.
- I beg your pardon.

24:10.649 --> 24:15.863
- No.
- That's all. Thank you.

24:16.072 --> 24:19.492
The witness may stand down.

24:22.286 --> 24:23.913
Thank you.

24:24.121 --> 24:27.375
Gentlemen, this is
an appropriate moment...

24:27.583 --> 24:32.963
Bloody proud of yourself, aren't you?
Stuck your nose where it didn't belong.

24:33.798 --> 24:36.884
Now you've killed my baby brother.

25:24.640 --> 25:27.017
- Hey, Daddy.
- Hey, pumpkin.

25:37.361 --> 25:41.407
Wow, you guys have really grown!

26:06.390 --> 26:09.810
- How are you feeling?
- Not so good.

26:10.019 --> 26:13.230
- Tired?
- No.

26:13.481 --> 26:16.776
I've no idea what time it is.
Feels like morning.

26:17.568 --> 26:20.237
You're telling me!

26:22.114 --> 26:25.201
- Did I miss something?
- No.

26:26.327 --> 26:28.913
But I did!

26:31.540 --> 26:34.418
I'm pregnant.

26:36.212 --> 26:37.838
Honey!

26:41.967 --> 26:45.888
Can I watch some TV?
I'm not at all tired.

26:48.641 --> 26:50.393
What?

26:52.228 --> 26:56.816
- Plates.
- I don't have any say in this, do I?

26:57.024 --> 26:59.944
This is a family.
Everybody's got a say.

27:00.152 --> 27:04.615
But my say is after the fact.
Or am I wrong?

27:04.824 --> 27:11.414
- No, you're right.
- Michaela despises her little sister.

27:11.622 --> 27:17.253
Ready for this? It could be
even worse... a baby brother.

27:17.461 --> 27:20.423
Oh, no. Boys!

27:23.634 --> 27:26.011
- Jack!
- True. Boys are...

27:26.220 --> 27:30.307
You deny the IRA was
behind the assassination attempt?

27:30.516 --> 27:35.688
When the IRA carry out
any form of campaign, they admit to it.

27:35.896 --> 27:39.775
That's the policy.
They proudly say they did it.

27:39.984 --> 27:45.823
Have the IRA admitted to this?
Common sense, logic, reason...

27:46.032 --> 27:48.075
Can I suggest some names?

27:48.284 --> 27:52.121
You don't think raising money in
America for the IRA will be affected?

28:33.412 --> 28:39.293
- Morning, Mr. Cooley.
- And to you, madam. How's business?

28:39.502 --> 28:44.548
I came upon this first edition
at an estate auction.

28:45.591 --> 28:48.636
Can your man restore it?

28:49.762 --> 28:52.807
- When do you want this by?
- Soon.

28:54.266 --> 28:57.228
It's very pressing.

28:57.436 --> 29:01.440
I'm not sure... The binder
may have some trouble with this.

29:01.649 --> 29:05.569
- Is that so?
- I'll see what I can do.

29:05.778 --> 29:12.034
- He's not a miracle worker, you know.
- Obviously, he's not, Mr. Cooley.

29:14.328 --> 29:16.956
The best you can arrange then.

29:18.624 --> 29:22.294
- Thanks, Mr. Cooley.
- Good day, madam.

29:36.100 --> 29:40.229
Hello, Sean.
Don't mind if I ride with you, do you?

30:27.777 --> 30:35.242
I disapprove of your deeds, Sean, but
I can't bring myself to condemn you.

30:40.790 --> 30:46.587
I can't because I understand
where the hatred comes from.

30:48.923 --> 30:51.384
I more than understand it.

30:52.676 --> 30:58.557
But we're now very near
the darkest hole in Great Britain -

30:58.766 --> 31:01.977
- and you still won't speak to me.

31:29.630 --> 31:33.342
They're raising the bridge.
We'll be here five minutes.

31:33.551 --> 31:34.885
Understood.

31:55.322 --> 31:57.366
Mobile Three, Lymington.

32:12.048 --> 32:13.549
Open the door!

32:14.341 --> 32:18.012
- Open it or I'll kill him.
- What do we do?

32:18.220 --> 32:20.514
- We open the door.
- Open it!

32:20.723 --> 32:23.184
- For Christ's sake...
- But what?

32:23.392 --> 32:27.480
Wait until they kill him,
then open the door?

32:34.487 --> 32:37.114
- Your guns.
- We are unarmed.

32:37.323 --> 32:39.700
Just who the hell are you?

32:39.909 --> 32:41.619
Get them out!

32:46.374 --> 32:48.501
Get your head down.

32:48.709 --> 32:52.380
- Get down on the bloody ground!
- Don't you fucking move!

32:52.588 --> 32:57.134
- You'd think we'd forget about you?
- Unlock the cuffs.

33:01.430 --> 33:05.559
Inspector Robert Highland.
This is a friend of mine.

33:05.768 --> 33:10.564
We meet at last. What's the pay
for selling out your own people?

33:13.150 --> 33:15.820
Get on with it and be on your way.

33:16.028 --> 33:20.449
Very well.
If that's how you feel about it...

34:12.083 --> 34:14.128
Come on, Cath!

34:18.466 --> 34:20.801
- Have I got the tickets or what?
- I don't have them.

34:21.010 --> 34:24.179
- I don't have them!
- They're on the fridge.

34:24.929 --> 34:28.266
- Dad?
- Honey, there's plenty of time.

34:59.090 --> 35:02.468
- Hello, Admiral.
- Morning, Jack.

35:02.676 --> 35:06.097
- You know Marty Cantor.
- How's the shoulder?

35:06.305 --> 35:08.516
Not too bad.

35:11.602 --> 35:16.524
Something's come up.
Can we sit down and have a chat?

35:19.193 --> 35:25.199
He escaped while they were moving
him. We think he's left the country.

35:25.408 --> 35:29.328
Excuse me. Let's deal in what
we know and not what we don't.

35:29.537 --> 35:33.082
We know he's escaped
in Kent near the Channel.

35:33.791 --> 35:37.169
If he's left the country...
Jack, listening?

35:38.796 --> 35:45.720
The chances he'd come here
are so remote I have trouble saying it.

35:46.512 --> 35:51.392
Your first instinct was to come
all the way here and tell me.

35:52.893 --> 35:55.980
Marty, want to excuse us
a few minutes?

36:23.382 --> 36:27.887
I've got a few more weeks
before school starts, but I gotta

36:28.095 --> 36:31.807
dig in and prepare a few lectures.

36:32.016 --> 36:37.146
Wanna come look over what we got?
You might turn up something new.

36:37.355 --> 36:40.691
You're asking me
if I want to come back.

36:42.109 --> 36:43.652
Yep.

36:50.326 --> 36:53.204
- We'll go next week, honey.
- All right.

36:53.412 --> 36:58.125
Sorry, Sean Miller escaped.

37:01.587 --> 37:04.256
What does that mean?

37:05.466 --> 37:09.303
They wanted me to know... thought
I might be concerned. I'm not!

37:09.512 --> 37:12.348
The IRA's not stupid.
They won't follow me over here.

37:12.556 --> 37:15.559
They agree. They're gone. That's it.

37:17.978 --> 37:21.273
They didn't ask you
to come back to CIA?

37:22.483 --> 37:24.944
I said no.

37:25.152 --> 37:26.696
Just like that.

37:29.031 --> 37:31.033
I don't wanna go back, honey.

37:36.455 --> 37:40.918
- I saw them coming and I just...
- I know.

37:41.127 --> 37:45.798
I can't go back to that life again,
you know.

37:51.512 --> 37:54.098
Sally, wait up, honey.

38:15.411 --> 38:19.457
I bet your cell was better than this.
Bloody Ritz in comparison.

38:19.665 --> 38:22.710
At least you had your own toilet.

38:22.918 --> 38:26.589
Cheer up. You've just been
spared from hell on earth.

38:26.797 --> 38:31.469
- A word of gratitude might be in order.
- I don't feel like resting.

38:31.677 --> 38:34.472
Laying about
like a complacent tourist.

38:34.680 --> 38:40.561
To build an army, we've got to train like
soldiers. We can't do that in Ireland.

38:40.770 --> 38:44.732
- Bleedin' waste of time.
- There's laying about and laying low.

38:44.940 --> 38:47.234
- There's a difference.
- Is there?

38:47.443 --> 38:50.529
Lord Holmes
should worry about complacency.

38:50.738 --> 38:54.950
Next time he won't be so lucky.
Post him back to Whitehall in bits -

38:55.159 --> 38:58.162
- if that's what frees Irish prisoners.

38:58.371 --> 39:00.873
That's not what I'm thinking of.

39:01.082 --> 39:07.004
What Ryan has done can't be undone.
Stop thinking about it.

39:09.548 --> 39:10.883
I can't.

39:20.434 --> 39:23.771
How could this have happened?

39:23.979 --> 39:28.984
Highland picked the day, the decoy
routes, his men, and still they knew.

39:29.193 --> 39:33.698
- He had two children, apparently.
- Tragic!

39:33.906 --> 39:41.330
31 people knew your itinerary the day
of your attack and of Miller's transfer -

39:41.539 --> 39:43.749
- five of whom are now dead.

39:43.958 --> 39:47.670
I suggest limiting your appointments.

39:47.878 --> 39:52.758
I will not have my itinerary
dictated to me by terrorists.

39:54.969 --> 39:59.557
The traitor had better
pray to God I never find him.

39:59.765 --> 40:02.935
We know you'll do
your best, Sergeant.

40:24.123 --> 40:29.754
- We don't know if we're coming home.
- We don't know if we're coming home.

40:29.962 --> 40:35.509
- Stand, buckle up, shuffle to the door.
- Stand, buckle up, shuffle to the door.

40:35.718 --> 40:38.220
Jump right out
and shout Marine Corps!

40:38.429 --> 40:43.517
Egesta appealed to Athens
on what basis? On what grounds?

40:44.602 --> 40:48.522
Mr. Viederman...
Bad time for you?

40:48.731 --> 40:54.487
Well... they said they'd be grateful.
Didn't they?

40:59.200 --> 41:02.912
"Fight our battle.
The world will fear and respect you."

41:03.120 --> 41:06.540
- Didn't the world fear Athens already?
- Didn't matter.

41:06.749 --> 41:08.626
- Why not?
- Pride, sir.

41:09.251 --> 41:11.962
That's the real battle they lost.

41:12.171 --> 41:14.465
Attention on deck!

41:14.673 --> 41:16.926
Attention to orders.

41:17.635 --> 41:19.553
I've a presentation to make -

41:19.762 --> 41:25.976
- for service above and beyond the call
of duty of a tourist. Even a marine.

41:26.852 --> 41:33.734
We recognise Professor John Ryan
with the Order of the Purple Target.

41:33.943 --> 41:39.031
And hope that he will duck next time
lest he become part of history -

41:39.240 --> 41:41.742
- rather than a teacher of it.

41:49.417 --> 41:51.627
- How old is he?
- Ten.

41:51.836 --> 41:53.879
- Plate glass window?
- Yes.

41:58.217 --> 42:02.138
- Here we go... Hi, guys!
- Morning, Catherine.

42:06.308 --> 42:11.981
I've got a retina at 1:OO. We might have
to bump it. This could take some time.

42:12.189 --> 42:14.817
- Yep, let's bump it.
- We're all set.

42:15.026 --> 42:18.070
OK, let's do it.

42:18.279 --> 42:23.284
So, you just waded on in
like John Wayne.

42:23.492 --> 42:28.664
Why'd you do it?
What were you thinking, man?

42:29.915 --> 42:36.505
- I don't know. I wasn't thinking.
- That's it? You sound like my students.

42:42.636 --> 42:44.555
It just pissed me off.

42:45.514 --> 42:50.561
I couldn't just watch him shoot
those people in front of me.

42:51.562 --> 42:55.024
It was... rage.

42:57.526 --> 43:04.367
Pure rage...
Just made me mad.

43:05.076 --> 43:08.996
Here's hoping
you never get mad at me, man.

43:27.848 --> 43:29.892
She's late, Sean.

43:50.246 --> 43:56.585
And she was at this dance.
This guy, at the end, he...

43:58.462 --> 44:03.342
- Kind of cute, isn't she?
- Is she?

44:12.810 --> 44:14.603
Bye. See ya.

44:16.897 --> 44:20.192
- Hi, Mommy.
- Sweetie, how are you?

44:21.068 --> 44:23.487
Let's do it.

44:27.283 --> 44:29.326
Damn!

44:44.550 --> 44:46.969
Highway 5O. West.

44:56.270 --> 44:58.773
- Good night, Doc.
- Good night.

46:36.370 --> 46:38.956
- Dr. Ryan...
- He's getting away.

46:46.964 --> 46:50.426
Where's Sean Miller?
Where's Sean Miller?

47:07.818 --> 47:12.198
- Dr. Catherine Ryan, please.
- Dr. Ryan, are you all right?

47:12.406 --> 47:15.159
- How long?
- Dr. Ryan...

47:17.036 --> 47:20.289
Come on! Come on!

47:43.646 --> 47:46.607
- Surgery.
- Yes, this is Dr. Ryan.

47:46.816 --> 47:51.570
- Thomson retinal scan results, please.
- Hold, please.

47:53.781 --> 47:56.826
Come on, get off the phone.

48:07.169 --> 48:09.880
- Look, Mom!
- It's beautiful.

48:10.089 --> 48:13.843
- Are you still holding?
- Yes, I'm still holding.

48:14.051 --> 48:17.221
I'd like to speak with Dr. Sutton.

48:36.198 --> 48:42.163
Operator, I want to cut into
a phone call. The number is 555-3464.

48:42.371 --> 48:46.709
Yeah, it's a mobile phone.
What do you mean I can't?

48:50.254 --> 48:52.673
Faster, damn it.

49:12.443 --> 49:17.907
- Dr. Ryan? The retinal scan is fine.
- That's great. Thank you.

49:24.997 --> 49:26.332
Jesus!

49:35.424 --> 49:37.051
- Hello!
- Cathy...

49:38.010 --> 49:41.889
Something's happened.
Is Sally with you?

49:42.473 --> 49:43.808
- Yeah.
- Hi, Dad!

49:44.016 --> 49:47.186
- Is everything all right?
- Everything's fine.

49:50.064 --> 49:52.817
- There she is!
- Right!

49:55.528 --> 50:00.157
I want you to get off the highway
and go to the nearest police station.

50:00.366 --> 50:03.953
- The police station?
- Just get off the highway right now.

50:08.207 --> 50:11.252
Steady, mate. Steady.

50:12.211 --> 50:15.506
- Where are you now?
- I'm at Rowe Blvd.

50:15.715 --> 50:20.177
There's a state police barracks
on Houston St. Meet you there.

50:20.386 --> 50:23.931
- Is something wrong, Mom?
- No, everything's fine.

50:46.537 --> 50:48.831
They're gone!

51:41.717 --> 51:43.761
Coming in.

52:10.454 --> 52:13.082
- Mr. Ryan?
- Yeah.

52:15.793 --> 52:19.130
Your wife's OK.
She has a concussion.

52:19.338 --> 52:22.466
- She's pregnant.
- The baby's OK. Don't worry.

52:22.675 --> 52:24.427
- What about my daughter?

52:24.635 --> 52:28.723
- Let's sit down for a moment.
- No, talk to me.

52:28.931 --> 52:32.935
It will be a while till we know.
Maybe in the morning.

52:54.540 --> 52:55.875
Where's Sally?

52:58.127 --> 53:03.340
She's in the Recovery Room.
They're watching her.

53:03.549 --> 53:06.594
We'll know in 7 or 8 hours.

53:09.263 --> 53:12.308
They removed her spleen.

53:12.516 --> 53:15.603
She's in pretty bad shape.

53:17.855 --> 53:19.398
I'm sorry.

54:03.192 --> 54:07.863
In a moment, we expect a statement
from Paddy O'Neill of Sinn Fein.

54:08.072 --> 54:11.701
- Jack, here you go.
- O'Neill is in the US for fundraising.

54:11.909 --> 54:13.244
You OK?

54:21.502 --> 54:25.589
Here's Cary Johnson
ready to speak with Paddy O'Neill.

54:25.798 --> 54:32.096
I'm praying for the recovery of
the victims of this senseless attack.

54:33.097 --> 54:39.478
Sinn Fein and most Irish Catholics
are outraged at this heinous crime.

54:41.564 --> 54:45.943
I want to share with Dr. Ryan
our empathy and anguish -

54:46.152 --> 54:49.280
- but I'll wait for
a more appropriate time.

54:49.488 --> 54:55.619
- Can you confirm that the IRA?
- The IRA are not behind this attack.

54:59.165 --> 55:02.251
- No more questions.
- Thank you, Mr. O'Neill.

55:07.131 --> 55:10.968
- She's going to be OK.
- Thank you.

55:13.179 --> 55:16.891
It's all right. She's all right.

55:21.937 --> 55:23.272
Mr. Ryan...

55:25.232 --> 55:29.945
Mr. Ryan, I'd like to share
with you our deep regret about...

55:32.531 --> 55:33.866
Mr. Ryan!

56:15.282 --> 56:19.787
Jack, you're involved!
It's not good process.

56:19.995 --> 56:24.375
You're a crime victim.
That doesn't make for good analysis.

56:24.583 --> 56:27.712
Even if you knew something
about terrorism which you don't!

56:27.920 --> 56:32.758
I have guys on it!
Guys who know all about the IRA...

56:32.967 --> 56:39.306
I'm not standing here hat in hand!
I'm telling you I want back in.

56:39.515 --> 56:41.767
- Jack...
- Sir...

56:41.976 --> 56:46.313
Thank God about Sally.
Alice and I are relieved beyond words.

56:47.898 --> 56:51.193
- You manage any sleep?
- Not much, sir.

56:52.695 --> 56:55.573
I'm interrupting.

56:55.781 --> 57:00.286
You were explaining
how we're better off without Jack...

57:01.495 --> 57:05.249
...or something on those lines.

57:13.758 --> 57:18.054
Marc Spiva, Jack Ryan, Tony Ferro.

57:19.096 --> 57:21.265
- Hi.
- Alex Winter.

57:21.474 --> 57:23.225
Nice to meet you, Alex.

57:23.434 --> 57:25.102
- Well...
- Rose!

57:25.311 --> 57:29.482
- You're looking better than I expected.
- It's an illusion.

57:29.690 --> 57:34.487
It would have to be.
Good to see you, regardless.

57:34.695 --> 57:39.450
We've carved a niche for you.
Here's your night table reading.

57:39.658 --> 57:41.327
Oh, my!

58:26.330 --> 58:31.877
"Father killed by RUC, Belfast, 1979."

58:41.095 --> 58:44.932
Good morning.
Cut the engine, please. Your I. D?

59:11.125 --> 59:15.046
- Did you see the game?
- It was all right.

01:00:02.134 --> 01:00:04.762
- What the hell!
- Nobody move!

01:00:04.970 --> 01:00:07.390
- Keep your hands off him.
- Get 'em up!

01:00:12.186 --> 01:00:14.230
Mornin'.

01:00:14.438 --> 01:00:18.526
Kevin O'Donnell, IRA strategist,
friend of the Millers.

01:00:18.734 --> 01:00:24.990
After Tim Miller was killed in '79,
he looked after Sean and Patrick.

01:00:25.199 --> 01:00:32.123
This photo's recent. I think if we find
O'Donnell, Miller will be at his side.

01:00:32.331 --> 01:00:35.209
- Are you with me, Jack?
- Yeah, just thinking.

01:00:35.418 --> 01:00:38.963
- What about the gun?
- Think it's registered?

01:00:40.256 --> 01:00:43.384
- Son of a bitch!
- What?

01:00:50.099 --> 01:00:55.021
SO-13 gets an anonymous tip
about a bomb factory in a flat.

01:00:55.229 --> 01:01:01.110
They get some IRA bad guys,
but realise the tip was a set-up.

01:01:04.196 --> 01:01:07.700
We got three IRA hitmen
at a farm hit by somebody else.

01:01:07.908 --> 01:01:12.997
That's British soldiers getting
out of hand. They're not above it.

01:01:13.205 --> 01:01:17.710
No, look. We got IRA brigade
commander Jimmy O'Reardon.

01:01:17.918 --> 01:01:22.423
He checks into a cheap hotel
and ends up shot in the head.

01:01:23.257 --> 01:01:27.261
- That's how long after the farmhouse?
- Same day.

01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:31.599
- Same day!
- What are you coming to, Jack?

01:01:35.353 --> 01:01:38.564
Jack! Where are you going?

01:01:38.773 --> 01:01:42.610
I'm going to throw some water
on my face.

01:02:06.384 --> 01:02:07.718
Jack!

01:02:41.794 --> 01:02:43.754
Excuse me.

01:02:44.672 --> 01:02:48.092
- One of us is in the wrong room.
- I'm sorry.

01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:50.928
That's OK.

01:03:18.914 --> 01:03:20.249
Jack!

01:03:21.792 --> 01:03:26.255
When the IRA carry out any form
of campaign, they admit to it.

01:03:27.423 --> 01:03:30.217
Common sense, logic...

01:03:41.687 --> 01:03:44.315
Listen!
Who are we looking for?

01:03:44.523 --> 01:03:50.696
IRA terrorists or some
ultra-violent faction of the IRA?

01:03:53.616 --> 01:04:00.498
Jimmy O'Reardon checked into a hotel
with a woman with long red hair!

01:04:00.706 --> 01:04:06.837
This is who we should be looking for!
We find her... we'll find him.

01:05:01.767 --> 01:05:07.440
I saw his wife and daughter die,
but she and Neddie blew it.

01:05:07.732 --> 01:05:10.359
Ryan's still alive.

01:05:11.736 --> 01:05:15.239
- They're not dead, Sean.
- What?

01:05:15.448 --> 01:05:19.493
They survived it.
I can't say it plainer than that.

01:05:20.911 --> 01:05:24.665
- It doesn't matter. It served its purpose.
- It does matter!

01:05:36.844 --> 01:05:42.058
America holds its breath
whenever a little girl falls down a well.

01:05:42.266 --> 01:05:45.853
You used a sub-machine gun
on one returning from school.

01:05:46.062 --> 01:05:50.900
We've started a war. The Brits
are tearing apart Belfast for the IRA.

01:05:51.108 --> 01:05:56.572
Their American money deny the hits
so loud, the IRA looks only more guilty.

01:05:56.781 --> 01:06:02.119
The war is raging. When it's over,
we'll be the only ones left standing.

01:06:02.787 --> 01:06:08.417
Sean, I let you go for Paddy Boy,
but that's it!

01:06:09.502 --> 01:06:14.090
We've got work to do
and it's not in Maryland.

01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:48.124
Hello.

01:07:20.364 --> 01:07:24.785
- Yeah?
- How's the family, Ryan?

01:07:24.994 --> 01:07:29.665
Nearly lost them, didn't you?
It's easy to get at them.

01:07:31.292 --> 01:07:35.963
You should look after
your family better.

01:07:36.881 --> 01:07:39.342
- Are you there?
- Yeah.

01:07:39.550 --> 01:07:46.349
Your little girl's feeling better, eh?
Lost her spleen. Pity that.

01:07:46.557 --> 01:07:49.685
Makes it tough on her to fight off
infection, eh, Jacky?

01:07:49.894 --> 01:07:53.064
You sick son of a bitch!

01:07:57.651 --> 01:08:03.824
It was him, wasn't it?
He's never going to leave us alone.

01:08:07.411 --> 01:08:14.668
He'll never get close to us again.
That's why he calls. It's all he can do.

01:08:16.545 --> 01:08:23.803
You get him, Jack.
I don't care what you do. Just get him.

01:08:51.247 --> 01:08:54.332
Can I buy you a drink?

01:08:55.584 --> 01:09:00.548
No...
Let me buy you one.

01:09:05.261 --> 01:09:08.346
Barney, two whiskies.

01:09:16.272 --> 01:09:22.361
- The IRA's not responsible for all this.
- You waiting for me to agree?

01:09:22.569 --> 01:09:26.573
- I've said this 'til I'm blue in the face.
- That's the point, isn't it?

01:09:26.782 --> 01:09:33.122
You take credit for one thing, deny it for
another. Nobody believes you anymore.

01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:38.210
I want to know where
Sean Miller and Kevin O'Donnell are.

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:47.511
Let me understand this. You want me
to sell out my fellow Irishman to you.

01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:51.599
Is that why you came here?
You don't know me at all.

01:09:51.807 --> 01:09:53.267
I think I do!

01:09:53.475 --> 01:09:58.022
I don't give a damn what they've done.

01:09:58.230 --> 01:10:03.444
The day I sell out my countrymen is the
day I put a bullet through my own head.

01:10:05.821 --> 01:10:08.616
- That's it, then.
- That's it.

01:10:08.824 --> 01:10:11.869
On second thought
I won't have a drink with you.

01:10:12.078 --> 01:10:14.955
- OK, then I'll go home.
- Have a safe trip.

01:10:15.164 --> 01:10:20.586
I'll call the TV stations. Let them film
my daughter's hospital room.

01:10:21.212 --> 01:10:24.090
Put it on the evening news.

01:10:24.298 --> 01:10:28.469
I don't give a shit whether you did it
or not. Nor will anyone else.

01:10:28.678 --> 01:10:33.724
I'll put such a stranglehold on your gun
money you'll be back to throwing rocks.

01:10:33.933 --> 01:10:39.605
I'll fucking destroy you!
It will be my mission in life!

01:10:44.568 --> 01:10:46.195
Excuse me.

01:10:48.823 --> 01:10:50.741
Lads, did you hear that?

01:11:06.590 --> 01:11:10.761
Stand sideways,
you're less of a target.

01:11:14.473 --> 01:11:15.808
Yes!

01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:19.979
Satellite's coming!

01:11:20.187 --> 01:11:21.897
Celts, let's go!

01:11:29.572 --> 01:11:30.906
Get inside!

01:11:39.081 --> 01:11:45.129
So... SO-13 traced the weapons
in the Lord Holmes incident -

01:11:45.338 --> 01:11:48.466
- to an arms dealer
that supplies Qaddafi.

01:11:48.674 --> 01:11:53.554
When Sean escaped, he was last
seen in the Channel in a gale -

01:11:53.763 --> 01:11:58.100
- which didn't figure until I checked
the freighters out there that day.

01:11:58.309 --> 01:12:04.190
Syrian registry, carrying arms
to client states including Qaddafi.

01:12:04.398 --> 01:12:09.111
- Sean takes a slow boat to Libya.
- Exactly!

01:12:10.154 --> 01:12:13.449
Our satellites
photograph how many camps?

01:12:13.657 --> 01:12:17.370
- 182.
- 182 camps a day in North Africa.

01:12:17.578 --> 01:12:22.708
Libyan bases, PLO, Red Brigade,
Action Directe, German Red Army...

01:12:23.959 --> 01:12:30.841
The day this ship docked, there are
only 9 camps with people arriving.

01:12:31.050 --> 01:12:34.387
This one we know for sure is PLO.
This one Shining Path.

01:12:34.595 --> 01:12:37.890
These seven
we're not so sure about. Why?

01:12:38.099 --> 01:12:39.433
We've got satellites in...

01:12:39.642 --> 01:12:46.482
Because those camps know
exactly when the satellites pass over.

01:12:50.695 --> 01:12:56.200
Unless you retask those satellites
so we can get a real look -

01:12:56.409 --> 01:13:00.913
- we'll never
know which camp they're at.

01:13:01.122 --> 01:13:06.752
Do you know how big a deal
it is to retask those satellites?

01:13:06.961 --> 01:13:09.005
Yeah.

01:13:21.809 --> 01:13:24.895
Bring up Camp 18 again.

01:13:30.443 --> 01:13:33.529
Tighten on the camp here.

01:13:37.241 --> 01:13:42.038
Let's look up in here.
See what we can see.

01:13:51.505 --> 01:13:54.592
Show me this grouping here.

01:14:08.147 --> 01:14:12.526
No, there's nothing.
Go back to the bigger picture.

01:14:12.735 --> 01:14:15.738
Let me see down here.

01:14:19.658 --> 01:14:21.494
What's that?

01:14:21.702 --> 01:14:24.413
Tighten up on that, will you?

01:14:34.256 --> 01:14:37.802
Can you enhance that?
Sharpen it up?

01:14:50.940 --> 01:14:53.192
Tits.

01:15:16.382 --> 01:15:20.094
SAS could take out
this camp in under two minutes.

01:15:20.302 --> 01:15:25.474
Kill everybody there
and be gone before the echo fades.

01:15:25.683 --> 01:15:29.395
Are you sure
it's the same woman?

01:15:34.525 --> 01:15:36.569
Keep at it, then.

01:15:44.118 --> 01:15:45.453
Son of a bitch.

01:16:09.810 --> 01:16:11.270
Hi.

01:16:13.481 --> 01:16:15.566
Read it again, Daddy.

01:16:28.537 --> 01:16:32.625
"The sun did not shine.
It was too wet to play.

01:16:32.833 --> 01:16:37.588
"So we sat in the house
all that cold, cold, wet day."

01:16:47.932 --> 01:16:51.686
"I sat there with Sally,
we sat there, we two.

01:16:51.894 --> 01:16:55.856
"And I said:
How I wish we had something to do!

01:16:56.065 --> 01:16:59.985
"Too wet to go out,
too cold to play ball.

01:17:00.194 --> 01:17:03.322
"So we sat in the house,
we did nothing at all.

01:17:05.157 --> 01:17:09.036
"So all we could do was just
sit, sit, sit, sit.

01:17:10.287 --> 01:17:14.291
"And we did not like it,
not one little bit.

01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:19.630
"And then,
something went boom."

01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:06.260
Paddy O'Neill can sleep at night.
In fact, he probably enjoys the irony.

01:18:06.469 --> 01:18:09.805
She's not Irish. She's English.

01:18:13.934 --> 01:18:19.648
This is the girl you saw in the blink
of an eye in a jeep doing 4Omph?

01:18:19.857 --> 01:18:23.194
- Yeah.
- What am I supposed to do here?

01:18:23.402 --> 01:18:30.326
Tell SO-13 her name. Give them her
picture. Tell them about the rare books.

01:18:30.534 --> 01:18:34.288
- What do you mean "what do you do?"
- What about you, Jack?

01:18:34.497 --> 01:18:37.708
You walk into an IRA bar.

01:18:37.917 --> 01:18:44.131
You approach the IRA's bagman and in
front of his guys, you threaten him?

01:18:44.340 --> 01:18:48.928
You never were a field man.
You are an analyst. Analyse that!

01:18:49.136 --> 01:18:52.556
I'm not after your job, Marty.

01:18:52.765 --> 01:18:56.560
- I'm after Sean Miller.
- Then, think!

01:18:56.769 --> 01:19:03.859
You tell O'Neill you're looking for a girl.
He obliges you with some pictures.

01:19:04.068 --> 01:19:07.571
And you believe him?

01:19:07.780 --> 01:19:11.492
I didn't tell him I was looking for a girl.

01:19:42.189 --> 01:19:45.693
Sergeant... Come and look at this.

01:19:59.457 --> 01:20:03.627
A bit of a bookworm myself.
Not that I look it.

01:20:03.836 --> 01:20:09.133
What's your passion?
Mysteries? Spy novels? Ian Fleming?

01:20:09.342 --> 01:20:14.221
- This is a rare bookshop.
- Rare books? So they are.

01:20:14.430 --> 01:20:17.975
- Will you locate the problem?
- I already have.

01:20:18.184 --> 01:20:22.104
Your wiring dates from
before World War I.

01:20:22.313 --> 01:20:25.399
It's what we call
in the electrical business: "rare".

01:20:25.608 --> 01:20:27.443
- Can you fix it?
- Sure.

01:20:27.651 --> 01:20:29.653
- Fix it!
- Can you afford it?

01:20:29.862 --> 01:20:32.073
Just fix it!

01:20:39.663 --> 01:20:40.998
Hello!

01:20:41.832 --> 01:20:44.418
- He's seen it?
- I don't know.

01:20:46.462 --> 01:20:48.297
He's got it. Look.

01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:52.927
What do you make of this?

01:20:57.181 --> 01:20:58.849
I have no idea!

01:21:00.017 --> 01:21:01.352
Damn!

01:21:04.271 --> 01:21:10.152
I have to go out now for a few minutes
to deliver some books.

01:21:10.361 --> 01:21:16.117
- Please, keep about your repairs.
- I'll be here all week. Don't worry.

01:21:56.991 --> 01:21:58.325
He's mine!

01:22:32.693 --> 01:22:34.028
Damn!

01:22:48.918 --> 01:22:53.172
- The White House dinner's no problem.
- What is the problem?

01:22:53.381 --> 01:22:56.550
No problem.
Just running out of dates.

01:22:56.759 --> 01:23:03.516
We could do that. Move that to there
which would leave us... the 14th?

01:23:04.767 --> 01:23:06.852
- The 14th.
- Geoffrey...

01:23:07.061 --> 01:23:14.110
Let's schedule a presentation dinner at
our embassy in Washington on the... -

01:23:14.318 --> 01:23:17.613
...14th.
- The 14th!

01:23:19.740 --> 01:23:25.913
Let's cover this again so I can get
it clear. We start in Washington...

01:23:29.250 --> 01:23:34.005
- Geoffrey Watkins.
- I'm trying to reach Mr. Titus.

01:23:34.714 --> 01:23:38.551
- Is that Ext. 2691?
- No, it's 2619.

01:23:38.759 --> 01:23:40.594
I'm terribly sorry.

01:23:50.438 --> 01:23:56.193
- Why are you up? Go back to bed.
- I want to be there when she wakes up.

01:23:56.402 --> 01:24:00.239
- I'll go with you, then take a cab back.
- OK.

01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:03.534
- Hello.
- Sir John Ryan, please.

01:24:03.743 --> 01:24:08.622
Just a minute.
It's for you, Sir John.

01:24:13.878 --> 01:24:18.007
Mr. Ryan has a special celebration
that evening.

01:24:18.215 --> 01:24:22.011
- He invited you to join them.
- Where? At his house?

01:24:22.219 --> 01:24:24.221
Yes, sir.

01:24:27.099 --> 01:24:29.143
Why not?

01:24:39.820 --> 01:24:43.657
We shot this eight days ago in Berlin.

01:24:43.866 --> 01:24:49.538
One... Two... Three... Four Brits
travelling with him.

01:24:50.748 --> 01:24:55.670
- Light arms.
- The heavy stuff's in the cars.

01:24:55.878 --> 01:24:58.422
He's German... He's German.

01:24:58.631 --> 01:25:00.633
This boring you, Sean?

01:25:00.841 --> 01:25:06.764
Six altogether. Should be the same
security when Holmes's in Washington.

01:25:06.972 --> 01:25:10.142
You got to find
the moment when he's unprotected.

01:25:10.351 --> 01:25:16.649
Four days, Washington.
One day, New York... shopping.

01:25:30.996 --> 01:25:37.211
Yeah... Two Caucasians.
Take a look at the one with the hat.

01:25:39.547 --> 01:25:45.678
- His arms look a little pink.
- Sunburn. New arrival.

01:26:00.693 --> 01:26:05.031
What do you think?
Same guy?

01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:11.162
That rare book dealer,
Dennis Cooley, is bald.

01:26:13.331 --> 01:26:17.877
It's possible there could be a woman
in some of these camps -

01:26:18.085 --> 01:26:24.884
- but with her and Cooley
in the same place. If that is Cooley...

01:26:25.092 --> 01:26:28.346
The odds of coincidence
are dropping fast.

01:26:30.473 --> 01:26:37.980
Still, there's no way I can be...
absolutely certain.

01:26:38.189 --> 01:26:43.486
Excuse me, Jack. Tell me one thing
in life that is absolutely for certain.

01:26:46.489 --> 01:26:49.450
My daughter's love.

01:26:50.993 --> 01:26:56.165
What I need to hear is your best guess
and I think I've heard it.

01:27:00.336 --> 01:27:01.712
Haven't I?

01:27:12.223 --> 01:27:16.727
The bastards took away my book shop.
And my books!

01:27:16.936 --> 01:27:23.484
I'm sorry, you can't come. You haven't
got the training. This mission is messy.

01:27:23.693 --> 01:27:25.903
I can fire a gun.

01:27:49.719 --> 01:27:52.096
Sorry, Dennis.

01:28:22.877 --> 01:28:27.631
- Where are you taking me, Marty?
- You've taken us, Jack...

01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:32.178
- Satellite now entering target area.
...into battle.

01:28:33.971 --> 01:28:37.058
Enlargement Sector Four.

01:28:44.106 --> 01:28:50.196
Airborne Support approaching target.
E. T.A. 35 seconds.

01:29:23.145 --> 01:29:25.106
SAS team on ground.

01:29:39.578 --> 01:29:43.499
- Enlarge Camp 18.
- Enlarging it.

01:29:43.708 --> 01:29:47.378
- Enlarge primary target.
- Enlarging.

01:29:54.343 --> 01:29:56.595
That is a kill!

01:30:10.067 --> 01:30:13.612
Targets have been neutralised.

01:31:07.792 --> 01:31:11.504
Keyhole is passing out of vision.

01:31:23.683 --> 01:31:25.434
It's over.

01:32:31.917 --> 01:32:35.254
- Roger that.
- Would your men outside like coffee?

01:32:35.463 --> 01:32:37.923
No thank you. They're fine.

01:32:38.132 --> 01:32:42.219
Thank you, Sally, for inviting us
to your homecoming.

01:32:42.428 --> 01:32:47.975
You're a lovely young lady.
My pleasure to finally met you.

01:32:48.184 --> 01:32:50.144
You're welcome.

01:32:51.145 --> 01:32:55.816
- Can I do the presentation after dinner?
- Sure.

01:32:56.025 --> 01:32:59.195
Would you like to see it now?
Geoffrey!

01:33:04.867 --> 01:33:09.789
- That's very nice.
- Didn't I already give you one of those?

01:33:24.136 --> 01:33:28.224
Is that your second piece of cake,
my little sweetie?

01:33:28.432 --> 01:33:32.520
- Where's the bathroom, Jack?
- Second door on the left.

01:33:32.728 --> 01:33:35.231
- More coffee anyone?
- I'd love some.

01:33:36.107 --> 01:33:39.652
- Excuse me.
- Here it comes.

01:33:40.903 --> 01:33:44.615
Bathroom?
Someone in there?

01:33:44.824 --> 01:33:48.119
That's not it.
That's the basement.

01:33:57.044 --> 01:33:59.588
- Jack...? Marty.
- Hey, what's going on?

01:34:00.297 --> 01:34:03.467
Sorry to interrupt the party,
but you need to know right away.

01:34:03.676 --> 01:34:08.472
- SAS made positive I.D. On Cooley.
- What about the others?

01:34:08.681 --> 01:34:10.558
It's pretty messy.

01:34:10.766 --> 01:34:13.811
We need to verify the dental records.

01:34:14.020 --> 01:34:17.648
But they're on top of it.

01:34:17.857 --> 01:34:20.151
- Oh, great.
- What?

01:34:20.359 --> 01:34:23.612
The storm caused a black-out.
I've got to light candles.

01:34:23.821 --> 01:34:28.284
- I'll light one for you too.
- OK, Marty, thanks.

01:34:29.744 --> 01:34:33.164
- Here we go!
- What? Forget to pay your bill?

01:34:33.372 --> 01:34:36.625
- Robert...! Funny.
- Is everyone all right?

01:34:36.834 --> 01:34:44.091
Fine, Jack. This doesn't happen often,
Lord Holmes. Only when royalty visit.

01:34:51.015 --> 01:34:54.101
- Is something wrong?
- Come with me.

01:34:57.104 --> 01:35:00.983
If the storm had cut the lights,
they'd be out in the boathouse too.

01:35:01.192 --> 01:35:06.447
Power comes in from the street,
branching off to here.

01:35:06.655 --> 01:35:12.453
Jesus...
This is Ryan. Any DSS agent?

01:35:13.537 --> 01:35:19.126
Any DSS agent? This is Ryan.
Federal Troopers. Anyone?

01:35:19.335 --> 01:35:23.381
Is anyone reading me? Anybody?

01:35:24.382 --> 01:35:30.638
- Can I play when the lights go on?
- Sweetie pie, you need some sleep.

01:35:30.846 --> 01:35:32.515
Goddamnit!

01:35:37.103 --> 01:35:41.357
- Don't tell me.
- Quite a storm.

01:35:45.861 --> 01:35:50.241
Take your hands off me.
What do you think you're doing?

01:35:54.245 --> 01:35:56.998
- Gun!
- Jack!

01:36:09.301 --> 01:36:11.554
Stay right there!

01:36:14.098 --> 01:36:16.726
Rob, over here.

01:36:22.189 --> 01:36:25.192
How many are coming?
Where's Sean Miller?

01:36:25.401 --> 01:36:30.156
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Give me the gun.

01:36:33.451 --> 01:36:36.454
Five, six... maybe more.

01:36:36.662 --> 01:36:40.124
I'll get the others.
Don't turn on the lights.

01:36:47.298 --> 01:36:51.886
- Take this. In the basement, quick!
- Cathy's upstairs putting Sally to bed.

01:36:52.094 --> 01:36:53.679
What's wrong?

01:37:21.916 --> 01:37:25.628
Come on, Ryan. Show yourself.

01:37:29.465 --> 01:37:31.634
- Annette, upstairs.
- Right.

01:37:48.901 --> 01:37:51.153
Come on, sweetie.
Come on.

01:37:51.362 --> 01:37:54.156
What's wrong, Mommy?

01:37:55.199 --> 01:37:58.494
Now, you've got to help.
Hide behind the suits.

01:38:12.174 --> 01:38:15.928
Oh, God, Jack.
What did you do with the shells?

01:38:20.141 --> 01:38:21.934
Go, go, go!

01:39:11.817 --> 01:39:13.444
Get down!

01:39:34.340 --> 01:39:35.675
Get back!

01:39:48.562 --> 01:39:50.189
You all right?

01:39:50.398 --> 01:39:53.359
- Daddy.
- Sally! It's OK, honey.

01:39:57.029 --> 01:39:59.073
Come on, come on!

01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:24.098
Honey,
you just got to be real quiet.

01:40:42.867 --> 01:40:44.618
Gotcha!

01:41:12.355 --> 01:41:13.689
Christ!

01:41:23.032 --> 01:41:24.659
Come on.

01:41:41.050 --> 01:41:48.265
- Who is off the air?
- DSS, state troopers, the security rep.

01:41:48.474 --> 01:41:51.102
Give me Hostage Rescue, now!

01:41:56.065 --> 01:42:00.236
Robby...! Open up!
Robby, it's us.

01:42:00.444 --> 01:42:02.279
Jack!

01:42:04.281 --> 01:42:09.578
- They're outside.
- Cool it. Can't ransom a dead Royal.

01:42:12.039 --> 01:42:15.751
- They're all over the place.
- Stay close to me.

01:42:18.462 --> 01:42:24.468
How were you going to get away?
Want to go for the other knee?

01:42:24.677 --> 01:42:29.181
Boats. At the bottom of the cliff.
There are ropes.

01:42:29.390 --> 01:42:30.850
Kevin!

01:43:40.378 --> 01:43:43.005
You've killed him!

01:44:35.474 --> 01:44:39.270
No, Sean. No!
We need Holmes alive.

01:44:39.478 --> 01:44:42.732
- We're past that.
- Alive!

01:44:52.700 --> 01:44:54.285
Come on!

01:45:15.723 --> 01:45:19.769
- Any contact?
- Still off the air.

01:45:41.082 --> 01:45:43.084
There he is!

01:45:52.468 --> 01:45:53.969
Stay down!

01:46:20.538 --> 01:46:23.499
Come on, you bastards!

01:46:27.461 --> 01:46:29.547
Come on! Come on!

01:46:31.132 --> 01:46:35.970
He's alone. He's leading us away from
the Royal. Turn around, Sean.

01:46:36.178 --> 01:46:38.889
- No!
- Turn it around, Sean.

01:46:39.098 --> 01:46:41.017
- No!
- Sean!

01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:45.104
Turn around!

01:46:45.312 --> 01:46:49.650
- Forget about Ryan.
- Don't blow the mission now, boy!

01:46:49.859 --> 01:46:52.403
That's not my mission.

01:46:58.117 --> 01:47:00.244
You crazy bastard!

01:51:18.544 --> 01:51:22.173
- Had enough to eat? Some toast?
- Pancakes.

01:51:22.381 --> 01:51:27.261
- No time for pancakes. Want toast?
- Toast.

01:51:27.470 --> 01:51:30.389
- Somebody going to get that?
- Getting it.

01:51:30.598 --> 01:51:36.270
- Sally.
- Hello. Yes, it is. Hold on a second.

01:51:37.271 --> 01:51:40.566
- It's Dr. Zaillian.
- The amnio.

01:51:40.775 --> 01:51:45.112
- Hello.
- Is it gonna be OK?

01:51:45.321 --> 01:51:50.660
It's gonna be fine, honey.
We're just waiting to find out.

01:51:52.703 --> 01:51:56.791
- Great!
- Want strawberry on your toast?

01:51:56.999 --> 01:52:00.628
Hold on...
Want to know what it is?

01:52:00.836 --> 01:52:03.714
- Did he tell you?
- He's asking. I'm asking you.

01:52:03.923 --> 01:52:08.511
- I don't know. Do you want to know?
- I don't know. Do you?

01:52:08.719 --> 01:52:12.098
I wanted to know,
but now I'm not sure.

01:52:12.306 --> 01:52:16.769
- Hold on. We're discussing it.
- Neither. I do and I don't.

01:52:19.897 --> 01:52:21.899
He's waiting.

01:52:26.654 --> 01:52:30.741
OK...! Tell us.

01:52:30.950 --> 01:52:32.576
OK, tell us.

01:52:37.707 --> 01:52:39.041
Thank you!
