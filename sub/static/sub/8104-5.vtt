WEBVTT

00:06.298 --> 00:08.883
We are condemned to useless labor.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.885
Fourth circle of hell.

00:11.011 --> 00:15.098
Charting goes a lot faster
when you eliminate all classic poetry.

00:15.224 --> 00:18.184
Writing down what we already know
to be read by nobody.

00:18.310 --> 00:20.895
I'm pretty sure Dante would agree
that qualifies as useless.

00:21.021 --> 00:24.023
You're over two weeks behind
in your charting.

00:25.442 --> 00:26.984
Oops. I missed.

00:27.111 --> 00:28.820
What are you, eight?

00:28.987 --> 00:30.446
Could an eight year old do this?

00:31.156 --> 00:33.991
You'd better stop,
or it'll stick that way.

00:34.118 --> 00:35.993
You have a patient in Exam 1.

00:36.120 --> 00:38.746
Yeah, but, see, I'm off at 12:00,
and it's already five of.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.541
She's been waiting for you since 11:00.

00:45.003 --> 00:47.004
Melancholy without hope.

00:47.131 --> 00:49.340
Which circle is that?

00:55.055 --> 00:57.640
Hi. I'm Dr. House.

00:57.766 --> 00:59.016
What seems to be the problem?

00:59.143 --> 01:01.018
Show him your hands, Augustine.

01:09.403 --> 01:10.611
It looks like stigmata.

01:11.822 --> 01:12.655
Pius.

01:12.781 --> 01:15.950
You must be all the talk
around the "holy water" cooler.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.869
Been washing a lot of dishes recently?

01:17.995 --> 01:19.203
I help out in the kitchen.

01:19.329 --> 01:20.329
Anything new in the kitchen?

01:20.456 --> 01:23.708
We just got a donation of saucepans
and pots this week.

01:23.834 --> 01:24.792
I unpacked and washed them.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.753
Should have spent your time
saving souls.

01:26.879 --> 01:28.588
It's easier on the hands.

01:28.714 --> 01:30.214
This is contact dermatitis.

01:30.382 --> 01:31.924
You're allergic to dish soap.

01:32.050 --> 01:34.594
Nonsense.
We've always used that soap.

01:34.720 --> 01:36.554
Why is there a problem now?

01:36.680 --> 01:38.347
I've been a doctor for years.

01:38.474 --> 01:40.767
Why do I have to keep assuring people
that I know what I'm doing?

01:40.893 --> 01:43.311
A person can become
allergic to substances

01:43.437 --> 01:46.647
that they've had repeated
and prolonged exposure to.

01:46.774 --> 01:50.151
The good news is free samples.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.738
Diphenhydramine. It's an antihistamine.

01:53.864 --> 01:56.824
It'll stop the allergic reaction.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.409
Take one every eight hours.

01:58.535 --> 01:59.911
It might make you feel a little sleepy.

02:00.037 --> 02:02.705
And get some of that over-the-counter
cortisone cream.

02:02.831 --> 02:03.831
Thank you, Doctor.

02:03.957 --> 02:04.957
You want some water?

02:05.083 --> 02:06.250
I have some tea.

02:06.376 --> 02:08.044
Well, you just relax for a few minutes.

02:08.170 --> 02:10.254
That stuff works pretty fast.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.514
Still out by 12:00.

02:19.640 --> 02:22.475
How do you solve a problem
like dermatitis?

02:22.601 --> 02:24.644
- What?
- Doctor?

02:24.770 --> 02:27.897
I want to thank you for your patience.

02:28.023 --> 02:29.732
She talking to you?

02:29.858 --> 02:32.235
I don't know.
She's certainly looking at me.

02:32.361 --> 02:35.780
Oh, it's good to get
a secular diagnosis.

02:35.906 --> 02:39.200
The sisters tend to interpret
their illnesses as divine intervention.

02:39.326 --> 02:40.326
And you don't?

02:40.452 --> 02:42.161
Then you're wearing
an awfully funny hat.

02:42.287 --> 02:44.789
Ooh, boy. Excuse me.

02:44.915 --> 02:48.167
If I break my leg,
I believe it happened for a reason.

02:48.293 --> 02:50.294
I believe God wanted me
to break my leg.

02:50.420 --> 02:53.840
I also believe He wants me
to put a cast on it.

02:53.966 --> 02:55.633
Doctor! Something's wrong.

03:05.561 --> 03:07.186
Lift up your chin.

03:09.898 --> 03:12.650
Sister, you're having an asthma attack.
I need you to relax.

03:12.776 --> 03:14.610
Roll up her sleeve, please.

03:14.778 --> 03:16.612
I'm gonna give you epinephrine.

03:16.738 --> 03:19.657
It'll open your lungs
and help you breathe.

03:38.302 --> 03:39.594
What happened?

03:39.720 --> 03:40.678
Did she take the pill?

03:40.804 --> 03:41.637
Yes.

03:41.763 --> 03:43.681
It's probably an allergic reaction.

03:43.807 --> 03:46.601
She's allergic to
an anti-allergy medicine?

03:46.727 --> 03:49.020
You figure somebody's out to get her?

03:49.146 --> 03:50.563
- How are you feeling?
- Better.

03:50.689 --> 03:52.982
I'll put you on some steroids instead.

03:53.108 --> 03:55.318
Is my heart supposed
to be feeling so funny?

03:55.444 --> 03:58.738
It's called adrenaline.
It makes your heart beat fast.

04:00.699 --> 04:02.825
But not this fast.

04:02.951 --> 04:04.702
Get a nurse, please.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.123
Help! Somebody help us!

04:12.794 --> 04:14.795
Somebody get in here!

04:17.049 --> 04:18.883
Call a code
and charge up a defibrillator.

04:19.051 --> 04:20.885
She's got no pulse.

05:19.027 --> 05:22.279
You diagnosed the patient with
allergies and prescribed antihistamine.

05:22.406 --> 05:24.865
She went into respiratory distress,

05:24.992 --> 05:28.744
and you injected her with epinephrine.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.121
Presumably 1 cc.

05:30.247 --> 05:33.541
0.1 cc. That is the standard dose.
That is what I gave her.

05:33.667 --> 05:36.335
People don't go into cardiac arrest
from 0.1 cc epinephrine.

05:36.461 --> 05:38.004
She must have
a preexisting heart condition

05:38.130 --> 05:39.755
that got exacerbated
by the epinephrine.

05:39.881 --> 05:42.174
It's too bad you didn't make
a notation in the chart.

05:42.300 --> 05:43.300
I can make it up right now.

05:43.427 --> 05:45.219
The drawer has syringes
with both dosages.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.679
You could've easily reached
for the wrong...

05:46.805 --> 05:47.763
But I didn't.

05:47.889 --> 05:48.806
Everyone makes mistakes.

05:48.932 --> 05:51.767
This is why doctors pay through
the nose for malpractice insurance.

05:51.893 --> 05:53.728
Relax. They're not gonna sue.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.980
The worst they'd do
is whack my hand with a ruler.

05:56.106 --> 05:58.315
And the discipline board, are they
gonna whack your hand, too?

05:58.442 --> 05:59.400
You're gonna report me?

05:59.526 --> 06:01.152
What choice do I have?

06:01.945 --> 06:03.946
How about not report me?

06:05.866 --> 06:09.702
I can justify keeping her here
for a 24-hour observation.

06:09.828 --> 06:11.495
If you haven't found
an underlying cause

06:11.621 --> 06:12.663
for the cardiac arrest by then,

06:12.789 --> 06:15.416
I will have to notify our attorneys.

06:21.798 --> 06:22.923
Her hands were red
and swollen.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.675
Maybe she has a skin infection.
Cellulitis?

06:24.843 --> 06:26.260
That could manifest with tachycardia.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.845
There's no history of fever.

06:27.971 --> 06:29.847
Results from the CBC
didn't indicate an infection.

06:29.973 --> 06:31.974
The eosinophils are mildly elevated.
Sed rate's up a bit.

06:32.100 --> 06:33.559
Could we be looking at
a systemic allergic response?

06:33.685 --> 06:36.729
It's not allergic. Allergies don't
cause cardiac arrest like this.

06:36.855 --> 06:38.105
Could be inflammation of
the blood vessels.

06:38.231 --> 06:41.150
Vasculitis? That wouldn't give you
an elevated eosinophil count.

06:41.276 --> 06:43.069
Churg-Strauss vasculitis would.

06:43.195 --> 06:45.821
The blood vessels of the heart,
lungs and skin become inflamed,

06:45.947 --> 06:48.532
causing the asthma,
rash and heart problems,

06:48.658 --> 06:49.867
covers all her symptoms.

06:49.993 --> 06:50.868
You need a biopsy to diagnose.

06:50.994 --> 06:52.036
Chest CT would be quicker.

06:52.162 --> 06:54.705
The lady just came in with a rash.

06:55.165 --> 06:57.166
What the hell are those?

06:57.292 --> 06:58.918
Candy canes.

06:59.044 --> 07:03.005
Candy canes? Are you mocking me?

07:03.131 --> 07:06.759
No. It's Christmas, and I...

07:06.885 --> 07:08.010
I thought...

07:08.303 --> 07:09.970
Relax. It's a joke.

07:10.097 --> 07:12.765
Isn't the prognosis
for Churg-Strauss a bit grim?

07:12.891 --> 07:16.936
Yeah. Untreated, only 33% of patients
survive past a year.

07:17.062 --> 07:18.104
Treated, five years.

07:18.230 --> 07:19.855
Then I definitely suggest treatment.

07:19.981 --> 07:21.649
If it was any other attending doctor,

07:21.775 --> 07:25.069
I'd say that he made a mistake
and gave her too much epinephrine.

07:25.195 --> 07:27.696
Saying you wouldn't say
it was my mistake

07:27.823 --> 07:30.032
is saying it was my mistake.

07:30.909 --> 07:33.661
Everyone screws up. Your rule.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.871
I think you fit
within the subset of "everyone."

07:35.997 --> 07:38.249
I didn't screw up.

07:38.375 --> 07:42.419
Order a chest CT and start the sister
on prednisone, 40 milligrams TID.

07:42.546 --> 07:43.796
The sister?

07:43.922 --> 07:47.550
Oh, didn't I mention?
The patient's a nun, Sister Augustine.

07:49.136 --> 07:50.636
I hate nuns.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.639
Who doesn't?

08:06.361 --> 08:07.987
Sister Augustine?

08:08.155 --> 08:09.780
We weren't watching.

08:09.906 --> 08:12.616
We were trying to see
if this is the bed control.

08:12.742 --> 08:15.369
Oh, this one's the bed control.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.454
And that's the TV control.

08:18.206 --> 08:21.292
I'm Dr. Cameron.
This is Dr. Chase and Dr. Foreman.

08:21.418 --> 08:24.211
I haven't seen television
in over 20 years.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.754
Do you consider it
the work of the devil,

08:25.881 --> 08:29.008
or do you just not get cable
where you live?

08:30.427 --> 08:31.927
How are you feeling, Sister?

08:32.053 --> 08:34.471
I seem to be a little better.
They gave me some medication.

08:34.598 --> 08:37.391
Prednisone. It's a steroid to help with
the inflammation.

08:37.517 --> 08:40.394
Has Dr. House figured out what I have?
Will I be okay?

08:40.520 --> 08:41.812
We're not sure what's wrong yet.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.355
You'll have a chest CT scan
this afternoon

08:43.481 --> 08:44.857
that'll help with the diagnosis.

08:44.983 --> 08:46.483
Dr. House is giving her medication,

08:46.610 --> 08:48.110
and he doesn't know what she has yet?

08:48.236 --> 08:49.612
Trust, Sister Pius.

08:49.738 --> 08:51.155
It all happens for a reason.

08:52.324 --> 08:53.824
He doesn't know
what he's doing.

08:53.950 --> 08:55.284
The only problem that woman has

08:55.410 --> 08:56.827
is that House grabbed
the wrong syringe.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.120
You don't trust him?

08:58.246 --> 09:00.956
I don't trust a man who won't admit
he might be wrong.

09:01.082 --> 09:03.375
I notice you weren't so quick
to tell her she's got Churg-Strauss

09:03.501 --> 09:04.668
and only has a couple years left.

09:04.794 --> 09:06.503
I don't tell patients bad news
unless it's conclusive.

09:06.630 --> 09:08.297
Because you know he might be wrong.

09:08.423 --> 09:10.674
About Churg-Strauss.
Not about what happened in the clinic.

09:10.800 --> 09:14.470
What about you, Chase?
You think he's infallible, too?

09:14.596 --> 09:16.722
All I know is,
if House didn't make a mistake

09:16.848 --> 09:18.766
and Sister Augustine has Churg-Strauss,

09:18.892 --> 09:21.644
he'll be self-satisfied and our lives
will be good for a few weeks.

09:21.770 --> 09:23.896
If House did make a mistake,
he'll be upset

09:24.022 --> 09:25.773
and our lives will be miserable
for months.

09:25.899 --> 09:26.941
There is that.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.276
If Cuddy thinks I made a mistake,
the least she could do

09:29.402 --> 09:30.945
is suspend me from clinic duty.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.697
She doesn't confuse making a mistake
with being incompetent.

09:33.823 --> 09:36.158
Oh, here we go. Lesson time.

09:37.827 --> 09:40.246
I recognize that confidence
is not my short suit.

09:40.372 --> 09:42.957
I also recognize that I am human
and capable of error.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.875
So you might have screwed this up?

09:45.001 --> 09:46.043
No.

09:46.169 --> 09:48.504
So it's merely a theoretical capacity
for error.

09:48.630 --> 09:49.588
Good point.

09:49.714 --> 09:52.258
Maybe there isn't one.
Maybe that's my error.

09:52.384 --> 09:54.093
You know, most people who think
as much of themselves

09:54.219 --> 09:55.552
as you do like to talk about
themselves.

09:55.679 --> 09:56.887
Most people don't like to listen.

09:57.013 --> 09:58.973
So, what's wrong with you?

10:10.568 --> 10:12.945
Let me guess, inflammatory bowel.

10:14.155 --> 10:16.323
Wow. Yeah. Is it that bad?

10:16.449 --> 10:17.950
Yes.

10:18.159 --> 10:20.494
It's also written on your chart.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.705
"Bloody diarrhea, gas, pain."

10:22.831 --> 10:24.832
"Took sulfasalazine,
but it didn't work."

10:24.958 --> 10:26.250
No. Then... Then I...

10:26.376 --> 10:27.793
"Next, tried steroid enemas."

10:27.919 --> 10:31.046
"Oral corticosteroids 5-ASA,
6-mercaptopurine."

10:31.172 --> 10:32.006
I'm impressed.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.465
By my medical history?

10:33.591 --> 10:35.801
By how well your last doctor charted.

10:35.927 --> 10:38.220
It's one thing to have to go to
the bathroom every hour,

10:38.346 --> 10:41.348
but when the kids sit on my lap,
it's...

10:41.474 --> 10:42.933
The store sent me home.
They're gonna fire me.

10:43.059 --> 10:45.561
Can't you put me back on 5-ASA?
Maybe it'll work this time.

10:45.687 --> 10:46.729
Not likely.

10:46.855 --> 10:49.523
I'm giving you a prescription.
It's cheap, which is good,

10:49.649 --> 10:52.776
because your insurance company
won't pay for it.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.660
"Cogaritis"?

11:01.828 --> 11:03.579
Cigarettes.

11:03.705 --> 11:05.748
One, twice a day. No more, no less.

11:05.874 --> 11:07.791
Studies have shown
that cigarette smoking

11:07.917 --> 11:11.045
is one of the most effective ways
to control inflammatory bowel.

11:11.171 --> 11:14.298
Plus it's been well established
that you look 30% cooler.

11:14.424 --> 11:15.841
Are you kidding me?

11:15.967 --> 11:18.552
About the looking cooler, yeah.
The rest is true.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.721
Isn't it addictive and dangerous?

11:20.847 --> 11:24.016
Pretty much all the drugs I prescribe
are addictive and dangerous.

11:24.142 --> 11:28.020
The only difference with this one is
it's completely legal.

11:29.230 --> 11:30.981
Merry Christmas.

11:31.566 --> 11:35.527
I was talking to
the nurse. Arsenio. Do you know him?

11:35.653 --> 11:36.612
Not really.

11:36.738 --> 11:38.781
He can take pictures with his phone.

11:38.907 --> 11:40.157
Cool.

11:40.283 --> 11:42.576
That woman from the lab
was interesting, too.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.662
She studied astrophysics
before becoming a nurse.

11:45.789 --> 11:47.331
You know the staff better than I do.

11:47.457 --> 11:49.249
I love to hear all about people.

11:49.376 --> 11:50.918
Yet you live in a monastery.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.587
It's where I serve our Lord
and the world best.

11:53.713 --> 11:57.383
Our Lord, maybe. The rest of the world,
on the other hand,

11:57.509 --> 11:59.510
would probably get more out of
feeding the homeless or...

11:59.636 --> 12:00.844
Healing the sick?

12:00.970 --> 12:02.346
As an example, yeah.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.681
Did you always want to be a doctor?

12:04.808 --> 12:05.933
Always.

12:06.059 --> 12:06.975
You always want to be a nun?

12:07.102 --> 12:08.977
My parents died when I was six.

12:09.104 --> 12:12.606
I was raised in a foster home
run by the Church.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.775
When I was 18, I went to the monastery,

12:14.901 --> 12:16.944
where they let me take my vows.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.988
I've known no other life,
and I haven't wanted to.

12:20.573 --> 12:23.700
Okay, Sister. We need you
to lie as still as possible.

12:23.827 --> 12:25.702
If you get scared, just let us know.

12:25.829 --> 12:28.247
As Jonah said from inside the whale,

12:28.373 --> 12:33.085
"When I had lost all hope,
I turned my thoughts to the Lord."

12:33.211 --> 12:34.586
Well, she's got God on her side.

12:34.712 --> 12:35.796
I don't believe in God.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.798
You're not even a little agnostic?

12:37.924 --> 12:39.925
Is it supposed to smell funny?

12:40.051 --> 12:41.802
Someone ralphed in there this morning.

12:41.928 --> 12:44.138
We cleaned it up, but...

12:44.264 --> 12:47.641
It's normal, Sister.
It's just a few more minutes.

12:47.767 --> 12:50.519
I believe in a higher order that's
in control of what happens,

12:50.645 --> 12:53.021
but not one anthropomorphic entity
called "God"

12:53.148 --> 12:55.607
that's concerned with the everyday
workings of you and me.

12:55.733 --> 12:58.318
What else is there to control but the
everyday workings of you and me?

12:58.445 --> 13:00.654
It's always about you, Foreman.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.364
What are you talking about?
The trees, the fish?

13:02.490 --> 13:04.616
Should they be the ones that think
it's all about them?

13:04.742 --> 13:07.703
What about you, Chase?
Do you believe in God?

13:08.830 --> 13:11.957
I believe Sister Augustine
has no vascular pathology,

13:12.083 --> 13:13.125
which means no Churg-Strauss.

13:13.251 --> 13:14.376
Which means House made a mistake.

13:14.502 --> 13:15.544
No, not necessarily.

13:15.670 --> 13:18.380
It could be something else,
thyrotoxicosis or a carcinoid.

13:18.506 --> 13:20.632
I don't get you.
You don't believe in God,

13:20.758 --> 13:22.968
but you're willing to put
complete faith in one man?

13:23.094 --> 13:25.596
Please. The smell.

13:25.722 --> 13:27.598
Let's get her out of there.

13:28.808 --> 13:29.975
I'm coming, Sister. I got you.

13:30.101 --> 13:32.686
- Please. The smell.
- I'm coming.

13:32.812 --> 13:33.812
I'm gonna be sick.

13:33.938 --> 13:34.897
There's no smell.

13:35.023 --> 13:40.319
No. God. Oh! It's Jesus. It's Jesus!

13:40.987 --> 13:43.071
He's coming for me!

13:43.198 --> 13:45.324
He's burning me with his touch!

13:45.450 --> 13:47.409
Let's get her on some Ativan.

13:47.535 --> 13:49.244
The smells, religious visions,

13:49.370 --> 13:50.996
it's symptomatic of
temporal lobe swelling.

13:51.122 --> 13:52.789
We don't want her to...

13:52.916 --> 13:55.667
She's seizing. Jaw block!

13:55.793 --> 13:57.169
Help me get her on her side.

13:59.005 --> 14:00.297
Religious visions?

14:00.423 --> 14:02.382
Yeah. And next comes...

14:10.099 --> 14:12.184
Patient tested positive
for herpetic encephalitis.

14:12.310 --> 14:13.310
What's that tell us?

14:13.436 --> 14:14.895
Her immune system is
severely compromised.

14:15.021 --> 14:18.023
Oh, I know. Prednisone compromises
the immune system.

14:18.149 --> 14:19.441
Isn't that the medicine
that you gave her

14:19.567 --> 14:20.734
for that thing she doesn't have?

14:20.860 --> 14:23.570
Yeah, that... Hey!

14:24.239 --> 14:25.822
I'm thinking that's a trick question.

14:25.949 --> 14:28.200
Her immune system is
severely compromised.

14:28.326 --> 14:30.035
Two doses of prednisone
wouldn't do that.

14:30.161 --> 14:32.829
Are you hanging your diagnosis
on an adverb?

14:32.956 --> 14:34.748
In 10 seconds, I'm going to announce

14:34.874 --> 14:36.583
that I gave her the wrong dose
in the clinic.

14:36.709 --> 14:37.918
You're gonna admit negligence?

14:38.044 --> 14:39.461
Unless you leave the room.

14:39.587 --> 14:41.463
If you stay, you'll have to testify.

14:42.674 --> 14:45.008
Five, four,

14:45.134 --> 14:47.511
three, two...

14:47.637 --> 14:49.638
So, there I was in the clinic, drunk.

14:49.764 --> 14:51.390
I opened the drawer, closed my eyes,

14:51.516 --> 14:54.393
take the first syringe I can find...

14:56.020 --> 14:59.189
So, what are the options for
a compromised immune system?

14:59.315 --> 15:01.108
Mixed connective tissue disease.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.902
It'd explain why she was feeling better
on the prednisone.

15:04.028 --> 15:07.030
Sure. She was feeling better right up
to the moment it almost killed her.

15:07.156 --> 15:09.950
On the other hand,
it explains the symptoms,

15:10.076 --> 15:12.911
swollen hands, pulmonary problems,
cardiac problems. It all fits.

15:13.037 --> 15:14.788
Except her ANA was normal.

15:14.914 --> 15:15.872
So redraw the blood.

15:15.999 --> 15:17.082
But the treatment is corticosteroids,

15:17.208 --> 15:19.918
prednisone, and we can't go there
because of the encephalitis.

15:20.044 --> 15:21.295
Then we'll treat it with something

15:21.421 --> 15:23.964
that modulates the immune system,
but doesn't suppress it,

15:24.090 --> 15:25.632
hyperbaric oxygen chamber.

15:25.758 --> 15:29.219
There's no protocol for putting a
patient in a high-pressure oxygen room

15:29.345 --> 15:30.804
to treat auto-immune problems.

15:30.930 --> 15:34.016
Oh, you people.
Always with the protocols.

15:35.184 --> 15:38.937
Prep the nun
and discontinue the prednisone.

15:45.111 --> 15:47.821
I am both amused and annoyed

15:47.947 --> 15:51.575
that you think I should be
less stubborn than you are.

15:51.701 --> 15:54.786
You are aware of the Hippocratic oath,
right?

15:55.204 --> 15:57.039
The one that starts,
"First, do no harm,"

15:57.165 --> 15:59.333
then goes on to tell us no abortions,
no seductions,

15:59.459 --> 16:02.044
and definitely no cutting of those
who labor beneath the stone?

16:02.170 --> 16:04.129
Yeah. I took a read once.
Wasn't impressed.

16:04.255 --> 16:05.839
Hyperbaric treatments could cause

16:05.965 --> 16:08.133
oxygen toxicity, lung and eye damage.

16:08.259 --> 16:09.593
Every treatment has its dangers.

16:09.719 --> 16:10.969
Which is why we only treat

16:11.095 --> 16:13.805
if we're convinced the patient
actually needs the treatment.

16:13.931 --> 16:16.266
I'm convinced. You're not.

16:17.185 --> 16:20.270
Question is,
what are you gonna do about it?

16:22.690 --> 16:24.775
I have an opening Thursday at 3:00.

16:24.901 --> 16:26.234
Do you have a fourth?

16:26.653 --> 16:27.694
Is he any good?

16:29.155 --> 16:31.615
Can I call you right back? Okay.

16:33.660 --> 16:34.951
What's up?

16:38.539 --> 16:39.706
The pressure
will force the oxygen

16:39.832 --> 16:41.875
into your system, saturate your blood.

16:42.001 --> 16:44.961
It will enhance white cell activity,
reduce the inflammation.

16:45.088 --> 16:48.548
And that will help with this mixed
connective tissue disease?

16:48.675 --> 16:51.968
We'll be doing about 10 treatments,
and then we'll reevaluate.

16:52.136 --> 16:55.597
The last treatment
with prednisone caused the seizures.

16:55.723 --> 16:58.725
How confident is Dr. House about this?

16:58.851 --> 17:01.353
That you reacted so strongly
to the prednisone let us know

17:01.479 --> 17:04.022
that you had an underlying problem with
your immune system.

17:04.148 --> 17:07.734
I guess it was a blessing, of sorts.

17:12.073 --> 17:14.408
So, who's your favorite reindeer, Nurse
Arnold?

17:14.534 --> 17:15.575
Rudolph.

17:15.702 --> 17:16.576
I would've thought it was Vixen.

17:16.703 --> 17:17.786
What are you implying?

17:17.912 --> 17:19.121
Nothing.

17:19.247 --> 17:21.915
But I saw you at the Christmas party
with Dr. Miles,

17:22.041 --> 17:25.085
and Dr. Jorkins and Nurse Crandall.

17:25.211 --> 17:27.045
I was just doing some
Christmas dancing.

17:27.171 --> 17:30.549
This is a chapel, a house of prayer.

17:31.801 --> 17:33.552
House of prayer?

17:34.595 --> 17:37.097
That explains the good reception.

17:37.223 --> 17:39.433
Also why nobody's ever here.

17:41.269 --> 17:43.562
I need to talk with you, Dr. House.

17:43.688 --> 17:46.982
Sister Augustine believes in things
that aren't real.

17:47.942 --> 17:51.027
I thought that was a job requirement
for you people.

17:51.154 --> 17:54.698
She's been known to lie
to get sympathy.

17:54.824 --> 17:56.825
She's a hypochondriac.

17:56.951 --> 18:00.996
So you're warning me that I may be
treating a nonexistent ailment.

18:01.122 --> 18:03.790
Sore throats, joint pains.

18:03.916 --> 18:06.376
There's always something wrong,
and there's never a reason for it.

18:06.502 --> 18:08.962
Mother Superior plays right into it,

18:09.088 --> 18:11.214
lets Augustine off work duties,

18:11.340 --> 18:14.426
treating her as fragile, special.

18:14.552 --> 18:16.553
That must make you angry.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.389
It bothers me.

18:19.515 --> 18:22.601
It's not really
in Augustine's best interests.

18:26.856 --> 18:28.273
You want some?

18:29.817 --> 18:31.109
I shouldn't.

18:36.866 --> 18:40.994
I guess you gotta be good at reading
people to be a good infirmarian?

18:42.455 --> 18:46.082
So, we've got pride,
anger, envy, gluttony.

18:47.001 --> 18:50.253
That's four out of seven deadly sins
in under two minutes.

18:50.379 --> 18:55.383
Do you people keep records of
these things? Is there a "Cathlympics"?

18:55.510 --> 18:56.968
They say you have a gift.

18:57.094 --> 18:58.345
They like to talk.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.013
You hide behind your intelligence.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.556
Yeah. That's pretty stupid.

19:01.682 --> 19:05.227
And you make jokes because you're
afraid to take anything seriously.

19:05.353 --> 19:07.646
Because if you take things seriously,
they matter.

19:07.772 --> 19:08.772
And if they matter...

19:08.898 --> 19:10.690
When things go wrong, I get hurt.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.192
I'm not tough. I'm vulnerable.

19:12.360 --> 19:13.985
I barely know you.

19:14.111 --> 19:15.195
And I don't know if I'm right.

19:15.321 --> 19:17.072
I just hope I am.

19:17.365 --> 19:19.950
Because the alternative is

19:20.076 --> 19:23.119
you really are as miserable as
you seem to be.

19:25.498 --> 19:28.208
You know, from the way you're looking
at me right now,

19:28.334 --> 19:30.877
I'd say you just hit number five.

19:31.546 --> 19:32.712
Lust.

19:46.352 --> 19:48.854
Dr. Brown, I love you, too.

19:57.697 --> 19:58.989
How are you feeling?

19:59.115 --> 20:00.490
A little weak.

20:00.616 --> 20:01.992
That's from the oxygen.

20:02.118 --> 20:03.577
My mouth is dry.

20:03.703 --> 20:07.163
Okay. Well,
I'll get you some of your tea.

20:09.417 --> 20:11.084
Mixed connective tissue disease?

20:11.210 --> 20:13.044
Her ANA is barely elevated.

20:13.170 --> 20:14.588
Thanks for checking up on her.

20:14.714 --> 20:15.881
Good to know you got my back.

20:16.007 --> 20:17.924
O2 sat's down to 83.

20:18.092 --> 20:19.801
Pulmonary problems, breathing problems.

20:19.927 --> 20:21.928
Irritation from the oxygen is typical.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.389
She comes in with a rash,
and you put her into cardiac arrest.

20:24.515 --> 20:27.058
That well just never runs dry, does it?

20:27.184 --> 20:28.935
If there was no underlying problem,

20:29.103 --> 20:30.645
why is she still having
the rapid heart rate?

20:30.771 --> 20:33.273
Maybe from the herpetic encephalitis
caused by you giving her prednisone.

20:33.399 --> 20:35.609
Her reaction is a symptom,
not an error.

20:35.735 --> 20:36.776
There's always an explanation,
isn't there?

20:36.903 --> 20:37.903
Yes, there is.

20:38.029 --> 20:39.112
And if this one doesn't work,
we'll find another.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.822
But never one involving you
screwing up.

20:40.948 --> 20:42.699
One that fits all the facts.

20:42.825 --> 20:46.161
Look, we obviously have a difference of
opinion, and that's fine.

20:46.287 --> 20:48.747
But, unfortunately, I've used up
all the time I budgeted today

20:48.873 --> 20:50.206
for banging my head against a wall.

20:50.333 --> 20:53.043
I'm gonna do you the biggest favor
one doctor can do for another.

20:53.169 --> 20:56.254
I am gonna stop you from
killing your patient.

20:56.380 --> 20:58.173
You're off the case.

21:17.610 --> 21:18.693
We're gonna treat the symptoms.

21:18.819 --> 21:19.819
Not the underlying condition?

21:19.946 --> 21:20.987
There is no underlying condition.

21:21.113 --> 21:22.280
What's her status?

21:22.406 --> 21:24.449
The sister's breathing is labored.

21:24.575 --> 21:26.076
Pneumonitis from
the hyperbaric chamber.

21:26.202 --> 21:28.828
Put her on 40% oxygen
until her O2 sats increase.

21:28.955 --> 21:30.330
BUN and creatinine's rising.

21:30.456 --> 21:32.499
ALT and AST twice the normal range.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.584
Could be from the hypotensive episode.

21:34.752 --> 21:36.711
Let's follow them with labs.

21:36.837 --> 21:39.923
She still has the rash and joint pain
she came in with.

21:40.049 --> 21:41.174
Order a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.258
When we were looking

21:42.385 --> 21:44.636
at the differential diagnosis
with Dr. House, we were considering...

21:44.762 --> 21:46.972
I don't need to hear
what Dr. House was considering.

21:47.098 --> 21:51.226
All of this woman's symptoms can be
traced to Dr. House's considerations.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.813
Okay.

21:55.856 --> 21:57.691
Let's just get this patient healthy.

21:57.817 --> 22:00.485
I want her going out the front door
and not the back.

22:02.571 --> 22:04.447
Hey, it's not like I betrayed him.

22:04.573 --> 22:07.117
Cuddy would have found out about
the hyperbaric treatments eventually.

22:07.243 --> 22:09.703
You did what you thought you had to.

22:25.970 --> 22:28.179
Can't get enough of this place?

22:30.099 --> 22:31.850
Came for my stethoscope.

22:31.976 --> 22:34.728
So I shouldn't read too much into
the fact that you were looking for it

22:34.854 --> 22:37.272
in the drawer with
the epinephrine syringes in it?

22:38.733 --> 22:42.110
Okay. Yeah,
I'd like to clear my reputation.

22:42.236 --> 22:45.321
Oh, right. I forgot how much
you care about what people think.

22:45.448 --> 22:48.241
Prescribing cigarettes
for inflammatory bowel?

22:48.367 --> 22:50.702
That's... They cause lung cancer,
you know.

22:50.828 --> 22:53.246
You know why they have ribbons
for breast cancer,

22:53.372 --> 22:57.000
colorectal cancer, prostate cancer
and not for lung cancer?

22:57.126 --> 22:59.169
They ran out of colors?

22:59.295 --> 23:01.963
It's because people blame
lung cancer patients.

23:02.089 --> 23:03.965
They smoke. They screwed up.
They deserve to die.

23:04.091 --> 23:06.217
The reason people die from lung cancer
is guilt.

23:06.343 --> 23:07.635
Huh.

23:08.179 --> 23:11.181
Well, guilt does a lot of damage.

23:11.724 --> 23:13.933
You said that with great significance.

23:14.060 --> 23:16.102
You're not here to find
your stethoscope.

23:16.228 --> 23:18.813
You're not here to clear
your reputation.

23:18.939 --> 23:21.941
You're here because you're having
doubts. You might have screwed up.

23:22.068 --> 23:23.359
I'm here because, if I'm right,

23:23.486 --> 23:24.736
Cuddy is killing that patient.

23:24.862 --> 23:27.322
Okay. But if you're wrong?

23:29.992 --> 23:30.950
Then she's saving her.

23:31.077 --> 23:31.951
Fine.

23:32.078 --> 23:34.037
You're gonna have to go
through every record of every patient

23:34.163 --> 23:36.581
who's been through this clinic
in the last two days.

23:36.707 --> 23:39.834
And you're gonna have to hope
that those records can be trusted.

23:39.960 --> 23:42.170
Which, by the way, yours can't.

23:52.848 --> 23:54.474
These pills will help your
kidneys

23:54.600 --> 23:56.643
function a little better, Sister.

24:03.192 --> 24:04.859
Get your wrist?

24:07.738 --> 24:08.947
What's that?

24:09.615 --> 24:10.824
104.

24:11.742 --> 24:13.076
Is that good?

24:13.828 --> 24:15.161
It's fine.

24:16.080 --> 24:18.248
You're a lousy liar, Dr. Chase.

24:26.006 --> 24:28.174
I have to get this. Excuse me.

24:31.137 --> 24:33.763
My mother's been dead for 10 years.

24:34.765 --> 24:36.891
But she's always with you in spirit.

24:37.017 --> 24:38.351
What do you know about the nun?

24:38.477 --> 24:39.811
Which one?

24:39.937 --> 24:42.438
The cute one. I think she likes me.

24:42.565 --> 24:44.149
The sick one, obviously.

24:44.316 --> 24:45.859
Her parents died when she was a child,

24:45.985 --> 24:47.277
and she's been with the Church ever
since.

24:47.403 --> 24:48.611
What's she lying about?

24:48.737 --> 24:49.863
Why do you say that?

24:50.030 --> 24:51.322
I always say that.

24:51.448 --> 24:54.367
And the old nun thinks the sick nun is
a big fat nun liar.

24:54.493 --> 24:55.618
You know nuns. What do you think?

24:55.744 --> 24:56.870
I don't know nuns.

24:56.996 --> 25:00.373
You hate nuns. You can't hate someone
if you don't know them.

25:00.499 --> 25:03.042
Know any Nazis?
Maybe I hate them on principle.

25:04.295 --> 25:07.088
I have a theory about
what makes good boys good.

25:07.214 --> 25:09.757
It's not because of
some moral imperative.

25:09.884 --> 25:12.844
Good boys have the fear of God
put into them.

25:12.970 --> 25:15.805
Catholic Church specializes
in that kind of training

25:15.931 --> 25:18.892
to make good boys afraid of
divine retribution,

25:19.018 --> 25:20.935
so they'll do
what their daddies tell them,

25:21.061 --> 25:23.479
like, for example,
going into medical school

25:23.606 --> 25:25.815
when it's the last thing they wanna do.

25:25.941 --> 25:28.568
What do you think?

25:28.694 --> 25:32.113
I think, if she did have a secret,
her boss would know.

25:37.494 --> 25:39.621
Did you paint
or put in new carpets recently?

25:39.747 --> 25:40.788
No.

25:40.915 --> 25:42.582
Any way she could have got
access to drugs?

25:42.708 --> 25:44.959
We lock all our medications
in the infirmary,

25:45.085 --> 25:47.337
and we don't keep
prescription drugs here.

25:47.463 --> 25:51.799
Why haven't you asked Sister Augustine
about these things directly?

25:51.926 --> 25:54.010
I've found that when you want to
know the truth about someone,

25:54.136 --> 25:56.763
that someone is probably
the last person you should ask.

25:56.889 --> 25:57.847
Ah.

25:57.973 --> 26:00.767
And have you been speaking to
Sister Eucharist?

26:00.893 --> 26:03.478
She ratted out her fellow sister
pretty quickly.

26:03.604 --> 26:05.813
If I were you, I'd have
her repeat a year of nun school.

26:05.940 --> 26:09.108
Well, becoming a nun doesn't
make you a saint.

26:09.235 --> 26:10.735
Becoming a doctor
doesn't make you a healer.

26:11.987 --> 26:13.446
And just because
we live in a monastery,

26:13.572 --> 26:15.073
and we spend most of our time
in prayer,

26:15.199 --> 26:17.742
doesn't mean
we don't find time for drama.

26:17.868 --> 26:20.870
So, what is the sick one's drama?

26:20.996 --> 26:24.082
Sister Augustine lived
in Catholic foster care

26:24.208 --> 26:26.417
until she came to us.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.087
Tea?

26:29.213 --> 26:30.380
Sure.

26:33.175 --> 26:35.677
Do all of you lie?

26:35.803 --> 26:38.554
It's a good strategy, it's simpler
when you all tell the same lie.

26:38.681 --> 26:41.724
She has not spent her entire life
as a good Catholic.

26:41.850 --> 26:43.059
When she had a cardiac arrest,

26:43.185 --> 26:45.228
I had to open her blouse to do CPR.

26:45.354 --> 26:48.940
And I learned two things,
nuns can have nice breasts,

26:49.066 --> 26:52.902
and she has a tattoo
on her shoulder of a skunk.

26:54.321 --> 26:57.031
Now, maybe
it's the sacred skunk of Joseph,

26:57.157 --> 27:00.785
but as far as I know,
Catholic foster care and monasteries

27:00.911 --> 27:03.538
do not keep tattoo parlors
in their refectories.

27:03.664 --> 27:06.082
We consider that our life begins

27:06.208 --> 27:09.168
when we put on our habits
and take our vows.

27:10.462 --> 27:11.671
What happens before then...

27:11.797 --> 27:14.215
Is irrelevant to you,
but it's relevant to me.

27:18.554 --> 27:21.848
Sister Augustine went into foster care
when she was six years old,

27:21.974 --> 27:24.684
but she left when she was 12.

27:24.810 --> 27:27.770
She lived on the streets.
She got into drugs.

27:28.772 --> 27:31.024
When she was 15, she became pregnant.

27:31.150 --> 27:33.151
Tried to self-abort.

27:33.277 --> 27:35.903
She lost the child. She became ill.

27:36.030 --> 27:38.031
We took her in when she came back.

27:38.157 --> 27:42.410
If we had thought it was medically
relevant, we would have told you.

27:44.371 --> 27:45.705
It's not.

27:54.506 --> 27:58.426
This tea is delicious. Local herbs?

27:59.720 --> 28:00.845
Any change with the medication?

28:00.971 --> 28:02.555
Yes. She's getting worse.

28:02.681 --> 28:04.140
Lung function's deteriorating.

28:04.266 --> 28:06.017
BUN and creatinine continuing to rise.

28:06.143 --> 28:08.519
She's starting to run a fever,
and the rash is spreading.

28:08.645 --> 28:09.812
At this rate,
she's not gonna make Christmas.

28:09.938 --> 28:10.938
Maybe House is right.

28:11.065 --> 28:13.232
Maybe there is an underlying condition
that explains the symptoms.

28:13.359 --> 28:14.567
Something we haven't considered.

28:14.693 --> 28:15.610
Like what?

28:15.736 --> 28:16.944
It could be a metabolic disorder.

28:17.071 --> 28:19.113
- Specifically?
- Might be genetic.

28:19.239 --> 28:20.114
Specifically?

28:20.240 --> 28:21.115
I'm just saying...

28:21.241 --> 28:22.617
You're just saying
you think House is right.

28:22.743 --> 28:23.868
Might be right.

28:23.994 --> 28:25.036
Of course he might be right.

28:25.162 --> 28:27.580
It might be the hand of God at work.
Don't say it's something else

28:27.706 --> 28:30.708
unless you've got
something concrete to offer.

28:33.670 --> 28:34.670
What's this, hemlock?

28:34.797 --> 28:38.216
I'm gonna do you the biggest favor
one doctor can do another.

28:38.342 --> 28:40.676
I'm gonna stop you
from killing your patient.

28:41.428 --> 28:43.137
It's figwort tea,

28:43.263 --> 28:45.598
great for that little pick-me-up
we're all looking for in the morning.

28:45.724 --> 28:48.935
Opens the lungs, increases the blood
pressure, stimulates the heart.

28:49.061 --> 28:51.187
Unfortunately, if you then get injected

28:51.313 --> 28:54.148
with even 0.1 cc of epinephrine,

28:54.274 --> 28:56.609
instant cardiac arrest.

28:56.735 --> 28:57.985
Still, what the hell, it tastes great.

28:58.112 --> 28:59.529
Sister Augustine...

28:59.655 --> 29:02.698
Has been drinking it religiously,
so to speak.

29:02.825 --> 29:04.992
And if you take the cardiac arrest
out of the equation...

29:05.119 --> 29:06.619
All the rest of the symptoms
can be explained

29:06.745 --> 29:09.163
by a severe long-term
allergic reaction.

29:09.289 --> 29:11.541
Well, that's what Cameron said
in the beginning.

29:11.667 --> 29:14.919
Yes, she did. Well done.

29:16.171 --> 29:18.756
But your unwillingness to stick
by your diagnosis

29:18.882 --> 29:20.591
almost killed this woman.

29:20.717 --> 29:21.926
Take a lesson from Foreman.

29:22.052 --> 29:23.886
Stand up for what you believe.

29:24.763 --> 29:27.723
Okay. Let's go figure out
how to save a nun.

29:28.809 --> 29:31.436
Damned if you do, damned if you don't.

29:32.479 --> 29:34.147
Because it's been untreated
for so long,

29:34.273 --> 29:36.941
it's gone from a simple "watery eyes,
scratchy throat" allergy

29:37.067 --> 29:39.235
to a whopping "I'm gonna kick your ass"
allergy,

29:39.361 --> 29:41.946
compromising her immune system,
diminishing her ability to heal

29:42.072 --> 29:43.448
and breaking down her organ systems.

29:43.574 --> 29:44.866
So, what's the source?

29:44.992 --> 29:46.742
The dish soap.

29:46.869 --> 29:49.954
No. The symptoms persisted days
after the dish-washing episode.

29:50.080 --> 29:51.289
It's gotta be something
she's been exposed to

29:51.415 --> 29:53.207
here in the hospital
as well as the monastery.

29:53.333 --> 29:55.710
What about the tea?
It caused her arrhythmia.

29:55.836 --> 29:57.170
Could be, but it's not definitive.

29:57.296 --> 29:58.629
We'll skin-test for allergens.

29:58.755 --> 30:00.214
Not yet. She's too reactive.

30:00.340 --> 30:02.300
She tests positive to everything.
We need to stabilize her,

30:02.426 --> 30:05.303
isolate her from all possible
allergens, give her system a rest.

30:05.429 --> 30:06.429
Get her in a clean room.

30:06.555 --> 30:07.555
Okay.

30:07.681 --> 30:09.974
Then gradually introduce allergens
and see how she responds.

30:10.100 --> 30:13.769
When she reacts to something,
we'll know that's what's killing her.

30:14.480 --> 30:17.064
There you go. No television, no books.

30:17.191 --> 30:18.232
Not even my Bible?

30:18.358 --> 30:19.317
I'm afraid not.

30:19.443 --> 30:21.694
This room has filtered air,
filtered water.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.154
You even have silk sheets.

30:23.280 --> 30:25.239
Very decadent and hypoallergenic.

30:25.908 --> 30:28.451
You should be feeling better here.

30:31.830 --> 30:34.707
We'll be back to check on you
in a little while.

30:34.833 --> 30:37.877
Can the other sisters come in
and pray with me?

30:39.379 --> 30:42.089
It'd be better
if you don't have any visitors.

30:42.216 --> 30:44.091
Once we isolate
what's causing your allergy,

30:44.218 --> 30:46.761
then we can be a little more lax.

30:57.898 --> 30:59.690
I can pray with you.

31:00.817 --> 31:02.527
I don't wanna die.

31:03.779 --> 31:05.738
Why has He left me?

31:15.832 --> 31:17.833
I was in seminary school.

31:19.670 --> 31:22.213
They asked us once
what our favorite passage was.

31:22.339 --> 31:25.550
I chose First Peter,
chapter one, verse seven.

31:27.386 --> 31:29.971
"These trials only test your faith
to see whether or not

31:30.097 --> 31:31.764
"it is strong and pure."

31:31.890 --> 31:36.602
"Your faith is being tested,
as fire tests gold and purifies it."

31:36.728 --> 31:39.939
"And your faith is far more precious
to the Lord than mere gold."

31:40.065 --> 31:42.567
"So if your faith remains strong
after being tested,

31:42.693 --> 31:47.238
"it will bring you much praise
and glory and honor

31:48.907 --> 31:50.866
"on the day of his return."

31:51.743 --> 31:53.452
He hasn't left you.

31:56.957 --> 31:59.917
The only thing in the way of you
knowing He's there is your fear.

32:00.043 --> 32:02.878
You have a choice, faith or fear.

32:04.590 --> 32:05.715
That's the test.

32:05.841 --> 32:07.800
Choosing faith doesn't mean
I won't die.

32:07.926 --> 32:11.220
But it will affect
how you experience your death,

32:11.346 --> 32:14.724
and, therefore, your life.
It's up to you.

32:14.850 --> 32:17.393
Why did you leave seminary school?

32:19.479 --> 32:20.896
That test.

32:22.065 --> 32:24.817
You passed. I didn't.

32:26.320 --> 32:27.820
We'll call you if anything changes.

32:27.946 --> 32:29.363
Will she be all right?

32:29.573 --> 32:31.115
As long as she's not exposed
to anything

32:31.241 --> 32:33.534
that can aggravate her allergy,
she'll be fine.

32:34.745 --> 32:36.746
I need some help in here!

32:42.294 --> 32:44.337
Screw the procedure!
She's in anaphylactic shock!

32:44.463 --> 32:45.546
No way. She's in a damn clean room.

32:45.672 --> 32:46.672
You kidding me?

32:46.798 --> 32:48.090
Get in here!

32:50.135 --> 32:51.719
0.1 cc of epi.

32:51.845 --> 32:53.512
We've got to intubate.

32:53.639 --> 32:55.931
I got it. Get the ambu bag.

33:08.695 --> 33:09.779
I'm in.

33:22.668 --> 33:24.585
Breathing's stabilized.

33:26.463 --> 33:28.089
It's a clean room.

33:36.598 --> 33:39.809
How do you get an allergic
reaction in a clean room?

33:41.019 --> 33:43.104
Maybe it was the preservatives
in the IV.

33:43.230 --> 33:45.022
Checked that.

33:45.148 --> 33:46.107
Latex tubing?

33:46.233 --> 33:48.526
Checked that. Checked everything.

33:48.652 --> 33:50.820
Well, it could be mast cell leukemia.

33:50.946 --> 33:52.530
It can cause anaphylaxis.

33:52.656 --> 33:54.532
I checked the blood levels,

33:54.658 --> 33:58.786
and it's not eosinophilia
or idiopathic anaphylaxis.

33:58.912 --> 34:00.913
Maybe it's just divine will.

34:02.416 --> 34:03.999
It's not my will.

34:08.088 --> 34:11.298
You do realize, if you're wrong

34:11.425 --> 34:12.925
about the big picture, that is,

34:13.051 --> 34:14.885
you're going to burn, right?

34:15.011 --> 34:17.054
What do you want me to do,
just accept it, pack it in?

34:17.180 --> 34:18.764
Yeah. I want you to accept that

34:18.890 --> 34:20.891
sometimes patients die
against all reason,

34:21.017 --> 34:22.727
and sometimes they get better
against all reason.

34:22.853 --> 34:25.229
No, they don't.
We just don't know the reason.

34:25.355 --> 34:27.982
I think the nuns would agree with you
on that.

34:37.159 --> 34:38.701
I just wanted to say that

34:38.827 --> 34:40.077
I know that you did everything
you could.

34:40.203 --> 34:43.581
I don't need verification from you
to know that I'm doing my job well.

34:43.707 --> 34:45.166
That's your problem, not mine.

34:45.292 --> 34:46.667
I was just being nice.

34:46.793 --> 34:49.754
Yeah, well,
you don't need to always do that.

34:51.882 --> 34:53.632
Merry Christmas.

35:04.686 --> 35:07.062
Sister Augustine's been extubated.

35:08.690 --> 35:09.690
Good.

35:09.816 --> 35:12.485
She's requested to check out,
against medical advice.

35:12.611 --> 35:14.195
She wants to go back to the monastery.

35:14.321 --> 35:16.655
Well, talk her out of it.

35:17.616 --> 35:20.201
I think I may have talked her into it.

35:36.927 --> 35:39.094
Room's paid up
for the rest of the week.

35:40.722 --> 35:42.515
Might as well stick around.

35:42.641 --> 35:45.893
This illness is a test of my faith.

35:46.937 --> 35:51.482
If it's His will to take me,
it doesn't matter where I am.

35:51.608 --> 35:53.192
I can accept that.

35:54.027 --> 35:56.779
Does anybody believe anything you say?

35:58.365 --> 36:00.115
You're not accepting.

36:01.868 --> 36:03.702
You're running away.

36:03.829 --> 36:06.038
Just like you always do.

36:06.164 --> 36:09.083
You ran away from the monastery
to get laid.

36:10.210 --> 36:11.836
You ran away from the real world

36:11.962 --> 36:13.796
when getting laid
didn't work out so good.

36:14.130 --> 36:17.925
Now things aren't working out again,
so off you go.

36:18.051 --> 36:21.929
Why is it so difficult for you
to believe in God?

36:22.055 --> 36:26.267
What I have difficulty with is
the whole concept of belief.

36:26.393 --> 36:28.853
Faith isn't based on logic
and experience.

36:28.979 --> 36:32.815
I experience God on a daily basis

36:32.941 --> 36:35.401
and the miracle of life all around,

36:36.152 --> 36:39.947
the miracle of birth,
the miracle of love.

36:40.782 --> 36:42.825
He is always with me.

36:42.951 --> 36:47.705
Where is the miracle in delivering
a crack-addicted baby?

36:49.791 --> 36:53.544
Then watching her mother abandon her
'cause she needs another score?

36:53.670 --> 36:54.920
Miracle of love.

36:55.046 --> 36:58.257
You're over twice as likely
to be killed

36:58.383 --> 37:01.760
by the person you love
than by a stranger.

37:01.887 --> 37:04.597
Are you trying to talk me out of
my faith?

37:04.723 --> 37:08.642
You can have all the faith you want
in spirits and the afterlife,

37:08.768 --> 37:11.312
heaven and hell.

37:11.438 --> 37:15.190
But when it comes to this world,
don't be an idiot.

37:15.317 --> 37:17.359
'Cause you can tell me
that you put your faith in God

37:17.485 --> 37:18.944
to get you through the day,

37:19.070 --> 37:21.906
but when it comes time to cross
the road, I know you look both ways.

37:22.032 --> 37:26.702
I don't believe He is inside me
and is going to save me.

37:26.828 --> 37:31.457
I believe He is inside me
whether I live or die.

37:31.583 --> 37:33.792
Then you might as well live.

37:35.545 --> 37:38.047
You got a better shot
betting on me than on Him.

37:39.841 --> 37:41.300
When I was 15,

37:42.552 --> 37:46.931
I was on every kind of birth control
known to man

37:47.057 --> 37:49.099
and I still got pregnant.

37:50.518 --> 37:52.394
I blamed God.

37:52.520 --> 37:55.022
I hated Him for ruining my life.

37:55.482 --> 37:57.775
But then I realized something.

37:57.901 --> 38:03.238
You can't be angry with God and
not believe in Him at the same time.

38:03.365 --> 38:06.909
No one can. Not even you, Dr. House.

38:12.123 --> 38:13.666
How'd it go?

38:13.792 --> 38:15.709
She has God inside her.

38:16.169 --> 38:19.338
It would have been easier
to deal with a tumor.

38:19.464 --> 38:21.757
Maybe she's allergic to God.

38:26.763 --> 38:28.305
We've looked everywhere for an allergen

38:28.431 --> 38:29.723
that could be causing this reaction,

38:29.849 --> 38:31.433
except one place, inside her.

38:31.559 --> 38:33.602
On her medical history,
she didn't mention any surgery.

38:33.728 --> 38:34.770
She had one.

38:34.896 --> 38:36.480
Can we get her records?
What hospital was it at?

38:36.606 --> 38:38.524
She didn't have it at a hospital.

38:38.650 --> 38:39.984
Order a full body scan.

38:40.110 --> 38:41.568
What if she refuses?

38:41.695 --> 38:44.154
Tell her I'm looking for a miracle.

38:46.324 --> 38:49.201
No piercings. No fillings.

38:49.327 --> 38:52.788
No surgical pins in the arm.
No implants.

38:52.914 --> 38:54.581
It's clean as a whistle.

38:54.708 --> 38:56.208
What's House looking for?

38:58.044 --> 38:59.628
What is that?

38:59.796 --> 39:01.171
Don't know.

39:01.297 --> 39:03.841
Lock on it. Get a 3-D representation.

39:09.764 --> 39:11.056
Oh, my God.

39:14.686 --> 39:19.648
The copper cross, form of birth control
pulled off the market in the '80s.

39:19.774 --> 39:21.442
So she's allergic to copper.

39:21.818 --> 39:23.235
Rare, but it happens.

39:23.361 --> 39:25.195
Wouldn't she know she had an IUD?

39:25.321 --> 39:27.614
She had an abortion.
IUD must have been left in,

39:27.741 --> 39:30.909
embedded in the endometrial tissue
where it couldn't be detected.

39:31.494 --> 39:33.871
So, all we have to do is
remove the IUD.

39:33.997 --> 39:36.290
Then the symptoms
should subside.

39:36.416 --> 39:38.709
I got this IUD when I was 15.

39:38.960 --> 39:40.919
It's been more than 20 years.

39:41.046 --> 39:44.214
Prolonged exposure to an allergen
with minimal symptoms.

39:44.340 --> 39:46.884
But at some point,
all it takes is one last contact

39:47.010 --> 39:48.677
to cause a full-blown reaction.

39:48.803 --> 39:53.098
Just like a balloon filled with air,
one last breath, it explodes.

39:53.224 --> 39:56.894
The first time I got the rash was
when I was washing the copper cookware.

39:57.020 --> 40:01.565
And all your subsequent symptoms came
from ingesting food prepared in it.

40:01.775 --> 40:04.151
Dr. House found his miracle.

40:04.277 --> 40:06.195
I doubt he'll interpret it that way.

40:08.531 --> 40:10.824
You told me your favorite passage.

40:10.950 --> 40:13.160
Would you like to hear mine?

40:14.746 --> 40:16.789
"Celebrate and be glad,

40:16.915 --> 40:19.708
"because your brother was dead
and is alive again."

40:19.834 --> 40:21.627
The prodigal son.

40:23.129 --> 40:25.964
He'll be waiting for you
when you're ready.

40:28.134 --> 40:30.844
We'll schedule your surgery
for tomorrow.

40:37.477 --> 40:39.311
The sixth circle of hell.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.605
Confined in a sweat box
with a bloody nose,

40:41.731 --> 40:43.107
and all the tissues are soggy.

40:43.233 --> 40:44.316
I think that's the seventh.

40:44.442 --> 40:45.484
No. The seventh is...

40:45.610 --> 40:47.236
God, you must be fun at parties.

40:47.362 --> 40:49.488
I think we both know the flaw
in that theory.

40:49.614 --> 40:50.697
How's the sister?

40:50.824 --> 40:52.991
Heart rate is normal,
kidneys functioning.

40:53.118 --> 40:54.076
You know how it is with nuns.

40:54.202 --> 40:56.453
You take out their IUDs,
they just bounce right back.

40:56.579 --> 40:57.704
Great.

40:57.831 --> 40:58.872
Told you I didn't screw up.

41:00.583 --> 41:01.458
You screwed up.

41:01.584 --> 41:03.669
I gave her 0.1cc of epinephrine.

41:03.795 --> 41:07.381
Yeah, and if Cuddy hadn't taken you off
the case, you would have killed her.

41:08.883 --> 41:11.802
You wanna come over
for Christmas dinner?

41:11.928 --> 41:13.720
You're Jewish.

41:13.888 --> 41:15.472
Yeah. Hanukkah dinner.

41:15.598 --> 41:17.391
What do you care?
It's food. It's people.

41:17.517 --> 41:19.184
No, thanks.

41:20.478 --> 41:22.771
Maybe I'll come to your place.

41:22.897 --> 41:24.815
Your wife doesn't mind
being alone at Christmas?

41:24.941 --> 41:27.860
I'm a doctor.
She's used to being alone.

41:29.737 --> 41:32.197
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Neither do I.

41:36.202 --> 41:38.245
You did good with the nun.

41:38.830 --> 41:40.539
Congratulations.

41:41.624 --> 41:42.875
Thank you.

41:43.501 --> 41:46.795
Merry Christmas, Dr. House.
Dr. Wilson.

41:48.590 --> 41:49.840
Good night.

41:52.177 --> 41:53.844
That was sweet.
