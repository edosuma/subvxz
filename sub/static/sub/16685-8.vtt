- Ow!

37:18.704 --> 37:21.905
- Matt, we're home.

37:30.916 --> 37:32.382
- Well, that's not
what we hoped.

37:32.384 --> 37:35.785
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

37:35.787 --> 37:37.621
- I'm gonna go wake up
your mother.

37:46.765 --> 37:51.868
- God, what is that smell?
Is that salt?

37:51.870 --> 37:53.770
- Somebody salted our farm.

37:53.772 --> 37:55.272
- Every single plant
is uprooted.

37:55.274 --> 37:57.440
It's like they used a tractor.

37:57.442 --> 37:59.776
- We'll replant.
- It reeks of salt.

37:59.778 --> 38:01.945
Nothing's gonna
grow here for years.

38:01.947 --> 38:03.580
- Someone put a lot
of effort into this.

38:03.582 --> 38:06.383
- Yeah, like Feverheads.
- Who else has the energy?

38:06.385 --> 38:09.786
- [groans]
- I spent so much time

38:09.788 --> 38:13.356
trying to get away
from this place.

38:13.358 --> 38:15.458
I'm so sorry, Mom.
[crying]

38:15.460 --> 38:20.697
- My farm! My farm!

38:20.699 --> 38:22.499
- Get the shotgun.
- Happy to.

38:22.501 --> 38:25.468

38:28.607 --> 38:31.841
- [grunting, groaning]

38:31.843 --> 38:33.610
- Hey,
that's Rob Halderson.

38:33.612 --> 38:34.978
[shotgun cocks]

38:34.980 --> 38:37.414
And Corinne.
Forget the shotgun.

38:37.416 --> 38:40.850
Corinne.
- Karen, I'm so sorry.

38:40.852 --> 38:42.619
They burned our farm
four days ago.

38:42.621 --> 38:43.853
- Who? Who did?
- I don't know.

38:43.855 --> 38:45.722
I don't know.
We ran away.

38:45.724 --> 38:47.457
[Rob indistinctly screaming]

38:47.459 --> 38:48.992
Rob already had the blood
in his mouth...

38:48.994 --> 38:51.394
- Uh-huh.
- And when--when we came back

38:51.396 --> 38:53.496
he'd burned our house,
and killed all the cattle,

38:53.498 --> 38:55.131
and it was just--

38:55.132 --> 38:56.765
it was such a shock
that he went bad right away.

38:56.768 --> 38:59.669
- [screaming]

39:02.441 --> 39:03.940
- I'm sorry.
- He went bad right away.

39:03.942 --> 39:06.376
- Sorry.
- He kept saying,

39:06.378 --> 39:08.745
"I'm gonna get even with them.
I'm gonna get even with them."

39:08.747 --> 39:12.382
- Oh, so he did all this, huh?
- It's the fever.

39:12.384 --> 39:14.417
He would have killed me
if I tried to stop him.

39:14.419 --> 39:17.520
- Honey, he's gonna
kill you anyway.

39:17.522 --> 39:20.457
You know how to use this?

39:20.459 --> 39:23.927
[Rob grunting]
- Yes.

39:23.929 --> 39:26.696
- Take it.

39:26.698 --> 39:27.931
You're gonna need to.

39:27.933 --> 39:31.501
You be careful.

39:31.503 --> 39:35.739
Let's get out of here.
- What are you doing?

39:35.741 --> 39:37.941
- We're leaving?
- Yeah.

39:37.943 --> 39:39.609
Yeah we are.

39:42.948 --> 39:45.949
- Yeah, what are you, crazy?
That's our home.

39:45.951 --> 39:47.751
What's your plan?

39:47.753 --> 39:49.085
- I figure out that
I love this place,

39:49.087 --> 39:51.087
and you're taking it away?
- Look, I'm kind of

39:51.089 --> 39:54.758
a slow learner, but
when I get something I get it.

39:54.760 --> 39:57.560
Everything here belongs
to the past.

39:57.562 --> 39:58.995
It's not ours.

39:58.997 --> 40:00.964
- [screams]
- [whimpers]

40:00.966 --> 40:03.400
- The only thing we have
for ourselves is tomorrow.

40:04.669 --> 40:07.537
So that's
where we're gonna go.

40:07.539 --> 40:10.440
[Rob screaming]

40:12.177 --> 40:13.943
- Okay.

40:22.487 --> 40:25.054
- Saddle up.
- Yeah.

40:25.056 --> 40:29.459
Where we going?
- I don't know.

40:29.461 --> 40:32.429
You know...

40:32.431 --> 40:36.733
in the cave there
were drawings on the wall.

40:36.735 --> 40:39.068
Some of them looked like
they were our family,

40:39.070 --> 40:43.540
but there was one of--
like that Q bird--

40:43.542 --> 40:44.841
- Quetzalcoatl.
What was it doing?

40:44.843 --> 40:47.076
- It was--

40:47.078 --> 40:49.579
it was flying toward
a red sun.

40:49.581 --> 40:50.780
- Red sun.
That's a Chinese ideogram.

40:50.782 --> 40:53.683
Means dawn or east.

40:53.685 --> 40:55.218
- Okay.
- Which is interesting because

40:55.220 --> 40:57.554
during the eruption
Matt and Brianna--

40:57.556 --> 40:58.755
this Quetzalcoatl
landed near them

40:58.757 --> 41:00.924
and it was deliberately
facing to the east.

41:03.061 --> 41:05.562
Facing the east.

41:05.564 --> 41:08.531
- So maybe they're not demons?

41:08.533 --> 41:10.967
- They never attacked us.

41:10.969 --> 41:13.603
They've only
taken animals for food.

41:13.605 --> 41:17.173
- So maybe
they're working for us.

41:17.175 --> 41:19.609
- Harbingers?

41:19.611 --> 41:21.711
- You think it's sexy
when you use big words?

41:21.713 --> 41:23.580
- No, "harbinger" just--
- I know.
