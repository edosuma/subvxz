00:24.750 --> 00:27.420
# Love

00:27.540 --> 00:32.000
# Is a many splendoured thing

01:10.220 --> 01:12.670
I'm going back to Australia,
I won't see you again.

01:12.800 --> 01:14.790
Don't talk that way, Sandy.

01:14.930 --> 01:16.590
But it's true.

01:16.720 --> 01:21.720
I've had the best summer of my life.
Now I have to go away. It isn't fair.

01:30.870 --> 01:35.610
- Danny, don't spoil it.
- Sandy, it's only making it better.

01:35.750 --> 01:37.950
Danny, is this the end?

01:38.080 --> 01:39.740
Of course not.

01:41.380 --> 01:42.840
It's only the beginning.

01:43.300 --> 01:45.420
This is the main brain,
Vince Fontaine,

01:45.550 --> 01:48.120
beginning your day the only way.
Music, music.

01:48.260 --> 01:49.760
Get out of bed, first day of school.

01:49.890 --> 01:53.140
Don't be a slob, don't get a job,
go back to class, you can pass.

01:53.270 --> 01:57.100
To start the day off nice and fine,
here's a new old favourite of mine.

01:57.900 --> 02:00.850
# I solve my problems
and I see the light

02:00.980 --> 02:03.140
# We got a lovin' thing

02:03.280 --> 02:05.650
# We got to feed it right

02:06.530 --> 02:10.030
# There ain't no danger
we can go too far

02:10.160 --> 02:12.200
# We start believin' now

02:12.330 --> 02:14.410
# That we can be who we are

02:14.540 --> 02:16.580
# Grease is the word

02:20.090 --> 02:23.380
# They think our love
is just a growin' pain

02:23.510 --> 02:25.590
# Why don't they understand?

02:25.720 --> 02:28.390
# It's just a cryin' shame

02:28.850 --> 02:32.140
# Their lips are lying,
only real is real

02:32.270 --> 02:34.560
# We stop the fight right now

02:34.690 --> 02:36.650
# We got to be what we feel

02:36.780 --> 02:38.400
# Grease is the word

02:38.530 --> 02:41.150
# Is the word,
is the word that you've heard

02:41.280 --> 02:44.450
# It's got groove, it's got meaning

02:46.460 --> 02:50.830
# Grease is the time,
is the place, is the motion

02:50.960 --> 02:54.660
# Grease is the way we are feelin'

02:57.840 --> 03:01.010
# We take the pressure
and we throw away

03:01.140 --> 03:03.100
# Conventionality

03:03.480 --> 03:05.970
# Belongs to yesterday

03:06.730 --> 03:09.810
# There is a chance
that we can make it so far

03:09.940 --> 03:12.180
# We start believin' now

03:12.320 --> 03:14.480
# That we can be who we are

03:14.610 --> 03:15.940
# Grease is the word

03:16.070 --> 03:18.860
# Is the word,
is the word that you've heard

03:18.990 --> 03:22.000
# It's got groove, it's got meaning

03:24.290 --> 03:28.160
# Grease is the time,
is the place, is the motion

03:28.300 --> 03:32.430
# Now grease is the way
we are feelin'

03:33.510 --> 03:35.750
# This is a life of illusion

03:36.390 --> 03:38.600
# Wrapped up in troubles

03:38.730 --> 03:40.180
# Laced in confusion

03:40.310 --> 03:43.680
# What are we doing here?

03:44.360 --> 03:47.640
# We take the pressure
and we throw away

03:47.780 --> 03:49.850
# Conventionality

03:49.990 --> 03:52.450
# Belongs to yesterday

03:53.160 --> 03:56.610
# There is a chance
that we can make it so far

03:56.750 --> 03:58.700
# We start believin' now

03:58.830 --> 04:00.790
# That we can be who we are

04:01.250 --> 04:02.530
# Grease is the word

04:02.670 --> 04:05.590
# Is the word,
is the word that you've heard

04:05.720 --> 04:08.920
# It's got groove, it's got meaning

04:10.850 --> 04:15.390
# Grease is the time,
is the place, is the motion

04:15.520 --> 04:18.940
# Grease is the way we are feelin'

04:34.210 --> 04:37.910
# Grease is the word,
is the word that you've heard

04:38.050 --> 04:40.620
# It's got groove, it's got meaning

04:43.050 --> 04:47.100
# Grease is the time,
is the place, is the motion

04:47.220 --> 04:50.840
# Grease is the way we are feelin'

04:54.020 --> 04:58.020
# Grease is the word,
is the word, is the word

05:09.920 --> 05:13.250
- You don't eat this, you bury it.
- That's a home-made lunch.

05:13.380 --> 05:15.870
Your old lady drag her carcass
out of bed for you?

05:16.010 --> 05:19.130
- She does it first day of school.
- Big deal.

05:21.470 --> 05:24.050
- Kenickie. Over here.
- Where you at?

05:25.100 --> 05:26.850
We're right here.

05:26.980 --> 05:29.650
- Where were you all summer?
- Are you my mother?

05:29.770 --> 05:33.190
- Just askin'.
- Working. More than you can say.

05:33.320 --> 05:36.740
- Working?
- Yes, lugging boxes at Bargain City.

05:36.870 --> 05:39.240
- Nice job.
- Eat me.

05:39.370 --> 05:41.330
I'm saving up to get me some wheels.

05:41.450 --> 05:43.200
- Wanna hear what I did?
- No.

05:43.330 --> 05:45.540
Hey, there's Danny.

05:46.380 --> 05:48.420
Danny! Danny!

06:02.270 --> 06:04.350
You seen any new broads there?

06:04.480 --> 06:08.020
Nah, same old chicks,
everybody's made them.

06:08.150 --> 06:10.230
So what'd you do all summer?

06:10.360 --> 06:13.030
I was hanging around at the beach.
You know.

06:13.160 --> 06:16.080
It's tough with all those chicks
hanging around you.

06:16.200 --> 06:20.250
The only thing
that hangs around you are the flies.

06:20.380 --> 06:23.410
How was the action
at the beach, man?

06:23.710 --> 06:26.040
Whew. It was flipping.

06:26.170 --> 06:27.920
Yeah? Crazy?

06:28.050 --> 06:32.430
I did meet this one chick.
She was sorta cool.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.720
You mean she puts out?

06:34.850 --> 06:38.020
Come on, Sonny,
is that all you think about?

06:38.150 --> 06:40.850
- Freakin' A.
- (bell)

06:42.490 --> 06:44.110
Hey, guys, wait up.

06:44.240 --> 06:47.020
- Do I look OK, Frenchy?
- Sure, you look good.

06:47.160 --> 06:50.490
- I'm really nervous.
- You look terrific.

06:50.620 --> 06:54.530
- So, this is Rydell?
- Yep. You'll love it.

06:54.670 --> 06:58.500
I loved the last school I was at.
I wish I was there right now.

06:58.630 --> 07:01.120
Still, I'm no stranger to heartbreak.

07:01.260 --> 07:03.580
Why? You got psoriasis?

07:06.890 --> 07:08.380
(car backfires)

07:21.700 --> 07:23.740
Well, here we are again.

07:23.870 --> 07:27.780
- But this time we're seniors.
- We're gonna rule the school.

07:27.910 --> 07:29.790
(all laugh)

07:29.920 --> 07:31.740
Jan, that is so adolescent.

07:31.880 --> 07:35.410
- We are adolescent.
- We don't have to flaunt it.

07:35.550 --> 07:37.090
OK, girls.

07:37.220 --> 07:38.960
Let's go get 'em.

07:44.930 --> 07:47.180
Blanche, do you have
the new schedules?

07:47.310 --> 07:50.020
Yes, Miss McGee,
I just had my hands on them.

07:50.150 --> 07:53.020
Oh, good, they'll be
nice and smudged.

07:53.150 --> 07:56.900
Here we are. If it had been a snake,
it would've bitten me.

07:58.280 --> 08:01.620
These are the schedules
we couldn't find last semester.

08:01.750 --> 08:04.200
Next year,
you might find this semester's.

08:12.130 --> 08:16.080
- I've got Kenickie again.
- He's been here longer than I have.

08:16.220 --> 08:20.470
First day of school and already
my castor oil is missing.

08:21.440 --> 08:24.010
How many days
till Christmas vacation?

08:24.150 --> 08:25.260
86.

08:25.400 --> 08:27.360
- 86?
- And counting.

08:29.150 --> 08:31.560
- Can I help you?
- Yes, it's my first day.

08:31.700 --> 08:35.280
- I'm not sure where I should be.
- Welcome to Rydell.

08:35.409 --> 08:38.200
You'll have to fill out
these forms, but...

08:38.330 --> 08:41.000
Excuse me a minute.
I'll be right back.

08:42.840 --> 08:47.170
- Do you have a pencil, please?
- Yes, dear. There you are.

08:48.050 --> 08:49.550
(bell)

08:56.690 --> 09:00.440
Jeez. Every teacher I got this year
has flunked me at least once.

09:00.570 --> 09:03.020
You'll spend your time
in McGee's office.

09:03.150 --> 09:07.320
- She'll wish she'd never seen me.
- Yeah? And what are you gonna do?

09:07.450 --> 09:11.360
I just ain't gonna take her crap.
I don't take no crap from nobody.

09:11.500 --> 09:13.790
- Sonny?
- Oh, hello, ma'am.

09:13.920 --> 09:17.000
- Shouldn't you be in home room?
- I was going for a walk.

09:17.130 --> 09:19.290
- You were dawdling.
- Yes, ma'am.

09:19.420 --> 09:22.960
That is no way to start
a new semester, Mr LaTierri.

09:23.090 --> 09:24.500
(mutters in Italian)

09:24.640 --> 09:29.180
Perhaps a session of banging erasers
after school would put you on track.

09:29.310 --> 09:30.770
Yes, ma'am.

09:30.890 --> 09:34.730
- Do you plan to stand there all day?
- No, ma'am. I mean, yes.

09:34.860 --> 09:36.770
- Well, which is it?
- No, ma'am.

09:36.900 --> 09:39.140
- Good. Then move.
- Yes, ma'am.

09:41.740 --> 09:44.580
I'm glad you didn't take
any of her crap, Sonny.

09:44.700 --> 09:46.530
You would have told her off, huh?

09:46.660 --> 09:49.750
Mr LaTierri.
Yes, ma'am, no, ma'am...

09:49.870 --> 09:50.870
Hey, Eugene.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.990
How you doin'?

09:53.130 --> 09:55.370
- Shake, buddy.
- (buzzing)

09:55.920 --> 09:58.590
What's wrong?
You're wearing glasses.

09:58.720 --> 10:00.800
- I got an astigmatism.
- Too bad.

10:04.180 --> 10:08.100
(students) # As I go travelling down
life's highway

10:08.650 --> 10:13.270
# Whatever course my fortunes
may foretell...

10:14.450 --> 10:16.850
(chimes)

10:17.990 --> 10:21.690
Good morning, boys and girls.
Welcome to what we're sure will be

10:21.830 --> 10:23.950
our greatest year at Rydell.

10:24.080 --> 10:27.500
Saturday night will be
our first pep rally and bonfire.

10:27.630 --> 10:30.200
I want to see all of you students
out there,

10:30.340 --> 10:35.090
with plenty of support for Coach
Calhoun and the Rydell Rangers.

10:35.220 --> 10:39.380
If you can't be an athlete,
be an athletic supporter.

10:40.020 --> 10:42.340
And now for the really good news.

10:42.480 --> 10:44.470
One of the most exciting things

10:44.610 --> 10:47.310
to ever happen at Rydell High.

10:47.440 --> 10:50.230
National Bandstand television show

10:50.360 --> 10:54.830
has selected Rydell as
a representative American high school

10:54.950 --> 10:58.570
and will do a live broadcast
from our very own gym.

10:58.710 --> 11:00.330
(cheering)

11:00.460 --> 11:03.290
It is our chance
to show the entire nation

11:03.420 --> 11:06.090
what fine, bright, clean-cut,

11:06.220 --> 11:10.340
wholesome students
we have here at Rydell.

11:11.300 --> 11:12.630
(screams)

11:19.360 --> 11:20.900
# Ba, ba, bamba

11:21.020 --> 11:22.980
# Ba, ba, bamba

11:24.070 --> 11:25.900
# La, la, la, la, la bamba

11:27.620 --> 11:30.490
Did you guys get a look
at Zuko this mornin'?

11:31.160 --> 11:33.740
Lookin' pretty good this year,
huh, Rizz?

11:33.870 --> 11:38.120
- That's ancient history.
- History sometimes repeats itself.

11:38.250 --> 11:40.710
- Hey, you guys.
- Hi, Frenchy.

11:40.840 --> 11:44.880
Go sit down.
This here is Sandy Olsen.

11:45.010 --> 11:47.970
And that's Jan and Marty,
and this is Rizzo.

11:48.100 --> 11:50.930
She just moved here
from Sydney, Australia.

11:51.390 --> 11:55.090
- How are things down under?
- Oh, fine, thanks.

11:57.230 --> 11:58.980
Marty, are those new glasses?

11:59.110 --> 12:02.110
Yeah, just for school.
Do they make me look smarter?

12:02.240 --> 12:04.400
Nah, you can still see your face.

12:04.530 --> 12:08.030
- How d'you like school, Sandy?
- It's different.

12:08.160 --> 12:10.660
- Hi, kids.
- (all groan)

12:10.790 --> 12:13.540
Patty Simcox,
the bad seed of Rydell. Hi.

12:13.670 --> 12:17.040
- I love the first day of school.
- The biggest thrill of my life.

12:17.170 --> 12:19.880
- You won't guess what's happened.
- Probably not.

12:20.010 --> 12:22.170
The nominees for Student Council
are out.

12:22.300 --> 12:24.590
- Guess who's up for Vice President?
- Who?

12:24.720 --> 12:26.470
Me. Isn't that the most?

12:26.600 --> 12:28.590
- To say the least.
- The very least.

12:28.730 --> 12:30.690
I hope I don't make a poor showing.

12:30.820 --> 12:33.690
We wish you the best of luck,
don't we, girls?

12:33.820 --> 12:35.560
I've got my fingers crossed.

12:36.740 --> 12:40.570
Oh, you must think I'm a clod
for not introducing myself.

12:40.700 --> 12:43.070
Hi, I'm Patty Simcox.

12:43.250 --> 12:45.370
Welcome to Rydell. (squeals)

12:50.000 --> 12:54.170
Will you be at cheerleader tryouts?
We'll be lifelong friends.

12:54.300 --> 12:56.840
You guys, how do you like Sandy?

12:56.970 --> 12:59.550
Do you think we can
let her in the Pink Ladies?

13:00.850 --> 13:04.220
- She looks too pure to be pink.
- Ohh, double do-do!

13:04.350 --> 13:05.470
What's up, doc?

13:05.610 --> 13:08.310
One of my diamonds
just fell in the macaroni.

13:10.030 --> 13:12.270
Kenickie, want a piece of salami?

13:12.410 --> 13:15.030
Are you kidding?
If I eat that, I'll smell like you.

13:15.160 --> 13:16.780
What a stink!

13:16.910 --> 13:18.490
Hey, guys, look.

13:20.370 --> 13:23.830
Ladies and gentlemen,
dingleberries on parade.

13:25.710 --> 13:29.300
Look! You really put
your foot into it this time.

13:29.430 --> 13:32.000
Try hopscotch, you hot dog.

13:32.970 --> 13:35.970
What a gavone! Gumdrops, man.

13:39.440 --> 13:42.640
Any of you guys see
that new chick in registration?

13:42.780 --> 13:44.850
Sure beats
the foam domes round here.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.610
Jugs bigger than Annette's?

13:46.740 --> 13:50.030
Nobody's jugs
are bigger than Annette's.

13:54.870 --> 13:57.000
Hey, guys. Hey!

14:00.300 --> 14:01.920
Hi, girls.

14:02.380 --> 14:04.210
You're a sick man, Putz.

14:07.600 --> 14:10.680
Hey, I wanna hear about
what Danny did at the beach.

14:11.350 --> 14:14.850
- It was nothing.
- Sure, nothing, Zuko. Right?

14:14.980 --> 14:18.070
- You got in her drawers, right?
- Come on, tell us.

14:18.190 --> 14:19.650
What did you do this summer?

14:19.780 --> 14:23.060
I spent most of it at the beach.
I met a boy there.

14:23.200 --> 14:25.900
You hauled your cookies
to the beach for a guy?

14:26.040 --> 14:29.410
- He was sorta special.
- There ain't no such thing.

14:30.750 --> 14:32.210
It was really romantic.

14:32.330 --> 14:34.660
Everything about it.

14:34.800 --> 14:37.710
You don't want to hear
the horny details.

14:37.840 --> 14:39.470
Alright, I'll tell you.

14:39.930 --> 14:43.630
# Summer lovin', had me a blast

14:43.770 --> 14:47.550
# Summer lovin', happened so fast

14:47.690 --> 14:51.060
# I met a girl, crazy for me

14:51.610 --> 14:54.480
# Met a boy, cute as can be

14:55.360 --> 14:58.650
# Summer days, drifting away

14:58.780 --> 15:01.020
# To uh, oh, those summer nights

15:01.160 --> 15:03.200
# Wella, wella, wella, huh

15:03.330 --> 15:06.910
# Tell me more, tell me more
Did you get very far?

15:07.040 --> 15:10.710
- # Tell me more, tell me more
- # Like does he have a car?

15:10.840 --> 15:14.420
- # Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
- # Do-do, do-do, do-do-do-do

15:14.550 --> 15:18.470
# She swam by me, she got a cramp

15:18.600 --> 15:22.010
# He ran by me, got my suit damp

15:22.560 --> 15:26.180
# I saved her life,
she nearly drowned

15:26.310 --> 15:29.650
# He showed off, splashing around

15:30.280 --> 15:33.150
# Summer sun, something's begun

15:33.280 --> 15:35.860
# But uh, oh, those summer nights

15:35.990 --> 15:37.650
# Wella, wella, wella, huh

15:37.790 --> 15:41.790
- # Tell me more, tell me more
- # Was it love at first sight?

15:41.920 --> 15:45.670
- # Tell me more, tell me more
- # Did she put up a fight?

15:45.800 --> 15:49.460
# Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
# Doobie-doo, doobie-doo, doobie-dum

15:49.590 --> 15:53.840
# Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
# Doobie-doo, doobie-doo, doobie-dum

15:53.970 --> 15:57.310
# Took her bowling in the arcade

15:57.440 --> 16:01.270
# We went strolling, drank lemonade

16:01.400 --> 16:04.770
# We made out, under the dock

16:04.900 --> 16:08.320
# We stayed out till ten o'clock

16:09.200 --> 16:12.620
# Summer fling, don't mean a thing

16:12.750 --> 16:16.250
# But uh, oh, those summer nights

16:17.000 --> 16:20.620
- # Tell me more, tell me more
- # But you don't gotta brag

16:20.750 --> 16:22.630
# Tell me more, tell me more

16:22.760 --> 16:24.580
# Cos he sounds like a drag

16:25.260 --> 16:29.170
# Shuda-bop-bop, shuda-bop-bop
Shuda-bop-bop, shuda-bop-bop

16:29.310 --> 16:32.890
# Shuda-bop-bop, shuda-bop-bop
Shuda-bop-bop, yeah!

16:33.600 --> 16:36.940
# He got friendly, holding my hand

16:37.070 --> 16:41.190
# She got friendly, down in sand

16:41.320 --> 16:44.860
# He was sweet, just turned 1 8

16:44.990 --> 16:48.160
# Well, she was good,
you know what I mean

16:49.040 --> 16:51.910
# Summer heat, boy and girl meet

16:52.040 --> 16:54.960
# But uh, oh, those summer nights

16:55.090 --> 16:56.750
# Whoa, whoa, whoa

16:56.880 --> 17:00.550
- # Tell me more, tell me more
- # How much dough did he spend?

17:00.680 --> 17:04.839
- # Tell me more, tell me more
- # Could she get me a friend?

17:07.810 --> 17:12.140
# It turned colder,
that's where it ends

17:12.770 --> 17:17.349
# So I told her we'd still be friends

17:18.030 --> 17:23.410
# Then we made our true love vow

17:24.710 --> 17:30.710
# Wonder what she's doing now

17:32.420 --> 17:35.710
# Summer dreams

17:35.840 --> 17:40.090
# Ripped at the seams

17:41.060 --> 17:43.220
# But

17:43.350 --> 17:45.140
# Oh

17:46.480 --> 17:50.310
# Those summer

17:51.400 --> 17:54.900
# Nights

17:55.620 --> 18:00.740
# Tell me more, tell me more

18:09.130 --> 18:11.090
He sounds real nice.

18:11.220 --> 18:14.640
True love and he didn't lay
a hand on you? Sounds like a creep.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.140
He wasn't. He was a gentleman.

18:17.270 --> 18:18.890
What was his name?

18:19.020 --> 18:20.850
Danny. Danny Zuko.

18:20.980 --> 18:22.390
(all giggle)

18:22.570 --> 18:25.440
Well, I think he sounds peachy keen.

18:26.450 --> 18:28.900
Maybe, if you believe in miracles,

18:29.030 --> 18:31.740
Prince Charming will show up again
someday.

18:31.870 --> 18:33.700
Somewhere unexpected.

18:33.830 --> 18:36.500
See you later. Come on, girls.

18:38.960 --> 18:42.050
- Do you really think so, Frenchy?
- Sure.

18:43.760 --> 18:46.680
Erm, ... Sandy, I think
we oughta get to class.

19:08.160 --> 19:10.040
(all) Do the splits, give a yell

19:10.160 --> 19:12.070
Show a little spirit for old Rydell

19:12.210 --> 19:14.370
Way to go, red and white

19:14.500 --> 19:16.960
Go Rydell, fight, fight, fight!

19:18.170 --> 19:21.260
(fanfare)

19:25.060 --> 19:26.880
And now...

19:27.520 --> 19:29.810
Quiet, please.

19:32.650 --> 19:36.810
Quiet, everyone. Now, boys and girls,
the man of the hour.

19:36.950 --> 19:38.770
The coach we're all depending on

19:38.910 --> 19:42.440
to pull Rydell out of
a seven-season slump,

19:42.580 --> 19:45.370
our very own Coach Calhoun.

19:45.500 --> 19:47.330
(cheering)

19:55.090 --> 19:57.760
- Who's the best?
- (all) Rydell!

20:00.390 --> 20:02.470
Give 'em hell, Rydell!

20:04.560 --> 20:09.270
I just wanna tell you students
that we have a banner year coming up.

20:09.400 --> 20:12.520
Because my boys are primed,
really primed,

20:12.660 --> 20:15.530
because I primed 'em.

20:15.660 --> 20:19.660
Not only primed, they're honed.
Honed to a sharp razor-edge.

20:20.540 --> 20:22.780
We're not just going out there
to win.

20:22.920 --> 20:26.960
We're going out there for glory.
And when we get out there,

20:27.090 --> 20:29.630
we're gonna yank 'em and tear 'em

20:29.760 --> 20:31.550
and rip 'em.

20:31.680 --> 20:36.340
We'll take 'em and roll 'em around
and rip 'em up to pieces!

20:36.470 --> 20:38.680
Then we're gonna slaughter 'em.

20:39.520 --> 20:41.760
And after the slaughter is over,

20:41.900 --> 20:45.270
we're gonna come back here
and ring that victory bell.

20:48.780 --> 20:50.740
Like we always wanted to.

21:13.520 --> 21:14.680
Watch this.

21:14.810 --> 21:17.770
Nyik-nyak, nyik-nyak
Brrr, nyik-nyak

21:17.900 --> 21:20.770
Do a split, give a yell
Shake a tit for old Rydell!

21:25.070 --> 21:26.620
Guys.

21:26.740 --> 21:28.200
Be cool, huh?

21:31.250 --> 21:33.080
Hey, watch out, pinhead!

21:37.710 --> 21:39.750
Well, what do you think?

21:39.880 --> 21:41.840
What a hunk of junk.

21:42.800 --> 21:45.640
Wait till I give it a paint job,
soup up the engine.

21:45.770 --> 21:49.020
She'll run like a champ.
I'm racing her at Thunder Road.

21:49.140 --> 21:52.060
- Thunder Road?
- Yeah. Wanna make something of it?

21:52.190 --> 21:55.610
I wanna see you
make something of this heap.

21:55.730 --> 21:57.780
You're cruisin' for a bruisin'.

21:57.900 --> 22:00.580
What are Scorpions doing here?
It ain't their turf.

22:04.290 --> 22:07.700
- Think they wanna rumble?
- If they do, we'll be ready.

22:15.760 --> 22:18.550
Alright, gang. Let's go get 'em!

22:27.360 --> 22:29.180
- Hey, chicken.
- Whoo-hoo!

22:29.320 --> 22:31.060
What you doing?

22:32.150 --> 22:34.820
- Thanks, Frenchy.
- That's alright.

22:34.950 --> 22:39.080
- You were great out there.
- I messed up, I was so nervous.

22:39.200 --> 22:41.910
- Your split was divoon.
- Hi, Sandy.

22:42.040 --> 22:44.960
- Hi, Rizz. Hi, girls.
- We got a surprise for you.

22:45.090 --> 22:46.460
- What is it?
- You'll see.

22:46.590 --> 22:47.700
Right, Rizz?

22:47.840 --> 22:49.420
Let me comb your hair down.

22:49.550 --> 22:51.510
Where are we going?

22:51.640 --> 22:53.380
Want a little lipstick?

22:54.510 --> 22:57.760
If you fix up this car,
it could be make-out city.

22:57.890 --> 23:01.260
A chick is gonna have to put out
before she even gets in.

23:01.400 --> 23:02.770
You'd better believe it.

23:02.900 --> 23:05.900
Hey, Zuko. I got a surprise for you.

23:06.030 --> 23:07.770
Oh, yeah?

23:08.450 --> 23:10.240
Yeah.

23:11.580 --> 23:14.150
- Sandy!
- Danny?

23:14.290 --> 23:17.990
What are you doing here?
I thought you were back in Australia.

23:18.120 --> 23:19.700
We had a change of plan.

23:20.420 --> 23:21.530
I can't...

23:23.880 --> 23:28.430
That's cool, baby. You know how it
is. Rockin' and rollin' and whatnot.

23:28.550 --> 23:31.180
- Danny?
- That's my name, don't wear it out.

23:31.310 --> 23:34.560
- What's the matter with you?
- What's the matter with me?

23:34.690 --> 23:36.760
What's the matter with you?

23:38.150 --> 23:41.270
What happened to the Danny Zuko
I met at the beach?

23:41.400 --> 23:45.730
Well, I do not know.
Maybe there's two of us, right?

23:46.700 --> 23:50.450
Why don't you take out
a missing-persons ad or...

23:50.580 --> 23:52.870
...try the Yellow Pages?
I don't know.

23:53.790 --> 23:57.840
You're a fake and a phoney.
I wish I'd never laid eyes on you.

23:57.960 --> 23:59.960
(all) Ooohhh...

24:00.680 --> 24:03.130
I wonder if she carries
silver bullets!

24:05.180 --> 24:08.050
So she laid her eyes on you,
huh, Zuko?

24:09.980 --> 24:12.350
I bet that's not all
she's laid on him.

24:12.480 --> 24:16.100
- Hey, Zuke! I got a car, remember?
- Come on, Danny.

24:16.240 --> 24:19.740
- Who's got beer money?
- I swiped my brother's ID.

24:24.790 --> 24:27.460
He was so nice to me this summer.

24:27.580 --> 24:30.620
Listen, Sandy, men are rats.

24:32.090 --> 24:35.670
Listen to me.
They're fleas on rats.

24:36.260 --> 24:39.710
Worse than that,
they're amoebas on fleas on rats.

24:39.850 --> 24:43.510
I mean, they're too low
for even the dogs to bite.

24:45.230 --> 24:48.100
The only man a girl can depend on
is her daddy.

24:49.900 --> 24:53.480
You know what you need?
A night out with the girls.

24:55.030 --> 24:59.160
We're having a sleep-over
at my house tonight. Wanna come?

24:59.290 --> 25:02.290
Good. You'll love it. Come on.

25:04.380 --> 25:05.710
Hey, look at Jan.

25:05.840 --> 25:08.750
# Brush-a, brush-a, brush-a
Get the new Ipana

25:08.880 --> 25:11.970
# With the brand-new flavour
It's dandy for your teeth

25:12.090 --> 25:15.340
# Brush-a, brush-a, brush-a,
New Ipana toothpaste

25:15.470 --> 25:19.600
# Brush-a, brush-a, brush-a
Knocks out decay germs fast

25:19.730 --> 25:21.890
# Fast, fast, you sure are right

25:22.770 --> 25:24.400
Turn it off.

25:25.900 --> 25:28.140
- Hand me a ciggie butt.
- Yeah, me, too.

25:28.280 --> 25:30.360
- Want one, Sandy?
- I don't smoke.

25:30.490 --> 25:34.190
- You don't?
- Go ahead, try it. It won't kill ya.

25:39.670 --> 25:43.800
Oh, I forgot to say, you shouldn't
inhale unless you're used to it.

25:44.260 --> 25:48.170
Sandy, let me teach you how to
French inhale. It's really cool.

25:51.560 --> 25:55.340
God. That is
the ugliest-Iooking thing I ever saw.

25:56.150 --> 25:59.480
The guys really go for it.
It's how I got my nickname.

25:59.610 --> 26:01.320
Sure it is.

26:04.070 --> 26:07.770
OK, how about a little Sneaky Pete
to get the party goin'?

26:09.290 --> 26:12.120
Italian Swiss Colony?
Wow, it's imported.

26:12.250 --> 26:14.450
I brought Twinkies.
Anybody want one?

26:14.580 --> 26:17.500
Twinkies and wine?
That's real class, Jan.

26:17.630 --> 26:20.710
It says right here
it is a dessert wine.

26:20.840 --> 26:23.420
Hey, Sandy didn't get any wine.

26:23.550 --> 26:27.170
- Oh, that's OK.
- I bet you never had a drink before.

26:27.310 --> 26:30.430
I had champagne
at my cousin's wedding once.

26:30.560 --> 26:31.970
Ring-a-ding-ding!

26:32.110 --> 26:34.260
What's wrong? We don't got cooties.

26:37.530 --> 26:41.030
Hey, Sandy. Would you like me
to pierce your ears for ya?

26:41.160 --> 26:44.490
- (jeering)
- Shut up!

26:46.620 --> 26:48.330
Isn't it awfully dangerous?

26:48.460 --> 26:51.500
I know what I'm doing.
I'm going to be a beautician.

26:51.630 --> 26:54.330
- What's the matter? You afraid?
- No, I'm not.

26:54.470 --> 26:58.300
- Here, Frenchy, use my virgin pin.
- It's good for somethin'.

26:59.350 --> 27:01.590
- It's not a good idea.
- It's OK.

27:01.720 --> 27:04.300
My father won't like it. (screams)

27:05.600 --> 27:07.850
Sandy, let's go into the bathroom.

27:07.980 --> 27:10.900
My mother'll kill me
if I get blood on the carpet.

27:11.030 --> 27:14.400
- It only bleeds for a second.
- I don't feel very well.

27:14.530 --> 27:16.520
Don't worry. If she screws up,

27:16.660 --> 27:19.690
she can fix your hair
so your ears don't show.

27:21.250 --> 27:24.170
Sandy, Sandy, beauty is pain.

27:24.290 --> 27:25.790
(screams)

27:25.920 --> 27:28.330
Could you get some ice
to numb her ears?

27:29.010 --> 27:32.460
Let the cold water run
and stick her ear under the faucet.

27:39.390 --> 27:41.970
Personally,
I'm getting rather chilly.

27:42.100 --> 27:44.980
- Hey, what's that?
- From Bobby in Korea.

27:45.110 --> 27:48.310
- Are you going with a Korean?
- Dummy, he's a marine.

27:48.450 --> 27:50.820
A marine? Whooo!

27:51.280 --> 27:52.440
Wanna see a picture?

27:54.200 --> 27:56.870
God. You're turning into
a one-woman USO.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.870
Hey, you guys, Sandy's sick.

28:01.000 --> 28:04.210
I just did one ear.
She saw the blood and... bleurgh!

28:05.130 --> 28:07.290
You won't get your hands on my ears.

28:07.430 --> 28:12.090
Yeah? You'll be sorry. I have been
accepted to La Cafury Beauty School.

28:12.220 --> 28:14.300
You're dropping out of Rydell?

28:14.430 --> 28:19.230
I don't see it as dropping out. I see
it as a very strategic career move.

28:19.360 --> 28:22.940
- Why's it torn in half?
- His old girlfriend was in it.

28:27.030 --> 28:30.450
Er, ... Sandy,
here's your toothbrush.

28:31.830 --> 28:34.870
Thanks, Frenchy.
I'm sorry to be so much trouble.

28:35.960 --> 28:37.790
It's OK.

28:39.260 --> 28:41.930
Miss Goody Two-Shoes
makes me wanna barf.

28:42.590 --> 28:46.430
# Look at me, I'm Sandra Dee

28:46.560 --> 28:50.260
# Lousy with virginity

28:50.390 --> 28:54.010
# Won't go to bed
Till I'm legally wed

28:54.150 --> 28:57.150
# I can't, I'm Sandra Dee

28:58.570 --> 28:59.570
Watch it.

28:59.700 --> 29:01.860
# Hey, I'm Doris Day

29:01.990 --> 29:05.820
# I was not brought up that way

29:05.950 --> 29:09.210
# Won't come across
Even Rock Hudson lost

29:09.330 --> 29:14.380
# His heart to Doris Day

29:14.510 --> 29:16.080
- # I don't drink
- No!

29:16.220 --> 29:17.710
- # Or swear
- Oh!

29:17.840 --> 29:19.670
- # I don't rat my hair
- Yeurgh!

29:19.800 --> 29:22.810
# I get ill from one cigarette
(coughs)

29:22.930 --> 29:27.100
# Keep your filthy paws
Off my silky drawers

29:27.230 --> 29:29.900
# Would you pull that crap
with Annette?

29:32.780 --> 29:36.360
# As for you, Troy Donahue

29:37.240 --> 29:39.570
# I know what you wanna do

29:40.370 --> 29:43.790
# You've got your crust
I'm no object of lust

29:43.920 --> 29:47.200
# I'm just plain Sandra Dee

29:48.630 --> 29:50.590
# Elvis! Elvis!

29:50.720 --> 29:52.760
# Let me be

29:52.880 --> 29:55.670
# Keep that pelvis far from me

29:55.810 --> 30:00.550
# Just keep your cool
Now you're starting to drool

30:01.400 --> 30:03.720
# Hey, fongool

30:04.650 --> 30:06.390
# I'm Sandra Dee

30:12.700 --> 30:14.080
Making fun of me, Rizz?

30:16.870 --> 30:18.780
Some people are so touchy.

30:29.390 --> 30:32.890
- # Later on they start to scratch...
- Shut up, you vultures.

30:33.020 --> 30:34.680
I changed my mind. Let's go.

30:34.810 --> 30:37.100
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

30:37.230 --> 30:38.850
(squealing)

30:39.900 --> 30:44.280
- They can't come. My folks'll flip.
- Putzie, you call her.

30:44.400 --> 30:47.610
Oh, Sandy.
Wherefore art thou, Sandy?

30:47.740 --> 30:49.320
Shut up! Sit down.

30:51.080 --> 30:53.120
You goody-goodies are too much.

30:53.250 --> 30:57.410
I'm gonna get my kicks while
I'm still young enough to get 'em.

30:57.550 --> 30:59.870
Is she gonna
shinny down the drainpipe?

31:00.010 --> 31:02.050
Hey, look. There's Rizzo.

31:02.180 --> 31:04.580
You're doing that without a net.

31:12.560 --> 31:14.600
Swell bunch, rushing to help a lady.

31:14.730 --> 31:17.440
- Lady? I don't see a lady.
- Shut up. Shut up!

31:17.570 --> 31:20.740
- What's up, Kenick?
- One guess.

31:20.860 --> 31:24.610
- You got a lot to offer a girl.
- Yeah, you know it.

31:25.490 --> 31:29.740
- What say you, Zuke?
- You're lookin' good, Rizz.

31:30.500 --> 31:33.620
- Eat your heart out.
- Sloppy seconds ain't my style.

31:40.140 --> 31:41.880
You going to flog your log?

31:44.060 --> 31:47.590
It's better than hanging around
with you dorks.

31:48.360 --> 31:50.890
Your chariot, my lady.

32:02.620 --> 32:04.860
I don't know what I saw
in Danny Zuko.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.570
Don't sweat it, honey.
Have one of mine.

32:09.380 --> 32:11.540
- There's so many of them.
- I know.

32:11.670 --> 32:14.800
- How do you keep up with them?
- I'm a terrific pen pal.

32:14.930 --> 32:17.140
Hopelessly devoted to every one.

32:25.690 --> 32:27.320
What are you doing?

32:27.440 --> 32:30.360
OK. What do you think this is?
A gangbang?

32:30.490 --> 32:32.360
- You wish.
- (all laugh)

32:33.070 --> 32:34.650
Hit the pavement.

32:34.790 --> 32:36.200
You gotta be kidding.

32:36.330 --> 32:38.400
- I said now.
- Alright.

32:38.540 --> 32:40.280
Remember us in your will.

32:46.010 --> 32:49.920
When a guy picks a chick
over his buddies, something's wrong.

32:50.600 --> 32:53.270
Come on, guys,
let's go for a slice of pizza.

32:55.390 --> 32:57.640
Can I have some of that?

32:57.770 --> 32:59.850
Sure.

32:59.980 --> 33:02.140
- Thanks.
- Wait.

33:09.030 --> 33:10.410
(door closes)

33:22.170 --> 33:28.100
# Guess mine is not
the first heart broken

33:28.770 --> 33:34.140
# My eyes are not the first
to cry

33:35.730 --> 33:38.520
# I'm not the first to know

33:38.650 --> 33:43.530
# There's just no getting over you

33:48.580 --> 33:54.170
# You know,
I'm just a fool who's willing

33:55.050 --> 34:00.210
# To sit around and wait for you

34:01.510 --> 34:04.180
# But, baby, can't you see?

34:04.850 --> 34:09.600
# There's nothing else for me to do

34:11.190 --> 34:16.480
# I'm hopelessly devoted to you

34:18.620 --> 34:23.909
# But now there's nowhere to hide

34:24.040 --> 34:27.239
# Since you pushed my love aside

34:27.380 --> 34:30.790
# I'm out of my head

34:30.920 --> 34:36.679
# Hopelessly devoted to you

34:37.469 --> 34:43.590
# Hopelessly devoted to you

34:47.190 --> 34:53.070
# Hopelessly devoted to you

34:56.870 --> 34:59.160
# My head is saying

34:59.290 --> 35:03.340
# Fool, forget him

35:03.460 --> 35:05.500
# My heart is saying

35:05.630 --> 35:09.050
# Don't let go

35:10.090 --> 35:13.550
# Hold on to the end

35:13.680 --> 35:18.010
# And that's what I intend to do

35:19.730 --> 35:25.520
# I'm hopelessly devoted to you

35:27.240 --> 35:32.320
# But now there's nowhere to hide

35:32.460 --> 35:35.660
# Since you pushed my love aside

35:35.790 --> 35:39.490
# I'm out of my head

35:39.630 --> 35:45.140
# Hopelessly devoted to you

35:46.010 --> 35:51.800
# Hopelessly devoted to you

35:55.730 --> 36:02.450
# Hopelessly devoted to you

36:11.460 --> 36:13.500
(radio) Is acne ruining your life?

36:13.630 --> 36:17.160
Do you close your eyes when you
look in the mirror? Fear no more.

36:17.300 --> 36:21.550
Face up to Face-Off, for deep
penetration into infected pores.

36:21.680 --> 36:24.720
Help dry up unsightly pimples
and blemishes...

36:25.980 --> 36:27.890
(grunts)

36:40.330 --> 36:43.740
- Rizz. Rizz.
- Could you call me by my first name?

36:43.870 --> 36:45.750
Oh, erm...

36:45.880 --> 36:46.990
Betty.

36:47.130 --> 36:48.750
Betty. Betty.

36:55.890 --> 36:59.220
- Have you got something?
- Are you kidding?

37:06.860 --> 37:08.900
My 25-cent insurance policy.

37:09.030 --> 37:10.850
Big spender.

37:14.450 --> 37:16.690
- What?
- It broke.

37:16.830 --> 37:18.990
How could it break?

37:19.540 --> 37:21.910
I bought it
when I was in seventh grade.

37:25.510 --> 37:27.130
Ohhh...

37:38.940 --> 37:40.850
What the hell?

37:45.200 --> 37:46.940
(crash)

37:48.450 --> 37:52.030
- What the hell are you doin'?
- It's a no-parking zone, creep.

37:53.330 --> 37:56.250
The whole place is a no-parking zone,
crater-face.

37:56.380 --> 37:58.420
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

38:01.170 --> 38:02.630
(crash)

38:03.260 --> 38:04.750
You're gonna pay for that.

38:05.340 --> 38:09.010
I'll give you 75 cents for
the whole car, including your chick.

38:19.440 --> 38:21.520
We just have to bang out the dent.

38:21.650 --> 38:25.440
The problem's not in the dent,
it's this rubber-band engine.

38:25.580 --> 38:29.280
- The problem's your mouth.
- Where you gonna get a carburettor?

38:29.410 --> 38:33.790
- Ever heard of borrowing?
- Kenickie, you got any Scotch tape?

38:33.920 --> 38:36.710
Hey, big stuff.
What do you drive, huh?

38:36.840 --> 38:39.000
- I drive.
- Yeah? How about you?

38:39.130 --> 38:40.760
- Who, me?
- Yeah.

38:40.890 --> 38:42.710
What about Doody?

38:42.850 --> 38:45.470
- Well, I...
- That's what I thought.

38:45.600 --> 38:51.470
C'mon, guys. This car could be
a major piece of machinery. Look.

38:52.860 --> 38:55.150
This car could be systematic.

38:56.660 --> 38:58.480
Hydromatic.

38:59.160 --> 39:00.780
Ultramatic.

39:02.290 --> 39:05.490
It could be Greased Lightning.

39:05.620 --> 39:09.460
# You get some overhead lifters
and four-barrel quads, oh, yeah

39:09.590 --> 39:11.880
# Keep talking, whoa, keep talking

39:12.010 --> 39:15.040
# With fuel-injection cut-off
and chrome-plated rods, oh, yeah

39:15.180 --> 39:17.750
# We'll get her ready
We'll get her ready

39:17.890 --> 39:20.890
# With a four-speed on the floor
They'll be waiting at the door

39:21.020 --> 39:23.640
# You know that ain't no shit
We'll be getting lots of tit

39:23.770 --> 39:25.600
- # In Greased Lightning
- # Go, go, go

39:25.730 --> 39:27.060
# Go-go-go-go

39:27.190 --> 39:30.440
# Go, Greased Lightning,
you're burning up the quarter mile

39:30.570 --> 39:32.860
# Greased Lightning
Go, Greased Lightning

39:32.990 --> 39:36.660
# Go, Greased Lightning, you're
coasting through the heat lap trials

39:36.790 --> 39:38.530
# Greased Lightning
Go, Greased Lightning

39:38.660 --> 39:41.240
# You are supreme
The chicks'll cream

39:41.380 --> 39:43.000
# For Greased Lightning

39:43.130 --> 39:45.000
# Go, go, go, go-go-go-go

39:45.130 --> 39:49.180
# With purple French taillights
and 30-inch fins, oh, yeah

39:50.840 --> 39:54.680
# A palomino dashboard
and dual-muffler twins, oh, yeah

39:56.730 --> 39:59.850
# With new pistons, plugs and shocks
I can get off my rocks

39:59.980 --> 40:02.930
# You know that I ain't braggin'
She's a real pussy wagon

40:03.070 --> 40:04.810
# Greased Lightning

40:06.200 --> 40:09.530
# Go, Greased Lightning,
you're burning up the quarter mile

40:09.660 --> 40:11.980
# Greased Lightning
Go, Greased Lightning

40:12.120 --> 40:15.570
# Go, Greased Lightning, you're
coasting through the heat lap trials

40:15.710 --> 40:17.670
# Greased Lightning
Go, Greased Lightning

40:17.790 --> 40:20.460
# You are supreme
The chicks'll cream

40:20.590 --> 40:24.000
- # For Greased Lightning
- # Go, go, go, go-go-go-go-go

41:36.220 --> 41:39.510
# Go, Greased Lightning,
you're burning up the quarter mile

41:39.640 --> 41:42.210
# Greased Lightning
Go, Greased Lightning

41:42.350 --> 41:45.890
# Go, Greased Lightning, you're
coasting through the heat lap trials

41:46.020 --> 41:47.730
# Greased Lightning
Go, Greased Lightning

41:47.860 --> 41:50.780
# You are supreme
The chicks'll cream

41:50.900 --> 41:53.280
# For Greased Lightning

42:05.420 --> 42:07.460
Come on, guys. Let's get to work.

42:08.300 --> 42:09.840
(yelling)

42:25.240 --> 42:28.150
Those Scorpions,
they're asking for it.

42:29.370 --> 42:32.820
Danny, what's up?
You still thinking about that chick?

42:32.950 --> 42:36.040
- You nuts?
- No, I was just thinking.

42:36.170 --> 42:38.740
- Don't think so much.
- That's cool.

42:42.210 --> 42:44.120
Hey, guys.

42:44.260 --> 42:48.040
- Kenickie, Zuko.
- How's it hangin'?

42:48.180 --> 42:50.170
OK, the meeting is in session.

42:53.100 --> 42:57.180
Know what I heard? Last year the fuzz
had Thunder Road staked out.

42:57.320 --> 43:01.610
- Everyone got hauled to the clink.
- No one'll catch Greased Lightning.

43:01.740 --> 43:04.030
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

43:05.070 --> 43:08.410
- Somebody snaking you, Danny?
- Bite the weenie, Rizz.

43:08.540 --> 43:10.450
With relish.

43:14.880 --> 43:18.790
- I don't know about these chicks.
- They're only good for one thing.

43:19.470 --> 43:23.550
What do you do with 'em
the other 23 hours 45 minutes a day?

43:24.470 --> 43:26.130
Does it only take 1 5 minutes?

43:28.940 --> 43:31.230
Want some new music?

43:31.360 --> 43:34.030
- Yeah.
- I'll need some money.

43:36.990 --> 43:38.900
Thanks.

43:42.200 --> 43:44.030
(wolf whistles)

43:45.120 --> 43:46.950
I'll be right back.

43:52.420 --> 43:54.250
Hi, Danny!

43:55.260 --> 43:57.930
- I can't talk.
- What are you doing later?

43:58.050 --> 44:00.630
- I can't talk, alright?
- Call me.

44:11.400 --> 44:13.560
- Hi, Sandy.
- Oh, hi.

44:13.700 --> 44:15.940
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks.

44:16.080 --> 44:17.540
That's good.

44:17.660 --> 44:21.160
Sandy, I've been wanting
to talk to you for a long time.

44:21.290 --> 44:24.290
- What about?
- About the night at the bonfire.

44:24.420 --> 44:26.790
The way I acted, that was terrible.

44:26.920 --> 44:30.130
It wasn't me, you gotta know that.

44:30.260 --> 44:32.830
It was me, of course,
but it wasn't me.

44:34.430 --> 44:37.220
You see, Sandy,
I got this image, right? And...

44:37.350 --> 44:40.770
That's why I'm so glad
that Tom's such a simple person.

44:45.490 --> 44:48.690
Simple's right.
Too bad his brains are in his biceps.

44:49.780 --> 44:51.410
Jealous, are you?

44:52.490 --> 44:55.990
Jealous? Oh, come on, Sandy,
don't make me laugh.

44:57.290 --> 44:59.330
What have you ever done?

45:02.920 --> 45:05.790
Come on! I can run circles
around those jerks.

45:05.930 --> 45:08.090
I'll believe that when I see it.

45:32.130 --> 45:36.450
Let's start with the first rule. Cut
it down to two packs a day. There.

45:40.340 --> 45:43.710
What sort of athletics
are you interested in?

45:43.850 --> 45:44.930
You like the rings?

45:45.060 --> 45:49.270
Yeah, I installed a set
just a couple of weeks ago.

45:51.190 --> 45:54.310
The first thing we have to do
is you have to change.

45:54.440 --> 45:56.570
That's why I'm here, to change.

45:56.700 --> 46:00.030
- No, I mean your clothes.
- Oh.

46:06.750 --> 46:08.790
Alright. Let's knock it off.

46:08.920 --> 46:14.620
Fellas, I wanna introduce a new man.
Danny. Let's give him a tryout.

46:16.970 --> 46:20.890
- Better watch it.
- Come on. A little fire, here we go.

46:34.570 --> 46:36.530
You have to dribble.

46:40.080 --> 46:42.160
- Here you go, Coach.
- Thanks, son.

46:42.290 --> 46:44.660
Dribble the ball,
put it in the basket.

46:44.790 --> 46:47.790
- Think you can do that?
- Can I do that!

46:47.920 --> 46:50.960
- OK.
- Danny, over here. Danny!

46:51.090 --> 46:52.640
Let's go.

46:55.060 --> 46:56.970
That's it. Go, go, go.

46:57.730 --> 46:59.390
Get him, Danny.

47:03.900 --> 47:05.610
- (whistle)
- What'd I do?

47:05.740 --> 47:08.490
- Is he kidding?
- Boy, oh, boy.

47:11.530 --> 47:16.450
I want you to meet
your wrestling partner. Danny, Andy.

47:18.290 --> 47:20.040
Are you crazy?

47:20.170 --> 47:23.370
Come on, come on.
Let's start. Get in first position.

47:23.510 --> 47:25.750
Danny, you get down.

47:25.880 --> 47:28.260
OK, Andy, get down. Ready?

47:31.020 --> 47:32.640
(whistle)

47:33.810 --> 47:35.350
Hold it, hold it.

47:36.230 --> 47:39.100
Danny, you gotta try. Come on.

47:40.610 --> 47:44.310
Alright, Andy, let's change
positions. You get down. Come on.

47:49.450 --> 47:51.330
Alright. Ready?

47:51.460 --> 47:53.170
(whistle)

47:54.380 --> 47:56.120
- Give?
- Yeah, give.

47:56.250 --> 47:57.580
Good.

48:02.720 --> 48:03.720
He's a hitter.

48:07.520 --> 48:11.350
You'll like baseball. It's not
that much of a contact sport.

48:11.480 --> 48:13.940
Get in there and let's see
what you can do.

48:14.070 --> 48:16.020
Throw the ball. Let's play.

48:17.570 --> 48:19.310
Let's pitch this guy out.

48:19.450 --> 48:22.200
- He can't hit.
- This boy can't even bat.

48:22.330 --> 48:25.330
- Strike.
- I told you. He doesn't even swing.

48:25.460 --> 48:28.160
What kind of ball player are you?
Put it in here.

48:30.750 --> 48:32.500
Strike.

48:33.880 --> 48:37.550
Come on. A little fire in there.
Let's see you hit it.

48:41.720 --> 48:43.550
Foul ball.

48:46.310 --> 48:48.560
- Easy, easy.
- Now! Come on.

48:48.690 --> 48:50.850
Put the bat down. Put the bat down.

48:52.570 --> 48:56.070
There's a lot of other sports
that don't have any contact.

48:56.200 --> 48:58.910
- Yeah, like what?
- Like track.

48:59.040 --> 49:02.540
- What do you mean, running?
- Just like running?

49:03.500 --> 49:05.870
I mean something
that needs endurance.

49:06.000 --> 49:10.800
Something that needs stamina.
Like, long-distance running.

49:10.930 --> 49:13.170
Cross-country running.

49:15.510 --> 49:17.760
- That could be cool.
- Good.

49:44.720 --> 49:45.960
Danny.

49:49.930 --> 49:52.170
Danny, are you alright?

49:54.310 --> 49:56.140
Danny, talk to me.

49:57.190 --> 50:00.720
The least you can do is talk to me
after the way you treated me.

50:00.860 --> 50:03.650
The way I... ?
Sandy, I told you I was sorry.

50:03.780 --> 50:05.520
Got you talking.

50:07.030 --> 50:09.700
- You sure you're OK?
- Yes, I'm fine.

50:11.290 --> 50:14.290
- So, still dating that jockstrap?
- Well...

50:15.590 --> 50:19.500
- Is he taking you to the dance?
- Well, that all depends.

50:19.630 --> 50:21.170
- On what?
- On you.

50:21.300 --> 50:23.260
- On me?
- Yeah.

50:23.600 --> 50:25.090
He can stag it.

50:31.020 --> 50:32.560
Come on.

50:32.690 --> 50:34.180
(horn)

50:35.190 --> 50:37.230
(music plays in background)

50:44.250 --> 50:47.660
- Sandy, let's go someplace else.
- Why?

50:49.790 --> 50:51.830
We can't be alone here, that's why.

50:51.960 --> 50:53.540
Danny.

50:55.300 --> 50:56.840
OK.

51:04.810 --> 51:06.770
You nearly pulled my arm out.

51:06.900 --> 51:09.980
I didn't want to miss this table.
It's the best one.

51:11.070 --> 51:14.150
- What are you doing?
- I just want privacy.

51:14.280 --> 51:17.700
- What'll it be, kids?
- Cherry soda, please.

51:17.830 --> 51:19.780
- Danny?
- I'm not very hungry.

51:19.910 --> 51:24.290
Give me a double polar burger with
everything and a soda with ice cream.

51:24.420 --> 51:26.460
Sounds good. I'll have the same.

51:26.590 --> 51:28.750
The same? You can eat a lot.

51:28.880 --> 51:31.250
- You're funny.
- No, you are.

51:31.380 --> 51:35.630
- How ya doing, Zuke? Nice!
- Hiya, Rizzo. How are you?

51:35.760 --> 51:37.920
Peachy keen, jelly bean.

51:38.390 --> 51:41.600
You got any quarters?
We could split an Eskimo Pie.

51:41.730 --> 51:45.980
- My Dutch treat days are over.
- You plan on staying home a lot.

51:46.110 --> 51:49.730
Greetings, pals and gals.
Anybody got 23 cents?

51:49.860 --> 51:52.320
Wanna chip in for a Dog-Sled Delight?

51:52.450 --> 51:56.700
I don't know where my money goes.
A dime here, 1 5 cents there.

51:56.830 --> 51:59.950
In a couple of months
Frenchy can take us all out.

52:00.080 --> 52:01.830
A working girl with income.

52:01.960 --> 52:05.050
Y'know, they don't pay
that much to start with.

52:05.170 --> 52:09.220
It's more than we make. Ante up,
I don't get my allowance till Friday.

52:09.350 --> 52:11.840
- You get an allowance?
- When I'm a good boy.

52:11.970 --> 52:14.550
Viola, a Dog-Sled Delight
with four spoons.

52:14.690 --> 52:17.560
- And an Eskimo Pie with a knife.
- Hi, gang.

52:19.480 --> 52:21.640
Here you are. Grab it and growl.

52:25.740 --> 52:28.070
I got so many hickeys
I look like a leper.

52:28.200 --> 52:32.250
Cheer up. A hickey from Kenickie
is like a Hallmark card.

52:32.370 --> 52:34.610
You care enough
to send the very best.

52:36.250 --> 52:39.540
- You pig.
- I love it when you talk dirty.

52:40.970 --> 52:44.880
My parents want to invite you
to tea on Sunday. Will you come?

52:46.060 --> 52:49.260
- I don't like tea.
- You don't have to drink tea.

52:50.150 --> 52:52.180
Well, I don't like parents.

52:54.610 --> 52:56.980
- Want some?
- Erm, uh-uh.

52:57.110 --> 52:59.070
You sure are a cheap date.

52:59.200 --> 53:02.230
- I didn't mean it like that.
- I understand.

53:02.370 --> 53:05.870
- I always found you understanding.
- I am.

53:06.000 --> 53:09.910
I also think
there's more to you than just fat.

53:10.040 --> 53:12.750
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

53:12.880 --> 53:14.920
- Got a date for the dance-off?
- No.

53:15.050 --> 53:16.250
- Wanna go?
- Yeah.

53:16.380 --> 53:21.090
I'll be a senior forever if
I don't study for that algebra test.

53:21.220 --> 53:24.090
You're in luck.
You got an armed escort home.

53:24.230 --> 53:28.390
It's not the arms I'm worried about,
Sonny. It's the hands.

53:28.520 --> 53:30.520
She loves me.

53:32.570 --> 53:34.860
- You coming, French?
- I don't think so.

53:34.990 --> 53:38.070
- I think I'll hang out a bit longer.
- Alright.

53:38.200 --> 53:43.080
I have been dieting all day long. My
mom's apple pie's better than this.

53:43.210 --> 53:45.450
- Do you want a piece?
- Yeah, sure.

53:46.540 --> 53:47.870
- Putzie.
- Yeah?

53:48.000 --> 53:49.630
1 5 minutes!

53:51.050 --> 53:55.380
I'm worried about this dance-off. Do
they dance differently to back home?

53:55.510 --> 53:59.130
Don't worry.
Maybe we'll invent the Kangaroo Bop.

54:01.060 --> 54:03.100
Let's get out of here, Sandy.

54:03.230 --> 54:04.770
See you later.

54:05.530 --> 54:07.680
- Bye, Frenchy.
- See ya, Sandy.

54:10.240 --> 54:13.530
Great. I'm stuck with the check.
Give me money.

54:14.490 --> 54:18.440
OK, what's with you tonight?
You got the personality of a wet mop.

54:18.580 --> 54:22.660
- Don't start with me.
- Fine. How about I finish with ya?

54:23.460 --> 54:25.460
Finish this!

54:26.510 --> 54:28.050
To you from me, Pinky Lee.

54:30.890 --> 54:32.800
Sorry, French.

54:37.560 --> 54:40.230
(distant) Hey, Rizzo.
I want to talk to you!

54:43.070 --> 54:45.230
No use crying over spilt milk shake.

54:45.360 --> 54:47.110
Oh, I'll be OK.

54:48.830 --> 54:50.870
You know it's near closing time?

54:51.000 --> 54:53.070
Do you mind if I stay a bit longer?

54:53.210 --> 54:55.200
No, suit yourself.

54:55.330 --> 54:57.790
- Wow.
- What?

54:57.920 --> 55:01.290
I hate to tell you, but your
hair looks like an Easter egg.

55:02.180 --> 55:04.000
Oh, yeah.

55:04.140 --> 55:07.470
Well, I had a little trouble
in tinting class.

55:07.600 --> 55:10.880
In fact, I had a little trouble
in all my classes.

55:11.020 --> 55:14.350
Beauty school sure wasn't
what I thought it'd be.

55:14.480 --> 55:16.060
Nothing ever is.

55:19.910 --> 55:26.530
Vi? Erm, ... I dropped out.
What do you think of waitressing?

55:26.660 --> 55:28.620
You're too young to know.

55:29.500 --> 55:32.170
Maybe I could be
a telephone operator.

55:33.340 --> 55:37.170
No, I don't think I'd like to wear
those little things over my ears.

55:37.630 --> 55:43.010
God, if only I could have a guardian
angel to tell me what to do.

55:43.140 --> 55:46.760
Like Debbie Reynolds had in Tammy.
What do you think?

55:47.860 --> 55:50.530
If you find him,
give him my phone number.

56:06.210 --> 56:09.500
# Your story's sad to tell

56:10.380 --> 56:14.080
# A teenage ne'er-do-well

56:15.050 --> 56:20.760
# Most mixed-up non-delinquent
on the block

56:22.440 --> 56:26.600
# Your future's so unclear now

56:27.150 --> 56:30.980
# What's left of your career now?

56:31.620 --> 56:39.330
# Can't even get a trade-in
on your smock

56:54.600 --> 56:56.840
# Beauty school dropout

56:57.940 --> 57:01.140
# No graduation day for you

57:01.280 --> 57:03.320
# Beauty school dropout

57:04.400 --> 57:07.820
# Missed your midterms
and flunked shampoo

57:07.950 --> 57:11.040
# Well, at least
you could have taken time

57:11.160 --> 57:14.280
# To wash and clean your clothes up

57:14.420 --> 57:16.820
# After spending all that dough

57:16.960 --> 57:20.000
# To have the doctor fix your nose up

57:20.130 --> 57:22.090
# Baby, get movin'

57:23.470 --> 57:26.670
# Why keep your feeble hopes alive?

57:26.810 --> 57:29.810
- # What are you provin'?
- # What are you provin'?

57:29.930 --> 57:33.350
# You've got the dream
but not the drive

57:33.480 --> 57:36.480
# If you go for your diploma

57:36.610 --> 57:39.530
# You could join a steno-pool

57:39.650 --> 57:41.690
# Turn in your teasing-comb

57:41.820 --> 57:44.820
# And go back to high school

57:49.040 --> 57:51.500
# Beauty school dropout

57:52.250 --> 57:54.960
# Hangin' around the corner store

57:55.090 --> 57:57.920
# Beauty school dropout

57:58.720 --> 58:02.050
# It's about time you knew the score

58:02.180 --> 58:04.890
# Well, they couldn't
teach you anything

58:05.520 --> 58:08.090
# You think you're such a looker

58:08.650 --> 58:11.680
# But no customer would go to you

58:11.820 --> 58:14.440
# Unless she was a hooker

58:19.490 --> 58:22.530
- # Baby, don't sweat it
- # Don't sweat it

58:22.660 --> 58:25.920
# You're not cut out to hold a job

58:26.040 --> 58:29.160
- # Better forget it
- # Forget it

58:29.300 --> 58:32.380
# Who wants their hair done
by a slob?

58:32.510 --> 58:36.040
# Now your bangs are curled,
your lashes twirled

58:36.180 --> 58:38.850
# But still the world is cruel

58:38.980 --> 58:41.130
# Wipe off that angel face

58:41.270 --> 58:43.590
# And go back to high school

58:45.360 --> 58:47.020
# Baby, don't blow it

58:48.690 --> 58:51.700
# Don't put my good advice to shame

58:51.820 --> 58:53.860
# Baby, you know it

58:55.160 --> 58:58.450
# Even Dear Abby would say the same

58:58.580 --> 59:01.910
# Now, I've called the shot,
get off the pot

59:02.040 --> 59:06.590
# I've really got to fly

59:07.680 --> 59:13.550
# Gotta be going to that malt shop

59:13.680 --> 59:20.140
# In the sky

59:24.570 --> 59:27.490
# Beauty school dropout

59:27.620 --> 59:30.150
# Go back to high school

59:30.910 --> 59:33.830
# Beauty school dropout

59:33.960 --> 59:36.580
# Go back to high school

59:37.170 --> 59:40.170
# Beauty school dropout

59:40.300 --> 59:44.340
# Go back to high school

59:56.650 --> 59:59.570
- Lower your head, Kenickie.
- What are you doing?

59:59.700 --> 01:00:02.070
- Give him a break.
- Oh, I will!

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:04.770
No, we'll work on the brakes later.

01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:06.570
Move over, slick.

01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:08.660
Fruitcake, you got it on backwards.

01:00:08.790 --> 01:00:11.460
- What car did you swipe it from?
- Your mother's.

01:00:19.930 --> 01:00:21.470
Rizz.

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:31.270
Can you believe it?
Nationwide television!

01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:37.860
- How you doing?
- Still gonna go to the dance?

01:00:37.990 --> 01:00:41.160
Man, I'm gonna have
the hottest date there.

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:45.790
Biggest thing to happen to Rydell
and we don't have dates.

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:48.920
- Maybe Rudi from the Capri Lounge?
- Get serious.

01:00:49.050 --> 01:00:51.670
- It's a suggestion.
- I already called him.

01:00:58.430 --> 01:01:01.100
Relax. I think our luck is changing.

01:01:08.030 --> 01:01:10.070
Do you know what you're doing?

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:12.350
What we're doing. Come on.

01:01:42.110 --> 01:01:43.980
Hey, Marty. Lookin' good.

01:01:45.570 --> 01:01:48.440
Would you just excuse me one second?

01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:53.240
Feelin' good, too, huh?

01:01:53.370 --> 01:01:55.950
Sonny. There he is. Vince Fontaine.

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:58.240
I seen better heads on a mug of beer.

01:01:58.380 --> 01:02:03.250
- Grow up. He's the living end.
- Yeah, if you like older guys.

01:02:16.610 --> 01:02:18.190
Danny, this is so exciting.

01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:20.990
You gotta make friends
with the cameraman.

01:02:21.110 --> 01:02:23.270
- You know him?
- His name's Ted.

01:02:24.490 --> 01:02:26.120
Doody, how do I look?

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:29.910
Like a beautiful blonde pineapple.

01:02:32.290 --> 01:02:34.870
You're late, fellas. Where you been?

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.420
- The gym never looked so good.
- You bring the provisions?

01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:40.790
Alright, kids. I want a big circle.

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:47.600
Come on, boys and girls,
we are going on the air very shortly.

01:02:47.730 --> 01:02:53.320
But first, some warm-up numbers
with Johnny Casino and the Gamblers.

01:03:01.370 --> 01:03:06.250
# Oh, baby, rock'n'roll
is here to stay, it will never die

01:03:07.210 --> 01:03:11.250
# It was meant to be that way,
though I don't know why

01:03:11.710 --> 01:03:16.380
# I don't care what people say
Rock'n'roll is here to stay

01:03:16.510 --> 01:03:21.060
# We don't care what people say
Rock'n'roll is here to stay

01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:25.230
# Everybody rock, everybody rock

01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:29.730
# Everybody rock, everybody rock

01:03:30.490 --> 01:03:32.440
# Come on

01:03:32.570 --> 01:03:34.400
# Everybody rock

01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:39.410
# If you don't like rock'n'roll,
think what you'd be missin'

01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:44.200
# If you like to bop and stroll,
come on down and listen

01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:46.710
# Let's all start to have a ball

01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:49.130
# Everybody rock'n'roll

01:03:58.190 --> 01:04:00.680
- What are their names?
- Fred and Ginger.

01:04:00.810 --> 01:04:02.610
Fred and Ginger.

01:04:26.050 --> 01:04:30.720
- I hope I don't get camera fright.
- Don't worry, we'll be cool.

01:04:30.850 --> 01:04:32.720
- Yeah?
- Don't worry?

01:04:32.850 --> 01:04:34.680
Good. Come on, let's go.

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:41.060
# What's that playing on the radio?

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:45.030
# Why do I start swaying to and fro?

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:48.860
# I have never heard
that song before

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.530
# But if I don't hear it any more...

01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:54.830
Why not let me lead for a change?

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:57.000
I can't help it. I'm used to leadin'.

01:04:57.130 --> 01:04:58.670
OK.

01:05:01.010 --> 01:05:04.430
Doody, can't you
turn me around or something?

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:07.010
Don't talk, Frenchy.
I'm trying to count.

01:05:07.890 --> 01:05:09.940
# A melody

01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:11.720
# That's never the same

01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:14.650
# A melody
that's calling your name...

01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:17.780
Have you thought
of singing professionally?

01:05:17.910 --> 01:05:19.950
# (off key) Come back to me-e-e

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:22.650
- # Please...
- Hey, Zuko! Zuke!

01:05:22.790 --> 01:05:25.360
I want you
to meet Cha Cha di Gregorio.

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:27.790
- How you doing, baby?
- Fine.

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:29.000
Who is she?

01:05:29.130 --> 01:05:33.340
They call me Cha Cha, cos I'm
the best dancer at St Bernadette's.

01:05:33.470 --> 01:05:36.630
With the worst reputation.

01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:38.750
Let's go, Sandy.

01:05:38.890 --> 01:05:42.890
- Who's that girl?
- Just a girl I know, that's all.

01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:50.740
Hi.

01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:53.530
I'm Vince Fontaine.

01:05:54.370 --> 01:05:57.700
Do your folks know
I come into your room every night?

01:05:57.830 --> 01:05:59.990
Over KZAZ, that is.

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:05.200
I'm judging the dance contest.

01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:07.050
I don't think I'm entered.

01:06:07.170 --> 01:06:10.130
A knockout like you?
What's your name?

01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:12.590
- Marty.
- Marty what?

01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:16.140
Maraschino. You know, like in cherry.

01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:42.550
- What are you doing?
- Washing my hands.

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:46.960
# You don't remember me

01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:49.550
# But I remember you

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:52.470
# It was not so long ago

01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:54.600
# You broke my heart in two

01:06:54.730 --> 01:06:57.400
# Tears on my pillow

01:06:58.020 --> 01:06:59.940
# Pain in my heart

01:07:00.070 --> 01:07:03.400
# Caused by you,
you, you, you, you...

01:07:03.530 --> 01:07:05.490
How do you know her?

01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:09.030
Erm, she's an old friend
of the family, that's all.

01:07:09.870 --> 01:07:12.360
# Love is not a toy

01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:15.210
# When you find the one you love...

01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:18.120
- Aren't you glad to be back?
- Oh, yeah.

01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:20.930
Besides, blondes do have more fun.

01:07:21.890 --> 01:07:24.590
# If we could start anew

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:26.760
# I wouldn't hesitate...

01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:32.190
When I hear music,
I can't make my feet behave.

01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:35.100
- Thinks she's Tinker Bell.
- Hush, Sonny.

01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:38.150
# Pain in my heart

01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:40.240
# Caused by you

01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:43.030
# You-ou-ou-ou

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:47.740
Sshh.

01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:50.120
The Rydell fight song!

01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:16.200
When you are finished...

01:08:17.290 --> 01:08:21.859
You will be happy to know that
I am not judging the dance contest.

01:08:27.090 --> 01:08:29.660
I think we all owe
a round of applause

01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:33.420
to Patty Simcox and Eugene Felznik
and committee

01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:35.880
for their beautiful decorations.

01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:38.140
Let's hear it for the toilet paper.

01:08:41.899 --> 01:08:47.060
In a few moments, the entire nation
will be watching Rydell High,

01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:51.439
God help us, and I want you all
to be on your best behaviour.

01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:53.569
No heinie-biting.

01:08:55.330 --> 01:08:56.990
And now, here he is,

01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:58.950
the Prince of the Platters,

01:08:59.090 --> 01:09:01.540
Mr Vince Fontaine.

01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:10.850
Mr Vince Fontaine?

01:09:23.410 --> 01:09:25.229
(drum rolls)

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:38.590
Hey, it's great being here
at Rydell High.

01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:42.760
What's your name, sweetheart?

01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:48.180
And now, for the rules.

01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:55.100
Game rule one.
All couples must be boy-girl.

01:09:55.230 --> 01:09:57.360
Too bad, Eugene.

01:09:59.910 --> 01:10:02.070
Alright, alright. Come on.

01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:05.070
Game rule two.
During the dance contest,

01:10:05.210 --> 01:10:10.630
if you're tapped on the shoulder,
leave the floor, or else. I mean it.

01:10:10.750 --> 01:10:13.790
And rule three,
anyone doing tasteless

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:17.260
or vulgar movements
will be disqualified.

01:10:17.390 --> 01:10:19.300
That leaves us out.

01:10:23.060 --> 01:10:25.520
Keep it clean, please. Keep it clean.

01:10:25.650 --> 01:10:27.940
20 seconds.

01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:31.520
Thank you, fans and friends.
Now a few words to the wise.

01:10:31.650 --> 01:10:33.310
You are my best pals.

01:10:33.450 --> 01:10:37.360
To look your best for the contest,
just have a ball, that's all.

01:10:37.490 --> 01:10:39.740
Forget the camera, keep on the beat,

01:10:39.870 --> 01:10:43.320
give the folks at home a treat.
Keep dancin', that's showbiz.

01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:46.210
If I tap you, step aside.
Let the others ride.

01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:49.160
Ten seconds. Nine, eight,

01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:52.880
seven, six, five, four,

01:10:53.010 --> 01:10:56.380
three, two, one. On the air.

01:10:57.060 --> 01:11:00.760
Welcome to National Bandstand,
live from Rydell High School.

01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:03.680
This is what you're waiting for,
the dance-off.

01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:07.230
Away we go with
Johnny Casino and the Gamblers.

01:11:08.950 --> 01:11:11.520
# You ain't nothin' but a hound dog

01:11:11.660 --> 01:11:13.700
# Cryin' all the time

01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:15.910
# You ain't nothin' but a hound dog

01:11:16.670 --> 01:11:18.740
# Cryin' all the time

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:22.880
# You ain't never caught a rabbit
and you ain't no friend of mine

01:11:23.010 --> 01:11:24.960
Look. There's the camera!

01:11:33.850 --> 01:11:35.810
That's Putzie and Jan.

01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:52.160
# Said you was high class,
that was just a lie

01:11:53.580 --> 01:11:57.530
# Call yourself high class,
that was just a lie

01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:00.950
# Well, you ain't never
caught a rabbit...

01:12:01.090 --> 01:12:03.720
Oh, there's Danny and Sandy.

01:12:03.850 --> 01:12:05.890
# You ain't nothin' but a hound dog

01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:07.470
# Cryin' all the time

01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:13.060
# Cryin' all the time

01:12:13.190 --> 01:12:16.890
# You ain't never caught a rabbit
and you ain't no friend of mine

01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:22.320
(song ends)

01:12:22.450 --> 01:12:26.120
Now the event you've all been
waiting for, the national dance-off.

01:12:26.250 --> 01:12:29.200
Some guy and gal will get
some fantabulous prizes.

01:12:29.330 --> 01:12:32.830
Don't feel bad if I tap you out.
It don't matter if you win or lose,

01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:35.720
it's what you do
with your dancin' shoes.

01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:38.330
Does everybody here know Marty?

01:12:40.510 --> 01:12:43.970
OK, cats, throw your mittens
round your kittens. Away we go!

01:12:48.230 --> 01:12:50.470
That wasn't supposed to happen!

01:12:50.610 --> 01:12:53.100
Let's go, let's hand-jive!

01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:57.490
# Before I was born late one night

01:12:58.450 --> 01:13:00.910
# My papa said everything's alright

01:13:02.210 --> 01:13:04.040
# The doctor made my ma lay down...

01:13:04.170 --> 01:13:06.540
Guy with the girl in red,
throw 'em out.

01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:11.800
# Cos the bebop stork
was about to arrive

01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:14.050
# Mama gave birth to the hand-jive

01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:17.590
# I could barely walk
when I milked a cow

01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:21.560
# When I was three I pushed a plough

01:13:22.650 --> 01:13:25.320
# While choppin' wood
I'd move my legs

01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:29.490
# And I started dancin'
while I gathered eggs

01:13:30.450 --> 01:13:32.410
# Townsfolk clapped, I was only five

01:13:32.530 --> 01:13:35.110
# I'd outdance 'em all,
I was born to hand-jive

01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:38.960
Yes, split 'em, buddy.

01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:41.710
Go, go, go, go.

01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:43.800
Shake it. Shake it.

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:45.830
Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy.

01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:48.430
Attagirl!

01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:51.800
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:13:51.930 --> 01:13:55.770
Everybody!
# Born to hand-jive, baby

01:13:56.650 --> 01:13:59.930
# Born to hand-jive, baby

01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:03.480
Here we go.

01:14:04.370 --> 01:14:06.400
Hey, break it up! What is that?

01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:13.530
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:14:14.790 --> 01:14:16.950
C'mon now, shake it!

01:14:17.090 --> 01:14:18.460
Yeah.

01:14:19.510 --> 01:14:20.920
Twist it!

01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:32.390
Alright, get it!

01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:05.840
# How low can you go?

01:15:05.980 --> 01:15:07.720
# How low can you go?

01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:09.430
# How low can you go?

01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:41.020
There you go!

01:15:43.150 --> 01:15:45.140
C'mon now, hand-jive!

01:16:07.470 --> 01:16:09.710
That's the stuff!

01:16:12.810 --> 01:16:14.390
Do it, baby!

01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:18.100
Do it!

01:16:28.700 --> 01:16:31.570
That's the hand-jive grand-jive!

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:53.770
Yeah, let's bring it up now!

01:16:54.230 --> 01:16:55.310
Bring it on up!

01:16:58.240 --> 01:16:59.400
Higher!

01:16:59.530 --> 01:17:01.110
Higher.

01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:04.740
Higher and higher!

01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:08.500
# Now can you hand-jive, baby?

01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:12.000
# Oh, can you hand-jive, baby?

01:17:12.710 --> 01:17:14.340
# Oh, yeah

01:17:18.550 --> 01:17:20.710
# Born to hand-jive, oh, yeah!

01:17:20.850 --> 01:17:22.680
Oh, yeah!

01:17:22.810 --> 01:17:24.970
Here they are, the new champs.

01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:27.260
Come on up here.

01:17:29.190 --> 01:17:33.400
- Can I have your names, please?
- Cha Cha di Gregorio and Danny Zuko.

01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:37.820
- We'll do it now.
- Where's Marty?

01:17:37.950 --> 01:17:40.410
- Don't worry, she's in good hands.
- Whose?

01:17:42.870 --> 01:17:46.040
Now let's see our champs
in a spotlight dance.

01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:51.880
- # Blue moon
- # Blue, blue, blue, blue moon

01:17:52.010 --> 01:17:55.840
# You saw me standing alone

01:17:58.810 --> 01:18:02.940
# Without a dream in my heart

01:18:05.070 --> 01:18:09.190
# Without a love of my own...

01:18:10.910 --> 01:18:13.480
Ready? One, one, two, three, go.

01:18:13.620 --> 01:18:15.860
# Blue moon...

01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:21.790
Who's that on the right?

01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:26.300
We have pictures
of you so-called mooners.

01:18:26.430 --> 01:18:30.890
Just because it's not your faces
doesn't mean we can't identify you.

01:18:31.010 --> 01:18:35.060
At this very moment, those pictures
are on the way to Washington,

01:18:35.190 --> 01:18:40.390
where the FBI has experts
in this type of identification.

01:18:40.530 --> 01:18:45.270
If you turn yourselves in now,
you may escape a federal charge.

01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:10.850
C'mon, Doody. Watch your hands.
Move it out.

01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:13.350
I feel like a meatball in here.

01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:15.600
Let's go find the chicks.

01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:18.150
Marty. Marty.

01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:26.490
Hold my money. Don't let me
go near the refreshment stand.

01:19:26.620 --> 01:19:29.910
- I'm not hungry.
- Hey. What's happening?

01:19:31.210 --> 01:19:33.250
There's nobody here.

01:19:37.050 --> 01:19:40.140
Come on, Sandy.
I told you on the phone I was sorry.

01:19:40.260 --> 01:19:43.470
- I know you did.
- You believe me, don't you?

01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:46.800
Yes, but I still think
you and Cha Cha went together.

01:19:47.900 --> 01:19:50.770
We did not go together.
We just went together.

01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:53.900
- It's the same thing.
- No. No.

01:20:16.050 --> 01:20:18.100
- (screams)
- Ohh!

01:20:18.220 --> 01:20:19.890
Sandy, I'm sorry.

01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:31.020
Sandy...

01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:34.570
Would you wear my ring?

01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:37.160
Danny. I don't know what to say.

01:20:37.290 --> 01:20:39.370
- Say, yes.
- Yes.

01:20:44.210 --> 01:20:49.420
Danny, this means so much to me.
Cos I know now that you respect me.

01:20:57.350 --> 01:20:58.680
Hey, Rizz?

01:20:58.810 --> 01:21:00.230
Watch it.

01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:05.230
- What's with you tonight?
- I feel like a defective typewriter.

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:07.940
- I skipped a period.
- You think you're PG?

01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:09.530
I don't know. Big deal.

01:21:09.660 --> 01:21:12.530
- Was it Kenickie?
- Nah, you don't know the guy.

01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:14.460
Rizz, look, it's OK.

01:21:14.580 --> 01:21:18.500
I caught Vince Fontaine putting
aspirin in my Coke at the dance.

01:21:18.630 --> 01:21:19.630
Hey.

01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:24.630
- Marty, you won't tell no one?
- Sure, I'll take it to the grave.

01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:32.140
Coming through, coming through.
Come on, lady with a baby.

01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:37.470
Hey, Marty, what's up?

01:21:37.610 --> 01:21:39.440
Rizzo's pregnant.

01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:47.160
Rizzo's got a bun in the oven.

01:21:58.470 --> 01:22:00.300
Rizzo's knocked up.

01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:06.560
Rizzo, I hear you're knocked up.

01:22:06.690 --> 01:22:09.890
You do?
Boy, good news really travels fast.

01:22:10.780 --> 01:22:12.820
Why didn't ya tell me about it?

01:22:13.490 --> 01:22:15.110
What's it to ya?

01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:18.360
- I might be able to do something.
- You did enough.

01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:23.250
I don't run away from my mistakes.

01:22:23.370 --> 01:22:27.450
Don't worry about it, Kenickie.
It was somebody else's mistake.

01:22:33.090 --> 01:22:34.920
Thanks a lot, kid.

01:22:35.890 --> 01:22:37.630
Any time.

01:22:43.310 --> 01:22:45.770
- (sneezes)
- Are you getting a cold?

01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:50.560
No. It's probably
a little drive-in dust, that's all.

01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:05.290
- Danny!
- Sandy! Oh, Sandy...

01:23:05.420 --> 01:23:07.460
Danny, what are you doing?

01:23:07.590 --> 01:23:09.750
Don't worry, nobody's watchin'.

01:23:09.890 --> 01:23:13.300
- Get off me.
- Sandy, what's the matter with you?

01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:17.050
I thought I meant something to you.

01:23:17.190 --> 01:23:22.400
Think I'm gonna stay with you in this
sin-wagon? Take this piece of tin!

01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:25.850
Sandy, you can't walk out
of a drive-in!

01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:38.540
# Stranded at the drive-in

01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:43.130
# Branded a fool

01:23:44.010 --> 01:23:46.470
# What will they say

01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:50.640
# Monday at school?

01:23:58.190 --> 01:24:00.230
# Sandy

01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:02.440
# Can't you see

01:24:02.570 --> 01:24:05.280
# I'm in misery?

01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:08.790
# We made a start

01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:11.070
# Now we're apart

01:24:11.210 --> 01:24:14.410
# There's nothing left for me

01:24:15.710 --> 01:24:17.750
# Love has flown

01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:19.760
# All alone

01:24:19.890 --> 01:24:24.020
# I sit and wonder why-aye-aye

01:24:24.140 --> 01:24:27.560
# Why you left me

01:24:28.650 --> 01:24:30.390
# Oh, Sandy

01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:34.230
# Oh, Sandy

01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:36.440
# Maybe

01:24:36.570 --> 01:24:38.320
# Someday

01:24:38.450 --> 01:24:41.570
# When high school is done

01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:46.530
# Somehow, some way

01:24:47.290 --> 01:24:50.580
# Our two worlds will be one

01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:53.760
# In heaven

01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:55.930
# Forever

01:24:56.050 --> 01:24:59.470
# And ever we will be

01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:03.850
# Please, say you'll stay

01:25:04.940 --> 01:25:07.180
# Oh, Sandy

01:25:10.570 --> 01:25:13.140
Sandy, my darling,

01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:15.320
you hurt me real bad.

01:25:16.410 --> 01:25:18.450
You know it's true.

01:25:19.210 --> 01:25:22.210
But, baby, you gotta believe me
when I say...

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.040
...I'm helpless without you.

01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:29.000
# Love has flown

01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:30.960
# All alone

01:25:31.100 --> 01:25:35.140
# I sit, I wonder why-aye-aye

01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:39.100
# Why you left me

01:25:39.980 --> 01:25:42.440
# Oh, Sandy

01:25:44.570 --> 01:25:46.610
# Sandy

01:25:49.030 --> 01:25:51.190
# Sandy

01:25:55.630 --> 01:25:59.330
# Why-aye-aye-aye?

01:26:01.050 --> 01:26:02.880
Oh, Sandy!

01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:09.560
Head it out. Come on, guys.

01:26:16.690 --> 01:26:18.810
Well, the crate shaped up.

01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:22.280
- It's as hot as the parts on it.
- We didn't steal all of it.

01:26:22.410 --> 01:26:26.030
- Some of it was donated.
- Just wait till Thunder Road.

01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:28.740
Right. You could still
change your mind.

01:26:28.870 --> 01:26:32.540
- The flag is in three hours.
- And Greased Lightning strikes.

01:26:32.670 --> 01:26:35.500
- You coming?
- My boys won't let me down,

01:26:35.630 --> 01:26:37.500
and I won't let them down.

01:26:40.140 --> 01:26:42.290
I wanna talk to you.

01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:47.970
Those guys at Thunder Road
don't fool around, you know.

01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:51.020
You want me to punk out?

01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:54.400
No, I'm not saying punking out,
I'm just...

01:26:55.700 --> 01:26:57.740
You know what I mean.

01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:01.280
Hey, Danny, erm...

01:27:01.410 --> 01:27:03.570
We been friends a long time, right?

01:27:04.250 --> 01:27:05.870
Yeah.

01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:09.750
You remember the drive-in
the other night?

01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:13.380
The movie with the duel,
the guy's best friend went with him

01:27:13.510 --> 01:27:15.630
as his lieutenant, his second?

01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:17.590
Yeah. So?

01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:24.260
Well, I thought that... you could
maybe be my second at Thunder Road.

01:27:24.900 --> 01:27:27.770
What, you want me
to drive with you or what?

01:27:39.370 --> 01:27:41.950
Listen, I'll pick you up at three,
alright?

01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:46.540
Open up the door.
What are you sitting around for?

01:27:46.670 --> 01:27:49.680
Take the can off
the front of the car, you putz.

01:27:56.190 --> 01:27:58.850
Hello, Rizz.
Are you going to Thunder Road?

01:27:58.980 --> 01:28:00.310
Not a chance.

01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:02.600
I have to go.
I have to talk to Danny.

01:28:02.740 --> 01:28:06.070
Without wheels and a motor,
he won't know you're alive.

01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:09.900
We haven't been friends,
but if there's anything I can do...

01:28:10.030 --> 01:28:14.080
I can take care of myself.
And anybody else who comes along.

01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:18.370
You think I don't know
what people are saying about me?

01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:20.160
Hey.

01:28:23.930 --> 01:28:25.090
Thanks.

01:28:35.610 --> 01:28:38.280
That's the one
I was telling you about.

01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:43.480
# There are worse things I could do

01:28:44.370 --> 01:28:47.870
# Than go with a boy or two

01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:51.320
# Even though the neighbourhood

01:28:51.460 --> 01:28:54.630
# Thinks I'm trashy and no good

01:28:55.420 --> 01:28:58.510
# I suppose it could be true

01:28:59.180 --> 01:29:02.880
# But there are worse things
I could do

01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:08.520
# I could flirt with all the guys

01:29:11.150 --> 01:29:15.810
# Smile at them and bat my eyes

01:29:18.370 --> 01:29:21.990
# Press against them when we dance

01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:25.540
# Make them think they stand a chance

01:29:25.670 --> 01:29:28.950
# Then refuse to see it through

01:29:30.250 --> 01:29:32.710
# That's a thing I'd never do

01:29:33.380 --> 01:29:38.550
# I could stay home every night

01:29:40.060 --> 01:29:44.390
# Wait around for Mr Right

01:29:47.150 --> 01:29:50.570
# Take cold showers every day

01:29:50.700 --> 01:29:53.570
# And throw my life away

01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:57.330
# On a dream that won't come true

01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:04.620
# I could hurt someone like me

01:30:07.170 --> 01:30:12.550
# Out of spite or jealousy

01:30:14.270 --> 01:30:17.550
# I don't steal and I don't lie

01:30:17.690 --> 01:30:21.020
# But I can feel and I can cry

01:30:21.150 --> 01:30:25.280
# A fact I'll bet you never knew

01:30:28.870 --> 01:30:33.410
# But to cry in front of you

01:30:35.750 --> 01:30:38.420
# That's the worst thing

01:30:38.540 --> 01:30:42.590
# I could do

01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:30.640
- You guys think you got a winner?
- That's right.

01:31:30.770 --> 01:31:33.860
Takes more than a coat of paint
on Thunder Road.

01:31:33.990 --> 01:31:37.100
- Oh, yeah?
- Not thinking of changing your mind?

01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:40.070
- No way.
- Good. Cos we're racing for pinks.

01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:41.700
Pinks?

01:31:41.830 --> 01:31:44.400
Pinks, punk.
Pink slips. Ownership papers.

01:31:48.250 --> 01:31:51.000
Stop. Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

01:31:52.510 --> 01:31:54.550
Hey, get the dude, man.

01:32:00.770 --> 01:32:05.560
- What did she give him?
- A lock of hair. From her chest.

01:32:08.070 --> 01:32:09.890
Poor Kenickie.

01:32:12.410 --> 01:32:16.570
See a penny, pick it up,
all day long you'll have good luck.

01:32:16.700 --> 01:32:18.530
Gimme that.

01:32:21.160 --> 01:32:23.950
If it were in any better condition,
it would fly.

01:32:24.090 --> 01:32:28.250
- She's gonna.
- I brought you this for good luck.

01:32:28.380 --> 01:32:29.710
Gee, thanks.

01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:31.550
- I'm sorry.
- I'll get it.

01:32:37.430 --> 01:32:39.180
You putz!

01:32:40.690 --> 01:32:42.150
Put this under his head.

01:32:43.650 --> 01:32:46.820
- Zuko, he's out cold.
- What are we gonna do?

01:32:46.950 --> 01:32:50.030
Kenickie. Talk to me, buddy.

01:32:50.580 --> 01:32:52.200
You OK?

01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:55.450
Yeah. I'm OK.

01:32:55.580 --> 01:32:57.330
I'm fine. (groans)

01:32:57.460 --> 01:33:00.870
- You can't drive.
- No, really, I'm alright.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.160
I'm just seeing two of you, man.

01:33:04.680 --> 01:33:08.380
- Hey, you want me to drive for you?
- Huh?

01:33:08.510 --> 01:33:11.010
Yeah. Yeah.

01:33:11.770 --> 01:33:13.350
Alright. Help him up.

01:33:14.190 --> 01:33:16.600
Marty, give me a hand.

01:33:22.700 --> 01:33:25.110
(car engines start)

01:33:31.460 --> 01:33:33.120
Hey.

01:33:33.250 --> 01:33:35.460
The rules are, there ain't no rules.

01:33:35.590 --> 01:33:38.460
To the second bridge and back.
First one back wins.

01:33:40.220 --> 01:33:41.960
Haul ass, kid.

01:34:01.620 --> 01:34:03.860
You ain't gonna see me
for dust, Zuko.

01:34:36.830 --> 01:34:38.030
Come on, baby.

01:36:26.370 --> 01:36:30.210
# For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow

01:36:30.340 --> 01:36:34.550
# For he's a jolly good fellow
Which nobody can deny

01:36:36.390 --> 01:36:39.050
# Look at me

01:36:39.180 --> 01:36:42.180
# There has to be

01:36:42.730 --> 01:36:44.680
# Something more

01:36:44.810 --> 01:36:47.600
# Than what they see

01:36:48.270 --> 01:36:50.850
# Wholesome and pure

01:36:50.990 --> 01:36:54.520
# Oh, so scared and unsure

01:36:54.660 --> 01:36:59.400
# A poor man's Sandra Dee

01:36:59.540 --> 01:37:00.870
Danny won.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.450
- Isn't that great?
- Yeah.

01:37:05.590 --> 01:37:08.120
What's the matter? Aren't you happy?

01:37:08.260 --> 01:37:12.300
Not really. But I think I know a way
I could be. Could you help me?

01:37:12.890 --> 01:37:15.050
- Of course.
- Can I come to your place?

01:37:15.180 --> 01:37:16.810
Sure. Come on.

01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:26.400
# Sandy, you must start anew

01:37:27.150 --> 01:37:31.530
# Don't you know what you must do?

01:37:31.660 --> 01:37:33.900
# Hold your head high

01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:38.420
- # Take a deep breath and sigh...
- Come on, Sandy.

01:37:38.540 --> 01:37:40.540
# Goodbye

01:37:40.670 --> 01:37:46.840
# To Sandra Dee

01:38:02.820 --> 01:38:04.360
Attention, seniors.

01:38:04.490 --> 01:38:07.610
Before the merriment
of commencement commences,

01:38:07.740 --> 01:38:10.950
I hope your years with us here
at Rydell High

01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:14.170
have prepared you
for the challenges you face.

01:38:14.290 --> 01:38:18.920
Who knows, among you, there may be
a future Eleanor Roosevelt,

01:38:19.050 --> 01:38:21.460
or a Rosemary Clooney.

01:38:21.590 --> 01:38:23.920
And among you young men,
there may be

01:38:24.050 --> 01:38:27.390
a Joe DiMaggio,
a President Eisenhower

01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:30.390
or even a Vice President Nixon.

01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:35.560
But always you will have
the glorious memories of Rydell High.

01:38:35.690 --> 01:38:38.610
Rydell forever. Bon voyage.

01:38:39.660 --> 01:38:41.820
(chimes)

01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:47.740
Oh, Blanche, stop blubbering.

01:38:52.750 --> 01:38:54.580
(cheering)

01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:31.630
- How many?
- One.

01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:34.390
(bell rings)

01:39:36.180 --> 01:39:38.850
I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.

01:39:38.980 --> 01:39:40.520
How did I flunk phys ed?

01:39:40.650 --> 01:39:42.220
Did I take phys ed?

01:39:43.860 --> 01:39:47.310
Step right up here!
It's for a wonderful cause.

01:39:47.450 --> 01:39:51.990
The Teachers' Retirement Fund.
Give 'em a pie in the puss.

01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:54.360
Coach, how could you flunk
the T-Birds?

01:39:54.500 --> 01:39:58.450
Don't worry. You'll get diplomas.
Just come back to summer school.

01:39:58.580 --> 01:40:01.040
- Summer school?
- Look out!

01:40:03.710 --> 01:40:06.720
If you'd come to class,
you wouldn't have missed me.

01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:09.250
Wise guy, huh? Take that, Coach!

01:40:11.220 --> 01:40:13.550
Why, you couldn't pitch one inning.

01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:20.720
- What's your name? I want you.
- Eugene.

01:40:20.860 --> 01:40:23.570
- You're a great pitcher.
- Thank you.

01:40:33.130 --> 01:40:36.130
Rizzo! Rizzo!

01:40:36.250 --> 01:40:38.660
Get off of that. You got a condition.

01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:42.630
Forget it. It was a false alarm.
I'm not pregnant.

01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:44.390
Whoo-hooo!

01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:50.090
I'Il, erm,
make an honest woman of you.

01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:53.930
Listen, fella, if this is a line,
I ain't biting.

01:40:54.820 --> 01:40:56.560
That's a bona fide offer.

01:40:56.690 --> 01:40:59.360
Well, it ain't moonlight and roses,
but...

01:41:07.540 --> 01:41:11.040
- Hey, there's Zuko.
- You gotta be kidding, man!

01:41:13.590 --> 01:41:17.120
- What is this? Halloween?
- Where did you swipe the sweater?

01:41:17.260 --> 01:41:21.050
While you tools were out stealing
hubcaps, I lettered in track.

01:41:21.180 --> 01:41:23.890
I can't believe it.
Danny Zuko turned jock?

01:41:24.020 --> 01:41:27.220
- That's right, I did.
- What you doing? Deserting us?

01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:30.230
You guys can't follow a leader
all your lives.

01:41:31.110 --> 01:41:34.610
Come on, you know you mean
a lot to me, but Sandy does, too.

01:41:34.740 --> 01:41:37.110
I'm gonna do anything I can
to get her.

01:41:41.500 --> 01:41:43.570
(wolf whistles)

01:41:49.050 --> 01:41:50.670
Sandy?

01:41:51.970 --> 01:41:54.040
Tell me about it, stud.

01:42:02.190 --> 01:42:04.150
# I got chills

01:42:04.270 --> 01:42:06.230
# They're multiplyin'

01:42:06.570 --> 01:42:11.030
# And I'm losing control

01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:13.200
# Cos the power

01:42:13.330 --> 01:42:15.320
# You're supplyin'

01:42:15.450 --> 01:42:17.860
# It's electrifyin'

01:42:24.590 --> 01:42:26.460
# You better shape up

01:42:27.010 --> 01:42:29.250
# Cos I need a man

01:42:30.220 --> 01:42:32.710
# And my heart is set on you

01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:35.840
# You better shape up

01:42:35.980 --> 01:42:37.770
# You better understand

01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:41.470
# To my heart I must be true

01:42:41.610 --> 01:42:45.110
# Nothin' left,
nothin' left for me to do

01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:47.860
- # You're the one that I want
- # You are the one I want

01:42:47.990 --> 01:42:49.780
# Ooh, ooh, ooh, honey

01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:52.200

# The one I need

01:43:00.470 --> 01:43:02.750
# Oh, yes indeed

01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:11.930
# If you're filled with affection

01:43:12.060 --> 01:43:16.310
# You're too shy to convey

01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:20.990
# Meditate in my direction

01:43:21.740 --> 01:43:24.110
- # Feel your way
- Wow!

01:43:25.620 --> 01:43:27.660
# I better shape up

01:43:27.790 --> 01:43:31.210
- # Cos you need a man
- # I need a man

01:43:31.340 --> 01:43:33.910
# Who can keep me satisfied

01:43:34.590 --> 01:43:36.960
# I better shape up

01:43:37.090 --> 01:43:40.180
- # If I'm gonna prove
- # You better prove

01:43:40.310 --> 01:43:42.590
# That my faith is justified

01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:46.260
- # Are you sure?
- # Yes, I'm sure down deep inside

01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:49.100
- # You're the one that I want
- # You are the one I want

01:43:49.230 --> 01:43:50.890

(bell rings)

01:45:01.150 --> 01:45:04.110
Hey, everybody.
Rizzo and Kenickie made up.

01:45:04.240 --> 01:45:06.690
Alright!

01:45:06.820 --> 01:45:08.480
Look! The gang's together.

01:45:08.620 --> 01:45:10.740
What will we do after graduation?

01:45:10.870 --> 01:45:13.440
Maybe we'll never see each other.

01:45:13.580 --> 01:45:15.820
- That won't happen.
- How do you know?

01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:17.290
What do you mean?

01:45:18.340 --> 01:45:19.370
(bell rings)

01:45:19.510 --> 01:45:22.710

# I solve my problems

01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:15.950
# Is the word that you've heard

# It's got groove, it's got meaning

01:49:21.250 --> 01:49:25.630
