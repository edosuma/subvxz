00:08.708 --> 00:09.609
Hi, guys.

00:09.609 --> 00:11.111
Oh, hey, Dad.

00:11.111 --> 00:12.612
Your cappuccinoto go.

00:12.612 --> 00:14.614
Holiday cookies,
anyone?

00:14.614 --> 00:15.615
Oh...
Oh...

00:15.615 --> 00:16.616
Yes, I believe
I will. Thank you.

00:16.616 --> 00:18.118
No, not for me.

00:18.118 --> 00:19.119
Watching your weight?

00:19.119 --> 00:20.108
Yeah, and it's killing me.

00:20.620 --> 00:21.621
But the other night,

00:21.621 --> 00:23.123
Ronee made a comment
about my "bowl full of jelly. "

00:23.123 --> 00:25.625
Well, everyone puts on
a few this time of year.

00:25.625 --> 00:28.128
Everyone doesn't sit around
reading the newspaper

00:28.128 --> 00:30.630
actually slurping
from a bowl full of jelly.

00:30.630 --> 00:32.531
Well, you look great
to me, Martin.

00:32.531 --> 00:33.533
Thanks.

00:33.533 --> 00:35.228
Merry Christmas.

00:35.535 --> 00:37.230
Oh... Eddie and I
must have walked
about three miles.

00:37.537 --> 00:38.526
I'm sweating like a pig.

00:40.540 --> 00:41.541
What the hell are you doing?

00:41.541 --> 00:43.543
I am saving that seat
for someone

00:43.543 --> 00:46.446
who may not wish to have it
bedewed with pig sweat.

00:46.446 --> 00:47.647
Frasier?

00:47.647 --> 00:49.149
Oh, Natalie!

00:49.149 --> 00:50.639
Hi.
Hello.

00:51.151 --> 00:53.153
This is my father,
Martin Crane.

00:53.153 --> 00:54.154
Natalie Blanc

00:54.154 --> 00:55.655
of the Seattle
Tourism Board.

00:55.655 --> 00:57.157
She wants me to do
a promo for them.

00:57.157 --> 00:58.658
He was just leaving.

00:58.658 --> 01:01.661
Oh, that little dog is adorable.

01:01.661 --> 01:03.163
Yes, and he's smart
as a chimp, too.

01:03.163 --> 01:04.152
Off you go.

01:04.664 --> 01:07.167
Oh...
Please...

01:07.167 --> 01:08.668
It's so lovely
to finally meet you.

01:08.668 --> 01:10.170
Thank you, thank you.
Have a seat.

01:10.170 --> 01:12.161
So... tell me
about this promo.

01:12.672 --> 01:15.675
Well, it's
pretty simple.

01:15.675 --> 01:17.666
It begins with you at home
on the couch.

01:18.178 --> 01:19.179
And you say...

01:19.179 --> 01:21.170
"Anybody feel
like taking a walk?

01:21.681 --> 01:23.183
Then come to Seattle. "

01:23.183 --> 01:26.186
And then we see you walking
at the Space Needle, the beach,

01:26.186 --> 01:27.175
the fish market...

01:27.687 --> 01:28.688
But we do all of that
with special effects.

01:28.688 --> 01:31.191
It should only take a couple
of hours tomorrow.

01:31.191 --> 01:33.693
So... are you in?

01:33.693 --> 01:35.695
I'm in.

01:35.695 --> 01:37.197
You know, it's funny.

01:37.197 --> 01:38.698
When you called me at
the last minute, there was

01:38.698 --> 01:40.700
a small, madly insecure
part of me

01:40.700 --> 01:43.703
that wondered if I was
your second choice.

01:43.703 --> 01:44.692
No, you weren't the second.

01:47.207 --> 01:48.196
Nice meeting you.
You, too.

01:48.708 --> 01:50.710
Oh...

01:50.710 --> 01:52.712
Oh, that dog
is so precious.

01:52.712 --> 01:55.203
Yes, there are times I could
just squeeze him to death.

01:57.183 --> 01:58.275
You know,

01:58.785 --> 02:00.286
maybe he should be
in the spot with you.

02:00.286 --> 02:01.287
Eddie in a commercial?

02:01.287 --> 02:02.288
Mm-hmm.

02:02.288 --> 02:03.790
It's called a spot, Dad.

02:03.790 --> 02:04.779
You look so perfect
together.

02:05.291 --> 02:06.793
He could just sit next
to you on the couch.

02:06.793 --> 02:07.794
Well...

02:07.794 --> 02:08.794
I suppose
there's no harm

02:08.794 --> 02:10.797
in a little
window dressing.

02:10.797 --> 02:13.299
The director will love i
t. I'll call him right now.

02:13.299 --> 02:15.301
Oh, I don't believe it.

02:15.301 --> 02:16.302
Eddie's first TV spot.

02:16.302 --> 02:17.804
Oh, knock it off.

02:17.804 --> 02:20.295
You didn't even know that term
'til ten seconds ago.

02:26.779 --> 02:28.281
Hey, Fras.
How'd the big shoot go?

02:28.281 --> 02:29.782
Well, it went splendidly, Dad.

02:29.782 --> 02:31.784
I thought you were going
with Niles to the airport

02:31.784 --> 02:33.219
to get Freddy.

02:33.219 --> 02:34.821
Yeah, I decided to stay home
and do some decorating.

02:34.821 --> 02:37.323
Ah, yes,

02:37.323 --> 02:39.814
the magical time of year
when the Great Wall of China

02:40.326 --> 02:42.795
and my apartment are
the only two man-made structures

02:42.795 --> 02:44.285
visible from space.

02:44.564 --> 02:46.666
I must say
I'm really excited

02:46.666 --> 02:49.369
about seeing Freddy
this trip.

02:49.369 --> 02:50.666
Whatcha got planned?

02:51.371 --> 02:53.362
Oh, gosh, everything
from whale watching to a trip

02:53.673 --> 02:54.674
to the garlic festival.

02:54.674 --> 02:56.539
(doorbell ringing)

02:58.411 --> 02:59.412
Niles, Daphne...

02:59.412 --> 03:01.414
Where's Frederick?

03:01.414 --> 03:04.918
Actually, he insisted
on taking his own elevator.

03:04.918 --> 03:07.420
(chuckling):
Oh, priceless.

03:07.420 --> 03:08.421
Just when you're worried

03:08.421 --> 03:10.423
that he's on the brink
of terrible teendom,

03:10.423 --> 03:11.925
there he is,
still just a little boy

03:11.925 --> 03:13.927
who wants to play
in the elevator.

03:13.927 --> 03:15.929
(laughing)

03:15.929 --> 03:16.930
Hey, Dad.

03:16.930 --> 03:17.919
There he is.

03:18.431 --> 03:19.921
(screams)

03:21.935 --> 03:23.937
Nice greeting, Dad.

03:23.937 --> 03:25.939
Freddy, why are you
dressed like this?

03:25.939 --> 03:27.429
w.
He's a Goth no

03:31.377 --> 03:33.345
You all don't have to treat me
like I'm some kind of freak.

03:33.846 --> 03:35.336
No, we're not, Freddy.

03:35.848 --> 03:37.350
It's great to see you.

03:37.350 --> 03:40.342
Maybe you could move up that
trip to the garlic festival.

03:44.791 --> 03:47.293
Listen, Frederick,
I don 't understand.

03:47.293 --> 03:51.297
Um, the Goths
were plunderers.

03:51.297 --> 03:52.799
Apart from your tendency

03:52.799 --> 03:54.790
to be overaggressive
with your rooks at chess camp,

03:55.301 --> 03:56.791
I don't see the connection.

03:57.303 --> 03:59.305
It's just what
I'm into now, okay?

03:59.305 --> 04:01.808
Me, my friend Andi...
a bunch of us.

04:01.808 --> 04:03.298
But if you don't get i
t, you don't get it.

04:03.810 --> 04:04.299
We get it.

04:04.811 --> 04:05.812
It's wonderful.

04:05.812 --> 04:07.302
FRASIER:
I didn't mean
anything by it.

04:07.814 --> 04:08.303
I simply thought...

04:08.815 --> 04:09.804
Oh, dear God!

04:13.920 --> 04:15.421
Well, thank you, Lilith

04:15.421 --> 04:18.791
for mentioning
this little development.

04:18.791 --> 04:20.293
Oh, it's just a phase.

04:20.293 --> 04:21.594
All teenagers go through
a rebellious period.

04:21.594 --> 04:23.425
It always passes.

04:23.596 --> 04:25.365
You should have seen me
at that age.

04:25.365 --> 04:28.368
Dating the older boys,
hitchhiking, drinking,

04:28.368 --> 04:30.370
shoplifting...

04:30.370 --> 04:33.669
Do you know I can carry
a frozen turkey
between my knees?

04:39.279 --> 04:41.581
That'll come in handy

04:41.581 --> 04:45.351
if we ever misplace our
serving platter at Thanksgiving.

04:45.351 --> 04:48.755
Hey, and didn't you tell m
e you went streaking?

04:48.755 --> 04:50.823
Well, I had shin splints
at the time

04:50.823 --> 04:53.493
so it was really more
of a brisk nude walk.

04:53.493 --> 04:55.688
What did you do, Niles?

04:56.296 --> 04:57.297
How did you rebel?

04:57.297 --> 04:59.458
Oh, the usual ways.
Thank you, Niles.

04:59.799 --> 05:00.857
Like what?

05:01.367 --> 05:03.870
Oh, like what?
Well... uh...

05:03.870 --> 05:06.464
Never happened, Niles.

05:06.539 --> 05:08.336
Your mother and I
kept waiting for it.

05:11.044 --> 05:13.035
I find it hard to believe
that I never...

05:13.546 --> 05:14.447
Nope, nope.

05:14.447 --> 05:16.549
You were one of those good kids.

05:16.549 --> 05:18.518
One time I found
a bag of something

05:18.518 --> 05:21.020
that looked suspicious
in your dresser,

05:21.020 --> 05:22.522
but it turned out
to be something

05:22.522 --> 05:25.024
just to make
your sweaters smell nice.

05:25.024 --> 05:26.526
Well, one time...

05:26.526 --> 05:28.027
Face it, Niles.

05:28.027 --> 05:29.529
You just didn't
have it in you to be bad.

05:29.529 --> 05:30.791
Well...

05:30.963 --> 05:31.520
(gasps)

05:33.366 --> 05:33.730
Freddy, hi.

05:34.434 --> 05:35.435
Listen, I was thinking

05:35.435 --> 05:37.637
maybe we could
take in a movie tonight.

05:37.637 --> 05:40.073
Can't, Dad. I made plans
with my friend Andi.

05:40.073 --> 05:42.508
Your friend Andi
from school is here?

05:42.508 --> 05:44.874
Yeah, visiting relatives.
We're seeing a movie.

05:45.345 --> 05:45.709
(doorbell rings)

05:46.412 --> 05:47.401
But you just got here.

05:47.714 --> 05:49.716
We've got all week, okay?

05:49.716 --> 05:50.705
Be cool.

05:56.422 --> 05:57.357
Hey.
Hey.

05:57.357 --> 05:58.551
Well, see ya.

06:03.396 --> 06:06.092
Well, at least he's not dating
outside the faith.

06:13.473 --> 06:15.475
Excuse me, are you
using this chair?

06:15.475 --> 06:16.776
Wow.

06:16.776 --> 06:18.745
Doesn't that's have
a familiar ring to it.

06:18.745 --> 06:20.446
The weary holiday traveler

06:20.446 --> 06:23.108
and his pregnant wife seeking
kindness from a stranger.

06:23.616 --> 06:24.617
Frasier?

06:24.617 --> 06:26.619
I'm afraid I am, yes. So...

06:26.619 --> 06:27.620
Hi, hi.
Hello!

06:27.620 --> 06:29.110
Hi, come and sit.
Thank you.

06:29.622 --> 06:30.623
I'm so glad I ran into you.

06:30.623 --> 06:32.125
Oh!

06:32.125 --> 06:33.626
Um, cappuccino to go, please.

06:33.626 --> 06:35.128
Oh...

06:35.128 --> 06:37.630
The ad agency
loves the spot.

06:37.630 --> 06:38.619
Oh!

06:39.132 --> 06:41.123
Apparently, they got
quite creative with it.

06:41.634 --> 06:43.136
I'll messenger you a copy.

06:43.136 --> 06:44.137
Oh, that's wonderful news.

06:44.137 --> 06:46.139
Listen, I realize
you're dashing off,

06:46.139 --> 06:49.597
but do you think we could
celebrate tonight over a drink?

06:49.642 --> 06:54.447
Sure. How about, uh...
7:00 at Garagiste?

06:54.447 --> 06:55.106
Could you say that again?

06:55.481 --> 06:56.573
Garagiste. You don't know it?

06:57.083 --> 06:59.085
Oh, yes, I do.
I just love hearing you say it.

06:59.085 --> 07:00.086
(laughing)

07:00.086 --> 07:01.087
Oh, Thank you.

07:01.087 --> 07:03.089
Let me get that for you.
Thank you.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.090
I'll see you then.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.592
Yes, take care.

07:06.592 --> 07:08.082
Hello.
Hello.

07:10.096 --> 07:13.099
Well, that was a yummy
little stocking stuffer.

07:13.099 --> 07:15.101
Yes. She's the one
I told you about;

07:15.101 --> 07:17.103
the girl with the accent.

07:17.103 --> 07:18.604
Oh, yes.

07:18.604 --> 07:20.106
God, she could read me
the phone book

07:20.106 --> 07:22.108
and I would melt
like an overripe Camembert.

07:22.108 --> 07:23.598
Imagine what she
would do with that--

07:24.110 --> 07:26.112
(with accent) :
Camembert.

07:26.112 --> 07:27.113
R-R-R-Roquefort.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.614
Reblochon.

07:28.614 --> 07:30.605
Blu.

07:31.117 --> 07:33.119
We're terrible!

07:33.119 --> 07:35.121
(laughs)

07:35.121 --> 07:36.622
Well, at least it will be nice

07:36.622 --> 07:38.124
to have something to do
this evening, for a change.

07:38.124 --> 07:39.113
Yes.

07:39.625 --> 07:41.115
Is Frederick still
spending all his time

07:41.627 --> 07:43.117
with his little ghoul-friend?
Yes.

07:44.931 --> 07:46.632
They're going to a concert
this evening.

07:46.632 --> 07:47.934
Of course, I don't
begrudge him a social life.

07:47.934 --> 07:49.936
It's just that
I feel so rejected.
Mm.

07:49.936 --> 07:52.638
You know, when one has something
they'd clearly rather do

07:52.638 --> 07:53.639
than spend time with you,

07:53.639 --> 07:54.640
it just feels like...

07:54.640 --> 07:57.109
What the hell are you doing?

07:57.109 --> 07:58.599
I'm sorry.
I'm waiting for someone.

07:59.111 --> 08:00.012
Who?

08:00.012 --> 08:04.016
Well, it really bothered me

08:04.016 --> 08:06.018
when Dad said
that I never rebelled.

08:06.018 --> 08:08.020
I mean, I've been
obsessing about it.

08:08.020 --> 08:10.011
What kind of self-respecting
psychiatrist--

08:10.523 --> 08:12.024
not to mention father-to-be--

08:12.024 --> 08:15.528
completely misses one of life'
prime rites of passage?

08:15.528 --> 08:18.019
So, I've decided
to rebel tonight.

08:21.033 --> 08:23.035
Right under Dad's nose.

08:23.035 --> 08:24.537
How?

08:24.537 --> 08:25.538
You ready?
Yes.

08:25.538 --> 08:27.240
You sure?
Positive.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.174
Move your coffee it might...
Niles!

08:30.576 --> 08:32.567
.
I'm getting high on reefer

08:39.051 --> 08:39.986
What?

08:39.986 --> 08:42.688
I've waited for this
all my life, Frasier--

08:42.688 --> 08:45.691
one act of utter,
devil-may-care,

08:45.691 --> 08:48.694
crotch-grabbing brazenness.

08:48.694 --> 08:50.696
And, of course, I'll have
a nurse on speed dial

08:50.696 --> 08:52.698
in case things get too hairy.

08:52.698 --> 08:54.700
And exactly
which of your connections

08:54.700 --> 08:57.003
in the Seattle demimonde is
going to get you this reefer?

08:57.003 --> 08:58.704
Okay, Niles, you're hooked up.

08:58.704 --> 08:59.693
Well, oh...

09:03.709 --> 09:05.011
Just take a look.

09:05.011 --> 09:08.014
Ah, yes, thick and gooey.

09:08.014 --> 09:10.683
Ganja in its purest form.

09:10.683 --> 09:13.652
It's a pot brownie
, you idiot.

09:13.953 --> 09:16.656
My neighbor makes them.
Oh.

09:16.656 --> 09:17.645
(car alarm blares)

09:17.957 --> 09:18.958
Damn it.

09:18.958 --> 09:19.959
My car alarm again.

09:19.959 --> 09:20.960
I'll be right back.

09:20.960 --> 09:21.961
Wait! But, Niles...

09:21.961 --> 09:23.663
I can'twait.
I got a date.

09:23.663 --> 09:25.665
You're not leaving
that thing with me.

09:25.665 --> 09:26.654
Oh, come on, Frasier,
just give it to Niles.

09:26.966 --> 09:28.668
No, no, no, I refuse.

09:28.668 --> 09:29.969
Stop that. Stop that.
It is illegal.

09:29.969 --> 09:32.672
I will have nothing to do
with it, for God's sakes.

09:32.672 --> 09:34.674
What do you take me for,
some kind of common drug mule?

09:34.674 --> 09:36.976
Mule is one word for it.

09:36.976 --> 09:37.977
Hi, Dad.
How are you doing?

09:37.977 --> 09:39.979
I'll see you back at home.
All right.

09:39.979 --> 09:41.681
Hey, Martin.
Hi, how you doing, Roz?

09:41.681 --> 09:42.982
Good. How are the holidays
treating you?

09:42.982 --> 09:44.684
Cookie?

09:44.684 --> 09:47.676
Oh, no, just trying to stay away
from things that are bad for me.

09:47.987 --> 09:49.989
Well, that's where you and I
are different.

09:49.989 --> 09:51.991
Can you give this to Niles?
He'll be right back.

09:51.991 --> 09:52.980
Yeah, sure.

09:53.693 --> 09:54.990
Uh, coffee to go, please.

09:56.000 --> 10:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:06.672 --> 10:07.969
(sighs)

10:17.683 --> 10:19.981
Mmm... mmm.

10:23.990 --> 10:26.982
Mmm... mmm.

10:38.704 --> 10:40.695
(muffled):
Could I have a brownie, please?

10:47.013 --> 10:48.014
Hey, Dad.

10:48.014 --> 10:50.716
Oh, hey, Niles, um, uh...

10:50.716 --> 10:52.013
Roz wanted me
to give you this.

10:53.719 --> 10:55.016
Thank you.

10:56.722 --> 10:58.724
Hey, uh, you going
to be home tonight?

10:58.724 --> 11:00.726
Yeah, I'm walking home
right now.
Oh, good.

11:00.726 --> 11:03.024
I'll see you there
. Have a nice trip.

11:03.729 --> 11:04.730
You, too.

11:04.730 --> 11:06.732
Oh, I will.

11:06.732 --> 11:09.030
(chuckles)

11:12.738 --> 11:14.729
(gasping)

11:21.013 --> 11:21.881
Hi, Dad.

11:21.881 --> 11:23.212
Hey, Freddy.

11:23.716 --> 11:25.718
Oh, Andi.

11:25.718 --> 11:26.776
How was the mall?

11:26.952 --> 11:28.044
Boring.

11:28.721 --> 11:30.723
Except when that fat kid
threw up in Santa's beard.

11:30.723 --> 11:32.884
That was goth.

11:34.860 --> 11:36.862
Oh, the doorman
had this for you.

11:36.862 --> 11:39.365
Oh, this must be
my tourism promo.

11:39.365 --> 11:40.366
I'll tell you what

11:40.366 --> 11:41.867
Why don't we have
a look at it?

11:41.867 --> 11:44.097
I just came to get a jacket.
We're going to the concert.

11:44.336 --> 11:45.404
Oh, come on, Freddy.

11:45.404 --> 11:47.406
You can spare a couple minutes
to check out

11:47.406 --> 11:48.908
your old man's debut
as a spokesman.

11:48.908 --> 11:51.777
All right, where is
that thing? Here we go

11:51.777 --> 11:54.109
(Frasier's voice):
Anybody want to go for a walk?

11:54.780 --> 11:55.872
Then why not come to Seattle?

11:56.182 --> 11:57.116
Oh, dear God.

11:57.116 --> 11:59.050
Where else can you see...
an ocean wave...

11:59.485 --> 12:02.455
a fish fly, a mountain peak...

12:02.455 --> 12:04.790
and the world's largest needle
?
.

12:04.790 --> 12:07.059
Come to Seattle.

12:07.059 --> 12:08.924
Let's go for a walk.

12:11.764 --> 12:12.898
That is so goth.

12:12.898 --> 12:15.067
It is not goth!

12:15.067 --> 12:16.432
It's outrageous.

12:16.802 --> 12:19.872
It's like some hideous
Frankenstein hybrid of me

12:19.872 --> 12:21.066
and that no-talent dog.

12:21.373 --> 12:22.465
Let's go.

12:22.942 --> 12:23.806
By the way, I'm staying
at Andi's tonight.

12:24.076 --> 12:25.010
What?

12:25.010 --> 12:25.778
At her uncle's.

12:25.778 --> 12:27.507
We have plans all day tomorrow.

12:28.114 --> 12:29.115
I'm sorry, Frederick.
You're not staying anywhere.

12:29.115 --> 12:30.104
until I hear
from her uncle first.

12:30.816 --> 12:32.084
Oh, my God!

12:32.084 --> 12:33.847
I'm sorry,
but that is the rule.

12:34.019 --> 12:35.087
Dad!

12:35.087 --> 12:37.783
I'll meet you
downstairs.

12:40.893 --> 12:41.985
Do you know how much
you're embarrassing me?

12:42.461 --> 12:43.329
What's your problem?

12:43.329 --> 12:44.887
My problem is that you've

12:45.197 --> 12:46.866
hardly spent one minute here
since you arrived.

12:46.866 --> 12:48.026
Now you tell you have plans
all day tomorrow.

12:48.300 --> 12:50.268
You're really making me want
to spend time with you now.

12:51.871 --> 12:53.038
I'd like to know
when you're going to be home

12:53.038 --> 12:54.373
Tomorrow, okay?

12:54.373 --> 12:56.375
I'll have her uncle call you.

12:56.375 --> 12:58.866
I never should have come here
in the first place.

12:59.178 --> 12:59.974
NILES:
Freddy.

13:00.279 --> 13:01.143
Hey.

13:03.582 --> 13:06.152
Hey, Frasier.

13:06.152 --> 13:08.143
What's up?

13:08.854 --> 13:11.846
Just another joyous
holiday moment with my son

13:12.158 --> 13:13.853
to be pasted into my scrapbook.

13:14.059 --> 13:15.127
Ah.

13:15.127 --> 13:17.830
Aren't you going
to ask me what's up?

13:17.830 --> 13:19.127
Didn't intend to, no.

13:19.398 --> 13:22.001
I'd like you to.

13:22.001 --> 13:24.003
All right. What's up?

13:24.003 --> 13:26.372
I am.

13:26.372 --> 13:29.375
I'm as high as the Himalayas!

13:29.375 --> 13:31.366
If I were a city in Germany,
I'd be Heidelberg!

13:31.877 --> 13:32.935
Is Dad home yet?

13:33.245 --> 13:34.246
No.

13:34.246 --> 13:37.249
I'll use this opportunity to up my dosage.

13:37.249 --> 13:40.241
Oh, Niles!

13:40.619 --> 13:42.188
You realize this is illegal?

13:42.188 --> 13:44.890
Did you actually drive
yourself here?

13:44.890 --> 13:46.517
I'm a little too toasted
for that, Frasier.

13:46.959 --> 13:48.527
No, the minute
I knew

13:48.527 --> 13:50.586
I was getting baked tonight,
I called a cab.

13:51.096 --> 13:53.098
And I printed my name
and address on a card

13:53.098 --> 13:55.100
in my pocket
in case I'm still too crispy

13:55.100 --> 13:57.364
to speak to the cab driver
taking me home.

13:57.636 --> 13:59.905
I judge by all this
rich terminology

13:59.905 --> 14:01.974
that you've done some research?

14:01.974 --> 14:04.568
Yes, I know all the symptoms
I can expect to experience.

14:05.044 --> 14:06.545
I'm especially looking forward

14:06.545 --> 14:08.536
to something called
the "munchies" stage.

14:09.048 --> 14:11.550
It's where one enjoys
bizarre food combinations.

14:11.550 --> 14:12.915
I'm thinking of pairing

14:13.152 --> 14:16.952
this Chilean sea bass
with an aggressive zinfandel.

14:18.991 --> 14:21.391
And this is all to prove
a point to Dad?

14:21.894 --> 14:23.262
To Dad and for myself.

14:23.262 --> 14:25.264
Don't I have a right
just once

14:25.264 --> 14:27.960
to sip the sweet nectar
of rebellion?

14:28.167 --> 14:29.134
(keys jingling in lock)

14:29.335 --> 14:30.927
(Martin laughing)

14:37.009 --> 14:39.910
I've got to go
put a jacket on
for my date.

14:40.412 --> 14:43.415
Why don't you see
if you can help Dad
at the door?

14:43.415 --> 14:44.905
(laughing continues)

14:48.420 --> 14:50.422
Hi, Niles.

14:50.422 --> 14:51.411
Funny you should
say that.

14:51.924 --> 14:52.958
Yeah, it is!

14:52.958 --> 14:54.949
(both laughing)

14:58.430 --> 15:01.934
Hey, hey, Niles,
let me ask you something.

15:01.934 --> 15:03.925
Do you ever feel
like you'd just like to go straight?

15:04.436 --> 15:05.437
What?

15:05.437 --> 15:06.927
I was walking home

15:07.439 --> 15:10.442
and I kept thinking about all
the turns we have to make.

15:10.442 --> 15:13.934
Right turn, left turn.

15:14.446 --> 15:16.949
How much easier it'd be
if we just could go straight

15:16.949 --> 15:17.950
over the trees,

15:17.950 --> 15:20.441
over a building.

15:22.354 --> 15:24.356
That's what a giant would do.

15:24.356 --> 15:28.360
They should let everybody
be a giant for a day.

15:28.360 --> 15:30.055
(both laughing)

15:34.366 --> 15:39.065
If you had any idea
how strange you seem
to me right now.

15:40.372 --> 15:44.365
Why is everybody
saying that to me?

15:45.077 --> 15:47.375
By the way,
you are welcome.

15:48.080 --> 15:49.381
Oh... For what?

15:49.381 --> 15:51.283
For turning you on

15:51.283 --> 15:54.286
to the best thing
you will ever eat:

15:54.286 --> 15:58.290
Barbecue pudding chips.

15:58.290 --> 15:59.518
No, thanks.

15:59.992 --> 16:01.360
They looked at me funny
in the store, too,

16:01.360 --> 16:04.352
.
but you taste that and tell me
that's not better than a woman

16:10.035 --> 16:11.570
Do you mind?

16:11.570 --> 16:13.639
Oh, I see.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.140
,
Now you're such a big star

16:15.140 --> 16:17.643
that the whole world
has to revolve around you.

16:17.643 --> 16:18.644
Fine.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.646
I'll tell you what.

16:20.646 --> 16:23.048
You just gloat all you like.

16:23.048 --> 16:25.073
This is not over between us.

16:25.250 --> 16:28.354
Why am I putting
these chips in
this pudding?

16:28.354 --> 16:30.055
Well, I was going
to say.

16:30.055 --> 16:32.057
I should be dumping
the pudding

16:32.057 --> 16:33.046
in with the chips.

16:35.494 --> 16:38.554
I've been having these
great ideas all day.

16:39.064 --> 16:40.065
I wrote some of them down.

16:40.065 --> 16:42.067
Here.

16:42.067 --> 16:44.570
What do you think this means?

16:44.570 --> 16:48.131
"Dog army. "

16:51.377 --> 16:54.079
Oh, that cold medicine
I took this morning

16:54.079 --> 16:55.381
is making me feel funny.

16:55.381 --> 16:57.383
I think I'm going to
go sit down for a while.

16:57.383 --> 16:59.078
Whatever.

17:06.290 --> 17:08.794
Ah...

17:08.794 --> 17:10.352
Anybody want to go for a walk?

17:13.132 --> 17:15.434
Sweet mother!

17:15.434 --> 17:18.404
Where else can you see
an ocean wave...

17:18.404 --> 17:19.393
a fish fly...

17:20.105 --> 17:20.400
a mountain peak...

17:20.839 --> 17:23.433
and the world's largest needle

17:24.108 --> 17:25.711
Come to Seattle.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.541
Let's go for a walk.

17:27.813 --> 17:30.145
Eddie?

17:30.382 --> 17:31.784
FRASIER:
I know what
you're doing.

17:31.784 --> 17:33.218
You're sitting
there thinking
you're the king.

17:33.218 --> 17:35.187
Well, you're not.

17:35.187 --> 17:37.280
Niles?!

17:40.759 --> 17:42.761
All right,
I'm off to my date.

17:42.761 --> 17:44.626
Oh, for heaven's sake.

17:44.863 --> 17:46.331
Niles, that knife
is as sharp as a machete.

17:46.331 --> 17:48.333
You should not not be chopping
with it in your condition.

17:48.333 --> 17:50.324
Do that for him, will you, Dad?

17:54.873 --> 17:59.478
I've come dangerously close
to over-braising my chard.

17:59.478 --> 18:01.613
It's almost as if

18:01.613 --> 18:04.216
something dulled
my motor skills.

18:04.216 --> 18:05.784
You sure you don't want
a little of this on the side?

18:05.784 --> 18:07.786
I can scoop around
the Lucky Charms.

18:07.786 --> 18:10.789
No, thanks.

18:10.789 --> 18:12.518
You know me, Dad.

18:12.758 --> 18:15.327
I'm not much of a rebel.

18:15.327 --> 18:18.763
Too much of a Goody Two-shoes.

18:21.400 --> 18:22.492
Hi, Frasier.

18:24.236 --> 18:26.672
p.
MARTIN:
But you've got to open your mind u

18:26.672 --> 18:28.540
That's where all the great
inventions come from.

18:28.540 --> 18:31.100
Like, it used to be people
would eat too much,

18:31.410 --> 18:33.412
their pants would get tight-- big problem.

18:33.412 --> 18:35.676
Then one day,

18:36.115 --> 18:38.383
somebody said,
"Wait a minute.

18:38.383 --> 18:40.874
Why not put elastic
in them?"

18:47.392 --> 18:48.381
Hi, Fras.

18:48.894 --> 18:51.761
Dad, where are your pants?

18:52.131 --> 18:54.224
In the fridge.

18:56.435 --> 18:59.171
I had a reason.

18:59.171 --> 19:01.469
"Fridge pants. "

19:04.176 --> 19:06.178
Dad, when you were
at the cafe today,

19:06.178 --> 19:07.479
you didn't eat a brownie

19:07.479 --> 19:09.470
that Roz brought
for Niles, did you?

19:10.182 --> 19:11.483
Yeah, but I replaced it.

19:11.483 --> 19:13.185
For God's sake!

19:13.185 --> 19:15.915
That was a pot brownie.
You're stoned off your ass!

19:20.425 --> 19:22.484
Well, someone must feel
pretty out of it

19:23.162 --> 19:26.465
being the only one here
who isn't completely burnt

19:26.465 --> 19:28.267
Oh, knock it off, you imbecile.

19:28.267 --> 19:30.201
You're as sober as I am.

19:31.470 --> 19:32.571
I knew I was
feeling woozy.

19:32.571 --> 19:33.560
I thought it was
that cold medicine

19:34.273 --> 19:34.568
I took this morning.

19:35.274 --> 19:35.941
It's all right, Dad.

19:35.941 --> 19:37.738
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

19:38.243 --> 19:39.244
Dad, are you all right?

19:39.244 --> 19:41.246
Yeah, I'll be fine,

19:41.246 --> 19:43.248
but I better go lie down
before it really hits me.

19:43.248 --> 19:44.750
Come on, boy.

19:44.750 --> 19:46.251
I'll be in the
re in a minute
to check on you.

19:46.251 --> 19:48.242
Oh, suit yourself, Eddie.

19:56.195 --> 19:59.331
Didn't it occur to you
that he was behaving strangely?

19:59.331 --> 20:00.199
I thought it was me.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.700
I thought it was
the Mary Jane talking.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.001
Oh, Niles, please,

20:03.001 --> 20:04.969
will you drop the drug lingo?

20:05.337 --> 20:07.396
Frasier, I feel terrible.

20:07.873 --> 20:08.874
Yes, well, at least

20:08.874 --> 20:11.376
you had a better night
than I did.

20:11.376 --> 20:13.879
Halfway through our date,
Natalie got a phone call.

20:13.879 --> 20:15.380
An emergency at home.

20:15.380 --> 20:16.642
(chuckles ruefully)

20:16.882 --> 20:19.451
I decided to take
a little walk.

20:19.451 --> 20:21.442
20 minutes later I saw her

20:21.954 --> 20:24.445
in a different bar
with another man.

20:24.723 --> 20:26.825
There was no emergency?

20:26.825 --> 20:28.827
Not unless he had
an infected earlobe

20:28.827 --> 20:31.387
which required
an immediate tongue-flicking.

20:33.465 --> 20:35.234
It's beena hell of a Christmas.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.225
I'm so sorry, Frasier.

20:37.536 --> 20:38.537
Truth be told,

20:38.537 --> 20:39.526
I'm most disappointed

20:40.239 --> 20:42.230
about how things
turned with Frederick.

20:42.541 --> 20:44.236
I've just felt us
drifting apart lately,

20:44.543 --> 20:46.306
and I was hoping that...

20:46.812 --> 20:49.679
we could bond again
on this trip.

20:49.881 --> 20:51.883
You may have given him
a wonderful gift

20:51.883 --> 20:54.545
just by letting him
rebel against you.

20:56.288 --> 21:01.360
Something which I am
obviously completely
incapable of achieving.

21:01.360 --> 21:02.861
I'm going home.

21:02.861 --> 21:04.730
You're a good man, Niles.

21:04.730 --> 21:09.292
In a way, isn't that
rebelling against rebellion?

21:09.534 --> 21:11.297
Nice try.

21:12.571 --> 21:15.607
All right, look at it this way.

21:15.607 --> 21:18.371
You did get our cop father
stoned tonight.

21:21.680 --> 21:22.669
I did, didn't I?
Yeah.

21:29.321 --> 21:30.310
Hmm.

21:31.623 --> 21:33.614
Oh, madness!

21:37.095 --> 21:38.357
Frederick.

21:38.630 --> 21:39.898
Hey.

21:39.898 --> 21:41.456
What are you doing home?
I thought you were spending

21:41.933 --> 21:42.422
s.
the night at Andi'

21:42.934 --> 21:43.923
I changed my mind. Good night.

21:44.403 --> 21:47.439
Did something happen
at the concert?

21:47.439 --> 21:48.804
No.

21:49.107 --> 21:51.343
Are you sure?

21:51.343 --> 21:55.347
I can't help noticing
your mascara's run a little.

21:55.347 --> 21:59.647
Andi ran into a "friend"
from her old school.

22:00.118 --> 22:01.653
Ah.

22:01.653 --> 22:04.423
Another boy.

22:04.423 --> 22:06.625
She hardly talked to me
the whole night.

22:06.625 --> 22:11.363
I'm sorry, son.
These things happen.

22:11.363 --> 22:13.365
Well, they always stink.

22:13.365 --> 22:15.060
Did it ever happen to you, Dad?

22:16.935 --> 22:18.926
It may have.

22:19.438 --> 22:20.439
Tell you what.

22:20.439 --> 22:21.940
You know,
I've got a box

22:21.940 --> 22:23.942
of that cereal
you used to like.

22:23.942 --> 22:25.933
What do you say
I pour us a bowl

22:26.445 --> 22:28.947
and I'll tell you
a story or two.

22:28.947 --> 22:30.449
It's happened to you
more than once?

22:30.449 --> 22:32.440
(chuckles)

22:32.951 --> 22:37.411
I'll pour you
a big bowl.
