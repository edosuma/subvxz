00:04.129 --> 00:05.289
Do you remember what Ali said

00:05.324 --> 00:07.058
about secrets keeping us close?

00:07.092 --> 00:08.492
She was wrong.
They tear us apart.

00:08.493 --> 00:10.824
Just like Maya, you were playing me.

00:11.840 --> 00:13.808
I want you to see this.

00:13.842 --> 00:15.810
No.

00:15.844 --> 00:17.511
( Crying )

00:20.382 --> 00:23.250
( Gunshot ) Hanna: Caleb!

00:24.419 --> 00:26.339
Because of you, Garrett
Reynolds is a free man.

00:26.354 --> 00:27.421
Mom, he's out of jail?

00:27.456 --> 00:29.256
Change of plans.

00:29.291 --> 00:30.391
I'll see you soon.

01:04.126 --> 01:08.129
I told them I wanted to do
an art project for Halloween.

01:09.211 --> 01:10.344
They said, "art is fine,

01:10.379 --> 01:13.181
but we don't like to talk
about Halloween in here."

01:13.215 --> 01:15.283
It's supposed to have bad connotations

01:15.317 --> 01:17.985
for some of the patients.
( Thunderclap )

01:18.020 --> 01:20.087
( Soft chuckle )

01:20.122 --> 01:21.856
I guess I see the point.

01:25.761 --> 01:27.895
But I love Halloween.

01:27.930 --> 01:29.931
All the dressing up,

01:29.965 --> 01:32.700
being other people.

01:32.734 --> 01:34.435
Tricks and treats.

01:34.469 --> 01:36.504
Treats that turn into tricks.

01:36.538 --> 01:39.207
It's better than Christmas.

01:39.241 --> 01:40.441
More makeup.

01:49.354 --> 01:54.225
And this is gonna be the best...
Halloween... ever.

01:59.064 --> 02:01.966
I'd bet somebody's life on that.

02:14.998 --> 02:17.133
I will <i>not</i> give you a hint.
We made a deal.

02:17.167 --> 02:19.101
You'll see my costume
tonight at the party.

02:19.136 --> 02:21.871
But what if we end up
wearing the same thing?

02:21.905 --> 02:24.385
We are <i>not</i> going to be wearing
the same thing, I promise you.

02:24.419 --> 02:26.419
Look, I'll give you a hint
if you give me a hint.

02:26.420 --> 02:27.076
No hints, okay?

02:27.110 --> 02:29.030
We said we're gonna pick
somebody from a movie,

02:29.031 --> 02:30.631
and we're all gonna surprise each other.

02:30.632 --> 02:31.814
Whose stupid idea was that?

02:31.849 --> 02:33.115
Yours. Yours.

02:35.752 --> 02:37.820
Em, you sure you want to do this thing?

02:37.855 --> 02:40.122
I want to do this.
I <i>need</i> to do it.

02:40.157 --> 02:42.058
I want something big and splashy to mark

02:42.086 --> 02:43.926
the whole "before"
and "after" of everything.

02:43.961 --> 02:45.828
Symbols and ceremonies?

02:45.863 --> 02:47.830
And plus there's
mystery live entertainment.

02:47.865 --> 02:50.666
Mm-hmm. ( Sighs ) I have
to get to the dentist.

02:50.701 --> 02:52.902
How is Caleb?

02:52.936 --> 02:54.670
He's getting better.

02:54.705 --> 02:56.745
He was easier when he was
in the hospital, though.

02:56.746 --> 02:59.609
Now he's got out, and we
have to go under the radar.

02:59.643 --> 03:01.611
You're sure <i>you</i> want to
go on the ghost train?

03:01.645 --> 03:04.680
Yeah. Otherwise I'm stuck
with my mom and pastor Ted

03:04.715 --> 03:06.515
handing out candy to rug rats.

03:06.550 --> 03:07.783
Your mom <i>and</i> pastor Ted?

03:07.818 --> 03:10.753
Yeah. They're getting
pretty domestic.

03:10.787 --> 03:13.322
I'd tell her to go for it.
My mom moved on.

03:13.357 --> 03:15.324
Oh, my God.

03:15.359 --> 03:17.393
Okay, who would do that?

03:18.741 --> 03:20.475
It's Clifford Yerdley's house.

03:20.510 --> 03:22.578
He's such an astonishing jerk.

03:22.612 --> 03:23.645
Joke's over.

The flowers are for your mom, Spencer,

04:29.279 --> 04:30.946

04:30.980 --> 04:33.081

Yeah. It's time for me
to move on.

04:43.393 --> 04:45.160
I-I gotta get outta here.

04:45.194 --> 04:48.030
Gotta find... closure.

04:48.064 --> 04:49.744
So why don't you start the healing process

04:49.745 --> 04:52.134
by telling me what you know?

04:54.270 --> 04:55.971
You're leaving.

04:56.005 --> 04:57.072
Am I?

04:59.242 --> 05:00.275
Later.

05:00.310 --> 05:02.244
Don't wait too long.

05:09.052 --> 05:10.152
What did he want?

05:10.186 --> 05:11.706
He said he would tell me what happened

05:11.707 --> 05:12.954
the night Alison was killed

05:12.989 --> 05:14.890
and who stole her body if he got off.

05:14.924 --> 05:16.224
Well, did he?

05:16.259 --> 05:17.859
No.

05:17.894 --> 05:19.694
He's not gonna tell me
when we're not alone.

05:19.695 --> 05:21.897
Well, that's not gonna happen.

05:21.931 --> 05:24.032
I'm not gonna leave you
alone with that guy.

05:24.067 --> 05:27.069
You make it so hard
to be a modern post-feminist

05:27.103 --> 05:28.337
when you get so Alpha-male.

05:28.371 --> 05:30.906
Well, you want me to stop?

05:30.940 --> 05:32.040
No.

05:54.097 --> 05:56.898
You kiss pretty good
for a man without a spleen.

05:56.933 --> 05:58.233
I still have it.

05:58.267 --> 06:00.135
They just shot a hole through it.

06:00.169 --> 06:02.304
Remind me again where that scar is.

06:02.338 --> 06:04.306
Oh, yeah. Right there.

06:07.143 --> 06:09.277
Aw... (lndistinct complaint )

06:09.312 --> 06:11.913
All right, this, uh, hiding stuff

06:11.948 --> 06:13.215
is getting really old.

06:13.249 --> 06:14.883
Yeah, tell me about it.

06:14.917 --> 06:16.918
This is my third cleaning
in the last two months.

06:16.953 --> 06:19.054
Well, your gums look great.

06:19.088 --> 06:21.857
I mean, seriously...
everything that's happened,

06:21.891 --> 06:23.959
and we're still in the same place.

06:23.993 --> 06:25.060
No one has heard from "A"

06:25.094 --> 06:27.195
since Garrett got out of jail.

06:27.230 --> 06:29.331
You know, maybe that was the end of it.

06:29.365 --> 06:31.032
Do you want to risk it?

06:31.067 --> 06:33.335
If it was just us, yes,

06:33.369 --> 06:36.204
but we'd be taking chances
for other people.

06:37.340 --> 06:39.074
The ghost train isn't going to be

06:39.108 --> 06:40.242
as fun without you.

06:40.276 --> 06:42.878
It better not be. Well....

06:42.912 --> 06:44.346
Then again, spooky atmosphere,

06:44.380 --> 06:46.148
hot music...

06:46.182 --> 06:48.884
if the right mysterious
stranger comes along,

06:48.918 --> 06:50.952
who knows what might happen?

06:50.987 --> 06:54.222
Maybe... Something like this.

07:13.609 --> 07:14.709
Hi.

07:14.744 --> 07:15.811
Hey!

07:15.845 --> 07:17.913
You almost got a preview

07:17.947 --> 07:19.748
of coming attractions.

07:19.782 --> 07:22.584
Costume for tonight.

07:22.618 --> 07:24.419
We have a problem with tonight.

07:25.572 --> 07:28.340
Wh-what sort of problem?

07:28.374 --> 07:29.641
I... can't go.

07:32.345 --> 07:34.179
Ezra!

07:34.213 --> 07:37.182
I know. I've got...
A meeting in Philadelphia

07:37.250 --> 07:39.284
about ghosting an autobiography.

07:39.319 --> 07:42.988
Actually somebody worth
writing about this time.

07:43.022 --> 07:44.356
It will pay for all of next year.

07:44.390 --> 07:45.924
It has to be tonight.

07:47.226 --> 07:48.894
Oh, crap.

07:48.928 --> 07:50.696
Crap, indeed.

07:50.730 --> 07:52.764

07:52.799 --> 07:55.767
I know you will.

07:55.802 --> 07:58.837
I know. I just... Really
wanted you to see my costume.

07:58.871 --> 08:00.806
Well, I-I can see it tomorrow.

08:00.840 --> 08:03.120
Playing dress-up for your man
on Halloween is one thing.

08:03.121 --> 08:04.409
You do it any other night,

08:04.444 --> 08:06.411
you end up on an afternoon talk show.

08:06.446 --> 08:08.246
Depends on the costume.

08:09.644 --> 08:14.448
And besides, I've got
a little bit of time now.

08:15.483 --> 08:18.385
( Knock on door ) Trick or treat!

08:18.419 --> 08:20.287

Hey! Oh, my... God.
You look amazing.

09:12.830 --> 09:14.931
Oh, no big.
I just put it together.

09:14.965 --> 09:17.734
Barely took six hours.
Who are you again?

09:17.768 --> 09:20.136
Daisy. From the great gatsby.

09:20.171 --> 09:21.838
The movie?

09:21.872 --> 09:22.972
The book.

09:23.007 --> 09:24.908
Right. Where's your author?

09:24.942 --> 09:27.944
( Sighs ) Ezra had to cancel on me.

09:27.978 --> 09:29.879
Great! Well, I mean...

09:29.914 --> 09:32.348
Now I'm not the only one
without a date, so...

09:32.383 --> 09:33.750
Hmm.

09:33.784 --> 09:35.552
You guys on your own?

09:35.586 --> 09:37.253
What a shame.

09:37.288 --> 09:38.421
What are you doing here?

09:38.455 --> 09:40.290
Well, it's nice to see you too.

09:40.324 --> 09:42.524
I thought you always threw
your own Halloween parties.

09:42.525 --> 09:45.094
This year I decided to let
someone else do the work

09:45.129 --> 09:49.032
so I could concentrate
on what's really important.

09:49.066 --> 09:51.935
Oh, you're so sweet. Mmm.

10:00.778 --> 10:03.913
It's just a costume. It doesn't
mean anything anymore.

10:03.948 --> 10:05.715
Hanna: Yeah. Right.

10:17.303 --> 10:19.638
If you need me, just whistle.

10:21.608 --> 10:24.109
You know how to whistle, don't you?

10:24.144 --> 10:26.111
<i>Five minutes until the shuttle</i>

10:26.146 --> 10:27.479

10:27.514 --> 10:29.381
How could you possibly think

10:29.415 --> 10:31.383
that we would be the same thing?

10:31.417 --> 10:33.152
Did Garrett ever come back?

10:33.186 --> 10:35.020
No.

10:35.054 --> 10:36.221
Did you call his house?

10:36.256 --> 10:37.923
His phone's been disconnected.

10:37.957 --> 10:39.792
Where is he? I don't know.

10:39.826 --> 10:42.027
Not bad.

10:42.061 --> 10:44.029
You gotta admit,
I put out a better spread.

10:44.063 --> 10:45.964
You should probably go into catering.

10:49.536 --> 10:50.769

Noel?

11:04.083 --> 11:05.217
Do something!

11:08.955 --> 11:10.022
Oh, my God.

11:10.056 --> 11:12.024
Man: Noel, are you all right?

11:12.058 --> 11:13.098
Please breathe. Calm down.

11:13.099 --> 11:15.060
It's okay.

11:15.094 --> 11:16.374

that you didn't do it?

24:51.618 --> 24:54.620
No, there's more. I went back.

24:57.591 --> 24:59.791
Ali: I'm not the one who makes
people do these things.

24:59.793 --> 25:01.527
If you don't pay for your mistakes,

25:01.561 --> 25:04.096
how can you become a better person?

25:04.131 --> 25:07.166
You say all of these
grown-up things...

25:07.200 --> 25:09.201
But you're still a child.

25:10.517 --> 25:12.551
Don't kid yourself.

25:12.585 --> 25:14.553
You <i>know what I'm capable of.</i>

25:16.222 --> 25:17.389
( Twig snaps )

25:22.195 --> 25:24.363
No! You're lying!
Why would I lie?

25:24.397 --> 25:26.899
No, if you saw that,
why didn't you tell anybody

25:26.933 --> 25:28.834
when you were arrested,
when you were charged?

25:28.868 --> 25:31.388
I would have said something if
your mom hadn't had me cleared,

25:31.389 --> 25:31.869
but she did.

25:31.870 --> 25:32.971
What else did you see?

25:33.006 --> 25:35.674
I didn't stick around.
After he heard me, I left.

25:35.709 --> 25:37.743
She was alive when I left.

25:37.777 --> 25:40.257
I'm gonna go get Aria, and you're
gonna say this to her face,

25:40.258 --> 25:41.547
do you understand?

25:45.785 --> 25:49.354
Stay here.
Where do I have to go?

25:54.694 --> 25:56.662
( Dance music playing )

26:08.942 --> 26:10.876
Hey, have you seen Aria?

26:10.910 --> 26:13.946
Guess what? Look, I'm gonna guess later.
Where's Aria?

26:13.980 --> 26:15.881
I don't know.
I think back there.

26:32.699 --> 26:34.700
( Text indicator rings )

26:38.505 --> 26:42.274
"Guess who's not gonna make it
to the end of the line?"

26:42.308 --> 26:43.408
"A."

27:01.861 --> 27:04.863
( Labored breathing )

27:10.436 --> 27:12.704
( Muffled ) Help! Help!

27:12.739 --> 27:15.474
( Panting )

27:31.594 --> 27:34.630
- I couldn't find her anywhere.
- She's gone?

27:34.664 --> 27:37.299
No, Aria's not gone, you guys.
She has to be on the train.

27:37.333 --> 27:39.368
Unless she's not, anymore.
No. No.

27:39.402 --> 27:41.402
Okay, she's still here.
We just have to find her.

27:41.403 --> 27:44.172
Okay, what about all that
crazy stuff Garrett told you?

27:44.207 --> 27:45.274
What crazy stuff?

27:45.308 --> 27:47.108
Garrett said that he
saw Aria's dad with Ali

27:47.109 --> 27:48.309
the night that she was killed.

27:48.310 --> 27:50.846
We have to find her.
And we believe him?

27:50.880 --> 27:52.080
Why would he lie to us now?

27:52.115 --> 27:54.716
To mess with us.
Everyone's messing with us.

27:54.751 --> 27:56.591
You can get a varsity letter
messing with us.

27:56.592 --> 27:58.392
Okay, but he says
that he has to leave town,

27:58.393 --> 27:59.793
and this is what we needed to know.

27:59.827 --> 28:01.267
Why does he have to get out of town?

28:01.268 --> 28:03.425
'Cause he's afraid
of something, or someone.

28:03.459 --> 28:05.694
Look, nobody can get off the
train while it's moving.

28:05.728 --> 28:08.363
We have to find Aria before we
get to the end of the line.

28:08.398 --> 28:10.465
You guys, "A's" on this train.

28:10.500 --> 28:12.267
We need to find Paige and Toby.

28:12.302 --> 28:14.603
Caleb's on board too.
He surprised me.

28:14.637 --> 28:16.204
Okay, well, you'd better warn him.

28:16.239 --> 28:17.599
I'm gonna keep on looking for Aria

28:17.600 --> 28:18.880
and work my way back to Garrett.

28:27.951 --> 28:29.918

28:53.548 --> 28:57.485
Hey, come here.
We need to talk for a second.

28:57.519 --> 29:00.354
No, seriously. Look,
Garrett's on the train

29:00.389 --> 29:03.290
and we can't find Aria.

29:03.325 --> 29:05.960
Caleb, come on.
Are you listening to me?

29:05.994 --> 29:07.928
We have a situation here.

29:31.820 --> 29:33.554
Good night. Girl: Thank you!

29:33.588 --> 29:34.655
Bye.

29:42.597 --> 29:45.166
Ted, have you seen a little blonde girl?

29:45.200 --> 29:46.360
Yeah, I've seen a lot of 'em.

29:46.368 --> 29:48.602
No, she was in the kitchen.
She wanted to call home.

29:49.900 --> 29:52.668
Uh... nobody came
looking for anybody.

29:52.703 --> 29:54.537
Hm.

30:00.577 --> 30:05.314
( Clattering sound )

( Ashley gasps )

30:11.421 --> 30:14.023
Did you make your call?

30:14.057 --> 30:16.359
I called my mother.
She answered the phone,

30:16.393 --> 30:18.961
but when I asked her to come and get me,

30:18.996 --> 30:21.163
she got really upset and started to cry.

30:21.198 --> 30:23.833
Why is she mad at me?

30:23.867 --> 30:25.968
Maybe you dialed the wrong number.

30:26.003 --> 30:28.604
Bet my sister told her I ran away.

30:28.638 --> 30:29.918
My sister's always telling lies,

30:29.940 --> 30:31.674
getting me in trouble.

30:31.708 --> 30:33.542
We're sisters,

30:33.577 --> 30:36.645
but we fight all the time,
over everything,

30:36.680 --> 30:38.447
even our dolls.

30:39.583 --> 30:42.651
I think she just likes to fight.

30:42.686 --> 30:47.156
Do you think she told my mom
something bad about me?

30:48.291 --> 30:49.358
Um...

30:49.393 --> 30:51.227
( Sharp gasp )

31:03.308 --> 31:05.142
Wait here, okay?

31:05.176 --> 31:06.176
Okay.

31:14.052 --> 31:17.154
Ted... can I see you
up here for a moment?

31:17.188 --> 31:18.655
Sure.

34:05.861 --> 34:06.995
Em telling Paige?

34:07.029 --> 34:09.063
She pretty much knows everything already.

34:09.098 --> 34:11.833
Where's Caleb now? He's at the
front of the train with Toby.

34:11.867 --> 34:13.947
They're gonna work their
way back looking for Aria.

34:13.969 --> 34:16.603
Okay. You okay?

34:16.639 --> 34:18.606
What do you think?

34:18.641 --> 34:20.708
You know what that devil
costume means, don't you?

34:20.743 --> 34:23.378
Yeah, that we weren't fooling anyone.

34:23.411 --> 34:26.447
( Sighs ) They knew Caleb and I were
sneaking around the whole time.

34:28.217 --> 34:30.184
What Garrett said,
do you think that's true?

34:33.806 --> 34:35.341
I don't...

34:35.375 --> 34:36.542
wait a minute.

34:39.646 --> 34:41.347
It's a big girl.

34:41.380 --> 34:43.181
Maybe it's not for a girl at all.

34:45.452 --> 34:48.387
Are we good? Yeah, we're good.

34:48.422 --> 34:51.424
Okay, so you go to the front of the
train, meet up with Caleb and Toby.

34:51.458 --> 34:54.217
We're gonna go back to where I last
saw Garrett and look from there.

No, but she has a thing

not in the house now,

Mmm... about four minutes.

39:42.921 --> 39:44.655
Maybe a little...

39:50.171 --> 39:52.873
The trooper says they're calling parents.

39:52.907 --> 39:55.943
They want to take statements

will be talking to anybody.

Relatively.

40:17.599 --> 40:19.439
Yeah, they wanted
to take me to the hospital,

And, look,

40:20.841 --> 40:22.641
I don't care what Garrett
said about my dad,

40:22.642 --> 40:23.842
he had nothing to do with Ali.

40:23.843 --> 40:25.523
Why would we believe Garrett for a minute?

40:25.524 --> 40:26.540
Okay, straight answer...

40:26.574 --> 40:28.275
"A" killed Garrett, yes or no?

40:28.309 --> 40:30.143
Yes. Yeah, but why?

40:31.245 --> 40:35.082
That was the whole point.
Wh-what point?

40:36.091 --> 40:37.651
That was why "A" pushed us to do things

40:37.652 --> 40:38.960
that would get Garrett cleared.

40:38.994 --> 40:41.514
Yeah, so he could get out of that
jail and "A" could kill him?

40:41.515 --> 40:43.898
Two members of
the N.A.T. Club, dead.

40:43.932 --> 40:47.735
Two people who were in that
room the night Ali was killed.

40:47.769 --> 40:49.070
What do we tell the cops?

40:49.104 --> 40:51.706
As little as possible. They've
already figured something out.

40:51.740 --> 40:53.874
What do you mean? Look at
everyone in this train.

40:53.909 --> 40:55.810
They didn't just place us anywhere.

to do with Garrett Reynolds.

You're okay. You're okay.

41:10.610 --> 41:11.777
What are you doing here?

41:11.811 --> 41:13.879
I-I-I went to
the end of the line

41:13.913 --> 41:15.848
to meet the train, surprise you,

41:15.882 --> 41:18.450
and they said somebody was
hurt, there was trouble,

41:18.485 --> 41:21.320
so I-I drove beside the
tracks until I found you.

41:21.354 --> 41:23.522
You found me.

41:23.556 --> 41:26.458
Yeah. Yeah, I found you.

41:26.493 --> 41:28.660
Why don't you tell the cops you did it

41:28.695 --> 41:30.496
so the rest of us can go home.

41:30.530 --> 41:32.164
You know what? Can it, Noel.

41:32.198 --> 41:33.232
Oh, shut up, Hanna.

41:33.266 --> 41:34.366
No, <i>you</i> shut up.

41:34.401 --> 41:36.335
Stop trying to pull everybody

41:36.369 --> 41:39.138
into every mess you bitches
make for yourselves.

41:39.172 --> 41:40.406
Back off.

41:40.440 --> 41:42.241
Or what?

41:42.275 --> 41:44.176
You don't wanna know, Noel!

41:44.210 --> 41:47.046
( Audible struggle )

41:57.057 --> 41:58.924
( All gasping )

42:08.802 --> 42:10.402
( Gasps )

42:24.384 --> 42:26.418
( Thunderclap )

43:33.148 --> 43:37.709
