the episode, it's realizing that

44:51.707 --> 44:54.274
while she sees him as crazy
and unhinged

44:54.318 --> 44:56.407
at the beginning
of their relationship,

how she would take action
as a result.

that she ditches Josiah

there to die,

seeing Sarah struggle
to breathe,

45:54.334 --> 45:56.249
thinking that Wendell is dead,

45:58.730 --> 46:01.211
of his relationship
with his brother,

46:01.254 --> 46:02.995

with him and who didn't.
