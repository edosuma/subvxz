00:00.626 --> 00:02.992
J woke up this morning j

00:03.045 --> 00:06.287
j same old thing j

00:06.340 --> 00:09.332
j nothing to do j

00:09.384 --> 00:12.547
j; Wait for that horn to ring j

00:12.596 --> 00:16.180
j ring, ring, ring j

00:16.225 --> 00:18.181
let me tell you
something about fame.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.434
There is a moment with fame,

00:23.190 --> 00:24.190
recognition,

00:25.484 --> 00:26.484
and then it's over.

00:28.529 --> 00:32.067
Then you chase it, trying
to stay on that high.

00:34.785 --> 00:37.013
When you get successful, it's
something and you're young,

00:37.037 --> 00:38.527
it's easy to lose perspective.

00:39.915 --> 00:41.267
It's easy to forget
what you were doing

00:41.291 --> 00:42.622
that got you successful,

00:43.877 --> 00:45.708
what inspired you to
become successful,

00:48.257 --> 00:52.045
and that happened to me.

00:52.094 --> 00:56.133
My inspiration was always
the thought of being free.

00:58.350 --> 00:59.350
Free of doubt.

01:00.686 --> 01:04.269
Free of fear

01:04.313 --> 01:06.680
writing songs made life
a little more livable.

01:09.319 --> 01:10.319
Then I lost it.

01:12.072 --> 01:15.439
I lost my voice.

01:16.994 --> 01:17.994
My name is sunny.

01:19.580 --> 01:20.820
And I'm an addict.

01:27.504 --> 01:29.244
Boom, boom, boom, yeanh.

01:29.298 --> 01:30.413
Tyes to me, go.

01:31.425 --> 01:32.380
Go, go, go, spread out.

01:32.426 --> 01:33.882
Lacrosse players
go all the time.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.071
You got push and
start playing lacross.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.095
Go.

01:36.138 --> 01:37.423
Go.

01:37.472 --> 01:39.133
Eyes up, get home.

01:39.182 --> 01:41.514
Concentration, there you go.

01:41.560 --> 01:42.766
There you go!

01:42.811 --> 01:45.097
No walking man, we
don't walk on the field!

01:46.398 --> 01:47.763
What's wrong?

01:47.816 --> 01:49.101
What do you want from this game?

01:50.444 --> 01:51.183
- Hard work.
- Look at me, look at me.

01:51.236 --> 01:52.146
What do you want really?

01:52.195 --> 01:53.105

01:53.155 --> 01:54.235
You wanna get an education?

01:54.281 --> 01:55.191

02:03.290 --> 02:04.780
Looking good Sean.

02:04.833 --> 02:06.539
All that time and
effort, hard work.

02:06.585 --> 02:08.121
Just like your daddy says.

02:08.169 --> 02:09.250
Hard work pays off.

02:09.295 --> 02:11.537
And soft feet don't eat.

02:11.590 --> 02:12.921
- You know what's up.
- Oh really?

02:12.966 --> 02:14.251
You know what's up.

says about that, too?

02:22.142 --> 02:23.348
Right.

02:23.393 --> 02:25.054
I'm hear it in my
mind every single day.

02:25.103 --> 02:26.889
Take care of business, Sean.

Hi.

13:22.427 --> 13:23.792
Sorry, I'm late.

13:26.931 --> 13:28.137
valet couldn't find my car.

13:28.182 --> 13:30.218
And so, there was traffic and,

13:31.102 --> 13:32.888
and the valley here is just,

13:32.937 --> 13:34.723

13:47.744 --> 13:48.744
Okay.

13:51.372 --> 13:52.111
Can I talk to you for a second?

13:52.165 --> 13:53.701
What you wanna know?

13:53.750 --> 13:54.750
I got no money.

13:56.294 --> 13:58.626
I have nothing left.

13:58.671 --> 13:59.671
So get a job.

14:02.258 --> 14:03.589
Let me ask you something.

14:05.094 --> 14:06.334
Hmm.

14:06.387 --> 14:07.823
What happens to our
kids if I get sick?

14:07.847 --> 14:09.428
1 guess you go to the hospital.

14:09.474 --> 14:11.840
- That's funny.
- Yeah.

14:11.893 --> 14:13.599
Pretty good.
I got to the hospital.

14:13.644 --> 14:14.644
But seriously?

14:15.980 --> 14:17.845
You ever think about that?

14:17.899 --> 14:19.389
Hmm?

14:19.442 --> 14:20.442
You should.

14:21.277 --> 14:22.463
Remember what you said earlier

14:22.487 --> 14:24.569
about how you didn't
have a choice.

14:24.614 --> 14:25.353
Yeah, I remember it.

14:25.406 --> 14:26.942
I said it.

14:26.991 --> 14:27.991
Well, guess what?

14:28.868 --> 14:30.324
You had a choice.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.406
And you wanna blame everyone
for where you're at.

14:32.455 --> 14:35.993
But, the choice
was always yours.

14:37.001 --> 14:38.161
You chose to walk out.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.917
You chose to hang it up, right.

14:39.962 --> 14:41.122
You chose to remarry.

14:42.256 --> 14:44.793
I mean, who's choice was that?

14:47.136 --> 14:49.001
I'd lay down in traffic for you.

14:52.558 --> 14:53.558
You know that.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.892
That's the difference
between you and me.

14:56.938 --> 15:00.931
You're you. - And you're you.

15:00.983 --> 15:03.019
- Over here daddy, now!
- Time to go.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.144
- Come on dude.
- Bye.

15:08.116 --> 15:10.698
Oh my gosh, anh.

15:10.743 --> 15:12.388
When making deals with
yourself doesn't work,

15:12.412 --> 15:14.744
you start making deals with god.

15:14.789 --> 15:16.370
That's Jesus.

15:19.961 --> 15:22.077
That's god's son.

15:24.132 --> 15:25.838
Who's god?

15:25.883 --> 15:28.920
God is.

15:32.890 --> 15:34.596
God lives here.

15:34.642 --> 15:35.927
He lives everywhere.

15:36.978 --> 15:39.094
And he sits up in
heaven, look at me.

15:39.147 --> 15:40.762
He sits up in heaven.

15:40.815 --> 15:42.931
And he watches over all of us.

15:45.236 --> 15:46.442
Wow.

15:48.448 --> 15:49.528
Wow.

15:55.121 --> 15:57.077
I pray to god from time to time.

15:58.708 --> 16:00.323
Asking him to give
me the strength.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.080
To get away from this shit.

16:07.133 --> 16:08.213
You wanna make god laugh?

16:09.260 --> 16:10.545
Tell him your plans.

16:14.640 --> 16:15.971
All right, what
do you guys want?

16:16.017 --> 16:17.757
- Oh I'll have a soda.
- And sour patch.

No, I want a bubble gum.

16:39.999 --> 16:43.162
Gum, Popsicle, water, apple.

16:45.588 --> 16:47.148
It only takes a little
crack in the door

16:47.173 --> 16:50.290
before you say let me in

17:01.103 --> 17:01.842

17:18.162 --> 17:19.742
- Okay.
- Learning a new living.

18:02.290 --> 18:03.780
For the nose right?

18:08.212 --> 18:09.076
Is there a phone here?

18:09.130 --> 18:09.915
There's no phone in here.

18:45.374 --> 18:46.489

No girl talk.

19:18.491 --> 19:19.901
There's love all around me.

19:21.952 --> 19:24.113
But if you don't love yourself.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.074
I moved here

19:27.041 --> 19:29.373
With a dream, with a purpose.

19:30.795 --> 19:32.285
I don't know, I just feel like,

19:32.338 --> 19:34.078
I was so happy.

19:34.131 --> 19:35.541

37:20.447 --> 37:22.278
I'm losing everything.

37:23.450 --> 37:25.281

I can't control it, I

She doesn't even know, you know.

38:49.536 --> 38:50.763

38:50.787 --> 38:52.402

We make a decision,
left or right.

39:26.364 --> 39:27.479
Your life is over.

39:29.242 --> 39:31.358
She went to Mexico with her mom.

39:31.411 --> 39:32.992

You need to be fucking

49:19.331 --> 49:21.162
We talked about this

49:21.208 --> 49:24.200
No, if you don't tell me,
that means that you lied.

49:24.253 --> 49:26.995
So that's a lie, isn't

49:52.323 --> 49:53.550
Hey sunny, is everything okay?

Sunny, wake up!

53:30.249 --> 53:31.830

53:33.961 --> 53:35.201
It was a long night, okay?

53:36.463 --> 53:37.953

I don't need to get
trained by you anymore.

54:04.324 --> 54:05.609

Where you going? - Back up!

this, 'cause I miss him, okay?

54:26.847 --> 54:28.257
I miss my dad!

54:29.558 --> 54:31.765
You weren't suppose to leave me.

54:32.686 --> 54:34.472

Except you.

54:37.399 --> 54:38.809

54:42.529 --> 54:43.268
You don't know what
I'm going through.

You think you're gonna
let her train you?

56:22.629 --> 56:24.585
I don't know, maybe.

56:25.507 --> 56:27.372
I meant like are you coachable?

56:29.469 --> 56:30.879
Am I coachable?

56:30.929 --> 56:32.635
You know what, actually,

56:32.681 --> 56:35.423
I think you can be coachable.

56:35.475 --> 56:37.386
I mean, just imagine it.

56:37.436 --> 56:38.767
Hmm, yean.

56:39.980 --> 56:41.891
You can be coachable sunny.

the girl says in the tapes

56:48.238 --> 56:49.603

56:49.656 --> 56:51.192
How about you, how you doing?

56:53.160 --> 56:55.617
Um, I'm good.

56:57.164 --> 56:58.495
I'm kicking ass in school.

56:58.540 --> 56:59.540
Gooaq.

57:00.918 --> 57:03.204
Get a lot of ladies.

57:03.253 --> 57:04.413

57:04.463 --> 57:05.873
- Yeah.

57:05.923 --> 57:07.083
Hmm hmm.

57:07.132 --> 57:08.132
How's your mom?

57:09.301 --> 57:10.541
How's she doing?

57:10.594 --> 57:12.505
Living.

57:13.597 --> 57:15.462
Uh, just.

57:16.558 --> 57:19.925
She's sad.

57:21.271 --> 57:25.731
I don't know sunny, it
just, it just hurts me.

57:25.776 --> 57:28.939
It hurts me to see her
just put a happy face on

57:28.987 --> 57:31.023
everyday like nothing's wrong.

57:32.491 --> 57:34.027
I know something's wrong.

57:37.162 --> 57:38.527
How you doing inside?

57:38.580 --> 57:40.195
- Right here.

57:40.248 --> 57:40.987
In your heart.

57:41.041 --> 57:42.041
Right there.

57:43.251 --> 57:44.661
It's broke sunny, it's.

57:47.714 --> 57:50.171
One half is telling
me to cry out.

57:50.217 --> 57:54.335
And be sad about my
pops, that he's gone

57:54.388 --> 57:58.472
and my mom and shit,
but the other one,

57:58.517 --> 58:02.055
is telling me, Sean you
have to be fucking strong.

58:03.438 --> 58:06.100
You have to be strong
for your mom, your dad.

58:10.696 --> 58:11.696
Right?

58:14.449 --> 58:15.449
Yep.

58:16.284 --> 58:17.284
You re right.

58:21.248 --> 58:22.658
What am I gonna do sunny?

58:24.001 --> 58:25.241
You're doing it.

58:25.293 --> 58:26.908
I'm doing what?

58:26.962 --> 58:28.168
Becoming a man.

58:32.134 --> 58:33.715
That's the cards
you've been dealt bro.

58:50.318 --> 58:52.088
Let's go

58:52.112 --> 58:53.443

59:17.262 --> 59:20.345
Fuck, fuck, fuck,
goddamn it, goddamn it.

59:20.390 --> 59:21.254
Fucking football.

59:21.308 --> 59:23.094
It's not his fault mom, relax.

59:23.143 --> 59:24.679
Sunny boy, sunny, are you okay?

59:24.728 --> 59:25.638
Does it hurt it a lot.

59:25.687 --> 59:26.551
Mom!

59:26.605 --> 59:28.186
It hurts, it fucking hurts!

59:28.231 --> 59:29.459
I broke my fucking kneecap,
what do you fucking think!

59:29.483 --> 59:31.644
- Oh.
- It's hurting bad, okay.

59:31.693 --> 59:33.524
Dammit, there goes
my fucking season.

59:33.570 --> 59:34.797
- It's okay.
- Sunny listen to me.

59:34.821 --> 59:36.466
He drives right to
children's hospital, okay

59:36.490 --> 59:37.400
and I will meet you there.

59:37.449 --> 59:39.280
He broke is fucking knee.

59:39.326 --> 59:41.658
He just had major surgery.

59:41.703 --> 59:43.659
- No shit, I know.
- Wake up sunny.

59:43.705 --> 59:44.911
What is wrong with you?

59:44.956 --> 59:46.059
It's my fault,
what, I injured him?

59:46.083 --> 59:47.368
- Read my lips.
- Stop.

59:47.417 --> 59:49.373
Sunny boy is done with football.

59:49.419 --> 59:51.064
Who the hell are you to
take that away from him?

59:51.088 --> 59:52.088
His mother

59:52.881 --> 59:54.542
take what away from him?

59:54.591 --> 59:56.422
He only plays it 'cause of you.

59:56.468 --> 59:57.878
Thank god he plays this game.

59:57.928 --> 59:59.572
It's the one thing in his
life that makes him normal

59:59.596 --> 01:00:01.086
in this crazy world
that he lives in.

01:00:01.139 --> 01:00:02.424
Is this about you?

01:00:02.474 --> 01:00:03.785
Using your son to...
Oh here you go.

01:00:03.809 --> 01:00:06.300
To just succeed at
something that you failed at.

01:00:06.353 --> 01:00:07.058
I didn't fail.

01:00:07.104 --> 01:00:08.104
Far fucking from it.

01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:10.708
You know, it's one of the
things that made me who I am.

01:00:10.732 --> 01:00:13.018
What is that sunny,
a youth football coach?

01:00:13.068 --> 01:00:15.046
I'm just trying to teach
the kid something about life.

01:00:15.070 --> 01:00:16.276
On.

01:00:16.321 --> 01:00:16.855
Why do you fucking
hate me so much?

01:00:16.905 --> 01:00:18.111
Oh poor sunny.

01:00:18.156 --> 01:00:18.861
Listen to you,
you fucking hate me.

01:00:18.907 --> 01:00:20.067
I do everything.

01:00:20.117 --> 01:00:21.385
I pay for every bill.
Yeah, you do.

01:00:21.409 --> 01:00:24.276
You screw up and I fix
it every fucking time.

01:00:24.329 --> 01:00:25.444
And now you hurt my child.

01:00:25.497 --> 01:00:27.533
So, I'm like an unfit father?

01:00:27.582 --> 01:00:29.789
Look at you.

01:00:29.835 --> 01:00:32.042
Look at you. - Look at you.

01:00:34.756 --> 01:00:36.621
I know you think
I'm a piece of shit.

01:00:36.675 --> 01:00:38.415
Okay, but I ain't dying alone.

01:00:38.468 --> 01:00:40.208
Okay, look in the
fucking mirror.

01:00:40.262 --> 01:00:41.627
Who are you?

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:44.763
Fucking walk around like
you own the fucking place.

01:00:44.808 --> 01:00:45.808
It's a fucking joke.

01:00:45.851 --> 01:00:46.806
No, you know
what's a joke sunny.

01:00:46.852 --> 01:00:48.388
You're the joke. - I'm the joke?

01:00:48.436 --> 01:00:50.516
Well you should fucking
know, you fucking married me.

01:00:51.022 --> 01:00:52.978
You know what else I know?

01:00:53.024 --> 01:00:54.024
Everything.

01:00:54.943 --> 01:00:56.228
Don't think for a second,

01:00:56.278 --> 01:00:57.984
I don't know exactly
what you say about me.

01:00:58.029 --> 01:00:59.360
Yeah, that's right.

01:00:59.406 --> 01:01:00.771
He tells me everything.

01:01:00.824 --> 01:01:02.439
Who?

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:03.803
My friend who happens to
be your fucking boyfriend.

01:01:03.827 --> 01:01:05.179
- Oh he's not boyfriend...
- Finn, remember him?

01:01:05.203 --> 01:01:06.283
He's not my boyfriend.

01:01:06.329 --> 01:01:07.159
- Not this week but...
- Fuck you.

01:01:07.205 --> 01:01:08.285
Fuck me, fuck you!

qualities about you.

01:01:16.882 --> 01:01:17.900
I should just tell him
the fucking truth, man.

01:01:17.924 --> 01:01:19.209
Just to fucking run.

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:22.344
Hey.

01:01:24.973 --> 01:01:26.463
Your kids don't respect you.

01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:28.760
They're embarrassed by you.

01:01:29.769 --> 01:01:31.009
'Cause you re nothing sunny.

01:01:33.565 --> 01:01:34.771
You know what?

You did me the favor the day

01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:43.901
- What are you playing?
- It's a game.

01:01:46.369 --> 01:01:47.609

01:02:07.891 --> 01:02:09.882
It's no big deal, I can go.

01:02:09.935 --> 01:02:11.846
Sunny, Finn's got it.

01:02:13.063 --> 01:02:14.063

01:02:30.914 --> 01:02:32.529
It's my dog Finn, okay.

01:02:32.582 --> 01:02:33.742
I raised that dog.

01:02:33.792 --> 01:02:36.784
I walked that dog, I
take that dog on hikes.

01:02:36.836 --> 01:02:37.575
Me and him.

01:02:37.629 --> 01:02:39.085

You know what else I fucking do?

01:02:41.967 --> 01:02:44.583
I pick up every one
of his shits too.

01:02:44.636 --> 01:02:47.048
S50, I think I deserve to
go to half of my house

01:02:47.097 --> 01:02:48.303
and feed my dog.

01:02:48.348 --> 01:02:49.929
Come on man, sunny!

01:02:51.893 --> 01:02:52.928

01:02:52.978 --> 01:02:54.343
Yeah man, slow

01:02:55.897 --> 01:02:58.229
Do you really wanna
go to war with her?

01:02:58.275 --> 01:03:00.061
I mean, it ain't your fight man.

01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:01.600
Listen to me. - What?

01:03:01.653 --> 01:03:02.984
Think about yourself man.

01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:04.565
Think about getting
this head right.

01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:05.979
Getting back on top.

01:03:06.032 --> 01:03:07.272
It's time.

01:03:07.325 --> 01:03:08.815
What the fuck do you care, Finn?

01:03:08.868 --> 01:03:10.278
- What do I care?
- Yeah?

01:03:10.328 --> 01:03:13.035
I got a fucking phone call
from your ex-wife and you.

01:03:13.081 --> 01:03:14.321
You think I wanted this?

01:03:14.374 --> 01:03:15.784
I just wanted to
date your ex-wife.

01:03:15.834 --> 01:03:18.541
Now, I'm in the middle
like I'm some shrink.

01:03:18.586 --> 01:03:19.586
Okay man.

01:03:24.801 --> 01:03:25.836
You're right.

01:03:27.304 --> 01:03:28.965
I don't care.

01:03:29.014 --> 01:03:30.014
Go feed the dog.

01:03:39.983 --> 01:03:41.939
I couldn't get out of
that hospital fast enough.

01:03:41.985 --> 01:03:43.896
Mmm mmm mmm muanh.

01:03:43.945 --> 01:03:45.310

Hi Fred.

01:03:48.575 --> 01:03:49.575
Hi, hi Fred.

01:03:51.244 --> 01:03:52.825
What are you doing?

01:04:05.425 --> 01:04:06.961

01:04:13.933 --> 01:04:14.933
My other tree.

Too much time by myself
is toxic, I know that.

01:05:49.195 --> 01:05:51.436
It wants to sound gooq,
it wants to sound good.

01:05:51.489 --> 01:05:53.445
It wants to sound good.

Stressed a little bit.

01:09:15.902 --> 01:09:17.267
What?

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:18.319
You look tired.

01:09:24.577 --> 01:09:27.660
I bet, I'm a little
stressed, I was up all night.

01:09:27.705 --> 01:09:29.696
That's understandable.

01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:32.250
What?

01:09:34.504 --> 01:09:36.210
Hang out with

I don't know, just that guy

01:10:31.811 --> 01:10:33.221
and I didn't see you here.

01:10:33.271 --> 01:10:34.289
'Cause you know, I gotta
be honest with you,

01:10:34.313 --> 01:10:35.849
vou look fucking awful.

01:10:38.443 --> 01:10:40.354
When he got out of surgery,

01:10:40.403 --> 01:10:42.234
he was wondering
where his father was.

01:10:43.906 --> 01:10:46.272
So, if you're okay, you're okay.

01:10:46.325 --> 01:10:47.815
Yeah, I'm okay.

01:10:50.329 --> 01:10:51.329
Hey. - Yo, get in.

01:10:54.375 --> 01:10:57.333

Yeah, I'll take three.

01:11:06.053 --> 01:11:07.053
$200.

01:11:07.805 --> 01:11:08.840
Sounds good.

01:11:08.890 --> 01:11:10.346
That's it, I' m done.

01:11:10.391 --> 01:11:12.006
What do you mean you re done?

01:11:12.059 --> 01:11:13.595
I'm done.

01:11:13.644 --> 01:11:15.384
This is the last time
you're gonna see me.

01:11:15.438 --> 01:11:16.473
Nothing personal.

01:11:18.065 --> 01:11:19.065
It's either I die.

01:11:21.986 --> 01:11:23.271
Or I get on with my life.

01:11:24.572 --> 01:11:26.312
- That's pretty fucked up.
- Yeah.

01:11:28.201 --> 01:11:29.201
Good luck.

01:11:30.286 --> 01:11:31.646
Okay sunny.
See you around brother.

01:11:56.771 --> 01:11:58.602
What the fuck am I doing?

01:12:00.107 --> 01:12:01.543
This is the same song
I'm living over and over.

01:12:01.567 --> 01:12:03.023
It's like a merry-go-round.

01:12:04.028 --> 01:12:05.768
I can't get off.

01:12:09.659 --> 01:12:11.512
Hola, it's
Valentina, leave a message

01:12:11.536 --> 01:12:13.026
and I'll call you back.

01:12:13.079 --> 01:12:14.515
There's a voice in my mind

01:12:14.539 --> 01:12:16.746
that supersedes all reason
and that voice wants me dead.

01:12:18.125 --> 01:12:19.706
- Visualize your future.
- It says...

01:12:19.752 --> 01:12:21.037
One more session with darkness.

01:12:21.087 --> 01:12:22.247
One more chat with the devil.

01:12:22.296 --> 01:12:24.912
It's the aarkest
feeling in the world.

01:12:24.966 --> 01:12:26.081
I'm disgusted with myself.

01:12:26.133 --> 01:12:28.340
My skin is crawling with shame.

01:12:28.386 --> 01:12:30.798
I am so sick of who I've become.

01:12:30.847 --> 01:12:32.241
Don't you
think you've had enough?

01:12:32.265 --> 01:12:34.347
I fucking hate myself.

01:12:34.392 --> 01:12:36.303
Help you find your way to you.

01:12:45.403 --> 01:12:46.563
What the fuck are you saying?

01:12:48.072 --> 01:12:50.063
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

01:12:50.116 --> 01:12:51.481
Shut the fuck up, shut up.

01:12:51.534 --> 01:12:53.365
1 can't be around you.

01:12:58.416 --> 01:12:59.371
I miss my dad.

01:12:59.417 --> 01:13:00.748
I don't have anybody.

01:13:00.793 --> 01:13:01.793
Wake up.

01:13:01.836 --> 01:13:02.700
You're fucking wasted.

01:13:02.753 --> 01:13:03.959
You fucking it up,

01:13:04.005 --> 01:13:05.232
'cause that's what
it looks like.

01:13:05.256 --> 01:13:07.292
You are running
out of fucking money.

01:13:07.341 --> 01:13:09.548
Can't you die you little shit?

01:13:09.594 --> 01:13:10.714
Your kids don't respect you.

01:13:13.472 --> 01:13:14.912
Dad, don't get in
this mode, come on.

01:13:19.145 --> 01:13:21.978
Sunny, wake
your fucking ass up now!

01:13:26.402 --> 01:13:28.438
Fuck it.

01:13:28.487 --> 01:13:29.487
Oh fuck it.

01:13:39.749 --> 01:13:40.749
Fuck it.

01:14:09.737 --> 01:14:13.446
When I stare at myself in the
mirror, I don't see myself.

01:14:17.536 --> 01:14:18.571
Who are you?

01:14:42.687 --> 01:14:44.018
You re not here.

01:14:44.063 --> 01:14:44.927

01:14:44.981 --> 01:14:45.720
What are you doing?

01:14:45.773 --> 01:14:47.388
You're not here.

01:14:47.441 --> 01:14:48.919
I know I'm fucked up right
now, but you're not here.

01:14:48.943 --> 01:14:50.604
What the fuck are you doing man?

01:14:50.653 --> 01:14:51.438
I don't have to listen to you.

01:14:51.487 --> 01:14:52.487
Put the belt down.

01:14:54.073 --> 01:14:56.189
You're gonna do this
to your family sunny?

01:14:57.660 --> 01:14:58.660
The family you love?

01:15:00.037 --> 01:15:01.277
You re not here.

01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:03.286
Don't look at me like that.

01:15:03.332 --> 01:15:04.447

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:06.365
- Sunny.

01:15:06.419 --> 01:15:07.625
You're fucking giving up!

01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:09.080
You don't know man!

01:15:10.715 --> 01:15:12.546

In angel's room, you're
gonna hang yourself?

01:15:19.682 --> 01:15:22.549
You're gonna have her
come in and find you dead?

01:15:22.601 --> 01:15:23.636
That's what you want?

01:15:23.686 --> 01:15:26.177
No, I don't want, I have to.

01:15:26.230 --> 01:15:27.470
Well do it all the way, man.

01:15:27.523 --> 01:15:28.888
One belt, what if

01:15:28.941 --> 01:15:30.351
Why don't you get

01:15:30.401 --> 01:15:31.686

You're not my friend.

01:16:05.478 --> 01:16:06.217
Don't say that.

01:16:06.270 --> 01:16:08.181
You're not my friend.

01:16:09.732 --> 01:16:11.142
Knock yourself out.

01:16:22.578 --> 01:16:24.694
Come on. - Leave me alone.

01:16:24.747 --> 01:16:27.534

01:17:24.223 --> 01:17:25.258
Stupid man.

01:17:26.767 --> 01:17:27.767
Little angel.

01:17:31.814 --> 01:17:32.814
Sunnyboy.

01:17:35.025 --> 01:17:36.390
Leave me alone.

01:18:19.778 --> 01:18:21.439
You look like shit.

01:18:22.531 --> 01:18:23.737
You didn't fucking hear me?

01:18:28.037 --> 01:18:32.576
You didn't hear me calling,
called 30 fucking times sunny.

01:18:32.625 --> 01:18:34.661
And then when you
didn't answer the phone,

01:18:34.710 --> 01:18:37.918
I came over here as
quick as I could.

01:18:41.675 --> 01:18:42.790
Are you fucking okay?

01:18:44.178 --> 01:18:45.293
Yeah, I'm all right.

01:18:47.848 --> 01:18:48.883
You know.

01:18:50.434 --> 01:18:51.799
If you don't straighten up,

01:18:51.852 --> 01:18:53.888
you're gonna fucking
kill yourself, okay,

01:18:53.938 --> 01:18:54.938
it's getting obvious.

01:18:56.482 --> 01:18:58.598
Okay, just listen
to me for a second.

01:18:58.651 --> 01:18:59.356
You listen to me.

01:18:59.401 --> 01:19:00.937
Shut up, listen to Mel

01:19:00.986 --> 01:19:02.726
okay, I'm done listening to you.

01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:03.815
I'm fucking done.

01:19:05.115 --> 01:19:06.115
Okay.

01:19:07.368 --> 01:19:09.359
Everybody is worried about you.

01:19:12.748 --> 01:19:14.864
I gotta call from Finn.

01:19:14.917 --> 01:19:16.532
You know what he said?

01:19:16.585 --> 01:19:17.896
He said that when you were
at the hospital yesterday,

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:20.707
Damon said, you looked
like you were wacked.

01:19:20.756 --> 01:19:22.121
Were you wacked?

01:19:22.174 --> 01:19:23.664
Wacked at the hospital?

01:19:25.803 --> 01:19:26.918
I did not say that.

01:19:26.971 --> 01:19:28.177
What I said is you look tired,

01:19:28.222 --> 01:19:29.616
you looked distressed,
you looked distraught,

01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:30.971
you looked haggard, you do.

01:19:32.935 --> 01:19:33.799
You look like shit.

01:19:33.852 --> 01:19:35.467
Everyone's worried about you.

01:19:35.521 --> 01:19:36.977
You don't look like you.

01:19:41.944 --> 01:19:45.903
I love you like I wish 1
loved my actual brothers.

01:19:48.659 --> 01:19:49.944
Okay?

01:19:49.994 --> 01:19:51.325

01:19:54.707 --> 01:19:56.368
It's all right guys, I get it.

01:19:56.417 --> 01:19:58.032
Bring it in, let's
do this thing.

01:20:05.592 --> 01:20:06.957
What's up buday?

01:20:07.011 --> 01:20:11.050
All right, full disclosure,
t was a full-on addict.

01:20:11.098 --> 01:20:13.965
You know, I was snorting
coke, I was shooting up.

01:20:14.018 --> 01:20:15.383
I was drunk all the time.

01:20:16.895 --> 01:20:19.637
Spent the first year of
my kids' life in rehab.

01:20:19.690 --> 01:20:21.806
And I'm telling you
this sunny, 'cause,

01:20:24.528 --> 01:20:26.314
I feel like you
need some help and,

01:20:27.906 --> 01:20:29.021
I've been down that,

01:20:29.825 --> 01:20:31.736
that long, dark,

01:20:33.704 --> 01:20:36.946
shitty road and I'm
not judging you, okay.

01:20:36.999 --> 01:20:39.661
But buddy, drugs or no
drugs, you are lost.

01:20:40.878 --> 01:20:42.789
And you're sinking fast, man.

01:20:42.838 --> 01:20:44.874
You're at the point
where you're giving up.

01:20:44.923 --> 01:20:46.459
And we all see this.

01:20:46.508 --> 01:20:48.840
But you gotta make the decision,
you gotta make the choice

01:20:48.886 --> 01:20:50.422
and you gotta do it now.

01:20:50.471 --> 01:20:52.007
'Cause you re either gonna die

01:20:53.766 --> 01:20:56.599
or youre gonna reach out
and start pulling yourself up

01:20:56.643 --> 01:20:57.643
and let us help you.

01:21:00.272 --> 01:21:01.833
I don't know, we just
don't wanna see you

01:21:01.857 --> 01:21:04.690
do anything you can't
come back from, you know?

01:21:04.735 --> 01:21:05.850
You know how I feel man.

01:21:09.073 --> 01:21:09.858
I fucking love you brother.

01:21:09.907 --> 01:21:10.987
I love you too.

01:21:12.534 --> 01:21:15.401
Sunny, you still
have it, I know that.

01:21:20.250 --> 01:21:21.865
Fuck the house.

01:21:24.713 --> 01:21:25.793
That's what I said.

01:21:27.091 --> 01:21:30.174
New house, new life.

01:21:30.219 --> 01:21:31.219
Okay?

01:21:35.015 --> 01:21:36.015
Thank you.

01:21:37.893 --> 01:21:38.893
Thank you all.

01:21:44.566 --> 01:21:48.104
J who was around when we
had a dollar to our name j

01:21:48.153 --> 01:21:51.896
j we didn't care much for
the fortune or the fame j

01:21:51.949 --> 01:21:53.940
j we were just keeping law j

01:21:53.992 --> 01:21:56.028
j we knew the good lora
would get us through j

01:21:56.078 --> 01:21:58.364
when the emotions, the
pain became too much,

01:21:59.915 --> 01:22:01.997
the thoughts of death and
dying found their home.

01:22:03.335 --> 01:22:04.370
What I realized?

01:22:05.504 --> 01:22:07.745
Death is not the
greatest loss in life.

01:22:09.007 --> 01:22:10.998
To me the greatest loss
is what dies inside you

01:22:11.051 --> 01:22:12.131
while you're still alive.

01:22:13.637 --> 01:22:15.468
You don't like something?

01:22:15.514 --> 01:22:16.514
Change it.

01:22:17.349 --> 01:22:18.714
And if you can't change it,

01:22:18.767 --> 01:22:20.382
change the way you
think about it.

01:22:23.981 --> 01:22:26.017
[T's okay to ask for help.

01:22:26.066 --> 01:22:28.773
Everybody needs help at
some point in their life.

01:22:28.819 --> 01:22:32.186
& cause we all
live, we all die j

01:22:32.239 --> 01:22:35.402
j but it hurts if we don't try j

01:22:35.451 --> 01:22:36.451
my epiphany?

01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:39.155
I ove.

01:22:40.414 --> 01:22:42.621
It took someone yanking
me out of my black cloud

01:22:42.666 --> 01:22:44.657
and shaking me with love.

01:22:44.710 --> 01:22:46.075
Letting me know they loved me.

01:22:47.004 --> 01:22:48.289
Unconditionally.

01:22:48.338 --> 01:22:51.956
J I can't be what this
world wants of me j

01:22:52.009 --> 01:22:53.840
I don't claim to
have all the answers.

01:22:55.262 --> 01:22:56.798
But I do know I have today.

01:22:59.641 --> 01:23:01.051
Watch after my boy.

01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:04.520
Be there for him.

01:23:06.148 --> 01:23:07.183
See me soon.

01:23:09.735 --> 01:23:12.693
S we keep marching strong
and helping those we see j

01:23:12.738 --> 01:23:14.478
I love you sunny.

01:23:14.531 --> 01:23:18.149
You're a special dude,
man, remember that.

01:23:19.161 --> 01:23:21.322
I mean, man, live for

Yeah.

01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:29.000
That's what I want.

01:23:30.881 --> 01:23:35.170

We have our differences, we...

01:23:52.027 --> 01:23:54.985
I want you to know something.

01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:56.270
I would do anything for you.

01:23:59.159 --> 01:24:02.242
Regardless of what I said
to you or anybody else,

01:24:03.956 --> 01:24:05.571
I am always there for you.

01:24:10.254 --> 01:24:11.334
Look what we made in there.

01:24:14.049 --> 01:24:15.755
Pretty special hun?

01:24:15.801 --> 01:24:17.132
And that's forever

01:24:21.557 --> 01:24:24.594
I love you.

01:24:24.643 --> 01:24:26.008
I'm really glad you're okay.

01:24:33.193 --> 01:24:35.104
Mmm, how you feeling?

01:24:37.406 --> 01:24:38.771
- Good.
- Yeah?

01:24:40.284 --> 01:24:41.284
How you feeling?

01:24:42.327 --> 01:24:43.327
I'm good.

01:24:44.621 --> 01:24:45.701
You look different.

01:24:47.291 --> 01:24:48.291
I bet.

01:24:51.503 --> 01:24:53.209
I wanna read something to you.

01:24:53.255 --> 01:24:54.119
Is that okay?

01:24:54.172 --> 01:24:56.914
Yeah.

01:24:56.967 --> 01:24:57.967
Better yet.

01:25:02.180 --> 01:25:03.295
How about you read it?

01:25:05.142 --> 01:25:06.142
- Okay.
- Jules.

01:25:07.352 --> 01:25:10.719
Come up here.

01:25:14.151 --> 01:25:15.186
Now?

01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:18.311
Whenever you're
ready, go for it.

01:25:20.574 --> 01:25:23.031
I don't even know
where to start.

01:25:23.076 --> 01:25:26.819
[Sunny and sunnyboy I
so I'll just in.

01:25:26.872 --> 01:25:29.454
I'm bringing all the positive
things back in my life.

01:25:30.417 --> 01:25:31.532
Shedding all the fat.

01:25:32.711 --> 01:25:35.123
I lost the fight that I once had

01:25:35.172 --> 01:25:37.003
after a failed marriage and,

01:25:39.092 --> 01:25:40.548
being away for so long, I just,

01:25:44.389 --> 01:25:46.345
I just dian't want to
chase the race anymore.

01:25:47.309 --> 01:25:49.015
Fame, fortune, all that shit.

01:25:51.146 --> 01:25:52.181
So I hung it up

01:25:54.316 --> 01:25:55.431
to be with you guys.

01:25:57.235 --> 01:25:59.396
10 raise you guys, to
take you to school.

01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:01.611
Coach your sports.

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:04.861
Watch all your
great performances.

01:26:08.246 --> 01:26:09.736
And I raised you two to be,

01:26:12.292 --> 01:26:14.374
great people, special.

01:26:16.296 --> 01:26:17.296
At least I think.

01:26:20.509 --> 01:26:22.625
I lost a sense of myself.

01:26:22.678 --> 01:26:26.170
I lost, a sense of who I was.

01:26:28.392 --> 01:26:33.352
Oh man, I was just, I've been
down on myself for so long.

01:26:34.314 --> 01:26:37.431
Almost 10 years, I was
circling the drain.

01:26:41.196 --> 01:26:42.356
I almost gave up.

01:26:44.908 --> 01:26:46.114
If there was an off switch,

01:26:46.159 --> 01:26:47.559
I probably would
have turned it off.

01:26:50.288 --> 01:26:53.200
But somehow and
someway, I didn't.

01:26:55.377 --> 01:26:58.210
Now it's time to get back up.

01:26:58.255 --> 01:26:59.836
It's time to get
back in the world,

01:26:59.881 --> 01:27:01.337
be present in my life.

01:27:05.804 --> 01:27:08.216
I've always loved
you guys so much.

01:27:08.265 --> 01:27:09.550
You re everything to me.

01:27:11.810 --> 01:27:13.095
Life is too short.

01:27:18.984 --> 01:27:21.771

to see me in my best.

01:27:53.977 --> 01:27:55.888
How you doing buddy?

01:27:55.937 --> 01:27:58.895

How are you doing?

01:28:02.986 --> 01:28:03.986
I'm really good.

01:28:04.696 --> 01:28:07.062
Yeah, I can see that.

01:28:08.575 --> 01:28:09.575
Yeah.

01:28:11.828 --> 01:28:13.318
Something's different about you.

01:28:14.581 --> 01:28:17.243
It's in your eyes, I can
see it all in your eyes.

01:28:17.292 --> 01:28:18.782
You look like the old sunny.

01:28:20.587 --> 01:28:21.587
Are you back?

01:28:26.551 --> 01:28:28.917
Dad said you'd be back.

He did?

01:28:30.096 --> 01:28:31.096
Yeah.

01:28:33.391 --> 01:28:35.723
You know, I was waiting this
entire time for you, right?

01:28:39.356 --> 01:28:40.596
That's what friends do.

01:28:44.402 --> 01:28:45.938
I gotta take a shower man.

01:28:45.987 --> 01:28:47.272
Go do your homework.

01:28:47.322 --> 01:28:48.482

01:29:49.509 --> 01:29:51.340
- 2:30.
- Love ya.

01:29:51.386 --> 01:29:52.501
I love you too, man.

01:29:59.352 --> 01:30:01.764
It was all worth it, you know?

01:30:01.813 --> 01:30:02.813
Everything.

01:30:03.940 --> 01:30:05.396
I own it all.

01:30:23.752 --> 01:30:25.617
How's everybody doing tonight?

01:30:28.548 --> 01:30:29.708
It's really good to be back.

01:30:32.218 --> 01:30:33.424
You ready to get down tonight?

01:30:41.144 --> 01:30:42.975
Why don't we just do this thing?
