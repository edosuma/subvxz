WEBVTT

00:02.700 --> 00:04.300
these are intense.
Are any of these yours?

00:04.400 --> 00:07.800
No, they're my grad students'
from my masters portfolio class.

00:08.100 --> 00:10.800
Wow, you really look beautiful in this light.

00:11.100 --> 00:14.600
Wishful thinking on both our parts.
It's a model, not me.

00:14.900 --> 00:16.500
Some photos down there you might enjoy.

00:16.700 --> 00:18.500
Student of mine was in bangladesh.

00:18.600 --> 00:21.000
Well, I'll tell you what I used to tell my mother
when I didn't finish my dinner--

00:21.100 --> 00:23.900
I don't care about kids from india,
I just care about you.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
I didn't say the last part to my mother.
That'd be weird.

00:26.100 --> 00:28.300
- Although I'm sure she was fascinating.
- She was, very.

00:28.400 --> 00:30.800
But no mother issues here at all.

00:33.900 --> 00:35.100
These have to be yours.

00:35.200 --> 00:37.400
This is, uh, what,
your apartment down in the east village?

00:37.500 --> 00:39.300
Do you miss it, the whole bohemian lifestyle?

00:39.400 --> 00:41.100
No, I like teaching here just fine.

00:41.200 --> 00:43.500
How come there's no pictures of you here at all?

00:43.600 --> 00:44.600
Come on, rick.

00:44.700 --> 00:47.200
It's the command performance for the new dean.
We're already late.

00:47.600 --> 00:50.000
Ok. So much for small talk.

00:51.600 --> 00:52.600
This is amazing.

00:52.700 --> 00:55.300
Just 'cause the dean is former ivy,
they rent out an entire restaurant.

00:55.400 --> 00:57.000
You know what I got when I came to rockland U.?

00:57.100 --> 00:59.600
I got a welcome packet with a few take-out menus.

00:59.700 --> 01:01.000
Professor pollili.

01:01.100 --> 01:04.200
Hi. I'm stacey adler. Not that it matters.

01:04.300 --> 01:08.100
I know your work. I've tried to get into
your classes, but they fill up so fast.

01:08.200 --> 01:10.800
Well, it's very nice to meet you, stacey.
This is professor payne.

01:10.900 --> 01:13.000
Oh, great. 
I'm going to get the spelling in just a sec.

01:13.200 --> 01:14.300
Oh, no, please.

01:14.400 --> 01:17.000
Oh, it's just a P.R. Picture 
for the university magazine.

01:17.100 --> 01:18.300
No. I said no.

01:19.200 --> 01:21.200
I'm sorry. I just-- please, don'T.

01:21.300 --> 01:23.900
Ok. I'm-- I didn't realize. Sorry.

01:24.700 --> 01:26.100
I can't do this.

01:26.500 --> 01:28.700
- I thought I could, but I can'T.
- What? What can't you do?

01:28.800 --> 01:30.500
Look, it's not you. I just--

01:30.600 --> 01:33.300
I really don't feel well,
so I'm going to go. Um...

01:36.000 --> 01:38.600
- that is weird.
- Yeah, that's weird.

01:38.700 --> 01:41.800
I know. I had her right in frame.

01:42.200 --> 01:46.100
Wow. That is weird.
Can I borrow this for a second?

01:46.200 --> 01:47.500
Actually, like, right now, this second.

01:47.600 --> 01:50.100
It's ok. I'm a professor.

01:53.500 --> 01:56.600
- Ok. Thank you very much.
- Wait. Why?

01:56.900 --> 02:00.400
Because you just gave your memory card
to the anthropology department.

02:00.500 --> 02:01.700
I appreciate it.

02:01.800 --> 02:03.700
But--wh-what about the magazine?

02:03.800 --> 02:07.700
Use your descriptive powers.
Why, you know, cheat with pictures?

02:11.900 --> 02:13.200
Hello!

02:13.300 --> 02:15.700
I know you guys are home. I can see your cars.

02:15.800 --> 02:17.800
- Are you expecting someone?
- No one!

02:17.900 --> 02:19.200
Hello?

02:19.300 --> 02:21.100
Hello, hello, hello!

02:21.900 --> 02:24.000
Hello.

02:24.300 --> 02:25.700
Hey. How are you, jim?

02:25.800 --> 02:27.500
You been working out? You look good.

02:27.600 --> 02:30.300
There she is.
Ahh. This is nice.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.800
There's the missus, a nice crackling fire.

02:32.900 --> 02:36.200
Nice vintage-- a little pricey.
"Scrupulistic" not a word.

02:36.300 --> 02:37.400
Didn't you have a date tonight?

02:37.500 --> 02:38.700
I did have a date tonight,

02:38.800 --> 02:42.200
as it were, since you're the one that
forced me back into the dating world.

02:42.400 --> 02:45.100
- What happened?
- Well, what happened? I'll tell you what happened.

02:45.200 --> 02:46.641
This might have been the first time in my life 

02:46.741 --> 02:51.801
that a woman said
 "it's not you, it's me," and I believed her.

02:51.900 --> 02:52.900
Let me find these for you.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.400
Oh, here's professor reeman, russian studies.

02:55.500 --> 02:58.300
He just got published... again.

02:58.500 --> 03:00.100
Ok. Oh, here we are. Ok. That's me.

03:00.200 --> 03:03.200
Wow. This really is...a damn fine suit.

03:03.300 --> 03:06.100
That's me, and next to me,
that's where my date should be.

03:06.200 --> 03:08.500
That big, empty space, that's where my date was. Ok?

03:08.600 --> 03:11.000
Here's another one.
That's me sitting next to...

03:11.100 --> 03:13.600
ehh, no one. Nothing's there. Ok.

03:13.700 --> 03:16.900
Oh. Here's claudia's exit, 
which was abrupt, to say the least,

03:17.000 --> 03:19.500
although you can't see it on any of these photos

03:19.600 --> 03:20.900
'cause apparently, she doesn't exist.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.500
Let me take a look at that.

03:22.600 --> 03:24.500
So she's not showing up in any of the photos.

03:24.600 --> 03:27.200
Just admit it, melinda--
tonight, I got dumped by a ghost.

03:27.400 --> 03:29.700
- Does she even exist?
- Yes. She has tenure.

03:29.800 --> 03:32.800
It's publish or perish.
Her photographs are published everywhere.

03:32.900 --> 03:34.300
But she's not in any of them,

03:34.400 --> 03:37.000
and nor have I seen her
in any of her personal photography,

03:37.100 --> 03:39.700
and the photos she has of herself on her desk
with her family and things--

03:39.800 --> 03:41.500
nothing. She's not in any photos.

03:41.600 --> 03:42.800
Well, that's weird.

03:42.900 --> 03:46.600
I mean, maybe it's something about her energy,
or something the camera can't capture.

03:46.700 --> 03:50.700
I don't think so. Paranormal occurrences
usually work the opposite way.

03:50.800 --> 03:55.500
Spirits are visible in photographs
because cameras detect light and heat.

03:55.600 --> 03:59.300
But a broader spectrum of energy
the human eye can't detect.

03:59.400 --> 04:00.100
Kind of like that?

04:00.500 --> 04:03.300
Ok. I've never seen this before.

04:03.500 --> 04:05.200
Hang on a second.

04:05.400 --> 04:07.100
It's with her in every shot.

04:07.200 --> 04:09.400
For the record, that's not who I asked out.

04:09.500 --> 04:11.300
Maybe not, but...

04:11.400 --> 04:13.600
that's who went home with her.

04:48.800 --> 04:53.000
I've been looking for occurrences of images
being erased from a photograph.

04:53.100 --> 04:54.100
They're hard to find.

04:54.200 --> 04:56.800
I mean, ghosts popping up, stealing the spotlight?

04:56.900 --> 05:01.700
I mean, they're a dime a dozen.But
somebody actually being knocked from the frame?

05:01.800 --> 05:03.800
That's-- that's unusual.

05:03.900 --> 05:07.100
I'm more interested in the
shape we saw following claudia.

05:07.400 --> 05:09.500
Oh, him. Yeah. Let's call him bob.

05:09.700 --> 05:11.400
Ok. Bob. Why?

05:11.500 --> 05:15.000
'Cause bob riker got my prom date
drunk on peach schnapps.He stole her from me.

05:15.100 --> 05:17.400
Now they're married with 3 kids,
but I don't think they're happy.

05:17.500 --> 05:19.300
Sad. But you've moved on to claudia.

05:19.400 --> 05:20.900
Does she have any idea what happened to her?

05:21.000 --> 05:23.200
Well, she flipped out the second
a camera was pointed at her,

05:23.300 --> 05:26.000
and, well, I'm no expert in composition,

05:26.100 --> 05:29.600
but it sure seems like all the pictures
in her office are kind of lopsided.

05:29.700 --> 05:32.300
- Like she used to be in them?
- More like bob riker took them.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.400
Can a ghost do that?

05:33.500 --> 05:36.500
I mean, transform an existing image or print?

05:36.600 --> 05:40.000
Well, it would help if he had
basic knowledge of photographic principles--

05:40.100 --> 05:43.200
I mean, knowing how light and heat affect pigment.

05:43.300 --> 05:45.600
A photograph is just pixels and colors.

05:45.700 --> 05:48.900
So in theory, he could move them all around
like the piece on an ouija board.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.200
You said he. Is this bob?

05:50.300 --> 05:51.300
No, I'm talking about kevin.

05:51.400 --> 05:54.200
Kevin was one of claudia's graduate students.
He died 2 weeks ago.

05:54.300 --> 05:57.800
And you're just telling me this now?
That is, like, plain withholding.

05:57.900 --> 05:59.600
- What happened to him?
- He died in a car crash.

05:59.700 --> 06:02.600
But I didn't even know until this morning
when I called claudia-- which, by the way,

06:02.700 --> 06:07.000
I was completely breaking my "don't call anyone
for 48 hours after a disastrous date" rule.

06:07.300 --> 06:09.600
I can't imagine how that
came up in a conversation.

06:09.700 --> 06:13.800
Actually, a pretty smooth segue from
"hey, do you know you're invisible?"

06:16.400 --> 06:19.600
That's what makes it a great photograph,
that's the unspoken narrative.

06:19.800 --> 06:21.300
It tells a story.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.900
I will have extended office hours this afternoon,
ok?

06:24.000 --> 06:26.500
But I need to talk to these people.
And joseph, congratulations.

06:26.600 --> 06:28.800
Oh, seriously, professor pollili,
I can't thank you enough.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.300
See you later.

06:30.900 --> 06:33.100
- Hi. I'm claudia.
- Hi. Melinda.

06:33.200 --> 06:34.800
The friend I was telling you about.

06:35.600 --> 06:36.800
What happened to your forehead?

06:36.900 --> 06:39.900
Oh, I was driving home last night
and I clipped a parked car.

06:40.900 --> 06:43.100
- Lucky nobody was hurt.
- Except for you.

06:43.400 --> 06:45.300
Mmm. I don't know where I'm at these days.

06:47.100 --> 06:51.600
All I know is, I came home one day to find
I wasn't in any pictures.

06:51.800 --> 06:53.600
Family, friends, travel--

06:53.700 --> 06:56.800
the photos were still there, but I was gone.

06:57.700 --> 06:59.200
What day was that, exactly?

06:59.300 --> 07:01.700
It was the day after kevin graham died.

07:01.800 --> 07:03.400
Your student.

07:03.500 --> 07:05.900
He died in a car crash.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.400
So talented. Nicest guy.

07:08.500 --> 07:12.600
Last night, did you feel anything strange,
like a presence?

07:12.900 --> 07:14.000
I don't think so.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.800
How well did you know kevin?

07:16.500 --> 07:19.400
Was there any reason for him to be angry with you?

07:20.100 --> 07:23.000
Kevin had the makings of a great photographer.

07:23.100 --> 07:25.300
He had everything that it took...

07:25.800 --> 07:27.900
except for patience.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.300
There was a gallery showing
that he was just desperate to get into.

07:32.800 --> 07:36.200
And he wanted me to make a call on his behalf,
but I told him that he wasn't ready.

07:36.300 --> 07:37.300
Was he upset?

07:37.400 --> 07:40.500
He took it really hard,
like I was telling him he didn't have a future.

07:40.600 --> 07:45.500
But in this business,
you only get one introduction, one shot,

07:45.600 --> 07:47.800
and I didn't want to blow it for him.

07:47.900 --> 07:51.500
I mean, I thought of 100 different ways
that I could have told him, but--

07:51.600 --> 07:55.000
but you thought no matter what the outcome,
it would have always been the same?

07:55.500 --> 07:56.800
I don't know.

07:58.100 --> 08:01.300
I mean, would he have been driving down
a dangerous road at 90 miles an hour

08:01.400 --> 08:03.400
if he thought he had more to live for?

08:03.500 --> 08:04.800
That's every teacher's worst nightmare, you know.

08:04.900 --> 08:07.600
You toss a kid a low grade or a criticism.

08:07.700 --> 08:11.300
Next thing you know, he snaps his cap,
and he wants to off himself or you.

08:11.400 --> 08:12.500
Is that what you're thinking?

08:12.600 --> 08:14.600
Maybe he found a way to do both?

08:14.700 --> 08:16.100
I don't know.

08:16.200 --> 08:18.200
Was this always here?

08:18.300 --> 08:20.700
This translucent shape, do you see it?

08:21.500 --> 08:24.100
- Have you seen it anywhere else?
- Yeah.

08:24.900 --> 08:28.700
Last week, in one of my students' work.
His name's joseph.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.200
Did he know kevin?

08:30.500 --> 08:31.700
Yeah.

08:32.500 --> 08:34.700
Professor pollili knows
everybody in the photo world.

08:34.799 --> 08:36.900
She picks up the phone, and your slides get seen.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.500
So it's that easy?

08:38.700 --> 08:41.400
Well, she has to like your work.

08:41.700 --> 08:44.100
What about kevin?
Did she like his work?

08:44.900 --> 08:46.600
She's tough but fair.

08:46.700 --> 08:51.200
And no disrespect to the dead, because
kevin seemed like a nice guy,a good artist,

08:51.300 --> 08:54.300
but those 2 things, even in combination...

08:54.800 --> 08:56.300
they're not enough. You know what I mean?

08:56.400 --> 08:57.600
I'm not sure I do.

08:58.500 --> 08:59.900
It's so competitive.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.900
It's, like,this tiny market
with too many people to begin with.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.500
And if you don't have what it takes,
what people want...

09:06.400 --> 09:08.200
then you get squeezed out.

09:08.400 --> 09:10.100
And kevin was feeling that squeeze.

09:10.300 --> 09:14.200
Because she made phone calls
on your behalf and not on his?

09:15.200 --> 09:17.200
Yeah. Basically.

09:17.300 --> 09:21.800
She said that you had some photos
with this strange shape in them.

09:21.900 --> 09:23.600
Yeah. Yeah, right. Uh...

09:23.900 --> 09:25.200
that was weird.

09:25.400 --> 09:29.000
I did this ocean series last week-- 
just sand, water...

09:29.100 --> 09:32.300
and this kind of cool translucent thing.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.800
I don't-- I don't know how it happened,
but it looks great.

09:34.900 --> 09:36.400
Can I see them?

09:36.500 --> 09:40.500
- Yeah. Yeah. Um...I could email them to you.
- Thanks.

09:40.600 --> 09:44.100
I promised delia
that I'd check out her inventory spreadsheet.

09:44.200 --> 09:46.800
I also want to download those photos
from that guy joseph.

09:46.900 --> 09:49.300
That's claudia's star pupil, right?
The one your ghost had it out for?

09:49.400 --> 09:51.000
If that's what it's about.

09:51.100 --> 09:53.100
Kevin said his teacher--

09:53.200 --> 09:57.300
I don't know-- helped another grad student
get into more galleries than him.

09:57.500 --> 09:59.600
I don't want to sound harsh,but boo-hoo.

09:59.700 --> 10:00.700
Or boo.

10:00.900 --> 10:02.700
But since when have ghosts become reasonable?

10:02.800 --> 10:04.200
- It just makes me mad.
- What?

10:04.300 --> 10:07.400
That this file's taking so long,
or that he's tormenting his professor?

10:07.500 --> 10:10.900
Oh, because claudia tried to hold him back
until he was ready for the big, bad art world.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.600
I mean, honestly,

10:12.700 --> 10:14.800
that's the worst thing
that's happened to that guy? Seriously?

10:14.900 --> 10:16.900
That's the story he wants told?

10:19.200 --> 10:21.100
Are you seeing this?

10:21.600 --> 10:24.100
I just assumed 
the translucent shape was kevin, but...

10:25.100 --> 10:27.800
well, that doesn't look like any kevin I've met.

10:27.900 --> 10:31.200
Either I have the wrong ghost,
or he's telling a different story.

10:35.700 --> 10:36.700
- Jim saw this?
- Yeah,

10:36.800 --> 10:40.600
and so we clicked back on the same file again,
and then it was just a still photo of the beach.

10:40.700 --> 10:42.400
That's a haunting.
She's made her presence known.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.300
Yeah, but I don't get it.
What does she want us to know?

10:44.400 --> 10:47.700
For starters, she probably wants you to know
you checked the wrong box under "sex of ghost."

10:47.800 --> 10:49.900
Ok, fine, so she's a girl, not a guy.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.900
But this all began with kevin's death,
and I think he's the key.

10:53.200 --> 10:57.100
Maybe claudia knows more than she's saying.

10:57.500 --> 10:59.200
Or even realizes.

11:03.100 --> 11:05.000
Claudia, what happened in here?

11:05.100 --> 11:06.400
She's everywhere.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.500
Here, all my pictures at home.

11:09.100 --> 11:11.700
Joseph came by, and she's in all his pictures, too.

11:11.800 --> 11:14.000
- Who is she?
- I don't know.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.300
Joseph swears he doesn't know, either.

11:17.200 --> 11:19.900
- Why's this happening?
- I don't know.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
It's unusual for a ghost to
want to haunt a complete stranger.

11:23.100 --> 11:25.400
Maybe it has something to do with this place.

11:25.500 --> 11:28.000
Well, maybe it's not something you did.

11:28.300 --> 11:29.700
- How well do you know this joseph?
- He's a student.

11:29.800 --> 11:31.300
I'm not involved in his personal life.

11:31.400 --> 11:35.700
Well, did kevin ever talk to you about a girl?
I mean, maybe this joseph's lying.

11:35.800 --> 11:37.600
Maybe it was some kind of romantic triangle--

11:37.700 --> 11:39.700
I told you. I don't know her, ok?

11:39.800 --> 11:42.700
How am I supposed to help you?
I've never seen this girl before in my life.

11:44.500 --> 11:48.300
So this ghost is now showing up
in claudia's pictures and joseph'S.

11:48.400 --> 11:50.500
Claudia seems to be falling apart because of it,

11:50.600 --> 11:53.900
and joseph, as far as I can tell, 
is shrugging it off as weird.

11:54.800 --> 11:56.900
There's still days I wish I was 23

11:57.400 --> 11:59.200
anceconvind d nothing bad
would ever happen to me again.

11:59.300 --> 12:00.600
- You want mustard with this?
- No, thanks.

12:00.700 --> 12:01.700
What's that?

12:01.800 --> 12:04.100
Oh, this, it's just a study guide.

12:04.600 --> 12:08.000
- Isn't it for medical school?
- Well, yeah, technically. Sure.

12:08.500 --> 12:11.000
Ok, so you're gonna go to medical school?
That's great!

12:11.100 --> 12:14.100
Mel, there's a big difference
between going and applying.

12:15.700 --> 12:18.100
The southern michigan catalog,
is that why we got that?

12:18.200 --> 12:19.600
I thought it was just junk mail.

12:19.700 --> 12:21.700
Look, I'm just checking out the possibilities, ok?

12:21.800 --> 12:24.200
Or, in my case, the impossibilities.

12:24.800 --> 12:26.900
Look, the chances of getting in
anywhere are so slim, I thought,

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
since my dad went there,
 I had an edge being a legacy.

12:30.100 --> 12:33.700
So you're not just gonna change careers,
we might be moving to michigan.

12:33.800 --> 12:35.100
No. I haven't even applied.

12:35.200 --> 12:36.900
What about our life here? And my store.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.900
I mean, were you even going
to talk to me about this?

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Of course. I'm just trying to figure it out
by myself at first.

12:41.100 --> 12:45.300
I'm your wife, 
so why aren't you figuring it out with me?

12:46.500 --> 12:48.700
This is a huge conversation, all right?

12:49.100 --> 12:51.800
And it isn't just about your store,
you know that.It's about what you do.

12:51.900 --> 12:54.000
I mean, that's the real discussion, isn't it?

12:54.100 --> 12:56.100
I mean, whether we could ever leave grandview

12:56.200 --> 12:58.900
knowing what we know about this place
and what's underneath it.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.100
That's why I wanted to wait.
Look, I don't even know what I want here.

13:02.200 --> 13:03.800
Or what I even have the right to ask you about.

13:03.900 --> 13:05.300
- Jim...
- let's just talk about it later, all right?

13:05.400 --> 13:08.200
I gotta go to work, 
you gotta cross over a nasty ghost.

13:08.300 --> 13:10.600
Another one, that's what you mean.

13:10.800 --> 13:12.900
No, I didn't mean that. I didn't say that.

13:15.100 --> 13:17.600
Look, I love you, ok? We'll figure this out.

13:22.400 --> 13:24.900
- Is this kevin?
- Yeah.You never met him?

13:25.100 --> 13:28.400
- He was a friend of a friend.
- Well, it's nice of you to help out.

13:29.200 --> 13:31.500
I can't imagine packing up someone's life.

13:31.600 --> 13:34.000
Uh, this girl. Do you know her?

13:34.100 --> 13:35.600
'Cause I'm trying to get in touch with her.

13:35.700 --> 13:38.900
I gave him a lease to sign,
and ran into him getting mail once.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.200
He was always alone.

13:40.300 --> 13:42.500
I'm gonna be here for a little bit. Is that ok?

13:42.600 --> 13:45.500
- Just drop the keys downstairs.
- Thank you.

13:47.000 --> 13:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:13.000 --> 14:16.200
Hi, this is kevin. You know what to do, so do it.

14:21.900 --> 14:24.000
Saved messages.

14:24.500 --> 14:28.000
Hey, it's sophie. Um, obviously.

14:28.100 --> 14:32.800
Look, I know you're pissed,
but we need to talk, and not on the phone.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.300
I love you.

14:34.400 --> 14:36.400
And you can't get rid of me that easy.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.200
Sophie.

15:23.500 --> 15:24.900
And here you go.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.600
I am so sorry! Do you need some help?

15:26.700 --> 15:27.700
No, no, we're ok. It's fine.

15:27.800 --> 15:28.800
- All right, you good?
- Yeah.

15:28.900 --> 15:30.400
Ok, great.

15:30.500 --> 15:33.700
I'm so sorry. I didn't even know
we had a customer until 5 seconds ago.

15:33.800 --> 15:37.700
Well, I might be a little distracted, too,
if I thought I just saw somebody drown.

15:37.800 --> 15:41.300
Well, it was a vision,
so it's just something the ghost experienced,

15:41.400 --> 15:43.400
but if I don't know who she is,
I can't even help her.

15:43.500 --> 15:44.500
I've checked obits for her.

15:44.600 --> 15:48.700
And I've checked sophies, sophias,
the local area in iowa where kevin's from.

15:48.800 --> 15:50.900
You know what, 
maybe I should check accidental drownings.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.400
Yeah, but why?

15:52.500 --> 15:56.200
Didn't her message say
"you can't get rid of me that easily?"

15:56.600 --> 15:57.700
Well, maybe he did.

15:57.800 --> 16:00.900
And maybe the guilt over
what he had done got to him.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.400
Or her ghost did. I mean,
it would explain how their deaths are tied.

16:04.600 --> 16:08.100
But it doesn't explain the connection
with kevin's professor or the other student.

16:08.200 --> 16:09.800
Well, what about kevin's phone?

16:09.900 --> 16:12.300
Maybe her last name would
show up on the caller I.D.

16:12.400 --> 16:13.400
He didn't have it.

16:13.500 --> 16:15.600
- Did he have a cell phone?
- I didn't see one.

16:16.300 --> 16:18.100
You said he died in a car accident, right?

16:18.200 --> 16:22.100
When was the last time you got in a car
and you didn't have your cell phone?

16:23.200 --> 16:25.100
You're right. You're right.

16:25.200 --> 16:27.800
Maybe the police have it, or the morgue.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.200
Now would be a great time to ask jim for a favor.

16:30.300 --> 16:32.400
I've got the store covered. Go, go.

16:32.500 --> 16:34.200
It's not that, but thanks.

16:34.400 --> 16:36.300
We kind of had an argument.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.800
Looks like jim might be going to medical school.

16:38.900 --> 16:42.000
Which is amazing, 
and see how your face just lit up?

16:42.100 --> 16:44.200
That was-- that was my face.

16:44.500 --> 16:48.400
Then I realized he's looking out of state,
and he hid it from me.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.700
You know, melinda, that is a huge decision.

16:53.800 --> 16:56.500
And I'm sure he had 
a lot of reservations about it.

16:56.600 --> 16:59.700
No, his reservation is about living here.

17:00.200 --> 17:02.900
Especially after what happened in the tunnels.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.400
They're just holding kevin's stuff
till the highway patrol report comes in.

17:09.099 --> 17:12.000
- Thanks for calling in a favor.
- Sure.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.099
It's funny what survives.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.300
There's a few recent calls...one from sophie.

17:18.500 --> 17:20.000
Check the timestamp.

17:20.099 --> 17:22.400
Day that kevin died.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.700
It's a video.

17:25.900 --> 17:27.200
She's at the beach.

17:27.300 --> 17:28.700
I trusted you.

17:29.200 --> 17:31.300
I gave up my life for you.

17:31.700 --> 17:35.500
That's what you want, isn't it?****

17:38.900 --> 17:41.600
- She sent that to kevin?
- Oh, my god.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
She's gonna drown.

17:50.500 --> 17:51.500
What is it?

17:51.600 --> 17:55.500
I think we just saw a 21st century suicide note.

18:00.500 --> 18:03.600
Patient was complaining of chest pains.
We administered an E.K.G.

18:04.200 --> 18:07.800
I'm looking at the irregularities.
He's got S.T. Elevations.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.400
Looks like he's having a heart attack.

18:09.500 --> 18:11.900
- Did you administer thrombolytics?
- Uh, no.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.900
I mean, he doesn't have the classic complaints.

18:15.200 --> 18:16.500
He's got no arm discomfort.

18:16.600 --> 18:18.600
He's got no diaphoresis, as you can see.

18:18.800 --> 18:21.700
Look, he has sharp pains.
He leans forward, he feels relief.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.100
I mean, could it be pericarditis?

18:23.200 --> 18:26.400
He's having chest pains with S.T. Elevations.
We have to treat this as a heart attack.

18:26.500 --> 18:28.400
Let's get going on the thrombolytics.

18:29.400 --> 18:30.800
Don't you think there's a chance there might be--

18:30.900 --> 18:33.000
we'll take it from here.
Thanks for bringing it in.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.400
Hello?

18:46.600 --> 18:47.900
Claudia?

19:00.500 --> 19:03.600
Ok...sophie, I'm here.

19:04.900 --> 19:07.600
And I want to understand what happened to you.

19:08.800 --> 19:11.200
Why did you hurt yourself?

20:01.500 --> 20:02.800
Melinda?

20:03.600 --> 20:05.100
What are you doing?

20:14.100 --> 20:15.600
Where did you get these?

20:15.700 --> 20:17.900
Um, it's complicated,

20:18.200 --> 20:23.400
but I think the girl who's been showing up
in your photos wanted me to see this.

20:23.500 --> 20:25.200
Oh, my god.

20:26.200 --> 20:27.500
Claudia, I'm not here to judge you,

20:27.600 --> 20:30.500
but I think that someone got hurt
by aat youwhnd kevin did.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.500
You don't know anything. You can'T.

20:32.600 --> 20:35.600
I know a girl name sophie
who is in love with kevin,

20:36.200 --> 20:40.400
and she said that she would give up
her life for him, and I watched her do it.

20:41.500 --> 20:44.400
And I think it's
because kevin was sleeping with you.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.700
What did you say her name was?

20:46.800 --> 20:48.400
Sophie.

20:48.500 --> 20:50.500
She killed herself, and now she's haunting you.

20:50.600 --> 20:52.200
And I don't think she's going to stop.

20:52.300 --> 20:55.000
I can't take this another second.
Do you understand?

20:55.800 --> 20:57.300
Please.

20:58.100 --> 21:00.600
Please just leave me alone.

21:00.700 --> 21:02.900
You're making a big mistake.

21:04.100 --> 21:06.100
It wouldn't be the first.

22:21.800 --> 22:25.500
You have to know, 
I have never been involved with a student before.

22:25.900 --> 22:27.900
Never even thought about it.

22:28.100 --> 22:30.700
With kevin, there's just this connection.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.400
Of course there was.
He looked up to you. You were his teacher.

22:33.500 --> 22:35.800
It wasn't just that he looked up to me.

22:35.900 --> 22:37.500
I know it was wrong.

22:37.800 --> 22:39.400
I knew it was wrong then.

22:39.900 --> 22:43.100
But he was just so passionate, so talented.

22:43.200 --> 22:45.700
Look, I'm in no position to judge here, ok,

22:45.800 --> 22:48.900
but you were his teacher.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
That's not a relationship between equals.
That's why this is a problem.

22:52.100 --> 22:53.700
I'm sorry I wasn't honest with you.

22:53.800 --> 22:57.000
You know what, it's ok. You gave me a
hundred reasons why not to go out with me.

22:57.100 --> 22:59.800
It turns out it was just one. I got it.

22:59.800 --> 23:03.200
Ok, why don't you tell me more about sophie?

23:05.800 --> 23:07.700
I, um...

23:08.600 --> 23:11.800
knew that he had a girlfriend back home.

23:12.300 --> 23:14.400
They were having problems.

23:16.000 --> 23:20.600
But I didn't think that she knew about me.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.400
And we were over.

23:22.800 --> 23:24.800
Kevin had already ended it,

23:25.800 --> 23:28.500
and, to be honest,
I think I was a little relieved,

23:28.600 --> 23:31.300
thinking, stupidly,

23:31.400 --> 23:34.100
that we'd gotten out without anyone being hurt.

23:34.700 --> 23:39.400
But then, when you said her name, sophie,

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
I just felt sick.

23:42.100 --> 23:44.200
How can both of these people be dead?

23:44.300 --> 23:46.900
I'm trying to figure out the same thing.

23:48.800 --> 23:50.700
Claudia, there was A...

23:50.900 --> 23:55.400
a timestamp on the suicide video
that she sent to kevin.

23:56.500 --> 23:59.500
They died within an hour of each other.

24:00.200 --> 24:01.900
Oh, my god.

24:04.700 --> 24:06.300
That's why he ran out.

24:06.400 --> 24:08.400
Then do it. One phone call to one gallery.

24:08.600 --> 24:12.800
Kevin, belive me, these people are such snobs,
and you are not ready.

24:13.200 --> 24:14.500
If they pass on you once, that's it.

24:14.600 --> 24:17.800
A second phone call from me
 isn't going to get you a second chance.

24:17.900 --> 24:20.500
- You need time to--
- I don't have time.

24:23.400 --> 24:25.800
- It's sophie.
- Take it.

24:27.300 --> 24:29.600
I know how much she means to you.

24:31.600 --> 24:33.800
We're done, I know that.

24:36.900 --> 24:38.800
I gave up my life for you.

24:38.900 --> 24:41.100
That's what you want, isn't it?

24:45.800 --> 24:48.400
No wonder he was driving
90 miles an hour down that terrible road.

24:48.500 --> 24:51.100
- He was trying to get to her.
- Or he realized he was too late,

24:51.200 --> 24:52.500
and he didn't care if he ever made it.

24:52.600 --> 24:54.900
You said that he spoke about her once before.

24:55.200 --> 24:58.800
Her, um, her last name was owens.

25:00.100 --> 25:03.100
Kevin said that she had a sister in bridgeport.

25:03.200 --> 25:06.900
Maybe the sister can tell you 
what you need to help sophie move on.

25:15.300 --> 25:16.400
Hi.

25:17.200 --> 25:18.800
Can I help you?

25:19.300 --> 25:20.900
- Sophie?
- Yeah.

25:22.200 --> 25:23.600
Do I know you?

25:24.000 --> 25:26.200
I saw you die.

25:28.200 --> 25:30.700
I told myself****

25:32.200 --> 25:35.200
I told myself his death
was just a stupid accident.

25:35.300 --> 25:37.900
But what happened to you, that was no accident.

25:39.100 --> 25:40.300
No.

25:40.900 --> 25:45.600
No, I tried to hurt myself,
but I couldn't go through with it.

25:46.200 --> 25:48.800
It's horrible to even think about.

25:49.300 --> 25:54.700
But...
but what I don't understand is how...you saw it.

25:55.200 --> 25:57.800
Kevin's cell phone was with his effects.

25:57.900 --> 26:02.600
Um, those photos,
has anything changed in them since kevin's death?

26:02.800 --> 26:04.200
No.

26:04.500 --> 26:06.200
What are you talking about?

26:06.300 --> 26:09.400
And how did you know kevin exactly?

26:09.500 --> 26:12.000
- I know how he hurt you.
-  How could you?

26:12.100 --> 26:16.300
After kevin's death, some strange images
started showing up in photographs.

26:16.400 --> 26:19.000
- Oh, what kind of images?
- Ghostly images.

26:19.100 --> 26:24.700
It was sort of a white, wispy image at first,
and then there were images of you,

26:24.900 --> 26:26.800
drowning from the video that you sent kevin.

26:26.900 --> 26:28.800
This doesn't make any sense.

26:28.900 --> 26:33.100
See, he was actually able to
take the skills he had in life to...

26:33.500 --> 26:35.800
torment people in death.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.500
Your images were used for
 a professor at rockland university.

26:41.400 --> 26:44.100
Claudia polilli.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.800
Claudia.

26:47.900 --> 26:51.500
Oh. Of course that was her.

26:51.700 --> 26:53.100
I'm so stupid.

26:53.200 --> 26:55.200
He used to talk about her all the time.

26:55.300 --> 26:58.800
For everyone's sake,
can you please just tell me what happened?

26:59.000 --> 27:03.700
You said something in your message
that he couldn't get rid of you so easily.

27:04.200 --> 27:06.800
Because we've been fighting so much.

27:07.400 --> 27:11.600
Every time I hung up, 
I wondered if we had broken up.

27:13.100 --> 27:16.500
He wanted me to give up my job
in iowa and move here,

27:16.800 --> 27:20.400
If we kept it long distance,
our relationship just wasn't gonna make it.

27:20.500 --> 27:21.400
Kevin?

27:21.500 --> 27:26.100
We fought and fought until I decided
I was going to make the committment.

27:26.500 --> 27:31.100
He always got mad
'cause he said I wasn't interested in his work.

27:33.700 --> 27:35.700
But I didn't understand it.

27:35.800 --> 27:41.500
I mean, what could he see through
the lens of his camera that made him so happy?

27:44.300 --> 27:46.200
I got my answer.

27:49.900 --> 27:51.600
All of a sudden, my...

27:52.500 --> 27:56.900
my body went cold. I couldn't--I couldn't breathe.

27:57.500 --> 28:00.100
I had to get out of there,
but I didn't know where to go.

28:00.700 --> 28:03.400
Next thing I knew, I was at the beach.

28:03.900 --> 28:09.000
I used to go there when I'd come visit,
and kevin would ask me to stay.

28:10.800 --> 28:13.400
And here I was, and for good.

28:14.600 --> 28:16.100
And for what?

28:17.600 --> 28:19.600
I felt so...

28:19.800 --> 28:23.900
empty and stupid and...disposable.

28:24.000 --> 28:27.200
My heart hurt so much I wanted to die.

28:27.600 --> 28:30.000
It--it wasn't something that I planned.

28:30.100 --> 28:33.500
It was just something I did without thinking.

28:35.500 --> 28:39.300
I--I think a part of me believed
that was what he deserved--

28:39.800 --> 28:42.400
to be hurt with pictures the way he hurt me.

28:42.500 --> 28:44.200
***

28:44.300 --> 28:46.700
I gave up my life my for you.

28:47.100 --> 28:49.200
That's what you want, isn't it?

28:50.600 --> 28:54.000
The waves just kept knocking me back.

28:57.000 --> 29:01.200
My lungs filled with water, my body just took over.

29:14.400 --> 29:17.900
It made me realize how crazy I was being.

29:18.400 --> 29:22.200
I mean, to let anyone have that much power over me.

29:22.400 --> 29:24.100
I raced back to the apartment.

29:24.200 --> 29:28.500
By the time I got there, the police were calling,
saying there'd been an accident.

29:29.200 --> 29:31.000
I wanted to hurt him, but not like that.

29:31.100 --> 29:33.700
I didn't want him to get hurt like that.

29:34.400 --> 29:36.900
I need you to help me reach him.

29:37.200 --> 29:38.300
Why?

29:40.400 --> 29:46.200
Because kevin's spirit or whatever
is trying to torture this claudia person?

29:46.600 --> 29:47.800
Yes.

29:48.100 --> 29:51.200
Sophie, I know how hard this is, I really do,

29:52.000 --> 29:54.500
but haven't enough people been hurt?

29:54.900 --> 29:57.600
Maybe it's just her guilt that's haunting her.

29:59.500 --> 30:03.700
I don't know who you are
or how you know all these things, but...

30:04.400 --> 30:07.600
if she's suffering,
then it's because of what they did, not me.

30:08.900 --> 30:10.700
And that's all I have to say.

30:13.900 --> 30:15.800
You have my number.

30:45.900 --> 30:47.300
What?

30:54.200 --> 30:57.000
No! No, kevin!

31:03.900 --> 31:05.500
No, kevin!

31:05.600 --> 31:08.100
Please, please...

31:26.700 --> 31:28.100
Hello?

31:49.500 --> 31:51.400
Sophie, it's me, melinda.

32:08.600 --> 32:11.500
Sophie, breathe. Please breathe.

32:12.200 --> 32:13.300
What?

32:19.100 --> 32:20.400
Ok.

32:24.600 --> 32:26.300
Ok.

32:27.700 --> 32:30.600
Yes, I need an ambulance at 215 havenwood lane.

32:30.700 --> 32:32.100
Yes, I'm in the residence.

32:32.200 --> 32:33.800
- I thought she was dead.
- You're scaring her.

32:33.900 --> 32:35.900
You have to cross over. Yes, I'm here.

32:36.500 --> 32:40.000
Um, yes, she is breathing now, but she has asthma.

32:40.200 --> 32:42.100
No, I gave her the inhaler.

32:43.200 --> 32:45.300
Ok, deep breaths.

32:45.400 --> 32:47.100
Ok? Deep breaths.

32:47.200 --> 32:49.400
- Will you tell her I'm here?
- You're hurting her.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.900
I've seen more than you know.

32:52.100 --> 32:54.900
Ok? And I know
what happens to people when they don't--

32:57.600 --> 32:59.800
ok, sophie, it's going to be all right. Hello?

32:59.900 --> 33:03.000
Yes, I'm still here. Please hurry.

33:05.300 --> 33:07.800
Wow, I feel bad for the guy, 
that's a brutal procedure.

33:07.900 --> 33:11.400
But you said he's stable? And it was pericarditis?

33:12.400 --> 33:14.600
Oh, good. All right. Well, if he's ok.

33:15.200 --> 33:16.400
Thanks, man. Bye.

33:16.600 --> 33:20.400
So you were right about the guy
not having a heart attack.

33:20.500 --> 33:24.100
Yeah, but then the medication they gave him,
you see, it unclogs everything,

33:24.200 --> 33:25.400
and his heart chamber filled with blood,

33:25.500 --> 33:28.000
and they had to do this really
invasive procedure to drain it.

33:28.100 --> 33:29.800
Oh, that's awful.

33:30.300 --> 33:33.100
- The E.R. Doctor should have listened to you.
- No, not really.

33:33.200 --> 33:37.500
I mean, she read the E.K.G.,
She made a quick diagnosis. That's her job.

33:37.800 --> 33:39.800
That's what sucks about being a doctor, I guess.

33:40.200 --> 33:41.600
It's a lot of guess work on the fly.

33:41.700 --> 33:45.000
You'd be a great doctor... if you wanted to be.

33:45.800 --> 33:46.800
Yeah.

33:48.700 --> 33:51.300
It's just, you're always so supportive of me, and...

33:52.100 --> 33:54.400
I want to do the same for you.

33:56.700 --> 34:00.000
Ok, let'S... let's just do first things first, ok?

34:00.100 --> 34:02.600
I see what you go through, you know?
I know the stakes.

34:02.900 --> 34:06.300
And you were late tonight because basically,
you were saving somebody's life.

34:06.500 --> 34:08.500
- That's not the point.
- No, it is the point.

34:08.900 --> 34:11.300
What you do for people, 
come on, it's not like a job.

34:11.400 --> 34:13.100
I can't ask you to give that up.

34:13.900 --> 34:15.400
You know, to take care of me.

34:15.500 --> 34:20.699
But, honey, you can't ask me
to stop wanting to take care of you.

34:20.800 --> 34:22.100
- Jim--
- no, and you're right.

34:22.199 --> 34:24.500
Because what that makes me do

34:24.699 --> 34:26.500
is sometimes want to get you the hell out of here.

34:26.600 --> 34:28.500
People die everywhere.

34:28.800 --> 34:30.600
- Their ghosts can find me.
- No.

34:30.699 --> 34:33.300
You and I both know
there's something about this place.

34:33.400 --> 34:37.800
Lately, I haven't been able to shake the feeling
that maybe we didn't choose grandview.

34:38.100 --> 34:39.900
Maybe it chose us.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.800
I think the same thing.

34:42.000 --> 34:46.000
But if that's true, it had to be for a reason.

34:46.100 --> 34:49.300
And a good one, 
and I'm not going to run away from that.

34:51.300 --> 34:55.100
So if that's your only reason
for wanting to leave grandview, then...

34:57.400 --> 35:00.100
I'm sorry, I can't support that.

35:08.800 --> 35:13.500
So what are we supposed to do,
just wait for some sign from kevin?

35:15.700 --> 35:17.600
Sophie, this is claudia.

35:17.900 --> 35:19.700
Claudia, this is sophie.

35:21.100 --> 35:23.300
I know exactly who you are.

35:24.400 --> 35:25.500
What is she doing here?

35:25.600 --> 35:27.300
I know how hard this is for you.

35:28.200 --> 35:32.800
But I think you both need to forgive each other
and move on with the rest of your lives.

35:34.800 --> 35:37.000
I never meant for anyone to get hurt.

35:37.100 --> 35:41.300
Then why'd you do it?
Why'd you take something that wasn't yours?

35:41.600 --> 35:43.800
She didn'T. I did.

35:44.300 --> 35:45.600
He's here.

35:47.600 --> 35:50.700
You tell sophie that I--
I just lost my way without her.

35:50.800 --> 35:52.800
He said he was lost without you.

35:53.800 --> 35:56.800
There were so many times
I asked her to move to the east coast with me,

35:57.000 --> 36:00.200
and all she ever thought about was
how would we make it without her job,

36:00.800 --> 36:03.600
and all I heard was she
thought I wasn't gonna make it.

36:03.700 --> 36:05.500
He thought you didn't believe in him.

36:05.700 --> 36:09.100
I did. I dropped everything to come here.

36:09.500 --> 36:12.200
I didn't know that.
I was so focused on trying to make a sale,

36:12.300 --> 36:14.300
or even having an actual show

36:14.400 --> 36:16.800
so she'd see that I wasn't going to fail.

36:16.900 --> 36:19.400
He wanted to prove himself to you.

36:19.700 --> 36:20.900
He wanted to make a sale, and--

36:21.000 --> 36:23.800
that's why he got so angry
when I wouldn't help him.

36:24.500 --> 36:26.300
Yeah, I wasn't fair.

36:26.900 --> 36:28.100
To either of them.

36:28.200 --> 36:30.800
He knows that you were just trying to protect him.

36:31.200 --> 36:33.100
Tell her that I'm so sorry.

36:33.700 --> 36:35.200
I will.

36:35.800 --> 36:38.700
But I ended up hurting the one I loved the most.

36:38.800 --> 36:41.300
He feels terrible about what happened.

36:41.700 --> 36:45.500
He wanted the truth to come about
what he had done and how he had hurt you.

36:46.400 --> 36:49.100
And he knew you'd be the only that could tell it.

36:53.400 --> 36:57.000
I just wanted to mean
as much to you as your work did.

36:57.200 --> 37:00.100
And I loved the way you looked at the world.
I just...

37:01.000 --> 37:03.500
wondered, did you see me?

37:05.300 --> 37:08.000
Sophie, you were in everything that I did.

37:08.100 --> 37:10.900
And everything that I made,
you were a part of it all.

37:12.400 --> 37:14.300
Can you make her understand?

37:19.700 --> 37:21.600
Is that the light?

37:22.800 --> 37:25.200
It's so incredible.

37:27.200 --> 37:30.900
Look... you tell her that
I can't go unless I know she's forgiven me.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.300
He needs to know that you forgive him.

37:40.300 --> 37:42.400
I forgive you, kevin.

37:43.500 --> 37:47.200
And I'm not sorry that I loved you.
At least I know I can.

37:54.500 --> 37:56.300
He's gone.

38:21.900 --> 38:23.900
a picture = 1000 words
here's one - thanks

38:53.200 --> 38:54.900
I hate fighting.

38:55.800 --> 38:58.000
Neither of us ever wins.

38:59.100 --> 39:01.700
I know you're just trying to protect me.

39:02.000 --> 39:07.000
I've been thinking a lot about the
dark spirits don't just lurk underground.

39:07.500 --> 39:10.000
That they're around me all the time.

39:10.600 --> 39:13.500
I just want you to know
that that doesn't scare me.

39:13.700 --> 39:15.300
How is that reassuring?

39:15.400 --> 39:20.700
Because...anger and darkness, that's just

39:21.000 --> 39:24.400
the stuff we're supposed to
unravel and learn from.

39:25.500 --> 39:29.100
And I do that all the time, with the spirits.

39:32.400 --> 39:35.100
And I'm not afraid because...

39:37.400 --> 39:40.300
I know that love is stronger.

39:41.200 --> 39:43.200
I've seen it.

39:48.400 --> 39:51.400
Ok. No decisions based on fear.

39:51.500 --> 39:54.100
No decisions based on fear.

39:55.800 --> 39:57.900
Does that include trigonometry
and organic chemistry,

39:58.000 --> 39:59.400
because these are terrifying.

39:59.500 --> 40:02.200
It means a whole year of undergrad courses
before I can even apply.

40:02.300 --> 40:03.900
Oh, my god.

40:05.300 --> 40:06.900
You're gonna do it, aren't you?

40:07.000 --> 40:09.400
Well, if you can fight the forces of evil,
I think I can do pre-med.

40:09.500 --> 40:10.800
Say it.

40:11.200 --> 40:13.100
I really need to hear you say it.

40:13.200 --> 40:15.300
I want to be a doctor.

40:18.100 --> 40:19.000
What are you getting?

40:19.100 --> 40:23.200
Just...close your eyes.
I got you something.

40:28.400 --> 40:29.500
