WEBVTT

00:02.737 --> 00:05.604
<i>Previously on Battlestar Galactica.</i>

00:38.139 --> 00:39.436
Radiological alarm.

00:39.507 --> 00:40.439
From where?

00:40.508 --> 00:42.976
<i>The Olympic Carrier, sir.
They've got nukes on board.</i>

00:43.044 --> 00:45.979
If the ship poses a threat to us,
we have to eliminate that threat.

00:46.047 --> 00:49.414
The Cylons will be here any second. If
we're gonna do this, then just do it.

00:49.484 --> 00:51.008
It's a civilian ship.

00:51.085 --> 00:52.052
Do it.

00:54.956 --> 00:55.945
Giving up my seat.

00:56.023 --> 00:56.955
Like hell.

01:01.863 --> 01:03.854
Sharon?
What are you doing here?

01:04.699 --> 01:06.724
Let's move, mister.

03:17.965 --> 03:19.091
Excuse me, Lieutenant.

03:19.166 --> 03:20.929
Specialist. Good evening.

03:21.002 --> 03:22.026
Sir?

03:22.370 --> 03:23.667
Is something wrong?

03:23.738 --> 03:25.899
No, sir.
It's just morning, sir.

03:26.941 --> 03:28.033
What time is it?

03:28.109 --> 03:29.303
05:45.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.018
Oh, my God.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.484
Oh, my God.

04:24.131 --> 04:26.258
Where are the rest of them?

05:45.779 --> 05:48.043
<i>Attention. Colonial
One will arrive in 30 minutes.</i>

05:48.115 --> 05:49.446
<i>Honor detail report
in quarters.</i>

05:49.516 --> 05:50.881
Where the hell is it?

05:51.618 --> 05:53.745
Damned son of a sash.

05:55.288 --> 05:57.085
I heard you the first time.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.006
One.

06:23.116 --> 06:24.208
Two.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.212
Three.

06:29.823 --> 06:30.983
Four.

06:35.028 --> 06:36.086
Five.

06:43.904 --> 06:44.836
<i>Do it.</i>

07:05.292 --> 07:08.887
<i>I can't stop thinking
about the Olympic Carrier.</i>

07:09.296 --> 07:11.127
That was three days ago.

07:11.865 --> 07:14.459
It's ancient history
under these circumstances.

07:14.534 --> 07:17.332
Leave the second-guessing
to the historians.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.333
But don't we have
a responsibility?

07:22.409 --> 07:23.398
I mean...

07:24.644 --> 07:28.671
as leaders, don't we have an
obligation to question our actions to...

07:30.083 --> 07:34.110
I don't know. To make sure the decisions
that we make are the right decisions.

07:34.187 --> 07:36.747
We did what we had to do, Son.

07:36.923 --> 07:40.620
A man takes responsibility for
his actions, right or wrong.

07:42.028 --> 07:44.895
He accepts the consequences
and lives with them...

07:45.932 --> 07:47.229
every day.

07:51.471 --> 07:54.372
<i>Colonial One, Galactica.
Proceed to Omega Docking.</i>

07:54.441 --> 07:57.103
<i>Contact CIC
when you have hard seal.</i>

07:57.777 --> 07:59.438
<i>Roger that, Galactica.</i>

08:04.751 --> 08:06.946
Excuse me, Madam
President. We've arrived-

08:07.020 --> 08:09.921
Please don't tell me that
we have to go through this...

08:09.990 --> 08:12.049
every time I step
on that ship.

08:12.125 --> 08:16.027
No, ma'am. But they will always render
honors for your arrival. It's protocol.

08:16.096 --> 08:18.121
The military,
they do love their protocol.

08:18.198 --> 08:20.792
I'm sure if they knew you didn't
like it, they'd be willing to-

08:20.867 --> 08:23.301
No. Let Adama
sound the trumpets.

08:23.770 --> 08:27.297
I think it makes him feel more comfortable.
Maybe if he feels more comfortable...

08:27.374 --> 08:29.399
he'll be a little easier
to deal with.

08:29.476 --> 08:30.909
That's smart.

08:30.977 --> 08:33.810
No, it's not smart.
It's politics.

08:34.347 --> 08:37.043
I think I'm going to get tired
of this outfit.

08:37.117 --> 08:40.211
Seeing as I only have three
for the rest of my life.

08:40.287 --> 08:41.720
That looks fine.

08:42.822 --> 08:43.846
Fine?

08:44.758 --> 08:46.851
It looks great.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.886
You don't know anything
about women, do you?

08:52.933 --> 08:53.922
Shall we?

08:54.000 --> 08:55.934
Let's go be "presidential."

08:56.336 --> 09:00.329
I am confident that I speak for the
entire fleet when I say thank you.

09:00.407 --> 09:02.432
Without your
extraordinary dedication...

09:02.509 --> 09:05.501
your tireless effort,
your sacrifice...

09:05.946 --> 09:08.176
no one of us
would be here today.

09:08.982 --> 09:11.951
I'm proud to serve
as your President. Thank you.

09:18.325 --> 09:19.519
Carry on.

09:19.593 --> 09:23.029
<i>Sir, the Virgon Express
is maneuvering alongside.</i>

09:23.096 --> 09:25.223
They're standing by
for unrep.

09:25.298 --> 09:27.027
Thank you very much, D.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.997
Officer of the Watch, you'll
proceed with the unrep, please.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.162
Aye, sir.

09:31.404 --> 09:32.496
If you'll step this way.

09:32.572 --> 09:33.561
Thank you.

09:33.640 --> 09:35.471
Excuse me, Chief.
A word with you, please.

09:35.542 --> 09:37.510
Yes, sir,
just one second.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.673
You know what?
Just do it. What's up?

09:42.415 --> 09:43.905
Got a problem.

09:43.984 --> 09:46.418
Yes, sir, Lieutenant, sir.

09:46.486 --> 09:49.512
I believe the navcon modules
are ready for inspection.

09:51.157 --> 09:54.422
<i>Virgon Express, Galactica.
We have you in visual contact.</i>

09:54.494 --> 09:56.359
<i>Maintain current course
and speed.</i>

09:56.429 --> 09:57.828
<i>(man)
Roger that, Galactica.</i>

09:57.897 --> 09:59.888
<i>Maintain current course
and speed.</i>

10:01.167 --> 10:05.570
Powering up stabilization
gyros 24A through 48C.

10:05.639 --> 10:09.541
<i>Galactica's water recycling
system is close to 100% effective.</i>

10:09.609 --> 10:13.272
For all intents and purposes, there's not
one drop of water that's wasted aboard.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.940
We have enough water for several
years before replenishing.

10:16.016 --> 10:16.983
I see.

10:17.050 --> 10:19.211
<i>Many of the ships
like the Virgon Express...</i>

10:19.285 --> 10:21.583
were not made
for long-term voyages.

10:22.055 --> 10:24.387
They'll have to tank off of us periodically.

10:24.457 --> 10:25.549
Right.

10:28.128 --> 10:32.792
Whatever it is, we're gonna
take care of it, okay? All right?

10:33.066 --> 10:36.092
Now, tell me what
happened. What's going on?

10:36.369 --> 10:38.803
There are at this moment
six G-4 detonators...

10:38.872 --> 10:41.670
missing from the small-arms
locker on Deck 15.

10:43.343 --> 10:46.278
Commander, ready to extend
the water boom.

10:47.380 --> 10:48.779
Excuse me.

10:54.888 --> 10:55.946
How's it going?

10:56.022 --> 10:58.252
Oh, boy, I feel like a...

10:59.159 --> 11:00.820
Tour guide?

11:01.094 --> 11:02.061
It shows?

11:02.128 --> 11:03.925
Well, she was a teacher.

11:04.631 --> 11:08.192
Probably sees all this as one
big educational experience.

11:08.702 --> 11:11.364
He thinks I'm a total idiot,
doesn't he?

11:11.438 --> 11:13.702
What? No, sir. No.

11:15.341 --> 11:16.433
It's all right.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.033
What are you telling me for?

11:18.111 --> 11:21.410
If munitions go missing, you got to
go tell the Master-at-Arms right now.

11:21.481 --> 11:22.505
I know that.

11:22.582 --> 11:24.641
You can't screw around
with stuff like this.

11:24.718 --> 11:26.913
I'm not screwing around, okay?

11:26.986 --> 11:28.681
The only reason
I didn't tell anybody...

11:28.755 --> 11:31.519
is 'cause they're gonna think
I'm the one who took them.

11:36.663 --> 11:38.255
How are things?

11:38.665 --> 11:39.689
Things are good.

11:39.766 --> 11:40.790
Good.

11:43.136 --> 11:44.660
You look good.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.099
I really like your hair.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.508
My hair?

11:56.583 --> 11:58.551
I don't know anything
about women.

11:58.618 --> 12:00.813
Madam President, if I may?

12:01.287 --> 12:03.778
I think you should know
that my father...

12:04.624 --> 12:07.889
Well, this entire ceremony
was his idea.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.155
I know.

12:09.929 --> 12:11.658
I think he's enjoying it.

12:12.632 --> 12:15.965
Actually, he hates protocol,
pomp, and all that.

12:19.205 --> 12:20.399
Really?

12:20.740 --> 12:22.401
He's making a gesture.

12:22.475 --> 12:25.239
Trying to make you
feel like the President.

12:30.917 --> 12:33.078
Open Valves 3 and 5.

12:38.725 --> 12:42.786
I took the one detonator
from the duffel, replaced it...

12:43.496 --> 12:45.691
and then I went back
to my quarters.

12:54.407 --> 12:55.431
Well...

12:55.742 --> 12:56.731
Ahem.

12:58.678 --> 13:02.307
You know what? You know
what? It's not your fault.

13:02.382 --> 13:05.078
Someone's obviously setting you
up to take the fall for something.

13:05.151 --> 13:06.311
That's what it is.

13:06.386 --> 13:09.651
You wake up somewhere, you don't
know how you got there or anything.

13:09.722 --> 13:13.624
You're drugged, or manipulated,
or who knows what. Something.

13:16.563 --> 13:17.928
What do we do?

13:19.265 --> 13:22.530
Because if I report what's happened,
they're gonna think I'm a Cylon agent.

13:22.602 --> 13:26.629
No, they're not. No. Why would
they think that? That's crazy.

13:26.706 --> 13:30.472
People are getting crazy,
okay? You've heard the rumors.

13:30.543 --> 13:33.706
Cylons who look like humans,
sleeper agents hiding in the fleet.

13:37.050 --> 13:38.608
Decompression alarm!

13:46.626 --> 13:48.457
Damage report, Mr. Gaeta.

13:48.528 --> 13:51.622
Ruptures in Tanks 3, 5, 7, 9...

13:51.698 --> 13:53.723
Straining on the unrep lines.
They're gonna blow.

13:53.800 --> 13:55.233
Release the lines.

13:55.301 --> 13:57.064
Veer away, starboard.

14:03.042 --> 14:05.806
Every tank on the port side
has ruptured.

14:05.879 --> 14:08.609
We're venting all our water
directly into space.

14:24.297 --> 14:27.494
CIC, it's DC One.
We're entering the tank.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.501
<i>Roger that, DC One.</i>

14:52.725 --> 14:55.888
Raptor 478, it's DC One.
I have you in my sights.

14:59.465 --> 15:02.195
Copy that, DC One,
I have you in sight.

15:02.268 --> 15:03.599
<i>Understood.</i>

15:04.070 --> 15:06.971
How's it look in there?
Can you tell what happened?

15:07.040 --> 15:08.803
Lieutenant, don't worry...

15:10.710 --> 15:13.838
about my team.
I've got things under control.

15:14.414 --> 15:17.679
Copy that, DC One. I feel
better knowing you're on it.

15:21.654 --> 15:23.815
Watch the light,
you're off target.

15:24.724 --> 15:26.487
How much water did we lose?

15:27.026 --> 15:31.588
Ten million JPs, sir. Almost 60%
of total potable water reserves.

15:32.799 --> 15:34.357
Emergency rations.

15:34.434 --> 15:37.961
Shut down laundry, showers,
anything nonessential immediately.

15:38.037 --> 15:39.095
Yes, sir.

15:39.172 --> 15:41.163
How long will
our water supplies last?

15:41.240 --> 15:43.936
<i>Aboard Galactica, about six days.</i>

15:44.344 --> 15:46.869
But one-third of
the other ships in the fleet

15:46.946 --> 15:48.641
were depending on us
for replenishment.

15:48.715 --> 15:53.118
If we don't find new supplies,
they'll run out of water in two days.

15:53.186 --> 15:55.381
One-third?
That's 16,000 people.

15:55.455 --> 15:56.786
Get the names of those ships.

15:56.856 --> 16:00.121
Tell their captains to go on
emergency rations immediately.

16:00.193 --> 16:02.127
There's gonna be riots
in those ships.

16:02.195 --> 16:06.063
Civilians don't like hearing they
can't take a bath, wash their clothes...

16:06.132 --> 16:08.430
or drink more than
a thimble a day.

16:08.501 --> 16:10.526
Thank you
for the warning, Colonel.

16:10.603 --> 16:11.968
That'll be all, Mr. Gaeta.

16:12.038 --> 16:13.801
One more thing. Lieutenant?

16:14.941 --> 16:18.502
Do you have any theories about
what may have caused the accident?

16:22.682 --> 16:25.879
There are many theories at
this point, Madam President.

16:27.887 --> 16:29.377
Do you have a guess?

16:30.923 --> 16:34.484
I tell my officers not to guess. I
prefer to wait until we have fact.

16:35.261 --> 16:36.728
Indulge me.

16:42.035 --> 16:43.935
Take a guess, Mr. Gaeta.

16:45.638 --> 16:48.664
I'd have to say the most
likely explanation is...

16:48.741 --> 16:53.075
that the tank was structurally weakened
during the Cylon nuclear detonation...

16:53.146 --> 16:57.105
during the first attack, and that
caused it to buckle and rupture.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.684
But it's too early
to say, sir.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.247
Interesting.

17:01.754 --> 17:02.846
Thank you, Lieutenant.

17:02.922 --> 17:04.048
Back to the matter at hand.

17:04.123 --> 17:07.024
I've ordered an astronomical
survey of nearby star systems...

17:07.093 --> 17:09.323
for potential water sources.
Colonel?

17:09.395 --> 17:10.327
Yes, sir.

17:16.669 --> 17:18.933
Chief, take a look at this.

17:23.242 --> 17:24.869
What do you got?

17:24.944 --> 17:26.002
Not sure.

17:27.013 --> 17:29.573
It looks like burn marks
from an explosive.

17:31.551 --> 17:32.984
What do you think?

17:38.825 --> 17:41.851
It's tough to tell.
It's pretty rusted out.

17:47.633 --> 17:50.898
Optical and x-ray telescopes
say there are five systems...

17:50.970 --> 17:52.961
within our
practical jump radius.

17:53.439 --> 17:57.705
All five have planetary bodies with
the potential for finding water...

17:57.777 --> 18:00.041
in either a liquid
or a frozen state.

18:00.480 --> 18:03.972
Put together a plan for Raptors
to scout each star system.

18:04.050 --> 18:06.314
I want the first launch
at 17:30.

18:06.385 --> 18:07.443
Yes, sir.

18:07.920 --> 18:11.913
Colonel, how likely are we to
find water on any of these planets?

18:11.991 --> 18:14.186
Now you want me to guess,
I take it.

18:15.428 --> 18:16.690
Colonel.

18:17.930 --> 18:18.919
Sir.

18:20.133 --> 18:24.866
My apologies, Madam President.
Difficult day for everyone.

18:25.037 --> 18:26.299
I understand.

18:26.539 --> 18:29.997
Most planets are just hunks
of rock or balls of gas.

18:30.076 --> 18:34.206
The galaxy's a pretty barren, desolate
place when you get right down to it.

18:34.547 --> 18:35.605
Thank you, Colonel.

18:35.681 --> 18:38.241
The water rationing will
make our supply problem worse.

18:38.317 --> 18:41.377
Dr. Baltar, please share
the results of your study.

18:45.892 --> 18:50.090
I've calculated that the rate of
consumption regarding basic foodstuffs...

18:50.163 --> 18:51.460
for the
civilian population...

18:51.531 --> 18:54.659
This is based on information
available to me at the time.

18:54.734 --> 18:59.296
The current civilian
population of 45,265...

18:59.372 --> 19:01.306
will require, at minimum...

19:01.641 --> 19:04.769
82 tons of grain,
85 tons of meat...

19:05.444 --> 19:09.210
119 tons of fruit,
304 tons of vegetables...

19:10.783 --> 19:13.616
and 2.5 million JPs of water.

19:13.686 --> 19:15.347
Is that per month?

19:16.656 --> 19:17.782
Per week.

19:28.467 --> 19:30.594
They found your Raptor.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.134
A few or a lot?

19:36.442 --> 19:38.967
That's what you get
for coming back for me.

19:40.413 --> 19:41.573
Frack.

19:41.714 --> 19:42.772
Yeah.

19:45.518 --> 19:48.009
I was sure they didn't
track me coming in.

19:49.622 --> 19:50.554
I know.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.022
I set the jiggers to pulse.

19:52.091 --> 19:53.251
I'm sure you did.

19:53.326 --> 19:57.023
I didn't set off any detection
grids, any dradis sweeps, or pingers.

19:58.965 --> 20:00.762
Never send a pilot
to do an ECO's job.

20:00.833 --> 20:02.198
I can do your job.

20:02.702 --> 20:06.331
I guess that's why the toasters are
crawling all over our ride out of here.

20:06.405 --> 20:07.895
I don't suppose
we have a Plan B.

20:07.974 --> 20:10.272
Plans B, C, D and E
are the same as Plan A.

20:10.343 --> 20:12.607
Get off the planet and get
back to the ship. Come on.

20:12.678 --> 20:13.667
Where are we going?

20:13.746 --> 20:15.941
Don't ask questions.
Just follow your pilot.

20:16.015 --> 20:17.107
Yes, sir.

20:22.822 --> 20:26.883
So far we've found five discrete
detonation points in the tank...

20:26.959 --> 20:30.087
and we believe
that there may be a sixth.

20:30.329 --> 20:34.766
I've suspected due to the size
of the residual scoring...

20:34.834 --> 20:36.665
and the burn points...

20:36.736 --> 20:40.172
that we are dealing
with a G-4 type explosive.

20:40.506 --> 20:43.873
So I requested a spot check
of all inventory...

20:43.943 --> 20:47.845
from the Master-at-Arms
and she indicated to me...

20:47.913 --> 20:51.679
that there are six detonators
missing from a small-arms locker...

20:51.751 --> 20:53.742
in the port flight pod.

20:54.520 --> 20:57.648
So one detonator may still be
unaccounted for.

20:58.090 --> 21:02.652
Have the Master-at-Arms post guards
at all small-arms lockers immediately.

21:03.362 --> 21:07.196
It's already done, sir. She also
has opened an investigation...

21:07.266 --> 21:10.360
into who may have
had access to that locker.

21:10.636 --> 21:14.572
However, due to spotty
record-keeping...

21:14.640 --> 21:18.132
and lax internal security
procedures since the attack...

21:18.210 --> 21:22.544
she believes that we may never
know who took the detonators.

21:27.086 --> 21:29.247
Chief, thank you very much.

21:29.322 --> 21:34.021
Everyone except for Col. Tigh,
Capt. Adama, and Dr. Baltar...

21:34.427 --> 21:35.792
are now released.

21:35.895 --> 21:40.161
Please remember this briefing
is strictly confidential.

21:52.645 --> 21:56.137
<i>There is at least one Cylon
aboard the Galactica.</i>

22:08.093 --> 22:10.584
How many people know
the Cylons look human?

22:11.129 --> 22:15.031
The rumor mill's been working overtime.
Half the ship's talking about it.

22:15.100 --> 22:18.160
There'll always be rumors. For most
people, that's all they'll ever be.

22:18.236 --> 22:20.670
I'm asking
how many people actually know?

22:22.240 --> 22:24.504
The five people in this room,
plus three Marines.

22:24.576 --> 22:27.477
Let's keep it that way.
Once this gets out officially...

22:27.546 --> 22:31.243
people will be accusing each other
of being Cylons for no reason at all.

22:31.316 --> 22:35.116
I agree. Dr. Baltar, how're we
doing on the screenings?

22:35.454 --> 22:36.443
The screenings?

22:36.521 --> 22:40.617
<i>You were supposed to be screening
Galactica crew for potential Cylon agents.</i>

22:43.362 --> 22:46.661
Do you remember the
first time you lied to a woman?

22:46.732 --> 22:49.428
Other than your mother,
that is.

22:49.501 --> 22:50.991
Other than my mother.

22:54.206 --> 22:57.642
Sherry Bennett.
Fourth grade.

22:57.843 --> 23:00.277
On the playground,
behind the band room.

23:00.579 --> 23:02.809
"If you show me yours,
I'll show you mine."

23:02.948 --> 23:06.281
She did. I did not.

23:07.285 --> 23:11.085
You know, I think I slept with her
actually, many years later, of course.

23:11.256 --> 23:12.348
Of course.

23:13.792 --> 23:15.623
Did she turn out
to be a beautiful woman?

23:15.694 --> 23:17.594
As a matter of fact,
she did.

23:18.063 --> 23:19.428
Very beautiful.

23:22.567 --> 23:24.660
But every woman
has her beauty...

23:27.672 --> 23:30.197
her feminine charms
that are hers and hers alone.

23:30.275 --> 23:31.435
<i>Doctor?</i>

23:35.313 --> 23:36.940
The screenings.

23:37.983 --> 23:41.350
To tell you the truth, there
are significant problems...

23:41.420 --> 23:44.287
with implementing
my Cylon detection method...

23:44.356 --> 23:46.256
<i>that I used
aboard Galactica previously...</i>

23:46.324 --> 23:49.020
and basically because I've run
out of natural resources.

23:49.094 --> 23:52.894
I need chemical compounds. For
example, the precursor test.

23:52.964 --> 23:56.661
I need large samples
of tetrahydrocycline...

23:56.735 --> 23:59.260
which I don't have to tell you...
Maybe I do have to tell you.

23:59.337 --> 24:01.168
But it's a highly volatile
compound-

24:01.239 --> 24:02.763
Let me stop you right there.

24:02.841 --> 24:07.471
Your intellect obviously
outstrips everyone in this room.

24:08.680 --> 24:11.740
But it's also obvious by the
way that you're talking...

24:12.751 --> 24:15.447
in order to make
large-scale screenings...

24:15.887 --> 24:19.721
you're going to need help,
staff, resources.

24:22.327 --> 24:26.627
Yes, that's exactly
what I'm saying. Exactly.

24:27.933 --> 24:30.128
Although, more staff?

24:30.202 --> 24:33.035
Someone snooping around,
watching your every move?

24:34.272 --> 24:37.571
Maybe it'll be a woman, you
could find her secret beauty.

24:37.776 --> 24:40.768
I'm going to assign
Lt. Gaeta to aid you...

24:41.680 --> 24:43.477
in anything
that you might need.

24:43.548 --> 24:44.913
So much for that.

24:47.185 --> 24:48.948
But the need for secrecy?

24:49.020 --> 24:52.854
Clearly, this falls into the
"absolutely necessary" category.

24:52.924 --> 24:56.519
Your screening techniques may
be critical to our very survival.

24:56.595 --> 24:59.655
Humanity's very survival
rests in your hands.

25:01.266 --> 25:04.201
Now, if only you had
an actual Cylon detector.

25:08.507 --> 25:09.769
This is a critical mission.

25:09.841 --> 25:13.208
We already have fights breaking out
on some ships over water rations.

25:13.278 --> 25:16.770
There's panic in the air. You don't
find water out there and find it soon-

25:16.848 --> 25:19.282
I understand, Captain.
We'll find it.

25:19.818 --> 25:21.115
Good hunting.

25:24.422 --> 25:25.354
Hey, Chief.

25:25.423 --> 25:26.685
Captain.

25:28.260 --> 25:29.625
Lieutenant.
Chief.

25:31.863 --> 25:33.660
I feel like my head's
about to explode.

25:33.765 --> 25:36.290
Just relax, calm down.
Focus on the mission.

25:36.368 --> 25:39.098
We'll take care of
everything when you get back.

25:40.105 --> 25:41.936
What about
the investigation?

25:42.007 --> 25:45.807
Master-at-Arms is running it. Don't
worry, there's no connection to you.

25:45.877 --> 25:49.244
In fact, there's no reason to believe
you had anything to do with it at all.

25:49.314 --> 25:50.781
I didn't.
I know.

25:51.449 --> 25:54.145
I would never do something
like that. Never.

25:54.486 --> 25:56.386
Sharon, I know.

25:58.290 --> 26:00.918
It's really important
you believe me on this.

26:01.526 --> 26:02.959
You do believe me, right?

26:03.028 --> 26:04.222
Absolutely.

26:05.931 --> 26:07.159
Yes, sir.

26:08.466 --> 26:10.457
Thank you, Chief.
Carry on.

26:13.939 --> 26:16.703
Please excuse me
for keeping you waiting.

26:17.175 --> 26:20.440
I was called into the engine
room. It'll just take a moment.

26:20.812 --> 26:22.541
That's all right.

26:23.682 --> 26:26.048
Sometime, I'd like to borrow
a book or two.

26:26.117 --> 26:29.678
<i>I only brought one with me
on the flight to Galactica.</i>

26:31.289 --> 26:32.847
What book?

26:33.892 --> 26:35.519
<i>A Murder on Picon.</i>

26:37.295 --> 26:39.320
I have a weakness
for mystery.

26:39.397 --> 26:41.058
<i>Ever read Dark Day?</i>

26:41.132 --> 26:43.600
Edward Prima.
I am embarrassed to say...

26:43.668 --> 26:47.126
it's one of those classics I've
never gotten around to reading.

26:54.946 --> 26:56.641
I think you'll enjoy it.

27:00.018 --> 27:01.383
Thank you.

27:03.021 --> 27:05.421
It may be a while
before I get this back to you.

27:05.490 --> 27:08.288
It's a gift. Never lend books.

27:10.061 --> 27:11.961
Well, then thank you
for the gift.

27:12.330 --> 27:14.890
I'm really looking forward
to working with you, Doctor.

27:14.966 --> 27:16.058
You have a friend.

27:16.134 --> 27:17.158
As am I, Lieutenant.

27:17.235 --> 27:19.203
I actually studied genetics
in college.

27:19.271 --> 27:21.432
I was planning on going
for my graduate degree...

27:21.506 --> 27:23.201
through the military
extension program.

27:23.275 --> 27:25.266
Wonderful.
Is that a card game?

27:27.012 --> 27:31.039
And the girl wins again.
Another round?

27:31.616 --> 27:33.811
Come on, guys.
Grace under pressure.

27:34.286 --> 27:37.847
Nothing like losing a little money to
take your mind off those 14-hour patrols.

27:37.922 --> 27:39.787
Mind if I sit in, Lieutenant?

27:39.858 --> 27:42.224
If you got the cubits,
we've got the chair.

27:42.294 --> 27:46.355
Of course if you've got anything to
drink, we'll take that in lieu of cash.

27:46.831 --> 27:49.197
You know
I don't have any money, but...

27:50.468 --> 27:53.198
this jacket must be worth
at least 15 cubits.

27:53.271 --> 27:56.468
It's made of the finest Caprican cloth,
warm in winter, cooling in summer.

27:56.541 --> 27:57.633
It'd look great on you.

27:57.709 --> 28:02.169
Anybody else got any civilian clothes
they'd be interested in putting on the table?

28:03.982 --> 28:05.574
Don't let me keep you.

28:11.723 --> 28:13.281
Col. Tigh was right.

28:13.358 --> 28:16.850
Rioting broke out on a cruise ship
when they reduced water rations.

28:16.928 --> 28:20.796
We need to demonstrate an ability to
maintain order. We need to do it now.

28:20.865 --> 28:24.357
We don't have extra manpower
for fleet security.

28:24.569 --> 28:28.335
You have the only armed,
disciplined force available.

28:28.473 --> 28:31.033
Yeah, but I'm not going
to be your policeman.

28:31.943 --> 28:35.071
There's a reason why you
separate military and the police.

28:35.146 --> 28:39.640
One fights the enemy of the state. The
other serves and protects the people.

28:40.685 --> 28:43.518
When the military
becomes both...

28:45.123 --> 28:48.388
then the enemies of the state
tend to become the people.

28:48.626 --> 28:52.619
I appreciate the complexity of the
issue and I won't let that happen.

28:57.469 --> 29:00.267
I'll send troops
to the cruise ship.

29:00.338 --> 29:02.568
Commander,
I won't let that happen.

29:13.084 --> 29:15.484
Beginning dradis one sweep.

29:15.553 --> 29:17.350
Beginning dradis two sweep.

29:17.856 --> 29:21.223
So I'm thinking that we should give this
lovely little rock of nothing a name.

29:21.292 --> 29:23.453
I'm thinking "Kimiko. "

29:24.329 --> 29:25.489
Kimiko?

29:25.563 --> 29:29.090
After a lovely little lady, in a lovely
little city, in a lovely little colony...

29:29.167 --> 29:30.600
that I used to know.

29:30.668 --> 29:31.726
Whatever.

29:48.986 --> 29:52.319
Sorry. So sorry. You had
such a good run, though.

29:53.624 --> 29:55.455
Looks like the bet's to me.

29:55.526 --> 29:58.757
I'll try and muddle through
for another round.

29:58.829 --> 30:02.060
I'm going to raise you five.

30:03.467 --> 30:07.028
No guts, no glory, Doctor.
I'll see your five...

30:07.104 --> 30:10.631
and raise you 20.

30:14.211 --> 30:15.940
Now it's just you and me.

30:16.347 --> 30:19.510
I'm not used to playing in
this kind of high-stakes game.

30:19.583 --> 30:21.813
It's not too late to bow out.

30:21.953 --> 30:25.912
Now there's an excellent suggestion.
And before proceeding any further...

30:26.123 --> 30:29.024
I should really examine
my motivations for doing so.

30:30.528 --> 30:33.895
Staying in the game, I run the
risk of losing my entire stake...

30:34.098 --> 30:36.498
and being humiliated in front
of these lovely people.

30:36.567 --> 30:39.263
"Humiliated" is a such
a strong word.

30:40.071 --> 30:42.471
"Embarrassed" would be
my choice.

30:43.007 --> 30:44.599
You do play rough, though,
don't you?

30:44.675 --> 30:46.199
A little too rough for you.

30:46.310 --> 30:49.871
My hand's not that strong. It wouldn't
take much to knock me out of the game.

30:49.947 --> 30:51.642
Well, thank you, Doctor.

30:55.987 --> 30:59.889
However,
without a little risk...

31:00.324 --> 31:04.454
life would be so dull,
wouldn't it? Calling.

31:07.131 --> 31:08.393
Ahem.

31:10.101 --> 31:11.432
Okay.

31:12.870 --> 31:13.859
Ahem.

31:15.306 --> 31:16.637
Three on a run.

31:20.845 --> 31:22.005
Full colors.

31:26.517 --> 31:28.508
Thank you all...

31:28.953 --> 31:31.581
for a most pleasant evening.

31:46.037 --> 31:47.299
A parting gift.

31:48.906 --> 31:52.307
Hand-rolled from some of the
finest fumarello leaf on Caprica.

31:55.312 --> 31:58.179
And it's also one of
the last left in the universe.

32:01.819 --> 32:02.911
Thank you.

32:07.491 --> 32:08.822
My pleasure.

32:17.134 --> 32:18.499
Excuse me.

32:27.812 --> 32:30.337
The Raptors have reported back
after three star systems.

32:30.414 --> 32:32.439
So far, all report negative
for water, sir.

32:32.516 --> 32:34.313
I just checked
with Astrometrics.

32:34.385 --> 32:36.819
They're coming up
with big goose eggs.

32:36.887 --> 32:40.186
There's no star systems within
the range of our telescopes...

32:40.257 --> 32:42.885
with planetary bodies
likely to have water on them.

32:42.960 --> 32:47.795
Sir. Another Raptor just checked
in. Negative on water as well.

32:48.132 --> 32:49.030
Who's left?

32:49.100 --> 32:50.829
Boomer and Crashdown, sir.

32:51.402 --> 32:53.597
If they come up negative
as well...

32:54.839 --> 32:56.534
What's our back-up plan?

32:57.241 --> 33:01.405
We jump to another sector and
start the search all over again.

33:04.348 --> 33:06.316
Needle in a haystack.

33:06.383 --> 33:09.352
More like grain of salt
on a beach.

33:17.061 --> 33:19.393
Still nothing and...

33:22.566 --> 33:23.794
more nothing.

33:26.237 --> 33:27.966
I've got nothing here, either.

33:32.510 --> 33:33.943
Then that's it.

33:34.812 --> 33:38.509
Five moons, five zeroes. I'm getting
thirsty just thinking about it.

33:46.056 --> 33:48.547
Hope somebody else
has more luck out there.

33:49.960 --> 33:51.120
Yeah.

33:51.896 --> 33:53.693
What's on your mind,
Boomer?

33:54.198 --> 33:57.861
I don't know.
I have this feeling.

34:00.571 --> 34:02.835
Let's run
that last sweep again.

34:03.774 --> 34:05.139
You're the boss.

34:06.143 --> 34:08.236
Beginning sweep 21.

34:08.779 --> 34:10.804
Beginning sweep 22.

34:15.119 --> 34:18.020
Boomer, I'm getting
nothing again. How about you?

34:25.429 --> 34:27.556
I'm having trouble saying it.

34:28.866 --> 34:30.390
What do you mean?

34:45.916 --> 34:47.645
I think I see...

34:52.623 --> 34:53.612
Oh.

34:54.291 --> 34:56.782
I have positive contact. Yeah.

34:59.296 --> 35:02.561
Oh, yes! Yeah!

35:04.235 --> 35:05.998
Good call, Boomer.

35:11.775 --> 35:14.369
Sir. Dradis just picked up
Boomer's Raptor.

35:14.445 --> 35:16.037
Let's hear it.

35:16.413 --> 35:18.005
<i>Galactica, Crashdown.</i>

35:18.082 --> 35:20.676
<i>Dradis sweeps indicate it's time
to break out the swimtrunks...</i>

35:20.751 --> 35:24.346
<i>because we've found water.
Repeat. Positive water contact.</i>

35:32.129 --> 35:34.654
Patch me in
to the entire fleet.

35:39.670 --> 35:41.262
You're connected, sir.

35:42.239 --> 35:44.332
<i>Attention.
This is the Commander.</i>

35:45.175 --> 35:46.938
<i>We have found water.</i>

35:53.817 --> 35:55.409
Let's go have a drink.

35:56.120 --> 35:59.886
I think they're pleased. I can hear
them screaming in the background.

36:28.952 --> 36:30.920
(Helo) Sharon, careful with that needle.

36:30.988 --> 36:33.548
We're running low
on anti-radiation meds.

36:40.030 --> 36:42.123
Not really mom's home cooking.

36:42.199 --> 36:44.531
Yeah? It beats eating grass
and leaves.

36:44.601 --> 36:48.503
We'll be cooking up a fine meal of
twigs and moss by the end of the week.

36:48.572 --> 36:49.766
You spoil me.

36:54.511 --> 36:58.743
Can I ask you something, Sharon?
Why'd you come back for me?

37:00.951 --> 37:02.543
I hate to fly alone.

37:05.589 --> 37:10.253
Come on. You disobeyed orders,
flew back into this hellhole...

37:11.061 --> 37:13.757
and not that I don't
appreciate it, but why?

37:16.967 --> 37:20.130
I just couldn't leave you
behind. Let's leave it at that.

37:32.716 --> 37:34.616
<i>It's a Colonial fleet signal.</i>

37:36.720 --> 37:38.745
I can't decode it,
but it means there's someone.

37:38.822 --> 37:42.519
Someone in the military is still
alive and kicking here in Caprica.

37:42.593 --> 37:43.719
Yes.

38:03.313 --> 38:05.474
Now all we have to do
is find them.

38:15.926 --> 38:17.894
Way to go, Boomer.

38:17.961 --> 38:19.360
Nice work, sir.

38:21.231 --> 38:23.426
Nice job.
Let's get you debriefed.

38:23.500 --> 38:24.762
Yes, sir.

38:28.839 --> 38:32.275
Chief. You think you could take
a look at my ejection pyros?

38:32.342 --> 38:34.435
I think there's a short
or something. Yeah. Cally.

38:34.511 --> 38:37.571
No, Chief. You could take
a look at it yourself.

38:55.666 --> 38:57.827
<i>Thank you for coming,
Capt. Apollo.</i>

38:57.901 --> 39:00.301
I am aware that you were
in charge...

39:00.370 --> 39:03.339
<i>of the mission that destroyed
the Olympic Carrier.</i>

39:04.041 --> 39:08.239
I know what a hard thing that
is to live with, for all of us.

39:08.912 --> 39:11.244
I'm struggling
with it myself, frankly.

39:11.582 --> 39:13.743
I can't stop thinking
about it.

39:16.954 --> 39:21.857
But a man has to accept
responsibility for his actions.

39:21.925 --> 39:24.485
He doesn't second-guess
the choices he makes.

39:25.929 --> 39:27.863
He lives with them. Every day.

39:29.933 --> 39:34.097
You know, I remember when President
Adar sent the Marines into Aerilon.

39:34.171 --> 39:35.798
Fifteen people died.

39:36.340 --> 39:40.208
In public, of course, he had
to say all the usual things.

39:40.544 --> 39:44.002
He was sure of what he'd done,
he made the right choice...

39:44.081 --> 39:45.946
he stayed the course.

39:46.717 --> 39:48.810
But he knew it was a mistake.

39:50.053 --> 39:54.012
And he kept the names of
the dead in his desk drawer.

39:54.625 --> 39:57.617
He said that it was imperative
for a leader...

39:58.395 --> 40:01.125
to remember and learn
from the mistakes...

40:01.832 --> 40:04.665
even if they can't admit
to them publicly.

40:05.369 --> 40:07.496
You think we made a mistake?

40:08.472 --> 40:09.871
I don't know.

40:13.911 --> 40:17.904
I don't have a desk drawer
yet, but I have a pocket.

40:29.760 --> 40:33.218
I don't want to add
to your burdens, however.

40:34.565 --> 40:36.089
I have a request.

40:36.266 --> 40:39.565
I would like you to be
my personal military advisor.

40:41.605 --> 40:42.902
I'm sorry.

40:44.074 --> 40:47.942
My father is the senior military
officer. He should advise you.

40:48.011 --> 40:52.675
No, I don't mean to go behind your
father's back. Nothing like that.

40:53.383 --> 40:58.047
I'm not looking for military advice. I'm
looking for advice about the military.

40:58.488 --> 41:02.857
That little insight about your father
making a gesture, that really helped me.

41:03.427 --> 41:07.659
It made me reassess the man. I would
appreciate more of those insights.

41:09.066 --> 41:11.796
And you can keep your day job
at the C-A-G.

41:12.903 --> 41:14.666
It's pronounced "CAG."

41:16.306 --> 41:18.240
Do you see why I need you?

41:21.745 --> 41:24.236
So who's going to tell
my father?

41:24.615 --> 41:25.775
Well...

41:29.853 --> 41:31.821
I was thinking that...

41:33.123 --> 41:35.318
that would be
your first assignment.

41:37.694 --> 41:40.959
Somehow, I knew
you were going to say that.

41:41.431 --> 41:42.898
Thank you, Captain.

41:47.638 --> 41:48.662
Hey.

41:56.847 --> 41:57.973
That is just what I needed.

41:58.048 --> 41:59.106
Oh, yeah?

42:01.184 --> 42:02.708
Did you find that detonator?

42:02.786 --> 42:03.718
Yes, I did.

42:03.787 --> 42:04.947
I gave it to Master-at-Arms.

42:05.022 --> 42:05.954
What?

42:06.023 --> 42:08.617
No, no. I told her
I found it during maintenance.

42:08.692 --> 42:13.425
Listen, calm down. This is the
best way to go about this. Okay?

42:13.497 --> 42:15.522
That puts them
on the same trail we're on...

42:15.599 --> 42:17.863
and it doesn't raise
any suspicion of you.

42:17.934 --> 42:20.368
Listen.
Trust me on this, Sharon.

42:20.771 --> 42:23.604
I'm not going to let anything
happen to you. Okay?

42:24.641 --> 42:25.665
Okay.

42:25.742 --> 42:27.073
All right, okay.

42:29.046 --> 42:30.570
Don't worry, sweetie.

42:32.716 --> 42:34.081
I better go.

42:34.151 --> 42:35.243
Okay.
