deal, round one, and I need you

22:25.458 --> 22:27.928
to bring me that raw, so we can

22:27.928 --> 22:30.463
put her feet into it, so we can

22:30.463 --> 22:31.732
take the measurements, and then

22:31.732 --> 22:33.166
you stick it in the oven and

you bake it.

37:40.707 --> 37:42.809
So, Rusev and I invite Brie,

37:42.809 --> 37:44.778
Lana and Bryan to lunch, so

37:44.778 --> 37:45.646
we're not, like, giving away the

37:45.646 --> 37:46.747
surprise.

37:46.747 --> 37:47.848
Doesn't this look perfect?

37:47.848 --> 37:49.049
>> RUSEV: Yeah, this is amazing.

37:49.049 --> 37:50.383
Hello!

37:50.383 --> 37:51.451
>> NIKKI: I have to say this

37:51.451 --> 37:52.953
turned out really cute.

37:52.953 --> 37:54.354
Oh, Nana.

37:54.354 --> 37:55.622
Good to see you. Mwah!

37:55.622 --> 37:57.123
>> BRIE: Hi, baby.

37:57.123 --> 38:00.834
You had a nice nap.

38:00.834 --> 38:01.968
>> RUSEV: All right, here we go.

38:04.838 --> 38:06.106
Okay, they're coming, they're

38:06.106 --> 38:07.508
coming, they're coming.

38:07.508 --> 38:08.709
>> NIKKI: I'm definitely a bit

38:08.709 --> 38:09.643
nervous.

38:09.643 --> 38:11.044
If this party ends up, like, not

38:11.044 --> 38:12.445
working out, I'd feel bad, but

38:12.445 --> 38:13.947
I'm gonna have to blame Rusev.

38:13.947 --> 38:17.117
>> RUSEV: Okay, any second.

38:17.117 --> 38:20.754
>> ALL: Surprise!

38:20.754 --> 38:21.988
(applause)

38:21.988 --> 38:23.524
>> NIKKI: Bir Bir.

38:23.524 --> 38:25.592
>> BRIE: Did your Auntie Coco

38:25.592 --> 38:26.793
throw you a birthday?

38:26.793 --> 38:28.394
(indistinct chatter)

38:28.394 --> 38:29.596
>> BRYAN: You guys do realize

38:29.596 --> 38:31.397
it's like a‐a month after?

38:31.397 --> 38:32.465
>> NIKKI: Rusev's idea.

38:32.465 --> 38:34.768
>> BRIE: Surprise!

38:34.768 --> 38:36.570
Birdie's 13‐month birthday

38:36.570 --> 38:37.938
party?

38:37.938 --> 38:40.273
>> NIKKI: Oh, no.

38:40.273 --> 38:41.241
>> BRIE: Look how amazing you

38:41.241 --> 38:43.309
look.

38:43.309 --> 38:46.246
So, do you remember when I said

38:46.246 --> 38:47.180
Birdie doesn't need a birthday

38:47.180 --> 38:48.181
party?

38:48.181 --> 38:49.015
>> NIKKI: Yeah, Brie, I do

38:49.015 --> 38:49.950
remember.

38:49.950 --> 38:50.851
You guys were in training, you

38:50.851 --> 38:51.718
left Rusev and I alone.

38:51.718 --> 38:52.953
And that's probably the first

38:52.953 --> 38:53.787
time I've ever hung out with him

38:53.787 --> 38:54.721
by myself.

38:54.721 --> 38:56.790
And he kind of had the idea.

38:56.790 --> 38:57.758
and I was like, "Yeah, that'd be

38:57.758 --> 38:58.892
really cool."

38:58.892 --> 39:00.333
And you do have to admit, he

39:00.333 --> 39:02.503
brought up how big it is for a

39:02.503 --> 39:04.237
child to make it to one.

39:04.237 --> 39:05.205
>> BRIE: I know, but she won't

39:05.205 --> 39:06.206
ever remember.

39:06.206 --> 39:07.040
>> NIKKI: But when he started

39:07.040 --> 39:08.041
talking about it, I was like,

39:08.041 --> 39:08.975
"That's really cute."

39:08.975 --> 39:10.076
>> BRIE: I mean, it is.

39:10.076 --> 39:11.912
This is nice, but I just don't

39:11.912 --> 39:12.846
want Birdie to think, like,

39:12.846 --> 39:13.914
every birthday's gonna be lavish

39:13.914 --> 39:15.882
and big.

39:15.882 --> 39:17.183
I like simple.

39:17.183 --> 39:18.552
>> NIKKI: This is very simple

39:18.552 --> 39:19.786
from what it was gonna be.

39:19.786 --> 39:21.454
>> LANA: I can imagine.

39:21.454 --> 39:22.488
>> RUSEV: We're gonna have to

39:22.488 --> 39:23.456
definitely move some furniture

39:23.456 --> 39:24.324
around.

39:24.324 --> 39:25.191
I think we can hang some

39:25.191 --> 39:28.595
Bulgarian, like, flags.

39:28.595 --> 39:29.530
>> NIKKI: Well, maybe, I think‐‐

39:29.530 --> 39:30.430
>> RUSEV: Maybe we can serve

39:30.430 --> 39:31.231
some traditional dishes from

39:31.231 --> 39:32.132
Bulgaria.

39:32.132 --> 39:33.433
>> BRIE: The one thing I do like

39:33.433 --> 39:34.968
is that my husband was on the

39:34.968 --> 39:36.903
road for Birdie's birthday, so I

39:36.903 --> 39:38.171
feel like this birthday party

39:38.171 --> 39:39.706
makes him feel like he's a part

39:39.706 --> 39:40.874
of her birthday, which is really

39:40.874 --> 39:42.843
cute, 'cause he was so sad he

39:42.843 --> 39:44.110
missed it.

39:44.110 --> 39:46.079
Rusev and Nikki get, like, some

39:46.079 --> 39:47.948
big points for that.

39:47.948 --> 39:50.016
♪ ♪

39:52.185 --> 39:54.087
>> RUSEV: So, this is a bread

39:54.087 --> 39:55.822
with Birdie's feet in it.

39:55.822 --> 39:56.757
>> NIKKI: Hey, Birdie.

39:56.757 --> 39:58.024
To you being one.

39:58.024 --> 40:01.234
>> BRYAN: Yay...

40:04.304 --> 40:05.371
>> RUSEV: All right, me and

40:05.371 --> 40:06.339
Nicole chose professions for

40:06.339 --> 40:07.107
Birdie.

40:07.107 --> 40:07.974
>> NIKKI: A musician.

40:07.974 --> 40:08.875
>> RUSEV: I got a dumbbell, for

40:08.875 --> 40:09.776
a weightlifter.

40:09.776 --> 40:10.644
>> NIKKI: Chef.

40:10.644 --> 40:11.411
>> RUSEV: Police officer.

40:11.411 --> 40:12.345
Artist/painter.

40:12.345 --> 40:13.413
And a WWE woman wrestler.

40:13.413 --> 40:14.815
>> BRIE: Yeah, nice.

40:14.815 --> 40:15.982
>> RUSEV: Let's see what she

40:15.982 --> 40:16.917
gets.

40:16.917 --> 40:17.918
Oh, here we go.

40:17.918 --> 40:19.085
Here we go!

40:19.085 --> 40:21.154
That was so easy.

40:21.154 --> 40:23.056
You're going to be a chef.

40:23.056 --> 40:24.825
>> BRIE: Yay, a chef.

40:24.825 --> 40:28.228
Chef Bir Bir.

40:31.164 --> 40:33.834
>> LANA: Oh, a little Barbie.

40:36.236 --> 40:37.170
>> RUSEV: What do you think

40:37.170 --> 40:38.071
about the party?

40:38.071 --> 40:39.172
>> LANA: I think it's great.

40:39.172 --> 40:40.273
>> RUSEV: Do you?

40:40.273 --> 40:41.374
>> LANA: Mm‐hmm.

40:41.374 --> 40:43.209
We have to talk, though.

40:43.209 --> 40:44.611
I'm really nervous to talk to

40:44.611 --> 40:45.779
Rusev.

40:45.779 --> 40:47.080
Is he gonna resent me?

40:47.080 --> 40:48.314
Like, if I don't give him a

40:48.314 --> 40:49.816
baby, is he later gonna look

40:49.816 --> 40:51.852
back on me and resent me that I

40:51.852 --> 40:54.855
wasn't this... perfect Bulgarian

40:54.855 --> 40:57.023
wife that cooked, cleaned and

40:57.023 --> 40:58.424
listened?

40:58.424 --> 41:00.901
So, what‐what is it?

41:00.901 --> 41:01.935
I mean, what, you would want to

41:01.935 --> 41:02.903
have...

41:02.903 --> 41:03.804
I mean, I would have to give up

41:03.804 --> 41:05.305
my dreams right now to have a

41:05.305 --> 41:06.707
baby, and then, what, you're

41:06.707 --> 41:08.241
gonna be a stay‐home dad and

41:08.241 --> 41:10.811
take care of the baby?

41:10.811 --> 41:12.078
Or we're both working, and our

41:12.078 --> 41:14.515
mothers and fathers take care?

41:14.515 --> 41:15.749
That's not fair to the baby.

41:15.749 --> 41:18.151
Look how much they're connected

41:18.151 --> 41:19.686
to their child.

41:19.686 --> 41:20.621
Don't you want to be really

41:20.621 --> 41:21.755
great parents?

41:21.755 --> 41:23.023
>> RUSEV: Sure. I don't want to

41:23.023 --> 41:25.992
be away.

41:25.992 --> 41:27.794
But‐But we're not gonna have a

41:27.794 --> 41:30.897
child, so...

41:30.897 --> 41:31.865
>> LANA: We're not having a

41:31.865 --> 41:32.833
child now?

41:32.833 --> 41:35.802
>> RUSEV: No.

41:35.802 --> 41:37.070
We can't.

41:37.070 --> 41:38.271
>> LANA: Why?

41:38.271 --> 41:39.205
>> RUSEV: Because you have

41:39.205 --> 41:42.242
dreams and ambitions.

41:45.846 --> 41:49.115
It's too selfish if I do that.

41:49.115 --> 41:50.684
Like, I can't imagine, my dream

41:50.684 --> 41:51.885
was to go to America, and,

41:51.885 --> 41:53.053
"Hey, don't follow your dream

41:53.053 --> 41:54.220
for nine months, and see what

41:54.220 --> 41:55.488
happens after."

41:55.488 --> 41:56.623
It's your time, you're doing

41:56.623 --> 41:57.758
great, you're getting better and

41:57.758 --> 41:58.992
better, so maybe we should

41:58.992 --> 42:00.901
wait.

42:00.901 --> 42:02.435
>> LANA: I did not expect that.

42:02.435 --> 42:03.637
I'm so thankful that he is so

42:03.637 --> 42:05.672
supportive of my career.

42:05.672 --> 42:08.441
You're so sweet.

42:08.441 --> 42:09.943
I love you.

42:09.943 --> 42:10.711
>> RUSEV: I'm so sweet.

42:10.711 --> 42:11.645
>> LANA: You're the best husband

42:11.645 --> 42:12.478
ever.

42:12.478 --> 42:13.413
>> RUSEV: Even though my plan

42:13.413 --> 42:14.748
was to take you here so you can

42:14.748 --> 42:15.849
fall in love with babies and all

42:15.849 --> 42:16.883
that.

42:16.883 --> 42:18.451
But I feel like I was trying to

42:18.451 --> 42:19.986
undermine you a little bit,

42:19.986 --> 42:21.387
which is not a cool deal.

42:21.387 --> 42:23.056
>> LANA: Oh, you're so sweet.

42:23.056 --> 42:24.525
I love you.

42:24.525 --> 42:26.192
I also do this for my future

42:26.192 --> 42:28.028
daughter and my future son,

42:28.028 --> 42:29.395
to show them to chase their

42:29.395 --> 42:30.196
dreams.

42:30.196 --> 42:30.997
>> RUSEV: All right, let's go

42:30.997 --> 42:31.765
party.

42:31.765 --> 42:32.999
All right, let's go...

42:32.999 --> 42:35.035
take some Fireball shots.

42:35.035 --> 42:36.903
>> BRIE: Birdie, dog.

42:36.903 --> 42:38.572
What does a dog do?

42:38.572 --> 42:39.840
(Birdie barks)

42:39.840 --> 42:40.874
>> NIKKI: Yeah. That's the

42:40.874 --> 42:41.808
cute‐‐

42:41.808 --> 42:44.645
(laughter)

42:44.645 --> 42:46.547
>> RUSEV: Hello there, Birdie.

42:46.547 --> 42:47.714
>> NIKKI: Oh, my God, look at

42:47.714 --> 42:48.782
the quads.

42:48.782 --> 42:49.683
>> RUSEV: I'm gonna make you

42:49.683 --> 42:50.951
some animals.

42:50.951 --> 42:52.485
>> LANA: Rusev is gonna make an

42:52.485 --> 42:54.087
amazing dad, I know that.

42:54.087 --> 42:55.989
And in everything I do, I give

42:55.989 --> 42:58.525
it 1,000 percent.

42:58.525 --> 43:00.466
And so, when the time is right,

43:00.466 --> 43:01.702
we will be incredible parents

43:01.702 --> 43:02.769
together.

43:02.769 --> 43:03.604
>> RUSEV: You want to take a

43:03.604 --> 43:04.538
picture?

43:04.538 --> 43:05.539
>> BRIE: Because you have Daddy.

43:05.539 --> 43:06.973
(Rusev laughing)

43:06.973 --> 43:08.341
>> RUSEV: She's like, "No!"

43:08.341 --> 43:10.210
(laughter)

43:10.210 --> 43:12.513
>> NIA: Next on <i>Total Divas...</i>

43:12.513 --> 43:13.446
>> BRIE: Party time!

43:13.446 --> 43:14.314
>> NIKKI: Lake Tahoe!

43:14.314 --> 43:15.448
I wanted this to be very much

43:15.448 --> 43:16.583
a bonding trip for all of us

43:16.583 --> 43:17.784
girls.

43:17.784 --> 43:19.285
>> PAIGE: I deserve it 'cause of

43:19.285 --> 43:20.587
the (bleep) (bleep) year I had!

43:20.587 --> 43:21.321
>> MAN: You okay, sweetie?

43:21.321 --> 43:22.122
>> LANA: You're a freakin'

43:22.122 --> 43:22.989
bitch.

43:22.989 --> 43:24.090
Whoo!

43:24.090 --> 43:25.025
>> TRINITY: Atlanta.

43:25.025 --> 43:25.892
I want us to move there.

43:25.892 --> 43:26.660
>> JON: Wait, what?

43:26.660 --> 43:27.961
All you do is bury Pensacola.

43:27.961 --> 43:28.895
You don't like it there.

43:28.895 --> 43:29.796
>> PAIGE: Just go (bleep)

43:29.796 --> 43:31.097
yourself, I'm done with people

43:31.097 --> 43:32.899
(bleep) talking to me like that.

43:32.899 --> 43:35.235
>> NIA: What the hell happened?

43:35.235 --> 43:36.236
>> PAIGE: You're a stupid bitch.
