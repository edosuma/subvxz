<i>Previously on "The Secret
Life of the American Teenagers"...</i>

00:03.822 --> 00:06.157
You're way, way too young
to be moving in with a guy.

00:06.225 --> 00:07.925
It's not just me moving in
with a guy,

00:07.993 --> 00:10.695
it's my son, John, and me
moving in with his father
and my boyfriend.

00:10.763 --> 00:12.030
You guys are my best friends.

00:12.097 --> 00:13.831
But you have
a new best friend.
Adrian.

00:13.899 --> 00:16.200
That's not gonna change anything
between the three of us.

00:16.268 --> 00:17.535
Yeah, it probably will.

00:17.603 --> 00:20.505
Have you and Ben
talked seriously about finances?

00:20.572 --> 00:22.874
Is there a prenup?
You think he wants a prenup?

00:22.941 --> 00:25.043
I wanna do it!
When I'm ready.

00:25.110 --> 00:27.912
I think you're gonna feel better
about me if I stop putting
the pressure on you.

00:27.980 --> 00:31.015
You think we're still
gonna want our own place
after nine years of college?

00:31.083 --> 00:33.084
After nine years
of having sex?

00:33.152 --> 00:36.020
Yeah. As long as we don't make
the whole relationship
about sex.

00:36.021 --> 00:37.555
I had a really nice ti.

00:39.491 --> 00:42.727
Yeah. As long So you liked it?
the whole relationship
Uh, yes, I liked it.

00:42.795 --> 00:44.328
Feeling better
about getting married

00:44.396 --> 00:46.297
and spending
the rest of your life
with me and your daughter?

00:46.365 --> 00:48.933
Much, much, much better.

00:49.001 --> 00:51.069
I'm being completely honest
with you, so...

00:51.136 --> 00:53.771
I don't think I'm ready
to move in just right yet.

00:53.839 --> 00:56.441
I love you, Amy.

00:56.508 --> 00:58.376
I love you, too, Ricky.

What do you think?
You look pretty.

01:21.166 --> 01:23.101
Yeah, I kind of like this one.

01:23.168 --> 01:25.470
Yeah, it's-- it's nice.

01:25.537 --> 01:27.638
But?
No, it's nice.

01:27.706 --> 01:29.307
Well, should I get it?

01:29.374 --> 01:30.775
I don't know.
Is it inour price range?

01:30.843 --> 01:32.443
I don't really have
a price range.

01:32.511 --> 01:33.778
Well, is it reasonable?

01:33.846 --> 01:35.546
No, it's completely
unreasonable,

01:35.614 --> 01:37.715
but, well, I'm only
gonna do this once.

01:37.783 --> 01:39.784
And...I want a wedding dress.

01:39.852 --> 01:40.918
[footsteps]

01:43.689 --> 01:47.024
I have never seen that dress
look better on anyone.

01:47.092 --> 01:48.693
Really?

01:49.862 --> 01:52.730
Darling, that is superb.

01:52.798 --> 01:53.931
[chuckles]

01:53.999 --> 01:54.966
You think?

01:55.033 --> 01:57.702
Is there any way
it could be altered

01:57.770 --> 01:59.704
to...fit?

01:59.772 --> 02:01.739
'Cause the wedding
is only three weeks away.

02:01.807 --> 02:04.609
I'll get our seamstress.
I'm sure she can make it fit.

02:04.676 --> 02:07.111
Yeah, but if it fits now,
it probably won't fit
in three weeks.

02:07.179 --> 02:10.914
Maybe there's something
in an Empire waist
we can do something with.

02:10.983 --> 02:12.483
Let me go check our stock.

02:12.551 --> 02:15.353
There's no time for custom here.
I'll be right back.

02:15.420 --> 02:17.822
Oh, I can't believe
I'm getting married!

02:17.890 --> 02:19.490
It's really exciting.

02:19.558 --> 02:21.859
I wish we had time off
from school so we
can go on a honeymoon.

02:21.927 --> 02:23.761
Yeah, that would be nice.

02:23.829 --> 02:26.764
Of course,
we kind of had

02:26.832 --> 02:29.200
a honeymoon last weekend
when we were setting up
the nursery.

02:29.268 --> 02:31.502
Meaning?
Okay.

02:31.570 --> 02:33.471
I told Ben
I wouldn't tell anyone,

02:33.539 --> 02:35.006
but we did it.

02:35.073 --> 02:36.007
Did what?

02:36.074 --> 02:37.508
You know what.

02:37.576 --> 02:39.277
Last weekend, in the nursery,

02:39.344 --> 02:42.180
when we were unpacking
the baby bed
and putting it together.

02:42.247 --> 02:43.714
And it was amazing.

02:43.782 --> 02:45.316
You had sex?

02:45.384 --> 02:48.152
Yeah, we had sex.
Maybe the best sex
of my entire life.

02:48.220 --> 02:50.154
Wasn't it kind of,
like, awkward?

02:50.222 --> 02:53.357
No. And you wanna know why?
Because that Ben is crazy.

02:53.425 --> 02:54.992
Crazy?
Yeah.

02:55.060 --> 02:56.928
You know, it's the quiet ones
that'll surprise you.

02:56.995 --> 02:58.663
Look, I don't know
what's going on with him.

02:58.730 --> 03:01.265
I don't know if he's been
doing some research
or he's just inspired,

03:01.333 --> 03:03.501
but he is a whole lot of fun.

03:03.569 --> 03:05.670
Oh, my.

03:05.737 --> 03:07.672
Yeah, oh, my.

03:07.739 --> 03:10.641
Girl, do you have any idea
how happy I am?

03:10.709 --> 03:12.643
I mean, that was my one concern
that the two of us

03:12.711 --> 03:14.879
wouldn't get along in that way,
but we do.

03:14.947 --> 03:16.981
I mean, he is crazy fun.

03:17.049 --> 03:18.916
Just crazy!

03:18.984 --> 03:20.551
And I get to spend
my life with him.

03:20.619 --> 03:23.354
Like, I just--
I don't know how
I got so lucky.

03:23.422 --> 03:26.023
I mean...
[sighs]

03:26.091 --> 03:27.458
I just...

03:27.526 --> 03:29.927
I don't know what I did
to deserve all this happiness.

03:29.995 --> 03:33.197
I feel like God
has blessed me.

03:34.867 --> 03:37.034
You know, maybe we should
be getting married in a church.

03:37.102 --> 03:38.703
Because the sex is so good?

03:38.770 --> 03:41.706
Not just good,
walk-on-water good.

03:41.773 --> 03:43.708
Do you know of any church
where we could get married?

03:43.775 --> 03:45.042
Not really.

03:45.110 --> 03:47.078
I mean, we don't have
a minister at our church.

03:47.145 --> 03:49.513
We've just been having
guest ministers
ever since Jack's dad left.

03:49.581 --> 03:52.350
Oh. Jack's dad. Great idea.

03:52.417 --> 03:54.685
Um, well, do you think
he'd marry us at your church?

03:54.753 --> 03:56.687
I thought the judge
who married your parents
was gonna marry you.

03:56.755 --> 03:58.656
Yeah, but I don't want
our marriage

03:58.724 --> 04:00.157
to just be a legal thing.

04:00.225 --> 04:02.860
You can always undo
legal things.

04:02.928 --> 04:05.229
I want our marriage
to be an eternal thing.

04:05.297 --> 04:07.531
I wanna have that kind of sex
for eternity.

04:07.599 --> 04:10.468
You know, there are other ways
to show your love for each other

04:10.535 --> 04:12.570
other than having hot sex.

04:12.638 --> 04:14.205
What about romance?

04:14.273 --> 04:16.707
Uh-oh.
[sighs]

04:16.774 --> 04:18.476
Things aren't going well
with Grant already?

04:22.014 --> 04:24.315
Okay, princess,
let's get you into something

04:24.383 --> 04:28.052
that hot prince is gonna
wanna rip off.

04:29.755 --> 04:31.789
[whispering]
You told her?
[whispering]
Crazy.

05:04.586 --> 05:05.553
Hi.

05:05.620 --> 05:07.421
Hi, Grace.

05:07.489 --> 05:09.690
So, do you mind if I come in?

05:09.758 --> 05:11.359
Oh. No, no, no. Please.

05:11.426 --> 05:13.160
Um, I was just cleaning up

05:13.228 --> 05:15.096
'cause my dad and Ashley

05:15.163 --> 05:17.098
ran out to get school supplies
after dinner

05:17.165 --> 05:19.467
and left me with this.
[chuckles]

05:19.534 --> 05:21.969
Um, and I just picked up
John from the nursery.

05:22.037 --> 05:24.438
Oh, here. Have a seat.
I'll get you a drink.

05:24.506 --> 05:27.274
Oh, no. I'm fine.
I just had dinner with Adrian.

05:27.342 --> 05:30.211
We just went and grabbed a bite
after we went shopping
for wedding dresses.

05:30.278 --> 05:33.214
Oh, that must've been fun.
Yeah, it was really fun.

05:33.281 --> 05:34.715
Great.
[chuckles]

05:34.783 --> 05:36.217
She doesn't want
a big wedding,

05:36.284 --> 05:38.119
but she wants a really big
wedding dress.

05:38.186 --> 05:41.122
Does she have any other choice?
[laughs]
Funny.

05:41.189 --> 05:43.791
I thought she and Ben
weren't doing any of that stuff

05:43.859 --> 05:45.259
because they're getting a condo.

05:45.327 --> 05:47.228
Yeah, but her dad said
he'd pay for the dress

05:47.295 --> 05:48.929
and the flowers and the cake
d all that.

05:48.997 --> 05:50.631
That's nice.
I know it seems

05:50.699 --> 05:52.400
as if she and Ben
have everything,

05:52.467 --> 05:54.535
because Ben is Ben,

05:54.603 --> 05:56.871
but I just thought
I'd drop by and--

05:56.938 --> 05:59.573
and ask if you think
that we should throw her
a shower.

05:59.641 --> 06:01.575
I hadn't even
thought about that.

06:01.643 --> 06:03.511
She and I threw you
a baby shower,

06:03.578 --> 06:06.080
so I thought maybe you and I
should throw her a baby shower.

06:06.148 --> 06:08.482
Yeah. Uh...

06:08.550 --> 06:09.850
[chuckles]

06:09.918 --> 06:12.019
Um, yeah, I guess
we should do that.

06:12.087 --> 06:14.422
Or I can just do it myself
if you don't want to.

06:16.825 --> 06:19.226
I totally understand.

06:19.294 --> 06:21.662
No, no, no.
I was just thinking.

06:21.730 --> 06:23.397
I wasn't saying no.

06:23.465 --> 06:25.866
Um, I should do this.

06:25.934 --> 06:27.968
You're right.
You and Adrian did this for me,

06:28.036 --> 06:29.303
so I should do this for her.

06:29.371 --> 06:31.138
It can just be
a small shower.

06:31.206 --> 06:33.941
You know, just us girls,
'cause her mom's going
out of town for a few weeks.

06:34.009 --> 06:36.710
So we could just
have lunch together
or something.

06:36.778 --> 06:38.646
Just, you know,
a small gathering

06:38.713 --> 06:41.048
so she knows
that we all support her
and care about her.

06:41.116 --> 06:43.150
I don't know how much money
I have to put into this,

06:43.218 --> 06:45.252
but, uh, I'll see
what I can afford to do.

06:45.320 --> 06:47.421
Of course. Yeah.
I haven't even talked
to my mom about it yet.

06:47.489 --> 06:49.123
And I don't have
a job, so...

06:49.191 --> 06:50.624
We can just
talk about it tomorrow.

06:50.692 --> 06:52.593
Okay.
See you at school tomorrow.

06:52.661 --> 06:54.195
Yeah.
I'll see you at school.

06:54.262 --> 06:57.264
And, you know,
it was really nice
to see you at home.

06:57.332 --> 06:58.799
I haven't been here in ages.

06:58.867 --> 07:01.302
No. Not since you came over

07:01.369 --> 07:03.337
to offer me a job
at the church nursery.

07:03.405 --> 07:05.106
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

07:05.173 --> 07:07.041
I really owe you, Grace.

07:07.109 --> 07:09.310
I don't know what I would do
without that job.

07:09.377 --> 07:11.245
It's really been a lifesaver.

07:11.313 --> 07:14.048
And John loves it there.

07:14.116 --> 07:15.816
So you know what?

07:15.884 --> 07:19.053
I'm sorry I didn't respond
a little more
enthusiastically here.

07:19.121 --> 07:21.856
I'm happy that you asked me
to help you throw Adrian
a shower.

07:21.923 --> 07:23.891
I'll do whatever I can.
Thank you.

07:23.959 --> 07:26.093
I think it's gonna be
a lot of fun.

07:31.533 --> 07:33.100
Good night.
Good night.

07:37.706 --> 07:39.373
[sighs]

07:40.442 --> 07:42.143
Great.

07:42.210 --> 07:43.944
Like I need this.

07:50.552 --> 07:51.519
[beeping]

07:51.586 --> 07:54.355
[ringing]

07:54.422 --> 07:56.357
Hi.
Yeah. Hi.

07:56.424 --> 07:58.159
I thought you were gonna call me
when you got home.

07:58.226 --> 08:00.161
I got home,
and Dad had dinner ready.

08:00.228 --> 08:02.163
So I ate,
and then I fed John,

08:02.230 --> 08:04.031
and then I gave him a bath.

08:04.099 --> 08:06.200
And now I am cleaning
the kitchen,

08:06.268 --> 08:09.069
and I've got laundry to do
and a test to study for.

08:09.137 --> 08:11.005
So I just forgot.
I'm sorry.

08:11.072 --> 08:13.040
Yeah. Well, I hate
to point this out,

08:13.108 --> 08:14.775
but if you'd moved in
last weekend,

08:14.843 --> 08:16.443
I could be helping you
with John,

08:16.511 --> 08:18.279
and dinner and laundry
and everything else.

08:18.346 --> 08:21.549
I know. I just wasn't ready
to move in last weekend.

08:21.616 --> 08:24.318
Are you gonna be ready
to move in this weekend?
I don't know.

08:24.386 --> 08:27.021
Maybe you could just
stay over this coming weekend.

08:27.088 --> 08:29.557
Ricky, I don't know.
Just Friday night.

08:29.624 --> 08:31.559
We'll see.
Are you saying "we'll see"

08:31.626 --> 08:33.561
because I said "we'll see"
to you?

08:33.628 --> 08:36.230
No. It's just,

08:36.298 --> 08:38.933
I think that if we plan
when I'm gonna stay over there,

08:39.000 --> 08:41.669
then I'm gonna get all anxious
and nervous and not
wanna stay over there.

08:41.736 --> 08:43.337
I make you that nervous?

08:43.405 --> 08:46.440
Well, the thought
of having sex with you
makes me that nervous.

08:46.508 --> 08:49.410
Nervous in a good way.
Not a good way for me.

08:49.477 --> 08:51.111
You came over here
a few weeks ago

08:51.179 --> 08:53.047
and practically ordered me
to have sex with you.

08:53.114 --> 08:55.883
[chuckles]
I was feeling pretty confident,
wasn't I?

08:55.951 --> 08:58.319
Yeah. Well, I hope
you're gonna feel

08:58.386 --> 09:00.154
that confident again
sometime soon.

09:00.222 --> 09:01.388
Yeah. Me, too.

09:03.124 --> 09:05.859
I gotta go. I'll call you
before I go to bed, all right?

09:05.927 --> 09:07.695
Yeah. All right.
Talk to you later.

09:07.762 --> 09:10.397
Yeah. Later.
[beeps]

09:11.466 --> 09:13.000
[beeps]

09:14.669 --> 09:16.036
[knocks]

09:21.810 --> 09:23.777
I just wanna say thank you
for the shower.

09:23.845 --> 09:25.713
That is so sweet of you.

09:25.780 --> 09:28.649
It's the least I can do.
I mean, you gave me a shower,

09:28.717 --> 09:31.452
and that's when
I went into labor,
so I'll never forget it.

09:31.519 --> 09:33.120
Yeah, but that one
was kind of lame.

09:33.188 --> 09:35.556
I'm sure the shower you give me
will be much better.

09:35.624 --> 09:37.091
Much, much better.

09:37.158 --> 09:38.692
I'll try.
I'm sure you will.

09:40.061 --> 09:41.395
[sighs]

09:41.463 --> 09:43.931
So, if you're home,

09:43.999 --> 09:46.267
I guess you're not
living at Ricky's.

09:46.334 --> 09:48.736
No. I decided to wait
a little longer.

09:48.837 --> 09:50.738
You decided.
Yes. I decided.

09:50.805 --> 09:53.407
Oh. So I guess last weekend
didn't go so well?

09:53.475 --> 09:55.709
This has nothing
to do with sex.

09:55.777 --> 09:58.946
Or, actually, it does.
I decided to wait.

09:59.014 --> 10:00.848
Oh.

10:00.915 --> 10:02.850
Wait longer.

10:02.917 --> 10:06.287
Ricky's gonna
be waiting longer.

10:06.354 --> 10:08.922
Hasn't Ricky supposedly
been waiting for months?

10:08.990 --> 10:10.924
Not supposedly. He has.

10:10.992 --> 10:12.426
And he can wait a little longer.

10:12.494 --> 10:14.862
I don't know how far
I'd push this waiting game.

10:14.929 --> 10:17.231
It's Ricky.
You know what I mean?

10:17.299 --> 10:19.300
I trust him.
Yeah, I trusted him, too.

10:19.367 --> 10:21.468
My relationship with Ricky
is completely different

10:21.536 --> 10:23.137
than your relationship
with Ricky.

10:23.204 --> 10:25.139
I know.
And my relationship with Ben

10:25.206 --> 10:27.474
is completely different
than your relationship with Ben.

10:27.542 --> 10:29.410
I don't wanna go
into any details,

10:29.477 --> 10:33.947
but last weekend was crazy.

10:35.650 --> 10:38.419
I don't know how you let
that one get away.

10:38.486 --> 10:40.521
I mean, wow.

10:40.588 --> 10:42.289
[sighs]

10:42.357 --> 10:43.924
I have to go
before I say any more.

10:43.992 --> 10:46.160
I just wanted to say thank you
for the shower.

10:46.227 --> 10:48.395
No. What you really
wanted to do

10:48.463 --> 10:50.631
was let me know that
everything went well with Ben.

10:50.699 --> 10:52.333
But I'm okay with that.

10:52.400 --> 10:54.335
Oh, things didn't just go well.

10:54.402 --> 10:56.603
Things went crazy.

10:57.672 --> 11:00.307
Good night. Thanks again.

11:03.411 --> 11:05.279
He's unbelievable.

11:05.347 --> 11:07.981
Best night of my life.

11:08.049 --> 11:09.350
Even that far along?

11:09.417 --> 11:11.685
Oh, yeah. Even.

11:11.753 --> 11:14.722
And I'm sure that
when you and Ricky
finally get around to it,

11:14.789 --> 11:16.990
it will be a very...

11:17.058 --> 11:19.059
nice night in your life.

11:19.127 --> 11:20.527
Bye.

11:20.595 --> 11:22.029
Good night.

11:22.097 --> 11:24.565
[phone ringing]

11:24.632 --> 11:26.400
[sighs]

11:28.636 --> 11:30.037
[beeps]
Hello.

11:30.105 --> 11:32.439
Hey, why don't you just
come over here now?

11:32.507 --> 11:34.441
We hadn't planned
on doing anything tonight,

11:34.509 --> 11:36.443
so this way
it'll just be spontaneous.

11:36.511 --> 11:37.878
You won't have time
to get nervous.

11:37.946 --> 11:40.247
And what should I do
with our son?

11:40.315 --> 11:42.483
Should I wake him up
and bring him
over there with me,

11:42.550 --> 11:45.219
or should I leave him
in the house
and let Moose watch him?

11:45.286 --> 11:47.187
No one's here.
Okay. I'll come over there.

11:47.255 --> 11:49.390
And risk Dad and Ashley
walking in on us?

11:49.457 --> 11:50.891
No. I don't think so.

11:50.959 --> 11:52.593
Besides, I'd have to clean up,

11:52.660 --> 11:54.094
and I still haven't
done my homework.

11:54.162 --> 11:56.764
So that's your excuse now
for not having sex with me--

11:56.831 --> 11:58.332
you haven't done your homework?

11:58.400 --> 12:00.467
Hey, I don't need an excuse.

12:00.535 --> 12:02.269
I'm not making excuses.

12:02.337 --> 12:03.704
I'm just saying no,
that's all.

12:03.772 --> 12:05.539
You really wanna say no to me?

12:05.607 --> 12:07.207
[chuckles]
You know how I am.

12:07.275 --> 12:10.677
Yes. And you know what, Ricky?
I do know how you are,

12:10.745 --> 12:13.614
and I know that at this point
in our relationship,

12:13.681 --> 12:15.749
you wouldn't do anything
with anyone else but me.

12:15.817 --> 12:17.751
You might not know that yet,
but I know that.

12:17.819 --> 12:20.421
You don't know anything.
And it sounds as if

12:20.488 --> 12:22.122
you're throwing down
some kind of a challenge here.

12:22.190 --> 12:23.791
No, I'm not doing that.

12:23.858 --> 12:26.126
I'm just saying
how much I love you,
and I know you love me.

12:26.194 --> 12:28.228
Yeah? Well,
if you love me...

12:30.965 --> 12:33.400
All right.
That was kind of lame.

12:33.468 --> 12:36.103
But I don't think
we should be doing this
or not doing this.

12:36.171 --> 12:37.838
Tonight's not
the right night, Ricky.

12:37.906 --> 12:39.473
We'll know when
it's the right night.

12:39.541 --> 12:42.576
Any night is the right night,
because I do love you, Amy.

12:42.644 --> 12:45.913
And I love you, too,
but I don't want just sex.

12:45.980 --> 12:48.816
Well, maybe we could start
with just sex
and see where that goes.

12:48.883 --> 12:50.918
No. I think
we already did that.

12:50.985 --> 12:52.453
Fine. Good night.

12:52.520 --> 12:54.388
Good night.

12:54.456 --> 12:55.589
[beeps]
[chuckles]

12:55.657 --> 12:57.558
[beeps]

12:57.625 --> 12:59.426
[sighs]

13:15.221 --> 13:18.523
Wow. So,
all this would be mine if--

13:18.591 --> 13:20.325
If something
happened to me.

13:20.393 --> 13:22.761
But nothing's gonna happen to me
for a long, long time.

13:22.829 --> 13:24.763
Yeah, but when something
does happen to you...

13:24.831 --> 13:26.531
[laughs]
Wow.

13:26.599 --> 13:29.167
I'm sorry, but you seem
a little too happy

13:29.235 --> 13:30.903
about something
happening to me.

13:30.970 --> 13:33.038
No, no, no. No, that's--
that's not it.

13:33.106 --> 13:34.373
I'm just happy.

13:34.440 --> 13:37.309
Yeah. I've been
watching all week.

13:37.377 --> 13:39.645
You seem happy.
Very happy.

13:39.712 --> 13:42.214
Out-of-character happy.

13:42.282 --> 13:44.716
I know you're under
a tremendous amount
of pressure here,

13:44.784 --> 13:47.486
and I was just wondering,

13:47.553 --> 13:49.554
what's making you so happy?

13:49.622 --> 13:51.390
I mean, I hate
to ask you this, but--

13:51.457 --> 13:53.058
But, yes, we did.

13:53.126 --> 13:54.893
Adrian and I had sex.

13:54.961 --> 13:56.395
If you must know.
I mean...

13:56.462 --> 13:57.729
No, I must not know.

13:57.797 --> 13:59.765
Or I didn't wanna know, anyway.
Not about that.

13:59.832 --> 14:02.601
You were asking
why I was so happy.

14:02.669 --> 14:04.870
That's why I'm so happy.
Okay.

14:04.938 --> 14:06.571
But why did you think
I was so happy?

14:06.639 --> 14:08.907
I mean,
what were you gonna ask me
that you hated to ask me?

14:08.975 --> 14:11.576
I thought maybe you were trying
to handle all this pressure

14:11.644 --> 14:13.578
by doing drugs
or drinking or something.

14:13.646 --> 14:15.447
Oh, funny.
No, no, no, no.

14:15.515 --> 14:17.215
After last weekend,
you don't have to worry

14:17.283 --> 14:18.917
about my ever doing drugs

14:18.985 --> 14:21.186
or taking a drink
for the rest of my life.

14:21.254 --> 14:23.789
Whoo. Believe me.
[chuckles]

14:23.856 --> 14:26.792
I believe you.
And I don't wanna hear
anything about that, all right?

14:26.859 --> 14:28.460
Let's talk
about the prenup.

14:28.528 --> 14:30.996
As far as I'm concerned,
Adrian and our daughter

14:31.064 --> 14:32.431
are welcome
to everything I have.

14:32.498 --> 14:34.266
Did you read this carefully?

14:34.334 --> 14:36.601
You don't have anything.
It's all mine.

14:37.870 --> 14:39.571
And if something
were to happen to you,

14:39.639 --> 14:41.807
then whatever you would get
would go to Adrian and the baby.

14:41.874 --> 14:43.942
Now, what the prenup says

14:44.010 --> 14:47.112
is that that would only happen
after a number of years,

14:47.180 --> 14:49.114
and the percentage
that Adrian would get

14:49.182 --> 14:50.615
goes up with
each year of marriage.

14:50.683 --> 14:52.951
Now, your daughter
can't really get anything

14:53.019 --> 14:55.821
until she's 30
because that money's in a trust.

14:55.888 --> 14:58.924
And then she'll get
a small amount each year.

14:58.992 --> 15:01.159
Ruben will go over
all of this with Adrian.

15:01.227 --> 15:02.294
All right.

15:02.362 --> 15:04.796
Do not take this lightly.

15:04.864 --> 15:07.132
Make sure
you understand this.

15:07.200 --> 15:10.335
All I really understand
is that I'm going to be

15:10.403 --> 15:12.804
a very happy man
for the rest of my life.

15:12.872 --> 15:13.972
Maybe.

15:14.040 --> 15:15.107
No, definitely.

15:15.174 --> 15:17.042
There's an old saying, okay?

15:17.110 --> 15:19.111
And it goes
something like this:

15:19.178 --> 15:21.113
During your first year
of marriage,

15:21.180 --> 15:24.316
You put a penny in a bucket
every time you have sex.

15:24.384 --> 15:26.184
Then, starting your
second year of marriage,

15:26.252 --> 15:28.487
usually about the time
when the baby comes along,

15:28.554 --> 15:32.324
you take a penny out
every time you have sex.

15:32.392 --> 15:35.660
And you won't drain that bucket
if you're married for 50 years.

15:35.728 --> 15:38.196
We'll see about that.

15:38.264 --> 15:40.298
The woman
is having your baby.

15:40.366 --> 15:42.667
Things are gonna change
after the baby gets here.

15:42.735 --> 15:44.703
Yeah, it would seem
only for the better.

15:44.771 --> 15:47.139
Although I don't know how
things could get any better.
Whoo.

15:47.206 --> 15:48.774
We are done here.

15:51.477 --> 15:53.912
All right.
Nice talking to you, Dad.

15:53.980 --> 15:56.281
I'm just gonna go look
for a big, big bucket.

15:56.349 --> 15:57.783
[golf ball thuds]

16:06.159 --> 16:08.226
[Jack]
What are you doing here?

16:08.294 --> 16:10.195
What are you doing here?
I asked you first.

16:10.263 --> 16:12.764
I don't know
what you two are doing here,

16:12.832 --> 16:14.900
but I know
what I'm doing here.

16:14.967 --> 16:16.535
Not having sex.

16:16.602 --> 16:17.536
[chuckles]

16:17.603 --> 16:20.972
I've been taking
the damn bus

16:21.040 --> 16:22.874
for a week.

16:22.942 --> 16:26.078
I never meet anyone.
Anyone!

16:27.980 --> 16:30.649
So, uh, I thought you and Amy
were moving in together.

16:30.716 --> 16:32.584
What happened?
I thought you and Madison

16:32.652 --> 16:34.920
were gonna stop doing
what you're doing
and do the real thing.

16:34.987 --> 16:36.688
What happened?
Her stepmother asked me

16:36.756 --> 16:39.758
to step back
and stop putting pressure
on Madison right now,

16:39.826 --> 16:41.326
so we stopped
having sex altogether.

16:41.394 --> 16:43.328
I didn't really wanna know.

16:43.396 --> 16:46.231
I just asked you
because you asked me.

16:46.299 --> 16:47.966
How long have you two
been seeing each other?

16:49.735 --> 16:52.104
Do you really wanna know that?
Yeah, I really wanna know that.

16:52.171 --> 16:54.473
And I really wanna know
how you don't really have sex

16:54.540 --> 16:56.741
after however long
you've been together.

16:56.809 --> 16:58.276
Because I know
it's a long time.

16:59.712 --> 17:02.214
He plays football

17:02.281 --> 17:05.483
and basketball and volleyball,

17:05.550 --> 17:07.551
and he goes bowling.

17:07.619 --> 17:09.554
I play sports
because I like to play sports.

17:09.622 --> 17:11.690
Yeah, I play drums
because I like drums.

17:11.757 --> 17:13.692
But I like sex better.

17:13.759 --> 17:15.861
Right now,
I'm not having sex.
Join the club.

17:15.928 --> 17:17.695
That's not a club
I care to join.

17:17.762 --> 17:19.865
You know, uh,
Grace asked me
if I'd ask my dad

17:19.932 --> 17:21.800
if he'd marry Adrian and Ben.

17:21.867 --> 17:23.502
Apparently
they had sex last weekend,

17:23.569 --> 17:25.637
and the two of them
thought they saw God
or something.

17:27.073 --> 17:29.674
Why not me, God?
Why not me?

17:29.742 --> 17:32.377
Do I really need to know
that Adrian and Ben
are having sex?

17:32.445 --> 17:34.379
Apparently everyone knows.

17:34.447 --> 17:37.382
Just like everyone knows
you and Amy probably
aren't having sex.

17:37.450 --> 17:40.051
Of course, not me,
because I never know anything.

17:40.119 --> 17:41.520
[sighs]

17:58.240 --> 17:59.274
[door opens]

17:59.342 --> 18:01.409
Good morning.
I'm just grabbing some milk.

18:01.477 --> 18:03.545
We're out of milk
out there.

18:03.612 --> 18:06.815
All you have to do
is write "milk" on the list,
and Mom will get it for you.

18:06.882 --> 18:08.616
It's not that difficult.

18:08.684 --> 18:10.518
Looks like someone's
not in a good mood
this morning.

18:10.586 --> 18:12.020
No, I am.

18:12.088 --> 18:14.622
No, you're not.
Have a fight with Grant,
is that it?

18:14.690 --> 18:17.859
No, I did not have
a fight with Grant,
and I'm not in a bad mood.

18:17.927 --> 18:20.428
Why, did you hear something?
No. Was there something
to hear?

18:20.496 --> 18:22.364
No.
All right.

18:22.431 --> 18:24.332
Well, I talked
to my dad.
Oh?

18:24.400 --> 18:26.334
And I didn't ask him.
[sighs]

18:26.402 --> 18:28.536
I thought about it,
but I didn't.

18:28.604 --> 18:30.638
I really don't have any reason
to do you any favors.

18:33.642 --> 18:36.378
I believe you're sleeping
in our guest house,
aren't you?

18:36.445 --> 18:39.147
Yeah, but that was a favor
from your mother, not you.

18:39.215 --> 18:42.517
Are you saying
you want a favor from me?

18:42.585 --> 18:44.519
I hope you don't mean
some sort of sexual favor.

18:44.587 --> 18:45.954
I didn't say
I wanted a favor.

18:46.021 --> 18:47.822
I don't want a favor from you,
sexual or otherwise.

18:47.890 --> 18:50.425
Well, you already got
a sexual favor from me,
if I recall.

18:50.493 --> 18:52.594
That wasn't a favor.
You waed to do that

18:52.661 --> 18:54.629
just as much as I did,
and you thought it was great.

18:54.697 --> 18:55.964
Yeah.

18:56.031 --> 18:58.166
It was so good you thought
you'd killed your own father.

18:58.234 --> 19:00.502
[scoffs]
I know. How stupid was that?

19:00.569 --> 19:02.103
It wasn't stupid.

19:02.171 --> 19:04.105
I mean,
we were good together.

19:04.173 --> 19:06.107
It was a good night
for the two of us.

19:06.175 --> 19:08.977
My father died that night.
That was not a good night
for me.

19:09.044 --> 19:11.312
Before you found out
your father died,
it was a good night for you.

19:11.380 --> 19:13.314
I guess.
You guess?

19:13.382 --> 19:14.849
I don't even really
remember it that much.

19:14.917 --> 19:15.984
It was your first time.

19:16.051 --> 19:18.086
Yeah, maybe I'm blocking
it out or something.

19:19.355 --> 19:21.055
I wish we'd waited.

19:21.123 --> 19:23.258
I wish my first time
had been with Grant.

19:23.325 --> 19:26.027
And I'm lucky that
doesn't keep him from
wanting to be my boyfriend.

19:26.095 --> 19:28.329
Yeah, well, I doubt
you're the first girl
he's been with.

19:28.397 --> 19:30.799
And he's lucky
that didn't stop you from
wanting to be his girlfriend.

19:30.866 --> 19:32.734
Well, thank you.
Don't thank me.

19:32.802 --> 19:36.004
Somehow a remark
just accidentally
turned into a compliment.

19:36.071 --> 19:37.705
You annoy me.
You and Grant.

19:37.773 --> 19:40.141
[chuckles]
Why, because we're having sex,
and you're not?

19:40.209 --> 19:41.709
I could if I wanted to.

19:41.777 --> 19:43.845
Maybe I've grown up
a little this year.

19:43.913 --> 19:45.580
Maybe I don't have to have sex.

19:45.648 --> 19:48.483
Maybe I'm okay
with being in a relationship
without having sex.

19:48.551 --> 19:50.718
Or maybe you and Madison
don't really love each other.

19:50.786 --> 19:53.855
Maybe that's why you're okay
not having sex.

19:53.923 --> 19:56.458
Just so you know,
I already called your dad,
and he said he'd do it.

19:56.525 --> 19:59.561
He'll marry Adrian and Ben.
Isn't it funny
how you have my dad's number,

19:59.628 --> 20:01.229
and you know him well enough
to call him,

20:01.297 --> 20:02.664
and yet you haven't
even met Grant's father?

20:04.033 --> 20:06.734
And you're having sex
with Grant.

20:06.802 --> 20:09.637
And I did hear,
and I know what
the fight was about.

20:27.223 --> 20:29.190
Hi.
Hi.

20:29.258 --> 20:31.326
So I'm going to pick up
my wedding dress
this afternoon.

20:31.393 --> 20:32.994
Do you wanna see it?
Oh, thanks,

20:33.062 --> 20:34.729
but I have to work
this afternoon.

20:34.797 --> 20:37.365
But if you want,
you can come over, and we could
talk about your shower tonight.

20:37.433 --> 20:39.567
On a Friday night?

20:39.635 --> 20:41.236
No, not tonight.

20:41.303 --> 20:43.705
I have other things
to do tonight,
if you know what I mean.

20:45.474 --> 20:47.375
Ooh. I'll talk to you later.

20:48.477 --> 20:49.944
Hi.
Hey, there.

20:50.012 --> 20:51.713
Hey, so what time
do you wanna go out tonight?

20:51.780 --> 20:53.214
How's 3:30?
[laughs]

20:53.282 --> 20:55.850
No. I have to go to work.
I don't get off until 5:00.

20:55.918 --> 20:57.352
Well, then,
I'll see you at 5:15.

20:57.419 --> 20:59.521
Well, I gotta go home
and take a shower.

20:59.622 --> 21:02.757
Well, how about I meet you
in the shower at the condo?

21:02.825 --> 21:05.093
I like that idea.
What kind of soap do you like?

21:05.160 --> 21:08.062
I'll bring the soap
and the shampoo.
You just bring you.

21:09.932 --> 21:11.766
Hi, guys.
Hi.

21:11.834 --> 21:13.568
Hi.
Hi.

21:13.636 --> 21:16.304
We wanted to see if you guys
wanted to catch a movie
or something tonight

21:16.372 --> 21:18.306
since we didn't get
to go out with you last weekend

21:18.374 --> 21:19.641
and haven't talked to you
all week.

21:19.708 --> 21:21.409
[together]
Not tonight.
Tomorrow night?

21:21.477 --> 21:23.378
No.
I'm trying to make
an effort here

21:23.445 --> 21:26.114
since Ben said
he wants us to be included
in your new life together.

21:26.181 --> 21:28.783
Well, it's gotten newer,
and I've changed my mind.

21:28.851 --> 21:31.319
You two were right.
You can't be included
in everything.

21:31.387 --> 21:33.821
Oh, but I do want you
to come to my shower, Alice.

21:33.889 --> 21:35.557
Grace and Amy
are throwing me a shower.

21:35.624 --> 21:38.359
Sure. I'd love to come.
And that's really nice
of Grace and Amy.

21:38.427 --> 21:41.596
Yeah, well, I guess everyone
is just happy for us
and the baby.

21:41.664 --> 21:43.364
Have a nice weekend.

21:46.435 --> 21:50.738
"Nice weekend"? Weekend?
We're not gonna see him
all weekend?

21:50.806 --> 21:53.241
What happened?
What happened between
last weekend and this weekend?

21:53.309 --> 21:54.576
I bet I know what happened.

21:54.643 --> 21:56.177
I bet you don't.
She's having a baby.

21:57.646 --> 21:59.080
They did not have sex.

21:59.148 --> 22:01.516
I think they did.
Well, they didn't!

22:01.584 --> 22:03.618
And now I have to go
to a stupid shower for her!

22:03.686 --> 22:05.920
Yeah, well, she's our
best friend's soon-to-be wife.

22:05.988 --> 22:07.755
You're probably gonna have to do
a lot of stuff with her.

22:07.823 --> 22:09.257
No, I'm not.

22:09.325 --> 22:10.725
Embrace it.

22:18.400 --> 22:20.969
I was wrong,
and you were right.

22:21.036 --> 22:22.904
I should've introduced you
to my parents by now.

22:29.345 --> 22:31.980
Yes, you should have,
but thank you.

22:32.047 --> 22:34.616
This is so sweet.
[sniffs]

22:34.683 --> 22:36.618
I got it from our garden,
so it actually smells.

22:36.685 --> 22:38.786
And my dad suggested it.

22:38.854 --> 22:41.055
And it's my fault
if you're closer to Jack's dad,

22:41.123 --> 22:43.992
and you have his phone number,
and you talk to him
and not my dad,

22:44.059 --> 22:45.493
because you don't
even know my dad.

22:45.561 --> 22:46.794
And?

22:46.862 --> 22:48.663
And I love you.

22:48.731 --> 22:50.798
I love you, too.

22:52.401 --> 22:55.303
And you're gonna introduce me
to your parents when?

22:55.371 --> 22:57.939
Tonight. But we'll
have to make it early.

22:58.007 --> 22:59.107
Okay. How early?

22:59.174 --> 23:01.743
I don't know. 5:30?
Okay.

23:13.155 --> 23:14.422
Thank you.

23:14.490 --> 23:16.357
Hey. I got that.

23:16.425 --> 23:17.692
Here.
Thanks.

23:17.760 --> 23:19.460
You know where this goes.

23:19.528 --> 23:21.896
[chuckles]
Thank you.

23:24.166 --> 23:26.100
I missed you
last night.

23:27.202 --> 23:29.504
Oh, I missed you, too.

23:44.119 --> 23:46.821
If you're doing this
so that people will think
that we're having sex,

23:46.889 --> 23:48.589
I don't really care.

23:48.657 --> 23:51.125
I like kissing you.
A lot.

23:54.263 --> 23:56.998
Why don't you
bring John back over tonight,
and you stay over, too?

23:57.066 --> 23:58.499
No. That's okay.

23:58.567 --> 24:00.702
I thought we wanted to see
what it's like to be a family.

24:00.769 --> 24:02.537
We do want that.
I want that.

24:02.604 --> 24:04.539
I want that too, and...

24:04.606 --> 24:06.674
[whispering]
I wanna sleep with you, Amy.

24:06.742 --> 24:07.742
I know.

24:07.810 --> 24:09.510
You know? And?

24:09.578 --> 24:10.878
And when it's right.

24:10.946 --> 24:13.581
Okay. Well, suppose
we have an agreement

24:13.649 --> 24:15.983
that until it's right,
that I can do whatever I want?

24:16.051 --> 24:17.985
You can do whatever you want.

24:18.053 --> 24:19.320
Look, Ricky,

24:19.388 --> 24:21.589
I promise that
for the rest of our lives,

24:21.657 --> 24:23.424
you can do whatever you want.

24:23.492 --> 24:25.993
You just can't do whatever
you want when you want with me.

24:26.061 --> 24:27.662
And that's just the way
it's going to be,

24:27.730 --> 24:29.397
because the only way
I'd be comfortable

24:29.465 --> 24:32.133
is if I feel like
I have complete control
over when we have sex.

24:32.201 --> 24:34.102
I don't think I'm ever
just gonna do it with you

24:34.169 --> 24:35.770
because you wanna do it.

24:35.838 --> 24:37.772
Not even if we're
living together or--

24:37.840 --> 24:40.041
or even if we're married.

24:40.109 --> 24:42.376
I want our relationship
to be more than sex.

24:50.385 --> 24:52.487
I thought it was.

24:57.032 --> 24:59.767
It's only 5:30.
Why are you going out
at 5:30?

24:59.835 --> 25:02.136
Because that's what time
Grant said his dad
likes to go out.

25:02.204 --> 25:05.240
At 5:30?
Yeah. And Grant's parents
really want to meet you,

25:05.307 --> 25:07.675
so they're gonna come over
here first, and then Grant
and I are gonna go out.

25:07.743 --> 25:09.811
And leave them here with me?
No, I don't think so.

25:09.879 --> 25:11.980
Well, I hope not.
Honey, I just got home,

25:12.047 --> 25:15.550
and I haven't cooked anything,
we don't have any food
in the house, and...

25:15.618 --> 25:18.319
Well, it's not even dinnertime,
and I have been
running around all day

25:18.387 --> 25:20.655
getting ideas for that shower
you're gonna throw next week.

25:20.723 --> 25:24.959
Well, I told you I would do it.
Yeah, but you did it last time,
and it was totally lame.

25:25.027 --> 25:27.595
Well, I really appreciate
everything you're doing,

25:27.663 --> 25:30.031
especially since
we're not inviting mothers.

25:30.099 --> 25:31.466
Thank you.
You're welcome.

25:31.534 --> 25:33.668
Maybe you should
just get in there

25:33.736 --> 25:35.470
and whip up something
for Grant's parents to eat.

25:35.538 --> 25:36.804
Maybe, like, appetizers
or something.

25:36.872 --> 25:38.840
I don't wanna get in there
and whip something up.

25:38.908 --> 25:41.543
Why don't you whip something up?
Because all I know
how to make are cookies,

25:41.610 --> 25:43.311
and this feels
too grown-up for cookies.

25:43.379 --> 25:45.513
[doorbell rings]

25:45.581 --> 25:47.482
Maybe we could just offer them
a cocktail or something?

25:47.550 --> 25:49.651
A cocktail?

25:49.718 --> 25:51.853
Honey,
I don't make cocktails.

25:51.921 --> 25:55.690
I have a bottle of wine,
but it's been open for weeks.

25:55.758 --> 25:57.892
Hi. You must be Grace.

25:57.960 --> 25:59.260
I'm Carrie Costigan.

25:59.328 --> 26:00.895
Who?

26:00.963 --> 26:02.297
I would assume Grant's mom.

26:02.364 --> 26:04.632
Grant's last name
isn't Costigan.

26:04.700 --> 26:06.801
I kept my maiden name.
Oh.

26:06.869 --> 26:09.971
Well, hi.
I'm Kathleen, Grace's mom.
Come on in.

26:10.039 --> 26:12.574
So nice to meet you finally.
And you, Grace.

26:12.641 --> 26:14.309
Look at you.
You're gorgeous.

26:15.544 --> 26:17.478
Grant said you were gorgeous.

26:17.546 --> 26:19.314
And he said the same thing
about you.

26:19.381 --> 26:21.516
No, actually, he said
Grace's mom was hot.

26:21.584 --> 26:22.584
Oh.
[laughs]

26:22.651 --> 26:24.352
Oh, that's so nice of him.

26:24.420 --> 26:27.355
I really like Grant.
Even before he said that.

26:27.423 --> 26:30.358
Um, are you by yourself?

26:30.426 --> 26:32.293
Well...
[Grant]
We're coming.

26:32.361 --> 26:33.962
We're coming.

26:38.434 --> 26:40.368
Hi, Grace, Kathleen.

26:40.436 --> 26:42.403
You met my mother Carrie?
We met.

26:42.471 --> 26:45.106
And this is Grant's father,
my husband of 20 years.

26:45.174 --> 26:46.608
This is Vic Foeburg.

26:46.675 --> 26:48.643
Vic Foeburg,
the Voice of Sports.

26:50.079 --> 26:51.346
Nice to meet you, ladies.

26:57.119 --> 26:58.987
Wanna ask me to come in
and sit down,

26:59.054 --> 27:01.556
or should I just
end my days here at the door?

27:01.624 --> 27:03.791
Oh! Oh, goodness. Yes.

27:03.859 --> 27:06.160
Come on in.
Please come in.

27:06.228 --> 27:09.964
Oh, one of those
May-December romances.

27:10.032 --> 27:12.734
[Vic]
May 1969, December 1930.

27:12.801 --> 27:15.703
That's our favorite joke.
[chuckles]

27:15.771 --> 27:19.841
See, I was born in '69,
and the B-man was born in '30.

27:19.908 --> 27:22.243
You got yourself a boyfriend
with some good genes, Grace.

27:22.311 --> 27:23.478
[chuckles]

27:28.317 --> 27:30.585
[both mouthing words]

27:33.589 --> 27:35.757
Your plate's in the microwave.
Why are you late again?

27:35.824 --> 27:37.792
I told you I was gonna

27:37.860 --> 27:39.927
take John out to dinner,
just the two of us.

27:39.995 --> 27:41.396
Oh, Ricky's busy tonight?

27:41.463 --> 27:43.464
If he is,
you just let him be busy.

27:43.532 --> 27:45.867
That was
a good decision you made--
waiting to move in with him.

27:45.934 --> 27:47.602
I don't know
what Ricky's doing tonight.

27:47.670 --> 27:49.237
I just wanted
to go out with John.

27:49.304 --> 27:51.639
Too many dishes for you
last night?
There was a lot of dishes,

27:51.707 --> 27:54.876
but I really enjoyed
the dinner, Dad,
so I was fine cleaning up.

27:54.943 --> 27:56.678
It's just that last night
was a school night,

27:56.745 --> 28:00.081
and I cleaned,
I had to entertain
Grace and Adrian,

28:00.149 --> 28:02.216
I fed John
and gave him a bath

28:02.284 --> 28:05.319
and got him to bed
and still had homework to do.

28:05.387 --> 28:07.588
I don't know,
I just feel as if every night,

28:07.656 --> 28:09.724
I'm rushing through
what I need to do for John

28:09.792 --> 28:12.293
to get to what
I need to do for me.

28:12.361 --> 28:14.729
So tonight we went out,
and we took our time eating,

28:14.797 --> 28:17.031
and we played
those little arcade games

28:17.099 --> 28:18.599
and drove the little cars,

28:18.667 --> 28:20.902
and, uh, we bopped
the things on the head.

28:20.969 --> 28:23.104
It was fun.
So having a baby is now fun?

28:23.172 --> 28:25.106
It should be fun for him
to be baby,

28:25.174 --> 28:27.308
just like it
should be fun for me to be
a teenager some of the time.

28:27.376 --> 28:30.278
And it should be fun for me
to be a teenager
some of the time,

28:30.345 --> 28:32.380
but Toby's car's in the shop,

28:32.448 --> 28:35.216
so Dad volunteered to drive us.

28:35.284 --> 28:38.286
You wouldn't wanna
loan Toby your car, would you?

28:38.353 --> 28:39.454
No.

28:40.723 --> 28:42.757
You're going out
with Toby tonight?

28:42.825 --> 28:44.492
I am going out
with Toby tonight.

28:44.560 --> 28:46.594
She's going out
with Toby tonight,
and I'm going with them.

28:46.662 --> 28:49.263
No, you're not.
You're just dropping us off.

28:50.699 --> 28:52.233
I thought that we'd all
just hang out.

28:53.836 --> 28:56.204
Last week,
you were yelling at me
for never being around,

28:56.271 --> 28:58.673
for not being here
so we can get through this
together tonight.

28:58.741 --> 29:01.309
Yeah, but now
I really am over it.

29:02.644 --> 29:04.512
[sighs]
Fine.

29:04.580 --> 29:06.814
You drop her off,
and then we can hang out.

29:06.882 --> 29:09.650
You know,
after I get John to bed.
Where are you going?

29:09.718 --> 29:11.619
Out.
Out where?
You have a date?

29:11.687 --> 29:13.888
No, but if I don't get out,
I'll never get a date,
so I'm getting out.

29:13.956 --> 29:16.157
While they're at the movie,
I'm going to a sports bar.
You're going to drink?

29:16.225 --> 29:17.592
No, I'm not gonna drink.
I'm driving.

29:17.659 --> 29:19.460
I'm looking for women who drink
and like sports.

29:19.528 --> 29:21.462
Fine. Well, then,
I will look forward

29:21.530 --> 29:22.997
to having the house
to myself for once.

29:23.065 --> 29:24.932
To do what?
I don't know.

29:25.000 --> 29:28.035
Maybe I'll start
with a long, hot bath,

29:28.103 --> 29:30.338
and then I'll start
working on that stupid shower.

29:30.405 --> 29:32.039
I'm trying to figure out
what we can do for Adrian.

29:32.107 --> 29:34.041
You're really gonna
give Adrian a shower?
Yeah.

29:34.109 --> 29:35.376
I'm really doing that,

29:35.444 --> 29:37.712
and I'm going to need money
to do that.

29:37.780 --> 29:40.014
How much money?
I don't know.
Whatever you wanna give me.

29:40.082 --> 29:41.649
200 bucks?
What?

29:41.717 --> 29:43.217
Well, it can't cost more
than 200 bucks, can it?

29:43.285 --> 29:44.552
Dad, you are always yelling

29:44.620 --> 29:46.254
at Ashley and me
to stick to our budgets,

29:46.321 --> 29:48.990
and you'd give me $200
to throw Adrian a shower?

29:49.057 --> 29:50.958
You didn't even give me
200 bucks when I was pregnant.

29:51.026 --> 29:52.460
Would you quit competing
with that girl?

29:52.528 --> 29:54.896
Come here, little man.
Come here, handsome.

29:54.963 --> 29:57.265
Yeah! Oh, boy!

29:57.332 --> 29:59.267
[phone ringing]

30:01.537 --> 30:03.137
[beeps]
Hello.

30:03.205 --> 30:05.139
Okay. Last chance.

30:05.207 --> 30:07.041
You wanna come over tonight,
or don't you?

30:07.109 --> 30:09.677
No, I don't. Not tonight,
but thanks for asking.

30:09.745 --> 30:11.612
Is this how it's gonna be
when we're married--

30:11.680 --> 30:13.514
"No, not tonight,
but thanks for asking"?

30:13.582 --> 30:15.483
I don't know. But I'm sure
there will be some nights

30:15.551 --> 30:16.818
when I wanna do it
and you don't.

30:16.885 --> 30:19.487
No, there won't.
It doesn't work like that.

30:19.555 --> 30:21.155
Fine. Well,

30:21.223 --> 30:23.357
it's nice to know
that you'll always
wanna have sex with me.

30:23.425 --> 30:25.526
Even if you don't always
wanna have sex with me?

30:25.594 --> 30:26.527
Yes.

30:26.595 --> 30:28.663
[beeps]
[sighs]

30:32.367 --> 30:34.302
I'm starving.

30:34.369 --> 30:36.437
I ordered in.

30:36.505 --> 30:38.439
Oh, you're the best.

30:38.507 --> 30:40.374
I'm in heaven here.

30:40.442 --> 30:42.310
Yeah. Me, too.

30:42.377 --> 30:44.712
But, you know,
we're not supposed to be here

30:44.780 --> 30:46.514
until after we're married.

30:46.582 --> 30:48.182
I know, I know.

30:48.250 --> 30:50.918
But we're not
gonna spend the night.

30:50.986 --> 30:53.321
I can't wait to spend
the night with you.

30:53.388 --> 30:54.655
[chuckles]

30:54.723 --> 30:57.024
I can't wait
to start our lives together--

30:57.092 --> 30:58.593
me and you and the baby.

30:58.660 --> 31:02.196
Well, I think we're off
to a really hot start.

31:02.264 --> 31:04.365
Yeah.
Hmm?

31:10.005 --> 31:11.205
[knocking]

31:11.273 --> 31:14.375
Yeah, yeah!
I'm coming, I'm coming!

31:14.443 --> 31:16.010
[sighs]

31:19.081 --> 31:20.548
Hey, Toby.
Good to see you.

31:20.616 --> 31:21.883
This your mother?

31:23.485 --> 31:25.586
No wonder you don't wanna
leave home to go to school.

31:25.654 --> 31:27.588
Ashley said
this would be hell.

31:27.656 --> 31:29.824
This is going to be hell.

31:29.892 --> 31:31.759
Why do you two
have to go out tonight?

31:31.827 --> 31:34.929
Well, because
the movie's only showing
at the Art House tonight,

31:34.997 --> 31:37.932
and it's not gonna be on TV,
and Ashley really wants
to see it.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.800
Yeah, all right.
Let Ashley know
you're here, will you?

31:39.868 --> 31:41.535
Gladly.

31:43.739 --> 31:47.241
I can drive them.
I'm Carly, Toby's stepsister.

31:47.309 --> 31:49.911
I see. I'm George,
Ashley's stepbrother.

31:49.978 --> 31:51.078
[chuckles]

31:51.146 --> 31:52.980
How old are you?
You in high school?

31:53.048 --> 31:54.682
No, I am not in high school.

31:54.750 --> 31:56.183
I'm not even in college.

31:56.251 --> 31:58.819
But I teach at
the local community college.

31:58.887 --> 32:01.589
Criminy. I'm gonna have to
sign up for some courses.

32:01.657 --> 32:03.090
Are you interested
in geography?

32:03.158 --> 32:04.892
I might be.

32:06.528 --> 32:08.562
Really, I can drive
Toby and Ashley.

32:08.630 --> 32:10.431
I was gonna go
to the sports bar

32:10.499 --> 32:12.333
across the street
and just wait for them.

32:12.401 --> 32:13.968
No kidding?
That's what I was gonna do.

32:14.036 --> 32:15.469
Then the two of us
should drive them,

32:15.537 --> 32:17.138
and we can hang out together.

32:17.205 --> 32:19.640
Better than not
drinking alone, right?

32:19.708 --> 32:22.276
Right.

32:22.344 --> 32:23.945
[knocking]

32:24.012 --> 32:27.648
Oh, it's my other
daughter's boyfriend.

32:27.716 --> 32:29.583
I thought you weren't
coming over tonight.

32:29.651 --> 32:31.519
I changed my mind.

32:31.586 --> 32:35.089
I'll just let Amy know I'm here.
No, I'll let Amy
know you're here,

32:35.157 --> 32:37.158
and I'll let you know if she
feels like seeing you tonight.

32:37.225 --> 32:39.126
Excuse me, Carly.
I'll be right back.

32:39.194 --> 32:41.462
What are you doing here?

32:41.530 --> 32:43.965
My stepbrother's
Ashley's study buddy.

32:44.032 --> 32:46.500
What are you doing here?
Ashley is Amy's sister.

32:46.568 --> 32:48.002
As in the mother
of your son?

32:48.070 --> 32:51.072
Yeah. Are you going out
with George?

32:51.139 --> 32:53.307
[chuckling]
He's, like, an old man.

32:53.375 --> 32:56.277
I thought
you didn't have anything
about age differences.

32:56.345 --> 32:58.279
And don't forget,
I'm ten years older
than you are.

32:58.347 --> 33:00.448
He's way more than ten years
older than you are.

33:00.515 --> 33:03.484
I am not having sex with him.
We just met.

33:03.552 --> 33:05.486
We're driving the kids
to the movies.

33:06.755 --> 33:09.457
Do you wanna
hook up later?

33:09.524 --> 33:11.993
What time
you gonna be home?

33:12.060 --> 33:13.928
She said
to give her ten minutes.

33:13.996 --> 33:15.496
She'd like
to speak with you.

33:28.257 --> 33:30.024
It's just...

33:30.058 --> 33:32.693
you led me to believe
you wanted to have sex with me,

33:32.728 --> 33:36.097
you wanted to live with me,
so I have expectations.

33:36.131 --> 33:37.698
Aw.

33:37.733 --> 33:41.002
You must be
really disappointed.

33:41.036 --> 33:42.703
Although,
[clears throat]

33:42.738 --> 33:44.772
I must say that

33:44.806 --> 33:47.041
I think you were
a little nervous
about my moving in.

33:47.075 --> 33:48.543
No, I wasn't.

33:48.577 --> 33:50.678
And once I got
my mind around it,
it all made sense.

33:50.712 --> 33:53.648
It still makes sense.
It does.
It does make sense.

33:53.682 --> 33:55.917
So, since we agreed
that it makes total sense--

33:55.951 --> 33:57.785
Then when we do
move in together,

33:57.819 --> 33:59.420
we'll both be ready,
and it'll be great.

33:59.454 --> 34:03.157
Don't build
my expectations even more
with, "It'll be great."

34:03.192 --> 34:05.126
Maybe it won't be so great.
Maybe you'll just

34:05.160 --> 34:07.061
be saying no all the time
once you move in.

34:07.095 --> 34:08.596
I won't be saying no
all the time.

34:08.630 --> 34:09.931
I might say no sometimes.

34:09.965 --> 34:11.632
And by "sometimes,"
you mean how many times?

34:11.667 --> 34:14.402
I don't know.
Look, Ricky, I told you.

34:14.436 --> 34:16.370
I wanna be able to say no
and for you to hear that.

34:16.405 --> 34:18.773
Yeah, you told me that
over and over and over again.

34:18.806 --> 34:20.474
And you don't seem
to be hearing me.

34:20.509 --> 34:23.177
Oh, I hear you.
I hear you all right.
Good night.

34:23.212 --> 34:25.179
Come on.
Don't leave angry.

34:25.214 --> 34:28.416
I'm not angry,
but I am leaving.

34:34.156 --> 34:36.257
[sighs]
[door closes]

34:40.728 --> 34:42.630
[Moose whines]

34:44.032 --> 34:45.132
Moose.

34:46.601 --> 34:49.704
It's not like Ricky
is an animal.

34:49.737 --> 34:53.107
I mean, he can control
the need to have sex
if he wants.

34:53.141 --> 34:55.443
Am I right, Moose?
Hmm? Am I?

34:56.511 --> 34:58.012
Exactly.

34:58.046 --> 34:59.947
[knocking]

35:05.787 --> 35:08.122
Hey, I just saw Ricky leave.
What's going on?

35:08.156 --> 35:10.524
Nothing's going on.
Oh. That's what I figured.

35:10.559 --> 35:12.793
Well, I guess,
since you're home,

35:12.828 --> 35:14.762
and it's 8:00 at night,
and you're in your robe,

35:14.796 --> 35:16.797
nothing's going on
between you and Ben either.

35:16.832 --> 35:18.532
Oh, it's already gone on,

35:18.567 --> 35:22.370
and I'm just home
because I am exhausted.

35:22.404 --> 35:25.206
But since it is early,
I thought I'd see how plans
for the shower are going.

35:25.240 --> 35:28.009
Grace said her mom
was going to come up
with some ideas,

35:28.043 --> 35:30.511
try to get some prices
from some restaurants,

35:30.545 --> 35:33.314
you know, so maybe we can
have it at a restaurant.

35:33.348 --> 35:35.950
You know, so it won't be as lame
as the one you and Grace
threw me.

35:35.984 --> 35:37.785
Great.
Yeah.

35:37.819 --> 35:39.553
So, we'll let you
know something soon.

35:39.588 --> 35:41.656
All right.

35:41.690 --> 35:43.524
Well...
[sighs]

35:44.393 --> 35:47.061
[sighs]
Look,

35:47.095 --> 35:49.497
I can't just go home without
talking to you woman-to-woman.

35:49.531 --> 35:52.133
About the shower?
No, Amy.

35:52.167 --> 35:54.802
About Ben, about Ricky.

35:54.836 --> 35:58.639
Look, sooner or later,
you two are going to do it.

35:58.674 --> 36:02.009
You know you are.
So go ahead. Get in there.

36:02.044 --> 36:04.412
Look, if it's not good
the first time--

36:04.446 --> 36:06.447
I mean, the second time--

36:06.481 --> 36:09.350
then it will get better,
eventually.

36:10.552 --> 36:13.087
So just get in there.
You know, move in.

36:13.121 --> 36:16.691
Because if you wait,
then, well,

36:16.725 --> 36:20.127
I think you're gonna
have to be prepared
to lose him.

36:20.162 --> 36:22.530
I wasn't prepared
to lose Ricky.

36:22.564 --> 36:25.132
And believe me,
it was painful.

36:25.167 --> 36:26.734
And I just--

36:26.768 --> 36:28.969
I just wanna spare you
the pain.

36:30.005 --> 36:32.340
Your serial logic is flawed.

36:33.575 --> 36:36.210
You lost him, and you were
having sex with him.

36:36.244 --> 36:37.712
Yeah.

36:37.746 --> 36:41.115
Well, as it turns out,
I have something better now.

36:41.149 --> 36:43.718
So I know that Ben was...

36:43.752 --> 36:45.786
He was in God's plan for me.

36:45.821 --> 36:48.489
God wanted you to have Ben?

36:48.523 --> 36:51.759
Well, apparently.

36:54.629 --> 36:56.497
[scoffs]

37:02.037 --> 37:04.338
Mmm. It's very...

37:04.373 --> 37:06.407
Old? Oh.

37:06.441 --> 37:08.843
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean "old."

37:08.877 --> 37:10.611
I mean, uh, flat.

37:10.645 --> 37:13.381
[chuckles]
It's okay. You can say "old."

37:13.415 --> 37:15.716
Vic knows he's old.
I know he's old.

37:15.751 --> 37:18.419
But, hey, it works for us.
Most of the time.

37:20.021 --> 37:21.689
I'm sorry.
That was a joke.

37:21.723 --> 37:23.157
I forgot you were Christian.

37:23.191 --> 37:25.760
Oh, I can still have
a sense of humor.

37:25.794 --> 37:28.295
It just took me a second
to get the joke.

37:29.664 --> 37:31.098
Vic's a great guy.

37:31.133 --> 37:33.200
We have a lot of fun.
Mostly during the day.

37:33.235 --> 37:35.970
[laughs]
Okay, I got that one.

37:37.072 --> 37:40.074
He's a few years older.
Decades even.

37:40.108 --> 37:42.943
But I don't care.

37:42.978 --> 37:46.414
He's a wonderful husband.
He's a great father.

37:46.448 --> 37:49.717
I'm sure, because Grant's
a really nice guy.

37:49.751 --> 37:51.719
Oh, thank you.

37:51.753 --> 37:53.954
You just wish he wasn't
sleeping with your daughter.

37:53.989 --> 37:56.991
Are you okay with your son
sleeping with my daughter?

37:57.025 --> 37:59.026
Honestly? Yeah.

37:59.060 --> 38:01.095
I think they're great together.

38:01.997 --> 38:04.365
Hmm. You think it'll last?

38:04.399 --> 38:06.333
Who knows if it'll last?

38:06.368 --> 38:08.936
I mean, my parents never thought
Vic and I would last,

38:08.970 --> 38:10.304
and they're both dead now.

38:10.338 --> 38:12.473
Probably what killed them.
[laughing]

38:13.875 --> 38:15.843
Oh, no...

38:15.877 --> 38:19.113
Was it recently?
That wasn't funny.

38:19.147 --> 38:20.848
Years ago.
[chuckling]

38:20.882 --> 38:24.685
And it was funny.
I just wasn't expectinit.

38:24.719 --> 38:27.988
Oh, you have
a great sense of humor.
Oh, thank you.

38:28.023 --> 38:30.291
I'm really glad Grant
finally introduced us.

38:30.325 --> 38:31.258
Yeah.

38:31.293 --> 38:32.927
I wish we could've
met Jeff tonight.

38:32.961 --> 38:36.130
He's doing some volunteer work
in Africa, in Zimbabwe.

38:36.164 --> 38:38.799
I heard.
And I heard he's a bit younger.

38:38.834 --> 38:40.234
Yes, he is.

38:40.268 --> 38:43.571
But it works for us
most of the time.

38:43.605 --> 38:46.474
I don't know why I said that.
[laughing]
[laughing]

38:47.642 --> 38:49.944
The voice has to have
a personality.

38:49.978 --> 38:52.046
It can't be perfect.
It has to have character.

38:52.080 --> 38:54.982
It's not about the quality
or even the pitch.

38:55.016 --> 38:56.984
It's just got
to say something

38:57.018 --> 38:58.953
about who you are.

38:58.987 --> 39:01.121
And the audience
has to like who you are.

39:02.290 --> 39:04.825
You have to put
your heart into it.

39:05.861 --> 39:08.362
I always put
my heart into it.

39:09.498 --> 39:12.366
Oh, mama!
That one's over the fence!

39:12.400 --> 39:13.801
[chuckles]

39:13.835 --> 39:16.737
That was mine.

39:16.771 --> 39:19.473
And so was
"stee-rike three!"

39:19.508 --> 39:21.542
You know how many guys
have copied that?

39:21.576 --> 39:23.644
Dad. He's joking.

39:23.678 --> 39:26.680
He didn't originate
"stee-rike three."

39:26.715 --> 39:29.483
I can't believe Grant's
never told me
all these things about you.

39:29.518 --> 39:31.552
Well, if he did,
then you could Google me,

39:31.586 --> 39:33.921
and then Grant
might have to worry

39:33.955 --> 39:37.191
that you're only going out
with him because he's my son.

39:37.225 --> 39:38.526
[chuckles]

39:38.560 --> 39:40.728
I would, Dad.
I would totally worry
about that.

39:40.762 --> 39:42.963
Can I tell you, Grace?

39:42.998 --> 39:45.132
This guy here--
he's a keeper.

39:47.002 --> 39:49.470
All I could do
is talk about sports.

39:49.504 --> 39:51.305
This guy's an athlete.

39:51.339 --> 39:53.340
And he's smart.

39:53.375 --> 39:56.010
He was smart enough to say yes
when his gay cousin said,

39:56.044 --> 39:57.912
"I got a girl for you."

39:57.946 --> 40:00.381
And by the way, thank you.
Thank you for fixing up Griffin.

40:00.415 --> 40:02.249
It was kind of an accident.

40:02.284 --> 40:05.553
In love,
there are no accidents.

40:05.587 --> 40:09.156
A few swings and misses,
and sometimes an error or two,

40:09.190 --> 40:11.559
but you gotta play
the game with heart.

40:11.593 --> 40:13.794
