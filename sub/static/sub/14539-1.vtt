01:13.973 --> 01:15.736
I have to get home.

01:15.809 --> 01:17.333
Mama's gonna kill me.

01:17.510 --> 01:18.670
No.

01:19.512 --> 01:22.140
You are staying
with me tonight.

01:22.549 --> 01:24.380
Roman wants us there
at nine in the morning.

01:25.318 --> 01:27.843
Raya we've been over his.

01:28.655 --> 01:31.249
It's just a few months
working in a hotel.

01:31.324 --> 01:32.158
Yes, but...

01:32.158 --> 01:35.093
You want to work at Copyshack
like your mother?

01:36.129 --> 01:39.826
He said it was both
of us or nothing!

01:47.607 --> 01:48.266
No.

01:54.347 --> 01:57.407
Fuck your mom!

02:16.736 --> 02:17.704
I'm sorry.

02:17.704 --> 02:19.001
It's 1:30 In the morning.

02:19.072 --> 02:20.640
You don't understand!
Luba wanted me to...

02:20.640 --> 02:24.508
If her mother lets her do
whatever she wants...

02:25.178 --> 02:26.736
You graduated.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.072
You're an adult now.

02:30.683 --> 02:31.877
Do what you want.

03:14.360 --> 03:15.349
Big smile.

03:18.264 --> 03:19.253
Big smile.

03:21.267 --> 03:23.633
Good. What will you
say at the border?

03:26.739 --> 03:29.642
I am Natalya...

03:29.642 --> 03:31.473
I am Natalya Verbova.

03:32.412 --> 03:36.382
I am going to Budapest
to buy carpets for reselling.

03:36.382 --> 03:37.349
Raya.

03:37.850 --> 03:38.475
Hello.

03:39.185 --> 03:40.015
I'm working.

03:42.155 --> 03:43.053
Out. Out.

03:47.694 --> 03:48.592
Out.

04:19.492 --> 04:20.459
Hi, Kathy.

04:24.297 --> 04:26.857
You're in a hurry.
Where's the fire?

04:29.702 --> 04:30.430
Sorry.

05:08.641 --> 05:10.404
- Hi, Mare.
- Hi.

05:13.046 --> 05:14.479
Transfer come through?

05:16.182 --> 05:16.944
No.

05:19.452 --> 05:20.942
You'll find something, hon.

05:23.056 --> 05:23.750
Yes.

05:32.699 --> 05:34.223
- Hi, boys.
- Hi.

05:35.101 --> 05:37.535
Why don't you guys go inside
and help your mom, okay?

05:37.904 --> 05:38.666
All right?

05:41.441 --> 05:42.999
Marie asked me to bring this.

05:43.543 --> 05:44.532
Erin around?

05:45.244 --> 05:46.643
It's nice to see you too, Kath.

05:46.713 --> 05:49.204
- Yes, right.
- You can't hold this against me.

05:49.282 --> 05:51.351
I gave you plenty of
warning on this.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.553
It's not my fault you're
married to that job of yours.

05:53.553 --> 05:55.851
Plenty of warning?
You just sprung this on me.

05:56.055 --> 05:57.824
Look, I'm not going to do this
in front of Erin, okay.

05:57.824 --> 05:59.225
Where is she? Erin?

05:59.225 --> 06:01.523
And actually I'm not
married to my job.

06:01.594 --> 06:02.891
I happen to like it.

06:04.163 --> 06:06.154
I don't see why that has to
make me a bad mother.

06:07.567 --> 06:09.802
Well, it's not my fault the judge
didn't see it that way, Kath.

06:09.802 --> 06:11.861
Thanks, Kyle. Thank
you for bringing that up.

06:13.072 --> 06:15.905
Look, I told you, you're welcome
to come down to Dalton...

06:15.975 --> 06:17.210
It's really simple for me, you know.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.779
I've just got to clear
my mortgage, find a transfer...

06:19.779 --> 06:21.246
really a piece of cake.

06:21.314 --> 06:26.308
Hey, sweetie, how's it going?
Come here.

06:28.354 --> 06:30.686
- Come here.
- No, Kyle, it's fragile.

06:30.757 --> 06:32.554
- How am I supposed to know?
- Hi, Marie. How's it going?

06:32.625 --> 06:34.058
I brought the camping gear.

06:34.494 --> 06:35.256
Thank you.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.552
- Why don't you label them?
- Marie scares me.

06:38.998 --> 06:40.192
I'll tell you a secret.

06:40.266 --> 06:42.461
She scares me too.
Don't tell anyone.

06:43.469 --> 06:45.460
- You okay?
- Yes.

06:46.005 --> 06:46.699
Tell me.

06:51.744 --> 06:52.938
When are you coming?

06:55.615 --> 06:58.641
Sweetie, I'm having a really
hard time finding a transfer.

06:59.852 --> 07:03.811
It might take awhile.
But I'm trying really hard.

07:04.023 --> 07:07.356
I'm going to make it happen, okay?

07:08.861 --> 07:11.330
I don't understand.
There's got to be something.

07:11.330 --> 07:14.834
I have the experience,
I took extra forensic courses.

07:14.834 --> 07:17.564
Kathy. You've done
everything right.

07:18.070 --> 07:19.662
This is just how the cards fell.

07:19.739 --> 07:21.570
Yes, story of my fucking life.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.603
- Look, there's something I heard about.
- Yes.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.772
I didn't think it would
work for you...

07:26.846 --> 07:29.542
what with you trying
to get closer to your kid.

07:30.016 --> 07:31.210
It's incredible money.

07:31.384 --> 07:36.151
A hundred grand tax-free
for six months' work.

07:36.422 --> 07:39.550
Come on, is it legal?
What is this?

07:39.625 --> 07:41.427
It's the contractor that
the government uses...

07:41.427 --> 07:43.588
to provide
peacekeepers in Bosnia.

07:45.331 --> 07:46.195
Bosnia.

08:17.463 --> 08:22.833
You see the bullet marks?
Eye level!

08:35.815 --> 08:38.807
You come here today
as a beacon of hope.

08:41.953 --> 08:46.015
As representatives of
our highest aspirations.

08:46.392 --> 08:48.724
You've been hired by
Democra Security...

08:48.961 --> 08:53.728
to represent the US as monitors
for the United Nations.

08:54.567 --> 08:55.434
In the next few months...

08:55.434 --> 08:59.427
you will protect the rule of law
where lawlessness is run rampant.

08:59.939 --> 09:03.204
The 1995 Dayton Peace
Accords ended this war...

09:03.276 --> 09:06.973
dictating that an
international police task force...

09:07.113 --> 09:11.049
you, would smooth the
transition from war to peace.

09:11.851 --> 09:12.818
During your training...

09:12.818 --> 09:16.652
you will see that peace is
harder won than war.

09:17.790 --> 09:19.781
That every morning's
hope is haunted...

09:21.127 --> 09:22.651
by yesterday's nightmare.

09:25.131 --> 09:27.429
As representatives of
the United Nations...

09:27.700 --> 09:31.329
we stake our highest values,
even our lives...

09:32.171 --> 09:34.071
on the belief that
we can rebuild.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.034
We must renew...

09:37.109 --> 09:39.600
and we will witness
the rebirth of this country.

09:52.792 --> 09:54.020
It'll settle down.

10:01.734 --> 10:04.328
- You been here before?
- This is my second mission.

10:04.403 --> 10:06.098
You came straight
from the Academy?

10:06.172 --> 10:09.403
No, I'm not a cop.
I work in administration.

10:10.309 --> 10:13.676
You only need
a high school diploma...

10:13.746 --> 10:15.941
and to be over 21 to get in.

10:17.416 --> 10:18.906
What about you?
What brought you here?

10:21.287 --> 10:23.187
I heard the food
was really great.

10:27.159 --> 10:28.751
I thought the war was over.

10:29.629 --> 10:30.755
De-mining.

10:33.065 --> 10:34.862
- You okay?
- Yes.

10:37.336 --> 10:38.268
I'm great.

10:46.178 --> 10:49.048
I'm serious. He couldn't
move off the mine...

10:49.048 --> 10:51.175
for eight days
and eight nights.

10:51.317 --> 10:53.285
So he's demanding time
and a half for nights.

10:53.352 --> 10:55.718
Best part is that now...
sue me!

10:56.355 --> 10:57.913
How about that?

10:58.524 --> 11:02.790
You still seeing the little guy?

11:04.030 --> 11:05.725
Kathy, meet Fred Murray.

11:06.298 --> 11:07.595
- Hi.
- Pleasure.

11:07.767 --> 11:09.530
Hi, guys.
We got a match.

11:09.635 --> 11:12.001
High stakes tournament situation.
US versus Holland.

11:12.171 --> 11:13.160
Come on, let's go.

11:14.974 --> 11:16.208
- Yes!
- Come on!

11:16.208 --> 11:19.177
Come on, yes!

11:21.681 --> 11:23.115
What are you doing?

11:23.115 --> 11:25.484
You suck at pinball and
you suck at football.

11:25.484 --> 11:27.475
Who do you think
invented pinball?

11:27.787 --> 11:28.387
Can you play?

11:28.387 --> 11:31.023
- Can I play! Hold this.
- Okay. Alright.

11:31.023 --> 11:32.547
- She's having the last one.
- The last one.

11:32.625 --> 11:35.617
- You know? You got to pull it.
- Yes, she knows, okay.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.856
- Okay, come on.
- Just watch this.

11:39.031 --> 11:40.157
- Here we go!
- Shit!

11:43.769 --> 11:45.634
Let's go, let's go.

11:48.541 --> 11:49.473
Damn it!

11:49.675 --> 11:50.676
Sorry, guys. I don't know
what happened.

11:50.676 --> 11:52.371
Who's not going to
buy the drinks?

11:52.778 --> 11:54.575
I don't know what
happened there.

11:54.680 --> 11:56.807
I would love some whisky and...

12:03.389 --> 12:05.289
- Don't use...
- Shit!

12:05.624 --> 12:08.694
Sorry, you can't use both
flippers at the same time.

12:08.694 --> 12:11.492
- Flippers?
- Yes, these are called flippers.

12:12.398 --> 12:13.956
Well, this is
the way I was taught.

12:14.700 --> 12:16.998
- With a man behind you?
- Girls.

12:17.269 --> 12:19.567
See, bam bam.

12:21.841 --> 12:23.502
Bam bam, because
it has to bounce off.

12:23.642 --> 12:24.973
This move still get you laid?

12:26.345 --> 12:27.710
Well, in Holland it does.

12:45.131 --> 12:46.723
I'm really out of practice.

13:29.608 --> 13:31.200
Gentlemen.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.981
So where do we sign
to say we came?

13:39.485 --> 13:41.419
You sign...

13:42.955 --> 13:45.357
I think you have to sign
at the end of the session.

13:45.357 --> 13:47.382
- No. Why?
- No, no.

13:47.827 --> 13:52.498
It says right here, "UN mandate
requires you to sign at the end..."

13:52.498 --> 13:55.201
Yes, but this paper is no good.
The new policy is...

13:55.201 --> 13:59.729
Leave her alone.
They try it out with everyone.

14:00.105 --> 14:02.539
You sign them in,
they bugger off.

14:02.608 --> 14:03.939
McVeigh. You're Kathy?

14:04.009 --> 14:06.671
- Yes.
- Welcome to paradise.

14:06.745 --> 14:07.404
Follow me.

14:08.414 --> 14:13.285
Okay, gentlemen. If you have
nothing better to do today...

14:13.285 --> 14:16.880
I would like you to start
investigating two new stabbings...

14:17.923 --> 14:19.618
four new shootings...

14:20.359 --> 14:21.724
and a wee man
with a broken leg...

14:21.794 --> 14:23.557
who can barely
remember his name.

14:24.563 --> 14:26.963
First one. In here.

14:29.368 --> 14:30.630
Gather around.

14:35.241 --> 14:36.037
Kathy.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.038
Why don't you take this, please?

14:43.482 --> 14:44.583
Facial contusions...

14:44.583 --> 14:46.185
from repeated
beatings with fist.

14:46.185 --> 14:47.413
Lacerations on the eye...

14:47.486 --> 14:49.078
caused by the
edge of an iron.

14:49.722 --> 14:52.524
Left arm was
the first entry point...

14:52.524 --> 14:54.185
of a large
kitchen knife.

14:55.027 --> 14:57.257
Okay, Mama, I'm just
going to lift this up.

15:04.103 --> 15:05.866
It's all right.

15:15.147 --> 15:17.342
- Who did this?
- Looks like the husband.

15:18.050 --> 15:19.608
Okay, that's the case.

15:20.386 --> 15:22.320
Who's taking it and
what's their first step?

15:34.700 --> 15:35.792
I will take it.

15:36.235 --> 15:37.327
Very good.

15:38.237 --> 15:38.896
I will take it.

15:44.576 --> 15:46.601
All right. Calm down.

15:47.313 --> 15:48.644
What did he say?

15:52.851 --> 15:56.150
Say woman is Muslim
and she deserved it.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.188
That's enough. Stop it!

16:01.493 --> 16:02.391
Hands off.

16:08.467 --> 16:11.300
Moving on. Next case.

16:13.105 --> 16:16.097
Go. Everyone outside.

16:19.545 --> 16:21.536
Kathy, you too.

16:22.548 --> 16:24.641
Excuse me. What do
you mean moving on?

16:24.717 --> 16:26.582
Who's going to investigate
and make an arrest?

16:26.652 --> 16:28.176
This is a felony assault.

16:28.253 --> 16:29.584
Okay, let me ask you something.

16:30.089 --> 16:31.488
Can you tell a
Serb from a Croat...

16:31.557 --> 16:32.489
or a Bosniak?

16:33.492 --> 16:37.792
Because I can. Racial hatred
started a war in this country.

16:37.930 --> 16:40.799
And as much as I'd like to be,
we aren't here as investigators.

16:40.799 --> 16:42.232
We monitor. That's it.

16:42.901 --> 16:45.131
Sometimes stepping back
is part of the job.

16:50.476 --> 16:54.378
Zlata has been in the hospital
eight times because of her husband.

16:54.913 --> 16:56.938
Each time she tried to make complaint...

16:57.349 --> 16:58.839
my bosses send her home.

16:58.917 --> 17:01.112
They laugh at her.
They laugh at women in Bosnia.

17:01.653 --> 17:03.120
They laughed at mo mother even.

17:03.188 --> 17:06.555
And they do not prosecute
domestic violence.

17:09.261 --> 17:10.785
Yesterday you wanted to help.

17:12.164 --> 17:14.325
Now you can show me
how to do this.

17:18.771 --> 17:21.204
So this is the hospital report.

17:22.074 --> 17:24.098
You have no police reports.

17:28.247 --> 17:33.184
What you need to do is investigate
this as if it were a felony assault.

17:33.552 --> 17:35.349
So if you go back to the hospital...

17:35.421 --> 17:37.890
and get every single
doctor who treated her...

17:37.890 --> 17:41.348
to testify, then you
might have a chance.

17:41.760 --> 17:42.624
But you'll have to...

17:42.694 --> 17:45.162
cross reference every injury...

17:46.165 --> 17:48.100
with other cases...

17:48.100 --> 17:49.624
where courts ruled felony assault.

17:51.036 --> 17:52.604
If our court rule...

17:52.604 --> 17:55.164
that stabbing a man
in a bar is criminal...

17:56.175 --> 18:00.874
then the same should apply
to a woman in her home.

18:05.617 --> 18:09.644
I have considered the evidence...

18:09.721 --> 18:11.848
and rule in favour in Zlata Sehik.

18:31.210 --> 18:32.871
- Hello.
- Hello.

18:33.912 --> 18:36.972
Don't mind him.
He's a complete wimp.

18:39.885 --> 18:41.443
You've been stirring things up.

18:42.387 --> 18:44.923
Ms. Rees, if I
over-stepped protocol...

18:44.923 --> 18:46.325
with the Zlata Sehick case...

18:46.325 --> 18:47.587
Would you call me Madeleine?

18:51.830 --> 18:55.960
You've just done in two months...

18:56.602 --> 18:59.503
what we failed to do
in four years. Sit down.

19:00.172 --> 19:02.197
- Want some tea?
- Yes, please.

19:02.274 --> 19:04.443
Viko Mezovic
did a great job...

19:04.443 --> 19:07.071
but you've just facilitated
the first conviction...

19:07.479 --> 19:12.382
for domestic violence since
the end of the war in Bosnia.

19:13.152 --> 19:18.920
It was very basic police work.
Thank you.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.083
It's just my job.

19:20.259 --> 19:23.660
You can't imagine how that makes
you stand out around here.

19:24.796 --> 19:29.824
The IPTF have a
Gender Affairs Office here.

19:29.902 --> 19:32.871
And the current head left...

19:32.938 --> 19:35.532
and I think you're
the right person to take over.

19:44.583 --> 19:45.208
Well...

19:46.518 --> 19:47.485
Are you up for it?

19:52.157 --> 19:54.352
- Hello.
- Hi, Sweetie.

19:55.594 --> 19:57.084
Did you get the stuff I sent?

19:57.563 --> 19:58.791
Did Dad say you're not coming back?

19:58.864 --> 20:01.230
Of course I'm coming back.

20:01.300 --> 20:02.699
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

20:03.235 --> 20:04.870
- For Labour Day.
- Well...

20:04.870 --> 20:06.872
Because my friends
are renting a boat and...

20:06.872 --> 20:08.032
I have to stay longer.

20:08.106 --> 20:10.700
Because they've asked me
to be the head of a department.

20:12.344 --> 20:13.011
Well...

20:13.011 --> 20:15.411
But I'm making a lot of money...

20:16.081 --> 20:21.353
so I can move nearer Dad
and I can see you all the time.

20:21.353 --> 20:22.479
That's cool. Hold on.

20:22.588 --> 20:24.453
Sorry, I've got to go, Mom.
I have a game.

20:24.523 --> 20:26.582
- Okay.
- I love you. Bye.

20:26.758 --> 20:27.383
Bye.

21:23.348 --> 21:25.043
- Kathy?
- Yes.

21:25.517 --> 21:28.452
Nick Kaufman,
Contingent Commander.

21:28.520 --> 21:29.821
- Good to meet you.
- Great to meet you.

21:29.821 --> 21:31.254
- How are you?
- Can I give you a hand?

21:31.323 --> 21:33.518
- I'm fine. This way?
- Yeah.

21:34.159 --> 21:35.751
Good having another
American in the mix.

21:35.827 --> 21:38.318
Some people get pissed off,
saying we're taking over.

21:38.730 --> 21:40.129
Makes my life easier.

21:41.099 --> 21:43.192
Especially when it's a good-looking
woman reporting to me.

21:43.268 --> 21:46.135
I don't mean to burst your bubble
but I report to Madeleine Rees.

21:46.705 --> 21:49.308
It's a joint appointment.
And she's Human Rights.

21:49.308 --> 21:53.074
But you're Democra. So ultimately
you're mine at the end of the day.

22:11.096 --> 22:13.632
No, you can't.
Please don't.

22:13.632 --> 22:17.329
Just don't touch. Just step
away from the table, please.

22:17.636 --> 22:20.127
I've had my eyes on
this table for a long time.

22:20.205 --> 22:21.035
This one is mine, lady.

22:21.106 --> 22:22.437
- This is your table?
- This is my table.

22:22.507 --> 22:24.702
I'm sorry to tell you
but this is my table.

22:25.844 --> 22:28.210
I have a new job over at HQ...

22:28.280 --> 22:30.373
with a lot of fancy diplomats.

22:31.316 --> 22:32.715
And for someone in my position this...

22:32.918 --> 22:34.886
- would have this table?
- Yes.

22:34.953 --> 22:36.352
I feel very strongly about it.

22:37.723 --> 22:40.886
- You don't care about my feelings?
- I don't care about your feelings.

22:42.060 --> 22:44.221
- So you're just going to take it?
- I'll tell you what.

22:44.296 --> 22:46.594
If you buy me dinner you
can have the damn table.

22:49.201 --> 22:51.567
- Come on.
- Okay, let's go.

22:55.874 --> 22:58.502
I was married twice.

22:58.977 --> 23:00.103
- Like, two times?
- Yes.

23:00.178 --> 23:03.375
- Two times.
- That's twice.

23:03.882 --> 23:08.842
Yes, once and then again
I messed it up both times.

23:09.221 --> 23:12.315
- What about you?
- Well, technically I'm still married.

23:13.492 --> 23:16.950
It's complicated right now.

23:17.028 --> 23:23.695
Because we are in the middle of
what I would call and ending.

23:24.069 --> 23:25.058
But you're married.

23:25.904 --> 23:28.464
Right. But we are
in the process of...

23:28.540 --> 23:30.599
- Kids?
- Yes, we have two.

23:30.675 --> 23:31.607
- Two?
- Boys.

23:32.244 --> 23:34.405
It isn't that
complicated but it is.

23:34.479 --> 23:36.310
If I slept with you,
I'm going straight to hell.

23:37.215 --> 23:37.977
You are.

23:38.583 --> 23:41.143
Let's get drink first.

23:45.390 --> 23:46.482
I'm sorry...

23:50.662 --> 23:52.027
Sir, put down, sir...

23:55.000 --> 23:56.058
Total goat fuck!

23:56.134 --> 23:59.433
Musical apartments!
Just hold the people back.

23:59.504 --> 24:00.471
What do you need me to do?

24:01.506 --> 24:03.701
The Muslim women are supposed to
get their old apartments back.

24:03.775 --> 24:05.003
Serbs took them during the war.

24:05.076 --> 24:05.644
Serbs don't want to leave.

24:05.644 --> 24:07.339
And a lot of places
got sold to third-party...

24:07.412 --> 24:09.141
Croats or God knows what!

24:09.214 --> 24:11.650
And everyone's pissed. And I
figured it's a bunch of widows, so...

24:11.650 --> 24:13.485
your Gender Office can handle it.

24:13.485 --> 24:15.009
Okay.

24:15.086 --> 24:16.018
- Bolkovac.
- Yes.

24:16.087 --> 24:17.054
They need you. Come on.

24:17.522 --> 24:19.217
Murray, can you deal with it?

24:19.291 --> 24:21.623
I'll take this then.

24:23.128 --> 24:25.961
She was talking but I couldn't
understand. She's not local.

25:01.199 --> 25:02.860
All right.

25:04.669 --> 25:05.829
I'm not going to touch you.

25:06.404 --> 25:07.462
I won't touch you.

25:22.354 --> 25:24.185
What is it? Are you in pain?

25:26.992 --> 25:29.256
Oh God, this girl is seriously ill.
Could you call a medic?

25:30.095 --> 25:31.562
Somebody call an ambulance!

25:33.999 --> 25:35.400
Raya, are you okay?

25:35.400 --> 25:36.801
She was further back in the woods.

25:36.801 --> 25:37.768
It's me, Irka. Wake up!

25:39.638 --> 25:42.807
They make raid!
They abuse the girls.

25:42.807 --> 25:44.604
Okay, calm down.
Take a breath.

25:45.076 --> 25:46.668
Nine girls there.

25:47.078 --> 25:48.409
Nine girls there.

25:48.580 --> 25:49.808
- Help them!
- Where?

25:49.915 --> 25:51.473
- Florida Bar.
- Florida Bar?

25:51.550 --> 25:54.041
- What is Florida Bar?
- It's one of the bars in the hills.

25:55.253 --> 25:56.855
I can take them
to the Zenica Shelter.

25:56.855 --> 25:58.686
That's where we usually
take these girls.

25:59.224 --> 26:00.213
Usually?

26:01.993 --> 26:04.484
Where is the bar?
How do I get there?

26:41.266 --> 26:42.392
What's happening here?

26:48.873 --> 26:50.101
What's going on here?

26:51.076 --> 26:53.878
- IPTF told us to come.
- Really? That's interesting.

26:53.878 --> 26:55.436
Since when do you listen to us?

26:55.747 --> 26:57.681
Where are they?
I don't see any monitors.

26:58.149 --> 26:59.616
Lady, what do you want?

26:59.751 --> 27:02.811
I got called to come here
to take the girls to Zenica.

27:02.887 --> 27:04.855
- So I'm here.
- What's Zenica?

27:04.923 --> 27:09.553
Mothersuckers. I don't pay
you fucking Smurfs no more.

27:09.628 --> 27:12.563
What's he talking about?
What does he mean, pay?

27:17.168 --> 27:20.505
- What did he say?
- I don't know.

27:20.505 --> 27:23.906
I am Bosniak and he is Croat
and I don't understand Croat!

27:23.975 --> 27:25.875
Bullshit!
I know you understand him.

27:27.112 --> 27:28.010
Smart lady.

27:28.113 --> 27:32.072
- What's in Zenica?
- It's a woman's shelter.

27:32.784 --> 27:35.218
You know, the whores
get a good meal.

27:36.187 --> 27:41.489
They can talk about problems.
It's like a vacation for them.

27:41.960 --> 27:42.949
Very funny.

29:09.614 --> 29:10.706
Oh my God.

31:22.780 --> 31:24.270
Jesus Christ.

31:49.607 --> 31:50.403
Quickly!

31:51.743 --> 31:52.641
Over here.

31:53.044 --> 31:54.978
- Is this the Zenica Shelter?
- Yes.

31:56.347 --> 31:58.577
We have to be careful.

31:59.450 --> 32:01.782
Sometimes they watch.

32:01.853 --> 32:03.946
- Traffickers.
- Traffickers?

32:04.022 --> 32:06.650
Yes. Human trafficking.

32:12.630 --> 32:17.431
These girls were
abducted and sold.

32:20.838 --> 32:26.470
They are told they must
work off their debt.

32:30.315 --> 32:32.579
And then they'll be let go.

32:34.752 --> 32:36.549
But they never are.

32:40.491 --> 32:42.686
Since the end of the war...

32:42.760 --> 32:46.526
sex trafficking has
spread like cancer.

32:50.768 --> 32:52.702
Why since the end of the war?

32:53.237 --> 32:55.899
Half our men are dead.

33:00.078 --> 33:03.775
So who are these girls
brought in for?

33:15.193 --> 33:18.720
This is our volunteer nurse.

33:26.738 --> 33:30.902
She says Raya has bad infection.

33:31.476 --> 33:37.608
- The nurse found objects inside her.
- Excuse me?

33:38.983 --> 33:39.813
Coins.

33:41.185 --> 33:45.144
Like you saw,
they are not prostitutes.

33:45.590 --> 33:48.923
They are slaves,
treated like dogs.

33:49.327 --> 33:50.885
Do you have a doctor here?

33:52.397 --> 33:53.955
We don't have doctor.

33:55.500 --> 33:59.561
Try the Global Displacement Agency.

34:02.273 --> 34:06.300
If they keep them or not,
I don't know.

34:15.585 --> 34:19.750
Wait, please.
There were other girls?

34:19.891 --> 34:22.951
The ones who were
from the Florida Bar.

34:23.094 --> 34:25.152
The police brought them
here about an our ago.

34:25.496 --> 34:29.226
Here? No police came.

34:32.670 --> 34:33.637
Are you sure?

34:34.639 --> 34:36.902
These girls never arrived.

34:43.313 --> 34:44.940
I'm looking for Laura Levin.

35:05.369 --> 35:08.736
Okay. We'll see you later.

35:09.674 --> 35:11.005
I'm Kathy Bolkovac...

35:11.075 --> 35:12.770
I'm the new Head of Gender Affairs.

35:12.844 --> 35:15.369
I heard. Congratulations.
I'm Laura Levi.

35:15.480 --> 35:17.675
What nationalities
are we dealing with here?

35:20.551 --> 35:23.349
I presume these two women
want to be repatriated.

35:23.454 --> 35:24.822
I don't know.

35:24.822 --> 35:27.484
Actually, I brought them here
because they need medical attention.

35:28.226 --> 35:30.251
We'll get them
to the medical centre.

35:30.328 --> 35:32.888
As soon as we get clearance,
we'll know where we stand.

35:33.498 --> 35:36.058
Clearance? What does that mean?

35:36.501 --> 35:39.095
I'll do whatever
I can to help...

35:39.170 --> 35:43.402
but I have to determine if they'll
cooperate with the repatriation program.

35:43.674 --> 35:45.972
That's the only way
I can let them stay here.

35:46.144 --> 35:48.169
It's not me, it's policy.

35:48.246 --> 35:49.714
I see, policy.

35:49.714 --> 35:51.841
One more thing
I just wanted to ask you.

35:52.083 --> 35:55.814
The other girls from the raid were
supposed to go to the Zenica Shelter...

35:55.887 --> 35:57.252
but they never arrived.

35:57.421 --> 36:01.858
Really? Why don't you check
the IPTF message boards?

36:02.693 --> 36:05.662
Listen, half the time
these raids are for show.

36:05.863 --> 36:09.321
I'm sure the owner has paid off
whoever he had to by now.

36:09.567 --> 36:12.468
You missing girls are
probably back at the bar.

36:15.139 --> 36:16.106
Excuse me now.

36:23.814 --> 36:28.444
LAST 12 HOURS
FLORIDA BAR RAID

36:30.321 --> 36:31.652
PROCESSANDO

36:32.256 --> 36:35.350
NO RESULTS FOUND FOR
"FLORIDA BAR RAID"

36:40.298 --> 36:41.332
LAST 12 HOURS

36:41.332 --> 36:44.426
9th DISTRICT DUTY OFFICER

36:56.781 --> 37:00.808
- Murray, mind if I join you?
- Yes, have a seat.

37:02.653 --> 37:05.315
- Not eating?
- No, I just have a quick question.

37:05.623 --> 37:07.523
You know the raid
you ordered last night?

37:07.959 --> 37:10.828
Local police said they were
taking the girls to Zenica...

37:10.828 --> 37:12.090
but they never showed up.

37:13.864 --> 37:14.853
Fucking mess!

37:15.900 --> 37:17.868
It's the locals dragging us
into their turf war.

37:18.102 --> 37:19.136
Some cop from another canton...

37:19.136 --> 37:21.297
calls in a fake tip
about a prostitution bust.

37:21.372 --> 37:24.739
But the bar is legit and
the girls just waitresses.

37:25.443 --> 37:26.432
Waitresses?

37:29.313 --> 37:30.746
I doesn't hurt to be
thorough, though, right?

37:35.086 --> 37:36.110
Yes, right.

37:36.821 --> 37:38.311
Thing is I found padlocked rooms...

37:38.389 --> 37:40.992
young women's passports and
there was a lot of US currency.

37:40.992 --> 37:42.584
Where are we going, Columbo?

37:45.363 --> 37:49.561
I don't know, but something
fucked up is going on.

37:55.039 --> 37:59.408
Honey, it's like I say,
this is Bosnia.

37:59.844 --> 38:01.971
These people
specialize in fucked up.

38:03.581 --> 38:04.639
And speaking of which...

38:05.082 --> 38:07.710
we've got another
goatfuck in Gorazde...

38:07.785 --> 38:09.980
- so catch you later.
- See you later, guys.

38:18.462 --> 38:20.089
Should have seen this place.

38:20.464 --> 38:23.763
There were pictures all over the
walls of guys with those girls.

38:24.935 --> 38:28.371
And almost every single
guy in there is ours.

38:33.144 --> 38:34.771
I saw one of your guys there.

38:35.212 --> 38:37.772
- You saw one of my guys there?
- Yes, he was wearing your flag.

38:41.052 --> 38:42.349
You want to ask me something?

38:44.221 --> 38:45.313
I guess I do.

38:46.824 --> 38:47.756
Okay, listen.

38:50.728 --> 38:53.754
I've heard about theses places.
I know they exist.

38:53.998 --> 38:55.761
I know my guys go up
there once in awhile.

38:55.833 --> 38:59.929
I figures for strippers or sex.
I don't know. I haven't been there.

39:00.004 --> 39:02.973
I know nothing about any girls
being locked up. What the fuck?

39:06.711 --> 39:07.473
Okay.

39:09.413 --> 39:10.402
I'm sorry.

39:18.189 --> 39:19.486
At home...

39:21.592 --> 39:27.258
I worked in a precinct
where there were 25 guys.

39:28.766 --> 39:29.733
And I new them really well.

39:31.068 --> 39:33.434
I knew them really well.
I knew every one of them.

39:33.604 --> 39:35.333
I know their families.

39:35.406 --> 39:40.969
I know everything about them
and I trust them completely.

39:45.683 --> 39:47.241
I was dumb enough...

39:48.486 --> 39:51.887
to think I'd be joining some
elite police officers here.

39:54.191 --> 39:56.216
But I don't know
who these people are.

40:04.902 --> 40:09.073
Three, two, one, clear.

40:09.073 --> 40:09.664
Kaufman!

40:12.943 --> 40:17.505
- Is it okay for me to be here?
- Sure. Just wait there.

40:23.754 --> 40:24.482
What's up?

40:25.890 --> 40:27.721
You finally come
and see me in action.

40:27.792 --> 40:29.692
I live to see you in action.

40:32.363 --> 40:33.489
This is for you.

40:34.098 --> 40:38.262
I think Fred Murray's taking
payoffs from brothels.

40:38.969 --> 40:42.530
And it's not prostitution.
The girls were trafficked.

40:43.941 --> 40:45.169
The problem is...

40:46.143 --> 40:48.668
who investigates,
how to charge him?

40:50.047 --> 40:51.947
All the international
personnel have immunity.

40:52.016 --> 40:53.415
The can't be prosecuted.

40:54.518 --> 40:56.383
But this is a good work, Bolkavac.

40:58.055 --> 41:00.421
I think it might even deserve
a dinner out with yours truly.

41:02.159 --> 41:03.558
Don't think I've earned that.

42:22.940 --> 42:24.407
Girls, how are you doing?

42:30.681 --> 42:32.046
Did you get some rest?

42:38.355 --> 42:40.289
I went to the Florida Bar...

42:40.591 --> 42:43.526
and I saw the room in the back and
I know what's been happening to you.

42:43.661 --> 42:44.593
Good for you.

42:46.130 --> 42:47.154
Can we go now?

42:47.598 --> 42:49.361
What happened to the girls?

42:49.667 --> 42:53.194
Did you see my friend Luba?
Is she safe?

42:54.772 --> 43:00.369
No. The police took
the girls back to the bar.

43:03.280 --> 43:05.043
But we can still help your friend.

43:05.783 --> 43:09.378
I believe the bar was raided
because Tanjo, the owner...

43:09.453 --> 43:11.751
was refusing to
pay this man money.

43:17.328 --> 43:18.226
Is that true?

43:23.267 --> 43:25.135
I know you're scared to talk, but...

43:25.135 --> 43:30.708
if you can tell me that
this is the man, then...

43:30.708 --> 43:31.538
Then what?

43:33.410 --> 43:34.775
You put him in jail?

43:37.181 --> 43:39.479
No, he has diplomatic immunity.

43:39.583 --> 43:42.853
That means he's
protected by the UN.

43:42.853 --> 43:44.616
But Tanjo can go to jail.

43:45.656 --> 43:46.748
He can go to jail.

43:47.558 --> 43:49.389
And if you both say in a court...

43:50.728 --> 43:54.994
that Tanjo has been taking
payoffs from this man...

43:55.332 --> 44:00.269
then his name will go on record
and the UN has to do something.

44:01.538 --> 44:04.507
They can't knowingly have
one of their men involved...

44:04.575 --> 44:06.372
in rape, kidnapping and torture.

44:06.443 --> 44:09.606
How do you do this
if you work for the UN?

44:10.014 --> 44:11.845
I'm an American police officer.

44:11.915 --> 44:13.177
It doesn't matter who I work for.

44:13.250 --> 44:15.218
I wouldn't let anybody
get away with this.

44:15.953 --> 44:17.147
So if we go to court...

44:18.022 --> 44:19.956
you promise you
can stop these men?

44:21.191 --> 44:24.194
I can't promise I can
stop all these men. I promise...

44:24.194 --> 44:26.992
If you cannot promise
then why do we agree?

44:28.699 --> 44:31.532
There is too much danger
to go speak in a court.

44:31.769 --> 44:34.363
Even this, to say anything to you.

44:34.772 --> 44:36.763
How do I know this is safe?

44:42.312 --> 44:43.745
You're a smart girl.

44:51.455 --> 44:52.786
I have a daughter.

44:56.427 --> 44:58.156
She was taken away from me.

45:00.931 --> 45:02.193
And I can't change that.

45:07.771 --> 45:10.001
But maybe I can change
what happens to you.

45:22.252 --> 45:23.742
Will we be safe?

45:24.722 --> 45:25.416
Yes.

45:28.559 --> 45:29.685
Do you promise?

45:34.598 --> 45:35.656
I promise.

45:43.240 --> 45:43.865
Hello.

45:44.041 --> 45:46.510
I'm calling from the
Global Displacement Agency...

45:46.510 --> 45:47.602
in Sarajevo.

45:47.678 --> 45:49.839
Do you have a
daughter named Rayisa?

45:50.214 --> 45:50.942
Yes. Yes.

45:51.348 --> 45:53.077
We have her here.

45:53.150 --> 45:55.448
If everything checks out...

45:55.619 --> 45:58.850
we will send her home
in a few days.

45:59.223 --> 46:00.349
I'll come there now.

46:00.691 --> 46:01.358
I'm sorry, we can't afford.

46:01.358 --> 46:04.293
I'll pay for it.
Just tell me where to go.

46:10.634 --> 46:12.465
Roman will be home soon.

46:21.478 --> 46:23.776
Roman seems to be doing well.

46:24.715 --> 46:25.545
Milk?

46:26.917 --> 46:28.646
I need to borrow money.

46:35.225 --> 46:37.659
They found Raya in Sarajevo.

46:38.562 --> 46:40.189
I want to go and get her.

46:41.098 --> 46:42.725
I don't need much.

46:50.841 --> 46:51.933
Does he still hit you?

47:03.687 --> 47:05.746
You know I hate to ask.

47:07.457 --> 47:09.015
But she's my daughter...

47:11.161 --> 47:13.095
and your niece. Please.

47:18.435 --> 47:19.834
I will get you the money.

47:20.571 --> 47:24.530
But you have to go.
Roman will be home soon.

47:24.608 --> 47:28.567
He won't give it to me
if he knows it's for you.

47:45.495 --> 47:48.259
You need an armoured security
vehicle for two teenage girls?

47:48.966 --> 47:49.933
What the hell did they do?

47:50.267 --> 47:51.427
None of your business.

47:53.103 --> 47:55.970
Okay, well, it's tough today.

47:56.039 --> 47:58.200
They sent most of our
convoy up to Tesla.

47:58.275 --> 47:59.676
Found some war criminal.

47:59.676 --> 48:00.301
Shit!

48:00.377 --> 48:01.901
I can push for end of the week.

48:01.979 --> 48:03.606
Never mind. Don't worry about it.

48:04.147 --> 48:06.672
But I'll put it through.
You never know, right?

48:18.729 --> 48:19.923
Is Viko around?

48:20.430 --> 48:22.990
Viko, your girlfriend is here.

48:23.800 --> 48:24.824
Come on, let's go.

48:29.373 --> 48:32.206
The van just sits here.
It's no problem.

48:32.276 --> 48:34.344
It is not armoured like you want...

48:34.344 --> 48:37.211
but it'as heavy like tank.

48:37.748 --> 48:39.807
So it's okay.
They don't build them like this.

48:39.883 --> 48:43.649
So we go straight to the
safe house. Here's the address.

48:44.054 --> 48:47.956
After they make
statement in court, yes?

48:48.025 --> 48:49.458
I made the call, so it's okay.

49:00.270 --> 49:01.294
Where is Irka?

49:03.173 --> 49:04.834
I need to have a word with you.

49:04.908 --> 49:06.239
Okay. Hey, Raya.

49:08.645 --> 49:09.737
There was a problem.

49:09.880 --> 49:11.871
During repatriation procedures...

49:11.949 --> 49:14.645
we realized Irka had no passport.

49:15.319 --> 49:19.949
Okay, so we get her one.
Where is she?

49:20.023 --> 49:23.459
You don't understand.
She was trafficked from Grozny.

49:23.527 --> 49:25.324
Her parents were
killed in Chechnya...

49:25.395 --> 49:27.454
and she has no documentation.

49:27.564 --> 49:29.794
No embassy will recognize her.

49:29.866 --> 49:31.424
She is a girl without a country.

49:31.501 --> 49:33.162
Okay, you're not
answering my question.

49:33.236 --> 49:34.396
Where is Irka?

49:35.272 --> 49:37.706
We handed her over to
the police a few hours ago.

49:37.774 --> 49:40.902
How could you do that?
Viko, take Raya.

49:41.144 --> 49:43.580
- So you meet us when you're done?
- Yes.

49:43.580 --> 49:44.706
- Come on, let's go.
- Raya, I'll see you soon.

49:44.781 --> 49:46.180
- Okay?
- It's okay.

49:46.316 --> 49:47.943
How could you do that?

49:49.019 --> 49:52.113
I couldn't keep her.
She didn't have the paperwork.

49:52.322 --> 49:53.516
This is bullshit!

49:53.590 --> 49:56.286
Every case needs to be justified.

49:56.626 --> 50:00.289
I know what you think
but it's an uninformed opinion.

50:00.430 --> 50:02.125
We have a system that works here.

50:02.199 --> 50:04.724
Really? For who?

50:05.302 --> 50:09.932
- Sorry, I look for Laura Levin.
- That's me.

50:16.613 --> 50:17.307
Hi.

50:21.018 --> 50:22.280
Ou know where they took her?

50:23.086 --> 50:24.951
The police take them to the border.

50:25.789 --> 50:26.585
Once they've crossed...

50:26.656 --> 50:29.181
there is one less
trafficking victim in Bosnia.

50:29.793 --> 50:31.761
Taked the 761 to Visegrad.

50:56.019 --> 50:57.145
Hi, I'm looking for a girl.

50:57.220 --> 50:58.983
The police dropped her
here a few hours ago.

50:59.056 --> 51:00.580
Could you check the border logs?

51:00.657 --> 51:02.488
She's 15 years old, no passport.

51:02.626 --> 51:03.820
Okay.

51:04.127 --> 51:07.255
Lady, I know what you look for.

51:08.031 --> 51:10.659
Those girls do not
go through there.

51:10.834 --> 51:11.926
They go through there.

51:13.770 --> 51:16.898
To Serbia, if they survive.

51:17.207 --> 51:18.231
Jesus.

51:51.274 --> 51:52.172
Irka!

51:53.210 --> 51:54.472
Leave me alone!

51:57.214 --> 51:57.976
Go home!

51:59.783 --> 52:01.444
Irka, please wait.

52:04.087 --> 52:05.054
You promised.

52:09.593 --> 52:10.389
Irka!

52:11.128 --> 52:12.390
Stop doing that!

52:19.836 --> 52:20.666
Please.

52:21.938 --> 52:24.304
Just let me die.

52:24.975 --> 52:29.378
I'm sorry. Irka, I'm sorry.

52:29.913 --> 52:30.538
No.

52:31.815 --> 52:32.713
It's okay.

52:33.116 --> 52:37.348
Alright, alright.

52:37.521 --> 52:39.512
Alright, alright.

53:02.646 --> 53:04.981
It's okay.
It will be over soon...

53:04.981 --> 53:06.915
then you go home
with your mother, okay?

53:23.934 --> 53:25.299
Where's the other girl?

53:25.702 --> 53:27.101
Where's the other girl?

53:29.739 --> 53:31.206
She's not here. Let's go.

53:47.224 --> 53:50.660
We'll do whatever we can
to get Raya back.

53:55.265 --> 53:56.698
I'm truly very sorry.

54:11.815 --> 54:14.181
What will they do to her?

54:18.154 --> 54:20.622
What will they do to her?

54:43.346 --> 54:48.010
I want to show you what happens
when you talk to the devil.

54:48.218 --> 54:50.186
Now. Bring her in.

55:05.468 --> 55:10.337
Watch. Make sure
they are watching.

55:17.414 --> 55:19.245
Open your eyes.

56:06.996 --> 56:08.623
Take a good look.

56:08.832 --> 56:11.892
Look at your fucking friend now.

56:45.168 --> 56:46.192
What happened?

56:49.773 --> 56:52.207
The car must have
been following us.

56:55.545 --> 56:58.343
- Do you know who they were?
- No.

57:01.551 --> 57:04.987
Nobody at my station
knew where I was going.

57:06.523 --> 57:09.014
Did you tell anyboy at IPTF?

57:17.066 --> 57:18.465
Madeleine, I need to see you.

57:31.114 --> 57:33.378
This is Peter Ward.

57:34.350 --> 57:34.941
Hello.

57:35.752 --> 57:38.744
Peter's an old friend,
Internal Affairs.

57:41.057 --> 57:44.618
So, Kathy, have you
and any report on Raya?

57:45.895 --> 57:46.486
None.

57:50.099 --> 57:51.868
Kathy, from now on...

57:51.868 --> 57:54.860
I want you to run your
investigation alongside Peter.

57:55.271 --> 57:56.704
The best way to find Raya...

57:56.773 --> 57:59.537
is to continue your
investigation into Fred Murray.

57:59.843 --> 58:03.779
- You handed in a vehicle request to IPTF.
- Yes.

58:04.614 --> 58:07.378
The traffickers obviously
knew where you'd be...

58:08.184 --> 58:09.811
so there's a leak.

58:11.454 --> 58:14.480
I know that cops don't like
to work with Internal Affairs...

58:14.557 --> 58:18.618
but considering what just
happened, it's our only way.

58:27.971 --> 58:29.939
I don't know how to move foward.

58:31.140 --> 58:33.404
I've lost two witnesses.
Raya.

58:33.576 --> 58:37.034
Irka won't testify now,
she's too terrified.

58:37.413 --> 58:42.112
Do you think Fred Murray is only
getting payoffs from one bar?

58:43.353 --> 58:44.012
No.

58:44.721 --> 58:46.450
So ther could be other girls...

58:47.090 --> 58:49.957
willing to testify
against Fred Murray.

58:51.261 --> 58:52.285
It's possible.

58:52.362 --> 58:55.593
Well, if you can get any of these
girls to testify in court then...

58:56.533 --> 58:59.058
there'd be something quite
substantial to work with.

59:00.637 --> 59:01.501
I agree.

59:16.352 --> 59:17.114
Thank you.

59:19.956 --> 59:23.860
I don't want to put any of
you in a dangerous position...

59:23.860 --> 59:26.420
and ask you to speak out
against your traffickers.

59:28.031 --> 59:31.558
I just want to know if
you recognize this man.

59:43.413 --> 59:45.745
Maybe give them some time.

59:47.183 --> 59:53.918
I'll ket you know if
anyone says anything.

59:54.357 --> 59:55.085
Okay.

59:59.696 --> 01:00:03.257
Milena, would you show them
this photograph, too?

01:00:05.068 --> 01:00:07.559
Just maybe someone has heard
something about her.

01:00:11.808 --> 01:00:15.005
You look for this girl?

01:00:23.086 --> 01:00:24.576
She is okay?

01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:29.083
No. No, she's not.

01:00:31.427 --> 01:00:32.416
Do you know her?

01:00:35.064 --> 01:00:35.621
No.

01:00:48.544 --> 01:00:53.277
But I know him.

01:00:56.653 --> 01:01:01.716
He comes in the same
group every month...

01:01:02.558 --> 01:01:05.152
to take money from lvan.

01:01:05.228 --> 01:01:07.355
- He came in a group?
- Yes.

01:01:08.765 --> 01:01:12.201
I want to show you
some other photographs.

01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:19.970
If you could tell me if any
of these people were in the group.

01:01:21.477 --> 01:01:22.739
That is Paolo.

01:01:25.615 --> 01:01:29.107
He liked pain.
He liked weird things.

01:01:29.385 --> 01:01:31.114
He wanted me to like too...

01:01:40.897 --> 01:01:42.865
This made my price go down.

01:01:45.568 --> 01:01:50.562
I know then, it will take me
two more years to pay my debt.

01:01:54.077 --> 01:01:56.409
He buys girls for other men...

01:01:57.513 --> 01:01:59.037
and puts them in apartments.

01:02:03.586 --> 01:02:06.953
Soldiers pay money to
own girls for themselves.

01:02:09.225 --> 01:02:11.887
Check it out, three grand
and she's all mine.

01:02:12.528 --> 01:02:14.462
Luc got one for 25 hundred.

01:02:14.831 --> 01:02:16.423
Turn around,
let me see your ass.

01:02:21.104 --> 01:02:23.231
When we come through checkpoint...

01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:25.471
he drives the van.

01:02:27.810 --> 01:02:28.367
What?

01:02:28.611 --> 01:02:31.171
Him. He was the driver.

01:02:33.282 --> 01:02:38.845
This man drove you
in a van across the border...

01:02:41.357 --> 01:02:42.346
into Bosnia?

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:44.919
Yes.

01:02:47.263 --> 01:02:48.662
We stop at border.

01:02:49.065 --> 01:02:51.192
See man in blue like you.

01:02:52.835 --> 01:02:53.961
I thank God.

01:02:55.404 --> 01:02:57.201
I think we have our saviour.

01:03:03.246 --> 01:03:06.704
Then he jumps in
and drives the van.

01:03:14.624 --> 01:03:16.216
Madeleine, they're
bringing them in.

01:03:18.127 --> 01:03:22.791
IPTF are actually trafficking girls
and bringing them across the border.

01:03:24.734 --> 01:03:27.430
And it's not just IPTF.

01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:33.740
This involves all
kinds of internationals...

01:03:33.976 --> 01:03:36.501
from military
officers to diplomats.

01:03:37.346 --> 01:03:39.678
I thought I was only
going after one guy.

01:03:43.853 --> 01:03:45.980
I had no idea what
I'd be handing over.

01:03:50.193 --> 01:03:52.718
Get this off to Peter
as quickly as you can.

01:04:03.239 --> 01:04:09.007
Are you sure you want to go ahead
'cause there'll be no going back after?

01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:11.779
Yes, ma'am.

01:04:13.449 --> 01:04:14.177
Right.

01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:54.355
You work in two hours.

01:05:08.804 --> 01:05:11.432
You sleep on whichever
mattresses are free.

01:05:13.943 --> 01:05:15.376
They bring us food
in the morning.

01:05:16.479 --> 01:05:18.413
You have to eat it all,
or you get fined.

01:05:21.617 --> 01:05:22.379
Come sit down.

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:33.125
Don't let them see you like this.

01:05:33.963 --> 01:05:34.588
Okay?

01:05:36.966 --> 01:05:38.331
What is your name?

01:05:40.136 --> 01:05:43.105
Raya Kochan.

01:05:49.512 --> 01:05:55.007
I've nearly paid my debt.
Then I can go home.

01:05:56.786 --> 01:05:59.220
- It's all bullshit.
- No.

01:06:00.723 --> 01:06:03.283
He sent a girl back
three months ago.

01:06:04.026 --> 01:06:04.890
I was here.

01:06:07.697 --> 01:06:08.686
What is your name?

01:06:13.336 --> 01:06:15.736
She is Luba. Luba Pallch.

01:06:25.514 --> 01:06:29.280
I'm afraid we can't keep
you here any longer.

01:06:31.887 --> 01:06:35.015
I'll let you know if I hear anything.

01:06:40.429 --> 01:06:43.956
We'll do anything we can
to get Raya back.

01:06:53.642 --> 01:06:55.837
- Kathryn Bolkovac?
- Yes.

01:06:56.379 --> 01:06:58.108
You're wanted in Human Resources.

01:06:58.180 --> 01:06:59.545
- Now?
- Yes, now.

01:07:13.496 --> 01:07:16.363
- Sorry to keep you waiting here.
- No problem.

01:07:16.899 --> 01:07:17.957
John Blakely.

01:07:18.034 --> 01:07:20.002
Kathy Bolkovac.
Nice to meet you.

01:07:20.403 --> 01:07:21.233
Have a seat.

01:07:23.272 --> 01:07:26.139
- So you keeping busy?
- Yes.

01:07:26.842 --> 01:07:31.802
Your superiors, they tell me
that you're working hard.

01:07:32.915 --> 01:07:34.075
I enjoy my work.

01:07:35.384 --> 01:07:37.716
You're dedicated, thorough.

01:07:39.088 --> 01:07:39.782
Thank you.

01:07:40.623 --> 01:07:43.922
Tough stuff, though, your area.

01:07:45.694 --> 01:07:46.558
Stressful.

01:07:50.699 --> 01:07:53.031
Do you ever worry about burnout?

01:07:55.805 --> 01:07:58.000
No. Never.

01:08:00.209 --> 01:08:01.870
You must miss your daughter.

01:08:06.415 --> 01:08:11.648
It's unusual that a judge would
award custody to the father?

01:08:16.292 --> 01:08:20.062
I would imagine there's almost
some kind of a stigma around that?

01:08:20.062 --> 01:08:22.121
What did you want
to talk to me about?

01:08:24.265 --> 01:08:27.599
I'm sorry. I just wondered.

01:08:29.205 --> 01:08:32.675
Because we award
special paid leave...

01:08:32.675 --> 01:08:35.234
to folks who work
in stressful departments.

01:08:35.678 --> 01:08:38.738
You know, parents specially,
we really encourage it.

01:08:38.814 --> 01:08:41.908
And you'd have some time to
hang out with your daughter.

01:08:43.152 --> 01:08:45.916
Nice little jaunt around
Europe, see the sights.

01:08:48.189 --> 01:08:49.850
I'm going to have
to think about it.

01:08:50.693 --> 01:08:52.251
You're not the maternal type?

01:10:09.572 --> 01:10:10.300
Bitch.

01:10:16.011 --> 01:10:17.808
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

01:10:17.913 --> 01:10:19.073
Go home before you get...

01:10:19.582 --> 01:10:23.074
We're watching you. You'd better
to shut your mouth, you fucking...

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:27.187
Kathy, we need to meet.
It's important.

01:10:27.456 --> 01:10:30.050
And be careful. Make sure
you're not followed.

01:10:31.794 --> 01:10:34.729
Kathy, we need to meet.
It's important.

01:10:35.464 --> 01:10:37.455
And be careful.
Mek sure you're no followed.

01:10:41.503 --> 01:10:42.299
Fuck!

01:11:30.953 --> 01:11:33.581
The world and its mother knows
about my investigation.

01:11:35.024 --> 01:11:35.649
I know.

01:11:40.162 --> 01:11:42.130
- Would you like something to drink?
- No.

01:11:42.197 --> 01:11:43.323
- Do you mind if I...
- Go ahead.

01:11:44.099 --> 01:11:47.296
Kathy, Internal Affairs is
shutting down all your cases.

01:11:47.703 --> 01:11:48.465
Why?

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:53.301
All of your files look like this.

01:11:54.276 --> 01:11:56.176
FILE CLOSED

01:11:57.579 --> 01:11:58.705
Jesus.

01:11:59.315 --> 01:12:01.078
I've been completely steam-rolled.

01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:03.718
They've sent Fred Murray home
on some kind of leave.

01:12:03.786 --> 01:12:05.454
And top level
military commanders are...

01:12:05.454 --> 01:12:07.820
are walking into my office
and pulling your files.

01:12:08.490 --> 01:12:10.822
I've never seen I.A.
Over-ridden like this before.

01:12:10.893 --> 01:12:12.121
Over-ridden by who?

01:12:13.362 --> 01:12:14.556
I don't know.

01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:20.225
I mean, I can't be sure.

01:12:21.503 --> 01:12:24.301
It's the State Department.
Or Democra.

01:12:26.375 --> 01:12:28.777
You do know what they
stand to lose if they...

01:12:28.777 --> 01:12:29.744
I guess not.

01:12:30.612 --> 01:12:33.376
Their contract in Bosnia
is worth millions.

01:12:33.549 --> 01:12:35.608
Globally, just this year alone...

01:12:35.684 --> 01:12:38.414
billions of dollars in
US government contracts.

01:12:38.587 --> 01:12:40.487
And now you
come along with this scandal...

01:12:40.556 --> 01:12:42.547
I don't want a scandal.
I'm just doing my job.

01:12:42.624 --> 01:12:45.218
I know, but it doesn't matter.
Nobody cares about you.

01:13:05.013 --> 01:13:07.345
I'll get you the rest of
your files back from I.A.

01:13:07.483 --> 01:13:09.974
You get them out of here,
take them public.

01:13:10.119 --> 01:13:11.984
Or this will never
see the light of day.

01:13:14.156 --> 01:13:15.919
I can't leave these girls.

01:13:16.091 --> 01:13:17.786
You're not helping them here.

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:19.052
And, franfly, you're not
safe to walk around.

01:13:19.128 --> 01:13:21.426
It's completely exposed you.

01:13:21.663 --> 01:13:23.324
Kathy, accidents happen.

01:13:24.566 --> 01:13:27.057
A car blows a tire,
a mine explodes.

01:13:27.536 --> 01:13:29.629
We don't have to
report civilian deaths.

01:13:35.577 --> 01:13:37.044
I'll get you the rest of these.

01:13:37.112 --> 01:13:39.410
And you get yourself the hell out
of here as soon as you can.

01:13:39.481 --> 01:13:42.575
Trust me. This is
the right thing to do.

01:14:01.203 --> 01:14:02.431
I was so stupid.

01:14:02.504 --> 01:14:05.098
I thought I could work
inside the system.

01:14:05.207 --> 01:14:06.608
Like I knew what I was doing.

01:14:06.608 --> 01:14:10.374
Like I knew how to play ball
with all these fancy diplomats.

01:14:12.514 --> 01:14:14.106
I don't know.
What would you do?

01:14:18.153 --> 01:14:19.518
I have to go home.

01:14:23.559 --> 01:14:25.117
My wife got a lawyer.

01:14:27.362 --> 01:14:28.989
I have to go home for the kids.

01:14:34.236 --> 01:14:35.464
I'm so sorry.

01:14:43.212 --> 01:14:44.770
But I'm worried about you.

01:14:47.316 --> 01:14:48.340
Don't be.

01:14:50.552 --> 01:14:51.416
I don't want...

01:14:53.255 --> 01:14:55.621
I don't want to leave you
in the middle of all this.

01:14:56.091 --> 01:15:00.858
I don't want this to be the end.

01:15:16.245 --> 01:15:17.507
Please be careful.

01:15:48.677 --> 01:15:49.735
What is it?

01:15:52.047 --> 01:15:53.742
- We have to get out of here...
- Don't...

01:15:54.616 --> 01:15:56.481
You'll get us in trouble.

01:16:00.188 --> 01:16:00.916
Go.

01:16:06.295 --> 01:16:08.058
I want to take you home.

01:16:08.430 --> 01:16:09.192
Ivan.

01:16:10.198 --> 01:16:13.835
Come. How much do you want
me to pay for these girls...

01:16:13.835 --> 01:16:14.597
to take home?

01:16:14.670 --> 01:16:16.228
- You want to take them home?
- Yes!

01:16:16.405 --> 01:16:18.907
It's ten times normal.
It's three thousand each.

01:16:18.907 --> 01:16:20.807
Sorry, not this one.

01:16:20.876 --> 01:16:22.366
Sorry, not this one.
She's trouble.

01:16:25.714 --> 01:16:27.341
Thank you.
I'm sorry, sir.

01:16:30.385 --> 01:16:31.443
So just this one?

01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:34.079
You bring the girl back,
I give you the deposit back, okay?

01:16:34.156 --> 01:16:34.747
Okay.

01:16:34.923 --> 01:16:36.584
Venha, lhe darei uma bebida.

01:17:10.892 --> 01:17:12.120
Sign at the bottom, please.

01:17:47.929 --> 01:17:49.260
- Yes?
- It's Viko.

01:17:49.498 --> 01:17:52.126
- I can't talk right now, Viko.
- I think I know where Raya is.

01:17:55.737 --> 01:17:56.465
Okay.

01:18:29.337 --> 01:18:31.567
We have a bit of a problem.

01:18:32.307 --> 01:18:33.638
What kind of problem?
Where's the girl?

01:18:42.417 --> 01:18:43.850
All right. All right.

01:18:49.524 --> 01:18:50.650
There you go, Raya.

01:18:50.926 --> 01:18:52.761
- What did she say?
- Names of girls. Raya.

01:18:52.761 --> 01:18:54.285
Raya? Raya is there?

01:18:54.362 --> 01:18:56.626
All right. Calm down, you're okay.

01:18:56.698 --> 01:18:58.033
- We go to Oasis?
- Yes.

01:18:58.033 --> 01:18:58.829
And IPTF?

01:18:59.367 --> 01:19:01.699
Fuck protocol.
We just raid the bar.

01:19:15.083 --> 01:19:15.674
Here.

01:19:16.118 --> 01:19:18.143
- You trust these guys?
- Yes, I do.

01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:20.347
- They're going to listen to you?
- Out!

01:19:20.989 --> 01:19:21.978
You sure?

01:19:23.592 --> 01:19:25.253
I do trust them. Let's go.

01:19:48.183 --> 01:19:48.808
Hello?

01:20:05.433 --> 01:20:07.936
We need to bring the owner here.
We arrest him outside.

01:20:07.936 --> 01:20:08.960
I don't want him
threatening the girls.

01:20:09.070 --> 01:20:10.094
Okay. Go! Go!

01:20:36.965 --> 01:20:38.865
Okay. Go! Go!

01:20:43.371 --> 01:20:45.669
We have a warrant
to search these premises.

01:20:46.041 --> 01:20:48.976
Ivan Bradzic has been arrested
for human trafficking.

01:20:49.044 --> 01:20:50.102
Get out of here.

01:20:50.212 --> 01:20:52.772
You don't have to be afraid
of lvan. He can't hurt you.

01:20:53.715 --> 01:20:55.444
We're going to get you
somewhere safe...

01:20:55.817 --> 01:20:57.341
and help get you home.

01:20:57.986 --> 01:21:00.318
Raya. Raya. Come on.

01:21:07.362 --> 01:21:10.058
These girls work here.

01:21:10.632 --> 01:21:12.793
They have all documents.

01:21:13.501 --> 01:21:14.695
Passports.

01:21:15.237 --> 01:21:18.070
And you can fuck off!

01:21:18.139 --> 01:21:18.867
Really?

01:21:21.276 --> 01:21:23.244
Fakes. Bad ones.

01:21:23.311 --> 01:21:24.710
And you, too.

01:21:24.779 --> 01:21:25.413
And you, yoo, fuck you!

01:21:25.413 --> 01:21:27.313
Okay, Viko, get the blankets
out of the van...

01:21:27.449 --> 01:21:29.110
and get these girls out of here.

01:21:29.417 --> 01:21:31.408
Okay, girls, come on.
You're safe.

01:21:31.586 --> 01:21:34.282
Just come. All right, come.

01:21:34.356 --> 01:21:34.913
Let's go.

01:21:34.990 --> 01:21:35.824
Don't be afraid.

01:21:35.824 --> 01:21:37.553
We can all go now.
Raya, come on.

01:21:37.626 --> 01:21:39.685
It's going to be okay.
All right?

01:21:39.794 --> 01:21:41.853
Come on, Raya. Let's go.

01:21:43.531 --> 01:21:44.759
Come on, what's the matter?

01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:47.097
What? What's the matter?

01:21:48.436 --> 01:21:49.664
What the fuck are you doing here?

01:21:50.071 --> 01:21:51.595
We got a call about this raid.

01:21:52.107 --> 01:21:53.131
From who?

01:21:56.578 --> 01:21:57.272
Get out.

01:21:59.614 --> 01:22:01.582
Come on, get out. Out!

01:22:01.650 --> 01:22:04.519
Get out right now!

01:22:04.519 --> 01:22:05.508
Get your hands off me.

01:22:06.454 --> 01:22:07.216
Fuck!

01:22:12.627 --> 01:22:15.494
Don't look at these guys.
Don't be afraid of theses guys.

01:22:16.197 --> 01:22:18.533
Just say you want to go
and I can walk you...

01:22:18.533 --> 01:22:21.502
Raya, I can walk you
out of here, right now.

01:22:21.803 --> 01:22:23.828
You just have to say
you want to go, that's all.

01:22:25.106 --> 01:22:27.597
Don't look at him.
Look at me.

01:22:28.009 --> 01:22:29.169
I want you to look at me.

01:22:29.711 --> 01:22:32.271
You are safe.

01:22:32.447 --> 01:22:35.348
Listen to me, don't look at him.

01:22:35.717 --> 01:22:38.618
Just get out! Fuck!

01:22:39.087 --> 01:22:42.147
Okay, Raya, just
look at me. Please.

01:22:45.093 --> 01:22:48.330
Just say yes.

01:22:48.330 --> 01:22:49.456
It's all you have to do.

01:22:53.168 --> 01:22:56.797
Raya, please.
Just say you want to go.

01:22:59.407 --> 01:23:00.135
No.

01:23:01.676 --> 01:23:02.836
Just say you want to go.

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:05.671
No.

01:23:12.821 --> 01:23:16.450
Fuck! What the fuck is
the matter with you?

01:23:16.858 --> 01:23:18.126
Don't you know anything!

01:23:18.126 --> 01:23:21.629
We are supposed to
protect these people.

01:23:21.629 --> 01:23:23.031
You're a crazy bitch!

01:23:23.031 --> 01:23:24.328
...to protect these people.

01:23:24.599 --> 01:23:27.502
- I know this girl.
- I know you do.

01:23:27.502 --> 01:23:28.628
I know this girl.
I can't leave her her.

01:23:28.703 --> 01:23:30.933
Come on, Raya. Let's go.

01:23:31.373 --> 01:23:33.273
I can't leave her here.

01:23:33.575 --> 01:23:34.376
I can't leave her here.

01:23:34.376 --> 01:23:35.900
Iook at me! Kathy!

01:23:37.078 --> 01:23:38.807
We cannot force them.

01:23:40.115 --> 01:23:43.175
Nothing will hold up in court.
Please understand.

01:23:43.718 --> 01:23:46.243
They will be brought
down here, punished.

01:23:47.022 --> 01:23:48.489
You want blood on your hands?

01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:53.361
- You piece of shit.
- Get out form here.

01:23:53.361 --> 01:23:56.626
You piece of shit. You fuck!

01:23:56.698 --> 01:23:59.724
- What is the matter with you people?
- Get the fuck out of here!

01:23:59.901 --> 01:24:01.562
What is the matter with you?

01:24:41.509 --> 01:24:43.443
My husband
arranged me for a job.

01:24:44.846 --> 01:24:47.406
But his friend
bought me for $2,000.

01:24:47.515 --> 01:24:50.575
With renewed funding drom USAID...

01:24:50.652 --> 01:24:52.554
the Global Displacement Agency...

01:24:52.554 --> 01:24:56.388
continues to be a pioneer at
international couter-trafficking.

01:24:56.458 --> 01:24:59.427
My sister arranged
for my papers.

01:25:00.195 --> 01:25:03.926
Her boyfriend did this
for 12 other girls.

01:25:04.165 --> 01:25:06.497
Most traffickers prey
on those they know...

01:25:06.568 --> 01:25:08.832
banking on the fact that
the girl will trust them.

01:25:09.037 --> 01:25:13.474
Traffickers can be fathers,
brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles...

01:25:31.359 --> 01:25:33.122
I wanted to tell you.

01:25:41.336 --> 01:25:43.167
It's how you pay for this.

01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:48.436
Roman, he does...

01:25:52.013 --> 01:25:53.412
How could you...

01:25:57.418 --> 01:25:59.579
sell your own blood?

01:26:03.892 --> 01:26:05.291
You swine.

01:26:08.630 --> 01:26:10.188
You swine.

01:26:15.103 --> 01:26:16.468
You swine.

01:26:20.408 --> 01:26:22.205
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

01:26:22.977 --> 01:26:24.746
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

01:26:24.746 --> 01:26:25.838
Where is she?

01:26:27.282 --> 01:26:30.115
Where is she?
Where is she?

01:26:30.285 --> 01:26:34.051
Where is she?
Where is she?

01:26:40.428 --> 01:26:41.861
She is no longer your sister.

01:26:43.898 --> 01:26:45.889
Stay away from me.

01:27:10.592 --> 01:27:13.428
Where's Raya?
Where's the little bitch?

01:27:13.428 --> 01:27:17.387
She's in the back.

01:27:20.168 --> 01:27:23.399
I didn't say anything.

01:27:37.986 --> 01:27:39.476
No!

01:27:43.891 --> 01:27:46.587
I didn't say anything.

01:27:55.536 --> 01:27:57.766
Please.

01:28:33.241 --> 01:28:34.265
Are you sure you want to see?

01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:39.978
Excuse me.

01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:07.037
Would you please cover her up?

01:29:08.943 --> 01:29:10.570
Could you find a blanket, please?

01:29:11.212 --> 01:29:12.645
Could you cover her up?

01:30:28.489 --> 01:30:31.856
I am a police officer
obligated to report crimes.

01:30:32.393 --> 01:30:34.262
I have taken
statements from women...

01:30:34.262 --> 01:30:40.292
describing their physical,
psychological and emotional torture.

01:30:41.569 --> 01:30:45.562
On arriving in Bosnia,
these women are sold...

01:30:47.375 --> 01:30:49.969
and forced to provide
sexual services.

01:30:51.546 --> 01:30:54.572
Their clientele
consists of SPOR...

01:30:55.049 --> 01:30:57.643
IPTF, local police...

01:30:58.119 --> 01:31:00.178
and international employees.

01:31:00.755 --> 01:31:05.658
Worse, they have become involved
in the trade itself.

01:31:11.432 --> 01:31:13.901
It is time each and
every one of you realize...

01:31:13.901 --> 01:31:16.369
this is a serious
organized crime...

01:31:18.172 --> 01:31:19.833
with enormous profits.

01:31:24.645 --> 01:31:25.880
We are peacekeepers...

01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:27.848
who came to protect the innocent...

01:31:28.850 --> 01:31:31.876
but now prey upon them
in the worst ways possible.

01:31:35.723 --> 01:31:38.191
We may be accused of
thinking with our heart...

01:31:38.259 --> 01:31:39.658
instead of our heads...

01:31:42.763 --> 01:31:44.663
but we will have our humanity.

01:31:58.913 --> 01:32:01.382
SENDING

01:32:01.382 --> 01:32:01.871
COMPLETE

01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:30.204
Good morning.

01:32:31.012 --> 01:32:32.946
I have to ask you
to surrender your ID.

01:32:34.181 --> 01:32:34.738
What?

01:32:39.754 --> 01:32:40.778
What's going on?

01:32:42.256 --> 01:32:44.486
You've been ordered out
of this mission.

01:32:47.728 --> 01:32:49.195
You can't be serious.

01:32:50.998 --> 01:32:52.226
I'll need the ID.

01:33:03.044 --> 01:33:06.104
- Thank you. Guys...
- Come on.

01:33:13.688 --> 01:33:15.349
Why do you want
to get rid of here?

01:33:15.423 --> 01:33:18.984
Madeleine, I have to protect this
organization and so should you.

01:33:19.193 --> 01:33:21.491
The UN is too fragile,
too important.

01:33:21.796 --> 01:33:23.730
That's what immunity is for.

01:33:23.798 --> 01:33:27.063
Immunity not impunity.

01:33:27.868 --> 01:33:31.031
The United Nations was formed
from the ashes of Auschwitz.

01:33:31.105 --> 01:33:34.506
The United States led the way and
it's a point of honour with me...

01:33:35.743 --> 01:33:37.734
that the UN is not remembered...

01:33:38.045 --> 01:33:41.310
for raping the very people
we must protect.

01:33:44.585 --> 01:33:47.179
Those girls are whores of war.

01:33:48.322 --> 01:33:50.688
I will not dictate for morality.

01:33:51.459 --> 01:33:54.295
So what are we dictating for?
I'll go to Washington.

01:33:54.295 --> 01:33:56.058
I'll go to the State
Department if I must.

01:33:56.130 --> 01:33:58.928
Democra isn't even based out of
the States. It's based out of England.

01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:02.469
It's a private corporation.
We work in the real world.

01:34:28.663 --> 01:34:30.324
Thank you so much.

01:34:30.798 --> 01:34:32.857
Really helpful.

01:34:42.176 --> 01:34:43.871
I had to send that e-mail.

01:34:45.946 --> 01:34:47.277
They killed Raya.

01:34:51.085 --> 01:34:53.178
- They shot her in the head.
- I know.

01:34:56.557 --> 01:34:59.890
She wanted to testify and
they made an example of her.

01:35:02.296 --> 01:35:04.389
I'm responsible for this.

01:35:06.434 --> 01:35:08.299
No, dear, you're not.

01:35:09.136 --> 01:35:11.263
I promised her
I would protect her.

01:35:16.977 --> 01:35:19.707
Oh God, I can't stop
thinking about her mother.

01:35:22.783 --> 01:35:25.115
How do we tell people
what's happening here?

01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:31.489
Democra is registered
in the UK, in Britain.

01:35:33.661 --> 01:35:37.222
So you are entitled
to appeal your dismissal.

01:35:38.199 --> 01:35:41.600
We've got to get those files
out of the mission right away.

01:35:43.304 --> 01:35:48.537
Because you're a whistleblower,
so the press will want to know.

01:35:50.611 --> 01:35:53.136
I handed in my ID and my keys.

01:35:54.949 --> 01:35:55.711
Shit!

01:35:59.220 --> 01:36:00.687
I don't know
how to get in there.

01:36:03.557 --> 01:36:04.956
We'll have to find a way.

01:36:17.772 --> 01:36:19.433
Zoe. Zoe?

01:36:24.478 --> 01:36:25.672
What are you doing here?

01:36:26.714 --> 01:36:28.648
I need to get something
out of my office.

01:36:29.283 --> 01:36:31.717
I was wondering if you
could get me a set of keys.

01:36:34.155 --> 01:36:35.349
Kathy, I can't.

01:36:36.824 --> 01:36:38.792
It's too risky.
I would lose my job.

01:36:40.461 --> 01:36:42.452
I wish I could help, I really do.

01:36:45.566 --> 01:36:47.431
I'm sorry. I'm just not like you.

01:37:19.867 --> 01:37:22.700
- You scared me.
- Sorry, I didn't recognize the coat.

01:37:25.072 --> 01:37:26.266
We don't have much time.

01:37:45.526 --> 01:37:49.292
I can't go up there with you.
You understand, right?

01:37:49.363 --> 01:37:52.423
- Yes.
- Make certain you get everything...

01:37:52.666 --> 01:37:56.102
and that includes any files you
didn't send to I.A. Or to me.

01:37:56.170 --> 01:37:56.727
Yes.

01:37:58.038 --> 01:38:01.269
If anybody's going to believe this,
the press needs to see it all.

01:38:02.443 --> 01:38:06.243
- I'll meet you in the atrium.
- Okay.

01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:40.766
You're an asshole.

01:39:41.809 --> 01:39:44.437
You really didn't think you were
going to get away with this, did you?

01:39:47.915 --> 01:39:49.212
Those look right to you?

01:39:56.357 --> 01:39:58.052
Yes, it's all here.

01:40:00.127 --> 01:40:01.492
You're trespassing.

01:40:02.196 --> 01:40:06.100
So what are you going
to do, fire me again?

01:40:06.100 --> 01:40:09.558
You going to arrest me?
I have diplomatic immunity.

01:40:09.636 --> 01:40:11.763
Isn't that what you all
rely on around here?

01:40:11.839 --> 01:40:13.329
You had immunity.

01:40:13.407 --> 01:40:15.409
You don't have a UN ID anymore.

01:40:15.409 --> 01:40:17.707
You're a civilian now.
You're on your own.

01:40:18.012 --> 01:40:20.981
I'm sure the State Department will be
happy to hear from me when I get back.

01:40:20.981 --> 01:40:22.249
Where do you think
this comes from?

01:40:22.249 --> 01:40:24.018
The State Department
owns your contract.

01:40:24.018 --> 01:40:25.451
They don't want you here.

01:40:25.753 --> 01:40:27.345
Democra wants you out.

01:40:30.824 --> 01:40:33.156
You talk to whoever you want.
They're not listening.

01:40:35.295 --> 01:40:36.262
You're finished.

01:41:18.639 --> 01:41:19.936
Did you get what you need?

01:41:22.910 --> 01:41:24.745
The State Department
owns your contract.

01:41:24.745 --> 01:41:26.007
They don't want you here.

01:41:26.713 --> 01:41:28.203
Democra wants you out.

01:41:29.583 --> 01:41:31.915
You talk to whoever you want.
They're ot listening.

01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:34.509
That's good.

01:41:36.223 --> 01:41:39.659
As soon as you get to London
take this right to the BBC, okay.

01:41:42.062 --> 01:41:43.359
- Thank you, Peter.
- Go.

01:42:18.165 --> 01:42:19.757
I can categorically state...

01:42:19.967 --> 01:42:22.197
not one United Nations officer...

01:42:22.269 --> 01:42:24.965
has been involved in the
trafficking of a single woman.

01:42:25.172 --> 01:42:28.630
You believe all these
victims' claims to be false?

01:42:28.709 --> 01:42:31.200
I don't want to make
accusations against those girls...

01:42:31.345 --> 01:42:33.040
but I will assert
over and over again...

01:42:33.113 --> 01:42:36.446
I run a Zero Tolerance program
for that type of activity.

01:42:36.884 --> 01:42:38.545
Now we've just
set up a full taskforce...

01:42:38.619 --> 01:42:41.554
dedicated to abolishing all
sex trafficking in the region.

01:42:49.696 --> 01:42:50.856
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:42:54.134 --> 01:42:55.567
We spoke to Bill Hynes...

01:42:55.636 --> 01:42:58.400
the senior UN official
in Bosnia at the time.

01:42:58.472 --> 01:43:00.099
I saw that interview.

01:43:00.274 --> 01:43:02.208
And as you watched it,
what did you think?

01:43:03.043 --> 01:43:06.171
I think Mr. Hynes knows
that he made a false statement.

01:43:07.214 --> 01:43:08.772
So you're accusing him of lying?

01:43:09.316 --> 01:43:11.580
Yes. Absolutely.

01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:15.222
We have considered
Democra's explanation...

01:43:15.222 --> 01:43:17.588
as to why they
dismissed Ms. Bolkovac.

01:43:18.392 --> 01:43:21.987
And there is no doubt whatsoever that
the real reason for her dismissal...

01:43:22.529 --> 01:43:24.731
was that she made a
protected disclosure and...

01:43:24.731 --> 01:43:27.791
accordingly was
dismissed unfairly.

01:43:28.135 --> 01:43:30.262
You smuggled files that
belonged to the UN...

01:43:30.337 --> 01:43:31.201
out of the mission.

01:43:32.406 --> 01:43:34.533
Don't you think that was a
rather reckless thing to do?

01:43:34.908 --> 01:43:38.901
Those young women had put themselves
at great risck by confinding in me.

01:43:39.279 --> 01:43:42.077
And I led them to believe that
they would receive justice...

01:43:42.849 --> 01:43:44.282
but we let them down.

01:43:44.918 --> 01:43:47.546
So the least I can do
is let them be heard.

01:43:54.428 --> 01:43:59.456
Given everything you've been
through, would you do it again?

01:44:01.001 --> 01:44:01.729
Yes.

01:44:04.037 --> 01:44:05.026
Yes, I would.

01:44:07.841 --> 01:44:08.933
No doubt about it.
