02:49.560 --> 02:51.040
There she is.

02:56.920 --> 02:58.160
Ma'am.

02:58.160 --> 02:59.960
Welcome to Denford Hill.

02:59.960 --> 03:02.560
I know, the stench
is something else. It's this way.

03:02.560 --> 03:04.680
It's the methane.
Aye.

03:04.680 --> 03:07.360
Me and Kenny reckon this must be
the biggest landfill in the North.

03:07.360 --> 03:08.840
No, second biggest.

03:08.840 --> 03:11.520
Brigwell Quarry's
got a good 50 acres on this.

03:12.520 --> 03:14.480
Right. Take me through it.

03:14.480 --> 03:17.640
Unidentified female.
Mid- to late-20s.

03:17.640 --> 03:20.440
Multiple stab wounds.
Who found her?

03:20.440 --> 03:21.960
Excavation driver.

03:21.960 --> 03:24.720
He turned up
for a six o'clock shift,

03:24.720 --> 03:28.120
then he saw her body in the pit.
This is their first day back.

03:28.120 --> 03:29.280
Back from where?

03:29.280 --> 03:31.360
Refuse workers
were on a 48-hour strike, ma'am.

03:31.360 --> 03:32.440
Lucky for us.

03:32.440 --> 03:34.960
Otherwise she'd be under ten feet
of rubbish by now.

03:34.960 --> 03:36.240
Right.

03:38.120 --> 03:39.320
Kenny.

03:43.160 --> 03:45.920
That pathologist.
Tell me it's not who I think it is.

03:45.920 --> 03:48.320
Yes, Malcolm Donahue.

03:48.320 --> 03:50.120
He transferred back here last week.

03:53.440 --> 03:55.840
It's all I need.
OK.

04:00.120 --> 04:03.480
DCI Stanhope. I hope you weren't
thinking of coming any closer.

04:03.480 --> 04:05.200
Oh, I wouldn't dare, pet.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.560
I know how prickly you get
about boundaries.

04:07.560 --> 04:08.880
I know how prickly you get
Well, they're there for a reason.

04:08.880 --> 04:11.760
And it's good to see you too,
Malcolm.

04:14.480 --> 04:18.279
I count five, maybe six puncture
wounds to her abdomen and chest.

04:19.959 --> 04:23.080
Any idea about weapon?
Something sharp, I would imagine.

04:24.720 --> 04:26.600
And no ID on her?
Nothing.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.520
Well, we did find this...

04:30.400 --> 04:32.440
..in her pocket.
It looks like a receipt.

04:33.720 --> 04:35.480
Other than that,
there's nothing to tell us

04:35.480 --> 04:38.600
who this girl is right now.
Well, this should help.

04:38.600 --> 04:40.240
What about time of death?

04:41.320 --> 04:45.040
Erm... Recent.
I'd say the last 12 hours.

04:46.400 --> 04:47.920
Right.

04:51.840 --> 04:53.720
Not much sign of blood splatter.

04:53.720 --> 04:55.840
Look, I'm just saying.

04:55.840 --> 04:59.400
Probably killed somewhere else. The
body was brought here post-mortem.

05:04.320 --> 05:06.280
Try and do this quick, Malcolm.

05:06.280 --> 05:09.480
I don't want her lying there
any longer than she has to.

05:13.800 --> 05:15.000
Kenny.

05:18.200 --> 05:20.800
Till receipt, 69.99.

05:20.800 --> 05:23.520
Couple of days old. Find the shop.
Yes, ma'am.

05:23.520 --> 05:27.440
Now, Malcolm reckons she was
brought here sometime last night.

05:27.440 --> 05:29.080
Now, if there was a strike,

05:29.080 --> 05:31.720
she didn't come in a bin lorry.
Then, her killer brought her.

05:31.720 --> 05:34.360
Oh, you're on fire this morning,
Aiden.

05:35.480 --> 05:37.680
What's his name?
Peter Lyle, ma'am.

05:39.640 --> 05:42.520
Mr Lyle? You all right?
Yeah.

05:42.520 --> 05:44.800
I'm DCI Vera Stanhope.

05:44.800 --> 05:48.520
That girl. Was she really murdered?
Ah, we don't know yet, love.

05:49.600 --> 05:52.760
But I do need to ask you
about access to the site.

05:52.760 --> 05:55.120
Why, there's only one way in,
through the main gates.

05:55.120 --> 05:59.160
Ah, but if there was a strike,
the gates would be locked, hmm?

05:59.160 --> 06:02.760
I suppose.
So, if someone wanted to sneak in,

06:02.760 --> 06:04.640
how'd they go about that?

06:04.640 --> 06:06.640
The old access road
for the steel-works.

06:07.640 --> 06:09.120
Fly-tippers use it sometimes.

06:10.360 --> 06:13.680
And that from the road to here,
that's what?

06:14.680 --> 06:17.040
200 yards?
Maybe less.

06:18.080 --> 06:19.240
Thanks, love.

06:20.960 --> 06:23.240
Kenny, receipt?

06:23.240 --> 06:27.640
It was issued by Nazeem Fones.
It's a place in Whitley Bay, ma'am.

06:29.160 --> 06:33.560
OK, Jac, I want you to stay here
until Forensics are finished

06:33.560 --> 06:36.080
and get someone to take care
of Mr Lyle.

06:36.080 --> 06:39.400
Now, Kenny, there's an old
access road down here.

06:39.400 --> 06:42.360
Get some uniforms and check it out.
Will do.

06:43.920 --> 06:47.600
Right. Come on.
Let's find out who our victim is.

06:52.720 --> 06:56.160
Yeah, I remember her now.
She was here a couple of days ago.

06:56.160 --> 06:59.480
Did she give her name?
No, just bought a phone.

06:59.480 --> 07:02.920
Did she use a card?
It's cash, according to the receipt.

07:06.040 --> 07:08.360
Where's she going?
Oh, right, yeah.

07:08.360 --> 07:10.560
She didn't have enough.
Went to get more money.

07:10.560 --> 07:12.920
How long was she gone?
Not long.

07:12.920 --> 07:14.920
So, where's the nearest cash point?

07:14.920 --> 07:18.320
Just round the corner, two minutes.
Thanks, love.

07:28.200 --> 07:30.800
ATM provider says,
at the time the phone was bought,

07:30.800 --> 07:32.640
there was only one withdrawal.

07:32.640 --> 07:36.040
The card was registered
to a Joanne Caswell, 26 years old.

07:36.040 --> 07:38.400
Did you get an address?
A house in Jesmond.

07:38.400 --> 07:41.320
Belongs to her parents,
Graham and Ava Caswell.

07:51.240 --> 07:53.880
God's sake! We have to go through
this every time I come round!

07:53.880 --> 07:56.000
Nobody asked you to be here!

07:56.000 --> 07:57.880
I want you to go!
Oh, here we go again!

07:57.880 --> 07:59.120
Here we...
Go!

07:59.120 --> 08:02.200
Get out! Get out!
Do you know, this is my house too!

08:03.840 --> 08:06.920
Mrs Caswell?
Yes?

08:06.920 --> 08:10.200
DCI Vera Stanhope. This is DS Healy.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.640
Can we come in, love?

08:13.880 --> 08:16.560
This is a mistake.
It can't be Joanne.

08:16.560 --> 08:18.360
Yeah, of course it's a mistake.

08:18.360 --> 08:20.440
It's some other poor girl.

08:20.440 --> 08:23.520
So, when did you last speak to her?

08:23.520 --> 08:25.400
I called her last night.

08:25.400 --> 08:28.840
I mean, I left a message.
She didn't pick up.

08:29.880 --> 08:31.360
Ma'am...

08:34.039 --> 08:37.640
Mrs Caswell, is this your daughter,
Joanne? Yes.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.159
I am so very sorry, love.

08:44.960 --> 08:47.560
Oh my God. Oh, my God.

08:54.960 --> 08:57.880
When did you last see her, hmm?

08:57.880 --> 09:00.600
I had dinner with her on Sunday.

09:00.600 --> 09:03.560
You hadn't seen her since Sunday?
No.

09:03.560 --> 09:07.120
During the week, Joanne stays
in the city with her girlfriend.

09:07.120 --> 09:10.480
What's her girlfriend's name?
Melanie Kirk.

09:12.120 --> 09:15.680
Her flat's closer to Joanne's work.
It's an easier commute.

09:15.680 --> 09:18.200
That's where you need
to start looking.

09:18.200 --> 09:19.960
That bloody job of hers.

09:21.520 --> 09:23.080
What is her job?

09:23.080 --> 09:25.240
She's a forensic psychologist.

09:25.240 --> 09:27.360
A trainee with the prison service.

09:27.360 --> 09:30.560
Right, so, you saw her on Sunday.

09:30.560 --> 09:33.600
And... how did she seem?
Was she all right?

09:33.600 --> 09:35.520
She seemed fine.

09:38.440 --> 09:40.640
Actually, I'm not sure
if she was fine or not.

09:41.680 --> 09:43.360
Graham and I separated recently.

09:43.360 --> 09:45.560
He moved out of the house
last month.

09:45.560 --> 09:47.040
What's that got to do with anything?

09:47.040 --> 09:50.200
Just trying to explain that I wasn't
paying attention to Joanne lately.

09:50.200 --> 09:52.960
SHE SOBS

09:57.560 --> 10:00.520
And when did you last see
your daughter, Mr Caswell?

10:01.560 --> 10:05.640
Well, it wouldn't have been
on Sunday, if you've moved out.

10:05.640 --> 10:07.120
No, it wasn't.

10:08.680 --> 10:10.840
I saw her yesterday, as it happens.

10:12.440 --> 10:15.600
We had lunch together.
And where was that?

10:15.600 --> 10:17.960
At The Lorsica. In town.

10:17.960 --> 10:20.560
What time was that?
We finished up around...

10:21.600 --> 10:24.080
..three o'clock.
Joanne had to get back to work.

10:25.640 --> 10:27.440
And how did she seem?

10:28.440 --> 10:30.040
She seemed fine.

10:32.160 --> 10:33.320
Just...

10:36.240 --> 10:38.880
Just normal Joanne.
HE SOBS

10:50.120 --> 10:53.280
And how was her relationship
with her dad?

10:53.280 --> 10:56.480
All right, was it?
Lately, not great.

10:57.720 --> 11:01.240
Graham has found himself
a new girlfriend and...

11:02.480 --> 11:04.200
Younger, is she?

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
Well, he didn't choose
those trainers himself, pet.

11:14.520 --> 11:16.440
Still...

11:16.440 --> 11:20.160
Things can't have been so bad
if they were meeting for lunch.

11:21.400 --> 11:25.120
Joanne Caswell. Aged 26.

11:26.200 --> 11:28.480
She's a trainee
criminal psychologist

11:28.480 --> 11:30.760
with Her Majesty's Prison Service.

11:30.760 --> 11:33.440
Now, there's no obvious motive here.

11:33.440 --> 11:36.520
A young woman, good job, girlfriend.

11:37.520 --> 11:41.760
Parents are separating but, apart
from that, home life is stable.

11:42.720 --> 11:45.680
So how does a lass like that

11:45.680 --> 11:50.760
end up dead
and dumped in a landfill, hmm?

11:50.760 --> 11:54.120
So, background. Mark, emails,

11:54.120 --> 11:57.240
phone records, social media,
the whole shebang.

11:57.240 --> 11:58.720
Now, the last known sighting...

11:58.720 --> 12:00.840
Shouldn't we be looking
into the prison connection?

12:00.840 --> 12:04.360
Well, she'll have worked
with some violent offenders.

12:04.360 --> 12:07.640
Oh, well, thanks for keeping me
on my toes, Mark.

12:07.640 --> 12:10.400
I'll be talking to her boss
just as soon as I've finished here.

12:10.400 --> 12:12.480
Is that all right?

12:12.480 --> 12:15.680
Now, the last known sighting
was yesterday afternoon at three.

12:15.680 --> 12:19.240
She was having lunch
with her father, Graham Caswell,

12:19.240 --> 12:21.640
at The Lorsica Cafe in the city.

12:21.640 --> 12:24.600
Jac, check with The Lorsica.
Confirm she was there

12:24.600 --> 12:27.080
and what time did she leave.
Yes, ma'am. Mark.

12:27.080 --> 12:30.000
I wanna know where she went
after The Lorsica

12:30.000 --> 12:31.800
and start setting up a timeline.

12:31.800 --> 12:35.000
Kenny, where are we with
the access road at the landfill?

12:35.000 --> 12:37.080
I've sent the Forensics team
up there, ma'am.

12:37.080 --> 12:39.560
Right. Well, let me know as soon as.

12:39.560 --> 12:41.240
Now, finally...

12:42.440 --> 12:45.760
..we think she was moved
to the landfill post-mortem,

12:45.760 --> 12:49.760
which means we still need to find
the original murder site.

12:49.760 --> 12:52.040
So, come on, start looking!

12:52.040 --> 12:53.600
Ma'am.

12:53.600 --> 12:56.400
Uniform, they didn't get an answer
from the girlfriend's flat.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.600
The neighbour seems to think
she's in London all week.

12:58.600 --> 13:00.000
Well, they need to find her.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.040
Otherwise, the first
she's gonna hear of this

13:02.040 --> 13:03.520
is when she opens tomorrow's paper!

13:04.520 --> 13:05.920
Come on, we're going to jail.

13:33.920 --> 13:36.080
Mr Wells is just over there.

13:37.680 --> 13:40.600
We're looking for Matthew Wells.
You're here about Joanne?

13:42.480 --> 13:45.840
Oh, sorry. Erm, Sandra Madani,
I'm the office coordinator.

13:45.840 --> 13:47.160
I'll get Matthew.

13:48.880 --> 13:50.880
Matthew, the police are here.

13:53.480 --> 13:55.640
Matthew Wells. Senior Psychologist.

13:55.640 --> 13:58.720
DCI Vera Stanhope. This is DS Healy.

13:59.760 --> 14:02.760
Erm, is there somewhere we can talk?

14:02.760 --> 14:05.960
Joanne was a third year trainee...

14:07.440 --> 14:09.640
..and one of the best
we've ever had.

14:09.640 --> 14:13.400
And such a lovely girl.
So, she was popular?

14:13.400 --> 14:15.960
Very. Everyone liked her.

14:15.960 --> 14:19.000
Was she close with anyone
in particular?

14:19.000 --> 14:21.720
No-one special,
if that's what you mean.

14:21.720 --> 14:25.320
She was all about her work.
And was she in work yesterday?

14:25.320 --> 14:27.920
She was here until lunchtime,
then she left.

14:27.920 --> 14:29.360
But she didn't come back.

14:29.360 --> 14:32.160
Was that unusual,
her not coming back?

14:32.160 --> 14:35.320
Not really.
The office is really just a base.

14:35.320 --> 14:37.280
People come and go.

14:37.280 --> 14:39.160
What sort of work did she do?

14:39.160 --> 14:41.200
Everything from prisoner
risk assessments

14:41.200 --> 14:43.560
to preparing reports for hearings.

14:43.560 --> 14:45.520
So, she did work with prisoners?

14:45.520 --> 14:47.400
Mostly lifers.

14:47.400 --> 14:51.360
Did any of them have an issue
with her? Threaten her?

14:51.360 --> 14:52.840
Well...

14:52.840 --> 14:55.960
..working with prisoners
is always challenging.

14:55.960 --> 14:58.600
Not all of them appreciate
we're trying to help.

14:58.600 --> 15:00.960
Sometimes they can be hostile.

15:02.160 --> 15:03.400
What about Paul Eastman?

15:03.400 --> 15:06.000
That was a one-off event.
What was?

15:08.560 --> 15:10.280
Do you wanna tell us about that?

15:11.880 --> 15:13.280
Eastman is a former prisoner.

15:13.280 --> 15:17.240
He had a run-in with Joanne during
his parole assessment last year.

15:17.240 --> 15:18.880
Well, what sort of run-in?

15:18.880 --> 15:21.360
Eastman got violent.

15:21.360 --> 15:23.240
You said "former prisoner".

15:23.240 --> 15:26.080
He was released four weeks ago.

15:27.120 --> 15:29.320
Well, we're going to need
his address.

15:34.280 --> 15:36.240
Paul Eastman. 36 years of age.

15:36.240 --> 15:39.400
He's been arrested for everything
from possession to GBH.

15:39.400 --> 15:41.440
Bit of an all rounder, then.

15:42.720 --> 15:44.920
Morning.

15:44.920 --> 15:47.760
How long has he been staying here?
About three weeks.

15:47.760 --> 15:51.160
He give you any trouble?
He's got a mouth on him.

16:02.040 --> 16:04.960
Here you are.
Who are you?

16:04.960 --> 16:06.680
Paul Eastman?

16:08.800 --> 16:09.840
Oi!

16:22.840 --> 16:26.600
Shift it, man!
Police! Paul!

16:35.400 --> 16:37.360
I haven't done any...
I haven't done anything.

16:37.360 --> 16:40.480
Yeah? Then, why you running?
Look, you're hurting me.

16:43.120 --> 16:44.680
You can't just swan into my room

16:44.680 --> 16:46.680
and start going through
all my stuff.

16:46.680 --> 16:48.480
Where were you last night?

16:48.480 --> 16:51.200
I was out. We're gonna need
more than that, mate.

16:51.200 --> 16:53.000
At a party.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.080
Wear your white shirt, did you?

17:05.439 --> 17:06.638
Ma'am?

17:07.679 --> 17:11.039
The manager confirms that Eastman
left the hostel yesterday at 2pm

17:11.039 --> 17:13.319
and didn't get back till 4am.

17:13.319 --> 17:16.079
Sounds like quite a party.
I've sent the shirt off for testing.

17:16.079 --> 17:17.679
Let's see what comes back
from the lab.

17:17.679 --> 17:19.358
Right.
Oh, here you are.

17:21.199 --> 17:22.398
What's this?

17:22.398 --> 17:25.319
Incident report on Eastman's attack
on Joanne at Scanton Prison.

17:29.079 --> 17:31.279
Do you mind telling me
what this is all about?

17:31.279 --> 17:33.719
Certainly,
if you'd like to sit down, sir.

17:33.719 --> 17:35.599
Not until you tell me
what this is all about.

17:35.599 --> 17:37.879
Sit down!

17:44.639 --> 17:48.879
Now, then. I need you to tell me
when you last saw Joanne Caswell.

17:49.839 --> 17:51.639
Wait. What's happened?
Is she all right?

17:51.639 --> 17:54.799
No, not really, love.
We found her body this morning.

17:57.559 --> 17:58.639
Oh...

17:58.639 --> 18:00.999
Is there something
you want to tell us, Paul?

18:00.999 --> 18:03.039
Is there something
We know you attacked her...

18:03.039 --> 18:05.999
at your parole assessment
at Scanton last year.

18:07.639 --> 18:09.999
No. No. I didn't attack her.

18:09.999 --> 18:14.399
Well, I've got an incident report
here says you did.

18:17.359 --> 18:19.879
What happened?

18:22.079 --> 18:24.239
I didn't attack Joanne.

18:25.599 --> 18:27.439
She just got in the way,
that's all.

18:28.639 --> 18:31.719
It was him I was going for.
Her boss.

18:31.719 --> 18:34.399
Who, Matthew Wells?
Yeah, Matthew Wells.

18:34.399 --> 18:36.679
He was supposed to be supervising,

18:36.679 --> 18:39.959
but he just couldn't resist
showing off.

18:39.959 --> 18:42.679
Wells made sure that
I got another three month

18:42.679 --> 18:45.159
on top of my sentence
because of that session.

18:51.359 --> 18:53.599
Joanne came to see me two weeks ago.

18:53.599 --> 18:55.639
She came to see you?

18:55.639 --> 18:58.159
What, at the hostel?
Just turned up.

18:59.839 --> 19:02.399
She said Wells was out of order.

19:02.399 --> 19:04.279
I didn't get a fair deal.

19:04.279 --> 19:06.239
She asked me how she could help.

19:06.239 --> 19:09.079
So I told her about my lad, Alfie.

19:09.079 --> 19:12.999
I've been trying to see him,
but my ex wasn't having it.

19:12.999 --> 19:15.439
She persuaded Alfie's mum
to invite me to his birthday.

19:17.079 --> 19:19.759
She even got me a present
to give to him.

19:19.759 --> 19:22.039
And that's where I was last night.

19:22.039 --> 19:24.879
You were at your son's birthday
party till four in the morning?

19:24.879 --> 19:29.279
I was there until it kicked off
between me and Jane's new bloke.

19:29.279 --> 19:33.239
Got kicked out about... ten.
I went to the pub.

19:33.239 --> 19:35.239
It's all a bit of a blur after that.

19:35.239 --> 19:37.399
So, how did you get blood
on your shirt?

19:38.879 --> 19:40.639
It's his blood on the shirt.

19:40.639 --> 19:43.639
Oh, yeah, and you expect me
to believe that? Call Jane.

19:43.639 --> 19:45.799
She'll be too glad to tell you
how I ruined the night.

19:45.799 --> 19:49.679
Oh, we'll be calling her, love.

19:50.839 --> 19:53.639
So, what did she get?
What?

19:54.679 --> 19:56.999
You said she got your lad a present.
What was it?

19:58.479 --> 20:00.719
I asked her to get him a new mobile.

20:13.239 --> 20:16.639
Eastman's ex-wife just confirmed
that he was at the party

20:16.639 --> 20:19.839
until they threw him out.
And she said Joanne was the one

20:19.839 --> 20:23.319
who persuaded her to invite him.
So he's telling the truth.

20:23.319 --> 20:25.359
Let's see what the lab
comes back with on the shirt.

20:27.199 --> 20:29.039
Nah. Let him go.

20:29.039 --> 20:32.799
We know where to find him
if we need him.

20:32.799 --> 20:36.519
But what's our Joanne playing at,
hmm?

20:36.519 --> 20:39.319
Tracking him down to make amends?

20:39.319 --> 20:42.199
Maybe she really did think
Wells gave Eastman a raw deal.

20:42.199 --> 20:45.319
Well, our Wells does sound
like a piece of work.

20:46.759 --> 20:49.119
But she was going above and beyond.

20:49.119 --> 20:53.319
I mean, would you buy a lad
you've never met before a £70 phone?

20:54.479 --> 20:57.239
Erm, ma'am.
Melanie Kirk's been in contact.

20:57.239 --> 20:59.959
She's back at her flat.
Family Liaison have been round.

20:59.959 --> 21:01.839
All right. Thanks, Mark.

21:02.919 --> 21:05.639
Come on, we better go and see
this girlfriend.

21:07.479 --> 21:11.199
I don't understand. I mean...

21:11.199 --> 21:13.039
When did this happen?

21:14.159 --> 21:16.959
Well, sometime last night,
we think.

21:16.959 --> 21:19.919
We tried contacting you earlier,
love,

21:19.919 --> 21:21.759
but you weren't answering
your phone.

21:21.759 --> 21:23.479
Stupid thing died.

21:23.479 --> 21:27.719
What if she was trying to call me?
What if I could've stopped this?

21:27.719 --> 21:30.319
It's best not to dwell
on what-ifs, pet.

21:31.399 --> 21:34.159
Now, your neighbour said
you were in London.

21:34.159 --> 21:35.599
Yeah.

21:35.599 --> 21:39.279
That's right.
I'm opening a gallery in Selburn.

21:39.279 --> 21:43.839
I was... down visiting
some artists' studios.

21:43.839 --> 21:46.159
So, you last saw Joanne...?

21:46.159 --> 21:49.919
Monday morning, so three days ago.

21:49.919 --> 21:51.999
She saw me off at the station.

21:51.999 --> 21:53.839
And how was she?

21:53.839 --> 21:55.239
Fine, I think.

21:56.519 --> 21:59.359
I was running late.
I was worried I'd miss my train.

22:00.399 --> 22:03.239
I'd neglected her recently.
Ah, no.

22:03.239 --> 22:07.639
No, I've seen her phone records.
You called her five times yesterday.

22:07.639 --> 22:09.999
That doesn't sound like neglect.

22:10.999 --> 22:13.359
Just... checking in, I suppose.

22:14.839 --> 22:18.079
What about the last couple of weeks?
How did she seem?

22:20.439 --> 22:22.599
A little withdrawn, maybe.

22:22.599 --> 22:24.159
Any reason for that?

22:25.519 --> 22:27.279
I think work was getting to her.

22:29.719 --> 22:33.239
Now, according to the girlfriend,
Joanne was worried about work.

22:33.239 --> 22:35.919
Now, we know she had a run-in
with one prisoner,

22:35.919 --> 22:40.159
Prince Charming here, so maybe
someone else had issues with her.

22:40.159 --> 22:42.359
Where are we
with her case files, Mark?

22:42.359 --> 22:45.479
Her office just sent them over. I'm
about to start going through them.

22:45.479 --> 22:49.079
Right, well, focus on those
prisoners most recently released.

22:50.199 --> 22:51.919
And do a background
on the girlfriend

22:51.919 --> 22:54.079
while you're at it.
Ma'am.

22:54.079 --> 22:57.879
Now, where are we with Forensics
at the landfill, Kenny?

22:57.879 --> 23:00.959
They found tyre tracks at the access
point and they've taken some casts.

23:00.959 --> 23:02.839
Ma'am?

23:02.839 --> 23:04.919
Just spoken with the manager
at the Lorsica Cafe.

23:04.919 --> 23:06.919
She remembers the Caswells
coming in for lunch,

23:06.919 --> 23:09.119
said they had a row
and Joanne Caswell stormed out.

23:10.879 --> 23:12.839
Did she say what the row was about?

23:12.839 --> 23:16.359
She couldn't say, but she said
Joanne was furious with her dad.

23:17.959 --> 23:19.159
Was she?

23:20.519 --> 23:23.119
Hmm.

23:25.239 --> 23:26.439
If you're looking for Ava,

23:26.439 --> 23:28.479
they took her to identify
Joanne's body.

23:28.479 --> 23:31.999
Ah, no, it's you we're looking for,
Mr Caswell.

23:34.279 --> 23:36.519
Graham, as far as we know,

23:36.519 --> 23:39.879
you're the last person
to be seen with Joanne alive,

23:39.879 --> 23:43.159
so whatever it was about,
we need to know.

23:46.359 --> 23:48.679
My partner, Janet. She's pregnant.

23:49.959 --> 23:52.279
And Joanne was upset because
you're starting a new family?

23:52.279 --> 23:55.079
No, not exactly.
She's pretty far gone.

23:56.519 --> 23:58.079
The baby's due next month.

23:59.119 --> 24:00.439
I'd let Joanne believe that...

24:01.999 --> 24:04.199
..I didn't meet Janet
until after I left her mother.

24:05.319 --> 24:09.279
Ah, so, she realised
you'd been lying to her and her mum.

24:09.279 --> 24:10.799
Yeah, but that's...

24:12.559 --> 24:14.319
..that's not why she walked out.

24:14.319 --> 24:17.439
So, why did she?
I asked her out to lunch to...

24:19.559 --> 24:21.599
..to help me convince Ava
to sell the house.

24:23.159 --> 24:25.919
I don't have a choice.
I've got a baby coming.

24:27.719 --> 24:28.959
Janet's got two of her own.

24:30.359 --> 24:32.399
We need a bigger place.

24:32.399 --> 24:34.319
I'm 59 years old.

24:35.559 --> 24:37.719
Who's gonna give me a mortgage?

24:39.159 --> 24:40.959
I don't know, love.

24:44.879 --> 24:46.719
A right charmer, him.

24:46.719 --> 24:49.159
Stripping his old family
to pay for his new one.

24:49.159 --> 24:51.559
He's a man with problems, all right.

24:52.679 --> 24:56.519
Sounds like you feel sorry for him.
Well, he's pushing 60,

24:56.519 --> 24:59.559
girlfriend half his age
and a new bairn on the way.

24:59.559 --> 25:01.879
I wouldn't wish that on anyone.

25:01.879 --> 25:03.559
Right, I'm going to see Malcolm.

25:03.559 --> 25:05.479
Come on,
I'll drop you at the station.

25:13.199 --> 25:15.199
So, there were six wounds in all.

25:15.199 --> 25:18.239
Four to the abdomen,
two to the upper chest.

25:19.639 --> 25:24.399
The fatal wound broke through
her ribcage and pierced her heart.

25:25.799 --> 25:27.719
Any update on the weapon?

25:27.719 --> 25:30.679
A five- or six-inch blade.
My guess, it's domestic.

25:30.679 --> 25:32.719
Kitchen knife.

25:32.719 --> 25:35.879
Oh, and there are... defence wounds.

25:35.879 --> 25:38.799
Here, right arm, right hand.

25:38.799 --> 25:41.159
Oh, so, she put up a fight.
Mm.

25:42.119 --> 25:43.359
For all the good it did her.

25:44.639 --> 25:47.719
Any sign of sexual assault?
None that I could see.

25:47.719 --> 25:49.359
Ah, small mercies.

25:50.439 --> 25:51.959
What about forensics?

25:51.959 --> 25:53.879
Well, you are aware
that the body was found

25:53.879 --> 25:56.079
on an industrial-sized
landfill site?

25:56.079 --> 25:58.239
Come on, Malcolm,
you must have found something.

25:58.239 --> 25:59.639
Yes, there's plenty of material,

25:59.639 --> 26:01.439
but, unfortunately,
it's all compromised.

26:01.439 --> 26:02.679
Well, can I see it?

26:05.239 --> 26:07.919
Paint traces. Yellow.

26:07.919 --> 26:11.799
On her hair
and on the back of her coat.

26:11.799 --> 26:15.199
So, where's this paint from?
Well, there's no way of telling.

26:15.199 --> 26:17.559
It could easily have transferred
at the landfill.

26:18.599 --> 26:21.199
Or it could come
from the original murder site.

26:21.199 --> 26:23.479
I've missed your optimism.

26:27.079 --> 26:29.999
Ah, I didn't know
she was still here.

26:31.679 --> 26:33.599
Ah, well, it's all right.
Off you go.

26:52.799 --> 26:54.959
Are you all right, love?

26:59.039 --> 27:01.359
I remember the first time
I came here.

27:03.879 --> 27:05.559
Horrible place to be.

27:06.959 --> 27:09.759
This isn't my first time here.

27:09.759 --> 27:11.479
At the end of last year...

27:12.639 --> 27:15.359
..my dad, he had a heart attack
in the supermarket.

27:16.399 --> 27:18.559
This is where they brought him.

27:19.599 --> 27:21.319
Dad was different, mind.

27:23.439 --> 27:26.319
He was old.
He looked like he belonged here.

27:28.079 --> 27:31.079
But not your daughter... eh?

27:31.079 --> 27:32.719
Like she was sleeping.

27:34.719 --> 27:37.719
I wanted to wake her up
and take her home.

27:37.719 --> 27:39.759
SHE SOBS

27:43.639 --> 27:46.959
Who did this to my girl?

27:48.359 --> 27:52.199
We don't know, love. Yet.

27:52.199 --> 27:55.079
Right now,
we're just trying to get a sense

27:55.079 --> 27:57.359
of what was going on in her life.

28:00.119 --> 28:01.799
What do you want to know?

28:01.799 --> 28:06.919
Well, Melanie seems to think Joanne
seemed a little withdrawn lately.

28:06.919 --> 28:11.839
Maybe something to do with work.
Did she mention anything to you?

28:13.639 --> 28:15.519
She was a little distracted...

28:16.959 --> 28:19.439
..but I don't think
that was about work.

28:20.879 --> 28:22.559
There was a text.

28:22.559 --> 28:24.919
A text?
A few weeks ago.

28:24.919 --> 28:27.839
Joanne was upstairs.
She left her phone in the lounge.

28:27.839 --> 28:30.199
It just popped up on the screen
and I read it.

28:30.199 --> 28:31.999
It just popped up on the screen
So, what did it say?

28:31.999 --> 28:33.919
"I need to see you tonight."

28:34.959 --> 28:38.799
And who was it from?
Some girl called Ashleigh.

28:40.359 --> 28:42.519
But when I asked who Ashleigh was...

28:43.519 --> 28:45.559
..Joanne got very defensive.

28:45.559 --> 28:47.439
She didn't want me to know
anything about her.

28:48.839 --> 28:50.439
Mark, I'm on my way back.

28:50.439 --> 28:53.679
Now, listen, it could be
Joanne was seeing someone

28:53.679 --> 28:55.439
other than Melanie Kirk.

28:55.439 --> 28:58.039
Her mam thinks the girl's name
is Ashleigh.

28:58.039 --> 29:01.399
Sent her a text.
Now, I need you to find her, pronto.

29:05.559 --> 29:07.239
What have you got, Mark?

29:07.239 --> 29:10.839
Her phone records show she called an
Ashleigh Beck four times last week,

29:10.839 --> 29:12.919
so I did a bit of digging.

29:12.919 --> 29:16.199
It turns out
she's Simon Beck's sister.

29:16.199 --> 29:18.919
Who's he when he's at home?
He's a lifer at Scanton.

29:18.919 --> 29:20.159
I've got him here, ma'am.

29:22.079 --> 29:24.079
Good work, Mark.

29:25.159 --> 29:27.039
Joanne was assessing him for parole.

29:27.039 --> 29:28.599
Four weeks ago,
he took his own life.

29:28.599 --> 29:30.719
He was a taxi driver from Crowley.

29:30.719 --> 29:35.119
He confessed to the murder of
15-year-old Jordan Payne in 2003.

29:35.119 --> 29:38.719
This lad's body was found
in the woods, just outside Crowley.

29:38.719 --> 29:40.199
The case rings a bell.

29:40.199 --> 29:43.759
According to this, Beck strangled
Jordan after a training session.

29:43.759 --> 29:46.399
What sort of training session?
Football.

29:46.399 --> 29:49.519
Beck also coached Jordan's team.
Crowley Wood Football Club.

29:50.759 --> 29:52.919
Now, where have I seen...?

29:54.919 --> 29:56.959
Aiden, with me.

30:46.244 --> 30:48.044
This Ashleigh...

30:48.044 --> 30:51.844
She can only have been a lass
when her brother was convicted.

30:51.844 --> 30:53.604
That can't have been easy.

30:53.604 --> 30:55.684
I think it's weird
she was going out with the woman

30:55.684 --> 30:57.524
who was assessing her brother
for parole.

30:57.524 --> 31:01.364
Oh, been in this job so long,
nothing seems weird any more.

31:05.044 --> 31:09.004
But I do wanna know why she returned
to Crowley last year.

31:10.804 --> 31:13.004
Well, 15 years after
her brother's conviction.

31:13.004 --> 31:15.004
Maybe she thought everyone
had forgotten.

31:15.004 --> 31:16.844
Places like Crowley?

31:16.844 --> 31:20.004
Nah, people never forget.

31:26.884 --> 31:28.364
Ashleigh Beck?

31:29.644 --> 31:31.324
What do you want?

31:34.244 --> 31:36.204
You been getting some trouble?

31:36.204 --> 31:39.244
They don't scare me.
Well, even so.

31:39.244 --> 31:42.564
There must be easier places for you
to live than Crowley.

31:43.564 --> 31:44.964
What was it you wanted?

31:48.284 --> 31:51.204
We're here about Joanne Caswell.

31:51.204 --> 31:52.444
Why?

31:53.564 --> 31:56.124
What's the problem?
I'm afraid she's dead, love.

31:58.164 --> 32:00.164
Murdered. Two nights ago.

32:01.364 --> 32:02.644
You didn't know?

32:15.124 --> 32:17.084
When did you last speak to her?

32:17.084 --> 32:19.084
I dunno.

32:20.484 --> 32:21.764
Sometime last week.

32:21.764 --> 32:24.324
What was your relationship
to Joanne?

32:27.524 --> 32:30.484
I suppose we were mates.
And nothing more than that?

32:33.044 --> 32:34.044
What?

32:35.524 --> 32:37.124
It was nothing like that.

32:38.204 --> 32:42.964
She was helping me with the case.
Case? What case?

32:46.164 --> 32:48.364
I've been trying to prove my
brother's innocent

32:48.364 --> 32:49.444
I've been trying to prove my
since he went inside.

32:51.404 --> 32:53.284
The conviction was a joke.

32:54.644 --> 32:55.964
It broke my mum and dad.

32:57.204 --> 32:58.724
I want justice for them.

32:58.724 --> 33:01.684
But your brother, he confessed.
A load of crap.

33:01.684 --> 33:03.804
That confession was either forced
or they made it up.

33:03.804 --> 33:06.844
So, what made Joanne decide
to get involved?

33:08.244 --> 33:10.244
Joanne met Simon in prison.

33:11.324 --> 33:14.884
She got to know him.
Soon realised he wasn't a murderer.

33:14.884 --> 33:18.844
Oh, aye? And how did she know that,
then, love? Simon told her.

33:20.404 --> 33:22.604
He told her he was innocent?
Yeah.

33:22.604 --> 33:26.204
Then, why did he take his own life?
They denied his parole.

33:27.444 --> 33:29.204
He thought he was coming home.

33:29.204 --> 33:31.844
I guess,
he couldn't face any more time.

33:33.564 --> 33:36.004
After he died, Joanne found me.

33:36.004 --> 33:37.244
She understood.

33:37.244 --> 33:39.244
She was the only person
who offered to help me.

33:39.244 --> 33:40.884
So, how did she help?

33:40.884 --> 33:43.164
She looked into the original case.

33:43.164 --> 33:44.724
Trying to find new evidence.

33:45.804 --> 33:47.084
Did she find any?

33:48.044 --> 33:49.884
Well, if she did,
she didn't tell me.

33:51.124 --> 33:54.044
But it is out there. It has to be.

33:55.404 --> 33:57.124
Simon wasn't a killer.

34:02.244 --> 34:04.884
Here you are. Get it while it's hot.

34:06.604 --> 34:09.884
If Joanne was looking
into the Beck case...

34:11.764 --> 34:14.083
..maybe she found something.

34:14.083 --> 34:16.804
What, something that got her killed?
Mm.

34:16.804 --> 34:19.083
If she was looking into it.

34:19.083 --> 34:22.563
But why would she help out Ashleigh?
Why did she help Paul Eastman?

34:23.884 --> 34:26.724
The girl was out to make amends.
Hmm?

34:26.724 --> 34:29.364
You think she was trying
to make amends for Beck's suicide?

34:30.444 --> 34:32.004
She was young.

34:32.004 --> 34:33.844
New to the job.

34:33.844 --> 34:36.884
And something like that's
bound to make an impression on her.

34:41.043 --> 34:42.484
You coming?

34:44.844 --> 34:47.043
Simon Beck was a...

34:47.043 --> 34:50.643
hard one to take.
His suicide was unexpected.

34:50.643 --> 34:54.724
He was one of Joanne's cases?
She evaluated him for parole.

34:54.724 --> 34:57.004
How did Joanne take his suicide?

34:57.964 --> 35:00.164
It's hard when someone
you've been working with

35:00.164 --> 35:02.444
decides there's no hope left.

35:02.444 --> 35:05.804
Did she talk to you about it,
tell you how she's feeling?

35:05.804 --> 35:07.684
We spoke after the fact, but...

35:07.684 --> 35:10.644
to be honest,
she seemed to be coping.

35:10.644 --> 35:12.764
Matthew, you need to sign off

35:12.764 --> 35:15.124
on the McKinley evaluation.
Yes, excuse me.

35:17.404 --> 35:21.244
Did you know she was looking
into Beck's conviction?

35:22.804 --> 35:24.484
What do you mean, "looking into it"?

35:24.484 --> 35:27.484
She was trying to overturn it.
Working with his sister.

35:27.484 --> 35:29.244
She was working with Ashleigh Beck?

35:29.244 --> 35:31.244
You know Ashleigh?

35:32.364 --> 35:36.044
I know she's been trying to get her
brother's case reopened for years.

35:37.404 --> 35:41.804
Now, we've been led to believe that
Beck told Joanne he was innocent.

35:43.764 --> 35:45.724
But she never told you that either?

35:45.724 --> 35:47.724
No. She didn't.

35:48.844 --> 35:52.284
I'm sorry, but I had no idea
about any of this.

35:52.284 --> 35:54.644
You think that was the reason
Joanne was killed?

35:54.644 --> 35:57.444
The Beck case?
It's one line of inquiry.

35:59.684 --> 36:02.924
Simon Beck. 37 years old.

36:02.924 --> 36:06.964
Serving a life sentence for murder
at HMP Scanton.

36:06.964 --> 36:11.604
Now, we know Joanne
was assessing Beck for parole,

36:11.604 --> 36:15.444
and when that parole was denied,
he took his own life.

36:15.444 --> 36:17.924
Now, that was four weeks ago

36:17.924 --> 36:20.764
and it looks like Joanne was upset
by his death

36:20.764 --> 36:23.764
and maybe...
even felt partly responsible

36:23.764 --> 36:28.164
because we know she started
looking into his case.

36:28.164 --> 36:31.124
Now, Archive have sent up
Beck's files.

36:31.124 --> 36:34.364
I want you to go through them
and see if you can identify anyone

36:34.364 --> 36:36.044
she might have spoken to.

36:36.044 --> 36:38.084
Because, according to his sister,

36:38.084 --> 36:42.604
Joanne was looking for new evidence
regarding the Jordan Payne case

36:42.604 --> 36:45.204
and maybe that
is what got her killed.

36:45.204 --> 36:46.644
So, come on.

36:46.644 --> 36:49.484
Ma'am, you might want to talk
to a woman called Natalie Webb.

36:49.484 --> 36:50.764
Who?

36:50.764 --> 36:53.844
Joanne had sent Natalie a number
of emails from a personal account.

36:53.844 --> 36:55.324
What were the emails about?

36:55.324 --> 36:58.084
Asking to get her husband
to go on record.

36:58.084 --> 37:00.444
And who's her husband?
Kieran Webb.

37:00.444 --> 37:02.644
He was a team-mate of Jordan's
around the time he died.

37:05.644 --> 37:07.964
My, news travels fast.

37:07.964 --> 37:10.564
I can't believe she's dead.
It's awful.

37:10.564 --> 37:13.724
Did you know Joanne well?
No.

37:13.724 --> 37:15.644
Apart from the emails,
we only spoke the once,

37:15.644 --> 37:17.684
when she come round the flat
looking for Kieran.

37:17.684 --> 37:20.244
He wasn't in
so she started asking us questions

37:20.244 --> 37:21.724
about that Jordan Payne lad.

37:23.364 --> 37:26.404
So, what did you tell her?
Nothing, really.

37:26.404 --> 37:28.964
I wasn't here when it happened.
I grew up in Jarrow.

37:28.964 --> 37:32.524
Anyway, she was dead keen
to talk to Kieran about it.

37:32.524 --> 37:34.604
That's when she started emailing,

37:34.604 --> 37:36.964
trying to get me to persuade him
to talk with her.

37:36.964 --> 37:40.444
And did Kieran talk with her?
Yeah. Yeah, last week.

37:42.044 --> 37:44.364
I don't think he told her anything
she didn't already know.

37:44.364 --> 37:46.724
He probably didn't tell her
anything, knowing Kieran.

37:46.724 --> 37:48.924
Daddy's the strong, silent type,
isn't he, Ryan?

37:48.924 --> 37:50.204
Daddy's the strong, silent type,
He doesn't say much.

37:51.404 --> 37:55.804
So, where can we find Kieran?
Well, that's him over there.

37:55.804 --> 37:58.684
The coach.
Yeah, go and have a chat with him.

38:00.084 --> 38:03.604
Yeah, I spoke to her.
About Jordan Payne's murder?

38:03.604 --> 38:05.484
She wanted to know
what I remembered.

38:06.484 --> 38:08.044
And what do you remember?

38:08.044 --> 38:10.404
Nothing much.
It was a long time ago.

38:12.844 --> 38:16.564
It seems, before she died,
she was looking for new evidence.

38:16.564 --> 38:19.004
She didn't get any from me.
Then, what did she get?

38:19.964 --> 38:21.164
Hmm?

38:22.804 --> 38:24.604
Oh, look, come on, Kieran.

38:24.604 --> 38:27.364
We don't wanna have to do this
down at the station.

38:31.364 --> 38:33.204
The day that Jordan was murdered,

38:33.204 --> 38:35.564
I saw Frank Payne
going into Crowley Wood.

38:36.804 --> 38:39.004
As in Jordan's dad?
Yeah.

38:39.004 --> 38:41.204
I was on my way home
when I saw him going in, but...

38:42.564 --> 38:44.044
..he looked pretty angry.

38:44.044 --> 38:46.964
You didn't report this at the time?
Course I did.

38:46.964 --> 38:49.044
I told one of your lot
when they came to interview me.

38:50.564 --> 38:53.244
Did they follow it up?
I guess there was no need to.

38:53.244 --> 38:55.084
Two days later,
I came home from school

38:55.084 --> 38:57.084
to find out that Beck had confessed.

38:59.324 --> 39:01.884
Did you tell Joanne this?
Yeah.

39:01.884 --> 39:03.244
How did she react?

39:03.244 --> 39:05.644
She must have thought
it was something.

39:05.644 --> 39:08.484
I mean, she marched straight
round the corner to Frank's house.

39:08.484 --> 39:10.764
She confronted Frank Payne?

39:10.764 --> 39:12.684
Yeah, managed to get him
all riled up.

39:14.044 --> 39:15.684
Thanks, Kieran.

39:47.124 --> 39:48.884
Mr Payne?

39:57.164 --> 39:59.884
Is your wife not about, Mr Payne?

39:59.884 --> 40:04.284
She passed. Two years now.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

40:05.684 --> 40:07.564
You want to tell me
what this is all about?

40:09.124 --> 40:11.004
Joanne Caswell.

40:11.004 --> 40:14.364
Did you know her?
I heard she's dead.

40:15.924 --> 40:17.964
We understand, before she died,

40:17.964 --> 40:19.804
she was looking
into your son's murder.

40:19.804 --> 40:22.484
She was meddling. Bloody do-gooders.

40:22.484 --> 40:24.644
You don't like people who do good?

40:24.644 --> 40:28.644
Not when they're trying to clear
the name of my son's murderer.

40:29.644 --> 40:32.804
So, you did have contact with her,
then? She came around.

40:35.244 --> 40:37.644
And did she ask you...

40:37.644 --> 40:41.804
what you were doing on the day
Jordan died? Now, look here.

40:41.804 --> 40:44.444
The girl's dead
and I feel sorry for her parents

40:44.444 --> 40:47.084
cos I know what it feels like
to lose a kid.

40:48.164 --> 40:49.924
But she was trying to slur my name.

40:49.924 --> 40:52.764
Important to you, is it, that?
Your name?

40:54.004 --> 40:55.804
It's all I've got left, son.

40:57.524 --> 40:59.004
So, what did you tell her?

41:00.364 --> 41:01.924
You wanna know what I told her?
Mm.

41:01.924 --> 41:05.684
I told her about how I came home
from work to find my son missing.

41:05.684 --> 41:07.244
I told her I went out
to look for him.

41:07.244 --> 41:10.164
Three full hours, I searched.
The whole bloody estate.

41:10.164 --> 41:13.484
Then I told her how I came back
to find some copper sitting there,

41:13.484 --> 41:16.444
telling my wife
they'd found his body in the woods.

41:17.644 --> 41:20.884
I didn't kill my son. I loved him.

41:22.164 --> 41:24.124
Where were you two nights ago?

41:24.124 --> 41:26.044
I was here, all night.

41:26.044 --> 41:28.564
On your own, Frank?

41:28.564 --> 41:30.324
What do you think?

41:33.204 --> 41:34.524
He's bitter.

41:36.124 --> 41:38.004
I suppose he's got a good reason
to be.

41:38.004 --> 41:40.604
Aye, well, getting drunk
at ten o'clock in the morning's

41:40.604 --> 41:42.644
not gonna help.
Hey?

41:42.644 --> 41:44.804
Well, what do you think
was in that mug?

41:56.924 --> 41:58.564
Here you go.

42:00.324 --> 42:02.524
I think we should look
at Frank Payne,

42:02.524 --> 42:05.524
especially if he was in the woods
the night his son was killed.

42:05.524 --> 42:08.324
They would've checked Frank out.
Aye, you'd have thought.

42:08.324 --> 42:13.284
In fact, Kenny, who was the lead
investigator on the Beck case?

42:13.284 --> 42:16.484
Er, Jim Paisley.
He's retired now, though.

42:16.484 --> 42:19.684
Ah, well, I wanna speak to him.
OK.

42:19.684 --> 42:22.964
Ma'am. I've been going over
Melanie Kirk's statement.

42:22.964 --> 42:24.724
I just wanted to check something.
What?

42:24.724 --> 42:27.604
Well, she says she's been in London
since Monday, right?

42:27.604 --> 42:29.404
Came back yesterday afternoon.

42:29.404 --> 42:31.804
Yeah, well, how did she do that?
Train!

42:31.804 --> 42:34.164
Well, there was a points failure
at Darlington yesterday.

42:34.164 --> 42:35.724
The East Coast Line
was out of action.

42:35.724 --> 42:38.604
Earliest she could have got back
was around nine last night.

42:38.604 --> 42:41.324
What about other routes?
Yeah, well, I checked the airports.

42:41.324 --> 42:42.644
She didn't get on any flights.

42:42.644 --> 42:45.204
There was one other route
on the West Coast.

42:45.204 --> 42:46.964
But even then,
the timings don't work.

42:46.964 --> 42:48.924
So, what are you saying,
she wasn't in London?

42:48.924 --> 42:51.364
No, I'm saying she wasn't in London
yesterday morning.

42:53.124 --> 42:55.044
Well, well, well...

43:04.839 --> 43:06.479
Dad, please...

43:06.479 --> 43:08.079
No. There's no need.

43:09.199 --> 43:10.839
Because I don't want to!

43:12.519 --> 43:13.879
Dad, I have to go.

43:16.159 --> 43:17.359
Sorry.

43:21.079 --> 43:23.079
Is everything OK?

43:26.199 --> 43:29.399
So, why didn't you tell us?
I didn't think it was important.

43:29.399 --> 43:32.479
You didn't think it was important
to tell us where you were?

43:32.479 --> 43:34.239
Well, I was actually in London.

43:34.239 --> 43:35.879
I just came back a day early,
that's all.

43:35.879 --> 43:39.319
Which means you were in Newcastle at
the time that Joanne was murdered.

43:39.319 --> 43:41.119
So, why did you come back early?

43:42.119 --> 43:45.319
Joanne had called the night before.
She left a message.

43:45.319 --> 43:47.719
She said she didn't want us
to be together any more.

43:47.719 --> 43:50.919
She broke up with you?
I couldn't understand it.

43:50.919 --> 43:54.639
We were so good together.
At least, I thought we were.

43:54.639 --> 43:58.639
So, these calls you made,
you weren't just checking up on her.

43:58.639 --> 44:00.999
I needed to talk to her,
find out why,

44:00.999 --> 44:03.679
what I did wrong.
She wouldn't even discuss it.

44:04.799 --> 44:07.199
So, you came back home. Then what?

44:08.399 --> 44:12.239
I couldn't find Joanne,
so I went to the flat...

44:12.239 --> 44:15.239
and waited.
But she never showed up.

44:15.239 --> 44:19.439
After a few hours,
I needed to get out, so I came here,

44:19.439 --> 44:22.759
drank two bottles of wine
and fell asleep.

44:22.759 --> 44:26.559
You stayed here at the gallery
overnight? Crashed out drunk.

44:26.559 --> 44:28.719
Woke up. Charged my phone.

44:28.719 --> 44:31.559
Seen I had about 20 messages
from you lot.

44:31.559 --> 44:34.159
Then I called you back.

44:41.199 --> 44:42.479
I'm sorry.

44:43.799 --> 44:45.359
I should've said.

44:46.359 --> 44:48.519
Such a shock, I didn't think.

44:52.599 --> 44:54.759
Can anyone vouch for you?

44:57.039 --> 44:58.759
The joiner worked late.

44:58.759 --> 45:02.479
He was here till about ten,
sorting out some snags.

45:02.479 --> 45:04.079
What about after that?

45:06.519 --> 45:07.999
It was just me.

45:17.679 --> 45:21.399
Joiner confirms, Melanie was
at the gallery when he left at ten.

45:23.399 --> 45:24.799
Did he say anything else?

45:24.799 --> 45:28.439
Well, he said she seemed upset,
which chimed with her story.

45:28.439 --> 45:30.279
I wanna know why she lied.

45:30.279 --> 45:32.959
Well, she didn't exactly lie.
She just didn't tell us everything.

45:32.959 --> 45:35.519
She'd lost her girlfriend.
She was in shock.

45:35.519 --> 45:38.119
Well, she had every opportunity
to tell us the truth

45:38.119 --> 45:39.839
and she chose not to.

45:40.919 --> 45:44.239
Mark, did you find anything
on the girlfriend's background?

45:44.239 --> 45:45.999
Nothing that stood out.

45:45.999 --> 45:48.759
She's got money.
Well, at least her family has.

45:48.759 --> 45:51.119
They put up the cash
for the art gallery.

45:51.119 --> 45:53.719
Right, so she's well off.
Anything else?

45:53.719 --> 45:56.279
Bit of trouble in university.

45:56.279 --> 45:57.999
What?

45:57.999 --> 46:00.639
Seems she had to leave
under a cloud.

46:00.639 --> 46:03.839
What sort of cloud?
I don't know the details.

46:04.839 --> 46:07.879
Well, you let me know the second
you do, Jac. Keep looking.

46:07.879 --> 46:11.799
Kenny, tell me you've got something
on those tyre tracks.

46:11.799 --> 46:13.959
Good news and bad news, boss.

46:13.959 --> 46:15.879
the good news is
we've identified the brand.

46:15.879 --> 46:18.439
Oh, don't tell me.
Common brand, right?

46:18.439 --> 46:21.159
Yeah, half the cars in the car park
will be sporting the same tyres.

46:22.239 --> 46:25.159
But I did manage to track down
Jim Paisley. And?

46:25.159 --> 46:27.439
And he's happy to talk.

46:27.439 --> 46:28.799
Address.

46:39.759 --> 46:42.599
It was the wife's idea.

46:42.599 --> 46:46.719
Legacy wall, she calls it.
Well, you've had quite the career.

46:47.719 --> 46:50.119
Thanks.
Had its moment, I suppose.

46:51.159 --> 46:52.759
So, how can I help you?

46:52.759 --> 46:56.239
Oh, it's, er,
an old case of yours, Jim.

46:56.239 --> 46:59.679
This fella. Simon Beck.

46:59.679 --> 47:03.319
It's come up as part of an
investigation we're working on.

47:05.279 --> 47:08.559
The Caswell girl. Very sad.

47:08.559 --> 47:10.439
Did you know her, then?

47:11.639 --> 47:14.279
About two weeks ago,
she turned up at the door.

47:15.799 --> 47:18.479
And, like you, she was looking
for background on the case.

47:20.279 --> 47:21.479
So, what you tell her?

47:22.919 --> 47:24.679
As much as I could.

47:24.679 --> 47:27.599
The case itself
was straightforward.

47:27.599 --> 47:30.559
We had a witness who saw Beck
near the crime scene.

47:30.559 --> 47:33.039
We brought him in for questioning
and he confessed.

47:35.999 --> 47:38.479
Did he say why he killed him?

47:40.119 --> 47:43.279
Apparently, Beck had dropped Jordan
from the team,

47:43.279 --> 47:45.199
the lad didn't take it too well.

47:45.199 --> 47:48.639
They argued after a training session
and Beck flipped.

47:48.639 --> 47:51.279
Well, didn't that strike you as odd?

47:52.479 --> 47:55.879
I mean, Beck had no history
of violence.

47:58.239 --> 47:59.839
It did bother me, yeah.

47:59.839 --> 48:03.799
But, then, as you know,
sometimes people snap.

48:05.439 --> 48:06.959
Did you ever look at anyone else?

48:08.359 --> 48:09.679
You mean like Frank Payne?

48:09.679 --> 48:12.799
Well, now, we have a witness,
Kieran Webb.

48:12.799 --> 48:15.799
Said he saw Frank Payne
going into Crowley Woods

48:15.799 --> 48:18.279
around the time of the murder.
We followed that up.

48:18.279 --> 48:20.039
Frank said he was out
looking for Jordan.

48:20.039 --> 48:22.399
What, and that was good enough
for you, was it?

48:22.399 --> 48:24.559
What, and that was good enough
Normally, no.

48:25.519 --> 48:28.479
But by that time,
Beck had confessed to the murder.

48:29.719 --> 48:33.759
Well, apparently,
Beck told Joanne he was innocent.

48:33.759 --> 48:36.199
Did you know that?
She mentioned it.

48:36.199 --> 48:38.959
What do you think about that?

48:38.959 --> 48:42.079
To be honest, I were disappointed.

48:42.079 --> 48:43.799
The thing I remember about Beck

48:43.799 --> 48:46.239
is he had the courage to own up
to his crime.

48:46.239 --> 48:47.559
I respected him for that.

48:47.559 --> 48:51.479
I never thought he'd be the type
to start pretending he was innocent.

48:54.319 --> 48:58.639
A young lad being killed like that.
You never get use to them.

48:58.639 --> 49:03.039
Ah, well, it can't have been easy.
A case like that.

49:03.039 --> 49:06.039
A lad murdered not a mile
from his home.

49:07.039 --> 49:08.799
That's a lot of pressure.

49:08.799 --> 49:10.919
I'm first to admit I got lucky.

49:37.239 --> 49:40.439
Now, Jim Paisley,
he's worried about something.

49:40.439 --> 49:42.399
Like what?
I don't know.

49:42.399 --> 49:45.519
But I want us to take a look
at Beck's interview tape.

49:45.519 --> 49:47.479
Can you get hold of it?
Yeah, I'll do my best.

49:47.479 --> 49:50.079
Do you think there's something dodgy
about the confession?

49:50.079 --> 49:52.599
Oh, Paisley's holding
something back.

49:52.599 --> 49:55.759
And he certainly doesn't want us
looking into this case,

49:55.759 --> 49:59.119
worried about
his bloody legacy wall.

49:59.119 --> 50:02.319
'It'll be a lot easier
if you just come clean, Simon.

50:02.319 --> 50:03.879
'We know you were with Jordan.

50:03.879 --> 50:06.279
'We know you argued...
I'm responsible.

50:08.279 --> 50:11.079
'What was that, Simon?
'I said, I'm responsible.

50:11.079 --> 50:14.439
'Are you saying you killed Jordan?

50:15.799 --> 50:18.199
'Well, Simon, this is your chance.
Tell us what happened.

50:18.199 --> 50:20.079
'Give your side.
'I did it.

50:21.679 --> 50:24.679
'I'm not saying any more.
I don't wanna talk any more.'

50:24.679 --> 50:27.439
Well, Paisley's not subtle,
but he's got the confession.

50:27.439 --> 50:29.839
'Interview suspended at 14.22.'
Did he?

50:29.839 --> 50:32.879
The interview lasted 20 minutes.
Beck couldn't wait to confess.

50:32.879 --> 50:34.959
He said he was responsible.

50:36.239 --> 50:37.959
OK, fine, but...

50:37.959 --> 50:40.799
why would Beck admit to murder
if he didn't do it?

50:40.799 --> 50:43.239
I don't know.
But if he was innocent,

50:43.239 --> 50:45.759
and Paisley did get it wrong,

50:45.759 --> 50:48.799
then, Jordan's killer
is still out there.

50:49.879 --> 50:53.839
Mark, where are we
on Joanne's movements?

50:53.839 --> 50:56.639
We've got her leaving the Lorsica
at 15:10

50:56.639 --> 50:58.079
and then nothing after that.

50:58.079 --> 51:00.439
Yeah, but uniform
did just send this over.

51:00.439 --> 51:02.799
Incident report
from the night of the murder.

51:02.799 --> 51:07.719
Uniform were called out at 9:48pm
to a shout on Orr Drive.

51:07.719 --> 51:10.759
Orr Drive?
That's the Caswell's address.

51:10.759 --> 51:13.639
Yeah, some drunk bloke
hanging around acting suspicious.

51:13.639 --> 51:15.279
They cautioned him
and moved him on.

51:15.279 --> 51:17.999
I hope they got a name.
Aye, they did.

51:17.999 --> 51:19.519
Frank Payne.

51:23.239 --> 51:26.279
You've got no right coming round
here and harassing me like this.

51:26.279 --> 51:27.999
We're just asking you a question.

51:27.999 --> 51:31.279
What were you doing outside
the Caswell home?

51:31.279 --> 51:33.999
I wasn't. I told you. I was here.

51:33.999 --> 51:38.999
DS Healy, call the officer who spoke
to him and get him over here now!

51:38.999 --> 51:41.039
He'll soon confirm it.

51:46.759 --> 51:49.119
All right. All right.

51:50.919 --> 51:52.679
HE HANGS UP

51:52.679 --> 51:55.599
I just wanted her to stop.
Stop what?

51:57.319 --> 51:59.039
That girl was out to ruin my life.

52:00.239 --> 52:02.439
Talking about going to the police
and the papers.

52:02.439 --> 52:04.879
Telling them I was a suspect
in my own son's murder.

52:04.879 --> 52:08.399
So, you went to her house.
Now, what was your plan, Frank?

52:08.399 --> 52:11.159
Nothing. There was no plan.

52:11.159 --> 52:14.359
I'd had a skinful.
I don't even remember.

52:14.359 --> 52:16.039
Did you confront her?

52:16.039 --> 52:17.399
No.

52:18.559 --> 52:19.759
She never showed up.

52:19.759 --> 52:22.759
Ah, now,
how do you know that, Frank,

52:22.759 --> 52:25.079
if you don't remember, hmm?

52:39.319 --> 52:43.919
SLOWLY: Did you see her that night?

52:46.759 --> 52:48.359
The truth is...

52:50.159 --> 52:52.039
..I don't know.

53:11.239 --> 53:13.039
Where are you going?
Come on.

53:14.399 --> 53:18.439
Everywhere we turn,
we run into the Jordan Payne case.

53:19.599 --> 53:24.279
I wanna get a sense of the lad,
starting with where he died.

53:27.639 --> 53:29.919
Frank may have had a motive
to kill Joanne,

53:29.919 --> 53:32.439
but is he really capable?
Oh, he's angry.

53:32.439 --> 53:34.119
You heard what he said.

53:34.119 --> 53:35.759
She was a threat to him,

53:35.759 --> 53:38.359
implicating him in the murder
of his own son.

53:38.359 --> 53:40.479
She had a sighting of him
near the crime scene,

53:40.479 --> 53:44.079
hardly a smoking gun. Yeah, well,
who's to say that's all she had?

53:44.079 --> 53:46.079
Maybe she found something else.

53:46.079 --> 53:49.799
Nah, I can't see him killing her.
No matter how angry he gets.

53:54.119 --> 53:55.999
Boss?

54:03.199 --> 54:07.639
Call Forensics.
I want a team here within the hour.

54:08.839 --> 54:11.559
This is where Joanne Caswell
was killed.

54:19.084 --> 54:20.524
This is just what we need,
thank you.

54:20.524 --> 54:22.564
It was just there.
Great. Here's the lanyard.

54:22.564 --> 54:25.404
Let me know if you find
anything else. All right. Thanks.

54:42.884 --> 54:45.364
So, they're taking samples
of the paint from the trees

54:45.364 --> 54:47.284
and they found this by the outcrop.

54:48.284 --> 54:50.324
Joanne Caswell's work ID.

54:53.684 --> 54:56.124
Did they find anything else?
Nothing we can use.

54:56.124 --> 54:58.964
They'll keep looking,
but the crime scene's four days old.

54:58.964 --> 55:00.884
Aye, and it was raining last night.

55:04.404 --> 55:07.404
It cannot be a coincidence.

55:07.404 --> 55:10.204
Her dying in the same place
as that lad.

55:12.124 --> 55:16.004
Now, then, Joanne Casswell
was murdered in Crowley Woods.

55:16.004 --> 55:19.804
So, from now on, we concentrate
our attention on this area.

55:19.804 --> 55:21.884
Now, Mark, timeline.

55:21.884 --> 55:24.564
The last known sighting of Joanne
was leaving the Lorsica,

55:24.564 --> 55:27.604
in the city. So,
how did she get to Crowley Woods?

55:27.604 --> 55:30.764
Did she get there under her own
steam or did someone take her?

55:30.764 --> 55:33.924
And how did her killer get her
from those woods

55:33.924 --> 55:35.444
to this landfill site?

55:35.444 --> 55:38.884
Now, the more observant amongst you
will have noticed

55:38.884 --> 55:44.244
that Joanne was killed not 50 yards
from where Jordan died.

55:44.244 --> 55:46.724
So, what's the connection
between these two deaths?

55:46.724 --> 55:48.644
And now, the good news.

55:48.644 --> 55:51.604
I want you to go through
those files again.

55:51.604 --> 55:57.124
We need to know every detail
of that original Beck case.

55:57.124 --> 55:59.124
Now, I'm going to see Paisley.

56:02.644 --> 56:04.404
Ma'am, before you go...

56:04.404 --> 56:07.644
I found out why Melanie Kirk
left university. Why?

56:07.644 --> 56:10.004
Well, it turns out
she had some trouble with a tutor.

56:10.004 --> 56:12.404
A Laura Powell.
What sort of trouble?

56:12.404 --> 56:15.564
Oh, Melanie developed a bit of
a crush on Laura in her first year.

56:15.564 --> 56:17.924
Harmless at first,
but then things escalated.

56:17.924 --> 56:20.964
Melanie soon became a problem.

56:20.964 --> 56:25.084
Calls, text messages, she even broke
into Laura's flat one night.

56:25.084 --> 56:29.004
Did she ever get violent?
No, but she did threaten Laura.

56:31.644 --> 56:34.684
Do you want me to bring Melanie in?
No, not yet.

56:35.684 --> 56:37.484
Check out the CCTV at the gallery.

56:37.484 --> 56:39.924
Make sure she was there
the night she said she was.

56:40.924 --> 56:44.324
Oh, and, Jac... get Kenny
to go through her bank records

56:44.324 --> 56:46.924
and mark any payments
from her parents. Right.

57:00.444 --> 57:05.604
How'd you find me? Ah, your missus
told me where you were

57:05.604 --> 57:08.484
and she says you're not to be late
for your dinner.

57:11.684 --> 57:15.564
Joanne was killed not 50 yards
from where Jordan died.

57:15.564 --> 57:20.124
So, you think there's a connection?
Well, wouldn't you?

57:20.124 --> 57:23.324
A girl looking into an old murder
ends up killed herself

57:23.324 --> 57:25.484
in the same place
as the first victim.

57:25.484 --> 57:29.124
The same killer? That your theory?
No, I'm not saying that.

57:29.124 --> 57:30.964
But you think I got the wrong man.

57:30.964 --> 57:34.284
No, I just want to know
what makes you so sure

57:34.284 --> 57:36.444
it was Beck who killed him.

57:36.444 --> 57:38.844
I told you. The confession.

57:38.844 --> 57:41.924
Now, I've watched that confession,
Jim.

57:41.924 --> 57:44.204
And... I'm not convinced by it.

57:44.204 --> 57:46.564
Yeah? Well, the jury was.

57:48.084 --> 57:51.164
And then there's Beck's motive.
Hmm?

57:51.164 --> 57:55.284
Snapping over a row about dropping
Jordan from the team?

57:55.284 --> 57:58.084
He'd been coaching them for years.

57:58.084 --> 58:01.004
He was used to those lads moaning
all the time.

58:01.004 --> 58:04.124
So, what made Jordan Payne
so different?

58:04.124 --> 58:08.564
Oh, you're looking for holes now.
Aye. Didn't you look for holes?

58:08.564 --> 58:12.484
Look, Jim, I'm just...
I'm just trying to understand.

58:12.484 --> 58:15.484
Because there's something
about this...

58:15.484 --> 58:17.204
I mean, it just doesn't sit right.

58:17.204 --> 58:19.484
He was abusing the lad!

58:21.244 --> 58:22.764
What?
You're right.

58:22.764 --> 58:25.604
The motive was weak.
It was nothing to do with football.

58:26.604 --> 58:30.084
Where's this come from?
There were rumours in Crowley.

58:31.084 --> 58:32.404
Did you follow them up?

58:33.924 --> 58:38.644
And why's none of this in the files?
I only found out after the fact.

58:38.644 --> 58:40.284
How'd you find out?

58:42.924 --> 58:46.524
One of my squad must've picked it up
from one of their informants...

58:46.524 --> 58:48.244
And so, did you check it out?

58:48.244 --> 58:50.644
The Payne family
had been through enough.

58:50.644 --> 58:52.044
They didn't need to know...

58:52.044 --> 58:55.004
This is nothing to do
with the Payne family.

58:56.684 --> 58:58.844
I stand by my decision.

58:58.844 --> 59:01.724
Yeah, well,
it wasn't your decision to make!

59:09.364 --> 59:11.564
I'll go through
the files again,

59:11.564 --> 59:13.604
but I'm certain
there was no mention of abuse.

59:13.604 --> 59:16.004
OK, while you do that,
I'm going to find out

59:16.004 --> 59:18.084
if there's any truth
to these rumours.

59:33.084 --> 59:36.124
Oh. Well, look, could I have
a quick word, Mr Webb?

59:36.124 --> 59:39.724
Kieran.
We're just about to go to my mum's.

59:39.724 --> 59:41.724
Oh, it won't take long, Natalie.

59:43.084 --> 59:45.844
You're kidding?
Jordan was an absolute lad.

59:45.844 --> 59:48.484
Yeah, well, that doesn't mean
anything. Even so.

59:49.604 --> 59:50.804
There's no way.

59:51.884 --> 59:55.284
Are you sure
Jordan never mentioned him?

59:55.284 --> 59:58.324
Never even talked about Beck?

59:58.324 --> 59:59.564
the thing about Jordan...

01:00:00.644 --> 01:00:04.444
..is, when he died,
people had him down as this angel.

01:00:04.444 --> 01:00:06.204
And that wasn't the case?

01:00:07.284 --> 01:00:08.804
He wasn't bad, but...

01:00:09.804 --> 01:00:11.604
..he was streetwise.

01:00:11.604 --> 01:00:14.364
Beck would have had to have been
stupid to try it on with him.

01:00:17.244 --> 01:00:19.684
What was your impression of Beck?

01:00:19.684 --> 01:00:22.844
He seemed all right.
He was a half-decent coach.

01:00:25.884 --> 01:00:27.444
When it happened, we were shocked.

01:00:28.484 --> 01:00:31.844
All of us.
The team, it folded after that.

01:00:31.844 --> 01:00:35.164
Hmm...
It's revived now, that's good.

01:00:35.164 --> 01:00:37.164
It keeps me fit.

01:00:37.164 --> 01:00:39.564
Gets me a break from Natalie.

01:00:42.644 --> 01:00:45.684
Ma'am.
Hang on, Kenny.

01:00:45.684 --> 01:00:48.244
Kieran Webb said
he never heard anything

01:00:48.244 --> 01:00:49.924
about Beck and Jordan Payne.

01:00:49.924 --> 01:00:52.804
Yeah, well,
Trevor Dyer heard about it. Who?

01:00:52.804 --> 01:00:54.844
The other detective
in the Beck interview.

01:00:54.844 --> 01:00:57.284
He heard it from Paisley
a week ago.

01:00:57.284 --> 01:01:00.204
What? Yeah, he says that Paisley
took him out for some drinks.

01:01:00.204 --> 01:01:02.364
Then, out of nowhere,
dropped it in the conversation.

01:01:02.364 --> 01:01:04.644
What's Paisley playing at?

01:01:04.644 --> 01:01:07.244
Ma'am... Trevor,
he reckons that he's scared,

01:01:07.244 --> 01:01:08.884
worried they're gonna
reopen the case.

01:01:08.884 --> 01:01:12.524
What, and he's making sure we're all
singing from the same hymn sheet.

01:01:12.524 --> 01:01:15.244
Did this fella say
who had told Paisley?

01:01:15.244 --> 01:01:17.924
Paisley didn't say.
Melanie Kirk, ma'am.

01:01:17.924 --> 01:01:19.924
I've just being going through
her bank record.

01:01:19.924 --> 01:01:24.324
She did use her debit card.
And it was, er, at 10:49 that night.

01:01:24.324 --> 01:01:26.604
Are you saying
she left the gallery?

01:01:26.604 --> 01:01:28.804
She bought a train ticket
from a self-service machine

01:01:28.804 --> 01:01:31.164
at Selburn Station.
Did you catch her on CCTV?

01:01:31.164 --> 01:01:33.724
Well, never mind all that.
Where was she travelling to?

01:01:33.724 --> 01:01:36.444
Well, we don't know.
She just bought a ticket for £5.80.

01:01:36.444 --> 01:01:39.764
Yeah, well, how much is a ticket
from Selburn to Crowley? Erm...

01:01:42.724 --> 01:01:43.924
£5.80.

01:01:56.524 --> 01:01:58.364
The first time,

01:01:58.364 --> 01:02:01.364
when you didn't tell us
you came back from London early,

01:02:01.364 --> 01:02:04.284
I gave you the benefit of the doubt.

01:02:04.284 --> 01:02:05.724
But not this time, Melanie.

01:02:06.764 --> 01:02:08.724
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

01:02:08.724 --> 01:02:12.724
I know you left the gallery
the night Joanne was killed.

01:02:14.324 --> 01:02:16.084
There's a reason I didn't tell you.

01:02:18.524 --> 01:02:21.444
Because it didn't matter.
It didn't matter?

01:02:21.444 --> 01:02:26.164
You gave us a false alibi, Melanie.
You lied to us.

01:02:28.004 --> 01:02:31.404
OK. I went out.
But I didn't see Joanne.

01:02:32.764 --> 01:02:35.804
And I'd never hurt her.
In fact, I'd never hurt anyone.

01:02:35.804 --> 01:02:37.324
No.

01:02:37.324 --> 01:02:39.324
What about Laura Powell?

01:02:40.724 --> 01:02:43.204
I didn't hurt Laura either.
No, but you threatened to.

01:02:43.204 --> 01:02:45.204
You broke into her flat.

01:02:45.204 --> 01:02:46.764
I made a mistake.

01:02:46.764 --> 01:02:49.324
I was feeling things
too intensely back then.

01:02:50.444 --> 01:02:52.244
Look, I got help.

01:02:52.244 --> 01:02:54.924
I realised I fixated on Laura

01:02:54.924 --> 01:02:56.724
and didn't cope
when she rejected me.

01:02:56.724 --> 01:03:01.444
So, what about Joanne?
She rejected you, just like Laura.

01:03:01.444 --> 01:03:05.564
That's not the same.
Joanne and I were in a relationship.

01:03:05.564 --> 01:03:09.244
Which she ended the day she died.

01:03:10.564 --> 01:03:12.084
Coincidence or what?

01:03:15.364 --> 01:03:18.644
So, where'd you go?
Nowhere.

01:03:18.644 --> 01:03:19.924
Hmm?

01:03:21.084 --> 01:03:24.364
We know you took a train.
I didn't take a train.

01:03:24.364 --> 01:03:28.044
So, why buy a ticket?
To get through the barrier.

01:03:29.204 --> 01:03:32.564
Yes. I was devastated
when Joanne ended our relationship.

01:03:32.564 --> 01:03:34.084
I still am.

01:03:34.084 --> 01:03:36.684
And, yes, I rushed back here
to try and change her mind.

01:03:36.684 --> 01:03:40.164
I would have said or done
anything to keep her.

01:03:43.284 --> 01:03:46.724
The last...
call I made that night...

01:03:48.164 --> 01:03:50.644
..I was going to threaten
to do something stupid

01:03:50.644 --> 01:03:52.164
if she didn't come to me.

01:03:54.284 --> 01:03:57.084
So, I went to the station...

01:03:59.404 --> 01:04:01.404
..and I stood on the platform,

01:04:01.404 --> 01:04:04.524
and I wondered
what would happen if...

01:04:04.524 --> 01:04:07.964
..if I just stepped out.

01:04:10.364 --> 01:04:12.604
But I couldn't do it in the end.

01:04:14.844 --> 01:04:17.004
Why didn't you tell us this before?

01:04:17.004 --> 01:04:18.884
Isn't it obvious?

01:04:18.884 --> 01:04:20.564
I was ashamed.

01:04:24.884 --> 01:04:27.764
No. That's not the reason, is it?

01:04:28.804 --> 01:04:30.244
Hmm?

01:04:32.124 --> 01:04:33.364
You didn't tell us

01:04:33.364 --> 01:04:36.684
cos you didn't want your mum and dad
to know what you'd been planning.

01:04:38.084 --> 01:04:39.444
I mean, all this.

01:04:39.444 --> 01:04:41.204
The gallery.

01:04:41.204 --> 01:04:43.324
Your nice flat.

01:04:43.324 --> 01:04:46.564
That's all your mum and dad,
isn't it?

01:04:48.484 --> 01:04:50.764
So, what would have happened
if they knew...

01:04:50.764 --> 01:04:54.044
about how low you were feeling?

01:04:55.484 --> 01:04:58.604
Coming here was an experiment.

01:04:58.604 --> 01:05:03.164
A chance for me to prove to them
that I can live my own life.

01:05:04.444 --> 01:05:07.484
So, yes. If they knew,
all this would be gone.

01:05:08.724 --> 01:05:10.404
And they'd assume that I'd failed.

01:05:17.364 --> 01:05:20.284
Please, don't tell them.

01:05:24.804 --> 01:05:26.804
I checked with Selburn Station.

01:05:26.804 --> 01:05:30.484
CCTV confirms that Melanie was on
the platform till around midnight.

01:05:32.524 --> 01:05:36.444
Right. Get someone from Family
Liaison over to talk to her.

01:05:36.444 --> 01:05:37.724
MOBILE PHONE RINGS

01:05:37.724 --> 01:05:40.284
And I want someone with her
in that flat overnight.

01:05:40.284 --> 01:05:42.884
Jac?
I think I've found one.

01:05:42.884 --> 01:05:45.244
Found what?
A witness.

01:05:45.244 --> 01:05:47.124
Found what?
We're at Pizza Cortona, ma'am.

01:05:47.124 --> 01:05:49.884
Right, you stay there.
We're on our way.

01:05:49.884 --> 01:05:52.444
What?
Jac's found a witness.

01:06:06.604 --> 01:06:08.764
His name's Tarek Hamawi.

01:06:08.764 --> 01:06:10.644
He's a delivery driver
for this place.

01:06:10.644 --> 01:06:12.244
So, what's he witnessed?

01:06:12.244 --> 01:06:14.604
Says he saw a woman
matching Joanne's description

01:06:14.604 --> 01:06:16.444
running from a car
on the night of the murder.

01:06:16.444 --> 01:06:18.404
Can he give us a description
of the driver?

01:06:18.404 --> 01:06:20.764
He doesn't have to.
He's got a dash cam.

01:06:22.604 --> 01:06:25.244
Here we go.

01:06:27.164 --> 01:06:29.044
Well, there's our girl.

01:06:31.524 --> 01:06:33.564
What's she doing?

01:06:44.084 --> 01:06:47.164
And there's Matthew Wells.

01:07:02.364 --> 01:07:04.564
Is he in his office?
He's not here. Where is he?

01:07:04.564 --> 01:07:06.724
Is he in his office?
He's in court all day.

01:07:06.724 --> 01:07:11.204
You told me you had no idea Joanne
was looking into Beck's conviction.

01:07:11.204 --> 01:07:13.044
And we didn't.

01:07:13.044 --> 01:07:15.764
Ah, now, you see that
little hesitation there,

01:07:15.764 --> 01:07:18.044
that tells me she's lying.

01:07:18.044 --> 01:07:19.924
So, I'll ask you again.

01:07:19.924 --> 01:07:23.284
Did you know
she was looking into it?

01:07:23.284 --> 01:07:24.884
You have to understand,

01:07:24.884 --> 01:07:27.324
Matthew's been under
a lot of pressure lately.

01:07:27.324 --> 01:07:29.844
This job, it's not easy.

01:07:34.924 --> 01:07:37.364
Beck's suicide wasn't unexpected.

01:07:37.364 --> 01:07:39.524
Joanne considered him high-risk.

01:07:39.524 --> 01:07:41.644
So, why wasn't the man given help?

01:07:41.644 --> 01:07:44.164
Because Matthew thought
he was bluffing,

01:07:44.164 --> 01:07:46.204
trying to manipulate Joanne.

01:07:46.204 --> 01:07:47.924
And when he died?

01:07:49.284 --> 01:07:52.404
Joanne demanded Matthew
take full responsibility,

01:07:52.404 --> 01:07:55.644
which he couldn't do.
Why not?

01:07:59.244 --> 01:08:03.484
Beck... wasn't the first one
Matthew missed.

01:08:03.484 --> 01:08:05.684
There was another suicide
two months ago,

01:08:05.684 --> 01:08:08.164
one of the prisoner's
Matthew was working with.

01:08:09.284 --> 01:08:11.284
He could be struck off!

01:08:11.284 --> 01:08:16.163
So, when Joanne demanded he accept
culpability for Beck's suicide,

01:08:16.163 --> 01:08:18.243
what happened?

01:08:19.964 --> 01:08:21.203
Matthew threatened her.

01:08:38.044 --> 01:08:40.044
Ah, Mr Wells.

01:08:42.524 --> 01:08:45.124
Hello.
Excuse me, what are you doing?

01:08:45.124 --> 01:08:49.004
No, no. This is a mistake.
This is really a mistake. Please!

01:08:49.004 --> 01:08:51.644
OK, listen up, everyone.

01:08:51.644 --> 01:08:54.524
We now have Matthew Wells
with Joanne

01:08:54.524 --> 01:08:56.604
on the night
that she was killed.

01:08:56.604 --> 01:08:59.283
Kenny, I need Forensics
to go over his car

01:08:59.283 --> 01:09:01.964
so his tyres match those treads
up at the landfill.

01:09:01.964 --> 01:09:05.084
And, Jac, I wanna know where he was
before he got to Crowley.

01:09:05.084 --> 01:09:07.004
I can tell you where he wasn't.
Where?

01:09:07.004 --> 01:09:09.363
The hearing Wells was supposed
to be giving evidence at

01:09:09.363 --> 01:09:11.564
was postponed.
So, where was he?

01:09:11.564 --> 01:09:13.203
was postponed.
Well, according to ANPR,

01:09:13.203 --> 01:09:17.203
his car was in the city centre
at 2:30pm. Fulton Street.

01:09:18.203 --> 01:09:19.404
Fulton Street?

01:09:19.404 --> 01:09:22.524
That's just round the corner
from The Lorsica, isn't it?

01:09:22.524 --> 01:09:25.283
Yeah.
He was following her.

01:09:42.604 --> 01:09:44.044
I didn't kill her.

01:09:44.044 --> 01:09:47.283
No? No, you were with her
on the night she died.

01:09:47.283 --> 01:09:50.044
She was in your car.
That is the last I saw of her.

01:09:51.964 --> 01:09:54.124
Why would I murder Joanne?

01:09:54.124 --> 01:09:57.244
Well, for a start,
she was writing up a report

01:09:57.244 --> 01:10:00.164
saying that you dismissed
her concerns about Beck.

01:10:00.164 --> 01:10:01.644
That was a bad call.

01:10:01.644 --> 01:10:04.004
And how about threatening
to damage her career?

01:10:04.004 --> 01:10:06.004
Is that a bad call, too?
I shouldn't have done that.

01:10:06.004 --> 01:10:08.364
But there was no way
I was actually going to do it.

01:10:08.364 --> 01:10:11.004
But there was no way
Joanne was upset about Beck.

01:10:11.004 --> 01:10:12.684
And I understood that, but...

01:10:12.684 --> 01:10:15.964
I was trying to teach her that,
in this job,

01:10:15.964 --> 01:10:18.284
you can't take things personally.

01:10:18.284 --> 01:10:22.684
You weren't teaching her anything,
Mr Wells. You were scared.

01:10:22.684 --> 01:10:26.044
You'd already lost
one prisoner to suicide.

01:10:26.044 --> 01:10:27.404
Beck would've made it two!

01:10:27.404 --> 01:10:29.924
And if that came out,
you would have been finished.

01:10:29.924 --> 01:10:32.724
That's not true.
Were you following Joanne?

01:10:33.964 --> 01:10:36.284
It's just that we have your car
near the Lorsica Cafe

01:10:36.284 --> 01:10:38.124
on the day that she murdered.

01:10:38.124 --> 01:10:40.964
There you are,
just round the corner.

01:10:42.724 --> 01:10:46.764
No. I... intercepted her.

01:10:46.764 --> 01:10:48.924
That's a funny word for abduction.

01:10:48.924 --> 01:10:53.324
I didn't abduct Joanne.
She got into the car voluntarily.

01:10:54.204 --> 01:10:56.844
OK. I was worried.

01:10:57.964 --> 01:11:00.204
Joanne told me
she was handing in the report.

01:11:00.204 --> 01:11:03.404
So, you were following her.
I just wanted to talk to her,

01:11:03.404 --> 01:11:05.524
persuade her to change her mind.

01:11:06.964 --> 01:11:08.964
She was obsessed with Beck,

01:11:08.964 --> 01:11:12.604
saw him as some big miscarriage
of justice.

01:11:12.604 --> 01:11:16.284
Why'd you take her to Crowley?
She asked me to take her there.

01:11:16.284 --> 01:11:21.124
And on the way, I tried to tell her
a few home truths about Simon Beck.

01:11:21.124 --> 01:11:22.844
You told her about Beck and Jordan.

01:11:24.364 --> 01:11:26.204
Did Paisley put you up to that?

01:11:27.684 --> 01:11:31.164
Paisley came to me,
after Joanne spoke to him.

01:11:31.164 --> 01:11:34.844
He was worried that she'd find
some flaw in the conviction.

01:11:34.844 --> 01:11:36.444
So, you lied to her,

01:11:36.444 --> 01:11:38.884
filled her head
with this abuse story.

01:11:38.884 --> 01:11:40.964
I can prove he was guilty.

01:11:40.964 --> 01:11:42.444
Beck admitted it.

01:11:42.444 --> 01:11:44.644
I went back over everything
we had on him.

01:11:44.644 --> 01:11:48.164
15 years of sessions
and evaluations.

01:11:48.164 --> 01:11:50.084
And eventually, I found it.

01:11:50.084 --> 01:11:53.164
Found what?
Notes on a therapy session.

01:11:53.164 --> 01:11:56.004
The therapist pushes him
on why he killed Jordan.

01:11:56.004 --> 01:11:59.004
Beck eventually admits
he was in love with him

01:11:59.004 --> 01:12:01.084
and Jordan was going to expose him.

01:12:02.804 --> 01:12:06.484
The notes are back in the office.
Get them, if you don't believe me.

01:12:09.204 --> 01:12:13.444
So, how did she react when
you told her about Beck and Jordan?

01:12:15.164 --> 01:12:16.524
You can see for yourself.

01:12:17.924 --> 01:12:20.164
She got angry
and jumped out of the car.

01:12:21.964 --> 01:12:26.244
So, I went back to the office
and drafted my resignation.

01:12:36.524 --> 01:12:39.964
Well, whatever way you look at it,
you can't deny Wells has got motive.

01:12:39.964 --> 01:12:43.564
Kenny, have you got anything back
from Forensics?

01:12:43.564 --> 01:12:46.124
They're still processing the car.
Nothing yet.

01:12:46.124 --> 01:12:49.444
Oh, and the tyres don't match
the tracks up at Denford Hill.

01:12:49.444 --> 01:12:51.804
So, it wasn't his car
at the landfill.

01:12:51.804 --> 01:12:54.644
No. His car was being snapped
by a traffic camera,

01:12:54.644 --> 01:12:57.324
close to where he works.
Clocked at 10:20.

01:12:57.324 --> 01:13:00.724
Well, that'll be him going back
to write his resignation letter.

01:13:00.724 --> 01:13:03.724
OK. So, let's say
he's telling the truth

01:13:03.724 --> 01:13:06.244
and she just ran from the car.

01:13:06.244 --> 01:13:08.524
Where's she gonna run to?

01:13:08.524 --> 01:13:10.324
Maybe she was heading home.

01:13:10.324 --> 01:13:12.444
The station's the other side
of Crowley Woods. Nah.

01:13:12.444 --> 01:13:14.524
She's not gonna go home.

01:13:14.524 --> 01:13:17.644
I mean, what do we know
about Joanne Caswell?

01:13:17.644 --> 01:13:20.564
Well, she's likes to make amends.
Exactly.

01:13:20.564 --> 01:13:23.924
She wanted to prove Beck innocent.

01:13:23.924 --> 01:13:25.644
And she's no slouch.

01:13:25.644 --> 01:13:27.444
She's goes round talking
to everyone,

01:13:27.444 --> 01:13:28.924
trying to find out the truth.

01:13:28.924 --> 01:13:30.884
And then, along comes Wells,

01:13:30.884 --> 01:13:35.284
and says, "Oh, Simon Beck,
he's not so innocent after all."

01:13:35.284 --> 01:13:37.884
So, what's gonna be our girl's
next move?

01:13:37.884 --> 01:13:39.604
She'd want to know if it's true.

01:13:39.604 --> 01:13:42.564
And where's she gonna find that out?
Come on.

01:13:43.964 --> 01:13:45.604
Even if Joanne had come round
that night,

01:13:45.604 --> 01:13:47.804
she wouldn't have found me.
Why not?

01:13:47.804 --> 01:13:49.244
I was working.

01:13:49.244 --> 01:13:51.684
The supermarket at the retail park.
I'm on nights.

01:13:54.484 --> 01:13:58.484
Did you know Jordan Payne?
Not really.

01:13:59.684 --> 01:14:02.324
I used to go to matches with Simon.
I met him a few times.

01:14:02.324 --> 01:14:04.444
I can't say I took to him, though.

01:14:04.444 --> 01:14:06.444
How did your brother
get on with him?

01:14:06.444 --> 01:14:09.524
Well, he had to.
He was on Simon's team.

01:14:09.524 --> 01:14:13.444
No, I mean, outside of football.
I mean, were they close?

01:14:13.444 --> 01:14:15.284
Did you ever see them together?

01:14:15.284 --> 01:14:19.004
What are you saying?
Look, I'm just asking.

01:14:20.044 --> 01:14:25.604
Is it possible...
that Simon had feelings for Jordan?

01:14:25.604 --> 01:14:28.244
Feelings he might have acted on?

01:14:28.244 --> 01:14:29.804
No.

01:14:29.804 --> 01:14:32.084
Never. Not Simon.

01:14:32.084 --> 01:14:35.204
No, look, Ashleigh,
I know you loved your brother.

01:14:35.204 --> 01:14:38.484
But I do need you to think back
to that time...

01:14:38.484 --> 01:14:40.204
No.
..because if that is true,

01:14:40.204 --> 01:14:44.364
it would have given Simon,
perhaps, a reason to kill Jordan.

01:14:45.564 --> 01:14:48.524
Hmm? Makes sense, doesn't it?

01:14:49.964 --> 01:14:51.204
You're wrong.

01:14:52.524 --> 01:14:55.804
Simon wouldn't have gone anywhere
near Jordan Payne.

01:14:55.804 --> 01:14:57.044
He was a horrible lad.

01:14:58.044 --> 01:15:01.804
That's why Simon dropped him.
All the other lads were glad.

01:15:01.804 --> 01:15:03.564
They couldn't stand him!

01:15:05.044 --> 01:15:07.524
I want you out.
SHE SOBS

01:15:15.364 --> 01:15:17.964
Talk about being in denial.

01:15:17.964 --> 01:15:21.164
Poor girl has spent half her life
believing her brother's a saint.

01:15:21.164 --> 01:15:24.204
Can't be easy learning the truth.

01:15:25.604 --> 01:15:26.964
Are you all right?

01:15:28.684 --> 01:15:30.684
Something I need to check.

01:15:31.764 --> 01:15:34.484
And it's that file
that Wells found.

01:15:36.364 --> 01:15:39.084
What's this about?
I'll tell you inside, love.

01:15:40.364 --> 01:15:44.604
What is it we're looking for?
What if she's right - Ashleigh?

01:15:45.604 --> 01:15:47.884
And Simon wasn't interested
in Jordan?

01:15:47.884 --> 01:15:50.324
But he said that he loved him.
Did he?

01:15:53.004 --> 01:15:54.284
Thanks, love.

01:16:01.884 --> 01:16:03.564
Look at that.

01:16:05.964 --> 01:16:07.524
Beck admits it.

01:16:07.524 --> 01:16:10.444
Psych asks for a name.
Beck says, "Jordan Payne."

01:16:10.444 --> 01:16:13.044
Yeah, but look how
he describes Jordan.

01:16:13.044 --> 01:16:17.444
"Quiet. Sensitive. Thoughtful."
Aye.

01:16:19.724 --> 01:16:20.924
That's not Jordan Payne.

01:16:22.124 --> 01:16:23.764
Beck was lying.

01:16:23.764 --> 01:16:27.964
And he was lying to protect the lad
he was really in love with.

01:16:45.764 --> 01:16:50.004
Hey, I'm sorry, Natalie,
but we need to talk to Kieran.

01:16:50.004 --> 01:16:52.044
He's not here.
Where is he?

01:16:52.044 --> 01:16:54.404
He's out.
He said he wanted a walk.

01:16:54.404 --> 01:16:58.004
Now, on the night
that Joanne Caswell was killed,

01:16:58.004 --> 01:17:00.804
where were you?
Me and Ryan were at my mum's.

01:17:00.804 --> 01:17:02.484
Was Kieran with you?

01:17:04.484 --> 01:17:06.324
Where was he, Natalie?

01:17:07.404 --> 01:17:09.364
He was here, at the flat.

01:17:09.364 --> 01:17:13.204
And was anyone else with him?
No, of course not.

01:17:14.484 --> 01:17:16.364
Please can you tell me
what this is about?

01:17:16.364 --> 01:17:18.004
Excuse me.

01:17:38.804 --> 01:17:40.644
You look that way.

01:18:12.524 --> 01:18:14.444
So, did you love him?

01:18:17.604 --> 01:18:18.924
No?

01:18:20.564 --> 01:18:22.324
What was it, then? Hmm?

01:18:26.684 --> 01:18:29.844
And how did Jordan fit into this?

01:18:33.924 --> 01:18:35.124
We got careless.

01:18:36.364 --> 01:18:38.364
Jordan clocked us
coming out of Simon's house.

01:18:38.364 --> 01:18:41.164
He wasn't stupid.
He knew he had us.

01:18:41.164 --> 01:18:42.924
Blackmail.

01:18:42.924 --> 01:18:45.044
He was an evil little bastard,
you know?

01:18:46.724 --> 01:18:49.524
Still no reason
for Simon to kill him.

01:18:59.164 --> 01:19:01.524
Right, the day Jordan died...

01:19:02.724 --> 01:19:07.044
..you saw Frank
going into the woods. Is that right?

01:19:08.364 --> 01:19:09.804
Mm.

01:19:09.804 --> 01:19:12.244
Now, I reckon you saw him

01:19:12.244 --> 01:19:15.644
because you were coming
out of the woods.

01:19:29.324 --> 01:19:31.924
Simon was a mess.

01:19:31.924 --> 01:19:34.644
He was worried that, no matter
how much he paid Jordan,

01:19:34.644 --> 01:19:35.924
he wouldn't keep quiet.

01:19:37.124 --> 01:19:39.924
So, I caught up with Jordan
in the woods after training.

01:19:41.924 --> 01:19:43.404
I wanted to talk to him.

01:19:45.244 --> 01:19:46.444
It was no use.

01:19:47.804 --> 01:19:49.204
He kept laughing.

01:19:50.244 --> 01:19:52.404
Calling me and Simon perverts.

01:19:52.404 --> 01:19:55.924
He said they'd string us up
if they found out.

01:19:59.204 --> 01:20:02.924
Look, I don't know...
who started it.

01:20:04.844 --> 01:20:06.564
But it was probably me.

01:20:08.604 --> 01:20:10.204
And before I knew it...

01:20:11.844 --> 01:20:15.804
..I was on top of him.
I had my hands around his neck.

01:20:18.404 --> 01:20:20.284
And then, that was it.

01:20:20.284 --> 01:20:23.164
Then I came back here
and I told Simon

01:20:23.164 --> 01:20:25.164
and I was panicking, I was crying.

01:20:26.164 --> 01:20:29.724
And I asked him what I should do
and he said that he would sort it.

01:20:32.604 --> 01:20:33.924
So...

01:20:36.324 --> 01:20:38.484
I went home...

01:20:38.484 --> 01:20:40.644
and I waited.

01:20:42.684 --> 01:20:45.164
And I figured that you lot
would come for me.

01:20:45.164 --> 01:20:47.444
And then, two days later,

01:20:47.444 --> 01:20:50.164
I found out
that Simon had confessed.

01:20:53.804 --> 01:20:56.084
So, I guess
that he must have loved me,

01:20:56.084 --> 01:20:57.964
to take the blame like he did.

01:20:57.964 --> 01:21:01.244
Ah, the things we do for love, eh?

01:21:02.404 --> 01:21:06.164
Nah. You were only 15, love.

01:21:06.164 --> 01:21:11.204
What happened between you and Beck
was abuse and he knew it.

01:21:13.044 --> 01:21:15.044
It didn't feel like abuse
at the time.

01:21:17.004 --> 01:21:19.284
Now, the day Joanne died,

01:21:19.284 --> 01:21:21.884
did she come to see you
at your flat?

01:21:23.324 --> 01:21:24.484
She was upset.

01:21:25.444 --> 01:21:28.124
She'd heard some things about Simon,

01:21:28.124 --> 01:21:29.924
things that she didn't
want to believe.

01:21:30.924 --> 01:21:32.844
So, what did you tell her?

01:21:32.844 --> 01:21:34.804
I put her straight.

01:21:35.804 --> 01:21:37.164
I told her the truth.

01:21:37.164 --> 01:21:40.244
What, about you and Beck?
About everything.

01:21:42.604 --> 01:21:46.324
Anyway, she said that I could hand
myself in, which was nice of her.

01:21:46.324 --> 01:21:48.764
But you weren't gonna do that,
were you, pet?

01:21:50.884 --> 01:21:53.164
I mean, I've got a family...

01:21:53.164 --> 01:21:54.204
a wife.

01:21:58.244 --> 01:21:59.444
Ryan.

01:22:05.964 --> 01:22:08.644
I couldn't have her
out in the world...

01:22:10.204 --> 01:22:11.684
..knowing what she knew.

01:22:13.284 --> 01:22:14.964
So, I let her leave the flat

01:22:14.964 --> 01:22:17.844
and then I caught up with her
in the woods.

01:22:20.404 --> 01:22:22.804
I killed her, right there and then.

01:22:24.324 --> 01:22:25.564
I'm sorry.

01:22:28.204 --> 01:22:29.924
I've really... I'm...

01:22:29.924 --> 01:22:31.844
I am so sorry.

01:22:35.284 --> 01:22:36.484
Ma'am?

01:22:38.244 --> 01:22:40.084
Come on, son.

01:22:42.564 --> 01:22:43.764
Are you all right?

01:23:02.364 --> 01:23:05.884
Two murders. Almost 15 years apart.

01:23:05.884 --> 01:23:07.124
Same killer.

01:23:08.524 --> 01:23:09.844
Same location.

01:23:10.844 --> 01:23:12.804
And practically the same motive.

01:23:12.804 --> 01:23:14.844
And they say that lightning
doesn't strike twice.

01:23:14.844 --> 01:23:16.764
It doesn't. Jac?

01:23:16.764 --> 01:23:20.644
'Yes, ma'am?'
I need you to do something for me.

01:23:34.284 --> 01:23:36.004
Can I come in, love?

01:23:40.364 --> 01:23:42.044
Natalie...

01:23:42.044 --> 01:23:44.084
I need you to help me
with something.

01:23:44.084 --> 01:23:46.084
Where's Kieran?
He's down at the station, love.

01:23:46.084 --> 01:23:47.444
Why? What's happened?

01:23:47.444 --> 01:23:50.364
Now, one of my officers
went through Kieran's phone records

01:23:50.364 --> 01:23:52.444
on the night that Joanne died

01:23:52.444 --> 01:23:57.324
and it seems you called Kieran
just after 11 that night.

01:23:57.324 --> 01:24:01.044
Can you remember
what that was about? Erm...

01:24:01.044 --> 01:24:03.564
Oh, cos you were here,
at your mum's.

01:24:03.564 --> 01:24:05.124
Probably to say goodnight.

01:24:06.244 --> 01:24:10.484
You see, he just told us
that he killed Joanne.

01:24:12.324 --> 01:24:16.924
Now, are you sure you were here
when you made that call, Natalie?

01:24:20.604 --> 01:24:22.764
Or were you somewhere else?

01:24:26.764 --> 01:24:31.204
Were you in Crowley Woods, Natalie?
SHE WHIMPERS

01:24:40.964 --> 01:24:44.044
So, what happened? Hmm?

01:24:49.164 --> 01:24:51.004
What happened, Natalie?

01:24:53.364 --> 01:24:55.364
I forgot Ryan's bunny.

01:24:57.164 --> 01:25:01.084
He can't sleep without it, so
I left him here at my mum's, and...

01:25:01.084 --> 01:25:02.764
I went back to the flat to get it.

01:25:02.764 --> 01:25:05.764
I was on my way up
when I saw her on the stairs.

01:25:08.204 --> 01:25:09.724
She looked frightened.

01:25:10.804 --> 01:25:13.484
I asked her what she was doing
there and she said...

01:25:13.484 --> 01:25:15.884
I should just go up
and speak to Kieran.

01:25:18.124 --> 01:25:19.764
When I walked in,

01:25:19.764 --> 01:25:22.684
he was on the floor,
balling his eyes out.

01:25:22.684 --> 01:25:25.644
Like a kid.
Then it all came out.

01:25:28.164 --> 01:25:30.484
All the stuff about Jordan...

01:25:31.724 --> 01:25:32.924
..and Beck.

01:25:33.924 --> 01:25:35.884
And he's talking about forgiveness
and...

01:25:37.244 --> 01:25:39.284
..guilt and...

01:25:40.684 --> 01:25:42.724
..and me and Ryan.

01:25:43.804 --> 01:25:46.004
I remember thinking to myself,
"This is bad.

01:25:46.964 --> 01:25:50.244
"Natalie,
you're gonna have to handle this.

01:25:50.244 --> 01:25:52.204
"You're gonna have to be strong."

01:25:52.204 --> 01:25:53.964
So, you went after her.

01:25:54.964 --> 01:25:56.604
Is that right?
Just to talk with her.

01:25:56.604 --> 01:25:59.244
To make sure
she wasn't gonna go to you lot.

01:25:59.244 --> 01:26:00.604
You took a knife, Natalie.

01:26:00.604 --> 01:26:02.964
I wanted her to know
I wasn't some daft lass.

01:26:02.964 --> 01:26:06.244
I was a wife and a mother
and I was to be taken seriously.

01:26:07.244 --> 01:26:08.764
I went out and...

01:26:08.764 --> 01:26:11.964
I couldn't find her anywhere.
I thought I'd lost her and then I...

01:26:14.244 --> 01:26:15.444
I remember...

01:26:17.404 --> 01:26:19.004
..she'd be going to the station.

01:26:21.204 --> 01:26:23.364
And I found her near the clearing.

01:26:26.004 --> 01:26:28.284
She said
she wasn't gonna say anything.

01:26:30.084 --> 01:26:32.284
That she'd decided
to let it all be.

01:26:32.284 --> 01:26:34.324
That she'd decided
And I wanted to believe her.

01:26:36.604 --> 01:26:38.324
I really did.

01:26:40.484 --> 01:26:43.244
Six times, Natalie.

01:26:43.244 --> 01:26:47.684
You stabbed that poor lass
six times. I know.

01:26:50.084 --> 01:26:52.484
I couldn't look at her afterward.

01:26:52.484 --> 01:26:55.724
She was on the ground
and I was just standing there,

01:26:55.724 --> 01:26:58.524
shaking and crying at her.
I didn't know what to do.

01:26:58.524 --> 01:27:01.124
So, you called Kieran.

01:27:03.324 --> 01:27:05.764
The look on his face
when he saw her.

01:27:07.004 --> 01:27:09.004
So, did he deal with the body?

01:27:10.324 --> 01:27:11.884
He brought the car to the woods.

01:27:13.284 --> 01:27:15.484
Then I helped him
put her in the boot.

01:27:17.764 --> 01:27:20.004
Then he told me
to go back to Ryan.

01:27:21.724 --> 01:27:23.564
And that's what I did.

01:27:32.684 --> 01:27:38.164
Natalie Webb, I'm arresting you
for the murder of Joanne Caswell.

01:27:38.164 --> 01:27:40.724
You do not have to say anything,

01:27:40.724 --> 01:27:42.804
but it may harm your defence

01:27:42.804 --> 01:27:45.164
if you fail to answer,
when questioned,

01:27:45.164 --> 01:27:47.644
something you later rely on
in court.

01:27:52.884 --> 01:27:56.284
It doesn't feel like a win, does it?
It never does.

01:27:56.284 --> 01:27:59.124
I mean, obviously,
they did it, but...

01:27:59.124 --> 01:28:00.644
I can't help but feel for them.

01:28:01.724 --> 01:28:03.604
But what about Joanne?

01:28:03.604 --> 01:28:05.404
Or Jordan Payne?

01:28:05.404 --> 01:28:08.804
Young Ryan.
Don't you feel for them, too?

01:28:09.884 --> 01:28:11.884
Yeah, I suppose.

01:28:14.164 --> 01:28:16.604
Right. Come on.
Where are we going?

01:28:16.604 --> 01:28:18.564
Well, you're going home.

01:28:18.564 --> 01:28:22.084
Spend some time with that
bairn of yours you hardly ever see.

01:28:23.324 --> 01:28:26.684
Yeah, I meant to tell you.
He's starting reading, you know.

01:28:26.684 --> 01:28:31.124
Full sentences and everything.
Oh? Proper little Einstein.

01:28:32.884 --> 01:28:34.924
Go on, say it.

01:28:34.924 --> 01:28:36.684
Takes after his mam.
