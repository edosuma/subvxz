-Any idea why she remembers you?
-No, but lucky she did.

32:21.523 --> 32:23.764
When she found me,
she was scared out of her mind.

32:23.942 --> 32:27.184
I thought if she saw you,
it would jump-start her memory.

32:28.864 --> 32:30.570
Thank you for bringing her home.

32:31.033 --> 32:34.491
It's no problem.
This is where she belongs.

32:34.661 --> 32:36.162
Looks like she's in good hands.

32:37.205 --> 32:39.196
Call me if you need me.

32:40.083 --> 32:41.823
We need to get her to Smallville Med.

32:42.002 --> 32:44.243
I'll take her to the car.
Grab some of her stuff.

32:44.421 --> 32:46.377
-l'|l meet you out back.
-Yeah.

33:07.402 --> 33:10.360
JOR-EL:
Time is of the essence, Kai-El.

33:11.239 --> 33:14.527
Chloe never would have gotten hurt
if she wasn't trying to protect me.

33:15.661 --> 33:20.576
JOR-EL: I tried to warn you of the danger
in sharing your true identity.

33:21.375 --> 33:23.866
But now that I'm taking more risks...

33:26.922 --> 33:29.129
...it's even more dangerous for her.

33:31.301 --> 33:34.793
Chloe deserves a life free
from the burden of my secret.

33:35.931 --> 33:40.095
When you restore her memory, I don't want
her to remember anything about Krypton...

33:40.644 --> 33:42.635
...or my abilities.

33:43.063 --> 33:46.851
JOR-EL: I know this choice
is not easy for you, my son.

33:47.776 --> 33:50.142
But it will be done.

33:57.119 --> 34:00.486
You've been the best friend
and ally I could have had, Chloe.

34:02.749 --> 34:06.116
The truth is you've saved me
more than I ever could have saved you.

34:18.890 --> 34:23.133
I'm sorry to go back
to hiding the truth from you.

34:27.524 --> 34:32.484
But the best way that I know to protect you
is to let you go.

35:09.983 --> 35:12.190
CHLOE:
Jimmy, I'm impressed.

35:12.360 --> 35:15.227
You managed to balance out singles,
couples and families...

35:15.405 --> 35:17.942
...while keeping all of the exes
at different tables...

35:18.116 --> 35:20.778
...and still keeping the kids table
away from the cake.

35:20.952 --> 35:23.159
You truly are the Zen master
of seating charts.

35:24.206 --> 35:27.118
More the master of musical chairs.
But now that this is over...

35:27.292 --> 35:30.500
...I don't wanna see, sit
or stand on another chair for a long while.

35:30.670 --> 35:33.582
Well, then let's just live on the couch.

35:37.886 --> 35:40.218
-What?
-You're amazing.

35:40.889 --> 35:44.097
You had about the fastest
spontaneous recovery in history.

35:44.601 --> 35:46.933
Yeah, I don't know exactly what I did.

35:47.103 --> 35:51.722
I mean, one minute, I'm standing
in the Talon, not recognizing you or Clark.

35:51.900 --> 35:54.312
And then suddenly,
I feel a sharp sting of a needle.

35:54.486 --> 35:58.525
Next thing I know, I wake up in the hospital,
happy to see you both right by my side.

35:59.199 --> 36:02.487
I wonder if Davis' knockout punch
had anything to do with it.

36:03.286 --> 36:06.494
It deﬁnitely was a miracle,
plain and simple.

36:06.665 --> 36:08.326
CHLOE:
Clark Kent...

36:08.500 --> 36:11.367
...the best-looking best man in town.

36:12.462 --> 36:15.295
Second only to my gorgeous groom,
of course.

36:15.465 --> 36:19.128
I'm just glad the bride is safe.
Everything's back to the way it used to be.

36:20.679 --> 36:21.794
Oh, wow!

36:23.431 --> 36:27.765
I gotta get to Metropolis to drop off
our check to the ﬂorist before they close.

36:28.353 --> 36:30.685
-l'|l make a run to the city.
-Are you kidding me?

36:30.856 --> 36:33.563
That's like a two-hour trip,
and you drive like an old lady.

36:34.609 --> 36:38.022
Are you sure you're feeling up to it?
I really don't mind coming along.

36:38.196 --> 36:41.939
I'm perfectly ﬁne stopping
and smelling the roses on my own.

36:44.494 --> 36:48.203
Besides, there's a whole bunch of folding
tables he needs to set up at the farm.

36:48.373 --> 36:52.707
And I, uh, seriously doubt that
Clark can carry all of them by himself.

37:06.016 --> 37:07.222
[SIGHS]

37:13.106 --> 37:14.471
DAVIS:
Chloe.

37:14.649 --> 37:15.980
Hey, you.

37:16.151 --> 37:17.482
You sneaking up on me?

37:17.652 --> 37:20.359
Don't have any hypodermic needles
up your sleeves, do you?

37:20.530 --> 37:22.987
Oh, no. Not a needle in sight.
Sorry I had to do that to you.

37:23.158 --> 37:25.900
Are you kidding me? If you hadn't hit me
with your best shot...

37:26.077 --> 37:28.284
...I never would have
gone with Clark and Jimmy.

37:28.455 --> 37:32.118
Oh, by the way, I heard
you're not gonna make it to my wedding.

37:32.292 --> 37:36.035
-l'm really gonna miss you being there.
-Chloe, I lied.

37:36.504 --> 37:39.291
They don't need me
at the hospital that day.

37:39.466 --> 37:43.084
Please, tell me that this isn't
because of all the drama I put you through.

37:43.261 --> 37:45.638
-You know that I wasn't in my right mind.
-No, no.

37:46.222 --> 37:48.759
It's not you. You're beautiful.

37:52.020 --> 37:54.807
There's a lot in my life
that I don't understand right now...

37:54.981 --> 38:00.567
...but the one thing that I'm sure of
is how I feel about you.

38:02.864 --> 38:06.857
I can't go to your wedding, Chloe, because
I can't watch you marry the wrong man.

38:07.619 --> 38:11.032
Okay, Davis, you need to slow down
and put your ambulance in reverse.

38:11.206 --> 38:14.164
I'll admit that when we ﬁrst met,
there was an attraction.

38:14.334 --> 38:17.952
I mean, you're kind
and you save people's lives...

38:18.129 --> 38:23.499
...and you look great in a uniform,
so of course I'm gonna like you.

38:23.677 --> 38:27.169
-But I love Jimmy.
-Do you? Do you really?

38:27.681 --> 38:30.343
I tried to be the bigger man.
I brought you back to him...

38:30.517 --> 38:33.805
...even though all I wanted to do
was take care of you myself.

38:34.354 --> 38:35.890
But then I thought about it.

38:36.314 --> 38:39.477
When you forgot about everyone else
in your life...

38:39.651 --> 38:41.607
...who did you come to for help?

38:41.778 --> 38:45.236
Not Jimmy.
Not even your best friend, Clark.

38:45.407 --> 38:47.147
It was me.

38:49.327 --> 38:51.033
You came to me.

38:51.705 --> 38:52.740
Davis, l--

38:52.914 --> 38:55.326
There is some sort of connection
between us, Chloe...

38:55.500 --> 38:57.866
...and I know that you feel it too.

39:07.637 --> 39:09.343
Okay, stop. Um....

39:09.514 --> 39:13.132
Davis, this connection, it was--
It was never this.

39:16.604 --> 39:18.595
I understand.

39:20.775 --> 39:22.640
But I am not ready to let you go.

39:28.116 --> 39:31.574
I will wait for as long as it takes.

39:36.833 --> 39:38.744
You know where to ﬁnd me.

39:52.724 --> 39:54.339
Jor-El.

39:57.729 --> 40:00.436
I've come here to thank you
for what you've done.

40:02.025 --> 40:05.358
Chloe's a lot safer now that
she doesn't remember the truth about me.

40:06.780 --> 40:09.988
I guess I'm just starting to realize
how much I actually lost.

40:10.158 --> 40:11.568
JOR-EL:
You made a difficult choice.

40:12.994 --> 40:15.406
I am proud of you, Kai-El.

40:16.915 --> 40:19.748
But something else is troubling you.

40:21.044 --> 40:24.502
I know that we defeated Brainiac,
but we may have another problem.

40:24.672 --> 40:26.333
When Chloe was losing her memory...

40:26.508 --> 40:29.341
...she kept seeing the Kryptonian symbol
for doom in her mind.

40:30.512 --> 40:34.926
JOR-EL: The symbol for doom
represents the ultimate destroyer.

40:35.183 --> 40:38.050
A Kryptonian creature
bred for a single purpose...

40:38.978 --> 40:40.354
...to kill.

40:40.522 --> 40:43.229
It adapts and evolves to any attack.

40:44.317 --> 40:46.649
It is virtually unstoppable.

40:47.570 --> 40:51.859
And it appears
it's made its way to Earth.

40:52.033 --> 40:55.696
So Brainiac was trying to contact this thing
using Chloe as a vessel.

40:56.246 --> 41:01.866
JOR-EL: If that is true, then it is likely
the creature will ﬁnd her soon.

41:02.043 --> 41:03.658
I don't care how powerful it is.

41:04.963 --> 41:07.875
I'll take it on, like I have everything else.

41:08.800 --> 41:11.587
JOR-EL:
I am here for you as well, my son.

41:14.722 --> 41:16.178
Thank you...

41:17.225 --> 41:18.715
...Father.

41:26.818 --> 41:28.399
JOR-EL:
My son?

41:29.487 --> 41:31.068
My son?

41:31.489 --> 41:34.731
BRAINIAC:
Your son is destined to fail.

41:34.909 --> 41:37.742
Soon, a new age will dawn on Earth.

41:37.912 --> 41:40.949
An age of power and strength...

41:41.124 --> 41:44.912
...and the fall of the House of El.

41:47.255 --> 41:49.712
Doomsday is coming.
