WEBVTT

00:00.483 --> 00:02.505
Carroll was convicted in 2004

00:02.624 --> 00:04.967
for the murders
of 14 young women.

00:05.093 --> 00:07.578
Breakup sex can be fun.

00:08.580 --> 00:10.419
This is Sheriff Nelson
of Havenport,

00:10.522 --> 00:11.324
neighboring town.

00:11.426 --> 00:12.469
Whatever we can do to help.

00:12.568 --> 00:13.614
Put your hands up.

00:13.709 --> 00:15.023
Hey! Stop!

00:15.135 --> 00:16.451
Okay. So we
made Roderick.

00:16.544 --> 00:18.313
I think the cult's gonna
try to make a move now.

00:18.412 --> 00:19.769
I fixed the property records

00:19.868 --> 00:20.641
and hid this place,

00:20.731 --> 00:22.663
but they will find us!

00:22.754 --> 00:25.323
You need to pull
yourself together.

00:25.686 --> 00:26.505
Unh!

00:26.908 --> 00:28.216
Mom!

00:28.302 --> 00:30.067
What's going on?
Why did he take Joey?

00:30.157 --> 00:32.947
Claire! I said
I will find Joey.

00:33.036 --> 00:35.372
If you find him, please
don't bring him back here.

00:35.457 --> 00:36.889
You have one job
since the beginning and

00:36.983 --> 00:39.080
that was to watch over my son.

00:39.195 --> 00:40.504
Claire tried
to kill--

00:40.916 --> 00:42.238
Drop your weapon!

00:42.369 --> 00:43.241
Get down!

00:44.303 --> 00:45.436
Let him go, Jacob!

00:45.520 --> 00:47.240
Joe doesn't care
if you live or die.

00:48.669 --> 00:50.461
You okay?
Come here.

00:51.551 --> 00:52.996
We're gonna die soon.

00:53.088 --> 00:54.461
I can feel it.

00:55.932 --> 00:57.256
Unh!

00:59.222 --> 01:00.590
Hello, Ryan.
I'm sorry to say

01:00.699 --> 01:04.180
that our story has taken
an unexpected turn.

01:04.279 --> 01:07.851
Sadly, it is time
for Claire to die.

Ha ha!

01:24.348 --> 01:25.447
Ho ho ho!

01:25.526 --> 01:26.657
I have to come over more often.

01:26.750 --> 01:28.829
This breakup sex is hot.

01:29.188 --> 01:30.163
Heh heh heh.

01:31.424 --> 01:32.709
Is this okay?

01:34.429 --> 01:35.964
Yeah. Just need
a minute.

01:36.075 --> 01:37.208
Ha ha ha!

01:39.251 --> 01:40.113
Ohh.

01:46.918 --> 01:48.831
You know that booze
is gonna kill you.

01:50.302 --> 01:52.110
Can't kill me.
I'm already dead.

01:57.103 --> 01:58.932
Can't kill me.
I'm already dead.

01:59.905 --> 02:01.557
You can't kill me.

02:02.281 --> 02:04.184
Can't kill me.
I'm already dead.

02:04.564 --> 02:05.838
I'm already dead.

02:06.524 --> 02:08.364
Can't kill me.
I'm already dead.

02:08.619 --> 02:10.479
Can't kill me.
I'm already dead.

02:10.640 --> 02:12.186
Can't kill me.
I'm already dead.

02:12.376 --> 02:14.148
Can't kill me.
I'm already dead.

02:14.670 --> 02:16.025
Can't kill me.
I'm already dead.

02:16.124 --> 02:17.350
Can't kill me.

02:20.961 --> 02:22.640
I'm already dead.

02:30.637 --> 02:34.293
Now you understand everything
I have told you, yes?

02:34.389 --> 02:35.851
Do you have any questions?

02:35.935 --> 02:39.287
Because this is
extremely important.

02:39.374 --> 02:41.075
Been through it 10 times, Joe.
I think I've got it.

02:41.197 --> 02:43.812
Excellent. Good.

02:43.914 --> 02:47.296
Because with, uh--
with Roderick gone,

02:48.261 --> 02:53.216
I am in dire need of someone
to trust, Emma, so--

02:54.165 --> 02:56.997
oh, dear.
Do I frighten you?

02:57.587 --> 02:59.412
Oh, yes.
Of course I do.

02:59.496 --> 03:01.039
It's completely my fault.

03:01.131 --> 03:05.079
I have been a tad
erratic of late,

03:05.170 --> 03:06.452
so let me apologize.

03:06.505 --> 03:09.405
Last night, I was
angry and upset,

03:09.506 --> 03:10.698
and I took it all out on you.

03:10.786 --> 03:13.554
It was insensitive
and inappropriate,

03:13.680 --> 03:19.578
so please do forgive me, Emma.

03:23.112 --> 03:24.857
Of course.

03:25.867 --> 03:26.976
Hmm.

03:29.935 --> 03:31.701
How is your wound?
Are you okay?

03:31.802 --> 03:33.577
Oh. It, uh...

03:35.720 --> 03:37.377
hurts like hell.

03:37.677 --> 03:42.127
Claire was crafty
with that bloody knife.

03:43.942 --> 03:46.599
But I remain undaunted!

03:46.696 --> 03:50.053
We have got so much to do.

03:51.529 --> 03:53.349
The FBI is in full force here

03:53.510 --> 03:54.880
as the manhunt for Joe Carroll

03:55.002 --> 03:56.891
and his cult
of killers continues.

03:56.971 --> 03:59.206
You'll be backing us up with
assists from State Police.

03:59.314 --> 04:01.887
Local law enforcement is gonna
stay sidelined for the time being.

04:01.993 --> 04:03.683
Right. Let's go.

04:06.316 --> 04:08.461
Nick made it to DC
he's in surgery.

04:08.598 --> 04:09.641
There's no word yet.

04:09.728 --> 04:11.442
Joey Matthews is being
held at headquarters.

04:11.515 --> 04:12.622
Claire's mother's en route.

04:13.026 --> 04:14.360
They'll go in hiding
immediately.

04:14.462 --> 04:15.966
Keep me posted on both.

04:17.517 --> 04:19.435
Joey Matthews gave us
a detailed description

04:19.529 --> 04:20.374
of the house, okay,

04:20.464 --> 04:23.018
so we're looking for a
3-story, red brick mansion

04:23.115 --> 04:24.724
surrounded by acres of land.

04:24.818 --> 04:27.013
It's got a pond,
it's got a large main gate,

04:27.111 --> 04:28.821
so we need to start with all
the estates in the area.

04:28.903 --> 04:29.905
The town records
tell us there's

04:30.018 --> 04:31.789
47 such houses in the county.

04:31.871 --> 04:33.023
There's two different
country clubs

04:33.122 --> 04:34.189
with roughly 20 each.

04:34.276 --> 04:35.871
We're narrowing down
topography with satellite.

04:35.953 --> 04:36.965
We've got choppers in the air,

04:37.054 --> 04:38.198
we've got roadblocks in place,

04:38.295 --> 04:40.021
we've got the Coast Guard
on the waterways.

04:40.139 --> 04:42.269
We're gonna work in teams
and cover the entire town.

04:42.373 --> 04:44.933
Want you to keep
in constant radio contact.

04:45.080 --> 04:46.422
Let's find them.

04:47.931 --> 04:50.918
In death, there is life.

04:51.050 --> 04:53.750
In death, there is love.

04:53.855 --> 04:57.696
In death, there is everything.

05:03.519 --> 05:05.128
Your love...

05:06.671 --> 05:09.297
overwhelms me.

05:11.574 --> 05:19.109
Today is going to be
the most special of days

05:19.237 --> 05:20.793
for all of us.

05:21.582 --> 05:22.720
Thank you.

05:24.963 --> 05:28.383
Aimee, you be strong,

05:28.837 --> 05:30.586
be fierce.

05:30.750 --> 05:32.247
For you.

05:42.718 --> 05:44.436
Are you sure they're
all ready for this?

05:44.533 --> 05:45.663
Are you kidding?

05:45.930 --> 05:47.729
We've all been waiting
for exactly this.

05:47.822 --> 05:48.771
Everyone knows their role?

05:48.862 --> 05:51.437
We've gone over it
again and again.

05:51.547 --> 05:53.710
We've trained, sir.
We're ready.

05:55.077 --> 05:58.077
And you, Aaron, hmm?

05:59.514 --> 06:00.800
Are you ready for this?

06:00.897 --> 06:02.557
We all play different
parts, sir.

06:03.285 --> 06:05.685
Yeah.

06:08.029 --> 06:09.541
We'll stay in contact.

06:09.613 --> 06:10.978
Timing will be important.

06:11.074 --> 06:11.966
Don't worry, Joe.

06:12.045 --> 06:14.247
We're gonna get you and your
wife out of this house safely,

06:14.347 --> 06:15.898
even if it's the
last thing we do.

06:15.984 --> 06:17.486
Thank you, Alex.

06:18.253 --> 06:21.093
I appreciate your dedication.

06:21.250 --> 06:22.688
It's my honor.

06:24.629 --> 06:25.978
Whole world is watching.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.879
Today is the day that our story

06:28.955 --> 06:31.764
will finally be heard.

06:34.766 --> 06:36.018
Thank you.

06:48.858 --> 06:50.257
This is insane.

06:51.011 --> 06:52.197
What?

06:52.871 --> 06:54.306
We can't stay here.
We have to leave.

06:54.398 --> 06:56.263
I know that.
It's Joe's plan.

06:56.358 --> 06:57.252
It's crazy, all right?

06:57.349 --> 06:58.453
He's not thinking clearly.

06:58.535 --> 07:00.561
He's all hopped up on
booze and pain pills.

07:00.645 --> 07:01.880
This is what he wants.

07:01.941 --> 07:03.159
What's your problem?

07:03.488 --> 07:06.909
How do you know that
he's not using us

07:07.016 --> 07:08.096
just so he can get out of town?

07:08.185 --> 07:09.706
He is taking us with him,

07:10.889 --> 07:12.122
trusting us,

07:12.215 --> 07:13.704
you and me more than anyone.

07:13.820 --> 07:15.853
I don't know that we should be

07:15.986 --> 07:17.434
trusting him right now.

07:17.544 --> 07:19.546
I can't help you
with your trust issues.

07:19.672 --> 07:22.851
Well, trusting people doesn't
work too well for me,

07:22.942 --> 07:24.702
does it, Emma?

07:26.152 --> 07:27.640
Suck it up.

07:38.774 --> 07:41.619
Unh. Morning, Claire.

07:43.255 --> 07:44.926
Oh. You don't
look so good.

07:45.017 --> 07:45.954
Neither do you.

07:46.061 --> 07:47.313
Heh. Tell me about it.

07:47.407 --> 07:49.584
You should see a doctor.
That looks really nasty.

07:50.144 --> 07:51.955
Well, thank you
for your concern.

07:52.062 --> 07:53.923
I have, in fact,
been stitched up,

07:54.008 --> 07:55.240
so I'm gonna be fine.

07:55.342 --> 07:58.661
You on the other hand,
not so much.

07:58.750 --> 08:00.887
You see, I, uh,
I finished the rewrite,

08:01.832 --> 08:05.306
and I tried, Claire,
I really tried.

08:05.421 --> 08:09.458
I searched my soul
for one good reason

08:09.548 --> 08:11.072
to let your character live,

08:11.174 --> 08:12.220
but you know what?

08:12.322 --> 08:16.355
I-- I couldn't come up
with a single one.

08:17.635 --> 08:21.201
So if you don't mind,
after you.

08:21.447 --> 08:23.526
Joe, don't do this.
Don't do this.

08:23.616 --> 08:27.200
Don't do this. Joe!
Joe! Joe?

08:30.712 --> 08:31.937
Scroll.

08:32.453 --> 08:33.621
Scroll up.

08:33.955 --> 08:35.155
Stop right there.

08:37.546 --> 08:38.721
What is this?

08:39.087 --> 08:40.460
I don't know, but satellite
imagery doesn't match

08:40.558 --> 08:41.721
with the property manifests.

08:41.804 --> 08:42.605
What do you mean?

08:42.686 --> 08:44.576
Someone's tampered with these records.
They don't match up.

08:44.667 --> 08:46.124
It's a total sleight of hand.

08:46.883 --> 08:48.435
They've been doctored like
the surveillance cameras

08:48.517 --> 08:49.470
during Carroll's escape.

08:49.550 --> 08:50.701
Look.

08:54.728 --> 08:58.040
House. Gate. Pond.

08:58.779 --> 09:01.511
In the northwest.
That's it.

09:01.695 --> 09:03.439
We got it.
We got the house.

09:18.959 --> 09:19.840
Let's go!

09:30.862 --> 09:32.725
Go, go! Move!

09:35.705 --> 09:36.595
Clear!

09:38.709 --> 09:39.469
Clear!

09:40.774 --> 09:41.504
Clear!

09:42.873 --> 09:44.353
House is empty, sir.

09:58.843 --> 10:01.981
_

10:02.703 --> 10:03.724
We're going to be
stuck in traffic.

10:03.815 --> 10:05.787
The news said the roadblock
was two hours.

10:06.288 --> 10:07.373
Left my charger on the counter.

10:07.468 --> 10:08.582
Oh. Grab me
a water, please.

10:21.353 --> 10:22.612
Can I help you?

10:23.929 --> 10:26.116
We were really hoping
you wouldn't be home.

10:29.470 --> 10:31.522
Oh, God! Phil!
Oh, my God!

10:32.263 --> 10:33.250
Phil!

10:35.833 --> 10:37.043
Phil!

10:37.282 --> 10:40.618
Vicky! No!

10:47.147 --> 10:48.932
You must be Vicky.

10:50.313 --> 10:51.642
Your husband and I
were just having

10:51.742 --> 10:53.689
a nice, little chat about you.

11:03.126 --> 11:05.042
So why leave a hanging body?

11:05.142 --> 11:06.224
To spook us.

11:06.321 --> 11:07.335
Show of power.

11:07.419 --> 11:08.708
To tell us he's
still in control?

11:08.793 --> 11:10.039
Yeah. That's the idea,
but I'm guessing

11:10.137 --> 11:12.041
he's not so in control
right now.

11:12.130 --> 11:13.030
We're gaining on him.

11:13.107 --> 11:14.315
You think Joe's still in town?

11:14.413 --> 11:16.082
Yeah, I do, but not for long.

11:16.179 --> 11:17.337
All right.
We're running prints.

11:17.430 --> 11:19.398
Did a quick breakdown of
groceries, dishes, bed linens.

11:19.490 --> 11:21.402
I estimate 37 actual residents.

11:21.471 --> 11:22.973
Have all the traffic
checkpoints on high alert,

11:23.075 --> 11:25.527
special attention to cars
with more than 4 people.

11:25.622 --> 11:27.031
Notify the Coast Guard to search

11:27.138 --> 11:28.338
all outgoing boats.

11:28.432 --> 11:29.330
All right.

11:59.455 --> 12:03.230
_

12:12.655 --> 12:14.215
"The Mask
Of The Red Death."

12:17.336 --> 12:18.983
Seen this before,

12:19.722 --> 12:21.099
but why did he leave it for us?

12:21.192 --> 12:23.294
To distract us, to
take us off point.

12:23.403 --> 12:24.733
Something happened with Claire.

12:24.814 --> 12:26.744
I mean, he took her and Joey.

12:27.203 --> 12:29.308
Some kind of fictional attempt

12:29.395 --> 12:30.473
to reunite his family,

12:30.545 --> 12:32.648
but that was never gonna
work, not with her.

12:34.084 --> 12:35.843
I think she did
something to upset him.

12:35.927 --> 12:38.461
She's not gonna live
up to some false idea,

12:39.085 --> 12:41.217
so she's ruining
his perfect plan,

12:41.304 --> 12:44.621
this whole story
he's inventing.

12:45.833 --> 12:47.560
And now he's gonna kill her.

12:48.029 --> 12:49.619
But he hasn't yet.

12:50.151 --> 12:51.565
You're the hero
in the story, Ryan.

12:51.646 --> 12:53.945
He's gonna give you the
opportunity to save her.

12:54.045 --> 12:54.973
He's made that clear.

12:55.059 --> 12:56.269
He's gonna give me
the opportunity

12:56.351 --> 12:58.116
to witness her death.

12:59.677 --> 13:01.638
Only if we let him.

13:08.604 --> 13:12.677
Move and... stay.

13:12.856 --> 13:14.958
Hmm? Good girl.

13:20.570 --> 13:21.964
Just...

13:22.797 --> 13:25.105
I'm gonna
tie around your ankles.

13:26.349 --> 13:27.297
Hey!

13:27.754 --> 13:29.401
Easy, tiger.

13:30.042 --> 13:32.428
Don't play the hero.

13:33.399 --> 13:35.764
Good man.
Hmm?

13:36.970 --> 13:38.596
Now-- unh.

13:38.776 --> 13:43.396
Oh, uh, I do realize
that this is, uh--

13:43.583 --> 13:45.593
this is something
of an imposition.

13:45.693 --> 13:49.536
We will only be requiring
your hospitality

13:49.631 --> 13:51.051
until nightfall.

14:00.728 --> 14:04.708
Ahh. What do you do
for a living, Phil?

14:04.881 --> 14:05.982
Uh, mortgage broker.

14:06.082 --> 14:08.693
Ooh. That can't be
going well.

14:09.125 --> 14:10.578
- It's picked up.
- Has it?

14:10.683 --> 14:12.198
Don't do this, Joe.

14:13.234 --> 14:14.151
Don't do what?

14:14.255 --> 14:16.340
Don't do this. Don't
terrorize them like this.

14:16.428 --> 14:19.393
This is my wife, the martyr.

14:19.481 --> 14:21.234
She takes care of everyone

14:22.522 --> 14:23.825
except me.

14:26.389 --> 14:31.758
We were having
a nice conversation, Claire.

14:36.324 --> 14:37.580
Who was that?

14:37.675 --> 14:38.929
Alex.

14:39.334 --> 14:40.704
He was checking in.
All's good.

14:41.449 --> 14:42.848
What does that mean?

14:42.955 --> 14:45.480
It means all is good, Jacob.

14:47.029 --> 14:50.330
So, what? We're just supposed
to sit here and wait?

14:50.421 --> 14:51.981
Well, we have to wait
until nightfall to leave.

14:52.064 --> 14:53.394
It's less risky.

14:53.911 --> 14:55.975
I don't--
I don't like this.

14:56.074 --> 14:58.509
Alex and everybody, they're
all on board with this?

14:59.079 --> 15:00.004
I don't like any of it.

15:00.094 --> 15:03.330
Yes, Jacob. You are the
only one who's not okay.

15:06.899 --> 15:08.738
What happened to you?
You did a 180.

15:08.828 --> 15:11.173
None of this is what I
thought it was going to be.

15:12.950 --> 15:15.861
Just what did you think
it was going to be?

15:17.870 --> 15:20.415
I thought it was
gonna be you and me.

15:35.865 --> 15:36.642
What do you got?

15:36.745 --> 15:38.096
Images of anyone
who ever visited Joe

15:38.183 --> 15:40.271
in prison or showed up
at that weapons armory,

15:40.396 --> 15:42.634
anyone who's had contact
with the cult or with Carroll.

15:42.717 --> 15:44.051
How many can you actually ID?

15:44.156 --> 15:45.380
I'm up to 50.

15:45.490 --> 15:46.604
Who's real, who's not?

15:46.695 --> 15:49.133
We got real identities,
fake, some are faceless.

15:49.210 --> 15:50.573
We don't know
who is and who isn't.

15:56.207 --> 15:57.461
Hey. Where you going?

15:59.394 --> 16:00.734
I'm standing here
with residents

16:00.830 --> 16:02.599
of Havenport, Maryland,

16:02.727 --> 16:06.827
where the FBI believe Joe Carroll
and his cult are residing.

16:06.950 --> 16:09.570
Now while many residents
have left the area,

16:09.681 --> 16:11.194
some have decided to stay.

16:11.291 --> 16:13.827
The Mayor is urging
these residents

16:13.928 --> 16:17.061
to please come
to the Hannan Recreation Center

16:17.180 --> 16:19.147
simply as a safety precaution.

16:26.452 --> 16:27.763
You think they're here?

16:28.594 --> 16:30.715
Yeah, I do.

16:39.909 --> 16:41.412
How would we know?

16:42.104 --> 16:45.641
Ma'am, are you worried that there
might be a cult lurking in your town?

16:45.776 --> 16:47.753
Oh, no. Not really.

16:47.842 --> 16:48.961
Why is that?

16:49.144 --> 16:53.173
Because the red death
spares no one.

16:53.284 --> 16:55.203
Uh, what do you mean
"read death"?

16:55.552 --> 16:59.047
"No pestilence has ever been
so fatal or so hideous.

16:59.149 --> 17:01.735
Blood was its avatar
and its seal.

17:01.852 --> 17:04.078
Darkness and decay
and the red death

17:04.185 --> 17:06.570
held dominion
over all."

17:06.867 --> 17:08.545
Ma'am, is this a quote?

17:13.217 --> 17:15.294
- What exactly are you saying?
- Death is coming.

17:23.796 --> 17:24.915
Drop it!

17:27.363 --> 17:29.598
Drop it!
Drop the knife!

17:30.050 --> 17:31.091
Drop it!

18:00.066 --> 18:02.892
- My name is Ryan--
- Ryan Hardy.

18:03.068 --> 18:04.629
Oh, I know.

18:05.760 --> 18:07.753
Okay. So you know
my name.

18:07.849 --> 18:09.255
What's your name?

18:14.460 --> 18:16.409
What? You don't want
to tell me your name?

18:18.493 --> 18:21.551
"It was many
and many a year ago,

18:21.665 --> 18:23.869
in a kingdom by the sea,

18:23.972 --> 18:25.427
that a maiden there lived

18:25.534 --> 18:26.551
whom you may know

18:26.658 --> 18:30.491
by the name
Annabel Lee."

18:31.456 --> 18:32.821
Your name is Annabel Lee?

18:32.950 --> 18:34.234
Heh heh.

18:35.633 --> 18:37.342
No, silly.

18:39.104 --> 18:41.713
Annabel Lee is the story

18:41.815 --> 18:43.390
of the death of a
woman by the sea.

18:43.485 --> 18:45.853
And the man who grieves
her death.

18:46.565 --> 18:49.581
Ryan, will you grieve
for your love

18:50.106 --> 18:52.161
when she dies?

18:52.279 --> 18:53.658
Will you?

18:53.807 --> 18:56.260
Will you lay down by her side

18:57.000 --> 19:00.859
in her tomb
by the sea? Heh heh.

19:02.034 --> 19:04.112
So it was quite a show
you put on out there

19:04.193 --> 19:05.216
with the reporter.

19:05.308 --> 19:06.277
Thank you.

19:06.390 --> 19:07.836
You know, you
killed that woman.

19:08.555 --> 19:10.063
You're welcome.

19:12.686 --> 19:14.838
You were quoting "The
Mask Of The Red Death".

19:15.132 --> 19:16.080
What was that about?

19:16.172 --> 19:18.206
Death, Ryan.
It's about death.

19:18.301 --> 19:21.348
No. See-- seen this
trick before.

19:21.730 --> 19:22.899
You're activating something,

19:22.988 --> 19:24.360
so why don't you just
tell me what it is?

19:24.449 --> 19:27.982
You. You. It was
meant for you.

19:29.298 --> 19:30.298
Heh.

19:32.795 --> 19:34.413
Okay, Annabel.

19:35.140 --> 19:37.851
How about we stop all the
creepy cult stuff, huh,

19:38.734 --> 19:41.179
and you tell me
where I find Claire?

19:41.285 --> 19:45.554
In death, there's everything.

19:50.567 --> 19:51.755
What are you doing, Ryan?

19:51.857 --> 19:53.386
Are you ready to die, Annabel?

19:54.146 --> 19:55.908
Yes!

20:02.683 --> 20:04.089
- I'm going in.
- No.

20:04.780 --> 20:06.488
- Where is she?
- Let him do it.

20:06.587 --> 20:08.780
Where is Claire?

20:09.230 --> 20:11.221
You tell me where she is.

20:11.392 --> 20:13.080
I will kill you.

20:13.677 --> 20:15.748
Claire must die.

20:16.210 --> 20:18.803
Through death, you live.

20:18.891 --> 20:20.692
Why does Joe want her dead?
What changed?

20:20.781 --> 20:22.436
In death, there is life.

20:22.583 --> 20:24.504
But something happened to Joe.

20:24.726 --> 20:27.130
What? Tell me.

20:27.232 --> 20:28.878
Why does Claire have to die?

20:28.956 --> 20:32.977
It's so you can be reborn.

21:05.210 --> 21:06.457
Dinner...

21:07.424 --> 21:08.550
nearly ready.

21:08.654 --> 21:09.961
Is he going to kill us?

21:10.051 --> 21:10.970
I'm not gonna let that happen.

21:11.061 --> 21:12.344
How are you gonna stop him?
He's crazy.

21:12.427 --> 21:13.348
I need you just to stay calm

21:13.431 --> 21:15.322
and follow my lead.
All right?

21:18.754 --> 21:19.788
What are we talking about?

21:19.887 --> 21:21.472
I was just telling
Phil and Vicky here

21:21.584 --> 21:22.945
that you're not
gonna hurt them.

21:23.035 --> 21:24.216
I promised them.

21:24.310 --> 21:26.986
Why on earth would you make
a promise you cannot keep?

21:27.103 --> 21:28.871
Well, because
they can help you.

21:28.972 --> 21:30.483
They can serve a purpose.

21:31.721 --> 21:33.027
You can give them a message,

21:33.123 --> 21:34.620
and then they can go to the FBI

21:34.719 --> 21:36.185
and speak to them.

21:37.278 --> 21:38.434
You mean, a message for Ryan?

21:38.547 --> 21:40.612
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

21:40.709 --> 21:41.824
Yeah. Tell him how
you're gonna kill me.

21:41.907 --> 21:43.286
That is the final chapter.

21:43.409 --> 21:44.173
He needs to know the plan,

21:44.268 --> 21:46.422
and these folks can be
your messenger.

21:46.508 --> 21:48.124
I've already dealt
with that, my love.

21:48.198 --> 21:50.688
Ryan knows I'm gonna kill you.

21:51.686 --> 21:55.220
Well, I've already delivered
all of my messages,

21:55.326 --> 21:59.866
and besides, Ryan is about to have--
excuse me--

22:00.050 --> 22:02.615
a very busy few hours...

22:05.045 --> 22:06.637
But I do think

22:07.263 --> 22:10.029
it is terribly sweet that you're
trying to save their lives.

22:10.119 --> 22:12.481
Oh, well. Let's eat
while it's hot, huh?

22:12.571 --> 22:14.683
I am ravenous.

22:14.968 --> 22:16.748
Oh. Phil...

22:18.400 --> 22:19.986
Parmesan?

22:28.042 --> 22:29.379
What are you doing out here?

22:29.480 --> 22:31.067
Just killing time.

22:31.742 --> 22:34.030
Because it looks like you're
thinking about leaving.

22:37.233 --> 22:39.643
Where am I gonna go, hmm,

22:40.384 --> 22:42.164
home to my dad,

22:43.371 --> 22:45.116
back to med school,

22:45.908 --> 22:47.568
prison?

23:04.412 --> 23:06.795
I hate what I've done to you...

23:10.793 --> 23:12.956
and I know we can't go back,

23:14.984 --> 23:16.817
and I'm sorry.

23:23.709 --> 23:24.834
It's okay.

23:40.343 --> 23:41.736
It's okay.

23:48.286 --> 23:50.254
You remember those--

23:50.980 --> 23:53.655
those hideous
faculty dinner parties

23:53.768 --> 23:56.011
that we had to
suffer through--

23:56.287 --> 23:59.788
boring, long, stuffy?

23:59.884 --> 24:01.327
You hated them.

24:02.092 --> 24:03.111
Ow!

24:03.750 --> 24:06.748
Joe, you're in pain.
Let me do it.

24:07.736 --> 24:08.800
Hmm.

24:10.232 --> 24:12.207
Yes, you'd have to untie me.

24:12.849 --> 24:14.092
Come on.

24:15.210 --> 24:17.590
Can I trust you,
though, Claire?

24:20.688 --> 24:22.166
What do you think, Phil?

24:22.245 --> 24:24.189
Can I trust her, huh, hmm?

24:28.305 --> 24:29.654
Let me.

24:29.967 --> 24:31.678
Yeah. Okay.

24:43.215 --> 24:44.609
Thank you.

24:47.430 --> 24:48.733
Tell me, Phil,

24:49.587 --> 24:51.421
you trust your wife, hmm?

24:53.531 --> 24:54.885
Yes, I do.

24:56.246 --> 24:57.285
Ah.

25:02.207 --> 25:03.638
Thank you.

25:04.604 --> 25:07.405
Do you love your wife?

25:08.435 --> 25:09.735
Yes, I do very much.

25:09.829 --> 25:14.696
And, uh, would you die for her?

25:14.784 --> 25:15.672
Joe, stop it.

25:15.743 --> 25:17.178
Oh, just serve
the wine, Claire.

25:17.354 --> 25:18.746
Phil?

25:21.191 --> 25:22.507
Joe.

25:22.730 --> 25:24.338
Would you...

25:24.930 --> 25:27.190
die for your wife?

25:28.302 --> 25:29.632
Yes.

25:30.148 --> 25:33.226
Yes, I would.
Plea-- please.

25:33.397 --> 25:35.777
You can kill me.

25:35.867 --> 25:37.352
You can do anything you want.

25:37.714 --> 25:39.042
Just let her go.

25:42.278 --> 25:43.920
Do you hear that, Vicky?

25:44.010 --> 25:46.627
This man would die for you.

25:46.721 --> 25:49.669
And you him, I imagine, hmm?

25:57.968 --> 26:01.075
You-- you hear
that, Claire?

26:02.403 --> 26:06.389
That is love you hear.

26:06.761 --> 26:11.721
That is marriage vows at work.

26:11.844 --> 26:14.596
You see, Claire of course
doesn't really understand

26:14.694 --> 26:16.842
the whole
"death do us part" bit,

26:16.940 --> 26:20.728
but, uh, she will, she will.

26:21.407 --> 26:23.517
Why-- why don't you
eat your food, huh,

26:23.610 --> 26:27.413
have a glass of wine,
enjoy the charming company?

26:28.131 --> 26:33.139
Because this will be
your last supper.

26:41.727 --> 26:42.998
It's the cops.

26:54.339 --> 26:55.518
Stay here.

26:57.842 --> 26:58.814
Is everything okay in there?

26:58.925 --> 26:59.862
No, no.

27:02.392 --> 27:04.834
You're gonna have to
keep very...

27:05.111 --> 27:07.980
very quiet.

27:08.941 --> 27:10.554
Sorry, ma'am. We're
doing a door-to-door

27:10.649 --> 27:11.854
to make sure all is okay.

27:11.943 --> 27:13.214
Everything's fine here.

27:13.307 --> 27:14.544
Are you home alone?

27:14.631 --> 27:17.147
It says on my registry
that Phil and Vicky...

27:17.779 --> 27:19.415
Gray live here.

27:31.487 --> 27:32.926
You shot them.

27:33.353 --> 27:34.681
They knew.

27:38.129 --> 27:40.982
Don't you move.

27:51.907 --> 27:53.200
- Ohh!
- Unh!

27:58.635 --> 28:02.081
Aah! Unh!

28:08.272 --> 28:09.380
Here.

28:10.562 --> 28:11.722
Unh!

28:16.490 --> 28:17.761
Go, go, go, go!

28:22.385 --> 28:24.010
Emma!

28:26.079 --> 28:27.407
Where are your
nearest neighbors?

28:28.207 --> 28:29.273
Through the woods.

28:32.409 --> 28:33.444
What happened?

28:34.240 --> 28:35.868
- Claire happened.
- Help me.

28:35.982 --> 28:39.056
Agh! You got to go and find her.
Find Claire.

28:39.148 --> 28:40.309
Are you sure you're okay?

28:40.394 --> 28:41.267
No. I'm fine,
I'm fine, I'm fine,

28:41.340 --> 28:42.524
but you need to take the car

28:42.706 --> 28:44.375
and hunt down my wife.

28:44.454 --> 28:45.605
But what about you?
It will be dark soon.

28:45.687 --> 28:46.825
No, no, no.
I'll be fine.

28:46.952 --> 28:49.015
I'll call Alex.
He'll come for me.

28:49.075 --> 28:50.676
- You know where to meet us, yes?
- Yes.

28:50.781 --> 28:52.446
Yes. All right.
Go, go, go, go, go.

28:52.572 --> 28:55.669
Ahh. Unh. Ohh.

28:55.993 --> 28:57.804
"Mask
Of The Red Death."

28:57.910 --> 28:59.521
Joe leaves it behind
for us to find,

28:59.614 --> 29:00.851
the girl quotes it.

29:01.164 --> 29:02.779
We keep coming back
to this story. Why?

29:02.873 --> 29:04.375
It's about a plague on a city.

29:04.545 --> 29:05.770
I mean, people that
feared death

29:05.867 --> 29:07.293
went to a palace for safety.

29:07.397 --> 29:08.703
Death found them anyway.

29:09.130 --> 29:10.717
So what are they
planning--

29:10.799 --> 29:12.466
a group suicide, a
mass murder, what?

29:12.557 --> 29:14.571
I mean, is that fitting
for Joe's final chapter?

29:14.674 --> 29:15.656
I mean...

29:16.054 --> 29:18.332
Okay. So we're
in metaphor land with Joe.

29:19.195 --> 29:21.311
If the cult is the plague...

29:21.414 --> 29:22.812
The red death...

29:22.911 --> 29:24.936
killed the people
who feared it,

29:25.046 --> 29:28.067
who sought safety and refuge,

29:29.378 --> 29:32.317
so where?

29:32.527 --> 29:34.558
Here it would be the
evacuation center.

29:40.032 --> 29:41.862
Is that possible?

29:57.996 --> 30:00.394
All right.
The evacuation center

30:00.500 --> 30:02.217
is situated in the gymnasium.

30:02.303 --> 30:04.638
We estimate there are
about 100 people inside,

30:04.725 --> 30:06.560
most of whom came in
voluntarily.

30:06.653 --> 30:08.937
There were no prescreens
or identity checks,

30:09.034 --> 30:11.439
so any number of them may be
members of Carroll's cult.

30:11.524 --> 30:12.285
So what's our approach?

30:12.370 --> 30:13.916
Let's get SWAT
posted at the exits

30:14.027 --> 30:14.907
but guns down.

30:14.993 --> 30:16.029
We don't want to start a panic.

30:16.116 --> 30:17.882
Agreed.
We do a preliminary sweep

30:18.007 --> 30:19.453
going two by two.

30:19.535 --> 30:21.347
Search for suspicious behavior.

30:21.441 --> 30:23.613
Arrest and detain anyone
out of the ordinary.

30:23.698 --> 30:25.070
We'll question them later.

30:25.522 --> 30:27.592
All right. You heard the lady.
Guns holstered.

30:27.677 --> 30:29.289
We got mostly
innocent people in there,

30:29.389 --> 30:32.974
so no shots fired unless
absolutely necessary.

30:33.361 --> 30:34.244
We clear?

30:34.343 --> 30:35.698
All right. Let's go.

30:54.007 --> 30:55.427
Keep your eyes open.

31:40.052 --> 31:41.429
Mike.

31:41.761 --> 31:44.170
Two o'clock, black
hair, black jacket.

31:44.267 --> 31:46.427
Saw him outside
the police station.

31:48.242 --> 31:49.955
Something's up with this guy.

31:52.237 --> 31:53.644
We don't want to start a panic.

32:25.524 --> 32:26.988
Ma'am, are you okay?

32:31.236 --> 32:32.742
Mike, paramedics now!

32:38.392 --> 32:40.029
- Turner!
- Aah!

32:44.348 --> 32:45.521
Go, go!

32:48.510 --> 32:49.393
Unh!

32:49.846 --> 32:50.801
Raagh!

32:56.032 --> 32:57.054
Unh!

32:58.192 --> 32:58.970
Aaaah!

32:59.935 --> 33:01.163
Hey! Hey!

33:20.195 --> 33:21.225
Hold it right there.

33:21.356 --> 33:23.847
Help, please. She
tried to kill me.

33:23.930 --> 33:25.136
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

33:25.217 --> 33:26.627
Please.

33:27.464 --> 33:28.384
Aah!

33:43.715 --> 33:45.574
Hey! Hey!

33:46.133 --> 33:47.922
That's our car.
It's them!

33:48.029 --> 33:48.951
Go, go! Run, run!

33:49.066 --> 33:50.420
Run!

33:51.476 --> 33:52.731
Unh! Ohh!

33:53.210 --> 33:54.230
Keep going.

33:55.773 --> 33:57.231
Get up, get up.
Keep going!

33:58.431 --> 33:59.624
Oh, God.

34:06.371 --> 34:07.898
Nice try, bitch.

34:07.999 --> 34:09.156
What about them?

34:09.244 --> 34:11.629
No time. Grab her.
We have to go.

34:25.206 --> 34:27.016
Check around that corner.

34:36.612 --> 34:37.969
Unh!

34:57.152 --> 34:58.113
Ohh!

34:58.677 --> 34:59.711
Argh!

35:21.735 --> 35:23.114
You found her?

35:23.292 --> 35:25.630
We did. How about you?
Any trouble getting here?

35:25.720 --> 35:27.182
No. None at all.

35:27.542 --> 35:29.655
The FBI were
completely distracted

35:29.770 --> 35:32.054
by the murder and mayhem
in town.

35:36.880 --> 35:38.779
My sweet Claire.

35:39.379 --> 35:43.140
Oh, what has
become of you, hmm?

35:44.044 --> 35:45.464
Out.

36:06.220 --> 36:07.517
Where are we going, Joe?

36:07.627 --> 36:08.712
I know you've always been fond

36:08.809 --> 36:10.378
of the open sea, Claire.

36:10.464 --> 36:11.557
We're not gonna get very far.

36:11.637 --> 36:12.556
The Coast Guard is probably

36:12.669 --> 36:13.670
already looking for us.

36:13.764 --> 36:16.078
Do you remember when we
rented that boat in Maui,

36:16.171 --> 36:18.243
just the two of us, huh?

36:18.355 --> 36:20.056
You know, we sailed for hours,

36:20.151 --> 36:21.727
we basked in the hot sun,

36:21.977 --> 36:23.188
did other things?

36:23.813 --> 36:27.433
Well, this trip won't be
like that one at all.

36:27.991 --> 36:29.480
They're patrolling
the waters, Joe.

36:29.569 --> 36:31.407
This is such a bad idea.

36:31.521 --> 36:33.585
I'll take my chances.

36:34.127 --> 36:37.007
Now all aboard.

36:39.689 --> 36:40.619
Come on!

36:42.227 --> 36:43.553
No! No!

36:43.634 --> 36:46.529
I am really
beginning to hate you.

36:46.690 --> 36:48.136
Now get inside!

36:53.439 --> 36:56.895
Joe, no. Joe! Joe!

36:57.000 --> 36:58.326
God!

37:30.227 --> 37:31.629
We have to meet Alex.
We'll be late.

37:32.304 --> 37:34.346
We don't have to go.

37:34.599 --> 37:36.230
What are you talking about?

37:36.568 --> 37:39.238
Look. We got a car,
we got a full tank of gas.

37:39.328 --> 37:40.432
I bet we could get out of town,

37:40.528 --> 37:41.981
get past the roadblocks.

37:42.576 --> 37:43.893
Jacob, why are you doing this?

37:44.004 --> 37:47.921
Look. I know that
you love Joe, okay?

37:48.136 --> 37:49.633
I love him, too.

37:50.016 --> 37:54.129
I am extremely grateful for
everything that he's done for me,

37:56.337 --> 37:59.330
but I don't want to die either.

38:00.050 --> 38:02.049
What are you talking about?

38:02.146 --> 38:03.283
We're not dying.

38:03.389 --> 38:06.895
Don't you get what
happened tonight?

38:06.986 --> 38:11.579
All those people, they just
gave up their lives for what?

38:11.664 --> 38:14.205
To be part of some book
he wrote?

38:15.913 --> 38:17.659
It didn't have to
happen that way.

38:17.758 --> 38:19.066
But that's our purpose.

38:19.161 --> 38:20.626
One day, he's gonna ask
the same thing of me,

38:20.739 --> 38:22.554
and I can't.

38:23.878 --> 38:27.859
I don't want to
die for him, Emma.

38:27.998 --> 38:30.398
I don't want you to die either.

38:34.183 --> 38:35.861
Come with me.

38:39.284 --> 38:41.600
You're really going to leave.

38:42.093 --> 38:45.063
Yeah... I am.

38:46.037 --> 38:47.651
With or without you.

38:51.059 --> 38:52.475
Hey.

38:55.566 --> 38:57.918
I love you, Emma.

39:05.676 --> 39:07.986
I love you, too, Jacob.

39:13.521 --> 39:16.069
And I love Joe.

39:24.893 --> 39:27.238
But I don't know how
to love you both.

39:29.361 --> 39:31.056
Shh.

40:12.843 --> 40:14.768
- Fine.
- Yeah. All right.

40:21.462 --> 40:22.708
You okay?

40:22.830 --> 40:24.240
Fine. What do
we got?

40:24.328 --> 40:25.703
5 civilian casualties,

40:25.801 --> 40:27.289
about a dozen or so wounded,

40:27.381 --> 40:29.775
9 cult member dead,
the rest escaped.

40:29.864 --> 40:31.588
Well, they weren't
gonna surrender.

40:31.743 --> 40:33.480
So this was just
a big distraction

40:33.593 --> 40:35.294
to, what, get
Carroll out of town?

40:35.743 --> 40:37.557
They knew all our
resources would be here.

40:37.662 --> 40:39.549
It was a perfect opportunity.

40:39.856 --> 40:41.577
Guys, we got a problem.

40:41.685 --> 40:43.089
Parker's missing.

40:47.606 --> 40:49.850
Come on.

40:52.619 --> 40:54.039
I got her feet. You
take her shoulders.

40:54.226 --> 40:55.161
No!

41:00.658 --> 41:01.870
Whoo! Ha ha!

41:07.830 --> 41:09.514
Any last words, Agent?

41:09.608 --> 41:10.437
You don't have to do this.

41:10.579 --> 41:12.033
You don't have to do this.

41:12.116 --> 41:13.413
You're right.

41:13.872 --> 41:15.176
I don't have to.

41:17.306 --> 41:18.953
Take small breaths.

41:19.931 --> 41:24.410
No! No! No!

41:25.081 --> 41:26.307
No!

41:27.204 --> 41:30.583
Help! Somebody, help!

41:30.692 --> 41:34.458
No! No! Help!

41:35.346 --> 41:36.644
Aah!

41:42.381 --> 41:44.517
Somebody, please!

41:44.869 --> 41:46.453
No!

41:47.069 --> 41:51.171
No! Somebody, help!

41:51.472 --> 41:52.859
No!

41:53.504 --> 41:54.643
No!

41:55.020 --> 41:56.242
No!

41:57.566 --> 41:58.829
No!
