WELL, RICH,
WHEN I FIRST GOT THIS JOB,

00:54.228 --> 00:56.230
I DIDN'T THINK
I COULD DO IT,

00:56.273 --> 01:01.278
CONSIDERING...THE TRAUMA
THAT I HAD ENDURED.

01:01.322 --> 01:04.064
BUT I WANTED TO HONOR
MY FATHER'S LEGACY.

01:04.107 --> 01:05.108

YOU HAVE.

01:05.152 --> 01:06.457

01:09.417 --> 01:13.029
YOUR OWN FATHER'S
SACRIFICE INSPIRED YOU.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.291

01:26.260 --> 01:28.349
YOU'VE WASTED YOUR TIME
COMING HERE.

01:28.392 --> 01:32.353
WHAT OUR FATHER DID TO
YOU, TO YOUR MOTHER

01:32.396 --> 01:34.268
WAS UNFORGIVABLE.

01:35.834 --> 01:37.967
I NEED TO TRY AND MAKE
THINGS RIGHT.

01:38.010 --> 01:42.276
MY FATHER DID SACRIFICE
HIMSELF FOR ME, AND...

01:42.319 --> 01:44.278
I'LL ALWAYS BE GRATEFUL.

01:44.321 --> 01:47.411

COMMIT SUICIDE
RIGHT BEFORE YOUR EYES,

01:52.677 --> 01:55.463
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
HARROWING.

01:55.506 --> 01:57.726
WHAT A TRUE HERO
YOUR FATHER WAS.

01:59.119 --> 02:03.297
I CAN PROVE TO YOU THAT
I'M NOTHING LIKE HIM.

02:03.340 --> 02:05.168
YOU'RE A QUEEN.

02:05.212 --> 02:07.170
ALL YOU KNOW
HOW TO DO IS LEVERAGE
YOUR OWN PRIVILEGE

02:07.214 --> 02:08.476
TO HELP YOURSELF.

02:08.519 --> 02:11.131
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU
WAS WRONG.

02:11.174 --> 02:13.220
YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN

02:13.263 --> 02:14.525
A PART OF OUR LIVES.

02:14.569 --> 02:17.224
YOU SHOULD BE A PART
OF MY LIFE NOW.

02:17.267 --> 02:18.486
WHY DO YOU THINK

02:18.529 --> 02:20.183
I WANT ANYTHING TO
DO WITH THE QUEENS?

02:20.227 --> 02:23.360
'CAUSE YOUR FAMILY
DESTROYS EVERYTHING

YOU'RE MY SISTER.

02:37.331 --> 02:39.376
I HAVE NO FAMILY.

02:44.729 --> 02:47.558
MY GOAL HAS ALWAYS BEEN
TO SERVE THIS CITY.

02:47.602 --> 02:51.736
I UNDERSTAND THAT
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO--

02:51.780 --> 02:54.739
THEY DISAGREED WITH MY
METHODS BEFORE.

02:54.783 --> 02:57.960
SO I WOULD LIKE TO ASSURE
THE PEOPLE OF STAR CITY

02:58.003 --> 03:00.919
I WILL NO LONGER BE HIDING
IN THE SHADOWS,

03:00.963 --> 03:04.401
AND I PROMISE TO ALWAYS
BE ON THE SIDE OF THE LAW.

03:04.445 --> 03:08.013
I BELIEVE THAT TRUST
CAN BE BUILT

03:08.057 --> 03:10.407
THROUGH TRANSPARENCY.

03:12.453 --> 03:14.368
AND I'M GONNA PROVE IT.

YOU WERE AMAZING.

03:23.028 --> 03:24.987
YOU WERE GENUINE AND
HEARTFELT AND AMAZING,

03:25.030 --> 03:27.381
AND FOR A SECOND THERE,
I ALMOST BELIEVED THAT
YOU LIKED LAUREL.

03:27.424 --> 03:28.556
I ALMOST DO.

03:28.599 --> 03:31.036
IF DINAH'S GOAL IS
TO CONVINCE THE CITY

03:31.080 --> 03:32.342
TO ACCEPT YOU
AS SCPD,

03:32.386 --> 03:33.996
I WOULD SAY
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

03:34.039 --> 03:35.345
WE'LL SEE.

03:35.389 --> 03:37.434
EMIKO WILL COME
AROUND, TOO.

03:38.827 --> 03:40.394
WELL, SHE HAS EVERY RIGHT
TO BE ANGRY.

03:40.437 --> 03:44.224
MY FATHER ABANDONED HER.
I JUST--

03:44.267 --> 03:46.400
I NEED HER TO SEE

03:46.443 --> 03:48.184
THAT HE AND I ARE NOT
THE SAME PERSON.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.708
WELL, SHE WILL, BECAUSE
YOU'RE NOT THE SAME PERSON.

03:50.752 --> 03:54.495
LOOK, THAT WAS
AN EXCELLENT FIRST STEP.

03:54.538 --> 03:56.236
IF YOU CAN PROVE
YOURSELF TO THE CITY,

03:56.279 --> 03:58.325
YOU CAN CONVINCE
YOUR SISTER TO
GIVE YOU A CHANCE.

03:58.368 --> 04:01.153
I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT.

04:05.854 --> 04:08.509
YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE
A.R.G.U.S. IS ASSEMBLING

AS A POTENTIAL CANDIDATE.

04:14.471 --> 04:17.257

04:25.482 --> 04:27.528
AND WHAT ABOUT
YOUR DEBT TO SOCIETY?

04:27.571 --> 04:29.399

04:29.443 --> 04:30.661

ALONGSIDE HIM.

04:30.705 --> 04:34.099
YOU'VE DEMONSTRATED
A SEVERE NEGATIVE RESPONSE

04:34.143 --> 04:35.623

05:30.373 --> 05:31.679
SO I WAS RIGHT.

05:31.722 --> 05:33.202

WE GET A HOLD OF THIS GUY,
WE CATCH DANTE,

05:50.567 --> 05:52.700

OUR BEST SHOT AT DOING THAT.

05:52.743 --> 05:54.658

FIND ALL THIS OUT?

THAT WE RESTARTED
