00:07.500 --> 00:09.370
Hey, Chyna, would you like
to pose for a painting?

00:09.410 --> 00:11.410
I'll do it!

00:11.440 --> 00:14.270
I've been looking to get back into
modeling since I gave it up two years ago.

00:16.379 --> 00:18.480
I got way too deep
into the Milan party scene.

00:31.640 --> 00:34.480
Guys! Guys! Guys!

00:34.520 --> 00:40.460
Someone saw a football player
asking directions to the Ant Farm!

00:40.490 --> 00:42.430
Everyone into the panic room!
Big kid coming! This is not a drill!

00:44.530 --> 00:46.340
Move, move, move!

00:51.350 --> 00:54.320
Angus, what are you doing?

00:54.350 --> 00:55.690
Oiling up for my modeling gig.
Do you want shirt on or shirt off?

00:55.720 --> 00:58.360
Shirt on!

01:05.570 --> 01:07.600
Great! Now we're all doomed!

01:10.310 --> 01:11.510
Might as well make
these last few seconds count.

01:11.540 --> 01:11.640
No.

01:14.920 --> 01:17.350
Guys!

01:22.460 --> 01:23.360
Huh?

01:25.660 --> 01:26.390
That dude is so tiny.

01:30.670 --> 01:32.570
That dude isn't a dude, dude.

01:34.370 --> 01:37.570
Hi, I'm Violet. I'm starting the A.
N.T. Program today.

01:37.610 --> 01:42.540
Hi! I didn't know we were getting a new Ant.
What's your talent?

01:42.580 --> 01:44.610
Name it.

01:44.650 --> 01:47.480
Football, basketball, baseball,
lacrosse, ice hockey.

01:47.520 --> 01:49.420
I also used to do
a little ultimate fighting

01:49.450 --> 01:52.390
before they added all these
"rules" about "safety."

01:53.530 --> 01:55.690
You don't look much like a football player.

01:55.730 --> 01:58.530
Oh, yeah? Hold this.

01:59.600 --> 02:01.400
Watch how I kick.

02:09.509 --> 02:14.280
Don't ever question
my football skills again!

02:14.320 --> 02:15.520
Okay! Okay.

02:17.350 --> 02:20.840
Did she say her name
was Violet, or Violent?

03:14.620 --> 03:17.320
I'm so excited about Driver's Ed.

03:17.360 --> 03:18.390
When's Ed going to get here?

03:19.660 --> 03:21.490
Do you think he's related to Phys Ed?

03:23.400 --> 03:25.500
I can't wait to get my driver's license.

03:25.530 --> 03:28.670
I'll finally be able to drive
like a real grown-up! re.

03:31.410 --> 03:35.640
Attention, everyone,
officer Darryl Parks. Police.

03:41.480 --> 03:42.480
Dad?
Yeah.

03:42.520 --> 03:43.650
What are you doing here?

03:43.690 --> 03:45.520
Teaching Driver's Ed.

03:45.560 --> 03:48.520
Because of budget cuts,
parents volunteer. ng.

03:48.560 --> 03:50.460
Right now,
the baseball field. ng.

03:53.400 --> 03:56.570
All right, so, what kind of rides we got?

03:56.600 --> 03:59.400
Convertibles with
souped-up engines?

03:59.440 --> 04:00.600
Better.

04:04.640 --> 04:09.310
Dad, I'm gonna look stupid driving
to the toy store in one of these!

04:09.350 --> 04:11.480
Sorry, the school can't afford real cars.

04:11.520 --> 04:14.320
They can't even afford a real clock.

04:21.459 --> 04:23.660
Oh! Hey, Violet, you want
us to pull up a seat?

04:23.700 --> 04:25.670
Oh, that's okay.
I'll sit over there.

04:25.700 --> 04:30.370
What? No, no, no. You do not want to do that.
That's the big kids' table!

04:30.400 --> 04:31.810
So?

04:31.840 --> 04:36.680
So, one time, Fletcher tried to just
borrow their salt and pepper...

04:36.710 --> 04:38.440
Yeah, and what happened?

04:44.450 --> 04:45.420
Where's the salt?

04:46.490 --> 04:49.620
You don't want to know.

04:49.660 --> 04:54.360
Anyway, lately things between the Ants and
the big kids have been surprisingly calm.

04:54.390 --> 04:57.500
So just try not to provoke
them, especially Lexi Reed.

04:57.730 --> 05:00.500
That's "her seat."

05:00.530 --> 05:01.630
Oh, I get it.

05:01.670 --> 05:03.600
Oh, good.

05:03.640 --> 05:07.270
You guys are too gutless
to stand up for yourselves.

05:07.310 --> 05:09.440
Well, I'm going to sit where I want.

05:09.480 --> 05:12.580
And if Lexi messes with me, I'll
slap the spray tan right off of her.

05:16.680 --> 05:19.380
What do you think you're doing?

05:19.420 --> 05:20.550
What does it look like, blondie?

05:20.590 --> 05:21.650
Eating my lunch.

05:22.560 --> 05:26.290
Um, why are you making eycontact with me?

05:26.330 --> 05:29.590
You don't even have an eye
contact permission request.

05:32.470 --> 05:35.600
Look, you better move along or you'll
be making eye contact with my fist!

05:38.570 --> 05:40.440
Chyna, do something.

05:40.470 --> 05:42.510
Here, Lexi, let me
pack up your lunch to go.

05:48.710 --> 05:50.620
You got hummus in my purse!

05:50.650 --> 05:52.450
Actually, it looks like baba ghanoush.

05:56.490 --> 05:58.460
Mmm-hmm,
I taste the eggplant.

06:00.730 --> 06:03.630
Hey, Lexi.

06:03.660 --> 06:07.470
I see you've met Violet.
She's a spunky one, isn't she?

06:08.600 --> 06:10.600
What is her problem?

06:10.640 --> 06:13.270
Well, it's her fir...

06:13.310 --> 06:15.640
Wait, here's my eye contact
permission request.

06:19.440 --> 06:20.340
Thank you.

06:22.480 --> 06:26.350
It's her first day.
So just give her a chance.

06:26.380 --> 06:29.390
Look, I need no distractions,
because this is a big week for me.

06:29.420 --> 06:32.420
As you well know, I'm dancing the lead
in the ballet recital this Friday.

06:33.690 --> 06:36.630
I did not know that.

06:36.660 --> 06:39.500
Didn't see it in my newsletter,
<i>The Lexi Reed-All-About-It?</i>

06:42.500 --> 06:45.670
Oh, sorry I forgot to submit
my subscription renewal.

06:46.570 --> 06:48.470
Oh!

06:51.610 --> 06:53.610
Thank you.

06:53.650 --> 06:58.520
Anyway, from now on, you are personally
responsible for keeping her away from me.

06:58.550 --> 07:00.490
Why me?

07:00.520 --> 07:02.520
Because for some reason,
the other Ants look up to you.

07:02.560 --> 07:05.320
So keep that animal under control,

07:05.360 --> 07:10.090
because I have a mean side and
you guys do not want to see it.

07:12.460 --> 07:13.940
We haven't seen it?

07:19.000 --> 07:21.930
We have to do something
about Lexi and Violet.

07:21.970 --> 07:23.600
Lexi's the queen bee of the big kids,

07:23.630 --> 07:25.900
and if you mess with the queen bee, she's
going to send the whole hive after us.

07:25.940 --> 07:28.170
Actually, interesting factoid...

07:33.010 --> 07:35.980
The queen bee does not
directly control the hive.

07:36.010 --> 07:38.950
In fact, when her pheromone
production diminishes,

07:38.980 --> 07:40.050
the worker bees cuddle her to death.

07:42.180 --> 07:45.190
My grandma Dottie almost
did the same thing to me.

07:48.060 --> 07:50.060
Well, we're never going to change Lexi.

07:50.090 --> 07:53.090
But maybe we can find
a way to calm Violet down.

07:53.130 --> 07:55.000
You know what always
calms me down? Art.

07:55.030 --> 07:57.130
My aroma therapist, Art Strickler.

08:00.130 --> 08:04.770
Wait, what about actual art?

08:04.810 --> 08:08.810
We could use our talents.
You could try art, I could try music,

08:08.840 --> 08:12.180
and Olive can lull her to sleep
with interesting factoids.

08:14.950 --> 08:18.090
Actually, interesting factoid
about interesting factoids...

08:22.830 --> 08:24.090
See? Isn't this relaxing?

08:24.130 --> 08:25.890
By the way, that's a beautiful horse.

08:28.160 --> 08:30.970
This is a picture of my grandmother!

08:34.970 --> 08:36.940
Are you saying my grandmother
looks like a horse?

08:40.210 --> 08:42.110
No.

08:42.140 --> 08:44.150
Then you're saying I'm a bad painter?

08:45.850 --> 08:46.880
No!

08:46.920 --> 08:48.850
Then what are you saying?

08:55.060 --> 08:57.960
Art, clear your schedule.
I'm going to need all of Wednesday.

09:01.960 --> 09:06.130
Listen to this song, Violet.
It's been known to charm deadly cobras.

09:20.920 --> 09:21.250
Can I see that?

09:21.280 --> 09:23.080
Of course!

09:28.020 --> 09:28.990
I hate the flute.

09:33.930 --> 09:35.900
She turned my flute into a triangle.

09:38.930 --> 09:42.200
That's the... The only instrument
I don't know how to play.

09:49.980 --> 09:52.080
Hi, Violet!

09:52.110 --> 09:55.080
Would you like to help me with this
crossword puzzle? It's very calming.

09:56.220 --> 10:00.120
Sure, Olive. That sounds
like a new and fun challenge.

10:00.150 --> 10:05.060
Okay, let's just put away your knife shoes.

10:10.100 --> 10:15.000
All right, I'm looking for a
six-letter word, that begins with S

10:15.030 --> 10:18.940
and ends in I-D, and means
"Lacking in intelligence."

10:19.240 --> 10:22.940
Hmm, I'm not sure.

10:22.970 --> 10:23.940
Stupid!

10:25.040 --> 10:27.080
Who are you calling stupid?

10:29.080 --> 10:31.920
Oh, no, no, no, it's just the
answer to the clue. "Stupid."

10:33.190 --> 10:35.950
Are you calling me stupid again?

10:35.990 --> 10:37.120
No, don't be stupid...

10:38.190 --> 10:38.990
Okay that time I did call you stupid.

10:46.070 --> 10:48.200
I want you to be careful with these cars.

10:48.240 --> 10:50.240
They belong to my
four-year-old niece, Ashley,

10:50.270 --> 10:53.170
and she's already had
three accidents in them.

10:53.210 --> 10:54.010
Two poops and a pee.

10:57.180 --> 11:01.980
Remember, don't go too fast,
and watch out for pedestrians.

11:02.020 --> 11:04.920
Ooh! My dad is a pedestrian!
And my mom is a Capricorn.

11:09.920 --> 11:12.960
You know what?
Let's practice braking.

11:12.990 --> 11:15.130
Ooh! I'm really good
at breaking. Check this out.

11:23.140 --> 11:24.940
That's not how you brake.

11:25.870 --> 11:29.010
This is how you break. Hey!

11:46.230 --> 11:51.070
Well, everyone's different.
Maybe exercise calms Violet down.

12:01.950 --> 12:02.050
I'm off to ballet.

12:04.150 --> 12:07.820
Ballet? She's taking ballet?
Lexi's in ballet.

12:07.850 --> 12:10.850
What are we going to do?

12:10.890 --> 12:12.960
I don't want to interrupt here, but
my shoe is filling with blood.

12:16.130 --> 12:21.830
Violet, are you sure you
want to take ballet?

12:21.870 --> 12:26.070
Actually, a lot of football players take ballet.
It really improves balance.

12:26.100 --> 12:28.140
My coach says I'm a little unstable.

12:31.980 --> 12:34.040
I bet a lot of people say that.

12:35.980 --> 12:39.050
What are we going to do?

12:39.080 --> 12:40.880
Violet is headed straight into
the middle of a hornets' nest!

12:40.920 --> 12:42.950
Fletcher, keep your metaphors straight.

12:42.990 --> 12:45.090
Is Lexi a queen bee or a hornet?

12:45.120 --> 12:46.920
They're very different.

12:46.960 --> 12:49.090
Like hornets can sting
multiple times, while bees...

12:51.030 --> 12:53.260
Wow, I actually just bored myself.

12:56.900 --> 13:00.970
Look. We just need to figure out a way to
keep Violet from provoking Lexi during dance.

13:01.010 --> 13:02.970
How are we going to do that?
None of us take ballet.

13:11.050 --> 13:13.120
Oh, no.

13:20.120 --> 13:25.060
Uh, you know, Fletcher,
boys don't wear tutus.

13:25.090 --> 13:29.000
Man! You couldn't have told me that
before I went into the dressing room?

13:29.030 --> 13:32.230
Next thing you're going to tell me is
that I don't need my hair in this bun.

13:41.910 --> 13:43.970
Hey, guys!

13:44.010 --> 13:46.810
Angus, what are you doing here?

13:46.840 --> 13:48.910
I've been in ballet for years.

13:48.950 --> 13:51.880
Where else can I be in a room
with a bunch of babes in tights?

13:54.850 --> 13:56.990
Plus, I'm awesome.

14:07.970 --> 14:11.900
Scoot over, blondie. I want to get
some pull ups in before rehearsal.

14:14.810 --> 14:20.780
Chyna! I told you to keep that
little sociopath away from me.

14:20.810 --> 14:22.110
Excuse me, I'm standing right here.

14:26.120 --> 14:28.820
I was talking about Violet.

14:28.850 --> 14:31.750
Look, this ballet recital
is my moment to shine,

14:31.790 --> 14:33.860
and if you or that maniac Violet
ruin this for me, I will...

14:36.030 --> 14:38.060
Aw!

14:39.000 --> 14:39.860
I look so pretty!

14:44.840 --> 14:48.170
Oh. Sorry, my beauty distracted
me from finishing my threat.

14:51.910 --> 14:53.910
Look. Don't worry.
I'm all over this.

14:53.940 --> 14:56.010
You won't even know Violet's here.

14:56.050 --> 14:58.820
All right! Who's ready
to play some ballet?

14:58.850 --> 15:02.850
Let's win this thing!
No pain, no gain!

15:05.860 --> 15:09.030
Chyna!

15:09.060 --> 15:12.800
Oh, look! Who's that
beautiful girl in the mirror?

15:14.870 --> 15:17.030
Aw, pretty!

15:35.060 --> 15:37.860
Is there a problem, Officer?

15:37.890 --> 15:40.060
You did not come to a full
stop near the water fountain.

15:41.100 --> 15:44.100
I'm so sorry!

15:45.930 --> 15:48.840
I'm just having one of those days.

15:48.870 --> 15:53.040
My orange juice this morning had pulp in
it, and my cereal had milk in it, and...

15:53.070 --> 15:57.040
All right, all right, all right,
all right, stop crying.

15:58.850 --> 15:59.180
I'll let you off with a warning.

15:59.210 --> 16:01.050
Thank you!

16:13.060 --> 16:17.000
Stop! You were doing five
in a two-and-a-half.

16:21.770 --> 16:24.840
I'm so sorry! I was...

16:24.870 --> 16:25.840
Doing that thing that Paisley
said she was doing!

16:27.840 --> 16:29.980
Stop crying and be a man!

16:30.010 --> 16:33.010
All right, fine.
Give me your fake ticket.

16:33.050 --> 16:35.920
Oh, this isn't fake.
The school is raising money to buy a clock.

16:48.900 --> 16:51.800
What are you looking at?
You've never seen a lily pad before?

16:54.100 --> 16:56.840
This is it.
The end of the road.

16:56.870 --> 17:00.010
Wait, I have an idea.

17:00.040 --> 17:02.950
I don't know why
I didn't think of it sooner.

17:02.980 --> 17:03.910
We quit school and get married?
Ooh, can I be a bridesmaid?

17:06.880 --> 17:08.720
How would that even help us?

17:08.750 --> 17:10.020
Married people live longer.
Statistically, he's correct.

17:10.050 --> 17:11.119
We're not getting married!

17:13.089 --> 17:14.920
I'm just going to go try
and reason with her.

17:14.960 --> 17:17.130
Tell her violence isn't the answer.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.960
Boy, my fiancee comes up
with the craziest plans.

17:26.770 --> 17:30.070
Hey, I was wondering
if I could ask you a question.

17:30.110 --> 17:31.110
Sure.

17:34.980 --> 17:36.850
You-seem-really-tightly-wound-
and-we-were-wondering...

17:36.880 --> 17:38.150
If-you-could-possibly-
chill-out-a-little- please-don't-hit-me.

17:40.880 --> 17:43.890
Look, I... I'd love
to chill out, but I can't.

17:43.920 --> 17:48.020
You probably haven't noticed,
but I have slight anger issues.

17:48.060 --> 17:53.800
Oh, really? I hadn't noticed at all.
What are you so angry about?

17:53.830 --> 17:55.960
You want to know what
I'm angry about? Yes.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.800
You want to know what I'm angry about?

17:57.830 --> 17:58.930
A little less so, but okay.

18:01.140 --> 18:03.000
I'll tell you what I'm angry about!

18:05.040 --> 18:07.010
Well, I have a crush
on this super cute boy.

18:09.950 --> 18:13.980
I really "like him" like him, but I'm
not sure if he "likes me" likes me.

18:14.020 --> 18:16.820
I don't know who it is, but I'm
sure he "fears you" fears you.

18:20.060 --> 18:22.960
I don't know why
I just said that. Go on.

18:22.990 --> 18:26.790
If you tell anyone, I'll tear out
your tongue and slap you with it!

18:28.030 --> 18:29.930
But it's Fletcher.
He's so cute!

18:32.940 --> 18:36.940
Hold off. Fletcher?
Fletcher Quimby?

18:36.970 --> 18:39.070
The only guy I know
who actually owns a loom?

18:41.080 --> 18:44.080
Yes. He's so sensitive.

18:44.110 --> 18:48.950
And not knowing how he feels
about me makes me so angry!

18:48.980 --> 18:52.820
If he liked me, I would be the
happiest girl on the football team.

18:52.860 --> 18:53.920
Happy? You'd be happy?

18:56.130 --> 18:57.830
No, he does not like you.

18:59.160 --> 19:02.000
He loves you.
He "loves you" loves you.

19:03.130 --> 19:07.870
I love you, too, Fletcher!

19:07.900 --> 19:09.900
What?

19:09.940 --> 19:14.040
Fletcher, tell her how much you love her.

19:14.080 --> 19:15.910
Can't... Breathe...

19:18.080 --> 19:19.810
See? You take his breath away.

19:22.880 --> 19:24.850
This is Grandma Dottie all over again.

19:33.030 --> 19:35.830
Hey, babe.
Prepare to taste burnt plastic.

19:38.900 --> 19:40.730
Hey! You just
ran a red light!

19:40.770 --> 19:42.900
Try to catch me, copper!

19:47.870 --> 19:48.770
Man, I wish this thing had a siren.

19:52.980 --> 19:56.020
While you guys are racing, I'm
going to listen to my stereo!

20:15.170 --> 20:18.170
Look at Lexi and Violet on the same
stage, dancing together so peacefully.

20:19.110 --> 20:21.010
Good work, Chyna!

20:21.040 --> 20:23.980
Well, what can I say?
I'm a problem solver.

20:31.080 --> 20:34.820
Now this next part makes no sense to me.

20:34.850 --> 20:37.120
When the swan presents her prince with
the egg, he thanks her with a kiss.

20:38.090 --> 20:43.130
I would much prefer
a cheeses-of-the-world basket.

20:43.160 --> 20:48.030
There is no way I'm letting my man
kiss that pathetic piece of poultry!

20:50.900 --> 20:52.970
What are you doing?

20:53.010 --> 20:54.870
I'm giving this to Fletcher.

20:54.910 --> 20:55.940
Oh, no.

20:57.150 --> 20:58.880
Give me that egg!

20:58.910 --> 21:01.920
No. Fletchie, I'm ready
for my kiss. Catch!

21:03.050 --> 21:04.150
Ooh, interception!

21:05.050 --> 21:05.920
Ha! Nice try!

21:07.120 --> 21:09.160
Fumble!

21:11.790 --> 21:14.000
Here, Angus! Pass it to me!

21:14.030 --> 21:14.930
No! To me!

21:16.970 --> 21:19.130
Angus hands off to Olive.

21:19.170 --> 21:22.140
I don't want it!
And she laterals to Chyna!

21:26.110 --> 21:28.910
Come on, lily pads!
All out blitz!

21:31.150 --> 21:32.980
Let's go, swans!
Let's get them!

21:33.010 --> 21:36.980
Okay, wait. Guys.
Guys! Timeout! Timeout!

21:37.020 --> 21:40.850
There are no timeouts remaining!
This game is coming down to the wire!

21:42.990 --> 21:44.790
All right. Down, set.

21:44.830 --> 21:46.130
Do what they're doing!

21:47.930 --> 21:49.170
Hut one, hut two, and...

21:49.200 --> 21:51.800
Yikes!

21:56.110 --> 21:59.080
Chyna going down to the ten, to the five!

21:59.110 --> 22:01.850
She could go all the way!

22:20.100 --> 22:21.900
Come on!

22:21.930 --> 22:23.170
This was supposed to be my moment!

22:28.080 --> 22:29.780
Oh, good.

22:29.810 --> 22:30.910
Ballet parking.

22:41.150 --> 22:45.120
Lexi, I'm really sorry about what happened,

22:45.160 --> 22:47.790
so I got you a present.

22:47.830 --> 22:49.890
If you think a present is
going to make up for...

22:52.030 --> 22:52.930
Aw!

22:55.200 --> 22:56.200
Pretty...

22:59.010 --> 23:01.110
Ooh! Olive!
 Hi!

23:02.070 --> 23:04.350
Have you seen my little Fletchie?

23:04.350 --> 23:06.350
Uhh...

23:10.290 --> 23:11.960
No. I haven't seen him.

23:12.160 --> 23:14.900
Do not make me get my knife shoes...

23:14.900 --> 23:16.780
He's in the panic room.

23:16.980 --> 23:18.180
