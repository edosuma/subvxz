WEBVTT

00:02.733 --> 00:04.400
Previously on
"Hit The Floor"...

00:04.433 --> 00:05.733
Boston wants me
to dance for them.

00:05.767 --> 00:07.233
I think a change
would be good.

00:07.267 --> 00:08.467
For both of us.

00:08.500 --> 00:10.500
I'll sign, but I have
one more condition.

00:10.533 --> 00:12.533
Ahsha has to come back
to the Devil Girls.

00:12.567 --> 00:14.400
Will you marry me?
Yes!

00:14.433 --> 00:16.900
Lionel, you don't want to
make an enemy of me.

00:16.933 --> 00:18.633
I married Oscar.

00:18.667 --> 00:20.300
You don't want to
make an enemy of me.

00:20.333 --> 00:21.600
You set me up.

00:21.633 --> 00:24.067
Jackson is in and we have
a partner to help us

00:24.100 --> 00:25.633
buy the team.

00:25.667 --> 00:28.567
Kinkades have owned
the Devils for over 25 years.

00:28.600 --> 00:29.600
I mean, who would
have the balls

00:29.633 --> 00:30.733
to try to
steal it away?

00:32.133 --> 00:33.333
Something came up
in my physical.

00:33.367 --> 00:34.467
I have to see
a doctor tomorrow.

00:34.500 --> 00:35.767
It's my heart.

00:35.800 --> 00:37.367
You made a deal
to make a movie for

00:37.400 --> 00:38.700
a producer
you never met.

00:38.733 --> 00:39.900
If it wasn't for
the $5 million budget--

00:39.933 --> 00:41.400
$5 million?

00:41.433 --> 00:44.067
If you thought confession
your secret gay life

00:44.100 --> 00:45.233
was going to
bond us...

00:45.267 --> 00:46.700
Dad, I--
I don't have a son.

00:46.733 --> 00:48.400
You won't be with me
the way I want,

00:48.433 --> 00:50.267
but you don't want
me with anyone else.

00:50.300 --> 00:51.433
I got that.

00:51.467 --> 00:52.933
Oscar Kinkade.

00:52.967 --> 00:55.300
You're under arrest for
the murder of Mia Sertner.

00:55.333 --> 00:56.567
I'm the lead witness for

00:56.600 --> 00:58.133
the prosecution in
his murder trial.

00:58.167 --> 01:00.067
I just want you
to be safe.

01:00.067 --> 01:01.067
Sloane?

01:01.067 --> 01:02.667
I have to go.

01:02.700 --> 01:03.600
Love you.

01:24.267 --> 01:25.433
Hello?

01:25.467 --> 01:26.433
Hello?

01:26.467 --> 01:27.367
Damn it!

01:48.800 --> 01:50.367
I'd love two bedrooms

01:50.400 --> 01:52.667
with a space for a ballet
barre and a view of the pond.

01:53.867 --> 01:55.667
Babe, this is Boston.

01:55.700 --> 01:58.800
We can afford a one-bedroom
with space for a hotplate

01:58.833 --> 02:00.667
and a view of
a neighbor's bathroom.

02:00.700 --> 02:02.933
Well, as long as you're
with me, it's perfect.

02:07.233 --> 02:08.433
Lionel?

02:08.467 --> 02:09.833
"Come to my
office now."

02:11.200 --> 02:13.233
Only thing missing is
a whistle and a dog biscuit.

02:14.600 --> 02:15.867
What could she want?

02:15.900 --> 02:17.133
I have no idea.

02:25.733 --> 02:27.400
You're at it early.

02:27.433 --> 02:29.067
We've got a plan
to buy the team

02:29.067 --> 02:31.900
and a partner to
help us raise the cash.

02:31.933 --> 02:33.367
Now we need to raise
our profile.

02:36.567 --> 02:38.067
We're having a party.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:38.067 --> 02:39.767
Jackson was pretty clear
about keeping our plan

02:39.800 --> 02:41.200
to buy
the Devils on the DL.

02:41.233 --> 02:42.900
And we will.

02:42.933 --> 02:45.933
This party is to
announce our engagement.

02:45.967 --> 02:47.767
We're coming out as
a power couple.

02:47.800 --> 02:49.867
Jackson's bringing
all his friends to fawn.

02:51.300 --> 02:52.200
God, I love you.

02:55.067 --> 02:56.400
So where is
this party at now?

02:56.433 --> 02:57.933
That's the best part.

02:57.967 --> 02:59.700
The Devils'
playground.

02:59.733 --> 03:02.200
Right inside
Devils Arena.

03:02.233 --> 03:03.133
The theme?

03:05.500 --> 03:07.467
Masquerade.
Mmm...

03:07.500 --> 03:09.900
Who doesn't get turned on
by a covert affair?

03:11.300 --> 03:12.567
I do.
Oh, yeah?

03:12.600 --> 03:13.967
Mm-hmm.

03:14.067 --> 03:16.300
What about...
a little of that?

03:18.067 --> 03:19.600
I'll give you
a covert affair.

03:19.633 --> 03:21.800
Terrence, your leg,
baby, your leg!
Covert affair you.

03:21.833 --> 03:23.767
You're only about
three pounds, come on.

03:29.933 --> 03:31.467
I don't know who
you think you are--

03:31.500 --> 03:32.400
You're
a Devil Girl again.

03:33.700 --> 03:34.800
Yay.

03:36.600 --> 03:38.133
You want me back?

03:38.167 --> 03:39.333
No.

03:39.367 --> 03:41.233
Not at all, actually.

03:41.267 --> 03:42.433
Jelena?

03:42.467 --> 03:44.700
I can see you've been
taking standup classes

03:44.733 --> 03:46.233
during your time away.

03:46.267 --> 03:48.267
No.

03:48.300 --> 03:49.200
This is Derek.

03:50.867 --> 03:52.467
It's a condition
of his contract,

03:52.500 --> 03:54.867
so go dust off your
pom-poms.

03:56.267 --> 03:57.667
We're done here.

03:57.700 --> 03:59.433
Actually, we're not.

04:00.967 --> 04:02.667
I have
a condition, too.

04:02.700 --> 04:03.867
You have a condition?

04:03.900 --> 04:05.867
Boston's offering me
choreography,

04:05.900 --> 04:07.067
and I'm not
turning it down unless

04:07.067 --> 04:09.067
I get the same
chance here.

04:09.100 --> 04:10.133
Fine.

04:10.167 --> 04:12.633
Jelena's never shared
choreography before.

04:12.667 --> 04:14.467
She's not
gonna like it.

04:14.500 --> 04:15.400
I'll handle Jelena.

04:17.300 --> 04:18.300
Great.

04:18.333 --> 04:20.767
I'll go dust off
my pom-poms, then.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.100
Derek will be
ecstatic.

04:24.900 --> 04:26.500
Hopefully your boyfriend
will feel the same way.

04:34.533 --> 04:35.733
Hypertrophic--

04:35.767 --> 04:38.400
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

04:38.433 --> 04:40.333
What is that?

04:40.367 --> 04:44.100
It's a thickening of
the left ventricular heart wall.

04:44.133 --> 04:45.967
It's also referred to as
an enlarged heart.

04:47.367 --> 04:48.900
It's progressive.

04:48.933 --> 04:50.867
As it worsens,
the heart becomes weaker

04:50.900 --> 04:52.733
and less able to
pump blood.

04:52.767 --> 04:54.700
Not the heart.

04:54.733 --> 04:55.633
My heart.

04:58.267 --> 04:59.533
Oh, my God.

04:59.567 --> 05:00.900
We caught it early.

05:00.933 --> 05:02.100
With medication
and lifestyle changes,

05:02.133 --> 05:03.300
you can lead a completely--

05:03.333 --> 05:04.367
I have a child.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.733
His father is
out of the picture.

05:05.767 --> 05:06.933
There's no way
in hell I'm--

05:06.967 --> 05:08.567
Raquel, let
the man finish!

05:08.600 --> 05:11.200
He's trying to tell you
we caught it in time.

05:11.233 --> 05:13.833
What kind of
lifestyle changes?

05:13.867 --> 05:15.433
A healthier diet.

05:15.467 --> 05:18.067
And cutting down on stress
and strenuous activity.

05:19.733 --> 05:20.767
I'm a Devil Girl.

05:20.800 --> 05:22.233
My job is
strenuous activity.

05:22.267 --> 05:26.200
Raquel, I'm afraid
being a Devil Girl,

05:26.233 --> 05:29.100
with that kind of
dancing, it's just not possible.

05:29.133 --> 05:30.233
With the right
medication...

05:31.600 --> 05:32.500
I'm sorry.

05:40.967 --> 05:42.500
Okay, guys,
let's get to it.

05:46.933 --> 05:48.467
You're back.

05:48.500 --> 05:50.333
I never left.

05:50.367 --> 05:51.933
Fantastic.

05:51.967 --> 05:53.200
All right, time's money.

05:53.233 --> 05:54.200
Let's break
into three.

05:54.233 --> 05:55.800
Set offense,
give-and-go.

05:55.833 --> 05:57.567
Actually,
I'm calling drills.

05:59.067 --> 06:00.500
I'm captain.

06:00.533 --> 06:01.967
Actually, I'm captain.

06:02.067 --> 06:04.200
Contracts can be
so tricky.

06:04.233 --> 06:05.667
The give-and-go
sounds great, though.

06:05.700 --> 06:06.800
Let's go.

06:06.833 --> 06:07.900
Give-and-go.

06:07.933 --> 06:09.133
Practice hard,
let's go.

06:14.467 --> 06:17.100
I want servers
there, there and there.

06:19.200 --> 06:21.900
Make sure we extend the stage
a little bit for the dance.

06:21.933 --> 06:23.933
This will be
the VIP section.

06:23.967 --> 06:25.067
I want a full bar.

06:25.067 --> 06:26.200
All top shelf.

06:26.233 --> 06:28.067
None of the cheap stuff,
and I'll know.

06:29.167 --> 06:30.267
I don't see
my name anywhere.

06:32.867 --> 06:33.767
And you won't.

06:36.067 --> 06:37.467
Some big names here.

06:37.500 --> 06:39.300
Which should have
been your first clue.

06:39.333 --> 06:40.733
Pretty ballsy,
choosing the playground.

06:42.200 --> 06:44.300
If I was trying to buy
the Devils

06:44.333 --> 06:46.367
out from under
the Kinkades' noses,

06:46.400 --> 06:48.833
I don't think I'd have
the cojones to host

06:48.867 --> 06:50.200
a meet-and-greet
in their own living room.

06:51.367 --> 06:53.867
This is an
engagement party.

06:53.900 --> 06:55.567
Which I'm sure kills you
to hear.

06:55.600 --> 06:56.500
Engaged?

06:58.300 --> 06:59.633
Congrats.

06:59.667 --> 07:00.700
You can keep her.

07:00.733 --> 07:02.233
And your secret.

07:02.267 --> 07:04.067
You know what, I'll even keep
it for you as a wedding gift.

07:04.067 --> 07:05.567
All right, whatever
little story

07:05.600 --> 07:07.933
you've concocted
in your head--
What do you want?

07:07.967 --> 07:10.300
A token of your
appreciation.

07:10.333 --> 07:14.067
If you're able to
pull off buying the team,

07:14.067 --> 07:15.500
you just have to do
one thing for me.

07:16.900 --> 07:17.867
Trade Derek.

07:19.800 --> 07:21.833
You are
out of your mind.

07:21.867 --> 07:24.567
Entirely possible,
yet here we are.

07:26.267 --> 07:29.133
It's way past time
that I beat your ass.

07:29.167 --> 07:31.100
You're welcome to try.

07:31.133 --> 07:33.233
But it won't
change a thing.

07:33.267 --> 07:35.600
Agree to trade Derek and I'll
keep my mouth shut.

07:35.633 --> 07:38.200
If not, I'll blow
you out of the water.

07:40.600 --> 07:41.500
See you at the party.

07:44.933 --> 07:47.300
This is Sloane,
leave me a message.

07:47.333 --> 07:48.600
Sloane?

07:48.633 --> 07:50.833
Hey, I thought we were having
breakfast this morning.

07:50.867 --> 07:51.767
Give me a call.

08:07.400 --> 08:08.667
You sleep?

08:08.700 --> 08:09.600
Do you care?

08:11.200 --> 08:13.633
The longer I'm gone,
the more people will miss me.

08:13.667 --> 08:14.933
Like Pete?

08:14.967 --> 08:16.600
He called.

08:16.633 --> 08:17.633
And...

08:19.067 --> 08:20.400
You're fine.

08:20.433 --> 08:23.800
Spending...
some time at the spa.

08:25.900 --> 08:26.800
Problem solved.

08:30.933 --> 08:31.833
You work for Oscar.

08:33.133 --> 08:34.233
I do.

08:40.300 --> 08:41.800
Are you gonna
kill me?

08:41.833 --> 08:42.733
No.

08:44.100 --> 08:45.267
You're going to
kill yourself.

08:55.167 --> 08:56.133
What's that for?

08:56.167 --> 08:57.267
Your suicide note.

08:58.633 --> 08:59.433
I'm not writing that.

08:59.467 --> 09:00.767
You can
and you will.

09:02.767 --> 09:03.667
Pick up the pen.

09:24.133 --> 09:25.233
Good.

09:27.167 --> 09:28.367
"I can't
outrun the past.

09:31.067 --> 09:32.567
"This guilt won't
leave me alone.

09:34.100 --> 09:37.200
"What I've done,
I can't undo.

09:37.233 --> 09:39.567
All I can do is
beg for forgiveness."

09:44.333 --> 09:45.467
Don't forget to
sign it.

09:58.200 --> 10:00.933
You could not have hooked up
with a bigger loser.

10:00.967 --> 10:02.300
This isn't about me.

10:02.333 --> 10:04.900
This is about Zero's
rivalry with Derek.

10:04.933 --> 10:05.967
And now we're
dragged into it.

10:07.433 --> 10:09.233
We don't have to be.

10:09.267 --> 10:10.733
Derek is
set for life

10:10.767 --> 10:12.733
no matter what team
he plays for.

10:12.767 --> 10:14.800
Are you saying you'd be
okay with trading Derek?

10:16.467 --> 10:19.000
I wouldn't be okay
with it, but...

10:19.033 --> 10:20.067
I'd do it for us.

10:20.100 --> 10:21.233
That's not gonna happen.

10:23.533 --> 10:27.333
Part of being the boss
is making tough decisions,

10:27.367 --> 10:28.900
not letting emotions
get in the way.

10:28.933 --> 10:30.433
There is a line,
Jelena.

10:33.167 --> 10:34.667
I will not do
Derek like that.

10:37.500 --> 10:39.333
There has to be another
way to deal with Zero.

10:42.400 --> 10:43.500
I'll handle it.

10:55.833 --> 10:56.733
What did Lionel want?

10:59.800 --> 11:00.800
To give me
my job back.

11:03.133 --> 11:04.567
What?

11:04.600 --> 11:05.967
You're leaving
and settling?

11:06.067 --> 11:07.500
She doesn't
want you to go?

11:07.533 --> 11:08.433
No.

11:11.067 --> 11:12.933
She wanted to
close Derek's deal

11:12.967 --> 11:14.767
and he asked her
to do it.

11:18.700 --> 11:21.167
I told her she had to
meet Boston's terms.

11:21.200 --> 11:22.233
I got choreography.

11:22.267 --> 11:23.367
Derek's deal.

11:25.567 --> 11:27.167
Everyone knows
I wanted to come back.

11:27.200 --> 11:28.633
You would have done
the same if you could.

11:34.133 --> 11:35.067
Did you already
take the job?

11:37.100 --> 11:38.700
Yeah... I did.

11:40.500 --> 11:43.367
But I wouldn't unless you
could get your job back, too.

11:43.400 --> 11:45.600
I talked to Pete, and it's
there if you wanted it.

11:47.567 --> 11:48.700
I wanted
a fresh start.

11:50.600 --> 11:52.067
We both did.

11:52.067 --> 11:53.267
Baby.

11:53.300 --> 11:56.067
LA has the best team
in basketball,

11:56.067 --> 11:58.067
for me and for you.

11:58.100 --> 11:59.067
This is
a good thing.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.100
I get it.

12:04.133 --> 12:05.067
This is
a good thing.

12:07.300 --> 12:08.400
Good.
But...

12:09.833 --> 12:12.267
Ahsha...

12:12.300 --> 12:14.067
I'm not gonna
stay here

12:14.067 --> 12:15.167
just to watch
you get caught up

12:15.200 --> 12:17.533
with Derek Roman again,

12:17.567 --> 12:19.433
to watch you
fall in love with him.

12:22.833 --> 12:23.733
I can't.

12:26.233 --> 12:27.133
And I won't.

12:29.700 --> 12:30.800
This is about
dancing.

12:32.100 --> 12:33.067
Derek's the past.

12:34.367 --> 12:35.500
I'm with you.

12:37.333 --> 12:38.600
Just as long as we both
understand that.

12:38.633 --> 12:39.400
We do.

12:39.433 --> 12:40.533
Of course we do.

12:56.800 --> 12:58.100
Ahsha's back on
the Devil Girls.

13:04.467 --> 13:05.733
I must have heard
you incorrectly.

13:05.767 --> 13:08.233
I thought you
said Ahsha's back.

13:08.267 --> 13:09.733
I'm sure that
you're not thrilled.

13:11.633 --> 13:13.700
I'm sure you know
we had a deal.

13:13.733 --> 13:17.300
Unfortunately, my deal
with Derek Roman was--

13:17.333 --> 13:18.467
Well, there
was a bigger deal.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.900
Ahsha has no place
dancing on this team.

13:22.933 --> 13:24.067
She never has.

13:24.067 --> 13:25.333
She won't
just be dancing.

13:25.367 --> 13:26.600
She'll be choreographing
with you as well.

13:28.133 --> 13:29.667
That's not possible.

13:29.700 --> 13:32.767
Jelena, it's in the best
interest of the Devils.

13:32.800 --> 13:34.400
I know you
don't care for her.

13:34.433 --> 13:35.867
I don't either.

13:35.900 --> 13:37.867
But in business, you can't
let emotion get in the way.

13:46.700 --> 13:48.733
Hey, I e-mailed
the producer, Franklin,

13:48.767 --> 13:51.200
invited him to Jelena's
party, and guess what?

13:51.233 --> 13:52.500
He is coming.

13:52.533 --> 13:53.667
Driving in from
Phoenix for it.

13:53.700 --> 13:56.133
I am finally
gonna meet this guy.

13:56.167 --> 13:57.633
What are you gonna
say to him?

13:57.667 --> 14:00.100
The bigger question is,
why are you in pajamas?

14:00.133 --> 14:01.067
Where am I going?

14:03.267 --> 14:04.900
I know you're upset.

14:04.933 --> 14:07.600
You got some news--
It's not some news.

14:07.633 --> 14:09.233
It's a heart
condition.

14:09.267 --> 14:10.233
Which they caught early.

14:13.533 --> 14:15.300
There's no sense
in hiding out here.

14:15.333 --> 14:16.433
You have your whole
life ahead of you

14:16.467 --> 14:17.567
to do whatever you want.

14:18.800 --> 14:20.200
What do you
want to do?

14:20.233 --> 14:21.133
Be a Devil Girl.

14:27.233 --> 14:29.600
I was a dancer,
then a mom.

14:29.633 --> 14:31.500
I-- I did
everything so young,

14:31.533 --> 14:33.133
I never really thought about
the next thing, you know?

14:34.567 --> 14:36.300
Maybe it's
time to start.

14:36.333 --> 14:37.833
I don't want to.

14:37.867 --> 14:39.067
How's that?

14:39.067 --> 14:41.567
I want to sit at home
in a crappy T-shirt

14:41.600 --> 14:44.633
and crappy sweatpants
and just feel crappy.

14:44.667 --> 14:45.900
You can have this
pity party for one,

14:45.933 --> 14:48.400
because I refuse to
feel bad for you.

14:48.433 --> 14:50.767
Kyle, you just
made me a sandwich.

14:56.467 --> 14:59.100
You can either let this
knock you down,

14:59.133 --> 15:00.100
or you can fight.

15:03.567 --> 15:05.133
You're a Devil Girl whether
you're dancing or not.

15:06.533 --> 15:07.767
Start acting like one.

15:21.500 --> 15:22.900
You're late.

15:22.933 --> 15:25.300
The guards were under
the horrifying impression

15:25.333 --> 15:27.600
that this was
a conjugal visit.

15:27.633 --> 15:28.833
I couldn't let them know
this was a marriage

15:28.867 --> 15:30.933
based in blackmail, so...

15:30.967 --> 15:32.133
I just told them
you were impotent.

15:37.433 --> 15:38.633
You're cranky.

15:38.667 --> 15:39.933
The league trying
to separate me

15:39.967 --> 15:41.600
from my team
will do that.

15:41.633 --> 15:43.067
I would think you'd have
more important things

15:43.067 --> 15:44.633
to worry about.

15:44.667 --> 15:47.067
Like a murder trial
for the death of a dancer.

15:49.267 --> 15:50.300
I'm not concerned
about that.

15:52.200 --> 15:53.233
You know
something I don't?

15:53.267 --> 15:54.167
Always.

15:55.667 --> 15:56.933
You're gonna have to
do what I say

15:56.967 --> 15:58.467
if I'm gonna keep
the league at bay,

15:58.500 --> 16:00.067
starting with signing
Derek Roman.

16:01.433 --> 16:02.933
Done.

16:02.967 --> 16:03.867
Really?

16:05.433 --> 16:06.767
How did you
avoid paying him

16:06.800 --> 16:09.067
the ridiculous amount
he was asking for?

16:09.100 --> 16:10.400
I didn't.

16:10.433 --> 16:11.700
He got it.

16:11.733 --> 16:14.067
Every penny,
and then some.

16:14.067 --> 16:15.367
Where'd you get
the money?

16:15.400 --> 16:16.300
I liquidated an asset.

16:17.900 --> 16:19.300
I sold the Hollywood Arena
development.

16:21.067 --> 16:23.233
You did-- you...

16:23.267 --> 16:24.300
You did what?

16:24.333 --> 16:26.067
You weren't
entirely forthcoming

16:26.067 --> 16:28.133
about where all your
money was stashed.

16:28.167 --> 16:29.733
I needed the cash.

16:29.767 --> 16:31.500
I didn't get nearly as much
as you sunk into it,

16:31.533 --> 16:34.333
but a dead body tends
to depreciate things.

16:34.367 --> 16:35.700
That development project

16:35.733 --> 16:38.333
was in the works
for over a decade.

16:38.367 --> 16:39.900
What can I say?

16:39.933 --> 16:41.400
Thanks.

16:41.433 --> 16:43.367
You are entirely
too glib right now.

16:46.433 --> 16:48.700
You have made me
very unhappy.

16:48.733 --> 16:50.100
Read between
the lines, Oscar.

16:51.500 --> 16:53.367
Your happiness no longer
concerns me.

16:54.800 --> 16:56.433
You're not worried
about your murder trial,

16:56.467 --> 16:58.100
but the league is.

16:58.133 --> 17:00.633
If we're gonna keep
the league at bay,

17:00.667 --> 17:02.133
I need to cut you out.

17:04.067 --> 17:06.767
You can't cut me out
of my own team.

17:06.800 --> 17:07.933
I can and I have.

17:17.633 --> 17:19.900
You won't ever have to
wait for me again.

17:19.933 --> 17:21.700
I won't be
coming back.

17:21.733 --> 17:22.933
Take care, Oscar.

17:29.467 --> 17:31.667
Five, six, seven, eight.

17:31.700 --> 17:32.833
And one, two.

17:34.400 --> 17:36.067
Tighter, people.

17:36.067 --> 17:36.933
Pivot.

17:39.533 --> 17:41.067
Keep it together.

17:41.067 --> 17:42.067
Ahsha?

17:42.100 --> 17:43.067
Ahsha's back.

17:49.133 --> 17:51.133
This dance is for
the masquerade.

17:51.167 --> 17:52.567
Your engagement party.

17:52.600 --> 17:53.700
I'm honored
to be there.

17:54.867 --> 17:56.067
It's already
choreographed.

17:56.100 --> 17:57.233
No problem.

17:57.267 --> 17:58.267
I'll get
the next one.

18:04.433 --> 18:06.333
I don't think I need
to pass you anything.

18:14.367 --> 18:15.267
Spill it.

18:17.967 --> 18:19.967
Oscar wants to see me.

18:20.067 --> 18:22.500
I know why,
Lionel froze him out.

18:22.533 --> 18:24.600
He's looking for
a way back in.

18:24.633 --> 18:26.067
You're still
considering?

18:26.100 --> 18:28.233
I'm curious
what he has to say.

18:29.633 --> 18:31.067
Um...

18:31.067 --> 18:32.233
Do you want me to
drive you there?

18:35.367 --> 18:36.967
No, I'm good.

18:37.067 --> 18:38.900
Okay.

18:38.933 --> 18:42.233
But if you do go,
just be prepared.

18:42.267 --> 18:43.367
For what?

18:43.400 --> 18:45.533
For anything.

18:45.567 --> 18:48.067
Caged animals
are unpredictable.

18:48.067 --> 18:49.367
That's what Oscar
is right now.

18:51.167 --> 18:53.800
Whatever he's got in mind,
you need to be ready.

19:09.867 --> 19:11.733
You won't kill me.

19:11.767 --> 19:13.633
You can't.

19:13.667 --> 19:14.933
Or else you
would have already.

19:16.400 --> 19:17.633
You have no power
over me.

19:17.667 --> 19:18.567
Maybe I don't.

19:20.133 --> 19:21.367
Maybe somebody else
could help me out.

19:24.567 --> 19:25.467
Ahsha, that's her
name, right?

19:28.633 --> 19:29.600
Maybe I should
look her up.

19:29.633 --> 19:30.533
Don't you dare.

19:57.867 --> 19:58.967
Knock, knock.

20:01.367 --> 20:02.267
Is that my hoodie?

20:03.667 --> 20:04.567
I came to
see my man.

20:05.967 --> 20:08.100
Who I love
very much.

20:08.133 --> 20:10.500
Did I come to
the right place?

20:10.533 --> 20:11.600
Yes, you did.

20:13.167 --> 20:14.167
Good.

20:15.567 --> 20:16.467
I wanted to...

20:19.800 --> 20:20.933
... show him
something.

20:24.800 --> 20:26.600
It's activated.

20:26.633 --> 20:27.533
And so am I.

20:35.233 --> 20:36.500
Sloane Hayes' room,
please.

20:38.167 --> 20:40.400
Yeah, this is
the spa she always goes to.

20:40.433 --> 20:42.267
Can you double-check that,
see if she checked in?

20:44.367 --> 20:45.267
Okay, thank you.

20:55.267 --> 20:57.767
While I believe that everyone
is innocent

20:57.800 --> 20:59.900
until proven guilty,

21:00.067 --> 21:02.933
it's my job to do
what's best for the Devils.

21:02.967 --> 21:05.567
And in this case, that means
cutting ties

21:05.600 --> 21:06.633
with Oscar Kinkade.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.067
As long as
he's under suspicion,

21:10.067 --> 21:13.367
he will have nothing to do with
this organization.

21:13.400 --> 21:16.433
Devils Nation will
always be my top priority.

21:23.133 --> 21:24.400
Jude, I'm glad you came.

21:29.500 --> 21:31.200
It's remarkable
how things change.

21:33.067 --> 21:34.700
One minute, I'm celebrating

21:34.733 --> 21:36.133
my team winning
the title.

21:36.167 --> 21:38.967
Next...
I'm behind bars.

21:40.233 --> 21:41.700
You were doing everything
you could

21:41.733 --> 21:43.733
to get inside
Devils Arena,

21:43.767 --> 21:45.700
and now
you're an EVP.

21:45.733 --> 21:46.633
You've come a long way.

21:48.167 --> 21:49.867
For Lionel to give you
that title,

21:49.900 --> 21:51.833
you must have
really earned her trust.

21:51.867 --> 21:53.300
I knew this was going to
be about Lionel.

21:54.900 --> 21:56.567
That's why
I'm here, you need me.

21:56.600 --> 21:58.067
Jude, settle down.

21:58.067 --> 22:00.067
I'm not gonna
settle down.

22:00.067 --> 22:02.667
The last words
you said to me were,

22:02.700 --> 22:03.733
"I don't have a son."

22:05.933 --> 22:07.067
Do you think
it's strange

22:07.067 --> 22:09.067
you haven't
brought that up at all?

22:09.067 --> 22:11.733
If you thought
I only wanted to use you,

22:11.767 --> 22:12.967
why did you come?

22:13.067 --> 22:14.100
To give you this.

22:16.967 --> 22:18.100
You do have
a son.

22:21.367 --> 22:22.800
This is him.

22:22.833 --> 22:24.300
That's me.

22:24.333 --> 22:26.367
Until you're ready to
acknowledge that,

22:26.400 --> 22:27.800
we have
nothing to talk about.

22:49.300 --> 22:50.433
All right, attention, attention.

22:50.467 --> 22:52.100
Can I have your
attention, please?

22:52.133 --> 22:54.067
All right, welcome to
the engagement party for

22:54.067 --> 22:58.133
Mr. Terrence Edward Wall
and Miss Jelena Howard.

22:58.167 --> 23:00.333
Look, let me be
the first to congratulate them.

23:00.367 --> 23:02.333
Bro, I wish you a lifetime
of happiness.

23:04.400 --> 23:05.733
All right, let's get
Miss Thing out here.

23:05.767 --> 23:07.300
Put your hands together for
the Devil Girls,

23:07.333 --> 23:09.200
who, if you ask me,

23:09.233 --> 23:10.667
are looking
better than ever.

25:25.867 --> 25:26.833
Well, hello.

25:32.267 --> 25:33.933
You called me here
to accept my offer?

25:33.967 --> 25:34.867
No.

25:36.633 --> 25:38.300
You should know better than
to play hardball with me.

25:39.533 --> 25:40.733
Instead of opening up
what could have been

25:40.767 --> 25:41.800
a fruitful negotiation,

25:41.833 --> 25:44.500
you pissed me off,
so I'll make you a deal.

25:44.533 --> 25:46.367
Keep your mouth shut
about our plans

25:46.400 --> 25:47.933
or suffer the consequences

25:47.967 --> 25:49.567
when we finally
do buy the team,

25:49.600 --> 25:51.167
and we will,

25:51.200 --> 25:52.467
whether you open
your mouth or not.

25:54.600 --> 25:56.267
People run around
afraid of you.

25:57.933 --> 25:58.900
I'm not one
of those people.

26:00.600 --> 26:02.900
I let you walk all over me
when we were together,

26:02.933 --> 26:04.933
because...
I wanted you.

26:06.600 --> 26:08.833
Now all I want is to
make you suffer.

26:11.067 --> 26:12.633
This is the way
to do it.

26:12.667 --> 26:13.767
'Cause either
way you lose.

26:16.133 --> 26:17.333
It sucks,
doesn't it?

26:18.733 --> 26:20.067
Deal stands.

26:20.067 --> 26:21.067
Derek for my silence.

26:31.200 --> 26:32.300
Here we go, champ.

26:38.800 --> 26:40.233
Some dance.

26:40.267 --> 26:41.733
Wouldn't have been in it
if it weren't for you.

26:43.100 --> 26:44.767
What you
did for me?

26:44.800 --> 26:46.333
Getting my job back?

26:46.367 --> 26:47.467
Was a really
nice thing to do.

26:48.900 --> 26:50.667
Thank you, Derek, for being
such a good friend.

26:53.133 --> 26:54.333
I don't want to
be your friend.

27:18.167 --> 27:19.067
I wrote it.

27:30.100 --> 27:31.067
How are we
gonna do it?

27:45.867 --> 27:46.767
What are those?

27:49.100 --> 27:50.067
Enough.

27:59.133 --> 28:00.100
Let me see
the letter.

28:02.367 --> 28:03.567
What do you think,
the longer you hold onto it,

28:03.600 --> 28:04.767
the longer you can
delay this?

28:07.867 --> 28:08.767
Come on.

28:32.600 --> 28:33.667
This is insane,
Sloane.

28:33.700 --> 28:35.400
Are you okay?
I'm fine.

28:35.433 --> 28:36.933
He's dead,
Oscar is dead!

28:36.967 --> 28:38.700
Oscar's going to jail
for a long time.

28:38.733 --> 28:40.067
I'm gonna
make sure of that.

28:40.100 --> 28:41.500
Really, I'm fine,
let's go.

28:50.500 --> 28:52.433
You look like
you're hunting prey.

28:52.467 --> 28:53.767
I am.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.833
My movie producer
is around here somewhere,

28:55.867 --> 28:57.733
behind one of
these masks.

28:57.767 --> 28:58.900
Ow!

29:06.200 --> 29:07.433
Well, damn.

29:07.467 --> 29:09.433
So... what'd I miss?

29:09.467 --> 29:10.367
Hmm.

29:12.067 --> 29:13.300
Zero is unpredictable.

29:14.900 --> 29:16.100
And he's
fixated on Derek.

29:16.133 --> 29:17.433
He has been from the day
he got here.

29:19.067 --> 29:21.700
If agreeing to trade
Derek is our only option--

29:21.733 --> 29:22.967
It's not
an option at all.

29:24.833 --> 29:25.933
Terrence.

29:27.600 --> 29:28.667
Your party's
a big success.

29:28.700 --> 29:29.867
Great.

29:29.900 --> 29:32.133
Maybe... we have
enough support

29:32.167 --> 29:33.900
to let people know we're
making a play for the team.

29:35.133 --> 29:36.533
Yeah, why not announce
it tonight?

29:36.567 --> 29:37.633
I'll tell you why.

29:37.667 --> 29:39.633
It'll undo everything
we've done.

29:39.667 --> 29:41.800
The media will
start scrutinizing you,

29:41.833 --> 29:43.067
undermining you.

29:43.100 --> 29:45.567
Potential investors aren't
looking for that,

29:45.600 --> 29:47.067
and neither am I.

29:47.067 --> 29:50.133
Lionel just cut ties with
Oscar in a very public way.

29:50.167 --> 29:53.433
It was a brilliant move and
not great timing for us.

29:53.467 --> 29:55.767
Unless you want to
blow this before it's begun,

29:55.800 --> 29:57.167
now is not the time
to go public.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.200
Franklin.
Mm-mm.

30:08.533 --> 30:09.433
Franklin.

30:16.633 --> 30:17.900
Franklin.
Kyle.

30:20.200 --> 30:21.367
Beau?

30:21.400 --> 30:23.067
What are you--
Did you always
look this good?

30:23.100 --> 30:24.000
Yes.

30:25.567 --> 30:26.700
I'm looking for
Franklin.

30:26.733 --> 30:27.633
You found him.

30:29.933 --> 30:31.000
You're...

30:31.033 --> 30:32.267
This doesn't make any sense.

30:32.300 --> 30:34.000
Since when are you
a movie producer?

30:34.033 --> 30:36.067
Since I learned how much
money you can make off it.

30:38.467 --> 30:40.967
I'm gonna need you to walk
me through this real slow.

30:42.133 --> 30:43.967
It's pretty simple,
actually.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.700
Raised five million
from a bunch of dopes

30:45.733 --> 30:47.767
looking to be in
the movie biz.

30:47.800 --> 30:49.433
Spend a million.

30:49.467 --> 30:50.500
Pocket the rest.

30:50.533 --> 30:51.700
What's in it
for them?

30:51.733 --> 30:54.067
I promised them each
50% of the profits.

30:56.133 --> 30:58.500
I don't know where
you learned math,

30:58.533 --> 31:01.300
but 50% can only be
split between two people.

31:03.600 --> 31:05.467
What's 50%
of nothing?

31:05.500 --> 31:08.533
If I make a crappy movie,
no one will go see it.

31:08.567 --> 31:11.367
No profits means I get
to keep all the money.

31:11.400 --> 31:12.300
Beau.

31:13.567 --> 31:15.533
Conning innocent people,
that is not our style.

31:15.567 --> 31:17.633
Well, none of the people I do
business with are innocent.

31:20.400 --> 31:21.633
No.

31:21.667 --> 31:24.233
No one's putting out a piece
of crap with my name on it.

31:24.267 --> 31:25.167
Not even you.

31:27.100 --> 31:28.233
You want in
for half?

31:29.733 --> 31:31.133
Of $4 million?
Yeah.

31:34.333 --> 31:35.767
Let's make a bomb.

31:50.067 --> 31:51.133
How'd it go with Oscar?

31:53.900 --> 31:55.067
How'd you
know I went?

31:56.967 --> 31:58.067
He wants a stooge.

31:59.433 --> 32:01.200
I'm not gonna let him
use me like that.

32:01.233 --> 32:03.167
I'm not gonna
be an afterthought.

32:04.967 --> 32:06.600
I can't even imagine you
being an afterthought.

32:08.267 --> 32:10.067
I think about you
first all the time.

32:19.067 --> 32:20.633
You're the most screwed-up
person I've ever met.

32:24.933 --> 32:26.667
You're the only person
that makes me feel normal.

33:28.633 --> 33:29.533
Great, thank you.

33:31.633 --> 33:32.833
Cops are fingerprinting
the place.

33:32.867 --> 33:34.433
They will
find something.

33:34.467 --> 33:36.067
No.

33:36.067 --> 33:37.133
They won't.

33:37.167 --> 33:38.433
I'm moving in.

33:38.467 --> 33:39.767
And moving Ahsha out,

33:39.800 --> 33:41.267
just in case Oscar
tries to get to her.

33:42.900 --> 33:43.933
I'm also gonna hire someone
to look after you

33:43.967 --> 33:45.333
when I'm not around.

33:45.367 --> 33:47.167
Oscar is not getting
another crack at you.

33:49.500 --> 33:50.400
Sloane,
you hear me?

33:51.967 --> 33:53.300
You will be safe.

34:05.800 --> 34:06.900
I think I'm wearing
your underwear.

34:08.233 --> 34:09.133
That's fine.

34:14.067 --> 34:15.500
I missed you...
Jude.

34:17.300 --> 34:18.200
I missed you, too.

34:20.267 --> 34:22.167
Should I leave first
or should you?

34:25.833 --> 34:26.933
What?

34:26.967 --> 34:28.733
Oh, what did I do?

34:28.767 --> 34:30.233
It's not what you did,
it's what I did.

34:30.267 --> 34:31.667
What I keep doing.

34:31.700 --> 34:32.733
Nothing's changed.

34:32.767 --> 34:33.800
It's the same
old story.

34:33.833 --> 34:34.800
What are you
talking about?

34:34.833 --> 34:36.600
I'm still your secret.

34:36.633 --> 34:38.067
Something you
have to hide.

34:38.067 --> 34:39.833
You're being dramatic.

34:39.867 --> 34:42.233
We're literally
in a closet together.

34:46.600 --> 34:49.067
Unless you have something new
to offer me, leave me alone.

34:52.967 --> 34:54.200
If you care
about me at all...

34:56.367 --> 34:57.267
... stay away.

35:17.867 --> 35:19.767
Jackson, hello.

35:19.800 --> 35:21.633
Lionel.

35:21.667 --> 35:22.900
I haven't
seen you since--

35:22.933 --> 35:24.300
Since you were
separated from Pete.

35:25.900 --> 35:27.733
I heard about
the divorce.

35:27.767 --> 35:28.933
So sorry.

35:30.633 --> 35:31.933
I know I hurt you.

35:31.967 --> 35:33.200
It was never
my intention.

35:33.233 --> 35:35.900
No, listen, you got
exactly what you needed.

35:35.933 --> 35:37.633
Pete Davenport was
your soul mate.

35:39.867 --> 35:41.300
And here you are,
remarried already.

35:43.133 --> 35:45.167
Another soul mate,
I'm sure.

35:48.167 --> 35:50.567
Congratulations on all
your success, Lionel.

35:56.800 --> 35:57.900
This model is
lightweight.

35:59.600 --> 36:01.867
Smooth recoil.

36:01.900 --> 36:03.200
Easy to conceal.

36:04.833 --> 36:06.933
Background check
takes about ten days,

36:06.967 --> 36:08.833
and three to four months
for the license.

36:08.867 --> 36:10.433
I can't wait
that long.

36:10.467 --> 36:12.600
I need it now.

36:12.633 --> 36:13.600
For protection.

36:19.833 --> 36:21.233
I can maybe help
you out,

36:21.267 --> 36:22.633
but...
it won't be cheap.

36:23.933 --> 36:25.067
Or legal.

36:29.067 --> 36:30.100
Whatever it takes.

36:36.967 --> 36:39.333
Evening, everyone.

36:39.367 --> 36:42.567
I wanted to take this
opportunity to say a few words

36:42.600 --> 36:43.600
about our host.

36:46.500 --> 36:48.367
Terrence and Jelena

36:48.400 --> 36:51.767
are the definition
of a power couple,

36:51.800 --> 36:54.500
with lofty goals
for the future.

36:54.533 --> 36:56.067
Thank you for that.

36:58.167 --> 36:59.733
Terrence and I
are thrilled...

37:02.500 --> 37:03.467
Okay.
Okay?

37:07.133 --> 37:08.233
If we're able
to buy the team,

37:08.267 --> 37:09.367
then we'll trade
Derek.

37:14.433 --> 37:15.333
Great.

37:34.467 --> 37:35.500
Excuse me.

37:37.600 --> 37:39.900
I heard you were
amazing in that dance.

37:39.933 --> 37:41.300
You're amazing
in that dress.

37:43.933 --> 37:45.067
I look the part.

37:45.100 --> 37:46.267
Now I just have to
be the part.

37:48.100 --> 37:49.767
We never got to
dance together.

37:53.567 --> 37:54.733
There.

37:54.767 --> 37:56.533
We danced together.

37:56.567 --> 37:58.667
If someone had to take my
spot, I'm glad it was you.

38:02.433 --> 38:03.833
I heard from Kyle that
your coming back

38:03.867 --> 38:05.400
was thanks to Derek.

38:05.433 --> 38:07.267
It would make sense if that
stirred up some emotions.

38:08.567 --> 38:09.667
I'd maybe be
careful with him.

38:11.067 --> 38:12.367
I can handle Derek.

38:14.067 --> 38:15.267
I was talking about
German.

38:37.133 --> 38:38.267
Ahsha looked
happy out there.

38:39.433 --> 38:40.567
That's what she
looks like happy.

38:42.333 --> 38:43.433
Maybe you just
never seen it.

38:44.800 --> 38:46.167
I want to be really clear

38:46.200 --> 38:47.433
so there's no weird
confusion between us.

38:49.833 --> 38:51.200
I'm coming for her.

39:20.333 --> 39:22.333
Next on "Hit The Floor"...

39:22.367 --> 39:23.400
Pack your bags, Ahsha.

39:23.433 --> 39:24.500
You're going to
Vegas.

39:24.533 --> 39:25.933
You're
staying here, too?

39:25.967 --> 39:27.367
Lionel's having
a huge media event.

39:27.400 --> 39:28.933
Of course the Roman emperor
is gonna be part of it.

39:28.967 --> 39:29.867
You want me to
blow on 'em for luck?

39:34.133 --> 39:35.833
You refuse to get it
and you never will.

39:35.867 --> 39:36.800
I love you.

39:38.567 --> 39:40.133
Oscar's coming at Sloane.

39:40.167 --> 39:41.700
There's not much that
I can do to stop it.

39:41.733 --> 39:43.367
We're making a play
to buy the team.

39:43.400 --> 39:45.267
And we need
your help to do it.

39:45.300 --> 39:47.067
Prepare yourself, Jude.

39:47.067 --> 39:47.967
This is about to
get ugly.
