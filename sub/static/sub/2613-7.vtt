00:21.902 --> 00:24.772
(Crossing bell rings)
- Come on, come on, come on!

00:40.295 --> 00:42.371
No!

00:52.182 --> 00:54.507
Paramedics pronounced 20 minutes ago.

00:54.643 --> 00:56.018
Megan Treadwell.

00:56.144 --> 00:57.687
I ran her plates

00:57.813 --> 00:59.936
33 tomorrow.

01:01.066 --> 01:03.771
One-on-one with a train.

01:03.902 --> 01:06.476
What did she think that she could beat it?

01:11.827 --> 01:13.072
Hey.

01:14.955 --> 01:16.663
Door handle

01:16.790 --> 01:19.791
Point of impact: Passenger side door.

01:19.918 --> 01:22.077
Dead centre

01:22.212 --> 01:24.039
Question is...

01:24.172 --> 01:26.414
why did the SUV cross the track s?

01:26.550 --> 01:27.925
To get to the other side.

02:13.764 --> 02:16.681
Sheriff says we're holding up trains
all over the country.

02:16.808 --> 02:19.346
The railroad depends
on keeping the main line open.

02:19.478 --> 02:21.517
We can't take this back to the garage.

02:21.647 --> 02:25.894
Yeah, well, unfortunately, his priority
is clearing this train from these track s.

02:26.026 --> 02:27.686
You have two hours.

02:28.862 --> 02:30.321
Well, where are you going?

02:30.447 --> 02:33.483
Suspicious circs in town. This one's all yours.

02:33.617 --> 02:35.526
Thanks, but you gotta give me some guys.

02:35.661 --> 02:37.487
Sara's all you get.

02:37.621 --> 02:39.613
All I need.

02:39.748 --> 02:41.741
(Bell rings continuously)

02:46.755 --> 02:48.380
Burglary-in-progress call.

02:48.507 --> 02:51.461
Once we made entry,
we found the victim downstairs.

02:54.221 --> 02:56.344
Never knew this place existed.

02:56.473 --> 02:58.964
The Western States Historical Society.

02:59.101 --> 03:00.809
It's not on a lot of tourist maps.

03:01.937 --> 03:05.187
(Bell stops)
- I had them cut the wires.

03:05.315 --> 03:07.522
We need to identify
the source of the alarm, Ray.

03:07.651 --> 03:10.023
Security company said it was downstairs.

03:10.153 --> 03:12.146
The body's there too.

03:17.035 --> 03:20.155
Trying to get them
to turn some more lights on in here.

03:20.289 --> 03:22.696
There are no more lights, O'Riley.

03:22.833 --> 03:27.744
It's a controlled environment. Notice how you're
not sweating? It's probably 66 degrees in here.

03:27.879 --> 03:30.964
35% relative humidity
Too much light too much heat

03:31.091 --> 03:32.882
degrades the book s.

03:33.010 --> 03:35.679
What? Nobody's got a key?

03:35.804 --> 03:38.260
The curator's across town. He's on his way.

03:38.390 --> 03:40.679
She looks dead to me.

03:49.484 --> 03:52.022
You got first touch.

04:04.750 --> 04:06.125
10:48.

04:07.711 --> 04:09.620
Red foam. Blue tint.

04:11.131 --> 04:13.124
The foam could be from blood in her lungs.

04:14.051 --> 04:17.052
Oedema The skin is cyanotic

04:17.178 --> 04:19.385
Maybe a blood disease. Leukaemia, meningitis.

04:19.514 --> 04:21.257
We'll know more after the post

04:34.154 --> 04:36.692
Hey, don't do that.

04:36.823 --> 04:37.903
Excuse me?

04:38.033 --> 04:40.441
These are very rare book s.

04:41.745 --> 04:43.405
Aaron Pratt

04:43.538 --> 04:47.370
Librarian. Only other person here
when the alarm sounded.

04:47.501 --> 04:49.908
Did he tell you what he was doing here?

04:50.045 --> 04:52.536
Oh, yeah. Watching her.

04:53.674 --> 04:55.880
Set off the alarm trying to get in the cage.

04:56.009 --> 04:58.381
(Faltering) I wasn't watching her.

04:58.512 --> 05:02.130
I always say good night to Veronica

05:02.266 --> 05:08.518
because I have to leave at 8:03
to catch the 8:10 bus.

05:08.647 --> 05:09.975
It's three blocks away.

05:10.107 --> 05:14.401
And sometimes the bus comes at 8:08,

05:15.529 --> 05:18.198
so I have to rush to catch it.

05:18.282 --> 05:21.485
So you went down to the basement
to say good night?

05:23.078 --> 05:24.987
"Good night, Veronica."

05:25.122 --> 05:26.664
"Good night, Aaron."

05:27.833 --> 05:31.533
Sometimes she walks me to the bus.

05:33.213 --> 05:35.170
Did she walk you to the bus tonight?

05:36.300 --> 05:38.091
"Are you coming?"

05:38.218 --> 05:41.005
"No, you go ahead without me.

05:41.138 --> 05:43.130
I nave more work to do"

05:46.560 --> 05:48.552
Then...

05:49.730 --> 05:51.438
...a Uniball pen

05:51.565 --> 05:55.432
rolled across the desk

05:55.569 --> 05:58.605
fell onto the chair

05:59.740 --> 06:02.065
nit the floor

06:02.200 --> 06:04.573
and stopped rolling at the wastebasket

06:07.122 --> 06:09.115
Then water...

06:11.585 --> 06:14.372
...water falls

06:14.504 --> 06:17.042
into her eyes.

06:18.800 --> 06:20.627
You mean she was sweating?

06:22.304 --> 06:24.629
From her forehead.

06:24.765 --> 06:26.757
Lots

06:28.852 --> 06:32.850
And then she grabs her stomach

06:32.981 --> 06:35.140
with both hands.

06:40.656 --> 06:42.648
"Aaron."

06:45.702 --> 06:48.869
Then she put on her... new face.

06:51.667 --> 06:53.410
Shelley's Frankenstein.

06:54.962 --> 06:57.120
Up and down,

06:57.255 --> 06:59.047
flopping around like

06:59.174 --> 07:02.875
a salmon on my uncle's fishing boat

07:06.807 --> 07:08.799
She was convulsing?

07:08.934 --> 07:10.808
I...

07:10.936 --> 07:13.059
couldn't help her

07:13.188 --> 07:16.771
because the cage is locked
and I don't have a key.

07:16.900 --> 07:22.239
Hey there.
Warrick's got three residential burglaries, so...

07:23.949 --> 07:26.784
Mr Pratt, will you excuse me for a moment?

07:29.621 --> 07:33.951
According to O'Riley,
this guy's body language says he's guilty.

07:34.084 --> 07:35.578
I think he's autistic.

07:35.711 --> 07:39.162
Autistic? What, you mean like Rain Man?

07:39.298 --> 07:41.967
Rain Man was a savant, extremely rare.

07:42.050 --> 07:47.008
Aaron Pratt is a high-functioning autistic man
with superior right-brain abilities.

07:47.139 --> 07:48.882
Kinda sounds like you.

07:50.058 --> 07:52.051
The crime scene's in the basement.

07:58.108 --> 08:00.646
Man, I hate rushing through a crime scene.

08:00.777 --> 08:05.523
Two years from now, no-one is gonna care
the Sheriff turned this into a scoop-and-run.

08:05.657 --> 08:07.566
The call was made above our heads.

08:07.701 --> 08:10.026
Just document the time in your notes.

08:10.162 --> 08:12.201
- I'll let you testify on this one.
- Thanks.

08:12.331 --> 08:13.576
(Dog bark s)

08:15.250 --> 08:17.243
Hey, little guy.

08:21.214 --> 08:23.006
Let's see.

08:23.133 --> 08:25.173
His name is Maverick.

08:25.302 --> 08:28.303
Lives on Martingale Street in Henderson.

08:28.430 --> 08:30.636
That's not that far from here.

08:30.766 --> 08:33.008
- Guess I'll go call Animal Control.
- OK

08:33.143 --> 08:35.135
I'll be right back.

08:37.898 --> 08:39.558
Come on, boy. Let's get you home.

08:39.691 --> 08:42.857
So all you saw
was a car trying to beat the signal?

08:42.986 --> 08:45.524
I'm puttin' 55 miles an hour. It's dark.

08:45.656 --> 08:47.814
I got an oil leak. Can't figure out where.

08:47.950 --> 08:49.610
I looked up and I saw something.

08:49.743 --> 08:50.906
The SUV.

08:51.036 --> 08:53.871
Like I said, it was dark. I thought it was stopping.

08:53.997 --> 08:57.413
I turn my head for one second,
next thing I know it's on the track s.

08:57.542 --> 09:01.872
With all due respect,
we've got the right of way out here.

09:02.005 --> 09:03.547
Thanks for your time.

09:07.302 --> 09:08.678
That's not yours, is it?

09:08.804 --> 09:10.428
I am collecting evidence.

09:10.555 --> 09:12.429
Do you have an address on the vic yet?

09:12.557 --> 09:14.100
855 Martingale.

09:15.602 --> 09:17.678
The vic had a passenger.

09:17.813 --> 09:19.521
Say hello to Maverick.

09:21.566 --> 09:23.643
Have you finished with our lady of the library?

09:23.777 --> 09:25.853
As finished as I'm going to be.

09:25.988 --> 09:28.526
You were right. Cyanosis.

09:28.657 --> 09:31.860
The blood was unable to oxygenate her tissue.

09:36.164 --> 09:39.533
Explains the blue face. Underlying cause?

09:39.668 --> 09:41.826
With blood in her lungs, asphyxiation's out.

09:41.962 --> 09:44.287
I found vomit in her throat bloody stool

09:44.423 --> 09:48.551
haemolysis and some irritation
of the mucous membrane on her tongue.

09:48.677 --> 09:53.588
I won't know more till I get the blood tests back.
Could be blood-borne disease.

09:53.724 --> 09:55.515
I'm thinking about homicide.

09:55.642 --> 09:57.599
Then you know more than I do.

10:05.027 --> 10:06.687
Excuse me sir

10:06.820 --> 10:08.978
- It's fine.
- Whoa, whoa.

10:09.114 --> 10:10.525
Sir, you can't come in here.

10:10.657 --> 10:12.982
I told the officer upstairs. I'm Stanley Hunter.

10:14.578 --> 10:18.243
The curator? Do you have any idea
of the damage you're causing?

10:18.373 --> 10:19.915
With your dust,

10:20.042 --> 10:22.165
flashbulbs.

10:22.294 --> 10:24.619
You see that? Right there behind you.

10:24.755 --> 10:28.622
That is a 17th-century text
by Johannes Vanden Avelen.

10:28.759 --> 10:31.214
It's one of two volumes in the world.

10:33.138 --> 10:37.966
Now, do you go to the Louvre and
put your hands all over the Raft Of The Medusa?

10:38.101 --> 10:41.684
Officer, Mr Hunter would like to give
his statement to Detective O'Riley.

10:41.813 --> 10:44.649
Statement? I just got here.
I don't even know what happened.

10:44.775 --> 10:49.022
But what I do know
is that these are masterpieces.

10:49.154 --> 10:50.613
One of a kind.

10:50.739 --> 10:54.784
They're evidence in an active criminal
investigation. Also one of a kind.

10:54.910 --> 10:56.452
Mr Hunter

10:56.578 --> 10:58.820
why don't we go upstairs and talk?

11:22.854 --> 11:25.725
The good news, Nick. We had a camera in here.

11:25.857 --> 11:28.064
But there's no surveillance system.

11:28.193 --> 11:30.649
Yeah, there is. Aaron Pratt.

11:30.779 --> 11:35.026
We just have to figure out
how to get the film out of his head.

12:01.852 --> 12:02.966
Filament.

12:03.103 --> 12:05.309
Train probably busted out her headlights.

12:05.439 --> 12:08.274
First thing on our list
when we get to the tow yard.

12:14.281 --> 12:15.360
Catherine?

12:15.490 --> 12:17.483
Check this out.

12:21.330 --> 12:23.322
Two sets of skid mark s.

12:25.417 --> 12:26.995
One set going forward...

12:30.380 --> 12:33.500
These skid marks
are about seven feet shy of the gate.

12:34.968 --> 12:37.293
The second set of skid marks are darker.

12:37.429 --> 12:39.967
More rubber residue

12:40.098 --> 12:42.091
Could be an overlay.

12:48.023 --> 12:50.431
Looks like the tyres were spinning in place.

12:50.567 --> 12:52.275
In reverse

12:53.445 --> 12:55.354
Burnin' rubber. Goin' nowhere.

12:57.240 --> 12:59.447
So...

12:59.576 --> 13:01.818
which set of skid marks are telling the story?

13:01.954 --> 13:03.946
Maybe they both are.

13:06.708 --> 13:09.199
So all of your chemicals in here are alkaline?

13:09.336 --> 13:12.456
No. We're not dealing with the far ends
of the pH range.

13:12.589 --> 13:15.259
See, old book pages are slightly acidic.

13:15.342 --> 13:19.174
The acid eats away the paper.
We neutralise them by a solution

13:19.304 --> 13:22.341
- that is slightly basic.
- To reach seven. Neutral pH.

13:22.474 --> 13:24.348
Exactly. Imidazole.

13:24.476 --> 13:26.552
15 per cent ammonia.

13:26.687 --> 13:29.260
That's the sort of thing we work with here.

13:29.398 --> 13:31.770
It's all about preserving the book s.

13:33.568 --> 13:36.854
You know,
not that you could even assign a value,

13:36.989 --> 13:39.859
but do you have any idea
how much each of these books is worth?

13:39.992 --> 13:42.031
No.

13:42.160 --> 13:45.660
The first printed book was the Gutenberg Bible.

13:45.789 --> 13:48.114
It sold at Christie's for $5.3 million.

13:48.250 --> 13:51.120
Lewis and Clark's Elkskin Journal

13:51.253 --> 13:53.922
sold for $500,000.

13:54.006 --> 13:59.795
We have an illustrated Audubon, The Birds Of
America, which is worth an estimated $300,000.

14:01.388 --> 14:04.555
All of that and you never thought
about beefing up your security?

14:04.683 --> 14:07.091
Special collections are kept in the vault.

14:07.227 --> 14:09.386
Any rare book removed from the vault

14:09.521 --> 14:11.015
gets scanned through a coder.

14:11.148 --> 14:12.523
If the book is to be read,

14:12.649 --> 14:15.140
it's delivered to a secure room upstairs,

14:15.277 --> 14:18.942
and if Veronica was going to work on it,
it stayed down here.

14:19.072 --> 14:21.824
Was this one of the books
that Veronica was restoring?

14:21.950 --> 14:23.859
Yes.

14:23.994 --> 14:25.737
It was published in 1 T9T.

14:25.871 --> 14:27.579
The author was a British botanist.

14:27.706 --> 14:31.039
It's worth an estimated $300,000.

14:33.378 --> 14:36.249
It's really not a dangerous profession.

14:42.554 --> 14:43.883
We got a situation.

14:44.014 --> 14:46.587
You know that weird guy?

14:46.725 --> 14:49.014
He's not weird, O'Riley, he's autistic.

14:49.144 --> 14:52.513
Whatever.
First on the scene and he's got sticky fingers.

14:56.443 --> 15:00.939
"But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve
for daws to peck at: I am not what I am."

15:01.073 --> 15:07.787
Othello, Act 1, Scene 1, lines 61 and 62.
Lago to Roderigo.

15:07.913 --> 15:11.863
Very good, Aaron. Now, you want to tell me
how Othello ended up in your briefcase?

15:14.711 --> 15:17.961
It's my favourite Shakespeare tragedy.

15:19.091 --> 15:21.795
I like Hamlet myself.
And I bet Mr Hunter is into King Lear.

15:21.927 --> 15:23.884
He's very concerned with property rights.

15:24.012 --> 15:28.591
He tells me the rare books are kept in the vault
and they're not allowed off site

15:28.725 --> 15:31.512
(Whispers) Well, Mr Hunter doesn't like me.

15:31.645 --> 15:34.183
I don't think the rule was made with you in mind.

15:34.314 --> 15:37.019
He breaks the rules all the time.

15:37.150 --> 15:39.060
He takes the books home?

15:39.194 --> 15:43.192
No, he... eats his lunch in his office.

15:43.323 --> 15:45.861
Carrots celery

15:45.993 --> 15:50.073
tuna on wholewheat...

15:50.205 --> 15:51.699
And Veronica.

15:53.792 --> 15:55.500
What do you mean "and Veronica"?

15:58.171 --> 16:03.296
She's eating, and he takes her sandwich...

16:04.928 --> 16:08.593
and he puts his hand on her breast

16:12.894 --> 16:16.595
- And then he puts his tongue
Aaron!

16:17.024 --> 16:18.352
I get it.

16:20.152 --> 16:21.776
Did they know you were watching?

16:36.835 --> 16:38.543
You know that filament you picked up?

16:38.670 --> 16:40.248
Yeah?

16:40.380 --> 16:42.871
The lamp cover's smashed
but the filament's intact.

16:43.008 --> 16:45.416
So the filament's from another car?

16:45.552 --> 16:47.924
Well... tail-lights have different filaments,

16:48.055 --> 16:50.213
so yean

16:52.059 --> 16:53.090
Paint transfer.

16:53.226 --> 16:55.552
- Recent?
- Hard to say

17:02.527 --> 17:05.196
This right rear tyre's lost a lot of rubber.

17:10.285 --> 17:11.566
I got a cellphone.

17:15.874 --> 17:17.867
Battery's dead.

17:19.544 --> 17:20.789
Hey, Catherine?

17:20.921 --> 17:22.913
Her emergency brake was on.

17:25.300 --> 17:26.675
Maybe her brakes failed.

17:28.303 --> 17:32.253
She had to engage it for some reason. I'm
thinking maybe another vehicle was involved.

17:32.391 --> 17:35.060
The engineer didn't mention
a second driver.

17:35.143 --> 17:37.350
Maybe he didn't see it.

17:39.147 --> 17:40.855
15 minutes before my next post.

17:40.983 --> 17:43.059
Bottled chemicals from the library?

17:44.820 --> 17:46.563
Great room.

17:47.739 --> 17:49.649
Great table.

17:49.783 --> 17:51.443
I could use this.

17:51.576 --> 17:53.035
Lay out all the body parts,

17:53.161 --> 17:55.154
get a real overview.

17:56.331 --> 17:58.739
Is that a light under there?

17:58.875 --> 18:01.082
- Do you have something for me?
- Oh, your vic?

18:01.211 --> 18:03.785
Poisoned. Substance as yet unidentified.

18:05.132 --> 18:10.209
There's no smoking gun in any of these bottles.
What's on the label is what's in the bottle.

18:10.345 --> 18:15.221
Isopropyl alcohol, 15 per cent ammonia solution,
imidazole, bleach.

18:15.350 --> 18:19.134
When you isolate the toxin,
you'll have a better idea where it came from.

18:19.271 --> 18:21.726
- Nick?
- Hm?

18:21.857 --> 18:23.684
I love this table.

18:25.444 --> 18:27.436
There's no glass on the filament.

18:29.323 --> 18:31.232
10:30 at night?

18:31.366 --> 18:34.984
Crim 101. If a guy's driving along at night
with his lights on,

18:35.120 --> 18:38.869
gets in a wreck glass breaks
fuses to the filament

18:38.999 --> 18:40.992
Instant evidence.

18:42.794 --> 18:45.831
But there's no glass on the filament.
His headlights weren't on.

18:58.226 --> 19:00.978
Black car, headlights off...

19:02.272 --> 19:04.229
Easy for an engineer to miss.

19:04.358 --> 19:05.733
So he hit her SUV.

19:07.069 --> 19:09.524
Accidental or intentional?

19:09.655 --> 19:11.398
Hard to tell.

19:11.531 --> 19:14.283
- Maybe not.
(Dials)

19:24.127 --> 19:27.247
- These books are from the Historical Society.
- That's my mail.

19:28.423 --> 19:30.380
Aaron, what about these book s?

19:30.509 --> 19:32.466
No, d-d-don't mix those up.

19:32.594 --> 19:38.348
I have two bills due tomorrow, gas and electric,
and I have to mail them on my way to work.

19:39.851 --> 19:42.010
Don't. You're messing everything up.

19:43.146 --> 19:45.435
Aaron, may I have a glass of water, please?

19:47.150 --> 19:49.309
- Of course you may.
- Thank you.

19:52.698 --> 19:54.737
Is this guy the real deal?

19:55.909 --> 19:57.902
I think he's incapable of deception, Nick.

19:58.036 --> 20:00.907
We were just witnessing displaced anxiety.

20:01.039 --> 20:02.533
I mean, look around.

20:02.666 --> 20:04.659
Everything's in precise order.

20:06.628 --> 20:07.909
Organised by size.

20:08.046 --> 20:12.507
Order provides comfort. His whole life is based
on routine. Without it, he can't function.

20:14.886 --> 20:16.879
I'll check out the bedroom.

20:18.056 --> 20:21.425
Mountain Spring Water, Calistoga, California.
Bottled at the source.

20:21.560 --> 20:22.935
Thank you.

20:23.061 --> 20:24.603
You're welcome.

20:24.730 --> 20:26.354
Now, how did these books get here?

20:27.983 --> 20:30.937
- Veronica brought them.
- She was here?

20:31.069 --> 20:34.023
Yes, she was here.

20:34.156 --> 20:35.436
We date.

20:36.950 --> 20:38.492
What do you mean you date?

20:38.619 --> 20:41.074
We have dinner.

20:41.204 --> 20:44.040
Roast beef, baked potato,

20:44.166 --> 20:47.036
organic broccoli

20:47.169 --> 20:49.541
Acacia Pinot Noir.

20:49.671 --> 20:51.082
Shakespeare In Love.

20:51.214 --> 20:52.839
DVD, Miramax.

20:52.966 --> 20:56.382
MCMX CVIII.

20:59.514 --> 21:02.052
You two were involved with each other?

21:02.184 --> 21:06.228
Why, don't you think
she would date someone like me?

21:06.355 --> 21:10.399
No. You told me
Veronica was involved with Mr Hunter.

21:10.525 --> 21:14.108
I have a Masters in Library Science

21:14.237 --> 21:17.155
and an English degree from UNLV.

21:17.282 --> 21:22.787
And some people, like Mr Hunter,
treat me like a freak.

21:23.914 --> 21:26.239
But Veronica didn't.

21:27.501 --> 21:29.374
She...loved me.

21:30.587 --> 21:31.832
Not him.

21:31.964 --> 21:33.078
Grissom?

21:34.299 --> 21:36.043
You might want to come back here a sec.

21:37.970 --> 21:39.049
Thank you.

21:48.021 --> 21:50.014
Personal effects.

21:51.358 --> 21:53.647
Like some... creepy little shrine.

21:55.487 --> 21:57.230
Vic's hair. She was seeing Hunter.

21:57.364 --> 21:59.357
Aaron got jealous.

22:03.453 --> 22:06.027
Incapable of deception, huh?

22:06.164 --> 22:07.789
How do you feel about murder?

22:12.087 --> 22:14.376
"Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men.

22:15.882 --> 22:19.382
Put out the light, and then put out the light."

22:25.601 --> 22:31.187
Last call on her cellphone was to 911. Reel
to reel's already interfaced on my computer.

22:32.399 --> 22:34.059
911 What's your emergency?

22:34.192 --> 22:36.150
On my God you've got to help me!

22:36.278 --> 22:40.739
- Try to calm down Where are you?
- There's this maniac he's following me

22:40.866 --> 22:42.111
(Train horn)

22:42.242 --> 22:44.614
- Help me please!
- What's your location?

22:44.745 --> 22:46.951
(Dog whimpers)

22:47.080 --> 22:49.785
- Can you isolate the individual track s?
- Yes, ma'am.

22:49.916 --> 22:52.752
- Good. Lose the dog.
- Train too, please.

22:54.087 --> 22:58.085
- Ma'am what's your location?
- Help me please!

22:58.216 --> 23:01.632
- On God no!
(Small creak)

23:01.762 --> 23:04.597
- Please stop! Help!
(Engine revs)

23:04.723 --> 23:05.968
No!

23:06.099 --> 23:07.475
She was flooring it.

23:07.601 --> 23:10.306
With the emergency brake on.
It doesn't make any sense.

23:10.437 --> 23:13.473
OK. Lose the victim's voice
and let's just hear the car.

23:16.276 --> 23:18.150
(Revving)

23:19.905 --> 23:21.648
Two engines.

23:21.782 --> 23:23.774
- Separate them out.
- Yeah.

23:25.369 --> 23:26.614
(Revving)

23:26.745 --> 23:28.987
SUV

23:29.122 --> 23:31.411
Sounds like any regular four-cylinder.

23:32.918 --> 23:34.412
(Revving)

23:36.046 --> 23:38.751
- Sounds like the same thing.
- No, no. Hang on.

23:41.927 --> 23:43.338
(High-pitched revving)

23:44.930 --> 23:47.255
You hear that? Turbo.

23:47.391 --> 23:48.801
Probably diesel.

23:53.105 --> 23:55.097
She definitely likes you.

23:57.818 --> 24:00.523
Did you ever see
Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes?

24:00.821 --> 24:05.032
Cos there's something in your victim's blood
that looks like one of those Heirlooms.

24:06.326 --> 24:08.996
No, it's not pulling a spectra, it's not a chemical.

24:09.079 --> 24:11.652
No, it's a large, ugly, globular mass.

24:11.790 --> 24:15.704
You know, it's probably a protein.
That's the largest mass of anything in the body.

24:15.836 --> 24:17.793
Except organs, of course.

24:17.921 --> 24:20.246
But it's foreign. How did it get in there?

24:20.382 --> 24:21.924
Cart before the horse, Nick.

24:22.050 --> 24:25.585
First you identify it,
then you figure out where it came from.

24:28.015 --> 24:31.466
- I always thought you kept your porn in there.
- Uh, move it around.

24:33.270 --> 24:37.517
OK, this is a 66-kilodalton globular protein.

24:37.649 --> 24:42.027
Composed of two disulphide linked sub-units,
A and B.

24:42.154 --> 24:43.696
Very impressive.

24:43.822 --> 24:45.862
I know what you all think of me.

24:45.991 --> 24:48.743
That I'm just another pretty face

24:48.869 --> 24:52.035
that got to where I am
by sleeping with Catherine.

24:54.541 --> 24:55.739
But seriously,

24:55.876 --> 24:58.545
Phi Beta Kappa, Stanford.

24:58.629 --> 25:00.705
Can I help it if I'm hip?

25:00.839 --> 25:03.330
Yeah, yeah.
Which one of your relatives got you in?

25:03.467 --> 25:04.747
Full ride.

25:04.885 --> 25:07.257
Hey, eyes forward.

25:07.387 --> 25:11.337
Now, A and B chains link together to form

25:11.475 --> 25:15.935
a large three-dimensional structure
of these beta sheets and helices.

25:16.063 --> 25:17.521
- Translation?
- Wait.

25:17.648 --> 25:22.393
You just drew the molecular structure
of a foreign protein. Plant?

25:22.527 --> 25:25.861
Correct. But more specifically, lectin.

25:27.866 --> 25:30.784
(Gasps) This is nastier than I thought.

25:30.911 --> 25:33.402
It's ricin. A biotoxin.

25:33.538 --> 25:35.246
- Biotoxin?
- Yeah.

25:35.374 --> 25:37.200
"A B chain binds to glycoside residues

25:37.334 --> 25:42.079
which trigger endocytotic uptake of the protein,
which internalises the toxin and begins..."

25:42.214 --> 25:44.705
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop now. Biotoxin

25:44.841 --> 25:47.842
as in... anthrax, smallpox?

25:47.970 --> 25:50.377
I was at that crime scene for eight hours, man.

25:50.514 --> 25:54.761
Relax, man. It takes, like,
two hours for ricin symptoms to show

25:54.893 --> 25:58.428
- and, like, 48 more to kill you.
- What kind of symptoms are we talking about?

25:58.563 --> 26:00.603
Um...

26:00.732 --> 26:02.772
Sweats?

26:02.901 --> 26:05.143
- Cramps?
- No.

26:05.279 --> 26:07.105
- Convulsions?
- Uh-uh.

26:07.239 --> 26:08.567
Then you're fine.

26:08.699 --> 26:10.822
Now, where did you say this woman worked?

26:10.951 --> 26:13.620
Western States Historical Society.

26:13.704 --> 26:15.281
Hey.

26:16.415 --> 26:18.953
I just got the word on our library victim.

26:19.084 --> 26:21.041
How does ricin grab you?

26:21.169 --> 26:23.660
Wow. Ricin. I never would have gone there.

26:23.797 --> 26:27.248
But it explains the irritation
of the mucous membrane on her tongue.

26:28.885 --> 26:31.127
So you think she ate the poison?

26:31.263 --> 26:32.674
I don't know about ate,

26:32.806 --> 26:35.214
but the ricin made contact with her tongue,

26:35.350 --> 26:38.268
which means
you're probably looking for a powder.

27:43.210 --> 27:45.119
A day in the life.

27:45.253 --> 27:46.534
Megan Treadwell

27:46.672 --> 27:50.254
Wakes up at home on Martingale Street
puts the dog in the car

27:50.384 --> 27:53.301
heads to work, at her desk by 9am.

27:53.428 --> 27:54.377
And we know this how?

27:54.513 --> 27:56.968
Brass. Talked to her boss.

27:57.099 --> 27:59.424
- Why the dog?
- Dog went with her every day.

28:00.769 --> 28:04.387
- So she works till six?
- Eight, actually. Hard worker.

28:05.899 --> 28:08.224
She packs up and leaves the office.

28:08.360 --> 28:11.231
Except she doesn't go home.
She runs an errand.

28:11.363 --> 28:14.198
I found these in the front seat of her SUV.

28:14.324 --> 28:16.898
There's only one store in Las Vegas
that makes them.

28:17.035 --> 28:19.526
Yeah, but it happens all the time.

28:19.663 --> 28:22.154
The parking spaces are too narrow.

28:22.291 --> 28:25.208
And at a premium
now that the restaurant moved in.

28:25.335 --> 28:27.244
This guy was out of line.

28:27.379 --> 28:29.372
Almost... psycho.

28:29.506 --> 28:31.463
Because of this woman?

28:31.592 --> 28:33.917
Yeah. Maverick's owner.

28:34.052 --> 28:35.381
I think her name was

28:35.512 --> 28:37.754
um... something with an M.

28:37.889 --> 28:39.265
- Megan.
- Yeah.

28:39.391 --> 28:42.725
And this guy yelled so loud.
I came out here just to check it out.

28:42.853 --> 28:45.937
- He said something like...
- "You could nave killed me bitch!"

28:46.064 --> 28:47.974
I heard it too.

28:48.108 --> 28:49.650
- Did you see it?
- Kind of

28:49.776 --> 28:52.611
I mean, I didn't hear a crash or anything,
just brakes.

28:52.738 --> 28:54.979
It seemed like she backed out didn't see him

28:55.115 --> 28:56.775
Happened right over there.

29:00.287 --> 29:01.995
Oh. Oh. Hey! Hey!

29:02.122 --> 29:04.079
And that set him off?

29:04.207 --> 29:06.283
The last thing this guy needed was coffee.

29:06.418 --> 29:09.454
Hey! Pull your head out of your ass
and use your mirror!

29:09.588 --> 29:11.627
Was he a regular?

29:11.757 --> 29:16.584
Double latte, tall. Monday through Friday
between 8:30 and 9:00.

29:16.720 --> 29:19.258
Does Mr Double Latte have a name?

29:20.766 --> 29:22.639
I think it's Croft.

29:22.768 --> 29:24.476
Works right down the street CPA

29:24.603 --> 29:27.141
He's always telling us
how to streamline our business.

29:27.272 --> 29:29.312
How did Megan react to Mr Croft?

29:29.441 --> 29:30.852
She told him to go to hell.

29:31.193 --> 29:33.185
- Go to hell!
- No you go to hell!

29:34.154 --> 29:36.479
You're an ass!

29:36.782 --> 29:38.490
And then just drove off.

29:38.617 --> 29:40.942
And what about Mr Croft?

29:41.078 --> 29:45.027
Everyone was just staring at him,
and then he got in his car and peeled out.

29:55.259 --> 29:56.634
Ricinus communis.

29:56.760 --> 29:59.216
Un castor beans Like in castor oil

29:59.346 --> 30:01.671
Botanically speaking, it's a spurge, not a bean.

30:01.807 --> 30:03.680
Ricin is made from the husk

30:03.809 --> 30:05.517
Castor oil is made from what's inside.

30:05.644 --> 30:08.135
Hm. Which makes two people who know that.

30:08.272 --> 30:10.348
- You and the guy who wrote the book.
- Three

30:10.482 --> 30:13.436
Someone knew
how to turn this spurge into a poison.

30:13.568 --> 30:16.238
Hey, guys. That's Aaron's book, right?

30:16.321 --> 30:17.270
Mm-hm.

30:17.406 --> 30:19.813
Shouldn't you be looking at that
under a fume hood?

30:19.950 --> 30:22.357
We brought this from his apartment,
not his office.

30:22.494 --> 30:26.741
What makes you think there's a difference?
He probably cooked up that ricin in his kitchen.

30:26.873 --> 30:29.032
Our guys didn't find anything there.

30:29.167 --> 30:31.374
So he cleans up well.

30:31.503 --> 30:34.172
What, you're not feeling sorry
for this guy now, are you?

30:34.298 --> 30:37.252
- Hey, man, he is autistic.
- Anybody else would be in a cell.

30:44.516 --> 30:47.932
Yes, I've heard of ricin.

30:48.061 --> 30:51.561
Georgi Markov, 19T8.

30:51.690 --> 30:55.557
Bulgarian political refugee in London

30:55.694 --> 30:57.069
Assassinated

30:57.195 --> 31:02.438
by injection with a ricin pellet
shot out of a black umbrella.

31:02.576 --> 31:04.118
Died two days later.

31:04.244 --> 31:07.198
Not that different
from the way Veronica died, is it?

31:11.627 --> 31:13.619
I found this book in your apartment.

31:15.005 --> 31:18.623
What if I also told you
that I found your fingerprint on this page?

31:20.385 --> 31:21.761
Page 153.

31:21.887 --> 31:24.425
I... don't touch that book any more.

31:24.556 --> 31:26.383
But you did touch it.

31:26.516 --> 31:28.972
Why are you mad at me?

31:29.102 --> 31:30.265
Answer the question.

31:30.395 --> 31:33.396
I don't touch this book any more!
It... doesn't feel right.

31:33.523 --> 31:35.646
Ever since you killed Veronica?

31:35.776 --> 31:38.064
I loved Veronica.

31:38.195 --> 31:40.271
What do you mean it doesn't feel right?

31:40.405 --> 31:41.781
Like

31:41.907 --> 31:44.279
a new bus pass.

31:44.409 --> 31:46.069
Smooth. Feel the page.

31:46.203 --> 31:51.624
It used to feel like my bus pass after a month.

31:51.750 --> 31:53.624
Now...

31:53.752 --> 31:55.745
rough.

31:58.548 --> 32:01.752
Did you tell anyone
that the illustrations felt different?

32:01.885 --> 32:03.427
Yes.

32:03.553 --> 32:07.800
I told Veronica and I told Mr Hunter.

32:07.933 --> 32:09.427
She said that sometimes

32:09.559 --> 32:12.229
the books feel that way
after they've been restored.

32:12.312 --> 32:13.854
What did Mr Hunter say?

32:13.981 --> 32:18.643
He said, "Get out of my office, Aaron.
I'm having my lunch!"

32:19.945 --> 32:24.523
Was Mr Hunter having lunch
with Veronica again?

32:24.658 --> 32:29.154
Hard-boiled egg, celery, fruit salad,

32:29.288 --> 32:30.236
iced tea

32:30.372 --> 32:31.950
Veronica was on a diet

32:32.082 --> 32:34.454
She had to lose three pounds.

32:34.584 --> 32:37.621
Was this lunch different from the other lunches
you told me about?

32:39.965 --> 32:41.792
Yes.

32:41.925 --> 32:43.004
How?

32:43.135 --> 32:45.886
They fought.

32:47.431 --> 32:49.174
Aaron,

32:49.308 --> 32:52.842
I want you to be very specific.
Tell me what you saw.

32:55.814 --> 32:57.095
You did what?

32:58.650 --> 33:01.604
All I have is my reputation
and I am not gonna let you ruin it!

33:02.738 --> 33:04.730
Veronica started crying.

33:07.075 --> 33:09.401
Mr Hunter stopped yelling.

33:09.536 --> 33:11.529
He sat down

33:13.081 --> 33:14.706
He started eating

33:15.834 --> 33:18.669
He cut the hard-boiled egg in half.

33:23.467 --> 33:25.673
He reached in the drawer

33:25.802 --> 33:29.088
and pulled out the salt shaker

33:29.222 --> 33:32.508
No sex, no food, no salt.

34:04.841 --> 34:08.886
- Poison? What are you talking about?
- We're talking about ricin

34:09.012 --> 34:12.844
The toxin that killed Veronica Bradley.
You were dating her.

34:12.975 --> 34:16.639
- You ate lunch together.
- Opportunity. You mix up a batch of ricin,

34:16.770 --> 34:20.103
put it in the shaker. Next time
you break bread, she asks for the salt...

34:20.232 --> 34:21.393
Never happened.

34:21.525 --> 34:24.063
We have a witness who says
he saw you try to kill her.

34:24.194 --> 34:25.735
What? Aaron?

34:26.862 --> 34:28.239
Are you sure you trust him?

34:28.364 --> 34:32.826
Normally an eyewitness is the least reliable
evidence, but here, it's the most reliable.

34:32.953 --> 34:34.780
Veronica knew about the forgeries

34:36.540 --> 34:39.078
A career-ender, huh, Stanley?

34:39.208 --> 34:42.543
For her, not for me. She's the forger.

34:44.214 --> 34:46.088
Oh, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron.

34:46.216 --> 34:47.246
(Tuts)

34:47.384 --> 34:50.219
I suppose he indicted me for that, too?

34:50.344 --> 34:53.346
He's the one who came to me.
Told me about the illustrations.

34:53.473 --> 34:57.056
Said they felt like his bus pass,
whatever that means.

34:58.186 --> 34:59.301
Go on.

34:59.438 --> 35:04.064
He even knew the page numbers.
So I checked it out and he was right.

35:04.192 --> 35:06.518
Veronica was using me.

35:06.653 --> 35:08.064
Mea culpa.

35:08.196 --> 35:11.482
Why didn't you tell us
about the forgeries earlier?

35:11.617 --> 35:14.286
When she died
I thought the problem was solved.

35:14.411 --> 35:17.080
In this business, all you have is your reputation.

35:17.205 --> 35:20.491
It was a dozen books
I was going to remove them from the collection

35:20.626 --> 35:23.959
inform the board,
collect the insurance and cut my losses.

35:26.048 --> 35:30.045
If you don't believe me,
go ask your very reliable witness.

35:32.429 --> 35:34.635
Tell me again. What did you see?

35:34.765 --> 35:38.762
Uniball pen rolls across the desk,

35:38.894 --> 35:42.512
falls on the chair, hits the floor,

35:42.648 --> 35:44.724
and stops rolling at the wastebasket.

35:46.151 --> 35:50.445
Then water falls into Veronica's eyes.

35:50.572 --> 35:51.687
Aaron,

35:51.823 --> 35:54.611
when you look at things,
you see pictures in your mind.

35:54.743 --> 35:56.368
Tell me the first picture you see

35:56.495 --> 35:59.780
- of Veronica in this cage.
- I already told you.

35:59.915 --> 36:02.322
Tell me something you haven't told me.

36:02.459 --> 36:05.377
Tell me what Veronica was doing
before you said good night.

36:06.546 --> 36:09.037
She pulled out a canvas bag.

36:10.467 --> 36:13.421
Then she looked around.

36:13.553 --> 36:16.009
Why was she looking around?

36:16.139 --> 36:18.844
She was deciding something.

36:20.185 --> 36:25.227
Tell me what Veronica deciding something
looks like.

36:47.713 --> 36:49.586
Thank you, Aaron.

36:51.675 --> 36:55.922
Veronica Bradley must have loved Uniballs.
She had about a dozen at her house.

36:56.054 --> 36:58.759
Plus every known piece of forgery equipment.

36:58.890 --> 37:01.560
Some people bite their nails, she bit her pens.

37:03.437 --> 37:04.812
Bad habit.

37:06.023 --> 37:07.683
I also found this

37:07.816 --> 37:11.565
Under her refrigerator.
Funny how people don't think to clean there.

37:14.406 --> 37:15.604
Castor bean

37:15.741 --> 37:17.199
Ricinus communis.

37:24.750 --> 37:27.537
If we find ricin on any of the pens
from her house,

37:27.669 --> 37:29.958
we'll know where she cooked up
the castor beans.

37:30.088 --> 37:32.081
And maybe how she died.

37:33.216 --> 37:37.380
Get these to Greg right away.
We need the results of the ricin ELISA test.

37:39.348 --> 37:42.681
I came home straight from work.
I don't know what you're talking about.

37:42.809 --> 37:44.304
You want to submit to a line-up?

37:44.436 --> 37:46.144
A line-up?

37:46.271 --> 37:47.931
What for?

37:53.403 --> 37:56.190
His car, out in the parking lot, it's a rental.

37:56.323 --> 37:58.362
Rented this morning

37:58.492 --> 38:01.161
- Let's just cut the BS. Where's your car?
- I sold it.

38:01.286 --> 38:02.531
You got proof of sale?

38:04.498 --> 38:08.626
- An accountant who doesn't keep receipts.
- Hey, you don't know anything about me.

38:08.752 --> 38:10.330
I know you've got a temper.

38:14.800 --> 38:18.632
Hey. Brass did the legwork
and rushed the warrant.

38:18.762 --> 38:21.134
Found it in a body shop a mile from his house.

38:21.265 --> 38:23.969
Black Excursion. Turbo diesel.

38:28.605 --> 38:30.812
- Gutted.
- Gets better

38:32.192 --> 38:35.027
The vic's SUV was silver.

38:35.153 --> 38:36.612
What do you think?

38:36.738 --> 38:40.606
- Well this is a lot more than a fender bender
- Sustained contact

38:40.742 --> 38:42.450
Get some scrapings.

38:42.577 --> 38:44.404
Yeah.

39:09.271 --> 39:12.188
I think I may know what set this guy off.

39:13.984 --> 39:15.526
He spilled his coffee.

39:31.835 --> 39:33.413
Not a good colour for Croft.

39:49.311 --> 39:52.596
Coffee on the outside, coffee on the inside.

39:53.774 --> 39:55.351
Lipstick on the lid.

39:55.484 --> 39:57.026
She threw her coffee at him.

39:58.779 --> 40:02.990
Croft chases her from the parking lot
caught up to her at the light

40:03.116 --> 40:05.405
they said their screw you, screw yous.

40:05.535 --> 40:08.702
I think I know the word
that made her throw the coffee.

40:08.830 --> 40:10.111
I hate that word.

40:12.876 --> 40:15.284
Does this ever fit? She nailed him

40:15.420 --> 40:17.662
The light turns green and the chase is on.

40:17.798 --> 40:19.541
Now she's got a problem

40:27.307 --> 40:28.849
She's got a pursuit on her hands.

40:28.976 --> 40:31.893
- And she's the pursued.
- So she dials 911

40:32.020 --> 40:36.599
- 911 What's your emergency?
- Oh, my God! You've got to help me.

40:36.733 --> 40:39.059
But somehow she loses him.

40:39.194 --> 40:41.353
And she's still spooked.

40:41.488 --> 40:44.026
All she wants now is to get home.

40:47.077 --> 40:49.402
Please... Please!

40:53.917 --> 40:55.910
(Crossing bell rings)

41:00.924 --> 41:02.335
Hey, sweetie.

41:09.474 --> 41:11.099
Help! No!

41:12.352 --> 41:13.134
Stop!

41:13.270 --> 41:15.725
That's why she had the emergency brake on.

41:27.909 --> 41:29.902
She could have jumped out.

41:30.037 --> 41:31.946
Not without her dog.

41:32.080 --> 41:32.994
Help!

41:36.710 --> 41:38.619
(Engine fails to start)

41:40.130 --> 41:41.838
No!

41:51.475 --> 41:54.974
And that's why
you always cut the other driver some slack.

41:55.103 --> 41:58.887
I'll call Brass. Tell him to make the arrest.

42:01.318 --> 42:05.731
Veronica removed the original illustrations from
the books and replaced them with forgeries,

42:05.864 --> 42:07.572
which she then left at your house,

42:07.699 --> 42:10.819
so that she could point the finger at you
if it ever came to that.

42:10.953 --> 42:13.241
She never thought you'd find out, but you did.

42:13.372 --> 42:15.779
And you told Mr Hunter.

42:15.916 --> 42:18.786
All you have in this business is your reputation.

42:20.504 --> 42:24.204
So Veronica tried to save hers,
but instead of killing Mr Hunter,

42:24.341 --> 42:26.215
she ended up killing herself.

42:29.429 --> 42:31.422
- Sorry.
- That's OK.

42:39.856 --> 42:41.766
I like order.

42:41.900 --> 42:44.356
Me too.

42:45.862 --> 42:47.570
That's why I was scared.

42:48.740 --> 42:51.112
Scared?

42:51.243 --> 42:53.117
Of Veronica.

42:54.329 --> 42:55.871
Being in love.

42:57.791 --> 42:59.997
I was stupid.

43:00.127 --> 43:02.665
I thought she loved me.

43:11.680 --> 43:16.556
"Then must you speak of one
that loved not wisely..."

43:16.685 --> 43:18.263
"...but too well."

43:19.396 --> 43:25.399
Othello, Act 5, Scene 2, lines 343 and 344.

43:27.112 --> 43:29.318
But Othello killed Desdemona.

43:29.448 --> 43:31.440
I didn't kill Veronica.

43:32.701 --> 43:35.274
No. You didn't.
