WEBVTT

00:02.173 --> 00:04.925
I got a year to live, Sam.
I'd like to make the most of this.

00:05.093 --> 00:08.544
What do you say we kill evil
sons of bitches and we raise a little hell?

00:11.182 --> 00:12.594
You didn't tell Dean?
- What?

00:12.768 --> 00:14.559
There's a new up-and-comer: Lilith.

00:14.728 --> 00:18.062
She really, really wants
Sam's intestines on a stick.

00:18.232 --> 00:19.892
Let Dean out of his deal right now.

00:20.067 --> 00:22.439
I'm just a saleswoman.
I got a boss like everybody.

00:22.611 --> 00:24.936
- Who holds the contract?
- I can't tell you.

00:26.824 --> 00:29.741
Bela Talbot's her real name.
The Colt.

00:29.910 --> 00:32.118
- Bela stole the Colt.
- I want it back, Bela.

00:32.289 --> 00:34.281
Your little pistol, you mean? Sorry.

00:34.457 --> 00:36.616
You understand
how many people are gonna die?

00:36.793 --> 00:39.082
What exactly is it
that you think I plan to do?

00:39.254 --> 00:42.623
Take the only weapon we have
and sell it to the highest bidder.

00:42.799 --> 00:45.290
- You know nothing about me.
Pack your crap.

00:45.468 --> 00:48.042
- Why? Where we going?
- We go hunt the bitch down.

00:48.221 --> 00:50.262
- I don't wanna go to hell.
- We'll save you.

00:50.433 --> 00:52.639
I'm scared, Sam. I'm really scared.

00:52.810 --> 00:55.597
And the only person that can
get me out of this thing is me.

00:55.771 --> 00:57.396
And me.

01:05.948 --> 01:07.692
Up for a drink?
No, I can't.

01:07.867 --> 01:11.071
I gotta be up at the crack of dawn.
Duty calls.

01:11.246 --> 01:13.155
A boob job?
I wish.

01:13.332 --> 01:15.490
No, some crabby old broad
wants the works.

01:15.667 --> 01:17.494
I need a forklift to get it all back up.

01:17.669 --> 01:20.291
All that work to hack,
what, 15 minutes off their faces?

01:20.464 --> 01:23.169
Staying young is a brutal business.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.074

01:59.755 --> 02:00.786
Hey, hey.

02:01.882 --> 02:04.373
Help! Help!

02:04.885 --> 02:09.465
Help! Help! Let me out of here.

02:09.640 --> 02:11.219
Help!

02:22.904 --> 02:24.019
Sir?

02:24.197 --> 02:25.361
Please.

02:25.908 --> 02:28.993
It's okay, sir.
Let me see what happened.

02:30.037 --> 02:32.244
Don't you worry.
There's nothing I haven't seen.

02:33.249 --> 02:35.740
- No, no, no.
- Let me see.

02:52.519 --> 02:53.978
Stop.

02:54.146 --> 02:56.020
You ready to talk?

02:57.816 --> 03:00.438
I don't know. I don't know anything.

03:01.028 --> 03:03.021
Oh, you hear that, Sam?
He doesn't know anything.

03:03.198 --> 03:04.277
Yeah, I heard.

03:04.449 --> 03:06.406
- I'm telling you the truth.
Oh, you are?

03:06.785 --> 03:09.073
My God, then I owe you an apology.

03:09.245 --> 03:10.574
Allow me to make it up to you.

03:18.922 --> 03:23.419
I'm gonna ask you one last time.
Who holds my contract?

03:35.398 --> 03:36.726
Your mother.

03:38.609 --> 03:41.315
Yeah, she, uh, showed it to me
right before I bent her over.

03:46.284 --> 03:48.407
I want a name.

03:48.578 --> 03:49.907
- Or else...
- Or what?

03:50.288 --> 03:51.320
Hmm?

03:51.498 --> 03:54.499
You gonna squirt your holy water
in both ends?

03:54.668 --> 03:57.752
Please. Brother, that's like a flea bite...

03:57.921 --> 04:00.674
...compared to what's coming to me
if I tell you jack.

04:03.469 --> 04:04.798
Do what you want.

04:04.971 --> 04:08.838
The only thing I'm scared of
is the demon holding your ticket.

04:23.365 --> 04:24.859
How's that feel? Does that feel good?

04:27.494 --> 04:29.202
Go ahead.

04:29.997 --> 04:31.491
Send me back to hell.

04:32.875 --> 04:35.792
Because when you get there,
I'll be waiting for you.

04:35.961 --> 04:37.420
With a few pals who are dying...

04:37.588 --> 04:40.839
...for a nice little meet and greet
with Dean Winchester.

04:42.886 --> 04:44.546
Should I?

04:44.721 --> 04:46.760
Send him someplace
he can't hurt anyone else.

05:00.738 --> 05:04.072
You ran the prints twice? You're sure?

05:05.743 --> 05:09.326
Okay. Yeah, just chalk it up to lab error.

05:09.497 --> 05:13.957
Ha, ha, don't I know it. Okay, thanks.
Yeah, I'll tell the lieutenant.

05:14.126 --> 05:15.585
Bury the body?

05:15.753 --> 05:17.379
Yeah. Poor schmuck.

05:17.547 --> 05:20.751
It's like these demons ride him hard
just for kicks.

05:23.178 --> 05:25.052
Uh. What's the phone call about?

05:25.430 --> 05:27.637
Remember that thing
in the paper yesterday?

05:27.808 --> 05:30.429
- Stripper suffocates dude with thighs?
- The other thing.

05:30.602 --> 05:34.682
Right, the guy that walks into the ER and
kneels over dead, his stomach ripped out?

05:34.857 --> 05:37.693
His liver, actually.
Anyways, I found something interesting.

05:37.860 --> 05:39.403
- What?
- The dead body?

05:39.571 --> 05:42.774
Covered in bloody fingerprints.
Not the victim's.

05:43.241 --> 05:45.613
Great, my man Dave Caruso'll
be stoked to hear it.

05:45.785 --> 05:50.412
Those fingerprints match
a guy who died in 1981.

05:50.582 --> 05:52.455
Really?

05:52.625 --> 05:54.915
So, what are we talking?
Uh, walking dead?

05:55.087 --> 05:57.329
- Walking, killing dead?
- Maybe.

05:57.923 --> 06:01.090
Zombies do like
the other "other white meat. "

06:01.302 --> 06:03.709
Huh. Mm.

06:03.888 --> 06:06.509
- What do you care about zombies?
- What do you mean?

06:06.682 --> 06:09.007
You've been on soul-saving detail
for months...

06:09.184 --> 06:12.138
...now three weeks out and
you're interested in some zombie action?

06:12.313 --> 06:14.187
You're the one
who's been gung ho to hunt.

06:14.357 --> 06:16.813
- I just thought I'd be doing you a favor.
- No, no, no.

06:16.985 --> 06:21.314
I didn't say I didn't wanna do it, okay?
Obviously, I wanna hunt some zombies.

06:21.489 --> 06:22.770
Okay, fine. Whatever.

06:29.372 --> 06:34.498
Yup, the rest of the body was intact.
The liver was the only organ missing.

06:34.670 --> 06:39.546
Where the liver was ripped out, did you
happen to notice any teeth marks?

06:39.717 --> 06:41.295
Can I see your badges?

06:41.469 --> 06:42.500
Of course, sure.

06:46.432 --> 06:49.184
Fine, so you're cops and morons.

06:49.352 --> 06:54.180
- Excuse me? No, no, we're very smart.
The liver was not ripped out.

07:00.197 --> 07:03.862
It was removed. Surgically.

07:04.034 --> 07:07.485
By someone who knew their way
around a scalpel.

07:08.956 --> 07:10.202
Didn't you read my report?

07:11.042 --> 07:15.704
Of course we did. It was, uh, riveting.
It's a real page-turner. Just delightful.

07:17.048 --> 07:18.626
- You done?
- I think so.

07:18.800 --> 07:20.377
- Please, go away.
- Okay.

07:20.552 --> 07:22.094
Sure.

07:27.308 --> 07:29.635
- What?
- Nothing.

07:29.812 --> 07:33.062
So that punches a hole in our
zombie theory, huh, that scalpel thing?

07:33.232 --> 07:35.723
Zombie with skills?
Dr. Quinn, medicine zombie.

07:37.111 --> 07:40.065
Maybe we're on the wrong track, Dean,
looking for hacked-up corpses.

07:40.239 --> 07:42.695
- What should we be looking for?
- Survivors.

07:42.867 --> 07:45.239
This isn't zombie lunch.
This is organ theft.

07:46.495 --> 07:50.576
I told the cops all of this yesterday.
I don't wanna talk about it anymore.

07:50.751 --> 07:52.209
Just a couple questions, sir.

07:52.377 --> 07:58.083
Hey, man, I just got my kidney stolen.
I'm tired.

07:58.467 --> 08:01.171
We'll be out of here quick.
Don't you wanna get the guy?

08:01.344 --> 08:02.922
Will it get me back my kidney?

08:04.556 --> 08:07.843
- Sir, what's the last thing you remember?
- Feeding my meter.

08:09.562 --> 08:14.983
I'm jumped from behind
and then I wake up strapped to a table.

08:15.151 --> 08:19.612
And then the worst pain
you could possibly imagine, only worse.

08:20.740 --> 08:23.278
And then I black out again, thank God.

08:23.451 --> 08:27.913
And then I wake up screaming
in some no-tell motel...

08:28.082 --> 08:30.786
...in a bathtub full of ice.

08:30.959 --> 08:32.917
Do you remember anything
about the surgery?

08:33.087 --> 08:36.171
What the guy looked like,
any details about the room?

08:36.340 --> 08:37.964
Now, let me think about that.

08:38.133 --> 08:39.960
Yeah.

08:40.135 --> 08:43.337
One thing is coming back to me.
You know what I remember?

08:43.514 --> 08:45.757
Getting my kidney cut out of my body.

08:52.899 --> 08:54.642
So I got a theory.
- Yeah?

08:54.818 --> 08:56.312
I talked to Mr. Giggles' doctor.

08:56.486 --> 08:59.155
Turns out,
his incisions were sewn up with silk.

08:59.322 --> 09:01.445
- That's weird.
- Yeah, nowadays it is.

09:01.616 --> 09:05.069
But silk used to be the suture of choice
back in early 19th century.

09:05.246 --> 09:07.915
It was problematic.
Patients would get massive infections.

09:08.082 --> 09:09.624
The death rate was insane.

09:10.251 --> 09:11.282
- Good times.
- Right.

09:11.460 --> 09:14.580
So doctors had to do whatever they could
to keep infections from spreading.

09:14.755 --> 09:16.831
- One way was maggots.
- Dude, I'm eating.

09:17.008 --> 09:20.341
It actually worked because maggots
eat bad tissue and leave good tissue.

09:20.511 --> 09:24.177
Get this, when they found our guy, his
body cavity was stuffed full of maggots.

09:24.349 --> 09:28.133
Dude, I'm eating.
All right, let me get this straight.

09:28.729 --> 09:30.223
- So people are getting ganked.
- Yeah.

09:30.397 --> 09:32.853
<i>A little Antiques Roadshow surgery,
some, uh, organ theft.</i>

09:33.025 --> 09:35.480
- Why is this all sounding familiar?
- You heard it before.

09:35.652 --> 09:36.850
When you were a kid.

09:37.029 --> 09:38.191
From Dad.

09:40.991 --> 09:42.023
Doc Benton.

09:42.201 --> 09:44.692
Real-life doctor,
lived in New Hampshire, brilliant.

09:44.871 --> 09:49.165
And obsessed with alchemy,
especially how to live forever.

09:49.584 --> 09:51.790
So in 1816,
Doc abandons his practice...

09:51.961 --> 09:54.203
Right, yeah, nobody hears from him
for 20 years.

09:54.380 --> 09:55.874
And people start showing up dead.

09:56.049 --> 09:59.500
Dead or missing an organ, or a hand,
or some other kind of part.

09:59.677 --> 10:02.216
Whatever he was doing was working.
He kept on ticking.

10:02.389 --> 10:04.382
Parts would wear out,
he'd replace them.

10:04.558 --> 10:06.350
Dad hunted him and took his heart out.

10:06.518 --> 10:09.188
Yeah, I guess the doc
must've plugged in a new one.

10:10.981 --> 10:12.808
All right, where's he doing the deed?

10:12.983 --> 10:15.106
Benton's picky
about where he sets up his lab.

10:15.277 --> 10:16.819
He likes dense forest...

10:16.987 --> 10:19.905
...with access to a river or stream
or some kind of fresh water.

10:20.075 --> 10:21.699
- Why?
- Because that's where...

10:21.868 --> 10:25.913
...he likes to dump the bile,
and intestines, and fecal matter.

10:27.666 --> 10:29.742
Lost your appetite yet?

10:32.629 --> 10:34.705
Oh, baby, I can't stay mad at you.

11:54.840 --> 11:56.501
Shh.

12:07.854 --> 12:09.017
No, please.

12:11.316 --> 12:13.273
No, no.

12:22.286 --> 12:23.662
No.

12:23.830 --> 12:25.538
No.

12:50.957 --> 12:54.043
So these are all old hunting cabins.
They've been abandoned for years.

12:54.212 --> 12:55.622
Then what the hell we waiting for?

13:04.514 --> 13:07.680
- Bobby?
- Hey. I think I finally got a beat on Bela.

13:07.850 --> 13:10.424
<i>I'm listening.
- Rufus Turner.</i>

13:10.603 --> 13:12.478
Is that like a Cleveland Steamer?

13:12.648 --> 13:15.055
<i>He's a hunter, or used to be.
- And now?</i>

13:15.651 --> 13:17.940
Hermit, mostly.
Does a little selling on the side.

13:18.112 --> 13:21.397
Anyway,
I put the word out on Bela months ago.

13:21.573 --> 13:25.903
<i>He just called, said a woman
got in touch, wanted to buy some things.</i>

13:26.078 --> 13:28.035
<i>- And he thinks it's Bela?
British accent.</i>

13:28.205 --> 13:31.657
<i>- Went by the name Mina Chandler.
- She's used that before.</i>

13:31.835 --> 13:35.001
It's a sloppy move, getting in contact
with one of your old friends?

13:35.171 --> 13:38.172
Friend?
Haven't laid eyes on him in 15 years.

13:38.341 --> 13:42.968
And he's not the Christmas-card type.
I doubt she knows I know him.

13:43.138 --> 13:44.383
Canaan, Vermont.

13:44.556 --> 13:47.391
- Thanks, Bobby, we're on our way.
- One other thing.

13:47.559 --> 13:49.432
Take a bottle of Johnnie Walker Blue.

13:49.937 --> 13:51.515
Okay.

13:52.189 --> 13:53.269
We're going after Bela.

13:53.441 --> 13:56.145
- What? Whoa. Hold on a...
- Get your stuff, the clock's ticking.

13:56.319 --> 13:59.023
Look, I think we should stay here
and finish the case.

13:59.196 --> 14:01.272
- You insane?
- There's no way she has the Colt.

14:01.449 --> 14:04.366
That was months ago. She probably
sold it the second she got it.

14:04.535 --> 14:06.528
- Well, then I'll kill her. Win-win.
- Dean...

14:06.704 --> 14:08.032
Sam, we're going.

14:08.999 --> 14:10.577
- No.
- Why the hell not?

14:10.751 --> 14:14.451
Dean, this here, now.
This is what's gonna save you.

14:14.630 --> 14:19.042
- What? Chasing some Frankenstein?
- Chasing immortality.

14:20.886 --> 14:22.214
Look, Benton can't die.

14:22.387 --> 14:24.546
We find out how he did it,
we can do it to you.

14:24.723 --> 14:27.392
- What?
- You have to die before you go to hell.

14:27.560 --> 14:30.894
- So if you can never die...
- Wait, wait, wait. Wait a second.

14:33.107 --> 14:36.192
Did you know that this was Doc Benton
from the jump?

14:36.527 --> 14:38.070
No.

14:39.572 --> 14:42.359
- I was hoping...
- So the zombie thing, it was lying to me?

14:42.533 --> 14:45.867
I didn't wanna say anything until
I was sure. I'm trying to find an answer.

14:46.037 --> 14:49.621
No, what you're trying to do
is chase Slicey McHackey here.

14:49.792 --> 14:51.998
To kill him?
No, you wanna buy him a freaking beer.

14:52.169 --> 14:54.162
- You wanna study him.
- I was trying to help.

14:54.338 --> 14:58.383
You're not helping. You forget
that if I welch on this deal, you die.

14:58.550 --> 15:01.836
- Living forever is welching.
- Whatever the magic pill is, I'll take it.

15:02.012 --> 15:05.381
<i>Oh, what is this, Sid and Nancy?
No, it's just like Bobby's been saying.</i>

15:05.559 --> 15:08.310
We kill the demon that
holds the contract, this wipes clean.

15:08.478 --> 15:09.557
- That's our best shot.

15:09.729 --> 15:11.556
Even if you had the Colt,
who you gonna shoot?

15:11.731 --> 15:15.432
- We have no idea who holds the ticket.
- I'll shoot the Hellhounds then.

15:15.610 --> 15:17.603
- Now, you coming or not?
- I'm staying here.

15:19.698 --> 15:21.192
No, you're not.

15:21.366 --> 15:25.828
I'm not letting you wander in the woods
alone to track some organ-stealing freak.

15:25.997 --> 15:27.455
- You're not gonna let me?
- No.

15:27.623 --> 15:29.165
How are you gonna stop me?

15:31.335 --> 15:34.870
Look, man,
we're trying to do the same thing here.

15:38.593 --> 15:40.632
I know.

15:44.850 --> 15:46.095
But I'm going.

15:47.477 --> 15:51.178
So if you wanna stay, stay.

16:08.333 --> 16:10.325
Sammy, be careful.

16:14.005 --> 16:15.583
You too.

16:46.706 --> 16:48.450
<i>What?</i>

16:48.625 --> 16:50.499
Hi, uh, Rufus.

16:50.669 --> 16:53.670
Yeah, even if I am,
the question is still the same. What?

16:55.048 --> 16:57.420
Uh, I'm Dean Winchester,
I'm a friend of Bobby Singer's.

16:57.592 --> 16:59.087
<i>So?</i>

16:59.261 --> 17:02.049
<i>- You called him this morning.
So?</i>

17:04.099 --> 17:07.683
<i>Uh, ahem, you told Bobby about
a British chick, made contact with you.</i>

17:07.854 --> 17:10.558
Yeah, and so?
- Do you know where she is?

17:10.731 --> 17:13.269
<i>Yeah.
- Could you tell me where I could find her?</i>

17:13.443 --> 17:15.684
<i>No.
- Of course not.</i>

17:15.862 --> 17:17.237
Ahem, look, Rufus, man, heh...

17:19.742 --> 17:21.615
Look, let me point something out to you.

17:21.785 --> 17:24.074
You are knocking at my door,
so don't "look, man" me.

17:24.246 --> 17:26.286
I'm not your man.

17:26.707 --> 17:28.330
I'm sorry, sir.

17:28.500 --> 17:31.335
I'm gonna tell you a little story.
Once, Bobby called me.

17:31.503 --> 17:33.911
Asked me to call him
if I got a whiff of Bela Talbot.

17:34.089 --> 17:37.375
I got a whiff, I called. The end.

17:37.551 --> 17:41.217
If you could just tell me where she is,
I mean, that'd be great, heh.

17:41.389 --> 17:43.761
- Dean Winchester, right?
- Yeah.

17:43.933 --> 17:46.056
Dean, do I look like I'm here to help you?

17:47.103 --> 17:50.140
- I'm gonna say no, heh.
- Then get the hell off my property.

17:50.315 --> 17:54.443
All right, hey, fair enough.
I got one more question for you, though.

17:54.611 --> 17:58.562
See, I got this, ahem,
bottle of Scotch and, uh...

17:59.533 --> 18:01.443
Is this considered good?

18:06.457 --> 18:08.948
Well, bottoms up.

18:11.754 --> 18:16.583
You know, I don't even bother drinking
unless it's this stuff.

18:17.511 --> 18:21.129
- Nectar of the gods, I'm telling you.
- Yeah, it's a nice change, you know.

18:21.306 --> 18:23.465
Most of my whiskey
comes from a plastic jug.

18:26.228 --> 18:32.348
- So Bela was here because...?
- She wanted to buy a couple of things.

18:32.526 --> 18:34.852
Which is gonna take me
some time to round up.

18:35.029 --> 18:36.986
Where is she now?

18:38.574 --> 18:40.532
Kid, can I ask you something?

18:41.452 --> 18:44.489
- Sure.
- You got three weeks left.

18:44.664 --> 18:46.324
Why are you wasting your time...

18:46.499 --> 18:49.702
...chasing after that skinny,
stuck-up English girl?

18:53.339 --> 18:55.297
How do you know about that?

18:58.512 --> 19:00.635
Because I know things.

19:02.850 --> 19:06.930
I know a lot of things
about a lot of people.

19:07.479 --> 19:08.511
That so?

19:08.689 --> 19:11.809
I know ain't no pea shooter
gonna save you.

19:15.071 --> 19:17.562
What makes you so sure?

19:18.033 --> 19:20.025
Because that's the job, kid.

19:20.994 --> 19:22.951
Even if you manage
to scrape out of this one...

19:23.121 --> 19:26.704
...there's just gonna be something else
down the road.

19:26.875 --> 19:28.914
Folks like us...

19:29.419 --> 19:31.911
...there ain't no happy ending.

19:32.673 --> 19:35.164
We all got it coming.

19:38.721 --> 19:41.556
Well, ain't you a bucket of sunshine.

19:46.103 --> 19:49.104
I'm what you've got to look forward to
if you survive.

19:52.736 --> 19:54.859
Which you won't.

20:38.951 --> 20:40.944
So, Bela.

20:41.579 --> 20:46.157
Hotel Canaan. Room 39.

20:47.794 --> 20:49.205
But watch your back.

20:50.005 --> 20:51.415
I think I can handle Bela.

20:51.590 --> 20:53.463
Oh, don't be so sure about that.

20:54.009 --> 20:56.582
There are things
that you don't know about her.

20:57.554 --> 20:59.013
Oh, and you do?

20:59.181 --> 21:02.098
Right, because you know things.

21:02.726 --> 21:05.513
- Yep.
- Let me guess, you lift her fingerprint?

21:05.687 --> 21:07.313
Yep.

21:07.482 --> 21:10.151
- And that got you jack.
- Yep.

21:12.278 --> 21:14.318
She burned them off.

21:15.156 --> 21:17.362
Probably years ago.

21:17.533 --> 21:20.203
- Yeah, so you're right where we are.
- Nope.

21:25.041 --> 21:27.829
- You do her ear?
- Sorry?

21:28.670 --> 21:29.999
You do her ear?

21:30.172 --> 21:31.999
Did I do her...?

21:33.634 --> 21:37.583
Hey, man, I'll try anything once, but
I don't know, that sounds uncomfortable.

21:39.056 --> 21:41.973
Ears are as unique to humans
as fingerprints.

21:43.310 --> 21:44.341
No kidding.

21:44.520 --> 21:49.313
Course, that don't fly in the courts
over here, but in England?

21:49.484 --> 21:51.642
They're all over it.

21:53.947 --> 21:57.861
A friend of a friend of a friend...

21:58.034 --> 22:03.076
...faxed me 10 pages
of confidential files within a day.

22:03.248 --> 22:07.033
All I had to send him
was one clean shot off the security cam.

22:08.838 --> 22:10.296
Right.

22:11.048 --> 22:13.373
One clean shot of her ear.

22:29.234 --> 22:31.310
The so-called Bela Talbot.

24:56.973 --> 24:58.005
Shh, shh, shh.

24:58.183 --> 25:01.931
It's okay, I'm here to help you.
I'm here to help you, I'm gonna help you.

25:02.103 --> 25:03.432
Uh. Okay. Shh.

25:05.232 --> 25:06.892
Okay. Shh, shh, shh.

25:08.568 --> 25:09.766
Oh, God.

25:11.321 --> 25:13.563
Sorry. I'm sorry. Okay. Shh.

25:17.745 --> 25:18.776
Shh, shh, shh.

26:16.431 --> 26:19.266
Okay, watch your head.
Watch your head.

26:20.769 --> 26:22.311
Sorry.

26:31.573 --> 26:33.150
It's gonna be fine, I promise you.

27:19.956 --> 27:21.581
- Where's the Colt?
- Dean.

27:21.750 --> 27:23.707
No extra words.

27:23.877 --> 27:25.336
It's long gone.

27:25.503 --> 27:27.627
Across the world by now.

27:28.716 --> 27:31.503
- You're lying.
- I'll call the buyer. Speak Farsi?

27:32.887 --> 27:34.547
What the hell are you...?

27:34.722 --> 27:35.837
Don't flatter yourself.

27:38.851 --> 27:41.010
- Don't move.
- I told you, I don't have it.

27:41.437 --> 27:44.058
Oh, yeah, I'm definitely
gonna take your word for it.

27:53.408 --> 27:55.235
Don't move.

28:05.880 --> 28:07.588
It's gone.

28:08.466 --> 28:10.791
Get on a plane if you must.

28:13.138 --> 28:16.507
Track down the buyer.
You might catch up to him, eventually.

28:22.105 --> 28:24.430
- Are you going to kill me?
- Oh, yeah.

28:26.026 --> 28:29.645
- You're not the cold-blooded type.
- You mean, like you?

28:29.822 --> 28:31.102
It's true.

28:31.282 --> 28:33.654
See, I couldn't imagine
killing my parents.

28:35.870 --> 28:37.827
- I don't know what you're...
- Yes, you do.

28:39.248 --> 28:41.157
You were, what, 14?

28:41.667 --> 28:46.164
Your folks die in some shady accident,
police suspected a slashed brake line...

28:46.339 --> 28:48.628
...but it was all too crispy to tell.

28:48.800 --> 28:49.963
Cut to little Bela...

28:50.135 --> 28:52.174
I'm sorry. Abbie.

28:53.013 --> 28:55.136
- Inheriting millions.

28:55.307 --> 28:57.595
- How did you even...?
- Doesn't matter.

29:22.753 --> 29:24.746
They were lovely people.

29:25.130 --> 29:26.328
And I killed them.

29:28.300 --> 29:29.960
And I got rich.

29:30.135 --> 29:32.009
I can't be bothered to give a damn.

29:33.889 --> 29:35.965
Just like I don't care
what happens to you.

29:44.859 --> 29:47.018
You make me sick.

29:48.613 --> 29:50.024
Likewise.

30:16.017 --> 30:17.392
You're not worth it.

30:47.300 --> 30:48.794
It worked.

30:48.968 --> 30:50.676
He found me.

30:51.763 --> 30:54.051
No, Sam wasn't with him.

30:54.849 --> 30:56.094
But I know where they are.

31:02.441 --> 31:03.686
- Dean?
- Yeah.

31:03.859 --> 31:06.101
<i>You get the Colt?
- What do you think?</i>

31:06.278 --> 31:08.187
<i>- So does that mean Bela is, uh...?
No, no.</i>

31:08.364 --> 31:10.937
She deserves to die a dozen times over,
but I couldn't do it.

31:11.116 --> 31:12.990
<i>Dean...
- I'm really screwed, Sammy.</i>

31:13.160 --> 31:16.281
<i>- No, you're just...
- You were right, Bela was a goose chase.</i>

31:18.041 --> 31:21.624
The Colt's gone.
And this time I'm really screwed, Sam.

31:21.795 --> 31:23.704
Maybe not.

31:24.130 --> 31:25.459
<i>Dean, I found Benton's cabin.</i>

31:25.632 --> 31:27.506
<i>- You okay? Was he there?
Yeah.</i>

31:27.676 --> 31:28.755
<i>- Did you kill him?
No.</i>

31:28.927 --> 31:30.966
<i>- What do you mean, no?
Listen for a second.</i>

31:31.137 --> 31:33.711
I found his lab book
and it has the formula.

31:33.890 --> 31:35.848
<i>What, the live-forever formula?
- Yeah.</i>

31:36.018 --> 31:38.640
Let me guess,
I gotta drink blood out of a baby's skull?

31:38.813 --> 31:45.527
No, that's the thing, it's not black magic.
There's no blood sacrifice or anything.

31:45.695 --> 31:47.189
It's just science, Dean.

31:47.363 --> 31:50.483
<i>Very, very,
extremely weird science, but...</i>

31:50.658 --> 31:53.945
<i>- Wait, what are you saying? You think...?
I think it might be doable.</i>

31:54.121 --> 31:58.165
I know we've hit a lot of walls, but
I think this formula, I think it might be it.

31:58.709 --> 32:00.666
<i>This could save you.</i>

32:00.836 --> 32:02.330
Okay, so this formula...

32:02.504 --> 32:06.122
Look, we're not in the clear yet,
there are still things that I don't get...

32:07.509 --> 32:09.169
Sam?

32:12.974 --> 32:14.053
<i>Sammy?</i>

32:26.696 --> 32:29.021
You can relax.

32:29.199 --> 32:30.776
It's all gonna be okay.

32:30.950 --> 32:34.783
Ain't nothing gonna happen here
that you got to worry about, Sammy.

32:34.955 --> 32:39.000
And your chances of coming out
of this procedure alive...

32:39.168 --> 32:40.911
...very, very high.

32:41.545 --> 32:42.826
How do you know my name?

32:44.256 --> 32:45.916
Oh.

32:47.551 --> 32:48.666
I know.

32:50.597 --> 32:53.598
You think I'm some kind of monster,
don't you?

32:53.767 --> 32:59.971
Well, I gotta tell you, I have never done
one thing that I did not have to do.

33:00.148 --> 33:05.522
This whole eternal life thing
is very high-maintenance.

33:07.739 --> 33:13.695
Something goes bad, like my eyes here,
you gotta replace them.

33:19.085 --> 33:24.672
And sometimes, things get damaged,
like when your father cut out my heart.

33:24.841 --> 33:26.086
Now, that...

33:26.259 --> 33:29.842
That was very inconvenient.

33:32.558 --> 33:38.347
So I'm sure that you can understand
all the joy I felt...

33:38.522 --> 33:43.896
...when I read all about myself here
in his journal.

33:49.617 --> 33:52.287
Kind of makes this whole thing...

33:53.163 --> 33:57.291
...just feel like some kind
of family reunion, don't it?

33:59.127 --> 34:05.414
Well, I guess it's about time
that we get this thing started.

34:21.692 --> 34:24.183
Shoot all you want.

34:43.632 --> 34:45.958
A knife?

34:47.844 --> 34:52.638
What part of immortality
do you not understand?

34:56.437 --> 34:59.557
Pity about the heart, though.

34:59.732 --> 35:02.603
It was a brand-new one.

35:02.777 --> 35:04.356
Good.

35:04.530 --> 35:06.653
Should be pumping nice and strong.

35:07.992 --> 35:11.941
Sending this stuff
throughout your whole body.

35:12.871 --> 35:16.620
See, I picked up your little bottle upstairs
and dipped the knife in it.

35:31.391 --> 35:32.850
Oh, hiya, Doc.

35:34.436 --> 35:36.927
Wakey wakey eggs and bakey.

35:38.690 --> 35:40.517
- Please.
Please what?

35:40.692 --> 35:43.694
You've been killing for over 150 years
and now you got a request?

35:43.863 --> 35:46.568
- Shut up.
- You don't understand, I can help you.

35:46.741 --> 35:48.698
I know what you need.

35:48.868 --> 35:52.237
I'm gonna have to cut him into bits.
This immortality thing is a bitch.

35:52.413 --> 35:55.200
I can read the formula for you.

35:56.334 --> 35:59.667
You know, immortality...

35:59.837 --> 36:03.124
...forever young, never die.

36:10.265 --> 36:11.724
Dean.

36:13.852 --> 36:15.512
Sam.

36:21.861 --> 36:23.521
What?

36:25.949 --> 36:29.152
We're talking hell in three weeks or
needing a new pancreas in half a century.

36:29.327 --> 36:31.201
You can't exactly get those
at a Kwik-E-Mart.

36:31.371 --> 36:34.122
It's not perfect, but it buys us time
to think of something better.

36:34.290 --> 36:38.537
We just need time, Dean.
I mean, please, just think about it.

36:42.258 --> 36:43.668
No.

36:44.093 --> 36:46.002
- Don't you wanna live?
- He isn't living.

36:46.178 --> 36:47.459
- This is simple.
- Simple?

36:47.638 --> 36:51.470
To me it is, okay?
Black or white. Human, not human.

36:52.351 --> 36:55.554
You see, what the doc is...
He's a freaking monster.

36:56.021 --> 36:57.302
I can't do it.

36:58.108 --> 37:00.100
I would rather go to hell.

37:00.277 --> 37:03.527
You don't understand. I can help you.

37:07.117 --> 37:08.576
Now, I'm gonna take care of him.

37:09.327 --> 37:12.032
You can either help me or not.
It's up to you.

37:42.362 --> 37:45.233
No, no. Don't be stupid!

37:45.407 --> 37:47.732
I can help you. No.

37:47.910 --> 37:51.492
Enjoy forever in there, Doc.
I can save you.

37:51.663 --> 37:54.368
Let me out! Let me out!

37:54.541 --> 37:55.705
Let me out!

37:55.877 --> 37:59.957
Let me out. I can save you!

38:00.131 --> 38:03.714
No, don't! Don't!

38:05.678 --> 38:08.348
No, let me out, let me out.

38:08.515 --> 38:12.049
Let me out, let me out, let me out.

38:12.227 --> 38:15.063
No!

39:16.587 --> 39:17.749
<i>Hiya, Bela.</i>

39:17.921 --> 39:19.831
<i>Here's a fun fact you may not know.</i>

39:20.007 --> 39:23.127
<i>I felt your hand in my pocket
when you swiped that motel receipt.</i>

39:23.302 --> 39:26.920
- You don't understand.
- I'm pretty sure I understand perfectly.

39:27.097 --> 39:29.635
I noticed something interesting
in your hotel room.

39:29.809 --> 39:31.517
<i>Something tucked above the door.</i>

39:31.686 --> 39:34.224
<i>An herb. Devil's shoestring?</i>

39:35.106 --> 39:36.814
<i>Well, there's only one use for that.</i>

39:37.525 --> 39:39.767
Holding Hellhounds at bay.

39:39.944 --> 39:42.649
I went back and I took another look
at your folks' obit.

39:42.822 --> 39:46.274
<i>Turns out, they died 10 years ago today.</i>

39:46.451 --> 39:48.076
You didn't kill them.

39:48.244 --> 39:49.823
A demon did your dirty work.

39:49.997 --> 39:53.497
<i>You made a deal, didn't you, Bela?</i>

39:53.668 --> 39:55.541
<i>And it's come due.</i>

40:01.300 --> 40:03.708
I can take care of them for you.

40:05.638 --> 40:08.094
And it won't even cost you anything...

40:09.977 --> 40:12.847
...for 10 whole years.

40:18.986 --> 40:21.737
<i>So is that why you stole the Colt, huh?</i>

40:21.905 --> 40:23.364
<i>Try to wiggle out of your deal?</i>

40:23.532 --> 40:25.524
<i>- Our gun for your soul?
- Yes.</i>

40:25.701 --> 40:28.027
But stealing the Colt
wasn't quite enough, I'm guessing.

40:28.580 --> 40:30.738
They changed the deal.

40:31.291 --> 40:32.951
They wanted me to kill Sam.

40:33.126 --> 40:36.329
Really? Wow. Demons untrustworthy.

40:36.504 --> 40:38.497
Ha. Shocker.

40:38.673 --> 40:40.416
That's, uh, kind of a tight deadline too.

40:40.592 --> 40:45.337
<i>Uh, what time is it?
Oh, look at that, almost midnight.</i>

40:45.763 --> 40:47.674
Dean, listen, I need help.

40:47.850 --> 40:51.017
- Sweetheart, we are weeks past help.
- I know I don't deserve it.

40:51.186 --> 40:53.938
You're right, you don't. But you know
what the bitch of the bunch is?

40:54.106 --> 40:57.142
<i>If you would've just come to us
sooner and asked for help...</i>

40:57.318 --> 41:00.069
<i>...we probably could've taken the Colt
and saved you.</i>

41:00.237 --> 41:04.187
I know, and saved yourself.
I know about your deal, Dean.

41:04.825 --> 41:06.071
And who told you that?

41:06.244 --> 41:09.696
The demon that holds it.
She holds mine too.

41:09.873 --> 41:11.332
She says she holds every deal.

41:11.499 --> 41:13.243
- She?
- Her name's Lilith.

41:14.336 --> 41:15.878
Lilith?

41:17.214 --> 41:18.708
Why should I believe you?

41:19.758 --> 41:21.382
You shouldn't, but it's the truth.

41:21.551 --> 41:25.384
This can't help you, Bela. Not now.
Why are you telling me this?

41:26.432 --> 41:28.888
Because just maybe
you can kill the bitch.

41:33.356 --> 41:34.387
I'll see you in hell.
