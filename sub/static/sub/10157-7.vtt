WEBVTT

00:08.009 --> 00:09.594
There she comes.

00:10.595 --> 00:12.221
There it is, moving on down.

00:13.347 --> 00:16.475
Ooh, it's good.
I needed the car wash, man. Yikes!

00:18.061 --> 00:20.104
That was a dirty, dirty car.

00:20.188 --> 00:22.899
My backseat looked
like a water bottle graveyard.

00:23.817 --> 00:26.778
What do we got here?
What about these air fresheners?

00:26.861 --> 00:28.362
You got one, like, to recommend?

00:28.446 --> 00:32.491
Any smells that are, like,
I don't know, sexy or...

00:32.576 --> 00:35.453
Is that weird to ask?
Is there, like, a sexy smell?

00:37.496 --> 00:39.624
I think maybe piña colada?

00:39.708 --> 00:43.252
Okay. Yeah, look at that.

00:43.336 --> 00:45.379
Yeah, it smells like suntan lotion.

00:45.463 --> 00:50.009
Yeah, I could see how that would work.
Sort of, people get associations of...

00:50.093 --> 00:54.472
suntan lotion, beaches,
bikinis, skin... yeah.

00:54.556 --> 00:56.349
Yeah, no, we're just...

00:56.432 --> 00:58.977
I'm picking up a girl in the car
and, you know,

00:59.060 --> 01:01.395
I want my car to smell good.
I don't want it to smell bad.

01:01.479 --> 01:03.565
-Yeah.
-That's a bad first start.

01:03.648 --> 01:05.441
What else we got here, uh...

01:05.524 --> 01:08.737
- Guys, Gus is coming over...
- soon.

01:08.820 --> 01:09.946
Yay.

01:10.029 --> 01:13.407
- Who's Gus?
- He's this guy I think I might be into...

01:13.491 --> 01:16.077
-Do you have butterflies?
-Oh, yeah, I have butterflies,

01:16.160 --> 01:19.413
and I have a heart murmur,
and I got the Hershey squirts.

01:19.497 --> 01:22.917
-But I thought you liked him.
-I do.

01:23.001 --> 01:25.336
I do. He's different.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.881
He's-- I think he might be
a little bit boring.

01:27.964 --> 01:28.965
Yeah, I mean, we've...

01:29.048 --> 01:31.635
She and I have, like,
talked before, you know.

01:31.718 --> 01:34.512
We've interacted and, like,
texted and stuff, but, like,

01:34.595 --> 01:37.556
I feel like that's, like,
a little more workshopped?

01:37.641 --> 01:39.308
-Mmm.
-You know, but this is like,

01:39.392 --> 01:41.019
-this is real life, you know.
-Yeah.

01:41.102 --> 01:43.229
- You can't workshop that, you know.
- Yeah.

01:43.312 --> 01:44.731
Yeah. Yeah.

01:49.903 --> 01:51.529
People seem to like pine.

01:51.613 --> 01:53.948
Pine! Okay, yeah.

01:54.032 --> 01:57.451
I like Gus. I feel like he's different.
He's cool without trying.

01:57.535 --> 01:58.912
Or even knowing.

01:58.995 --> 02:00.496
He's definitely afraid to fuck me.

02:00.579 --> 02:02.248
Oh, God, no. That's no good.

02:02.331 --> 02:04.125
I went through a phase
where I was really loving

02:04.208 --> 02:06.419
having sex with very unattractive men.

02:06.502 --> 02:09.047
Oh, yeah, that was my move.
All women go through that phase.

02:09.130 --> 02:11.174
-Really?
-Yeah.

02:11.257 --> 02:13.467
You know, uh, Sam Kinison?

02:13.551 --> 02:15.219
That comedian that screamed a lot?

02:15.303 --> 02:17.430
-He didn't scream with me.
-No!

02:17.513 --> 02:19.974
In fairness, though,
he had laryngitis, I think.

02:20.058 --> 02:23.687
I once had sex with a guy whose dick
was so small, I thought it was a clitoris.

02:23.770 --> 02:24.813
Hmm... Gus!

02:24.896 --> 02:27.481
-Hey. Hi.
-Oh, my God, Gus. Well, hello.

02:27.565 --> 02:30.694
- We were just talking about Christmas!
- Oh, cool.

02:30.777 --> 02:33.822
- This is Syd, our neighbor/friend.
- Hi, Syd.

02:33.905 --> 02:35.573
-Hello.
-Hi.

02:36.407 --> 02:37.533
You guys just all hanging out?

02:37.616 --> 02:38.617
- Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah.

02:38.702 --> 02:42.706
I like it. It's like when, uh,
my sister would have, like, a sleepover.

02:42.789 --> 02:44.540
A cool vibe to, like, walk into.

02:44.623 --> 02:47.501
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

02:47.585 --> 02:50.463
Do you wanna... hang out inside?

02:50.546 --> 02:53.341
-Uh, yeah, sure. Cool. All right.
-This way.

02:53.424 --> 02:55.218
- Nice to meet you. Good to see you.
- Good to meet you.

02:55.301 --> 02:57.220
Have fun, you guys.

02:59.138 --> 03:01.390
So, what do you got going
on the rest of the day?

03:01.474 --> 03:04.018
Oh, I'm going to book club.
We're reading Dianetics.

03:04.102 --> 03:05.686
We just want to see what it is.

03:07.021 --> 03:08.272
Okay.

03:30.962 --> 03:33.464
- You want something to drink?
- Yeah.

03:33.547 --> 03:37.761
- Thanks.
- Got water, juice, milk...

03:37.844 --> 03:40.554
Um, I'm good for some milk.

03:40.638 --> 03:42.056
-Okay.
-Sure.

03:43.641 --> 03:45.434
Thank you.

03:45.518 --> 03:49.939
My grandma used to pour a big glass
of milk and make me drink the whole thing

03:50.023 --> 03:53.067
- 'cause she was from the Depression.
- Oh.

03:53.151 --> 03:56.780
Ooh.
I think this milk's gone bad.

03:56.863 --> 04:00.366
Oh, shit! That was in there to remind me
to get new milk. I'm sorry.

04:00.449 --> 04:01.492
You know what you should do?

04:01.575 --> 04:04.078
You should just throw out the milk,
so, like, the absence of milk

04:04.162 --> 04:06.580
is the thing that reminds you
to get milk, you know?

04:06.664 --> 04:08.291
Well, that's just our system.

04:08.374 --> 04:10.418
I mean, this is the first time
it's backfired.

04:10.501 --> 04:13.922
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.
Or you could just... empty out the milk

04:14.005 --> 04:17.175
and then just have an empty container
in there and, you know, go...

04:17.258 --> 04:19.052
"Oh, right, empty container,
gotta get milk."

04:19.135 --> 04:21.095
--Do you want some water?

04:21.179 --> 04:22.680
Yeah! That'd be great.

04:27.268 --> 04:30.021
- Thank you.
- I have a question.

04:30.104 --> 04:32.690
-Mmm-hmm.
-Are you afraid of bugs?

04:32.774 --> 04:35.068
There are bugs under those cups
and I can't kill 'em.

04:36.319 --> 04:37.821
'Cause it's, like, inhumane or...

04:37.904 --> 04:40.489
Ew, no. No, because they're gross
and I hate them!

04:40.573 --> 04:41.991
Inhumane?

04:42.075 --> 04:43.576
All right.

04:43.659 --> 04:45.744
All right, well, uh...

04:45.829 --> 04:48.164
Let's see what we're
dealing with, huh? Okay.

04:48.247 --> 04:49.623
No! Wait, wait, wait!

04:49.707 --> 04:52.585
I don't know which of those are secretly
alive and which of them can fly,

04:52.668 --> 04:55.046
and what if they fly into my face
and they sting me?

04:56.047 --> 04:57.715
What kind of bugs do you think
you're dealing with here?

04:57.799 --> 05:02.720
Every bug can fly, is poisonous,
and has Ebola until it's proven innocent.

05:02.804 --> 05:05.264
Okay. Hey, it's okay.
You can just, um...

05:05.348 --> 05:06.891
Can you get some tissues?

05:06.975 --> 05:08.434
-Yeah.
-All right.

05:12.480 --> 05:14.315
-Thank you.
-I'll be back here.

05:14.398 --> 05:15.649
Okay. Yeah.

05:15.733 --> 05:17.318
- I think that's a good distance.

05:17.401 --> 05:19.153
-Um...
-Be careful!

05:19.237 --> 05:22.281
- I will. All right. Ready?
- Yeah.

05:22.365 --> 05:23.449
Okay.

05:23.532 --> 05:24.909
Did you get it?

05:24.993 --> 05:26.119
- Yeah, I got it.

05:26.202 --> 05:29.622
Aw. You hear that crushing sound?
It's satisfying.

05:29.705 --> 05:30.915
You should come closer so you can...

05:30.999 --> 05:34.836
-Mmm-mmm. That's good. It's okay.
-...hear this nice bone-crunching sound.

05:36.545 --> 05:38.256
-Did you get it? Did you get it?
-Yep. Yep.

05:38.339 --> 05:39.840
-Okay.
-He's dead.

05:39.924 --> 05:42.260
-Whew.
-He's dead. This feels really good.

05:42.343 --> 05:43.970
My heart is racing.

05:44.053 --> 05:46.680
My heart is racing 'cause I'm excited.

05:47.723 --> 05:49.433
Uh...

05:49.517 --> 05:51.352
-Okay.
-Oh, shit! I saw that one.

05:51.435 --> 05:52.853
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I saw it too.

05:52.937 --> 05:54.898
--And it's gross. Okay.

05:54.981 --> 05:58.526
All right. So I'm gonna bring
these guys all together.

05:59.193 --> 06:00.653
That's it? You got 'em all?

06:00.736 --> 06:02.571
All right.

06:02.655 --> 06:05.574
Okay.
I'm gonna, like, flush these.

06:05.658 --> 06:07.743
- Okay.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.999
--Took care of 'em.

06:13.082 --> 06:14.542
That was kinda hot.

06:14.625 --> 06:18.712
-Yeah? You think so?
-Yeah. You handled those fuckers.

06:40.068 --> 06:41.860
-Wow.
-Wow.

07:01.380 --> 07:02.798
You had your eyes open.

07:02.881 --> 07:04.467
-I know.
-I did, too.

07:04.550 --> 07:06.427
-So what?
-Yeah, well, that's okay.

07:06.510 --> 07:09.638
-Okay.
-I just want you to not be in pain.

07:09.722 --> 07:11.682
- I'm not in pain.
- Okay, okay.

07:39.460 --> 07:42.421
I should've never
set you up with Bertie.

07:42.505 --> 07:44.757
- Oh, it's totally cool.
- Okay.

07:53.599 --> 07:56.019
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Yeah? You want to?

07:56.102 --> 07:59.230
-Yes. It's okay.
-Okay, okay.

08:01.607 --> 08:03.776
- Let me just... Okay.
- Okay.

08:03.859 --> 08:05.903
--Okay.

08:05.987 --> 08:07.696
--Okay.

08:20.959 --> 08:24.130
There's a high school around the block.
Marching band practice.

08:24.213 --> 08:25.298
Mmm.

08:26.799 --> 08:28.426
I like it.

08:30.011 --> 08:31.179
Me, too.

08:31.262 --> 08:32.846
So, hey, you wanna...

08:32.930 --> 08:35.599
get something to eat?
You hungry?

08:35.683 --> 08:39.645
-I'm starving.
-Yeah... Let's go out.

08:39.728 --> 08:42.981
Don't you just want to stay in
and order a pizza?

08:45.859 --> 08:50.281
No, I... think I might have
some plans for us.

08:50.364 --> 08:52.158
Oh, that's right.

08:52.241 --> 08:54.368
-You had a whole date planned.
-Yeah.

08:55.536 --> 08:57.080
Can I guess?

08:57.163 --> 08:58.664
-Uh, where we're going?
-Yeah.

08:59.707 --> 09:01.959
-Okay.
-Hollywood Bowl.

09:03.086 --> 09:04.378
No.

09:04.462 --> 09:06.547
That would've been good, but no.

09:07.590 --> 09:11.969
Actually, the place I'm taking you to
has a dress code.

09:12.053 --> 09:15.473
--So, I gotta get my suit out of the car.

09:15.556 --> 09:16.932
-Oh.
-So...

09:17.015 --> 09:20.269
I think I know where it is.
Can I guess? Okay. Um...

09:22.896 --> 09:25.399
Suit, eh? You're wearing a suit?

09:25.483 --> 09:28.152
Is it Disneyland's Club 33?

09:28.236 --> 09:29.612
What's that?

09:29.695 --> 09:32.740
A private club at Disneyland
where Walt used to...

09:32.823 --> 09:34.575
ladies.

09:34.658 --> 09:38.912
Oh. Yeah. It's, like, that restaurant
at the park, right?

09:38.996 --> 09:42.458
Yeah, I don't think Walt Disney, like...
ladies.

09:43.626 --> 09:47.171
- Really?
- Oh, yeah, all the time.

09:47.255 --> 09:49.673
Wow! Okay. Well, that's cool.

09:49.757 --> 09:51.217
-Mmm-hmm.
-All right.

09:51.300 --> 09:52.718
You wanna get dressed?

09:52.801 --> 09:55.263
I don't know what the dress code is.
You pick out my outfit.

09:55.346 --> 09:58.391
-You want me to pick out your clothes?
-Dealer's choice.

09:59.225 --> 10:00.976
-You look great.
-Aw, thanks.

10:03.104 --> 10:06.982
- Kinda chilly.
- Yeah, right? Chilly beans.

10:07.065 --> 10:08.567
That's what my dad
used to say all the time.

10:08.651 --> 10:12.405
- He'd go...
- "Chilly beans." Uh.

10:12.488 --> 10:13.572
-Oh.
-Let me get that.

10:13.656 --> 10:16.200
-All right.
-Let me be chivalrous, huh?

10:16.284 --> 10:18.494
Let me have old, weird, gender stuff.

10:18.577 --> 10:20.454
--Okay?

10:27.961 --> 10:30.298
I cried in front
of Natalie, like, a million times,

10:30.381 --> 10:31.882
and she cried in front of me, like,
zero times.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.384
Damn it.

10:34.593 --> 10:36.262
I, uh...

10:37.180 --> 10:38.972
I record my therapy sessions.

10:44.770 --> 10:48.065
- Do you smell piña colada?
- Yeah.

10:48.149 --> 10:50.818
Yeah, I got an air freshener
at the car wash.

10:50.901 --> 10:52.445
This is taking me back.

10:52.528 --> 10:55.198
I feel like I'm in my math teacher's car,
Mr. Eldi.

10:55.281 --> 10:58.742
Yeah, totally.
I mean, uh... Wait.

10:58.826 --> 11:01.245
You would ride around in a car
with your math teacher?

11:01.329 --> 11:04.290
Yeah, we would go shopping
or whatever after school.

11:05.333 --> 11:08.169
Shopping?
What...

11:08.252 --> 11:11.255
What sort of stuff would you go shopping
for with your math teacher?

11:11.339 --> 11:12.423
I don't know.

11:13.424 --> 11:16.051
-Uh, what?
-Oh, my God, that is weird.

11:16.134 --> 11:17.720
-Yeah.
-No, he was great!

11:17.803 --> 11:19.513
He was, like, my favorite teacher.

11:19.597 --> 11:20.931
-He was a good guy.
-Mmm-hmm.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.433
We were... friends, right?

11:22.516 --> 11:26.019
I guess.
I mean, he didn't, like, try anything--

11:26.103 --> 11:28.522
-No! No, we were buddies.
-No? Okay. Okay.

11:28.606 --> 11:31.317
Yeah, and your parents
were okay with it, too? Like--

11:31.400 --> 11:34.027
No, they loved him.
They thought he was great.

11:34.111 --> 11:35.238
Oh.

11:35.321 --> 11:39.325
God. Should I call my mom right now
and ask her if I was molested?

11:39.408 --> 11:40.701
No.

11:41.910 --> 11:44.455
Unless you think you should or...

11:44.538 --> 11:45.539
Nah.

11:58.636 --> 12:01.680
- Are you cold?
- I'm always cold.

12:03.599 --> 12:04.975
What do your parents do for a living?

12:05.058 --> 12:06.685
Um...

12:06.769 --> 12:09.229
My dad's a non-practicing dentist
and my mom is--

12:09.313 --> 12:12.358
Non-practicing? What do you mean?
What's that?

12:12.441 --> 12:15.694
Ugh. You know, it's a long story.
I'll tell you some other time.

12:15.778 --> 12:19.197
- Um, my mom's an interior designer.
- Ah.

12:19.282 --> 12:23.201
Is she a, um, what's it called...
uh, a tetrachromat?

12:23.286 --> 12:24.287
What?

12:24.370 --> 12:28.165
They're, like, people who can see, like,
more colors than normal people.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.876
Like, you know, more than just ROYGBIV.

12:30.959 --> 12:32.628
Well, who's Roy G. Biv?

12:32.711 --> 12:35.255
Oh, he's not a person.
ROYGBIV is, like...

12:35.339 --> 12:37.132
I don't know, like, an acronym.

12:37.215 --> 12:40.844
ROYGBIV. Red, orange, yellow,
green, blue, indigo--

12:40.928 --> 12:42.137
Are you making this up?

12:42.220 --> 12:43.806
No.

12:43.889 --> 12:45.349
Why, you've never heard of that before?

12:45.433 --> 12:46.892
I remember learning that
as a kid in school.

12:46.975 --> 12:48.311
Must be a South Dakota thing.

12:48.394 --> 12:52.731
In Jersey, all we got to learn was FBI
stands for "Female Body Inspector."

12:52.815 --> 12:54.983
Yeah. I think I've seen that shirt before.

12:55.859 --> 13:00.656
But yeah, anyway, tetrachromats,
you know, are, a lot of times, um, women.

13:00.739 --> 13:02.950
-Mmm.
-And artists.

13:03.033 --> 13:05.160
That's why I thought with your mom,
maybe she, uh...

13:05.243 --> 13:07.705
Yeah, I don't think she has that ability.

13:07.788 --> 13:10.207
Oh, oh. Okay.

13:10.290 --> 13:14.294
So, what're you looking at?
What sounds good?

13:14.378 --> 13:19.299
I think I'm gonna get this avocado wrap
but with the ponzu sauce.

13:19.383 --> 13:20.968
Ah.

13:21.051 --> 13:22.345
Can I take your order?

13:22.428 --> 13:25.848
Uh, yeah, can I get that
but with the ponzu sauce?

13:25.931 --> 13:28.809
Only the garlic chicken
comes with the ponzu.

13:28.892 --> 13:30.811
Chef's orders.

13:31.354 --> 13:34.064
Okay, then I guess I'll get it
without the sauce.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.608
But just so you know,
that's kinda unfair.

13:35.691 --> 13:40.654
Uh, yeah, I'll get the, uh,
the vegetable tempura, please,

13:40.738 --> 13:42.365
and, um...

13:42.448 --> 13:46.619
can I also get the garlic chicken
with the ponzu sauce?

13:46.702 --> 13:48.371
-Okay.
-Thank you.

13:51.415 --> 13:52.833
You know, I didn't even want
the garlic chicken.

13:52.916 --> 13:54.585
I just got it for the ponzu for you.

13:54.668 --> 13:59.798
What? Gus, that's, like, the nicest thing
anybody's ever done for me.

13:59.882 --> 14:01.467
Hey, a girl's gotta have her sauce, right?

14:12.185 --> 14:13.437
Hey.

14:18.359 --> 14:21.236
Wow. That was a long time.

14:21.319 --> 14:24.031
It was a long pee. Shut up.
Don't pay attention to that.

14:24.114 --> 14:25.533
Okay, sorry.

14:25.616 --> 14:28.452
Now you got me feeling all goofy
that I even...

14:28.536 --> 14:31.455
said anything.

14:31.539 --> 14:34.124
Um, hey, uh...

14:34.207 --> 14:36.835
So, I wanted to ask you.

14:36.919 --> 14:38.879
Have you ever been to The Magic Castle?

14:39.505 --> 14:42.049
No, don't you need a special invitation
or something?

14:42.132 --> 14:46.136
Lucky for you... guess what I am.

14:48.472 --> 14:50.724
A member.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.937
-I'm not really that into magic.
-That's okay.

14:55.020 --> 14:59.357
You know...
just a whole castle devoted to it.

14:59.442 --> 15:01.402
Why don't we just go to a bar?

15:01.485 --> 15:03.529
We can just go there for the bar,
you know.

15:03.612 --> 15:07.074
Hey, trust me,
if we go there, you don't like it,

15:07.157 --> 15:09.076
just let me know,
we can take off.

15:10.619 --> 15:12.079
Okay. That's fair.

15:12.162 --> 15:15.499
See, the thing with Ricky Jay is,
he's, like, basically at the top

15:15.583 --> 15:17.835
of the cool pyramid, you know,
of magicians.

15:17.918 --> 15:22.089
Tonight, you know, what you're
gonna see is, like, the real shit.

15:22.172 --> 15:26.343
When you say "real magic,"
you still mean it's all fake, though.

15:28.053 --> 15:30.431
Right. They don't do, like, real magic.

15:30.514 --> 15:32.808
It's not like they're wizards
or something.

15:34.017 --> 15:36.854
Ideally, you want to do a trick
better than everyone else, you know,

15:36.937 --> 15:39.523
make it your own,
put your own personal stamp on it.

15:42.776 --> 15:44.152
- Thank you.
- Watch your step.

15:44.236 --> 15:46.489
-Ugh, Jesus.
-And it's like, if you think about it,

15:46.572 --> 15:48.281
in a way, you know...

15:49.199 --> 15:51.910
magic's almost like
a form of performance art, you know.

15:52.995 --> 15:55.748
Let me ask you a question
and please answer honestly.

15:55.831 --> 15:56.832
Okay.

15:56.915 --> 16:00.377
Is this your way of telling...
Are you a magician?

16:01.336 --> 16:06.049
I know it may seem that way,
but rest assured, I am merely a fan.

16:06.133 --> 16:07.593
Okay, phew.

16:12.222 --> 16:15.476
-Welcome home.
-Aw, thank you.

16:15.559 --> 16:17.019
After you.

16:17.102 --> 16:18.854
Thanks, Don, Carlos.

16:20.898 --> 16:24.902
No way. Uh-uh.
Oh, no, how'd you do that?

16:27.821 --> 16:29.114
What?

16:29.948 --> 16:31.575
Where's it gone?

16:32.660 --> 16:34.119
Oh, Lord.

16:34.202 --> 16:35.412
You're good!

16:35.496 --> 16:37.540
- Gus.
- Uh-huh?

16:37.623 --> 16:39.625
You have to check out this woman.
She's amazing.

16:40.417 --> 16:43.712
- There it is! What?
- Easy come, easy go!

16:43.796 --> 16:47.675
-She's, like, amazed by everything.
-Uh-huh. She's into it, huh?

16:47.758 --> 16:51.637
I want to follow her around all night
and see magic through her eyes.

16:51.720 --> 16:55.473
How's that happening? No!

16:55.558 --> 16:56.975
Follow me.
I want to show you something cool.

16:57.059 --> 16:59.144
-Okay. All right.
-Come here, come here, come here. Yeah.

17:00.729 --> 17:02.355
You coming?

17:09.446 --> 17:11.990
-Ooh!
-Ooh, cool! A player piano.

17:12.074 --> 17:14.743
Oh, no, no, no.
That's playing on its own.

17:14.827 --> 17:16.620
What do you mean?

17:16.704 --> 17:20.165
That's Irma. She's, like,
the resident piano-playing ghost.

17:21.291 --> 17:22.585
-Cool!
-Uh-huh.

17:22.668 --> 17:25.337
Hey, let's go stalk
that, uh, super excited lady.

17:25.420 --> 17:27.923
No, you should ask her to play a song.

17:28.006 --> 17:30.759
-She does anything. It's cool, any song.
-Anything?

17:30.843 --> 17:32.595
Give it a try.

17:32.678 --> 17:33.929
Request something, come on.

17:36.014 --> 17:37.641
-Oh, I got one. I got it. Yeah.
-You got it? Okay.

17:38.433 --> 17:42.312
Hey, uh, ghost piano,
play, uh, "Blister in the Sun."

17:45.941 --> 17:47.150
It doesn't know "Blister In The Sun"?

17:47.234 --> 17:49.653
That's, like, the one Violent Femmes song
everybody knows.

17:49.737 --> 17:53.281
Um... I don't think
her name's Ghost Piano Lady.

17:53.365 --> 17:54.700
--So just try it again.

17:54.783 --> 17:56.577
Just, like, ask politely.

17:59.162 --> 18:01.790
- Miss Irma, would you please play--

18:01.874 --> 18:04.668
See? Yeah.

18:06.003 --> 18:09.882
♪ When I'm out walkin'
I strut my stuff and I'm so strung out ♪

18:09.965 --> 18:14.469
♪ I'm high as a kite
I just might stop to check you out ♪

18:14.552 --> 18:19.391
♪ Let me go on
Like a blister in the sun ♪

18:19.474 --> 18:21.727
♪ Let me go on ♪

18:21.810 --> 18:25.230
♪ Big hands, I know you're the one ♪

18:26.649 --> 18:28.901
All right, the balloon trick.
Can I borrow a phone?

18:29.943 --> 18:33.697
Okay, so, balloon, ordinary balloon,
and ordinary phone.

18:36.867 --> 18:38.827
--Check it out.

18:38.911 --> 18:41.038
- It's how I practice safe text.

18:41.121 --> 18:43.749
All right, I'll do a card trick now,
if you guys wanna see a card trick.

18:43.832 --> 18:45.208
Do you mind picking a card?

18:45.292 --> 18:46.501
-Sure.
-Take one.

18:46.584 --> 18:47.670
Okay.

18:48.629 --> 18:49.713
-Look at it.
-Okay.

18:49.797 --> 18:52.090
Place it back in the deck anywhere.
Good spot.

18:52.174 --> 18:54.968
Okay. So, this trick doesn't use
sleight of hand like most magicians here.

18:55.052 --> 18:56.970
This trick uses sleight of mouth.

18:57.930 --> 19:00.265
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

19:01.850 --> 19:07.397
A-ha! One card folded in my esophagus,
once, twice, three times.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.191
Was that your card?

19:10.442 --> 19:12.360
Uh...

19:12.444 --> 19:15.072
I don't know.
Was I supposed to memorize it?

19:15.155 --> 19:16.865
Yeah.

19:16.949 --> 19:18.075
It was the nine of clubs!

19:18.158 --> 19:20.327
That was her card, guys.
The nine of clubs.

19:21.704 --> 19:23.997
Trust me, it was the nine of clubs.

19:25.498 --> 19:28.168
He just said to look at it.

19:28.919 --> 19:32.380
Oh, yeah, in magic,
"look" means "memorize."

19:32.464 --> 19:34.758
It's rare that you would look
and not memorize.

19:34.842 --> 19:37.594
Oh, well, he didn't explain the rules.

19:37.678 --> 19:43.433
No, I know, I know, but, I mean, you've...
you've seen magic before, right?

19:43.516 --> 19:44.768
I don't know.
I saw that show on Fox

19:44.852 --> 19:46.812
where they explained
how they did the tricks.

19:46.895 --> 19:48.981
Yeah, well, it's okay
if you're not into it.

19:49.064 --> 19:52.317
No! No! I'm having a great time.
This is awesome.

19:52.400 --> 19:53.944
I swear to you, the next time...

19:54.027 --> 19:55.946
I will fuckin' memorize
that card.

19:56.029 --> 19:58.365
Yeah, okay, whatever.
I don't care.

19:58.448 --> 20:00.658
I mean, it's between...
you and your magician.

20:02.410 --> 20:04.412
-All right. Here we go.
-All right.

20:04.496 --> 20:05.538
Sorry about that.

20:14.965 --> 20:17.843
-Chilly beans in here.
-Yeah, it's kinda cold, huh?

20:17.926 --> 20:20.470
Can I borrow your jacket?

20:20.553 --> 20:25.142
Uh, I don't mean to sound like super-crazy
or annoying or anything,

20:25.225 --> 20:28.771
but it's just, like, they're really strict
here about the dress code, so...

20:30.272 --> 20:33.859
Well, maybe since we fucked earlier,
you know...

20:33.942 --> 20:36.361
it wouldn't be that big of a deal.

20:36.444 --> 20:38.321
Okay. Makes sense.

20:38.405 --> 20:41.199
-Yeah
-Okay. But just, um... Just, um...

20:42.034 --> 20:46.413
Ladies and gentlemen,
William the Wonder!

20:56.965 --> 20:58.091
Whoo!

21:02.679 --> 21:04.932
--Wow!

21:05.015 --> 21:06.391
Isn't that amazing?

21:06.474 --> 21:09.770
Yeah, but I just feel like
there's a trick to it.

21:09.853 --> 21:12.981
Well, yeah...
That's what magic is, you know.

21:13.065 --> 21:15.150
-Mmm.
-Tricks.

21:25.535 --> 21:27.037
Whoo!

21:35.838 --> 21:39.967
Yeah, this guy's a real
clothes horse, huh? What?

21:42.427 --> 21:44.471
Why are all the women just assistants?

21:44.554 --> 21:47.557
Like, why aren't there
any female magicians at this place?

21:47.640 --> 21:49.309
Everyone we've seen is a dude.

21:52.354 --> 21:55.607
So, the man reads the paper
while the woman does all the work?

21:55.690 --> 21:57.609
How much longer is this gonna be?

21:57.692 --> 21:59.694
About 40, 45 minutes.

22:06.326 --> 22:09.579
That shit's all wires.
It's always wires.

22:10.580 --> 22:13.500
- Wires and magnets.

22:14.792 --> 22:18.005
-I feel like half of it is like...
-Right.

22:18.088 --> 22:19.882
-It's showmanship.
-Yeah.

22:21.008 --> 22:22.550
I still don't know
how he's doing this shit,

22:22.634 --> 22:25.012
but I know I'm not looking
in the right places.

22:29.516 --> 22:30.600
Oh!

22:37.315 --> 22:39.526
You're gonna need to put
your coat back on.

22:39.609 --> 22:41.278
Gus, your buddy's talking to you.

22:41.361 --> 22:43.155
Oh, hey, what's up?

22:43.238 --> 22:45.115
I'm sorry, but if you don't put
your jacket back on,

22:45.198 --> 22:47.075
- I'm gonna need to ask you to leave.

22:47.159 --> 22:50.495
I'm sorry,
she's just really cold and--

22:50.578 --> 22:52.330
You know the rules? Come on.

22:52.414 --> 22:55.542
What happened to "Welcome home"?
Fuck this shit.

22:55.625 --> 22:59.379
Oh! Um, sorry, Don.
The thing is, she's freezing.

22:59.462 --> 23:01.714
-Don't make me get Carlos.
-Carlos?

23:01.798 --> 23:05.677
Dude, don't be a fucking asshole.
I'm cold. Fuck this.

23:06.844 --> 23:08.096
What...

23:10.682 --> 23:13.351
Ma'am, we believe you've had
enough entertainment for the evening.

23:13.435 --> 23:14.852
What?

23:14.937 --> 23:16.521
- That's enough lip.

23:16.604 --> 23:18.815
Come with me
so I can escort you out of the Castle.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.317
Gus, are you hearing this shit?

23:20.400 --> 23:23.778
-On your feet.
-Um! Get your hands off of me.

23:26.489 --> 23:27.907
Sorry. I'm sorry.

23:35.832 --> 23:38.418
Gus, I'm sorry,
but this place is being a total dick.

23:38.501 --> 23:41.254
- So embarrassing.
- Whatever! Fuck these guys.

23:41.338 --> 23:44.007
Don't say that! Don and Carlos
are just doing their jobs, okay?

23:44.091 --> 23:45.925
Yeah, I guess,
if their job is being a jerk.

23:46.009 --> 23:47.802
Look, they're right.
I should've known better.

23:47.885 --> 23:50.763
-Gus, it's a fucking Magic Castle.
-But it's my fault.

23:50.847 --> 23:52.057
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

23:52.140 --> 23:55.018
Mickey, I'm sorry I'm not some rebel
who's all about "breaking all the rules"

23:55.102 --> 23:56.644
all the time. Okay?

24:01.274 --> 24:04.069
Can I just say, I thought magic
was all about breaking rules.

24:04.152 --> 24:06.821
Like, defying the laws of nature,
whatnot.

24:06.904 --> 24:09.407
And those people...

24:10.408 --> 24:12.619
Oh, my God,
they had such sticks up their asses.

24:12.702 --> 24:14.496
I just don't take it that seriously.

24:15.413 --> 24:18.583
Okay, well, I don't take it
that seriously either, you know.

24:19.459 --> 24:22.587
Like, the reason I like it is because
it doesn't take itself seriously.

24:22.670 --> 24:24.881
For me, I can just like...

24:24.964 --> 24:26.883
turn my brain off for a few hours

24:26.966 --> 24:30.178
and, like, watch it
like I was a kid, or...

24:30.262 --> 24:31.888
You know?

24:31.971 --> 24:37.269
Like, I like seeing a guy pull a necktie
out of a magazine, okay?

24:38.895 --> 24:41.064
That sounded lame as I was saying it,

24:41.148 --> 24:42.690
but, like, in the moment,
I thought it was cool.

24:42.774 --> 24:44.526
It's also not fair
to take someone someplace

24:44.609 --> 24:47.654
and then demand that they have
a specific reaction to it.

24:48.738 --> 24:50.657
Okay. I get that.

24:50.740 --> 24:54.244
I guess I was just, like, excited
and I wanted you to enjoy it, too. And--

24:54.327 --> 24:55.370
-No, I liked things about it.
-Okay.

24:55.453 --> 24:56.871
I just didn't like the things about it
that you like

24:56.954 --> 24:57.997
and that made you mad.

24:58.081 --> 25:00.125
Like, I thought that lady in the lobby
was amazing

25:00.208 --> 25:02.544
and I would've happily
watched her all night.

25:03.878 --> 25:04.879
Okay.

25:05.922 --> 25:07.965
We had fun singing that song
with the piano, right?

25:08.050 --> 25:09.884
Yeah. Yeah, no, it was fun.

25:09.967 --> 25:12.137
It was just--
I think it was just like, you know,

25:12.220 --> 25:16.308
magicians are, like, sticklers
for, like, rules and tradition and stuff.

25:16.391 --> 25:19.144
Yeah, like they all have to
traditionally be men

25:19.227 --> 25:22.272
and the women have to
traditionally wear super tight dresses.

25:22.355 --> 25:25.650
Okay. I'll admit, there is a problem
with sexism in the magic community.

25:25.733 --> 25:30.447
I'm just not good with arbitrary rules
and people who get off on being dicks.

25:35.577 --> 25:39.622
I had a really nice time tonight.
I'm sorry I don't believe in magic.

26:04.356 --> 26:06.899
--Are you mad at me?

26:08.235 --> 26:09.236
No.

26:10.528 --> 26:12.197
Do you wanna come in?

26:13.573 --> 26:15.158
Uh, okay.

26:24.751 --> 26:27.170
Wait, wait!
Can you just hold on for one second?

26:27.254 --> 26:28.255
-Ow.
-You okay?

26:28.338 --> 26:29.756
Yeah, I'm just a little sore from earlier.

26:29.839 --> 26:30.840
-Okay.
-Okay.

26:30.923 --> 26:31.924
-You wanna stop?
-No.

26:32.008 --> 26:33.635
Can we just...
Can we move to the bed?

26:33.718 --> 26:35.762
-Yeah? Yeah, okay, okay.
-Uh, sure. Let's go to the bed.

26:35.845 --> 26:37.222
-Okay.
-Okay.

26:47.774 --> 26:51.611
Would you mind if I use my vibrator?

26:51.694 --> 26:54.281
Oh. No, that, that's cool.

26:54.364 --> 26:56.616
- Yeah, yeah, go ahead.
- Okay.

27:17.929 --> 27:19.764
-Hey. Hey.
-Hi.

27:36.448 --> 27:37.490
- This okay?
- Yes.
