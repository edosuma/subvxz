IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:02.836 --> 00:06.140
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:06.174 --> 00:08.542
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:08.576 --> 00:10.344
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:10.378 --> 00:12.046
ARE MEMBERS
OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:12.080 --> 00:13.614
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:13.647 --> 00:16.417
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:24.158 --> 00:25.326
- HEY!

00:25.359 --> 00:26.794
- SEE? AAH!

00:26.827 --> 00:29.263
- SORRY!
- GET BACK HERE!

00:31.199 --> 00:33.167
- WATCH IT!

00:43.511 --> 00:45.146
- HEY, WATCH IT!

00:45.179 --> 00:46.147
[horn blares]

00:46.180 --> 00:47.181
[tires squeal]

00:53.754 --> 00:56.424
- FRACTURES OF
THE ZYGOMATIC SOCKET,

00:56.457 --> 00:59.493
SCAPULA, RADIUS, AND ULNA.

00:59.527 --> 01:00.694
- WELL, IT MAKES SENSE.

01:00.728 --> 01:02.463
WE'VE GOT WITNESSES
WHO SAW OUR JANE DOE

01:02.496 --> 01:04.598
GET HIT BY A CAB, RUNNING
OUT OF THE FARMERS' MARKET.

01:04.632 --> 01:07.135
- SO WHY'D YOU CALL US IN
FOR A TRAFFIC FATALITY?

01:07.168 --> 01:09.770
- BECAUSE I KNOW
HOW TO DO MY JOB.

01:09.803 --> 01:13.141
I WAS SHOT IN THE LUNG,
NOT IN THE HEAD.

01:13.174 --> 01:16.577
SHE HAS LIGATURE AND FRICTION
MARKS ON HER WRISTS AND ANKLES.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.412
- SHE WAS ABUSED.

01:18.446 --> 01:20.781
- WHEN SHE WASN'T
BEING STARVED TO DEATH.

01:20.814 --> 01:23.784
EYES ARE SUNKEN, SKIN TENTS
WHEN IT SHOULD RETRACT.

01:23.817 --> 01:26.120
HEART IS SOFT AND FLOPPY.

01:26.154 --> 01:28.489
TRACE AMOUNTS OF LUMEN
IN HER STOMACH.

01:28.522 --> 01:30.658
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
IN HER SMALL INTESTINE,

01:30.691 --> 01:34.628
AND HER LIVER IS YELLOW AND
GREASY, CAUSING RHABDOMYOLYSIS.

01:34.662 --> 01:36.764
HER BODY WAS BREAKING DOWN
MUSCLE FOR FUEL.

01:36.797 --> 01:39.267
- HOW'D SHE MANAGE TO RUN?

01:39.300 --> 01:40.801
- ADRENALINE.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.236
- WE HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW OLD SHE IS?

01:42.270 --> 01:45.239
- ADVANCED MALNUTRITION
SKEWS AGE MARKERS,

01:45.273 --> 01:47.875
BUT IF I HAD TO GUESS,
BETWEEN 12 AND 15.

01:47.908 --> 01:51.445
OLD ENOUGH TO HAVE GIVEN BIRTH
WITHIN THE LAST YEAR.

01:51.479 --> 01:54.148
- SHE HAD A BABY?
HOW CAN YOU TELL?

01:54.182 --> 01:55.048
- PELVIC CRADLE SPREADS

01:55.082 --> 01:57.151
WHEN A BABY
BREACHES THE BIRTH CANAL.

01:57.185 --> 02:01.422
- MELINDA, ARE YOU SAYING
THAT CAR DIDN'T KILL THE GIRL?

02:01.455 --> 02:02.256
- DEATH WAS INEVITABLE.

02:02.290 --> 02:04.592
THE TAXI JUST
RUSHED THE PROCESS.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.694
C.O.D. IS
ENFORCED STARVATION.

02:06.727 --> 02:09.730
I'M RULING IT A HOMICIDE.

02:13.267 --> 02:16.237
[Law & Order theme]

02:16.270 --> 02:24.212
*

03:01.349 --> 03:03.617
- IS OUR HOUSE
FALLING APART?

03:03.651 --> 03:07.455
- OLD PIPES. CITY WON'T
SPRING FOR NEW ONES.

03:07.488 --> 03:09.523
- FIX ONE LEAK, TWO MORE CROP UP
AND WE'RE STUCK IN THE MESS.

03:09.557 --> 03:10.624
- JUST LIKE THE ONE YOU MADE

03:10.658 --> 03:11.892
WHEN YOU QUESTIONED
WARNER'S RULING.

03:11.925 --> 03:13.561
- SHE CALLED YOU?

03:13.594 --> 03:15.996
- YOU WANT TO TELL ME WHY
YOU'RE CHALLENGING THE M.E.?

03:16.029 --> 03:17.998
- SURE. CAN'T MAKE
A MURDER CHARGE STICK

03:18.031 --> 03:20.634
BECAUSE THE ABUSE DIDN'T
ACTUALLY KILL JANE DOE.

03:20.668 --> 03:21.602
THE CAB DID.

03:21.635 --> 03:23.737
- THE BEST WE COULD DO
IS ATTEMPTED MURDER.

03:23.771 --> 03:25.939
- FIN'S GOT SURVEILLANCE
FOOTAGE OF THE GIRL

03:25.973 --> 03:27.174
UP ON THE FLAT SCREEN.

03:27.207 --> 03:30.278
NOW, I SUGGEST YOU FIND THE
BASTARD WHO STARVED HER FIRST

03:30.311 --> 03:35.549
AND LET THE D.A. WORRY
ABOUT WHAT CHARGES TO FILE.

03:35.583 --> 03:38.286
- WHATEVER OUR JANE DOE
IS RUNNING FROM,

03:38.319 --> 03:39.620
SHE LOOKS TERRIFIED.

03:39.653 --> 03:41.589
- SO DOES THE KID
RUNNING BEHIND HER.

03:41.622 --> 03:42.656
- IS HE CHASING HER?

03:42.690 --> 03:44.592
- IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE BOTH
TRYING TO GET AWAY.

03:44.625 --> 03:45.759
- WHERE DID THIS START?

03:45.793 --> 03:47.628
- DOWNTOWN
AT FARMERS' MARKET.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.463
THEY GOT LOST IN THE CROWD
AT THE INTERSECTION.

03:49.497 --> 03:52.333
- CAN YOU ZOOM IN ON THE STALL
SHE CRASHED INTO?

03:52.366 --> 03:54.001
- NUMBER 50.

03:54.034 --> 03:55.436
- SHE CAME OUT OF NOWHERE.

03:55.469 --> 03:57.705
BROKE A DOZEN JARS
OF BLUEBERRY COMPOTE.

03:57.738 --> 03:58.906
- LET IT GO ALREADY.

03:58.939 --> 04:01.008
- SHE RUINED
OUR DISPLAY, BOB.

04:01.041 --> 04:02.676
I SPENT A LOT OF TIME
PICKING THAT FRUIT.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.278
- LOOK, WE DON'T
WANT TO PRESS ANY CHARGES

04:04.312 --> 04:05.546
OR GET THE GIRL IN TROUBLE.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.648
- SPEAK FOR YOURSELF.
THOSE KIDS ARE A MENACE.

04:07.681 --> 04:08.782
- "THOSE KIDS"?

04:08.816 --> 04:10.718
- YEAH, SHE'S
A MISSION FARMS HIRE.

04:10.751 --> 04:11.919
- DID YOU SEE
ANOTHER KID WITH HER?

04:11.952 --> 04:14.655
- DIDN'T REALLY NOTICE AFTER
SHE DESTROYED MY MASON JARS,

04:14.688 --> 04:16.457
BUT THERE'S USUALLY
A LOT OF THEM.

04:16.490 --> 04:19.427
- MISSION FARMS GIVES
AT-RISK KIDS DAY JOBS.

04:19.460 --> 04:20.661
CARLY WAS A GOOD GIRL.

04:20.694 --> 04:21.795
- YOU KNOW HER LAST NAME?

04:21.829 --> 04:23.697
- NO, BUT MY HUSBAND'S
A PUSHOVER,

04:23.731 --> 04:25.566
ALWAYS GIVING
AWAY FREE SAMPLES.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.067
THAT GIRL
SCARFED UP MY FOOD,

04:27.100 --> 04:29.837
AND THEN HAD THE NERVE
TO PUKE IT ALL UP.

04:29.870 --> 04:32.340
- YOU SAID THAT
MISSION FARMS HIRED CARLY.

04:32.373 --> 04:33.407
WHERE'S THEIR STALL?

04:33.441 --> 04:34.575
- THEY'RE ONLY HERE
ON WEEKENDS

04:34.608 --> 04:35.743
AND THE OCCASIONAL WEEKDAY.

04:35.776 --> 04:36.810
- ANY IDEA WHERE
THEIR FARM IS LOCATED?

04:36.844 --> 04:39.847
- SORRY.
SPEAK TO MANAGEMENT.

04:42.983 --> 04:46.520
- ACTUAL FARM'S ON LONG ISLAND,
SUFFOLK COUNTY.

04:46.554 --> 04:49.523
MISSION FARMS RENTED A STALL
SIX MONTHS AGO.

04:49.557 --> 04:53.961
THEY'RE SET UP THREE DAYS PER
WEEK MAX AND PAID IN ADVANCE.

04:53.994 --> 04:56.364
- THERE A REASON THEY HIRE ONLY
MINORS TO WORK THEIR STALLS?

04:56.397 --> 04:58.366
- YOU'LL HAVE TO ASK THEM.

04:58.399 --> 05:00.100
- BUT IT DOESN'T BOTHER YOU,
AS LONG AS THE CHECKS CLEAR.

05:00.133 --> 05:03.671
- LOOK, U.S. LABOR CODE
ALLOWS 12 AND 13-YEAR-OLD KIDS

05:03.704 --> 05:05.506
TO WORK FARMS
WITH PARENTAL CONSENT.

05:05.539 --> 05:06.774
14 AND UP
CAN WORK WITHOUT IT.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.776
- AND THEY'RE PAID
LESS THAN MINIMUM WAGE,

05:08.809 --> 05:10.711
CHARGED FOR RIDES
TO THE FARM,

05:10.744 --> 05:12.045
FOOD, EVEN FOR
THEIR DRINKING WATER.

05:12.079 --> 05:13.614
PRETTY SOON, THEY'RE
IN DEBT TO THE FARMERS.

05:13.647 --> 05:16.384
- YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
ILLEGALS.

05:16.417 --> 05:19.086
MISSION FARMS HIRES
AT-RISK AMERICAN KIDS.

05:19.119 --> 05:20.253
- WHO'RE JUST
AS VULNERABLE.

05:20.287 --> 05:23.557
- LOOK, EVERY MINOR WORKING
A STALL IN FARMERS' MARKET

05:23.591 --> 05:24.558
HAS TO HAVE A PERMIT.

05:24.592 --> 05:27.395
- OKAY, YOU GOT A W-2
ON A GIRL NAMED CARLY?

05:27.428 --> 05:33.100
- CARLY.
[exhales]

05:33.133 --> 05:35.102
UH, HOLBART, 15,
LOWER EAST SIDE ADDRESS.

05:35.135 --> 05:37.638
I'LL WRITE IT DOWN FOR YOU.

05:37.671 --> 05:40.674
[knocking]

05:45.546 --> 05:47.848
- POLICE.
OPEN UP.

05:50.484 --> 05:51.552
- YEAH?

05:51.585 --> 05:52.686
- SORRY TO
BOTHER YOU, MA'AM.

05:52.720 --> 05:53.854
I'M LOOKING
FOR YOUR NEIGHBORS

05:53.887 --> 05:55.689
BY THE NAME OF HOLBART.

05:55.723 --> 05:58.659
- GOT EVICTED ABOUT A YEAR AGO,
AFTER THE MOTHER DIED.

05:58.692 --> 05:59.993
CANCER.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.695
- YOU KNOW WHERE THEY WENT?

06:01.729 --> 06:02.896
- AWAY.

06:02.930 --> 06:04.598
[door slams and locks]

06:05.766 --> 06:06.900
- YOU FIND THE FAMILY?

06:06.934 --> 06:09.169
- YEP, PATRICK HOLBART
AND HIS FOUR KIDS,

06:09.202 --> 06:11.038
TOSSED OUT ON THE STREET
A YEAR AGO,

06:11.071 --> 06:15.042
DROWNING IN HOSPITAL DEBT AFTER
CARLY'S MOTHER DIED OF CANCER.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.744
NO CURRENT JOB,
NO ADDRESS.

06:16.777 --> 06:19.880
- AND NO RECORDS OF A MISSING
PERSON REPORT FILED ON CARLY.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.882
- YOU THINK DAD
STARVED HIS KID?

06:21.915 --> 06:24.785
- A LOT OF MOUTHS TO FEED,
NO INCOME.

06:24.818 --> 06:25.553
- DID HE HAVE A SHEET?

06:25.586 --> 06:27.721
ANY DV CALLS
TO THE RESIDENCE?

06:27.755 --> 06:29.923
- NO, BUT THE ABUSE COULD'VE
STARTED AFTER THE EVICTION.

06:29.957 --> 06:31.892
- HOLBART
WORKED CONSTRUCTION.

06:31.925 --> 06:33.494
- YEAH, I TALKED
TO HIS UNION REP.

06:33.527 --> 06:35.429
HE HASN'T PAID
HIS LOCAL DUES IN A WHILE,

06:35.463 --> 06:37.030
AND HE WON'T GET ANY WORK
TILL HE DOES.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.600
- WAS HE GETTING UNEMPLOYMENT,
SOCIAL SECURITY?

06:39.633 --> 06:41.201
- BENEFITS STOPPED
A LONG TIME AGO.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.936
- THERE'S GOT TO BE A WAY
TO TRACE THIS GUY.

06:42.970 --> 06:47.508
- WELL, REGISTRATION IS CURRENT
ON AN OLD STATION WAGON.

06:47.541 --> 06:48.341
WE PUT OUT A BOLO.
[phone ringing]

06:48.375 --> 06:49.777
- WHAT ABOUT
THE OTHER THREE KIDS?

06:49.810 --> 06:53.046
- I GOT THAT RIGHT HERE.
SON MICAH, 13.

06:53.080 --> 06:56.116
TWO OTHER DAUGHTERS, SAVANNAH,
SEVEN; LIZZIE, FIVE.

06:56.149 --> 06:57.217
- AND WHERE ARE THEY?

06:57.250 --> 06:58.986
- CHILD SERVICES
TOOK CUSTODY A YEAR AGO

06:59.019 --> 06:59.820
FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS.

06:59.853 --> 07:01.622
HOLBART INVOKED
HIS PARENTAL RIGHTS,

07:01.655 --> 07:03.757
PICKED THEM UP,
DISAPPEARED.

07:03.791 --> 07:05.058
- PATROL JUST LOCATED
HOLBART'S CAR

07:05.092 --> 07:07.728
IN AN ALLEY
BEHIND ST. SEBASTIAN'S.

07:17.237 --> 07:21.775
- MISS, DO YOU KNOW WHERE
I CAN FIND THEM?

07:24.645 --> 07:26.547
- HEY, EL, THIS IS BAD.

07:26.580 --> 07:27.948
WE CAN'T TELL HOLBART
THAT HIS DAUGHTER'S DEAD.

07:27.981 --> 07:30.083
NOT HERE.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.952
- IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHERE HE HEARS IT.

07:31.985 --> 07:35.122
EXCUSE ME.
MR. HOBART? POLICE.

07:35.155 --> 07:37.558
- YEAH, I KNOW I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO BLOCK THE ALLEY.

07:37.591 --> 07:39.693
I'M LEAVING RIGHT NOW.
HERE, RINSE.

07:39.727 --> 07:42.630
- MR. HOBART,
YOU NEED TO COME WITH US.

07:42.663 --> 07:46.767
- ALL RIGHT, PLEASE
DON'T TAKE MY KIDS.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.736
- IT'S ABOUT
YOUR DAUGHTER, CARLY.

07:48.769 --> 07:53.774
- YOU'VE SEEN HER?
WHERE--WHERE--IS SHE OKAY?

07:53.807 --> 07:55.776
- WE SHOULD
DISCUSS THIS IN PRIVATE.

07:55.809 --> 07:59.980
- NO. NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO.

08:00.013 --> 08:01.114
THAT'S--THAT'S
THAT'S NOT--

08:01.148 --> 08:02.716
- DADDY, WHAT'S WRONG?

08:02.750 --> 08:04.752
- NOTHING, SWEETIE.
NOTHING. EVERYTHING'S--

08:04.785 --> 08:06.987
- PLEASE DON'T LET THEM
TAKE US.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.523
- NO, THEY--
EVERYTHING'S--

08:09.557 --> 08:12.793
EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE FINE.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.596
- YOUR DAUGHTER
WAS HIT BY A CAR.

08:15.629 --> 08:18.666
- SHE WENT QUICKLY.

08:18.699 --> 08:21.001
- YEAH, WELL,
IT'S MY FAULT.

08:21.034 --> 08:24.304
IT'S MY JOB TO LOOK AFTER THEM,
AND I--I--

08:24.337 --> 08:26.707
I COULDN'T EVEN
MANAGE THAT, SO...

08:26.740 --> 08:29.009
- MR. HOLBART, WHEN WAS THE LAST
TIME YOU SAW YOUR DAUGHTER?

08:29.042 --> 08:30.878
- ABOUT A YEAR AGO.

08:30.911 --> 08:32.012
- SHE RAN AWAY?

08:32.045 --> 08:33.781
- NO.

08:33.814 --> 08:35.716
HER AND MICAH
WERE WORKING FARMLAND.

08:35.749 --> 08:38.786
- CARLY AND MICAH, DID THEY WORK
AT MISSION FARMS?

08:38.819 --> 08:43.323
- ALL I KNOW IS, IT'S SOMEPLACE
OUT ON LONG ISLAND.

08:43.356 --> 08:48.796
WHEN THEIR MOTHER DIED,
I, UH...

08:48.829 --> 08:51.699
I--I--
I COULDN'T PAY THE BILLS.

08:51.732 --> 08:53.734
I COULD BARELY KEEP FOOD
ON THE TABLE.

08:53.767 --> 08:56.804
YOU KNOW, NOT ENOUGH FOR THEM
TO EAT REGULAR, ANYWAY.

08:56.837 --> 08:58.572
- YOU SENT YOUR KIDS AWAY
TO MAKE MONEY.

08:58.606 --> 09:01.675
- I HAD TO.
I HAD NO CHOICE.

09:01.709 --> 09:03.677
I WAS TOLD THEY COULD WORK
OUT OF TOWN

09:03.711 --> 09:05.245
SINCE THEY WERE TOO YOUNG
TO WORK IN THE CITY.

09:05.278 --> 09:06.446
- WHO TOLD YOU THAT?
- THE LADY.

09:06.479 --> 09:09.282
THE, UH, THE, UH, LATINO WOMAN
WHO CAME TO PICK THEM UP.

09:09.316 --> 09:11.785
- OH, OKAY. OKAY.

09:11.819 --> 09:15.789
SO YOU TURNED DEFENSELESS MINORS
OVER TO A STRANGER.

09:15.823 --> 09:18.358
- A WOMAN WOULD NOT HURT THEM,
RIGHT?

09:18.391 --> 09:20.027
AND SHE GAVE ME
A PHONE NUMBER,

09:20.060 --> 09:21.829
AND I TALKED TO THEM A COUPLE
TIMES AFTER THEY LEFT.

09:21.862 --> 09:23.731
- BUT THEN YOU JUST, WHAT?
KIND OF LOST TOUCH WITH THEM?

09:23.764 --> 09:25.999
- NO, THE NUMBER
GOT DISCONNECTED.

09:26.033 --> 09:29.202
- WHAT IS THIS WOMAN'S NAME?
- MAGDA PALOMA.

09:29.236 --> 09:33.240
SHE WAS, UM,
LIKE, 35, SHORT.

09:33.273 --> 09:36.376
SHE HAD A LITTLE SCAR
OVER HER LEFT EYE,

09:36.409 --> 09:38.278
AND I EVEN GOT THE LICENSE PLATE
RIGHT HERE.

09:38.311 --> 09:40.080
- LET ME GUESS.

09:40.113 --> 09:42.783
SHE GAVE YOU AN ADVANCE
FOR THEIR SALARIES?

09:42.816 --> 09:44.384
- 500 BUCKS.
- YEAH.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.086
- SAID CARLY AND MICAH
COULD WORK IT OFF.

09:46.119 --> 09:47.721
- YOU SOLD YOUR KIDS
TO A PREDATOR.

09:47.755 --> 09:52.760
- I LOVE MY KIDS.
I GOT THEM WORK.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.327
LOTS OF KIDS HAVE JOBS.

09:54.361 --> 09:56.096
- MR. HOLBART,
YOU HAD OTHER OPTIONS.

09:56.129 --> 09:58.932
- I BEGGED CHILD SERVICES
TO HELP.

09:58.966 --> 10:02.069
THEY DRAGGED MY KIDS AWAY,
CRYING AND SCREAMING,

10:02.102 --> 10:03.704
AND SPLIT THEM UP.

10:03.737 --> 10:05.272
AND LIZZIE GOT
HER ARM BROKEN

10:05.305 --> 10:08.408
'CAUSE SOME OTHER KID
OVER THERE ATTACKED HER.

10:08.441 --> 10:12.212
THERE'S PREDATORS
IN FOSTER CARE TOO, DETECTIVE.

10:12.245 --> 10:14.314
- WHEN YOU SPOKE
WITH YOUR DAUGHTER,

10:14.347 --> 10:17.751
DID SHE MENTION TO YOU
THAT SHE MIGHT BE PREGNANT?

10:17.785 --> 10:23.757
- NO, SHE'S--
SHE'S TOO YOUNG!

10:23.791 --> 10:27.327
WHY?

10:27.360 --> 10:31.832
DID SHE GET ABU--ABUSED
OR SOMETHING?

10:31.865 --> 10:33.801
- YOUR DAUGHTER WAS STARVED,

10:33.834 --> 10:37.037
BEATEN,
AND SEXUALLY ASSAULTED.

10:50.417 --> 10:53.420
- I SENT--

10:53.453 --> 10:56.724
I SENT THEM AWAY
SO THEY COULD HAVE FOOD

10:56.757 --> 10:59.827
AND SHELTER,

10:59.860 --> 11:03.797
SO THEY WOULD BE SAFE.

11:03.831 --> 11:06.266
- DOES THAT
LOOK SAFE TO YOU?

11:12.873 --> 11:16.309
- [crying]

11:26.519 --> 11:29.189
- YOU HAVE MICAH?
WHERE IS HE?

11:29.222 --> 11:30.490
- THAT'S YOUR SON?

11:30.523 --> 11:31.892
- THEY'RE 14 MONTHS APART.

11:31.925 --> 11:33.393
THEY ALWAYS LOOKED
AFTER EACH OTHER.

11:33.426 --> 11:36.496
THERE'S NO WAY HE WOULD LEAVE
HER BLEEDING IN THE STREET.

11:36.529 --> 11:40.033
HE MUST BE IN TROUBLE
LIKE--LIKE SHE WAS.

11:40.067 --> 11:44.371
I MEAN--
YOU GOTTA HELP ME FIND HIM.

11:44.404 --> 11:47.440
YOU GOTTA HELP ME,
PLEASE.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.076
HE'S MY BOY!

11:57.084 --> 11:58.819
- MISSION FARMS IS BOGUS.

11:58.852 --> 12:00.220
THERE'S NOT A LISTING
IN SUFFOLK COUNTY

12:00.253 --> 12:02.122
OR ANYWHERE
IN UPSTATE NEW YORK.

12:02.155 --> 12:03.924
- DID FIN RUN THE LICENSE PLATE
HOLBART GAVE US

12:03.957 --> 12:05.125
ON THE LATINA WOMAN'S CAR?

12:05.158 --> 12:07.995
- A VEHICLE WAS REPORTED
AS STOLEN A YEAR AGO

12:08.028 --> 12:08.996
AND NEVER RECOVERED.

12:09.029 --> 12:10.497
- HOW ABOUT THE CELL?

12:10.530 --> 12:13.867
- DISPOSABLE FROM A BATCH BOUGHT
IN A SPANISH HARLEM BODEGA.

12:13.901 --> 12:14.868
- LIV.

12:14.902 --> 12:18.038
- I'LL BE BACK, SWEETIE.
JUST GIVE ME A MINUTE.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.907
- MAGDA PALOMA IS A GHOST.

12:19.940 --> 12:22.475
- JUST ANOTHER WELL-ORGANIZED
PREDATOR LYING IN WAIT.

12:22.509 --> 12:24.878
- DAD'S NOT MUCH BETTER,
TRAFFICKING HIS OWN KIDS.

12:24.912 --> 12:28.215
- WELL, THE ONLY THING HE'S
GUILTY OF IS POOR JUDGMENT.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.917
A LOT OF KIDS GET JOBS,
ELLIOT.

12:29.950 --> 12:33.420
- WELL, WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO A CHILDHOOD?

12:33.453 --> 12:35.555
- THE WORK WAS LEGAL.
CUT HIM LOOSE.

12:35.588 --> 12:36.389
- SHOULD I CALL CHILD SERVICES

12:36.423 --> 12:37.490
TO HAVE THEM
PICK UP THE DAUGHTERS?

12:37.524 --> 12:39.927
- THEY'RE NOT ABUSED,
THEY'RE CLEAN AND WELL-FED.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.361
- AND HOMELESS.

12:41.394 --> 12:43.196
- WHICH ISN'T A CRIMINAL ACT.

12:43.230 --> 12:45.866
AND I'M NOT SEPARATING THIS
FAMILY FOR ANYTHING LESS.

12:45.899 --> 12:47.868
- GOT SOMETHING
YOU NEED TO SEE.

12:47.901 --> 12:50.537
A CIVILIAN CAUGHT OUR VICTIM'S
FOOT CHASE ON A CELL PHONE.

12:50.570 --> 12:53.306
IT'S NOT WHAT WE THINK.

12:53.340 --> 12:58.979
WATCH THE LEFT-HAND CORNER.

12:59.012 --> 13:00.981
- MICAH PUSHED CARLY
INTO TRAFFIC?

13:01.014 --> 13:04.151
- WHY WOULD HE TRY TO STOP
HIS SISTER FROM ESCAPING?

13:04.184 --> 13:07.054
- FEAR. LOOK AT HIM. HE'S JUST
AS STARVED AS CARLY IS.

13:07.087 --> 13:10.023
- AND SEXUALLY ASSAULTED
AND SODOMIZED.

13:10.057 --> 13:12.993
CHARGED WITH PROSTITUTION
AND RESISTING.

13:13.026 --> 13:14.194
- FIRST THEY WORK THE FARM,

13:14.227 --> 13:15.863
THEN THEY'RE FORCED
INTO THE SEX TRADE.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.965
- THERE'S MORE MONEY
IN FLESH THAN PRODUCE.

13:17.998 --> 13:20.167
- AND PRIVATE ADOPTION.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.869
WARNER SAID THAT
CARLY HAD A BABY.

13:21.902 --> 13:23.837
HOW MUCH WOULD AN INFANT GO FOR
ON THE BLACK MARKET?

13:23.871 --> 13:25.338
- THOUSANDS.

13:25.372 --> 13:27.607
A LOT OF PERVS OUT THERE LOOKING
TO RAISE A VICTIM IN-HOUSE.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.543
- NOW, HOW IS IT
A 13-YEAR-OLD IS ARRESTED

13:30.577 --> 13:32.946
FOR AN ACT HE CAN'T
LEGALLY CONSENT TO?

13:32.980 --> 13:34.414
- THAT'S THE FIRST THING
I'M GONNA ASK THE FOOL

13:34.447 --> 13:36.884
THAT PINCHED HIM.

13:36.917 --> 13:40.587
DETECTIVE CRUZ,
ODAFIN TUTUOLA, SVU.

13:40.620 --> 13:41.889
- WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?

13:41.922 --> 13:45.258
- MICAH HOLBART.

13:45.292 --> 13:47.427
- I'VE SEEN HIM AROUND.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.196
- NO, YOU SCOOPED HIM
FOR PANDERING.

13:49.229 --> 13:50.898
HE'S 13.
THAT MAKES HIM A VICTIM.

13:50.931 --> 13:52.232
- I'LL LET HIM KNOW,
NEXT TIME I COLLAR HIM

13:52.265 --> 13:53.166
FOR WORKING A CORNER.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.635
- THESE KIDS ARE SEXUALLY
ASSAULTED 24/7.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.337
YOU CAN'T TREAT THEM
LIKE CRIMINALS.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.606
- WE MATCH THEIR PHOTOS
TO MISSING PERSONS

13:59.639 --> 14:02.042
AND SEND THEM HOME TO THE SAME
SCREWED-UP FAMILIES

14:02.075 --> 14:03.443
THAT MADE THEM RUN
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

14:03.476 --> 14:04.978
THEY END UP
RIGHT BACK ON THE CORNER

14:05.012 --> 14:06.914
BEFORE I EVEN
FINISH MY SHIFT.

14:06.947 --> 14:09.416
- THE NEW LAWS ARE
SUPPOSED TO PROTECT THEM

14:09.449 --> 14:10.650
FROM BEING CHARGED.

14:10.683 --> 14:14.387
- ONLY IF THEY FLIP ON THEIR
PIMPS AND TESTIFY IN OPEN COURT.

14:14.421 --> 14:16.924
- SO NO ONE'S GONNA TALK
WITHOUT A SAFE PLACE TO GO.

14:16.957 --> 14:17.857
- NOW YOU SEE
WHAT I'M UP AGAINST,

14:17.891 --> 14:20.060
YOU WANT TO CRAWL
OUT OF MY ASS, PLEASE?

14:20.093 --> 14:24.031
- LOOK, I NEED TO
FIND MICAH FAST.

14:24.064 --> 14:25.966
- WHAT DO YOU NEED FROM ME?

14:25.999 --> 14:28.401
- I NEED FACE-TO-FACE TIME
WITH THEIR PIMPS.

14:28.435 --> 14:30.437
LET'S GO.

14:32.139 --> 14:34.341
THIS ALL OF THEM?
- DON'T SWEAT IT.

14:34.374 --> 14:38.045
GUPPIES WILL GET THE WORD
AS SOON AS WE LEAVE.

14:38.078 --> 14:42.082

14:56.129 --> 14:57.697
AND MOST OF ALL,
AIN'T NO MONEY GETTING MADE.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.200
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
MY MAN, MY MAN.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.269
AIN'T NO NEED
TO FLEX SO HARD.

15:02.302 --> 15:04.437
I JUST HAPPEN TO KNOW
A SWEET YOUNG THING

15:04.471 --> 15:06.473
THAT'S FRIENDLY
WITH THE BRAT.

15:06.506 --> 15:08.441
- WHO'RE YOU?

15:08.475 --> 15:10.643
- AN EXPEDITER,

15:10.677 --> 15:13.513
TRYING TO MEET THE NEEDS
OF THIS PARTICULAR MARKET.

BARELY HIT PUBERTY.

15:19.586 --> 15:22.522

NOBODY WANTS AN OLD WHORE.

15:22.555 --> 15:26.093
- WHO RUNS HIM?

15:26.126 --> 15:29.629
- HE'S A DROP-OFF
IN A GROUP STABLE.

15:29.662 --> 15:31.598
WHOEVER RUNS IT
KEEPS THEIR DISTANCE.

15:31.631 --> 15:32.665
- NOTICE
ANY MUSCLE WITH THEM?

15:32.699 --> 15:35.602
- KIDS POLICE THEMSELVES,
KEEP EACH OTHER IN LINE.

15:35.635 --> 15:38.038
WISH I KNEW HOW THEY DID IT.
I'D LOVE SOME TIME-OFF.

15:38.071 --> 15:40.040

15:47.247 --> 15:51.718
YOU DON'T WANT TO
PLAY WITH ME.

15:51.751 --> 15:55.022

I'LL HAVE JASMINE

15:55.055 --> 15:58.191
DELIVER HIM RIGHT TO YOU
AND ONLY YOU.

15:58.225 --> 16:01.228

WHO REHABBED THE PRECINCTS
JUST GOT INDICTED.

16:21.081 --> 16:22.249

16:22.282 --> 16:24.051

16:24.084 --> 16:26.019
WE MAY HAVE TO UNDERPIN
THE FOUNDATION.

16:26.053 --> 16:27.554

19:47.520 --> 19:50.523
CAN I GO NOW?
- NO. WAIT. HEY, HEY.

19:50.557 --> 19:51.858
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
RESTRAIN HIM, ARE YOU?

19:51.891 --> 19:53.560
- HE'S GONNA HURT HIMSELF.
- YOU SAW HIS BACK.

19:53.593 --> 19:54.427
THEY MADE HIM A SLAVE.

19:54.461 --> 19:55.395
ARE YOU GONNA TREAT HIM
LIKE ONE NOW?

19:55.428 --> 19:59.566
- MAYBE IT'S THE ONLY THING
HE'S USED TO.

19:59.599 --> 20:02.702
[thudding]

20:05.405 --> 20:09.409
- ALL RIGHT.
LISTEN TO ME.

20:09.442 --> 20:11.644
I'LL TAKE THESE OFF OF YOU
AS SOON AS YOU CALM DOWN,

20:11.678 --> 20:13.680
I PROMISE.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.986
- HOW'S MICAH?
- SEDATED.

20:20.019 --> 20:21.488
HE'S GOT MULTIPLE
HEALED FRACTURES,

20:21.521 --> 20:23.390
EVIDENCE OF REPEATED
SEXUAL PENETRATION,

20:23.423 --> 20:25.558
AND SEVERE MALNUTRITION.

20:25.592 --> 20:26.659
- HOW SEVERE?

20:26.693 --> 20:28.528
- WELL, FROM
THE HEIGHT/WEIGHT SCALE,

20:28.561 --> 20:31.998
HE SHOULD BE
20 POUNDS HEAVIER.

20:32.031 --> 20:35.668
- HE'S A HUMAN TRAFFICKING
VICTIM.

20:35.702 --> 20:37.970
- EXPLAINS WHY HIS HANDS
ARE CUT-UP AND CALLUSED.

20:38.004 --> 20:40.573
AND HIS BLOOD WORK CAME BACK
WITH DECREASED CHOLINESTERASE.

20:40.607 --> 20:42.041
- FARM PESTICIDES.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.677
- ORGANOPHOSPHATES
OR CARBAMATES.

20:44.711 --> 20:45.678
- CAN YOU TREAT IT?

20:45.712 --> 20:46.779
- WELL, IT DEPENDS
ON THE AMOUNT OF EXPOSURE

20:46.813 --> 20:48.281
AND ABSORPTION RATE.

20:48.315 --> 20:49.982
FARM WORKERS ARE VULNERABLE
TO CHEMICAL DRIFT,

20:50.016 --> 20:52.018
BUT, YOU KNOW,
WE'LL KNOW MORE AFTER TESTING.

20:52.051 --> 20:53.786
- HOW ABOUT
THE SCARS ON HIS BACK?

20:53.820 --> 20:57.990
- AH, A BELT BUCKLE OR,
YOU KNOW, EVEN A BULL WHIP.

20:58.024 --> 20:59.826
DOES MICAH
HAVE ANY FAMILY?

20:59.859 --> 21:01.861
SOMEONE TO SUPPORT HIM THROUGH
TREATMENT AND COUNSELING?

21:01.894 --> 21:03.696
- HIS FATHER
LIVES IN HIS CAR,

21:03.730 --> 21:04.597
AND WE'RE TRYING
TO LOCATE HIM NOW.

21:04.631 --> 21:06.433
- YEAH, WE--WE NEED
TO SPEAK TO MICAH.

21:06.466 --> 21:09.602
- I HOPE YOU HAVE BETTER LUCK
THAN I DID.

21:12.372 --> 21:16.509
- MICAH,
FEEL LIKE TALKING?

21:19.078 --> 21:22.982
- I TOLD YOU TO LET ME GO.
YOU'LL GET THEM KILLED.

21:23.015 --> 21:25.985
- SO WHY DON'T YOU TELL US
WHERE THEY ARE,

21:26.018 --> 21:28.087
AND WE'LL GET THEM OUT.

21:28.120 --> 21:32.659
- LIAR.
EVERYBODY LIES.

21:32.692 --> 21:34.627
NO ONE
DOES SOMETHING FOR NOTHING.

21:34.661 --> 21:35.962
- WELL, I DO.

21:35.995 --> 21:37.664
LOOK, I WANT TO
HELP YOUR FRIENDS,

21:37.697 --> 21:39.699
BUT I CAN'T
DO IT WITHOUT YOU.

21:39.732 --> 21:41.834
- I SUGGEST YOU TRY.

21:41.868 --> 21:44.604
DAN GOLDBERG,
MICAH'S GUARDIAN-AD-LITEM

21:44.637 --> 21:45.405
ASSIGNED BY
THE FAMILY COURT.

21:45.438 --> 21:47.574
YOU CANNOT
INTERROGATE MY CLIENT.

21:47.607 --> 21:50.076
- THIS ISN'T AN INTERROGATION,
IT'S AN INTERVIEW.

21:50.109 --> 21:51.511
- EITHER WAY, GOOD-BYE.

21:51.544 --> 21:53.980
- LET'S TAKE THIS OUTSIDE.

21:55.715 --> 21:59.452
COUNSELOR, THAT BOY,
HE'S BEEN STARVED,

21:59.486 --> 22:00.887
BEATEN, AND FORCED
INTO PROSTITUTION.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.422
- I UNDERSTAND.

22:02.455 --> 22:04.424
I'VE DISCUSSED THIS WHOLE THING
WITH HIS ATTENDING.

22:04.457 --> 22:05.358
- THEN YOU SHOULD KNOW

22:05.392 --> 22:06.759
HOW MUCH WE WANT
THE ANIMALS WHO DID THIS.

22:06.793 --> 22:09.362
- AND TO RESCUE
ANY OTHER KIDS LIKE HIM.

22:09.396 --> 22:10.563
- AS LONG AS HE'S
CONSIDERED A SUSPECT

22:10.597 --> 22:12.365
IN HIS SISTER'S MURDER,
HE'S OFF-LIMITS.

22:12.399 --> 22:13.633
THAT'S IT.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.067
- YOU'RE RISKING THE LIVES
OF OTHER CHILDREN.

22:15.101 --> 22:18.771
- LOOK, I HAVE ONE JOB HERE,
WHICH IS TO PROTECT MICAH.

22:18.805 --> 22:22.442
DON'T YOU GUYS THINK IT'S TIME
THAT SOMEBODY DID?

22:23.576 --> 22:27.447
[car horn honking]

22:27.480 --> 22:28.815
- GIVING THEM
THE HAIRY EYEBALL

22:28.848 --> 22:30.383
ISN'T GONNA MAKE THEM MOVE,
CAPTAIN.

22:30.417 --> 22:31.451
THEY'RE UNION.

22:31.484 --> 22:32.719
- THEY'RE WASTING TIME.

22:32.752 --> 22:34.921
- SO ARE WE IF WE CAN'T GET
MICAH TO TALK.

22:34.954 --> 22:36.889
- DID THE D.A.
DECLINE TO PROSECUTE?

22:36.923 --> 22:38.858
- HE DOESN'T WANT TO CHARGE
AN UNDERAGE ABUSE VICTIM

22:38.891 --> 22:40.627
FOR MURDER AS AN ADULT.

22:40.660 --> 22:43.129
- THE KID'S LOOKING AT JUVENILE
LOCK-UP OR THE PSYCH WARD.

22:43.162 --> 22:44.464
- EITHER WAY, GOLDBERG ISN'T
GOING TO LET HIM

22:44.497 --> 22:45.398
ANYWHERE NEAR US.

22:45.432 --> 22:47.166
- UNLESS WE GIVE HIM
SOMETHING HE NEEDS.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.735
- LIKE?

22:48.768 --> 22:50.837
- A PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION
OF HIS INTENT

22:50.870 --> 22:52.405
WHEN HE CHASED
HIS SISTER DOWN.

22:52.439 --> 22:54.941
- THE JUVENILE COURT'S
AN AUTOMATIC BENCH TRIAL.

22:54.974 --> 22:56.709
THE JUDGE WILL PROBABLY
CUT MICAH LOOSE

22:56.743 --> 22:57.877
IF WE CAN
GET A SHRINK TO SAY

22:57.910 --> 22:59.178
HE DIDN'T MEAN
TO KILL HIS SISTER.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.748
- I'LL CALL DR. HUANG
AND SET IT UP.

23:03.916 --> 23:06.486
- MICAH,
DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH.

23:06.519 --> 23:07.787
YOU'RE GONNA PASS OUT.

23:07.820 --> 23:10.857
- OUT. LET ME OUT.
I WANT OUT.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.058
- I WILL OPEN THE DOOR,

23:12.091 --> 23:13.626
BUT YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO GO OUT.

23:13.660 --> 23:15.962
OKAY?

23:26.706 --> 23:29.008
- I HATE LOCKS AND CHAINS.

23:29.041 --> 23:31.177
IT'S DARK AND MUSTY,
AND IT SMELLS ROTTEN.

23:31.210 --> 23:34.413
- WERE YOU LOCKED
IN A CELLAR?

23:36.248 --> 23:38.618
- ON THE FARM.

23:38.651 --> 23:42.722
DO SOMETHING WRONG, MAKE A
MISTAKE, WE ALL GET A BEATING.

23:42.755 --> 23:43.923
NO MARKS ON THE GIRLS.

23:43.956 --> 23:45.525
MEN DON'T WANT THEM UGLY.

23:45.558 --> 23:49.428
- TELL ME ABOUT YOUR FIRST DAY
ON THE FARM, HMM?

23:52.632 --> 23:54.667
WHO DROVE YOU THERE?

23:54.701 --> 23:57.103
- MAGDA WAS NICE.

23:57.136 --> 23:59.939
WE HAD ICE CREAM
AND PLAYED GAMES.

23:59.972 --> 24:02.809
I DIDN'T WANT HER TO GO
WHEN SHE LEFT US WITH LIAM.

24:02.842 --> 24:05.244
- DOES LIAM
HAVE A LAST NAME?

24:05.277 --> 24:06.779
- JUST LIAM.

24:06.813 --> 24:08.247
- YOU CAN'T PROTECT
YOUR CLIENT

24:08.280 --> 24:09.616
WITHOUT PROTECTING
HIS ABUSER.

24:09.649 --> 24:10.683
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

24:10.717 --> 24:12.051
- YOU KNOW I DON'T.

24:12.084 --> 24:13.953
THE THING IS,
UNTIL THE JUDGE RULES,

24:13.986 --> 24:14.987
MY HANDS ARE TIED.

24:15.021 --> 24:16.723
THAT'S IT.

24:16.756 --> 24:20.693
- HE MADE SURE YOU NEVER PAID
OFF YOUR DEBT, DIDN'T HE?

24:20.727 --> 24:23.563
- ON THE HOOK
FOR EVERYTHING.

24:23.596 --> 24:26.699
FOOD, WATER, SHELTER.

24:26.733 --> 24:29.602
- AND THAT'S WHEN HE FORCED YOU
TO HAVE SEX?

24:32.605 --> 24:37.076
- WORD WENT OUT AND PRETTY SOON
THE MONEY WAS SO GOOD,

24:37.109 --> 24:39.512
HE WANTED MORE.

24:39.546 --> 24:42.915
NIGHTS AT THE FARM TURNED
INTO TRIPS TO CITY MOTELS,

24:42.949 --> 24:48.755
THEN WEEKENDS ON MY KNEES TAKING
IT ONE RIGHT AFTER ANOTHER.

24:50.723 --> 24:54.761
- HOW MANY OTHERS WERE FORCED
TO HAVE SEX FOR MONEY?

24:54.794 --> 25:01.267
- THERE WERE TEN OF US,
THEN SIX.

25:01.300 --> 25:03.603
THEN CARLY.

25:03.636 --> 25:09.642
[breathing heavily]

25:09.676 --> 25:12.679
- HEY, YOU'RE SAFE HERE.

25:18.117 --> 25:20.286
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE OTHERS?

25:22.655 --> 25:24.256
- WE WORKED DAYS.

25:24.290 --> 25:27.860
WE WORKED NIGHTS, BUT...

25:27.894 --> 25:33.633
WE DIDN'T ALWAYS
GET TO EAT.

25:33.666 --> 25:35.668
NOT EVEN WHAT WE PICKED.

25:35.702 --> 25:36.936
- WHAT DID THEY GIVE YOU?

25:36.969 --> 25:41.340
- SCRAPS, GARBAGE,
STUFF FROM THE COMPOST HEAP.

25:41.373 --> 25:43.943
EXCEPT WHEN THE GIRLS
GOT PREGNANT.

25:43.976 --> 25:45.878
WE ATE REAL GOOD THEN.

25:46.879 --> 25:48.981
- HOW MANY BABIES WERE BORN?

25:49.015 --> 25:52.118
- THREE.

25:52.151 --> 25:54.987
THEY TOOK THEM AWAY.
WE DIDN'T SEE THEM AGAIN.

25:55.021 --> 25:59.592
- WE KNOW THAT YOUR SISTER,
CARLY, HAD A BABY.

25:59.626 --> 26:01.761
- A LITTLE BOY.

26:01.794 --> 26:04.030
DID THEY KILL HIM?

26:07.133 --> 26:09.702
- I DON'T KNOW.

26:17.143 --> 26:21.881
- CARLY WANTED THAT BABY.

26:21.914 --> 26:26.152
DIDN'T MATTER HOW SHE GOT IT,
SHE SAID IT WAS HERS.

26:34.293 --> 26:35.762
- WHEN LIAM TOOK YOU
TO THESE MOTELS,

26:35.795 --> 26:38.931
DID YOU EVER NOTICE
ANY LANDMARKS OR ROAD SIGNS?

26:40.700 --> 26:44.704
- I'D USUALLY
KEEP MY EYES SHUT.

26:44.737 --> 26:47.273
CAR RIDES MAKE ME SICK.

26:49.709 --> 26:53.345
CARLY USED TO RUB MY BELLY
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

26:53.379 --> 26:57.083
- YOUR SISTER
TOOK CARE OF YOU.

27:05.324 --> 27:08.761
- WE TOOK CARE OF EACH OTHER
UNTIL SHE TRIED TO LEAVE.

27:08.795 --> 27:10.730
[kicks table]

27:13.265 --> 27:16.268
IF SHE LEFT,
THEY WOULD BEAT US.

27:22.775 --> 27:24.276
CARLY KNEW HOW BAD
THEY WOULD HAVE HURT US,

27:24.310 --> 27:26.345
SO WHY'D SHE RUN?

27:26.378 --> 27:28.715
- WELL, MAYBE SHE WAS
TRYING TO GET HELP.

27:32.484 --> 27:37.023
- NO. NO, NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

27:37.056 --> 27:39.692
PLEASE DON'T SAY THAT!
- WHY NOT?

27:39.726 --> 27:42.194
[loud clatter]

27:42.228 --> 27:43.930
- EASY!
EASY, EASY, EASY!

27:43.963 --> 27:46.699
- UHH!
- WHY NOT? WHY NOT?

27:46.733 --> 27:48.000
- LET GO OF ME!

27:48.034 --> 27:49.435
[crying]

27:49.468 --> 27:52.705
- SHH, SHH.
WHY NOT?

27:52.739 --> 27:55.341
- BECAUSE...

27:55.374 --> 28:00.412
IF SHE--IF THAT'S WHAT
SHE WAS TRYING TO DO, THEN--

28:00.446 --> 28:07.319
[crying]

28:07.353 --> 28:10.489
- WHAT DID YOU DO?

28:10.522 --> 28:15.327
- I KILLED CARLY.

28:15.361 --> 28:18.497
I PUSHED HER
AND SHE GOT HIT.

28:18.530 --> 28:21.167
[crying]

28:21.200 --> 28:26.172
I DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS
TRYING TO SAVE US.

28:26.205 --> 28:28.941
I KILLED MY SISTER.

28:28.975 --> 28:32.044
[crying]

28:45.792 --> 28:48.027
- WE NEED MICAH
TO LOOK AT MUG BOOKS,

28:48.060 --> 28:49.528
HELP US FIND
THE WOMAN WHO TOOK HIM.

28:49.561 --> 28:51.964
- THAT'S GOT TO BE
DR. HUANG'S CALL.

28:51.998 --> 28:54.400
- I'M RECOMMENDING IMMUNITY
AND WITNESS PROTECTION.

28:54.433 --> 28:56.903
- NO FAMILY COURT JUDGE
IS GOING TO ACCEPT THAT.

28:56.936 --> 28:59.505
- A FEDERAL COURT JUDGE WILL.
THE FBI'S TAKING OVER.

28:59.538 --> 29:01.841
- GEORGE, HANG ON A SECOND.
WH--WH--WHY--

29:01.874 --> 29:04.476
- HUMAN TRAFFICKING,
SEX TRAFFICKING,

29:04.510 --> 29:07.880
THE MANN ACT,
ALL VIOLATIONS OF U.S. CODE.

29:07.914 --> 29:10.516
THEY TRANSPORTED MINORS
ACROSS STATE LINES

29:10.549 --> 29:12.451
TO PERFORM COMMERCIAL
SEX ACTS FOR PROFIT.

29:12.484 --> 29:13.385
I'VE GOT TO CALL MY BOSS.

29:13.419 --> 29:19.892
- HEY, DOC,
MICAH'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

29:19.926 --> 29:21.560
- HOW ARE YOU
GOING TO STOP ME?

29:21.593 --> 29:25.531
- YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
WITH THE FEDS ON SPEED DIAL.

29:32.304 --> 29:35.041
- CHRIS, YOU'VE COME UP
IN THE WORLD.

29:35.074 --> 29:36.442
- SO HAVE YOU.

29:36.475 --> 29:38.310
MINOR SEX SLAVES
ON THE HOOK,

29:38.344 --> 29:39.545
MISSING
BLACK MARKET INFANTS.

29:39.578 --> 29:41.380
YOUR CASE IS SOLID.
WHY BRING IT TO ME?

29:41.413 --> 29:43.215
- YOU'RE AN ASSISTANT
U.S. ATTORNEY

29:43.249 --> 29:44.516
IN THE EASTERN DISTRICT.

29:44.550 --> 29:46.118
OUR VICTIMS ARE
IN YOUR BACKYARD.

29:46.152 --> 29:48.187
- LONG ISLAND IS GROUND ZERO
FOR IMMIGRANT TRAFFIC.

29:48.220 --> 29:49.588
NOW WE'RE GETTING AMERICANS.

29:49.621 --> 29:53.059
- SO, HOW MANY ARE BEING
ENSLAVED RIGHT NOW?

29:53.092 --> 29:55.494
- GLOBALLY,
ABOUT 27 MILLION.

29:55.527 --> 29:56.829
- AND IN THE U.S.?

29:56.863 --> 29:58.564
- BETWEEN
14,000 AND 18,000.

29:58.597 --> 30:00.032
BUT I THINK
THAT NUMBER'S LOW.

30:00.066 --> 30:01.333
- HOW MANY AMERICANS?

30:01.367 --> 30:04.070
- SO FAR,
NOBODY'S COUNTING.

30:04.103 --> 30:07.139
AN INDONESIAN GIRL GETS RESCUED
HERE FROM THE SEX TRADE,

30:07.173 --> 30:09.608
SHE HAS ACCESS TO
COUNSELING AND TO AID.

30:09.641 --> 30:12.444
BUT A PIMP GETS HIS CLAWS
INTO A KID FROM NEW YORK,

30:12.478 --> 30:16.348
SHE GETS NOTHING.

30:16.382 --> 30:19.285
14-YEAR-OLD ENSLAVED BY
A SUBURBAN FAMILY IN MINNESOTA.

30:19.318 --> 30:22.588
SHE COOKED, SHE CLEANED,
SLEPT IN THE CLOSET.

30:22.621 --> 30:26.558
12-YEAR-OLD SOLD BY HER MOTHER
FOR FIVE GRAND

30:26.592 --> 30:30.362
TO A MIDDLE-AGED MAN
WHO SHARED HER WITH HIS FRIENDS.

30:30.396 --> 30:32.331
NINE-YEAR-OLD PORTLAND GIRL,

30:32.364 --> 30:34.466
TOSSED TO THE STREET
BY HER GRANDMOTHER.

30:34.500 --> 30:36.368
THIS GIRL'S PIMP

30:36.402 --> 30:38.938
CHARGED A PREMIUM
FOR PREPUBESCENCE.

30:38.971 --> 30:41.607
FOR EACH ONE SAVED, THERE ARE
EIGHT MORE JUST LIKE THEM.

30:41.640 --> 30:44.343
CAN'T REALLY DO MUCH WITHOUT
FUNDING FOR DOMESTIC VICTIMS.

30:44.376 --> 30:46.913
- SO WHAT HAPPENS TO MICAH'S
FRIENDS WHEN WE FIND THEM?

30:46.946 --> 30:48.580
- I'LL USE MY BUDGET
TO MAKE SURE

30:48.614 --> 30:50.349
THAT THEY'RE PROTECTED
AND TAKEN CARE OF.

30:50.382 --> 30:53.953
BUT I HAVEN'T DECIDED
IF I'M TAKING YOUR BAIT.

30:56.655 --> 30:58.925
- WE DID THE LEGWORK.

30:58.958 --> 31:01.360
- I HAVE THE TASK FORCE,
THE FUNDING,

31:01.393 --> 31:02.962
AND ALL THE PERSONNEL
I NEED.

31:02.995 --> 31:04.596
- WHO AREN'T FAMILIAR
WITH THE CASE.

31:04.630 --> 31:05.631
WHO HAVE TO BE READ-IN.

31:05.664 --> 31:06.865
THAT'S WASTING
PRECIOUS TIME.

31:06.899 --> 31:11.370
- AND MANHATTAN HAS YET TO MAKE
ONE SEX TRAFFIC CONVICTION.

31:11.403 --> 31:15.307
NOW, WE NEED TO MAKE A LOCAL
EXAMPLE AND THIS IS THE ONE.

31:19.611 --> 31:22.348
COME ON, CHRIS,
JUST HELP US OUT.

31:31.290 --> 31:33.359
- GIVE ME YOUR TIN.

31:38.364 --> 31:39.565
- OOH, LOOK AT THAT.

31:39.598 --> 31:42.434
WE'RE SPECIAL DEPUTY
U.S. MARSHALS.

31:42.468 --> 31:45.404
- CREDENTIALS YOU'LL NEED TO
WORK OUTSIDE YOUR JURISDICTION.

31:45.437 --> 31:47.706
RAISE YOUR RIGHT HAND.

31:47.739 --> 31:50.476
I SOLEMNLY SWEAR
TO SUPPORT AND DEFEND

31:50.509 --> 31:52.544
THE CONSTITUTION
OF THE UNITED STATES

31:52.578 --> 31:56.182
FROM ALL ENEMIES
FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC.

32:03.655 --> 32:06.325
- HOW'D HUANG
TAKE THE BAD NEWS?

32:06.358 --> 32:08.227
- IF I WERE YOU,
I'D KEEP MY DISTANCE.

32:08.260 --> 32:11.397
I DIDN'T KNOW HE USED
THAT KIND OF LANGUAGE.

32:11.430 --> 32:13.599
LET ME SEE 'EM.
- ALL RIGHT.

32:13.632 --> 32:15.467
- IT'S ONLY TEMPORARY.

32:15.501 --> 32:18.104
- HEY, FIN.
ANY LUCK ON THE I.D.?

32:18.137 --> 32:20.506
- SO FAR, THE KID'S PULLED
SEVEN POSSIBLE MATCHES.

32:20.539 --> 32:23.575
I RAN THEM ALL.
NOTHING.

32:30.349 --> 32:35.554
- VICTORIA REYES
AKA TINA REYES AKA KIKI RAMOS.

32:35.587 --> 32:36.755
THE LIST GOES ON AND ON.

32:36.788 --> 32:38.424
- WELL, NO WONDER
WE COULDN'T FIND HER.

32:38.457 --> 32:41.660
- MAKE SURE YOU LOG MAGDA PALOMA
TO REYES'S LIST OF ALIASES.

32:41.693 --> 32:44.130
SHE WAS ARRESTED IN MARYLAND.
WHERE IS SHE NOW?

32:44.163 --> 32:46.465
- SHE WAS DOING TIME IN JESSUP
WHEN SHE DISAPPEARED.

32:46.498 --> 32:49.335
- THEY CUT HER LOOSE?
- NO, BUT HER RECORD'S SEALED.

32:49.368 --> 32:51.603
- WELL, SHE FLIPPED FOR A DEAL
AND GOT WITNESS PROTECTION.

32:51.637 --> 32:53.472
- WILL THE U.S. MARSHALS
GIVE US ACCESS?

32:53.505 --> 32:55.241
- NOT EVEN WITH
THEIR LAST DYING BREATH.

32:55.274 --> 32:57.143
YOU MIGHT BE PLAYING
FOR THEIR TEAM RIGHT NOW,

32:57.176 --> 32:58.644
BUT EVEN I DON'T HAVE
ACCESS TO WITSEC.

32:58.677 --> 33:01.247
- THE AUSA ASSIGNED
TO THE CASE DOES.

33:01.280 --> 33:03.449
- WE'RE VERY TERRITORIAL.

33:03.482 --> 33:04.550
- WELL, WHAT KIND OF PRESS
DO YOU WANT?

33:04.583 --> 33:06.152
LIVE VICTIMS OR DEAD KIDS?

33:12.124 --> 33:13.725
- WE'RE CLOSE TO TRIAL,

33:13.759 --> 33:16.595
AND I DON'T WANT MY CASE
DERAILED, CHRIS.

33:16.628 --> 33:18.497
- THAT'S NOT
WHY WE'RE HERE.

33:18.530 --> 33:20.399
- MS. REYES WON'T TALK
WITHOUT IMMUNITY.

33:20.432 --> 33:22.601
- SHE'S GOT IT.

33:22.634 --> 33:24.636
- JUST HOW BIG
IS YOUR CASE?

33:24.670 --> 33:26.538
- QUIT FISHING.
TELL YOUR WITNESS TO COOPERATE.

33:26.572 --> 33:27.706
- DON'T CARE WHAT HE SAYS.

33:27.739 --> 33:29.375
I DON'T HAVE TO TALK TO YOU.

33:29.408 --> 33:30.376
- THEN I'LL HAVE A JUDGE

33:30.409 --> 33:32.478
VACATE THE DEAL YOU HAVE
ON THE TABLE RIGHT NOW.

33:32.511 --> 33:35.181
NO WITNESS PROTECTION,
NO IMMUNITY.

33:35.214 --> 33:36.482
- YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

33:36.515 --> 33:38.217
YOU'RE THREATENING
MY HUMAN TRAFFICKING CASE.

33:38.250 --> 33:40.552
- I CAN AND I WILL.

33:40.586 --> 33:46.392
MY CASE IS BIGGER,
AND THE AG LOVES HEADLINES.

33:50.129 --> 33:56.568
- OKAY. THESE KIDS.
YOU KNOW 'EM?

34:02.241 --> 34:05.677
- YEAH.
GOT A THOUSAND BUCKS EACH.

34:05.711 --> 34:08.480
- WHO'D YOU SELL THEM TO?

34:11.517 --> 34:13.652
- LIAM AND JULIE RYAN.

34:13.685 --> 34:15.254
WANNABE FARMERS.

34:15.287 --> 34:16.555
- WHERE'D YOU DROP THEM OFF?

34:16.588 --> 34:17.489
- I DIDN'T.

34:17.523 --> 34:20.192
LIAM MET ME
AND TOOK THEM OFF MY HANDS.

34:20.226 --> 34:21.527
- SO YOU NEVER
SAW THE FARM?

34:21.560 --> 34:23.595
- GUY WAS CAREFUL.

34:23.629 --> 34:26.332
WE TALKED ON BURN PHONES
HE GAVE ME.

34:26.365 --> 34:28.367
TOLD ME HE NEEDED
SOME MERCHANDISE

34:28.400 --> 34:30.702
TO WORK HIS FIELDS,
AND I GOT IT FOR HIM.

34:30.736 --> 34:32.238
- WHERE'D HE TELL YOU
TO MEET HIM?

34:32.271 --> 34:35.607
- FARM AND FEED STORE
IN WYANDANCH.

34:35.641 --> 34:37.409
- HOW MANY KIDS
YOU DELIVER?

34:37.443 --> 34:38.744
- SEVEN.

34:38.777 --> 34:40.679
HEARD THEY TRICKED
THE KIDS OUT.

34:40.712 --> 34:42.181
- DO YOU REMEMBER
ANY OF THEIR NAMES?

34:42.214 --> 34:43.749
- DIDN'T ASK, DIDN'T CARE.

34:43.782 --> 34:45.717
- BECAUSE ALL YOU SAW
WERE DOLLARS SIGNS

34:45.751 --> 34:50.522
INSTEAD OF HUMAN BEINGS.

34:50.556 --> 34:52.724
- THAT'S ALL WE ARE, HONEY.

34:52.758 --> 34:57.363
NO ONE CAME TO MY RESCUE.

34:57.396 --> 34:59.698
- OKAY, HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
SERVICING THE RYANS?

34:59.731 --> 35:01.533
- LESS THAN A YEAR.

35:01.567 --> 35:04.636
I STOPPED TAKING THEIR CALLS
WHEN I HEARD A RUMOR

35:04.670 --> 35:07.506
THEY BURNED SOME WORKERS
WHEN THE HEAT WAS CLOSING IN.

35:07.539 --> 35:13.312
- THEY KILLED THEIR SLAVES?
- JUST THE KIDS.

35:13.345 --> 35:14.746
ILLEGALS
ARE TOO SCARED TO TALK.

35:14.780 --> 35:16.715
- WHERE'D THAT HAPPEN?

35:16.748 --> 35:18.784
- FLORIDA, I THINK.

35:18.817 --> 35:21.453
MADE THEM DRINK
THE KOOL-AID.

35:21.487 --> 35:26.558
- EL, FIN RAN
LIAM AND JULIE RYAN.

35:26.592 --> 35:27.693
THERE'S NO RECORD OF THEM

35:27.726 --> 35:28.794
LEASING ANY LAND
IN SUFFOLK COUNTY.

35:28.827 --> 35:31.230
NO BANK ACCOUNTS, NO CREDIT.
- THEY'RE PAYING CASH.

35:31.263 --> 35:34.366
- OKAY, HAVE FIN FAX THEIR
PHOTOS OVER TO THAT STORE.

35:34.400 --> 35:37.503
MAYBE THAT'S THEIR REGULAR
PICK-UP SPOT.

35:37.536 --> 35:40.672
- PUBLIC RECORDS SHOW
LIAM AND JULIE RYAN

35:40.706 --> 35:43.575
LOST THEIR FAMILY FARM IN
MARYLAND TO FORECLOSURE.

35:43.609 --> 35:45.811
THEY MOVED TO NORTH CAROLINA,
THEN FLORIDA.

35:45.844 --> 35:47.379
- ANY WANTS OR WARRANTS?

35:47.413 --> 35:48.347
- ONLY BECAUSE THEY SKIPPED

35:48.380 --> 35:50.649
BEFORE THE SARASOTA P.D.
COULD QUESTION THEM.

35:50.682 --> 35:51.350
- WHAT FOR?

35:51.383 --> 35:52.718
- NEIGHBORS
WERE COMPLAINING

35:52.751 --> 35:54.520
THEY WERE USING
ILLEGAL LABOR.

35:54.553 --> 35:57.289
WHEN THE COPS GOT THERE,
ALL THEY FOUND WERE BODIES.

35:57.323 --> 35:58.490
- HOW MANY?

35:58.524 --> 36:01.627
- FIVE KIDS BETWEEN
THE AGES 9 AND 16.

36:01.660 --> 36:02.661
- CAUSE OF DEATH?

36:02.694 --> 36:05.931
- CYANIDE
MIXED WITH GRAPE JUICE.

36:05.964 --> 36:08.600
- THE RYANS ARE LEASING
TEN ACRES OFF THE BOOKS

36:08.634 --> 36:09.468
FROM A FARMER
GOING BANKRUPT.

36:09.501 --> 36:11.870
- OKAY, TEXT ME
THE ADDRESS TO MY PHONE.

36:11.903 --> 36:14.273
- I'LL CALL SUFFOLK P.D.
AND HAVE THEM MEET YOU.

36:14.306 --> 36:15.607
- NO LIGHTS, NO SIRENS.

36:15.641 --> 36:17.643
WE SPOOK THEM,
THEY'LL PUT THOSE KIDS DOWN.

36:21.647 --> 36:23.482
- THEY'RE IN WYANDANCH,
OFF ROUTE 1.

36:23.515 --> 36:27.286
- GET SEARCH AND ARREST WARRANTS
ASAP ON LIAM AND JULIE RYAN.

36:27.319 --> 36:30.356
DOMESTIC SEXUAL MINOR TRAFFIC
AND HUMAN TRAFFIC.

36:30.389 --> 36:33.925
- WE NEED FIRST RESPONDERS
ON STAND-BY WITH CYANOKITS.

36:49.341 --> 36:52.411
- ELLIOT...
- I SEE THEM.

36:54.346 --> 36:55.514
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

36:55.547 --> 36:57.215
- PLAYING CHICKEN.

37:02.654 --> 37:06.925
[tires squeal]

37:10.829 --> 37:11.830
- SHOW US YOUR HANDS!

37:11.863 --> 37:15.334
- I'VE GOT IT! GO! GO!

37:18.337 --> 37:20.506
PASSENGER, PUT YOUR HANDS
ON THE DASH!

37:20.539 --> 37:22.441
YOU, GET OUT!

37:24.610 --> 37:26.612
- RIGHT THERE.

37:26.645 --> 37:29.648
NOW, YOU, UNDO YOUR BELT.
GET OUT.

37:45.831 --> 37:49.335
- HELLO?
IS ANYBODY HERE?

37:50.569 --> 37:51.903
HELLO?

37:51.937 --> 37:54.606
DON'T BE AFRAID.
I'M A POLICE OFFICER.

37:54.640 --> 37:56.575
- ANY SIGN OF THE KIDS?

37:58.444 --> 37:59.945
- ROOT CELLAR.

37:59.978 --> 38:01.613
MICAH WAS KEPT UNDERGROUND.

38:01.647 --> 38:03.315
WE NEED
THOSE EMTs HERE NOW.

38:03.349 --> 38:05.551
[dialing phone number]

38:10.956 --> 38:13.925
[children coughing]

38:13.959 --> 38:17.596
- HONEY.
HEY, SWEETIE?

38:17.629 --> 38:19.531
HELP IS ON THE WAY,
GUYS.

38:19.565 --> 38:23.435
[rattling]

38:26.638 --> 38:29.007
- EMT COMING IN!

38:35.113 --> 38:36.582
- HOW MUCH CYANIDE
WERE THEY GIVEN?

38:36.615 --> 38:39.718
- I DON'T KNOW.
CAN YOU HELP THEM?

38:39.751 --> 38:41.587
- HYDROXYCOBALIMIN
SHOULD BIND THE CRYSTALS.

38:41.620 --> 38:45.591
WE'LL FOLLOW UP WITH THIOSULFATE
IVs AND HYPERBARIC OXYGEN.

38:45.624 --> 38:46.792
- ARE THEY GONNA MAKE IT?

38:46.825 --> 38:48.360
- IT'S A 10,
15-MINUTE WINDOW.

38:48.394 --> 38:51.397
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

38:55.734 --> 38:57.403
- FULL BODY CHAINS?

38:57.436 --> 38:59.137
- THEY'RE LUCKY
THEY'RE NOT IN BODY BAGS.

38:59.170 --> 39:00.271
- THEY INVOKED RIGHT AWAY.

39:00.305 --> 39:02.374
- OF COURSE THEY DID.
HOW ABOUT THE KIDS THEY SOLD?

39:02.408 --> 39:03.642
- WE'RE WORKING ON IT.

39:03.675 --> 39:04.510
WE FOUND A LAPTOP
IN THEIR TRUCK,

39:04.543 --> 39:06.845
ALONG WITH A SUITCASE
FULL OF CASH.

39:06.878 --> 39:09.781
- DO US A FAVOR. PUT THEM
IN A DEEP, DARK HOLE.

39:09.815 --> 39:13.585
- BEST I CAN DO IS MAXIMUM
SECURITY, LIFE WITH NO PAROLE.

39:13.619 --> 39:16.354
- WORKS FOR ME.

39:20.125 --> 39:21.827
- THANK YOU.

39:21.860 --> 39:25.397
- DOOR'S ALWAYS OPEN.

39:29.968 --> 39:32.504
- MY DAUGHTER'S DEAD,

39:32.538 --> 39:35.541
AND MY SON KILLED HER.

39:37.208 --> 39:38.744
HOW DO I FIX THIS?

39:38.777 --> 39:41.480
- IT'S GONNA TAKE TIME,
MR. HOLBART.

39:41.513 --> 39:43.048
MICAH'S NOT BEING CHARGED,

39:43.081 --> 39:46.452
THOUGH HE HAS TO HAVE
MANDATORY COUNSELING.

39:46.485 --> 39:49.521
I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
IS THAT HE FEEL SAFE.

39:49.555 --> 39:51.823
- AND I LIVE IN A CAR.
- NOT ANYMORE.

39:51.857 --> 39:56.528
WE TALKED TO A SHELTER
GEARED TOWARDS FAMILIES.

39:56.562 --> 39:59.698
IT'S TEMPORARY HOUSING
FOR ALL OF YOU

39:59.731 --> 40:03.702
UNTIL YOU CAN GET BACK
ON YOUR FEET.

40:03.735 --> 40:09.708
- YOU'RE HELPING ME
AFTER I SCREWED UP?

40:09.741 --> 40:12.644
- MICAH'S NOT GONNA GET
ANY BETTER WITHOUT YOU.

40:14.646 --> 40:16.748
- THANK YOU.

40:31.697 --> 40:33.565
- I'M SORRY.

40:33.599 --> 40:35.734
- IT'S OKAY, MICAH.

40:35.767 --> 40:39.771
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
IT'S MINE.
