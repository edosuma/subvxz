WEBVTT

00:08.076 --> 00:10.211
The plugs in your arms
and head are gone.

00:10.244 --> 00:11.979
Morpheus?

00:12.012 --> 00:13.247
Your appearance now

00:13.281 --> 00:15.883
is what we call
residual self image.

00:15.916 --> 00:19.387
It's a mental projection
of your digital self.

00:19.420 --> 00:20.854
This isn't real?

00:22.390 --> 00:24.692
What is real?
How do you define real?

00:24.725 --> 00:26.827
Real is simply
electrical signals

00:26.860 --> 00:28.229
interpreted by
your brain.

00:28.262 --> 00:30.198
This is
the world that you know,

00:30.231 --> 00:32.966
the world as it was
at the end of the 20th Century.

00:34.268 --> 00:37.037
It exists now only as
a neural interactive simulation

00:37.071 --> 00:39.273
that we call
the Matrix.

00:39.307 --> 00:41.609
You've been living
in a dream world, Neo.

00:41.642 --> 00:44.678
This is the world
as it exists today.

00:46.814 --> 00:48.416
That's not
what Y2K's gonna be.

00:48.449 --> 00:49.583
You don't
know that.

00:49.617 --> 00:51.185
No one knows
what's going to happen.

00:51.219 --> 00:53.221
Well, I'm not gonna lose
my hair, that's for sure.

00:53.254 --> 00:54.688
You think
the world could end?

00:54.722 --> 00:56.457
Yes.
The Millennium Bug is coming!

00:56.490 --> 00:58.025
It's the bug
of the century.

00:58.058 --> 01:01.095
I caught a big bug
with my bra today.

01:01.129 --> 01:04.765
More like
a 36 Double Dead.
Ma!

01:04.798 --> 01:06.367
Guys,
this is the first day

01:06.400 --> 01:07.935
of maybe
our last summer of our lives.

01:07.968 --> 01:10.871
We've gotta do it all --
ice cream trucks, sunburns,

01:10.904 --> 01:12.973
water slides,
skinny dipping,

01:13.006 --> 01:14.208
ice cream trucks.

01:14.242 --> 01:15.243
Who's with me?

01:15.276 --> 01:16.910
Jessica: I am.

01:16.944 --> 01:17.645
Mom?

01:17.678 --> 01:18.812
For the next
three months

01:18.846 --> 01:20.548
while I'm busy
studying for grad school,

01:20.581 --> 01:23.451
you will be by my side
PSAT prepping.

01:23.484 --> 01:24.985
Study buddies.

01:32.160 --> 01:32.993
No!

01:55.015 --> 01:57.418

02:07.728 --> 02:09.497
* I'm fresh off the boat

02:12.466 --> 02:13.601
This sucks.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.035
All my friends are
going on cool vacations

02:15.068 --> 02:16.370
and I'm stuck studying.

02:16.404 --> 02:18.138
Sounds like you're going on
a ton of trips...

02:18.172 --> 02:19.873
on the Complain Train.

02:19.907 --> 02:21.842
I don't need
all this college prep.

02:21.875 --> 02:24.545
Eddie, this is not just
your future at stake

02:24.578 --> 02:26.046
but my reputation.

02:26.079 --> 02:28.649
How am I gonna become
a respected school principal

02:28.682 --> 02:31.018
if I can't even get my own son
into a top college?

02:31.051 --> 02:32.119
Whoa, top college?

02:32.152 --> 02:33.954
I was thinking more like
Tier 2, Tier 3.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.123
I want less pressure,
more fun.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.525
Sit around and relax.

02:37.558 --> 02:39.227
Rejuvenate from the stress
of high school.

02:39.260 --> 02:41.395
You get out every day
at 1:45.

02:41.429 --> 02:43.497
I know, and my first class
starts at 9:00.

02:43.531 --> 02:45.733
Eddie, what did you do
to the tub?

02:45.766 --> 02:48.236
Oh, that's Gia,
my mega water balloon.

02:51.739 --> 02:53.173
I'm leaving Gia
in the tub

02:53.207 --> 02:55.543
until I bulk up enough
to be able to throw her.

02:55.576 --> 02:56.677
She big.

02:56.710 --> 02:58.011
"She big," Louis.

02:58.045 --> 02:59.980
No water balloons.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.649
Real world is coming.
College.

03:01.682 --> 03:02.750
You need to grow up.

03:02.783 --> 03:04.585
You've been saying that
since I was 3.

03:04.618 --> 03:06.320
College.
I'm so jealous of you.

03:06.354 --> 03:07.655
Best time of your life.

03:07.688 --> 03:10.258
You know, I was a bit
of a campus legend myself.

03:10.291 --> 03:11.725
Please don't start.

03:11.759 --> 03:13.361
They called me
"The Buffalo."

03:13.394 --> 03:15.563
Why'd they call you
"The Buffalo"?

03:15.596 --> 03:17.231
Because you couldn't find
a hotter wingman.

03:17.265 --> 03:19.600
Hey,
what about Maryland?

03:19.633 --> 03:22.202
Go to your old man --
and old woman's alma...mata?

03:22.236 --> 03:24.204
Almamatta.
Alma mamata?

03:24.238 --> 03:26.374
Alma...
Go to our college?

03:26.407 --> 03:30.043
No. Maryland did not
make the list.

03:30.077 --> 03:31.879
Do I get a say
in any of this?

03:31.912 --> 03:34.214
Oh, Eddie,
if only the PSATs

03:34.248 --> 03:35.749
were verbal, math,
and comedy.

03:37.918 --> 03:40.120
Don't you think
this is a little much?

03:40.153 --> 03:41.722
You don't want
to burn Eddie out on college

03:41.755 --> 03:43.090
before he even
gets in.

03:43.123 --> 03:45.293
We have to stay on him
or he strays.

03:45.326 --> 03:47.428
He proves this
over and over again.

03:47.461 --> 03:49.930
If I recall,
you weren't exactly

03:49.963 --> 03:51.932
the most focused student
in college.

03:51.965 --> 03:55.769
We do not talk about
my college days, remember?

03:55.803 --> 03:58.772
Especially not in front of
our impressionable son

03:58.806 --> 04:01.575
who has been talking about
going to school

04:01.609 --> 04:03.277
in "one of the Arizonas."

04:03.311 --> 04:05.713
Just saying, you made
some questionable choices and --

04:05.746 --> 04:06.947
That was different!

04:06.980 --> 04:09.317
It's way more
competitive now.

04:09.350 --> 04:10.551
My sister, Connie,

04:10.584 --> 04:12.219
started prepping Justin
a year out,

04:12.252 --> 04:13.887
and he got into
a crap school.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.289
He's a freshman
at UCLA.

04:15.323 --> 04:16.457
That's a great school.

04:16.490 --> 04:18.292
Ugh, you sound
just like Connie.

04:18.326 --> 04:20.127
I want better
for Eddie,

04:20.160 --> 04:21.962
not just so I can
rub it in Connie's face,

04:21.995 --> 04:24.998
but because I want him to have
the best possible future,

04:25.032 --> 04:27.301
which I could also
rub in Connie's face.

04:27.335 --> 04:29.169
Well, it might help Eddie
get more excited

04:29.202 --> 04:31.772
if he knew there was more to it
than just academics.

04:31.805 --> 04:33.407
It's about
making connections,

04:33.441 --> 04:35.409
socializing,
living on your own --

04:35.443 --> 04:36.777
the whole experience.

04:36.810 --> 04:39.179
Trust me,
there is no experience

04:39.212 --> 04:41.349
like the feeling
Eddie will get

04:41.382 --> 04:43.183
when he
graduates Harvard

04:43.216 --> 04:46.119
and sees my glowing
stare of approval.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.659
Julius: Whoa!

04:51.692 --> 04:54.027
Do I look cool now?

04:54.061 --> 04:55.963
Mr. Ice.

04:55.996 --> 04:57.365
Yeah, just breeze
on through.

04:57.398 --> 04:58.699
Emery, join us.

04:58.732 --> 05:00.701
We're watching
Arnold Schwarzenegger's "Twins."

05:00.734 --> 05:03.003
It's Danny DeVito's
"Twins."

05:03.036 --> 05:05.606
Perfect timing.
Easy on the eyes.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.941
There's rumors of Arnold
entering politics,

05:07.975 --> 05:09.443
so I've become
a big fan.

05:09.477 --> 05:12.045
How can you sit and watch TV
with this Y2K thing coming?

05:12.079 --> 05:13.514
We're totally unprepared.

05:13.547 --> 05:16.216
We need to start stocking up
on supplies, rations,

05:16.249 --> 05:18.686
valuables we can use
to trade with other survivors.

05:18.719 --> 05:20.954
That's gonna require
some cash.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.022
Exactly.

05:22.055 --> 05:23.624
We need
to get summer jobs.

05:23.657 --> 05:24.792
Mm.

05:24.825 --> 05:27.495
Act responsible
while everyone else gets crazy.

05:27.528 --> 05:28.729
Or live it up.

05:28.762 --> 05:31.465
We won't be around
to face the consequences.

05:31.499 --> 05:33.266
Y2K!

05:43.677 --> 05:45.012
Something just clicked,

05:45.045 --> 05:47.147
and I fell on board
with sunglasses.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.517
I'm just jealous you actually
got to go somewhere this summer.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.652
Not somewhere, Eddie.
Ball State.

05:51.685 --> 05:52.720
Damn.

05:52.753 --> 05:54.988
You were on
a college campus? Fun!

05:55.022 --> 05:57.190
Oh, yeah.
We piled into the Suburban,

05:57.224 --> 05:58.592
popped in some Reba,

05:58.626 --> 06:00.428
and Burger King'd our way
straight to my sister's dorm.

06:00.461 --> 06:01.429
Ah.

06:01.462 --> 06:02.930
Eddie, that's it.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.732
We'll take a family trip
to college.

06:04.765 --> 06:06.534
That'd be sick!

06:06.567 --> 06:08.936
Until Mom makes me take PSATs
the whole time.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.370
I think
you'll be surprised.

06:10.404 --> 06:11.705
Once your mom's
on campus,

06:11.739 --> 06:13.173
you may see
a different side of her.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.875
There's no chance
we're even getting there.

06:14.908 --> 06:17.010
Mom always says
sleep is our vacation.

06:17.044 --> 06:18.746
Trust me,
I know her weak spot.

06:18.779 --> 06:20.080
Connie.

06:20.113 --> 06:22.750
I know my weak spot --
toe massages.

06:25.118 --> 06:26.787
Family trip
to California!

06:26.820 --> 06:28.456
Oh, that's great.
Whose family?

06:28.489 --> 06:29.557
Us.
Us family.

06:29.590 --> 06:31.892
Dad's taking us
to visit Justin at UCLA.

06:31.925 --> 06:33.193
He's in summer classes.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.463
We can't.
We just got new jobs.

06:35.496 --> 06:36.797
Use your vacation
and sick days.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.298
They'll understand.
I'm a boss.

06:38.331 --> 06:40.367
Dad just
Y2K'd our jobs.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.636
Louis, we're saving
for college,

06:42.670 --> 06:44.204
not wasting money
to go visit one

06:44.237 --> 06:45.739
on the other side
of the country.

06:45.773 --> 06:47.941
My brother flies for Delta.
He'll get us free tickets.

06:47.975 --> 06:49.477
We can stay with Justin --
no hotel.

06:49.510 --> 06:50.811
And the best part?

06:50.844 --> 06:53.146
If Eddie turns down UCLA
for Harvard,

06:53.180 --> 06:55.282
you can rub it
in Connie's face.

06:59.953 --> 07:01.822
Okay!
Pack your bags, boys.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.857
We're going to college!

07:11.031 --> 07:13.501
Does your roommate have
any diseases, Justin?

07:14.635 --> 07:15.636
Ugh.
Never mind.

07:15.669 --> 07:17.104
Justin: I assumed
when you called

07:17.137 --> 07:18.772
it would be just Eddie
staying with me.

07:18.806 --> 07:20.107
Well, that's why
you're in college --

07:20.140 --> 07:21.441
to learn things
you didn't know.

07:21.475 --> 07:23.410
Hey, how come
there's no sock on the door?

07:23.443 --> 07:24.411
Kidding.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.446
Amazing bookstore.

07:26.480 --> 07:27.615
Oh, Marley, nice.

07:27.648 --> 07:29.416
No woman, no cry...
mon.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.351
Oh, sweet. I had one of these.

07:31.384 --> 07:34.087
Mine was red.
If it could talk, whoo.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.289
Louis, calm down.
Where's Grandma and the boys?

07:36.323 --> 07:37.858
She said
she needed the campus ATM

07:37.891 --> 07:39.259
before they
went sightseeing.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.494
They're here, too?

07:41.461 --> 07:43.130
Great.

07:43.163 --> 07:44.965
Fill out the form
and you'll get a credit card

07:44.998 --> 07:46.299
and a free T-shirt.

07:46.333 --> 07:48.702
Grandma, we don't have jobs
to pay these off, remember?

07:48.736 --> 07:49.837
Grandma: So?

07:57.144 --> 07:59.312
Y2K.

07:59.346 --> 08:00.380
She's right,
Emery.

08:00.413 --> 08:02.282
We tried to do
the responsible thing,

08:02.315 --> 08:03.283
and it didn't matter.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.152
Let's just live it up
while we can.

08:05.185 --> 08:06.219
Y2K.

08:07.054 --> 08:08.622
We're rich!

08:08.656 --> 08:10.357
Y2K!
Y2K!Y2K!

08:10.390 --> 08:12.359
Whoo!

08:12.392 --> 08:14.728
Wow.
Your own fridge. Cool.

08:14.762 --> 08:15.896
Louis:
We didn't have those

08:15.929 --> 08:16.897
in my day.

08:16.930 --> 08:18.732
You just had to
let stuff spoil.

08:19.767 --> 08:21.034
Oh!

08:21.068 --> 08:23.303
There she is.
It's all coming back.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.805
Whoa.
What'd you just do?

08:24.838 --> 08:25.873
Nothing.

08:25.906 --> 08:27.641
Just trying to clean up
this hellhole.

08:27.675 --> 08:31.211
So, uh, J-bird,
the Huangs are at college!

08:31.244 --> 08:32.412
What's the plan?

08:32.445 --> 08:33.513
I have
a midterm today

08:33.547 --> 08:34.882
and I was gonna use
the morning to study.

08:34.915 --> 08:36.884
Please.

08:36.917 --> 08:39.486
How hard can the tests be
at Eddie's safety school?

08:39.519 --> 08:40.721
UCLA?

08:40.754 --> 08:43.156
I got a 4.0,
good SAT,

08:43.190 --> 08:44.825
and a rare sit-down
with the Dean of Admissions

08:44.858 --> 08:46.159
and I still
got wait-listed.

08:46.193 --> 08:47.494
It's not easy
to get into.

08:48.461 --> 08:50.698
Oh. Quick,
hide the Sambuca.

08:50.731 --> 08:51.732
It's the RA.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.767
This is Kip,
my roommate.

08:53.801 --> 08:56.604
This is my family.
They're staying with us.

08:56.637 --> 08:58.105
Doesn't matter
to me.

08:58.138 --> 09:00.073
My midterms just posted.
I flunked out.

09:00.107 --> 09:02.610
AP classes,
years of prep school,

09:02.643 --> 09:04.077
valedictorian...

09:04.111 --> 09:06.046
just to be back
in my dad's butcher shop,

09:06.079 --> 09:08.448
cutting ham
for Mrs. Josephs.

09:08.481 --> 09:09.750
Wait a minute.

09:09.783 --> 09:12.686
So UCLA isn't a school
for dum-dums like you?

09:12.720 --> 09:15.222
It's the Harvard
of California.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.225
Okay,
new itinerary --

09:18.258 --> 09:20.060
campus tour,
three class lectures,

09:20.093 --> 09:21.729
and a meeting with
the Dean of Admissions.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.363
Jessica, I thought
a meeting with the Dean

09:23.396 --> 09:24.364
was impossible
to get.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.733
I reached out
to your RV salesman.

09:25.766 --> 09:26.734
He put in a call.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.068
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?

09:28.101 --> 09:29.269
Yeah.

09:29.302 --> 09:31.404
Apparently he's some kind of
a big deal around here.

09:31.438 --> 09:33.106
Did he sell RVs
in college?

09:33.140 --> 09:34.107
It's industrious.

09:34.141 --> 09:35.275
Dad, you said

09:35.308 --> 09:36.777
Mom would be different
once we got here,

09:36.810 --> 09:39.312
but College Mom
is even worse.

09:39.346 --> 09:40.781
* I'm going, going

09:40.814 --> 09:42.950
* Back, back to Cali, Cali

09:42.983 --> 09:44.785
* I'm going, going

09:44.818 --> 09:47.721
So, do you want to get a picture
with a "celebrity"?

09:47.755 --> 09:49.723
Marilyn Monroe?
Rocky?

09:49.757 --> 09:51.725
That guy with
a spot-on Whoopi Goldberg?

09:51.759 --> 09:53.393
I don't know,
we've spent a lot.

09:53.426 --> 09:56.329
Grandma,
what's going on?

09:56.363 --> 09:58.666
Me and Danny are going to
take the limo

09:58.699 --> 10:00.333
and do
some adult things.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.335
Uh, Grandma,
that's not Danny DeVito.

10:02.369 --> 10:04.738
Show them, Danny.
Do the Batman.

10:04.772 --> 10:06.740
Wah-wah.

10:06.774 --> 10:09.509
So, you're just
gonna ditch us

10:09.542 --> 10:10.978
in the middle
of Los Angeles?

10:11.011 --> 10:12.579
Oh, Y2K!

10:12.612 --> 10:14.782
Every man
for themselves.

10:14.815 --> 10:15.783
Again, Penguin!

10:15.816 --> 10:16.784
Wah-wah.

10:16.817 --> 10:19.452
Have fun.

10:20.688 --> 10:22.522
Do you ever worry
for Grandma's safety?

10:22.555 --> 10:24.958
I worry
for that guy's safety.

10:28.028 --> 10:29.963
Uh, excuse me,
ma'am.

10:29.997 --> 10:33.333
Uhp, looks like Jessica's
"Bruin" up another question.

10:33.366 --> 10:35.869
Because it's the UCLA Bruins.

10:35.903 --> 10:38.138
Man, this girl is on a pun run
like I've never seen.

10:38.171 --> 10:39.339
It's effortless.

10:39.372 --> 10:41.341
Can you tell us
what the library hours are?

10:41.374 --> 10:42.642
I can,

10:42.676 --> 10:45.713
but the librarians have asked me
to keep it hush-hush.

10:45.746 --> 10:47.480
Oh, you can't
teach this.

10:47.514 --> 10:49.149
A pimps
and hoes party?

10:49.182 --> 10:51.318
Yes and yes.
Ooh,
sounds fun.

10:51.351 --> 10:52.519
Eddie,
pay attention.

10:52.552 --> 10:54.855
You need to remember
every detail about the school

10:54.888 --> 10:56.990
so you can impress
the Dean of Admissions later.

10:59.893 --> 11:02.029
Hey, uh,
I know you mean well,

11:02.062 --> 11:03.663
but maybe you can ease up
on Eddie.

11:03.697 --> 11:04.832
Ease up?

11:04.865 --> 11:06.499
I'm trying to get our son
focused on college.

11:06.533 --> 11:08.068
Well, you don't get
a donkey to a cornfield

11:08.101 --> 11:09.069
by whipping him.

11:09.102 --> 11:10.237
You show him
the corn --

11:10.270 --> 11:12.505
"Hey donkey,
look at all this tasty corn!"

11:12.539 --> 11:14.641
Donkeys don't eat corn.
Well,
something does.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.643
I think you mean a pig.
A pig'll eat anything.

11:16.676 --> 11:17.845
I know about pigs.

11:17.878 --> 11:20.213
The point is this is
supposed to be fun for Eddie.

11:20.247 --> 11:22.883
College is not
supposed to be fun, okay?

11:22.916 --> 11:24.151
Oh, is that so?

11:24.184 --> 11:26.553
Um, excuse me,
uh, Pun Master,

11:26.586 --> 11:28.655
have you ever had a student
get in trouble

11:28.688 --> 11:30.190
for streaking
in the cafeteria

11:30.223 --> 11:32.692
instead of studying
for her econ final?

11:32.726 --> 11:34.728
Louis,
don't do this.
Follow-up question.

11:34.762 --> 11:36.429
You guys ever hear of
a Messy Jessie?

11:36.463 --> 11:37.765
Get ready for this,
Eddie.

11:37.798 --> 11:39.933
* ...leads to shots,
grit your teeth *

11:39.967 --> 11:41.334
Drink.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.703
* You run for cover so discreet,
why don't they *

11:43.737 --> 11:46.039
Drink.
Tough one, Sarah.

11:46.073 --> 11:48.541
Man,
I love Tuesdays.

11:48.575 --> 11:51.444
What should we do with
this kayak that I "borrowed"?

11:51.478 --> 11:52.780
And another time,

11:52.813 --> 11:55.548
she got her hands on a huge tub
of industrial glue --

11:55.582 --> 11:57.350
Okay, Louis,
that's enough.

11:57.384 --> 12:00.353
And now her son knows
that his mom was fun.

12:00.387 --> 12:01.621
Pretty cool,
right, Eddie?

12:01.654 --> 12:04.457
Uh...Eddie?

12:04.491 --> 12:05.926
Where'd he go?

12:10.397 --> 12:11.631
Emery:
After this,

12:11.664 --> 12:14.134
I wanna see a TV taping
with a live studio audience.

12:14.167 --> 12:16.770
What?
I'm not doing that.
Why not?

12:16.804 --> 12:19.472
Because our time is finite,
and I don't wanna waste it

12:19.506 --> 12:21.809
watching garbage
with a bunch of zoo people.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.476
I'm thinking
of becoming an actor.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.112
You and everyone else.

12:25.145 --> 12:27.447
No, I wanna go
to Muscle Beach,

12:27.480 --> 12:29.749
see where Arnold began
his political career.

12:29.783 --> 12:30.784
What's the point
of that?

12:30.818 --> 12:32.219
What's the point
in anything?

12:32.252 --> 12:33.286
Y2K's coming.

12:33.320 --> 12:34.888
Oh, poor baby.

12:34.922 --> 12:37.124
Grandma got DeVito,
so you want some Arnold.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.992
Better actor
than you'll ever be.

12:39.026 --> 12:40.961
Maybe you're right.

12:40.994 --> 12:42.262
The world's ending.

12:42.295 --> 12:44.497
Why care about anything?
Or anyone.

12:44.531 --> 12:45.632
I'm out of here.

12:45.665 --> 12:47.300
What?
Y2K!

12:47.334 --> 12:48.601
Y2K!

12:52.806 --> 12:55.508
If Eddie misses this meeting
and winds up at a Tier 3 school,

12:55.542 --> 12:57.477
it's all your fault.
My fault?

12:57.510 --> 12:59.980
You corrupted him
with all my old escapades,

13:00.013 --> 13:01.949
which I never
wanted him to hear.

13:01.982 --> 13:03.416
He took it
as free license

13:03.450 --> 13:05.986
to ditch us
and run wild.

13:06.019 --> 13:07.620
Exactly what I feared.

13:07.654 --> 13:09.356
Or I inspired him
to explore this campus

13:09.389 --> 13:10.690
and all
it has to offer.

13:10.723 --> 13:13.460
Hey, what's up?
And still show up
right on time.

13:13.493 --> 13:16.696
Eddie, I'm sorry you had to
listen to those nonsense stories

13:16.729 --> 13:18.165
your dad told
the tour group.

13:18.198 --> 13:19.499
Stories?
What stories?

13:19.532 --> 13:21.201
The ones
about your mother?

13:21.234 --> 13:23.170
Nah, I must've bailed
before that.

13:23.203 --> 13:25.873
And yet he still made it
to his big meeting.

13:25.906 --> 13:28.308
Because Eddie knows
that college is important

13:28.341 --> 13:30.010
and he must
take it seriously.

13:30.043 --> 13:32.045
Yeah, I was thinking
about that,

13:32.079 --> 13:34.481
and I don't wanna
go to college.

13:34.514 --> 13:35.548
College sucks.

13:42.622 --> 13:43.156
"College sucks"?!
Eddie!

13:44.524 --> 13:45.859
Sorry.
Not just this one.

13:45.893 --> 13:46.994
All colleges.

13:47.027 --> 13:51.198
As Dean of Admissions,
I am disappointed.

13:51.231 --> 13:55.202
But as a man who thinks
he may have left the oven on...

13:55.235 --> 13:56.870
I'm thrilled.

13:56.904 --> 13:58.238
Seems like
a nice guy.

13:58.271 --> 13:59.973
You had
Kareem's recommendation.

14:00.007 --> 14:01.474
His sky hook
of approval!

14:01.508 --> 14:03.576
All you had to do
was come in and smile.

14:05.412 --> 14:07.380
I can't
smell anything.

14:07.414 --> 14:10.750
I'm so angry,
I've lost my ability to smell.

14:11.952 --> 14:13.553
You guys
should be thanking me.

14:13.586 --> 14:15.488
Now you don't have to
waste your money

14:15.522 --> 14:17.590
sending me
somewhere I hate.

14:17.624 --> 14:18.591
Nothing.

14:18.625 --> 14:19.759
It's like
all my powers

14:19.792 --> 14:21.328
have been drained
to fuel my rage.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.330
Where have you been?
That tour
was so boring.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.831
I had to find
something else to do.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.166
You went
to that party.

14:26.199 --> 14:27.767
That's how
this all happened.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.436
He went there,
he got drunk,

14:29.469 --> 14:31.905
he lost his potential,
and now he hates college.

14:31.939 --> 14:34.241
No, I went and found Justin.
He's my age.

14:34.274 --> 14:36.576
I figured he might show me
how to have fun around here.

14:37.810 --> 14:40.280
Another "Mr. Show"?

14:40.313 --> 14:41.881
Seriously?

14:41.915 --> 14:43.883
We've been watching TV
for hours.

14:43.917 --> 14:46.619
Isn't there anything else
you guys do?

14:46.653 --> 14:48.788
We can all
take a nap again.

14:50.423 --> 14:52.559
I thought that's
what you wanted.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.394
Nice and easy,
sit around.

14:54.427 --> 14:55.795
Recharge
from high school.

14:55.828 --> 14:57.230
Yeah, it sounded good
in theory,

14:57.264 --> 14:59.066
but that's all
they do here.

14:59.099 --> 15:00.633
Turns out
I need a little more.

15:00.667 --> 15:04.304
I haven't seen one thing here
that doesn't suck.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.073
I'm sorry.
College isn't for me.

15:06.106 --> 15:07.207
It's lame.

15:09.476 --> 15:10.743
This is a disaster.

15:10.777 --> 15:13.546
He went from Tier 3 schools
to no schools at all.

15:13.580 --> 15:14.547
He's going
backwards.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.049
Well,
it's now or never.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.384
If you're not
going to show our son

15:17.417 --> 15:19.219
how to have a good time here,
then I will.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.387
You?

15:20.420 --> 15:21.754
What are you gonna do,

15:21.788 --> 15:23.156
throw a Frisbee with him
on the quad?

15:23.190 --> 15:25.458
You don't throw a Frisbee,
you slang it.

15:25.492 --> 15:27.894
Louis,
who are we kidding?

15:27.927 --> 15:30.630
I let you play it up
in front of the kids,

15:30.663 --> 15:32.565
but we both know
that in college,

15:32.599 --> 15:34.001
you were a dork.

15:34.034 --> 15:35.902
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
that's why Eddie needs you.

15:35.935 --> 15:36.970
He is you.

15:37.004 --> 15:38.138
No, Evan's me.

15:38.171 --> 15:41.341
Responsible, focused,
able to pull off argyle.

15:41.374 --> 15:42.342
Argyle!

15:42.375 --> 15:43.410
Evan is you now.

15:43.443 --> 15:44.811
Eddie is
who you used to be.

15:44.844 --> 15:46.579
I could handle myself.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.615
I knew
where to draw the line.

15:48.648 --> 15:49.616
Eddie's not me.

15:49.649 --> 15:50.783
No, he's not.

15:50.817 --> 15:52.652
He's way better off
because you raised him.

15:52.685 --> 15:54.921
Mistakes, regret, loss,

15:54.954 --> 15:57.024
this is the place to start
to learn about that stuff.

15:57.057 --> 15:58.591
And it'll only
help our kids to know

15:58.625 --> 15:59.859
that we
went through it, too.

15:59.892 --> 16:02.029
And we survived
and evolved.

16:02.062 --> 16:03.263
Same way he will.

16:04.531 --> 16:06.799
Look, Jessica, someone needs
to show Eddie

16:06.833 --> 16:08.635
that college
can be challenging

16:08.668 --> 16:10.270
and soul-searching
and fun.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.671
And that person
is you.

16:11.704 --> 16:12.672
The old you.

16:12.705 --> 16:14.641
Messy Jessie.

16:14.674 --> 16:16.143
What do you say,
gunslinger?

16:18.911 --> 16:21.148
...probably a huge tadpole
by now.

16:21.181 --> 16:22.515
Man:
Nice, right?

16:22.549 --> 16:24.284
Wah-wah.

16:28.255 --> 16:30.057
* Got the wind in my hair
Arnold got his start here.

16:30.090 --> 16:32.159
What are your
political aspirations?

16:33.060 --> 16:34.461
Which exercise

16:34.494 --> 16:35.562
best preps
a young candidate

16:35.595 --> 16:36.663
for the campaign trail?

16:37.764 --> 16:39.366
How do you square
the Electoral College

16:39.399 --> 16:40.667
with "1 Person, 1 Vote"?

16:42.502 --> 16:44.037
* Since I was just a girl

16:44.071 --> 16:46.473
* I've traveled near and far

16:46.506 --> 16:49.576
Man: Alright, I know you heard
this scene 15 times or so.

16:49.609 --> 16:51.844
But they're gonna run it
once more,

16:51.878 --> 16:53.746
so they need you
to act like

16:53.780 --> 16:56.816
this is the first time
you're hearing these jokes!

16:56.849 --> 16:58.351
All right?
Energy up.

16:59.419 --> 17:00.820
Oh,
this is nothing.

17:00.853 --> 17:04.357
When Kelsey Grammer's
having a day, look out.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.160
You sure
you can eat ramen dry?

17:07.194 --> 17:09.529
You can eat anything dry
if you chew enough.

17:12.765 --> 17:15.034
Eddie, I have to
tell you something.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.837
I am Messy Jessie.

17:17.870 --> 17:18.771
Who?

17:18.805 --> 17:20.173
When I was in college,

17:20.207 --> 17:22.109
I didn't
take it seriously.

17:23.210 --> 17:25.011
I used to be
a madwoman.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.614
I don't believe this.
What?

17:27.647 --> 17:29.216
That you could fill
a water balloon

17:29.249 --> 17:30.517
with shaving cream
instead of water

17:30.550 --> 17:31.751
so you could actually
lift it?

17:31.784 --> 17:34.121
No, I mean, yes, that is also
pretty mind-blowing,

17:34.154 --> 17:36.623
but I'm talking about
how you were wild in college.

17:36.656 --> 17:39.459
Occasionally,
I would let my hair down.

17:39.492 --> 17:41.294
Until I shaved it all off
on a dare.

17:41.328 --> 17:43.130
How come you never
told me all this?

17:43.163 --> 17:45.898
Because there are some qualities
you see in your kids

17:45.932 --> 17:49.202
that you know they got from you,
and you are not proud.

17:49.236 --> 17:50.237
So...

17:50.270 --> 17:51.971
you're ashamed
I like to have fun?

17:52.004 --> 17:53.873
No,
it's not that.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.575
It's just that maybe

17:55.608 --> 17:58.044
if I had been more focused
the first time around,

17:58.077 --> 17:59.546
I wouldn't be
back in school now

17:59.579 --> 18:01.080
trying to do it
all over again.

18:01.114 --> 18:02.815
I don't want you
to have to do that.

18:02.849 --> 18:04.083
Really?

18:04.117 --> 18:05.285
Because it seems to me
that the way you did it

18:05.318 --> 18:06.319
is way more interesting.

18:06.353 --> 18:08.755
You lived it up,
you had a family,

18:08.788 --> 18:11.624
multiple careers,
still pushing yourself --

18:11.658 --> 18:13.059
Okay, you're right,
I don't regret it.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.761
I just don't want
to encourage you

18:14.794 --> 18:16.095
to behave
the way I did.

18:16.129 --> 18:17.830
I know,
I'm a hypocrite.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.232
No, cocky.

18:19.266 --> 18:21.134
You think you're the only person
who could handle anything?

18:21.168 --> 18:22.135
Yes.

18:22.169 --> 18:23.570
Because I am
battle-tested.

18:23.603 --> 18:24.837
Not as much as me.

18:24.871 --> 18:27.674
You could never handle
what I went through -- you.

18:28.541 --> 18:31.077
Me versus me.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.480
That is interesting.
Who would win?

18:33.513 --> 18:34.481
Me.

18:34.514 --> 18:35.515
You're crazy.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.185
You call it
like you see it.

18:38.218 --> 18:40.920
That is another quality
I am proud you get from me.

18:40.953 --> 18:44.524
Well, I am glad
that Messy Jessie could help.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.626
Now,
are you gonna tell me

18:46.659 --> 18:48.261
what we're gonna do
with this cream balloon?

18:48.295 --> 18:49.362
Yes.

18:49.396 --> 18:53.132
As long as you promise
to only do it at Harvard.

18:53.166 --> 18:54.534
I don't know
about Harvard,

18:54.567 --> 18:57.437
but maybe college
isn't as lame as I thought.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.472
Okay. Stanford.

18:59.506 --> 19:00.607
Ready?

19:00.640 --> 19:02.041
Evan:
Hey, look!

19:02.074 --> 19:03.776
It's our little
movie star!

19:03.810 --> 19:06.145
You make it big?

19:06.179 --> 19:08.114
No.
Hollywood sucks.

19:08.147 --> 19:10.217
Yeah, turns out
a beachside gym

19:10.250 --> 19:12.719
isn't the political think tank
you would expect.

19:12.752 --> 19:14.221
And look at this.

19:14.254 --> 19:15.888
Completely pumped out.

19:15.922 --> 19:18.825
I won't be able to do
bis and tris till next week!

19:18.858 --> 19:20.026
I thought being rich

19:20.059 --> 19:21.794
and not caring about anything
would be amazing.

19:21.828 --> 19:24.130
Garfield makes it look
so easy.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.632
Garfield's not rich.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.900
He's cat-rich.
It's different.

19:27.934 --> 19:29.336
It was all too much.

19:29.369 --> 19:31.738
The excess,
ignoring consequences,

19:31.771 --> 19:33.039
never saying no.

19:33.072 --> 19:35.242
It's unsustainable.
You can't live life that way.

19:35.275 --> 19:37.677
No one can.
Not even me.

19:37.710 --> 19:39.646
Not even Danny DeVito.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.648
Grandma,
that wasn't Danny DeVito.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.983
Emery, they could've kissed.
Let her have it.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.151
* Yeah

19:45.184 --> 19:47.220
You know,
even if Y2K's coming,

19:47.254 --> 19:49.656
I'd rather spend
my last few days with you two,

19:49.689 --> 19:50.923
just like we always do --

19:50.957 --> 19:53.059
on the couch,
busting each other's yams.

19:54.794 --> 19:56.563
Hey, if the world
doesn't end,

19:56.596 --> 19:59.699
how are we gonna pay off
our credit cards?

19:59.732 --> 20:01.734
I faked
my death before.

20:01.768 --> 20:03.370
I can do it again.

20:03.403 --> 20:04.937
Hmm.

20:07.640 --> 20:10.277
Look out below!

20:10.310 --> 20:11.711
Nooooooo!

20:14.814 --> 20:16.283
Messy Jessie!

20:21.788 --> 20:22.522
If you were this crazy
in college,

20:23.790 --> 20:24.957
I can't imagine what
"The Buffalo" was like.

20:24.991 --> 20:26.459
Nope. Sorry.
That's R-rated.

20:26.493 --> 20:27.860
Louis,
I thought you said

20:27.894 --> 20:30.630
good parenting was sharing
our past, not hiding it.

20:30.663 --> 20:32.799
Oh, I say a lot of things
to get out of the doghouse.

20:32.832 --> 20:34.301
Your dad
was a club guy.

20:34.334 --> 20:35.468
He joined them all.

20:36.836 --> 20:38.438
I am so excited.

20:38.471 --> 20:39.806
Topiary Club!

20:39.839 --> 20:41.641
Or should we call it
Shrub Club?

20:42.675 --> 20:44.076
Look out, nerds!

20:44.110 --> 20:46.446
Coming through!

20:47.580 --> 20:48.715
Are you here
for the club?

20:49.816 --> 20:51.451
Extracurriculars
are the wings

20:51.484 --> 20:52.719
of a social butterfly.

20:52.752 --> 20:53.786
Dad,
you're making it worse.

20:53.820 --> 20:55.221
Oh, yeah?
I had a ton of sex.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.889
No,
you did not.
I did, too.

20:56.923 --> 20:58.224
With who?
The bush club?

20:58.257 --> 20:59.225
The Shrub Club!

20:59.258 --> 21:00.960
Okay.
That's enough sharing.
