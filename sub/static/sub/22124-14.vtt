08:52.401 --> 08:53.533
let'’s pursue
both scenarios.

08:53.576 --> 08:56.231
Brothers can'’t be trusted,
Detective.

08:56.274 --> 09:00.061
You'’re just delaying
her inevitable disappointment.

09:01.149 --> 09:02.106
Maybe.

09:02.150 --> 09:05.893
Maybe not.

09:12.508 --> 09:13.770
I'’ve been through some...

09:13.814 --> 09:15.467
[sighs]
trauma.

09:15.511 --> 09:17.469
And I'’ve been avoiding it.
[chuckles]

09:17.513 --> 09:20.385
But, recently, um,
events have caused me to realize

09:20.429 --> 09:21.909
that I need to...

09:21.952 --> 09:24.041
face my fears.

09:24.085 --> 09:27.262
Lucifer mentioned that
you worked wonders with him.

09:27.305 --> 09:30.265
I mean, you see someone
who calls himself the Devil.

09:30.308 --> 09:33.616
So anything I say can'’t sound
too crazy, right? [chuckles]

09:36.837 --> 09:38.882
I haven'’t been
to therapy before.

09:38.926 --> 09:41.624
Is this where I start...

09:41.668 --> 09:43.452
telling you
what I'’m going through?

09:43.495 --> 09:45.976
Um...

09:46.020 --> 09:47.238
a couple of months ago,

09:47.282 --> 09:50.981
I had a near-death experience.

09:51.025 --> 09:55.899
And I think that-that
when I was dead, um,

09:55.943 --> 09:57.901
I think that I was in Hell,

09:57.945 --> 09:59.337
reliving the same nightmare...

09:59.381 --> 10:00.730
I can'’t help you.

10:00.774 --> 10:02.166
Excuse me?

10:02.210 --> 10:04.952
You need to leave.

10:04.995 --> 10:06.431
Now.

10:06.475 --> 10:08.433
Oh, I'’m...

10:08.477 --> 10:10.174
Of course. I'’m s...

10:10.218 --> 10:12.437
[chuckles]
I'’m so sorry to have...

10:12.481 --> 10:14.091
to have wasted your time.

10:14.135 --> 10:15.963
[door opens]

10:18.487 --> 10:21.359
I really am beyond help,
aren'’t I?

10:29.324 --> 10:30.281
[door opens]

10:30.325 --> 10:31.631
[sighs]

10:31.674 --> 10:32.936
Brothers.
[chuckles]

10:32.980 --> 10:34.111
Am I right?

10:34.155 --> 10:35.765
I mean, you get it.
You killed yours.

10:35.809 --> 10:37.114
I wish I had that option.

10:37.158 --> 10:38.768
Amenadiel won'’t
help, I take it?

10:38.812 --> 10:40.291
Nope.

10:40.335 --> 10:41.945
No. I mean,
I shouldn'’t be surprised.

10:41.989 --> 10:43.643
Ever since he found out
he'’s Dad's favorite,

10:43.686 --> 10:44.948
he'’s been a bit of a dick.

10:44.992 --> 10:46.646
What do you mean?Well, lots
of chest puffing

10:46.689 --> 10:48.299
and peacocking.

10:48.343 --> 10:51.694
I mean, even more than usual,
with that insufferably smug...

10:51.738 --> 10:54.479
No, I mean, how do you know
that he'’s God's favorite?

10:54.523 --> 10:56.568
It'’s a long story,
involving a flaming sword

10:56.612 --> 10:58.222
and a space vagina.

10:58.266 --> 10:59.397
But the quick version:

10:59.441 --> 11:01.486
a book said it,
so it must be true.

11:01.530 --> 11:04.011
Anyway, not to worry.

11:04.054 --> 11:06.622
I'’ll find a way
to bring him round.

11:11.061 --> 11:13.498
Our victim'’s Fahrid Nasser--
he'’s an international
diamond salesman.

11:13.542 --> 11:15.326
So it makes sense that
you'’d find a loose diamond

11:15.370 --> 11:18.155
in his office, but can you skip
to the part where you help us

11:18.199 --> 11:20.157
track down Ms. Lopez'’s
disappointment of a brother?

11:20.201 --> 11:21.681
I thought we were looking
for another suspect.

11:21.724 --> 11:23.726
We are. Despite
Lucifer'’s attempt

11:23.770 --> 11:26.381
to make this case about what'’s
going on with his own brother.

11:26.424 --> 11:28.165
You were saying, Dan?
Well,

11:28.209 --> 11:30.820
it would make sense to find
a diamond in a broker'’s office,

11:30.864 --> 11:32.343
unless that diamond
was reported stolen.

11:32.387 --> 11:33.518
Fortunately for us,

11:33.562 --> 11:35.520
diamonds are
pretty easy to track.

11:35.564 --> 11:37.609
Each one of them has
a serial number

11:37.653 --> 11:39.524
laser-etched into it.

11:39.568 --> 11:42.745
I usually get them to add crude
drawings to the back of mine.

11:42.789 --> 11:45.008
Where was it stolen from?A diamond boutique

11:45.052 --> 11:46.270
in Beverly Hills.

11:46.314 --> 11:47.837
Here'’s the kicker--
Fahrid, our victim,

11:47.881 --> 11:50.013
he'’s one of the store's
diamond brokers.So, what,

11:50.057 --> 11:51.841
he sells to them,
uses that as a cover

11:51.885 --> 11:53.756
to the case the joint,
then robs it?
Maybe.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.192
File on the robbery'’s
pretty thin--

11:55.236 --> 11:57.194
no security cameras,
no witnesses,

11:57.238 --> 11:59.196
not a lot to go on.All right,

11:59.240 --> 12:00.850
well, maybe Fahrid
had an accomplice?

12:00.894 --> 12:02.373
That could be our
other suspect.

12:02.417 --> 12:04.898
Let'’s go to the jewelry store,
see if we can drum up

12:04.941 --> 12:07.639
any new leads now that we
know Fahrid is involved.

someone other than me

12:24.134 --> 12:25.657
played on the world.

12:25.701 --> 12:27.572
Thousands of dollars

12:27.616 --> 12:28.791
Incredible.

12:28.835 --> 12:31.402
Ah. Hello there.
We'’re here to...

12:31.446 --> 12:33.665
We'’re here to...

12:33.709 --> 12:34.666

12:34.710 --> 12:36.277
[giggles]We are?

12:36.320 --> 12:39.236
Yes. Yeah, he was
gonna surprise me.

12:39.280 --> 12:40.934
But I knew what
he was up to.

Oh.

12:49.943 --> 12:51.422
Mm.

12:51.466 --> 12:54.077
Sweetie, I-I don'’t know
if we came to the right place.

12:54.121 --> 12:56.427
I expect a, a much...

12:56.471 --> 13:00.257
higher clarity,
and-and the color here is blech.

13:00.301 --> 13:01.955
Oh, I see you have
quite a discerning eye.

13:01.998 --> 13:04.914
I have some
other wonderful options.

13:04.958 --> 13:06.786
Just a moment.Thank you.

13:07.961 --> 13:10.615
I... am confused.

13:10.659 --> 13:12.966
The file said that there was
no security footage.

13:13.009 --> 13:15.707
All these cameras,
they'’re not new, which means

13:15.751 --> 13:18.101
they were here at the time
of the robbery, which means

13:18.145 --> 13:19.973
this is probably
an inside job.

13:20.016 --> 13:22.802
Yeah, I got that part--
flush out the accomplice,
et cetera, et cetera.

13:22.845 --> 13:25.021
No, how do you know
so much about diamonds?

13:25.065 --> 13:27.023
Well, I'’ve watched
enough Real Housewives

13:27.067 --> 13:28.851
to fake it with

13:28.895 --> 13:30.722

Oh. Wonderful.

13:30.766 --> 13:32.463
Really?

13:32.507 --> 13:35.118
[laughs]:
No. No.

13:35.162 --> 13:36.772
These still
won'’t do.

How about this-- why don'’t
I show you what I don'’t want?

13:43.431 --> 13:45.346
I didn'’t know that
my future husband

13:45.389 --> 13:46.651
was that cheap.

13:46.695 --> 13:48.697
I am not cheap.

13:50.438 --> 13:53.180
That diamond is
of the highest quality.

13:53.223 --> 13:55.530
Is it? Is it of the
highest quality?

13:55.573 --> 13:56.748
Mm-hmm.Let'’s see.

13:56.792 --> 13:58.576

Oh.

14:01.231 --> 14:04.495
Uh-huh, excellent color, and...

14:04.539 --> 14:05.322
And what?

14:05.366 --> 14:07.498
Uh, I'’m sorry, uh...

14:07.542 --> 14:09.413
I recognize
the serial number.

14:09.457 --> 14:12.503
But, uh, this diamond is...

14:12.547 --> 14:13.983
stolen.

14:14.027 --> 14:15.506
No.Stolen?

I am not cheap.

14:21.208 --> 14:23.166

to call the police.Oh, yes,

14:23.210 --> 14:24.689
please, please

14:24.733 --> 14:25.995

No need to get
the authorities involved.

14:34.917 --> 14:36.788
I'’m Tiffany James,
the owner.

14:36.832 --> 14:38.878
Why don'’t you come with me,

14:38.921 --> 14:41.576
and we'’ll find you
the perfect diamond.

14:44.840 --> 14:48.713
So, tell me exactly
what it is you'’re looking for.

14:48.757 --> 14:50.628
It'’s funny,
Ms. James,

14:50.672 --> 14:53.283
I was waiting for a clerk
to make a run for it,

14:53.327 --> 14:55.720
or a security guard
to start sweating.

14:55.764 --> 14:57.722
But the owner
of the store...

14:57.766 --> 14:58.810
Excuse me?

14:58.854 --> 15:00.464
Why rob your own store?

15:00.508 --> 15:01.770
[laughs]

15:01.813 --> 15:04.294
I don'’t know what
you'’re talking about.

15:04.338 --> 15:06.906
I'’m LAPD.And I'’m notcheap,
for the record.

15:06.949 --> 15:09.386
But let'’s cut to the chase,
shall we, Tiffany?

15:09.430 --> 15:11.649
How did you help Jay Lopez
steal diamonds

15:11.693 --> 15:14.130
and murder Fahrid Nasser?

15:14.174 --> 15:16.567
Who'’s Jay Lopez? Wait.

15:16.611 --> 15:18.047
Fahrid'’s dead?

15:18.091 --> 15:19.657
Stop prompting the witness.

15:19.701 --> 15:22.051
Fine. But the sooner we prove
Ms. Lopez'’s elder brother

15:22.095 --> 15:24.749
is a liar and a disappointment,
the better.

15:24.793 --> 15:27.143
Would you excuse us
for a second?

15:27.187 --> 15:29.493
Thank you.
[sighs]

15:29.537 --> 15:31.060
It'’s obvious that
you'’re having

15:31.104 --> 15:33.236
some kind of fight
with Amenadiel,

15:33.280 --> 15:36.239
but right now you need
to focus on the case.

15:36.283 --> 15:39.764
Fine.And for the record...

15:39.808 --> 15:42.767
I wish I had a brother
to fight with.

15:42.811 --> 15:44.247
But...

15:44.291 --> 15:46.336
So, you admit to
knowing Fahrid.

15:46.380 --> 15:48.599
Of course--
he sold diamonds here.

15:48.643 --> 15:50.601
Wow, I can'’t believe
he'’s really dead.

15:50.645 --> 15:53.430
Oh, a complete shock to you and
all your associates, I'’m sure.

15:53.474 --> 15:55.258
So let'’s get on with it,
shall we?

15:55.302 --> 15:57.086
Tell me...

15:57.130 --> 15:58.522
Tiffany,

15:58.566 --> 16:02.352
what is it you desire?

16:02.396 --> 16:06.269
To punch every millennial
in the face.

16:06.313 --> 16:08.706
Really?
[chuckles]

16:08.750 --> 16:09.707
I mean, I
don'’t disagree,

16:09.751 --> 16:11.796
but still.

16:11.840 --> 16:14.277
They'’ve ruined
our entire industry.

16:14.321 --> 16:17.280
With their social
consciousness and
ethical issues.

16:17.324 --> 16:19.021
Sales are way down
because of them.

16:19.065 --> 16:21.981
Do you know how hard it is
to stay afloat?So hard

16:22.024 --> 16:24.113
that you have to rob
your own store?No one was supposed

16:24.157 --> 16:25.985
to get hurt.

16:26.028 --> 16:29.118
We just wanted
the insurance money.

16:29.162 --> 16:31.729
[chuckles] This was
an insurance scam?

16:31.773 --> 16:34.297
Then why kill Fahrid?I didn'’t.

16:34.341 --> 16:36.299
Fahrid was supposed to sell
the diamonds back to us

16:36.343 --> 16:38.127
after he cleaned them, but...

16:38.171 --> 16:40.303
now...

16:40.347 --> 16:43.524
Well, I mean,
if anyone is cheap...

16:43.567 --> 16:45.613
it'’s her.

16:50.531 --> 16:52.185
Oh, why are we here?

16:52.228 --> 16:54.665
Jay would never, ever stay
in a place like this.

16:54.709 --> 16:56.667
Two days ago, he
used his debit card

16:56.711 --> 16:58.669
at a gas station
around the corner.

16:58.713 --> 17:01.020
So? Dude wanted a Slurpee--
it doesn'’t mean anything.

17:01.063 --> 17:02.673
You don'’t come into
this neighborhood

17:02.717 --> 17:04.327
unless you have a reason--
and if you'’re here

17:04.371 --> 17:07.591
to do criminal activity, you
come to a hotel that takes cash.

17:07.635 --> 17:09.332
He is not a criminal.Yeah.

17:09.376 --> 17:11.247
You'’ve... never seen

17:11.291 --> 17:13.684
this guy, right?

17:13.728 --> 17:15.512
Have you seen him?

17:15.556 --> 17:17.601
Unless you got a warrant,

17:17.645 --> 17:20.169
I ain'’t answering
either of you.

17:20.213 --> 17:20.909
Aah! Aah!

17:22.084 --> 17:24.173
I'’m gonna give you two choices.

17:24.217 --> 17:25.348
I can either
break your arm...

17:25.392 --> 17:26.697
[grunts in pain]

17:26.741 --> 17:29.352
...or I can cut your...

17:29.396 --> 17:30.875
Maze! Just...

17:30.919 --> 17:33.182
Do you have

17:33.226 --> 17:34.792
a brother, sister,

17:34.836 --> 17:38.361
anyone who you care about,
who it would just kill you

17:38.405 --> 17:40.972
if you didn'’t know
where they were,
if they were safe?

17:41.016 --> 17:43.062
Threatening his family?

17:43.105 --> 17:44.237
Hard-core, Ellen.

17:44.280 --> 17:47.544
Ten bucks an hour
ain'’t worth this.

17:47.588 --> 17:48.806

exactly what happened.

in the bathroom

27:41.834 --> 27:43.705
when I heard
the gunshots.

27:43.749 --> 27:45.533
Then I stayed quiet.

27:45.576 --> 27:48.492
After I saw the gunman
leave, I came out.Whoa, whoa, wait.

27:48.536 --> 27:49.842
You saw the shooter?

27:49.885 --> 27:51.539
Yeah, I peeked
out from the door

27:51.582 --> 27:53.193
and saw him standing
over Fahrid.

27:53.236 --> 27:55.325
Jay, if you saw him,
you can identify him.

27:55.369 --> 27:57.719
He wore all black
and a ski mask.

27:57.763 --> 27:59.199
I-I didn'’t get a

There has to be something
that you remember.

red wingtip shoes.

Jay, the... door opens outward.

28:23.266 --> 28:24.746
So?

28:24.790 --> 28:28.707
So... Jay,
from your vantage point inside,

28:28.750 --> 28:30.447
it would have been impossible

28:30.491 --> 28:32.885
for you to see the killer
standing over the body.

28:32.928 --> 28:34.190
Look, I saw what I saw.

28:34.234 --> 28:35.844
Where'’s the stash room?

28:35.888 --> 28:37.237
If Fahrid is
a diamond thief,

28:37.280 --> 28:38.542
he'’d definitely have
a stash room.

28:38.586 --> 28:40.370
And if I were him,

28:40.414 --> 28:42.416
I would hide it right...

He'’s the insurance adjuster
for the missing diamonds.

29:19.801 --> 29:21.803
He said that equipment replaces
the serial number

Okay, fine.

to stick your hand in
the proverbial cookie jar

39:49.256 --> 39:50.866
because it
"took care of your family"?

39:50.910 --> 39:53.086
It started small.

39:53.129 --> 39:55.044
I had to bail a brother out.

39:55.088 --> 39:56.698

all came to.

ease the pain.

would hurt her.
