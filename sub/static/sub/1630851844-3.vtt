00:43.835 --> 00:45.546
Scratch, I need your help

00:45.546 --> 00:47.965
with the most important
question of my life!

00:47.965 --> 00:49.675
Who will be my best friend?!

00:49.675 --> 00:51.927
And don't be offended.
You'll always be my number one.

00:51.927 --> 00:54.388
I'm cursed with you.
We are not friends.

00:54.388 --> 00:57.391
But I need a human bestie!
You know, for human stuff.

00:57.391 --> 00:59.434
Physically impossible
for me to care less.

00:59.434 --> 01:02.688
So, I've narrowed it down
to three amazing candidates.

01:02.688 --> 01:05.732
Libby... Sheela...

01:05.732 --> 01:07.901
‐and Kat.
‐[cat meows]

01:07.901 --> 01:09.987
And, you know, they're all
so different on paper.

01:09.987 --> 01:11.113
But guess what they have
in common.

01:11.113 --> 01:12.573
I don't care
about any of them?

01:12.573 --> 01:14.116
They're all Wilder Scouts!

01:14.116 --> 01:16.201
And we're going
camping tonight!

01:16.201 --> 01:19.329
Four strong female
trailblazers in the wilderness.

01:19.329 --> 01:21.582
This is how you make
lifelong friends, Scratch!

01:21.582 --> 01:24.167
We'll probably sit
together at lunch,
then be roommates in college,

01:24.167 --> 01:26.461
run for political office
on a shared platform.

01:26.461 --> 01:28.964
I mean, we're basically
choosing a future leader
of our nation here!

01:28.964 --> 01:31.341
Camping? No, not happening.

01:31.341 --> 01:33.677
Besides, why are you
so obsessed with this
friend thing anyway?

01:33.677 --> 01:36.054
‐I don't have
a best friend and I'm‐‐
‐Scratch!

01:36.054 --> 01:39.391
Oh, my best friend of friends!

01:39.391 --> 01:42.936
‐You were saying...?
‐This guy? Ah, no, no.

01:42.936 --> 01:45.814
He's not a friend. He's more
like an annoying coworker.

01:45.814 --> 01:47.482
Hi. I'm Geoff.

01:47.482 --> 01:50.152
‐G‐E‐O‐F‐F.
‐Nobody's spelling it, Geoff.

01:50.152 --> 01:52.321
‐Not to be confused with Jeff.
‐Ahh!

01:52.321 --> 01:55.282
‐J‐E‐F‐F.
‐No one's writing this down.

01:55.282 --> 01:58.201
‐What are you even doing here?
‐You promised we'd hang! Today!

01:58.201 --> 02:00.120
The second Saturday
after "Never".

02:01.997 --> 02:04.082
Seems doctored.

02:05.334 --> 02:07.377
OK, whatever. Listen,
I gotta rescheduled anyway,

02:07.377 --> 02:09.546
'cause I got a lotta balls
in the air right now.

02:09.546 --> 02:11.923
Scratch! That's no way
to treat your best friend.

02:11.923 --> 02:14.801
Geoff, come camping with us.
We're gonna roast marshmallows,

02:14.801 --> 02:17.554
learn about nature,
tell scary stories.

02:17.554 --> 02:19.681
Ooh! What kind of scary
we're talking about here?

02:19.681 --> 02:21.475
Uh, so scary!

02:21.475 --> 02:24.686
'Cause we got bugs,
fire, wolves, bears and...

02:24.686 --> 02:26.980
‐Keep talking.
‐Pit toilets!

02:26.980 --> 02:29.775
Hm... I could really pad
this month's scare report.

02:29.775 --> 02:32.402
Oh, wow, that sounds like fun!

02:32.402 --> 02:35.197
You're not invited.

02:35.197 --> 02:37.324
Riiight. [winks]

02:37.324 --> 02:39.451
Ugh, could be a long weekend.

02:42.537 --> 02:43.288
[tweeting]

02:47.125 --> 02:50.754
All right, ladies.
Go get your camping badge
or whatever we're doin' here.

02:50.754 --> 02:54.257
So, does anyone know anything
about setting up a campsite?

02:54.257 --> 02:56.718
Or maybe, uh,
lifelong friendship?

02:56.718 --> 02:59.346
Not me. I'm only here
because my mom said

02:59.346 --> 03:02.391
exposure to fresh air
and other kids my age
would help me.

03:02.391 --> 03:04.309
‐[gulps, coughs]
‐[gasps]

03:04.309 --> 03:05.852
I'm good.

03:05.852 --> 03:08.772
The key to a cozy campfire
is location.

03:08.772 --> 03:11.191
I think we should
set camp... here.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.859
[claps] We're losing daylight!

03:12.859 --> 03:16.029
Kat, you find the flint.
Molly, you gather firewood.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.698
‐And Libby‐‐
‐Ahh!

03:17.698 --> 03:18.699
Stay upright.

[Scratch chewing]

03:21.910 --> 03:24.246
Scratch!
You can't eat those berries,
they're poisonous!

03:24.246 --> 03:26.540
You know I'm
already dead, right?

03:26.540 --> 03:29.251
‐Oh. Right.
‐So how's the friend
hunt going?

03:29.251 --> 03:32.587
Not bad! These score cards have
everything I'm looking for
in a best friend.

03:32.587 --> 03:35.424
Creativity, smarts, generosity,

03:35.424 --> 03:38.009
a deep passion
for fuzzy socks, leadership

03:38.009 --> 03:40.429
and, most importantly...
the X‐factor.

03:40.429 --> 03:43.432
Wow! Oh, that's pretty‐‐ Oh,
you know what, I don't care.

03:43.432 --> 03:45.225
I totally won't be
scaring you guys later,

03:45.225 --> 03:47.519
so don't suspect
anything, OK? Bye.

03:47.519 --> 03:49.771
Wait! Don't you wanna know
what the X‐factor is?

03:49.771 --> 03:51.815

interested in sharing stories

that, I don't know,
highlight their best qualities?

A story? I've got a story.

05:35.126 --> 05:37.295
OK. Uh, let's hear it, Libby.

05:37.295 --> 05:42.342
This is the haunting tale
of Howlin' Harriet.

05:42.342 --> 05:46.388
Many, many years ago,
there was a bloodthirsty
criminal named Harriet.

05:46.388 --> 05:48.431
[Sheela]
What was her crime?

05:48.431 --> 05:51.560
[Libby]
She sold uncured salami
on a Wednesday.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.603
‐Uh... what?
‐Laws were different back then.

05:53.603 --> 05:55.939
‐Oh...
‐[Libby] Harriet was
chased out of town

05:55.939 --> 05:58.525
by the angry citizens
of Brighton.

05:58.525 --> 06:01.027
As she was running,
she tripped on the tracks

06:01.027 --> 06:03.822
and fell in the way
of an oncoming train!

06:03.822 --> 06:06.116
‐[train honks]
‐[Libby] Blam!

06:06.116 --> 06:11.413
And all the folk
of Brighton found
were her mangled toes.

06:11.413 --> 06:14.457
And now, on nights like tonight
when the moon is full,

06:14.457 --> 06:16.626
her ghost roams
these very woods,

06:16.626 --> 06:20.297
howling in pain,
looking for toes
of unsuspecting campers

06:20.297 --> 06:22.215
to replace the ones she lost!

06:22.215 --> 06:24.217
‐[howls]
‐[Sheela and Kat scream]

06:24.217 --> 06:26.970
Pretty good! I was kind
of hoping for a happy ending

06:26.970 --> 06:28.638
where Harriet befriended
lonely campers.

06:28.638 --> 06:30.390
Y'know, flip the script
on ghosts or whatever.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.433
But scary's good too...

06:31.433 --> 06:34.227
[crickets chirping]

06:34.227 --> 06:36.605
Scratch, brainstorm!

06:36.605 --> 06:39.983
What if you dress up
as Howlin' Harriet
to scare the campers?

06:39.983 --> 06:42.027
Yeah, you know what,
that's great thinking.

06:42.027 --> 06:44.613
Whoa! Wait a minute. Lightbulb.
Why don't you go away

06:44.613 --> 06:47.157
and dress up
like Howlin' Harriet?

06:47.157 --> 06:50.035
And then run in if I need you.
I'll give you
a special buddy signal.

06:50.035 --> 06:53.413
A mission! OK! Stay calm,
stay calm, stay calm,
Geoff... with a G.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.624
OK! I won't let
you down, Scratch!

‐[screams]
‐Oh, man. That's a great
a‐buffoon, I'll tell you what.

06:59.044 --> 07:01.546
Dressing up as Harriet
is not gonna scare anybody.

07:01.546 --> 07:04.049
What kind of idiot would
believe she's real anyway?

07:04.049 --> 07:05.383
Oh, I'm tickling myself.

07:11.890 --> 07:14.643
Make sure to keep your toes
in your sleeping bags!

07:14.643 --> 07:18.021
Wouldn't want
Howlin' Harriet to get them!

07:18.021 --> 07:20.774
Think these socks are
thick enough to protect me
from Howlin' Harriet?

07:20.774 --> 07:23.902
Ghosts aren't real.
Just a product
of an overactive imagination.

07:25.737 --> 07:28.114
Ha‐ha! Yeah, ghosts.
Totally not real.

07:28.114 --> 07:30.158
Who'd believe that? Not me.
Ha‐ha!

07:30.158 --> 07:32.577
Oh, we... we do laugh.

07:35.372 --> 07:38.708
Ah, yes. I feel
a scare in the air.

07:38.708 --> 07:42.128

And she's coming for our toes!

‐[growls]
‐Scratch, I told you,
you can't scare me off.

07:59.270 --> 08:03.066
Well, I might've been
able to if someone
hadn't stolen my scare!

08:03.066 --> 08:04.859
I'm looking at you, Geoff!

08:04.859 --> 08:06.361
And what is this?
What's with all the sticks?

08:06.361 --> 08:08.196
It's a bit too much, Geoff.

08:08.196 --> 08:10.323
Aw, really, Scratch?
I don't know.

08:10.323 --> 08:13.410
I mean, I think my detail work
really helps sell the illusion.

08:13.410 --> 08:15.370
But if you're...
then this is...

get rid of her?

we give her the thing
she's been looking for?

08:31.720 --> 08:34.639
I like it!
Whose toes are we taking?
The pink haired girl, right?

08:34.639 --> 08:37.183
You and Geoff keep her
away from the campers.
Especially the pink haired one.

OK. Sun's up, let's go.

10:18.201 --> 10:20.370
Wow, I was
so scared last night.

10:20.370 --> 10:22.789
Yeah, I can't believe
we talked ourselves

10:22.789 --> 10:24.833
into believing
Howlin' Harriet was real.

10:24.833 --> 10:28.753
Sure seemed real though, huh?
Kinda wish it was.

10:28.753 --> 10:32.215
You know,
between you and Geoff,
I can't get a minute to myself!

10:32.215 --> 10:36.010
So I sincerely hope
you found a human bestie
so I can have a break.

10:36.010 --> 10:38.596
No one can
replace you, Scratch,
as my number one bestie.

10:38.596 --> 10:40.140
But I think I found a winner!

10:41.599 --> 10:44.644
I just gotta hope she wants
to be my best friend too
[inhales]

10:44.644 --> 10:46.104
Molly, wanna be my best friend?

10:46.104 --> 10:47.897
Whaaa?

10:47.897 --> 10:49.983
I understand
if the answer's no.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.235
I'm not really for everyone.
I'm an acquired‐‐

10:52.235 --> 10:53.695

11:00.493 --> 11:05.081
Well, as long as no one
tells the Ghost Council
about Howlin' Harriet,

11:05.081 --> 11:08.418
I'd say our scare reports
could be pretty good
this month, eh, buddy?

11:08.418 --> 11:10.753
You called me buddy!

11:10.753 --> 11:12.922
What? That was‐‐
No, I didn't mean it!

11:12.922 --> 11:16.217
Oh. I didn't mean it
either... bestie. [winks]

to the Ghost Council it goes!

11:50.210 --> 11:52.212
Now what's going on here?

11:52.212 --> 11:55.089
Nineteen to nothing? Ugh.

11:55.089 --> 11:58.718
‐Is there like, any other team
we can root for?
‐No, Scratch.

11:58.718 --> 12:02.138
All Libby and the Lemmings
need to succeed is
a little encouragement!

12:02.138 --> 12:04.933
And nobody encourages
harder than me.

12:04.933 --> 12:07.101
‐Well, that is true.
‐And once the Lemmings
start winning,

12:07.101 --> 12:09.395
that'll enhappify

‐[knocks]
‐Aw.

12:17.612 --> 12:20.156
Uh... Nope, I can't put
a positive spin on it.
They're terrible.

12:21.741 --> 12:24.994
‐I don't want to play anymore.
‐Why do I even try?

12:24.994 --> 12:27.997
That was some really great
standing in the field, Libby.

12:27.997 --> 12:31.501
It was outstanding,
um, standing.

12:31.501 --> 12:34.087
It's okay, Molly.
We know we're awful.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.673
Thanks for coming though.
It was nice
to hear your cheers.

12:36.673 --> 12:38.508
over all the weeping.

12:38.508 --> 12:40.551
Welp, time to call it
a day, huh?

12:40.551 --> 12:42.971
We should really get going.
I got a nap with my name on it.

12:42.971 --> 12:45.348
The Lemmings don't believe
in themselves, Scratch.

12:45.348 --> 12:46.891
They don't believe
they can be winners.

12:46.891 --> 12:48.685
Well, they believe
correctly, Moll,

12:48.685 --> 12:51.104
because, follow me on this...
They're losers.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.940
Hey, everybody deserves
a chance to succeed.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.734
[gasps] So what if
I joined the Lemmings

12:56.734 --> 12:59.862
and taught them the power
of positive thinking?

12:59.862 --> 13:01.823
A lifetime diet
of animated films

13:01.823 --> 13:04.033
has taught me that as long
as I believe in myself,

13:04.033 --> 13:06.452
I can do anything!

13:06.452 --> 13:08.579
Yeah, OK, but...

13:08.579 --> 13:09.998
have you ever
even played softball?

13:09.998 --> 13:11.874
Me? Play softball?

13:11.874 --> 13:12.667
Is that what you're asking?
Have I ever played it?

13:12.667 --> 13:13.960
‐Yeah.
‐No.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.921
Have I wanted to play it?
Also no.

13:16.921 --> 13:19.799
But am I gonna play it?
Heck to the yes!

‐Oh! Ooh... Sorry!

13:24.637 --> 13:26.764
OK, Lemmings. To win this game,

13:26.764 --> 13:29.392
all we need to do
is believe in ourselves.

18:04.292 --> 18:06.919
I'm cheating
for nothing, Scratch.

18:06.919 --> 18:10.047

They only believe in... me.

‐It's pretty important‐‐

18:58.346 --> 19:02.224
On page three, it says
you scared Billy Palmer.

19:02.224 --> 19:07.271
But then on page five, it says
you terrified a William Palmer.

19:07.271 --> 19:10.650
Are Billy and William
the same person?

19:10.650 --> 19:13.402
‐I don't know. Maybe?
‐They are.

19:13.402 --> 19:16.989

short for the month, Scratch.

this baby wrapped up‐‐

19:27.792 --> 19:29.752
What the hey!

19:29.752 --> 19:31.754
You gave up 17 runs,

19:31.754 --> 19:33.756
and the bases are loaded?

19:33.756 --> 19:36.175
‐How?!
‐I don't know, man.

19:36.175 --> 19:39.679
It's a blur of bats,
and balls, and humiliation.

19:39.679 --> 19:42.390
I knew you'd start losing
sooner or later.

19:42.390 --> 19:45.017
Lucky for you, I'm back.
Now let's just take
this jerk down.

19:45.017 --> 19:47.978
I'm thinking
a fastball up her nose,
you know what I mean.

19:47.978 --> 19:52.024
No, Scratch. I'm gonna
finish this game myself.

19:52.024 --> 19:56.112
What?! No!
We just need one more out!

19:56.112 --> 19:57.780
Think of the Lemmings, Molly!

19:57.780 --> 20:00.199
[crying]

20:00.199 --> 20:01.659
Think of Brighton!

20:01.659 --> 20:03.786

20:03.786 --> 20:06.414
Enhappify them!

20:06.414 --> 20:09.041
I want to enhappify Brighton.

20:09.041 --> 20:12.420
But I did all this
to help the Lemmings
believe in themselves.

20:12.420 --> 20:15.172
Well, now it's time
I believe in the Lemmings.

20:15.172 --> 20:17.341
So, no more cheating!

20:17.341 --> 20:19.301
OK. I mean, it's your loss.
