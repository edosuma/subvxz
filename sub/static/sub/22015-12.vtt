WEBVTT

00:06.340 --> 00:06.507
.

00:06.540 --> 00:07.441
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:08.742 --> 00:10.344
sexually based offenses

00:10.378 --> 00:12.180
are considered
especially heinous.

00:12.213 --> 00:14.248
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.282 --> 00:16.117
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.150 --> 00:17.485
are members of an elite squad

00:17.518 --> 00:19.387
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.420 --> 00:22.623
These are their stories.

00:22.656 --> 00:26.060
- How dare we continue
to glorify

00:26.094 --> 00:28.762
Thomas Jefferson,

00:28.796 --> 00:30.831
a slave owner

00:30.864 --> 00:33.267
who raped his slave mistress?

00:33.301 --> 00:34.668
Exactly.

00:34.702 --> 00:37.338
I know.
And why stop there?

00:37.371 --> 00:40.841
The liberals want to put
Susan B. Anthony on our money.

00:43.311 --> 00:44.778
But I think they forgot,

00:44.812 --> 00:47.615
she said she would
cut off her own arm

00:47.648 --> 00:50.484
before helping Negroes
to get the right to vote.

00:50.518 --> 00:52.620
Yeah, I know.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.755
She was a racist too.

00:54.788 --> 00:56.624
Guess who else was?

00:56.657 --> 00:58.092
- Ugh.
- Gandhi.

00:58.126 --> 01:00.528
He called Africans "savages."

01:00.561 --> 01:02.696
But meanwhile,
the liberal snowflakes,

01:02.730 --> 01:05.266
they're concerned
with tearing down statues

01:05.299 --> 01:07.701
of Andrew Jackson...

01:07.735 --> 01:10.304
Jefferson Davis.

01:10.338 --> 01:13.241
I think they forgot
those guys are all Democrats.

01:13.274 --> 01:15.709
Just saying.

01:15.743 --> 01:19.313
And that is why I come to
college campuses like Hudson...

01:19.347 --> 01:22.683
Yeah, Hudson!

01:22.716 --> 01:24.285
Because in many cases,

01:24.318 --> 01:25.819
I'm the only conservative voice

01:25.853 --> 01:28.222
they will hear in four years.

01:28.256 --> 01:29.723
- We don't want you here!

01:29.757 --> 01:31.459
- Shut up and let her speak!

01:31.492 --> 01:36.264
- A totalitarian PC culture
has taken over this country,

01:36.297 --> 01:39.167
and you know what?
We are sick of it.

01:42.470 --> 01:45.173
- We're sick of you!
Let's go!

01:45.206 --> 01:46.874
No Nazis, no KKK...

01:46.907 --> 01:48.442
all: No fascist USA!

01:48.476 --> 01:49.910
- That's what
I'm talking about.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.412
Do you see this?

01:51.445 --> 01:53.414
Students have become
so brainwashed

01:53.447 --> 01:56.350
that they are opposing
free speech.

01:56.384 --> 01:58.852
You don't even know what
you're fighting for anymore.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.793
- Go home!
Go home!

02:05.826 --> 02:06.860
- Stay back.

02:06.894 --> 02:10.798
*

02:10.831 --> 02:13.801
- You people have forgotten
what you're fighting for.

02:37.225 --> 02:38.926
- Ma'am!
Ma'am!

02:38.959 --> 02:41.262
Are you okay?

02:41.295 --> 02:44.298
I need an ambulance
to the Hudson quad right now.

02:50.738 --> 02:51.239
.

02:53.874 --> 03:01.282
*

03:37.418 --> 03:39.653
- Task force declared
an illegal assembly,

03:39.687 --> 03:41.422
chased everyone away.

03:41.455 --> 03:43.424
Vic's bodyguard was knocked out
in the brawl.

03:43.457 --> 03:45.993
He's with the EMTs.
- I'll go check on him.

03:46.026 --> 03:47.528
- Blue windbreakers.

03:47.561 --> 03:50.798
TARU must have
this mess on videotape.

03:52.466 --> 03:54.402
Hey.

03:54.435 --> 03:55.969
Ms. Cobb.

03:56.003 --> 03:57.705
Ms. Cobb, can you hear me?

03:57.738 --> 03:59.540
- She's been in and out.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.309
- Might be some kind
of brain injury.

04:01.342 --> 04:03.311
We better get going.
- Okay.

04:03.344 --> 04:05.979
I'll ride with her.

04:13.421 --> 04:16.824
Martha, I'm Lieutenant Benson
from the NYPD.

04:16.857 --> 04:19.327
You're on your way
to the hospital.

04:19.360 --> 04:23.531
Um...what...
what happened?

04:23.564 --> 04:24.998
- You were attacked

04:25.032 --> 04:27.901
during your speech
at Hudson University.

04:27.935 --> 04:30.904
Martha, do you remember
anything?

04:32.373 --> 04:34.442
- A--a mob.

04:34.475 --> 04:38.346
There was a mob
and, um...

04:38.379 --> 04:39.980
Someone hit me from behind.

04:40.013 --> 04:42.049
- Okay.
Did you see who hit you?

04:51.425 --> 04:53.994
- Did you see
who did this to you?

04:55.963 --> 04:58.065
- A man held me down.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.902
- Okay, so when we get
to the hospital,

05:01.935 --> 05:06.039
a doctor is going to conduct
a forensic examination.

05:06.073 --> 05:09.443
The exam can provide evidence
for us.

05:09.477 --> 05:10.911
Okay?
But I promise,

05:10.944 --> 05:14.548
we're not gonna do anything
without your consent.

05:21.755 --> 05:22.956
Just rest.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.759
We're gonna be there soon.

05:28.462 --> 05:30.631
- My CO told us to sweep
the area for stragglers,

05:30.664 --> 05:32.433
but all the protestors
were gone

05:32.466 --> 05:34.468
by the time we got back.

05:34.502 --> 05:36.036
- Nothing on this area.

05:38.506 --> 05:39.773
- Hold on.

05:42.876 --> 05:45.479
That's blood.
Right?

05:45.513 --> 05:47.381
This looks like
a protest sign was torn off.

05:47.415 --> 05:49.683
- A lot of signs left behind
on the quad.

05:49.717 --> 05:51.051
- Here, come with us.

05:51.084 --> 05:52.986
Let's look for the match.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.661
- "Alt Right Delete."

06:00.694 --> 06:01.962
- Now, this one's subtle.

06:01.995 --> 06:04.398
"Diversity is code
for white genocide."

06:04.432 --> 06:05.966
- Hey, check this out.

06:05.999 --> 06:09.036
Here's one with
its piece torn out.

06:09.069 --> 06:11.505
Perfect fit.

06:11.539 --> 06:14.442
Which side was that?
- I don't recognize it either.

06:14.475 --> 06:16.444
- Find out who organized
the rally.

06:16.477 --> 06:18.111
See if they do.
- All right.

06:21.782 --> 06:23.917
- So you're the president
of the Young Conservatives club

06:23.951 --> 06:25.453
here at Hudson?
- Yeah.

06:25.486 --> 06:27.154
- Well, you paid Martha Cobb
to come speak here.

06:27.187 --> 06:29.457
Who was invited?
- It was a Facebook event

06:29.490 --> 06:30.991
open to anyone interested
in what Martha had to say.

06:31.024 --> 06:33.794
- Okay, so white supremacists,
Nazis, wannabe KKK members.

06:33.827 --> 06:36.029
Any group I'm missing?
- We hate being associated

06:36.063 --> 06:39.132
with that crap, but it's not
our place to turn people away.

06:39.166 --> 06:40.601
- Point taken.
- Did you see

06:40.634 --> 06:42.536
the wanted poster
the alt

06:42.570 --> 06:45.606
All because I believe
in free speech.

06:45.639 --> 06:48.442
- "Henry Anderson invited
Martha Cobb to Hudson.

06:48.476 --> 06:49.877
If you see him,
let him know what you think."

06:49.910 --> 06:52.112
- Wages are flat,
we live in a welfare state,

06:52.145 --> 06:54.014
and I'm getting harassed

06:54.047 --> 06:55.483
for being willing
to talk about it.

06:55.516 --> 06:58.452
- Okay, well, do you recognize
this symbol?

06:58.486 --> 07:00.020
- That's Antifa,
the anti-fascists.

07:00.053 --> 07:02.656
- Do you remember anyone
holding that sign at the rally?

07:02.690 --> 07:05.559
- The Progressive Coalition
organized the counter-protest.

07:05.593 --> 07:09.162
They were making signs
in the student lounge.

07:09.196 --> 07:10.564
- This is a safe space.

07:10.598 --> 07:12.099
We're here for support,
not to incite.

07:12.132 --> 07:15.536
- We didn't turn anyone away,

07:15.569 --> 07:17.237
but I got nervous
when the black bloc

07:17.270 --> 07:19.106
antifa contingent showed up.

07:19.139 --> 07:20.908
I mean, I'm against fascism,

07:20.941 --> 07:22.643
but I believe
in peaceful protest.

07:22.676 --> 07:23.944
- And they were here
to disrupt?

07:23.977 --> 07:26.179
- To shut down Martha Cobb.

07:26.213 --> 07:28.916
A few of them had clubs.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.852
- And did--did any of them have
protest signs?

07:31.885 --> 07:34.488
Maybe...maybe like this one?

07:36.223 --> 07:37.190
- I may have seen a few.

07:38.559 --> 07:39.927
- So you can arrest them
for a riot

07:39.960 --> 07:41.795
instigated
by white supremacists?

07:41.829 --> 07:44.598
- This isn't about politics.

07:44.632 --> 07:46.900
Okay?
A woman was raped.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.803
- Oh, no.

07:49.837 --> 07:52.072
Those antifa people...

07:52.105 --> 07:53.607
I don't really know
who they are.

07:53.641 --> 07:55.576
They don't go to school here.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.213
- Hi.
How's Martha doing?

08:00.247 --> 08:01.815
- She's shaken but stable.

08:01.849 --> 08:03.083
You know, her memories
are scattered.

08:03.116 --> 08:04.752
There's no description
of the perp.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.887
- M.E. confirms
it's Martha Cobb's blood

08:06.920 --> 08:09.757
on the cardboard tube.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.124
- Well, we're not getting
anywhere with Hudson,

08:11.158 --> 08:12.660
but this is TARU's footage.

08:12.693 --> 08:14.562
Now, we pulled a few faces
from the scrum,

08:14.595 --> 08:15.729
we sent them
to the FBI database,

08:15.763 --> 08:17.598
run them through
facial recognition.

08:17.631 --> 08:19.700
- So what about threats
leading up to the rally?

08:19.733 --> 08:21.969
All day, every day.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.704
- Well, we should still
sort through them,

08:23.737 --> 08:25.205
'cause some people
really hate her.

08:25.238 --> 08:27.575
- You know she wants
all Jews and Muslims

08:27.608 --> 08:29.209
to convert to Christianity,
right?

08:29.242 --> 08:30.878
- You know,
10% of what she says

08:30.911 --> 08:32.245
is completely outrageous,

08:32.279 --> 08:33.981
and it's to get your attention,

08:34.014 --> 08:35.816
but some of her positions
actually make a lot of sense.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.985
- Yeah, like closing down
Planned Parenthood

08:38.018 --> 08:39.620
or deporting the Dreamers?

08:39.653 --> 08:41.121
- Okay, we are
in a bubble here though.

08:41.154 --> 08:43.791
Half the country is pro-life.

08:43.824 --> 08:46.594
Pro-family values,
terrified of radical Islam.

08:46.627 --> 08:47.895
- She's a troll, Amanda.

08:47.928 --> 08:49.062
- Sure.

08:49.096 --> 08:51.131
But the more you dismiss her,

08:51.164 --> 08:53.166
the more you embolden
her supporters.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.703
- We're gonna have to continue
this debate at another time--

08:55.736 --> 08:57.805
or never--
because the DNA just came in.

08:57.838 --> 09:00.173
- That was fast.
- So, DNA was recovered

09:00.207 --> 09:02.710
from under Martha Cobb's
fingernails.

09:02.743 --> 09:07.615
The match was
to a Justin...Vichinsky...

09:07.648 --> 09:09.282
who was arrested last month

09:09.316 --> 09:11.652
at the anti-Trump rally
in Jersey.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.888
- I recognize that dude.

09:18.258 --> 09:19.793
- White dude who thinks
he's Bob Marley.

09:19.827 --> 09:22.796
- Yeah, without
the positive vibrations.

09:27.668 --> 09:29.169
- Kind of busy here, guys.

09:29.202 --> 09:32.305
- Were you at Martha Cobb's
rally at Hudson University?

09:32.339 --> 09:34.041
- Yeah.
Uh, hang on one second.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.943
Wendy!
Got a vanilla chai latte

09:35.976 --> 09:37.911
for Wendy!

09:37.945 --> 09:39.747
Yeah,
you guys did a crap job

09:39.780 --> 09:41.715
of keeping the peace.
- We saw the video.

09:41.749 --> 09:43.684
You did a fine job
of disturbing the peace.

09:43.717 --> 09:45.653
- Man, I was protecting
peaceful protestors.

09:45.686 --> 09:47.788
- You wore a mask
and rushed the stage.

09:47.821 --> 09:50.323
- Well, what about the scum
that Martha Cobb attracts, huh?

09:50.357 --> 09:51.625
Nazis

09:52.826 --> 09:55.663
Man, I yelled at her.

09:55.696 --> 09:58.065
- You don't go to the hospital
from getting yelled at.

09:59.667 --> 10:00.634
- Yeah, she was
sexually assaulted

10:00.668 --> 10:01.902
with a cardboard tube.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.337
Cool.
When's the parade?

10:04.371 --> 10:05.706
- What,
you're happy about that?

10:05.739 --> 10:07.107
- Well, maybe that's
what she gets

10:07.140 --> 10:08.709
for blaming a hurricane
that killed 50 people

10:08.742 --> 10:10.343
on the mayor's
sexual orientation.

10:11.779 --> 10:13.647
You're under arrest
for menacing.

10:14.782 --> 10:16.817
For protesting at a protest?

10:16.850 --> 10:19.052
Martha Cobb's off spreading
fascist propaganda

10:19.086 --> 10:21.088
and I'm the one being arrested,
everybody.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.823
That's right.
Take a good look.

10:22.856 --> 10:25.392
We're already living
in a police state.

10:30.097 --> 10:30.230
.

10:30.263 --> 10:30.931
- Thank you
for coming in, Martha.

10:33.200 --> 10:36.937
How are you feeling?
- Emboldened and empowered.

10:36.970 --> 10:40.073
- Well, I know how difficult
this must be,

10:40.107 --> 10:42.910
especially with
your public profile.

10:42.943 --> 10:45.112
- You have no idea
what my life is like.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.880
- Doesn't mean
that I don't understand

10:46.914 --> 10:48.882
what you're going through.

10:48.916 --> 10:51.785
- Do you people ever stop
with the empathy?

10:51.819 --> 10:54.221
- Which "people"
are you referring to?

10:54.254 --> 10:55.923
- Let me guess.

10:55.956 --> 10:59.159
You cried tears of joy
when Obama was elected

10:59.192 --> 11:01.461
said you'd move to Canada
if Trump ever got in,

11:01.494 --> 11:02.996
yet...here you are.

11:03.030 --> 11:04.865
- I was never going anywhere,

11:04.898 --> 11:07.334
but, right or left,
I want to find the man

11:07.367 --> 11:08.936
who assaulted you
and make sure

11:08.969 --> 11:11.371
that he is apprehended
and punished.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.375
So, um...

11:15.408 --> 11:17.477
you may have suffered
from something called

11:17.510 --> 11:20.147
"collapsed immobility,"
and it can happen

11:20.180 --> 11:23.250
from being overpowered,
and it affects your memory.

11:23.283 --> 11:26.920
It can get scattered
or even go missing,

11:26.954 --> 11:29.389
so I wanted to ask you if

11:29.422 --> 11:33.360
anything has come back to you
since we last spoke.

11:34.895 --> 11:36.163
- It may help if I see the face

11:36.196 --> 11:37.464
of the cockroach
who did this to me.

11:37.497 --> 11:39.733
- Well, he may or may not be
in the lineup,

11:39.767 --> 11:44.104
but if he is,
it can be an emotional shock.

11:44.137 --> 11:46.874
- More than having
a signpost shoved inside me?

11:48.241 --> 11:49.810
You don't have to treat me

11:49.843 --> 11:51.044
with kid gloves, Lieutenant.

11:51.078 --> 11:53.513
Let's just get this over with.

11:54.815 --> 11:56.750
Wow.

11:56.784 --> 11:58.085
- Hey.
Jed Karey.

11:58.118 --> 11:59.887
I'll be representing
Mr. Vichinsky.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.354
- Mm-hmm.

12:01.388 --> 12:04.224
- Oh. Well, this is gonna
be easier than I thought.

12:04.257 --> 12:05.959
- This way.

12:05.993 --> 12:08.228
Martha, just take
all the time that you need...

12:09.129 --> 12:12.165
- Let us know
if you recognize anyone.

12:19.973 --> 12:22.375
- Number six.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.044
- Where do you
recognize him from?

12:24.077 --> 12:27.881
- He was at Hudson with antifa,
screaming at me.

12:30.884 --> 12:33.153
- He's the one who attacked me.

12:38.926 --> 12:42.495
*

12:42.529 --> 12:44.097
Martha?

12:44.131 --> 12:46.433
- Yes.
It was him.

12:46.466 --> 12:48.335
Number six.

12:51.304 --> 12:54.474
- Call Barba.
Get him to arraignment.

12:56.944 --> 13:00.080
- Martha Cobb
is scapegoating my client

13:00.113 --> 13:02.449
to vilify
her political opponents.

13:02.482 --> 13:04.417
Did NYPD look at the--

13:04.451 --> 13:07.154
at the fascist contingent
of this rally?

13:07.187 --> 13:09.189
I know for a fact
there were half a dozen

13:09.222 --> 13:11.324
neo-Nazi sex offenders
in that crowd.

13:11.358 --> 13:14.094
Jed Karey certainly knows

13:14.127 --> 13:16.063
how to push the right buttons.

13:16.096 --> 13:17.230
- He's a protégé Bill Kunstler.

13:17.264 --> 13:18.598
Do we have a problem
with Martha's ID?

13:18.631 --> 13:21.268
- Well, she hesitated.
- So do other victims.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.070
- Still.

13:23.103 --> 13:25.005
- Do you think she'd make
a false accusation

13:25.038 --> 13:26.339
for political reasons?
- Look,

13:26.373 --> 13:27.875
I was there right after
they found her.

13:27.908 --> 13:29.209
- Mm-hmm.
- And I do not think

13:29.242 --> 13:31.244
that she is fully equipped

13:31.278 --> 13:33.947
to remember who assaulted her.

13:33.981 --> 13:36.216
- You don't like her.

13:36.249 --> 13:37.484
- Look, Rafa, I admit,

13:37.517 --> 13:39.619
I loathe everything
that she stands for.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.088
I do.
- But it's your job

13:41.121 --> 13:43.090
to advocate for her.

13:43.123 --> 13:45.492
- It's my job to trust
but verify,

13:45.525 --> 13:47.460
and with this case
getting fast-tracked,

13:47.494 --> 13:50.363
we didn't have time to rule out
the other suspects.

13:51.564 --> 13:54.001
- So do your due diligence.

13:55.402 --> 13:57.170
- "Dear Pete,
God bless you

13:57.204 --> 14:00.007
and God bless America.
Martha Cobb."

14:00.040 --> 14:02.075
Thank you.
Lieutenant Benson.

14:02.109 --> 14:03.877
I would've signed one
for you at the station.

14:03.911 --> 14:06.246
- We'd like to ask a few more
questions if we could, so...

14:06.279 --> 14:07.380
- Well, I'm kind of busy.

14:07.414 --> 14:10.250
But maybe you can
help me figure out

14:10.283 --> 14:13.386
who is harassing me
on social media, huh?

14:13.420 --> 14:16.256
"I'd rape Martha Cobb to death
if I got the chance,"

14:16.289 --> 14:18.658
and "Martha Cobb lies
about getting raped

14:18.691 --> 14:21.128
to make the left look bad."
- Don't engage.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.364
And we really do need
a few minutes.

14:24.397 --> 14:26.533
Thank you.

14:28.035 --> 14:29.502
- Excuse me.

14:33.140 --> 14:34.541
So, what is it?
- So, we just wanted to know

14:34.574 --> 14:37.144
if any of your memories
had come back.

14:37.177 --> 14:38.912
- I know who assaulted me.
You already charged him.

14:38.946 --> 14:41.281
- Right, but we're trying
to firm up the case

14:41.314 --> 14:43.016
for the trial, so, you know,

14:43.050 --> 14:45.185
how did he get you
out of the quad?

14:45.218 --> 14:47.287
Like did he say anything,
did--

14:47.320 --> 14:49.056
was there anybody else
involved?

14:49.089 --> 14:51.391
- I just remember him.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.226
Maybe if you--

14:53.260 --> 14:54.928
if you just look at
some of the other men

14:54.962 --> 14:56.997
from the brawl, you know,
it might trigger something.

14:57.030 --> 14:59.666
- Fine.
Okay.

14:59.699 --> 15:02.302
No.
No.

15:02.335 --> 15:03.336
No.

15:08.275 --> 15:10.043
Okay.
Are we done?

15:10.077 --> 15:12.579
- Hold on.
You recognized the last one.

15:12.612 --> 15:14.047
- Yes, yeah.
He's been at

15:14.081 --> 15:15.382
a few of my speeches.
Randy Platt.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.017
But my security already
checked him out.

15:17.050 --> 15:19.719
He's totally harmless.
Okay?

15:19.752 --> 15:22.022
Excuse me.

15:22.055 --> 15:24.457
Okay, who's next?

15:24.491 --> 15:25.625
Hi.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.728
- So Randy Platt's
the shot-caller

15:28.761 --> 15:30.263
for a group
of right-wing misfits

15:30.297 --> 15:31.598
in Suffolk County.
- And he lives at home

15:31.631 --> 15:33.433
with his mom
and spends most of his time

15:33.466 --> 15:35.502
vlogging and tweeting
to his social media followers.

15:35.535 --> 15:38.338
- An audience of dozens.
- No, not--not anymore.

15:38.371 --> 15:39.406
The Hudson riots turned
this guy

15:39.439 --> 15:41.074
into an Internet celebrity.

15:41.108 --> 15:44.011
Now, he uploaded this today,
and it just went viral.

15:44.044 --> 15:46.713
- Yeah, we knew they wouldn't
let Martha Cobb speak

15:46.746 --> 15:49.082
because she condemns
the PC dogma

15:49.116 --> 15:51.051
these feminazis disseminate.

15:51.084 --> 15:53.020
They want to silence any woman

15:53.053 --> 15:56.623
who doesn't demonize
the entire male race.

15:56.656 --> 15:58.558
It's time white men
stop being cucks

15:58.591 --> 16:00.660
and stand up
to these uppity bitches.

16:00.693 --> 16:02.562
- A Martha Cobb fan
that hates women.

16:02.595 --> 16:04.597
- That's par for the course.
- 14 words, brothers.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.566
"We must secure
the existence of our people

16:06.599 --> 16:09.336
and a future
for white children."

16:09.369 --> 16:11.738
Now, we try to be peaceful,

16:11.771 --> 16:16.476
but if we need to use violence
to take our country back

16:16.509 --> 16:20.513
from the cultural elites
and the globalist dupes...

16:20.547 --> 16:23.616
Well, so be it.

16:23.650 --> 16:28.188
*

16:28.221 --> 16:32.192
- Well, that doesn't seem
so "harmless" to me.

16:35.562 --> 16:37.264
- You know, as long
as we're tearing down statues,

16:37.297 --> 16:38.531
we might as well
cancel Thanksgiving.

16:38.565 --> 16:40.133
- Don't mess with
my favorite holiday.

16:40.167 --> 16:41.401
- Brought to you by Puritans,

16:41.434 --> 16:43.403
religious extremists
who burned witches

16:43.436 --> 16:45.105
and massacred Indians.
- Says the guy

16:45.138 --> 16:47.274
who goes to mass
on Columbus Day.

16:52.645 --> 16:55.348
Hey, Mrs. Platt.
- That's right.

16:55.382 --> 16:57.550
- Hi, uh--
your son Randy home?

16:57.584 --> 16:59.252
- No.
What do you want with him?

16:59.286 --> 17:00.620
- Ms. Platt, can we--
can we talk inside?

17:00.653 --> 17:02.389
I got this old
line-of-duty injury

17:02.422 --> 17:03.556
that starts acting up
in the chilly weather.

17:03.590 --> 17:05.725
- Oh, you poor thing.
Come on in.

17:08.628 --> 17:12.165
- I'm not really sure.

17:12.199 --> 17:13.466
- You read a lot
of Martha Cobb?

17:13.500 --> 17:15.835
- Oh, they're Randy's.
He adores her.

17:17.337 --> 17:19.606
- Signed by the author herself.

17:19.639 --> 17:20.773
Book-tour dates.

17:20.807 --> 17:23.276
- That must be him.

17:25.445 --> 17:27.747
Go! Back door!

17:29.382 --> 17:31.318
- This way.

17:31.351 --> 17:34.521
*

17:38.858 --> 17:39.192
.

17:39.226 --> 17:39.892
- I can't believe
those bastards

17:41.328 --> 17:42.829
set fire to my house.
- What bastards

17:42.862 --> 17:44.331
are you talking about?
- The one's who've been

17:44.364 --> 17:46.299
threatening Randy.

17:46.333 --> 17:47.800
- The people on the Internet.

17:47.834 --> 17:52.339
Randy showed me some of
the vile things they wrote.

17:52.372 --> 17:53.706
Oh!

17:55.175 --> 17:56.543
- They threw a bomb
in the house.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.111
- Those sons of bitches.
Mom, are you okay?

17:58.145 --> 18:00.513
- Good thing
the police were here.

18:00.547 --> 18:02.782
- Hey, listen, Randy.
Would you mind coming with us

18:02.815 --> 18:04.717
to the station,
just so we can sort this out?

18:04.751 --> 18:05.885
- Sure, I always love
helping the police.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.620
Mom, you go with Joe, okay?

18:07.654 --> 18:09.622
He'll make sure you're okay.

18:09.656 --> 18:12.325
- Okay.
- Come on, we're over here.

18:16.663 --> 18:17.864
- Did you find the antifa cuck

18:17.897 --> 18:19.599
who tried to kill me
and my mother?

18:19.632 --> 18:21.468
- Not in our jurisdiction.

18:21.501 --> 18:23.736
- Relax, Randy.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.639
Have a seat in here.
We'll explain everything.

18:26.673 --> 18:29.209
- It looks like your boy Randy
was doxxed online

18:29.242 --> 18:30.710
after he dropped
his latest video.

18:30.743 --> 18:32.179
- They posted his home address.

18:32.212 --> 18:34.814
- Address, cell phone, social.

18:34.847 --> 18:36.483
- Karma's a bitch.

18:36.516 --> 18:38.318
- Well, let's take it

18:38.351 --> 18:40.353
one step at a time.
Now, Randy,

18:40.387 --> 18:43.456
why don't you tell me about
this group you belong to.

18:43.490 --> 18:44.757
- Patriots for
the American Way.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.759
And I don't "belong."
I'm a founder,

18:46.793 --> 18:48.828
a grand wizard.
- "Grand wizard."

18:48.861 --> 18:51.531
That's--that's something
from "Harry Potter," right?

18:51.564 --> 18:53.666
- Yeah, go ahead.
Laugh.

18:53.700 --> 18:56.769
You'll thank me when
we make America great again.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.805
- Well, remind me.
When was it so great?

18:58.838 --> 18:59.939
Beautiful.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.474
A couple of lib-tards
on my case.

19:01.508 --> 19:02.775
- Yeah, well, let's talk about
where you were

19:02.809 --> 19:04.744
during the Martha Cobb speech.

19:04.777 --> 19:07.547
- On the quad, by the statue.

19:07.580 --> 19:08.748
- You wanted to be close
to her?

19:08.781 --> 19:09.816
- Well, protect her from

19:09.849 --> 19:11.384
the so-called "progressives"

19:11.418 --> 19:13.286
who wouldn't let her speak.

19:13.320 --> 19:14.954
'Cause we saw your video.
You hate women.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.456
- Not white Christian stock

19:16.489 --> 19:18.791
who raise families
and take care of their men.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.893
Look, and--and if they do
have a job,

19:20.927 --> 19:23.396
at least put on a pretty dress
and a pair of heels.

19:23.430 --> 19:25.265
- Well, we noticed
that you had most of her books.

19:25.298 --> 19:26.799
- Look, somebody tried
to kill me.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.601
Why all these questions
about Martha Cobb?

19:28.635 --> 19:30.537
- Because Martha
was sexually assaulted

19:30.570 --> 19:32.372
after the free-for-all.

19:33.706 --> 19:34.807
- So, where were you

19:34.841 --> 19:36.776
after the police
broke it all up?

19:36.809 --> 19:38.211
- On the way back
to Long Island

19:38.245 --> 19:39.446
with my brothers.
- Okay.

19:39.479 --> 19:40.813
Well, we're gonna need
their names

19:40.847 --> 19:42.215
and their contact info.

19:42.249 --> 19:44.817
So they can be firebombed too?

19:44.851 --> 19:46.419
Look, am I charged
with anything?

19:46.453 --> 19:48.655
Because if not, I'm exercising
my constitutional right

19:48.688 --> 19:51.758
to leave this stinking cesspool
you call a melting pot.

19:51.791 --> 19:53.460
- Just so you know,
Suffolk PD's checking

19:53.493 --> 19:54.794
on your guns,
making sure they're legal.

19:54.827 --> 19:56.796
- Then I got nothing
to worry about.

19:58.665 --> 19:59.866
- We pulled up
his social media.

19:59.899 --> 20:01.501
Now, Randy Platt followed
Martha Cobb

20:01.534 --> 20:03.270
up and down the East Coast
on her last book tour.

20:03.303 --> 20:04.837
- He was arrested
in three states

20:04.871 --> 20:06.906
for assaulting
peaceful demonstrators.

20:06.939 --> 20:08.708
He took a protest sign
from a lady in Virginia

20:08.741 --> 20:10.443
and hit her over the head.

20:10.477 --> 20:12.745
- Why do you rape somebody
that you've put on a pedestal?

20:12.779 --> 20:14.281
I mean, the guy
we have arrested,

20:14.314 --> 20:15.915
it's his DNA under
Martha's fingernails.

20:15.948 --> 20:18.418
- But they went mano a mano
at the riot, Amanda.

20:18.451 --> 20:21.921
And we all saw her waffle
when she ID'd Vichinsky.

20:21.954 --> 20:23.823
- Lineup can be stressful
for any victim.

20:23.856 --> 20:27.260
- I will rest easier
when we can rule out Platt.

20:29.929 --> 20:31.664
- Well, this is becoming
predictable.

20:31.698 --> 20:33.333
- Yeah, sorry
to bother you again.

20:33.366 --> 20:34.967
- That's okay.
- But you misrepresented

20:35.001 --> 20:36.969
your relationship
with Randy Platt.

20:37.003 --> 20:38.605
- There is no relationship.

20:38.638 --> 20:41.007
I signed a few books for him.
Is that a problem?

20:41.040 --> 20:44.043
- Randy and his, uh,
merry band of "Patriots"

20:44.076 --> 20:46.279
are on the DOJ's list
of hate groups.

20:46.313 --> 20:48.748
- Yeah, sadly,
there are a few wing nuts

20:48.781 --> 20:50.850
who view my events as...

20:50.883 --> 20:52.552
permission to act on
their basest instincts.

20:52.585 --> 20:55.922
- Well, his instincts
being violence and misogyny.

20:55.955 --> 20:58.358
That he's the one who raped me?

20:58.391 --> 21:01.027
- It's just a theory
that we're floating.

21:01.060 --> 21:03.663
And Justin Vichinsky's
lawyer claims

21:03.696 --> 21:05.432
that you are an opportunist

21:05.465 --> 21:08.335
who would exploit
her own misfortune

21:08.368 --> 21:10.970
to sell books.
- I don't pay much attention

21:11.003 --> 21:12.972
to what Marxist defense lawyers
say about me.

21:13.005 --> 21:14.841
That's a video from Hudson

21:14.874 --> 21:16.776
that we haven't seen yet.

21:16.809 --> 21:18.077
- A reader just
forwarded it to me.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.646
- Do you mind if
we take a look?

21:19.679 --> 21:22.415
- No, knock yourself out.

21:22.449 --> 21:24.351
- Now, I'm not saying
the assault didn't happen,

21:24.384 --> 21:27.053
but Martha Cobb clearly has
a political agenda.

21:27.086 --> 21:28.921
She's using
the police and courts

21:28.955 --> 21:31.558
to stoke resentment
and hatred,

21:31.591 --> 21:32.925
using social media

21:32.959 --> 21:34.994
to improperly
influence her case.

21:35.027 --> 21:36.863
- Jed Karey is
a world-class grandstander.

21:36.896 --> 21:39.599
- Bring the hype,
sell more tickets.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.801
- There is nothing
that she will not do...

21:43.436 --> 21:44.937
...to try and get
her warped ideas across.

21:44.971 --> 21:46.539
- Check this out.
- And I've had it...

21:46.573 --> 21:49.542
- This is--this is before
Martha Cobb's speech.

21:49.576 --> 21:52.078
- ...up to here.

21:52.111 --> 21:54.814
all:  No Nazis!
No KKK! No fascist USA!

21:54.847 --> 21:57.450
No Nazis!
No KKK!

21:57.484 --> 21:59.686
- Justin Vichinsky
in black pajamas.

21:59.719 --> 22:02.389
- The sign he's carrying
is identical to the one

22:02.422 --> 22:03.990
Martha Cobb was assaulted with.

22:04.023 --> 22:07.694
Martha's ID was rock solid.

22:07.727 --> 22:09.729
- Huh. That's kind of a bummer.

22:09.762 --> 22:11.431
- You had your money
on our guy Randy?

22:11.464 --> 22:13.032
- What, are you saying
you didn't?

22:13.065 --> 22:15.435
- I learned a long time ago
in this job,

22:15.468 --> 22:18.471
it doesn't make sense
to play politics.

22:21.040 --> 22:23.476
*

22:26.679 --> 22:26.979
.

22:27.013 --> 22:27.747
- Well, this is
a real waste of time.

22:28.948 --> 22:30.016
I can handle Jed Karey
in my sleep.

22:30.049 --> 22:31.418
- He won't be sleeping.

22:31.451 --> 22:33.085
He's gonna turn
your cross-examination

22:33.119 --> 22:34.821
into political theater.
- Let him.

22:34.854 --> 22:36.122
I'll weaponize
every liberal trope

22:36.155 --> 22:37.824
he can wrap his meaty
little mouth around.

22:37.857 --> 22:40.560
- It's very important that
you don't let him bait you.

22:40.593 --> 22:44.397
And remember that here,
you're a victim, right?

22:44.431 --> 22:45.965
Not a pundit.
- Fine.

22:45.998 --> 22:47.434
- I don't think
you're hearing us.

22:47.467 --> 22:49.736
If you turn this
into an info-war on MSNBC,

22:49.769 --> 22:51.037
you're gonna lose some jurors.

22:51.070 --> 22:52.772
Be sympathetic.
Be accessible--

22:52.805 --> 22:54.907
- I'll be who I am.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.445
- Okay.

22:58.478 --> 22:59.979
Let's talk about
some of the areas

23:00.012 --> 23:02.114
that Karey might get into.
- Mr. Barba.

23:02.148 --> 23:05.485
Relax.

23:05.518 --> 23:07.520
This is in the bag.
Okay?

23:07.554 --> 23:12.659
Why don't you just give me
the where and the when?

23:19.031 --> 23:20.600
- Well, let's just say
that she doesn't present

23:20.633 --> 23:21.868
as your typical rape victim.

23:23.936 --> 23:26.205
Martha Cobb has made a career

23:26.238 --> 23:29.609
out of playing fast and loose
with the facts.

23:29.642 --> 23:31.744
Fact: she was raped.

23:31.778 --> 23:35.482
- Right, and that doesn't
endow her with sainthood.

23:35.515 --> 23:37.584
She dissembles
for a living, Rafael.

23:37.617 --> 23:40.019
It's what she does.

23:40.052 --> 23:42.088
- Here we go.

23:47.960 --> 23:50.162
- ...five minutes
into my speech,

23:50.196 --> 23:52.799
when a water bottle
whizzed past my head

23:52.832 --> 23:54.967
and my security tried
to escort me to safety,

23:55.001 --> 23:59.506
but these antifa thugs
descended on me,

23:59.539 --> 24:01.974
screaming in my face,
clawing at me,

24:02.008 --> 24:03.776
so I--I just started running.

24:06.078 --> 24:08.915
- Someone smashed me
over the head from behind,

24:08.948 --> 24:13.152
and the next thing I remember
was a man pinning me down

24:13.185 --> 24:15.221
and ramming an object into me.

24:15.254 --> 24:17.123
- Do you see that man
in this courtroom?

24:17.156 --> 24:20.993
- Yes. Him.
The defendant.

24:21.027 --> 24:23.129
- Nothing further
from the people.

24:25.131 --> 24:28.601
- You mentioned antifa
several times, Ms. Cobb.

24:28.635 --> 24:31.838
You seem to have a lot of
animosity towards these people.

24:31.871 --> 24:34.173
- Mm, the feeling is mutual.

24:34.206 --> 24:36.876
- Antifa are a bunch

24:36.909 --> 24:38.678
of armed agitators
and anarchists

24:38.711 --> 24:41.681
who oppose capitalism
and destroy private property.

24:41.714 --> 24:43.182
What's not to love?

24:43.215 --> 24:46.853
- So you're predisposed
to wish ill toward my client.

24:46.886 --> 24:48.721
- I am predisposed to wish ill

24:48.755 --> 24:51.223
towards the type of terrorist
you choose to represent.

24:51.257 --> 24:53.092
- I'm defending a man
charged with a crime

24:53.125 --> 24:54.761
in accordance with
the Sixth Amendment.

24:54.794 --> 24:57.697
- Oh, I love how you liberals
are just so enamored

24:57.730 --> 24:59.632
of the Bill of Rights
when it comes to criminals.

24:59.666 --> 25:00.833
- Accused criminals.

25:00.867 --> 25:03.002
- But when it comes
to a law-abiding citizen

25:03.035 --> 25:04.604
who tries to express
themselves freely

25:04.637 --> 25:06.606
or buy a gun
to defend their family,

25:06.639 --> 25:08.274
you get your panties
all up in a bunch.

25:08.307 --> 25:12.579
- Is this one of your books
with a picture of you

25:12.612 --> 25:15.014
in a skimpy outfit
on the cover?

25:15.047 --> 25:16.716
- Yes.
That "skimpy outfit"

25:16.749 --> 25:18.284
put me on the "New York Times"
best-seller list

25:18.317 --> 25:19.852
for 43 straight weeks.

25:19.886 --> 25:22.889
- So, what are you selling
your readers, Ms. Cobb?

25:22.922 --> 25:25.725
Ideas or T and A?

25:25.758 --> 25:27.293
- Objection.
This is all very entertaining,

25:27.326 --> 25:28.961
but...

25:28.995 --> 25:30.797
- You really wanna ask me
about my ass

25:30.830 --> 25:32.899
after what I've been through?

25:32.932 --> 25:35.167
- Withdrawn.
Let's try this.

25:35.201 --> 25:40.640
On page 213 of this book,
you state,

25:40.673 --> 25:44.711
"99% of all rape accusations
are fabricated."

25:44.744 --> 25:46.713
- That's right.
Mostly young girls

25:46.746 --> 25:48.615
with no self-esteem
trying to get attention.

25:48.648 --> 25:52.819
- But you're one of the 1%
of girls who don't lie?

25:52.852 --> 25:57.089
- I was referring to so-called
"acquaintance rape" in my book.

25:57.123 --> 25:59.626
I was hit over the head
and penetrated

25:59.659 --> 26:01.628
with a cardboard tube,
Counselor.

26:01.661 --> 26:03.129
And that might be
in your sexual repertoire,

26:03.162 --> 26:05.064
but it's not something I enjoy.

26:05.097 --> 26:06.633
- Lieutenant Benson
questioned you

26:06.666 --> 26:08.801
about another suspect.
A man named Randy Platt.

26:08.835 --> 26:10.036
- Yes. That's right.

26:10.069 --> 26:11.303
- He's one of
your alt

26:11.337 --> 26:13.305
- Your characterization,
not mine.

26:13.339 --> 26:15.908
- But he is
an ideological ally?

26:15.942 --> 26:18.778
- He is a reader
who buys my books

26:18.811 --> 26:20.179
and attends my speeches.

26:20.212 --> 26:22.214
- A little easier to accuse
a stranger who opposes you

26:22.248 --> 26:23.382
than an acquaintance

26:23.415 --> 26:24.651
who worships the ground
you walk on,

26:24.684 --> 26:26.018
I suppose.
- Objection.

26:26.052 --> 26:27.219
- Sustained.

26:27.253 --> 26:29.155
- Uh, just one last question.

26:29.188 --> 26:31.190
Where did you stay
the night before

26:31.223 --> 26:33.159
your speech at Hudson?

26:34.260 --> 26:36.629
- The Young Conservatives Club
at Hudson

26:36.663 --> 26:38.698
put me up at
the Park Milano Hotel.

26:40.266 --> 26:42.969
- Sweet.
Five stars.

26:43.002 --> 26:44.637
Nothing further.

26:49.175 --> 26:51.277
- Excuse me.

26:51.310 --> 26:52.745
You're in my seat.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.415
- Well, I was
at the legal aid bar.

26:56.448 --> 26:58.184
Too many lawyers
buying me drinks.

26:58.217 --> 27:00.319
I literally had ten beers
lined up in front of me

27:00.352 --> 27:02.855
on the bar.
- That is such a nice perk

27:02.889 --> 27:05.692
for representing a rapist.

27:05.725 --> 27:08.094
- Scotch.

27:08.127 --> 27:09.962
- Your best Scotch
for this guy.

27:09.996 --> 27:10.963
- Thanks.

27:10.997 --> 27:12.364
- Well, it wasn't my guy

27:12.398 --> 27:14.100
they're all fired up about.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.368
It was Martha Cobb.

27:16.402 --> 27:18.370
- Your lefty pals
are hypocrites.

27:20.006 --> 27:21.307
- I don't think my guy did it.

27:21.340 --> 27:23.309
That was unexpected.

27:23.342 --> 27:25.111
- Look, you know
I love this game

27:25.144 --> 27:27.379
as much as anyone, Rafael,
but this guy...

27:27.413 --> 27:29.181
I don't think
he's got it in him.

27:29.215 --> 27:30.883
My guess?
He goes to these rallies

27:30.917 --> 27:33.285
to meet girls.

27:33.319 --> 27:36.789
- Tell me about
the Park Milano Hotel.

27:38.490 --> 27:41.761
Eh, just a little dig
on the 1% of it all.

27:48.868 --> 27:50.803
- Okay, let me be totally
up front about this.

27:50.837 --> 27:53.806
I despise Martha Cobb...

27:53.840 --> 27:56.008
but I did not
sexually assault her.

27:56.042 --> 27:57.276
- How do you explain the fact

27:57.309 --> 27:59.879
that your DNA was found
under her fingernails?

27:59.912 --> 28:01.981
All right, look.

28:02.014 --> 28:04.951
When the chaos started
at Hudson, I got in her face.

28:04.984 --> 28:06.118
She pushed me away.

28:06.152 --> 28:07.820
We started to grapple
a little bit.

28:07.854 --> 28:10.890
You know, and I'm sorry
that I accosted her like that.

28:10.923 --> 28:12.324
But that's it.
I swear.

28:12.358 --> 28:13.926
That was the only time
I ever laid a hand on her.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.762
- You've heard the testimony,
Justin,

28:15.795 --> 28:17.429
that it was
your cardboard tube

28:17.463 --> 28:19.098
that was used to penetrate her.

28:19.131 --> 28:21.167
- And maybe it was.
I really don't know,

28:21.200 --> 28:22.769
because right before
all of this went down,

28:22.802 --> 28:24.737
one of those alt-right goons
grabbed it out of my hands.

28:24.771 --> 28:26.505
- Do you remember
who the man was?

28:26.538 --> 28:27.439
- Oh, yeah.

28:27.473 --> 28:29.308
Pale white guy.
Moon face,

28:29.341 --> 28:31.277
short blond hair, glasses.

28:33.479 --> 28:34.914
Yeah, that's him.

28:34.947 --> 28:36.448
Snatched the sign
right out of my hand,

28:36.482 --> 28:39.251
and I never saw it again.

28:39.285 --> 28:40.887
- Hmm.

28:43.990 --> 28:45.191
- That photo you identified

28:45.224 --> 28:46.926
is of a man named Randy Platt,
correct?

28:46.959 --> 28:48.194
- I don't know his name.

28:48.227 --> 28:50.897
- You weren't one of
the 19 million people

28:50.930 --> 28:54.100
who watched a video
of Mr. Platt spewing hate

28:54.133 --> 28:56.769
after the Hudson riot?
- Well, yeah, I saw that.

28:56.803 --> 28:59.872
It made me sick.
- "Sick."

28:59.906 --> 29:02.208
So sick that you invented
a convenient story

29:02.241 --> 29:04.143
about him taking your sign.

29:04.176 --> 29:06.478
- It's not a story.

29:06.512 --> 29:08.380
- You're a member of antifa,
aren't you?

29:08.414 --> 29:10.249
- I'm against fascism,
like any normal person.

29:10.282 --> 29:11.317
Aren't you?

29:11.350 --> 29:12.785
- I don't advocate violence

29:12.819 --> 29:14.220
against people
who disagree with me.

29:14.253 --> 29:15.822
- These right-wing extremists
wanna rip down

29:15.855 --> 29:17.023
everything
this country stands for.

29:17.056 --> 29:18.057
What are we supposed to do?

29:18.090 --> 29:19.826
Just lay down and go belly

29:19.859 --> 29:21.360
- You believe that Martha Cobb
is a right

29:21.393 --> 29:22.494
- Yeah, except she's way worse

29:22.528 --> 29:23.963
than the people
that she provokes.

29:23.996 --> 29:25.231
Like she has any idea

29:25.264 --> 29:26.999
what it's like to be
a hardworking American,

29:27.033 --> 29:29.836
with her prep-school privilege
and her gated Bel Air mansion.

29:29.869 --> 29:32.338
Sure, she presents
as this blonde beach bunny,

29:32.371 --> 29:34.173
but in reality,
she's the Joseph Goebbels

29:34.206 --> 29:35.875
of the alt-right
propaganda machine,

29:35.908 --> 29:39.345
and we need to stop her
by any means necessary.

29:41.313 --> 29:43.082
- Hmm.

29:43.115 --> 29:46.085
Disgust.
Lack of control.

29:46.118 --> 29:47.419
Rage.

29:49.521 --> 29:50.923
You just checked all the boxes

29:50.957 --> 29:52.825
on the rapist checklist,
Mr. Vichinsky.

29:52.859 --> 29:53.993
- Objection.

29:54.026 --> 29:55.427
- Withdrawn.

29:59.431 --> 30:00.833
Nothing further.

30:02.001 --> 30:06.605
- The defense has one more
witness to call, Your Honor.

30:06.638 --> 30:09.075
- I'm here because I was served
with a subpoena,

30:09.108 --> 30:10.209
and I obey the law...

30:10.242 --> 30:13.012
unlike some other individuals.

30:13.045 --> 30:14.546
- Why'd you attend
Martha Cobb's speech

30:14.580 --> 30:16.883
at Hudson University,
Mr. Platt?

30:16.916 --> 30:18.885
- Because we knew
the antifa cucks

30:18.918 --> 30:21.153
and the "Black Lies Matter"
crybabies

30:21.187 --> 30:22.955
would try to stop her
from speaking.

30:22.989 --> 30:24.556
- Now, who's this "we"
you're referring to?

30:24.590 --> 30:25.925
- I'm the leader of a group

30:25.958 --> 30:27.994
called Patriots
of the American Way.

30:28.027 --> 30:29.561
- Right, yeah.
According to your website,

30:29.595 --> 30:31.430
its mission statement is to,

30:31.463 --> 30:34.867
"Purge the country
of degenerate filth

30:34.901 --> 30:38.404
and create
a white ethno

30:38.437 --> 30:39.605
- That's right.

30:41.207 --> 30:43.309
- Well, just so we understand
this clearly,

30:43.342 --> 30:46.312
which members of the jury
would your group want to purge?

30:46.345 --> 30:48.447
- Objection.
- I'll allow it.

30:48.480 --> 30:50.416
You may answer.

30:51.984 --> 30:55.121
- Him, her, her,

30:55.154 --> 30:57.523
him, her.

30:57.556 --> 30:59.058
- Step out of this courtroom,

30:59.091 --> 31:00.659
and I'll kick the living crap
out of you.

31:03.963 --> 31:05.631
- All right,
let's all take it easy.

31:05.664 --> 31:08.334
- Oh, and just to finish
my answer--

31:08.367 --> 31:10.169
flannel shirt in the back row.

31:10.202 --> 31:13.973
I can't tell if he's a Jew
and/or a homosexual.

31:14.006 --> 31:16.442
We'd have to conduct
some research into him.

31:17.543 --> 31:19.946
- Mr. Platt...

31:19.979 --> 31:23.282
isn't it a fact
that you're an ignorant troll

31:23.315 --> 31:27.653
who fetishizes guns because of
your tiny, tiny hands?

31:30.089 --> 31:31.991
That's what Martha Cobb
called you

31:32.024 --> 31:35.094
at the bar
at the Park Milano Hotel

31:35.127 --> 31:36.695
the night before her speech.
- Wait a sec.

31:36.728 --> 31:38.998
- You made a pass at her there,

31:39.031 --> 31:41.433
and she proceeded
to humiliate you.

31:41.467 --> 31:43.069
- The three witnesses

31:43.102 --> 31:44.603
from the bar I have
waiting in the rotunda.

31:44.636 --> 31:47.673
Your hero emasculated you.

31:47.706 --> 31:50.943
That must have infuriated you,
right?

31:52.711 --> 31:56.248
So much so that you got payback
the next day

31:56.282 --> 31:59.518
at Hudson University--
- Dirty little shyster!

31:59.551 --> 32:01.220
- Nothing further.

32:09.428 --> 32:11.030
- First thing tomorrow,
Your Honor?

32:11.063 --> 32:11.797
Yeah.

32:11.830 --> 32:13.599
I think we all could use
a recess.

32:20.306 --> 32:21.707
- You heard.

32:21.740 --> 32:23.509
- The "Titanic" meets
the "Hindenburg"

32:23.542 --> 32:24.676
meets my first year
of Little League.

32:24.710 --> 32:26.678
- Martha never mentioned

32:26.712 --> 32:28.247
that she spurned
a sexual overture

32:28.280 --> 32:31.150
from Randy Platt
the night before the assault?

32:31.183 --> 32:33.652
- No.

32:35.587 --> 32:37.956
I'm gonna find out.

32:42.461 --> 32:42.628
.

32:42.661 --> 32:43.462
- I told you I knew
who Randy Platt was.

32:45.231 --> 32:46.698
- Well, you didn't tell me
that you humiliated him

32:46.732 --> 32:48.200
the night before
you were attacked.

32:48.234 --> 32:49.735
- Because it was irrelevant.
- Trust me,

32:49.768 --> 32:51.537
the jury doesn't think so.

32:51.570 --> 32:53.605
- Then Barba is incompetent.

32:53.639 --> 32:55.741
- If you would have given him
half a chance

32:55.774 --> 32:57.309
to get out in front of this--

32:57.343 --> 33:00.379
- I needed a bulldog for this.
A Rudy Giuliani.

33:00.412 --> 33:02.148
And instead,
I got a little schnauzer.

33:02.181 --> 33:05.317
- Martha,
I am not a fan of yours,

33:05.351 --> 33:07.086
and I think that your views

33:07.119 --> 33:11.157
on sexual assault
are reprehensible.

33:11.190 --> 33:13.092
But you are a survivor,

33:13.125 --> 33:16.228
and I really want to help you
get justice.

33:17.729 --> 33:19.065
- Always effective,

33:19.098 --> 33:20.766
the inspirational
mission statement.

33:22.734 --> 33:26.105
If you're pulling your punches
for ideological reasons

33:26.138 --> 33:29.241
because you don't have
the integrity to be honest--

33:29.275 --> 33:31.777
- Do not question my integrity.

33:31.810 --> 33:33.379
- Then how about
you drop the armor?

33:33.412 --> 33:35.114
How about you start
talking to me

33:35.147 --> 33:38.550
like a human being,
not a media personality?

33:41.220 --> 33:42.654
Can we do that?
Can we--

33:42.688 --> 33:46.392
can we just...talk?

33:46.425 --> 33:47.459
Please.

33:55.501 --> 33:57.269
When you ID'd Vichinsky,

33:57.303 --> 33:59.605
there was a moment
of hesitation.

34:01.173 --> 34:05.111
Now, sometimes that's because
it's the shock

34:05.144 --> 34:06.545
of seeing your attacker
for the first time,

34:06.578 --> 34:10.249
and sometimes
it's because of uncertainty.

34:12.584 --> 34:15.254
- I'm a target every day
of my life, Lieutenant.

34:15.287 --> 34:16.855
I can take it.
- I understand that.

34:16.888 --> 34:18.824
- And I'm a warrior.

34:18.857 --> 34:23.129
So to find myself
in this position...

34:23.162 --> 34:26.132
where I feel embarrassed...

34:26.165 --> 34:27.766
vulnerable...

34:27.799 --> 34:30.169
like the kind of
spineless victim

34:30.202 --> 34:31.470
that I ridicule...

34:31.503 --> 34:33.705
- Martha,
you didn't ask for this.

34:33.739 --> 34:35.574
You're under so much pressure,

34:35.607 --> 34:36.842
you don't realize

34:36.875 --> 34:40.579
that this is not your fault.

34:43.615 --> 34:48.687
*

34:48.720 --> 34:52.158
So tell me who did this to you.

34:52.191 --> 34:55.461
Was it Vichinsky?

34:55.494 --> 34:57.363
Or was it Platt?

34:58.730 --> 35:02.334
Or was it somebody
who's not even on our radar?

35:03.602 --> 35:07.773
- I remember Vichinsky
screaming at me.

35:07.806 --> 35:11.177
I remember his eyes,
his rage...

35:11.210 --> 35:14.380
it is imprinted on my memory.

35:17.583 --> 35:20.186
But after I got hit
on the head...

35:23.255 --> 35:25.657
Everything was a blur.

35:29.928 --> 35:32.364
The man who raped me...

35:37.936 --> 35:40.239
Maybe I conflated things.

35:44.310 --> 35:46.512
But I am pretty sure
it was him.

35:57.623 --> 35:59.225
That's a little different
than what she said

35:59.258 --> 36:00.392
on the stand.
- At least

36:00.426 --> 36:01.660
we finally know the truth.

36:01.693 --> 36:03.429
- I'm not about to impeach
my own witness, Olivia.

36:03.462 --> 36:05.531
- And you don't have to, Rafa.

36:05.564 --> 36:07.533
We both know that the law
doesn't require

36:07.566 --> 36:09.668
absolute certainty.
- We're not weighing

36:09.701 --> 36:11.703
her equivocation in a vacuum.

36:11.737 --> 36:14.440
There's an alternate set
of facts that's plausible,

36:14.473 --> 36:16.742
another viable suspect:
a racist hatemonger

36:16.775 --> 36:19.611
that I have to question in,
uh...  15 minutes.

36:19.645 --> 36:22.281
- Look, I know that
it's not the slam dunk

36:22.314 --> 36:23.615
that you were hoping for,

36:23.649 --> 36:26.818
but isn't that
what juries are for?

36:26.852 --> 36:29.421
My own moral compass
is going a little haywire.

36:29.455 --> 36:31.790
How do I put this
in front of a jury?

36:41.800 --> 36:44.570
- Are you ready
to proceed, Mr. Barba?

36:47.639 --> 36:49.308
- I am.

36:58.750 --> 37:00.586
Mr. Platt...

37:00.619 --> 37:03.989
did you assault Martha Cobb
with a cardboard tube?

37:04.022 --> 37:05.624
- Absolutely not.

37:10.028 --> 37:11.029
- It's a very simple question.

37:11.062 --> 37:12.564
Why should we believe you?

37:12.598 --> 37:15.901
- Because I'm giving you
my word under oath.

37:19.905 --> 37:22.007
Because, in my humble opinion,

37:22.040 --> 37:23.409
most of the people
in this courtroom

37:23.442 --> 37:25.944
think your word is garbage...

37:25.977 --> 37:27.746
that you don't possess an ounce

37:27.779 --> 37:30.349
of principle or virtue.

37:32.551 --> 37:35.621
Yeah, well, most people
are blind and stupid.

37:40.826 --> 37:47.866
*

38:07.953 --> 38:09.455
- The People are unable
to prove

38:09.488 --> 38:11.323
beyond a reasonable doubt
that Justin Vichinsky

38:11.357 --> 38:13.925
sexually assaulted Martha Cobb.

38:13.959 --> 38:15.527
Accordingly,

38:15.561 --> 38:16.862
I move to dismiss
the indictment.

38:16.895 --> 38:20.599
- The defense joins
in this motion.

38:20.632 --> 38:23.769
- Uh, this is highly unusual,
Mr. Barba.

38:23.802 --> 38:25.704
Are you sure that's
what you want to do?

38:25.737 --> 38:28.707
- I am sure that
the perpetrator of this crime

38:28.740 --> 38:32.310
will never be known
to a legal certainty.

38:33.445 --> 38:35.381
- I appreciate your candor.

38:35.414 --> 38:39.785
Very few prosecutors would have
the courage to make this call.

38:42.053 --> 38:44.122
The case is dismissed.

39:01.607 --> 39:03.709
What?
Wow.

39:14.620 --> 39:16.622
- We all knew
that Martha Cobb

39:16.655 --> 39:18.657
was exploiting
her victimization

39:18.690 --> 39:20.459
to further
her right-wing agenda,

39:20.492 --> 39:23.128
and fortunately, Justin
here has been vindicated

39:23.161 --> 39:25.997
from this politically motivated

39:26.031 --> 39:27.999
and slanderous accusation.

39:28.033 --> 39:29.568
And let me
tell you something...

39:29.601 --> 39:31.937
- What do you expect
from an immigrant prosecutor

39:31.970 --> 39:33.739
in the pocket of the fake,
liberal media?

39:33.772 --> 39:37.843
Look, we need to stand up
and fight for blood and soil

39:37.876 --> 39:38.944
and the values that made

39:38.977 --> 39:41.680
this white, Christian country
what it used to be.

39:41.713 --> 39:43.114
- Don't you just love
free speech?

39:43.148 --> 39:45.451
You get what you paid for.

39:47.085 --> 39:48.720
That's what you came up with?

39:52.057 --> 39:54.092
- Look, whether or not
I believe her,

39:54.125 --> 39:55.794
this woman deserves
her day in court.

39:55.827 --> 39:58.163
- But this case stopped being
a search for the truth.

39:58.196 --> 39:59.765
It turned into
a Rorschach test

39:59.798 --> 40:01.667
about which side butters
your political bread.

40:01.700 --> 40:04.503
I have to reach out to Martha.
- No, I got it.

40:05.804 --> 40:07.038
Thank you.

40:18.550 --> 40:20.786
- I must say, I'm a little...

40:20.819 --> 40:23.889
surprised that--that this
is where you wanted to meet.

40:23.922 --> 40:26.692
- I am all about looking
my enemies in the eye

40:26.725 --> 40:29.861
and landing a firm knee
right in their nether regions.

40:29.895 --> 40:32.798
I mean, figuratively speaking,
of course.

40:39.605 --> 40:43.441
- Martha, all I can tell you
about your case...

40:44.510 --> 40:48.213
Is that we don't always
catch the bad guy.

40:48.246 --> 40:50.982
And I'm very sorry.

40:53.819 --> 40:55.954
- No apologies necessary,
Lieutenant.

40:55.987 --> 40:58.089
I know I won't be
the first or last woman

40:58.123 --> 40:59.525
who doesn't get justice

40:59.558 --> 41:02.561
after being raped
at Hudson University.

41:08.066 --> 41:10.736
And if you think you have
issues with me now,

41:10.769 --> 41:12.103
wait till you read
my next book.

41:12.137 --> 41:15.707
It is a screed on the whole
criminal justice system.

41:15.741 --> 41:18.844
You know, based on
my recent experiences.

41:18.877 --> 41:20.278
I'll be sure to send you
an advance copy.

41:20.311 --> 41:23.048
- I don't have much time
for reading, Martha.

41:23.081 --> 41:29.054
*

41:29.087 --> 41:30.756
Be well.

41:33.024 --> 41:34.893
Take care of yourself.

41:52.778 --> 41:52.911
.

41:55.681 --> 42:02.888
*
