WEBVTT

00:01.035 --> 00:02.336
Scrub in with The Resident.

00:02.370 --> 00:04.372
This is a business.
It's not a charity.

00:04.405 --> 00:06.340
Catch all-new episodes Mondays,

00:06.374 --> 00:08.309
and check out
our other Fox programs--

00:08.342 --> 00:11.912
9-1-1, Lethal Weapon,
and Empire.

00:11.945 --> 00:14.014
We lost Empire,
but we are still here.

00:14.048 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.520
CONRAD: All we want to do
is help our patients,

00:19.553 --> 00:21.689
but what they don't teach us
in medical school is

00:21.722 --> 00:23.224
there are so many ways
to do harm.

00:23.257 --> 00:26.260
Previously on The Resident...

00:26.294 --> 00:28.162
-NIC: The surgery was canceled.
-They can't do that.

00:28.196 --> 00:29.263
Yes, they can.

00:29.297 --> 00:31.165
CONRAD:
Is your pride really worth more

00:31.199 --> 00:32.166
than the life of a patient?

00:32.200 --> 00:34.368
Chief of Surgery.
Resident.

00:34.402 --> 00:35.869
Try to remember that.

00:35.903 --> 00:38.272
You don't have the right
to play God, Conrad.

00:38.306 --> 00:41.041
AUSTIN: There's always art
balanced with science.

00:41.075 --> 00:44.011
-MINA: Just worried about him.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.879
Fortunately,
I happen to be Rembrandt.

00:45.913 --> 00:49.750
I think Lane's overtreating her
patients, including Lily.

00:49.783 --> 00:51.119
We have to do something
about Lane.

00:51.152 --> 00:54.355
We're gonna find out what it is.
Together.

00:54.388 --> 00:57.525
We need to have a physician
running Chastain.

00:57.558 --> 01:00.561
-The CEO will see you now.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.602
(indistinct announcement
on P.A.)

01:12.906 --> 01:14.875
Guess who's on a break?

01:14.908 --> 01:17.545
-Me.
: Yeah, you and me.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.647
Chastain can take care of itself
right now.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.615
Our downtime is finally
synced up.

01:21.649 --> 01:23.551
It has been a while.

01:23.584 --> 01:26.387
Patients are fine,
a quick page away,

01:26.420 --> 01:28.756
which is why
I've taken it upon myself

01:28.789 --> 01:30.791
to acquire these beauties.

01:30.824 --> 01:32.393
In the interest of time...

01:32.426 --> 01:33.894
Our chief resident,
Dr. Benjamin,

01:33.927 --> 01:35.563
is at a medical convention
in Denver.

01:35.596 --> 01:36.930
These keys are to his office.

01:36.964 --> 01:38.399
With a sofa and a locking door?

01:38.432 --> 01:39.800
A shower and a locking door.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.007
* Buy yourself a dream *

01:47.040 --> 01:49.477
* How's it looking? *

01:49.510 --> 01:50.644
* Buy yourself a car *

01:50.678 --> 01:52.746
* And a house to live in *

01:52.780 --> 01:56.417
* Get yourself a girl *

01:56.450 --> 01:59.119
* Someone different,
buy yourself a dream *

02:00.721 --> 02:02.356
* And it won't mean nothing... *

02:02.390 --> 02:04.592
Just leave it.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.794
CONRAD:
Damn it.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.499
Mine or yours?

02:11.532 --> 02:13.401
Mine.

02:16.504 --> 02:18.606
911.

02:18.639 --> 02:21.008
* It all could be different *

02:21.041 --> 02:23.177
* Time to do something new *

02:23.211 --> 02:24.645
* I've given everything *

02:24.678 --> 02:28.048
* I want to be
a happy man, too. *

02:39.693 --> 02:41.195
Secret admirer?

02:41.229 --> 02:43.397
Someone's getting jealous?

02:43.431 --> 02:45.466
They're for you,

02:45.499 --> 02:47.134
but Phoebe in the flower shop
does have eyes for me.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.303
I may have flirted my way
to a discount.

02:49.337 --> 02:51.071
-Yeah.

02:51.104 --> 02:52.840
Half Asian girl with...

02:52.873 --> 02:55.075
High-pitched voice,
drenched in perfume.

02:55.108 --> 02:57.711
I know Phoebe, and...

02:57.745 --> 03:02.049
I admire her work,
but this was unnecessary.

03:02.082 --> 03:04.952
Well, my perfectly stitched
heart begs to differ.

03:07.755 --> 03:09.189
Can you stay?

03:15.296 --> 03:17.365
I wish I could,
but I have a case.

03:17.398 --> 03:19.199
Newborn,

03:19.233 --> 03:21.769
sick heart
the size of a walnut.

03:21.802 --> 03:24.738
We have to reroute blood flow
so she can get oxygen.

03:24.772 --> 03:26.807
She's extremely high risk.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.355
What are her odds?

03:41.389 --> 03:43.357
Part of Mabel's heart
is underdeveloped.

03:43.391 --> 03:46.427
The defect is more severe
than we thought.

03:46.460 --> 03:48.762
Without surgery: two days, tops.

03:48.796 --> 03:52.199
With surgery,
she's got a real shot.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.402
Yeah, a long shot.

03:54.435 --> 03:57.204
Mr. Thoms, your wife
brought these beautiful twins

03:57.237 --> 03:58.906
into this world together.

03:58.939 --> 04:01.241
It is my mission to reunite them
in a few hours,

04:01.275 --> 04:03.143
and I am not in a losing mood.

04:03.176 --> 04:04.478
Rarely am I.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.482
I feel dizzy.

04:08.516 --> 04:10.150
Hey, stay calm.

04:10.183 --> 04:13.654
Okay? Just stay calm. Stay cool.

04:13.687 --> 04:17.491
Your pulse is ridiculously high.
Look at me.

04:17.525 --> 04:20.060
We can't have you stroking out
before I bring Mabel back

04:20.093 --> 04:21.995
to her brother Matt,
you hear me?

04:22.029 --> 04:23.797
-Help is on the way.
-Yeah.

04:23.831 --> 04:25.433
-Let's go.
-Okay.

04:30.804 --> 04:33.807
ANCHOR :
Today, a once-prominent
Atlanta oncologist,

04:33.841 --> 04:37.244
Dr. Lane Hunter, was arraigned
on one charge of murder

04:37.277 --> 04:40.981
and 12 charges of insurance
fraud and money laundering.

04:41.014 --> 04:44.452
Dr. Hunter is accused
of fraud and murder.

04:44.485 --> 04:48.088
She provided false medical
information to cancer patients

04:48.121 --> 04:50.324
in order to charge them
thousands of dollars

04:50.358 --> 04:52.693
in unnecessary chemotherapy.

04:52.726 --> 04:54.127
Did you take a shower?

04:54.161 --> 04:55.929
Don't worry about it.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.598
Where did you take a shower?

04:57.631 --> 05:01.835
Mr. Thoms, Dr. Hawkins,
this is Dr....

05:01.869 --> 05:04.605
Pravesh. We met in the ER
when my wife came in.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.306
-She's resting.

05:06.340 --> 05:08.776
And I'm gonna head back down
shortly again and check on her.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.811
CONRAD: We stopped by to
make sure you're feeling okay.

05:10.844 --> 05:12.646
BP a little high?

05:12.680 --> 05:14.147
Have a seat.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.852
Any palpitations?

05:18.886 --> 05:22.055
My baby girl's in the OR,

05:22.089 --> 05:25.693
my baby boy won't stop crying,
labor almost killed my wife.

05:25.726 --> 05:27.561
Now she's in the ICU.

05:27.595 --> 05:29.563
Yes. Palpitations.

05:30.898 --> 05:33.834
BP's 180/120.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.703
Normal protocol would be
to send you down

05:35.736 --> 05:37.304
to the ER for observation.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.407
There's no way in hell
I'm leaving my son.

05:39.440 --> 05:40.841
CONRAD:
Oh, we get it,

05:40.874 --> 05:42.376
but there's a rule

05:42.410 --> 05:44.512
against dads having
heart attacks in the NICU.

05:44.545 --> 05:47.681
Let us run some labs,
get an EKG, start you

05:47.715 --> 05:49.550
on some blood pressure meds,
make sure that doesn't happen.

05:49.583 --> 05:52.019
What do you say?

05:52.052 --> 05:54.488
-Okay.

05:54.522 --> 05:56.156
-JASON: Okay.
-All right.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.892
Um, I want to check in
on my wife.

06:05.899 --> 06:08.035
Dr. Pravesh.

06:08.068 --> 06:10.838
Melanie. Welcome back.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.606
You gave us quite a scare.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.775
You lost a lot
of blood during delivery.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.343
How are you feeling?

06:16.376 --> 06:19.112
How are my babies

06:19.146 --> 06:22.750
As you know, Mabel has
hypoplastic left heart syndrome.

06:22.783 --> 06:25.185
Prenatal imaging
can only tell us so much,

06:25.218 --> 06:27.755
so we didn't know the severity
of her heart deformity

06:27.788 --> 06:30.591
-until she was born.

06:30.624 --> 06:33.427
I haven't even met her yet.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.765
DEVON: Soon after birth,
she was taken into surgery,

06:37.798 --> 06:40.834
but I assure you that she is
in the best possible hands.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.316
NIC:
Dr. Sharavino

06:56.349 --> 06:58.986
called and said you're having
another flare

06:59.019 --> 07:01.955
Oh, fever, body aches,
yeah, the usual.

07:01.989 --> 07:04.458
Our mom also had lupus,
which led to kidney failure,

07:04.492 --> 07:06.093
and then she died,

07:06.126 --> 07:08.729
so "the usual" can be fatal
in our family.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.731
Well, we'll be extra careful.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.733
Any, um, sore throat,
congestion?

07:12.766 --> 07:14.434
Peeing a lot, a little pain.

07:14.468 --> 07:16.103
Okay, well, we'll definitely
run your blood work,

07:16.136 --> 07:17.505
but if it's anything like

07:17.538 --> 07:19.106
your last three admissions,
it'll be a UTI,

07:19.139 --> 07:22.075
so we'll get you started
on doxycycline to make sure

07:22.109 --> 07:24.077
it doesn't turn
into a kidney infection.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.913
Oh, she has a mild allergy to...

07:25.946 --> 07:28.248
To doxycycline. An antihistamine
should help head off the hives

07:28.281 --> 07:29.583
you got on your last visit.

07:29.617 --> 07:31.652
Um, will a doctor
be in soon or...?

07:31.685 --> 07:33.987
I'll be back shortly.

07:34.021 --> 07:36.657
-Can you get off that thing for,
like, a second?
-I would,

07:36.690 --> 07:38.859
but it's way more interesting
than you are right now.

07:40.327 --> 07:42.162
Run this blood work. Thanks.

07:46.166 --> 07:48.468
Hot, hot, hot, hot!

07:55.242 --> 07:57.344
NEWSWOMAN :
Legal experts note

07:57.377 --> 08:00.480
that if Dr. Hunter were
found guilty, she may face

08:00.514 --> 08:02.215
the death...

08:13.894 --> 08:16.129
-WOMAN: We need some help!

08:16.163 --> 08:18.365
MAN: Nurse! I need a nurse
over here for my kid!

08:26.607 --> 08:28.909
Bypass.

08:41.254 --> 08:43.323
Scalpel.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.425
Thank you.

08:45.458 --> 08:47.460
Ready for this?

08:49.697 --> 08:51.164
And here...

08:51.198 --> 08:54.201
we go.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.455
*

09:31.504 --> 09:33.707
Will Matt be okay

09:33.741 --> 09:35.709
Is she

09:35.743 --> 09:38.045
Do they have power?
Is she okay? What's happening

09:38.078 --> 09:40.580
-Mabel's with the best surgeons
I know.

09:40.614 --> 09:42.215
Matt will be fine.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.584
What about these other babies?
Are they all right?

09:44.618 --> 09:46.119
It's gonna be fine. Stay calm.

09:46.153 --> 09:49.589
-I got this.

09:49.623 --> 09:51.892
Matt stopped crying.
Why isn't he crying anymore?

09:51.925 --> 09:54.962
Get me an Ambu bag.

10:11.344 --> 10:13.580
JASON: He could have died.
What is going on?

10:13.613 --> 10:15.448
CONRAD:
The power went out.

10:15.482 --> 10:17.651
Likely due to the storm.
Backup power kicked on now.

10:17.685 --> 10:19.653
It's limited,
but we got emergency lights

10:19.687 --> 10:21.421
and necessary equipment,
so we're good to go.

10:21.454 --> 10:24.457
-Yeah, yeah.

10:24.491 --> 10:26.026
All right.

10:30.998 --> 10:32.800
Took too long
for those generators to come on.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.601
Yeah, that wasn't cool at all.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.636
I'm gonna go to the basement,
make sure everything's okay.

10:36.670 --> 10:38.171
Until full power's restored,

10:38.205 --> 10:40.173
revert back
to standard triage protocol.

10:40.207 --> 10:42.642
Put the sickest together,
get ready to evacuate if needed.

10:42.676 --> 10:44.544
Find me
if he has a heart attack.

10:44.577 --> 10:46.179
NIC:
All right, gather around.

10:46.213 --> 10:48.148
We're operating
on backup power now,

10:48.181 --> 10:50.317
so no computers,
no digital charts,

10:50.350 --> 10:52.052
and the paper ones are buried
in the basement, so...

10:52.085 --> 10:56.824
so, write pertinent information
on each patient.

10:56.857 --> 11:01.161
Write clearly, write concisely,
follow me.

11:01.194 --> 11:04.698
5920-- monitor urine output.

11:04.732 --> 11:06.233
We need him peeing like a champ.

11:06.266 --> 11:09.703
5921-- alcohol withdrawal,
taper diazepam.

11:09.737 --> 11:12.472
5918-- do not
ask about the cats.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.241
It gives him PTSD.

11:14.274 --> 11:17.044
5917-- check vitals every
30 minutes. Come on, keep up.

11:17.077 --> 11:20.013
Dr. Bell, should we deploy
emergency protocols A or B?

11:20.047 --> 11:22.582
Dr. Bell. Dr. Bell,
all computer systems are down.

11:22.615 --> 11:24.718
Dr. Bell,
trauma is completely jammed.

11:24.752 --> 11:26.219
Is that why you're not taking
any patients in the ER?

11:26.253 --> 11:28.188
Do you have a better solution?

11:28.221 --> 11:30.023
Dr. Bell, we're almost
at capacity down there.

11:30.057 --> 11:33.326
Dr. Bell, Ortho has a dozen
scheduled cases. Keep or cancel?

11:33.360 --> 11:35.662
-Is that why you're not taking
any patients at the moment?
-MAN: Computer systems are down.

11:35.695 --> 11:38.766
WHITLEY:
Mr. Bell, why is this happening?

11:40.367 --> 11:42.069
It's Dr. Bell.

11:42.102 --> 11:43.904
I recommend
thinking before you speak.

11:43.937 --> 11:46.206
If that's too much
of a challenge, don't speak.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.542
There's a massive storm outside.

11:49.576 --> 11:51.011
The power grid is down.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.445
There's a team
working with the city

11:52.479 --> 11:54.681
to get it restored
as soon as possible.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.049
The fire department
is on their way to help

11:56.083 --> 11:57.617
with emergency power, if needed.

11:57.650 --> 12:00.287
Treat all current trauma
patients, then shut it down.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.022
ER stays open to capacity.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.590
Let me know
the second that happens.

12:03.623 --> 12:06.193
Ortho hits pause.
Don't cancel a single surgery.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.961
Slide 'em an hour.
When we're back up,

12:07.995 --> 12:10.063
start cutting.
All hands on deck.

12:10.097 --> 12:11.631
Focus. Communicate.

12:11.664 --> 12:13.533
The hospital and our patients
will be fine.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.135
Decisions go through me.

12:15.168 --> 12:16.970
Get back out there.

12:21.274 --> 12:22.742
Albert, why are you still here?

12:22.776 --> 12:24.144
In regards to the trauma center,

12:24.177 --> 12:25.745
I think we can consider
a better option.

12:25.779 --> 12:28.248
Not unless you want
a one-way ticket to Caracas

12:28.281 --> 12:30.984
as your last stop
on the surgical train.

12:31.018 --> 12:32.619
Leave.

12:37.690 --> 12:40.627
AUSTIN:
You know, policy dictates

12:40.660 --> 12:42.462
that we abandon surgery

12:42.495 --> 12:44.631
until full power is restored.

12:44.664 --> 12:46.900
MINA:
Closing now is a death sentence.

12:46.934 --> 12:48.335
AUSTIN:
No doubt. But, legally,

12:48.368 --> 12:51.071
baby Mabel
was simply a sad casualty

12:51.104 --> 12:52.806
of unfortunate circumstances.

12:52.840 --> 12:55.742
What to do, what to do?

12:55.775 --> 12:58.278
Don't be dramatic.
You know what we're going to do.

12:58.311 --> 13:01.514
Oh, look who put
their big girl pants on today.

13:01.548 --> 13:02.983
Okafor...

13:03.016 --> 13:05.318
if we continue

13:05.352 --> 13:06.987
and Mabel doesn't survive--

13:07.020 --> 13:08.788
coin toss at this point--

13:08.822 --> 13:10.991
are you willing
to lay your head next to mine

13:11.024 --> 13:12.492
as Bell lowers a steel blade

13:12.525 --> 13:14.794
to the back
of our beautiful ebony necks?

13:14.828 --> 13:16.796
Gladly.

13:16.830 --> 13:20.333
AUSTIN: Is there anyone here
who is more concerned

13:20.367 --> 13:22.369
with their career
than saving Mabel's life?

13:22.402 --> 13:23.536
Quick show of hands.

13:29.376 --> 13:32.645
Nurse What's-Your-Name,
set the timer for 40 minutes.

13:32.679 --> 13:34.714
Yes, Doctor.

13:34.747 --> 13:38.018
Dr. AJ Austin's
Lonely Heart Club Band

13:38.051 --> 13:39.252
plays on.

13:46.026 --> 13:47.961
Backup power in the ICU
isn't working right.

13:47.995 --> 13:50.163
-I'm going to the basement.
-I was there. It's not good.

13:50.197 --> 13:52.632
Get back to the ICU.
Start triaging for evacuation.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.667
-Just go.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.739
We're stuck between floors.

13:59.772 --> 14:02.375
I'm claustrophobic.

14:02.409 --> 14:04.477
And you got in an elevator?

14:04.511 --> 14:07.480
Well, my bathmophobia is worse.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.482
I don't know what that is.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.718
It's the fear of stairs and...

14:11.751 --> 14:14.154
and-and st-steep slopes.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.755
Steep... steep slopes.

14:15.788 --> 14:18.458
Oh, my God, it's hot in here.

14:22.095 --> 14:24.064
Seems Mother Nature
has gifted us

14:24.097 --> 14:26.166
with some mood lighting tonight.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.168
-The storm
knocked out the power?
-Yes.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.070
And unfortunately
has held up Dr. Sharavino.

14:30.103 --> 14:31.438
But not to worry.

14:31.471 --> 14:33.073
I will be with you
your entire stay.

14:33.106 --> 14:35.875
Uh, is her lab work
back yet or...?

14:35.909 --> 14:38.611
Not until the power's back,
but knowing Joplin's history,

14:38.645 --> 14:40.413
we have a good course
of treatment.

14:40.447 --> 14:43.783
No offense, but my sister needs
to see a doctor, not a nurse.

14:43.816 --> 14:46.619
Your sister needs an antibiotic

14:46.653 --> 14:49.222
to treat a UTI that is quickly
becoming a kidney infection.

14:49.256 --> 14:51.558
I diagnosed it,
so I will treat it.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.760
If I need to tag in
an attending, I will do that.

14:53.793 --> 14:55.862
Badass. I like her.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.931
You're also gonna have
to stay the night

14:57.965 --> 14:59.866
for observation.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.634
I sort of dropped out of college
and have no future plans,

15:01.668 --> 15:02.902
so all good.

15:02.936 --> 15:04.271
All right, well,
here's your antibiotic,

15:04.304 --> 15:05.572
and I'll be back in a bit.

15:05.605 --> 15:07.040
I didn't know

15:07.074 --> 15:09.409
nurses do all that.

15:09.442 --> 15:10.944
I'm a nurse practitioner.

15:10.978 --> 15:14.481
We do most things doctors do,
just with better bedside manner.

15:16.449 --> 15:18.551
AUSTIN:
Storm's still a'ragin'.

15:18.585 --> 15:21.621
I like storms.
It's Earth's way of venting.

15:21.654 --> 15:23.957
Poltergeist. They had some
big-ass storms in that movie.

15:23.991 --> 15:26.826
Yeah, when that tree
came alive and snatched that kid

15:26.859 --> 15:28.661
out of the bed, I was like,

15:28.695 --> 15:30.463
"Yo, Spielberg knows what's up."

15:30.497 --> 15:33.133
How much time
do the generators give us?

15:33.166 --> 15:35.335
Could be four hours,
could be two. Hard to tell.

15:38.771 --> 15:39.839
That's your estimate, isn't it?

15:39.872 --> 15:41.274
For the backup generators?

15:41.308 --> 15:42.942
Eh, give or take.

15:42.976 --> 15:44.978
-Emphasis on "take."

15:45.012 --> 15:46.513
I've never worked in a hospital

15:46.546 --> 15:47.680
that's done proper
generator maintenance.

15:47.714 --> 15:50.317
Now, maybe Chastain
will surprise me.

15:50.350 --> 15:51.851
-34 minutes.

15:51.884 --> 15:54.021
That isn't enough time

15:54.054 --> 15:55.655
for the first phase,
and then you have to close

15:55.688 --> 15:56.923
after we place the graft.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.491
Now you're being dramatic.

15:59.626 --> 16:00.693
Trust.

16:00.727 --> 16:04.464
If all goes well
without one single hiccup,

16:04.497 --> 16:07.767
we will sail through
this painfully intricate surgery

16:07.800 --> 16:09.836
by the skin of our teeth.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.340
Suction.

16:17.910 --> 16:20.647
Every moment we turn away
or transfer patients,

16:20.680 --> 16:22.215
we hemorrhage money.

16:22.249 --> 16:25.018
Atlanta General and Emory
still fully functioning.

16:25.052 --> 16:27.987
The storm hasn't affected them,
so worst-case scenario...

16:28.021 --> 16:29.556
Is happening now.

16:29.589 --> 16:32.892
Dr. Hawkins,
this is a strategy session

16:32.925 --> 16:36.563
-for department heads only.
-Half the generators are down.

16:36.596 --> 16:37.997
And the ICUs--

16:38.031 --> 16:39.866
they don't have
any backup power.

16:39.899 --> 16:42.702
-How many patients
on life support?
-36.

16:42.735 --> 16:45.638
There are six empty beds
in Neuro with backup power.

16:45.672 --> 16:48.141
The others... We don't start

16:48.175 --> 16:49.842
relocating them
to a different hospital...

16:49.876 --> 16:51.544
Yeah, I know. They'll die.

16:53.746 --> 16:56.683
Time to start an evacuation.

17:03.390 --> 17:06.193
Ah, look at that.

17:06.226 --> 17:08.695
Perfect fit.
I'll hold it steady,

17:08.728 --> 17:11.398
you start
the proximal anastomosis.

17:11.431 --> 17:13.066
-Yep.

17:13.100 --> 17:15.435
I-I can't get
good visualization.

17:15.468 --> 17:18.171
If I'm a millimeter off,
that's a hiccup we can't afford.

17:18.205 --> 17:20.540
That's why the sutures
must be spaced

17:20.573 --> 17:22.442
closely together in the corners.

17:22.475 --> 17:24.944
-This area here
is prone to bleeding.
-I think I got it.

17:24.977 --> 17:26.646
Of course you got it.
Now keep stitching.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.719
We need to know what's happening
out there. Right now.

17:32.752 --> 17:35.722
Dr. Okafor, I need you to focus.

17:37.757 --> 17:40.093
Nurse, grab the house phone.

17:40.127 --> 17:41.561
Make a quick call.

17:41.594 --> 17:43.863
An update
on all things Chastain.

17:43.896 --> 17:46.899
Specifically ICU room 3124,

17:46.933 --> 17:48.535
-Micah Stevens.
-That's not necessary.

17:48.568 --> 17:49.936
We'll check on playboy,
then we'll

17:49.969 --> 17:51.704
cross your worry for him
off your to-do list.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.906
I do not have a to-do list.

17:53.940 --> 17:55.242
Liar, liar, scrubs on fire.

17:55.275 --> 17:56.909
You have a list,
you checked it twice,

17:56.943 --> 17:58.645
and now it's scratching
the surface of your brain space.

17:58.678 --> 18:01.781
-Stop it!
-Hell no!

18:01.814 --> 18:04.484
Your inability
to quell your concern

18:04.517 --> 18:06.219
for teacher man
could distract you enough

18:06.253 --> 18:08.788
to make the slightest
of mistakes.

18:08.821 --> 18:10.857
Not on my watch, princess.

18:14.261 --> 18:17.464
-Are you waiting for the world
to change or what?
-Oh...

18:17.497 --> 18:19.232
Make the call.

18:27.274 --> 18:29.142
ICU.

18:29.176 --> 18:31.110
Yeah, we're doing okay
down here.

18:31.144 --> 18:33.079
Micah?

18:33.112 --> 18:36.649
Yeah. Tell Mina he's fine
and he's staying. I will.

18:36.683 --> 18:39.286
Mina's in the OR.
She's fine.

18:39.319 --> 18:41.254
-Good.
-MELANIE:
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

18:41.288 --> 18:42.655
-Ms. Thoms, no.

18:42.689 --> 18:43.756
-Ms. Thoms...
-No, take your marker there

18:43.790 --> 18:44.991
and change this "go"
to a "no way in hell."

18:45.024 --> 18:46.793
-Ms. Thoms...
-Melanie, calm down.

18:46.826 --> 18:48.161
-No, I got it covered.

18:48.195 --> 18:50.197
Ma'am, this is
in your best interest.

18:50.230 --> 18:52.131
Her baby girl is in the OR.

18:52.165 --> 18:53.700
I got to get 30 heads
out of here.

18:53.733 --> 18:54.867
She's one of them.
She's on oxygen.

18:54.901 --> 18:56.135
I don't have a choice.

18:56.169 --> 18:57.637
Pravesh, why don't you
just let me handle...

18:57.670 --> 18:59.806
Put her on portable oxygen.
Take Mr. Sykes.

18:59.839 --> 19:02.542
TBI after an MVC.
Barb coma for a week.

19:02.575 --> 19:05.111
Bell will lose his mind.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.346
That barb coma

19:06.379 --> 19:07.480
has already billed
a quarter mil.

19:07.514 --> 19:08.548
Wow, Bolton, really?

19:08.581 --> 19:10.450
Bell freaks, it's on you.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.118
Yeah, I'll take it.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.354
Dr. Pravesh and Hawkins
are needed in the ER, 911.

19:14.387 --> 19:16.556
I'll take care of Melanie. Go.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.325
Thank you. Thank you.

19:18.358 --> 19:20.360
-I need a tank.
-NURSE: Right away.

19:21.894 --> 19:23.996
Yes, sir. I understand.

19:24.030 --> 19:26.399
Yes, I told him already.
Hold, please.

19:26.433 --> 19:28.535
Eastside General
has power and open beds.

19:28.568 --> 19:30.370
There is no Eastside General.

19:30.403 --> 19:32.138
There's Atlanta General

19:32.171 --> 19:34.674
and Eastside Medical.
Which is it?

19:36.343 --> 19:37.910
Just ask.

19:37.944 --> 19:39.412
Oh, no,
this is an incoming call.

19:39.446 --> 19:40.647
It's Marshall Winthrop.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.315
Return.

19:42.349 --> 19:44.150
But he's the chairman
of the board,

19:44.183 --> 19:45.552
and he's called three times.

19:45.585 --> 19:48.054
You can inform Conrad Hawkins's
dad I'm a little busy.

19:48.087 --> 19:50.056
He can wait. Indefinitely.

19:50.089 --> 19:51.424
MAN:
It's not the storm.

19:51.458 --> 19:53.826
Our problem has nothing to do
with the electric grid.

19:53.860 --> 19:56.296
Chastain's under attack
from cyber pirates.

19:57.364 --> 19:58.531
Pirates?

19:58.565 --> 20:01.200
That... can't be a thing.

20:01.234 --> 20:03.536
Classic move from an organized
foreign crime syndicate.

20:03.570 --> 20:05.905
They paralyze an institution,

20:05.938 --> 20:08.241
cause disruption,
ask for ransom.

20:08.275 --> 20:10.710
-You don't have security
in place?
-Yes.

20:10.743 --> 20:11.911
But it needs an upgrade,

20:11.944 --> 20:13.513
which I mentioned multiple times

20:13.546 --> 20:15.014
and the administration ignored.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.417
The upgrade you proposed

20:17.450 --> 20:18.785
took us off-line for days.

20:18.818 --> 20:20.420
We can't afford
that kind of shutdown.

20:20.453 --> 20:22.789
Well, now we're
shut down anyway.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.558
Ye...

20:26.559 --> 20:28.094
How much will it cost

20:28.127 --> 20:29.929
and how long will it take

20:29.962 --> 20:31.931
for you to fix this?

20:31.964 --> 20:33.199
There's no way to tell.

20:33.232 --> 20:36.436
The attack program that
hacked in keeps replicating.

20:36.469 --> 20:38.638
So if you want
to get this done quickly,

20:38.671 --> 20:40.707
your best bet
is to pay the ransom

20:40.740 --> 20:41.774
when the demand comes in.

20:43.810 --> 20:46.579
Your professional I.T. advice

20:46.613 --> 20:49.282
is to wait and pay?

20:49.316 --> 20:50.383
Yes.

20:50.417 --> 20:51.951
Good-bye.

20:51.984 --> 20:53.820
What?

20:58.791 --> 21:01.093
-HUNDLEY: I'm sorry,
you can't come in.
-Hundley.

21:01.127 --> 21:02.829
-Talk to me.
-No... We're at capacity.

21:02.862 --> 21:04.797
PARAMEDIC: Eight-year-old.
Gunshot wound to the abdomen.

21:04.831 --> 21:06.733
Hypotensive and tachy.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.501
I'm afraid, man. He's dying.

21:08.535 --> 21:09.802
HUNDLEY:
Dr. Bell made the call.

21:09.836 --> 21:10.837
We're closed to trauma.

21:10.870 --> 21:12.071
Make room for one more.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.606
You don't understand

21:13.640 --> 21:14.941
what's going on down here.

21:14.974 --> 21:16.576
There are no working ORs,

21:16.609 --> 21:17.777
and this boy needs surgery.

21:17.810 --> 21:19.278
We have no way to help him.

21:19.312 --> 21:20.847
I don't think he makes it
to another hospital alive.

21:20.880 --> 21:23.416
CONRAD: Zero chance he makes it
to another hospital alive,

21:23.450 --> 21:25.985
so we roll the dice here.
Audra! I need an airway.

21:26.018 --> 21:29.288
Check his breathing,
heart rate and BP. Page Nolan.

21:29.322 --> 21:30.590
Pagers aren't working.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.792
-Conrad, we can't save him here.
-Just get me Nolan.

21:32.825 --> 21:34.961
-Park him there.

21:34.994 --> 21:37.263
Returning my rig, and I saw
the kid laying on the sidewalk.

21:37.296 --> 21:39.499
I was only a block away, man.
I didn't know you guys

21:39.532 --> 21:41.368
were closed. It's my first
week. He's my first kid, man.

21:41.401 --> 21:43.936
-Please, I can't lose him.
-You made the right call.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.405
One, two, three.

21:46.573 --> 21:48.641
I need a trauma surgeon now!

21:57.550 --> 21:59.118
There's blood entering

21:59.151 --> 22:00.319
his abdominal cavity.

22:00.353 --> 22:02.054
No breath sounds
on the left side.

22:02.088 --> 22:04.323
-We're getting him.

22:04.357 --> 22:05.492
Thready pulse.
He's about to code.

22:05.525 --> 22:08.395
Get me a sterile blade
and a thoracotomy kit.

22:11.664 --> 22:14.734
Right now this isn't your fault,
but if you cut and he dies,

22:14.767 --> 22:16.869
it's on you. Don't risk it.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.609
#10 blade.

22:30.750 --> 22:32.752
Are we really doing this?

22:46.799 --> 22:48.835
His pulse is stronger.

22:48.868 --> 22:50.369
Get Nolan down here now.

22:50.403 --> 22:51.538
I need help
stopping this bleeding.

22:56.075 --> 22:58.611
-Oh, what the hell
have you done?
-CONRAD: Kid was dying.

22:58.645 --> 23:00.379
-I had to cut.
-You never have to cut.

23:00.413 --> 23:01.714
You're not a surgeon.

23:01.748 --> 23:03.783
You don't make
the decision to cut.

23:03.816 --> 23:05.184
I decide that.

23:05.217 --> 23:07.053
Let's say, as his doctor,
I decided to save his life

23:07.086 --> 23:09.021
by any means necessary.
Feel free to help.

23:09.055 --> 23:10.857
NOLAN: Begin the massive
transfusion protocol.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.859
Hang four units O-neg now.

23:12.892 --> 23:14.393
-We have to get him up to an OR.
-NOLAN: No.

23:14.427 --> 23:16.262
The generators are busted.
The entire OR

23:16.295 --> 23:18.431
is about to be pitch-black,
so there's no OR to send him to.

23:18.465 --> 23:20.733
Well, he's not stable enough
to transport him

23:20.767 --> 23:22.735
-to another hospital.
-Do the surgery here in the ER.

23:22.769 --> 23:24.103
No, no, no. There's not enough
room. It's not sterile.

23:24.136 --> 23:27.039
And, once again, it's about
to be pitch-black.

23:27.073 --> 23:28.875
I'm sorry, what's this?
Wh

23:28.908 --> 23:30.543
Wh
Where you think you're going?

23:30.577 --> 23:32.411
To build you an OR.
There's no viable ORs.

23:32.445 --> 23:34.481
You can't do the surgery here.
I'll build you an OR.

23:34.514 --> 23:36.783
Did it all the time in the
Helmand Province in Afghanistan.

23:36.816 --> 23:38.417
You just keep that kid alive.
Come on.

23:39.686 --> 23:42.755
* Young boy *

23:42.789 --> 23:45.658
* Trying to rule the world,
I see *

23:47.927 --> 23:50.329
* Well, golden *

23:52.198 --> 23:54.200
* But first you gotta
listen to me *

23:57.369 --> 24:00.172
* I'll tell the truth *

24:00.206 --> 24:02.675
* I promise you *

24:02.709 --> 24:06.345
* This world may frown upon
the things I have you do *

24:06.378 --> 24:07.413
* Oh, na, na *

24:07.446 --> 24:10.016
One, two...

24:10.049 --> 24:11.951
three.

24:11.984 --> 24:14.086
Portable floodlights
make a lot of heat--

24:14.120 --> 24:15.187
-they'll melt the drapes.
-Good call.

24:15.221 --> 24:16.789
Have them angle the rig
toward the window.

24:16.823 --> 24:18.958
* 'Cause the people going
nowhere are the ones *

24:18.991 --> 24:20.993
* That are flexing, I'm not
trying to be a preacher *

24:21.027 --> 24:23.295
* I was never a reverend, but
I can take your ... to church *

24:23.329 --> 24:24.931
* And show you glimpses
of heaven you better *

24:24.964 --> 24:26.432
* Run in some type of
direction, 'cause the people *

24:26.465 --> 24:28.768
* Going nowhere are the ones
that are flexing *

24:28.801 --> 24:29.769
* I'm not trying
to be a preacher *

24:29.802 --> 24:30.970
* I was never a reverend *

24:31.003 --> 24:31.971
* But I can take
your ... to church *

24:32.004 --> 24:33.540
Go.

24:33.573 --> 24:36.709
* Run *

24:36.743 --> 24:38.010
* Run from the devil... *

24:38.044 --> 24:39.712
CONRAD:
All right.

24:39.746 --> 24:41.814
All we need now is a patient.

24:41.848 --> 24:45.284
* You better run *

24:45.317 --> 24:48.555
-* Run from the devil. *
-Give me four units of O-neg
and a cooler on standby.

24:48.588 --> 24:50.156
Time to head out.

24:50.189 --> 24:51.858
If word gets out this is
happening, it might not be good.

24:51.891 --> 24:54.060
Head up to the ICU,
they need you up there.

24:54.093 --> 24:57.496
CHU: Pressure's stable.
100/60.

24:57.530 --> 24:59.398
-Good. We got a fighting chance.
-Depending on what we find

24:59.431 --> 25:00.533
inside this kid's abdomen.

25:00.567 --> 25:02.201
Scalpel, please.

25:02.234 --> 25:03.870
Why are all these patients
moving?

25:03.903 --> 25:05.504
Uh, with an extended
power outage,

25:05.538 --> 25:07.173
we have to move
life support patients

25:07.206 --> 25:08.808
-to different facilities.
-Oh.

25:08.841 --> 25:10.509
-No. I, um,

25:10.543 --> 25:12.078
-I owe you an apology.
-Oh, don't worry about it.

25:12.111 --> 25:14.080
No. Earlier, I was rude.
I just...

25:14.113 --> 25:17.083
Ever since our mom died,
I feel such a responsibility

25:17.116 --> 25:20.152
to help Joplin be the best
and the healthiest and...

25:20.186 --> 25:22.689
and I am babbling,
and you are very busy. Um...

25:22.722 --> 25:24.991
Just... You are beyond capable,

25:25.024 --> 25:26.826
-and I'm really sorry.
-Hey, you were being protective

25:26.859 --> 25:28.227
of your little sister.
I get it.

25:28.260 --> 25:30.296
And she's lucky to have you.

25:34.767 --> 25:37.003
We're not gonna make it, are we?

25:37.036 --> 25:38.838
You should take over stitching.

25:38.871 --> 25:41.507
AUSTIN:
No. Yours are pretty perfect.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.876
I'm only half-done with
the graft. You're faster.

25:43.910 --> 25:45.244
If that were true,
I'd be doing them.

25:45.277 --> 25:48.915
Perfusionist,
get out the manual crank.

25:48.948 --> 25:50.249
Wait, the power's running out?

25:50.282 --> 25:52.952
We'll have no lights,
no suction, no perfusion.

25:52.985 --> 25:54.353
Party people,

25:54.386 --> 25:56.055
it's time for you
to get in touch

25:56.088 --> 25:58.958
with your not-so-secret love
for the Sugarhill Gang.

25:58.991 --> 26:01.594
Why? Because in less than
eight minutes,

26:01.628 --> 26:03.429
we are not just going
old school,

26:03.462 --> 26:05.131
we are going O.G., baby.

26:06.666 --> 26:09.135
IRVING:
Calm breath out.

26:09.168 --> 26:11.203
Imagine someplace peaceful.

26:11.237 --> 26:12.705
A bubbling brook.

26:12.739 --> 26:15.474
You're not helping.

26:16.776 --> 26:18.544
What's your happy place?

26:18.577 --> 26:20.412
Happy. Think happy.

26:25.451 --> 26:28.821
Can I put my head in your lap?

26:28.855 --> 26:32.291
-Please.

26:32.324 --> 26:35.261
Okay.

26:35.294 --> 26:38.297
:
Why me?

26:38.330 --> 26:40.332
-Okay.
-Okay.

26:40.366 --> 26:42.134
-Yeah.

26:42.168 --> 26:45.437
-Better.
Mm-hmm.

26:45.471 --> 26:47.073
NOLAN:
Looks like our bullet nicked

26:47.106 --> 26:49.508
his descending aorta
and his spleen.

26:49.541 --> 26:52.411
-NOLAN: Well, that depends
what I find in there.

26:52.444 --> 26:55.181
BELL: So, just to clarify,
am I firing

26:55.214 --> 26:57.817
all of you because an internist
accepted a trauma patient

26:57.850 --> 27:00.486
after the hospital was closed
to all ambulance traffic

27:00.519 --> 27:02.321
or because a doctor
took it upon himself

27:02.354 --> 27:06.025
to cut a kid open
with no working ORs?

27:06.058 --> 27:08.427
He wasn't gonna survive
transport, so I made the call.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.329
NOLAN: I'm the attending trauma
surgeon on deck.

27:10.362 --> 27:13.132
I made the decision
to keep him and cut.

27:13.165 --> 27:14.633
He had seconds to live.

27:14.667 --> 27:16.202
At least now he's got
a fighting chance.

27:16.235 --> 27:17.837
But you had no faith
in the first responders

27:17.870 --> 27:19.505
-to keep him alive.
-CONRAD:
I've been a first responder

27:19.538 --> 27:21.507
at a war front, and his wounds
are up there with any

27:21.540 --> 27:22.675
artillery damage I've seen.

27:22.709 --> 27:24.543
He was bleeding out.

27:24.576 --> 27:25.978
He had seconds.

27:26.012 --> 27:27.479
NOLAN:
It's like Niagara Falls in here.

27:27.513 --> 27:29.348
The aortic damage
makes it almost impossible

27:29.381 --> 27:30.549
to stop this bleeding.

27:34.687 --> 27:37.556
Can you use
an extra set of hands?

27:41.527 --> 27:45.965
CONRAD:
Dr. Bell, this is one life.

27:45.998 --> 27:48.567
At the command center,
you're saving many lives.

27:51.003 --> 27:54.006
MAN: Dr. Bell. I-I'm sorry to
interrupt, but this is urgent.

27:54.040 --> 27:55.708
Well, spit it out.

27:55.742 --> 27:57.176
It's not a foreign
cyber crime ring.

27:57.209 --> 27:59.078
The IP address that launched
the malware

27:59.111 --> 28:01.748
came from inside Chastain.

28:01.781 --> 28:03.916
Are you kidding me?
This isn't the storm?

28:03.950 --> 28:05.985
-Are you telling me

28:06.018 --> 28:07.686
we're being attacked
by one of our own?

28:07.720 --> 28:09.722
That's exactly what
I'm telling you.

28:15.061 --> 28:17.329
NURSE: Hey, it's Mabel's dad.
I found him collapsed.

28:17.363 --> 28:18.831
He's been vomiting.

28:18.865 --> 28:20.332
He's weak, disoriented.

28:20.366 --> 28:22.401
I treated him for severe
hypertension earlier.

28:22.434 --> 28:24.336
Jason, have you eaten?

28:24.370 --> 28:26.338
Okay. With his high blood
pressure from this morning,

28:26.372 --> 28:27.573
I'm afraid he's having a stroke.

28:27.606 --> 28:29.508
We need to get him up to CT
for imaging.

28:29.541 --> 28:30.777
All right, I'll handle him here.
You run up to imaging,

28:30.810 --> 28:32.611
force your way to the front
of the line,

28:32.644 --> 28:34.546
-and throw elbows
if you have to.
-Okay, you know I will.

28:34.580 --> 28:35.614
All right.

28:40.219 --> 28:41.587
AUSTIN:
All right.

28:41.620 --> 28:44.090
You are going to be in position
for a long time,

28:44.123 --> 28:47.526
-so I suggest
you get your stretch on.
-MINA: 37 seconds and counting.

28:47.559 --> 28:50.196
Nervous nurse, when you crank,

28:50.229 --> 28:52.031
you are this baby's heart.
You hear me?

28:52.064 --> 28:54.200
You are responsible
for circulating

28:54.233 --> 28:56.368
oxygen-rich blood through all

28:56.402 --> 28:58.737
of her tiny organs, so...

28:58.771 --> 29:00.039
feel the heart.

29:00.072 --> 29:01.874
Be the heart.

29:01.908 --> 29:03.409
Now say it with me.

29:03.442 --> 29:05.144
Feel the heart.

29:05.177 --> 29:06.645
Be the heart.

29:06.678 --> 29:09.115
Louder, so I can believe you.

29:09.148 --> 29:10.917
Feel the heart.
Be the heart.

29:10.950 --> 29:12.785
-Better. Not great.
-MINA: Ten seconds.

29:12.819 --> 29:15.287
AUSTIN:
All right, position for lights.

29:15.321 --> 29:17.723
MINA:
Seven, six,

29:17.756 --> 29:19.959
five, four, three...

29:19.992 --> 29:23.262
Here we go.

29:25.865 --> 29:27.099
Be the heart.

29:27.133 --> 29:29.068
Feel the heart.

29:29.101 --> 29:32.071
Be the heart. Feel the heart.

29:32.104 --> 29:33.639
-Go for perfusion.
-Feel the heart.

29:33.672 --> 29:36.909
Be the heart. Feel the heart.

29:36.943 --> 29:38.110
-Be the heart.
-Suction.

29:38.144 --> 29:40.779
Feel the heart. Be the heart.

29:40.813 --> 29:43.615
Feel the heart.
Be the heart.

29:43.649 --> 29:45.151
A hacker tried to get into our
system before.

29:45.184 --> 29:47.586
-Almost released the worm
a couple months ago.

29:47.619 --> 29:49.088
It's hard to believe that one
of us would do this.

29:50.857 --> 29:53.592
Oh, God, what is that banging?

29:53.625 --> 29:56.262
Come on. Come on.

29:56.295 --> 29:58.597
Linda, need some help?

29:58.630 --> 30:00.666
I am sick of this crap.

30:00.699 --> 30:02.268
My patient needs sedation.

30:02.301 --> 30:04.837
All right.
There's a trick.

30:04.871 --> 30:07.106
You know, when they brought
these computers in,

30:07.139 --> 30:08.340
they said life would be easier.

30:08.374 --> 30:10.009
My day got an hour longer

30:10.042 --> 30:12.011
and I get to spend even less
time with my patients.

30:12.044 --> 30:13.545
NIC:
That works when there's power.

30:13.579 --> 30:15.882
This works
when there's no power.

30:19.051 --> 30:20.452
You've done that before.

30:20.486 --> 30:22.221
Yeah.
Hey, you know what?

30:22.254 --> 30:23.890
Smash all the computerized
do-dads and gizmos.

30:23.923 --> 30:25.824
I won't tell anybody.
Maybe we can actually

30:25.858 --> 30:27.326
start looking people
in the eye again

30:27.359 --> 30:28.895
instead of staring at screens
all the time.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.565
Hey, I'm not bitter.

30:33.599 --> 30:35.334
Yes, I am.

30:35.367 --> 30:36.903
I mean, she's not wrong.

30:36.936 --> 30:38.504
You think she knows
how to write computer code?

30:38.537 --> 30:40.139
NIC:
Definitely not.

30:40.172 --> 30:42.341
You said the hackers
tried to shut us down before.

30:42.374 --> 30:44.510
Do we have dates? I mean,
we can see who was working

30:44.543 --> 30:47.179
on those days and go from there.

30:47.213 --> 30:48.480
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't tell me.

30:48.514 --> 30:50.082
Dr. Pravesh, no more power.

30:50.116 --> 30:51.817
CTs are shut down
until further notice.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.852
-You got to be kidding me.
-Unless you got a generator

30:53.886 --> 30:55.754
-in your pocket.
-Oh, come on.

30:55.787 --> 30:57.823
-Dr. Wilson.
-Make it good, Pravesh.

30:57.856 --> 31:00.526
Blood pressure's been 180/120
all day.

31:00.559 --> 31:03.095
Weak, vomiting, abdominal pain.
Good enough?

31:06.198 --> 31:08.767
Good catch.
Could be a hemorrhagic stroke.

31:08.800 --> 31:11.570
Get him over to Atlanta General
ASAP for a CT to confirm.

31:11.603 --> 31:13.772
I'll call ahead
and have Neuro waiting.

31:13.805 --> 31:14.974
Helipad. Go.

31:16.808 --> 31:18.444
Your wife and children
are in good hands.

31:18.477 --> 31:20.579
We got to get you checked out
before things get worse, okay?

31:20.612 --> 31:23.649
Let's go. Let's go, let's go,
let's go. Come on.

31:26.318 --> 31:28.054
Wait, hold on.

31:30.990 --> 31:32.591
NURSE:
Oh, my God.

31:34.460 --> 31:36.862
-Get me a BP

31:36.895 --> 31:38.230
-and a blood sugar
reading, please.
-Okay.

31:39.665 --> 31:42.301
Squeeze my hands.
Squeeze them.

31:42.334 --> 31:45.104
-We're ready to take off.
-I need just a second.

31:45.137 --> 31:46.638
-Okay. It's okay.
-Okay, smile for me...

31:46.672 --> 31:48.607
Pupil's reactive.

31:48.640 --> 31:49.976
If we don't go now while
there's a break in the weather,

31:50.009 --> 31:51.343
we don't get out.

31:52.278 --> 31:54.947
Blood sugar is 88.

31:54.981 --> 31:57.483
BP... 90/50.

31:57.516 --> 31:59.251
His blood pressure is dropping.
He's not having a stroke.

31:59.285 --> 32:00.886
-He's having an
anaphylactic reaction.

32:00.919 --> 32:03.255
It really looked like a stroke.

32:03.289 --> 32:06.058
It presented with GI symptoms,
so I didn't catch it at first,

32:06.092 --> 32:10.062
-but I'm sure.

32:10.096 --> 32:11.330
He's staying.

32:11.363 --> 32:14.466
-Jason...

32:14.500 --> 32:16.768
Jason, what are your allergies?

32:16.802 --> 32:19.138
Hey! Do you have an epi?

32:23.809 --> 32:27.546
Peanut butter, kale, honey,
broccoli...

32:31.517 --> 32:33.319
It's okay.
It's okay.

32:33.352 --> 32:35.321
-DEVON: Come on, come on.

32:37.689 --> 32:39.491
Mangos.

32:39.525 --> 32:42.694
I'm allergic to mangos.

32:42.728 --> 32:45.097
Second to last ingredient.

32:45.131 --> 32:47.099
NURSE:
Oh, my God.

32:47.133 --> 32:48.800
Jason, you're gonna be okay.

32:52.004 --> 32:54.673
All right. Let's see
what's going on.

32:54.706 --> 32:57.943
Mmm, any good drugs?
Can I get in on the fun?

32:57.976 --> 32:58.977
JOPLIN:
There you go, sister.

32:59.011 --> 33:01.547
Ready to relax
and explore your humanity.

33:03.582 --> 33:04.716
NIC:
Okay...

33:04.750 --> 33:07.019
Hmm.

33:07.053 --> 33:08.254
Is there something wrong?

33:10.356 --> 33:12.391
Joplin, where are the pills
I gave you earlier?

33:12.424 --> 33:14.460
-In my belly.
-Try again,

33:14.493 --> 33:16.462
because you have
an allergy to doxycycline,

33:16.495 --> 33:18.997
and I haven't given you
an antihistamine yet.

33:19.031 --> 33:21.667
And I'm seeing no hives,
no reaction, so...

33:21.700 --> 33:24.203
you clearly
didn't take the pills.

33:24.236 --> 33:26.038
Okay, Nancy Drew.

33:26.072 --> 33:28.574
You're right, I flushed
the antibiotics down the toilet.

33:28.607 --> 33:30.309
What?

33:30.342 --> 33:32.044
I mean, if you're not gonna do
what they say,

33:32.078 --> 33:35.214
why are we even at the hospital?

33:35.247 --> 33:37.483
Joplin, what are you doing

33:37.516 --> 33:38.984
on your phone in the middle
of the night?

33:39.017 --> 33:40.519
Just, like, texting,
Instagramming?

33:40.552 --> 33:42.688
Uh, no. she writes code
for different apps.

33:42.721 --> 33:45.557
It-it doesn't pay much,
but it's something.

33:45.591 --> 33:48.294
What were you studying when you
dropped out of college?

33:50.196 --> 33:52.564
Software engineering at MIT.
What's going on?

33:52.598 --> 33:54.833
JOPLIN: Better question
is why I'm not at MIT anymore.

33:54.866 --> 33:58.370
Answer: hospital bills so
crippling, I had to drop out

33:58.404 --> 34:00.539
and she had to declare
bankruptcy.

34:02.474 --> 34:05.777
Are you faking symptoms
to be here?

34:05.811 --> 34:07.679
Look, we want
less hospital, not more--

34:07.713 --> 34:10.216
why would she
fake her symptoms?

34:10.249 --> 34:12.684
Because I think she hacked
into our system to shut us down.

34:12.718 --> 34:14.220
That's crazy.
Joplin...

34:14.253 --> 34:15.421
This isn't the first time

34:15.454 --> 34:16.522
that someone's hacked
into our computer.

34:16.555 --> 34:18.524
The attacks started on July 4.

34:18.557 --> 34:19.991
You were here then.

34:22.594 --> 34:24.463
Is this true?

34:24.496 --> 34:26.898
Did you do this?

34:26.932 --> 34:29.735
Why would you...

34:29.768 --> 34:31.637
Medical bills ruined us.

34:31.670 --> 34:34.273
Chastain ruined us.
I can't get the job that I want

34:34.306 --> 34:35.541
without the degree from MIT.

34:35.574 --> 34:36.542
We are making it work.

34:36.575 --> 34:38.477
We are barely getting by.

34:38.510 --> 34:40.412
You're working two jobs
in order to make payments

34:40.446 --> 34:42.414
to Chastain for my bill.
And for what?

34:42.448 --> 34:43.649
So the hospital can get rich?

34:43.682 --> 34:46.051
Damn right I hacked
into the billing department.

34:46.084 --> 34:47.619
To get our lives back.
To wipe our slate clean.

34:47.653 --> 34:49.455
Wait, the billing department?

34:49.488 --> 34:51.723
No, your cyber attack
is responsible

34:51.757 --> 34:53.559
for this entire power outage.

34:53.592 --> 34:54.960
That's not possible.
The code I created

34:54.993 --> 34:56.162
was only to wipe out billing.

34:56.195 --> 34:57.629
Whatever you intended,

34:57.663 --> 34:59.765
it did a hell of a lot more
than that.

34:59.798 --> 35:01.500
You severed our connection
to the grid.

35:01.533 --> 35:02.834
You said that was the storm.

35:02.868 --> 35:04.102
We were wrong.

35:04.136 --> 35:06.338
Well, I-I messed up.

35:06.372 --> 35:07.339
-It must've rep...
-People's lives

35:07.373 --> 35:09.308
are in danger because of you.

35:10.276 --> 35:12.110
I... I-I can try to fix it.

35:12.144 --> 35:13.312
Let me try to fix it.

35:21.687 --> 35:24.623
If she can fix this, do you have
to tell anyone what happened?

35:24.656 --> 35:26.792
You saw the damage
her virus caused.

35:26.825 --> 35:29.127
Joplin's a good person
who did something stupid.

35:29.161 --> 35:30.696
Young people do dumb stuff.

35:30.729 --> 35:32.364
I hear you,
but right now let's just focus

35:32.398 --> 35:34.800
on getting the hospital
back up and running again.

35:34.833 --> 35:37.135
Look, I know I'm asking
for too much, but...

35:37.169 --> 35:39.805
so far, no one's
gotten hurt, right?

35:40.839 --> 35:42.841
We are barely surviving
as it is.

35:42.874 --> 35:44.876
I honestly don't know how...

35:44.910 --> 35:46.612
Please, I know this is bad...

35:46.645 --> 35:48.514
Here. Uh, i-it's a full backup

35:48.547 --> 35:50.449
of-of the hospital computers
I made

35:50.482 --> 35:52.518
before I did
what I should've never done.

35:52.551 --> 35:54.620
A-All hackers make 'em, in case.

35:54.653 --> 35:56.255
Give it to I.T.
They'll know what to do.

35:57.889 --> 36:00.892
I deserve whatever
happens to me, but

36:00.926 --> 36:02.561
Rachel didn't know anything.

36:02.594 --> 36:03.895
Make sure they know that.

36:03.929 --> 36:06.198
And that I'm sorry.
I really am.

36:08.200 --> 36:09.935
I'll pass that on.

36:13.038 --> 36:15.407
:
God. I'm sorry.

36:15.441 --> 36:18.076
-Sorry...
-Don't...

36:18.109 --> 36:20.011
I gave the drive to I.T.
Power's being restored now.

36:20.045 --> 36:21.713
But Bell doesn't
need to know that yet.

36:21.747 --> 36:23.415
No, we're gonna lie
to help Joplin out.

36:23.449 --> 36:25.751
I like that way you think.
I'm in.

36:25.784 --> 36:29.054
We can get you the antidote
to the malware.

36:29.087 --> 36:31.323
The person is remorseful
and asking for leniency

36:31.357 --> 36:32.324
before they hand it out.

36:32.358 --> 36:33.559
Blackmail?

36:33.592 --> 36:34.926
Let's just call it negotiating.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.595
Well, what are we talking about?

36:36.628 --> 36:38.364
A nurse demanding
more mental health days?

36:38.397 --> 36:41.099
Some millennial intern's crusade

36:41.132 --> 36:42.734
for more acai bowls
in the cafeteria?

36:42.768 --> 36:44.035
NIC:
A patient

36:44.069 --> 36:45.937
whose life was destroyed
by Chastain.

36:45.971 --> 36:47.205
And a PR nightmare.

36:47.239 --> 36:48.874
Don't need another one of those.

36:48.907 --> 36:50.276
Chastain's computers
were vulnerable.

36:50.309 --> 36:53.178
-Our generators
weren't up to code.
-Not my fault.

36:53.211 --> 36:54.880
-Press won't see it that way.
-Patients' lives

36:54.913 --> 36:56.748
were in jeopardy. It's unlikely
they'll put the blame

36:56.782 --> 36:58.417
on Charles the I.T. guy.

36:58.450 --> 37:00.519
What is it with you two?

37:00.552 --> 37:02.120
Sticking your necks out
for some patient

37:02.153 --> 37:03.622
you just met a few hours ago.

37:03.655 --> 37:05.056
Seriously?

37:05.090 --> 37:07.359
Chastain shined during

37:07.393 --> 37:09.428
a crippling power outage
likely caused

37:09.461 --> 37:11.863
-by...

37:11.897 --> 37:13.399
...bad weather.

37:13.432 --> 37:16.234
NIC:
And a young patient's life

37:16.268 --> 37:18.103
isn't completely ruined.

37:18.136 --> 37:21.540
That's a win-win.

37:21.573 --> 37:24.142
Well, nice try, but hacking
into a hospital database,

37:24.175 --> 37:25.644
cutting off its power,

37:25.677 --> 37:27.178
endangering countless lives...

37:28.614 --> 37:30.382
I need a name.

37:30.416 --> 37:31.950
We're not asking for anonymity.

37:31.983 --> 37:34.286
We're just asking for leniency.

37:37.923 --> 37:39.558
Well...

37:39.591 --> 37:41.393
handling this quickly
and quietly

37:41.427 --> 37:43.595
is in everyone's best interest.

37:43.629 --> 37:46.932
So, deal?

37:47.966 --> 37:49.100
Yeah.

37:54.706 --> 37:56.642
AUSTIN: Wait for it.

37:56.675 --> 38:00.011
Wait for it...

38:01.680 --> 38:02.748
Ah.

38:02.781 --> 38:04.483
And then there was light,

38:04.516 --> 38:07.486
and he saw that it was good.

38:09.955 --> 38:12.924
NOLAN:
We saved that kid's life.

38:12.958 --> 38:14.593
He's gonna make it, by the way.

38:14.626 --> 38:16.595
You sure you're gonna make it?

38:16.628 --> 38:18.664
That improv surgery is the
craziest thing I've ever done

38:18.697 --> 38:20.932
in my life. I mean, I don't know
whether to thank you

38:20.966 --> 38:22.934
or to punch you.

38:22.968 --> 38:24.936
Hey, I carried a fully-grown man

38:24.970 --> 38:26.772
up three flights
of stairs today.

38:26.805 --> 38:28.640
And you're telling me this why?

38:28.674 --> 38:30.642
Because I broke a sweat

38:30.676 --> 38:33.979
and you know where
there's a secret shower.

38:37.215 --> 38:39.184
Dr. Benjamin's office.
You earned these today.

38:39.217 --> 38:42.954
But... you didn't
get 'em from me.

38:42.988 --> 38:44.656
You have my word.

38:47.025 --> 38:49.928
You do know Benjamin
is back in the office now?

38:54.366 --> 38:56.602
Good.

38:59.505 --> 39:01.039
: Uh,
what happened in the elevator

39:01.072 --> 39:02.641
stays in the elevator.

39:02.674 --> 39:06.211
Not something
I'd want to advertise.

39:06.244 --> 39:07.513
Right.

39:11.417 --> 39:12.551
DEVON:
Looks good.

39:14.453 --> 39:17.355
Make sure he takes it easy
for the next few days.

39:17.389 --> 39:19.591
Not sure that's how
this new-dad thing works.

39:19.625 --> 39:21.159
I've got my eye on him.

39:21.192 --> 39:22.193
I'll keep him in line.

39:23.228 --> 39:25.196
Uh, thank you, Dr. Pravesh.

39:25.230 --> 39:27.198
We can't...
can't thank you enough.

39:27.232 --> 39:30.436
Mr. and Mrs. Thoms, someone here
is excited to see you.

39:35.407 --> 39:37.543
MINA:
Your daughter's a warrior.

39:37.576 --> 39:39.077
AUSTIN:
We repaired her heart,

39:39.110 --> 39:41.580
and it's even stronger
than we expected.

39:44.215 --> 39:45.517
MINA:
How long has he been crying?

39:45.551 --> 39:47.919
Since they took Mabel
for surgery.

39:47.953 --> 39:49.921
Nothing we've tried
has calmed him.

39:56.094 --> 39:59.064
I have an idea.

39:59.097 --> 40:03.068
Until today,
these babies shared a womb.

40:03.101 --> 40:07.405
They don't know an existence
without the touch of the other.

40:07.439 --> 40:10.408
And then they were thrust
into a huge, cold world,

40:10.442 --> 40:12.077
alone.

40:14.112 --> 40:16.515
They missed each other.

40:18.016 --> 40:21.419
Everything's gonna be A-OK.

40:24.990 --> 40:26.825
I don't think it's working.

40:26.858 --> 40:30.629
-Give it a moment.
-* You are my sunshine *

40:30.662 --> 40:35.066
* My only sunshine *

40:35.100 --> 40:39.070
* You make me happy *

40:39.104 --> 40:42.741
* When skies are gray *

40:42.774 --> 40:47.078
* You'll never know, dear *

40:47.112 --> 40:51.016
* How much I love you *

40:51.049 --> 40:54.252
* Please don't take *

40:54.285 --> 40:58.356
* My sunshine away *

41:10.836 --> 41:15.206
* The other night, dear *

41:15.240 --> 41:19.144
* As I lay sleeping *

41:19.177 --> 41:21.580
How's the baby?

41:22.581 --> 41:25.216
Resting comfortably.

41:25.250 --> 41:27.619
How are you?

41:27.653 --> 41:29.555
* When I awoke, dear *

41:29.588 --> 41:31.389
Feels like I'm never
getting out of here.

41:31.422 --> 41:35.961
* I was mistaken *

41:35.994 --> 41:39.531
* So I hung my head *
