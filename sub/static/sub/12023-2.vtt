00:01.082 --> 00:03.919
Male narrator: Tonight
on Ice Road Truckers...

00:06.964 --> 00:09.131
Yeah, it's Alaska, baby.

00:09.133 --> 00:12.401
Narrator: It's judgment day
for the Dalton newcomers.

00:12.403 --> 00:13.869
The south's invading, son.

00:13.871 --> 00:15.304
'Cause he's a fucking prick.

00:15.306 --> 00:18.140
Oh, fuck.

00:18.142 --> 00:22.044
Narrator: - On the winter roads...
- Holy fuck.

00:22.046 --> 00:23.913
Narrator: Rick loses it.

00:23.915 --> 00:26.949
Can someone explain where
in the fuck I'm going?

00:26.951 --> 00:30.019
Narrator: - And Alex...
- Why did I think I saw the town?

00:30.021 --> 00:30.753
Like, what happened to it?

00:30.755 --> 00:33.389
Narrator: Rolls the
dice on Arctic ice.

00:33.391 --> 00:34.657
Anybody got a copy?

00:34.659 --> 00:41.030
Up here, you can easily
die by yourself.

01:14.597 --> 01:21.537
Narrator: In Manitoba, Canada...
[Truck horn blasts]

01:21.539 --> 01:25.374
Record-high temperatures have
turned the winter roads into an

01:25.376 --> 01:32.715
unforgiving swamp of slush...
and thin ice.

01:38.355 --> 01:39.655
That was a good bump.

01:39.657 --> 01:41.957
I love it.

01:41.992 --> 01:48.597
Narrator: And 200 miles north
of Winnipeg... [chuckles]

01:48.631 --> 01:53.635
Narrator: Hugh and Rick
are in the thick of it.

01:53.637 --> 01:57.606
So rough, my truck
pops out of gear.

01:57.608 --> 02:00.242
Narrator: - This season...
- Boy, this is stupid.

02:00.244 --> 02:01.877
10-4.

02:01.879 --> 02:08.150
Narrator: - Hugh is sharing in
Polar's profits... - Fuck.

02:08.184 --> 02:11.520
That's how you
do it right there.

02:11.554 --> 02:16.859
Narrator: While Rick is driving
as a first-time truck owner.

02:16.861 --> 02:19.495
Yeah-heah!

02:19.497 --> 02:30.406
Narrator: But so far...
their season's been more crash than cash.

02:30.408 --> 02:33.409
What we're doing this year is a lot
more dangerous than any other year.

02:33.411 --> 02:34.476
The roads haven't
even hardened.

02:34.478 --> 02:36.211
Like, they haven't
even packed up yet.

02:36.213 --> 02:37.579
[Truck horn blasts]

02:37.581 --> 02:41.216
Narrator: - And after two brutal days...
- Holy crap.

02:41.218 --> 02:42.951
Are we here?

02:42.953 --> 02:47.222
Got to be getting close.

02:47.224 --> 02:51.193
Narrator: The end
is almost in sight.

02:51.195 --> 02:56.465
Smooth sailing
from here on out.

02:56.467 --> 03:03.672
Narrator: - But up ahead...
- That's a fucking nightmare.

03:03.674 --> 03:07.109
Holy fuck.

03:07.111 --> 03:11.613
Narrator: What should be
a 300-yard ice crossing...

03:11.615 --> 03:14.450
You're gonna get rough in here.

03:14.452 --> 03:18.487
Narrator: Looks more
like an open river.

03:18.489 --> 03:21.757
[Sighs]

03:21.759 --> 03:24.126
This is not ice road
trucking anymore.

03:24.128 --> 03:30.099
This is kind of like
suicidal trucking.

03:30.101 --> 03:33.635
Narrator: But with their payday
waiting on the other side...

03:33.637 --> 03:35.938
We ain't got time
to sit around here.

03:35.940 --> 03:41.944
Narrator: Hugh tests the ice
with 14,000 pounds of steel.

03:41.946 --> 03:43.078
Okay.

03:43.080 --> 03:49.651
We're just going into
the fucking water here.

04:29.993 --> 04:33.795
[Chuckles]

04:33.797 --> 04:34.796
Okay, I'm across 'er.

04:34.798 --> 04:37.166
Come on over.

04:37.168 --> 04:42.971
Narrator: With a foot of
water covering the crossing...

04:42.973 --> 04:50.078
Rick's got no way to know
if the ice is still solid.

04:50.080 --> 04:52.080
Here we go.

04:59.489 --> 05:00.689
I don't even have ice to run on.

05:00.691 --> 05:02.324
I'm going through a lake.

05:02.358 --> 05:05.127
Hammer down.

05:09.232 --> 05:13.435
Enjoying the ice road
truck today, partner?

05:13.437 --> 05:15.437
10-4.

05:45.301 --> 05:50.973
Oh, yeah.

05:50.975 --> 05:52.708
[Truck horn blasts]

05:52.710 --> 05:55.711
Well, I got to say, that's the
first time I've ever run

05:55.713 --> 05:58.146
open water at the
start of a season.

05:58.148 --> 05:59.481
Put my fucking cowboy hat on.

05:59.483 --> 06:03.418
This is a fucking truck rodeo
if I've ever been in one.

06:03.420 --> 06:05.520
Yee-haw!

06:05.522 --> 06:08.924
[Laughs]

06:08.958 --> 06:13.562
Narrator: 1,600 miles to the northwest...
[Dogs barking]

06:13.564 --> 06:18.500
They pack it in there fairly tight...
to save it from falling over.

06:18.534 --> 06:23.605
Narrator: Alex Debogorski is loading
up for his deadliest mission yet.

06:23.607 --> 06:25.340
Load her to the max.

06:25.342 --> 06:26.842
We're done.

06:26.844 --> 06:30.412
Narrator: - Yesterday...
- Giddyup. Let's go.

06:30.414 --> 06:35.684
Narrator: He defied the odds,
surviving the deadly Dempster...

06:35.686 --> 06:37.519
Whoa, boy.

06:37.521 --> 06:42.291
Narrator: To bring
emergency supplies to Inuvik.

06:42.293 --> 06:44.393
I think we're ready to go.

06:44.395 --> 06:47.763
Narrator: But today he's
heading even further north to

06:47.765 --> 06:51.667
resupply the native
village of Tuktoyaktuk.

06:51.669 --> 06:53.702
Sink or swim.

06:53.704 --> 06:59.608
Narrator: Alex will leave
solid ground behind...

06:59.610 --> 07:04.813
And drive onto the arctic ocean,
a place where shifting ice

07:04.815 --> 07:14.122
crushes ships...
and stranded souls can freeze to death.

07:14.124 --> 07:17.326
This is most of the store's
supply for the whole year.

07:17.328 --> 07:21.129
The person who owns the store has
been waiting for it for a while.

07:21.131 --> 07:24.399
And if he doesn't get the supply
before the ice goes out,

07:24.401 --> 07:26.501
he's gonna be out of business.

07:26.503 --> 07:30.072
Narrator: Weighed down with
nearly 30,000 pounds of cargo...

07:30.074 --> 07:31.940
Whoa, baby.

07:31.942 --> 07:37.212
Narrator: Alex
eases onto the ice.

07:41.050 --> 07:43.051
Ice cracking.

07:43.053 --> 07:43.852
[Cracking ice]

07:43.854 --> 07:48.390
Nice and easy.

07:48.392 --> 07:51.493
And every time you go on ice,
there's potential for problems.

07:51.495 --> 07:56.732
If the ice breaks, you
can end up in the water.

08:06.476 --> 08:11.580
There's something up here.

08:11.582 --> 08:16.485
This is a truck that's-- has
sunk through the ice.

08:16.487 --> 08:21.590
And there it sits, froze in.

08:26.963 --> 08:32.100
Can you imagine the panic that the
driver had when he went through?

08:37.073 --> 08:40.509
Well, that's a reminder to all
those people that say that

08:40.510 --> 08:41.743
trucks never go through the ice.

08:41.745 --> 08:44.011
No, they never go through.

08:44.014 --> 08:45.046
Well, there you are.

08:45.048 --> 08:50.352
There's another one that
never went through.

08:50.386 --> 08:56.925
Up here, you can easily
die by yourself.

08:56.927 --> 09:03.198
Narrator: - 480 miles to the
southwest in Alaska... - Got her!

09:03.200 --> 09:06.668
Narrator: Carlile's in the
middle of a massive project--

09:06.670 --> 09:13.909
to move a 3 1/2 million-pound
oil rig to Prudhoe Bay.

09:13.911 --> 09:18.180
And it's brought new faces to the
Dalton, hoping to cash in on

09:18.182 --> 09:22.017
the extra workload.

09:22.019 --> 09:25.754
- In the office...
- How'd it go?

09:25.756 --> 09:28.089
I mean, we got our first
trip out of the way.

09:28.124 --> 09:28.857
Yup.

09:28.859 --> 09:32.194
Narrator: It's cocky
newcomer Darrell Ward.

09:32.196 --> 09:40.035
On the road... the Montana log
hauler strutted his stuff.

09:40.037 --> 09:42.304
I'm the best fucker out here.

09:42.306 --> 09:46.208
Narrator: But his
attitude raised eyebrows.

09:46.210 --> 09:51.179
I will guarantee you, if you say
that too much, it's gonna bite you.

09:51.181 --> 09:57.352
Narrator: And now his future with
Carlile is in the hands of the boss.

09:57.354 --> 10:00.255
Sounds like there were a
few challenges out there.

10:00.257 --> 10:05.694
You know, one thing I noticed,
you're really-- you're really cocky.

10:05.696 --> 10:07.896
I don't like the-- the
arrogance there.

10:07.898 --> 10:08.763
It's a big concern.

10:08.765 --> 10:10.999
Right.

10:11.001 --> 10:12.868
These guys are
watching your ass.

10:12.870 --> 10:14.169
They're watching you.

10:14.171 --> 10:19.875
And you're overconfident,
they're not gonna like it.

10:19.877 --> 10:22.544
Really it's
decision time, Tony.

10:22.612 --> 10:25.280
Well, I felt real comfortable
with the way he was driving, so,

10:25.282 --> 10:28.283
as far as I'm concerned,
he's good, man.

10:28.317 --> 10:30.418
He's ready to go.

10:30.420 --> 10:32.487
Okay, we're gonna
let you go here.

10:32.489 --> 10:33.722
We're gonna put
you on the road.

10:33.724 --> 10:37.158
Don't get too arrogant or too
cocky out there, because that's

10:37.160 --> 10:38.527
what gets guys in trouble.

10:38.529 --> 10:40.161
Good luck out there.

10:40.163 --> 10:41.696
Glad to have you aboard.

10:41.698 --> 10:42.898
All right. Thanks, Lane.

10:42.900 --> 10:45.433
Good job, man.

10:45.435 --> 10:46.801
I smoked it.

10:46.836 --> 10:49.638
Lane seemed very happy to
hear what Tony had to say.

10:49.672 --> 10:54.709
All I got was good raves.

10:54.711 --> 10:58.847
Narrator: Darrell's joining the
rig move with a 35,000-pound

10:58.849 --> 11:02.150
pump motor on his
first solo run.

11:02.152 --> 11:05.921
They turned me loose, so I'm
running solo now, which is the

11:05.923 --> 11:09.524
way I want it.

11:09.526 --> 11:13.128
If a guy like that comes up here
and can't really get over himself...

11:13.130 --> 11:15.063
[Truck horn blasts]

11:15.065 --> 11:17.866
Then he'll be back in
Montana hauling logs.

11:17.868 --> 11:22.704
Narrator: While one
driver's training is over...

11:22.706 --> 11:26.975
Another is in over his head.

11:26.977 --> 11:33.682
Yesterday... Ronald "Porkchop" Mangum's
training run went downhill fast.

11:33.684 --> 11:35.617
- Holy-- - Whoa,
watch it, watch it.

11:35.619 --> 11:37.619
Move back to the center.

11:37.621 --> 11:38.753
Ah, you're done driving.

11:38.755 --> 11:40.522
Pull over.

11:40.524 --> 11:45.594
Narrator: And now it's
his turn to face the boss.

11:45.596 --> 11:51.333
Sounds like we had a...
interesting trip.

11:51.335 --> 11:54.436
It did get pretty ugly.

11:54.470 --> 11:59.074
And the biggest thing that I
have a concern with is your

11:59.076 --> 12:06.948
attention to what you're doing
is pretty easily distracted.

12:06.983 --> 12:08.783
I struggled because I'm
not used to the truck.

12:08.785 --> 12:11.319
It's a new truck on me.

12:11.321 --> 12:13.555
You know, I understand you're
trying to get used to the truck,

12:13.557 --> 12:18.660
but I was kind of waiting for
you to improve on your own.

12:18.694 --> 12:22.230
I'm here to take my criticism
and learn what I can.

12:22.264 --> 12:25.700
I'm doing this for me and my
family so we can have something.

12:25.702 --> 12:26.701
I know your story, okay?

12:26.703 --> 12:27.869
We talked.

12:27.871 --> 12:30.405
I feel for you, but
look at it this way.

12:30.407 --> 12:33.108
If you leave here, and I'm not
100% sure that you're going to

12:33.110 --> 12:37.746
be back here in two days, then
I'm not gonna let you go.

12:37.748 --> 12:41.049
Yes, sir.

12:41.051 --> 12:43.518
Narrator: - Coming up...
- Can someone explain where in

12:43.520 --> 12:44.953
the fuck I'm going?

12:44.955 --> 12:48.123
Narrator: - And later...
- A little stress level going on.

12:48.125 --> 12:50.592
Narrator: A reality check.

12:50.594 --> 12:51.860
Oh, fuck!

12:54.431 --> 12:57.767
Narrator: - In Fairbanks, Alaska...
- If you leave here, and I'm

12:57.769 --> 13:02.005
not 100% sure that you're gonna
be back here in two days, then

13:02.007 --> 13:05.108
I'm not gonna let you go.

13:05.142 --> 13:07.410
Yes, sir.

13:07.412 --> 13:10.446
Narrator: Porkchop's fate
rests in the hands of Carlile

13:10.448 --> 13:14.484
manager Lane Keator and
trainer Phil Kromm.

13:14.486 --> 13:22.392
Overall, I wasn't seeing
improvement on technique.

13:25.829 --> 13:29.599
I wouldn't feel comfortable
signing my name to an

13:29.601 --> 13:33.102
authorization at this point.

13:37.441 --> 13:38.541
What do you think about Tony?

13:38.543 --> 13:43.780
If you want to continue, a
second opinion is definitely a

13:43.782 --> 13:46.215
minimum at what's
warranted here.

13:46.217 --> 13:49.018
Okay.

13:49.020 --> 13:50.653
This is what we're
gonna do, okay?

13:50.655 --> 13:52.388
I'm gonna put you out
there with Tony.

13:52.390 --> 13:54.457
You're gonna make one
more trip up the road.

13:54.459 --> 13:57.260
And if we can make this work,
then we'll make it work.

13:57.262 --> 14:04.567
If we can't make it work...
We'll give you a ride to the airport.

14:04.569 --> 14:06.002
That's pretty nerve-racking.

14:06.004 --> 14:10.006
Was kind of a little more
brutal than I expected.

14:10.008 --> 14:13.209
Hopefully, he comes through this
and he gets it figured out.

14:13.211 --> 14:15.078
This is a different
game up here.

14:15.080 --> 14:20.450
Not only is his life at stake, so is
everybody else's, including mine.

14:20.484 --> 14:22.218
I'll be damned if I'm gonna
let one safety coordinator

14:22.220 --> 14:24.520
decide on my future.

14:24.555 --> 14:26.989
They're gonna give me one more chance,
and if I do it, then I do it.

14:26.991 --> 14:32.595
If I don't, then I go home.

14:32.597 --> 14:37.967
Narrator: - 250 miles north...
- All right, here you go, man.

14:37.969 --> 14:40.236
Thank you. Thanks.

14:40.238 --> 14:44.207
Narrator: Veteran Jack Jessee
is mentoring Austin Wheeler, a

14:44.209 --> 14:47.210
driver nearly half his age.

14:47.244 --> 14:48.811
Feeling a little
anxious to get going?

14:48.813 --> 14:51.214
Yeah, tired of waiting around.

14:51.248 --> 14:52.815
Well, we got to wait for
everybody else to head out

14:52.817 --> 14:55.685
because we're oversized.

14:55.687 --> 14:57.253
Just hanging out till
everyone else leaves?

14:57.255 --> 14:58.054
Yeah.

14:58.056 --> 14:59.255
Just make sure it's good.

14:59.257 --> 15:01.124
You sure you want to do that?

15:01.126 --> 15:02.425
Oh, yeah.

15:02.427 --> 15:04.994
That's years of
experience right there.

15:04.996 --> 15:07.964
Narrator: Last night...
high winds threatened their

15:07.966 --> 15:11.267
oversized rig loads.

15:11.269 --> 15:13.803
Whoa.

15:13.805 --> 15:17.006
Narrator: But Jack's call to
stop at Coldfoot left Austin in

15:17.008 --> 15:19.242
a foul mood.

15:19.244 --> 15:22.612
I'm not making any
money sitting here.

15:22.614 --> 15:26.716
I had Austin over here
chomping at the bit to go, but

15:26.718 --> 15:29.252
being first isn't
always the best.

15:29.254 --> 15:30.786
This pisses me off.

15:30.788 --> 15:33.990
We started out first yesterday,
and now we're last.

15:34.057 --> 15:36.225
Hopefully, we can get going.

15:36.227 --> 15:39.929
Tired of waiting around.

15:39.963 --> 15:44.600
Narrator: As other drivers clear the yard...
[Truck horn blasts]

15:44.602 --> 15:49.038
All Austin can do is watch.

15:55.445 --> 15:57.947
[Sighs]

15:57.949 --> 16:00.149
You want to back up here a bit?

16:00.151 --> 16:02.518
And we'll be rolling out.

16:02.520 --> 16:04.387
Okay.

16:10.027 --> 16:16.232
We're finally leaving Coldfoot
and getting back on the road.

16:16.234 --> 16:18.501
[Truck horn blasts]

16:18.503 --> 16:23.272
I got my Mountain Dew and my beef
jerky, we're on the road again.

16:23.274 --> 16:26.375
Things are looking up.

16:26.377 --> 16:34.250
Narrator: But up ahead...
is 4,800-foot Atigun Pass...

16:34.252 --> 16:42.725
where one mistake...
could be a driver's last.

16:42.727 --> 16:45.895
Well, considering the weather
they had, guaranteed at least

16:45.897 --> 16:46.996
one set on this.

16:46.998 --> 16:49.232
[Truck horn blasts]

16:49.234 --> 16:49.999
There's a big one.

16:50.001 --> 16:51.434
We're gonna have
to put iron on?

16:51.436 --> 16:55.438
Fuck.

16:59.743 --> 17:03.045
Narrator: Jack quickly
chains up for the climb.

17:03.047 --> 17:06.616
Done deal.

17:06.617 --> 17:09.618
[Grunts]

17:09.621 --> 17:12.788
Narrator: - But the kid...
- Fuck.

17:12.790 --> 17:14.357
Narrator: Is
running into trouble.

17:14.358 --> 17:19.262
This is bullshit.

17:19.263 --> 17:22.964
Why are my fucking
chains broke?

17:22.967 --> 17:24.700
Oh, fuck!

17:24.702 --> 17:26.068
Probably don't need fucking

17:26.069 --> 17:30.006
chains for this hill anyways.

17:30.008 --> 17:34.877
Uh-oh.

17:34.879 --> 17:37.847
Just got a bent link I
just need to fix real quick.

17:37.849 --> 17:39.115
Care if I borrow your pliers?

17:39.117 --> 17:41.684
I don't have-- somebody
took mine in Kenai.

17:41.686 --> 17:42.918
I don't have 'em.

17:42.920 --> 17:44.687
How did you-- how did
you bend your link?

17:44.689 --> 17:45.488
I don't fucking know.

17:45.490 --> 17:47.556
They're old chains.

17:47.558 --> 17:50.192
You didn't try
'em out beforehand?

17:50.194 --> 17:50.860
No, I did.

17:50.862 --> 17:54.130
Must have bent 'em last night
or yesterday or something.

17:54.132 --> 17:58.034
Oh.

17:58.036 --> 18:00.836
Just 'cause you have chains on
your truck, that doesn't mean

18:00.838 --> 18:03.472
they're good to go.

18:03.474 --> 18:07.143
You need to make sure your
chains are good for this road.

18:10.714 --> 18:14.216
These are old and worn out.

18:18.288 --> 18:20.656
Those chains are rusty.

18:20.658 --> 18:26.095
Put a little squeeze through.

18:26.097 --> 18:29.665
[Grunts]

18:29.667 --> 18:31.567
There we go.

18:31.569 --> 18:32.568
Fixed.

18:32.570 --> 18:35.938
Let's put this stuff
up and get going.

18:35.940 --> 18:38.274
Narrator: After
Jack's veteran touch...

18:38.276 --> 18:41.711
Okay, we are starting to roll
from the bottom of the shelf.

18:41.713 --> 18:43.512
10-4.

18:43.514 --> 18:46.649
Narrator: The convoy
is back in business.

18:46.651 --> 18:50.186
[Truck horn beeps]

18:50.188 --> 18:51.987
I'm tired of being
Jack's little brother.

18:51.989 --> 18:54.190
That's not what I'm here for.

18:54.192 --> 18:56.492
I'm pretty sure they wouldn't
have me in this truck if I

18:56.494 --> 18:58.427
didn't know what I was doing.

18:58.429 --> 19:02.264
It's a little too early right
now to put any kind of grade on

19:02.266 --> 19:05.534
what Austin's doing.

19:05.536 --> 19:08.637
He's got so much more to learn.

19:08.639 --> 19:11.240
[Truck horn blasts]

19:15.011 --> 19:22.418
Narrator: 2,000 miles to the southeast...
[Truck horn blasts]

19:22.420 --> 19:27.256
Hugh and Rick are hoping to
cash in on the short season.

19:27.290 --> 19:29.759
We made 'er to Berens River
here, and we're trying to find

19:29.761 --> 19:30.826
these trailers.

19:30.828 --> 19:35.431
Narrator: But to make dollar
one, they gotta find the loads.

19:35.433 --> 19:38.234
We got the same pinpoint
idea of what we always got.

19:38.236 --> 19:42.338
It's in this town somewhere.

19:42.372 --> 19:43.506
Fuck, don't follow me.

19:43.508 --> 19:46.809
We still don't know
where we're going.

19:46.811 --> 19:49.979
Hey, is that-- We're not going
across that bridge, are we?

19:49.981 --> 19:51.881
That's fucking close.

19:51.883 --> 19:55.184
Well-- fuck.

19:55.186 --> 19:57.186
You all right?

19:57.188 --> 19:58.954
I don't think I'll
make it under that.

19:58.956 --> 19:59.622
Okay, back her up.

19:59.624 --> 20:03.859
We got to get out of here then.

20:03.861 --> 20:06.095
Can someone explain where in the
fuck I'm going, so I don't

20:06.097 --> 20:07.797
have to keep driving
around in circles?

20:07.799 --> 20:10.332
Just maybe.

20:10.334 --> 20:13.335
I have no idea.

20:18.909 --> 20:25.047
I guess we keep driving
around until we find her, eh?

20:25.049 --> 20:26.882
That's gotta be them up there.

20:26.884 --> 20:28.150
By God, there's two fucking

20:28.152 --> 20:32.721
trailers there, so that's
exactly where we're going.

20:32.723 --> 20:35.724
I'll be damned.

20:41.231 --> 20:43.966
Narrator: They finally
track them down.

20:43.968 --> 20:46.869
This one and that one.

20:46.871 --> 20:50.706
Narrator: But after a year
buried in the snow, these

20:50.708 --> 20:52.808
trailers aren't going anywhere.

20:52.810 --> 20:54.677
Oh, you're kidding me.

20:54.679 --> 20:58.714
They're stuck.

20:58.716 --> 21:00.783
You're never gonna
spin that around.

21:00.785 --> 21:01.951
Never.

21:01.953 --> 21:06.889
For fuck sakes.

21:06.891 --> 21:09.892
Fucking nightmare.

21:13.456 --> 21:15.294
Narrator: In Fairbanks, Alaska...

21:19.030 --> 21:20.530
There we go.

21:20.531 --> 21:23.398
Narrator: Porkchop's getting
a rare shot at redemption with

21:23.400 --> 21:27.569
trainer Tony Molesky.

21:27.571 --> 21:30.005
A lot of guys don't take the
time to crawl under the trailer.

21:30.007 --> 21:33.275
I always do, just to
be safe, you know.

21:33.277 --> 21:35.210
St got to meet
Porkchop this morning.

21:35.245 --> 21:38.347
Phil had some concerns on his
driving, so I'm gonna go ahead

21:38.349 --> 21:41.717
and take a second trip with him
and give him an evaluation, see

21:41.719 --> 21:45.220
if he's got what it takes to
make it up and down the road.

21:45.222 --> 21:48.056
Any man can fight, but a man
who's got his back against the

21:48.058 --> 21:51.493
wall's gonna fight ten times
harder to stay alive.

21:51.528 --> 21:54.363
Hopefully, Tony's here
to help me succeed.

21:54.365 --> 21:56.231
I'm happy with
everything if you are.

21:56.233 --> 21:57.566
Absolutely.

21:57.568 --> 22:00.969
Narrator: Today, a
30,000-pound load of pipe is

22:00.971 --> 22:06.942
Porkchop's last chance to prove
he belongs on the haul road.

22:06.944 --> 22:10.179
But before he can get it in gear...
[Knock at door]

22:10.181 --> 22:10.913
Morning.

22:10.915 --> 22:12.748
Morning. Eh?

22:12.782 --> 22:15.117
Don't look at this
as being spanked.

22:15.119 --> 22:17.586
Look at it as this guy's good.

22:17.620 --> 22:19.388
He knows what he's doing.

22:19.390 --> 22:24.927
Lane decided to go ahead and have
Porkchop evaluated again by Tony.

22:24.929 --> 22:28.030
And I don't think
it's gonna happen.

22:28.032 --> 22:34.102
I seen a complete lack of ability,
natural ability, to drive a truck.

22:34.104 --> 22:38.106
Not everybody can just do one
ride-along and then go right into it.

22:38.108 --> 22:39.274
Yeah. That's a fact.

22:39.276 --> 22:44.680
It's all good, man.

22:44.682 --> 22:47.449
All right.

22:47.451 --> 22:52.955
Narrator: With Phil in the rearview mirror...
[Truck horn blasts]

22:52.957 --> 23:01.496
It's Tony's turn to put
Porkchop to the test.

23:01.498 --> 23:04.399
It's obvious to me that you know
where you're at on the road here.

23:04.401 --> 23:06.935
You know, I'm not seeing
any problems at all.

23:06.937 --> 23:09.938
That was a really good start.

23:09.973 --> 23:11.540
All clear up to the north.

23:11.542 --> 23:14.309
That's a big 10-4, buddy.

23:14.311 --> 23:19.748
Keep it between the ditches and
don't mess with the witches, son.

23:19.750 --> 23:22.117
Hey, watch out for that dead
caribou right there on the left.

23:22.119 --> 23:25.821
Look like a lot lizard trolling
for pickles in the parking lot.

23:25.823 --> 23:28.757
A lot what?

23:28.759 --> 23:30.492
South's invading, son.

23:30.494 --> 23:32.127
We're gonna take it over, and
we're gonna show them how we do

23:32.129 --> 23:33.929
it Southern style.

23:33.931 --> 23:35.964
Okay.

23:35.999 --> 23:43.538
Uh... a lot of our guys don't
understand the radio language

23:43.540 --> 23:45.941
that you have.

23:45.943 --> 23:48.844
In order to get proper
information from these drivers

23:48.846 --> 23:51.680
and get the respect that you're
looking for, you're gonna have

23:51.682 --> 23:55.484
to adapt your radio language.

23:55.486 --> 24:00.289
The real truck drivers that
are down south are the truck

24:00.291 --> 24:03.091
drivers who can speak in
that tongue I just spoke in.

24:03.093 --> 24:06.295
Dude, that's, like,
foreign language to us.

24:06.297 --> 24:10.565
Our radio lingo is short and
sweet, for the most part.

24:10.567 --> 24:13.902
Stick with the program and be
straight and to the point.

24:13.904 --> 24:17.606
In order to be successful up
here on this road, you're gonna

24:17.608 --> 24:22.010
have to get through me.

24:22.012 --> 24:26.348
So you need to prove that you
belong here and that you can get

24:26.350 --> 24:28.550
the job done.

24:28.552 --> 24:30.018
I like it when
I'm the underdog.

24:30.020 --> 24:31.687
I like it when my back's
against the wall.

24:31.689 --> 24:34.022
Yeah, well, your back's
definitely against the wall

24:34.024 --> 24:36.725
right here, because it's not
just my trust you have to earn,

24:36.727 --> 24:41.363
it's everybody else
out here on the road.

24:46.302 --> 24:51.907
Narrator: 150 miles to the north...
[Truck horn blasts]

24:51.941 --> 24:55.577
I figure I'll be pulling into
Prudhoe about 2:30 A.M., go grab

24:55.579 --> 24:58.714
myself a backhaul and run
her back to Fairbanks.

24:58.748 --> 25:02.818
Narrator: Montana legend
Darrell Ward is pulling his

25:02.820 --> 25:05.120
first solo load up the Dalton.

25:05.122 --> 25:08.490
I'm just the new guy
on the totem pole.

25:08.492 --> 25:11.860
[Truck horn blasts]

25:11.862 --> 25:15.397
Narrator: So far,
he's made good time.

25:15.399 --> 25:18.533
Coming up on Gobbler's Knob.

25:18.535 --> 25:23.005
Narrator: But up the road,
conditions are changing fast.

25:23.007 --> 25:24.506
A little ice fog in the air.

25:24.508 --> 25:29.711
Kind of knocking the
visibility down a little bit.

25:29.713 --> 25:33.782
I'm gonna blow
right through it.

25:48.197 --> 25:50.599
50 below zero.

25:50.601 --> 25:55.303
The windows are starting
to ice up in here.

25:55.305 --> 25:58.874
A little stress level going on.

26:04.313 --> 26:12.020
About 45 below, my steering starts
to react a little different.

26:19.729 --> 26:24.299
Oh, fuck!

26:24.301 --> 26:28.503
Fuck!

26:28.505 --> 26:33.208
Damn, I come around that corner a
little faster than I thought, man.

26:33.210 --> 26:35.777
Wow, that got a little
Western there, man.

26:35.779 --> 26:41.750
Come down on my brakes, my trailer
slid out from underneath me.

26:41.752 --> 26:43.485
[Whistles]

26:43.487 --> 26:47.289
Yeah, I'm sure glad that...
[Truck horn blasts]

26:47.291 --> 26:50.559
Tony didn't see that happen
on my first solo run.

26:50.561 --> 26:55.397
I don't think he'd be too happy
seeing something like that.

26:55.399 --> 26:58.767
I don't like close calls.

27:01.504 --> 27:08.844
Narrator: - 430 miles to the east...
- Watch yourself. Here we go.

27:08.846 --> 27:11.680
Whoa.

27:11.682 --> 27:15.250
Narrator: Alex Debogorski is
driving on the Arctic Ocean...

27:15.252 --> 27:18.653
Look at the hole, how
the ice goes down there.

27:18.655 --> 27:21.957
Narrator: With a year's worth
of supplies for the thousand

27:21.959 --> 27:24.292
residents of Tuktoyaktuk.

27:24.294 --> 27:28.630
It went from being a little
riverboat to an ocean-going vessel.

27:28.632 --> 27:31.032
I'm like Columbus with wheels.

27:31.034 --> 27:36.471
[Laughs]

27:36.473 --> 27:40.475
Narrator: For now,
the ice is holding.

27:40.477 --> 27:45.046
It's sure getting
gray over here.

27:45.081 --> 27:48.416
Narrator: - But up ahead...
- We got a pretty good wind

27:48.418 --> 27:51.186
coming from the left side here,
'cause we got all our-- all our

27:51.188 --> 27:53.488
snow is getting blown east.

27:53.523 --> 27:55.924
Notice how it's getting
whiter and whiter.

27:55.926 --> 27:58.460
We're driving into a whiteout.

27:58.462 --> 28:03.298
Narrator: Arctic whiteouts have
claimed the lives of countless men.

28:08.337 --> 28:13.642
- But with no shelter on the ice...
- The snow turns into the sky.

28:13.644 --> 28:16.578
The sky and the ice become one.

28:16.580 --> 28:21.116
Narrator: Alex has no choice
but to head into the storm.

28:25.154 --> 28:27.122
Maybe say a little prayer.

28:27.124 --> 28:30.926
In the name of the Father and the
Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen.

28:30.928 --> 28:33.662
Thank you, dear God, for all
your blessings and help.

28:33.664 --> 28:35.931
Look after my family.

28:35.933 --> 28:41.369
Please have mercy on all those
that are less fortunate than I.

28:41.371 --> 28:44.472
Amen.

28:44.474 --> 28:48.643
Okay, here's Tuktoyaktuk.

28:57.153 --> 28:59.387
What happened to it?

28:59.389 --> 29:03.191
Well, why did I think
I saw the town?

29:08.965 --> 29:09.664
Radio check.

29:09.666 --> 29:12.367
Anybody got a copy?

29:19.508 --> 29:23.011
You got a copy?

29:23.013 --> 29:25.547
Anybody got a copy?

29:33.186 --> 29:33.819
Radio check.

29:33.821 --> 29:35.921
Anybody gonna copy?

29:35.923 --> 29:39.291
Narrator: Somewhere
on the Arctic Ocean...

29:39.293 --> 29:47.466
Alex Debogorski is driving blind
with a critical load of supplies.

29:47.468 --> 29:51.236
Feels like we drove into
a box of cotton batten.

29:51.238 --> 29:53.839
Can't see a thing right now.

29:53.873 --> 29:55.173
So I don't know where I am.

29:55.175 --> 29:59.978
I'm hoping we're still
south of Tuktoyaktuk.

29:59.980 --> 30:04.583
Narrator: Unsure of his location,
Alex can only keep driving...

30:04.617 --> 30:06.118
You got a copy?

30:06.120 --> 30:08.320
Narrator: And hope
to make contact.

30:08.322 --> 30:11.790
Anybody got a copy?

30:14.961 --> 30:16.295
[Tapping]

30:16.297 --> 30:21.900
Anybody got a copy?

30:21.902 --> 30:23.402
Hey, you copy?

30:23.436 --> 30:25.804
Yes, sir, go ahead for Alex.

30:25.806 --> 30:28.140
Just follow that road and
you'll see me off in the

30:28.142 --> 30:30.275
distance shortly after.

30:30.310 --> 30:33.645
Very good, sir, thank you.

30:33.647 --> 30:37.582
That's the guys we're
bringing the stuff to.

30:37.584 --> 30:38.717
I'm arriving in Tuk.

30:38.719 --> 30:41.753
I'm not lost in
the Arctic Ocean.

30:41.755 --> 30:46.024
Disaster has been
averted again.

30:46.026 --> 30:51.163
Now we just have to find
our way to the store.

30:51.165 --> 30:53.398
And there it is.

30:59.973 --> 31:00.839
Hey.

31:00.841 --> 31:01.540
Alex?

31:01.542 --> 31:02.274
Mr. Pokyak.

31:02.276 --> 31:05.811
- Yeah. Mr. Debogorski...
- Good to see you.

31:05.813 --> 31:09.481
We have some muktuk, cooked
muktuk, compliments of Tuktoyaktuk.

31:09.483 --> 31:11.183
Muktuk, what exactly is it?

31:11.185 --> 31:12.084
It's whale.

31:12.086 --> 31:13.018
Well, I thank you very much.

31:13.052 --> 31:14.186
I really appreciate it.

31:14.188 --> 31:15.921
You're very welcome, and
you have a safe trip home.

31:15.923 --> 31:17.389
And God bless you
and your family.

31:17.391 --> 31:19.391
Thank you.

31:19.393 --> 31:21.660
Every load is important this
time of year because it's

31:21.662 --> 31:23.895
gonna-- you know, the one or
two loads that come in for a

31:23.897 --> 31:27.065
particular business could last
them the whole 11, 12 months

31:27.067 --> 31:28.834
until next year.

31:28.836 --> 31:32.938
Narrator: With the delivery
to Tuktoyaktuk complete...

31:32.940 --> 31:35.207
Hi, guys, what's happening?

31:35.209 --> 31:38.744
Narrator: Alex chalks up his
second load of the season.

31:38.746 --> 31:42.781
We bring food, we bring
groceries, we bring everything.

31:42.783 --> 31:45.083
Sometimes we bring
whole houses.

31:45.085 --> 31:48.787
Whoa!

31:48.789 --> 31:52.657
Narrator: 1,600 miles
to the southeast...

31:52.659 --> 31:55.627
As normal, they tell us this
is going on down south, we get

31:55.629 --> 31:57.229
up here, it's totally fucking

31:57.231 --> 31:58.263
different.

31:58.265 --> 32:01.767
Narrator: Hugh and Rick have
found a loader to help dig out

32:01.769 --> 32:04.436
their stuck trailers.

32:04.438 --> 32:05.437
The trailers are snowed in.

32:05.439 --> 32:06.171
We had to get a loader.

32:06.173 --> 32:09.341
He's gonna plow the road out,
turn the trailers around so we

32:09.343 --> 32:11.109
can get 'em the
fuck out of here.

32:11.111 --> 32:12.577
But it's another typical thing.

32:12.612 --> 32:14.379
You think it's gonna be an
8-hour run, it's not an 8-hour

32:14.381 --> 32:20.852
run, it's a 12-hour
run or a 14-hour run.

32:20.854 --> 32:27.826
Narrator: Hugh's the
first to claim his payload.

32:27.828 --> 32:29.995
Hell, yeah!

32:35.134 --> 32:37.436
I ain't stopping, that's
for fucking sure.

32:37.470 --> 32:38.403
Keep on it, man.

32:38.405 --> 32:40.005
Keep on it.

32:40.007 --> 32:42.040
Hugh's hooked up,
he's out on the road.

32:42.042 --> 32:44.142
I'm just waiting for this trailer
to get spun around, and

32:44.144 --> 32:48.580
I'm gonna try and get
out on the road.

32:48.582 --> 32:53.085
By fucking golly,
here comes mine.

32:53.087 --> 32:54.453
We're in business.

32:54.455 --> 32:56.922
Now I just gotta wait for
Rick to get hooked onto his.

32:56.924 --> 32:59.858
He's right there,
trying her right now.

33:04.864 --> 33:07.165
Oh, are you kidding me?

33:07.167 --> 33:12.671
Narrator: - Rick's in position...
- Fuck!

33:12.673 --> 33:17.175
Narrator: But he's having
trouble pulling it together.

33:19.846 --> 33:25.650
Come on.

33:25.652 --> 33:29.187
For fuck sakes.

33:29.189 --> 33:32.657
In the soft fucking here.

33:32.659 --> 33:35.994
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna have a fucking
show getting this thing out.

33:35.996 --> 33:39.998
Why? What's happening?

33:40.000 --> 33:41.733
Fucking stuck.

33:41.735 --> 33:44.302
Just take it easy.

33:44.304 --> 33:49.274
You got this.

33:49.276 --> 33:50.275
You're doing good.

33:50.277 --> 33:54.980
You got it. You got it.

33:54.982 --> 33:57.983
By golly, I got her.

34:00.921 --> 34:06.291
Narrator: After days battling
the brutal conditions...

34:06.293 --> 34:11.730
Rick's finally underway.

34:11.732 --> 34:13.797
Oh, no!

34:13.800 --> 34:17.835
Narrator: Almost.

34:17.838 --> 34:21.206
Are you fucking kidding me?

34:21.208 --> 34:23.375
Again?

34:27.647 --> 34:28.280
You can pull me out.

34:28.282 --> 34:32.284
I don't mind.

34:50.503 --> 34:53.638
Come on.

34:57.410 --> 34:59.711
Somebody give that loader
guy a bottle of whisky.

34:59.745 --> 35:03.648
You got that right.

35:03.683 --> 35:04.516
Anything else?

35:04.518 --> 35:07.552
No, I think we're good.

35:07.554 --> 35:14.893
Eh... very challenging
trailer pickup to do here.

35:14.895 --> 35:17.629
You're not gonna get anything
easy with the trucking out here.

35:17.631 --> 35:21.633
[Truck horn blasts]

35:27.206 --> 35:32.544
Narrator: 2,000 miles to the northwest...
[Truck horn blasts]

35:32.546 --> 35:34.713
We're just looking at the
lights of Prudhoe here.

35:34.715 --> 35:37.616
It's actually a
very welcome sight.

35:37.618 --> 35:40.118
Narrator: Jack Jessee and
Austin Wheeler have reached

35:40.120 --> 35:45.557
Alaska's North Slope...
with the first pieces of the oil rig.

35:45.625 --> 35:48.994
We both just got a big
one on the load count.

35:48.996 --> 35:52.130
Now we should be dropping this
load off finally, so we can

35:52.132 --> 35:57.102
turn around and try to make
it back to Coldfoot tonight.

35:57.136 --> 36:03.508
Narrator: - After two long days
behind Jack... - Thank God.

36:03.510 --> 36:08.513
Narrator: Austin's eager to get
out from under the veteran's shadow.

36:08.515 --> 36:09.714
How you doing?

36:09.716 --> 36:10.815
Good, sir.

36:10.817 --> 36:12.083
We had a guy break down.

36:12.085 --> 36:12.851
Okay.

36:12.885 --> 36:16.588
So we're gonna have you take the
beavertail down, try to get the truck.

36:16.622 --> 36:19.691
Narrator: The good news is
Austin's got a paying load.

36:19.693 --> 36:24.262
I think Jack's gonna go along and
just kind of help you out there.

36:24.264 --> 36:25.497
Narrator: The bad news...

36:25.499 --> 36:28.500
Jack's still being
sent to supervise.

36:28.502 --> 36:31.803
It's all been worked out.

36:31.805 --> 36:33.934
Tell me that's not fucked up.

36:36.610 --> 36:39.711
I'm just-- I don't want
to do this anymore.

36:39.713 --> 36:41.613
I didn't think it was
gonna be like this.

36:41.615 --> 36:43.715
It's gonna take us forever.

36:43.717 --> 36:47.452
This should be the last time
I convoy with Jack, I hope.

36:47.454 --> 36:49.888
Hey, let's get out of
here before we freeze solid.

36:49.890 --> 36:53.491
This is kinda what Austin does down
in Kenai with his winch truck.

36:53.493 --> 36:57.262
But this ain't Kenai.

36:57.264 --> 37:00.765
He's about to learn a valuable
lesson here, I think.

37:14.148 --> 37:16.382
[Truck horn blasts]

37:16.384 --> 37:19.390
Narrator: 200 miles north of Fairbanks...

37:23.363 --> 37:25.304
Porkchop's in the hot seat.

37:25.339 --> 37:30.930
And the south Carolina native's future
rests with trainer Tony Molesky.

37:30.932 --> 37:31.664
Where are you at?

37:31.666 --> 37:32.365
In eighth right now?

37:32.367 --> 37:33.032
Yeah.

37:33.034 --> 37:34.133
Okay.

37:34.135 --> 37:37.403
Just go right into sixth.

37:37.405 --> 37:41.107
[Gear grinds]

37:41.109 --> 37:44.210
Narrator: - Despite early praise...
- It's obvious to me that you

37:44.212 --> 37:47.747
know where you're at
on the road here.

37:47.749 --> 37:51.584
Narrator: Porkchop's bad habits
are coming back to bite him.

37:51.586 --> 37:53.820
[Gear grinds]

37:53.822 --> 37:56.389
That's pretty harsh.

38:00.694 --> 38:01.361
[Gear grinds]

38:01.363 --> 38:03.363
Damn, dude.

38:03.365 --> 38:04.030
You're scratching gears.

38:04.032 --> 38:09.268
What the hell?

38:09.270 --> 38:13.106
Porkchop, you're kind of hanging
out on a limb right now.

38:13.108 --> 38:19.545
Dude, you can't afford
to have a mistake.

38:19.547 --> 38:21.547
Just pull into Coldfoot.

38:21.549 --> 38:23.282
Take it nice and slow.

38:23.284 --> 38:26.285
Yes, sir.

38:31.025 --> 38:33.993
Just rolled in here
with Porkchop to Coldfoot.

38:33.995 --> 38:36.829
I had to bust his chops a little
bit on a couple of points.

38:36.831 --> 38:40.566
I wasn't shifting
right for him.

38:40.568 --> 38:41.901
That ain't brownie points.

38:41.903 --> 38:44.103
That's plane ticket points.

38:44.105 --> 38:49.575
There's no room for error here.

38:49.577 --> 38:51.477
What up?

38:51.479 --> 38:55.815
Narrator: - While Porkchop refuels...
- How bad was he?

38:55.817 --> 38:59.385
Narrator: Phil Kromm checks
in on his former student.

38:59.387 --> 39:01.721
I knew I handed him
off to you for a reason.

39:01.723 --> 39:05.692
[Both laughing]

39:05.694 --> 39:07.960
The truck was making
some pretty weird noises.

39:07.962 --> 39:08.628
Oh, yeah.

39:08.630 --> 39:10.430
It wasn't cool.

39:10.432 --> 39:13.232
I had to get on
him pretty hard.

39:13.234 --> 39:14.801
He ain't gonna
have a gear left.

39:14.803 --> 39:18.438
That's definitely one of
the things we talked about.

39:18.440 --> 39:20.907
Yeah, he's used to a
different driving style and a

39:20.909 --> 39:22.341
whole different atmosphere.

39:22.343 --> 39:26.746
Well, and that was the reason
for my assessment, is I don't

39:26.748 --> 39:30.717
want to just turn the guy out
that's gonna have major problems.

39:30.719 --> 39:33.252
We just need to make sure that
he's not gonna hurt himself or

39:33.254 --> 39:36.956
anybody else, whether
he makes it or not.

39:36.958 --> 39:37.990
Right. Yup.

39:37.992 --> 39:40.793
Well, this ain't I-5,
that's for sure.

39:40.795 --> 39:44.430
We're just gonna have to see,
see if he can hack it.

39:44.432 --> 39:45.231
Yeah.

39:45.233 --> 39:47.533
You get one chance to
screw up one time out here.

39:47.535 --> 39:49.235
Yeah.

39:49.237 --> 39:55.775
Either he's gonna make it
or he's not, you know.

39:55.777 --> 40:01.147
Narrator: - While one rookie struggles...
- Cold out here!

40:01.149 --> 40:05.318
Narrator: Darrell Ward's
already made it to Prudhoe Bay.

40:05.320 --> 40:06.886
Yeah, it's Alaska, baby!

40:06.888 --> 40:09.522
It's about 50 below
zero out here!

40:09.524 --> 40:14.393
You know, I'm on the clock and
killing time, so I'll go as far

40:14.395 --> 40:19.599
as I can till I run out of hours,
then I'll have to shut her down.

40:21.301 --> 40:24.570
Narrator: And the log
hauler's 31 years of experience

40:24.572 --> 40:31.744
are keeping him
tied for the lead.

40:31.779 --> 40:36.783
- 250 miles to the south...
- I just woke up in Coldfoot.

40:36.785 --> 40:40.553
Got geared up so I can put this
other truck on my scissor neck

40:40.555 --> 40:42.955
lowboy here.

40:42.957 --> 40:48.027
Narrator: After driving overnight...
Austin Wheeler's in Coldfoot

40:48.029 --> 40:52.765
recovering a broken-down
truck, while Jack Jessee...

40:52.767 --> 40:55.034
Better sit over here
where I can watch Austin.

40:55.036 --> 40:57.270
Narrator: Supervises.

40:57.272 --> 40:58.204
He can do it by himself.

40:58.206 --> 41:00.139
It's a one-man job.

41:00.174 --> 41:02.074
What's wrong is the ace of
the haul road is sitting in

41:02.076 --> 41:08.214
there eating breakfast while I'm
out here doing this myself.

41:08.248 --> 41:11.017
Let's see what his
experience shows.

41:11.019 --> 41:14.987
It'd just be nice to have
another person out here.

41:36.810 --> 41:40.646
Fucking Jack Jessee.

41:40.648 --> 41:42.114
I need fucking Jack's help.

41:42.116 --> 41:44.016
This is pissing me off.

41:44.018 --> 41:46.485
Fuck.

41:46.487 --> 41:48.554
He's a fucking prick!

41:48.556 --> 41:52.091
You know, it's his truck,
his cable, his winch.

41:52.093 --> 41:54.026
I think he just needs
to get the job done.

41:54.028 --> 41:57.463
Narrator: Before he can safely
haul the disabled truck...

41:57.465 --> 42:00.800
I need him to help me
steer this on the trailer.

42:00.802 --> 42:06.105
Narrator: Austin has to
center it on the trailer.

42:15.282 --> 42:18.651
[Groans]

42:18.653 --> 42:21.087
That's rookie shit.

42:24.958 --> 42:26.525
Jack doesn't care.

42:26.527 --> 42:29.996
He's cocky, yeah, because
he's the haul road ace.

42:29.998 --> 42:31.697
Pissed off 'cause
I didn't help him.

42:31.699 --> 42:34.533
[Laughs]

42:34.535 --> 42:39.038
Probably doesn't even
want to talk to me.

42:39.040 --> 42:43.075
You know, he's got to learn
to do this on his own.

42:43.077 --> 42:46.145
'Cause, you know, we're not
always gonna be here...

42:46.147 --> 42:48.748
to help him, and this is gonna
be part of his job, being out

42:48.750 --> 42:52.518
by yourself, doing this stuff.

42:52.520 --> 42:54.787
Well, he's a douche bag for
sitting in Coldfoot while I

42:54.789 --> 42:58.057
loaded up the truck by myself.

42:58.059 --> 43:00.393
When you're out on your
own and you're making those

43:00.395 --> 43:04.130
decisions by yourself in the
middle of nowhere, some of those

43:04.132 --> 43:09.135
decisions are life and death.

43:09.137 --> 43:11.237
Jack's fucking full of
himself, and there's a lot of

43:11.239 --> 43:12.672
people that don't like him.

43:12.674 --> 43:14.607
A lot.

43:14.609 --> 43:17.476
Me included now.

43:17.478 --> 43:19.612
This will be my last convoy.

43:19.613 --> 43:21.154
I'm not doing it anymore.

43:24.165 --> 43:26.140
Next time on
Ice Road Truckers...

43:27.839 --> 43:29.940
Hammered down, boy...

43:31.540 --> 43:33.976
As the rig move
deadline approaches...

43:34.708 --> 43:36.141
Son of a bitch.

43:37.019 --> 43:39.363
Reach the breaking point.

43:40.145 --> 43:43.790
I think that it is bullshit that I have
to be Jack's little brother all the time.

43:46.652 --> 43:49.878
Canada's winter roads
shut down the veterans.

43:52.847 --> 43:56.296
And one trucker is not gonna make it.

43:56.801 --> 43:58.036
Holy smokes!

43:58.071 --> 43:59.500
