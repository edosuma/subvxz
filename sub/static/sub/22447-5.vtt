Previously on Andi Mack...

00:05.290 --> 00:06.670
What is your problem?

00:06.670 --> 00:08.380
You're the captain.

00:08.380 --> 00:09.710
Is this how you treat
your teammates?

00:09.710 --> 00:10.920
You'll never know.

00:10.920 --> 00:12.210
Brittany:
You are a genius.

00:12.210 --> 00:14.380
You are the Stephen Hawking
of pressed powder.

00:14.380 --> 00:16.330
You should really consider
doing this for a living.

00:16.330 --> 00:17.380
I do.

00:17.380 --> 00:18.830
I have feelings.

00:18.830 --> 00:20.620
I'm sure you do,

00:20.620 --> 00:22.170
I've just never seen them.

00:22.170 --> 00:23.540
You just have to
get to know me better.

00:23.540 --> 00:26.670
Amber, she came over here
and just started... chatting.

00:26.670 --> 00:28.620
Maybe she wants to be friends.

00:28.620 --> 00:30.920
Why would she ever
want to be friends with me?

00:30.920 --> 00:33.250
Maybe she likes you.
Or maybe...

00:33.250 --> 00:34.880
she still likes you.

00:40.670 --> 00:42.120
Hold still!

00:42.120 --> 00:43.290
It tickles!

00:44.380 --> 00:45.830
I'm almost done.

00:49.880 --> 00:51.210
Whoa!

00:51.210 --> 00:53.420
I look horrible!

00:53.420 --> 00:54.670
Huh.

00:54.670 --> 00:55.960
You're a magician.

00:55.960 --> 00:57.080
Thanks!

00:57.080 --> 00:59.120
It's got to be worth
at least a B+

01:01.880 --> 01:03.500
Yeah.

01:03.500 --> 01:05.460
And next up is?

01:05.460 --> 01:07.540
Old Age Prosthetics.

01:07.540 --> 01:09.380
Then Monsters and Martians

01:09.380 --> 01:11.170
and about a thousand
other things.

01:11.170 --> 01:14.330
And that all leads to finishing
my Cinematic Makeup unit

Great job, Buffy!

Great dish!

03:09.040 --> 03:10.620
That means "assist."

03:12.710 --> 03:15.830
Cyrus, I'm not sure
your cheering's helping.

Maybe we should use
my signs instead.

03:18.500 --> 03:20.750

03:20.750 --> 03:22.710
Yeah, definitely
not that one.

03:22.710 --> 03:24.330
Uh...

03:24.330 --> 03:25.540
how about this one?

03:25.540 --> 03:29.080
"You can't out-tuff

03:29.080 --> 03:30.290

03:36.670 --> 03:37.960
It was such a great game!

03:37.960 --> 03:40.250
I've never had so much
fun watching sports.

03:40.250 --> 03:41.580
I wasn't bored once.

03:41.580 --> 03:43.210
You get bored watching
the Space Otters?

03:43.210 --> 03:45.000
No, of course not.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.500
But there are some times

03:46.500 --> 03:48.380
when you're trying to get
the Frisbee out of a tree

03:48.380 --> 03:50.500
that I get a jump-start
on my homework.

03:50.500 --> 03:53.670
Cyrus, today
was not a good game.

03:53.670 --> 03:55.290
But you won.

03:55.290 --> 03:56.710
That's why we all cheered
at the end, right?

03:56.710 --> 03:57.920
Yeah,

03:57.920 --> 04:00.540
but my whole team made sure
I didn't get to do anything.

04:00.540 --> 04:02.540
But you made that
amazing pass to T.J.

04:02.540 --> 04:04.670
That wasn't a pass.

04:04.670 --> 04:07.250
He stole the ball
right out of my hands.

04:07.250 --> 04:09.290
Oh.

04:10.420 --> 04:11.710
You okay?

04:11.710 --> 04:14.960
Yeah, I think it's just,
uh, baby tater withdrawal.

04:14.960 --> 04:17.750
We gave Amber our order
forever ago.

04:17.750 --> 04:18.920
Well, it is really
busy in here.

04:18.920 --> 04:20.210
Don't defend her!

04:20.210 --> 04:22.000
She's the worst waitress ever.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.080
Okay, I'm gonna go see
what's taking so long.

04:26.120 --> 04:27.750
(sighs)

04:27.750 --> 04:30.920
Look, I just don't wanna
come home if you and Mom
are fighting again.

04:32.290 --> 04:33.880
I don't know, Dad,
I'll find somewhere to stay,

04:33.880 --> 04:35.330
but I can't be around--

04:38.080 --> 04:39.420
Whatever.

04:39.420 --> 04:41.460
I have to go.
I'll see you tomorrow.

04:45.250 --> 04:46.420
I'm sorry.

04:46.420 --> 04:48.920
I didn't mean
to eavesdrop.

04:48.920 --> 04:50.540
What did you hear?

04:50.540 --> 04:51.540
Nothing.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.790
I'm so sorry
your parents are fighting.

04:55.790 --> 04:57.790
Yeah, well...

04:57.790 --> 04:59.380
me, too.

04:59.380 --> 05:02.170
Things haven't been super great
with them lately.

05:04.830 --> 05:06.500
Your baby taters!

05:06.500 --> 05:08.920
Here I am,
talking about my
stupid problems,

05:08.920 --> 05:10.620
and you're just here
for your food.

05:10.620 --> 05:13.710
-Let me--
-Yes, we're hungry,

05:13.710 --> 05:16.290
but, if you wanna talk...

05:23.960 --> 05:26.290
What are they
talking about?

05:26.290 --> 05:28.040
It's obviously not food.

05:29.540 --> 05:31.790
And it's not really
any of our business.

05:31.790 --> 05:33.790
Oh, Jonah,

05:33.790 --> 05:35.880
it's always our business.

05:35.880 --> 05:38.670
Don't worry,
I've been watching videos
on how to lip-read.

05:38.670 --> 05:40.250
Let me take a crack
at this.

05:40.250 --> 05:43.750
Peanuts and applesauce.

05:43.750 --> 05:46.880
The angry rabbits spilled...

05:46.880 --> 05:49.380
marbles on my trampoline.

05:51.210 --> 05:53.670
Hey, I don't move the lips,
I just read 'em.

05:55.620 --> 05:57.040
Here she comes.

06:00.330 --> 06:02.710
So, what was all that about?

06:02.710 --> 06:06.040
I think I just
invited Amber
to sleep over.

06:06.040 --> 06:07.420
What?

06:07.420 --> 06:08.920
Whoa, I was way off.

06:08.920 --> 06:11.000
Well, she's going through
a really hard time

06:11.000 --> 06:13.120
and she needed someplace
to stay tonight.

06:13.120 --> 06:14.670
You're a good person,
Andi Mack.

06:19.710 --> 06:21.880
You are a good person,
Andi Mack.

06:21.880 --> 06:23.500
You're also dumb.

06:23.500 --> 06:25.250
You know you can't
trust her.

06:25.250 --> 06:27.580
She's trying to change.

06:27.580 --> 06:29.420
She wants to be
a better person.

06:29.420 --> 06:31.250
She did seem different.

06:31.250 --> 06:33.210
Andi, have you ever
heard the story

06:33.210 --> 06:34.830
of the frog
and the scorpion?

06:34.830 --> 06:37.330
No, but I bet I'm about to.

06:37.330 --> 06:40.880
A scorpion asks a frog
to carry it across a river
on its back.

06:40.880 --> 06:43.500
"No way, you'll sting me,"
says the frog.

06:43.500 --> 06:45.830
But the Scorpion
promises not to.

06:45.830 --> 06:47.670
So the frog agrees.

06:47.670 --> 06:49.380
Then halfway across the river,

06:49.380 --> 06:51.670
the scorpion stings
the frog anyway,

06:51.670 --> 06:53.580
and they both drown.

06:53.580 --> 06:54.880
What's your point?

06:54.880 --> 06:56.750
My point is...

06:56.750 --> 06:58.540
once a scorpion,

06:58.540 --> 07:00.540
always a scorpion.

07:00.540 --> 07:03.920
I seem to remember
in the last story,
Amber was a snake.

07:03.920 --> 07:05.880
She is a snake.

07:05.880 --> 07:07.620
And she's a scorpion.

07:09.500 --> 07:11.500
She's a "snorpion."

07:14.790 --> 07:15.920
(sighs)

07:21.790 --> 07:23.830
(door opens)

07:23.830 --> 07:25.000
You're here!

07:26.750 --> 07:27.790
You're here?

07:27.790 --> 07:30.380
Hi, Mrs. Mack.
Thank you so much
for having me.

07:30.380 --> 07:31.750
(laughs)
Please...

07:31.750 --> 07:33.330
Mrs. Mack is my mother.

07:33.330 --> 07:34.880
You can call me
Ms. Mack.

07:34.880 --> 07:36.290
And tell me what
you're doing here.

07:36.290 --> 07:38.620
Mom, Amber's
spending the night.

07:38.620 --> 07:39.830
I asked her to.

07:39.830 --> 07:41.710
Seriously?

07:41.710 --> 07:43.790
(whispering)
If this is a hostage situation,

07:43.790 --> 07:46.080
blink twice.

07:46.080 --> 07:48.040
-Mom!
-It's okay,

07:48.040 --> 07:49.420
I get it.

07:49.420 --> 07:52.960
Last time I saw you,
I wasn't in a very good place.

07:52.960 --> 07:55.000
Being with Jonah
made me a little,

07:55.000 --> 07:56.670
well...

07:56.670 --> 07:58.290
you saw.

07:58.290 --> 08:00.040
I was mean.

08:00.040 --> 08:02.790
But I'm not that person
anymore, I promise.

08:02.790 --> 08:04.790
Mm-hmm.

08:04.790 --> 08:06.880
Andy, have you
ever heard the story

08:06.880 --> 08:08.170
about the frog
and the scorpion?

08:08.170 --> 08:09.750
Okay,

08:09.750 --> 08:11.620
we're going to my room now.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.750
Do you ever do crafts?

08:27.580 --> 08:29.000
Not really.

08:31.620 --> 08:33.420
Wanna shop online?

08:33.420 --> 08:35.040
I don't have any money.

08:36.040 --> 08:37.500
Yeah.

08:37.500 --> 08:38.620
Me neither.

08:41.250 --> 08:42.540
(sighs)

Yeah, totally.
Go ahead.

09:57.330 --> 10:00.170
Buffy (over phone):
Oh, no. Amber's started
the cloning process.

10:00.170 --> 10:01.250
(shushing)

10:01.250 --> 10:03.000
It's just a wig, obviously.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Those are the wigs
from your party!

10:05.000 --> 10:07.210
You're letting her play
with the stuff
from your party!

10:07.210 --> 10:09.170
She lost her chance
to do that,

10:09.170 --> 10:11.000
when she ruined
your party.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.920
Guys, be cool.
We're having a good time.

10:15.120 --> 10:16.420
Prove it.

10:18.960 --> 10:20.250
See?

10:20.250 --> 10:22.080
Tell her she can't
pull off the Andi.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.000
That's your
signature look.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.500
And tell her,
if she tries anything--

10:26.500 --> 10:28.880
Okay, thank you. Bye.

10:33.710 --> 10:35.670
(sighs) You heard?

10:35.670 --> 10:37.620
Your room
isn't exactly huge,

10:37.620 --> 10:40.080
and your friends aren't
exactly subtle.

10:40.080 --> 10:40.920
Yeah.

10:42.170 --> 10:44.120
But I did
mean what I said.

10:44.120 --> 10:45.880
I am actually
having a good time.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.880
Me too, actually.

10:52.080 --> 10:53.790
My dad lost his job.

10:53.790 --> 10:56.710
That's why they're fighting,
and why I'm working
at The Spoon.

10:56.710 --> 10:58.210
Oh...

10:58.210 --> 10:59.580
wow.

11:00.670 --> 11:02.460
That sounds really hard.

11:02.460 --> 11:04.540
It's not great.

11:04.540 --> 11:07.170
(sighs)
Amber, I don't even
know what to say.

11:08.210 --> 11:09.620
You already said it.

11:09.620 --> 11:11.040
You invited me here.

11:13.460 --> 11:15.500
Whatever.
I'm being a downer.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.080
Let's not talk about it
anymore.

11:17.080 --> 11:19.210
Okay. So, what do you
want to do next?

11:19.210 --> 11:21.790
Uh, I think there's
a laser pointer in there

11:21.790 --> 11:23.670
that the Wadman's cat
seems to love.

11:23.670 --> 11:25.750

Duh! That's what makes it

for bringing me here.

12:58.880 --> 13:01.080
-No prob.
-(cell phone rings)

13:03.460 --> 13:05.120
(ringing continues)

13:05.120 --> 13:06.790
Is that my phone?

13:07.880 --> 13:09.210
Amber?

13:10.920 --> 13:12.710
Can I come down now?

13:14.120 --> 13:15.750
No.

13:15.750 --> 13:16.830
No?

13:16.830 --> 13:19.250
Not until you apologize
for stealing Jonah.

13:19.250 --> 13:22.120
What? I-I didn't steal Jonah.

13:22.120 --> 13:24.790
Yes, you did!
And I want to hear you say
"I'm sorry."

13:24.790 --> 13:26.620
(sirens wail in distance)

13:26.620 --> 13:28.210
Amber?

13:28.210 --> 13:29.880
It's the police.
Let me down!

13:31.670 --> 13:33.830
Amber, come back!

13:34.830 --> 13:36.540
Amber!

13:36.540 --> 13:38.710
You!

13:38.710 --> 13:41.290
You... snorpion!

13:41.290 --> 13:44.210
Amber, come back!

13:44.210 --> 13:45.790
Amber!

13:51.460 --> 13:54.500
Well, that was fun.
Just exactly where I wanted
to spend my Saturday night...

13:54.500 --> 13:56.330
at the police station.

13:57.460 --> 14:00.380
You always say you think
I'm too well-behaved.

14:00.380 --> 14:02.080
Well, there's a line,

14:02.080 --> 14:04.120
and it's right before
police station.

14:04.120 --> 14:07.120
-It wasn't even my idea.
-Even worse.

14:07.120 --> 14:08.710
If I ever have
to pick you up
from jail again,

14:08.710 --> 14:10.710
it better be because
you took some initiative.

14:10.710 --> 14:14.290
-It wasn't jail.
-The point is,
it wasn't your bed.

14:14.290 --> 14:16.290
You can't honestly be mad.

14:16.290 --> 14:19.250
You and Bowie
used to sneak out
all the time.

14:19.250 --> 14:21.040
You really wanna
make that argument?

14:23.210 --> 14:24.880
No.

14:24.880 --> 14:27.170
So, should I be deciding
my punishment?

14:27.170 --> 14:30.750
No! I'm the mother here.
I'll be deciding
your punishment.

14:33.830 --> 14:35.250
Any ideas?

14:35.250 --> 14:37.080
Of course I have ideas.
I'm the father.

14:43.580 --> 14:45.920
Should I go to my room
and think about what I've done?

14:45.920 --> 14:47.620
(sighs) Fine.

14:47.620 --> 14:49.170
It just seems
so unoriginal.

15:00.420 --> 15:01.670
(sighs)

15:01.670 --> 15:04.080
Her first time
sneaking out.

15:04.080 --> 15:06.620
I'm a swirl of terrified
and proud.

15:07.790 --> 15:10.080
She did manage
to get by you.

15:10.080 --> 15:12.750
The apprentice
has now become
the master.

15:12.750 --> 15:15.040
I don't know about master.

15:15.040 --> 15:17.120
I sleep like a log...
in a coma.

15:18.290 --> 15:20.540
Is it bad that the thing
I'm most upset about

15:20.540 --> 15:22.420
is that she didn't
invite me along?

15:22.420 --> 15:24.210
Not at all.

15:24.210 --> 15:26.210
Of course it is.

15:26.210 --> 15:28.710
That's not something
a good parents says.

15:28.710 --> 15:29.830
(sighs)

15:29.830 --> 15:31.380
I'm a terrible mom.

15:31.380 --> 15:34.670
Hey. You're a great mom.

15:34.670 --> 15:37.710
You're just not
a very typical one.

15:40.250 --> 15:42.000
Thank you for being here.

15:43.290 --> 15:45.420
I told you I would be.

15:45.420 --> 15:47.080
We're a team, remember?

15:47.080 --> 15:49.500
Right. Team Andi.

15:49.500 --> 15:50.830
Mm-hmm.

15:52.790 --> 15:54.420
Well...

15:54.420 --> 15:57.960
I definitely still owe you
for being my makeup model
the other day.

15:57.960 --> 16:00.000
-Yes you do.
-Are you hungry?

16:00.000 --> 16:01.420
Starving.

16:01.420 --> 16:03.330
How about chocolate chip
pancakes?

16:03.330 --> 16:05.210
Sounds great.

16:07.790 --> 16:09.290
You need me
to make them,
don't you?

16:09.290 --> 16:10.960
Only if you want them
to taste good.

16:10.960 --> 16:12.210
(laughs)

16:18.250 --> 16:19.500
(Cyrus and Buffy laughing)

16:19.500 --> 16:22.710
Told you.
The Ultimate field
always smells like f--

16:23.710 --> 16:25.290
Cyrus:
It's T.J.

16:25.290 --> 16:27.750
I see him.

16:27.750 --> 16:30.290
Wow. He looks a lot
meaner outside.

16:31.290 --> 16:33.960
I'm gonna go over there
and talk to him.

16:33.960 --> 16:35.750
You mean, yell at him?

16:35.750 --> 16:38.170
You can't just
go over there
and yell at him.

16:38.170 --> 16:40.540
Well, I can't yell at him
from here.

16:40.540 --> 16:42.500
Is there a plan
that doesn't
involve yelling?

16:45.920 --> 16:48.290
-Nope.
-I have one. I have one.

16:48.290 --> 16:50.960
Delicately open
a friendly dialogue.

16:50.960 --> 16:52.960
Or something in between.
You do you.

16:52.960 --> 16:56.080
Just don't do the you
that you usually do.

16:57.170 --> 16:59.290
Are you saying
I should be nice?

16:59.290 --> 17:01.710
Yes! At least...
open with it.

17:03.790 --> 17:06.580
Okay. But if that
doesn't work,

17:06.580 --> 17:08.170
there will be yelling.

17:15.420 --> 17:16.380

I would bite your head off,

17:20.540 --> 17:22.460
but I'm trying
this new thing today
where I don't.

17:22.460 --> 17:24.710
Okay...

17:24.710 --> 17:26.670
I know it can be tough
to be a leader.

17:26.670 --> 17:30.330
You want what's best
for the team, and I do, too.

17:30.330 --> 17:33.330
So, I can help,
if you let me.

17:33.330 --> 17:35.460
What can I do to make things
better between us?

17:36.620 --> 17:38.500
-Quit.
-Quit?

17:38.500 --> 17:41.420
-Go play on a girls' team.
-There is no girls' team.

17:41.420 --> 17:44.170
-That's not my problem.
-Listen!

17:45.750 --> 17:48.460
(inaudible)

17:52.960 --> 17:55.580
So, that went well.

17:55.580 --> 17:58.460
Cyrus, read my lips.

17:58.460 --> 18:01.000
Stop lip-reading!

18:08.710 --> 18:10.500
What can I get y--

18:10.500 --> 18:12.620
Oh, my gosh!
What happened?

18:12.620 --> 18:15.920
What happened?
You happened.

18:15.920 --> 18:17.500
After you ran off,

18:17.500 --> 18:19.790
I tried to climb down
the ferris wheel.

18:19.790 --> 18:22.580
-And...
-It didn't go well.

18:22.580 --> 18:26.420
Andi, I am so sorry!

18:26.420 --> 18:28.500
I really was having
a good time with you.

18:28.500 --> 18:31.250
And then Jonah called.

18:31.250 --> 18:33.120
I don't know
what I was thinking.

18:33.120 --> 18:35.290
And then the police came
and I panicked.

18:35.290 --> 18:37.380
I almost came back
and got you, I swear.

18:37.380 --> 18:40.500
Listen to that.
She almost had a conscience.

18:41.620 --> 18:44.500
What can I do?
Anything. Name it.

18:44.500 --> 18:46.580
Anything?

18:46.580 --> 18:49.420
A free milkshake?
A free lunch?

18:49.420 --> 18:51.580
Free baby taters
for life.

18:51.580 --> 18:52.790
Actually,

18:52.790 --> 18:54.750
I think all I need
are a few more napkins

18:54.750 --> 18:57.540
to clean off
all of this makeup.

18:57.540 --> 18:59.880
It's not real?

18:59.880 --> 19:02.620
Her mom's gonna be
a professional
makeup artist.

19:02.620 --> 19:04.380

to help us fool

19:04.380 --> 19:06.290

Andi! What happened?

19:11.250 --> 19:12.620

Yup. I'm fine.

19:21.290 --> 19:23.830
-This is good ice cream.
-Really good. Yeah.

19:23.830 --> 19:26.460
-So, she bought it?
-She totally bought it.

19:26.460 --> 19:29.000
I am so proud of myself.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.540
Revenge is a dish
best served cold.

19:31.540 --> 19:33.620
-(Andi laughs)
-Does yours taste okay?

19:33.620 --> 19:36.880
-Yeah. Yours doesn't?
-It just smells...

19:36.880 --> 19:38.380
-weird.
-What?

19:39.710 --> 19:42.250
Oh! I fell for it again.

19:42.250 --> 19:44.500
Fifteen years of this.

19:44.500 --> 19:46.250
Oh, wait.

19:46.250 --> 19:48.250
Uh, mine
smells funny, too.

19:48.250 --> 19:49.790
Oh, great.
How stupid do you
think I am?

19:49.790 --> 19:51.500

to fall for the decoy!

19:51.500 --> 19:53.290
Oh!

19:53.290 --> 19:55.880

20:21.120 --> 20:23.250
Should Jonah and I
be holding hands by now?

20:23.250 --> 20:25.880
Perhaps you suffer
from hyperhidrosis.

20:25.880 --> 20:27.120
Sweaty palms?

20:27.120 --> 20:29.710
So, if I'm holding
Jonah's hand...

20:29.710 --> 20:31.670
it can just happen?

Andi, please step over
to the table marked "A."

Jonah, the "B" table.
Stay with your group.

20:37.250 --> 20:38.420
Jonah: This is wrong.

20:38.420 --> 20:40.120
Why is their group
getting special treatment?

20:40.120 --> 20:42.420
-Cookies!
-You won't be able
to get any.

20:42.420 --> 20:43.710
They're going straight
to Group A.

20:43.710 --> 20:45.080
Hi, we're from Group A.
