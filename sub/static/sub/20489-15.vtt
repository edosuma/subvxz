00:47.647 --> 00:50.050
Don't waste your time.
She's not interested.

00:50.085 --> 00:51.216
Uh huh.

00:51.251 --> 00:53.653
Maybe she's interested, she
just doesn't know it yet.

01:07.267 --> 01:08.468
Damn.

01:11.271 --> 01:12.672
I told you.

01:12.707 --> 01:14.039
Blah blah blah.

01:14.074 --> 01:16.076
Hey, can i get
a virgin daiquiri?

01:16.111 --> 01:17.677
You got it.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.279
Wooh. Aren't you the
wild and crazy woman tonight.

01:19.314 --> 01:20.880
Hey, i'm taking
it easy tonight.

01:20.915 --> 01:22.082
That's a big surprise.

01:22.482 --> 01:24.083
You take it easy every night.

01:24.118 --> 01:25.650
C'mon let's get funky, girl.

01:25.685 --> 01:28.488
You know,
just because you think
i'm a little conservative

01:28.523 --> 01:30.490
doesn't mean that i...

01:30.890 --> 01:33.293
doesn't mean that,
what, you're uptight?

01:33.693 --> 01:35.695
You think i'm uptight?

01:35.730 --> 01:38.063
Maybe a little.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.664
You could loosen up some.

01:39.699 --> 01:42.902
I am the most easy-going
person i know.

01:42.937 --> 01:44.121
Uh huh?

01:44.156 --> 01:45.305
Uh huh.

01:47.707 --> 01:49.709
Thanks.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.676
It's taken care of.

01:51.711 --> 01:53.713
The gentleman behind you?

01:59.719 --> 02:01.721
Thank you.

02:01.756 --> 02:03.688
Caleb.

02:03.723 --> 02:05.725
Dance with me.

02:41.361 --> 02:42.562
Excuse me.

02:42.962 --> 02:44.164
Can i get one more, please?

02:44.564 --> 02:45.765
Thanks.

03:19.399 --> 03:22.602
Never thought i'd meet someone
like you in a place like this.

03:23.002 --> 03:25.004
You know, i don't even
know your last name.

03:25.039 --> 03:28.173
Mathius.
Caleb mathius.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.575
Feels like i've
known you my whole life.

03:30.610 --> 03:32.612
God,
that sounds like the
biggest come on-line.

03:32.647 --> 03:34.979
No it doesn't.

03:35.014 --> 03:37.817
Not coming from you.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.636
Maybe we
should slow down.

03:57.036 --> 03:59.804
Come on, emma.

03:59.839 --> 04:01.841
Just one more kiss?

05:10.710 --> 05:12.111
You okay?

05:12.146 --> 05:13.513
I think so.

05:13.913 --> 05:15.715
What the hell
happened right there?

05:15.750 --> 05:17.517
I think he was
trying to kill me.

06:27.653 --> 06:28.855
I don't
understand it.

06:29.255 --> 06:30.456
Where were you when
this was going on?

06:30.491 --> 06:31.875
I was sitting
at the bar.

06:31.910 --> 06:33.224
It all seemed harmless enough.

06:33.259 --> 06:34.460
I mean, the guy
looked completely normal.

06:34.495 --> 06:35.661
He was.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.865
At first, it was
just an innocent kiss,

06:39.265 --> 06:42.433
but, then something
started to happen.

06:42.468 --> 06:45.271
I couldn't breath and i
felt like i was suffocating.

06:45.671 --> 06:47.238
And that's when
i came around the corner.

06:47.273 --> 06:50.076
It just looked
like the guy was sucking
the life right out of her.

06:52.478 --> 06:54.045
All right.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.883
Let me see
what i can find out about
this guy from the database.

06:57.283 --> 06:58.484
What's his name again?

06:58.519 --> 07:00.303
Caleb mathius.

07:00.338 --> 07:02.088
Caleb mathius.

07:02.488 --> 07:04.090
Meanwhile, why
don't you and jesse go
back to the nightclub.

07:04.490 --> 07:05.691
See what you can dig up.

07:05.726 --> 07:06.492
I'm going, too.

07:06.527 --> 07:07.658
No, no.

07:07.693 --> 07:09.295
Wait. Until we
know more about this guy,

07:09.330 --> 07:11.114
i'd feel better
if you just stayed here.

07:11.149 --> 07:12.899
And i'd feel a lot
better going with them.

07:14.901 --> 07:16.502
The last thing
i want to do is hang
around here playing

07:16.903 --> 07:19.105
the poor victim.

07:19.140 --> 07:21.307
Yeah, all right.

07:21.342 --> 07:23.309
Watch her.

07:26.913 --> 07:29.315
We're in the middle of
a crisis that desperately
needs to be stopped.

07:29.350 --> 07:32.919
Six promising new mutant
recruits have been found dead

07:32.954 --> 07:35.939
within the past five months.

07:35.974 --> 07:38.890
Any theories, miss fries.

07:38.925 --> 07:40.927
Have you ruled
out the possibility
these recruits defected

07:41.327 --> 07:42.894
to mutant x?

07:42.929 --> 07:44.931
Do you mean to tell me,
in your expert opinion,

07:45.331 --> 07:48.534
that adam is trying to form some
kind of new mutant sorority?

07:48.569 --> 07:50.501
Course not, mr eckhart.

07:50.536 --> 07:52.538
I'm merely trying
to rule out the obvious.

07:52.939 --> 07:56.142
Yes, well, you'll excuse me if
i find your investigation...

07:56.177 --> 07:58.945
god, about as
cold as this coffee.

07:58.980 --> 08:01.747
Allow me.

08:15.761 --> 08:18.564
Given the grave circumstances,
i do hope your new mutant

08:18.965 --> 08:22.568
abilities prove more useful to
me than as a human hotplate.

08:22.603 --> 08:25.371
I believe we're dealing
with a mutant serial killer.

08:25.406 --> 08:28.174
His victims have been
preyed upon, if you will.

08:28.209 --> 08:30.141
He knows what he wants.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.777
So he takes them by surprise.

08:32.178 --> 08:35.346
Alured is a
more apt description.

08:35.381 --> 08:38.583
This monster we're looking
for isn't wearing a hockey mask

08:38.619 --> 08:41.352
or wielding an axe.

08:41.386 --> 08:44.956
He's handsome,
charismatic, charming,

08:44.991 --> 08:47.793
with the ability to disarm
his victim with a gesture.

08:47.828 --> 08:50.561
Your hypotheses
are intriguing.

08:50.596 --> 08:52.999
But at this
point, i'm much more
interested in a result.

08:53.399 --> 08:55.001
I understand.

08:55.401 --> 08:57.003
My investigation has
pin-pointed a possible suspect.

08:57.403 --> 08:59.405
I'm confident
that the killer is...

08:59.440 --> 09:00.571
good.

09:00.606 --> 09:03.009
I want an
end to this murder
spree immediately.

09:23.829 --> 09:25.230
Club's not open.

09:25.265 --> 09:26.597
Yeah, we know.

09:26.632 --> 09:28.234
Just wanted to ask you
a few questions, though.

09:28.269 --> 09:29.435
You probably remembers
from last night.

09:29.835 --> 09:31.837
We were both here.

09:31.872 --> 09:33.804
You served us.

09:33.839 --> 09:35.806
Hey, we get
a lot of traffic.

09:35.841 --> 09:39.445
One of your party boys
attacked our friend last night.

09:39.480 --> 09:41.412
He bought me drink?

09:41.447 --> 09:43.014
His name
is caleb mathius.

09:43.049 --> 09:45.051
Six foot, dark
hair, medium build.

09:45.086 --> 09:46.617
Haunting eyes.

09:46.652 --> 09:48.254
Anybody who fits
that description?

09:48.654 --> 09:50.221
Sorry.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.258
But when you pour drinks
for eight hours and get hit on

09:52.293 --> 09:55.461
by anything wearing pants,
faces start to blur.

10:05.871 --> 10:09.875
I wish i could be more help.

10:09.910 --> 10:12.678
Did you sense anything?

10:13.079 --> 10:15.046
She's scared.

10:15.081 --> 10:17.483
Let's take a
look around, huh.

10:37.103 --> 10:38.304
Any luck?

10:38.339 --> 10:39.470
No.

10:39.505 --> 10:41.507
I just searched the
database up and down,

10:41.542 --> 10:43.509
and i can't find a
caleb mathius anywhere.

10:43.544 --> 10:45.076
It's like
he doesn't exist.

10:45.111 --> 10:46.712
Yeah. Maybe he
gave her an alias.

10:46.747 --> 10:48.279
I mean, he clearly
exists, right?

10:48.314 --> 10:50.316
The question is, what
does he want with emma?

10:50.351 --> 10:52.318
Wait a minute.

10:52.718 --> 10:54.320
Take a look at this.

10:54.720 --> 10:57.523
I just pulled up
a missing persons file.

10:57.558 --> 10:58.689
Yeah.

10:58.724 --> 11:00.726
Six women over the last
five months have disappeared

11:00.761 --> 11:02.545
in the vicinity
of that nightclub.

11:02.580 --> 11:04.330
So it's not
an isolated incident.

11:04.365 --> 11:05.896
I don't think so.

11:05.931 --> 11:07.933
They all have
the same profile.

11:07.968 --> 11:09.935
All young,
attractive women.

11:09.970 --> 11:11.102
Yeah.

11:11.137 --> 11:12.338
We need to get
her off the street.

11:12.738 --> 11:13.539
Brennan?

11:15.141 --> 11:17.143
I want you and
jesse to bring emma back
to sanctuary immediately.

11:17.178 --> 11:19.110
Why? What's the rush?

11:19.145 --> 11:21.147
It's just not safe for
her out there right now.

11:21.547 --> 11:23.149
I don't want
to take any chances.

11:23.184 --> 11:24.750
All right.
We're on our way.

11:51.577 --> 11:53.579
What? No re-match?

12:24.009 --> 12:25.211
That's him.

13:00.045 --> 13:01.247
Nothing more we can do.

13:01.647 --> 13:02.848
Let's get out
of here. Come on.

13:11.257 --> 13:13.259
Emma.
Let's go.

13:23.536 --> 13:25.538
Mr eckhart, the killer
you sought is dead.

13:25.573 --> 13:27.540
Finally putting
an end to his rampage.

13:27.575 --> 13:28.741
Yes.

13:29.141 --> 13:31.543
I understand your weapon
of choice was a gsa vehicle.

13:31.578 --> 13:33.946
I must admit my methods
were a little unorthodox.

13:33.981 --> 13:37.114
But i didn't want
to risk losing him.

13:37.149 --> 13:40.352
Were you at least
able to retrieve the
remains of mr mathius,

13:40.387 --> 13:43.155
so we can
perform an autopsy?

13:43.190 --> 13:45.122
There was a commotion.

13:45.157 --> 13:48.360
Miss fries,
in order to truly understand
the criminal mind,

13:48.395 --> 13:51.964
and to prevent
this catastrophe
from happening again,

13:51.999 --> 13:55.132
it is imperative we have
a subject to examine.

13:55.167 --> 13:57.935
Perhaps the
next time you decide
to do a hit and run,

13:57.970 --> 14:00.773
you'll be prudent enough to
pick up the body before you run.

14:54.426 --> 14:56.028
Brennan?

15:01.233 --> 15:03.235
Jesse?

15:04.436 --> 15:06.038
Who's there?

15:19.251 --> 15:22.019
Hello, emma.

15:22.054 --> 15:24.056
Aren't you glad to see me?

15:26.859 --> 15:29.261
How about one more kiss?

15:35.668 --> 15:37.269
Adam!

15:37.304 --> 15:38.836
Adam!

15:38.871 --> 15:40.072
You've got to do something.

15:40.472 --> 15:41.238
What?

15:41.273 --> 15:42.274
He's here.

15:42.309 --> 15:43.275
Who's here?

15:43.310 --> 15:44.476
Caleb.

15:44.877 --> 15:47.679
He was standing right here.

15:47.714 --> 15:50.482
It must
have been a vision.

15:50.883 --> 15:54.852
But it was so real.

15:54.887 --> 15:57.289
Something happened
when he kissed me.

15:57.324 --> 16:00.057
I can't explain it, but it...

16:00.092 --> 16:02.895
it's like we're
connected some how.

16:03.295 --> 16:04.461
Hey, emma.

16:04.496 --> 16:06.698
It's okay. You're okay now.

16:06.733 --> 16:08.866
No. I think he's alive.

16:08.901 --> 16:10.868
I think caleb
is still out there.

16:10.903 --> 16:13.706
Emma, you saw him
die with your own eyes.

16:13.741 --> 16:15.307
So did brennan
and jesse.

16:15.342 --> 16:16.926
Look, i don't care.

16:16.961 --> 16:18.475
He's alive. I feel it.

16:18.510 --> 16:21.313
And if we don't do something,
he's going to kill again.

16:21.348 --> 16:22.732
Emma.

16:22.767 --> 16:24.081
What?

16:24.116 --> 16:26.884
You think i'm crazy.

16:26.919 --> 16:28.520
No, no one's
saying you're crazy...

16:28.555 --> 16:29.722
you don't have to.

16:29.757 --> 16:30.522
Emma.

16:30.923 --> 16:32.489
Emma, wait.

16:32.524 --> 16:34.526
Keep your eye on her.

16:36.528 --> 16:38.530
Guys, i want you to hack
into the county morgue

16:38.565 --> 16:40.132
and check out their
surveillance records.

16:40.532 --> 16:41.699
The morgue?
What for?

16:41.734 --> 16:44.136
Emma thinks
caleb's still alive.

16:44.171 --> 16:45.337
Are you kidding?

16:45.738 --> 16:46.904
The guy's toast.

16:46.939 --> 16:48.505
Adam, she's just a little
freaked out, that's all.

16:48.540 --> 16:50.142
I hope you both are right,
but we know enough about her

16:50.177 --> 16:51.744
psionic powers that
we gotta check this out.

16:52.144 --> 16:53.946
Agreed?

16:53.981 --> 16:55.748
Yeah.

17:55.407 --> 17:57.775
Why are you following me?

17:57.810 --> 18:00.577
Because i'm
worried about you.

18:00.612 --> 18:03.015
You're worried
that i'm losing my mind
and that i'm seeing things.

18:03.050 --> 18:05.017
You know that's
not true, emma.

18:05.417 --> 18:09.421
I don't know what's
happening to me.

18:09.456 --> 18:12.624
Want to talk about it?

18:12.659 --> 18:14.591
Might help.

18:14.626 --> 18:18.230
It's like he's still got
some kind of hold on me.

18:18.265 --> 18:20.249
Caleb?

18:20.284 --> 18:22.199
Yeah.

18:22.234 --> 18:24.236
I was drawn
here for some reason.

18:30.642 --> 18:33.045
Brennan,
check this out.

18:37.850 --> 18:44.256
1:47pm two paramedics show up
with the body of caleb mathius.

18:44.291 --> 18:47.459
Yeah, so what,
he looks pretty dead to me.

18:47.860 --> 18:49.026
Yeah, me too.

18:49.061 --> 18:50.662
But wait'll you see this.

18:53.465 --> 18:54.631
Hey, wait a minute.

18:54.666 --> 18:55.868
That's the
chick from the gsa that
tried to run me down.

18:56.268 --> 18:57.034
Yeah, it gets worse.

18:57.069 --> 18:59.471
Look who she leaves with.

18:59.506 --> 19:01.073
Oh my god.

19:01.473 --> 19:02.674
Yeah.

19:03.075 --> 19:05.477
This jerk just doesn't
want to stay dead.

19:18.290 --> 19:20.692
Sorry.
This was a waste of time.

19:20.727 --> 19:23.095
Not if it puts
your mind at ease.

19:23.130 --> 19:25.114
I don't mind looking.

19:25.149 --> 19:27.064
So what about you?

19:27.099 --> 19:28.300
You picking up anything?

19:28.700 --> 19:29.501
No, i tried.

19:29.902 --> 19:31.103
I'm not getting anything.

19:31.138 --> 19:32.304
Why don't we just head back.

19:32.339 --> 19:33.470
Okay.

19:33.505 --> 19:35.107
I'm going to run
to the ladies' first.

19:39.511 --> 19:40.712
Hey, adam, it's emma.

19:40.747 --> 19:42.331
We're on our way back.

19:42.366 --> 19:43.916
Good. See you here.

20:08.740 --> 20:09.506
Hey, adam.

20:09.541 --> 20:11.108
Emma was right.

20:11.143 --> 20:12.344
Caleb is among
the walking dead.

20:12.744 --> 20:13.911
Great.

20:13.946 --> 20:17.149
And now i know
why we couldn't locate
him in the database.

20:17.184 --> 20:19.952
It's because he's
listed as deceased.

20:19.987 --> 20:21.518
So, what?

20:21.553 --> 20:23.555
He can revive
himself after death?

20:23.956 --> 20:25.557
It looks that way.

20:25.958 --> 20:28.360
You mean like
a modern day vampire?

20:28.395 --> 20:29.526
Yeah.

20:29.561 --> 20:31.528
How's that possible?

20:31.563 --> 20:35.167
Well, we know that there are
new mutants who can subsist off

20:35.202 --> 20:39.136
the absorbed energy
of plant life, right?

20:39.171 --> 20:42.374
So maybe what we're dealing
with is an evolving mutation

20:42.409 --> 20:44.741
with a similar ability.

20:44.776 --> 20:49.181
So you mean
this guy is feeding on the
life force of new mutants?

20:49.216 --> 20:51.583
Yeah, like giving
them the kiss of death.

20:51.618 --> 20:53.585
Or something like that.

20:55.187 --> 20:56.788
Emma, you ready to go?

21:01.193 --> 21:03.195
Emma?

21:19.444 --> 21:21.046
Adam. Something's wrong.

21:21.446 --> 21:22.648
I can't find emma anywhere.

21:22.683 --> 21:23.849
Where are you?

21:24.249 --> 21:25.050
The red club.

21:25.450 --> 21:26.851
Emma wanted
to come one last time,

21:26.886 --> 21:28.370
just to make
sure she wasn't crazy.

21:28.405 --> 21:29.820
I left her alone
for two minutes.

21:29.855 --> 21:32.658
When i got back all
i found was her com-link.

21:32.693 --> 21:34.224
All right, shalimar,

21:34.259 --> 21:35.861
i want you to come back
to sanctuary immediately.

21:35.896 --> 21:37.427
What about emma?

21:37.462 --> 21:38.664
I'm going to
send brennan and jesse.

21:39.064 --> 21:39.830
Now don't worry.

21:39.865 --> 21:41.031
They're going to find her.

21:41.066 --> 21:42.267
I want you to
come back here asap.

21:42.668 --> 21:43.468
You understand?

21:43.869 --> 21:46.672
Yeah. I'm on my way.

21:57.883 --> 22:00.285
Welcome to my world.

22:00.686 --> 22:02.287
My home.

22:04.690 --> 22:06.692
Morning.

22:08.694 --> 22:10.696
Why are
doing this, caleb?

22:11.096 --> 22:14.299
I don't have a choice.

22:14.334 --> 22:17.502
I have to, to survive.

22:17.903 --> 22:19.104
What do you want?

22:19.139 --> 22:20.305
Sympathy?

22:20.706 --> 22:23.909
You filthy parasitic freak.

22:30.716 --> 22:33.518
Well,
aren't you the bold one.

22:42.327 --> 22:44.695
Nice try, emma.

22:44.730 --> 22:47.532
But your little mind
games won't work on me.

22:51.937 --> 22:54.339
What are you
going to do to us?

22:54.740 --> 22:58.744
Never ask a question which
you don't want answered.

23:15.560 --> 23:17.527
No, don't waste your energy.

23:17.562 --> 23:19.164
The cuffs are
titanium reinforced.

23:19.199 --> 23:21.566
Looks like you're screwed.

23:21.601 --> 23:23.568
What about you?

23:23.969 --> 23:26.772
As a precautionary measure,
eckhart implanted me with

23:26.807 --> 23:28.338
a gsa tracking device.

23:28.373 --> 23:31.176
My people
should be on their way.

23:31.576 --> 23:34.745
I hope for your sake
they show up in time.

23:34.780 --> 23:39.584
Unless we want to put our heads
together and work as a team.

23:39.619 --> 23:44.389
We are chained
in a cellar in the middle
of god knows where.

23:44.424 --> 23:46.391
What'd you have in mind?

23:46.792 --> 23:47.993
I'm a psionic.

23:48.393 --> 23:49.594
What about you?

23:49.995 --> 23:51.161
Elemental.

23:51.196 --> 23:53.198
I can raise and
lower my body temperature.

23:53.233 --> 23:54.765
Really?

23:54.800 --> 23:56.802
How low can you go?

24:07.212 --> 24:10.015
I'm afraid we lost contact
with miss fries at the morgue.

24:10.415 --> 24:14.820
More alarmingly,
the body of caleb mathius
has mysteriously disappeared.

24:15.220 --> 24:16.787
But where is it?

24:16.822 --> 24:19.224
It couldn't have just
gotten up and walked out?

24:19.259 --> 24:21.626
I'm afraid, sir, that is
exactly what has happened.

24:22.027 --> 24:24.029
I had one of our techs
retrieve a blood sample from

24:24.064 --> 24:25.595
the scene of the accident.

24:25.630 --> 24:30.035
These cells not only
appear to be alive,

24:30.070 --> 24:34.039
they're actually regenerating.

24:34.439 --> 24:37.242
How is that possible?

24:37.642 --> 24:41.045
It's my theory we're dealing
with a new mutant who's serial

24:41.080 --> 24:44.449
killing rampage is driven not
by deviant criminal behaviour

24:44.484 --> 24:46.852
but practical necessity.

24:46.887 --> 24:49.219
It's fascinating.

24:49.254 --> 24:53.223
So he actually has
the power to survive death.

24:53.258 --> 24:56.862
I want this new mutant
captured immediately so we can

24:57.262 --> 24:59.229
examine this precious dna.

24:59.264 --> 25:01.231
But, sir,
he could be anywhere.

25:01.266 --> 25:02.833
That's where
you're wrong, dr. Harrison.

25:02.868 --> 25:05.235
Call security, get
miss fries' tracking codes.

25:05.270 --> 25:07.672
Our global satellite system
will be able to pinpoint

25:08.073 --> 25:10.040
her exact location.

25:10.075 --> 25:14.079
Let's just pray he has her.

25:20.485 --> 25:21.251
It's useless.

25:21.286 --> 25:22.452
You can do it, pamela.

25:22.487 --> 25:24.089
You just need
to lower your body
a few more degrees.

25:24.489 --> 25:25.690
I can't.
I'm not strong enough.

25:25.725 --> 25:26.857
I told you.

25:26.892 --> 25:28.093
I'm going
to help you.

25:28.128 --> 25:29.294
But i can't
do it alone.

25:29.694 --> 25:31.296
I need you
to concentrate.

25:33.698 --> 25:36.101
Now close your eyes and
focus all your energy
on the hand cuffs.

25:40.105 --> 25:42.908
Good. That's it.

25:42.943 --> 25:44.509
Keep going.

25:56.521 --> 25:58.889
Now.

25:58.924 --> 26:00.926
It worked.

26:00.961 --> 26:02.928
Now try me.

26:03.328 --> 26:04.930
Pamela.

26:05.330 --> 26:08.133
I don't think so.

26:08.533 --> 26:11.736
Eckhart's got this thing
about us helping the other side.

26:12.137 --> 26:13.738
Sorry.

26:16.541 --> 26:18.108
You can't just leave me here.

26:18.143 --> 26:20.145
You know what
he's going to do to me.

26:25.350 --> 26:26.516
Caleb's alive.

26:26.551 --> 26:27.752
Yeah, i'm afraid so.

26:28.153 --> 26:29.354
He's got her,
doesn't he?

26:29.389 --> 26:31.756
I want to go get her.

26:32.157 --> 26:33.723
No, no, no.

26:33.758 --> 26:35.325
I don't want to lose you.

26:35.360 --> 26:36.962
It's too dangerous for
you out there right now.

26:36.997 --> 26:38.563
You just let jesse
and brennan find her.

26:38.964 --> 26:40.530
Yeah,
and what if they can't?

26:40.565 --> 26:43.368
Look,
there's the possibility that
he's got her locked away

26:43.768 --> 26:44.935
somewhere just as insurance.

26:44.970 --> 26:47.337
What happens
if he needs to feed?

26:47.372 --> 26:50.175
Well, hopefully, we'll
find her before that happens.

27:06.992 --> 27:08.994
Here.

27:09.394 --> 27:11.361
Thank you.

27:11.396 --> 27:13.398
Don't spread it around.

27:17.002 --> 27:19.004
Oh.

27:52.637 --> 27:54.239
Oh!

28:14.659 --> 28:17.462
Now that was cool.

28:27.072 --> 28:29.074
Pamela, look out!

28:38.683 --> 28:40.285
Pamela!

28:45.090 --> 28:46.691
Caleb, no!

29:09.414 --> 29:11.416
Pamela's been implanted
with a tracking chip.

29:11.451 --> 29:12.982
Her people
are looking for her.

29:13.017 --> 29:14.619
If you don't get
her out of here now,

29:14.654 --> 29:16.586
they're going to find you.

29:16.621 --> 29:19.424
I'm telling
you the truth, caleb.

29:19.459 --> 29:20.990
You've got to trust me.

29:21.025 --> 29:22.992
Why are you
trying to help me?

29:23.027 --> 29:25.029
Because i don't believe
that you want to hurt me.

29:25.064 --> 29:27.832
I think you
do it to stay alive.

29:28.233 --> 29:30.200
It's your mutation.

29:30.235 --> 29:33.438
But if you don't
get her out of here now,

29:33.473 --> 29:35.039
they're going to find us.

30:11.876 --> 30:13.077
I already told you.

30:13.112 --> 30:14.244
I don't know anything.

30:14.279 --> 30:15.480
Well that's not going to
work for you this time.

30:15.880 --> 30:17.046
Where's caleb?

30:17.081 --> 30:19.884
Look, i don't have to answer
any of your questions.

30:20.285 --> 30:21.851
Yeah, you do.

30:21.886 --> 30:23.488
You see, he's got someone
who means a lot to us.

30:23.523 --> 30:25.089
And we're not just
going to walk away.

30:25.124 --> 30:26.256
Look, we know
you're scared.

30:26.291 --> 30:29.093
We just want to
get our friend back.

30:29.128 --> 30:31.713
What, are
you hiding him?

30:31.748 --> 30:34.299
I don't
know anything.

30:34.699 --> 30:36.266
I'm not responsible.

30:36.301 --> 30:38.303
But you're
involved - somehow.

30:38.338 --> 30:40.305
You're a new
mutant, aren't you?

30:47.512 --> 30:50.315
I have the ability to
detect other new mutants.

30:50.350 --> 30:55.137
You've been helping
him, haven't you?

30:55.172 --> 30:59.924
And feeding him his
victims one by one.

30:59.959 --> 31:01.090
Hm.

31:01.125 --> 31:02.727
It's not that simple.

31:02.762 --> 31:04.329
He was going to kill me.

31:04.729 --> 31:05.530
Then tells us where he is.

31:05.930 --> 31:06.731
We can protect you.

31:07.131 --> 31:08.333
You can't.

31:08.733 --> 31:09.934
No one can.

31:10.335 --> 31:12.737
You don't
get it, do you?

31:13.137 --> 31:15.740
Caleb can't be killed.

31:15.775 --> 31:18.343
He just keeps coming back.

31:23.948 --> 31:25.550
We have a problem.

31:25.950 --> 31:27.952
If caleb can regenerate
every time he's killed
then we can't stop him.

31:27.987 --> 31:30.355
Not necessarily.

31:30.755 --> 31:34.359
As soon as he
regenerates he needs
to feed on new mutant

31:34.394 --> 31:37.527
life force to recharge
his metabolism, right?

31:37.562 --> 31:40.365
But what if he's killed
again before he has
a chance to recharge?

31:40.400 --> 31:43.132
Think that can
kill him for good?

31:43.167 --> 31:45.570
Well, it might be the window
we need to shut him down.

31:45.605 --> 31:46.736
Adam.

31:46.771 --> 31:47.937
Yeah, brennan, go ahead.

31:47.972 --> 31:49.574
So it turns out the waitress
has been feeding caleb

31:49.609 --> 31:50.775
his new mutant victims.

31:51.175 --> 31:52.742
But she won't
tell us where he is.

31:52.777 --> 31:54.379
What, she won't tell you because
she doesn't know or because

31:54.414 --> 31:55.945
she's afraid to?

31:55.980 --> 31:57.982
Because she doesn't
want to be his next meal.

31:58.017 --> 31:59.984
We're going to head
over to her apartment now.

32:00.019 --> 32:01.403
Take a look around.

32:01.438 --> 32:02.752
All right. Good.

32:02.787 --> 32:04.389
You guys let me know
what you come up with.

32:07.191 --> 32:09.193
Shalimar?

32:35.219 --> 32:36.620
Okay, emma, i did it.

32:36.655 --> 32:37.987
I got rid of her.

32:38.022 --> 32:39.223
So they're not going to find us.

32:39.624 --> 32:41.225
Good, caleb.
That's great.

32:41.260 --> 32:42.844
Oh, what's the matter?

32:42.879 --> 32:44.394
Nothing. I'm fine.

32:44.429 --> 32:46.030
Your handcuffs.
They're uncomfortable.

32:46.065 --> 32:47.632
No, no. That's fine.

32:50.435 --> 32:52.637
So you were
trying to get away?

32:52.672 --> 32:54.839
No, that's...
that's not it.

32:54.874 --> 32:56.406
Liar!

32:56.441 --> 33:00.445
Don't insult me, emma.

33:00.845 --> 33:04.048
I was hoping that
you were different.

33:04.449 --> 33:07.652
I thought
you understood me.

33:07.687 --> 33:09.218
I do, caleb.

33:09.253 --> 33:10.455
I was just scared.

33:10.855 --> 33:12.657
I didn't know what to do.

33:12.692 --> 33:14.459
How can
i trust you, emma?

33:14.859 --> 33:16.461
What do
you want from me?

33:29.674 --> 33:32.477
A kiss.

33:40.084 --> 33:41.886
I'm going to make
this real easy for you.

33:41.921 --> 33:43.688
I know you know where
caleb has my friend.

33:43.723 --> 33:44.854
Look...

33:44.889 --> 33:46.456
no, you look.

33:46.491 --> 33:48.092
All i'm asking you to
do is what you've done for

33:48.127 --> 33:50.712
this creep time and time again.

33:50.747 --> 33:53.297
Tell him you
found another one.

34:00.905 --> 34:02.907
Take me to him.

34:02.942 --> 34:04.509
Now.

34:28.132 --> 34:30.134
Emma?

34:58.563 --> 35:00.565
Emma.

35:01.365 --> 35:02.932
Emma?

35:02.967 --> 35:04.969
Emma. Emma.

35:05.004 --> 35:07.389
Emma.

35:07.424 --> 35:09.774
Oh god.

35:39.003 --> 35:41.405
I'm so sorry, emma.

35:47.411 --> 35:49.413
It's over.

35:49.448 --> 35:51.415
She's gone.

36:16.240 --> 36:18.242
I won't let you do this
to anyone ever again.

36:18.277 --> 36:20.645
You can't stop me.

36:20.680 --> 36:23.047
No one can.

37:32.316 --> 37:34.719
Adam.

37:35.119 --> 37:37.521
Emma's dead.

37:45.129 --> 37:47.932
I didn't make it in time.

37:47.967 --> 37:49.551
She's gone.

37:49.586 --> 37:51.135
Well, wait.

37:51.535 --> 37:53.937
Where's caleb?

37:53.972 --> 37:56.305
I killed him.

37:56.340 --> 37:59.143
Shalimar, that's when he
regenerates and needs to feed.

38:03.948 --> 38:05.950
So, i want you to
listen to me very carefully.

38:05.985 --> 38:08.352
I need you to
get out of there now.

38:10.755 --> 38:11.956
Shalimar.

38:16.360 --> 38:17.561
Shalimar?

38:20.765 --> 38:21.966
Shalimar!

38:28.372 --> 38:30.775
When are you going
to learn to stay down?

38:34.378 --> 38:35.544
You.

38:35.579 --> 38:37.581
Kiss yourself goodbye.

39:01.205 --> 39:02.406
Your nine lives are up.

39:28.032 --> 39:30.034
She's alive.

39:41.645 --> 39:43.647
Pity she couldn't
be more helpful.

39:44.048 --> 39:46.450
I'm afraid the only thing
left to tell us is the method

39:46.485 --> 39:48.052
by which she died

39:48.452 --> 39:50.419
- forensically
speaking, of course.

39:50.454 --> 39:54.058
Hopefully, we can discover
how the new mutant absorbs

39:54.093 --> 39:56.460
the life force of
the other new mutants.

39:59.663 --> 40:03.632
What's going on?

40:03.667 --> 40:06.871
Well,
so much for the autopsy.

40:22.486 --> 40:24.088
Are you sure you should
be out partying like this?

40:24.123 --> 40:25.289
I'm fine.

40:25.689 --> 40:28.092
Besides, this is
exactly what i needed.

40:29.293 --> 40:32.496
How are you two doing?

40:32.531 --> 40:35.699
Hey,
want to take a hike?

40:36.100 --> 40:39.103
You heard him.

40:39.138 --> 40:41.422
Next time.

40:41.457 --> 40:43.707
Yeah, right.

40:44.108 --> 40:45.309
Okay, this is
ridiculous, you guys.

40:45.344 --> 40:46.475
I'm fine.

40:46.510 --> 40:48.878
I can handle myself.

40:48.913 --> 40:50.514
Now go out there
and have some fun,

40:50.549 --> 40:52.516
or please,
at least let me.

40:52.551 --> 40:54.919
I mean it. Go.

40:58.122 --> 40:59.523
Be good.

40:59.558 --> 41:00.925
Yeah, right.

41:06.931 --> 41:08.532
Emma.

41:18.142 --> 41:20.544
So how about it?

41:20.945 --> 41:23.347
One more kiss?

41:25.749 --> 41:28.552
You can't hurt
me any more, caleb.

41:28.587 --> 41:31.355
You're dead.

41:40.164 --> 41:41.565
Hey.

41:41.600 --> 41:42.932
Hey.

41:42.967 --> 41:44.568
Can i buy you a drink?

41:44.969 --> 41:46.570
How about a dance?

41:46.605 --> 41:47.771
All right.

41:48.172 --> 41:49.338
All right.

41:49.373 --> 41:50.574
And then i'll
buy you a drink.

41:50.609 --> 41:52.176
Okay.

41:53.305 --> 41:59.945
