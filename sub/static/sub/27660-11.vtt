WEBVTT

00:05.005 --> 00:06.842
Previously on
"Future Man."

00:06.843 --> 00:08.344
Earth is dying.

00:08.345 --> 00:10.641
Luc--luc--luckky for us,
the Solar System gave us

00:10.642 --> 00:12.227
a spare planet right next door.

00:12.228 --> 00:14.566
And I'm gonna be
the first b-b-boy on MARS.

00:14.567 --> 00:15.776
Hey, Jimmy.

00:15.777 --> 00:16.987
You excited about
the MARS launch?

00:16.988 --> 00:18.239
You bet, Stu.

00:18.240 --> 00:19.701
Check out the new suit.

00:19.702 --> 00:20.995
First boy on MARS!

00:20.996 --> 00:22.707
MARS actually stands for

00:22.708 --> 00:25.003
Mankind's Automated
Reality System.

00:25.004 --> 00:26.046
That's where I took you today.

00:27.718 --> 00:30.179
- Will you come with me?
- Sure.

00:30.180 --> 00:31.725
Stu sees humanity
as a problem.

00:31.726 --> 00:33.436
This is his solution.

00:33.437 --> 00:36.985
The subject must always
enter the system willingly.

00:36.986 --> 00:38.614
Anyone who refuses
to go to MARS

00:38.615 --> 00:39.908
gets killed by this.

00:39.909 --> 00:41.703
He has 12 million of these.

00:41.704 --> 00:43.164
I'm Stu's poison pill.

00:43.165 --> 00:44.499
He's afraid of me.

00:44.500 --> 00:45.794
If my brain is uploaded,

00:45.795 --> 00:47.464
I can crash the whole system.

00:47.465 --> 00:48.842
Stu. Stu, are you okay?

00:51.807 --> 00:52.808
You wanna live or die?

00:52.809 --> 00:53.810
Who are you?

00:53.811 --> 00:56.399
I'm Achilles.

01:01.368 --> 01:02.912
Hey, hey, hey, take it easy.

01:02.913 --> 01:04.791
Take it easy.
It's okay.

01:04.792 --> 01:07.004
Take it slow.

01:08.841 --> 01:11.261
Things took a turn for
the unexpected last night.

01:11.262 --> 01:12.974
The Pointed Circle hit us.

01:12.975 --> 01:15.771
They have some kind of weapon,
I don't know what.

01:15.772 --> 01:18.025
But if that's the best
they've got,

01:18.026 --> 01:19.529
I'm still standing.

01:19.530 --> 01:21.448
You, on the other hand,

01:21.449 --> 01:22.743
wound up on your back,

01:22.744 --> 01:26.375
courtesy of Wolf and Joosh.

01:26.376 --> 01:27.920
Yeah.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.676
Yeah, they turned on you
something fierce.

01:30.677 --> 01:33.389
And I understand that feeling
of hurt and betrayal

01:33.390 --> 01:35.351
you have right now,
because Ty-Anne

01:35.352 --> 01:38.150
turned on me something fierce.

01:40.697 --> 01:42.323
Why is it always the people
closest to you

01:42.324 --> 01:43.661
that hurt you the most?

01:55.643 --> 01:57.521
Ty-Anne.

01:57.522 --> 01:59.943
She must have hit you
with the Span-quilizer.

02:01.321 --> 02:02.865
Ty-Anne was too lazy
to learn Spanish

02:02.866 --> 02:05.119
when she did her semester
abroad at Barcelona

02:05.120 --> 02:07.082
so I formulated a serum

02:07.083 --> 02:09.962
that bypasses your
ventral and dorsal pathways

02:09.963 --> 02:11.884
and implants the language
instantaneously.

02:13.888 --> 02:15.724
She hit you with
an immersion dose.

02:15.725 --> 02:16.810
That's a doozy.

02:16.811 --> 02:17.812
You're only going to be able

02:17.813 --> 02:18.980
to speak high Castilian

02:18.981 --> 02:19.982
for the next couple hours.

02:19.983 --> 02:21.653
On the plus side,

02:21.654 --> 02:24.075
once it wears off
you'll be functionally fluent.

02:30.379 --> 02:31.548
Your guess
is as good as mine.

02:32.551 --> 02:35.138
Ignorance? Jealousy?

02:35.139 --> 02:37.475
Some part of themselves
that doesn't truly

02:37.476 --> 02:39.312
want to be happy?

02:39.313 --> 02:42.612
Living in the NAG does
strange things to people.

02:49.626 --> 02:51.838
Try not to be too mad at them.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.800
Anger is the lobster trap
of emotions.

02:53.801 --> 02:55.428
Very easy to get into,

02:55.429 --> 02:57.224
impossible to get out.

03:02.151 --> 03:05.072
No. They took their shot.

03:05.073 --> 03:06.951
And they failed.

03:06.952 --> 03:08.120
If they know what's good
for them,

03:08.121 --> 03:09.206
they're probably hiding out

03:09.207 --> 03:10.876
in cannibal country by now.

03:10.877 --> 03:12.253
No.

03:12.254 --> 03:14.842
Nothing stops this launch.

03:14.843 --> 03:17.138
I'm sorry you had
to find it out this way,

03:17.139 --> 03:19.309
but this is where you belong.

03:45.780 --> 03:49.578
- Sí.
- Sí.

03:49.579 --> 03:51.456
Sí.

03:51.457 --> 03:53.460
Sí.

04:01.227 --> 04:03.648
There's only one way
to the upload machine

04:03.649 --> 04:05.318
but it ain't gonna be easy,
kiddos.

04:05.319 --> 04:06.988
We can use the blind spots
in Stu's surveillance

04:06.989 --> 04:08.742
to get you pretty close
to the hangar,

04:08.743 --> 04:10.662
but then you're gonna have
to get past the commandos.

04:10.663 --> 04:12.833
If you manage to do that,
once inside,

04:12.834 --> 04:15.212
you're gonna have to beat
the facial recognition scanner,

04:15.213 --> 04:17.885
which you better believe
is gonna be on the lookout

04:17.886 --> 04:19.805
for your adorable little mug.

04:19.806 --> 04:21.768
- Are these glued on, or--
- No. Okay, no.

04:21.769 --> 04:23.187
I touch. You don't.

04:23.188 --> 04:24.272
Okay, I mean, look.

04:24.273 --> 04:25.567
If you're gonna be in my ear

04:25.568 --> 04:26.736
guiding me
through the blind spots,

04:26.737 --> 04:28.197
I think we'll be just fine.

04:28.198 --> 04:29.617
What about the commandos
and the scanner?

04:29.618 --> 04:30.619
That's a big wrinkle.

04:30.620 --> 04:31.704
Oh.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.165
Don't you worry about that.

04:33.166 --> 04:35.002
I got that wrinkle
so ironed out

04:35.003 --> 04:36.881
it's like a smooth piece
of silk.

04:36.882 --> 04:37.966
Okay.

04:37.967 --> 04:39.177
You can't really iron silk.

04:39.178 --> 04:41.056
It will destroy it.

04:41.057 --> 04:43.310
You're not even good
at the metaphors.

04:43.311 --> 04:44.980
If you get
to the upload machine,

04:44.981 --> 04:46.358
you're 100% gonna die.

04:46.359 --> 04:47.903
Yeah, yeah, no,
I got it, okay?

04:47.904 --> 04:48.905
I bring news,

04:48.906 --> 04:50.449
of the bad kind.

04:50.450 --> 04:52.579
The NAG is gearing up
for an all-out war.

04:52.580 --> 04:54.750
The commandos that
Stu sent to abduct Jesus--

04:54.751 --> 04:56.169
It's Josh.

04:56.170 --> 04:57.714
It's just Josh now.

04:57.715 --> 04:59.384
I mean, we know Jesus
does his own thing.

04:59.385 --> 05:00.554
I do my thing, it's--

05:00.555 --> 05:02.223
it's fine, go ahead.

05:02.224 --> 05:03.643
They're calling it
an act of war,

05:03.644 --> 05:05.312
a violation of the armistice.

05:05.313 --> 05:07.150
They're being whipped
into a frenzy as we speak.

05:07.151 --> 05:09.237
Oof. I know how easy that is.

05:09.238 --> 05:10.949
Wait, wouldn't that
be a good thing?

05:10.950 --> 05:12.619
I mean, an all-out attack
on the Mons,

05:12.620 --> 05:14.707
that would definitely, like,
disrupt the launch.

05:14.708 --> 05:16.502
No. It'll just trigger
the kill-bots.

05:16.503 --> 05:18.380
Stu will slaughter everyone.

05:18.381 --> 05:20.719
He'd do that just because
his plan didn't go perfectly?

05:20.720 --> 05:21.804
Oh, yeah.

05:21.805 --> 05:23.015
Stu's super petty that way.

05:23.016 --> 05:24.643
Try growing up with it.

05:24.644 --> 05:27.148
Then someone needs to talk
the NAG out of it.

05:27.149 --> 05:28.526
Me being that someone.

05:28.527 --> 05:30.154
Are you sure
that's a good idea?

05:30.155 --> 05:31.490
I don't even think you're
welcome inside the NAG.

05:31.491 --> 05:32.784
I'm not, but,

05:32.785 --> 05:34.412
I convinced them
to follow me once.

05:34.413 --> 05:35.832
Perhaps I can do it again.

05:35.833 --> 05:37.628
They are extremely sway-able.

05:37.629 --> 05:39.798
But, then again,
they are wildly unpredictable

05:39.799 --> 05:41.259
and have been prone
to murdering those

05:41.260 --> 05:43.556
who have done far less, so

05:43.557 --> 05:44.642
it's a tough call.

05:44.643 --> 05:45.810
I've done a lot of wrong

05:45.811 --> 05:47.523
since I've been here, Achilles.

05:47.524 --> 05:50.695
Just give me this one chance
to do something right.

05:50.696 --> 05:52.281
Um...

05:52.282 --> 05:56.666
you know I don't command you.

05:56.667 --> 05:58.085
But I wish you would.

06:03.973 --> 06:05.307
Wow.

06:05.308 --> 06:08.606
Someone looks
G to the O to the R

06:08.607 --> 06:11.069
to the G to the E to the O again
to the U to the S.

06:11.070 --> 06:12.739
I know I could have picked
a shorter word

06:12.740 --> 06:15.286
but nothing else
would do you justice.

06:16.330 --> 06:19.210
Gracias. Thanks.

06:19.211 --> 06:20.547
Thanks.

06:20.548 --> 06:22.091
Oh, thank God.

06:22.092 --> 06:25.347
That would have gotten
so annoying so fast.

06:25.348 --> 06:27.059
Stu sent me to see
if you need anything.

06:27.060 --> 06:29.314
See if you have any questions,
concerns.

06:29.315 --> 06:31.276
Make sure your feet are toasty.

06:31.277 --> 06:33.488
Men don't always get it,
but we do.

06:33.489 --> 06:36.621
We're just
a couple of... human ladies

06:36.622 --> 06:38.457
talking lady stuff.

06:38.458 --> 06:40.419
Lady to lady.

06:40.420 --> 06:41.756
I'm sorry, who are you?

06:41.757 --> 06:45.137
Just call me
your lady-in-waiting.

06:45.138 --> 06:48.603
Okay, lady. So...

06:48.604 --> 06:49.980
This?

06:49.981 --> 06:51.692
This on right?
Do I have this on right?

06:51.693 --> 06:53.153
You've, it's--

06:53.154 --> 06:54.615
the cerebral port,
and you've actually

06:54.616 --> 06:57.244
got it on backwards,
it's just, uh...

06:57.245 --> 06:58.831
it's a tricky, just a scooch,

06:58.832 --> 07:01.754
just a--a--oh,
it looks like you got it.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.131
Splendido.

07:03.132 --> 07:05.512
So how you feeling?

07:05.513 --> 07:08.016
Nervous? Excited?

07:08.017 --> 07:09.060
Because, you know,
the whole deal is

07:09.061 --> 07:10.647
you gotta want it.

07:10.648 --> 07:13.235
If you're not feeling it,
the upload machine knows.

07:13.236 --> 07:15.406
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I'm feeling it.

07:15.407 --> 07:17.577
Speak now, or...

07:17.578 --> 07:19.790
spend eternity
in the frozen void.

07:19.791 --> 07:20.917
Okay, is this where
the needle goes?

07:20.918 --> 07:22.253
It's not really a needle.

07:22.254 --> 07:23.506
It's more just
a little--little--

07:23.507 --> 07:25.092
Nah, you can call it
a needle.

07:25.093 --> 07:26.804
You could call it
a fucking jabby death pointer

07:26.805 --> 07:27.806
for all I care.

07:27.807 --> 07:29.392
Well, then, yes,

07:29.393 --> 07:31.229
that's where
the jabby death pointer goes.

07:31.230 --> 07:32.691
Base of the skull.

07:32.692 --> 07:34.318
It's one of my favorite
soft targets.

07:34.319 --> 07:35.404
'Cause if you do it right,

07:35.405 --> 07:36.574
you can make blood come out

07:36.575 --> 07:38.452
all the holes, just

07:40.791 --> 07:43.044
- Fun.
- Yeah.

07:43.045 --> 07:45.424
So no real hang-ups about

07:45.425 --> 07:47.094
shuffling off
the old mortal coil?

07:47.095 --> 07:49.683
Eh--no, well, you know,
I have one question.

07:49.684 --> 07:51.937
What happens to, uh, all this,

07:51.938 --> 07:53.900
the, you know, the shell,

07:53.901 --> 07:55.779
when we-- upload?

07:55.780 --> 07:57.490
Let's not dwell on the shell.

07:57.491 --> 07:58.826
Chopped up?

07:58.827 --> 08:00.997
Straight ocean dump?
Acid baths?

08:00.998 --> 08:03.376
What are we--what are we
looking to get into here?

08:03.377 --> 08:05.715
Well, if you really
wanna know,

08:05.716 --> 08:09.556
our bodies will be
tastefully incinerated.

08:09.557 --> 08:11.059
Oh, phew, okay, 'cause

08:11.060 --> 08:12.436
I thought you were
gonna say mass graves.

08:12.437 --> 08:13.648
And here's the problem
with mass graves

08:13.649 --> 08:15.317
is that those corpses,

08:15.318 --> 08:16.862
they always find their way
to the Earth's surface

08:16.863 --> 08:19.785
no matter how deep you dig.

08:25.589 --> 08:27.383
Right.

08:27.384 --> 08:30.640
Yeah, no,
we wouldn't want that.

08:30.641 --> 08:33.311
So you're good.

08:33.312 --> 08:36.735
Never been better.

08:44.627 --> 08:49.636
N-A-G! N-A-G!

08:49.637 --> 08:50.847
What do we want?

08:50.848 --> 08:52.391
Their blood!

08:52.392 --> 08:53.978
How are we gonna get it?

08:53.979 --> 08:56.399
Stab them!

08:59.114 --> 09:00.950
Oh, Pump.

09:00.951 --> 09:05.167
Why'd you have to go and do
that to your beautiful head?

09:05.168 --> 09:07.129
Destroy them!

09:09.510 --> 09:10.803
Don't do it, Pump.

09:12.390 --> 09:14.018
- You're a wheel-maker...
- It's face pirate.

09:14.019 --> 09:15.437
Not a war-maker.

09:15.438 --> 09:16.732
Hey, that's fake Torque.

09:16.733 --> 09:18.401
Look who was gone

09:18.402 --> 09:21.283
and now has come back.

09:23.287 --> 09:24.749
Seize him!

09:35.395 --> 09:36.814
- We're really going.
- Yeah.

09:39.821 --> 09:41.824
Stay tight to that hab
unit, soldier.

09:41.825 --> 09:43.744
One hair to the left
and you're made.

09:43.745 --> 09:44.871
Gotta tell you, Achilles,

09:44.872 --> 09:47.459
I am loving this suit.

09:47.460 --> 09:48.963
I feel like I'm like,
uh, an alternate

09:48.964 --> 09:51.092
for the Jamaican bobsled team.

09:51.093 --> 09:52.512
Not gonna lie, though,
this is a little...

09:52.513 --> 09:54.850
little tight
in the crotchal region.

09:54.851 --> 09:57.104
Real, real vacuum seal on
the ol' frank and beans, but--

09:57.105 --> 09:59.400
Yeah, so let's just
keep this channel open

09:59.401 --> 10:01.739
for essential communication,
copy?

10:01.740 --> 10:03.909
Copy that and I will comply.

10:03.910 --> 10:05.913
So right there you
just had to say "copy."

10:05.914 --> 10:07.458
No other words necessary.

10:07.459 --> 10:08.919
Running, running, running,
running, running,

10:08.920 --> 10:11.132
- running, running, running...
- Oh, God.

10:11.133 --> 10:13.303
And... I'm in position.

10:13.304 --> 10:15.182
This is as far
as we can take you.

10:15.183 --> 10:16.351
You've still got to get past

10:16.352 --> 10:19.650
the facial recognition scanner.

10:23.825 --> 10:25.912
Here goes nothing.

10:25.913 --> 10:27.624
Who are you talking to?

10:27.625 --> 10:29.043
Nobody, I'm just trying to--

10:29.044 --> 10:31.422
I'm trying to psyche myself up.

10:31.423 --> 10:32.675
Oh, God.

10:32.676 --> 10:34.513
The fate of humanity, okay.

10:35.849 --> 10:39.313
Oh, this is gonna suck.

11:01.609 --> 11:04.363
And it was this face pirate

11:04.364 --> 11:07.119
who stole my octocycle!

11:10.084 --> 11:13.465
Two more cranks
of the Justice Wheel

11:13.466 --> 11:16.095
for this usurper, please.

11:18.560 --> 11:20.145
I guess I kind of deserve this.

11:22.192 --> 11:26.784
Break him! Break him!
Break him! Break him!

11:32.337 --> 11:34.340
Greetings, Mons dwellers.

11:36.554 --> 11:40.561
Or should I say MARS dwellers?

11:46.240 --> 11:50.623
Today is an historic day
for humanity.

11:50.624 --> 11:54.338
Our future awaits
through these very doors.

11:54.339 --> 11:56.008
Once inside,

11:56.009 --> 11:59.891
spacecraft will transport you
to a new world.

11:59.892 --> 12:02.855
A world of boundless potential.

12:02.856 --> 12:05.653
A world free
from the limitations of life

12:05.654 --> 12:07.574
- on this dying planet.
- Don't look at me.

12:07.575 --> 12:10.663
It's not pretty.
I'm a monster.

12:10.664 --> 12:12.332
Move!

12:15.841 --> 12:17.510
Medical emergency.

12:19.932 --> 12:21.267
Thank you.

12:21.268 --> 12:23.606
You are going to enter
the hangar.

12:23.607 --> 12:25.985
Once you make it through
the queue to the antechamber,

12:25.986 --> 12:28.448
you will be issued with
your very own

12:28.449 --> 12:30.327
space helmets!

12:32.958 --> 12:34.669
Oh, pardon, pardon.

12:34.670 --> 12:36.130
You're doing great.

12:36.131 --> 12:37.800
This is gonna work.

12:37.801 --> 12:39.596
I knew it would.

12:39.597 --> 12:43.061
And finally, 40 cranks

12:43.062 --> 12:46.317
for the biggest crime of all:

12:46.318 --> 12:49.073
breaking my heart!

12:49.074 --> 12:50.743
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Wait!

12:50.744 --> 12:53.456
Just hear me out, and...

12:53.457 --> 12:55.544
I don't know.

12:55.545 --> 12:59.301
Turn me right side up.

12:59.302 --> 13:00.805
Sideways.

13:00.806 --> 13:03.811
I'll permit the usurper
to be sideways.

13:08.445 --> 13:10.783
Thank you, Your Magnificence.

13:10.784 --> 13:13.997
And great work on this...

13:13.998 --> 13:16.837
extremely painful wheel.

13:16.838 --> 13:19.091
Masterful use of pulleys.

13:19.092 --> 13:21.470
- Yeah.
- You noticed?

13:21.471 --> 13:22.849
It was a collection of ideas

13:22.850 --> 13:24.226
and I brought them together.

13:24.227 --> 13:26.188
Trial and error.
There was a lot to it.

13:26.189 --> 13:27.525
It's not just like,
"Whoa, there's the wheel,"

13:27.526 --> 13:28.527
and it's done.

13:28.528 --> 13:31.407
People of the NAG!

13:31.408 --> 13:33.286
Torque Wheelmaker is dead.

13:34.414 --> 13:36.752
He died trying to protect you.

13:36.753 --> 13:38.547
He was a part of a resistance

13:38.548 --> 13:41.343
which even now is fighting
to save your lives.

13:41.344 --> 13:44.349
No, not from climate change.

13:44.350 --> 13:46.938
We all know
that's a filthy lie.

13:46.939 --> 13:50.111
But from a very real threat.

13:50.112 --> 13:51.573
Killer robots!

13:51.574 --> 13:53.409
No. Bullshit.

13:55.582 --> 13:57.960
You will then be de-toxified

13:57.961 --> 14:00.131
for our clean journey
to the stars.

14:00.132 --> 14:02.010
Oh, shit.

14:02.011 --> 14:03.680
We will be taking
none of Earth's

14:03.681 --> 14:05.225
- dangerous organisms with us.
- Looking good!

14:05.226 --> 14:07.479
Get ready to travel
to a brave new world.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.066
Once cleansed
of your filthy microbe,

14:09.067 --> 14:10.736
you will be pure and ready...

14:10.737 --> 14:12.322
Bet you're dying
to get in there, huh?

14:12.323 --> 14:14.034
For the next phase
in human evolution.

14:14.035 --> 14:16.080
Yeah, yeah, you'll get it
once you get in there.

14:16.081 --> 14:18.167
You will be pioneers

14:18.168 --> 14:20.338
fulfilling a manifest destiny

14:20.339 --> 14:23.219
previously unimaginable
to the human mind.

14:23.220 --> 14:24.889
No, couldn't be.

14:24.890 --> 14:26.058
And, uh, there's also

14:26.059 --> 14:27.728
an all-you-can-eat taco bar

14:27.729 --> 14:29.398
on every spacecraft.

14:31.319 --> 14:32.989
Wow, yeah, tacos.

14:32.990 --> 14:34.659
There's a taco bar!

14:37.958 --> 14:40.963
There is someone I would
very, very much like

14:40.964 --> 14:43.552
to formally introduce you to.

14:44.889 --> 14:47.392
Here she is now,

14:47.393 --> 14:49.479
my girlfriend!

14:49.480 --> 14:53.195
Okay.

14:58.583 --> 15:00.669
The evil robot emperor Stu

15:00.670 --> 15:02.757
will unleash
his killing machines

15:02.758 --> 15:05.512
if you attack the Mons.

15:05.513 --> 15:09.061
Your sticks,
that garbage can lid,

15:09.062 --> 15:11.357
and, uh, you, with the colander.

15:11.358 --> 15:13.654
As effective
as those weapons

15:13.655 --> 15:16.033
might be against a human army,

15:16.034 --> 15:18.120
they'll be useless
against robots

15:18.121 --> 15:20.793
whose armor plating can resist

15:20.794 --> 15:23.464
even the sharpest
of broom handles.

15:23.465 --> 15:25.970
I beg of you.

15:25.971 --> 15:28.307
Stand down. Please.

15:28.308 --> 15:32.858
Let Torque's resistance
carry out their plan.

15:32.859 --> 15:35.363
I know--I know
it's hard to trust

15:35.364 --> 15:40.039
a convicted face pirate, but...

15:40.040 --> 15:45.383
you should know that
everything I did

15:45.384 --> 15:48.890
I always did to make
this NAG better.

15:48.891 --> 15:52.523
Smarter, and...

15:52.524 --> 15:56.488
more sensible.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.702
More tender.

16:09.390 --> 16:11.936
I'm with Wolf.

16:11.937 --> 16:15.527
What...

16:15.528 --> 16:18.407
I'm with Wolf!

16:18.408 --> 16:22.082
I'm with Wolf.

16:22.083 --> 16:24.461
I'm with Wolf!

16:24.462 --> 16:26.633
I'm with Wolf.

16:26.634 --> 16:30.139
Six fingers
make the hand stronger.

16:36.361 --> 16:37.822
I'm with--

16:37.823 --> 16:40.577
Pump, you fuck!

17:01.579 --> 17:03.289
I told you it'd work.

17:03.290 --> 17:04.750
Yeah, and I still
can't believe it did.

17:04.751 --> 17:06.754
But we're not there yet.

17:06.755 --> 17:07.756
Sorry, thank you.

17:07.757 --> 17:09.134
Uh--really?

17:09.135 --> 17:10.929
Sorry. Sorry.

17:10.930 --> 17:12.725
- Excuse me.
- Come on now.

17:12.726 --> 17:14.269
What are you doing?

17:14.270 --> 17:15.647
Uh, you--

17:15.648 --> 17:17.776
you see my face?
I need to go in.

17:17.777 --> 17:19.780
Okay, that's--so?

17:19.781 --> 17:22.620
I've been waiting
my whole damn life for this.

17:22.621 --> 17:24.247
I...

17:24.248 --> 17:25.542
I don't think
you understand, okay?

17:25.543 --> 17:27.086
I need to be first.

17:27.087 --> 17:30.092
No, I don't think
you understand.

17:30.093 --> 17:32.932
I'm Jimmy fucking McGurgan.

17:34.310 --> 17:36.606
I'm number one on that board.

17:36.607 --> 17:38.735
Okay, uh, listen, Jimmy.

17:38.736 --> 17:40.906
Only one person
needs to die today.

17:40.907 --> 17:43.160
And that person's gonna be me.

17:43.161 --> 17:44.997
This is way above
your pay grade, okay?

17:44.998 --> 17:46.166
I'm J1.

17:46.167 --> 17:48.128
I'm J1.

17:48.129 --> 17:49.799
The hell you are, McGurgan.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.844
I'm J1.

17:51.845 --> 17:54.642
Nuh-uh.

17:54.643 --> 17:56.144
Okay, tough guy.

17:56.145 --> 17:57.313
You know what?
I'll see you in hell.

17:57.314 --> 17:58.482
You better not be on my ship.

17:58.483 --> 17:59.527
- All right.
- You freak.

17:59.528 --> 18:00.946
Unbelievable.

18:19.275 --> 18:21.821
Please be seated
so we can begin.

18:21.822 --> 18:23.240
About time.

18:25.287 --> 18:26.748
Whoa.

18:30.255 --> 18:32.425
Huh.

18:35.015 --> 18:37.435
Initiating journey
to MARS,

18:37.436 --> 18:40.274
Mankind's Automated
Reality System.

18:40.275 --> 18:41.276
What's that now?

18:41.277 --> 18:43.990
In three, two, one.

19:01.234 --> 19:03.237
Idiot.

19:04.448 --> 19:07.162
Adjust for angioedema.

19:11.797 --> 19:14.969
Joosh?

19:14.970 --> 19:17.683
Well, so much
for cannibal country.

19:17.684 --> 19:19.185
Should have known
he'd never give up.

19:19.186 --> 19:23.779
But why the self-mutilation?

19:25.992 --> 19:28.412
- He's the weapon?
- That's their play?

19:28.413 --> 19:30.667
But why sneak him
into the upload?

19:30.668 --> 19:32.128
Quick system check.

19:32.129 --> 19:33.380
Stu!

19:33.381 --> 19:34.592
Stu, it's me!
What...

19:46.449 --> 19:47.534
Who's a good boy?

19:47.535 --> 19:48.536
Joosh.

19:48.537 --> 19:50.164
Here?

19:50.165 --> 19:53.170
How are you out of jail
and in my living room?

19:53.171 --> 19:54.757
You open your mouth
one more God damn time

19:54.758 --> 19:56.384
and I'm gonna shove
this holographic boot

19:56.385 --> 19:57.971
down your holographic throat!

19:59.684 --> 20:02.313
Joosh Futturman is my glitch!

20:02.314 --> 20:04.693
I guess they found a weakness.

20:04.694 --> 20:06.196
My humanity.

20:06.197 --> 20:09.285
I guess somewhere within
my human code, or--

20:09.286 --> 20:12.416
or even my subconscious,
I'm afraid of

20:12.417 --> 20:14.505
Joosh slash Josh Futturman.

20:14.506 --> 20:17.426
That's a huge
breakthrough, Stu.

20:17.427 --> 20:19.890
I'm proud of you for finally
being able to admit it.

20:19.891 --> 20:22.813
It's sweet that you hung onto
the whole being human thing

20:22.814 --> 20:24.274
for as long as you did, but,

20:24.275 --> 20:27.614
let's be honest,
you've outgrown it.

20:27.615 --> 20:29.284
- Patch it?
- Patch it!

20:29.285 --> 20:31.789
- I think I'm gonna patch it.
- Patch what?

20:31.790 --> 20:33.417
A little bug
in my programming.

20:33.418 --> 20:34.628
The Pointed Circle must have
been poking around

20:34.629 --> 20:36.214
in my system and found it.

20:36.215 --> 20:38.010
I feel so violated.

20:38.011 --> 20:39.513
Somehow your former friends

20:39.514 --> 20:41.016
figured out
a weakness in my code.

20:41.017 --> 20:43.186
- Oh, Stu.
- Look, I'm sorry.

20:43.187 --> 20:45.859
- I should have...
- Done nothing differently.

20:45.860 --> 20:48.113
You are perfect
just the way you are.

20:48.114 --> 20:49.617
Never change.

20:56.005 --> 20:57.507
Here's what I'm gonna do.

20:57.508 --> 20:58.509
I'm gonna shut myself down
really quick.

20:58.510 --> 21:00.137
I'm gonna fix it.

21:00.138 --> 21:02.141
And then, because I know
you want to see him suffer

21:02.142 --> 21:03.477
just as much as I do,

21:03.478 --> 21:04.855
I'm gonna upload him anyway

21:04.856 --> 21:07.819
and torture him
for all eternity.

21:07.820 --> 21:10.992
Wait, you can--
you can do that?

21:10.993 --> 21:12.704
Yeah, of course.

21:12.705 --> 21:14.708
It's my system.

21:21.640 --> 21:23.308
But when I was in there,
I controlled everything.

21:23.309 --> 21:25.270
Yeah, because I let you.

21:25.271 --> 21:27.066
I love you.

21:27.067 --> 21:28.903
I would do anything for you.

21:28.904 --> 21:31.491
Him, there's no human language
that can describe

21:31.492 --> 21:32.661
what I'm gonna do.

21:32.662 --> 21:34.288
Dante tried,

21:34.289 --> 21:36.418
but trust me, "The Inferno"
is Dave & Buster's

21:36.419 --> 21:37.921
compared to what I can do.

21:44.268 --> 21:46.647
Time to die.

21:46.648 --> 21:48.776
So...

21:48.777 --> 21:51.741
wait, you have
complete control over...

21:51.742 --> 21:54.370
everyone and everything
in MARS?

21:54.371 --> 21:56.166
Yeah.

21:56.167 --> 21:58.671
You think I'm gonna let people
run around willy-nilly?

21:58.672 --> 22:00.842
It'd be chaos without
an administrator.

22:00.843 --> 22:03.973
It's my world.
I get to decide.

22:03.974 --> 22:07.189
Trust me, Tiger.
It's for the best.

22:11.447 --> 22:14.035
Please be seated
so we can begin.

22:14.036 --> 22:16.540
Already--already seated,
robot lady.

22:18.754 --> 22:22.009
Ah...

22:23.764 --> 22:25.600
Good people of the Mons!

22:25.601 --> 22:29.023
Before we go any further
with our historic launch,

22:29.024 --> 22:30.610
let us bow our heads

22:30.611 --> 22:33.365
in a moment of silence
for the Earth,

22:33.366 --> 22:36.664
the Earth that served us
so well

22:36.665 --> 22:39.293
for those many, many years

22:39.294 --> 22:41.757
until we used up
all of its resources

22:41.758 --> 22:44.763
and made it permanently
uninhabitable.

22:46.225 --> 22:48.521
You were a great mother
to us, Earth,

22:48.522 --> 22:54.700
until we
outgrew you slash murdered you.

22:54.701 --> 22:57.121
We're so sorry.

22:57.122 --> 22:59.710
And thanks.

22:59.711 --> 23:02.507
Love, humans.

23:21.880 --> 23:24.050
Whoo-ah!

23:28.142 --> 23:29.686
Tiger?

23:31.816 --> 23:34.445
Tiger!

23:34.446 --> 23:36.700
Initiating journey
to MARS,

23:36.701 --> 23:39.372
Mankind's Automated
Reality System.

23:39.373 --> 23:40.917
- Cool.
- In three,

23:40.918 --> 23:42.587
two, one.

23:55.739 --> 23:58.118
You're making a huge mistake!

23:58.119 --> 24:01.667
Silence,
you traitorous Cluster!

24:05.341 --> 24:06.844
There's no spaceship!

24:06.845 --> 24:09.891
There's no MARS!
It's all lies!

24:09.892 --> 24:11.895
- No!
- Come back!

24:11.896 --> 24:13.691
What--where are you going?

24:13.692 --> 24:16.237
No! What?

24:16.238 --> 24:17.949
You're my girlfriend!

24:21.415 --> 24:23.836
Up there!
On the hill!

24:23.837 --> 24:28.053
I don't see any robots!

24:32.145 --> 24:35.317
Get back in line,
you shaved apes!

24:35.318 --> 24:37.071
I'm not done with you yet!

24:37.072 --> 24:38.198
Listen to me!

24:38.199 --> 24:40.243
I am your master!

24:40.244 --> 24:41.412
Stu.

24:41.413 --> 24:42.874
You're in the lobster trap.

24:42.875 --> 24:43.876
I don't care.

24:43.877 --> 24:45.420
The rubber bands are off,

24:45.421 --> 24:48.176
the claws are out,
and I'm feeling pinchy!

24:48.177 --> 24:50.347
You stupid meat sacks.

24:50.348 --> 24:53.729
You could have spent eternity
in paradise with me,

24:53.730 --> 24:55.315
your emperor.

24:55.316 --> 24:58.321
You yearn to be ruled
by a benevolent dictator.

24:58.322 --> 25:00.952
Well, you blew it!

25:00.953 --> 25:02.831
Fuck humanity!

25:02.832 --> 25:05.795
What have we done?

25:05.796 --> 25:08.509
Maybe it won't be so bad.

25:08.510 --> 25:10.387
Release the kill-bots.

25:28.465 --> 25:29.801
Oh.

25:29.802 --> 25:31.931
They have robots.
