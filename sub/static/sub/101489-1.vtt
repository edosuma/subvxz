37:40.661 --> 37:41.928
That's just a prototype.

37:41.962 --> 37:43.964
The real card
could be manufactured

37:43.997 --> 37:46.399
‐from a lighter material.
‐For instance,

37:46.432 --> 37:48.001
there's are a lot
of exciting things happening

37:48.034 --> 37:50.604
these days in plastics.

37:50.637 --> 37:53.306
And you're saying
the bank, uh...

37:53.339 --> 37:55.341
What are you saying?

37:55.375 --> 37:58.645
LOY:
What you hold in your hand
right now is something I call

37:58.679 --> 38:01.014
a financial instrument.

38:01.047 --> 38:04.350
It is a product your bank
will offer to customers.

38:04.384 --> 38:06.386
(pneumatic tube rumbling)

38:13.660 --> 38:15.762
Uh, just think of it as

38:15.796 --> 38:19.399
an open line of credit
paid back weekly.

38:19.432 --> 38:21.702
Or monthly.

38:37.017 --> 38:39.753
I don't understand.

38:39.786 --> 38:41.755
If you got your own bank,

38:41.788 --> 38:43.824
what do you need us for?

38:43.857 --> 38:46.993
Simple. I've already
got a customer base.

38:47.027 --> 38:49.730
What I need help with
is convincing white businesses

38:49.763 --> 38:51.965
to take the card
as a means of payment

38:51.998 --> 38:54.000
so we can expand
into your community

38:54.034 --> 38:55.902
and then go national.

38:55.936 --> 38:58.739
I was thinking a partnership,

38:58.772 --> 39:00.774
60‐40.

39:06.747 --> 39:08.749
No.

39:10.183 --> 39:11.618
No?

39:13.486 --> 39:15.856
I'm offering you
a million‐dollar idea.

39:15.889 --> 39:17.958
‐A billion‐dollar idea.

39:19.726 --> 39:21.628

imagination. (chuckles)

39:21.662 --> 39:23.797

I see day in, day out‐‐

39:23.830 --> 39:25.699
hardworking people, family men‐‐

39:25.732 --> 39:29.636

spend money they don't have.

39:29.670 --> 39:30.904
‐Mr. Winckle...
‐WINCKLE: And charging 'em

39:30.937 --> 39:32.906

preying on 'em

39:32.939 --> 39:34.641

39:34.675 --> 39:37.844
that's just not what banking's
all about. (chuckles)

We got the pellet out, but

40:30.564 --> 40:32.599
he's lost a lot of blood.

40:34.968 --> 40:38.038
I want a real doctor.

40:38.071 --> 40:42.042
I assure you, I'm as real
a doctor as you can get.

40:42.075 --> 40:43.544
Is he gonna die?

40:43.577 --> 40:45.846
I'd like to keep him here
a few days.

40:45.879 --> 40:48.715
Uh, as I said,
he's lost a lot of blood.

40:48.749 --> 40:50.784
What matters is he rests.

41:09.135 --> 41:11.171

I'll take care of it myself.

41:14.741 --> 41:16.843
Send everyone else home.

41:16.877 --> 41:20.080
And what about your mama?

41:20.113 --> 41:23.149
Tell Maxia. She'll talk to Ma
and the others.

41:23.183 --> 41:25.952
They can come in the morning,
if he makes it.

41:36.162 --> 41:38.732

Oh, excuse me,

41:38.765 --> 41:40.166
‐young fella,
chuck wagon coming through.
‐Oh, sorry.

41:40.200 --> 41:42.969
Oh, God, no need for sorry.

41:43.003 --> 41:45.271
What with you worrying
and grieving.

41:45.305 --> 41:48.141
Hey.

41:52.345 --> 41:53.847
You got any bennies?

41:53.880 --> 41:55.716
Zoomers?
A little chicken powder?

41:55.749 --> 41:57.017
You know,
something to pick me up.

41:57.050 --> 41:59.886
I've had a world‐class day.

41:59.920 --> 42:02.856
Well, sir, those...

42:04.057 --> 42:05.792
...those types of narcotics‐‐

42:05.826 --> 42:08.328
when prescribed
as a medical remedy,

42:08.361 --> 42:11.131
say, as a mood elevator or to
strengthen the concentration‐‐

42:11.164 --> 42:13.767
can be quite effective,
but ingesting them

42:13.800 --> 42:15.068
without the written prescription

42:15.101 --> 42:18.038
of a certified physician‐‐
(clicks tongue)

42:18.071 --> 42:20.741
that's not something
I can help you with.

42:22.909 --> 42:23.877
Psst.

42:28.181 --> 42:30.150
What if I share?

42:34.320 --> 42:35.188
(snorts)

42:35.221 --> 42:38.091
‐Holy Christmas.
‐Mm‐hmm.

42:38.124 --> 42:40.293
When using illicit substances,

42:40.326 --> 42:43.063
it's very important to avoid
obvious physical tells:

42:43.096 --> 42:45.832
redness of the eyes,
inflamed epidermal tissue,

42:45.866 --> 42:47.834
say around the proboscis.

42:47.868 --> 42:50.070
‐You got a funny way of talking.
‐Yep.

42:50.103 --> 42:53.206

42:55.942 --> 42:59.312
Well, I've found in my 36 years
on God's green Earth

42:59.345 --> 43:00.947
that it's absolutely critical

43:00.981 --> 43:02.683
to be precise
in your use of language

43:02.716 --> 43:06.219
so as to avoid
instances of misreckoning.

43:06.252 --> 43:07.821

‐Huh? No.

43:14.160 --> 43:16.196
Oh, no.

43:20.867 --> 43:22.368

‐My father.
‐Mm.

I don't know.
Children, I think.

43:34.280 --> 43:35.749
That's not what matters.

to see him like that.
