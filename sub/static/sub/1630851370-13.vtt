00:01.602 --> 00:03.504
<i>Back in the '80s,
my mom was a master consoler.</i>

00:03.637 --> 00:05.606
<i>Following my breakup
with Brea,</i>

00:05.739 --> 00:09.243
<i>she was gearing up
for a smothering tsunami
of sympathy.</i>

00:09.377 --> 00:10.844
Good morning, Beverly.

00:10.978 --> 00:12.980
I'm here to pick up Murray
for our new carpool.

00:13.114 --> 00:15.316
Oh, he already left.

00:15.449 --> 00:18.486
But I bought doughnuts
and readied two
conversation starters,

00:18.619 --> 00:20.621
like, "What did you do
this past weekend?"

00:20.754 --> 00:23.357
and the more adventurous,
"What are you doing
this upcoming weekend?"

00:23.491 --> 00:25.126
Nothing and nothing.

00:25.259 --> 00:26.927
But I'm glad you're here.

00:27.061 --> 00:30.030
Does this sweater seem
soft and cozy enough
to heal a boy's heartache?

00:30.164 --> 00:32.433
What are we talking about?
Adam and his girlfriend
broke up.

00:32.566 --> 00:35.736
Oh, no!
Brea Bee and Adam G.
were the gold standard.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.805
I'm swooping in
to cushion the blow

00:37.938 --> 00:40.874
with kissies
and my custom-made
hugging sweater,

00:41.008 --> 00:43.010
with decorative tissues
for when the tears start.

00:43.144 --> 00:45.813
Mornin', folks!
What a beautiful day
in Jenkintown,

00:45.946 --> 00:47.848
the Paris of the
Montgomery County
flood basin.

00:47.981 --> 00:49.983
Go ahead.
Sob away the pain.

00:50.118 --> 00:52.653
Let my body
restart your heart
with its warmth.

00:52.786 --> 00:55.423
Gah! How do you generate
so much heat?
And what are you doing?

00:55.556 --> 00:57.658
Soothing your
teenage emotions.

00:57.791 --> 01:00.528
I'm okay.
Adam, you don't have to
pretend to be brave with me.

01:00.661 --> 01:02.830
Come on. Rest your face
in my nooks and crannies.

01:02.963 --> 01:04.098
No!

01:04.232 --> 01:06.234
And I'm not brave,
I'm notoriously a coward.

01:06.367 --> 01:07.768
I have seven night lights.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.003
And just FYI, Brea's on
her way here right now.

01:10.138 --> 01:11.505
How dare she!

01:11.639 --> 01:13.474
Well, don't worry.
I'll avenge your pain

01:13.607 --> 01:16.244
by calling out
her blotchy skin
and limp hair.

01:16.377 --> 01:18.879
I don't know, Beverly.
The boy seems fine.

01:19.012 --> 01:20.114
I am!

01:20.248 --> 01:22.550
Everyone talks about
how hard breakups are,

01:22.683 --> 01:24.885
so instead, we decided
to cut right to us
being friends.

01:25.018 --> 01:27.255
Ugh! You are totally
in denial!

01:27.388 --> 01:29.557
Or am I incredibly evolved

01:29.690 --> 01:31.459
and can easily navigate
modern romance?

01:31.592 --> 01:33.661
There needs to be
a mourning period

01:33.794 --> 01:35.663
where you stay
at home with me
and watch soap operas,

01:35.796 --> 01:38.766
and then I remind you
of how special you are

01:38.899 --> 01:41.369
by writing on your tummy
with my invisible finger pen.

01:41.502 --> 01:44.172
What an incredibly
tempting offer
for a voting-age man.

01:44.305 --> 01:45.038
But no!

01:47.040 --> 01:48.276
Morning, pal!

01:48.409 --> 01:49.377
Good morning, old chum!

01:49.510 --> 01:50.644
Ready to get to school
and begin

01:50.778 --> 01:52.079
a platonic day
of friendship together?

01:52.213 --> 01:54.615
I'd like nothing more.
This feels right, compadre.

01:54.748 --> 01:56.617
Homeboy, homeslice,
homeskillet.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.619
This totally works.
Hang on a sec.

01:58.752 --> 02:00.188
Adam, let's make her jealous

02:00.321 --> 02:02.490
by showing her
how you can stand on my feet,

02:02.623 --> 02:03.624
and we'll walk
into the kitchen.

02:03.757 --> 02:04.992
I just forgot my coat.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.494
Brea, look away!

02:06.627 --> 02:09.630
Come on, stand
on Mama's feet.
Here we go.

02:09.763 --> 02:11.565
<i>♪ I'm twisted up inside</i>

02:11.699 --> 02:14.568
<i>♪ But nonetheless
I feel the need to say</i>

02:17.271 --> 02:18.839
<i>♪ I don't know the future</i>

02:18.972 --> 02:22.009
<i>♪ But the past keeps getting
clearer every day ♪</i>

02:22.142 --> 02:24.612
<i>It was February,
1980-something,</i>

02:24.745 --> 02:26.714
<i>and Barry and Erica
were at the Schwartz house,</i>

02:26.847 --> 02:29.517
<i>gearing up for
a romantic Valentine's Day.</i>

02:29.650 --> 02:30.784
<i>Or so they thought.</i>

02:30.918 --> 02:32.353
Happy Valentine's Week,
Goldbergs!

02:32.486 --> 02:33.687
"Week"?

02:33.821 --> 02:35.122
It's not just a day?

02:35.256 --> 02:36.390
It's just we love love.

02:36.524 --> 02:38.292
Gross.
Weird.

02:38.426 --> 02:40.961
Great news, my dove.
I have an especially romantic
evening planned for us

02:41.094 --> 02:42.963
that will be sure to warm
the cockles of your heart.

02:43.096 --> 02:45.333
Geoffrey, what did I tell you
about saying "cockles"
in front of Barry?

02:45.466 --> 02:47.435
It's too late.
I heard it.

02:47.568 --> 02:50.304
And do I spy something
adorable and fuzzy for me?

02:50.438 --> 02:51.372
You shouldn't have!

02:51.505 --> 02:52.940
Oh, I actually didn't...

02:53.073 --> 02:56.610
"A cuddly bear
for the cuddliest sister
a brother could have"?

02:56.744 --> 03:00.614
Ooh! Looks like someone's
got her mitts on my annual
Valentine's bear

03:00.748 --> 03:02.115
from my sweet bro!

03:02.250 --> 03:03.951
Happy Valentine's
Week, sis!

03:04.084 --> 03:05.919
Oh, and don't think
that I forgot about you.

03:06.053 --> 03:08.989
Oh! Cool!
Driving gloves!
Yeah.

03:09.122 --> 03:10.824
Hope they don't turn me
into Mario Andretti!

03:10.958 --> 03:13.461
I think it'll be okay.
You haven't made a left turn
in three years.

03:13.594 --> 03:15.763
That's true.
So, you guys exchange
Valentine's gifts?

03:15.896 --> 03:16.830
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

03:16.964 --> 03:18.299
Valentine's is a big event
in this house.

03:18.432 --> 03:20.468
The biggest! Oh!

03:20.601 --> 03:23.136
This is obviously bizarre
and unsettling.

03:23.271 --> 03:24.672
Barry, let's not judge.

03:24.805 --> 03:26.374
I mean, secretly we will,
but for now,

03:26.507 --> 03:27.975
we'll pretend
it's totally innocent

03:28.108 --> 03:29.176
and not shaking me
to my core.

03:29.310 --> 03:31.445
Is that amor I hear
in the air?

03:31.579 --> 03:33.046
It's Valentine's Week!

03:33.180 --> 03:34.848
Bring it in,
my cherubs!

03:34.982 --> 03:36.049
Mwah!

03:36.183 --> 03:37.918
Mwah!
Mwah!

03:38.051 --> 03:40.153
JoJo, let's go
help your mom

03:40.288 --> 03:42.423
with her special
Valentine breakfast!

03:43.791 --> 03:45.993
What the hell, dude?

03:46.126 --> 03:48.929
I don't wanna be mean,
but you and your family
are straight-up freaks!

03:49.062 --> 03:50.998
That's incredibly mean,
and why?

03:51.131 --> 03:54.001
Dude, who's
a better kisser,
your sister, my sister?

03:54.134 --> 03:56.069
It's a trick question.
It's your father.

03:56.203 --> 03:57.471
I'm dying.

03:57.605 --> 03:59.773
I think you even enjoyed
smooching them.

03:59.907 --> 04:02.410
Your dad definitely did,
his eyes twinkled.

04:02.543 --> 04:04.612
Of course he did. He loves us
and wants to express it.

04:04.745 --> 04:09.483
Big time. "Geoffrey!
Bring your puffy
mouth pillows over here!

04:09.617 --> 04:12.219
"Your father wants
everyone's smackers to meet!"

04:12.353 --> 04:14.688
Okay, that's
incredibly accurate
in voice and demeanor,

04:14.822 --> 04:15.956
but the words
are all wrong.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.491
I wanna do Lou.
Please don't.

04:17.625 --> 04:20.694
"Geoffrey, I demand we go
to first base as a family!"

04:20.828 --> 04:22.530
"Geoffrey,
canoodle with your father!"

04:22.663 --> 04:23.964
"Geoffrey,
bite my neck a little.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.099
"Let me know
that you're flirty
but dangerous!"

04:26.233 --> 04:27.568
Okay. That seems
way too far.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.069
And yet
there's still more.

04:29.202 --> 04:32.406
"Geoffrey, we're both eye men,
but today we become lip men!

04:32.540 --> 04:34.107
"Come give your papa
some action!"

04:34.241 --> 04:35.376
That's your father!

04:35.509 --> 04:37.511
He gives you affection!

04:37.645 --> 04:39.880
<i>While Barry and Erica
were giving Geoff grief,</i>

04:40.013 --> 04:42.416
<i>Brea and I had found happiness
in our new friendship.</i>

04:42.550 --> 04:43.951
I gotta be honest,
I was a smidge nervous

04:44.084 --> 04:45.919
about us going
right from dating
to friends,

04:46.053 --> 04:47.488
but this breakup has been
the easiest.

04:47.621 --> 04:50.257
Totally! Because this way,
we can still hang together.

04:50.391 --> 04:52.726
So how do friends
say goodbye?

04:52.860 --> 04:55.496
Uh, is a hug too much?
Hard to know.

04:55.629 --> 04:58.065
But how'd
you feel about a firm
and consensual handshake?

04:58.198 --> 05:00.033
I'd say,
put 'er there, Jack!

05:00.167 --> 05:01.669
Jack!
The nickname to John.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.704
Not sure why,
but strong and masculine,

05:03.837 --> 05:05.272
like this simple,
everyday toodle-oo.

05:05.406 --> 05:06.740
Now it's slightly
less masculine.

05:07.541 --> 05:09.577
That's what I do, Jack.

05:09.710 --> 05:11.445
<i>Yep, it was gonna be easy.</i>

05:11.579 --> 05:12.946
<i>Until it immediately wasn't.</i>

05:13.080 --> 05:14.948
Oh, balls!

05:15.082 --> 05:17.250
We completely forgot
tomorrow is Valentine's Day!

05:17.385 --> 05:19.119
Damn it! I gotta go.

05:19.252 --> 05:20.821
I'll see you in P.E.
for square dancing.

05:20.954 --> 05:22.756
Mama will make it better.
Gah!

05:23.791 --> 05:25.192
Where did you come from?

05:25.325 --> 05:28.095
A good mama's always
just a few meters
behind her babies.

05:28.228 --> 05:29.329
I don't think that's right.

05:29.463 --> 05:30.931
And why meters?

05:31.064 --> 05:33.166
Now let's just get you home
into a warm bubble bath,

05:33.300 --> 05:35.969
then we'll snuggle
under an afghan for two,

05:36.103 --> 05:37.705
and then I'll fill your tummy
with Sleepytime tea,

05:37.838 --> 05:39.339
which I will blow on.

05:39.473 --> 05:41.174
You paint
an inviting picture.

05:41.308 --> 05:43.777
But, no, you know,
even though it's
Valentine's Day tomorrow,

05:43.911 --> 05:44.878
I'll survive.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.346
Survive?
Nonsense!

05:46.480 --> 05:48.115
You will thrive!

05:48.248 --> 05:50.183
By spending it
with your first
and greatest love.

05:50.984 --> 05:52.185
Me.
Nah.

05:52.319 --> 05:54.021
I'll just find something else
to distract me.

05:54.154 --> 05:56.690
Well, tomorrow is also
Florence Henderson's
birthday.

05:56.824 --> 05:58.426
The mom from
<i>The Brady Bunch?</i>

05:58.559 --> 06:00.060
How do you know that?
I know the birthdays

06:00.193 --> 06:01.294
of every great mother
in history.

06:01.429 --> 06:02.863
That scarily tracks.

06:02.996 --> 06:05.198
I guess celebrating
Florence Henderson's b-day

06:05.332 --> 06:06.634
is one way
to keep my mind busy.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.402
Her mom mullet
and winning smile

06:08.536 --> 06:11.739
will fill your heart more
than Brea ever could.
Whatever.

06:11.872 --> 06:14.041
There ya go.

06:14.174 --> 06:16.410
<i>While my mom
was trying to make
Valentine's Day disappear,</i>

06:16.544 --> 06:19.379
<i>Barry was excited to reveal
what he knew about Geoff.</i>

06:19.513 --> 06:21.549
JTP!
JTP.

06:21.682 --> 06:24.652
Why are you milling about
like it's cocktail hour
at a wedding?

06:24.785 --> 06:26.386
I called
an emergency meeting.

06:26.520 --> 06:29.389
Yeah, Bar, you use the word
"emergency" very loosely,

06:29.523 --> 06:32.926
so we've decided to not live
our life in constant fear.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.395
But this really is
a deadly emergency.

06:35.529 --> 06:36.964
Deadly hilarious.

06:37.097 --> 06:38.532
Just, uh, go ahead
and say all the crazy things

06:38.666 --> 06:40.434
you're gonna say.
Thank you!

06:40.568 --> 06:44.738
While at the Schwartzes',
I witnessed an abomination.

06:44.872 --> 06:47.174
Mm, they still
haven't replaced
that lime-green sectional?

06:47.307 --> 06:49.342
Way worse. They were
all over each other.

06:49.477 --> 06:51.011
Kissing, hugging.

06:51.144 --> 06:54.414
Geoff even planted a smooch
on his own sister.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.016
Aw!
Exactly.

06:56.149 --> 06:58.418
Although you're saying "ew"
wrong, Matt Bradley.

06:58.552 --> 07:00.187
I don't think I am.

07:00.320 --> 07:02.890
Geoff! That's your cue
to come out of the bathroom!

07:03.023 --> 07:04.825
Hi! I was told you guys
have a present for me?

07:04.958 --> 07:06.627
The present
of merciless insults.

07:06.760 --> 07:07.761
Go ahead!

07:07.895 --> 07:10.363
Tease him till he pees
or weeps or both.

07:10.498 --> 07:12.432
I'm not gonna
tease my friend
until he soils himself.

07:12.566 --> 07:13.767
Why not?
He locked lips with his dad

07:13.901 --> 07:15.703
like he was Bo Derek
on a beach.

07:15.836 --> 07:17.370
It was a peck
of familial love.

07:17.505 --> 07:19.873
He admitted it!
I don't know, Bar.

07:20.007 --> 07:22.375
I mean, all of us have
pretty good relationships
with our families.

07:22.510 --> 07:24.444
My sister
is my best friend.

07:24.578 --> 07:26.480
I tell her things I wouldn't
even tell you guys.

07:26.614 --> 07:28.682
We even have
a secret language.

07:28.816 --> 07:30.618
Well, not that secret.
It's Spanish.

07:30.751 --> 07:31.952
And the Cogans
are a tiny people,

07:32.085 --> 07:33.987
but our hugging arms
are huge.

07:34.121 --> 07:37.424
I don't have a sister,
but, uh, if I did,
we'd hold hands.

07:37.558 --> 07:38.959
Sometimes I draw us together.

07:39.092 --> 07:40.528
The family therapist
recommended stopping.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.963
A sibling isn't
someone you love,

07:43.096 --> 07:44.965
it's a rival
for your mother's affection

07:45.098 --> 07:47.267
and your father's apathy.
Read a book.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.603
No, a sibling is
the one person you know

07:49.737 --> 07:51.805
who will always have your back
through thick and thin.

07:51.939 --> 07:54.441
Your parents aren't gonna be
around forever, Bar.

07:54.575 --> 07:56.076
But your siblings
are gonna be there
for the rest of your life.

07:56.209 --> 07:58.178
Don't you want that kind
of closeness with Erica?

07:58.311 --> 08:00.948
No! And stop making me
the weirdo here.

08:01.081 --> 08:02.950
Bar, when was the last time
you and Erica

08:03.083 --> 08:05.285
showed each other any type
of real affection?

08:05.418 --> 08:06.453
Or hugged?

08:06.587 --> 08:07.655
Or told each other,
"I love you"?

08:07.788 --> 08:09.489
Usually we're
too busy squabbling.

08:09.623 --> 08:11.759
Her specialty
is vicious insults,

08:11.892 --> 08:14.261
and mine is hiding
outdoor objects in her bed.

08:14.394 --> 08:15.629
Maybe you should think
about changing that.

08:15.763 --> 08:17.064
Because later in life,

08:17.197 --> 08:18.766
your siblings are gonna be
all you got.

08:18.899 --> 08:20.701
<i>As Barry was learning
some hard truths,</i>

08:20.834 --> 08:22.936
<i>I was finding out
just how hard</i>

08:23.070 --> 08:24.304
<i>staying friends with Brea
could be.</i>

08:24.437 --> 08:26.073
Scandalous news!

08:26.206 --> 08:27.274
You know how you and Brea
decided to be friends?

08:27.407 --> 08:29.109
I'm fairly aware,
Dave Kim.

08:29.242 --> 08:30.778
I think Brea's moved on
faster than you.

08:30.911 --> 08:32.345
I intercepted this note
Walls and her

08:32.479 --> 08:35.015
were passing back and forth
in history.

08:35.148 --> 08:36.149
Why is it sticky?

08:36.283 --> 08:37.284
I spilled marmalade
on it.

08:37.417 --> 08:38.652
Why are you eating marmalade
in class?

08:38.786 --> 08:40.087
Just read the note.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.856
"Hey, do you wanna go
to the Valentine's dance..."

08:42.990 --> 08:44.357
The jam obscured
the rest.

08:44.491 --> 08:46.293
Marmalade's not a jam.

08:46.426 --> 08:48.095
Sure, it combines
the sweetness of a jam

08:48.228 --> 08:49.797
with the bitterness
of citrus peel...

08:49.930 --> 08:51.999
Enough marmalade talk,
Dave Kim!

08:52.132 --> 08:54.234
Brea and Walls are clearly
going to the dance together.

08:54.367 --> 08:55.535
I don't believe it.

08:55.669 --> 08:56.770
No? Do you believe that?

08:58.305 --> 09:00.073
But isn't Walls going out
with Sydney?

09:00.207 --> 09:01.241
You mean that Sydney?

09:01.374 --> 09:03.310
Tears!

09:03.443 --> 09:04.477
Walls broke up with her!

09:04.612 --> 09:06.046
Dang,
Brea gets after it.

09:06.179 --> 09:07.681
No, she doesn't.

09:07.815 --> 09:10.350
But, also,
it appears that she does.

09:10.483 --> 09:12.319
Well, two can play
at that game.

09:12.452 --> 09:14.021
If Brea can move on
that fast,

09:14.154 --> 09:17.357
then Adam Goldberg
is gonna show he can
move even faster.

09:17.490 --> 09:19.126
Sydney! Wait up!

09:19.259 --> 09:20.327
You guys hear?

09:20.460 --> 09:22.362
Sydney ran over a rabbit
with her VW Rabbit.

09:22.495 --> 09:24.431
Hmm. There's irony
all around us.

09:26.233 --> 09:29.336
I just want to say I heard,
and I'm so sorry.

09:29.469 --> 09:31.204
That's sweet of you.
It's been tough.

09:31.338 --> 09:32.405
I just went through
the same thing.

09:32.539 --> 09:33.707
You did?

09:33.841 --> 09:35.709
I can't even look
at my car anymore.

09:35.843 --> 09:37.177
Because it reminds you
of him?

09:37.310 --> 09:38.178
And his cute little
puffy tail.

09:38.311 --> 09:39.913
Yeah.

09:40.047 --> 09:42.182
That sounds
super specific to you.

09:42.315 --> 09:44.384
But, hey, you're gonna swerve
into this skid.

09:44.517 --> 09:47.187
Such an odd and insensitive
turn of phrase,
but I guess so.

09:47.320 --> 09:48.622
Sometimes the best thing to do
in these moments

09:48.756 --> 09:49.589
is to have some fun.

09:49.723 --> 09:50.758
Fun? Right now?

09:50.891 --> 09:52.159
Or tomorrow night.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.027
That's why we're gonna hit
the dance together.

09:54.161 --> 09:55.929
But how will that make me
feel better about the rabbit?

09:56.063 --> 09:57.397
Is that your nickname
for Walls?

09:57.530 --> 09:58.732
Adam, what are you doing?

09:58.866 --> 10:00.367
I'll tell you
what I'm doing...

10:00.500 --> 10:02.535
I'm taking Sydney
to the Florence
Henderson dance.

10:02.670 --> 10:03.637
The hell you are!

10:03.771 --> 10:05.572
Easy now, Rabbit.

10:05.706 --> 10:08.408
I figured, if you two
are going, then so are
Sydney and I.

10:08.541 --> 10:09.576
Walls and Sydney
aren't broken up.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.044
But the sticky
confusing note!

10:11.178 --> 10:12.412
I heard that you two
had broken up,

10:12.545 --> 10:14.247
so I asked Brea to join us

10:14.381 --> 10:15.916
so she wouldn't be alone
on Valentine's Day.

10:16.049 --> 10:17.017
Wow.

10:17.150 --> 10:18.652
You're a good egg,
Walls.

10:18.786 --> 10:20.420
I see what you
see in him, Syd.

10:20.553 --> 10:22.956
I'm starting to think
you didn't kill
a rabbit, too.

10:23.090 --> 10:26.059
And I'm starting to think
I have no idea what's
going on here.

10:26.193 --> 10:29.196
Well, know this,
You're a bag
of ass, Goldberg.

10:29.329 --> 10:30.898
You know it!

10:31.031 --> 10:32.833
You know, I thought
we could be friends,

10:32.966 --> 10:34.835
but I don't even want to be
near you right now.

10:38.405 --> 10:40.440
Adam, good news.

10:40.573 --> 10:41.608
I was wrong
about the note.

10:41.742 --> 10:42.976
I know, Dave Kim!

10:45.746 --> 10:47.614
<i>After I made things
worse with Brea,</i>

10:47.748 --> 10:50.350
<i>my mom was determined
to make things better for me.</i>

10:50.483 --> 10:52.252
I'm so confused.
Why am I here?

10:52.385 --> 10:55.655
You have been accepted
for semester at sea.

10:55.789 --> 10:58.425
Congratulations.
Whoo-hoo!

10:58.558 --> 10:59.592
You did it, girl!

10:59.727 --> 11:02.129
The oceans
are your playground.

11:02.262 --> 11:04.832
Semester at sea?
I applied for this
two years ago.

11:04.965 --> 11:07.634
Well, yes, and I just
happened to find it
in your personal file,

11:07.768 --> 11:11.071
so I did you the service of
updating and resubmitting it.

11:11.204 --> 11:13.473
You know, typical
Quaker Warden activities.

11:13.606 --> 11:15.642
You want me
to travel the world now?

11:15.776 --> 11:17.277
In the last three months
before I go to college?

11:17.410 --> 11:18.812
<i>Bon voyage!</i>

11:18.946 --> 11:20.513
Oh, you're gonna have
such a good time

11:20.647 --> 11:22.515
away from this school
and all the pain and suffering

11:22.649 --> 11:24.117
you've been causing.
I get it.

11:24.251 --> 11:26.086
You just want to make me
sail the seven seas

11:26.219 --> 11:27.955
so your schmoopie
doesn't have to see me.

11:28.088 --> 11:30.190
What an outrageous
accusation!

11:30.323 --> 11:32.325
Get your life
together, Brea!

11:32.459 --> 11:34.327
Perhaps on
a research vessel called

11:34.461 --> 11:36.496
the, uh... Oh!
<i>Polar Queen.</i>

11:36.629 --> 11:38.331
I'm not shipping out
my senior year.

11:38.465 --> 11:40.000
I should probably have
more information

11:40.133 --> 11:41.668
before I call students
in here.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.137
There she is.

11:44.271 --> 11:45.638
The girl who loves
to forgive and forget.

11:45.773 --> 11:46.940
Don't, Adam.

11:47.074 --> 11:48.175
Do you know what your mom
just tried to pull?

11:48.308 --> 11:50.744
Hopefully her hamstring
so she wasn't able

11:50.878 --> 11:53.180
to make it in today
to do whatever it is
she clearly did.

11:53.313 --> 11:55.148
She just tried to ship me off
to the North Pole.

11:55.282 --> 11:56.950
That's a real place?
Oh, my God.

11:57.084 --> 11:58.551
I don't know anything
about Christmas.

11:58.685 --> 12:00.520
Why would you put
a tree inside?

12:00.653 --> 12:01.388
This is not working.

12:01.521 --> 12:02.722
What?

12:02.856 --> 12:03.824
We can still
figure it out.

12:03.957 --> 12:05.692
I wish that was true.

12:05.826 --> 12:07.761
There's nothing I want more
than to have you in my life,

12:07.895 --> 12:11.398
but it's just
not meant to be.

12:11.531 --> 12:13.733
<i>While Brea and I had
never been further apart,</i>

12:13.867 --> 12:15.568
<i>Barry was trying
to get closer to Erica.</i>

12:15.702 --> 12:17.004
Oh, hello.

12:17.137 --> 12:19.706
I was about to enjoy
a civilized English tea.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.775
Care to join me?
Why would I voluntarily
spend time with you?

12:21.909 --> 12:25.012
Ha! Our playful teasing
speaks to a deep affection,
doesn't it?

12:25.145 --> 12:27.147
Come on,
park your loveliness.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.149
Whatever.
Crumpet me.

12:29.282 --> 12:31.351
Shall we engage in
the art of conversation?

12:31.484 --> 12:33.086
Just say your thing
while I house this bad boy.

12:33.220 --> 12:35.923
Well, I just feel like
we haven't connected
in a while.

12:36.056 --> 12:38.025
"Haven't connected"?
We've never connected.

12:38.158 --> 12:39.759
Unless you count the time
that my elbow connected

12:39.893 --> 12:41.929
with your ribs because
you smeared peanut butter
on my curling wand.

12:42.062 --> 12:43.063
Trying to heat up
that Jif

12:43.196 --> 12:44.998
was a rare miss
on my part.

12:45.132 --> 12:46.366
But let's not let that
stand in the way

12:46.499 --> 12:48.401
of sharing
our feelings now.

12:48.535 --> 12:49.602
Top off your "shamo-mile"?

12:49.736 --> 12:50.938
It's "cam-o-meal,"
ya dope.

12:51.071 --> 12:52.940
And what's the game here?

12:53.073 --> 12:54.741
When's the big reveal coming
that I drank hot sauce

12:54.875 --> 12:56.309
and butt crumbs?

12:56.443 --> 12:59.079
Nothing's coming
but conversation
and sibling intimacy.

12:59.746 --> 13:00.647
I'm onto you.

13:03.683 --> 13:04.784
Geoffrey!

13:04.918 --> 13:06.419
I need love advice.

13:06.553 --> 13:08.922
Well, you're dating my sister,
so I can only go so far,

13:09.056 --> 13:11.791
but my main tip
is something I call
the across-the-room wink.

13:11.925 --> 13:14.594
No, not to woo Joanne,
who I attend
to effortlessly.

13:14.727 --> 13:15.963
I'm talking about Erica.

13:16.096 --> 13:17.230
Oh.

13:17.364 --> 13:18.431
And, oh?

13:18.565 --> 13:20.067
There's my fella.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.434
What's the deal?
Thank God!

13:21.568 --> 13:22.870
A reasonable person.

13:23.003 --> 13:25.172
Erica and I need
what you two have.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.107
We need to reconnect.
Tonight.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.608
But it's Valentine's Day.

13:28.741 --> 13:30.243
I've been
planning something
for Erica for months,

13:30.377 --> 13:31.845
so maybe it can wait?

13:31.979 --> 13:33.580
Nonsense! Barry's
gonna take your expensive

13:33.713 --> 13:35.115
and non-refundable date.

13:35.248 --> 13:36.816
Yay!
Yay?

13:36.950 --> 13:38.952
Thank you, Geoff.
But also, you're welcome.

13:39.086 --> 13:41.688
I've given you
the gift of being able
to give a gift to me.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.823
Bet it feels pretty good.
Really doesn't.

13:43.957 --> 13:45.993
<i>While Barry set off
to find closeness with Erica,</i>

13:46.126 --> 13:48.161
<i>I was as far from happy
as I'd ever been.</i>

13:48.295 --> 13:49.863
Schmoo?

13:49.997 --> 13:51.398
Oh!

13:51.531 --> 13:53.633
Honey, are you bored?

13:53.766 --> 13:55.468
Do I need to buy you
more toys?

13:55.602 --> 13:58.471
No. I just don't have the will
to get on the bed.

13:58.605 --> 14:00.473
Come on. Get up.

14:01.975 --> 14:03.176
I guess you're mad.

14:03.310 --> 14:04.644
No.

14:04.777 --> 14:07.347
I had already screwed it up
with her 900 ways before that.

14:09.316 --> 14:10.817
Well, what are you gonna do
with your night?

14:10.951 --> 14:13.053
I'm gonna get a head start
on feeling a void

14:13.186 --> 14:15.288
in the center of my being
for the rest of my life.

14:15.422 --> 14:17.290
You can't just give up
on life.

14:17.891 --> 14:19.292
We're going out.

14:20.093 --> 14:21.194
Sure.

14:21.328 --> 14:22.595
Now, why aren't you
fighting me

14:22.729 --> 14:24.264
with every fiber
of your being?

14:24.397 --> 14:25.332
What difference
does it make?

14:25.465 --> 14:26.799
I'm never
gonna be happy again.

14:26.934 --> 14:29.136
You might as well enjoy
whatever weird, screwy thrill

14:29.269 --> 14:31.304
taking your son
on a Valentine's Day
date gives you.

14:32.639 --> 14:34.841
That is the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

14:34.975 --> 14:36.476
Glad I could make
one person happy.

14:36.609 --> 14:39.279
<i>And so, dead to the world,
I limped along</i>

14:39.412 --> 14:41.714
<i>to the greatest
Valentine's date ever,</i>

14:41.848 --> 14:42.882
<i>for my mom.</i>

14:43.016 --> 14:44.351
This is the best!

14:44.484 --> 14:45.718
But you know what would
make it even better?

14:46.954 --> 14:48.621
If you snuggled with me
under this blanket.

14:48.755 --> 14:49.923
Whatever.

14:50.057 --> 14:51.491
Just do
your terrible things.

14:51.624 --> 14:53.560
Alright, enough,
Buster Brown.

14:53.693 --> 14:56.563
I gave you a magical evening,
and you're still moping?

14:56.696 --> 14:58.932
Maybe that's
because I'm on
a Valentine's Day date

14:59.066 --> 14:59.832
with my mother!

14:59.967 --> 15:01.901
Mother? Whoa!

15:02.035 --> 15:03.536
Okay, that's the ride.

15:03.670 --> 15:07.440
I'm sorry. I thought
tonight could be
a distraction for you.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.542
Nothing can distract me
from the pain
I'm in right now.

15:09.676 --> 15:12.545
I know breaking up
is misery,

15:12.679 --> 15:16.083
And I'd do anything to take
that pain away for you.

15:16.216 --> 15:18.051
And the worst part is,

15:18.185 --> 15:21.254
we still desperately
want to be together.

15:21.388 --> 15:22.455
You do?

15:22.589 --> 15:25.225
Yes! It's just,
in three months,

15:25.358 --> 15:26.926
we're going
to different colleges.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.428
No matter what,
we're doomed.

15:28.561 --> 15:31.965
Adam, you want her,
she wants you.

15:32.099 --> 15:33.366
Throw caution
to the wind

15:33.500 --> 15:36.103
and enjoy the next
three months together!

15:36.236 --> 15:37.937
But isn't that
just delaying the pain?

15:38.071 --> 15:41.341
The next three months
could mean everything.

15:41.474 --> 15:43.576
I mean, that's how much time
I have left with you.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.647
I...

15:47.780 --> 15:49.382
I never considered that.

15:49.516 --> 15:50.617
Well, I have.

15:50.750 --> 15:53.220
A lot.

15:53.353 --> 15:55.488
I guess it's why
I forced you out tonight.

15:55.622 --> 15:59.092
So you're just gonna enjoy
every last minute

15:59.226 --> 16:01.494
even though you know
the pain is inevitable?

16:01.628 --> 16:03.396
You're damn right I am.

16:03.530 --> 16:05.898
And you should, too.

16:06.033 --> 16:07.300
Are you saying
I should go to her?

16:07.434 --> 16:09.602
I'm saying
<i>we</i> should go to her.

16:12.272 --> 16:13.840
Hyah! Hyah!

16:13.973 --> 16:15.975
<i>As my mother was hijacking
a horse-drawn carriage...</i>
Whoo!

16:16.109 --> 16:18.278
<i>...Barry was hijacking
Erica's Valentine's date</i>

16:18.411 --> 16:20.580
<i>in a different carriage.</i>

16:20.713 --> 16:22.415
Aw! I had a feeling
this was my surprise.

16:22.549 --> 16:23.783
The real surprise
is it's me.

16:23.916 --> 16:25.185
Barry?

16:25.318 --> 16:27.220
Wait. Is this a part
of my date?

16:27.354 --> 16:28.788
Did Geoff plan for you
to escort me

16:28.921 --> 16:30.590
to the adventure
that awaits?

16:30.723 --> 16:31.958
It's a bad start,
but I'm still excited.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.493
That's exactly
what's happening.

16:33.626 --> 16:34.727
Hop in, sis.

16:34.861 --> 16:35.795
Driver!

16:35.928 --> 16:36.929
Love awaits.

16:38.898 --> 16:40.167
Speaking of,

16:40.300 --> 16:42.535
we love each other, right?
Huh?

16:42.669 --> 16:44.171
Sure, we fight often
and vigorously,

16:44.304 --> 16:45.938
but beneath all that,

16:46.073 --> 16:48.575
there's real caring,
wouldn't you say?

16:48.708 --> 16:50.977
I would say we should
just stay silent until
we get to Geoff.

16:51.111 --> 16:53.080
Definitely.

16:53.213 --> 16:55.348
Until then,
some pretty flowers for
your sniffing pleasure.

16:55.482 --> 16:56.916
Are these
from Geoff or you?

16:57.517 --> 16:58.551
Does it matter?

16:58.685 --> 16:59.952
A lot.

17:00.087 --> 17:02.355
Then perhaps an elegant box
of assorted chocolates?

17:02.489 --> 17:04.257
What?
Again, from you?

17:04.391 --> 17:05.958
There's a map in there
that tells you what's what.

17:06.093 --> 17:08.295
Also, I ate three
because I'm super nervous.

17:08.428 --> 17:09.796
Nervous?
What are you planning?

17:09.929 --> 17:11.998
Just to share
my fondness for you.

17:12.132 --> 17:13.566
Ew! Get off!

17:13.700 --> 17:15.368
I don't want to hold
your gross, sweaty fingers!

17:15.502 --> 17:16.836
I love you!

17:16.969 --> 17:18.671
Okay? Tell me
you love me!

17:18.805 --> 17:20.640
No! What is going on?

17:20.773 --> 17:21.808
Forget it!

17:21.941 --> 17:24.111
Horsey Man,
stop the horsey!

17:24.244 --> 17:25.545
Barry, what is
your problem?

17:25.678 --> 17:27.214
Everyone else loves
their siblings,

17:27.347 --> 17:29.682
but all we have is
a lifetime of pranks

17:29.816 --> 17:30.983
and reading
each other's diaries.

17:31.118 --> 17:32.685
You've read my diary?

17:32.819 --> 17:34.687
Every boring word.

17:34.821 --> 17:36.656
But what does it matter?

17:36.789 --> 17:38.791
It's not like we're
gonna be in each
other's lives anymore.

17:45.198 --> 17:47.667
Hyah! Hyah!

17:47.800 --> 17:49.802
We're a supremely
up family.

17:52.639 --> 17:55.808
<i>Yep, wild horses
couldn't keep me from Brea.</i>

17:55.942 --> 17:58.010
<i>But a tired horse
definitely could.</i>

17:58.145 --> 17:59.212
Hyah! Hyah!

17:59.346 --> 18:00.713
It's clearly out of gas.

18:00.847 --> 18:02.682
It's not used to running
that far on the highway.

18:02.815 --> 18:04.284
This is not the dramatic
and romantic ending

18:04.417 --> 18:05.852
I wanted for you.

18:05.985 --> 18:07.720
Don't worry.
You got me this far.

18:07.854 --> 18:08.855
I can do the rest.

18:08.988 --> 18:09.989
Go, sweetie, go!

18:10.123 --> 18:11.558
Thank you, Mama.

18:11.691 --> 18:13.092
And just know,
I may go off to college,

18:13.226 --> 18:14.227
but me and you
are never breaking up!

18:17.864 --> 18:20.032

18:20.167 --> 18:22.001

What does it matter?

18:24.003 --> 18:25.738
Even those giant posters
of Carol Brady's head

18:25.872 --> 18:27.974
can't change that this is
a really romantic dance.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.242
Are you okay?

18:29.376 --> 18:31.144
Not really.

18:31.278 --> 18:32.212
I just, I can't believe
I'm not here

18:32.345 --> 18:33.813
with the guy I love.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.783
Well, maybe he's closer
than you think.

18:37.684 --> 18:39.186
Oh. Oh, no, no, no.

18:39.319 --> 18:40.553
Dave Kim, you're
a really great friend,
but...

18:40.687 --> 18:41.888
I meant
that Adam's here!

18:47.026 --> 18:48.328
Adam, why are you here?

18:48.461 --> 18:49.896
For you.

18:50.029 --> 18:51.130
We went over this.
I know.

18:51.264 --> 18:52.865
We can't be friends.

18:52.999 --> 18:54.133
But I don't want to.

18:54.267 --> 18:55.134
Well, then what?

18:56.169 --> 18:57.737
I want you back.

18:57.870 --> 18:59.138
All of you.

18:59.272 --> 19:00.006
For as long as we have.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.107
But...
No buts.

19:01.241 --> 19:03.443
Brea, I love you!

19:03.576 --> 19:05.845
And I don't want to miss out
on a single second with you
while we're still here.

19:09.349 --> 19:10.149

19:51.023 --> 19:53.192
I remember
that backyard pool.

19:53.326 --> 19:56.329
Dad was furious because
he had to inflate it
by mouth.

19:56.463 --> 19:57.697
Had to lie down
for two days after.

19:59.332 --> 20:01.033

We don't have
a perfect relationship,

but there's a good reason.

20:04.271 --> 20:05.905
What's that?

20:06.038 --> 20:08.174
You and I are
a lot like Dad.

20:08.308 --> 20:11.944
It's tough for us to let
our guard down
and show we care.

20:12.078 --> 20:13.212
Yeah.

20:13.346 --> 20:15.147
That's why I thought
it'd be nice to try for once.

20:16.649 --> 20:18.084
So what if we start
right now?

20:19.452 --> 20:20.520
Is this a prank?

20:20.653 --> 20:22.054
No prank.

Not cool.
