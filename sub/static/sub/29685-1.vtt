[crack of pool balls]

01:00.500 --> 01:02.083
[Will] Ready?

01:02.166 --> 01:04.000
‐[Alicia] There's no way.
‐[Jeffrey] Uh‐uh.

01:05.833 --> 01:07.166
[Jeffrey laughs]

01:07.250 --> 01:09.333
‐[Alicia] This is ridiculous
‐Mm‐hm.

01:09.416 --> 01:12.000
‐That's actually impressive
‐You're kidding me.

01:12.083 --> 01:15.458
‐Cough it up, baby.
‐Okay. I'm going to give you five.

01:15.541 --> 01:18.541
‐[chuckles]
‐I don’t know how you do it, man.

01:18.625 --> 01:22.500
I’m just blessed. Thank you
for contributing to my slush fund.

01:22.583 --> 01:23.583
Jesus.

01:23.666 --> 01:25.875
[Alicia] Dude,
this place is so disgusting.

01:25.958 --> 01:28.166
Don’t trash the bar. It’s just bugs.

01:28.250 --> 01:31.750
‐You should get an exterminator.
‐That’s above my pay grade.

01:33.958 --> 01:35.541
‐Oh, my God!
‐Oh, gee!

01:35.625 --> 01:38.375
‐[laughs]
‐You're such an asshole!

01:38.458 --> 01:39.500
Oh.

01:39.583 --> 01:43.416
They say when you see one,
there’s thousands more in the walls.

01:43.500 --> 01:46.166
‐Shut up, Jeffrey.
‐[Will] Yeah, shut up, Jeffrey.

01:47.166 --> 01:48.583
Why don't you make me?

01:49.500 --> 01:51.000
Make me shut up.

01:55.375 --> 01:56.958
[clears throat]

02:00.291 --> 02:01.583
Don’t mind me!

02:07.166 --> 02:08.416
Trash coming through.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.958
[man vomits and gags]

02:16.791 --> 02:18.208
How you living, Eric?

02:19.458 --> 02:21.583
‐Large.
‐Expect nothing less.

02:21.666 --> 02:23.291
I’ll be right down.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.750
That shirt comes off, you drink for free.

02:34.833 --> 02:35.916
[giggles]

02:36.000 --> 02:37.500
I'm just saying.

02:37.583 --> 02:39.041
‐Oh, yeah?
‐That's bar policy.

02:39.125 --> 02:42.708
You get naked, it's free drinks all night.
Ain’t that right, Mary?

02:42.791 --> 02:43.666
Damn right.

02:44.500 --> 02:45.625
I don’t make the rules.

02:46.875 --> 02:50.833
‐Give me a shot. Line ’em up.
‐Now we're talking. Now we're talking.

02:51.625 --> 02:55.583
‐Maybe you will see something later.
‐Don't you tease me.

02:58.500 --> 03:01.166
‐Where are you going?
‐I'm just going to the bathroom, babe.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.375
He seems like a good kid.

03:09.875 --> 03:12.000
He is a good kid. [chuckles]

03:12.083 --> 03:13.875
I wonder how long
this one going's to last.

03:15.333 --> 03:20.500
I'm kidding. Come on, look.
May you both live happily ever after.

03:21.250 --> 03:22.333
Cheers.

03:22.916 --> 03:26.833
‐Nah, I'm going to wait for my boyfriend.
‐Well, your loss.

03:26.916 --> 03:28.750
[door opens]

03:29.375 --> 03:30.458
[Will sighs]

03:31.500 --> 03:32.833
Milady.

03:34.041 --> 03:35.916
‐Who the fuck are you, man?
‐Whoa!

03:36.000 --> 03:40.541
‐Hey, Eric, he’s with me! He's with me.
‐That's just Jeffrey. You remember him?

03:44.875 --> 03:49.000
Ah, yeah. Ah, yeah.
How are you doing brother, man?

03:49.083 --> 03:51.291
Fine. Thanks.

03:51.916 --> 03:52.916
Good game.

03:53.541 --> 03:55.625
Scored a goal. I'm here!

03:59.000 --> 03:59.875
I was so close.

03:59.958 --> 04:03.666
You break one more stool, Rosie's going
to make you stand while you're here.

04:03.750 --> 04:05.875
‐Long night?
‐[sighs]

04:05.958 --> 04:08.250
‐Just getting started.
‐Yeah? Usual?

04:08.333 --> 04:10.375
‐Yes, please.
‐Coming right up.

04:13.791 --> 04:18.416
You know what?
You go buy yourself a drink.

04:18.500 --> 04:20.500
[Will] Ah, my man.

04:20.583 --> 04:24.541
And drinks for the progressive couple
over there doing the smooching.

04:25.833 --> 04:29.291
‐You're a real gentleman.
‐It's fine. You don't have to do that.

04:29.375 --> 04:32.250
I know I don’t have to... I want to.

04:32.333 --> 04:35.250
‐[Alicia] Thank you. We appreciate it.
‐Thank you.

04:35.333 --> 04:36.666
[Eric] You're welcome.

04:37.416 --> 04:39.250
That shirt better come off now.

04:42.041 --> 04:45.625
[clears throat] Um, to Eric.

04:45.708 --> 04:47.000
[Will] To Eric.

04:47.083 --> 04:48.208
[Alicia] Cheers.

04:49.041 --> 04:50.666
[Will] Aw, come on, Eric.

04:57.208 --> 04:58.791
Everybody 21?

05:10.250 --> 05:13.416
‐What about everybody else?
‐Yeah, man.

05:14.708 --> 05:16.208
Want me to get them?

05:17.708 --> 05:20.833
Nah, fuck it, you're fine.
What do you want?

05:22.333 --> 05:25.083
Just beer. Four, please.

05:25.166 --> 05:27.916
Just beer? All right.

05:35.250 --> 05:37.833
These are twist‐off.
Y'all should be able to handle that.

05:37.916 --> 05:40.125
Yeah, man, we can handle it.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.041
You know those kids are underage.

05:45.125 --> 05:47.583
Yeah, whatever. They’re harmless.
Let them have their fun.

05:52.583 --> 05:56.000
‐Hit me again, please.
‐Ah, right, yeah. My bad.

05:57.166 --> 05:58.250
[Will] Shit.

05:59.375 --> 06:02.583
I swear we got more bugs than people
in the bar tonight.

06:02.666 --> 06:05.416
[Alicia] That's fucking gross,
bugs fucking on the whiskey.

06:05.500 --> 06:07.166
‐[Eric] Thank you.
‐There you go.

06:08.583 --> 06:10.250
[slurps loudly]

06:15.250 --> 06:17.375
‐[grunts]
‐There you are!

06:17.458 --> 06:19.833
‐What's up, brother?
‐I'm all right. How are you?

06:19.916 --> 06:22.333
‐Good. Give me a hug.
‐Enjoying your last days of freedom?

06:22.416 --> 06:24.000
‐You know it.
‐Good. Good.

06:24.083 --> 06:25.666
‐Hi.
‐How are you?

06:25.750 --> 06:27.791
You fellas let me know
if you need anything else.

06:27.875 --> 06:32.000
We’re good for now, brother.
Let’s shoot some pool! Pool!

06:32.083 --> 06:33.666
Hey, Mary. You want to play?

06:33.750 --> 06:36.625
He's been on, like,
a non‐stop bender for a week.

06:36.708 --> 06:39.375
He’s back on the rig on Monday,
so I think we're safe.

06:39.458 --> 06:41.083
‐Fuck you, Eric!
‐[laughter]

06:41.166 --> 06:45.291
‐Hey, Mary! Come on. They're only kidding.
‐[Alicia] Wait, Mary.

06:45.375 --> 06:46.708
[man] Where you going, baby?

06:46.791 --> 06:51.000
‐You're breaking my heart.
‐Hey, fellas, let’s be cool, all right?

06:51.083 --> 06:53.375
‐It's a family establishment.
‐Sorry, Mom.

06:53.458 --> 06:55.291
Fucking animals.

06:55.375 --> 06:57.208
Hey, what did I just say?

06:58.833 --> 06:59.833
Well...

07:01.041 --> 07:02.666
You’re a dick, Eric!

07:02.750 --> 07:04.000
Whatever, babe.

07:05.416 --> 07:08.291
‐What happened with Mary?
‐He was shoving the cue in her face.

07:08.375 --> 07:13.958
Should we get out
of here maybe, like... go?

07:15.375 --> 07:18.333
‐Can you get this man a drink, please?
‐Yes. I can.

07:18.416 --> 07:21.250
‐No, I have a deadline.
‐Technically it's my job.

07:21.333 --> 07:25.833
I got to work. I'm tired. No, no, no.
I... I have a deadline, so...

07:25.916 --> 07:29.416
Just get wasted and write drunk.
That's what I'd do.

07:29.500 --> 07:32.500
[laughs] It doesn’t sound like
the best advice.

07:33.625 --> 07:38.125
‐Got my ass through college.
‐Well, yeah, that was college.

07:39.041 --> 07:42.875
‐You know he went to Tulane.
‐Really? That's where I went.

07:42.958 --> 07:46.000
Yeah. I think I was there
before your time, sonny.

07:46.083 --> 07:48.291
‐When did you graduate?
‐The year I dropped out.

07:48.375 --> 07:49.875
‐[glass smashes]
‐Oh!

07:49.958 --> 07:51.708
[laughter]

07:54.291 --> 07:56.125
Now what, bitch?

07:56.208 --> 07:57.541
[grunts]

07:57.625 --> 07:59.208
[grunting and groaning]

07:59.291 --> 08:01.083
[Will] Eric, knock it off!

08:01.166 --> 08:03.041
‐[grunting]
‐Eric!

08:03.125 --> 08:05.833
[grunting and laughter]

08:05.916 --> 08:08.041
[angry muttering]

08:08.125 --> 08:09.833
Hey, Eric! Come on, man!

08:09.916 --> 08:11.833
[grunting and laughter]

08:11.916 --> 08:14.708
Somebody get the bottle
out of that guy's hand!

08:14.791 --> 08:16.666
Will, call the cops.

08:16.750 --> 08:20.291
‐Hey, man... Baby, no.
‐[Will] It's the bartender at Rosie’s.

08:20.375 --> 08:22.833
We got a fight breaking out.
Someone’s going to get hurt.

08:22.916 --> 08:26.541
You wanna cut me, huh? You wanna cut me?

08:28.500 --> 08:31.208
[Alicia] Jeffrey! Stop it!
Jeffrey, stop it!

08:31.291 --> 08:32.166
[crashing]

08:32.250 --> 08:33.916
‐Fuck!
‐Jeffrey, stop!

08:34.000 --> 08:35.375
[grunting]

08:36.583 --> 08:40.166
[groans]

08:41.875 --> 08:44.875
[grunts and groans]

08:47.750 --> 08:49.958
Okay, okay, okay, come on. Come on.

08:50.041 --> 08:52.958
‐Come on. Come on. Fighting in the bar.
‐[laughs]

08:53.041 --> 08:55.125
‐Did you call the cops?
‐Yeah. Yeah.

08:55.208 --> 08:56.916
‐Let’s go.
‐Let's go.

08:57.416 --> 08:59.375
[Will] You got him. You got him.

09:00.125 --> 09:02.708
Dude, what the fuck? What the fuck, Dude?

09:02.791 --> 09:04.375
You got to go to the hospital, man.

09:05.083 --> 09:06.875
‐You call the cops?
‐Of course.

09:06.958 --> 09:09.333
‐Should've called an ambulance.
‐Fucking pussy.

09:09.416 --> 09:10.833
Dude, you...

09:11.625 --> 09:14.000
‐[man coughs]
‐Let's go.

09:14.083 --> 09:15.875
[laughter]

09:15.958 --> 09:18.916
[Eric] Quit milking it, man. You're fine.

09:27.583 --> 09:28.916
Here you go, man.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
You all right?

09:30.083 --> 09:31.500
Just fuck off, dude.

09:31.583 --> 09:35.208
Yeah? Why don't you tell that to the cops,
when they get here?

09:35.291 --> 09:37.875
[Alicia] Grabbing a bottle
in a fight is chickenshit.

09:40.583 --> 09:42.958
[grunts and gasps]

09:46.500 --> 09:50.125
The hell was that? You're not
some tough guy. You could've been hurt.

09:50.208 --> 09:52.791
He could've killed him.
What else was I supposed to do?

09:52.875 --> 09:54.833
‐Yeah, okay.
‐You did good, kid.

09:54.916 --> 09:56.125
‐Fuck.
‐You did good.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.833
Oh, fuck.

10:02.916 --> 10:08.083
That's probably one of the kids’. Fucked
up they actually filmed the whole thing.

10:12.250 --> 10:13.416
Fucking millennials.

10:14.916 --> 10:16.041

[Will grunts softly]

11:20.583 --> 11:22.375
Guess who's home.

11:22.458 --> 11:23.875
[Carrie grunts sleepily]

11:23.958 --> 11:25.791
You feel like waking up?

11:25.875 --> 11:27.166
Uh‐uh.

11:28.041 --> 11:29.000
Hm?

11:29.583 --> 11:30.708
Uh‐uh.

11:31.458 --> 11:32.875

[Will sighs]

[sizzle of frying pan]

14:53.666 --> 14:55.666
Good morning, pretty little thing.

14:57.041 --> 15:01.541
Will, the yolk.
You're going to make me burn the eggs.

15:10.500 --> 15:12.458
Whose phone is that?

15:12.541 --> 15:14.916
Just some chick. She left it at the bar.

15:15.875 --> 15:17.333
So you brought it home?

15:17.416 --> 15:20.333
I just picked it up,
but forgot to leave it there.

15:21.416 --> 15:23.791
There was a bit of a fracas
at the bar last night.

15:23.875 --> 15:25.291
‐Cool.
‐Mm.

15:25.916 --> 15:27.500
[yawns] Thank you.

15:29.583 --> 15:30.583
[yawns]

15:36.541 --> 15:39.291
‐How’s your paper coming?
‐I'm nearly there.

15:39.375 --> 15:43.208
I just have to go over it again
and probably rewrite the ending.

15:43.291 --> 15:45.500
Turn it in and hope Steve likes it.

15:46.083 --> 15:47.458
I'm sure he will.

15:47.541 --> 15:50.125
He better. It's a quarter of my grade.

15:51.000 --> 15:51.875
Yeah.

15:55.500 --> 15:57.000
What are you doing today?

15:58.041 --> 16:02.166
Oh, I don't have any plans.
Probably go check on Eric at some point.

16:05.333 --> 16:06.375
Why?

16:07.875 --> 16:11.458
‐He was the one in the fight last night.
‐I thought you said it was a girl.

16:11.541 --> 16:14.541
No, there was a group of college kids,
but they got spooked

16:14.625 --> 16:17.625
and they took off.
Eric got cut pretty bad.

16:17.708 --> 16:21.000
‐It was brutal.
‐Well, that's not shocking.

16:21.666 --> 16:23.500
I should probably still go check on him.

16:28.458 --> 16:32.083
‐What are you doing?
‐Trying to find out whose phone this is.

16:35.541 --> 16:39.500
Why, should I not look? Am I going
to see something I don't want to see?

16:39.583 --> 16:42.791
No. Why are you asking?

16:43.833 --> 16:45.291
I don't know.

16:56.333 --> 17:00.458
‐Why do you know how to unlock it?
‐From the smudge marks on the screen.

17:04.333 --> 17:08.166
‐I'm not lying about the phone, Carrie.
‐Okay. I believe you.

17:11.750 --> 17:12.916
[Will sighs]

17:18.208 --> 17:19.416
Oh! Fuck.

17:20.791 --> 17:22.000
What?

17:22.083 --> 17:23.291
What's wrong?

17:26.291 --> 17:28.375
Who were you talking to last night?

17:32.541 --> 17:33.750
What do you mean?

17:34.458 --> 17:36.250
You were texting someone last night.

17:43.333 --> 17:46.333
‐What is that, Will?
‐Jesus Christ.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.208
I don't...

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
Um...

17:53.083 --> 17:57.291
Don't fuck with it. Give it to the cops.
Somebody got hurt last night.

17:58.083 --> 18:00.083
Yeah. Someone could just be
fucking with me.

18:02.208 --> 18:03.750
Listen, it's Wednesday.

18:03.833 --> 18:07.000
So, Duane will come in after his shift.
I'll give it to him then.

18:07.083 --> 18:09.750
Well, what if that girl
comes to get it first?

18:09.833 --> 18:13.416
I'll just say I don't have it.
Let the cops deal with it.

18:13.500 --> 18:14.333
Okay.

18:14.416 --> 18:17.583
You don't worry
your pretty little face about it.

18:17.666 --> 18:20.041
You let your man handle things.

18:26.541 --> 18:28.166
Baby, I’m going to be late.

18:28.250 --> 18:29.500
‐Yeah.
‐I have to go.

18:29.583 --> 18:33.000
‐Uh‐uh.
‐Will, you truly smell.

18:33.500 --> 18:34.500
God.

18:44.833 --> 18:48.458
He's only coming in that night.
I said we'd have dinner with him.

18:48.541 --> 18:52.791
‐Urgh, dinner with your sober uncle.
‐What is the problem with that?

18:52.875 --> 18:54.666
So he can fucking judge me
the whole time.

18:54.750 --> 18:55.916
‐What?
‐[tires screech]

18:56.000 --> 18:58.666
‐God, Will.
‐Look at these guys.

18:58.750 --> 19:02.125
Here for a higher education
and can't figure out how to cross a road.

19:02.208 --> 19:04.541
‐Know what happens to idiots like that?
‐Tell me.

19:04.625 --> 19:08.458
They spend four years here
to become an economic prisoner.

19:08.541 --> 19:12.166
He should just go work at Rosie's,
get a real job.

19:12.250 --> 19:15.583
‐[both chuckle]
‐I don't think he's Rosie's material. No.

19:15.666 --> 19:18.666
He should stay and fucking take
lessons from dilholes like that?

19:18.750 --> 19:20.000
[Carrie chuckles]

19:20.916 --> 19:23.500
‐Hi, Steve.
‐Hey.

19:23.583 --> 19:26.458
‐Hi, Steve.
‐[chuckles]

19:27.083 --> 19:30.250
‐I'm going to go learn from the dilhole.
‐Yeah.

19:30.333 --> 19:32.041
See you later. [chuckles]

19:33.500 --> 19:34.500
Love you.

19:35.291 --> 19:36.750
[Carrie] Sorry I'm late.

19:36.833 --> 19:38.291
[indistinct chattering]

19:44.583 --> 19:47.166
[ringing tone]

19:50.500 --> 19:52.708
‐[Alicia] <i>Hey, what's up?</i>
Come have a beer with me.

19:52.791 --> 19:56.916
‐[Jeffrey] <i>Babe, who are you talking to?</i>
‐[Alicia] <i>Fuck, dude, what time is it?</i>

19:57.000 --> 20:01.166
‐It's 10:00 a. m. Are you still sleeping?
<i>‐Yeah, I didn't get to bed until sunrise.</i>

20:01.250 --> 20:03.625
<i>Hey, get off the phone.</i>

20:03.708 --> 20:06.708
You going to have a beer with me
or not? I’m pulling up to Rosie’s.

20:06.791 --> 20:10.041
[Alicia] <i>No, asshole, I am not.</i>
<i>I'm going back to sleep.</i>

20:10.125 --> 20:12.166
When did you become such a pussy?

20:12.250 --> 20:14.833
[Alicia] <i>That is so wrong and you know it.</i>

20:14.916 --> 20:17.750
<i>You have one for me.</i>
<i>I'll see you tonight, okay?</i>

20:18.416 --> 20:20.458
‐All right.
‐[giggles] <i>Bye!</i>

20:20.541 --> 20:21.541
Bye.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.250
What the fuck...

20:57.000 --> 20:58.416
How's it hanging there, Rosie?

20:58.500 --> 21:01.083
Oh, right and tight.
Loose, large, pick one.

21:01.166 --> 21:04.083
[chuckles] Anyone come
in looking for a cell phone?

21:04.166 --> 21:06.000
Nope. Lost and found?

21:06.083 --> 21:09.291
‐Yeah.
‐Heard what happened with Eric last night.

21:09.375 --> 21:12.625
‐Oh, yeah.
‐Stop serving him when he’s fucked up.

21:12.708 --> 21:14.750
He’s always fucked up when he’s home.

21:16.166 --> 21:17.166
All right.

21:17.916 --> 21:20.666
I can’t leave the bar.
Can you go check on him?

21:40.958 --> 21:42.041
[door opens]

21:45.166 --> 21:47.166
Holy shit, Eric.

21:47.833 --> 21:50.375
‐[Eric] What is it?
‐You got to go to the hospital, man.

21:50.458 --> 21:51.916
‐I'm calling an ambulance.
‐No.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.958
Fuck that. Dude, your face.
Your face is fucked up.

21:56.791 --> 22:01.291
‐I can see the inside of your mouth.
‐It's swollen. That's all.

22:01.375 --> 22:02.791
I don't know, dude.

22:03.833 --> 22:06.041
[sighs and grunts]

22:06.125 --> 22:08.791
I can get a buddy of mine to stitch it up.

22:08.875 --> 22:13.000
A buddy of yours? Come on, Eric.
You're not in fucking Afghanistan, dude.

22:13.083 --> 22:14.666
Can’t go to a hospital.

22:15.666 --> 22:17.083
They’ll ask questions.

22:17.166 --> 22:20.750
Like what? You want to eat food
without it falling out of your face?

22:30.041 --> 22:31.291
[Eric groans softly]

22:34.000 --> 22:35.125
What?

22:36.666 --> 22:37.750
Nothing.

22:39.583 --> 22:41.958
[grunts] Thank your friend for me.

22:44.583 --> 22:45.750
What friend?

22:47.208 --> 22:49.416
The one who's banging your girl.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.458
She's not my girl, dude.

22:53.208 --> 22:55.250
[chuckles]

22:57.833 --> 22:59.416
[breaths softly]

23:02.291 --> 23:04.708
I just came to check on you.
I'll let you get your rest.

23:04.791 --> 23:06.416
Hey, don't leave.

23:09.500 --> 23:10.958
Nightmares.

23:14.666 --> 23:17.833
Yeah, apparently.
I'll sit with you for a little bit.

23:29.916 --> 23:31.416
You got any more beer?

23:31.500 --> 23:33.500
[snores softly]

23:40.791 --> 23:42.416
Thank you.

23:44.166 --> 23:45.583
[clicks ring pull]

23:55.125 --> 23:57.125

[buzzes noisily]

24:37.541 --> 24:40.375
[rhythmic tap dancing and clapping]

25:01.291 --> 25:03.083
Twenty‐two fifty.
There you go.

25:03.166 --> 25:07.000
Oh, wait. Don't forget to buy
your girlfriend something pretty.

25:07.083 --> 25:09.666
‐He'll love it. [laughs]
‐[chuckles] Yeah.

25:09.750 --> 25:11.833
Oh! He looks good in them tights.

25:11.916 --> 25:13.750
‐Yeah.
‐Yes, he do.

25:20.291 --> 25:21.291
[clerk] Next.

25:23.666 --> 25:25.750
I thought you said you didn’t want a beer.

25:25.833 --> 25:29.458
I think I meant I didn’t want
to have a beer for breakfast!

25:29.541 --> 25:32.208
‐Mm.
‐Hey, Will.

25:32.833 --> 25:33.833
Hey, Jeffrey.

25:34.958 --> 25:40.000
‐Did you get your little project done?
‐Yeah, um, turned it in this morning.

25:40.708 --> 25:43.083
Just, uh, chilling now.

25:43.166 --> 25:47.666
‐That's a gold star for you, right?
‐[giggles] You hear anything about Eric?

25:47.750 --> 25:51.791
Yeah, went and saw him this morning.
His face was all cut to shit.

25:51.875 --> 25:54.708
He's refusing to go to the hospital
because he thinks he's Rambo.

25:56.750 --> 25:58.250
You want to join us?

25:59.750 --> 26:04.083
No. No, no. I’ve got to go.
I've got a bunch of shit to do.

26:04.166 --> 26:07.041
Just came for something to go.
See you guys.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
Hello?

26:49.666 --> 26:50.666
Carrie?

27:11.791 --> 27:12.750

[woman] <i>Shh!</i>

30:03.125 --> 30:05.166
[woman] <i>Shut up.</i>
<i>Do you think we did it right?</i>

30:05.250 --> 30:08.750
[man] <i>I don't know. We did exactly</i>
<i>what it said in the book.</i>

30:08.833 --> 30:12.000

<i>Look at the cockroaches.</i> [giggles]

30:12.083 --> 30:16.458

[scuttling of cockroaches
and indistinct whispering]

30:23.125 --> 30:24.666
[soft pants and gasps]

30:27.416 --> 30:29.166
‐[screaming]
‐[Carrie] Will?

30:32.333 --> 30:33.666
When did you get home?

30:34.916 --> 30:37.500
Right now. What are you looking at?

30:38.500 --> 30:39.375
Nothing.

30:39.458 --> 30:42.000
I thought you were going
to bring that to the police.

30:42.625 --> 30:46.083
‐I am. I'll take it today.
‐Well, what are you looking at?

30:51.583 --> 30:54.000
‐Whose fucking phone is that?
‐I told you.

30:54.083 --> 30:56.166
It's... some chick from the bar.

30:58.625 --> 31:00.250
One of the chicks from the bar?

31:01.708 --> 31:04.375
I can't believe
you're still going on about this.

31:04.458 --> 31:08.375
So, what, all my friends just have
to be guys? Is that the deal?

31:08.458 --> 31:11.333
‐What about Steve?
‐What about Steve?

31:11.916 --> 31:15.666
‐You fucking talk about him all the time.
‐He’s my professor.

31:15.750 --> 31:17.333
He obviously wants to fuck you.

31:18.666 --> 31:22.083
You want to check my phone?
You want to go through my texts

31:22.166 --> 31:26.166
and see if I've sent him any pictures
of my tits? Go on. Look at it.

31:26.250 --> 31:27.833
‐No.
‐Go on. Check it.

31:27.916 --> 31:31.250
I don't want to.
I don't want to because I trust you.

31:31.333 --> 31:33.166
I want to trust you.

31:34.416 --> 31:38.916
But you're being all shady with some
cunt’s phone and acting guilty as shit.

31:43.125 --> 31:44.416
Give it to me.

31:45.916 --> 31:46.791
[sighs]

31:46.875 --> 31:50.708
You don't want to see it.
You don't want to see it. It's awful.

32:02.875 --> 32:04.458
Go to the last pictures.

32:19.833 --> 32:21.833
[inhales and sighs]

32:28.625 --> 32:29.666
[exhales]

32:33.750 --> 32:36.916
[breathes heavily]

32:40.458 --> 32:42.250
Is that... Is this Garrett?

32:42.333 --> 32:44.250
Is this who you were talking to?

32:45.458 --> 32:46.666
I don't think so.

32:47.791 --> 32:49.791
Those pictures were already on the phone.

32:52.541 --> 32:53.750
[sniffles] Call him.

32:53.833 --> 32:54.833
No.

32:55.500 --> 32:58.166
‐Then I'll call him.
‐That's a bad idea. Don't.

32:58.750 --> 33:04.583
I don't want to think about someone...
dying like this and you'd ignored him.

33:05.583 --> 33:06.791
I ignored him?

33:06.875 --> 33:08.166
He was begging!

33:09.250 --> 33:10.708
That's bullshit.

33:10.791 --> 33:12.583
No one's dead. This is...

33:14.958 --> 33:19.833
It's obviously some fucking nerd
who's into special effects.

33:28.750 --> 33:30.541
[ringing tone]

33:36.833 --> 33:39.416
[ringing tone stops
and indistinct ruffling]

33:43.833 --> 33:44.916
Hello?

33:46.250 --> 33:49.416
[ruffling and heavy breathing]

33:51.333 --> 33:52.333
Garrett?

33:52.416 --> 33:57.125

[Will groans]

34:04.000 --> 34:06.666
[breathes heavily]

34:10.708 --> 34:11.833
No.

34:16.458 --> 34:18.083
I’m going to call the cops.

34:18.916 --> 34:20.208
Don’t.

34:22.500 --> 34:23.750
I said don't!

34:24.208 --> 34:27.666
[breathes heavily]
Will, what are you doing?

34:27.750 --> 34:29.083
[pants softly]

34:39.291 --> 34:43.416
I'll take it to Duane.
He’s a friend. He’ll take it seriously.

34:47.458 --> 34:48.625
Do it right now.

34:52.375 --> 34:54.000
Will, do it right now!

‐[woman] You okay?

35:55.041 --> 35:59.541
[indistinct background chattering]

35:59.625 --> 36:03.125
‐[man 2] Hey! I got your ass on camera!
‐[woman] There's no blood.

36:03.208 --> 36:04.750
[indistinct chattering]

36:04.833 --> 36:06.458
‐Crazy.
‐Look at him.

‐[woman] Hey!
‐[man shouts]

36:11.916 --> 36:14.125

[pants]

36:30.416 --> 36:31.833
Fuck!

36:49.583 --> 36:52.500
There you go. What's up, baby?
How you doin', man?

36:52.583 --> 36:54.791
‐How are you?
‐Good, man. Beautiful day out there.

36:54.875 --> 36:56.875
Yeah, it's hotter than sin.

36:56.958 --> 37:00.791
[laughs] What happened last night?
Why you didn't call us?

37:00.875 --> 37:03.250
I did. It took you guys
an hour and a half to respond.

37:03.333 --> 37:06.375
No, man, I don't mean 5th District.
I mean us.

37:07.166 --> 37:09.166
I didn't know I could do that.

37:09.250 --> 37:12.250
When was the last time Rosie’s
was hit with an underage sting?

37:12.333 --> 37:14.708
When's the last time
there was a noise complaint?

37:14.791 --> 37:17.625
‐That’s our bar. We protect the place.
‐Yeah, I know.

37:17.708 --> 37:19.500
‐What's up, Will?
‐Hey, dude.

37:20.250 --> 37:21.708
‐How are you?
‐Good, man.

37:22.666 --> 37:25.333
‐Eric all right?
‐Yeah. Yeah, he's okay.

37:25.416 --> 37:27.333
‐I checked on him this morning.
‐Have a seat.

37:27.416 --> 37:31.000
So, uh, what about the guy that did this?

37:31.833 --> 37:34.291
I don't know.
I've never seen him before in my life.

37:34.375 --> 37:36.958
Kind of figured
it was something between them.

37:38.166 --> 37:40.750
I tell you what, you see him, you call us.

37:41.625 --> 37:44.583

how tough this bitch really is.

He looked murdered.

‐Yeah.

38:05.250 --> 38:07.500

‐Lost it?
‐Yeah. On the way here.

But I think it was those college kids,
man. I think they took it.

38:15.666 --> 38:18.416
They’ve been following me around
in a black charger.

38:18.500 --> 38:21.500
I know it sounds crazy,
but my girlfriend saw the pictures too.

38:21.583 --> 38:23.416
I'm telling you guys the truth.

38:23.500 --> 38:26.958
So, uh, you got a license plate
on this black charger?

1:00:28.166 --> 1:00:29.083
Jeffrey. Jeffrey.

1:00:29.166 --> 1:00:31.125
‐We got a problem?
‐I thought we were friends.

1:00:31.208 --> 1:00:34.208
We are friends. Why don't you come here
so I can give you a hug?

1:00:34.291 --> 1:00:37.625
‐What's the matter, you fucking prick?
‐Don't talk to him. Talk to me.

1:00:38.666 --> 1:00:40.875
I don't want to talk to you.

1:00:45.291 --> 1:00:47.291
Hey, was that guy crying?

1:00:47.375 --> 1:00:48.833
[laughter]

1:00:48.916 --> 1:00:52.375
Yeah, he was,
'cause he's a little fucking bitch.

1:00:55.708 --> 1:00:57.833
[breathes heavily]

1:01:12.166 --> 1:01:14.000
[breathes heavily]

1:01:14.083 --> 1:01:16.750
[mutters angrily and breathes heavily]

1:01:58.250 --> 1:01:59.833
[Willard] Will.

1:02:00.916 --> 1:02:02.291
Will!

1:02:03.416 --> 1:02:05.416
WILL!

1:02:18.375 --> 1:02:19.458
You want a beer?

1:02:19.541 --> 1:02:23.916
No. Uh... Bourbon, neat.

1:02:37.416 --> 1:02:40.000
I thought you had a stroke or something.

1:03:08.541 --> 1:03:10.000
Damn, shit!

1:03:10.083 --> 1:03:11.416
Watch the bar!

1:03:16.125 --> 1:03:17.708
[tires squeal]

1:03:17.791 --> 1:03:19.416
[engine revs]

1:03:19.500 --> 1:03:22.583
<i>You’ve reached Carrie.</i>
<i>Leave a message and I'll call you back.</i>

1:03:22.666 --> 1:03:24.416
[tires squeal]

1:03:32.125 --> 1:03:33.291
Fuck.

1:03:43.333 --> 1:03:44.708
[breathes heavily]

1:03:46.083 --> 1:03:47.666
Carrie?

1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:50.791
Carrie?

1:03:50.875 --> 1:03:53.083
[breathes heavily]

1:03:53.166 --> 1:03:54.958
Is anyone else in here?

1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:03.041
[breathes heavily]

1:04:07.500 --> 1:04:08.750
Carrie.

1:04:10.041 --> 1:04:13.208
Hey, Carrie. Carrie, are you okay?

1:04:13.291 --> 1:04:14.291
Hey.

1:04:15.583 --> 1:04:19.041
Fuck. Oh, fuck. Jesus Christ.

1:04:21.333 --> 1:04:23.708
Hey, is there anybody else in here?

1:04:25.791 --> 1:04:27.291
Carrie!

1:04:37.958 --> 1:04:39.291
[breathes heavily]

1:04:52.625 --> 1:04:53.666
Fuck!

1:04:54.666 --> 1:04:57.083
[breathes heavily]

1:05:13.708 --> 1:05:14.916
[exhales]

1:05:27.333 --> 1:05:29.375
[phone rings]

1:05:41.291 --> 1:05:44.166
[distorted screams and yells over phone]

1:06:00.875 --> 1:06:03.875
[repressed sobs]

1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:07.000
[sobs softly]

1:06:25.583 --> 1:06:26.666
Whoa.

1:07:12.250 --> 1:07:13.833
[Gasps]

1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:33.458
‐[gasps for breath and coughs]
‐Hey, hey. Are you okay?

1:07:33.541 --> 1:07:35.541
Don't touch me.

1:07:37.375 --> 1:07:39.458
[gasps]

1:07:40.708 --> 1:07:43.666
[breathes heavily]

1:07:52.625 --> 1:07:56.083
[phone rings]

1:08:18.375 --> 1:08:20.416
Shouldn't you be at work?

1:08:21.458 --> 1:08:23.041
Yeah.

1:08:26.666 --> 1:08:28.666
Why did you come home?

1:08:32.208 --> 1:08:34.666
Do you not remember anything that
happened tonight?

1:08:36.708 --> 1:08:40.083
I was looking online for something.
I was doing research.

1:08:41.583 --> 1:08:45.208
And then, uh... I don't know.
It's hard to think.

1:08:45.291 --> 1:08:47.375
Was there anyone else here tonight?

1:08:50.958 --> 1:08:53.125
I think there was.

1:08:57.375 --> 1:09:01.208
‐Oh, my God. I think there was.
‐Who?

1:09:02.208 --> 1:09:04.916
‐I don’t know.
‐You sent me a picture of him.

1:09:11.083 --> 1:09:13.000
No.

1:09:14.666 --> 1:09:17.041
I don’t even remember sending you that.

1:09:23.125 --> 1:09:25.708
[ringing tone]

1:09:27.750 --> 1:09:30.625
‐[Doug] <i>Will.</i>
‐Hey, Doug.

1:09:30.708 --> 1:09:34.750
[Doug] <i>Yo. What the fuck, man?</i>
<i>Look, are you okay?</i>

1:09:34.833 --> 1:09:40.291
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. I'll be in
tomorrow night, if I've still got a job.

1:09:40.375 --> 1:09:44.500
[Doug] <i>Relax. We got you covered.</i>
<i>Just do what you need to do.</i>

1:09:46.541 --> 1:09:47.833
Thanks, man.

1:09:47.916 --> 1:09:51.083
<i>It's no problem at all.</i>
<i>That's what friends are for.</i>

1:09:51.166 --> 1:09:54.041
All right. I appreciate it, man.

1:09:55.041 --> 1:09:58.916
‐All right.
<i>‐Your boy Eric called down here, man.</i>

1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:01.583
Wait, sorry, sorry, what did you say?

1:10:01.666 --> 1:10:05.791
<i>I said Eric called down, asking for you.</i>
<i>Told him you went home early.</i>

1:10:07.166 --> 1:10:08.958
‐What did he want?
<i>‐I don't know.</i>

1:10:09.041 --> 1:10:11.250
<i>He was saying something</i>
<i>about giving you a present.</i>

1:10:11.333 --> 1:10:15.208
<i>I gave him your number, though.</i>
<i>Probably a booty call.</i>

1:10:15.291 --> 1:10:19.125
[laughs] <i>Look, I don't judge, brother,</i>
<i>but I know that's what it is.</i>

1:10:19.208 --> 1:10:20.666
All right, gotcha.

1:11:01.583 --> 1:11:02.625
[sighs]

1:11:10.666 --> 1:11:13.041
[ringing tone]

1:11:13.125 --> 1:11:16.333
[Alicia] <i>Hey, Will.</i>
<i>You shouldn't call here.</i>

1:11:19.333 --> 1:11:21.333
So, you told him, huh?

1:11:21.416 --> 1:11:25.416
<i>Yeah. Yeah, I didn't mean to.</i>

1:11:27.166 --> 1:11:28.500
<i>Maybe I did. I don't know.</i>

1:11:28.583 --> 1:11:31.750
<i>I thought we could go back to normal.</i>
<i>I was stupid.</i>

1:11:34.166 --> 1:11:36.375
Is he there now?

1:11:36.458 --> 1:11:38.083
<i>Yeah. In the other room.</i>

1:11:38.166 --> 1:11:39.791
Are you sure that's a good idea?

1:11:39.875 --> 1:11:41.666
<i>Everything's fine.</i>

1:11:41.750 --> 1:11:45.208
<i>Look, I can't talk to you right now.</i>
<i>I have to go, okay?</i>

1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:48.583
<i>Good night, Will.</i>

1:11:48.666 --> 1:11:50.083
[hangs up]

1:12:00.541 --> 1:12:01.500
What the fuck.

1:12:06.791 --> 1:12:09.000
We really need to do something about that.

1:12:16.125 --> 1:12:20.250
I think we should break up.
I don't think this isn't working.

1:12:26.833 --> 1:12:27.833
Okay.

1:12:30.666 --> 1:12:33.833
That’s all you got, "okay"?

1:12:36.250 --> 1:12:39.625
Why are you acting offended?
You're breaking up with me.

1:12:41.583 --> 1:12:44.166
I can't believe how calmly
you're taking this whole thing.

1:12:48.875 --> 1:12:53.333
I guess you can find a place to crash
while you look for a new apartment, right?

1:12:55.125 --> 1:12:57.500
What, already? Today?

1:13:01.416 --> 1:13:03.541
What did you expect? That we'd cuddle?

1:13:03.625 --> 1:13:05.416
Fuck you!

1:13:06.916 --> 1:13:08.333
I’m sorry. It's just...

1:13:10.625 --> 1:13:14.583
It's just this whole thing with the phone
and the pictures.

1:13:15.541 --> 1:13:19.333
It's dangerous and I don't want you
anywhere around it.

1:13:19.416 --> 1:13:20.916
Really?

1:13:23.333 --> 1:13:24.583
Are you a hero now?

1:13:24.666 --> 1:13:27.958
‐Come on, Carrie.
‐Do you hear yourself?

1:13:30.666 --> 1:13:32.666
You're scared.

1:13:32.750 --> 1:13:38.000
I'm scared, too.
But I would never abandon you to it.

1:13:38.083 --> 1:13:40.666
‐That's not what I’m saying.
‐Fuck you.

1:13:42.541 --> 1:13:45.125
I wasn't mad until just now.

1:13:45.208 --> 1:13:48.458
I was disappointed. I was hurt.

1:13:49.833 --> 1:13:54.708
But now I'm just fucking pissed. So if
that's what you wanted, then you got it.

1:13:55.708 --> 1:13:58.375
That's not what I wanted.

1:13:58.458 --> 1:14:00.666
You know what I think you want?

1:14:03.500 --> 1:14:05.083
Nothing.

1:14:06.083 --> 1:14:08.666
Because there's nothing there to satisfy.

1:14:11.916 --> 1:14:14.041
You are a mock person.

1:14:17.541 --> 1:14:19.916
You're just a body.

1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:22.125
[breathes heavily]

1:14:42.916 --> 1:14:44.708
[Carrie sobs]

1:14:58.500 --> 1:15:00.875
[sobs]

1:15:27.250 --> 1:15:28.583
You okay?

1:15:31.500 --> 1:15:33.625
Fucking Doug say something?

1:15:33.708 --> 1:15:35.291
No.

1:15:37.208 --> 1:15:38.708
Did something happen?

1:15:41.041 --> 1:15:42.041
No.

1:15:44.875 --> 1:15:46.875
Well, you look like shit.

1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:49.500
You even showered today?

1:15:55.166 --> 1:15:57.166
Hit me again.

1:15:57.250 --> 1:16:01.375
I don’t think that’s a good idea.
Your shift starts soon, anyway.

1:16:02.375 --> 1:16:04.458
I’m a grown‐ass man.

1:16:06.791 --> 1:16:08.458
Do I need to worry about you?

1:16:09.708 --> 1:16:12.583
No. You really don’t, Rosie.

1:16:27.666 --> 1:16:30.416
‐Oh!
‐Motherfucker!

1:16:30.500 --> 1:16:32.125
I can buy you another drink, man.

1:16:32.208 --> 1:16:33.625
‐I don’t want your drink!
‐Hey!

1:16:33.708 --> 1:16:35.666
Calm, man.

1:16:42.666 --> 1:16:44.666
What’s gotten into you?

1:16:46.958 --> 1:16:50.416
Go home. Take a shower.
Get your head straight.

1:16:50.500 --> 1:16:52.333
‐What about my shift?
‐Don't worry about it.

1:16:52.416 --> 1:16:54.250
I’ll cover you for tonight.

1:16:54.333 --> 1:16:56.333
I don't want you to.

1:16:56.416 --> 1:16:58.791
I don’t want you to.

1:16:58.875 --> 1:17:02.041
Well, fuck you, Rosie.

1:17:06.458 --> 1:17:08.250
Excuse me?

1:17:08.333 --> 1:17:10.541
Fuck me?

1:17:10.625 --> 1:17:12.625
Fuck you!

1:17:12.708 --> 1:17:14.916
Do you want to keep this job?

1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:16.833
Fuck your job!

1:17:27.083 --> 1:17:29.083
[ringing tone]

1:17:30.083 --> 1:17:32.083
<i>Hey, it's Alicia. Leave a message.</i>

1:17:33.625 --> 1:17:38.125
Alicia, it's me. It’s important.
I need you to call me back.

1:17:39.500 --> 1:17:41.500
I know you're getting these messages.

1:17:43.333 --> 1:17:44.708
Fuck!

1:17:50.333 --> 1:17:52.708
[breathes heavily]

1:18:05.125 --> 1:18:07.500
[flies buzzing]

1:18:31.875 --> 1:18:34.000
[flies buzzing]

1:19:06.166 --> 1:19:07.375
Eric?

1:19:24.208 --> 1:19:25.833
Christ.

1:19:28.625 --> 1:19:29.666
Eric?

1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:38.041
Eric?

1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:44.000
Eric, you in here, man?

1:20:00.250 --> 1:20:01.750
How you living, man?

1:20:08.416 --> 1:20:10.000
Did someone break in here?

1:20:11.166 --> 1:20:12.958
[Eric] What do you want?

1:20:14.625 --> 1:20:16.625
Just checking on you, man.

1:20:18.666 --> 1:20:20.166
I’m fine.

1:20:22.708 --> 1:20:24.833
I got to crash here for a few days.

1:20:28.291 --> 1:20:31.875
I got to stay on your couch
for a day or two.

1:20:35.666 --> 1:20:36.791
No.

1:20:40.541 --> 1:20:44.000
‐I'm up against a wall, man.
‐No!

1:20:50.083 --> 1:20:54.208
I'm gonna clean up around here
a little bit. It'll be good.

1:20:55.791 --> 1:20:57.833
Don't worry about it.

1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:10.000
[ringing tone]

1:21:14.041 --> 1:21:16.041
[sighs]

1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:21.583
[Alicia] <i>I said you shouldn't call here.</i>

1:21:21.666 --> 1:21:25.250
Yeah, that was last night
when you were with Jeffrey.

1:21:25.333 --> 1:21:27.333
Where are you now? You okay?

1:21:27.416 --> 1:21:30.375
<i>Will, I'm trying to fix my life, okay?</i>

1:21:30.458 --> 1:21:33.041
<i>I need you to stop calling me.</i>
<i>It's not helping.</i>

1:21:33.125 --> 1:21:35.791
Wait. I left Carrie.

1:21:37.250 --> 1:21:39.291
I broke up with her this morning.

1:21:39.375 --> 1:21:40.833
[Alicia sighs]

1:21:43.458 --> 1:21:45.666
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1:21:47.791 --> 1:21:52.875
<i>‐I'm sorry to hear that, Will.</i>
‐No, that's a good news, right?

1:21:52.958 --> 1:21:55.416
<i>‐I don't know. That's up to you, I guess.</i>
‐Alicia...

1:21:55.500 --> 1:21:57.875
<i>Will, I'm with Jeffrey.</i>

1:21:57.958 --> 1:22:00.333
<i>I love Jeffrey.</i>
<i>Do you understand that?</i>

1:22:02.041 --> 1:22:05.500
No. No, I don't understand that at all.

1:22:05.583 --> 1:22:10.083
<i>I don't know when we're coming back to</i>
<i>the bar. Maybe not for a while, okay?</i>

1:22:10.166 --> 1:22:12.000
<i>Don't call me back.</i>

1:22:12.083 --> 1:22:15.250
<i>If you really care about me,</i>
<i>you cannot call me back.</i>

1:22:15.333 --> 1:22:16.958
[disconnect tone]

1:23:02.333 --> 1:23:03.916
You can’t be in here.

1:23:07.541 --> 1:23:11.583
You hear me? I don’t want you here.

1:23:14.958 --> 1:23:16.958
Didn’t you call me?

1:23:21.083 --> 1:23:22.708
No.

1:23:25.083 --> 1:23:26.500
[grunts]

1:23:26.583 --> 1:23:30.458
Someone called the bar last night
from this number looking for me.

1:23:31.416 --> 1:23:33.791
If it wasn't you,
then who the fuck was it?

1:23:34.833 --> 1:23:38.166
They made me do it... those freaks.

1:23:40.375 --> 1:23:43.041
Was it the fucking college kids?

1:23:43.125 --> 1:23:44.916
Was it?

1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:48.583
They told me to give you a present.
Now, get the fuck off me!

1:23:49.708 --> 1:23:51.333
I'll kill you.

1:23:52.291 --> 1:23:53.708
I'll kill you.

1:23:53.791 --> 1:23:56.541
[breathes heavily]

1:23:56.625 --> 1:23:59.000

1:24:13.166 --> 1:24:15.000
What's the present, Eric?

1:24:44.041 --> 1:24:45.166
[phone bleeps]

1:25:08.333 --> 1:25:09.750
Are you the wrapping?

1:25:16.791 --> 1:25:17.791
Wait...

1:25:18.458 --> 1:25:20.666
I can feel it moving around in there.

1:25:21.666 --> 1:25:24.250
‐Can't you?
‐Please leave.

1:25:24.333 --> 1:25:26.458
[inhales deeply]

1:25:26.541 --> 1:25:28.500
Most people don't know you.

1:25:28.583 --> 1:25:33.458
They don't see the evil
and the ugly in your heart.

1:25:38.125 --> 1:25:40.500
Do you have to be dead first?

1:25:43.041 --> 1:25:45.625
Or will it rip you open
while you're still alive?

1:25:51.500 --> 1:25:54.083
I wonder what would happen if I called it.

1:25:59.541 --> 1:26:00.791
[grunts]

1:26:16.916 --> 1:26:22.750
[distorted screeching]

1:26:26.041 --> 1:26:29.208
[Eric gasps and groans]

1:26:40.125 --> 1:26:41.750
[yells in pain]

1:26:41.833 --> 1:26:44.750
[gasps and groans]

1:26:47.375 --> 1:26:49.833
[gasps and groans]

1:26:49.916 --> 1:26:52.875
[yells in pain and coughs]

1:26:56.041 --> 1:27:00.916
[yells in pain]

1:27:20.666 --> 1:27:25.250
[Eric] Don't leave me! Goddamn it!
Goddamn it! Goddamn it!

1:27:27.416 --> 1:27:30.583
[yells in pain]

1:27:34.666 --> 1:27:37.625
Please! [yells in pain]

1:27:41.250 --> 1:27:46.333
[yells in pain]

1:27:50.583 --> 1:27:52.916
[gasps and pants]

1:27:53.916 --> 1:27:55.875
Fix me.

1:27:55.958 --> 1:27:57.750
Make me whole.

1:27:57.833 --> 1:27:59.416
[Eric yells in pain]

1:27:59.500 --> 1:28:03.666
[Eric] God, don't take me!
God, don't take me!

1:28:03.750 --> 1:28:06.708
[yells in pain]

1:28:09.916 --> 1:28:12.500
[gasps and groans]

1:28:12.583 --> 1:28:14.958
[yells in pain]
