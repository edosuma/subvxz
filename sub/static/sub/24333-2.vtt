WEBVTT

00:07.086 --> 00:08.508
All my life, people told me

00:08.508 --> 00:10.107
I'd never be good at anything.

00:10.313 --> 00:12.376
I've decided to prove them wrong.

00:12.697 --> 00:14.697
Unfortunately, you don't get credit

00:14.699 --> 00:17.200
for being good at selling
crack or convincing women

00:17.202 --> 00:20.237
that making love to them with
your socks on still counts.

00:21.128 --> 00:23.395
So when I got locked up, I made up my mind

00:23.397 --> 00:25.597
that I was gonna be
good at something legit.

00:26.233 --> 00:29.195
I discovered I had mad culinary skill.

00:31.372 --> 00:34.271
Now it's time for me to
share my gift with the world.

00:35.809 --> 00:38.423
Behold, the dessert loaf...

00:38.879 --> 00:41.787
The shining star of my prison cuisine.

00:47.198 --> 00:48.831
Okay, so what I was thinking

00:48.833 --> 00:51.133
was a South American theme.

00:51.135 --> 00:52.330
Hold on a second.

00:53.104 --> 00:54.503
Oh, my God.

00:55.777 --> 00:56.809
Oh, really?

00:56.834 --> 00:58.753
Shay Shay, why you not taking my calls?

00:58.753 --> 01:00.887
Tray, um, now is not a good time.

01:01.076 --> 01:02.721
I got me this smart phone.

01:02.721 --> 01:04.921
This Russian dude jail-broke it for me.

01:04.923 --> 01:06.122
Well, that's nice, but I'm...

01:06.124 --> 01:07.891
Got games, a camera,

01:07.893 --> 01:09.526
even a fitness app that count all my steps.

01:10.511 --> 01:12.996
I feel like "The Six Million
Dollar Man" up in this mug.

01:12.998 --> 01:14.931
But I spent all my money
on this smart phone.

01:14.933 --> 01:16.933
Now I feel like the $1.50 kid.

01:18.003 --> 01:20.570
Well, Tray, I'm in the
middle of a meeting, okay?

01:20.572 --> 01:22.739
Damn! That's your office?!

01:22.741 --> 01:23.773
Nice!

01:24.070 --> 01:25.375
Why don't you introduce me

01:25.376 --> 01:26.976
to some of your colleagues and whatnot?

01:27.417 --> 01:29.305
Uh, sorry, I have to
take this really quick.

01:29.307 --> 01:30.440
I'm gonna step out.

01:30.442 --> 01:31.908
Just work amongst yourselves, all right?

01:31.910 --> 01:33.176
Yo, Shay. Just work amongst yourselves?

01:33.178 --> 01:34.343
Where'd you go?

01:34.345 --> 01:36.596
The screen just went
black! Man, I can't see you!

01:36.596 --> 01:37.650
What do you want?

01:37.764 --> 01:38.863
I'm just saying hello.

01:38.865 --> 01:40.106
Tray, stop calling me.

01:40.131 --> 01:41.699
When can I meet the kids, Shay?

01:41.701 --> 01:44.084
You want to see the kids? <i>My</i> kids?

01:44.085 --> 01:45.151
<i>Our</i> kids.

01:45.153 --> 01:46.218
Oh, I don't know.

01:46.220 --> 01:47.720
How about when you get a job

01:47.722 --> 01:49.534
or volunteer at a community center?

01:49.559 --> 01:50.623
Something.

01:50.625 --> 01:53.053
In other words, make something of yourself.

01:53.361 --> 01:55.060
All the adults in my kids' lives

01:55.062 --> 01:56.061
are positive role models,

01:56.063 --> 01:58.134
and I very much want to keep it that way.

01:58.159 --> 01:59.598
So it would probably be a waste of time

01:59.600 --> 02:01.567
to ask you to show your
booty on camera, huh?

02:01.569 --> 02:03.302
- Boy...
- Shay, wait a minute.

02:03.304 --> 02:04.532
Get off my phone!

02:05.873 --> 02:08.419
I'm sorry, can you run that
by me one more time, because, uh...?

02:08.443 --> 02:12.070
I said I would like to become
head chef at D.B. Delgotti's.

02:12.357 --> 02:14.277
It's pronounced D.B. Delguadio's,

02:14.302 --> 02:15.635
and we already have a head chef.

02:15.637 --> 02:17.103
His name is D.B. Delguadio.

02:17.105 --> 02:18.522
He's one of the top chefs in the city.

02:18.522 --> 02:20.856
Well, why don't y'all build
another D.B. Delgottio's,

02:20.858 --> 02:22.297
make me head chef,

02:22.744 --> 02:24.057
and it'd be a prison theme?

02:24.646 --> 02:26.679
Interesting idea, but I don't think

02:26.681 --> 02:28.754
it's something Mr. Delguadio
would want to pursue.

02:28.972 --> 02:30.948
Okay. Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

02:30.973 --> 02:33.206
I see I got to make you
a believer, young man.

02:33.392 --> 02:34.658
Are you ready?

02:34.683 --> 02:35.749
I d... I don't know.

02:35.751 --> 02:36.984
Let me know. Are you ready?

02:36.986 --> 02:38.425
- I...
- Are you ready?

02:38.450 --> 02:39.548
- I don't...
- You ready?

02:39.548 --> 02:40.713
- I don't think s...
- Are you ready?

02:40.715 --> 02:42.348
- Uh, sure.
- Coming at ya.

02:42.350 --> 02:43.516
- Okay.
- Coming quick.

02:43.518 --> 02:44.933
- Okay.
- Blauw!

02:47.102 --> 02:48.122
Yeah?

02:48.123 --> 02:49.255
What is... What is that?

02:49.257 --> 02:50.356
It's called a dessert loaf.

02:50.608 --> 02:51.680
You should try it.

02:51.680 --> 02:53.389
Got a little piece
waiting right here for you.

02:53.414 --> 02:54.980
I really don't want to try anything.

02:54.982 --> 02:56.215
- Give me your hand.
- Oh, okay.

02:56.217 --> 02:58.138
Turn it around. Put that in there.

02:58.138 --> 02:59.265
- Oh.
- Taste it.

03:01.142 --> 03:02.844
Mm-hmm?

03:03.976 --> 03:05.910
See, the crunchiness that you tasting,

03:05.912 --> 03:07.645
that's coming from the Chex Mix.

03:07.647 --> 03:09.902
The sweetness comes from Reese's Pieces.

03:10.116 --> 03:12.583
And that aroma that's going up
in that pretty, little nose...

03:12.585 --> 03:14.518
That's a pretty, little nose you got...

03:14.520 --> 03:16.554
That's from a splash of pruno.

03:16.798 --> 03:17.888
Wow.

03:17.890 --> 03:19.357
You ain't never tasted nothing like that.

03:19.359 --> 03:20.524
No, uh, never.

03:20.526 --> 03:21.831
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

03:21.831 --> 03:23.675
What I make tastes good.

03:23.735 --> 03:26.106
That's why you should hire me as head chef.

03:26.511 --> 03:27.537
Okay?

03:27.539 --> 03:29.667
Here. I could turn this place around.

03:29.668 --> 03:31.091
We don't need a head chef,

03:31.091 --> 03:32.690
and our restaurant does
not need turning around.

03:32.692 --> 03:34.092
- We're doing just fine.
- Pastry chef.

03:34.094 --> 03:35.960
- We don't need a pastry chef.
- Line cook.

03:35.962 --> 03:37.295
We have a full kitchen.

03:37.297 --> 03:38.604
I could take garbage out.

03:38.629 --> 03:40.365
We have a full garbage staff.

03:40.367 --> 03:42.066
I'll put a dress on, be a waitress.

03:42.068 --> 03:43.765
Yeah, I... and I really
appreciate that, but...

03:43.765 --> 03:46.271
I don't mind. How about
the lowest position here...

03:46.273 --> 03:47.772
Assistant manager?

03:49.211 --> 03:51.676
I'm the assistant manager. So...

03:53.336 --> 03:54.509
You are?

03:55.205 --> 03:57.580
Well, in that case, I'd like
to file a complaint, man.

03:58.911 --> 04:01.000
I've been treated very rudely here today.

04:02.181 --> 04:04.248
Very rudely.

04:06.418 --> 04:08.885
Ah, man.

04:08.887 --> 04:10.821
Big Country. Why they
call you that, anyway?

04:11.252 --> 04:13.152
Was fat cracker already taken?

04:14.267 --> 04:16.367
Kaboom! I'm on fire today, boy.

04:16.369 --> 04:18.332
You just mad, 'cause I'm a
better card player than you.

04:19.315 --> 04:20.353
What?

04:20.353 --> 04:21.552
Fool, you crazy.

04:21.755 --> 04:22.887
I'm a card sharp.

04:22.889 --> 04:24.022
You hear him?

04:24.024 --> 04:25.603
He just called himself a card shark.

04:25.892 --> 04:27.659
Card <i>sharp</i> with a "p."

04:28.121 --> 04:29.427
Boy, y'all just a bunch

04:29.429 --> 04:31.029
of ignorant convicts, I swear, man.

04:31.031 --> 04:32.864
I got to dumb it down
just to talk to y'all.

04:32.866 --> 04:34.966
Like talking to a bunch of fifth graders.

04:34.968 --> 04:37.168
I may be dumb, but I'm still
gonna take all your money.

04:37.170 --> 04:39.337
No, no, no. This just pretend right here.

04:39.339 --> 04:40.905
We all had a $10 buy-in.

04:40.907 --> 04:43.667
When we done, we all getting $10 back.

04:43.777 --> 04:45.243
That's some bullshit.

04:45.245 --> 04:46.340
Yeah.

04:46.713 --> 04:48.112
Great.

04:48.114 --> 04:49.747
So how much we playing for?

04:56.022 --> 04:58.022
Nice threads, Tray.

04:58.024 --> 04:59.727
Nigga, that suit is wearing you.

04:59.759 --> 05:01.192
That suit need a hem in it.

05:01.194 --> 05:03.661
- A hem.
- Are those shoulder pads?

05:05.565 --> 05:07.599
Yuk, yuk, yuk. Laugh it up, man.

05:07.601 --> 05:09.133
I'm trying to improve my life

05:09.135 --> 05:11.490
while y'all sitting on
your asses playing cards.

05:11.905 --> 05:14.058
Okay? I got ambitions in this world.

05:14.058 --> 05:15.557
I'm gonna find me a job.

05:15.559 --> 05:18.427
That's good. I see you
are following my orders.

05:18.429 --> 05:19.511
Very good.

05:19.511 --> 05:21.761
Everybody in my house gots to get a job.

05:21.786 --> 05:23.552
I'm doing this on my own accords, Mullins.

05:23.554 --> 05:25.615
It ain't got nothing to do with you.

05:25.640 --> 05:28.440
No, you following my orders.
That's what you doing.

05:28.442 --> 05:29.506
Where you looking?

05:29.506 --> 05:30.528
Restaurants.

05:31.107 --> 05:33.007
You know burger flippers don't
have to wear no monkey suit.

05:33.009 --> 05:34.041
You know that, right?

05:34.043 --> 05:35.560
High-end restaurants.

05:35.812 --> 05:37.759
All y'all know my skills in the kitchen.

05:38.147 --> 05:40.592
I'm gonna be a chef. Gourmet chef.

05:40.592 --> 05:42.892
That's great, Barker.

05:43.278 --> 05:44.448
That's great. You know what?

05:44.449 --> 05:46.649
Would you mind bringing me
an order of fries with that?

05:51.295 --> 05:52.993
With some aioli dipping sauce.

05:53.124 --> 05:54.490
Make 'em truffle fries.

05:54.647 --> 05:56.646
And a fava bean pesto.

05:57.547 --> 05:59.071
Hey, Tray, if you going for real,

05:59.071 --> 06:01.112
can you bring some fries back, though?

06:07.580 --> 06:09.046
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

06:09.048 --> 06:12.516
We don't employ anybody
with a criminal record.

06:14.820 --> 06:16.353
Last felon I hired

06:16.355 --> 06:18.855
stole four boxes of frozen
meat out of the walk-in.

06:19.122 --> 06:21.358
Never again. Take a hike, pal.

06:22.795 --> 06:25.295
Ex-con? Yo, get the out of here.

06:25.297 --> 06:27.297
You kidding me?

06:31.706 --> 06:32.849
Hell, no!

06:39.388 --> 06:41.021
Hi. Welcome to Grundle's.

06:41.023 --> 06:42.822
What can I get started for you today?

06:42.824 --> 06:44.924
I just need the key to use the men's room.

06:44.926 --> 06:47.861
Um, the bathrooms are
for paying customers only,

06:47.863 --> 06:49.362
so unless you're gonna buy something,

06:49.364 --> 06:52.373
please step aside for the
next paying customer in line.

06:52.373 --> 06:53.739
What kind of policy is that?

06:53.741 --> 06:55.575
Uh, that's a standard policy.

06:59.469 --> 07:00.787
Don't grab that.

07:02.417 --> 07:04.217
Don't you... Sir!

07:04.219 --> 07:06.219
No! Please, no!

07:07.956 --> 07:09.692
Restrooms are for paying customers only!

07:15.430 --> 07:17.029
Yo, my man,

07:17.031 --> 07:19.031
you need to come on out of here. Y...

07:21.436 --> 07:24.337
- What's up, Wavy?
- Dinner's ready.

07:24.339 --> 07:25.838
Five girls, five boys.

07:27.008 --> 07:28.541
Man, come on!

07:28.543 --> 07:30.209
Put your hands up!

07:31.279 --> 07:32.845
You have the right to remain silent.

07:32.847 --> 07:34.514
- Anything you say...
- What do we got here?

07:38.738 --> 07:39.886
Wavy?

07:40.224 --> 07:42.824
Yo, coffee is my new hustle, son.

07:43.126 --> 07:45.460
Yeah, I got in this shit early
right after you went away.

07:45.462 --> 07:47.482
You mean, after I got
knocked and you didn't?

07:48.210 --> 07:50.699
Don't think I ever forgot
that you never snitched.

07:51.434 --> 07:55.403
No, your... your getting
busted, that was my wake-up call.

07:55.405 --> 07:58.507
I'm glad my incarceration was
a teachable moment for you.

07:58.509 --> 08:01.877
Meanwhile, I'm a felon,
unemployed like a mother[BLEEP]

08:01.879 --> 08:04.469
Mm, I hate to see you like this, too, man.

08:05.015 --> 08:07.649
Ill-fitting suit, dirty as [BLEEP]

08:08.362 --> 08:09.471
Nah.

08:10.903 --> 08:12.852
I think it's time we paid you back.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.556
Payback?

08:14.558 --> 08:16.791
Yo, this coffee game is more lucrative

08:16.793 --> 08:18.402
than slinging ever was.

08:18.662 --> 08:21.163
Coffee beans dirt-cheap from Colombia.

08:21.163 --> 08:23.731
All we do is sprinkle some
hot water in them shits

08:23.734 --> 08:25.834
and sell 'em for like $4, $5 a pop.

08:25.836 --> 08:28.269
That's good money. $5 for coffee?

08:28.271 --> 08:30.105
Yo, these white folks got jobs.

08:30.491 --> 08:32.006
And their kids come in here, too.

08:32.916 --> 08:34.849
Beats looking over your shoulder for cops.

08:34.851 --> 08:36.551
- Yeah.
- I know that.

08:36.553 --> 08:38.701
You ain't got to look over
your shoulder for no damn cops.

08:38.889 --> 08:41.322
But you do have to look out for corporate

08:41.323 --> 08:43.224
trying to bust mother[BLEEP]
for not upholding

08:43.251 --> 08:44.547
the standards of the brand.

08:44.572 --> 08:46.982
That's why I got Elizabeth.
That's my lookout.

08:49.516 --> 08:51.316
Little girl with the glasses?

08:51.697 --> 08:53.731
Look like Velma from "Scooby-Doo"?

08:54.052 --> 08:56.138
That woman is not to be [BLEEP] with.

08:57.622 --> 08:59.749
Yo, she scare the [BLEEP] out of me.

09:00.391 --> 09:02.692
It's like... it's like
she could see through me

09:02.694 --> 09:05.982
with those cold, little shark eyes.

09:08.334 --> 09:09.333
So, what that mean?

09:09.335 --> 09:10.968
That mean we gonna be like...

09:11.188 --> 09:13.184
Like, we gonna be partners?

09:14.180 --> 09:15.257
Partners?

09:15.259 --> 09:17.600
So how about
we start with some baby steps

09:17.600 --> 09:20.170
and you inspect this condiment bar?

09:20.330 --> 09:21.598
How does that look to you?

09:21.799 --> 09:24.022
Lot of shit on there,
man. It need to be cleaned.

09:24.022 --> 09:26.689
Good, Tray. Wipe it down, then.

09:27.007 --> 09:28.958
Okay. Hey, J-Boogie?

09:28.960 --> 09:30.093
Could you throw me a rag?

09:30.095 --> 09:31.561
No, no, no. No, no, no, no.

09:31.563 --> 09:33.930
We don't use the term
"rag" here at Grundle's.

09:33.932 --> 09:35.198
We say "cloth."

09:35.200 --> 09:37.333
Once you read that manual that we gave you,

09:37.335 --> 09:40.036
you're gonna be more
caught up on the lexicon.

09:40.038 --> 09:42.472
Cool. J-Boogie, could you toss me a cloth?

09:42.474 --> 09:44.607
No, no, no. No. Oh, my goodness.

09:44.609 --> 09:46.342
- No tossing. Mnh-mnh.
- That's what you said.

09:46.344 --> 09:49.012
We don't want anyone to get
scalded with hot coffee or tea.

09:49.014 --> 09:50.647
- That'd be bad, right?
- You right.

09:50.649 --> 09:53.016
You don't want to melt nobody
[BLEEP] face off, you know.

09:53.018 --> 09:54.451
That's exactly what we're gonna avoid.

09:54.453 --> 09:55.985
Remind of that movie "Hannibal Lecter."

09:55.987 --> 09:57.086
You ever seen "Hannibal"?

09:57.088 --> 09:58.588
No, I haven't seen it.

09:58.590 --> 10:00.056
Yeah, he had this melty-faced
dude in there, man.

10:00.058 --> 10:01.424
He's all [BLEEP] up in a wheelchair.

10:01.426 --> 10:02.992
- I don't like that.
- Burn victim.

10:02.994 --> 10:04.694
I don't watch movies
with wheelchairs or burns.

10:04.696 --> 10:07.430
Ray Liotta eats his
own brain in that movie.

10:07.432 --> 10:09.065
No, I mean, it sounds great.

10:09.067 --> 10:10.633
It's the sequel to "Silence of the Lambs."

10:10.635 --> 10:12.402
You don't remember "Silence of the Lambs,"

10:12.404 --> 10:13.736
when he was singing that song?

10:13.738 --> 10:14.838
With his thing between...

10:14.840 --> 10:16.007
His pecker between his legs?

10:16.032 --> 10:17.874
Uh-huh.

10:17.876 --> 10:19.375
I'm not gonna see that,
and we need to focus

10:19.377 --> 10:20.844
- on what we're doing.
- Okay.

10:20.846 --> 10:22.011
- Let's get focused.
- Okay.

10:22.013 --> 10:23.179
Okay, see that couple right there?

10:23.181 --> 10:24.347
They're leaving,

10:24.347 --> 10:27.982
so we want to get to their
table within 30 seconds,

10:28.375 --> 10:31.410
so you can wipe it down
and make the next customer

10:31.412 --> 10:33.972
have a more satisfying
Grundle's experience.

10:34.245 --> 10:36.746
Hi, ma'am. This is team member Tray.

10:36.748 --> 10:38.147
He's gonna wipe down this table for you

10:38.149 --> 10:39.448
and make sure it's clean.

10:39.450 --> 10:41.650
Oh, great. Thanks.

10:41.675 --> 10:44.365
Clean table for the lady with the latte.

10:44.789 --> 10:46.222
And the pretty body.

10:46.224 --> 10:47.490
- Oh.
- You know what?

10:47.492 --> 10:49.525
I'm gonna call Animal Control on you.

10:49.527 --> 10:50.860
- Why?
- 'Cause you a cougar.

10:50.862 --> 10:52.962
- You on the loose. Rrrrahh.
- Ooh!

10:52.964 --> 10:54.363
I'm scared of you.

10:54.365 --> 10:55.598
I swear to God, I'm scared of you.

10:55.600 --> 10:56.999
I'm ready to do something strange

10:57.001 --> 10:58.200
for a little bit of change.

10:58.202 --> 10:59.468
- Here you go.
- You'd better know that.

10:59.470 --> 11:00.703
No, no, no, no, no, no.

11:00.705 --> 11:02.138
I would love to talk to you right now.

11:02.140 --> 11:04.240
She gave me some money.

11:05.777 --> 11:07.376
Hey, I love that you're establishing

11:07.378 --> 11:08.844
- a "rapport" with the customers.
- Mm-hmm.

11:08.846 --> 11:10.513
I think that's real cool.

11:10.515 --> 11:11.681
But, uh, I'm gonna need you

11:11.683 --> 11:13.516
to stay away from suggestive language

11:13.518 --> 11:15.317
so that we don't get sued for harassment.

11:15.319 --> 11:17.286
Damn, What you mean, sued?

11:17.288 --> 11:19.727
She don't want to sue me. She tryna do me.

11:20.143 --> 11:21.908
She probably don't even
want me to use a rubber.

11:22.422 --> 11:23.698
Oh, my God.

11:24.362 --> 11:25.594
What, I'm just...

11:27.868 --> 11:29.868
Good? How's the bruschetta?

11:30.220 --> 11:32.722
Mm. Oh. Too much garlic.

11:32.990 --> 11:34.591
Huh. I don't think so.

11:37.248 --> 11:39.702
Uh, you're insane. This is perfect.

11:39.702 --> 11:40.902
- Good. Enjoy.
- I will.

11:40.903 --> 11:42.235
Just don't try to kiss me later.

11:42.237 --> 11:43.470
You don't try to kiss <i>me.</i>

11:43.472 --> 11:44.805
No, you don't try to kiss <i>me.</i>

11:44.807 --> 11:46.339
Try it right now.

11:46.341 --> 11:48.041
- Try not to kiss me right now.
- No. No. No. No.

11:48.043 --> 11:49.146
It's impossible.

11:51.036 --> 11:52.468
You-know-who is trying
to call me again.

11:52.471 --> 11:53.704
Well, just answer it.

11:53.706 --> 11:55.039
No, I don't feel like dealing with him.

11:55.041 --> 11:56.373
Who's
you-know-who?

11:56.375 --> 11:58.042
Mind your business and finish your food.

11:59.721 --> 12:01.087
Oh, what number is this? Huh?

12:01.089 --> 12:02.989
Don't answer it. Don't.

12:03.374 --> 12:04.581
Yo, Josh.

12:04.776 --> 12:06.675
I'm trying to reach
Shay. She there with you?

12:06.677 --> 12:08.277
How'd you get my cell number?

12:08.279 --> 12:09.645
Oh, it's on your Linkedln page.

12:09.647 --> 12:11.380
I also found out you was
in an a cappella group

12:11.382 --> 12:12.648
called Pitch Slapped.

12:12.650 --> 12:14.083
You looked at my Linkedln?

12:14.085 --> 12:16.671
Yo, Josh, let's stop
with the jibba-jabba, man.

12:16.671 --> 12:18.004
Put Shay on the phone.

12:18.007 --> 12:19.181
You called me.

12:19.275 --> 12:21.608
I mean, you called me, so, how...

12:22.632 --> 12:23.615
What?

12:23.640 --> 12:26.013
Yo, what up? How you living, young people?!

12:26.373 --> 12:28.687
You moved the camera. I
can't see the kids no more.

12:28.888 --> 12:30.654
Tray, you are stalking me now.

12:30.679 --> 12:31.718
I just called to tell you

12:31.720 --> 12:33.587
I took your advice, and I got a job.

12:34.070 --> 12:36.004
I'm over at Grundle's Coffee Shop, man.

12:36.004 --> 12:37.037
I'm a barista.

12:37.037 --> 12:39.070
Good. Good. I'm happy for you.

12:39.072 --> 12:40.772
You think I could meet the kids now?

12:40.774 --> 12:42.065
Who's that on the phone?

12:42.509 --> 12:44.776
This is all moving way too fast, Tray.

12:44.778 --> 12:46.084
Well, I'm a fast mover.

12:46.134 --> 12:47.712
You know, I came into some good luck.

12:47.712 --> 12:50.179
Wavy owns the coffee
shop, and he hooked me up.

12:50.561 --> 12:52.214
Wavy?

12:52.216 --> 12:54.450
You mean, Wavy-Wavy?

12:54.452 --> 12:56.318
He went legit. Wears a suit and everything.

12:56.320 --> 12:57.953
No lime green nowhere.

12:57.955 --> 13:00.256
The fool who let you rot in
jail for holding his stuff?

13:01.477 --> 13:03.158
Why you doing your mad laugh, Shay?

13:03.160 --> 13:05.249
No reason. No reason at all.

13:05.363 --> 13:07.263
You just back working with Wavy.

13:07.265 --> 13:09.045
So, can I see the kids or what?

13:09.133 --> 13:10.699
I think we should wait a little bit on that

13:10.701 --> 13:12.568
just to see if this nigga ruins your life

13:12.570 --> 13:14.136
and you end up back in jail again.

13:14.138 --> 13:16.859
Mmkay? All right, great. Bye-bye.

13:17.326 --> 13:18.792
Did you just say "nigga"?

13:18.922 --> 13:20.406
Did <i>you</i> just say "nigga"?

13:22.813 --> 13:24.912
Yeah, all right, stay
mad at me, then, Kisha!

13:24.937 --> 13:27.038
Yo! Yo, you ain't do it!

13:27.040 --> 13:29.006
- Done, done. It's done.
- You ain't do it. You got a job?

13:29.008 --> 13:31.309
- It's done!
- Aah! Tray got the job!

13:31.311 --> 13:33.010
I see you, boy!

13:33.012 --> 13:35.146
- I knew I didn't look up to no fool, man.
- Park up, park up.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.205
Let me tell you all about it, man.

13:36.230 --> 13:37.244
I'ma relax, man. Tell me what happened.

13:37.269 --> 13:39.769
It wasn't no puzzle I was
gonna get my life back on track.

13:39.794 --> 13:40.802
Well, come on, man.

13:40.802 --> 13:42.168
You talking to the kid right now.

13:42.170 --> 13:43.920
Look, I know, I know, but I got to admit,

13:44.138 --> 13:45.938
when you told me you was looking for a job,

13:45.940 --> 13:48.174
I was like "I don't know, man.

13:48.176 --> 13:51.077
You got to check that box, and
don't nobody want no felon."

13:51.079 --> 13:52.578
I knew you was worried.

13:52.580 --> 13:53.704
I seen it in your eyes.

13:53.729 --> 13:56.296
But see, that's why you don't snitch.

13:56.551 --> 13:57.700
You understand?

13:57.700 --> 14:00.100
Yo, no matter what go down,
in the name of loyalty,

14:00.102 --> 14:03.136
when it's all said and done,
ain't no more else to say or do,

14:03.138 --> 14:05.072
loyalty what pays off.

14:05.292 --> 14:06.706
Yeah. Yeah, that's dope.

14:06.958 --> 14:09.391
I mean, you had to give
up 15 years of your life,

14:09.394 --> 14:11.465
but now, you a barista.

14:11.662 --> 14:13.550
Man, that's dope.

14:13.631 --> 14:15.497
Man, it's just the beginning for me, man.

14:15.499 --> 14:17.099
- Sky's the limit.
- Okay.

14:17.101 --> 14:19.902
Yeah, sure, I'm selling
overpriced coffee now at Grundle's.

14:19.904 --> 14:21.570
- That's for now.
- Yeah. Yeah.

14:21.572 --> 14:22.883
But soon, watch.

14:23.107 --> 14:26.856
Head pastry designer at
Grundle's Franchise Coffee.

14:26.881 --> 14:28.018
Word. Talk to me, son.

14:28.044 --> 14:29.846
And then that's when I'm gonna tell them...

14:29.847 --> 14:31.380
- Yeah.
- ..."Yo, make me a partner...

14:31.382 --> 14:33.382
- Yeah.
- ...or I'm out like a light, I'm gone."

14:33.384 --> 14:35.351
That's what I'm talking about.
Get down and lay down, B.

14:35.353 --> 14:36.619
He better know that.

14:36.621 --> 14:38.020
You know what? I knew you had a plan.

14:38.022 --> 14:39.622
What, you think this is amateur hour?

14:39.624 --> 14:41.256
Hey, at first, I was buggin'.

14:41.258 --> 14:43.459
I was buggin', 'cause
I'm like, yo, I'm petty.

14:43.461 --> 14:45.260
- You know I'm petty.
- I know, I know.

14:45.262 --> 14:47.108
See, 'cause I'd be pissed!

14:47.109 --> 14:48.508
Oh, man, Wavy gave me

14:48.510 --> 14:52.345
some low-level, bullshit GED dropout,

14:52.347 --> 14:54.748
below-the-poverty-line
job that you got?

14:54.750 --> 14:56.616
Man, but I... but I see

14:56.618 --> 14:58.118
you got it all figured out, cuzo.

14:58.120 --> 15:01.868
Bobby, there's a such thing
as being too supportive, man.

15:01.892 --> 15:02.924
Think.

15:02.949 --> 15:04.349
My apologizes.

15:06.277 --> 15:08.287
I'm still good for a latte though, right?

15:09.765 --> 15:11.498
Cappuccino, Frappuccino.

15:11.500 --> 15:13.233
Look at you begging already, man.

15:13.235 --> 15:14.601
A'ight, a'ight, a'ight.

15:14.603 --> 15:15.836
You know I earned mines,
you know what I mean?

15:15.838 --> 15:17.170
Kevin!

15:17.492 --> 15:18.691
- What up?
- That's Kevin.

15:18.693 --> 15:19.959
- Hey, yo, Kev! Kev!
- What up?!

15:20.023 --> 15:22.390
Cuzo got the job! Cuzo got the job!

15:22.416 --> 15:24.783
Ooh, you see him?!

15:26.000 --> 15:32.074

15:35.661 --> 15:36.895
Thank you, Cheryl.

15:36.897 --> 15:38.597
Now, you just take your
fine ass over there.

15:38.599 --> 15:42.067
Team member Jason will get
started on your ice blended.

15:42.069 --> 15:44.570
- Thanks.
- Mmm. Next!

15:44.572 --> 15:47.260
Oh, Liam Neeson face. Get over here, Kevin.

15:47.950 --> 15:50.409
I know you have a particular set of skills,

15:50.411 --> 15:52.077
especially with the ladies.

15:53.614 --> 15:55.013
Boom! Your black coffee's

15:55.015 --> 15:56.515
- over there ready for you.
- All right.

15:56.517 --> 15:59.918
All right, Steve and
Lisa, my hot latte couple.

15:59.920 --> 16:02.554
<i> Ooh, Steve and Lisa sitting in the tree </i>

16:02.556 --> 16:04.456
<i>K-I-S-S-I-N-G </i>

16:04.458 --> 16:06.792
Unless I lay my hands on her
first and get her pregnant.

16:06.794 --> 16:08.861
Hey, you know I'm old school.
I don't be pulling out.

16:09.784 --> 16:11.808
You didn't know that?

16:11.966 --> 16:13.332
Go on, girl.

16:13.334 --> 16:14.766
The Big, Bad Wolf is out there.

16:14.768 --> 16:17.269
I'll huff and puff and
blow her vajayjay down.

16:17.271 --> 16:18.904
Who's next?!

16:18.906 --> 16:21.573
Excuse me? Tray? Hey, excuse me.

16:21.575 --> 16:23.909
Um, I know that you are doing your best,

16:24.194 --> 16:26.411
but if there's another infraction today,

16:26.413 --> 16:27.779
I'm gonna have to write you up.

16:27.923 --> 16:30.415
Easy, mama. I'm just doing my thing here.

16:30.417 --> 16:32.472
Okay. Don't do your thing!

16:32.720 --> 16:33.919
Okay, I want you to do <i>my</i> thing

16:33.921 --> 16:35.621
'cause I'm the boss, and I say what goes!

16:35.623 --> 16:37.039
You do what I say!

16:39.457 --> 16:41.426
I'm gonna... I'm gonna take over
the register for a little bit.

16:44.632 --> 16:46.465
Who's next?

16:51.573 --> 16:53.168
Can't fool me, Goth Girl.

16:54.229 --> 16:55.374
SS alert.

16:55.792 --> 16:56.799
What?

16:56.799 --> 16:58.252
- Secret shopper.
- Where?

16:58.277 --> 17:00.667

17:45.056 --> 17:48.825

secret shopper, my nigga.

17:48.827 --> 17:51.105
I had her eating out of my
hands like Bubbles the monkey.

17:51.221 --> 17:52.558

18:00.975 --> 18:02.942
But, you know, you

18:02.944 --> 18:04.677
Secret shopper gave you five stars.

18:04.679 --> 18:05.727
But...

18:09.345 --> 18:12.122
...we got a snitch in the midst.

18:13.154 --> 18:16.995
Somehow corporate found out...

18:18.697 --> 18:21.131
about a little con that I've been running.

18:21.813 --> 18:24.601
Wavy, you told me this place was legit.

18:24.953 --> 18:26.753
And I told you I had to keep my nose clean

18:26.778 --> 18:27.926
or I was going back.

18:27.926 --> 18:29.825
- I'm not going back, man.
- Easy, easy, Tray.

18:29.827 --> 18:31.994
Easy, Tray. This ain't about the police.

18:32.707 --> 18:35.267
This is coffee. It ain't drugs.

18:35.433 --> 18:37.133
All right? Look, look.

18:37.135 --> 18:40.136
I just been, you know,
taking the fair trade beans,

18:40.138 --> 18:43.247
and I'm cutting them with
a little generic bobo brand.

18:43.825 --> 18:45.018
Damn.

18:45.577 --> 18:46.844
Now you in trouble.

18:48.028 --> 18:49.303
Maybe.

18:50.354 --> 18:51.548
Maybe not.

18:52.420 --> 18:53.475
It depends.

18:53.500 --> 18:54.612
Depends on what?

18:59.863 --> 19:01.136
On whether or not...

19:02.265 --> 19:04.849
you want to take a hit
for your man Wavy again.

19:05.770 --> 19:08.395
Come on, all you got to do
is say that, "I didn't know."

19:08.907 --> 19:10.268
Look, I promise you,

19:10.642 --> 19:12.678
I will take care of you down the road.

19:13.111 --> 19:14.310
I don't know about this.

19:14.310 --> 19:16.033
Yo, just do your man a solid.

19:16.444 --> 19:18.018
I'ma make it worth your while.

19:18.492 --> 19:20.988
15 years ago, I might
have took the rap for you,

19:21.796 --> 19:22.973
but not now.

19:23.194 --> 19:24.599
Got kids now.

19:25.066 --> 19:27.328
Just trying to be the type
of dude they're proud of.

19:28.155 --> 19:30.993
I'm not gonna sit here
and act like I'm a part

19:30.993 --> 19:32.819
of some shit I ain't
have nothing to do with.

19:33.054 --> 19:34.120
None.

19:34.122 --> 19:35.851
Now, I hope you understand.

19:36.725 --> 19:39.846
But if you don't, it's okay.

19:43.832 --> 19:45.203
Look out!

19:45.228 --> 19:46.332
Yo, I'm just [BLEEP]

19:46.334 --> 19:48.267
I tested you, you... Come here, man.

19:48.269 --> 19:51.437
You passed the [BLEEP] test.
That's what I'm talking about!

19:51.439 --> 19:52.567
Crazy.

19:52.741 --> 19:54.065
I love you, man!

19:55.777 --> 19:57.290
See, I can trust you now.

19:59.113 --> 20:00.190
Ah!

20:00.215 --> 20:01.804
So, if that's it,

20:02.743 --> 20:04.258
I'ma hit the floor, man.

20:04.686 --> 20:07.891
You know, make sure everybody
got enough chey powder.

20:08.990 --> 20:10.139
Chai powder.

20:11.234 --> 20:13.459
Chai powder. We didn't
have that in the joint.

20:13.715 --> 20:16.925
Yeah, you dismissed, nigga.
Go handle your business.

20:21.255 --> 20:22.368
Yo, Tray.

20:23.737 --> 20:24.905
What's up?

20:25.450 --> 20:27.308
It's good to have you back, my brother.

20:29.277 --> 20:30.408
Good to be back.
