WEBVTT

00:14.962 --> 00:18.531
Where do you want me to look,
here to the camera or to you?

00:18.533 --> 00:19.966
Just look at me.
Nah, just ignore camera.

00:19.968 --> 00:23.570
Okay. Let's see. Grew
up in Washington D.C.

00:23.572 --> 00:25.538
My parents were diplomats.

00:25.540 --> 00:27.674
I attended GDS, it was a
private school in the city.

00:27.676 --> 00:30.543
I graduated high
school when I was 16.

00:30.545 --> 00:31.711
That's impressive.

00:31.713 --> 00:35.315
Well, not really. I started
early and skipped 8th grade.

00:35.317 --> 00:37.651
College was Columbia.

00:37.653 --> 00:40.287
Double major in history
and chemistry.

00:40.289 --> 00:41.488
Odd combination.

00:41.490 --> 00:43.957
No, not really, not really,

00:43.959 --> 00:47.761
not when you consider my work.

00:47.763 --> 00:50.363
After college I received

00:50.365 --> 00:54.768
my Masters in European
History from Oxford.

00:54.770 --> 00:56.870
I liked Oxford, I liked it a lot.

00:56.872 --> 00:59.340
That's where I met Annie.

01:00.342 --> 01:04.678
And then, uh, then here
to L.A. for my Ph.D.

01:04.680 --> 01:05.912
Why Los Angeles?

01:05.914 --> 01:09.883
The department chair,
Paul Zelevansky. He's, uh...

01:10.485 --> 01:14.854
He's by far the best
mind in my particular

01:14.856 --> 01:17.924
area of expertise.

01:17.926 --> 01:21.394
Which is...

01:21.396 --> 01:25.865
Yes, well, that is the heart
of the matter, isn't it?

01:25.867 --> 01:29.069
These letters...
They changed my life.

01:29.071 --> 01:32.939
My grandfather showed them
to me when I was about

01:32.941 --> 01:34.774
10 years old.

01:34.776 --> 01:36.576
And since then, the
subject of those letters

01:36.578 --> 01:39.446
has been the focal point
of my whole life.

01:40.981 --> 01:43.616
What is the subject?

01:47.488 --> 01:51.358
Well, uh, here goes.

01:51.360 --> 01:54.761
In the novel Frankenstein, the
opening narrative is told

01:54.763 --> 01:56.996
through a series of letters
that a Captain Walton

01:56.998 --> 01:59.065
writes to his sister,
Margaret Saville.

01:59.067 --> 02:01.935
Walton is an Arctic explorer, his
ship gets trapped in the ice,

02:01.937 --> 02:04.371
somewhere in the Arctic Circle,

02:04.373 --> 02:07.774
and it is there that he meets
Dr. Victor Frankenstein.

02:07.776 --> 02:09.675
He tells Walton his story.

02:09.678 --> 02:13.113
Walton then relates this
same story to his sister

02:13.115 --> 02:14.447
through a series of letters.

02:14.449 --> 02:18.017
And these letters form
the basis of the novel.

02:18.019 --> 02:23.323
These letters are the
basis of the novel.

02:23.625 --> 02:25.525
What are you saying exactly?

02:25.527 --> 02:28.995
I'm saying that, um...

02:28.997 --> 02:31.998
I'm saying that Mary
Shelley's Frankenstein,

02:32.000 --> 02:36.770
the novel, is a work
of non-fiction.

02:36.772 --> 02:39.038
I'm saying it's a work of
non-fiction disguised as fiction.

02:39.040 --> 02:43.777
Or, or more accurately,
it is a fictionalization of

02:43.779 --> 02:48.982
one of the most incredible,
true events in human history.

02:50.618 --> 02:52.852
Annie, what's up?

02:52.854 --> 02:55.789
Can I talk to you, please?

02:55.791 --> 02:58.458
Yes... Um...

02:58.460 --> 02:59.793
Can I talk to you now, please?

02:59.795 --> 03:01.795
Could you excuse me for
just one second, please?

03:01.797 --> 03:04.432
Yeah, of course. No problem.

03:10.806 --> 03:12.839
You want me to eavesdrop?

03:12.841 --> 03:14.007
Yeah.

03:14.009 --> 03:15.208
Good friend.

03:19.815 --> 03:22.482
They'll be here as long as they need to be.
Just tell them to go please.

03:22.484 --> 03:24.918
We talked about this. You
know that they gotta be here

03:24.920 --> 03:27.620
as long as they need to document me.
So you can do whatever you want,

03:27.622 --> 03:28.755
and I just have to live with it?

03:28.757 --> 03:32.025
You can let them finish what
they're doing and they'll leave.

03:32.027 --> 03:34.227
I don't even know what they are doing.
Should we go?

03:34.229 --> 03:36.663
Maybe I should just cancel my trip.
Yes, that'll be great.

03:36.665 --> 03:37.797
I guess, that's not
important to you.

03:37.799 --> 03:39.032
It's absolutely what you
do every single time.

03:39.034 --> 03:39.933
Don't "please" me.

03:39.935 --> 03:41.568
That has nothing to do with
what we are talking about now.

03:41.570 --> 03:43.703
Fine. You know what? Fuck you. Fuck
you. Do whatever the fuck you want.

03:43.705 --> 03:45.472
That's not good.

03:45.474 --> 03:48.475
Okay. Is everything okay?

03:48.477 --> 03:52.679
Yeah, I'm sorry about that. We
just got our schedules crossed.

03:52.681 --> 03:54.981
Sure, is it... Should we...

03:54.983 --> 03:58.820
take off and maybe come back tomorrow?
No, no, no, no, no, no.

04:00.822 --> 04:02.689
Yes. Maybe that's not a bad idea.

04:02.691 --> 04:06.059
- Sure thing, we'll do that. Okay.
- Okay.

04:10.865 --> 04:13.132
Luke, Luke.

04:13.134 --> 04:17.202
Hi! My name is Brian and I run
sound on a documentary film crew

04:17.204 --> 04:21.040
our latest subject is fucking...

04:21.041 --> 04:22.976
Frankenstein!

04:22.978 --> 04:26.746
Are you fucking kidding me, Vicky?

04:26.748 --> 04:28.014
You're welcome.

04:28.016 --> 04:32.519
Oh, thank you. You have
got some awesome friends.

04:32.521 --> 04:33.853
I can't wait to see
where this goes, man.

04:33.855 --> 04:36.122
Do not fuck this up. Guys,
do not fuck this up.

04:36.124 --> 04:38.057
I just spent an hour
talking him down.

04:38.059 --> 04:40.727
What I might fuck up
is his girlfriend.

04:40.729 --> 04:41.895
Oh, come on.

04:41.897 --> 04:43.963
Did you see her?
What she was wearing.

04:43.965 --> 04:45.532
Hey, stop it.

04:45.534 --> 04:47.534
She and I...

04:47.536 --> 04:48.568
Looked at me.

04:48.570 --> 04:49.936
Smelled me.

04:49.938 --> 04:53.139
All right, look, guys, I don't know
what's going on with her right now,

04:53.141 --> 04:56.042
'cause she's not usually this highly
strung, but we have got two days

04:56.044 --> 04:58.278
until we go to Canada and
she's not going with us.

04:58.280 --> 05:02.682
So just keep it together until then,
'cause I don't know about you,

05:02.684 --> 05:05.818
but I need this job.

05:24.872 --> 05:28.575
Okay, so we're back on
our way to Jonathan's.

05:28.577 --> 05:31.711
Hopefully today will go a little
smoother than yesterday did.

05:31.713 --> 05:35.014
Obviously, there's some tension,

05:35.016 --> 05:39.619
between Jonathan and Anne
over Jonathan's theory.

05:39.621 --> 05:42.589
I've known Jonathan since college.

05:42.591 --> 05:45.658
He always lets his
work take priority

05:45.660 --> 05:50.129
over the rest of his life,
it's just that right now...

05:55.102 --> 05:59.305
Sorry. Um... Where was I?

05:59.307 --> 06:03.142
You were talking about your obsessive,
slightly insane friend who is

06:03.144 --> 06:05.878
looking for Frankenstein.

06:05.880 --> 06:08.314
Brian, and I say this with love,

06:08.316 --> 06:10.216
please have some
respect for Jonathan.

06:10.218 --> 06:12.986
He's a friend of mine.

06:12.988 --> 06:14.687
And if that's not enough,

06:14.689 --> 06:17.390
do I need to remind you,
he's paying for all of this?

06:17.392 --> 06:20.627
He has my undying respect...
As does his girlfriend.

06:20.629 --> 06:21.861
Oh, my God!

06:23.064 --> 06:24.631
What the fuck!

06:24.633 --> 06:25.765
I'm so sorry.

06:25.767 --> 06:28.201
Get the fuck out of the car!
I'm so sorry, I didn't see you.

06:28.203 --> 06:30.637
Get the fuck out of the car.
Get the fuck out of the car!

06:30.639 --> 06:31.804
I'm sorry!

06:31.806 --> 06:35.141
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

06:35.143 --> 06:37.377
Jesus!

06:40.414 --> 06:42.915
Fucking...

06:53.093 --> 06:56.162
Okay, let's go.

06:56.164 --> 06:58.765
You sure you're okay?

06:58.767 --> 07:01.834
Yeah. I'm fine. Busy day.

07:10.377 --> 07:14.447
The Illuminati was a secret society that
was founded in Ingolstadt University

07:14.449 --> 07:17.150
in the late 18th century.

07:17.852 --> 07:21.421
Now central to their work was
discovering the origin of life,

07:21.423 --> 07:24.057
which they felt was the
key to immortality.

07:24.059 --> 07:29.796
They worked relentlessly and they
passed on information and experiments

07:29.798 --> 07:34.434
so what you have, if you can imagine it,
is the greatest scientific minds in Europe

07:34.436 --> 07:38.271
building upon each
generation's work.

07:38.273 --> 07:40.306
Culminating in the creation

07:40.308 --> 07:45.344
of what most people call
the Frankenstein Monster.

07:45.346 --> 07:49.982
The actual creator was
Johann Venkenheim,

07:49.984 --> 07:54.420
he was my grandfather's
great-great-grandfather.

07:54.422 --> 07:58.491
This is Johann's lab.

07:58.493 --> 08:01.728
So what does this prove exactly?

08:01.730 --> 08:03.963
What does it...
Well, it's a genetics lab.

08:03.965 --> 08:06.165
That's from my family's
photo archives.

08:06.167 --> 08:10.069
That was the first of its kind.
I mean, fuck Mendel,

08:10.071 --> 08:12.505
Johann was the father
of modern genetics.

08:12.507 --> 08:14.807
His work predates Mendel
by over half a century.

08:14.809 --> 08:18.845
While Mendel was splitting peas
and fooling around with flowers,

08:18.847 --> 08:22.081
Johann was bringing something
miraculous into the world.

08:22.083 --> 08:26.419
Something that's never been done
before, hasn't been done since.

08:26.421 --> 08:30.289
And who do I read
about in a text book?

08:30.291 --> 08:35.461
At any rate this, this lab...
This is where he created him.

08:35.462 --> 08:37.230
Can you explain that?

08:37.232 --> 08:38.898
The technique?

08:38.900 --> 08:42.971
No, I can't. Unfortunately.
The technique is lost.

08:44.973 --> 08:48.174
The notes, the research destroyed.

08:48.176 --> 08:51.144
It seems that Johann and
whoever assisted him,

08:51.146 --> 08:55.414
they were so frightened or
appalled by what they'd created,

08:55.416 --> 08:58.251
that they destroyed everything

08:58.253 --> 09:02.855
so that the experiment
could never be recreated.

09:02.857 --> 09:05.158
That sucks.

09:05.160 --> 09:08.194
That sucks?

09:08.196 --> 09:10.863
Yeah, it sucks. It
sucks because it means

09:10.865 --> 09:14.167
no matter how much evidence I collect,
no matter how much data I collect,

09:14.169 --> 09:19.906
my theory will never be
accepted until I find him.

09:20.908 --> 09:24.877
And I can say now with
the utmost confidence

09:24.879 --> 09:28.982
that the Frankenstein
Monster is real.

09:29.984 --> 09:33.954
That he exists, and he's alive now,

09:35.156 --> 09:37.456
and I think I can find him.

09:43.330 --> 09:47.133
You know, Jonathan's theory is

09:47.135 --> 09:49.902
a lot to swallow.

09:49.904 --> 09:54.240
So I just don't want people
getting a bad impression of him.

09:54.242 --> 09:56.209
But do you believe it?

09:56.211 --> 09:58.211
What exactly are you
asking me here?

09:58.213 --> 10:04.150
Do you believe that there
is a Frankenstein Monster?

10:04.152 --> 10:06.385
Just take that and come here.

10:06.387 --> 10:08.421
Excuse me.

10:08.423 --> 10:11.023
Don't you know he's on
suspension from the University?

10:11.025 --> 10:12.358
Really?

10:12.360 --> 10:13.893
Yeah.

10:13.895 --> 10:15.228
No, I didn't know that.

10:15.230 --> 10:19.265
Well, he's embarrassed about it.

10:19.267 --> 10:25.238
Jonathan is obsessed with
this bullshit theory.

10:25.240 --> 10:27.974
You know it, I know it.

10:27.976 --> 10:31.110
I mean, it's all he talks about.

10:31.112 --> 10:36.482
He barely sleeps, barely
eats, barely talks to me.

10:36.484 --> 10:39.418
It is ruining him
and you're helping.

10:39.420 --> 10:41.621
And you're gonna go
off to the Arctic.

10:41.623 --> 10:46.092
You're gonna be in search of this
Frankenstein, and you aren't gonna find him.

10:46.094 --> 10:49.528
Because to answer your question,
no, he doesn't exist.

10:49.530 --> 10:52.031
You know that.

10:52.033 --> 10:56.102
But Jonathan, let me tell
you he's not gonna give up.

10:56.104 --> 10:59.071
This is not gonna end well.

11:02.576 --> 11:06.479
This is the first movement
of Mozart's requiem.

11:06.481 --> 11:09.181
He wrote it on his deathbed.

11:09.183 --> 11:11.183
It started out as a
commission piece

11:11.185 --> 11:15.454
but ultimately ended up
becoming his own requiem.

11:15.456 --> 11:19.125
So I wanted to propose a
toast, if that's all right.

11:22.330 --> 11:27.133
The British explorer Freya Stark
once said, "There is no happiness

11:27.135 --> 11:31.337
"in the things that we believe if they're
different than the things that we do."

11:31.339 --> 11:35.207
Now, tomorrow will be

11:35.209 --> 11:39.578
for me the first step in what stands to
be the most important chapter of my life.

11:39.580 --> 11:43.349
It's definitely the fulfilment
of a lifelong goal for me.

11:43.351 --> 11:46.385
Tomorrow, the things that I
do will be in line finally

11:46.387 --> 11:48.387
with the things that I believe in.

11:48.389 --> 11:51.057
I want to thank everybody
here for being a part of it.

11:51.059 --> 11:53.894
So thanks. And cheers.

11:55.496 --> 11:58.030
Cheers.

11:58.032 --> 11:59.665
Cheers.

13:25.520 --> 13:28.754
Okay, it took us two flights to
get here, we're in Whitehorse,

13:28.756 --> 13:31.490
which is in the southern
part of the Yukon.

13:31.492 --> 13:33.325
And Jonathan and Eric
have gone to get the car

13:33.327 --> 13:38.664
so we'll be traveling from...
By land from here on out.

13:38.666 --> 13:40.366
God, it's beautiful here.

13:40.368 --> 13:42.601
It's fucking freezing here!

13:42.603 --> 13:45.671
Well, where we're going, it's
only going to get colder.

13:45.673 --> 13:47.139
Great.

13:47.141 --> 13:52.178
"O wind, if winter comes,
can spring be far behind?"

13:53.580 --> 13:55.347
Let's go!

13:58.785 --> 14:01.587
What's the plan, Jonathan?

14:01.589 --> 14:05.858
Well, right now we're going
to make a quick detour,

14:05.860 --> 14:09.261
we're gonna meet up with
a person of interest,

14:09.263 --> 14:11.664
and then, we're going
to hit the road.

14:11.666 --> 14:16.702
We're gonna go east out of the Yukon,
into the Northwest Territories.

14:16.704 --> 14:20.239
We're going to rendezvous
with our guide in Deline.

14:20.241 --> 14:22.842
And then into the wild.

14:24.811 --> 14:28.581
So you were saying about the drawings,
they're from a real murder?

14:28.583 --> 14:30.182
That drawing right there

14:30.184 --> 14:33.119
which is drawn by a 16-year-old
boy is an actual...

14:33.121 --> 14:34.420
This here?

14:34.422 --> 14:36.422
We know that's
obviously a photocopy,

14:36.424 --> 14:39.725
but the original's in
my family archives.

14:39.727 --> 14:41.627
But this is from a murder trial.

14:41.629 --> 14:42.795
In Geneva in 1802.

14:42.797 --> 14:46.565
A governess was accused
of murdering a small boy,

14:46.567 --> 14:49.335
a member of the family that
she worked for actually.

14:49.337 --> 14:52.705
It was my family, the Venkenheims.

14:53.874 --> 14:57.476
But I think that in reality

14:57.478 --> 15:02.548
this child was kidnapped
and killed by the creature...

15:02.550 --> 15:05.718
I think I've driven past it.

15:05.720 --> 15:08.754
It should be around here
somewhere. Look for 8412.

15:08.756 --> 15:10.222
Oh, no, here it is.

15:10.224 --> 15:13.526
Okay, we're here.

15:13.528 --> 15:14.894
Where is here?

15:14.896 --> 15:19.865
Uh, this is Clarence Malusky.

15:19.867 --> 15:24.170
Apparently he survived
an encounter.

15:24.172 --> 15:26.205
Is he a friend of yours?

15:26.207 --> 15:28.507
Oh no. I've never actually met him.

15:32.746 --> 15:35.548
Okay.

15:35.550 --> 15:37.449
Hello.

15:54.668 --> 15:57.536
Clarence? It's Jonathan.

15:59.673 --> 16:00.940
Whoa, I'm sorry.

16:00.942 --> 16:02.408
Who the fuck are you?

16:02.410 --> 16:05.444
I'm looking for Clarence.
I'm sorry, I'm Jonathan.

16:05.446 --> 16:09.248
That's me. What do you want?

16:09.250 --> 16:13.919
We're here to film the... I talked
to you on the phone about filming.

16:13.921 --> 16:18.757
Oh. I guess today is
the day you're coming.

16:18.759 --> 16:20.459
I guess so.

16:22.996 --> 16:24.430
Fuck you, Mike!

16:24.432 --> 16:26.599
Fuck you, Clarence!

16:26.601 --> 16:29.735
To hell with him.

16:42.749 --> 16:46.385
Sorry about the mess.
Behind in my chores.

16:51.291 --> 16:53.425
Hi.

16:53.427 --> 16:55.761
Hello.

16:57.330 --> 16:59.031
You're pretty hot.

16:59.033 --> 17:01.500
Um, thank you.

17:01.502 --> 17:04.737
I was hoping you could
just tell them...

17:04.739 --> 17:06.405
You got a boyfriend?

17:06.406 --> 17:08.807
Uh, I... Yes.

17:08.809 --> 17:10.876
Yeah? You got a
boyfriend in Canada?

17:10.877 --> 17:12.611
Clarence, I think that
we're all hoping...

17:12.613 --> 17:16.815
Hey, whatever you want, money man.

17:16.817 --> 17:17.983
What do you want?

17:17.984 --> 17:22.288
I was hoping that, uh,
you might tell us

17:22.290 --> 17:24.723
about the encounter
that you told me about?

17:24.724 --> 17:27.726
Yeah. That's some
freaky ass shit, man.

17:27.728 --> 17:31.730
I was selling meth to roughnecks
up in Fort Chipeywan and...

17:36.970 --> 17:39.438
I don't want to talk
about it any more.

17:39.440 --> 17:43.008
Can we talk about something else?
No. I think we have to...

17:43.010 --> 17:44.610
I'd like it if we can
talk about this.

17:44.612 --> 17:46.612
We would really love
to hear your story.

17:46.614 --> 17:50.582
What do you want to talk about?

17:50.584 --> 17:53.052
The weather.

17:53.054 --> 17:57.856
Well, Clarence, maybe we
should get back on point.

17:57.858 --> 18:00.693
You wanna talk about it,
we'll fucking talk about.

18:00.695 --> 18:03.462
I was up at fucking Fort Chipeywan
looking at the Northern Lights.

18:03.464 --> 18:07.099
There wasn't shit around me, nobody
fucking around me but ice, snow

18:07.101 --> 18:09.501
and the goddamn lights and
then some fucking guy appears.

18:09.503 --> 18:10.736
And he's fucking huge.

18:10.738 --> 18:14.340
He's huge and I'm like...

18:14.342 --> 18:18.163
You know, "Hey, man, what's going on?
"What are you doing out here?

18:18.189 --> 18:19.912
You're checking out the lights?"
And he starts coming at me.

18:19.914 --> 18:22.748
And he just gets bigger, and
bigger, and fucking bigger.

18:22.750 --> 18:27.486
And then he looks at me like he's
gonna fucking kill me, okay?

18:27.488 --> 18:29.054
And then he doesn't.

18:29.056 --> 18:30.989
He walks away, and I went home

18:30.991 --> 18:33.692
and threw up all over
the place. What else?

18:33.694 --> 18:37.129
Did you talk to him?
Did you say anything to him?

18:37.131 --> 18:39.865
Did you hear what I just said?

18:39.867 --> 18:41.900
This motherfucker
could snap me in two.

18:41.902 --> 18:45.604
You think I'm going to ask him
if he wants some mac and cheese?

18:45.606 --> 18:48.974
I'm telling you, okay, he was a
person but he wasn't a person.

18:48.976 --> 18:51.643
I know that it doesn't make
sense, but it does make sense.

18:51.645 --> 18:52.778
It makes sense.

18:52.780 --> 18:55.080
Yes, it makes sense.

18:55.082 --> 18:58.650
Clarence, I want you
to look at this.

18:58.652 --> 19:00.719
Holy shit, man!

19:00.721 --> 19:02.388
This is him.

19:02.390 --> 19:03.489
That's him!

19:03.491 --> 19:04.957
That's fucking him, man.

19:04.959 --> 19:06.825
Okay, that is weird.

19:06.827 --> 19:09.762
I'm freaking out right now.
Who the fuck is this guy?

19:09.764 --> 19:12.564
You've heard of Frankenstein?
That's him.

19:18.772 --> 19:22.741
Fuck, man, I was kicking
it with Frankenstein!

19:27.180 --> 19:29.548
Goddamn, you are hot.

19:29.550 --> 19:32.885
So, seriously, who the fuck is this?

19:32.887 --> 19:34.987
I am being serious.

19:34.989 --> 19:36.755
That's him.

19:36.757 --> 19:38.857
It's complicated.

19:45.498 --> 19:47.699
What the fuck is going on?

19:47.701 --> 19:50.202
What do you mean?

19:51.771 --> 19:53.839
Do I look like a fucking retard?

19:53.841 --> 19:55.107
No, no, no.

19:55.109 --> 19:56.875
Why are you really here?

19:56.877 --> 19:58.911
And don't give me any of
this Frankenstein bullshit.

19:58.913 --> 20:01.113
Do I look fucking stupid to you?

20:01.115 --> 20:04.450
No. Clarence, relax we're...
You! Motherfucker.

20:04.452 --> 20:06.685
Who the fuck are you listening to?

20:06.687 --> 20:08.454
I'm doing sound, man.

20:08.456 --> 20:10.122
Spying on me, huh?

20:10.124 --> 20:13.125
Clarence!

20:13.127 --> 20:16.094
It's a microphone.

20:16.096 --> 20:17.729
It's your...

20:17.731 --> 20:19.698
He's just part of
my crew, Clarence.

20:19.700 --> 20:20.866
Okay, okay, okay.

20:20.868 --> 20:22.835
Fuck me.

20:22.837 --> 20:24.870
You. Empty your pockets.

20:24.872 --> 20:26.805
Empty your fucking pockets!

20:26.807 --> 20:28.240
Shut the fuck up!

20:28.242 --> 20:29.942
Shut the fuck up.

20:29.944 --> 20:33.679
Clarence, relax, please, relax.

20:33.681 --> 20:35.981
Clarence, relax, Clarence.

20:35.983 --> 20:38.050
We are not here to hurt you.

20:38.052 --> 20:39.518
Why would we want to hurt you?

20:39.520 --> 20:42.921
I don't know, man. You tell me.

20:42.923 --> 20:44.223
We don't want to.

20:44.225 --> 20:47.693
We just wanted to ask you
a couple of questions.

20:47.695 --> 20:48.927
You answered them.

20:48.929 --> 20:50.963
And you did a really great job

20:50.965 --> 20:55.901
and now I think we should
probably leave, we'll leave.

21:02.877 --> 21:07.112
Whoa! Whoa! Fuck, man.

21:07.114 --> 21:09.248
Whoa! That could...

21:09.250 --> 21:11.650
Okay, so everyone back...

21:11.652 --> 21:13.719
Money man, I'll tell the story.

21:13.721 --> 21:16.989
I don't even need to talk, you
guys tell me some shit, you know.

21:16.991 --> 21:20.092
If it's okay, we've got
to get back on schedule.

21:20.094 --> 21:21.560
Really?

21:21.562 --> 21:23.095
Fuck, guys, I'm sorry.

21:23.097 --> 21:26.265
You were just trying to do your job, man.
And I'm like... I'm sorry, man.

21:26.267 --> 21:29.568
I'm fucking sorry.
I'm really, really sorry.

21:35.542 --> 21:36.775
Well, that was fun.

21:36.777 --> 21:40.746
I'm sorry. I'm very
sorry, all right,

21:40.748 --> 21:44.049
I did not know that that man

21:44.051 --> 21:47.319
was going to be that unstable.

21:47.321 --> 21:49.888
I really do apologize.

21:49.890 --> 21:52.858
Unstable.

21:52.860 --> 21:54.192
I know. I know.

21:54.194 --> 21:55.727
He was just unstable.

21:55.729 --> 21:56.862
My mom's unstable.

21:56.864 --> 21:58.830
That was a meth head
who pulled a gun.

21:58.832 --> 22:01.833
Yeah, and made me empty my
pockets and sniffed my wallet.

22:01.835 --> 22:02.901
He sniffed his wallet.

22:02.903 --> 22:05.704
Guys, it's all right,
we got great footage.

22:05.706 --> 22:08.974
We did get some really good information,
some very solid information.

22:08.976 --> 22:10.676
Did we, good?
You know what else we got?

22:10.678 --> 22:11.910
We got a gun pulled on us.

22:11.912 --> 22:13.946
We got a meth head
sniffing our wallets

22:13.948 --> 22:16.815
and pulling guns on us. Thank you.

22:16.817 --> 22:20.752
Yeah. Thanks. From
the crew, thank you.

22:25.925 --> 22:30.896
Yeah, okay, so here
we are in Deline.

22:30.898 --> 22:34.099
We are in the heart of the
Northwest Territories now.

22:34.101 --> 22:36.602
And it's cold.

22:36.604 --> 22:38.637
I'm gonna go head off and try
to meet up with our guide.

22:38.639 --> 22:42.174
He's gonna suit us up and supply us

22:42.176 --> 22:44.710
with snowmobiles and
we're gonna head out.

22:44.712 --> 22:46.378
And I feel excited,

22:46.380 --> 22:52.084
because this feels like the
beginning of our adventure!

22:52.086 --> 22:54.953
So, yeah...

22:54.955 --> 22:56.955
Was that good?
Yeah. It was great.

22:56.957 --> 23:00.092
Okay, I'm heading out.
All right. See you in a bit.

23:03.363 --> 23:07.766
So what do you guys
think of lovely Deline?

23:07.768 --> 23:11.036
I think this place sucks, worse
than the last place we were in.

23:11.038 --> 23:14.106
It's definitely colder, but I
don't think it sucks any worse.

23:14.108 --> 23:15.641
Totally sucks worse.

23:15.643 --> 23:20.345
No, we've hit a real, you know,
consistent level volume of suck.

23:20.347 --> 23:21.847
We're in a suck downhill spiral.

23:21.849 --> 23:23.382
Guys, just cut it out.

23:23.384 --> 23:24.816
Constant suck.

23:24.818 --> 23:27.085
This is enough.

23:29.289 --> 23:32.224
Ooh, that'll be fun, snowmobiles!

23:37.864 --> 23:42.668
Okay, guys, this is our
guide, Karl McCallion.

23:42.670 --> 23:44.670
Karl, this is everybody.

23:44.672 --> 23:45.837
How you doing?

23:45.839 --> 23:46.905
Hi, Karl.

23:46.907 --> 23:49.775
I'm Vicky Stephens,
it's nice to meet you.

23:49.777 --> 23:51.143
You're making the movie, huh?

23:51.145 --> 23:52.244
That's right.

23:52.246 --> 23:55.881
Yeah, Jonathan, told me
that was part of the deal,

23:55.883 --> 23:58.183
but I ain't no actor or nothin'.

23:58.185 --> 24:00.919
Oh, well, that's okay, we're not
really making that kind of movie.

24:00.921 --> 24:03.388
This is a documentary.

24:03.390 --> 24:07.693
Yeah. Look, I don't
mean no disrespect,

24:07.695 --> 24:12.731
but you guys don't look like you've
spent much time in the wilderness.

24:12.733 --> 24:13.899
That would be true.

24:13.901 --> 24:16.735
This ain't backyard camping, guys.

24:16.737 --> 24:18.870
It gets pretty cold up there.

24:18.872 --> 24:21.306
You wander off, you die.
That simple.

24:21.308 --> 24:23.275
Now, you listen to me,

24:23.277 --> 24:25.977
you'll make your movie and
we'll have a good time.

24:25.979 --> 24:30.482
You don't listen to me, things
are gonna get ugly pretty quick.

24:30.484 --> 24:33.151
It's not just the cold,
there's polar bear.

24:33.153 --> 24:37.022
We get close enough to the ocean
maybe have to deal with some walrus.

24:37.024 --> 24:38.256
Walrus?

24:38.258 --> 24:42.794
Yeah, 1500 kilograms with
tusks as long as your arm.

24:42.796 --> 24:44.296
Kilograms?

24:44.298 --> 24:46.231
Now, you're payin' me
so I work for you.

24:46.233 --> 24:50.102
But up there, what
I say goes. Got it?

24:50.104 --> 24:52.838
Sir, yes, sir!

24:52.840 --> 24:54.306
Sir, yes, sir?

24:54.308 --> 24:55.474
What?

24:55.476 --> 24:57.776
You trying to be a smart
ass, or something?

24:57.778 --> 24:59.778
No.

25:02.448 --> 25:04.750
You know, I don't want to start off

25:04.752 --> 25:07.886
on the wrong foot here, guys, okay.

25:07.888 --> 25:11.022
I need you to listen to me

25:11.024 --> 25:14.126
and I don't need you
to be a smart ass.

25:14.128 --> 25:17.963
We understand each other? Good.

25:17.965 --> 25:21.900
Now I'm gonna unhook those snowmobiles
and put them on that truck.

25:21.902 --> 25:24.469
You guys keep warm.

25:24.471 --> 25:26.938
We'll get along fine.

25:45.458 --> 25:48.393
Nice and sturdy, you
gotta shake them.

25:51.464 --> 25:55.200
Karl scares me.

25:55.202 --> 25:57.135
Oh, and that's a gun.

25:57.137 --> 25:59.171
Now he really scares me.

26:02.542 --> 26:04.409
You need any help, Karl?

26:04.411 --> 26:06.111
No.

26:10.416 --> 26:12.584
All right, boys.

26:27.066 --> 26:30.101
Luke. Luke. Luke.
Get this, get this.

26:52.859 --> 26:55.193
Really.

26:55.195 --> 27:00.165
Luke, are you laughing?
I fucking hate you guys. Jesus.

27:00.167 --> 27:04.269
Annie... Can I...
Can I say something?

27:04.271 --> 27:08.540
Well, can I say some...
Stop. Please can I...

27:08.542 --> 27:11.943
Anne... I know I didn't,
I'm in the middle of nowhere.

27:11.945 --> 27:15.046
Do you want to do this right now?
Really?

27:15.048 --> 27:17.616
Can I talk to you about this
when I get home, please?

27:17.618 --> 27:22.420
I can't hear you, Annie...
Annie, I'm losing you.

27:22.422 --> 27:24.623
I can't hear you. Annie?

27:39.006 --> 27:41.940
Everything okay?

27:41.942 --> 27:44.209
Yeah.

27:46.045 --> 27:49.180
She's breaking up with me.
She's moving out.

27:53.119 --> 27:55.520
I'm sorry.

28:00.159 --> 28:02.093
Whatever. Let's just go.

28:32.626 --> 28:34.993
What's this area over here?
What's this right here.

28:34.995 --> 28:36.161
There's nothing around here.

28:36.163 --> 28:39.531
This is Potters Gulch.
So it's deserted all around here.

28:39.533 --> 28:42.300
Potters Gulch.

28:42.302 --> 28:46.538
Great. That's perfect.
That's where we go first.

28:46.540 --> 28:48.373
But there's nothing there
I already told you.

28:48.375 --> 28:50.108
I know, that's where we're going.

28:50.110 --> 28:51.209
Here?

28:51.211 --> 28:54.012
Right here.

28:54.014 --> 28:56.614
All right, you wanna see
nothing, we go there, you know.

29:07.026 --> 29:09.594
Johann wanted to cheat death.

29:09.596 --> 29:12.230
That was the point.

29:12.232 --> 29:17.502
This creature was essentially
an experiment in longevity.

29:17.504 --> 29:20.739
You know, there are certain animals,
that have extraordinary lifespans.

29:20.741 --> 29:24.476
Giant tortoises, for example,
can live to be 300 years old.

29:24.478 --> 29:28.713
Some species of birds can live to
be 200 years old, sometimes more.

29:28.715 --> 29:32.350
So, Johann, would
have combined the DNA

29:32.352 --> 29:35.553
of these creatures,
theoretically with human DNA.

29:35.555 --> 29:39.024
And what you would have is

29:39.026 --> 29:41.092
a creature that could
live for centuries.

29:41.094 --> 29:44.262
Whose body would resist
disease, would heal itself,

29:44.264 --> 29:49.467
would have immense strength,
stamina and intelligence.

29:49.469 --> 29:53.104
What do you expect to have
happen if you encounter it?

29:53.106 --> 29:58.476
Look, obviously, I know that
it's dangerous, I know that.

29:58.478 --> 30:01.413
You think that's why Johann
destroyed his notes?

30:01.415 --> 30:05.683
Johann's relationship with the
creature was complicated.

30:05.685 --> 30:08.453
I mean, as you can imagine,
a lot of the early interaction

30:08.455 --> 30:10.755
with it was disastrous.

30:10.757 --> 30:14.526
This creature has enormous
destructive potential.

30:14.528 --> 30:16.327
But we are talking about
something that is intelligent,

30:16.329 --> 30:18.763
that is not a mindless monster
and Johann knew this.

30:18.765 --> 30:20.765
You know, this creature that he
created, this is his legacy.

30:20.767 --> 30:24.769
But this isn't about
personal vindication,

30:24.771 --> 30:27.072
because within this creature,
there are scientific...

30:27.074 --> 30:31.509
There are medical marvels,
with incredible potential.

30:31.511 --> 30:33.745
It's not just about
personal vindication.

30:45.658 --> 30:47.759
End of the road, guys.

30:47.761 --> 30:50.695
Snowmobiles from here in.

30:50.697 --> 30:52.497
Can we just leave the car here?

30:52.499 --> 30:53.698
Yeah.

31:34.640 --> 31:36.508
All right, guys, gather around.

31:36.510 --> 31:38.276
You watching?

31:38.278 --> 31:40.545
This is a brake, on my right,

31:40.547 --> 31:45.283
this is the accelerator, and
this is the kill switch.

31:45.285 --> 31:46.751
Pretty simple.

31:46.753 --> 31:47.919
Now just beyond the property line,

31:47.921 --> 31:52.590
we're gonna be going 70 kilometers
straight through the tundra.

31:52.592 --> 31:55.160
We're going to camp overnight.

31:55.162 --> 31:57.362
I'll get you to Potters
Gulch the next day, okay?

31:57.364 --> 31:58.596
Okay.

31:58.598 --> 32:01.533
Now it's gonna be 20,
30 below, pretty cold.

32:01.535 --> 32:03.234
You gotta stay warm, okay?

32:03.236 --> 32:06.638
I'm sorry, is that... "20, 30 below,"
is that Fahrenheit or Celsius?

32:06.640 --> 32:08.206
That's Celsius.

32:08.208 --> 32:10.808
Okay, so that's like...

32:10.810 --> 32:13.878
It's really fucking cold,
that's all you have to know.

32:13.880 --> 32:15.513
You sure you're up for this?

32:15.515 --> 32:16.948
Absolutely!

32:16.950 --> 32:20.351
All right, let's get you
on the snowmobiles.

32:23.456 --> 32:25.390
I can't zip my coat.

32:28.394 --> 32:30.962
Hey, Luke, let's hop on. Come on.

32:33.699 --> 32:37.602
All right. Wait, wait,
wait, wait. Okay, I'm on.

33:43.969 --> 33:47.839
Potter's Gulch is right
through that pass.

33:47.841 --> 33:51.376
This is some beautiful country.

33:51.378 --> 33:54.746
Sure is.

33:59.819 --> 34:01.519
What's that?

34:01.521 --> 34:03.554
Just wolves.

34:03.556 --> 34:04.956
Just wolves?

34:04.958 --> 34:07.558
They ain't interested in us.

34:07.560 --> 34:09.860
Why is that not reassuring?

34:09.862 --> 34:12.429
It's the bears you
have to worry about.

34:12.431 --> 34:14.331
That's why.

34:14.333 --> 34:16.467
All right, we're gonna set
up camp not far from here,

34:16.469 --> 34:19.304
so we better get going.
We're losing daylight.

34:28.480 --> 34:30.481
Man, it's cold!

34:38.489 --> 34:42.460
Hi, Vicky, it's Eric, your
faithful associate producer,

34:42.462 --> 34:45.429
loyal, second camera operator.

34:45.431 --> 34:47.965
I thought I'd give you
a little Easter Egg

34:47.967 --> 34:50.467
for when you start editing this.

34:50.469 --> 34:52.837
I'm out here, in the freezing cold

34:52.839 --> 34:57.575
getting you your time lapse shot... I still
think Luke should be shooting this...

34:57.577 --> 35:02.647
But he's in there with the rest
of you guys, warm, comfortable.

35:02.649 --> 35:07.051
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

35:07.053 --> 35:09.053
Eric's always fine.

35:15.562 --> 35:19.964
Hello? Luke?

35:19.966 --> 35:23.401
Hello?

35:23.403 --> 35:25.770
Who's there?

35:25.772 --> 35:29.807
Fuck! Jesus!

35:31.710 --> 35:35.113
Luke? Hello?

36:06.111 --> 36:09.080
Oh, crap, you scared
the crap out of me.

36:13.085 --> 36:15.119
Let's get inside.

36:21.594 --> 36:24.061
How are you feeling
about the trip so far?

36:24.063 --> 36:27.732
Oh, God, I feel great.
I feel really great.

36:27.734 --> 36:30.601
I know it's gonna sound weird,

36:30.603 --> 36:34.071
but it's like I can feel
his presence out here.

36:34.073 --> 36:36.707
He's out there somewhere.

36:36.709 --> 36:40.044
It's got me feeling excited...

36:40.046 --> 36:42.513
Oh, fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck.

36:42.515 --> 36:44.515
It's fucking freezing.

36:44.517 --> 36:46.784
I'm pissing inside next time.
I don't fucking care.

36:46.786 --> 36:48.653
I can't do. Can you?

36:48.655 --> 36:54.692
I swear to God, my penis,
it shrunk, it looks like Eric's.

36:54.694 --> 36:58.596
Oh, fuck this place, it sucks here.

37:01.201 --> 37:02.834
Are you kidding me?

37:02.836 --> 37:07.004
Are you kidding me? I almost
just got eaten! Oh, my God.

37:07.006 --> 37:08.873
Wake him up.

37:08.875 --> 37:12.543
Karl, wake up. I think you
got to shoot something.

37:12.545 --> 37:13.678
Karl. Karl!

37:13.680 --> 37:14.846
What?

37:14.848 --> 37:19.016
Wolves. Close.
You gotta do something.

37:19.018 --> 37:21.252
I already told you not
to worry about it.

37:21.254 --> 37:23.788
But if you wake me up again,
I'll throw you to 'em.

37:28.828 --> 37:30.995
Awesome fucking country.

39:07.292 --> 39:10.027
Welcome to Potters Gulch.

39:11.830 --> 39:14.298
Population, us.

39:20.238 --> 39:21.973
It's just one cabin?

39:21.975 --> 39:23.608
It's a yurt.

39:23.610 --> 39:25.676
What's a yurt?

39:25.678 --> 39:31.015
Trappers and hunters use them
as shelter in the wilderness.

39:31.017 --> 39:32.717
You got your trap lines set out

39:32.719 --> 39:36.721
over couple of hundred
kilometers of Arctic wilderness,

39:36.723 --> 39:42.259
you stay in the yurts scattered
across your trap lines.

39:42.261 --> 39:45.329
That one's about 100 years old.

39:45.331 --> 39:47.031
Pretty sturdy, huh?

39:47.033 --> 39:49.200
Yeah, works for me.

39:49.202 --> 39:53.638
Beats the hell out
of that stupid tent.

39:53.640 --> 39:55.206
What do you think?

39:55.208 --> 39:57.642
It makes sense.

39:57.644 --> 40:01.979
It's great. This is exactly
what I was looking for.

40:01.981 --> 40:06.817
Karl, where's the nearest house or the
nearest structure other than this one?

40:09.121 --> 40:11.956
Fifty, 60 kilometers. Maybe more.

40:13.259 --> 40:15.059
This really is the
middle of nowhere.

40:15.061 --> 40:16.994
It makes sense.

40:16.996 --> 40:18.829
Hey, check this out.

40:18.831 --> 40:20.798
What?

40:24.870 --> 40:26.237
Bones?

40:26.239 --> 40:29.674
That's gnarly.

40:29.676 --> 40:31.142
Is this what I think it is?

40:31.144 --> 40:32.276
Yeah.

40:32.278 --> 40:34.345
Maybe the monster is real.

40:38.050 --> 40:40.017
All right, it's creepy.

40:40.019 --> 40:42.887
Come on, let's get the
equipment inside.

40:47.759 --> 40:49.860
Okay, here goes...

40:53.799 --> 40:55.733
Oh, wow!

40:58.470 --> 41:00.337
Wow.

41:05.444 --> 41:09.113
It's not much warmer
in here, is it?

41:09.115 --> 41:13.217
It will be once we
get a fire going.

41:13.219 --> 41:14.752
I'll gather up some wood.

41:14.754 --> 41:17.054
Why don't you come with me?

41:17.056 --> 41:19.190
Yeah.

41:33.472 --> 41:34.939
Jesus!

41:36.242 --> 41:39.777
This place gives me the creeps, man.
I know. It's desolate, right?

41:39.779 --> 41:44.281
That forest is super creepy. I bet there's
lots of bears and wolves, I'm sure.

41:44.283 --> 41:46.851
You go in there at night, you
ain't ever coming back out.

41:46.853 --> 41:49.520
Trust me, I ain't going
in there day or night.

41:49.522 --> 41:51.422
Better not.

41:54.192 --> 41:56.060
Nice sunset, eh, boys?

41:56.062 --> 41:59.230
We were just talking
about that, Karl.

41:59.232 --> 42:02.233
For a couple of grasshoppers,
you did good today.

42:02.235 --> 42:05.169
Congrats, huh, partner.

42:06.538 --> 42:07.872
Whoa!

42:07.874 --> 42:09.173
What?

42:09.175 --> 42:11.108
Nothing. Thought I saw
something out there.

42:11.110 --> 42:12.943
Let's get inside.
This place is creepy.

42:19.184 --> 42:21.886
So, how are you feeling?

42:21.888 --> 42:24.054
Good.

42:24.056 --> 42:28.492
I feel... I feel very good.

42:28.494 --> 42:31.428
We're in the right
spot, I know that.

42:31.430 --> 42:33.564
How do you know that?

42:33.566 --> 42:38.502
Ah! From the data
I've collected. I can...

42:38.504 --> 42:39.870
Come on.

42:39.872 --> 42:42.072
You've been dodging this
question since L.A.

42:42.074 --> 42:43.174
Have I?

42:43.176 --> 42:44.408
You have, yeah.

42:44.410 --> 42:49.113
You know you have.
Complete transparency.

42:49.115 --> 42:50.447
Do you wanna look at
the map I brought?

42:50.449 --> 42:51.582
I'd love to.

42:51.584 --> 42:53.117
Okay.

42:53.119 --> 42:54.919
After Johann's death,

42:54.921 --> 42:58.422
when the creature migrated
into Canada, into the Arctic,

42:58.424 --> 43:01.859
vegetation would have been very
sparse, specially in the winter.

43:01.861 --> 43:04.562
In some areas, it would have
been totally non-existent.

43:04.564 --> 43:06.964
It would make sense that
he subsisted on meat.

43:06.966 --> 43:12.002
Now, it's my theory, that he's
following a large herd of caribou.

43:12.004 --> 43:16.040
Which actually makes his
movements easy to trace.

43:16.042 --> 43:19.510
He's significantly north of the
Arctic Circle in the summertime

43:19.512 --> 43:24.481
and then he moves south as
the weather gets colder.

43:24.483 --> 43:29.286
I'm still not seeing the evidence.
Where's the evidence?

43:29.288 --> 43:33.490
All right, all right,
let's start with Iqaluit.

43:33.492 --> 43:37.294
Since they began keeping records
in the early 20th century,

43:37.296 --> 43:41.198
they've recorded 112 homicides,
and 41 disappearances.

43:41.200 --> 43:43.934
Now, based on the population size,

43:43.936 --> 43:45.903
and the time span
of over 100 years,

43:45.905 --> 43:48.472
that's statistically
a little bit high.

43:48.474 --> 43:52.877
But it's not anything that you'd
find outside of a normal bell curve.

43:52.879 --> 43:57.081
However, when you look
at unexplained homicides

43:57.083 --> 43:59.984
and disappearances,
the number is 44.

43:59.986 --> 44:03.153
Of those 44 homicides
and disappearances,

44:03.155 --> 44:07.391
42 of them occurred
between April and May.

44:07.393 --> 44:10.394
Bear Lake, that's few
hundred miles to the south.

44:10.396 --> 44:12.930
Unexplained homicides
and disappearances, 20.

44:12.932 --> 44:16.166
Of those 17, between
February and March.

44:16.168 --> 44:19.069
Yellowknife. Unexplained homicides
and disappearances, 74.

44:19.071 --> 44:22.072
65 of them occurring between
December and February.

44:22.074 --> 44:23.274
You see what I'm saying.

44:23.276 --> 44:28.379
These statistical anomalies,
these spikes in murders,

44:28.381 --> 44:31.548
they follow a migratory pattern.

44:31.550 --> 44:35.119
They're moving as the
creature would move.

44:35.121 --> 44:39.556
So you're saying the thing
is a serial killer?

44:39.558 --> 44:41.191
Oh. No, no.

44:41.193 --> 44:44.161
If he was intent on killing humans

44:44.163 --> 44:47.231
the numbers would be astronomical.

44:47.233 --> 44:53.137
I think these attacks are a matter
of self-preservation, that's all.

44:53.405 --> 44:54.939
They're, um...

44:54.941 --> 44:59.643
They're the creature trying to protect
his anonymity, his territory.

44:59.645 --> 45:02.346
All right, all right, fuck this.
Sorry.

45:02.348 --> 45:03.714
What's wrong?

45:03.716 --> 45:05.983
This whole thing is fucked.

45:05.985 --> 45:08.118
Oh, okay, now you believe me.

45:08.120 --> 45:11.989
No, I still think your theory
is complete horseshit.

45:11.991 --> 45:14.058
This is not funny anymore.

45:14.060 --> 45:15.492
I think you knew what
you were getting into

45:15.494 --> 45:17.394
when you came in the
crew and signed up.

45:17.396 --> 45:19.296
Hey, you're overreacting.

45:19.298 --> 45:20.731
We're sitting right here.

45:20.733 --> 45:22.599
I'm not fucking doing this.
Are you kidding me?

45:22.601 --> 45:24.034
Excuse me.

45:24.036 --> 45:27.338
The last time I checked, I was
paying you, isn't that right?

45:27.340 --> 45:30.574
And I'm still paying you.
I'm paying you and you.

45:30.576 --> 45:32.443
Everybody here, I'm paying.

45:32.445 --> 45:35.446
So I say when somebody leaves
and somebody doesn't leave.

45:35.448 --> 45:37.314
It's me who's running this ship.

45:37.316 --> 45:40.150
And if I want advice from a
sound man, I will ask you.

45:40.152 --> 45:41.986
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

45:41.988 --> 45:44.722
Stop it! Enough. Enough.

45:44.724 --> 45:49.026
Brian! Good Lord!
You are both overreacting.

45:49.028 --> 45:50.627
Enough!

45:56.034 --> 45:57.768
Sorry.

46:00.305 --> 46:02.539
I'm sorry.

46:02.541 --> 46:03.640
Okay? I'm sorry.

46:03.642 --> 46:08.345
Jonathan, I didn't mean to
say your theory is bullshit.

46:08.347 --> 46:12.683
It's really scary, where we are.

46:12.685 --> 46:17.187
We are out by ourselves, this
is really not what I'm used to.

46:17.189 --> 46:20.124
So, I'm sorry.

46:20.126 --> 46:21.592
I'm sorry, too.

46:21.594 --> 46:25.729
Boys, why don't you
have a swig of this?

46:25.731 --> 46:28.232
You won't find this
in the lower 48.

46:34.205 --> 46:35.439
Can I have some?

46:35.441 --> 46:37.408
Thank you, Karl.

46:41.446 --> 46:44.681
No hard feelings. Jonathan?

46:44.683 --> 46:46.583
No hard feelings?

46:52.724 --> 46:56.093
Karl, what do you think
of Jonathan's theory,

46:56.095 --> 46:58.195
about the crime clusters?

47:00.632 --> 47:03.767
It makes sense.

47:03.769 --> 47:07.704
A predator after the caribou herd.

47:07.706 --> 47:12.376
Something that would also kill a
human if it happened upon one.

47:12.378 --> 47:15.579
Wow. So you believe him?

47:15.581 --> 47:18.315
Well, the theory is dead-on.
The culprit's wrong.

47:20.518 --> 47:22.319
What do you mean?

47:22.321 --> 47:24.855
He's mistaken
Frankenstein for a bear.

47:28.260 --> 47:30.094
They kill at least a
few people every year,

47:30.096 --> 47:32.830
probably more than
what gets reported.

47:32.832 --> 47:38.135
I guess that would explain all the
unsolved murders and disappearances.

47:39.337 --> 47:42.106
But I don't know, I ain't
done the research.

47:42.108 --> 47:44.708
And you seem like a smart guy.

47:44.710 --> 47:46.610
I bagged a lot of
big game in my day.

47:46.612 --> 47:49.513
I wouldn't mind bagging
myself a Frankenstein.

47:57.455 --> 47:59.256
God! Fuck.

47:59.258 --> 48:00.357
Fuck.

48:00.359 --> 48:01.792
Yeah.

48:01.794 --> 48:06.363
I'll tell you one thing, polar
bear, best damn hunter on Earth.

48:06.365 --> 48:11.635
Tigers and lions are just pussies
by comparison, literally.

48:11.637 --> 48:12.870
Figuratively.

48:12.872 --> 48:15.906
Polar bear can outrun a racehorse.

48:15.908 --> 48:19.243
Can swim in ice cold water
for 100 kilometers.

48:19.245 --> 48:22.346
Hold his breath underwater
for 15 minutes.

48:22.348 --> 48:23.514
You ever seen one?

48:23.516 --> 48:26.917
Hell, I've killed 12 of them.

48:26.919 --> 48:30.854
Friend of mine, I used to
hunt with, Ted Meachum.

48:30.856 --> 48:34.424
He survived a polar bear attack.

48:34.426 --> 48:37.761
He's north of Churchill,
that's in Manitoba.

48:37.763 --> 48:42.199
Took some weekend warriors
up on a hunt, 1992.

48:43.935 --> 48:46.503
I had a bad feeling about that.

48:46.505 --> 48:51.275
The winter was mild, ice didn't
freeze over till February.

48:51.277 --> 48:55.212
When it did, it was
only for a few weeks.

48:55.214 --> 48:59.650
The polar bears eat seals.

48:59.652 --> 49:03.520
When the Hudson isn't frozen
over, they can't hunt seals.

49:03.522 --> 49:08.592
When they can't hunt seals,
they hunt something else.

49:08.594 --> 49:11.695
Anyway, old Ted took 'em
out on a light plane.

49:11.697 --> 49:14.565
They had engine trouble,
had to put down.

49:14.567 --> 49:17.968
Six men stranded in the tundra.

49:17.970 --> 49:22.206
A big male polar bear
got the bead on them.

49:22.208 --> 49:23.874
Pulled one man out of the fuselage

49:23.876 --> 49:26.677
in the middle of the
night, screaming.

49:28.980 --> 49:31.982
Dragged another through the ice.

49:31.984 --> 49:34.952
Come daylight they
thought they were safe.

49:34.954 --> 49:38.222
Polar bears, like most
predators, prefer the ambush,

49:38.224 --> 49:40.224
not this one, he was different.

49:40.226 --> 49:42.659
He attacked that plane dead on.

49:42.661 --> 49:44.995
Ripped apart what was
left of the fuselage,

49:44.997 --> 49:48.398
killed all the
remaining passengers.

49:48.400 --> 49:50.934
All except Ted.

49:50.936 --> 49:53.971
What happened to Ted?

49:53.973 --> 49:56.707
That's the damnedest thing.

49:56.709 --> 50:00.510
He ripped off Ted's leg.
I mean, just ripped it off.

50:00.512 --> 50:04.748
Ate it in front of him.
But let him live.

50:04.750 --> 50:09.386
Like he was toying with him.

50:09.388 --> 50:11.822
Ted was supposed to
be gone overnight.

50:11.824 --> 50:16.627
So the following day I
led a search party.

50:16.629 --> 50:18.929
Got a sea plane.
Spotted the wreckage.

50:18.931 --> 50:22.766
Found Ted nearly bled to death.

50:22.768 --> 50:26.770
But he did a good job
with the tourniquet.

50:26.772 --> 50:30.507
I guess the bear did get
him in the end though.

50:30.509 --> 50:31.842
What do you mean?

50:31.844 --> 50:34.311
He was never right
after the attack.

50:34.313 --> 50:38.915
Six months later, he shot himself
in the head with his Winchester.

50:41.419 --> 50:43.053
That's fucked up.

50:43.055 --> 50:46.757
Yeah. Don't fuck with
the forces of nature.

50:48.826 --> 50:53.330
You better respect her, because
nature doesn't forgive.

50:57.869 --> 50:59.736
Are you fucking with us?

51:02.073 --> 51:04.708
Do I look like I'm
fucking with you?

51:10.548 --> 51:13.717
Whoa, easy, look.

51:15.887 --> 51:19.056
Hello. Hi, Eric.

51:19.058 --> 51:22.025
Kiss me, I want a kiss.
I want a kiss, Eric.

51:22.027 --> 51:23.994
Brian, that's disgusting.

51:26.497 --> 51:28.365
Let me see that.

51:36.574 --> 51:38.775
He's out there, you know.

51:38.777 --> 51:41.478
And tomorrow we'll
go looking for him.

51:41.480 --> 51:43.513
But right now, I'm turning in.

51:43.515 --> 51:44.981
Now, if those wolves start up,

51:44.983 --> 51:49.486
don't you go waking me up.
I'll make good on my promise.

51:49.488 --> 51:51.455
Okay.

52:15.646 --> 52:17.781
Those wolves are really
freaking me out.

52:17.783 --> 52:19.950
I know.

52:19.952 --> 52:21.485
They sound closer than last night.

52:21.487 --> 52:23.387
I know.

52:23.389 --> 52:25.689
Jesus Christ.

52:25.691 --> 52:28.959
Something's got them worked up.

52:28.961 --> 52:31.395
I don't know how he
sleeps through this.

52:31.397 --> 52:32.829
Karl?

52:32.831 --> 52:35.499
This is like a lullaby to him.

52:35.501 --> 52:37.968
Shh, shh! Listen.

52:39.771 --> 52:41.938
What?

52:41.940 --> 52:44.141
They just stopped.

52:47.512 --> 52:50.080
Maybe now we can get some sleep.

52:55.520 --> 52:57.087
What was that?

52:57.089 --> 52:58.989
Holy shit!

52:58.991 --> 53:00.190
Should we wake up Karl?

53:00.192 --> 53:04.594
No! We should... No. He'll kill me.

53:04.596 --> 53:06.129
I think that's him.

53:06.131 --> 53:08.098
What? Really? You think so?

53:08.100 --> 53:09.433
Yes.

53:09.435 --> 53:10.567
No way.

53:10.569 --> 53:13.837
Yes, I do. The wolves are scared
of him. That's why they stopped.

53:13.839 --> 53:15.672
It's a bear.

53:15.674 --> 53:16.907
I don't think so.

53:16.909 --> 53:18.875
Have you ever heard a
bear howl at night?

53:18.877 --> 53:20.577
Do you know what it sounds like?

53:20.579 --> 53:23.480
Do you know what it sounds like?

53:23.482 --> 53:26.516
No, but it probably
sounds like that.

53:26.518 --> 53:28.552
Yeah.

53:31.523 --> 53:33.890
That sound like a bear to you?

53:48.139 --> 53:50.841
Somebody stole one of our
snowmobiles last night

53:50.843 --> 53:53.477
and trashed the other one.

53:53.479 --> 53:54.945
The third one is still working.

53:54.947 --> 53:56.780
Oh, terrific.

53:56.782 --> 53:58.148
I thought we were alone out here.

53:58.150 --> 54:00.884
Well, we're obviously not.

54:00.886 --> 54:02.486
Who could have done this?

54:02.488 --> 54:04.254
Somebody was definitely here.

54:04.256 --> 54:06.723
Big fucker, too.

54:06.725 --> 54:09.226
Tracks lead over there.

54:09.228 --> 54:12.229
It's not a polar bear, or a
goddamn monster. It's a man.

54:14.732 --> 54:16.800
Hey, where are you going?

54:16.802 --> 54:18.568
In 30 minutes, I'll have his ass.

54:18.570 --> 54:22.706
He didn't take any fuel, and
those snowmobiles were low...

54:22.708 --> 54:24.708
I don't think you
should go out there.

54:24.710 --> 54:25.942
What did you say?

54:25.944 --> 54:29.246
I said, I don't think you
should go out there.

54:29.248 --> 54:32.582
Are you fucking kidding me?

54:32.584 --> 54:34.117
Karl, I just think it's a bad idea.

54:34.119 --> 54:36.253
Hey!

54:36.255 --> 54:39.055
We got a crisis on
our hands right now.

54:39.057 --> 54:42.826
I need you guys to do
exactly what I say.

54:42.828 --> 54:44.728
No need to panic.
I'll be back soon.

54:44.730 --> 54:46.863
I understand, I don't think
you should go out there.

54:46.865 --> 54:48.832
This is my country!

54:48.834 --> 54:50.133
I'll be goddamned

54:50.135 --> 54:53.803
if I let some motherfucker come
in here and steal my stuff.

54:53.805 --> 54:55.205
All right?

54:58.943 --> 55:00.944
You don't want to take
the other snowmobile?

55:00.946 --> 55:03.980
And let him know I'm coming?
You fucking nuts?

55:15.092 --> 55:18.895
It's been four hours since Karl left
and there's been no sign of him.

55:18.897 --> 55:20.330
So I'm officially worried.

55:20.332 --> 55:22.699
Brian and Eric have volunteered
to go looking for him,

55:22.701 --> 55:24.134
while the rest of us
stay at the camp.

55:24.136 --> 55:25.602
I drive this time.
You film.

55:25.604 --> 55:27.604
You drive like a grandma.

55:31.142 --> 55:34.311
Great fucking trip, Vicky.

55:34.313 --> 55:36.012
We don't make it back,

55:36.014 --> 55:41.017
I want to officially go on tape
as saying this country sucks

55:41.019 --> 55:43.887
and it can lick my balls.

55:43.889 --> 55:47.591
USA rules! Canada can lick 'em.

55:47.593 --> 55:51.161
Just come back in an hour
whether you find Karl or not.

55:51.163 --> 55:53.830
One hour, otherwise
I start to freak out.

55:53.832 --> 55:55.865
An hour, got it. You ready?

55:55.867 --> 55:57.834
I'm ready.

55:57.836 --> 56:02.238
Bye! Love you! Kisses!

56:12.985 --> 56:14.784
I guess we wait.

56:29.934 --> 56:33.069
Hey, Eric!

56:33.071 --> 56:35.639
What?

56:35.641 --> 56:37.741
I have to get my gloves straight.

56:37.743 --> 56:39.342
Oh, my God! Oh!

56:39.344 --> 56:41.311
This whole thing
is so fucked, dude.

56:41.313 --> 56:42.412
I know.

56:42.414 --> 56:44.648
What are we doing?

56:44.650 --> 56:47.050
You don't believe
this shit, do you?

56:47.052 --> 56:48.785
Fuck no!

56:48.787 --> 56:53.123
But I mean...
It's weird shit going on.

56:53.125 --> 56:54.724
Why, you don't believe it, do you?

56:54.726 --> 56:58.294
No. No. It's a mind fuck though.

56:58.296 --> 57:02.432
I mean, the noises last night?
And the drawing?

57:02.434 --> 57:03.933
Freaky shit, right?

57:03.935 --> 57:07.303
Yeah. But no,
Frankenstein is fiction.

57:07.305 --> 57:10.407
And Jonathan, for a genius,
is a fucking idiot.

57:10.409 --> 57:12.042
Amen to that.

57:20.084 --> 57:22.018
They're gonna be fine, right?

57:22.020 --> 57:25.088
I think so.

57:25.090 --> 57:27.357
Yeah.

57:27.359 --> 57:28.992
I wouldn't be worried about them.

57:28.994 --> 57:33.029
Really, it's broad daylight.

57:33.031 --> 57:36.833
I'm pretty sure the creature has
developed a nocturnal way of life.

57:36.835 --> 57:38.835
He shies away from people.

57:38.837 --> 57:41.805
He's generally moving at
night, sleeps during the day.

57:41.807 --> 57:43.840
They're fine.

57:43.842 --> 57:47.811
Aren't you concerned at all
if he were to come here?

57:47.813 --> 57:51.448
No. Of course not. How could I be?

57:51.450 --> 57:53.717
That's been my goal
the entire time.

57:53.719 --> 57:56.286
I've been clear about
that, haven't I?

57:56.288 --> 58:00.257
I want this. I need this proof.

58:00.759 --> 58:03.860
I'm getting kicked out
of the university.

58:03.862 --> 58:05.128
Anne told me.

58:05.130 --> 58:06.996
She did?

58:08.232 --> 58:10.967
Then you understand
how much I need it.

58:10.969 --> 58:14.871
Everything I've been working
on hinges on meeting him.

58:14.873 --> 58:19.776
That's the whole point of this, is
to have real photographic evidence.

58:19.778 --> 58:24.414
It's the only way I'm ever gonna prove to
my colleagues, to the world that I'm right.

58:24.516 --> 58:26.752
And I know I am.

58:28.754 --> 58:30.954
No doubt in my mind that I'm right.

58:59.083 --> 59:01.951
Fuck me!

59:01.953 --> 59:03.319
I don't want to go in there.

59:03.321 --> 59:05.088
You think I do?

59:05.090 --> 59:10.360
You think I want some bear to make
fun of me while he eats my leg?

59:10.362 --> 59:11.461
Karl!

59:11.463 --> 59:14.197
Yo, Karl!

59:14.199 --> 59:17.133
Shit!

59:17.135 --> 59:19.035
We gotta go in there.

59:48.065 --> 59:49.966
Karl?

59:53.470 --> 59:55.038
I don't like this place.

59:55.040 --> 59:56.906
I don't either.

01:00:04.849 --> 01:00:06.015
Oh!

01:00:06.017 --> 01:00:07.851
What?

01:00:07.853 --> 01:00:08.952
There's blood.

01:00:08.954 --> 01:00:10.086
What?

01:00:10.088 --> 01:00:12.255
Over here.

01:00:55.032 --> 01:00:56.900
Oh, Jesus!

01:00:57.502 --> 01:00:59.636
Holy shit!

01:00:59.638 --> 01:01:01.004
There's somebody out here with us.

01:01:01.006 --> 01:01:03.306
We have to get the
fuck out of here.

01:01:03.308 --> 01:01:05.541
Let's get the fuck out of here.
Right now, we got to go.

01:01:05.543 --> 01:01:10.079
Go get the fuck out of here!
What the fuck is happening?

01:01:14.118 --> 01:01:15.451
Hey, what's up?

01:01:15.453 --> 01:01:17.320
He's dead. Karl is dead!
What?

01:01:17.322 --> 01:01:18.688
No. What're you talking about?

01:01:18.690 --> 01:01:21.257
It's your fault, you motherfucker!
No! Stop!

01:01:21.259 --> 01:01:23.493
Hey!

01:01:23.495 --> 01:01:27.563
The one guy who knows how
to survive out here is dead.

01:01:27.565 --> 01:01:29.165
It's your fault!

01:01:29.167 --> 01:01:31.367
I tried to tell him.

01:01:31.369 --> 01:01:32.435
What happened?

01:01:32.437 --> 01:01:34.003
We are fucked!

01:01:34.005 --> 01:01:35.471
We tracked him into the forest.

01:01:35.473 --> 01:01:38.408
There was a goddamn
bloody dead Karl.

01:01:38.410 --> 01:01:40.076
His gun was smashed next to him.

01:01:40.078 --> 01:01:42.078
His gun?

01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:44.080
Fucking gun.
The Creature felt threatened.

01:01:44.082 --> 01:01:45.381
I tried to stop...

01:01:45.383 --> 01:01:46.516
What fucking creature...

01:01:46.518 --> 01:01:49.152
There's some crazy person
in the forest killing people.

01:01:49.154 --> 01:01:52.055
And you're talking about
Frankenstein, you psycho!

01:01:52.057 --> 01:01:56.025
What's it gonna take for you to believe me?
I don't care who it is! All right!

01:01:56.027 --> 01:01:59.729
No! No! No! We are getting out
of here as quickly as possible.

01:01:59.731 --> 01:02:01.664
I'm not going anywhere.

01:02:01.666 --> 01:02:03.566
I'm not going anywhere.

01:02:03.568 --> 01:02:04.701
Seriously?

01:02:04.703 --> 01:02:08.137
I'm on the verge of a great
scientific discovery.

01:02:08.139 --> 01:02:10.740
I'm not going anywhere!

01:02:10.742 --> 01:02:12.208
Are you kidding me?

01:02:12.210 --> 01:02:15.445
Karl is dead!
Something is out there.

01:02:15.447 --> 01:02:17.480
They're right, they're
right, Jonathan.

01:02:17.482 --> 01:02:21.117
I know this is important to
you, but we have got to go.

01:02:21.119 --> 01:02:24.220
There's a man dead,
for Christ's sake!

01:02:24.222 --> 01:02:27.557
Come on, we have to go now!

01:02:30.461 --> 01:02:31.594
Let him stay here.

01:02:31.596 --> 01:02:33.629
Get your stuff.

01:02:51.648 --> 01:02:53.349
What?

01:02:53.351 --> 01:02:55.685
Go ahead.

01:02:57.554 --> 01:02:59.389
Go.

01:03:08.232 --> 01:03:11.434
With one remaining vehicle,
we can't travel as a group.

01:03:11.436 --> 01:03:14.670
So Luke is going to go for help.

01:03:14.672 --> 01:03:16.672
All right, bro.

01:03:16.674 --> 01:03:18.674
Be careful.

01:03:22.079 --> 01:03:25.081
The plan is that Luke is gonna

01:03:25.083 --> 01:03:28.618
try to find the highway
and flag down help.

01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:30.586
Be safe, Luke.

01:03:30.588 --> 01:03:32.155
Bye.

01:03:44.368 --> 01:03:45.768
It'll be okay.

01:03:45.770 --> 01:03:49.205
He has a great sense of direction.

01:04:05.255 --> 01:04:08.658
It's our second night at the yurt.

01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:12.695
Luke left yesterday and we
don't know where he is.

01:04:12.697 --> 01:04:15.798
We have no transportation.

01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:21.237
To be honest, I'm not even sure how to
get back to the road, at this point.

01:04:21.239 --> 01:04:24.107
And, as you can hear, there's
a storm blowing outside.

01:04:24.109 --> 01:04:26.309
Though I think that

01:04:26.311 --> 01:04:31.147
even if we knew the direction,
we couldn't get to the road.

01:04:33.317 --> 01:04:36.119
Obviously, our cell phones
don't work out here.

01:04:39.890 --> 01:04:43.159
And most concerning, Karl is dead.

01:04:47.297 --> 01:04:50.500
And we're not exactly sure how,
but something is out there.

01:04:55.506 --> 01:05:00.409
Just suppose for a second
it is the monster.

01:05:00.411 --> 01:05:01.577
Then what?

01:05:01.579 --> 01:05:04.347
It is him.

01:05:04.349 --> 01:05:07.884
I promise you, it's him.

01:05:07.886 --> 01:05:12.555
And the only chance we have is

01:05:12.557 --> 01:05:16.926
to appeal to its humanity.

01:05:16.928 --> 01:05:19.295
What humanity?

01:05:19.297 --> 01:05:21.631
It's capable of reason,

01:05:25.669 --> 01:05:28.204
he's not some mindless animal.

01:05:28.206 --> 01:05:32.808
It reacts to fear and anger.

01:05:32.810 --> 01:05:36.546
I mean, this is
something that's been

01:05:36.548 --> 01:05:40.816
searching for companionship its
whole life. It's been rejected.

01:05:40.818 --> 01:05:44.187
He is intelligent,

01:05:45.756 --> 01:05:49.525
it will respond to a
sympathetic hand.

01:05:49.527 --> 01:05:53.529
How? How do you know that?

01:05:55.332 --> 01:05:59.835
You're just gonna have to trust me.

01:05:59.837 --> 01:06:03.706
I don't understand how anybody
could survive out there.

01:06:03.708 --> 01:06:06.409
It's so cold.

01:06:06.411 --> 01:06:08.277
Hopefully Luke will make it back.

01:06:08.279 --> 01:06:11.280
And we can expect a
rescue party tomorrow.

01:06:11.282 --> 01:06:13.883
Regardless, the equipment was
rented out for five days.

01:06:13.885 --> 01:06:17.587
So if we're not back in two days
they'll report us as missing.

01:06:17.589 --> 01:06:19.956
They have a general
idea of where we are.

01:06:25.363 --> 01:06:28.431
What?

01:06:28.433 --> 01:06:31.867
I forgot to pay my rent.

01:06:31.869 --> 01:06:35.638
Jesus!

01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:39.375
Andrew's gonna have to cover me.

01:06:39.377 --> 01:06:41.544
He's gonna kill me.

01:06:47.284 --> 01:06:50.653
I can't stand it, man.
I got to get out of here.

01:06:50.655 --> 01:06:52.955
Jesus! Oh, God!

01:06:52.957 --> 01:06:54.357
I can't see anything.

01:06:54.359 --> 01:06:55.759
How do you turn on
the night vision?

01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:57.827
I don't know. It's Luke's camera.

01:06:59.664 --> 01:07:02.531
Oh, God, he's getting closer.

01:07:02.533 --> 01:07:05.434
I got to get out of here.
I got to get out of here.

01:07:09.574 --> 01:07:11.874
Oh, I got it.

01:07:14.344 --> 01:07:18.281
Fuck, I can't take this.

01:07:18.283 --> 01:07:20.616
It's okay.

01:07:20.618 --> 01:07:22.051
Its going to be okay, right?

01:07:22.053 --> 01:07:24.553
Yes, its fine, don't move.

01:07:24.555 --> 01:07:28.858
He didn't attack last night.
He's not going to do anything.

01:07:28.860 --> 01:07:29.992
Why's he doing that?

01:07:29.994 --> 01:07:31.494
I don't know.

01:07:33.364 --> 01:07:35.931
I think he's...

01:07:35.933 --> 01:07:39.335
I think he's warning us.
He wants us to leave.

01:07:39.337 --> 01:07:41.470
I want us to leave, too.

01:07:41.472 --> 01:07:42.972
I know.

01:07:45.410 --> 01:07:47.643
Just...

01:07:47.645 --> 01:07:50.413
We'll be fine.
Go back to sleep.

01:08:21.511 --> 01:08:23.979
Okay, I think we're recording.

01:08:23.981 --> 01:08:29.085
We're following Luke's tracks.

01:08:29.087 --> 01:08:31.053
We haven't seen him since...

01:08:31.055 --> 01:08:32.755
Since he left yesterday.

01:08:32.756 --> 01:08:35.057
We've been walking...

01:08:35.059 --> 01:08:38.993
I don't know how long.

01:08:38.996 --> 01:08:42.131
We don't know if Luke made it back.

01:08:42.133 --> 01:08:44.466
So, we're just...

01:08:44.469 --> 01:08:46.702
Hope we find him.

01:09:10.761 --> 01:09:13.662
Stop, stop, stop. What is that?

01:09:13.663 --> 01:09:14.764
Where? I don't see it.

01:09:14.765 --> 01:09:16.098
Over there.

01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:17.899
Brian, are you getting it?

01:09:17.902 --> 01:09:19.602
Brian, you see that?

01:09:19.604 --> 01:09:21.804
Over there. I don't know.
It could be the snowmobile.

01:09:21.805 --> 01:09:22.971
Okay.

01:09:22.974 --> 01:09:24.073
Do you see anything?

01:09:24.075 --> 01:09:25.408
Luke?

01:09:25.410 --> 01:09:28.411
There's something behind the tree.
The one right by the line.

01:09:28.412 --> 01:09:31.147
Luke!

01:09:31.149 --> 01:09:34.116
Luke!

01:09:34.118 --> 01:09:36.786
What the fuck?

01:09:36.787 --> 01:09:37.920
Do you see him?

01:09:37.921 --> 01:09:39.087
Where is he?

01:09:39.090 --> 01:09:40.689
His helmet's here.

01:09:40.691 --> 01:09:41.791
Where is he?

01:09:41.792 --> 01:09:45.161
There's no key! Luke!

01:09:45.162 --> 01:09:47.529
Are those tracks? What the fuck?

01:09:47.532 --> 01:09:50.966
All right, let's do a sweep.

01:09:50.968 --> 01:09:53.435
He can't be far from here...

01:09:53.438 --> 01:09:57.873
Split up, but stay in each
other's line of sight.

01:09:57.875 --> 01:09:59.475
All right?

01:09:59.477 --> 01:10:01.043
You want us to go by ourselves?

01:10:01.045 --> 01:10:02.878
Brian, cut the bullshit!

01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:05.214
I've had enough of it.
There's four of us.

01:10:05.216 --> 01:10:07.650
Let's just look for him,
he's got to be around here.

01:10:07.652 --> 01:10:09.051
Everyone got that?

01:10:09.053 --> 01:10:11.020
Keep each other in
your sights, got it?

01:10:11.022 --> 01:10:12.188
Got it!

01:10:12.190 --> 01:10:14.824
Luke!

01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:18.494
Luke!

01:10:19.563 --> 01:10:22.131
Luke!

01:10:45.222 --> 01:10:47.656
Luke!

01:10:49.593 --> 01:10:51.627
Luke!

01:11:01.639 --> 01:11:03.672
Fuck!

01:11:07.544 --> 01:11:10.579
Jesus!

01:11:10.581 --> 01:11:12.848
Luke!

01:11:12.850 --> 01:11:14.783
Fuck me!

01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:18.587
Luke!

01:11:19.823 --> 01:11:21.991
Fuck...

01:11:23.793 --> 01:11:25.294
Luke!

01:11:26.930 --> 01:11:28.564
Buddy!

01:11:28.566 --> 01:11:30.533
Luke! Guys!

01:11:30.535 --> 01:11:33.235
Luke! Guys! Luke!

01:11:33.237 --> 01:11:36.205
Luke. Luke...

01:11:36.207 --> 01:11:38.874
No, no, no, no, no!

01:12:05.068 --> 01:12:06.702
The camera's over here.

01:12:06.704 --> 01:12:08.137
What? Where is he?

01:12:08.139 --> 01:12:10.239
No! Brian!

01:12:10.241 --> 01:12:12.808
There's some blood over here.

01:12:12.810 --> 01:12:14.143
What do you mean?

01:12:14.145 --> 01:12:16.245
Oh, Christ! No.

01:12:16.247 --> 01:12:17.947
Oh, my God!

01:12:17.949 --> 01:12:21.250
Oh, God! Dammit.

01:12:21.252 --> 01:12:23.018
What are you looking at?
What is it?

01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:25.287
It's a footprint. He was here.

01:12:25.289 --> 01:12:27.723
He was definitely here.
Look at this.

01:12:27.725 --> 01:12:28.857
Oh, my God!

01:12:28.859 --> 01:12:30.926
Look at the space
between foot falls.

01:12:30.928 --> 01:12:32.595
It's amazing.

01:12:32.597 --> 01:12:33.896
Amazing?

01:12:33.898 --> 01:12:36.599
What's amazing is that
we are in serious danger.

01:12:36.601 --> 01:12:37.800
All right?

01:12:37.802 --> 01:12:38.934
That thing took Brian.

01:12:38.936 --> 01:12:41.270
Yes, I know that. I know that.

01:12:41.272 --> 01:12:44.607
You don't think I know that?

01:12:44.609 --> 01:12:48.777
All right, listen. We go
back to the yurt right away.

01:12:48.779 --> 01:12:50.179
We don't wait.

01:12:50.181 --> 01:12:53.148
We go back and wait for help.

01:12:53.150 --> 01:12:55.618
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:12:57.187 --> 01:13:00.289
What's wrong with me?

01:13:00.291 --> 01:13:03.826
I'm sorry, but Brian is
almost certainly dead.

01:13:03.828 --> 01:13:05.761
Brian is dead.

01:13:05.763 --> 01:13:08.397
If we don't leave right
now, we're dead, too.

01:13:10.967 --> 01:13:13.002
What do you want to do?
Go after this?

01:13:13.004 --> 01:13:15.704
No, we go to the yurt now!

01:13:15.706 --> 01:13:16.972
We wait for help.

01:13:16.974 --> 01:13:19.108
Or we wait for him to come to us.

01:13:24.314 --> 01:13:26.415
Can you zoom in some more?

01:13:26.417 --> 01:13:29.051
This is as close as I can go.

01:13:29.053 --> 01:13:30.152
The door is open.

01:13:30.154 --> 01:13:31.286
That's not good.

01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:34.890
Jesus Christ!

01:13:36.893 --> 01:13:40.062
He's in there.

01:13:41.732 --> 01:13:46.201
What the fuck do we do?

01:13:46.203 --> 01:13:50.239
Well, he's...

01:13:50.241 --> 01:13:51.907
He's clearly agitated.

01:13:51.909 --> 01:13:53.876
You think?

01:13:53.878 --> 01:13:56.278
I don't think...

01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:58.781
I don't think we can
approach him right now.

01:13:58.783 --> 01:14:02.951
I think it's a very bad idea.

01:14:02.953 --> 01:14:05.320
We gotta do something.
It'll be night soon.

01:14:05.322 --> 01:14:07.356
We can't stay out here.
We'll freeze to death.

01:14:07.358 --> 01:14:09.992
Yeah, I know that.

01:14:09.994 --> 01:14:12.961
Yeah, so get down there
and talk to him.

01:14:12.963 --> 01:14:14.830
That's why we're here, right?

01:14:14.832 --> 01:14:16.098
You're the expert.

01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:18.467
You're to appeal to his humanity.

01:14:18.469 --> 01:14:21.937
Not now. He's too worked up.

01:14:25.108 --> 01:14:27.142
We have to do something.

01:14:27.144 --> 01:14:30.779
Okay. We wait.

01:14:30.781 --> 01:14:34.416
Let's give him some time.

01:14:36.086 --> 01:14:38.187
Either,

01:14:39.789 --> 01:14:42.191
he will leave, or calm down.

01:14:56.440 --> 01:15:00.142
How much longer can
he go on like this?

01:15:03.114 --> 01:15:06.081
I'm freezing.
I can't feel my hands.

01:15:06.083 --> 01:15:08.450
Here give me the camera.

01:15:10.453 --> 01:15:11.820
You all right?

01:15:11.822 --> 01:15:13.922
Yeah, yeah.

01:15:21.832 --> 01:15:23.966
Oh, my God!

01:15:26.936 --> 01:15:29.104
That's him isn't it?

01:15:32.408 --> 01:15:35.844
Here's what we're
gonna do. I'm gonna...

01:15:35.846 --> 01:15:39.148
I'm going to call to him.

01:15:39.150 --> 01:15:43.486
Once he comes out, he'll come to
me, I'll separate myself from you.

01:15:43.988 --> 01:15:47.456
Use the night vision to find
your way back to the yurt.

01:15:47.458 --> 01:15:49.491
Okay?

01:15:49.493 --> 01:15:52.361
What about you?

01:15:52.363 --> 01:15:54.263
I don't know.

01:15:54.265 --> 01:15:56.298
Hopefully I can reason with him.

01:16:03.907 --> 01:16:06.141
He went back inside, okay?

01:16:13.483 --> 01:16:15.984
Jesus, it's cold.

01:16:15.986 --> 01:16:17.953
We've got to go now.

01:16:17.955 --> 01:16:20.088
You guys ready?

01:16:20.090 --> 01:16:22.491
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:16:44.414 --> 01:16:47.249
I start moving, you
head towards the yurt.

01:16:47.251 --> 01:16:50.085
You go quickly, but you walk.

01:16:50.087 --> 01:16:52.120
You don't run.

01:16:52.122 --> 01:16:55.357
If he heads towards you,

01:16:55.359 --> 01:16:57.926
try to stay calm.

01:16:57.928 --> 01:16:59.995
Don't run!

01:16:59.997 --> 01:17:02.531
Don't run!

01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:06.001
Oh, God!

01:17:14.944 --> 01:17:19.014
Hello, I'm right here.

01:17:19.016 --> 01:17:21.149
I'm right here.

01:17:21.151 --> 01:17:23.385
I don't want to hurt you.

01:17:23.387 --> 01:17:26.588
I'm a friend.

01:17:26.590 --> 01:17:29.892
I don't wanna hurt you.

01:17:29.894 --> 01:17:33.161
A friend, I don't want to hurt you!

01:17:33.163 --> 01:17:36.565
Hello?

01:17:36.567 --> 01:17:39.034
Okay, okay, you ready to go?

01:17:39.036 --> 01:17:40.235
Yeah, I can't.

01:17:40.237 --> 01:17:41.503
Hello!

01:17:41.505 --> 01:17:45.607
No, Eric, come on!
Eric, we've got to go, now!

01:17:52.548 --> 01:17:54.449
Go!

01:18:09.066 --> 01:18:10.265
Oh, my God!

01:18:10.267 --> 01:18:11.500
Don't stop!

01:18:15.639 --> 01:18:17.673
Vicky!

01:18:25.715 --> 01:18:28.250
Think, think, think, think!

01:18:30.521 --> 01:18:34.389
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

01:18:58.548 --> 01:19:00.615
Oh, my God!

01:19:00.617 --> 01:19:02.217
Jonathan!

01:19:38.455 --> 01:19:40.489
It's me, it's me!

01:19:40.491 --> 01:19:43.392
Oh, God! Oh, God! Jonathan!

01:19:43.394 --> 01:19:46.228
I need you to be quiet now.

01:19:48.398 --> 01:19:51.366
You gotta be very, very quiet.

01:20:04.147 --> 01:20:06.148
That's good. That's good.
Keep moving.

01:20:06.150 --> 01:20:07.249
Keep going.

01:20:07.251 --> 01:20:08.450
Okay.

01:20:08.452 --> 01:20:13.055
Don't run. Don't run!

01:20:13.057 --> 01:20:17.492
Straight ahead. That's very
good. That's very good.

01:20:17.494 --> 01:20:18.827
Shh, shh!

01:20:18.829 --> 01:20:20.729
Keep going, keep going.

01:20:20.731 --> 01:20:23.398
It's straight ahead.
Right in front of me.

01:20:25.635 --> 01:20:28.837
That's good. That's good.

01:20:28.839 --> 01:20:31.173
Get inside.

01:20:48.257 --> 01:20:49.691
I want you to stay here.

01:20:49.693 --> 01:20:53.595
I'm gonna go outside.
I'll be right back.

01:20:53.597 --> 01:20:58.366
But I need you to be very quiet.
Don't make a sound.

01:21:03.573 --> 01:21:06.374
I don't want to hurt you.

01:21:06.376 --> 01:21:08.310
I don't want to hurt you.

01:21:08.312 --> 01:21:10.479
I am not your enemy,
do you understand?

01:21:10.481 --> 01:21:12.848
My name is Venkenheim.

01:21:12.850 --> 01:21:15.150
Yes, Venkenheim.

01:21:15.152 --> 01:21:19.121
Like your creator,
like your father.

01:21:19.123 --> 01:21:23.358
I understand your pain...

01:21:25.261 --> 01:21:27.395
Let me help you.

01:21:27.397 --> 01:21:29.698
Let me help you.

01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:32.901
I've spent my whole
life searching for you.

01:21:32.903 --> 01:21:36.771
You are a miracle...

01:21:36.773 --> 01:21:41.643
Don't you understand?
I can see it in your eyes!

01:21:41.645 --> 01:21:44.179
You're not an animal.

01:21:44.181 --> 01:21:47.149
You're not an animal.
Let me touch you.

01:21:47.151 --> 01:21:48.316
You're a miracle.

01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:51.419
I don't want to hurt you.

01:21:52.523 --> 01:21:53.889
I just want to touch your hand.

01:22:07.904 --> 01:22:11.173
Oh, God! Oh, God!

01:22:54.217 --> 01:22:55.850
No! No!

01:23:35.524 --> 01:23:40.462
<i>If you miss the train I'm on</i>

01:23:40.464 --> 01:23:45.367
<i>You will know that I am gone</i>

01:23:45.369 --> 01:23:49.604
<i>You can hear the whistle blow</i>

01:23:49.606 --> 01:23:54.809
<i>A hundred miles</i>

01:23:54.811 --> 01:23:59.648
<i>A hundred miles, a hundred miles</i>

01:23:59.650 --> 01:24:04.753
<i>A hundred miles, a hundred miles</i>

01:24:04.755 --> 01:24:09.357
<i>You can hear the whistle blow</i>

01:24:09.359 --> 01:24:13.795
<i>A hundred miles</i>

<i>Lord I'm one, Lord I'm two</i>

01:24:19.069 --> 01:24:24.005
<i>Lord I'm three, Lord I'm four</i>

01:24:24.007 --> 01:24:28.510
<i>Lord I'm 500 miles</i>

01:24:28.512 --> 01:24:33.848

<i>All these years
and all these roads</i>

01:24:58.675 --> 01:25:03.611
<i>Never led me back to you</i>

01:25:03.613 --> 01:25:07.782
<i>I'm always 500 miles</i>

01:25:07.784 --> 01:25:12.887
