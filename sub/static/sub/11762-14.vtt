WEBVTT

00:01.272 --> 00:03.274
YOU KNOW, I'M ACTUALLY
FEELING A LITTLE GUILTY

00:03.274 --> 00:05.336
BECAUSE LAST NIGHT
YOU LEFT YOUR PURSE HERE,

00:05.336 --> 00:08.039
AND THEN WHEN THE PIZZA MAN
I CAME, I WAS $2 SHORT,

00:08.039 --> 00:10.141
SO I TOOK IT FROM YOU.
2 BUCKS. BIG DEAL.

00:10.141 --> 00:12.483
I ALSO TOOK A PACK OF GUM,
A LIPSTICK

00:12.483 --> 00:15.516
AND, UH, 28 OTHER DOLLARS.
I WAS GOING OUT TO GET WINE.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.748
YOU STOLE FROM ME
TO SUPPORT A DRINKING HABIT?

00:17.748 --> 00:19.750
I AM SO PROUD OF YOU.

00:19.750 --> 00:22.193
WELL,
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE.
(door closes)

00:22.193 --> 00:26.597
NO. PLEASE TELL ME YOU DID NOT
WEAR THAT T-SHIRT OUT.

00:26.597 --> 00:29.560
YOU'RE WELCOME.
ANDY, I'M SURE THAT YOU HEARD
THAT LAST WEEK

00:29.560 --> 00:33.134
BOBBY AND I KIND OF RECONNECTED
IN A... PHYSICAL WAY,

00:33.134 --> 00:35.666
AND THEN I REALIZED
IT WAS A MISTAKE.

00:35.666 --> 00:38.509
YOU HIT IT AND QUIT IT.
THAT'S HOW I DO.

00:38.509 --> 00:41.572
ANYWAY, COULD YOU GO CHECK
ON HIM AND MAKE SURE HE'S OKAY?

00:41.572 --> 00:44.345
NO PROBLEM. IT'S NOT LIKE I HAVE
TO SPEND ANY TIME AT THE GYM.

00:44.345 --> 00:46.817
(grunts)

00:46.817 --> 00:49.450
NO.

00:49.450 --> 00:51.182
(indistinct conversations)

00:51.182 --> 00:54.525
DON'T LOOK AT ME. I JUST CAN'T
TAKE SEEING YOU RIGHT NOW.

00:54.525 --> 00:57.188
THEN IT MAKES TOTAL SENSE
TO COME TO THE BAR I OWN.

00:57.188 --> 00:59.530
(lowered voice)
I FEEL SO GUILTY

00:59.530 --> 01:02.263
ABOUT SLEEPING WITH YOU
AND NOT TELLING JULES.

01:02.263 --> 01:04.265
I KNOW.
I WISH I HAD A TIME MACHINE

01:04.265 --> 01:06.267
SO I COULD GO BACK
AND UNDO...

01:06.267 --> 01:08.439
YOU KNOW, YOU.

01:08.439 --> 01:10.771
I WOULD ALSO USE IT
TO GO BACK

01:10.771 --> 01:13.774
AND TELL MY COUSIN NOT TO GIVE
HER DAUGHTER UP FOR ADOPTION.

01:13.774 --> 01:17.108
WE'RE PRETTY SURE
SHE'S DAKOTA FANNING NOW.
YEAH, SHE'S NOT ADOPTED.

01:17.108 --> 01:19.610
HMM.
HEY.
HAVE YOU GUYS SEEN BOBBY?

01:19.610 --> 01:22.153
HE'S NOT ON HIS BOAT
OR THE GOLF COURSE

01:22.153 --> 01:25.816
OR BY THAT UNDERPASS WHERE
HE BUYS FISH AND SPORTS COATS.
OH, YOU MUST HAVE
JUST MISSED HIM THERE.

01:25.816 --> 01:29.560
(laughs) HEY, LITTLE BUDDY.
YOU LIKE? 4 BUCKS.

01:31.222 --> 01:34.165
DO YOU KNOW HOW I LIKE
EVERYTHING TO BE ABOUT ME?

01:34.165 --> 01:38.229
I'VE MET YOU, SO, UH-HUH.
AND I JUST FEEL LIKE YOU AND I
HAVEN'T HAD AN ELLIE DAY

01:38.229 --> 01:41.101
IN SUCH A LONG TIME, YOU KNOW,
WHERE WE FOCUS ON MY NEEDS,

01:41.101 --> 01:43.504
YOU KNOW, I TALK,
YOU LISTEN, YOU TALK

01:43.504 --> 01:47.678
AND I THINK OF WHAT I'M
GONNA SAY NEXT? LIKE THAT.
I REALLY LIKE THOSE DAYS.
I-I FEEL LIKE A BUTLER.

01:47.678 --> 01:51.242
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
YOU COULD TAKE ME SHOPPING
AT AGE-INAPPROPRIATE STORES,

01:51.242 --> 01:53.244
AND THEN WE COULD COME BACK

01:53.244 --> 01:55.286
AND DRINK THAT $28 BOTTLE
OF WINE THAT YOU BOUGHT.

01:55.286 --> 01:57.848
IT WAS REALLY
2 $14 BOTTLES OF WINE,

01:57.848 --> 02:01.152
AND, UH, THEY'RE GONE.
(chuckles)

02:01.152 --> 02:03.524
ARE YOU STILL PROUD OF ME?

02:03.524 --> 02:06.157
MAYBE EVEN MORE SO,
SWEETIE.

02:06.157 --> 02:08.899
I HEARD ABOUT JULES, MAN.
YOU OKAY?

02:08.899 --> 02:10.601
I WON'T LIE.
MM.

02:10.601 --> 02:12.903
HER TELLING ME THAT
IT'S DEFINITELY REALLY OVER,

02:12.903 --> 02:15.766
YOU KNOW, IT STUNG A BIT.
SORRY, MAN.

02:15.766 --> 02:18.339
IT'S OKAY. I'VE MOVED ON.

02:18.339 --> 02:19.870
NOW I'M CELEBRATING

02:19.870 --> 02:21.872
WITH A PARKING LOT BOOZE CRUISE
ON THE BOAT.

02:21.872 --> 02:24.675
I JUST NEED GREY POUPON
OVER HERE TO GET OUT HIS WALLET

02:24.675 --> 02:27.678
AND LOAN ME THREE KEGS.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST BUY
A FEW CASES OF BEER?

02:27.678 --> 02:30.481
BECAUSE THEN THERE WOULDN'T BE
ANY SEXY KEG-PUMPING BANTER.

02:30.481 --> 02:32.223
HEY, BABY.

02:32.223 --> 02:34.154
(high-pitched voice)
YOU'RE REALLY GOOD AT THAT.

02:34.154 --> 02:37.488
YOU WANT ME TO KEEP PUMPIN'?
NEVER STOP PUMPING.

02:37.488 --> 02:40.391
A WHOLE NEW LEVEL
OF DISTURBING.

02:40.391 --> 02:43.334
WHO'S YOUR FRIEND?
HE'S HANDSOME. (giggles)

02:43.334 --> 02:46.237
GIVE IT UP. (laughs)

02:46.237 --> 02:49.370
WELL, HELLO, SIR.

02:49.370 --> 02:50.871
OH, THAT'S ALEX,

02:50.871 --> 02:52.873
MY TENNIS TEACHER/
FAKE BOYFRIEND.

02:52.873 --> 02:55.276
I'VE BEEN FAKE SEEING HIM
FOR MONTHS.

02:55.276 --> 02:57.378
OH, AND LOOK AT
THAT CUTE LITTLE BUTTON NOSE.

02:57.378 --> 03:00.411
I'D LIKE TO PUT THAT ON A STRING
AND WEAR IT AROUND MY NECK.

03:00.411 --> 03:03.254
SWEETIE, WHEN YOU SAY PEOPLE'S
BODY PARTS ARE SO ADORABLE

03:03.254 --> 03:05.256
THAT YOU WANT TO WEAR THEM,

03:05.256 --> 03:07.258
IT MAKES YOU SEEM
A LITTLE SERIAL KILLER-Y,

03:07.258 --> 03:10.221
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU DO IT
ABOUT KIDS.
OOH, I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE

03:10.221 --> 03:12.323
A SCARF MADE
OF LITTLE BITTY BABY HANDS.

03:12.323 --> 03:14.395
SEE, THAT'S NOT
A GREAT OUT-LOUD THOUGHT.

03:14.395 --> 03:17.398
(sighs)
SO I'M GONNA BE BACK
FROM MY LESSON IN AN HOUR,

03:17.398 --> 03:20.971
AND THEN YOU AND I
WILL HAVE ELLIE DAY.
OH, I'M SO SORRY, BUT I'M
REALLY NOT UP TO IT TODAY.

03:20.971 --> 03:23.434
I JUST KEEP THINKING
ABOUT THAT MESS WITH BOBBY.

03:23.434 --> 03:25.976
AND THEN IT JUST TAKES ME
STRAIGHT BACK TO OBSESSING

03:25.976 --> 03:28.979
ON WHAT AM I DOING WITH MY LIFE,
AND I-I DON'T WANT TO BURDEN YOU

03:28.979 --> 03:31.912
WITH IT, BUT SERIOUSLY,
WHAT AM I DOING WITH MY LIFE?

03:31.912 --> 03:34.915
I MEAN, ELLIE,
AM I GOING TO BE ALONE FOREVER?
HOW ARE WE BACK HERE AGAIN?

03:34.915 --> 03:38.689
PLEASE. I COULD GET BACK TO THIS
PLACE FROM ANYWHERE. SAY A WORD.
EGGPLANT.

03:38.689 --> 03:39.990
EGGPLANTS ARE VEGETABLES.

03:39.990 --> 03:41.992
MY UNCLE'S A VEGETABLE
BECAUSE HE GOT HIT BY A TRUCK.

03:41.992 --> 03:43.994
TRUCKS CARRY BEERS.
BEERS COME IN 40s.

03:43.994 --> 03:47.758
I'M 40 AND ALONE, AND WHAT AM I
DOING WITH MY LIFE, ELLIE?
WOW.

03:47.758 --> 03:49.530
ANDY, WHERE YOU GOIN'?

03:49.530 --> 03:51.602
SORRY, CAPTAIN.
HAVE TO BOUNCE.

03:51.602 --> 03:53.604
COME ON, MAN.
IT'S TIME YOU START LIVING

03:53.604 --> 03:56.337
LIKE YOU HAVE A MUSTACHE.
OH, THAT'S JUST GIBBERISH.

03:56.337 --> 03:57.838
NO, NO, IT'S NOT. UH...

03:57.838 --> 04:00.841
IT MEANS I HAVE TO ASK MYSELF
THE ULTIMATE QUESTION--

04:00.841 --> 04:03.243
WHAT WOULD BURT REYNOLDS DO?

04:03.243 --> 04:04.745
I'M GONNA CALL ELLIE.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.016
HELL, YEAH! ANDY!

04:06.016 --> 04:09.680
(crowd chants) ANDY! ANDY! ANDY!
(Andy) SHH.

04:09.680 --> 04:11.652
(cell phone rings)
WHAT? I'M BUSY.

04:11.652 --> 04:15.255
OH, HEY, LOOK, UH,
BOBBY'S HURTING REAL BAD.

04:15.255 --> 04:18.028
Uh, you think
I should stay with him?
DO WHATEVER. I'VE GOTTA GO.

04:18.028 --> 04:20.331
HEY, EVERYBODY! I'M IN!

04:20.331 --> 04:21.992
(man, flatly) YAY.

04:21.992 --> 04:24.765
OH. THEY SEEMED MORE INVESTED
A SECOND AGO.

04:24.765 --> 04:29.269
YOU GOTTA TURN YOUR HIPS.
YEAH, BUT I'M CONFUSED. I THINK
YOU SHOULD SHOW ME AGAIN.

04:29.269 --> 04:32.973
HEY, THERE. ELLIE SAID
YOU HAD ROOM FOR ONE MORE?

04:32.973 --> 04:35.005
ALWAYS.

04:35.005 --> 04:37.778
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

04:37.778 --> 04:39.910
COME ON. A LITTLE FLIRTY-FLIRTY
MIGHT HELP ME WITH MY MOOD.

04:39.910 --> 04:41.912
DON'T GET BUMMED
IF HE IGNORES YOU,

04:41.912 --> 04:43.854
BECAUSE HE'S PRETTY
INTO ME.

04:43.854 --> 04:45.856
AREN'T YOU A LITTLE WORRIED
ABOUT YOUR GRUNTING?

04:45.856 --> 04:47.988
(chuckles) YOU SOUND LIKE
A LUMBERJACK.

04:47.988 --> 04:51.722
(grunts loudly)
(high-pitched voice) AH!

04:51.722 --> 04:54.525
(grunts)
OH!

04:54.525 --> 04:57.067
(grunts)
YES!

04:57.067 --> 05:00.731
(grunts)
OH, GOD!

05:00.731 --> 05:05.406
DID YOU REALLY JUST SAY
"OH, GOD"?

05:05.406 --> 05:06.737
I QUIT.

05:08.439 --> 05:13.414
в™Єв™Єв™Є

05:20.621 --> 05:24.525
OH, GOD. (groans)
I HAVE HEARTBURN IN MY BRAIN.

05:24.525 --> 05:26.357
WHERE'S ANDY?

05:26.357 --> 05:28.028
(growls)

05:30.631 --> 05:31.962
(laughs) OH, YEAH.

05:31.962 --> 05:35.506
I PUT YOU IN CAN-JAIL
FOR PARTYING TOO HARD.

05:35.506 --> 05:38.369
I GOTTA GET HOME!

05:38.369 --> 05:41.842
WHY ARE HIS PANTS
SO LONG AND TIGHT?

05:41.842 --> 05:45.115
(laughs)
OH, YEAH. WE TRADED.

05:47.047 --> 05:49.580
(sultry voice) MMM!

05:49.580 --> 05:51.422
OOH!

05:51.422 --> 05:53.083
OH, GOD!

05:53.083 --> 05:54.685
GOOD COFFEE, MRS. TORRES?

05:54.685 --> 05:56.857
SHE'S JUST MOCKING ME
BECAUSE YESTERDAY,

05:56.857 --> 05:58.859
SEE, WHEN I WAS MAKING
THOSE NOISES--

05:58.859 --> 06:00.130
I'M OUT.

06:00.130 --> 06:03.434
I'M ALLOWED TO MAKE
FAKE SEXUAL NOISES, TRAVIS!

06:03.434 --> 06:05.936
THAT'S A WEIRD THING
TO TAKE A STAND ON.

06:05.936 --> 06:06.967
I SHOULDN'T...

06:06.967 --> 06:09.369
(slurring)
OH! OH, HEY. HI.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.842
I'M SO SORRY I WAS--
I WAS OUT ALL NIGHT.

06:11.842 --> 06:13.944
UH, BOBBY WAS SO DOWN.

06:13.944 --> 06:16.076
TEENY TINY HEADACHE.

06:16.076 --> 06:17.948
YOU MISSED SOME IDIOT
CALLING 20 TIMES

06:17.948 --> 06:20.150
AT, LIKE, 4:00 IN THE MORNING.

06:20.150 --> 06:23.914
I HAVE TO CHECK MY VOICE MAIL
TO SEE WHO I HAVE TO KILL.
OH, I'LL--I'LL DO THAT
FOR YOU.

06:23.914 --> 06:26.016
SO WHEN'S
OUR NEXT TENNIS LESSON?
NEVER.

06:26.016 --> 06:29.790
I CALL DIBS ON ALEX.
YOU CAN'T CALL DIBS.
YOU'RE MARRIED.

06:29.790 --> 06:33.393
HEY.
HEY, WILL YOU HELP US FIGURE OUT
WHO GETS DIBS ON A GUY?

06:33.393 --> 06:36.066
WELL, THAT'S EASY.
WHICH ONE OF YOU'S PREGNANT?
NO ONE.

06:36.066 --> 06:40.531
WELL, THEN I GOT NOTHING.
(Andy's voice, slurring)
Hello! Wake up. I miss you!

06:40.531 --> 06:42.803
ANDY. WHO IS IT?

06:42.803 --> 06:45.736
(beep)
A... PHONE SOLICITOR.

06:45.736 --> 06:49.680
AND DELETE.
ALL RIGHT, YOU HAVE TO LET ME
COME ON ANOTHER LESSON.

06:49.680 --> 06:52.042
YOU JUST DON'T WANT ME TO GO
BECAUSE YOU'RE SCARED

06:52.042 --> 06:54.044
THAT ALEX IS GONNA LIKE ME
MORE THAN YOU,

06:54.044 --> 06:57.688
BECAUSE I KNOW
HOW TO TALK LIKE YOUNG PEOPLE.
OH, REALLY?

06:57.688 --> 06:59.189
CHILLAX. TWEET. RIHANNA.

06:59.189 --> 07:01.922
(laughs) WOW. WHAT? WHAT?

07:01.922 --> 07:04.094
HATE MYSELF.

07:04.094 --> 07:07.928
GO AHEAD AND COME TOMORROW.
OH, IT IS SO ON!

07:07.928 --> 07:09.930
YOU CAN'T BE HAPPY
WHEN YOU SAY THAT.

07:09.930 --> 07:12.933
THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS. TRY IT
AGAIN. YOU HAVE TO BE MEAN.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.536
(deepens voice) IT IS SO ON,
YOU STUPID BITCH.
WOW.

07:15.536 --> 07:18.639
(normal voice)
WAS THAT TOO MUCH?
YEAH.

07:18.639 --> 07:20.440
(door opens)

07:20.440 --> 07:22.513
HEY, CAN WE TALK?
OKAY, NEVER BARGE IN

07:22.513 --> 07:25.115
ON AN 18-YEAR-OLD
WHO HAS THE INTERNET.

07:25.115 --> 07:27.177
ONCE AGAIN, I ACT
WITHOUT THINKING. (sighs)

07:27.177 --> 07:29.850
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

07:29.850 --> 07:33.023
I DID SOMETHING
THAT I REALLY, REALLY REGRET.

07:33.023 --> 07:36.026
AND THE WORST PART IS,
WHENEVER I FEEL THIS DOWN,

07:36.026 --> 07:38.028
I ALWAYS END UP
BACK TOGETHER WITH DALE.

07:38.028 --> 07:39.990
IT HAPPENS SO OFTEN

07:39.990 --> 07:42.993
THAT I KEEP A DRAWER OF STUFF
AT HIS HOUSE, TRAVIS, YOU KNOW,

07:42.993 --> 07:46.466
A TOOTHBRUSH, SHAMPOO, MY
JESSICA SIMPSON HAIR EXTENSIONS.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.468
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST GO GET YOUR STUFF

07:48.468 --> 07:50.641
SO YOU'LL NEVER HAVE TO GO BACK?
(slap)

07:50.641 --> 07:52.503
THAT IS SO SMART!
MM.

07:52.503 --> 07:55.506
YOU SHOULD MAKE ALL MY DECISIONS
FOR ME IN LIFE. COME ON.

07:55.506 --> 07:58.048
YOU COULD BE LIKE MY CONSCIENCE,
JUST SITTING ON MY SHOULDER.

07:58.048 --> 08:00.511
"HEY, LAURIE,
DO THE RIGHT THING."

08:00.511 --> 08:02.152
"NO, THE BAD THING'S
SO MUCH FUN."

08:02.152 --> 08:05.055
"SHUT UP,
BAD SIDE OF LAURIE."

08:05.055 --> 08:08.559
COME WITH ME TO DALE'S.
(whispers) PLEASE.

08:08.559 --> 08:11.622
HOW COULD I SAY NO TO THAT?
(knock on door)

08:11.622 --> 08:13.924
(Jules)
TRAVIS, I'M COMING IN.

08:13.924 --> 08:17.097
MY HAND IS ON THE DOOR.
(mouths word)

08:17.097 --> 08:19.099
OKAY,
I'M IN THE ROOM NOW.

08:19.099 --> 08:21.101
DO I HAVE
THE ALL-CLEAR SIGN?

08:21.101 --> 08:23.033
THAT IS HOW YOU ENTER
TRAVIS' ROOM.

08:27.037 --> 08:28.879
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

08:30.881 --> 08:33.844
I HATE TO LEAVE YOU ALONE
TWO NIGHTS IN A ROW,

08:33.844 --> 08:37.247
BUT BOBBY'S STILL
IN A VERY BAD WAY.

08:37.247 --> 08:39.119
HE NEEDS ME, ELLIE.

08:39.119 --> 08:40.851
WHATEVER.

08:40.851 --> 08:42.693
I AM SPRUNG, BOYS.

08:42.693 --> 08:46.526
(laughs) YEAH! WAIT.
I WANT TO REMEMBER THIS NIGHT.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.098
AH.

08:48.098 --> 08:50.300
(Thin Lizzy's "The Boys
Are Back in Town" playing)

08:50.300 --> 08:56.206
(camera phone shutter clicks)
в™Є THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN,
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN в™Є

08:56.206 --> 09:00.270
в™Є I SAID,
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN в™Є

09:00.270 --> 09:03.273
в™Є THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN в™Є

09:03.273 --> 09:06.276
в™Є THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN,
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN в™Є

09:06.276 --> 09:10.280
в™Є THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN,
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN в™Є

09:10.280 --> 09:13.223
в™Єв™Єв™Є

09:19.289 --> 09:23.233
в™Є THE BOYS ARE
BACK IN TOWN AGAIN в™Є

09:25.295 --> 09:28.238
в™Є BEEN HANGIN' DOWN AT DINO'S в™Є

09:32.272 --> 09:36.276
в™Єв™Єв™Є

09:36.276 --> 09:40.280
в™Є THE BOYS ARE
BACK IN TOWN AGAIN в™Є

09:46.817 --> 09:48.018
HMM.

09:48.018 --> 09:50.120
MAY THE BEST WOMAN WIN.

10:06.076 --> 10:07.207
WOW!

10:07.207 --> 10:09.810
DON'T GO EASY ON ME, ALEX.

10:09.810 --> 10:12.142
SERIOUSLY,
I HAVE NO LIMITS.

10:12.142 --> 10:14.044
(thud)
OH, GOD!

10:14.044 --> 10:16.046
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK WE SHOULD GET STARTED,

10:16.046 --> 10:18.318
BECAUSE EVER SINCE
MISS NO LIMITS HERE TURNED 41,

10:18.318 --> 10:20.320
SHE CAN'T DRIVE AFTER DARK.

10:20.320 --> 10:23.293
DO YOU REALLY THINK YOU SHOULD
BE HITTING THE BALL THAT HARD

10:23.293 --> 10:25.656
SO SOON
AFTER YOUR EPISIOTOMY?

10:25.656 --> 10:29.099
HER BABY'S HEAD--
THIS BIG.

10:29.099 --> 10:33.133
OH! OH!
THAT WAS THE SMALL OF MY BACK.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.135
PLAY OR GO HOME.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.167
I CAN'T BREATHE.
(exhales deeply)

10:37.167 --> 10:40.811
I AM GLAD DALE WASN'T THERE.

10:40.811 --> 10:42.272
HEY, WHAT'S WITH
THESE STREET SIGNS?

10:42.272 --> 10:44.214
"FERNDALE."

10:44.214 --> 10:45.816
"GLENDALE."

10:45.816 --> 10:47.217
"DALE STREET."

10:47.217 --> 10:50.681
THESE ARE ALL SIGNS AN IDIOT
NAMED DALE WOULD HAVE.

10:50.681 --> 10:52.683
WE JUST ROBBED HIM,
DIDN'T WE?

10:52.683 --> 10:55.055
SORRY, TRAVIS!
I JUST WANTED TO HURT HIM.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.757
YOU KNOW,

10:56.757 --> 10:59.359
A BETTER CONSCIENCE
WOULD HAVE STOPPED ME.

10:59.359 --> 11:02.833
RIGHT. THIS IS MY BAD.

11:02.833 --> 11:05.095
IS THAT A REAL HUMAN SKULL?

11:05.095 --> 11:08.839
IT'S HIS GREAT GRANDDAD.
DALE KEEPS IT OUT OF RESPECT.

11:08.839 --> 11:11.201
AND TO SMOKE TOBACKY
OUT OF.

11:11.201 --> 11:13.103
UGH.

11:15.245 --> 11:17.277
WHEW, MAN. REMEMBER
WHEN YOU WERE IN YOUR 20s

11:17.277 --> 11:19.279
AND YOU COULD DRINK ALL NIGHT

11:19.279 --> 11:21.181
AND STILL FEEL GOOD ENOUGH
IN THE MORNING

11:21.181 --> 11:23.954
TO WRITE A LOVE LETTER
TO YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

11:23.954 --> 11:26.216
I WAS A DIFFERENT PERSON
IN COLLEGE.

11:26.216 --> 11:29.019
YOU KNOW WHAT
WE SHOULD DO TONIGHT?
(can fizzes)

11:29.019 --> 11:32.392
A GOOD OLD-FASHIONED
BEER PARADE.
I'M OUT, FELLAS.

11:32.392 --> 11:35.125
LIKE YOUR BELLY BUTTON,
I'M INNIE!

11:35.125 --> 11:39.169
I KNEW YOU WOULD BE, A-TRAIN.
CATCH YOU LATER.

11:39.169 --> 11:43.073
SO YOU'RE JUST GONNA HOLD HIS
HAND WHILE HE HITS ROCK BOTTOM?
(door opens and closes)

11:43.073 --> 11:47.377
WHAT?
YOU KNOW HOW HARD WE PARTIED
THE LAST TWO NIGHTS?

11:47.377 --> 11:51.081
WELL, BOBBY HAS DONE THAT
FOR THE LAST SIX DAYS.

11:51.081 --> 11:52.843
(whispers) RIGHT.

11:52.843 --> 11:56.246
LOOK, I THINK THAT, UH, I THINK
THAT BOBBY'S IN REAL TROUBLE.

11:56.246 --> 11:58.448
(click tongue) AW, MAN.

11:58.448 --> 12:01.852
I KNOW. OH, UM,

12:01.852 --> 12:04.995
WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT THIS?

12:04.995 --> 12:07.157
YOU MAY WANT
TO GET USED TO THAT.

12:07.157 --> 12:10.130
IT'S, UH, PERMANENT MARKER.
(clangs)

12:10.130 --> 12:12.162
OH! (groans)

12:14.765 --> 12:17.067
WELL, OF COURSE YOU'RE GONNA
WIN THIS ALEX THING.

12:17.067 --> 12:19.269
YOU EVEN PICK UP BALLS SEXY.
WHEN I DO IT,

12:19.269 --> 12:22.172
I'M LIKE I'M GOING
TO THE BATHROOM IN THE WOODS.

12:22.172 --> 12:25.245
I'M A VERY SENSUAL PERSON.
I GIVE OFF INTENSE PHEROMONES.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.247
THAT'S WHY CATS
DON'T LIKE ME.

12:27.247 --> 12:30.420
HEY, JULES.
YOU WANNA GRAB DINNER SOMETIME?

12:30.420 --> 12:32.953
I'D LOVE TO.

12:32.953 --> 12:36.286
I WOULD LO-O-O-O-O-OVE TO.

12:36.286 --> 12:37.958
(laughs)

12:37.958 --> 12:40.190
GOOD FOR YOU.

12:40.190 --> 12:43.994
WELL, HEY, YOU CAN'T RUN AWAY,
BECAUSE I'M YOUR RIDE!

12:45.896 --> 12:49.970
ALEX, HAVE YOU SEEN MY KEYS?
(car engine starts)

12:49.970 --> 12:51.441
(gasps)
(tires peal)

12:51.441 --> 12:54.975
OH, COME ON!

13:01.551 --> 13:03.984
YOUR CAR IS IN THE DRIVEWAY.

13:03.984 --> 13:06.256
I THINK YOUR KEYS ARE
SOMEWHERE IN THE BUSHES.

13:06.256 --> 13:08.258
I JUST THOUGHT
WE WERE HAVING FUN,

13:08.258 --> 13:10.260
BUT CLEARLY, THIS LITTLE CONTEST
HAS HIT A NERVE,

13:10.260 --> 13:12.392
SO I'M OFFICIALLY
BACKING OFF OF ALEX FOR YOU.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.925
AND NOT JUST
BECAUSE WHEN HE DROVE ME HOME

13:14.925 --> 13:17.327
I PEEKED BEHIND THE CURTAIN
IN HIS VAN.

13:17.327 --> 13:20.430
HE IS DEFINITELY LIVING IN IT.
YOU DON'T GET IT.
THIS ISN'T ABOUT ALEX.

13:20.430 --> 13:23.433
THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE A BAD FRIEND.
WHAT? NO, NO, NO. HEY.

13:23.433 --> 13:26.336
YOU ARE NOT GONNA SAY SOMETHING
THAT MEAN AND JUST WALK OFF.

13:26.336 --> 13:29.209
(sighs)

13:29.209 --> 13:31.211
COME HERE!

13:31.211 --> 13:34.014
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT BOBBY.

13:34.014 --> 13:35.185
SHOCKER.
(gate clanks)

13:35.185 --> 13:37.317
STOP CHASING ME!

13:37.317 --> 13:39.850
STOP MAKING ME CHASE YOU!

13:39.850 --> 13:41.351
HEY!

13:41.351 --> 13:44.254
ANYWAY,
WE NEED TO TALK TO HIM.

13:44.254 --> 13:47.127
NOT--NOT "WE," YOU.
HE'LL LISTEN TO YOU.

13:47.127 --> 13:49.829
IT'S JUST EVEN THOUGH
I AM THE ALPHA DOG

13:49.829 --> 13:51.831
OF OUR LITTLE TRIO,
I'M NO GOOD

13:51.831 --> 13:54.204
AT SAYING THE TOUGH STUFF
TO BOBBY. I ALWAYS CHICKEN OUT.

13:54.204 --> 13:58.268
YOU'RE LETTING ME HAVE
ALPHA DOG?
I FEEL LIKE YOU NEED IT.

13:58.268 --> 14:01.371
OH, THANK YOU.
NO, NO. NO HUGGING, OKAY?

14:01.371 --> 14:04.014
SINCE WE HAVE TO PUT
ALL OF DALE'S STUFF BACK,

14:04.014 --> 14:06.016
CAN I AT LEAST DRAW A PEEPEE

14:06.016 --> 14:08.578
ON THE SLUT WITH POWER TOOLS
POSTER?
NO.

14:08.578 --> 14:12.182
WOW. DALE HAS
A LOT OF HURTING PARAPHERNALIA.

14:12.182 --> 14:14.224
HE HAS THE THIRD LARGEST
NUNCHAKU COLLECTION

14:14.224 --> 14:17.327
IN ALL OF GULFHAVEN.
DOES THAT MAKE IT HARD FOR HIM
TO STRIVE TO ATTAIN OTHER GOALS?

14:17.327 --> 14:20.060
(door opens)
YEAH, I G-- (gasps)
OH, MY GOD. HE'S HERE.

14:20.060 --> 14:21.861
PUT IT DOWN! GET OUT!

14:21.861 --> 14:23.593
GET IN!

14:29.099 --> 14:31.371
(whispers)
I ALREADY HAVE TO PEE.

14:49.289 --> 14:50.260
(grunts)

14:50.260 --> 14:52.292
HA! GOTCHA!
AAH!

14:52.292 --> 14:53.393
AAH!

14:55.665 --> 14:59.069
(laughs)
OH, MR. AND MRS. WINSTON.

14:59.069 --> 15:01.671
HI, LOTTIE.
YARD'S LOOKING GREAT.

15:03.303 --> 15:04.904
HEY, BOBBY.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.136
THERE'S BUDDY!

15:06.136 --> 15:09.139
JUST IN TIME TO HELP ME
TRY MY NEW SANGRIA HAT.

15:09.139 --> 15:12.312
(sucks loudly)

15:12.312 --> 15:15.315
(laughs) DAMN IT. THE FRUIT
SLICES KEEP CLOGGING THE LINES.

15:15.315 --> 15:18.348
SO YOU COME OVER FOR A REASON
OR JUST TO HANG?

15:18.348 --> 15:20.650
JUST TO HANG.

15:20.650 --> 15:23.693
(clears throat)

15:23.693 --> 15:26.196
LATER DO YOU WANT TO GO
DOWN TO THE BOARDWALK,

15:26.196 --> 15:29.159
SEE IF WE CAN GET A CARICATURE
OF US ON A SURFBOARD

15:29.159 --> 15:31.461
GETTING CHASED
BY A GIANT SHARK?

15:31.461 --> 15:33.303
MORE THAN ANYTHING.
(chuckles)

15:33.303 --> 15:38.038
YOU GOTTA ADMIT,
THAT WAS A LITTLE FUNNY.

15:38.038 --> 15:39.709
I MEAN, NOT TO ME, BUT...

15:39.709 --> 15:42.272
(thud)
IF YOU'RE NOT
GONNA TALK TO ME,

15:42.272 --> 15:45.215
THEN WHY DID YOU
COME BACK TO MY HOUSE?

15:45.215 --> 15:48.348
BECAUSE I'M WET, AND I KNOW
YOU JUST RECOVERED YOUR COUCH.

15:48.348 --> 15:51.121
ALL RIGHT, PLEASE STOP.

15:51.121 --> 15:53.353
I'M GONNA GET THE CHAIR,
TOO.

15:53.353 --> 15:55.255
NO, YOU'RE NOT. NO, YOU'RE NOT.
NO, NO. NO, YOU'RE NOT.

15:55.255 --> 15:57.527
(speaks indistinctly)
STOP IT. NO. LET GO!

15:57.527 --> 15:59.459
AH!

15:59.459 --> 16:01.561
WHATEVER.
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

16:01.561 --> 16:04.094
OF COURSE NOT,
'CAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT JULES.

16:04.094 --> 16:05.595
WHAT?

16:05.595 --> 16:09.039
OH, YOU HEARD YOUR NAME AND YOU
BECAME INTERESTED, DIDN'T YOU?

16:09.039 --> 16:10.340
EVER SINCE THE DIVORCE,

16:10.340 --> 16:12.372
EVERYTHING HAS TO BE
ALL ABOUT YOU.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.374
I ASKED YOU TO HAVE
ONE ELLIE DAY,

16:14.374 --> 16:17.377
AND YOU TOTALLY BLEW IT OFF.
BUT YOU HAD PLENTY OF TIME

16:17.377 --> 16:20.310
TO COME HONE IN ON
MY FAKE BOYFRIEND AND RUIN THAT.

16:20.310 --> 16:23.113
I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE SINGLE

16:23.113 --> 16:25.115
AND START YOUR LIFE
ALL OVER AGAIN.

16:25.115 --> 16:27.757
PLEASE, NOT AGAIN
WITH "I'M 40 AND SINGLE.

16:27.757 --> 16:29.759
"CAN I KISS A GUY
IN PUBLIC?

16:29.759 --> 16:32.722
"CAN I HAVE MY 20s
IN MY 40s?

16:32.722 --> 16:35.225
WHAT IF I END UP ALONE?"

16:35.225 --> 16:38.098
IT'S NOT FAIR. HOW COME I DON'T
GET TO HAVE ONE PROBLEM,

16:38.098 --> 16:42.272
JUST BECAUSE MY MARRIAGE
WORKED OUT AND YOURS DIDN'T?
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S WAY TOO MEAN.

16:42.272 --> 16:44.434
I KNOW.
TAKE-BACKS SO I DON'T SPIRAL.

16:44.434 --> 16:45.705
NO.

16:45.705 --> 16:48.778
I HOPE YOU EAT YOUR GUILT AWAY
AND GAIN 70 POUNDS.

16:48.778 --> 16:50.780
OH, WELL, THAT WAS PERFECT,

16:50.780 --> 16:53.043
'CAUSE NOW I'M NOT
THE ONLY SELFISH ONE.

16:53.043 --> 16:56.246
NOBODY'S EVER CALLED ME SELFISH
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

16:56.246 --> 16:59.349
THAT'S 'CAUSE YOU NEVER
WERE BEFORE. (mouths word)

17:04.124 --> 17:05.795
(man grunting)

17:05.795 --> 17:08.198
(whispering)
HEY. ARE YOU HUNGRY?

17:08.198 --> 17:10.200
(whispering) I'LL TAKE
A GRILLED CHEESE.

17:10.200 --> 17:12.502
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

17:12.502 --> 17:14.504
NO, I END UP IN HERE
SO MUCH,

17:14.504 --> 17:18.438
THAT I STASHED SOME
GRANOLA BARS, JUST IN CASE.

17:18.438 --> 17:21.371
YEAH, ONE TIME I HID IN HERE
TO CATCH DALE CHEATING.

17:21.371 --> 17:23.373
ANOTHER TIME IT WAS
BECAUSE DALE CAME HOME

17:23.373 --> 17:27.177
WHILE I WAS CHEATING
WITH HIS COUSIN.
I BET THAT DUDE
GOT NUNCHAKU'D.

17:27.177 --> 17:29.649
THEY HAD TO REBUILD HIS NOSE
WITH PART OF HIS ELBOW.

17:29.649 --> 17:31.651
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THEY COULD DO IT.

17:31.651 --> 17:35.225
BUT HONESTLY,
IT LOOKED BETTER. (sighs)

17:35.225 --> 17:38.788
I MAKE ONE HORRIBLE DECISION
AFTER ANOTHER.

17:38.788 --> 17:41.291
I'M A RIDICULOUS PERSON.

17:41.291 --> 17:44.464
UH, YOU DON'T MAKE ALL...

17:44.464 --> 17:46.636
GREAT CHOICES,

17:46.636 --> 17:49.339
BUT AT LEAST NOW
WHEN YOU MAKE BAD DECISIONS,

17:49.339 --> 17:51.301
IT ACTUALLY BOTHERS YOU.

17:51.301 --> 17:53.203
IT TOTALLY DOES.

17:53.203 --> 17:54.444
SEE?

17:54.444 --> 17:56.146
IT'S NEW.

17:56.146 --> 17:58.808
IT'S PROGRESS.

17:58.808 --> 18:00.610
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

18:00.610 --> 18:02.452
(Low Stars)
в™Є CALLING ALL FRIENDS в™Є

18:02.452 --> 18:06.656
в™Є AND PEOPLE I MET
ON THE WAY DOWN в™Є

18:06.656 --> 18:09.259
в™Є I'M CALLING ALL FRIENDS
AND PEOPLE I DON'T EVEN KNOW в™Є

18:09.259 --> 18:12.292
SO WHY'D
YOU REALLY COME OVER?

18:12.292 --> 18:14.594
(sighs) I HAVE TO LAY
SOME HARD TRUTH ON YOU,

18:14.594 --> 18:18.268
BUT, UH, I DON'T THINK
I CAN DO IT.
SURE, YOU CAN,
AND I NEED TO HEAR IT.

18:18.268 --> 18:20.830
ALL RIGHT,
LISTEN, BOBBY.

18:20.830 --> 18:22.832
YOU'RE THE LIFE
OF THE PARTY,

18:22.832 --> 18:25.135
AND--AND EVERYBODY LOVES
THAT ABOUT YOU.

18:25.135 --> 18:27.877
GOOD START,
EASE IN WITH THE POSITIVE.

18:27.877 --> 18:31.441
BUT LATELY...

18:31.441 --> 18:33.413
YOU'RE GETTING LOST IN MY EYES.
LOOK AWAY.

18:33.413 --> 18:37.217
OH. ALL RIGHT. UM...

18:37.217 --> 18:39.389
BUT LATELY, YOU'RE--
YOU'RE TAKING IT TOO FAR,

18:39.389 --> 18:41.591
AND IF YOU DON'T STOP
WITH THIS BENDER,

18:41.591 --> 18:44.594
THEN I'M GONNA HAVE
TO STOP LOOKING UP TO YOU,

18:44.594 --> 18:47.157
AND THAT'S GONNA SUCK
FOR ME.

18:47.157 --> 18:50.230
I KNOW THE JULES THING WAS
A REAL KICK IN THE STONES,

18:50.230 --> 18:53.233
BUT...
YOU'LL GET PAST IT.

18:53.233 --> 18:54.904
(chuckles)

18:54.904 --> 18:57.367
JUST NOT LIKE THIS, THOUGH.

18:57.367 --> 18:59.339
YOU'RE BETTER THAN THIS.

18:59.339 --> 19:02.512
AH, MAN.
IT HURTS PRETTY BAD, BUDDY.

19:02.512 --> 19:05.875
в™Є I'VE BEEN LOW в™Є

19:05.875 --> 19:09.279
в™Є YOU WANNA DISAPPEAR
AND NO ONE NEEDS TO KNOW в™Є

19:09.279 --> 19:11.821
HEY, YOU THINK WE CAN GET
THAT BOARDWALK GUY

19:11.821 --> 19:14.153
TO DRAW YOU
WITH SOME DON KING HAIR?

19:14.153 --> 19:17.257
(laughs) YOU WANT TO PUT ME
IN A BIKINI, TOO?

19:17.257 --> 19:19.389
HELL, YOU KNOW IT.
(laughs)
(laughs)

19:19.389 --> 19:23.593
в™Є CALLING ALL FRIENDS AND PEOPLE
I MET ON THE WAY DOWN в™Є
(clears throat) YEAH.

19:23.593 --> 19:25.695
в™Є I'M CALLING ALL FRIENDS в™Є

19:25.695 --> 19:27.697
в™Є AND PEOPLE I DON'T EVEN KNOW в™Є

19:27.697 --> 19:29.699
ARE YOU EATING CAKE
'CAUSE YOU FEEL BAD

19:29.699 --> 19:33.543
ABOUT ALL THE MEAN THINGS
YOU SAID?
NO. I'M JUST EATING CAKE.

19:33.543 --> 19:35.545
LOOK, I-I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT

19:35.545 --> 19:37.877
ALL THE THINGS
THAT WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE,

19:37.877 --> 19:41.451
BECAUSE WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT,
IT JUST MAKES ME SO MAD...

19:41.451 --> 19:44.314
NOT AT YOU, BUT AT MYSELF.

19:44.314 --> 19:46.316
WILL YOU ACCEPT MY APOLOGY?

19:46.316 --> 19:48.488
ALL RIGHT,
BEFORE YOU ANSWER,

19:48.488 --> 19:51.221
I BROUGHT OVER
2 BOTTLES OF $14 WINE,

19:51.221 --> 19:53.223
WHICH I BOUGHT
WITH MY OWN MONEY.

19:53.223 --> 19:56.226
WELL, ACTUALLY I GOT THE MONEY
FROM TRAVIS' WALLET, BUT--

19:56.226 --> 19:58.628
WOW, I MAY HAVE A PROBLEM.
HMM.

19:58.628 --> 20:00.700
ANYWAY, I ALSO BROUGHT
MY LAPTOP COMPUTER,

20:00.700 --> 20:02.702
