00:30.040 --> 00:32.000
I just came to see
how you're feeling.

00:41.560 --> 00:45.000
Activities like that could
really get your heart racing.

01:28.400 --> 01:30.120
Son of a bitch.

02:13.720 --> 02:15.200
Are you crazy?

02:17.360 --> 02:19.600
No, buddy, you're going
to school tomorrow.

02:19.800 --> 02:23.000
So tell her you got a Judo injury
and you can't lift up your arm.

02:23.640 --> 02:25.520
I'm not writing you a note.

02:26.120 --> 02:27.760
You'll manage.

02:28.840 --> 02:30.720
Listen, buddy, I gotta go.
Okay.

02:30.880 --> 02:33.200
Warm yourself up
some schnitzel or burgers.

02:33.360 --> 02:35.040
Bye, little buddy.

02:35.520 --> 02:37.400
[ARABIC]
[Hey, how are you?]

02:37.560 --> 02:38.760
[How's it going?]

02:38.920 --> 02:40.400
[Same same.]

02:42.000 --> 02:43.720
[Did you call home?]

02:45.000 --> 02:46.200
[How's Nadia?]

02:46.360 --> 02:49.480
[It's been a long time
since she felt this good.]

02:49.640 --> 02:52.840
[Good, I'm glad I could help.]

02:53.000 --> 02:56.480
[You know, I'm here
for whatever you need.]

02:56.640 --> 02:58.200
[Thank you.]

03:00.320 --> 03:03.040
[You clearly weren't lying to us
about Abu Ahmad.]

03:03.200 --> 03:04.840
[I told you so.]

03:05.160 --> 03:08.080
[Look, I'll give you a chance
to finish what you started.]

03:08.240 --> 03:10.360
[Where is he?
Who's harboring him?]

03:10.560 --> 03:11.840
[I don't know.]

03:12.000 --> 03:13.760
[Who does know?]

03:14.360 --> 03:16.800
[Go ask his brother
whom you guys killed.]

03:16.960 --> 03:19.360
[Okay, you're free to go.]

03:19.520 --> 03:21.440
[-What do you mean?]
[-You can go.]

03:21.520 --> 03:24.880
[Go celebrate Nadia's treatment
which I arranged for her.]

03:25.040 --> 03:26.080
[Wait.]

03:26.240 --> 03:27.840
[Hold on.]

03:28.000 --> 03:29.600
[Did something
spring to mind?]

03:30.520 --> 03:31.880
He doesn't know a thing.

03:32.040 --> 03:34.120
[I suggest you leave me here
for the weekend.]

03:34.280 --> 03:36.480
[I'd love to,
but you're useless to me.]

03:36.640 --> 03:38.560
[-If only--]
[-Shhh!]

03:38.960 --> 03:41.280
[You have five minutes. Think.]

03:51.080 --> 03:53.600
-Is there peripheral tracking on him?
-What?

03:53.760 --> 03:56.040
-Does the 8200 unit have him tracked?
-Yes.

03:56.200 --> 03:58.920
Then they better keep on high alert.

03:59.240 --> 04:01.280
Make sure they are, okay?

04:11.640 --> 04:14.680
Guard your face, bro.
Keep guarding.

04:15.440 --> 04:17.600
Arms up, bro!
Guard your face.

04:17.880 --> 04:19.720
Guard your face, bro.
Guard your face.

04:19.880 --> 04:21.360
Arms up.

04:21.640 --> 04:23.960
Keep guarding.

04:24.120 --> 04:24.960
Come on!

04:25.120 --> 04:26.880
-What's with you?!
-Arms up.

04:27.040 --> 04:28.360
I'll fuck you up!

04:29.200 --> 04:31.720
-What's with you, man?!
-Come on, you bastard!

04:31.880 --> 04:36.440
Something's wrong with you.
Come on, arms up. Guard your face.

04:36.760 --> 04:38.680
Arms up!

04:39.640 --> 04:41.800
-Come on, arms up.
-Here.

04:43.800 --> 04:46.280
-Fuck you, asshole!
-No, fuck you!

04:46.440 --> 04:48.080
Go home, you prick.

04:48.960 --> 04:51.880
-What are you looking at?
-Boaz, just go home.

04:52.040 --> 04:54.440
Why?
Is it too dangerous for me?

04:54.600 --> 04:55.960
Go home!

04:56.760 --> 04:58.880
Come on,
let's do a round.

04:59.040 --> 05:01.640
I think you've had too much wine.
You've gained weight, bro.

05:01.800 --> 05:04.560
I said, let's do a round!

05:05.040 --> 05:07.520
Off to tell Moreno?

05:07.680 --> 05:08.960
To bitch to him again,

05:09.120 --> 05:12.240
and to make deals behind my back
to kick me out of my own team?

05:12.400 --> 05:14.720
The bastard wants
to kick me out of my unit!

05:14.880 --> 05:18.360
Boaz, right now you're risking
yourself and your team.

05:18.520 --> 05:20.120
Go home and rest.

05:20.640 --> 05:23.480
Come on,
let's do one last round!

05:23.640 --> 05:27.360
If it weren't for me,
you'd be dead by now, you loser!

05:27.520 --> 05:28.480
Oh, yeah?

05:28.760 --> 05:30.600
Put your boxing gloves on.

05:39.320 --> 05:40.760
Come!

05:42.040 --> 05:43.600
Fuck him up.

05:47.280 --> 05:51.640
-The two of you can suck my dick.
-He's gonna fuck you up.

05:55.800 --> 05:57.400
Arms up!

05:57.760 --> 06:01.640
Arms up!
Guard your face.

06:05.360 --> 06:07.880
Come on, arms up.

06:23.960 --> 06:25.480
Are you alright, Boaz?

06:25.760 --> 06:27.480
Go away!
Don't touch me!

06:27.800 --> 06:30.720
You don't know anything.
It's my team.

06:30.880 --> 06:32.360
I'm a machine, get it?

06:32.520 --> 06:34.880
You might not need me,
but they do.

06:35.400 --> 06:37.400
Son of a bitch!

06:44.280 --> 06:46.200
What's with him?

06:51.120 --> 06:57.560
TUL QAREM

07:19.400 --> 07:23.920
[-Daddy!]
[-My God, look at my pretty daughter.]

07:24.080 --> 07:25.520
[She's so pretty!]

07:25.680 --> 07:27.920
[-How are you?]
[-Fine.]

07:34.920 --> 07:36.480
[Thank you.]

07:38.080 --> 07:39.840
[I'm so glad you're here.]

07:40.000 --> 07:42.160
[I'll get the shower
ready for you.]

07:42.320 --> 07:44.800
[Nadia, I want to talk
to Daddy, okay?]

07:47.040 --> 07:50.880
[-She looks better, doesn't she?]
[-Yes, but I'm scared.]

07:51.040 --> 07:53.880
[Everyone says that Nadia
was treated at Hadassah Hospital]

07:54.040 --> 07:56.640
[because you collaborated
with the Jews.]

07:57.000 --> 07:58.160
[Nonsense.]

07:58.320 --> 07:59.960
[This won't end well.]

08:00.120 --> 08:02.920
[Don't worry.
I told you, I'll take care of it.]

08:03.080 --> 08:05.120
[-Alright, but don't go outside.]
[-I have to,]

08:05.280 --> 08:07.160
[or they'll think
I'm a collaborator.]

08:07.560 --> 08:09.960
[Enough.
I'll take care of it.]

08:30.160 --> 08:31.520
[-Hello, Ali.]
[-Hello.]

08:31.680 --> 08:33.120
[-Welcome back.]
[-May God keep you safe.]

08:33.280 --> 08:34.800
[-Everything alright?]
[-Yes, thank God.]

08:34.960 --> 08:37.560
[We were worried, we thought
the Jews killed you.]

08:37.720 --> 08:39.760
[The Jews would be
the last to kill me.]

08:39.920 --> 08:41.960
[-Stay safe.]
[-Bye.]

08:51.080 --> 08:52.960
[-Peace be upon you.]
[-Upon you be peace.]

08:53.120 --> 08:55.160
[We're glad you're back
from those animals.]

08:55.320 --> 08:56.040
[God bless you.]

08:56.200 --> 08:58.120
[We were brought up
on stories about you.]

08:58.280 --> 09:02.680
[My father used to say
you'd rid us of all the Jews here,]

09:02.840 --> 09:05.480
[but I'm glad he died
before witnessing this shame.]

09:05.640 --> 09:10.600
[You got Bashir killed and you'll pay
for it, you bastard. I spit on you!]

09:38.200 --> 09:40.720
[-Peace be upon you.]
[-Upon you be peace.]

09:40.880 --> 09:42.320
[God is listening
to your prayers.]

09:44.960 --> 09:48.080
[I need to meet with Abu Ahmad
so he can clear my name.]

09:48.240 --> 09:51.200
[I was never, nor will I ever be,
a collaborator.]

09:51.360 --> 09:55.520
[I taught the Panther, he got
as far as he did thanks to me.]

09:55.680 --> 09:57.720
[I remember.]

09:58.280 --> 10:01.440
[They yell "traitor" on the street.
But what did I do?]

10:01.600 --> 10:03.640
[I've dedicated my life
to the struggle,]

10:03.800 --> 10:06.600
[for what? Just to be shamed
in broad daylight?]

10:06.760 --> 10:09.280
[Calm down, Ali.]

10:09.440 --> 10:12.760
[I'm a traitor?! They yell "traitor"
on the street!]

10:12.920 --> 10:16.200
[Main thing is to find out what
the Jews know about the big attack,]

10:16.360 --> 10:18.680
[and to be careful.]

10:19.840 --> 10:22.480
[They know about Abu Ahmad,
or at least they suspect it.]

10:24.480 --> 10:27.040
[-How could that be?]
[-I don't know.]

10:29.720 --> 10:31.320
[What about the attack?]

10:31.480 --> 10:35.680
[They suspect something big is
brewing, but they have no leads.]

10:36.640 --> 10:39.040
[I must meet
with Abu Ahmad.]

10:39.760 --> 10:41.960
[Not a chance.]

10:42.120 --> 10:45.400
[Why?
What am I at fault for?]

10:45.560 --> 10:47.320
[I don't know.]

10:47.600 --> 10:50.320
[Abu Ahmad must clear my name]

10:50.480 --> 10:52.400
[or they'll kill me.]

10:52.920 --> 10:54.240
Moreno.

10:55.840 --> 10:58.400
-What's going on there?
-He's getting hysterical.

10:58.560 --> 11:00.040
[I'm not afraid of death.]

11:00.200 --> 11:03.280
[Don't think that death
scares me, it doesn't]

11:05.480 --> 11:07.400
[I'm not scared to die,]

11:07.560 --> 11:08.840
[but my daughter,]

11:09.000 --> 11:11.280
[my daughter will die
without me.]

11:11.800 --> 11:15.080
[-You remember Nadia?]
[-I do.]

11:15.280 --> 11:18.320
[How is she doing?
I heard she was better.]

11:26.960 --> 11:28.440
[I'll take care of it.]

11:28.600 --> 11:32.200
[I'll see who I need to talk to
and we'll end this story.]

11:32.360 --> 11:35.840
[Go in good health,
and don't worry.]

11:36.000 --> 11:38.760
[Thank you.
Thank you.]

11:40.200 --> 11:42.160
[-Thank you.]
[-Goodbye.]

11:46.480 --> 11:49.680
-Great. I'm hungry.
-I don't know...

11:49.840 --> 11:51.880
I don't think Abu Ahmad
will agree to meet with him.

11:52.040 --> 11:54.600
-They totally suspect Ali.
-Don't worry.

11:55.440 --> 11:57.040
Abu Ahmad won't miss a chance

11:57.200 --> 11:59.880
to look into the eyes
of the man who betrayed him.

12:00.600 --> 12:04.360
[His daughter is getting VIP treatment
at Hadassah Hospital.]

12:04.520 --> 12:07.960
[He put all his bank accounts
on his wife's name.]

12:12.080 --> 12:14.560
[Don't you think he's collaborating
with the Secret Service?]

12:14.720 --> 12:17.120
[Why did he return to town?]

12:17.440 --> 12:19.800
[And why does he want
to meet with you?]

12:20.400 --> 12:22.800
[He's working with the Jews,
for sure.]

12:29.960 --> 12:32.040
[We'd better hide
in another house.]

12:32.200 --> 12:34.840
[You never know
who's an informant.]

12:35.280 --> 12:37.320
[Who do you think it is?]

12:37.480 --> 12:39.680
[Ali Al-Karmi, of course.]

12:40.080 --> 12:41.800
[It's obvious.]

12:43.760 --> 12:47.120
[-How old are you, Walid?]
[-20.]

12:47.280 --> 12:48.800
[Nice.]

12:49.640 --> 12:54.080
[When I was 16,
I worked for Ali.]

12:54.480 --> 12:57.000
[Ali was like a father to me.]

12:57.240 --> 13:00.960
[He took care of everything for me.
Food, drink, shelter, the works.]

13:01.680 --> 13:03.880
[One time,
I made a fatal mistake.]

13:04.040 --> 13:07.600
[The IDF was after me,
and I ran to hide in his house.]

13:07.760 --> 13:10.320
[When he opened the door,]

13:10.760 --> 13:13.840
[he should've sent me away,
not to mess with the army.]

13:16.920 --> 13:19.680
[But he welcomed me
with a smile.]

13:19.840 --> 13:23.000
[He gave me 50 shekels
and let me out the back door.]

13:26.120 --> 13:28.960
[The army came there
and beat Ali up,]

13:29.120 --> 13:31.920
[humiliated him before his family
and destroyed his house,]

13:32.440 --> 13:35.120
[but Ali didn't say a word.]

13:35.920 --> 13:39.520
[Not a word, for my sake.]

13:46.840 --> 13:48.800
[I want to meet with him.]

13:49.480 --> 13:52.280
[Alright. Don't worry.]

14:59.280 --> 15:02.840
Naor: I feel awkward writing this,
but I really miss you.

15:24.240 --> 15:25.680
Hey.

15:26.920 --> 15:28.800
Hey.

15:46.280 --> 15:48.040
Come here.

16:06.640 --> 16:11.320
You chose the sporty-elegant look.
What an impressive guy you are.

16:11.680 --> 16:14.000
I see you're staying
in the clothes you wore all day.

16:14.160 --> 16:16.720
Don't you think a bouquet
will embarrass her?

16:16.880 --> 16:19.800
Why? Doesn't Gali like it
when you bring her flowers?

16:19.960 --> 16:22.160
She does, but it looks--

16:22.320 --> 16:24.200
It's been a while since
you brought her flowers, huh?

16:24.360 --> 16:26.080
Like you're a big expert
on relationships.

16:26.240 --> 16:28.560
Your longest relationship
lasted 48 hours,

16:28.720 --> 16:30.400
and it was with a wanted person.

16:30.560 --> 16:32.200
I know enough
not to get into one.

16:32.360 --> 16:35.480
Anyway, be gentle
and sensitive towards Shirin,

16:35.640 --> 16:38.280
and apologize
for standing her up.

16:39.560 --> 16:42.160
Okay, relax.

16:43.960 --> 16:45.640
Relax.

16:48.400 --> 16:51.000
-Gentle and sensitive.
-Like you.

16:51.160 --> 16:52.160
[My darling.]

16:59.320 --> 17:01.960
[Sorry about last night.]

17:04.920 --> 17:07.600
NABLUS

17:42.680 --> 17:45.480
[Hi. These are for you.]

17:47.440 --> 17:49.000
[No, thanks.]

17:49.160 --> 17:52.480
[-I want to apologize for last night.]
[-I get it, but I'm not interested.]

17:52.640 --> 17:55.200
[Just give me
two minutes of your time.]

17:57.040 --> 17:59.880
[-You're stubborn.]
[-Not always.]

18:00.040 --> 18:01.280
[Then why now?]

18:01.440 --> 18:03.720
[I guess you make me
behave this way.]

18:06.080 --> 18:07.600
[Excuse me,]

18:08.560 --> 18:11.040
[take these flowers
to Pediatrics.]

18:14.680 --> 18:16.480
[I won't hold you back,]

18:16.640 --> 18:20.720
[in case your sister's roof
is flooded or something.]

18:20.960 --> 18:24.440
[I'm sorry. I wanted to stay,
but I had to go.]

18:24.600 --> 18:26.640
[I guess the lie didn't work, huh?]

18:26.800 --> 18:30.360
[-Not at all.]
[-Well, I'm a bad liar.]

18:31.800 --> 18:35.600
[My mother said that if she catches me
talking to a strange man at work--]

18:35.760 --> 18:39.440
[I don't think you care
about what your mother says.]

18:39.720 --> 18:43.400
[I care only about
what my mother says.]

18:43.560 --> 18:45.760
[So you're a good girl?]

18:46.200 --> 18:48.240
[Can't you tell?]

18:49.000 --> 18:52.160
[Now I did, when you spoke.]

18:53.840 --> 18:57.440
[There should always be
at least one person in your life]

18:57.600 --> 19:00.160
[whom you know
you should listen to,]

19:00.320 --> 19:03.440
[because he wants only
what's best for you.]

19:08.000 --> 19:11.880
[You know what?
I have a very dear relative]

19:12.040 --> 19:13.960
[who's young,]

19:14.120 --> 19:18.400
[and sees me as his older brother.
I'm the only one who listens to him.]

19:20.640 --> 19:23.280
[His love was killed
in a car accident this week.]

19:23.440 --> 19:25.320
[May God have mercy
on her soul.]

19:26.720 --> 19:29.560
[He's so miserable,]

19:30.240 --> 19:33.520
[and I can't seem to help him.
I don't know how.]

19:39.040 --> 19:41.240
[Perhaps your mother
could step in?]

19:43.440 --> 19:45.400
[Okay, I'll ask her.]

19:49.080 --> 19:52.440
[Listen, it was nice of you
to stop by,]

19:52.600 --> 19:55.080
[but I have to get back to work.]

19:55.240 --> 19:56.880
[Sure thing.]

19:57.040 --> 19:58.520
[So we're good?]

19:58.680 --> 20:00.640
[I've changed
and you forgive me.]

20:00.800 --> 20:02.640
[Maybe.]

20:03.240 --> 20:05.160
[I'll think about it.]

20:06.280 --> 20:07.760
[Bye.]

20:14.040 --> 20:16.120
[-Hello?]
-Hello, handsome.

20:16.760 --> 20:19.560
[-Hey, good-looking.]
-How's it going with the doctor?

20:19.720 --> 20:22.000
[-Not bad.]
-Did the flowers do the job?

20:22.160 --> 20:24.080
[-Possibly.]
-Is she in love?

20:24.240 --> 20:26.440
[I don't think so.]

20:26.600 --> 20:28.240
And you?
Are you in love?

20:28.400 --> 20:29.200
[With whom?]

20:29.360 --> 20:32.360
With the doctor, you microbe.
I know she turns you on.

20:33.560 --> 20:35.000
[Why do you think that?]

20:35.160 --> 20:37.720
I know you. I've seen you
get ready for your date.

20:37.880 --> 20:40.200
I've never seen you
this groomed.

20:41.640 --> 20:44.000
Just kidding.
Come on, I need you here stat.

20:44.160 --> 20:46.760
[-Why?]
-Because of our friend in Hamas.

20:46.920 --> 20:47.680
[What about him?]

20:47.840 --> 20:50.080
We let him out.
There could be developments.

20:50.240 --> 20:52.840
-Just come.
[-I'm coming.]

21:15.560 --> 21:16.960
Here.

21:21.640 --> 21:24.960
-Give me a bite.
-Why didn't you get your own?

21:25.120 --> 21:28.080
I didn't think I'd want one.
Come on.

21:28.600 --> 21:30.240
Come on!

21:35.760 --> 21:37.000
Thanks.

21:45.040 --> 21:47.240
I'm going to tell Doron.

21:53.120 --> 21:54.640
What?

21:56.080 --> 21:59.960
-You surprised me.
-We've talked about it a hundred times.

22:00.680 --> 22:04.480
-What will you tell him?
-The truth.

22:04.640 --> 22:06.400
And tell him what?

22:06.560 --> 22:08.720
That I don't love him anymore.

22:10.120 --> 22:12.040
What will you say about me?

22:14.280 --> 22:16.920
That I want to live with you.

22:21.680 --> 22:24.680
-Having second thoughts?
-No.

22:25.360 --> 22:27.360
Then why did you panic?

22:30.360 --> 22:33.360
Because he just returned to the unit
and I don't know how they'll take it.

22:33.520 --> 22:36.320
But you wanted us to tell him,
so we stop sneaking around.

22:36.480 --> 22:39.000
Yeah, but now
it's not that simple.

22:45.640 --> 22:47.880
So you don't want me
to tell him?

22:49.240 --> 22:51.680
Wait a little.

22:55.800 --> 22:57.280
Stop it.

22:58.200 --> 23:01.200
-Come on, Gali.
-Stop. Stop!

23:01.920 --> 23:03.720
Gali, Gali...

23:06.960 --> 23:10.440
For fuck's sake...
You're both idiots.

23:10.600 --> 23:12.320
-Gali...
-When I see Doron,

23:12.480 --> 23:16.440
I'm telling him I'm leaving him
but don't worry,

23:17.480 --> 23:19.600
I won't say a word about us.

23:19.760 --> 23:22.760
-Gali, hold on.
-Screw you!

24:14.360 --> 24:15.600
[Who is it?]

24:15.760 --> 24:17.280
[Unlisted number.]

24:17.440 --> 24:18.560
[Give me.]

24:18.720 --> 24:20.600
[Maybe you shouldn't answer.]

24:21.520 --> 24:24.400
[-Hello?]
[-Be at the courtyard in two hours.]

24:24.560 --> 24:26.200
[The courtyard?]

24:27.120 --> 24:28.640
[It's him.]

24:28.920 --> 24:30.520
[Abu Ahmad?]

24:30.680 --> 24:33.160
[Did they tell you it's him?]

24:35.120 --> 24:37.840
[How can you be sure
it's not a trap?]

24:39.800 --> 24:42.960
[The sheikh promised
he'd take care of it.]

24:43.120 --> 24:46.320
[But if they suspect you've
spoken with the Jews--]

24:46.480 --> 24:50.720
[Don't worry. No one would harm
a leadership senior of my status.]

25:09.760 --> 25:12.040
-What's that?
-My regular perfume.

25:12.200 --> 25:13.720
Not that, that.

25:13.920 --> 25:15.400
Ali Karmi's phone tapping.

25:15.560 --> 25:17.520
[Be at the courtyard in two hours.]

25:17.680 --> 25:19.360
They told him to be
at the courtyard in two hours.

25:19.520 --> 25:21.240
-What did they say?
-Just that.

25:21.840 --> 25:23.160
-It's Abu Ahmad.
-Maybe.

25:23.320 --> 25:26.640
For sure. Who else would Karmi go
to these lengths for? Only Abu Ahmad.

25:26.800 --> 25:30.120
I want the entire team here, stat.
Steve, Avihai, Naor, Boaz, everyone.

25:30.280 --> 25:31.800
Where's Doron?

25:33.640 --> 25:36.640
Get them all here, stat.

25:39.520 --> 25:41.640
Doron, it's go time.
You're the commander in the field.

25:41.800 --> 25:42.720
We're running late.

25:42.880 --> 25:45.600
-Why is Boaz coming?
-I need you all.

25:45.760 --> 25:46.880
But we talked about this.

25:47.040 --> 25:50.960
And I didn't agree, except for that day
when Boaz was excluded.

25:51.120 --> 25:53.840
-Today he's back in.
-No, he's not.

25:54.440 --> 25:55.320
Yes, he is.

25:55.480 --> 25:57.360
Decide if you're
your brother-in-law's babysitter

25:57.520 --> 25:58.400
or if he's a fighter here.

25:58.560 --> 25:59.960
He's my brother-in-law
and a fighter here.

26:00.040 --> 26:00.880
Good.

26:01.040 --> 26:03.400
So why don't the both of you
take a hike.

26:03.560 --> 26:06.080
Go pick grapes
at the vineyard.

26:07.680 --> 26:09.080
Moreno.

26:11.320 --> 26:14.280
As commander, I'm assigning him
as a lookout. Is that clear?

26:14.440 --> 26:15.280
Cool.

26:15.440 --> 26:17.840
You're the commander,
you call the shots.

26:35.400 --> 26:36.920
What's up?

26:39.360 --> 26:40.840
Everything alright?

26:41.760 --> 26:45.240
-We've got a mission.
-Awesome.

26:45.400 --> 26:48.600
-What's the plan?
-Catch your breath first.

26:48.840 --> 26:51.600
-The boss.
-Did you nap?

26:52.960 --> 26:53.960
At noon.

26:56.440 --> 27:00.920
We're going to catch Abu Ahmad.
Ali Karmi's on his way to him.

27:01.600 --> 27:03.320
-Are you focused?
-Totally.

27:03.680 --> 27:05.680
You'll be the lookout.

27:06.200 --> 27:07.760
Are you shitting with me?

27:07.920 --> 27:11.880
-I asked if you're focused. Are you?
-Yes! Yes.

27:14.480 --> 27:17.240
You follow me and listen
only to me, understood?

27:17.400 --> 27:18.760
What?

27:19.760 --> 27:21.440
Just kidding.

27:21.600 --> 27:24.320
-I'll go get dressed.
-Do it.

27:24.480 --> 27:25.280
I will.

27:27.280 --> 27:28.760
-Boaz?
-What?

27:29.760 --> 27:31.320
Nothing.
Go get dressed.

28:04.040 --> 28:08.240
Nurit, the Hijab
sure brings out your...

28:09.000 --> 28:10.160
...your eyes.

28:10.320 --> 28:12.520
Quit flirting.
"Brings out your eyes"...

28:12.680 --> 28:14.160
Like you ever stood
a chance with her.

28:14.320 --> 28:16.640
When was the last time a girl
looked at you, you troll?

28:16.800 --> 28:20.000
"When was the last time..."
Think I'm a faggot like you?

28:20.280 --> 28:24.360
Not that there's anything wrong
with it. You're a handsome guy.

28:24.560 --> 28:26.560
But seriously, Boozi,

28:27.160 --> 28:31.240
don't jerk guys off with your
gun hand, you'll hurt yourself.

28:37.120 --> 28:38.760
What is it, Boozi?
Cat got your tongue?

28:38.920 --> 28:41.160
No, he just stuck it
up his ass, bro.

28:41.320 --> 28:43.600
Shut up, all of you!

28:51.560 --> 28:55.800
Doron, the 35th Assistance Force
is held back. You guys go in alone.

28:57.360 --> 28:59.800
Doron, Ali Karmi is 15 minutes
away from the target.

28:59.960 --> 29:03.520
Listen, guys. You guys know
exactly what to do, right?

29:03.680 --> 29:07.480
Each assumes his corner,
like we planned, understood?

29:07.640 --> 29:09.280
Boaz, are you with me?

29:10.000 --> 29:12.200
-Are you?
-I am.

29:12.880 --> 29:15.440
We get Abu Ahmad
and drive back.

29:55.880 --> 29:57.880
[-Peace be upon you.]
[-Upon you be peace.]

30:29.560 --> 30:31.120
[Where are you taking me?]

30:31.280 --> 30:32.960
[You'll see soon enough.]

30:35.400 --> 30:37.560
[I asked,
where are you taking me?]

30:40.440 --> 30:42.080
[You can go back home if you wish.]

30:42.240 --> 30:44.160
[But I recall you asked
for this meeting.]

32:18.320 --> 32:21.160
[-Peace be upon you.]
[-Peace be upon you, Abu Ahmad.]

32:22.680 --> 32:25.120
[-You look better.]
[-Praise God.]

32:25.280 --> 32:27.280
[-Anything to drink?]
[-No, thanks.]

32:27.480 --> 32:30.440
[I'm very glad]
[you agreed to see me.]

32:30.600 --> 32:32.760
[How could I say no?]
[Remember, we're one family, Ali.]

32:32.920 --> 32:34.680
[I feel the same way.]

32:34.920 --> 32:36.560
[How was prison?]

32:36.720 --> 32:40.160
[It didn't bother me. It wasn't my
first time and it won't be my last.]

32:40.320 --> 32:43.560
[I don't care about those Jews,
only about my people.]

32:43.720 --> 32:46.600
[People on the street curse me,
spit on me and threaten me.]

32:46.760 --> 32:47.880
[Why? What happened?]

32:48.040 --> 32:51.280
[The Jews are convincing people
that I'm a collaborator,]

32:51.440 --> 32:55.160
[and as you know, our youth
can be easily deceived.]

32:55.320 --> 32:57.160
[They play right
into the Jews' hands.]

32:57.320 --> 32:59.160
[But Ali, it's not only our youth.]

32:59.320 --> 33:01.560
[Your daughter received
expensive treatment.]

33:01.720 --> 33:04.080
[And it wasn't the first
surgery she's undergone.]

33:04.240 --> 33:06.600
[Can they frame me for that?]

33:06.800 --> 33:11.400
[I didn't tell them about the big
attack, about you or anything else.]

33:11.560 --> 33:13.720
[I lead them to places
they can't reach.]

33:13.880 --> 33:17.480
[Do you think I'm a traitor, Abu Ahmad?
I've been clean all my life,]

33:17.640 --> 33:19.160
[all my life, Abu Ahmad.]

33:19.320 --> 33:22.800
[I wouldn't sell myself out
to those bastards, would I?]

33:22.960 --> 33:24.600
[I understand. Calm down.]

33:24.760 --> 33:28.000
[Just tell me what you told them
so that I can prepare for them.]

33:28.160 --> 33:29.240
[I told them nothing.]

33:29.400 --> 33:32.720
[I told them nothing about
the vacant apartment in Nablus]

33:32.880 --> 33:36.960
[nor about the weapon delivery,
three quarters of which they seized.]

33:37.120 --> 33:40.760
[What could I tell them?
Why would I do that?]

33:40.920 --> 33:44.160
[I told them nothing about you
or anyone else.]

33:44.320 --> 33:46.880
[Nothing that could give them
any leads.]

33:47.040 --> 33:49.200
[I've always stayed clean,]

33:49.360 --> 33:53.960
[and now our people are
calling me a thief and a...]

33:54.120 --> 33:55.520
[-...a traitor!]
[-Calm down.]

33:55.680 --> 33:57.960
[They're accusing me of treason,
Abu Ahmad!]

33:58.120 --> 33:58.960
[Calm down, Ali.]

33:59.120 --> 34:02.160
[I appreciate the honesty.
Don't worry.]

34:02.320 --> 34:03.600
[Don't worry.]

34:03.760 --> 34:05.560
[Thank you, Abu Ahmad.]

34:05.720 --> 34:10.200
[If I hadn't met with you now--
You must clear my name, Abu Ahmad.]

34:10.360 --> 34:12.280
[-You know--]
[-Alright.]

34:12.440 --> 34:14.600
[-I really thank you.]
[-Don't worry.]

35:47.040 --> 35:50.160
[We won't let anything hinder
our plan for the big attack.]

35:51.000 --> 35:53.200
[Sure. Sure.]

35:53.360 --> 35:54.840
[God is with you.]

35:55.000 --> 35:56.800
[Thank you, Abu Ahmad.]

36:03.360 --> 36:06.120
[-Can I have a cigarette?]
[-Of course.]

36:42.800 --> 36:45.040
Ashraf, have you spotted
any escapees?

36:47.480 --> 36:49.680
Ashraf, have you spotted
any escapees?

36:53.200 --> 36:55.440
Ashraf, have you spotted
any escapees?

36:56.400 --> 36:58.000
Ashraf?

36:59.760 --> 37:01.400
Boaz?

37:03.280 --> 37:05.040
Boaz?

37:07.320 --> 37:08.760
Boaz?

37:09.280 --> 37:10.920
Boaz!
