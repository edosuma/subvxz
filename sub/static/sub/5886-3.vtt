Heinz beans.
Some things never change.

00:05.459 --> 00:06.665
Oh, it's clever.

00:07.013 --> 00:08.844
We're going to lose
Jaguar unless

00:08.942 --> 00:10.296
an arrangement is made, and

00:10.375 --> 00:11.988
it involves you and her.

00:12.133 --> 00:13.708
You look radiant, Joan.

00:13.840 --> 00:17.205
You must have heard some terrible
things about me from Don Draper.

00:17.312 --> 00:18.839
Now, why would you want to
play for the other team?

00:18.974 --> 00:20.304
It's not a game.

00:20.407 --> 00:22.311
You don't get another chance
at what you have.

00:22.424 --> 00:23.976
I have it all.

Here we go.

01:10.375 --> 01:12.242
The one with the fur.

01:12.277 --> 01:15.145
You know, I might just take you
up on those theater tickets.

01:15.180 --> 01:18.015
- You must see "Hair."
- Oh, you like that?

01:18.049 --> 01:20.818
- Who doesn't?
- What is it?

01:20.853 --> 01:22.687
Oh, it's just filled
with profanity,

01:22.721 --> 01:25.589
marijuana smoking,
and simulated sexual acts.

01:25.623 --> 01:27.256
Simulated?

01:27.291 --> 01:29.158
And a few songs.

01:29.193 --> 01:31.528
The two holiday
chairmanships that remain

01:31.562 --> 01:33.129
are the 4th of July
block party,

01:33.163 --> 01:35.198
which really consists of
calling the fire department,

01:35.232 --> 01:37.100
or the Labor Day
Soap Box Derby,

01:37.134 --> 01:38.802
which consists
of calling the hospital.

01:38.836 --> 01:41.403
Which one do you do?

01:41.437 --> 01:44.439
Our family has claimed
the Easter egg hunt.

01:44.474 --> 01:46.775
Do you dress as a bunny?

01:46.810 --> 01:48.443
Maybe a little cottontail?

01:48.478 --> 01:51.614
It's very wholesome.

01:51.648 --> 01:53.281
Mm-hmm.

01:53.316 --> 01:55.684
I'd like to surprise Doug
for his birthday.

01:55.719 --> 01:58.887
Maybe you could get me
the tickets in secret.

01:58.921 --> 02:00.488
Arrangements could be made.

02:00.523 --> 02:02.089
Just pick a date
and ring me up.

02:04.092 --> 02:06.127
I have to warn you,
I'm from a small town

02:06.161 --> 02:09.797
and all of my forays into
Manhattan have been a disaster.

02:09.832 --> 02:11.265
We'll make a deal.

02:11.299 --> 02:13.099
Brave your way to Grand Central

02:13.134 --> 02:15.368
and I'll hand off the tickets
and throw in a hot dog.

02:15.403 --> 02:16.970
You have another one of those?

02:17.005 --> 02:18.672
But you've already
seen "Hair."

02:18.706 --> 02:21.207
Maybe I want to see it again.

02:25.379 --> 02:27.714
Oh, there you are.

02:27.749 --> 02:30.983
Gentlemen, it's been
a pleasure.

02:31.018 --> 02:33.019
Thank you both
for your hospitality.

02:33.053 --> 02:35.154
- Thank you again.
- It was lovely.

02:37.624 --> 02:39.559
Consider what I said
about the pool.

02:45.397 --> 02:49.467
That is the end
of the welcome wagon.

02:49.501 --> 02:52.737
We'll basically have to move to get
someone to make dinner for us.

02:53.973 --> 02:56.174
What was that about the pool?

02:56.208 --> 02:58.276
He's insistent we all
go skinny-dipping.

02:58.310 --> 03:00.878
Ha! Let him get
his own pool.

03:00.912 --> 03:02.846
Turn it off.

03:12.857 --> 03:15.192
I need to put it in the
mail today and the tailor.

03:15.226 --> 03:18.260
Sylvia, sweetheart--

03:18.295 --> 03:20.296
- Good morning.
- Morning.

03:20.330 --> 03:21.931
Morning.

03:23.133 --> 03:26.268
- Honey.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

03:26.303 --> 03:28.504
I'll swing by
the bank at lunch.

03:37.546 --> 03:39.147
I give her cash every month,

03:39.181 --> 03:41.917
but I think she's secretly
sending it all to our kid.

03:41.951 --> 03:45.053
You don't
have to explain anything.

03:45.088 --> 03:47.188
You're lucky your wife works.

03:47.223 --> 03:48.689
She doesn't earn much.

03:48.724 --> 03:50.591
Not yet.

03:53.261 --> 03:55.029
I forgot my cigarettes.

03:56.798 --> 04:00.334
You got to stop that nonsense.

04:00.368 --> 04:03.370
Listen, don't worry about dinner Wednesday.
We'll have money by then.

04:03.404 --> 04:06.106
Looking forward to it.

04:26.126 --> 04:28.093
I knew it'd be you.

04:28.128 --> 04:30.630
<i>"I've Got Five Dollars"</i>
<i>playing in background</i>

04:38.137 --> 04:41.306
It wasn't all bad.
I got me some memories.

04:41.340 --> 04:42.840
And the boy.

04:42.875 --> 04:44.709
Don't know what it is yet.

04:44.743 --> 04:46.311
I mean Dick here.

04:46.345 --> 04:48.580
Well, hello there.

04:48.614 --> 04:51.349
This is Mack. He's with
me, so he's your uncle.

04:51.384 --> 04:54.718
We thank the Lord for
opening your rooms to us.

04:54.752 --> 04:58.222
All I said was, "My sister's
coming with her boy."

04:58.256 --> 04:59.990
Mack's the one that brung ya.

05:00.024 --> 05:01.792
I'd do the same for mine.

05:01.826 --> 05:03.394
And, of course,
Ernestine told you

05:03.428 --> 05:05.563
we could always use
a little help around here.

05:08.900 --> 05:10.333
Let's get you off your feet.

05:10.367 --> 05:13.403
Dick, you help Mack
with the bags.

05:15.739 --> 05:18.308
You keep your eyes down and
mind your own business here.

05:22.779 --> 05:25.314
Good-looking kid.
He yours?

05:25.348 --> 05:27.282
Not that I know.

05:27.317 --> 05:30.051
Little boy, find your own sins.

05:30.086 --> 05:32.153
Stay away from Mack's.

05:33.989 --> 05:36.057
Afternoon, Charlotte.

05:39.662 --> 05:42.496
Hey, kid, you were raised
on a farm, am I right?

05:42.531 --> 05:44.131
Yes, sir.

05:44.165 --> 05:46.900
Well, I'm the rooster
around here, understand?

05:46.935 --> 05:48.736
You help all the hens?

05:48.770 --> 05:51.405
And I'll bring on the day.

06:03.451 --> 06:05.619
I feel bad.

06:05.653 --> 06:07.687
You should.
I have to go to work.

06:07.722 --> 06:09.522
You get to sleep.

06:09.557 --> 06:11.992
No, about dinner.

06:18.565 --> 06:20.499
I thought there was no smoking.

06:20.533 --> 06:22.769
I just found out
the maid smokes.

06:29.409 --> 06:32.010
She doesn't sleep
in here, does she?

06:36.182 --> 06:38.316
You don't mind sitting
across the table

06:38.350 --> 06:40.285
from your wife and my husband?

06:40.319 --> 06:42.254
I don't think about it.

06:43.455 --> 06:45.556
They're both good company.

06:47.358 --> 06:49.860
They are.

06:49.895 --> 06:52.863
I suppose that has
nothing to do with this.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.835
This didn't happen.

06:59.171 --> 07:01.571
Just in here.

07:03.107 --> 07:04.541
You're right.

07:08.513 --> 07:11.181
I only said yes because
Arnold wants to impress you.

07:11.215 --> 07:13.817
I only said yes because
Megan keeps asking.

07:13.851 --> 07:16.753
- She likes you.
- And I like her.

07:27.364 --> 07:29.998
It's 9:00.
I have to go.

07:30.033 --> 07:32.501
You love to go.

07:36.305 --> 07:40.675
Well, it's nice to know
that no matter what

07:40.710 --> 07:43.211
we got something done today.

07:52.086 --> 07:54.355
You found it in the cookie jar.

07:56.324 --> 07:59.125
I have money,
I just never <i>have</i> money.

08:06.367 --> 08:09.001
Mr. Mathis and Mr. Gifford
are waiting outside.

08:09.035 --> 08:10.470
Why didn't you tell me?

08:12.873 --> 08:14.574
Because they don't
want to come in.

08:15.909 --> 08:18.544
Look, Phyllis,
I've had their job.

08:18.579 --> 08:20.847
I know. And you've
had my job, too.

08:20.881 --> 08:24.583
So you know it wouldn't hurt
if you were to act like--

08:24.617 --> 08:28.620
if you were as encouraging
to them as you are to me.

08:28.654 --> 08:30.489
Why don't you just get me
whatever book you read

08:30.523 --> 08:31.857
and save me
these little lectures?

08:31.891 --> 08:33.692
More coffee?

08:37.129 --> 08:39.129
She's ready for you.

08:42.433 --> 08:43.801
Have a seat.

08:45.404 --> 08:48.873
- No, don't.
- What's wrong with them?

08:48.907 --> 08:51.542
The strategy is Clearasil
stops blemishes

08:51.576 --> 08:53.076
that keep you from having fun.

08:53.111 --> 08:55.712
That means no one
should be having fun.

08:55.746 --> 08:57.447
Okay.

08:57.481 --> 08:59.649
So we'll just start over.

09:00.651 --> 09:03.386
Just a minute.

09:05.355 --> 09:07.690
I don't want you to think
that just because

09:07.725 --> 09:09.692
I have high standards

09:09.727 --> 09:12.428
that means I'm not happy
with you.

09:12.462 --> 09:16.064
Especially, you know,
the way you are.

09:18.334 --> 09:20.101
The way you are
has nothing to do

09:20.136 --> 09:22.805
with the fact
that the work needs work.

09:24.340 --> 09:26.908
Thank you, Coach.
We'll try our best.

09:26.942 --> 09:28.776
There you go.

09:42.858 --> 09:45.960
Please, dear,
don't linger in the hallway.

09:50.965 --> 09:52.766
Your coat?

09:59.774 --> 10:01.240
Can I get you something to eat?

10:01.275 --> 10:03.677
I think I have some peanuts
and some cheese crackers.

10:03.711 --> 10:05.812
No, thank you.

10:05.847 --> 10:07.780
Perhaps something to drink?

10:07.814 --> 10:10.449
I have bourbon, vodka,

10:10.484 --> 10:12.384
gin, champagne.

10:12.418 --> 10:14.353
I shouldn't.
I started on the train.

10:14.387 --> 10:17.422
What kind of music do you like?

10:17.457 --> 10:19.558
None for me.

10:23.295 --> 10:25.262
Is the temperature okay?

10:26.298 --> 10:28.900
Yes.

10:28.934 --> 10:31.135
Hmm.

10:31.169 --> 10:33.872
It's been known to get hot.

10:33.906 --> 10:37.274
I'm fine.

10:37.309 --> 10:39.243
That's a pretty shade
of lipstick.

10:41.079 --> 10:42.579
Thank you.

10:47.285 --> 10:49.186
I'm glad you came.

11:08.906 --> 11:10.373
Come with me.

11:19.349 --> 11:21.616
DDB managed to get me
on the 50-yard line

11:21.651 --> 11:23.118
for the Giants game
last November.

11:23.153 --> 11:25.654
If we'd done it,
the Steelers would have won.

11:25.688 --> 11:28.722
We'd do anything to make you happy.

11:28.757 --> 11:30.858
I'm not unhappy with DDB.

11:30.892 --> 11:32.793
No notes.

11:32.827 --> 11:35.596
When I presented the numbers
for my division,

11:35.630 --> 11:39.400
Timmy came up to me and said,
"How the hell did you do that?"

11:39.435 --> 11:41.502
So I figured he's in town,

11:41.537 --> 11:44.137
why not take him
to the horse's mouth?

11:44.172 --> 11:45.838
The past few years,

11:45.873 --> 11:48.108
I've overseen ketchup
to great success.

11:48.142 --> 11:50.310
But how long before
we're old news?

11:50.344 --> 11:53.580
And, hell, when I saw baked beans
have a sales spike like that...

11:53.614 --> 11:56.149
Raymond has demanded
our best work.

11:56.184 --> 11:58.918
So then the question is
what can we do for you?

11:58.953 --> 12:00.519
What can we do for ketchup?

12:01.788 --> 12:03.055
Let me know.

12:07.294 --> 12:08.860
A pleasure to meet you, Timmy.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.296
This isn't an official visit.

12:10.330 --> 12:12.498
I'm just dropping by.

12:12.532 --> 12:15.866
Ken, Don and I have a little beans
housekeeping, if you don't mind.

12:15.901 --> 12:18.570
I'd love to walk you out.

12:21.307 --> 12:24.175
Raymond, we're grateful
for this opportunity

12:24.210 --> 12:26.611
and consider it
quite a vote of confidence.

12:26.645 --> 12:29.481
It is, but I don't want you
to waste your time.

12:31.149 --> 12:33.950
Well, then if nothing else,
we appreciate the introduction.

12:33.985 --> 12:35.452
I'm not winking here.

12:35.487 --> 12:37.554
There is to be
no further communication

12:37.589 --> 12:39.523
with Timmy or his division.

12:39.557 --> 12:41.992
I'm sorry, Raymond. Did we
do something to upset you?

12:42.026 --> 12:44.628
You guys are doing
a bang-up job.

12:44.662 --> 12:47.396
And now that polished Polack
wants the same.

12:47.431 --> 12:49.265
I'll take that drink.

12:49.299 --> 12:53.169
No one's paid attention to me
in nine years at the company.

12:53.203 --> 12:55.104
They gave me a suicide mission.

12:55.139 --> 12:57.740
Vinegar, sauces,
and baked beans.

12:57.774 --> 13:00.276
And then in my moment
of triumph, he comes up to me

13:00.310 --> 13:02.178
and he didn't say,
"How did you do that?"

13:02.212 --> 13:03.878
He said,
"How did <i>you</i> do <i>that?"</i>

13:03.912 --> 13:06.348
<i>Smug bastard.</i>

13:06.382 --> 13:07.915
I taught him
everything he knows.

13:07.950 --> 13:10.918
- We understand, Raymond.
- No, forget it.

13:10.953 --> 13:13.522
I know ketchup's
the gold standard,

13:13.556 --> 13:16.324
but after all we've been through,
I'm sure I don't need to tell you

13:16.359 --> 13:19.627
that if you so much as send
him a ham at Christmas,

13:19.661 --> 13:23.197
well, I'd rather retire

13:23.231 --> 13:25.499
than watch that guy
screw my girlfriend.

13:26.701 --> 13:28.802
- Let me walk you out.
- No.

13:28.836 --> 13:30.971
If he lingered at all,

13:31.005 --> 13:33.240
I'm gonna pretend I'm on
my way to the men's room.

13:37.110 --> 13:39.245
I'm sorry.
What a waste of time.

13:39.280 --> 13:41.047
I don't know.
We met Timmy.

13:41.081 --> 13:43.916
- He's certainly going places.
- Raymond's so weak.

13:43.950 --> 13:46.986
But he brought his business here
when we were barely standing.

13:47.020 --> 13:49.455
It's Heinz Ketchup, Don.

13:49.490 --> 13:51.956
It's the Coca-Cola
of condiments.

13:51.991 --> 13:53.792
I know.

13:53.826 --> 13:56.595
But sometimes you've got to dance
with the one that brung ya.

14:00.900 --> 14:03.702
I'm afraid that's the end
of your toilet paper.

14:03.736 --> 14:06.405
This place could really use
a woman's touch.

14:06.439 --> 14:08.138
You think so?

14:08.173 --> 14:10.474
I might come to town Friday.

14:10.509 --> 14:12.710
There's always
a sale at Macy's.

14:12.744 --> 14:14.745
We'll see.

14:14.779 --> 14:18.482
Okay, I'll call you.

14:18.517 --> 14:21.452
If I let the phone ring once and
hang up, then you'll know it's me.

14:21.486 --> 14:23.120
Don't do that.

14:23.154 --> 14:25.889
Well, I'm going to park my car

14:25.924 --> 14:28.425
in front of the driveway
instead of in the driveway.

14:28.459 --> 14:30.493
Then you'll know
I'm thinking of you.

14:35.333 --> 14:37.735
That's sweet.

14:37.769 --> 14:39.402
I really have to get back.

14:39.437 --> 14:41.403
Can you move it along a little?

14:44.563 --> 14:46.597
You told me you were
washing these by hand.

14:46.632 --> 14:49.466
- No wonder the elastic is shot.
- I forgot.

14:49.501 --> 14:51.301
And you forgot you left
the vacuum on the terrace.

14:51.336 --> 14:52.802
I was changing the bag.

14:52.837 --> 14:55.372
And you forgot not to use
S.O.S on the Teflon.

14:55.407 --> 14:57.241
I mean, I leave
for work every day

14:57.275 --> 14:59.476
and I wonder what you're
going to ruin in my house.

14:59.511 --> 15:02.246
I'm so sorry,
Mrs. Draper.

15:05.482 --> 15:08.284
I don't know how to do
this, but you're fired.

15:09.586 --> 15:12.021
I'll get my things.

15:16.393 --> 15:18.361
- I'm sorry.
- No.

15:18.395 --> 15:21.463
I am. I walked in on it and
then I didn't want to pretend.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.601
Are you okay, honey?

15:26.635 --> 15:28.603
No.

15:34.243 --> 15:36.044
Come on.
Let's go upstairs.

15:36.045 --> 15:38.019
I don't wanna go
up until she's gone.

15:38.020 --> 15:39.637
Let her alone
with your silverware?

15:39.681 --> 15:44.718
So, after weeks, I finally showed him
the picture of my mother...

15:44.786 --> 15:48.755
but that's not enough, because
her name has been changed in the will.

15:48.790 --> 15:51.092
That is quite a story line.

15:51.126 --> 15:53.693
Well, you asked.

15:53.694 --> 15:56.563
- It's meaty, isn't it?
- It is.

15:56.597 --> 15:58.431
I just wish watching TV
during the day

15:58.466 --> 16:00.633
didn't make me feel so guilty.

16:04.505 --> 16:06.306
I had a miscarriage.

16:06.340 --> 16:09.408
All right.
I will watch.

16:10.977 --> 16:13.945
No, in real life.

16:13.946 --> 16:16.094
Two days ago.

16:21.488 --> 16:23.489
I'm so sorry to hear that.

16:23.523 --> 16:26.124
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
burden you with this.

16:26.158 --> 16:28.959
No, you obviously need to talk.

16:30.229 --> 16:33.864
I was sloppy
in Hawaii--

16:35.066 --> 16:37.968
the time difference, vacation.

16:39.671 --> 16:41.972
Now I feel so guilty.

16:43.274 --> 16:44.574
May I?

16:46.544 --> 16:49.178
What do you have
to feel guilty about?

16:55.653 --> 16:57.153
What did Don say?

16:58.522 --> 17:01.257
I didn't tell him.

17:01.291 --> 17:03.558
It's been a hard
couple of weeks.

17:04.761 --> 17:06.795
Oh.

17:06.829 --> 17:09.665
I don't know why.

17:09.699 --> 17:12.701
I mean, I do.

17:14.170 --> 17:17.806
You were raised
the same way I was.

17:17.839 --> 17:21.407
I keep hearing
Sister Eugenie in my head.

17:21.442 --> 17:23.877
I'm such a horrible person.

17:26.214 --> 17:29.116
You're not a horrible person.

17:29.151 --> 17:31.485
No, I am.

17:33.188 --> 17:35.955
I mean,

17:35.990 --> 17:38.291
to be pregnant now

17:38.325 --> 17:40.326
at this moment?

17:41.796 --> 17:43.730
I didn't know
what I wanted to do

17:43.764 --> 17:47.067
and I was so relieved that I
didn't have to do anything.

17:49.369 --> 17:50.969
I see.

17:51.004 --> 17:53.605
Has this ever happened to you?

17:55.608 --> 17:58.043
About a year after
I had Mitchell.

17:59.913 --> 18:03.281
So I certainly understand
some of what you're feeling.

18:05.518 --> 18:08.686
But the rest of it,

18:08.721 --> 18:10.421
no.

18:10.455 --> 18:11.989
I'm sorry.

18:12.024 --> 18:14.325
Really?

18:14.359 --> 18:15.927
Because I was raised
the same way,

18:15.961 --> 18:20.031
so I would never even
consider that my decision.

18:20.065 --> 18:22.466
You really believe that?

18:22.500 --> 18:24.667
I do.

18:24.702 --> 18:27.303
And I think you do, too,

18:27.338 --> 18:29.106
or you wouldn't feel this way.

18:32.844 --> 18:35.411
I just feel so shitty.

18:36.748 --> 18:38.848
I'm sorry I brought it up.

18:45.722 --> 18:47.422
Hello.

18:48.424 --> 18:50.059
Hello.

18:50.093 --> 18:53.062
- Sylvia's here.
- I see that.

18:53.096 --> 18:55.429
Hello.

19:03.272 --> 19:04.739
I should be going.

19:04.774 --> 19:08.276
You don't have to rush off.

19:08.310 --> 19:11.678
- <i>Have a drink.</i>
- No, I'll leave you two alone.

19:17.152 --> 19:19.987
- I fired the maid today.
- Good riddance.

19:20.021 --> 19:21.889
Good night, both of you.

19:21.923 --> 19:23.590
See you tomorrow.

19:23.624 --> 19:26.426
- Excuse me?
- For dinner.

19:26.460 --> 19:29.262
Oh, of course.

19:29.296 --> 19:30.496
Yes.

19:46.913 --> 19:49.514
So send her in.

19:49.548 --> 19:51.950
Sorry to bother you,
but this was on my desk.

19:51.984 --> 19:53.484
Is it new?

19:53.519 --> 19:55.120
There's usually a memo
for everything around here.

19:55.154 --> 19:57.322
- What is it?
- It's Quest.

19:57.356 --> 20:01.192
Feminine hygiene powder.

20:01.226 --> 20:03.727
- Did I miss a meeting?
- "Proof points--

20:03.761 --> 20:06.931
has baking soda, makes you
nicer if you're stinky,

20:06.965 --> 20:09.499
kills overly
critical bacteria."

20:12.337 --> 20:15.239
"Target-- professional
women and other Olsons."

20:16.708 --> 20:18.208
Just give it to me.

20:18.242 --> 20:19.810
Calm down.

20:19.844 --> 20:21.545
I think this is somebody's
idea of a joke.

20:21.579 --> 20:23.814
Of course, when you want them
to be funny they're useless.

20:29.654 --> 20:31.487
Hello, gorgeous.

20:34.924 --> 20:36.826
Hello, Herb.

20:38.127 --> 20:40.128
Did you get
all gussied up for me?

20:40.163 --> 20:41.831
No.

20:41.865 --> 20:44.467
I had no idea you'd be
darkening my doorway.

20:44.501 --> 20:47.435
When are you gonna
come out to the lot?

20:47.470 --> 20:50.505
I told you, I'll let you have a
Jaguar for as long as you like.

20:50.539 --> 20:52.240
I take the bus.

20:52.274 --> 20:55.343
I know there's a part of you
that's glad to see me.

20:55.378 --> 20:58.780
And I know there's a part of
you you haven't seen in years.

20:58.814 --> 21:01.249
Herb!
There you are.

21:01.283 --> 21:02.884
How are you today?

21:02.918 --> 21:04.718
Toodle-oo.

21:09.557 --> 21:11.592
<i>Mrs. Harris
is here to see you.</i>

21:11.626 --> 21:13.527
He's here.

21:35.148 --> 21:37.148
Thank you.

21:37.182 --> 21:39.384
- Who are you?
- I'm Bob Benson.

21:39.419 --> 21:41.420
We've met before.
I'm part of the team.

21:43.122 --> 21:44.923
Doesn't the elevator
go up to this floor?

21:46.191 --> 21:48.026
Herb.

21:48.060 --> 21:49.628
What brings you by?

21:49.662 --> 21:52.362
I had some thoughts,
the complexity of which

21:52.397 --> 21:54.197
could not be expressed
over a telephone.

21:54.232 --> 21:55.766
What is it you want?

21:55.801 --> 21:58.469
Well, you guys are gonna
make some fancy-schmancy

21:58.503 --> 22:00.538
Michelangelo TV spot
and the dealers

22:00.572 --> 22:02.272
are gonna foot most of
the bill for running it.

22:02.307 --> 22:04.241
That's how it works.

22:04.275 --> 22:07.077
Well, I'm the only guy actually
out there selling hamburgers

22:07.111 --> 22:10.313
and I want people to know there's
a hamburger store in Englewood,

22:10.347 --> 22:12.782
not England or in your mind.

22:12.817 --> 22:16.018
I don't want another thing with some
shmuck sitting on his lawn mower

22:16.053 --> 22:19.556
fantasizing that he's gonna win
the Grand Prix driving a Jaguar.

22:19.590 --> 22:21.357
I need foot traffic.

22:21.391 --> 22:23.225
Get 'em in the door
so I can move metal.

22:23.260 --> 22:26.595
Well, you, along with
the factory guys,

22:26.629 --> 22:29.264
have already signed off on
the work as well as the buy.

22:29.298 --> 22:32.400
I just think there should
be retail radio as well.

22:32.435 --> 22:35.737
You know? "Does your
car sound like this?"

22:35.772 --> 22:38.507
Voom voom! "Does your
wife sound like this?"

22:38.541 --> 22:40.107
"Ooh, I love your car."

22:40.141 --> 22:42.977
And then you say
the phone number twice.

22:43.011 --> 22:44.612
Wonderful.

22:44.646 --> 22:46.881
We'd love to increase
the exposure of the campaign.

22:46.915 --> 22:48.516
How much more
would you like to buy?

22:48.550 --> 22:52.487
There's no increase.
Just adjust the proportions.

22:52.521 --> 22:54.622
I think we should spend
60% of the money

22:54.656 --> 22:57.791
on local dealership ads
instead of national.

22:57.825 --> 23:01.595
Herb, that would really take a
bite out of the national campaign.

23:01.629 --> 23:03.797
Well, if you say so.

23:03.831 --> 23:06.199
Unfortunately,
it's not up to me,

23:06.233 --> 23:08.334
so I am suggesting

23:08.369 --> 23:11.471
that you recommend
this plan to all of us.

23:11.505 --> 23:13.772
Why don't you recommend it?
It's your idea.

23:13.807 --> 23:17.175
Because it's an idea
you had yourself.

23:18.778 --> 23:21.747
And Lord knows
you're so damn persuasive.

23:21.781 --> 23:24.016
We understand, Herb.

23:24.050 --> 23:26.018
See how easy that was, Bob?

23:29.955 --> 23:32.690
Bob, why don't you
show me the sights?

23:32.725 --> 23:35.527
You must be like a kid
in a candy store around here.

23:40.833 --> 23:43.534
- You can't shake his hand?
- He didn't seem interested.

23:43.568 --> 23:46.737
In fact, the only thing he seemed interested
in was gutting our national campaign.

23:46.771 --> 23:49.439
You do realize that defeats
the purpose of having Jaguar?

23:49.473 --> 23:51.875
So he's demanding
and unreasonable.

23:51.910 --> 23:55.378
How does that make him different from the
other people who walk through that door?

23:55.413 --> 23:58.415
I wish you would handle the clients
as well as you're handling me.

24:04.914 --> 24:07.682
<i>Jimmy's Condom Warehouse</i>

24:07.716 --> 24:09.651
<i>where the rubber meets the road.
Jimmy speaking.</i>

24:09.685 --> 24:11.952
You want a drink?

24:11.987 --> 24:15.122
No, thank you.
I'm quite comfortable.

24:15.157 --> 24:18.326
<i>How was your day, honey?</i>

24:19.562 --> 24:20.861
Okay.

24:20.896 --> 24:23.763
Okay?
What happened to Shangri-La?

24:23.798 --> 24:25.999
Chaough quit crapping out
snow cones?

24:26.033 --> 24:29.169
Everyone hates me here.

24:29.204 --> 24:30.804
Well, that was bound to happen.

24:30.838 --> 24:34.274
You worked for me
and you like me.

24:34.309 --> 24:37.411
- I worked with you.
- I was tough but fair.

24:37.445 --> 24:39.245
<i>Oh, speaking of people</i>
<i>who hate you,</i>

24:39.279 --> 24:41.480
<i>Raymond J. Beans came in today</i>
<i>and pulled a real boner.</i>

24:41.515 --> 24:43.015
Go on.

24:43.049 --> 24:44.483
He brought in
the head of ketchup.

24:44.518 --> 24:46.752
He's obsessed with that man.

24:46.786 --> 24:48.254
Yeah, he should be.
I met him.

24:48.288 --> 24:50.323
So Raymond makes
the introduction

24:50.357 --> 24:53.192
and then, according to Ken, ketchup
leaves, but Raymond lingers

24:53.227 --> 24:55.527
and he says he's gonna
kill the account and himself

24:55.561 --> 24:57.161
if they even talk
to ketchup again.

24:57.196 --> 24:59.197
Why'd he bring him in?

24:59.232 --> 25:02.500
Because he's Raymond.
He's a fraidycat.

25:02.535 --> 25:05.470
And-- here's the part
that's gonna make you happy--

25:05.504 --> 25:07.872
Kenny spent two weeks
telling everybody

25:07.906 --> 25:09.407
how he was getting ketchup.

25:14.512 --> 25:17.080
Okay, Tuesday morning
is perfect.

25:17.115 --> 25:19.650
<i>What? Oh, yep.</i>

25:19.684 --> 25:22.018
<i>We'll have your wig</i>
<i>ready then, ma'am.</i>

25:24.822 --> 25:26.857
You're allowed to make
personal calls after 5:00,

25:26.891 --> 25:28.424
especially if they
make you laugh.

25:28.459 --> 25:30.826
My friend Stan was
telling me a funny story

25:30.861 --> 25:33.429
- about one of our old clients.
- What happened?

25:33.464 --> 25:37.233
Oh, it's complicated, but basically
the guy from Heinz Baked Beans

25:37.268 --> 25:38.801
hates the guy at Heinz Ketchup.

25:38.835 --> 25:40.370
Of course he does.

25:40.404 --> 25:43.305
Well, surprisingly,
beans brought ketchup in

25:43.339 --> 25:45.707
for a meeting at the agency
and everyone got excited,

25:45.742 --> 25:49.077
and then unsurprisingly
he sent ketchup out of the room

25:49.111 --> 25:50.679
and told everyone
it was just for show.

25:50.713 --> 25:52.781
So he's unhappy?

25:52.815 --> 25:55.183
He's not going anywhere.

25:55.217 --> 25:56.885
Probably misses you.

25:56.919 --> 25:58.553
No.

25:58.588 --> 26:00.488
I assure you, he doesn't.

26:03.158 --> 26:06.160
There's nothing like things going
badly when you leave, is there?

26:10.832 --> 26:12.366
Sorry I'm late.

26:12.401 --> 26:14.234
3rd Avenue was a parking lot.

26:16.103 --> 26:18.438
I'm not feeling well.

26:21.375 --> 26:23.410
That's not where it hurts.

26:23.444 --> 26:25.512
Oh.
Did you cancel?

26:25.546 --> 26:28.648
No, I thought I'd feel better
by the time you got home.

26:28.683 --> 26:30.850
We're supposed to be there
in 15 minutes.

26:30.884 --> 26:32.418
They're probably already there.

26:32.452 --> 26:35.487
I know, but I don't
want to pretend

26:35.522 --> 26:38.524
like I'm having a good time
and it's too late to cancel.

26:38.558 --> 26:41.993
- They'll survive.
- I want you to go.

26:42.028 --> 26:44.229
I want you to have fun.

26:46.766 --> 26:49.367
Okay.

26:49.401 --> 26:51.101
But you go right to bed.

26:51.136 --> 26:53.137
Yes, sir.

27:07.485 --> 27:09.586
<i>Go away!</i>

27:09.620 --> 27:11.488
<i>Somebody help me!</i>

27:11.522 --> 27:13.724
What on earth is that?

27:13.758 --> 27:16.226
<i>Somebody, please!</i>

27:18.095 --> 27:20.295
<i>Somebody help!</i>

27:22.833 --> 27:25.634
- Oh, my goodness!
- What happened to you?

27:25.669 --> 27:29.638
<i>Hey, Campbell,</i>
<i>she's your problem now.</i>

27:29.673 --> 27:31.940
I'm sorry. I didn't
know where else to go.

27:31.975 --> 27:34.543
- He was chasing me.
- Close the door.

27:34.578 --> 27:36.277
Hold this to your nose.

27:36.311 --> 27:37.912
What the hell happened?

27:37.946 --> 27:39.947
I'm so embarrassed.

27:41.484 --> 27:43.451
We had a terrible fight.

27:43.486 --> 27:46.521
- I'm going to call the authorities.
- No, please.

27:46.555 --> 27:48.390
Well, then I'm taking you
to the hospital.

27:48.424 --> 27:50.525
- I'll be fine.
- No, what do you think you're doing?

27:50.559 --> 27:52.959
You're not going back there.
Peter, go to Tammy's bathroom.

27:52.994 --> 27:54.828
There's some cotton wool.

27:57.432 --> 27:59.032
I'll be right back.

28:01.569 --> 28:03.069
I hope you haven't
been waiting long.

28:03.104 --> 28:05.071
Oh, don't worry about it.
I was late, too.

28:05.106 --> 28:07.607
They already gave us
a hard time.

28:07.641 --> 28:09.842
- Where's your wife? - She sends her
regrets. She wasn't feeling well.

28:09.877 --> 28:12.745
- That's too bad.
- You look lovely.

28:12.780 --> 28:15.014
Let's get you a drink.

28:15.048 --> 28:17.750
We'll get the waiter
to do the whole show again.

28:17.785 --> 28:20.052
I'm afraid there's only
going to be three of us.

28:20.086 --> 28:21.621
- Don?
- Old-fashioned, please.

28:21.655 --> 28:23.088
<i>Subito.</i>

28:24.624 --> 28:26.792
Well, the North Koreans
really took that ship.

28:26.826 --> 28:29.093
And the Vietcong, did you see
them storming the embassy?

28:29.128 --> 28:30.995
I haven't followed it today.

28:31.030 --> 28:32.997
- We got it back.
- Still...

28:33.032 --> 28:35.300
these two little pissant countries
handing our head to us.

28:35.334 --> 28:37.736
Well, I don't know
about the ship,

28:37.770 --> 28:40.438
but from what I've read, the embassy was
an ambush that broke the cease-fire.

28:40.472 --> 28:42.973
We gave them peace
for their sacred holiday.

28:43.007 --> 28:46.410
Next thing we know,
they cut us to ribbons.

28:46.445 --> 28:47.912
Reminds me of Cuba.

28:47.946 --> 28:50.314
No one took
Fidel Castro seriously.

28:50.348 --> 28:52.282
We thought he was Señor Wences.

28:52.317 --> 28:54.518
Turns out he was
George Washington.

28:55.853 --> 28:57.487
And they say surgeons
are arrogant.

28:57.521 --> 28:58.988
Who says that?

28:59.022 --> 29:01.458
You know we're losing the war.

29:03.026 --> 29:05.562
Wouldn't know it
from looking around here.

29:05.596 --> 29:08.064
Yeah, it's something, right?

29:08.098 --> 29:11.434
- You are Dr. Rosen?
- You see this service?

29:11.468 --> 29:14.002
Yes. We'd like to hear
the spiel again.

29:14.036 --> 29:16.839
Uh, <i>scusi.</i>
There is a telephone call.

29:16.873 --> 29:18.974
Really?

29:19.008 --> 29:20.976
I'll be right back.

29:21.010 --> 29:24.112
I'm gonna take this as an
opportunity to powder my nose.

29:46.634 --> 29:49.636
There's no answer.

29:49.670 --> 29:52.171
Is there anyone else?
Family?

29:52.206 --> 29:54.173
My sister's back in Oneonta.

29:54.208 --> 29:57.010
My mother's in Boca Raton.

29:57.044 --> 30:00.813
Well, you can't go home.
We should find a hotel.

30:05.018 --> 30:06.351
Let's try some ice.

30:13.994 --> 30:15.793
What did you say to him?

30:16.929 --> 30:18.563
Hello? Yes.

30:18.597 --> 30:20.164
Do you have any
vacancies this evening?

30:20.198 --> 30:22.834
Take me to the city.
I want to be with you.

30:22.868 --> 30:25.503
Absolutely not.

30:25.538 --> 30:28.105
Very good.
Thank you.

30:28.140 --> 30:30.542
The Old Greenwich has rooms.

30:30.576 --> 30:33.343
- Can you take me there?
- We'll get you a taxi.

30:33.377 --> 30:35.311
Nonsense.
I'll drive you.

30:35.346 --> 30:38.481
I don't know what I was thinking.
I'll run you over.

30:38.516 --> 30:41.652
Brenda, dear, let's go.
It's best this way.

30:54.467 --> 30:56.234
Emergency averted?

30:56.269 --> 30:57.736
Unfortunately, no.

30:57.771 --> 30:59.304
Sylvia and you
are having dinner.

30:59.338 --> 31:01.439
- This is silly.
- We can do this another time.

31:01.473 --> 31:03.974
I'm not taking my foot out of
the door of this restaurant.

31:04.009 --> 31:06.310
Order for four
or they'll punish me.

31:07.446 --> 31:09.414
Good luck.

31:15.120 --> 31:16.687
What are you having?

31:16.722 --> 31:18.755
I don't know
that I'm that hungry.

31:20.792 --> 31:23.627
You want another glass of wine?
Should we get a bottle?

31:23.661 --> 31:25.662
You're drinking something else.

31:25.696 --> 31:27.964
I don't want you to have wine
if you don't drink wine.

31:27.998 --> 31:29.833
I'm not gonna drink
a whole bottle, obviously.

31:29.867 --> 31:32.402
I don't know
how obvious that is.

31:32.437 --> 31:34.403
Another glass is fine.

31:35.739 --> 31:37.573
So what looks good here?

31:37.607 --> 31:40.409
Depends what you want.

31:40.444 --> 31:43.579
Well, I'm hungry,
I'm in a good mood,

31:43.613 --> 31:47.650
and I'd like some guidance on the
Italian menu from my favorite Italian.

31:47.684 --> 31:50.819
I didn't cook it, so I can't
speak to its quality.

31:53.355 --> 31:56.591
You think I'd like
eggplant rollatinis?

31:56.625 --> 31:58.760
For the lovely signora?

31:58.794 --> 32:00.628
- We're not ready yet.
- Yes, we are.

32:00.663 --> 32:02.296
Can she have
another glass of wine

32:02.331 --> 32:03.765
and could you give us a minute?

32:03.799 --> 32:05.599
<i>Certo.</i>

32:10.672 --> 32:12.205
What's wrong?

32:12.239 --> 32:14.441
How could I possibly know
what you like to eat?

32:14.476 --> 32:16.276
I thought you were
looking forward to this.

32:16.310 --> 32:18.278
I don't know what we're doing.

32:18.312 --> 32:20.681
We're having dinner together.

32:20.715 --> 32:23.282
And I'm sorry, but I guess
it was a stupid idea to think

32:23.316 --> 32:26.118
we could spend time together
outside of your maid's room.

32:27.654 --> 32:29.288
Just because they cleared
their place settings

32:29.322 --> 32:31.190
doesn't mean we're alone.

32:31.224 --> 32:32.825
Is that what's bothering you?

32:32.860 --> 32:35.160
That everything
worked out perfectly?

32:35.195 --> 32:37.262
And you enjoy how foolish
they both look.

32:39.532 --> 32:41.299
Now I understand.

32:44.971 --> 32:47.171
You want to feel shitty

32:47.206 --> 32:50.074
right up until the point
where I take your dress off.

32:55.246 --> 32:57.247
Because I'm going to do that.

32:57.281 --> 33:01.051
You want to skip dinner?
Fine. But don't pretend.

33:01.085 --> 33:04.488
<i>"Casta Diva - Norma</i>
<i>1st Act" playing</i>

33:07.993 --> 33:11.160
And what if she had come?

33:11.194 --> 33:12.962
The evening would be
just the same,

33:12.997 --> 33:14.731
only it would be
someone else's dress?

33:17.668 --> 33:20.036
What are you talking about?

33:20.070 --> 33:23.506
Weren't you the one who told
me you were drifting apart?

33:23.541 --> 33:25.541
Isn't that what this was about?

33:25.575 --> 33:27.375
I want you.

33:27.410 --> 33:31.346
<i>I want you all the time.</i>

33:31.380 --> 33:33.682
But if you've suddenly decided you
want something more than that,

33:33.716 --> 33:35.984
well, then,
that's news, isn't it?

33:38.588 --> 33:40.789
So, have you decided?

33:42.323 --> 33:45.392
I don't know.
Have you?

33:49.364 --> 33:51.666
He'll have the steak diavolo

33:51.700 --> 33:53.868
and I'll have the branzino.

33:53.902 --> 33:55.703
Anything to start?

33:55.737 --> 33:58.304
No. We're in a bit of a hurry.

34:04.679 --> 34:06.580
I'm sorry.

34:06.614 --> 34:09.181
I'm so sorry.

34:09.216 --> 34:12.018
I have no right to be jealous.

34:12.053 --> 34:14.351
This is just us here tonight.

34:17.356 --> 34:20.993
We have to be careful.
We can't fall in love.

34:21.027 --> 34:23.360
It won't be so French anymore.

34:35.239 --> 34:37.007
Hi, this is Johnny Carson.
As you know,

34:37.042 --> 34:39.409
this is the usual starting time
for "The Tonight Show."

34:39.444 --> 34:42.981
<i>And tonight my guest is the New Orleans
district attorney Mr. Jim Garrison,</i>

34:43.014 --> 34:44.882
<i>who is with us to discuss,</i>
<i>as he puts it,</i>

34:44.917 --> 34:48.150
some new and vital information
concerning the Kennedy assassination.

34:48.185 --> 34:51.554
But because of the critical
war situation in Vietnam,

34:51.589 --> 34:54.791
especially around Saigon,
NBC for the next 15 minutes

34:54.826 --> 34:57.861
<i>is going to bring you a special
news program via satellite.</i>

34:57.895 --> 34:59.863
So stay with us.
We'll return in 15 minutes

34:59.897 --> 35:01.931
with our guest
Mr. Garrison.

35:28.223 --> 35:30.158
Did you have fun?

35:30.192 --> 35:31.993
Arnold had an emergency,

35:32.028 --> 35:33.661
so Sylvia and I
had to eat enough

35:33.695 --> 35:36.797
to keep him
in good graces there.

35:36.831 --> 35:38.799
Are you feeling better?

35:40.769 --> 35:42.469
I need to talk to you.

35:48.309 --> 35:50.409
What's wrong?

35:50.443 --> 35:52.244
Um...

35:54.347 --> 35:57.216
Well, I had a miscarriage

35:57.250 --> 35:59.318
a few days ago.

36:07.326 --> 36:09.127
Are you okay?

36:09.162 --> 36:10.862
Did you go to the doctor?

36:10.897 --> 36:12.898
Yes.

36:12.932 --> 36:14.866
How far along were you?

36:14.901 --> 36:16.534
Six weeks.

36:18.270 --> 36:20.405
I wish you would have told me.

36:22.841 --> 36:25.776
I guess I didn't know
how you'd feel.

36:25.811 --> 36:27.644
I didn't know what you'd want.

36:29.314 --> 36:33.217
Megan, you have to know
I'd want what you want.

36:33.251 --> 36:35.686
Is that what you want?

36:35.721 --> 36:38.621
Of course it is.

36:38.655 --> 36:41.657
But I don't know that it's even

36:41.692 --> 36:45.128
the right time to have
a conversation about it.

36:45.162 --> 36:47.997
And I guess that's why
I didn't tell you.

36:49.166 --> 36:51.701
But I should have.

36:51.736 --> 36:54.002
Yes, you should have.

36:57.207 --> 36:59.775
Do you want to have
that conversation?

36:59.809 --> 37:02.611
Whatever you want.

37:09.719 --> 37:12.019
Now I can go to sleep.

37:18.293 --> 37:20.361
Good morning.

37:24.133 --> 37:27.400
- Where's Tammy?
- Leticia took her to the park.

37:27.434 --> 37:29.369
Oh.

37:29.403 --> 37:32.472
Well, I'm off.

37:32.506 --> 37:35.441
Couldn't you just pretend?

37:37.078 --> 37:39.880
I let you have that apartment.

37:39.914 --> 37:43.015
Somehow I thought
that there was some dignity

37:43.049 --> 37:45.117
in granting permission.

37:45.152 --> 37:48.387
All I wanted was
for you to be discreet.

37:48.421 --> 37:49.922
She lives on our block!

37:49.956 --> 37:52.324
Trudy, don't jump
to conclusions.

37:52.358 --> 37:54.760
There's no way
for me to escape.

37:54.795 --> 37:56.962
To not be an object of pity

37:56.997 --> 37:59.397
while you get to do
whatever you feel like.

37:59.431 --> 38:01.232
I have never said no to you.

38:01.267 --> 38:04.068
That is not true.
What are we doing out here?

38:05.404 --> 38:07.438
We're done, Peter.
This is over.

38:07.472 --> 38:09.107
You want a divorce?

38:09.141 --> 38:11.342
I refuse to be a failure.

38:11.376 --> 38:13.278
I don't care
what you want anymore.

38:13.312 --> 38:15.045
This is how it's going to work.

38:15.079 --> 38:18.615
You will be here only when
I tell you to be here.

38:18.649 --> 38:20.818
I'm drawing a 50-mile
radius around this house

38:20.852 --> 38:24.788
and if you so much as open your fly
to urinate, I will destroy you.

38:24.822 --> 38:26.756
Do you understand?

38:28.158 --> 38:30.059
You know what?

38:30.093 --> 38:32.261
You're going to go
to bed alone tonight

38:32.296 --> 38:35.398
and you're going to realize you
don't know anything for sure.

38:35.433 --> 38:38.166
I'll live with that.

38:50.112 --> 38:52.147
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

38:52.181 --> 38:54.248
So far this is all we have,

38:54.282 --> 38:56.884
but I want you to find out
everything you can on Heinz Ketchup.

38:56.918 --> 38:58.686
What?

38:58.721 --> 39:00.588
And this is not a joke.

39:03.992 --> 39:06.026
No.
I can't do that.

39:06.061 --> 39:07.228
Why not?

39:07.262 --> 39:09.196
It's a little bit of a secret,

39:09.231 --> 39:10.797
but it turns out
they're taking meetings.

39:10.832 --> 39:13.166
I told you that secret
and I shouldn't have.

39:13.200 --> 39:15.935
Look, everybody's gonna know.
We just know a little sooner.

39:15.970 --> 39:18.538
My friend told me that
in confidence.

39:18.573 --> 39:20.306
He's not your friend.

39:20.341 --> 39:22.242
- He's the enemy.
- Well, he doesn't know that.

39:22.276 --> 39:25.111
Maybe you need a friend
more than you need a job.

39:25.145 --> 39:26.912
I didn't know that.
I'm in advertising.

39:26.946 --> 39:28.914
It's not that.

39:28.948 --> 39:31.149
It's just that it was
a private conversation.

39:31.184 --> 39:34.219
What are you, his priest?
This is how wars are won.

39:34.254 --> 39:36.822
Your friend's mistake
was underestimating you.

39:40.727 --> 39:43.728
I hope ketchup makes the same
mistake so you can blow their mind.

39:50.910 --> 39:53.144
<i>So, correct me</i>
<i>if I'm wrong, Pete.</i>

39:53.178 --> 39:54.846
I certainly will.

39:54.880 --> 39:56.614
You're suggesting
that we forego

39:56.649 --> 39:58.682
this sparkling
national ad campaign

39:58.716 --> 40:02.719
in favor of hard-driving sales
ads at the local dealer level?

40:02.754 --> 40:05.622
Not exactly. We will still
have a national presence

40:05.657 --> 40:08.358
with the sophisticated work that
Don presented and you loved,

40:08.392 --> 40:11.929
but we will increase
sales with a surgical

40:11.963 --> 40:14.764
and financial focus
on local media.

40:14.798 --> 40:17.567
Well, that sounds good to me. Of
course, I'm a little bit biased.

40:17.601 --> 40:19.569
Why would we do that?

40:19.603 --> 40:23.072
We feel it's best to have a
plan that creates customers,

40:23.106 --> 40:24.707
not just aficionados.

40:24.741 --> 40:27.944
Don, are you really in favor

40:27.978 --> 40:29.579
of throwing
our emphasis into radio?

40:29.613 --> 40:31.813
Well, it's hard to argue

40:31.848 --> 40:34.048
with a more direct appeal
to customers.

40:34.083 --> 40:36.250
I mean, we can artsy up
the image of Jaguar,

40:36.285 --> 40:40.455
make it look romantic
and stylish,

40:40.490 --> 40:43.124
but isn't it better
to tell people

40:43.158 --> 40:45.093
who are actually
in the market for a car

40:45.127 --> 40:46.927
that a Jaguar is available?

40:49.097 --> 40:51.231
I think
it's an exciting new angle

40:51.265 --> 40:53.433
to use direct sales
on a luxury vehicle.

40:53.468 --> 40:55.903
I mean, forget about radio.

40:55.937 --> 40:57.905
How about a mailer

40:57.939 --> 40:59.640
or a circular
in the Sunday paper?

40:59.674 --> 41:02.509
I don't know if that's
what we had in mind.

41:02.543 --> 41:05.812
So this is your recommendation?

41:06.847 --> 41:08.948
I think it's better to

41:08.983 --> 41:11.450
think about someone
in New Jersey

41:11.485 --> 41:13.452
driving in their current car

41:13.487 --> 41:15.354
and hearing that
right around the corner

41:15.389 --> 41:18.224
there's a Jaguar to buy
at a low, low price.

41:20.026 --> 41:21.927
I bet the numbers would support
that don't they, Harry?

41:21.961 --> 41:24.596
That...

41:24.631 --> 41:26.698
is really a statistics game.

41:26.733 --> 41:28.967
You know what?
I will have to double-check.

41:29.002 --> 41:31.269
Look, why are you
limiting yourself?

41:31.303 --> 41:33.271
Wouldn't you rather
cast a wide net

41:33.305 --> 41:36.507
so you can sell Jaguar
to the average guy?

41:36.542 --> 41:39.510
You know, truck drivers,
housewives.

41:39.545 --> 41:42.013
<i>I was under the impression
from the work you showed us</i>

41:42.047 --> 41:44.214
<i>that this would be</i>
<i>a more elegant approach</i>

41:44.249 --> 41:48.019
that made the Jaguar seem rare
because, let's face it,

41:48.053 --> 41:52.022
the gentleman who buys our car
needs to be of some means.

41:53.558 --> 41:55.324
I am 100% positive

41:55.359 --> 41:57.661
that this approach moves cars.

41:57.695 --> 42:00.830
And not just Jaguars. This is
proven to move all kinds of cars.

42:00.865 --> 42:02.999
Hell, even used cars.
Am I wrong, Herb?

42:03.034 --> 42:06.335
No, he's right.
It moves cars.

42:06.370 --> 42:10.372
Gentlemen, we appreciate
the recommendation,

42:10.406 --> 42:12.908
but we believe we should
stay with the proposal

42:12.943 --> 42:14.376
<i>as first discussed.</i>

42:14.410 --> 42:16.745
And as persuasive
as these arguments were,

42:16.780 --> 42:20.049
that is how we will
continue to proceed.

42:20.083 --> 42:22.817
Let's not be too hasty.
Maybe we should listen to them.

42:22.851 --> 42:24.852
At least give it some thought.

42:24.887 --> 42:26.688
Herb's right.

42:26.722 --> 42:29.824
We still believe this is our
best chance for success.

42:29.858 --> 42:31.893
Fellas, this is gonna work.

42:31.927 --> 42:35.029
I'm sorry, but this is
our final decision.

42:35.064 --> 42:37.065
Thank you very much.

42:51.913 --> 42:53.714
What the hell was that?

42:53.748 --> 42:55.715
Herb, we couldn't
have pushed any harder.

42:55.749 --> 42:58.084
You pushed,
then you let Don talk.

42:58.119 --> 43:00.286
You should know better.
The guy's not a salesman.

43:02.022 --> 43:05.125
That was the deftest
self-immolation I've ever seen.

43:05.159 --> 43:06.826
I don't know what
you're talking about.

43:06.860 --> 43:08.794
I didn't know you were
capable of being that bad.

43:08.829 --> 43:11.597
- What was that in there?
- I wasn't feeling well.

43:11.631 --> 43:13.465
Something about that guy
makes me sick.

43:13.500 --> 43:16.335
Don't be cute. I still
have his spit in my hair.

43:16.369 --> 43:18.137
Why can't you
just follow the rules?

43:18.171 --> 43:20.139
I did. I did exactly
what he asked for.

43:20.173 --> 43:22.974
Not in spirit. You know damn
well that is not what he wanted.

43:23.009 --> 43:24.309
Why do we care
what that guy wants?

43:24.344 --> 43:26.478
- Because he's a client.
- Our client.

43:26.513 --> 43:29.447
And so we just keep
saying yes no matter what

43:29.481 --> 43:31.449
because we didn't say no
to begin with?

43:31.483 --> 43:33.117
You know what this is?
It's Munich.

43:33.152 --> 43:34.619
You guys are always
talking about Munich.

43:34.653 --> 43:36.387
What the hell
does that mean anyway?

43:36.421 --> 43:38.222
It means we gave the Germans
whatever they wanted

43:38.257 --> 43:40.658
to make them happy, but it
just made them want more.

43:40.692 --> 43:42.660
Well, who the hell won the war?

43:49.333 --> 43:51.535
As my mother used to say,

43:51.569 --> 43:54.037
your options were
dishonor or war.

43:54.071 --> 43:56.306
You chose dishonor,
you might still get war.

43:56.340 --> 43:57.574
That was Churchill.

44:04.747 --> 44:06.414
First one in, last one out.

44:06.448 --> 44:07.848
I don't know how you do it.

44:07.883 --> 44:10.351
Me either.

44:10.386 --> 44:13.854
Well, it can't be that bad when
you're doing something that you love.

44:13.889 --> 44:16.291
I'm glad it looks
like that to you.

44:19.195 --> 44:22.829
I spent a year in finance

44:22.863 --> 44:26.166
watching identical men
in identical suits

44:26.201 --> 44:27.901
sneak drinks out
of a desk drawer

44:27.935 --> 44:29.436
while counting
other people's money.

44:29.470 --> 44:31.071
What house?

44:31.105 --> 44:33.707
My family's been at
Brown Brothers Harriman

44:33.741 --> 44:36.076
for three generations.

44:36.110 --> 44:38.377
You make this
look a lot better.

44:38.412 --> 44:41.347
It's all about what it
looks like, isn't it?

44:41.381 --> 44:43.782
I'm going down to the deli.

44:43.817 --> 44:45.284
Can I get you something?

44:45.319 --> 44:47.220
No, thank you.

44:49.155 --> 44:50.690
Bob.

44:50.724 --> 44:53.259
My wife asked me
and I seem to have forgotten.

44:53.293 --> 44:56.261
Could you pick me up
some toilet paper?

44:56.295 --> 44:58.129
I got it, chief.

45:11.243 --> 45:13.277
Good evening.

45:13.311 --> 45:16.813
He's home. You can't knock
on the door like that.

45:16.848 --> 45:19.816
I was taking the trash out
and you left it open.

45:19.851 --> 45:21.452
Tomorrow morning.

45:24.689 --> 45:26.789
