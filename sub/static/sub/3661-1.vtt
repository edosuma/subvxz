00:49.682 --> 00:50.682
<i>Mom!</i>

00:52.393 --> 00:54.227
<i>Mom! Help me.</i>

00:57.398 --> 00:58.398
What is it?

00:58.482 --> 01:01.317
I wasn't dreaming, Walt.
I didn't imagine it.

01:01.402 --> 01:04.571
I heard him. I heard him. I heard him.
I heard Chris.

01:04.822 --> 01:07.448
- I heard him!
- I know.

01:07.658 --> 01:10.159
No. I wasn't imagining it, Walt.

01:10.578 --> 01:13.121
No, I did. He's... He's...

01:14.331 --> 01:16.541
- I heard him!
- Billie.

03:43.482 --> 03:45.525
That's about as far as I can get you.

03:45.609 --> 03:47.235
All right. Thank you.

04:01.167 --> 04:04.502
- You left all your shit on my dash.
- Keep it.

04:05.504 --> 04:07.005
Suit yourself.

04:07.590 --> 04:09.048
Thanks again.

04:11.010 --> 04:12.886
Hey, hold on a minute.

04:17.141 --> 04:20.060
Here, take these.
They'll keep your feet dry.

04:21.481 --> 04:25.358
If you make it out alive, give me a call.
My number's inside the boots.

04:25.693 --> 04:26.860
Thanks.

09:04.684 --> 09:05.851
Hello?

10:11.501 --> 10:15.087
Is there anybody here?

10:17.966 --> 10:19.466
Guess not!

11:28.079 --> 11:30.289
Two years he walks the earth.

11:37.464 --> 11:39.840
No phone, no pool, no pets,

11:40.967 --> 11:42.468
<i>no cigarettes.</i>

11:59.903 --> 12:01.612
Ultimate freedom.

12:03.531 --> 12:07.534
An extremist. An aesthetic voyager

12:09.329 --> 12:13.499
whose home is the road.

12:14.459 --> 12:17.836
"Hey, listen, old man.
Now, don't psychoanalyze me, all right?

12:18.171 --> 12:20.839
"Shut up.
I'm taking you out to where we're going."

12:20.924 --> 12:22.508
"Where you going?"

12:22.676 --> 12:25.344
"I told you. We're going nowhere!"

12:27.889 --> 12:33.519
So now, after two rambling years
comes the final and greatest adventure.

12:35.105 --> 12:38.357
The climactic battle to kill

12:39.776 --> 12:41.694
the false being within

12:42.862 --> 12:46.740
and victoriously conclude
the spiritual revolution.

13:16.396 --> 13:21.066
No longer to be poisoned
by civilization, he flees,

13:21.901 --> 13:24.695
and walks alone
upon the land to become

13:26.072 --> 13:27.698
lost in the wild.

13:59.232 --> 14:04.278
<i>... hard work and manifold contributions
to our community during their time here,</i>

14:05.238 --> 14:08.574
<i>we salute you and offer all of you</i>

14:08.700 --> 14:11.786
<i>one more round of applause
and congratulations.</i>

14:18.585 --> 14:21.379
<i>Nina Lynn Lockwynn.</i>

14:26.301 --> 14:29.512
<i>Vanessa Denise Lowery.</i>

14:33.892 --> 14:37.353
<i>Christopher Johnson McCandless.</i>

14:48.490 --> 14:51.700
<i>Regina Victoria McNabb.</i>

15:14.850 --> 15:18.519
<i>I see them standing at the formal gates
of their colleges.</i>

15:21.690 --> 15:25.734
<i>I see my father strolling out
under the ochre sandstone arch,</i>

15:26.153 --> 15:30.281
<i>the red tiles glinting like bent plates
of blood behind his head.</i>

15:31.241 --> 15:33.993
<i>I see my mother
with a few light books at her hip,</i>

15:34.077 --> 15:37.705
<i>standing at the pillar made of tiny
bricks with the wrought-iron gates</i>

15:37.789 --> 15:41.876
<i>still open behind her,
its sword-tips black in the May air.</i>

15:42.878 --> 15:44.962
<i>They are about to graduate.</i>

15:46.173 --> 15:50.926
<i>They are about to get married.
They are kids. They are dumb.</i>

15:51.511 --> 15:55.556
<i>All they know is they are innocent,
they would never hurt anybody.</i>

15:57.811 --> 16:01.522
<i>I want to go up to them and say,
"Stop, don't do it.</i>

16:01.773 --> 16:05.359
<i>"She's the wrong woman,
he's the wrong man.</i>

16:05.652 --> 16:09.739
<i>"You are going to do things
you cannot imagine you would ever do.</i>

16:09.907 --> 16:12.992
<i>"You are going to do bad things
to children.</i>

16:13.076 --> 16:15.661
<i>"You are going to suffer
in ways you never heard of.</i>

16:15.746 --> 16:17.747
<i>"You are going to want to die."</i>

16:20.209 --> 16:24.253
<i>I want to go up to them there
in the late May sunlight and say it.</i>

16:24.671 --> 16:27.632
<i>But I don't do it. I want to live.</i>

16:29.635 --> 16:33.679
<i>I take them up like the male and female
paper dolls, and bang them together</i>

16:33.764 --> 16:38.768
<i>at the hips like chips of flint, as if
to strike sparks from them. I say,</i>

16:40.270 --> 16:44.815
"Do what you are going to do
and I will tell about it."

16:46.109 --> 16:48.569
Here they are, Walt. Okay?

16:49.488 --> 16:51.197
Who wrote that?

16:51.698 --> 16:56.202
Well, could have been either one of us,
couldn't it?

16:56.286 --> 16:58.996
Why is he letting Carine drive his car?

16:59.790 --> 17:02.416
There's a lot of great poems in here.

17:07.297 --> 17:09.507
I have to speak to her about it.

17:09.590 --> 17:10.633
Sit down.

17:11.551 --> 17:13.386
Excuse me. I'm going to get my son.

17:13.470 --> 17:16.638
He just graduated today
from Emory College.

17:16.723 --> 17:18.015
I'll get it. I'll get it.

17:18.099 --> 17:21.685
Chris, hi!
We've been waiting and waiting.

17:21.770 --> 17:26.147
You scared me half to death
jumping up there on that stage like that.

17:27.401 --> 17:29.652
- Hi, Dad.
- Congratulations, Son.

17:29.778 --> 17:33.155
- This is a big step.
- Thank you, Dad.

17:33.657 --> 17:34.991
All right.

17:36.243 --> 17:38.244
You're not supposed to be driving
in Georgia.

17:38.328 --> 17:39.453
Why? I have my permit.

17:39.538 --> 17:41.747
'Cause it's against the law
for a learner's permit

17:41.832 --> 17:45.251
to drive in another state
from one's home state. That's why.

17:45.335 --> 17:48.754
I didn't know that. I thought that if I was
with a legal driver that it'd be okay.

17:48.839 --> 17:49.839
Well, let's...

17:59.516 --> 18:02.560
- Are they going to continue?
- No.

18:04.855 --> 18:07.523
I guess everybody's celebrating today.

18:07.733 --> 18:11.569
- They're going to stay in the bar, right?
- That's right.

18:22.958 --> 18:26.628
My grades are good enough, I think,
to get into Harvard Law.

18:26.712 --> 18:28.671
Chris, that's wonderful.

18:30.132 --> 18:32.216
That is a big deal.

18:32.885 --> 18:35.595
How much do you have left
in the college fund?

18:36.055 --> 18:41.142
Exactly $24,500.68.

18:41.226 --> 18:42.894
Well, that's specific.

18:42.978 --> 18:45.730
I had to go to the bank
this morning, Mom.

18:47.399 --> 18:51.569
Your mother and I will be glad
to contribute the balance for Harvard.

18:51.654 --> 18:53.112
That's right.

18:53.405 --> 18:54.739
I've got to figure out
what I'm going to do.

18:54.823 --> 18:58.284
I've got a lot of things
to pack and organize here first.

18:58.369 --> 19:02.872
Your father and I,
we want to make a present to you.

19:03.666 --> 19:06.292
We want to get you out of that junker.

19:06.835 --> 19:08.252
What junker?

19:08.712 --> 19:09.962
That.

19:12.383 --> 19:15.718
- We want to buy you a new car.
- That's right.

19:15.844 --> 19:17.261
A new car?

19:19.515 --> 19:21.599
Why would I want a new car?

19:22.685 --> 19:24.394
Datsun runs great.

19:25.938 --> 19:28.731
Do you think I want some fancy boat?

19:30.567 --> 19:33.611
Are you worried
what the neighbors might think?

19:33.779 --> 19:36.572
Well, we weren't gonna get you
a brand new Cadillac, Chris.

19:36.657 --> 19:39.867
We just want to get you a nice new car
that's safe to drive.

19:39.952 --> 19:43.538
And you never know when that thing
out there just might blow up.

19:43.622 --> 19:49.836
Blow up. Blow up?
Are you guys crazy? It's a great car.

19:50.379 --> 19:54.632
I don't need a new car.
I don't want a new car.

19:54.967 --> 19:57.051
- I don't want anything.
- Okay.

19:57.136 --> 20:00.888
- These things, things, things, things.
- Okay.

20:00.973 --> 20:02.765
- Everything has to be difficult.
- Thank you.

20:02.850 --> 20:04.934
- Thank you.
- Maybe that's not what he means.

20:05.018 --> 20:08.688
Maybe he just wants his old car.
It's not such a big deal.

20:10.983 --> 20:13.651
Thank you. I just don't want anything.

20:23.036 --> 20:25.413
<i>Chris measured himself
and those around him</i>

20:25.497 --> 20:28.082
<i>by a fiercely rigorous moral code.</i>

20:28.167 --> 20:29.292
Bye, Chris!

20:29.626 --> 20:32.712
<i>He risked what could have been
a relentlessly lonely path</i>

20:32.796 --> 20:36.509
<i>but found company
in the characters of the books he loved</i>

20:39.138 --> 20:43.349
<i>from writers like Tolstoy,
Jack London and Thoreau.</i>

20:45.019 --> 20:48.188
<i>He could summon their words
to suit any occasion,</i>

20:48.981 --> 20:50.690
<i>and he often would.</i>

21:06.081 --> 21:11.127
<i>I forgot to ask what quote he'd have
picked for his graduation dinner,</i>

21:11.212 --> 21:14.798
<i>but I had a good idea
of who the primary target would be.</i>

21:19.637 --> 21:22.639
<i>It was inevitable
that Chris would break away.</i>

21:24.683 --> 21:28.728
<i>And when he did, he would do it
with characteristic immoderation.</i>

22:14.775 --> 22:19.112
<i>"It should not be denied that being
footloose has always exhilarated us.</i>

22:20.114 --> 22:23.032
<i>"It is associated in our minds
with escape</i>

22:24.201 --> 22:28.037
<i>"from history and oppression and law
and irksome obligations.</i>

22:29.540 --> 22:31.291
<i>"Absolute freedom.</i>

22:33.544 --> 22:35.962
<i>"And the road has always led west."</i>

24:36.210 --> 24:37.711
<i>I need a name.</i>

25:07.074 --> 25:08.950
<i>Toward the end of June,</i>

25:09.035 --> 25:12.078
<i>Emory had mailed our parents
Chris' final grade report.</i>

25:12.621 --> 25:14.247
<i>Almost all A's.</i>

25:14.665 --> 25:17.419
<i>A in Apartheid in South African Society.</i>

25:18.212 --> 25:22.758
<i>A- minus in Contemporary African
Politics and the Food Crisis in Africa.</i>

25:23.634 --> 25:27.012
<i>And on it went. Clever boy, my brother.</i>

25:28.639 --> 25:32.309
<i>But by the end of July,
we hadn't heard anything from him</i>

25:32.393 --> 25:34.936
<i>and my parents
were becoming unsettled.</i>

25:36.522 --> 25:38.899
<i>Chris had never had a phone,</i>

25:38.983 --> 25:42.486
<i>so they decided to drive down
to Atlanta and surprise him.</i>

25:57.585 --> 26:00.337
<i>When they arrived at the apartment,
there was a "For Rent" sign up</i>

26:00.421 --> 26:03.924
<i>and the manager said that Chris
had moved out at the end of May.</i>

26:04.008 --> 26:06.051
Oh, yes. He left two months ago.

26:06.344 --> 26:08.345
<i>So when they got home,</i>

26:08.429 --> 26:12.557
<i>I had to hand them all the letters that
they had sent Chris that summer,</i>

26:13.142 --> 26:16.978
<i>which had been returned in a bundle.</i>

26:17.355 --> 26:21.566
<i>Chris had arranged for the post office
to hold them until August 1st,</i>

26:21.651 --> 26:24.528
<i>to buy himself some time.</i>

26:25.571 --> 26:27.614
Did you know about this?

26:28.199 --> 26:30.117
He didn't say anything.

26:30.743 --> 26:34.287
<i>I understood what he was doing.
That he had spent four years</i>

26:34.372 --> 26:38.458
<i>fulfilling the absurd and tedious duty
of graduating from college,</i>

26:41.087 --> 26:45.549
<i>and now he was emancipated
from that world of abstraction,</i>

26:45.633 --> 26:50.178
<i>false security, parents
and material excess,</i>

26:51.180 --> 26:55.016
<i>the things that cut Chris off
from the truth of his existence.</i>

28:09.302 --> 28:10.469
Hey!

28:14.474 --> 28:17.351
- Hey, man. Step around. Jump in.
- Okay, great.

28:17.936 --> 28:21.188
We barely saw you there
underneath that crazy hat of yours.

28:21.314 --> 28:25.025
This door's a little tricky.
There you go. Hop in.

28:28.655 --> 28:29.863
That's Rainey.

28:29.948 --> 28:31.657
- Hi, Rainey.
- Yeah, I'm Rainey.

28:31.741 --> 28:33.408
- I'm Jan.
- Hi. I'm Alex.

28:33.493 --> 28:34.826
Alex with the hat on.

28:34.911 --> 28:36.995
- Yeah, I know. You said it, man.
- Yeah.

28:38.748 --> 28:40.707
So you're a leather now.

28:41.960 --> 28:43.043
I'm a leather?

28:43.127 --> 28:48.257
Yeah, a leather tramp. That's what they
call the ones that hoof it, go on foot.

28:49.092 --> 28:51.301
Technically we're rubber tramps.

28:51.386 --> 28:53.428
Because we have a vehicle.

28:54.597 --> 28:57.891
- You don't have to push me away.
- Come on, please?

28:59.394 --> 29:04.523
Yeah, Alex could have a vehicle as well,
but he decided to burn all of his money.

29:06.818 --> 29:08.777
And why did you do that?

29:10.530 --> 29:13.865
I don't need money.
Makes people cautious.

29:16.202 --> 29:18.787
Come on, Alex.
You gotta be a little cautious.

29:18.871 --> 29:21.957
I mean, that book of yours is cool
and everything,

29:22.208 --> 29:25.335
but you can't depend entirely
on leaves and berries.

29:26.462 --> 29:30.090
I don't know if you want to depend on
much more than that.

29:30.967 --> 29:33.051
Where are your mom and dad?

29:36.055 --> 29:38.265
Living their lies somewhere.

29:41.269 --> 29:43.812
You look like a loved kid. Be fair.

29:44.981 --> 29:46.064
Fair?

29:47.066 --> 29:48.900
You know what I mean.

29:51.946 --> 29:54.197
I'll paraphrase Thoreau here.

29:55.201 --> 29:59.496
"Rather than love, than money,
than faith,

29:59.581 --> 30:03.625
"than fame, than fairness,

30:06.046 --> 30:07.629
"give me truth."

30:29.069 --> 30:32.112
<i>From as long ago
as Chris and I could remember,</i>

30:32.280 --> 30:35.449
<i>there have been
daily bouts of rage in our house.</i>

30:35.533 --> 30:40.037
<i>Violence that we were forced
to witness. It was very real.</i>

30:41.956 --> 30:44.541
<i>But it was also like theater.</i>

30:46.044 --> 30:50.005
<i>They cast us as both judges
and the accused.</i>

30:50.340 --> 30:55.969
And I got you this token,
this expensive token.

30:56.388 --> 30:58.555
<i>Dad had been the young genius</i>

30:58.640 --> 31:03.435
<i>that NASA enlisted to do crucial designs
for the American satellite radar systems</i>

31:03.520 --> 31:08.065
<i>that would be our answer
to the Russian Sputnik.</i>

31:08.149 --> 31:10.567
<i>And Mom and he later started up
a consulting firm</i>

31:10.652 --> 31:14.113
<i>combining her
get-up-and-go resourcefulness</i>

31:14.197 --> 31:15.823
<i>with his wealth of knowledge.</i>

31:15.907 --> 31:18.117
Look at this.

31:21.162 --> 31:24.873
<i>But by the time the company
actually made its first million,</i>

31:25.208 --> 31:30.003
<i>the careerism and money seemed
only to embolden their blindness.</i>

31:30.630 --> 31:32.631
Thank you very, very much.

31:33.675 --> 31:36.218
<i>I remember the first family meeting</i>

31:36.553 --> 31:40.013
<i>to let us in on their plans
for getting a divorce.</i>

31:40.765 --> 31:44.184
<i>They wanted us to choose
which of them we'd live with.</i>

31:46.187 --> 31:48.021
<i>We cried our eyes out.</i>

31:50.275 --> 31:52.484
<i>The divorce never happened,</i>

31:53.194 --> 31:56.363
<i>but the battles and the meetings
never stopped.</i>

31:57.615 --> 32:00.701
<i>It wasn't very long
before Chris and I shut off.</i>

32:02.579 --> 32:05.372
<i>We'd say "Go ahead.</i>

32:06.958 --> 32:08.625
<i>"Get the divorce."</i>

32:10.044 --> 32:14.967
Jeez. If I struck a match to you I'd have
dinner and warmth at the same time.

32:16.052 --> 32:17.720
Where's Jan going?

32:20.223 --> 32:21.849
Well, my friend,

32:23.393 --> 32:25.895
all is not well on the hippie front.

32:35.572 --> 32:38.741
You're an industrious little fucker,
aren't you?

32:39.951 --> 32:41.327
Little bit.

32:46.291 --> 32:50.711
It's funny how things happen
at particular times.

32:52.672 --> 32:56.133
I've loved that woman
for a lot of years, bro.

32:59.095 --> 33:01.764
But, you know, she's got a story.

33:02.682 --> 33:06.936
We've been going through this thing,
real quiet.

33:09.564 --> 33:13.651
So when we ran into you yesterday,

33:14.110 --> 33:17.446
this thing that we've been going
through real quiet,

33:18.490 --> 33:21.450
she's talking about it.
You know what I mean?

33:21.952 --> 33:24.870
- I think I do.
- You think what?

33:27.791 --> 33:28.791
Well...

33:31.878 --> 33:35.798
Some people feel like
they don't deserve love.

33:36.174 --> 33:40.594
They walk away quietly
into empty spaces,

33:42.222 --> 33:45.307
trying to close the gaps to the past.

33:45.475 --> 33:48.561
That's a hell of an insight. Jesus!

33:51.523 --> 33:54.525
- You're not Jesus, are you?
- Look who's talking.

33:54.609 --> 33:59.321
You gonna walk across the water
and get her back for me, pal?

34:00.073 --> 34:03.784
No. I'm afraid of water.

34:04.411 --> 34:06.036
Always have been.

34:06.329 --> 34:12.167
Something I've gotta get over sometime
though, huh? So I will swim in it

34:12.502 --> 34:15.337
if you'll carry the firewood back to camp.

34:17.632 --> 34:19.257
- Shit, yeah.
- Yeah?

34:19.342 --> 34:21.844
- Call it carried.
- All right.

34:56.590 --> 34:59.383
<i>"The sea's only gifts are harsh blows,</i>

35:03.096 --> 35:06.057
<i>"and, occasionally,
the chance to feel strong.</i>

35:06.725 --> 35:10.394
<i>"Now, I don't know much about the sea,</i>

35:11.021 --> 35:14.065
<i>"but I do know that
that's the way it is here.</i>

35:15.609 --> 35:18.110
<i>"And I also know
how important it is in life</i>

35:18.195 --> 35:22.239
<i>"not necessarily to be strong,
but to feel strong,</i>

35:23.450 --> 35:25.993
<i>"to measure yourself at least once,</i>

35:27.621 --> 35:32.083
<i>"to find yourself at least once in
the most ancient of human conditions,</i>

35:33.752 --> 35:36.337
<i>"facing the blind, deaf stone alone</i>

35:36.922 --> 35:41.092
<i>"with nothing to help you
but your hands and your own head."</i>

35:46.264 --> 35:48.557
There's a big wave coming!

35:52.312 --> 35:54.897
Rainey, I'm freezing!

35:55.440 --> 35:59.652
Could you put your arms around me?

36:21.633 --> 36:26.262
The Navy bulldozed and abandoned this
base down there,

36:26.346 --> 36:33.352
and all that's left is this huge grid
of concrete foundations, or slabs.

36:34.020 --> 36:37.857
- Man, you would dig the Slabs.
- You would like it. You would like it.

36:37.941 --> 36:40.151
- If you're on the road still.
- You'd love it.

36:40.235 --> 36:41.694
Fellow travelers.

36:41.778 --> 36:44.405
Just living on the cheap under the sun.
Can't beat it.

36:44.489 --> 36:45.865
Sounds good.

36:46.074 --> 36:48.701
If you come, I'll make you a proper hat.

36:48.785 --> 36:51.912
- Promise?
- I swear to God.

36:59.631 --> 37:02.425
Oh, baby. Baby.

37:02.843 --> 37:05.344
- Stop it. Wait.
- Yeah.

37:08.015 --> 37:10.475
- Oh, yes.
- Okay.

37:12.060 --> 37:13.811
Let me turn off the light.

37:55.646 --> 37:59.732
- He reminded me of...
- I know.

38:08.575 --> 38:11.619
<i>Such is the way of the world</i>

38:11.703 --> 38:14.205
<i>You can never know</i>

38:17.125 --> 38:23.047
<i>Just where to put all your faith
And how will it grow?</i>

38:24.800 --> 38:27.510
<i>Gonna rise up</i>

38:27.594 --> 38:32.223
<i>Burning back holes in dark memories</i>

38:32.975 --> 38:35.601
<i>Gonna rise up</i>

38:35.686 --> 38:40.022
<i>Turning mistakes into gold</i>

38:40.107 --> 38:43.776
I mean, you're really good.
I mean, you're like

38:45.028 --> 38:49.949
100,000 times better than, like,
any apple I've ever had.

38:51.743 --> 38:54.120
I'm not Superman, I'm Supertramp.

38:56.290 --> 38:58.207
You're Superapple.

38:58.292 --> 39:05.006
You're so tasty.
You're so organic, so natural.

39:06.174 --> 39:08.301
You're the apple of my eye.

39:10.637 --> 39:17.186
<i>Hey! Such is the passage of time
Too fast to fold</i>

39:18.898 --> 39:25.028
<i>And suddenly swallowed by signs
Lo and behold</i>

39:26.322 --> 39:29.157
<i>Gonna rise up</i>

39:29.241 --> 39:33.828
<i>Find my direction magnetically</i>

39:34.496 --> 39:37.081
<i>Gonna rise up</i>

39:37.166 --> 39:41.669
<i>Throw down my ace in the hole</i>

39:43.839 --> 39:48.259
<i>In early September, Mom and Dad
got a call from the Annandale police</i>

39:48.344 --> 39:50.428
<i>notifying them that
Chris' abandoned car</i>

39:50.512 --> 39:53.932
<i>had been identified
by the Arizona Highway Patrol.</i>

39:54.391 --> 39:58.603
<i>A group of rare flower hunters
stumbled upon it in the desert.</i>

39:59.939 --> 40:03.483
<i>There were no signs that
Chris had intended to return to it.</i>

40:03.567 --> 40:06.736
<i>But there wasn't
any evidence of struggle, either.</i>

40:08.656 --> 40:11.074
<i>The police thought
Chris had chosen to leave it behind</i>

40:11.158 --> 40:13.868
<i>and not that it was taken from him.</i>

40:17.414 --> 40:22.377
<i>The initial comfort
that gave Mom and Dad quickly turned</i>

40:22.461 --> 40:27.215
<i>to the realization that Chris
was actually trying not to be found.</i>

41:08.340 --> 41:09.757
Strong.

41:11.010 --> 41:15.388
You can do anything.
You can go anywhere.

41:16.098 --> 41:22.186
<i>Money, power is an illusion.
It's up here.</i>

41:23.689 --> 41:25.273
You can be here.

41:26.525 --> 41:29.068
Me and you.

41:43.502 --> 41:48.089
One, two. No, no, no.

41:55.806 --> 41:57.307
Two,

42:01.979 --> 42:03.146
three...

42:54.115 --> 42:56.407
Don't be shy with it. Get it moving there.
That's good.

42:56.951 --> 42:58.785
- That's your speed right here.
- Right.

42:59.995 --> 43:02.038
You go too fast,
you won't get all the wheat.

43:02.164 --> 43:04.958
That's it, straight line, straight line,
little straighter.

43:05.042 --> 43:08.378
See how you're bearing? Just a little
straighter. Now you're a combiner.

43:08.462 --> 43:10.547
Wow, look at this view!

43:10.631 --> 43:13.299
But keep your eye on the wheat, here.
Make sure you're cutting it.

43:13.384 --> 43:16.594
You can look back here and see
how much is coming out, all right.

43:16.679 --> 43:18.304
- How do you feel?
- I feel great.

43:18.389 --> 43:21.474
Okay, keep it straight. God bless you.

43:21.559 --> 43:23.852
Make yourself some money, my friend.
I'll see you in a little bit.

43:23.936 --> 43:25.019
Okay.

43:31.735 --> 43:35.572
Wayne. Where you going?

43:54.427 --> 43:58.763
Kevin, you know I love you.
I'm joking with you. I'm joking. Stop it.

43:58.890 --> 44:02.184
- I'm joking with you.
- Mind your own business, Wayne!

44:02.268 --> 44:04.436
- What are you getting so hostile for?
- I don't know.

44:04.520 --> 44:06.855
Me and you are on the same side.
We're on the same side.

44:06.939 --> 44:10.025
- I'm just tired of the teasing a lot.
- Kevin, we're on the same side.

44:10.109 --> 44:14.738
Let me get some...
If I want some vagina, let me get it.

44:14.822 --> 44:17.365
- Whoa. He's serious about this.
- Let's just play cards.

44:17.450 --> 44:19.034
- Can we just play cards?
- Let's go, then.

44:19.118 --> 44:21.870
$2, $4, $6, just put all the money in.

44:21.954 --> 44:23.788
I just wanna see
everybody going for broke.

44:23.873 --> 44:26.458
- You want to play?
- No.

44:41.390 --> 44:43.225
- Kevin, what have you got for the week?
- I got 260.

44:43.309 --> 44:45.018
We're at 260.

44:51.484 --> 44:53.360
We're gonna stay right at 260,
that's our number.

44:53.444 --> 44:55.278
We've got 20,000 pounds.

44:55.363 --> 44:59.241
We've got 20,000 pounds
we need to get rid of.

45:02.119 --> 45:06.081
Maybe just do all that after lunch
before we get back into everything else.

45:06.165 --> 45:09.668
Can we do the $500 reserves...

45:18.552 --> 45:21.096
What do you think about all this?

45:21.931 --> 45:23.515
I like all this.

45:35.611 --> 45:37.988
I don't think he can do it.

45:41.117 --> 45:43.201
Is there a library
or bookstore around here

45:43.286 --> 45:45.370
where I can get books
on hunting and preserving?

45:45.454 --> 45:47.455
Anything at all to do with hunting
or preserving the meat,

45:47.540 --> 45:49.624
smoking it, whatever the hell it is,

45:49.709 --> 45:52.585
talk to Kevin over there.
That's your man.

45:52.920 --> 45:56.131
Outdoorsman. What's your fascination
with all that stuff?

45:56.215 --> 45:57.841
I'm going to Alaska.

45:58.175 --> 46:01.094
Alaska, Alaska? Or city Alaska?

46:01.178 --> 46:03.722
Because they do have markets
in Alaska.

46:03.806 --> 46:06.975
The city ofAlaska. Not in Alaska.
In the city ofAlaska, they have markets.

46:07.059 --> 46:10.353
No, man. Alaska, Alaska.

46:10.896 --> 46:14.693
I'm gonna be all the way out there,
all the way fucking out there.

46:15.403 --> 46:16.611
Just on my own.

46:16.696 --> 46:22.200
You know, no fucking watch,
no map, no ax, no nothing. No nothing.

46:22.285 --> 46:24.995
Just be out there. Just be out there in it.

46:25.079 --> 46:29.458
You know, big mountains, rivers,
sky, game.

46:29.542 --> 46:33.420
Just be out there in it, you know?
In the wild.

46:33.588 --> 46:35.505
- In the wild.
- Just wild.

46:35.590 --> 46:37.591
- Yeah.
- Just...

46:37.717 --> 46:38.759
What are you doing when we're there?

46:38.843 --> 46:41.053
Now you're in the wild,
what are we doing?

46:41.137 --> 46:42.304
You're just living, man.

46:42.388 --> 46:45.807
You're just there, in that moment,
in that special place and time.

46:45.892 --> 46:47.100
Yeah.

46:47.226 --> 46:49.770
Maybe when I get back,
I can write a book about my travels.

46:49.854 --> 46:50.854
Why not?

46:50.938 --> 46:53.023
You know,
about getting out of this sick society.

46:53.107 --> 46:55.901
- Society!
- Society!

46:55.985 --> 46:57.569
- Society, man!
- Society!

46:57.653 --> 46:59.863
- Society! Society!
- Society!

46:59.947 --> 47:02.699
Society, you know! Society!

47:03.493 --> 47:06.161
'Cause you know
what I don't understand?

47:06.245 --> 47:10.207
I don't understand why people,
why every fucking person

47:10.291 --> 47:13.668
is so bad to each other so fucking often.

47:13.753 --> 47:18.882
It doesn't make sense to me. Judgment.
Control. All that, the whole spectrum.

47:18.966 --> 47:22.803
- Well, it just...
- What "people" we talking about?

47:24.430 --> 47:29.142
You know, parents, hypocrites,

47:30.019 --> 47:33.480
politicians, pricks.

47:35.108 --> 47:37.567
This is a mistake.

47:37.652 --> 47:41.321
It's a mistake to get too deep
into all that kind of stuff.

47:43.991 --> 47:47.244
Alex, you're a hell of a young guy,
a hell of a young guy.

47:48.830 --> 47:50.747
But I promise you this.

47:51.958 --> 47:56.545
You're a young guy! Can't be juggling
blood and fire all the time!

47:57.004 --> 48:00.257
- You've got to just kind of...
- Wayne, what are you talking about?

48:00.341 --> 48:01.758
- What?
- I mean...

48:01.843 --> 48:03.093
I'm talking about blood and fire.

48:03.177 --> 48:05.262
We're talking about
trying to juggle blood and fire.

48:05.346 --> 48:07.055
Who are you to be giving advice
to anybody anyway?

48:07.140 --> 48:08.723
Who am I to be giving advice
to anybody?

48:08.808 --> 48:10.434
- Yes.
- Well, it's nice to meet you.

48:10.518 --> 48:12.310
- My name is Mr. Happy.
- Mr. Happy.

48:12.395 --> 48:14.646
And Mr. Happy sometimes gives advice.

48:14.730 --> 48:16.773
- Alex, please.
- I'm sorry.

48:16.858 --> 48:19.484
Sometimes Mr. Happy...
Well, Mr. Happy is always happy.

48:19.569 --> 48:21.027
But you know when he's happiest?

48:21.112 --> 48:22.487
- He's not always happy.
- When is he happy?

48:22.572 --> 48:25.115
Are you really gonna say that to me?
Come on, tell me about it.

48:25.199 --> 48:27.159
I am going to say that to you.

48:32.041 --> 48:34.543
- Now...
- Sit down before you hurt yourself.

48:34.627 --> 48:37.838
One thing that you should try
to keep your eye on

48:38.506 --> 48:41.550
is what happened
in the late 1940s in Roswell.

48:55.523 --> 48:57.733
<i>When a search of tax records
revealed that</i>

48:57.817 --> 49:00.402
<i>Chris had given
his life savings to charity,</i>

49:00.737 --> 49:05.073
<i>Mom and Dad became
what Dad called "mobilized."</i>

49:05.158 --> 49:09.661
<i>They hired a private investigator and
notified law enforcement nationwide,</i>

49:09.954 --> 49:12.331
<i>determined to track him down.</i>

49:12.624 --> 49:17.211
<i>I just figured he'd be with gypsies,
far from the eyes of the law.</i>

49:21.299 --> 49:23.675
These are those free satellite TV deals.

49:23.760 --> 49:26.678
You're the one who said it, Alex, not me.

49:28.932 --> 49:31.350
You're gonna need something.
What kind of gun you got?

49:31.434 --> 49:35.771
I'm probably gonna get like a.22,
I think. A.22 caliber rifle.

49:37.982 --> 49:39.441
All right, then.

49:39.901 --> 49:42.694
When you get your kill,
time is of the essence.

49:42.779 --> 49:44.863
Now, the first thing you wanna do
is make sure

49:44.948 --> 49:47.950
that you got that meat
nice and shaved up.

49:48.117 --> 49:50.619
And you don't have a lot of time to do
this. This is about an hour or two.

49:50.703 --> 49:54.623
Depending on the weather. Especially if
it's hot, you've got less time to do it.

49:54.707 --> 49:58.877
What you do is you want to make sure
that them flies don't land on your meat.

49:58.962 --> 50:02.798
Because once them flies start
shitting out larvae and them maggots,

50:03.508 --> 50:07.553
you know, those creepy crawlies,
it's too late. It's too late.

51:15.040 --> 51:17.458
You got me. You got me.

51:23.256 --> 51:25.841
I warned Wayne
about them little black boxes.

51:26.009 --> 51:29.637
Mr. Westerberg, Scott Baker, FBI.
I think you know why we're here.

51:29.721 --> 51:31.889
- Impressive turn-out.
- Yeah.

51:31.973 --> 51:35.059
You mind grabbing that zipper
for me there? Thank you.

51:35.810 --> 51:36.894
- Let's go.
- Sorry, boys.

51:36.978 --> 51:39.229
We're gonna have to shut down
for a little while.

51:39.314 --> 51:42.066
Alex, you come back
and work for me any time you want.

51:42.150 --> 51:44.860
Gil's got your checks, guys.
I shouldn't be away too long.

51:44.944 --> 51:49.823
Remember Alex, no Alaska till spring.
South, kid. You wanna head south.

52:15.392 --> 52:17.768
<i>The year Chris graduated high school,</i>

52:17.852 --> 52:21.271
<i>he bought the Datsun used
and drove it cross-country.</i>

52:22.607 --> 52:24.775
<i>He stayed away most of the summer.</i>

52:25.360 --> 52:27.861
Come on. The neighbors
are gonna be watching, honey.

52:27.946 --> 52:29.279
Can you spray it?

52:34.619 --> 52:38.789
<i>As soon as I heard he was home,
I ran into his room to talk to him.</i>

52:43.586 --> 52:47.172
<i>In California,
he'd looked up some old family friends.</i>

52:47.966 --> 52:52.803
<i>He discovered that our parents' stories
of how they fell in love and got married</i>

52:52.887 --> 52:55.764
<i>were calculated lies
masking an ugly truth.</i>

52:56.975 --> 52:59.643
<i>When they met,
Dad was already married.</i>

53:00.645 --> 53:02.896
<i>And even after Chris was born,</i>

53:02.981 --> 53:05.858
<i>Dad had had another son
with his first wife, Marcia,</i>

53:07.193 --> 53:09.820
<i>to whom he was still legally married.</i>

53:11.783 --> 53:16.996
<i>This fact suddenly re-defined
Chris and me as bastard children.</i>

53:21.626 --> 53:26.380
<i>Dad's arrogance made him conveniently
oblivious to the pain he caused.</i>

53:28.091 --> 53:32.178
<i>And Mom, in the shame and
embarrassment of a young mistress,</i>

53:32.804 --> 53:35.306
<i>became his accomplice in deceit.</i>

53:40.729 --> 53:44.482
<i>The fragility of crystal is not
a weakness but a fineness.</i>

53:45.650 --> 53:48.778
<i>My parents understood that
a fine crystal glass had to be cared for</i>

53:48.862 --> 53:51.280
<i>or it may be shattered.</i>

53:51.364 --> 53:55.618
<i>But when it came to my brother,
they did not seem to know or care</i>

53:55.702 --> 53:57.953
<i>that their course of secret action</i>

53:58.038 --> 54:02.124
<i>brought the kind of devastation
that could cut them.</i>

54:03.794 --> 54:08.422
<i>Their fraudulent marriage
and our father's denial of this other son</i>

54:08.715 --> 54:12.885
<i>was, for Chris,
a murder of every day's truth.</i>

54:14.012 --> 54:17.848
<i>He felt his whole life turn,
like a river suddenly reversing</i>

54:17.933 --> 54:22.019
<i>the direction of its flow,
suddenly running uphill.</i>

54:28.735 --> 54:33.322
<i>These revelations struck at the core
of Chris' sense of identity.</i>

54:33.406 --> 54:37.451
<i>They made his entire childhood
seem like fiction.</i>

54:39.579 --> 54:41.163
<i>Chris never told them he knew</i>

54:44.584 --> 54:47.127
<i>and made me promise silence, as well.</i>

54:47.921 --> 54:50.172
I can't afford four.
Who's gonna pay for the fourth one?

54:50.257 --> 54:53.425
Bryan can't afford four. Does it matter?

54:54.261 --> 54:55.803
Can I help you?

54:55.887 --> 54:58.347
Yeah. If I wanted
to paddle down the river,

54:58.431 --> 55:00.599
where's the best place to launch out of?

55:00.684 --> 55:01.851
Hang on a second.

55:01.935 --> 55:05.145
"To launch out of?"
What's your experience level?

55:06.273 --> 55:09.567
- Not much.
- Any? Do you have a permit?

55:09.651 --> 55:11.694
A permit? Permit for what?

55:12.237 --> 55:14.572
You can't paddle down the river
without a permit.

55:14.656 --> 55:17.032
If you want, you can apply for one here,
get some experience,

55:17.117 --> 55:19.034
and I'll put you on the wait-list.

55:19.119 --> 55:21.787
No, I got this guy in here.
We'll figure it out.

55:21.872 --> 55:24.456
There's a wait-list
to paddle down a river?

55:24.541 --> 55:25.958
That's right.

55:26.251 --> 55:28.502
- Yeah, it's gonna be...
- Well, how long do I have to wait?

55:28.587 --> 55:30.045
Yeah, hang on a second.

55:30.130 --> 55:34.176
Now, the deal is
it's gonna be me and you

55:34.261 --> 55:37.597
or it's gonna be me, you and her.

55:37.681 --> 55:42.268
Next available is May 17th, 2003.

55:43.145 --> 55:47.148
Great. Done. The three of us, then.

55:47.357 --> 55:48.816
Twelve years?

55:49.276 --> 55:51.235
- What's that?
- Twelve years?

55:51.403 --> 55:52.987
To paddle down a river.

55:53.071 --> 55:54.906
Let me call you back.

55:55.532 --> 55:57.366
You can do that,

55:57.451 --> 56:00.578
or you can join a commercial raft trip,
go with a licensed guide.

56:00.662 --> 56:02.413
They may have some
last-minute cancellations,

56:02.497 --> 56:05.041
but that's gonna cost you $2,000.

56:06.835 --> 56:08.586
Thank you very much.

56:46.333 --> 56:47.959
Helmet, man!

57:27.416 --> 57:28.624
I'm Supertramp!

57:41.722 --> 57:45.099
<i>"If we admit that human life
can be ruled by reason,</i>

57:45.851 --> 57:48.436
<i>"the possibility of life is destroyed."</i>

58:18.969 --> 58:20.428
Hello!

58:22.890 --> 58:24.057
Hello.

58:24.767 --> 58:27.226
Come. Join us.

58:28.479 --> 58:29.979
We have hot dogs.

58:45.370 --> 58:46.913
- I'm Mads.
- Mads?

58:46.997 --> 58:48.581
- Mads. Hi.
- Mads.

58:48.665 --> 58:50.500
- Alex.
- Hi, Alex.

58:50.584 --> 58:52.627
Hey. I'm Sonja.

58:53.420 --> 58:55.004
Hey, Alex.

58:56.423 --> 59:00.635
We are from Copenhagen,
and you are from the rapids.

59:01.512 --> 59:02.637
I am.

59:09.770 --> 59:11.938
- You're crazy! You're crazy, man.
- My God!

59:12.022 --> 59:15.066
Sonja, get away from him. Get away
from him. He's crazy! Look, he's crazy.

59:15.150 --> 59:17.360
I'll make you a hot dog. One minute.

59:20.405 --> 59:23.616
I love this. Don't you love this?

59:23.826 --> 59:27.203
You know, this is nature.

59:36.338 --> 59:38.214
So where are you going?

59:38.882 --> 59:41.425
- I haven't decided yet.
- Really?

59:41.510 --> 59:44.846
Well, we like it here very much.
And it's so good to meet you, man.

59:44.930 --> 59:46.055
So good to meet you.

59:46.140 --> 59:50.184
You know, we went to Los Angeles,
and then we went to Las Vegas.

59:50.269 --> 59:55.148
Oh, yeah. Las Vegas is very nice.
The universe is so good.

01:00:00.070 --> 01:00:02.864
- The universe is very good.
- You know what I mean?

01:00:02.948 --> 01:00:05.199
- Yeah.
- The whole universe.

01:00:05.367 --> 01:00:09.662
Just the place. The city, she means.
Her English is not very good.

01:00:09.790 --> 01:00:14.752
But then we came here. I don't care
if she's a little stupid, but I like her.

01:00:15.921 --> 01:00:18.506
You know you can actually go
all the way down to Mexico from here.

01:00:18.591 --> 01:00:19.632
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:00:19.717 --> 01:00:24.262
You can take the kayak,
and you can take it all the way around

01:00:24.346 --> 01:00:26.723
down to Hoover Dam,
you can sail around,

01:00:26.807 --> 01:00:31.269
and then from there you can take
the river all the way down to Mexico!

01:00:31.729 --> 01:00:33.438
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:00:37.193 --> 01:00:39.110
Come on, come on!

01:00:39.612 --> 01:00:41.946
She's so slow sometimes.

01:00:42.948 --> 01:00:46.492
- Here's the map.
- But I like her.

01:00:49.371 --> 01:00:51.289
- Here. Hoover Dam.
- Okay.

01:00:51.498 --> 01:00:53.750
About 330 kilometers, I think.

01:00:53.834 --> 01:00:56.711
- Miles?
- Yeah, miles, about 200 miles.

01:00:56.795 --> 01:01:00.882
- Two hundred miles.
- Two hundred miles. Yeah, man.

01:01:01.383 --> 01:01:02.842
You know, I wonder if I could paddle

01:01:02.927 --> 01:01:05.053
all the way down that
into the Gulf of California.

01:01:05.137 --> 01:01:07.972
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can.
You know, I will go with you.

01:01:08.474 --> 01:01:10.975
I will go with you. We leave Sonja here,
and then we take the kayak.

01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:13.311
No, no.
We go all the way down into Mexico.

01:01:13.395 --> 01:01:18.149
You know, because in every man's
heart, there is a Mexican mistress.

01:01:34.875 --> 01:01:36.626
Oh, man.

01:01:37.127 --> 01:01:39.420
I've gotta go, you guys.
I'm really sorry. I gotta go.

01:01:39.505 --> 01:01:41.381
- What's going on?
- Why?

01:01:41.465 --> 01:01:45.093
The river patrol's after me. I'm actually
not supposed to be here, you know.

01:01:45.177 --> 01:01:46.761
You have to have, like, a permit,

01:01:46.845 --> 01:01:50.515
it's like a government thing to be here,
and I didn't get one.

01:01:50.599 --> 01:01:52.475
If you see anybody,
any of the rangers or anything,

01:01:52.559 --> 01:01:54.435
just tell them you didn't see me, okay?

01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:55.603
Okay.

01:01:55.688 --> 01:02:00.233
Okay, again, I'm really, really sorry,
man. I wish I could stay, you know.

01:02:00.317 --> 01:02:01.317
Take care, man.

01:02:01.402 --> 01:02:02.443
- All right. Take care, Mads.
- Nice to meet you.

01:02:02.528 --> 01:02:05.446
- Bye, Alex.
- I wish... I wish I could stay.

01:02:05.531 --> 01:02:07.865
Say hello to Mexico from me.

01:02:10.286 --> 01:02:12.453
Bye, Alex!

01:02:44.739 --> 01:02:47.657
<i>It would be Christmas
in a couple of months,</i>

01:02:48.034 --> 01:02:51.619
<i>and the last news we'd had
was about his car being found.</i>

01:02:52.163 --> 01:02:56.541
<i>I woke up a couple of days ago,
and for the first time, it bothered me</i>

01:02:56.751 --> 01:03:00.170
<i>that it wasn't only my parents
who hadn't heard from Chris.</i>

01:03:00.254 --> 01:03:01.379
Honey?

01:03:01.464 --> 01:03:06.009
It's me. I'm sorry.
Everything that happened, it's my fault.

01:03:07.595 --> 01:03:09.512
Give me another chance.

01:03:11.265 --> 01:03:14.768
Please do that... Come on.
Do that for me.

01:03:17.897 --> 01:03:20.190
Come on. They're calling
for another quarter right now,

01:03:20.274 --> 01:03:22.901
and I ain't got it, so will you hurry it up?

01:03:24.236 --> 01:03:26.321
Come on now, don't hang up on me.

01:03:27.239 --> 01:03:30.200
Hey, here's a quarter.

01:03:30.284 --> 01:03:31.618
Thank you.

01:03:31.869 --> 01:03:35.663
There's a quarter
just happened out of the sky,

01:03:35.748 --> 01:03:39.125
so I'm on here talking to you again.

01:03:40.336 --> 01:03:43.838
I got the quarter now, let's...
No, no, no, no, no!

01:03:48.677 --> 01:03:52.514
<i>I wondered why he hadn't tried to call
in case I might answer.</i>

01:03:52.807 --> 01:03:55.350
<i>He could've hung up if it wasn't me.</i>

01:03:56.519 --> 01:04:00.146
<i>Why wouldn't he send a letter,
maybe through a friend?</i>

01:04:00.231 --> 01:04:01.856
<i>It hurt a little,</i>

01:04:04.276 --> 01:04:06.903
<i>but I told myself it was good.</i>

01:04:08.989 --> 01:04:12.826
<i>He knew I loved him enough
to bear with the not knowing.</i>

01:04:14.954 --> 01:04:19.290
<i>And it helped me remember that there
was something more than rebellion,</i>

01:04:19.583 --> 01:04:22.168
<i>more than anger that was driving him.</i>

01:04:28.676 --> 01:04:32.470
<i>Chris had always been driven,
had always been an adventurer.</i>

01:04:46.694 --> 01:04:48.528
<i>When he was four years old,</i>

01:04:48.612 --> 01:04:53.660
<i>he once wandered six blocks away
from home at 3:00 in the morning.</i>

01:05:00.376 --> 01:05:02.669
<i>He was found in a neighbor's kitchen</i>

01:05:02.753 --> 01:05:06.006
<i>up on a chair,
digging through their candy drawer.</i>

01:05:08.468 --> 01:05:13.346
<i>Whatever drawer he was opening now
must have something pretty sweet in it.</i>

01:07:11.634 --> 01:07:15.554
<i>- You lived in a cave for 36 days?
- Yes, sir.</i>

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:17.681
<i>And how did you get into Mexico
in the first place?</i>

01:07:17.765 --> 01:07:20.350
<i>Through the spillway at Morelos Dam.</i>

01:07:20.810 --> 01:07:22.811
<i>River dries out pretty quickly
beyond there, doesn't it?</i>

01:07:22.895 --> 01:07:27.691
<i>Yeah. Turns into a maze of irrigation
canals, thanks to our dams up north.</i>

01:07:28.109 --> 01:07:32.029
<i>So I ported my kayak over the desert,
and I hitched down to Golfo.</i>

01:07:33.197 --> 01:07:37.367
<i>But after a few weeks, a sandstorm
came up and blew the kayak away.</i>

01:07:37.702 --> 01:07:40.037
<i>So I walked back north. Here I am.</i>

01:07:40.121 --> 01:07:43.832
<i>Well, you just can't be crossing
the borders without any identification.</i>

01:07:43.916 --> 01:07:45.792
- Are we understood?
- Yes, sir.

01:07:45.877 --> 01:07:48.337
I've eaten enough sand to send me
back to the city anyway.

01:07:48.421 --> 01:07:51.131
All right. Sit tight. I'll be right back.

01:07:52.550 --> 01:07:56.595
<i>Some may ask,
"Why act now? Why not wait?"</i>

01:07:57.388 --> 01:08:01.141
<i>The answer is clear.
The world could wait no longer.</i>

01:10:27.373 --> 01:10:29.082
Hi. Do you have the time?

01:10:29.542 --> 01:10:31.001
- Time?
- Time?

01:10:31.085 --> 01:10:32.336
Yeah.

01:10:33.630 --> 01:10:35.047
Okay.

01:11:15.964 --> 01:11:17.339
Front and back.

01:11:17.423 --> 01:11:21.426
I don't have any more clipboards,
so get one from the other fellas.

01:11:21.678 --> 01:11:23.178
- Next.
- Hi.

01:11:23.429 --> 01:11:25.806
Can you tell me how to get an ID?

01:11:25.974 --> 01:11:28.725
- Did you lose your identification, sir?
- Yeah.

01:11:28.810 --> 01:11:31.395
No birth certificate? Nothing?

01:11:31.646 --> 01:11:32.771
Ouch.

01:11:33.064 --> 01:11:36.817
All right. Well, you're gonna
have to work that out with the DMV.

01:11:36.901 --> 01:11:41.196
You can catch them in the morning.
The closest one is Montebello,

01:11:42.198 --> 01:11:44.199
and we can help you
with the bus voucher.

01:11:44.284 --> 01:11:46.368
So just come to this desk
when you're ready for the voucher.

01:11:46.452 --> 01:11:48.080
- Okay.
- What's your name?

01:11:48.164 --> 01:11:51.834
- Alexander Supertramp.
- What's that?

01:11:51.918 --> 01:11:57.798
- Alexander Supertramp.
- Supertramp. Really?

01:11:58.049 --> 01:11:59.049
Yeah.

01:12:00.176 --> 01:12:03.929
Okay, so I'm gonna look for you,
Supertramp. I got something for you.

01:12:06.433 --> 01:12:08.851
- Here you go, Supertramp.
- Thank you very much.

01:12:08.935 --> 01:12:10.227
Okay, baby.

01:12:10.312 --> 01:12:13.355
- And one last thing.
- Yeah.

01:12:15.275 --> 01:12:17.693
Do you have a bed for me? I'm sorry...

01:12:17.777 --> 01:12:21.572
Oh, no. Sure, I got a bed for you.
Sign your name right here.

01:12:21.656 --> 01:12:26.869
You fill this out. And I'll set you right up.
Now, I'm out of...

01:12:26.953 --> 01:12:29.788
- What's going on back there?
- I got it. I'm sorry.

01:12:29.873 --> 01:12:33.250
- Come on, now. Work with me.
- All right. Thanks, ma'am.

01:12:33.335 --> 01:12:35.669
Supertramp, huh?

01:12:38.590 --> 01:12:40.507
You know the drill.

01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:15.292
Move it!

01:14:02.882 --> 01:14:05.509
Thanks, but I'm not gonna need
that bed after all.

01:14:05.593 --> 01:14:07.805
You leaving us so soon? Supertramp!

01:15:11.495 --> 01:15:15.831
Show me your face.
I never, ever, ever forget a face.

01:15:16.249 --> 01:15:19.251
If I see yours again,
I won't arrest you, I'll kill you.

01:15:19.336 --> 01:15:21.212
This is the goddamned railroad,

01:15:21.296 --> 01:15:22.922
and we will do whatever we have to do

01:15:23.006 --> 01:15:25.424
to keep you freeloaders
from violating our liability.

01:15:25.509 --> 01:15:26.801
Yes, sir.

01:15:30.514 --> 01:15:32.181
You got any ID?

01:15:33.517 --> 01:15:36.727
- No, sir.
- Of course you don't.

01:15:37.604 --> 01:15:39.396
Last time, my friend.

01:15:40.524 --> 01:15:41.857
All clear.

01:15:49.866 --> 01:15:51.242
Good boy!

01:16:09.302 --> 01:16:12.388
<i>Yeah! That's what I'm talking about.
Finally!</i>

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:18.769
<i>It's a mystery to me</i>

01:16:19.604 --> 01:16:24.984
<i>We have a greed
With which we have agreed</i>

01:16:26.403 --> 01:16:31.242
<i>You think you have to want more
than you need</i>

01:16:32.452 --> 01:16:37.165
<i>Until you have it all you won't be freed</i>

01:16:40.085 --> 01:16:45.506
<i>Society, you're a crazy breed</i>

01:16:46.049 --> 01:16:52.013
<i>I hope you're not lonely without me</i>

01:16:55.434 --> 01:17:00.479
<i>When you want more than you have
You think you need</i>

01:17:01.398 --> 01:17:06.277
<i>And when you think more than you want
Your thoughts begin to bleed</i>

01:17:07.821 --> 01:17:12.783
<i>I think I need to find a bigger place</i>

01:17:13.285 --> 01:17:15.661
<i>'Cause when you have
more than you think</i>

01:17:15.746 --> 01:17:17.955
<i>You need more space</i>

01:17:21.543 --> 01:17:26.964
<i>Society, you're a crazy breed</i>

01:17:27.466 --> 01:17:32.428
<i>I hope you're not lonely without me</i>

01:17:33.347 --> 01:17:38.392
<i>Society, crazy indeed</i>

01:17:39.311 --> 01:17:45.650
<i>I hope you're not lonely without me</i>

01:18:35.033 --> 01:18:36.492
Thanks a lot.

01:18:45.711 --> 01:18:48.673
<i>In the letters
Chris wrote me from college,</i>

01:18:49.216 --> 01:18:53.428
<i>it was clear his anguish and problems
with Mom and Dad had continued.</i>

01:19:02.896 --> 01:19:04.772
<i>He said I was
the only person in the world</i>

01:19:04.857 --> 01:19:07.483
<i>who could possibly understand
what he had to say.</i>

01:19:07.568 --> 01:19:10.570
With whose money are you buying
all these goddamn presents?

01:19:10.654 --> 01:19:13.072
I work. The only reason
I'm not talking is because

01:19:13.157 --> 01:19:15.825
you're wandering around acting like
the big-shot flirt with everybody.

01:19:15.909 --> 01:19:19.495
I am making the contacts
for this business to work!

01:19:19.621 --> 01:19:21.581
You don't care at all about what I do!

01:19:21.665 --> 01:19:23.499
I don't even want to talk to you
about it anymore!

01:19:23.584 --> 01:19:26.669
Don't you walk away from me, woman!
Woman!

01:19:27.296 --> 01:19:29.672
Kids! Look what your dad
is doing to me!

01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:33.176
For God's sake,
look what your mother is making me do!

01:19:33.260 --> 01:19:35.261
Fuck you! I hate you!

01:19:37.639 --> 01:19:40.808
There ain't gonna be no party.
I'm gonna cancel Christmas this year.

01:19:40.934 --> 01:19:44.187
<i>Cancel Christmas?
Who do you think you are? God?</i>

01:19:44.271 --> 01:19:46.105
<i>That's right! I'm God!</i>

01:19:46.190 --> 01:19:49.025
<i>Well, you're not God.
You can't cancel Christmas.</i>

01:19:49.276 --> 01:19:50.610
<i>That's bullshit!</i>

01:21:46.729 --> 01:21:48.229
We're 10 deep!

01:21:56.113 --> 01:22:00.909
Alex, I don't mean to be on you about
everything. You're doing a great job.

01:22:01.118 --> 01:22:04.829
I wanna keep you on and
we all wanna help you get to Alaska,

01:22:05.498 --> 01:22:08.124
but you've got to start wearing socks.

01:22:16.050 --> 01:22:19.761
<i>With almost a year having passed
since Chris' disappearance,</i>

01:22:20.304 --> 01:22:23.681
<i>my parents' anger, their desperation,</i>

01:22:23.766 --> 01:22:26.100
<i>their guilt was giving way to pain.</i>

01:22:29.104 --> 01:22:31.731
<i>And pain seemed to bring them closer.</i>

01:22:34.068 --> 01:22:36.277
<i>Even their faces had changed.</i>

01:23:02.471 --> 01:23:04.931
<i>She convinces herself it's Chris,</i>

01:23:06.308 --> 01:23:09.644
<i>that it's her son
whenever she passes a stray.</i>

01:23:11.438 --> 01:23:13.815
<i>And I fear for the mother in her.</i>

01:23:17.486 --> 01:23:22.490
<i>Instincts that seem to sense the threat
of a loss so huge</i>

01:23:22.575 --> 01:23:27.289
<i>and irrevocable that the mind balks
at taking its measure.</i>

01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:34.087
<i>I'd begin to wonder if I can understand
all that Chris is saying any longer,</i>

01:23:37.258 --> 01:23:40.218
<i>but I catch myself and remember that</i>

01:23:40.303 --> 01:23:42.679
<i>these are not the parents
he grew up with,</i>

01:23:43.973 --> 01:23:48.602
<i>but people softened by the forced
reflection that comes with loss.</i>

01:23:53.190 --> 01:23:58.278
<i>Still, everything Chris is saying
has to be said.</i>

01:24:00.031 --> 01:24:03.908
<i>And I trust for him that
everything he is doing has to be done.</i>

01:24:05.703 --> 01:24:07.329
<i>This is our life.</i>

01:25:15.022 --> 01:25:18.650
Big game. Very big game.

01:25:19.110 --> 01:25:20.276
Got it.

01:27:11.224 --> 01:27:12.599
Damn it!

01:27:16.938 --> 01:27:18.271
Get off!

01:28:01.190 --> 01:28:04.609
"Hey, Dad, can I light the barbeque,
please, Dad, this time?"

01:28:05.238 --> 01:28:06.697
"Well, Son,
you can go get the lighter fluid."

01:28:06.781 --> 01:28:09.283
"Come on, Dad. Please, Dad, please?"

01:28:09.951 --> 01:28:12.536
"Well, why not, Walt?
That sounds like a good idea..."

01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:14.538
"Shut up, Carine! Shut up, Carine!

01:28:14.622 --> 01:28:19.126
"No, Billie. I told you once.
Don't make me tell you again. Okay?

01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:21.128
"Okay?

01:28:21.379 --> 01:28:23.046
"You hear me? You hear me, woman?

01:28:23.131 --> 01:28:26.133
<i>"You hear me, woman? Huh?
You hear me, woman?"</i>

01:28:28.469 --> 01:28:33.891
<i>"Sorry. Sorry, Walt. I'm sorry."</i>

01:28:47.113 --> 01:28:48.322
Shit.

01:28:54.370 --> 01:28:59.124
No! No! Damn it!

01:29:02.003 --> 01:29:04.671
<i>God damn it! Fuck!</i>

01:29:48.049 --> 01:29:53.136
<i>"There was clearly felt the presence of
a force not bound to be kind to man.</i>

01:29:54.389 --> 01:29:57.933
<i>"It was a place of heathenism
and superstitious rites,</i>

01:29:59.268 --> 01:30:02.688
<i>"to be inhabited by men
nearer of kin to the rocks</i>

01:30:02.897 --> 01:30:05.440
<i>"and to the wild animals than we."</i>

01:30:28.091 --> 01:30:29.341
Sunni.

01:30:29.843 --> 01:30:32.886
Hey, Sunni! Come here, baby.

01:30:38.435 --> 01:30:41.061
No. No!

01:31:14.679 --> 01:31:18.015
But now all I'm focused on
is just Alaska.

01:31:18.099 --> 01:31:19.683
- Yeah.
- Alaska.

01:31:21.644 --> 01:31:24.646
<i>All right. Let's hear it for Insane Cain!</i>

01:31:28.109 --> 01:31:31.236
<i>Let's give it up
for Slab City's own Tracy T!</i>

01:31:39.954 --> 01:31:41.872
<i>Hey. My name's Tracy.</i>

01:31:41.956 --> 01:31:43.749
- Tracy!
- Yeah!

01:32:13.822 --> 01:32:16.448
Jack London is king.

01:32:17.575 --> 01:32:19.701
Hey, you gonna stay with us long?

01:32:20.495 --> 01:32:22.663
Well, I'm waiting on a check
from my last job

01:32:22.747 --> 01:32:25.124
to come into Salton City
the day after Christmas.

01:32:25.208 --> 01:32:28.001
I've got to start thinking about
getting ready for Alaska.

01:32:28.086 --> 01:32:32.673
When the sun gets a little lower tonight,
I'm going to start a calisthenics routine.

01:32:33.007 --> 01:32:35.759
After the check comes in,
I think I'm gonna try to find

01:32:35.844 --> 01:32:39.138
some big old mountains I can climb
every day until spring comes.

01:32:39.222 --> 01:32:41.390
I've got to see
how far the money's gonna go.

01:32:41.474 --> 01:32:45.062
I've still got a lot of supplies
to pick up before spring.

01:32:45.897 --> 01:32:50.442
So, I might get anotherjob
or I might be okay.

01:32:50.986 --> 01:32:55.156
Hell, we'd give you a little something for
the days you spend in the booth here.

01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:57.741
I'm not taking
any money from you, Rainey.

01:32:58.201 --> 01:33:01.120
It's been a real great twist
meeting you two.

01:33:01.204 --> 01:33:03.414
You two look like you're doing good.

01:33:03.707 --> 01:33:05.666
- We are doing good.
- Yeah?

01:33:05.750 --> 01:33:06.959
We're doing real good.

01:33:07.669 --> 01:33:10.671
Speaking of which, don't you think

01:33:10.755 --> 01:33:15.092
you ought to introduce yourself
to our little Joni Mitchell over there?

01:33:19.514 --> 01:33:20.514
I...

01:33:55.300 --> 01:33:57.885
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:34:03.516 --> 01:34:05.476
You selling these books?

01:34:05.769 --> 01:34:08.604
I am. We are.

01:34:09.856 --> 01:34:11.190
He was.

01:34:14.945 --> 01:34:16.487
I like to read.

01:34:17.322 --> 01:34:19.823
- Do you?
- Yeah.

01:34:20.492 --> 01:34:22.326
That's good.

01:34:23.495 --> 01:34:27.206
I heard you play your song last night.

01:34:28.416 --> 01:34:33.170
- I'm terrible.
- You are not terrible. You sing sweet.

01:34:34.005 --> 01:34:35.339
Thank you.

01:34:38.718 --> 01:34:41.887
I was gonna go take a walk
to Salvation Mountain.

01:34:42.555 --> 01:34:45.349
- You wanna go?
- Okay.

01:34:53.358 --> 01:34:56.026
- Hi.
- Hi. Alex.

01:34:56.987 --> 01:35:02.741
I'd like to show you around up here.
I've been here since 1984, more or less.

01:35:05.539 --> 01:35:07.290
A lot of tourists come in here

01:35:07.374 --> 01:35:11.168
and they look at that car door up there.
They really like it.

01:35:12.045 --> 01:35:16.048
And I found car doors and put them
up there and I bolted it all in.

01:35:16.133 --> 01:35:17.633
Where did you get the telephone poles?

01:35:17.718 --> 01:35:20.553
A lot of people in the valley
just love me a lot.

01:35:20.679 --> 01:35:23.222
Everybody now, I think,
in the whole world is just loving me.

01:35:23.307 --> 01:35:26.559
And I want to have the wisdom
to love them back.

01:35:27.561 --> 01:35:30.187
And that's about it.
So I really get excited.

01:35:30.272 --> 01:35:31.981
You really believe in love, then.

01:35:32.065 --> 01:35:34.400
Yeah. Totally.

01:35:35.068 --> 01:35:39.989
This is a love story that is staggering
to everybody in the whole world.

01:35:40.073 --> 01:35:42.908
That God really loves us a lot.

01:35:43.952 --> 01:35:45.453
Does that answer that?

01:35:45.537 --> 01:35:47.163
- Yeah.
- Good.

01:35:49.124 --> 01:35:53.377
I really love it here. I think the freedom
of this place is just so beautiful.

01:35:53.462 --> 01:35:57.423
To me, I wouldn't move for $10 million,
unless I had to.

01:35:59.217 --> 01:36:02.928
So I'm contented here in the desert,
and I'm living where I want to live.

01:36:03.138 --> 01:36:08.684
And I think good gets better.
And I think those great big tanks there

01:36:08.769 --> 01:36:12.396
were the sewer plant for
the Marine base in World War II.

01:36:14.983 --> 01:36:17.693
If you want to,
you can try putting your hands in there.

01:36:17.778 --> 01:36:20.946
And I'm gonna do the same thing,
just for the fun.

01:36:21.615 --> 01:36:23.532
You're doing real good.

01:36:26.953 --> 01:36:30.289
You can wipe your hands off on my shirt
if you want.

01:36:50.644 --> 01:36:53.145
This is starting to make me hungry.

01:36:53.939 --> 01:36:57.983
I was just a couple of years older
than Tracy when I got pregnant.

01:37:01.822 --> 01:37:03.447
<i>- Wow.
- Yeah.</i>

01:37:05.242 --> 01:37:09.370
Yeah, I thought my husband and I were
going to just make peace on Earth

01:37:10.163 --> 01:37:12.957
and babies and love
and stay together forever,

01:37:15.502 --> 01:37:18.337
and that didn't quite work out that way.

01:37:18.422 --> 01:37:21.006
He left me.

01:37:25.180 --> 01:37:26.889
So, I...

01:37:28.851 --> 01:37:29.892
Anyway, whatever,

01:37:29.977 --> 01:37:35.022
but I ended up raising Reno on my own.
That's my boy, his name's Reno.

01:37:36.650 --> 01:37:38.359
Then I met Rainey.

01:37:39.528 --> 01:37:42.572
That was sweet.
It was really good for a while. It's just...

01:37:47.619 --> 01:37:52.248
You know, Reno was
a teenager already by then,

01:37:52.374 --> 01:37:55.543
and he was just on his way
to becoming his own man.

01:38:00.174 --> 01:38:05.678
And I haven't even heard from him
in two years.

01:38:09.391 --> 01:38:11.642
I don't even know where he is.

01:38:12.186 --> 01:38:14.604
I hope I get to meet him sometime.

01:38:17.024 --> 01:38:19.400
Do your folks know where you are?

01:38:24.323 --> 01:38:27.408
Hey, guys?
Dinner's ready if you guys are hungry.

01:38:27.493 --> 01:38:31.245
Yeah, we are. We're hungry.

01:38:34.791 --> 01:38:36.417
I'll be all right.

01:38:47.262 --> 01:38:48.971
You want to come and eat?

01:38:49.556 --> 01:38:52.975
Or we'll sit here.
Because I will sit here with you all night.

01:38:58.232 --> 01:38:59.774
Let's go. Let's go.

01:39:02.402 --> 01:39:04.487
Guys, come on. It's getting cold.

01:39:08.116 --> 01:39:13.287
Check this out. Tawdry?
Denise, that sounds like your cup of tea.

01:39:43.068 --> 01:39:47.073
That poor girl is about ready
to vault herself onto a fence post.

01:39:47.908 --> 01:39:52.245
And here you are,
the monk of Jack fucking LaLanne.

01:39:59.128 --> 01:40:03.172
- So Jan talked to you about Reno, huh?
- Yeah.

01:40:06.176 --> 01:40:09.887
Children can be pretty harsh
when it comes to their parents.

01:40:10.431 --> 01:40:12.640
You planning on seeing yours?

01:40:14.893 --> 01:40:17.228
I've only got one plan, Rainey.

01:40:18.314 --> 01:40:20.982
That would be Alaska?

01:40:21.191 --> 01:40:22.609
Alaska.

01:40:34.121 --> 01:40:35.288
Hello?

01:40:36.957 --> 01:40:40.001
- Merry Christmas.
- Come in here.

01:40:49.136 --> 01:40:51.220
My parents went into town.

01:40:52.890 --> 01:40:53.890
No.

01:40:54.224 --> 01:40:57.393
Yeah. They went to call my grandma
for Christmas.

01:40:58.062 --> 01:41:00.229
No, I mean we can't do that.

01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:02.690
Why not?

01:41:09.907 --> 01:41:11.491
How old are you?

01:41:12.409 --> 01:41:13.701
Eighteen.

01:41:16.789 --> 01:41:18.289
Seventeen.

01:41:20.125 --> 01:41:22.085
What year were you born?

01:41:28.926 --> 01:41:30.593
So I'm 16.

01:41:44.692 --> 01:41:47.110
You want to do something together?

01:43:01.103 --> 01:43:05.774
You can send mail to this address
in South Dakota.

01:43:07.401 --> 01:43:11.780
I don't know when I'm going to get it,
but I'll get it.

01:43:16.076 --> 01:43:17.869
You're pretty magic.

01:43:17.953 --> 01:43:20.622
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:43:22.541 --> 01:43:24.209
And just remember

01:43:24.585 --> 01:43:29.088
if you want something in life,
reach out and grab it.

01:43:50.402 --> 01:43:52.445
- You take care, kiddo.
- You, too.

01:43:54.740 --> 01:43:57.826
- New Year's resolution?
- We'll work on it.

01:45:05.646 --> 01:45:08.481
Just get your pack
and get on out of here, okay?

01:45:09.609 --> 01:45:11.985
I don't think I could take a hug.

01:45:26.667 --> 01:45:27.667
Hey.

01:45:40.264 --> 01:45:41.348
Bye!

01:45:56.197 --> 01:46:00.784
<i>A year and a half had passed in what
Dad called "suspended animation."</i>

01:46:08.250 --> 01:46:14.214
<i>The weight of Chris' disappearance had
begun to lay down on me full-length.</i>

01:46:25.601 --> 01:46:27.852
"I have lived through much,

01:46:28.896 --> 01:46:32.649
"and now I think I have found what is
needed for happiness.

01:46:36.445 --> 01:46:39.197
"A quiet secluded life in the country,

01:46:41.075 --> 01:46:45.831
"with the possibility of being useful to
people to whom it is easy to do good,

01:46:47.583 --> 01:46:51.086
"and who are not accustomed
to have it done to them.

01:46:52.922 --> 01:46:56.049
<i>"And work which one hopes
may be of some use.</i>

01:46:57.677 --> 01:47:02.014
"Then rest, nature, books, music,

01:47:02.724 --> 01:47:04.766
"love for one's neighbor.

01:47:08.688 --> 01:47:11.148
"Such is my idea of happiness.

01:47:14.068 --> 01:47:20.657
<i>"And then, on top of all that,
you for a mate,</i>

01:47:21.826 --> 01:47:23.785
<i>"and children perhaps.</i>

01:47:25.663 --> 01:47:28.498
<i>"What more
can the heart of a man desire?"</i>

01:47:36.799 --> 01:47:41.219
<i>Comes the morning when I can feel</i>

01:47:41.304 --> 01:47:45.682
<i>That there's nothing
left to be concealed</i>

01:47:45.767 --> 01:47:50.228
<i>Moving on
A scene surreal</i>

01:47:50.313 --> 01:47:56.401
<i>But my heart will never
Never be far from here</i>

01:47:56.486 --> 01:48:00.781
<i>Sure as I'm breathing
Sure as I'm sad</i>

01:48:00.865 --> 01:48:05.368
<i>I'll keep this wisdom in my flesh</i>

01:48:05.453 --> 01:48:10.082
<i>I leave here believing
More than I had</i>

01:48:10.166 --> 01:48:13.835
<i>And there's a reason I will</i>

01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:18.131
<i>A reason I'll be back</i>

01:48:21.719 --> 01:48:26.098
<i>As I walk the hemisphere</i>

01:48:26.182 --> 01:48:30.560
<i>I got my wish to up and disappear</i>

01:48:30.645 --> 01:48:34.981
<i>I've been wounded
I've been healed</i>

01:48:35.066 --> 01:48:38.193
<i>Now for landing I've been</i>

01:48:38.277 --> 01:48:41.196
<i>Landing I've been cleared</i>

01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:45.826
<i>Sure as I'm breathing
Sure as I'm sad</i>

01:48:45.910 --> 01:48:50.288
<i>I'll keep this wisdom in my flesh</i>

01:48:50.373 --> 01:48:54.793
<i>I leave here believing
More than I had</i>

01:48:54.877 --> 01:48:58.922
<i>This love has got no ceiling</i>

01:52:06.614 --> 01:52:08.282
Where's your camp?

01:52:09.075 --> 01:52:11.618
Just out past Oh-My-God Hot Springs.

01:52:12.412 --> 01:52:15.539
I've lived in and around here
for six years now

01:52:16.082 --> 01:52:18.167
and I've never heard of any place
that goes by that name.

01:52:18.251 --> 01:52:21.211
- Show me how to get there.
- Yeah.

01:52:24.841 --> 01:52:27.468
- Ron Franz.
- Alex.

01:52:27.594 --> 01:52:29.428
Alex? Where you from, Alex?

01:52:30.347 --> 01:52:34.350
- West Virginia.
- Okay, Alex from West Virginia.

01:53:19.396 --> 01:53:24.149
Well, this is something out here.

01:53:29.030 --> 01:53:30.280
Don't you...

01:53:31.282 --> 01:53:35.994
Don't you worry about those dope
smokers and nudists down below there?

01:53:36.079 --> 01:53:39.915
No, they keep to themselves
pretty much.

01:53:39.999 --> 01:53:43.295
You strike me as a bright young man.
Am I wrong about that?

01:53:44.506 --> 01:53:46.924
I think I've got
my head on my shoulders pretty good.

01:53:47.008 --> 01:53:48.759
Well, that's what I mean.

01:53:53.432 --> 01:53:55.516
How long you been out here?

01:53:57.144 --> 01:54:00.354
- Couple of weeks.
- And before that?

01:54:00.856 --> 01:54:04.024
A lot of places.
Been moving around a lot.

01:54:05.152 --> 01:54:08.362
- Well, how old are you?
- Twenty-three.

01:54:09.281 --> 01:54:10.531
Twenty-three years old!

01:54:10.615 --> 01:54:13.617
Son, don't you think
you ought to be getting an education?

01:54:13.702 --> 01:54:16.704
And a job?
And making something of this life?

01:54:19.916 --> 01:54:21.542
Look, Mr. Franz,

01:54:22.711 --> 01:54:26.589
I think careers are a 20th century
invention, and I don't want one.

01:54:27.549 --> 01:54:31.385
You don't need to worry about me.
I have a college education.

01:54:31.636 --> 01:54:35.806
I'm not destitute.
I'm living like this by choice.

01:54:37.476 --> 01:54:41.854
- In the dirt?
- Yeah, in the dirt.

01:54:46.151 --> 01:54:49.862
- Where's your family?
- Don't have one anymore.

01:54:53.241 --> 01:54:54.742
That's a shame.

01:54:58.079 --> 01:55:00.789
Hey, Mr. Franz,
I want to show you something.

01:55:01.541 --> 01:55:06.629
Come on.

01:55:32.280 --> 01:55:37.660
It's getting a little steep.
A little high for me, kid.

01:55:39.120 --> 01:55:40.663
All right,

01:55:41.957 --> 01:55:45.251
but even from halfway out,
it's quite a sight, isn't it?

01:55:47.295 --> 01:55:52.132
From the top, you can see all the way
to the Salton Sea, too.

01:55:52.801 --> 01:55:55.219
You can see the Salton Sea
from up there?

01:55:55.512 --> 01:55:56.804
Yes, sir.

01:55:57.597 --> 01:55:58.973
My goodness.

01:56:00.058 --> 01:56:04.897
- You don't want to go up?
- Nope. I don't do these kind of things.

01:56:08.485 --> 01:56:10.903
I spent most of my life in the Army.

01:56:13.740 --> 01:56:18.494
New Year's Eve, 1957,
I was stationed in Okinawa.

01:56:19.997 --> 01:56:24.000
My wife and son were here in the States
just driving down the road,

01:56:24.084 --> 01:56:27.628
and some fella who'd had too much
to drink plowed right into them.

01:56:28.171 --> 01:56:30.172
Killed them both.

01:56:34.553 --> 01:56:39.682
Now you might think
the last thing I would do in the world

01:56:42.519 --> 01:56:44.312
is go to the whiskey.

01:56:46.023 --> 01:56:50.234
But at the time,
it felt like the only thing I could do.

01:56:50.319 --> 01:56:52.945
And I did it hard!

01:56:55.949 --> 01:56:58.451
But pretty soon I realized

01:56:59.202 --> 01:57:03.456
I wasn't doing my wife and son any good
mourning them with the bottle.

01:57:03.832 --> 01:57:07.877
So I pulled myself together
and I quit drinking,

01:57:08.545 --> 01:57:09.920
cold turkey.

01:57:11.214 --> 01:57:15.593
So since all that, this is pretty much me.

01:57:16.887 --> 01:57:19.138
Do you ever travel, Mr. Franz?

01:57:20.182 --> 01:57:23.267
No, I can't seem to get too far
from my leather.

01:57:24.978 --> 01:57:29.565
I do a lot of leather engraving.
I got a little workshop out in the garage.

01:57:29.900 --> 01:57:32.109
Between that and my pension,
I do pretty well.

01:57:32.194 --> 01:57:34.737
But every time I think
I might take a trip somewhere,

01:57:34.821 --> 01:57:38.449
I get too far behind on orders and such
to consider it.

01:57:39.326 --> 01:57:41.994
When we finish eating,
I'd love to see your workshop.

01:57:42.079 --> 01:57:43.496
- Would you?
- Oh, yeah.

01:57:43.580 --> 01:57:45.373
I was hoping you'd say that.

01:57:45.457 --> 01:57:48.417
- It's amazing how malleable this is.
- Yeah, it is.

01:57:48.502 --> 01:57:50.211
When the leather is wet you can really...

01:57:50.295 --> 01:57:51.629
- It's like butter.
- Yeah.

01:57:51.713 --> 01:57:55.257
It's amazing. And then it hardens up,
and, I mean, it stays right there.

01:58:40.305 --> 01:58:45.977
A good whack with the mallet.
Crack it down. Whack. Bang.

01:59:46.330 --> 01:59:49.999
I went to South Dakota.
I worked at a grain elevator

01:59:50.083 --> 01:59:52.627
for this guy named Wayne.
He was a really good guy.

01:59:52.711 --> 01:59:54.295
So I took the Colorado River

01:59:54.379 --> 01:59:57.673
all the way down through
the Grand Canyon and did rapids,

01:59:57.758 --> 02:00:01.385
which is by far one of
the scariest things I've ever done.

02:00:01.512 --> 02:00:06.891
And I took the Colorado down into
Mexico, Golfo, where I got stuck.

02:00:07.768 --> 02:00:10.102
Salvation Mountain. The Slabs.

02:00:11.814 --> 02:00:13.940
What's the "N" stand for?

02:00:15.567 --> 02:00:16.734
North.

02:00:18.028 --> 02:00:19.695
Alaska?

02:00:22.699 --> 02:00:25.201
Son, what the hell
are you running from?

02:00:26.328 --> 02:00:28.788
You know, I can ask you
the same question!

02:00:29.832 --> 02:00:32.250
Except I already know the answer!

02:00:33.085 --> 02:00:34.585
You do, do you?

02:00:35.337 --> 02:00:39.590
I do, Mr. Franz!
You got to get back out in the world!

02:00:40.386 --> 02:00:43.596
Get out of that lonely house,
that little workshop of yours.

02:00:43.681 --> 02:00:47.725
Get back out on the road! Really!

02:00:48.602 --> 02:00:51.229
You're going to live a long time, Ron!

02:00:51.313 --> 02:00:54.607
You should make a radical change
in your lifestyle!

02:00:55.276 --> 02:00:59.195
I mean, the core of man's spirit
comes from new experiences.

02:00:59.738 --> 02:01:03.950
And there you are, stubborn old man,
sitting on your butt.

02:01:05.077 --> 02:01:07.912
- Sitting on my butt?
- Yeah.

02:01:09.456 --> 02:01:13.877
I'll show you sitting on my butt!

02:01:13.961 --> 02:01:16.004
"Stubborn old man."

02:01:17.464 --> 02:01:19.132
I'll show you!

02:01:19.633 --> 02:01:21.843
Come on, then! Come on.

02:01:24.805 --> 02:01:27.932
Sitting on my butt? Yeah.

02:01:30.019 --> 02:01:32.186
Come on, old man. Come climbing.

02:01:32.271 --> 02:01:33.980
Sitting on my butt.

02:01:34.315 --> 02:01:35.815
Come on. Keep going!

02:01:39.653 --> 02:01:41.362
You're doing great!

02:01:46.160 --> 02:01:48.828
- Keep going. Keep going, Ron!
- Yeah!

02:01:50.581 --> 02:01:54.334
Can anybody see this?
God, are you watching this right now?

02:02:02.509 --> 02:02:03.635
Yeah.

02:02:06.680 --> 02:02:11.017
- You all right?
- You little pinhead!

02:02:28.535 --> 02:02:30.870
I'm gonna miss you when you go.

02:02:32.498 --> 02:02:36.167
I'll miss you, too, Ron.
But you're wrong if you think

02:02:36.251 --> 02:02:40.213
that the joy of life comes principally
from human relationships.

02:02:41.215 --> 02:02:43.549
God's placed it all around us.
It's in everything.

02:02:43.634 --> 02:02:46.010
It's in anything we can experience.

02:02:46.887 --> 02:02:50.390
People just need to change the way
they look at those things.

02:02:50.474 --> 02:02:52.684
Yeah, I'm gonna take stock of that.

02:02:54.561 --> 02:02:55.853
No, I am.

02:03:00.069 --> 02:03:01.152
I am.

02:03:03.531 --> 02:03:05.740
But I wanted to tell you something.

02:03:09.495 --> 02:03:12.247
From the bits and pieces I put together,

02:03:12.331 --> 02:03:16.418
you know, from what you told me about
your family, your mother and your dad.

02:03:18.421 --> 02:03:21.756
And I know you've got your problems
with the church, too.

02:03:23.676 --> 02:03:27.429
But there's some kind of bigger thing
we can all appreciate,

02:03:28.431 --> 02:03:31.641
and it sounds like
you don't mind calling it God.

02:03:37.732 --> 02:03:40.650
But when you forgive,

02:03:42.903 --> 02:03:44.154
you love.

02:03:47.908 --> 02:03:50.952
And when you love,

02:03:51.787 --> 02:03:54.372
God's light shines on you.

02:03:59.086 --> 02:04:02.797
- Holy shit.
- I told you about that language.

02:04:12.975 --> 02:04:14.476
I told you so!

02:04:17.354 --> 02:04:20.899
Where are the fucking animals now?
I'm hungry!

02:04:21.025 --> 02:04:25.236
I'm fucking hungry! I'm fucking hungry!

02:04:42.296 --> 02:04:46.049
<i>"For a moment she rediscovered
the purpose of her life.</i>

02:04:46.926 --> 02:04:50.637
<i>"She was here on earth to grasp
the meaning of its wild enchantment,</i>

02:04:50.721 --> 02:04:53.556
<i>"and to call each thing
by its right name."</i>

02:04:56.852 --> 02:04:58.520
"By its right name."

02:04:59.313 --> 02:05:01.648
What is this? What is this one?

02:05:04.693 --> 02:05:09.656
<i>This is Viburnum edule.
Viburnum edule.</i>

02:05:14.495 --> 02:05:17.497
<i>Hedysarum alpinum.</i>

02:05:19.585 --> 02:05:24.297
Hedysarum alpinum is wild potato root.
Wild potato root.

02:05:26.551 --> 02:05:30.220
<i>Epilobium angustifolium. Fireweed.</i>

02:08:25.606 --> 02:08:28.525
Fuck it all. Fuck it all!

02:11:06.936 --> 02:11:07.978
Hi.

02:11:08.062 --> 02:11:11.231
What are you doing up?
It's 3:30 in the morning.

02:11:11.566 --> 02:11:14.776
I heard you get off the couch
about a half hour ago.

02:11:16.070 --> 02:11:19.781
Had a funny feeling
you might not be here for our breakfast.

02:11:23.995 --> 02:11:28.916
I'm gonna drive you 100 miles to
someplace where you can catch a train,

02:11:29.667 --> 02:11:34.379
a plane or hitch a ride
and not get stuck out in this desert.

02:11:35.590 --> 02:11:39.593
I'd take you all the way to Alaska
if I didn't have an 8:00 mass.

02:11:39.928 --> 02:11:43.347
- Ron, you don't have to do that.
- I want to do it.

02:11:44.224 --> 02:11:47.226
Get you started on this thing of yours.

02:11:47.685 --> 02:11:49.728
- On my great...
- I know.

02:11:50.396 --> 02:11:52.940
On your great Alaskan adventure.

02:11:53.733 --> 02:11:56.443
Here. Here's a machete.

02:11:58.780 --> 02:12:03.617
Collapsible fishing pole, a few other
odds and ends I stuck in there for you.

02:12:07.080 --> 02:12:09.498
- Ron...
- Just take it.

02:12:10.875 --> 02:12:13.710
I'll get dressed
and meet you in the truck.

02:13:09.978 --> 02:13:11.604
Well, my friend.

02:13:14.065 --> 02:13:15.149
Yep.

02:13:19.529 --> 02:13:22.031
I had an idea.

02:13:23.158 --> 02:13:27.828
You know, my mother was an only child

02:13:28.705 --> 02:13:30.539
and so was my father,

02:13:31.166 --> 02:13:35.461
and I was their only child,

02:13:38.840 --> 02:13:41.550
so when I'm gone,
I'm the end of the line.

02:13:42.594 --> 02:13:44.720
My family will be finished.

02:13:48.391 --> 02:13:53.729
What do you say you let me adopt you?

02:13:58.068 --> 02:14:02.196
I can be, say, your grandfather.

02:14:06.576 --> 02:14:08.202
Ron,

02:14:09.788 --> 02:14:13.582
could we talk about this
when I get back from Alaska?

02:14:13.958 --> 02:14:15.751
Would that be okay?

02:14:23.051 --> 02:14:26.261
Yeah, yeah. We can do that. Yeah.

02:14:31.226 --> 02:14:32.559
All right, Ron.

02:14:34.938 --> 02:14:36.271
Thank you.

02:15:25.407 --> 02:15:27.616
<i>What did his voice sound like now?</i>

02:15:28.869 --> 02:15:31.078
<i>What would he tell about now?</i>

02:15:31.538 --> 02:15:34.665
...nine, ten.

02:16:24.299 --> 02:16:29.261
<i>I realized that the words to my thoughts
were of less and less meaning.</i>

02:16:29.346 --> 02:16:31.472
<i>Chris was writing his story,</i>

02:16:32.933 --> 02:16:35.934
<i>and it had to be Chris who would tell it.</i>

02:18:56.702 --> 02:18:59.163
<i>"To call each thing by its right name.</i>

02:19:04.044 --> 02:19:05.753
<i>"By its right name."</i>

02:19:56.932 --> 02:19:58.975
<i>What if I were smiling</i>

02:20:01.437 --> 02:20:03.771
<i>and running into your arms?</i>

02:20:26.378 --> 02:20:28.129
<i>Would you see then</i>

02:20:29.305 --> 02:20:35.415
