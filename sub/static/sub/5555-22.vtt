were larger than the ones up front.

They got a frequency jammer, Castle.
We're cut off.

09:13.282 --> 09:14.415
[Engines rev, tires screech]

09:14.450 --> 09:15.984
Uh-oh.

09:24.345 --> 09:25.593
Open fire!

09:30.401 --> 09:31.598
Castle!

09:47.161 --> 09:48.362
Sniper!

09:51.290 --> 09:52.438
Ohh!

10:01.663 --> 10:03.029
I don't have a clear shot.

10:07.467 --> 10:08.432
I'm out.

10:08.468 --> 10:09.634
Yeah, same.

10:21.513 --> 10:23.147
Get in!

10:23.182 --> 10:24.214
Mason?

10:41.088 --> 10:42.790
We're out of here.

10:51.743 --> 10:53.209
No one's following. We're clear.

10:53.244 --> 10:55.543
That was amazing!

10:55.579 --> 10:58.113
Mason, you, sir,
are quite literally a lifesaver.

10:58.148 --> 10:59.547
And talk about a getaway vehicle.

10:59.583 --> 11:01.983
A Korean barbecue taco truck?
Are you serious?

11:02.019 --> 11:03.151
Is anyone hungry right now?

11:03.187 --> 11:05.781
Because I could totally whip
up some kimchi tostadas.

11:06.990 --> 11:08.656
- Who are you?
- Whoa. Easy now.

11:08.692 --> 11:09.524
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, no, no.

11:09.559 --> 11:11.959
Kate, Kate, Kate. This is Mason Wood.

11:11.994 --> 11:13.627
He's the head of the
Greatest Detective Society.

11:13.662 --> 11:15.295
I told you about meeting him in L.A.

11:15.331 --> 11:16.563
That doesn't mean that we can trust him.

11:16.599 --> 11:17.998
Fine, don't trust me, but would you mind

11:18.034 --> 11:19.633
pointing that thing away from me?

11:19.668 --> 11:20.901
It makes me just a bit nervous.

11:20.937 --> 11:22.970
Don't worry. She's out of bullets.

11:23.005 --> 11:24.338
Why would you tell him that?

11:24.373 --> 11:26.841
Because he saved our lives,
and he's a friend!

11:26.876 --> 11:28.075
Who just happened to
be at the right place

11:28.111 --> 11:30.744
at the right time with the right
Korean barbecue taco truck?

11:30.779 --> 11:32.245
I don't think so.

11:32.280 --> 11:33.379
She does make a good point.

11:33.414 --> 11:34.480
Mason, what are you doing here?

11:34.515 --> 11:36.320
Your mother sent me.

11:37.252 --> 11:38.852
My mother?!

11:39.330 --> 11:40.553
You know Martha?

11:40.588 --> 11:42.488
No, not that mother... The other one.

11:42.523 --> 11:44.000
The, uh, stepmother, Rita.

11:45.060 --> 11:47.179
How do you know her?

11:47.895 --> 11:51.529
Once upon a time I was a lawyer
with the State Department,

11:51.565 --> 11:53.665
and, on an overseas assignment,

11:53.700 --> 11:56.769
Rita was in my convoy
going to the embassy.

11:56.804 --> 11:59.437
We were hit. We were taken hostage.

11:59.473 --> 12:02.507
If it hadn't been for Rita, I...

12:02.542 --> 12:04.008
Look, I just owe her, all right?

12:04.043 --> 12:05.676
And when she called
and said that you two

12:05.711 --> 12:07.611
were sticking your noses
into something dangerous

12:07.647 --> 12:10.447
and needed a babysitter, I said okay.

12:10.483 --> 12:11.715
Did she tell you about LokSat,
how it's connected...

12:11.751 --> 12:13.417
Okay, just stop right there.

12:13.452 --> 12:14.718
Now, whatever this is

12:14.754 --> 12:17.188
and whoever you have
obviously pissed off,

12:17.223 --> 12:18.722
the less I know about this,

12:18.758 --> 12:21.024
the better my chances
are of staying alive.

12:21.059 --> 12:22.759
Remember, I'm just a babysitter,

12:22.795 --> 12:26.596
so I'll change your diapers
and feed you your bottle and...

12:26.631 --> 12:29.266
save you from a strike
force of armed mercenaries,

12:29.301 --> 12:31.134
but I am not joining your fight.

12:31.170 --> 12:32.602
Here, give me your cellphone.

12:32.637 --> 12:34.704
Hit squad could find us on it.
I'm gonna dump them.

12:36.913 --> 12:38.240
Here.

12:38.276 --> 12:39.708
You're welcome to take
anything you need.

12:39.743 --> 12:41.177
It's all untraceable.

12:43.247 --> 12:44.646
Good luck to both of you.

12:44.682 --> 12:46.081
How do we thank you?

12:46.117 --> 12:47.817
You solved my friend's
murder back in L.A.

12:47.852 --> 12:49.351
Let's call it even.

12:50.855 --> 12:52.221
Here.

12:58.295 --> 12:59.794
How did that happen?

12:59.830 --> 13:01.329
We were careful.

13:01.364 --> 13:03.731
LokSat must've discovered
that Caleb betrayed him

13:03.766 --> 13:05.233
and then got wind of us.

13:05.268 --> 13:07.902
So LokSat killed Caleb,
and then all he had to do

13:07.938 --> 13:09.804
was hack in to Caleb's account

13:09.840 --> 13:11.571
and send a fake e-mail to Vikram

13:11.606 --> 13:13.073
agreeing to make that drop.

13:13.108 --> 13:15.976
LokSat is going to keep coming for us.

13:16.011 --> 13:17.777
Or worse,
he's gonna come after our families.

13:17.813 --> 13:19.679
Okay, well, my dad's away on business,

13:19.715 --> 13:20.814
so he's okay for now,

13:20.850 --> 13:22.749
but you got to get Hayley
to pick up Alexis and Martha

13:22.784 --> 13:24.684
and take them to the
P.I. office safe room.

13:24.720 --> 13:26.419
What about Vikram? He's in danger, too.

13:26.455 --> 13:27.687
I'll track him down.

13:27.723 --> 13:29.388
Then we'll meet up,
and we'll make a plan.

13:30.558 --> 13:32.325
No, no, no. Come on.
Don't give me that face.

13:32.360 --> 13:35.027
Just say,
"We'll meet at the P.I. office."

13:35.063 --> 13:37.363
We'll meet at the P.I. office.

13:37.398 --> 13:38.831
Okay.

13:43.537 --> 13:44.837
I love you.

13:44.872 --> 13:46.004
I love you, too.

13:48.876 --> 13:50.842
- Yo.
- Hey.

13:50.878 --> 13:52.978
Still haven't found any
rear or mid-engine cars yet,

13:53.013 --> 13:55.881
but I still have several traffic
cams to scrub through so...

13:55.916 --> 13:56.915
Check this out.

13:56.950 --> 13:59.217
CSU uncovered a message
in that burned-out trunk.

13:59.253 --> 14:00.952
Now, I think it was from Caleb.

14:00.988 --> 14:02.853
He must've scratched it when
the killer was driving him

14:02.889 --> 14:03.888
to that empty parking lot.

14:03.923 --> 14:06.590
He carved it into the metal.
It survived the blaze.

14:09.595 --> 14:12.363
Was he trying to I.D. his killer for us?

14:12.398 --> 14:13.898
"R-T H-D M-N"?

14:13.933 --> 14:15.032
Right-hand man.

14:15.067 --> 14:17.001
Well, whose right-hand man?

14:17.036 --> 14:18.369
Vikram: LokSat's.

14:27.913 --> 14:29.879
Who's LokSat?

14:29.915 --> 14:31.347
Caleb left that message for Beckett.

14:31.383 --> 14:33.682
You're still not answering the question,
Vikram.

14:33.718 --> 14:34.918
Who the hell is LokSat?

14:34.953 --> 14:37.585
The Big Bad Wolf.

14:37.621 --> 14:39.388
The person behind Senator Bracken,
Allison Hyde,

14:39.423 --> 14:40.822
the hit squads... Every terrible thing

14:40.857 --> 14:41.924
that's happened to me and Beckett

14:41.959 --> 14:43.225
for the past nine months.

14:45.262 --> 14:46.694
You shouldn't have told them.

14:50.901 --> 14:52.167
Yeah.

14:52.202 --> 14:53.667
<i>You</i> should've.

14:55.738 --> 14:58.105
Now tell us everything.

14:58.141 --> 14:59.407
Come on.

15:07.984 --> 15:10.183
No, no, no, no, no, no.
He's okay, he's okay, he's okay.

15:10.218 --> 15:11.985
It's about bloody time you got here.

15:14.489 --> 15:16.289
[Gasps] Oh, Richard. Darling.

15:16.325 --> 15:18.558
Oh, thank goodness you're all right.

15:18.593 --> 15:19.859
[Sighs]

15:19.894 --> 15:20.660
Thank you.

15:20.695 --> 15:22.929
- Where's Katherine?
- She's coming.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.564
So, what's going on?

15:24.599 --> 15:25.798
W-Why are we on lockdown?

15:25.834 --> 15:26.999
You didn't tell them?

15:27.034 --> 15:29.568
Considering the danger,
I didn't think it was my place.

15:29.603 --> 15:31.036
Dad, does this have something to do with

15:31.072 --> 15:33.572
what you found out in L.A.?

15:33.607 --> 15:35.274
Of course. I apologize.

15:35.309 --> 15:36.775
Uh, y-you both have a right to know.

15:36.810 --> 15:38.577
This all started when...

15:38.612 --> 15:41.880
So, Caleb was burned alive
because LokSat found out

15:41.915 --> 15:43.982
that he switched sides
and was working with you?

15:44.017 --> 15:47.151
Yeah, and now LokSat is going
after Vikram, Castle, me...

15:47.187 --> 15:48.819
Anyone that knows anything about them.

15:48.855 --> 15:50.221
So, I need you guys to forget

15:50.256 --> 15:51.922
everything that you just heard.

15:51.958 --> 15:54.125
Oh, no, afraid we can't do that, boss.

15:54.160 --> 15:56.827
You guys,
LokSat took out my entire AG team.

15:56.863 --> 15:58.396
I'm not gonna let that happen to you.

15:58.431 --> 15:59.497
And we're not gonna let you go to war

15:59.532 --> 16:00.664
without your two best soldiers.

16:00.700 --> 16:02.665
Right now there's no war to be fought.

16:02.701 --> 16:03.566
Castle and I are probably

16:03.602 --> 16:05.435
gonna have to disappear for awhile...

16:05.471 --> 16:07.504
At least until we find
another lead on LokSat.

16:07.539 --> 16:09.172
Beckett, we already have one.

16:09.208 --> 16:11.908
Caleb I.D.'d his killer.

16:11.943 --> 16:13.943
LokSat's right-hand man.
You know what this means?

16:13.979 --> 16:16.113
Catching Caleb's killer will
put us on a path to LokSat.

16:16.148 --> 16:18.314
[Door opens] Guys, I got him.

16:18.349 --> 16:20.483
- The right-hand man?
- Yeah.

16:20.518 --> 16:22.818
I found a credit-card hit
off of Caleb's financials.

16:22.853 --> 16:24.253
He ate alone at a diner last night.

16:24.288 --> 16:25.821
They just e-mailed me
the security-cam footage

16:25.856 --> 16:26.622
from the parking lot.

16:26.657 --> 16:27.689
That's Caleb with the briefcase?

16:27.725 --> 16:30.959
Yes. And that's got to be
LokSat's right-hand man.

16:33.031 --> 16:35.096
So,
this is right before he torched Caleb.

16:35.132 --> 16:36.498
He never had a chance.

16:38.801 --> 16:40.201
Can you run facial recognition?

16:40.237 --> 16:42.303
No, we only have his profile.

16:43.573 --> 16:46.541
LokSat and his cleaner have
had us running for cover

16:46.576 --> 16:48.209
like they're the hunters.

16:48.245 --> 16:50.069
That's good.

16:50.926 --> 16:52.779
They'll never see us coming.

16:55.357 --> 16:56.999
That is not what we agreed to.

16:57.092 --> 16:59.659
You were supposed to grab Vikram
and then come straight here.

16:59.694 --> 17:01.427
I-I know, but that was before the guys

17:01.462 --> 17:02.828
were brought in on this

17:02.863 --> 17:05.431
and before we got actionable
evidence on LokSat.

17:05.465 --> 17:06.932
I can't leave now.

17:06.967 --> 17:08.548
Well, then I'm coming down there.

17:08.720 --> 17:10.368
I... No. No. Absolutely not.

17:10.404 --> 17:12.371
You can't risk coming out in the open.

17:12.406 --> 17:15.140
And you can't risk staying in the open.

17:15.175 --> 17:18.476
Castle, I am in one of the
safest buildings in the city...

17:18.512 --> 17:20.444
A police station... A-and better yet,

17:20.480 --> 17:23.674
my police station with my cops.

17:25.018 --> 17:26.851
Nothing's gonna happen
to me while I'm here.

17:26.886 --> 17:28.920
[Knock on door] Captain Beckett.

17:28.955 --> 17:30.754
Babe, I-I got to go.

17:30.790 --> 17:32.023
Will you stay at the precinct?

17:32.058 --> 17:33.757
Yes. I promise.

17:33.793 --> 17:35.928
I'll stay here.

17:37.300 --> 17:38.777
I love you.

17:38.975 --> 17:40.598
I love you, too.

17:42.400 --> 17:44.367
[Cellphone beeps]

17:44.925 --> 17:46.878
- What do you got?
- We found him.

17:47.906 --> 17:50.140
So, we scrubbed through
every available traffic cam

17:50.175 --> 17:53.042
around the crime scene,
and we were only able to find

17:53.077 --> 17:55.845
one car with staggered wheels
due to being mid-engine.

17:55.880 --> 17:58.219
Which matches the tire impressions
we found at the crime scene.

17:58.301 --> 18:01.016
This is the car five blocks from
the vacant lot, driving away.

18:01.052 --> 18:02.985
No plates. So, how do we know

18:03.020 --> 18:05.020
that LokSat's right-hand
man is driving the car?

18:05.056 --> 18:07.356
Just wait. Using traffic cams,

18:07.391 --> 18:10.108
we can follow the car to
what we assume is his house.

18:13.663 --> 18:15.529
[Mouse clicking, computer beeping]

18:20.770 --> 18:21.736
That's him, all right.

18:21.771 --> 18:22.803
Who owns the home?

18:22.839 --> 18:24.638
A shell corporation.

18:24.674 --> 18:26.336
Now watch.

18:28.944 --> 18:31.845
This is a live shot. He's still there.

18:31.881 --> 18:33.981
All right, grab your tac gear.
We're going to that house.

18:34.016 --> 18:35.815
Excuse me, Beckett.

18:35.851 --> 18:37.918
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but didn't you just tell Castle

18:37.953 --> 18:39.652
that you're staying put
here at the precinct?

18:39.688 --> 18:40.754
You think I'm gonna
send you into harm's way

18:40.789 --> 18:41.855
while I'm sitting safe behind a desk?

18:41.890 --> 18:43.589
No. Not gonna happen.

18:43.624 --> 18:45.824
You got a target on your back, we don't.

18:45.860 --> 18:47.459
You're staying here.

18:49.697 --> 18:51.764
Uh, he does know that I'm captain,
right?

18:51.799 --> 18:52.865
Yes, ma'am.

18:52.901 --> 18:55.201
You can fire us both for
insubordination if you want.

18:55.236 --> 18:57.207
Otherwise, we got this.

19:03.476 --> 19:07.112
A feisty Merlot, an elegant spread,

19:07.147 --> 19:08.880
delightful company...

19:08.916 --> 19:10.949
If I wasn't scared out of my mind,

19:10.984 --> 19:12.583
this would be a lovely afternoon.

19:12.619 --> 19:14.386
I should be with Kate.

19:14.421 --> 19:16.453
I promised her we'd take
down LokSat together.

19:16.488 --> 19:18.455
You also promised you'd stay here.

19:21.460 --> 19:23.394
- I'm going to the precinct.
- Oh, no.

19:23.429 --> 19:25.862
- I'll be fine. Don't worry.
- I don't think...

19:25.898 --> 19:27.298
Hey, it's okay. [Sighs]

19:27.333 --> 19:29.066

LokSat's people are CIA,

21:36.269 --> 21:41.038
which means they are experts
at tactical subterfuge.

21:41.074 --> 21:44.175
My guess is "Mr. Right-Hand Man"
anticipated our ability

21:44.210 --> 21:46.444
to track down his vehicle
from the crime scene,

I understand that, as a writer,
the naming of a thing

22:50.272 --> 22:52.072
would seem to be of
paramount importance,

my name is the least consequential thing

22:55.343 --> 22:56.742

passive cellphone signals

that served the empty house.

from the crime scene to the house,

started to shrink until...

32:05.936 --> 32:06.869
I can't let you in.

32:06.904 --> 32:08.537
I don't care if it's
protected by the Hulk.

32:08.572 --> 32:09.872
We're gonna tear this place apart.

32:10.875 --> 32:13.209
[Indistinct shouting]

32:18.983 --> 32:20.549
Where is this guy?

32:20.584 --> 32:22.417
Where is he?!

32:22.452 --> 32:24.785
What, no alcohol swab this time?

32:24.821 --> 32:29.090
No need. This stuff will
kill you in about 12 seconds.

32:29.126 --> 32:34.195
Or... and just roll with me on this...
we could skip it.

32:34.231 --> 32:36.864
There's no reason this
has to end in tragedy.

32:36.900 --> 32:38.798
Everything ends in tragedy,

32:38.834 --> 32:41.535
even an epic love story like yours.

32:45.607 --> 32:47.874
NYPD! Hands in the air now!

32:47.910 --> 32:49.576
Of course. I just need to turn this...

32:49.611 --> 32:50.577
Ryan!

32:50.612 --> 32:52.046
Aah!

32:52.814 --> 32:54.881
- You okay?
- Mason Wood is LokSat.

32:54.917 --> 32:55.748
He's going after Beckett.

32:55.783 --> 32:56.649
He's gonna kill her.
We have to warn her.

32:56.684 --> 32:58.251
Dispatch, this is Esposito.
I need backup.

32:58.286 --> 32:59.718
[Static]

32:59.754 --> 33:01.387
[Chuckling] This
building is a black site.

33:01.423 --> 33:03.789
All cell and radio
communications are jammed.

33:03.824 --> 33:05.624
We got to go.

33:05.660 --> 33:06.759
Let's move!

33:12.766 --> 33:14.299
Go.

33:23.944 --> 33:24.943
Call them off!

33:24.978 --> 33:27.512
They wouldn't listen even
if I asked them to...

33:27.548 --> 33:28.447
Which I won't.

33:28.482 --> 33:30.147
Where is Mason taking
Beckett to kill her?

33:30.183 --> 33:31.648
I have no idea.

33:31.684 --> 33:32.783
We'll see.

33:36.355 --> 33:37.621
[Grunting]

33:48.400 --> 33:50.766
I sure hope I get the correct dosage

33:50.802 --> 33:54.437
because forgetting to
breathe can be such a drag.

33:54.473 --> 33:57.840
Now you're gonna tell me
everything I want to know.

34:02.013 --> 34:04.012
[Vehicle approaches]

34:19.766 --> 34:22.252
Where is Mason taking Beckett?

34:27.478 --> 34:28.864
Where?

34:31.543 --> 34:32.708
Here.

34:32.745 --> 34:37.993
There's a kill room in the
basement with an incinerator.

34:38.451 --> 34:40.551
That's where you were
going to end up afterwards.

34:40.585 --> 34:42.085
How do I get a message to Beckett?

34:42.120 --> 34:43.880
You can't. I told you.

34:43.962 --> 34:45.755
They shut down all the signals

34:45.790 --> 34:47.389
the second the police arrived.

34:47.425 --> 34:49.257
How do we get out of here?

34:49.293 --> 34:52.702
You don't.
That door is the only way out.

34:52.784 --> 34:55.331
And they have more bullets than you.

35:00.204 --> 35:03.772
You and Mr. Castle have quite a bond...

35:03.807 --> 35:06.341
Unusual in your line of work.

35:06.377 --> 35:09.978
Yeah, well, I'm crazy for him.
He's the love of my life.

35:10.013 --> 35:12.347
And he understands the
sacrifices that I have to make

35:12.383 --> 35:14.148
to do this job so...

35:14.184 --> 35:18.352
Clearly, whomever you're
up against is quite deadly.

35:18.388 --> 35:21.288
You ever consider just walking away?

35:21.323 --> 35:23.457
Every day.

35:23.493 --> 35:24.625
Why didn't you?

35:24.660 --> 35:27.194
I took an oath.

35:27.229 --> 35:29.397
People that I cared about were murdered,

35:29.432 --> 35:31.866
and they deserve justice.

35:31.901 --> 35:34.653
Must be hard carrying that weight.

35:35.537 --> 35:38.170
I don't carry it alone.

35:38.206 --> 35:40.161
Here we are.

36:08.535 --> 36:10.000
The wet wall.

36:23.149 --> 36:24.415
What are you doing?!

36:24.451 --> 36:26.516
That's the street side!
You can't get out!

36:26.552 --> 36:29.252
We don't have to get out! We can get in!

36:29.287 --> 36:30.587
We can escape down there!

36:30.622 --> 36:32.121
If we stop shooting, they're coming in!

36:32.157 --> 36:34.157
Don't worry about us! Go get Beckett!

36:55.012 --> 36:57.279
So, who is this guy we're going to see?

36:57.314 --> 37:01.716
Oh, he's... sort of a Milo Minderbinder.

37:01.751 --> 37:03.718
Owes me for retrieving some things

37:03.753 --> 37:05.386
that were stolen from him.

37:11.027 --> 37:12.760
He's gonna meet us down here.

37:12.796 --> 37:14.295
I told him you were coming.

37:14.330 --> 37:16.411
You better let me do all
the talking in the...

37:18.077 --> 37:20.233
Pull the gun out of your pocket -
two fingers.

37:20.268 --> 37:21.401
Put it on the ground.

37:21.436 --> 37:23.403
Knock it off!

37:23.438 --> 37:24.972
I know it's you.

37:25.007 --> 37:28.441
Now, gun on the floor... Nice and slow.

37:28.477 --> 37:33.813
I was, uh, worried you might
be too smart to fall for this.

37:33.848 --> 37:35.314
What's in the other pocket?

37:35.349 --> 37:38.150
Oh, this? It's just insurance.

37:40.388 --> 37:41.554
See, mine is made of plastic,

37:41.589 --> 37:44.590
so it's unaffected by the
electromagnet in the ceiling.

37:46.895 --> 37:49.450
And I'm afraid I have some
more bad news for you.

37:49.483 --> 37:51.594
Your husband's dead.

37:53.366 --> 37:54.499
You're lying.

37:54.535 --> 37:55.934
No, I'm not.

37:55.969 --> 37:58.623
He died about the same
time I was picking you up.

37:58.772 --> 38:00.972
As a matter of fact,
his body is in the furnace

38:01.007 --> 38:03.942
behind you there,
being reduced to a few pounds of ashes.

38:07.013 --> 38:08.813
I think it's very fitting
that your lives together

38:08.848 --> 38:11.386
end in fire, don't you?

38:12.151 --> 38:14.752
I'm not going in there without a fight.

38:14.787 --> 38:16.987
That's very brave of you.

38:17.022 --> 38:18.956
But it won't be much of a fight.

38:18.991 --> 38:20.658
Drop the gun!

38:20.693 --> 38:23.126
Or I will kill you.

38:23.162 --> 38:24.494
Castle, stand back!

38:34.673 --> 38:36.576
[Gun clatters]

38:53.190 --> 38:54.356
Woman: <i>Meanwhile, in a dramatic scene,</i>

38:54.392 --> 38:57.959
<i>dozens of local and federal
law-enforcement officials</i>

38:57.995 --> 39:00.060
<i>descended on a building
in Midtown tonight,</i>

39:00.096 --> 39:02.563
<i>rescuing several police officers</i>

39:02.599 --> 39:06.591
<i>and arresting almost a dozen people.</i>

39:07.053 --> 39:08.903
How long before the CIA
connection comes out?

39:08.938 --> 39:11.906
Not long. It's too big a
story for the agency to bury.

39:11.941 --> 39:13.441
Get ready for hearings out the wazoo.

39:13.476 --> 39:14.876
Yeah.

39:14.911 --> 39:16.175
So, that's it.

39:16.211 --> 39:17.277
We're finally in the clear.

39:17.312 --> 39:19.212
Yeah, so we're gonna go to
a bar and celebrate, yeah?

39:19.247 --> 39:21.480
Okay, have fun.

39:21.917 --> 39:24.684
So, you handing in your resignation?

39:24.720 --> 39:25.952
No.

39:25.987 --> 39:27.401
Boring is overrated.

39:27.500 --> 39:29.122
Yo, Vikram, you coming?

39:29.157 --> 39:30.857
It's 7:00 in the morning.

39:30.893 --> 39:32.392
- It's New York City.
- Yeah.

39:32.427 --> 39:34.059
[Laughs]

39:37.998 --> 39:39.197
Hey!

39:39.233 --> 39:41.133
I'm gonna yell at you later.

39:41.168 --> 39:43.936
But for now,
I'm just glad you're both okay.

39:43.971 --> 39:45.604
Oh, thank you.

39:45.640 --> 39:48.206
Hey, Lanie. You coming? Come on.

39:48.242 --> 39:50.475
- Oh. I'll check you later.
- Okay.

40:01.688 --> 40:03.154
[Sighs] Ohh!

40:03.189 --> 40:04.923
Feel like I could sleep for a week.

40:04.958 --> 40:06.157
How about some breakfast first?

40:06.192 --> 40:07.223
Best way to start off a hibernation.

40:07.259 --> 40:10.126
Uh, you know what?
Uh, why don't we just order in?

40:10.162 --> 40:11.127
You don't have to cook.

40:11.163 --> 40:12.262
I love cooking for you.

40:12.297 --> 40:14.331
And I love when you cook for me.

40:14.366 --> 40:16.299
I'm gonna go change.

40:16.335 --> 40:17.674
All right.

40:31.182 --> 40:32.414
Hey, Beckett!

40:32.450 --> 40:34.784
Yeah?

40:34.819 --> 40:36.686
If Mason had an incinerator
in the basement,

40:36.721 --> 40:38.688
why wouldn't he just dispose
of Caleb's body there?

40:38.723 --> 40:39.589
Ohh!

40:41.625 --> 40:43.191
I told Mason that you
would figure it out.

40:43.226 --> 40:44.058
Castle?

40:44.094 --> 40:45.861
But the old man wouldn't listen to me.

40:45.896 --> 40:47.362
Caleb, don't...

40:47.397 --> 40:49.430
Sorry, Rick,
but how am I gonna enjoy my retirement

40:49.466 --> 40:50.832
with you and the missus hunting me?

40:50.868 --> 40:52.300
Castle!

40:59.976 --> 41:01.842
[Breathing heavily]

41:24.065 --> 41:26.098
[Both grunting]

41:36.410 --> 41:38.243
Well, guess this is it.

41:38.278 --> 41:39.310
Doesn't have to be.

41:39.346 --> 41:41.079
We could, uh, go to dinner,

41:41.114 --> 41:42.247
debrief each other.

41:42.282 --> 41:44.650
Why, Castle? So I can be
another one of your conquests?

41:44.685 --> 41:46.552
Or I could be one of yours.

41:46.587 --> 41:48.253
It was nice to meet you, Castle.

41:48.288 --> 41:50.755
It's too bad. It would've been great.

41:50.790 --> 41:52.389
You have no idea.

42:10.442 --> 42:13.076
Castle: Every writer needs inspiration.

42:13.111 --> 42:14.711
And I found mine.

42:14.746 --> 42:16.412
Beckett: Always.

42:16.448 --> 42:18.247
Always.
