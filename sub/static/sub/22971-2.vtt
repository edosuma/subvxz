You know as well as I, Usurna,
the pieces cannot be destroyed.

No... but they can be thrown
into a hole so deep

01:21.206 --> 01:24.083
that no living thing
can hope to find them.

01:24.167 --> 01:27.670
And I suppose you know of such a place.
I cannot agree to this!

01:27.754 --> 01:29.506
You are signing the boy's death warrant!

He signed it himself the moment
he crossed into the Darklands.

The edict has already been made.

Why would a book about the thing
that killed Aaarrrgghh!!! Help us now?

03:50.063 --> 03:52.899
Because, Tobias, if we can uncover
who created the poison,

03:52.982 --> 03:55.068
perhaps we can find
who holds the antidote.

but, to go against the Elder Word,
is to court treason, war.

in one of the crates
