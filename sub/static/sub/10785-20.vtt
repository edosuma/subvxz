OF MEDICAL SITUATION.

20:52.625 --> 20:54.625
WELL, IT'S THE LOGICAL
PLACE TO GO, ANDIE.

A WACKO FOR A GIRLFRIEND,

FOR THINGS

21:07.917 --> 21:09.625
OK. CAN YOU AT LEAST
EXPLAIN THESE?

21:11.583 --> 21:15.291

I'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

21:15.291 --> 21:16.917

YOU HAD THEM OUT,

21:16.917 --> 21:18.125
AND YOU WERE
GOING THROUGH THEM. WHY?

21:18.125 --> 21:19.959
IT'S NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

21:19.959 --> 21:21.917
ANDIE, YOU CHANGED
YOUR HAIR BACK

21:21.917 --> 21:23.667
TO LOOK LIKE IT DOES
IN THESE PHOTOS OF YOU
AND YOUR BROTHERS.

21:23.667 --> 21:25.583
AND?

21:25.583 --> 21:27.291
AND COMING ON THE HEELS
OF A MONTH

21:27.291 --> 21:28.917
WHEN YOU
HAVE BEEN ACTING
ANYTHING BUT NORMAL,

21:28.917 --> 21:30.458
I JUST FIND IT
A LITTLE ODD

21:30.458 --> 21:31.959
THAT YOU WOULD ALL OF
A SUDDEN REVERT BACK
TO A HAIRSTYLE

21:31.959 --> 21:33.250
YOU HAD 3 YEARS AGO.

21:33.250 --> 21:36.625
OK. SO THAT'S WHAT
THIS IS ALL ABOUT?

21:36.625 --> 21:40.125
YOU'RE FREAKING OUT
BECAUSE I WENT BACK
TO AN OLD HAIRSTYLE.

21:40.125 --> 21:42.041
WHICH ONE OF US HAS
THE PROBLEM HERE?

21:44.333 --> 21:45.959
JUST TELL ME
THAT YOUR HAIR

21:45.959 --> 21:48.083
HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THESE PICTURES.

21:49.333 --> 21:50.625
GIVE ME BACK THE BOOK.

21:50.625 --> 21:52.083
WHY ARE YOU
ACTING LIKE THIS?

21:52.083 --> 21:54.125
I SAID, GIVE ME
BACK THE BOOK!

22:02.834 --> 22:05.166

STAY HERE IF YOU WANT.

22:07.625 --> 22:09.792

WILLING TO BET

ANYTHING TO DO WITH FILM,

INTO A FIGHT,

24:07.583 --> 24:10.208

IS WHAT HAPPENED.

IS WRONG.

TALKING TO HERSELF.

24:23.250 --> 24:24.834
I MEAN, SHE SAID
SHE WASN'T,

24:24.834 --> 24:26.250
BUT I HEARD HER.

24:26.250 --> 24:27.333
SO DID I.

24:27.333 --> 24:28.959
TONIGHT, I MEAN,

24:28.959 --> 24:30.458
SHE WAS IN THE KITCHEN,

24:30.458 --> 24:32.250
AND I THOUGHT SHE WAS
TALKING TO SOMEBODY
ON THE PHONE.

24:32.250 --> 24:33.250
TALKING WITH WHO?

24:33.250 --> 24:34.875
I DON'T KNOW.

24:34.875 --> 24:35.959
I MEAN, I DIDN'T HEAR
THE WHOLE CONVERSATION,

24:35.959 --> 24:37.834
BUT IT SOUNDED LIKE

24:37.834 --> 24:39.917
SHE WAS TALKING
TO SOMEBODY NAMED BROWN.

24:39.917 --> 24:41.959
YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS.

24:41.959 --> 24:44.250
THAT'S MY NAME FOR TIM.

I COULDN'T
PRONOUNCE "TIMOTHY,"

24:49.500 --> 24:52.000
SO I CALLED HIM
BY MY FAVORITE COLOR.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.250
BROWN.

24:58.250 --> 25:01.000
YOU THINK I'M CRAZY,
BUT I'M NOT.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.291

25:31.834 --> 25:34.542

OUT OF CURIOSITY,

25:34.542 --> 25:36.291
WHAT EXACTLY
WAS THE MOST
LACKING THING

25:36.291 --> 25:37.917
ABOUT DAWSON'S FILM?

25:37.917 --> 25:40.166
OH, GOD. DO WE HAVE
TO GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN?

25:40.166 --> 25:41.834
UH, NO, WE DON'T.

25:41.834 --> 25:43.166

25:43.166 --> 25:44.417
JOEY.

25:44.417 --> 25:46.542
I'M SORRY, MR. LEERY,
BUT THERE'S OBVIOUSLY

25:46.542 --> 25:48.875
A SERIOUS UNDERCURRENT
OF TENSION BETWEEN
DAWSON AND MISS KENNEDY.

25:48.875 --> 25:51.750
AND IT SEEMS TO ME
THAT THE ONLY WAY
THAT THEY CAN HAVE PEACE

25:51.750 --> 25:54.375
IS TO CONFRONT THE ISSUE
THAT MISS KENNEDY
FINDS YOUR SON

25:54.375 --> 25:55.917
TO BE COMPLETELY
AND TOTALLY WITHOUT
TALENT OR ABILITY

25:55.917 --> 25:57.333
IN ANY WAY, SHAPE,
OR FORM.

25:57.333 --> 25:59.333
NO, NO, NO.
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

25:59.333 --> 26:00.667
WELL, WHAT WAS IT
THAT YOU DID SAY?

26:00.667 --> 26:02.000
YEAH, WHAT EXACTLY
DID YOU SAY?

26:05.041 --> 26:07.917
LOOK, I BELIEVE THAT
THE KEY TO SUCCESS

26:07.917 --> 26:09.834
IS NOT ONLY
HAVING A DREAM,

26:09.834 --> 26:11.125
BUT HAVING
THE RIGHT DREAM.

26:11.125 --> 26:12.333
THERE ARE PLENTY
OF PEOPLE

26:12.333 --> 26:13.834
WHO ASPIRE TO BE
WRITERS AND DIRECTORS,

26:13.834 --> 26:16.000

HAVE THE POTENTIAL.

31:11.792 --> 31:13.458

IT WAS JUST LIKE THIS.

35:15.083 --> 35:17.708
A FEW MINOR EPISODES
HERE AND THERE,

35:17.708 --> 35:20.417

CLINICAL EXPLANATION.

THEY SAID THAT SHE HAD
REPRESSED HER GRIEF
OF MY BROTHER'S DEATH

35:35.750 --> 35:39.458
TO THE POINT WHERE SHE
COULDN'T EXPERIENCE IT
WITH ANYONE

35:39.458 --> 35:41.375
SO SHE HAD TO,

35:41.375 --> 35:44.291

HAD TO CREATE SOMEONE
TO EXPERIENCE IT WITH.
