Hey, ah, yo.
Let me take that.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.680
That's OK I got 'em.

00:34.680 --> 00:36.920
Babe, they're way
too heavy for you.

00:36.920 --> 00:37.920
They're not.

00:37.920 --> 00:38.920
They are!

00:38.920 --> 00:40.360
They're not!

00:40.360 --> 00:43.280
Will you stop trying to
be such a guy all the time?

00:43.280 --> 00:45.600
You're right.

Hey, what's that,
a book?

01:05.760 --> 01:07.160
What was
your first clue?

01:07.160 --> 01:09.640
Give me a break.
Let me see.

01:09.640 --> 01:11.160
Sorry. Hands off.

01:11.160 --> 01:13.680
Is that book
part of your story?

01:13.680 --> 01:15.760
Sorta. My story's
about stories.

01:15.760 --> 01:17.680
Say what?

01:18.720 --> 01:21.160
We tell all kinds of
horror stories

01:21.160 --> 01:23.680
about demons and ghosts
and stuff.

01:23.680 --> 01:26.160
But no matter
what a story's about,

01:26.160 --> 01:30.120
there's only one thing
that makes it really scary.

01:30.120 --> 01:31.560
What's that?

01:31.560 --> 01:33.600
Your imagination.

01:33.600 --> 01:34.680
Huh?

01:36.760 --> 01:38.680
If you're really
into a story,

01:38.680 --> 01:40.200
you become part of it,

01:40.200 --> 01:42.200
and you start to imagine

01:42.200 --> 01:45.200
what horrible thing might be
sneaking around the corner,

01:45.200 --> 01:47.480
ready to pounce...

01:47.480 --> 01:49.480
And you start to wonder

01:49.480 --> 01:53.200
what you'd do if you were
the one facing

01:53.200 --> 01:55.360
the monster.

02:01.280 --> 02:04.160
It's your imagination
that gets you into a story,

02:04.160 --> 02:06.640
and unless
you're very careful,

02:06.640 --> 02:10.280
you might need your imagination
to get you out.

You working tonight?

03:33.680 --> 03:35.160
I told you.

03:35.160 --> 03:38.160
Got a young couple interested
in the Talbot place.

03:38.160 --> 03:41.160
I think they're gonna
make an offer this evening.

03:41.160 --> 03:42.160
[Doorbell rings]

03:42.160 --> 03:43.680
That must be
the sitter.

03:43.680 --> 03:45.800
A baby-sitter?

03:45.800 --> 03:47.200
Mom, I'm 12 years old.

03:47.200 --> 03:50.200
Exactly. Now, this girl
comes highly recommended.

03:50.200 --> 03:52.200
Please don't be
too hard on her,

03:52.200 --> 03:53.680

Uh...

04:14.640 --> 04:16.720
No, no. Um...

04:16.720 --> 04:19.720
I just wasn't expecting
someone so, um...

04:19.720 --> 04:20.720
So, um...

04:20.720 --> 04:22.160
So what?

04:22.160 --> 04:23.640
[Laughs]

04:23.640 --> 04:25.240
So what is
your secret?

04:25.240 --> 04:28.640
Every parent I've talked
to just raves about you.

04:28.640 --> 04:29.640
It's simple.

Oh, um...

04:39.320 --> 04:40.760
If there's any chance

04:40.760 --> 04:43.160
you could get him to
turn off the television--

Don't worry!

04:44.680 --> 04:47.680

12:40.040 --> 12:42.040
You have to
finish them.

12:42.040 --> 12:44.000
But, since you
burned my books...

12:44.000 --> 12:46.400
Let me in!
Ha ha ha!

12:49.280 --> 12:52.240
You're gonna have to
use your imagination

12:52.240 --> 12:55.280
if you don't wanna
end up being her dinner.

12:55.280 --> 12:56.640
What do I do?

12:56.640 --> 12:59.480
I'd finish off
the story--fast.

12:59.480 --> 13:00.560
But the book's gone.

13:00.560 --> 13:02.560
Well, then,
make it up.

13:02.560 --> 13:04.080
Make it up?

13:04.080 --> 13:05.560
Sure. Go for it.

13:05.560 --> 13:06.920
It's your story now.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.760
OK, OK!

13:08.760 --> 13:10.760
Ha ha ha ha ha!

13:10.760 --> 13:12.760
Hmm. Weird stuff
happened...

13:12.760 --> 13:14.760
Then it went away,

13:14.760 --> 13:17.760
and they lived happily
ever after. The end.

13:17.760 --> 13:18.760
[Ghost moans]

13:18.760 --> 13:20.760
It didn't work!

13:20.760 --> 13:22.200
Sorry.
[Makes buzzer sound]

13:22.200 --> 13:23.680
That is cheating.

13:23.680 --> 13:26.240
You're gonna hafta
do better than that.

13:26.240 --> 13:27.680
Cheating?
How can I cheat?

13:27.680 --> 13:30.920
I don't even know
what I'm doing.

13:30.920 --> 13:32.280
Uh-oh!

13:32.280 --> 13:34.280
<i>I hate when this
happens.</i>

13:34.280 --> 13:35.760
When what happens?

13:35.760 --> 13:38.760
How did you know
that was gonna happen?

13:38.760 --> 13:41.760
You have gotten 2
stories all mixed up.

13:41.760 --> 13:43.760
It really makes
things tough.

13:43.760 --> 13:45.800
[Witch] Ha ha ha ha!

13:45.800 --> 13:47.320
Wah ha ha ha!

13:47.320 --> 13:49.000
Run!

13:56.800 --> 13:59.240
[Ricky] Hey, I
can't see anything.

13:59.240 --> 14:01.280
It's right above
your head.

14:04.280 --> 14:06.240
This is getting fun.

14:06.240 --> 14:08.240
Now what happens?

14:08.240 --> 14:09.920
How should I know?

14:09.920 --> 14:13.240
'Cause it's your story,
silly.

14:13.240 --> 14:15.240
What happens?

14:15.240 --> 14:16.760
OK, OK!

14:16.760 --> 14:19.120
How about this?

14:19.120 --> 14:21.200
They ran down
to the basement

14:21.200 --> 14:23.200
where he kept
his uzi.

14:23.200 --> 14:25.120
Yeah, his uzi!

14:25.120 --> 14:26.720
In case of attacks

14:26.720 --> 14:29.640
by knights, ghosts,
and other nasty things.

14:33.200 --> 14:35.200
'Fraid not.

14:35.200 --> 14:36.440
Why not?

14:36.440 --> 14:39.200
What's wrong with that?
It's a good ending.

14:39.200 --> 14:41.720
Yeah, maybe for some
silly TV show,

14:41.720 --> 14:44.000
but it doesn't
make sense in this story.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.040
The ending's
in that book, isn't it?

14:46.040 --> 14:47.960
No. There's...

14:47.960 --> 14:49.920
Nothing in this one.

14:49.920 --> 14:52.920
So why are you
dragging it around?

14:52.920 --> 14:54.920
Why do you keep
peeking at it

14:54.920 --> 14:57.000
when you don't think
I'm lookin'?

14:57.000 --> 14:58.440
Give it to me!

15:00.800 --> 15:03.440
You really think
you're ready for this?

15:03.440 --> 15:04.840
Yes. Let me have it.

15:06.280 --> 15:07.720
OK. Ha ha ha!

15:07.720 --> 15:09.360
Have fun.

15:16.320 --> 15:18.080
I don't get it.

15:18.080 --> 15:20.600
What's the big deal?

15:21.760 --> 15:22.960
Uh-oh.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.240
"I don't get it.

15:27.240 --> 15:29.680
What's the big deal?"
He said.

15:29.680 --> 15:32.320
Then Ricky's voice
trailed off.

15:33.840 --> 15:36.200
I just said that.

15:36.200 --> 15:38.560
Ricky--that's me!

15:38.560 --> 15:41.080
"He stared blankly
for several seconds,

15:41.080 --> 15:42.960
unable to believe
his eyes."

15:44.360 --> 15:47.600
"For he was no longer in the
comfortable suburban house,

15:47.600 --> 15:51.120
but in the dank crypt
of an ancient castle."

15:52.640 --> 15:55.000
The dank crypt
of an ancient castle?

15:57.600 --> 16:01.000
"The walls ascended
into the darkness above,

16:01.000 --> 16:03.200
unscalable."

16:07.800 --> 16:11.240
I guess that means
forget about climbing them.

16:11.240 --> 16:14.720
"He wondered how the workmen
who had constructed this tomb

16:14.720 --> 16:16.480
had escaped."

16:16.480 --> 16:18.160
[Crunch]

16:19.480 --> 16:21.520
Oh, gross!

16:23.720 --> 16:25.280
"For hundreds of years,

16:25.280 --> 16:29.680
"no human footsteps had sounded
in the dreadful tomb,

16:29.680 --> 16:33.240
no living soul
had drawn a breath of air."

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
[Clanking]

16:45.080 --> 16:46.400
Oh, man!

16:49.480 --> 16:50.520
The book!

16:53.200 --> 16:54.800
Aah!

16:59.760 --> 17:01.120
Ugh!

17:04.280 --> 17:07.319
"Sworn to protect the sacred
tomb of his beloved king,

17:07.319 --> 17:10.760
the knight is waiting
through the ages for a sign."

17:10.760 --> 17:12.480
Aah!

17:14.720 --> 17:15.720
The sign!

17:15.720 --> 17:17.839
What's the sign?!

17:19.440 --> 17:20.560
The sign!

17:42.200 --> 17:43.200
Wow!

17:43.200 --> 17:45.120
Cool!

17:57.280 --> 17:59.200
"For all,
whether of ghostly form

17:59.200 --> 18:01.200
"or of flesh and bone,

18:01.200 --> 18:04.200
"who grasp the sword

18:04.200 --> 18:06.200
"would become its bearer

18:06.200 --> 18:08.720
to defend to the death"?

18:08.720 --> 18:11.720
I don't wanna defend
anything to the death!

18:11.720 --> 18:13.600
[Girl] Hey, mister.

18:19.560 --> 18:21.000
Please help me, mister.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.800
I'm lost.

18:23.840 --> 18:26.720
"He wondered
how she had come to be

18:26.720 --> 18:28.240
in these ancient ruins."

18:28.240 --> 18:31.240
Can'tcha put down
that book and help me?

18:31.240 --> 18:34.720
I don't know how
to find my way home.

18:34.720 --> 18:37.720
Hey, look, if I knew
how to get outta here,

18:37.720 --> 18:40.240
I'd tell ya.

18:41.800 --> 18:43.760
"She seemed out of place,

18:43.760 --> 18:46.240
as if from another time."

18:46.240 --> 18:47.760
Out of place.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.760
As if from
another time.

18:53.080 --> 18:55.680
Or another story!

18:55.680 --> 18:58.600
You're not a little girl!
You're the--

18:58.600 --> 19:00.120
Put down the book!

19:00.120 --> 19:02.080
Get away from me!

19:02.080 --> 19:04.400
Ha ha ha ha ha!

19:05.800 --> 19:09.560
Ah ha ha ha ha!

19:09.560 --> 19:10.560
Aah!

19:12.640 --> 19:13.960
Aah!

19:18.960 --> 19:20.680
Aah!

19:31.040 --> 19:33.200
[Rumbling]

19:49.320 --> 19:50.960
"In his heart,

19:50.960 --> 19:53.040
he knew the answer."

19:55.640 --> 19:58.240
What do I know
in my heart?

19:58.240 --> 20:00.240
OK. OK.

20:00.240 --> 20:03.240
Some sort of witch
or something.

20:03.240 --> 20:06.240
A knight defending
a tomb.

20:06.240 --> 20:09.320
Then that ghost!

20:09.320 --> 20:11.120
The ghost!

20:17.400 --> 20:20.280
"The destruction
of the evil sorceress

20:20.280 --> 20:23.200
freed the ancient king
from her spell."

20:28.120 --> 20:29.880
All right!

20:31.280 --> 20:35.240
"And he was no longer doomed
to wander the earth."

20:35.240 --> 20:36.880
Yes!

20:39.080 --> 20:42.280
<i>[Belinda] "The brave lad
stood, heart pounding,</i>

20:42.280 --> 20:45.360

golden rays...</i>

20:45.360 --> 20:50.240

"In a final act of homage,

"he knelt to return
the enchanted sword

to its rightful bearer,
the ancient king."

21:08.320 --> 21:10.200
What happened?

21:10.200 --> 21:12.040
The story's almost
over.

21:20.840 --> 21:25.200
"Never again would he place
limits on his own imagination,

21:25.200 --> 21:28.720
"no matter what terrors it
was capable of conjuring,

"for he knew that he
could no longer live

"in a world of
willful ignorance.

21:34.200 --> 21:35.720
The end."

21:35.720 --> 21:38.120
I don't believe it.

21:38.120 --> 21:40.200
W-we were just

21:40.200 --> 21:41.840
reading.

21:43.280 --> 21:44.720
Yes. That's, uh,

21:44.720 --> 21:47.240
that's the part
I don't believe.

21:47.240 --> 21:48.720
Well, I...

21:48.720 --> 21:50.880
guess I'd better
be on my way.

21:53.320 --> 21:55.720
Look, Ricky. This
author has your name.

21:55.720 --> 21:58.800
<i> "The Dark Tomb,
by Ricky Winter."</i>

21:58.800 --> 22:00.960
Did it really happen?

22:03.800 --> 22:05.760
It's just a story,
Ricky.

22:05.760 --> 22:07.520
You know that.

22:08.840 --> 22:11.800
Oh, Belinda.
How much do I owe you?

22:11.800 --> 22:15.120
I've already
been paid, Mrs. Winter.

22:16.360 --> 22:17.760
Good night!

22:17.760 --> 22:19.640
Call me anytime.

22:21.280 --> 22:23.440
What an odd girl.

22:27.280 --> 22:29.720
<i> Ricky searched
all over the library,</i>

22:29.720 --> 22:32.720
<i> but he never found
another copy of the Dark Tomb</i>

22:32.720 --> 22:34.240
<i> by Ricky Winter</i>

22:34.240 --> 22:37.280
<i> or any other of the books
that Belinda brought over...</i>

22:41.800 --> 22:46.200
'Cause they were all
first and only editions.

22:46.200 --> 22:47.960
The end.

22:49.440 --> 22:51.080
Good one, bet.

22:51.080 --> 22:54.720
I declare this meeting
of the Midnight Society

22:54.720 --> 22:56.720
closed.

22:56.720 --> 22:58.200
Hey!

22:58.200 --> 23:00.080
Hold on!

23:00.080 --> 23:02.720
I still wanna see
what you've got there.

23:02.720 --> 23:05.240
No. You're way too
young for this one.

23:05.240 --> 23:06.320
Oh, yeah?

23:08.800 --> 23:11.840
"The book that the beautiful and
intelligent Betty Ann held in her hand

Hey! How'd you--

23:17.600 --> 23:19.480
Gotcha.

23:19.480 --> 23:21.920
Man, are you predictable
or what?

23:21.920 --> 23:23.680
She set me up.

23:23.680 --> 23:26.680
I don't believe it!
She set me up!

always another night.
