00:05.200 --> 00:07.960
Guys, look what I got
for Big Rhonda.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.440
Oh, it's so nice to have
a girlfriend on Valentine's Day.

00:11.520 --> 00:15.680
Yeah, it definitely increases the chance
of gettin' your fun stuff touched.

00:16.800 --> 00:19.360
Well, sorry, fun stuff.

00:20.680 --> 00:23.000
Looks like it's just
you and me this year.

00:25.720 --> 00:28.000
Unless...

00:28.080 --> 00:30.040
- Sorry, fun stuff.
- Yeah.

00:31.320 --> 00:33.400
Oh, Rhonda's
going to love these.

00:33.480 --> 00:36.320
I just have to not eat them
until Valentine's Day.

00:36.400 --> 00:40.160
- But you love candy.
- Some would say it's an unnatural love.

00:40.240 --> 00:44.200
Yes, I do love candy.
But I love Rhonda more.

00:44.280 --> 00:47.000
Really? 'Cause there's
three pieces missing.

00:48.320 --> 00:50.360
Fine. I love her the same.

00:51.640 --> 00:53.720
Hi, sweetie.
How was work?

00:53.760 --> 00:56.120
I am so exhausted.

00:56.160 --> 00:59.040
Yeah, the commute from Austria
must be a real bitch.

01:00.440 --> 01:03.200
A bus full of old people
stopped by the Cheese Palace.

01:03.280 --> 01:07.880
And when they saw free samples,
all hell broke loose.

01:09.600 --> 01:12.440
But the good news is
I got paid!

01:12.520 --> 01:14.400
Oh, that's great.

01:14.440 --> 01:17.280
'Cause Valentine's Day's coming up,
and I need you to give me money...

01:17.320 --> 01:21.240
and tell me whatever foo-foo
crap gift you want to get.

01:21.280 --> 01:23.760
Michael, I'm not doing that again.

01:23.840 --> 01:28.160
Last year I gave you money,
and you bought a bag of plastic dinosaurs.

01:29.760 --> 01:32.160
For you!

01:32.200 --> 01:36.120
Look, you need to make some cash...

01:36.200 --> 01:38.240
and buy me something nice...

01:38.320 --> 01:42.160
because I worked way too hard
for my money, and you're not gettin' any.

01:42.240 --> 01:44.080
Oh, I smell like hickory.

01:45.680 --> 01:47.720
Oh, this bites.

01:47.800 --> 01:51.040
Hey, Fez, how's it going
with not eating the candy?

01:51.120 --> 01:53.080
Fine, thank you.

02:31.440 --> 02:34.360
Oh, my God.
Casey Kelso's here.

02:34.440 --> 02:38.560
What? Oh, my God.
He is so fine.

02:40.280 --> 02:43.120
You know, if you marry Casey
and I marry Michael...

02:43.160 --> 02:45.040
we'll be like sisters.

02:45.080 --> 02:48.200
Yea!
Okay, go talk to him.

02:48.240 --> 02:52.680
- I don't know.
- I want to go baby shopping with you. Now go!

02:52.760 --> 02:54.760
All right. Shut up.

03:04.560 --> 03:07.440
Oh, my God. Casey.

03:09.080 --> 03:12.040
Hey, Pinciotti.
How you been?

03:12.080 --> 03:13.960
Love the jeans.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.560
Really? They're blue.

03:17.640 --> 03:20.400
Um...

03:20.480 --> 03:23.640
so what have you, like,
you know, been up to?

03:23.720 --> 03:26.920
I'm working part-time
for the railroad.

03:26.960 --> 03:29.560
They leave a lot of stuff unlocked.

03:29.640 --> 03:32.800
You need any Cheerios or rebar?

03:32.880 --> 03:35.440
- No, I'm good. Thanks.
- Right on.

03:35.520 --> 03:39.280
Well, listen, I'll give you a call sometime,
but right now I gotta go see a guy.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.600
He's got a leather
steering-wheel cover.

03:41.680 --> 03:43.840
Oh, yeah.
For the Trans Am.

03:43.920 --> 03:47.720
Yeah. I was thinkin' about using
my G.I. Bill for college...

03:47.760 --> 03:50.840
but, uh, Trans Ams
just kick so much ass.

03:50.920 --> 03:53.760
I love the Trans Am!

03:53.840 --> 03:55.720
Everybody does.

03:55.800 --> 03:58.280
- See ya.
- Okay, bye.

04:00.440 --> 04:03.920
- He's gonna call me.
- You gave him your number?

04:04.000 --> 04:06.720
Of course I... didn't.
Damn it!

04:06.800 --> 04:10.640
Oh, that's okay.
Kelsos never call.

04:10.720 --> 04:12.600
They're like dogs.

04:12.680 --> 04:15.760
They're cute,
but they can't work a phone.

04:15.840 --> 04:20.640
Hey, Jackie. I thought
about what you said...

04:20.720 --> 04:24.280
about making money so I can get you
a Valentine's Day gift, right?

04:24.360 --> 04:27.120
And then I realized
that it'd mean a lot more...

04:27.200 --> 04:31.560
if I gave you something that
I crafted with my own two loving hands.

04:37.680 --> 04:40.240
Oh, my God! It's horrible!

04:40.320 --> 04:43.080
No, it's an address rock.

04:43.120 --> 04:45.400
You put it on your lawn.

04:45.480 --> 04:47.600
Happy Valentine's Day,
my love.

04:49.240 --> 04:52.120
Michael, a rock
is not a romantic gift.

04:52.200 --> 04:54.600
And that's not even my address.

04:57.440 --> 04:59.520
That's my address.

05:00.640 --> 05:02.480
No, it isn't.

05:02.560 --> 05:05.120
That's my dad's address rock!

05:05.200 --> 05:07.240
No, it isn't!

05:12.400 --> 05:14.320
Hey, Dad.
You want this?

05:14.360 --> 05:16.440
Thanks, Son.
I love you.

05:24.360 --> 05:26.640
I'm sorry. What?

05:27.720 --> 05:30.600
I love you. I really do.

05:35.840 --> 05:39.880
Yeah.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.640
Yeah.

05:49.480 --> 05:52.120
Donna!

05:52.200 --> 05:55.040
What are you doing at my house?

05:55.120 --> 06:00.480
Nothing. I just thought I'd come by
and see what you were up to.

06:01.800 --> 06:04.560
Oh, you're here
to see Casey, aren't you?

06:04.640 --> 06:07.920
Casey, your lover's here!

06:07.960 --> 06:11.600
You love my brother!
You're gonna do it with...

06:11.680 --> 06:14.480
Ow! Mom!

06:14.520 --> 06:16.440
- Thank you.
- No problem.

06:16.520 --> 06:18.360
<i>Spaz face!</i>

06:18.440 --> 06:20.280
- Hey, there.
- Hey.

06:20.360 --> 06:24.960
Um, you were gonna call me, and I remember
I never, like, gave you my number.

06:25.040 --> 06:27.760
So, anyway, here's my number.

06:27.800 --> 06:31.600
You know, I was gonna get that from you
tomorrow night... when we go out.

06:31.680 --> 06:36.000
- We're going out?
- Yeah. I'll pick you up at The Hub after school.

06:36.080 --> 06:37.920
I'll be in the Trans Am.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.760
I love the Trans Am!

06:40.840 --> 06:43.720
Everybody does.

06:43.800 --> 06:46.240
Later, Pinciotti.

06:50.240 --> 06:52.160
Pinciotti.

06:59.440 --> 07:04.040
Mom, was Dad abducted by aliens and replaced
by an identical creature programmed to love?

07:07.360 --> 07:11.280
Honey, this is breakfast.
Don't ask me things.

07:14.240 --> 07:16.800
He told me he loved me.

07:23.120 --> 07:26.280
Your father?

07:26.320 --> 07:28.360
No!

07:28.400 --> 07:30.720
Yeah.

07:30.800 --> 07:34.080
I think I know what happened.

07:34.160 --> 07:36.880
I gave your father
an early Valentine's Day card...

07:36.960 --> 07:39.360
that said what a wonderful
husband and father he is...

07:39.440 --> 07:42.240
and it rhymed,
and maybe it touched him.

07:43.840 --> 07:47.280
It didn't look like it touched him.
He just... He got up and got a beer.

07:47.360 --> 07:50.840
But maybe deep down...

07:50.920 --> 07:54.760
deep, deep, deep down...

07:54.800 --> 07:56.840
something woke up.

07:56.920 --> 07:59.320
I am so glad he loves you.

08:01.360 --> 08:03.680
Yeah, but, Mom, this is weird.

08:03.760 --> 08:06.120
He's never said that. Ever.

08:06.160 --> 08:08.920
One time I saved him
from getting hit by a lumber truck...

08:09.000 --> 08:12.440
and I think he was about to say it,
but then he said...

08:12.520 --> 08:15.280
"Get in the car."

08:20.920 --> 08:24.240
But how am I
supposed to handle this?

08:24.280 --> 08:26.160
You think I should say it back?

08:30.560 --> 08:32.600
He's gonna hit me.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.520
Maybe not.

08:42.320 --> 08:45.240
I can't believe that Jackie
wants me to get a job.

08:45.320 --> 08:49.280
I mean, my plan has always been
to coast through life on my good looks.

08:49.360 --> 08:52.880
I mean, look at me!
It's like I was chiseled out of marble.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.960
Okay, you guys, here goes.

08:57.040 --> 09:00.840
Dad, I love you.

09:02.480 --> 09:05.840
I love <i>you,</i> Pop.

09:06.840 --> 09:10.240
Poppy? Pappy? Daddy? No.

09:13.840 --> 09:17.320
Oh, I have to... I have to stop eating
Rhonda's chocolates.

09:18.760 --> 09:20.640
Oh, it's hopeless.

09:24.480 --> 09:28.960
Kelso, if you need to make
some quick cash, just sell your blood.

09:29.040 --> 09:32.680
And you!
You've had enough of this!

09:32.720 --> 09:35.440
No, I can stop anytime I want.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.880
I am not selling blood.

09:39.920 --> 09:44.200
There's no way that anything inside
of my body is comin' out for cash.

09:44.240 --> 09:47.520
Well, that's too bad, Kelso, 'cause
I hear there's this clinic in Madison...

09:47.600 --> 09:51.880
that'll pay you for your,
um, manly donations.

09:53.520 --> 09:56.160
Manly donations?

09:56.240 --> 09:59.480
No way!
They'll pay you for that?

09:59.560 --> 10:01.840
Well, I'll do that.
I'm good at that.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.560
"Do you have any serious
medical conditions?"

10:14.480 --> 10:17.280
Puked... after...

10:17.360 --> 10:21.800
Crunch Berry eating contest.

10:21.840 --> 10:25.920
- You know what? I'll just finish that for you.
- Thank you.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.480
Now, Mr. <i>Chang...</i>

10:30.920 --> 10:32.880
you'll be in room two.

10:32.960 --> 10:35.760
Some of our clients prefer a magazine.
Would you like one?

10:35.800 --> 10:39.120
Nah. Farrah was on Carson last night.
I should be good to go.

10:41.920 --> 10:46.600
Okay, so I was in the kitchen and Red came
in, and I was gonna tell him I loved him.

10:46.640 --> 10:49.320
But, uh, then he said
if my hair got any longer...

10:49.360 --> 10:52.840
he was gonna buy me
a pair of boobs, so...

10:56.720 --> 10:58.920
Yeah, you're in a tough spot.

10:58.960 --> 11:03.760
But just know I'm here for you,
'cause... I love you.

11:06.160 --> 11:09.160
You know what would make Forman
feel better? A piece of that candy.

11:09.240 --> 11:12.200
No, no, no. There's only nine left.
I will guard them with my life.

11:12.280 --> 11:14.880
Hyde! Eric!

11:14.960 --> 11:16.800
Fez!

11:20.640 --> 11:23.200
Easiest money I ever made.

11:23.280 --> 11:26.800
They paid me 50 bucks
for my underpants navy.

11:33.800 --> 11:37.400
You mean
your corduroy commandos?

11:37.480 --> 11:40.200
Yeah, your team from the inseam?

11:42.280 --> 11:45.920
Your <i>Battle-pants Galactica?</i>

11:46.000 --> 11:49.760
- <i>Battle-pants Galactica.</i> Nice one. Wow.
- It just came to me. Thank you.

11:49.840 --> 11:52.120
Man, this job is the greatest.

11:52.200 --> 11:54.520
It combines all my interests,
hobbies and skills...

11:54.600 --> 11:57.240
into one moneymaking endeavor.

11:57.320 --> 12:01.040
I'm gonna get Jackie
a sweet gift. Popcorn?

12:01.120 --> 12:03.360
- Dude!
- Oh, forget it!

12:12.280 --> 12:15.240
All right, Kelso.
Where the hell is your moron brother?

12:15.280 --> 12:18.760
He was supposed to meet me at The Hub,
and he totally blew me off.

12:18.800 --> 12:21.280
Whoa. A Kelso blew you off?

12:22.920 --> 12:25.040
Oh, my God. What a shock.

12:25.120 --> 12:28.400
Oh, hey, Colonel Mustard called.
He said get a clue.

12:33.480 --> 12:35.720
What is wrong with you Kelsos?

12:35.800 --> 12:38.960
Did all of you
get dropped on your heads?

12:39.040 --> 12:41.800
You know, if you're mad at Casey,
why don't you go yell at him?

12:41.840 --> 12:44.560
I'm too tired from working
all day to argue.

12:51.520 --> 12:54.120
Oh, to be a working stiff.

13:00.560 --> 13:05.640
So, Red, you big, old softy.

13:08.640 --> 13:11.760
Did anything special
happen yesterday?

13:11.840 --> 13:15.240
Special?
Well, let's see.

13:15.280 --> 13:18.160
The dentist called with a cancellation,
so I went in...

13:18.240 --> 13:21.920
and the sadistic son of a bitch
found a cavity.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.400
The next thing I know,
I'm hopped up on drugs...

13:24.480 --> 13:26.640
and he's taking
a jackhammer to my jaw.

13:26.720 --> 13:29.520
I spent the rest of the day in a fog.

13:31.080 --> 13:33.160
Oh, no.

13:33.200 --> 13:36.360
Oh, my God. You don't remember
what you said to Eric?

13:36.400 --> 13:39.920
Kitty, I don't even remember
how I got home.

13:41.200 --> 13:43.120
All right, Dad.

13:43.160 --> 13:45.280
Look, I tried to figure out
the right words...

13:45.360 --> 13:47.400
and then I realized
I just gotta say it, so...

13:47.480 --> 13:50.240
- Wait, Eric...
- Mom, please.

13:51.480 --> 13:53.360
Dad, I...

13:53.400 --> 13:57.600
Stop!

14:01.600 --> 14:07.040
He was drugged!

14:07.120 --> 14:10.640
Love you.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.800
Go to your room.

14:47.960 --> 14:51.240
Rhonda is going to be
so disappointed.

14:51.280 --> 14:55.160
All that remains
is one lonely candy.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.320
Look!

15:01.920 --> 15:04.160
More candies!

15:04.240 --> 15:07.080
It's a Valentine's Day miracle!

15:09.600 --> 15:12.440
Oh, candy...

15:12.520 --> 15:14.560
you've got me under your spell!

15:15.840 --> 15:19.840
Jackie, I couldn't wait
till Valentine's Day.

15:19.920 --> 15:22.000
So... here.

15:24.280 --> 15:29.400
Oh, my God, Michael!
These earrings are gorgeous!

15:29.480 --> 15:31.560
Big day at the office?

15:37.280 --> 15:39.400
Yeah, I worked a double shift.

15:42.640 --> 15:45.920
Wai-Wait. You got a job?

15:46.000 --> 15:49.760
Michael, I am so proud of you.

15:49.840 --> 15:52.800
Well, now, if it wasn't
for you pushing me...

15:52.880 --> 15:55.000
I would've never realized
how good it feels...

15:55.080 --> 15:58.200
to roll up my sleeves,
get a little sweaty and earn some cash.

15:58.280 --> 16:01.840
Oh, this is so exciting!

16:01.920 --> 16:04.560
I can't wait to come
visit you at work.

16:06.320 --> 16:08.480
That'll speed things up.

16:09.800 --> 16:12.240
What's he talking about?

16:12.320 --> 16:14.680
Oh.

16:14.760 --> 16:17.960
I've been selling my love nectar.

16:20.560 --> 16:23.240
What?

16:23.320 --> 16:26.280
Michael, you can't do that.
You're hot.

16:26.320 --> 16:29.360
Women are gonna want to take
your little Kelsos home.

16:30.960 --> 16:33.760
My God, she's right.

16:33.840 --> 16:37.320
Think about it...
a world full of Kelsos.

16:39.120 --> 16:42.720
Libraries will fall into disrepair.

16:42.800 --> 16:46.320
There'll be feathered hair
as far as the eye can see.

16:46.400 --> 16:50.560
We'll have to put padding
on every sharp corner!

16:50.640 --> 16:55.360
Hey, those sharp corners
can be hazardous, man.

16:55.440 --> 16:59.280
I mean, come on. It's 1978!
Things should be round by now!

17:02.960 --> 17:07.800
Hey! Hey, Casey!

17:07.880 --> 17:09.720
Hey, Pinciotti.

17:09.800 --> 17:14.240
What the hell happened to you?
I was waiting at The Hub?

17:14.319 --> 17:17.119
Oh, man.

17:17.200 --> 17:21.040
See, the thing is, when I went
to go pick up the steering-wheel cover...

17:21.119 --> 17:25.359
the Trans Am was running kind of rough,
so I thought I'd rebuild the carburetor.

17:25.440 --> 17:28.840
<i>But I was waiting at The Hub.</i>

17:28.920 --> 17:33.520
Well, you want a smooth ride,
don't you?

17:33.600 --> 17:37.800
I just think that if you say
you're gonna be someplace...

17:37.840 --> 17:39.720
that you should be there.

17:40.880 --> 17:43.080
Aw, man, I guess I flaked.

17:43.160 --> 17:48.240
I've just got this thing
where a lot of times I don't show up.

17:48.320 --> 17:50.880
I don't know what to do about it.

17:50.960 --> 17:53.320
How about showing up?

17:53.400 --> 17:56.760
I guess I could give that a shot.

17:58.280 --> 18:00.440
So this will never happen again?

18:00.520 --> 18:02.800
No, I'm pretty sure it'll happen again.

18:02.880 --> 18:06.280
But we'll light that firecracker
when we come to it.

18:08.080 --> 18:10.280
Fair enough.

18:15.600 --> 18:18.680
I can't believe this.
When I got here, I was so mad at you...

18:18.760 --> 18:20.840
and I already totally forgave you.

18:20.920 --> 18:23.160
Yeah. Everybody does.

18:26.760 --> 18:30.600
I'm sorry, miss,
but I can't give it to you.

18:30.680 --> 18:34.680
The donor himself is the only one
who has legal rights over the specimen.

18:34.760 --> 18:37.000
Fine!

18:37.080 --> 18:40.040
Michael, you get them!

18:40.120 --> 18:44.400
You're the only one who has
rights over your "special men."

18:46.720 --> 18:50.800
Jackie, what do you care
what I do with my special men?

18:50.880 --> 18:55.680
Specimen.
I said, specimen.

18:55.760 --> 18:59.440
I care because if there are
gonna be any little Kelso babies...

18:59.520 --> 19:01.400
well, I want them to be ours.

19:01.480 --> 19:05.600
Oh. You want to have my children?

19:05.680 --> 19:08.040
Well, yeah.

19:08.080 --> 19:11.840
I mean, if you get rich and don't
lose your hair. Because I love you.

19:13.680 --> 19:15.720
I love you too.

19:18.320 --> 19:21.560
You can't do that here.

19:21.640 --> 19:25.320
Oh, she's right.
We'll be in room two.

19:32.920 --> 19:35.920
- Dad?
- Oh, crap.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.720
I was hoping that you
wouldn't find me back here.

19:38.800 --> 19:41.160
Well, that's a good icebreaker.

19:41.240 --> 19:43.600
Look, um...

19:43.640 --> 19:47.080
about the... "love" incident...

19:47.120 --> 19:50.840
All right.
Stop right there.

19:50.920 --> 19:55.400
There are only a few times in life when it's
acceptable for a man to use that phrase...

19:55.440 --> 19:58.920
when he's drunk,
when he's dying...

19:59.000 --> 20:02.920
or when he's in big trouble
and that's the only way out.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.840
Which usually means he's drunk.

20:05.920 --> 20:07.800
So, other than that...

20:07.880 --> 20:11.400
Other than that,
it's just a given.

20:13.720 --> 20:18.120
Oh. Hey, you just
kind of told me...

20:18.160 --> 20:21.040
No, I didn't.

20:21.080 --> 20:23.720
Yes, you did.

20:23.760 --> 20:26.400
Well, I'm drunk.

20:26.480 --> 20:29.200
Clearly I'm drunk.

20:29.280 --> 20:32.280
Daddy, be my valentine.

20:33.600 --> 20:36.240
Do I have to hit you?
Go to your room.

20:36.320 --> 20:38.240
All right.

20:41.360 --> 20:45.680
Good news. My boys
are back in friendly hands.

20:45.760 --> 20:49.480
Ironically, that's just where
they started their journey.

20:49.520 --> 20:53.760
That's a shame, Kelso. It's the one job
I knew you could've been a success at.

20:53.840 --> 20:55.400
Thanks, Hyde.

20:55.440 --> 20:58.720
Kelso, get that nasty bag
of genetics out of my basement.

20:58.800 --> 21:02.520
This bag?

21:02.600 --> 21:05.440
Burn! It's just
a big bag of candy.

21:05.520 --> 21:08.320
Candy? What kind of candy?

21:09.305 --> 21:15.320
