DRACULA: Ah, welcome to
Creepmas at my monster hotel.

00:40.007 --> 00:44.376
I'm your host, Dracula,
as I'm sure you can tell.

00:44.378 --> 00:47.079
But this holiday tale
is not about me.

00:47.081 --> 00:51.850
I'm stuck at vampire council,
missing Mavy-wavy.

00:51.852 --> 00:55.954
<i>And right now, it appears</i>
<i>a scary yarn's being spun</i>

00:55.956 --> 01:01.493

MAVIS: And he only comes
when you're dead asleep.

your street.

01:13.808 --> 01:16.408
(MAKING BRAKES SCREECHING SOUND)

01:16.410 --> 01:20.446
Then, just when things
couldn't possibly

01:20.448 --> 01:21.747
get any more terrifying,

01:21.749 --> 01:26.318
Krampus pulls out his cannon and
blasts presents under the tree!

01:28.021 --> 01:29.655
I love Creepmas!
Yeah!

01:29.657 --> 01:32.391
Dude,
Krampus is the perfect

01:32.393 --> 01:35.427
Creepmas monster.
Super scary,

01:35.429 --> 01:39.331
but he brings presents,
so he's super cool, too!

01:39.333 --> 01:41.533
You did great taking
over for your dad,

01:41.535 --> 01:44.670
telling the Krampus story
this year, Mavis.

01:44.672 --> 01:46.138
He'd be totally proud.

01:46.140 --> 01:48.941
Thanks, Wendy.
But without Dad here,

01:48.943 --> 01:50.876
Creepmas is sort
of bittersweet.

01:50.878 --> 01:54.213
Don't worry, Mavis.
We're gonna party so hardy,

01:54.215 --> 01:56.915
you won't even notice
Drac isn't here.
(CHUCKLES)

01:56.917 --> 01:58.550
Uh, about that...

01:58.552 --> 02:02.221
You know how Aunt Lydia
feels about decorations

02:02.223 --> 02:06.825
and Creepmas,
and pretty much
fun in general.

02:06.827 --> 02:08.160
Oh, come on.

02:08.162 --> 02:12.264
Fine. But we've got
to be inconspicuous.

02:12.266 --> 02:14.800
Low-key is my specialty.

02:14.802 --> 02:18.270
DRACULA:
<i>So, the gang set to work</i>
<i>on a Creepmas display,</i>

02:18.272 --> 02:22.341

was not Pedro's forte.

02:22.343 --> 02:23.041
(CRASHING)

02:23.043 --> 02:25.978
<i>And with only a handful</i>

02:25.980 --> 02:29.748
<i>Aunt Lydia arrived with</i>
<i>a scowl on her face.</i>

02:29.750 --> 02:31.917
What is the meaning of this?

02:31.919 --> 02:34.620
Aunt Lydia! Hi!
So glad you're here!

02:34.622 --> 02:37.589
We thought, since there's only
one night 'til Creepmas,

02:37.591 --> 02:40.659
it'd be cool to put up
just a few decorations?

02:40.661 --> 02:43.262
Bah humbug.

02:43.264 --> 02:44.830
(HUMMING)

(GASPING)

02:48.268 --> 02:50.602
But, Aunt Lydia, every year,

02:50.604 --> 02:52.437
Dad and I go crazy

02:52.439 --> 02:53.272
<i>decorating and</i>
<i>baking and...</i>

02:53.274 --> 02:59.745
AUNT LYDIA: <i>I realize</i>
<i>your father is something of</i>
<i>a Creepmas enthusiast.</i>

02:59.747 --> 03:01.413
But I am in charge
this year,

03:01.415 --> 03:06.618
and if I see even one more hint
of Creepmas in this hotel...

03:06.620 --> 03:08.187
Uh-oh!

03:08.189 --> 03:10.422
(SCREAMING)

03:13.026 --> 03:13.892

Aunt Lydia, no!
The missile toes!

03:16.763 --> 03:18.764
(GROWLING)

03:24.337 --> 03:29.508
That's it.
Creepmas is canceled!

03:29.510 --> 03:32.744
Um, Scary Creepmas?

DRACULA:
<i>And though she'd</i>
<i>seen it each year,</i>

03:35.849 --> 03:37.216
<i>now Mavis wanted a reason</i>

03:37.218 --> 03:42.454
to explain her Aunt's loathing
of the whole Creepmas season.

03:42.456 --> 03:47.159
What kind of monster thinks
she can just cancel Creepmas?

03:47.161 --> 03:48.060
This stinks!

03:48.062 --> 03:50.729
It's sad to see, really.
When she was little,

03:50.731 --> 03:53.398
Lydia used to love Creepmas
more than any monster.

03:53.400 --> 03:56.802
Yeah, that makes sense.
She used to... Wait, what?

03:56.804 --> 03:59.271
You're saying my Aunt Lydia,

03:59.273 --> 04:02.941
the Dark Baroness,
loved Creepmas?

Aw, come on!
I wasn't looking!

04:09.116 --> 04:11.650
(LAUGHING)
Exactly!

04:11.652 --> 04:13.885
Thanks for the early
Creepmas present, Mavis!

04:13.887 --> 04:16.154
Uncle Gene, are you serious?

04:16.156 --> 04:19.524
Sure, I'm serious!
Lydia was kooky for Creepmas!

04:19.526 --> 04:24.229
She worshipped Krampus!
Once, she even visited him!

04:24.231 --> 04:25.664
<i>Most monsters, of course,</i>

04:25.666 --> 04:28.033
<i>are too afraid</i>
<i>to actually meet Krampus,</i>

04:28.035 --> 04:29.067
<i>writing letters instead,</i>

04:29.069 --> 04:31.970
<i>so he knows what</i>
<i>to fire under the tree.</i>

04:31.972 --> 04:35.007
(LAUGHING)
<i>Only the most</i>
<i>die-hard Creepmas fans</i>

04:35.009 --> 04:38.477
dare make the long, dangerous
trip through the underworld

04:38.479 --> 04:39.978
<i>to deliver their wishes</i>
<i>in person,</i>

04:39.980 --> 04:42.814
<i>and then be bowled</i>
<i>down Krampus Mountain,</i>

04:42.816 --> 04:44.616
<i>as is tradition.</i>

04:46.953 --> 04:48.253
<i>When it was Lydia's turn,</i>

04:48.255 --> 04:50.289
<i>her terrifying trip</i>
<i>became worth it.</i>

04:50.291 --> 04:53.892
<i>The highlight of her young,</i>
<i>40-year-old afterlife</i>

04:53.894 --> 04:58.096
<i>was when she asked</i>
<i>or the only toy she'd</i>
<i>ever wanted...</i>

04:58.098 --> 04:59.031
<i>My First Mace.</i>

04:59.033 --> 05:04.303
<i>She even gave Krampus</i>
<i>a picture, so he wouldn't</i>
<i>get confused.</i>

05:04.437 --> 05:09.074
<i>But then, Lydia noticed</i>
<i>something was off.</i>

05:09.076 --> 05:11.943
<i>Instead of bowling her out</i>
<i>like the other kids,</i>

05:11.945 --> 05:16.648
<i>Krampus just smiled</i>
<i>and sent Lydia on her way.</i>

05:17.784 --> 05:20.452
<i>And so, that Creepmas night,</i>

05:20.454 --> 05:22.854
Lydia crept out of her coffin

05:22.856 --> 05:26.792
<i>to see what Krampus</i>
<i>had shot under the tree.</i>

05:26.794 --> 05:28.093
<i>Lydia found...</i>

05:28.095 --> 05:31.430
<i>A shiny jingle bell!</i>

05:31.432 --> 05:33.131
(LYDIA SOBBING)

05:34.067 --> 05:37.269
It was the first
and last Creepmas gift

05:37.271 --> 05:39.738
your Aunt ever asked for.

05:39.939 --> 05:43.241
That is the
saddest thing ever!

05:43.243 --> 05:45.877
No wonder she doesn't
like Creepmas!

05:45.879 --> 05:48.880
But it does give me an idea.

05:48.882 --> 05:50.816
You guys thinking
what I'm thinking?

05:50.818 --> 05:52.417
Uh, that we should be
thankful we're dead

05:52.419 --> 05:55.554
to enjoy Creepmas at all and not
meddle in Lydia's affairs?

05:55.556 --> 05:57.889
Exactly!
We gotta go see Krampus

05:57.891 --> 05:59.791
so we can tell him how
he totally blew it

05:59.793 --> 06:01.927
with Aunt Lydia's
only Creepmas wish

06:01.929 --> 06:04.696
and demand a My First Mace!

06:04.698 --> 06:08.567
Yeah, I'm afraid I'm out.
That is way above my pay grade.

06:08.569 --> 06:10.736
I'm out, too.
My folks just got here

06:10.738 --> 06:12.537
and they didn't pack
for a funeral.

06:12.539 --> 06:13.672
Well, I, for one, am in.

06:13.674 --> 06:17.509
Mavis is my best friend,
and if she needs help
saving Creepmas,

06:17.511 --> 06:18.677
then I'm there for her.

06:18.679 --> 06:20.746
Thank you, Wendy.

06:20.748 --> 06:23.315
Right.
And just out of curiosity,

06:23.317 --> 06:25.951
you are familiar with the part
of the Krampus legend

06:25.953 --> 06:27.853
concerning what happens
if you try to see him

06:27.855 --> 06:29.788
outside of official
visiting hours?

06:29.790 --> 06:31.690
MAVIS: Ha-ha! Hank!

06:31.692 --> 06:34.893
Come on! This is about
more than a toy!

06:34.895 --> 06:39.131
It's about songs and decorations
and roast serpent dinner!

06:39.133 --> 06:44.770
It's about saving Creepmas for
Aunt Lydia and the whole hotel!

06:44.772 --> 06:47.172
You know Fifi
the Zombie Clown?

06:47.174 --> 06:48.206
Before she visited Krampus,

06:48.208 --> 06:53.512
she was Fifi
the Perfectly Normal Paralegal.

I think I hear Daddy.

06:57.918 --> 07:01.319
Yep, he's yelling that
he wants to go goo-bogganing,

07:01.321 --> 07:03.588
so I better just bounce to it.

07:03.590 --> 07:06.291
But ya know,
I wish you luck, Mavis,

07:06.293 --> 07:07.359
and I think
you're gonna do great!

07:07.361 --> 07:10.195
Fine! I'll just go see
Krampus myself then!

but this is
a Creepmas emergency.

07:53.240 --> 07:56.942
(SIGHING ANGRILY)
It always is.

07:56.944 --> 07:57.609
Right, right. Sorry.

07:57.611 --> 08:01.813
I just... I just need to
ask about an oversight
made on a gift

08:01.815 --> 08:05.684
for my Aunt,
back in the late 800s?

08:05.686 --> 08:07.919
An oversight?
Listen...

08:07.921 --> 08:10.422
Um... Mavis, was it?

08:10.424 --> 08:13.058
I appreciate your
attention to detail.

08:13.060 --> 08:14.926
Oh, well, it's my pleasure.

08:14.928 --> 08:17.996
But Krampus
doesn't make mistakes!

08:17.998 --> 08:21.466
My Aunt is Lydia Dracula!
Lydia?

08:21.468 --> 08:24.603
Well, well, well...

08:24.605 --> 08:26.471
Why didn't you say so?

08:26.473 --> 08:31.409
I remember exactly the Creepmas
gift you're talking about.

08:31.411 --> 08:33.511
It was no mistake.

08:33.514 --> 08:36.147
<i>She was never supposed</i>
<i>to get that present.</i>

08:36.149 --> 08:40.585
And as far as I can tell,
everything worked out perfectly.

08:40.587 --> 08:41.820
But...

08:41.822 --> 08:42.153
No buts!

08:42.155 --> 08:45.757
I've gotta catch at least
a little shut-eye
before my trip,

08:45.759 --> 08:49.294
so I recommend you
fly back the way you came

08:49.296 --> 08:50.695
and forget about that mace.

08:50.697 --> 08:57.435
You know, unless you
wanna end up as fish food
in Lake Rashy Skin?

08:57.437 --> 08:59.137

No, I'm good!

give it to her.

by a cannon under
the Bone Tree,

it's from Krampus!

21:32.492 --> 21:34.825
But I just missed you too much.

21:34.827 --> 21:39.897
Unfortunately,
I didn't have a chance
to get you a Creepmas gift!

21:39.899 --> 21:40.731
Yes, you did.

21:40.733 --> 21:45.069
DRACULA:
<i>With Creepmas now saved</i>
<i>for my Mavy too,</i>

21:45.071 --> 21:48.105
<i>I knew it was time,</i>
<i>I was right on cue,</i>

21:48.107 --> 21:50.975
<i>to fly like a bat</i>
<i>out into the night,</i>

21:50.977 --> 21:53.711
yelling scary Creepmas to all

21:53.713 --> 21:56.013
<i>and to all a good fright!</i>

21:56.015 --> 22:00.618
(LAUGHING)
Scary Creepmas, Dad.

22:06.591 --> 22:08.959

22:09.494 --> 22:12.496
(VOCALIZING)
