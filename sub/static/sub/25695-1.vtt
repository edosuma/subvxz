00:35.744 --> 00:38.038
<i>To achieve glory in Roman society,</i>

00:41.124 --> 00:43.627
<i>every man must excel on the battlefield.</i>

00:49.383 --> 00:52.511
<i>One of those men is a 19-year-old recruit</i>

00:53.470 --> 00:55.264
<i>named Julius Caesar.</i>

00:57.558 --> 00:59.184
Push forward!

01:57.534 --> 01:58.869
Come on!

01:59.786 --> 02:02.539
<i>This will be Caesar's
first brush with death.</i>

02:06.627 --> 02:08.169
<i>But it won't be his last.</i>

03:46.727 --> 03:50.605
<i>Long before he becomes one
of the most powerful leaders in history,</i>

03:53.150 --> 03:56.361
<i>Julius Caesar is a lowly soldier
in the Roman army.</i>

03:59.114 --> 04:00.782
Hurry up! We march in an hour!

04:05.954 --> 04:08.373
<i>Caesar is born into
a wealthy family,</i>

04:09.207 --> 04:12.002
<i>but when his father joins
the wrong side of a civil war,</i>

04:12.836 --> 04:15.464
<i>the family is stripped
of their power and wealth.</i>

04:17.214 --> 04:18.884
<i>And by the age of 16,</i>

04:19.341 --> 04:21.261
<i>Caesar is left with nothing.</i>

04:27.017 --> 04:28.477
<i>Penniless and disgraced,</i>

04:30.020 --> 04:32.814
<i>he knows the only way to regain
his family's glory</i>

04:33.982 --> 04:35.192
<i>is through the military.</i>

04:37.486 --> 04:42.532
Caesar seems to been driven by the same
desires as many man of the day,

04:42.616 --> 04:44.367
the desire to be the wealthiest,

04:44.993 --> 04:48.038
the most celebrated,
the most famous of all.

04:49.539 --> 04:51.958
Glory was the one thing
that all Romans wanted.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.419
That lay in military success.

04:58.089 --> 05:00.175
<i>Over the course of a decade,</i>

05:02.803 --> 05:05.472
<i>Caesar works his way up
through the military ranks,</i>

05:06.431 --> 05:09.434
<i>becoming a battle-hardened warrior
along the way.</i>

05:20.904 --> 05:23.657
Julius Caesar was able to show himself
as a superior soldier.

05:25.158 --> 05:28.620
Many people soldiered on,
but he was actually better than others.

05:31.039 --> 05:35.335
One of the hallmarks of Caesar was that
he would throw himself into battle.

05:35.794 --> 05:38.255
There was enormous personal risk.

05:40.549 --> 05:41.675
Push forward!

05:47.013 --> 05:49.432
<i>Caesar and thousands of
other soldiers</i>

05:49.558 --> 05:51.810
<i>are conquering territory for Rome.</i>

05:54.354 --> 05:56.106
<i>In the last 400 years,</i>

05:56.773 --> 05:59.985
<i>Rome has expanded
from a city of just three square miles</i>

06:00.610 --> 06:05.073
<i>to a super-power of over
720,000 square miles,</i>

06:05.657 --> 06:08.285
<i>stretching from Africa to Asia.</i>

06:09.911 --> 06:11.496
At this moment in history,

06:11.621 --> 06:15.375
Rome is the most powerful state
in the Mediterranean.

06:15.834 --> 06:19.087
They had conquered everything
west of Greece

06:19.546 --> 06:22.591
and were beginning to expand
even further than that.

06:26.011 --> 06:29.890
<i>But Rome's military machine
requires one crucial component.</i>

06:32.684 --> 06:33.602
<i>Slaves.</i>

06:38.231 --> 06:43.153
<i>With each victory, the army captures
thousands of enemy soldiers and citizens,</i>

06:43.904 --> 06:46.489
<i>forcing them to fill
the least desirable jobs.</i>

06:49.743 --> 06:50.869
<i>Becoming servants.</i>

06:53.955 --> 06:54.789
<i>Gladiators.</i>

06:56.416 --> 06:59.461
<i>And most importantly, builders.</i>

07:02.672 --> 07:08.261
<i>Slaves construct new roadways so the army
can expand into even more territories.</i>

07:09.721 --> 07:12.182
The Romans were fantastic engineers.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.100
Without bulldozers, but with slaves.

07:14.893 --> 07:16.561
It's one of the keys to their success

07:16.645 --> 07:19.022
and they were really without peer
in that realm.

07:21.816 --> 07:23.610
<i>By 75 B.C.,</i>

07:23.693 --> 07:27.781
<i>more than two million slaves
have built nearly 50,000 miles of road,</i>

07:29.991 --> 07:32.786
<i>allowing the Republic
to continue to expand.</i>

07:36.498 --> 07:39.250
<i>It's a Roman system
that's worked for centuries...</i>

07:42.837 --> 07:45.173
<i>until Spartacus.</i>

07:58.228 --> 08:01.356
<i>While Caesar is building
his military career in central Italy,</i>

08:02.941 --> 08:07.070
<i>to the south,
an escaped slave leads a bloody revolt.</i>

08:08.196 --> 08:11.074
<i>He's a former gladiator named Spartacus.</i>

08:13.702 --> 08:15.704
<i>And he wants more than just freedom.</i>

08:16.413 --> 08:17.872
<i>He wants revenge.</i>

08:22.669 --> 08:25.797
<i>Spartacus leads a reign of terror
across Italy</i>

08:27.924 --> 08:30.260
<i>to punish the society that
enslaved him.</i>

08:35.974 --> 08:39.436
Spartacus had a very good chance
of success

08:39.519 --> 08:43.606
because of the core group of his fighters
were gladiators who still, at that time,

08:43.690 --> 08:47.694
had superior fighting techniques
to Roman legionnaires.

08:48.570 --> 08:51.656
So in hand-to-hand combat,
these folks were almost invincible.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.206
<i>As Spartacus and his troops move north,</i>

09:00.957 --> 09:03.460
<i>their army grows to 100,000 men.</i>

09:05.336 --> 09:11.051
Every troop that the Roman Senate
had sent out to try and defeat Spartacus

09:11.134 --> 09:12.844
had effectively been defeated.

09:12.927 --> 09:15.764
They weren't prepared
and it took them quite by surprise.

09:24.022 --> 09:28.026
<i>Now, Spartacus' army
is closing in on Rome.</i>

09:29.027 --> 09:34.032
<i>The only thing standing in their way
are 35,000 Roman soldiers.</i>

09:34.657 --> 09:37.577
<i>Among them is Julius Caesar.</i>

09:50.548 --> 09:53.802
42 wounded,

09:54.803 --> 09:56.137
25 killed.

09:57.555 --> 10:00.683
44 wounded,

10:01.935 --> 10:03.311
33 killed.

10:04.521 --> 10:07.023
<i>The general in charge
of Caesar's legion</i>

10:07.107 --> 10:10.693
<i>is a wealthy politician
named Marcus Crassus.</i>

10:12.779 --> 10:15.156
Crassus was the richest man in Rome.

10:15.281 --> 10:17.450
He wants to be a big politician.

10:17.534 --> 10:20.703
but to do that in Rome,
you had to have military success.

10:21.830 --> 10:24.541
Money was one thing,
but you needed to show also

10:24.624 --> 10:28.962
that you were capable of leading
the legions and of winning Rome glory.

10:30.672 --> 10:31.756
How many missing?

10:32.841 --> 10:37.053
At least a hundred. All presumed dead.

10:39.722 --> 10:40.849
We should fall back.

10:41.224 --> 10:44.185
Defend the road to Rome,
and wait for reinforcements.

10:46.229 --> 10:48.189
Shall I send scouts at first light?

10:48.773 --> 10:50.150
Fine. Do it.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.110
That's a mistake.

10:56.364 --> 10:57.323
Retreating...

10:58.366 --> 11:00.535
will give them time to regroup
and attack again.

11:01.286 --> 11:03.955
If we fall back, they'll chase us down,

11:04.581 --> 11:05.748
and pick us off as we go.

11:06.332 --> 11:09.294
Defending our position
is no longer an option.

11:09.627 --> 11:11.838
I'm not talking about
defending our position.

11:13.339 --> 11:16.342
We've been letting them
dictate the battle.

11:16.593 --> 11:17.760
What we need to do...

11:19.095 --> 11:20.388
is take the offensive.

11:21.264 --> 11:23.683
Engage them on our terms.

11:24.726 --> 11:26.603
- We are outnumbered.
- Let him speak.

11:31.149 --> 11:32.025
At daybreak.

11:32.859 --> 11:34.611
When they least expect it.

11:36.237 --> 11:37.864
Take them by surprise.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.116
This is our chance.

11:41.868 --> 11:45.205
Their main camp is here,
at the base of the mountain range.

11:48.583 --> 11:52.295
Caesar is a man of action
and a man of swiftness.

11:52.420 --> 11:53.671
He gets things done.

11:54.797 --> 11:56.966
This is not to say that Caesar's hasty.

11:57.175 --> 12:00.678
Caesar's very careful, cautious,
and calculating.

12:01.429 --> 12:04.891
We could split into two legions,
one from the east and one from the west.

12:08.186 --> 12:09.520
We'd have them surrounded.

12:11.564 --> 12:12.440
That's right.

12:24.827 --> 12:27.538
Give the orders. We march before dawn.

12:34.796 --> 12:36.673
<i>Caesar convinces Crassus,</i>

12:37.715 --> 12:39.467
<i>knowing that if his plan fails,</i>

12:40.051 --> 12:41.678
<i>Rome could be destroyed.</i>

13:00.905 --> 13:04.784
<i>For Caesar, the battle is about more
than just attaining power.</i>

13:05.868 --> 13:08.663
<i>It's about protecting everything
he holds dear.</i>

13:12.000 --> 13:15.044
<i>"Every day that passes
is a day closer to victory,</i>

13:16.129 --> 13:19.090
<i>and a day closer to coming home
to both of you.</i>

13:21.217 --> 13:23.970
<i>Not a day passes that I don't think
of the two of you.</i>

13:25.013 --> 13:27.640
<i>You're always in my thoughts
and in my prayers."</i>

13:29.017 --> 13:31.644
Caesar and Cornelia had been married
for 15 years.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.605
She had provided him
with a daughter, Julia.

13:36.274 --> 13:39.944
And he shows great loyalty
and devotion to his wife.

13:46.075 --> 13:47.285
I know you're tired.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.412
I know you're hungry.

13:51.998 --> 13:52.832
So am I.

13:55.084 --> 13:56.502
And so is our enemy.

13:57.378 --> 14:01.007
Spartacus and his men fight without fear,

14:02.383 --> 14:04.093
because they have nothing to lose.

14:05.803 --> 14:06.679
We do.

14:08.306 --> 14:10.266
And that's what makes us dangerous.

14:13.311 --> 14:15.605
When I fight side by side
with you tonight,

14:16.814 --> 14:18.274
I fight for my wife.

14:19.609 --> 14:21.152
And I fight for my daughter.

14:22.737 --> 14:24.155
We fight for our wives.

14:25.323 --> 14:26.282
Our daughters.

14:27.283 --> 14:28.326
We fight...

14:29.660 --> 14:31.412
because if we fail tonight,

14:32.622 --> 14:35.208
the enemy will slaughter them
without mercy.

14:38.836 --> 14:40.630
- Are you with me?
- Yes.

14:41.756 --> 14:43.132
Are you with me?

14:43.383 --> 14:44.759
Yes!

15:15.790 --> 15:17.708
<i>In the middle of the night,</i>

15:18.084 --> 15:21.671
<i>Caesar and a Roman legion head towards
Spartacus' camp,</i>

15:23.339 --> 15:25.049
<i>ready to strike at daybreak.</i>

17:01.687 --> 17:03.856
<i>After two years of bloody conflict,</i>

17:05.191 --> 17:07.193
<i>and more than 100,000 dead,</i>

17:09.111 --> 17:11.989
<i>Crassus has achieved
what was considered impossible:</i>

17:13.406 --> 17:14.784
<i>Killing Spartacus...</i>

17:16.661 --> 17:18.371
<i>and destroying his rebellion.</i>

17:20.122 --> 17:24.126
In the final battle
between Spartacus and Crassus' army,

17:24.210 --> 17:26.127
there was an immense slaughter.

17:26.378 --> 17:30.258
And although Spartacus died,
his body was never found.

17:36.931 --> 17:38.516
We've rounded up the prisoners.

17:40.309 --> 17:41.978
What do you want to do with them?

18:23.102 --> 18:24.979
This is a waste of resources.

18:27.189 --> 18:28.733
We could put them to good use.

18:29.859 --> 18:31.902
Carrying our equipment, setting up camp.

18:35.323 --> 18:36.782
They're worthless to us dead.

18:38.534 --> 18:40.911
They're proof of what I did.

18:43.414 --> 18:44.624
Of what we did.

18:58.429 --> 19:00.139
<i>To glorify his victory,</i>

19:02.391 --> 19:05.102
<i>Crassus orders 6,000
of the captured rebels</i>

19:05.186 --> 19:07.438
<i>to be crucified along the road to Rome.</i>

19:12.026 --> 19:13.611
<i>One every 100 feet...</i>

19:15.071 --> 19:16.530
<i>for 60 miles.</i>

19:29.502 --> 19:31.087
<i>With Spartacus' defeat,</i>

19:32.505 --> 19:34.757
<i>Crassus hopes that his newfound glory</i>

19:35.424 --> 19:38.260
<i>will allow him to gain
political power back in Rome...</i>

19:40.638 --> 19:43.307
<i>by being elected to the highest office
in the land,</i>

19:44.225 --> 19:45.059
<i>the consul.</i>

19:51.607 --> 19:55.486
<i>In 70 B.C., Rome is not yet an empire.</i>

19:56.654 --> 19:57.988
<i>It's a republic,</i>

19:58.989 --> 20:00.825
<i>home to nearly four million people,</i>

20:01.826 --> 20:03.369
<i>from wealthy politicians</i>

20:04.370 --> 20:05.663
<i>to lowly slaves.</i>

20:08.165 --> 20:09.959
<i>Instead of an emperor or a king,</i>

20:11.127 --> 20:13.337
<i>Romans are governed by an elected senate.</i>

20:17.133 --> 20:19.301
<i>But ruling over them is the consul,</i>

20:20.803 --> 20:24.265
<i>an official who wields more power
than any other man in Rome.</i>

20:26.016 --> 20:30.146
The consuls were the chief executive
of the Republic.

20:30.688 --> 20:33.023
They were the commander-in-chief
of the armies,

20:33.107 --> 20:35.860
invested with supreme power.

20:35.985 --> 20:38.112
They were the most powerful man in Rome.

20:39.280 --> 20:40.531
<i>For Caesar,</i>

20:40.614 --> 20:44.034
<i>supporting a potential consul
puts him on track</i>

20:44.118 --> 20:46.495
<i>to rise quickly within the government.</i>

20:47.204 --> 20:49.665
Caesar aligned himself with
Crassus because

20:49.749 --> 20:53.252
he saw it as a way that would lead
to his own path to power.

20:54.086 --> 20:57.173
Crassus had the wealth
and the political connections,

20:57.590 --> 21:00.342
and so Crassus was
a very important person for him.

21:01.343 --> 21:04.096
<i>But Crassus is not the only
military leader</i>

21:04.305 --> 21:05.973
<i>with his sights on the consul.</i>

21:10.686 --> 21:12.104
<i>One hundred miles away,</i>

21:13.022 --> 21:17.109
<i>another general is looking to claim glory
in the war against Spartacus.</i>

21:21.030 --> 21:23.908
<i>His name is Pompey Magnus.</i>

21:28.621 --> 21:29.955
We've just received word.

21:31.665 --> 21:32.833
Spartacus has fallen.

21:35.669 --> 21:36.629
The war's over.

21:38.130 --> 21:38.964
How?

21:39.715 --> 21:41.300
Defeated by Crassus' legion.

21:49.141 --> 21:50.476
What remains of his army?

21:51.685 --> 21:53.437
They've all been killed or taken captive.

21:53.771 --> 21:54.605
All of them?

21:56.065 --> 21:59.485
Tens of thousands of rebels,
and all of them have been killed

21:59.568 --> 22:01.195
or captured by Crassus?

22:01.779 --> 22:02.822
Some might have escaped.

22:05.074 --> 22:05.950
Find them.

22:07.284 --> 22:09.203
Order the scouts to track them down.

22:10.246 --> 22:12.540
And order the men to break camp,
I want them ready to march.

22:33.269 --> 22:34.436
If there was no Julius Caesar,

22:34.520 --> 22:37.022
Pompey would be known to us
as the greatest military commander

22:37.106 --> 22:39.191
that the Roman republic had ever produced.

22:41.026 --> 22:45.364
This is someone who was really driven
by his own personal ego

22:45.447 --> 22:48.534
and he tried to take as much credit
as he possibly could.

22:49.159 --> 22:52.538
So, at the very last minute,
Pompey tried to cash in

22:52.621 --> 22:55.624
on Crassus' success
against the Spartacus revolt.

23:01.839 --> 23:04.800
<i>Pompey rounds up slaves
who escaped the battle</i>

23:04.884 --> 23:06.302
<i>and quickly slaughters them.</i>

23:09.680 --> 23:12.057
<i>Now, all he has to do is return to Rome</i>

23:13.100 --> 23:14.351
<i>before Crassus.</i>

23:20.649 --> 23:21.984
More wine!

23:22.067 --> 23:23.360
More wine!

23:23.444 --> 23:24.278
Hear, hear.

23:26.864 --> 23:27.698
Here.

23:29.575 --> 23:32.703
Crassus successfully defeats
Spartacus's army.

23:33.329 --> 23:35.372
But then,
Pompey goes back to Rome and says,

23:35.456 --> 23:39.668
"I am actually the one who finished off
the slave uprising.

23:39.752 --> 23:42.212
I am the one who led the last battle."

23:42.504 --> 23:45.132
This is definitely something
that Pompey would do.

23:45.466 --> 23:47.885
Pompey gets all the credit,
Pompey gets all the glory

23:47.968 --> 23:50.012
and Crassus is still looked down on.

24:03.400 --> 24:04.234
What's this?

24:06.445 --> 24:10.032
What do you think it is?
We're celebrating Spartacus' defeat.

24:10.824 --> 24:12.826
At whose hands? Yours?

24:14.620 --> 24:16.121
Don't bring down the mood.

24:17.414 --> 24:19.541
You look exhausted. Please, help yourself.

24:19.625 --> 24:21.460
Tell them or I will.

24:28.926 --> 24:30.511
I want to make an announcement.

24:32.137 --> 24:35.099
I know we're all here to celebrate
my victory over Spartacus,

24:35.182 --> 24:37.101
and putting down the rebellion, but...

24:38.185 --> 24:39.687
I can't take all the credit.

24:42.523 --> 24:44.066
Had it not been for Crassus

24:44.942 --> 24:45.943
and his men,

24:46.819 --> 24:49.655
I might not have been able
to defeat Spartacus in battle.

24:51.657 --> 24:54.827
So please, a toast to our guests.

24:57.204 --> 24:59.206
I couldn't have done it
without their help.

24:59.456 --> 25:01.250
- Hear, hear!
- Hear, hear!

25:05.504 --> 25:08.090
What exactly did you hope to accomplish
coming here?

25:10.718 --> 25:14.013
Did you think anyone would believe you
without Spartacus' head?

25:23.772 --> 25:25.190
There's been enough blood.

25:26.984 --> 25:29.486
My men won't hesitate to spill yours.

25:33.365 --> 25:34.241
Leave.

25:39.204 --> 25:40.164
It's not worth it.

25:41.623 --> 25:43.333
You should listen to your friend.

25:45.461 --> 25:46.295
Come on.

25:53.385 --> 25:55.012
Congratulations...

25:56.430 --> 25:57.389
on your victory.

26:09.693 --> 26:13.197
<i>With Pompey taking credit
for the victory against Spartacus,</i>

26:13.822 --> 26:17.117
<i>Caesar fears he's lost his chance
to move up in the government.</i>

26:18.327 --> 26:20.079
<i>But at least he's finally home.</i>

26:23.832 --> 26:25.000
<i>It's lovely to see you.</i>

26:26.418 --> 26:28.587
- We missed you.
- Well, I missed you too.

26:29.213 --> 26:30.380
I liked your letters.

26:30.964 --> 26:32.299
Oh, you got them?

26:34.593 --> 26:37.429
<i>He may be reunited
with his wife and daughter,</i>

26:38.639 --> 26:40.015
<i>but Caesar doesn't realize</i>

26:40.099 --> 26:42.434
<i>that he's about to be pushed
into a new war...</i>

26:43.811 --> 26:46.355
<i>between the two most powerful men in Rome.</i>

27:06.291 --> 27:09.128
Pompey had returned
from campaigns in the east,

27:09.211 --> 27:11.880
and he wanted land
for his veteran soldiers.

27:13.298 --> 27:19.263
The soldiers looked to their commanders
to provide for them upon returning home.

27:20.139 --> 27:21.557
But there were some in the Senate,

27:21.640 --> 27:24.726
and especially the circle
that was grouping around Crassus,

27:24.810 --> 27:26.478
who didn't like Pompey.

27:26.562 --> 27:30.107
They wanted to make life difficult
for him, to put him back in his place.

27:38.323 --> 27:41.952
It is time to award land in Campania
to the seventh and eighth legions.

27:43.328 --> 27:48.375
We cannot begin giving away land
before sufficient oversight is in place.

27:49.418 --> 27:53.213
Until there is a functioning system
of government in the region,

27:53.297 --> 27:54.256
we have no control.

27:54.339 --> 27:57.885
Sufficient oversight is in place
and will improve as time goes on.

28:00.429 --> 28:02.681
We owe it to these men
to give them their due,

28:02.764 --> 28:04.641
after all they have sacrificed.

28:05.309 --> 28:08.437
No one is questioning their sacrifice.

28:09.396 --> 28:14.318
Once oversight is established,
his soldiers will get what they're owed.

28:14.943 --> 28:17.571
It is just a matter of proper procedure.

28:17.654 --> 28:19.698
How long must these men wait?

28:22.242 --> 28:23.243
An exception must be made.

28:23.327 --> 28:27.164
Pompey doesn't think
the rules of the Senate apply to him.

28:30.459 --> 28:32.544
Don't let him push you around.

28:32.628 --> 28:35.172
If we do not make good on our promises,

28:36.131 --> 28:38.300
what loyalty will these men have to Rome?

28:39.801 --> 28:41.053
Postpone the vote...

28:42.012 --> 28:43.680
further debate is still required.

28:46.725 --> 28:50.062
There had been virtual gridlock
between Pompey and Crassus.

28:50.729 --> 28:54.483
They had argued constantly,
and so nothing had been achieved.

28:55.484 --> 28:58.487
All those in favor of postponing the vote?

29:06.453 --> 29:07.996
The vote is postponed.

29:14.253 --> 29:16.129
The look on his face...

29:19.091 --> 29:20.384
Pompey won't let this go.

29:20.550 --> 29:21.885
There's nothing he can do.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.554
His legions are standing by,

29:24.638 --> 29:27.266
just outside Rome, waiting to attack
at a moment's notice.

29:27.599 --> 29:29.893
They're waiting to collect their payment,

29:30.227 --> 29:31.061
nothing more.

29:32.521 --> 29:36.400
Once they realize the lands
they've been promised won't be released,

29:36.984 --> 29:37.901
they'll disperse.

29:38.193 --> 29:39.027
Will they?

29:40.070 --> 29:41.113
If it comes to it,

29:41.863 --> 29:43.657
my legions are stationed nearby.

29:48.537 --> 29:50.205
I've seen you on the battlefield.

29:50.789 --> 29:52.165
You're not afraid to fight.

29:52.708 --> 29:54.543
Pompey has more men.

29:54.626 --> 29:57.587
My army brought down Spartacus.

29:58.255 --> 29:59.172
Not his.

30:02.092 --> 30:04.094
If war is coming,

30:04.803 --> 30:07.180
I need to know you're on my side.

30:11.310 --> 30:12.185
Of course.

30:25.365 --> 30:27.993
<i>After over a decade
of peace within Rome,</i>

30:29.202 --> 30:32.289
<i>Caesar finds himself
caught in the middle of a bitter feud</i>

30:33.540 --> 30:35.500
<i>that's edging towards violence.</i>

30:37.502 --> 30:40.589
<i>But suddenly,
he's faced with a new crisis.</i>

31:09.951 --> 31:15.374
<i>Caesar's wife of 15 years, Cornelia,
falls gravely ill.</i>

31:59.960 --> 32:01.169
You sent for the doctor?

32:03.213 --> 32:04.673
He'll be here in the morning.

32:09.010 --> 32:10.137
You get some rest.

32:13.640 --> 32:14.891
I'll take care of her.

33:13.158 --> 33:15.744
<i>While Caesar mourns
the loss of his wife,</i>

33:17.412 --> 33:19.581
<i>tensions between Crassus and Pompey</i>

33:21.416 --> 33:22.834
<i>continue to escalate.</i>

33:33.136 --> 33:36.932
The government had reached a point
where nothing was going on,

33:37.015 --> 33:40.227
nothing was happening,
nothing was being done anymore.

33:40.310 --> 33:41.770
Even something as simple

33:41.853 --> 33:45.690
as approving the vast territories
that Pompey had conquered,

33:45.774 --> 33:47.567
not even that could get done anymore.

33:47.651 --> 33:51.363
The Romans couldn't even approve
a military conquest anymore.

33:54.199 --> 33:56.117
<i>As the stalemate continues,</i>

33:57.202 --> 34:01.414
<i>Crassus and Pompey prepare their armies
to march on Rome at any moment...</i>

34:02.624 --> 34:04.876
<i>threatening to spark a civil war.</i>

34:06.461 --> 34:10.507
Everyone worried about
where all this was going to end.

34:10.590 --> 34:14.219
What was Pompey's end goal?
What was Crassus really up to?

34:23.812 --> 34:27.274
<i>Years earlier, Caesar watched
as his father aligned himself</i>

34:27.357 --> 34:29.192
<i>with the wrong side of a civil war,</i>

34:30.985 --> 34:32.904
<i>ruining his family's reputation.</i>

34:34.822 --> 34:38.368
<i>Now, he's determined
not to repeat those mistakes.</i>

34:39.828 --> 34:42.455
Pompey had great military glory.

34:42.746 --> 34:44.498
Crassus had all the money.

34:45.333 --> 34:48.920
For Caesar, it's a great risk
as to which side he should back,

34:49.004 --> 34:51.505
because he knows
that if he backs the wrong man,

34:51.590 --> 34:53.174
he can lose everything.

34:56.219 --> 34:59.514
<i>As Caesar watches
the conflict spiral out of control,</i>

35:00.640 --> 35:03.935
<i>he realizes that he can use the crisis
to his advantage.</i>

35:18.408 --> 35:22.746
<i>Caesar devises a plan
that's as dangerous as it is brilliant.</i>

35:24.414 --> 35:28.585
<i>If it fails, everything he's worked for
will be destroyed.</i>

35:29.919 --> 35:31.338
<i>But if it succeeds,</i>

35:32.005 --> 35:34.591
<i>it could be the opportunity of a lifetime.</i>

35:37.552 --> 35:42.557
Caesar was far and away one
of the most ambitious figures in history.

35:42.641 --> 35:45.602
His life was filled with this drive
for power,

35:45.685 --> 35:48.980
this ambition for greater glory,
this desire

35:49.064 --> 35:51.483
to be at the top of the Republican system.

36:32.065 --> 36:32.899
You're late.

36:33.733 --> 36:35.568
You should be happy I came at all.

36:38.113 --> 36:39.239
What do you want?

36:40.407 --> 36:42.325
I'll tell you when we're all here.

36:43.576 --> 36:45.453
Your message said to come alone.

36:45.995 --> 36:46.830
It did.

36:50.709 --> 36:51.543
What is this?

36:53.169 --> 36:54.003
Trust me.

36:54.713 --> 36:56.005
We're here to talk.

37:03.930 --> 37:06.933
You two are the most powerful men in Rome.

37:08.143 --> 37:10.228
But as long you fight each other,

37:10.645 --> 37:12.480
neither of you will get what you want.

37:13.314 --> 37:14.816
You won't get your tax cuts,

37:15.525 --> 37:18.194
and you will never pay off your soldiers.

37:19.279 --> 37:20.572
You're in a stalemate.

37:21.072 --> 37:22.574
And the only way to break it,

37:23.450 --> 37:24.784
is to work together.

37:26.035 --> 37:27.912
Then, nothing will stand in your way.

37:30.582 --> 37:32.041
Why should I trust him?

37:33.877 --> 37:35.670
Because the only other option
is civil war.

37:38.423 --> 37:40.300
And what do you get out of all this?

37:42.802 --> 37:45.013
You'll need someone in the Senate
with enough authority

37:45.096 --> 37:46.431
to push your laws through.

37:47.307 --> 37:48.558
And for obvious reasons,

37:49.267 --> 37:50.685
that can't be either of you.

37:54.439 --> 37:55.648
Get me elected consul,

37:56.816 --> 37:59.110
and I'll make sure
your legislation gets passed.

38:02.447 --> 38:04.824
Of course,
the real power will rest with you.

38:09.120 --> 38:12.624
And how do I know once I get you elected
that you two won't turn on me?

38:16.002 --> 38:18.213
I'll push your legislation through first.

38:18.671 --> 38:19.881
No, that's not enough.

38:19.964 --> 38:23.343
- I think that's more than enough.
- Legislation can be repealed.

38:25.678 --> 38:26.971
You'll need to do better.

38:43.321 --> 38:46.991
Caesar's driving ambition
was to be the consul of Rome.

38:48.201 --> 38:51.663
From the time that Caesar
was a little kid,

38:52.413 --> 38:53.915
he wanted to be the consul of Rome.

38:53.998 --> 38:56.292
I think he expected that of himself

38:56.376 --> 38:59.254
and it was what he was aiming at
his entire life.

39:53.558 --> 39:54.726
The vows of marriage

39:55.518 --> 39:58.354
are a sacred bond
which can never be broken...

40:02.483 --> 40:03.943
<i>To earn his trust,</i>

40:04.652 --> 40:07.530
<i>Caesar offers Pompey
his daughter's hand in marriage.</i>

40:12.493 --> 40:14.120
<i>The marriage marks the beginning</i>

40:14.203 --> 40:16.956
<i>of the most powerful alliance
in Roman history...</i>

40:19.042 --> 40:20.460
<i>that will come to be known</i>

40:21.419 --> 40:22.879
<i>as the Triumvirate.</i>

40:27.425 --> 40:29.302
Do you swear by the gods,

40:29.385 --> 40:32.430
to loyally serve the Senate
and the people of Rome?

40:33.222 --> 40:38.186
I swear by the gods, to loyally serve
the Senate and the people of Rome.

40:39.896 --> 40:43.858
Caesar brought Crassus and Pompey
together to advance his own career.

40:44.609 --> 40:46.694
He needs the money from Crassus,

40:46.778 --> 40:49.364
and then also the support of Pompey
to win the consulship

40:49.447 --> 40:51.407
that he's been after for his whole life...

40:51.908 --> 40:55.286
It is with the approval of the Senate,
that I hereby name you,

40:56.371 --> 40:59.123
Julius Caesar, Consul of Rome.

41:03.503 --> 41:07.507
...so that the three of them
can then go forth and dominate Rome

41:07.590 --> 41:10.760
as no three men had ever
dominated Rome before.

41:13.763 --> 41:15.223
<i>But within a year,</i>

41:15.473 --> 41:17.976
<i>everything they've built
will begin to collapse.</i>

41:19.102 --> 41:22.605
<i>And Julius Caesar will find himself
on the frontlines</i>

41:22.689 --> 41:25.566
<i>of the biggest war Rome has ever known.</i>

41:31.948 --> 41:33.032
