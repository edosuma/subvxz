of looking at that.

01:47.607 --> 01:49.007
What?
That empty space.

01:49.009 --> 01:51.509
It just reminds me that
Cleveland's not here anymore.

01:51.511 --> 01:53.611
Yeah, it's just not the same
without him.

01:53.613 --> 01:54.979
I sure wish he...

01:54.981 --> 01:57.082
Hey, guys, look!

01:57.950 --> 01:58.983
It's him!

01:58.985 --> 01:59.517
Hey, Cleveland!

01:59.519 --> 02:02.854
Why didn't you tell us
you were back, buddy?

02:02.856 --> 02:04.489
Oh, it's a lamp.

02:06.025 --> 02:08.026
You know, guys,
I've been thinkin'.

02:08.028 --> 02:10.295
We need a new fourth guy
for our group.

02:10.297 --> 02:11.329
We're a man short.

02:11.331 --> 02:13.331
Like Stadler
without Waldorf.

02:13.333 --> 02:13.965
(laughing)

02:13.967 --> 02:16.167
You know, without the other guy
yappin' in my ear,

02:16.169 --> 02:18.169
these guys aren't half bad.

02:20.973 --> 02:23.274
Now I know you're interested
in being the fourth guy

02:23.276 --> 02:25.844
in our entourage,
Kevin Connolly, but don't you

02:25.846 --> 02:27.712
think you're a little small?
Listen, I tell you what.

02:27.714 --> 02:30.715
You can be in our group
if I can have some
of your cereal.

02:30.717 --> 02:34.219
Oh, no! They're after
me Kevin Connolly Charms!

02:39.358 --> 02:41.159
How's your friend
search going?

02:41.161 --> 02:43.027
(sighs) Not great, Lois.
What friend search?

02:43.029 --> 02:45.196
Oh, we're just trying to find
a friend to replace Cleveland.

02:45.198 --> 02:47.298
We've been meeting people
for the past three days.

02:47.300 --> 02:48.967
Well, you don't need
to look for somebody new.

02:48.969 --> 02:50.969
I'll hang out
with you guys.
Yeah, you know,

02:50.971 --> 02:52.504
I don't think that's
gonna work out, Brian,

02:52.506 --> 02:54.339
'cause of the whole
Quagmire thing.

02:54.341 --> 02:55.273
What Quagmire thing?

02:55.275 --> 02:57.208
Oh, you know, just
that he hates you.

02:57.210 --> 02:58.576
Quagmire hates me?
Hates you.

02:58.578 --> 03:01.279
I-I don't get it.
Why, why wouldn't
Quagmire like me?

03:01.281 --> 03:02.714
Because he thinks
you're annoying.

03:02.716 --> 03:05.150
Like people who never
shut up about their kids.

03:05.152 --> 03:07.519
He... he would have
been four today.

03:07.521 --> 03:10.155
I-I still don't
understand.

03:10.157 --> 03:12.724
How do you drown
in an inch of water?

03:12.726 --> 03:14.192
(sobbing)
Well...

03:14.194 --> 03:18.563
I guess I don't
have a new sweater
and a haircut.

03:22.067 --> 03:23.301
(sighs):
Who would've thought

03:23.303 --> 03:24.702
it would be this hard
to replace Cleveland?

03:24.704 --> 03:26.504
You know, guys,
we've kind of been

03:26.506 --> 03:27.539
ignoring the obvious here.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.507
I mean, if you really
break it down,

03:29.509 --> 03:31.042
what we need is a black guy.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.311
Yeah, that was the best thing
about Cleveland.

03:33.313 --> 03:35.246
Oh, by far.
I sure do miss him.

03:35.248 --> 03:37.248
Peter's right.
We gotta find another black guy.

03:37.250 --> 03:38.550
Yeah, 'cause
otherwise we're just

03:38.552 --> 03:40.151
a bunch of boring
white guys.

03:40.153 --> 03:42.287
Like a London
gentlemen's club.

03:42.289 --> 03:44.989
(clears throat)

03:44.991 --> 03:47.025
(clears throat)

03:47.027 --> 03:48.459
(clears throat)

03:48.461 --> 03:49.594
(clears throat)

03:49.596 --> 03:51.029
(clears throat)

03:51.031 --> 03:52.931

03:52.933 --> 03:54.666
(clears throat)

03:54.668 --> 03:56.467
(clears throat)

03:56.469 --> 03:58.303
(clears throat)

03:58.305 --> 03:59.671
(clears throat louder)

03:59.673 --> 04:01.072
(clears throat)

04:01.074 --> 04:02.574
(clears throat loudly)

04:02.576 --> 04:04.242
(clears throat
even louder)

04:04.244 --> 04:05.743
(clears throat
loudly)

04:05.745 --> 04:08.146
(clears throat
even louder)

04:08.148 --> 04:09.781
(clears throat
loudly)

04:09.783 --> 04:11.616
(clears throat
loudly)

04:11.618 --> 04:15.253
(angrily clears throat)

04:15.255 --> 04:18.590
(annoyingly
clears throat)

04:18.592 --> 04:20.859
(clears throat
noisily)

04:20.861 --> 04:22.293
(clears throat)

04:22.295 --> 04:23.528
(clears throat)

04:23.530 --> 04:26.197
(clears throat quietly)

04:26.199 --> 04:27.532
(clears throat
a bit softer)

04:27.534 --> 04:29.434
(clears throat
even softer)

04:29.436 --> 04:30.635
(clears throat softly)

04:30.637 --> 04:31.803
(clears throat
briefly)

04:31.805 --> 04:34.405
(clears throat
softly)

04:34.407 --> 04:36.841
(clears throat
very quietly)

04:36.942 --> 04:39.377
Hey, you guys want to
enter the darts tournament?

04:39.379 --> 04:41.045
First prize is free
drinks all night.

04:41.047 --> 04:43.548
Oh, we'd love to,
Horace, but there's
only three of us.

04:43.550 --> 04:45.516
MAN:
Did I hear some sorry ass fools

04:45.518 --> 04:48.353
in need of a motherlovin'
fourth?

04:52.925 --> 04:55.026
I'll join
your darts game.

04:55.028 --> 04:57.061
How do we know
you're any good?

05:00.466 --> 05:04.502
Gentlemen,
we got us a black man.

05:05.571 --> 05:07.972
(all laughing)

05:08.340 --> 05:10.742
Oh, boy,
what a fantastic evening.

05:10.744 --> 05:14.279
Jerome, you are a wonderful
addition to our group.

05:14.281 --> 05:15.480
Hey, thanks, Peter.

05:15.482 --> 05:16.281
I like you guys, too.

05:16.283 --> 05:18.583
What do you say we hit
another bar, keep it goin'?

05:18.585 --> 05:22.253
I can't. There's a girl
tied up in my basement
who needs some food.

05:22.255 --> 05:24.622
That's funny.
You funny, pointy man.

05:24.624 --> 05:27.992
Yeah, I...
I joke around a lot.

05:32.197 --> 05:33.531
Thanks for the lift
home, Jerome.

05:33.533 --> 05:35.199
Hey, if you got
time to come in,

05:35.201 --> 05:36.301
I'd love for you
to meet my wife.

05:36.303 --> 05:38.436
I got time for
whatever I want, fool.

05:38.438 --> 05:41.072
My watch don't tell
time, I tell it.

05:41.074 --> 05:44.309
Wow, you're cooler than
a York Peppermint Pattie.

05:44.311 --> 05:46.778
When I bite
into a York Peppermint Pattie,

05:46.780 --> 05:48.513
I get the sensation...

05:48.515 --> 05:51.582
of being on a frozen
mountaintop!

05:51.584 --> 05:54.485
<i>It has been two months</i>
<i>since I made the tragic choice</i>

05:54.487 --> 05:56.955
<i>to bite into</i>
<i>a York Peppermint Pattie,</i>

05:56.957 --> 05:58.456
<i>and still I have made</i>
<i>no progress</i>

05:58.458 --> 06:00.391
<i>finding my way</i>
<i>out of the mountains.</i>

06:00.393 --> 06:02.327
<i>The only food I have</i>
<i>is the rest of this</i>

06:02.329 --> 06:04.429
<i>York Peppermint Pattie,</i>
<i>which unfortunately,</i>

06:04.431 --> 06:06.931
<i>keeps bringing me back</i>

06:06.933 --> 06:10.702
<i>If anyone finds this,</i>
<i>tell my family I love them.</i>

06:10.704 --> 06:14.105
...of being on a
frozen mountaintop!

06:17.109 --> 06:20.078
Hey, Lois. I'd like you
to meet our new friend...

06:20.080 --> 06:20.979
Jerome?

06:20.981 --> 06:21.646
Loose Lois?

06:21.648 --> 06:24.349
Wha... you guys
know each other?

06:24.351 --> 06:25.249
Know each other?

06:25.251 --> 06:27.852
Peter, Jerome is an
old boyfriend of mine.

06:27.854 --> 06:29.454
What?!
(Stewie yawning)

06:29.456 --> 06:32.557
Sorry, I was out of it.
Wait, are we being robbed?

06:37.196 --> 06:39.497
Peter, I know I told
you about Jerome.

06:39.499 --> 06:42.333
Lois, I would've remembered
if you told me that.

06:42.335 --> 06:43.301
I told you, Peter.

06:43.303 --> 06:45.603
I remember exactly
what we were doing.

06:45.605 --> 06:48.072
(both laughing)

06:49.441 --> 06:50.608
I slept with a black guy.

06:50.610 --> 06:54.212
I hope this doesn't make
you feel awkward, my man.

06:54.214 --> 06:55.480
It was a long time ago.

06:55.482 --> 06:57.548
Hey, that's
a beautiful baby.

06:57.550 --> 06:59.150
Mind if I hold him?

06:59.152 --> 07:00.485
Go right ahead.

07:00.487 --> 07:01.486
Hey there, lil' fella.

07:01.488 --> 07:02.787
What's that around
your neck?

07:02.789 --> 07:05.723
Well, I say, it's
a little Black Jesus.

07:05.725 --> 07:07.825
♪ Black Jesus.

07:07.827 --> 07:10.661
I rode into town
on an ass.

07:10.663 --> 07:12.563
Your mama's ass.

07:12.565 --> 07:15.233
♪ Black Jesus.

07:15.235 --> 07:16.801
It was really good
to see you, Lois.

07:16.803 --> 07:19.670
We should grab a coffee
or something and catch up.

07:19.672 --> 07:21.239
That would be great.

07:21.241 --> 07:23.207
It was really nice
to see you, too.

07:23.209 --> 07:24.542
Well, it's gettin'
late, Jerome.

07:24.544 --> 07:26.210
I'm sure you got stuff to do.

07:26.212 --> 07:28.312
Yeah, I gotta go down
to the gas station

07:28.314 --> 07:30.415
and buy a framed
painting of a tiger.

07:30.417 --> 07:32.116
Catch y'all later.

07:32.118 --> 07:35.253
You're not really gonna
hang out with him, Lois, are ya?

07:35.255 --> 07:36.387
We're just friends, Peter.

07:36.389 --> 07:37.555
Don't tell me
you're jealous?

07:37.557 --> 07:41.225
Well, you datin' that guy?
It's just a lot to take in.

07:41.227 --> 07:42.760
(laughs):
Oh, you're tellin' me.

07:42.762 --> 07:45.463
Oh, come on! Those kinds
of jokes aren't helpin'.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.365
Well, what do you
want me to say?

07:47.367 --> 07:48.366
You're bein' silly.

07:48.368 --> 07:51.769
I mean, Jerome and I
dated over 12 inches ago.

07:51.771 --> 07:53.571
(laughs):
I said inches!

07:53.573 --> 07:55.940
What did I just say?!
I'm sorry.

07:55.942 --> 07:58.009
I'm sorry. Okay,
look, just relax.

07:58.011 --> 08:00.478
You're my husband
and I love you,

08:00.480 --> 08:02.847
so just put Jerome
out of your head.

08:03.315 --> 08:06.417
Get him out of my life
is more like it.

08:08.220 --> 08:10.688
Brian, I just found
out Chris Farley died.

08:10.690 --> 08:12.723
Yeah, that happened,
like, 12 years ago.

08:12.725 --> 08:14.292
But I just watched
Tommy Boy yesterday.

08:14.294 --> 08:15.827
He was right there.
Yeah, that's a movie.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.262
It's shot beforehand.
It's not happening right now.

08:18.264 --> 08:20.731
Really? But I thought
my knocking on the TV glass

08:20.733 --> 08:23.267
distracted him,
and that's what made
him fall down that hill.

08:23.269 --> 08:26.337
(laughing):
Oh, oh, seeing him
fall down that hill

08:26.339 --> 08:27.605
put me in a good humor!

08:27.607 --> 08:28.372
Stewie, get lost.

08:28.374 --> 08:30.274
What are you doing
just standing out here?

08:30.276 --> 08:32.310
I'm waiting for Quagmire
to get his mail.

08:32.312 --> 08:33.845
I'm gonna conveniently
stroll by

08:33.847 --> 08:35.413
and strike up a
conversation with him,

08:35.415 --> 08:36.781
and maybe find out
why he hates me.

08:36.783 --> 08:38.683
Oh, I'm sure it's just
a misunderstanding.

08:38.685 --> 08:41.085
You'll smooth it over.

08:43.355 --> 08:45.389
Hey, Quagmire,
what a coincidence.

08:45.391 --> 08:47.425
You and me just runnin'
into each other.

08:47.427 --> 08:49.594
How, how ya doin'?
Fine.

08:51.797 --> 08:53.598
Oh, takin' a break, huh?

08:53.600 --> 08:54.866
She's a hot piece of ass.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.968
And from the looks of it,
she likes it rough.

08:56.970 --> 08:57.969
That's my sister, Brian.

08:57.971 --> 08:59.704
Her boyfriend has been
beating her mercilessly.

08:59.706 --> 09:02.473
The last thing she'd
want right now is to
be objectified.

09:02.475 --> 09:03.975
Oh, God.
I'm-I'm really sorry.

09:03.977 --> 09:08.379
I got a deaf brother,
you want to make fun
of him, too?

09:08.381 --> 09:09.413
(door closes)

09:09.415 --> 09:11.115
(brakes screeching)

09:12.718 --> 09:14.752
MAN: Where is she?
QUAGMIRE:
She's not here.

09:14.754 --> 09:16.287
HARRIET:
Get out, Jeff!

09:16.289 --> 09:17.321
Just get out of here!

09:17.323 --> 09:18.756
Oh, I'll get out
when I'm finished.

09:18.758 --> 09:20.358
(punch landing,
glass shattering)
HARRIET: No! Ow!

09:20.360 --> 09:22.760
You feel good about your sex
joke earlier, Brian?

09:22.762 --> 09:25.463
He's savagely beating her again.
You hear that?

09:25.465 --> 09:26.564
Yeah, I'm not deaf.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.266
Oh, oh, what, like my brother?

09:28.268 --> 09:28.933
Boy, you have no class!

09:28.935 --> 09:30.835
MAN:
Yeah, that's the
guy's brother, man!

09:30.837 --> 09:33.671
HARRIET: Yeah!
Shut up, bitch!
(fist smacking)

09:36.775 --> 09:38.643
Hey, you know
what they say.

09:38.645 --> 09:40.711
See a broad,
to get that booty, yak 'em.

09:40.713 --> 09:43.948
QUAGMIRE & JEROME:
Leg her down and
smack 'em yak 'em!

09:43.950 --> 09:45.783
(laughs)
Cold got to be.

09:45.785 --> 09:47.552
(both laughing)

09:47.554 --> 09:49.287
Golly!
If you'll excuse me,

09:49.289 --> 09:51.355
I'm gonna order me
some cheap cognac

09:51.357 --> 09:53.624
and put it
in a fancy glass.

09:53.626 --> 09:54.825
Boy, Jerome
is the greatest.

09:54.827 --> 09:56.294
We really lucked out.

09:56.296 --> 09:57.361
I don't know, you guys.

09:57.363 --> 09:58.529
I'm not so sure
about Jerome.

09:58.531 --> 10:00.364
I mean, how do we know
we can really trust him?

10:00.366 --> 10:02.800
What are you talking about,
Peter? Jerome's awesome.

10:02.802 --> 10:04.835
Yeah, why the hell wouldn't
we be able to trust him?

10:04.837 --> 10:06.070
All right, you guys
want the truth?

10:06.072 --> 10:08.973
Before me and Lois were married,
our new friend

10:08.975 --> 10:10.841
used to slip her
the old Pringles can.

10:10.843 --> 10:14.278
Well, so what, Peter.
That was 20 years ago.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.379
That doesn't matter!

10:15.381 --> 10:17.315
Look, Peter,
Jerome's the coolest guy

10:17.317 --> 10:18.449
we've met since
Cleveland left.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.918
Yeah, don't do anything
to ruin this, Peter.

10:20.920 --> 10:23.254
You know, the way you
ruined my parrot.

10:23.256 --> 10:24.855
I just bought
it yesterday.

10:24.857 --> 10:25.790
Isn't it beautiful?

10:25.792 --> 10:28.159
Cripple, cripple, cripple,
cripple, cripple, cripple,

10:28.161 --> 10:29.894
cripple, cripple,
cripple, cripple.

10:29.896 --> 10:31.729
Cripple!
Damn it!

10:35.634 --> 10:36.701
That son of a bitch.

10:36.703 --> 10:38.903
Thinks he can sleep
with my wife!

10:38.905 --> 10:40.738
Not on my watch.

10:41.707 --> 10:44.609
ALEX KEATON (on TV):
Listen, I don't care that
you're dating Mallory.

10:44.611 --> 10:46.377
Nobody in this family
likes you, Nick.

10:46.379 --> 10:49.547
You just stand your ground,
garbage sculpture man.

10:49.549 --> 10:51.482
They'll come to respect you.

10:51.484 --> 10:52.550
You bastard.

10:52.552 --> 10:53.584
Nick was no good for her

10:53.586 --> 10:56.587
and it broke
Skippy Handleman's heart!

11:06.164 --> 11:08.966
Dear God and Black Jesus!

11:16.208 --> 11:17.775
Jerome? What, uh...

11:17.777 --> 11:19.143
What-what the hell
are you doing here?

11:19.145 --> 11:21.846
Oh, Peter, something
terrible has happened.

11:21.848 --> 11:24.815
Somebody burned down
Jerome's house last night.

11:24.817 --> 11:27.151
This whacked-out world.

11:27.153 --> 11:29.053
It just makes you want
to grab your nephew

11:29.055 --> 11:31.722
and get in a van and shoot
people in the D.C. area.

11:31.724 --> 11:34.025
Yeah, well, when I find
the guy who did it,

11:34.027 --> 11:37.928
I'm gonna rip his arms off and
do his wife in front of him.

11:37.930 --> 11:39.764
And no one would blame you.

11:39.766 --> 11:40.698
But, meanwhile, Jerome,

11:40.700 --> 11:42.833
you are more than
welcome to stay with us.

11:42.835 --> 11:43.934
What?

11:43.936 --> 11:45.202
Oh, well, thank
you, Lois.

11:45.204 --> 11:48.773
Man, I'm so lucky to have real
friends like you and Peter.

11:48.775 --> 11:50.441
Well, I guess
you can stay here.

11:50.443 --> 11:51.842
But I'll tell you
one thing...

11:51.844 --> 11:53.177
Oh, hang on a second.

11:53.179 --> 11:54.712
What is that?

11:54.714 --> 11:57.815
I don't know, it's trying
to do something.

11:57.817 --> 11:58.582
Oh...

11:58.584 --> 12:02.553
Well, well, I guess we're
just gonna have to wait.

12:07.159 --> 12:09.393
So how long is Jerome
gonna be staying with us, Dad?

12:09.395 --> 12:12.496
I don't know, Chris,
but the sooner he's out
of here, the better.

12:12.498 --> 12:14.598
I don't trust him around
Lois for a second.

12:14.600 --> 12:18.002
LOIS:
Oh, God, Jerome,
that is so good.

12:18.004 --> 12:21.672
Oh, yeah,
it's so hot and moist.

12:22.007 --> 12:25.609
Mmm, these scones
are delicious.

12:25.611 --> 12:28.479
You are quite the little baker,
Jerome.

12:28.481 --> 12:29.447
Oh, thank God.

12:29.449 --> 12:30.881
What's going on in here?!

12:30.883 --> 12:31.849
Relax, Mr. Furley.

12:31.851 --> 12:33.517
I thought what you
thought, but it's okay.

12:33.519 --> 12:36.187
Well, it sounded like...
I know, I know, but it's fine.

12:36.189 --> 12:37.755
Go back to being dead.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.023
Peter, is everything
all right?

12:39.025 --> 12:40.825
Yeah. Yeah, Lois.
Everything's fine.

12:40.827 --> 12:43.160
You guys, uh, having
a little breakfast?

12:43.162 --> 12:45.296
Yes, and Jerome
made scones.

12:45.298 --> 12:47.932
Would you like one?
Oh, they're delicious.

12:47.934 --> 12:51.135
I thought maybe later
today, we could all...

12:51.137 --> 12:53.070
(choking)

12:53.072 --> 12:55.206
Oh, my God!
Mom's choking!

12:55.208 --> 12:57.875
Out of the way.
I'm an EMT.

13:01.747 --> 13:03.114
Her airway's jammed.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.849
Come on, now.
Just like that.

13:04.851 --> 13:05.983
(both grunting)

13:05.985 --> 13:08.753
I need some
gravitational help.

13:09.588 --> 13:12.490
Oh, no, her clothes
are constricting!

13:12.492 --> 13:14.091
As are mine!

13:14.093 --> 13:16.660
(breathing heavily)

13:18.997 --> 13:20.231
(coughs)

13:20.233 --> 13:21.565
Oh, my God!

13:21.567 --> 13:23.834
Oh! Thank you, Jerome!

13:23.836 --> 13:25.069
You saved my life!

13:25.071 --> 13:27.838
"Um, I'll have
what she's having,"

13:27.840 --> 13:30.975
says the funniest person
in the room.

13:34.780 --> 13:36.814
Hey, what are you getting
all dressed up for?

13:36.816 --> 13:38.849
I'm treating Quagmire
to a night out.

13:38.851 --> 13:40.084
Really? I thought
he hated you.

13:40.086 --> 13:41.152
How'd you
convince him to go?

13:41.154 --> 13:42.686
I tricked him.
Sent him a phony card.

13:42.688 --> 13:45.556
He thinks he's going
on a date with an
old girlfriend.

13:45.558 --> 13:47.591
But instead,
you're going to show up.

13:47.593 --> 13:48.926
You got it.
Yikes.

13:48.928 --> 13:50.628
That's a recipe
for disappointment.

13:50.630 --> 13:52.196
Like walking
a floral arrangement

13:52.198 --> 13:54.665
through an office
full of fat women.

13:55.100 --> 13:57.067
Is there
a Miss...
(excited gasping)

13:57.069 --> 13:59.403
...es.
(all sighing)

14:03.708 --> 14:05.709
Brian?
Where's Cheryl Tiegs?

14:05.711 --> 14:06.710
Well, she's not coming.

14:06.712 --> 14:09.246
I wrote you that,
because I knew you'd
never come if it was me.

14:09.248 --> 14:12.383
But I planned a big
night and we're gonna
have a great time.

14:12.385 --> 14:14.985
Brian, Cheryl was the one
that got away.

14:14.987 --> 14:17.188
She was the great love
of my life.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.789
I thought this was my chance

14:18.791 --> 14:20.691
to finally achieve
some real happiness.

14:20.693 --> 14:23.027
Ever since she left,
I've been chasing girls

14:23.029 --> 14:25.729
to fill the hole she made
when she walked out.

14:25.731 --> 14:27.598
And now I'm forever lost.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.800
Well, I bet a thick,
juicy steak

14:29.802 --> 14:31.669
could help fill
that hole, huh?

14:31.671 --> 14:33.804
(sobbing)

14:34.906 --> 14:36.941
Aw, come on,
it'll be great.

14:36.943 --> 14:39.743
Listen, Glenn,
I-I want us to be friends.

14:39.745 --> 14:41.212
I think we could be
an even better team

14:41.214 --> 14:44.782
than Lewis and Clark
and The Guy Who Likes
To Rip Up Maps.

14:44.784 --> 14:48.219
All right,
the Northwest Passage.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.721
Hey, can I see that?

14:51.957 --> 14:53.123
Damn it! You ass!

14:53.125 --> 14:55.292
Easy, Clark.
I hate that guy!

14:55.294 --> 14:56.260
It's been a long trip.

14:56.262 --> 14:57.928
You're tired.
No! I hate him!

14:57.930 --> 15:00.297
Look, you're angry,
you're dehydrated.

15:00.299 --> 15:02.099
Just have some water
from the canteen

15:02.101 --> 15:04.101
and you'll feel better.
Okay.

15:04.103 --> 15:06.871
I just totally drowned
this anthill.

15:06.873 --> 15:09.974
Hey, when are we
going to get there?

15:13.578 --> 15:16.714
Oh, and this is Peter
and I at our wedding.

15:16.716 --> 15:18.048
Aw, you look beautiful.

15:18.050 --> 15:19.950
And he's a handsome
fella, ain't he?

15:19.952 --> 15:22.219
Well, I am ready
for my evening.

15:22.221 --> 15:23.087
Oh, my God, Peter!

15:23.089 --> 15:24.922
What the hell?!
Peter, what are you doing?

15:24.924 --> 15:27.892
Oh, surely, Jerome,
you don't want to stay
in the same house

15:27.894 --> 15:30.661
as a ghost who carries
a torch around.

15:30.663 --> 15:33.130
Ooh, fire ghost!

15:33.132 --> 15:34.031
Ooh! Ya scared yet?

15:34.033 --> 15:36.100
Didn't know this place
was haunted, did ya?

15:36.102 --> 15:37.368
Peter, take that
thing off!

15:37.370 --> 15:38.969
Hey, what the hell's
going on?

15:38.971 --> 15:40.170
I'll tell you
what's going on.

15:40.172 --> 15:41.872
I have had about
enough of you, Jerome.

15:41.874 --> 15:44.174
I know you want my wife,
but you can't have her!

15:44.176 --> 15:46.143
You are no longer
welcome in my house!

15:46.145 --> 15:48.078
Whatchu talkin' 'bout, Peter?
(laughs)

15:48.080 --> 15:49.280
But you can't have
sex with Lois!

15:49.282 --> 15:51.815
Now, I want you out
of here right now!

15:51.817 --> 15:53.951
I can't believe this.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.819
I thought I found
a true friend in you.

15:55.821 --> 15:59.990
I'd never do anything to hurt
you or your family.

15:59.992 --> 16:02.359
Man, you're breaking my heart.

16:02.361 --> 16:03.060
Jerome, wait.

16:03.062 --> 16:05.629
He doesn't know what
he's talking about.

16:05.631 --> 16:06.297
I'm sorry, Lois.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.899
I think it would be better
if I left.

16:08.901 --> 16:12.169
Peter, I'm sorry
if I caused you any trouble.

16:12.171 --> 16:16.006
I won't be bothering
you again.

16:17.609 --> 16:20.844
Wow, what just happened
was kind of sad.

16:20.846 --> 16:25.883
(hums Family Guy theme morosely)

16:35.660 --> 16:37.928
So... whose leg
do you have to hump

16:37.930 --> 16:39.463
to get a dry martini
around here?

16:39.465 --> 16:41.332
(chuckles)
Hmm.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.367
God, look at the size
of these steak knives.

16:43.369 --> 16:46.303
Wha-what are they serving us?
Tyrannosaurus Rex?

16:46.305 --> 16:48.372
Not likely.

16:48.374 --> 16:52.977
Hey, what if I just drank
this whole bottle of ketchup?

16:52.979 --> 16:54.778
Can you imagine?
You dare me?

16:54.780 --> 16:56.280
Kind of ruins it
for the next person

16:56.282 --> 16:58.115
who might want
some ketchup.

16:58.117 --> 16:59.416
So, how's
the flying business?

16:59.418 --> 17:02.386
Not so great.
The economy's sort
of taken its toll,

17:02.388 --> 17:05.222
lot of salary cuts,
lot of layoffs.
Yeah?

17:05.224 --> 17:06.390
That's pretty much it.

17:06.392 --> 17:08.993
I mean, you want to learn
more, read the papers,

17:08.995 --> 17:10.394
go on the Internet,
I-I don't know.

17:10.396 --> 17:11.895
Boy, that's got to be
an interesting job.

17:11.897 --> 17:14.164
I'll bet you got--
How do those things work?

17:14.166 --> 17:15.766
What? Planes?

17:15.768 --> 17:17.334
How does a plane work?
Yeah.

17:17.336 --> 17:21.038
You want me to sit here
and explain to you
how a plane works?

17:21.040 --> 17:22.239
I don't know. Yeah.

17:22.241 --> 17:23.374
You want to maybe just go?

17:23.376 --> 17:25.876
Quagmire, come on,
I'm really trying hard here.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.211
Who asked you to try hard?

17:27.213 --> 17:29.279
Nobody, but all--
I'm trying to establish

17:29.281 --> 17:30.314
a friendship with you.

17:30.316 --> 17:32.149
All I've done is try
to be nice to you,

17:32.151 --> 17:35.486
and you still don't like me.
How can you not like me?

17:35.488 --> 17:37.688
Okay. I'll tell you.

17:37.690 --> 17:39.556
You are the worst person I know.

17:39.558 --> 17:41.225
You constantly hit on your
best friend's wife.

17:41.227 --> 17:42.993
The man pays for your food
and rescued you

17:42.995 --> 17:44.795
from certain death,
and this is how you repay him?

17:44.797 --> 17:47.898
And to add insult to injury,
you defecate all over his yard.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.200
And you're such a sponge.
You pay for nothing.

17:50.202 --> 17:52.136
You always say,
"Oh, I'll get you later."

17:52.138 --> 17:53.103
But later never comes.

17:53.105 --> 17:54.805
And what really bothers me,
is you pretend

17:54.807 --> 17:57.408
you're this deep guy who loves
women for their souls

17:57.410 --> 17:59.076
when all you do is date bimbos.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.477
Yeah, I date women
for their bodies,

18:00.479 --> 18:01.979
but at least
I'm honest about it.

18:01.981 --> 18:03.514
I don't buy them a copy
of <i>Catcher in the Rye</i>

18:03.516 --> 18:06.050
and then lecture them with some
seventh grade interpretation

18:06.052 --> 18:09.053
of how Holden Caulfield
is some profound, intellectual.

18:09.055 --> 18:10.888
He wasn't.
He was a spoiled brat.

18:10.890 --> 18:13.157
And that's why you like him
so much-- he's you.

18:13.159 --> 18:14.024
God, you're pretentious!

18:14.026 --> 18:15.859
And you delude yourself
by thinking you're some

18:15.861 --> 18:17.227
great writer,
even though you're terrible.

18:17.229 --> 18:19.063
You know, I should have known
Cheryl Tiegs

18:19.065 --> 18:20.097
didn't write me that note.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.299
She would have known there's no
"A" in the word "definite."

18:22.301 --> 18:24.134
And I think
what I hate most about you

18:24.136 --> 18:26.537
is your textbook liberal agenda,
how we should

18:26.539 --> 18:27.905
"legalize pot, man,"

18:27.907 --> 18:29.506
how big business
is crushing the underclass,

18:29.508 --> 18:32.176
how homelessness is the biggest
tragedy in America.

18:32.178 --> 18:33.310
Well, what have you done
to help?

18:33.312 --> 18:35.279
I work down at the soup kitchen,
Brian.

18:35.281 --> 18:36.380
Never seen you down there.

18:36.382 --> 18:37.481
You want to help?
Grab a ladle!

18:37.483 --> 18:40.984
And, by the way, driving a Prius
doesn't make you Jesus Christ.

18:40.986 --> 18:43.120
Oh, wait, you don't believe
in Jesus Christ,

18:43.122 --> 18:44.221
or any religion for that matter,

18:44.223 --> 18:45.556
because "religion is
for idiots."

18:45.558 --> 18:48.125
Well, who the hell are you
to talk down to anyone?

18:48.127 --> 18:49.059
You failed college twice.

18:49.061 --> 18:51.295
Which isn't nearly as bad
as your failure as a father.

18:51.297 --> 18:52.930
How's that son of yours
you never see?

18:52.932 --> 18:55.032
But you know what?
I could forgive all of that,

18:55.034 --> 18:58.202
all of it,
if you weren't such a bore.

18:58.204 --> 18:59.203
That's the worst of it, Brian.

18:59.205 --> 19:03.874
You're just a big, sad,
alcoholic bore.

19:03.876 --> 19:05.242
(exhales)

19:05.244 --> 19:06.243
Well, see ya, Brian.

19:06.245 --> 19:08.846
Thanks for the
(bleep) steak.

19:12.517 --> 19:13.350
Boy, it sure is nice

19:13.352 --> 19:16.153
having our house
to ourselves again, huh?

19:16.888 --> 19:17.187
Lois?

19:17.189 --> 19:20.390
Peter, sometimes you just make
me sick to my stomach.

19:20.392 --> 19:23.393
Look, I know you
think Jerome was
a good guy, but...

19:23.395 --> 19:25.295
No, he <i>was</i>
<i>a good guy, Peter.</i>

19:25.297 --> 19:26.363
And I'm gonna
prove it to you.

19:26.365 --> 19:29.867
And you're gonna feel
like a real jackass.

19:29.869 --> 19:31.034
What's that?

19:31.036 --> 19:32.603
It's a gift.
For you.

19:32.605 --> 19:34.538
You don't deserve it,
but if anything,

19:34.540 --> 19:36.173
it's gonna wake you up
a little bit.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.242
Jerome got you this
as a thank you

19:38.244 --> 19:40.377
for letting him stay here.

19:40.379 --> 19:43.080
It's an actual prop
from <i>Family Ties.</i>

19:43.082 --> 19:47.151
This is... this is one
of Nick's garbage sculptures.

19:47.153 --> 19:49.186
Yeah. Pretty thoughtful,
isn't it?

19:49.188 --> 19:52.422
Oh, boy, do I feel like
a jackass.

19:52.424 --> 19:54.391
Lois, I'm sorry.
I just...

19:54.393 --> 19:56.994
I let my jealousy
get the best of me.

19:56.996 --> 19:58.695
Jerome's such
a cool guy and I,

19:58.697 --> 20:00.497
I guess I was worried
he was cool enough

20:00.499 --> 20:01.698
to steal you away from me.

20:01.700 --> 20:04.001
You should know better
than that, Peter.

20:04.003 --> 20:07.004
Now, I think you have
an apology to make.

20:16.114 --> 20:19.950
Hey, you look like
you could use a pal.

20:19.952 --> 20:21.285
Oh. Hi, Peter.

20:21.287 --> 20:24.655
Look, I'm sorry
about how I acted.

20:24.657 --> 20:25.756
It's just...

20:25.758 --> 20:27.257
Lois means
everything to me.

20:27.259 --> 20:28.358
And when I saw
you together,

20:28.360 --> 20:30.194
I-I didn't know what
was gonna happen.

20:30.196 --> 20:32.496
I just thought you might
try to mount her

20:32.498 --> 20:34.164
or whatever it is
you guys do.

20:34.166 --> 20:36.400
Peter, how could you
even think that?

20:36.402 --> 20:38.969
I would never do
anything like that to you.

20:38.971 --> 20:41.271
You were my boy.
We were like family.

20:41.273 --> 20:42.940
Yeah, I know.

20:42.942 --> 20:44.208
I messed up bad.

20:44.210 --> 20:46.276
I'm really sorry, Jerome.

20:48.613 --> 20:50.180
We cool, Peter. We cool.

20:50.182 --> 20:53.350
But, listen, there is
something I got to fess up to.

20:53.352 --> 20:55.052
While I was living
with y'all,

20:55.054 --> 20:58.422
I had myself lots of
nasty ass sex with Meg.

20:58.424 --> 21:01.091
I don't care about that.

21:06.798 --> 21:08.432
Hey, Brian, how'd it go?

21:08.434 --> 21:09.299
Fine.

21:09.301 --> 21:11.001
Wha-- have you been crying?

21:11.003 --> 21:11.602
What happened?

21:11.604 --> 21:14.137
It didn't work.
He still hates me.

21:14.139 --> 21:15.539
You want to know something?

21:15.541 --> 21:16.473
That's okay.

21:16.475 --> 21:17.741
You don't need Quagmire
to like you.

21:17.743 --> 21:22.145
You only need one person to like
you and that person is you.

21:22.147 --> 21:25.282
And I'll tell you something
else, I like you.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.316
Thanks.

21:26.318 --> 21:28.185
You want to sleep
in my room?

21:28.187 --> 21:30.053
Yeah, that'd be nice.

21:31.823 --> 21:34.558
Good night, Brian.
Good night, Stewie.

21:37.095 --> 21:38.395
(loud wet fart)

21:38.397 --> 21:42.566
STEWIE:
Oh, come on, man.
