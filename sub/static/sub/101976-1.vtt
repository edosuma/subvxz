send it to you.

18:12.459 --> 18:13.895
I'm gonna use
your half of your money

18:13.928 --> 18:15.830
and act like I'm spending money
on your daughter.

18:15.863 --> 18:17.899
We out here livin' our best life

18:17.932 --> 18:19.634
while you stuck in prison,
bitch.

18:19.667 --> 18:23.136
I always did like your wife.
Redbone with a fat ass.

18:23.170 --> 18:25.807
I'm going over there tonight.
I already talked to Little Mike.

18:25.840 --> 18:28.275
His dumb ass is always runnin'
the streets.

18:28.308 --> 18:30.310
I told your wife
about Mosirah, too.

18:30.344 --> 18:31.879
You fuckin' cheater.

18:31.913 --> 18:34.314
I was over there last night
watching TV on your couch.

18:34.348 --> 18:36.818
I had some thin white
sweatpants on with no drawers.

18:36.851 --> 18:38.786
Your wife and daughter
was looking at my prick,

18:38.820 --> 18:40.855
and I accidentally...
quote, quote...

18:40.888 --> 18:42.690
spilled water right on my prick.

18:42.724 --> 18:45.526
And P.S... Your daughter
18th birthday next week.

18:45.560 --> 18:47.595
I'm about to spoil
her little thick ass.

18:47.629 --> 18:49.931
I guess you know now that
the street-love shit is fake.

18:49.964 --> 18:51.532
No money and no visits.

18:51.566 --> 18:54.301
Your ass gonna be cut up
when you get out there.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.571
And don't drop the soap.
No nut, bitch.

18:56.604 --> 18:57.772
And I'm retired, too.

18:57.805 --> 18:59.439
I can't risk getting locked up

18:59.473 --> 19:01.609
and lose what I got going on
with my new family, man.

19:01.643 --> 19:03.410
And if I get locked up,
I'm tellin'.

19:03.443 --> 19:05.379
So I'll get right back to it.

19:05.412 --> 19:06.581
Salakum.

19:06.614 --> 19:08.415
Oh, my God.

19:08.448 --> 19:10.317
I knew I shouldn't have fucked
his wife.

19:10.350 --> 19:13.186
Man, just do what I told you.
On some nut-ass shit.

19:13.220 --> 19:16.223
I'm sorry, Mike!

19:17.257 --> 19:18.693
Yo, we gonna talk!

Hey, yo.

20:00.802 --> 20:02.603
You're like a little-ass boy,

Man, everybody says that,

Yo. They call me Boone.

20:08.943 --> 20:11.311

20:11.344 --> 20:13.380
And look. I know the C.O.s
bring you in this way.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.016
But this my fuckin' area.

When you want to get in
your bed,

20:16.617 --> 20:18.920

20:18.953 --> 20:20.788
So I can't come in right here?

20:20.822 --> 20:22.023
What the fuck?
You can't comprehend?

20:22.056 --> 20:23.390

20:24.092 --> 20:28.361
Commissary day, all sweets,

Alter your fuckin' tone, man,

20:30.330 --> 20:32.365

your fuckin' beak off.

20:32.399 --> 20:35.503
Bitch-ass nigga.

20:35.536 --> 20:36.938

Alright, then.

But I don't fuck with snacks

21:30.124 --> 21:31.491

21:33.426 --> 21:36.731
But now they fuck with your body

Plus, look at my teeth.

I hit that boul. Yep.

26:29.657 --> 26:31.325
Why you looking at me like that,
Rich?

26:31.358 --> 26:33.327
You gonna say something?

26:33.360 --> 26:35.396
You can't talk?

26:35.429 --> 26:37.231
Damn. Your jaw broke.

26:37.264 --> 26:39.100
Rich, I don't think
you understand.

26:39.133 --> 26:41.001
You might got
a fuckin' concussion.

26:42.436 --> 26:44.305
Fuck. Fucked my boul up.

26:46.040 --> 26:47.875
Nurse!

26:47.908 --> 26:49.110
Look at this shit, man.

26:49.143 --> 26:50.711
You got me all fucked up
in here, man.

26:50.744 --> 26:53.114
- Look at this shit, man.
- I got fucked up, too!

26:53.147 --> 26:54.949
Sitting here
looking like a fuckin' lame.

26:54.982 --> 26:57.051
My eyes and shit
are all fucked up, man.

26:57.084 --> 26:58.652
Rich, I got fucked up, too!

26:58.686 --> 27:00.254
Man, you got to stop
that clown shit, man.

27:00.287 --> 27:01.989
Stop fuckin' playing, man.

27:02.022 --> 27:04.225
You keep getting me fucked up.
Shut up, man!

27:04.258 --> 27:05.426
We got fucked up together!

27:05.459 --> 27:06.894
Damn!

27:06.927 --> 27:08.796
Shit, you was knocked
the fuck out!

27:08.829 --> 27:10.798
You ain't know what happened.
I... Like, I helped you.

27:10.831 --> 27:12.266
Man, you ain't do shit, man.

27:12.299 --> 27:14.101
Man, how you know?
You was knocked the fuck out.

27:14.135 --> 27:16.370
'Cause I know you, man.
The fuck...

27:16.403 --> 27:18.239
Damn, man!

27:18.272 --> 27:20.307
You ain't even know!
You was asleep!

27:20.341 --> 27:22.109
Like, you was really asleep!

27:22.143 --> 27:24.345
That boul hit the shit out you,
man.

27:24.378 --> 27:26.213
Like, I ain't lying.

27:26.247 --> 27:28.849
That boul knocked you the fuck
out, and I-I hit that boul.

27:28.883 --> 27:31.418
Boy's all heat.

27:41.462 --> 27:43.831
You just woke up.

27:43.864 --> 27:45.866
It fucked me up.

27:45.900 --> 27:48.836
In my 22 years
of being a warden...

27:48.869 --> 27:51.238
and a damn good warden,
I must say...

27:51.272 --> 27:53.807
I ain't never, ever...

27:53.841 --> 27:57.077
on God's blue earth ever seen...

27:57.111 --> 27:58.312
Sir. Sir.

27:58.345 --> 28:00.147
- What is it?!
- Green.

28:00.181 --> 28:01.715
Green what?

28:01.749 --> 28:04.919
No disrespect,
but the earth is green.

28:04.952 --> 28:06.954
- The earth is blue!
- No.

28:06.987 --> 28:09.757
My dad said that the earth
was filled with green trees

28:09.790 --> 28:11.792
and green money rule the world.

28:11.825 --> 28:12.993
So the earth is green.

28:13.027 --> 28:14.895
Your daddy?

28:14.929 --> 28:17.998
Boy, I don't care
what your daddy told you!

28:18.032 --> 28:19.867
This earth is surrounded
by blue water,

28:19.900 --> 28:21.735
so the earth is blue.

28:21.769 --> 28:23.505
- Do you understand?!
- But it's...

28:23.538 --> 28:27.474
Yo, just shut up, man.
Shut up, yo!

28:27.509 --> 28:28.909
Damn.

28:28.943 --> 28:32.479
You two have been
in so much shit

28:32.514 --> 28:36.250
within the last six hours
that you've been in my house!

28:36.283 --> 28:41.121
If I ever hear another...
and I mean another...

28:41.155 --> 28:45.359
motherfuckin' word
about you being into something,

28:45.392 --> 28:49.063
I'll put you two in the chair
my goddamn self!

28:49.096 --> 28:50.998
Jackson, get them cleaned up

28:51.031 --> 28:53.467
and get their ass back
to population!

28:53.500 --> 28:54.868
I'm hurt too.

28:54.902 --> 28:56.971
Come on! Let's go!

28:57.905 --> 28:59.807
Quit turning your head.

28:59.840 --> 29:01.842
Gate.

29:09.950 --> 29:12.019
The fuck?

29:27.234 --> 29:29.136
- Hello?
- Yeah. Jimmy.

29:29.169 --> 29:31.171
It's me, the warden.

29:31.205 --> 29:32.540
Hey. Look here.

29:32.574 --> 29:35.476
I don't know what's going on
in this prison,

29:35.510 --> 29:37.211
but I'm not liking it.

29:37.244 --> 29:38.979
And that Mike character?

29:39.013 --> 29:41.048
You keep him on the other side.

29:41.081 --> 29:43.017
I don't want them here
with everybody else.

29:43.050 --> 29:44.985
Keep me out of it.

29:45.019 --> 29:46.186
Yeah.

29:46.220 --> 29:48.088
And those two cop killers?

29:48.122 --> 29:50.491
The next time you go out
on that labor detail,

29:50.525 --> 29:52.226
you put their asses to work.

29:52.259 --> 29:53.595
- You understand me?
- I hear you, buddy.

29:53.628 --> 29:55.029
I want to see them sweating

29:55.062 --> 29:57.164
the next time I see them
in this prison.

29:57.197 --> 29:59.433
I don't like cop killers.

29:59.466 --> 30:01.068
- Yeah. You take care of that.
- Will do.

30:01.101 --> 30:02.936
Immediately.

30:02.970 --> 30:05.272
- Thank you.
- Over and out.

30:05.306 --> 30:07.041
We got one on!

30:07.074 --> 30:09.176
We got a special request
from the warden

30:09.209 --> 30:11.412
to bring
the two cop killers back.

30:11.445 --> 30:14.481
Four in. Bringing four back.
Out in five.

31:25.386 --> 31:27.555

31:38.533 --> 31:40.067
Now, which way are we going?

31:40.100 --> 31:41.468
What do you mean,
which way are we going?

31:41.503 --> 31:42.670
- Which way we gonna go?
- I thought you knew.

31:42.704 --> 31:44.171
Motherfucker, you ran first.

31:44.204 --> 31:45.406
Come on!

31:45.439 --> 31:47.174
Come on, man!
What the fuck, man?

31:47.207 --> 31:49.076
I don't know this shit.

31:49.109 --> 31:51.679
Yo, I think if we go
over this way,

31:51.713 --> 31:53.548
there's another way we can go.

31:53.581 --> 31:57.017
Like, it's another whole,
like...

31:57.050 --> 31:59.521
What the fuck?

31:59.554 --> 32:00.988
What's up, man?

32:01.021 --> 32:02.356
What the hell is going on
back here?

32:02.389 --> 32:04.091
Well, you know, man,
I'm just gonna see.

32:04.124 --> 32:07.127
You know, back in the 1800s,
man, the ghetto birds war,

32:07.161 --> 32:08.663
you know what I mean,
it was shot in Pennsylvania

32:08.696 --> 32:10.097
right here on this spot.

32:10.130 --> 32:11.465
You know, our
great-great-grandfathers

32:11.498 --> 32:12.667
and everything...

32:12.700 --> 32:14.101
Cut the shit, man.

32:14.134 --> 32:15.570
What are you doing back here?

32:15.603 --> 32:17.204
Well, I really wanted
to take a shit, man.

32:17.237 --> 32:19.039
I ain't want to shit
right in front of everybody.

32:19.072 --> 32:20.742
- You want to take a shit, huh?
- Yeah.

32:20.775 --> 32:22.710
Take a shit.

32:22.744 --> 32:25.312
- Like, right here?
- Right here. Take a shit.

32:25.345 --> 32:27.047
Kind of hard to come out, man.

32:27.080 --> 32:29.082
I don't give a fuck.

32:29.116 --> 32:31.619
Sometimes you got to spread
your cheeks a little bit.

32:31.653 --> 32:33.387
Got a little...

32:33.420 --> 32:35.255
I drunk some prune juice.

32:35.289 --> 32:37.559
Man, stop talking to me
while you're taking a shit.

32:47.201 --> 32:48.770
You got some tissue?

32:48.803 --> 32:50.772
Use a leaf.

32:50.805 --> 32:53.273
I ain't wiping
this dirty leaf on my ass, man.

32:53.307 --> 32:55.175
Sound like a personal problem.

32:55.209 --> 32:56.744
I'll just use my shirt.

33:00.648 --> 33:02.249
Shit.

33:05.419 --> 33:06.721
I don't need your shirt.

33:13.595 --> 33:15.229
Hey, Rich?

33:15.262 --> 33:18.733
Word on the pound is y'all
niggas killed some cop.

33:18.766 --> 33:20.200
What's up with that?

33:20.234 --> 33:22.436
No disrespect, bro,

33:22.469 --> 33:23.671
we still rumbling.

33:23.705 --> 33:25.472
I don't like
talking about our case.

33:25.507 --> 33:27.107
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

33:27.140 --> 33:28.342
Don't be rude, Rich.

33:28.375 --> 33:29.544
They want to know, like,
what happened.

33:29.577 --> 33:30.745
Don't you want to hear
the story?

33:30.778 --> 33:32.446
Yeah.

33:32.479 --> 33:34.114
- Y'all want to hear the story?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:34.147 --> 33:36.618
Come around, then, man.
You want to hear the story?

33:36.651 --> 33:38.452
- Come around.
- What you waiting for, nigga?

33:38.485 --> 33:40.187
I been wanting to know that.

33:40.220 --> 33:42.624
This motherfucking cop
came busting up in my house

33:42.657 --> 33:44.358
like he fucking belonged there.

33:44.391 --> 33:46.426
I said, "Nigga, who the fuck
are you?!"

33:46.460 --> 33:48.495
I was ready to hit
that motherfucker.

33:48.530 --> 33:49.797
You know I'm not afraid.

33:49.831 --> 33:51.633
- Right, yeah.
- Yeah.

33:51.666 --> 33:53.133
Pow! Shot!

33:53.166 --> 33:54.334
Smoked a cop!

33:56.236 --> 33:58.840
Motherfucker,
187 on an undercover cop!

33:58.873 --> 34:02.309
Nigga, you the real MVP. Nice!

34:02.342 --> 34:03.645
I'm telling you. Straight up.

34:06.113 --> 34:07.582
Hey, yo, dog, tell the story.

34:07.615 --> 34:11.251
If you gonna tell a story,
you got to tell it right!

34:14.889 --> 34:18.860
So, my mom was in the kitchen,
cooking potato salad.

34:18.893 --> 34:20.393
What?!

34:20.427 --> 34:22.329
See, where we're from,
down 39th Street,

34:22.362 --> 34:24.565
we used to the gunfire.

34:26.132 --> 34:27.635
Pow! Pow!

34:27.668 --> 34:29.369
So when that second motherfucker
came in,

34:29.402 --> 34:31.237
I shot his ass too!

34:31.271 --> 34:34.107
- Pow!
- Damn!

34:34.141 --> 34:36.310
But as I looked over
at my main man, Rich,

34:36.342 --> 34:38.846
he was doing
just as he's doing right now.

34:38.880 --> 34:41.815
- This motherfucker was chillin'!
- Chillin'?

34:41.849 --> 34:44.418
This motherfucker was chillin'
in the motherfucking corner,

34:44.451 --> 34:46.654
rolling a motherfucking L.

34:46.688 --> 34:48.355
And my other homie said,

34:48.388 --> 34:51.458
"God damn, Boone, you shot
a motherfucking cop!"

34:51.491 --> 34:53.561
And you know what my main man,
Rich, said?!

34:53.594 --> 34:55.462
- What did he say?
- What did he say?

34:55.495 --> 34:57.732
"No, that shit was cool, bro.

34:57.765 --> 34:59.266
He came in the house.

34:59.299 --> 35:01.501
I mean, he did
what he had to do."

35:01.536 --> 35:03.403
Just like that,
right in the middle

35:03.437 --> 35:04.772
of the motherfucking gunfight!

35:04.806 --> 35:06.708
That's why I walk
with this nigga!

35:11.211 --> 35:12.680
He like to be a little,
you know what I'm saying,

35:12.714 --> 35:14.214
he don't like to be all loud
and all that.

35:14.247 --> 35:15.415
But I said,
"Man, we got to handle

35:15.449 --> 35:16.851
our motherfucking business."

35:16.884 --> 35:18.786
So the motherfucker backed up,
started coming in.

35:18.820 --> 35:20.187
I start
shooting motherfuckers!

35:20.220 --> 35:21.689
I'm all over
the motherfucking place.

35:21.723 --> 35:25.627
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!

35:28.830 --> 35:30.865
"Killed him, Mom."
Know what she said?

35:30.898 --> 35:32.533
'Cause my first name
is Maurquis.

35:32.567 --> 35:34.602
- What she say?
- "Go, Maurquis!"

35:34.636 --> 35:36.269
- Go, Maurquis!
- Go, Maurquis!

35:36.303 --> 35:37.939
- Go, Maurquis!
- Go, Maurquis!

35:37.972 --> 35:40.508
You know what I said
to the motherfucking police?!

35:40.541 --> 35:42.242
- What?
- What?

35:42.275 --> 35:43.443
You know what I said
to the motherfucking police?!

35:43.477 --> 35:44.646
What you say?!

35:44.679 --> 35:46.748
I said,
"911 is a joke in your town!"

35:46.781 --> 35:48.950
♪ Get up, a-get-get get down ♪

35:48.983 --> 35:51.385
♪ 911 is a joke in your town ♪

35:51.418 --> 35:53.621
♪ Get up, a-get-get get down ♪

35:53.655 --> 35:56.390
♪ 911 is a joke in your town ♪

35:56.423 --> 35:58.726
That's some
dumb-ass shit, man.

Fuck that.

44:36.377 --> 44:37.978

44:38.012 --> 44:39.313
Like, me, I speak

44:39.346 --> 44:41.248
No, ain't everybody
ain't for everybody.

44:45.753 --> 44:47.021
Maybe got the Kangol

44:47.054 --> 44:48.255
but I still

44:48.289 --> 44:49.723
Hold on, hold on.

44:49.757 --> 44:50.991
That's the nigga

45:05.873 --> 45:07.808
You fucked my wife, nigga.

45:07.841 --> 45:09.176

45:09.210 --> 45:11.412
Wait a minute.

45:11.445 --> 45:12.947

45:12.980 --> 45:14.181

45:29.063 --> 45:32.266
Man, that shit hurt.

45:32.299 --> 45:34.034
Like, we supposed to be
best friends, man.

45:34.068 --> 45:36.036
- You fucked my wife, man.
- Like, I'm sorry.

45:36.070 --> 45:38.973
I swear I will never do nothing
to your wife again.

45:39.006 --> 45:40.407
I'm not gonna
call her no more.

45:40.441 --> 45:43.010
Nothing, man. Nothing. I swear.

45:43.043 --> 45:44.245

46:03.264 --> 46:06.267
Yeah, but I stayed home.

46:06.300 --> 46:08.035
You sure you're not

46:08.068 --> 46:10.538
I swear to God, I ain't talked
to my wife in so long.

46:10.572 --> 46:12.206

46:19.113 --> 46:20.981
'cause you need to be
with your family."

46:21.015 --> 46:23.585
And he chose what he chose,
and now he locked the fuck up,

46:23.618 --> 46:26.120

47:47.134 --> 47:49.370
I put in a request to go
to the law library, man.

47:49.403 --> 47:51.573
There's too many loopholes
in this case, man.

47:51.606 --> 47:53.240
I'm not just waiting
for no lawyer.

47:53.273 --> 47:55.309
Fuck that.
I'm doing my own research.

47:55.342 --> 47:56.578
Why don't you just tell them
you did it

47:56.611 --> 47:58.145
so I can get the hell
out of here, man?

47:58.178 --> 47:59.514
They'll let me out tomorrow.

47:59.547 --> 48:01.281

48:06.253 --> 48:08.155
Man, that's different.
Like, I won't do that.

48:08.188 --> 48:10.592
What makes you think I would do
something like that to you, man?

48:10.625 --> 48:12.292
Look, man,
I'm not pleading guilty

48:12.326 --> 48:13.628

48:13.661 --> 48:15.362
We didn't even do shit.
What, you forgot?

48:15.396 --> 48:17.498
Man, we killed a cop dog, man.

48:17.532 --> 48:19.199
It's either

48:19.233 --> 48:21.301
or Mike will wind up
killing me here, man.

48:21.335 --> 48:22.570
Man, Mike ain't gonna do shit.

48:22.604 --> 48:24.238
I'm gonna holler

48:24.271 --> 48:25.707
Stop worrying about Mike, man.

48:25.740 --> 48:27.441
We need to worry about
fighting these charges.

48:27.474 --> 48:28.643

Oh, no, I'm not...

55:07.440 --> 55:09.442
Oh, yes.

55:09.476 --> 55:11.078
You need some help

Hmm?
Fuck you mean, "everybody"?

56:47.675 --> 56:49.143
What you talking about?

56:49.176 --> 56:51.078
Boone was on Live
the whole time.

56:51.112 --> 56:52.613
Even got the cop on there saying

56:52.647 --> 56:54.181
that he was gonna doctor up
the evidence

56:54.215 --> 56:56.449

56:59.520 --> 57:02.757

57:06.661 --> 57:07.929
Go down to 39th Street.

57:07.962 --> 57:09.730
- You know Boone's brother Reese?
- Yeah.

57:09.764 --> 57:11.632
He on the run right now
for this shit,

57:11.666 --> 57:13.701
so he might not be out there,
but...

57:13.734 --> 57:15.636
Go holler at Reese.

57:15.670 --> 57:18.706
Get that phone from Reese,
and take it to the lawyer.

57:18.739 --> 57:20.241
That shit
can get us out of here.

57:20.274 --> 57:21.943
Alright, well, when you want me
to take it to the lawyer?

57:21.976 --> 57:24.045
I got to go take him some
more money this week anyway.

57:24.078 --> 57:28.015
Fuck this week.

57:28.049 --> 57:30.084
Like, that can really

57:30.117 --> 57:32.119
You need to go

57:32.153 --> 57:35.022
Boone about to get us killed
in here any day.

57:35.056 --> 57:38.491
I got to get out of here, baby.
Go get that phone.

57:38.526 --> 57:39.694
Hey, Harris, what'd I say?
You know the rules.

57:39.727 --> 57:40.895
No more kissing and touching

57:40.928 --> 57:42.495
till the visit is over,
alright?

57:42.530 --> 57:44.265
You said we can kiss
right after the visit.

57:44.298 --> 57:45.766
Is the visit over?

57:45.800 --> 57:47.168
Yeah, I'm ending my visit
right now.

57:47.201 --> 57:48.736
Let's go, then. Wrap it up.

57:48.769 --> 57:51.872
- Go get that phone.
- I got you. I got you.

58:01.649 --> 58:03.751
<i>Well, the Department
of Homeland Security</i>

58:03.784 --> 58:06.687
<i>says it's looking at potential
new threats against the U.S.</i>

58:06.721 --> 58:08.222
You ain't gonna believe what E
just told me on her visit.

58:08.255 --> 58:09.623
What'd she say?

58:13.728 --> 58:15.696
The police issued
a search warrant

58:15.730 --> 58:17.031
on Boone's residence,

58:17.064 --> 58:19.100
located in
the West Philadelphia section.

58:19.133 --> 58:21.702
The actual search warrant
was not intended for Boone,

58:21.736 --> 58:23.571
<i>it was intended for a sibling</i>

58:23.604 --> 58:26.007
<i>who managed to escape from
a window and fled on foot.</i>

58:26.040 --> 58:27.908
<i>Reports are also suggesting
that the rappers</i>

58:27.942 --> 58:30.144
gave a K-9 dog oxycodone pills,

58:30.177 --> 58:32.780
famously known on the streets
as "percs."

58:32.813 --> 58:34.982
Thought you killed a cop.

58:37.251 --> 58:38.886
Nigga, what the fuck?!

58:38.919 --> 58:41.756
You didn't say anything?!

58:41.789 --> 58:44.658
You done killed a fucking dog?!
You done killed fucking Lassie?!

59:04.879 --> 59:06.680
<i>I told this stupid nigga</i>

59:06.714 --> 59:09.283
<i>stop telling everybody
we killed the cop.</i>

59:09.316 --> 59:11.052
<i>We killed the cop dog.</i>

59:11.085 --> 59:12.987
You hyena-looking
motherfucker!

59:13.020 --> 59:14.688
<i>We didn't even do</i> that <i>shit.</i>

59:17.158 --> 59:18.993
What do you mean?
I just talked to him yesterday.

59:19.026 --> 59:20.928
What do you mean
my brother died?

59:20.961 --> 59:22.630
God damn, bitch!

59:22.663 --> 59:23.831
Why... Why it take you that long
to answer the phone?

59:23.864 --> 59:25.366
Oh, hey,
like, back the fuck up.

59:25.399 --> 59:27.601
We can go right now, 'cause I'll
knock you the fuck out.

59:27.635 --> 59:29.336
Tch-tch-tch! Boy!

59:29.370 --> 59:31.272
Hello? Hey, what's going on?

59:31.305 --> 59:32.673
We have all the time
in the day.

59:32.706 --> 59:33.974
Yo, I was trying to tell you

59:34.008 --> 59:35.709
before that dumb-ass shit
happened, man.

59:35.743 --> 59:38.079
Guess what.
We got the whole shit on Live.

59:38.112 --> 59:39.713
Your phone was recording,

59:39.747 --> 59:41.215

dumb-ass shit and all that.

59:41.248 --> 59:44.051
Like, we're getting the fuck
out of here, man.

59:44.085 --> 59:46.087
And what is Rudy doing
up there?

59:46.120 --> 59:50.091
Your shit was recording live.
E got the phone.

59:50.124 --> 59:51.292
She's going to get it
from Reese

59:51.325 --> 59:52.760
and take it to the lawyer
right now.

59:52.793 --> 59:54.028
That's what I was
trying to tell you.

59:54.061 --> 59:55.396
She got the phone already?

59:55.429 --> 59:56.797
Why you doing that bullshit
like that?

59:56.831 --> 59:58.332
Come on, baby, come on.

59:58.365 --> 01:00:00.234
Like, I'm about to come home,
baby, like, come on.

01:00:00.267 --> 01:00:02.103
I put in these motions.
I put in these motions.

01:00:02.136 --> 01:00:03.370
I'm swear to God,
I'm coming home.

01:00:03.404 --> 01:00:05.773
I put in these motions.

01:00:05.806 --> 01:00:08.275
Babe, come on, don't do this
to me right now, B.

01:00:08.309 --> 01:00:10.778
Please, not right now.
No. No!

01:00:10.811 --> 01:00:12.880
I didn't... I didn't do nothing!

01:00:12.913 --> 01:00:14.148
She gone. I don't know.

01:00:14.181 --> 01:00:15.950
I got to call her to see
if she got it.

01:00:15.983 --> 01:00:18.052
She supposed to be going to
get it from Reese.

01:00:18.085 --> 01:00:20.921
What's up? You get the phone?
You get the phone?

01:00:20.955 --> 01:00:23.724
Oh, yeah, you got it?

01:00:23.757 --> 01:00:25.059
Hey, Rich, this boy keep on

01:00:25.092 --> 01:00:26.927
hanging up the phone
and using it again.

01:00:26.961 --> 01:00:28.295
Chill, chill, chill. For real?

01:00:28.329 --> 01:00:29.930
Yeah, take it to the lawyer.

01:00:29.964 --> 01:00:31.932
- Yo, she needs your code.
- Hmm?

01:00:31.966 --> 01:00:33.901
She need the code to the phone
to give to the lawyer so...

01:00:33.934 --> 01:00:35.402
I can't give her
my code, Rich.

01:00:35.436 --> 01:00:37.138
Look, stop fucking playing,

01:00:37.171 --> 01:00:38.906

I understand the situation,
but she can't get my code.

01:00:44.812 --> 01:00:46.180
Oh, my fucking God.

01:00:46.213 --> 01:00:47.815
Tell her that she can bring
the phone up here.

01:00:47.848 --> 01:00:49.416
Yo, this shit's saying

01:00:49.450 --> 01:00:51.252
You got to hang up

01:00:52.953 --> 01:00:55.389
I'm gonna call you

01:00:55.422 --> 01:00:57.725
What the fuck

01:00:57.758 --> 01:00:59.393
Don't you want to get

He says you can't.
She said she heard you.

01:01:14.341 --> 01:01:15.843
She ain't gonna say nothing.
It's cool.

01:01:15.876 --> 01:01:17.311

Just tell her the code.
You ain't got to say all that.

01:01:24.084 --> 01:01:25.486
Why you say it out loud, Rich?

01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:27.221

01:10:05.573 --> 01:10:07.842
'Cause if you don't,
you ain't never leaving here.

01:10:07.875 --> 01:10:10.845
You gonna be here
with me forever.

01:10:10.878 --> 01:10:12.446
We understand each other?

01:10:12.479 --> 01:10:14.982
Yeah, I want to cry right now,
but I can't.

01:10:15.016 --> 01:10:17.518
I understand.

01:10:17.552 --> 01:10:19.921
You need anything
to make this happen?

01:10:21.055 --> 01:10:23.658
Yeah, I-I do need Rich
to be the coach.

01:10:23.691 --> 01:10:25.492
What does Rich know
about basketball?

01:10:25.526 --> 01:10:27.294
He know... He know a little...

01:10:27.327 --> 01:10:29.697
All you need to do is tell
the people to give me the ball.

01:10:29.731 --> 01:10:31.699
I don't know
these guys on the team.

01:10:31.733 --> 01:10:33.467
I just need for me
to get the ball to win.

01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:34.702
You're the man, right?

01:10:34.736 --> 01:10:36.403
I'm gonna give you
what you want.

01:10:36.436 --> 01:10:37.939
But you just brought him
in the mix.

01:10:37.972 --> 01:10:39.874
So if you lose, he lose, too.

01:10:39.907 --> 01:10:41.776
And both of you
ain't going home.

01:10:43.644 --> 01:10:45.278
Alright, man.

01:10:45.312 --> 01:10:47.615
So let's see
what your game about.

01:10:54.889 --> 01:10:57.491
That's checkmate.

01:10:57.525 --> 01:10:58.926
Take him back to his cell.

01:10:59.894 --> 01:11:01.062
Inmates!

01:11:02.496 --> 01:11:05.066
Inmates!
I need you all to gather around.

01:11:05.099 --> 01:11:07.300
Gather around.

01:11:09.737 --> 01:11:11.906
Officer Gibbs
bringing his son in here

01:11:11.939 --> 01:11:14.008
through the
Scared Straight program.

01:11:14.041 --> 01:11:16.878
We are only here
to give him a reality check.

01:11:16.911 --> 01:11:22.083
With that being said, there is
to be no disrespectful remarks

01:11:22.116 --> 01:11:24.051
and no physical contact.

01:11:24.085 --> 01:11:25.720
We have that understood?

01:11:25.753 --> 01:11:27.454
Understood.

01:11:32.727 --> 01:11:33.895
Yeah, bring them in here.

01:11:33.928 --> 01:11:35.530
Fresh fish, y'all.

01:11:35.563 --> 01:11:38.498
Mm. Oh, you a tough guy.
I got somebody for you.

01:11:38.533 --> 01:11:40.601
Hey, what's happening?

01:11:40.635 --> 01:11:42.603
What the hell you doing
shaking his hand?

01:11:42.637 --> 01:11:44.337
Dad, you don't remember him
from the block?

01:11:44.371 --> 01:11:46.641
Oh, yeah, I remember you.
You're the reason I moved.

01:11:46.674 --> 01:11:48.643
Let's get the hell
up out of here.

01:11:48.676 --> 01:11:50.711
That's enough!

01:11:57.384 --> 01:11:58.886
You don't belong on this side.

01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:00.655
You don't even look
that tough anyway.

01:12:00.688 --> 01:12:02.355
- Man, what are you talking...
- Nigga, you better not.

01:12:02.389 --> 01:12:04.625
You don't let anybody
talk to me like that.

01:12:04.659 --> 01:12:06.794
Oh, what the hell?!

01:12:16.537 --> 01:12:19.106
Guards, y'all ready?
Convicts, y'all ready?

01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:23.044
Let's have a good game, fellas.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

01:13:07.088 --> 01:13:09.156
We don't got a lot of time.
Got to get this shit right, man.

01:13:09.190 --> 01:13:10.558
You got to start throwing
them bounce passes

01:13:10.591 --> 01:13:11.993
a little harder, man.

01:13:12.026 --> 01:13:13.961
You got to start
swinging around that wing.

01:13:13.995 --> 01:13:15.529
And, Boone, you got to start
going a little more aggressive.

01:13:15.563 --> 01:13:16.864
They're not passing the ball
to me, man.

01:13:18.866 --> 01:13:20.868
I need the ball every time.

01:13:20.902 --> 01:13:22.536
Let's go, man.
Let's bring it in, man.

01:13:22.570 --> 01:13:24.772
"Convicts" on three, man.
Let's bring it in, man.

01:13:24.805 --> 01:13:27.909
One... two... three!

01:13:27.942 --> 01:13:30.778
Convicts!

01:13:58.139 --> 01:14:00.908
You're going to the hole!
You're going to the hole!

01:15:21.022 --> 01:15:22.957
Yo, man.

01:15:27.228 --> 01:15:28.963
Yo, bro, you good?

01:15:28.996 --> 01:15:32.033
I knew it.

01:15:32.066 --> 01:15:34.268
I knew. I knew it.

01:15:34.301 --> 01:15:36.237
Going through what, bro?

01:15:38.839 --> 01:15:41.709
They didn't have to
do Mowmow like that, Boone.

01:15:41.742 --> 01:15:43.344
When the funeral, bro?

01:15:43.377 --> 01:15:47.348
They don't have funerals
for cats like little Mowmow.

01:15:47.381 --> 01:15:50.084
No, no, no, that's wrong, Ju.
That's wrong.

01:15:50.117 --> 01:15:51.719
Everybody deserves
a proper burial, man.

01:15:51.752 --> 01:15:53.788
They sent me
his fucking head in a box.

01:15:55.022 --> 01:15:56.257
Huh?

01:15:56.824 --> 01:15:59.326
Oh, here I come.
Heard somebody calling me.

01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:01.028
Ain't nobody fucking
call you, Boone.

01:16:01.062 --> 01:16:04.832
But if you want to go,
fucking go.

01:16:04.865 --> 01:16:07.001
Yo, bro,
calm the fuck down, bro.

01:16:07.034 --> 01:16:08.302
Just chill, man.

01:16:08.335 --> 01:16:10.337
You don't understand.

01:16:10.371 --> 01:16:15.376
See, Mowmow used to
come over to my house

01:16:15.409 --> 01:16:18.646
and catch little mices
in the kitchen for me.

01:16:18.679 --> 01:16:21.015
She would... She would
give us little rewards

01:16:21.048 --> 01:16:22.883
and treats and stuff.

01:16:22.917 --> 01:16:25.119
A cat?

01:16:25.152 --> 01:16:26.353
You talking about a cat?

01:16:26.387 --> 01:16:29.023
Mowmow.

01:16:29.056 --> 01:16:30.724
You know what, Ju?

01:16:30.758 --> 01:16:32.093
I ain't gonna
fuckin' hold you, man.

01:16:32.126 --> 01:16:34.095
I'm not comfortable
right now, man.

01:16:34.128 --> 01:16:36.931
It's just, man,
y-y-y-you up here

01:16:36.964 --> 01:16:38.699
crying over a fucking cat, man.

01:16:38.732 --> 01:16:41.302
Like, this is crazy.
Like, for real, man.

01:16:42.803 --> 01:16:44.738
Just smoke this out
with me, please.

01:16:44.772 --> 01:16:46.373
Please just smoke one with me.

01:16:46.407 --> 01:16:47.908
You got weed?

01:16:47.942 --> 01:16:50.144
Yes, I got to get it
out my ass, but...

01:16:50.177 --> 01:16:51.412
Come on, Ju, man.

01:16:51.445 --> 01:16:52.813
You want to get it
out your ass, man.

01:16:52.847 --> 01:16:54.715
Come on, now.

01:16:54.748 --> 01:16:56.784
Anyway, we got hard-ass tissue
in here and hard-ass soap, man.

01:16:56.817 --> 01:16:58.152
Nobody smoking that shit.

01:16:58.185 --> 01:16:59.353
You can't even wipe your ass
properly, man.

01:16:59.386 --> 01:17:00.754
- Boone.
- Nah, man.

01:17:00.788 --> 01:17:02.089
Come on, Boone.

01:17:02.123 --> 01:17:04.024
Yo, that was
a good-ass game, Boone.

01:17:04.058 --> 01:17:06.727
Inmate brothers still
celebrating, though, cuz.

01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:08.095
Know what I'm saying?

01:17:08.129 --> 01:17:09.763
What's up with bul?

01:17:09.797 --> 01:17:11.432
One of his cats just died, man.

01:17:11.465 --> 01:17:13.367
- Mowmow.
- Yeah, I feel you, man.

01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:15.236
I remember when my homey died
in this joint.

01:17:15.269 --> 01:17:17.304
No, a <i>cat</i> cat, man.

01:17:17.338 --> 01:17:19.340
Talking about a cat.

01:17:19.373 --> 01:17:21.275
Yeah, and he wants...
he wants to smoke weed.

01:17:21.308 --> 01:17:22.843
He got weed.

01:17:22.877 --> 01:17:25.713
He got it... He gonna get it
out his ass, man.

01:17:25.746 --> 01:17:26.981
Oh, that's cool, bro.

01:17:27.014 --> 01:17:29.016
That's how it is in jail.
That's how it is.

01:17:30.284 --> 01:17:32.186
But you... you can't smoke,
though.

01:17:32.219 --> 01:17:33.387
You remember what happened
last time.

01:17:33.420 --> 01:17:35.422
Shit, I can smoke if I want to.

01:17:35.456 --> 01:17:38.259
What you talking about,
what happened last time?

01:17:41.729 --> 01:17:44.031
I think you should
have it first, bro.

01:17:46.267 --> 01:17:49.270
Rich, Boone.
Warden want to see y'all.

01:17:49.303 --> 01:17:51.472
Mowmow!

01:17:51.506 --> 01:17:52.873
There's a new fish in here.

01:17:52.907 --> 01:17:55.075
Alright, everybody
get pumped up.

01:17:55.109 --> 01:17:56.810
So I'm just letting you know.

01:17:56.844 --> 01:17:59.046
I heard that on the street.
You know what I'm saying.

01:17:59.079 --> 01:18:01.282
So gonna have me in here
for a minute, alright.

01:18:01.315 --> 01:18:03.751
So that's...
that's not a confession.

01:18:18.032 --> 01:18:21.035
Gentlemen, have a seat.

01:18:21.068 --> 01:18:22.770
What's up?

01:18:26.340 --> 01:18:28.042
First, I want
to congratulate you

01:18:28.075 --> 01:18:29.276
for the game that you just had.

01:18:29.310 --> 01:18:31.779
I was impressed.

01:18:33.948 --> 01:18:39.954
Second, I want to apologize
for you two even being here.

01:18:39.987 --> 01:18:42.756
Thirdly,
I want to commend you two

01:18:42.790 --> 01:18:45.125
for being the best two inmates
that came in my prison.

01:18:47.127 --> 01:18:50.264
It wasn't all that great.

01:18:50.297 --> 01:18:52.433
We did have some rocky times.

01:18:52.466 --> 01:18:54.235
But we made it through.

01:18:54.268 --> 01:18:56.036
And you two brought
some positive energy

01:18:56.070 --> 01:18:57.972
inside this prison.

01:18:58.973 --> 01:19:00.908
Are y'all high?

01:19:00.941 --> 01:19:02.776
What's wrong with him?

01:19:02.810 --> 01:19:05.045
No, no, no, we good. We just...

01:19:05.079 --> 01:19:06.247
We... We good, man. Come on.

01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:07.781
No, something's wrong.

01:19:07.815 --> 01:19:09.483
- Are you high?
- Come on.

01:19:11.452 --> 01:19:13.320
What's going on?

01:19:13.354 --> 01:19:15.189
- Come on.
- Rich, Rich, my leg's asleep.

01:19:15.222 --> 01:19:17.091
- I'm gonna fall if I get up.
- No, let's go.

01:19:17.124 --> 01:19:20.361
- Get up.
- Just slap my leg.

01:19:20.394 --> 01:19:22.429
Come on, man, let's go.

01:19:22.463 --> 01:19:25.332
You know, that... that happens
to me sometimes.

01:19:25.366 --> 01:19:26.934

But that's not gonna happen.

01:20:32.667 --> 01:20:34.435
He fucked my wife
and my daughter, man.

01:20:34.468 --> 01:20:36.136
Look, I gave this man my word.

01:20:36.170 --> 01:20:38.472
And in here, we both know
that means something.

01:20:39.473 --> 01:20:41.308
So he get a pass like that?

01:20:41.342 --> 01:20:42.876
I'm afraid so.

01:20:42.910 --> 01:20:44.411
While he here,
he under my protection.

01:20:44.445 --> 01:20:46.180
Look at him making faces
like this is a game.

01:20:47.649 --> 01:20:50.351
Look, Mike,
what you want to do, man?

01:20:51.985 --> 01:20:53.555
You right.

01:21:04.666 --> 01:21:07.301
- Thanks, man.
- Thank you, man.

01:21:07.334 --> 01:21:09.470
Gave me one night with my wife.
I appreciate that, man.

01:21:09.503 --> 01:21:12.039
You got up all up in that.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:21:12.072 --> 01:21:14.308
Yo, yo, yo, yo. That's my wife.
Have some respect, man.

01:21:14.341 --> 01:21:16.009
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:21:16.043 --> 01:21:18.178
Play too much, man.
Come on, let's go.

01:21:18.212 --> 01:21:19.581
Y'all good?

01:21:32.426 --> 01:21:33.695
Somebody stole all my shit.

01:21:33.728 --> 01:21:35.195
Look how I'm coming out
of there, man.

01:21:35.229 --> 01:21:37.064
- This is crazy, man.
- Man, we good, man.

01:21:37.097 --> 01:21:39.299
We about to go get cleaned up.
We going to dinner, man.

01:21:39.333 --> 01:21:41.536
I'm just saying,
you gonna turn up.

01:21:41.569 --> 01:21:43.437
Man, we about to go
get dressed, man.

01:21:43.470 --> 01:21:45.507
You bringing your wife?
We're going to dinner, bro.

01:21:45.540 --> 01:21:47.675
Come on, man, you know...
That's fucked up, man.

01:21:47.709 --> 01:21:49.611
Hi. This is Diana Washington
with the update

01:21:49.644 --> 01:21:52.279
with our local rappers
Philly Filthy Rich and Boone.

01:21:52.312 --> 01:21:54.081
Both rappers were released
from prison,

01:21:54.114 --> 01:21:55.349
and the charges were dropped.

01:21:55.382 --> 01:21:57.351
The arresting officer
has been detained

01:21:57.384 --> 01:21:59.186
and is awaiting a $10,000 bond.

01:21:59.219 --> 01:22:02.022
We are also receiving reports
that there was a female

01:22:02.055 --> 01:22:04.258
incarcerated along with
the two gentlemen.

01:22:04.291 --> 01:22:06.226
We'll keep you updated
as the story develops.

01:22:06.260 --> 01:22:07.494
Back to you.

01:22:09.564 --> 01:22:12.065
Yeah, it's your girl
DJ Diamond Kuts.

01:22:12.099 --> 01:22:14.602
Shout-outs to everybody
rocking with me right now.

01:22:14.636 --> 01:22:16.336
But before I go any further,

01:22:16.370 --> 01:22:20.040
I got to give a big shout-out
to Boone and Filthy Rich.

01:22:20.073 --> 01:22:21.275
Welcome home, y'all.

01:22:21.308 --> 01:22:24.011
This next song
is dedicated to you guys.

01:22:24.044 --> 01:22:27.414
I can truly say
justice has been served.

01:22:27.448 --> 01:22:30.050
Welcome home, y'all.
Let's get it.

01:22:30.083 --> 01:22:31.519

01:22:51.773 --> 01:22:53.140
What, you really want to know?

01:22:53.173 --> 01:22:54.374
Yeah, I really want to know.

01:22:54.408 --> 01:22:56.043
You act like you been

01:22:56.076 --> 01:22:58.011
Oh, man, you got time?
You got time for this?

01:22:58.045 --> 01:22:59.581
- Yeah, come on, let's have it.

01:22:59.614 --> 01:23:01.248
This is good.

01:23:01.281 --> 01:23:03.651
Malachi, put the phone down.

You're hungry?

01:23:15.663 --> 01:23:17.364
So look, yo,

Man.

01:23:31.846 --> 01:23:33.581
Come on, man.

01:23:33.615 --> 01:23:35.382
Alright, go ahead, go ahead.
I ain't gonna say nothing.

01:23:35.415 --> 01:23:37.519
Ain't nobody say nothing
when you was telling your shit.

01:23:37.552 --> 01:23:39.186
Alright, yeah, you right.
Go ahead.

01:23:39.219 --> 01:23:40.788
Yeah, what's up with the Imam?

01:23:40.822 --> 01:23:42.456
Tell her.

01:23:42.489 --> 01:23:43.725
He knocked your boy

01:23:43.758 --> 01:23:45.125
And I helped him.

01:23:45.158 --> 01:23:47.829

- You told her that, bitch?
- Yes.

01:23:55.335 --> 01:23:56.671
She know. She know everything.

01:23:56.704 --> 01:23:58.573
That's my lady.

01:23:58.606 --> 01:23:59.807
So she know I'm a fucking nut?

01:23:59.841 --> 01:24:01.308
Yeah.

01:24:02.877 --> 01:24:05.312
You're not supposed to do that
to your boy, bro.

01:24:07.214 --> 01:24:08.616
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
It's that cop.

01:24:08.650 --> 01:24:10.585
- The cop?
- What's up man?

01:24:10.618 --> 01:24:12.520
<i>Well, well, well,
motherfucker.</i>

01:24:12.554 --> 01:24:15.289
<i>You thought this shit
was just gonna be over?</i>

01:24:15.322 --> 01:24:17.357
<i>You get me fired
from the force?</i>

01:24:17.391 --> 01:24:19.226
<i>You kill my motherfucking dog?</i>

01:24:19.259 --> 01:24:21.328
- We didn't kill him.
- <i>Motherfuckers killed Cupcake.</i>

01:24:21.361 --> 01:24:23.430
<i>Ain't going the fuck out

01:24:23.463 --> 01:24:26.500
<i>I ain't gonna rest till both

01:24:26.534 --> 01:24:27.869
We gonna see.

01:24:27.902 --> 01:24:30.337
<i>It's cool. You real tough.</i>

01:24:30.370 --> 01:24:32.707
<i>That's why I'm gonna
get your ass first.</i>

01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:34.576
<i>Save the best for that
funny motherfucker last.</i>

01:24:34.609 --> 01:24:36.143
Man, you ain't
gonna do shit, man.

01:24:36.176 --> 01:24:37.344
Fuck your dog. Fuck you.

01:24:37.377 --> 01:24:38.746
- Hey, Rich.
- <i>Yeah?</i>

01:24:38.780 --> 01:24:40.815
<i>Okay, we gonna see.</i>

01:24:40.848 --> 01:24:42.750
<i>I know where you niggas is

01:24:42.784 --> 01:24:44.151
<i>I know where you niggas

01:24:44.184 --> 01:24:46.153
<i>and the day before that.</i>

01:24:46.186 --> 01:24:48.322
<i>I'll get your ass,
motherfucker.</i>

01:24:50.892 --> 01:24:53.427
What? What you mean?

01:24:53.460 --> 01:24:55.730
What the fuck is
wrong with you, Rich?

01:24:55.763 --> 01:24:57.765
How... How the hell you
gonna curse at that man

01:24:57.799 --> 01:24:59.166
after he say he gonna kill me?

01:24:59.199 --> 01:25:00.835
Motherfucker keep
calling my phone.

01:25:00.868 --> 01:25:03.303
I'll be back.
I'm going to the bathroom.

01:25:15.550 --> 01:25:17.719
Think everything funny.
You're just a gangster.

01:25:17.752 --> 01:25:19.186
It is funny.

01:25:23.457 --> 01:25:25.492
Come on.
That was probably Rich.

01:25:25.526 --> 01:25:26.728
What you mean, come on?

01:25:26.761 --> 01:25:28.295
Come on!

01:25:28.328 --> 01:25:30.263
- You think it was them?
- Come on.

01:25:30.297 --> 01:25:31.766
- Huh?
- Boone, come on.

01:25:31.799 --> 01:25:33.500
I got my son.

01:25:34.736 --> 01:25:36.738
Boone, come the fuck on.

01:25:36.771 --> 01:25:38.506
Come on, Malachi.

01:25:39.907 --> 01:25:41.876
Rich, what the fuck?
What happened?

01:25:41.909 --> 01:25:43.778
That fucking cop, man.

01:25:43.811 --> 01:25:45.278
He shot...
He hit you in your hand?

01:25:45.312 --> 01:25:46.781
Yeah, he shot me
in my fucking hand.

01:25:46.814 --> 01:25:48.783
I can't get this...
I'm gonna go after that nigga.

01:25:48.816 --> 01:25:50.250
- You take care of him.
- No, no, no.

01:25:50.283 --> 01:25:52.486
No, no, no.
Take him to the hospital.

01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:54.421
- Look. Erica.
- No.

01:25:54.454 --> 01:25:55.790
- Listen.
- What? Boone!

01:25:55.823 --> 01:25:57.659
That's just wrong.
You're a black woman.

01:25:57.692 --> 01:25:59.493
Take him to the hospital.

01:25:59.527 --> 01:26:01.461
- I'm gonna go find this nigga.
- You see him run out there?

01:26:01.495 --> 01:26:02.864
I'm gonna catch him.

01:26:02.897 --> 01:26:04.398
Stop it. Stop.

01:26:04.431 --> 01:26:05.733
Everybody just stop and think.

01:26:05.767 --> 01:26:06.934
Let me call the police.

01:26:06.968 --> 01:26:08.402
- Take... Don't you...
- Listen.

01:26:08.435 --> 01:26:10.203
You better not
fucking call no cops.

01:26:10.237 --> 01:26:11.639
Take him to the hospital.

01:26:11.673 --> 01:26:13.206
Listen, it's obvious
this man's not playing.

01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:14.742
- Boone, shut up.
- I have my son with me.

01:26:14.776 --> 01:26:16.443
- Boone, shut up.
- I'm telling. I'm telling.

01:26:16.476 --> 01:26:17.845
- Take him to the hospital.
- No, I'm telling.

01:26:17.879 --> 01:26:19.246
Then just fucking tell.

01:26:19.279 --> 01:26:20.948
Yo, he said you next.

01:26:20.982 --> 01:26:22.650
You see what I'm saying?

01:26:22.684 --> 01:26:24.284
It's a long-ass...

01:26:24.317 --> 01:26:26.286
I know!

01:26:26.319 --> 01:26:27.655
You see what I'm saying?

01:26:27.689 --> 01:26:28.990
You see what you got me
dealing with?

01:26:29.023 --> 01:26:30.558
I got my fucking son,

01:26:30.591 --> 01:26:32.492
and you got your motherfucking
Wonder Woman

01:26:32.527 --> 01:26:33.828
running around here
and shit, man.

01:26:33.861 --> 01:26:36.329
And you already got shot
in the fucking hand.

01:26:36.363 --> 01:26:37.899
Come on, man.

01:26:38.866 --> 01:26:40.635
And he said I'm next?

01:26:40.668 --> 01:26:41.836
Yeah.

01:26:44.038 --> 01:26:45.573
Rich, you can't just...

01:26:45.606 --> 01:26:47.474
You got to stop going places
by yourself, man.

01:26:47.508 --> 01:26:48.843
Shut up. Come on.

01:26:48.876 --> 01:26:50.444
You got to stop going places
by yourself.

01:26:50.477 --> 01:26:52.013
Come on, I got to go
to the hospital, man.

01:26:52.046 --> 01:26:54.615
- Come on, man.
- Listen.

01:26:54.649 --> 01:26:57.384
See, that's why
you never listen, man.

01:26:57.417 --> 01:27:00.487
That's why I want... I want
to see if it's clear.

01:27:00.521 --> 01:27:02.724
'Cause I'm gonna let y'all two
motherfuckers get shot.

01:27:02.757 --> 01:27:05.292
I ain't gonna let us
get shot, alright, Malachi?

01:27:05.325 --> 01:27:06.527
- You alright?
- Yeah.

01:27:06.561 --> 01:27:09.329
- They ain't hit us.
- Unh-unh.

01:27:09.362 --> 01:27:10.998
Alright, let's go. We gonna
wait for them motherfuckers.

01:27:11.032 --> 01:27:13.300
Let's wait another five seconds.

01:27:16.738 --> 01:27:18.906
Yeah, matter of fact,
you go out there first.

01:27:20.407 --> 01:27:22.777
You go out there first
and see if somebody...

01:27:22.810 --> 01:27:24.512
Ain't nobody out there,
is there?

01:27:24.545 --> 01:27:26.480
- No.
- Alright.

01:27:33.921 --> 01:27:35.623

Shit always go down
when these two come around.

01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:16.731
They did a bid and became
the bid at the same damn time.

01:28:16.764 --> 01:28:19.634
Same charge, same jail,
same damn crime.

01:28:19.667 --> 01:28:21.468
You got Boone Fake Goon

01:28:21.501 --> 01:28:24.371
and Rich who thinks he's a vet
and the best that ever did it.

01:28:24.404 --> 01:28:27.474
Not sure which one of them gets
to be in the asshole credits.

01:28:27.508 --> 01:28:28.976
No, wait, I take that back.

01:28:29.010 --> 01:28:30.611
We gonna give Boone
those merits.

01:28:30.645 --> 01:28:33.346
So I'm glad y'all laughed,
enjoyed, and we joked.

01:28:33.380 --> 01:28:35.583
I'm glad y'all was able to get
y'all funny bone stroke.

01:28:35.616 --> 01:28:37.450
But right now
I need to switch gears.

01:28:37.484 --> 01:28:39.821
Too often in life, this shit
is happening for real.

01:28:39.854 --> 01:28:41.556
This shit is happening to us.

01:28:41.589 --> 01:28:42.824
Look at the rate
they booking us,

01:28:42.857 --> 01:28:44.692
they cooking us,
they roofing us.

01:28:44.725 --> 01:28:45.927
We may not have all the smarts,

01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:47.829
but let's not be
completely oblivious.

01:28:47.862 --> 01:28:49.730
This shit is serious
and continuous.

01:28:49.764 --> 01:28:51.566
They say all men
are created equal.

01:28:51.599 --> 01:28:53.034
When I look at
the sentencing guidelines,

01:28:53.067 --> 01:28:55.402
all I see is injustice
when it comes to our people.

01:28:55.435 --> 01:28:56.804
They want the law
to be respected.

01:28:56.838 --> 01:28:58.739
How likely is that
when you have laws in place

01:28:58.773 --> 01:29:00.575
based on misperception?

01:29:00.608 --> 01:29:02.877
The system is unethical,
skeptical.

01:29:02.910 --> 01:29:04.712
They try to trick us
by saying things like,

01:29:04.745 --> 01:29:05.980
"I want what's best for you."

01:29:06.013 --> 01:29:07.682
Shit is racially biased.

01:29:07.715 --> 01:29:09.382
Sick of this racial imbalance.

01:29:09.416 --> 01:29:11.152
How the hell'd
a low-level crack dealer

01:29:11.185 --> 01:29:13.386
get more time
than a wholesale supplier?

01:29:13.420 --> 01:29:16.657
Shout-out to Barack Obama for
passing the Fair Sentencing Act

01:29:16.691 --> 01:29:17.892
to even out the difference

01:29:17.925 --> 01:29:19.459
between a big dealer
selling powder

01:29:19.492 --> 01:29:20.928
and a small dealer
selling crack.

01:29:20.962 --> 01:29:23.030
He eliminated the minimum
10-year sentence,

01:29:23.064 --> 01:29:26.067
and not to mention they said
crack was more addictive.

01:29:26.100 --> 01:29:27.735
But we all know crack
was for the hood

01:29:27.768 --> 01:29:29.804
'cause it was cheap
and coke was more expensive.

01:29:29.837 --> 01:29:31.839
So damn right
it was a difference,

01:29:31.873 --> 01:29:33.908
but just not the way
they made it appear to be.

01:29:33.941 --> 01:29:35.109
If you pay close attention,

01:29:35.142 --> 01:29:37.511
shit is just a different
form of slavery.

01:29:37.545 --> 01:29:39.446
By the way, this is the law

01:29:39.479 --> 01:29:40.982
that got Richard Harris
out of prison

01:29:41.015 --> 01:29:44.018
after serving 11 1/2
of a 22-year sentence.

01:29:44.051 --> 01:29:46.687
Said he was coming home
to show up and show out.

01:29:46.721 --> 01:29:48.155
And that's exactly what he did.

01:29:48.189 --> 01:29:49.757
Then he linked up with Boone.

01:29:49.790 --> 01:29:51.959
And they presented y'all
with "The Bid."

01:29:51.993 --> 01:29:53.937
God bless and good night.
