WEBVTT

00:02.001 --> 00:05.632
We're beginning our initial
descent into Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

00:05.714 --> 00:07.182
Thank you for ?ying United.

00:07.257 --> 00:08.759
Reckon we'll
be landin' soon.

00:08.842 --> 00:10.810
Phil, honey, you promised.
Not till we got there.

00:10.886 --> 00:12.229
Okay.

00:12.304 --> 00:15.524
This year, we're goin' to a dude
ranch with the whole family.

00:15.599 --> 00:18.102
Mm-hmm.
The family.

00:18.185 --> 00:19.937
What if Dylan
buys his own ticket?

00:20.020 --> 00:22.398
We'll be sleeping
in separate cabins.

00:22.481 --> 00:25.735
What if Dylan and I
share a horse?

00:25.817 --> 00:27.990
Mmm. I hate landing.

00:30.405 --> 00:32.783
We'll get
through this.

00:33.825 --> 00:35.577
Wow. it's so pretty here.

00:35.661 --> 00:37.629
What are you doin'?

00:37.704 --> 00:39.456
I want my ears to pop.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.759
Try putting
a little rouge on 'em.

00:41.833 --> 00:43.710
Nobody gets me.

00:43.794 --> 00:45.922
Wow! isn't this beautiful,
little cowgirl?

00:46.046 --> 00:48.549
You hate her sparkly outfit, don't you?
No, I told you, it's fine.

00:48.632 --> 00:50.555
I just didn't like you
wearing a matching one.

00:50.634 --> 00:54.434
So we haven't told the family yet, but
we've decided to adopt a baby boy.

00:54.513 --> 00:57.141
From America this time. You might
say we're buying domestic.

00:57.224 --> 00:58.976
In private. You might
say that in private.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.982
Our adoption attorney told us
it would be a good idea ...

01:01.061 --> 01:03.234
to make a photo book to
show prospective moms.

01:03.313 --> 01:05.941
Yes. But he thought that Cam's
version was a little too "artsy,"

01:06.024 --> 01:09.870
so we've decided to take a few rugged shots
at the ranch to, you know, balance it out.

01:09.987 --> 01:11.989
I don't think it needs balancing out.
Really?

01:14.324 --> 01:16.543
It's called
production value.

01:18.328 --> 01:26.588
# Hey, hey #

01:26.670 --> 01:27.671
# Hey #

01:32.759 --> 01:34.261
Look. A horse!

01:34.344 --> 01:37.314
Look, Jay! So beautiful!

01:37.389 --> 01:39.266
Your ears haven't
popped yet, huh?

01:39.349 --> 01:41.443
I'm like
the Horse Whisperer!

01:41.518 --> 01:44.522
But something is making
this one skittish!

01:44.605 --> 01:46.778
Whoa.
Look at the mountains.

01:46.857 --> 01:48.325
They're amazing.

01:48.400 --> 01:51.199
I've never been this far from
home before.

01:51.278 --> 01:53.326
Now I've never been
this far.

01:53.405 --> 01:55.282
Now I've never
been this far.

01:55.365 --> 01:57.333
Where's a cliff
when you need one?

01:57.409 --> 02:00.083
Look, kids!
A real-life cowboy!

02:00.162 --> 02:02.164
Come over.
Come see, come see.

02:06.043 --> 02:07.545
Uh-oh.  What's he doing?

02:07.628 --> 02:08.595
Oh, my.

02:10.339 --> 02:12.307
Ooh!

02:12.382 --> 02:14.680
Yeah!

02:14.760 --> 02:16.762
My name is Hank.

02:16.845 --> 02:18.563
Here at the Lost Creek Ranch,

02:18.639 --> 02:21.813
you're gonna ride and you're gonna
rope and you're gonna shoot.

02:21.892 --> 02:27.069
You're gonna see a sky so full of stars,
it'll put your city lights to shame.

02:27.147 --> 02:30.651
And when it's all done,
you might just encounter ...

02:30.734 --> 02:33.658
a piece of yourselves
you never knew was there.

02:33.737 --> 02:35.205
Are there any questions?

02:35.280 --> 02:37.954
Do we book spa treatments
through you or-

02:38.033 --> 02:40.331
I like you, kid.

02:40.410 --> 02:42.629
I'm gonna call you Hollywood.

02:42.704 --> 02:45.048
Th-That wasn't an answer.

02:45.123 --> 02:47.876
And who's
this cactus ?ower?

02:48.001 --> 02:50.754
What?
That's my wife, Gloria.

02:50.837 --> 02:53.181
Well, she's Cactus Flower now,
Old-timer.

02:53.256 --> 02:56.305
These nicknames-
Are they set in stone?

02:56.385 --> 03:00.060
Okeydokey.
You ready, gunslinger?

03:00.138 --> 03:03.108
Heard word of trouble
in these parts.

03:03.975 --> 03:05.067
Pull!

03:08.188 --> 03:10.941
- That oughta fix it, eh, Jay?
- You got a piece of it.

03:12.317 --> 03:15.287
I've been practicing like crazy-
all my cowboy skills.

03:15.362 --> 03:18.115
Shootin', ropin', pancake eatin'.

03:18.198 --> 03:21.793
Why? Because sometimes, I feel like
Jay doesn't respect me as a man.

03:21.868 --> 03:24.041
It's just that when you say
"Phil is my son-in-law,"

03:24.121 --> 03:26.840
it sounds like you're saying,
"Phyllis," comma, "my son-in-law."

03:26.957 --> 03:28.959
That's ridiculous. Okay,
who's your son-in-law?

03:29.042 --> 03:30.669
Phil is.

03:30.752 --> 03:33.801
I'm not asking for a hug. I just want
to get that look of new found respect.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.632
Like-
Oh!

03:35.716 --> 03:37.389
Or-

03:38.802 --> 03:42.682
Or- Mmm. Yeah.

03:43.682 --> 03:46.356
Check it out.
Two birds, one leg.

03:46.435 --> 03:48.358
Pull it!

03:51.523 --> 03:54.072
- Not bad, eh, Old-timer?
- Huh?

03:54.151 --> 03:57.997
See, Slappy only
had three fingers.

03:59.656 --> 04:02.455
- What?
- He only had three fingers!

04:03.869 --> 04:05.371
- Who's next?
- Oh, me, me.

04:05.454 --> 04:07.798
Oh, this is good.
This is good.

04:09.332 --> 04:11.460
TrÃ©s macho.

04:11.543 --> 04:13.216
No smile.
Don't smile. Good.

04:13.295 --> 04:14.763
You ready?

04:14.880 --> 04:16.882
Wait, do I say "Pull"?

04:17.007 --> 04:18.509
Sorry, sorry.
Whoa!

04:18.591 --> 04:22.517
Mitchell, why don't you
go find Manny at the spa?

04:22.596 --> 04:25.270
Wouldn't that be more fun?

04:25.348 --> 04:27.316
Yeah.

04:27.392 --> 04:30.817
I realized that if I was gonna raise
a boy, I needed to butch up my life.

04:30.896 --> 04:35.322
You know, I wanted to be able to teach my son
all the things that my dad taught Claire.

04:45.702 --> 04:48.421
Hey, Hollywood.
I don't love that.

04:48.497 --> 04:50.670
You wanna see something?

04:50.791 --> 04:54.170
Oh, my gosh! Is that a firecracker?
Shh!

04:54.252 --> 04:56.755
Now I just need to find
the perfect thing to blow up.

04:56.838 --> 05:00.388
- Is that thing even legal?
- Not here. It's from Germany.

05:00.467 --> 05:03.687
If they had this during the war, right
now we'd all be knee-deep in strudel.

05:10.352 --> 05:12.901
- Watch it!
- What ya doin', eh?

05:12.979 --> 05:14.822
You readin'?
Trying to.

05:14.898 --> 05:17.242
- I'm not so good at it either.
- I'm not surprised.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.819
That was a joke.

05:18.902 --> 05:20.870
I'm Jimmy Scrivano.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.791
You want to see me
do a cannonball?

05:24.908 --> 05:28.037
I'd rather see you get hit by one.
Hah!

05:28.119 --> 05:30.292
Good one, gorgeous.

05:34.292 --> 05:36.135
Hyah!

05:36.211 --> 05:38.805
Jay! Is this
like the lobster?

05:38.880 --> 05:42.976
Do I get to pick one for dinner?
Because this one looks very tender!

05:43.051 --> 05:46.021
Look alive, Old-timer! One of
your calves is gettin' away.

05:46.096 --> 05:48.064
Somethin' wrong with my horse.
She's veering left.

05:48.139 --> 05:50.187
When this happened to my uncle,
it was a stroke.

05:50.267 --> 05:53.737
Oh, there's nothin' wrong with Buttercup.
You just gotta let her know who's boss.

05:53.812 --> 05:56.986
Beautiful form,
Cactus Flower!

05:57.065 --> 06:00.444
Beautiful! You look like
a dadgum conquistadora.

06:00.527 --> 06:02.120
She's deaf,
but I can hear ya.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.697
Why are you
riding that way?

06:03.780 --> 06:05.908
I was afraid that cow
over there might bite me.

06:05.991 --> 06:09.712
Oh, yes, he's gonna come up and bite you because
your leg looks so desirable with those-

06:09.786 --> 06:11.584
Are those canvas?

06:11.663 --> 06:13.381
Okay, Phil, ease that one
back over towards me.

06:13.498 --> 06:15.000
Got it.
Ease him back this way.

06:15.083 --> 06:16.801
Hup-hup! Hey!

06:16.877 --> 06:18.754
- Piece of cake, huh,Jay? - Huh?

06:18.837 --> 06:21.306
- Ease that one over to Bossy.
- Which one's Bossy?

06:21.381 --> 06:23.054
That's my
nickname for your wife.

06:23.133 --> 06:24.976
Hilarious.

06:25.093 --> 06:27.516
Whoa. Whoa.
Go, Mom! Whoo!

06:27.596 --> 06:29.269
Yo, Mom! You rock!

06:29.347 --> 06:31.224
Oh, I wish I had a rock.

06:31.308 --> 06:34.983
Hey. It wouldn't kill you
to be nice to Dylan.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.859
It might.

06:36.938 --> 06:40.988
What- Honey, I don't know why you always stick up for him.
Haley can do so much better.

06:41.067 --> 06:44.537
Because I know what it's like to fall for a
girl whose dad thinks I'm not good enough.

06:46.907 --> 06:49.751
All right. You're right.
I can make more of an effort.

06:49.826 --> 06:51.828
That's the woman I love.

06:53.496 --> 06:55.874
We take a little break over here?
Layin' some pipe?

06:55.999 --> 06:58.093
No, sorry. I was just
talkin' to Bossy. Uh-huh.

06:58.168 --> 06:59.511
Phil!
I'm sorry.

06:59.586 --> 07:02.715
Jay, look!
I got this one!

07:02.839 --> 07:06.139
I got this one!
She's veering left again.

07:06.217 --> 07:09.517
When we get back, I'm gonna see if she
can track a pencil with her eyes.

07:09.596 --> 07:13.226
Okay, Lily, I'm going
to push you one more time.

07:13.308 --> 07:15.686
Now don't kick me, okay?

07:20.982 --> 07:23.952
Lily!
I said don't kick me, okay?

07:24.027 --> 07:26.997
You know, it's your own
fault that's happening.

07:27.072 --> 07:30.076
- Why don't you try standing behind her?
- You are an idiot.

07:30.158 --> 07:32.160
Oh, really? I ain't the
one getting kicked.

07:32.285 --> 07:35.334
Why are you following me? Why are
you fighting me here, gorgeous?

07:35.413 --> 07:37.336
This works.

07:37.415 --> 07:41.386
I really, really don't appreciate
you calling me "gorgeous."

07:41.461 --> 07:44.260
I just want to enjoy time with
my family, so if you don't mind-

07:44.339 --> 07:46.558
Mmm-

07:46.633 --> 07:49.182
Not a problem.
See you around, sunshine.

07:50.220 --> 07:52.894
You kissed a boy!

07:52.973 --> 07:56.603
No, the boy kissed me,
okay, Lily?

07:56.685 --> 07:58.187
Boy kissed me.

07:59.396 --> 08:02.570
# I rode a horse
for the first time today #

08:02.649 --> 08:05.778
# I wasn't surprised
when it went "Neigh" #

08:05.860 --> 08:08.784
- Hey, Dylan.
- Hey. Ms. Dunphy.

08:08.863 --> 08:11.286
I was wondering
if we could have a little chat.

08:11.366 --> 08:13.789
Uh- You want me
to go home.

08:13.868 --> 08:16.792
No. No, it's the-
the opposite of that.

08:16.871 --> 08:20.375
- I want you to go home?
- Mmm. Mm-mmm.

08:20.458 --> 08:25.134
No, I, um- I want you to know
how glad I am that you're here.

08:25.213 --> 08:27.011
Really?

08:27.090 --> 08:29.309
'Cause sometimes I just get
this vibe you don't like me.

08:29.384 --> 08:31.853
No. Dylan, no.
I'm sorry.

08:31.928 --> 08:36.104
L- I like you.
I- I like you a lot. I just-

08:36.182 --> 08:39.436
it's complicated, because ...
Haley's my daughter.

08:39.519 --> 08:42.443
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

08:42.522 --> 08:46.072
You are totally a hot mom,
but I can't do this.

08:46.151 --> 08:49.496
Oh, my God! Okay.
There's- No, no.

08:49.571 --> 08:54.077
I merely meant that I'm sorry
if I made you feel unwelcome.

08:54.159 --> 08:57.709
- Phew! That would've been awkward.
- So awkward!

08:57.787 --> 09:00.381
You know, but for the
record, Ms. Dunphy-

09:00.457 --> 09:01.583
Yes?

09:01.666 --> 09:03.464
If Haley wasn't
my girlfriend,

09:03.543 --> 09:06.046
and Mr. Dunphy was
out of the picture,

09:06.129 --> 09:08.177
I would be honored
to share your bed ...

09:08.256 --> 09:10.679
and raise Luke, Alex
and Haley as my own.

09:12.552 --> 09:13.678
Okay.

09:14.596 --> 09:16.269
Good talk.

09:19.350 --> 09:21.227
# She'll be runnin'
down the mountain #

09:21.311 --> 09:25.066
# She'll be runnin'
down the mountain #

09:25.148 --> 09:29.324
# She'll be runnin' down the
mountain when she come g;

09:29.402 --> 09:31.700
The song ended
two minutes ago!

09:31.780 --> 09:34.659
Well, I tell you what.
She could play Evita.

09:34.741 --> 09:38.211
Really? You notice
the crickets left?

09:38.328 --> 09:40.501
Anyone want more water?
Oh, Dad, I'll take one.

09:41.247 --> 09:42.248
Heads up.

09:42.332 --> 09:43.834
Oh, my gosh.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.304
It was- It was dark. I couldn't see it.
Thank you.

09:47.378 --> 09:49.426
So, did you set off
the firecracker yet?

09:49.506 --> 09:51.975
When I do,
you won't have to ask.

09:52.050 --> 09:54.394
First, all the
electronics will go out.

09:54.469 --> 09:56.563
Then comes
the heat flash.

09:56.638 --> 09:59.608
Afterwards, the living
will envy the dead.

09:59.682 --> 10:02.856
And yet I'm the one
on the no-fly list.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.906
Know what? Maybe next time I'll just
catch it and then hand it to you.

10:06.022 --> 10:07.524
Oh, okay.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.575
Yeah, let's do that. You do
everything, and I'll do nothing.

10:09.692 --> 10:13.071
Something on your mind? This isn't
the right place to talk about it.

10:13.696 --> 10:15.414
Okay.

10:15.490 --> 10:17.037
L- I'm just-

10:17.117 --> 10:19.461
I'm not sure if we should
have another baby.

10:19.536 --> 10:21.083
What? Are you serious?

10:21.204 --> 10:23.878
I think that we might be rushing into this.
Rushing into it?

10:23.957 --> 10:25.630
We've been working on-

10:25.708 --> 10:28.757
Everybody.
It's me, Dylan.

10:28.837 --> 10:32.387
I just wanted to thank you all
for bringing me on this trip ...

10:32.465 --> 10:35.218
and making me feel
like one of the family.

10:35.301 --> 10:37.975
- Especially Bossy.
- Aww.

10:38.054 --> 10:40.603
So, I can't think
of a better time ...

10:40.682 --> 10:44.858
to ask something of the
woman that I love.

10:44.936 --> 10:46.688
Okay.

10:49.232 --> 10:51.109
No, no.

10:51.192 --> 10:55.368
Haley Gwendolyn Dunphy, will you do me
the honors of being my lawfully wedded-

10:55.446 --> 10:59.076
No. No, no, no, no! No proposals!
Not now. Not gonna happen.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.832
- She's a child, so-
- Mom!

11:00.910 --> 11:03.379
- You're still in high school!
- I meant after she graduates.

11:03.454 --> 11:05.752
Not then, not now,
not ever.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.755
Seriously, what are you two
gonna live off of?

11:07.834 --> 11:10.087
The royalties from the horsey song?
Put it back in your pocket.

11:10.211 --> 11:13.181
Would you stop it!
No, I won't. I won't.

11:13.256 --> 11:16.635
No, it's okay.
I guess I'll just turn in.

11:16.718 --> 11:20.143
Just so you know, there's a fan in my
cabin that sounds like someone crying.

11:20.263 --> 11:22.607
Oh, God. Dylan, wait!
I hate you!

11:22.682 --> 11:26.732
Oh, come on! Haley, get back here.
Phil? Anything?

11:26.811 --> 11:29.690
I think you said it all, Claire.
You want me to rope her?

11:29.772 --> 11:31.991
I can, you know.

11:32.066 --> 11:35.616
For what it's worth, my second
wife was in high school.

11:40.617 --> 11:42.210
Let's do it again.

11:42.327 --> 11:45.672
One, two, three.
Two, three.

11:45.788 --> 11:47.506
Gone.
it's gone!

11:47.624 --> 11:50.173
It's over there!
it's not back there.

11:50.251 --> 11:52.094
We counted to three!
Yes.

11:52.170 --> 11:53.763
- Hey.
- Where have you been?

11:53.838 --> 11:55.556
I slept on the couch
in the lodge.

11:55.632 --> 11:58.511
- I know you didn't want to have a big fight last night.
- Well, I'm ready now.

11:58.593 --> 12:00.721
Cam, I'm sorry.

12:00.803 --> 12:02.897
Look, what if I can't do
the father-son stuff?

12:02.972 --> 12:05.725
The hunting, the- the sports,
The Three Stooges.

12:05.808 --> 12:08.903
You know what happens in real life when
someone gets hit in the head with a ladder?

12:08.978 --> 12:12.482
They go to the hospital and they get an M.R.I.
Never see that scene.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.442
I think you're
overthinking this.

12:14.525 --> 12:17.779
You know, I love sports. I love the Stooges.
We've got this covered.

12:17.862 --> 12:20.411
No. No, you- you've
got it covered.

12:20.490 --> 12:25.371
I'm just stuck on the sidelines,
pretending to understand the rules and-

12:25.453 --> 12:29.754
You know, my dad was a rough and tumble guy,
and I just- I could never relate to him.

12:29.832 --> 12:34.508
I don't know. I just don't think I could
handle disappointing two generations.

12:34.587 --> 12:37.807
I think you're more masculine than
you give yourself credit for.

12:38.841 --> 12:40.343
Oh, God!

12:40.426 --> 12:42.679
Who puts a birdhouse
next to a porch?

12:44.347 --> 12:47.692
Claire, I know that you're worried that
Dylan is gonna break Haley's heart,

12:47.767 --> 12:50.862
but I see in his eyes that he's
gonna stick with her forever.

12:50.937 --> 12:53.611
No matter what, he's always
going to be with her.

12:53.690 --> 12:55.784
- On your deathbed.
- Okay. All right.

12:55.858 --> 12:58.156
I can't take this anymore.
I'm gonna go find her.

12:58.236 --> 13:00.659
No. You push too hard, you
chase her right into his arms.

13:00.738 --> 13:04.083
You'll end up with a boob for a son-in-law.
Believe me, you don't want that.

13:04.158 --> 13:06.206
- What's that supposed to mean?
- What?

13:06.286 --> 13:08.004
Hey, have you guys
seen Dylan?

13:08.079 --> 13:09.672
No. No, why?
I'm not talking to you.

13:09.747 --> 13:13.126
He said he was going out for a walk last
night, and no one's seen him since.

13:13.209 --> 13:14.836
Sweetheart,
I'm sure he's fine.

13:14.919 --> 13:16.887
Maybe after last night,
he just went home.

13:17.005 --> 13:19.508
Doubt it. He left his luggage.
We have to do something.

13:19.590 --> 13:22.218
If he doesn't eat five times
a day, he gets spacey.

13:22.343 --> 13:24.971
What would that even look like?
We'll find him.

13:25.054 --> 13:27.648
Hank?
We got a situation here!

13:27.724 --> 13:30.193
What seems
to be the trouble?

13:33.354 --> 13:35.777
We need to talk.
What?

13:35.898 --> 13:39.118
You stole my first kiss!
What are you talkin' about?

13:39.193 --> 13:42.117
I had it all planned out.
it was supposed to be special.

13:42.196 --> 13:45.871
Someone with a high G.P.A. and a
bright future, not a Mario Brother.

13:45.950 --> 13:48.669
Fine! You know what?
I don't even want your kiss.

13:48.745 --> 13:50.247
Here, you can
have it back.

13:51.956 --> 13:53.549
There.
Now we're even.

13:53.624 --> 13:55.592
Keep it! I don't- I
don't want it anymore.

13:58.379 --> 13:59.972
What am I doing?

14:00.048 --> 14:04.019
Okay, people.
Looks like we have a walker.

14:04.093 --> 14:07.893
Right now he is facing treacherous
terrain, sudden drops,

14:07.972 --> 14:11.852
mountain lions, hungry bears-
oh, and wolverines.

14:11.934 --> 14:14.653
That is, if the hypothermia
didn't already get him.

14:14.729 --> 14:16.857
Why did we come here again?

14:16.939 --> 14:18.907
So, our best bet
is to split up.

14:18.983 --> 14:20.985
You two are gonna take
to the north hiking trail.

14:21.069 --> 14:22.946
Can I go with my dad instead?
Negative.

14:23.029 --> 14:27.205
I need Buffalo Phil and Old-timer
to check the Snake River.

14:27.283 --> 14:28.876
Buffalo Phil.

14:28.951 --> 14:30.248
Worth the wait.

14:30.328 --> 14:33.548
Me and Cactus Flower will
ride on up to Destiny Ridge.

14:33.623 --> 14:35.466
Maybe I should
ride up there with her.

14:35.541 --> 14:38.886
Negatory. That trail is
for advanced riders only.

14:38.961 --> 14:41.714
- We don't need another dead body.
- "Another"?

14:41.798 --> 14:43.641
Let's go!
Move 'em out.

14:45.468 --> 14:48.472
Phil, help me saddle up
my horse, will you?

14:48.554 --> 14:51.023
Well, look who's suddenly needed
by his father-in-law.

14:51.099 --> 14:52.521
Phyllis.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.273
Phil ... is.

14:57.146 --> 14:59.023
Hey, Uncle Mitch.
What ya doin'?

14:59.107 --> 15:02.577
Oh, hey.
Just- Just thinkin'.

15:02.652 --> 15:06.247
You know, I've been meaning to tell
you, you're a super-fun uncle.

15:06.322 --> 15:08.290
And I'm saying this
as a boy.

15:08.408 --> 15:12.129
Uncle Cameron sent you over here, didn't he?
What? That's hilarious!

15:12.203 --> 15:14.126
No, I love how you and me
can joke like this.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.464
Okay.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.634
Luke, look. I don't know
how much Cam told you,

15:17.708 --> 15:20.587
but I don't think this is a problem
that you can help me with.

15:20.670 --> 15:23.344
Okay, good.
Got my own problem.

15:23.464 --> 15:26.593
Wh- What's that?
Can you keep a secret?

15:26.676 --> 15:29.725
I kept a pretty big one
for 22 years, so-

15:29.804 --> 15:32.899
I've got this new firecracker, and
I can't decide what to blow up.

15:33.015 --> 15:36.485
Oh, Luke, that's dangerous. I know!
That's what's fun about it.

15:36.561 --> 15:38.063
I don't get boys.

15:38.146 --> 15:40.194
What is so great
about destroying things?

15:40.273 --> 15:43.903
It turns stuff into
flying chunks of stuff.

15:43.985 --> 15:46.283
Okay. No. No.
Give it to me.

15:46.362 --> 15:47.909
Fine.

15:47.989 --> 15:50.663
I take it back.
You're not that fun.

15:55.830 --> 15:57.878
All right.
Hey, look, um-

15:57.957 --> 15:59.880
We'll do it together,
all right?

16:01.085 --> 16:03.463
You just made the best
decision of your life.

16:03.546 --> 16:04.889
Okay.

16:07.675 --> 16:09.973
Damn it, Buttercup!

16:10.052 --> 16:12.271
What the hell's wrong
with this horse?

16:13.890 --> 16:15.187
Jay.

16:15.266 --> 16:17.143
Wow.

16:17.226 --> 16:19.979
I want to talk to you about that
son-in-law crack you made at breakfast.

16:20.104 --> 16:22.823
Oh, I didn't mean anything by that!
I think you did.

16:22.899 --> 16:26.278
I get that I wasn't your first choice to
marry Claire, but it's been 18 years,

16:26.360 --> 16:28.954
and there hasn't been a day when I wasn't
a loyal husband to your daughter ...

16:29.030 --> 16:30.577
and a great dad
to your grandkids.

16:30.656 --> 16:33.580
So if we've still got a problem,
now it's your problem.

16:40.416 --> 16:41.918
Phil, wait up.

16:43.544 --> 16:47.014
Can I ask you something, man to man?
Okay.

16:47.089 --> 16:50.969
You notice anything funny
about that Hank character and-

16:51.052 --> 16:52.850
Gloria? Yeah, he's hitting on her.
Why?

16:52.929 --> 16:54.272
I knew it.

16:54.388 --> 16:56.766
Where are you going?
Destiny Ridge.

16:57.767 --> 17:02.022
Buttercup, hyah!

17:02.104 --> 17:03.606
Seriously?

17:06.067 --> 17:07.865
Okay. Okay, it's clear.

17:07.944 --> 17:10.288
After this, we're gonna
have some angry birds.

17:10.363 --> 17:13.958
Yeah. It's gonna
be Bye Bye Birdie.

17:14.909 --> 17:16.832
It's a big musical
from the '60s.

17:16.911 --> 17:18.538
No, forget it.
What you said.

17:18.621 --> 17:20.589
Okay.

17:20.665 --> 17:22.258
Okay. Go!

17:22.375 --> 17:23.968
Cool!

17:27.463 --> 17:29.716
- That's it?
- I'm sorry, buddy.

17:29.799 --> 17:31.551
I brought that thing
all the way from-

17:31.634 --> 17:33.511
Whoa!
Whoa!

17:37.139 --> 17:39.562
Cam!
I did a boy thing!

17:39.642 --> 17:41.940
I blew up the birdhouse!
You should've seen it.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.938
It was so awesome!
That's great!

17:44.021 --> 17:45.944
Yeah.
I think I can do this.

17:46.023 --> 17:49.243
I mean, maybe not everything, and maybe not
right away, and not The Three Stooges.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.158
No.
But ... I do.

17:51.237 --> 17:53.205
I want a son.

17:53.322 --> 17:55.620
I'm sorry I panicked.
Oh, that's great.

17:55.700 --> 17:57.998
Now maybe we can go back
to taking pictures for the book.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.000
Yes! Pictures of me
blowing up stuff!

18:00.079 --> 18:02.707
Okay. I see
we've overcorrected.

18:02.790 --> 18:06.590
I know you think I'm the mean mom who
wouldn't let you marry your boyfriend,

18:06.669 --> 18:09.843
but someday you're gonna realize
I- I did what had to be done.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.595
No, you didn't.

18:11.674 --> 18:14.393
I was never gonna marry Dylan.
I told him no.

18:14.510 --> 18:18.140
You did? Thank God. But it was
my proposal to turn down.

18:18.264 --> 18:22.394
You know, you keep telling me to act like an
adult, but then you don't even give me a chance.

18:22.476 --> 18:25.776
Well, I-
You sort of got me there.

18:25.855 --> 18:28.108
But, sweetheart, I don't
expect you to understand this.

18:28.190 --> 18:30.443
I certainly didn't
when I was your age.

18:30.526 --> 18:33.279
I look at you as my baby,
and I always will.

18:33.404 --> 18:37.705
It's just what moms do.
I'm not a baby anymore, okay?

18:37.783 --> 18:40.377
And I am never gonna
see Dylan again!

18:40.453 --> 18:43.377
Dylan! Dylan!

18:43.456 --> 18:45.083
What?

18:45.207 --> 18:48.051
Where are you?
Wyoming!

18:49.086 --> 18:52.556
- You're okay!
- I had the craziest night.

18:52.632 --> 18:56.136
When you rejected me,
I felt lost and scared.

18:56.218 --> 18:58.141
And then
I went out on a walk,

18:58.220 --> 19:00.848
and I felt a whole different
kind of lost and scared.

19:00.931 --> 19:02.854
Then I fell asleep
in the stable,

19:02.933 --> 19:07.063
and when I woke up, I met this woman
named Jake, who's strong like a man.

19:07.146 --> 19:10.776
Then we had this long talk,
and he- she hired me.

19:10.858 --> 19:13.327
Uh, wha- What do you mean,
she hired you?

19:13.444 --> 19:16.118
I work here now.
So you're staying?

19:16.197 --> 19:17.665
Yeah.

19:17.782 --> 19:19.784
What about us?
It could never work.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.835
We're from
two different worlds.

19:21.911 --> 19:25.290
You're a high school student,
and I'm a ranch hand.

19:26.374 --> 19:28.593
I'm just-
I'm so glad you're okay.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.545
I really am. I am.
Thanks.

19:30.628 --> 19:33.051
But we're not supposed to
fraternize with the guests.

19:33.130 --> 19:34.598
Right.

19:36.425 --> 19:38.894
Dylan!

19:40.012 --> 19:43.232
Dylan!

19:43.307 --> 19:46.026
You got a voice like a
meadowlark, don't ya?

19:46.102 --> 19:49.402
Dylan!

19:49.480 --> 19:51.699
I sure am worried
about that kid.

19:51.774 --> 19:54.368
Dylan-

19:54.485 --> 19:57.204
He ain't down there.
Oh, come on now.

19:57.279 --> 20:00.658
You come up here
for the cowboy experience.

20:00.741 --> 20:02.288
You're lookin' at him.

20:02.368 --> 20:04.791
Do I look like the kind of woman
that would cheat on her husband?

20:04.870 --> 20:07.749
- Yes.
- Really?

20:07.832 --> 20:12.178
Hey! Think you better move
away from that woman.

20:12.253 --> 20:14.381
Only we touch our women
when they don't want us to.

20:14.463 --> 20:18.184
Easy. Easy there, friend-o.
I wasn't hittin' on this filly.

20:18.259 --> 20:20.478
This is all part
of the package.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.601
If I didn't
play the bad guy,

20:22.680 --> 20:24.899
he wouldn't get to ride up
and be the big hero.

20:24.974 --> 20:28.353
He doesn't need you to make him a hero.
He's a hero every day!

20:28.436 --> 20:29.983
Why don't you
do us all a favor?

20:30.062 --> 20:32.485
Get back on your horse, ride
down to the lodge and tell 'em-

20:32.606 --> 20:35.200
Can you keep him still? I'm
trying to make a point. I am.

20:35.276 --> 20:37.995
Okay, okay, I'm gone.
Ma'am.

20:38.988 --> 20:40.661
Wait.

20:40.740 --> 20:43.619
Wait! There's something
I want to say to you.

20:43.701 --> 20:46.170
I will only be checking "somewhat
satisfied" on our comment card.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.337
Oh, geez.

20:48.330 --> 20:50.003
I mean, he was great
with the kids.

20:54.170 --> 20:55.672
I looked it up.

20:55.755 --> 20:59.305
The distance between our houses
is 2,443 miles.

20:59.383 --> 21:02.512
Yeah, but on some maps
it's, like, this big.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.848
God, you're stupid.

21:07.183 --> 21:10.562
All in all,
it was a great vacation.

21:10.644 --> 21:12.646
We may have lost a man,

21:16.066 --> 21:18.615
but out there on the range,
under that great big sky,

21:18.694 --> 21:22.164
