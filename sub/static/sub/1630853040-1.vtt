two, three times for fighting,

12:40.666 --> 12:43.916
which is ironic
because you can't fight to save your life.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.375
[in unison] Hawking! Zip it!

12:46.833 --> 12:47.708
[whines]

12:51.291 --> 12:53.000
How do you know my dog's name?

12:53.083 --> 12:54.958
Because I named him.

12:56.875 --> 12:58.208
-Where are you goin'?
-[gasps]

12:58.291 --> 13:00.458
-[wheezing]
-Oh God.

13:03.416 --> 13:04.833
[shakes inhaler] All right.

13:06.208 --> 13:08.833
Here, ready? Deep breath.

13:08.916 --> 13:09.750
Hold it.

13:10.416 --> 13:13.291
Three, two, one.

13:13.375 --> 13:14.500
[exhales]

13:14.583 --> 13:15.833
Everybody gets a trophy.

13:15.916 --> 13:17.000
[grunts]

13:17.083 --> 13:18.416
When I was seven,

13:20.041 --> 13:22.083
I ran into a table on the patio.

13:23.416 --> 13:24.750
I got 12 stitches.

13:26.291 --> 13:27.500
[in unison] Right here.

13:30.458 --> 13:32.708
You knew how to get into my dad's garage.

13:32.791 --> 13:35.291
You knew how to close the fridge.

13:36.416 --> 13:38.208
You knew how to time my breathing.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.708
We have the same scar.

13:43.166 --> 13:46.041
And you're wearing my dad's watch.

13:52.458 --> 13:53.375
This watch.

13:54.708 --> 13:55.666
This watch.

14:00.208 --> 14:01.250
You're me.

14:02.625 --> 14:03.583
Holy shi--

14:03.666 --> 14:05.541
That's classified. But yes…

14:07.666 --> 14:08.583
I once was.

14:10.833 --> 14:12.041
-[coughs]
-[wound farts]

14:15.708 --> 14:17.916
I can't believe you're future me.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.500
Okay, you came to terms with that
pretty quickly.

14:20.583 --> 14:22.125
It's a little disturbing, actually.

14:22.208 --> 14:24.458
-So why are you here?
-Rescue mission.

14:24.541 --> 14:27.458
I wasn't supposed to land here.
I was aiming for 2018.

14:27.541 --> 14:31.125
-I need to get there as soon as possible.
-Who were you trying to save in 2018?

14:31.208 --> 14:32.125
Really?

14:32.208 --> 14:34.708
Fine. Can you at least tell me
how you got here?

14:34.791 --> 14:35.750
I'll show ya.

14:37.250 --> 14:38.625
[whooshing]

14:38.708 --> 14:40.041
[power crackles and fades]

14:40.125 --> 14:41.125
What was that?

14:42.250 --> 14:44.458
-Crap.
-What?

14:44.541 --> 14:47.875
Uh, we're gonna switch to plan A,
which is where you come in.

14:47.958 --> 14:50.250
You see, time jets,
like all tech in the future,

14:50.333 --> 14:52.333
is coded to its user's DNA.

14:52.416 --> 14:55.875
Because I'm injured… aah,
the jet won't even clear me to fly,

14:55.958 --> 14:57.875
which means
I can't get in there to fix her.

14:57.958 --> 14:59.458
But guess who can?

15:04.375 --> 15:05.541
[whirring]

15:05.625 --> 15:06.833
[power building]

15:06.916 --> 15:09.083
[engine humming]

15:11.125 --> 15:13.583
There she is.

15:13.666 --> 15:15.208
[dramatic music playing]

15:30.458 --> 15:32.708
[Adam] Away we go.

15:50.875 --> 15:53.208
Okay. Sit down.

15:53.291 --> 15:55.083
-Oh my God.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sit down.

15:56.083 --> 15:59.750
Let's see what we're dealing with here.
All right, some minor shield damage.

16:00.625 --> 16:02.500
-Coolant leaks.
-[beeping]

16:02.583 --> 16:05.750
I don't know what that is, but when
is a flashing red light ever good?

16:05.833 --> 16:06.875
Ah-da-da-da-da-da.

16:06.958 --> 16:09.333
I know you wanna touch
all the pretty buttons

16:09.416 --> 16:13.750
with your sticky little child fingers,
but the reactor has a quantum signature.

16:13.833 --> 16:15.791
You fire it up, they can find us.

16:16.541 --> 16:17.666
If they're here.

16:17.750 --> 16:18.666
Who are "they"?

16:18.750 --> 16:21.958
I'm glad that you didn't ask me that
because "they" are classified.

16:22.041 --> 16:25.208
-I already know you're from the future.
-Believe me, I regret that.

16:25.291 --> 16:28.875
I had no intention of coming back
to revisit… this.

16:29.625 --> 16:31.291
Jesus. Okay.

16:31.375 --> 16:32.500
[chiming]

16:32.583 --> 16:34.958
Okay, I've isolated the damaged relays,

16:35.458 --> 16:39.125
so the ship should be able
to start repairing itself.

16:39.208 --> 16:40.541
How long will that take?

16:40.625 --> 16:42.000
Ah, it's at 50% capacity,

16:42.083 --> 16:44.708
so hopefully less time
than it takes me to heal.

16:44.791 --> 16:45.708
[young Adam] Wait.

16:46.750 --> 16:49.458
-Do you remember this?
-Remember what?

16:49.541 --> 16:51.250
This. Right here, right now.

16:51.333 --> 16:53.000
You being here in 2022?

16:53.083 --> 16:55.583
-Know where you're going with this.
-If this is happening to me--

16:55.666 --> 16:58.250
-You're wasting your time.
-That means it already happened to you.

16:58.333 --> 16:59.958
Unless it works like a multiverse,

17:00.041 --> 17:01.833
where each ripple creates
an alternate timeline--

17:01.916 --> 17:03.125
It's not a multiverse!

17:03.208 --> 17:05.500
My God, we watched too many movies.

17:05.583 --> 17:06.833
I just wanna know.

17:07.541 --> 17:08.625
[sighs]

17:09.833 --> 17:10.791
Okay.

17:12.125 --> 17:16.083
Okay, the prevailing wisdom
is that when I go back to my fixed time,

17:16.750 --> 17:20.291
my memory… our memories,
they reform, they reconcile.

17:21.250 --> 17:23.708
-But not while I'm here.
-Fixed time? What's that?

17:23.791 --> 17:27.333
There's only one place in time
where you belong on a quantum level,

17:27.416 --> 17:30.166
where you're not screwing around
with the cosmos like I am.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.500
That is your fixed time.

17:33.166 --> 17:34.500
Where you actually belong.

17:35.416 --> 17:37.833
So by being here and telling me this,

17:37.916 --> 17:40.416
you may have just changed my whole future?

17:41.083 --> 17:43.625
Honestly? Your future
is pretty tragic either way.

17:43.708 --> 17:46.166
[laughs] I'm kidding! I'm kidding.

17:46.250 --> 17:47.166
I'm not kidding.

17:48.250 --> 17:51.083
I'm kidding. Let's go.
Come on. Here we go.

17:51.666 --> 17:53.250
[young Adam] So what happens now?

17:53.333 --> 17:56.458
Nothin'. I'm just gonna lay down.
Let this bullet wound heal.

17:56.541 --> 17:59.833
Think about some key
investment opportunities for your future.

17:59.916 --> 18:02.958
-Wait, like Biff from Back to the--
-Are you out of your tiny mind?

18:03.041 --> 18:06.708
Get back in the house before our mother
gets home, and don't make it weird.

18:06.791 --> 18:07.875
-[sniffles]
-Hey.

18:08.458 --> 18:09.375
[frustratedly] Yes?

18:10.375 --> 18:12.833
-This is amazing.
-Isn't it, though?

18:15.083 --> 18:16.958

18:47.791 --> 18:50.750
Oh, hey. I'm surprised you're still up.

18:50.833 --> 18:53.458
Well, this night's been
full of surprises, mother.

18:53.541 --> 18:54.750
That's chilling. What happened?

18:55.333 --> 18:59.166
How was your not-a-date?
Will you be seeing him again?

18:59.250 --> 19:01.583
-No. I don't know. I don't think so.
-[knocking at door]

19:06.041 --> 19:07.208
-Hi.
-Hi.

19:07.291 --> 19:08.875
-Me again.
-Yes, it is.

19:08.958 --> 19:10.583
You left your scarf in my car.

19:10.666 --> 19:13.250
-I did. Gosh, thanks.
-[Derek] Oh, hey there, kiddo.

19:13.333 --> 19:17.083
Oh. This is my son, Adam.
Adam, this is Derek.

19:17.166 --> 19:18.208
Oh, hey, Adam.

19:18.291 --> 19:21.583
Hello. You have a wonderful mouth mullet.
You must be very proud.

19:21.666 --> 19:23.000
Oh my gosh, Adam. [laughs]

19:23.083 --> 19:26.250
-Never heard it called that before.
-Well, thanks again.

19:26.333 --> 19:27.333
Sure. See you soon.

19:27.416 --> 19:29.541
Unlikely, but I'll put in
a good word for you.

19:29.625 --> 19:32.791
Okay. Okay. I'll see you at work.

19:32.875 --> 19:33.833
-[Derek] Yeah.
-Bye.

19:35.916 --> 19:36.791
[Ellie sighs]

19:37.416 --> 19:38.458
He seems nice.

19:39.333 --> 19:40.458
What?

19:41.833 --> 19:43.750
You can be a real jerk sometimes.

19:44.500 --> 19:45.458
You know that? [sighs]

20:21.750 --> 20:23.375
[sighs]

20:25.750 --> 20:27.458
Hey there. Good morning.

20:28.083 --> 20:29.583
Shouldn't you be at work?

20:29.666 --> 20:32.416
Yeah, I need to pay the insurance
on the house today.

20:32.500 --> 20:35.666
Had it in the calendar,
but I can't find the statement.

20:35.750 --> 20:37.375
[Adam] With that filing system?

20:38.125 --> 20:40.416
Shocking. It should all be online.

20:41.625 --> 20:43.791
The minute I find myself
with a few extra hours,

20:43.875 --> 20:45.791
I will set up those accounts.

20:45.875 --> 20:47.916
Until then, this is how your dad did it.

20:48.625 --> 20:50.000
Hey, grab a pile.

20:50.083 --> 20:53.041
Sorry. I gotta get to my room
to think about what I've done.

20:55.083 --> 20:56.166
Okay.

20:56.250 --> 20:57.166
I gotta go.

20:58.250 --> 20:59.625
Call me if you need me.

And somehow, you ended up in 2022.
How does that work? You just missed?

24:01.500 --> 24:04.166

when I was stealing the plane.

I didn't have time to double-check 'em.

-Wait, you stole the jet?
-It's encoded to me.

24:12.750 --> 24:15.791
So I didn't exactly steal it.
I borrowed the shit out of it.

24:26.458 --> 24:28.666
[muzak version
of "Time After Time" playing]

24:39.458 --> 24:42.041
[Chuck laughs] What's up, Reed?

24:43.375 --> 24:44.250
Crap.

24:45.041 --> 24:48.458
Well, look who we have here.

24:48.541 --> 24:52.375
Ray, can we just take a break
from the ass kicking today?

24:52.458 --> 24:54.833
I have a lot going on.

24:55.416 --> 24:58.083
Hey, guys. Enjoying our suspension?

24:58.166 --> 24:59.208
I am now.

24:59.291 --> 25:01.208
[young Adam groans] That's my spleen.

25:01.291 --> 25:02.166
[Adam laughs]

25:02.250 --> 25:04.166
I remember these little turd-burpers.

25:04.250 --> 25:08.083
-Hey, man, we're, uh… just playin' around.
-Quiet, Ray. This isn't about you.

25:09.000 --> 25:09.833
Chuck.

25:10.791 --> 25:13.250
Hey, what's goin' on? Huh?

25:13.750 --> 25:16.416
Get it together. Ray's ready.
You're embarrassing yourself.

25:16.500 --> 25:18.166
So you're not gonna break this up?

25:18.250 --> 25:20.458
God, no. That'd be irresponsible of me.

25:20.541 --> 25:23.708
You'll just figure out some other way
to pound the crap out of him.

25:23.791 --> 25:24.708
You always do.

25:24.791 --> 25:26.708
He's got a big mouth. I get it.

25:26.791 --> 25:29.291
Point is, this fight needs
to happen right now.

25:29.375 --> 25:31.166
So just give us a second, okay, Ray?

25:31.250 --> 25:33.291
Stretch out. You don't wanna pull a hammy.

25:33.375 --> 25:34.458
What are you doing?

25:34.541 --> 25:36.958
Hey, Ray Dollarhyde has been bullying you
for years

25:37.041 --> 25:40.041
because you're small, and fragile,
and you have a big mouth.

25:40.125 --> 25:42.291
But here's the thing.
He doesn't wanna fight.

25:42.375 --> 25:44.833
-I don't wanna fight either.
-He doesn't know that, does he?

25:44.916 --> 25:48.250
So you're gonna walk over there,
and you're gonna raise your hands,

25:48.333 --> 25:51.458
and then you're gonna look Ray
right in the eye.

25:53.083 --> 25:54.833
You're gonna smile in a way that says,

25:54.916 --> 25:56.916
"I've waited my entire life
for this moment."

25:57.000 --> 26:01.583
Like you can't wait
to watch his soul exit his body.

26:01.666 --> 26:03.291
Then you're gonna drop to your knees

26:03.375 --> 26:05.750
and punch him hard
in the private bathing suit parts.

26:05.833 --> 26:08.333
-I'm sorry, the what now?
-Ah! Are we gonna smoke this banana?

26:08.416 --> 26:11.583
Or are we gonna talk about it all day?
Let's go, go, go, go, go.

26:14.333 --> 26:17.583
I'm gonna smoke your banana, motherf--

26:17.666 --> 26:20.625
No, no, no, no! No. That…
that's not what we talked about.

26:21.750 --> 26:23.041
[young Adam grunts]

26:23.125 --> 26:24.458
[groans]

26:24.541 --> 26:26.000
-[groans]
-[Ray] Boom!

26:26.083 --> 26:27.291
[laughing] Oh yeah!

26:27.375 --> 26:29.416
-[Chuck] Nice, man.
-[Ray] You crying, Reed?

26:29.500 --> 26:31.666
Oh no, Chuck. Look, we made him cry.

26:31.750 --> 26:33.750
[Chuck] It's like he was trying to lose.

26:34.250 --> 26:35.750
Run away, Reed!

26:36.958 --> 26:38.833
-What the hell?
-I'm not supposed to do this.

26:38.916 --> 26:41.375
Ever hear the expression,
"Every bully has a bully"?

26:41.958 --> 26:44.708
Yours isn't holding up his end
of the bargain, so I'm gonna take over.

26:44.791 --> 26:46.333
-What are you talking about?
-[shushes]

26:46.416 --> 26:49.208
You're a good fighter.
You like to kick ass. You're a big kid.

26:49.291 --> 26:53.208
But if you go near Adam again,
I'll know, and I will find you, Ray.

26:53.291 --> 26:56.541
And it won't be like a couple of kids
in a playground scrap.

26:56.625 --> 26:58.583
I will pull bones out of your body.

26:58.666 --> 26:59.833
I will sharpen them.

26:59.916 --> 27:02.833
-I will use them to stab little Chuckie.
-What did I do?

27:02.916 --> 27:05.375
Shut your mouth,
or I'll fill it with Ray's feet.

27:06.708 --> 27:08.958
You understand what I'm saying?
Got all of it? The bones?

27:09.041 --> 27:10.458
-Yeah.
-Your feet in Chuckie's mouth?

27:10.541 --> 27:12.625
-[liquid running]
-Good. Are you peeing right now?

27:12.708 --> 27:14.375
-Yeah.
-You're a real streamer.

27:14.458 --> 27:17.250
Get yourself home and clean yourself up.

27:17.333 --> 27:19.541
Be the change you wanna see, okay?

27:25.333 --> 27:27.041
God, I hated those assholes.

27:31.208 --> 27:33.208
[birdsong]

27:50.125 --> 27:51.541
Oh, come on.

27:52.041 --> 27:53.000
Hey, Adam.

27:55.083 --> 27:57.541
Get out of my stuff and open the door.

27:58.166 --> 28:00.125
Put the drone down. It will kill us both.

28:00.208 --> 28:03.583
Hey, look, you lost one fight.
I figured you'd be used to that by now.

28:03.666 --> 28:06.083
You coulda helped. You just stood there.

28:06.791 --> 28:08.375
Christ. You're so sensitive.

28:08.458 --> 28:10.375
Hey, you had to lose that fight.

28:11.416 --> 28:12.875
You had to. Trust me.

28:13.958 --> 28:17.625
You don't go from bein' you to bein' me
without gettin' your ass kicked,

28:17.708 --> 28:19.500
a lot, all the time.

28:23.958 --> 28:25.958
I'm sorry if I went too far today.

28:27.208 --> 28:28.458
Shouldn't have done that.

28:30.166 --> 28:32.250
-[young Adam] Who's this?
-Who's who?

28:35.291 --> 28:36.250
Put that back.

28:37.166 --> 28:38.250
You put that back.

28:38.333 --> 28:40.083
As soon as you tell me who she is.

28:42.625 --> 28:44.916
That's my wife, Laura.

28:45.541 --> 28:46.791
We have a wife?

28:48.625 --> 28:50.916
No, we do not have a wife anymore.

29:13.708 --> 29:14.625
-[Ellie] Hey.
-Hi.

29:15.625 --> 29:18.208
-[man] Aah. Hi, there. How are you?
-Hey, Paul.

29:19.416 --> 29:20.250
[Paul] Been a while.

29:20.333 --> 29:23.291
[Ellie] Yep, how you doin'?
That baby sleeping yet?

29:23.375 --> 29:24.875
Uh, not really. No.

29:24.958 --> 29:27.541
[chuckles] No. Well, you'll miss
those days when they're gone.

29:27.625 --> 29:29.208
Ah, I find that hard to believe.

29:29.291 --> 29:32.541
[Ellie] Believe it. Babies are pure love.

29:32.625 --> 29:36.291
They grow into teenagers,
who grow into be assassins of happiness.

29:36.375 --> 29:37.583
Thank you, thank you.

29:37.666 --> 29:40.708
Mm, well,
somethin' to look forward to. [chuckles]

29:40.791 --> 29:42.958
Sorry. It's been a rough day.

29:43.833 --> 29:45.833
Year. Couple of years.

29:45.916 --> 29:48.375
Hmm. Your boy still havin' a hard time?

29:48.458 --> 29:49.875
[sighs]

29:49.958 --> 29:51.291
He hates me.

29:52.500 --> 29:53.333
[Paul] Hmm.

29:53.416 --> 29:56.958
It's not his fault.
He's… he's just dealing.

29:57.041 --> 30:00.291
It's fine. We'll be fine.
It's good. Good, good, good.

30:02.416 --> 30:04.125
I wish I knew what I was doin' wrong.

30:04.208 --> 30:05.708
You're not doin' anything wrong.

30:07.208 --> 30:08.208
Sorry. [laughs]

30:08.291 --> 30:10.166
-I'm sorry.
-[laughing] Sorry, you scared me.

30:10.250 --> 30:12.208
-I was eavesdropping. I'm sorry.
-Yeah.

30:12.291 --> 30:14.875
[chuckles] You're right, though.
Teenage boys are horrible.

30:15.625 --> 30:18.458
It's like living with a urinal cake
that yells at you.

30:18.541 --> 30:19.625
[laughs]

30:19.708 --> 30:21.916
Mothers are usually the ones
who take the hit.

30:22.625 --> 30:23.458
Yeah.

30:24.541 --> 30:26.833
-But I'll tell you somethin'.
-Mmm?

30:28.000 --> 30:30.125
Boys always come back for their mamas.

30:34.500 --> 30:35.666
That's nice.

30:36.291 --> 30:38.750
It sounds like
you're speaking from experience.

30:39.500 --> 30:40.416
I am.

30:41.250 --> 30:42.458
You have a good mom?

30:42.541 --> 30:44.083
-[Adam] I do.
-Oh.

30:44.166 --> 30:45.791
[whispers] I have the best mom.

30:48.458 --> 30:49.416
Good.

30:51.125 --> 30:52.333
I hope you're right.

30:53.333 --> 30:56.583
I'm still researching boarding schools
in Fallujah, so…

30:56.666 --> 30:58.333
-Good.
-[both laugh]

30:59.208 --> 31:02.291
No, I don't mean that.
He's such a sweet kid.

31:02.375 --> 31:04.000
I'm crazy about him.

31:04.791 --> 31:07.958
We lost his dad in a car accident
year before last.

31:08.041 --> 31:10.625
Yeah. That's tough.

31:10.708 --> 31:12.541
Yeah. You have no idea.

31:13.583 --> 31:14.958
Well, I have some idea.

31:15.041 --> 31:17.333
-Oh, sorry.
-Sorry.

31:18.625 --> 31:19.458
Jinx.

31:20.416 --> 31:22.125
-Thank you.
-[Adam] Thank you.

31:28.708 --> 31:30.291
Aren't you grieving too?

31:35.000 --> 31:36.166
-Yeah.
-[Adam] Yeah.

31:36.250 --> 31:38.416
I am. Of course I am.

31:40.208 --> 31:41.458
So tell him.

31:42.083 --> 31:43.291
You should tell him.

31:45.583 --> 31:47.000
I don't think he needs it.

31:47.083 --> 31:48.750
You think you're being strong for him,

31:49.333 --> 31:52.458
and the problem with acting
like you have it all together is…

31:52.541 --> 31:53.791
he believes it.

32:00.916 --> 32:03.166
Maybe he needs to know that you don't.

32:04.791 --> 32:06.166
It's okay if you don't.

32:12.250 --> 32:13.666
[Adam chuckles]

32:15.791 --> 32:18.250
My husband had a jacket just like that.

32:18.875 --> 32:20.500
Oh, this is a classic.

32:24.333 --> 32:25.208
Yeah.

32:25.291 --> 32:28.625
It was really nice chatting with you.
I'll see you later.

32:29.833 --> 32:30.916
Oh, hey, um…

32:32.125 --> 32:33.375
he doesn't hate you.

32:34.750 --> 32:35.875
He loves you.

32:37.333 --> 32:38.458
More than he knows.

32:50.375 --> 32:51.958
Hey! Hey!

32:52.625 --> 32:54.541
[breathing heavily]

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
[engines rumbling]

33:15.041 --> 33:16.541
[bleeping]

33:17.041 --> 33:18.125
Locked and docked.

33:18.708 --> 33:20.750
Start the area scans for his jet.

33:21.250 --> 33:22.875
Let's find him
and get the hell outta here.

33:23.791 --> 33:25.083
[stomps]

33:25.958 --> 33:26.916
Find him.

33:28.250 --> 33:30.250
[cutlery clinking]

33:36.250 --> 33:39.500
-So you came back for your wife, Laura?
-We're not getting into that.

33:39.583 --> 33:40.958
Hey, she's my wife too.

33:41.041 --> 33:43.708
-You know what? We should get into that.
-Thank you.

33:46.666 --> 33:48.208
Met in the academy.

33:48.291 --> 33:51.333
She was 20 minutes late
to the wrong classroom

33:52.083 --> 33:53.208
in the wrong building.

33:55.125 --> 33:57.333
I offered to walk her
to the right one, and…

33:58.208 --> 34:00.916
man, I was all in
before we even made it outside.

34:01.000 --> 34:04.708
A couple of years ago,
she didn't come back from a jump.

34:06.083 --> 34:10.375
They told me her jet broke up on reentry,
but she was the best pilot in the program.

34:10.875 --> 34:14.000
She wrote the book on reentry.
Didn't make sense.

34:14.083 --> 34:18.291
And you were trying to get to 2018
'cause that's where she went before?

34:18.375 --> 34:19.541
Yeah.

34:19.625 --> 34:22.083
-What was she doing there?
-I don't know.

34:22.166 --> 34:23.791
They changed the jump logs.

34:23.875 --> 34:25.458
Somebody was hidin' somethin'.

34:25.958 --> 34:28.666
Maybe she saw something
Sorian didn't want her to see.

34:28.750 --> 34:31.333
Wait, "Sorian"?
Maya Sorian, Dad's partner?

34:31.416 --> 34:33.208
-She was always so nice to me.
-Hmm.

34:33.291 --> 34:36.083
Yeah, trust me. She's no friend.

34:36.166 --> 34:37.000
Nope.

34:37.500 --> 34:39.791
After Dad died,
she got rich off of his tech.

34:40.708 --> 34:42.333
Bought all the right people.

34:43.208 --> 34:44.083
Next thing you know,

34:44.166 --> 34:47.583
she has exclusive control
over the most valuable resource on Earth,

34:48.375 --> 34:49.208
time.

34:49.791 --> 34:54.416
Wait a minute.
You're saying Dad invented time travel?

34:54.500 --> 34:55.333
Yeah.

34:55.916 --> 34:57.000
Not on purpose.

34:58.208 --> 35:01.041
The magnetic particle accelerator.
Remember that?

35:01.125 --> 35:02.500
He called it The Adam Project.

35:02.583 --> 35:05.333
[Adam] Yeah, or as I like to call it,
his favorite child.

35:06.541 --> 35:08.083
So what happened to Laura?

35:08.833 --> 35:12.166
Mmm. Well, I think your nice friend Maya
had her killed.

35:12.250 --> 35:14.000
-What?
-Yeah.

35:14.083 --> 35:16.416
That's why I gotta get back to 2018
as soon as possible.

35:16.500 --> 35:18.625
The jet's almost ready.
I'll lay low in the shed.

35:18.708 --> 35:21.333
I'll heal for a few more days
until I can get a clean read

35:21.416 --> 35:22.791
and then fly out of your life.

35:22.875 --> 35:24.791
But going back to save her.

35:24.875 --> 35:26.291
-Talking to me.
-[whines]

35:26.375 --> 35:29.958
Everything you're doing right now
just to rescue one person.

35:30.041 --> 35:33.125
You're changing the future.
That's gotta be against the rules.

35:33.208 --> 35:35.291
You'll feel differently when you meet her.

35:35.375 --> 35:36.958
[rattling]

35:37.041 --> 35:39.125
-And when you lose her.
-What?

35:39.208 --> 35:42.875
[shushes] Grab that bag. Get ready to run.

35:42.958 --> 35:44.416
Why? What's happening?

35:45.583 --> 35:47.791
We're going that way. Be ready.

35:49.458 --> 35:51.083
[whirrs]

35:56.875 --> 35:58.083
[whooshing]

36:03.000 --> 36:04.375
-[crackling]
-[groaning]

36:05.208 --> 36:06.583
-Move!
-[whooshing]

36:07.375 --> 36:08.916
[Adam grunting]

36:22.041 --> 36:23.666
[groaning]

36:23.750 --> 36:24.791
[grunts]

36:26.166 --> 36:29.000
Stay behind me. [exhales]

36:29.083 --> 36:31.625
Don't you do it! Don't you do it, Reed!

36:31.708 --> 36:33.041
Wanna see something cool?

36:33.125 --> 36:34.333
[clanking and whirring]

36:35.541 --> 36:37.541
-That's a lightsaber, dude.
-Quiet now.

Laura, is that you?

49:49.833 --> 49:52.875
You're not still mad at me
for blowing up your jet, are you?

49:53.375 --> 49:56.833
If I'm being honest,
yeah, I'm still kinda pissed.

50:07.291 --> 50:09.250
Will you stop and listen to me?

50:09.333 --> 50:11.958
This is my fixed time.
You already had my childhood.

50:12.041 --> 50:13.875
You had adventures, you flew planes,

50:13.958 --> 50:17.000
and I'm still the nerd with an inhaler
who gets his ass kicked.

50:17.083 --> 50:18.083
I want the rest of it.

50:18.166 --> 50:19.291
-Want the rest?
-Yeah.

50:19.375 --> 50:23.250
Here's the rest of it. Dad's death
screws you up more than you ever realize.

50:23.333 --> 50:24.958
You get depressed. You get angry.

50:25.041 --> 50:27.625
You wander around school
without making a social dent.

50:27.708 --> 50:30.875
College is a high point, until
after a year, you lose your scholarship

50:30.958 --> 50:33.708
for something
that is so unbelievably stupid

50:33.791 --> 50:35.958
I cannot even say it out loud right now.

50:36.041 --> 50:39.458
You end up in the air force.
Turns out you could really fly.

50:39.541 --> 50:42.958
And then along comes time travel,
and the whole world starts to fall apart

50:43.041 --> 50:44.583
until the only woman you have…

50:44.666 --> 50:47.000
the only woman you ever loved
gets taken away.

50:47.083 --> 50:48.458

What's your plan?

51:12.375 --> 51:14.958
I'm not gonna explain my plan
to a nerd with an inhaler--

51:15.041 --> 51:17.125
-You don't have a plan.
-Because I do not have a plan.

51:17.208 --> 51:18.208
-Exactly.
-That is correct.

51:18.291 --> 51:20.416

for time travel.

1:02:02.291 --> 1:02:03.625
That part's theoretical.

1:02:03.708 --> 1:02:04.750
-Right.
-Still theoretical.

1:02:04.833 --> 1:02:06.916
This theory needs to take a leak.
So let's go.

1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:10.666
Holy shit!
I'm the godfather of time travel?

1:02:12.166 --> 1:02:13.708
Nice hit, Dad.

1:02:13.791 --> 1:02:15.666
[whispers] I think I broke my hand.

1:02:19.041 --> 1:02:21.250
[Louis] I'm… I'm sorry. This is my fault.

1:02:21.333 --> 1:02:23.250
My… my ego. My hubris.

1:02:23.333 --> 1:02:26.625
My need to be best, to be first,
to be the smartest guy in the room.

1:02:26.708 --> 1:02:27.541
And here we are.

1:02:27.625 --> 1:02:29.666
-A disgusting character flaw.
-He didn't know.

1:02:29.750 --> 1:02:31.416
-[Louis] But I should have.
-Yeah.

1:02:31.500 --> 1:02:35.458
Mankind has no business tampering
with the mechanics of the universe.

1:02:35.541 --> 1:02:37.541
There are forces greater than science.

1:02:37.625 --> 1:02:40.083
Right. That's why we're gonna
put the genie back in the bottle.

1:02:40.166 --> 1:02:42.833
Destroy time travel
before it's even invented.

1:02:42.916 --> 1:02:43.791
Uh--

1:02:44.291 --> 1:02:47.083
What's done, no matter how terrible,

1:02:47.166 --> 1:02:50.583
should not and cannot be undone
under any circumstance.

1:02:50.666 --> 1:02:54.250
Even us being here, talking like this,
we're perverting fate and time.

1:02:54.333 --> 1:02:57.708
I told you Sorian already did that.
She's had the world by the balls since.

1:02:57.791 --> 1:02:59.250
And you know that for a fact?

1:02:59.333 --> 1:03:01.958
Do you have scientific proof
that she changed things?

1:03:02.041 --> 1:03:05.250
No, you don't because you can't know.
But I will tell you this.

1:03:05.333 --> 1:03:10.250
You being here opens up the potential
for catastrophic reconfiguration.

1:03:10.333 --> 1:03:12.666
-And that is quantifiable, that--
-Stop. Stop.

1:03:12.750 --> 1:03:13.958
-Stop.
-Stop what?

1:03:14.041 --> 1:03:16.166
-Stop being a scientist.
-But I am a scient--

1:03:16.250 --> 1:03:17.166
Be a father.

1:03:19.625 --> 1:03:22.500
You were always more interested
in the universe than your son.

1:03:22.583 --> 1:03:24.000
-That's not true.
-[Adam] That is true.

1:03:24.083 --> 1:03:26.375
And when you're older,
you'll realize that. It--

1:03:26.458 --> 1:03:27.708
You know what? It's…

1:03:28.916 --> 1:03:32.750
That ship has sailed. It's too late
for me. So, you know, whatever. I'm fine.

1:03:33.583 --> 1:03:34.875
But he needs you.

1:03:39.583 --> 1:03:40.458
[Louis] Hmm.

1:03:42.041 --> 1:03:43.583
And you? What do you need?

1:03:47.666 --> 1:03:48.875
[chuckles]

1:03:51.541 --> 1:03:53.083
I need to go for a walk.

1:03:58.500 --> 1:03:59.875
[door opens]

1:04:07.458 --> 1:04:09.833
I can't be here, Adam. I… I have to go.

1:04:11.166 --> 1:04:12.875
-Please don't go.
-I have to.

1:04:12.958 --> 1:04:15.125
-Please.
-This is… this is bigger than any of us.

1:04:15.208 --> 1:04:17.916
It's too dangerous
what he's asking me to do. I can't.

1:04:24.083 --> 1:04:26.500
All right. We'll see each other again.

1:04:31.166 --> 1:04:32.166
Wait.

1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:39.041
-I need to tell you something.
-No, you can't say anything else to me.

1:04:39.125 --> 1:04:40.958
I can't know the future.

1:04:42.666 --> 1:04:43.708
I'm sorry.

1:04:44.333 --> 1:04:47.333
I have to go home.
Your mom and you are waiting.

1:05:02.375 --> 1:05:03.541
[woman] Yes, Senator.

1:05:03.625 --> 1:05:07.375
Except the stability of these wormholes
is no longer a hypothetical,

1:05:07.458 --> 1:05:11.708
and the work we are doing here
is simply ahead of the current statutes.

1:05:11.791 --> 1:05:15.625
So you can either support my program
and be a part of the future,

1:05:15.708 --> 1:05:17.875
or you can get left behind in the past.

1:05:17.958 --> 1:05:19.333
[Sorian] Hang up the phone.

1:05:23.208 --> 1:05:26.625
What are you doing here?
You said I wouldn't be seeing you again.

1:05:26.708 --> 1:05:28.208
Did I? Hmm.

1:05:28.875 --> 1:05:30.250
When was that? Remind me.

1:05:30.333 --> 1:05:33.541
[Maya] The last time
you just showed up, two months ago.

1:05:33.625 --> 1:05:37.541
Oh, well, for me, it was 32 years ago.

1:05:37.625 --> 1:05:40.291
So sorry if I'm a little fuzzy
on the details.

1:05:40.375 --> 1:05:43.583
Anyway, times have changed.

1:05:43.666 --> 1:05:44.958
You can't be here.

1:05:45.041 --> 1:05:49.125
You know the potential for
catastrophic changes to the time stream.

1:05:49.208 --> 1:05:50.875
-It's incalculable.
-God, I was such a nerd.

1:05:50.958 --> 1:05:52.416
Will you please just stop talking?

1:05:52.500 --> 1:05:53.875
Everything you asked me to do.

1:05:53.958 --> 1:05:58.000
The stock buys, the offshore accounts,
all of it. It's unethical.

1:05:58.083 --> 1:06:01.666
-And illegal.
-This isn't a joke. It's dangerous.

1:06:01.750 --> 1:06:06.000
The environmental impact alone
from the companies you had me pick

1:06:06.083 --> 1:06:07.458
could be devastating.

1:06:07.541 --> 1:06:08.625
In fairness to us,

1:06:08.708 --> 1:06:11.375
the environment was pretty much toast
before we came along.

1:06:11.458 --> 1:06:14.583
And by the way, Maya,
you did it, all of it,

1:06:14.666 --> 1:06:19.916
because somewhere inside that cheap suit
and ridiculous ponytail is me.

1:06:22.375 --> 1:06:23.375
I'm leaving.

1:06:23.875 --> 1:06:24.791
Where you going?

1:06:26.625 --> 1:06:27.708
You seeing someone?

1:06:28.500 --> 1:06:31.041
No, you're not. You're too busy.

1:06:31.541 --> 1:06:33.750
[clicks tongue] Thing is,
you always will be.

1:06:34.750 --> 1:06:37.041
This company is all you will ever have.

1:06:37.125 --> 1:06:38.916
-[sighs]
-It is your personal life.

1:06:39.875 --> 1:06:41.083
It's your family.

1:06:42.500 --> 1:06:43.916
But this is our legacy.

1:06:46.750 --> 1:06:50.166
And if we had let the government
take it from us,

1:06:50.250 --> 1:06:52.458
then everything we sacrificed,

1:06:53.166 --> 1:06:55.291
all that loneliness,

1:06:56.791 --> 1:06:58.208
all that loneliness,

1:06:59.458 --> 1:07:00.708
would've been for nothing.

1:07:01.583 --> 1:07:02.916
And I did it.

1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:07.708
I fixed that future
where we had been forgotten.

1:07:09.625 --> 1:07:11.458
Then why are you back here now?

1:07:12.541 --> 1:07:13.583
I'm back

1:07:14.458 --> 1:07:17.791
because we can't control time travel
if it never existed.

1:07:17.875 --> 1:07:21.291
And your buddy Adam Reed
is about to betray you.

1:07:21.375 --> 1:07:23.625
Adam? He's just a little kid.

1:07:24.791 --> 1:07:26.791
Yeah, well, that little kid…

1:07:26.875 --> 1:07:30.000
[laughs] …he grows up
to be a very big pain in our ass.

1:07:30.625 --> 1:07:33.458
[sighs] Trust me. You're gonna want this.

1:07:36.375 --> 1:07:38.375
[crickets chirping]

1:07:40.833 --> 1:07:42.208
[door opens]

1:07:43.958 --> 1:07:45.208
[door closes]

1:07:54.875 --> 1:07:55.750
What?

1:07:56.750 --> 1:07:59.458
I know you think you know more than me
because you're older.

1:07:59.541 --> 1:08:01.291
Go away, Adam. [sighs]

1:08:02.125 --> 1:08:03.958
And I know why you hate him so much.

1:08:05.916 --> 1:08:06.750
Really?

1:08:07.333 --> 1:08:10.208
[laughs] Well, do tell.
I'm on the edge of my seat here.

1:08:11.125 --> 1:08:14.083
Holy shit. I wonder what it i--
Was it because he's narcissistic,

1:08:14.166 --> 1:08:16.375
or, uh, never came home from work

1:08:16.458 --> 1:08:18.208
or cared more about his job than his son--

1:08:18.291 --> 1:08:19.541
It's because he died.

1:08:22.291 --> 1:08:23.333
You hate him

1:08:24.666 --> 1:08:25.666
because he died.

1:08:28.791 --> 1:08:31.083
You made yourself hate him

1:08:32.125 --> 1:08:34.083
because it was easier than missing him.

1:08:34.833 --> 1:08:37.458
And I remember some stuff
that you maybe don't wanna.

1:08:37.541 --> 1:08:38.458
Oh yeah?

1:08:39.583 --> 1:08:40.541
Like what?

1:08:41.333 --> 1:08:42.708
He played catch with us

1:08:43.750 --> 1:08:45.166
almost every night.

1:08:45.250 --> 1:08:46.208
Catch.

1:08:46.750 --> 1:08:48.083
He'd get home from work,

1:08:48.958 --> 1:08:53.875
be so tired, and I'd be in the yard
throwing the ball against the pitch back.

1:08:53.958 --> 1:08:57.333
-You remember the pitch back, right?
-Oh, I… I remember the pitch back.

1:08:57.416 --> 1:09:00.125
Yeah, he bought it
so he didn't have to play with me.

1:09:00.208 --> 1:09:01.083
Nope.

1:09:03.083 --> 1:09:06.250
He bought it because they had one
in the window of Altman's.

1:09:08.875 --> 1:09:11.583
And every time we passed that store,

1:09:11.666 --> 1:09:14.083
I begged him to buy it for me,

1:09:14.166 --> 1:09:15.625
so that's what Dad did.

1:09:16.958 --> 1:09:21.333
He'd see me throwin' in the yard,
and no matter how tired he was,

1:09:21.416 --> 1:09:24.541
he'd always grab his mitt
to come out for a catch.

1:09:26.083 --> 1:09:28.625
Things happened to you, to us.

1:09:30.291 --> 1:09:32.541
And we suck at dealing with it.

1:09:33.750 --> 1:09:35.416
I'm starting to think
it's something we do.

1:09:35.500 --> 1:09:37.375
I give Mom a hard time now, and…

1:09:39.333 --> 1:09:40.375
I think…

1:09:43.208 --> 1:09:45.833
I think it's easier to be angry
than it is to be sad.

1:09:47.041 --> 1:09:49.375
And I guess, when I get older,

1:09:50.791 --> 1:09:52.583
I forget that there's a difference.

1:09:58.458 --> 1:10:00.291
How'd you get to be so smart?

1:10:00.375 --> 1:10:02.291
How'd you get to be so dumb?

1:10:12.125 --> 1:10:13.416
[sighs]

1:10:20.541 --> 1:10:21.708
Nice try, asshole.

1:10:23.208 --> 1:10:26.666
[Ellie] Adam, make sure you feed Hawking
before you leave for school, honey.

1:10:27.416 --> 1:10:28.666
-Oh.
-[sizzling]

1:10:28.750 --> 1:10:30.500
-You're still here.
-[Louis] Oh.

1:10:30.583 --> 1:10:32.500
And you're cooking.
What are you making? Hi.

1:10:32.583 --> 1:10:34.625
Uh, I know you like the Denver omelet.

1:10:35.458 --> 1:10:38.583
That's not a Denver omelet.
That is a cry for help.

1:10:38.666 --> 1:10:41.625
The eggs are burnt, and the bacon's
still somehow totally raw.

1:10:41.708 --> 1:10:43.666
Oh, you… Oh, no, no. No, no, no. Wha--

1:10:43.750 --> 1:10:45.833
Do you wanna talk about
why you're still here

1:10:45.916 --> 1:10:47.291
instead of being at work?

1:10:47.375 --> 1:10:50.583
I… I… Well, I just wanted to stay home
with you today.

1:10:51.250 --> 1:10:54.291
You don't say. I like this guy.

1:10:54.958 --> 1:10:56.041
This guy likes you.

1:10:58.208 --> 1:10:59.958
What's going on with you, honey?

1:11:01.875 --> 1:11:04.583
Does he seem, uh… does he seem sad to you?

1:11:05.208 --> 1:11:06.083
No.

1:11:07.708 --> 1:11:09.916
He's an odd duck, like his dad.

1:11:11.458 --> 1:11:13.250
I happen to collect odd ducks.

1:11:15.166 --> 1:11:17.500
I don't know
if I should've built that game for him.

1:11:17.583 --> 1:11:20.166
Shouldn't he be outside,
playing with the rest of the kids?

1:11:20.250 --> 1:11:22.291
How is he gonna find his place
in the world?

1:11:22.375 --> 1:11:26.166
"His place in the world"?
He's a kid. We're his place in the world.

1:11:26.250 --> 1:11:28.000
You're his place in the world.

1:11:29.166 --> 1:11:33.875
[sighs] Okay, whatever is going on,
listen, I can tell you the truth

1:11:34.541 --> 1:11:36.708
or something
that's gonna make you feel better.

1:11:36.791 --> 1:11:39.291
I'd rather cut to it and tell you
the truth, if you're up for it.

1:11:39.375 --> 1:11:41.708
I… I'd rather something
that'll make me feel better.

1:11:41.791 --> 1:11:43.125
[laughs] Yeah, I know.

1:11:43.625 --> 1:11:45.250
Kidding. Sort of.

1:11:45.750 --> 1:11:47.291
Okay, tell me.

1:11:47.375 --> 1:11:49.708
When you are with us… [clicks tongue]

1:11:50.708 --> 1:11:52.041
…you're with us 100%.

1:11:52.791 --> 1:11:53.958
It's amazing.

1:11:54.708 --> 1:11:56.333
And when you're not…

1:11:56.416 --> 1:11:58.875
[laughs] …it's like… pfft.

1:11:59.750 --> 1:12:01.500
So is he a little lonely?

1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:03.666
Yeah, probably.

1:12:04.166 --> 1:12:06.208
But does that make you a shitty guy? No.

1:12:06.291 --> 1:12:07.791
I've gotta do better.

1:12:07.875 --> 1:12:10.958
Hey, buddy, I have good news for you.

1:12:11.041 --> 1:12:14.333
He doesn't need perfect.
He just needs you.

1:12:15.208 --> 1:12:18.000
Your cooking makes you
a borderline serial killer,

1:12:18.083 --> 1:12:20.333
but the rest of you is pretty awesome.

1:12:20.958 --> 1:12:21.958
Ellie.

1:12:23.708 --> 1:12:25.000
You know I love you.

1:12:25.083 --> 1:12:26.333
Yeah, I know.

1:12:26.416 --> 1:12:28.375
I'm extremely lovable.

1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:29.958
Yeah.

1:12:40.750 --> 1:12:41.666
[Ellie] Hmm.

1:12:42.458 --> 1:12:43.708
I have to go to work.

1:12:44.250 --> 1:12:45.125
Okay, okay, okay.

1:12:45.625 --> 1:12:47.791
-And, hey, you got time.
-[sighs]

1:12:51.750 --> 1:12:53.333
"It's later than you think."

1:12:56.833 --> 1:12:58.833
[ominous music playing]

1:13:05.041 --> 1:13:06.375
[young Adam] Really think we can?

1:13:07.208 --> 1:13:09.291
Maybe, maybe not. We'll see.

1:13:10.125 --> 1:13:11.916
But we're gonna try anyway.

1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:13.916
Destroy time travel. How will we do that?

We're gonna blow this bitch up.

is the only idea, it becomes a great idea.

1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:32.875
Who said that?

1:13:32.958 --> 1:13:35.666
You. Nine years from now,
right before you get arrested.

1:13:35.750 --> 1:13:36.875
-What?
-Try to focus.

1:13:36.958 --> 1:13:40.166
We'll have to deal with security.

They really, really wanna fight.

1:14:40.625 --> 1:14:42.750

1:14:42.833 --> 1:14:44.958

for this."

1:14:48.125 --> 1:14:50.291

-He's fine!

1:15:50.583 --> 1:15:52.000

-Hey?

1:15:52.083 --> 1:15:53.125
That's your mother's car.

1:15:54.458 --> 1:15:55.708

1:15:56.916 --> 1:15:58.166
What are you doin' here?

1:15:58.250 --> 1:16:00.750
I went to the motel,
and when I didn't find you there,

1:16:00.833 --> 1:16:02.666

1:16:02.750 --> 1:16:05.416

Oh God. Thank God. There's a plan.

you were making this up as you went along.

1:16:16.083 --> 1:16:18.041
Adam, I'm goin' inside.
Cover the perimeter.

1:16:18.125 --> 1:16:20.291
-No one gets in behind me.
-Sorry. That was harsh.

1:16:21.583 --> 1:16:23.916

You shaved my ass with a Subaru.

1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:26.750

1:16:33.458 --> 1:16:34.416

1:16:34.500 --> 1:16:37.375
I am not being critical.
I'm… I'm narrating.

1:16:37.458 --> 1:16:41.291
Will you just stop? Stop.
Where the hell are you going?

1:16:41.375 --> 1:16:43.708
To destroy your accelerator,
and I'm gonna enjoy it.

1:16:43.791 --> 1:16:45.916
Do you realize
that you have broken every rule?

1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:49.708
You've blown past every conceivable
ethical boundary like it wasn't there.

1:16:49.791 --> 1:16:52.125
Yeah? Then why are you here, Dad?

1:16:55.583 --> 1:16:57.666
Because you can't do it without me.

Here at Sorian Technologies,
we're building it.

1:17:08.541 --> 1:17:11.625
[Louis] If you destroy the accelerator,
Sorian will simply rebuild it.

1:17:11.708 --> 1:17:14.375
-[Adam] So what will work?
-[Louis] What you're after is ISPCA.

1:17:14.458 --> 1:17:16.708
Infinitely Shifting
Plasma Containing Algorithm,

1:17:16.791 --> 1:17:19.000
which I designed
to stabilize the wormholes.

1:17:19.083 --> 1:17:22.666
That is the mathematical equation
that will make time travel possible.

1:17:22.750 --> 1:17:24.250
How do you destroy math?

1:17:24.333 --> 1:17:28.708
I've never written the algorithm down
or demonstrated it to another human being,

1:17:28.791 --> 1:17:30.708
so it lives here in the old bean,

1:17:30.791 --> 1:17:34.583
and in the subbasement
in a diamond-hard neuromorphic processor.

1:17:34.666 --> 1:17:36.541
Are you talking about your penis?

1:17:36.625 --> 1:17:38.291
Can… can we be serious now?

1:17:38.375 --> 1:17:39.833
Yes. No. Yes.

1:17:39.916 --> 1:17:41.791
-It's a hard drive, okay?
-[chuckles]

1:17:41.875 --> 1:17:43.500
-God, you're such a child.
-Sorry.

1:17:43.583 --> 1:17:46.666
There is a crystal hard drive
running the algorithm in a closed loop.

1:17:46.750 --> 1:17:49.125
That is the nerve center
of the accelerator.

1:17:49.208 --> 1:17:53.458
So we go there, destroy the hard drive,
prevent time travel from being invented.

1:17:53.541 --> 1:17:54.708
Theoretically, time travel--

1:17:54.791 --> 1:17:57.333
Oh my God! You're killing me
with the theoretical.

1:17:57.416 --> 1:17:59.666
-Yes, that should do it.
-Good. Let's do that.

1:17:59.750 --> 1:18:01.250

This is where we house the hard drive.

1:19:07.875 --> 1:19:10.458
-[Adam] What happens if you pull it out?
-[Louis] One of two things.

1:19:10.541 --> 1:19:13.125
The accelerator will continue to run
on a dormant loop.

1:19:13.208 --> 1:19:16.833
But without the algorithm, no one
will ever be able to program it again.

1:19:18.125 --> 1:19:18.958
Or?

1:19:19.041 --> 1:19:21.666

we need to tell you.

I… I already know.

1:28:42.583 --> 1:28:44.541

I'm sorry that I'm… I'm not gonna
be there for you down the road,

1:28:53.333 --> 1:28:54.958
and I've given it a lot of thought,

1:28:55.041 --> 1:28:58.458
but you cannot tell me how
or when it happens.

1:28:59.125 --> 1:29:00.083

1:29:14.166 --> 1:29:15.791
that I got to see it?

I don't know if we're gonna
remember any of this,

1:31:11.791 --> 1:31:15.500
but maybe there'll be an echo
or somethin', like Laura said.

1:31:15.583 --> 1:31:16.833
But just in case,

1:31:19.500 --> 1:31:21.041
give Mom a hug for me.

1:31:21.625 --> 1:31:22.708
Would you do that?

1:31:23.541 --> 1:31:26.208
Not one of your lame-ass side hugs either.

1:34:02.000 --> 1:34:03.083
I love you, honey.

1:34:03.708 --> 1:34:04.708
Love you too.

1:34:07.416 --> 1:34:08.833
[man] So, as I said earlier,

1:34:08.916 --> 1:34:13.000
our goal is to calculate
the variability of gravitational force,

1:34:13.083 --> 1:34:16.250
which depends entirely
on whether your path of motion

1:34:16.333 --> 1:34:18.791
is toward the Earth or away from it.

1:34:19.458 --> 1:34:23.083
So let's define the gravitational force
of the Earth on an object

1:34:23.166 --> 1:34:25.875
by Newton's gravitational formula.

1:34:25.958 --> 1:34:30.625
F is equal to big G,
Newton's gravitational constant,

1:34:30.708 --> 1:34:33.708
multiplied by m sin 1 times m sin 2

1:34:33.791 --> 1:34:35.500
divided by r squared.

1:34:35.583 --> 1:34:38.833
And m sin 1 is the mass of the Earth,
m sin e,

1:34:39.583 --> 1:34:44.000
m sin 2 is the mass of the object
the Earth is exerting force on.

1:34:44.083 --> 1:34:46.208
-And r--
-Can you believe this guy?

1:34:56.791 --> 1:34:59.375
to fall fast asleep but keep my eyes open.

1:35:16.166 --> 1:35:18.208
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you too.

1:35:18.708 --> 1:35:21.958
-I'll, um… I'll be quiet.
-Okay.

1:35:22.041 --> 1:35:24.541
-Where do they find these guest lecturers?
-[snickering]

1:35:24.625 --> 1:35:25.583
Right?

1:35:26.625 --> 1:35:30.333
It's like they're genetically engineered
to bore us to death.

1:35:30.416 --> 1:35:32.375
You're totally a guest lecturer,
aren't you?

1:35:33.416 --> 1:35:35.625
-Yes, I am. Yeah.
-Shit.

1:35:35.708 --> 1:35:36.666
What's your field?

1:35:36.750 --> 1:35:39.000
Um… computational linguistics.

1:35:39.083 --> 1:35:40.083
-No way!
-Yeah.

1:35:40.166 --> 1:35:42.000
-I don't know what that is. Um…
-Oh.

1:35:43.041 --> 1:35:46.375
-What does that have to do with flying?
-Uh… not a damn thing.

1:35:46.875 --> 1:35:47.833
-Oh.
-Yeah.

1:35:48.583 --> 1:35:51.416
Oh. You're in the wrong place, I think.

1:35:51.500 --> 1:35:55.291
-That's subjective. This is Schaefer 309?
-Literally in the wrong place. Farrel 309.

1:35:55.375 --> 1:35:56.208
-No.
-Yep.

1:35:56.958 --> 1:35:58.083
-No.
-Yeah.

1:35:58.166 --> 1:36:00.333
[Laura] I don't think that…

1:36:00.416 --> 1:36:01.666
-[Adam] Yeah. Oof.
-Okay. Oh.

1:36:01.750 --> 1:36:03.250
-I knew it.
-Okay. All right.

1:36:03.333 --> 1:36:04.833
-Bingo. Yeah.
-Okay. Okay.

1:36:04.916 --> 1:36:06.750
Then I'm in the wrong building.

1:36:06.833 --> 1:36:08.791
Actually, you're in the wrong campus.

1:36:09.583 --> 1:36:10.875
[sighs]

1:36:10.958 --> 1:36:11.916
Then I'm lost.

1:36:13.250 --> 1:36:15.166
Not anymore. I found you.

1:36:24.041 --> 1:36:26.000
I can… I can walk you to Schaefer.

1:36:27.041 --> 1:36:30.666
Are you sure? I mean,
I would hate to disturb your sleep.

1:36:33.250 --> 1:36:34.125
I've, uh…

1:36:35.333 --> 1:36:36.375
I've got time.
