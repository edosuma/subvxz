00:12.283 --> 00:14.623
Another abandoned mine?!

00:14.922 --> 00:18.969
Come, Starscream.

00:28.633 --> 00:32.186
<i>My liege, who could have
foreseen that my alternative</i>

00:32.228 --> 00:34.825
<i>super-soldier experiment
would encounter... </i>

00:34.920 --> 00:37.002
technical difficulties?

00:37.225 --> 00:40.405
Resulting in the loss of the
Insecticon hive and over half

00:40.479 --> 00:44.102
- our remaining troops!
- Forgive me, master!

00:44.174 --> 00:47.456
My intentions were true! Please...

00:47.491 --> 00:52.664
please reconsider my termination!

00:58.420 --> 01:04.390
Oh, Shockwave's offsite laboratory.
Most impressive.

01:13.205 --> 01:16.856
<i>The Predacon clones have
almost fully evolved and will be</i>

01:16.934 --> 01:19.441
combat-ready within three solar cycles.

01:19.529 --> 01:25.489
Well done, Shockwave.
Knock out, I'm waiting.

01:25.603 --> 01:28.508
<i>On my way, lord Megatron.</i>

01:39.717 --> 01:43.099
Synthetic Energon ... troops
will be delivering my remaining

01:43.109 --> 01:46.739
- supply to you.
- I will determine its value

01:46.804 --> 01:51.247
after lord Megatron's Predacon
army is ready for deployment.

02:00.275 --> 02:02.428
Unruly beast!

02:02.483 --> 02:05.277
You dare to roam freely
without permission?

02:16.798 --> 02:19.549
- What?!
- Strike me again, and I will

02:19.663 --> 02:23.054
bury that rod in your spark.

02:27.511 --> 02:30.266

03:11.880 --> 03:17.020
I ... I did not realize that the
beast was capable of transformation.

03:17.020 --> 03:21.890
- Nor did I.
- I am no beast.

03:30.314 --> 03:33.359
The ability to transform is
a fundamental part of

03:33.359 --> 03:37.110
Cybertronian biology.
We simply posses no evidence

03:37.110 --> 03:40.880
that the Predacon species ever
reached that evolutionary stage,

03:40.880 --> 03:44.380
since they became extinct
in the great cataclysm.

03:44.380 --> 03:46.280
And now we know.

03:47.120 --> 03:51.650
So, the rumors are true.
I will no longer be alone.

03:51.660 --> 03:55.190
And I see you've been keeping
secrets.

03:55.190 --> 03:58.490
It was not my intention to
deceive you, lord Megatron.

03:58.500 --> 04:01.630
I only recently became
aware of my abilities.

04:01.630 --> 04:05.430
All I remember of my beginning
is hunting...

04:07.650 --> 04:09.260
<i>...and battle...</i>

04:10.780 --> 04:15.240
<i>And the wounding of my pride.
Thus I'd begun to burn with</i>

04:15.250 --> 04:18.920
<i>questions ... who am I?</i>

04:18.920 --> 04:22.180
<i>Where did I come from?
The warship's data banks</i>

04:22.190 --> 04:26.660
<i>provided historical fact, but,
still, I possessed no memory of</i>

04:26.660 --> 04:30.160
<i>my own past, so I began to
reconsider my place in the</i>

04:30.160 --> 04:34.730
<i>present and wondered,
"could I be like the others?"</i>

04:37.048 --> 04:41.070
- And now I know.
- Yet you are unique, a miracle

04:41.070 --> 04:45.440
of science, cloned by Shockwave
from cybernucleic acid,

04:45.440 --> 04:49.410
recovered from the remains
of your mighty ancestors.

04:55.775 --> 04:57.350
Doctor, what is the current

04:57.360 --> 05:00.220
status of your synthetic
Energon experiments?

05:00.220 --> 05:03.330
Doing the best I can,
Commander, given the lack of

05:03.330 --> 05:05.760
functional equipment at my disposal.

05:05.760 --> 05:09.030
You do realize that an
alternative energy source may be

05:09.030 --> 05:10.957
essential to our survival?

05:12.570 --> 05:16.770
Believe me, Ultra Magnus, no
one is more acutely aware of the

05:16.770 --> 05:18.923
stakes than I am.

05:21.580 --> 05:23.386
Of course.

05:25.500 --> 05:27.750
Beast Hunters, may I ask why you

05:27.750 --> 05:32.150
are not currently scouting
grid 305 for Predacon bones?

05:32.160 --> 05:36.060
Because we just returned
from surveying grids 301 to 304.

05:36.060 --> 05:38.630
To log our field reports, per

05:38.630 --> 05:41.700
your protocol, Commander Magnus, sir.

05:44.782 --> 05:46.000
Soldier, I don't recall

05:46.000 --> 05:49.210
giving you permission to leave the base.

05:49.210 --> 05:52.880
- Because you didn't, sir.
- Why are your hands smeared

05:52.880 --> 05:56.610
- with coolant?
- I... recalibrated your ship's

05:56.610 --> 06:02.920
engines. You can expect a
10% increase in vector thrust.

06:07.513 --> 06:10.020
- Welcome back!
- Optimus, good to see you!

06:10.050 --> 06:14.330
- It's good to have you back, Optimus.
- Decepticon activity is at a lull.

06:14.330 --> 06:16.410
I fear that Megatron may have

06:16.510 --> 06:21.080
collected the specimens
he requires to...

06:22.530 --> 06:24.530
clone his army.

06:25.540 --> 06:30.310
<i>It is with deepest gratitude
for my creation that I pledge</i>

06:30.310 --> 06:34.840
<i>undying obedience to
you, my one true master.</i>

06:34.850 --> 06:39.060
But with more of my species
soon to stride among us, I

06:39.060 --> 06:45.240
beg your permission to, in
turn, lead them as Predaking.

06:45.760 --> 06:49.230
Your vision is boundless.

06:53.087 --> 06:58.330
<i>A former beast may fully believe
himself to be a loyal servant today,</i>

06:58.340 --> 07:03.444
but trust me, the moment
our royal highness realizes that

07:03.444 --> 07:07.460
his army possesses greater might
than what currently remains of...

07:07.460 --> 07:12.580
- the Decepticons...
- Evolution will give way to revolution.

07:12.620 --> 07:18.620
I am left with no choice but
to eradicate the Predacon clones

07:18.810 --> 07:25.630
before they are provided the
opportunity to eradicate us.

07:31.722 --> 07:34.410
Lord Megatron, you're not
saying you intend to pull

07:34.410 --> 07:38.410
the plug on Shockwave's
beloved project Predacon.

07:38.620 --> 07:41.980
Your conclusion is most logical, my liege.

07:42.980 --> 07:44.000
But what happens

07:44.000 --> 07:47.060
if that fire-breathing brute
discovers our treachery?

07:47.060 --> 07:51.500
Why assume that we will be
the ones to perform the deed?

07:51.500 --> 07:55.940
After all, if the Predaking
were to discover that, say,

07:55.940 --> 08:00.670
the Autobots were responsible
for wiping out his comrades,

08:00.680 --> 08:04.620
our resident beast
might, in turn, destroy

08:04.690 --> 08:09.670
our hated enemies for us...
or they him.

08:17.130 --> 08:23.130
Ultra Magnus...
something has been troubling you.

08:23.941 --> 08:26.030
I fear that my command style

08:26.040 --> 08:29.300
may be having a negative
effect on unit morale.

08:29.310 --> 08:34.650
Your service is most welcome,
old friend, but this is not the elite guard.

08:35.100 --> 08:38.600
Things have changed since the
war for Cybertron.

08:38.600 --> 08:41.667
And we must adapt to that change.

08:42.126 --> 08:45.713
The members of Team Prime are
not cogs in a machine ...

08:45.838 --> 08:49.341
they've grown into something
greater than an army.

08:49.341 --> 08:50.843
They have become ...

08:50.926 --> 08:52.990
<i>Optimus, our scanners have</i>

08:53.000 --> 08:55.860
detected exposed Energon.

08:57.340 --> 09:00.790
With our reserves at a critical low,

09:00.790 --> 09:04.250
we cannot afford not to investigate.

09:10.571 --> 09:15.280
<i>Decepticons, step away from
the Energon and surrender.</i>

09:56.790 --> 09:59.960
Look at all that sweet fuel.

10:02.210 --> 10:06.200
Stealth team, transport
our cargo back to base.

10:06.200 --> 10:09.770
- Wreckers, reconnoiter the mine.
- I've always wanted to roll

10:09.770 --> 10:14.120
with the Wreckers...
uh, sir.

10:20.510 --> 10:25.020
- No Energon signals.
- And no additional security.

10:25.020 --> 10:27.320
Something doesn't smell right.

10:38.800 --> 10:40.330
Pair off.

11:00.340 --> 11:04.360
Well, this is one whole lot of ugly.

11:04.360 --> 11:09.460
Megatron's cloning operation seems
further along than we anticipated.

11:17.470 --> 11:21.540
<i>Starscream, the
Autobots have arrived.</i>

11:21.540 --> 11:24.750
<i>You did not inform me that
your plan was already in motion.</i>

11:24.750 --> 11:28.820
Only so the whole affair
would appear less... staged.

11:28.820 --> 11:31.790
<i>I have yet to purge my
lab of sensitive materials.</i>

11:31.790 --> 11:34.790
Then do not let me
keep you, Shockwave.

11:34.790 --> 11:37.460
Over and out.

11:37.930 --> 11:41.660
You scrapped him on
purpose, didn't you?

11:44.450 --> 11:48.550
Soundwave, I require
an immediate ground bridge.

12:26.210 --> 12:28.680
<i>Lord Megatron, it seems</i>

12:28.680 --> 12:32.280
project Predacon has
fallen into Autobot hands!

12:32.280 --> 12:35.320
- How is this possible?!
- Starscream, scramble your

12:35.320 --> 12:39.120
- seeker armada!
- At once, my liege.

12:39.120 --> 12:44.970
No! If my brethren are imperiled,
I will confront the enemy.

13:17.190 --> 13:20.590
Permission to employ a
grenade in a confined space, sir?

13:20.600 --> 13:22.760
If you and I are all that

13:22.770 --> 13:26.000
stand between these monsters
and the natives of this planet,

13:26.000 --> 13:30.450
then, by all means, blow these
beasts back to the rust age.

14:10.920 --> 14:12.550
Who's this guy?

14:12.550 --> 14:16.050
The very same who has
previously allowed you to live,

14:16.050 --> 14:17.520
but will not today.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.730
He's the Predacon!

14:35.400 --> 14:36.540
Whoa! What was that?!

14:45.260 --> 14:48.560
What have you done to my brethren?!

14:49.890 --> 14:53.110
What have you done?!

15:14.690 --> 15:18.580
Well, then, let's dance.

18:22.020 --> 18:25.130
And here, I was
just beginning to tolerate you.

18:25.130 --> 18:28.910
It's been an honor serving
beside you, soldier.

18:35.690 --> 18:38.350
Prepare to perish.

19:02.720 --> 19:05.810
What?! No!

19:49.250 --> 19:53.650
Ratchet will take good care of you.

19:54.900 --> 19:58.360
Magnus fought like a Wrecker.

19:58.370 --> 20:01.310
Optimus, when we spoke earlier...

20:01.310 --> 20:08.210
- what could be greater than an army?
- A human concept, one I have

20:08.210 --> 20:10.410
learned since coming to Earth...

20:13.950 --> 20:15.610
family.

20:22.190 --> 20:24.890
<i>Do not despair, my Predaking...</i>

20:26.760 --> 20:30.330
... for I vow to you that the

20:30.330 --> 20:36.300
Autobots will pay dearly for
the outrage against your kind.

20:36.300 --> 20:38.670
Shockwave, report.

20:38.670 --> 20:41.610
<i>It is true, my liege.
Project Predacon has been</i>

20:41.610 --> 20:44.740
<i>rendered null and void ...
at least, I have been unable to</i>

20:44.750 --> 20:48.110
<i>recover any beast-forms.
However, there is something </i>

20:48.120 --> 20:50.380
<i>you must behold for yourself.</i>

20:54.310 --> 20:56.520
What is this?!

21:00.640 --> 21:04.960
<i>Pure Cybertronian
cybermatter, not unlike that</i>

21:04.970 --> 21:09.400
which once existed upon
our primeval home world.

21:09.400 --> 21:13.940
Or that which engendered
my citadel here on Earth.

21:13.940 --> 21:18.380
- The result of the explosion?
- Indeed, yet the cybernucleic

21:18.380 --> 21:22.210
acid alone cannot account
for these... cyber-forms.

21:22.220 --> 21:25.850
All possible logic points to
the presence of one unexpected

21:25.850 --> 21:31.120
variable ...
synthetic Energon.
