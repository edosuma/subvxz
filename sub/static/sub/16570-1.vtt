00:21.471 --> 00:23.371
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

00:23.540 --> 00:24.939
<i>They're dead. Four of them.</i>

00:25.108 --> 00:27.633
<i>- I saw them. You gotta send somebody.
- Slow down.</i>

00:27.811 --> 00:29.745
<i>- Tell me your name.
- Anna. Anna Quezada.</i>

00:29.913 --> 00:31.540
<i>Are you at the location now, ma'am?</i>

00:31.715 --> 00:33.876
<i>No, I live... I'm across the street.</i>

00:34.050 --> 00:35.347
<i>My daughter, she found them.</i>

00:35.518 --> 00:38.078
<i>- Why? Why would somebody?
- Ma'am, ma'am, calm down.</i>

00:38.254 --> 00:41.883
<i>- What's the address?
- 214 26th street.</i>

00:42.058 --> 00:43.685
<i>Oh, there was so much blood.</i>

00:43.860 --> 00:46.761
<i>Stay on the line.
I'm gonna dispatch units to that location...</i>

00:46.930 --> 00:49.899
<i>...and come right back to you, okay?
- Please hurry.</i>

01:20.296 --> 01:22.059
Yeah. Yeah.

01:40.817 --> 01:45.151
Hey, chief. We got four dead,
shot execution style.

01:45.321 --> 01:49.382
Two adult females and, uh, two kids.

01:49.559 --> 01:51.823
Looks like they've been there
a few hours.

01:51.995 --> 01:53.053
No casings.

01:53.863 --> 01:55.831
Little girl there,
lives across the street.

01:55.999 --> 01:57.967
She was coming after school
for a playdate.

01:58.134 --> 02:00.329
Door was unlocked.
She walked in and found them.

02:00.503 --> 02:03.961
Mom called 911.
I got Sanchez already knocking on doors.

02:04.140 --> 02:08.975
Lieutenant Tao got a copy of the warrant
five minutes ago. He's inside with Buzz.

02:24.894 --> 02:28.330
And even with all that noise you think
somebody would've heard something.

02:31.835 --> 02:35.828
To muffle the sound,
he shot through a pillow. It's in here.

02:37.207 --> 02:41.075
Buzz, be sure and document this
pillow by the chocolate bars.

02:50.653 --> 02:51.984
They were eating breakfast.

02:52.155 --> 02:55.022
I checked all the rooms.

02:55.191 --> 02:57.523
Back door was dead-bolted.
The windows were locked.

02:57.694 --> 03:00.595
Whoever did this
came and left through the front door.

03:10.740 --> 03:12.207
I need time of death.

03:12.375 --> 03:14.275
- Where's the coroner?
- Here. Here. Sorry.

03:14.444 --> 03:16.708
Went to the wrong place. Uh...

03:19.716 --> 03:21.775
All right if I get a liver temp.
On just one of them?

03:21.951 --> 03:23.942
- Yes, that's fine.
- Thank you.

03:38.768 --> 03:41.134
Mother was trying to protect her.

03:45.308 --> 03:47.776
This kid can't be more than 10 years old.

03:47.944 --> 03:50.640
Probably told them to lie down,
he wouldn't hurt them.

03:52.248 --> 03:56.082
Covered them with the blankets
so he didn't have to see their faces.

03:57.887 --> 04:02.586
Started with her, then her, her.

04:04.627 --> 04:06.561
Boy heard the shots.

04:07.463 --> 04:09.260
Tried to run away.

04:13.703 --> 04:15.193
Hey, chief.

04:16.172 --> 04:17.833
Oh.

04:19.676 --> 04:22.839
So far, the, uh, only person that anyone saw
leaving this house today...

04:23.012 --> 04:24.673
...was the husband-slash-father.

04:24.847 --> 04:25.871
What a surprise.

04:26.049 --> 04:29.109
And that was at 8:15 a.m. This morning,
same as every other day.

04:29.285 --> 04:32.618
- Okay, what's his name, the father?
- Father's name is Victor Rivera.

04:32.789 --> 04:34.188
He drives a blue Chevy Malibu.

04:34.357 --> 04:36.917
The neighbor across the street
was taking out her trash.

04:37.093 --> 04:41.427
- She said Rivera waved at her and smiled.
- Son of a bitch shoots his whole family...

04:41.597 --> 04:43.622
...comes out smiling.
- Lieutenant.

04:43.967 --> 04:46.094
- Buzz, stop the camera.
- I can't stop the tape.

04:46.269 --> 04:47.634
Reload and start over.

04:48.805 --> 04:52.741
Lieutenant, if we decide on a suspect
before we begin our investigation...

04:52.909 --> 04:56.072
...the defense will have a field day
when we go to trial.

04:58.381 --> 05:00.281
Thank you. We'll talk to this father...

05:00.450 --> 05:04.079
...but let's find out what we can here first
and stay calm doing it, okay?

05:04.253 --> 05:05.277
These cameras.

05:05.621 --> 05:09.421
All right, the woman who called 911,
her name is Anna Quezada.

05:09.592 --> 05:11.150
She's a friend of the family.

05:11.327 --> 05:16.390
She said that Victor and his wife Cynthia
were working through some problems.

05:17.000 --> 05:22.063
The son is Miguel
and the daughter is, uh, Lucia.

05:22.538 --> 05:25.837
And this is Cynthia's mother Diana.

05:26.009 --> 05:28.773
She was staying with them
through the summer.

05:28.945 --> 05:31.175
All right, look out, Julio.

05:31.347 --> 05:34.145
I'm late. I went to the wrong address.
You know why?

05:34.317 --> 05:35.716
They gave me the wrong street.

05:35.885 --> 05:38.718
They gave me 26th Place
instead of 26th Street.

05:38.888 --> 05:40.219
All right, all right.

05:40.390 --> 05:44.292
Room temp.'s 79, liver temp. 93. Uh...

05:44.460 --> 05:47.987
A wild guess at time of death, I'd say
between 7:30 and 9:00 this morning.

05:48.164 --> 05:51.327
And the father was seen
leaving at 8:15 a.m., chief.

05:51.501 --> 05:56.336
Okay, found a paystub with Rivera's name
on it from Duppy's Paint and Body.

05:56.506 --> 05:57.871
Address, Silver Lake.

05:58.207 --> 06:02.337
All right, if you and Lieutenant Provenza
would see if he's there, bring him in.

06:02.512 --> 06:03.774
Calmly.

06:03.946 --> 06:06.414
Don't tell him anything
and try not to spook him.

06:06.582 --> 06:09.016
- He could be armed.
- Yeah.

06:14.223 --> 06:16.487
Detective Sanchez.

06:16.759 --> 06:19.193
- Go through the family pictures, please.
- Yes, ma'am.

06:19.362 --> 06:21.091
Thank you.

06:36.412 --> 06:40.906
Meet Victor Rivera.
He has a criminal record.

06:41.084 --> 06:43.609
He was arrested for domestic violence
six months ago...

06:43.786 --> 06:45.413
...but the charges were dropped.

06:46.656 --> 06:49.056
That was Flynn.
He's bringing Rivera up now.

06:49.225 --> 06:50.715
And he didn't have a gun.

06:51.127 --> 06:52.719
Well, let's start looking for it.

06:52.895 --> 06:54.795
Detective Sanchez,
chart his path to work.

06:54.964 --> 06:57.432
And let's put the word out,
I want this case ironclad.

06:57.600 --> 06:59.227
Yes, ma'am.

07:02.371 --> 07:04.896
Commander. And Mr. Ramos.

07:05.074 --> 07:06.939
To what do we owe this happy surprise?

07:07.577 --> 07:09.602
Uh, can we talk, chief?

07:14.417 --> 07:17.875
Look, these murders
are going to be front-page news...

07:18.054 --> 07:19.715
...no matter what we do.

07:19.889 --> 07:24.417
Pope made an agreement with Ramos here
that he will only print what we confirm.

07:24.594 --> 07:27.188
- Oh.
- So, look, you do what you need to do.

07:27.363 --> 07:30.127
I'll babysit him. All right?

07:30.299 --> 07:32.631
So this is your guy, the father?

07:33.102 --> 07:34.660
He's a person of interest.

07:34.837 --> 07:37.772
But in cases like this,
isn't it almost always a family member?

07:37.940 --> 07:40.465
Or drugs or gangs.

07:40.643 --> 07:44.238
Why don't you just have
a seat right here, okay? Good.

07:44.413 --> 07:46.074
- Do you mind?
- Pardon me?

07:51.554 --> 07:53.283
Everything go all right, lieutenant?

07:54.824 --> 07:56.223
I've been telling assholes...

07:56.392 --> 07:59.589
...to shut up and come with me
since before you could tie your shoes.

07:59.762 --> 08:02.060
- I wasn't trying to start any...
- Watch your mouth.

08:02.231 --> 08:03.926
Okay, all right. Enough.

08:09.505 --> 08:12.065
- Lieutenant Flynn.
- Yeah, well, Rivera's in one...

08:12.241 --> 08:13.765
...and he's a real piece of work.

08:13.943 --> 08:17.902
You know what he's been bellyaching about
the whole way here? How mistreated he is.

08:18.581 --> 08:20.776
Chief Johnson,
is it true that the young girl...

08:20.950 --> 08:24.010
...was still clutching her doll
when you found her?

08:29.025 --> 08:32.289
Here's what I can confirm
as being in the vicinity of the young girl...

08:32.461 --> 08:35.191
...blood and brain matter.

08:38.833 --> 08:39.857
Sergeant Gabriel.

08:46.409 --> 08:50.209
Good afternoon, Mr. Rivera.
I'm Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson.

08:50.379 --> 08:53.815
- Someone's read you your rights, correct?
- Yeah. Now, what's this about?

08:59.055 --> 09:00.955
<i>- Like what?
- Tell me about your morning...</i>

09:01.123 --> 09:03.114
<i>...say from 7:00 on.</i>

09:03.292 --> 09:05.453
<i>- I was sleeping, woke up at 7:30.
- Hey. Sit here.</i>

09:05.628 --> 09:07.789
<i>- I done nothing wrong.
- After you woke up?</i>

09:07.964 --> 09:10.125
Showered, got dressed,
helped with the kids.

09:10.299 --> 09:11.857
- Breakfast?
- I didn't have time.

09:12.034 --> 09:14.161
I don't have time for this.
I'm losing money.

09:14.337 --> 09:18.068
The more uncooperative you are, the longer
this'll take, the more it will cost.

09:18.241 --> 09:22.143
- Why didn't you have time for breakfast?
- If you had kids, you wouldn't need to ask.

09:22.311 --> 09:26.247
She's looking for what might've set him off,
to see how easily he loses his temper.

09:26.415 --> 09:29.680
Takes every minute I have
to get them ready for school in the morning.

09:29.852 --> 09:32.753
- What time did you leave for work?
- I don't know, 8:15, 8:30?

09:32.922 --> 09:35.914
- Can anyone confirm that?
- Yeah, my wife, my kids.

09:40.062 --> 09:43.327
You had a run-in with the law
about six months ago...

09:43.499 --> 09:46.229
...a domestic-violence issue.
- Man, I've changed.

09:47.103 --> 09:49.765
I'm going back to church.
I'm spending more time with family...

09:49.939 --> 09:52.407
God gives you the strength
not to beat your wife?

09:55.478 --> 09:57.503
That... That was a one-time thing.

09:58.080 --> 10:00.275
We're having some ups and downs,
but nothing...

10:00.449 --> 10:02.747
How's your relationship now
with your wife?

10:03.452 --> 10:05.682
Did Cynthia...?
Why would you have known...? Wait.

10:06.355 --> 10:08.220
Did Cynthia call you and complain?

10:08.391 --> 10:10.518
- Why? What did you do?
- Nothing.

10:12.328 --> 10:13.522
What?

10:14.563 --> 10:15.587
What?

10:16.499 --> 10:18.763
Mr. Rivera, I wanna thank you
for all your help.

10:19.802 --> 10:21.269
Sorry to put you through that...

10:21.437 --> 10:24.634
...but it was important
that we eliminate you as a suspect.

10:24.807 --> 10:26.968
<i>- A suspect?
- She's buying his story?</i>

10:27.143 --> 10:28.633
Not necessarily.

10:28.811 --> 10:31.302
Now she's gotta tell him
that his children are dead.

10:31.914 --> 10:35.782
I'm sorry to tell you that something terrible
happened at your house today.

10:35.951 --> 10:37.418
- At my house?
- Yes, sir...

10:37.586 --> 10:40.987
...I'm sorry to report that your wife,
mother-in-law, son and daughter...

10:41.157 --> 10:42.818
- What?
- They were found dead...

10:42.992 --> 10:44.323
- No.
...at your house this morning.

10:44.493 --> 10:45.926
- No, you're wrong.
- I'm sorry.

10:46.095 --> 10:48.290
No. I need to go.
I need to go home right now!

10:48.464 --> 10:49.897
- Sir.
- Let me go! I need to see them!

10:50.066 --> 10:51.465
- Mr. Rivera!
- No, sir.

10:51.634 --> 10:52.726
Oh, God.

10:52.902 --> 10:55.837
I know what you're going through
is incredibly dif... Sergeant!

11:02.945 --> 11:05.607
You're not gonna release this tape
to anyone, are you?

11:05.781 --> 11:07.510
- Absolutely not.
- No way.

11:08.818 --> 11:10.479
Fantastic.

11:29.739 --> 11:32.799
- Make sure he sits here.
- Testing. One, two. Testing.

11:32.975 --> 11:35.136
- Flynn.
- I'm not hearing him.

11:35.311 --> 11:37.370
- Buzz. Testing.
- She's coming up. Let's go.

11:37.546 --> 11:39.138
- I don't have sound.
- Get it fast.

11:39.315 --> 11:41.613
I can't be responsible
for this old equipment.

11:41.784 --> 11:43.445
One, two, testing. Buzz.

11:43.619 --> 11:45.644
I'm working on it. Just a second.

11:50.726 --> 11:52.921
Here you go, Mr. Rivera.

11:54.964 --> 11:57.091
Nice, comfortable room.

11:57.266 --> 11:59.826
I'm just so tired, man.

12:03.773 --> 12:04.797
It's not my fault.

12:04.974 --> 12:07.204
Well, this can't go on.
He could be confessing right now.

12:08.577 --> 12:10.010
- What's wrong?
- We don't have sound.

12:10.679 --> 12:12.010
Yeah. Still no sound.

12:16.886 --> 12:18.012
Uh...

12:25.795 --> 12:27.660
<i>- Somebody in your life...</i>

12:27.830 --> 12:28.854
Oh, Buzz.

12:29.031 --> 12:31.693
<i>- Carrying a grudge
or was angry about anything?</i>

12:32.034 --> 12:33.661
I guess, um...

12:35.271 --> 12:38.468
I guess there was this guy,
my neighbor, Emil something.

12:38.641 --> 12:39.972
He thinks I ran over his dog.

12:41.544 --> 12:45.503
- This was, like, three months ago.
- We'll check that out. What else?

12:47.216 --> 12:51.380
- There was this boy in one of her classes.
- Your wife was a teacher?

12:51.554 --> 12:53.283
Yeah. Name's Nelson.

12:53.756 --> 12:57.157
He threatened her in class last week.
I don't remember what for. Look...

12:58.828 --> 13:00.489
- I wanna go home, please.
- Sir...

13:00.663 --> 13:03.632
- Please, let me go home.
- Sir, your home is a crime scene.

13:03.799 --> 13:07.326
- You can't go there right now.
- I can't... Look, I can't think anymore.

13:07.503 --> 13:11.906
Look, Mr. Rivera, I know that you're tired,
but I'm not the only one asking questions.

13:12.274 --> 13:14.469
You think you have secrets? You don't.

13:15.411 --> 13:18.175
The media will examine
every nook and cranny of your life...

13:18.347 --> 13:20.975
...and I need to know exactly
what they're going to find.

13:21.150 --> 13:24.210
Otherwise, I'll have no way to answer them
when they come to me...

13:24.386 --> 13:28.550
...and say that you murdered your family.
And that is what they're going to say.

13:30.493 --> 13:32.324
I need, uh...

13:34.463 --> 13:36.522
I need to talk to someone.

13:41.537 --> 13:43.402
Okay. Who do you need to talk to?

13:45.007 --> 13:46.941
- My priest. Please?
- Oh.

13:49.178 --> 13:50.736
- My priest.
- Sir, listen...

13:50.913 --> 13:53.575
...it's just not a good idea.
- I wanna talk to my priest.

13:53.749 --> 13:55.444
Well, then, pray with me.

13:57.319 --> 13:59.116
Will you pray with me, please?

14:01.590 --> 14:03.057
Pray with me.

14:03.225 --> 14:05.557
I, uh... I need to pray.

14:05.728 --> 14:08.697
Okay, okay. I'll pray with you.

14:12.768 --> 14:15.532
Please forgive me
for how I sinned against my family.

14:17.106 --> 14:20.234
Please forgive me
for what I did to them.

14:20.910 --> 14:22.775
Forgive you for what?

14:28.551 --> 14:29.745
Help me, please.

14:29.919 --> 14:32.046
God will help you. He will.

14:32.221 --> 14:35.156
Just tell me what you did. Go ahead.

14:46.001 --> 14:47.491
I had an affair.

14:50.539 --> 14:53.201
<i>Okay. You had an affair with whom?</i>

14:53.375 --> 14:54.899
Oh, man.

14:55.277 --> 14:57.575
We're gonna be here all night.

14:58.113 --> 14:59.774
- Okay.
- I'm so sorry.

14:59.949 --> 15:02.440
Okay, and what is her name, this woman?

15:06.989 --> 15:09.514
Aria. Aria Mazón.

15:10.759 --> 15:13.853
When Cynthia found out,
she was gonna leave me.

15:14.830 --> 15:17.993
But I swore that I'd stop
and be a better man.

15:18.968 --> 15:22.028
Okay. This relationship, it ended badly?

15:22.204 --> 15:23.865
I'm so sorry.

15:25.708 --> 15:29.166
My babies. Miguel.

15:30.346 --> 15:33.713
- I'm so sorry.
- I need you to give me her address, okay?

15:34.183 --> 15:36.378
My beautiful Lucia.

15:36.552 --> 15:39.715
- What is this woman's address? Tell me.
- Just wanna go home.

15:39.888 --> 15:42.049
I just wanna be alone.

15:42.224 --> 15:44.954
I don't understand why I can't just leave.

15:54.703 --> 15:57.536
Okay, lieutenant, if you could
please find this Aria woman...

15:57.706 --> 16:00.072
...find out how angry she was
about this breakup.

16:00.242 --> 16:02.005
- Thank you.
- You got it, chief.

16:02.177 --> 16:03.269
Lieutenant Provenza.

16:03.445 --> 16:06.107
If you don't mind,
I'd like to ask you and Buzz...

16:06.281 --> 16:10.047
...to spend the night here with me
while I continue to question Mr. Rivera.

16:10.219 --> 16:13.655
- If he pulls himself together.
- Whatever you need, chief.

16:13.822 --> 16:18.418
God knows I've got nothing else
going on in my life.

16:28.437 --> 16:31.304
- I'm sorry, the kitchen just closed.
- I'm not hungry.

16:31.473 --> 16:33.907
Lieutenant Andy Flynn, L.A.P.D.

16:34.076 --> 16:37.273
- Are you Aria Mazón?
- Yes.

16:37.446 --> 16:40.438
I'd like to ask you some questions
about Victor Rivera.

16:42.317 --> 16:46.048
You and Mr. Rivera were having
an intimate relationship, is that right?

16:47.690 --> 16:49.920
We saw each other some,
for about a year, yeah.

16:50.459 --> 16:53.792
- When did it stop?
- Six months ago.

16:54.430 --> 16:58.457
I should've known it would end like that.
God doesn't reward the sinner, right?

16:58.901 --> 17:00.630
No.

17:00.803 --> 17:02.293
No, he doesn't.

17:03.539 --> 17:06.098
Something happened. Didn't it?

17:06.775 --> 17:09.242
- With Vic? That's why you're here?
- Oh, he's fine.

17:09.411 --> 17:11.742
But his family
was found murdered this morning.

17:13.982 --> 17:15.040
Oh, God.

17:18.454 --> 17:19.647
His kids too?

17:24.093 --> 17:27.756
- Wait. You don't think he did it?
- Why shouldn't I?

17:27.930 --> 17:29.625
Victor is a good man.

17:30.032 --> 17:33.092
- He's always trying to live right.
- Is that why he had the affair?

17:34.803 --> 17:37.067
It was tearing him up,
what we were doing.

17:37.239 --> 17:39.537
That's why he broke it off.

17:40.309 --> 17:42.504
I just can't believe it.

17:45.280 --> 17:47.009
Well...

17:47.182 --> 17:50.515
...I hate to ask, Miss Mazón,
but it's part of my job.

17:50.686 --> 17:52.813
Can you tell me where you were
this morning...

17:52.988 --> 17:54.649
...between the hours of 8 and 10?

17:55.891 --> 17:59.691
I take an exercise class,
8:00 every morning.

18:00.028 --> 18:03.520
Actually got into it because Victor
used to get on me about being healthy.

18:03.932 --> 18:06.196
He was pretty strict
about that kind of thing.

18:06.902 --> 18:08.699
At home with his kids too.

18:08.871 --> 18:10.839
No sugar, no soda, no TV.

18:11.473 --> 18:12.963
Nothing like that.

18:15.611 --> 18:18.774
He loved those kids so much.

18:35.764 --> 18:36.958
Thank you.

18:50.245 --> 18:53.305
- Finally letting him go to sleep?
- It's either him or me.

18:53.782 --> 18:56.046
How are we doing on our follow-ups?

18:56.218 --> 18:59.051
Well, uh, Gabriel talked to the guy
with the dead dog.

18:59.221 --> 19:02.315
Alibi's good. Same goes for the kid
in Mrs. Rivera's class.

19:02.491 --> 19:07.224
- And what about the girlfriend, Aria?
- Flynn is still trying to clear her.

19:07.396 --> 19:08.420
Now, get this, chief.

19:08.597 --> 19:13.933
According to Aria, Rivera was a stickler
about sweets in the home.

19:14.102 --> 19:15.569
I mean, no sugar, no soda.

19:16.104 --> 19:17.503
Which is strange because...

19:17.673 --> 19:21.404
Because there was a huge box
of candy bars on the floor next to the boy.

19:23.278 --> 19:28.944
So what? You think the father just came in,
saw the candy and flipped out?

19:29.551 --> 19:31.917
People kill for less.

19:33.121 --> 19:34.588
Oh, I hate to ask you this...

19:34.756 --> 19:36.951
...but can you drive me
back to the crime scene?

19:37.693 --> 19:39.217
Just give me a second.

19:39.394 --> 19:43.592
- Let me get my jacket and take a whiz.
- Thanks.

19:50.472 --> 19:54.841
You know, chief, Flynn says
Rivera dumped this girlfriend pretty hard.

19:55.010 --> 19:57.877
- Gives her a strong motive.
- Uh-huh.

19:58.046 --> 20:00.640
Put yourself out there for someone,
fix yourself up.

20:00.816 --> 20:05.276
You think they want the same things,
then suddenly, out of nowhere: Wham.

20:07.256 --> 20:08.587
They tell you it's over.

20:10.292 --> 20:11.759
And your heart...

20:14.029 --> 20:15.553
...it's squashed like a bug.

20:22.237 --> 20:24.831
- Provenza, where are we?
- What?

20:26.408 --> 20:30.139
Oh, bullshit Marie.
This is the same thing I did yesterday.

20:30.312 --> 20:34.305
I'm sorry, chief. You see?
You see where it says "26th Place"?

20:34.483 --> 20:38.044
Crime scene's two blocks away,
at 214 26th Street.

20:38.220 --> 20:40.654
Wait. Stop the car. Stop the car.

20:40.822 --> 20:45.122
- Chief, this is the wrong address.
- Maybe it's not.

20:45.294 --> 20:47.854
You came here first
and so did the coroner.

20:48.196 --> 20:50.494
Chief, what are you doing?

20:54.136 --> 20:55.626
Chief.

20:57.039 --> 21:02.602
Wait a minute. Would you wait once?
Wait for me, please.

21:09.518 --> 21:11.850
L.A.P.D. I've got some questions
I wanna ask.

21:12.688 --> 21:15.452
Nope. Excuse me.

21:15.624 --> 21:18.684
- Agent. FBI. Agent... Agent?
- Let's go. Let's go.

21:18.860 --> 21:21.328
- I've got some questions.
- This is FBI operation.

21:21.496 --> 21:23.657
Police have no business here.
Keep walking.

21:23.832 --> 21:26.130
- This is a murder investigation.
- Let's go.

21:26.301 --> 21:29.737
You have no right to...
Who is this young...? Who is he?

21:31.573 --> 21:33.734
Oh, well, I never.

21:34.142 --> 21:37.202
- Have you ever?
- No.

21:45.153 --> 21:47.678
He's just a boy in his teens.

21:48.023 --> 21:50.548
And you didn't get a chance
to question him at all?

21:50.726 --> 21:56.289
No, because your rude FBI goons
swooped in out of nowhere, took him away.

21:56.465 --> 21:58.558
Sounds like a protected witness.

21:58.734 --> 22:00.224
Duh.

22:00.602 --> 22:04.299
We checked the title on the house.
Belongs to a 77-year-old woman.

22:04.473 --> 22:06.168
Her name is Rosa Faron.

22:06.541 --> 22:09.339
She's got an 18-year-old grandson
by the name of Hector Cruz.

22:09.511 --> 22:12.309
- You ever heard of him?
- Not that I can remember.

22:12.481 --> 22:14.847
Do you want me to call around?

22:15.384 --> 22:16.715
No. No, no.

22:16.885 --> 22:18.716
Because then you'll be in the middle...

22:18.887 --> 22:21.355
...and I'm trying very hard
not to let that happen.

22:21.523 --> 22:22.990
I ran Hector's name.

22:23.392 --> 22:26.850
- Quite a record for someone so young.
- Thinking he was the intended target?

22:27.029 --> 22:30.226
And the killer mixed up the addresses,
just like we did.

22:30.399 --> 22:32.867
- Why would someone want Hector dead?
- Call L.A. Clear.

22:33.035 --> 22:35.765
- They can give background.
- Don't like the Clearing House.

22:35.937 --> 22:38.428
What could you possibly have
against the database...

22:38.607 --> 22:41.098
...which tracks warrants, wiretaps
and witnesses...

22:41.276 --> 22:43.676
...for every law-enforcement agency
in the state...

22:43.845 --> 22:46.871
...all to prevent someone,
yourself, for example...

22:47.049 --> 22:50.541
...from tripping into an open investigation,
which is probably what you did?

22:50.719 --> 22:54.621
If I call Clearing House and they tell me
I'm crossing wires with another case...

22:54.790 --> 22:57.258
...they could stop me
from moving forward with my own.

22:57.426 --> 23:00.486
Instead of working against the system,
why don't you try using it?

23:00.662 --> 23:03.597
You can get something done
without always making people angry.

23:03.765 --> 23:06.359
I don't always make people angry
with me.

23:08.170 --> 23:09.865
I have to go. I need the cat.

23:10.672 --> 23:13.300
- Where you taking her?
- Back to the vet.

23:13.475 --> 23:16.239
- Why?
- She has not eaten since yesterday morning.

23:16.411 --> 23:17.844
Oh, no, no, no.

23:18.013 --> 23:21.005
- I'll get her to eat.
- No, honey, just give me...

23:21.183 --> 23:23.378
- You didn't try the treats.
- I tried everything.

23:23.552 --> 23:27.113
No. She loves the kitty treats.
Just you watch.

23:27.289 --> 23:29.621
- He's going to eat.
- She. She. She.

23:29.791 --> 23:31.588
She is going to eat.

23:31.760 --> 23:33.421
Okay.

23:33.795 --> 23:35.285
Here.

23:35.730 --> 23:38.631
Call the Clearing House
and have them run the two addresses.

23:38.800 --> 23:42.861
And, honey...
Honey, play nicely with the other children.

23:45.340 --> 23:46.398
Come on, baby.

23:47.209 --> 23:48.233
Yeah.

23:48.410 --> 23:52.244
- She's eating.
- I see, I see. You're a genius.

23:55.183 --> 23:56.878
All right.

23:58.286 --> 24:00.584
Follow directions.

24:02.891 --> 24:07.191
Ah, Chief Johnson. This is Detective
Nick Carey. He's L.A.P.D.'s lead officer...

24:07.362 --> 24:09.830
...in a joint task-force
we're running with the FBI...

24:09.998 --> 24:12.489
...investigating a drug trafficker
named Tavio Baran.

24:12.667 --> 24:16.000
I called Detective Carey's office
this morning and left a message...

24:16.171 --> 24:18.139
...after checking with the Clearing House.

24:18.306 --> 24:20.604
- Thank you so much for coming in...
- Wait a minute.

24:20.942 --> 24:22.807
I'm sorry. I didn't get your message.

24:23.111 --> 24:26.911
- I came here bec...
- Nick, Nick, Nick. Let me explain this.

24:27.649 --> 24:31.107
Chief Johnson, our investigation
seems to have exposed...

24:31.286 --> 24:34.312
...one of Nick's protected witnesses
against Tavio.

24:34.489 --> 24:36.218
A boy named Hector Cruz.

24:36.725 --> 24:40.684
You paid Hector a visit without consulting
anyone involved in my case.

24:40.862 --> 24:43.353
At the time, I wasn't aware
that there was a case or...

24:43.532 --> 24:45.659
- You should've checked with L.A. Clear.
- Okay.

24:45.834 --> 24:49.326
What we have here is an example
of miscommunication that has developed...

24:49.504 --> 24:51.938
...between different divisions
within the L.A.P.D.

24:52.107 --> 24:56.476
So, what we will do now is practice
our new policy of cooperation.

24:57.112 --> 25:00.479
Okay? We'll begin with a little background
on this Hector Cruz.

25:03.585 --> 25:05.177
Now.

25:11.059 --> 25:13.027
We picked up Hector for dealing.

25:13.195 --> 25:17.393
We got him to roll on Tavio Baran,
who we caught with 50 kilos of cocaine.

25:17.766 --> 25:20.394
Cruz has been working with us
for the past nine months...

25:20.569 --> 25:23.595
...helping us dismantle
Tavio's distribution network.

25:23.972 --> 25:26.463
And all of that time and effort
was threatened...

25:26.641 --> 25:31.101
...when Chief Johnson walked up
and knocked on Hector's door this morning.

25:31.279 --> 25:35.943
An action for which, I'm sure,
Chief Johnson has a really good explanation.

25:36.117 --> 25:40.486
Yes, I do. A quadruple homicide
I'm investigating at 214 26th Street.

25:40.655 --> 25:43.351
As it so happens,
Hector Cruz lives at 214 26th Place.

25:43.525 --> 25:47.757
Come on. You're telling me that you went
to the house of a protected witness...

25:47.929 --> 25:49.226
By mistake, yes.

25:49.798 --> 25:52.426
But now I believe that Hector
may have been the target...

25:52.601 --> 25:55.161
...of a hit carried out at the wrong address.
- No way.

25:55.337 --> 25:57.305
We've got active wires all over the place.

25:57.472 --> 25:59.940
Detective Carey,
sometimes people don't like to say:

26:00.108 --> 26:03.236
"Hey, I'm gonna kill a witness,"
over their cell phone.

26:03.411 --> 26:06.812
Now, if you don't mind,
I'd like the entire case file on Tavio Baran.

26:06.982 --> 26:08.973
Sorry, ma'am.
That information's confidential.

26:09.150 --> 26:12.711
But you've turned over discovery
to Mr. Baran's defense, have you not?

26:12.887 --> 26:15.583
Actually, Tavio Baran
is acting as his own counsel.

26:16.658 --> 26:19.991
- So he's received discovery himself?
- About a thousand pages last week.

26:20.161 --> 26:22.322
Baran can have this information,
but I can't?

26:22.497 --> 26:23.987
With all due respect, chief...

26:24.165 --> 26:27.134
...no one from Homicide has ever helped me
with a dope charge...

26:27.302 --> 26:29.497
...unless it was to benefit them
in some way.

26:29.671 --> 26:30.729
- Oh, man.
- Detective Carey...

26:30.905 --> 26:33.169
...this is not the time to play tit for tat.

26:33.341 --> 26:36.936
I'm looking for someone who walked into
a house and shot four people to death.

26:37.112 --> 26:38.977
Including two children.

26:39.147 --> 26:43.106
Now that your case and mine are related,
I am obligated to pursue that possibility.

26:43.285 --> 26:47.346
And what if you're wrong? You build a
fantastic case for the real killer's defense...

26:47.522 --> 26:49.422
...should your murders ever go to trial.

26:49.591 --> 26:53.960
Nick, no one is arguing about
the potential sacrifice you're making here.

26:54.429 --> 26:57.830
Detective Carey,
as far as the public safety is concerned...

26:57.999 --> 27:01.935
...there is simply no scenario
in which your case takes precedence.

27:03.204 --> 27:05.468
Chief Johnson,
what materials will you be needing?

27:05.640 --> 27:07.904
Informant's backgrounds, please,
and surveillance.

27:08.076 --> 27:10.408
I'd like the discovery
you handed over to the DA...

27:10.578 --> 27:13.604
...as well as all video
of Mr. Baran's visitors.

27:13.782 --> 27:18.776
- I'll try to put that together soon.
- Like right now, Detective Carey.

27:27.595 --> 27:29.495
How much of this
do we have to go through?

27:29.664 --> 27:33.760
Detective Carey filed
967 pages of discovery...

27:33.935 --> 27:35.800
...in the case against Tavio Baran.

27:35.970 --> 27:39.064
Disregard anything that doesn't
give information about Hector Cruz.

27:39.240 --> 27:41.174
We're gonna be done lickety-split.

27:41.343 --> 27:43.971
All right, here's the candy
from the crime scene.

27:44.145 --> 27:45.908
Looks like it was a school fundraiser.

27:46.081 --> 27:48.879
They got the name of the high school
and the address...

27:49.050 --> 27:51.314
...right here on the back
of the candy bar.

27:52.687 --> 27:57.021
Hey, wait a minute. This is for
the 29th Street High School band program.

27:58.159 --> 28:02.152
But the Rivera children
were wearing Catholic school uniforms.

28:02.330 --> 28:04.764
29th Street High School's public.

28:07.235 --> 28:10.329
There was no forced entry.
There was no signs of a struggle.

28:10.505 --> 28:14.407
So what? The killer's some kid
selling candy door-to-door?

28:14.576 --> 28:18.068
- That still doesn't get him in the house.
- It would lower someone's guard.

28:18.246 --> 28:22.114
All right. All right, I'll get a list
of every student from 29th Street School...

28:22.283 --> 28:24.774
...and find out which ones
were selling candy.

28:24.953 --> 28:26.545
Oh, my God. Chief.

28:27.222 --> 28:28.849
Look at this.

28:35.029 --> 28:38.465
Baran's visitation footage
for the last three months, as you requested.

28:39.167 --> 28:42.568
Mostly a lot of low-rent talk
with his girlfriend.

28:42.737 --> 28:46.764
One thing you'll see, it sounds like Tavio
telling her he needs a witness taken out.

28:47.308 --> 28:50.903
A bunch of hot air, though, because
he never gives her names or addresses...

28:51.413 --> 28:54.746
...and she never contacted anyone
from his crew about it.

28:57.652 --> 28:58.744
What?

28:59.187 --> 29:03.487
Mr. Carey, it's standard procedure
for you to stamp every page of discovery...

29:03.658 --> 29:05.558
...before handing it over to the defense.

29:05.727 --> 29:06.989
- Is it not?
- That's right.

29:07.162 --> 29:10.393
- And you stamp these pages yourself?
- I do. Yeah, yeah.

29:10.999 --> 29:13.900
Page 117 is stamped. Take a look.

29:15.970 --> 29:17.938
You have notes
about a witness statement...

29:18.106 --> 29:20.097
...followed immediately
by the witness's address...

29:20.275 --> 29:23.676
...which just happened
to belong to Hector Cruz.

29:29.884 --> 29:32.182
This is obviously information
that should've been removed.

29:32.353 --> 29:33.513
But it wasn't.

29:33.688 --> 29:37.089
And because of your negligence,
9-year-old Lucia Rivera is dead.

29:38.193 --> 29:41.651
- 16-year-old Miguel Rivera is dead.
- Hey, hey, hey. Wait a minute here.

29:42.063 --> 29:43.655
My witness is still alive.

29:43.832 --> 29:47.529
Whatever happened to this guy's family,
as awful as it is, it is not my fault.

29:47.702 --> 29:52.105
- Do you believe this mistake has nothing...
- It's still the wrong street, ma'am!

29:53.441 --> 29:56.205
Now, if it turns out that Tavio Baran
was behind this...

29:56.544 --> 29:58.512
...and it makes the father feel better...

30:00.281 --> 30:01.942
...then tell him I'm sorry.

30:04.018 --> 30:06.111
<i>You know,
they got some fool lying about me.</i>

30:06.621 --> 30:09.385
<i>They're gonna pay his ass
to take the stand and put me away.</i>

30:09.924 --> 30:14.418
This must be the visit Carey was
talking about. The bald guy is Tavio Baran.

30:14.596 --> 30:19.033
<i>- Gonna be hard to beat this.
- What can I do, baby? I wanna get you out.</i>

30:19.200 --> 30:21.293
<i>- You know I love you?
- Of course I know it.</i>

30:21.469 --> 30:24.529
<i>You know I wanna come home, right?
I wanna help you raise that baby.</i>

30:24.706 --> 30:27.197
<i>- Yeah, I want that so bad, baby.
- This is Dina Lopez.</i>

30:27.375 --> 30:30.003
As far as anybody knows,
that's his baby she's carrying.

30:30.578 --> 30:35.015
Pregnant or not, there is no Dina Lopez
registered at 29th Street High.

30:35.183 --> 30:37.651
<i>Who is this guy?
How do we make him stop?</i>

30:37.819 --> 30:40.219
<i>I don't know who he is.
But you're on the outside.</i>

30:40.622 --> 30:43.887
<i>Can you help me try to find this fool
for me, baby, huh? For me?</i>

30:44.058 --> 30:45.889
<i>I'll do whatever I can, baby.</i>

30:46.060 --> 30:48.995
<i>- Because you love me, right?
- You know I do.</i>

30:49.163 --> 30:52.792
Sure sounds like he's arranging a hit.
She looks like she loves him enough...

30:52.967 --> 30:55.197
...to do whatever he wants.
- Love.

30:55.370 --> 30:58.601
Love, love, love.

30:58.773 --> 31:00.570
<i>Come over here.
Lean over here for me.</i>

31:01.075 --> 31:03.441
<i>Come here, baby. Come on. Let's see it.</i>

31:03.611 --> 31:05.772
<i>- Give me more.
- Oh, baby.</i>

31:05.947 --> 31:09.542
<i>Show me what I want, baby. Oh, yeah.</i>

31:11.886 --> 31:13.786
What are they doing there?

31:14.188 --> 31:18.682
She's giving him a peek.
Flashing her breasts or something.

31:18.860 --> 31:21.522
<i>Do you see that?
You do that to me, baby.</i>

31:21.696 --> 31:23.687
<i>Oh, I see it. I see it. I see it.</i>

31:23.865 --> 31:25.628
<i>- Show me.
- This video is from Tuesday?</i>

31:25.800 --> 31:27.324
The day before the murders.

31:27.502 --> 31:30.369
If he ordered a hit,
he never told her who or where.

31:30.672 --> 31:33.698
She's the only visitor he's had
in three weeks.

31:33.875 --> 31:36.070
Every Tuesday and Friday at noon.

31:36.244 --> 31:38.178
So she'll be there tomorrow.

31:38.346 --> 31:40.974
Rewind the tape, Buzz.
I need to look at this again.

31:41.149 --> 31:42.741
- You want us to bring Dina in?
- No.

31:42.917 --> 31:45.943
I wanna find out
everything I can about her first.

31:46.287 --> 31:49.882
Dump her phones, run numbers against
the people Detective Carey identified...

31:50.058 --> 31:51.685
...in Tavio's crew.

31:51.859 --> 31:53.292
Thank you.

31:55.296 --> 31:58.094
How did he tell her where to go?

31:58.266 --> 31:59.995
<i>Come on, baby.</i>

32:03.171 --> 32:06.265
<i>Come on. Show me.</i>

32:13.047 --> 32:15.481
Hey, I got your note.
I just watched the video.

32:15.650 --> 32:19.086
- Where's Kitty?
- I stopped by at lunch to check on her.

32:19.253 --> 32:21.915
She was throwing up all those kitty treats
you gave her...

32:22.090 --> 32:23.955
...so I took her back to the vet.

32:24.125 --> 32:26.252
Well, what did she say, the vet?

32:27.195 --> 32:30.130
She wants to keep her overnight,
put her on an IV.

32:31.065 --> 32:34.330
Just another million dollars.

32:34.936 --> 32:37.097
- What?
- I said, it's just until tomorrow.

32:37.271 --> 32:39.705
Well, good. So he's gonna get better.

32:39.874 --> 32:42.206
She is gonna get better, maybe.

32:48.916 --> 32:51.976
- So you looked at the tape?
- I did.

32:52.153 --> 32:54.519
It seems pretty plausible
the guy's ordering a hit.

32:54.856 --> 32:57.723
We know that.
I mean, everyone's in agreement about that.

32:57.892 --> 33:01.658
- Well, okay. Don't get upset.
- I'm not. I just... I mean, how?

33:01.829 --> 33:03.888
How is he?

33:04.232 --> 33:06.564
How is he ordering the hit?

33:06.734 --> 33:10.363
I mean, the only thing he seems to be doing
is staring at her breasts.

33:12.473 --> 33:16.102
Well, maybe he's passing information
through another inmate.

33:16.277 --> 33:17.835
No, no, no, I checked on that.

33:18.012 --> 33:21.971
Baran's in solitary.
No contact with any of the other prisoners.

33:22.150 --> 33:25.051
No one to code with or send kites to.
He's completely cut off.

33:25.486 --> 33:28.250
Well, honey, I really don't know.

33:41.035 --> 33:43.196
Oh, for heaven's sakes.

33:53.214 --> 33:54.272
Right.

33:54.449 --> 33:56.940
Chief. Chief. Yes. Yes, thank you.

33:57.485 --> 33:59.009
That was 29th Street High.

33:59.187 --> 34:02.714
Turns out Dina Lopez
has a half-sister in the 9th grade there.

34:02.890 --> 34:04.653
And guess what.

34:04.826 --> 34:07.886
Dina's sister was selling candy bars
to raise money for the school.

34:08.062 --> 34:09.688
Bingo.

34:10.898 --> 34:14.664
Okay. Let's get a warrant
to search Dina Lopez's residence.

34:14.835 --> 34:18.203
Maybe she was stupid enough
to take the gun home with her.

34:22.176 --> 34:24.041
Tavio Baran.

34:24.746 --> 34:26.976
- Station 5, miss.
- Thank you.

34:53.574 --> 34:54.598
Who are you?

34:55.342 --> 34:58.107
I'm Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson
of the L.A.P.D.

34:59.580 --> 35:01.844
Where's Tavio? I'm here to see Tavio.

35:02.016 --> 35:04.780
I'm sorry,
but Mr. Baran's legal situation has changed.

35:04.952 --> 35:06.852
- Before we let anyone talk to him...
- What?

35:07.021 --> 35:10.457
- We need to ask them a few questions
and advise them of their rights.

35:11.292 --> 35:13.920
- You wanna continue with your visit?
- Well, yeah.

35:14.095 --> 35:17.656
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used...

35:17.832 --> 35:20.995
...against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.

35:21.169 --> 35:24.297
If you can't afford one,
one will be appointed to you.

35:24.472 --> 35:26.030
Do you understand these rights?

35:26.207 --> 35:28.767
- I don't need no attorney.
- All right then.

35:29.944 --> 35:31.809
Oh, my goodness, are you pregnant?

35:35.616 --> 35:37.277
Do you know what you're having?

35:38.386 --> 35:41.219
- Baby girl.
- Oh, congratulations.

35:41.989 --> 35:44.457
- Have you picked out a name?
- Isabela.

35:44.625 --> 35:46.593
Oh, that's a beautiful name.

35:48.196 --> 35:52.929
Well, I know you wanna visit with Tavio
so let's start with the questions, shall we?

35:54.035 --> 35:55.468
Do you recognize this boy?

35:56.404 --> 35:58.065
No. Who's he supposed to be?

35:58.239 --> 36:01.572
He's the witness testifying against Tavio
in his drug trafficking trial.

36:03.411 --> 36:05.003
An attempt was made on his life.

36:05.413 --> 36:07.745
- An attempt?
- Yes.

36:07.915 --> 36:11.407
But unfortunately for Tavio,
the killer went to the wrong address.

36:11.586 --> 36:14.851
So instead of murdering the witness...

36:15.022 --> 36:18.253
...you shot four
completely innocent people in the head.

36:18.426 --> 36:23.989
And at first, I thought maybe you
hired someone to do this, Dina.

36:24.165 --> 36:26.190
But then I found
your sister's candy bars...

36:26.367 --> 36:27.732
- What?
- At the scene.

36:27.902 --> 36:31.599
- I didn't have nothing to do...
- You use that to take them off their guard?

36:31.772 --> 36:35.208
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Did you knock on the door?

36:35.376 --> 36:37.708
Tell them you were desperate
to use the bathroom?

36:37.879 --> 36:39.813
It's hard to say no to a pregnant woman.

36:39.981 --> 36:42.609
Knocking door-to-door, selling candy,
desperate to pee.

36:43.084 --> 36:45.518
So they let you in,
and then you pulled your gun.

36:45.686 --> 36:47.517
The gun that we found at your house.

36:47.688 --> 36:50.953
It's registered in your name,
I'm assuming that you know how to use it.

36:51.125 --> 36:53.958
This gun fired all the bullets
we pulled out of the victims.

36:54.128 --> 36:57.791
I don't know noth...
I don't know anything about this. I don't.

36:57.965 --> 37:01.662
I know a lot about it. For example, I know
when people are ashamed of killing...

37:01.836 --> 37:04.236
...they force victims
to cover up their faces...

37:04.405 --> 37:06.737
...because they can't stand
to see them die.

37:07.308 --> 37:10.539
Only thing I couldn't figure out
was how Tavio gave you the address...

37:10.711 --> 37:13.441
...last time you were here.
- He didn't give me no address.

37:13.614 --> 37:15.912
Then I realized
that the last time he was here...

37:16.083 --> 37:18.813
...he wasn't panting
because he was so turned on...

37:18.986 --> 37:23.082
...he was fogging up the glass
in the partition, like this:

37:32.300 --> 37:34.461
You see,
as long as you don't clean the glass...

37:34.635 --> 37:38.571
And seeing as this is a public building,
that could take a long time.

37:38.739 --> 37:41.708
- If you write on it with your finger,
it'll stay for weeks.

37:41.876 --> 37:43.275
Oh, God, no.

37:43.444 --> 37:47.380
You didn't go to 26th Place.
You went to 26th Street.

37:48.182 --> 37:50.707
You really thought this family
was involved with drugs?

37:50.885 --> 37:52.546
The little girl, she was 9 years old.

37:54.121 --> 37:56.180
And the brother and her mother
and her grandmother...

37:56.357 --> 37:59.326
...which one of these looks like a witness?
- It wasn't me. I swear.

37:59.493 --> 38:03.293
I have a baby.
I just... I want her to have a daddy.

38:03.464 --> 38:05.864
- And now she loses her mommy too.
- No. Please, no.

38:06.033 --> 38:07.500
Let me explain how this works.

38:07.668 --> 38:09.863
Babies that are born in jail
to single mothers...

38:10.037 --> 38:12.471
- No, please. No.
- To single mothers like you...

38:12.640 --> 38:14.733
...they are immediately put up
for adoption.

38:14.909 --> 38:18.072
But if you tell me right now
in your own words what happened...

38:18.245 --> 38:21.043
...I'll arrange for a family member
to raise Isabela for you.

38:21.215 --> 38:24.309
- After she's born, she can visit you in jail.
- No.

38:25.186 --> 38:28.314
- No, I can't. I...
- All right. I'll see you in court then.

38:28.489 --> 38:32.050
No, no, no. Wait.

38:32.226 --> 38:35.389
- I need a chance.
- So say it. Say it!

38:35.563 --> 38:37.997
Say it or Isabela gets a new mommy.

38:40.768 --> 38:44.260
I shot them. Okay? Okay?

38:44.438 --> 38:48.272
I shot them so I can have my family.

38:48.976 --> 38:51.843
I want my family!

38:54.015 --> 38:58.111
And you really thought executing other
people's children would give you that?

39:00.121 --> 39:01.850
Put your hands behind your back.

39:46.967 --> 39:49.333
- Hey, chief.
- Oh, hey.

39:50.838 --> 39:52.772
Oh, thank you.

39:59.246 --> 40:01.441
How's Mr. Rivera doing?

40:01.615 --> 40:03.105
Okay.

40:06.787 --> 40:10.120
- Does he have anyone close?
- Not here.

40:10.291 --> 40:12.486
I'm gonna let him sleep
on my couch tonight.

40:12.660 --> 40:14.787
He's got a sister coming into town.

40:14.962 --> 40:18.363
She's gonna help him figure out
what to do with...

40:18.899 --> 40:19.923
- the house.

40:21.102 --> 40:23.969
Well, that's good of you, Julio.

40:24.238 --> 40:25.262
To help him like that.

40:25.973 --> 40:27.873
I can't...

40:28.409 --> 40:32.505
...really help him.
I'm just giving him a place to sleep.

40:34.615 --> 40:39.552
- Anyway, uh, you have a good night, chief.
- Thanks. You too.

40:39.720 --> 40:42.382
Yeah. Oh, uh...

40:42.690 --> 40:45.921
I heard that the funerals
are on Wednesday...

40:46.093 --> 40:50.223
...and I was wondering
if I could get the day off.

40:51.065 --> 40:53.363
- Of course.
- Thank you.

41:26.233 --> 41:28.030
Yoo-hoo.

41:28.869 --> 41:31.167
Here, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty.

41:31.639 --> 41:32.833
Here, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty.

41:36.744 --> 41:37.802
- Hey.
- Hey.

41:37.978 --> 41:40.446
- You close your case?
- Yeah.

41:41.882 --> 41:43.577
Where's Kitty?

41:45.219 --> 41:48.814
The vet didn't wanna release her,
after all.

41:48.989 --> 41:50.752
Why?

41:50.925 --> 41:53.723
Brenda, she's not doing too well.

41:55.596 --> 41:59.726
- Last night you said she was getting better.
- Yeah, but now she isn't.

42:07.408 --> 42:09.467
Oh.

42:10.811 --> 42:15.339
Yesterday, I left here
and she was eating breakfast.

42:17.418 --> 42:20.546
And now I'm not gonna see her again?

42:23.324 --> 42:25.815
Why didn't I know
that this could happen?
