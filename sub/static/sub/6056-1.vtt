-Here's some for 37 cents.
- Here's some for 32.

03:12.994 --> 03:15.037
31.

03:15.746 --> 03:19.709
- That's it. Don't they have any generics?
- I think this is the generic.

03:19.834 --> 03:22.295
I never heard of that brand.
Maybe we should get this.

03:22.420 --> 03:24.672
You're paying for advertising.

03:25.006 --> 03:28.134
- Tuna. We should get tuna.
- Please, no more tuna.

03:28.259 --> 03:31.262
- It's got protein. We need protein.
- Beans are protein.

03:31.387 --> 03:34.223
- Beans make you fart.
- We got a convertible.

03:35.600 --> 03:37.643
I'm gettin' it for myself.

03:45.818 --> 03:48.112
One burrito and one large Slush.

03:53.034 --> 03:56.245
- 21 dollars and 67 cents.
- Can you fill this up?

03:59.415 --> 04:00.917
21.67

04:34.200 --> 04:36.786
Jesus. Look, I forgot to pay for this.

04:37.286 --> 04:40.289
You could have gotten caught.
What if somebody saw?

04:40.414 --> 04:44.377
You know what the minimum age
for execution is in Alabama?

04:44.502 --> 04:46.963
- About sixteen?
- Ten.

04:54.595 --> 04:56.556
- There's a cop behind us.
- A cop?

04:56.681 --> 05:00.476
- There's nothing to worry about, all right?
- There might be.

05:00.601 --> 05:02.645
Just relax. Please.

05:06.858 --> 05:08.943
- Is he still there?
- Yeah.

05:09.068 --> 05:11.529
- Goddamn it.
- Calm down, all right?

05:11.696 --> 05:15.491
There's a cop behind us, that's all.
There's no problem.

05:16.826 --> 05:18.578
- What?
- His light's on.

05:18.703 --> 05:21.289
Fuck. Fuck. Goddamn it.

05:21.581 --> 05:25.543
- What are we gonna do?
- It's probably nothing. It might be a taillight.

05:25.668 --> 05:30.006
- We don't have any money for bail.
- Bail? Nothing's happened.

05:30.131 --> 05:34.010
- Nothing? You stole something, didn't you?
- Shut up. All right?

05:40.057 --> 05:42.101
All right. Here he comes.

05:46.355 --> 05:48.232
- Show me your hands.
- Jesus.

05:48.357 --> 05:50.443
Show me your hands. Get 'em up.

05:51.194 --> 05:53.279
Get 'em up. Up.

05:53.404 --> 05:57.116
Now put your hands on top of your head
and get outta the car.

05:58.284 --> 06:01.412
- Outta the car.
- Go.

06:02.330 --> 06:05.458
Yeah, I'm sure of it. It's number three and five.

06:05.833 --> 06:07.960
Ridiculous. All this over a can of tuna.

06:08.085 --> 06:10.379
Keep quiet.

06:10.880 --> 06:14.884
Yeah. You sure about that?

06:15.092 --> 06:17.845
Yeah. He's standing right here.

06:17.970 --> 06:20.014
All right. Bye.

06:20.848 --> 06:22.892
I think we may get a confession.

06:27.355 --> 06:30.942
- I just heard someone shot Jimmy Willis.
- He's dead.

06:31.067 --> 06:34.737
Oh, my God. Who would do such a thing?

06:42.078 --> 06:44.580
- Hello, Bill. I'm Sheriff Farley.
- Hi.

06:50.378 --> 06:53.256
- Do you know why you're here?
- Yeah, I do. I'm sorry.

06:53.381 --> 06:55.842
It was a stupid thing to do.

06:55.967 --> 06:58.719
- Have you been made aware of your rights?
- Yes.

06:58.928 --> 07:02.140
- You're willing to waive that right?
- I'll cooperate fully.

07:02.306 --> 07:06.561
I'll sign a statement, or whatever
makes this whole thing easier.

07:06.686 --> 07:10.565
Good. Good. That's good.

07:10.690 --> 07:14.235
But I want you to know,
Stan, he had nothing to do with it.

07:14.360 --> 07:16.779
Did he help you plan it?

07:16.904 --> 07:19.407
No. I mean... I mean, it wasn't planned out.

07:19.532 --> 07:21.784
You know, it just happened.

07:22.618 --> 07:24.704
Did Stan try to stop you at any time?

07:26.330 --> 07:28.583
No. I mean, he was...

07:34.881 --> 07:37.091
- Is that a big deal?
- Aidin' and abettin'.

07:37.467 --> 07:41.429
- Aiding and abetting? Is that a major thing?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

07:43.306 --> 07:47.143
An accessory?
Are you guys kiddin'? An accessory?

07:47.268 --> 07:49.520
I didn't help. I didn't plan it.

07:51.105 --> 07:53.316
You didn't try to stop it.

07:53.441 --> 07:56.694
I didn't know it was happening.
I found out later in the car.

07:56.819 --> 08:00.781
Why didn't you get out,
call the police then?

08:01.574 --> 08:03.784
He's my friend.

08:03.910 --> 08:05.953
Well.

08:06.787 --> 08:09.707
Your friend has put you in a lot of trouble.

08:10.958 --> 08:13.503
What's gonna happen to Bill?

08:13.628 --> 08:16.005
Nothing. Unless he's convicted.

08:18.174 --> 08:24.889
If he is, we're gonna run enough electricity
through him to light up Birmingham.

08:25.139 --> 08:29.685
We were friends at NYU, and we both
applied and we got scholarships to UCLA.

08:29.811 --> 08:33.231
So we figured the scenery would be
nicer going through the South.

08:33.356 --> 08:36.359
- What about the tuna fish?
- I forgot about the tuna fish.

08:36.484 --> 08:38.443
And then we left.

08:38.903 --> 08:42.615
Did he catch you with the tuna fish?
Is that how it started?

08:43.323 --> 08:46.828
- No, he didn't say anything.
- But he knew about it.

08:48.246 --> 08:50.706
I don't know.

08:52.416 --> 08:54.627
Let's talk about that for a moment.

08:57.421 --> 08:59.841
You paid for the groceries.

09:01.342 --> 09:04.887
- And then what?
- We went out to the car, and that's it.

09:05.847 --> 09:08.099
When'd you shoot him?

09:09.183 --> 09:11.727
- What?
- At what point did you shoot the clerk?

09:13.396 --> 09:15.857
- I shot the clerk?
- Yes. When did you shoot him?

09:16.065 --> 09:19.735
- I shot the clerk?
- We need ya out here.

09:19.861 --> 09:22.613
I'm in the middle of a damn confession here.

09:26.450 --> 09:28.828
Whoa. Wait a minute.

09:39.964 --> 09:43.050
- What's the matter?
- Do you know what this is all about?

09:43.176 --> 09:46.095
- Yeah, they're fucking with us.
- You don't believe them?

09:46.220 --> 09:50.266
- They don't execute for shoplifting.
- You think we're booked for shoplifting?

09:50.391 --> 09:54.729
No. You're being booked for shoplifting.
I'm booked for accessory to shoplifting.

09:54.854 --> 10:00.359
No, Stan. I'm being booked for murder and
you're being booked for accessory to murder.

10:02.487 --> 10:04.906
It's time to make your phone calls.

10:05.031 --> 10:07.492
- Goddamn it.
- Could you contact your parents?

10:07.617 --> 10:10.286
How? Call the Chilean consulate?
What can they do?

10:10.369 --> 10:12.914
Send a guide into the mountains
looking for them?

10:13.039 --> 10:15.708
We need to call an attorney. A great attorney.

10:15.791 --> 10:17.835
Do you know any great attorneys?

10:17.960 --> 10:20.213
No. I'm calling my mother.

10:22.757 --> 10:25.426
Hello, Ma. We're in Wazoo.

10:25.760 --> 10:28.554
It's in Beechum County, Alabama, Ma.

10:29.388 --> 10:33.392
Not too good, Ma. We... we've been arrested.

10:34.101 --> 10:38.940
Ma. Ma, please. Ma, please.
First of all, we didn't do it, all right?

10:41.609 --> 10:42.652
Murder.

10:42.777 --> 10:45.530
Ma. Ma, ple... Ma, it's a mistake.

10:45.655 --> 10:47.698
We must look like the guys who did it.

10:47.824 --> 10:50.785
- Tell her what we think is happening...
- Shut up.

10:50.910 --> 10:55.540
We think they're trying to set us up as
patsies. You know how corrupt it is here.

10:55.665 --> 10:59.335
The Klan's here, they're inbred,
they sleep with their sisters.

11:00.878 --> 11:03.089
- Some of them do.
- All right, Ma, listen.

11:03.214 --> 11:07.218
We gotta get an attorney,
and it's gonna cost a lot of money.

11:07.969 --> 11:12.140
- How much would an attorney cost?
- A decent one? $50,000. $100,000.

11:12.265 --> 11:15.434
50,000. 100,000... I know, Ma. I know.

11:17.186 --> 11:19.355
- Can we use any attorney?
- I think so.

11:19.480 --> 11:21.774
He says he thinks so.

11:22.733 --> 11:24.652
He is?

11:24.777 --> 11:27.864
Well, that's a great idea.
You think he'll do it?

11:27.989 --> 11:29.907
- We got an attorney in the family.
- Who?

11:30.032 --> 11:31.242
My cousin Vinny.

11:43.921 --> 11:45.965
What is that?

12:04.775 --> 12:06.819
Where's he from?

12:56.744 --> 13:01.290
- What?
- You stick out like a sore thumb around here.

13:01.666 --> 13:04.752
- Me? What about you?
- I fit in better than you.

13:04.877 --> 13:08.714
- At least I'm wearin' cowboy boots.
- Oh, yeah. You blend.

13:11.342 --> 13:14.345
I bet the Chinese food here is terrible.

13:15.847 --> 13:19.016
- I don't see anything.
- The wheels went out of balance

13:19.142 --> 13:21.978
- right after we hit that mud.
- No, that's not it.

13:22.103 --> 13:24.772
I think you should put it
on a rack and take a look.

13:24.897 --> 13:26.941
What's wrong?

13:27.066 --> 13:28.985
- What?
- What's the problem?

13:29.110 --> 13:31.154
The car was shimmying on the highway.

13:31.279 --> 13:35.324
- You got mud in your tyres.
- I got mud in my tyres?

13:35.449 --> 13:37.952
Let me ask you, how do you
get mud into the tyres?

13:38.077 --> 13:41.789
That's a figure of speech.
The mud gets around the inside of the wheel.

13:41.914 --> 13:45.960
- Throws the balance off.
- Did you ever hear that? Mud in the tyres?

13:46.085 --> 13:47.420
No.

13:47.545 --> 13:51.090
She never heard it.
She knows everything about cars.

13:53.217 --> 13:57.054
See, down here, everybody gets stuck
in the mud every now and then.

13:57.180 --> 14:01.142
- Yeah. We're famous for our mud.
- Famous for your mud?

14:01.267 --> 14:04.437
How's your Chinese food?

14:04.562 --> 14:08.983
You keep on askin' about that. Can't you
tell they don't have Chinese restaurants?

14:09.108 --> 14:12.153
Gotta let everybody know
you're a tourist. Come on.

14:12.278 --> 14:14.322
And you're a fuckin' world traveller?

14:31.756 --> 14:34.425
Our jail was condemned this morning.

14:34.509 --> 14:39.222
That's why we bringin' you all
out to the state corrections facility.

14:50.733 --> 14:52.902
Unlock the gate.

14:56.405 --> 14:58.157
Go on through.

15:47.039 --> 15:51.210
- Do you know what happens in these places?
- Yeah, I know what happens.

15:51.335 --> 15:54.380
There's often a big guy named
Bubba no one will tangle with.

15:54.505 --> 15:58.176
He'll protect you - if you become
his sex slave and do whatever he wants.

15:58.301 --> 16:00.970
There's only the two of us here.

16:01.637 --> 16:05.475
What about those cots?
What if they put somebody else in here?

16:05.766 --> 16:07.810
Stan.

16:08.561 --> 16:10.855
- Shut up.
- OK.

16:19.989 --> 16:22.992
I can't believe my luck.

16:34.962 --> 16:37.006
Here.

16:37.840 --> 16:40.134
We got somebody for you.

16:43.638 --> 16:46.057
You must be Stan. How you doin'?

16:46.891 --> 16:48.810
Why'd they bring you in here?

16:48.935 --> 16:52.146
I just got in. I asked for the new guys
and they brought me here.

16:52.271 --> 16:54.816
He's sleepin', huh? Cute little guy.

16:54.941 --> 16:59.237
You know, maybe I'll just start with you.
Let him sleep a little bit.

16:59.362 --> 17:02.615
- Look, I don't wanna do this.
- I don't blame you.

17:02.740 --> 17:06.077
If I was in your situation,
I'd wanna get through this whole thing

17:06.202 --> 17:09.622
as quickly and with as little pain as possible.

17:09.747 --> 17:14.085
So let's try our best to make it
a simple in-and-out procedure.

17:15.211 --> 17:17.880
What's the matter?

17:18.005 --> 17:20.133
Relax, relax. Relax.

17:20.258 --> 17:23.219
Maybe we should spend
a couple of minutes together.

17:23.344 --> 17:28.558
You know, to get acquainted before we,
you know, before we get to it.

17:29.433 --> 17:33.062
- What's wrong with you?
- I don't wanna do this.

17:34.522 --> 17:37.900
I understand, but what are your alternatives?

17:38.192 --> 17:41.237
My alternatives? To what? To you?

17:41.863 --> 17:43.698
I dunno. Suicide. Death.

17:45.074 --> 17:49.328
Look, it's either me or them.
You're gettin' fucked, one way or the other.

17:51.873 --> 17:55.668
Lighten up, OK?
Don't worry, I'm gonna help you.

17:55.793 --> 17:56.794
Gee, thanks.

17:57.211 --> 18:01.632
Excuse me, but I think a modicum of
gratitude would not be outta line here.

18:01.757 --> 18:06.345
- You think I should be grateful?
- Yeah. I mean it's your ass, not mine.

18:06.471 --> 18:11.309
I think you should be grateful. I think
you should be down on your fuckin' knees.

18:11.434 --> 18:13.686
I didn't know your visit was such an honour.

18:13.811 --> 18:17.523
I'm doin' a favour.
You're gettin' me for nothin', you little fuck.

18:17.648 --> 18:19.942
Boy, that's one hell of an ego you've got.

18:20.067 --> 18:22.570
What the fuck is your problem?

18:22.695 --> 18:26.532
- I did not come here just to get jerked off.
- No. No, no.

18:27.408 --> 18:30.620
I'm not jerking you off.
I'm not doing anything.

18:30.745 --> 18:33.915
You're on your own. I'm just
takin' care of Sleeping Beauty.

18:34.040 --> 18:36.334
- Billy.
- Back off.

18:36.459 --> 18:39.003
- Vinny. Hey, Vinny.
- Vinny?

18:39.128 --> 18:42.131
- Vinny Bag o' Donuts. How are you?
- This is Vinny?

18:43.049 --> 18:45.092
I don't know where to start.

18:45.218 --> 18:47.887
Have you had any murder cases before?

18:48.471 --> 18:51.307
- None. This'll be my first.
- Your first?

18:51.432 --> 18:53.476
Yeah.

18:54.852 --> 18:59.106
What kind of cases have you had?
Assault and battery? Armed robbery?

19:00.942 --> 19:03.236
No.

19:04.654 --> 19:09.534
Well, I expect he's done burglary,
grand theft auto, drugs.

19:10.034 --> 19:12.829
No. Nothin' like that either.

19:13.871 --> 19:17.208
What kind... what kind of law
do you practise?

19:17.333 --> 19:20.503
Well, up till now, personal injury.

19:23.589 --> 19:28.302
Well, you're a trial attorney, right?
I mean, personal injury trials.

19:29.387 --> 19:33.558
Well, actually, this'll be my first
foray into the trial process.

19:33.683 --> 19:37.979
I haven't had to go to court yet.
Knock on wood.

19:39.814 --> 19:41.858
You haven't had to go to court yet.

19:41.983 --> 19:45.361
- How long you been practising?
- Almost six weeks.

19:49.448 --> 19:51.367
But...

19:51.492 --> 19:54.287
You graduated six years ago.
What have you been doin'?

19:54.495 --> 19:56.539
Studyin', for the bar.

19:57.915 --> 20:00.042
Six years?

20:00.334 --> 20:04.338
- That's a lot of studying.
- Well, to be honest with you,

20:05.339 --> 20:09.010
l... I didn't pass my first time out.

20:10.470 --> 20:14.807
- That's OK. You passed the second time?
- I'm afraid not.

20:14.932 --> 20:18.853
- Three times a charm?
- Not for me it isn't.

20:18.978 --> 20:21.772
No. For me, six times was a charm.

20:25.193 --> 20:27.737
Six times.

20:56.599 --> 20:59.268
- A little informal, aren't we?
- I was resting...

20:59.352 --> 21:02.522
- Not wearing a coat or tie.
- Sorry.

21:04.982 --> 21:09.654
Well, approving an attorney from
out of state is a pretty informal matter.

21:09.779 --> 21:13.074
- I just have a few questions.
- OK. Fire away, Judge.

21:14.075 --> 21:17.036
- Where'd you go to law school?
- Brooklyn Academy of Law.

21:17.203 --> 21:19.539
Is that an accredited law school?

21:25.461 --> 21:27.130
Yes.

21:28.381 --> 21:32.927
- How long you been practising?
- About six...

21:33.469 --> 21:36.013
Almost sixteen years.

21:36.764 --> 21:40.518
- Any murder cases?
- Quite a few. Yes.

21:40.643 --> 21:44.897
- What was the outcome?
- You know. Win some, lose some.

21:47.692 --> 21:50.945
This is not the forum to be cavalier.

21:51.070 --> 21:53.489
Of course. Now, let me see.

21:53.614 --> 21:55.908
Most recently, I had a axe murder,

21:56.033 --> 21:58.786
which I won, on the grounds
of temporary insanity.

21:58.911 --> 22:01.247
- Wanna hear the facts of the case?
- No.

22:01.372 --> 22:03.708
- What else?
- Let me see. What else?

22:03.833 --> 22:05.960
You ever heard of the Son of Sam?

22:06.085 --> 22:08.963
The fella who received
orders to kill from a dog?

22:09.088 --> 22:12.717
- That one.
- You defended him?

22:12.842 --> 22:16.679
Well, no, not exactly.
I defended the first guy they arrested.

22:17.430 --> 22:23.978
And he was found innocent and set free
and they caught the real guy.

22:26.606 --> 22:28.900
Well.

22:29.025 --> 22:32.278
We don't have any serial killers
in Beechum County.

22:32.403 --> 22:38.159
What we do have is as sophisticated a justice
system as they do in the rest of the country.

22:38.451 --> 22:40.578
- I'm sure.
- You being from New York an' all

22:40.703 --> 22:46.542
might have the impression that law is
practised with a degree of informality here.

22:47.418 --> 22:49.545
- It isn't.
- Right.

22:49.670 --> 22:55.009
I tell you this because I want you
to know that when it comes to procedure,

22:55.134 --> 22:57.345
I'm not a patient man.

22:58.179 --> 23:02.475
Sir, when you come into my courtroom,
you ought to know the letter of the law.

23:02.600 --> 23:05.436
- I'll react harshly when you don't.
- You should.

23:05.561 --> 23:08.231
Being from New York
won't get you special treatment.

23:08.356 --> 23:10.399
It shouldn't.

23:11.317 --> 23:15.488
You won't. You'll be given
no leeway whatsoever.

23:20.743 --> 23:24.372
I expect you to know this information
when you come into my courtroom.

23:24.497 --> 23:25.498
Right.

23:25.623 --> 23:29.669
- You willing to accept those terms?
- Right. No problem.

23:31.754 --> 23:34.340
Just this?

24:19.760 --> 24:22.472
This is gonna be great. Vinny's first case.

24:23.514 --> 24:26.309
So? What can I do to help?

24:30.855 --> 24:33.316
- Nothin'?
- No.

24:50.249 --> 24:52.502
What the fuck is that?

25:07.099 --> 25:09.477
Wanna sit at the counter?

25:11.270 --> 25:14.023
Hey. How ya doin'?

25:14.148 --> 25:20.279
Listen, what's the story with this
incredibly, remarkably loud whistle

25:20.404 --> 25:22.323
at 5.30 in the morning?

25:22.782 --> 25:25.159
It's the steam whistle.

25:25.284 --> 25:27.245
Over at the sawmill.

25:27.370 --> 25:29.580
Tell folks it's time to get up.

25:29.705 --> 25:32.458
You can hear it for miles.

25:32.625 --> 25:35.086
- Y'all want somethin'?
- Yeah.

25:42.927 --> 25:45.638
- Breakfast?
- You think?

25:47.598 --> 25:50.184
Good choice. Two.

25:59.110 --> 26:01.279
Excuse me.

26:01.404 --> 26:06.617
You guys down here hear about the ongoing
cholesterol problem in the country?

26:17.170 --> 26:20.214
- What's this over here?
- You never heard of grits?

26:21.257 --> 26:23.259
Sure. Sure, I heard of grits.

26:24.218 --> 26:27.013
I just actually never seen a grit before.

26:28.681 --> 26:31.809
- Honey, you gonna try it?
- You first.

26:35.897 --> 26:39.233
- What is a grit, anyways?
- It's made out of corn.

26:39.358 --> 26:42.028
- Them hominy grits.
- Hominy.

26:48.576 --> 26:52.246
- How d'you cook it?
- Simmer it in water for 15 or 20 minutes,

26:52.371 --> 26:54.457
put it on the plate and add butter.

26:54.582 --> 26:56.542
So? You gonna eat it or not?

27:25.988 --> 27:28.241
Here?

27:44.465 --> 27:48.219
- Is your attorney here?
- I am the attorney.

27:48.344 --> 27:52.056
Jim Trotter the Third.
District attorney of Beechum County.

27:52.181 --> 27:56.144
Vincent La Guardia Gambini. First. Brooklyn.

27:57.311 --> 27:59.564
Nice to see you.

28:31.137 --> 28:32.638
Yeah.

28:36.601 --> 28:38.644
- Vinny.
- Hey.

28:42.982 --> 28:46.861
All rise for His Honour
Judge Chamberlain Haller.

28:46.986 --> 28:50.573
The court of Beechum County
is now in session.

28:52.950 --> 28:54.994
Be seated.

28:58.039 --> 29:02.543
First case. The people of the State
of Alabama versus William Robert Gambini

29:02.668 --> 29:04.921
and Stanley Marcus Rothenstein,

29:05.129 --> 29:07.465
- "Steen." She called me "Stine".
- Just...

29:08.007 --> 29:12.637
Counsellor, your clients are charged with
first-degree murder. How do they plead?

29:12.762 --> 29:17.183
- Your Honour, my clients...
- Don't talk to me sitting in that chair.

29:20.102 --> 29:24.607
- But he told me to sit here.
- When you address this court, you will rise

29:24.732 --> 29:27.860
and speak to me in a clear, intelligible voice.

29:29.695 --> 29:33.366
- Sorry. My clients...
- What are you wearin'?

29:35.076 --> 29:36.410
Huh?

29:36.536 --> 29:40.998
- What are you wearin'?
- I'm wearin' clothes.

29:43.417 --> 29:45.878
I don't get the question.

29:46.838 --> 29:49.757
When you come into my court
looking like you do,

29:49.882 --> 29:54.554
you not only insult me,
but you insult the integrity of this court.

29:58.766 --> 30:01.811
I apologise, sir, but this is how I dress.

30:01.936 --> 30:06.149
Next time you come into my courtroom,
you will look lawyer-ly.

30:06.858 --> 30:09.652
I mean, you comb your hair
and wear a suit and tie.

30:09.777 --> 30:15.324
And that suit better be made
outta some kind of cloth.

30:15.449 --> 30:19.620
- You understand me?
- Yes. Fine, Judge. Fine.

30:19.745 --> 30:23.124
Good. You may continue.
How do your clients plead?

30:23.666 --> 30:26.878
My clients are caught completely by surprise.

30:27.420 --> 30:32.133
They thought they were getting
arrested for shoplifting a can of tuna.

30:32.383 --> 30:35.094
What are you telling me?
That they plead not guilty?

30:35.219 --> 30:39.599
- No. I'm just trying to explain.
- I don't wanna hear explanations.

30:40.308 --> 30:42.810
The State of Alabama has its procedure.

30:43.102 --> 30:48.232
And that procedure, at this point in time, is
to have an arraignment. Are we clear on this?

30:48.357 --> 30:52.361
Yes. But there seems to be
a great deal of confusion here.

30:52.862 --> 30:55.239
- Mr Gambini.
- You see, my clients...

30:59.619 --> 31:01.579
All the way?

31:03.915 --> 31:08.252
All I ask from you is a very simple
answer to a very simple question.

31:08.461 --> 31:11.964
There are only two ways to answer.
"guilty" or "not guilty".

31:13.424 --> 31:15.343
But my clients didn't do anything.

31:15.510 --> 31:20.515
Once again, the communication
process has broken down.

31:21.516 --> 31:25.436
It appears to me that you want
to skip the arraignment process,

31:25.770 --> 31:29.857
go directly to trial, skip that,
and get a dismissal.

31:33.110 --> 31:37.949
Well, I'm not about to revamp
the entire judicial process

31:38.074 --> 31:42.078
just because you find yourself
in the unique position

31:42.203 --> 31:45.706
of defending clients
who say they didn't do it.

31:45.832 --> 31:50.837
Now, the next words out of your mouth
are either gonna be "guilty" or "not guilty".

31:50.962 --> 31:54.382
I don't wanna hear commentary,
argument or opinion.

31:55.383 --> 31:59.303
If I hear anything other than
"guilty" or "not guilty",

31:59.428 --> 32:01.347
you'll be in contempt.

32:01.556 --> 32:04.475
I don't even wanna hear you clear your throat.

32:06.144 --> 32:08.271
I hope I've been clear.

32:08.396 --> 32:13.985
Now, how do your clients plead?

32:14.318 --> 32:16.612
I think I get the point.

32:16.737 --> 32:19.282
No. I don't think you do.

32:20.158 --> 32:22.285
You're now in contempt of court.

32:23.828 --> 32:27.039
- Will you go for two counts of contempt?
- Not guilty.

32:27.832 --> 32:29.667
Thank you.

32:30.084 --> 32:33.129
Bail will be set at $200,000.

32:33.421 --> 32:37.633
Preliminary hearing will be set
for 9.30am tomorrow morning.

32:38.176 --> 32:43.681
Bailiff, please take Mr Gambini into custody.
His bail will be set at $200.

32:44.807 --> 32:46.851
Come with me, please.

32:48.102 --> 32:50.646
All rise as the judge leaves.

32:53.316 --> 32:56.777
You have to bail me out.
You know that, right?

33:14.295 --> 33:16.339
Let's go.

33:32.605 --> 33:35.525
They're gonna nuke
this guy Norton this weekend.

33:35.650 --> 33:37.777
Looks like it.

33:37.902 --> 33:41.405
You got one huge responsibility,
taking on this murder case.

33:41.531 --> 33:43.908
You screw up and those boys get fried.

33:44.033 --> 33:45.952
I know.

33:46.077 --> 33:50.665
- So you think you know what you're doin'?
- Yeah, I think I know what I'm doin'.

33:50.790 --> 33:55.878
You didn't look like you knew what you were
doin' today in that courtroom. Why is that?

33:56.003 --> 33:59.924
Well, it's a lot of procedure,
that's all. I'll learn it as I go.

34:00.049 --> 34:02.009
- Learn as you go?
- Yeah, yeah.

34:02.135 --> 34:05.471
- Didn't they teach that in law school?
- No, they didn't.

34:05.638 --> 34:09.809
They teach you contracts,
precedence, interpretations.

34:09.934 --> 34:13.187
Then the firm that hires you,
they teach you procedures.

34:13.312 --> 34:18.775
- Or you can go to court and watch.
- So why don't you go to court and watch?

34:18.900 --> 34:23.572
Because, between your father's garage and
working nights, when was I supposed to go?

34:23.697 --> 34:27.243
I thought this summer I would
take off a couple of months.

34:27.368 --> 34:29.954
But it ain't no big deal.

34:30.079 --> 34:33.081
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

34:34.958 --> 34:39.005
How can you be so sure when you don't
know what it is you're supposed to know?

34:39.130 --> 34:43.342
It's a procedure. Like rebuilding
a carburettor has a procedure.

34:43.467 --> 34:48.389
You know how the first thing you do is
you take the carburettor off the manifold?

34:48.514 --> 34:54.020
Suppose you skip the first step, and as you're
replacing one of the jets, you drop the jet.

34:54.145 --> 34:57.982
It goes down, rolls along the manifold
and into the head. You're fucked.

34:58.107 --> 35:01.861
You've learned the hard way that
you gotta remove the carburettor first.

35:01.986 --> 35:04.906
That's what happened to me today.
I learned the hard way.

35:05.031 --> 35:08.034
Actually, it was a good
learning experience for me.

35:08.159 --> 35:12.455
All right. Well, is there any way I could
help out in this procedure situation?

35:12.580 --> 35:14.624
Yeah. Keep bailing me out.

35:15.500 --> 35:19.962
We can't afford to keep bailing you out.
I've cashed in half the traveller's cheques.

35:20.087 --> 35:23.299
I didn't wanna cash 'em in,
but I didn't wanna bounce a cheque.

35:23.424 --> 35:26.552
I tried hustling the money,
but I got stiffed, so I cashed...

35:26.677 --> 35:30.890
Whoa, whoa. What do you mean, you got
stiffed? Did you say you got stiffed?

36:22.358 --> 36:24.819
Hey. Vincent La Guardia Gambini.

36:26.863 --> 36:29.198
- His name's JT.
- JT.

36:29.949 --> 36:33.953
I believe you and Lisa played
a game of pool for $200, which she won.

36:34.078 --> 36:36.414
I'm here to collect.

36:36.706 --> 36:40.001
- How about if I just kick your ass?
- A counteroffer?

36:40.126 --> 36:44.797
That's what we lawyers - I'm a lawyer -
we lawyers call that a "counteroffer".

36:45.631 --> 36:47.884
Let me see. This is a tough decision.

36:48.176 --> 36:50.636
Get my ass kicked or collect $200?

36:51.637 --> 36:52.722
What do you think?

36:52.847 --> 36:57.351
I could use a good ass kicking,
I'll be very honest with you.

36:59.353 --> 37:01.606
Nah, I think I'll just go with the 200.

37:06.944 --> 37:08.988
Over my dead body.

37:09.113 --> 37:11.908
You like to renegotiate as you go along, huh?

37:12.033 --> 37:14.869
OK, then. Here's my counteroffer.

37:15.787 --> 37:20.374
Do I have to kill you? What if I was just
to kick the everlovin' shit outta you?

37:21.167 --> 37:24.462
- In your dreams.
- No, no, no. In reality.

37:24.587 --> 37:28.090
If I was to kick the shit outta you,
do I get the money?

37:33.054 --> 37:35.348
- If you kicked the shit outta me?
- Yeah.

37:35.473 --> 37:38.017
Yeah, then you get the money.

37:40.228 --> 37:43.773
- What happened? Rear-ended?
- No, I fell.

37:45.817 --> 37:48.820
OK. Let's see if we agree on the terms.

37:48.945 --> 37:52.073
The choice now is I get my ass kicked

37:52.198 --> 37:56.953
or, option B, I kick your ass
and collect the 200.

37:59.872 --> 38:03.918
I'm going with option B.
Kicking your ass and collecting $200.

38:05.837 --> 38:09.340
- Are we gonna fight now?
- Yeah. First, let me see the money.

38:09.465 --> 38:12.635
- I have the money.
- All right. Let me see it. Show it to me.

38:14.053 --> 38:16.889
- I can get it.
- You can get it?

38:17.014 --> 38:18.975
All right. Get it.

38:19.100 --> 38:21.102
And then we'll fight.

38:26.566 --> 38:28.818
You fell in your place or somebody else's?

38:28.943 --> 38:31.404
- My place.
- Shit.

38:35.158 --> 38:38.077
He blew the arraignment.
It's a simple procedure.

38:38.202 --> 38:42.081
You heard the judge. All he had
to do was say "guilty" or "not guilty".

38:42.290 --> 38:44.333
So? What are you saying?

38:44.876 --> 38:50.089
What am I saying? You saw what happened
in there. You wanna stay with him after that?

38:50.214 --> 38:52.592
Shit, Stan. I don't wanna fire him.

38:52.717 --> 38:56.262
He's family. And my mother,
the way her health is right now...

38:57.972 --> 39:00.892
I appreciate that. But should you die for that?

39:01.017 --> 39:04.270
Wouldn't your mother
be more upset if you die?

39:04.395 --> 39:07.773
The thing is, given the chance,
I think he could do a good job.

39:08.024 --> 39:11.861
- No, you're wrong.
- Come on, fellas, knock it off. Let's go.

39:13.946 --> 39:16.824
Stan, listen.
You have to see the Gambinis in action.

39:16.949 --> 39:20.244
These people, they love to argue.
I mean, they live to argue.

39:20.369 --> 39:23.039
My parents argue, too -
that doesn't make them lawyers.

39:23.122 --> 39:26.959
Stan, I've seen your parents argue.
Trust me, they're amateurs.

39:37.094 --> 39:39.597
Is that a drip I hear?

39:40.765 --> 39:42.809
Yeah.

39:43.893 --> 39:46.646
Weren't you the last one
to use the bathroom?

39:46.771 --> 39:48.356
So?

39:48.481 --> 39:51.275
- Did you use the faucet?
- Yeah.

39:52.527 --> 39:55.279
- Then why didn't you turn it off?
- I did turn it off.

39:55.530 --> 39:58.950
Well, if you turned it off,
why am I listening to it?

39:59.075 --> 40:02.703
Did it occur to you it could be
turned off and drip at the same time?

40:02.829 --> 40:05.123
No. If you turned it off, it wouldn't drip.

40:05.248 --> 40:09.127
- Maybe it's broken.
- Is that what you're saying? It's broken?

40:09.252 --> 40:11.546
Yeah, that's it. It's broken.

40:13.714 --> 40:18.052
- You sure?
- I'm positive.

40:19.470 --> 40:24.433
- Maybe you didn't twist it hard enough?
- I twisted it just right.

40:24.809 --> 40:27.311
How could you be so sure?

40:29.230 --> 40:33.985
If you will look in the manual, you will
see that this particular model faucet

40:34.110 --> 40:37.655
requires a range of 10 to 16
foot-pounds of torque.

40:37.780 --> 40:40.867
I routinely twist to
maximum-allowable torquage.

40:41.159 --> 40:44.454
How could you be sure
you used 16 foot-pounds of torque?

40:44.579 --> 40:49.584
Because I used a Craftsman model 1019
laboratory edition

40:49.709 --> 40:52.128
Signature Series torque wrench.

40:52.253 --> 40:55.631
The kind used by Caltech
high-energy physicists

40:55.756 --> 40:58.176
and NASA engineers.

40:58.301 --> 41:03.014
Well, in that case, how could
you be sure that's accurate?

41:03.139 --> 41:07.810
Because a split second before the torque
wrench was applied to the faucet handle,

41:07.935 --> 41:10.605
it had been calibrated by top members

41:10.730 --> 41:15.067
of the state and federal
department of weights and measures

41:15.193 --> 41:17.612
to be dead-on balls accurate.

41:18.946 --> 41:21.657
Here's a certificate of validation.

41:25.453 --> 41:28.289
Dead-on balls accurate?

41:28.414 --> 41:30.708
It's an industry term.

41:36.506 --> 41:39.008
I guess the fucking thing is broken.

41:55.608 --> 41:57.735
We gotta move.

41:58.653 --> 42:02.573
Then I heard two loud bangs,
like firecrackers.

42:02.949 --> 42:07.745
I looked up and saw two young men
run out from the Sac-o-Suds

42:07.870 --> 42:13.042
and jump into a green car
with a white convertible top,

42:13.167 --> 42:15.586
and drive off like the dickens.

42:16.003 --> 42:19.465
Miss Riley, are those two young men
present in the courtroom?

42:19.590 --> 42:23.469
- Yes, sir. They are.
- Could you point 'em out for me, please?

42:23.594 --> 42:25.847
They sittin' right there.

42:28.307 --> 42:31.727
Now, Mrs Riley, is this the car?

42:33.604 --> 42:36.315
- Yes, sir. It is.
- Thank you, ma'am.

42:37.483 --> 42:42.280
Let the records show Mrs Constance Riley
identified the defendants' car.

42:43.906 --> 42:46.159
I was makin' my breakfast.

42:47.243 --> 42:50.079
I saw them two boys go into the store.

42:51.372 --> 42:53.666
Then later I heard a gunshot.

42:55.793 --> 42:57.962
Looked out the window.

42:58.087 --> 43:01.841
They were running out.
Got into the car and drove off.

43:01.966 --> 43:04.260
Is this the car?

43:07.013 --> 43:10.057
Yes. It is.

43:10.183 --> 43:12.518
Thank you, sir.

43:19.192 --> 43:24.363
Then you saw those two boys run out o' the
Sac-o-Suds, jump in this car and take off?

43:24.489 --> 43:27.492
Yeah. They peeled away.
Car was all over the road.

43:27.617 --> 43:29.660
Thank you, sir.

43:30.203 --> 43:34.791
I asked him if he did it,
and he said "l shot the clerk."

43:35.792 --> 43:40.671
I asked him again, and again
he said "l shot the clerk."

43:42.006 --> 43:44.300
Your Honour, no further questions.

43:46.302 --> 43:48.471
- Mr Gambini.
- Yes.

43:48.805 --> 43:52.266
- Do you have anything to add?
- Thing? What thing?

43:53.434 --> 43:55.728
Not for me to say.

43:55.853 --> 43:58.314
No, sir.

44:00.733 --> 44:02.777
You can stand down.

44:03.444 --> 44:07.323
- Do you have any other witnesses?
- No, Your Honour.

44:07.448 --> 44:11.869
The court finds sufficient evidence
exists for this matter to go to trial.

44:11.994 --> 44:16.624
I'm setting this matter for trial
this Monday, February 2, 10am.

44:20.753 --> 44:22.964
Mr Gambini.

44:23.172 --> 44:25.216
Stand up.

44:30.346 --> 44:36.144
Now, didn't I tell you next time you appear in
my courtroom that you dress appropriately?

44:36.269 --> 44:38.646
You were serious about that?

44:43.568 --> 44:48.698
- Why didn't you ask them any questions?
- Questions? Ask who questions?

44:49.949 --> 44:52.618
You knew you could ask questions.
Didn't you, Vin?

44:52.702 --> 44:56.122
If you'd put up a fight, you could have
gotten the case thrown out.

44:56.247 --> 44:59.959
Hey, Stan. You're in Ala-fuckin'-bama.

45:00.835 --> 45:04.881
You come from New York.
You killed a good old boy.

45:05.006 --> 45:08.217
There is no way this is not going to trial.

45:11.554 --> 45:15.766
What the fuck is goin' on here, Vinny?
You fuckin' up this case or what?

45:15.892 --> 45:19.145
I told you. It's just procedure.
I'm bound to fuck up a little.

45:19.270 --> 45:22.106
A little? You got thrown in jail. Twice.

45:23.316 --> 45:27.403
I know I was in jail. I don't need you
to point it out to me, OK?

45:27.528 --> 45:30.615
You're my fiancee.
You're supposed to stand by your man.

45:30.740 --> 45:34.327
You know, encourage me a little bit.
A little encouragement.

45:34.452 --> 45:38.956
Is that what you want? I'm sorry.
You were wonderful in there.

45:39.081 --> 45:44.295
The way you handled that judge...
You're a smooth talker. You are.

45:44.420 --> 45:47.256
All right, knock it off. Knock it off.

45:47.381 --> 45:49.592
Do you think I like fuckin' up? Is that it?

45:49.717 --> 45:54.138
You raggin' on me is not gonna give me
any great spontaneous knowledge.

45:54.305 --> 45:57.099
- Yeah?
- So shut it.

46:22.083 --> 46:24.752
- You done readin'?
- Yeah.

46:27.004 --> 46:29.048
Do you wanna go to bed?

46:30.842 --> 46:34.178
I don't know. I don't feel good.

46:34.303 --> 46:38.432
You shouldn't feel good.
You haven't slept much in three days.

46:39.642 --> 46:44.063
That's part of it. You know what it is?

46:51.571 --> 46:55.700
I'm... I'm really scared.

46:57.493 --> 46:59.537
You should be.

47:01.289 --> 47:03.958
How the fuck did I get into this shit?

47:04.584 --> 47:07.420
"Sure. No problem. I could win the case."

47:08.171 --> 47:10.923
I already got myself sent to jail twice.

47:12.341 --> 47:14.802
I could win this thing, though.
I know I could.

47:14.927 --> 47:18.431
If I could keep my ass awake and outta jail
long enough, betcha I could, huh?

47:18.556 --> 47:20.808
You know what I think? Honestly?

47:22.101 --> 47:25.897
I think that once you're out there
and you're doin' your thing,

47:26.022 --> 47:28.524
I think you're gonna be really great.

47:30.359 --> 47:32.403
Really great.

47:38.534 --> 47:41.412
If you don't fuck up.

48:22.787 --> 48:27.166
If this was a conspiracy,
they'd have to get all those people to lie.

48:28.960 --> 48:31.420
Do you think that's what's happening?

48:32.964 --> 48:37.969
Look, I think we should meet with
the public defender. See what he's like.

48:38.094 --> 48:41.097
If he's honest, then we should go with him.

48:44.976 --> 48:47.019
All right.

48:52.567 --> 48:56.863
- That's death row in there.
- It is?

48:56.988 --> 48:59.073
The chair ain't working like it used to.

48:59.198 --> 49:04.454
The guy we fried last week - took us
three attempts and his head caught fire.

49:04.579 --> 49:07.248
See, there's no money in the budget
to get it looked at.

49:07.373 --> 49:12.044
I say it'd be cheaper to get it fixed than
keeping running up them extra electric bills.

49:23.514 --> 49:25.725
Hi, Stanley.

49:25.850 --> 49:28.186
My name is John Gibbons

49:28.311 --> 49:31.564
and I'm an attorney
in the public defender's office.

49:31.689 --> 49:33.733
- Hi, John.
- Hey.

49:35.443 --> 49:39.489
Now, the evidence against you
is pretty strong, so

49:40.531 --> 49:44.327
why don't you just tell me
your side of the story?

49:55.588 --> 49:58.049
- Hey, Vin.
- Hey, Billy.

49:58.174 --> 49:59.801
How are ya?

49:59.926 --> 50:01.803
- How do you feel? OK?
- All right.

50:01.928 --> 50:05.264
- Where's Stan?
- Stan, he's not comin'.

50:08.184 --> 50:10.520
He's...

50:10.645 --> 50:13.815
Well, he wants to go with the public defender.

50:19.403 --> 50:21.447
Listen, Vin...

50:23.199 --> 50:26.035
I'm going with the public defender, too.

50:26.160 --> 50:31.499
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I just didn't know
what little experience you have with this.

50:32.792 --> 50:37.421
- What, are you scared?
- Yeah, I'm scared.

50:37.547 --> 50:41.092
Maybe I could have handled
the preliminary a little better.

50:41.217 --> 50:43.761
But what's most important
is winning the case.

50:43.886 --> 50:46.305
I could do it. I really could.

50:47.306 --> 50:49.183
Let me tell you how, OK?

50:49.308 --> 50:53.646
The DA's gotta build a case.
Building a case is like building a house.

50:53.771 --> 50:56.357
Each piece of evidence is a building block.

50:56.482 --> 50:58.860
He wants to make
a brick bunker of a building.

50:58.985 --> 51:03.906
He wants to use serious,
solid-looking bricks, like these, right?

51:04.031 --> 51:06.617
- Right.
- Let me show you something.

51:11.164 --> 51:15.710
He's gonna show you the bricks.
He'll show you they got straight sides.

51:15.835 --> 51:18.171
He'll show you how they got the right shape.

51:18.296 --> 51:21.215
He'll show them to you
in a very special way

51:21.340 --> 51:24.510
so that they appear to have
everything a brick should have.

51:24.635 --> 51:27.096
But there's one thing
he's not gonna show you.

51:27.221 --> 51:31.601
When you look at the bricks at the right
angle, they're as thin as this playing card.

51:31.726 --> 51:35.771
His whole case is an illusion, a magic trick.

51:35.897 --> 51:39.525
It has to be an illusion, cos you're innocent.

51:41.027 --> 51:47.700
Nobody, I mean nobody, pulls the wool over
the eyes of a Gambini. Especially this one.

51:48.743 --> 51:52.288
Give me the chance. One chance.

51:52.413 --> 51:54.457
Let me question the first witness.

51:54.582 --> 51:59.670
lf, after that point, you don't think that I'm the
best man for the job, fire me then and there.

51:59.796 --> 52:02.256
I'll leave quietly. No grudges.

52:02.465 --> 52:04.842
All I ask is for that one chance.

52:06.636 --> 52:09.514
I think you should give it to me.

52:11.641 --> 52:16.270
You should give it to him? What was he
before he was a lawyer? A fuckin' comedian?

52:16.395 --> 52:19.524
If he doesn't ask the right questions,
your lawyer will.

52:19.649 --> 52:21.859
No, he can still fuck things up.

52:21.984 --> 52:26.072
Cross-examination is about knowing
what to say and what not to say.

52:26.197 --> 52:30.535
Let's say he asks all the possible questions,
and the witness has all the answers.

52:30.660 --> 52:33.746
He ends up proving the prosecution's case.

52:35.206 --> 52:37.500
How did he ever talk you into it?

52:41.921 --> 52:45.967
At my cousin Ruthie's wedding,
the groom's brother was that guy Ali Kazam.

52:46.092 --> 52:49.971
- You know who I'm talkin' about?
- The magician with the ponytail?

52:50.096 --> 52:54.725
Right. He did his act, and every time he made
something disappear, Vinny jumped on him.

52:54.851 --> 52:58.437
He nailed him. It was like
"It's in his pocket" or "He's palming it."

52:58.563 --> 53:00.648
Or "There's a mirror under the table."

53:00.857 --> 53:05.153
He was like "Wait. It's joined in the middle
and there's a spring around it."

53:05.278 --> 53:07.947
"lt pops it open when it's inside the tube."

53:08.072 --> 53:11.325
It was like Ali Kazam's worst nightmare.

53:12.076 --> 53:14.120
But he was just being Vinny.

53:14.245 --> 53:17.457
He was just being
the quintessential Gambini.

53:28.009 --> 53:30.928
There goes the quintessential Norton.

53:34.724 --> 53:36.767
Lookee here, JT.

53:44.317 --> 53:47.820
Hey, hey, little Yankee boy.
Look here what I got.

53:48.988 --> 53:52.700
- What is it?
- $200.

53:54.202 --> 53:56.579
Bring it here. Let me see it.

54:06.214 --> 54:10.384
How do I know that's not a bunch
of ones with a 20 wrapped around it?

54:11.594 --> 54:15.181
- It's 200 bucks.
- Fan it out. Show it to me.

54:20.436 --> 54:22.271
Yeah, right.

55:45.771 --> 55:48.983
Does that freight train come through
at 5am every morning?

55:49.108 --> 55:51.444
No, sir. It's very unusual.

55:53.029 --> 55:54.781
OK.

55:55.156 --> 55:58.409
I was making a lot of money,
winning most of my cases.

55:58.534 --> 56:00.036
Thank you, Shirley.

56:00.244 --> 56:02.371
But my clients were guilty as hell.

56:02.497 --> 56:06.918
Finally, after getting this fella off some
serious charges for the fourth time,

56:07.043 --> 56:09.462
I tell you the truth, my conscience got to me.

56:09.587 --> 56:12.757
I'd be serving justice more
by putting the guilty in jail.

56:12.882 --> 56:17.053
That's what I've been doing and
I'm a happier man for it.

56:17.178 --> 56:21.307
- How about you?
- Well, I got a bullshit traffic ticket.

56:21.724 --> 56:24.060
In court, I got the cop on the stand

56:24.185 --> 56:27.188
and argued with him until
he admitted he was wrong.

56:27.313 --> 56:34.403
And the judge, this Judge Malloy,
all the while, he's laughing and smiling,

56:35.404 --> 56:39.117
and then, afterwards,
he asked me to go to lunch with him.

56:39.242 --> 56:42.620
Then he says to me "You know what?
You'd be a good litigator."

56:42.745 --> 56:47.792
I don't know what the hell he was talking
about. I don't know what a litigator is.

56:47.917 --> 56:52.046
I never thought of becoming a lawyer.
But Judge Malloy was from Brooklyn, too.

56:52.171 --> 56:55.716
I mean, he did it.
So all of a sudden it seemed possible.

56:56.509 --> 56:58.553
So I went to law school.

56:58.678 --> 57:04.267
Then from time to time, he would come by,
see how I was doin', if I needed anything.

57:05.810 --> 57:07.854
He was a nice man.

57:07.979 --> 57:11.440
I mean, to go out of his way
like that for me, you know?

57:12.191 --> 57:17.363
He wanted his son to follow in his footsteps,
but he became a musician or something.

57:17.488 --> 57:20.575
I remember when I graduated,
he was so proud of me.

57:20.741 --> 57:23.327
That's quite a story.

57:23.453 --> 57:25.037
Yeah.

57:25.163 --> 57:28.499
- We got some case ahead of us here, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

57:28.958 --> 57:32.670
- How do you feel about it?
- Well, l...

57:32.795 --> 57:35.131
I'd like to have a murder weapon.

57:35.256 --> 57:38.593
But, other than that, I feel pretty good.

57:38.718 --> 57:40.636
- You do?
- Oh, yeah.

57:42.555 --> 57:44.557
What you doin' this afternoon?

57:45.892 --> 57:48.561
- You're goin' hunting?
- That's right.

57:48.644 --> 57:52.064
Why are you goin' hunting?
Shouldn't you be preparing for court?

57:52.190 --> 57:56.694
I was thinkin' last night "lf only
I knew what he knows." You know?

57:56.819 --> 57:59.363
If he'd let me look at his files. Oh, boy.

58:00.072 --> 58:04.827
I don't get it. What does getting to
Trotter's files have to do with hunting?

58:04.952 --> 58:09.540
Well, you know. Two guys
out in the woods, guns, on the hunt.

58:09.665 --> 58:13.127
It's a bonding thing, you know.
Show him I'm one of the boys.

58:13.252 --> 58:17.507
He won't let me see his files, but maybe
he'll relax enough to drop his guard

58:17.632 --> 58:20.843
so that I can finesse
a little information out of him.

58:22.386 --> 58:25.264
- What am I gonna wear?
- What are you gonna hunt?

58:25.389 --> 58:29.101
I don't know. He's got a lot
of stuffed heads in his office.

58:29.519 --> 58:32.647
Heads? What kind of heads?

58:32.772 --> 58:35.441
I don't know. He's got a boar,
a bear, a couple of deer.

58:35.525 --> 58:37.819
Whoa. You're gonna shoot a deer?

58:39.403 --> 58:43.908
I don't know. I suppose. I mean, I'm
a man's man. I could go deer hunting.

58:44.200 --> 58:49.580
A sweet, innocent, harmless,
leaf-eating, doe-eyed little deer.

58:49.705 --> 58:53.334
Hey, Lisa. I'm not gonna go out
there just to wimp out, you know?

58:53.459 --> 58:57.839
I mean, the guy'll lose respect for me.
Would you rather have that?

59:03.511 --> 59:06.889
What about these pants I got on?
You think they're OK?

59:12.228 --> 59:14.355
lmagine you're a deer.

59:14.480 --> 59:19.318
You're prancing along. You get thirsty.
You spot a little brook.

59:19.444 --> 59:23.364
You put your little deer lips
down to the cool, clear water.

59:23.948 --> 59:26.784
Bam. A fuckin' bullet rips off
part of your head.

59:26.909 --> 59:30.288
Your brains are layin'
on the ground in little bloody pieces.

59:30.413 --> 59:32.999
Would you give a fuck what kind of pants

59:33.124 --> 59:35.877
the son of a bitch
who shot you was wearing?

59:48.598 --> 59:51.100
I'd sure like to get a look at your files.

59:51.225 --> 59:53.728
- You would?
- Sure.

59:53.853 --> 59:55.897
You got a Xerox machine over there?

59:56.022 --> 59:58.232
No.

59:59.150 --> 01:00:01.360
That's OK. I'll have my secretary do it.

01:00:01.486 --> 01:00:08.117
Shirley, can you Xerox all the files on the
Gambini/Rothenstein case for Mr Gambini?

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:11.662
Yeah. Thanks, sweetheart.

01:00:20.046 --> 01:00:23.883
- What's all that?
- Trotter's files. All of 'em.

01:00:24.008 --> 01:00:27.220
- You stole his files?
- I didn't steal his files.

01:00:27.345 --> 01:00:32.141
Listen to this. I'm just ready to finesse him.
I'm starting to finesse him. I got him goin'.

01:00:32.266 --> 01:00:35.978
He offers to have his secretary
copy everything for me.

01:00:37.355 --> 01:00:40.983
- That's very impressive finessing.
- That's not all.

01:00:41.109 --> 01:00:44.028
He's letting us use his hunting cabin
when he gets back.

01:00:44.153 --> 01:00:47.698
It's in the woods. It's quiet.
He sleeps like a baby when he's there.

01:00:47.824 --> 01:00:50.743
Terrific. You're a helluva bonder.

01:00:51.661 --> 01:00:54.372
What's this? Are you reading this book?

01:00:55.373 --> 01:00:58.501
- Yeah.
- Do me a favour, OK? Don't read this book.

01:00:59.377 --> 01:01:01.462
OK? Thank you very much.

01:01:02.130 --> 01:01:04.173
All right.

01:01:05.007 --> 01:01:07.677
Don't you wanna know
why Trotter gave you his files?

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:09.637
I told you why already.

01:01:09.762 --> 01:01:14.684
He has to by law. You're entitled.
It's called disclosure, you dickhead.

01:01:15.434 --> 01:01:18.771
He has to show you everything,
otherwise it could be a mistrial.

01:01:18.896 --> 01:01:23.192
He has to give you a list of all his witnesses.
You can talk to all his witnesses.

01:01:23.317 --> 01:01:25.653
He's not allowed any surprises.

01:01:27.530 --> 01:01:30.867
They didn't teach you that
in law school either?

01:01:37.331 --> 01:01:39.292
Now let me ask you this.

01:01:39.417 --> 01:01:42.336
How many levels of thickness
have you gone through?

01:01:42.753 --> 01:01:45.756
- What'd you have for breakfast?
- Well...

01:01:46.048 --> 01:01:48.342
What's that brown stuff?

01:02:15.787 --> 01:02:21.250
Yesterday you told me that freight train
hardly ever comes through here at 5am.

01:02:21.375 --> 01:02:25.338
I know. She's supposed
to come through at ten after four.

01:02:27.715 --> 01:02:32.845
Can you participate in this - in which the
final decision may be death by electrocution?

01:02:35.306 --> 01:02:36.307
Ma'am?

01:02:36.432 --> 01:02:41.354
I think it should be left up to the victims'
families, rather than the courts.

01:02:43.231 --> 01:02:47.235
The defendants in this case are charged
with robbing a convenience store.

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:51.656
And then, in a most cowardly fashion,
shooting the clerk in the back.

01:02:52.198 --> 01:02:57.120
Now, if sufficient evidence is offered
to prove these facts, you think you could...

01:02:57.245 --> 01:02:59.288
Fry 'em.

01:03:00.331 --> 01:03:01.666
She'll do.

01:03:19.851 --> 01:03:23.813
Mr Gambini. Come in. Come in.

01:03:33.197 --> 01:03:37.201
I just got a fax from the New York
State Office of Judicial Records.

01:03:39.912 --> 01:03:42.415
They have no records

01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:47.503
of any Vincent Gambini ever trying
any case in the entire state of New York.

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:54.427
You're not gonna find any records of Vincent
La Guardia Gambini practising in any courts.

01:03:54.552 --> 01:03:57.054
- I just told you that.
- You don't understand.

01:03:57.180 --> 01:04:00.224
See, 20 years ago, I became a actor.

01:04:00.349 --> 01:04:04.687
There was this prominent stage actor
in New York. His name was Vincent Gambini.

01:04:04.812 --> 01:04:06.939
- Maybe you heard of him.
- No.

01:04:07.064 --> 01:04:12.320
Never heard of him? Doesn't matter. Anyway,
I had to change my name, which I did legally.

01:04:12.445 --> 01:04:15.948
So now I practise law under
my legally changed stage name.

01:04:16.073 --> 01:04:18.618
- What name is that?
- Jerry Ga...

01:04:22.705 --> 01:04:24.791
Jerry Gallo.

01:04:28.878 --> 01:04:30.880
You can still call me Gambini.

01:04:35.134 --> 01:04:37.220
Sorry.

01:04:37.929 --> 01:04:40.932
- What name did you tell him?
- Jerry Gallo.

01:04:41.057 --> 01:04:45.019
- Jerry Gallo? The big attorney?
- Yeah.

01:04:45.144 --> 01:04:49.315
- Think that was a smart move?
- Yeah. He's a seriously accomplished lawyer.

01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:51.901
His name'll show up all over the place.

01:04:52.026 --> 01:04:54.821
- His name was in the papers all last week.
- I saw that.

01:04:54.946 --> 01:04:57.615
- You didn't actually read the articles?
- No.

01:04:57.740 --> 01:05:00.409
- That's too bad.
- Why is that?

01:05:00.493 --> 01:05:02.537
Cos he's dead.

01:05:20.972 --> 01:05:23.474
What's the matter with you?

01:05:23.599 --> 01:05:25.643
I dunno.

01:05:28.479 --> 01:05:32.024
- You're acting like you're nervous.
- Well, yeah. I am.

01:05:32.525 --> 01:05:35.903
Why? I'm the one that's under the gun.
The trial starts tomorrow.

01:05:36.028 --> 01:05:39.157
You wanna know what
I'm nervous about? I'll tell you.

01:05:39.282 --> 01:05:43.119
I am in the dark here with this legal crap.
I have no idea what's goin' on.

01:05:43.244 --> 01:05:46.581
All's I know is you're screwin' up
and I can't help.

01:05:46.956 --> 01:05:49.959
- You lent me your little camera, didn't ya?
- Oh, Vinny.

01:05:50.084 --> 01:05:56.048
I'm watchin' you go down in flames, bringin'
me with you, and I can't do anything about it.

01:05:56.174 --> 01:05:57.508
And?

01:05:57.633 --> 01:06:00.845
I hate to bring it up - I know
you got enough pressure on you -

01:06:00.970 --> 01:06:04.098
but we agreed to get married
when you won your first case.

01:06:04.223 --> 01:06:09.145
Meanwhile, ten years later, my niece, the
daughter of my sister, is gettin' married.

01:06:09.270 --> 01:06:11.814
My biological clock is tickin' like this,

01:06:11.939 --> 01:06:15.818
and the way this case is goin',
I ain't never gettin' married.

01:06:17.278 --> 01:06:22.450
Lisa, I don't need this. I swear to God,
I do not need this right now, OK?

01:06:22.575 --> 01:06:25.787
I got a judge that's just aching
to throw me in jail.

01:06:26.537 --> 01:06:29.499
An idiot who wants to fight me for $200.

01:06:29.624 --> 01:06:32.752
Slaughtered pigs. Giant loud whistles.

01:06:33.544 --> 01:06:35.588
I ain't slept in five days.

01:06:35.713 --> 01:06:38.299
I got no money. A dress-code problem.

01:06:38.424 --> 01:06:43.554
And a little murder case which, in the
balance, holds the lives of two innocent kids.

01:06:43.679 --> 01:06:49.185
Not to mention your
biological clock, my career,

01:06:49.310 --> 01:06:53.564
your life, our marriage,
and let me see, what else can we pile on?

01:06:53.689 --> 01:06:58.402
Is there any more shit we can pile on
to the top of the outcome of this case?

01:06:59.195 --> 01:07:01.280
Is it possible?

01:07:04.242 --> 01:07:06.494
Maybe it was a bad time to bring it up.

01:07:26.222 --> 01:07:27.849
What the fuck is that?

01:07:56.002 --> 01:07:57.920
This is very romantic.

01:07:59.714 --> 01:08:05.553
Out here in this field,
under the stars, quiet.

01:08:07.263 --> 01:08:09.807
No one around for miles.

01:08:11.184 --> 01:08:13.728
It's very romantic.

01:08:17.982 --> 01:08:19.692
I don't see no stars.

01:08:38.252 --> 01:08:40.671
Honey, move. My back.

01:08:42.131 --> 01:08:44.425
I have to get up.

01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:47.720
Wait. Let me...

01:08:49.639 --> 01:08:51.890
This fuckin' jacket.

01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:11.118
Fuck.

01:10:01.419 --> 01:10:05.131
- You OK?
- What was in that plastic thing in the trunk?

01:10:05.256 --> 01:10:07.425
It's your suit.

01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:10.303
- What is my suit doing in the trunk?
- I had it cleaned.

01:10:10.428 --> 01:10:13.681
I thought it'd be a nice surprise -
go in there with a clean suit.

01:10:22.815 --> 01:10:27.737
I have 30 fuckin' minutes to take a shower,
get a new suit and get to the courthouse.

01:10:27.862 --> 01:10:32.158
- You fuckin' shower, I'll get your fuckin' suit.
- Little Yankee wuss.

01:10:32.283 --> 01:10:34.619
Look here. Got your $200.

01:10:35.828 --> 01:10:38.122
You gonna kick the shit out of me now?

01:11:47.859 --> 01:11:51.529
Mr Gambini,
are you mockin' me with that outfit?

01:11:53.156 --> 01:11:55.324
Mockin' you? I'm not mockin' you, Judge.

01:11:55.658 --> 01:11:57.952
Then explain that outfit.

01:12:01.581 --> 01:12:05.543
I bought a suit. You seen it.
Now it's covered in mud.

01:12:06.002 --> 01:12:09.881
This town doesn't have a one-hour cleaners,
so I had to buy a new suit.

01:12:10.006 --> 01:12:14.427
Except that the only store you could
buy a new suit in has got the flu.

01:12:14.552 --> 01:12:17.221
You get that? The whole store got the flu.

01:12:17.305 --> 01:12:20.558
So I had to get this in a second-hand store.

01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:27.982
So, it's either wear the leather jacket -
which I know you hate - or this.

01:12:28.983 --> 01:12:33.946
So I wore this ridiculous thing for you.

01:12:38.534 --> 01:12:40.870
Are you on drugs?

01:12:40.995 --> 01:12:43.247
Drugs? No. I don't take drugs.

01:12:43.706 --> 01:12:46.918
- I don't like your attitude.
- What else is new?

01:12:47.084 --> 01:12:51.047
- I'm holding you in contempt of court.
- There's a fuckin' surprise.

01:12:51.881 --> 01:12:53.925
- What'd you say?
- What?

01:12:54.425 --> 01:12:56.677
What'd you just say?

01:12:57.553 --> 01:12:59.889
What'd I say? What?

01:13:04.644 --> 01:13:08.523
Your Honour, counsel, members of the jury.

01:13:09.607 --> 01:13:15.363
The evidence in this case is gonna show
that at 9.30 in the morning of January 4th,

01:13:15.488 --> 01:13:19.700
both defendants, Stanley Rothenstein
and William Gambini,

01:13:19.826 --> 01:13:21.994
were seen gettin' out of their

01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:27.750
metallic green 1964 Buick Skylark
convertible with a white top.

01:13:27.875 --> 01:13:34.590
It's gonna show they were seen entering the
Sac-o-Suds convenience store in Wazoo City.

01:13:34.715 --> 01:13:39.053
The evidence is gonna show that,
minutes after they entered the Sac-o-Suds,

01:13:39.178 --> 01:13:42.431
a gunshot was heard by three eyewitnesses.

01:13:43.057 --> 01:13:47.311
You will then hear the testimony
of the three eyewitnesses

01:13:47.437 --> 01:13:52.483
who saw the defendants runnin' out of the
Sac-o-Suds just after the shots were heard,

01:13:52.608 --> 01:13:58.906
gettin' into their faded metallic green 1964
Buick Skylark and drivin' off in great haste.

01:13:59.866 --> 01:14:06.038
Finally, the state is gonna prove that
the defendants, Gambini and Rothenstein,

01:14:06.164 --> 01:14:11.502
admitted then recanted their testimony
to the sheriff of Beechum County.

01:14:11.794 --> 01:14:13.754
Now let's get down to it.

01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:19.218
Your verdict is gonna depend on
what you think of the sworn testimony.

01:14:20.136 --> 01:14:23.097
Not what I think. What I think don't count.

01:14:23.222 --> 01:14:26.726
You're the jury. It's your job
to decide who's tellin' the truth.

01:14:27.226 --> 01:14:30.313
Truth. That's what "verdict" means.

01:14:31.105 --> 01:14:35.902
It's a word that comes down from ol'
England, and all our little ol' ancestors.

01:14:36.027 --> 01:14:39.906
Now, we're gonna be asking
you to return a verdict

01:14:40.031 --> 01:14:44.869
of murder in the first degree
for William Gambini

01:14:45.495 --> 01:14:51.459
and a verdict of accessory to murder in the
first degree for Stanley Rothenstein,

01:14:52.585 --> 01:14:58.341
for helping Gambini
commit this heinous crime.

01:15:08.226 --> 01:15:11.729
Counsellor, you wish to make
an opening statement?

01:15:14.357 --> 01:15:16.651
Counsellor?

01:15:22.698 --> 01:15:24.367
- Vinny.
- What?

01:15:24.492 --> 01:15:27.161
Come on, it's time to make
your opening statement.

01:15:27.286 --> 01:15:28.496
Come on, Vin.

01:15:35.044 --> 01:15:38.172
Everything that guy said is bullshit.

01:15:38.297 --> 01:15:39.590
Thank you.

01:15:39.715 --> 01:15:43.845
Objection, Your Honour. Counsel's
entire opening statement is argument.

01:15:43.970 --> 01:15:47.181
Objection sustained.
The entire opening statement,

01:15:47.431 --> 01:15:52.770
with the exception of "thank you",
will be stricken from the record.

01:15:52.895 --> 01:15:58.067
The jury will please disregard
counsel's entire opening statement.

01:15:58.484 --> 01:16:04.907
And you, Mr Gambini, will not use that kinda
language in my court. Understand?

01:16:05.241 --> 01:16:07.285
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:16:10.413 --> 01:16:12.457
Putz.

01:16:14.333 --> 01:16:16.878
Counsellor. Your statement, sir.

01:16:36.147 --> 01:16:38.816
Well, now.

01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:42.945
Ladies and gentlemen of the j-j-j...

01:16:43.821 --> 01:16:46.491
of-of the j-j-j...

01:16:48.826 --> 01:16:50.953
jury.

01:16:53.289 --> 01:16:54.832
On-on...

01:16:54.957 --> 01:17:00.630
On January ffffffff....

01:17:00.755 --> 01:17:07.762
fourth of this year, my client did indeed
visit the Sac-o-Suds c... co...

01:17:11.933 --> 01:17:13.976
convenience store.

01:17:14.143 --> 01:17:16.187
But-but

01:17:17.605 --> 01:17:19.565
he didn't

01:17:21.275 --> 01:17:24.320
kill anyone. He...

01:17:28.991 --> 01:17:34.872
We intend to prove that the ppppp...

01:17:35.915 --> 01:17:40.628
prosecution's case
is circumstantial and-and-and

01:17:45.299 --> 01:17:47.343
coincidental. Thank you.

01:18:00.731 --> 01:18:03.401
That's it? What about
everything we talked about?

01:18:03.484 --> 01:18:05.445
- I get a little nervous...
- A little?

01:18:05.570 --> 01:18:07.238
I'm gettin' better.

01:18:08.156 --> 01:18:11.117
I heard a gunshot, so I looked out the window

01:18:11.242 --> 01:18:15.872
and I seen them two boys
run out, get into their car,

01:18:15.997 --> 01:18:21.085
and drive off like maniacs, their tyres
screechin', smokin', goin' up on the kerb.

01:18:21.210 --> 01:18:23.254
Is this the car?

01:18:23.379 --> 01:18:26.549
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

01:18:26.674 --> 01:18:28.843
No further questions, Your Honour.

01:18:28.968 --> 01:18:31.012
Your witness.

01:18:34.807 --> 01:18:39.604
All right. Mr T-T-T...

01:18:42.982 --> 01:18:44.650
Tipton.

01:18:45.276 --> 01:18:47.528
Now, when you viewed my clients,

01:18:47.820 --> 01:18:51.199
- how-how far away were you?
- About 50 feet.

01:18:51.324 --> 01:19:01.876
Now, do you think that that's close enough
to make an accurate i-i-i-identification?

01:19:02.502 --> 01:19:04.337
Yes.

01:19:06.631 --> 01:19:10.426
- Mr Tipton, I see you wear eyeglasses.
- Sometimes.

01:19:10.551 --> 01:19:15.681
Would you care to show those eyeglasses
to the jury, please? Thank you.

01:19:17.558 --> 01:19:21.562
Thank you. Mr Tipton,
were you wearing them that day?

01:19:21.687 --> 01:19:23.815
- No.
- You see.

01:19:24.565 --> 01:19:28.653
You were 50 feet away, you made
a positive eyewitness identification,

01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:32.073
and-and-and yet

01:19:32.198 --> 01:19:36.619
you were not wearing your
necessary prescription eyeglasses.

01:19:37.787 --> 01:19:40.456
They're reading glasses.

01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:53.886
Well, Mr...

01:19:57.140 --> 01:20:03.062
Could you tell the court
what colour eyes the defendants have?

01:20:06.274 --> 01:20:09.318
Brown. Hazel green.

01:20:13.656 --> 01:20:15.867
No more questions.

01:20:19.996 --> 01:20:22.206
Mr Gambini. Your witness.

01:20:23.791 --> 01:20:26.377
- He's a tough one.
- Yes.

01:20:28.379 --> 01:20:30.465
Mr Tipton.

01:20:30.590 --> 01:20:32.842
When you viewed the defendants

01:20:32.967 --> 01:20:37.597
walkin' from their car into the Sac-o-Suds,
what angle was your point of view?

01:20:38.014 --> 01:20:41.559
They was kind of walking toward me
when they entered the store.

01:20:41.684 --> 01:20:45.396
And when they left,
what angle was your point of view?

01:20:45.521 --> 01:20:48.524
They was kind of walkin' away from me.

01:20:48.649 --> 01:20:52.945
So would you say you got a better shot of
them goin' in, and not so much comin' out?

01:20:53.446 --> 01:20:56.741
- You could say that.
- I did say that. Would you say that?

01:20:57.325 --> 01:20:58.284
Yeah.

01:20:59.285 --> 01:21:01.954
Is it possible the two youths...

01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:05.124
Two what?

01:21:06.709 --> 01:21:08.961
What was that word?

01:21:09.712 --> 01:21:12.089
- What word?
- Two what?

01:21:12.215 --> 01:21:14.926
- What?
- Did you say "yoots"?

01:21:15.259 --> 01:21:17.845
- Yeah. "Two youths."
- What is a yoot?

01:21:18.888 --> 01:21:22.225
Excuse me, Your Honour. Two youths.

01:21:29.524 --> 01:21:32.193
Is it possible the two defendants

01:21:32.735 --> 01:21:37.240
entered the store, picked 22
specific items off of the shelves,

01:21:37.698 --> 01:21:41.994
had the clerk take money,
make change, then leave.

01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:46.040
Then, two different men
drive up in a similar...

01:21:46.165 --> 01:21:50.336
Don't shake your head. Wait till you hear
the whole thing so you can understand.

01:21:50.461 --> 01:21:53.589
Two different men drive up
in a similar-looking car,

01:21:53.714 --> 01:21:58.261
go in, shoot the clerk,
rob him and then leave?

01:21:58.594 --> 01:22:00.888
No. They didn't have enough time.

01:22:01.180 --> 01:22:03.891
- How much time was they in the store?
- Five minutes.

01:22:04.016 --> 01:22:07.145
- Five minutes? Did you look at your watch?
- No.

01:22:07.270 --> 01:22:12.942
Oh, I'm sorry. You testified earlier
that the boys went into the store

01:22:13.067 --> 01:22:15.319
and you had just begun to make breakfast.

01:22:15.445 --> 01:22:18.156
You were just ready to eat
and you heard a gunshot.

01:22:18.364 --> 01:22:23.411
So obviously it takes you five minutes
to make breakfast, so you knew that.

01:22:23.536 --> 01:22:26.205
- Do you remember what you had?
- Eggs and grits.

01:22:26.414 --> 01:22:28.332
Eggs and grits. I like grits, too.

01:22:29.709 --> 01:22:34.046
How do you cook your grits?
You like 'em regular, creamy or al dente?

01:22:36.340 --> 01:22:40.136
- Just regular, I guess.
- Regular. lnstant grits?

01:22:40.386 --> 01:22:45.099
No self-respectin' Southerner uses
instant grits. I take pride in my grits.

01:22:46.642 --> 01:22:48.394
So, Mr Tipton.

01:22:49.270 --> 01:22:53.399
How could it take you
five minutes to cook your grits

01:22:53.733 --> 01:22:59.113
when it takes the entire
grit-eating world 20 minutes?

01:23:05.036 --> 01:23:07.789
I dunno. I'm a fast cook, I guess.

01:23:08.498 --> 01:23:13.961
I'm sorry, I was over here. I couldn't hear.
Did you say you're a fast cook? That's it?

01:23:14.670 --> 01:23:20.760
Are we to believe that boiling water
soaks into a grit faster in your kitchen

01:23:20.885 --> 01:23:23.846
than on any place on the face of the earth?

01:23:24.806 --> 01:23:25.973
I don't know.

01:23:26.099 --> 01:23:29.894
Perhaps the laws of physics
cease to exist on your stove.

01:23:31.062 --> 01:23:33.648
Were these magic grits?

01:23:33.773 --> 01:23:38.569
Did you buy them from the same guy
who sold Jack his beanstalk beans?

01:23:38.694 --> 01:23:40.988
- Objection, Your Honour.
- Sustained.

01:23:41.114 --> 01:23:45.201
- Are you sure about that five minutes?
- I don't know.

01:23:45.451 --> 01:23:49.789
- I think you made your point.
- Are you sure about that five minutes?

01:23:52.834 --> 01:23:55.336
I may have been mistaken.

01:23:57.296 --> 01:23:59.799
I got no more use for this guy.

01:24:08.433 --> 01:24:10.309
You're fired.

01:24:10.435 --> 01:24:12.478
I want him.

01:24:13.813 --> 01:24:15.857
Come on, now. Move it.

01:24:16.858 --> 01:24:20.987
- Don't worry. I'll bail you out.
- Don't. I'm gonna stay in prison tonight.

01:24:21.112 --> 01:24:24.907
Maybe I can finally get some sleep.
I'm doin' good, huh?

01:24:43.176 --> 01:24:45.386
Hey, how ya doin'?

01:24:46.137 --> 01:24:49.515
Hey, Mr Crane. What are these pictures of?

01:24:51.476 --> 01:24:54.896
- My house and stuff.
- House and stuff.

01:24:55.021 --> 01:24:59.525
And what is this brown stuff
on the windows?

01:25:00.485 --> 01:25:02.695
- Dirt.
- Dirt.

01:25:03.905 --> 01:25:09.160
What is this rusty, dusty,
dirty-lookin' thing over your window?

01:25:11.287 --> 01:25:13.831
- It's a screen.
- A screen.

01:25:13.956 --> 01:25:15.792
It's a screen.

01:25:16.417 --> 01:25:21.506
What are these really big things
right in the middle of your view

01:25:21.631 --> 01:25:24.801
from the window of your kitchen
to the Sac-o-Suds?

01:25:25.426 --> 01:25:28.095
What do we call these big things?

01:25:30.348 --> 01:25:32.475
- Trees?
- Trees, that's right.

01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:35.269
Don't be afraid.
Just shout 'em out when you know.

01:25:35.394 --> 01:25:39.899
Now, what are these thousands
of little things that are on trees?

01:25:42.026 --> 01:25:44.070
- Leaves.
- Leaves.

01:25:46.197 --> 01:25:49.283
And these bushy things between the trees?

01:25:49.867 --> 01:25:51.369
- Bushes.
- Bushes.

01:25:51.494 --> 01:25:53.788
So, Mr Crane.

01:25:53.913 --> 01:25:59.710
You could positively identify the defendants
for a moment of two seconds

01:26:00.211 --> 01:26:06.008
looking through this dirty window,
this crud-covered screen,

01:26:06.676 --> 01:26:12.723
these trees with all these leaves on them,
and I don't know how many bushes.

01:26:18.062 --> 01:26:21.816
- Looks like five.
- Don't forget this one and this one.

01:26:22.066 --> 01:26:25.445
- Seven bushes.
- Seven bushes. So, what do you think?

01:26:25.570 --> 01:26:29.282
Is it possible you just saw
two guys in a green convertible,

01:26:29.407 --> 01:26:33.494
and not necessarily
these two particular guys?

01:26:35.288 --> 01:26:38.666
- I suppose.
- I'm finished with this guy.

01:26:46.716 --> 01:26:51.304
Mrs Riley, when you saw the defendants,
were you wearing your glasses?

01:26:51.429 --> 01:26:53.973
Yes, I was.

01:26:54.098 --> 01:26:56.267
Over here, dear.

01:26:57.977 --> 01:27:01.814
Would you mind puttin'
your glasses on for us, please?

01:27:06.736 --> 01:27:11.240
- Whoa. How long you been wearin' glasses?
- Since I was six.

01:27:11.616 --> 01:27:16.579
- Have they always been that thick?
- Oh, no. They got thicker over the years.

01:27:16.704 --> 01:27:21.667
So as your eyes have gotten more and more
outta whack as you've gotten older,

01:27:21.793 --> 01:27:25.171
how many different levels
of thickness have you gone through?

01:27:25.296 --> 01:27:30.676
I don't know.
Over sixty years, maybe ten times.

01:27:31.093 --> 01:27:36.599
- Maybe you're ready for a thicker set.
- Oh, no. No, I think they OK.

01:27:36.724 --> 01:27:39.519
Maybe we should make sure.
Let's check it out.

01:27:44.857 --> 01:27:50.988
Now, how far were the defendants from you
when you saw them entering the Sac-o-Suds?

01:27:51.114 --> 01:27:54.367
- About 100 feet.
- 100 feet.

01:27:54.492 --> 01:27:56.994
Would you hold this, please? Thank you.

01:28:00.414 --> 01:28:03.960
Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry.

01:28:07.296 --> 01:28:12.635
OK. This is 50 feet. That's half the distance.

01:28:13.261 --> 01:28:16.431
How many fingers am I holding up?

01:28:17.265 --> 01:28:21.394
Let the records show that
counsel is holding up two fingers.

01:28:21.519 --> 01:28:23.729
Your Honour, please, huh?

01:28:25.731 --> 01:28:27.442
Sorry.

01:28:27.567 --> 01:28:32.280
Now, Mrs Riley, and only Mrs Riley,

01:28:34.198 --> 01:28:37.076
how many fingers am I holding up now?

01:28:42.832 --> 01:28:44.876
Four.

01:28:49.714 --> 01:28:52.008
What do you think now, dear?

01:28:53.634 --> 01:28:56.804
I'm thinkin' of gettin' thicker glasses.

01:28:56.929 --> 01:28:58.973
Thank you.

01:29:08.065 --> 01:29:10.485
- Hello.
- You did good out there today, Yankee.

01:29:10.610 --> 01:29:15.239
I like the competition. You like competition,
too? Makes things kinda fun, doesn't it?

01:29:15.490 --> 01:29:19.494
- I'm enjoying myself so far.
- I got a little surprise for you tomorrow.

01:29:19.619 --> 01:29:23.456
What's that? You know you have
to disclose all your evidence to me.

01:29:23.581 --> 01:29:29.003
I just got it myself. I'll disclose it first thing
in the morning. Judge gonna have to admit it.

01:29:29.879 --> 01:29:33.341
- Should I be worried?
- I sure would be if I were you.

01:29:40.932 --> 01:29:45.103
Honey, where did you read
about all that disclosure shit?

01:29:45.228 --> 01:29:47.688
Let me show you. Why?

01:29:48.272 --> 01:29:53.069
I'm a special automotive instructor
of forensic studies for the FBl.

01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:56.364
- How long you been in that position?
- 18 years.

01:29:56.489 --> 01:29:59.951
Your Honour.
May we approach the bench, please?

01:30:00.076 --> 01:30:02.120
If you wish.

01:30:09.418 --> 01:30:12.004
I object to this witness
being called at this time.

01:30:12.130 --> 01:30:17.802
We've been given no prior notice he'd testify,
no discovery of any tests he's conducted,

01:30:17.927 --> 01:30:22.890
and the defence is entitled to advance
notice of any witness who will testify,

01:30:23.015 --> 01:30:28.521
particularly those giving scientific evidence,
so we can prepare for cross-examination,

01:30:28.646 --> 01:30:33.401
and to give the defence an opportunity to
have reports reviewed by a defence expert

01:30:33.526 --> 01:30:38.656
who might then be in a position to
contradict the veracity of his conclusions.

01:30:40.116 --> 01:30:42.034
- Mr Gambini.
- Yes, sir.

01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:45.830
That is a lucid, intelligent,
well thought-out objection.

01:30:46.330 --> 01:30:49.417
- Thank you, Your Honour.
- Overruled.

01:30:57.925 --> 01:30:59.969
Now, Mr Wilbur.

01:31:01.804 --> 01:31:06.726
These are photos of tyres
belonging to the defendants' car.

01:31:06.851 --> 01:31:12.523
And these are photos of the tyre marks left
by the assailants' car as it fled the store.

01:31:12.648 --> 01:31:15.902
- Now, are you familiar with these?
- Yes, I am.

01:31:16.027 --> 01:31:18.571
Could you elaborate, please, sir?

01:31:18.696 --> 01:31:22.325
We compared the tyre marks
outside the convenience store

01:31:22.450 --> 01:31:25.578
with the rear tyres of the defendants' car.

01:31:25.703 --> 01:31:28.998
They're the same model and size tyre.

01:31:29.123 --> 01:31:33.127
Michelin model XGV,
size 75R, 14-inch wheel.

01:31:33.461 --> 01:31:36.297
They're the same size and model tyre.

01:31:37.465 --> 01:31:39.467
- Anything else, sir?
- Yes, indeed.

01:31:39.592 --> 01:31:44.055
The car, leaving the convenience store,
spun its rear tyres dramatically

01:31:44.180 --> 01:31:46.390
and left a residue of rubber on the asphalt.

01:31:46.516 --> 01:31:49.811
Now, I took a sample of that rubber
and analysed it.

01:31:49.936 --> 01:31:51.979
I also took a sample of the rubber

01:31:52.105 --> 01:31:56.067
from the rear tyres of the defendants'
Buick and analysed that, too.

01:31:56.192 --> 01:31:59.487
What kind of equipment
did you use to find this out?

01:31:59.821 --> 01:32:01.864
I used a Hewlett-Packard 57-10A

01:32:02.073 --> 01:32:06.702
dual-column gas chromatograph
with flame analysation detectors.

01:32:06.828 --> 01:32:09.372
Is that thing turbocharged?

01:32:09.747 --> 01:32:12.500
Only on the floor models.

01:32:12.625 --> 01:32:16.629
Now, Mr Wilbur.
What was the result of your analysis?

01:32:16.754 --> 01:32:21.592
The chemical composition between
the two samples was found to be identical.

01:32:21.717 --> 01:32:24.387
ldentical.

01:32:29.267 --> 01:32:31.561
No further questions, Your Honour.

01:32:32.478 --> 01:32:35.398
- Your Honour.
- Thank you, Mr Wilbur.

01:32:37.525 --> 01:32:40.236
Court'll take a 60-minute recess for lunch.

01:32:40.653 --> 01:32:45.908
Your Honour, I respectfully request a full
day's continuance to go over this sh... stuff.

01:32:46.117 --> 01:32:48.786
- Request denied.
- Thanks a lot.

01:32:48.911 --> 01:32:51.247
- And, Mr Gambini.
- Yes, sir?

01:32:52.123 --> 01:32:54.959
I'd like to speak to you in my chambers.

01:32:55.626 --> 01:32:57.670
- You're a dead man.
- I'm a dead man?

01:32:57.795 --> 01:33:01.716
I faxed the clerk of New York and asked
him what he knew about Jerry Gallo.

01:33:01.841 --> 01:33:03.885
You wanna know what he replied?

01:33:04.010 --> 01:33:06.512
- Did you say "Jerry Gallo"?
- Yes, I did.

01:33:06.637 --> 01:33:08.681
- Gallo with a G?
- That's right.

01:33:08.806 --> 01:33:11.142
Jerry Gallo's dead.

01:33:11.267 --> 01:33:14.854
- I'm aware of that.
- Well, I'm not Jerry Gallo.

01:33:14.979 --> 01:33:18.858
I'm Jerry Callo. C-A-L-L-O.

01:33:25.156 --> 01:33:27.200
All right.

01:33:28.326 --> 01:33:30.369
All right.

01:33:35.416 --> 01:33:38.544
Let's get this cleared up right now.

01:33:46.803 --> 01:33:49.222
Hello. This is Judge Chamberlain Haller.

01:33:49.347 --> 01:33:51.724
Can I speak to the clerk?

01:33:53.226 --> 01:33:55.353
OK. I'll be here.

01:33:56.771 --> 01:33:59.524
He's gonna call back after three.

01:33:59.649 --> 01:34:02.318
That gives you a stay of execution.

01:34:03.194 --> 01:34:07.949
Unless by some miracle you happen
to win this case in the next 90 minutes.

01:34:11.119 --> 01:34:13.412
Why don't you go to lunch?

01:34:26.843 --> 01:34:29.095
Thanks.

01:34:37.103 --> 01:34:39.814
- I got my pictures back.
- Good.

01:34:40.982 --> 01:34:43.317
What'd the judge say?

01:34:43.443 --> 01:34:46.779
He said he found out that Gallo is dead.

01:34:47.738 --> 01:34:50.283
He found out. What'd he say?

01:34:51.742 --> 01:34:56.330
Lisa, I'm tryin' to think about
the case now, OK? I'm sorry.

01:34:59.333 --> 01:35:01.669
- Can I help?
- "Can I help?"

01:35:01.794 --> 01:35:05.006
No, you can't help.
I wish you could, but you can't.

01:35:08.468 --> 01:35:11.721
OK, you're lookin' at me.
What is that look supposed to mean?

01:35:11.846 --> 01:35:16.142
I'm a piece of shit cos I can't
figure out a way for you to help?

01:35:18.561 --> 01:35:21.647
OK, you're helpin'. I'll use your pictures.

01:35:22.774 --> 01:35:25.359
These are gonna...
I'm sorry. These are gonna be a help.

01:35:25.485 --> 01:35:28.154
I should have looked
at these pictures before.

01:35:28.279 --> 01:35:33.367
I like this. This is our first hotel room, right?
That'll intimidate Trotter.

01:35:33.493 --> 01:35:35.453
Here's one of me from behind.

01:35:35.578 --> 01:35:39.165
I didn't think I could feel worse
than I did a second ago. Thank you.

01:35:39.290 --> 01:35:43.503
Here's a good one of the tyre marks.
Could we get any farther away?

01:35:43.628 --> 01:35:46.047
Where'd you shoot this from? Up in a tree?

01:35:46.172 --> 01:35:48.466
What's this over here?

01:35:50.343 --> 01:35:53.346
It's dog shit. Dog shit. That's great.

01:35:53.471 --> 01:35:56.224
Dog shit. What a clue.
Why didn't I think of that?

01:35:56.349 --> 01:36:01.062
Here's one of me reading. I should've asked
you a long time ago for these pictures.

01:36:01.187 --> 01:36:03.856
Holy shit. You got it, honey.

01:36:03.981 --> 01:36:08.277
You did it. The case cracker.
Me in the shower.

01:36:08.528 --> 01:36:10.780
I love this. That's it.

01:36:10.905 --> 01:36:14.033
That is it. I'm outta here.

01:36:16.911 --> 01:36:18.955
Lisa.

01:36:23.876 --> 01:36:25.920
I'm sorry.

01:36:26.295 --> 01:36:27.880
Fuck.

01:36:42.478 --> 01:36:44.605
I know I'm missin' somethin'.

01:37:04.083 --> 01:37:06.252
Did you find anything?

01:37:06.377 --> 01:37:08.421
Very, very little.

01:37:09.380 --> 01:37:11.591
- Something?
- Nothin'.

01:37:15.428 --> 01:37:24.103
Is it possible that two separate cars could
be driving on Michelin model XGV 75R-14s?

01:37:24.854 --> 01:37:27.690
- Of course.
- Let me ask you this.

01:37:27.815 --> 01:37:32.862
What's the best-selling single model tyre
being sold in the United States today?

01:37:34.071 --> 01:37:35.948
The Michelin XGV.

01:37:36.073 --> 01:37:39.577
- And what's the most popular size?
- 75R-14.

01:37:40.077 --> 01:37:43.039
The same size as on the defendants' car.

01:37:43.706 --> 01:37:47.710
But two faded green
1964 Buick Skylark convertibles?

01:37:47.835 --> 01:37:51.172
Excuse me. What I'm askin' you

01:37:51.297 --> 01:37:58.387
is if the most popular size of the most
popular tyre is on the defendants' car?

01:37:58.888 --> 01:38:01.891
Well, yeah.

01:38:04.227 --> 01:38:05.853
Yes.

01:38:06.479 --> 01:38:08.523
Thank you.

01:38:09.482 --> 01:38:11.859
No further questions.

01:38:13.319 --> 01:38:15.863
The witness can stand down.

01:38:16.656 --> 01:38:18.407
Counsel.

01:38:19.242 --> 01:38:22.078
Yeah. Prosecution rests.

01:38:25.915 --> 01:38:29.127
Mr Gambini. Your first witness.

01:38:43.182 --> 01:38:46.436
I will ask you one more time,
and one more time only.

01:38:46.561 --> 01:38:49.814
- If I ask you again...
- Your Honour...

01:38:49.939 --> 01:38:53.025
Please, can I have a five-minute recess?

01:38:53.901 --> 01:38:58.489
- My next witness is not in the courtroom.
- Three minutes. No more.

01:39:11.294 --> 01:39:14.380
Sheriff, do me a favour. Please trace this.

01:39:14.505 --> 01:39:20.052
- It's not my job. Do your own investigating.
- Please. I only have three minutes.

01:39:25.683 --> 01:39:29.353
Lisa. Lisa, please. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, OK?

01:39:29.479 --> 01:39:32.440
I need you in the courtroom,
and I need the phone.

01:39:32.565 --> 01:39:36.819
Honey, come on. Stop it. I need the phone.
We have to make up. Let's make up.

01:39:36.944 --> 01:39:39.864
We gotta go back inside.
Everybody's waitin' for us.

01:39:39.989 --> 01:39:42.033
- We don't have a lot of time.
- Shut up.

01:39:42.158 --> 01:39:44.410
- Gimme this.
- Fuck you.

01:39:44.535 --> 01:39:46.746
What is it with you with that mouth?

01:39:46.871 --> 01:39:51.125
Mr Gambini. Tell me why.

01:39:53.002 --> 01:39:57.131
- Lisa, I need your help.
- I don't give a shit. Leave me alone.

01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:00.093
Come on, I found it.

01:40:05.556 --> 01:40:09.727
Your Honour, the defence calls as
its first witness Miss Mona Lisa Vito.

01:40:09.852 --> 01:40:13.314
I object, Your Honour.
This person is not on the witness list.

01:40:13.564 --> 01:40:15.983
This witness is a automobile expert

01:40:16.109 --> 01:40:19.946
and is being called to rebut
the testimony of George Wilbur.

01:40:21.114 --> 01:40:26.077
Your Honour, would you instruct the bailiff
to escort Miss Vito to the witness stand?

01:40:39.715 --> 01:40:42.718
Hold up your right hand.
Do you swear to tell the truth,

01:40:42.927 --> 01:40:46.139
- the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?
- Yeah.

01:40:51.519 --> 01:40:58.443
Miss Vito. You're supposed to be some kinda
expert in automobiles. Is that correct?

01:41:01.779 --> 01:41:03.990
Is that correct?

01:41:05.783 --> 01:41:09.871
- Will you please answer the counsel?
- No. I hate him.

01:41:09.996 --> 01:41:13.541
Your Honour, may I treat Miss Vito
as a hostile witness?

01:41:13.666 --> 01:41:17.170
You think I'm hostile now,
wait till you see me tonight.

01:41:17.295 --> 01:41:20.840
- Do you two know each other?
- Yeah, she's my fiancee.

01:41:20.965 --> 01:41:23.801
Well, that would certainly
explain the hostility.

01:41:23.926 --> 01:41:26.679
I object to this witness. lmproper foundation.

01:41:26.804 --> 01:41:29.515
I'm not aware of this person's qualifications.

01:41:29.640 --> 01:41:35.438
I'd like to voir dire this witness
as to the extent of her expertise.

01:41:36.481 --> 01:41:38.649
Granted.

01:41:38.775 --> 01:41:41.235
Mr Trotter, you may proceed.

01:41:43.613 --> 01:41:46.824
Miss Vito, what's your current profession?

01:41:46.949 --> 01:41:50.661
- I'm an out-of-work hairdresser.
- Out-of-work hairdresser.

01:41:50.787 --> 01:41:54.707
Now, in what way does that qualify
you as an expert in automobiles?

01:41:54.832 --> 01:41:58.336
- It doesn't.
- Well, in what way are you qualified?

01:41:59.086 --> 01:42:01.798
Well, my father was a mechanic.

01:42:01.923 --> 01:42:05.968
His father was a mechanic.
My mother's father was a mechanic.

01:42:06.094 --> 01:42:09.680
My three brothers are mechanics.
Four uncles on my father's side...

01:42:09.806 --> 01:42:12.892
Miss Vito, your family's obviously qualified.

01:42:13.017 --> 01:42:16.604
But, have you
ever worked as a mechanic?

01:42:16.729 --> 01:42:20.566
- Yeah. In my father's garage, yeah.
- As a mechanic?

01:42:24.195 --> 01:42:27.156
What'd you do in your father's garage?

01:42:27.740 --> 01:42:33.704
Tune-ups, oil changes, brake relining,
engine rebuilds, rebuilds on trannies...

01:42:33.830 --> 01:42:40.211
OK. OK. But does being an ex-mechanic
qualify you as being expert on tyre marks?

01:42:40.336 --> 01:42:43.131
No. Thank you. Goodbye.

01:42:43.256 --> 01:42:46.717
Sit down and stay there
until you're told to leave.

01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:54.225
Your Honour. Miss Vito's expertise
is in general automotive knowledge.

01:42:54.725 --> 01:42:57.979
It is in this area
that her testimony will be applicable.

01:42:58.104 --> 01:43:01.441
Now, if Mr Trotter wishes
to voir dire the witness

01:43:01.732 --> 01:43:04.569
as to the extent of her expertise in this area,

01:43:04.819 --> 01:43:09.157
I'm sure he's gonna be more than satisfied.

01:43:10.575 --> 01:43:11.576
OK.

01:43:13.744 --> 01:43:16.164
All right. All right.

01:43:16.289 --> 01:43:18.958
Now, Miss Vito.

01:43:19.667 --> 01:43:23.212
Being an expert on
general automotive knowledge,

01:43:24.755 --> 01:43:27.300
can you tell me

01:43:27.425 --> 01:43:32.972
what would the correct ignition
timing be on a 1955 Bel Air Chevrolet,

01:43:33.097 --> 01:43:38.436
with a 327 cubic-inch engine,
and a four-barrel carburettor?

01:43:38.561 --> 01:43:42.398
- That's a bullshit question.
- Does that mean that you can't answer it?

01:43:42.523 --> 01:43:44.734
It's impossible to answer.

01:43:44.859 --> 01:43:48.863
- Because you don't know the answer.
- Nobody could answer that question.

01:43:48.988 --> 01:43:54.035
Your Honour, I move to disqualify
Miss Vito as a expert witness.

01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:57.830
- Can you answer the question?
- No. It is a trick question.

01:43:58.247 --> 01:44:00.291
Why is it a trick question?

01:44:00.875 --> 01:44:04.295
- Watch this.
- Cos Chevy didn't make a 327 in '55.

01:44:04.420 --> 01:44:06.631
The 327 didn't come out till '62.

01:44:06.756 --> 01:44:10.384
And it wasn't offered in the Bel Air
with a four-barrel carb till '64.

01:44:10.510 --> 01:44:14.013
However, in 1964 the correct ignition timing

01:44:14.138 --> 01:44:16.808
would be four degrees
before top, dead centre.

01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:20.770
Well...

01:44:24.774 --> 01:44:27.235
She's acceptable, Your Honour.

01:44:30.113 --> 01:44:35.993
Your Honour, this is a picture taken
by my fiancee outside the Sac-o-Suds.

01:44:36.119 --> 01:44:38.454
Can we agree on this?

01:44:39.247 --> 01:44:41.499
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

01:44:42.250 --> 01:44:46.546
I'd like to submit this picture
of the tyre tracks as evidence.

01:44:47.380 --> 01:44:49.424
Mr Trotter.

01:44:50.633 --> 01:44:53.094
No objection, Your Honour.

01:44:58.891 --> 01:45:02.520
- Miss Vito. Did you take this picture?
- You know I did.

01:45:02.645 --> 01:45:06.232
- And what is this picture of?
- You know what it's of.

01:45:06.357 --> 01:45:11.237
Miss Vito, it has been
argued by me, the defence,

01:45:11.362 --> 01:45:16.325
that two sets of guys met up
at the Sac-o-Suds, at the same time,

01:45:16.451 --> 01:45:23.249
driving identical metallic mint-green
1964 Buick Skylark convertibles.

01:45:23.833 --> 01:45:27.336
Now, can you tell us,
by what you see in this picture,

01:45:27.462 --> 01:45:30.173
if the defence's case holds water?

01:45:38.639 --> 01:45:41.976
Miss Vito. Please answer the question.

01:45:42.101 --> 01:45:45.188
Does the defence's case hold water?

01:45:50.526 --> 01:45:52.487
No.

01:45:52.612 --> 01:45:55.490
The defence is wrong.

01:45:58.159 --> 01:46:02.455
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive.

01:46:02.789 --> 01:46:04.916
How could you be so sure?

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:10.463
Because there is no way that these
tyre marks were made by a '64 Buick Skylark.

01:46:10.588 --> 01:46:14.884
These marks were made
by a 1963 Pontiac Tempest.

01:46:15.009 --> 01:46:19.263
Objection. Can we clarify whether
the witness is stating opinion or fact?

01:46:19.388 --> 01:46:22.058
- This is your opinion?
- It's a fact.

01:46:22.183 --> 01:46:26.813
I find it hard to believe
that this kind of information

01:46:26.938 --> 01:46:30.399
could be ascertained
simply by looking at a picture.

01:46:30.858 --> 01:46:32.777
Would you like me to explain?

01:46:32.902 --> 01:46:36.781
- I would love to hear this.
- So would l.

01:46:37.156 --> 01:46:42.078
The car that made these two equal-length
tyre marks had positraction.

01:46:42.203 --> 01:46:48.417
Can't make those marks without positraction,
which was not available on the '64 Skylark.

01:46:48.543 --> 01:46:53.423
- And why not? What is positraction?
- It's a limited slip differential

01:46:53.548 --> 01:46:57.510
which distributes power equally
to both the right and left tyres.

01:46:57.635 --> 01:47:00.513
The '64 Skylark had a regular differential

01:47:00.638 --> 01:47:03.349
which, anyone who's been
stuck in the mud knows,

01:47:03.474 --> 01:47:07.395
you step on the gas, one tyre spins,
the other does nothin'.

01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:09.480
That's right.

01:47:09.605 --> 01:47:11.399
- Is that it?
- No. There's more.

01:47:11.524 --> 01:47:16.612
When the left tyre mark goes up on the kerb
and the right tyre stays flat and even...

01:47:16.737 --> 01:47:20.032
Well, the '64 Skylark had a solid rear axle,

01:47:20.241 --> 01:47:25.663
so, when the left tyre goes up on the kerb,
the right tyre tilts and rides along its edge.

01:47:25.788 --> 01:47:29.041
But that didn't happen here.
The tyre mark stayed flat and even.

01:47:29.167 --> 01:47:31.878
This car had an independent rear suspension.

01:47:32.545 --> 01:47:38.217
Now, in the '60s there were only two other
cars made in America that had positraction

01:47:38.342 --> 01:47:42.221
and independent rear suspension,
and enough power to make these marks.

01:47:42.346 --> 01:47:47.185
One was the Corvette, which could never
be confused with the Buick Skylark.

01:47:47.310 --> 01:47:51.606
The other had the same body length,
height, width, weight,

01:47:51.731 --> 01:47:55.067
wheel base and wheel track
as the '64 Skylark,

01:47:55.193 --> 01:47:58.863
and that was the 1963 Pontiac Tempest.

01:47:58.988 --> 01:48:03.534
And because both cars were made by GM,

01:48:03.659 --> 01:48:08.873
were both cars available
in metallic mint-green paint?

01:48:09.290 --> 01:48:12.293
- They were.
- Thank you, Miss Vito.

01:48:12.418 --> 01:48:15.922
No more questions.
Thank you very, very much.

01:48:16.047 --> 01:48:20.760
You've been a lovely, lovely witness.

01:48:32.939 --> 01:48:36.484
Mr Trotter, would you like
to question Miss Vito?

01:48:39.487 --> 01:48:41.656
Mr Trotter.

01:48:50.832 --> 01:48:53.751
No. No, Your Honour. No further questions.

01:48:53.876 --> 01:48:57.880
In that case, Your Honour,
I'd like to recall George Wilbur.

01:49:00.133 --> 01:49:02.802
Miss Vito, you can stand down.

01:49:10.893 --> 01:49:13.646
You realise you're still under oath.

01:49:13.771 --> 01:49:16.232
Yes, Your Honour.

01:49:16.357 --> 01:49:20.736
Mr Wilbur, how'd you like
Miss Vito's testimony?

01:49:21.571 --> 01:49:23.656
Very impressive.

01:49:23.781 --> 01:49:25.825
She's cute too, huh?

01:49:25.950 --> 01:49:28.536
Yes, very.

01:49:28.661 --> 01:49:32.290
- Mr Gambini.
- Sorry, Your Honour.

01:49:32.415 --> 01:49:35.501
Mr Wilbur, in your expert opinion,

01:49:35.877 --> 01:49:42.300
would you say that everything Miss Vito
said on the stand was 100% accurate?

01:49:44.427 --> 01:49:48.639
- I'd have to say that.
- And is there any way in the world

01:49:48.765 --> 01:49:53.019
the Buick that the defendants
were driving made those tyre tracks?

01:49:57.523 --> 01:50:00.276
Come on. You can say. It's OK, they know.

01:50:01.235 --> 01:50:03.321
Actually,

01:50:03.446 --> 01:50:05.448
- no.
- No.

01:50:05.573 --> 01:50:07.992
Thank you. No more questions.

01:50:11.287 --> 01:50:13.956
Your Honour, I call Sheriff Farley.

01:50:15.541 --> 01:50:18.294
You may stand down now, Mr Wilbur.

01:50:24.383 --> 01:50:28.137
- Sheriff, you realise you're still under oath?
- Yes, sir.

01:50:29.055 --> 01:50:31.099
Sheriff Farley.

01:50:33.434 --> 01:50:37.355
- What'd you find out?
- On a hunch,

01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:43.069
I took it upon myself to check if there was
any information on a '63 Pontiac Tempest

01:50:43.319 --> 01:50:45.446
stolen or abandoned recently.

01:50:46.489 --> 01:50:49.325
This computer read-out
confirms that two boys,

01:50:49.450 --> 01:50:53.121
who fit the defendants' description,
were arrested two days ago

01:50:53.246 --> 01:50:55.915
by Sheriff Tilman in Jasper County, Georgia,

01:50:56.040 --> 01:51:01.254
for driving a stolen metallic
mint-green 1963 Pontiac Tempest

01:51:01.796 --> 01:51:09.095
with a white convertible top,
Michelin model XGV tyres, size 75R-14.

01:51:11.264 --> 01:51:13.516
- Is that it?
- No.

01:51:15.351 --> 01:51:19.272
A.357 Magnum revolver
was found in their possession.

01:51:19.939 --> 01:51:23.401
Sheriff Farley, just to refresh
the court's memory,

01:51:23.526 --> 01:51:27.447
what calibre bullet
was used to murder Jimmy Willis?

01:51:27.905 --> 01:51:31.868
- A.357 Magnum.
- The defence rests.

01:51:38.166 --> 01:51:40.418
Mr Trotter.

01:51:49.385 --> 01:51:54.098
Your Honour, in light of Miss Vito's
and Mr Wilbur's testimony,

01:51:55.767 --> 01:51:58.269
the State'd like to dismiss all charges.

01:52:04.901 --> 01:52:07.111
Order in the court.

01:52:17.872 --> 01:52:19.874
Order here.

01:52:33.096 --> 01:52:36.933
I have to get out of here by three.
Make sure all the bags are in the car.

01:52:37.058 --> 01:52:42.063
Vinny, I'm sorry to have ever doubted you
at any time, and for this I apologise.

01:52:42.188 --> 01:52:47.819
Under the circumstances... You were
great. I just want to say thank you.

01:52:47.944 --> 01:52:50.071
You're welcome. I hope we can do it again.

01:52:50.196 --> 01:52:52.365
- Fine job, Mr Gambini.
- Thanks.

01:52:52.490 --> 01:52:55.785
- Y'all come back and see us any time now.
- I'll see.

01:52:55.910 --> 01:52:58.162
- Vin.
- Bill.

01:53:00.164 --> 01:53:02.208
- You're welcome.
- Vin, l....

01:53:04.043 --> 01:53:09.298
Listen. Take your time, pick the right words,
get back to New York, gimme a call.

01:53:13.386 --> 01:53:15.888
- Vinny, you did a terrific job.
- Thanks.

01:53:16.013 --> 01:53:18.724
You got an open invitation
any time you come here.

01:53:18.850 --> 01:53:21.519
- We can get us a deer next time.
- OK. Thanks a lot.

01:53:21.644 --> 01:53:25.773
I feel like if I don't get outta here
now, I might never be able to leave.

01:53:25.898 --> 01:53:28.276
Mr Gambini.

01:53:28.401 --> 01:53:31.404
I have a fax here from the clerk of New York.

01:53:34.699 --> 01:53:36.784
I owe you an apology, sir.

01:53:36.909 --> 01:53:39.620
I'm honoured to shake your hand.

01:53:39.745 --> 01:53:42.206
"Win some, lose some."

01:53:42.331 --> 01:53:46.919
Your courtroom manner may be rather
unconventional, but I gotta tell you,

01:53:47.044 --> 01:53:49.505
you're one helluva trial lawyer.

01:53:50.173 --> 01:53:52.967
Thank you. And you're one helluva judge.

01:53:53.092 --> 01:53:55.136
Sorry.

01:53:58.890 --> 01:54:00.475
Bye, now.

01:54:07.774 --> 01:54:10.735
What the hell was that all about back there?

01:54:11.611 --> 01:54:14.113
I had a friend send a fax to the judge,

01:54:14.238 --> 01:54:19.368
confirming the very impressive
legal stature of Jerry Callo.

01:54:20.495 --> 01:54:23.080
What friends you got in the clerk's office?

01:54:23.206 --> 01:54:26.250
- Your friend.
- My friend?

01:54:26.375 --> 01:54:28.419
Judge Malloy.

01:54:30.713 --> 01:54:32.882
So what's your problem?

01:54:33.007 --> 01:54:37.929
My problem is I wanted to win my first case
without any help from anybody.

01:54:38.054 --> 01:54:40.181
Well, I guess that plan's moot.

01:54:40.306 --> 01:54:42.350
Yeah.

01:54:43.101 --> 01:54:45.394
This could be a sign of things to come.

01:54:45.686 --> 01:54:49.440
You win all your cases,
but with somebody else's help, right?

01:54:49.690 --> 01:54:52.401
You win case after case,
and then afterwards,

01:54:52.527 --> 01:54:57.115
you have to go up to somebody
and you have to say "Thank you."

01:54:57.240 --> 01:55:00.493
Oh, my God. What a fuckin' nightmare.

01:55:07.083 --> 01:55:09.585
I won my first case.
You know what this means.

01:55:09.961 --> 01:55:14.757
- Yeah. You think I'm gonna marry you.
- You're not gonna marry me now?

01:55:14.882 --> 01:55:18.761
No way. You can't win a case by
yourself. You're fuckin' useless.

01:55:21.681 --> 01:55:24.016
I thought we'd get married this weekend.

01:55:24.142 --> 01:55:28.855
You don't get it, do you? That is not
romantic. I want a wedding in church

01:55:29.230 --> 01:55:31.149
with bridesmaids and flowers.

01:55:31.274 --> 01:55:35.278
How many times did you
say that spontaneous is romantic?

01:55:35.403 --> 01:55:39.198
Hey, a burp is spontaneous.
A burp is not romantic.
