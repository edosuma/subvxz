00:03.302 --> 00:04.701
<i>- Hello.
- Bobby Singer?</i>

00:04.870 --> 00:06.735
My surgeon is a monster.

00:06.906 --> 00:09.204
Please get your ass here
to Sioux Falls General.

00:10.843 --> 00:14.540
They're like Shapeshifters,
only a lot more into eating folk.

00:16.248 --> 00:17.374
And nothing can kill them.

00:19.485 --> 00:21.976
- Anything else?
- Yeah. They bleed black goo.

00:22.154 --> 00:23.712
Hi, Sam.

00:23.889 --> 00:25.481
Hi, Dean.

00:31.764 --> 00:33.823
That spell only lasts for a few days.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.366
Stuff you don't talk about
doesn't just go away.

00:36.535 --> 00:39.902
- What are you talking about?
- Whatever you're not telling me about.

00:43.242 --> 00:44.539
We're good, right?

00:44.710 --> 00:46.507
We're good.

00:55.388 --> 00:57.754
You sure about this?

00:59.058 --> 01:00.958
Trust me.

01:03.763 --> 01:07.062
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.

01:08.901 --> 01:11.301
Morning, "Megan."

01:11.470 --> 01:13.597
That is a really, really pretty dress.

01:14.473 --> 01:15.906
Thank you. It's vintage.

01:16.075 --> 01:17.440
Well, it looks new on you.

01:17.610 --> 01:19.805
- Well, aren't you sweet, sir.
- Call me Dean.

01:19.979 --> 01:21.708
How can I help you today, Dean?

01:21.881 --> 01:23.041
Um...

01:23.215 --> 01:25.479
I don't actually have an account
at this bank...

01:25.685 --> 01:29.985
...but I was wondering if there was
any way I could get change for that?

01:30.189 --> 01:32.783
I think I can make an exception.
Just for you.

01:32.958 --> 01:34.823
- Thanks.
- Ha, ha.

01:39.598 --> 01:41.225
How do you want it, Dean?

01:43.569 --> 01:46.129
I'm gonna have to take a rain check,
and all your money.

01:51.811 --> 01:54.075
Hands in the air! Hands in the air!

01:56.515 --> 01:58.415
Your money's insured...

01:58.584 --> 02:01.144
...so no heroes, okay?

02:03.489 --> 02:05.218
Get in there.

02:06.525 --> 02:09.425
It's okay. Stay calm.

02:09.595 --> 02:12.155
- You ready?
- Yup.

02:41.393 --> 02:46.228
Okay, Chet, let's see how you like
a little fruit of the poison tree.

02:46.398 --> 02:50.300
- Isn't that just a legal expression?
- You're gonna wish it was.

02:53.272 --> 02:54.500
Hm.

02:55.808 --> 02:56.900
Oak-y.

02:57.910 --> 03:01.869
Similar finish to holy water,
not as bitter as rock salt.

03:04.683 --> 03:08.210
And how are my two
favorite meatsicles?

03:08.387 --> 03:10.787
Is he still sucking air?

03:11.056 --> 03:15.516
Greatest hits didn't do the trick.
I'm down to B-sides and deep cuts.

03:15.895 --> 03:17.556
Better figure out something quick.

03:17.730 --> 03:20.722
That whammy that witch dude
put on him only lasts a few days.

03:20.900 --> 03:24.392
He gets his spinach back, we're gonna
end up having to drop a car on him.

03:24.570 --> 03:28.233
Actually,
Edgar walked away from that car.

03:28.407 --> 03:29.499
He's fine.

03:29.675 --> 03:32.166
Well, he's a little pissed at you, but...

03:34.880 --> 03:37.212
Oh, you didn't know?

03:37.383 --> 03:40.113
- You shut your cake trap.
- Ooh.

03:40.519 --> 03:44.250
Bobby, you've been using all this stuff
and he still won't talk?

03:50.596 --> 03:52.029
Huddle over, coach?

03:52.631 --> 03:53.825
How'd you find us?

03:55.401 --> 03:58.029
It was easy.
I used pattern-recognition software...

03:58.204 --> 04:00.900
...and a basic heuristic algorithm
to track your aliases.

04:02.341 --> 04:05.469
Great, just what we need,
a Mensa monster.

04:08.080 --> 04:13.040
All right, let's just start with the start.
Where'd you get our aliases?

04:13.219 --> 04:16.450
From your trench-coated friend,
obviously.

04:16.622 --> 04:18.988
When we were all nestled in
at Camp Cass...

04:19.391 --> 04:21.382
...kind of got the full download.

04:22.094 --> 04:23.152
That's just how we do.

04:23.462 --> 04:25.794
So why are you talking to us, Chet?

04:27.433 --> 04:30.334
You're not dumb.
Why are you spilling state secrets?

04:30.502 --> 04:32.129
Because I'm not scared of you.

04:32.938 --> 04:34.997
You can't stop me.

04:35.174 --> 04:37.904
You can't stop any of us.

04:38.444 --> 04:41.936
We can't be killed,
you stupid little chew toys.

04:42.514 --> 04:45.278
You are aware that I'm the least
of your concerns, right?

04:47.953 --> 04:49.443
Oh.

04:50.589 --> 04:52.887
You haven't watched the news today,
have you?

04:56.195 --> 04:58.959
<i>The two men who,
up until today, were presumed dead...</i>

04:59.131 --> 05:03.033
<i>...locked the doors and opened fire,
leaving no survivors.</i>

05:03.202 --> 05:06.103
<i>Sam and Dean Winchester
are now the subjects of a manhunt...</i>

05:06.272 --> 05:08.297
<i>...throughout the state of California.</i>

05:10.776 --> 05:14.769
- Busy morning, you two?
- The sons of bitches xeroxed us.

05:14.947 --> 05:17.677
- But I don't understand how.
- I don't know.

05:19.551 --> 05:22.452
Maybe one of them touched you
at the hospital.

05:22.621 --> 05:23.815
It was the hair!

05:24.924 --> 05:28.325
Not too hard to lift some DNA
out of a motel shower drain, guys.

05:31.030 --> 05:32.793
You can copy people like that?

05:33.299 --> 05:34.357
Awesome.

05:34.533 --> 05:37.331
- Well, what is their plan exactly?
- Squeeze us, heh.

05:37.503 --> 05:40.336
Turn us into the most wanted men
in America.

05:40.506 --> 05:43.703
That settles it. We find these
ass monkeys and kill them ourselves.

05:43.876 --> 05:46.504
Wait. Every form of law enforcement
in the country...

05:46.679 --> 05:48.544
...has seen your ugly mugs
this morning.

05:48.714 --> 05:52.480
- So what's the point trying to hide?
- Better than sticking your fool neck out.

05:52.651 --> 05:55.643
- These things are smarter than you.
- Gee, don't sugarcoat it.

05:55.821 --> 05:58.688
You don't have a clue how to kill them
or slow them down.

05:58.857 --> 06:01.155
And your plan is what,
go right at them?

06:01.327 --> 06:02.988
- Genius.
- They're wearing our faces.

06:03.162 --> 06:04.857
- This is personal.
- I'm with Dean.

06:08.334 --> 06:11.895
Well, if you're gonna be stupid,
you might as well be smart about it.

06:14.707 --> 06:17.073
You need to see a fellow
named Frank Devereaux.

06:17.242 --> 06:18.334
Who's he?

06:18.510 --> 06:21.206
He's ajackass and a lunatic...

06:21.380 --> 06:24.281
...but he owes me one,
from back in Port Huron.

06:26.485 --> 06:29.352
In the meantime,
I'll keep working on Chatty Cathy here...

06:29.521 --> 06:32.979
...see if I can figure out
what makes him die.

06:51.643 --> 06:52.905
The usual?

06:53.078 --> 06:55.546
Rhymes with "singsongs."

06:57.449 --> 06:59.610
You guys sell protein bars?

06:59.785 --> 07:01.252
Yeah.

07:05.724 --> 07:07.919
But it's in the back, though.

07:08.093 --> 07:09.890
Just, uh, give me a second.

07:10.062 --> 07:11.529
Sure. Thanks.

07:31.784 --> 07:35.049
Pretty sure the cashierjust made me.
Drive.

07:59.611 --> 08:01.670
Special Agent Morris,
Special Agent Valente.

08:01.847 --> 08:05.146
Gentlemen, these Winchester boys
are keeping busy, I hear.

08:05.317 --> 08:07.376
What is this,
some type of psycho road trip?

08:07.586 --> 08:10.146
The second bank,
plus that convenience store.

08:10.322 --> 08:13.621
A couple of days ago, they were dead.
We know about what you know.

08:14.026 --> 08:15.459
Excuse me.

08:15.994 --> 08:18.019
Actual serial killers, heh.

08:18.197 --> 08:21.564
Crime spree means paperwork.
Lots of it. Which you'll be doing.

08:24.103 --> 08:28.062
We gotta go.
Winchesters spotted at a Gas-N-Sip.

08:28.240 --> 08:31.038
It's about a thousand miles from here.
That's fast.

08:31.210 --> 08:34.543
- Must have flown.
- That or Batmobile.

08:52.364 --> 08:54.730
You sure this is the right place?

08:55.767 --> 08:57.496
Yeah.

09:07.746 --> 09:09.737
Frank, you in there?

09:10.249 --> 09:11.876
Frank?

09:15.521 --> 09:17.148
Frank?

09:22.928 --> 09:24.520
Frank?

09:27.065 --> 09:29.363
Frank, anybody here?

09:34.373 --> 09:36.398
Hello?

09:37.709 --> 09:39.939
Anybody home?

09:45.484 --> 09:46.917
Well, well.

09:47.920 --> 09:51.947
Spider caught some flies. Heh, heh.

10:04.436 --> 10:06.631
Well, I'll be darned.

10:06.805 --> 10:10.571
Psycho Butch and Sundance.

10:11.109 --> 10:14.010
- You're on CNN right now.
- No, no. That's not us.

10:14.413 --> 10:16.973
No. Can't be.
Unless you had a teleporter.

10:18.350 --> 10:20.750
Do you have a teleporter?

10:21.753 --> 10:23.721
No, sir. We don't.

10:25.591 --> 10:29.459
Well, my condolences
on the doppelgangers.

10:29.628 --> 10:32.620
Now, who sent you? NSA? The feeb?

10:33.131 --> 10:34.928
March of Dimes?

10:37.336 --> 10:38.860
Uh, Bobby Singer sent us.

10:40.639 --> 10:42.607
- Or not. Who?
- He said you could help.

10:42.774 --> 10:44.674
He said you owed him
from, uh, Port Huron.

10:49.448 --> 10:51.882
Guy saves your life one time...

10:52.050 --> 10:54.382
...and what,
you owe him the rest of yours?

10:54.686 --> 10:57.280
That's usually how it works, yeah.

11:11.536 --> 11:13.629
Oh, yeah.

11:14.006 --> 11:16.907
I know that Bobby's into
that magic hooey...

11:17.075 --> 11:20.533
...but truth is the government
have been cloning people for years.

11:20.712 --> 11:23.180
- Guess it was your turn in the barrel.
- Actually...

11:23.348 --> 11:26.715
- Forget it, he's rolling.
- Yours have been busy beavers.

11:26.885 --> 11:28.876
You're number two
on the Most Wanted list.

11:29.054 --> 11:31.488
Quickest climb up the charts
since Donna Summer.

11:32.491 --> 11:34.152
So, what do you think we should do?

11:34.326 --> 11:36.157
Cuba's nice this time of year.

11:36.328 --> 11:41.163
- No, we're not hiding.
- Heh, is he always this stupid?

11:41.333 --> 11:44.427
Look, we, uh, gotta stick around
and kick a couple of asses.

11:44.603 --> 11:47.697
So, uh, we just need you to get us
further off the grid...

11:47.873 --> 11:49.568
...but keep us on the board.

11:50.375 --> 11:54.334
Well, first thing we gotta do
is, uh, wipe all your old aliases.

11:54.513 --> 11:59.382
Uh, no more rock shout-outs.
It's Tom and John Smith from now on.

11:59.551 --> 12:02.179
And no plastic. Cash only.

12:02.354 --> 12:05.551
And change your phones on a very
frequent non-schedule schedule.

12:05.724 --> 12:08.090
You understand?
Oh, and try to stay out of view...

12:08.260 --> 12:12.788
...of the 200 million cameras that
the government has access to, okay?

12:12.964 --> 12:14.363
Two hundred million?

12:14.533 --> 12:16.728
Big Brother,
he has many eyeballs, my friend.

12:16.902 --> 12:19.598
You see a place that looks like
it can afford security...

12:19.771 --> 12:22.399
...you just ease on down the road.

12:22.574 --> 12:23.939
This, uh...

12:25.110 --> 12:26.737
This is your laptop, right?

12:27.279 --> 12:28.576
Yeah, that's mine.

12:28.747 --> 12:30.442
Whoa.

12:30.615 --> 12:32.640
Hey! What are you...?

12:32.851 --> 12:34.876
What was that?

12:37.756 --> 12:39.724
Uh...

12:43.395 --> 12:47.058
- Thank you, I guess.
- No problem. You owe me 5 grand, cash.

12:47.232 --> 12:48.460
- What?
- What?

12:48.633 --> 12:52.797
Unless you wanna go comparison shop
at the mall. Say hi to the cops for me.

12:53.739 --> 12:55.866
Okay.

12:57.008 --> 13:02.412
Let's Blue Steel you up some new ID,
Mr. And Mr. Smith.

13:04.950 --> 13:06.440
Whoo!

13:06.985 --> 13:09.010
Do it again. Come on, do it again.

13:10.822 --> 13:13.689
Just gonna touch me in the morning
then just walk away.

13:13.892 --> 13:15.291
- You're still talking.
- Ha, ha.

13:15.460 --> 13:17.121
Aren't you sick of this yet?

13:17.295 --> 13:20.856
You bleed black snot, sure...

13:21.032 --> 13:22.932
...but you bleed, you can die.

13:23.101 --> 13:25.695
Sure, sport, whatever you say.

13:26.671 --> 13:30.630
Try the acid again, why don't you?
Poor sap, you're stumped.

13:30.809 --> 13:32.208
Give it a rest, mouthy.

13:32.411 --> 13:35.039
How long you think these will hold once
the spell wears off, hmm?

13:35.514 --> 13:37.004
Ticktock, old man.

13:37.616 --> 13:40.779
I'm gonna really enjoy eating you.

13:40.952 --> 13:43.011
- Right down to that hat.
- I said shut up.

13:43.188 --> 13:46.783
And then I'm gonna eat everyone
you ever said hello to.

13:51.830 --> 13:53.730
Hot damn.

13:53.932 --> 13:55.490
Well, that's something.

13:57.369 --> 13:59.667
I marked all the towns
your stunt doubles hit...

13:59.838 --> 14:01.533
...so you can see the pattern.

14:01.706 --> 14:04.971
All right, great.
Um, so, what is the pattern?

14:05.143 --> 14:07.008
No clue, man. I can't see it.

14:07.179 --> 14:09.374
- Seems random.
- Little tip from a pro:

14:09.548 --> 14:13.985
There's no such thing as a random series
of robbery-murders by your evil twins.

14:14.486 --> 14:17.478
Well, have yourself some uppers
and look at that some more.

14:17.656 --> 14:19.817
- Good luck.
- Thanks, Frank.

14:19.991 --> 14:22.755
For what? Sending you to your death?

14:22.961 --> 14:24.826
<i>Your doubles wanna be
on Candid Camera.</i>

14:24.996 --> 14:26.486
Put you in the line of fire.

14:26.665 --> 14:29.862
Now, I'd lay low because I love life
and its infinite mysteries...

14:30.035 --> 14:32.162
...but you two wanna be dumb,
that's fine.

14:32.337 --> 14:35.397
At least have the common sense
to ditch your car.

14:35.874 --> 14:38.240
Wh...? Uh, excuse me, what?

14:38.410 --> 14:43.109
Your Doublemints, they're using a car
just like the one outside.

15:07.539 --> 15:09.200
What the?

15:16.448 --> 15:18.473
What the hell are you doing here?

15:18.650 --> 15:20.447
You're all charm, Bobby.

15:20.619 --> 15:22.746
So my therapist keeps telling me.

15:22.921 --> 15:24.081
How'd you find me?

15:24.256 --> 15:26.918
I'm a cop, remember?

15:27.092 --> 15:28.218
You gonna invite me in?

15:28.393 --> 15:31.794
Well, you may not want me to.
I got one of the big mouths downstairs.

15:32.397 --> 15:34.422
So I won't go downstairs.

15:36.468 --> 15:37.765
Hmm?

15:37.936 --> 15:39.927
I, uh...

15:41.740 --> 15:43.264
I wanted to come thank you.

15:43.441 --> 15:46.501
- Thank me?
- Yeah. Seeing as they were fresh out of:

15:46.678 --> 15:50.136
"Thanks for saving me from
liver-eating surgeon" cards at the store.

15:50.315 --> 15:53.284
Oh, that. Just doing my job.

15:53.451 --> 15:55.442
Which nobody pays me for.

15:56.187 --> 15:57.677
Right.

15:57.923 --> 15:59.083
How you doing, Bobby?

15:59.558 --> 16:02.686
I'm fine. Every day's a gift.

16:02.861 --> 16:04.624
Your house just burned down.

16:04.796 --> 16:07.162
As you can see, I got a roof over me.

16:07.332 --> 16:11.166
Bobby, let someone be nice to you
for five minutes.

16:13.672 --> 16:15.503
Okay.

16:16.074 --> 16:18.770
But not too nice. I can't be going soft.

16:19.945 --> 16:21.435
Of course not.

16:22.113 --> 16:23.808
I can cook.

16:23.982 --> 16:26.382
Ish. Why don't you let me
make you something?

16:26.585 --> 16:31.022
Maybe put this new place of yours
in some kind of order.

16:31.189 --> 16:34.681
Come on, I owe you that much.

16:35.827 --> 16:38.022
Okay. Thanks, sheriff.

16:40.165 --> 16:41.962
Jody.

17:03.822 --> 17:05.847
Did you think it would be that easy?

17:06.223 --> 17:07.851
No.

17:08.727 --> 17:09.853
But it's a start.

17:11.730 --> 17:12.753
Yeah.

17:34.252 --> 17:36.083
You okay?

17:36.721 --> 17:41.021
It's bad enough they're ganking people
wearing our mugs, but now this?

17:41.192 --> 17:45.128
Have us driving around in this caboodle
while Baby's on lockdown.

17:45.296 --> 17:46.661
It's temporary, Dean.

17:47.365 --> 17:49.390
Nobody puts Baby in a corner.

17:50.235 --> 17:51.725
You know that's a line from...?

17:51.903 --> 17:54.394
A Swayze movie.
Swayze always gets a pass.

17:54.572 --> 17:57.564
Right. Well, you want some tunes
or something?

17:58.877 --> 17:59.901
Here.

18:02.313 --> 18:04.144
<i>What would you say
If I called on you now</i>

18:04.315 --> 18:06.374
<i>And said that I can't hold on?</i>

18:06.818 --> 18:08.547
- Sorry, man, l...
- Just leave it.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.551
It's probably gonna be
the only thing on.

18:10.722 --> 18:13.054
<i>It gets harder each day</i>

18:13.224 --> 18:16.455
<i>Please love me or I'll be gone</i>

18:17.262 --> 18:19.253
<i>I'll be gone</i>

18:20.999 --> 18:23.559
<i>I'm all out of love
I'm so lost without you</i>

18:23.735 --> 18:28.263
<i>I know you were right
Believing for so long</i>

18:28.440 --> 18:32.570
<i>I'm all out of love
What am I without you?</i>

18:32.744 --> 18:39.616
<i>I can't be too late
To say that I was so wrong</i>

18:41.853 --> 18:48.122
<i>Oh, what are you thinking of?</i>

18:48.293 --> 18:49.487
Here.

19:00.238 --> 19:01.796
- Dean.
- What?

19:01.973 --> 19:04.339
Jericho. The lady in white.

19:10.348 --> 19:12.839
Blackwater, Wendigo.

19:13.384 --> 19:15.284
Lake Manitoc, the kid in the lake.

19:19.023 --> 19:21.321
They're hitting towns
we've worked jobs in.

19:21.493 --> 19:24.155
In order.
Since the day I left Stanford with you.

19:25.363 --> 19:26.955
So they want us to find them?

19:28.199 --> 19:31.794
Well, one way to find out.
Next case would be in St. Louis.

19:33.271 --> 19:36.468
Perfect. Connor's Diner.
The best burgers in St. Louis.

19:36.641 --> 19:39.667
Oh, I deserve something good
in my life right now.

19:48.386 --> 19:51.878
You know he has one of these
every day?

19:52.056 --> 19:54.024
And in his heart...

19:54.192 --> 19:56.752
...he thinks
they're almost as good as sex.

19:56.928 --> 19:58.555
This...

19:58.897 --> 20:01.866
...is disgusting.
Heh.

20:03.802 --> 20:08.705
Dead plants with creamy goo.
It's like eating self-righteousness.

20:08.873 --> 20:12.434
- You tell me which is worse.
- You know what? I can't stand the guy.

20:12.610 --> 20:14.908
- Heh.
- Talk about a hero complex.

20:15.079 --> 20:18.515
He doesn't have relationships, no.
He has applications for sainthood.

20:18.683 --> 20:22.244
Oh, and he thinks he's funny.
Thinks he's a damn comedian.

20:22.687 --> 20:25.520
Who has two thumbs
and a full-blown bats in the belfry?

20:26.357 --> 20:29.053
I'm serious. It's nothing
but Satan vision on the inside.

20:29.227 --> 20:34.255
How he's walking around in ajacket
with detachable arms is beyond me.

20:35.567 --> 20:37.865
- I had a brother with this many issues.
- Yeah?

20:38.036 --> 20:39.128
- Know what I did?
- Hmm?

20:39.337 --> 20:40.565
- I ate him.
- Of course you did.

20:40.738 --> 20:42.205
How are these guys even a threat?

20:42.373 --> 20:45.809
- Boss says they gotta go, they gotta go.
- Right.

20:45.977 --> 20:48.445
Idea. Wanna trade?

20:48.613 --> 20:50.740
I mean, I'll take chuckles over schizo.

20:52.750 --> 20:56.447
No, I like this one's hair better.
You can stay in the big one.

20:56.955 --> 20:59.583
All right.
In that case, let's turn up the heat.

20:59.757 --> 21:03.591
The sooner I get out of this and
into something more stable, the better.

21:03.761 --> 21:05.058
Hold on.

21:05.263 --> 21:08.596
Hey, kid. Hey, why don't you fire up
the camera on that thing?

21:10.935 --> 21:12.402
Point it over here.

21:16.174 --> 21:17.835
Shall we?

21:18.009 --> 21:20.239
Everybody be cool, this is a robbery!

21:20.411 --> 21:24.108
Anybody moves
and I will execute every last one of you!

21:37.128 --> 21:39.358
<i>Chopping heads won't kill them...</i>

21:39.530 --> 21:41.191
<i>...but it'll slow them down pretty good.</i>

21:41.399 --> 21:43.458
<i>Till they fuse back up, anyhow.</i>

21:43.635 --> 21:47.002
Well, that's something, I guess.
Assuming we can get close to them.

21:47.171 --> 21:49.935
Yeah. I don't want you
walking right up to them either.

21:50.108 --> 21:52.372
I'm still looking for something
you can shoot.

21:52.543 --> 21:54.670
Good times. All right, thanks, Bobby.

21:54.846 --> 21:56.905
You take mayo, right, Bobby?

21:57.348 --> 21:59.009
You got a chick over there?

21:59.183 --> 22:01.014
What? No.

22:01.920 --> 22:05.219
- Are you even working, Richard Gere?
- Shut up, you idjit.

22:06.190 --> 22:08.021
- Heh.
- Where you boys off to next?

22:08.192 --> 22:12.060
- Uh, St. Louis. That's where we...
- It's too late. They hit St. Louis.

22:12.230 --> 22:14.130
Pumpkin and Honey Bunny'd
a diner there.

22:14.966 --> 22:17.526
<i>- Connor's Diner?
- Yeah. How'd you know?</i>

22:19.437 --> 22:20.495
Lucky guess.

22:20.672 --> 22:25.075
All right, so much for that.
I guess we're off to, uh, Ankeny, Iowa.

22:25.810 --> 22:28.574
<i>- Call us if you get anything else.
- You got it.</i>

22:32.517 --> 22:35.315
- There you go.
- You got it?

22:40.591 --> 22:42.252
- Put the covers there.
- Yeah.

22:42.460 --> 22:44.860
Special Agents Morris, Valente.

22:46.397 --> 22:47.728
You were first on the scene?

22:47.899 --> 22:50.732
- Unfortunately.
- Wanna tell us what happened?

22:57.275 --> 22:58.401
<i>- No!
- Help!</i>

22:58.576 --> 23:00.043
<i>- No.
- Stop!</i>

23:04.582 --> 23:07.107
<i>Hey, hey, hey! Keep that up!</i>

23:07.285 --> 23:10.721
<i>I didn't say you could put that down!
I want the whole world to know...</i>

23:10.888 --> 23:14.415
<i>...what Sam and Dean Winchester
are capable of.</i>

23:14.926 --> 23:17.417
<i>- No. No.
- Please.</i>

23:18.997 --> 23:20.760
<i>That all of them?</i>

23:22.133 --> 23:24.931
<i>- All but one.
- No. Please, no!</i>

23:32.543 --> 23:35.137
<i>Well, goodnight, St. Louis.</i>

23:35.313 --> 23:37.577
<i>You've been a wonderful crowd.</i>

23:38.116 --> 23:42.553
<i>Grab your socks and hose, lowa,
because we're headed to you next.</i>

23:43.888 --> 23:47.449
- We need to alert...
- Federal, state, local. I'm on it.

23:54.232 --> 23:55.790
Ooh.

24:06.110 --> 24:09.170
Does this skin make me look fat?

24:11.916 --> 24:13.178
Balls.

24:13.651 --> 24:16.586
It's pretty dark in here.

24:17.121 --> 24:18.816
High school dropout.

24:19.791 --> 24:22.259
A drunk like your daddy before you.

24:22.827 --> 24:27.992
Oh, you and dad,
now, that's a can of scorpions.

24:28.933 --> 24:33.302
Your favorite singer
is Joni fricking Mitchell?

24:33.604 --> 24:34.764
Oh, Bobby.

24:35.173 --> 24:39.337
You are 10 pounds of sad
in a 5-pound bag.

24:51.456 --> 24:52.821
Sam, Sam. Hold on.

24:55.526 --> 24:57.118
Don't move, don't move.

25:01.399 --> 25:03.390
Oh, no. This is all sorts of wrong.

25:05.603 --> 25:06.900
Oh, those are nice wheels.

25:07.105 --> 25:09.869
Tell you what, when this is over,
I'm stealing those rims.

25:11.242 --> 25:13.676
Tell the kids I said hi.

25:13.845 --> 25:15.904
- Yeah?
- Bobby, we got eyes on them.

25:16.114 --> 25:18.844
<i>- What?
- It's like looking at a fun-house mirror.</i>

25:19.016 --> 25:20.415
Yeah, I know the feeling.

25:20.618 --> 25:23.587
Tell me you got something,
otherwise we have to get in close.

25:23.754 --> 25:26.848
<i>- Look, just hang back for now.
- It's too late, we gotta...</i>

25:27.024 --> 25:28.218
Hang on.

25:29.627 --> 25:32.152
- Hands in the air!
- Whoa, whoa, big misunderstanding.

25:32.830 --> 25:34.730
- Look, the guys you want...
- Shut up.

25:34.899 --> 25:36.230
- Turn around. Look.
- Shut up.

25:36.400 --> 25:38.595
Drop the phone,
put your hands in the air.

25:38.769 --> 25:41.499
Dean? Dean?

25:41.672 --> 25:42.866
Cuff them.

25:49.547 --> 25:51.378
The thing about you, Bobby...

25:51.549 --> 25:54.575
Save it.
I already know me, handsome.

25:54.752 --> 25:57.448
You got the gruff thing down.

25:58.289 --> 26:01.452
Seen more death
than an electric chair.

26:01.659 --> 26:04.628
Ready to die with your boots on.

26:06.030 --> 26:09.727
But, you know,
deep down inside you're no cynic.

26:09.934 --> 26:12.198
You still hope.

26:12.370 --> 26:14.565
You even got a thing
for that lady upstairs.

26:15.206 --> 26:18.073
A tiny part of you thinks...

26:18.242 --> 26:21.370
...maybe, after this is all done...

26:21.546 --> 26:25.607
...you and Miss Sheriff can make
your own little cabin in the woods.

26:29.554 --> 26:31.454
That's hilarious.

26:31.622 --> 26:34.250
You're not getting any older
than tomorrow, Bobby.

26:35.593 --> 26:36.890
Why do you bother?

26:38.829 --> 26:40.558
You're a Browning fan?

26:40.932 --> 26:43.298
- Come again?
- Robert Browning.

26:44.001 --> 26:45.468
Poet.

26:45.803 --> 26:47.771
Got that name rattling around
up there...

26:47.939 --> 26:50.100
...with the rest of my thoughts
and feelings?

26:50.274 --> 26:54.074
It's kind of hard to sift through
all the drunken blackouts, but...

26:54.245 --> 26:57.112
A man's reach
should exceed his grasp.

26:58.449 --> 27:00.178
I like that.

27:00.351 --> 27:02.148
That's actually lovely.

27:02.320 --> 27:03.412
Browning, huh?

27:03.588 --> 27:06.216
After I eat you,
I'm definitely gonna hit the library.

27:08.826 --> 27:10.851
What the hell is that?

27:13.297 --> 27:15.197
Get it off. Get it off!

27:15.366 --> 27:17.834
Get it off! Get it off of me!

27:21.539 --> 27:22.597
Get it off me!

27:25.476 --> 27:27.501
Oh, sorry, little snafu here.

27:28.512 --> 27:30.036
Mm.

27:31.015 --> 27:32.983
Okay, wasn't expecting that reaction.

27:33.451 --> 27:35.043
What the hell was in that bucket?

27:38.522 --> 27:41.616
You're making a mistake,
the real killers are back at the diner.

27:41.792 --> 27:44.124
- That the best you can do?
- I want my phone call.

27:44.295 --> 27:46.729
Oh, there'll be a call, to the FBI.

27:46.897 --> 27:50.731
Take him to cell number one.
Take that one to the interview room.

27:50.901 --> 27:53.734
Once they're separate and secure,
you boys call it a night.

27:53.904 --> 27:55.303
You're making a mistake!

28:16.160 --> 28:18.526
What, did you guys forget something
or what?

28:29.173 --> 28:31.539
- Hey. I have a right to my phone call.
- A right?

28:31.709 --> 28:33.870
You killed
how many people last couple days...

28:34.045 --> 28:36.206
...and you want me to hop to
on your rights?

28:36.847 --> 28:38.712
Look, I didn't...

28:39.050 --> 28:40.574
Please...

28:40.751 --> 28:44.949
...just give me one phone call.

28:48.426 --> 28:49.518
Boys?

28:49.694 --> 28:51.719
- We got popped.
- I'll be there as soon as...

28:51.896 --> 28:55.457
No, no. There's no time.
Look, we saw them, they saw us.

28:55.633 --> 28:58.966
So we are coming to get us,
you read me?

28:59.136 --> 29:00.228
Tell me you got something.

29:00.404 --> 29:03.305
There's a chemical. Sodium borate.

29:03.474 --> 29:05.203
<i>Let me get Mr. Wizard on speed dial.</i>

29:05.376 --> 29:07.071
It ain't as weird as it sounds.

29:07.244 --> 29:10.873
It's found in industrial cleaners
and soaps and laundry powder.

29:11.048 --> 29:13.107
Anything with the word "borax" on it.

29:13.551 --> 29:15.917
You want me to desperate housewife
these mothers?

29:16.087 --> 29:19.215
Just trust me. It burns them bad enough
to slow them down.

29:19.390 --> 29:21.449
So get the strongest you can find.
Hear me?

29:21.625 --> 29:23.559
Borax burns. Got it.

29:23.728 --> 29:28.995
Then douse them, then you get close,
and then chop the heads off.

29:29.166 --> 29:31.259
<i>- Got it.
- And keep the heads separate.</i>

29:31.435 --> 29:33.494
Bobby, you're a genius. Thanks. L...

29:34.238 --> 29:37.173
- What'd you do that for?
- Borax? Decapitation?

29:37.375 --> 29:40.469
What kind of sickos are you
and your friends?

29:40.644 --> 29:43.772
Hey, you listen to me.
If you don't go get every ounce...

29:43.948 --> 29:48.351
...every drop of whatever that stuff is,
in this place right now...

29:48.519 --> 29:49.816
...we're all gonna die.

29:49.987 --> 29:53.423
Whoa, you're crazier than I thought.

29:54.258 --> 29:55.919
Hey!

30:03.634 --> 30:05.397
What are you doing?

30:05.703 --> 30:08.331
What is your problem?
We don't have time for lunch.

30:08.506 --> 30:11.339
- I was hungry.
- Later. Let's go.

30:28.292 --> 30:30.692
What is it? What happened?

30:30.861 --> 30:34.024
I, uh... It's just...

30:34.198 --> 30:37.167
- I don't know what I just saw.
- Let me out of here.

30:39.537 --> 30:42.301
Okay, listen to me and we'll live.
Keep your head down.

30:42.473 --> 30:45.374
Get to the supply closet,
get anything that says "borax" on it.

30:45.543 --> 30:47.841
Bring it here. Now. Go.

30:57.721 --> 30:59.086
Dean.

31:01.959 --> 31:03.051
I'm not your brother.

31:05.329 --> 31:09.197
But I am Dean adjacent. Heh, heh.

31:17.107 --> 31:19.200
Sorry.

31:20.411 --> 31:22.003
Sammy.

31:23.214 --> 31:24.841
Not Sammy.

31:35.893 --> 31:38.953
I just wanna let you know how much
I've really grown to hate...

31:39.129 --> 31:42.292
...you and your brother
since we've been wearing you.

31:43.100 --> 31:45.125
I just don't get it.

31:45.903 --> 31:49.236
You could be anything.
You're strong, you're uninhibited.

31:49.406 --> 31:51.704
You're smart enough, believe it or not.

31:51.876 --> 31:56.609
But you're so caught up in being good
and taking care of each other.

31:56.780 --> 31:59.305
- What do you care?
- Because it pisses me off!

32:04.321 --> 32:08.087
You're wasting a perfectly good
opportunity to subjugate the weak.

32:16.800 --> 32:19.633
Cute. Really think you can get
close enough to use it?

32:19.803 --> 32:21.430
Not until you're burning.

32:32.349 --> 32:35.443
Here's the deal. Dean...

32:36.987 --> 32:39.649
...thinks you're nutballs.
Thinks you're off your game.

32:39.823 --> 32:43.759
You gonna kill me or is this some
sort of play-with-your-food bull?

32:44.428 --> 32:45.486
All right.

32:46.797 --> 32:48.662
All right.

32:50.434 --> 32:54.996
Heh, you know, I guess that's why
Dean never told you that he killed Amy.

32:58.809 --> 32:59.867
There it is.

33:00.878 --> 33:06.214
The look on your face. That is priceless.
That's what I've been waiting for.

33:08.319 --> 33:10.480
Now I can eat you.

33:12.957 --> 33:14.356
Because you see...

33:15.893 --> 33:18.088
...I like my meat a little bitter.

33:31.408 --> 33:32.841
Wow, that felt good.

33:33.644 --> 33:34.838
Here.

33:36.146 --> 33:39.081
So the FBI is on the way.

33:39.249 --> 33:42.218
- Yeah, listen, about that, uh...
- Whatever I can do.

33:42.386 --> 33:46.152
Especially if it involves lying
about everything I just saw.

33:46.323 --> 33:52.387
Good. I was hoping you could help us
kind of be "dead."

33:52.563 --> 33:54.224
You know, quote-unquote.

33:54.398 --> 33:58.164
Yeah.
Yeah, I should be able to swing that.

33:58.702 --> 34:01.262
All right. Come on, let's grab a mop.

34:03.907 --> 34:06.000
Sammy? You okay?

34:09.146 --> 34:11.011
Yeah, I'm fine.

34:11.681 --> 34:13.411
Let's go.

34:15.853 --> 34:19.516
That's when I got the drop on them
and shot them both.

34:19.690 --> 34:22.056
- You did good, sheriff.
- Here's the files.

34:22.226 --> 34:24.091
Cause of death:
Multiple gunshot wounds.

34:24.261 --> 34:28.357
- I fingerprinted them for your records.
- Mind if we take a look at the bodies?

34:28.532 --> 34:31.364
Their bodies were sent
to the funeral home for cremation.

34:31.534 --> 34:34.561
As per their living wills
and religious requirements.

34:34.737 --> 34:38.639
Wow, that must be some kind of record.
They died last night.

34:38.809 --> 34:42.040
You can contact the funeral home,
they might still have the bodies.

34:42.212 --> 34:45.579
As you know, once we do the autopsy,
we're obliged to release...

34:45.748 --> 34:48.081
You had the bodies destroyed?

34:48.252 --> 34:52.416
- What kind of backwater operation is this?
- Hey, easy. Forget about it.

34:52.956 --> 34:55.150
No bodies, no paperwork, right?

34:55.324 --> 34:57.816
Someone once told me
that was a good thing.

34:57.995 --> 35:01.396
The good news still stands.
This case is closed.

35:01.565 --> 35:03.226
Sam and Dean Winchester are dead.

35:10.274 --> 35:13.766
<i>The Winchester crime spree
has come to a violent end in lowa...</i>

35:13.944 --> 35:16.276
<i>...where they were gunned down.</i>

35:16.447 --> 35:19.109
That should take the heat off, for now.

35:19.583 --> 35:22.746
Thanks, Jody.
Couldn't have done it without you.

35:22.920 --> 35:25.650
Anytime you need me to spill something,
give me a call.

35:26.023 --> 35:28.856
Actually, there is one more thing.

35:44.975 --> 35:48.308
Don't open it, even if it starts talking.

35:48.479 --> 35:50.310
Especially if it starts talking.

35:50.481 --> 35:54.110
When you cross over Underhill Bridge,
just toss it in the drink.

35:54.551 --> 35:58.612
If you excuse me,
I, uh, got a body to bury in cement.

36:15.706 --> 36:18.004
Dad, seriously?

36:18.175 --> 36:21.201
Lying to the FBI, incinerating bodies,
and this stuff?

36:21.378 --> 36:24.211
What the hell is it?
Because it sure isn't blood.

36:24.381 --> 36:26.474
You're right about that, sweetie.

36:26.650 --> 36:27.981
It's much more than blood.

36:28.152 --> 36:30.313
- I can explain.
- Don't bother.

36:56.246 --> 36:58.237
It's Valente.

36:58.816 --> 37:00.613
Yes, sir. I'm with them now.

37:01.351 --> 37:06.846
Well, unfortunately
their heads are missing.

37:07.224 --> 37:08.384
Huh?

37:08.559 --> 37:11.289
But the actual Winchesters are dead,
yes?

37:11.461 --> 37:13.326
No, sir. They're in the wind.

37:13.730 --> 37:17.723
So all that brainpower, those resources,
and those two are still on my to-do list?

37:17.901 --> 37:21.632
I'm sorry, sir. We could grab some
more DNA and double them again.

37:21.839 --> 37:24.899
I like where your head's at,
but sometimes less is more.

37:25.409 --> 37:29.038
Those boys coming back from the dead
again starts to strain credulity.

37:29.213 --> 37:32.478
<i>- Even for the American media, right?
- Yes, sir.</i>

37:32.983 --> 37:35.213
I like a subtler approach.

37:35.385 --> 37:37.148
Back to the vision board on this one.

37:37.354 --> 37:38.480
Of course.

37:38.655 --> 37:40.646
Secure the bodies
and get back to the FBI.

37:40.858 --> 37:43.326
We'll give this Winchester situation
a good think.

37:43.493 --> 37:45.984
Definitely. Thanks, sir.

37:46.163 --> 37:50.327
And, Valente, next time
call me with a win, for your sake.

37:50.500 --> 37:51.933
Please don't make me bib you.

37:53.503 --> 37:54.800
Yes, sir.

37:56.673 --> 37:59.836
I'm craving a latte.
Mind running across the street?

38:00.010 --> 38:02.808
Decaf, two pumps vanilla.
Grab yourself whatever you want.

38:02.980 --> 38:04.811
Thank you, sir.

38:14.925 --> 38:18.326
Mr. Roman.
I thought it was time we met in person.

38:19.596 --> 38:21.928
I'm Crowley. I run hell.

38:22.099 --> 38:26.627
Yes. Yes, of course.
I agree 100 percent, high time we met.

38:27.404 --> 38:30.771
- A token.
- You shouldn't have. I love a muffin.

38:31.408 --> 38:35.367
One hundred percent
organic baby uvulas. Gluten-free.

38:35.545 --> 38:36.842
So considerate.

38:40.350 --> 38:44.411
- I'll cut to the chase, Mr. Roman.
- Please. Dick.

38:44.922 --> 38:45.980
Dick.

38:46.156 --> 38:48.954
You and I control large interests...

38:49.126 --> 38:52.960
...that I feel strongly could meld
to the benefit of all.

38:53.130 --> 38:55.030
- You think?
- I know.

38:55.198 --> 38:58.531
Straight talk.
We should be friends, you and I.

38:58.835 --> 39:02.032
Why? Why in the world would we be?

39:02.873 --> 39:08.402
Well, I brought you here, Dick. I found
the way to open the door to purgatory.

39:08.578 --> 39:12.537
To steal every last soul, you mean.
You and that angel friend of yours.

39:12.716 --> 39:14.707
Don't roofie me and call it romance.

39:14.885 --> 39:16.876
I think you've got me wrong.

39:17.054 --> 39:18.646
Now it's your turn to listen.

39:20.057 --> 39:21.888
I'd sooner swim through hot garbage...

39:22.059 --> 39:24.960
...than shake hands with
a bottom-feeding mutation like you.

39:26.196 --> 39:30.656
You demons are ugly, lazy,
gold-digging whores.

39:31.268 --> 39:32.667
You're less than humans.

39:33.370 --> 39:37.204
And they're not good for much
till you dip them in garlic sauce.

39:37.874 --> 39:39.501
I'd never work with you, Crowley.

39:40.110 --> 39:43.102
If I wasn't busy with better things,
I might wipe your kind...

39:43.280 --> 39:46.113
...from the face of the universe.
And you'd deserve it.

39:48.051 --> 39:49.575
Are we clear?

39:54.424 --> 39:55.982
Keep the muffins.

40:06.203 --> 40:07.932
You sure you wanna
dump these things?

40:08.105 --> 40:11.541
I'm thinking they might come in handy
down the road. What do you think?

40:13.276 --> 40:14.903
Hey.

40:16.380 --> 40:17.870
What? What is it? Talk.

40:19.383 --> 40:22.284
- Nothing.
- Well, that's convincing.

40:22.452 --> 40:24.716
Look, did Monster R Us
give you the jeebs?

40:24.888 --> 40:28.221
I gotta be honest, I ain't looking
in the mirror for a while myself.

40:28.959 --> 40:30.722
Okay.

40:32.329 --> 40:34.092
You really wanna know what's wrong?

40:34.564 --> 40:37.795
Yeah. Yeah, you know my motto:
Here to help.

40:38.835 --> 40:40.598
Here to help.

40:41.571 --> 40:43.835
Kind of like you helped Amy?

40:48.745 --> 40:50.906
- Listen, Sam...
- Don't...

40:51.081 --> 40:52.139
Don't lie to me again.

40:52.649 --> 40:54.844
You know what,
don't even talk to me.

40:58.688 --> 41:00.349
Yeah, I can't. Ahem.

41:01.124 --> 41:04.025
You know what, Dean? I can't.

41:04.194 --> 41:07.595
- You can't what?
- I can't talk to you right now.

41:07.764 --> 41:10.597
Dean, I can't even be around you
right now.

41:10.767 --> 41:11.825
Okay, so?

41:12.002 --> 41:15.494
So I think you should just go on
without me.

41:21.611 --> 41:22.942
Go.

41:25.082 --> 41:26.777
All right.

41:27.150 --> 41:29.015
Sorry, Sam.
