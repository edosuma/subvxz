00:01.805 --> 00:03.435
Tribeca, I'd like you to
meet your new partner.

00:03.461 --> 00:04.763
This is Jay Geils.

00:04.796 --> 00:06.075
There's something you
should know about me.

00:06.101 --> 00:07.335
I don't like partners,

00:07.367 --> 00:09.272
and I especially don't like partners

00:09.298 --> 00:10.566
who try to get personal.

00:10.592 --> 00:11.604
I got to go take a poop.

00:11.605 --> 00:12.906
I was engaged to my first partner,

00:12.939 --> 00:15.909
and he vanished under
mysterious circumstances.

00:15.941 --> 00:18.244
I've had 236 partners,

00:18.278 --> 00:20.747
and I've fallen in love with
every single one of them.

00:20.781 --> 00:22.516
Nothing's gonna happen to me, kid.

00:22.549 --> 00:24.351
Tribeca, what the hell are you doing?!

00:24.383 --> 00:26.586
Geils?

00:26.619 --> 00:27.887
I do, too.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.074

00:37.129 --> 00:39.766
I never had to do that before.

00:39.799 --> 00:42.269
Did you see me? My hands were shaking.

00:42.302 --> 00:44.271
- I was sweating, too.
- Shh. It's okay.

00:44.303 --> 00:47.607
It's over.

00:52.211 --> 00:54.247
You've never opened up
to anyone in your life,

00:54.281 --> 00:57.784
and now you're finally taking
a chance on someone.

00:57.817 --> 01:00.588
How do you feel about that?

01:02.455 --> 01:05.825
I feel like this.

01:10.730 --> 01:13.667
I need to use the little
detective's room.

01:22.007 --> 01:23.242
What?

01:23.275 --> 01:24.477
I've just always wondered

01:24.510 --> 01:26.613
what you'd look like
wearing my bomb vest.

01:45.698 --> 01:48.101
Tribeca.

01:56.676 --> 02:00.013
Boop. Boop.

02:00.045 --> 02:02.782
Boop. Boop.

02:02.816 --> 02:05.352
Boop. Boop.

02:05.385 --> 02:07.688
Boop. Boop.

02:07.721 --> 02:09.788
Boop.

02:09.823 --> 02:10.858
Hi, there.

02:10.889 --> 02:13.025
Sergeant Pepper?

02:13.058 --> 02:15.095
- Eddie?
- Hi, Angie.

02:15.127 --> 02:17.830
- I thought you were...
- Shh.

02:17.864 --> 02:20.700
I want you to come with
me to the other side.

02:20.734 --> 02:22.169
I...

02:22.202 --> 02:23.503
Boop, boop.

02:23.537 --> 02:25.372
I...

02:25.405 --> 02:27.373
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop,
boop, boop, boop, boop, boop!

02:27.407 --> 02:28.808
Nurse!

02:31.010 --> 02:34.548
Geils! McCormick! Get the hell in here!

02:39.985 --> 02:43.723
McCormick, in 23 years
of law enforcement,

02:43.757 --> 02:45.526
you're the best officer
I've ever worked with...

02:45.558 --> 02:48.495
judgment, initiative,
investigative skills.

02:48.527 --> 02:51.230
That being said, you're being
transferred back to vice.

02:51.264 --> 02:53.701
See you around.

02:55.268 --> 02:57.971
What's up, Lieutenant?
Looks like you saw a ghost.

02:58.003 --> 03:00.072
Yes. But I have other news.

03:00.105 --> 03:02.075
You might want to sit down.

03:05.829 --> 03:07.246
She's awake.

03:13.119 --> 03:15.055
Angie?

03:15.087 --> 03:18.057
She was awake for a minute,
but now she's back out again.

03:19.391 --> 03:20.494
I can't take this.

03:23.629 --> 03:25.531
- Angie.
- Geils.

03:25.564 --> 03:28.168
- Hello, old friend.
- Hello!

03:28.200 --> 03:30.736
Angie. How you doing, girl?

03:30.770 --> 03:32.673
Tanner.

03:32.705 --> 03:35.274
Doctor said it'd be touch
and go for a while.

03:35.307 --> 03:37.109
Damn it, I hate to see her like this.

03:39.079 --> 03:40.414
Angie, how are you feeling?

03:40.447 --> 03:42.616
I-I guess I'm okay.

03:42.649 --> 03:43.950
How long have I been out?

03:43.984 --> 03:45.052
About nine months.

03:45.085 --> 03:47.254
Did someone leave a baby in the hallway?

03:47.287 --> 03:48.889
Oh, yeah, sorry. That's me.

03:50.590 --> 03:51.758
Is it mine?

03:51.790 --> 03:53.060
It's ours.

03:55.495 --> 03:56.964
I need a minute to process this.

03:56.996 --> 03:59.565
Why don't I take little
Angie down to the cafeteria

03:59.598 --> 04:00.800
and let you guys talk?

04:00.834 --> 04:03.135
You named her Angie? After me?

04:03.169 --> 04:06.006
Him. I named him after you.

04:06.740 --> 04:08.375
Look, you take it easy girl, all right?

04:08.407 --> 04:09.643
Hey, where's Hoffman?

04:09.675 --> 04:11.244
He got into the evidence locker room

04:11.276 --> 04:12.578
and ate some drug money.

04:12.611 --> 04:14.647
He'll be suspended
until he poops it out.

04:14.681 --> 04:15.816
In order to win the grand prize,

04:15.848 --> 04:17.317
you must answer all four...

04:17.350 --> 04:20.052
Until then, I'll be working
with Detective Small.

04:20.086 --> 04:21.387
- Small?
- Very.

04:21.420 --> 04:22.788
How's it going?

04:25.636 --> 04:27.004
What else did I miss?

04:27.037 --> 04:29.239
Next you're gonna tell me
you're seeing someone else.

04:29.273 --> 04:31.674
Geils! Tribeca!

04:31.708 --> 04:32.943
Get the hell in here!

04:32.975 --> 04:34.477
Coming, Lieutenant.

04:39.482 --> 04:42.285
- You wanted to see us, sir?
- Tribeca.

04:42.319 --> 04:43.520
How you doing, kid?

04:43.552 --> 04:45.221
Well, considering a year ago

04:45.254 --> 04:47.124
they were sweeping up my
brains with a dustpan...

04:48.458 --> 04:49.493
Bless you.

04:52.828 --> 04:54.131
How are you, sir?

04:54.163 --> 04:56.299
Well, since I'm now a year
away from retirement,

04:56.333 --> 04:58.969
the department requires
I start building a boat

04:59.001 --> 05:00.069
with a whimsical name.

05:00.102 --> 05:01.704
But I'm not gonna lie.

05:03.122 --> 05:05.869
The Thousand Tomorrows is
a long way from setting sail.

05:05.870 --> 05:08.940
Geils, I got a fresh murder in for you.

05:08.974 --> 05:12.010
Tribeca, the shrink
wants you riding a desk

05:12.044 --> 05:13.254
till you're back on your feet.

05:13.255 --> 05:14.558
I'm ready to work, Lieutenant.

05:14.590 --> 05:16.892
You just got out of a
coma, for God's sake.

05:16.926 --> 05:18.928
Hey! If Tribeca says she's
ready, then she's ready.

05:18.962 --> 05:21.765
Or do I have to show you my fist?

05:22.464 --> 05:24.534
Well, it's not like we don't need you.

05:25.368 --> 05:26.305
It's an election year,

05:26.306 --> 05:30.175
and the mayor insists
I crack down on murder.

05:30.207 --> 05:32.610
Anything for a couple of votes.

05:32.611 --> 05:34.046
There's a John Doe in the dog park

05:34.079 --> 05:35.380
at the top of Laurel Canyon.

05:35.413 --> 05:36.615
Check it out.

05:40.551 --> 05:42.334
You really think she's ready?

05:43.822 --> 05:45.958
I don't know, Lieutenant.

05:45.990 --> 05:47.091
I don't know.

05:50.829 --> 05:52.064
Wait! Wait, wait! No!

05:52.096 --> 05:54.532
No, no! Come on, come on, come on!

05:54.565 --> 05:56.368
No, no! This is a crime scene!

06:02.974 --> 06:06.344
You might want to take a look at it.

06:11.615 --> 06:13.818
Good boy. All right.

06:13.858 --> 06:15.694
What are we looking at, Tanner?

06:15.753 --> 06:17.655
Got the call about 7:00 this morning.

06:17.688 --> 06:20.391
Guy walks his dog in the park.

06:20.425 --> 06:21.660
Just chillin'.

06:21.692 --> 06:23.894
All of a sudden, sees a body...

06:23.928 --> 06:25.430
dead and buried.

06:25.462 --> 06:26.998
Well, not all the way buried,

06:27.031 --> 06:30.736
but definitely all the way dead.

06:30.769 --> 06:33.005
- Let's take a look.
- Yeah.

06:35.639 --> 06:37.743
Dr. Scholls.

06:37.776 --> 06:39.511
Tribeca. Welcome back.

06:39.543 --> 06:41.947
Hello, lover.

06:49.553 --> 06:52.089
Oh, that's right.

06:52.123 --> 06:54.026
You didn't know.

07:05.570 --> 07:06.971
Do we know how he died?

07:07.005 --> 07:08.606
We found some bruising on his neck,

07:08.639 --> 07:10.007
so strangulation's a possibility.

07:10.041 --> 07:12.110
Anyone else in the park
when they found the body?

07:12.142 --> 07:13.878
Just a trainer that
comes here every day...

07:13.911 --> 07:15.147
Anne Muffet.

07:15.180 --> 07:17.049
Said she's seen the deceased
in the park before,

07:17.082 --> 07:18.216
but never spoke to him.

07:18.248 --> 07:19.885
Let's take a look at
our John Doe's name.

07:19.918 --> 07:22.087
If he still has his wallet,
it wasn't a robbery.

07:23.488 --> 07:25.858
Jonathan Dough.

07:33.679 --> 07:35.075
What do we got, Scholls?

07:35.076 --> 07:36.612
We turned Dough's apartment upside down.

07:36.646 --> 07:38.681
Didn't find a thing.

07:38.713 --> 07:40.048
Keep us posted.

07:40.081 --> 07:42.050
Will do.

07:42.083 --> 07:44.720
Angie, listen, me and Scholls...

07:44.754 --> 07:45.888
It's fine, Geils.

07:45.922 --> 07:47.390
They said even if you did wake up,

07:47.422 --> 07:48.524
you wouldn't be you anymore.

07:48.557 --> 07:50.259
You'd be a distant echo.

07:50.292 --> 07:51.227
A memory.

07:51.259 --> 07:53.462
More shadow than human being.

07:53.496 --> 07:55.298
- And fat.
- I get it.

07:55.331 --> 07:57.434
You think I would have
waited around for you?

07:57.466 --> 07:59.034
- No way.
- Yeah, right.

07:59.067 --> 08:01.470
No way.

08:02.304 --> 08:03.939
All right, well, Scholls
thinks I had the baby

08:03.981 --> 08:05.137
with some chick in Canada...

08:05.138 --> 08:06.704
Yeah, don't worry about it.

08:06.737 --> 08:09.974
But, uh, if you had some
pictures you could send,

08:10.006 --> 08:11.309
I-I'd like that.

08:11.903 --> 08:13.566
Well, I kind of made
her up, so I don't...

08:13.567 --> 08:16.303
- The baby.
- You guys looking for John Dough?

08:16.336 --> 08:17.971
Anything you can tell us about him?

08:18.005 --> 08:19.841
Moved in two weeks ago.

08:19.873 --> 08:21.341
Had this weird thing

08:21.375 --> 08:24.045
about not being in a good
mood most of the time.

08:24.077 --> 08:26.013
I don't want to call him sad, but...

08:26.046 --> 08:28.683
And what about his routine?
Anything out of the ordinary?

08:28.716 --> 08:30.418
Every day around 8:30, he'd come out

08:30.450 --> 08:33.320
with this rectangular box with a handle

08:33.354 --> 08:35.089
and some kind of hot beverage.

08:35.121 --> 08:36.558
He'd be gone all day.

08:36.591 --> 08:39.077
Then, around 6:00, he's back.

08:39.078 --> 08:40.847
Box, no beverage.

08:40.880 --> 08:42.881
Then you don't hear from
him all night long.

08:42.914 --> 08:45.352
Boom! Next morning, box and beverage.

08:45.385 --> 08:47.354
I don't want to say
he lived and slept here

08:47.386 --> 08:49.488
and then went to work, but...

08:49.521 --> 08:50.823
Friends? Acquaintances?

08:50.857 --> 08:52.324
This was weird.

08:52.357 --> 08:55.127
He had this woman
that he was married to.

08:55.160 --> 08:58.698
Then they decided to stop being
married and live separately.

08:58.731 --> 09:02.335
I don't want to say divorce, but...

09:10.242 --> 09:11.410
Can I help you?

09:11.444 --> 09:12.846
Jane Dough? LAPD.

09:12.878 --> 09:15.214
It's "Douzjh." The "G-H" is pronounced.

09:15.247 --> 09:16.382
Can we come in?

09:16.415 --> 09:19.486
We're very sorry to hear
about your ex-husband.

09:19.519 --> 09:20.540
Are you?

09:20.541 --> 09:21.943
Tribeca, take it easy.

09:21.975 --> 09:23.010
I'm fine.

09:23.043 --> 09:24.278
Just because we're divorced

09:24.311 --> 09:25.729
doesn't mean I'm happy that he's dead.

09:26.034 --> 09:27.267
We were high-school sweethearts.

09:27.293 --> 09:28.261
Ever since college.

09:28.294 --> 09:29.795
When was the last time you saw him?

09:29.828 --> 09:32.097
- Not dead, I mean.
- Last night.

09:32.131 --> 09:35.168
I dropped by his new place
around 8:00 to pick up our dog.

09:35.201 --> 09:36.770
We had an argument, and I left.

09:36.803 --> 09:38.237
What was the argument about?

09:38.270 --> 09:40.640
I told him to get some plants
for his new apartment...

09:40.673 --> 09:42.775
which, of course, made him furious.

09:42.809 --> 09:44.077
I just find plants and animals

09:44.110 --> 09:45.579
liven a place up a
little bit, don't you?

09:46.712 --> 09:48.747
Yeah. So do humans.

09:48.780 --> 09:50.083
The scratch marks on your neck...

09:50.116 --> 09:51.818
Was there some sort
of physical altercation?

09:51.851 --> 09:54.254
I'm afraid Bruce has a little
bit of a flea problem.

09:55.454 --> 09:57.623
Don't you find it unusual
that your ex-husband

09:57.656 --> 09:59.592
was at the dog park without a dog?

09:59.626 --> 10:01.461
Should I be speaking to a lawyer?

10:01.493 --> 10:02.292
No, ma'am.

10:02.293 --> 10:04.783
That would make our job a lot harder.

10:07.980 --> 10:09.464
The ex-wife doesn't have an alibi,

10:09.490 --> 10:11.556
but until we find a murder
weapon or a cause of death,

10:11.582 --> 10:12.793
we have nothing on her.

10:12.819 --> 10:15.393
Jane Dough wasn't the last
person to see him alive.

10:15.777 --> 10:16.859
Seems he had an appointment

10:16.860 --> 10:19.552
with the dog trainer,
Anne Muffet, at 11:00 p.m.

10:19.578 --> 10:21.380
Tanner, you and Small
take a run at Muffet.

10:21.412 --> 10:24.015
About that, sir. I can't
find Detective Small.

10:24.048 --> 10:25.828
- What do you mean, you can't find her?
- I mean I looked everywhere.

10:25.829 --> 10:28.232
I retraced my footsteps,
looked in the lost and found.

10:28.264 --> 10:29.466
I'm really sorry.

10:29.499 --> 10:32.702
Well, a new detective is
coming out of your paycheck.

10:32.743 --> 10:33.711
Oh, that's cold.

10:34.163 --> 10:35.180
Geils,

10:35.181 --> 10:38.714
you and Tribeca see what you can
dig up on the Dough divorce.

10:39.141 --> 10:40.611
Hey.

10:42.886 --> 10:44.321
How's she holding up?

10:44.960 --> 10:47.676
I think you meant
to pull aside Geils, sir.

10:48.885 --> 10:50.620
Right.

10:51.447 --> 10:52.929
All right, well, if you see him around,

10:52.955 --> 10:54.557
ask him how you're holding up.

10:54.590 --> 10:56.826
Will do.

10:56.859 --> 10:59.162
Thanks for coming in, Miss Muffet.

10:59.195 --> 11:00.997
I have a few questions to ask you.

11:01.031 --> 11:02.399
Sit!

11:02.431 --> 11:04.801
Shake.

11:06.569 --> 11:08.839
Did you have an appointment
with a John Dough

11:08.872 --> 11:10.241
at 11:00 p.m. last night?

11:10.273 --> 11:11.608
Mm... maybe.

11:11.641 --> 11:12.843
I have a lot of clients.

11:12.876 --> 11:14.011
It's really difficult to keep track.

11:14.044 --> 11:15.346
Well, let me refresh your memory.

11:15.378 --> 11:16.747
It's the dead guy in the park

11:16.780 --> 11:18.348
that you claim you never spoke to.

11:18.382 --> 11:19.683
No. No!

11:19.715 --> 11:22.352
Well, we have a calendar
entry on John Dough's phone

11:22.386 --> 11:24.387
saying that he had an appointment
with you last night.

11:24.420 --> 11:26.089
You know what?
Now that I think about it,

11:26.122 --> 11:27.523
we did have a session last night.

11:27.556 --> 11:29.292
Training dogs at 11:00 p.m.?

11:29.325 --> 11:31.361
Mr. Dough had a day job.

11:31.395 --> 11:33.030
He could only do sessions at night

11:33.063 --> 11:34.765
on the days he had custody of the dog.

11:34.797 --> 11:36.466
So you knew about his divorce.

11:36.499 --> 11:38.134
Drop it. Drop it!

11:38.167 --> 11:41.304
This morning you claimed you
never even spoke to the man.

11:41.338 --> 11:43.707
Now you know details
about his personal life,

11:43.739 --> 11:45.908
training sessions with him
in the middle of the night.

11:45.941 --> 11:48.411
The relationship between
a trainer and their client

11:48.444 --> 11:50.214
and their client's dog is privileged.

11:50.247 --> 11:53.817
I did not go to six weeks
of online dog-training school

11:53.849 --> 11:56.387
to betray the cornerstone
of my profession.

11:56.420 --> 11:57.820
Now if you are finished...

11:57.853 --> 11:59.956
Baby, I'm nowhere near
finished with you.

11:59.989 --> 12:01.891
I have a security camera in my home.

12:01.925 --> 12:03.394
Check the footage at 11:55 last night

12:03.426 --> 12:07.397
and you will see John Dough
leaving my house alive.

12:07.430 --> 12:08.666
And now I am leaving.

12:08.699 --> 12:10.300
- Hmph.
- Wait.

12:10.334 --> 12:11.401
Wait.

12:11.435 --> 12:13.237
Wa-a-a-a-it.

12:13.270 --> 12:14.405
Okay!

12:20.944 --> 12:23.113
I think I got fleas
from that lady's house.

12:23.146 --> 12:25.082
Oh, look, it's the care phone.

12:25.114 --> 12:26.582
It's for you. Guess who it is.

12:26.616 --> 12:28.252
Nobody.

12:28.285 --> 12:30.353
Then who said it was for me?

12:30.387 --> 12:32.922
Hi. Sorry we kept you waiting.

12:32.955 --> 12:35.526
Let the record show

12:35.559 --> 12:38.295
that we are talking to
Neil and Penelope Quigley,

12:38.328 --> 12:41.031
who represented John Dough
in his divorce from his wife.

12:41.064 --> 12:42.933
We're sitting in a drab office

12:42.965 --> 12:45.168
decorated with generic
artwork on the walls.

12:45.201 --> 12:47.036
Neil is a tall man. Medium build.

12:47.069 --> 12:49.138
Colors his hair. Not fooling anybody.

12:49.171 --> 12:50.507
Penelope's a hot little number,

12:50.540 --> 12:52.376
though her best years
are probably behind her.

12:52.409 --> 12:54.545
But back in the day, mm-mmm!

12:54.578 --> 12:56.714
Mr. and Mrs. Quigley,
thank you for talking to us.

12:56.747 --> 13:00.050
Of course. We were devastated
to hear about John's death.

13:00.083 --> 13:02.886
I could swear he had three
or four more divorces in him.

13:02.919 --> 13:04.121
Was there anything about the divorce

13:04.154 --> 13:05.456
that would make you think Mrs. Dough

13:05.488 --> 13:06.723
would want to harm her husband?

13:06.757 --> 13:07.971
It was pretty cut and dry.

13:07.997 --> 13:10.713
The only sticking point
was the custody of the dog.

13:10.747 --> 13:12.365
I don't even think John
wanted that little rat,

13:12.366 --> 13:14.734
but Jane did, so I got it for him.

13:14.767 --> 13:17.207
He means we got it for him.

13:17.410 --> 13:19.940
He sometimes forgets that both
of our names are on the door.

13:19.972 --> 13:22.074
Though my name does come first.

13:22.108 --> 13:23.276
Which no one could possibly know

13:23.308 --> 13:24.677
because we have the same name.

13:24.711 --> 13:25.673
Are we okay?

13:25.674 --> 13:28.037
Sometimes my husband
can be a little insensitive...

13:28.063 --> 13:30.113
and even less often get an erection.

13:30.378 --> 13:34.182
Sometimes my wife can't do
anything sexy, anything at all.

13:34.215 --> 13:35.950
But if she could, me and my erection

13:35.983 --> 13:37.353
would be first in line for that show.

13:37.386 --> 13:38.920
My erection and I.

13:40.764 --> 13:42.223
Ohh! That's the spot!

13:42.256 --> 13:44.959
Oh, I swear, building
this boat's gonna kill me.

13:44.992 --> 13:48.731
So, John Dough loses
interest in his wife.

13:48.763 --> 13:50.932
Then he gets the dog in the divorce.

13:50.965 --> 13:53.468
They fight about it, and she kills him.

13:53.502 --> 13:56.037
But he was seen alive coming
out of the trainer's place.

13:56.070 --> 13:58.040
And she knows he'll be
at the dog park in the morning,

13:58.073 --> 14:01.266
so she waits for him,
strangles him, takes the dog,

14:01.329 --> 14:02.996
and then does her best to bury the body.

14:03.022 --> 14:04.600
But we haven't confirmed strangulation

14:04.651 --> 14:05.481
is the cause of death.

14:05.513 --> 14:07.382
Plus, that trainer woman
knows a hell of a lot more

14:07.415 --> 14:09.484
- than what she's letting on.
- Mm.

14:15.886 --> 14:17.296
Oh, can I help you there?

14:17.890 --> 14:19.681
Oh. Yes, thank you, Dr. Edelweiss.

14:19.682 --> 14:21.380
You know, these vending machines

14:21.381 --> 14:23.730
are going to make me
an absolute fortune.

14:23.731 --> 14:24.884
Now, what can I get you?

14:24.917 --> 14:27.421
Uh, the blackberry brandy
and the pink-and-white pills.

14:27.454 --> 14:28.955
Oh, yes. An excellent choice.

14:28.989 --> 14:32.892
Now let me show you something
we found on your John Dough.

14:35.161 --> 14:36.530
It was very astute of you

14:36.562 --> 14:39.131
to notice the bruise marks on his neck.

14:39.165 --> 14:40.400
- He'd been strangled.
- Aha!

14:40.432 --> 14:41.801
- But not to death.
- Huh?

14:41.835 --> 14:43.402
Someone had placed
something around his neck...

14:43.436 --> 14:45.605
- a cord or a belt.
- Ah.

14:45.638 --> 14:48.041
- But the trachea was intact.
- O-ho!

14:48.074 --> 14:50.544
It was tight enough, of course,
to cause some severe damage.

14:50.576 --> 14:52.378
- Yayayaya.
- But whoever did this

14:52.412 --> 14:54.114
knew exactly at which point to stop.

14:54.147 --> 14:55.449
Mm!

14:55.482 --> 14:57.117
- It's possible that...
- Nobody asked you!

14:59.319 --> 15:00.654
Hey, if you're gonna lose your mind

15:00.686 --> 15:02.121
every time you fall into a coma

15:02.155 --> 15:03.323
and I abandon you for another woman,

15:03.355 --> 15:04.557
who then raises your baby

15:04.590 --> 15:06.225
thinking it's my Canadian love child,

15:06.258 --> 15:07.728
it's gonna be a long second season.

15:07.761 --> 15:09.263
Fine.

15:10.305 --> 15:13.409
Aah! Dang it. Now I have fleas.

15:13.599 --> 15:16.503
- So, what killed him?
- He was poisoned.

15:16.536 --> 15:18.443
A routine toxicology report

15:18.444 --> 15:20.480
revealed a lethal dose of pyrethrin.

15:20.512 --> 15:21.680
What's pyrethrin?

15:21.713 --> 15:22.848
You don't know?

15:22.881 --> 15:24.282
My job is safe.

15:24.315 --> 15:27.185
Pyrethrin is an extract from
the chrysanthemum flower

15:27.218 --> 15:29.588
and a common ingredient in pesticides.

15:29.621 --> 15:31.123
Pesticide.

15:33.958 --> 15:35.462
Geils.

15:37.496 --> 15:40.667
Pesticide.

15:41.799 --> 15:43.769
We need an arrest
warrant for Jane Dough.

15:43.802 --> 15:44.937
I'll call the D.A.

15:44.970 --> 15:47.606
Mm.

15:47.640 --> 15:49.208
I didn't have any cash.

15:52.720 --> 15:54.623
- But I didn't do anything!
- That's enough, Jane.

15:55.039 --> 15:56.174
I'll do the talking.

15:56.207 --> 15:57.875
But she didn't do anything!

15:57.907 --> 15:59.309
We have a man who was poisoned

15:59.343 --> 16:01.746
and a bitter ex-wife with
motive, opportunity,

16:01.779 --> 16:04.515
and a pantry full of pesticides.

16:04.548 --> 16:07.218
I didn't kill Jonathan. I loved him.

16:07.251 --> 16:08.528
He just didn't love me.

16:08.554 --> 16:10.088
It all started in the bedroom.

16:10.121 --> 16:12.689
He kept wanting to do
weirder and weirder stuff.

16:12.723 --> 16:14.309
How weird? What stuff?

16:14.335 --> 16:15.093
How weird?

16:15.126 --> 16:16.394
Don't answer that.

16:16.426 --> 16:19.196
But if you want to,
that would be awesome.

16:20.030 --> 16:22.199
I just don't feel comfortable.

16:23.083 --> 16:24.920
But if it would help...

16:25.243 --> 16:27.345
He wanted us to...

16:27.371 --> 16:28.740
I can't.

16:28.772 --> 16:30.107
I can't.

16:30.141 --> 16:32.910
But I did not kill him, I swear to God.

16:32.943 --> 16:35.513
God may believe you, but a jury won't.

16:35.545 --> 16:37.381
Take her away.

16:37.414 --> 16:40.518
That may be the coolest
thing I ever said.

16:40.550 --> 16:42.420
My plants!

16:44.829 --> 16:47.199
Well, I'm gonna take off for the night.

16:47.225 --> 16:48.706
Crazy first day back, huh?

16:48.835 --> 16:50.160
Nothing I can't handle.

16:52.632 --> 16:54.431
I do love you, Tribeca.

16:56.766 --> 16:57.968
What?

16:58.001 --> 16:59.237
I said "good night."

17:02.006 --> 17:03.241
Hi.

17:03.274 --> 17:04.708
I'm glad we switched to cloth diapers.

17:04.742 --> 17:07.111
I'm wearing mine, too!

17:07.144 --> 17:08.944
Hey.

17:10.313 --> 17:13.083
You know what always
makes me feel better?

17:13.117 --> 17:15.086
A big bag of Dick's.

17:17.288 --> 17:19.357
Great. I'm starving.

17:22.871 --> 17:24.006
Thanks.

17:24.079 --> 17:27.732
So, Jane Dough goes down
for murdering her husband.

17:27.763 --> 17:28.932
Love's funny, ain't it?

17:28.965 --> 17:30.133
Love is funny.

17:30.166 --> 17:31.769
And it's freaky.

17:31.801 --> 17:34.605
You wouldn't believe what I
saw at the trainer's house.

17:34.637 --> 17:37.308
Yeah, I got coffee at
your place this morning.

17:37.340 --> 17:39.776
I had a little white detective with me.

17:39.809 --> 17:41.945
Did anyone turn one in?

17:41.979 --> 17:43.915
Yeah, I'll hold.

17:50.354 --> 17:52.123
She had a leash around his neck?

17:52.155 --> 17:53.590
Some messed-up shit.

17:53.624 --> 17:54.759
Ugh!

17:54.791 --> 17:56.727
These fleabites.

17:58.796 --> 18:00.998
Fleas.

18:06.169 --> 18:07.470
Now that Tribeca's awake,

18:07.503 --> 18:11.809
I suppose you want to leave me for her.

18:11.841 --> 18:13.476
No. No, of course not.

18:13.510 --> 18:15.946
Besides, she has no
feelings for me anymore.

18:16.880 --> 18:17.982
Geils.

18:18.014 --> 18:19.449
Tribeca!

18:19.482 --> 18:20.818
Sorry to interrupt your dinner.

18:20.850 --> 18:22.652
Oh, don't even worry about it.

18:23.333 --> 18:26.971
I realized something that's
gonna make you very, very happy.

18:27.142 --> 18:28.792
Shh! You don't have to say it.

18:33.364 --> 18:34.999
Jane Dough is innocent.

18:35.031 --> 18:36.333
Oh. The case.

18:40.522 --> 18:41.924
It was the fleabites.

18:41.950 --> 18:44.468
Everyone had them... you,
me, the wife, the dog.

18:44.494 --> 18:45.542
So everyone has fleas.

18:45.576 --> 18:47.078
The dog has fleas, gave
them to everybody.

18:47.133 --> 18:48.410
Almost everybody.

18:48.436 --> 18:49.905
Dr. Scholls, how many fleabites

18:49.931 --> 18:51.404
did John Dough have on his body?

18:51.430 --> 18:53.317
There were no fleabites
on John Dough's body.

18:53.349 --> 18:54.853
Oh, what do you know?!

18:54.879 --> 18:56.248
Wait. Yes, that's right.

18:56.274 --> 18:58.043
John Dough had no fleabites

18:58.069 --> 19:01.005
because fleas wouldn't touch
him because pyrethrin,

19:01.044 --> 19:03.062
which is the active
ingredient in pesticides,

19:03.088 --> 19:06.026
is also the active
ingredient in flea medicine.

19:06.027 --> 19:07.503
- But who...
- The trainer.

19:07.504 --> 19:09.406
She was into some weird
role-playing stuff

19:09.440 --> 19:10.674
where John Dough pretended to be a dog.

19:10.708 --> 19:12.143
Does somebody want a treat?

19:12.175 --> 19:14.177
Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?

19:14.211 --> 19:15.936
Oh, my good...

19:15.937 --> 19:17.139
Dough gets fleas.

19:17.172 --> 19:19.141
Naturally, she gives him medicine.

19:19.175 --> 19:20.209
She gives him too much.

19:20.242 --> 19:22.412
He dies. She panics.

19:22.445 --> 19:24.746
She buries him in the park.

19:24.780 --> 19:27.250
Even though we only have
her for manslaughter,

19:27.283 --> 19:29.151
I think we can get her under murder one.

19:29.185 --> 19:31.154
She's gonna fry like bacon.

19:31.187 --> 19:32.255
It all makes sense.

19:32.528 --> 19:33.729
Sorry, Monica.

19:33.755 --> 19:35.842
We've got to go arrest the dog trainer.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.310
No, you stay and eat.

19:37.717 --> 19:39.227
I'm fine on my own.

19:39.261 --> 19:41.431
I always have been.

19:41.464 --> 19:43.433
You're never on your own.

19:43.731 --> 19:45.494
See you in the morning, partner.

19:46.190 --> 19:47.602
See you in the morning.

19:47.636 --> 19:48.937
Oh.

19:48.970 --> 19:50.305
And, hey, Geils?

19:50.339 --> 19:52.341
Why don't you take this?

19:52.374 --> 19:54.310
I don't need it anymore.

19:55.311 --> 19:56.312
It's empty.

19:56.344 --> 19:58.480
Yeah. Can you toss it for me?

20:02.685 --> 20:04.821
Sit down! Okay, okay, okay, okay!

20:04.861 --> 20:06.129
Down! Sit down!

20:06.155 --> 20:07.963
Anne Muffet, you're under arrest

20:07.989 --> 20:09.420
for the murder of Jonathan Dough.

20:09.421 --> 20:10.556
You have the right to remain silent.

20:10.589 --> 20:11.690
Anything you sa...

20:11.723 --> 20:14.698
Hello! Who's this little guy?

20:14.724 --> 20:15.560
Hi!

20:15.593 --> 20:16.794
Hello.

20:16.828 --> 20:18.764
Tribeca, I thought you hated dogs.

20:18.796 --> 20:20.298
Yeah, there's something about this one.

20:20.331 --> 20:23.968
Oh, you like your belly
scratched, don't you?

20:24.002 --> 20:25.571
Yes, you do.

20:25.603 --> 20:28.407
I think you've been working
a little too hard, Tribeca.

20:28.439 --> 20:29.574
Why don't you head on home?

20:29.608 --> 20:30.576
We'll handle Miss Muffet.

20:30.609 --> 20:32.077
Thanks, Tanner.

20:47.292 --> 20:49.927
You know what? I'm sorry.

20:49.960 --> 20:51.329
This is super-weird.

20:51.362 --> 20:53.164
Yeah, I should go now.

20:53.197 --> 20:55.801
My son graduates tomorrow.

21:02.506 --> 21:04.342
Tribeca.

21:04.376 --> 21:07.112
Angie. It's me.

21:07.145 --> 21:08.847
Sergeant Pepper?

21:08.879 --> 21:10.983
Eddie?
