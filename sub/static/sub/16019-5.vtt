00:07.549 --> 00:08.509
AND JAMES VAN DER BEEK!

00:08.550 --> 00:09.969
(June) SOONER OR LATER,

00:10.010 --> 00:12.847
WE ALL HAVE TO FACE

00:10.010 --> 00:12.847
OUR OWN MOMENT OF TRUTH.

00:12.888 --> 00:16.308
AFTER ALL THE HARD WORK,

00:12.888 --> 00:16.308
THE COUNTLESS HOURS OF SWEAT,

00:16.350 --> 00:18.226
TEARS, AND PREPARATION,

00:18.268 --> 00:20.061
JAMES WAS ABOUT TO FACE HIS.

00:20.103 --> 00:23.064
IT MADE ME WONDER, WHEN I WAS

00:20.103 --> 00:23.064
FACED WITH MY MOMENT OF TRUTH,

00:23.106 --> 00:24.232
WHEN THE SPOTLIGHT WAS ON ME,

00:24.274 --> 00:25.943
HOW WOULD I RESPOND?

00:25.985 --> 00:28.445
I CAN'T COME IN TO WORK TODAY.

00:25.985 --> 00:28.445
I'M IN THE HOSPITAL.

00:28.487 --> 00:31.072
I BURNED MY FINGERTIPS OFF

00:28.487 --> 00:31.072
SAVING A BUNCH OF CUBANS

00:31.114 --> 00:32.658
FROM A BAKERY FIRE.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.075
TURNS OUT--NOT WELL.

00:34.117 --> 00:37.078
ALSO, I HAVE BLACK LUNG.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.079
(imitates wheezing)

00:38.121 --> 00:40.081
NOT WELL AT ALL.

00:40.123 --> 00:42.376

VALENTINA AND I ARE GONNA WIN

01:02.021 --> 01:03.146
(microphone feedback whines)

01:03.188 --> 01:04.773
(amplified voice) I WOULD

01:03.188 --> 01:04.773
TAKE A BULLET FOR THIS MAN.

01:04.815 --> 01:05.983
(clenched teeth)

01:04.815 --> 01:05.983
LUTHER, TIGHTEN IT UP.

01:06.025 --> 01:07.108
MY AGENT'S HERE.

01:07.150 --> 01:08.777
DID YOU HEAR THAT, MOM?

01:07.150 --> 01:08.777
(Connie) So exciting.

01:08.819 --> 01:11.112
YEAH, JAMES AND LUTHER

01:08.819 --> 01:11.112
ARE LEAVING FOR L.A. TOMORROW.

01:11.154 --> 01:12.280
What's James doing now?

01:12.322 --> 01:15.534
UH, RIGHT NOW

01:12.322 --> 01:15.534
JAMES AND LUTHER ARE...

01:15.576 --> 01:18.119
ARM WRESTLING OVER

01:15.576 --> 01:18.119
A GLASS OF WHITE WINE.

01:18.161 --> 01:20.205
(stammering)

01:18.161 --> 01:20.205
(murmuring indistinctly)

01:20.247 --> 01:22.541
OH, I'M SO EXCITED FOR YOU

01:20.247 --> 01:22.541
TO COME HERE!

01:22.583 --> 01:25.044
ME, TOO. I'VE NEVER

01:22.583 --> 01:25.044
BEEN TO NEW YORK.

01:25.084 --> 01:28.129
It'll be so much fun watching

01:25.084 --> 01:28.129
the premiere with you.

01:28.171 --> 01:29.297
WAIT WAIT. IS THAT

01:28.171 --> 01:29.297
MY FAVORITE M.I.L.T.T.T.?

01:29.339 --> 01:31.050
"MOTHER I LIKE TO TALK TO"?

01:31.090 --> 01:33.218
COME HERE.

01:31.090 --> 01:33.218
CONNIE, MY DANCE GURU.

01:33.260 --> 01:35.220
I WOULD NOT BE HERE

01:33.260 --> 01:35.220
WITHOUT YOU.

01:35.262 --> 01:36.513
I FEEL SO READY,

01:35.262 --> 01:36.513
AND BY THE WAY,

01:36.555 --> 01:37.639
YOU WERE SO RIGHT

01:36.555 --> 01:37.639
ABOUT THE RAISINS.

01:37.681 --> 01:39.058
THEY DID THE TRICK.

01:39.098 --> 01:40.141
(chuckles) L.A.

01:40.183 --> 01:43.020
I ACTUALLY KNOW A LOT

01:40.183 --> 01:43.020
ABOUT THE BUSINESS.

01:43.062 --> 01:44.354
I WAS A FAMOUS BABY ACTOR.

01:44.396 --> 01:46.648
I WAS IN A MOVIE--

01:44.396 --> 01:46.648
YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD OF IT--

01:46.690 --> 01:48.525
CALLED, UM,

01:46.690 --> 01:48.525
"THREE MEN AND A BABY."

01:48.567 --> 01:50.402
CHLOE, THAT IS NOT TRUE.

01:48.567 --> 01:50.402
YOU CAN'T JUST TELL PEOPLE

01:50.444 --> 01:52.195
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

01:52.237 --> 01:54.031
WHAT? I'M JUST HAVING

01:52.237 --> 01:54.031
SOME FUN.

01:54.073 --> 01:56.533
YEAH, SO THERE ARE

01:54.073 --> 01:56.533
SEVERAL FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS

01:56.575 --> 01:58.744
OF ME CURLED UP

01:56.575 --> 01:58.744
IN TED DANSON'S WIG.

01:58.786 --> 02:00.245
IT'S ADORABLE.

02:00.287 --> 02:02.790
WAIT. DANSON HAD

02:00.287 --> 02:02.790
HIS REAL HAIR BACK THEN.

02:02.831 --> 02:04.792
WHAT DO YOU THINK

02:02.831 --> 02:04.792
ABOUT JIMMY FALLON?

02:04.833 --> 02:07.044
I LOVE HOW FALLON LAUGHS

02:04.833 --> 02:07.044
AT HIS OWN JOKES.

02:07.086 --> 02:08.336
YOU'RE WATCHING

02:07.086 --> 02:08.336
AND YOU'RE THINKING,

02:08.378 --> 02:10.338
"HE'S LAUGHING,

02:08.378 --> 02:10.338
SO IT MUST BE FUNNY."

02:10.380 --> 02:13.759
RIGHT. (laughs)

02:13.801 --> 02:15.010
YOU ARE SO LUCKY

02:15.052 --> 02:16.386
THAT EVERYONE HAS AN OPINION

02:15.052 --> 02:16.386
ON JIMMY FALLON.

02:16.428 --> 02:18.263
OTHERWISE, YOU'D BE

02:16.428 --> 02:18.263
TOTALLY BUSTED.

02:18.305 --> 02:20.390
RELAX. THEY'RE JUST

02:18.305 --> 02:20.390
SILLY LITTLE BAR LIES.

02:20.432 --> 02:21.809
IT DOESN'T HURT ANYBODY,

02:21.850 --> 02:23.184
AND WE GET ATTENTION

02:21.850 --> 02:23.184
AND FREE DRINKS.

02:23.226 --> 02:25.186
WHEN MY MOTHER COMES HERE,

02:23.226 --> 02:25.186
I'M GONNA HAVE HER

02:25.228 --> 02:27.815
TALK TO YOU ABOUT

02:25.228 --> 02:27.815
THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING HONEST.

02:27.856 --> 02:31.192
WE ARE DESCENDANTS OF

02:27.856 --> 02:31.192
"HONEST ABE" LINCOLN HIMSELF.

02:31.234 --> 02:33.278
WE ARE KNOWN

02:31.234 --> 02:33.278
AS THE "HONEST COLBURNS."

02:33.320 --> 02:36.448
JOCELYN?

02:33.320 --> 02:36.448
JOCELYN HOLMES, IS THAT YOU?

02:36.490 --> 02:38.492
IT'S JAMES VAN DER BEEK!

02:38.533 --> 02:41.578
I'M JUST IN TOWN VISITING

02:38.533 --> 02:41.578
MY COUSIN, KATIE HOLMES.

02:41.620 --> 02:44.205
(laughs) I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU

02:41.620 --> 02:44.205
SINCE OUR THREE-WAY.

02:44.247 --> 02:46.416
KATIE HOLMES' COUSIN?

02:46.458 --> 02:48.209
LET ME BUY YOU A DRINK.

02:48.251 --> 02:49.210
JAMES IS DOING

02:48.251 --> 02:49.210
MY FAVORITE BAR LIE

02:49.252 --> 02:51.212
AS A GOING-AWAY PRESENT.

02:51.254 --> 02:53.465
I'M GONNA MISS HIM SO MUCH.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.717
SO, YEAH, KATIE HOLMES AND I

02:53.507 --> 02:55.717
ARE ONLY COUSINS,

02:55.759 --> 02:58.303
BUT WE'RE AS FLIRTY

02:55.759 --> 02:58.303
AS SISTERS.

02:58.345 --> 03:00.014
THAT'S WEIRD.

03:00.055 --> 03:02.850
(June) AND THEN I'M GONNA TAKE

03:00.055 --> 03:02.850
MY MOM TO TIMES SQUARE,

03:02.891 --> 03:05.727
AND THEN I'M GONNA HAVE

03:02.891 --> 03:05.727
AN OLIVE OIL TASTING.

03:05.769 --> 03:06.728
(squeals)

03:05.769 --> 03:06.728
(laughs)

03:06.770 --> 03:10.231
I LOVE OLIVE OIL!

03:06.770 --> 03:10.231
I HATE MAYONNAISE.

03:10.273 --> 03:14.277
I HATE IT.

03:10.273 --> 03:14.277
(cell phone rings and beeps)

03:14.319 --> 03:17.238
JUNE, I'M AT THE JAR BAR.

03:14.319 --> 03:17.238
YOU HAVE TO GET DOWN HERE.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.240
I TOLD MY BAR LIE

03:17.280 --> 03:19.240
ABOUT HOW I INVENTED

03:19.282 --> 03:21.660
THAT SUPERIMPOSED YELLOW LINE

03:19.282 --> 03:21.660
FOR FOOTBALL GAMES ON TV,

03:21.702 --> 03:23.620
AND I'M GETTING

03:21.702 --> 03:23.620
A THOUSAND FREE DRINKS.

03:23.662 --> 03:26.331
THANKS TO YOU, MY GIRLFRIEND

03:23.662 --> 03:26.331
LOVES AND UNDERSTANDS FOOTBALL.

03:26.373 --> 03:28.042
GO, SPORTS TEAM.

03:28.083 --> 03:29.250
AS A HONEST COLBURN,

03:29.292 --> 03:31.252
IT IS MY OBLIGATION

03:29.292 --> 03:31.252
TO COME BAIL YOU OUT.

03:31.294 --> 03:34.422
IN RETURN, YOU ARE GOING TO GET

03:31.294 --> 03:34.422
MY SARAH McLACHLAN CD

03:34.464 --> 03:36.257
FROM THE CRACK BETWEEN

03:34.464 --> 03:36.257
THE COUNTER AND THE OVEN.

03:36.299 --> 03:37.926
(door opens, bells jingle)

03:36.299 --> 03:37.926
IT IS MY COOKING MUSIC.

03:37.968 --> 03:39.178
Get your ass down here--

03:37.968 --> 03:39.178
(beep)

03:39.219 --> 03:40.512
WAS THAT

03:39.219 --> 03:40.512
JAMES VAN DER BEEK?

03:40.554 --> 03:42.639
NO, PEPPER. NOT EVERYONE

03:40.554 --> 03:42.639
THAT CALLS ME

03:42.681 --> 03:44.265
IS JAMES VAN DER BEEK.

03:44.307 --> 03:46.267
I MEAN, DO I ASK YOU

03:44.307 --> 03:46.267
IF EVERY MALE CUSTOMER

03:46.309 --> 03:49.521
IS YOUR OLD SWIM COACH THAT

03:46.309 --> 03:49.521
TRIED TO GRAB YOUR BOOB?

03:52.524 --> 03:53.441
(horn blares in distance)

03:53.483 --> 03:55.276
SO I WAS DATING

03:53.483 --> 03:55.276
THE GUY FROM FOX SPORTS,

03:55.318 --> 03:56.987
AND I WAS LIKE,

03:55.318 --> 03:56.987
"YOU SHOULD REALLY SEE

03:57.029 --> 03:59.489
WHERE THE BALL'S

03:57.029 --> 03:59.489
SUPPOSED TO BE," YOU KNOW?

03:59.531 --> 04:02.367
ESPN WAS THE FIRST NETWORK

03:59.531 --> 04:02.367
TO USE THAT TECHNOLOGY.

04:02.409 --> 04:03.911
WHAT DO YOU THINK

04:02.409 --> 04:03.911
OF JIMMY FALLON?

04:03.952 --> 04:05.704
(scoffs) LOVE HIM!

04:03.952 --> 04:05.704
I HEARD HE MARRIED

04:05.746 --> 04:07.330
DREW BARRYMORE'S

04:05.746 --> 04:07.330
BUSINESS PARTNER.

04:07.372 --> 04:09.958
MM. (giggles)

04:07.372 --> 04:09.958
OH, FALLON. GOD.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.335
ONE DAY YOU ARE GONNA FALL

04:10.000 --> 04:12.335
SO DEEP DOWN YOUR LIE HOLE,

04:12.377 --> 04:14.171
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE

04:12.377 --> 04:14.171
TO GET OUT.

04:14.213 --> 04:15.463
UNLESS I FALL DOWN

04:14.213 --> 04:15.463
YOUR PIE HOLE FIRST,

04:15.505 --> 04:17.298
BECAUSE YOU KEEP YAPPIN'.

04:17.340 --> 04:18.717
(cell phone rings)

04:18.759 --> 04:19.885
(beep)

04:18.759 --> 04:19.885
HI, MOM!

04:19.927 --> 04:21.302
OH, MY GOSH.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.302
I WAS JUST GONNA CALL YOU.

04:21.344 --> 04:23.555
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU

04:21.344 --> 04:23.555
ABOUT OUR OLIVE OIL TASTING.

04:23.597 --> 04:26.225
HONEY, I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE

04:23.597 --> 04:26.225
TO VISIT YOU IN NEW YORK.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.684
OH, NO. WHY?

04:27.726 --> 04:29.310
YOUR FATHER'S

04:27.726 --> 04:29.310
NOT FEELING WELL,

04:29.352 --> 04:30.311
and, oh, I'm so sorry.

04:30.353 --> 04:33.023
IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.

04:30.353 --> 04:33.023
I-I UNDERSTAND.

04:33.065 --> 04:34.024
I GOTTA GET BACK

04:33.065 --> 04:34.024
TO YOUR FATHER.

04:34.066 --> 04:35.316
HE'S ON COLD MEDICINE,

04:35.358 --> 04:37.027
AND I'M AFRAID

04:35.358 --> 04:37.027
HE'S GONNA USE THE STOVE.

04:37.069 --> 04:38.403
DONALD!

04:38.445 --> 04:40.781
AND THIS LITTLE GUY PLAYED

04:38.445 --> 04:40.781
THE DOG IN "ANNIE" ON BROADWAY

04:40.822 --> 04:43.366
FOR EIGHT YEARS.

04:43.408 --> 04:44.785
CHLOE, WHERE DID YOU

04:43.408 --> 04:44.785
GET THAT?

04:44.826 --> 04:46.578
I FOUND HIM OUTSIDE

04:44.826 --> 04:46.578
WHEN YOU WERE ON THE PHONE.

04:46.620 --> 04:49.456
HILARIOUS, RIGHT?

04:46.620 --> 04:49.456
(whimpers)

04:53.376 --> 04:56.337
(Luther, singsongy)

04:53.376 --> 04:56.337
LOS ANGELES.

04:56.379 --> 04:59.174
LOOK AT US.

04:56.379 --> 04:59.174
WE'RE LIKE LUCY AND DESI.

05:00.383 --> 05:03.262
WHOO! ALL RIGHT. OH!

05:03.303 --> 05:06.347
OKAY, SO WE'RE SUPPOSED

05:03.303 --> 05:06.347

05:06.389 --> 05:07.641

05:07.682 --> 05:09.434
FINAL DRESS IS TOMORROW

05:07.682 --> 05:09.434

05:09.476 --> 05:10.769
LIVE SHOW, THE DAY AFTER.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.271
WAIT A MINUTE. LUTHER,

05:10.811 --> 05:12.271
I JUST REMEMBERED SOMETHING.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.355
DID WE LEAVE A CHECK

05:12.312 --> 05:14.355
FOR YOLANDA?

05:14.397 --> 05:15.440
WELL, NO, YOU'RE NOT

05:14.397 --> 05:15.440
GONNA BE AT YOUR PLACE.

05:15.482 --> 05:16.733
WHY WOULD THE MAID COME?

05:16.775 --> 05:17.943
WHY DO YOU HATE YOLANDA?

05:17.985 --> 05:20.737
(scoffs)

05:17.985 --> 05:20.737
I DO NOT HATE YOLANDA.

05:20.779 --> 05:22.823
IT'S JUST...

05:20.779 --> 05:22.823
IF YOU'RE EL SALVADORIAN,

05:22.864 --> 05:25.366
DON'T PRETEND

05:22.864 --> 05:25.366
TO BE GUATEMALAN, YOU KNOW?

05:25.408 --> 05:26.367
(cell phone beeps)

05:26.409 --> 05:28.620
(cell phone rings)

05:28.662 --> 05:30.371
(door bells jingle,

05:28.662 --> 05:30.371
cell phone beeps)

05:30.413 --> 05:33.750
HI, JAMES...

05:30.413 --> 05:33.750
VAN DER BEEK.

05:33.792 --> 05:35.169
LISTEN, CAN YOU DO ME

05:33.792 --> 05:35.169
A HUGE FAVOR?

05:35.210 --> 05:37.087
I THINK I FORGOT TO LEAVE

05:35.210 --> 05:37.087
A CHECK FOR MY MAID.

05:37.129 --> 05:39.298
CAN YOU GO TO MY PLACE

05:37.129 --> 05:39.298
AND WRITE ONE FOR HER?

05:39.338 --> 05:40.381
OH, OF COURSE.

05:39.338 --> 05:40.381
NO PROBLEM.

05:40.423 --> 05:43.760
OHH. THANK YOU.

05:40.423 --> 05:43.760
THE DOORMAN'S NAME IS...

05:43.802 --> 05:47.430
MARTIN. HE HAS A KEY.

05:43.802 --> 05:47.430
ALARM CODE IS 74,

05:47.472 --> 05:50.391
THE NUMBER OF TIMES

05:47.472 --> 05:50.391
JAMES HAS CRIED ON FILM.

05:50.433 --> 05:53.561
CHECKBOOK AND SIGNATURE STAMP

05:50.433 --> 05:53.561
ARE IN THE TOP DESK DRAWER.

05:53.603 --> 05:57.398
MAKE THE CHECK OUT

05:53.603 --> 05:57.398
TO YOLANDA MARTINEZ.

05:57.440 --> 06:00.401
OH, AND IN THE MEMO SECTION,

05:57.440 --> 06:00.401
WRITE "FOR BOOB JOB."

06:00.443 --> 06:02.403
IT'S A PRIVATE JOKE.

06:00.443 --> 06:02.403
SHE'LL KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.

06:02.445 --> 06:04.198
I AM ON IT, JAMES.

06:02.445 --> 06:04.198
DON'T YOU WORRY.

06:04.239 --> 06:06.407
MY MOTHER RAISED ME

06:04.239 --> 06:06.407
TO BE AN HONEST COLBURN.

06:06.449 --> 06:08.285
I WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN.

06:08.327 --> 06:10.411
THANK YOU, JUNE.

06:08.327 --> 06:10.411
I KNEW I COULD COUNT ON YOU.

06:10.453 --> 06:13.456
OBVIOUSLY, YOU KNOW, I CAN'T

06:10.453 --> 06:13.456
TRUST CHLOE TO DO IT, SO...

06:10.453 --> 06:13.456
(honks horn)

06:13.498 --> 06:14.708
WELL, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

06:14.749 --> 06:16.626
I MEAN, SHE TELLS BAR LIES

06:14.749 --> 06:16.626
TO GET FREE DRINKS,

06:16.668 --> 06:19.838
BUT DEEP DOWN,

06:16.668 --> 06:19.838
SHE IS A GOOD PERSON.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.090
IS THAT JOHN GOODMAN?

06:22.132 --> 06:23.800
GO. GO, GO, GO, GO,

06:22.132 --> 06:23.800
GO, GO, GO.

06:23.842 --> 06:27.679
(whirring)

06:27.721 --> 06:30.224
(beep)

06:27.721 --> 06:30.224
HE HAD TO GO.

06:27.721 --> 06:30.224
HE SAW JOHN GOODMAN.

06:30.265 --> 06:31.432
(gasps) "NORM!"

06:31.474 --> 06:32.684
(door bells jingle)

06:36.855 --> 06:39.733
AS YOU CAN SEE,

06:36.855 --> 06:39.733
GREAT LIGHT, CITY VIEWS.

06:39.774 --> 06:41.442
WAIT TILL YOU SEE

06:39.774 --> 06:41.442
THE MASTER BATH.

06:41.484 --> 06:43.028
CHLOE,

06:41.484 --> 06:43.028
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

06:43.070 --> 06:44.612
OH, HI.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.612
I'M BEING A REALTOR.

06:44.654 --> 06:47.615
I'M RENTING OUT JAMES' PLACE

06:44.654 --> 06:47.615
WHILE HE'S GONE.

06:47.657 --> 06:49.450
ANY QUESTIONS,

06:47.657 --> 06:49.450
DON'T HESITATE TO CALL.

06:49.492 --> 06:51.703
I'M ALL ABOUT PUTTING SOMEONE

06:49.492 --> 06:51.703
IN JAMES' HOME.

06:53.412 --> 06:54.413
(door slams)

06:58.793 --> 07:01.462
YOU'RE PRETENDING

06:58.793 --> 07:01.462
TO BE A REALTOR?

07:01.504 --> 07:05.466
CHLOE, THIS IS WAY WORSE

07:01.504 --> 07:05.466
THAN HARMLESS BAR LIES.

07:05.508 --> 07:06.676
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

07:06.718 --> 07:09.346
YES, I CAN. I ALWAYS

07:06.718 --> 07:09.346
RENT JAMES' APARTMENT

07:09.388 --> 07:11.098
WHEN HE GOES ON LOCATION

07:09.388 --> 07:11.098
FOR CHUNKS OF TIME.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.146
I MAKE EXTRA INCOME,

07:16.103 --> 07:18.146
SOME LUCKY FAMILY HAS

07:18.188 --> 07:20.481
AN AWESOME PLACE TO STAY,

07:18.188 --> 07:20.481
AND NO ONE'S THE WISER.

07:20.523 --> 07:22.483
YOU HAVE FALLEN DOWN

07:20.523 --> 07:22.483
YOUR LIE HOLE.

07:22.525 --> 07:24.485
YOU ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE

07:22.525 --> 07:24.485
OF JAMES.

07:24.527 --> 07:25.486
I HAVE TO TELL HIM.

07:25.528 --> 07:27.530
OH, DON'T TELL HIM. HI.

07:27.572 --> 07:29.490
SEE THAT VIEW?

07:27.572 --> 07:29.490
ICONIC MANHATTAN.

07:29.532 --> 07:31.868
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIE.

07:29.532 --> 07:31.868
JUST DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

07:31.910 --> 07:33.578
YOU CAN'T BE DISHONEST

07:31.910 --> 07:33.578
WITH YOUR MOUTH SHUT.

07:36.539 --> 07:37.498
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

07:37.540 --> 07:39.500
OMISSION IS NOT

07:37.540 --> 07:39.500
THE SAME AS LYING.

07:39.542 --> 07:41.002
NOW JAMES NEEDS TO FOCUS

07:39.542 --> 07:41.002
ON ONE THING,

07:41.044 --> 07:42.503
AND THAT'S DANCING.

07:42.545 --> 07:44.381
DON'T YOU THINK IT'S

07:42.545 --> 07:44.381
A LITTLE SELFISH AND UNFAIR

07:44.423 --> 07:46.758
TO SPRING THIS ON HIM NOW?

07:46.800 --> 07:48.509
I GUESS

07:46.800 --> 07:48.509
THIS ISN'T THE BEST TIME.

07:48.551 --> 07:51.512
NOT IF YOU WANT HIM TO WIN.

07:48.551 --> 07:51.512
SO YOU WON'T TELL HIM?

07:51.554 --> 07:55.976
(sighs) MAYBE IT IS BETTER

07:51.554 --> 07:55.976
THAT HE DOESN'T KNOW RIGHT NOW.

07:56.017 --> 07:57.518
(man over P.A.)

07:56.017 --> 07:57.518
FINAL DRESS REHEARSAL.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.562

07:59.604 --> 08:02.482

08:06.653 --> 08:09.114
OKAY, LOOK, THIS IS JUST

08:06.653 --> 08:09.114
REHEARSAL,  PAPI,  OKAY?

08:09.156 --> 08:10.531
LET'S SEE IF THEY

08:09.156 --> 08:10.531
CAN DO THIS TOMORROW

08:10.573 --> 08:12.533
WHEN THIS PLACE IS PACKED

08:10.573 --> 08:12.533
WITH SCREAMING FANS

08:12.575 --> 08:14.535
AND BROADCAST TO MILLIONS

08:12.575 --> 08:14.535

08:14.577 --> 08:15.536
I LET DEAN BORROW

08:14.577 --> 08:15.536
SOME OF YOUR BRONZER.

08:15.578 --> 08:16.537
YOU WHAT?!

08:16.579 --> 08:18.581
RELAX. FOCUS.

08:16.579 --> 08:18.581
AH-AH. AH-AH.

08:18.623 --> 08:20.708
FOCUS.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.210
(song ends)

08:22.252 --> 08:24.587
(amplified voice) GREAT. OKAY.

08:22.252 --> 08:24.587
DEAN AND KARINA WILL EXIT...

08:24.629 --> 08:25.755
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,

08:24.629 --> 08:25.755
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

JAMES, CAN'T THINK OF  YOU

09:33.656 --> 09:35.075
IT'S NEVER TO TELL A LIE.

09:35.116 --> 09:38.203
SO, YEAH, I MIGHT HAVE

09:35.116 --> 09:38.203
CHEATED ON THAT TEST.

09:38.245 --> 09:40.497
BUT I'D NEVER NOT TELL

09:38.245 --> 09:40.497
A GOOD FRIEND WHO TRUSTED ME

09:40.539 --> 09:43.624
THAT STRANGERS WERE STAYING

09:40.539 --> 09:43.624
IN MY KICK-ASS SoHo LOFT.

09:43.666 --> 09:44.625
AAH! NO!

09:44.667 --> 09:46.794
ACCIDENTALLY FLIPPED

09:44.667 --> 09:46.794
TO A C-SECTION ON TLC?

09:46.836 --> 09:48.046
I DO THAT ALL THE TIME.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.424
IT'S JAMES.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.424
HE'S ON EVERY CHANNEL.

09:50.465 --> 09:51.841
I THINK IT'S JUST MY GUILT.

09:51.883 --> 09:53.301
MAYBE HE'S JUST ON YOUR MIND.

09:53.343 --> 09:55.887
IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU WANNA MAKE

09:53.343 --> 09:55.887
LOVE TO A BOWLING PIN, RIGHT?

09:55.929 --> 09:58.639
AND THEN SUDDENLY, EVERYBODY

09:55.929 --> 09:58.639
LOOKS LIKE A BOWLING PIN.

THAT YOU DECIDED

10:19.953 --> 10:22.038
NOT TO RENT OUT JAMES' PLACE

10:33.216 --> 10:34.759
THIS IS WAY NICER

10:33.216 --> 10:34.759

AND I EVEN INVITED

10:34.801 --> 10:36.677
YOUR SISTER.

10:36.719 --> 10:38.679

10:53.736 --> 10:55.280

10:55.322 --> 10:56.281
SUBLETTING HIS PLACE.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.617
I'M SORRY, BUT IS IT NORMAL

10:58.658 --> 11:00.910

11:23.766 --> 11:26.645
DOWN HER LIE HOLE WITH HER.

11:26.685 --> 11:27.895
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU ARE.

11:27.937 --> 11:30.524
AN OMISSION IS THE SAME

11:27.937 --> 11:30.524
AS A LIE.

11:30.565 --> 11:31.650
(bell dings)

11:31.690 --> 11:32.691
OH.

11:35.778 --> 11:39.407
ARE YOU... LIVING

11:35.778 --> 11:39.407
IN... YOUR OFFICE?

11:39.449 --> 11:43.828
I AM. MR. PASTOR JIN AND I

11:39.449 --> 11:43.828
HAVE HAD A PARTING OF THE WAYS.

11:43.870 --> 11:44.996
I AM SO SORRY.

11:45.038 --> 11:48.542
I AM, TOO. THE MARRIAGE

11:45.038 --> 11:48.542
ENDED BECAUSE OF ME,

11:48.583 --> 11:50.210
BECAUSE OF OMISSION.

11:50.251 --> 11:53.754
EVERY TIME MY HUSBAND

11:50.251 --> 11:53.754
ASKED ME WHERE I'D BEEN,

11:53.796 --> 11:55.423
AND I SIMPLY SAID "OUT"

11:55.465 --> 11:57.551
INSTEAD OF

11:55.465 --> 11:57.551
"OUT WITH RICK WILKINS,

11:57.592 --> 11:59.802
THE MAN THAT MAKE ME

11:57.592 --> 11:59.802
FEEL ALIVE AGAIN,"

11:59.844 --> 12:02.847
I WAS LYING.

11:59.844 --> 12:02.847
I SEE THAT NOW.

12:02.889 --> 12:04.932
TELL THE TRUTH

12:02.889 --> 12:04.932
TO THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE,

12:04.974 --> 12:06.767
OR YOU WILL LOSE THEM.

12:06.809 --> 12:09.812
SO... SHOULD I TELL JAMES

12:06.809 --> 12:09.812
THE TRUTH NOW,

12:09.854 --> 12:11.272
OR SHOULD I WAIT?

12:09.854 --> 12:11.272
'CAUSE IT'S KIND OF LIKE

12:11.314 --> 12:13.774
WHEN YOU BORROW SOMEONE'S CAR

12:11.314 --> 12:13.774
AND YOU ACCIDENTALLY

12:13.816 --> 12:15.235
SPILL COFFEE DOWN THE GEARSHIFT

12:13.816 --> 12:15.235
AND YOU DON'T REALLY WANNA

12:15.276 --> 12:16.819
TELL THEM BECAUSE THEY

12:15.276 --> 12:16.819
JUST HAD SURGERY--

12:16.861 --> 12:19.573
OKAY, I DON'T HAVE TIME

12:16.861 --> 12:19.573
FOR METAPHORS, JUNE.

12:19.614 --> 12:22.701
I CHEATED ON MY HUSBAND,

12:19.614 --> 12:22.701
OKAY? AHH!

12:23.993 --> 12:26.663
(sighs)

12:23.993 --> 12:26.663
OKAY, TELL THE TRUTH.

12:26.705 --> 12:28.582
BETTER TO START SMALL.

12:28.623 --> 12:29.957
(chimes)

12:29.999 --> 12:30.875
June.

12:30.917 --> 12:33.169
MOM, I HAVE A CONFESSION

12:30.917 --> 12:33.169
TO MAKE.

12:33.211 --> 12:34.837
I HAD THE OLIVE OIL TASTING

12:33.211 --> 12:34.837
WITHOUT YOU.

12:34.879 --> 12:37.382
IT WAS SPRUNG ON ME.

12:34.879 --> 12:37.382
I'M SO SORRY.

12:37.424 --> 12:38.799
Okay.

12:38.841 --> 12:40.843
WOW. THAT WASN'T SO BAD.

12:40.885 --> 12:43.054
THE NEXT CALL I HAVE TO MAKE

12:40.885 --> 12:43.054
IS MUCH HARDER.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.805
SEE, I HAD

12:43.096 --> 12:44.805
THE OLIVE OIL TASTING

12:44.847 --> 12:46.266
AT JAMES VAN DER BEEK'S PLACE.

12:46.307 --> 12:47.808
CHLOE IS SUBLETTING IT OUT

12:46.307 --> 12:47.808
TO STRANGERS

12:47.850 --> 12:49.477
WHILE JAMES IS

12:47.850 --> 12:49.477
IN LOS ANGELES, AND--

12:49.519 --> 12:52.855
June, what--what the hell?

12:49.519 --> 12:52.855
My place is being sublet?

12:52.897 --> 12:55.816
JAMES? WH-WHAT ARE YOU

12:52.897 --> 12:55.816
DOING IN INDIANA?

12:55.858 --> 12:57.277
Indiana? I'm not in Indiana.

12:57.318 --> 13:00.321
YOUR MOM'S IN LOS ANGELES.

13:00.363 --> 13:01.364
WHAT?!

13:00.363 --> 13:01.364
(door slams)

13:07.370 --> 13:08.829
I'M SO SORRY, HONEY.

13:08.871 --> 13:10.998
JAMES ASKED ME TO COME

13:08.871 --> 13:10.998
BE IN THE LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE,

13:11.040 --> 13:13.627
AND YOU KNOW HOW HARD

13:11.040 --> 13:13.627
WE WORKED ON THIS--

13:13.668 --> 13:14.753
BUT YOU LIED TO ME!

13:14.793 --> 13:16.837
PARENTS LIE TO THEIR CHILDREN

13:14.793 --> 13:16.837
ALL THE TIME.

13:16.879 --> 13:19.840
SO THAT STUFF ABOUT BEING

13:16.879 --> 13:19.840
DESCENDANTS OF HONEST ABE?

13:19.882 --> 13:21.884
YOU HAD TO WRITE A SCHOOL PAPER.

13:21.926 --> 13:23.678
I WANTED TO MAKE IT

13:21.926 --> 13:23.678
SOUND INTERESTING.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.096
WHAT ELSE WAS A LIE?

13:26.180 --> 13:29.434
RUFF RUFF WENT TO GO LIVE

13:26.180 --> 13:29.434
ON A FARM.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.436
GRANDMA WOULD HAVE WANTED ME

13:29.476 --> 13:31.436
TO HAVE HER RINGS

13:31.478 --> 13:32.853
IF SHE WERE LUCID.

13:32.895 --> 13:34.897
MOMMY AND DADDY WERE

13:32.895 --> 13:34.897
IN THE SAME SLEEPING BAG

13:34.939 --> 13:37.651
BECAUSE IT WAS COLD.

13:37.692 --> 13:41.571
MOMMY'S HEAD WAS BY DADDY'S FEET

13:37.692 --> 13:41.571
BECAUSE HE HAD A SPLINTER.

13:41.613 --> 13:45.866
EW.

13:41.613 --> 13:45.866
MRS. COLBURN, I'M SO RELIEVED

13:41.613 --> 13:45.866
TO HEAR YOU'RE A NORMAL PERSON

13:45.908 --> 13:48.077
INSTEAD OF SOME WEIRD

13:45.908 --> 13:48.077
HONESTY FREAK.

13:48.119 --> 13:49.537
James, I know

13:49.579 --> 13:51.247
YOU'RE PROBABLY MAD

13:49.579 --> 13:51.247
THAT I SUBLET YOUR PLACE.

13:51.289 --> 13:53.874
"PROBABLY"?

13:51.289 --> 13:53.874
BUT I WAS GOING TO USE

13:51.289 --> 13:53.874
THE MONEY

13:53.916 --> 13:55.876
TO FLY OUT THERE

13:53.916 --> 13:55.876
AND SEE YOU PERFORM.

13:55.918 --> 13:59.339
AND? WHAT HAPPENED

13:55.918 --> 13:59.339
WITH THAT?

13:59.380 --> 14:02.175
WHAT DID HAPPEN WITH THAT?

14:02.216 --> 14:05.261
TAKE THAT ANGER AND CHANNEL IT

14:02.216 --> 14:05.261
TOWARDS YOUR DANCE.

14:05.303 --> 14:08.055
COME ON. LET'S GET YOU

14:05.303 --> 14:08.055
INTO YOUR COSTUME.

14:08.097 --> 14:09.890
JUNE, HONEY, I AM SO SORRY.

14:09.932 --> 14:13.102
I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO HELP JAMES

14:09.932 --> 14:13.102
WITH THIS BOMB YOU DROPPED.

14:13.144 --> 14:14.895
ALL THE LIES ALL THIS TIME?

14:14.937 --> 14:17.064
I'll call you later,

14:14.937 --> 14:17.064
and we will talk this all out.

14:17.106 --> 14:19.818
WAIT. WHATEVER HAPPENED

14:17.106 --> 14:19.818
TO RUFF RUFF?

14:19.859 --> 14:20.777
We left

14:19.859 --> 14:20.777
the garage door open,

14:20.819 --> 14:22.487
and your father

14:20.819 --> 14:22.487
backed over him.

14:22.529 --> 14:25.906
(gasps)

14:22.529 --> 14:25.906
He's buried under the arbor.

14:22.529 --> 14:25.906
We'll talk it all out later!

14:25.948 --> 14:26.907
(singsongy) Bye!

14:26.949 --> 14:27.908
(June) MOM WAS LYING

14:26.949 --> 14:27.908
TO ME,

14:27.950 --> 14:29.369
MY DAD RAN OVER

14:27.950 --> 14:29.369
MY DOG--

14:29.410 --> 14:31.621
SO MUCH FOR

14:29.410 --> 14:31.621
THE HONEST COLBURNS.

14:31.663 --> 14:34.957
(salsa music playing)

14:34.999 --> 14:37.377
GOD, I MEAN,

14:34.999 --> 14:37.377
I'M NERVOUS ENOUGH AS IT IS,

14:37.418 --> 14:39.713
AND NOW CHLOE HAS STRANGERS

14:37.418 --> 14:39.713
STAYING IN MY PLACE.

14:39.754 --> 14:43.174
I NEED TO GET HOME.

14:39.754 --> 14:43.174
(stammers) THOSE ARE JUST

14:39.754 --> 14:43.174
THINGS, JAMES.

14:43.216 --> 14:46.010
RIGHT NOW YOU ARE HERE

14:43.216 --> 14:46.010
WITH PEOPLE WHO LOVE YOU

14:46.052 --> 14:48.929
AND MILLIONS OF AMERICANS

14:46.052 --> 14:48.929
WHO ARE ROOTING FOR YOU

14:48.971 --> 14:50.973
TO KILL THE CHA-CHA TONIGHT.

14:51.015 --> 14:52.392
THAT IS WHAT MATTERS, JAMES.

14:52.433 --> 14:55.019
THINGS DON'T MATTER.

14:52.433 --> 14:55.019
PEOPLE MATTER.

14:55.061 --> 14:58.147
NO, THINGS MATTER. I-I--

14:55.061 --> 14:58.147
WHY DID I TAKE MY PEOPLE

14:58.189 --> 14:59.940
AND LEAVE MY THINGS?

14:58.189 --> 14:59.940
I SHOULD'VE TAKEN MY THINGS!

14:59.982 --> 15:00.941
I NEED TO BE WITH MY THINGS!

15:00.983 --> 15:03.027
OKAY, WHAT YOU NEED TO DO

15:00.983 --> 15:03.027
IS CALM DOWN!

15:03.069 --> 15:04.945
I CAN'T CALM DOWN!

15:03.069 --> 15:04.945
ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT

15:04.987 --> 15:08.533
ARE LOOSE MIDWESTERN HAIRS...

15:04.987 --> 15:08.533
(whispers) IN MY SHOWER.

15:08.575 --> 15:09.950
JAMES!

15:09.992 --> 15:11.952
SIT DOWN. I MADE YOU

15:09.992 --> 15:11.952
A NICE CUP OF TEA.

15:11.994 --> 15:13.872
AND JUST GET YOUR HEAD RIGHT.

15:16.708 --> 15:19.168
(slurps)

15:24.006 --> 15:25.007
MOMS ALWAYS KNOW

15:24.006 --> 15:25.007
WHAT TO DO.

15:25.049 --> 15:27.844
IT'S SOMETHING I PICKED UP

15:25.049 --> 15:27.844
IN CHINATOWN.

15:27.886 --> 15:30.555
WARM TEA IS LIKE A HUG

15:27.886 --> 15:30.555
FOR YOUR INSIDES.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.056
(dish clatters)

15:32.098 --> 15:33.683
HOW ABOUT A HUG

15:32.098 --> 15:33.683
FOR MY OUTSIDES?

15:33.725 --> 15:35.351
(laughs)

15:35.393 --> 15:39.606
YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG.

15:35.393 --> 15:39.606
ARMS GO UNDER HIS LIKE THAT.

15:39.647 --> 15:41.107
THERE YOU GO, BABY.

15:42.191 --> 15:44.151
(siren wailing in distance)

15:44.193 --> 15:45.779
(June) I HAD IT

15:44.193 --> 15:45.779
WITH HONESTY.

15:45.820 --> 15:48.364
I'M GONNA START LYING

15:45.820 --> 15:48.364
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

15:48.406 --> 15:50.991
I APPRECIATE THE FACT

15:48.406 --> 15:50.991
THAT YOU NEED A DONATION,

15:51.033 --> 15:53.494
AND I WOULD LOVE TO GIVE

15:51.033 --> 15:53.494
TO SAVE THE CHILDREN,

15:53.536 --> 15:55.079
BUT I HAVE

15:53.536 --> 15:55.079
SEVEN CHILDREN OF MY OWN,

15:55.121 --> 15:57.081
AND I'M MORBIDLY OBESE

15:55.121 --> 15:57.081
AND UNABLE TO WORK.

15:57.123 --> 16:02.002
TYLER! STOP HITTING YOUR SISTER

15:57.123 --> 16:02.002
AND GO GET ME A SNACK PIE!

16:02.044 --> 16:05.047
HI, NANCY. I CAN'T COME

16:02.044 --> 16:05.047
TO OUR SIXTH GRADE REUNION

16:05.089 --> 16:06.800
BECAUSE I'M LIVING IN FRANCE.

16:06.841 --> 16:09.051
I BROKE UP

16:06.841 --> 16:09.051
JOHNNY DEPP'S RELATIONSHIP.

16:09.093 --> 16:11.805
IT'S OKAY. I JUST CAN'T BE

16:09.093 --> 16:11.805
IN THE  CHOCOLATERIE

16:11.846 --> 16:14.098
AT THE SAME TIME AS HIS EX,

16:11.846 --> 16:14.098
VANESSA, BUT IT'S COOL.

16:14.140 --> 16:17.017
TYLER! THAT PIE!

16:17.059 --> 16:19.646
AS AN NYC WHISKEY INSPECTOR,

16:19.687 --> 16:22.440
I WILL NEED TO TRY ALL

16:19.687 --> 16:22.440
OF YOUR WHISKEYS FREE OF CHARGE.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.024
IF YOU COULD JUST START

16:22.482 --> 16:24.024
FROM YOUR FINEST

16:24.066 --> 16:26.486
AND WORK YOUR WAY BACK,

16:24.066 --> 16:26.486
THAT'D BE GREAT. THANK YOU.

16:26.527 --> 16:29.196
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:26.527 --> 16:29.196
I'M LYING, LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

16:29.238 --> 16:31.073
I TOLD THAT BOOTH

16:29.238 --> 16:31.073
OVER THERE

16:31.115 --> 16:32.450
THAT I WAS THE CHEF HERE,

16:32.492 --> 16:34.076
AND THEN I CAN'T REMEMBER

16:32.492 --> 16:34.076
WHO IT WAS

16:34.118 --> 16:36.245
BUT I TOLD SOMEONE IN HERE

16:34.118 --> 16:36.245
THAT I'M A SURGEON.

16:36.287 --> 16:37.956
AND THEN THOSE HOT GUYS

16:36.287 --> 16:37.956
OVER THERE,

16:37.997 --> 16:39.290
I TOLD THEM

16:37.997 --> 16:39.290
THAT I WAS A JOURNALIST

16:39.332 --> 16:42.042
DOING A STORY ON SEXY.

16:42.084 --> 16:43.043
THAT'LL PAY OFF LATER.

16:43.085 --> 16:46.046
THIS BAR IS A TEAT,

16:43.085 --> 16:46.046
AND I'M MILKING IT.

16:46.088 --> 16:48.048
OKAY,

16:46.088 --> 16:48.048
HERE'S OUR FIRST WHISKEY.

16:48.090 --> 16:50.092
IT'S A SINGLE BARREL

16:48.090 --> 16:50.092
FROM SCOTLAND.

16:50.134 --> 16:52.011
LET'S SEE. OKAY.

16:53.137 --> 16:55.723
THERE'S DEFINITELY

16:53.137 --> 16:55.723
A HINT OF SMOKE.

16:55.765 --> 16:57.475
IT'S ICED TEA.

16:55.765 --> 16:57.475
YOU'RE A TERRIBLE LIAR.

16:57.517 --> 16:58.893
THAT'LL BE $16.

16:58.935 --> 17:00.227
FOR ICED TEA?!

17:00.269 --> 17:01.980
I AM NOT

17:00.269 --> 17:01.980
A TERRIBLE LIAR.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.314
I INHERITED IT FROM MY MOTHER,

17:03.356 --> 17:05.274
AND SHE'S ACTUALLY

17:03.356 --> 17:05.274
REALLY GOOD AT IT.

17:05.316 --> 17:07.067
STOP. WHAT YOUR MOTHER

17:05.316 --> 17:07.067
WAS DOING

17:07.109 --> 17:09.069
HAD NOTHING TO DO

17:07.109 --> 17:09.069
WITH BAR LIES.

17:09.111 --> 17:12.782
BAR LIES ARE SUPPOSED

17:09.111 --> 17:12.782
TO BE FUN AND FLIRTY.

17:12.824 --> 17:15.493
WHAT YOUR MOM WAS DOING

17:12.824 --> 17:15.493
WAS A TOTAL BETRAYAL OF TRUST.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.161
YOU KNOW WHAT,

17:15.535 --> 17:17.161
YOU'RE JUST MAKING EXCUSES.

17:17.203 --> 17:19.747
IT'S ALL ONE BIG

17:17.203 --> 17:19.747
SWEATY BALL OF LIES.

17:19.789 --> 17:21.081
NO, IT'S NOT.

17:21.123 --> 17:22.583
IT'S DIFFERENT

17:21.123 --> 17:22.583
WHEN YOU LIE TO STRANGERS

17:22.625 --> 17:24.585

17:24.627 --> 17:26.880
OH, YOU MEAN LIKE HOW

17:24.627 --> 17:26.880
YOU LIE TO YOUR FRIEND JAMES

17:26.921 --> 17:30.049
AND RENT OUT HIS APARTMENT

17:26.921 --> 17:30.049
EVERY TIME HE GOES OUT OF TOWN?

17:31.133 --> 17:34.554
WELL, HE DID ASK YOU

17:31.133 --> 17:34.554
TO PAY YOLANDA.

17:34.595 --> 17:37.097
BY NOT ASKING ME, HE'S SAYING

17:34.595 --> 17:37.097
THAT I CAN'T BE TRUSTED

17:37.139 --> 17:39.934
WHICH IS PRACTICALLY GIVING ME

17:37.139 --> 17:39.934
PERMISSION TO RENT IT OUT.

17:39.976 --> 17:41.101
HE BEGGED ME TO DO IT.

17:41.143 --> 17:43.103
CRAP! I FORGOT

17:41.143 --> 17:43.103
TO PAY YOLANDA.

17:43.145 --> 17:44.981
SO WE BOTH SCREWED JAMES.

17:45.023 --> 17:47.107
AHA! SO YOU DO ADMIT

17:45.023 --> 17:47.107
THAT YOU SCREWED HIM.

17:47.149 --> 17:48.108

18:01.163 --> 18:03.123
YOU LIE TO NO ONE.

18:03.165 --> 18:05.167
I LIE ONLY TO STRANGERS
