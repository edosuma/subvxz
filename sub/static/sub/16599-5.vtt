08:51.231 --> 08:52.531
Yeah, we know what
this thing was about yet?

08:52.533 --> 08:53.832
No, but I did speak to Johnny K,

08:53.834 --> 08:55.300
the guy who owns the gun range,
and he said

08:55.302 --> 08:57.135
he couldn't think of any
disgruntled employees

08:57.136 --> 08:58.969
or customers that would have
done something like this.

08:58.972 --> 09:01.973
Yet, some maniac with
a bulldozer does what he does.

09:01.975 --> 09:03.975
I think that
there was probably a reason.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.644
Hey. CHIN: So I just spoke

09:05.646 --> 09:07.012
with some of the customers
at the gun range

09:07.014 --> 09:08.313
who were there
when the whole thing went down.

09:08.315 --> 09:10.248
Anybody get eyes on the perp?

09:10.249 --> 09:12.182
No, but they did tell me
something interesting. Come on.

09:12.185 --> 09:13.852
JOHNNY K:
<i> I already gave</i>

09:13.854 --> 09:15.120
my statement. I don't know
what this is about.

09:15.122 --> 09:17.022
Well, we think something
might have been stolen.

09:17.024 --> 09:19.157
Like what? Cash? Ammo? No.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.725
HPD said they checked.
Looked like

09:20.727 --> 09:22.627
everything was right where
it's supposed to be.

09:22.629 --> 09:24.596
STEVE: Yeah, except we spoke to some
of your regulars, and they told us

09:24.598 --> 09:26.932
for 80 bucks,
they could fire Uzis,

09:26.934 --> 09:28.934
MP-5s, some other fun stuff.

09:28.936 --> 09:31.803
But for $400 cash, you'd take
them downstairs to the basement,

09:31.805 --> 09:34.205
let 'em fire something
really special.

09:34.207 --> 09:37.208
Thing is, HPD went down there,
they didn't find any hardware.

09:37.210 --> 09:39.678
So, what, uh... what'd you keep
in the basement, Johnny?

09:39.680 --> 09:41.046
CHIN: <i> This is what</i>
<i> our perp was after--</i>

09:41.048 --> 09:43.048
Johnny K's secret stash.

09:43.050 --> 09:45.283
A small arsenal
of very expensive weapons,

09:45.285 --> 09:49.020
many of which are illegal to
possess in the state of Hawaii.

09:49.022 --> 09:51.756
So this bird jacks a bulldozer
from a construction site,

09:51.758 --> 09:53.024
and he tricks it out

09:53.026 --> 09:55.794
into some kind
of bullet-proof battering ram,

09:55.796 --> 09:57.295
knocks down the wall
of the place,

09:57.297 --> 09:58.830
during business hours,

09:58.832 --> 10:01.166
when he's pretty sure
the vault's gonna be open.

10:01.168 --> 10:04.202
Right. Then employees
and customers scatter.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.704
Our guy goes in there,

10:05.705 --> 10:07.205
takes at least half-a-million
dollars worth of iron.

10:07.207 --> 10:08.773
GROVER: Right, but how's
he gonna move it?

10:08.775 --> 10:10.842
Criminals like weapons
that are cheap and untraceable.

10:10.844 --> 10:13.078
These are neither.
That's right.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.146
And if this guy's smart,
which he certainly seems to be,

10:15.148 --> 10:16.648
he's gonna take
these weapons straight

10:16.650 --> 10:18.216
to the collectors' market,
which is why I just got

10:18.218 --> 10:20.051
off the phone from Norm,
our old buddy

10:20.053 --> 10:21.386
from Norm's
Sportsman's Shop.

10:21.388 --> 10:22.320
This guy

10:22.322 --> 10:24.055

10:27.661 --> 10:29.327
I wouldn't say
"gun aficionados"

10:29.329 --> 10:31.062
'cause an aficionado,
to me, refers to, like,

10:31.064 --> 10:34.099
people who collect cars,
and cigars and fine wine.

10:34.101 --> 10:35.300
Gun nuts are gun nuts.
Let's call them what they are.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.002
They're gun nuts.
That's being nice.

10:37.004 --> 10:38.670
Okay, all right.

10:38.671 --> 10:40.337
And now that you're the arbiter
of fine living?

10:40.340 --> 10:41.406
Is that,
is that right?

10:41.408 --> 10:42.674
Hey, whatever.

10:42.676 --> 10:44.009
I respectfully disagree.

10:44.011 --> 10:45.076
Okay?
GROVER: So, Norm.

10:45.078 --> 10:45.977
STEVE:
Mm-hmm.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.646
He give you any names

10:47.648 --> 10:49.214
that maybe we should
get in contact with?

10:49.216 --> 10:50.782
He did.
He gave me a name.

10:50.784 --> 10:51.750
This guy.

10:51.752 --> 10:55.387

11:01.662 --> 11:03.412
This guy is

11:03.413 --> 11:05.163
a gun enthusiast/social
media personality.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.298
GROVER: <i> He's got over

11:09.302 --> 11:10.301
Yeah, it looks like

11:10.303 --> 11:11.703
Mr. McConnell's got a past.

11:11.705 --> 11:12.671
He was linked

11:13.840 --> 11:14.973

11:14.975 --> 11:16.425
<i> Right, according to Norm,</i>

11:16.426 --> 11:17.876
this guy moved out
to the islands a few years ago

11:17.878 --> 11:20.111
to "reinvent himself"
as a lifestyle mogul.

11:20.113 --> 11:23.381
He claims to own over 100
firearms, but Norm says

11:23.383 --> 11:26.084
there is one weapon
that Matty

11:26.086 --> 11:29.087
does not own.
And that he

11:29.089 --> 11:31.122
is apparently
obsessed with:

11:31.124 --> 11:33.858
one of the guns stolen
from Johnny K's vault.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.860
M134 Minigun.

11:35.862 --> 11:37.429
Oh, well, he does have
expensive taste.

11:37.431 --> 11:39.998
Get one of those, it'll set
you back at least $150K.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.800
Well, if those pictures
in his FlicPhoto account

11:41.802 --> 11:44.369
are any indication,
I think he can afford it.

11:44.371 --> 11:47.072
Right. Now we just got to see

Louis Kalama.

12:32.119 --> 12:34.018
He hasn't heard from her
in years,

12:34.020 --> 12:36.187
and he's pretty broken up
about it.

12:36.189 --> 12:39.057
I'd like to track her
down for him.

12:42.763 --> 12:43.795

I'd like
to repay the favor.

13:07.154 --> 13:09.187
Okay.

13:13.026 --> 13:15.260
Well, records show
there's no Emily Kalama

13:15.262 --> 13:16.494
currently living in Hawaii,

13:16.496 --> 13:18.329
or on the mainland.

13:18.331 --> 13:20.932

have just vanished.

13:26.306 --> 13:29.007
there was an Emily Kalama
living in Manoa Valley.

13:29.009 --> 13:30.975
But then she disappears.

13:30.977 --> 13:33.311
But there was
an Emily Kingston

13:33.313 --> 13:36.548
living at the same address
for a few months after that.

13:36.550 --> 13:38.883
She changed her last name.

13:38.885 --> 13:42.954
As soon as she turned 18,

Be careful what you wish for.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.664
Hi. CHIN: Hey. Just in time.

15:32.666 --> 15:35.934
This photo was uploaded
to Matty McConnell's FlicPhoto

15:35.936 --> 15:38.469
account for his 12 million
followers to see.

15:38.471 --> 15:40.038
Okay, but CSU never found

15:40.040 --> 15:41.439
McConnell's phone
at the scene.

15:41.441 --> 15:42.974
We're thinking that the killer
must have swiped it

15:42.976 --> 15:44.309
to access his social media.

15:44.311 --> 15:45.410
He definitely
turned off the phone

15:45.412 --> 15:46.878
after he uploaded
this photo,

15:46.879 --> 15:48.345
so we just pinged his phone
and got nothing.

15:48.348 --> 15:49.514
But we do have
a couple of leads.

15:49.516 --> 15:51.149
For starters, our
guy got careless,

15:51.151 --> 15:52.951
managed to get himself
into the shot.

15:52.953 --> 15:54.419
Unfortunately, it's not enough
for facial rec,

15:54.421 --> 15:56.120
but he may have revealed
his true intentions

15:56.122 --> 15:58.723
with the rest of the post.
Check out this caption.

15:58.725 --> 16:01.192
GROVER (reading): "This is
what real karma looks like.

16:01.194 --> 16:03.328
It's time for real gun control."

16:03.330 --> 16:04.629
Mm-hmm. And
there's a link.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.597
DANNY:
An anti-gun forum.

16:06.599 --> 16:08.132
Okay. So this guy,
he levels a gun range.

16:08.134 --> 16:09.300
Then he executes a man

16:09.302 --> 16:11.235
who made a living
glorifying firearms,

16:11.237 --> 16:12.670
then he hijacks
his social media

16:12.672 --> 16:15.139
to promote an
anti-gun agenda?

16:15.141 --> 16:16.541
We're not looking
for a normal killer here.

16:16.543 --> 16:18.042
This guy's a vigilante,

16:18.044 --> 16:19.377
and he's declaring
a war on guns.

16:19.379 --> 16:21.329
Which means

16:21.330 --> 16:23.280
that anyone who is pro-guns
could be his next target.

16:23.283 --> 16:26.150
WOMAN:
I told her to break up with him.

16:26.152 --> 16:28.119
I begged her to get
a restraining order.

16:28.121 --> 16:32.156
But when she finally did,
it didn't matter.

16:32.158 --> 16:36.194
He went out...
got a gun...

16:36.196 --> 16:38.162

and shot her

16:38.164 --> 16:40.598

Thank you, Cynthia,

16:42.035 --> 16:43.568

16:43.570 --> 16:45.670
I know it was difficult.

16:47.273 --> 16:51.542

and then continue.

16:51.544 --> 16:53.177
<i> How can I help you, gentlemen?</i>

16:53.179 --> 16:55.113
We assume you heard about the
incident that happened

16:55.115 --> 16:57.281
at the gun club on Kalakaua
this morning,

16:57.283 --> 16:58.716
and the murder of
Matty McConnell.

16:58.718 --> 17:00.318
Yeah. It's all over the news.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.487
Right. Well, uh,
we were thinking

17:02.489 --> 17:04.389
that maybe whoever
was responsible,

17:04.391 --> 17:06.724
perhaps they could have been
a victim of gun violence,

17:06.726 --> 17:08.459
or maybe lost somebody
who was close to them

17:08.461 --> 17:10.261
that would explain
the motivation.

17:10.263 --> 17:12.196
Okay.

17:12.198 --> 17:13.765
Well, what does this have to do
with me?

17:13.767 --> 17:15.066
Okay.
Uh, what about this guy?

17:15.068 --> 17:17.535
We believe he
may be involved.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.270
You recognize him?

17:19.272 --> 17:21.506
(clicks tongue)
DANNY: That's a yes.

17:21.508 --> 17:23.474
That looks like Marvin.

17:23.476 --> 17:25.309
He only came in
a few times.

17:25.311 --> 17:27.245
He didn't say much,
he just listened.

17:27.247 --> 17:28.730
The only thing

17:28.731 --> 17:30.214
I could get out of him
is that he lost a family member,

17:30.216 --> 17:31.582
and he moved out here
from the mainland

17:31.584 --> 17:33.151
a year after it happened.

17:33.153 --> 17:35.820
Said he wanted to get
as far away as he could.

17:35.822 --> 17:37.488
You, uh, know Marvin's
last name?

17:37.490 --> 17:39.490
No. But we do ask new people

17:39.492 --> 17:41.559
to leave their contact info
on a registration card.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.162
Let's check it out.

17:45.432 --> 17:47.498
(phone ringing)

17:47.500 --> 17:49.067
Hey, Lou.
What's up?

17:49.069 --> 17:51.169
I ran that name you gave me.

17:51.170 --> 17:53.270
There's no record of anybody
named Marvin Osweiler.

17:53.273 --> 17:54.772
So he gave him a fake name;
that's interesting.

17:54.774 --> 17:57.508
Well, the name may be fake,
but the address is legit.

17:57.510 --> 17:59.277
I'm uploading it
to your GPS right now.

17:59.279 --> 18:01.345
All right, got it.
Thank you. Hey, Lou,

18:01.347 --> 18:03.648
have HPD set a perimeter,
and have Chin Ho meet us there.

18:03.650 --> 18:05.550
Way ahead of you, buddy.
Where are we at

18:05.552 --> 18:07.552
with the protection detail
for the other potential targets?

18:07.554 --> 18:08.820
Well, HPD's already reached out

18:08.822 --> 18:11.122
to the obvious ones,
your gun dealers,

18:11.124 --> 18:13.558
your heads of gun rights
associations, and the like.

18:13.560 --> 18:15.460
The problem is most of them
said, "No thanks."

18:15.462 --> 18:19.097
Their attitude is our guns are
all the protection we need.

18:19.099 --> 18:21.866
That's great.
That's-- it's good judgment.

18:21.868 --> 18:23.601
I'm-I'm glad that those people
are armed.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.736
It makes me feel good.
Yeah, Duke's afraid

18:25.738 --> 18:27.405
that most of these people
actually want Marvin

18:27.407 --> 18:28.639
to come after them.

18:28.641 --> 18:30.174
STEVE: Yeah. All right.
Well, let's hope

18:30.176 --> 18:31.809
it doesn't come to that.
Thanks, Lou.

18:31.811 --> 18:34.479
Really the height of hypocrisy,
isn't it?

18:34.481 --> 18:36.314
What is the
height of hypocrisy?

18:36.316 --> 18:40.284
Well, this guy is using a gun
to go on an anti-gun crusade.

18:40.286 --> 18:41.569
Hmm.

18:41.570 --> 18:42.853
I mean, how else is he gonna
make his point, I guess?

18:42.856 --> 18:44.489
I think what
we should do,

18:44.491 --> 18:45.756
get a big magnet,

18:45.758 --> 18:47.325
Mm-hmm.

18:47.326 --> 18:48.893
glue it to the bottom
of a helicopter,

18:48.895 --> 18:49.894
fly all around the country,

18:49.896 --> 18:51.429
and suck up all the guns, huh?

18:51.431 --> 18:53.631
That's good, right?

18:53.633 --> 18:54.765
Yeah, it's good.

18:54.767 --> 18:55.867
Sucks 'em all up.

18:55.869 --> 18:57.318
Why? What are you laughing at?

18:57.319 --> 18:58.768
Well, I can see what you're
doing is what I'm laughing at.

18:58.771 --> 19:00.221
What am I doing?

19:00.222 --> 19:01.672
You're trying to bait me;
it's not gonna work.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.508
'Cause you know that I believe

19:03.510 --> 19:04.909
that if they're handled
correctly,

19:04.911 --> 19:06.511
it's perfectly okay
to have guns.

19:06.513 --> 19:07.645
Yeah, I don't...
See, I don't think you think

19:07.647 --> 19:09.280
that they're perfectly okay.

19:09.281 --> 19:10.914
Guns-- they're not just okay to you.
Mm-hmm.

19:10.917 --> 19:12.316
You like guns.

19:12.318 --> 19:13.784
You, you love a good gun.

19:13.786 --> 19:15.386
You're a gun guy, you know. Hmm.

19:15.388 --> 19:17.688
I think you probably sleep
with your gun at night.

19:17.690 --> 19:18.890
You'd probably marry your gun.
That's...

19:18.892 --> 19:20.658
That's stupid.
Now you're being an idiot.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.527
And I'm gonna
ignore you, okay?

19:22.529 --> 19:24.395
I'm not saying anything that isn't true.
Oh, so you're saying,

19:24.397 --> 19:26.531
you're saying you don't believe
in the Second Amendment,

19:26.533 --> 19:28.166
but that people should have the
right to keep and bear arms.

19:28.168 --> 19:29.433
I'm not talking about
the Second Amendment, okay?

19:29.435 --> 19:30.635
That mentions a militia.

19:30.637 --> 19:32.837
Okay? It also uses words

19:32.839 --> 19:34.839
like "well-regulated",
and good job ignoring me.

19:34.841 --> 19:37.275
Okay, so you're saying people
shouldn't be able

19:37.276 --> 19:39.710
to carry guns despite the fact
that you carry a gun.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.812
I carry a gun-- I'm a cop.
It's my job to carry a gun.

19:41.814 --> 19:43.681
Mm-hmm.
What are you talking about?

19:43.682 --> 19:45.549
I got to, I got to protect
the good guys from the bad guys.

19:45.552 --> 19:46.817
Right. Exactly.

19:46.819 --> 19:48.319
So what if normal people,
what if citizens

19:48.321 --> 19:49.520
want to protect themselves

19:49.522 --> 19:50.721
and their families
from the bad guys?

19:50.723 --> 19:52.723
Shouldn't they have a right
to do that?

19:52.724 --> 19:54.724
How about if we just don't let
the bad guys have any guns?

19:54.727 --> 19:56.327
Then the good guys
won't need any guns,

19:56.329 --> 19:58.262
and nobody needs any guns,
how about that?

19:58.264 --> 19:59.864
And you know what else?
While we're at it,

19:59.866 --> 20:01.766
we can eliminate discrimination,
war, hatred, violence,

20:01.768 --> 20:02.900
all that kind of stuff.

20:02.902 --> 20:04.635
We'll all live
happily ever after,

20:04.637 --> 20:06.237
and we can, uh, you know,

20:06.239 --> 20:07.872
ride our unicorns
to work every day.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.840
And you'd probably commandeer
my unicorn,

20:09.842 --> 20:11.209
and drive it to work every day.
And guess what?

20:11.211 --> 20:13.244
If you had a gun,
you could stop me.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.291
You sure you don't want
me to come with you?

20:27.293 --> 20:29.293
I don't want her to feel
like she's being ganged up on.

20:29.295 --> 20:30.695
(seatbelt clicks)

20:30.697 --> 20:32.330
Just give me
a few minutes.

20:32.332 --> 20:34.632
All right.

20:51.517 --> 20:52.717
Yes?

20:52.719 --> 20:54.752
Emily Kingston.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.754
That's right.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.756
My name
is Adam Noshimuri.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.758
I'm a friend of your father.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.027
I'm sorry,
I don't have a father.

21:04.697 --> 21:06.897
Hey, can I come inside
for a second?

21:06.899 --> 21:09.500
No, I don't... I don't think
that's a good idea.

21:09.502 --> 21:11.602
I know things weren't great
between you two,

21:11.604 --> 21:15.406
but I also know he'd really
like to see you. Well,

21:15.408 --> 21:18.609
I don't want to see him, so
I'm sorry you wasted your time.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.778
Emily, wait.

21:21.748 --> 21:24.548
Louis has cancer.

21:24.550 --> 21:26.817

21:29.522 --> 21:32.490
He put you up to this, didn't he?
No.

21:32.492 --> 21:34.825
No, he doesn't
even know I'm here.

21:34.827 --> 21:37.361
Really? Then why are you here?

21:37.363 --> 21:39.463
Because he had my back
in prison.

21:39.465 --> 21:43.034
He saved my life,
more than once.

21:43.036 --> 21:45.936
Well, that's great
that he saved your life and all,

21:45.938 --> 21:49.073
but it doesn't make up for
all the lives that he ruined.

21:49.075 --> 21:51.575
And not just mine or my mom's.

21:51.577 --> 21:53.377
Louis was an addict.

21:53.379 --> 21:55.846
He was selfish,
and he let us down.

21:55.848 --> 21:57.415
I'm sure he did.

21:57.417 --> 21:59.417
Look... I didn't know him

21:59.419 --> 22:01.686
before he went inside.

22:01.688 --> 22:04.388
I'm sorry you had to.

22:04.390 --> 22:06.824
But the man I do know

22:06.826 --> 22:08.959
is a stand-up guy.

how to read.

so they don't

22:17.403 --> 22:19.603

bad decisions he did.

than the other
24 richest countries

30:16.048 --> 30:17.815
on this planet combined.

30:17.817 --> 30:20.150
And what has our government
done about that?

30:20.152 --> 30:21.835
They killed

30:21.836 --> 30:23.519
the assault weapons act...
(whispers): What are you doing?

30:23.522 --> 30:25.823
He's distracted.
I'm gonna end this.

30:25.825 --> 30:27.558
Please, don't.

30:27.559 --> 30:29.292
You're gonna get us all killed.
Got to do something,

30:29.295 --> 30:31.261
or this son of a bitch
is gonna kill us first.

30:31.263 --> 30:33.363
Just let the police handle it.
You don't need to do this.

30:33.365 --> 30:36.266
...more important to them
than protecting our chil...

30:36.268 --> 30:39.136
(gunshots, people screaming)

30:45.077 --> 30:47.177
KONO:
I got a pulse.

30:49.281 --> 30:50.848
I don't feel an exit wound.

30:50.850 --> 30:51.548
I think

30:51.550 --> 30:54.017
the bullet's still in him.

30:54.019 --> 30:55.085
You guys are cops, aren't you?

31:08.400 --> 31:09.132
Easy.

31:09.134 --> 31:10.367
Easy.

31:10.369 --> 31:11.935
I said no cops.

31:12.571 --> 31:13.604
He's gonna shoot them.

31:13.606 --> 31:15.439
Prepare to breach on my command.

31:19.945 --> 31:21.578
Get away from him.

31:21.580 --> 31:23.046
I need to apply
constant pressure.

31:23.048 --> 31:25.983
You, take over.
You two, back away.

31:31.090 --> 31:33.023
Toss your earpieces
on the ground towards me.

31:35.995 --> 31:36.894
Here.

31:36.896 --> 31:37.928
Put 'em on.

31:37.930 --> 31:39.162
Cinch 'em
with your teeth.

31:40.065 --> 31:41.198
Sit down.

31:44.270 --> 31:46.370
Hold on, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I don't think he's gonna shoot.

31:46.372 --> 31:47.537
I think you
might be right.

31:47.539 --> 31:48.906

31:48.908 --> 31:49.640

31:59.351 --> 32:01.084

32:01.086 --> 32:02.653

32:02.655 --> 32:04.388
I'm not done yet.

32:04.389 --> 32:06.122
Marvin, why don't you tell me
what's happening in there first?

32:06.125 --> 32:08.258
What's happening is
one of your judges just realized

32:08.260 --> 32:10.127
the answer to the gun problem

32:10.129 --> 32:12.195
sure ain't allowing
more people to carry.

32:12.197 --> 32:14.097
Let me come in and get him.

32:14.099 --> 32:15.999
I'll come in by myself.
He's gonna bleed out

32:16.001 --> 32:17.267
if he doesn't get
medical attention.

32:17.269 --> 32:18.468
Then let him bleed out!

32:19.305 --> 32:20.637
You tried to play me.

32:20.639 --> 32:22.973
You think you're gonna
get more hostages, huh?

32:22.975 --> 32:24.408
Turn the feed back on!

32:24.410 --> 32:26.376
You got one minute!

32:26.378 --> 32:28.679
Marvin? Marvin!

32:28.681 --> 32:31.048
He's losing it.

32:31.050 --> 32:32.416
We got to breach.

32:32.418 --> 32:34.151
This is not a good idea. Steve.

32:34.153 --> 32:35.485
Steve.
What's he doing now?

32:38.424 --> 32:41.124
DANNY: See? Look.
Now we can't see anything.

32:41.126 --> 32:43.160
He turned the camera off, so now
we're blind, so going in before

32:43.162 --> 32:45.429
was a bad idea--
now it's a<i> really</i> bad idea.

32:45.431 --> 32:47.597
You let me know
if he turns it back on.

32:52.371 --> 32:54.071
CHIN:
<i> Eric, what do you got?</i>

32:59.678 --> 33:01.378
What?
What? What is it? What?

33:01.380 --> 33:02.746
All right, thanks.

33:02.748 --> 33:05.415
Well, we got an I.D.

33:05.417 --> 33:07.751
Marvin's real name is Kyle Kane.

33:07.753 --> 33:09.619
His son was involved
in a mass shooting

33:09.621 --> 33:11.405
in Virginia two years ago.

33:11.406 --> 33:13.190
Some lunatic killed his son--
no wonder he snapped.

33:13.192 --> 33:14.992
No, Danny, that's not it.
His son wasn't a victim,

33:14.994 --> 33:17.627
he was the shooter.
His son was the shooter.

33:21.033 --> 33:22.099
Steve.

33:22.101 --> 33:23.918
The guy's son was bullied
Danny.

33:23.919 --> 33:25.736
in school, and he got ahold
of an assault rifle

33:25.738 --> 33:27.204
through a straw purchase

33:27.206 --> 33:28.672
and killed people in a mall.

33:28.674 --> 33:30.407
<i> Six were his classmates,</i>
<i> injured 12 others.</i>

33:30.409 --> 33:33.443
(woman screams) <i>According to
his police report,</i> <i> he was</i>

33:33.445 --> 33:35.345
a Matty McConnell fan.
Okay, so this guy blames

33:35.347 --> 33:36.680
the gun culture
and easy access

33:36.682 --> 33:39.016
to firearms for turning his kid
into a shooter.

33:39.018 --> 33:40.550
I got to get this guy
back on the phone, Steve,

33:40.552 --> 33:42.052
try to talk him down
or we got trouble.

33:42.054 --> 33:43.286
(sighs)
Do it.

33:43.288 --> 33:45.489

33:45.491 --> 33:47.524

right now.

This is
Detective Danny Williams.

33:49.695 --> 33:51.294
Where's Commander McGarrett?

33:51.296 --> 33:52.729
McGarrett is working on getting

33:52.731 --> 33:55.766
the TV people, uh,
to get you back up on the air.

33:55.768 --> 33:57.634
That's crap. You're stalling.

33:57.636 --> 34:00.337
Uh... I-I know who you are.

34:00.339 --> 34:02.706
Kyle Kane, Virginia.
Your son is Sean.

34:02.708 --> 34:05.542
I even know what your son did.

34:05.544 --> 34:07.778
Losing a son, uh,
him being responsible

34:07.780 --> 34:10.180
for what he did,
I-I can't imagine...

34:10.182 --> 34:12.215
I can't imagine
what that did to you.

34:12.217 --> 34:14.651
There's not a day goes by
I don't think about it.

34:14.653 --> 34:17.521
About where I went wrong.
I should have seen

34:17.523 --> 34:19.289
the signs of...

34:20.292 --> 34:22.392
I failed my son.

34:22.394 --> 34:25.262
And because of that,
now eight people are dead.

34:25.264 --> 34:26.396
DANNY:
Look, you are not responsible.

34:26.398 --> 34:28.698
This is not on you, Kyle.
You hear me?

34:28.700 --> 34:30.667
I failed him. I...

34:30.669 --> 34:32.536
I failed my son.

34:32.538 --> 34:34.271
Listen to me. I am a parent.

34:34.273 --> 34:35.672
I got two kids-- I got a son

34:35.674 --> 34:37.707
and I got a daughter--
and I know...

34:37.709 --> 34:40.811
I know no matter what I do, how
hard I try to raise them right,

34:40.813 --> 34:42.412
teach them
the right things to do,

34:42.414 --> 34:44.281
at the end of the day,
what they do,

34:44.283 --> 34:46.383
that I can't be responsible
for their actions.

34:46.385 --> 34:48.418
I mean, what-what your son
Sean did, he did on his own.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.320
There's nothing you
could have done to stop that.

34:50.322 --> 34:52.823
You don't know that.
I'm not the only one with blood

34:52.825 --> 34:55.826
on my hands--
the gunmakers, the lobbyists,

34:55.828 --> 34:57.627
politicians in their pockets--

34:57.629 --> 34:59.763
they're all responsible, too.

34:59.765 --> 35:01.331
(crying):
I thought after it happened

35:01.333 --> 35:02.866
that maybe something
would change,

35:02.868 --> 35:04.568
maybe-maybe some good

35:04.570 --> 35:06.269
would come out of it.

35:06.271 --> 35:09.272
But then nothing happened!

35:09.274 --> 35:12.275
That's when I knew
that something had to be done.

35:12.277 --> 35:16.146
Somebody had to hold
these gun nuts accountable.

35:16.148 --> 35:17.180
I understand that.

35:17.182 --> 35:19.349
And I know that it is very easy

35:19.351 --> 35:21.218
to blame
the pro-gun crowd.

35:21.220 --> 35:23.620
But I-I think, ultimately,
we are all responsible,

35:23.622 --> 35:25.889
collectively.

35:25.890 --> 35:28.157
The gun industry can stop it;
they choose not to!

35:28.160 --> 35:30.694
The gun industry
doesn't police itself.

35:30.696 --> 35:33.163
The politicians
don't do their jobs.

35:33.165 --> 35:35.565
And on it goes,
and on and on and on!

35:35.567 --> 35:37.334
It's got to end!

35:37.336 --> 35:40.137
I agree with you 100%, okay?
I am a cop.

35:40.139 --> 35:43.140
I am outraged
at how easy it is to get a gun,

35:43.142 --> 35:44.241
no questions asked.

35:44.243 --> 35:45.609
As a father,
I'm even more outraged.

35:45.611 --> 35:47.644
This is not the way
we fix the problem.

35:47.646 --> 35:49.312
Uh, stealing guns
and-and killing people?

35:49.314 --> 35:51.748
I mean, you're no different
than any other crazy man

35:51.750 --> 35:53.283
with a gun. Right?

35:53.285 --> 35:55.218
Look, I don't think
you want to hurt anybody else.

35:55.220 --> 35:56.686
That's not what
you were trying to do.

35:56.688 --> 35:58.004

35:58.005 --> 35:59.321

You said what you had to say.

35:59.324 --> 36:01.324
But somebody in there is hurt,
hurt pretty bad,

36:01.326 --> 36:03.527
and if he dies
or if anybody else gets hurt,

36:03.529 --> 36:05.495
