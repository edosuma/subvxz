00:02.530 --> 00:04.088
Previously on Elementary:
How much heroin is that?

00:04.130 --> 00:05.165
Oh, it's enough.

00:08.540 --> 00:10.303
MYCROl-â€˜l':
British intelligence
isn't here to arrest me.

00:10.340 --> 00:13.503
I am British intelligence.

00:13.540 --> 00:15.701
Tell me about Sudomo Han.
About three years ago,

00:15.740 --> 00:18.174
when Sherlock was
at the height of his drug use,

00:18.210 --> 00:20.314
Han approached him
to act as a sort of

00:20.350 --> 00:22.181
confidential courier.

00:22.220 --> 00:23.539
Sherlock took the job?

00:23.590 --> 00:26.058
Unfortunately,
what Sherlock didn't realize

00:26.090 --> 00:28.354
_ was that Han was
financmg a terrorist plot.

00:28.390 --> 00:31.188
In other words,
everything that you did for MI6

00:31.230 --> 00:32.697
was all to protect Sherlock.

00:32.730 --> 00:34.152
HOLMES:
Sherrington.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.189
You must be the handler.

00:35.230 --> 00:36.299
SHERRINGTON:
I have a case,

00:36.330 --> 00:38.195
I think you'd call it.

00:38.230 --> 00:39.629
HAWES:
Arthur Cadogan West.

00:39.670 --> 00:41.695
Two gunshots to the chest.

00:41.740 --> 00:43.708
HOLMES:
Arthur West thought

00:43.740 --> 00:45.298
there was a mole in M16.

00:45.340 --> 00:47.171
Whoever stole his arms
wanted these numbers.

00:47.210 --> 00:50.338
West thought they were proof
of the mole's existence.

00:50.380 --> 00:51.677
Work for us, Sherlock.

00:51.710 --> 00:53.348
Officially.

00:53.380 --> 00:55.473
Permanently.

00:55.520 --> 00:56.646
I'm moving out.

00:56.690 --> 00:58.180
Of?
The brownstone.

00:58.220 --> 01:00.211
I need to get my own place.
It's time.

01:02.160 --> 01:04.082
(gasps)
Good God, man.

01:04.130 --> 01:05.279
Sherlock,
what are you doing here?!

01:05.330 --> 01:07.218
It's quite simple:

01:07.260 --> 01:09.160
You're being framed...

01:09.200 --> 01:10.690
for murder and treason.

01:12.270 --> 01:14.158
MYCROFI':
Sherlock.

01:14.200 --> 01:15.792
What part of
"you're being framed"

01:15.840 --> 01:17.102
do you not understand?

01:17.140 --> 01:18.505
For treason? For murder?

01:18.540 --> 01:20.132
Arthur West thought
there was a mole inside MI6.

01:20.180 --> 01:22.239
Are you saying that
the mole is framing Mycroft?

01:22.280 --> 01:23.474
Quite successfully,
as it turns out.

01:23.510 --> 01:24.738
MYCROFI':
Bollocks!

01:24.780 --> 01:26.179
You realized Joan was here

01:26.220 --> 01:27.642
and you manufactured
a reason to intervene.

01:27.680 --> 01:29.318
When MI6 asked you to join them,

01:29.350 --> 01:31.443
did they tell you you'd
be an asset or just as ass?

01:31.490 --> 01:32.889
Okay. Back up.

01:32.920 --> 01:34.581
You said the gun that was used
to kill West just turned up?

01:34.620 --> 01:36.121
Obviously planted by the mole.

01:36.160 --> 01:37.184
Wait, you said
my prints were on it.

01:37.230 --> 01:38.629
That's impossible.

01:38.660 --> 01:40.150
I've only ever handled
my own weapon.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.895
Fingerprint transference
would be child's play

01:41.930 --> 01:44.421
to a well-trained spy, and if
you don't know that by now,

01:44.470 --> 01:45.789
then you deserve to be framed.

01:45.830 --> 01:47.639
In my experience,

01:47.670 --> 01:49.206
the best frame-ups
tend to terminate

01:49.240 --> 01:50.798
with murder of the "frame-ee."

01:50.840 --> 01:53.707
What are you doing?

01:53.740 --> 01:55.207
Proving a point.

01:57.510 --> 01:59.341
You're car...

01:59.380 --> 02:00.449
I looked it over
on the way over here.

02:00.480 --> 02:02.209
It's an impressive vehicle.

02:02.250 --> 02:04.241
I particularly like the
remote starter function.

02:04.290 --> 02:05.279
(engine starts)

02:06.320 --> 02:07.548
(gasps)

02:07.590 --> 02:10.286
(car alarm blaring)

02:10.330 --> 02:11.683
Shall we go now?

02:11.730 --> 02:14.153
Or would you like to see
what else the mole has in store?

02:53.240 --> 02:54.969
HOLMES:
Make yourselves at home.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.833
Don't touch any of the
first editions.

02:57.870 --> 03:00.304
Or Watson.

03:02.710 --> 03:04.473
What is this place?

03:04.510 --> 03:06.842
It was restored and stocked

03:06.880 --> 03:09.314
by one of
Ms. Hudson's patrons.

03:09.350 --> 03:10.612
He intended to
give it to Columbia,

03:10.650 --> 03:11.810
but apparently,
he's got some issues

03:11.850 --> 03:13.283
with the way
they teach Greek history.

03:13.320 --> 03:14.856
Aanay, she's
looking after it...

03:14.890 --> 03:17.688
while the litigation
sorts itself out.

03:17.730 --> 03:19.618
Are you sure
we weren't followed?

03:19.660 --> 03:20.922
You know my methods.

03:20.960 --> 03:22.359
Besides...

03:22.400 --> 03:23.867
_I think our mole
IS a force of one.

03:23.900 --> 03:25.390
I saw no evidence
that Mycroft's flat

03:25.430 --> 03:26.795
was being monitored.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.728
Which suggests that our traitor
is finding it difficult

03:28.770 --> 03:30.829
to stalk my brother
whilst holding down his day job.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.307
I know it's a lot,
but you have to remember

03:34.340 --> 03:35.500
we're ahead of the game.

03:35.540 --> 03:36.677
No one but Sherlock knows

03:36.710 --> 03:37.802
that the fingerprints
on the gun were yours.

03:37.850 --> 03:38.805
HOLMES: But that's
not true, actually.

03:38.850 --> 03:41.011
I-I called MI6,
I told them about the prints.

03:41.050 --> 03:42.517
I also told them I think that

03:42.550 --> 03:43.642
you're the traitor
in their midst.

03:43.690 --> 03:44.714
Wh-Why would you...?

03:44.750 --> 03:48.481
One, the frame-up is on,
whether we like it or not.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.579
Your prints will be identified,
the mole will see to that.

03:50.630 --> 03:53.895
Two, I plan to feign
allegiance to MI6,

03:53.930 --> 03:55.921
so I can search for_ the
real culprit from the InSIde.

03:55.960 --> 03:56.824
You're my brother.
Do you really think...?

03:56.870 --> 03:58.269
That I can convince them

03:58.300 --> 03:59.961
I dislike you enough...
to help them

04:00.000 --> 04:01.831
bring you to justice?
I shall dig deep.

04:01.870 --> 04:02.962
Where are you going?

04:03.010 --> 04:04.602
The agency's favorite local.

04:04.640 --> 04:05.902
I've got a meeting with him
in 20 minutes.

04:05.940 --> 04:08.534
Feel free to _
resume your ruttIng.

04:13.550 --> 04:16.018
Mr. Holmes, you're late.

04:16.050 --> 04:17.586
Apologies.

04:17.620 --> 04:19.042
It's my first cabal.

04:19.090 --> 04:20.910
Before we go any further,

04:20.960 --> 04:22.655
I want to make something
very clear: I'm as motivated

04:22.690 --> 04:23.952
to find my brother
as anyone in this room.

04:23.990 --> 04:25.787
May I remind you,

04:25.830 --> 04:27.957
there's still no proof
that he compromised the agency.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.968
Only that he killed
Arthur West.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.865
Who was certain enough
of a mole's presence

04:31.900 --> 04:33.959
to tattoo both of his arms
with evidence.

04:34.000 --> 04:34.967
This evidence.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.059
This... gibberish?

04:37.110 --> 04:38.759
Someone thought that gibberish
was important enough

04:38.810 --> 04:40.004
to infiltrate a city morgue

04:40.040 --> 04:41.769
and make off with
both of his arms.

04:41.810 --> 04:44.005
Mycroft and I go way back,
as you know.

04:44.050 --> 04:45.972
He wasn't one of us,

04:46.010 --> 04:48.342
not exactly,
but he did good work.

04:48.380 --> 04:51.986
So, what could have
possessed him to turn traitor?

04:52.020 --> 04:53.658
IfI had to guess,
I would say a woman.

04:53.690 --> 04:55.510
He's always exhibited
poor judgment

04:55.560 --> 04:56.982
when it_comes to
the fairer sex,

04:57.030 --> 04:58.986
so perhaps he was seduced
into his betrayals.

04:59.030 --> 05:00.622
It's my understanding

05:00.660 --> 05:02.093
he'd taken to
bedding your partner.

05:02.130 --> 05:05.065
And while I think
it's unlikely

05:05.100 --> 05:06.021
that_she_ is the
corrupting Influence,

05:06.070 --> 05:07.799
it has become
apparent of late

05:07.840 --> 05:09.808
that I do not know her
as well as I thought.

05:09.840 --> 05:12.058
If she engages in
any suspicious activity,

05:12.110 --> 05:13.805
I will alert you.
In the meantime,

05:13.840 --> 05:16.070
I need everything you have
on my brother.

05:16.110 --> 05:17.646
I need his files.

05:17.680 --> 05:18.908
I need his
records of correspondence...

05:18.950 --> 05:20.815
You don't have clearance.

05:20.850 --> 05:22.784
Data, data, data.

05:22.820 --> 05:25.015
I can not make bricks
without clay.

05:25.050 --> 05:28.451
I know there's no love lost
between you and your brother...

05:28.490 --> 05:30.378
but the fact remains...

05:30.430 --> 05:32.125
he is your brother.

05:32.160 --> 05:33.957
You no longer
wish my assistance.

05:34.000 --> 05:34.989
Very well.

05:36.700 --> 05:37.928
But you should know--

05:37.970 --> 05:39.790
should I divine
Mycroft's whereabouts

05:39.840 --> 05:41.592
by myself,
you have my word

05:41.640 --> 05:43.335
the agency will be
the first to know.

05:45.510 --> 05:47.068
(sighs)
Well, the good news is

05:47.110 --> 05:48.907
that this place
is pretty secure...

05:48.940 --> 05:50.601
but if you're gonna be
here for a few days,

05:50.650 --> 05:53.346
we're gonna have to
get you some food.

05:54.980 --> 05:58.984
"He has no ambition
and no energy.

05:59.020 --> 06:00.988
"He will not even
go out of his way

06:01.020 --> 06:03.124
"to verify his own solutions.

06:03.160 --> 06:05.481
"He would rather be

06:05.530 --> 06:07.418
"considered wrong...

06:07.460 --> 06:10.588
then go to the trouble
of proving himself right."

06:13.700 --> 06:16.601
Something I overheard Sherlock
say to my father once.

06:18.770 --> 06:20.772
He was 15.

06:22.080 --> 06:24.048
I can't even
picture him at 15.

06:27.020 --> 06:28.009
It hurt...

06:29.120 --> 06:31.441
to be...

06:31.490 --> 06:33.412
"assessed..."

06:33.460 --> 06:34.859
like that.

06:34.890 --> 06:36.755
He knows a lot.

06:36.790 --> 06:38.052
He doesn't know everything.

06:38.090 --> 06:40.854
I could have
followed father into business.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.527
I could have...

06:42.570 --> 06:44.458
followed Sherlock into his...

06:45.900 --> 06:46.889
...passions,

06:46.940 --> 06:48.430
but I...

06:48.470 --> 06:49.732
wanted...

06:52.170 --> 06:53.171
...this, I suppose.

06:53.210 --> 06:55.974
You are a success.

06:56.010 --> 06:57.602
You own restaurants
all over Europe.

06:57.650 --> 06:59.470
And the things that you've done
for your country...

06:59.520 --> 07:00.919
Folly.

07:00.950 --> 07:02.611
Obviously.

07:04.750 --> 07:07.150
I should have said no
when the agency approached me.

07:09.120 --> 07:12.897
But I remembered
what Sherlock said...

07:12.930 --> 07:16.661
and I remembered my father
failing to disagree.

07:18.230 --> 07:20.460
And I...

07:20.500 --> 07:22.900
I thought...

07:22.940 --> 07:24.828
I could prove,
at least to myself,

07:24.870 --> 07:27.202
that I was...

07:27.240 --> 07:29.504
more than what they thought.

07:31.550 --> 07:33.177
Idiocy.

07:35.850 --> 07:37.738
(sighs)

07:42.090 --> 07:44.024
(sighs)

07:44.060 --> 07:46.449
Took your time.

07:48.930 --> 07:51.160
WATSON: Oh, that's the store
that Julian Afkhami owns.

07:51.200 --> 07:53.191
The man who Arthur West thought
was an Iranian spy.

07:53.240 --> 07:57.108
The same man he thought was
corresponding with the mole.

07:57.140 --> 07:59.165
Well, I get why
you'd want to surveil it;

07:59.210 --> 08:00.575
what I don't get is why

08:00.610 --> 08:02.237
you thought you needed
to rent a car.

08:02.280 --> 08:03.645
I didn't rent it.

08:03.680 --> 08:05.204
I just needed
somewhere to sit.

08:06.980 --> 08:08.208
You broke into this car.

08:08.250 --> 08:10.616
It was the best available
vantage pomt.

08:10.650 --> 08:11.878
(sighs)

08:13.990 --> 08:17.653
So, the o-- the other day,
you were...

08:17.690 --> 08:19.624
quite appropriately,
angry with Mycroft...

08:19.660 --> 08:20.797
and then, this morning,

08:20.830 --> 08:22.718
I find you in his bed.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.128
So... what changed?

08:28.170 --> 08:30.661
So, how'd it go with MI6?

08:32.170 --> 08:34.604
Pooï¬‚y.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.676
My assistance
is no longer welcome.

08:36.710 --> 08:38.769
Hence my decision
to approach this problem

08:38.810 --> 08:40.914
from a different angle.
Huh...

08:42.180 --> 08:44.842
Joan Watson
meet Julian Afkhami.

08:44.890 --> 08:48.280
His decision to keep
late hours has, thus far,

08:48.320 --> 08:50.322
prevented my inspection
of his workplace.

08:50.360 --> 08:52.555
But I was able to
root around to the basement

08:52.600 --> 08:54.022
beneath the building.

08:54.060 --> 08:56.790
Marion told us Arthur
had been monitoring him,

08:56.830 --> 09:00.061
so, naturally, I looked in
the telephone junction box

09:00.100 --> 09:02.239
and I found this

09:02.270 --> 09:05.205
spliced into
the Azatan Books' line.

09:05.240 --> 09:06.776
What is it?

09:06.810 --> 09:09.233
It's a transmitter.

09:09.280 --> 09:11.202
Can't be certain it's
Arthur West's, of course, but..

09:11.250 --> 09:12.774
given his obsession
with Afkhami,

09:12.820 --> 09:14.617
he seems the _
most likely culprit.

09:14.650 --> 09:15.776
Okay. So...

09:15.820 --> 09:18.209
West listened in on his calls.
What could he have learned?

09:18.250 --> 09:20.855
I mean, what are the chances
Afkhami used his business line

09:20.890 --> 09:22.881
to place calls to the mole?

09:22.930 --> 09:24.352
Well, he obviously thought
he'd learned something.

09:24.390 --> 09:26.051
Or have you forgotten about
the numbers and letters

09:26.090 --> 09:27.796
he had tattooed on his arms?
You mean, the ones

09:27.830 --> 09:28.899
that don't seem
to make any sense.

09:28.930 --> 09:30.898
Yes, of course, I remember--
Shh.

09:34.900 --> 09:36.800
It's time.

09:40.380 --> 09:41.938
Well, you'll never guess
what I found

09:41.980 --> 09:43.174
in the stockroom.

09:43.210 --> 09:44.939
Stock.

09:44.980 --> 09:46.811
As far as I can tell,
this place is exactly

09:46.850 --> 09:48.272
what it looks like:
A bookstore.

09:50.150 --> 09:52.038
You haven't
had luck either, huh?

09:52.090 --> 09:54.388
My experience-- diligence
is the mother of luck.

09:54.420 --> 09:56.820
Oh, so, suddenly,
I'm not diligent.

09:56.860 --> 09:58.259
Don't know what you are,
Watson. Not lately.

09:58.290 --> 10:00.895
You are angry
because I'm moving out.

10:00.930 --> 10:03.023
Not angry.
I'm disappointed.

10:03.070 --> 10:05.288
You're still unformed
as a detective.

10:05.330 --> 10:07.639
I told you, I don't want
to stop working with you.

10:07.670 --> 10:09.900
You just want to do it
on your own terms, is that it?

10:09.940 --> 10:11.009
_ I am not the one
With terms, okay? You are.

10:11.040 --> 10:12.109
You're like, made of them.

10:12.140 --> 10:13.107
You have been
from the beginning.

10:13.140 --> 10:15.199
Or perhaps this was a mistake.

10:15.240 --> 10:18.300
You mean breaking in here?

10:21.980 --> 10:24.289
That surge protector.

10:24.320 --> 10:27.084
It's right next to the register,

10:27.120 --> 10:28.985
the fax,
the credit card scanner,

10:29.020 --> 10:30.954
but they're all plugged into
this extension cord,

10:30.990 --> 10:32.821
which runs back there.

10:45.340 --> 10:47.228
That's not a protector.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.929
That's a scrambler.

10:48.980 --> 10:51.346
By the looks of it,

10:51.380 --> 10:54.941
it's_ been here
for qurte some tIme.

10:54.980 --> 10:56.117
So, whenever Afkhami
wanted to communicate

10:56.150 --> 10:58.015
with anyone related
to his spy work,

10:58.050 --> 11:01.850
he'd plug his phone
into one of these jacks...

11:01.890 --> 11:04.029
and the scrambler would have
prevented Arthur West

11:04.060 --> 11:05.880
or any snoop from making out
a single word

11:05.930 --> 11:07.727
of their conversations.

11:07.760 --> 11:09.057
Here.

11:09.100 --> 11:10.863
I don't understand.

11:10.900 --> 11:13.789
If West couldn't make out
what Afkhami was saying, then...

11:13.840 --> 11:15.933
how did he know there
was a mole in M16?

11:17.310 --> 11:19.665
You know, I believe
I know precisely how.

11:29.380 --> 11:31.712
West used that to monitor
the calls between

11:31.750 --> 11:33.183
the mole and Afkhami.

11:33.220 --> 11:35.188
Unfortunately, Afkhami used
the scrambler that we found

11:35.220 --> 11:37.484
to garble those conversations.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.088
So, all West would have been
able to determine

11:39.130 --> 11:41.098
is the meta-data
pertaining to each call.

11:41.130 --> 11:43.428
Meta-data?
He would have
been able to determine

11:43.470 --> 11:44.425
the date and time
of each call,

11:44.470 --> 11:45.494
but more crucially,

11:45.530 --> 11:46.565
the location of the caller.

11:48.540 --> 11:51.008
That's the information
he had tattooed on his arms.

11:51.040 --> 11:52.359
These are obviously
dates and times,

11:52.410 --> 11:54.037
but how do you get a location
from that column?

11:54.080 --> 11:56.469
Well, naturally, the mole would
have used disposable phones

11:56.510 --> 11:59.047
to contact Afkhami,
but the calls themselves...

11:59.080 --> 12:02.015
would have been routed through
the nearest cell phone tower.

12:02.050 --> 12:03.847
Now, every cell phone tower
in the world,

12:03.890 --> 12:05.983
has_a r_adio transmitter
With Its own unique

12:06.020 --> 12:07.248
call signal.

12:07.290 --> 12:08.951
The first letter
of each call signal

12:08.990 --> 12:09.922
narrows the location down,

12:09.960 --> 12:11.928
so, a call signal
with the first letter, "K,"

12:11.960 --> 12:14.053
originated in the United States,
west of the Mississippi.

12:14.100 --> 12:15.795
A "W," is the east.

12:15.830 --> 12:17.058
"G," is our homeland
of Great Britain;

12:17.100 --> 12:18.465
you'll see many of the calls
originated there.

12:18.500 --> 12:20.991
"I," is Italy
and so on and so forth.

12:21.040 --> 12:24.464
Now, if we can determine
who in M16 called Afkhami

12:24.510 --> 12:27.001
from these locations on_the
dates and times In question...

12:27.040 --> 12:29.429
we'll have our mole.

12:29.480 --> 12:32.847
Where does the signal,
"VNA," originate?

12:32.880 --> 12:34.074
Australia.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.872
The cell phone tower
in question is in Sydney.

12:35.920 --> 12:39.481
I was in Sydney
January 14, this year.

12:39.520 --> 12:44.321
I was in Rome April 1, 2013...

12:44.360 --> 12:47.454
I was in all of these places
at all of these times.

12:50.030 --> 12:52.521
Well, surely,
it's not a coincidence.

12:52.570 --> 12:55.437
You've been set up,

12:55.470 --> 12:58.962
because you were in the same
locations as the mole.

12:59.010 --> 12:59.977
Think.

13:00.010 --> 13:04.003
Who else was in those locations
on those dates?

13:06.110 --> 13:07.372
Your handler Sherrington.

13:08.850 --> 13:10.818
He went to the _
same places you did.

13:10.850 --> 13:12.044
He's the mole.

13:12.090 --> 13:14.081
He murdered Arthur West
and then framed you.

13:14.120 --> 13:16.213
Well, that doesn't
make any sense.

13:16.260 --> 13:17.955
Sherrington
brought you onto this.

13:17.990 --> 13:21.528
Which suggests that
it was his superior,

13:21.560 --> 13:24.393
Sir Walter, who insisted
on my involvement.

13:25.630 --> 13:28.064
We must not _
say anything to Sherrington

13:28.100 --> 13:30.136
which might reveal
that we know.

13:30.170 --> 13:31.967
A game of cat-and-mouse
is afoot.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.236
We need to prove
that he's guilty of murder,

13:35.280 --> 13:37.248
before he manages to find you.

13:37.280 --> 13:38.838
(pen clacks onto table)

13:42.050 --> 13:46.441
*

13:46.490 --> 13:49.152
(phone ringing)

13:52.160 --> 13:54.492
Sherlock Holmes.

13:54.530 --> 13:57.590
I'm dearly hoping you have
something I can tell Sir Walter

13:57.630 --> 13:59.962
about your brother's
whereabouts.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.332
Mr. Sherrington.

14:02.370 --> 14:03.564
Frustrating day?

14:03.610 --> 14:05.134
The devil's own.

14:05.170 --> 14:07.377
Your progress?

14:07.410 --> 14:09.332
HOLMES:
Mycroft is the nominal head of
one of my father's charities

14:09.380 --> 14:10.472
and we think he may have
moved some funds

14:10.510 --> 14:11.545
out of their accounts

14:11.580 --> 14:13.343
to finance his escape.

14:13.380 --> 14:16.019
We're tracking the whereabouts
of a large withdrawal.

14:16.050 --> 14:17.187
If we follow the money,

14:17.220 --> 14:18.915
hopefully we'll find
the man himself.

14:18.950 --> 14:21.089
I'll need the details
of that transaction

14:21.120 --> 14:23.350
and any other news
as soon as you get it.

14:25.630 --> 14:29.259
WATSON: Hey.
I heard you're working.

14:29.300 --> 14:31.359
I'm considering the dates
Afkhami and Sherrington spoke.

14:31.400 --> 14:34.062
I would like to get
a more precise bead
on what they discussed.

14:34.100 --> 14:36.330
Okay. So, how do we do that?

14:36.370 --> 14:38.600
I'd like to work on my own,
if it's all the same to you.

14:38.640 --> 14:41.074
Your decision to
find new lodgings

14:41.110 --> 14:43.146
necessitates the adaptation
of my methods.

14:43.180 --> 14:44.499
I need to grow accustomed

14:44.550 --> 14:46.177
to working without your input
in the evenings,

14:46.210 --> 14:48.246
and I prefer
to begin immediately.

15:04.300 --> 15:06.996
(sighs)

15:27.590 --> 15:30.923
*

15:38.430 --> 15:40.091
Looks like you
had a productive night.

15:40.140 --> 15:42.028
Quite.

15:42.070 --> 15:44.334
A bracing reminder that I can
function efficiently

15:44.370 --> 15:46.031
as a lone deductionist,

15:46.070 --> 15:48.038
should the
circumstances dictate.

15:48.080 --> 15:51.106
"Computer virus stymied."

15:51.150 --> 15:53.471
British intelligence apparently
concocted some malware

15:53.520 --> 15:56.478
and unleashed it on the
Iranian government's servers.

15:56.520 --> 15:58.340
It was intended to retard the
progress

15:58.390 --> 15:59.584
of their nuclear program,

15:59.620 --> 16:01.110
but an anonymous source

16:01.160 --> 16:03.185
alerted the Iranians
to its presence

16:03.230 --> 16:05.323
and they rooted it out
before it did any damage,

16:05.360 --> 16:08.022
after the Iranians made the
existence of the virus public.

16:08.060 --> 16:09.596
You think Sherrington
tipped them off.

16:09.630 --> 16:14.135
The virus was successfully
counted on 11th of July, 2012,

16:14.170 --> 16:17.139
four days after a conversation
between Afkhami and Sherrington.

16:17.170 --> 16:20.173
Three days after a conversation
in October, 2013,

16:20.210 --> 16:22.599
a British aid worker,
stationed in Tehran,

16:22.640 --> 16:24.301
was arrested for espionage.

16:24.350 --> 16:26.341
Sherrington passed this
information to Afkhami

16:26.380 --> 16:28.211
on every call,
so these are the results.

16:28.250 --> 16:29.774
There were 20 such
conversations.

16:29.820 --> 16:33.358
I have accounted for the results
of all of them, except for one.

16:34.520 --> 16:36.317
The results of the
March 5th tte--tte

16:36.360 --> 16:38.351
have yet to reveal themselves.

16:38.390 --> 16:40.620
It's still pretty recent.
Maybe it hasn't happened yet.

16:40.660 --> 16:44.562
All of these ripples happened
within a week of contact.

16:44.600 --> 16:48.092
There's something
I haven't spotted.

16:48.140 --> 16:50.529
(phone ringing)

16:52.140 --> 16:54.335
Captain Gregson.
Good morning.

16:57.350 --> 16:58.544
Yes. Right away.

17:00.680 --> 17:02.318
Is everything okay?

17:02.350 --> 17:03.647
It seems he may have divined

17:03.690 --> 17:06.113
I've been aiding
and abetting a fugitive.

17:06.150 --> 17:08.050
(sighs)

17:10.490 --> 17:13.288
Well, don't keep me in suspense.

17:13.330 --> 17:15.059
What information do you have?

17:15.100 --> 17:17.568
The department's in possession
of the handgun

17:17.600 --> 17:19.522
used to kill Arthur West.

17:19.570 --> 17:22.437
It has readable prints,
but they're not in AFIS.

17:22.470 --> 17:24.267
West was a British national.

17:24.310 --> 17:25.561
Detective Bell,

17:25.610 --> 17:28.534
being the exemplary
investigator that he is,

17:28.580 --> 17:30.377
spent some time
getting in touch

17:30.410 --> 17:33.277
with various departments
over there.

17:33.320 --> 17:35.117
The police in Cambridge
had a match.

17:35.150 --> 17:37.846
They picked up a college kid
with a bag of pot

17:37.890 --> 17:40.688
almost 30 years ago.

17:40.720 --> 17:43.484
His name was
Mycroft Holmes.

17:43.530 --> 17:45.384
As it turns out,

17:45.430 --> 17:47.648
that name's all over
the department.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.554
Someone blew up
a Jaguar the other day.

17:49.600 --> 17:50.624
Belonging to--

17:50.670 --> 17:52.228
would you believe it--

17:52.270 --> 17:54.135
Mycroft Holmes.

17:55.900 --> 17:57.333
So, who have you told
about this?

17:57.370 --> 17:58.632
No one.

17:58.670 --> 18:00.604
Yet.

18:00.640 --> 18:02.631
Where's your brother?

18:02.680 --> 18:05.672
And what are his fingerprints
doing on a murder weapon?

18:08.580 --> 18:09.569
I assure you

18:09.620 --> 18:11.645
that Mycroft is not a killer.

18:11.690 --> 18:14.716
If he's innocent,
you should let us help.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.729
There are certain
forces at play here.

18:17.760 --> 18:20.524
There are always
"forces at play" with you.

18:20.560 --> 18:22.721
I don't know your brother,

18:22.760 --> 18:25.524
but I do know that he
left his fingerprints

18:25.570 --> 18:29.688
at the scene of_a_n
execution-style killing.

18:29.740 --> 18:32.607
I'm gonna put out
a Finest Message

18:32.640 --> 18:34.369
and a Want Card.

18:34.410 --> 18:35.707
And when I do,
there's gonna be

18:35.740 --> 18:38.447
plenty of people
that are wondering

18:38.480 --> 18:42.371
why our consultant's brother
is wanted for murder.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.781
(mouse clicks)

18:51.590 --> 18:53.490
(doorbell buzzes)

18:56.300 --> 18:57.699
Who is it?

18:57.730 --> 18:59.698
Tim Sherrington.

18:59.730 --> 19:02.733
Sorry to drop by unannounced.

19:04.710 --> 19:06.632
Uh, could you just
give me a minute?

19:12.650 --> 19:13.810
Sorry about that.

19:13.850 --> 19:14.919
Uh, Sherlock's
not here right now.

19:14.950 --> 19:16.679
Oh, that's quite all right.

19:16.720 --> 19:18.881
I was actually rather hoping
to have a word with you.

19:20.590 --> 19:23.821
I was just keeping up with
the rest of our caseload.

19:23.860 --> 19:26.328
I'm expecting a Slqpe from
one of our contacts any minute.

19:26.360 --> 19:27.827
Oh. I won't keep you long.

19:27.860 --> 19:29.657
I just wanted to pick
your brains for a little while.

19:29.700 --> 19:33.192
I must admit, Mycroft has
disappeared more effectively

19:33.240 --> 19:34.798
than I'd have thought possible.

19:34.840 --> 19:37.661
It's made the investigation
a tad frustrating.

19:37.710 --> 19:39.837
So I gather.

19:40.840 --> 19:43.673
From what I understand...

19:43.710 --> 19:46.508
you and Mycroft
were involved for a time.

19:46.550 --> 19:48.939
I wondered if you had
any personal insights

19:48.980 --> 19:51.210
as to where he might be?

19:51.250 --> 19:53.718
"Insights," um...

19:53.760 --> 19:56.479
I think you're asking
the wrong person.

19:56.520 --> 19:58.886
I had no idea he was tied up
with Le Milieu or with you.

19:58.930 --> 20:00.955
Turns out,
I know next to nothing

20:01.000 --> 20:03.525
about Mycroft Holmes.

20:04.770 --> 20:06.192
Fair enough.

20:07.470 --> 20:09.688
So, what about
your investigation?

20:09.740 --> 20:11.401
Anything worth sharing?

20:11.440 --> 20:13.408
Uh... no major breakthroughs.

20:13.440 --> 20:14.976
Although, we are
investigating the possibility

20:15.010 --> 20:17.706
that he purchased some property
in the Catskills

20:17.750 --> 20:19.502
under the_name
of one of his investors.

20:19.550 --> 20:21.541
There's a chance that
he might be hiding out there,

20:21.580 --> 20:23.389
but I think he's
smarter than that, so...

20:23.420 --> 20:24.717
(wry laugh)

20:24.750 --> 20:28.709
I'm sorry, but, uh,

20:28.760 --> 20:32.924
last night, your partner
told me that you thought...

20:32.960 --> 20:35.724
he'd raided one of
his dad's charities.

20:35.760 --> 20:39.560
So I was just pondering
which of those stories was true.

20:39.600 --> 20:41.932
If, indeed...

20:41.970 --> 20:43.938
either one is.

20:45.810 --> 20:47.277
I wonder...

20:47.310 --> 20:49.699
ifI were to hold you down

20:49.740 --> 20:53.870
and threaten to put one of
your eyes out with my thumb...

20:53.920 --> 20:56.718
would you tell me
where you're hiding him?

20:56.750 --> 20:59.389
I've a mind to do it.

20:59.420 --> 21:01.752
Actually, we're not alone,
everyone is here.

21:03.090 --> 21:04.785
Not "everyone"
in the general sense,

21:04.830 --> 21:06.980
"Everyone" the proper noun--
the cyber-activists.

21:08.860 --> 21:12.364
I opened up a chat
with maybe 15 of them

21:12.400 --> 21:13.958
when you rang the doorbell.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.730
I thought it might
come in handy.

21:27.850 --> 21:29.943
(quietly):
I look forward to dealing with

21:29.980 --> 21:32.346
you and the Holmes boys later.

21:32.390 --> 21:35.951
_ I look forward to
seeing you on trial for murder.

21:50.610 --> 21:52.931
Watson!

21:52.970 --> 21:53.971
I'm fine. I'm fine.

21:54.010 --> 21:55.477
I told you that
when I called.

21:55.510 --> 21:57.000
It's okay.
It is, in point of fact,

21:57.040 --> 21:58.541
the very opposite of okay.

21:58.580 --> 22:00.377
Sherrington knows
we're onto him.

22:00.420 --> 22:01.876
He's gonna
complicate things.
Yes. I know.

22:01.920 --> 22:03.387
So, it's a good thing
I figured out

22:03.420 --> 22:04.318
another piece of the puzzle
before he got here.

22:04.350 --> 22:06.443
The communication
between him and Afkhami?

22:06.490 --> 22:08.708
You said there were
20 different calls, right?

22:08.760 --> 22:10.648
You found a corresponding
ripple effect for all of them

22:10.690 --> 22:12.123
except for the 17th one--

22:12.160 --> 22:13.457
a call that was placed
from the mole

22:13.500 --> 22:14.797
to Afkhami in March.

22:14.830 --> 22:16.058
You gonna tell me
your breakthrough

22:16.100 --> 22:17.795
_or continue to
remind me of my own?

22:17.830 --> 22:19.889
I don't know. Maybe if you
hadn't cut me off last night,

22:19.930 --> 22:21.363
we could have had this
breakthrough together,

22:21.400 --> 22:22.298
not to mention,
alotsoonen

22:22.340 --> 22:24.137
Listen, I think I understand
the significance

22:24.170 --> 22:25.933
of the 17th call.

22:25.970 --> 22:27.631
There were repercussions
in the days that followed,

22:27.680 --> 22:29.500
they just weren't global;
they were local.

22:31.150 --> 22:34.540
WATSON: Nadir Khadem was found
bound and beaten to death

22:34.580 --> 22:35.945
in a vacant apartment
in Bed-Stuy on March 7,

22:35.980 --> 22:38.380
just two days after
call number 17.

22:38.420 --> 22:39.648
He was Iranian.

22:39.690 --> 22:41.112
Yes. Same as Julian Afkhami.

22:41.160 --> 22:42.684
Detectives _
who were investigating

22:42.720 --> 22:44.483
thought that he was killed
over gambling debts...

22:44.530 --> 22:46.452
but a blog written
by a Persian migr

22:46.490 --> 22:47.491
maintained that his death

22:47.530 --> 22:50.465
was a political assassination.

22:50.500 --> 22:52.661
So he was active in trying
to provide unfettered access

22:52.700 --> 22:55.168
to the Internet...
for Iranian citizens.

22:55.200 --> 22:56.861
Would have made him
a target of the regime.

22:56.900 --> 22:59.562
You think Sherrington
helped Afkhami locate Khadem

22:59.610 --> 23:01.635
for the Iranian government.

23:01.680 --> 23:02.977
Then Afkhami passed that
information off to the person,

23:03.010 --> 23:04.705
or people, who killed him.

23:06.980 --> 23:08.743
You get that this
is a good thing, right?

23:08.780 --> 23:10.418
The crime took place
in New York.

23:10.450 --> 23:11.747
Everything else
was outside the country.

23:11.790 --> 23:13.109
There's evidence we can look at,

23:13.150 --> 23:14.754
people we can talk to--
I'm sorry.

23:14.790 --> 23:16.655
I'm still distracted

23:16.690 --> 23:17.850
by the visit you were paid
by Mr. Sherrington.

23:17.890 --> 23:19.585
I handled it.

23:19.630 --> 23:20.790
Well, you shouldn't have
had to handle it!

23:20.830 --> 23:22.491
Just as you
shouldn't have had to

23:22.530 --> 23:24.669
fear for you life
several days ago.

23:24.700 --> 23:25.894
If we hadn't been
pulled into the vortex

23:25.930 --> 23:27.591
that is my brother's life...

23:27.640 --> 23:29.460
He didn't mean for
any of this to happen.

23:29.500 --> 23:31.764
Cancer cells don't mean to
suffocate healthy ones.

23:31.810 --> 23:32.799
They just do.

23:32.840 --> 23:33.977
So he's a cancer now?

23:34.010 --> 23:35.534
You object to that comparison

23:35.580 --> 23:38.140
because he's
a leukemia survwor, but...

23:38.180 --> 23:39.579
given Michael's
ability to toxify

23:39.610 --> 23:41.077
people, places and things,

23:41.120 --> 23:42.644
I submit his disease's remission

23:42.680 --> 23:45.114
was less miracle and more
profe55ional courtesy.

23:45.150 --> 23:46.811
Everything that happened
with MI6:

23:46.850 --> 23:48.579
Me being taken,
Mycroft being framed...

23:48.620 --> 23:49.917
You keep insisting that
it's all his fault,

23:49.960 --> 23:51.154
but it's not.

23:51.190 --> 23:52.657
You played a big part
in it too.

23:52.690 --> 23:53.952
Are you sure Sherrington
didn't strike you?

23:54.000 --> 23:55.092
Perhaps, about that head?

23:55.130 --> 23:56.757
Sudomo Han.

23:56.800 --> 23:58.665
He hired you once,

23:58.700 --> 24:00.964
back in London.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.468
But you didn't know
what he really was.

24:09.610 --> 24:11.703
(light switch clicks)

24:11.750 --> 24:13.547
Sherlock.

24:15.280 --> 24:16.611
Something happened?

24:18.050 --> 24:19.881
Your old friend, the, uh...

24:19.920 --> 24:21.911
handler...

24:23.190 --> 24:24.521
...paid Watson a visit.

24:24.560 --> 24:26.619
I-Is she...?
She's unharmed.

24:26.660 --> 24:28.924
But he knows that we know.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.734
There will
undoubtedly be consequences.

24:37.270 --> 24:39.033
That's not why you're here.

24:41.740 --> 24:43.742
So I know the truth about you.

24:45.210 --> 24:47.872
MI6.

24:47.920 --> 24:50.047
You'd got out and...

24:51.920 --> 24:54.855
...they pulled you back in
because of me.

24:54.890 --> 24:57.620
Joan.

24:57.660 --> 24:58.752
Yeah.

24:58.790 --> 25:02.248
I know you didn't tell her.

25:02.300 --> 25:05.121
You're angry.

25:05.170 --> 25:08.037
I'm just confused.

25:13.210 --> 25:16.031
You owed me...

25:16.080 --> 25:18.844
nothing.

25:22.980 --> 25:25.210
You're my brother.

25:35.100 --> 25:38.991
The connection
between my drug use...

25:39.030 --> 25:40.964
and the mistakes I made
regarding Sudomo Han

25:41.000 --> 25:42.729
could not be more obvious.

25:45.340 --> 25:47.672
And the program to which
I owe my sobriety

25:47.710 --> 25:49.575
dictates that I make an amends.

25:53.010 --> 25:56.741
And at_ the
appropriate juncture...

25:56.780 --> 25:58.782
I shall.

25:58.820 --> 26:01.254
In the meantime...

26:02.920 --> 26:05.559
...you should know that
I'm gonna fix this.

26:09.630 --> 26:11.097
Every last bit of it.

26:22.340 --> 26:24.672
Why did you want me
to come to the apartment

26:24.710 --> 26:26.177
that Nadir Khadem
was killed in?

26:28.320 --> 26:30.845
Didn't they clean
this place months ago?

26:32.750 --> 26:35.082
You recreated the
blood spatter with paint.

26:35.120 --> 26:37.281
Why?

26:37.320 --> 26:39.686
They have crime scene photos
for that, you know.

26:39.730 --> 26:43.154
Yeah. I've been studying them
quite intently.

26:43.200 --> 26:45.168
Something bothers me
about the photographs,

26:45.200 --> 26:47.998
but the source
of the disconnect eluded me.

26:48.040 --> 26:50.031
So I felt the need to...

26:50.070 --> 26:51.867
immerse myself
in the crime scene.

26:51.910 --> 26:53.878
Well, you definitely did that.

26:53.910 --> 26:56.299
Did it work?

26:56.340 --> 26:58.046
Perhaps.

26:58.080 --> 27:00.742
At least, partially.

27:00.780 --> 27:02.975
I now believe
the official theory

27:03.020 --> 27:05.386
accrued to the murder
of Nadir Khadem

27:05.420 --> 27:08.116
is indeed a canard.

27:08.160 --> 27:10.116
Observe.

27:10.160 --> 27:12.879
If the attacker
had struck him repeatedly

27:12.930 --> 27:14.898
with a bat...

27:14.930 --> 27:18.093
blood would have flown
off the weapon

27:18.130 --> 27:19.791
as he drew it
back for blow

27:19.830 --> 27:22.230
after blow.
Where would it have landed?

27:22.270 --> 27:24.135
Hmm. The ceiling.

27:24.170 --> 27:25.398
The ceiling is clean.

27:25.440 --> 27:26.907
So what do you think happened?

27:26.940 --> 27:28.271
I think
it's unlikely

27:28.310 --> 27:30.278
tha_t_the murder
was politically motivated.

27:30.310 --> 27:33.768
It's too sloppy
to be an assassination.

27:33.820 --> 27:37.142
So that leaves me in search
of a third option.

27:37.180 --> 27:39.444
(sighs)

27:39.490 --> 27:41.958
But it is...

27:41.990 --> 27:44.288
beautiful, isn't it?

27:44.330 --> 27:45.957
I don't know.
It's kind of gruesome.

27:45.990 --> 27:47.287
Not the bloodstains.

27:47.330 --> 27:51.892
The work... which
has led us here.

27:53.870 --> 27:55.838
I deciphered the code
on West's arms.

27:55.870 --> 27:58.407
You found the murder
of Nadir Khadem,

27:58.440 --> 28:00.931
the elusive
17th ripple effect,

28:00.980 --> 28:02.936
I recreate the scene,

28:02.980 --> 28:05.175
and now, here we are,

28:05.210 --> 28:08.441
on the verge of
a breakthrough.

28:13.420 --> 28:17.151
Our collaboration works, Watson.

28:17.190 --> 28:20.751
Even when things are less
than ideal between us,

28:20.800 --> 28:24.019
it works.

28:26.970 --> 28:29.359
When I look back
on the last 18 months,

28:29.400 --> 28:32.767
I often categorize it
as a kind of...

28:32.810 --> 28:35.028
grand experiment.

28:37.440 --> 28:39.908
The results of which
have demonstrated to me,

28:39.950 --> 28:42.339
much to my surprise,

28:42.380 --> 28:45.110
that I am capable of change.

28:46.120 --> 28:48.418
So I will.

28:48.460 --> 28:51.088
Change.

28:51.130 --> 28:53.951
For you.

28:57.260 --> 28:59.399
For the sake of our partnership.

28:59.430 --> 29:03.036
For the sake of our-our work.

29:04.040 --> 29:06.907
Stay.

29:11.010 --> 29:13.979
You have this kind of...

29:14.020 --> 29:17.171
pull.

29:17.220 --> 29:20.041
Like gravity.

29:22.060 --> 29:26.087
I'm so lucky
that I fell into your orbit.

29:27.860 --> 29:30.988
But if we live together,
that's how it will always be.

29:31.030 --> 29:32.520
Me orbiting you.

29:32.570 --> 29:36.028
There'll always be
the next case, the next problem.

29:36.070 --> 29:38.334
And I will always
get pulled along.

29:38.370 --> 29:40.167
It's an exciting
way to live,

29:40.210 --> 29:44.909
but there are
consequences.

29:45.950 --> 29:47.372
We will work this out.

29:47.410 --> 29:50.379
I know we will.

29:50.420 --> 29:53.787
But I need to get my own place.

29:55.260 --> 29:57.785
(sighs)

29:58.590 --> 30:00.785
Are you okay?

30:01.600 --> 30:04.569
(chuckles)

30:04.600 --> 30:07.068
I now know...

30:07.100 --> 30:10.934
how Nadir Khadem was murdered.

30:15.480 --> 30:18.074
MYCROFI':
Drinking on duty?

30:21.320 --> 30:23.276
Sir Walter wouldn't approve.

30:23.320 --> 30:24.912
Well...

30:24.950 --> 30:28.158
what the old man
doesn't know about.

30:29.220 --> 30:31.029
How did you find me?

30:31.060 --> 30:33.028
"Best shepherd's pie
in the city."

30:33.060 --> 30:37.224
Or so you claimed whenever
we found ourselves in New York.

30:41.670 --> 30:45.106
Look, for what it's worth...

30:45.140 --> 30:48.132
I'm sorry.

30:48.180 --> 30:49.829
For...?

30:52.310 --> 30:55.108
I'm not recording you, if that's
what you're worried about.

30:56.150 --> 30:58.118
No.

30:58.150 --> 31:00.539
No, you wouldn't, would you?

31:00.590 --> 31:04.287
It's ungentlemanly.

31:04.330 --> 31:07.185
Just so's you know,
it was his idea

31:07.230 --> 31:10.051
to get your brother
on the West thing.

31:10.100 --> 31:11.522
The old man's.

31:11.570 --> 31:13.367
After that...

31:13.400 --> 31:16.039
things snowballed.

31:20.270 --> 31:24.377
I want to know what it'll cost
to undo this.

31:24.410 --> 31:26.378
You and Walter,

31:26.410 --> 31:29.174
all the other lords and ladies
think your titles

31:29.220 --> 31:31.017
and your money can fix anything.

31:31.050 --> 31:33.211
But some things, some people

31:33.250 --> 31:35.957
are more complicated.

31:35.990 --> 31:38.379
Is that what you are?

31:38.430 --> 31:41.024
Complicated?

31:41.060 --> 31:43.119
I came up in the trenches, mate.

31:43.160 --> 31:44.593
I came up hard.

31:44.630 --> 31:46.621
I'm simple, like a hammer.

31:48.370 --> 31:52.101
But the powers that be
at the agency,

31:52.140 --> 31:55.029
they don't favor blokes like me.

31:55.080 --> 31:57.105
There are ceilings, you know.

31:57.140 --> 32:00.109
And so you committed
multiple acts of treason.

32:00.150 --> 32:02.072
Makes sense to me.

32:04.990 --> 32:07.515
It's a Sig Sauer, isn't it?

32:10.360 --> 32:13.625
Give me one good reason
not to pull the trigger.

32:13.660 --> 32:16.527
Well, I can think of two.

32:16.560 --> 32:19.597
What if Le Milieu
knew the truth about you,

32:19.630 --> 32:21.188
about your role in the downfalls

32:21.240 --> 32:24.209
of some of their more
powerful members.

32:24.240 --> 32:26.003
You're threatening to burn me?

32:26.040 --> 32:27.701
I die, a letter gets mailed.

32:27.740 --> 32:30.174
Some very angry Frenchmen
come looking for you.

32:30.210 --> 32:32.144
Your brother and your bird
will want to help.

32:32.180 --> 32:34.216
But you know Le Milieu.

32:34.250 --> 32:37.310
How messy they can be.

32:37.350 --> 32:40.217
Collateral damage
and such like.

32:43.290 --> 32:44.655
No, I'll tell you
what we'll do.

32:44.690 --> 32:47.284
I'll settle up here.

32:47.330 --> 32:49.719
Then we'll go
for a walk to my car.

32:49.760 --> 32:52.968
And then I'll take you
somewhere nice.

32:54.400 --> 32:57.699
Somewhere quiet.

32:57.740 --> 33:01.176
And then I'll put a bullet
right behind your ear.

33:01.210 --> 33:06.079
I die a traitor and you get away
with everything.

33:07.510 --> 33:09.375
Quite an offer.

33:09.420 --> 33:12.139
Well, it's the best one
you're going to get.

33:12.190 --> 33:14.181
Mate.

33:23.160 --> 33:24.627
Mr. Afkhami,
thanks for coming in.

33:24.670 --> 33:26.558
This is an incredible
inconvenience.

33:26.600 --> 33:28.488
I had to close my store.

33:28.540 --> 33:29.632
Oh, I'm sorry.

33:29.670 --> 33:31.308
We just got a few questions.

33:31.340 --> 33:34.468
Right this way.

33:34.510 --> 33:37.399
(laughs)
I knew of Nadir Khadem.

33:37.440 --> 33:39.499
The Persian community's
a small one,

33:39.550 --> 33:42.371
but I didn't have a relationship
with the man.

33:42.420 --> 33:46.379
Then you probably know we were
investigating his murder.

33:46.420 --> 33:48.581
We've recently
discarded the theory

33:48.620 --> 33:51.623
that he was killed
by someone he owed money to.

33:52.760 --> 33:54.796
The bloodstains
were qUIte unusual.

33:54.830 --> 33:57.151
I tried to reconcile them
with all of the common means

33:57.200 --> 33:59.418
of killing someone,
but I couldn't.

33:59.470 --> 34:01.791
Then I tried to reconcile them
with all the uncommon means

34:01.840 --> 34:03.467
of killing someone.

34:03.500 --> 34:05.502
The blood patterns are
consistent with spatter

34:05.540 --> 34:07.462
that would occur
after a thrown object

34:07.510 --> 34:09.205
struck the head of the victim.

34:09.240 --> 34:10.468
We now believe that
someone threw prOJectiles

34:10.510 --> 34:13.570
at Mr. Khadem until he died.

34:13.610 --> 34:15.771
He was stoned
to death.

34:15.820 --> 34:19.688
That's... strange.

34:19.720 --> 34:21.358
Yeah.

34:21.390 --> 34:24.188
It's also very, very personal.

34:24.230 --> 34:28.519
Whoever murdered Nadir Khadem
had a visceral hatred for him.

34:30.200 --> 34:32.065
Do you recognize those,
Mr. Afkhami?

34:33.600 --> 34:37.229
They're various e-mails
from Nadir Khadem

34:37.270 --> 34:40.603
to a woman named Yasmin Afkhami.

34:40.640 --> 34:42.107
Your wife.

34:42.140 --> 34:43.698
They're intimate.

34:43.740 --> 34:46.675
The two of them _
were havmg an affair.

34:46.710 --> 34:49.577
You obviously
had your suspicions.

34:49.620 --> 34:51.588
You asked your contact at MI6

34:51.620 --> 34:55.556
to apply his vast intelligence
apparatus to that problem.

34:55.590 --> 34:57.581
Where did you get these?

34:57.620 --> 34:59.554
We've been in touch
with your wife.

34:59.590 --> 35:01.194
HOLMES:
Turns out

35:01.230 --> 35:02.595
she has some residual anger

35:02.630 --> 35:03.858
over the fact that her husband

35:03.900 --> 35:05.720
brutally murdered her lover.

35:05.770 --> 35:07.897
You had to tell her
about it, didn't you?

35:07.930 --> 35:09.329
Or you wouldn't have
been reasserting

35:09.370 --> 35:10.792
your dominance
over her.

35:10.840 --> 35:13.638
You tried to burn _
the clothes you were wearing

35:13.670 --> 35:16.207
when you did it, but your wife

35:16.240 --> 35:19.573
pulled your undershirt
out of the fire.

35:19.610 --> 35:22.374
It has Nadir Khadem's
blood on it.

35:24.850 --> 35:26.818
I want a lawyer.

35:26.850 --> 35:28.386
I'm gonna give you
a little preview

35:28.420 --> 35:29.819
of what he's gonna tell you.

35:29.860 --> 35:34.559
Tell us about your work
as a spy and your mole in MI6.

35:34.600 --> 35:37.797
Or you'll never take a
breath of free air again.

35:42.970 --> 35:46.201
He gave us everything
you described--

35:46.240 --> 35:48.777
how he recruited Sherrington,
how he paid him.

35:48.810 --> 35:50.835
and what they talked about.

35:50.880 --> 35:52.939
Your brother
should be in the clear.

35:52.980 --> 35:54.572
Thank you.

35:54.620 --> 35:56.713
A body just landed
in the morgue.

35:56.750 --> 35:58.945
British national.

35:58.990 --> 36:01.379
We need
to get down there.

36:07.790 --> 36:09.451
WATSON:
Sherrington.

36:09.500 --> 36:10.797
How did this happen?

36:10.830 --> 36:13.663
We don't know.
A janitor found the body.

36:13.700 --> 36:15.964
Now, there's no money left
in his wallet, but this

36:16.000 --> 36:17.888
reads too clean
to be a robbery gone wrong.

36:17.940 --> 36:19.635
Somebody executed him.

36:19.670 --> 36:21.774
Given everything
you two just told me,

36:21.810 --> 36:24.608
I have a pretty good idea
who had a motive.

36:24.650 --> 36:26.948
Mycroft is not
a murderer.

36:26.980 --> 36:30.609
Put out a new Finest Message
for Mycroft Holmes.

36:44.770 --> 36:46.169
(sighs heavily)

36:50.040 --> 36:52.804
Tell me you did not
murder that man.

36:52.840 --> 36:56.298
I did not
murder that man.

36:56.340 --> 36:57.932
ButI had a hand.

36:57.980 --> 36:59.675
Explain.

36:59.710 --> 37:01.678
I had a chat with
him yesterday.

37:01.720 --> 37:04.644
He made it very clear that
if you managed to undo him,

37:04.690 --> 37:06.783
there would be
consequences.

37:06.820 --> 37:08.913
He threatened us.

37:14.760 --> 37:16.455
He said there was a letter.

37:16.500 --> 37:18.923
That in the event
of his death or

37:18.970 --> 37:22.030
arrest, it would be sent

37:22.070 --> 37:25.767
to certain parties
within Le Milieu.

37:25.810 --> 37:27.766
He planned to burn me.

37:27.810 --> 37:31.302
Tell them I was
British intelligence.

37:31.350 --> 37:33.671
He also made it very clear
that you two

37:33.710 --> 37:36.019
would be caught
in the crossfire.

37:36.050 --> 37:38.041
We can take care of
ourselves, you know that.

37:38.080 --> 37:41.049
You don't know
these men, Sherlock.

37:41.090 --> 37:43.012
Not like I do.

37:43.060 --> 37:46.325
So if you didn't kill
Sherrington, who did?

37:48.060 --> 37:50.620
Bit of luck, you introducing
me to your friends

37:50.660 --> 37:52.628
at the NSA the other week.

37:52.670 --> 37:53.921
Agent McNally?

37:53.970 --> 37:57.337
I told you-- I was
a clearinghouse for MI6.

37:57.370 --> 37:59.406
I stored facts;
facts which

37:59.440 --> 38:02.079
were as valuable
to the National Security Agency

38:02.110 --> 38:03.771
as they were to MI6.

38:03.810 --> 38:06.745
After my talk with Sherrington,
I went to them.

38:06.780 --> 38:08.748
I made a deal.

38:08.780 --> 38:11.647
Wait a second-- are you saying
that they killed him?

38:11.690 --> 38:14.045
More like played him
at his own game.

38:14.090 --> 38:16.684
They had their own
contacts at Le Milieu,

38:16.720 --> 38:18.017
which I suspected all along.

38:18.060 --> 38:20.824
They made certain parties

38:20.860 --> 38:23.852
in that organization aware
of MI6's infiltration.

38:23.900 --> 38:26.767
And, in turn, Le Milieu

38:26.800 --> 38:29.598
made an example of Sherrington.

38:29.640 --> 38:31.562
You're not making any sense.
If they know about him,

38:31.610 --> 38:33.066
then they know about you.
They'll come after you,

38:33.110 --> 38:35.078
just like he wanted them to.

38:35.110 --> 38:37.772
Well, as it turns out, Joan,

38:37.810 --> 38:39.801
I'm already dead.

38:39.850 --> 38:42.739
What're you talking about?

38:42.780 --> 38:46.079
He means the NSA has
agreed to fake his demise.

38:48.860 --> 38:51.556
There_was
an aCCIdent

38:51.590 --> 38:55.026
at Diogenes,
a little while ago.

38:55.060 --> 38:58.518
A fire broke out in the kitchen.

38:58.570 --> 38:59.889
When the smoke clears,

38:59.930 --> 39:02.592
the body of a man will be found.

39:02.640 --> 39:04.096
A man about my size.

39:04.140 --> 39:07.064
A man in possession

39:07.110 --> 39:09.829
of my personal effects.

39:12.010 --> 39:14.001
The blaze, of course,
will disguise the fact

39:14.050 --> 39:15.711
that he's a cadaver.

39:15.750 --> 39:18.981
But if you're
supposed to be dead...

39:19.020 --> 39:20.749
He can't stay
in New York.

39:20.790 --> 39:22.781
Nor can he go to
London. Or Rome.

39:22.820 --> 39:25.721
Or anywhere else he's
had dealings with Le Milieu.

39:25.760 --> 39:27.978
He needs to disappear.

39:28.030 --> 39:30.089
Probably forever.

39:30.130 --> 39:33.566
I'm so sorry, Joan.

39:33.600 --> 39:36.467
Sherlock and I were
working on this, you...

39:36.500 --> 39:38.502
you knew that.

39:38.540 --> 39:41.771
I did what I had to do.

39:52.990 --> 39:54.685
Lazy.

39:54.720 --> 39:55.982
Stupid.

39:56.020 --> 39:57.954
Sherlock...
Watson's right.

39:57.990 --> 40:00.026
We could fix this.
But that would require

40:00.060 --> 40:02.119
hard work... effort.

40:02.160 --> 40:05.960
I can't believe I
came to you last night,

40:06.000 --> 40:09.060
asking your forgiveness.

40:09.100 --> 40:12.069
You are the same
self-absorbed sloth...

40:17.080 --> 40:19.776
I love you, brother.

40:25.890 --> 40:27.881
This last year...

40:29.890 --> 40:31.881
...it's been a gift.

40:45.970 --> 40:48.973
WATSON:
Is that a month to
month lease, then?

40:49.010 --> 40:51.228
Yes, that's right.

40:51.280 --> 40:54.204
I-I would like to see the
apartment as soon as p055ible.

40:54.250 --> 40:56.912
Yes, one person.

40:56.950 --> 40:59.919
No pets.

41:31.590 --> 41:33.046
Mr. Holmes.

41:35.620 --> 41:38.180
I was wondering if we might
talk for a moment.

41:44.230 --> 41:47.597
I was sorry to hear
about your brother.

41:47.630 --> 41:49.996
I assume by now you've been

41:50.040 --> 41:52.565
apprised of the arrest
of Julian Afkhami.

41:52.610 --> 41:55.204
He was conspiring
with Sherrington, not Mycroft.

41:55.240 --> 41:57.128
Just as I know
that Mr. Sherrington

41:57.180 --> 41:58.909
was subsequently murdered.

41:58.950 --> 42:01.748
Good riddance to bad rubbish.

42:01.780 --> 42:04.214
I only wish he'd been slotted

42:04.250 --> 42:06.582
before he got to your brother.

42:06.620 --> 42:08.759
Several days ago,

42:08.790 --> 42:11.987
Mr. Sherrington made me
an offer of employment.

42:12.030 --> 42:14.828
He thought I could be
of great assistance to MI6.

42:14.860 --> 42:16.225
I'm just curious--

42:16.260 --> 42:17.921
was this the attempt
of a criminal

42:17.960 --> 42:19.097
to keep his enemy close,

42:19.130 --> 42:22.588
or was he acting on orders?

42:22.640 --> 42:24.858
It's hard to know now
what Sherrington

42:24.910 --> 42:27.162
thought he'd gain from it.

42:27.210 --> 42:29.303
But...

42:29.340 --> 42:31.945
the offer came from me.

42:31.980 --> 42:34.278
Well, in that case,

42:34.310 --> 42:36.312
I'd very much
like to take you up on it.
