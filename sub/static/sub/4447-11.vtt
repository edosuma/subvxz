00:02.667 --> 00:04.166
You sure school's
worth all this?

00:04.166 --> 00:05.333
Dan, I'm going to graduate
pass the bar up north

00:05.333 --> 00:07.125
and work in DA's office.

00:08.542 --> 00:09.792
You're applying
for a scholarship?

00:09.792 --> 00:11.458
I have one now for
cheerleading.

00:11.458 --> 00:12.792
- Cheerleading?
- Oh.

00:12.792 --> 00:14.208
- Hello, Marti.
- Welcome to cheer town.

00:14.208 --> 00:16.959
I need two pre-law students
to help me.

00:16.959 --> 00:20.500
A man was sentenced
to life in prison
for a minor burglary.

00:20.500 --> 00:22.583
My laptop was stolen
from my dorm room.

00:22.583 --> 00:24.667
Hey, Lewis ,
have you seen my laptop?

00:24.667 --> 00:26.125
I think somebody's
been in here.

00:26.125 --> 00:29.166
No, you're not getting this,
this is a warning
from Overton.

00:29.166 --> 00:31.042
You're not actually
planning on flying

00:31.042 --> 00:32.583
'at this Mem-Chris event,
right?'

00:32.583 --> 00:34.458
- Of course I am.
- What about the baby?

00:34.458 --> 00:36.667
This performance
gets us to nationals.

00:36.667 --> 00:38.041
'I don't have a choice.'

00:38.041 --> 00:40.000

there was gonna be'

00:41.000 --> 00:42.834
'so many people with cameras.'

00:42.834 --> 00:45.084
What's your Hellcat family
gonna say when they find out?

00:45.084 --> 00:46.500
We're gonna make damn sure
they don't find out.

00:46.500 --> 00:49.166
Did you ever tell your mom
you were in love with me?

00:49.166 --> 00:51.542
No.

00:51.542 --> 00:53.166
I mean, maybe...yeah.

00:53.166 --> 00:55.084
(Dan)
'We need to talk
about what happened.'

00:55.084 --> 00:56.166
(Marti)
'Nothing happened.'

00:56.166 --> 00:57.750
You're dating my roommate,
I'm not gonna

00:57.750 --> 00:59.041
let a stupid mistake hurt her.

00:59.041 --> 01:01.000
It didn't feel like
a mistake to me.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.750
- I need some space.
- Space?

01:02.750 --> 01:05.458
- What does that mean?
- You and me, apart.

01:05.458 --> 01:07.750
Why, did I do something wrong?

01:07.750 --> 01:10.333
I may not be fit

01:53.375 --> 01:54.959
But you're packing right now.

01:54.959 --> 01:57.167
I want my head clear
for sectionals.

01:57.167 --> 01:59.250
Getting the packing out
of the way allows me
to maintain focus.

01:59.250 --> 02:01.208
But you do concede
it's a little strange.

02:01.208 --> 02:02.959
I concede nothing, okay,
I've got a lot weighing

02:02.959 --> 02:04.875
on my mind right now.

02:04.875 --> 02:07.209
It's the first night of
the barbecue festival, ladies.

02:07.209 --> 02:08.750
- 'You interested?'
- No, thanks.

02:08.750 --> 02:10.084
Oh, come on, Savannah.

02:10.084 --> 02:12.333
Greasy meat and grown men
in pig masks.

02:12.333 --> 02:13.583
It doesn't get
better than that.

02:13.583 --> 02:15.750
I'm not interested, okay?

02:21.542 --> 02:23.917
Rain check, Frankie,
maybe we'll go another night.

02:23.917 --> 02:26.500
You know, it lasts all week.

02:26.500 --> 02:29.167
We're packing
for sectionals right now.

02:29.167 --> 02:30.041
But that's in two days.

02:30.041 --> 02:33.333
I know the timetable, thanks.

02:36.417 --> 02:39.125
Start talking, now.

02:41.542 --> 02:42.875
[sighs]

02:44.083 --> 02:45.917
I hit Dan.

02:45.917 --> 02:48.166
- I'm sorry.
- I slapped him, actually.

02:50.166 --> 02:52.042
Why?

02:52.792 --> 02:54.375
He broke up
with me last night.

02:55.792 --> 02:57.792
Oh, Savannah.

02:57.792 --> 03:00.041
I don't really understand
what happened.

03:00.041 --> 03:03.834
He said he wasn't relationship
material and he apologized.

03:03.834 --> 03:06.542
Which is weird because
he didn't do anything wrong.

03:06.542 --> 03:10.000
I just wish I could
talk to him about it.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.209
Marti, I don't know,
what I did.

03:13.209 --> 03:15.708
I'm sure you didn't
do anything wrong.

03:15.708 --> 03:17.750
Give him some time.

03:17.750 --> 03:20.000
He'll come around, okay?

03:30.834 --> 03:33.084
What did you do, idiot?

03:34.959 --> 03:36.875
And good health
to you as well.

03:39.125 --> 03:41.000
You hungry?

03:41.000 --> 03:43.375
I told you this wasn't
sittin' well.

03:43.375 --> 03:45.917
I don't like being a liar.

03:45.917 --> 03:48.917
I can't stay with Savannah,
without full disclosure.

03:48.917 --> 03:51.583
You're not suggesting telling
her you and I hooked up.

03:51.583 --> 03:52.750
That would be a disaster.

03:52.750 --> 03:54.041
Uh, we're at impasse, then.

03:54.041 --> 03:55.708
No, no, no impasse.

03:55.708 --> 03:56.917
You two are good together.

03:56.917 --> 03:58.917
You need to call her
and make this right.

03:58.917 --> 04:00.083
We have talked about this.

04:00.083 --> 04:02.417
You are the center
of the universe, aren't you?

04:02.417 --> 04:05.084
It's all about Marti,
all the time.

04:05.084 --> 04:07.917
Right down to wanting to force
two of her best friends

04:07.917 --> 04:09.417
to carry on a relationship

04:09.417 --> 04:10.583
even though one of them

04:10.583 --> 04:11.708
is completely taken

04:11.708 --> 04:13.750
with someone else.

04:13.750 --> 04:15.708
Now, don't say that.

04:15.708 --> 04:17.166
[sighs]

04:17.166 --> 04:19.041
Please.

04:19.875 --> 04:22.125
Let's just get back to normal.

04:24.375 --> 04:26.208
Okay.

04:26.208 --> 04:28.625
Hey, it's raining, it's cold.

04:28.625 --> 04:31.000
It's a perfect day
for a funeral.

04:32.209 --> 04:34.041
It's also a good day
for the truth.

04:35.667 --> 04:38.458
When I'm near you,
and I'm not stifling the urge

04:38.458 --> 04:41.291
to strangle you
like I am right now..

04:41.291 --> 04:44.583
...all I can think about
is being with you.

04:45.875 --> 04:48.583
Holding you, kissing you,
the whole..

04:48.583 --> 04:51.083
Unseemly pompatus of love.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
That doesn't work for us, Dan.

05:00.125 --> 05:02.291
Remember the first time,
you disappeared.

05:02.291 --> 05:04.291
I wasn't ready then.

05:06.834 --> 05:09.208
You and me work, M.

05:10.166 --> 05:11.583
As friends.

05:11.583 --> 05:13.917
I can't settle for that.

05:15.166 --> 05:17.458
You're starting to make this
feel like an ultimatum.

05:17.458 --> 05:20.125
Good, then I'm doing it right.

05:21.083 --> 05:25.458
Forget the past,
forget Savannah and Lewis.

05:25.458 --> 05:29.084
Right here, right now,
you tell me the truth.

05:31.125 --> 05:33.375
I'm all in.

05:35.834 --> 05:38.125
Where are you?

05:46.834 --> 05:48.375
I'm not where
you want me to be.

05:55.667 --> 05:57.250
Well, there we have it.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.084
- I gotta get back to work.
- Dan.

06:08.458 --> 06:11.042
Dan.

06:11.042 --> 06:13.250
[thunder rumbling]

06:20.959 --> 06:22.333
He turned his back on me.

06:22.333 --> 06:24.333
And he just walked off.

06:24.333 --> 06:26.500
Good for him.

06:26.500 --> 06:28.000
What, you're taking his side?

06:28.000 --> 06:30.500
He has been your boyfriend
without benefits

06:30.500 --> 06:31.834
for way too long.

06:31.834 --> 06:33.708
See, I don't consider this
supportive.

06:33.708 --> 06:35.417
Men have two brains.

06:35.417 --> 06:37.792
Unfortunately, they only
have enough blood

06:37.792 --> 06:38.959
to use one of them at a time

06:38.959 --> 06:41.667
which is when all
the problems pop up.

06:41.667 --> 06:43.583
Now, it seems that our boy Dan

06:43.583 --> 06:45.125
when he's around you..

06:45.125 --> 06:49.667
...he performs
all the functions
of a close friend.

06:49.667 --> 06:51.208
Blood's where it belongs.

06:51.208 --> 06:53.000
Then there's other times
when he's around you

06:53.000 --> 06:56.125
and the blood flows
to his other brain.

06:56.125 --> 06:59.708
Now, men have no control
over this function.

06:59.708 --> 07:00.917
It's physiological.

07:00.917 --> 07:02.834
Did you major in
junk science, mom?

07:02.834 --> 07:05.583
Interrupting only makes
this last longer.

07:05.583 --> 07:07.000
Now, as I was saying

07:07.000 --> 07:10.125
Dan is finally listening
to his body

07:10.125 --> 07:13.041
and it is yelling at him
to be your boyfriend.

07:13.041 --> 07:15.042
- With full benefits.
- We can't.

07:15.042 --> 07:16.834
Why the hell not?

07:16.834 --> 07:20.333
We tried once
and he took off
for six months.

07:20.333 --> 07:21.917
Oh, boo-hoo.

07:21.917 --> 07:23.792
He came back, didn't he?

07:23.792 --> 07:25.708
As a friend,
that's how I learned

07:25.708 --> 07:28.750
that friends stick around
and boyfriends come and go.

07:28.750 --> 07:30.084
I could have told you that.

07:30.084 --> 07:32.291
I lost Dan once,
I'm not losing him again.

07:32.291 --> 07:33.917
Honey..

07:33.917 --> 07:36.000
..you just did.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.458
You don't know what
you're talking about.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.875
He will call, he always does.

07:59.917 --> 08:02.125
I'm just wiped out, that's it.

08:02.125 --> 08:03.417
I'll be fine once
sectionals is over

08:03.417 --> 08:06.084
and everything's
back to normal.

08:06.084 --> 08:07.917

08:07.917 --> 08:10.083
Yeah, yeah.

What did I say?

08:19.000 --> 08:21.333
I don't do that,
what did I say?

08:22.167 --> 08:23.375
You suck.

08:23.375 --> 08:26.125
Hey, everyone,
sorry to intrude
on your day off.

08:26.125 --> 08:27.542
What do you mean "Sorry?"

08:27.542 --> 08:29.375
The time-honored tradition
is a privilege.

08:29.375 --> 08:32.582
They should mark it on their
calendars every year.

08:32.582 --> 08:33.833
Like income tax day.

08:33.833 --> 08:35.457
I hope you're
that entertaining
for the boosters.

08:35.457 --> 08:38.958
Um, what's with
the fancy envelopes?

08:38.958 --> 08:41.500
Well, you all are,
well, the ladies are..

08:41.500 --> 08:44.583
...about to take part
in a grand Lancer tradition.

08:44.583 --> 08:46.083

08:46.083 --> 08:47.500
the gold level boosters

08:47.500 --> 08:49.291
tell me that the Hellcats
delivering their

08:49.291 --> 08:52.250
season football tickets
is the highlight
of their year.

08:52.250 --> 08:54.042
(Vanessa)
'We go to their
place of business'

08:54.042 --> 08:56.125
have some wine
and cheese, schmooze.

08:56.125 --> 08:57.959
Move onto the next booster.

08:57.959 --> 09:00.834
But, just the female
cheerleaders.

09:00.834 --> 09:02.375
What are we, Hooter girls?

09:02.375 --> 09:05.291
The boosters serve up,
really nice snacks.

09:05.291 --> 09:08.959
What, am I the only one here
who feels exploited?

09:08.959 --> 09:10.542
Ms. Perkins, is it?

09:10.542 --> 09:11.792
As in perky?

09:11.792 --> 09:13.083
Like cheerleading.

09:13.083 --> 09:15.417
Before you dump
on a time-honored tradition

09:15.417 --> 09:16.750
you might want
to remember that

09:16.750 --> 09:18.500
the booster donations pay for

09:18.500 --> 09:20.000
your scholarship.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.041
This is just a simple
thank you to them.

09:23.041 --> 09:25.792
So I expect to see
nothing less than
the Hellcats spirit

09:25.792 --> 09:29.333
which, well, you're all
supposed to be famous for.

09:29.333 --> 09:31.792
Make me and Lancer proud.

09:33.041 --> 09:34.375
We'll split up
into small groups.

09:34.375 --> 09:35.834
'We'll cover as much ground'

09:35.834 --> 09:37.708
as quickly as possible, okay.

09:37.708 --> 09:39.583
This half is team one.

09:39.583 --> 09:42.083
This half, team two.

'Overton's furniture
warehouse.'

09:43.667 --> 09:45.834
Could you not loom
over my shoulder?

09:47.417 --> 09:49.000
What's with the face,
you got something against

09:49.000 --> 09:51.917
furniture wholesalers?

09:51.917 --> 09:53.875
No.

09:53.875 --> 09:55.959
No problem.

09:55.959 --> 09:57.166
So I think I've got
a way to find out

09:57.166 --> 09:59.291
if Bobby Overton
took our laptops.

09:59.291 --> 10:01.167
See, the Hellcats
deliver tickets

10:01.167 --> 10:03.166
every year to big boosters

10:03.166 --> 10:04.959
and I got assigned
to his store.

10:04.959 --> 10:08.167
So once I'm there, I can
break away and snoop around.

10:08.167 --> 10:09.542
He'll recognize you.

10:09.542 --> 10:12.000
Well, I'll be in a big group
of other cheerleaders.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.084
Dressed in bare midriff
tops and mini skirts?

10:15.084 --> 10:17.500
Yes, that does
sound inconspicuous.

10:17.500 --> 10:19.208
Hey, look,
I need my laptop back.

10:19.208 --> 10:20.667
'This is worth a shot.'

10:20.667 --> 10:22.417
When they make our story
into a Hollywood movie

10:22.417 --> 10:24.875
I'm sure the cheerleader
infiltration scene

10:24.875 --> 10:27.542
will be a real tour de force
for Dakota Fanning.

10:27.542 --> 10:29.625
- What?
- 'I'm doomed to be miscast..'

10:29.625 --> 10:32.667
Unless a young Orson Welles
suddenly becomes available.

10:32.667 --> 10:34.375
I will have a spritzer.

10:35.917 --> 10:37.875
There you go.

10:37.875 --> 10:39.875
So, did you read the post
on Draft Watch today?

10:39.875 --> 10:42.959
They are, uh, predicting that
I could go early second round

10:42.959 --> 10:45.084
if I declare
for the NFL draft.

10:45.084 --> 10:46.458
Why are they even ranking you?

10:46.458 --> 10:48.792
You still have a full year of
playing eligibility at Lancer.

10:48.792 --> 10:52.084
Because I'm good, Alice
and they know I'm good.

10:52.084 --> 10:54.792
So, are you gonna
declare for the draft?

10:54.792 --> 10:57.333
Well, I'd like to, I mean,
hell, if I went pro now

10:57.333 --> 10:59.708
I'd probably get a few
million in signing bonuses.

10:59.708 --> 11:02.625
I could buy you some
24 carat gold pompoms.

11:02.625 --> 11:05.542
You'd be riding pine
for a long time in the NFL.

11:05.542 --> 11:07.375
Honestly, I don't mind
riding pine, I mean

11:07.375 --> 11:09.041
Tom Brady, was
a sixth round draft pick

11:09.041 --> 11:11.125
and look at him now.

11:11.125 --> 11:13.084
True.

11:13.084 --> 11:14.875
I guess the big question is

11:14.875 --> 11:17.708
are you ready to leave Lancer?

11:17.708 --> 11:19.792
Why? Would you miss me?

11:19.792 --> 11:23.834
Jakey, if this is
good for you, then...
you should do it.

11:26.208 --> 11:28.250
You know, a guy could
really get used to you.

11:28.250 --> 11:30.875
Well, if you're gonna
long distance date someone

11:30.875 --> 11:32.834
it might as well
be an NFL star.

11:32.834 --> 11:34.583
Hmm.

11:36.208 --> 11:39.000
Come on, let's go.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Bye.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.500
(Morgan)
'Try not to
embarrass yourself.'

11:42.500 --> 11:44.083
Go!

11:44.083 --> 11:46.375
[instrumental music]

11:48.084 --> 11:50.000
I'll do your laundry
for two weeks.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.333
This is weird.

11:51.333 --> 11:52.959
Okay, folded and put away.

11:52.959 --> 11:55.458
- Two weeks?
- I'm in.

11:55.458 --> 11:57.917
Why do you want to get into
this guy's office anyway?

11:57.917 --> 11:59.750
It's a long story,
it has to do with my law case

11:59.750 --> 12:01.959
and I think he's the guy
who stole my laptop.

12:01.959 --> 12:03.875
And what if we get caught?

12:03.875 --> 12:05.042
I'll worry about that, okay?

12:05.042 --> 12:06.917
Just keep
the boosters distracted

12:06.917 --> 12:08.250
and no laundry for two weeks.

12:08.250 --> 12:10.708
Including hand washing
of the delicates?

12:10.708 --> 12:13.458
- Mine, too.
- Ugh, fine.

12:13.458 --> 12:15.291
Alrighty then.

12:15.291 --> 12:17.583
(Bob)
'Well, here we go, gentlemen.'

12:17.583 --> 12:19.792

we've been waiting for.'

12:19.792 --> 12:21.500
[laughs]

12:21.500 --> 12:24.708
Okay, the first
lucky man is, uh..

12:24.708 --> 12:26.542
Malcolm, right over there.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.084
Whoo!

12:29.084 --> 12:31.625

12:36.625 --> 12:39.792
Alright, and, now, uh,

12:54.667 --> 12:55.959

12:55.959 --> 12:58.250
- Okay, darling.
- Okay.

12:58.250 --> 13:01.041
Listen, I keep
the good stuff in my office.

13:04.417 --> 13:05.542
(Marti)
'Yes.'

13:05.542 --> 13:06.792
One down, one to go.

13:06.792 --> 13:09.167
Enjoying yourself?

13:11.084 --> 13:12.834
Excuse me for a second.

13:16.875 --> 13:19.209
Mr. Overton.

13:21.125 --> 13:23.083
We came all this way for you

13:23.083 --> 13:25.625
'and you're not even
paying attention to us.'

13:25.625 --> 13:27.000
Do you have any idea
what that can do

13:27.000 --> 13:29.792
'to a young girl's
self esteem?'

13:29.792 --> 13:31.625
I'll be right back.

13:35.125 --> 13:36.000
Okay.

[cellphone rings]

[instrumental music]

14:15.792 --> 14:16.875
I checked the printer cache.

14:16.875 --> 14:18.166
The only thing
Overton printed off

14:18.166 --> 14:19.458
was from my legal folder.

14:19.458 --> 14:20.542
Great.

14:20.542 --> 14:22.209
He's just interested
in the three strikes

14:22.209 --> 14:24.125
and Travis case file.

14:24.125 --> 14:25.708
This is progress.
Why are you looking so glum?

14:25.708 --> 14:27.375
I'm glad we're getting
closer to Overton

14:27.375 --> 14:28.917
but my laptop's still missing.

14:28.917 --> 14:31.583
And I really wish,
I'd had time to look for both.

14:31.583 --> 14:33.041
I don't have
the cash to replace it.

14:33.041 --> 14:35.125
It's getting kind of hard
working on Travis's case

14:35.125 --> 14:37.125
on borrowed computers.

14:37.125 --> 14:39.708
Perhaps you could sneak back
into the furniture store

14:39.708 --> 14:41.917
disguised as
a stripper gram dancer.

14:41.917 --> 14:44.041
- You see that sarcasm there?
- Or a birthday party clown.

14:44.041 --> 14:45.750
That's the reason
you don't have more friends.

14:45.750 --> 14:47.209
Friends are overrated.

14:47.209 --> 14:49.667
Friends don't get you
into law school.

14:49.667 --> 14:50.959
You probably think
you and I are friends.

14:50.959 --> 14:52.625
- I don't, actually.
- But we're not.

14:52.625 --> 14:54.083
You and I are a marriage
of convenience.

14:54.083 --> 14:56.083
- We're not a marriage--
- All our sexy banter.

14:56.083 --> 14:58.125
The banter stops if we're
ever on opposite sides.

14:58.125 --> 14:59.792
I will cut your throat
in a heartbeat.

14:59.792 --> 15:02.583
- What?
- Legally speaking.

15:02.583 --> 15:04.208
Okay, wow, I'm, I'm done here.

15:04.208 --> 15:06.417
- Lawyers can't
afford friends.
- Done listening.

15:06.417 --> 15:09.250
That's why they make
the shark jokes.

15:09.250 --> 15:12.084

- Hey.

15:16.208 --> 15:17.792
Thanks, for seeing me.

15:17.792 --> 15:20.542
- So, I saw Draft Watch.
- Yeah.

15:20.542 --> 15:23.125
Early second round, not bad.

15:23.125 --> 15:24.834
Next year will be even better.

15:24.834 --> 15:27.917
Well, I was, uh, I was hoping
we could discuss my options.

15:27.917 --> 15:31.542
- Options?
- I'm considering going pro.

15:32.917 --> 15:35.000
Leave Lancer
for a greener gridirons.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.125
Is that it?

15:36.125 --> 15:38.583
Well, got to think
about my future.

15:38.583 --> 15:39.708
Me, too.

15:39.708 --> 15:40.834
Only the future I think about

15:40.834 --> 15:42.375
is this athletic program.

15:42.375 --> 15:44.834
You know I care about Lancer.

15:44.834 --> 15:47.000
But this is my life.

15:48.959 --> 15:50.625
What would that life
be like right now

15:50.625 --> 15:52.375
if it weren't for me?

15:52.375 --> 15:53.708
'I took
enormous risks with you.'

15:53.708 --> 15:54.917
Put my neck on the line

15:54.917 --> 15:57.375
but that's what
family does for family.

15:57.375 --> 15:59.583
We take care of our own.

16:01.542 --> 16:03.167
You know I think of you
like a son, Jakey.

16:03.167 --> 16:04.458
You know that, right?

16:04.458 --> 16:08.208
- Yes, sir, I do.
- Lancer needs you.

16:10.625 --> 16:12.917
I need you.

16:15.166 --> 16:16.750
I'm sorry, but I'm

16:16.750 --> 16:19.125
ready to declare
for the draft.

16:23.291 --> 16:25.583
[beeping]

16:32.500 --> 16:33.834
What is that?

16:33.834 --> 16:34.959
I kept a little souvenir

16:34.959 --> 16:36.834
of our adventure together.

16:42.417 --> 16:44.125
Why don't you
watch that video?

16:44.125 --> 16:45.417
Then we'll discuss
your future

16:45.417 --> 16:47.834
with a little more
perspective.

16:57.084 --> 16:59.625
I know this is
my third message.

16:59.625 --> 17:01.125
Okay, maybe fourth.

17:01.125 --> 17:03.250
No, you know,
the first one,
I got cut off

17:03.250 --> 17:05.040
so, the first and second one
are really the same message.

17:05.040 --> 17:09.208
But I just want to say that
I'm sorry for slapping you.

17:09.208 --> 17:12.041
I don't know
what came over me.

17:12.041 --> 17:15.290
Maybe you can call me to
tell me that you got this.

17:15.290 --> 17:17.583
Okay, hope you're having fun.

17:19.834 --> 17:21.625

- No.

frown upside down.

distance between
two people is a smile.

- Will you knock it off?
- On positive outcomes only.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.834
- Seriously,
I'm gonna slap you.
- You know what?

17:35.834 --> 17:39.083
You're asking for it.
Give me your hand.

32:33.084 --> 32:35.084
it'd be my pleasure
to take you home.

32:36.667 --> 32:38.542
We can spend
all night together.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.458
Watch the sunrise.

32:46.375 --> 32:48.500
I don't think my boyfriend
would like that too much.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.417
Boyfriend?
Doesn't matter to me.

32:51.792 --> 32:54.458
I'm really sorry.
I have to go.

32:58.834 --> 32:59.917
Gotcha.

33:03.166 --> 33:04.875
I'm just playing with you.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
That's not funny.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.167
Come on, let me go.

33:10.167 --> 33:11.708
See, you're not playing fair.

33:11.708 --> 33:14.000
You can't just come out here
and get me all worked up

33:14.000 --> 33:15.209
And then bail on me.

33:16.750 --> 33:20.250
I wasn't thinking.
Please let me go.

33:20.250 --> 33:22.542
It's not right.

33:25.166 --> 33:26.250
Get off me.

33:26.250 --> 33:28.209
[grunting]
Get off!

33:28.792 --> 33:29.917
'Get off!'

33:29.917 --> 33:31.917
Hey, help me! Hurry up.

33:31.917 --> 33:33.291
We're kind of busy in here.
Please come back another time.

33:33.291 --> 33:35.084
No, I'm serious.
It's an emergency.

33:35.084 --> 33:38.583
Please roll your
window down. Come on,
roll your window down.

33:38.583 --> 33:40.000
- What do you want?
- Savannah, look away.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.959
'Look away, look away.'

33:41.959 --> 33:43.084
Get out of the car.

33:43.084 --> 33:45.084
Get out. Come on.
Get out of the car.

33:46.083 --> 33:47.458
Come on, hurry up.

33:50.125 --> 33:51.542
Thank you. Thank you.

33:58.708 --> 34:00.166
Everyone kept telling me
to lighten up, have fun.

34:00.166 --> 34:03.084
I-I thought random hooking up
is what people do to have fun.

34:03.084 --> 34:04.250
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

34:04.250 --> 34:06.125
Savannah,
you can't think like that.

34:06.125 --> 34:07.834
I can't do anything right.

34:07.834 --> 34:09.208
First Dan leaves
and doesn't say why

34:09.208 --> 34:10.333
but it's gotta be me.

34:10.333 --> 34:11.833
No. No, Savannah.

34:11.833 --> 34:14.125
Then when I try
to get over him,

34:14.125 --> 34:16.208
I almost
get date raped.

34:16.208 --> 34:18.041
What is wrong with me, Marti?

34:18.041 --> 34:21.458
I'm stupid and prude
and no one I like
is ever gonna like me.

34:21.458 --> 34:23.542
Savannah,
stop blaming yourself.

34:25.125 --> 34:28.042
I liked Dan so much, Marti.

34:28.042 --> 34:31.625
I hate that who I am
just pushed him away.

34:31.625 --> 34:33.917
Savannah, it's not you.

34:35.500 --> 34:37.417
It's me. It's, um..

34:38.667 --> 34:42.041
It's, it's my fault Dan left.

34:42.041 --> 34:44.166
- No, it's not.
- Yeah.

34:44.166 --> 34:45.667
- Yeah, it is.
- That's crazy.

34:45.667 --> 34:47.792
Savannah, I'm dead serious.

34:50.458 --> 34:51.917
I don't understand.

34:56.833 --> 35:00.959
It's not because he doesn't
have feelings for you.

35:03.625 --> 35:06.125
It's because he thinks
he has feelings for me.

35:08.333 --> 35:09.708
- 'There she is.'
- Why are you saying that?

35:09.708 --> 35:11.917
- 'Hey, Savannah.'
- 'Hey, Savannah.'

35:13.875 --> 35:17.291
Marti, tell me.

35:26.917 --> 35:31.375
Marti, tell me now.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.667
Just say it, Marti.

35:37.708 --> 35:39.375
One night, last week.

35:42.667 --> 35:44.083
Dan and I were, um..

35:46.333 --> 35:47.959
We were together.

35:52.792 --> 35:56.917
You mean physically?

35:59.209 --> 36:00.625
So you've both been
lying this whole time?

36:00.625 --> 36:02.708
No, no, it was,
it was a mistake.

36:02.708 --> 36:03.875
We were both drunk
and everybody--

36:03.875 --> 36:05.125
Just shut up.

36:05.125 --> 36:06.542
Look, I don't want
you to think that
it was something--

36:06.542 --> 36:08.166
No, I said shut up!

36:13.333 --> 36:17.875
I think you should
find another place to
stay in Cheer Town..

36:20.167 --> 36:21.125
...permanently.

36:23.959 --> 36:25.917
(Marti)
'Savannah, I'm sorry.'

36:25.917 --> 36:27.041
Lewis, Lewis, Lewis,
let me explain.

36:27.041 --> 36:29.792
(Lewis)
'No, I already heard, Marti.'

36:29.792 --> 36:31.208
You made a mistake.

36:33.291 --> 36:35.291
I made one of those with you.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.792
[sobbing]

36:53.042 --> 36:54.875
(Bobby)
What do you know
about a cheerleader

36:54.875 --> 36:57.000
name of Marti Perkins?

36:59.208 --> 37:00.834
The name ring a bell?

37:03.167 --> 37:05.792
Well, Bobby, what do I
need to know about her?

37:07.250 --> 37:11.209
She's still poking
her nose into the Travis
Guthrie situation.

37:16.583 --> 37:19.125
[indistinct chatter]

37:26.084 --> 37:28.333
Hey, uh,
do you know
Dan Patch?

37:28.333 --> 37:29.834
Yeah, sure. Good dude.

37:29.834 --> 37:31.792
Quit yesterday, though.

37:31.792 --> 37:33.583
'Cleaned out his locker,
