Tell Armando I'm sorry I haven't
been more welcoming to him.

16:41.410 --> 16:43.810
_

16:43.860 --> 16:44.910
Tell him he's a great guy.

16:46.350 --> 16:48.650
_

16:48.710 --> 16:50.680
And he can stay
as long as he wants.

16:50.700 --> 16:52.900
_

16:52.980 --> 16:54.580
We forgive you.

16:54.620 --> 16:56.500
You sure? Maybe I can give him
a little hug or something.

16:56.500 --> 16:59.270
No, it's too much.

16:59.320 --> 17:00.900
Bye-bye.

17:02.160 --> 17:03.230
Hey!

17:03.240 --> 17:05.339
Okay, I've had enough.
I need to know.

17:05.400 --> 17:07.190
Who is this precious Spencer?

17:07.220 --> 17:08.770
Oh, god.
How do you know about Spencer?

17:08.780 --> 17:09.690
So you admit it.

17:09.740 --> 17:11.040
You <i> are</i> having an affair.

17:11.089 --> 17:12.960
- What?
- It's the braces, isn't it?

17:13.010 --> 17:14.650
I've driven you to stray.
I'm hideous.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.030
Cam, you're acting crazy.

17:16.079 --> 17:18.250
Am I?
Mitchell...

17:18.280 --> 17:20.020
I found the receipt
to The Avian Hotel.

17:20.050 --> 17:21.190
That's pronounced
"ay-vee-Ann."

17:21.220 --> 17:22.190
Well, it sounds seedy.

17:22.190 --> 17:24.119
It is.
It's a kennel for birds.

17:24.160 --> 17:25.339
It's where I picked up George.

17:25.369 --> 17:26.420
There's a George, too?

17:26.480 --> 17:29.110
Calm down.
I'm talking about a cockatoo.

17:29.140 --> 17:31.660
Oh! One or two.
Is that all? How blasé.

17:31.700 --> 17:33.630
Cam, George is a bird,

17:33.670 --> 17:34.630
and Spencer is an old man

17:34.670 --> 17:35.600
I've been hanging out with

17:35.650 --> 17:38.300
at the park, because I...

17:38.590 --> 17:39.630
I got laid off.

17:39.630 --> 17:40.640
You lost your job?

17:40.680 --> 17:41.840
I'm sorry.
I just --

17:41.900 --> 17:44.280
I couldn't tell you
that I was out of work again.

17:44.330 --> 17:46.970
I... I feel like such a loser.

17:46.970 --> 17:48.020
No, please.
My gosh.

17:48.050 --> 17:49.540
As long as
you're not cheating on me,

17:49.570 --> 17:51.290
that's all that matters.

17:51.570 --> 17:53.670
Something will come up.
You're a great lawyer.

17:53.710 --> 17:54.920
Oh, thank you.
I just --

17:54.970 --> 17:57.410
I don't think that we can get
that apartment right now.

17:57.440 --> 17:58.360
Of course we can.

17:58.410 --> 17:59.930
We already
have the down payment.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.720
And you know what?
We could get renters.

18:01.720 --> 18:03.790
We could it into an Airbnb.

18:03.820 --> 18:06.290
Uh... Really?
Different people every week?

18:06.290 --> 18:08.110
How exciting and new.
It'd be like "The Love Boat."

18:08.140 --> 18:09.320
Oh!

18:10.260 --> 18:11.660
Hey, mom, have a second?

18:11.710 --> 18:12.840
Already am.

18:14.720 --> 18:16.300
I wanted to give you a present.

18:16.320 --> 18:17.870
Me? No.

18:17.910 --> 18:19.920
Honey, I want
to give <i> you</i> a present.

18:19.960 --> 18:22.280
That's what I've been
trying to do all day.

18:22.310 --> 18:26.080
You are the last person
who should give me anything.

18:26.110 --> 18:28.050
You got me here.

18:28.050 --> 18:30.370
You got me to graduation,
to Caltech.

18:32.290 --> 18:33.390
You did it.

18:33.420 --> 18:34.470
And you're done.

18:34.520 --> 18:37.360
Thank you, sweetie.
Thank you. I love you.

18:37.410 --> 18:39.630
I want you to go to Europe
with me.

18:39.660 --> 18:40.790
What?!

18:40.850 --> 18:42.600
Yeah.
We'll have a great time.

18:42.630 --> 18:43.650
Cafés, museums.

18:43.700 --> 18:45.870
Plus, Europe is not safe
for teenage girls.

18:45.900 --> 18:47.000
You've seen "Taken."

18:47.000 --> 18:48.600
Could you imagine
dad getting that phone call?

18:49.020 --> 18:51.330
What is his
particular set of skills?

18:51.410 --> 18:52.380
Juggling?

18:52.430 --> 18:54.130
[ Both laugh ]

18:54.160 --> 18:55.780
Hey, dad, can we talk?

18:55.810 --> 18:57.620
- Sure, honey.
- In private?

18:57.650 --> 18:59.580
[ Straining ] Oh, not so hard.
I can't breathe.

18:59.640 --> 19:01.770
[ Laughs ]
Little robot humor.

19:04.840 --> 19:06.730
I noticed you didn't laugh
at my robot joke.

19:06.780 --> 19:07.860
What's going on?

19:07.860 --> 19:10.630
Everyone thinks Beth is so
great, but I think she's crazy.

19:10.670 --> 19:12.130
She's been after me all day.

19:12.130 --> 19:13.870
Why would she be after you?

19:14.330 --> 19:16.630
She thinks
I'm in love with Andy.

19:16.630 --> 19:17.600
Are you?

19:17.650 --> 19:19.520
No.
I mean, I care about him.

19:19.570 --> 19:21.700
He makes me laugh.
I like spending time with him.

19:21.750 --> 19:24.340
Well, do you think about him
when he's not around?

19:24.340 --> 19:26.260
I guess.

19:26.310 --> 19:28.360
Sometimes, I see
something funny and I think,

19:28.410 --> 19:29.740
"oh, Andy would love that.

19:29.780 --> 19:32.080
I wish he were here
so I could share it with him."

19:32.100 --> 19:33.580
But...

19:33.610 --> 19:36.180
Honey, I know I'm just a robot,

19:36.180 --> 19:37.830
but that sounds like love to me.

19:37.880 --> 19:41.690
[ Sighs ]

19:42.120 --> 19:42.860
Well...

19:45.180 --> 19:46.160
Doesn't matter anyway.

19:46.200 --> 19:49.260
He's in love with someone else.

19:49.300 --> 19:50.930
Maybe <i> I'm</i> the crazy one.

19:50.970 --> 19:53.420
[ Knock on door ]

19:54.720 --> 19:58.440
Don't mean to interrupt.
Just came to say goodbye.

19:58.470 --> 19:59.660
Mm-hmm.

19:59.690 --> 20:01.580
Beth and I are going to
take a drive,

20:01.610 --> 20:02.790
try to catch the sunset.

20:02.830 --> 20:05.080
Okay, well, have fun.

20:05.080 --> 20:06.250
Okay.

20:11.120 --> 20:14.720
It's Haley. Haley's the girl.
You love Ha--

20:14.760 --> 20:16.930
[ no audio ]

20:17.460 --> 20:18.500

20:19.130 --> 20:21.420
Come on.
I'll walk you out.

20:22.850 --> 20:24.130
Where are you going?

20:24.140 --> 20:25.600
You guys love each oth--

20:27.570 --> 20:29.660
You're making a huge mistake!

20:31.730 --> 20:32.500
Beth: Ready?

20:32.530 --> 20:33.950
- Bye.
- Bye.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.640
Come back.

20:41.310 --> 20:43.480
Oh, boy.
This is gonna hurt.

20:46.260 --> 20:47.400
Stop!

20:47.430 --> 20:49.230
Oh-ho-ho!

20:49.270 --> 20:51.330
Aaaah!

Can anybody hear me?

21:07.750 --> 21:08.750
Hello?

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
Oh, thank God!

21:12.020 --> 21:14.020
You've gotta help me.
I've been in an accident.

21:14.050 --> 21:16.050
I need you to find my daughter.

21:16.870 --> 21:18.470
Oh, great!
Thank you!

21:18.490 --> 21:19.890
Wha-- what are you doing?

Where are you going?

21:21.140 --> 21:23.140
Where are you taking me?
Put me down!
