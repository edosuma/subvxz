00:24.591 --> 00:26.525
Aah!

00:27.394 --> 00:30.693
Whoa!

02:09.496 --> 02:12.397
Operator, haven't you
been able to get me...

02:12.465 --> 02:16.424
the express office
in Florida yet?

02:16.503 --> 02:19.631
Yes, I know it takes time to
call from London to the States.

02:19.706 --> 02:22.800
But please hurry.
It's terribly important!

02:22.876 --> 02:25.310
Answer that phone.

02:25.378 --> 02:27.539
Answer the bell!

02:27.614 --> 02:29.809
Answer the phone!

02:29.883 --> 02:32.443
- Which do you want me to answer first?
- Both of'em.

02:32.519 --> 02:35.716
Both of'em.
Both of'em!

02:35.788 --> 02:39.849
Hold the line, please.
Thank you.

02:39.926 --> 02:42.326
I'd like to have my
grip, please. Yes, ma'am.

02:42.395 --> 02:45.728
Let me see that.
They came in on the last train.

02:45.798 --> 02:48.460
We haven't unloaded the truck yet.
Go out and get the lady's grip.

02:48.535 --> 02:51.402
Hurry up.

02:51.471 --> 02:55.202
Excuse me, please.

03:03.149 --> 03:07.085
Lady, here's your bag.

03:11.591 --> 03:15.049
What are you trying to do, ruin the
lady's baggage? Where is it? This one.

03:15.128 --> 03:17.426
There you are. I'm sorry. Thank you.

03:17.497 --> 03:19.931
Come on, clean this up.
Straighten it out.

03:19.999 --> 03:22.229
Wilbur, darling,
are you all right?

03:22.302 --> 03:26.261
Sandra, I hurt
my poor little head.

03:26.339 --> 03:28.136
Your head?
Mm-hmm.

03:28.208 --> 03:31.473
Oh, no.

03:31.544 --> 03:33.603
Does this hurt?
Uh-uh.

03:33.680 --> 03:35.978
Does that hurt?
Uh-uh.

03:36.049 --> 03:39.712
Thank heaven. If anything
happened to you, dearest,

03:39.786 --> 03:42.550
I'd never
forgive myself.

03:42.622 --> 03:45.921
That kiss made everything
all better.

03:45.992 --> 03:48.358
You worry about me
an awful lot, don't you?

03:48.428 --> 03:52.626
You mean an awful lot to me. Tell me more.

03:52.699 --> 03:55.497
I will... at dinner tonight. Okay.

03:57.704 --> 04:02.107
Get up and go to work! That is, if
your head doesn't bother you too much.

04:02.175 --> 04:05.042
His head is all right. It is?
But is your head all right?

04:05.111 --> 04:07.739
Certainly. Frankly, I don't get it.

04:07.814 --> 04:09.907
And frankly,
you never will.

04:12.051 --> 04:14.576
I can't understand
that dame.

04:14.654 --> 04:18.420
Of all the guys around here, that classy
dish has to pick out a guy like you.

04:18.491 --> 04:21.459
What's wrong with that? Look at
yourself in the mirror sometime.

04:21.527 --> 04:23.825
Why should I hurt
my own feelings?

04:23.896 --> 04:28.856
Go answer the phone.
I'll pick these up.

04:28.935 --> 04:33.599
Baggage room.

04:33.673 --> 04:37.006
London?
Calling here?

04:37.076 --> 04:39.738
This ain't collect, is it?

04:39.812 --> 04:42.246
Oh, all right.
Put him on.

04:42.315 --> 04:47.685
Hello? Do you have two crates addressed
to the McDougal House of Horrors?

04:47.754 --> 04:50.245
What's the number on the
checks? Never mind that.

04:50.323 --> 04:53.588
Tonight the moon will be full.
I haven't much time.

04:53.660 --> 04:57.061
Listen closely.
I'm flying out of here at dawn.

04:57.130 --> 05:01.157
Under no circumstances are you to
deliver those crates until I arrive.

05:01.234 --> 05:05.398
Understand?
Under...

05:05.471 --> 05:07.632
Under...

05:12.979 --> 05:16.642
Mr. McDougal, will you stop
gargling your throat?

05:40.139 --> 05:44.576
Hey, you'll have to get your dog away from
the phone. I can't hear a word you're sayin'.

05:48.514 --> 05:51.915
You're silly to call me all the way from
London just to have your dog talk to me.

06:00.493 --> 06:04.259
That's great conversation.
The guy growls like a wolf.

06:04.797 --> 06:07.698
The nerve of some people!
What can I do for you, bub?

06:07.767 --> 06:09.894
I have two crates addressed to my House
of Horrors, and I want immediate delivery.

06:11.537 --> 06:14.995
My name's McDougal. McDougal? I just
talked to you on the phone from London.

06:15.074 --> 06:17.599
How'd you get here so fast? They shoot
you out of a cannon? Are you crazy?

06:17.677 --> 06:20.009
I've been here all the time.
Now get me those crates!

06:20.079 --> 06:22.206
How long you been here? Five minutes.

06:22.281 --> 06:24.681
I've been here five years,
you don't see me yelling...

06:24.751 --> 06:28.744
There's the insurance slip and the
bill of lading. Now get me those crates!

06:28.821 --> 06:33.724
Will you please stop yellin'? Come
here. It's impolite to raise your voice.

06:33.793 --> 06:36.728
Chick! Why didn't you give
me these in the first place?

06:36.796 --> 06:39.731
Chi... Chick, this man
wants these crates.

06:39.799 --> 06:42.893
Insured for $20,000.
We better look these up.

06:42.969 --> 06:44.903
Must be valuable. I'll
say they're valuable.

06:44.971 --> 06:46.666
Wilbur?
Yes, Sandra?

06:46.739 --> 06:48.707
He's busy.
Please.

06:48.775 --> 06:51.573
That little fellow's impossible.
Hurry up with those crates!

06:51.644 --> 06:55.842
Do you know what I've got in
there? Haven't the slightest idea.

06:55.915 --> 06:58.782
The greatest attraction the House
of Horrors ever had, that's all.

06:58.851 --> 07:02.810
One of them's a coffin containing the
remains of the original Count Dracula.

07:02.889 --> 07:07.451
The other's the body
of the Frankenstein monster.

07:07.527 --> 07:12.191
That combination's enough to scare the pants...
I mean, shirt right off your back, ain't it?

07:12.265 --> 07:15.098
I don't scare easily. Neither
do I where money's concerned.

07:15.168 --> 07:19.002
I got 'em cheap. European agent
picked my name right out of thin air.

07:19.071 --> 07:21.005
Very interesting.
Yeah.

07:22.341 --> 07:24.639
Mr. McDougal.

07:25.645 --> 07:27.738
Hey, Chick,
here's one.

07:27.814 --> 07:31.181
Darling,
I have to run along.

07:31.250 --> 07:34.481
Something's come up. That means
we'll have to break our date tonight.

07:34.554 --> 07:37.114
It ain't another man, is it?
Of course not.

07:37.190 --> 07:39.124
Silly boy.

07:44.430 --> 07:46.864
Boy, I'm floatin'
on a cloud of love.

07:46.933 --> 07:50.994
You little blimp, I'll let the air
out of you if you don't give me a hand.

07:51.070 --> 07:54.733
You understand that?
Thank you.

07:54.807 --> 07:57.332
Boy, is this kid lost.

07:57.410 --> 08:00.971
Take that rope. Get up on that box
and tie it to that handle up there.

08:01.047 --> 08:02.981
Okay.
Nothing matters no more.

08:03.049 --> 08:06.780
I'm so happy. Go on, get up there!

08:14.193 --> 08:16.127
Here it is.

08:17.530 --> 08:19.896
Hold still now.

08:19.966 --> 08:23.367
Whoa!

08:23.436 --> 08:25.370
Chick!

08:25.438 --> 08:29.204
Stop him! Is he trying to
ruin me? You're insured.

08:29.275 --> 08:32.403
Yes, and if those exhibits are
damaged, I intend to collect.

08:32.477 --> 08:35.640
Whoa!

08:37.616 --> 08:40.177
Well, there you are. Shall
I wrap it up? No, you idiot.

08:40.253 --> 08:43.120
Take those to my House of
Horrors and uncrate them.

08:43.188 --> 08:46.124
If that's the way you handle baggage, I'm
going to have the insurance agent there...

08:46.192 --> 08:48.422
to inspect them
before I accept delivery.

08:48.494 --> 08:51.327
Then it's gonna cost you
overtime because I'm a union man.

08:51.397 --> 08:55.595
I work only 16 hours a day. A union
man only works eight hours a day.

08:55.668 --> 08:58.603
I belong
to two unions!

09:00.206 --> 09:04.006
Get those down to my place! All right.

09:10.616 --> 09:14.450
Hey, Wilbur, here's a key. Open the door.

09:30.770 --> 09:34.365
I'm not gonna like this.
Come on, gimme a hand.

09:34.440 --> 09:36.567
Come on,
get it inside.

09:36.642 --> 09:39.372
Pull it! You want me
to do all the work?

09:42.214 --> 09:45.183
Come on, help me
with it, will ya?

09:49.755 --> 09:52.383
Uh-oh. What's the matter now?

09:52.458 --> 09:54.858
Somebody's got a knife
in my back. Oh, nonsense!

09:54.927 --> 09:57.521
Where's the switch?
Here.

09:59.665 --> 10:01.599
Sandra should
see you now.

10:01.667 --> 10:05.398
Turn around. Look what you're afraid of.

10:05.471 --> 10:08.065
Turn around!

10:12.144 --> 10:16.171
I... Come on, get up on
your feet. It's only a dummy.

10:16.248 --> 10:18.648
Dummy nothin'. It was
smart enough to scare me.

10:18.718 --> 10:22.586
Get ahold of the box.
Go ahead.

10:22.655 --> 10:25.419
Come on,
swing it around.

10:26.459 --> 10:30.293
Help a little bit.!

10:30.363 --> 10:32.558
Oh!
Ah, ah!

10:32.632 --> 10:35.999
You fraidy-cat. These things can't
harm ya. They're made out of wax.

10:36.068 --> 10:38.662
People pay McDougal cash to
come in here and get scared.

10:38.738 --> 10:40.729
I'm cheatin' him. I'm
gettin' scared for nothin'.

10:40.806 --> 10:43.639
Go ahead and push.
Don't knock anything over.

10:43.709 --> 10:47.145
There we are. Now we get the
dolly out from underneath there.

10:47.213 --> 10:50.671
Lift up that end.
Lift it up!

10:50.750 --> 10:53.514
Come on, come on.

10:53.586 --> 10:55.520
There you are.

10:55.588 --> 10:59.285
Put it down, put it down.
Do I have to do all the work?

10:59.358 --> 11:01.223
I'll get it down.
Put it down.

11:01.293 --> 11:04.126
Go ahead.
Now open it up.

11:04.196 --> 11:06.892
I'm going out and get the
other crate. And no back talk!

11:06.966 --> 11:09.628
I've got just two words to
say to you. What is that?

11:09.702 --> 11:11.932
Hurry back.
Aah!

11:21.247 --> 11:25.149
Hello?
Yes, Mr. McDougal.

11:25.217 --> 11:28.914
Yeah, the crates are here.
Wilbur's opening one now.

11:28.988 --> 11:32.048
Mm-hmm.
Everything's all right.

11:32.124 --> 11:34.854
Okay, Mr. McDougal.
Good-bye.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.102
Chick?
Oh, Chi... ick!

11:45.171 --> 11:46.729
What's the matter?

11:46.806 --> 11:48.740
Did you turn out the light? Certainly not.

11:48.808 --> 11:50.776
They're out.
So what?

11:50.843 --> 11:52.936
Maybe the lightning
struck the power line.

11:53.012 --> 11:56.277
I get in more messes around
here. Take off that canvas.

11:56.348 --> 11:58.782
Take it off?
Take it off!

12:02.154 --> 12:05.123
Hey, a coffin!
C-Coffin.

12:06.459 --> 12:09.622
Dracula crest.
Dracula's crest.

12:09.695 --> 12:14.132
I wonder if Mr. McDougal expects people
to think that Dracula's really in there.

12:14.200 --> 12:16.361
No, don't.
Please don't.

12:16.435 --> 12:21.498
Oh, now come, come. Dracula
was just a legendary character.

12:21.574 --> 12:24.099
He never existed. Certainly not. No?

12:24.176 --> 12:27.373
Fold up this canvas. I'm going
out and get the other crate.

12:27.446 --> 12:29.937
If you want me, just holler
"Oh, Chick!" You understand?

12:30.015 --> 12:31.607
Oh, Chick!
What?

12:31.684 --> 12:33.675
What kept you?
I haven't left yet.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.950
The next time, don't take so
long. Fold this up. Get busy.

12:49.835 --> 12:53.703
"Count Dracula sleeps
in this coffin...

12:53.773 --> 12:56.298
but rises every night
at sunset. "

12:56.375 --> 12:59.276
Chick is right.
This is silly stuff.

12:59.345 --> 13:01.973
"Dracula... "

13:11.056 --> 13:14.924
Chick! Chi... ick!

13:14.994 --> 13:17.827
What's the matter? You know that
person you said there's no such person?

13:17.897 --> 13:22.664
I think he's in there... in person. I was
reading this sign, "Dracula's Legend. "

13:22.735 --> 13:26.296
All of a sudden I heard...

13:26.372 --> 13:28.533
That's the wind.
It should get oiled.

13:28.607 --> 13:32.703
Stop reading this. That's a lot of
baloney to fool McDougal's customers.

13:32.778 --> 13:36.270
Fold up that canvas.
Get busy. Come on.

13:45.991 --> 13:49.654
"Dracula can change himself
at will into a vampire bat,

13:49.728 --> 13:54.165
flying about
the countryside. "

13:54.233 --> 13:56.565
Flying.

13:56.635 --> 14:00.696
Ooh-ooh-ooh!

14:03.275 --> 14:05.209
Chick!

14:05.277 --> 14:08.110
Chick.!

14:08.180 --> 14:10.546
You're making enough noise
to wake up the dead!

14:10.616 --> 14:12.880
I don't have to wake him up.
He's up. I saw a hand.

14:12.952 --> 14:15.352
You saw a hand? Where? Right over there.

14:15.421 --> 14:18.049
Let me see it.
Where is it?

14:18.123 --> 14:20.523
I saw a hand there! You don't
know what you're talking about!

14:20.593 --> 14:23.790
You're excited reading
this legend. Listen, Wilbur.

14:23.863 --> 14:28.027
I know there's no such person as Dracula.
You know there's no such person as Dracula!

14:28.100 --> 14:30.694
But does Dracula know it? Listen to me.

14:30.769 --> 14:34.705
McDougal will be here any minute with
the insurance agent. Now get to work!

14:51.357 --> 14:55.794
"He keeps himself alive
by drinking the blood... "

15:09.041 --> 15:12.772
Chick. Chick.

15:12.845 --> 15:14.836
Chick.

15:14.914 --> 15:18.372
Chick. Ch...

15:22.488 --> 15:25.218
Ch-Ch-Chick!

15:25.291 --> 15:27.657
Oh!

15:27.726 --> 15:30.160
Listen, this is getting
to be ridiculous.

15:30.229 --> 15:32.459
What?

15:32.531 --> 15:35.193
Are you trying to tell me
that candle moved?

15:35.267 --> 15:38.327
Candles can't move!
This one did.

15:38.404 --> 15:40.929
Watch it.
Keep your eye on it.

15:41.006 --> 15:43.440
Is it moving?
Huh?

15:43.509 --> 15:45.477
It's not moving, is it?
Not now.

15:45.544 --> 15:49.275
Use your brains a bit.
Let's get this job finished.

15:56.555 --> 15:59.080
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

16:04.063 --> 16:08.295
"He keeps himself alive by
drinking the blood of his victims. "

16:08.367 --> 16:13.930
Hmph. "Count Dracula must return
to his coffin before sunrise.

16:14.006 --> 16:17.908
He, he, he...
H-H-He... "

16:19.979 --> 16:22.345
Chick! Chick!

16:22.414 --> 16:26.510
Oh, Chick!
Ha-ha-ha, Chick!

16:26.585 --> 16:31.079
Chick! Oh, oh, oh!

16:31.156 --> 16:35.024
Oh, Chick, come on!
Come on!

16:35.094 --> 16:37.392
All right,
I'm comin'.

16:37.463 --> 16:40.864
Come on, will ya! Wait a
minute. What's wrong now?

16:40.933 --> 16:43.561
Oh, Chick!

16:43.635 --> 16:45.967
You gonna tell me that candle
moved again? Yeah, yeah.

16:46.038 --> 16:48.768
I told you not to read this,
didn't I? I can't help it.

16:48.841 --> 16:52.004
"Count Dracula must return
to his coffin before sunrise,

16:52.077 --> 16:54.637
where he lies helpless
during the day. "

16:54.713 --> 16:59.377
That's the bunk! That's what I'm
trying to tell ya. That's his bunk!

16:59.451 --> 17:01.681
Come here.

17:01.754 --> 17:05.121
Don't, Chick. Come here.
Come here! Come around here!

17:06.090 --> 17:09.253
Come over here.
Look in there.

17:09.328 --> 17:12.491
Now,
do you see anything?

17:12.564 --> 17:14.498
No.
Certainly not.

17:14.566 --> 17:18.434
Help me open that crate. Come on. Hmph.

17:18.503 --> 17:20.869
Get with it,
will you please?

17:22.141 --> 17:24.075
You can always...

17:24.143 --> 17:28.580
"Frankenstein's Monster. "
Get a load of this.

17:28.647 --> 17:31.241
"A scientist named Frankenstein
made a monster...

17:31.316 --> 17:33.784
by sewing together parts
of old, dead bodies. "

17:33.852 --> 17:35.786
Do you have to read that stuff? Wait.

17:35.854 --> 17:40.291
"Frankenstein gave the monster eternal
life by shooting it full of electricity.

17:40.359 --> 17:43.726
Some people claim it is not
dead even now, just dormant. "

17:43.796 --> 17:47.562
Now who'd be silly enough
to believe that?

17:52.571 --> 17:55.369
Who would be silly enough
to believe that?

17:58.610 --> 18:00.601
Me.

18:03.415 --> 18:05.440
Open up that crate.

18:19.431 --> 18:21.399
Chick,
did you hear that?

18:21.467 --> 18:24.061
Yeah, I heard you pulling
the nails out. Go ahead.

18:24.136 --> 18:26.627
Pulling the nails?

18:36.248 --> 18:38.307
Chick?
Quiet.

18:38.383 --> 18:40.783
I don't want to hear any more
of your foolish questions.

18:40.853 --> 18:43.321
Come on,
open up the crate.

18:47.593 --> 18:49.618
There we are.

18:49.695 --> 18:52.823
You've got it.
Now get ahold of it.

18:52.898 --> 18:55.366
Throw it
right on the side.

18:55.434 --> 18:59.336
That's it, fine. Come on,
help me with this excelsior.

18:59.404 --> 19:01.872
Take it all out.

19:01.940 --> 19:05.103
Wow! Look out!
Cover it up!

19:05.177 --> 19:08.237
What's the matter? Cover
the whole... Ooh, ooh!

19:08.313 --> 19:11.805
Aw, stop that!

19:11.884 --> 19:13.818
Uh-oh.
Now you did it.

19:13.886 --> 19:16.047
What are you doing in there
with the lights off?

19:16.121 --> 19:18.055
McDougal!
Now we're in trouble.

19:18.123 --> 19:20.455
Hide that head.
Hurry up!

21:08.667 --> 21:10.601
Master.

21:10.669 --> 21:12.569
Yes.

21:45.570 --> 21:49.700
Come. Follow me.

22:01.820 --> 22:06.348
Don't be afraid.
He won't hurt you.

22:06.425 --> 22:08.359
Come!

22:10.696 --> 22:13.062
Hurry up.
Come.

22:14.099 --> 22:16.158
This better be
a good one.

22:16.234 --> 22:20.136
What's the matter, you
afraid of the dark? No.

22:20.205 --> 22:22.639
Yeah, that's it.
That's it.

22:25.410 --> 22:27.537
What is this?

22:27.612 --> 22:31.844
McDougal is here. I... What's the
matter with you? Snap out of it.

22:31.917 --> 22:34.317
Where are my bodies?
There were no bodies.

22:34.386 --> 22:36.411
We opened both crates.
Look in there.

22:36.488 --> 22:38.615
If they're not here, where
are they? They must be stolen.

22:38.690 --> 22:40.920
My company inspected the
contents before they were shipped.

22:40.992 --> 22:43.222
Then they must've been
stolen en route. You saw them?

22:43.295 --> 22:45.525
No, no. Then where did they go?

22:45.597 --> 22:47.963
I don't know. If they're gone,
I want my insurance money.

22:48.033 --> 22:50.831
My company doesn't pay off
until a full investigation.

22:50.902 --> 22:53.700
If you don't produce those bodies,
I'm going to call the police!

22:53.772 --> 22:56.297
Police?
P-Police!

22:56.375 --> 22:59.105
I can do better than that.
Police!

22:59.177 --> 23:03.273
I'll get you.
Come on, go on!

23:09.788 --> 23:12.450
Let's take it out.

23:16.695 --> 23:18.629
Come!

24:26.231 --> 24:28.256
Good evening,
Dr. Mornay.

24:28.333 --> 24:31.131
My dear Count,
it's so good to see you again.

24:31.203 --> 24:34.400
And you look more charming
than when I saw you last.

24:34.473 --> 24:38.739
Come in, Count Dracula. Thank you, Sandra.

24:38.810 --> 24:43.076
But the name is Dr. Lejos. I wouldn't
want to frighten your technical assistant.

24:43.148 --> 24:45.673
Professor Stevens?
Don't worry.

24:45.750 --> 24:48.184
He's completely engrossed
in his work.

24:48.253 --> 24:51.381
Besides, he should be out of
here by tomorrow. Excellent.

24:51.456 --> 24:54.118
Yes, except that he's asking
too many questions.

24:54.192 --> 24:57.491
I will take care of that.
Is everything else arranged?

24:57.562 --> 25:00.122
Yes. Where did you leave him? In the cold.

25:00.198 --> 25:02.632
I'll get a wrap.

25:14.813 --> 25:17.247
Nervous, my dear?

25:17.315 --> 25:19.681
This is risky business.

25:19.751 --> 25:22.948
Not as risky as those
curious operations of yours...

25:23.021 --> 25:26.252
that so intrigued
the European police.

25:26.324 --> 25:29.088
Yet much more
profitable.

25:29.160 --> 25:33.688
Restore the monster for me, and
you shall have anything you wish.

25:33.765 --> 25:36.825
In that case, we better start
as soon as possible.

25:36.902 --> 25:40.360
It's dangerous to leave him
in this weakened condition.

25:40.438 --> 25:43.839
Have you mastered
Dr. Frankenstein's notebook?

25:43.909 --> 25:47.902
Let me get my hand on a
scalpel again and you shall see.

25:47.979 --> 25:50.004
And about the brain!

25:50.081 --> 25:52.549
I don't want to repeat
Frankenstein's mistake...

25:52.617 --> 25:55.609
and revive a vicious,
unmanageable brute.

25:55.687 --> 25:59.384
This time the monster must
have no will of his own.

25:59.457 --> 26:02.949
No fiendish intellect
to oppose his master.

26:03.028 --> 26:06.794
There, dear Count, I believe I
have exceeded your fondest wishes.

26:06.865 --> 26:10.323
The new brain I've chosen
for the monster is so simple,

26:10.402 --> 26:13.963
so pliable, it will obey
you like a trained dog.

26:14.039 --> 26:17.907
Good.
How soon?

26:17.976 --> 26:22.003
The day after tomorrow. Wilbur
was taking me to a masquerade ball.

26:22.080 --> 26:26.141
But I'm sure he'd prefer to
spend a quiet evening at home.

26:27.652 --> 26:30.086
Bring him
through here.

26:38.697 --> 26:42.189
I tell you, Chick, I saw
what I saw when I saw it!

26:42.267 --> 26:45.668
Keep quiet! You babbling
about dead people walking away!

26:45.737 --> 26:48.501
That's why we were arrested
and thrown in jail.

26:48.573 --> 26:52.065
Do you realize we've spent a
whole day and night in jail?

26:52.143 --> 26:55.579
And we'd still be there if
some dame hadn't bailed us out.

26:55.647 --> 27:00.175
Chick, stop calling Sandra
a dame!

27:00.251 --> 27:02.549
I'm tellin' ya,
they were there.

27:02.621 --> 27:05.419
Oh, stop.
Two of'em.

27:05.490 --> 27:07.890
One of'em
was about eight foot tall.

27:07.959 --> 27:11.395
Way up there!
And he walked like this.

27:16.835 --> 27:18.769
Just like that.

27:20.405 --> 27:22.566
Now, that's the way he walked. Stop it.

27:22.641 --> 27:24.575
You don't believe that? Certainly not!

27:24.643 --> 27:28.010
Well, I saw it.
And the other one,

27:28.079 --> 27:30.070
he went like this.

27:33.318 --> 27:36.515
And he kept gettin'
closer and closer.

27:36.588 --> 27:39.614
He had eyes
that were balls of fire.

27:39.691 --> 27:43.889
He kept staring,
eye to eye.

27:43.962 --> 27:48.194
Eye to eye!
Staring!

27:48.266 --> 27:50.257
I never saw anything like it
in my life.

27:50.335 --> 27:53.270
Believe me when I tell you
I was scared to death.

27:53.338 --> 27:57.001
Really I was.
I was really scared, Chick.

27:58.276 --> 28:00.369
What's the matter...
Chick?

28:03.148 --> 28:05.116
Oh!
What did I do?

28:05.183 --> 28:10.052
Hey, Chick, I don't like you like that.
Come on, be just like you used to be.

28:10.121 --> 28:12.954
Ah, go away! Atta boy! I'm happy.

28:13.024 --> 28:16.323
That's just like you used
to be. Stop this nonsense!

28:25.103 --> 28:27.037
You're Wilbur Gray?
Yes, sir.

28:27.105 --> 28:29.039
Then you must be Chick Young. So what?

28:29.107 --> 28:31.371
I'm Lawrence Talbot. I've been
looking all over town for you.

28:31.443 --> 28:34.742
You didn't have to look far.
We were in jail. Yes, I know.

28:34.813 --> 28:37.839
I'm the one who telephoned you
not to deliver those bodies.

28:37.916 --> 28:40.908
I knew they were alive! Oh! Oh!

28:40.985 --> 28:44.443
So you thought I was imagining things when
I told you about the fellow eight feet tall...

28:44.522 --> 28:48.049
walking with the stiff legs, and
the other fellow with this here.

28:48.126 --> 28:50.993
Wait! You're crazy,
and so is this screwball!

28:51.062 --> 28:54.463
Look, I have my own troubles.
Worse than you think.

28:54.532 --> 28:56.796
I followed Dracula
all the way from Europe...

28:56.868 --> 29:01.100
because I believe he's going to try
and revive the Frankenstein monster.

29:01.172 --> 29:04.403
We must find him and destroy him
before he can do this! Wait a minute.

29:04.476 --> 29:08.105
Go down to the police, tell them you know
the story about Dracula and the monster.

29:08.179 --> 29:11.478
They'd be very interested. I can't do that.

29:11.549 --> 29:14.985
Because then I'd have
to tell them who I am...

29:15.053 --> 29:18.181
and why I know
what I know.

29:18.256 --> 29:22.852
Soon...
Soon the moon will rise.

29:28.767 --> 29:31.031
I haven't time
to explain.

29:31.102 --> 29:34.731
I've taken the room across the
hall. Here's the key. Lock me in!

29:34.806 --> 29:37.274
Lock you in? Yes, please. Hurry!

29:37.342 --> 29:39.833
It's silly,
but I'll do it.

29:39.911 --> 29:41.845
He's scared too.

29:44.649 --> 29:47.641
Remember, no matter what
you hear or what happens,

29:47.719 --> 29:50.313
don't let me out!

30:07.839 --> 30:11.240
"Lock me in. " That guy
is screwier than you are.

30:11.309 --> 30:13.368
He is not.
He's a nice man.

30:13.444 --> 30:16.311
He's worried about the police getting
him because he knows they're alive.

30:16.381 --> 30:20.147
I'm going to bed.
Well...

30:20.218 --> 30:22.379
Hey,
he forgot his bag.

30:26.157 --> 30:29.183
Mr. Talbot,
you forgot your grip.

30:29.260 --> 30:31.194
Mr. Talbot?

30:34.866 --> 30:39.327
Mr. Talbot?

30:58.389 --> 31:01.187
Now, how'd he
get out of here?

31:01.259 --> 31:03.420
Hmph.
I'll leave him a note.

31:09.067 --> 31:12.833
I left your bag...

31:12.904 --> 31:15.668
in the bedroom.

31:17.141 --> 31:19.371
Wilbur.

31:48.873 --> 31:51.706
I wonder if
he counted these.

31:51.776 --> 31:53.710
He might've.

32:01.152 --> 32:03.086
Aah!

32:12.263 --> 32:14.823
Maybe he didn't.

32:21.706 --> 32:24.106
A fine insurance company
I'm doing business with!

32:24.175 --> 32:26.109
Outsmarted by
a couple of morons!

32:26.177 --> 32:28.407
Those two crooks
got out of jail on bail!

32:28.479 --> 32:30.606
We know, Mr. McDougal,
but you see we...

32:30.682 --> 32:34.049
In fact, I arranged it. Who are you?

32:34.118 --> 32:37.417
This is Miss Raymond, an
investigator from the home office.

32:37.488 --> 32:41.424
It's my job to find
those missing exhibits.

32:41.492 --> 32:46.794
I'm sure I can persuade the chubby
fellow to lead me right to them.

32:46.864 --> 32:50.163
Naturally I couldn't persuade
him very well in jail.

32:52.170 --> 32:55.105
Wilbur, please! I've had
nightmares all night long!

32:55.173 --> 32:58.472
I don't want to hear any more about dead
bodies. I saw what I saw when I saw it.

32:58.543 --> 33:01.410
All right.

33:01.479 --> 33:04.175
Am I glad to see you.
Will you talk to that guy?

33:04.248 --> 33:07.547
Sandra! Darling, I heard what happened.

33:07.618 --> 33:10.451
That's awful. They can't put
my little Wilbur in jail.

33:10.521 --> 33:14.423
They can't, but they did.
Thank you for bailing us out.

33:14.492 --> 33:16.517
I? I only learned
about it this morning.

33:16.594 --> 33:21.258
Didn't the policeman tell you
a lady bailed us out? He did.

33:21.332 --> 33:24.699
Wilbur, you haven't been
untrue to your Sandra?

33:24.769 --> 33:28.330
Sandra, how can you look
me in the face and say that?

33:28.406 --> 33:31.898
How can you look him in
the face period? Hmph.

33:31.976 --> 33:35.707
I came by to remind you about
the masquerade ball tonight.

33:35.780 --> 33:38.180
I was getting ready
to pick up my costume.

33:38.249 --> 33:42.185
Come by for me early,
dearest. About sunset.

33:43.688 --> 33:46.316
Alone.
Good-bye.

33:47.892 --> 33:50.827
What I'd like to know is, what
has he got that I haven't got?

33:50.895 --> 33:53.489
A brain.

33:53.564 --> 33:56.590
Ahh.
A brain.

33:56.667 --> 33:59.192
I'd like to know
where it is.

33:59.270 --> 34:01.864
Oh. She forgot
to kiss me good-bye.

34:06.310 --> 34:08.972
Mmm! Oh, oh.

34:09.047 --> 34:12.574
Now who is this? She's...
She's... She's beautiful.

34:12.650 --> 34:15.483
I'm Joan Raymond.
She's Joan Raymond.

34:15.553 --> 34:18.181
I'm the girl who arranged
your release from jail.

34:18.255 --> 34:20.746
Why should you want
to spring us?

34:20.824 --> 34:23.487
Do you believe in love
at first sight?

34:23.561 --> 34:27.018
Well! As long as you
put it that way, I, uh...

34:27.098 --> 34:29.692
That's what happened
to me.

34:29.766 --> 34:32.634
Wilbur, darling!

34:35.572 --> 34:39.976
Miss Raymond, when did this
mad feeling first come over you?

34:40.043 --> 34:44.481
The instant I saw you in the baggage
room. I knew then that I wanted to spend...

34:44.549 --> 34:46.516
every minute that
I'm in town with you.

34:46.583 --> 34:48.279
You did?

34:48.351 --> 34:51.650
What are we doing tonight?
He's going to a masquerade ball.

34:51.722 --> 34:54.054
But, uh,
I'm not doing anything.

34:54.125 --> 34:56.889
- In that case, you'll be lonesome.
- Well, naturally...

34:56.960 --> 35:02.627
Darling, I haven't been to a masquerade
ball in ages. I was hoping you'd ask me.

35:02.700 --> 35:04.793
Wilbur!

35:04.869 --> 35:06.894
Come here.

35:06.971 --> 35:10.998
Miss Raymond,
will you excuse me?

35:11.075 --> 35:14.067
Oh,
you irresistible boy!

35:15.546 --> 35:19.539
Do you want me? Yes, I
want you. Come over here.

35:19.617 --> 35:23.485
I just wanted to get a good
look at you in the light.

35:23.554 --> 35:25.488
I still don't get it.
Jealous?

35:25.556 --> 35:28.582
Wilbur, I'll have to go out
and get a costume.

35:28.659 --> 35:30.627
That's funny.
I was just going too.

35:30.695 --> 35:34.529
I'll go to my room, pick up a couple
things and meet you in the lobby.

35:34.599 --> 35:36.931
All right.
In the lobby.

35:37.001 --> 35:40.129
I'll get my hat and coat. I'll
be right with you. Excuse me.

35:40.204 --> 35:43.765
Now you've got two dates. What
about Sandra, you bigamist?

35:43.841 --> 35:47.470
Sandra? I don't know.
Joan is awful cute.

35:47.545 --> 35:50.639
All right, you takeJoan, I'll
take Sandra. Oh, Sandra sends me.

35:50.715 --> 35:53.411
Then I'll takeJoan.
Joan sends me too.

35:53.484 --> 35:56.385
Listen, you sawed-off Romeo,
in a minute, I'll send you!

35:56.454 --> 35:59.446
You don't even appeal
to me.

35:59.524 --> 36:03.153
Look, Wilbur, we've always
been pals, haven't we? Yes.

36:03.227 --> 36:05.821
We've always shared and shared
alike, haven't we? Mm-hmm.

36:05.897 --> 36:08.457
Let's be reasonable.
Come on.

36:08.533 --> 36:10.592
I've always shared with you. That you have!

36:10.668 --> 36:13.193
If I had two cigarettes, I'd
give you one. That's right.

36:13.271 --> 36:16.104
If I had two pair of shoes, I'd
give you a pair. Don't I know that?

36:16.174 --> 36:18.870
And if I have two girls... Well?

36:18.943 --> 36:22.208
Why don't you light that cigarette, put on
those shoes and take a walk for yourself?

36:22.280 --> 36:25.340
That's what I'm going to do,
but with you.

36:37.395 --> 36:40.193
This key don't fit.
This is Tal...

36:40.264 --> 36:43.256
Talbot's key.
Hey, we forgot about him.

36:48.906 --> 36:52.706
Boy, what a bender
he must've been on last night!

36:53.811 --> 36:56.541
Hey, Mr. Talbot.
Mr. Talbot!

36:56.614 --> 36:58.639
And I thought you were such
a nice man. Look at yourself.

36:58.716 --> 37:02.618
You're a mess.!
Last night...

37:02.687 --> 37:05.918
I went through another
of my horrible experiences.

37:05.990 --> 37:09.687
Years ago I was bitten
by a werewolf.

37:09.760 --> 37:12.422
Ever since,
when the full moon rises...

37:12.496 --> 37:15.124
I turn into a wolf
myself.

37:15.199 --> 37:19.966
Oh, pal,
that's all right.

37:20.037 --> 37:24.497
I'm sort of a wolf myself.
And here I thought...

37:24.575 --> 37:27.339
I thought that you were the
only one that would believe me,

37:27.411 --> 37:31.370
that you were the one that
knew I spoke the truth.

37:31.449 --> 37:34.543
You have seen...
the living dead.

37:34.619 --> 37:37.144
Mm-hmm.

37:37.221 --> 37:39.451
I came all the way
from Europe...

37:39.523 --> 37:42.856
because Dracula and the
monster must be destroyed.

37:42.927 --> 37:44.827
Together
we must find them!

37:44.895 --> 37:47.227
Let's not start that
all over again.

37:47.298 --> 37:49.960
I can't go. I've got a date.
In fact, I've got two dates.

37:50.034 --> 37:54.403
But you and I... have a date with destiny.

37:54.472 --> 37:56.838
Let Chick go
with destiny.

37:56.907 --> 37:59.273
Won't you please?
Huh?

38:07.718 --> 38:11.279
You kids stay here.
I'm going up and get Sandra.

38:13.557 --> 38:15.525
She's mine too.

38:17.862 --> 38:20.387
Pardon me just a minute.
Wilbur!

38:20.464 --> 38:24.457
Look, you've got Joan and
Sandra. You've got two girls!

38:24.535 --> 38:27.026
How about the two girls we had last
week? Let's not talk about that.

38:27.104 --> 38:29.698
You got no kick comin'. You had
the best lookin' one. So what?

38:29.774 --> 38:32.436
Yours had teeth.
Yours had teeth too.

38:32.510 --> 38:34.341
Did you see that tooth?
I happened to see it.

38:34.412 --> 38:36.744
Mine had so much bridgework, every
time I kissed her I had to pay toll.

38:36.814 --> 38:38.748
What's the use?

38:38.816 --> 38:41.683
Wilbur, can't we both
go along too?

38:41.752 --> 38:44.915
Yes, mon amour. That's
Spanish. That's French.

38:44.989 --> 38:49.119
How do you like that? I speak
French too. You cute devil!

38:49.193 --> 38:51.127
Stop that.

38:51.195 --> 38:54.130
Come on, lead the way. Come on.

39:12.750 --> 39:14.684
Hello.
Hello.

39:14.752 --> 39:16.379
Is Sandra in?
Who?

39:16.454 --> 39:19.514
Sandra.
You mean Dr. Mornay?

39:19.590 --> 39:22.081
If that's what she is, I'm
just what the doctor ordered.

39:22.159 --> 39:24.093
Come in.
Thank you.

39:25.563 --> 39:28.123
I thought Sandra
was your date.

39:28.199 --> 39:30.793
Or did we both come along
for the ride? No, no.

39:30.868 --> 39:33.769
Perhaps I should introduce
myself. I'm Professor Stevens.

39:33.838 --> 39:37.205
This is Miss Raymond, Wilbur
Gray, and I'm Chick Young.

39:37.274 --> 39:39.799
How do you do, Miss Raymond? How do you do?

39:39.877 --> 39:42.675
I have work to finish, but it
shouldn't take more than a few minutes.

39:42.747 --> 39:47.013
Wait in the library. I'll be right
down. We're here to pick up Sandra.

39:47.084 --> 39:50.417
Of course. I'm sure
she's around somewhere.

39:50.488 --> 39:52.615
Wilbur!

39:52.690 --> 39:55.352
Sandra, hello.

39:55.426 --> 39:58.361
That girl, who is she? Um, mmm...

39:58.429 --> 40:01.956
Uh, she's Chick's date. She's
going to the masquerade with us.

40:02.032 --> 40:05.433
I told you to come here alone.
We'll have to get rid of them.

40:05.503 --> 40:08.131
I'll have to get rid
of somebody.

40:09.006 --> 40:11.065
Hello, Sandra.
Hello, Chick.

40:11.142 --> 40:14.043
Joan, this is Sandra.
Sandra, Joan.

40:14.111 --> 40:17.478
Nice place you have here, Doctor.
Who told you I was a doctor?

40:17.548 --> 40:20.210
Why, the young man
who answered the door.

40:20.284 --> 40:22.548
Oh, Professor Stevens.

40:22.620 --> 40:26.215
I'm on a vacation, you see,
and traveling incognito.

40:26.290 --> 40:29.225
What are you doing here? Same thing.

40:29.293 --> 40:33.855
Shall we get going? As
soon as I put on my costume.

40:33.931 --> 40:36.923
Would you like to powder
your nose? I'd love to.

40:37.001 --> 40:40.300
I'll be right back,
Wilbur.

40:40.371 --> 40:44.501
I'll be right back, too,
Wilbur.

40:44.575 --> 40:46.509
Toodle-oo!

40:47.812 --> 40:49.780
Oh.

40:51.449 --> 40:56.011
Chick, there's a time in everyone's
life... when they get in trouble.

40:56.086 --> 40:58.213
I'm in a mess of it now. What's wrong?

40:58.289 --> 41:01.053
I've got two girls.
You know the old saying?

41:01.125 --> 41:05.061
"Everything comes in threes. " Suppose a
third girl should fall in love with you?

41:05.129 --> 41:08.326
What's her name? We'll
say her name is Mary.

41:08.399 --> 41:10.333
Is she pretty?
Beautiful.

41:10.401 --> 41:14.667
She'd have to be. Now you
have Mary, Joan and Sandra.

41:14.738 --> 41:17.468
To prove to you that I'm
your pal, your bosom friend,

41:17.541 --> 41:19.668
I'll take one of the girls
off your hands.

41:19.743 --> 41:23.372
Chick, you're what I call
a real pal. It's all right.

41:23.447 --> 41:26.905
You take Mary.

41:26.984 --> 41:30.977
We better answer that phone.
They're all upstairs. Hello.

41:31.055 --> 41:33.990
Hello?
Is Dr. Lejos there?

41:34.058 --> 41:37.186
Just a minute. Somebody wants to know
about a Dr. Lejos. I don't know him.

41:37.261 --> 41:39.627
Hello? Who is this speaking?
This is Wilbur Gray.

41:39.697 --> 41:42.757
I thought I recognized
your voice.

41:42.833 --> 41:45.393
This is Talbot speaking.

41:45.469 --> 41:49.303
Listen. I just got a line
on Dracula and the monster.

41:49.373 --> 41:54.470
Dr. Lejos has been receiving
a lot of electrical equipment,

41:54.545 --> 41:57.514
just the type necessary
to revive the monster.

41:57.581 --> 42:00.414
So what?
I'm way out on an island.

42:00.484 --> 42:02.850
I've got my own problems.
But listen.

42:02.920 --> 42:07.118
I believe you're in
the house of Dracula right now.

42:07.191 --> 42:11.491
You can find the monster,
and I'll...

42:11.562 --> 42:14.030
Hello?
Wilbur!

42:14.098 --> 42:17.761
Come here! Chick, you don't
know what you're doin'!

42:17.835 --> 42:20.269
What's the matter with
you? Shh, quiet. Come here.

42:20.337 --> 42:22.271
- You didn't hang up the phone.
- Let him hang up the phone.

42:22.339 --> 42:24.705
Who? Dracula and the monster live here.

42:24.775 --> 42:27.710
Don't start that again.
Who told you that?

42:27.778 --> 42:30.941
Talbot. He also said we've got
to search the place. Come here.

42:31.015 --> 42:33.449
Come over here.

42:33.517 --> 42:36.509
Listen, Talbot, enough is
enough. Wilbur's scared...

42:36.587 --> 42:39.078
Hello? Hello? He's gone. So am I.

42:39.156 --> 42:42.683
No, you don't. I'm gonna settle this thing
once and for all. We'll search this place.

42:42.760 --> 42:46.526
It's past sunset; and if Dracula
is here, he's gonna want breakfast.

42:46.597 --> 42:50.192
And I'm fatter than you, and it
ain't gonna be me! Just a minute.

42:50.267 --> 42:54.761
It ain't gonna be me! I'm gonna prove
how crazy both you and Talbot are.

42:54.838 --> 42:57.033
We'll search this place,
right from the basement.

42:57.107 --> 43:00.440
Chick, we'll search it, you and
I together. Now we're talkin'.

43:00.511 --> 43:03.446
Atta boy. You search the basement,
I'll search outside. No, you don't!

43:03.514 --> 43:06.108
All right, I'll search outside. and you
search the basement. That's different.

43:06.183 --> 43:09.380
Mm-hmm-hmm. It
worked! Ha-ha! Come on!

43:10.554 --> 43:13.455
Let's look around here.

43:13.524 --> 43:16.186
There's some doors
down there.

43:16.260 --> 43:19.058
You think we oughta tell Sandra
where we're goin'? Certainly not.

43:20.497 --> 43:23.091
You look over there.

43:36.246 --> 43:39.079
Well?
Broom closet.

43:39.149 --> 43:42.380
Broom closet? Look out. Mm-hmm.

43:42.453 --> 43:44.478
Come on.

43:45.889 --> 43:48.153
Broom closet?

43:49.159 --> 43:52.925
Come on!
Wait for me.

46:08.098 --> 46:10.123
Whoa!

46:12.636 --> 46:14.661
Chick! Open!

46:28.418 --> 46:30.682
Whoa!

46:32.589 --> 46:36.116
Ooh! Chick!
Ahh! Chick!

46:36.193 --> 46:40.994
Ah, Chick!

46:46.537 --> 46:49.802
Aw, stop! It's the truth. Come here.

46:52.376 --> 46:54.435
All I did
was like this.

46:56.847 --> 46:59.748
I tell you, right over
there. Where are they?

46:59.817 --> 47:01.717
They're in there.
Listen.

47:01.785 --> 47:04.481
Wait. I'm gonna
look around.

47:04.555 --> 47:08.013
You go ahead. If I don't find
anybody, I'm gonna beat your ears off.

47:08.091 --> 47:10.218
Honest.
They're over there.

47:10.294 --> 47:13.388
Oh, no. I ain't goin'
near that place anymore.

47:19.870 --> 47:21.861
Whoa! Ooh!

47:23.373 --> 47:27.002
Open sesame!
Open sesame!

47:45.329 --> 47:48.127
Well, where are they?
They must be in there.

47:48.198 --> 47:52.464
Stop. I'm getting sick and tired
of this silly nonsense of yours.

47:52.536 --> 47:55.937
Some guy going around...
Uh-uh, uh-uh.

47:56.006 --> 47:58.998
Another guy goin'... Uh! No, no!

47:59.076 --> 48:01.044
The one guy goes...

48:01.111 --> 48:04.569
And the other guy,
not like that, like this.

48:04.648 --> 48:07.515
All right.
Put your hands down.

48:07.584 --> 48:10.917
Come on, the girls
are waiting for us upstairs.

48:11.421 --> 48:14.720
Have you known Wilbur long?
Yes, we're old friends.

48:14.791 --> 48:18.727
Will you be long?
Just a few minutes.

49:12.749 --> 49:15.377
Miss Raymond?
Yes?

49:15.452 --> 49:18.080
I'm ready.
Shall we go?

49:18.155 --> 49:20.316
Of course.

49:20.390 --> 49:22.984
Here's your purse, dear.
Thank you.

49:36.573 --> 49:39.133
Who screamed?

49:39.209 --> 49:42.667
You did! I did? Ha-ha.

49:42.746 --> 49:46.978
Listen, Wilbur, if you don't
stop imagining these crazy things,

49:47.050 --> 49:49.041
I'll take you to a doctor
to have you examined.

49:49.119 --> 49:52.486
But I saw them. And when
I see what I see, I saw it.

49:52.556 --> 49:56.788
Mr. Talbot, he saw it too. Talbot!
He's crazy. You're both crazy!

49:56.860 --> 49:58.760
Sandra.

49:58.829 --> 50:01.855
Sandra, I've gotta tell you. I
was downstairs in the basement.

50:01.932 --> 50:05.493
Basement? What were you doing
down there? I opened the door.

50:05.569 --> 50:08.333
He opened the door and fell
down the stairs. Fibber.

50:08.405 --> 50:12.432
How careless.!
You should be careful.!

50:12.509 --> 50:16.946
A person can get killed! I
hope you weren't disturbed.

50:17.014 --> 50:19.380
It's perfectly all right.
Introduce me.

50:19.449 --> 50:21.781
This is Miss Raymond.
Mr. Young.

50:21.852 --> 50:23.877
And this is Wilbur.

50:23.954 --> 50:26.821
Ahh, Wilbur!

50:26.890 --> 50:28.790
Why!

50:28.859 --> 50:33.626
I've heard so much about you, I
feel as if we have already met.

50:33.697 --> 50:39.158
I must say, my dear, I approve
very highly of your choice.

50:39.236 --> 50:42.967
What we need today
is young blood.

50:43.040 --> 50:45.008
And brains!

50:48.378 --> 50:52.280
Oh, don't be bashful.
Come.

50:52.349 --> 50:56.786
Hello, Dr. Lejos. I've been
looking for you all day.

50:56.853 --> 50:59.822
Every time I ask Dr. Mornay what that
equipment is going to be used for,

50:59.890 --> 51:03.155
she says to ask you.
Of course.

51:03.226 --> 51:05.854
Didn't I hear that you
were going to masquerade ball?

51:05.929 --> 51:09.524
Yes, we have our costumes in
the boat. Oh, you young people!

51:09.599 --> 51:14.002
Making the most of life...
while it lasts.

51:14.071 --> 51:15.834
Thank you.

51:15.906 --> 51:19.933
Professor,
you worked hard and well.

51:20.010 --> 51:23.571
Why don't you join them, and save
your questions until tomorrow?

51:23.647 --> 51:28.641
Under ordinary circumstances I'd
say no, but... if you don't mind?

51:28.718 --> 51:31.380
Not at all. Good. I'll get my coat.

51:34.357 --> 51:36.882
Of course that would make
too many for one boat.

51:36.960 --> 51:40.225
But if the professor and this
lady and gentleman go on ahead,

51:40.297 --> 51:43.323
Wilbur and Dr. Mornay
can... I'm afraid I can't.

51:43.400 --> 51:46.927
What's the matter? I've suddenly
developed a splitting headache.

51:47.003 --> 51:50.029
I'm sorry, Wilbur, but
you'll have to go without me.

51:50.107 --> 51:52.598
Nonsense! It will pass
as quickly as it came.

51:52.676 --> 51:56.339
It's no use, Doctor. I shall
have to go directly to bed.

51:58.682 --> 52:02.277
Pardon me. Well, Chick,
there goes your date.

52:04.721 --> 52:06.814
What was that all about?

52:06.890 --> 52:10.690
This is too dangerous. The girl
is an insurance investigator.

52:10.760 --> 52:12.990
Stevens is asking
too many questions.

52:13.063 --> 52:16.624
Wilbur was up to something in
the basement. We ought to wait.

52:16.700 --> 52:21.069
And jeopardize the success
of the operation? Never!

52:21.138 --> 52:26.235
I must warn you, my dear Sandra, I am
accustomed to having my orders obeyed,

52:26.309 --> 52:30.268
especially by women
with a price on their heads.

52:30.347 --> 52:33.339
Don't try to scare me,
Count Dracula.

52:41.057 --> 52:44.993
Here. The Secrets of Life
and Death by Dr. Frankenstein.

52:46.930 --> 52:51.890
Memorize them. Operate yourself,
if you're in such a hurry.

52:51.968 --> 52:56.200
I have other ways
of securing your cooperation.

52:56.273 --> 52:59.401
You're wasting your time. My
will is as strong as yours.

52:59.476 --> 53:01.967
Are you sure?

53:04.314 --> 53:07.044
Look into my eyes.

53:08.418 --> 53:10.352
Look!

53:23.867 --> 53:26.062
Deeper.

53:26.136 --> 53:29.105
Tell me what you see.

53:44.287 --> 53:48.849
Joan, Chick and I are gonna go into the
lockers and change into our costumes.

53:48.925 --> 53:51.189
Come on, Professor. We'll
meet you on the dance floor.

53:51.261 --> 53:53.752
Okay.

53:55.332 --> 53:57.357
What did I do?
What do you mean?

53:57.434 --> 53:59.368
He's dancing with my girl! So what?

53:59.436 --> 54:02.894
I'll show her!
I'm in love

54:02.973 --> 54:06.739
Aw, come on. Pick up those
bundles! Let's get dressed.

54:08.845 --> 54:11.712
So, it's you!
He knows me!

54:11.781 --> 54:14.306
McDougal! Listen, fat
boy, where are my exhibits?

54:14.384 --> 54:16.944
Leave him alone! Not until he
tells me where those exhibits are.

54:17.020 --> 54:19.989
Where are they?
Where are they?

54:20.056 --> 54:22.286
Aha! McDougal,
now we've got it on you.

54:22.359 --> 54:25.157
You put us in jail. Now we'll have
you arrested for assault and battery.

54:25.228 --> 54:27.219
See what good it'll do ya.
You haven't got a witness.

54:27.297 --> 54:29.322
I'm a witness! My word's as good as yours!

54:29.399 --> 54:32.129
Your word is better than
his. Keep outta this.

54:32.202 --> 54:35.069
I'll get a witness.
Do me a favor.

54:35.138 --> 54:37.265
Will you watch this?
I need a witness.

54:37.340 --> 54:40.537
Go ahead. I'd like to see you do it again.

54:40.610 --> 54:43.272
Did you see it?

54:43.346 --> 54:46.440
I'm sorry.
I couldn't see a thing.

54:48.852 --> 54:50.547
Thank you.

54:50.620 --> 54:53.248
Have you seen Chick Young
or Wilbur Gray?

54:53.323 --> 54:56.292
Seen them?
I don't even know them.

54:56.359 --> 55:00.352
I've got to know
what they found on that island.

55:00.430 --> 55:03.524
Chick! Wilbur! What did
you find? Was I right?

55:03.600 --> 55:07.366
No! And I wish you'd stop trying to
put those ideas in this boy's head.

55:07.437 --> 55:09.962
He's not used to them.
Go put your things on.

55:10.040 --> 55:11.974
Did you meet Dr. Lejos? Yes.

55:12.042 --> 55:16.308
What did he look like? Tall,
aristocratic, a faraway look in his eye?

55:16.379 --> 55:19.871
All I know is he told us to go out
and have some fun. Why don't you?

55:19.949 --> 55:23.385
Can't I convince you that Dracula
is a very dangerous person?

55:23.453 --> 55:28.322
You and Wilbur are just trying
to scare me. Well, it won't work!

55:29.826 --> 55:32.954
I scared ya.

55:33.029 --> 55:35.224
I scared ya, you big
sissy. This is your mask.

55:37.334 --> 55:40.997
No, no, no. Please don't
wear that. What's the matter?

55:41.071 --> 55:43.539
I know you'll think
I'm crazy, but...

55:43.606 --> 55:47.337
in a half an hour the moon will
rise and I'll turn into a wolf.

55:47.410 --> 55:50.311
You and 20 million other guys. Listen!

55:50.380 --> 55:53.679
I might tear you limb
from limb! Is that serious?

55:53.750 --> 55:56.446
He'll murder ya.!
That's serious.

55:56.519 --> 56:00.785
It won't be if you'll just
take me and lock me in my room.

56:00.857 --> 56:03.519
Please.
Oh, all right.

56:03.593 --> 56:06.118
Why don't you hire yourself
a keeper?

56:06.196 --> 56:08.892
Come on.

56:14.304 --> 56:16.534
Hey!

56:16.606 --> 56:19.871
Look.
Oh, Sandra's coming.

56:21.811 --> 56:26.009
Is it all clear?
I will take care of the girl.

56:26.082 --> 56:28.676
And you'll take Wilbur back
to the castle.

56:28.752 --> 56:32.085
Understand?
Yes, master.

56:35.125 --> 56:37.958
Sandra, you look...

56:38.027 --> 56:41.087
So... we meet again,
Count Dracula.

56:41.164 --> 56:43.928
Dracula? Yes. That's who he says you are.

56:44.000 --> 56:48.767
Oh, my costume perhaps. No, Talbot
thinks you're the real thing.

56:48.838 --> 56:50.772
Out of McDougal's
House of Horrors.

56:50.840 --> 56:53.673
What an odd
hallucination.

56:53.743 --> 56:57.907
But the human mind is often
inflamed with strange complexes.

56:57.981 --> 57:01.917
I suggest you consult
your physician, Mr. Talbot.

57:01.985 --> 57:04.249
And take him along with you,
please.

57:04.320 --> 57:06.652
So there you are!

57:06.723 --> 57:09.886
I'm glad to see
you've recovered.

57:09.959 --> 57:13.360
I didn't expect to see you here,
Doctor. Sandra insisted I come.

57:13.430 --> 57:17.867
I need a little relaxation. Miss
Raymond, would you honor me with a dance?

57:17.934 --> 57:20.334
No. No!

57:20.403 --> 57:23.372
I warn you.
He is Count Dracula!

57:23.440 --> 57:25.465
How interesting.
Tell me more.

57:25.542 --> 57:28.136
Let me tell you...
while we dance.

57:28.211 --> 57:30.304
Pardon me, Mr. Talbot.

57:31.581 --> 57:33.947
Sandra, do you feel
all right?

57:34.017 --> 57:37.817
Of course. But I must
obey my doctor's orders.

57:37.887 --> 57:41.687
Oh, sure! You gotta do
what the doctor tells ya.

57:41.758 --> 57:45.956
I intend to.
Let's have a walk, Wilbur.

57:46.029 --> 57:47.724
Toodle-oo.

57:47.797 --> 57:51.233
Professor,
do you understand women?

57:51.301 --> 57:54.361
I don't even try.
I'm gonna get me a drink.

58:09.886 --> 58:12.150
Sit here.

58:16.426 --> 58:19.987
Sandra, there's something strange
about ya. You're not yourself.

58:20.063 --> 58:22.156
Is there anything I can do to help? Yes.

58:22.232 --> 58:25.599
I want you to go away
with me to the island.

58:25.668 --> 58:27.898
Just me and you?
Yes.

58:27.971 --> 58:31.930
I want to be the only one in your
life. I want to be part of you.

58:32.008 --> 58:36.445
I want to be in your blood.

58:42.151 --> 58:44.779
I think I know
what you mean.

58:44.854 --> 58:49.086
Wouldn't you want a prettier fellow
than me? No. I want no one but you.

58:49.158 --> 58:53.185
You are so full-blooded,
so round, so firm.

58:53.263 --> 58:57.427
So fully packed. And I
want to stay that way.

58:57.500 --> 59:00.867
Aah!
Stuck myself.

59:00.937 --> 59:03.565
I'm bleedin'.
Let me see it.

59:03.640 --> 59:08.543
Uh-uh. There ain't enough for the two
of us... if that's what you're thinking.

59:08.611 --> 59:11.580
I'll tell you what I'm
thinking. Look into my eyes.

59:11.648 --> 59:15.607
I'm afraid to. There's
nothing to be afraid of.

59:15.685 --> 59:18.779
Look. Deeper.

59:18.855 --> 59:20.823
Deeper!

59:22.058 --> 59:23.821
Deeper.

59:38.374 --> 59:41.741
I looked deep enough.
I don't wanna look anymore.

59:41.811 --> 59:44.006
Of course you do.

59:44.080 --> 59:47.345
Don't you know what's going
to happen now? I'll bite.

59:47.417 --> 59:49.977
Oh, no... I will!

59:51.588 --> 59:54.182
Wilbur.! Wilbur.!
Joan.!

59:54.257 --> 59:58.125
Joan? There he is.
Wilbur, have you seen Joan?

59:58.194 --> 01:00:00.662
No, but I have definitely
made up my mind.

01:00:00.730 --> 01:00:03.164
You can have Sandra, but make
sure you've got plenty of bandages.

01:00:03.232 --> 01:00:05.700
Maybe Dracula lured Joan
into the woods.

01:00:05.768 --> 01:00:08.760
Chick, do you know what could happen
if I meet Dracula in the woods?

01:00:08.838 --> 01:00:11.534
I'll bite. Oh, no. You gotta stand in line.

01:00:11.608 --> 01:00:14.702
Let's not waste any time. Yeah, let's.

01:00:14.777 --> 01:00:18.213
Joan? Joan?

01:00:19.983 --> 01:00:22.918
Joan!
Chick, we can't find her.

01:00:22.986 --> 01:00:26.080
Let's keep on looking. Come on. Joan!

01:00:30.927 --> 01:00:32.952
Joan?

01:00:33.029 --> 01:00:36.863
Aw, Chick, we're
never gonna find her.

01:00:36.933 --> 01:00:39.094
Joan!

01:00:47.243 --> 01:00:49.837
Joan?

01:00:55.618 --> 01:00:58.246
Joan?

01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:07.725
Joan?

01:01:11.567 --> 01:01:14.092
Joan.!

01:01:16.239 --> 01:01:18.537
Joan.!

01:01:22.912 --> 01:01:26.245
Chick? Chick?

01:01:26.315 --> 01:01:29.216
Where did he go?
Chick!

01:01:29.285 --> 01:01:32.220
I'm gettin' tired
of lookin' forJoan.

01:01:34.657 --> 01:01:36.682
Look at him.

01:01:36.759 --> 01:01:39.819
Didn't Mr. Talbot tell you
not to put that mask on?

01:01:39.896 --> 01:01:42.922
What'd you
put it on for?

01:01:42.999 --> 01:01:45.797
Take the mask off!
Come on!

01:01:56.112 --> 01:01:58.444
Joan?

01:02:03.319 --> 01:02:06.652
Chick, what are you lookin' in there
for? You're not gonna find Joan in there.

01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:10.659
Now, come on, get up! Get
up! We gotta find Joan.

01:02:12.361 --> 01:02:16.354
Come on, Chick.
Now, take that mask off!

01:02:16.432 --> 01:02:18.423
Take it easy.
I'm your friend!

01:02:32.081 --> 01:02:34.174
Help.! Help.!

01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:36.411
Help.!

01:02:39.388 --> 01:02:42.118
The man's been hurt. Looks
like something attacked him.

01:02:42.191 --> 01:02:45.217
Get a doctor.

01:02:47.196 --> 01:02:51.326
You'll be all right, though another half
inch would have severed your jugular vein.

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:53.197
Get him up.

01:02:53.269 --> 01:02:56.761
Who did it? It was
somebody in a wolf's mask.

01:02:56.839 --> 01:02:59.967
McDougal,
what happened to you?

01:03:01.544 --> 01:03:05.776
You! It was you! He said
he was gonna get me. Me?

01:03:05.848 --> 01:03:08.146
That's right. I saw him arguing
with you earlier this evening.

01:03:08.217 --> 01:03:11.243
That's ridiculous.
I wouldn't...

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:14.551
People, real live people.
That's a boy. Tell 'em.

01:03:14.624 --> 01:03:17.593
Chick, what's the idea of
trying to take a bite out of me?

01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:20.493
What's the idea? What, did
he take a bite out of you too?

01:03:20.563 --> 01:03:22.497
What's the matter? You gone mad? Wilbur!

01:03:22.565 --> 01:03:24.590
Don't let that little fellow
fool you. He's an accomplice.

01:03:24.667 --> 01:03:27.101
Me?
Let's call the sheriff.

01:04:08.377 --> 01:04:11.574
Chick! Chick!
Oh, Chick!

01:04:12.648 --> 01:04:15.947
Chick!

01:04:16.018 --> 01:04:19.715
Joan, Joan, come on.
We gotta get outta here.

01:04:19.789 --> 01:04:21.518
Joan?

01:04:21.591 --> 01:04:25.027
Joan? Don't tell me
you've gone bats too.

01:04:25.094 --> 01:04:28.757
Wilbur.! Wilbur.!
Wilbur.!

01:05:30.626 --> 01:05:33.595
Chick! Chick!

01:05:33.663 --> 01:05:35.392
Chick, Chick.

01:05:35.464 --> 01:05:38.194
Quiet. They're after
me. After you? What for?

01:05:38.267 --> 01:05:41.134
McDougal was almost killed
last night by either a wolf...

01:05:41.203 --> 01:05:43.967
or a man wearing a mask
of a wolf!

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:45.974
It was a wolf.

01:05:46.042 --> 01:05:49.705
I'm going to give myself up.
It's the only way to clear you.

01:05:49.779 --> 01:05:53.408
Then... you were on the level
about that wolf business?

01:05:53.482 --> 01:05:57.384
Yes. I'm going to
surrender. You can't do that!

01:05:57.453 --> 01:06:01.480
Dracula's taken Wilbur and Joan
to the island. Are you sure?

01:06:01.557 --> 01:06:04.617
I saw what I saw
when I saw it!

01:06:06.963 --> 01:06:08.692
Hurry! Follow me!

01:06:28.784 --> 01:06:32.311
They may come back.
But Dracula?

01:06:32.388 --> 01:06:35.755
Dracula is helpless until after
nightfall. Maybe by then we'll...

01:06:35.825 --> 01:06:39.921
Okay. But after what I saw
there'd better not be any maybe.

01:06:41.931 --> 01:06:44.900
Sandra. Sandra?

01:06:44.967 --> 01:06:47.663
Sandra.!

01:06:49.305 --> 01:06:54.238
Junior?

01:06:56.178 --> 01:06:59.113
Junior.

01:06:59.181 --> 01:07:01.615
Will you help me
get outta here?

01:07:05.721 --> 01:07:12.393
Sandra!
Junior.

01:07:35.217 --> 01:07:39.813
Shall we begin?
I've been waiting, master.

01:07:39.889 --> 01:07:42.915
Sandra? Sandra?

01:07:53.602 --> 01:07:57.800
He's growing weaker! Will
he respond to the operation?

01:07:57.873 --> 01:08:01.536
If the generators are kept
going. We must start immediately.

01:08:01.610 --> 01:08:05.341
I'll get rid of Stevens,
and you'll take care of him.

01:08:07.817 --> 01:08:10.217
Sandra, what are you
gonna do?

01:08:10.286 --> 01:08:14.086
Don't worry. I'm not going
to hurt you. Thank you.

01:08:14.156 --> 01:08:16.624
Soon, instead of being
short and chubby,

01:08:16.692 --> 01:08:21.390
you'll be big and tall
and as strong as an ox.

01:08:23.666 --> 01:08:28.035
And furthermore, you'll live
forever and never grow old.

01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:30.265
Oh, Sandra,

01:08:30.339 --> 01:08:33.502
you still love me.

01:08:33.576 --> 01:08:38.343
But, Sandra, how are you gonna do all
these things? By a simple operation.

01:08:38.413 --> 01:08:43.647
I shall remove your brain
and put it in his body.

01:08:43.719 --> 01:08:46.950
You're gonna take my brain and
put it in Junior's body? Yes.

01:08:47.022 --> 01:08:50.514
Ha-ha! For a minute, I didn't
know how you were gonna do it!

01:08:50.593 --> 01:08:52.857
Agh!

01:09:03.037 --> 01:09:05.198
Good evening, Professor.

01:09:05.274 --> 01:09:09.108
Is everything under control?
Everything but my temper.

01:09:09.178 --> 01:09:11.840
I found Miss Raymond
in Dr. Mornay's room.

01:09:11.913 --> 01:09:15.542
You should mind
your own business, Professor.

01:09:15.618 --> 01:09:18.984
I also found this, which
is very much my business.

01:09:19.054 --> 01:09:22.148
And after I've taken Joan
back to town, I'm...

01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:27.156
Hmm. Excellent.

01:09:27.229 --> 01:09:31.393
Let's take him to the cellar. We can
dispose of all the bodies at the same time.

01:09:41.676 --> 01:09:45.545
Well, there's the boat.
Let's look around.

01:09:49.385 --> 01:09:52.046
Hey, that must be
the entrance to the castle.

01:09:52.121 --> 01:09:54.612
Come on.

01:10:34.196 --> 01:10:36.721
Come.

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:40.698
Lie down... here.

01:10:40.769 --> 01:10:44.136
Yes... master.

01:10:47.977 --> 01:10:50.502
Frankie, don't let 'em
do it to ya.

01:10:50.579 --> 01:10:53.104
Frankie boy.
Listen to me, Frankie.

01:10:53.182 --> 01:10:56.015
Don't let 'em
do it to ya!

01:10:56.085 --> 01:11:00.613
Frankie. Frankie! I'm
tellin' ya, it's a bad deal.

01:11:00.689 --> 01:11:04.716
I've had this brain for 30 years
and it hasn't worked right yet.

01:11:04.793 --> 01:11:07.284
Ask me how much one and one
is, Frankie. Go ahead, ask me.

01:11:07.363 --> 01:11:09.126
I don't know.

01:11:09.198 --> 01:11:11.632
We'll be right back, Wilbur.

01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:15.136
Okay, I'll wait.

01:11:37.126 --> 01:11:40.186
Chick! Dracula is Dracula! Wilbur!

01:11:40.262 --> 01:11:43.493
Sandra's gonna use my brain to make
a bigger dummy out of the other dummy.

01:11:43.565 --> 01:11:47.160
I'll get you out of this.
No kiddin'! Hurry up.

01:11:47.236 --> 01:11:50.399
All right.
Atta boy.

01:11:50.472 --> 01:11:53.134
Does it hurt? No, no. Go
ahead, a little harder.

01:11:56.712 --> 01:12:00.375
What's the matter? All right,
I'm doing the best I can!

01:12:01.917 --> 01:12:05.148
Wait a minute.
Oh, pardon me, I'm sorry.

01:12:08.824 --> 01:12:12.521
There you are. Now, get
outta here. Go ahead.

01:12:12.594 --> 01:12:16.155
Hey, not that way.
To the left!

01:12:21.570 --> 01:12:24.198
Get him out.
Get him out!

01:12:24.273 --> 01:12:28.437
No door. No door? Come on, get outta here!

01:12:34.583 --> 01:12:37.313
Take it easy,
you'll be all right.

01:12:37.386 --> 01:12:40.150
We gotta get back to the
castle. Joan's in there. Come on.

01:12:40.222 --> 01:12:42.918
Come on, Wilbur. Not me.
I'm not goin' back in there.

01:12:42.991 --> 01:12:45.186
I've got too much
of what they want: brains.

01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:47.455
Get the motor started in
the boat. Hurry up. Okay.

01:12:56.138 --> 01:12:58.197
They've escaped!

01:12:58.273 --> 01:13:02.107
You attend to the monster. I
can handle our fat friend. Come.

01:13:09.118 --> 01:13:10.710
Wilbur.

01:13:12.888 --> 01:13:16.085
Come back.

01:13:20.963 --> 01:13:22.897
Come.

01:13:28.570 --> 01:13:32.836
I said... come back!

01:13:40.482 --> 01:13:42.677
Come!

01:14:11.113 --> 01:14:13.138
Wilbur! We're all set.
You got the boat...

01:14:13.215 --> 01:14:15.877
Wilbur!
He's not here!

01:14:15.951 --> 01:14:18.511
Now where'd he go?

01:14:18.587 --> 01:14:20.384
Look!

01:14:22.224 --> 01:14:24.158
They started the operation.

01:14:24.226 --> 01:14:26.786
They must've found him.
We've gotta go back.

01:14:26.862 --> 01:14:29.797
You stay here with Joan.

01:15:00.729 --> 01:15:02.959
Please...
give me a little ether.

01:15:03.031 --> 01:15:06.091
We don't need it.
You won't feel a thing.

01:15:29.124 --> 01:15:32.093
Oh, boy,
am I glad to see you!

01:15:33.095 --> 01:15:35.120
Get me off here.

01:15:38.066 --> 01:15:41.399
What are you lookin'out the window
for? Somebody else comin'after me?

01:15:43.672 --> 01:15:45.697
Hmm?

01:16:10.465 --> 01:16:13.730
Hey!

01:16:19.074 --> 01:16:22.441
Chick, help! Please!

01:16:22.511 --> 01:16:24.877
Chick.!

01:16:46.902 --> 01:16:50.099
Chick! Chick!
Oh, Chick!

01:16:50.172 --> 01:16:52.299
Aah, Chick.!

01:16:54.376 --> 01:16:56.207
Chick!
Aah!

01:16:59.648 --> 01:17:01.843
Back.

01:17:01.917 --> 01:17:04.477
Back!

01:17:07.222 --> 01:17:09.486
Chick!
Come on!

01:17:09.558 --> 01:17:12.686
Chick, do you believe me now? Yes.

01:17:16.932 --> 01:17:18.627
Hurry up.

01:17:29.678 --> 01:17:32.772
Let's barricade the door.
Get it over there.

01:17:32.848 --> 01:17:34.782
Okay, come on.

01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:36.715
There.

01:17:36.785 --> 01:17:39.481
Put your shoulder to
the door. Hold it tight.

01:17:39.554 --> 01:17:43.820
We barricaded it.
He can't get in here!

01:17:47.629 --> 01:17:50.097
Come on, Wilbur!

01:17:51.767 --> 01:17:53.735
Come on!

01:18:07.783 --> 01:18:09.717
Help!

01:18:31.073 --> 01:18:33.564
Back.

01:18:34.710 --> 01:18:36.769
Back.

01:18:36.845 --> 01:18:39.871
Back.
Yes... master.

01:18:39.948 --> 01:18:42.473
He thinks I'm Dracula.

01:19:11.747 --> 01:19:14.375
Whew!
Well, we got him!

01:19:40.609 --> 01:19:43.703
Joan! Joan!

01:19:43.779 --> 01:19:46.976
Are you all right?
Mm-hmm.

01:20:16.711 --> 01:20:20.841
I gotcha. You're just the one we're
lookin' for. Still want your exhibits?

01:20:20.916 --> 01:20:23.908
Of course I do. Here comes one of'em now!

01:20:28.456 --> 01:20:30.515
Aah!

01:20:35.263 --> 01:20:37.959
Chick!
Come on, Wilbur!

01:20:44.906 --> 01:20:48.103
Fill that bucket
with gas.

01:20:49.511 --> 01:20:52.071
Untie the boat.

01:20:55.817 --> 01:20:58.752
Untie the boat!

01:21:07.262 --> 01:21:09.822
Untie the boat,
will ya?

01:21:09.898 --> 01:21:12.230
Untie the boat,
will ya please?

01:21:15.604 --> 01:21:18.129
Okay!

01:21:52.841 --> 01:21:56.004
He won't chase us anymore.
And another thing.

01:21:56.077 --> 01:21:58.443
The next time I tell you that
I saw something when I saw it,

01:21:58.513 --> 01:22:02.210
you believe me that I saw it! Oh, relax.

01:22:02.284 --> 01:22:05.412
Now that we've seen the last of
Dracula, the Wolfman and the Monster,

01:22:05.487 --> 01:22:07.455
there's nobody
to frighten us anymore.

01:22:07.522 --> 01:22:10.423
That's too bad. I was hoping
to get in on the excitement.

01:22:10.492 --> 01:22:14.826
Who said that? Allow me to introduce
myself. I'm the Invisible Man.
