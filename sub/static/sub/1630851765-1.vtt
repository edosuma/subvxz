WEBVTT

01:43.530 --> 01:45.690
Wait, so tell me, baby.

01:45.730 --> 01:49.450
We're going to check out an old
abandoned building that we found.

01:51.290 --> 01:54.410
It's an abandoned sanatorium
that locals claim is haunted.

01:54.450 --> 01:58.250
Literally, only this guy
can find places like this.

01:58.290 --> 02:00.730
- Wow.
- And all these open windows.

02:00.770 --> 02:02.530
I can't wait to go inside.

02:03.490 --> 02:06.730
- I hope there are no snakes here.
- No, don't worry.

02:08.930 --> 02:11.010
Watch out, behind you.

02:26.410 --> 02:31.090
- Ben, did you find the stairs?
- No, Tina. Not yet.

02:31.530 --> 02:33.690
- Be careful.
- Ok.

02:39.490 --> 02:42.570
- What happened here?
- In the 70s,

02:42.610 --> 02:45.850
a nurse poisoned several children
before taking her own life.

02:46.730 --> 02:48.890
- How many children?
- Seven.

02:48.930 --> 02:50.850
Sanatorium was closed down just after.

02:51.370 --> 02:55.530
Ever since, supposedly, the nurse
haunts the hallways and rooms

02:55.570 --> 02:57.050
looking for someone to poison.

02:57.090 --> 02:59.410
Fuck ghosts, right?

03:07.330 --> 03:09.650
What was that?

03:11.610 --> 03:13.010
It's just the wind.

03:14.370 --> 03:16.330
Let's go that way.

03:16.370 --> 03:19.090
Ben, wait for me. It's fucking scary.

03:24.330 --> 03:26.130
Ben!

03:31.690 --> 03:32.690
Ben?

03:33.930 --> 03:34.930
Ben?

03:46.370 --> 03:47.370
Ben!

03:48.650 --> 03:51.650
I'm kind of freaked out.
I'm not really in the mood to...

03:52.770 --> 03:53.770
Play.

03:56.530 --> 03:58.010
Boo!

03:58.650 --> 04:01.090
- Gotcha.
- You're so annoying.

04:01.130 --> 04:03.330
I'm sorry, baby.

04:58.810 --> 05:00.930
I look awful in the morning.

05:00.970 --> 05:03.810
Well, I think you look sexy as hell

05:03.850 --> 05:04.930
and it's noon.

05:06.930 --> 05:07.930
What was your time?

05:09.610 --> 05:11.770
- Uh, what did you say?
- What was your time?

05:12.690 --> 05:15.130
Oh, I don't know, maybe three minutes.

05:17.170 --> 05:18.930
That's it?

05:18.970 --> 05:20.650
What do you mean "that's it"?

05:20.690 --> 05:23.330
We're going scuba diving,
not snorkelling.

05:25.970 --> 05:27.090
Nervous?

05:27.130 --> 05:30.450
Yeah. Maybe a little.

05:30.490 --> 05:34.250
You've got this. And three minutes
is actually really good.

05:34.290 --> 05:35.850
Especially in a bathtub.

05:44.290 --> 05:46.570
Just think of the lake
as one big bathtub.

05:46.610 --> 05:47.610
Reflex.

05:48.930 --> 05:51.370
You're such a dick. You're driving.

06:56.930 --> 06:59.850
You can tell it's summer
by the fact the hay has been brought in

06:59.890 --> 07:01.530
and taken into bales.

07:02.450 --> 07:05.530
And there's
a wonderful river valley below.

07:11.570 --> 07:12.810
Oh, my god.

07:12.850 --> 07:14.730
Ben, what the fuck? Stop it.

08:19.570 --> 08:22.850
- What does the GPS say?
- It says that we're here.

08:26.490 --> 08:28.050
I mean, we're lost.

08:28.530 --> 08:30.890
Well, it wouldn't exactly
be easy to find

08:30.930 --> 08:34.330
if it was really
such a super-secret spot, would it?

08:34.370 --> 08:37.250
Guess that means
I gotta go ask someone.

08:47.410 --> 08:50.210
So here we are
in south west France.

08:51.050 --> 08:52.730
A very typical...

08:53.650 --> 08:56.210
In my opinion, slightly dying village.

08:56.810 --> 09:00.090
And here's
a classic world war two monument.

09:00.130 --> 09:02.730
You notice a lot of the names
are shared.

09:02.770 --> 09:07.610
So there was few families here, which
lost a lot of their favourite sons.

09:08.930 --> 09:11.610
As I said, it's sort of a dying village
because you'll notice

09:11.650 --> 09:14.730
a lot of the houses on this main square
have for sale signs in them.

09:17.370 --> 09:19.810
Doesn't appear
to be many people around and...

09:21.050 --> 09:23.210
This one's also for sale.

09:23.250 --> 09:26.330
You can notice in the architecture
of the small window up by the attic

09:26.370 --> 09:28.650
which would often be used
as a storeroom.

09:28.690 --> 09:31.810
They would have often had
a joist and a pulley system

09:31.850 --> 09:34.930
to bring the bags of grain up
and stored in the attic.

09:45.250 --> 09:46.850
Fruit.

09:54.850 --> 09:56.690
Let me guess, they've never heard of it.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.050
Actually they said that...

09:59.970 --> 10:01.250
So...

10:01.290 --> 10:04.530
- We can't see it?
- No, we can't miss it.

10:09.610 --> 10:11.490
Not so secret spot, huh?

10:13.290 --> 10:14.650
Fuck's sake.

10:23.370 --> 10:25.170
<i>Oh, it's really creepy over there.</i>

10:25.210 --> 10:27.290
<i>- It's really creepy everywhere.
- I know.</i>

10:37.290 --> 10:40.970
- 50,000 views on the sanatorium video.
- So?

10:41.810 --> 10:43.210
I want more.

10:44.210 --> 10:46.570
Every dickhead with a gopro
is down there.

10:48.570 --> 10:50.650
Well, that's a bit ironic, isn't it?

10:58.650 --> 11:01.610
Tb urbex isn't exactly going
to break the Internet today.

11:02.130 --> 11:03.490
So what?

11:03.530 --> 11:06.290
I thought the whole point was
to get out of the library,

11:06.330 --> 11:09.490
stop reading about those things,
start living them.

11:09.530 --> 11:11.490
You're acting like a little baby.

11:11.930 --> 11:14.450
You're just relieved
you won't have to dive.

11:17.410 --> 11:20.770
Sorry, look, I-I-I know
you trained really hard for this.

11:21.450 --> 11:23.450
Why don't we just be tourists
for the day?

11:24.810 --> 11:27.690
Do that boat thing, lay on the beach.

11:32.810 --> 11:37.210
- We're going to need wine though.
- Oh, thank you for this.

11:58.570 --> 12:02.930
Ben, please don't invite him over
for a drink. Please.

12:16.570 --> 12:17.890
Thank you.

12:23.050 --> 12:24.450
New friend?

12:25.970 --> 12:27.130
Pierre.

12:27.170 --> 12:30.330
He tells me there's nothing
but ruins and shit down there.

12:30.370 --> 12:33.450
Apparently all the houses were
destroyed before the flood, so...

12:33.490 --> 12:36.050
Even without all those tourists,
frais lake was...

12:36.090 --> 12:37.970
Never really worth our time.

12:39.130 --> 12:41.570
If only we could have found out
beforehand.

12:41.610 --> 12:45.170
Well, this part of the lake's
not worth our time.

12:46.250 --> 12:49.410
For a relatively small fee,
Pierre's offered to take us

12:49.450 --> 12:53.570
to an isolated arm of the lake
that runs deep into the woods.

12:53.610 --> 12:55.570
Apparently it's very difficult to access

12:55.610 --> 12:57.570
and according to him
a proper secret spot.

12:57.610 --> 13:00.010
I thought we agreed
to just be tourists for the day.

13:00.050 --> 13:04.090
I know. But listen, babe, at
the bottom of this part of the lake...

13:06.490 --> 13:09.650
- Come on. You're being annoying.
- There's a perfectly preserved house.

13:51.930 --> 13:54.650
"Forest cantaloupe."

13:54.690 --> 13:56.170
<i>Chanteloup.</i>

13:56.210 --> 13:58.890
- It means singing wolf.
- Cool name.

13:58.930 --> 14:02.490
Erm, and what about the house's area?
What's it called?

14:02.810 --> 14:05.090
Nothing. It's not on any map.

14:07.450 --> 14:11.850
The region suffered a series of
devastating floods about 50 years ago.

14:12.970 --> 14:16.330
Then construction to control
the water flow began in, er...

14:16.370 --> 14:19.890
1984. Wikipedia.

14:19.930 --> 14:23.050
- Go on, Pierre.
- The village was emptied.

14:24.050 --> 14:26.370
The valley voluntarily flooded.

14:26.890 --> 14:28.890
And that's how frais lake came to be.

14:29.330 --> 14:32.090
With a pack of tourists like you
come to dive there since.

15:21.290 --> 15:24.730
Guys. Do I need
to, erm, pay for subtitles here?

15:26.050 --> 15:30.250
I was saying that we'll have to cover
the last couple of miles by foot.

15:44.250 --> 15:46.770
We're not gonna go viral by...

16:16.010 --> 16:19.210
It's a long way,
but I promise it's worth it.

16:26.890 --> 16:29.490
Watch where you put your feet,
darling.

16:29.530 --> 16:32.730
- Why? Do you think there are snakes?
- You'll see.

16:34.250 --> 16:37.170
So he is the bold one
and you're the scared one.

16:37.210 --> 16:40.330
Yeah, I can get nervous
but I'm working on it.

17:09.210 --> 17:10.290
<i>Voil√†.</i>

17:24.570 --> 17:27.090
Repairs to the hf seem to have worked,

17:27.129 --> 17:28.850
so we shouldn't lose sound this time.

17:34.690 --> 17:35.850
What is that thing?

17:37.690 --> 17:40.850
It's, er, my drone. His name's Tom.

17:41.810 --> 17:43.130
Tom.

17:43.930 --> 17:45.450
Like a peeping Tom.

17:46.250 --> 17:47.770
Someone who likes to watch.

17:49.490 --> 17:51.770
It's gonna follow us
everywhere shooting in 4k.

17:51.810 --> 17:53.250
Four what?

17:55.770 --> 17:57.450
Nice sticker.

18:01.010 --> 18:03.570
Cross of nero.
Symbolizes the death christendom.

18:03.610 --> 18:06.690
Those hippies didn't know that
when they chose it as their symbol.

18:09.730 --> 18:12.090
You didn't want
to tell me that beforehand?

18:12.130 --> 18:14.250
- What does it mean?
- Peace and evil, darling.

18:20.570 --> 18:22.410
What did you say?

18:22.450 --> 18:26.490
All I heard was like,
"mort blah blah blah."

18:29.290 --> 18:30.530
Nothing.

18:31.530 --> 18:32.930
Drop it.

18:37.890 --> 18:40.330
Just an old family motto.

18:52.370 --> 18:56.490
You got 60 minutes of air and
you can hold your breath close to three.

18:56.530 --> 18:58.290
You've got this.

18:58.330 --> 19:00.690
We're going to be in and out. I promise.

19:00.730 --> 19:03.810
We'll get back to New York,
we'll edit the footage.

19:03.850 --> 19:05.570
Once we reach our first million views,

19:05.610 --> 19:09.090
we're going straight
to the littlest chapel in Vegas.

19:09.130 --> 19:11.050
A drive-through wedding.

19:14.450 --> 19:15.690
Ok.

19:21.370 --> 19:24.770
Just below,
it's the perfect spot to propose.

19:24.810 --> 19:26.530
You swim straight for 50 minutes.

19:26.570 --> 19:28.250
You cannot miss it.

19:28.290 --> 19:30.010
Follow the stairs down.

19:31.730 --> 19:32.850
The stairs?

19:56.770 --> 19:58.490
Sound test. Say something, Tina.

19:58.530 --> 20:01.130
That guy gave me the creeps.

20:01.370 --> 20:04.130
I hear you loud and clear.

20:04.170 --> 20:07.690
- Let's go.
- He kept staring at me.

20:08.890 --> 20:10.290
Watch out, shark.

20:10.330 --> 20:14.970
No, I'm serious.
On the way back, you drive next to him.

20:15.010 --> 20:16.090
Sure.

20:16.130 --> 20:19.650
- Unless he's already left with the Van.
- What?

20:21.890 --> 20:23.690
Just kidding. I got the keys.

20:35.810 --> 20:38.770
So here we are in the lac du frais.

20:38.810 --> 20:40.250
Visibility is pretty good.

20:40.810 --> 20:43.890
We're reaching
the first plateau ten meters down.

20:48.370 --> 20:49.410
Ben!

20:50.050 --> 20:51.210
Ben!

20:51.850 --> 20:55.210
- What?
- Look! My fin. It's stuck.

20:59.130 --> 21:02.050
Oh, shit. Come on. Help me.

21:02.090 --> 21:05.930
Wait here and I'll come
pick you up on the way back.

21:12.850 --> 21:15.850
Shut up. Let's keep going.

21:24.370 --> 21:25.450
Hey, look.

21:26.090 --> 21:28.810
Wow, it's a rover.

21:28.850 --> 21:30.850
A rover p6, even.

21:31.770 --> 21:33.530
It's in great condition.

21:34.090 --> 21:35.530
Amazing.

21:35.570 --> 21:39.490
- You ever see anything like it?
- It's fairly common in lakes.

21:40.290 --> 21:41.850
It's not sea water, you know.

21:43.090 --> 21:48.010
- Made in britain, baby, just like me.
- Yeah and pig's blood pudding.

21:48.490 --> 21:50.930
Ah. Touch√©.

21:52.450 --> 21:54.330
Will you put a song on?

22:01.290 --> 22:03.370
Jesus. Ben!

22:03.410 --> 22:04.690
What? You don't like it?

22:14.610 --> 22:15.610
Better?

22:50.690 --> 22:53.850
"Follow the stairs down."

23:11.330 --> 23:14.250
Wow. There she is.

23:19.450 --> 23:21.250
More than 30 meters down.

23:22.490 --> 23:25.250
We see before us
the gates to the property.

23:32.130 --> 23:34.890
I forgot how superstitious
people are in these parts.

23:34.930 --> 23:36.450
No kidding.

23:42.570 --> 23:46.810
- Oh, no! No trespassing I guess.
- Yep. Shall we go back up?

23:46.850 --> 23:48.650
Nice try, baby.

23:49.530 --> 23:51.610
Come on. Let's do it.

23:55.730 --> 23:59.930
So weird. All the fish have gone.

24:00.610 --> 24:03.050
Maybe the no trespassing sign
was for them.

24:06.050 --> 24:08.570
That man Pierre is full of shit.

24:08.610 --> 24:11.450
- It's not a house. It's a shed.
- No, silly.

24:11.490 --> 24:14.330
It's a crypt. Montegnac.

24:14.370 --> 24:16.370
Private mausoleum in the garden.

24:16.410 --> 24:18.570
- Must've been well off.
- What's wrong with the song?

24:18.610 --> 24:21.850
Turn it off.

24:32.410 --> 24:35.290
No. No, no, no,
don't do that. It's bad luck.

24:35.330 --> 24:37.370
You're way too superstitious.

24:38.050 --> 24:40.970
God is watching over us.

24:41.010 --> 24:42.450
- Stop it.
- Inri.

24:42.490 --> 24:44.050
Stop!

24:44.410 --> 24:48.970
Inri...

24:54.050 --> 24:57.490
This place is massive.
Lots to discover, I bet.

24:58.730 --> 25:00.450
Come on, Tina.

25:07.250 --> 25:09.930
It's unbelievable.

25:27.570 --> 25:31.090
It's steel. And sealed shut.

25:31.130 --> 25:33.610
It's all right.
We'll find a way in.

25:33.650 --> 25:35.050
Let's split up.

26:06.450 --> 26:08.210
It's completely shuttered up.

26:08.810 --> 26:11.610
But why shutter a house
that's going to get flooded?

26:11.930 --> 26:13.610
Let's find out.

26:17.930 --> 26:18.970
Upstairs.

26:27.890 --> 26:30.090
Same deal.

26:30.130 --> 26:33.050
There's no way to pry these windows
open from the outside.

26:38.690 --> 26:42.210
If you want to try the chimney,
you're going down first.

26:43.410 --> 26:44.890
No need.

26:48.450 --> 26:50.050
<i>Voil√†!</i>

26:53.010 --> 26:54.370
Shit!

26:56.490 --> 26:59.970
The bastard better not
have knackered my drone. You're right.

27:00.010 --> 27:01.130
Yeah.

27:01.890 --> 27:04.970
Top scares get the maximum likes.

27:05.010 --> 27:07.690
- I just hope you got that on camera.
- Oh, yeah, I got it.

27:08.450 --> 27:10.330
Send in the drone.

27:20.210 --> 27:21.370
Out of the way.

28:00.290 --> 28:02.050
Must be the attic.

28:05.530 --> 28:07.850
But they left all the furniture.

28:21.210 --> 28:23.650
Raise your glass to our discovery.

28:23.690 --> 28:24.930
Look.

28:28.930 --> 28:31.610
- I loved these as a kid.
- So pretty.

28:32.290 --> 28:35.410
‚ô™ <i>Jingle bells, jingle bells</i>

28:38.290 --> 28:39.290
insane.

28:42.730 --> 28:45.610
Hm, my grandma had one just like that.

28:49.930 --> 28:51.450
That's so cool.

28:54.010 --> 28:55.290
Yeah.

29:00.370 --> 29:01.690
Fuck!

29:01.730 --> 29:03.250
- What?
- Fuck.

29:03.970 --> 29:06.570
Oh, my god,
that scared the hell out of me.

29:06.610 --> 29:09.450
Cool. Creepy dolls always work.

29:09.490 --> 29:10.930
Oh.

29:14.450 --> 29:15.450
Air?

29:16.370 --> 29:18.290
I have 87 percent left.

29:18.330 --> 29:22.530
- Eighty four percent for me.
- Right. Breathe a little slower. Ok?

29:22.570 --> 29:24.570
Ok.

29:25.610 --> 29:26.610
Good.

29:29.210 --> 29:32.770
Relax. The house doesn't look too big.

29:32.810 --> 29:34.610
It won't take us long.

29:54.050 --> 29:55.050
Jesus.

30:01.770 --> 30:02.850
Come on.

30:10.130 --> 30:12.050
It's pitch black.
I can't see a thing.

30:12.690 --> 30:17.370
- Ladies first.
- Very funny. Send in the drone.

30:23.330 --> 30:26.370
Let's see what the sonar says.

30:41.690 --> 30:43.290
What did you say?

30:43.330 --> 30:44.770
- Nothing.
- What?

30:45.050 --> 30:48.490
- I heard a voice.
- Must have been interference.

30:48.530 --> 30:51.370
Like long frequency,
a radio or plane or something.

31:05.690 --> 31:07.930
Absence of echo means nothing there.

31:07.970 --> 31:10.410
No fish, no doll to leap out at you.

31:10.450 --> 31:11.850
We can proceed.

31:20.450 --> 31:22.210
Oh, that's cool.

31:41.930 --> 31:44.690
They look like a bunch of freaks.

31:45.130 --> 31:48.170
I'd say they look like
your average French family.

31:48.210 --> 31:49.530
Shut up!

32:00.690 --> 32:02.450
Tina, quick selfie for our followers.

32:02.490 --> 32:06.090
Ugh. Does it have to be
in front of a dead animal?

32:06.130 --> 32:08.450
For our followers.
It's just a skull.

32:08.490 --> 32:10.490
Are you pitching to hunters now?

32:11.970 --> 32:14.530
Tb urbex. Comment, like...

32:14.570 --> 32:15.730
Share.

32:21.210 --> 32:23.050
I don't like this place.

32:24.290 --> 32:27.290
I don't like it either. I love it.

32:31.610 --> 32:34.290
This could be the door
to a million views.

32:54.210 --> 32:56.690
This house was underwater
before I was even born.

32:56.730 --> 33:00.050
I mean,
how is this stuff not all decayed?

33:13.850 --> 33:16.330
What kind of kids were those?

33:18.450 --> 33:19.810
Weird kids.

33:22.890 --> 33:25.410
Tina, check me out.

33:26.490 --> 33:27.890
Yee-ha!

33:27.930 --> 33:30.890
No, no, no. Stop.
Come on. Have a little respect.

33:30.930 --> 33:32.570
- Great shot, right?
- Sure.

33:32.610 --> 33:35.970
- What do you think?
- Your followers will love it.

33:37.250 --> 33:39.610
Fuck! Tina.

33:41.690 --> 33:42.730
- What?
- Look.

33:44.130 --> 33:45.850
There's someone behind that.

33:46.450 --> 33:48.050
What are you talking about?

33:57.450 --> 33:59.930
You're freaking me out
with your stupid pranks.

33:59.970 --> 34:01.170
Shit, the light.

34:01.810 --> 34:03.450
Switch that back on.

34:03.490 --> 34:05.770
It's not me, I swear.
I didn't touch a thing.

34:05.810 --> 34:08.729
For fuck sake, Ben. If you're trying
to freak me out, I promise you...

34:18.689 --> 34:21.769
Tina, honestly, I saw human silhouette.

34:22.530 --> 34:24.289
You didn't see it?

34:24.330 --> 34:27.249
- Knock it off. You're freaking me out.
- Ok. Sorry.

34:28.610 --> 34:31.610
It was most likely nothing.
Just a shadow.

34:32.410 --> 34:34.450
You dick. Don't even do that.

34:34.490 --> 34:38.370
What's up with Tom?
Jesus, Tom. Don't do this shit to me.

34:43.209 --> 34:46.289
- Maybe the fish damaged it.
- Maybe.

34:58.850 --> 35:00.010
I rebooted him.

35:00.850 --> 35:03.290
I hope he holds out
till the end of the dive.

35:07.290 --> 35:08.930
Moving on.

35:08.970 --> 35:10.570
Heading downstairs.

35:39.450 --> 35:41.730
Hey. It's the front door.

35:50.210 --> 35:54.450
- What are those marks?
- They look like... scratches.

35:55.690 --> 35:56.850
What the hell?

35:57.090 --> 35:58.770
Fuck.

35:58.810 --> 36:02.050
Like someone was trapped
inside the house.

36:04.770 --> 36:06.370
What was that?

36:07.610 --> 36:09.170
A piano?

36:09.210 --> 36:12.290
- Another diver?
- I don't know.

36:18.290 --> 36:20.570
Do you think
it's Pierre messing with us?

36:21.530 --> 36:23.210
I haven't got a clue.

37:09.130 --> 37:11.370
Tom's detecting movement.

37:14.290 --> 37:15.770
It just stopped.

37:23.770 --> 37:25.450
Let's take a look-see.

37:44.570 --> 37:46.290
What is moving?

37:47.010 --> 37:50.170
I don't understand. I see nothing.

37:51.130 --> 37:54.690
I don't get it.
Is it us that's setting him off?

37:55.530 --> 37:58.850
Impossible.
Tom has us in his parameters.

38:13.610 --> 38:17.050
Must have been a fish.
Came down the chimney.

38:18.450 --> 38:20.130
And the piano?

38:20.170 --> 38:23.490
Most likely it was a string
that snapped from the corrosion.

38:23.530 --> 38:25.090
You can try explain it away,

38:25.130 --> 38:28.130
but there's something
very wrong with this place.

38:28.170 --> 38:31.690
Ben, the shadow, the scratches
on the door, the weird sounds.

38:31.730 --> 38:34.850
- Everything's weird underwater.
- Ben, admit it!

38:36.450 --> 38:37.930
Yeah, it's pretty freaky.

38:39.530 --> 38:41.770
But this is an absolute first.

38:41.810 --> 38:44.770
There's no such thing
as haunted houses.

38:44.810 --> 38:46.970
Sure, yeah.
There's some weird stuff going on.

38:47.010 --> 38:50.090
But just imagine the mad film
we're going to bring back.

38:50.130 --> 38:51.930
We're not in any kind of danger.

38:52.530 --> 38:54.250
But now we're here, honestly...

38:55.570 --> 38:58.170
Don't you want to go a bit further?

38:58.210 --> 38:59.690
Sure.

39:06.130 --> 39:09.290
I mean, there can't
be many rooms left to see.

39:11.690 --> 39:14.690
With what just happened, I cannot lie,

39:15.610 --> 39:17.330
we're starting to freak out.

39:17.930 --> 39:19.970
The adrenaline is pumping.

39:20.850 --> 39:23.450
And we continue our exploration.

39:25.530 --> 39:27.570
So we reach the next room.

39:35.930 --> 39:38.570
- Are those what I think they are?
- Yeah.

39:39.770 --> 39:41.770
Missing people posters.

39:43.010 --> 39:46.770
- And it's all kids.
- What kind of freaks collect those?

40:07.770 --> 40:09.330
Here's the kitchen.

40:32.170 --> 40:34.090
Oh, shit. It's down again.

40:34.130 --> 40:37.250
- Sure the batteries aren't dead?
- They're brand new.

40:38.370 --> 40:39.810
Shit!

40:41.130 --> 40:44.610
- What the hell was that?
- No idea.

41:25.170 --> 41:26.610
Holy shit.

41:29.930 --> 41:32.770
What the hell
is that doing in a kitchen?

41:40.210 --> 41:42.890
There's a door behind it.
Come on, Teenie.

41:42.930 --> 41:44.450
What if it's a secret room?

41:47.290 --> 41:49.290
What the fuck are we doing?

41:53.450 --> 41:55.970
Come on. Give me a hand.

41:58.330 --> 42:00.250
Yeah, I got it.

42:02.210 --> 42:03.770
Pull on that side.

42:06.530 --> 42:07.690
Pull it up.

42:25.210 --> 42:27.730
Promise me
this is the last room we explore.

42:27.770 --> 42:28.850
I promise.

42:44.770 --> 42:46.490
It's too dark.

42:47.770 --> 42:50.010
I can't see a thing down here.

42:51.050 --> 42:52.450
The water's too murky.

42:53.010 --> 42:55.090
It's useless.

42:55.130 --> 42:56.690
I'll send the drone.

43:19.530 --> 43:22.610
We'll be fine. Ok?

43:22.890 --> 43:25.050
Come on. Let's go.

43:51.770 --> 43:53.090
Look at this.

43:53.850 --> 43:55.850
What's with all the video gear?

43:57.130 --> 43:58.610
It's film.

43:59.730 --> 44:00.730
Super 8.

44:01.650 --> 44:02.810
Wait.

44:02.850 --> 44:05.250
There was lots of film
in the kids' bedroom, too.

44:07.010 --> 44:09.490
What kind of stuff were they filming?

44:16.170 --> 44:17.690
What the fuck is that?

44:29.770 --> 44:32.650
That's it. I'm out.
We're going back up.

44:32.690 --> 44:34.010
Ok.

44:34.050 --> 44:35.650
You're right. Let's go.

44:40.330 --> 44:41.330
Ben!

44:41.730 --> 44:44.250
We'll go, we'll go.
Just a few more shots.

44:44.290 --> 44:48.090
Just two minutes, no more.
Please, Tina. Wait for me here.

44:48.130 --> 44:51.290
Ok, two shots,
and we're out of here, Ben. Two.

44:52.650 --> 44:53.770
Ok.

45:01.650 --> 45:04.730
They must've been chained up
down here before it was all flooded.

45:04.770 --> 45:07.170
Chained up alive. Why?

45:07.210 --> 45:09.290
I guess the answer is under there.

45:16.810 --> 45:18.450
A pentagram.

45:20.250 --> 45:22.050
That's satanic shit.

45:23.810 --> 45:25.970
And the masks, too?

45:26.010 --> 45:29.210
They look like torture masks
from the middle ages.

45:33.570 --> 45:35.250
Who are they?

45:35.890 --> 45:39.250
And how come they're... intact?

45:39.290 --> 45:40.770
I have no idea.

45:42.810 --> 45:45.770
You think
that's because of the lake water, too?

45:45.810 --> 45:48.970
It's impossible.
They should be skeletons.

45:49.010 --> 45:51.570
What the...

46:02.770 --> 46:06.970
- What are you doing?
- Stay here. I'll just take a look.

46:07.010 --> 46:09.130
Ben, don't leave me alone.

46:09.850 --> 46:11.450
Don't worry.

46:12.130 --> 46:13.410
I'm here.

46:26.370 --> 46:27.770
Do you see anything?

46:34.930 --> 46:36.170
Fuck.

46:37.050 --> 46:38.930
What? What's wrong?

46:42.130 --> 46:43.130
Ben.

46:45.370 --> 46:49.130
- Ben! Ben, come back.
- Ok.

46:50.130 --> 46:51.530
Now!

46:55.450 --> 46:57.330
What was behind the door?

46:57.890 --> 47:01.050
Nothing. Just more cameras.

47:22.450 --> 47:24.490
- We're calling the cops.
- No.

47:25.090 --> 47:26.810
They'll confiscate our memory cards.

47:26.850 --> 47:30.850
This is more than a flooded house, Ben.
It's a crime scene.

47:32.010 --> 47:33.370
Oh, my god!

47:46.290 --> 47:48.890
Look!
There's a fucking brick wall.

47:51.770 --> 47:52.770
How?

47:53.770 --> 47:54.850
No.

47:56.450 --> 47:57.970
- No.
- Stop, Tina.

47:58.010 --> 47:59.930
No, no, no, no.

47:59.970 --> 48:01.770
- We're trapped!
- Stop, Tina!

48:01.810 --> 48:03.330
We're never gonna get out!

48:03.650 --> 48:06.690
- Maybe we got the wrong room.
- Bullshit!

48:06.730 --> 48:09.090
- Tina, look at me. Calm down.
- No, no, no.

48:09.130 --> 48:12.090
- Look! You can see.
- You're breathing air way too fast.

48:12.130 --> 48:15.450
- How the fuck did that get here?
- No idea. Please.

48:16.290 --> 48:17.930
Calm down.

48:17.970 --> 48:21.450
- Breathe slowly.
- Ok.

48:21.490 --> 48:24.850
Otherwise we won't have time
for our stops on the ascent.

48:24.890 --> 48:26.770
- Ok?
- Ok.

48:26.810 --> 48:29.930
It's gonna be fine.
Breathe like me.

48:33.530 --> 48:35.050
There's someone there!

48:35.650 --> 48:37.930
- Oh, my god, I saw someone.
- Where?

48:40.690 --> 48:43.930
- There! Right behind you!
- There's nothing there.

48:43.970 --> 48:46.370
- There, there.
- Are you sure?

48:47.010 --> 48:48.370
The house.

48:48.410 --> 48:49.490
No.

48:49.530 --> 48:51.210
The house is haunted, Ben.

48:51.250 --> 48:53.690
- Could be.
- Then we're never gonna get out.

48:53.730 --> 48:55.690
We're never gonna get out.

48:57.610 --> 48:59.330
We're gonna drown.

49:01.130 --> 49:03.570
- I don't want to die.
- We're going to get out, Tina. Ok?

49:04.370 --> 49:07.050
Let's go back down. Try the windows.

49:07.890 --> 49:09.010
Ok.

49:09.050 --> 49:11.010
Control your breathing.

49:12.050 --> 49:15.330
It's going to be just fine.
Just take my hand.

49:15.370 --> 49:16.610
Ok.

49:54.250 --> 49:55.930
- What's going on?
- Fuck!

49:56.770 --> 50:00.770
- It won't fucking break.
- Oh, no. Oh, no.

50:00.810 --> 50:03.970
- I'll try and open the shutters.
- Ok, ok.

50:24.610 --> 50:26.210
Oh, shit!

50:29.250 --> 50:30.890
Oh, Ben! Ben!

50:35.130 --> 50:36.130
Ben! The fish!

50:37.370 --> 50:38.330
The fish.

50:38.370 --> 50:40.450
- What?
- The fish, it's back.

50:41.610 --> 50:43.450
There must be another way in.

50:45.850 --> 50:49.530
- Ok. Can you see it?
- There, it went into the kitchen.

50:52.690 --> 50:54.570
Wait, wait. There it is.

51:08.010 --> 51:09.690
You're going back down there?

51:10.690 --> 51:12.050
It's our only hope.

51:25.130 --> 51:27.410
- Holy shit.
- What?

51:27.810 --> 51:29.730
- What is it?
- Nothing.

51:30.130 --> 51:34.730
- You see it?
- No! I lost it!

51:46.890 --> 51:48.410
Oh, shit!

51:49.170 --> 51:52.050
It found an opening
but it's too small for us.

51:58.050 --> 51:59.930
Why did you put the music back on?

52:00.850 --> 52:02.730
- What music?
- Turn it off.

52:03.370 --> 52:04.370
It's not me.

52:11.370 --> 52:12.450
There's a well.

52:13.370 --> 52:14.370
Fuck!

52:20.930 --> 52:22.570
There's a grate.

52:23.690 --> 52:26.050
Jesus, Ben! Turn it off!

52:31.290 --> 52:32.770
Ben?

52:34.930 --> 52:37.770
Ben? The couple...

52:37.810 --> 52:39.410
Ben, the couple disappeared.

52:39.850 --> 52:41.250
Ben, talk to me!

52:42.450 --> 52:45.010
Ben! Ben, talk to me!

52:47.290 --> 52:48.290
Ben!

53:18.930 --> 53:20.130
Ben!

53:51.850 --> 53:53.410
Help!

54:01.730 --> 54:02.730
Tina!

54:09.290 --> 54:11.330
Tina, can you hear me?

54:13.050 --> 54:14.650
You ok, baby?

54:15.330 --> 54:17.730
I called for help
and you didn't answer.

54:17.770 --> 54:20.130
- I was right behind you.
- I was attacked.

54:20.170 --> 54:22.210
It was the chains. It was the chains.

54:23.370 --> 54:26.250
I was right here
looking for the fish.

54:26.290 --> 54:28.730
When I turned around,
you were upside down.

54:28.770 --> 54:32.250
- You're hurt!
- Ben, the bodies.

54:32.290 --> 54:35.810
- They disappeared.
- What?

54:35.850 --> 54:37.570
Look!

54:38.850 --> 54:40.210
No.

54:40.970 --> 54:42.930
- No, it can't be.
- They're dead.

54:42.970 --> 54:45.330
- No!
- They're fucking dead.

54:46.730 --> 54:47.810
No!

54:48.490 --> 54:49.610
No.

54:50.890 --> 54:52.450
What are you doing?

54:54.210 --> 54:56.090
Ben, no, no, no.

55:00.650 --> 55:02.090
Oh, my god.

55:12.770 --> 55:14.170
Oh, my god.

55:20.850 --> 55:22.250
Oh, it's them.

55:23.010 --> 55:24.490
It's the owners of the house.

55:28.250 --> 55:30.530
Shit!

55:30.570 --> 55:32.970
Swim! Go! Swim.

55:35.090 --> 55:36.490
Fuck!

55:39.330 --> 55:40.330
Swim!

55:45.850 --> 55:47.730
They're fucking alive!

55:50.850 --> 55:52.010
They can't be.

55:52.050 --> 55:54.410
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

56:09.930 --> 56:11.010
Ben.

56:13.410 --> 56:15.530
Shut the door. Shut the door!

56:33.570 --> 56:36.250
The chimney...
The chimney, it's our only chance.

56:36.290 --> 56:40.650
Ben. Ben, I can't breathe! Ben, i'm...

56:41.210 --> 56:44.210
- I'm suffocating.
- Short, shallow breaths, Tina.

56:46.450 --> 56:48.930
We are getting out.

56:48.970 --> 56:50.890
It's narrow. Take your tank off.

56:50.930 --> 56:55.010
- Ben, I'm not going to make it.
- Breathe.

56:55.050 --> 56:56.770
Breathe like this...

57:00.930 --> 57:02.050
Good, Tina.

57:03.610 --> 57:04.770
Great.

57:06.930 --> 57:08.410
Inhale.

57:10.890 --> 57:12.370
Exhale.

57:14.090 --> 57:15.090
Inhale.

57:17.210 --> 57:21.090
This rope up.
Our way out is at the top there.

57:21.130 --> 57:23.210
I'll send Tom up to give us some light.

57:31.050 --> 57:32.650
We can do this, all right?

57:37.410 --> 57:38.690
Come on.

57:50.770 --> 57:51.970
You good?

57:52.770 --> 57:55.130
- Are you with me?
- Yes.

57:55.170 --> 57:58.170
Almost there, Tina.
We'll make it out, I promise.

58:04.330 --> 58:06.370
Not far now. Hang in there.

58:11.050 --> 58:12.290
Come on.

58:15.850 --> 58:17.130
What the fuck is that?

58:17.970 --> 58:19.490
What the fuck is that?

58:21.490 --> 58:24.050
Oh! Take cover!

58:36.610 --> 58:37.730
Fuck!

59:23.490 --> 59:24.650
Ben.

59:28.930 --> 59:30.210
Ben?

59:31.130 --> 59:34.290
Ben! Ben, I'm stuck in the chimney.

59:35.690 --> 59:37.530
Ben, where are you?

59:40.010 --> 59:41.170
Help.

59:51.810 --> 59:53.090
Ben?

59:53.130 --> 59:55.010
Ben, answer me.

59:57.530 --> 59:59.170
Ben, answer me!

59:59.570 --> 1:00:00.810
Talk to me.

1:00:01.850 --> 1:00:03.330
Talk to me.

1:00:04.130 --> 1:00:05.210
Ben!

1:00:42.290 --> 1:00:45.530
Tina? Tina, are you ok?

1:00:45.570 --> 1:00:46.690
Come on, Tom.

1:00:47.690 --> 1:00:49.850
Work! Work, you fucker!

1:00:54.650 --> 1:00:56.250
Oh, shit.

1:00:56.290 --> 1:00:57.530
Ben, where are you?

1:00:58.650 --> 1:01:00.410
Talk to me.

1:01:00.930 --> 1:01:02.930
Ben, talk to me!

1:01:05.450 --> 1:01:06.970
Tina, where are you?

1:01:08.410 --> 1:01:09.570
Tina!

1:01:11.610 --> 1:01:14.690
Tina, I'm locked in the bedroom.
I'm upstairs.

1:01:24.010 --> 1:01:25.010
Damn it!

1:01:31.090 --> 1:01:32.810
Oh, shit!

1:01:32.850 --> 1:01:34.450
Shit.

1:01:34.490 --> 1:01:35.530
Ben!

1:01:36.490 --> 1:01:37.490
Ben, where are you?

1:01:43.490 --> 1:01:44.890
Ben?

1:01:46.050 --> 1:01:48.050
Ben, answer me!

1:02:11.050 --> 1:02:12.290
Fuck.

1:02:23.850 --> 1:02:26.370
Pierre, you bastard.

1:02:26.410 --> 1:02:28.250
You're the montegnac's son!

1:02:34.370 --> 1:02:37.690
Come on, Tom. Work! Work, you fucker!

1:02:39.130 --> 1:02:40.610
Tina, can you hear me?

1:02:42.650 --> 1:02:44.090
Tina, are you ok?

1:02:49.370 --> 1:02:51.290
Fuck! Tina!

1:02:51.930 --> 1:02:54.650
<i>Ben! Ben, where are you?</i>

1:03:41.130 --> 1:03:42.730
Ben, can you hear me?

1:03:44.250 --> 1:03:45.250
Ben!

1:03:51.370 --> 1:03:52.610
Ben!

1:03:55.810 --> 1:03:57.330
Where are you?

1:04:27.610 --> 1:04:29.250
Ben!

1:04:29.970 --> 1:04:31.650
Ben!

1:04:44.650 --> 1:04:45.730
Ben.

1:05:05.530 --> 1:05:07.170
Ben, are you here?

1:05:09.770 --> 1:05:10.850
Ben!

1:05:21.730 --> 1:05:23.730
Oh, Ben.

1:05:27.290 --> 1:05:28.650
Ben!

1:05:31.330 --> 1:05:32.690
Ben, I'm here.

1:05:34.050 --> 1:05:37.010
I'm here, sweetheart. Are you ok?

1:05:38.610 --> 1:05:40.170
Oh, my god. Are you hurt?

1:05:41.450 --> 1:05:42.770
Oh, your mask!

1:05:44.690 --> 1:05:46.850
- It's leaking. What's going on?
- I'm better.

1:05:47.690 --> 1:05:51.130
- I'm better now.
- Ok. Ok.

1:05:51.170 --> 1:05:53.850
- How much air do you have left?
- I don't know.

1:05:55.730 --> 1:05:58.530
Ok, you have 12 percent.

1:05:59.250 --> 1:06:02.450
- I have eight percent left.
- You'll die before me.

1:06:02.930 --> 1:06:04.050
What?

1:06:05.690 --> 1:06:08.690
- What are you talking about?
- We're out of danger now.

1:06:09.450 --> 1:06:10.450
Ben!

1:06:11.050 --> 1:06:13.850
Snap out of it. You're in shock.

1:06:15.050 --> 1:06:17.130
Ben, we're gonna get out of here.

1:06:17.170 --> 1:06:19.010
For fuck sake, wake up.

1:06:20.130 --> 1:06:21.170
Please.

1:06:22.050 --> 1:06:24.050
Please. I love you, baby.

1:06:31.330 --> 1:06:34.690
Oh, my god.
Something's in my suit. Fuck! Fuck!

1:06:35.370 --> 1:06:38.010
Oh, fuck. Help!

1:06:40.010 --> 1:06:41.130
Do you see anything?

1:06:41.810 --> 1:06:44.530
Oh, my god, it's crawling up my ribs!

1:06:44.570 --> 1:06:45.810
Keep calm, Tina.

1:06:48.130 --> 1:06:50.130
Where is it? Where is it?

1:06:50.170 --> 1:06:52.210
Oh, my god. I can feel it up my neck.

1:06:54.690 --> 1:06:56.490
It's only a snake.

1:06:57.290 --> 1:06:58.410
What? What?

1:07:06.930 --> 1:07:08.330
Look at me, Tina.

1:07:10.370 --> 1:07:13.490
- Open your mouth.
- What?

1:07:14.410 --> 1:07:16.050
Let it in.

1:07:17.690 --> 1:07:19.370
- What?
- Swallow it!

1:07:19.410 --> 1:07:21.050
Let go of me, Ben!

1:07:35.370 --> 1:07:38.010
- Did you see that?
- It's the house.

1:07:39.130 --> 1:07:40.530
She knows...

1:07:40.570 --> 1:07:43.450
- She knows your fears.
- What?

1:07:43.490 --> 1:07:46.650
Soon we'll have nothing to be afraid of.

1:07:46.690 --> 1:07:48.450
Where are you going?

1:07:51.850 --> 1:07:55.490
- The cellar.
- Not the cellar, Ben, no!

1:07:55.530 --> 1:07:59.490
We already explored the basement.
There's nothing down there.

1:07:59.530 --> 1:08:02.530
- You'll see.
- No. No, Ben!

1:08:04.170 --> 1:08:05.690
This is the way.

1:08:07.530 --> 1:08:09.450
The way out?

1:08:12.610 --> 1:08:13.930
Trust me.

1:08:32.850 --> 1:08:34.449
Almost there.

1:08:48.010 --> 1:08:49.930
This is it.

1:08:55.170 --> 1:08:57.050
Oh, my god. Finally.

1:09:00.130 --> 1:09:01.329
What?

1:09:02.610 --> 1:09:04.449
Come in, Tina.

1:09:06.369 --> 1:09:09.890
There's nothing here.
It's a dead end.

1:09:10.369 --> 1:09:12.930
This is where it all begins,
my love.

1:09:15.610 --> 1:09:18.810
- Where is the way out?
- There was never a way out.

1:09:19.449 --> 1:09:21.250
- We're safe here.
- Fuck.

1:09:22.409 --> 1:09:24.529
- Five percent.
- Good, Tina.

1:09:25.610 --> 1:09:27.369
Breathe like me.

1:09:27.970 --> 1:09:29.730
We belong to this place now.

1:09:31.090 --> 1:09:32.210
We've been chosen.

1:09:34.010 --> 1:09:35.290
Ben!

1:09:42.250 --> 1:09:43.650
What the fuck is that?

1:09:44.810 --> 1:09:47.290
Mr montegnac and his son, Pierre.

1:09:48.850 --> 1:09:50.210
Pierre?

1:09:50.250 --> 1:09:52.770
They would kidnap kids
from the neighbouring farms

1:09:52.810 --> 1:09:54.090
and sacrifice them.

1:09:55.970 --> 1:09:59.650
- The fucker set us up!
- It's not a trap, darling.

1:09:59.690 --> 1:10:02.330
It's a gift. A sacrifice.

1:10:03.090 --> 1:10:04.690
Sarah.

1:10:10.370 --> 1:10:12.770
The locals came
to avenge their dead children.

1:10:14.730 --> 1:10:16.850
They killed her in her own bed.

1:10:17.450 --> 1:10:19.050
What the fuck is that?

1:10:22.250 --> 1:10:25.330
But Pierre managed to escape.

1:10:27.130 --> 1:10:29.250
What are you talking about?
I don't care.

1:10:29.290 --> 1:10:31.410
I don't want to die here.

1:10:32.290 --> 1:10:34.010
Masks of shame.

1:10:34.930 --> 1:10:37.090
Intended to punish.

1:10:41.490 --> 1:10:43.850
No!

1:10:47.770 --> 1:10:49.810
Don't be afraid, Tina.

1:10:51.450 --> 1:10:52.890
She will guide us.

1:10:57.450 --> 1:10:59.450
What? What?

1:11:09.210 --> 1:11:10.850
Join us, Tina.

1:11:11.970 --> 1:11:13.170
No, no!

1:11:13.850 --> 1:11:15.330
Join us, Tina.

1:11:21.090 --> 1:11:22.690
Join us, Tina.

1:11:41.130 --> 1:11:42.490
Get off me!

1:11:43.690 --> 1:11:45.050
Ben, get off me!

1:11:46.050 --> 1:11:47.290
Let me go!

1:11:48.650 --> 1:11:50.890
- Ben!
- We cannot stay here.

1:11:52.370 --> 1:11:54.090
I'm going to kill you, my love.

1:11:54.130 --> 1:11:56.010
Don't be afraid.

1:11:56.050 --> 1:11:58.330
Ben, let me go!
I don't want to die here. No!

1:11:59.290 --> 1:12:01.810
Don't worry. I shall die as well.

1:12:03.530 --> 1:12:04.930
Ben, this isn't you!

1:12:08.370 --> 1:12:09.570
Don't fight it, Tina.

1:12:10.250 --> 1:12:13.090
This is our chance
to be part of something.

1:12:13.690 --> 1:12:15.290
Something much bigger than us.

1:12:28.530 --> 1:12:30.810
- Tina?
- Yes?

1:12:31.530 --> 1:12:33.610
- Yes, my love. I'm here.
- What happened?

1:12:36.450 --> 1:12:38.810
We're out of time.
We need to go now.

1:12:38.850 --> 1:12:41.970
Ok. There's a passageway above us.
Maybe it's the way out.

1:12:42.890 --> 1:12:45.410
- Ok.
- Count your breath, baby. Ok?

1:12:49.530 --> 1:12:51.530
No!

1:13:01.090 --> 1:13:02.610
Ben!

1:13:08.570 --> 1:13:10.090
Oh, no.
