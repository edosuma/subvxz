WEBVTT

00:07.759 --> 00:09.636
Pizza delivery!

00:12.138 --> 00:14.140
Pepperoni pizza from Paola's!

00:21.564 --> 00:22.440
What do you want?

00:24.067 --> 00:25.276
You ordered a pizza?

00:26.194 --> 00:27.111
Not me.

00:29.906 --> 00:30.782
Are you sure...?

00:42.752 --> 00:43.628
What?

00:43.878 --> 00:46.214
It's him, it's him.
I need you to give me your phone.

00:48.174 --> 00:49.050
OK.

00:58.726 --> 00:59.602
What, Carly?

00:59.811 --> 01:02.397
I need you to come
to the Wayside Motel right now.

01:02.855 --> 01:03.982
<i>Why? What d'you do?</i>

01:04.274 --> 01:06.192
I found Marius Josipovic.

01:06.234 --> 01:07.860
<i>Jesus Christ, Carly.</i>

01:07.902 --> 01:10.822
Stay where you are, OK?
Don't do anything. I'm on my way.

01:37.307 --> 01:38.182
So, what do we do?

01:39.434 --> 01:40.310
"What do we do?"

01:40.727 --> 01:43.104
We don't do anything.
I'm taking you home. Get in the car.

01:43.271 --> 01:45.440
- No.
- "No"? What do you mean "no"?

01:45.732 --> 01:47.984
How do you even know
that's Josipovic in there?

01:48.026 --> 01:49.736
I saw his picture on his police record.

01:51.654 --> 01:52.530
Carly...

01:53.990 --> 01:57.076
Please tell me that you did not use
my computer to look at his file.

01:59.704 --> 02:01.331
What the fuck, Carly?

02:01.372 --> 02:03.207
D'you know how much trouble
I could be in if somebody finds out?

02:04.959 --> 02:07.545
...out of your fucking mind!
I don't care...

02:15.803 --> 02:17.847
- Pete?
<i>- There's a cop outside.</i>

02:18.514 --> 02:21.434
A cop? A cop could be there for anything.

02:21.476 --> 02:23.353
No, no. Something's up.

02:23.394 --> 02:25.938
They sent a pizza delivery girl
to smoke me out.

02:26.147 --> 02:27.357
There's no way...

02:29.817 --> 02:31.653
Wait a minute, what did she look like?

02:31.694 --> 02:34.072
<i>She's got brown hair, she's kinda cute.</i>

02:34.113 --> 02:36.574
She came to the door
and she looked at me all weird

02:36.616 --> 02:38.534
and then she tried to look inside the room.

02:38.576 --> 02:39.827
Pete, listen to me.

02:40.536 --> 02:41.621
Get out of there now.

02:41.663 --> 02:42.830
Go out the back window.

02:43.289 --> 02:44.165
Hold on.

02:49.629 --> 02:50.505
Fuck!

02:51.756 --> 02:54.384
- It's jammed.
<i>- Well, use the bathroom window.</i>

02:57.553 --> 02:58.554
There is no window.

02:59.138 --> 03:00.682
Alright, listen. Hide under the bed.

03:00.932 --> 03:02.600
Don't answer the door for anybody.

03:02.892 --> 03:03.810
I'm on my way.

03:20.660 --> 03:21.536
Fuck.

03:34.590 --> 03:35.508
Oh, my God!

03:35.550 --> 03:37.677
- You scared the shit out of me!
- What're you doing here?

03:38.845 --> 03:39.846
I thought you left town.

03:42.890 --> 03:46.102
I'm just tying up some loose ends,
and then I'm gone.

03:46.561 --> 03:49.188
Is one of those loose
ends Marius Josipovic?

03:49.230 --> 03:51.190
Carly, get in the fucking car.

03:51.274 --> 03:53.234
How do you know about Marius Josipovic?

03:53.609 --> 03:55.027
I know he's in that hotel room.

03:56.195 --> 03:58.573
Oh, is that why you left this

03:59.157 --> 04:00.783
in the car, so you could follow me?

04:00.825 --> 04:02.493
What the fuck, Carly?

04:02.535 --> 04:04.203
I just wanted to find out the truth.

04:04.829 --> 04:06.456
And I called you, didn't I?

04:07.081 --> 04:10.209
Alright, fine.
Marius Josipovic is in that hotel room.

04:10.293 --> 04:11.961
Wooptie-fucking-doo. You happy?

04:12.462 --> 04:15.381
- And he's not just some drug addict, is he?
- No. No.

04:15.423 --> 04:17.341
He's my old cellmate.

04:18.301 --> 04:19.635
I didn't wanna tell you about it

04:19.677 --> 04:22.013
because... I'm not too proud
about that time in my life.

04:22.305 --> 04:23.181
Right.

04:24.182 --> 04:25.266
Hanging out with ex-cons

04:25.308 --> 04:27.351
that's how you're gonna
turn your life around, Pete?

04:28.311 --> 04:31.230
That's a parole violation.
I should arrest you both right now.

04:31.773 --> 04:33.733
Yeah, especially if your friend
killed Winslow.

04:38.321 --> 04:39.238
Alright, fine.

04:39.572 --> 04:42.742
Arrest your cousin for violating parole,
and arrest Marius for murder

04:42.784 --> 04:44.035
if that's what you think he did.

04:53.211 --> 04:54.086
Come on, Carly.

04:55.546 --> 04:56.714
- Hey, listen I--
- Wait, that's it?

04:56.756 --> 04:57.632
Come on!

04:57.673 --> 05:00.343
I don't know what you're looking for

05:00.384 --> 05:02.136
but my life is just not that interesting.

05:12.855 --> 05:14.357
What the...?

05:15.650 --> 05:16.526
Goddamn it.

05:19.529 --> 05:20.404
Hello?

05:20.446 --> 05:22.532
They just left,
but you can't stay here anymore.

05:22.865 --> 05:24.033
OK. What do I do?

05:24.116 --> 05:26.410
I hid $500 in a bag in the closet.

05:27.036 --> 05:29.705
Wait ten minutes.
Buy a bus ticket to Sedona

05:30.039 --> 05:31.082
and go find your mother.

05:31.457 --> 05:34.210
They know she's there.
I can only hold them for so long

05:34.252 --> 05:35.253
but you gotta get going.

05:35.837 --> 05:37.296
Pete, stay safe.

05:39.841 --> 05:41.300
And go far, far away...

05:41.342 --> 05:42.260
How you doing?

05:45.096 --> 05:46.305
I know where my mother is.

05:46.514 --> 05:48.140
- About fucking time.
- Where?

05:48.391 --> 05:49.600
How much gas do you have?

05:49.851 --> 05:50.935
Three-quarters, why?

05:51.269 --> 05:52.645
That'll get us halfway there.

05:53.354 --> 05:54.564
Head north on 95.

06:29.348 --> 06:31.893

06:34.270 --> 06:37.356

07:00.671 --> 07:02.173
No way that car's still there.

07:03.507 --> 07:05.885
It's stripped or stolen by now.

07:06.260 --> 07:07.887
For your sake, I hope you're wrong.

07:09.221 --> 07:11.515
So you're the asshole
who put Moe in the hospital?

07:11.557 --> 07:13.392
Well, I offered him an easier way

07:14.268 --> 07:15.519
but he picked the hard one.

07:15.895 --> 07:17.980
We find the car, what then?

07:18.314 --> 07:19.315
Car first.

07:20.274 --> 07:21.317
Questions later.

07:22.401 --> 07:23.569
I didn't kill your father.

07:24.278 --> 07:25.154
Who did?

07:25.655 --> 07:26.739
I can't tell you.

07:26.989 --> 07:28.032
I could make you.

07:28.074 --> 07:29.659
With my heart?

07:29.992 --> 07:32.203
You're lucky I'm not stroked out already.

07:34.497 --> 07:38.250
I gotta, I gotta call my wife.
Let her know I'm OK.

07:38.292 --> 07:40.586
- No, I don't think so.
- Hey...

07:41.170 --> 07:44.006
My family, we're bail bond people.

07:44.882 --> 07:46.759
I don't check in, they'll come looking.

07:48.552 --> 07:50.054
I don't want them involved.

07:51.597 --> 07:53.891
Simpler, we just keep this
between me and you.

07:56.727 --> 07:57.770
Don't fuck with me.

08:04.819 --> 08:06.278
Hey, sweetie, it's me.

08:06.821 --> 08:10.074
Uh, Sammy and me, we went to Moe's and...

08:10.700 --> 08:11.993
<i>I shouldn't drive.</i>

08:13.160 --> 08:15.246
Now, I'm gonna crash on his couch

08:15.746 --> 08:18.624
and then, uh...
I just didn't want you to be worried.

08:19.125 --> 08:21.419
This have anything to do
with that bad feeling you had?

08:22.128 --> 08:23.754
Of course I'm being smart.

08:24.714 --> 08:26.173
Don't be so surprised.

08:29.593 --> 08:30.720
I love you too.

08:35.933 --> 08:36.809
OK?

08:37.727 --> 08:39.854
- What if she calls Sammy?
- Oh...

08:41.230 --> 08:42.606
she won't call Sammy.

08:48.029 --> 08:49.280
What do you want, Sam?

08:50.031 --> 08:53.951
Just letting you know
your husband and I tied one on

08:53.993 --> 08:55.786
and he's sawing logs on my couch.

08:58.289 --> 09:01.167
I was just going home from work,
I could swing by and pick him up.

09:01.751 --> 09:05.254
No, there's no need.
May as well let him sleep it off.

09:05.755 --> 09:08.507
Well, at least he's safe.

09:09.341 --> 09:11.844
<i>- Thanks for taking care of him.</i>
- No problem.

09:34.950 --> 09:35.826
Fuck.

09:42.041 --> 09:42.917
Grandma?

09:43.667 --> 09:44.543
Grandpa?

10:13.906 --> 10:14.949
What, no lecture?

10:15.991 --> 10:16.867
What's the point?

10:21.288 --> 10:23.582
How do you know that Marius Josi--

10:23.624 --> 10:25.960
Jesus! Carly, will you stop?

10:26.001 --> 10:27.169
No, no, I won't.

10:27.711 --> 10:29.296
There are too many secrets in this family.

10:29.338 --> 10:31.340
If it's not weird shit with Pete,
it's something else.

10:31.382 --> 10:32.258
Like what?

10:32.925 --> 10:35.636
Like what happened to Mum and Pop.

10:36.637 --> 10:37.805
That's not a secret.

10:38.139 --> 10:40.099
What do you call it when two people die

10:40.141 --> 10:41.725
and nobody ever talks about it?

10:50.693 --> 10:52.653
It almost killed Grandma and Grandpa.

10:53.863 --> 10:56.949
That's why nobody ever talks about it.

10:59.160 --> 11:01.620
Every time I come to the farm

11:03.164 --> 11:04.290
I look at that pond

11:06.125 --> 11:09.587
and I see the old tent
that Pop and I used to camp out in.

11:10.462 --> 11:12.298
And I look in the backyard

11:14.341 --> 11:15.885
and I see Julia and Mum

11:16.302 --> 11:17.386
planting mint

11:18.721 --> 11:20.097
same mint that's there right now.

11:21.098 --> 11:22.224
But you never had that.

11:24.852 --> 11:25.811
Funny thing is...

11:26.812 --> 11:27.730
out of all of us

11:30.858 --> 11:33.736
you were the one that looks just like Mum.

11:37.740 --> 11:38.616
Really?

11:39.617 --> 11:40.492
God...

11:41.410 --> 11:42.745
Sometimes it's spooky.

11:49.084 --> 11:50.794
I just want to know who they were.

11:52.588 --> 11:56.342
Not the fantasy that everyone built
after they died.

11:57.718 --> 11:58.886
Do you remember that day?

12:02.848 --> 12:04.683
- No.
- I picked you up from kindergarten.

12:05.392 --> 12:06.644
I was still in shock.

12:09.063 --> 12:11.315
You were just talking away.

12:12.191 --> 12:13.400
And I didn't know what to do.

12:14.360 --> 12:15.611
I just drove around

12:15.861 --> 12:18.697
like as long as we kept driving,
they weren't really dead.

12:21.742 --> 12:24.161
Cos I knew as soon
as we pulled back into this farm

12:24.620 --> 12:26.205
our lives would never be the same.

12:28.791 --> 12:30.000
Look, Carly.

12:31.752 --> 12:33.921
Life doesn't always go
the way you'd expect.

12:37.466 --> 12:38.759
I'm not in the NHL.

12:40.552 --> 12:42.263
I'm a Bridgeport cop.

12:44.223 --> 12:47.977
It's not what I wanted,
but it's not so bad.

12:48.727 --> 12:49.687
At a certain point

12:49.728 --> 12:52.773
we don't get to blame what happens to us
on our dead parents.

12:56.277 --> 13:00.489
Carly, you are so smart.
You are so fucking smart.

13:00.739 --> 13:02.616
But you gotta decide
what you wanna do with that.

13:04.994 --> 13:07.746
You keep wasting your time stealing,
that leads one way.

13:10.082 --> 13:13.043
You do something rash,
it can't always be undone.

13:16.672 --> 13:17.548
And I understand

13:17.589 --> 13:20.009
I understand wanting to figure out
what happened to Mum and Dad

13:20.217 --> 13:21.093
I did too.

13:22.136 --> 13:24.346
Last year,
I got hold of the police reports.

13:24.388 --> 13:25.264
And?

13:29.393 --> 13:30.686
Didn't solve any mysteries.

13:33.439 --> 13:36.817
Only thing that was weird
was the guy who hit them wasn't loaded

13:37.276 --> 13:38.235
like they told us.

13:42.072 --> 13:43.240
I know this sucks.

13:45.326 --> 13:46.702
And I would change it if I could.

13:50.456 --> 13:52.124
But you should try to remember that...

13:52.875 --> 13:54.335
you're not the only one hurting.

14:00.632 --> 14:04.053
Julia tried to find my mum
after my grandpa had a stroke.

14:04.219 --> 14:05.387
She hired somebody

14:06.347 --> 14:07.598
who tracked her to Sedona.

14:07.639 --> 14:08.974
And then you guys spooked her.

14:09.641 --> 14:12.186
He picked up her trail again to Buffalo,
and then it went cold.

14:12.353 --> 14:14.188
Rosedale's near Buffalo.
That's where she is.

14:14.229 --> 14:15.147
Why is she there?

14:16.106 --> 14:17.858
She'd go where her skills would take her.

14:18.942 --> 14:19.818
What skills?

14:20.736 --> 14:21.653
You don't know?

14:22.780 --> 14:25.866
Cassadaga, New Orleans, Sedona,
it's what they all have in common.

14:25.908 --> 14:27.284
They're all spiritualist centres.

14:28.660 --> 14:29.953
Psychics, new-age healing.

14:30.579 --> 14:32.289
- Your mum's psychic?
- Yep.

14:33.165 --> 14:35.417
- Like, really psychic?
- Yep.

14:36.418 --> 14:39.004
Ask him if she hunts leprechauns
on a fucking unicorn.

14:39.046 --> 14:40.964
There's no such thing as "really" psychic.

14:41.006 --> 14:43.092
- Says who?
- Says fucking science!

14:43.801 --> 14:44.676
Tell him it's a con.

14:44.718 --> 14:46.804
She always knew
what I was gonna do before I did it.

14:46.845 --> 14:47.763
Get the fuck outta here, man.

14:48.722 --> 14:50.682
She knew you guys were coming,
didn't she?

14:50.724 --> 14:51.892
Hey, he's right about that.

14:52.893 --> 14:53.936
Unbelievable.

15:09.785 --> 15:10.661
Where was it?

15:12.329 --> 15:13.247
It was right here.

15:21.380 --> 15:22.881
Jesus, do you have to do that?

15:25.259 --> 15:26.135
Shh.

15:26.427 --> 15:28.429
You see a nice Caddy parked over here
the other day?

15:29.012 --> 15:30.556
Yeah? You see what happened to it?

15:34.643 --> 15:35.519
Cowboy...

15:36.854 --> 15:37.813
in a black hat.

15:37.855 --> 15:39.648
Huh, what the fuck does that mean, huh?

15:40.566 --> 15:41.900
Pig... pigtails.

15:42.526 --> 15:44.862
- An Indian maybe.
- Don't fuck with me, hobo.

15:44.903 --> 15:47.739
Whoa, whoa. Hold it, hold it,
I think I know what he means.

15:48.740 --> 15:50.284
- Good.
- No...

15:50.951 --> 15:51.827
it's not good.

15:52.536 --> 15:54.872
You want my advice,
you'll forget about the damn car.

15:54.913 --> 15:56.540
What makes you think I want your advice?

15:57.166 --> 15:58.459
Come on, get in the car.
Let's go.

16:05.048 --> 16:05.924
Pete.

16:07.634 --> 16:08.802
Rosedale website.

16:10.471 --> 16:11.346
OK?

16:11.388 --> 16:14.224
List of all registered mediums.

16:26.361 --> 16:27.237
Well, Pete?

16:33.911 --> 16:35.662
- She's not there.
- Who's not where?

16:36.413 --> 16:38.665
Pete's mum is not on the Rosedale website.

16:39.416 --> 16:41.585
You could have fucking told us
before we drove all night.

16:41.627 --> 16:43.295
Well, she's hiding, right?

16:43.504 --> 16:46.507
She's probably not gonna let her picture...
on a website.

16:46.757 --> 16:48.509
Don't worry about it.
It's not gonna be a problem.

16:48.550 --> 16:50.052
I'll get there, I'll find her,
and I'll call you.

16:50.093 --> 16:52.429
- The fuck you will, man.
- Yeah, we'll go with you, Pete.

16:53.263 --> 16:54.765
Well, she's seen you already.

16:54.806 --> 16:57.017
If she sees you again,
she'll probably run again.

16:57.267 --> 16:58.268
Got a good point there.

16:59.686 --> 17:00.604
Except for one thing...

17:01.522 --> 17:02.940
she only seen Frank.

17:53.949 --> 17:55.158
Carjacking Jews.

17:55.492 --> 17:56.410
Who knew?

18:01.290 --> 18:02.165
Hey, hey!

18:03.417 --> 18:06.670
Hold it. They got 20 armed guards.
We got one gun and an old gimp.

18:07.337 --> 18:08.797
You sure you wanna go in hard?

18:09.131 --> 18:11.717
What, you think we should wait
for the Sabbath?

18:12.050 --> 18:13.802
How about waiting for the shot-caller?

18:38.076 --> 18:40.704
Jesus, could this day get any worse?

18:41.538 --> 18:42.789
Can I help you?

18:43.290 --> 18:45.000
Yeah, you can send someone else over.

18:45.375 --> 18:48.045
I-I'm the only here right now.

18:49.963 --> 18:50.839
Fine.

18:51.715 --> 18:54.343
Can you tell me which courtroom
Lance is in today?

18:54.885 --> 18:55.761
He's not.

18:56.094 --> 18:58.305
He cleared his cases for a couple weeks

18:58.347 --> 19:00.057
turned 'em all over to Mr Johnson.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.184
That's just great.

19:02.559 --> 19:03.977
So you have no idea where he is?

19:04.686 --> 19:07.356
I-I thought he was taking
a vacation with you.

19:07.397 --> 19:08.649
Clearly not.

19:10.067 --> 19:10.942
Ha...

19:13.028 --> 19:15.072
You're sure he didn't say anything else?

19:15.697 --> 19:17.157
That's all I know.

19:17.491 --> 19:19.284
But, you know, we barely speak

19:19.326 --> 19:20.202
since...

19:20.702 --> 19:21.787
well, you know, uh...

19:22.329 --> 19:23.205
Yes, Trish.

19:23.747 --> 19:24.623
I do know.

19:26.541 --> 19:27.584
I'm sorry.

19:28.835 --> 19:29.711
What?

19:29.753 --> 19:33.757
I never would've hooked up with Lance
if I'd known he was seeing you again.

19:34.216 --> 19:35.300
Honest.

19:35.967 --> 19:36.843
Um...

19:37.469 --> 19:38.428
I appreciate that.

19:39.346 --> 19:40.722
It just doesn't change anything.

19:41.556 --> 19:42.432
I know...

19:42.808 --> 19:44.267
but I wanted it out there.

19:45.477 --> 19:48.355
Do you mind if I ask
what he's done this time?

19:49.314 --> 19:50.190
Long story.

19:50.691 --> 19:51.858
Well, I have time.

19:52.693 --> 19:53.652
At lunch.

19:53.902 --> 19:56.905
And I would have lunch with you why, now?

19:57.698 --> 19:59.491
I dunno, person's gotta eat.

20:00.575 --> 20:04.538
And in the meantime, I'll ask around
and see if anyone knows where he is.

20:11.211 --> 20:13.880
These people are all here to see
psychics and fortune tellers?

20:13.922 --> 20:15.674
Mediums. Rosedale's just mediums.

20:16.007 --> 20:18.093
Ah, those are the ones
that talk to the dead?

20:18.218 --> 20:20.679
Well, people have been coming here
since the Civil War.

20:20.721 --> 20:22.389
Twenty or 30,000 people a year.

20:22.597 --> 20:24.391
Yeah, people are fucking stupid.

20:24.433 --> 20:26.101
Well, if they didn't get
what they were looking for

20:26.143 --> 20:28.562
this place would've vanished a long time ago,
don't you think?

20:28.729 --> 20:30.772
What're they looking for,
their granddad's silver?

20:31.440 --> 20:32.691
Uh, I don't know.

20:32.733 --> 20:35.235
They just want to be reassured
that death isn't the end.

20:35.277 --> 20:36.778
- I don't know.
- It better fucking be.

20:36.820 --> 20:38.155
Hey, let me ask you something.

20:38.905 --> 20:39.865
You're a smart guy.

20:40.490 --> 20:42.993
Why don't you go after $11 million
for somebody else?

20:44.828 --> 20:45.704
I get paid.

20:45.746 --> 20:47.497
A percentage, but you do all the work.

20:49.040 --> 20:51.376
It's funny, I feel like maybe
I'm getting psychic here.

20:51.835 --> 20:53.920
I got a feeling you're gonna ask me
to throw in with you

20:53.962 --> 20:55.380
and fuck over my partner and boss.

20:55.756 --> 20:57.048
No, no, no, I'm just saying

20:57.090 --> 21:00.177
that $11 million split between
me and my mother

21:00.218 --> 21:03.054
is a hell of a lot more than a percentage.
That had to have occurred to you, right?

21:03.096 --> 21:05.182
Oh, yeah, 11 million,
you think of every angle.

21:05.223 --> 21:07.851
The thing is, I like my partner,
and I fucking hate you

21:08.268 --> 21:10.562
so start knocking on doors,
cos we're running out of time.

21:10.604 --> 21:12.355
You don't just knock on doors
in a place like this.

21:12.397 --> 21:13.398
They protect their own.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.734
From who?
The Wicked Witch of the North?

21:15.776 --> 21:16.693
From us.

21:16.735 --> 21:19.821
They get a whiff that something's off,
they're gonna shut us out completely.

21:20.280 --> 21:21.990
And it's the Wicked Witch of the West.

21:25.786 --> 21:28.121
What, are you gonna knife me
in the fucking street?

21:31.291 --> 21:32.417
How you doing?

21:34.669 --> 21:36.296
- Brothers who are mediums.
- Yeah.

21:36.338 --> 21:37.631
You don't see that every day.

21:38.048 --> 21:39.883
It's funny, you guys don't look much alike.

21:40.717 --> 21:45.055
Oh, well, Pete was a preemie,
sort of the runt of the litter.

21:45.096 --> 21:47.933
Alright, well, at least I didn't
tip the scales at 16 pounds

21:47.974 --> 21:49.726
with a head like a watermelon.

21:52.145 --> 21:53.605
OK, there it is.

21:53.647 --> 21:55.482
- You're definitely brothers.
- Yeah.

21:55.524 --> 21:57.025
- So what can I help you with today?
- Well...

21:57.067 --> 21:59.861
Delores, we were thinking about
leaving Cassadaga.

21:59.903 --> 22:02.072
Mm, wonderful spiritualist community.

22:02.239 --> 22:04.449
I have many friends there.
Maybe you know some of them.

22:04.491 --> 22:07.327
I'm sure we do.
But we wanted to learn about Rosedale

22:07.369 --> 22:10.247
because anybody who's serious
about their calling wants to be here

22:10.288 --> 22:11.665
where the movement began, right?

22:11.706 --> 22:12.999
It's a very special place.

22:13.041 --> 22:13.917
- Yeah.
- Yes.

22:14.292 --> 22:15.961
How do we go about setting up shop?

22:16.503 --> 22:17.420
It's not easy.

22:17.587 --> 22:19.548
There's a very strict vetting process.

22:19.589 --> 22:22.342
- Sure.
- Background checks, references, tests.

22:22.801 --> 22:24.010
I mean, as you can imagine

22:24.052 --> 22:26.638
this business attracts its share
of opportunists and fakes.

22:26.680 --> 22:27.764
Of course, of course.

22:28.139 --> 22:29.516
Let anyone in recently?

22:29.808 --> 22:30.684
We did.

22:30.725 --> 22:32.269
We're actually at full capacity now.

22:33.019 --> 22:34.229
Anyone we might know or...?

22:34.479 --> 22:37.065
Raj Vickery, a mystic from Kolkata.

22:37.607 --> 22:39.818
Uh, Ronald Seers, the healer.

22:39.860 --> 22:41.570
I'm sure I don't have
to tell you guys about him.

22:41.611 --> 22:44.531
I actually took his seminar
on magnetic healing.

22:45.490 --> 22:47.659
- Delores, life altering.
- Yes.

22:48.368 --> 22:49.244
Yes.

22:49.744 --> 22:50.620
Mm.

22:50.787 --> 22:51.663
Anyone else?

22:52.455 --> 22:54.666
Gladys Norman, a convulsive medium.

22:54.708 --> 22:56.710
- Wonderful woman.
- Gladys Norman...

22:57.085 --> 22:58.211
Uh, how old is she?

22:58.461 --> 22:59.337
What's she look like?

23:02.799 --> 23:04.509
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.

23:05.176 --> 23:06.469
Oh, I'm Joe.

23:07.596 --> 23:08.471
Joe.

23:08.513 --> 23:10.140
And what kind of medium are you, Joe?

23:11.182 --> 23:12.767
I'm a clairvoyant, Delores.

23:12.809 --> 23:14.185
Clairaudient or clairsentient?

23:15.645 --> 23:19.274
He's actually all three: clairvoyant,
clairaudient, and clairsentient.

23:20.108 --> 23:21.776
Really? Hm.

23:24.571 --> 23:28.033
We're gonna take a flyer and, uh,
poke around a little bit

23:28.074 --> 23:29.743
but we'll be back later. Come on.

23:33.413 --> 23:35.332
Holy Christ, you suck at this.

23:35.373 --> 23:36.625
You don't say you're something

23:36.666 --> 23:38.460
unless you know what the fuck
you're talking about.

23:39.836 --> 23:41.212
- Gentlemen...
- Yeah?

23:41.838 --> 23:43.715
The Rosedale Board
would like a word with you.

23:46.468 --> 23:47.844
Can you give us a moment, please?

23:48.929 --> 23:49.971
- Sure.
- Thank you.

23:50.221 --> 23:51.097
Thank you.

23:53.975 --> 23:55.644
I gotta do this alone,
otherwise we're blown.

23:56.019 --> 23:58.647
- There's no way I'm letting you outta my s--
- Then we don't find my mother.

24:01.733 --> 24:02.734
Fine, go ahead.

24:02.776 --> 24:03.652
Thank you.

24:03.818 --> 24:05.737
- Thank you.
- Don't be fucking cute.

24:08.156 --> 24:09.032
Hi.

24:13.244 --> 24:15.288
Well, the rain sure isn't doing us
any favours.

24:16.373 --> 24:19.459
Fairfield knew the rain was coming,
bagged the evidence fast.

24:20.001 --> 24:22.337
Unlikely we're gonna find anything
they didn't.

24:24.214 --> 24:25.090
Mm...

24:25.131 --> 24:27.050
Nothing like the smell of the woods
in the rain.

24:28.093 --> 24:31.638
The smell of white pine during a good storm
is one of the best parts of living here.

24:33.056 --> 24:34.724
Actinomycetes.

24:35.517 --> 24:36.393
Beg your pardon?

24:36.434 --> 24:37.477
Bacteria.

24:37.560 --> 24:39.854
Responsible for the decomp
of organic material.

24:39.896 --> 24:41.856
Spores scatter after the rain.

24:41.898 --> 24:44.359
- That's... that's the good smell.
- Oh.

24:45.568 --> 24:48.446
Yeah, if it's all the same to you,
I'd prefer to think it's the trees.

24:51.199 --> 24:53.034
I'm not a city girl, Officer Bowman.

24:53.910 --> 24:56.162
Grew up in a small town,
population 2,000.

24:56.997 --> 24:57.872
Really?

24:58.373 --> 24:59.249
Where?

24:59.499 --> 25:00.917
Sanbornton, New Hampshire.

25:01.459 --> 25:02.335
You're kidding.

25:04.129 --> 25:06.172
Me and my grandpa and my buddies, we...

25:06.214 --> 25:08.550
we go to Hermit Lake
every summer for a week.

25:09.759 --> 25:11.386
I used to go there with my dad

25:12.846 --> 25:14.014
before he passed.

25:15.098 --> 25:15.974
I'm sorry.

25:16.433 --> 25:17.600
No, it was a few years ago.

25:18.393 --> 25:21.104
Now, uh, I go with my brother
and his family about once a year.

25:23.398 --> 25:25.608
Out on the lake,
it still feels like my dad's there.

25:25.650 --> 25:26.526
It's...

25:28.653 --> 25:30.488
Who knows? Maybe our paths crossed.

25:30.989 --> 25:32.032
Jesus, I hope not.

25:32.574 --> 25:34.284
My buddies are a bunch of drunken idiots.

25:42.876 --> 25:43.793
What?

25:44.961 --> 25:47.839
If this is where the killer caught up
to Winslow and rammed him

25:48.631 --> 25:50.175
why are there only one set of tracks?

25:50.216 --> 25:52.510
There could've been others.
Maybe the rain washed them away.

25:53.261 --> 25:54.929
No, something big hit that Impala.

25:54.971 --> 25:56.181
Tracks should still be here.

25:57.432 --> 25:59.851
I thought the way we talked it out
at the station made sense.

25:59.893 --> 26:02.937
It made sense there, but now we're here,
and it doesn't.

26:05.523 --> 26:06.608
Let's see where they lead.

26:11.988 --> 26:14.449
<i>Hi, you've reached Taylor's phone.
Leave a message.</i>

26:14.491 --> 26:16.409
Uh, Taylor, it's me.

26:17.660 --> 26:19.662
I got a bigger problem than the headlights.

26:19.704 --> 26:23.291
I found paint from Winslow's car
deep inside my grill.

26:24.209 --> 26:25.835
I'm not sure I can get it all off.

26:26.878 --> 26:27.879
What you doing, Grandma?

26:28.963 --> 26:31.091
Oh, hey. Hey.

26:31.591 --> 26:34.135
I, uh, drove out to Easton
to check on a client.

26:34.677 --> 26:36.304
Rabbit jumped out in front of me, I...

26:37.138 --> 26:38.556
I'm cleaning the poor thing off.

26:38.932 --> 26:41.267
- Do you need help?
- No, no, honey, I got this.

26:44.187 --> 26:45.605
You can keep me company, though.

26:53.196 --> 26:54.948
You know, with everything
that's been going on

26:54.989 --> 26:56.407
I haven't even asked how you are.

26:57.534 --> 26:58.409
OK, I guess.

27:00.495 --> 27:03.748
Must've been terrible,
holding a gun on that crooked cop.

27:05.416 --> 27:07.210
You should never have been put
in that position.

27:09.462 --> 27:11.339
At least Taylor got there pretty fast.

27:12.006 --> 27:13.216
Thank God for that.

27:15.760 --> 27:17.303
He was really mad.

27:17.345 --> 27:19.180
Who? The cop?

27:20.140 --> 27:21.057
Taylor.

27:27.230 --> 27:30.024
- Honey, you don't think--
- No, I know, it's stupid.

27:30.066 --> 27:33.570
- It's...
- No, no, Carly, don't worry.

27:34.571 --> 27:35.697
I know your brother.

27:38.158 --> 27:41.619
There's no way he had anything to do
with that man's death.

27:45.623 --> 27:48.459
We don't tolerate charlatans
in Rosedale, sir.

27:49.627 --> 27:53.047
People who live and work here are sincere
in their commitment to spiritualism.

27:53.089 --> 27:55.091
I want to apologise for my brother.

27:55.133 --> 27:58.720
We, uh, come from a long line
of mediums on my mother's side

27:59.095 --> 28:00.513
and, uh, uh...

28:01.389 --> 28:05.435
sometimes I think that
the gift unnerves him

28:06.561 --> 28:07.812
more than it comforts him.

28:09.606 --> 28:10.648
But I'm different.

28:12.609 --> 28:14.027
Becoming a part of this community

28:14.652 --> 28:16.571
has been a dream of mine for a long time

28:17.488 --> 28:19.365
and I would like the opportunity

28:20.491 --> 28:21.534
to prove that to you.

28:22.243 --> 28:24.954
Would you? Honey, wheel me closer.

28:26.539 --> 28:28.041
This is Reverend Ethel Landry

28:28.666 --> 28:31.127
- one of the supreme who...
- I know who Reverend Ethel is.

28:31.669 --> 28:32.837
Every medium does.

28:34.464 --> 28:35.340
It's an honour.

28:36.341 --> 28:38.051
Then why don't you give me a reading?

28:41.095 --> 28:42.013
- Now?
- Yes.

28:42.764 --> 28:44.933
- Do you need to prepare in any way?
- No, ma'am.

28:47.310 --> 28:50.605
Do you have an affinity
in the field of psychometry?

28:50.647 --> 28:51.940
I'd like to think I do.

28:53.483 --> 28:55.735
Tell me the significance of this ring.

28:58.988 --> 28:59.906
May I hold it?

29:14.796 --> 29:17.048
I'm not sure anyone's reaching out.

29:17.423 --> 29:19.926
Let me try and get help
from my spirit guide.

29:34.232 --> 29:38.319
I, I don't, uh... understand, but, uh...

29:38.987 --> 29:40.571
Spirit is telling me that...

29:41.698 --> 29:43.408
this ring has no significance.

29:47.328 --> 29:48.204
Am I right?

29:57.922 --> 30:00.883
May I read from that pendant right there?

30:18.609 --> 30:22.322
There's a very strong energy
coming from this necklace.

30:28.077 --> 30:30.496
The spirit is telling me
that it belonged to a person

30:31.247 --> 30:34.250
of great strength and independence

30:35.585 --> 30:36.753
someone who endured

30:37.920 --> 30:39.881
many hardships in their life.

30:39.922 --> 30:41.883
They were, uh, very significant to you.

30:48.348 --> 30:52.268
You own many, many pieces of jewellery,
but nothing means more than this one.

30:54.604 --> 30:55.563
Sorry.

30:57.523 --> 30:59.859
This necklace belonged to my grandmother.

31:00.818 --> 31:02.153
She also was a healer.

31:02.987 --> 31:05.239
When she fled the Ukraine during the war

31:05.281 --> 31:07.492
this was the only thing of value
she could take.

31:07.742 --> 31:08.618
I know.

31:08.910 --> 31:11.621
And this ring was from a thrift store.

31:14.165 --> 31:18.294
Your spirit guide is perceptive.

31:19.253 --> 31:20.129
Thank you.

31:20.838 --> 31:21.714
Thank you.

31:21.839 --> 31:23.674
- I, I hope this means--
- Or...

31:25.718 --> 31:28.388
Maybe you noticed
that the necklace was an antique

31:29.931 --> 31:32.308
guessed that it was handed down
from a relative.

31:32.725 --> 31:36.270
The stone is jasper, the healing stone.

31:36.312 --> 31:39.857
An observant person might deduce that...

31:40.775 --> 31:43.319
it was from a fellow spiritualist.

31:45.279 --> 31:46.614
I can assure you that...

31:47.573 --> 31:49.075
I only came here to learn.

31:51.577 --> 31:53.287
We'll meet with you again tomorrow

31:53.704 --> 31:54.580
and until then

31:55.706 --> 31:57.625
feel welcome to explore our town.

31:57.959 --> 31:58.835
Thank you.

31:59.544 --> 32:00.420
Thank you.

32:01.838 --> 32:06.342
Oh, you know, I've, I've wanted to tell you
how sorry I am for a while now.

32:06.801 --> 32:07.969
You may not believe it

32:08.010 --> 32:12.140
but it's the first and last time
I've ever done anything like that.

32:13.474 --> 32:17.353
Can I just ask you why? I mean, why him?

32:19.313 --> 32:23.192
Honestly, I think it's when he came
into the office with the kids.

32:23.818 --> 32:26.988
He was so good with them.
It, it changed my opinion of him.

32:27.947 --> 32:29.407
He is good with the kids.

32:29.824 --> 32:32.326
And he has the gift of gab.

32:32.368 --> 32:33.369
Oof, that too.

32:33.661 --> 32:35.705
He actually pulled the wool
over Audrey's eyes

32:35.746 --> 32:36.873
which is not easy.

32:36.914 --> 32:39.584
Do you know she came to visit me
after everything blew up?

32:40.209 --> 32:42.628
Really?
She never said anything.

32:42.795 --> 32:44.046
She gave me hell.

32:44.172 --> 32:47.300
She said if I ever did it again,
she'd kick my ass so hard

32:47.341 --> 32:49.635
I'd be wearing it for a hat.

32:51.471 --> 32:52.346
Wow.

32:52.680 --> 32:54.223
The woman is full of surprises.

32:55.641 --> 32:57.643
Oh, you know, I need to get back.

32:58.019 --> 32:59.353
Could I please get the cheque?

32:59.395 --> 33:01.898
I forgot to even ask you
if you heard anything about Lance.

33:01.939 --> 33:05.109
Oh, my God, yes!
Um, Sandy said he called the office.

33:05.151 --> 33:07.153
He's visiting his mother in Florida.

33:09.405 --> 33:10.281
Florida.

33:10.323 --> 33:11.365
Mm-hmm.

33:13.326 --> 33:14.202
Huh.

33:15.953 --> 33:16.996
Well, thanks.

33:17.038 --> 33:18.414
No problem.

33:18.456 --> 33:20.249
If I hear anything else, I'll let you know.

33:20.625 --> 33:22.710
- Oh.
- Oh, no, let me get the tab.

33:22.752 --> 33:23.669
No, no, I got it.

33:23.711 --> 33:24.587
Are you sure?

33:25.421 --> 33:26.297
I'm sure.

33:28.591 --> 33:30.134
So, there's two sets of tracks.

33:31.344 --> 33:32.678
This could be where he got hit.

33:34.305 --> 33:37.350
Or... I mean, you're from a small town.

33:37.391 --> 33:38.559
You ever go on a field run?

33:39.936 --> 33:42.271
Bunch of us would grab a sixer,
get in the Jeep

33:42.313 --> 33:44.315
go out and cut doughnuts,
tear up a field.

33:44.690 --> 33:47.318
A couple of times we got chased off
by a farmer with a shotgun.

33:48.152 --> 33:49.779
You think this is kids joyriding?

33:50.780 --> 33:52.323
I'm just saying it's a possibility.

33:55.159 --> 33:56.035
Hey, there.

33:56.619 --> 33:57.620
Afternoon.

33:57.954 --> 33:58.955
Good afternoon.

33:58.996 --> 34:00.831
I'm Detective Roby, this is Officer Bowman.

34:01.123 --> 34:02.875
- This your property?
- Yes, ma'am.

34:04.252 --> 34:06.671
You here about that dead policeman?

34:07.421 --> 34:08.297
We are.

34:08.756 --> 34:10.716
Well, you're in the wrong place.

34:11.717 --> 34:15.054
He died about half a mile back that way.

34:15.429 --> 34:17.098
We know.
We're just canvassing the area.

34:18.391 --> 34:22.186
Have you seen or heard
anything unusual the past few days?

34:22.562 --> 34:24.855
Always something going on back here

34:25.690 --> 34:26.566
poachers...

34:27.024 --> 34:28.859
people cutting down my trees

34:29.527 --> 34:32.655
kids running their damn trucks
all over my land.

34:34.448 --> 34:37.743
Alright, well, if you think of anything,
give me a call.

34:41.998 --> 34:43.291
There was a lady...

34:44.500 --> 34:46.085
out here yesterday.

34:46.794 --> 34:49.088
Said she lost her earring on a hike.

34:50.423 --> 34:52.466
Didn't look like a hiker to me, though.

34:53.217 --> 34:54.302
What did she look like?

34:55.136 --> 34:57.013
What you'd call a mature woman.

34:58.514 --> 35:01.934
Had a nasty cut right here.

35:04.103 --> 35:05.062
You take care.

35:05.896 --> 35:08.232
You think that's anything?

35:08.983 --> 35:09.859
I don't know.

35:17.867 --> 35:18.743
What is it?

35:27.001 --> 35:28.127
A detective's shield.

35:30.004 --> 35:31.631
Looks like we're in the middle
of a crime scene.

36:21.931 --> 36:23.140
Oh, my gosh.

36:23.724 --> 36:25.142
Are you OK?

36:25.184 --> 36:26.060
Can I do anything?

36:26.102 --> 36:27.311
Oh...

36:27.353 --> 36:28.229
Oh, yeah.

36:29.188 --> 36:30.064
Yes, please.

36:30.481 --> 36:32.066
Would you call the police for me?

36:32.108 --> 36:33.234
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

36:33.275 --> 36:35.069
I-I'm just a little shaken.

36:35.236 --> 36:36.696
My, my grand...

36:38.698 --> 36:41.742
My grandson's a police officer,
and he says...

36:43.119 --> 36:45.830
He says every accident
needs to be reported.

36:45.871 --> 36:46.747
Of course.

36:46.789 --> 36:47.665
Hang on.

36:48.708 --> 36:51.711
Hello, police?
Yes, I'd like to report an accident.

36:53.587 --> 36:55.131
You hired my father to kill you.

36:57.967 --> 37:00.302
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

37:02.304 --> 37:04.181
Growing up, I thought he was Blackwater.

37:05.391 --> 37:07.226
When I was a little kid,
I thought he was cool.

37:08.686 --> 37:11.063
Teenager, I thought
it was a bunch of hoorah bullshit.

37:11.897 --> 37:13.482
Then I found out what he really did

37:14.775 --> 37:16.569
and I was like, "Oh, shit."

37:22.867 --> 37:25.661
Did not imagine he'd lose it
on a fucking insurance job.

37:42.261 --> 37:43.429
Just wanna see the rabbi.

37:45.806 --> 37:47.099
What can I do for you, Otto?

37:47.266 --> 37:49.435
Oh, <i>shalom aleichem,</i> Rabbi Botvinik.

37:49.852 --> 37:51.937
<i>- Aleichem shalom,</i> Otto.
- How's Baruch?

37:52.354 --> 37:56.400
Oh. I thank you for posting the bond
and keeping our names out of it.

37:56.650 --> 37:58.027
Well, I'm glad we could help.

37:58.694 --> 38:00.946
Though I assume,
since you are broaching the subject

38:00.988 --> 38:02.990
you are here to ask a favour of me.

38:03.032 --> 38:04.408
Ah, I would.

38:04.784 --> 38:05.868
- Just a small one.
- Hmm.

38:05.910 --> 38:06.786
Um...

38:07.411 --> 38:11.457
His father's car was stolen,
Caddy, east side of Bridgeport.

38:11.874 --> 38:13.542
Good reason to believe it came here.

38:14.001 --> 38:15.002
And what reason is this?

38:15.044 --> 38:16.837
A witness saw one of your guys.

38:17.671 --> 38:20.132
His dad just died.

38:20.633 --> 38:23.302
The only thing he has
of his old man's is the car.

38:23.844 --> 38:24.970
He just wants it back.

38:27.306 --> 38:29.183
My son, you have my sympathy

38:29.809 --> 38:32.937
but if the car is here, I own it,
fair and square.

38:32.978 --> 38:34.021
Sorry, what?

38:34.063 --> 38:36.398
Colin, I said let me handle it!

38:36.440 --> 38:39.527
Just ask yourself, can they put a bullet
in me before I put one in you?

38:40.027 --> 38:41.487
Look, everybody calm down.

38:42.279 --> 38:43.531
Seems to me you got a choice.

38:44.198 --> 38:46.116
Everything goes to shit, people die

38:46.700 --> 38:49.203
or you can give this little prick his car
and we're gone.

39:12.893 --> 39:13.811
Where's the jacket?

39:13.853 --> 39:14.854
There was no jacket.

39:14.895 --> 39:17.523
My father's jacket was in the car.
Where the fuck is it?

39:17.857 --> 39:20.276
- Did you see a jacket?
- The car was like that when it came here.

39:20.484 --> 39:22.027
- From where?
- Tow truck driver.

39:22.528 --> 39:24.321
Bill Power, shop near Stamford.

39:27.867 --> 39:31.370
So, we, uh, we understand
you just moved here, Mr Vickery?

39:31.412 --> 39:32.872
Uh, please, just Raj.

39:32.913 --> 39:34.915
- Sorry.
- Yes, three months ago.

39:35.708 --> 39:38.544
It's a very great honour,
as they admit so few.

39:38.586 --> 39:39.628
Who else got in with you?

39:40.045 --> 39:42.298
My esteemed colleague Ronald Seers

39:43.299 --> 39:46.510
but he was already quite famous,
so that was a no-brainer.

39:46.552 --> 39:47.761
Sure. Yeah.

39:48.137 --> 39:49.430
And then there was Gladys

39:50.347 --> 39:51.223
and, well...

39:51.640 --> 39:53.809
you know, everyone likes Gladys, so...

39:54.226 --> 39:55.144
You like her, huh?

39:55.185 --> 39:57.313
Mm. Very much, yeah.

39:58.439 --> 39:59.565
She's hot, huh?

39:59.607 --> 40:03.819
Yes, she's attractive,
but I'm not sure how this is relevant.

40:03.861 --> 40:07.239
We're, we're just trying to talk
to recent arrivals, like you and Gladys

40:07.281 --> 40:08.699
just to get a feel for the place.

40:09.158 --> 40:10.951
Then I'm afraid Gladys can't help you.

40:11.535 --> 40:14.163
She went back to California
almost a month ago.

40:14.496 --> 40:16.624
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Are you fucking kidding me?

40:16.665 --> 40:18.000
Your mother's been gone a month?

40:18.042 --> 40:19.293
We don't know that yet!

40:19.335 --> 40:20.836
Then where the fuck is she?

40:21.420 --> 40:22.838
We're gonna find out, I dunno.

40:23.213 --> 40:24.715
You fucking gambled, and you lost.

40:24.757 --> 40:26.759
- We're done here.
- I'm gonna find her!

40:26.800 --> 40:28.427
- OK. We, we don't, we don't know--
- Listen, listen.

40:28.469 --> 40:29.929
You know what? Fuck all this.

40:30.220 --> 40:32.806
I'm gonna take you to the storage,
and I'll give you to Luka

40:33.390 --> 40:36.060
and whatever the fuck he does with you,
that's up to him.

40:36.101 --> 40:37.061
Get to walking.

40:44.443 --> 40:46.278
- Hey, moron!
- Fucking go!

41:00.751 --> 41:03.921
Does anyone here
feel a connection to a Christopher?

41:04.505 --> 41:07.758
Or maybe a Rose?

41:08.008 --> 41:10.594
Rose... and Bernie?

41:14.014 --> 41:15.432
- Yes!
- Yes?

41:16.266 --> 41:18.060
Rose and Bernie were
my grandparents.

41:18.102 --> 41:19.103
Yes, come.

41:19.144 --> 41:23.399
I, I, I'm... I'm seeing
an elderly man and woman

41:23.440 --> 41:25.901
but they're not together.

41:25.943 --> 41:27.486
That, that's right. That's right.

41:27.528 --> 41:30.990
My, my grandpa cheated
on my grandmother for years

41:31.031 --> 41:33.033
and then just before he passed

41:33.492 --> 41:35.744
he ran off with a French-Canadian woman.

41:35.786 --> 41:41.875
Your grandfather is saying that you were
surprised to learn of his death.

41:41.917 --> 41:42.918
Well, we all were.

41:43.085 --> 41:44.962
- We all were.
- Yes, and I don't know why

41:45.004 --> 41:48.841
but he's bringing your mother in, too.

41:48.882 --> 41:51.301
She was... she was, uh, she was destroyed.

41:51.343 --> 41:53.137
- She was...
- Yes, well, he wants you to know

41:53.929 --> 41:54.805
it's alright.

41:55.347 --> 41:57.725
He knows you would've been there
if you could.

42:01.061 --> 42:03.564
Well, this is the first time
I feel like I've ever had closure.

42:07.234 --> 42:08.110
Group hug!

42:37.681 --> 42:39.266
- I saw what you did.
- You did?

42:39.308 --> 42:40.392
And it was amazing.

42:41.226 --> 42:43.312
I mean, Evan was really struggling
up there and...

42:43.979 --> 42:46.899
- you were so open to his spirit guide.
- Oh, well, thank you.

42:47.649 --> 42:50.569
If you're really serious about moving here,
we can offer you a temp job.

42:50.903 --> 42:54.198
A lot of the new mediums break in
working as assistants to the older ones.

42:54.239 --> 42:56.575
Yeah, I, well... I'll consider it.
Thank you. Thank you.

42:59.078 --> 43:02.372
- Uh, did you just say "assistants"?
- Yeah.

43:15.719 --> 43:16.637
Can I help you?

43:16.678 --> 43:18.514
Hi. Yeah, I, I would like to get a reading.

43:19.556 --> 43:21.767
It's after hours.
You'll have to come back tomorrow.

43:22.601 --> 43:24.019
With all due respect, Reverend

43:24.061 --> 43:25.938
I'd like to get a reading
from your assistant.

43:26.271 --> 43:27.606
You'll still have to come back.

43:27.981 --> 43:29.650
This is... this is really important.

43:29.733 --> 43:31.652
Uh, if she... if she reads me now

43:31.693 --> 43:33.779
she stands to learn a lot
about her own future.

43:34.321 --> 43:35.280
I can do it.

43:36.031 --> 43:37.074
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

43:39.201 --> 43:40.619
I've got it. It's no problem.

43:47.668 --> 43:51.296
I can easily just do a quick reading
and come right back.

43:56.969 --> 43:59.263
I know you're not here for a reading.
What do you want?

43:59.304 --> 44:00.639
Listen, we only have a few minutes.

44:00.681 --> 44:02.641
There's a man outside
that wants to kill me.

44:02.683 --> 44:04.893
Yeah, well,
I don't know how that affects me.

44:04.935 --> 44:07.437
Because he thinks that I'm your son, Pete.

44:08.981 --> 44:10.440
Pete's no longer in prison.

44:13.694 --> 44:15.529
I don't know who you think I am--

44:15.571 --> 44:16.864
You're, you're Maggie Murphy.

44:16.905 --> 44:19.950
Listen, we don't have time for
this, alright?

44:19.992 --> 44:21.910
They're not just after Pete.

44:22.202 --> 44:24.746
They're after your whole family,
Otto, Audrey...

44:24.788 --> 44:27.499
everyone, and I don't want anything
to happen to them either

44:27.541 --> 44:30.752
but it will unless you give back
the $11 million you stole.

44:37.050 --> 44:39.553
I... I had no idea it was that much.

44:40.220 --> 44:41.555
We never stopped to count it.

44:42.181 --> 44:43.140
Where is it?

44:44.057 --> 44:46.101
I don't know.
I thought they got it long ago.

44:46.143 --> 44:49.271
When that guy showed up in Sedona,
I thought that was about revenge.

44:49.813 --> 44:51.815
I thought they found it a long time ago.

44:52.649 --> 44:53.525
What?

44:55.027 --> 44:55.986
What's your name?

45:03.493 --> 45:04.369
Marius.

45:05.746 --> 45:07.456
You ever been on the run, Marius?

45:07.497 --> 45:08.540
My whole life.

45:09.541 --> 45:12.002
Yeah, well, I'm tired of running

45:12.920 --> 45:16.715
and I don't want my family
to pay for my mistakes, so...

45:18.300 --> 45:21.720
I want you to take me to those men.

45:21.762 --> 45:23.680
OK, we should talk about this.

45:23.722 --> 45:27.100
Uh, well, I'm, I'm...
I'm gonna square away Ethel

45:27.142 --> 45:28.143
and then we're gonna go.

45:45.285 --> 45:46.161
Julia!

45:47.371 --> 45:49.915
To what do I owe the pleasure?

45:50.290 --> 45:55.128
Oh, just a little thank-you gift for lunch
and for finding out Lance is in Florida.

45:55.170 --> 45:58.257
Oh, you shouldn't have.
I already owe you a lunch.

45:58.674 --> 46:01.301
We should do it soon.
Thank you so much.

46:01.468 --> 46:03.762
Oh, I'm sorry, what are you doing?

46:04.263 --> 46:06.515
This is gonna sound crazy
but can I come in?

46:07.099 --> 46:07.975
Why?

46:08.141 --> 46:11.103
I just have this weird need
to see inside your condo.

46:11.395 --> 46:13.772
You know what? That is a little weird.

46:13.814 --> 46:16.441
And now is really not a good time.

46:16.483 --> 46:19.236
- Um, hey, you can't just--
- I thought we were friends.

46:19.528 --> 46:21.280
Can't just come in here like this!

46:27.119 --> 46:28.245
Next time she lies for you

46:28.287 --> 46:30.163
at least tell her how much
you hate your mother

46:30.747 --> 46:32.165
and Florida.

46:33.583 --> 46:34.751
- Julia, I don't--
- Save it.

46:36.003 --> 46:37.045
You're coming with me.

46:45.304 --> 46:46.179
Maggie?

46:51.518 --> 46:52.394
Maggie?

46:54.062 --> 46:56.898
Spirit tells me you'll come in very slowly.

46:56.940 --> 47:00.861
Sit there with your hands visible
at all times

47:01.153 --> 47:03.530
or end up gut-shot on the floor.

47:05.449 --> 47:07.576
You're a criminal, aren't you?

47:09.494 --> 47:12.998
And you think it's all hogwash,
what we do, helping people

47:15.125 --> 47:17.961
letting their loved ones
find peace and move on.

47:18.003 --> 47:22.883
Oh, what a sad prism
with which to see the world.

47:23.175 --> 47:25.427
Reverend, um...

47:27.346 --> 47:29.765
I would love to debate this
with you right now

47:29.806 --> 47:31.892
but there's a man outside
who's looking for me.

47:32.642 --> 47:34.644
You mean the one standing
in the next room?

47:37.356 --> 47:39.524
Five seconds, I shoot through the wall!

47:44.196 --> 47:47.991
Uh-uh-uh!
I've already loaded a round, son.

47:48.575 --> 47:51.244
I'll blow your head clean off
before you can clear your gun.

47:52.496 --> 47:54.748
Not very spiritual,
pointing a gun at a man.

47:55.040 --> 47:56.750
Depends on the man.

47:58.418 --> 48:02.798
Gateway to reformation
never closed for any human soul

48:03.548 --> 48:04.633
here or hereafter

48:04.674 --> 48:08.762
which you will soon discover
if you don't put down the gun.

48:27.406 --> 48:29.616
Spirit is telling me something
about your brother

48:29.783 --> 48:31.660
not this one, your real brother.

48:34.037 --> 48:39.000
I'm getting that his name
starts with a T... no, an E.

48:40.961 --> 48:44.172
He is... he's missing something.

48:46.842 --> 48:49.469
No. Not, not, not a phone, not a wallet.

48:51.972 --> 48:53.140
Oh, my!

48:53.723 --> 48:54.724
A toe.

48:57.519 --> 48:59.062
How does he come to be missing a toe?

49:02.941 --> 49:05.444
Oh, come on.
You tell me the story of that toe.
