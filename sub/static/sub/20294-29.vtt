04:07.833 --> 04:10.233

TRYING TO MIND MY OWN
BUSINESS, BRO.

-ALL RIGHT, GO AHEAD

THAT'S ALL.

04:14.467 --> 04:16.067
-I WASN'T TRYING

04:16.133 --> 04:17.900
-WELL, STOPPED HIM

04:18.067 --> 04:19.967
WHEN I STARTED PATTING HIM
DOWN, I FELT A PIPE.

04:20.067 --> 04:23.300
AND RIGHT WHEN I FELT
THAT PIPE HE TOOK OFF.

04:23.400 --> 04:25.500
TACKLED HIM TO THE GROUND,

04:25.600 --> 04:27.767
AND WE GO THROUGH
A COUPLE BLOWS,

04:27.867 --> 04:29.533
AND WAIT FOR BACKUP, SO,

04:29.633 --> 04:31.067

04:31.100 --> 04:33.167
GRABBED HIS ARMS,
THREW HIM DOWN,

04:33.267 --> 04:36.133

04:38.200 --> 04:39.767

YOUR HEAD IS JACKED UP.
-IS IT?

04:43.467 --> 04:45.533
-AFTER WE ARRESTED HIM,
WE SEARCHED HIM.

04:45.633 --> 04:48.700
HE HAD, LIKE, A CRACK PIPE
ON HIM,

04:48.800 --> 04:52.067
AND HE HAD A SHANK--
LITTLE HOMEMADE KNIFE.

04:52.100 --> 04:54.067
-YEAH. HE WAS REACHING,
I THINK HE WAS REACHING
FOR HIS POCKET,

04:54.167 --> 04:55.700
SO ALMOST CAME TO DEADLY FORCE
REAL QUICK.

04:58.500 --> 04:59.700
-THIS IS THE WORST DAY
OF MY LIFE.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.367
-HEY, I'M SERGEANT JOHNSON.
WHAT HAPPENED?

05:02.467 --> 05:05.267

05:09.533 --> 05:12.067
-SO, YOU'RE JAYWALKING.
AND THEN THE OFFICER
CONTACTED YOU.

05:12.100 --> 05:14.267
-YEAH, YEAH, HE DID.
-HOW DOES THAT LEAD INTO
A FIGHT? WHAT HAPPENED?

05:14.367 --> 05:15.500
-NO, BECAUSE--

05:15.600 --> 05:17.933
BASICALLY, HE'S TRYING
TO, LIKE, DETAIN ME.

05:18.067 --> 05:19.500
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

05:19.600 --> 05:21.567
I WAS--
-YOU JUST SAID
YOU WERE JAYWALKING.

05:21.667 --> 05:24.567
-NO, I DID.
AND I WAS BEING VERY...

05:24.667 --> 05:26.967
YOU KNOW, UM, EASY--
EASY-GOING.

05:27.067 --> 05:29.833
-HOW DID THAT TRANSPIRE
INTO FIGHTING WITH MY OFFICER?

05:29.933 --> 05:31.733
-BECAUSE HE WAS...

05:31.833 --> 05:33.967
LIKE, AGGRESSIVELY,
YOU KNOW, KIND OF--

05:34.067 --> 05:36.800
AND I WAS WILLING
TO COMPLY.

05:36.900 --> 05:39.200
I WAS WILLING TO COMPLY,

05:39.300 --> 05:42.367
AND, LIKE, SOMETHING JUST
FELT LIKE HE WAS GONNA KICK
MY ASS IN THE FIRST PLACE.

05:42.467 --> 05:45.067
LIKE, THAT'S--
THAT'S WHAT IT FELT LIKE.

05:45.133 --> 05:46.100
AND HE DID!

05:46.200 --> 05:48.200
LOOK, LOOK, I NEVER
KNUCKLED WITH HIM.

05:48.300 --> 05:50.767
I'M A STRONG WRESTLER.
LIKE, I WENT TO A GOOD
HIGH SCHOOL.

05:50.867 --> 05:52.700
I WASN'T TRYING
TO RESIST IN THAT WAY.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.400
BUT HE WAS PUNCHING ME,

05:54.500 --> 05:56.333
AND I WASN'T PUNCHING.

05:56.433 --> 05:57.633
I WASN'T DOING ANY OF THAT.

05:57.733 --> 05:59.600
I WASN'T RESISTING.

05:59.700 --> 06:02.933
-SO, HE TOLD YOU TO ROLL OVER,
WHAT, ON YOUR-- FACE DOWN?
IS THAT WHAT HE TOLD YOU TO DO?

06:03.067 --> 06:04.500
-LOOK, HE TOLD ME--

06:04.600 --> 06:07.100
HE KEPT TELLING ME "ROLL OVER"
AS HE WAS PUNCHING ME
IN MY FACE.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.333
AND I COULDN'T--
ALL I COULD DO IS MOVE
OUT OF THE WAY.

06:09.433 --> 06:10.933
-YOU UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST NOW?

06:11.067 --> 06:12.500
HE STOPPED YOU
FOR JAYWALKING,

06:12.600 --> 06:15.233
WHICH, TYPICALLY,
THAT'S A CITATION.
-YEAH.

06:15.333 --> 06:16.833
-BUT THEN WHEN YOU FIGHT
WITH THE POLICE,

06:16.933 --> 06:18.367
YOU KNOW--
-I DIDN'T--
I DIDN'T FIGHT, SIR.

06:18.467 --> 06:20.467
-WHEN I GOT HERE,
YOU WERE FIGHTING WITH
MY OFFICER.

06:20.567 --> 06:22.567
-I WAS JUST TRYING
TO KEEP HIM OFF OF ME!

06:22.667 --> 06:27.067
I WAS JUST TRYING TO KEEP
HIM OFF OF ME, SIR. LIKE,
HE ATTACKED-- HE ATTACKED ME.

06:27.100 --> 06:30.067

ABOUT JAYWALKING.

06:30.100 --> 06:31.667
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE IT

06:31.767 --> 06:33.700
-ALL RIGHT, HANG ON.

06:35.233 --> 06:36.733
-ALL RIGHT.

06:36.833 --> 06:39.400
I TALKED TO YOUR
ARRESTEE A LITTLE BIT.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.500
HE SAID THAT HE WAS JAYWALKING.

06:41.600 --> 06:45.133
HE SAID THAT WHEN YOU STOPPED
TO TALK TO HIM

06:45.233 --> 06:48.433
THAT HE WAS TRYING TO BE
COMPLIANT. HE WANTED TO,

06:48.533 --> 06:50.933
BUT THEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN,

06:51.067 --> 06:53.167
-AND SO, UH...

DIFFERENT THAN WHAT HAPPENED.

06:53.267 --> 06:55.067

08:20.267 --> 08:22.300
-OKAY. MA'AM,
DO YOU HAVE YOUR I.D. ON YOU?

08:24.200 --> 08:25.867
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A SEAT
ON THE SIDEWALK.

08:25.967 --> 08:27.500
-DID WE DO SOMETHING WRONG?

08:27.600 --> 08:30.633
-IT'S JUST A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS.
I'M JUST GONNA DOCUMENT
WHO I'M TALKING TO

08:30.733 --> 08:32.900
AND THEN YOU'LL BE
ON YOUR WAY, ALL RIGHT?

08:33.067 --> 08:34.800
WHERE ARE YOU GUYS--
WHERE ARE YOU HEADED?

08:34.900 --> 08:37.533
-WE WERE AT THE CAPITOL HILL
MOTEL AND NOW WE'RE JUST--

08:37.633 --> 08:39.333
I FORGOT WHERE
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO GO,

08:39.433 --> 08:40.967
BUT LIKE I SAID TALKING
TO THE OTHER OFFICER,

08:41.067 --> 08:43.267
YOU KNOW, WE WERE ARGUING
A LITTLE BIT,

08:43.367 --> 08:45.867
AND OUT OF FRUSTRATION HE JUST
SAID, "FINE, WE'RE NOT
GONNA GO BACK.

08:45.967 --> 08:48.433
"I'M GONNA DO MY PROJECT."
THAT'S KIND WHAT HE LIKES
TO DO TO ME.

08:48.533 --> 08:51.300
LIKE, FRUSTRATE ME.

08:51.400 --> 08:53.533
-OKAY. ALL RIGHT,
AND YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE--

08:53.633 --> 08:55.833
YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
IN THE CAR YOU GUYS
AREN'T SUPPOSED TO HAVE?

08:55.933 --> 08:57.633
-NO. NO. NO. NOTHING LIKE THAT.
-NO GUNS, DRUGS?

08:57.733 --> 08:59.433
-THIS IS A MENTAL GAME FOR HIM.
-RIGHT.

08:59.533 --> 09:01.067
-SIR, DO YOU MIND IF
I TAKE A LOOK IN THERE?

09:01.133 --> 09:03.200
JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE
SHOOTING STRAIGHT WITH ME?

09:03.300 --> 09:05.600
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY DOPE
OR GUNS OR ANYTHING IN THERE?

09:05.700 --> 09:07.467
-WELL, I DON'T,
BUT I DON'T--

09:07.567 --> 09:10.533
ISN'T IT MY RIGHT TO, UH...

09:10.633 --> 09:14.267
THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF IN THERE
THAT'S BEEN IN THERE, YOU KNOW,
FOR A WHILE,

09:14.367 --> 09:17.133
-OKAY.
-SO, I WANT TO EXERCISE
MY RIGHT TO NOT--

09:17.233 --> 09:20.067
-OKAY. 'CAUSE I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I'M SEEING HERE.

09:20.133 --> 09:22.133
YOU HAD YOUR LITTLE
METH TORCH RIGHT THERE.

09:22.233 --> 09:24.933
YOU GUYS HAVE YOUR SYRINGES
DOWN ON THE FLOORBOARD
RIGHT HERE.

09:25.067 --> 09:26.433
OKAY?

09:26.533 --> 09:29.200
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE HELL
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE
RIGHT HERE.

09:29.300 --> 09:30.933
SOME SORT OF BONG?

09:31.067 --> 09:33.933
-I DON'T KNOW.
WE GOT A BUNCH OF CRAP IN THERE.
AND LOTS OF STUFF IS IN THERE.

09:34.067 --> 09:36.133
-THAT'S HIS BAD FOR BEING
OUT HERE AT THIS TIME
OF NIGHT.

09:36.233 --> 09:39.067
'CAUSE WE HAVE NO BUSINESS
BEING OUT HERE, AND THIS
IS WHAT HAPPENS.

09:39.167 --> 09:40.333
I'VE TRIED TO TELL HIM
THIS BEFORE,

09:40.433 --> 09:42.233
HE CAN GET ALL PISSED
OFF AT ME AS HE WANTS,

09:42.333 --> 09:45.533
BUT THIS IS JUST--
THERE'S NOTHING.

09:45.633 --> 09:47.733
IT'S JUST--
WE'RE WASTING
YOUR GUYS' TIME.

09:47.833 --> 09:50.267
-YES, WE'RE GOING TO BE
WASTING A LOT OF TIME TONIGHT.

09:50.367 --> 09:53.100
I MEAN, I'M SEEING--
I SEE YOU GUYS GOT, LIKE,
DOPE IN THE CAR.

09:53.200 --> 09:55.067
SO, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO HERE?

09:55.167 --> 09:57.700
YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME
TO LIMIT THE SCOPE OF
MY SEARCH AT ANY TIME.

09:57.800 --> 09:59.067
-YEAH, BUT WHEN--
OKAY, GO AHEAD.

09:59.167 --> 10:00.700
-OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.900
MA'AM, I'M GONNA HAVE YOU
GO AHEAD AND GET OUT.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.500
MA'AM, DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING
IN YOUR PURSE YOU'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO HAVE?

10:05.600 --> 10:07.133
-NO.
-THERE'S NO DOPE
IN THERE? NO GUNS?

10:07.233 --> 10:09.533
OKAY, CAN YOU JUST DO ME
A FAVOR AND JUST LEAVE IT
IN THE CAR FOR A SECOND?

10:09.633 --> 10:12.567
AND THEN I WILL HAND IT TO YOU,
BUT I DON'T WANT YOU REACHING
INTO STUFF AND GRABBING STUFF.

10:12.667 --> 10:13.967
YOU JUST STEP OUT
OF THE CAR.

10:14.067 --> 10:15.400
ALL RIGHT?

10:15.500 --> 10:17.433
THANK YOU.

10:17.533 --> 10:19.667
(sighs)

10:19.767 --> 10:21.800
ARE THESE YOUR NEEDLES HERE?

10:21.900 --> 10:23.000
-PARDON ME?

10:23.100 --> 10:24.833
-I NOTICE YOU GOT
THE NEEDLES EVERYWHERE.

10:24.933 --> 10:26.067
-THERE'S NOT NEEDLES EVERYWHERE.

10:26.167 --> 10:27.667
WE WERE CLEANING OUT
AN OLD BAG, AND SOMEBODY--

10:27.767 --> 10:30.067
ONE OF OUR FRIENDS
IS ACTUALLY A DIABETIC,

10:30.167 --> 10:32.267
BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA
BELIEVE THAT, SO...

10:32.367 --> 10:36.867
-WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE
EVER SEEN WHAT PEOPLE
WITH DIABETES SHOOT UP,

10:36.967 --> 10:39.600
BUT IT'S GENERALLY CLEAR,
AND THAT--

10:39.700 --> 10:41.200
-WELL, WE HAD OTHER PEOPLE
IN THE CAR TONIGHT,

10:41.300 --> 10:43.800
COUPLE OF SCUMBAGS--
SERIOUSLY, WE DID NOT
EVEN KNOW--

10:43.900 --> 10:45.567
HE WANTED TO GIVE
A RIDE TO FOR 30 BUCKS.

10:46.733 --> 10:47.933
SO, WHO KNOWS?

10:48.033 --> 10:50.333
-OKAY. I'M JUST TRYING
TO BE STRAIGHT WITH YOU GUYS.

10:50.433 --> 10:53.867
IF YOU GUYS JUST HAVE
A TEENY LITTLE BIT OF,
LIKE, PARAPHERNALIA, USER STUFF,

10:53.967 --> 10:56.200
OKAY, I'M IN AND OUT
OF YOUR LIFE, ALL RIGHT?

10:56.300 --> 10:58.900
UM, BUT YOU GUYS ARE KIND OF
BEING A PAIN IN THE BUTT,

10:59.000 --> 11:01.500
AND NOT-- JUST A SECOND.
-I'M USUALLY NOT LIKE THIS.

11:01.600 --> 11:02.567
-JUST A SECOND.

11:02.667 --> 11:04.400
WE CAN PLAY HARDBALL,

11:04.500 --> 11:07.067
OR YOU GUYS CAN LEVEL WITH ME.
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO RIGHT NOW?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:07.100 --> 11:09.067
-THAT'S THE TRUTH, SIR.
-I PROMISE YOU, SIR.

11:09.133 --> 11:11.200
-HE'S THAT MUCH OF A JERK,
AND I DON'T CARE

11:11.300 --> 11:13.767
THAT HE-- I WANTED
TO GO BACK TO THE ROOM,

11:13.867 --> 11:16.600
AND BECAUSE I DON'T SHUT UP
OR I DON'T DO A THING,

11:16.700 --> 11:18.933
HE WILL JUST,
"OH, WE'RE NOT GONNA GO BACK,
WE'RE JUST GONNA SIT HERE."

11:19.067 --> 11:20.467
-OKAY. HOW MUCH DOPE
DO YOU HAVE IN THE PURSE?

11:20.567 --> 11:21.633
-NONE.

11:21.733 --> 11:23.600
-CAN I GO AHEAD
AND LOOK IN YOUR PURSE NOW?

11:23.700 --> 11:25.067
-NO, SIR.

11:25.133 --> 11:27.267
THERE'S NO--
I HAVE NO-- THERE'S NO DOPE!
-WHAT DID HE TELL YOU?

11:27.367 --> 11:28.733
IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA--
-TURN AROUND.

11:28.833 --> 11:29.967
-NO, OKAY, YOU CAN
LOOK IN MY PURSE.

11:30.067 --> 11:31.567
OKAY, OKAY.
-NO, I--

11:31.667 --> 11:33.633
-OKAY, NO, FINE. NO.
-IT'S NO LONGER AN OPTION.
WE LOST THAT CHOICE.

11:33.733 --> 11:36.067
-PLEASE DON'T DO THIS TO ME SIR.
-PUT YOUR HANDS BEHIND
YOUR BACK, PLEASE.

11:36.167 --> 11:38.133
-PUT YOUR HANDS
BEHIND YOUR BACK.
-PLEASE DON'T DO THIS TO ME.

11:38.233 --> 11:39.900
-GO AHEAD AND LOOK IN MY PURSE.

11:40.067 --> 11:41.467
PLEASE, DON'T ARREST ME, SIR.
-OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

11:41.567 --> 11:42.600
YOU HAVE NO NEEDLES ON YOU?
-NO.

11:42.700 --> 11:44.067
-NOTHING THAT'S GONNA POKE ME
OR STICK ME?

11:44.133 --> 11:45.367
-PLEASE DON'T ARREST ME.
-OKAY.

11:45.467 --> 11:48.933
-I'M NOT A BAD GIRL, AND I'M--

11:49.067 --> 11:51.600
SWEAR TO GOD,
HE PROMISED ME THAT I'M NOT--

11:51.700 --> 11:53.200
I'M MORE SCARED OF HIM.
-OKAY.

11:53.300 --> 11:54.633
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE
A SEAT ON THE CURB HERE.

11:54.733 --> 11:57.733
CAN I GO AHEAD AND LOOK
IN THAT PURSE NOW, THEN?
-YEAH.

11:57.833 --> 11:59.433
-OKAY. WHY DON'T YOU
HAVE A SEAT.

11:59.533 --> 12:01.900
-BUT I DON'T KNOW.
LIKE I SAID, I DON'T KNOW--
-JUST SIT DOWN.

12:02.067 --> 12:03.867
OKAY?

12:03.967 --> 12:06.767
-I'M LETTING YOU KNOW, LIKE,
IF THERE'S ANYTHING ANYWHERE,
LIKE, I'LL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW,

12:06.867 --> 12:09.967
I'M NOT TAKING
THE FALL FOR ANYBODY.
THAT'S FOR DAMN SURE.

12:10.067 --> 12:11.567
HE'S SUCH A LIAR.

12:11.667 --> 12:14.300
I DO-- IF ANYTHING,
IT'S ONCE IN A WHILE,

12:14.400 --> 12:16.400
LIKE, I'LL TAKE A SHOT,
but THAT'S IT.

12:16.500 --> 12:17.833
-THIS YOUR METH PIPE?

12:17.933 --> 12:19.767
-NO-- WHAT? NO!

12:19.867 --> 12:21.433
NEGATIVE.

12:21.533 --> 12:23.100
REALLY?

12:23.200 --> 12:25.333
SEE, I KNEW HE WAS A--
THAT'S WHY HE DIDN'T WANT
YOU TO SEARCH MY PURSE.

12:25.433 --> 12:27.333
I WAS WONDERING BECAUSE I KNOW
THAT I DON'T HAVE NEEDLES.

12:27.433 --> 12:29.300
LOOK AT MY ARMS.
-YOU SMOKE HEROIN
IN THIS?

12:29.400 --> 12:31.400
-THIS ISN'T--
THIS LOOKS LIKE METH.
-NO. NO.

12:31.500 --> 12:34.400
IT'S USUALLY ON FOIL.
THAT'S JUST WHAT I'M
SAYING, I DON'T KNOW.

12:34.500 --> 12:37.100
BUT I HAVEN'T DONE DRUGS
MY WHOLE LIFE AT ALL.

12:37.200 --> 12:39.833
I'M 30, WHAT, EIGHT? 37, NOW?

12:39.933 --> 12:43.633
SEE, THAT'S WHY HE'S ALL CALM.
HE'S ALL HAPPY THAT IT'S ME
OVER HERE AND NOT HIM.

12:43.733 --> 12:47.600
-SO, ALL THOSE SYRINGES
ARE HERS, ALL OF THE PIPES HERS?

12:47.700 --> 12:50.367
NONE OF IT'S YOURS,
EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE A USER TOO?

12:50.467 --> 12:53.700
YOU'RE GONNA LET YOUR LADY
GO TO JAIL FOR YOUR SYRINGES
AND THE OTHER STUFF?

12:53.800 --> 12:55.700
-YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF IT WERE MINE--

12:55.800 --> 12:56.900
HERE, I'LL SAY THIS,

12:57.067 --> 12:59.800
IF IT WERE MINE,
I WOULD COP TO IT.

13:01.867 --> 13:03.900
THAT'S THE GOD'S HONEST TRUTH.

13:05.200 --> 13:06.133
-OKAY.

13:06.233 --> 13:07.767
I'M JUST GONNA
CHARGE HER WITH THE PIPE

13:07.867 --> 13:10.100
'CAUSE I DON'T FEEL LIKE
TRYING TO COLLECT ALL
THOSE LITTLE NEEDLES

13:10.200 --> 13:11.267
AND GET MYSELF STUCK.

13:11.367 --> 13:12.733
-SO, WILL IT BE
A BOOK AND RELEASE?

13:12.833 --> 13:14.867
-SHE'LL PROBABLY BE OUT
IN A FEW HOURS.

13:14.967 --> 13:17.567
ALL RIGHT?
-YEAH.

13:17.667 --> 13:19.400
-GOOD LUCK, MAN.
-THANK YOU.

13:21.367 --> 13:24.733
-ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA
CHARGE YOU WITH THE--
JUST THE METH PIPE,

13:24.833 --> 13:26.633
NOT WITH THE NEEDLES, OKAY?

13:26.733 --> 13:29.900
UH, THE METH PIPE
IS A MISDEMEANOR,

13:30.067 --> 13:33.167
THE NEEDLES ARE A FELONY.

13:33.267 --> 13:34.967
BUT YOU WILL PROBABLY
BE OUT IN A COUPLE HOURS.

13:35.067 --> 13:37.400
-CAN I HAVE MY--
YOU'RE NOT BRINGING MY PURSE?
YOU'RE NOT GONNA TAKE MY--

13:37.500 --> 13:39.067
-I AM NOT TOUCHING THAT PURSE

13:39.167 --> 13:42.233
WITH ALL OF THE NEEDLES
AND EVERYTHING THAT'S IN THAT.

13:42.333 --> 13:44.367
IT-- THAT IS WAY TOO DANGEROUS.

13:44.467 --> 13:45.467
ALL RIGHT?

13:48.833 --> 13:52.233
-WELL, I THINK BEING A POLICE
OFFICER IS ONE OF
THE MOST EXCITING,

13:52.333 --> 13:54.967
REWARDING OCCUPATIONS THERE ARE.

13:55.067 --> 13:58.133
WE'RE THERE TO HELP YOU,

13:58.233 --> 14:00.300
AND, YOU KNOW, FROM
THE MOST MINOR THING IS

14:00.400 --> 14:02.300
LETTING THEM USE
YOUR CELL PHONE

14:02.400 --> 14:05.067
SO THEY CAN CONTACT SOMEBODY
AND LET THEM KNOW THAT
THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY HOME.

14:05.100 --> 14:08.433
YOU KNOW? WE DO IT ALL.

14:08.533 --> 14:12.567
(radio chatter)

14:12.667 --> 14:15.767
WHAT'S THIS?
IT LOOKS LIKE TWO GUYS
ARE GETTING READY TO FIGHT.

14:15.867 --> 14:18.433
THEY'RE CHASING EACH OTHER
AROUND THE BUSH HERE.

14:18.533 --> 14:20.067
LET'S CHECK IT OUT.

14:25.367 --> 14:27.667
71-33, 468 TWO TIMES,

14:27.767 --> 14:31.600
POSSIBLY, I DON'T KNOW,
THEY WERE ABOUT TO 416.

14:31.700 --> 14:34.900
INTERSECTION OF
TORREY PINES AND LAKE MEAD.

14:39.067 --> 14:41.067
(siren wails)

14:45.967 --> 14:47.533
HEY, GUYS.

14:47.633 --> 14:48.967
-HEY, WE WERE JUST WALKING HOME.

14:49.067 --> 14:50.500
-WHAT'S GOING ON?
PUT THE BOX DOWN.

14:50.600 --> 14:52.133
-OH, MY GOD.

14:52.233 --> 14:53.833
I'M SORRY, MAN,
WE WERE JUST--

14:53.933 --> 14:55.300
-STEP IN FRONT OF THE CAR.
YOU TOO, SIR.

14:55.400 --> 14:57.133
-WE WERE JUST
WALKING HOME, MAN.
-STEP IN FRONT OF THE CAR.

14:57.233 --> 14:59.300
-WE WERE ON MY WAY HOME,
AND HE STARTED TRIPPING

14:59.400 --> 15:01.733
'CAUSE I HAD HIS PHONE
AND DIDN'T WANT
TO GIVE HIM HIS PHONE.

15:01.833 --> 15:03.067
-OKAY. WELL, THAT'S WHAT I SAW.

15:03.167 --> 15:05.067
-BECAUSE HE WENT AND SEEN
HIS EX-BOYFRIEND YESTERDAY.

15:05.167 --> 15:07.667
MY FEELINGS ARE HURT,
SO I DON'T WANT HIM
CALLING HIS EX-BOYFRIEND.

15:07.767 --> 15:10.300
-I'M JUST GONNA PAT YOU DOWN,
MAKE SURE YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY WEAPONS ON YOU, OKAY?

15:10.400 --> 15:11.867
-I DON'T. I PROMISE YOU.

15:11.967 --> 15:14.233
I DON'T--
THERE'S NOTHING ON ME.
I'M JUST--

15:14.333 --> 15:16.300
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO FIGHT WITH YOU, MAN.
-STEP BACK.

15:16.400 --> 15:18.600
-I'M SORRY, OFFICER.
-SPREAD YOUR FEET.

15:18.700 --> 15:21.467
IT WAS BOTH OF YOU THAT
I SAW, SO IT'S NOT JUST ON HIM.

15:21.567 --> 15:24.233
-NO, HE WAS CHASING ME.
I'M NOT GONNA ARGUE WITH YOU,
OFFICER, I UNDERSTAND.

15:24.333 --> 15:26.267
-I'M JUST SAYING,
I SAW BOTH OF YOU
-I APOLOGIZE. I APOLOGIZE.

15:26.367 --> 15:29.600
I'M SORRY FOR YELLING AT YOU
OR WHATEVER. I APOLOGIZE.

15:29.700 --> 15:31.800
-OKAY. I'M GONNA
GET YOUR INFORMATION.

15:31.900 --> 15:33.133
DON'T LIE TO ME.

15:33.233 --> 15:35.300
-OFFICER, I'M NOT GOING
TO LIE TO YOU, I HAVE A WARRANT.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.633
-WHAT DO YOU THINK
THE WARRANT'S FOR?

15:38.733 --> 15:41.300
-WELL, IT'S BECAUSE
I WENT TO MY COURT DATE,

15:41.400 --> 15:44.567
AND I WAS SITTING, AND I'D
ALREADY BEEN SICK FOR,
LIKE, TWO WEEKS,

15:44.667 --> 15:47.800
AND HIM AS MY WITNESS,
HE'LL TELL YOU, I WAS SITTING
IN THE COURT ROOM,

15:47.900 --> 15:51.400
AND I EVEN SIGNED IN FOR THE--
THE PLAINTI-- OR THE...

15:51.500 --> 15:53.433
WHAT'CHA CALL IT?
-YEAH, YOU SIGNED IN
WITH THE-- UH-HUH.

15:53.533 --> 15:54.933
-FOR THE PUBLIC DEFENDER
OR WHATEVER.
-MM-HMM.

15:55.067 --> 15:58.733
-AND I KIND OF WAS COUGHING
AND I POOPED ON MYSELF.

15:58.833 --> 16:01.533
AND I HAD POOP RUNNING DOWN
MY LEG AND I WAS SO EMBARRASSED,

16:01.633 --> 16:04.300
I JUST-- I RAN OUT
OF THE COURT ROOM,

16:04.400 --> 16:05.867
AND I JUST NEVER WENT
BACK IN THERE.

16:05.967 --> 16:08.167
BUT, I MEAN, I HAVE PLANS
ON GOING TO SQUASH MY WARRANT.

16:08.267 --> 16:10.833
-SO, WHAT WAS THE CHARGE
THAT YOU WERE GOING THERE FOR?

16:10.933 --> 16:12.167
-PETTY LARCENY.
-PETTY LARCENY.

16:12.267 --> 16:14.633
-OKAY, SO, YOU MIGHT
HAVE A PETTY LARCENY.

16:14.733 --> 16:16.667
