WEBVTT

00:03.804 --> 00:05.039
Previously on E.R.--

00:05.073 --> 00:06.340
I'm Gillian.

00:06.374 --> 00:07.741
I was working with Luka
and John in the Congo.

00:07.775 --> 00:09.110
We really haven't
had a chance

00:09.143 --> 00:10.578
to talk
about things.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.280
Like you and Luka having sex?

00:12.313 --> 00:13.714
We're not exclusive, right?

00:13.747 --> 00:15.516
No commitments,
no co-parenting.

00:15.549 --> 00:16.517
Keep it casual,

00:16.550 --> 00:17.451
okay?

00:17.485 --> 00:18.719
My dad's got
pneumonia.

00:18.752 --> 00:20.188
Been taking care of him
at home.

00:20.221 --> 00:21.522
I met a teacher recently.

00:21.555 --> 00:23.157
He's a nice man.

00:23.191 --> 00:25.226
Do you think you'd like
to go out sometime?
Sure.

00:25.259 --> 00:26.460
CARTER:
Hey, Abby,

00:26.494 --> 00:28.462
you're going
to be a great doctor.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:37.671 --> 00:38.672
Thank you.

00:38.706 --> 00:40.308
It's, uh, dum ke pasadey.

00:40.341 --> 00:42.543
One of my students'
parents gave me the recipe.

00:42.576 --> 00:44.112
So...

00:44.145 --> 00:45.613
( clears throat )

00:45.646 --> 00:47.415
Where were you born?

00:47.448 --> 00:48.749
Tell me about your parents,

00:48.782 --> 00:50.184
your first kiss.

00:50.218 --> 00:51.652
( laughs )

00:51.685 --> 00:52.753
Uh...

00:52.786 --> 00:54.255
( clears throat )

00:54.288 --> 00:55.389
You're terrible
at small talk.

00:55.423 --> 00:56.757
Well, they're quiet.

00:56.790 --> 00:58.526
We have to take advantage
of every minute.

00:58.559 --> 00:59.660
( sighs )

00:59.693 --> 01:01.195
All right. Uh,

01:01.229 --> 01:03.131
Sussex.

01:03.164 --> 01:04.465
Father's a surgeon,

01:04.498 --> 01:07.835
Mother's a university professor
in mathematics.

01:07.868 --> 01:10.138
Impossible.

01:10.171 --> 01:12.606
First real kiss.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.775
Neal Mitchell.

01:14.808 --> 01:17.145
Seventh grade.

01:17.178 --> 01:19.180
Your husband-- it was cancer,

01:19.213 --> 01:21.315
wasn't it?

01:31.925 --> 01:34.328
So, you're divorced?

01:34.362 --> 01:37.365
Uh, that's the story
on the school parking lot.

01:37.398 --> 01:40.334
But we were never
actually married.

01:40.368 --> 01:41.502
Oh.

01:41.535 --> 01:43.904
She left
when Syd was three weeks old.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.306
And Melissa was only 20.

01:45.339 --> 01:47.741
She was scared.

01:47.775 --> 01:50.644
Is it too spicy?

01:50.678 --> 01:53.347
But you-you like Indian food,
don't you?

01:53.381 --> 01:54.615
Yes.

01:54.648 --> 01:56.184
( laughs )

01:56.217 --> 01:57.651
I'm sorry.

01:57.685 --> 02:00.454
You know, I-I thought
because you were English.

02:00.488 --> 02:02.356
I thought all Brits, like...

02:02.390 --> 02:04.392
Here, let me fix you
something else.

02:04.425 --> 02:06.327
No, no, it's lovely.

02:15.403 --> 02:17.805
Daddy, we're tired
of drawing.

02:17.838 --> 02:19.473
Um, well, then,

02:19.507 --> 02:21.209
how about a movie?

02:21.242 --> 02:22.543
( knock at door,
French pop music plays )

02:22.576 --> 02:24.312
I'm here.

02:29.383 --> 02:31.552
Hi.

02:31.585 --> 02:32.753
Hi.

02:32.786 --> 02:34.222
Uh,

02:34.255 --> 02:35.556
I should have called.

02:35.589 --> 02:37.391
Alex went to the movies
with Austin,

02:37.425 --> 02:39.760
and-and I hadn't seen you
in a couple days.

02:39.793 --> 02:41.429
Yeah, I've been working nights.

02:41.462 --> 02:44.265
Yeah. I'm
on days.

02:44.298 --> 02:48.302
I thought you might want
to get some dinner or something.

02:48.336 --> 02:50.938
I can't.

02:50.971 --> 02:51.805
Yeah, I guess...

02:51.839 --> 02:53.241
( laughs )

02:53.274 --> 02:54.508
Yeah, I should have
called first.

02:54.542 --> 02:56.610
No big deal.
I will, uh...

02:56.644 --> 02:57.878
I'll see you at work.

02:57.911 --> 02:59.480
Yeah. Sorry.
No.

02:59.513 --> 03:00.514
No. Please.

03:00.548 --> 03:01.649
I'll see you tomorrow.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.651
Yeah, see you.

03:11.292 --> 03:12.526
Is the food here?

03:12.560 --> 03:13.827
Uh, no.

03:13.861 --> 03:14.995
Oh, too bad.

03:15.028 --> 03:17.698
I'm starving.

03:17.731 --> 03:19.400
( quiet laugh )

03:19.433 --> 03:21.569
Ooh.

04:13.787 --> 04:15.656
Mr. Welling, you
need to calm down,

04:15.689 --> 04:16.857
and then I can help you.

04:16.890 --> 04:19.660
I told you,
the VA burned all my files.

04:19.692 --> 04:21.529
Now, my back is killing me.

04:21.562 --> 04:22.796
I can barely walk!

04:22.830 --> 04:23.831
Whoa, you're standing.

04:23.864 --> 04:24.832
Look, it's a miracle.

04:24.865 --> 04:25.633
Morris,

04:25.666 --> 04:26.734
the guy needs psych.

04:26.767 --> 04:27.835
They've seen
him five times

04:27.868 --> 04:28.802
in the last
three months.

04:28.836 --> 04:30.037
He's not getting
admitted.

04:30.070 --> 04:31.572
Are you having any, uh,
suicidal thoughts?

04:31.605 --> 04:33.407
Hell, no. I'm not
going to kill myself.

04:33.441 --> 04:34.041
I'm going
to kill him.

04:34.074 --> 04:35.709
His B.P.'s elevated.

04:35.743 --> 04:37.010
We could call medicine,
see if they have a bed.

04:37.044 --> 04:38.746
Just let him go.
Why do you care?

04:38.779 --> 04:39.913
I'm going to frag
his redheaded ass.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.048
Then I'm gonna piss

04:41.081 --> 04:43.684
all over his
useless corpse.

04:43.717 --> 04:44.718
Mr. Welling.

04:44.752 --> 04:45.819
Hey, Mr.
Welling, wait!

04:45.853 --> 04:46.854
Hello.

04:46.887 --> 04:47.988
I'm going to make you cry.

04:48.021 --> 04:49.390
LOCKHART:
Hi.

04:49.423 --> 04:50.558
I love the smell

04:50.591 --> 04:53.761
of crazy in
the morning.

04:53.794 --> 04:54.828
Back on days?

04:54.862 --> 04:56.364
Yeah, till 6:00.

04:56.364 --> 04:56.997
You?

04:57.030 --> 04:58.566
7:00.

04:58.599 --> 05:00.468
Olecranon bursitis can
go home after Ancef,

05:00.501 --> 05:02.002
and bleeding
esophageal varices

05:02.035 --> 05:03.504
is on hold for
the GI lab.

05:03.537 --> 05:04.972
Can I at least
take off my coat first?

05:05.005 --> 05:07.841
Altered LOL is getting
sedated and scanned.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.410
She needs a
Foley and an NG.

05:09.443 --> 05:10.411
Thanks.

05:10.444 --> 05:11.979
See ya.

05:12.012 --> 05:13.514
PRATT:
Dr. Kovac, I need you

05:13.547 --> 05:15.449
to eyeball
a perilunate dislocation.

05:15.483 --> 05:16.417
What's this?

05:16.450 --> 05:17.551
I don't know.

05:17.585 --> 05:18.752
Weaver's office decided
it was time

05:18.786 --> 05:20.421
to box up all
the residency applications

05:20.454 --> 05:21.789
for the past ten years.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.056
I called
to have them picked up.

05:23.090 --> 05:24.692
Frank.

05:24.725 --> 05:26.627
And it would be my
privilege to call again.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.729
If you check his neuro-circ,
I can get him blocked.

05:28.762 --> 05:30.598
Uh, what is
with all these boxes, Frank?

05:30.631 --> 05:31.999
That's where
I keep my list

05:32.032 --> 05:33.567
of idiotic questions.

05:33.601 --> 05:34.768
RASGOTRA:
Dr. Chen,
this is Eliza.

05:34.802 --> 05:36.103
Two centimeter
laceration

05:36.136 --> 05:37.638
extending through
the vermilion border.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.006
I just split my lip is all.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.107
I promised we could
see her quickly?

05:40.140 --> 05:42.075
Oh. Hi, Eliza.
Let me see.

05:42.109 --> 05:44.612
Ooh, looks like
something got you pretty good.

05:44.645 --> 05:45.879
She wasn't aiming at me.

05:45.913 --> 05:47.581
Who?
As far as
I can tell,

05:47.615 --> 05:49.417
she had an altercation
with her girlfriend.

05:49.417 --> 05:50.584
Ooh, lesbian cat fight.

05:50.618 --> 05:51.985
Somebody grab a video camera.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.455
Chuny, can you please put Eliza
in curtain one

05:54.488 --> 05:56.824
and draw up 10cc's
of one percent with epi?

05:56.857 --> 05:57.725
Sure. Come on.

05:57.758 --> 05:59.059
Going to get her settled,

05:59.092 --> 06:01.061
and I'll talk you
through a three-layer closure.

06:01.094 --> 06:02.863
Hey, do you want me
to call social work,

06:02.896 --> 06:05.065
see if we can get her in one
of those BBL support groups?

06:06.033 --> 06:07.134
Big black lesbian.

06:07.167 --> 06:09.002
( chortles )

06:09.036 --> 06:10.471
You know what?

06:10.504 --> 06:11.572
You're a horrible man.

06:11.605 --> 06:13.040
Do you think
it's pleasant

06:13.073 --> 06:15.676
being greeted every day
with a fusillade of homophobic,

06:15.709 --> 06:17.445
xenophobic ranting from a bigot?

06:17.445 --> 06:19.046
From now on, I expect
nothing from you

06:19.079 --> 06:20.448
except silence.

06:20.448 --> 06:21.715
Blissful silence.

06:22.583 --> 06:23.851
Wow!

06:23.884 --> 06:25.986
Must be somebody's time
of the month.

06:27.087 --> 06:29.122
So, Gillian left me a message.

06:29.156 --> 06:30.658
I didn't know
she was in town.

06:30.691 --> 06:31.992
She wants us all
to get together and have dinner.

06:32.025 --> 06:33.527
I need two-doctor consent

06:33.561 --> 06:34.562
for an unaccompanied
13-year-old.

06:34.595 --> 06:35.796
Uh-huh. Sure.

06:35.829 --> 06:37.798
So, we can talk later

06:37.831 --> 06:39.467
about the, uh...
Yeah, right.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.901
( whistles )

06:40.934 --> 06:41.969
Dr. Carter, do you think
you have a second

06:42.002 --> 06:43.571
to take a look at him?

06:43.604 --> 06:45.138
Um....
Dr. Carter,
they're a minute out.

06:45.172 --> 06:48.008
Sorry, EMS is bringing in
a probable septic patient.

06:49.943 --> 06:51.679
Uh, he came in
on a bus all alone.

06:51.712 --> 06:54.715
He's kind of freaked out.
Mm.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.750
Woke up with right-sided
testicular pain.

06:56.784 --> 06:58.552
The school nurse sent him in.

06:58.586 --> 06:59.687
No nausea, no dysuria,

06:59.720 --> 07:01.855
no trauma, not on any meds.

07:02.956 --> 07:04.692
Any nausea?

07:04.725 --> 07:07.495
No. I said that.

07:09.730 --> 07:10.831
Hey, Brian.

07:10.864 --> 07:11.999
This is Dr. Kovac.

07:12.032 --> 07:13.066
He's going to check you out.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.167
Hi, Dr. Kovac.

07:14.201 --> 07:15.736
Nice to meet you.

07:15.769 --> 07:18.071
So, you're having some pain,
huh?

07:18.105 --> 07:20.140
It hurts a lot.

07:20.173 --> 07:22.510
TAGGART:
Did the school nurse
call your parents?

07:22.543 --> 07:23.744
No. I live with my dad.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.178
He had a meeting
this morning in Detroit.

07:25.212 --> 07:26.747
He's probably still
on the plane.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.215
Uh, was there anyone else
I can call?

07:28.248 --> 07:29.583
An older brother or sister,

07:29.617 --> 07:30.718
neighbor?

07:30.751 --> 07:31.785
No, ma'am, thank you.

07:31.819 --> 07:33.053
KOVAC:
Okay, Brian,

07:33.086 --> 07:34.688
I have to take a look.

07:37.591 --> 07:38.726
Sam,

07:38.759 --> 07:39.827
uh, can you get

07:39.860 --> 07:41.829
a container for the UA?

07:41.862 --> 07:43.130
Sure.

07:43.163 --> 07:44.197
Don't worry, Brian.

07:44.231 --> 07:46.534
Dr. Kovac is the best.

07:52.039 --> 07:53.674
She's really hot.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.578
Charlie Taslitz, 42,
fever and hypotension.

07:57.611 --> 07:59.613
Baseline brain injury,
but he's taken nosedive.

07:59.647 --> 08:01.615
Tried four sticks,
but I couldn't start a line.

08:01.649 --> 08:02.616
Where's all the blood from?

08:02.650 --> 08:03.751
He pulled out his PICC line.

08:03.784 --> 08:05.052
You're his nurse?
Daughter.

08:05.085 --> 08:06.554
I take care of him.

08:06.554 --> 08:07.755
All right, nice and easy,
one, two,

08:07.788 --> 08:09.122
three. Good.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.558
All right, he's burning up.

08:10.591 --> 08:12.025
Sepsis on top
of the blood loss.

08:12.059 --> 08:13.060
Rectal Tylenol?

08:13.093 --> 08:14.662
Yeah, and CBC, lytes.

08:14.695 --> 08:16.196
Type and cross for
four cultures times two.

08:16.229 --> 08:17.598
( man groaning )

08:17.631 --> 08:18.799
And hang
Zosyn and Vank.

08:18.832 --> 08:19.733
How are you doing,
Mr. Taslitz?

08:19.767 --> 08:20.968
He can't talk anymore.

08:21.001 --> 08:21.869
He can't walk or move
or anything.

08:21.902 --> 08:23.236
Did he have a stroke?

08:23.270 --> 08:25.172
No. He crashed his forklift
at work two years ago.

08:25.205 --> 08:26.239
A bunch of steel crushed him.

08:26.273 --> 08:27.575
He got brain damage.

08:27.575 --> 08:28.909
Uh, Dr. Chen?

08:28.942 --> 08:31.144
Hmm? Ooh, John.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.081
Do you clean his G-tube site?

08:34.114 --> 08:35.683
Twice a day.

08:35.716 --> 08:37.784
He used to be
at an extended care facility,

08:37.818 --> 08:39.086
but I wanted him
home with me.

08:39.119 --> 08:40.721
They showed me
how to do everything.

08:40.754 --> 08:42.054
Grab a fresh tube.

08:42.089 --> 08:43.256
( alarm )
TAGGART:
B.P.'s 82/58.

08:43.289 --> 08:44.892
CARTER:
Tank two liters of saline.

08:44.925 --> 08:45.693
( groans )
TAGGART:
I don't have a line.

08:45.726 --> 08:46.827
Are you hurting him?

08:46.860 --> 08:48.028
CARTER:
Try the, uh,
antecubital.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.797
I did.
It's completely sclerosed.

08:49.830 --> 08:52.132
CHEN:
Okay, we're going to have
to go central. Grab a kit.

08:52.165 --> 08:53.300
Um, Dahlia,

08:53.333 --> 08:55.102
your father has very low
blood pressure

08:55.135 --> 08:56.637
and a serious infection.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.005
I know. That's
why I called 911.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.072
We need to give him fluids
and antibiotics.

08:59.106 --> 09:00.841
But even if we do,

09:00.874 --> 09:02.242
there's a chance that
his heart could stop beating.

09:02.275 --> 09:03.844
Has he discussed his wishes
with you?

09:03.877 --> 09:05.613
I told you, he doesn't talk.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.014
Temp's 103.4.
CARTER:
Does he have a DNR?

09:07.047 --> 09:08.816
A do not resuscitate order?

09:08.849 --> 09:09.950
No, no, no, he doesn't have
anything like that.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.018
You have to help him.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.052
Okay.

09:12.085 --> 09:13.887
CHEN:
Page Corday.

09:15.823 --> 09:17.658
Could you see
through someone's
clothes with this?

09:17.691 --> 09:18.959
Nope, doesn't work.

09:18.992 --> 09:21.128
Already tried.

09:22.129 --> 09:24.097
How you doing, Brian?

09:24.131 --> 09:26.066
Much better,
thank you.

09:26.099 --> 09:28.035
Morphine's kicking in.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.136
I'll go check
on your urinalysis, okay?

09:30.938 --> 09:31.905
I'll page urology.

09:31.939 --> 09:32.940
No.

09:32.973 --> 09:33.707
The ultrasound is normal.

09:33.741 --> 09:34.875
It's not surgical.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.076
Doppler's not
100% sensitive,

09:36.109 --> 09:37.377
especially with
all that edema.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.046
He's got a positive
Prehn's sign,

09:39.079 --> 09:41.381
a normal cremasteric reflex
and a low-grade temperature.

09:41.414 --> 09:42.950
It's probably epididymitis.

09:42.983 --> 09:44.217
He's a kid with
possible torsion.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.352
He only has a
six-hour window.

09:45.385 --> 09:46.754
He could lose
his testicle.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.188
We wait for his urine
to comeback, okay?

09:48.221 --> 09:49.322
Are you mad at me?

09:49.356 --> 09:50.924
He's got a good
blood flow.

09:50.958 --> 09:52.760
No, not for that.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.161
For coming over last night.

09:55.062 --> 09:56.930
No. It was fine.

09:56.964 --> 09:58.932
Because what I said before--
I didn't mean

09:58.966 --> 10:01.034
that we shouldn't see each other
at all.

10:05.005 --> 10:06.674
I didn't mean
to hurt your feelings.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.844
You want things to be casual.

10:10.878 --> 10:13.246
Right, but...

10:13.280 --> 10:15.215
if it's a choice
between something serious

10:15.248 --> 10:17.417
or nothing,

10:17.450 --> 10:19.119
maybe serious is the way to go.

10:21.154 --> 10:22.923
PRATT:
Hey, Sam?

10:22.956 --> 10:26.193
Yeah. I got it.

10:26.226 --> 10:29.129
Sam, uh, maybe you
should page urology?

10:29.162 --> 10:30.197
You think?

10:30.230 --> 10:32.833
Yeah. Better
to be safe.

10:35.435 --> 10:36.904
Adam Grant,

10:36.937 --> 10:39.439
61-year-old slip
and fall with no LOC.

10:39.472 --> 10:42.209
B.P. 136/72,
pulse 106.

10:42.242 --> 10:43.911
Mucho ETOH
on board.

10:43.944 --> 10:46.113
Wow, nice
breath.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.881
Tequila. Breakfast
of champions.

10:47.915 --> 10:50.784
Sam, start an IV,
hang a banana bag and call CT.

10:50.818 --> 10:53.020
You guys hear
on the news?

10:53.053 --> 10:55.022
Some guy robbed the
National Guard armory.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.323
Stole a frigging tank.

10:56.356 --> 10:57.858
I mean, it's
all over the news.

10:57.891 --> 10:59.326
A tank tank?

10:59.359 --> 11:00.761
Yeah, George Patton,

11:00.794 --> 11:01.962
big turret,
armor, treads.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.130
The whole deal.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.331
Come on, big guy.

11:04.364 --> 11:05.465
You got this?

11:05.498 --> 11:08.301
Yup.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.337
You have beautiful skin.

11:10.370 --> 11:12.740
Leave me
alone, Morris.

11:14.474 --> 11:16.009
That thing's gigantic.

11:16.043 --> 11:18.812
60 tons
of American firepower.

11:18.846 --> 11:22.950
Don't hit
the newsstand.

11:22.983 --> 11:24.184
FRANK:
Anybody need
any kindling?

11:24.217 --> 11:25.285
LOCKHART:
Excuse me?

11:25.318 --> 11:26.319
MORRIS:
What, what?

11:26.353 --> 11:28.421
Look.

11:32.259 --> 11:33.360
Oh, crap.

11:33.393 --> 11:35.428
FRANK:
Hope he doesn't have any ammo.

11:35.462 --> 11:36.997
DUVATA:
The guys from the
National Guard
say he doesn't.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.231
FRANK:
We're going to believe them?

11:38.265 --> 11:39.466
They're the ones
that let him steal

11:39.499 --> 11:42.302
the damn thing
in the first place.

11:43.536 --> 11:44.872
Where's he headed, do you think?

11:44.905 --> 11:46.039
Here.

11:46.073 --> 11:48.041
What?

11:48.075 --> 11:50.811
He-He's headed here.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.782
Tell 'em.

11:54.782 --> 11:56.383
He said he was going
to get a tank

11:56.416 --> 11:58.786
and blow my ass up.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.821
( sighs )

12:04.958 --> 12:06.026
Kelly.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.862
Tank's moving pretty fast.

12:08.896 --> 12:10.831
It has a top speed
of 35 miles per hour

12:10.864 --> 12:12.265
on the open road.

12:12.299 --> 12:14.034
That's what
they said on CNN.

12:14.067 --> 12:17.871
I had an '88 Civic
that couldn't do 35.

12:17.905 --> 12:19.272
He's tachy, 130.

12:19.306 --> 12:20.440
Are you hurting him?

12:20.473 --> 12:22.242
We numbed the skin.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.177
Cordis introducer.

12:24.211 --> 12:26.046
His pressure's down
to 74 systolic.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.180
Uh, why don't you
wait outside?

12:27.214 --> 12:28.281
We'll come find you

12:28.315 --> 12:29.316
the second we're done.

12:29.349 --> 12:30.350
No, I want to stay.

12:30.383 --> 12:31.418
Excuse me.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.053
He going to
be okay now?

12:33.086 --> 12:34.221
We can give him
medicine and fluids,

12:34.254 --> 12:35.355
but he's still
very sick.

12:35.388 --> 12:38.158
He's strong, you don't know.

12:38.191 --> 12:40.928
Four-oh vicryl
and a needle driver.

12:40.961 --> 12:43.263
Oh, what a mess.

12:43.296 --> 12:44.397
You doing hernia repairs

12:44.431 --> 12:46.199
in the ER now?

12:46.233 --> 12:48.836
No. Mister Taslitz needed access
for blood and pressors.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.437
I'm here to replace
his PICC line.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.405
I put it in three months ago.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.174
Well, thanks
for stopping by,

12:54.207 --> 12:57.044
but he has a lovely
femoral cutdown, instead.

12:57.077 --> 12:59.847
Dress the wound
and repeat the crit.

13:03.550 --> 13:06.453
I, uh, I don't appreciate
you poaching my cases.

13:06.486 --> 13:09.222
And when your cutdown
gets infected, call me.

13:09.256 --> 13:12.359
I can assure you
I washed my hands.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.394
We still on for
dinner tonight?

13:16.396 --> 13:18.365
You find a sitter?

13:18.398 --> 13:19.566
Yes.

13:19.599 --> 13:21.935
Great, I'll call
you about 7:00.

13:24.504 --> 13:26.006
He's doing better.

13:26.039 --> 13:28.408
His pressure's
up to 88 over 57.

13:28.441 --> 13:30.077
How do they do that?

13:30.110 --> 13:31.344
Who?

13:31.378 --> 13:32.980
Men. They argue
with you one minute

13:33.013 --> 13:34.381
and chat about dinner
the next.

13:34.414 --> 13:36.583
You're asking
the wrong girl.

13:36.616 --> 13:38.285
Mister Taslitz' tachycardia's
resolving

13:38.318 --> 13:39.519
and he's starting to perfuse.

13:39.552 --> 13:41.188
Thanks.

13:41.221 --> 13:43.523
Transfuse to a crit above 30,
then titrate the dopamine.

13:43.556 --> 13:44.992
Okay, but, uh...

13:45.025 --> 13:46.193
he better start
making urine soon

13:46.226 --> 13:47.194
or he's going
to need dialysis.

13:47.227 --> 13:48.896
Yeah.

13:48.929 --> 13:51.598
Doctor Chen, I don't think
the daughter really understands

13:51.631 --> 13:54.134
how serious her dad's
condition is.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.568
He's responding
to treatment.

13:55.602 --> 13:57.037
He's got a good chance.

13:57.070 --> 13:58.906
A good chance at what?

13:58.939 --> 14:00.440
Being in a vegetative state
for the rest of his life?

14:00.473 --> 14:02.209
Look, he didn't sign
an advanced directive.

14:02.242 --> 14:04.277
His daughter's responsible
for his medical decisions.

14:04.311 --> 14:05.612
She's 19.

14:05.645 --> 14:07.981
And she knows her dad
better than we do.

14:08.015 --> 14:10.217
Okay. So if he arrests,
do we shock him?

14:10.250 --> 14:13.286
Yeah, if that's
what she wants.

14:17.024 --> 14:18.425
He's turning right
on Wells again.

14:18.458 --> 14:19.960
He keeps going in circles.

14:19.993 --> 14:21.628
Guy's probably
just out having fun.

14:21.661 --> 14:22.930
Doesn't he have
a map in there?

14:22.963 --> 14:24.364
GPS or something?

14:24.397 --> 14:28.101
He's got GPS, night vision,
laser targeting.

14:28.135 --> 14:30.337
And this one uses those
uranium-tipped shells, too.

14:30.370 --> 14:33.006
He starts shooting,
you grab your gonads.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.976
RollingDeath.com.

14:36.009 --> 14:37.477
All right, back to work, people.

14:37.510 --> 14:39.079
It's not the moon landing.

14:39.112 --> 14:40.513
Where is this lunatic?

14:40.547 --> 14:41.514
He's crossing Monroe.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.116
Six miles,
as the crow flies.

14:43.150 --> 14:44.117
WEAVER:
How long till
he gets here?

14:44.151 --> 14:45.452
DEMETRAS:
He won't.

14:45.485 --> 14:47.254
We got roadblocks
on Adams and Jackson.

14:47.287 --> 14:48.621
If he's coming here, we'll
feed him onto the Eisenhower,

14:48.655 --> 14:50.157
force him to run out of gas.

14:50.190 --> 14:51.091
That's your plan?

14:51.124 --> 14:52.292
Let him run out of gas?

14:52.325 --> 14:53.360
They're also getting
a helicopter

14:53.393 --> 14:54.995
with a gigantic magnet.

14:55.028 --> 14:56.296
Really?

14:58.298 --> 14:59.499
Doctor Lockhart,

14:59.532 --> 15:01.168
you treated this guy.
What was his story?

15:01.201 --> 15:03.070
There was no physical
explanation for his pain.

15:03.103 --> 15:04.972
He was just angry because we
couldn't help him.

15:04.972 --> 15:06.373
There was nothing
wrong with him.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.475
You keep telling me
to dispo patients faster.

15:08.508 --> 15:09.576
Nobody said
you did anything wrong.

15:09.609 --> 15:11.144
PRATT:
Hey, hey, check it out.

15:11.178 --> 15:13.013
He's about to hit
the roadblock at Adams.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.117
BOTH:
Damn.

15:19.019 --> 15:21.154
You got a plan B, Detective?

15:21.188 --> 15:23.190
Oh, my God.
He's coming for us.

15:23.223 --> 15:25.392
Not us, pal, you.

15:25.425 --> 15:26.693
BOY:
Built models of Shermans

15:26.726 --> 15:29.062
and Tigers,
but never an M-60.

15:29.096 --> 15:30.363
Hmm. My son's
almost your age.

15:30.397 --> 15:31.999
He makes models.

15:31.999 --> 15:34.401
He likes to blow them
up with firecrackers.

15:35.702 --> 15:38.005
Did you figure out
what's wrong with me yet?

15:38.038 --> 15:39.272
Your urine test came back.

15:39.306 --> 15:42.042
It's positive
for chlamydia.

15:42.075 --> 15:44.711
What's that?

15:44.744 --> 15:47.747
It's a sexually
transmitted infection.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.417
You're having sex, Brian?

15:50.450 --> 15:52.019
I hook up sometimes.

15:52.052 --> 15:55.022
With who?

15:55.055 --> 15:57.224
Girls in my class,
like after school.

15:57.257 --> 15:58.558
Girls?
Like more than one?

16:01.228 --> 16:03.696
You're 13.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.598
How do I get rid of it?

16:05.632 --> 16:07.267
Uh...

16:07.300 --> 16:08.701
You don't have
to cut anything, do you?

16:08.735 --> 16:11.771
One dose of antibiotics,
and you'll be cured.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.173
Cool.

16:13.206 --> 16:14.674
Cool?

16:14.707 --> 16:16.776
You have to tell these girls
to get treated, okay?

16:16.809 --> 16:18.711
Chlamydia can be very serious.

16:18.745 --> 16:22.115
We'll get you
some STD handouts
to give to them.

16:23.450 --> 16:24.751
Okay.

16:27.554 --> 16:30.057
A 13-year-old kid
with chlamydia.

16:30.057 --> 16:33.226
Consent him for an HIV test
and give him some condoms.

16:33.260 --> 16:34.561
Is that what I have
to look forward to?

16:34.594 --> 16:35.628
Doctor Kovac?

16:35.662 --> 16:36.563
TAGGART:
See you later.

16:38.065 --> 16:40.167
19-year-old female
with buttock pain

16:40.200 --> 16:42.102
after ice skating pileup.

16:42.135 --> 16:43.770
Minimally displaced
coccyx fracture.

16:43.803 --> 16:46.806
Give her some naprosyn
and a donut cushion.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.808
What's this, duplicate film?

16:48.841 --> 16:52.345
No, twins.
Blonde twins.

16:54.114 --> 16:55.548
They never came
for the boxes?

16:55.582 --> 16:57.517
I'm filing them under "D"
for Dumpster.

16:57.550 --> 16:58.785
Just put them
in the storage room, okay?

16:58.818 --> 16:59.552
Ca va?

16:59.586 --> 17:01.421
Hey.

17:01.454 --> 17:03.656
I had to drop off
my carte jaune
at the consulate

17:03.690 --> 17:05.192
and the traffic's awful, so...

17:05.224 --> 17:06.559
Yeah, someone
stole a tank.

17:06.593 --> 17:07.727
I know, I heard.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.128
Americans
and their big cars.

17:09.162 --> 17:10.363
Um, do you have
time for coffee?

17:10.396 --> 17:12.165
Double MVA rolling up.

17:12.199 --> 17:13.733
Sorry. We're
kind of swamped.

17:13.766 --> 17:15.167
Okay, later then.
Around 6:00?

17:15.202 --> 17:16.569
Okay.

17:16.603 --> 17:18.271
And I want to do
something fun, like dancing.

17:18.305 --> 17:19.406
Okay.

17:22.309 --> 17:23.643
Bye.

17:23.675 --> 17:25.712
BP 102 over 78 after two liters,
tachy at 112.

17:25.744 --> 17:27.513
Easy, Mister Rojas.
He's right behind us.

17:27.547 --> 17:28.748
( speaking Spanish )

17:28.781 --> 17:29.782
You need me?

17:29.816 --> 17:30.850
I got this.
Help Pratt.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.152
Who was that?

17:32.185 --> 17:33.320
Uh, she's Gillian.

17:33.353 --> 17:34.687
Oscar Rojas, seven years old.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.156
Pinned behind
the passenger seat.

17:36.189 --> 17:37.690
GCS 15, in respiratory distress.

17:37.724 --> 17:38.791
( Oscar screaming in Spanish )

17:38.825 --> 17:40.227
One, two, three.

17:40.260 --> 17:41.494
( Rojas screaming in Spanish )

17:41.528 --> 17:42.595
CARTER:
Easy, Mister Rojas.

17:42.629 --> 17:44.131
( tries to speak Spanish )

17:44.131 --> 17:45.432
Tell him we're taking
care of his son.

17:45.465 --> 17:46.733
( speaks Spanish )

17:46.766 --> 17:48.135
Bilateral femur fractures.

17:48.135 --> 17:49.602
Probably the pelvis, too.

17:49.636 --> 17:50.637
He screamed
when we put him on the board.

17:50.670 --> 17:51.871
( screaming )

17:51.904 --> 17:53.140
CARTER:
Okay, okay, calm down.

17:53.140 --> 17:54.341
Head-on collision?

17:54.374 --> 17:55.608
Nope. Ford truck
versus M-60 tank.

17:55.642 --> 17:56.876
Your boyfriend
better learn to drive.

17:56.909 --> 17:57.844
ROJAS:
Oscar!

17:57.877 --> 17:59.379
Calmase, Senor Rojas.

17:59.412 --> 18:00.447
Equal and reactive.
Good breath sounds.

18:00.480 --> 18:01.248
Okay, Neela, what do we do?

18:01.281 --> 18:02.715
Full trauma panel...

18:02.749 --> 18:05.218
LOCKHART:
C-spine, chest and AP pelvis,
and a foley.

18:05.252 --> 18:07.154
Chuny, grab a central line
and set up...

18:07.154 --> 18:09.189
Easy. I think we should
be okay with two large...

18:09.222 --> 18:11.158
He's running people
over out there.

18:11.191 --> 18:12.625
( Rojas screaming Spanish )

18:12.659 --> 18:13.860
He wants you
to find his wife, Maria.

18:13.893 --> 18:15.295
Let's see if we
can find his wife,

18:15.328 --> 18:16.729
and then see
if Luka needs a hand.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.265
( screaming in Spanish )

18:18.298 --> 18:22.535
Frank, can you locate
a Maria Rojas?

18:22.569 --> 18:24.637
You got the area code
for Guadalajara?

18:24.671 --> 18:27.207
Just find this
man's wife, please.

18:27.240 --> 18:31.644
( Rojas screaming and gasping )

18:33.380 --> 18:34.481
Hold on a minute.

18:34.514 --> 18:36.616
I'm calling from...

18:39.586 --> 18:41.188
( gasps )

18:42.855 --> 18:45.492
( groans )

18:50.663 --> 18:53.200
PRATT:
I'm going to need
you to take

18:53.200 --> 18:54.267
some deep
breaths, Oscar.

18:54.301 --> 18:55.502
I knew her before in Africa.

18:55.535 --> 18:56.636
She's just visiting.

18:56.669 --> 18:57.637
You want blood?

18:57.670 --> 18:59.206
Yeah, two bags of O-neg.

18:59.206 --> 19:00.273
( screaming in Spanish )

19:00.307 --> 19:01.374
ROJAS:
Oscar!

19:01.408 --> 19:02.575
I need a suture kit.

19:02.609 --> 19:04.344
OSCAR:
Papi!

19:04.377 --> 19:05.712
Looks like multiple rib

19:05.745 --> 19:07.214
fractures with flail
segments on the right.

19:07.214 --> 19:08.581
Hey, what the hell
was that?

19:10.250 --> 19:11.918
I need a suture kit.

19:11.951 --> 19:15.455
Please. I'd like it on the
Mayo stand with 3-0 vicryl.

19:15.488 --> 19:16.856
You two need me
to call Dr. Phil?

19:16.889 --> 19:19.226
Sats are falling,
88 percent.

19:19.226 --> 19:20.560
All right, let's prep
for a chest tube.

19:20.593 --> 19:21.728
Breath sounds are
down on the right.

19:21.761 --> 19:23.396
Oscar, I'm going

19:23.430 --> 19:25.832
to put some cold stuff
on you, okay? Frio.

19:25.865 --> 19:27.967
ROJAS:
Oscar!

19:28.000 --> 19:28.935
Papi!

19:28.968 --> 19:30.403
( gasping )

19:30.437 --> 19:33.840
Oscar, this is going
to pinch a little, okay?

19:38.245 --> 19:40.613
Hey, you have
to stay still, okay?

19:40.647 --> 19:41.781
No, no, no, you have
to stay still, okay?

19:41.814 --> 19:42.815
( gasping )

19:42.849 --> 19:43.750
Chest tube prep.

19:43.783 --> 19:44.484
Push that lido.

19:44.517 --> 19:45.652
He keeps moving.

19:45.685 --> 19:46.819
I'm not cutting
this kid open

19:46.853 --> 19:48.288
without numbing
him up first.

19:48.321 --> 19:49.756
His BP's falling fast.
Sam, get Chuny

19:49.789 --> 19:51.258
to get some help here.

19:51.291 --> 19:52.925
She's busy.
Grab the portable oxygen.

19:52.959 --> 19:54.394
He's on the wall line.

19:54.427 --> 19:56.329
PRATT:
Come on, do something.

19:58.998 --> 20:00.967
Oscar!

20:01.000 --> 20:03.002
( Rojas speaking Spanish )

20:03.035 --> 20:05.305
OSCAR:
Papi!

20:05.338 --> 20:06.339
Oscar, there's
your papi.

20:06.373 --> 20:07.374
Papi?

20:07.407 --> 20:09.242
See him?
See him?

20:09.276 --> 20:11.278
( speaking Spanish )

20:15.315 --> 20:16.383
PRATT:
All right, 10 blade.

20:16.416 --> 20:18.418
ROJAS:
Oscar.

20:18.451 --> 20:19.819
TAGGART:
Shh, he's right there.

20:19.852 --> 20:21.421
( Oscar sobs quietly )

20:21.454 --> 20:23.022
Okay, get plastics
to check this facial lac.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.757
I'll call.

20:32.465 --> 20:33.500
Oh, my God.

20:33.533 --> 20:35.902
Frank? Wake up.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.338
Come on, Frank.

20:38.371 --> 20:40.307
Breathe!

20:40.340 --> 20:42.809
I need some help in here!

20:47.814 --> 20:49.316
What happened now?

20:49.349 --> 20:50.550
What'd he do, choke
on a doughnut? Oh, man.

20:50.583 --> 20:51.418
Draw troponin, lytes,
CPK, coags,

20:51.451 --> 20:52.485
type and cross for four.

20:52.519 --> 20:53.586
What happened?

20:53.620 --> 20:55.555
He's having a huge anterior MI.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.056
You, grab a gurney.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.325
Spontaneous resps on ten liter
non-rebreather.

20:58.358 --> 20:59.492
Last BP 102 over 60.

20:59.526 --> 21:00.760
He needs metroprolol.

21:00.793 --> 21:01.828
As soon as the bradycardia
resolves.

21:01.861 --> 21:02.862
Push 5000 of heparin.

21:02.895 --> 21:03.696
Done.

21:03.730 --> 21:04.697
Oh, no. MI?

21:04.731 --> 21:06.433
How'd you guess?
Come on, up.

21:06.466 --> 21:08.668
I gave him 325 of aspirin.
He's on oh-two. What else?

21:08.701 --> 21:10.437
Duvata, call cards, tell them
we've got one for the cath lab.

21:10.470 --> 21:12.071
All right, everybody grab hold.
Ready?

21:12.104 --> 21:13.906
( all groan )

21:13.940 --> 21:16.643
He sucks down fried chicken
for 30 years, now we gotta pay.

21:17.710 --> 21:20.079
All right, slide him up.

21:20.112 --> 21:20.947
Pratt, you go with him.

21:20.980 --> 21:21.914
I have patients.

21:21.948 --> 21:23.450
I'll cover.
Stay with him.

21:23.483 --> 21:24.884
I want somebody there
when he wakes up.

21:24.917 --> 21:26.519
Is there anyone we should call?
Does he have a family?

21:26.553 --> 21:28.054
Only thing I know
about his miserable life

21:28.087 --> 21:29.522
is that you just saved it.

21:32.392 --> 21:34.361
( sighs )

21:34.361 --> 21:35.628
An hour ago, you told me
not worry.

21:35.662 --> 21:36.996
And now you want me to evacuate

21:37.029 --> 21:38.465
because you can't stop
one wacko?

21:38.498 --> 21:39.699
Just consider it
as a precaution.

21:39.732 --> 21:41.401
I got snipers up on the roof,

21:41.434 --> 21:43.603
snowplows blocking
my ambulance bay...

21:43.636 --> 21:45.372
Doctor Weaver, if I'm
endangering any lives,

21:45.372 --> 21:47.073
I'm willing to leave.

21:47.106 --> 21:49.075
Good, why don't you go stand
in the middle of Lakeshore Drive

21:49.108 --> 21:51.378
and play Tiananmen Square?

21:51.411 --> 21:52.645
She has a boyfriend.

21:52.679 --> 21:54.013
That's nice.

21:54.046 --> 21:55.648
You said you didn't
want to be exclusive.

21:55.682 --> 21:56.649
I said it four days ago.

21:56.683 --> 21:57.784
I forgot she was coming.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.519
You know what?
I don't care.

21:59.552 --> 22:01.654
It's fine, Luka.
It's fine.

22:01.688 --> 22:03.856
You think I really care
how many little French
girls you're screwing?

22:03.890 --> 22:06.559
You already nailed
every nurse in the E.R.

22:08.995 --> 22:11.130
Dr. Kovac, sir?

22:11.163 --> 22:12.699
Uh, I called on my cell.

22:12.732 --> 22:13.833
They took the bus over.

22:13.866 --> 22:15.568
You said they needed
to get treated.

22:17.837 --> 22:20.773
Hi, I'm, um, Dr. Kovac.

22:20.807 --> 22:22.409
It's very important
for all of you

22:22.409 --> 22:23.710
to get checked today.

22:23.743 --> 22:27.847
Because Brian gave
us chlamydia, right?

22:27.880 --> 22:29.882
Listen, I-I know you're
all experimenting,

22:29.916 --> 22:31.584
but having sex
at your age,

22:31.618 --> 22:37.557
and with people you don't have
any feelings for...

22:37.590 --> 22:39.592
Y-You... you may regret it
later.

22:51.604 --> 22:53.806
Hey, look who's awake.

22:53.840 --> 22:57.477
I'll call your daughter
for you, all right?

22:57.510 --> 23:01.748
Whoa. You need that line
for your medication.

23:01.781 --> 23:04.551
( whimpers )

23:07.119 --> 23:09.689
Do you want to be
treated, Mr. Taslitz?

23:16.729 --> 23:19.766
If your heart stops...

23:19.799 --> 23:22.101
or you stop breathing,

23:22.134 --> 23:26.005
do you want us to
use heroic measures
to keep you alive?

23:27.907 --> 23:30.777
Or should we stop?

23:33.680 --> 23:37.784
Blink twice if you think
we should stop.

23:40.687 --> 23:42.221
KAYSON:
There's the occlusion...

23:42.254 --> 23:44.624
right there.
FRANK:
Connie?

23:44.657 --> 23:46.092
PRATT:
Hey, what's up, Frank?

23:46.125 --> 23:47.494
You're in the cath lab.

23:47.494 --> 23:48.828
What are you doing to me?

23:48.861 --> 23:50.129
You had a heart attack.

23:50.162 --> 23:52.098
If we can open up the blockage
in your artery,

23:52.131 --> 23:54.501
it'll save you
from bypass surgery.

23:54.501 --> 23:55.935
KAYSON:
Whoa, L.A.D.'s
down to nothing.

23:55.968 --> 23:58.204
Blood cells are marching through
single file.

23:58.237 --> 23:59.572
Timi zero to one flow.

23:59.606 --> 24:01.107
FRANK:
What's that mean?

24:01.140 --> 24:03.510
You are going to give
a 2-B-3-A inhibitor?
You just watch

24:03.543 --> 24:06.078
the pretty pictures
and leave the medicine to me.

24:06.112 --> 24:07.880
( alarm sounds )
P.V.C.'s.

24:07.914 --> 24:09.582
KAYSON:
Another 50 of lido.

24:09.616 --> 24:11.818
What's happening?
Pratt, you are
disturbing

24:11.851 --> 24:14.020
my patient, and you're bugging
the hell out of me.

24:14.053 --> 24:15.254
Why don't you wait outside?

24:15.287 --> 24:17.089
Fine with me.
Take care, big man.

24:18.525 --> 24:20.993
Please... don't go.

24:22.762 --> 24:25.798
Please stay.

24:25.832 --> 24:27.066
Think I'll stay
a few more minutes

24:27.099 --> 24:28.535
if you don't mind,
Dr. Kayson.

24:28.568 --> 24:29.702
I do mind.

24:29.736 --> 24:31.671
Tough.

24:45.084 --> 24:48.087
Wow.
Yeah, wow.

24:48.120 --> 24:50.890
( sighs ):
Well, at least
the E.R.'s slow.

24:50.923 --> 24:53.760
Mm. Closed to trauma,
closed to transfers,

24:53.793 --> 24:55.027
closed to ambulances.

24:55.061 --> 24:57.564
Thank you, Dr. Morris.

24:57.564 --> 24:59.699
Hey, I.R. called
about, uh, Mr. Rojas,

24:59.732 --> 25:01.267
the driver that he hit.

25:01.300 --> 25:03.235
They, uh, embolized
a small retroperitoneal bleeder.

25:03.269 --> 25:05.071
He's going to be fine.
What about his son?

25:05.104 --> 25:07.740
Still in surgery.

25:07.774 --> 25:11.110
I pulled his old charts.

25:11.143 --> 25:13.079
The tank guy.

25:13.112 --> 25:15.748
Back strain, broken finger,
nosebleed,

25:15.782 --> 25:18.084
five psych consults
but no admissions,

25:18.117 --> 25:19.952
distant history of cocaine
and amphetamine abuse.

25:19.986 --> 25:21.320
Probably nothing
that would've convinced

25:21.353 --> 25:22.989
a psych resident
to give him a bed.

25:23.022 --> 25:25.124
He had pressured speech,
paranoia, delusions of grandeur.

25:25.157 --> 25:26.593
Abby...

25:26.593 --> 25:27.694
I missed
a drug-induced psychosis.

25:27.727 --> 25:28.995
Psych saw him five times.

25:29.028 --> 25:31.631
He never met admission criteria.

25:31.664 --> 25:33.600
Don't beat yourself up
over this.

25:33.600 --> 25:36.068
I'm not beating myself up.

25:36.102 --> 25:38.204
The guy came here looking
for help, and I let him go.

25:38.237 --> 25:40.306
That's just what happened.

25:40.339 --> 25:42.141
Dr. Carter.

25:43.810 --> 25:45.077
Dr. Carter.

25:45.111 --> 25:47.246
Sam is looking for you,

25:47.279 --> 25:50.016
and Mrs. Delyanov
has tight wheezing and
her urticaria is back.

25:50.049 --> 25:51.718
She's on alb...
Excuse me, excuse me.

25:51.751 --> 25:53.853
Do either of you work in
the emergency department?

25:53.886 --> 25:55.755
Yeah.
I'm trying to find
my husband.

25:55.788 --> 25:56.923
Uh, what's his name?

25:56.956 --> 25:59.058
Francis Martin.
He works here.

25:59.091 --> 26:02.629
My daddy answers the phones.
He's in charge.

26:02.629 --> 26:03.663
Frank?

26:03.696 --> 26:05.031
Yes, Frank Martin.

26:05.064 --> 26:06.999
Someone just called
and said he was sick.

26:07.033 --> 26:10.036
Um... I'm very sorry.

26:10.069 --> 26:11.638
He had a heart attack.

26:11.638 --> 26:13.139
( gasps ):
Oh, my God.

26:13.172 --> 26:14.874
He's up in the cath lab now.

26:14.907 --> 26:16.242
Oh, my God.

26:16.275 --> 26:18.711
What are they doing
to him?

26:18.745 --> 26:20.112
Um, angioplasty.
It's a procedure

26:20.146 --> 26:21.681
where they take a balloon

26:21.714 --> 26:23.816
and unblock a blocked artery
in the heart.

26:23.850 --> 26:26.052
Uh, the cardiologist
can explain all this to you.

26:26.085 --> 26:27.654
Neela, will you
take them upstairs?

26:27.654 --> 26:32.158
Please, I'll show you
where to wait.

26:32.191 --> 26:34.260
Mr. Taslitz,
can you hear me?
He blinks all the time.

26:34.293 --> 26:35.895
It doesn't mean anything.

26:35.928 --> 26:37.997
His systolic's only 62;
his pO2's even less.

26:38.030 --> 26:41.267
He was satting well
before-- he was alert.

26:41.300 --> 26:44.003
Mr. Taslitz,
I want you to blink twice

26:44.036 --> 26:46.238
if you can hear me.

26:46.272 --> 26:47.373
He's not following
any commands.

26:47.406 --> 26:48.741
I had a connection.

26:48.775 --> 26:50.209
He wants his
suffering to end.

26:50.242 --> 26:52.078
CARTER:
What's up?
You guys need me?

26:52.111 --> 26:54.146
No.
I asked him to come.

26:54.180 --> 26:55.815
He's my patient, Sam.

26:55.848 --> 26:57.750
I just wanted someone
more objective.

26:57.784 --> 26:59.418
( alarm sounds )
SAM:
Pressure's bottoming out.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.187
Down to 40.
I'm not getting a pulse.

27:01.220 --> 27:02.689
It's P.A. What
are we doing?

27:02.689 --> 27:04.223
Starting compressions.
Amp of epi.

27:04.256 --> 27:05.391
This isn't what he wants.

27:05.424 --> 27:06.793
Epi, Sam.

27:11.197 --> 27:13.299
KAYSON:
Guideline's
through the occlusion.

27:13.332 --> 27:15.702
Wonder what's for dinner.

27:15.735 --> 27:19.338
You hungry? That's a good sign.

27:19.371 --> 27:21.841
They used to fly us in
a hot meal

27:21.874 --> 27:23.710
every time
we were in a firefight.

27:23.710 --> 27:25.177
He's looped on the versed.

27:25.211 --> 27:27.146
Let's hear some vitals.

27:27.179 --> 27:29.048
A.C.T's 220.
Pulse 87, resps 24.

27:29.081 --> 27:35.221
Tay Nihn Province, second in
the 22nd, mechanized infantry.

27:35.254 --> 27:39.025
I'd hear those first
enemy rounds: pop, pop, pop.

27:39.058 --> 27:40.827
So you know how
to use a bazooka?

27:40.860 --> 27:42.729
They could use you
outside right now.

27:42.762 --> 27:46.733
It's funny... we were...
that close to dying...

27:46.733 --> 27:51.470
and I'd be thinking... 'I wonder
if it's beef stew tonight.'

27:51.503 --> 27:53.172
You're not dying, Frank.

27:53.205 --> 27:55.842
BLAKE:
Vessel's pretty angulated.
Want a shorter stent?

27:55.875 --> 27:57.910
KAYSON:
No, it has to cover
the lesion if we're
going to prevent

27:57.944 --> 27:59.211
acute re-occlusion.

27:59.245 --> 28:01.748
I can wiggle it in there.

28:01.781 --> 28:03.750
Half of my unit was black.

28:03.783 --> 28:07.086
They were all cocky S.O.B.'s,
just like you.

28:07.119 --> 28:09.221
Some of your best friends, huh?

28:09.255 --> 28:13.392
Yeah. Shanks...

28:13.425 --> 28:19.899
He was shot right through the
left eye... February 12, 1967.

28:19.932 --> 28:22.234
Davis...

28:22.268 --> 28:27.874
Bauer... Woodward...

28:27.907 --> 28:30.943
None of 'em made it.

28:31.778 --> 28:33.245
None of 'em.

28:33.279 --> 28:34.847
KAYSON:
All right, that
looks good.

28:34.881 --> 28:38.050
Inflate to 15
atmospheres.

28:38.084 --> 28:40.286
You know what you are, buddy?

28:42.054 --> 28:47.093
You were what those boys
could've been.

28:49.295 --> 28:50.997
( alarm sounds )

28:51.030 --> 28:52.264
Frank?

28:52.298 --> 28:54.066
Frank? He's out.

28:54.100 --> 28:56.302
Inject contrast.

28:56.335 --> 28:59.806
Pulse is up to 125.
Pressure's dropping, sats 85.

28:59.839 --> 29:01.941
He's perfed. He's bleeding
into his pericardium.

29:01.974 --> 29:04.176
KAYSON:
Give me a covered stent, now.

29:04.210 --> 29:05.511
Pressure's 65/0.

29:05.544 --> 29:07.379
He's maxed out on
dopamine and levophed.

29:07.413 --> 29:09.115
Still no pulse.
How much longer
are we going, Deb?

29:09.148 --> 29:10.449
Okay. Holding compressions.

29:10.482 --> 29:12.318
No!
SAM:
V-tach.

29:12.351 --> 29:13.519
Charge to 200.

29:13.552 --> 29:15.054
Do it. Shock him.

29:15.087 --> 29:16.488
CHEN:
Clear.

29:19.025 --> 29:21.060
No change. You're torturing
the guy.

29:21.093 --> 29:22.328
Keep going, please.

29:22.361 --> 29:23.462
Charge to 300.

29:23.495 --> 29:25.231
CARTER:
Last time.
Clear.

29:26.332 --> 29:27.834
( alarm silences )

29:27.834 --> 29:29.468
Sinus tach.

29:29.501 --> 29:31.337
Got your father's heart beating
in a normal rhythm

29:31.370 --> 29:32.839
again, but he's going to have
to have medicine

29:32.839 --> 29:34.506
to keep him from having
another arrhythmia.

29:34.540 --> 29:37.977
Don't stop. Don't stop.

29:38.010 --> 29:40.079
His heart is beating.

29:45.151 --> 29:46.886
KAYSON:
Run a liter of saline
wide open.

29:46.919 --> 29:48.520
Oh, Lord, another one--
can't you people stay

29:48.554 --> 29:50.556
down in the E.R.?
His family's here.
What happened?

29:50.589 --> 29:52.358
The artery is so calcified,
the stent cracked it.

29:52.391 --> 29:53.492
Muffled heart sounds.

29:53.525 --> 29:55.061
Tamponade.

29:55.094 --> 29:56.195
PRATT:
Heart's surrounded
by pressurized blood.

29:56.228 --> 29:57.463
It needs to be drained.

29:57.496 --> 29:59.165
All right, run
dobutamine at 10 mikes

29:59.198 --> 30:00.566
Prep for pericardiocentesis.

30:00.599 --> 30:01.834
I'll get it.

30:01.868 --> 30:03.269
PRATT:
Needle to me.

30:03.302 --> 30:05.237
You, stop.

30:05.271 --> 30:06.873
This is not the E.R.

30:06.906 --> 30:07.539
We do things a little
more controlled

30:07.573 --> 30:09.275
up here.
Let me help.

30:09.308 --> 30:10.509
( alarm sounds )
Pressure's dropping, 80/45.

30:10.542 --> 30:11.878
We have to up
his cardiac output.

30:11.911 --> 30:13.179
I'll have the stent in
in 90 seconds.

30:13.212 --> 30:14.513
He doesn't have 90 seconds.

30:14.546 --> 30:17.016
Systolic's down to 71.
I can draw off 50cc's.

30:17.049 --> 30:18.250
That'll buy us some time.

30:18.284 --> 30:20.386
Dr. Kayson?

30:20.419 --> 30:22.121
Just don't lacerate
another coronary.

30:22.154 --> 30:25.491
( alarm sounds )
All right. Okay.

30:27.193 --> 30:29.628
Ah, yeah.

30:29.661 --> 30:31.063
P.V.C.'s.

30:31.097 --> 30:32.464
Now you're putting him
into v-tach.

30:32.498 --> 30:34.100
Okay, once you get ectopy
on the monitor,

30:34.133 --> 30:37.236
you just...
pull back a little, uh...

30:37.269 --> 30:38.470
like magic.

30:38.504 --> 30:40.139
BLAKE:
BP's coming up, 98/60.

30:40.172 --> 30:42.408
Almost 30cc's of blood out.

30:42.441 --> 30:43.609
BLAKE:
O.R. Four is ready.

30:43.642 --> 30:45.011
All right, let's roll.

30:45.044 --> 30:46.012
One lucky needle
doesn't make you

30:46.045 --> 30:47.379
a cardiologist, Pratt.

30:49.648 --> 30:51.317
Where is he?

30:51.350 --> 30:53.285
On Ashland.

30:53.319 --> 30:55.922
It's the only way
he can come-- the
roads are all blocked.

30:59.091 --> 31:02.962
They'll stop him.
They will.

31:42.568 --> 31:46.138
He can't go past
the snowplows.

31:49.241 --> 31:50.642
Now they can throw his ass
in jail.

31:50.676 --> 31:53.179
What he needs is an eval
and a psych admission.

31:53.212 --> 31:54.446
What kind of eval
does he need?

31:54.480 --> 31:57.183
"Have you ever stalled a tank?"

32:16.335 --> 32:18.437
Oh, God.

32:33.252 --> 32:34.553
41-year-old male,
three GSWs.

32:34.586 --> 32:36.122
Where was he hit?

32:36.155 --> 32:39.291
Chest, neck, shoulder.
BP 108/72, tachy at 112.

32:39.325 --> 32:41.460
Arterial bleeder.
I need more gauze.

32:41.493 --> 32:42.728
Deep breaths, Mr. Welling.

32:42.761 --> 32:45.131
I said I was coming back.

32:45.164 --> 32:46.465
Can't get
a radial pulse.

32:46.498 --> 32:47.566
You know,
he's not going anywhere.

32:47.599 --> 32:48.767
Cuffs stay put.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.236
Mr. Welling?

32:50.269 --> 32:51.570
He needs intubation,
a chest tube, and 0-neg.

32:51.603 --> 32:54.106
Morris, get your ass
over here!

32:54.140 --> 32:55.507
BP 78/56.

32:55.541 --> 32:56.542
Hang two units on
the rapid infuser.

32:56.575 --> 32:57.509
He's hard to bag.

32:57.543 --> 32:58.644
I can't get a good seal

32:58.677 --> 33:00.179
with all this blood.
I need suction.

33:00.212 --> 33:01.247
All right, two
more breaths,

33:01.280 --> 33:02.314
then he gets tubed.

33:02.348 --> 33:03.149
Sats are falling,
down to 86.

33:03.182 --> 33:04.383
Let me tube him.

33:04.416 --> 33:05.517
I've got this.
Come on, everybody,

33:05.551 --> 33:06.552
let's push some
SUCCS, huh?

33:06.585 --> 33:08.354
Crichoid pressure?

33:08.387 --> 33:09.288
Yep.
Easy, Morris.

33:09.321 --> 33:10.289
He has a GSW
to the neck.

33:10.322 --> 33:11.557
BP's falling down with his sats.

33:11.590 --> 33:12.591
Oh, there's a lot
of blood in there.

33:12.624 --> 33:13.692
Okay, Yankauer.

33:13.725 --> 33:15.294
Got it.

33:17.429 --> 33:21.167
Okay, I am in.
Bag him up.

33:21.200 --> 33:22.401
Good breath sounds

33:22.434 --> 33:23.702
on the right.
Sats are only 68.

33:23.735 --> 33:25.171
They're not coming up.

33:25.204 --> 33:26.205
He might have a
pneumo on the left.

33:26.238 --> 33:27.239
Prep for a chest tube.

33:27.273 --> 33:28.274
I'll do the chest tube.

33:28.307 --> 33:29.341
No. Carter,

33:29.375 --> 33:30.309
he's not doing it.

33:30.342 --> 33:31.477
He was my patient!

33:31.510 --> 33:32.511
Yeah, he was,
and look what happened.

33:32.544 --> 33:33.679
Morris is up.

33:33.712 --> 33:35.314
Okay, Chuny, set him up
with betadine.

33:35.347 --> 33:36.682
Betadine, and a ten blade,
please.

33:36.715 --> 33:38.450
Heart rate's only 48.

33:38.484 --> 33:40.386
All right, Morris,
fifth intercostal space.

33:40.419 --> 33:42.121
In the mid-axillary line,
I know.

33:42.154 --> 33:43.455
That's right.

33:44.790 --> 33:47.093
Blunt dissection,
stay superior to the rib.

33:47.093 --> 33:48.160
I've got it.

33:49.528 --> 33:51.330
32 French on a curved
vascular next.

33:51.363 --> 33:53.765
Run of six.

33:57.169 --> 33:58.170
( grunts )

33:58.204 --> 33:59.205
I can't get it in.

33:59.238 --> 34:00.239
I'm losing the pulse.

34:00.272 --> 34:01.340
Carter?

34:01.373 --> 34:02.641
He's got it.

34:02.674 --> 34:04.576
Keep your finger
in the tract.
Chuny, open

34:04.610 --> 34:06.145
the crash cart.

34:06.178 --> 34:07.279
Stand by to start
compressions.

34:07.313 --> 34:09.547
No. I'm in.

34:09.581 --> 34:10.649
Hook up the thoraseal.

34:10.681 --> 34:11.650
Right.

34:11.683 --> 34:12.684
Sats are coming up.

34:12.717 --> 34:13.752
That's nice work, Morris.

34:13.784 --> 34:14.853
Okay, hang two more units,

34:14.886 --> 34:16.688
let's get him to the OR.

34:16.722 --> 34:18.257
Strong carotid,
good breath sounds.

34:18.290 --> 34:19.425
BP's up to 60 systolic.

34:19.458 --> 34:21.127
Kick the brake.
Are we clear?

34:21.127 --> 34:22.661
Can I scrub in?
Nope.

34:26.264 --> 34:27.565
He's going to be okay.

34:27.599 --> 34:28.766
We saved him.

34:35.741 --> 34:37.409
Luka?

34:37.443 --> 34:39.411
Joanne's admitting one
of Brian's friends.

34:39.445 --> 34:41.246
PID?

34:41.280 --> 34:43.614
Upper-tract chlamydia with a
huge tubo-ovarian abscess.

34:43.649 --> 34:45.150
They'll try
antibiotics.

34:45.184 --> 34:46.784
I hope she doesn't
need surgery.

34:46.818 --> 34:49.455
She could lose a tube.

34:49.487 --> 34:51.422
Fun.

34:54.159 --> 34:55.827
Going home?

34:55.860 --> 34:59.265
Another hour.

34:59.298 --> 35:00.766
Do you want to get some coffee?

35:03.269 --> 35:04.603
I'll wait.

35:09.175 --> 35:10.442
No, thanks.

35:16.382 --> 35:17.416
Hi.

35:17.449 --> 35:19.385
Hey.

35:21.587 --> 35:22.588
Are you ready?

35:22.621 --> 35:23.655
Yeah.

35:23.689 --> 35:25.191
Okay. Let's go.

35:36.468 --> 35:39.205
Oh. Thank you.

35:41.273 --> 35:44.376
It's very kind of you
to sit with us.

35:45.911 --> 35:47.946
You know, it was always
my worst nightmare

35:47.979 --> 35:50.716
when Frank was on
the police force...

35:50.749 --> 35:54.820
that I'd get some call
from the hospital.

35:54.853 --> 35:59.391
You can't ever stop
worrying, can you?

35:59.425 --> 36:02.228
Dr. Pratt will find us
when he has any news.

36:08.867 --> 36:12.738
You know, Frank took this job
because he wanted

36:12.771 --> 36:15.474
to put more money away
for Janie.

36:15.507 --> 36:19.711
That's all he ever
thinks about is his Janie.

36:19.745 --> 36:22.881
I'm sure he talks about her
all the time.

36:22.914 --> 36:24.683
Yes.

36:28.520 --> 36:34.426
But he loves it here, comes home
with stories all the time.

36:34.460 --> 36:38.397
He always makes the work
day very interesting.

36:38.430 --> 36:41.333
You're Neela Rasgotra, right?

36:41.367 --> 36:42.934
Mm-hmm.

36:44.970 --> 36:50.442
Frank always says
how bright you are...

36:50.476 --> 36:52.644
and how well you're doing.

36:52.678 --> 36:54.913
( crying )

36:54.946 --> 36:56.815
That's very kind.

37:01.653 --> 37:03.955
Yeah.

37:03.989 --> 37:07.293
Frank's always been
a people person.

37:19.004 --> 37:23.775
They should be taking him up
to the ICU in about an hour.

37:23.809 --> 37:26.578
He won't open
his eyes anymore.

37:26.612 --> 37:31.883
Uh... he might
have suffered
more brain damage

37:31.917 --> 37:33.952
when he wasn't
getting oxygen.

37:36.021 --> 37:37.989
After he gets out
of the hospital,

37:38.023 --> 37:40.826
it's gonna be hard to
take care of him at home.

37:40.859 --> 37:44.463
We can help you
find a good long-
term facility.

37:46.031 --> 37:47.499
Dahlia...

37:54.406 --> 37:57.809
Do you think people get
what they deserve?

37:57.843 --> 38:00.679
No, not really.

38:04.950 --> 38:09.087
I was 17 when he got hurt.

38:09.120 --> 38:13.024
Tim Landau called
from the floor of the shop.

38:13.058 --> 38:15.026
I thought it was Dad calling

38:15.060 --> 38:18.364
to see if I was home
from school.

38:18.397 --> 38:21.567
He called every day
since the fifth grade.

38:24.636 --> 38:29.841
He wanted me to be there
when he got home...

38:29.875 --> 38:33.111
because my stepmom would still
be at the restaurant.

38:33.144 --> 38:37.649
So we'd be alone.

38:37.683 --> 38:40.118
You and your dad?

38:40.151 --> 38:45.491
I'd take a shower,
and wait in my room.

38:45.524 --> 38:48.394
He liked it
when I left my hair wet.

38:55.567 --> 38:57.669
We can go to Beat Kitchen
or Liquid.

38:57.703 --> 38:59.004
I heard it's very hip.

38:59.037 --> 39:00.839
Dancing?

39:00.872 --> 39:03.942
You want to just go home?

39:03.975 --> 39:05.544
We can dance there.

39:16.455 --> 39:18.657
You don't want to dance.

39:20.158 --> 39:21.560
Gillian...

39:21.593 --> 39:23.829
Are you in love
with her?

39:23.862 --> 39:25.731
The nurse?

39:32.971 --> 39:37.576
You know, I'm jealous.

39:37.609 --> 39:40.679
I don't have any
right to be, but...

39:40.712 --> 39:42.448
yeah.

39:47.152 --> 39:49.455
A bientot.

39:50.789 --> 39:53.459
Je t'embrasse.

40:10.175 --> 40:12.778
PRATT:
You're okay.

40:12.811 --> 40:15.814
We had to open up your chest
to bypass the blockage.

40:15.847 --> 40:20.886
So, no more nachos,
no more perogies.

40:20.919 --> 40:25.090
Remember, today is the first day
of the rest of your life, Frank.

40:25.123 --> 40:29.060
I'm in hell, right?

40:29.094 --> 40:31.630
You killed me.

40:31.663 --> 40:33.499
You and your...

40:33.532 --> 40:36.067
faithful Indian companion.

40:38.236 --> 40:40.906
Daddy?

40:40.939 --> 40:42.941
Daddy...

40:42.974 --> 40:44.843
( groans )

40:44.876 --> 40:47.145
I wasn't scared,
I wasn't.

40:47.178 --> 40:51.016
That's my good girl.

40:51.049 --> 40:52.450
( groans )

40:53.084 --> 40:54.820
You're my...

40:54.853 --> 40:58.123
my brave girl.

41:00.659 --> 41:02.794
Hard to believe he was
an officer.

41:02.828 --> 41:04.696
And a husband
and a dad.

41:04.730 --> 41:06.264
And a bigot.

41:06.297 --> 41:07.866
That, too.

41:09.535 --> 41:10.902
Bypass went well?

41:10.936 --> 41:13.539
Yeah, less than 30 minutes
of pump time.

41:13.572 --> 41:15.641
Kayson says you're banned
from the cath lab.

41:15.674 --> 41:17.543
Nice work, you two.

41:17.576 --> 41:19.244
Dr. Corday, they
need you in OR 1.

41:19.277 --> 41:21.547
I'm already late for dinner.

41:21.547 --> 41:23.148
They said it was 911.

41:27.218 --> 41:28.687
ALEX:
So the guy's head comes off

41:28.720 --> 41:30.722
and then these
spider legs grow out.

41:30.756 --> 41:32.023
It's really cool.

41:32.057 --> 41:33.792
You should probably
close your eyes.

41:33.825 --> 41:35.627
Luka!

41:36.327 --> 41:37.929
KOVAC:
Hey.

41:37.963 --> 41:39.898
We rented The Thing
and Evil Dead II.

41:39.931 --> 41:40.932
Have you seen them?

41:40.966 --> 41:42.067
Nope.

41:42.100 --> 41:43.569
Well, Mom got me
McDonald's,

41:43.569 --> 41:44.970
but you could probably
order a pizza.

41:45.003 --> 41:47.072
Alex, why don't you
head upstairs?

41:47.105 --> 41:48.974
Isn't Luka
coming up?

41:49.007 --> 41:50.576
Put the popcorn on--

41:50.576 --> 41:52.611
two and a half minutes on high,
okay?

41:58.049 --> 41:59.618
It's cold.

41:59.651 --> 42:01.587
They said it was
going to snow.

42:01.620 --> 42:04.590
Luka, I'm tired.

42:05.691 --> 42:08.594
Gillian went to a hotel.

42:08.594 --> 42:10.662
She was at your apartment
last night, wasn't she?

42:10.696 --> 42:12.931
When I came by.

42:12.964 --> 42:15.066
Yeah.

42:15.100 --> 42:16.668
You talked to me
and closed the door,

42:16.702 --> 42:22.608
and, like, five minutes later...

42:22.608 --> 42:24.109
I was probably
still on the stairs.

42:26.011 --> 42:28.113
I'm sorry.

42:29.615 --> 42:32.784
God, I am so stupid.

42:34.620 --> 42:35.887
I really...

42:38.123 --> 42:40.025
Whatever.

42:43.795 --> 42:45.997
You came here to say something,
so say it.

42:46.031 --> 42:47.833
It's freezing outside.

42:49.200 --> 42:51.369
I screwed up.

42:51.402 --> 42:55.641
I just wanted to apologize.

42:55.641 --> 42:56.675
Okay.

42:57.809 --> 42:59.310
Sam...

43:04.883 --> 43:07.152
Just tell Alex I said...

43:12.123 --> 43:15.927
Just tell him I'm sorry
I couldn't stay.

43:15.961 --> 43:17.295
Sure.

43:34.379 --> 43:35.914
Hey!

43:39.450 --> 43:42.187
These movies scare the crap
out of me.
