00:01.544 --> 00:03.754
<i>Previously on</i>
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D....

00:06.507 --> 00:07.466
What are you?

00:07.633 --> 00:10.845
This woman caused the disturbance
in Chen and his people with a touch?

00:11.012 --> 00:13.764
<i>Yeah, it seems to have something
to do with physical contact.</i>

00:13.931 --> 00:15.307
Get away from me!

00:15.474 --> 00:17.601
What treatment are you implementing?
How long will...

00:17.768 --> 00:19.103
Hey, hey. I'm sorry, that's classified.

00:19.270 --> 00:21.022
<i>Some of our
medication supply is missing.</i>

00:21.188 --> 00:22.064
It's Yo-Yo.

00:22.231 --> 00:25.609
She's stealing it and you two
have been in touch this whole time.

00:25.776 --> 00:27.236
<i>There's a group
called the Watchdogs.</i>

00:27.820 --> 00:30.197
<i>They're hunting Inhumans and who knows
what kind of weapon they stole</i>

00:30.281 --> 00:31.741
<i>from the energy lab in Pasadena.</i>

00:32.073 --> 00:35.077
You want to know what's connecting
these things? I think it might be me.

00:58.768 --> 00:59.810
Now you see it...

01:02.021 --> 01:04.272
now you don't.

01:07.735 --> 01:09.695
How did you do that?

01:09.862 --> 01:11.363
I was born with a gift.

01:11.697 --> 01:14.950
Well, can you magically turn
Elena's clothes into a pretty dress?

01:16.786 --> 01:18.579
- How long have you known me?
- I know.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.790
Ten years. When have you seen me
wearing a dress?

01:20.956 --> 01:22.083
Yeah, I know. Never...

01:22.249 --> 01:25.795
I just thought L.A. would liven up
your fashion sense.

01:25.961 --> 01:28.881
You do know, you have to wear
a bridesmaid's dress at the wedding.

01:29.048 --> 01:30.424
I know, I know.

01:33.302 --> 01:34.804
He's just a friend I work with.

01:34.970 --> 01:36.972
The kind of friend
you'll be bringing to the wedding?

01:37.139 --> 01:38.766
No, Maria, not that kind of friend.

01:39.058 --> 01:41.560
- Then I'll invite him.
- Maria, Maria.

01:43.354 --> 01:44.563
<i>- Yo-Yo.</i>
- Maria!

01:44.855 --> 01:46.190
<i>- I can't hear you.</i>
- Yo-Yo.

01:46.649 --> 01:48.275
<i>Where are you,
Yo-Yo, are you...</i>

02:00.246 --> 02:02.957
It's a blackout.
How cool is that, huh?

02:03.624 --> 02:07.169
This is really bad.
No more blended drinks.

02:07.336 --> 02:09.130
You guys...

02:26.689 --> 02:28.774
<i>Do we have your attention now?</i>

02:29.108 --> 02:31.152
<i>The blackout in Miami
was just the first.</i>

02:31.402 --> 02:32.820
<i>We will continue to attack you.</i>

02:32.987 --> 02:36.824
<i>City by city, hour by hour
until our voices are heard.</i>

02:36.991 --> 02:39.034
<i>We are the Inhuman resistance</i>

02:39.201 --> 02:43.205
<i>and we will no longer allow our kind
to be treated as freaks and criminals</i>

02:43.873 --> 02:46.625
<i>unless the governments
of the world end registration</i>

02:46.792 --> 02:50.588
<i>and allow us to live in peace,
we will use our powers to fight you.</i>

02:53.048 --> 02:54.091
Damn it.

02:54.592 --> 02:57.303
Is this some lone nut-job
or are the Inhumans really organising?

02:57.469 --> 02:59.221
We have no real information, sir.

02:59.388 --> 03:00.848
The broadcast was untraceable.

03:01.015 --> 03:02.308
It's quite sophisticated, really,

03:02.474 --> 03:06.478
which rules out
both "lone" and "nut-job."

03:06.645 --> 03:10.858
And the blackout was it caused
by an Inhuman powers or sabotage?

03:11.025 --> 03:14.445
There was only one Inhuman capable
of short-circuiting an entire city.

03:14.612 --> 03:16.155
Lincoln Campbell,
he was one of the good guys.

03:16.322 --> 03:18.949
I know and we owe him a great debt.
There's no one else with his powers?

03:19.116 --> 03:20.284
Could be one we haven't found.

03:20.451 --> 03:21.869
Yeah,
but it's most likely an EMP device.

03:22.036 --> 03:23.787
So the threat was credible.
They could blackout more cities?

03:23.954 --> 03:25.372
Yeah, if there's more than one EMP device,

03:25.539 --> 03:27.208
- it's more than credible.
- This is a PR nightmare.

03:27.333 --> 03:29.376
We're only a month away from
reintroducing S.H.I.E.L.D. to the public.

03:29.460 --> 03:32.213
People's lives could be at stake.
You're worried about bad publicity?

03:32.379 --> 03:33.380
Who the hell are you anyway?

03:33.547 --> 03:37.509
That's Burrows from Public Relations.
It's his job to worry about bad publicity.

03:37.718 --> 03:41.096
- So let's just take a beat...
- calm down.

03:42.348 --> 03:45.267
"A team divided
is a team defeated." Right? Right?

03:46.644 --> 03:49.480
We have an Inhuman asset in Miami.
Elena Rodriguez.

03:49.730 --> 03:52.733
I lost contact with her an hour ago,
now if this thing escalates...

03:52.900 --> 03:54.693
Then we have to de-escalate it, pronto.

03:55.361 --> 03:58.155
I want you two and Phil in the air
and on the way to Miami within the hour.

03:58.447 --> 04:01.575
Well, you need to be the one
to give him that order.

04:02.493 --> 04:04.119
He wasn't too happy
with the last one.

04:04.286 --> 04:05.996
- Please, I need to speak
- Come on, May.

04:06.163 --> 04:07.957
- with someone about Agent May's care.
- Fight this.

04:08.123 --> 04:10.417
Actually, I have a remote feed
from your facility.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.670
I'm looking at her vitals right now

04:12.836 --> 04:15.214
and she is clearly not stabilising.

04:15.464 --> 04:17.298
Her heart rate is erratic,

04:17.466 --> 04:20.636
her blood pressure is continuing
to rise, adrenaline's spiking.

04:20.970 --> 04:23.055
Who is in charge over there?

04:23.472 --> 04:24.765
Does anyone know what the hell the...

04:25.641 --> 04:28.018
Hello? Hello?

04:31.230 --> 04:33.899
They hung up, they're clueless.

04:34.149 --> 04:37.569
Not that I have a solution
without actually getting inside her brain.

04:37.736 --> 04:39.738
Where is she?
Who the hell is treating her?

04:41.532 --> 04:43.534
I'm so sorry, but it's classified.

04:43.909 --> 04:45.577
Without the Director's permission,
I can't...

04:45.744 --> 04:47.329
She's in upstate New York.

04:48.080 --> 04:50.708
Agent May is at one of the best
CDC facilities in the country.

04:51.292 --> 04:53.544
Why keep that from me?
I could be there now.

04:53.711 --> 04:54.837
And would be.

04:55.004 --> 04:56.797
I know how much you like
to make unauthorised trips,

04:56.964 --> 04:59.216
but I needed you here in case of a crisis
and now there's a crisi...

05:01.135 --> 05:02.845
Hold him down, hold him down.

05:04.305 --> 05:05.723
- It's okay.
- Get away from me!

05:05.889 --> 05:07.224
Heart rate's erratic.

05:13.188 --> 05:14.189
He's gone.

05:15.816 --> 05:16.984
What just happened?

05:18.652 --> 05:21.363
Exactly what's going to happen to May
within the next 24 hours.

05:21.905 --> 05:23.240
The CDC is at a dead end

05:23.407 --> 05:25.576
unless we take some kind
of drastic measure...

05:26.744 --> 05:27.745
we'll lose her.

05:29.163 --> 05:30.372
Do you have something in mind?

05:31.290 --> 05:34.626
It's a long shot, but yes.
Maybe there might be someone who...

05:34.877 --> 05:36.879
Whatever you need,
make it happen.

05:38.714 --> 05:40.507
- Nathanson! I need May's latest vitals...
- I'm going with her.

05:40.591 --> 05:41.592
Negative.

05:42.176 --> 05:43.302
You're going to Miami.

05:43.469 --> 05:45.804
You're the best agent I have
to deal with the Inhumans.

05:45.971 --> 05:47.931
If this blackout is legitimate
and there are more to come,

05:48.098 --> 05:50.392
we could have a huge international
problem on our hands.

05:51.977 --> 05:54.063
It's the call you'd make
if you were in my shoes.

06:11.372 --> 06:14.833
My poor fiancÃ© is out there somewhere
and I have no way to reach him.

06:15.084 --> 06:17.336
How does a blackout kill your phone?

06:17.795 --> 06:19.588
It was probably an EMP.

06:29.348 --> 06:31.058
Word from downstairs
is that we're under attack.

06:31.225 --> 06:33.018
Inhumans caused the blackout
and people are starting to riot.

06:33.185 --> 06:35.396
- We got to go.
- No, no, no. We're safer up here.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.147
No, we're trapped up here.

06:37.314 --> 06:38.690
We got to get
to some place with power.

06:39.024 --> 06:40.609
I'm going. I need to find Sammy.

06:42.778 --> 06:43.904
We can't let her go alone.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.824
Thirty flights of stairs?
In heels? Really?

06:46.990 --> 06:48.200
That's why I don't wear them.

06:52.162 --> 06:53.455
Where are we going?

06:54.832 --> 06:57.126
Look, I know you're doing
this whole mysterious, silent thing

06:57.376 --> 06:59.795
but if we're going to work together
on this, you've got to fill me in.

07:03.424 --> 07:05.676
You know someone that worked
at that Momentum facility?

07:06.427 --> 07:07.469
My uncle.

07:09.721 --> 07:10.889
We're going to go see him.

07:12.433 --> 07:13.434
Uncle?

07:14.560 --> 07:16.061
Uncle Elias Morrow?

07:16.937 --> 07:19.064
Doing time
at South Ridge Penitentiary?

07:22.568 --> 07:25.779
I like to vet my vengeance demons
before I hop in a car with them.

07:27.239 --> 07:30.117
He's a good man
and he did a bad thing.

07:30.284 --> 07:32.244
Attempted manslaughter, yeah,
I'd say so.

07:32.870 --> 07:34.163
What did he do at that lab?

07:34.746 --> 07:36.123
He was an electrical engineer.

07:36.707 --> 07:38.083
His work was way above my head,

07:38.250 --> 07:39.877
but I think it's time we figure it out.

07:40.002 --> 07:41.211
<i>...suspect at large.</i>

07:41.295 --> 07:43.964
<i>We now have two confirmed blackouts,
Miami and London.</i>

07:44.131 --> 07:45.507
<i>The Inhumans claiming responsibility</i>

07:45.799 --> 07:48.218
<i>threatened to black out
a major city every hour</i>

07:48.385 --> 07:50.262
<i>if their demands are not...</i>

07:50.804 --> 07:53.390
- You hear that?
- I don't believe it.

07:54.516 --> 07:57.394
- I hope they don't hit L.A.
- You afraid of the dark?

07:57.686 --> 07:59.104
No. My little brother rides
the metro.

07:59.271 --> 08:01.148
He's going to be stuck
in a bad part of town.

08:01.899 --> 08:03.525
You know what happens
to people during a blackout,

08:03.692 --> 08:05.277
they think they can get away
with whatever they want.

08:05.444 --> 08:07.070
That nothing can stop them.

08:08.197 --> 08:09.948
So we're going to have
our hands full if it ha...

08:15.579 --> 08:16.830
What's going on?

08:21.752 --> 08:22.836
If it happens here.

08:26.715 --> 08:30.677
Plug the F-one EEG cables
and the ISO-GND cables into the mini-MEG

08:30.844 --> 08:32.846
and initiate the CBR sequence,
quickly.

08:36.058 --> 08:37.058
Aida?

08:37.226 --> 08:39.520
I'm searching the encyclopaedia
for the acronym references.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.145
Right. Take the red cables
and the green cables,

08:41.313 --> 08:43.982
put them into the back of the black box
and push all the little buttons!

08:47.528 --> 08:48.904
Sorry if I'm being a snappy cat.

08:49.571 --> 08:51.406
I've just been caught
a little bit unprepared, that's all.

08:51.573 --> 08:53.742
They say Agent May is very ill
and it doesn't look good.

08:55.452 --> 08:56.995
Define "snappy cat."

08:57.162 --> 09:00.249
It's... not worth defining.

09:00.958 --> 09:03.627
You should probably never use that.
I should probably never use that.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.047
Done.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.216
Unfortunately, that means I'm going
to have to put you to sleep.

09:09.383 --> 09:10.676
I understand.

09:17.391 --> 09:18.809
You've been so helpful.

09:19.268 --> 09:21.019
I really hate to do this.

09:21.186 --> 09:23.272
But you're not quite ready
for what's coming.

09:24.565 --> 09:25.649
S.H.I.E.L.D. are on their way.

09:25.816 --> 09:28.735
I'll do all I can to help,
I hope I can.

09:28.902 --> 09:31.863
Perhaps then,
we won't have to hide you away.

09:32.364 --> 09:33.574
They're here.

09:46.295 --> 09:48.422
Stay away from me!

09:48.589 --> 09:50.340
- Hold her down.
- No! I know what you are!

09:50.507 --> 09:51.842
It's okay.

09:52.009 --> 09:53.135
Get away from me.

09:53.302 --> 09:56.346
- Okay, hold her down.
- Let go of me! Get away!

10:06.773 --> 10:08.775
Have you determined
whether it's chemical, biological?

10:08.942 --> 10:10.777
We've eliminated
every probable cause.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.904
Unless you want
to consider Mack's theory.

10:13.071 --> 10:13.989
Which is?

10:14.615 --> 10:17.576
- She was touched by a ghost.
- A ghost?

10:17.743 --> 10:20.162
It was definitely something
of an incorporeal nature.

10:20.454 --> 10:21.747
When you eliminate the improbable...

10:21.913 --> 10:23.165
Then you've got to consider
the impossible.

10:23.332 --> 10:25.375
I'm thinking if we use
the transcranial head apparatus

10:25.542 --> 10:27.711
you recently developed, maybe we could
find some sort of clue that...

10:27.878 --> 10:29.379
Well, with both our big brains
examining hers,

10:29.546 --> 10:30.714
I'm sure we'll find a solution.

10:32.007 --> 10:33.550
Any idea how much time we have?

10:33.884 --> 10:36.303
Based on the other cases
we've observed, I'd say...

10:37.596 --> 10:39.431
less than six hours
until certain death.

10:44.770 --> 10:46.855
<i>It was only a matter of time
before this happened.</i>

10:47.564 --> 10:50.484
<i>We can no longer pretend
like the Inhuman threat doesn't exist.</i>

10:50.651 --> 10:52.819
<i>Each and every one of them
is a lethal weapon.</i>

10:52.986 --> 10:55.364
<i>And now those weapons
are aimed directly at us.</i>

10:55.530 --> 10:58.325
<i>Make no mistake,
this is an act of war.</i>

10:58.492 --> 11:00.869
<i>Unless we take a stand
and fight back now while we can,</i>

11:01.036 --> 11:03.038
<i>we will be complicit
in our own extinction.</i>

11:05.040 --> 11:07.084
May as well start handing out
the pitchforks and torches.

11:07.542 --> 11:09.252
Four cities blacked out
in five hours.

11:09.419 --> 11:12.005
London, Los Angeles, Moscow, Miami.
You know what they have in common?

11:12.172 --> 11:13.757
Yeah, we relocated Inhumans
to all of them,

11:13.924 --> 11:16.677
but do you think this is for real?
They're organising an uprising?

11:16.843 --> 11:17.969
Doesn't look good.

11:18.637 --> 11:19.888
But it also doesn't feel right.

11:20.055 --> 11:22.307
Whoever it is, we'll flush them out
when we turn Miami back on.

11:22.474 --> 11:24.351
They're definitely using EMP
devices.

11:25.811 --> 11:26.812
The blackout zone encompasses

11:26.978 --> 11:28.480
the same amount of area
in all four cities.

11:28.647 --> 11:30.941
Now, the effect is randomly dispersed
making it difficult

11:31.108 --> 11:34.611
to pinpoint the source, but I have
everything I need right here to locate it,

11:34.778 --> 11:36.154
to disable it and trace it back...

11:36.321 --> 11:37.656
Trace it back
to whoever is responsible.

11:37.823 --> 11:39.658
Exactly. So it should be quick
and easy.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.661
It better be.
It's getting bad out there.

12:01.346 --> 12:02.723
Every other vehicle's dead.

12:04.099 --> 12:05.767
Phone's dead, too.

12:06.351 --> 12:09.563
You're lucky this car is pre-1980,
no electronics.

12:11.273 --> 12:12.941
The Inhumans would never do this.

12:13.108 --> 12:14.609
Well, isn't that what you are?

12:15.026 --> 12:16.820
It only takes one
to start a revolution.

12:20.157 --> 12:23.285
Calm down before you go
all carrot-top again.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.495
Stress has nothing to do with it.

12:25.662 --> 12:26.955
What exactly is "it"?

12:27.164 --> 12:30.459
Because I still don't buy
the whole "sold my soul" story.

12:30.625 --> 12:32.043
Well, I don't give a damn
what you buy.

12:32.502 --> 12:33.754
I'm the one stuck with it.

12:36.298 --> 12:37.549
So you want to get rid of it?

12:42.095 --> 12:43.930
I thought that
if I settled the score,

12:44.097 --> 12:46.558
took down the gang-bangers
that put Gabe in a wheelchair,

12:46.725 --> 12:48.143
it would go away. Didn't happen.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.313
So I started settling
other people's scores.

12:51.938 --> 12:53.356
The X's on the mural.

12:53.523 --> 12:55.192
When that didn't work either,

12:56.276 --> 12:57.694
I figured if I settled
my uncle's score...

12:57.861 --> 12:59.029
Your uncle?

12:59.571 --> 13:01.490
Don't think he was the victim
in that situation.

13:02.032 --> 13:04.326
He always said the guy he beat up
was the real criminal.

13:05.160 --> 13:06.495
So you think that if you...

13:06.953 --> 13:09.372
right whatever wrong
your uncle was trying to fix,

13:09.539 --> 13:14.252
that you can get rid of... "it"?

13:15.378 --> 13:17.464
Or else I have to ride with it forever.

13:21.718 --> 13:24.513
Out of the car. Now!

13:27.307 --> 13:28.642
What you looking at, Hot Wheels?

13:30.352 --> 13:33.396
These cars ain't going nowhere.
Maybe we should take his wheels.

13:41.196 --> 13:42.447
Even better.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.869
I wouldn't touch it if I were you.
Owner's a bit of a hothead.

13:48.036 --> 13:49.621
It's a shame to see
something this nice

13:49.788 --> 13:51.790
in the hands of someone
who can't take care of her.

13:51.957 --> 13:54.251
What I'd really like to do
is get a look under the hood.

13:54.417 --> 13:55.585
Hey, hands off.

13:55.752 --> 13:57.170
Just admiring her, homes.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.672
Nothing wrong with that, is there?

14:03.552 --> 14:05.512
- She runs a little hot.
- Get her!

14:43.174 --> 14:44.175
Was...

14:44.843 --> 14:49.180
- Was that "it"?
- No, that was me.

14:51.641 --> 14:53.894
- You good?
- Still standing, you?

14:54.644 --> 14:55.896
Sunshine and rainbows.

14:56.062 --> 14:57.188
You must be Gabe.

14:58.106 --> 14:59.524
Gabe, this is Daisy.

15:00.025 --> 15:01.026
Come on.

15:01.735 --> 15:03.194
Let's get you home
before it gets dark.

15:10.493 --> 15:12.078
I think we should stay here.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.705
Sammy wouldn't want you
going outside

15:13.872 --> 15:15.290
and the power
will be back on soon.

15:15.457 --> 15:16.458
I'm not waiting.

15:18.084 --> 15:19.210
Move back.

15:21.338 --> 15:22.839
Everybody, get back.

15:23.715 --> 15:24.925
You and you, come on!

15:25.008 --> 15:27.218
Stay calm and no one will get hurt.

15:27.969 --> 15:30.597
Take it and I'll be on my way.
Just, I'll be on my...

15:30.764 --> 15:32.390
We're not here for your money.

15:35.268 --> 15:36.394
We're here for the Inhuman.

15:44.152 --> 15:46.529
The framework could create
a nice, pastoral scene to help her relax,

15:46.613 --> 15:48.448
but who knows what her brain
will make of it now.

15:48.531 --> 15:50.575
Could end up
being <i>Land of the Dinosaurs.</i>

15:50.867 --> 15:52.786
So we're just going to use it
for feedback.

15:54.204 --> 15:56.414
Perfect.

15:56.831 --> 15:59.292
You know, it's a myth
that we only use 10 percent of our brains.

15:59.584 --> 16:02.462
However, it is true
that it's only a few neurons

16:02.629 --> 16:03.880
that make all the noise.

16:04.589 --> 16:07.050
The rest keep quiet.
Look at this here.

16:14.557 --> 16:16.393
The reticular activating system.

16:16.977 --> 16:19.729
Primarily involved
in the sleep-wake transition.

16:22.732 --> 16:24.526
Extremely hyperactive.

16:26.194 --> 16:30.281
I suspect this is what's causing
her hallucinations.

16:30.448 --> 16:33.994
Vivid waking nightmares that are sending
her adrenal system into overdrive,

16:34.411 --> 16:36.913
putting her in a state
of extreme fight or flight.

16:41.668 --> 16:44.337
- They were all scared to death.
- Mm. Precisely.

16:44.921 --> 16:46.297
Well, how do we stop it?

16:47.549 --> 16:48.633
How do you cure fear?

16:53.471 --> 16:55.265
We're two minutes
from the blackout zone

16:55.432 --> 16:57.976
and 10 minutes from the hotel
Agent Rodriguez called you from.

16:58.768 --> 17:00.520
We'll grab her first,
then Fitz can do his thing.

17:00.895 --> 17:02.230
That doesn't make sense.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.107
EMPs only short-circuit electronics

17:04.273 --> 17:05.942
that have been turned on
at the time.

17:06.108 --> 17:08.278
- Your point?
- Well, I haven't heard from her since.

17:08.444 --> 17:10.113
I mean, she can't find a phone
that was turned off?

17:10.530 --> 17:12.991
Does the backseat science
department care to weigh in on this?

17:13.742 --> 17:16.036
She's at a bachelorette party.
She's probably having a good time,

17:16.202 --> 17:18.788
dancing and drinking
with all those sexy Latino guys.

17:18.954 --> 17:20.874
Nah, I'm not taking that bait.

17:22.916 --> 17:24.169
We're here to protect you.

17:24.752 --> 17:28.840
Inhumans are attacking our cities,
but we have to fight back.

17:29.340 --> 17:31.760
We have reliable information
there's an Inhuman here

17:32.093 --> 17:34.137
in this hotel, right now.

17:34.304 --> 17:38.641
If anyone knows who it is,
it's your duty to turn it in.

17:41.644 --> 17:44.064
If one of those freaks of nature
was here, we'd know.

17:44.939 --> 17:46.441
They're people, too.

17:46.608 --> 17:48.318
They deserve to be here
as much as we do.

17:48.693 --> 17:51.613
Are you serious?
Is this what L.A. did to you?

17:52.113 --> 17:53.823
Please don't tell me
you're a vegan, too.

17:54.949 --> 18:00.038
Hey, I'm on your side, brother,
and I think I know who it is.

18:00.288 --> 18:02.040
He calls himself The Amazing Mertz.

18:02.207 --> 18:04.375
He was doing all kinds
of weird stuff earlier.

18:04.542 --> 18:05.668
He claims it's a gift.

18:08.046 --> 18:09.255
What are you doing?

18:09.589 --> 18:11.216
Please, it's not me.

18:12.008 --> 18:13.384
I swear I'm not one of them.

18:14.177 --> 18:16.054
- Tell us the truth!
- I swear! I swear.

18:16.221 --> 18:19.307
<i>They've hit six cities now.
It's getting messy.</i>

18:19.474 --> 18:22.268
<i>There's rioting, looting.
People are demanding action.</i>

18:22.435 --> 18:24.562
I've got agents headed
to every location.

18:24.729 --> 18:26.189
We're just entering
the blackout zone now.

18:26.356 --> 18:27.941
- Give us time to...
<i>- I need a win, Phil.</i>

18:28.566 --> 18:29.776
<i>Capital "W."</i>

18:30.068 --> 18:32.570
<i>Been on the phone with the President
and he says if we don't have answers soon,</i>

18:32.779 --> 18:33.863
<i>he's going to do some...</i>

18:41.162 --> 18:42.247
What the hell happened?

18:42.413 --> 18:44.707
We must have got hit
with another EMP pulse

18:44.874 --> 18:46.292
when we crossed
into the blackout zone.

18:47.127 --> 18:49.963
- It's either that or...
- No, that's it.

18:52.882 --> 18:54.175
Can I get some help here?

18:56.177 --> 18:57.428
That's worthless.

18:57.804 --> 18:58.805
That's worthless.

18:58.972 --> 19:01.683
Worthless, worthless,
it's all worthless, everything!

19:02.016 --> 19:03.059
What's going on, Fitz?

19:03.309 --> 19:05.311
Wasn't a second pulse,
it's an ongoing series of them,

19:05.478 --> 19:07.564
which means
it's a continuous pulse EMP,

19:07.730 --> 19:08.773
which is extremely advanced,

19:08.940 --> 19:10.650
which means none
of our tech is going to work.

19:10.817 --> 19:13.111
Okay, so how are we supposed to find
the source without your toys?

19:14.654 --> 19:15.655
We do it old-school.

19:20.910 --> 19:24.330
So, no tech, no transpo, no weapons

19:24.497 --> 19:27.333
and our only hope
is the professor's slide rule?

19:27.917 --> 19:29.669
Yeah, that about sums it up.

19:34.048 --> 19:37.677
You know what's a good light source?
A guy with a flaming head.

19:38.344 --> 19:39.721
I'm really bummed I missed that.

19:39.929 --> 19:41.723
- No, you're not.
- Sir...

19:42.891 --> 19:44.142
it was quite unsettling.

19:49.314 --> 19:51.232
We need to do something
about your arm.

19:52.066 --> 19:53.151
I heard it snap.

19:54.736 --> 19:56.362
I can't believe
you haven't passed out.

19:56.529 --> 19:57.864
I can't go to the hospital.

19:59.032 --> 20:00.700
Yeah, well, I figured that much.

20:02.035 --> 20:04.495
What do you do
when you get hurt during your...

20:06.122 --> 20:07.207
night job?

20:07.540 --> 20:09.167
Do you have a guy
who takes care of it?

20:09.500 --> 20:11.961
A guy? No.

20:13.588 --> 20:14.923
No, I don't get hurt.

20:17.383 --> 20:19.469
You gave me a pretty bad gash
at the junkyard...

20:22.013 --> 20:23.097
now?

20:24.265 --> 20:25.266
Not a scratch?

20:25.558 --> 20:30.855
I've been stabbed, shot,
run over, twice.

20:32.690 --> 20:33.983
Next day, I'm good as new.

20:34.901 --> 20:35.985
Lucky you.

20:38.571 --> 20:39.572
Lucky me.

20:40.156 --> 20:41.991
Point is, I don't know
how to help you.

20:42.617 --> 20:44.702
I can get you medicine,
some supplies.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.580
Might as well take advantage
of the darkness.

21:02.762 --> 21:05.098
The man in all the pictures,
is that your dad?

21:05.265 --> 21:07.600
Uncle Eli, he raised us.

21:08.184 --> 21:09.519
Yo, I got to head to Canelo's.

21:10.061 --> 21:11.688
This late? Why?

21:12.063 --> 21:13.815
With all the power out,
there's going to be looting.

21:16.985 --> 21:18.861
Gabe doesn't know
about the night job

21:19.112 --> 21:20.822
and he never will, understood?

21:25.827 --> 21:27.912
Plates are in the cabinet,
forks are in the drawer.

21:28.538 --> 21:29.622
If you want some.

21:33.001 --> 21:35.878
- Tell us the truth!
- I am. I'm not one of them.

21:36.045 --> 21:39.632
- I don't have powers.
- He's lying. We all saw him.

21:39.882 --> 21:41.301
It's sleight of hand, you moron.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.594
Not a superpower.

21:46.097 --> 21:47.807
Let's see if you can make
a bullet disappear.

21:50.852 --> 21:52.145
You want to do the honours?

21:57.442 --> 21:59.527
- Where the hell is it? Who took it?
- It's him!

21:59.694 --> 22:03.031
- I told you he made it disappear.
- I didn't do anything.

22:03.323 --> 22:04.365
I swear.

22:05.325 --> 22:06.743
Now you see it...

22:12.874 --> 22:15.793
No. Elena, how did you?

22:15.960 --> 22:17.337
- Maria.
- Get away.

22:17.837 --> 22:18.796
Maria.

22:19.172 --> 22:21.799
It's her, she has the gun.
She's the Inhuman!

22:54.540 --> 22:55.750
Stop or she's dead!

23:08.096 --> 23:10.306
You see?
You don't have to be scared.

23:11.015 --> 23:12.392
Stay away from me.

23:13.059 --> 23:15.603
Maria, it's still me,
I'm still the same.

23:16.312 --> 23:18.523
No, you're one of them.

23:18.689 --> 23:21.317
Yes, but I'm still Elena,
your friend.

23:25.238 --> 23:26.364
No.

23:32.662 --> 23:33.746
You okay?

23:35.331 --> 23:37.250
At least I don't have to wear
a stupid dress.

23:38.292 --> 23:39.710
Any idea who they are?

23:41.337 --> 23:43.798
- Why they're here?
- They were here for me.

23:43.965 --> 23:46.134
They knew I was in Miami
in this hotel.

23:46.467 --> 23:47.677
How's that possible?

23:47.844 --> 23:50.054
I thought us registered people
were protected.

23:50.346 --> 23:51.639
Search these guys.

23:51.806 --> 23:54.225
I think my worst nightmare
may have just come true.

23:54.392 --> 23:56.310
No, let... Stay away from me!

23:56.477 --> 23:59.188
We're running out of time!
We need to do something! Anything!

23:59.355 --> 24:00.523
It's okay, it's okay.

24:04.110 --> 24:05.820
I think I know
how to solve all our problems.

24:05.987 --> 24:07.155
How? What is it?

24:08.698 --> 24:10.158
We're going to have to kill her.

24:14.412 --> 24:17.790
One chimpanzee, two chimpanzee.

24:18.624 --> 24:21.252
One chimpanzee, two chimpanzee.

24:21.419 --> 24:23.129
How did you know
there was an Inhuman here?

24:23.504 --> 24:26.340
- Who do you work for?
- I'm just a concerned citizen.

24:27.008 --> 24:28.342
Then we have something in common.

24:28.509 --> 24:30.553
Because right now,
I'm concerned about vigilantes

24:30.720 --> 24:32.555
who target Inhumans
during a blackout.

24:32.847 --> 24:35.099
- Whose side are you on?
- Not yours.

24:35.266 --> 24:37.018
What the hell are you doing?

24:41.314 --> 24:43.858
Concerned citizens don't walk around
wearing battle gear.

24:44.525 --> 24:46.486
This isn't your average weekend
warrior vest.

24:46.652 --> 24:48.237
This is advanced military tech.

24:48.404 --> 24:49.780
Just like the EMP.

24:50.406 --> 24:53.367
This isn't the Inhumans, it's a setup.
They're being hunted.

24:56.871 --> 24:58.247
And guess who's doing the hunting.

25:05.338 --> 25:07.673
So, how do you know Robbie?

25:08.174 --> 25:10.134
I don't, he gave me a ride.

25:12.345 --> 25:13.846
He never gives anyone a ride

25:14.138 --> 25:15.598
and you're definitely not
from this hood.

25:16.682 --> 25:18.601
I don't know,
maybe he felt sorry for me.

25:19.852 --> 25:20.937
Damsel in distress.

25:21.979 --> 25:24.565
- How'd you hurt your arm?
- Hit by a car.

25:24.732 --> 25:26.108
How'd you end up in a wheelchair?

25:28.110 --> 25:30.988
Wrong place, wrong time, years ago.

25:31.989 --> 25:33.282
I made peace with it, though.

25:35.326 --> 25:36.744
And Robbie takes care of you?

25:37.495 --> 25:39.080
Takes care of me?
I take care of his ass.

25:39.705 --> 25:41.624
Was that funny?

25:42.166 --> 25:43.834
I just wonder
what he would say to that.

25:44.168 --> 25:45.503
Doesn't seem like he needs it.

25:46.837 --> 25:50.216
Well, without me, his wheels,
they would come off.

25:51.050 --> 25:53.135
You know, he's always out at night,
always alone.

25:54.387 --> 25:56.514
Thought it was gambling,
maybe racing again,

25:56.681 --> 25:57.848
maybe drugs, I don't know.

26:00.434 --> 26:03.521
I do know bad things come
from bad people.

26:05.565 --> 26:06.941
And you think I'm one of them?

26:15.283 --> 26:17.743
- The Watchdogs are behind this?
- Or someone's behind them.

26:17.910 --> 26:20.079
This was an orchestrated
worldwide attack.

26:20.454 --> 26:21.747
Their turf has always been domestic.

26:22.498 --> 26:23.624
Found something.

26:29.422 --> 26:30.965
Asset numbers and addresses.

26:31.841 --> 26:33.092
This is what I was afraid of.

26:33.259 --> 26:34.760
This is
from the Inhuman Registration list.

26:34.927 --> 26:37.263
And every time an asset's on the move,
it's automatically updated.

26:37.430 --> 26:39.265
- That's how they knew she was here.
- How did they get it?

26:39.432 --> 26:40.891
I'm pretty sure
it didn't come out of S.H.I.E.L.D.,

26:40.975 --> 26:42.476
but we're not the only agency that has it.

26:42.643 --> 26:44.729
Not to mention every nation
that signed the Accords.

26:44.895 --> 26:47.148
Well, no matter how tight security is,
things have a way of disappearing.

26:47.940 --> 26:50.693
Lists, weapons, meds.

26:51.068 --> 26:54.071
And if they're hunting Inhumans here,
they're hunting them in the other cities.

26:54.238 --> 26:56.407
With communications down,
we have no way to warn them.

26:56.574 --> 26:59.493
Yeah, well, might not be down much longer
because I think I can solve this.

27:01.537 --> 27:04.332
- By getting tanked?
- What? No, I just need the corks

27:04.624 --> 27:07.209
and I'm also going to need some needles
and some bowls of water.

27:09.295 --> 27:11.714
What, didn't any of you guys
go to the Scouts? We're making compasses.

27:13.174 --> 27:16.135
Come on, it's rudimentary science.
Yeah, no big deal.

27:16.302 --> 27:18.137
Just rudimentary science,
maybe saving the day.

27:18.596 --> 27:20.306
Think of her brain

27:20.473 --> 27:23.559
as a computer that's been compromised
by bugs and glitches.

27:23.726 --> 27:25.519
If we shut it down and reboot it,

27:25.686 --> 27:28.564
then the parts of her brain
that have been hyper-activated

27:28.898 --> 27:30.566
should reset back to default.

27:30.733 --> 27:31.734
This is crazy.

27:31.901 --> 27:34.236
Without a doubt, but we're out
of time and out of options.

27:34.403 --> 27:38.240
Okay.
Well, once her heart stops,

27:38.824 --> 27:42.286
we'll have approximately seven minutes
before she has irreparable brain damage

27:42.453 --> 27:43.537
and can't be brought back at all.

27:43.704 --> 27:45.247
During which time,
we monitor her brain activity

27:45.414 --> 27:46.707
and once
it reaches minimum threshold...

27:46.874 --> 27:49.710
We'll shock her back to life
and hope that your theory is correct.

27:49.877 --> 27:51.712
Exactly. Maybe we'll all go
and have lots of drinks.

27:51.879 --> 27:52.922
Right, you ready?

27:54.090 --> 27:57.134
Hell no, I'm not ready.
We're about to kill May!

27:58.302 --> 28:00.221
We're about to save May.

28:09.897 --> 28:12.191
It's okay. I'm so sorry.

28:31.919 --> 28:34.880
The EMP releases a pulse
every two seconds

28:35.047 --> 28:37.216
and for that one moment,
it becomes magnetic north,

28:37.383 --> 28:39.301
causing your needles to move
a few degrees in that direction.

28:39.468 --> 28:41.929
Now, based on how much
they move each time,

28:42.096 --> 28:45.099
I should be able to triangulate
the source of the EMP

28:45.266 --> 28:47.476
or at least get in the ballpark.

28:47.727 --> 28:50.563
- Ready when you are, Slide-Rule.
- Yeah, okay.

28:50.730 --> 28:52.148
Okay. Call them out as they move.

28:52.314 --> 28:53.649
Thirty-five degrees east.

28:53.816 --> 28:55.693
- Five degrees west.
- Ten degrees east.

28:55.776 --> 28:57.570
Okay, here it comes again.
Look alive!

29:00.322 --> 29:03.033
- We have less than two minutes.
- Okay.

29:03.576 --> 29:05.911
We're approaching minimum brain
activity threshold.

29:06.495 --> 29:08.038
Get ready.

29:13.377 --> 29:16.422
One, two...

29:19.508 --> 29:21.510
- What the hell happened?
- I don't know, we've lost power.

29:21.677 --> 29:23.846
Not here, not now.

29:24.013 --> 29:25.014
I don't understand.

29:25.181 --> 29:26.432
The backup generator
should have kicked in.

29:27.850 --> 29:30.144
- Come on, May!
- Oh, God, that's not good.

29:30.311 --> 29:31.562
Come on.

29:34.732 --> 29:37.067
Come on, May.

29:39.612 --> 29:40.696
Come on.

29:41.363 --> 29:43.616
I don't understand,
what happened to the bloody power?

29:46.577 --> 29:47.953
We just lost part of DC.

29:52.583 --> 29:53.918
Yes, Mr President.

29:57.379 --> 29:58.756
Uh, watching now, sir.

30:00.132 --> 30:01.717
<i>We now control seven cities.</i>

30:02.134 --> 30:06.138
<i>If you do not end the registration
of Inhumans in 24 hours,</i>

30:06.430 --> 30:08.182
<i>we will black out seven more.</i>

30:08.974 --> 30:10.601
Yes, Mr President.

30:10.768 --> 30:12.853
I understand the gravity
of the situation.

30:13.020 --> 30:14.730
Just give me one more hour.

30:14.897 --> 30:16.690
Agent Coulson and his team
are on the case.

30:17.817 --> 30:18.818
Thank you, sir.

30:22.196 --> 30:24.949
President wants to send troops
into the blackout zones.

30:25.115 --> 30:27.952
Take out the Inhumans
by any means necessary.

30:30.538 --> 30:34.083
Come on, Coulson, bring me that win.

30:35.334 --> 30:37.253
- Thirty degrees east.
- Ten degrees west.

30:37.419 --> 30:39.672
- Ten degrees east.
- Okay, got it.

30:46.720 --> 30:47.721
There.

30:49.139 --> 30:50.140
X marks the spot.

30:52.560 --> 30:53.727
All right, let's go.

30:54.520 --> 30:55.980
You have to come back.

30:57.815 --> 30:59.149
I'm not losing you.

31:00.359 --> 31:01.485
I promised.

31:02.027 --> 31:04.446
Do you hear me, Agent May?
You have to come back!

31:05.322 --> 31:06.365
That's an order!

31:08.617 --> 31:10.536
We need ice,
we need to keep her cold.

31:10.995 --> 31:14.039
That's really not...
I mean, at this point...

31:15.374 --> 31:17.543
If we could only jumpstart,
a battery or...

31:36.770 --> 31:38.063
I'm sorry.

31:43.485 --> 31:45.613
- What is it?
- It's a self-sustaining,

31:45.779 --> 31:47.323
magnetically shielded
clean energy device.

31:47.489 --> 31:48.949
It's a prototype of something
I've been working on

31:49.116 --> 31:51.368
in my spare time.
Might just do the trick.

31:54.788 --> 31:56.498
- Go.
- Come on, May.

31:56.665 --> 31:57.875
Fight it!

31:59.043 --> 32:02.421
- Again.
- Wake up! Come on, May. Fight!

32:03.797 --> 32:06.550
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

32:08.802 --> 32:11.680
Where am I?

32:13.015 --> 32:15.476
Get this crap off of me.

32:17.895 --> 32:19.563
Welcome back, Agent May.

32:21.941 --> 32:23.359
Did I miss something?

32:31.283 --> 32:33.410
Looks empty, you sure
this is the right place?

32:33.577 --> 32:35.663
I said I'd get us in the ballpark.

32:35.829 --> 32:37.164
I don't know, Turbo.

32:41.794 --> 32:42.795
Halt.

32:57.309 --> 33:00.604
Oh, my goodness. Yes,
Fitz was right, the EMP is here.

33:00.771 --> 33:02.898
Yeah, the bad news
is we're outgunned.

33:04.024 --> 33:05.109
Any suggestions?

33:12.116 --> 33:13.242
What's that?

33:16.870 --> 33:17.871
Hey!

33:33.470 --> 33:34.805
- Hey, my gun!
- My gun's gone!

33:34.972 --> 33:35.973
The Inhumans!

34:05.002 --> 34:07.379
Okay, all set.
Let there be light.

34:14.928 --> 34:17.848
Welcome back, fellas.

34:21.518 --> 34:23.771
So many people looking
for an excuse to hate.

34:24.271 --> 34:25.438
It's spreading.

34:25.606 --> 34:26.940
Passports, visas.

34:27.107 --> 34:29.025
Somebody's taking
the Watchdogs global.

34:31.235 --> 34:32.279
Yeah, this is Agent Coulson.

34:32.446 --> 34:34.822
Get me the Director.
We have a solve.

34:40.079 --> 34:42.915
They're saying on the news earlier
that the Inhumans caused the blackouts.

34:43.956 --> 34:45.876
- Think that's true?
- No idea.

34:47.127 --> 34:48.420
I've never met one.

34:49.670 --> 34:52.716
Just know that people
don't like them because they're different.

34:53.509 --> 34:54.760
I've been there.

34:56.053 --> 34:57.679
That doesn't look so great.

34:58.764 --> 35:00.140
I don't know why
you're not at the ER.

35:00.307 --> 35:02.226
It won't do any good.
There's no power.

35:04.436 --> 35:07.022
Looks like
someone's watching out for you.

35:07.189 --> 35:09.149
That excuse
won't work anymore, Daisy,

35:10.234 --> 35:11.527
if that's your real name.

35:12.736 --> 35:13.737
I've had a few.

35:15.531 --> 35:16.615
Yeah?

35:17.741 --> 35:18.909
One of them "Quake"?

35:21.495 --> 35:24.039
Look, that guy who had the gun
to my head went flying.

35:25.207 --> 35:26.792
How did that happen?

35:27.459 --> 35:29.044
I felt the earth rumble.

35:29.837 --> 35:32.339
Nothing there but you
in a lot of pain.

35:33.048 --> 35:34.758
But so afraid to go to the hospital.

35:37.845 --> 35:39.263
Hey, don't worry,

35:40.889 --> 35:42.349
your secret's safe with me.

35:45.435 --> 35:46.937
Thanks, Gabe.

35:47.479 --> 35:48.730
As long as you leave

35:49.648 --> 35:51.650
and never come near
my brother again.

35:51.817 --> 35:53.777
Robbie needs good people around him

35:55.988 --> 35:57.114
and that's not you.

36:01.368 --> 36:03.912
The man with the list
and the ones guarding the EMP,

36:04.079 --> 36:05.622
they all had Watchdog tattoos.

36:06.039 --> 36:07.624
And some serious hardware.

36:07.791 --> 36:09.209
Someone's backing them.

36:09.376 --> 36:11.753
With big-time resources
and foreign involvement.

36:12.087 --> 36:14.173
Whoever it is, they've declared war
on the Inhumans.

36:14.339 --> 36:15.549
Well, that's working.

36:15.716 --> 36:17.509
Fear is spreading
like wildfire out there.

36:17.676 --> 36:19.761
- How do we counter that?
- Maybe it's time.

36:20.387 --> 36:23.682
No, it's too soon, Phil.
We've a specific plan for the roll-out.

36:25.434 --> 36:26.727
Can I offer you some advice?

36:27.811 --> 36:29.229
Something I learned from Fury.

36:30.564 --> 36:32.608
It's important to know
when to throw out the plan.

36:34.067 --> 36:35.652
And you think this is one
of those moments?

36:35.986 --> 36:37.654
That's for you to decide, Director.

36:50.167 --> 36:53.128
No? Okay.

36:55.339 --> 36:56.924
I wish Daisy were here to see this.

37:00.677 --> 37:01.678
Nothing?

37:04.389 --> 37:05.599
So you're not going to come clean?

37:07.267 --> 37:09.645
We know you've been communicating
with her, Yo-Yo.

37:13.398 --> 37:16.360
- I gave her my word.
- What, that you'd lie?

37:16.860 --> 37:18.695
You knew we were out there
looking for her.

37:18.862 --> 37:21.323
You could have helped us,
you could have made contact.

37:21.490 --> 37:24.409
But instead, you used me
to get meds for her.

37:24.701 --> 37:26.370
She's the one who makes contact.

37:26.828 --> 37:29.623
And Daisy doesn't want to be found,
so you should respect that.

37:29.831 --> 37:32.626
Look, she's hurt and she's in danger
and she's mixed up with that...

37:33.418 --> 37:35.254
I don't know what the hell
it is, but it ain't good.

37:36.588 --> 37:37.923
The man on fire?

37:45.347 --> 37:46.348
You knew about this?

37:51.937 --> 37:54.523
- Angry looks good on you, Mack.
- Don't do that.

37:54.982 --> 37:56.149
Don't shrug this off.

37:56.316 --> 37:58.318
There shouldn't be any secrets
between us.

37:58.610 --> 38:01.571
Why not?
There's nothing else between us.

38:04.032 --> 38:06.618
All right, has everybody seen
this guy but me?

38:07.869 --> 38:10.747
I've only heard talk,
he's a legend out there.

38:12.374 --> 38:15.585
The, uh... Ghost Rider.

38:16.128 --> 38:17.879
Most people think it's folklore.

38:18.130 --> 38:19.548
No, he's real.

38:20.048 --> 38:22.175
- We find anything else?
- No, not on him.

38:22.759 --> 38:23.969
I did get a list of faculty

38:24.136 --> 38:26.513
that worked in the Momentum Energy Labs
back when it was operational.

38:26.763 --> 38:29.725
- Could be something to look into.
- Oh, hey, there he is.

38:31.476 --> 38:33.395
<i>Hello, everyone, I'm Jeffrey Mace</i>

38:33.562 --> 38:37.149
<i>and the president has asked me
to address recent events</i>

38:37.316 --> 38:38.817
<i>that have many of you concerned.</i>

38:39.484 --> 38:42.112
<i>You all know who I am, you know my work
with international affairs.</i>

38:42.279 --> 38:43.530
<i>But most importantly,</i>

38:44.448 --> 38:48.493
<i>you know I'm a straight shooter,
so let's set the record straight.</i>

38:49.286 --> 38:52.789
<i>The Inhumans were not responsible
for the recent blackouts.</i>

38:53.165 --> 38:58.587
<i>They were caused by human extremists
hell-bent on spreading fear.</i>

38:58.920 --> 39:01.923
<i>Fear of these new members
of our community.</i>

39:03.383 --> 39:05.260
<i>They want to turn us
against each other.</i>

39:06.261 --> 39:07.554
<i>But I'm here to tell you,</i>

39:10.265 --> 39:11.391
<i>that's not going to work.</i>

39:12.976 --> 39:14.061
Where's Daisy?

39:14.269 --> 39:17.272
I don't know. Fell asleep.
When I woke up, she was gone.

39:20.692 --> 39:21.777
<i>And it won't work</i>

39:22.444 --> 39:24.529
<i>because there's an old friend
back in town,</i>

39:24.696 --> 39:26.073
<i>here to deal with this threat</i>

39:26.239 --> 39:28.116
<i>and any other threat
that comes our way.</i>

39:28.784 --> 39:30.410
<i>And last night, that old friend</i>

39:30.952 --> 39:35.082
<i>turned all the lights back on,
saving countless lives.</i>

39:36.541 --> 39:37.584
<i>And that old friend</i>

39:39.503 --> 39:40.837
<i>is S.H.I.E.L.D.</i>

39:47.344 --> 39:48.804
Hope we're doing the right thing.

39:49.346 --> 39:50.806
I liked working in the shadows.

39:52.057 --> 39:54.434
Well, at least you won't have
to live in them anymore.

39:54.935 --> 39:57.020
Excuse me.

39:57.604 --> 39:59.272
<i>...smartest minds
I've had the pleasure of knowing...</i>

40:00.690 --> 40:03.402
Hey, I hear you're a little bit more
yourself.

40:04.361 --> 40:06.571
- I feel cranky.
<i>- Like I said.</i>

40:08.156 --> 40:09.533
That should be you up there.

40:10.700 --> 40:13.745
No, I'm right where I belong.

40:14.746 --> 40:17.624
<i>...we're back
and we're here to protect you.</i>

40:18.041 --> 40:22.003
<i>All of you. Human and Inhuman alike.</i>

40:23.088 --> 40:27.008
<i>When others try to tear us apart,
it only brings us together.</i>

40:29.553 --> 40:30.637
<i>We're all on the same team</i>

40:32.222 --> 40:35.350
<i>because a team that trusts
is a team that...</i>

40:44.317 --> 40:47.070
<i>S.H.I.E.L.D. was a puppet of HYDRA</i>

40:47.237 --> 40:49.239
<i>and now they'll be puppets
of the Inhumans.</i>

40:49.906 --> 40:52.659
<i>I have very credible sources
that are telling me</i>

40:52.826 --> 40:54.870
<i>the Inhumans were responsible
for the blackouts</i>

40:55.036 --> 40:57.080
<i>despite what Jeffrey Mace may say.</i>

40:57.205 --> 40:58.707
<i>That was Senator Nadeer,</i>

40:58.832 --> 41:00.250
<i>weighing in
on the government's announcement</i>

41:00.417 --> 41:01.918
<i>of the return of the Strategic...</i>

41:02.085 --> 41:03.336
Give me some good news.

41:03.587 --> 41:05.213
<i>Even though S.H.I.E.L.D. managed</i>

41:05.380 --> 41:06.423
<i>to turn on all the power,</i>

41:06.590 --> 41:09.050
<i>we were able to eliminate
17 Inhumans worldwide.</i>

41:09.217 --> 41:11.052
Good. Good start.

41:11.720 --> 41:13.430
I'm at my brother's place,
but I'll be heading out now.

41:13.597 --> 41:15.348
I'll call you from the car
for the play-by-play.

41:18.518 --> 41:21.021
<i>...in numerous
major cities around the globe.</i>

41:21.188 --> 41:24.107
<i>Under the leadership of recently
appointed Director Jeffrey Mace,</i>

41:24.274 --> 41:26.610
<i>S.H.I.E.L.D. has recommitted itself
to its pledge...</i>

41:26.776 --> 41:28.069
You want me to turn it off?

41:29.029 --> 41:31.323
You know what? I'll leave it on,
keep you company.

41:32.782 --> 41:34.618
I'll be back in a few days
to check in.

41:36.453 --> 41:38.914
<i>...Senator Nadeer
have expressed continued doubts...</i>

41:40.165 --> 41:41.166
Love you.

41:42.125 --> 41:43.960
<i>...Director Jeffrey Mace</i>

41:44.169 --> 41:46.421
<i>that there is nothing to fear
from the Inhumans</i>

41:46.588 --> 41:48.423
<i>living secretly among us.</i>
