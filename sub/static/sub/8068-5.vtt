[theme music]

00:46.414 --> 00:49.783
[laughing]

00:54.388 --> 00:55.889
No, I just want to see
that lumber first thing

00:55.989 --> 00:58.192
tomorrow morning, period.

00:58.292 --> 01:00.494
Period.

01:00.594 --> 01:01.729
Whew.

01:01.829 --> 01:04.732
DJ, please don't drive your
truck on my blueprints.

01:07.568 --> 01:10.804
[car sounds]

01:12.140 --> 01:14.575
I can't believe they shorted
me 25 pieces of lumber.

01:14.675 --> 01:16.144
May they rot in hell.

01:19.313 --> 01:21.649
I got the receipt.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.151
Well, I got something
that'll cheer you up.

01:23.251 --> 01:25.052
Oh yeah?
You got 25 two-by-fours?

01:25.153 --> 01:27.721
Yeah, and you know
what else I got?

01:27.821 --> 01:30.558
I got this official entry
blank for that radio station

01:30.658 --> 01:32.126
country-western
songwriting contest.

01:32.226 --> 01:33.026
So?

01:33.127 --> 01:33.927
So?

01:34.027 --> 01:35.095
I ain't entering no contest.

01:35.196 --> 01:36.530
Come on, you should do it.

01:36.630 --> 01:37.765
It would be a hoot.

01:37.865 --> 01:39.633
You're the writer in
the the family, you do it.

01:39.733 --> 01:41.702
Well, I don't got
no musical talent.

01:41.802 --> 01:43.271
You're the one with
the trunk full of songs

01:43.371 --> 01:44.572
out in the garage.

01:44.672 --> 01:46.374
Honey, I wrote
that stuff years ago.

01:46.474 --> 01:47.508
Well, you know,
you ought to dig

01:47.608 --> 01:49.343
one out and just send it in.
- Nuh-uh.

01:49.443 --> 01:50.744
No way.

01:50.844 --> 01:53.947
Come on, you're
really good at it.

01:54.047 --> 01:55.483
Nope, no contest
for this cowboy.

02:01.489 --> 02:03.624
What-- what could you win?

02:07.361 --> 02:08.462
What difference does it make?

02:08.562 --> 02:11.499
You're not going
to enjoy it anyway.

02:11.599 --> 02:13.100
Well, just curious.

02:13.201 --> 02:15.569
Well, the first
prize is $100 plus you

02:15.669 --> 02:17.938
get to hear your song
played over the radio.

02:18.038 --> 02:20.140
Ahh, I ain't got no talent.

02:20.241 --> 02:23.043
Come on, you know
you want to do it.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.346
It would be kind of nice
hearing one of my songs

02:25.446 --> 02:27.815
played on the radio.

02:27.915 --> 02:30.618
Dan, you can no
longer deprive the world

02:30.718 --> 02:31.819
of your special talent.

02:35.323 --> 02:36.123
Maybe you're right.

02:38.959 --> 02:41.094
Of course I'm right.

02:41.195 --> 02:42.996
You need to cut it
loose and set it free.

02:46.066 --> 02:48.236
Do it for humanity.

02:48.336 --> 02:50.170
Do it for the children.

02:50.271 --> 02:52.406
Do it for the stinkin' $100.

02:52.506 --> 02:53.307
Bingo.

02:53.407 --> 02:56.744
[music playing]

03:14.662 --> 03:16.364
What are you doing?

03:16.464 --> 03:18.432
Getting something to eat.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.200
Your break isn't
for two minutes.

03:20.301 --> 03:24.672
Well, then I'll go back
to work two minutes early.

03:24.772 --> 03:26.106
Sit down, Harris.

03:26.206 --> 03:27.074
Sit down.

03:32.413 --> 03:35.583
You know, you have
an attitude problem.

03:35.683 --> 03:36.484
I do?

03:36.584 --> 03:38.486
Oh, yes.

03:38.586 --> 03:40.053
And I was thinking
that we should,

03:40.153 --> 03:43.357
uh, work on it someplace
outside of the workplace.

03:43.457 --> 03:44.358
Where would you suggest?

03:44.458 --> 03:45.926
The back seat of your car?

03:49.229 --> 03:51.965
No, no, I was thinking,
um, more along the lines

03:52.065 --> 03:53.133
of my apartment.

03:56.970 --> 04:01.575
There is no way that I'm gonna
end up a notch on your bedpost.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.277
[horn blows]

04:04.278 --> 04:05.813
I'm not coming on to you.

04:05.913 --> 04:06.914
You think I'm coming on to you?

04:07.014 --> 04:08.215
It crossed my mind.

04:08.316 --> 04:09.216
No.

04:09.317 --> 04:11.151
No, no, see I'm--

04:11.251 --> 04:16.557
I'm just trying to improve
employee-management relations.

04:16.657 --> 04:17.891
Nice save, Booker.

04:17.991 --> 04:18.792
Thank you.

04:18.892 --> 04:21.128
What's that?

04:21.228 --> 04:22.296
Looks like a phone number.

04:25.399 --> 04:29.537
Let's work on that attitude.

04:29.637 --> 04:33.140
Roseanne, what kind of
song is Dan going to enter?

04:33.240 --> 04:35.008
Oh, he hadn't
even decided yet.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.444
I bet it'll be romantic.

04:36.544 --> 04:38.346
Can't go wrong
with a love song.

04:38.446 --> 04:40.881
Nah, love songs are hokey.

04:40.981 --> 04:43.417
I like something I can dance to.

04:43.517 --> 04:45.853
Get down, Sylvia.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.621
It's a country-western
station, right?

04:47.721 --> 04:48.689
Yeah.

04:48.789 --> 04:49.923
Well, then the song
doesn't even matter.

04:50.023 --> 04:51.425
All that counts is the title.

04:51.525 --> 04:54.027
Well, sis, I guess you're
an expert on that too, huh?

04:54.127 --> 04:56.096
That happens to be true.

04:56.196 --> 04:58.065
Look at the classic "Take
This Job and Shove It."

04:58.165 --> 04:59.867
Yeah.
[interposing voices]

04:59.967 --> 05:02.002
You know what Dan should
really try to write?

05:02.102 --> 05:03.404
A road song.

05:03.504 --> 05:04.304
Gosh, you're right.

05:04.405 --> 05:05.673
I love road songs.

05:05.773 --> 05:08.241
When that whiskey-voiced guy
starts singing about highways

05:08.342 --> 05:10.344
and byways and stuff.

05:10.444 --> 05:14.348
What exactly is the difference
between a highway and a byway?

05:14.448 --> 05:17.385
OK, a highway is
the main road, right?

05:17.485 --> 05:21.789
And the byway is the road
that runs right along by it.

05:21.889 --> 05:23.691
No.

05:23.791 --> 05:25.759
No, that's an access road.

05:25.859 --> 05:28.362
A byway is a road that
goes around something.

05:28.462 --> 05:29.697
No, that's a bypass.

05:29.797 --> 05:33.100
There is no difference between
a highway and a byway, OK?

05:33.200 --> 05:35.068
Oh, I'm so glad
you figured that out.

05:35.168 --> 05:39.239
Now, maybe, we can all
get some sleep tonight.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.442
I'll tell you what people
can't get enough of--

05:41.542 --> 05:42.776
hardship songs.

05:42.876 --> 05:44.177
You know, you're right.

05:44.277 --> 05:49.783
There's nothing like a hardship
song to set my toes to tapping.

05:49.883 --> 05:51.885
Well, that's what all
the best songs are about.

05:51.985 --> 05:55.389
Pain, misery, you
know, real life.

05:55.489 --> 05:58.492
My life.

05:58.592 --> 06:01.495
My parents kicked me out
of house when I was 16.

06:01.595 --> 06:04.998
Moved in with crazy Aunt Ina
and a house full of cats.

06:05.098 --> 06:06.066
Married at 17.

06:06.166 --> 06:08.301
Widowed at 18.

06:08.402 --> 06:11.004
Tornado carried away my car.

06:11.104 --> 06:11.905
Hospitalized for pneumonia.

06:12.005 --> 06:12.806
Everybody sing.

06:16.644 --> 06:19.847
[music playing]

06:23.283 --> 06:24.117
Mom?

06:24.217 --> 06:26.086
The one and only.

06:26.186 --> 06:28.055
Where's Dad?

06:28.155 --> 06:31.291
He's out in the garage, honey,
struggling with the muses.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.694
I need him to fix my truck.

06:33.794 --> 06:34.962
What happened to it?

06:35.062 --> 06:36.396
The wheel fell off.

06:36.497 --> 06:38.566
Give it me.

06:38.666 --> 06:41.435
You don't know
how to fix trucks.

06:41.535 --> 06:43.637
I know how to do
anything, I'm a mom.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.372
Dads are supposed
to fix trucks.

06:45.473 --> 06:47.841
Gave me that.

06:47.941 --> 06:51.344
Let's go sit down here.

06:51.445 --> 06:52.780
BECKY: Don't touch that!

06:52.880 --> 06:54.715
DARLENE: I didn't touch it!

06:54.815 --> 06:57.618
Mom, you hear that?

06:57.718 --> 07:00.153
Yeah, Becky and
Darlene are at it again.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.022
They're giving me a headache.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.727
Me too.

07:06.827 --> 07:08.128
I've had it.

07:08.228 --> 07:09.797
Me too.

07:09.897 --> 07:13.701
They say they're going to
be quiet but they never are.

07:13.801 --> 07:14.902
Yeah, never.

07:15.002 --> 07:16.870
Never.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.005
You know what else?

07:18.105 --> 07:18.906
What?

07:19.006 --> 07:20.407
They're always
in the bathroom.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.378
They're horrible,
rotten girls.

07:25.479 --> 07:27.881
What are we going
to do with them?

07:27.981 --> 07:30.784
Kill 'em.

07:30.884 --> 07:35.523
Na, then I'd just have
to clean up the mess.

07:35.623 --> 07:36.690
I guess we're going
to have to live

07:36.790 --> 07:38.025
with them till they move out.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.594
Yeah.

07:40.694 --> 07:42.496
Well, here you go.

07:42.596 --> 07:44.431
One fixed truck.

07:44.532 --> 07:45.332
Thanks.

07:49.770 --> 07:52.540
[making truck sounds]

07:52.640 --> 07:54.474
BECKY: Just shut up, Darlene!

07:54.575 --> 07:56.844
DARLENE: Hey, it's half my
room too, little miss perfect!

07:56.944 --> 07:58.879
BECKY: Well, you can have
both halves for all I care.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.548
What is your problem?

08:00.648 --> 08:02.516
You're my problem,
you little slob!

08:02.616 --> 08:03.917
You used to be almost normal.

08:04.017 --> 08:05.919
Yeah, until you were born!

08:06.019 --> 08:07.120
Knock it off!

08:07.220 --> 08:09.456
I wish mom and dad had
left you at that hospital.

08:09.557 --> 08:10.691
Shut up, Becky!

08:10.791 --> 08:13.126
Mom!

08:13.226 --> 08:16.530
She's not here.

08:16.630 --> 08:18.498
Mother, I can't spend
another minute in the same room

08:18.599 --> 08:19.667
with her.

08:19.767 --> 08:22.435
And whom, pray tell,
are we talking about?

08:22.536 --> 08:25.272
Mother, please, you know
who I'm talking about.

08:25.372 --> 08:28.075
The pig.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.243
Here's your filthy,
disgusting pillow.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.079
You know, all you two have
been doing this whole week

08:32.179 --> 08:34.615
is fighting, and I really
want it to stop now.

08:34.715 --> 08:36.083
Well, then talk to Darlene.

08:36.183 --> 08:39.219
She leaves all her grungy stuff
all over my side of the room.

08:39.319 --> 08:40.320
What?

08:40.420 --> 08:41.822
I can't leave anything
anywhere without her

08:41.922 --> 08:43.123
going into convulsions.

08:43.223 --> 08:45.793
OK, well, there's only one
way to solve this problem.

08:45.893 --> 08:48.028
Give me that pillow.

08:48.128 --> 08:50.263
Give me that blanket, too.

08:50.363 --> 08:53.500
All right, now turn around
and face each other here.

08:53.601 --> 08:57.437
Now I want you to
fight to the death.

08:57.537 --> 08:58.839
Mother.

08:58.939 --> 09:02.776
Go on, start ripping each
other apart limb from limb.

09:02.876 --> 09:06.513
And whoever is left standing
gets to keep the room.

09:06.614 --> 09:08.015
You know what
she's trying to do.

09:08.115 --> 09:09.950
Well, I do have another plan.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.719
I hate it when she does this.

09:11.819 --> 09:13.654
Go get the masking
tape and run it--

09:13.754 --> 09:15.488
And put a line down
the center of the room.

09:15.589 --> 09:17.524
And stay on your side.

09:17.625 --> 09:19.159
Mom, that never works.

09:19.259 --> 09:22.362
Well, you make it work, girls.

09:22.462 --> 09:23.430
Fine, I'll get the tape.

09:23.530 --> 09:24.331
No, I'll get the tape.

09:24.431 --> 09:25.298
I'm getting the tape.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.400
I'll get the tape.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.269
I'm getting my tubes tied.

09:41.014 --> 09:42.449
Hey, look what I brought you.

09:42.549 --> 09:45.819
Aw, thanks baby,
just put it down here.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.922
This drill hasn't worked
since-- since I bought it.

09:49.022 --> 09:51.258
I thought you was
out here composing.

09:51.358 --> 09:54.762
Oh, I tried a few things
but, uh, I don't know,

09:54.862 --> 09:56.764
I guess I just wasn't inspired.

09:56.864 --> 10:00.067
Well, I'm here now.

10:00.167 --> 10:02.435
And yet, somehow,
I'm still not inspired.

10:05.372 --> 10:06.874
Well, if you're not
going to write no songs

10:06.974 --> 10:09.109
why don't you dig out
some of these to send in.

10:09.209 --> 10:10.978
I already looked, believe
me, there's nothing in there

10:11.078 --> 10:11.879
worth sending.

10:11.979 --> 10:13.080
Oh, don't give me that.

10:13.180 --> 10:15.448
There's bound to be an
undiscovered masterpiece

10:15.548 --> 10:18.919
in here.
- Trust me, they all suck mud.

10:19.019 --> 10:20.654
Face it, I'm a small
time contractor.

10:20.754 --> 10:22.189
I ain't no big time composer.

10:22.289 --> 10:25.292
Well, this is no
big time contest.

10:25.392 --> 10:26.359
What is this?

10:26.459 --> 10:27.494
What?

10:27.594 --> 10:30.530
Oh, baby, baby, give
it to me, give it to me.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.100
Hey baby, baby, give it
to me, give it to me.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.001
Give it to me.

10:34.101 --> 10:36.169
[laughs]

10:36.269 --> 10:37.971
It was a--

10:38.071 --> 10:39.439
it was a dance hit.

10:39.539 --> 10:41.108
Oh, in the '70s I guess.

10:41.208 --> 10:43.443
Yeah, it's just,
lyrics weren't important.

10:43.543 --> 10:44.712
I was really moved by it.

10:44.812 --> 10:48.148
I was getting ready
to give it to you.

10:48.248 --> 10:51.384
Oh, you want to hear
something really bad?

10:51.484 --> 10:52.519
Is it worse than that one?

10:52.619 --> 10:55.288
Much worse, almost criminal.

10:55.388 --> 10:58.591
Oh, baby, baby, give it to me.

10:58.692 --> 11:00.894
I wrote this when I was 19.

11:00.994 --> 11:05.498
Let's see-- blueberry
fantasy, tangerine dream,

11:05.598 --> 11:13.640
love is a rainbow of
incense and cream.

11:13.741 --> 11:17.845
Oh, now I know why you can't
remember your teen years.

11:17.945 --> 11:20.981
It marked the end of
my psychedelic period.

11:21.081 --> 11:22.049
No, that's the one.

11:22.149 --> 11:23.250
You ought to send that in.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.352
Aw, let's just forget
about the contest

11:25.452 --> 11:26.920
and clean up this mess.

11:27.020 --> 11:30.057
All right, you're the boss.

11:30.157 --> 11:32.059
I'm sorry, for a
minute there, I thought

11:32.159 --> 11:34.527
I heard you say I was the boss.

11:34.627 --> 11:37.898
[laughing]

11:40.400 --> 11:41.668
What's that?

11:41.769 --> 11:45.338
Aw, that's nothing, it's just
something I was working on.

11:45.438 --> 11:47.107
Hey, let me hear it.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.608
Well, it doesn't
really have a tune yet.

11:48.708 --> 11:49.509
So?

11:49.609 --> 11:50.410
I want to hear it anyway.

11:50.510 --> 11:52.612
Well, I'm kind of rusty.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.882
Let's see.

11:54.982 --> 11:56.083
There's a river.

11:56.183 --> 12:01.254
There's a river high in
the mountain that's been

12:01.354 --> 12:03.757
flowing since who knows when.

12:03.857 --> 12:04.691
I like it.

12:04.792 --> 12:06.459
You don't
recognize it, do you?

12:06.559 --> 12:07.660
Nuh-uh.

12:07.761 --> 12:12.833
No? (SINGING) No one's
sure just how it started,

12:12.933 --> 12:16.303
but it's never gonna end.

12:16.403 --> 12:19.940
It's one of your poems.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.474
Gosh, that is.

12:21.574 --> 12:22.709
I can't believe you saved it.

12:22.810 --> 12:24.177
Yeah, I've saved
everything you've

12:24.277 --> 12:28.648
ever written except for a few
notes on the refrigerator door.

12:28.748 --> 12:31.351
That's so sweet.

12:31.451 --> 12:32.719
You like it?

12:32.820 --> 12:33.620
Yeah.

12:33.720 --> 12:34.754
Well, it's half yours.

12:34.855 --> 12:37.891
Maybe if I goose it
up a little bit here.

12:37.991 --> 12:42.896
(SINGING) There's a river high
in the mountains that's been

12:42.996 --> 12:46.699
flowing since who knows when.

12:46.800 --> 12:50.303
No one is sure just
how it started,

12:50.403 --> 12:54.474
but it's never gonna end.

12:54.574 --> 13:02.715
Our love is like that river
flowing through all time.

13:02.816 --> 13:10.123
Heaven knows I need you, and
I'll never change my mind.

13:10.223 --> 13:18.331
Heaven knows how I love you,
and I'll never change my mind.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.235
That was beautiful.

13:22.335 --> 13:23.136
Really?

13:29.476 --> 13:30.277
You like it?

13:30.377 --> 13:31.344
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah?

13:31.444 --> 13:32.245
Yeah.

13:32.345 --> 13:33.380
Think it's good
enough to enter?

13:33.480 --> 13:34.982
I think it's
good enough to win.

13:35.082 --> 13:36.083
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I really do.

13:36.183 --> 13:36.984
Really?

13:37.084 --> 13:38.185
I really, really do.

13:38.285 --> 13:39.920
Hey and, you know, then
when we go out on tour

13:40.020 --> 13:42.155
the kids ain't coming
with us, right?

13:42.255 --> 13:43.056
Right.

13:46.093 --> 13:49.429
[music playing]

13:50.998 --> 13:54.267
Hey, Roseanne, I hear
you and Dan are going to be

13:54.367 --> 13:56.236
big country-western superstars.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.338
Go away, Pete.

13:58.438 --> 13:59.772
Well, you really think
you're going to win

13:59.873 --> 14:00.807
that contest tonight, huh?

14:00.908 --> 14:02.775
Yes, we're going
to win that contest.

14:02.876 --> 14:05.578
Then we're going to snag a great
big old recording contract.

14:05.678 --> 14:08.415
Then we're going to pack up
the kids and move to Nashville.

14:08.515 --> 14:09.382
Yeehaw.

14:09.482 --> 14:10.650
And then me and
Dan are going to buy

14:10.750 --> 14:12.552
these great, big, old,
platinum blonde wigs, you know?

14:12.652 --> 14:14.654
And then I'm going to change all
the kids' middle names to Bob,

14:14.754 --> 14:15.622
you know?

14:15.722 --> 14:17.257
Like Becky-Bob,
Darlene-Bob, DJ-Bob.

14:17.357 --> 14:18.491
Bottom

14:18.591 --> 14:20.827
Well, I'm gonna be
listening to my radio tonight,

14:20.928 --> 14:23.496
so that song better be good.

14:23.596 --> 14:24.965
Go away, Pete.

14:25.065 --> 14:26.900
Crystal, hand me
that thing there.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.368
[screams]

14:28.468 --> 14:30.070
- What, what's wrong?
- Ugh, cockroach.

14:30.170 --> 14:30.870
- Where?
- There!

14:30.971 --> 14:31.905
Kill it!
- You kill it.

14:32.005 --> 14:32.839
I ain't killing it.

14:32.940 --> 14:33.673
It's on your
side of the table.

14:33.773 --> 14:37.177
Come on, Jackie, do something!

14:37.277 --> 14:38.912
There.

14:39.012 --> 14:40.713
Can we go back to work now?

14:43.216 --> 14:44.017
Booker?

14:44.117 --> 14:45.152
Yeah?

14:45.252 --> 14:46.954
Oh, I just killed a big
old cockroach over here,

14:47.054 --> 14:49.522
you better take him
off the payroll.

14:49.622 --> 14:51.224
You gonna do something
about these bugs?

14:51.324 --> 14:53.226
Yeah, I'll talk
to the exterminator.

14:53.326 --> 14:54.794
[ladies woo]

14:55.795 --> 14:57.197
All right, get back to work?

14:57.297 --> 14:58.198
All right?

14:58.298 --> 14:59.199
OK.

14:59.299 --> 15:01.168
[ladies screaming]

15:01.268 --> 15:02.669
All right, that's enough!

15:02.769 --> 15:05.138
Harris, I want to
see you in my office.

15:05.238 --> 15:06.106
Now.

15:06.206 --> 15:08.341
[gasps]

15:08.441 --> 15:11.811
Sis, take the wrench.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.180
Let's go.

15:13.280 --> 15:15.915
Come on.

15:16.016 --> 15:17.050
What do you think you're doing?

15:17.150 --> 15:18.318
What do you call that?
Fun fun?

15:18.418 --> 15:19.252
This is work--

15:19.352 --> 15:20.087
What's the matter
with you getting

15:20.187 --> 15:21.021
so serious about a [inaudible].

15:21.121 --> 15:22.555
--this is a very
serious matter.

15:22.655 --> 15:25.325
Stuff like that could lead
to the unemployment line.

15:25.425 --> 15:28.361
You would quit over that?

15:28.461 --> 15:29.629
Not me, you.

15:29.729 --> 15:33.033
What would I write down
as my reason for dismissal?

15:33.133 --> 15:36.136
Uncontrollable lust.

15:36.236 --> 15:38.205
Booker, you're right.

15:38.305 --> 15:39.439
The dam is crumbling.

15:39.539 --> 15:40.673
I can't fight it any longer.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.042
See, look, you're
going to have to try.

15:42.142 --> 15:44.077
I'm a spontaneous
person, Booker, I

15:44.177 --> 15:45.445
just get these impulses.

15:45.545 --> 15:47.147
Look, I like impulses-- bring
them to my apartment, and it

15:47.247 --> 15:48.215
can do us both some good.

15:48.315 --> 15:48.982
What am I going to
do about the impulse

15:49.082 --> 15:50.217
that I'm having right now?

15:50.317 --> 15:51.218
You're going to have to
control yourself, all right?

15:51.318 --> 15:52.319
I am the boss.

15:52.419 --> 15:53.586
Right, and I
respect that image.

15:53.686 --> 15:54.988
I'm the top guy.
Respect is exactly what I want.

15:55.088 --> 15:56.156
Something happened out there
that should not have happened,

15:56.256 --> 15:57.024
it will never happen again.
- --never happen.

15:57.124 --> 15:57.957
I understand that now.

15:58.058 --> 16:00.493
Glad we had that
understanding.

16:00.593 --> 16:03.096
Roseanne, Booker gave
me his phone number.

16:03.196 --> 16:06.499
[screaming]

16:17.810 --> 16:18.978
Program is getting
ready to start.

16:19.079 --> 16:20.180
I popped you some corn.

16:20.280 --> 16:21.648
Oh, good.

16:21.748 --> 16:22.849
I'm kind of nervous.

16:22.949 --> 16:23.716
How about you?

16:23.816 --> 16:26.586
Oh, my spurs are shaking here.

16:26.686 --> 16:28.121
I know this contest
ain't a big deal,

16:28.221 --> 16:29.956
but it's kind of a big deal.

16:30.057 --> 16:34.661
Oh, ah, my love, soon our
music career will skyrocket.

16:38.431 --> 16:40.433
Yeah, I'm going to have to go
out and dig up some more poems.

16:40.533 --> 16:41.734
What for?

16:41.834 --> 16:43.236
Cause we need some
for the flip side.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.804
Oh, Yeah.

16:44.904 --> 16:46.606
Mom, tell her to
get out of my chair.

16:46.706 --> 16:48.308
DARLENE: Mom, tell
her I was here first.

16:48.408 --> 16:49.709
Mom, tell her she's lying.

16:49.809 --> 16:52.412
DJ, tell your
sisters to shut up.

16:52.512 --> 16:55.248
Shut up.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.016
Thank you, honey.

16:57.117 --> 16:58.185
PHIL (ON RADIO):
Evening everybody.

16:58.285 --> 16:59.652
This is Phil.

16:59.752 --> 17:00.953
DAVE (ON RADIO):
And this is Dave.

17:01.054 --> 17:02.655
PHIL (ON RADIO): And this
is-- (IN UNISON) The Phil

17:02.755 --> 17:03.723
and Dave show.

17:03.823 --> 17:04.924
Here we go, this is it.

17:05.024 --> 17:06.793
Mom, tell her I
had this chair first.

17:06.893 --> 17:08.428
She did not.

17:08.528 --> 17:09.529
DJ.

17:09.629 --> 17:12.432
Shut up.

17:12.532 --> 17:14.934
PHIL (ON RADIO): Before we
announce the winner of WLFDs

17:15.034 --> 17:17.537
songwriting contest,
Dave and I want to thank

17:17.637 --> 17:18.871
all of you who entered.

17:18.971 --> 17:21.308
DAVE (ON RADIO): Yeah boy,
the response was overwhelming.

17:21.408 --> 17:22.442
PHIL (ON RADIO):
We never expected

17:22.542 --> 17:23.743
anything quite like this.

17:23.843 --> 17:27.013
DAVE (ON RADIO): We had a
grand total of four entries.

17:27.114 --> 17:27.880
Four?

17:27.980 --> 17:28.815
I like the odds.

17:28.915 --> 17:30.150
Yeah.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.784
DAVE (ON RADIO): You'd think
that would make our job easy

17:31.884 --> 17:34.621
but with four entries
and only three prizes

17:34.721 --> 17:36.623
I can tell you it was tough.

17:36.723 --> 17:37.890
Just tell us who won.

17:37.990 --> 17:39.559
PHIL (ON RADIO): Well,
Dave, let's get right to it

17:39.659 --> 17:42.028
and announce those winners.

17:42.129 --> 17:44.464
The third place
winner-- winner of two

17:44.564 --> 17:47.267
tickets to the Lanford
Annual Tractor Pull

17:47.367 --> 17:50.937
is Cranston Newhouse.

17:51.037 --> 17:52.239
All right!

17:52.339 --> 17:53.406
One down, two to go.

17:53.506 --> 17:54.507
Did you win yet?

17:54.607 --> 17:55.842
- Not yet.
- Shhh.

17:55.942 --> 17:57.277
PHIL (ON RADIO): The
second prize winner--

17:57.377 --> 17:59.979
winner of an evening for
two at the Lanford Inn is--

18:00.079 --> 18:01.348
Not me, not me, not
me, not me, not me.

18:01.448 --> 18:03.116
I'm so nervous
I can't stand it!

18:03.216 --> 18:05.084
PHIL (ON RADIO): Dorris Fisher.

18:05.185 --> 18:08.455
[cheering]

18:08.555 --> 18:10.957
PHIL (ON RADIO): And
the grand prize winner--

18:11.057 --> 18:13.493
winner of all 100
of those dollars

18:13.593 --> 18:15.195
is a song writing team--

18:15.295 --> 18:18.598
[cheering]

18:18.698 --> 18:19.966
PHIL (ON RADIO):
Dale and Toby Cutler.

18:20.066 --> 18:20.967
Who?

18:21.067 --> 18:22.235
PHIL (ON RADIO):
Congratulations to Frank

18:22.335 --> 18:25.272
and Toby for their
sure-to-be-a-classic tune,

18:25.372 --> 18:27.407
"Daisy's in the Wind."

18:27.507 --> 18:28.308
Well, I guess that's it.

18:28.408 --> 18:29.209
I guess so.

18:29.309 --> 18:30.877
When they gonna
play your song?

18:30.977 --> 18:31.911
They're not.

18:32.011 --> 18:34.113
They didn't like our song.

18:34.214 --> 18:35.982
You mean you didn't win?

18:36.082 --> 18:38.885
Afraid not, buddy.

18:38.985 --> 18:41.688
Aww, you guys should have won.

18:41.788 --> 18:44.724
- Yeah, your song was the best.
- Thanks.

18:44.824 --> 18:46.693
Radio guys are creeps.

18:46.793 --> 18:49.562
Yeah, let's go down
and soap their window.

18:49.662 --> 18:52.131
Yeah, and we can let the
air out of their tires.

18:52.232 --> 18:54.066
And set off smoke bombs.

18:54.167 --> 18:55.502
Oh, you do me proud.

19:00.607 --> 19:02.542
How are ya doing, partner?

19:02.642 --> 19:05.945
Fourth place, partner,
nothing, zero, zip.

19:06.045 --> 19:07.814
We are pathetic.

19:07.914 --> 19:09.282
Let us hang our heads in shame.

19:12.252 --> 19:14.421
How do you explain to
people that your song wasn't

19:14.521 --> 19:17.457
good enough to win two tickets
to the annual Lanford Tractor

19:17.557 --> 19:19.526
Pull?

19:19.626 --> 19:22.495
You don't, you
move out of state.

19:22.595 --> 19:23.863
Montana is nice.

19:23.963 --> 19:26.799
And I hear they have
very little radio there.

19:26.899 --> 19:29.736
Mom, Dad, we're
really sorry you lost.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.638
Well, we didn't really lose.

19:31.738 --> 19:33.506
I mean, the only people
that really ever lose

19:33.606 --> 19:34.841
are people who never try.

19:34.941 --> 19:36.142
At least we tried.

19:36.243 --> 19:39.045
And got crushed.

19:39.145 --> 19:40.547
Oh, stop.

19:40.647 --> 19:42.449
Well, we never got
to hear your song.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.083
Yeah, why don't
you sing it for us?

19:44.183 --> 19:45.352
Dare you?

19:45.452 --> 19:47.687
Well, shuckings, kids.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.055
Why not.

19:49.155 --> 19:54.227
Gather round, young-ins, Pa
is gonna sing us a little ditty.

19:54.327 --> 19:58.698
(SINGING) There's a river
high in the mountain that's been

19:58.798 --> 20:02.068
flowing since who knows when.

20:02.168 --> 20:05.071
No one is sure just
how it started,

20:05.171 --> 20:09.676
but it's never gonna end.

20:09.776 --> 20:16.849
My love is like that river,
flowing through all time.

20:16.949 --> 20:24.056
Heaven knows how I need you,
but I'll never change my mind.

20:24.156 --> 20:32.399
Heaven knows how I love you,
and I'll never change my mind.

20:38.938 --> 20:39.739
Yay!

20:42.775 --> 20:44.277
Hey, Mom, here's one
of your old earrings.

20:44.377 --> 20:48.581
Oh, wow, peace,
love, and sisterhood.

20:48.681 --> 20:49.882
Can't find the other one.

20:49.982 --> 20:51.418
I know, I lost it
at a protest march.

20:51.518 --> 20:53.586
You were at a protest march?

20:53.686 --> 20:57.357
Your mother was at
all the protest marches.

20:57.457 --> 20:58.591
What were you protesting?

20:58.691 --> 21:03.396
Oh, the usual, war,
violence, mass communications.

21:03.496 --> 21:04.697
This is neat.

21:04.797 --> 21:06.599
Oh, that's a mood
ring I bought your mom.

21:06.699 --> 21:08.701
Oh, yeah, back when
I was in a good mood.

21:12.839 --> 21:14.106
Can I have it?

21:14.206 --> 21:15.007
Well--

21:15.107 --> 21:16.343
Can I have this earring?

21:16.443 --> 21:20.947
Well, my daughters,
since you have not maimed,

21:21.047 --> 21:24.617
killed, or abused each
other in the last 24 hours

21:24.717 --> 21:28.821
I will bestow these gifts on
you as a token of my gratitude.

21:28.921 --> 21:29.722
Thanks, Mom.

21:29.822 --> 21:32.191
Yeah, thanks.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.527
Dan, why do we keep
all of this junk?

21:34.627 --> 21:36.262
Maybe we should throw it out.

21:36.363 --> 21:39.466
We can't throw this stuff
out, this is our life.

21:39.566 --> 21:42.435
Yeah.

21:42.535 --> 21:44.437
I think we're in big trouble

21:44.537 --> 21:47.474
