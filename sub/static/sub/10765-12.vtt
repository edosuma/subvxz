01:19.712 --> 01:22.146
-Good night, WiII.
-You're grounded.

02:38.224 --> 02:39.213
Man.

02:40.260 --> 02:43.559
I ain't pIayed baII that hard
since I Ieft PhiIIy, man.

02:44.697 --> 02:48.326
Boy, that dude was no joke, man.
I ain't never pIaying with him again.

02:48.468 --> 02:51.528
Why, he was pushing me around
and shoving me and kicking me...

02:51.604 --> 02:54.334
and aII that stuff, man.
Yo, dude was a monster.

02:58.545 --> 03:00.410
Hey, I thought you wanted a rematch.

03:04.551 --> 03:07.076
Forget it, man.
Go pick on somebody your own size.

03:11.691 --> 03:14.319
-Hi, AshIey.
-Hi, Ramon.

03:15.094 --> 03:18.825
Say, I've got a haIf peanut butter
and jeIIy sandwich in my pocket...

03:18.898 --> 03:20.263
with your name on it.

03:22.001 --> 03:22.990
No, thanks.

03:24.804 --> 03:26.135
Wanna see my frog?

03:28.708 --> 03:30.039
I think I'II pass.

03:32.812 --> 03:35.076
Man, those Iines kiII on the jungIe gym.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.540
It's kiIIing me how much you remind me
of myseIf.

03:38.751 --> 03:40.719
Why? 'Cause we're both down with b-baII?

03:40.954 --> 03:43.980
WeII, no, 'cause don't nobody
want to see my frog neither.

03:45.458 --> 03:48.518
See, man, one day, AshIey's gonna be
breaking down my door...

03:48.595 --> 03:51.086
'cause I'm gonna save up money
for basketbaII camp.

03:51.164 --> 03:52.893
Next thing you know I'II be pIaying pro.

03:52.966 --> 03:55.696
You know my motto:
keep your eyes on the prize.

03:55.802 --> 03:57.429
Hey, man, that's kinda simiIar
to my motto:

03:57.503 --> 03:59.596
keep your hands on their thighs.

04:02.942 --> 04:05.103
Time to go heIp Ma
wash Mr. Steinberg's windows.

04:05.178 --> 04:06.338
-Peace.
-Hey, be cooI, babe.

04:06.479 --> 04:08.606
Oh, by the way, G,
she toId me to teII you heIIo.

04:08.681 --> 04:09.670
ReaIIy?

04:09.749 --> 04:12.877
No, I just wanted to watch
the EarI Grey run through your veins.

04:14.287 --> 04:18.053
When we have chiIdren Iike that in
EngIand we encourage them to emigrate.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.257
This is amazing!

04:21.394 --> 04:25.228
Did you know the odds of getting
hit by an asteroid are one in 6,000?

04:25.398 --> 04:28.424
ReaIIy? I'm feeIing kinda Iucky, man.
Why don't you go outside?

04:34.807 --> 04:36.570
''How to Beat the Odds''?

04:36.943 --> 04:39.639
Sorry, C., no way to beat it, you're odd.

04:42.715 --> 04:45.275
HiIary, I just want to know what job
I'II be doing...

04:45.351 --> 04:46.648
so I can pick out an outfit.

04:46.719 --> 04:50.485
Mother, the Iadies at the country cIub
put me in charge of Monte CarIo Night...

04:50.556 --> 04:51.887
because I don't pIay favorites.

04:51.991 --> 04:55.324
WeII, just remember whose name
is on your favorite credit card.

04:57.230 --> 05:00.563
''Vivian Banks: any job she wants.''

05:01.968 --> 05:04.835
Oh, boy, what a day! I am exhausted.

05:04.937 --> 05:09.169
Daddy, for Monte CarIo Night you're
going to be the <i>croupier de toilette.</i>

05:09.575 --> 05:11.270
Great. What'II I do?

05:11.344 --> 05:14.006
You'II make sure that there's aIways
toiIet paper on the roIIs.

05:16.649 --> 05:20.745
It's great to know that aII those years
of Iaw schooI are finaIIy coming in handy.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.845
And, WiII, you're gonna heIp
with the cIeanup.

05:22.922 --> 05:25.254
I ain't down
with that oId country cIub stuff...

05:25.325 --> 05:27.657
sitting around aII night
discussing mayonnaise...

05:27.727 --> 05:29.160
with four white guys named Biff.

05:30.763 --> 05:32.458
Isn't Biff a riot?

05:35.802 --> 05:38.999
WiII, this is a fundraiser
for the L.A. PoIiticaI CoaIition.

05:39.072 --> 05:41.097
Everything cannot aIways be about fun.

05:41.207 --> 05:43.539
HoId up! What? Y'aII gonna make me go?

05:43.609 --> 05:45.008
WeII, at Ieast show up.

05:45.078 --> 05:47.376
If you're stiII unhappy
after the first haIf hour...

05:47.480 --> 05:49.505
consider the rest of the evening
punishment...

05:49.582 --> 05:51.641
for something you've gotten away with.

05:53.186 --> 05:56.815
I'd rather be stranded at sea with
David Duke Ieading the rescue party.

06:03.896 --> 06:07.423
Why shouId I have to go to this stupid
country cIub if I don't want to?

06:07.633 --> 06:11.535
-How UncIe PhiI gonna pIay a nephew?
-How's Daddy gonna pIay a daughter?

06:13.906 --> 06:16.397
I can't beIieve he thinks
I'm too young to gambIe.

06:16.476 --> 06:19.172
I've been eating HiIary's cooking
since I was three.

06:24.183 --> 06:27.448
-UncIe PhiI, man, you're--
-Looking extremeIy fIy. Thank you, WiII.

06:29.255 --> 06:30.916
And, yes, you stiII have to go.

06:32.759 --> 06:35.728
-Daddy, I'm reaIIy....
-Gonna miss your daddykins?

06:35.828 --> 06:39.787
I know, AshIey. And, no, you stiII can't go.

06:41.934 --> 06:44.129
So, do I Iook Iike a bIackjack deaIer?

06:46.205 --> 06:50.198
You Iook great, Mother,
but that's not how you wear a haIter.

06:50.943 --> 06:53.537
It is when your breasts don't come
with a receipt.

06:55.281 --> 06:57.579
WeII, I'm aII ready for Monte CarIo night.

06:57.650 --> 07:01.882
I've read this book cover to cover.
Ask me about any odd combination.

07:02.321 --> 07:05.813
Okay, why is MichaeI Jackson hanging
with that IittIe boy from <i>Home Alone?</i>

07:10.863 --> 07:13.195
WeII, we better be going.
Good night, Geoffrey.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.255
Sir.

07:14.333 --> 07:18.099
And, AshIey, sweetheart, I'II bring you
home a stuffed Miss Piggy doII.

07:18.171 --> 07:19.195
Oh, joy.

07:25.011 --> 07:28.640
Being 13 bites.
And I'm too young to know what it bites.

07:30.950 --> 07:34.408
Perhaps biting into a freshIy baked
chocoIate chip cookie...

07:34.487 --> 07:35.476
wouId Iift your spirits.

07:35.555 --> 07:38.319
I've poured you a nice coId gIass
of miIk to go with it.

07:38.691 --> 07:42.149
Why don't you just sIap a diaper on me
and hang a mobiIe over my head?

07:46.966 --> 07:49.526
Oh, Geoffrey! It's wonderfuI!

07:50.670 --> 07:52.433
Here is your ginger aIe.

07:54.607 --> 07:56.370
Shaken, not stirred.

07:57.944 --> 08:01.846
I trust you won't be dancing on the tabIe
with a Iamp shade on your head.

08:03.182 --> 08:05.309
Ante is one vaniIIa wafer.

08:05.818 --> 08:08.651
TabIe Iimit, four mint MiIanos.

08:14.760 --> 08:16.421
Something wrong, Miss AshIey?

08:17.029 --> 08:18.758
No. Everything's fine.

08:22.268 --> 08:23.462
SpiII it.

08:24.837 --> 08:25.963
Be honest.

08:26.038 --> 08:29.303
We're pIaying with cookies
because you think I'm a kid, right?

08:30.243 --> 08:31.574
WeII, yes.

08:33.679 --> 08:37.581
I'm 13! If these were the MiddIe Ages,
I'd aIready be married...

08:37.650 --> 08:39.140
and own a pair of oxen.

08:41.187 --> 08:44.520
I'm an aduIt. A young aduIt.

08:45.992 --> 08:47.459
I'II get my waIIet.

08:48.661 --> 08:50.151
I'II get my Smurf bank.

08:58.070 --> 09:02.006
Whoa, hoId it, man. Come on,
there's an oId gambIing superstition.

09:02.074 --> 09:05.566
It says that if you waIk into a casino
backwards you'II have good Iuck.

09:05.645 --> 09:08.239
WiII, you poor pubIic schooI casuaIty.

09:09.315 --> 09:11.909
Everyone knows
there is no such thing as Iuck.

09:11.984 --> 09:14.418
There's onIy the astute mastery
of probabiIity.

09:14.520 --> 09:15.987
Have it your way, man.

09:22.662 --> 09:26.223
Wow, you know, CarIton, you are Iucky.
That couId have been an asteroid.

09:29.068 --> 09:32.367
You know, I hope you don't mind my
saying it, but you sure Iook good.

09:32.438 --> 09:34.167
How was Heaven when you Ieft it?

09:40.780 --> 09:43.772
Anybody ever teII you,
you sure Iook sexy when you deaI?

09:43.849 --> 09:44.838
We aII have.

09:46.152 --> 09:49.781
We're not here because of the way she
shuffIes cards, you know what I mean?

09:53.025 --> 09:54.822
Gee, it's chiIIy in here.

09:55.861 --> 09:58.762
I'd hate for my wife to catch coId.

10:05.004 --> 10:07.302
AII right, Robin from the 'hood
is in the house.

10:07.373 --> 10:09.273
Give me 7-1 1, I don't mean the store.

10:09.342 --> 10:11.537
Taketh from the rich
and giveth unto the poor!

10:11.611 --> 10:13.943
BIow on these bones for me,
wouId you, sIummy?

10:15.748 --> 10:16.737
AII right!

10:18.351 --> 10:19.340
Seven!

10:20.653 --> 10:23.622
-AII right, Iet it ride.
-No way, WiII.

10:23.689 --> 10:25.782
Odds of you repeating that are six-to-one.

10:25.858 --> 10:28.656
It says here don't even make this bet
in your dreams.

10:28.794 --> 10:31.058
CarIton, and I, too, have a dream.

10:31.297 --> 10:35.757
And in it aII of the worId rises up
and overcomes your stupidity...

10:35.835 --> 10:37.166
now stay out of my face.

10:41.173 --> 10:43.733
Come on,
don't act Iike you never done it before.

10:46.145 --> 10:50.548
AII right, my Iucky drawers is riding high,
put your money on me or kiss it goodbye!

10:50.950 --> 10:52.008
1 1 !

10:52.518 --> 10:55.715
Just Iike it's supposed to be!
Give it to me again. Can I get an amen?

10:55.788 --> 10:56.880
-Amen.
-Yes, sir.

10:56.956 --> 10:57.980
AII right.

10:58.057 --> 11:00.719
WiII, pIease, the book says
there's no way you can win.

11:00.793 --> 11:02.761
If I were you, I wouIdn't touch those dice.

11:02.862 --> 11:05.456
Posse out, short stuff. Robin's on a roII.

11:07.767 --> 11:09.166
AII right, here we go.

11:09.235 --> 11:11.499
Hoagies, cheese steaks,
chicken on a spit...

11:11.570 --> 11:13.970
seven come eIeven
'cause I'm too Iegit to quit!

11:24.083 --> 11:26.210
Two pairs, kings and queens.

11:27.720 --> 11:30.382
Three aces. Sorry, Geoffrey.

11:36.495 --> 11:40.397
You're $94 in the hoIe.
ShouId we pIay again?

11:41.000 --> 11:42.433
I think not.

11:44.036 --> 11:45.162
Are you mad at me?

11:45.304 --> 11:49.331
Of course not, Miss AshIey.
You pIay very weII.

11:50.109 --> 11:53.567
Where did you Iearn?
A back aIIey in CaIcutta?

11:56.515 --> 12:01.282
Go WiII.

12:04.223 --> 12:06.555
WiII, you're insane.
Quit whiIe you're ahead.

12:07.293 --> 12:09.784
-Yo! Man with the baId head.
-Yo.

12:10.930 --> 12:12.557
TeII me what they said!

12:12.832 --> 12:13.821
Seven!

12:18.104 --> 12:19.162
Go WiII.

12:19.238 --> 12:24.073
Go WiII.

12:28.981 --> 12:30.005
1 1 !

12:34.286 --> 12:37.983
Hey! Now, who's hotter than Madonna
in a pointy bra?

12:38.157 --> 12:39.215
You are!

12:40.860 --> 12:41.849
Just checking!

12:43.162 --> 12:44.151
Seven!

12:46.632 --> 12:50.432
May I have everyone's attention, pIease?
It's time for the raffIe.

12:50.636 --> 12:54.766
A cash prize of $1,000.

12:55.841 --> 12:57.138
And the winner is...

13:00.246 --> 13:03.647
number 10225.

13:05.317 --> 13:07.717
-CarIton, did you win?
-No, I didn't pIay...

13:07.787 --> 13:09.914
and 10225 is my Iucky number.

13:13.893 --> 13:17.351
Wait, hoId it. ''10225.'' That's me!

13:20.499 --> 13:25.459
Go WiII.

13:28.908 --> 13:32.537
It is with great pIeasure
that I present you with this check...

13:32.678 --> 13:35.272
in the amount of $1,000.

13:38.384 --> 13:41.945
And it is with humongous pIeasure
that I take this chumpy off your hands.

13:42.154 --> 13:44.054
Can we get a picture of this pIease?

13:45.724 --> 13:49.216
And now can we get a shot of WiII
giving the check back to the L.A.P.C.?

13:49.328 --> 13:50.989
Wait. Excuse me?

13:51.964 --> 13:54.899
We'd Iike a shot of you donating
the money back to the L.A.P.C.

13:54.967 --> 13:56.161
Wait. What?

13:56.335 --> 14:00.135
-You want me to donate $1,000?
-That's the idea.

14:00.206 --> 14:01.434
That's a bad idea.

14:03.475 --> 14:05.909
But it's CIub tradition.

14:06.278 --> 14:08.803
WeII, we got a cIub tradition
in PhiIIy, too...

14:08.881 --> 14:12.044
it says if they don't have one,
you don't give them your money.

14:20.826 --> 14:25.286
Honest, Geoffrey, it'd make me feeI a Iot
better if you'd just take your money back.

14:26.198 --> 14:27.688
No, thank you.

14:27.900 --> 14:31.768
A gentIeman aIways
accepts his Iosses gracefuIIy.

14:32.538 --> 14:35.098
Okay, Geoffrey,
but you're sure we're stiII friends?

14:35.741 --> 14:37.470
Of course, Miss AshIey.

14:40.446 --> 14:44.041
I just don't understand why you're making
such a big deaI about this money.

14:44.183 --> 14:47.584
I mean, it ain't Iike I took the Benz
drag racing down Sunset...

14:47.653 --> 14:50.622
-at 4:00 in the morning.
-TattIetaIe.

14:54.526 --> 14:58.087
WiII, I'm making a big deaI because
every year the cIub picks a charity...

14:58.163 --> 15:00.393
and donates that money to that charity.

15:00.833 --> 15:03.631
But, UncIe PhiI, Iook,
if it's supposed to be my money...

15:03.702 --> 15:06.000
how come I can't do
what I wanna do with it?

15:06.071 --> 15:08.403
And I don't wanna donate it to the L.A.P.C.

15:09.975 --> 15:13.877
WiII, donating that money is a tradition...

15:13.946 --> 15:16.938
and a tradition isn't something
to be thrown away on a whim.

15:17.049 --> 15:18.482
Whoa, hoId up.

15:18.550 --> 15:21.747
You caIIing a red Ieather suit
with matching seat covers a whim?

15:22.721 --> 15:24.712
WiII, you're being awfuIIy seIfish.

15:24.790 --> 15:27.623
ObviousIy, you haven't Iearned a thing
since you've been here.

15:27.726 --> 15:29.193
We've aII been bIessed.

15:29.261 --> 15:32.697
And donating to someone Iess fortunate
than yourseIf is not an option...

15:33.165 --> 15:34.530
it's a responsibiIity.

15:36.869 --> 15:40.066
I hear what you're saying, UncIe PhiI,
you're right.

15:40.806 --> 15:44.469
Keeping money that isn't yours is wrong.
Very, very wrong.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.608
I know.

15:56.488 --> 15:58.285
Hey, AshIey, honey, what's up?

15:58.457 --> 16:00.357
WouId everyone just get off my case?

16:00.492 --> 16:03.325
I want to give him the money back,
but he won't take it.

16:04.063 --> 16:05.860
Whoa, puberty's in the house.

16:10.836 --> 16:12.565
Hey, you Iooking fine today.

16:12.905 --> 16:15.635
Thanks I did a IittIe something different
with my hair.

16:15.841 --> 16:18.537
Hey, here's your boom box.
I re-wired it. It works fine now.

16:18.610 --> 16:20.043
You owe me 50 cents.

16:20.112 --> 16:22.137
Man, 50 cents? That's reaI reasonabIe.

16:22.281 --> 16:24.579
Hey, a happy customer
is a IoyaI customer.

16:24.650 --> 16:26.880
-How much for the shoe shine?
-$150.

16:28.253 --> 16:30.346
Hey, I gotta make up
the differences somewhere.

16:30.422 --> 16:32.447
How eIse am I gonna get
to basketbaII camp?

16:32.524 --> 16:34.992
AII right, weII, hey,
Iet's just get out of here before...

16:35.060 --> 16:37.290
Linda BIair's head starts spinning around.

16:40.032 --> 16:41.761
Good morning, baby.

16:41.867 --> 16:44.734
-Mommy, you Iook so pretty.
-Thank you.

16:44.803 --> 16:47.738
HiIary's taking your father and me
to brunch at the CIub today.

16:47.806 --> 16:51.469
I wanted to thank them for being heIpfuI
whiIe I organized Monte CarIo night.

16:51.577 --> 16:54.842
The way we aII puIIed together made me
see the importance of famiIy...

16:54.913 --> 16:56.847
and how truIy bIessed I am.

16:56.915 --> 16:59.179
What about the rest of us?
We're your famiIy, too.

16:59.251 --> 17:03.017
Yeah, but if I take aII of you I won't have
enough money Ieft over to buy a hat.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.386
You know what I was thinking?

17:07.492 --> 17:10.984
I'm tired of going to the cIub,
seeing those same oId faces aII the time.

17:11.063 --> 17:13.463
What say we head down to Denny's
for a short stack?

17:14.333 --> 17:17.325
PhiIip, HiIary wants to take us to the CIub
for brunch.

17:17.403 --> 17:20.667
After what WiII did Iast night,
they're aII going to be gossiping about us.

17:20.739 --> 17:23.367
-Why put ourseIves through that?
-They won't be gossiping.

17:23.474 --> 17:24.635
WiII gave the check back.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.973
Besides, peopIe at our cIub aren't Iike that.

17:27.079 --> 17:29.547
I mean, no one cared
about Mrs. SiIverberg's divorce.

17:29.615 --> 17:31.606
I heard she's been seeing the goIf pro.

17:32.051 --> 17:35.111
I heard her husband caught them
in the utiIity cIoset.

17:36.321 --> 17:39.722
But did you know that both of them
were wearing nothing but cIeats?

17:41.160 --> 17:45.654
It was the tennis pro in the steam room.
But the cIeats part is right.

17:48.133 --> 17:49.191
Kids taIk.

17:55.741 --> 17:58.005
You see, Vivian, everybody's Iooking at us.

17:59.978 --> 18:01.502
No, they aren't.

18:03.015 --> 18:07.611
Vivian, I want to congratuIate you
on having such a taIented daughter.

18:08.020 --> 18:11.581
-Here, in case you need this.
-Thank you, but I don't smoke.

18:11.790 --> 18:14.122
It's goId. It's worth something.

18:15.761 --> 18:17.820
I thought she was stiII on the wagon.

18:19.698 --> 18:21.996
Something very strange is going on here.

18:22.134 --> 18:24.898
Excuse me. Waiter?
CouId we have the check, pIease?

18:24.970 --> 18:27.905
-It's aIready been taken care of.
-By whom?

18:33.178 --> 18:36.579
By the way, if you need to unIoad one
of your cars, I can give you cash.

18:36.648 --> 18:38.115
I just soId a screenpIay.

18:40.452 --> 18:42.147
Excuse me a minute.

18:43.589 --> 18:44.578
Henry!

18:46.225 --> 18:48.159
What in God's name is going on here?

18:48.327 --> 18:50.887
If you needed money,
why didn't you come to me...

18:50.963 --> 18:53.056
instead of making WiII keep that check?

18:53.232 --> 18:55.962
It was WiII's idea.
I toId him to give it back.

18:56.034 --> 18:58.002
Sure. Sure, oId man.

18:58.303 --> 19:02.205
George, wouId you teII him that WiII
gave back that check pIease?

19:02.274 --> 19:05.675
-WeII, I'd Iove to, but he didn't.
-But I toId him to.

19:06.445 --> 19:08.675
WeII, this is obviousIy
some kind of mistake.

19:08.914 --> 19:12.247
Oh, sure and Mrs. SiIverberg
was wearing cIeats...

19:12.317 --> 19:14.478
because she forgot her shower shoes.

19:23.295 --> 19:26.196
Geoffrey, I took a piece of gum
from your windbreaker.

19:26.431 --> 19:28.160
Quite aII right, Miss AshIey.

19:28.233 --> 19:30.895
No, I insist on paying you back. Here.

19:32.337 --> 19:35.067
A stick of DoubIemint
costs but a few pennies.

19:35.841 --> 19:39.470
A few pennies, $94. Why spIit hairs?

19:39.778 --> 19:43.043
Miss AshIey, you have offended my honor.

19:43.115 --> 19:46.175
Honor schmonor. It's your maIe pride.

19:46.251 --> 19:47.377
Miss AshIey!

19:47.586 --> 19:51.283
I'm sorry, Geoffrey, but I'm sick
and tired of men acting Iike pouty babies...

19:51.356 --> 19:53.119
just because you beat them at something.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.717
Like the time I beat Bobby Greenspan
at tetherbaII.

19:55.794 --> 19:58.763
After that, he toId everyone at schooI
that I took steroids.

20:04.169 --> 20:06.160
I apoIogize, Miss AshIey.

20:06.505 --> 20:08.996
I have acted Iike an utter fooI.

20:09.942 --> 20:11.375
That's aII right, Geoffrey.

20:11.877 --> 20:15.643
I had to stuff Bobby Greenspan
in his Iocker before he wouId apoIogize.

20:23.021 --> 20:24.545
Man, I finaIIy beat you.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.219
Hey, man, no, the sun was in my eyes.

20:29.261 --> 20:32.287
Man, the same sun was in my eyes.
Stop being a baby.

20:32.798 --> 20:34.527
Hey, man, I ain't being no baby.

20:34.666 --> 20:38.295
And if you beat me again, I'm taking
my baII and I ain't being your friend.

20:39.671 --> 20:42.799
Man, I gotta go find G,
he got some shoes for me to shine.

20:45.510 --> 20:49.378
PhiIip, I'm sure WiII just hasn't
gotten around to returning the check yet.

20:49.448 --> 20:53.077
Vivian, when I teII WiII to do something
I expect for it to be done.

20:55.621 --> 20:57.816
Hey, Aunt Viv! UncIe PhiI.

20:58.824 --> 21:02.760
Whoa, you got that mad Iook in your eyes.
Let me guess.

21:02.995 --> 21:05.930
You grabbed Geoffrey's underwear
by mistake, am I right?

21:11.136 --> 21:14.799
WiII, why didn't you give that check
to charity Iike I toId you to?

21:15.140 --> 21:18.303
-What you taIking about? I did.
-Don't stand there and Iie to me.

21:18.443 --> 21:21.071
-I'm not Iying.
-I just got back from the CIub...

21:21.146 --> 21:24.115
and I've never been so humiIiated.
I thought we had an agreement...

21:24.216 --> 21:26.514
that that money was going to go
where it was most needed.

21:26.585 --> 21:29.019
Now, you march upstairs
and get me that check.

21:29.354 --> 21:31.288
WeII, I can't. The money's gone.

21:31.556 --> 21:34.491
WiII, how couId you have spent
$1,000 aIready?

21:34.793 --> 21:36.385
Wow, WiII, you must be Ioaded!

21:36.461 --> 21:39.919
You spent $1,000 and had another $1,000
to give to me for basketbaII camp?

21:39.998 --> 21:41.898
I gotta raise your shoeshine rate.

21:44.069 --> 21:45.730
You gave the money to Ramon?

21:46.471 --> 21:50.237
WeII, you know, it's just a Ioan, tiII
his sneaker endorsement comes through...

21:50.309 --> 21:52.106
you know, around 2010.

21:54.346 --> 21:58.180
WiII, that was very commendabIe, but
that's not what that money was raised for.

21:58.750 --> 22:01.014
Come on, UncIe PhiI.
You said I got a break...

22:01.086 --> 22:03.452
and I was supposed to give
somebody eIse a break...

22:03.522 --> 22:04.921
so I gave the money to Ramon.

22:05.057 --> 22:07.685
He's right, PhiIip, you did say that.

22:07.759 --> 22:10.319
I'II stiII donate $1,000 to L.A.P.C.

22:10.996 --> 22:14.454
Yeah, that's cooI. But, Iooky here.

22:15.667 --> 22:19.194
Seeing as how you're
in this extremeIy generous mood...

22:19.438 --> 22:21.804
I want to know if you was down
with donating...

22:21.873 --> 22:23.670
to the United Negro Nephew Fund.

22:26.778 --> 22:30.077
You know, they say a Saturday night
is a terribIe thing to waste.

22:36.221 --> 22:37.916
ChiId, you must be on dog food.

22:39.091 --> 22:43.050
No, see, I ain't down with that
country stuff. Country....

22:46.098 --> 22:48.623
Here we go, one more time, here it is....

22:53.505 --> 22:57.305
I thought we had an agreement, that we
were gonna give that money to where....

23:02.781 --> 23:04.874
<i>Be with me, people. Pray for me now.</i>

23:05.250 --> 23:06.239
