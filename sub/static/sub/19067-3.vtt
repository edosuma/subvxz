01:05.566 --> 01:08.068
[grunting]

01:11.238 --> 01:12.239
Is he okay?

01:12.322 --> 01:16.285
Sometimes, the healing process can
cause involuntary brain wave reactions.

01:16.368 --> 01:18.745
He looks like he's having a bad dream.

01:18.829 --> 01:22.457
He just got blasted by a space witch
and mauled by giant lizards.

01:23.166 --> 01:25.294
What dream could be worse than that?

01:26.586 --> 01:31.049
[Shiro grunting]
No, no! No.

01:31.133 --> 01:34.094
You took my hand.
What more do you want?

01:34.177 --> 01:35.262
[groaning]

01:35.345 --> 01:39.099
Stop! I want him awake enough
to feel this.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.519
[grunting]

01:43.353 --> 01:44.229
[groans]

01:47.357 --> 01:49.776
Listen to me.
We don't have much time.

01:49.860 --> 01:52.237
[Shiro groaning]

01:52.321 --> 01:53.614
[grunts]

01:53.697 --> 01:54.615
Wake up!

01:54.698 --> 01:58.952
Zarkon has located the Blue Lion
of Voltron on your planet, Earth.

01:59.036 --> 02:01.580
You must get it before he does.

02:02.456 --> 02:03.832
What are you doing?

02:03.915 --> 02:07.878
I've planted a bomb to cover your escape.
Get to a pod, now.

02:07.961 --> 02:11.548
-Who are you?
-I am Ulaz. Now, come on!

02:14.176 --> 02:18.138
Zarkon will know that I released you,
so I must disappear.

02:18.221 --> 02:21.767
But, if you survive,
go to the coordinates in your arm.

02:21.850 --> 02:26.063
-The Blade of Marmora is with you.
-Why are you helping me?

02:26.146 --> 02:30.067
As a fighter and a leader,
you give hope.

02:31.068 --> 02:33.278
Hurry! Earth needs you.

02:34.321 --> 02:35.489
We all do.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.742
[breathing heavily]

02:45.582 --> 02:48.126
-[footsteps approaching]
-[gasps]

03:05.227 --> 03:06.436
[screams]

03:19.533 --> 03:21.201
[moaning]

03:21.284 --> 03:22.494
[sighs]

03:29.126 --> 03:32.671
You know I'm innocent!
I would never betray Zarkon!

03:32.754 --> 03:34.840
You're weakening the empire!

03:34.923 --> 03:39.845
You misunderstand. I'm giving you
the opportunity to serve the empire.

03:39.928 --> 03:43.682
You will have the honor
of personally bringing down Voltron.

03:44.558 --> 03:45.684
[screaming]

04:00.866 --> 04:04.578
I'm not finding any coordinates in here.
Are you sure this wasn't just a dream?

04:04.661 --> 04:07.748
I'm positive. Someone helped me escape.

04:07.831 --> 04:10.459
-And he was Galra?
-Yes.

04:10.542 --> 04:15.213
-You know you cannot trust them.
-Your father must have trusted them once.

04:15.297 --> 04:17.798
Zarkon was the original
Black Paladin, wasn't he?

04:18.841 --> 04:21.511
-That was a long time ago.
-Wait, what?

04:21.595 --> 04:24.681
Didn't you see how he stole
the Black Lion right out from Shiro?

04:24.765 --> 04:28.310
Or that he could do all that cool stuff
with his bayard? Shiro's bayard?

04:28.393 --> 04:29.811
You know, the black one?

04:29.895 --> 04:32.898
[Shiro] Why didn't you just tell us
the truth about Zarkon?

04:32.981 --> 04:36.026
I wanted to protect you
from the dark history of the paladins

04:36.109 --> 04:39.404
so that you would have a chance to bond
with your lions on your own.

04:39.488 --> 04:42.616
You are the Black Paladin now,
not Zarkon.

04:43.241 --> 04:46.286
Yeah, well, the Black Lion may have
a different take on the matter.

04:46.369 --> 04:48.663
[Pidge]
Wait a second. I think I see it now.

04:48.747 --> 04:52.834
Some repeating numbers
in all this Galra code. Let me extract it.

04:54.544 --> 04:58.089
They are coordinates!
They lead here: the Thaldycon system.

04:58.173 --> 05:02.010
-Then, that's where we're headed.
-Shiro, are you sure you can trust this?

05:02.093 --> 05:06.389
I mean, after all the Galra have done
to you-- They-- They took your arm.

05:06.473 --> 05:09.935
It's worth the risk.
Someone helped me escape.

05:10.018 --> 05:12.562
If we can locate some allies
in our fight against Zarkon,

05:12.646 --> 05:14.940
especially ones from his own side,

05:15.023 --> 05:17.150
we might just find a way
to take him down.

05:17.234 --> 05:20.529
We can check the location,
but I do not like this.

05:20.612 --> 05:22.614
The Galra are not to be trusted.

05:29.663 --> 05:33.959
[Coran] <i>Well, this is it. No sign of</i>
<i>any activity at all, living or otherwise.</i>

05:34.042 --> 05:36.211
[Shiro] <i>Can we get in there</i>
<i>to take a closer look?</i>

05:36.294 --> 05:38.255
[Coran] <i>I don't want to bring</i>
<i>the Castle any closer.</i>

05:38.338 --> 05:41.841
Those xanthorium chunks contain
highly unstable nitrate salts.

05:41.925 --> 05:44.427
Even bumping one of them
can blow us straight to <i>Wozblay.</i>

05:44.511 --> 05:46.263
Are you sure this is right?

05:46.346 --> 05:48.348
These are the coordinates
Number Five gave me.

05:48.431 --> 05:52.060
-Hey! My decryption is solid.
-There must be something we're missing.

05:52.143 --> 05:53.353
We should get out of here.

05:53.436 --> 05:55.897
We've checked it out,
but now, it's time to move on.

05:55.981 --> 06:00.610
No. There must be something
more to this. I can feel it.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.529
I think we should wait.

06:04.906 --> 06:10.996
Sire, Prorok's transformation is complete.
We only need to know where to send him.

06:22.757 --> 06:27.137
Now, reach out with your mind!

06:37.272 --> 06:38.398
[groans]

06:40.525 --> 06:44.237
I have the coordinates
to launch the beast.

06:47.991 --> 06:49.117
[alarm blaring]

06:49.200 --> 06:51.244
There's an intruder in the Castle!

06:51.328 --> 06:53.330
How could someone
just sneak aboard the ship?

06:53.413 --> 06:55.624
I knew coming here was a mistake!

06:58.710 --> 07:02.589
-There he is. Level five.
-Everyone, suit up.

07:11.056 --> 07:12.933
[panting]

07:15.310 --> 07:16.311
I got him.

07:16.394 --> 07:18.563
[Shiro] <i>Keep eyes on him, Lance.</i>
<i>We're all headed toward you.</i>

07:21.858 --> 07:23.234
Hold it right there!

07:27.572 --> 07:29.991
[Coran] <i>Careful, he's faster</i>
<i>than an angry </i> klanmüirl!

07:31.826 --> 07:34.329
<i>But he can jump</i>
<i>like a sprightly </i> globinheffer!

07:34.412 --> 07:35.705
Coran, you're not helping!

07:36.748 --> 07:39.334
<i>Somebody's as mad as a wet </i> chüper <i>.</i>

07:39.417 --> 07:41.711
<i>Coming your way, Number Five!</i>

07:51.054 --> 07:52.180
I got him!

07:54.182 --> 07:55.725
I don't got him!

07:56.768 --> 07:59.938
-<i>He's dragging Pidge away!</i>
-Come back here!

08:00.063 --> 08:01.356
Huh?

08:02.232 --> 08:05.110
-[grunting] Hunk!
-Huh? Sorry!

08:05.193 --> 08:08.446
-<i>Oh, Hunk failed the team, guys.</i>
-Hey!

08:08.530 --> 08:12.325
-<i>All right, it's up to Keith now.</i>
-Copy that. I'm ready.

08:13.201 --> 08:15.620
<i>Ooh, this is exciting! He's got a sword.</i>

08:15.704 --> 08:18.748
<i>One young paladin,</i>
<i>one seemingly indestructible foe...</i>

08:20.417 --> 08:22.460
[Pidge screaming]

08:22.544 --> 08:25.338
[screaming continues]

08:27.173 --> 08:29.968
<i>Swing and a miss!</i>
<i>Oh, another swing and a miss!</i>

08:30.051 --> 08:32.345
<i>He can't touch him! He's too fast!</i>

08:33.471 --> 08:34.764
[grunting]

08:39.477 --> 08:41.813
[grunting]

08:47.193 --> 08:50.196
<i>He knocked his bayard out of his hands!</i>
<i>It's on the ground!</i>

08:50.280 --> 08:52.532
-[grunting]
-[screaming]

08:52.615 --> 08:53.867
[both groan]

08:59.789 --> 09:00.749
[all grunt]

09:23.605 --> 09:24.939
Ulaz?

09:25.565 --> 09:27.776
-[grunts]
-Who are you?

09:27.859 --> 09:31.279
Stop! It's him!
This is the Galra who set me free.

09:32.530 --> 09:33.740
You've come.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.912
[Shiro]
I don't think this is necessary.

09:38.995 --> 09:43.333
I will not have some <i>quiznak-</i> ing
Galra soldier on the bridge of my ship!

09:43.416 --> 09:47.253
If I wanted to kill you,
you'd be dead already.

09:47.337 --> 09:49.964
Are your Galra threats
supposed to win my trust?

09:50.590 --> 09:55.386
I'm not trying to win your trust.
I'm trying to win a war.

09:55.470 --> 09:58.598
And, because of Shiro,
we are closer than we've ever been.

09:58.681 --> 10:02.769
Our gamble on you paid off better
than we could have ever imagined.

10:02.852 --> 10:06.314
When you released me, you also mentioned
that there were others working with you.

10:06.397 --> 10:10.652
Yes. We are called the Blade of Marmora.

10:10.735 --> 10:13.822
Uh, others? Are they here?

10:13.905 --> 10:17.033
Hunk, can you try not to act so scared
around the chained-up prisoner?

10:17.117 --> 10:18.868
It makes us seem a little lame.

10:18.952 --> 10:22.747
-I am alone on this base.
-What is this base you're talking about?

10:22.831 --> 10:26.000
Shiro's coordinates just led us
to this wasteland.

10:26.084 --> 10:27.794
The base is hidden.

10:27.877 --> 10:32.507
Now that I know it is Shiro that has come,
you are welcome to our outpost.

10:32.590 --> 10:37.387
-It lies dead ahead.
-Behind all the xanthorium clusters?

10:37.470 --> 10:42.600
No. Right in front of it,
in a hidden pocket of space-time.

10:43.309 --> 10:44.769
Coran, are you hearing this?

10:45.937 --> 10:48.273
I am picking up some kind
of anomaly on the screen.

10:48.356 --> 10:50.066
I suppose it could be a cloaked base.

10:50.150 --> 10:55.071
Just fly straight for the center
of the xanthorium cluster. You will see.

10:55.155 --> 10:59.200
You think you're going to get me to
destroy our ship just because you say so?

10:59.284 --> 11:03.621
We came out here to find some answers.
Are we going to turn back now?

11:03.705 --> 11:07.167
You know I trust you, Shiro,
but this doesn't feel right.

11:07.250 --> 11:11.296
And you know I hate to agree with Keith,
but it's a big fat ditto for me.

11:11.921 --> 11:14.799
Galra could have implanted
fake memories of the escape in your head.

11:14.883 --> 11:18.845
Oh, come on, that would be so evil,
which, of course, they are.

11:18.928 --> 11:21.681
But they'd have to come up
with some molecular level storage unit,

11:21.764 --> 11:24.058
which his hand does have.

11:24.142 --> 11:25.727
But, to be linked up to memory,

11:25.810 --> 11:29.939
it would need a direct pathway
to his brain, which... yeah.

11:30.023 --> 11:33.985
Ulaz freed me.
Without him, we wouldn't be here.

11:39.032 --> 11:44.203
Fine. Slow and steady, Coran.
Head for the xanthorium cluster.

11:44.287 --> 11:47.123
Yes, Princess. Beginning approach.

11:49.042 --> 11:53.379
-[alarm blaring]
-Impact imminent in five, four...

11:53.463 --> 11:56.132
three, two...

11:59.719 --> 12:00.929
Well, that's something.

12:01.012 --> 12:03.264
-[Allura] <i>What is it?</i>
-Putting it up on the screens.

12:05.183 --> 12:08.728
Amazing. They're folding space.

12:09.687 --> 12:13.191
It's like a space taco.
Or a space calzone.

12:13.274 --> 12:16.235
Or a space-time soup dumpling
and we're the soup.

12:16.319 --> 12:18.071
Hey, is there a cafeteria on this thing?

12:22.700 --> 12:26.746
[Ulaz] <i>Welcome to the Blade of Marmora</i>
<i>Communications Base Thaldycon.</i>

12:28.748 --> 12:32.961
Now, if you'll free me, I need to send
a message to the leadership.

12:33.044 --> 12:36.089
They need to know
I've made contact with Voltron.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.299
Go with him and keep an eye on him.

12:38.383 --> 12:40.301
-I'm staying here.
-Ooh! Can we go?

12:40.385 --> 12:42.261
I want to see how they make
the space pocket!

12:42.345 --> 12:45.556
You guys go ahead. I'll hang back
and protect the princess.

12:45.640 --> 12:46.933
Ugh...

12:53.815 --> 12:57.026
[Ulaz] <i>This is the gravity generator</i>
<i>that creates the space-time fold</i>

12:57.110 --> 12:58.611
<i>that hides the station.</i>

12:59.445 --> 13:03.324
It was created by a reclusive
genius engineer named Slav.

13:03.408 --> 13:06.786
His technology allows
the Blade of Marmora to remain hidden

13:06.869 --> 13:09.455
while we work to take down
the Galra Empire.

13:09.539 --> 13:13.251
Zarkon would do anything
to get his hands on this technology.

13:13.334 --> 13:16.337
There are Galra out there
that aren't loyal to Zarkon?

13:16.421 --> 13:20.842
[Ulaz] <i>We thought expanding</i>
<i>the Galra Empire would bring stability.</i>

13:20.925 --> 13:26.639
We learned too late, a tyrant
doesn't seek stability, only power.

13:29.434 --> 13:34.605
With our members working on the inside,
planning coordinated attacks with Voltron,

13:34.689 --> 13:37.316
we may finally have a chance.

13:38.317 --> 13:41.738
So, you have agents working
within Zarkon's ranks?

13:41.821 --> 13:45.575
How do you think you got away
from Zarkon in that last fight?

13:45.658 --> 13:50.580
Do you think those shields around Zarkon's
command center went down on their own?

13:50.663 --> 13:54.792
We've got people risking their lives
in this war, just like you.

13:54.876 --> 13:58.254
If you have people on the inside,
can they tell me where my family is?

13:58.337 --> 14:03.051
-They were taken the same time Shiro was.
-I knew others from Earth were captured.

14:03.134 --> 14:08.097
I never saw them, but I have some records
of Galra prisoners here.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.183
I can transmit them to your ship.

14:11.934 --> 14:13.853
What's that weapon you carry?

14:14.479 --> 14:18.858
It's a ceremonial blade
that each member of our order carries.

14:19.484 --> 14:21.361
Hmm, nice.

14:21.444 --> 14:22.528
-[alarm blaring]
-Huh?

14:24.405 --> 14:25.490
[Ulaz] Oh, no!

14:30.745 --> 14:32.163
You were tracked!

14:32.246 --> 14:34.248
What? Us?

14:34.332 --> 14:37.960
If Zarkon knows we're here,
it's because you ratted us out.

14:46.886 --> 14:51.099
It's another one of Zarkon's
robot... beast... ro-beasts!

14:51.182 --> 14:54.060
-We have to get back to the ship.
-Shiro, wait.

14:54.143 --> 14:58.314
These are instructions on how to reach
the Blade of Marmora headquarters.

14:58.398 --> 15:02.318
Before you go there,
find out how Zarkon is tracking you.

15:02.402 --> 15:05.613
If you lead him there,
our entire underground network,

15:05.696 --> 15:09.409
everything we've spent
centuries building, will be lost.

15:12.787 --> 15:14.622
I knew he cannot be trusted!

15:14.705 --> 15:17.208
-<i>It wasn't him.</i>
-How can you be sure?

15:17.291 --> 15:19.877
It doesn't matter now.
What should we do?

15:19.961 --> 15:22.922
Why can't we hide here in the space clam
and wait for it to go away?

15:23.005 --> 15:25.299
Everyone get to your lions,
but don't launch.

15:25.383 --> 15:26.968
We'll wait to see what it does.

15:27.051 --> 15:29.429
<i>I don't want to risk fighting it</i>
<i>if we don't have to.</i>

15:40.898 --> 15:43.359
[Pidge] <i>We should be safe as long</i>
<i>as we're hidden in the space pocket.</i>

15:53.494 --> 15:55.496
He's drawing in the xanthorium clusters.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.137
[rapid beeping]

16:14.807 --> 16:16.851
I think he knows we're here.

16:16.934 --> 16:17.977
Hold...

16:23.399 --> 16:25.526
[Coran] <i>Direct hit!</i>
<i>He definitely knows we're here!</i>

16:25.610 --> 16:27.570
Get the particle barrier up!

16:40.458 --> 16:42.084
[Coran]
<i>He's readying another attack!</i>

16:43.586 --> 16:45.755
[Allura]
<i>He's pulling us in as well!</i>

16:45.838 --> 16:48.466
Paladins, I think it's time to launch!

16:48.549 --> 16:50.426
Form Voltron!

17:02.855 --> 17:05.608
[Allura] <i>We're exposed!</i>
<i>The space fold has been lowered!</i>

17:07.318 --> 17:09.111
[Coran]
Well, there goes Ulaz.

17:09.779 --> 17:11.781
I knew we should never trust a Galra!

17:19.579 --> 17:22.916
[Shiro]
Let's light this thing up. Fire lasers!

17:28.714 --> 17:29.840
-Huh?
-Huh?

17:37.265 --> 17:39.058
[Pidge]
He's pulling in more ammo!

17:39.475 --> 17:40.726
[Shiro]
Move, move, move!

17:48.526 --> 17:50.194
[all yelling]

17:55.658 --> 17:58.327
[Shiro] Lance, Hunk,
give me full reverse boosters!

18:12.550 --> 18:15.344
This thing wants to eat us
like we're a space taco!

18:20.600 --> 18:22.810
[Shiro]
Can't get free!

18:23.436 --> 18:24.854
I'll make him back off!

18:32.612 --> 18:35.531
[Shiro] We've got to keep some distance
between us and that ro-beast!

18:54.550 --> 18:56.385
[Hunk]
It's trying to pull us in again!

19:00.640 --> 19:03.684
I'm burning thrusters at full capacity
and it's not making any difference!

19:06.604 --> 19:07.772
[all grunt]

19:10.524 --> 19:15.655
-Is everyone all right?
<i>-Alive, yes. All right, no.</i>

19:20.576 --> 19:21.994
It's going for the Castle!

19:22.078 --> 19:23.913
We need some way
to stop its tractor beam!

19:23.996 --> 19:26.916
I've got an idea. Pidge, form shield!

19:31.212 --> 19:33.255
We can use the shield
to block the beam!

19:38.928 --> 19:42.556
-We stopped the beam. Now, what?
-Now, we go on the offensive.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.850
The xanthorium clusters!
We can use them!

20:16.257 --> 20:17.883
[all yelling]

20:18.509 --> 20:20.761
[Pidge]
The shield can't handle this much power!

20:35.067 --> 20:37.486
<i>We might not be strong enough</i>
<i>to beat this thing!</i>

20:37.570 --> 20:39.530
-[Ulaz] <i>Hang on!</i>
-Ulaz?

20:41.323 --> 20:43.909
I'm going to take it down from the inside!

20:43.993 --> 20:46.328
[Shiro]
<i>Ulaz, no! Let us handle this!</i>

20:46.412 --> 20:50.374
Voltron is too valuable.
The universe needs you.

21:02.428 --> 21:03.387
[all gasp]

21:03.512 --> 21:04.722
[Shiro]
Get ready!

21:10.311 --> 21:15.024
[Pidge] <i>Ulaz opened up the space pocket</i>
<i>from inside! It's falling in on itself!</i>

21:27.745 --> 21:30.206
-He did it!
-Ulaz saved us.

21:31.332 --> 21:33.209
He's... gone.

21:42.676 --> 21:46.597
Sorry we doubted Ulaz, Shiro.
He saved all our lives.

21:46.680 --> 21:49.058
I still have so many questions.

21:49.141 --> 21:50.434
[doors opening]

21:50.518 --> 21:52.812
Do you think Zarkon is really tracking us?

21:52.895 --> 21:57.399
We cannot know for sure.
Only Ulaz knew our whereabouts.

21:57.483 --> 22:02.321
You don't really think Ulaz gave us up?
After he sacrificed himself?

22:02.404 --> 22:05.741
Yeah! Maybe Zarkon found out
about this place on his own.

22:05.825 --> 22:08.244
He's probably been searching
for the Blade of Marmora.

22:09.537 --> 22:12.832
It's clear the loss of Ulaz
has caused you great concern,

22:12.915 --> 22:17.211
but, regardless of how Zarkon located us,
we cannot stay here any longer.

22:17.294 --> 22:18.629
It isn't safe.

22:18.712 --> 22:22.508
We should meet up with the rest
of Ulaz's group, finish what we started.

22:22.591 --> 22:27.054
No. We're not going to the headquarters
until we figure out how Zarkon found us.

22:27.137 --> 22:30.599
We can't risk losing the only allies
we have in this war.
