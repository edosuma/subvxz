11:24.739 --> 11:28.434
Doesn't matter where you're
from, Luke-- family's family.

11:28.478 --> 11:31.434
People are dead
because of me.

11:31.478 --> 11:33.869
You didn't kill anybody.

11:33.913 --> 11:36.086
You're trying to help now.

11:36.130 --> 11:38.652
That counts for something.

11:38.695 --> 11:42.478
An agent died.

11:42.521 --> 11:44.652
Yeah.

11:44.695 --> 11:48.000
And The Calling is responsible.

11:50.478 --> 11:52.608
What if...

11:52.652 --> 11:55.608
I could show you...

11:55.652 --> 11:59.521
exactly who killed my parents?

12:02.913 --> 12:05.043
Meet Safari Sandy.

12:05.086 --> 12:07.304
Safari Sandy's a giraffe.

12:07.347 --> 12:09.521
Yes. A distant relative of Bert

12:09.565 --> 12:13.652
the Hippo and a direct result
of the Harrises' paranoia

12:13.695 --> 12:16.173
regarding a certain
sticky-fingered cleaning lady.

12:16.217 --> 12:17.521
Nanny cam.

12:17.565 --> 12:18.826
Yep. Exactly.

12:18.869 --> 12:21.739
Hence Safari Sandy's
unfortunate exenteration.

12:21.782 --> 12:23.347
Eyeball removal.

12:23.391 --> 12:25.434
I did not see a giraffe
at the crime scene.

12:25.478 --> 12:27.347
That's the point.

12:27.391 --> 12:29.956
Safari Sandy
is a stuffed animal,

12:30.000 --> 12:32.521
so is decidedly nonthreatening

12:32.565 --> 12:34.130
in her stuffed-ness.

12:34.173 --> 12:36.000
The camera has
a motion sensor.

12:36.043 --> 12:38.173
So whenever there's movement,
it starts recording,

12:38.217 --> 12:41.826
and then the files are sent
to an internal SD card.

12:41.869 --> 12:44.434
Yeah. Good. Put it up.

12:44.478 --> 12:48.043
Gibbs, the camera's
motion sensors

12:48.086 --> 12:50.043
caught something that night.

12:51.826 --> 12:53.913
The Harrises' murder.

12:53.956 --> 12:56.565
The camera
recorded everything,

12:56.608 --> 12:59.608
including the identity
of the killer.

12:59.652 --> 13:01.565
Play it, Abbs. Go.

13:06.130 --> 13:08.173
MRS. HARRIS [gasps]:
Who are you?

13:08.217 --> 13:10.739
MR. HARRIS: Hey! Hey!
What are you doing in our house?

13:10.782 --> 13:12.304
You don't have to--
put the gun down.

13:12.347 --> 13:13.608
Put the gun down-- no!
Put it...

13:13.652 --> 13:15.086
-[gunfire]
-MRS. HARRIS: Oh, my God!

13:15.130 --> 13:16.347
[sobbing]:
No!

13:16.391 --> 13:19.434
[Mrs. Harris sobbing, gasping]

13:19.478 --> 13:20.869
[gunshot]

13:25.086 --> 13:28.347
[shuddering sigh]

13:30.086 --> 13:31.434
Oh. Sorry.

13:31.478 --> 13:33.391
I didn't know
someone was in here.

13:33.434 --> 13:35.347
No, it's okay.

13:35.391 --> 13:37.695
I, um, left my
homework on the table.

13:37.739 --> 13:39.826
I just need to
get it. I'll...

13:39.869 --> 13:42.913
You must be Luke.

13:51.521 --> 13:53.434
Who's that?

13:53.478 --> 13:55.086
That's my son.

13:55.130 --> 13:58.608
He worked here, but, uh...

13:58.652 --> 14:01.000
he's gone now.

14:01.043 --> 14:04.304
The agent who was killed.

14:04.347 --> 14:05.739
What was his name?

14:05.782 --> 14:07.782
Ned.

14:07.826 --> 14:10.391
You know,

14:10.434 --> 14:13.347
you kind of remind me of him
a little bit.

14:15.913 --> 14:20.086
Look, the-the agents won't tell
me what happened exactly, and...

14:20.130 --> 14:23.869
I have so many questions.

14:24.869 --> 14:27.826
It's kind of my fault.

14:27.869 --> 14:31.478
My parents, uh,

14:31.521 --> 14:34.130
your son...

14:34.173 --> 14:38.347
they're all gone now, and
I didn't do anything to stop it.

14:38.391 --> 14:40.043
You didn't kill them, Luke.

14:40.086 --> 14:42.521
I know, but I...

14:42.565 --> 14:45.652
Look, I better go.

14:45.695 --> 14:47.260
Luke...

14:47.304 --> 14:49.391
Luke, please.

14:49.434 --> 14:52.173
Tell me about your friends.

14:53.130 --> 14:55.869
They're not my friends.

14:56.913 --> 15:00.347
Then tell me how to find them.

15:03.391 --> 15:05.739
Titanium is generally preferred
because it's lightweight

15:05.782 --> 15:08.217
and can withstand high
compression and temperature.

15:08.260 --> 15:09.521
Uh, the precision finish

15:09.565 --> 15:12.956
ensures surface uniformity.
No pits.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.608
Don't want pits.

15:14.652 --> 15:16.869
We mostly use these
in aircraft landing gear.

15:16.913 --> 15:19.652
I order 'em by the bushel.That's why we're here.

15:19.695 --> 15:22.565
One of your bushels ended up
in Cairo, Egypt.

15:22.608 --> 15:24.521
How's that, now?

15:24.565 --> 15:27.739
BISHOP:
Well, you signed the P.O.

15:27.782 --> 15:29.913
for the bearings used
in these devices.

15:29.956 --> 15:33.043
TONY: Devices used in this
bombing in Cairo, Egypt.

15:33.086 --> 15:36.043
No, ma'am.
I-I did no such thing.

15:36.086 --> 15:38.739
The inventory you just admitted
to controlling was sold

15:38.782 --> 15:40.217
to a dummy corp

15:40.260 --> 15:42.043
fronting
Sadiq Samar,

15:42.086 --> 15:44.695
the terrorist responsible
for the bombing.

15:45.782 --> 15:47.391
Oh, God.

15:47.434 --> 15:48.869
I, uh...

15:48.913 --> 15:50.869
I don't know anything

15:50.913 --> 15:52.304
about any, uh...

15:52.347 --> 15:55.086
All our inventory
is carefully accounted for.

15:55.130 --> 15:56.391
Clearly.

15:56.434 --> 15:57.739
So will we find anything

15:57.782 --> 15:59.826
when we go
through your personal accounts?

15:59.869 --> 16:01.739
TONY:
You didn't just put
in a new pool, did you?

16:01.782 --> 16:04.869
For the fam, Roger? You seem
like a kidney-shaped guy to me.

16:05.913 --> 16:08.347
You won't find anything.

16:08.391 --> 16:10.782
Are you calling my bluff, Roger?

16:10.826 --> 16:14.521
Because that would take
big brass ones.

16:16.565 --> 16:19.913
GIBBS:
Titanium ball bearings made
in Russia.

16:19.956 --> 16:21.869
Sold,
under the table,

16:21.913 --> 16:24.521
by a guy at Bianca Aviation

16:24.565 --> 16:27.304
to this clown.

16:27.347 --> 16:29.304
You know him?

16:29.347 --> 16:31.739
He killed some good people.

16:31.782 --> 16:34.478
Navy Ensign Wilt.

16:34.521 --> 16:37.478
Luke Harris's parents.

16:37.521 --> 16:42.173
Hell, we even linked him
to the bombing in Egypt.

16:42.217 --> 16:46.956
You know,
we've been at this a while.

16:47.000 --> 16:51.478
I'm in no rush.

16:51.521 --> 16:54.565
And I know you are made of time.

16:56.565 --> 17:00.956
Luke is a...
misguided young man.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.956
Pity.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.043
He'll find his way.

17:05.086 --> 17:08.260
Mmm.

17:08.304 --> 17:10.260
Maybe.

17:10.304 --> 17:13.260
Tell me who this is.

17:13.304 --> 17:14.695
Don't know.

17:14.739 --> 17:17.173
Never seen him before
in my life.

17:17.217 --> 17:19.130
Where would I find him?

17:19.173 --> 17:23.130
Second star to the right
and straight on till morning.

17:23.173 --> 17:26.652
Why use kids?

17:26.695 --> 17:30.043
Why do fish swim?

17:30.086 --> 17:33.043
For the same reason
disenfranchised children

17:33.086 --> 17:35.434
will rise up
to find their purpose.

17:35.478 --> 17:37.652
They simply must.

17:37.695 --> 17:39.652
It is inevitable.

17:39.695 --> 17:41.217
FRANKS:
Listen to him,

17:41.260 --> 17:43.217
talkin' in circles.

17:43.260 --> 17:45.043
He's scum.

17:45.086 --> 17:48.130
People are dying. Good people.

17:48.173 --> 17:51.260
Your people. And this
one thinks it's funny.

17:51.304 --> 17:53.869
Look at that smirk.

17:53.913 --> 17:55.173
Break him.

17:55.217 --> 17:57.304
Do it.

17:57.347 --> 17:59.739
One name.

17:59.782 --> 18:02.347
One name.

18:02.391 --> 18:05.652
Who is he?

18:05.695 --> 18:11.043
These Western time zones
elude me.

18:11.086 --> 18:14.130
What time is it in Arizona?

18:16.130 --> 18:19.565
I think
we've missed the afternoon tour.

18:19.608 --> 18:22.000
[phone rings]

18:24.695 --> 18:26.478
What, McGee?

18:26.521 --> 18:29.043
McGEE: South rim
of the Grand Canyon, boss.

18:29.086 --> 18:32.043
Two more Bouncing Bettys.
It's all over the news.

18:46.217 --> 18:47.695
NEWSCASTER: The National Park
Service is working

18:47.739 --> 18:49.521
with Homeland Security
and the FBI

18:49.565 --> 18:51.304
to determine who was responsible

18:51.347 --> 18:53.739
for today's deadly attack
at the Grand Canyon.

18:53.782 --> 18:56.695
No further details
have been released.

18:56.739 --> 18:58.086
That's enough.

18:58.130 --> 18:59.652
Why in a national park?

18:59.695 --> 19:01.043
Why in the middle of nowhere?

19:01.086 --> 19:03.391
Okay, Bouncing Bettys
are confirmed.

19:03.434 --> 19:05.086
One park ranger dead,

19:05.130 --> 19:07.956
three hikers wounded.
But five minutes later,

19:08.000 --> 19:09.347
two tour buses
would have unloaded

19:09.391 --> 19:10.782
right where the bombs went off.

19:10.826 --> 19:13.086
Our friend at Bianca Aviation

19:13.130 --> 19:16.043
had a cell number for Sadiq
in his phone records.

19:16.086 --> 19:18.000
You track it?Burn phone was found

19:18.043 --> 19:20.826
in a Dumpster in Maryland,
near the Mount Roosevelt campus.

19:20.869 --> 19:22.608
Makes sense.

19:22.652 --> 19:24.043
A bright 20-something engineer

19:24.086 --> 19:26.304
hiding in plain sight
on a college campus.

19:26.347 --> 19:28.434
BISHOP: Cell's battery
was still working.

19:28.478 --> 19:30.434
He probably tossed it
recently.
Go. Find him.

19:30.478 --> 19:32.217
McGee.

19:32.260 --> 19:34.043
Boss, I-I found something

19:34.086 --> 19:36.739
that Dorney never got the-the
chance to follow through on.

19:36.782 --> 19:39.086
All the kids that were recruited
online were sent

19:39.130 --> 19:40.260
the same group of songs.

19:40.304 --> 19:44.043
[music playing]

19:44.086 --> 19:45.782
Dance club music.

19:45.826 --> 19:47.217
It's, uh, techno-industrial,

19:47.260 --> 19:48.478
to be specific.
But, uh,

19:48.521 --> 19:49.869
I don't know exactly
where they come from.

19:49.913 --> 19:51.043
I'm still digging.

19:51.086 --> 19:52.782
Do us a favor, McGee,

19:52.826 --> 19:54.434
dig with headphones.

19:56.391 --> 19:59.043
Luke carries an MP3 player,
right?

19:59.086 --> 20:00.043
Yeah.

20:00.086 --> 20:02.043
I'm just saying, Gibbs,

20:02.086 --> 20:05.086
in the morning, let's see if
he has any songs like these.

20:05.130 --> 20:06.434
It could mean
something.

20:14.043 --> 20:17.043
Well, she seemed friendly.

20:17.086 --> 20:19.826
Anything?Uh, her name is Amber.

20:19.869 --> 20:21.826
She's a criminal justice major,

20:21.869 --> 20:23.652
she has daddy issues,

20:23.695 --> 20:26.000
and she wanted to discuss my
search-and-seizure techniques.

20:26.043 --> 20:28.000
[laughing]:
She did not.

20:28.043 --> 20:30.173
You made all that up.No.

20:30.217 --> 20:31.304
I did not.

20:31.347 --> 20:32.260
Anyway, she hasn't
seen Sadiq,

20:32.304 --> 20:34.608
and we have been
to every 24-hour

20:34.652 --> 20:37.173
study hall on campus. So I think
it's time to call it a night.

20:37.217 --> 20:39.304
Hang on a second.

20:39.347 --> 20:42.739
Hey. Excuse me. Hi.

20:44.086 --> 20:45.260
Sorry, but how old are you?

20:45.304 --> 20:47.173
Eighteen.

20:47.217 --> 20:48.260
Mm. No, you're not.

20:48.304 --> 20:50.826
You're, what, 16, tops?

20:50.869 --> 20:52.565
What are you doing here?
It's a school day.

20:52.608 --> 20:54.304
Visiting a friend.

20:54.347 --> 20:57.260
Uh, my brother.
He-he goes to college here.

20:57.304 --> 21:00.173
Ah. So which is it, Doogie,
brother or friend?

21:00.217 --> 21:02.391
What's your name?

21:03.913 --> 21:04.956
You seen this guy?

21:08.739 --> 21:10.260
Kids are fast.

21:10.304 --> 21:11.260
TONY:
Hey!

21:14.913 --> 21:17.608
[engine revving]

21:19.086 --> 21:22.130
[tires screeching,
horn honking]

21:22.173 --> 21:24.173
[panting]

21:27.913 --> 21:30.913
Mmm. Food's getting cold, dude.

21:30.956 --> 21:33.130
I'm not hungry.

21:33.173 --> 21:34.521
GIBBS:
Suit yourself.

21:34.565 --> 21:36.826
You know
what I could use later?

21:36.869 --> 21:38.347
Ice cream.

21:39.695 --> 21:41.826
Is Larry's still
on Connecticut Avenue?

21:41.869 --> 21:43.260
GIBBS:
Yeah.

21:43.304 --> 21:44.521
Best rum raisin in town.

21:44.565 --> 21:46.260
I'm partial to mint chip.

21:46.304 --> 21:48.826
Call me old-fashioned.

21:48.869 --> 21:50.304
How about you, Luke?

21:50.347 --> 21:52.478
You got a favorite ice cream?

21:52.521 --> 21:55.478
I don't know.

21:55.521 --> 21:58.000
FRANKS:
Ice cream flavors?!

21:58.043 --> 21:59.739
Probie, I get it.

21:59.782 --> 22:02.782
You want to trust the boy.
He was a good kid.

22:02.826 --> 22:05.695
Emphasis on "was."

22:05.739 --> 22:07.478
Nothing's what
it seems anymore.

22:07.521 --> 22:11.739
Innocence doesn't come
with youth or lipstick.

22:13.913 --> 22:17.173
When I was your age,
we used to readbooks.

22:17.217 --> 22:19.608
Now, I just download audiobooks,

22:19.652 --> 22:22.260
listen to 'em
when I travel.It's just music.

22:22.304 --> 22:24.086
Oh, I have songs, too.

22:24.130 --> 22:26.043
Dylan, Stones...

22:26.086 --> 22:27.304
Jay-Z.

22:27.347 --> 22:29.217
It's not that kind of music.

22:29.260 --> 22:30.956
Well, can I listen?

34:50.869 --> 34:52.391
[Gibbs speaking indistinctly]Daniel Budd?

34:52.434 --> 34:54.826
Yeah.Uh, yeah, I'm on it.

34:54.869 --> 34:55.869
Where are you?

34:55.913 --> 34:56.956
We're on our way
with Samar.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.565
With Samar?
How did-How did you...

34:58.608 --> 35:00.217
[hangs up]

35:00.260 --> 35:02.043
Gibbs?

35:02.086 --> 35:02.956
He and Joanna
are on their way up.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.695
They just booked Sadiq Samar.

35:04.739 --> 35:06.260
How'd they find Sadiq?

35:06.304 --> 35:07.608
And who's Daniel Budd?

35:07.652 --> 35:10.000
The leader
of The Calling.

35:10.043 --> 35:13.565
Daniel Budd.
25 years old, British

35:13.608 --> 35:16.608
political activist and
underground terrorist leader.

35:16.652 --> 35:18.521
Budd started as a London DJ.

35:18.565 --> 35:20.260
McGEE:
That would explain the music.

35:20.304 --> 35:21.521
So after
his 15 minutes

35:21.565 --> 35:23.043
of fame were over,

35:23.086 --> 35:24.782
he desperately wanted
to stay relevant.

35:24.826 --> 35:26.913
Surrounded himself
with misguided youth.

35:26.956 --> 35:28.826
Started robbing
from their parents.

35:28.869 --> 35:30.739
Petty theft led to assault
and kidnapping.

35:30.782 --> 35:32.913
He found disturbing
relevance in terrorism.

35:32.956 --> 35:35.652
My NSA informant
just I.D.'d Luke

35:35.695 --> 35:37.260
somewhere on
the outskirts of Zakho.

35:37.304 --> 35:38.826
He's already there.

35:38.869 --> 35:39.869
BISHOP:
Private charter took off

35:39.913 --> 35:41.173
before we got the BOLO out.

35:41.217 --> 35:42.739
Eyes on the street, boss?

35:42.782 --> 35:45.652
No, start with ours.
DiNozzo, grab your go bag.

35:45.695 --> 35:48.521
Officer Teague
is gonna arrange transport.

35:48.565 --> 35:50.565
Plane leaves in an hour.

35:58.782 --> 36:01.347
TEAGUE: This is the neighborhood
that Sadiq described.

36:01.391 --> 36:04.478
My people saw a van

36:04.521 --> 36:06.826
unload a group of Westernized
teens close by.

36:06.869 --> 36:08.739
Then they were
transferred into cars

36:08.782 --> 36:11.173
and taken to
various locations.

36:13.043 --> 36:14.913
Three o'clock.

36:14.956 --> 36:16.826
Look at the bright,
shiny kicks.

36:16.869 --> 36:19.391
Mm. I doubt she's here
with the debate team.

36:24.695 --> 36:26.608
Follow her.

36:40.478 --> 36:42.869
Sadiq Samar.

36:42.913 --> 36:45.304
Finally.

36:45.347 --> 36:47.478
Someone worth talking to.

36:48.869 --> 36:51.347
Have we met before?

36:51.391 --> 36:52.956
Never.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
But I know
who you are, Director.

36:55.043 --> 36:57.652
And I know that
we're both intelligent men.

36:57.695 --> 36:59.913
And I am confident

36:59.956 --> 37:03.217
that we can come
to some sort of mutual...

37:03.260 --> 37:05.043
understanding?

37:05.086 --> 37:07.608
You mean negotiate.

37:07.652 --> 37:11.782
Negotiation suggests
that we're at an impasse.

37:11.826 --> 37:13.826
You're a terrorist.

37:13.869 --> 37:15.478
We're at an impasse.

37:15.521 --> 37:19.956
Your reputation as
an interrogator precedes you.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.826
Oh, hell, Sadiq...

37:22.869 --> 37:25.086
I am just getting started.

37:37.739 --> 37:40.913
Do they come in wallet size?

37:41.956 --> 37:43.782
You think that's funny?

37:43.826 --> 37:47.217
I think that you are wasting

37:47.260 --> 37:49.739
your valuable time.

37:57.565 --> 38:01.739
Matthew Rousseau is already
halfway to a supermax prison.

38:06.434 --> 38:08.217
Give me Daniel Budd.

38:08.260 --> 38:10.608
You will never find him.

38:10.652 --> 38:12.652
We're both intelligent men.

38:12.695 --> 38:15.217
Try me.

38:18.739 --> 38:21.173
The outdoor restaurant in Egypt.

38:21.217 --> 38:23.782
The Grand Canyon.

38:23.826 --> 38:25.782
Big outdoor spaces.

38:25.826 --> 38:30.217
If these bombings
were tests...

38:33.608 --> 38:35.521
...what's your next target?

38:37.347 --> 38:38.652
Among others?

38:38.695 --> 38:41.434
Mm-hmm.

38:44.782 --> 38:47.173
Old, stubborn men

38:47.217 --> 38:49.782
sit on benches
their entire lives

38:49.826 --> 38:52.826
and get set
in their ways.

38:52.869 --> 38:55.782
Age, Director...

38:55.826 --> 38:57.608
age is the enemy

38:57.652 --> 38:59.956
of enlightened youth.

39:12.913 --> 39:15.739
Split off. I got this.

39:17.565 --> 39:19.347
[rooster crows in distance]

39:21.043 --> 39:22.826
ABBY:
Follow the dragon, McGee.BISHOP: Wait.

39:22.869 --> 39:24.652
It's not about the dragon,
it's about the sword.

39:24.695 --> 39:26.000
Use it on
the goblin.

39:26.043 --> 39:27.782
You're both wrong.
It's about the potions.

39:27.826 --> 39:29.217
Mmm, pick the yellow one.

39:29.260 --> 39:31.304
No, the yellow one's not
the hero one, the purple is.

39:34.739 --> 39:35.826
Got it.

39:36.869 --> 39:37.956
You win, my Elf Lord!

39:38.000 --> 39:39.304
Nice to know
I haven't lost my touch.

39:39.347 --> 39:40.217
Now what happens?

39:40.260 --> 39:41.695
Well, besides being crowned

39:41.739 --> 39:43.782
the King of Darrigone...

39:43.826 --> 39:45.260
Wait. What's this?

39:45.304 --> 39:47.521
Abby, the firewalls
are up, right?

39:47.565 --> 39:48.956
Yeah, next generation
and circuit-level gateway.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.782
BISHOP:
They're grids.

39:50.826 --> 39:52.739
Travel destinations.
Business hubs.

39:52.782 --> 39:53.913
Naval bases.

39:53.956 --> 39:55.782
Places for The Calling
to target next.

39:55.826 --> 39:58.565
How did they get access
to all this?

39:58.608 --> 39:59.869
They have kids inside.

39:59.913 --> 40:01.869
Children of
government employees.

40:01.913 --> 40:03.956
What if Luke's
still with them?

40:04.000 --> 40:05.391
What if he steered them
to Gibbs's house?

40:05.434 --> 40:07.739
McGee!Director, you gotta see this.

40:07.782 --> 40:09.565
Not now, McGee.

40:09.608 --> 40:11.565
The supreme court justices--
exactly where are they?

40:11.608 --> 40:13.217
They're on retreat.
It's all over the news.

40:13.260 --> 40:14.260
I know that.

40:14.304 --> 40:15.782
I asked where?

40:15.826 --> 40:17.565
A compound in the Appalachians.

40:17.608 --> 40:19.782
Well, get it on lockdown. Now.

40:44.652 --> 40:46.565
What do you want?

40:46.608 --> 40:48.565
United States federal agent.

40:48.608 --> 40:51.173
You can't be here.
It's not safe.

40:51.217 --> 40:53.695
I'm out for a walk.

40:53.739 --> 40:55.652
That's what they told me to do.

40:55.695 --> 40:57.913
Who? Who told you that?

40:57.956 --> 41:00.391
My new friends.

41:00.434 --> 41:02.000
The people I trust.

41:04.217 --> 41:07.739
[phone ringing]

41:08.956 --> 41:10.391
DiNozzo.

41:10.434 --> 41:12.913
Welcome to Iraq, Agent DiNozzo.

41:12.956 --> 41:14.478
Who is this?

41:14.521 --> 41:15.782
I've been reading
about you a lot.

41:15.826 --> 41:17.260
It's fabulous to finally

41:17.304 --> 41:18.478
make myself acquainted with you.

41:18.521 --> 41:20.434
This is Daniel?

41:20.478 --> 41:23.043
I am many things to many people.

41:23.086 --> 41:25.043
Well, to me you're a terrorist.

41:25.086 --> 41:27.869
Such an unfortunate moniker,
that: "terrorist."

41:27.913 --> 41:29.652
I really need to go.

41:29.695 --> 41:31.608
No, you're coming with us.

41:31.652 --> 41:33.782
I don't think so.

41:36.652 --> 41:37.869
We want the boy.
What do you want?

41:37.913 --> 41:39.434
Just to be heard.

41:39.478 --> 41:40.565
To be respected.

41:40.608 --> 41:42.956
Not to be handed
your broken promises.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.565
Welcome to the generation gap.

41:44.608 --> 41:46.826
Old habits die hard, Daniel.

41:46.869 --> 41:48.608
Or they just die.

41:48.652 --> 41:50.217
No, no, no, no, no, no...Are you hungry?

41:50.260 --> 41:51.565
You are hungry,
you are hungry.

41:59.478 --> 42:01.652
The boy, Luke...

42:01.695 --> 42:04.608
I'm sorry for being
the bearer of bad news,

42:04.652 --> 42:07.217
but these things are always more
complicated than they appear.

42:07.260 --> 42:09.521
Agent Gibbs will be
so disappointed.

42:09.565 --> 42:10.826
LUKE:
Agent Gibbs?

42:13.608 --> 42:15.217
DANIEL:
But we must remember,

42:15.260 --> 42:17.260
they're only children.

42:19.695 --> 42:21.521
