00:08.425 --> 00:10.969
So many people told me
when I started the Hype House

00:11.052 --> 00:12.554
that it was destined to fail

00:12.637 --> 00:16.349
and that I should have avoided
all the pain in the first place.

00:16.433 --> 00:19.019
After a year and a half,
maybe they were right.

00:20.186 --> 00:23.440
There was Team 10, FaZe,
Clubhouse,

00:23.523 --> 00:24.941
don't start on Sway House,

00:25.025 --> 00:28.403
they left in shambles
but that's not my tea.

00:28.486 --> 00:30.488
Like a lot of other houses
that passed,

00:30.572 --> 00:33.450
the Sway House was tied
to a talent management company

00:33.533 --> 00:36.619
and that management company
took a percentage of their careers.

00:36.703 --> 00:40.540
Hype House's fully and solely ours,
no agents, no investors, nothing.

00:40.623 --> 00:43.960
That's what people haven't done
and why Hype House has lasted so long.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.421
All right, so there's the Hype House--

00:47.255 --> 00:49.340
That's it.

00:49.424 --> 00:51.134
We're the only house still posting.

00:51.217 --> 00:52.886
There was Team 10 at a point.

00:52.969 --> 00:56.598
Well, I'm here in the Team 10 house
and there's nobody here.

00:56.681 --> 00:57.974
I'm leaving.

00:58.516 --> 01:00.518
They get a bunch
of young TikTokkers,

01:00.602 --> 01:03.271
they're just put together
as a cast of a show.

01:03.354 --> 01:04.522
Of course, they'll fail.

01:04.606 --> 01:06.399
They didn't become friends out of want,

01:06.483 --> 01:08.526
they became friends because they had to.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.155
You'll be challenged
in and out in social media

01:12.238 --> 01:14.532
and you have to be able
to make it through.

01:14.616 --> 01:18.328
I think the reason that
houses come to an end is because

01:18.411 --> 01:21.039
people get big-headed in a sense.

01:21.122 --> 01:23.958
We need to see Bryce's room,
it's the smallest in the house.

01:24.042 --> 01:26.211
-His bathroom's bigger than mine.

01:26.294 --> 01:29.255
What is that analogy,
"Every good thing comes to an end"?

01:29.339 --> 01:30.965
But was it a good thing, though?

01:31.883 --> 01:34.219
I've tried to give everyone
in this brand a future,

01:34.302 --> 01:35.428
tried to help them.

01:35.512 --> 01:37.847
The business side of me is very happy

01:37.931 --> 01:41.559
when people get to a point
where they don't need Hype House anymore

01:41.643 --> 01:44.395
and they're doing well,
'cause it shows how well I've worked.

01:44.479 --> 01:48.108
But on the personal end,
I just keep watching friends leave

01:48.191 --> 01:50.318
and I asked myself, "Why am I doing this?"

02:06.918 --> 02:09.546
Right now everything is surreal.

02:10.630 --> 02:13.466
Like, I'm about to sing live
for the first time.

02:14.092 --> 02:15.677
This is gonna be terrible.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.562
-What's up?
-What's up?

02:25.645 --> 02:28.481
Okay, so everything's all set
for the venue.

02:28.565 --> 02:31.776
Then when you get there, you'll have
a couple of minutes to settle in

02:31.860 --> 02:34.654
and then jump
right into a soundcheck with the band.

02:34.737 --> 02:36.447
And then, it's time.

02:38.491 --> 02:41.202
Today I'm having
a pop-up song release party

02:41.286 --> 02:44.956
for my first ever feature,
which is "Don't Freak Out."

02:51.838 --> 02:52.714
You got this.

02:54.966 --> 02:57.218
Man, I just don't wanna screw this up.

02:57.719 --> 02:59.179
I've never played live before.

02:59.262 --> 03:03.266
I don't know if they're gonna hate it,
I don't know if no one will show up.

03:03.349 --> 03:06.394
I'm seeing how hard it is to make it
and how hard you have to work

03:06.477 --> 03:08.021
and I have a lot to prove.

03:08.104 --> 03:09.439
You're gonna do great.

03:09.522 --> 03:12.859
The adrenaline will kick in
as soon as you hit that stage.

03:12.942 --> 03:15.195
Everyone there is there to support you.

03:15.278 --> 03:17.822
-Yeah.
-It's people you love most in your life.

03:17.906 --> 03:22.202
They want you to succeed
and to have an amazing first performance.

03:24.162 --> 03:27.498
-Well, the car is here, so we should--
-No!

03:28.708 --> 03:30.501
-You got this.

03:35.673 --> 03:37.467
-Rock star!

03:47.268 --> 03:49.938
Yo! Hey!

03:50.021 --> 03:52.398


03:59.989 --> 04:03.826
I'm about to go on stage
and I'm losing my mind.

04:06.704 --> 04:10.875
And then I walk up to the top deck,
and I'm like, "L.A., what's happening?"

04:10.959 --> 04:12.085
Hey, let's do this.

04:12.168 --> 04:14.045


04:14.128 --> 04:17.382
As I'm running down the stairs
my mic falls on the floor.

04:17.465 --> 04:18.466


04:18.549 --> 04:21.594


04:21.678 --> 04:24.889
And I had to pick it up,
I had to reattach it, put it on my pants.

04:24.973 --> 04:28.393
I'm like, "This is terrible,
I can't believe this is happening now."

04:28.476 --> 04:33.106
And then, all of a sudden,
I hear the rattling of drums going on.

04:35.733 --> 04:36.985
"I'm really about to do this."

04:40.947 --> 04:43.283
I get a bump in my ear
and it goes, "You're live."

04:43.366 --> 04:45.034
And I'm like… "No."

04:45.118 --> 04:48.288


04:57.964 --> 05:01.384
It was just a moment,
like, as soon as I got out there

05:01.467 --> 05:04.262
and starting partying,
all the jitters went away.

05:13.354 --> 05:15.732
-How we doing tonight?

05:15.815 --> 05:18.651
I'm never stopping this,
this is what I'm built to do.

05:19.235 --> 05:21.446
Thank you, guys, so much
for coming out and supporting me.

05:23.614 --> 05:25.742
My debut album drops next month.

05:26.284 --> 05:27.577
Who's ready for that?

05:28.494 --> 05:29.579
What is your end goal?

05:34.709 --> 05:37.962
Hang out, have some fun, I love you guys.

05:43.509 --> 05:46.095


05:46.179 --> 05:48.431


05:50.558 --> 05:51.517
Come on.

05:54.103 --> 05:55.855
-Hi.
-Hey!

05:56.439 --> 06:00.777
I'm so excited for my very first
plastic surgery procedure.

06:00.860 --> 06:03.571
-Oh.
-This week.

06:03.654 --> 06:05.156
In my journey as a trans woman,

06:05.239 --> 06:08.493
I've always had
this uncomfortable feeling in my skin.

06:08.576 --> 06:13.414
Like, there was never a time
when I was just happy being a boy.

06:13.498 --> 06:15.500
I can self-inject myself, you guys.

06:15.583 --> 06:20.713
I feel like I've done enough DIYs
in my lifetime with Home Depot products.

06:20.797 --> 06:23.383
I came to L.A.
with $150 in my bank account

06:23.466 --> 06:27.220
working the cashier at Panera Bread
and I wanted a sex change.

06:27.303 --> 06:30.598
So I was like, "You know what?
I'm gonna figure this one out."

06:30.681 --> 06:34.811
Well, I wanted to start off
by stating that I am transgendered.

06:34.894 --> 06:38.314
I want there to be a time
where no one has to hide who they are.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.483
There wasn't even information out there.

06:40.566 --> 06:43.027
That's what got me started
in social media.

06:43.111 --> 06:46.572
I'm gonna be looking in the mirror
and not even recognize myself for a while.

06:46.656 --> 06:50.660
I was so frustrated
with the lack of knowledge and education.

06:50.743 --> 06:53.162
I'm feeling so good for once.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.455
I decided to share it all.

06:55.873 --> 06:57.166
Ta-da!

06:57.708 --> 06:59.710
-You know what we're doing today?
-Yeah.

06:59.794 --> 07:02.672
-I think. Let me show you.
-Tell me what you want.

07:02.755 --> 07:06.634
I think the problem
is that my middle skin area is thin…

07:06.717 --> 07:07.552
Mm-hmm.

07:07.635 --> 07:12.140
…so the implant itself ripples here.

07:12.223 --> 07:14.642
-Mm-hmm.
-Like, so much.

07:14.725 --> 07:16.018
My transition is complete.

07:16.102 --> 07:19.564
For me, it's not defined easily, textbook.

07:19.647 --> 07:23.443
It's not like you get boobs, then a face,
then tits, then an ass.

07:23.526 --> 07:28.448
I realize that my womanhood is not
dictated by physical appearance

07:28.531 --> 07:29.532
or anything else.

07:29.615 --> 07:33.786
There's some trans people who just simply
change their name and their pronouns,

07:33.870 --> 07:35.329
and that's enough for them.

07:35.413 --> 07:39.542
I feel like, for me
honestly, after the boobs…

07:39.625 --> 07:43.337
once I had boobs, I was like, yep,
it's a wrap for everyone's life.

07:43.421 --> 07:46.674
I could be molded from clay
like any good marble statue.

07:46.757 --> 07:48.676
You're still my child no matter what.

07:48.759 --> 07:50.136
-Allegedly.
-I created you.

07:50.219 --> 07:52.430
It's hard work
to create a dragon of this force.

07:52.513 --> 07:54.223
-This is very true.

07:54.307 --> 07:58.728
I feel good about everything 'cause I know
it's not for anyone else but myself.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.481
-Good, your terms, you choose.
-Yeah.

08:01.564 --> 08:05.193
I'm super close to my family,
I have two amazing parents,

08:05.276 --> 08:07.028
they were super loving and supportive,

08:07.111 --> 08:11.949
but I never experienced high school
or college as who I wanted to be.

08:12.033 --> 08:14.619
So I had this, like, little idea.

08:14.702 --> 08:19.415
Like, there's certain moments
I never got to experience fully as Nikita.

08:19.499 --> 08:24.128
How dope would it be if we threw,
like, our own little prom?

08:25.129 --> 08:28.716
The Hype House
is my twisted high school fantasy

08:28.799 --> 08:31.969
that I've always wanted
to live out as Nikita Dragun.

08:32.053 --> 08:35.890
And now I feel like
I have a grasp of who I am

08:35.973 --> 08:38.559
and that was always my dream
from the jump.

08:38.643 --> 08:39.894
Good, you're all in.

08:39.977 --> 08:42.522
We gave you cleavage back
and you don't see rippling.

08:42.605 --> 08:44.524
Yeah, it's like so perfect.

08:44.607 --> 08:45.441
Thank you!

08:45.525 --> 08:50.446
I think I might just walk out like this
'cause my tits look so good!

09:02.333 --> 09:03.960
Yes!

09:04.043 --> 09:07.672
These are some of my favorite chips,
salt and vinegar mixed with barbecue.

09:07.755 --> 09:08.589
Huh.

09:08.673 --> 09:11.634
-You know what my favorite chips are?
-Huh?

09:11.717 --> 09:12.885
Cheddar and sour cream.

09:17.848 --> 09:18.849
Are you excited?

09:18.933 --> 09:19.850
Huh…

09:19.934 --> 09:21.394
I mean, I love my dad.

09:21.978 --> 09:25.856
I've been really stressed lately when it
comes to the Hype House and what to do

09:25.940 --> 09:29.402
and what I'm doing, and getting away
and talking to my dad might help.

09:29.986 --> 09:33.948
It's hard for me to go home because
part of the way I've gotten through

09:34.031 --> 09:36.450
and gotten where I am today
is just forgetting.

09:37.743 --> 09:38.661
That's not healthy.

09:38.744 --> 09:41.289
That's the healthiest way
to move through trauma.

09:41.372 --> 09:43.499
That's actually not,
that's opposite of what you do.

09:44.083 --> 09:46.294
Like, complete opposite.

09:54.969 --> 09:56.095
Come in!

09:56.178 --> 09:57.513


09:57.597 --> 09:58.806
What's up, Lazette?

09:58.889 --> 10:00.224


10:00.308 --> 10:01.601
-What's up, you?
-Hello!

10:01.684 --> 10:02.810
-Hi, Mia!
-What's up?

10:04.228 --> 10:08.190
I grew up with my parents separated,
I didn't see my dad very often.

10:08.274 --> 10:09.900
So what's going on with the house?

10:11.694 --> 10:16.198
I consider my dad a good friend of mine,
like, less a father figure.

10:16.282 --> 10:19.160
So I help him when I can now
and my little sister.

10:19.243 --> 10:21.412
I try to support them
in any way that I can.

10:21.954 --> 10:24.081
This used to be different,
I remember that big TV.

10:24.165 --> 10:26.834
-The gray one, the big box one.
-You remember that? Thick?

10:26.917 --> 10:28.252
-Mm-hmm.
-Nasty?

10:28.794 --> 10:31.255
You could only see
if you were right in front of it?

10:33.466 --> 10:36.510
-Life's changed a lot.
-Oh, yeah.

10:37.136 --> 10:39.597
-You having fun?
-Yeah.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.432
So you're happy?

10:41.515 --> 10:44.226
No. Not at all.

10:45.102 --> 10:47.938
You're always told
that money can't buy happiness

10:48.439 --> 10:51.150
but you'll never understand it
until you're in the position.

10:51.233 --> 10:55.363
I have everything I've wanted
and I feel so lucky

10:55.446 --> 11:00.576
but I feel like a kid
who has all the toys in the world

11:00.660 --> 11:02.662
but no batteries to operate them.

11:07.249 --> 11:10.670
I don't have anything I enjoy doing
and I don't know why.

11:11.545 --> 11:13.547
And I'm just trying to think of what's--

11:13.631 --> 11:17.426
Because you went through things
that you shouldn't have gone through.

11:17.510 --> 11:21.138
You never processed it,
it's still in the past,

11:21.222 --> 11:24.934
and unless you go back there
with some help, and get over it,

11:26.727 --> 11:29.188
then you might be stuck
in the same situation.

11:30.064 --> 11:31.232
-You know?
-Yeah.

11:31.315 --> 11:34.652
And buying stuff and cars
it's not gonna do it.

11:35.236 --> 11:39.073
I know that you and my mom,
everyone tried their best.

11:39.657 --> 11:44.328
But it's also hard when you're a kid
watching your mom go through a lot.

11:47.206 --> 11:50.501
Like, I always felt like
I was kind of, like, the parent.

11:50.584 --> 11:53.629
Like, I tried
to take care of her as best I could.

11:53.713 --> 11:58.300
See, I didn't know how bad it was
until you came to live with me.

11:58.926 --> 12:02.596
You went through a lot, know what I mean?
You went through a lot.

12:02.680 --> 12:07.184
My mom was seeing someone
who wasn't the greatest

12:07.268 --> 12:10.479
but it's not my place
to tell my mom's story.

12:10.563 --> 12:14.483
What I can say is that it really hurt me

12:14.567 --> 12:17.570
seeing my mom in a really bad situation.

12:17.653 --> 12:19.780
It sucked not being able to help her.

12:19.864 --> 12:22.199
-I felt like that was my responsibility.

12:22.283 --> 12:25.578
-No, it's not your responsibility.
-That's what I felt like.

12:25.661 --> 12:28.164
Like, I felt like
I should have been able to do more.

12:28.247 --> 12:30.791
You weren't supposed to be doing more,
you were a kid.

12:30.875 --> 12:31.709
I know.

12:32.460 --> 12:34.170
You were a freaking kid.

12:34.253 --> 12:37.089
You gotta quit saying,
"I'm always fine, everything's fine."

12:37.173 --> 12:38.215
I know.

12:42.011 --> 12:45.723
I think that's why I'm not fine,
'cause I'm finally allowed to be not fine.

12:50.644 --> 12:56.692
If you live in the past,
the past leads to depression.

12:57.193 --> 13:00.696
If you live in the future,
that leads to anxiety.

13:00.780 --> 13:05.910
So, if you try and live, like,
right now and just enjoy it,

13:05.993 --> 13:09.747
don't worry about tomorrow or yesterday,
just, like, right now, it helps.

13:10.539 --> 13:13.042
I feel like
I'm very anxious for the future.

13:13.125 --> 13:17.546
As you gain more success,
your anxiety gets worse every day

13:17.630 --> 13:20.090
'cause you have to keep that,
you have to stay there.

13:20.174 --> 13:23.010
I think if I could remove one stressor
from my life,

13:23.093 --> 13:26.639
and that possibly being Hype House,
would make me feel a lot better

13:26.722 --> 13:29.141
and make me focus on myself.

13:29.683 --> 13:34.355
I'm super proud of you
and I love you more than anything.

13:35.564 --> 13:36.899
I love you too, Pa.

13:37.483 --> 13:38.984
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

13:40.110 --> 13:41.028
I know.

13:51.664 --> 13:54.583


13:54.667 --> 13:56.877
No one step on Milo.

13:56.961 --> 13:59.797
Thomas, can you go put these?

13:59.880 --> 14:02.091
One table for raw meats,
one for cooked meats,

14:02.174 --> 14:03.676
put the tablecloths on, please.

14:03.759 --> 14:07.096
Two tables, one for raw meats,
one for cooked meats.

14:07.179 --> 14:08.430
The grill's out there.

14:08.514 --> 14:09.557


14:13.561 --> 14:17.106
-I'll just eat it like this, hold on.

14:17.189 --> 14:19.483
-This hot dog is so good!

14:20.067 --> 14:22.069
-Is Chase and them coming?
-Just our house.

14:22.152 --> 14:24.321
Nikita is totally missing out.

14:24.405 --> 14:26.323
Oh, that reminds me.

14:26.407 --> 14:28.784
So Nikita wanted
to throw a prom for everyone

14:28.868 --> 14:32.079
because a lot of people
didn't get one 'cause of COVID

14:32.162 --> 14:34.665
and she also wanted to redo prom,

14:34.748 --> 14:37.751
because she said in high school
she went dressed as a boy,

14:37.835 --> 14:39.712
and now is like, "I'm myself."

14:39.795 --> 14:42.715
That sounds so fun, will you ask me out?

14:42.798 --> 14:44.800
Who didn't go to prom? Raise your hand.

14:45.676 --> 14:47.303
-That's it?
-Yeah.

14:47.386 --> 14:50.556
I went to an all-guys school, we got one--

14:50.639 --> 14:52.308
-You went to an all-guys school?
-What?

14:52.391 --> 14:54.476
-You went to an all-guys school?
-Yes.

14:54.560 --> 14:57.229
-Why have we never heard this?
-I went to all-guys school.

14:57.313 --> 14:59.064
You went to Army Navy!

14:59.648 --> 15:02.234
-You were sent to Army Navy.
-You suck!

15:02.318 --> 15:04.069
Raise your hand if you went to prom.

15:04.778 --> 15:06.697
Who'd you go to prom with?

15:06.780 --> 15:09.408
-I went to my junior prom--
-You went to two proms?

15:09.491 --> 15:11.911
I went to two.
Mia went to three and Emily went to five.

15:11.994 --> 15:13.495
Fine. I'm back to being mad at you.

15:13.579 --> 15:16.332
How did I not know
you went to prom like three times?

15:16.415 --> 15:18.792
We don't talk
about what happened in high school.

15:18.876 --> 15:20.794
Apparently, we don't talk about a lot.

15:20.878 --> 15:22.046
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

15:22.129 --> 15:24.715
What, did you go with a guy two times too?

15:24.798 --> 15:26.592
Why are you like this?

15:26.675 --> 15:30.054
Vinnie, you should take Miley Cyrus.
The girl that DMed you?

15:31.680 --> 15:34.099
-Why are you looking at me like that?
-'Cause you're speaking.

15:35.643 --> 15:38.437
And she wants you.
She was like-- She hit you up.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.356
-Hell, yeah!
-Who?

15:40.439 --> 15:42.816
She just out of nowhere said,
"Should we go to prom together?"

15:46.362 --> 15:47.947
That's a perfect sentence.

15:48.030 --> 15:49.698
That's perfect!

15:49.782 --> 15:51.951
Miley's a cool person,
we were just talking,

15:52.034 --> 15:55.162
like, one of her buddies
went to prom with my tattoo artist,

15:55.245 --> 15:58.749
which I thought was pretty cool
but then it ended up being ironic

15:58.832 --> 16:00.501
that we were having our own prom.

16:00.584 --> 16:03.003
Vinnie, did you ask
to suck her toes or something?

16:03.087 --> 16:04.588
-What'd you say before?
-Nothing!

16:04.672 --> 16:06.840
-Who's Nikita going with?
-You should take her.

16:06.924 --> 16:08.842
Oh, you should, Vinnie.

16:08.926 --> 16:10.552
She loves you. Yes.

16:10.636 --> 16:15.891
Me and Nikita have gotten so much closer.
She definitely feels like a sister to me.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.602
Just because
we kind of bonded in that way.

16:22.481 --> 16:25.734
When I first moved into the Hype House
it was kind of iffy.

16:25.818 --> 16:29.697
It's hard to kind of just jump
into a group that have known each other.

16:29.780 --> 16:32.116
But as time went on we grew as friends.

16:32.199 --> 16:36.286
<i> Happy birthday, dear Vinnie!</i>

16:36.370 --> 16:39.248
Yes!

16:42.751 --> 16:46.922
It feels good to actually be here now
and solidify that this place is for me.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.383
I know it is
and I love all these guys here.

16:49.466 --> 16:52.011
Text her right now,
"Do you wanna go to prom with me?"

16:52.094 --> 16:53.762
-No!
-Yeah!

16:53.846 --> 16:56.140
Why are you guys looking at me?

17:03.313 --> 17:04.523
Greg, set it up.

17:16.994 --> 17:19.121
-
-That was awful!

17:19.204 --> 17:20.414
God awful.

17:20.497 --> 17:21.999
I thought I slayed.

17:22.082 --> 17:24.418
-Larray, we gotta do this thing.
-Okay.

17:24.501 --> 17:25.669
-Wait, right now?
-Yeah.

17:25.753 --> 17:29.631
Yeah, so we're gonna talk to Adam
and get an update on how things are going.

17:31.258 --> 17:32.217
-Hi, Adam.
-<i>Hi.</i>

17:32.301 --> 17:34.261
-Hey, Adam.
-Hey.

17:34.344 --> 17:38.515
<i>Guys, I have really fantastic news today.</i>

17:38.599 --> 17:39.683
-Excuse me?
-What?

17:39.767 --> 17:44.229
<i>Craig Robinson is now in final stages</i>
<i>of negotiation to do your movie.</i>

17:44.313 --> 17:47.816
That person you were talking about?
Oh, wait, that's so iconic!

17:47.900 --> 17:50.736
It's weird to think, like,
I'm gonna be in a movie.

17:50.819 --> 17:53.489
Movie! Like, okay, that's so crazy.

17:53.572 --> 17:55.491
This movie's based upon literally myself.

17:55.574 --> 17:59.286
It's a blessing TikTok exists because
it comes with so many other opportunities.

17:59.369 --> 18:02.831
It's so weird to say I'm doing a movie,
ew, like, you were just in Compton.

18:02.915 --> 18:03.916
Calm down, sir.

18:03.999 --> 18:06.752
Hm, but like, now I can just take care
of my family.

18:06.835 --> 18:09.588
-You have been my rock since day one.
-Mm-hmm.

18:09.671 --> 18:12.424
I should do something for you
for doing so much for me.

18:12.508 --> 18:14.802
-Ooh, you trying to kill me.
-No!

18:14.885 --> 18:16.637
-Is there another step?
-You're good.

18:16.720 --> 18:20.099
Because you're such a hard-working woman,
I wanted to give you this.

18:20.182 --> 18:21.433
Now you can turn around.

18:22.893 --> 18:24.812
You have a brand new car!

18:24.895 --> 18:26.396
-You lying.
-No, it's yours.

18:27.481 --> 18:30.943
I'm such a grandma/mommy boy,
they're single parents

18:31.026 --> 18:35.572
and they did above and beyond for me
so I'm doing this so they're okay.

18:35.656 --> 18:37.908
Just give us the Emmy
and call this a day.

18:37.991 --> 18:41.829
<i>No, Emmy's for TV, you're in movies now.</i>
<i>You're going for Oscars.</i>

18:41.912 --> 18:44.206
-Oh, yeah, that too.
-Brr…

18:44.289 --> 18:46.667
Oh my God. I'm so excited!

18:46.750 --> 18:51.463
I've been doing social media
for five years now. Anybody can be famous.

18:53.590 --> 18:56.343
Can I be famous
for being talented is the real question.

18:57.553 --> 18:58.679
Y'all, we're actors!

18:58.762 --> 19:01.515
That's why I started my keto diet
'cause we're actors now.

19:01.598 --> 19:03.433
-You're not keto.
-I am.

19:03.517 --> 19:05.894
-You just saw me be keto.
-We ate fried chicken.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.397
No, that was last night
and today's a new day.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.983


19:11.066 --> 19:12.317


19:15.904 --> 19:17.406
-All right.

19:22.202 --> 19:23.370
Oh, this is amazing.

19:23.453 --> 19:25.497
So this is the job we do,
drinking at 3 p.m.?

19:25.581 --> 19:26.415
Yeah.

19:26.498 --> 19:28.500
Okay, rock star living.

19:31.587 --> 19:32.546
Yeah.

19:32.629 --> 19:34.173
The show was so lit.

19:34.256 --> 19:37.134
To be able to perform
in front of a ton of people, I loved it.

19:41.388 --> 19:43.932
I see how real
this music's becoming for me.

19:44.016 --> 19:47.269
This is real life, we're doing it now,
it's happening.

19:47.352 --> 19:51.565
I feel like I'm so hungover
that I need to just, like, drink more.

19:52.316 --> 19:56.028
Or maybe that's, like,
what a person with a problem says.

19:58.906 --> 20:01.366
We've made it
to the Cheesecake Factory, everyone.

20:03.493 --> 20:04.620
This is hilarious.

20:05.495 --> 20:08.540
I love the backyard
of this house, it's nice.

20:08.624 --> 20:11.793
It was kind of nice that Chase
invited us over for the pool party.

20:11.877 --> 20:14.838
We were a little surprised
given the last time he had a dinner

20:14.922 --> 20:16.590
we weren't invited to it.

20:16.673 --> 20:19.218
But it sounds like
his event was super successful

20:19.301 --> 20:22.179
and I'm super excited
to see what he's gonna do next.

20:22.262 --> 20:23.513
What's up, guys?

20:23.597 --> 20:24.681
-Hey.
-Hey!

20:25.224 --> 20:27.476
Your outside
is my favorite part of this house.

20:27.559 --> 20:32.272
Oh, bro, I meditate here every day,
I come here to write.

20:32.356 --> 20:35.234
And now, like, bro,
I literally live with music enthusiasts

20:35.317 --> 20:36.693
-That's sick.
-He's impressed.

20:36.777 --> 20:38.779
Someone's been coming out here
a little bit.

20:38.862 --> 20:41.990
Yeah, I'm still figuring out
if I wanna do music, that's just…

20:42.074 --> 20:45.202
It's just a bucket list--
You ever write a song as a kid like,

20:45.285 --> 20:47.371
"I have to put this out
if I get the chance"?

20:47.454 --> 20:49.539
-Yeah.
-You've always been passionate.

20:49.623 --> 20:50.457
So passionate.

20:52.668 --> 20:57.214
I think for a while I didn't really know
what this music was gonna lead to,

20:57.297 --> 21:00.801
what it could be, then you put
together your first album, you're like,

21:05.180 --> 21:09.476
"Damn, now this, like, is my whole life,
this has consumed all of my time."

21:09.559 --> 21:14.898
And so I've slowly
had to kind of come to terms with

21:14.982 --> 21:18.318
the fact that I'm,
like, not doing social media anymore.

21:18.860 --> 21:23.699
And so that's why I don't know
if it makes sense for me anymore

21:23.782 --> 21:25.909
to, like, be a part of the business.

21:30.414 --> 21:33.083
You're wording it
like you're breaking up with us.

21:34.376 --> 21:38.797
Like, you do realize that
Hype House or not, we're friends right?

21:39.548 --> 21:41.675
-Like, we're still hanging out.
-Yeah, like--

21:41.758 --> 21:44.344
We love you,
we support you no matter what.

21:44.428 --> 21:48.056
I'm happy for you. I think
for a while now you've been feeling this

21:48.140 --> 21:50.142
and you didn't know
how to put it into words

21:50.225 --> 21:52.769
and that you were able to do it
is a huge thing for you.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.897
-Proud of you, genuinely.
-Yeah, seriously.

21:56.440 --> 21:59.026
I'm so happy
that Chase was finally honest with us.

21:59.109 --> 22:02.154
He wants to build his career
as a musician and I'm proud of him.

22:02.237 --> 22:06.867
By shutting down Hype House,
I'll be able to focus on what I want

22:06.950 --> 22:08.577
and kind of enjoy my life.

22:08.660 --> 22:10.996
You're on your own thing
and there's nothing wrong.

22:11.079 --> 22:14.833
I'm, like, still there for you guys
in the way, like, Nikita is.

22:14.916 --> 22:16.877
-I know.
-You're father figures for me.

22:16.960 --> 22:21.465
I grew to learn and mature
and become, like, an adult.

22:21.965 --> 22:24.509
They could have totally
been dickheads about it

22:24.593 --> 22:28.597
'cause I had been, like, you know,
very obstinate within the friend group

22:28.680 --> 22:31.558
but I'm really glad
that they were very understanding.

22:31.641 --> 22:36.480
It is nice to hear they're proud of me,
hearing it from people you love is dope.

22:37.272 --> 22:39.191
-So do we make out now or what?

22:39.274 --> 22:40.901
I know damn well you want this.

22:40.984 --> 22:43.653
-Come on, let's hug!
-Love you, buddy.

22:43.737 --> 22:44.905
I love you guys.

22:47.908 --> 22:51.411
Social media's been a roller coaster,
I've been through ins and outs

22:51.495 --> 22:54.539
and ups and downs,
like, really good and really bad

22:54.623 --> 22:57.751
and without my supporters, I mean,
I'd be nowhere today,

22:57.834 --> 23:00.504
I wouldn't be where I am,
I wouldn't be on my own two feet.

23:01.088 --> 23:05.550
I came from basically nothing
but they made just wanna keep going

23:05.634 --> 23:08.261
no matter what,
I was like, "I'm never stopping."

23:08.345 --> 23:11.848
I wouldn't be in this position at all
if it weren't for you guys,

23:11.932 --> 23:13.475
so, really thank you.

23:14.142 --> 23:16.019
-Let's go eat.
-Let's kiss.

23:16.103 --> 23:16.937
I'm down.

23:35.372 --> 23:36.289
Aw!

23:36.373 --> 23:38.625
-Did you go to prom?
-Yeah, I went to prom.

23:38.708 --> 23:40.544
-I've never been.
-You've never been?

23:40.627 --> 23:42.337
-About to pop out!
-Pop out?

23:42.421 --> 23:43.839
-Yeah.
-Damn.

23:43.922 --> 23:45.382
You think it's gonna be fun?

23:45.465 --> 23:48.885
Knowing our friend group,
there's gonna be some drama.

23:52.764 --> 23:55.851


23:55.934 --> 23:58.437
Boys! Do any of you guys
know how to tie a tie?

23:58.520 --> 24:00.230
Do any of you know how to tie a tie?

24:00.313 --> 24:03.316
-Tie a tie?
-I used to know, I can look it up.

24:03.400 --> 24:04.443
What are you wearing?

24:04.526 --> 24:06.736
I would wear my bathrobe
but they won't let me.

24:06.820 --> 24:09.281
-I might wear this.
-That would be a good look for prom.

24:10.282 --> 24:11.116
Let's go.

24:11.199 --> 24:14.286
<i> Now we're gonna take the fat end</i>
<i>and cross it over the skinny end.</i>

24:22.836 --> 24:24.629
Friend,
does my liner look stupid?

24:24.713 --> 24:27.215
<i>I like that side,</i>
<i>did you do it on the other side?</i>

24:27.299 --> 24:28.133
Not yet.

24:28.216 --> 24:31.011
I'm very curious
to see what Nikita's gonna wear.

24:31.094 --> 24:32.971
I keep thinking pasties and a thong.

24:38.935 --> 24:42.230
Oh, wait,
I think we're doing it.

24:42.314 --> 24:43.857
-Limo here?
-You leaving?

24:43.940 --> 24:44.983
-Ready?
-Yeah.

24:48.570 --> 24:51.823
Never stopping, there he go! Bye!

24:56.203 --> 24:58.371
-We're taking shots!

24:58.455 --> 24:59.748
Is that Larray's house?

25:05.212 --> 25:07.339
I got places to be, I'm going to prom!

25:08.715 --> 25:09.674
Okay!

25:09.758 --> 25:12.511
When I went to high school,
I had to go with my best friend

25:12.594 --> 25:15.138
and it was, like,
kind of weird 'cause it was a girl.

25:15.222 --> 25:17.098
But now I'm going with my boyfriend.

25:17.182 --> 25:18.850
-Larray!
-Yes?

25:18.934 --> 25:22.062
I haven't seen you since Joshua Tree,
how have you been?

25:22.646 --> 25:26.107
I've been amazing, I've been focusing
on my relationship and my happiness.

25:26.191 --> 25:27.108
As you should.

25:27.192 --> 25:30.737
I'm glad we're together in this moment
because we don't do this usually.

25:34.449 --> 25:35.367
Guys!

25:36.743 --> 25:38.578
Prom '21!

25:43.208 --> 25:45.418
I don't like parties,
it gives me anxiety.

25:45.502 --> 25:48.296
I used to go to parties
and I would clean everyone's house.

25:48.380 --> 25:52.217
They'd be like, "Thank you for bringing
your friend." And I'd be like…

25:52.300 --> 25:54.302
I'm stoked that Nikita threw this prom.

25:54.386 --> 25:57.055
I feel like everyone together
is the perfect opportunity

25:57.138 --> 25:59.558
for me to tell them
I'm shutting Hype House down.

26:00.058 --> 26:01.601
I wanna put sweats on.

26:02.185 --> 26:04.813
You know, you look good
in a dress and in sweats.

26:04.896 --> 26:06.481
Thanks, I prefer sweats.

26:06.565 --> 26:09.651
-I would trade outfits with you.
-You would? You wanna do that?

26:29.212 --> 26:31.089
-Come on.
-It's not what it looks like!

26:31.172 --> 26:32.924
-I'm sorry.
-I can explain.

26:33.008 --> 26:35.427
Yeah. Don't actually kiss me.

26:42.809 --> 26:46.104
One thing I'm psyched to see tonight
is Nikita's outfit, for sure.

26:46.187 --> 26:50.191
Nikita's gonna out dress everyone there.
It's the Met Gala for her.

26:50.275 --> 26:54.321
That's how she treats her every day,
is life is her runway.

26:57.282 --> 26:59.242
-Hi!

26:59.326 --> 27:02.162
-I made it.
-You look great! Oh my God.

27:02.245 --> 27:04.247
Totally freaking outdid me here.

27:04.331 --> 27:06.833
I got us some of these.

27:06.916 --> 27:10.211
-Perfect, do you know how to put them on?
-I know. Hell, no.

27:10.295 --> 27:14.341
For so long I was searching to have
that high school experience as Nikita.

27:14.424 --> 27:16.468
I didn't get to experience a prom,

27:16.551 --> 27:21.598
I didn't get to experience first love
or, you know, maybe high school drama

27:21.681 --> 27:25.727
because I was so scared to be
who I've always wanted to be.

27:25.810 --> 27:30.357
And it's almost like opening
the flood gates to this fantasy land.

27:30.440 --> 27:34.069
And realizing that wait,
life is kind of, like, cool.

27:35.320 --> 27:36.529
Aw, Nikita!

27:36.613 --> 27:38.615
-Hey!
-Nikita!

27:42.535 --> 27:44.829
You look so pretty!

27:47.499 --> 27:48.875
This is your night.

27:48.958 --> 27:50.418
-Is it?
-It is.

27:50.502 --> 27:55.090
I never thought I would see Nikita in
this much clothes but she looks amazing.

27:55.590 --> 27:57.092
And I'm so proud of my girl.

27:59.219 --> 28:00.553
She looks better than me!

28:01.137 --> 28:02.013
Smile!

28:13.400 --> 28:16.861
You're the person at the party
who would go straight to the pantry.

28:16.945 --> 28:18.530
Don't think you have enough candy.

28:18.613 --> 28:21.533
-Want a burger?
-Why do you have a burger?

28:21.616 --> 28:22.826
Oh, you ate that?

28:22.909 --> 28:24.035
Oh, snacks!

28:27.539 --> 28:28.915
-Thank you for that.

28:29.499 --> 28:30.834
I'm so happy right now.

28:30.917 --> 28:32.669
-I like where we're at.
-I do too.

28:32.752 --> 28:36.047
I don't know,
going to my dad's grave opened my eyes.

28:36.131 --> 28:38.883
I feel like you didn't understand
how much it meant to me.

28:39.509 --> 28:43.221
And I'm glad you could come down with me
and see me when I was vulnerable

28:43.304 --> 28:45.724
and, you know,
I haven't cried like that in years.

28:45.807 --> 28:47.600
-I mean, it's like--
-I know.

28:47.684 --> 28:49.561
-I mean--
-I felt safe.

28:50.186 --> 28:51.438
-You know?
-That's good.

28:51.521 --> 28:52.856
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

28:52.939 --> 28:54.816
I love you and I wanna be there for you.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.026
Kouvr is a nurturer.

28:57.110 --> 29:00.613
Her sole purpose,
she believes, is to take care of things.

29:00.697 --> 29:04.409
I do have someone here, present,
in the moment, that I need to make happy.

29:04.993 --> 29:07.495
Because I'm taking for granted
what I really have.

29:07.579 --> 29:12.333
Well, I appreciate you being more open
and, like, us talking more.

29:12.417 --> 29:17.255
'Cause, like, I never did that before.
Talking about problems is really nice.

29:17.338 --> 29:19.549
-I love you.
-I love you.

29:19.632 --> 29:23.136
I think visiting his dad was
a very, like, crucial point for him.

29:23.219 --> 29:26.890
I definitely don't think he's ever going
to stop doing what he's doing work-wise.

29:26.973 --> 29:30.226
But he has found a better balance
with considering how I'm feeling

29:30.310 --> 29:33.104
before he makes
a bit off of our relationship.

29:33.188 --> 29:36.399
He's definitely thinking a little more,
which I appreciate.

29:36.483 --> 29:40.987
These last two months have made me think
about when I'm ready to start a family.

29:41.070 --> 29:44.282
-Mm-hmm.
-I'm giving it thought, try not to rush it

29:44.365 --> 29:48.369
'cause it is a crucial,
huge moment in both of our lives.

29:48.453 --> 29:52.081
And I don't want to be unfair to you
because you want it now.

29:52.165 --> 29:53.583
Not now but soon.

29:53.666 --> 29:56.294
I'm gonna spend my life with Kouvr,
that's not a question.

29:56.377 --> 29:58.963
It's about the timing.
She's gonna be an amazing mother

29:59.047 --> 30:02.550
but when the time's right
so I can be an amazing father.

30:02.634 --> 30:04.969
-I don't wanna be 40.
-No, I don't think we'll be--

30:05.053 --> 30:06.387
-Or 30.
-Okay.

30:07.305 --> 30:08.723
-Or 20. Or 25.

30:09.766 --> 30:12.101
If it's not broke, why fix?

30:12.185 --> 30:15.146
-Not fix but upgrade, maybe.
-No, I know, okay.

30:18.107 --> 30:19.192
One should have…

30:20.360 --> 30:24.656
one, two, three, five, six, seven,
or eight outfit changes in a day.

30:28.493 --> 30:29.661
Okay!

30:34.249 --> 30:35.750
I knew there was a change.

30:36.835 --> 30:39.170
Nikita outfit eight,
I will give it to her.

30:40.088 --> 30:42.715
Y'all can say whatever you want about her,
her outfits eat.

30:50.723 --> 30:51.766
Everyone!

30:51.850 --> 30:53.476
How do I get everyone's attention?

30:53.560 --> 30:54.477
Nikita, yell.

30:55.061 --> 30:56.312
-Just do it.
-I can't.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.356
Hey!

31:00.275 --> 31:01.985
I would just like to thank everybody

31:02.068 --> 31:05.238
for letting me experience
my high school prom

31:05.321 --> 31:07.991
because I never
got to experience it as Nikita.

31:08.074 --> 31:11.411
-And…

31:11.494 --> 31:12.453
I'm the queen!

31:12.537 --> 31:14.330
-He's the queen, I'm the king.
-Queen!

31:14.414 --> 31:17.208
I just really hope
you guys enjoyed being together.

31:17.292 --> 31:20.628
-Because I truly consider you guys family.
-Family!

31:20.712 --> 31:22.755
-I would kill anyone for you.
-Kill!

31:22.839 --> 31:25.300
-Would you?
-Allegedly.

31:25.383 --> 31:29.387
Beyond all of that,
we've gone through so much together.

31:29.470 --> 31:31.890
We fight like family.

31:31.973 --> 31:33.558
We kiss.

31:34.142 --> 31:37.061
We make up. And I love you.

31:37.145 --> 31:38.730
We love you too.

31:38.813 --> 31:41.316
-Thank you.
-I thought that was going to be in sync.

31:41.399 --> 31:45.653
That's all from me, TTYL. You better
tell everyone I'm a bitch. Okay, bye.

31:48.990 --> 31:52.911
Looking around at everyone here at prom
smiling, dancing, having a good time,

31:52.994 --> 31:56.539
it's reminded me
of why I started this in the first place.

31:56.623 --> 31:58.666
We're not like those other content houses.

31:58.750 --> 32:01.210
These kids have been
a part of my family and…

32:01.294 --> 32:03.338
we can have exciting times, ups and downs,

32:03.421 --> 32:06.049
we can push people out
to the next chapter in their career

32:06.132 --> 32:07.634
and we can continue to do so,

32:07.717 --> 32:10.178
and I think that's why
we're here two years later.

32:12.513 --> 32:16.726
No matter how we got to who we are today,
we should all remember where we came from.

32:16.809 --> 32:20.647
The collective of Hype House
elevated all of us together

32:20.730 --> 32:23.024
because we're all just really close

32:23.107 --> 32:25.777
and people saw that and loved that.

32:25.860 --> 32:28.696
I just don't wanna fight anymore.
I love you.

32:28.780 --> 32:31.741
Everybody in this house
is like a brother or a sister.

32:31.824 --> 32:34.202
They're the closest people
I know I can talk to.

32:34.285 --> 32:35.328
Like family to me.

32:35.411 --> 32:37.747
I think everything
that comes at you is a lesson.

32:37.830 --> 32:40.041
You can either
let it hold you back or grow.

32:40.124 --> 32:44.003
And so I think that everybody took in
those sweet times everyone had together,

32:45.797 --> 32:49.634
and now it's taking all that,
learning from it and moving forward.

32:49.717 --> 32:51.594
Yeah!

32:51.678 --> 32:55.181
Love these guys, 'cause when I had
no one they were my family, for sure.

32:55.264 --> 32:58.935
Of course one day I'm gonna move out,
one day Thomas is gonna move out

32:59.018 --> 33:01.562
but I think Hype House itself
will always be something.

33:01.646 --> 33:06.484
I've been stressing a lot about what to do
with this brand and this group in general

33:06.567 --> 33:07.777
and…

33:12.991 --> 33:14.367
Maybe I shouldn't end it.

33:15.243 --> 33:18.663
Seeing everyone together
makes me excited for the future.

33:18.746 --> 33:22.000
While this might be
the end of one chapter of Hype House,

33:22.083 --> 33:23.543
there's so many things to come.

33:23.626 --> 33:25.128
Maybe it's time for new people,

33:25.211 --> 33:29.090
and I'm excited
for the future of Hype House 3.0.

33:29.173 --> 33:32.218
We've been through so much
and we gotta figure out what's next

33:32.301 --> 33:34.012
and that's what I'm focused on now.

34:08.963 --> 34:10.798
Got an emotional story to tell you guys.

34:16.304 --> 34:18.639
We've had to deal with
a lot in this house.

34:18.723 --> 34:21.434
We realize we've been
pushing it a little living together.

34:21.517 --> 34:22.560
We've had a discussion

34:22.643 --> 34:25.813
that it doesn't make sense
for us to all live together anymore.

34:30.902 --> 34:33.404
Alex, Kouvr, Calvin, Pat, and Paper
are getting a place.

34:33.488 --> 34:36.532
It'll just be me, Vinnie,
Jack, Mia, and Jake living here.

34:37.200 --> 34:39.160
Why is this so hard for me?

34:39.911 --> 34:42.747
That's Alex and Kouvr's stuff.
That's Alex and Kouvr's stuff.

34:42.830 --> 34:44.999
It's actually happening.
It's really depressing.

34:45.083 --> 34:49.879
Alex and Kouvr are still part
of Hype House and will be in everything.

34:49.962 --> 34:53.132
These people have been my best friends
for a very long time.

34:53.216 --> 34:56.177
Saying goodbye to them
is more difficult than I thought.

34:58.596 --> 35:02.225


35:02.308 --> 35:04.435
I'm very anxious for the future.

35:04.519 --> 35:07.772
My plan is to add some more people
and I think I've found a couple.

35:07.855 --> 35:09.857
I got a lot planned, so stay tuned.
