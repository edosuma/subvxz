00:55.097 --> 00:57.140
Go on, go on!

00:58.392 --> 01:00.394
Come on, Jo, come on!

01:00.477 --> 01:04.188
Come on, move with the ball!

01:04.313 --> 01:07.609
That's it, up, come on, jump!

01:07.776 --> 01:10.863
Don't let it drop into your hands, jump!

01:10.946 --> 01:12.948
Go for it, Jo, come on!

01:14.157 --> 01:16.159
That's right, go on.

01:23.167 --> 01:26.211
Oh, come on, Jo,
pull yourself together!

01:26.378 --> 01:27.671
Move with it!

01:43.312 --> 01:45.564
You're not much good at netball,
are you, Jo?

01:45.689 --> 01:47.608
No, I’m bad on purpose.

01:47.691 --> 01:50.819
- Are you going dancing tonight?
- I can't.

01:50.903 --> 01:53.113
You never go anywhere, do you?

01:53.197 --> 01:56.116
I haven't got any clothes to wear,
for one thing.

01:56.200 --> 01:58.535
- And for another...
- What?

01:58.660 --> 02:01.288
We might be moving home again.

02:01.371 --> 02:03.749
Like gypsies, you and your mother.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.877
So what?

02:51.004 --> 02:55.425
Don't think it's the first time I’ve heard you
and your men friends here in the afternoon.

02:55.509 --> 02:58.345
This is a respectable house
and I mean to keep it that way.

02:58.470 --> 03:02.349
I warned you when you first came,
no gentlemen and pay regular.

03:02.432 --> 03:06.103
You owe me two months' rent.
If I don't have it by tomorrow, you're out!

03:06.270 --> 03:09.815
I don't want any more of your fancy men
coming in here.

03:09.940 --> 03:13.694
- And that's my last word!
- Oh, shut up, you'll get your rent.

03:21.076 --> 03:23.120
Suppose that means another flit?

03:23.203 --> 03:27.958
She's always glued to television at tea time.
We can slip out that window.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.127
Now, come on, hurry up!

03:30.210 --> 03:32.296
Be a bit useful for a change.

03:37.968 --> 03:40.179
Now, come on, hurry up!

03:58.488 --> 04:01.950
Now, come on, hurry up, keep quiet!

04:15.172 --> 04:17.216
Come on!

04:40.364 --> 04:43.909
# Oh, the big ship sails
on the alley-alley-o

04:44.076 --> 04:47.246
# The alley-alley-o, the alley-alley-o

04:47.371 --> 04:50.499
# Oh, the big ship sails
on the alley-alley-o

04:50.624 --> 04:54.711
# On the last day of September

05:11.687 --> 05:15.357
# The captain said
it would never never do

05:15.440 --> 05:18.527
# Never never do, never never do

05:18.652 --> 05:21.864
# The captain said
it would never never do

05:21.947 --> 05:25.742
# On the last day of September

05:31.790 --> 05:35.627
# We dipped our heads
in the deep blue sea

05:35.752 --> 05:38.547
# The deep blue sea, the deep blue sea

05:38.630 --> 05:41.842
# We dipped our heads
in the deep blue sea

05:41.967 --> 05:45.345
# On the last day of September

06:13.457 --> 06:16.919
# Oh, the big ship sails
on the alley-alley-o

06:17.085 --> 06:20.422
# The alley-alley-o, the alley-alley-o

06:20.547 --> 06:23.842
# Oh, the big ship sails
on the alley-alley-o

06:23.926 --> 06:27.346
# On the last day of September

06:28.639 --> 06:34.186
# Oh, the big ship sails
on the alley-alley-o #

06:39.399 --> 06:41.693
Come on, hurry up.
Hurry up, Jo. Can you manage? Hurry up.

06:41.735 --> 06:45.155
- Let me give you a hand.
- Thanks very much.

06:46.990 --> 06:49.076
it’s up here.

06:56.917 --> 07:02.214
Oh, she's so stupid!
She's getting bone lazy, that girl.

07:15.894 --> 07:19.648
Thanks very much. Ta-ra.

07:20.274 --> 07:22.317
See ya.

07:28.490 --> 07:31.660
- This the bedroom?
- Well, what do you think?

07:33.120 --> 07:35.289
Sharing a bed again, I see.

07:35.414 --> 07:38.542
I can't bear to be parted from you
for a minute

07:38.709 --> 07:41.795
What I wouldn't give
for a room of me own.

07:42.629 --> 07:44.673
Oh, isn't that awful?

07:44.798 --> 07:46.800
Well, don't look at it, then.

07:46.884 --> 07:52.139
I do hate to see an unshaded light bulb
dangling from the ceiling like that.

07:52.222 --> 07:57.019
- Ooh! God, it's hot!
- Oh, you do get on my nerves!

07:57.060 --> 07:59.104
Why can't you leave things alone?

07:59.229 --> 08:03.233
- I can get a proper shade tomorrow.
- What makes you think we'll live that long?

08:03.317 --> 08:05.485
The roof's leaking.

08:05.611 --> 08:08.155
No, it's not, it's condensation.

08:08.322 --> 08:12.117
Make me a cup of coffee, love, I feel rotten.

08:12.242 --> 08:15.412
Every time I move me head
me eyeballs hurt.

08:15.537 --> 08:19.249
- Where's the kitchen?
- it’s along the corridor. Ooh...

08:19.374 --> 08:22.586
D'you know, I think I’ve got
more than a cold. I think it's flu.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.755
Why should I run after you?

08:24.838 --> 08:27.716
Because children owe their parents
these little attentions!

08:33.222 --> 08:35.265
Which knob do I turn?

08:35.349 --> 08:38.894
Switch 'em all on, you're bound
to find the right one in the end.

08:38.977 --> 08:41.522
And mind you don't gas yourself.

08:41.605 --> 08:44.983
Oh, the way you bang about!

08:46.944 --> 08:50.739
- Where's the coffee?
- Er... it's in the brown suitcase.

08:50.864 --> 08:55.994
I was thinking of washing me hair tonight
but I don't think I’d better with this cold.

08:56.119 --> 08:59.540
Oh, do hurry up, love,
I’ve got to meet Peter.

09:02.417 --> 09:04.169
Who's Peter?

09:12.803 --> 09:16.431
- Now, don't get into any mischief, Gladys.
- Oh, go on!

09:19.476 --> 09:22.396
Cheeky monkey!

09:29.236 --> 09:31.280
# Why does he follow me about

09:31.363 --> 09:33.699
# And wait up for me when it's my night out?

09:33.782 --> 09:37.703
# Why? Because he loves me

09:37.828 --> 09:42.040
# Why does he help me shell the peas
and stick the fork in the sausages?

09:42.124 --> 09:45.836
# Why? Because he loves me

09:45.919 --> 09:50.090
# And when he's got lumbago
in his back I’ve got

09:50.174 --> 09:54.219
# To make him poultices, all nice and hot

09:54.303 --> 09:56.555
# Why does he smile with never a frown?

09:56.680 --> 09:58.891
# If it gets too hard it slips right down

09:59.016 --> 10:02.644
# Why? Because he loves me #

10:03.228 --> 10:05.731
More!

10:05.856 --> 10:07.941
Oh, no, go on!

10:10.569 --> 10:13.405
# Why when his wife gives me the sack

10:13.530 --> 10:15.407
# He throws her out and he takes me back

10:15.490 --> 10:19.369
# Why? Because he loves me

10:19.494 --> 10:21.872
# Why does his wife wear bits of string

10:21.955 --> 10:23.957
# While I wear garters with diamonds in?

10:24.041 --> 10:27.336
# Why? Because he loves me

10:27.503 --> 10:31.924
# I have to lather him each morning
when he shaves

10:32.049 --> 10:36.011
# I piles the lather on in little waves

10:36.136 --> 10:38.555
# Why does he sit in his chair and blush

10:38.639 --> 10:40.516
# When I tickle his chin with a lather brush?

10:40.641 --> 10:44.394
# Why? Because he loves me #

10:50.817 --> 10:52.945
Oh, shut up!

10:54.571 --> 10:56.573
Give over!

10:57.574 --> 10:59.409
Oh, no.

10:59.493 --> 11:03.539
- Buzz off, love, I don't feel like it.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

11:03.705 --> 11:06.667
What's the little lady want,
an engagement ring?

11:06.750 --> 11:08.961
I always accept the odd diamond ring
with pleasure.

11:16.552 --> 11:19.763
- Who's that?
- it’s me daughter.

11:20.389 --> 11:23.267
- Hello, then.
- What's this one called?

11:23.392 --> 11:24.977
Oh, go to bed, go on!

11:25.102 --> 11:27.104
- Are you coming?
- Not yet.

11:27.229 --> 11:29.273
Then I’II wait for you.

11:30.399 --> 11:32.401
is she always like this?

11:32.526 --> 11:35.320
- She's jealous.
- That's something I didn't bargain for.

11:36.613 --> 11:39.950
- She ought to be in bed.
- I know.

11:40.075 --> 11:42.286
Shall I retire
while you kiss her good night?

11:42.369 --> 11:45.289
I’II kiss you good night, young lady!

11:45.372 --> 11:48.417
Look after your mother while she's ailing.

11:48.542 --> 11:51.295
You know how fragile these old ladies are.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.630
Oh, buzz off!

11:53.755 --> 11:56.425
Ooh, he's a noisy beggar, that one.

11:57.509 --> 11:59.553
What's that bed like?

11:59.678 --> 12:02.639
Like a coffin, only half as comfortable.

12:02.723 --> 12:05.267
it’s where we all end up in the end.

12:05.434 --> 12:09.313
Oh, now, come on, Jo, get that light off
and let's get to bed.

12:14.651 --> 12:19.573
- Aren't we going to clear this luggage up?
- Oh, it'll look all right in the dark.

12:23.243 --> 12:26.705
Yeah, it's seen at its best, this room,
in the dark.

12:26.872 --> 12:29.541
Everything's seen at its best in the dark.

12:29.666 --> 12:31.668
Even me.

12:31.793 --> 12:34.922
I can't understand
why you're so frightened of it.

12:35.005 --> 12:38.675
it’s not the darkness outside
I’m frightened of.

12:40.636 --> 12:43.680
it’s the darkness inside houses I don't like.

12:53.774 --> 12:58.987
Hey, Jo, what would you do if I told you
I was thinking of getting married again?

12:59.112 --> 13:02.658
I’d have you locked up in an institution
right away.

14:15.022 --> 14:19.193
- You're up early.
- it’s a long way from here to school.

14:19.276 --> 14:23.447
Not for much longer, thank God.
Only a few more days.

14:23.572 --> 14:27.117
You're still set on leaving, then.
What are you going to do?

14:27.242 --> 14:31.455
Get out of your sight as soon as possible.
Get a bit of money in me pocket.

14:31.538 --> 14:36.293
Well, it's your life, ruin it your own way.
Takes me all me time to look after meself.

14:42.799 --> 14:45.761
- Here, love, you've forgotten this... Oh.
- Give those to me!

14:45.928 --> 14:49.014
- Oh, I say.
- Leave them alone, I’II pick them up.

14:49.139 --> 14:52.184
- Have you done these?
- Yes.

14:52.309 --> 14:55.854
Oh, I didn't realise I’d got
such a talented daughter.

14:55.979 --> 14:58.440
I’m not just talented, I’m geniused.

14:58.607 --> 15:00.776
What's these?

15:00.817 --> 15:03.487
Self-portraits. Oh, give 'em here.

15:03.612 --> 15:06.907
I suppose you've got to draw yourself,
nobody else'd draw you.

15:08.909 --> 15:11.829
Hey! is that supposed to be me?

15:11.912 --> 15:13.121
Yes.

15:13.288 --> 15:15.457
Don't I look a proper misery?

15:15.499 --> 15:18.377
Still, it's very artistic, in't it?

15:19.294 --> 15:24.591
Tell me, Jo, have you ever thought of taking
it up properly and going to art school?

15:24.675 --> 15:26.718
I’ve had enough of schools.

15:26.844 --> 15:29.721
Too many different schools
in too many different places.

15:29.888 --> 15:32.224
Well, I think you're wasting yourself, I do.

15:32.349 --> 15:34.810
So long as I don't waste anybody else.

15:34.893 --> 15:37.312
Anyway, why are you so suddenly
interested in me?

15:37.437 --> 15:39.481
You never cared much before.

15:39.606 --> 15:43.235
I know. I’m a cruel, wicked mother

15:43.569 --> 15:47.155
\x22The voice I hear this passing night
was heard

15:47.281 --> 15:51.159
\x22In ancient days by emperor and clown:

15:51.285 --> 15:55.122
\x22Perhaps the selfsame song
that found a path

15:55.205 --> 16:00.085
\x22Through the sad heart of Ruth,
when, sick for home

16:00.252 --> 16:03.255
\x22She stood in tears amid the alien corn;

16:03.338 --> 16:05.632
\x22The same that ofttimes hath

16:05.716 --> 16:10.012
\x22Charm'd magic casements,
opening on the foam

16:10.095 --> 16:14.766
\x22Of perilous seas,
in faery lands forlorn.

16:15.475 --> 16:19.479
\x22Forlorn! the very word is like a bell

16:19.563 --> 16:24.443
\x22To toll me back from thee
to my sole self.

16:24.568 --> 16:27.946
\x22Adieu! the Fancy cannot cheat so well

16:28.071 --> 16:32.159
\x22As she is famed to do, deceiving elf.

16:32.242 --> 16:37.247
\x22Adieu! adieu! thy plaintive anthem fades

16:37.372 --> 16:42.628
\x22Past the near meadows,
over the still stream,

16:42.753 --> 16:48.091
\x22Up the hillside;
and now 'tis buried deep...\x22

17:26.128 --> 17:27.673
Oh!

18:52.049 --> 18:53.675
Hey!

18:56.220 --> 18:58.388
Don't you remember me?

18:58.514 --> 19:01.266
Oh, yes, you helped us off the bus.

19:01.350 --> 19:04.436
That's right. What you doing out here?

19:05.187 --> 19:07.272
What are you?

19:07.356 --> 19:09.358
I’m the cook.

19:09.483 --> 19:11.652
What's the matter with your knee?

19:11.735 --> 19:14.154
I fell down some steps at school.

19:14.238 --> 19:16.698
Looks bad. Needs a bandage.

19:20.661 --> 19:22.996
Come on, I’II fix it for you.

19:23.080 --> 19:24.540
Where are we going?

19:24.665 --> 19:26.750
Come on.

19:27.251 --> 19:29.419
They're all off duty.

19:40.848 --> 19:42.891
Come on!

19:43.016 --> 19:45.018
I’ve never been on one of these before.

19:45.102 --> 19:47.145
it’s all right.

19:55.070 --> 19:57.281
Mind your 'ead.

20:11.753 --> 20:14.173
So this is where you do your cooking, is it?

20:14.298 --> 20:16.884
Yes, this is it. Now, come on.

20:17.301 --> 20:19.344
Let's have a look at it.

20:26.894 --> 20:30.063
- Oh, very 'handsome!
- Sure, now, come on!

20:30.147 --> 20:34.067
Don't be so soft.
I won't hurt you, I’m very professional.

20:36.403 --> 20:40.073
- What were you doing round here, anyway?
- I was kept in late at school.

20:40.157 --> 20:43.327
I didn't want to go home until me mam
had gone out with her boyfriend.

20:43.410 --> 20:44.495
I often come this way.

21:49.476 --> 21:51.603
Shh!

22:06.994 --> 22:09.705
it’II take him a long time to sleep that off.

23:04.384 --> 23:07.679
Helen, come and live with me.

23:07.846 --> 23:10.265
Oh, go on, I don't fancy it.

23:11.934 --> 23:15.354
- I may never ask you again.
- Oh, go on!

23:17.564 --> 23:19.983
I want to make an honest woman of you.

23:20.067 --> 23:23.153
- Oh, go on, you're drunk.
- I’m not, I’m not.

23:23.237 --> 23:25.531
I’m old enough to be your mother.

23:25.614 --> 23:29.201
You know I like
this mother-and-son relationship.

23:29.368 --> 23:31.370
Oh, stop it!

23:31.453 --> 23:34.998
- Aren't you wearing your girdle?
- Oh, give over!

23:37.751 --> 23:43.298
Well, you certainly liberate something in me
and it's not maternal instincts, either!

23:56.520 --> 24:00.232
I must go in.
I’ve got to see about a job tomorrow.

24:00.357 --> 24:02.359
Will I see you?

24:02.442 --> 24:05.737
I’m not coming to that ship again.
Anything might happen to a girl!

24:05.821 --> 24:10.033
- it almost did, you shameless woman!
- it’s you taking advantage of my innocence.

24:10.117 --> 24:13.203
- You enjoyed it as much as I did.
- Shut up!

24:13.287 --> 24:16.665
This is the sort of conversation
that can colour a young girl's mind.

24:16.790 --> 24:20.002
I must go in and get me beauty sleep.

24:20.711 --> 24:24.548
Good night.

24:26.258 --> 24:28.260
Good night, Jo!

24:37.102 --> 24:38.437
Hey!

24:39.938 --> 24:42.983
- Surprised to find me waiting for you?
- Not really.

24:43.066 --> 24:45.944
- Glad I came?
- You know I am.

24:45.986 --> 24:48.155
I’II walk you home.

24:57.080 --> 25:01.251
it’s sad to think that once I was a happy
young man without a care in the world.

25:01.376 --> 25:03.420
Now I’m trapped in a primitive cult.

25:03.545 --> 25:06.381
- What's that? Mau Mau?
- No, matrimony!

25:06.465 --> 25:10.802
Trapped? I like that!
You almost begged me to marry you.

25:10.928 --> 25:12.930
Did your ancestors come from Africa?

25:13.013 --> 25:18.143
No, Liverpool! Were you expecting to marry
a man whose father beat the tom-tom?

25:21.688 --> 25:24.191
There's still a bit of jungle in you
somewhere.

25:29.196 --> 25:31.949
- I must go home.
- You're the boss.

25:34.201 --> 25:36.245
Well, goodbye.

25:36.370 --> 25:40.082
- Hey! Aren't you gonna kiss me goodbye?
- You know I am.

25:43.210 --> 25:45.379
Dream of me.

25:46.129 --> 25:49.007
Dreamt of you last night.

25:49.132 --> 25:53.387
- Fell out of bed twice!
- Ta-ra! I love ya!

25:54.054 --> 25:55.597
Why do you love me?

25:56.348 --> 25:58.350
Cos you're daft!

26:16.702 --> 26:19.037
- is that you, Jo?
- Yeah.

26:19.163 --> 26:21.498
Well, you're late. Where've you been?

26:21.623 --> 26:23.667
I met a friend.

26:23.792 --> 26:28.046
Oh! Well, he certainly knows
how to put pink in your cheeks.

26:28.172 --> 26:29.882
What makes you think it's a he?

26:30.007 --> 26:34.595
I certainly hope it isn't a she that makes
you walk around in this enraptured fashion.

26:34.678 --> 26:36.722
He's a sailor.

26:36.847 --> 26:41.393
Well, I hope you exercised proper control
over his nautical ardour.

26:42.769 --> 26:45.981
Jo, I’ve got summat to tell you.

26:47.149 --> 26:49.318
Jo, I’m gonna get married again.

26:52.988 --> 26:57.117
- is it that Peter Smith?
- He's the unlucky man, yes.

26:57.201 --> 26:59.661
You're centuries older than him.

26:59.828 --> 27:01.997
D'you mind? I’m only eight years.

27:02.122 --> 27:05.459
What use can a woman of your age
be to anybody?

27:05.542 --> 27:08.795
Don't talk about me
as if I’m an impotent old woman!

27:08.879 --> 27:12.174
- You're not exactly a child bride.
- I was once.

27:12.299 --> 27:15.636
I hope to be dead and buried
by the time I reach your age.

27:15.719 --> 27:17.888
Just think, you've been living for 40 years!

27:17.971 --> 27:21.266
I know. I must be a biological phenomenon!

27:21.350 --> 27:23.727
You don't look 40.

27:23.810 --> 27:26.313
You look a sort of well-preserved 60.

27:26.438 --> 27:28.899
Ooh, you're a cheeky monkey, you are!

27:29.399 --> 27:30.567
Anyway,

27:30.651 --> 27:33.779
we're off to Blackpool this weekend.

27:33.904 --> 27:36.448
You're not leaving me here on me own?

27:36.573 --> 27:39.159
You've been on your own before now.

27:39.243 --> 27:40.911
Well, I’m coming with you this time.

27:41.036 --> 27:43.455
All right, if you want to, love.

27:54.341 --> 27:56.593
I’ve got something for you.

27:56.718 --> 27:58.720
What is it?

27:58.846 --> 28:00.889
A ring!

28:04.393 --> 28:06.645
What will your mother say?

28:06.770 --> 28:09.481
Don't care what she says.

28:11.024 --> 28:12.276
- She doesn't know I’m...?
- No.

28:12.401 --> 28:14.820
Whatever else she might be,
she isn't prejudiced.

28:14.945 --> 28:17.614
You're not worried about it, are you?

28:18.782 --> 28:21.410
Well, so long as you like it.

28:21.535 --> 28:23.745
You know I do.

28:35.549 --> 28:39.803
Here, this ring, it's too big.
Couldn't wear it for school, anyway.

28:39.887 --> 28:43.056
Let's go all romantic. Got a piece of string?

28:43.140 --> 28:45.350
Come on, turn out your pockets.

28:45.517 --> 28:50.063
Gosh, don't little boys carry some trash?
Hey, what's this?

28:50.147 --> 28:52.316
- Just a toy car.
- Can I try it?

28:52.441 --> 28:54.484
Go on, then.

28:57.821 --> 29:00.365
No, goes like this, look.

29:02.576 --> 29:04.620
I like that.

29:04.745 --> 29:06.747
Can I keep it?

29:07.748 --> 29:10.501
Take it. My soul and all. Everything!

29:10.584 --> 29:13.086
Thanks. I know.

29:13.170 --> 29:15.464
I can use my hair ribbon for me ring.

29:21.803 --> 29:24.014
Do it up for me.

29:26.934 --> 29:28.977
Pretty neck you've got.

29:29.102 --> 29:32.731
Glad you like it.
it’s my schoolgirl complexion.

29:33.482 --> 29:35.609
Oh, I must go home.

29:52.292 --> 29:55.921
- I’II just go and hurry her up.
- All right, love.

30:05.389 --> 30:07.766
Hey, aren't you ready?
Bert and Doris are waiting.

30:07.850 --> 30:09.893
I won't be a minute, love.

30:13.897 --> 30:17.484
- You wearing your blue garters?
- Oh, stop it.

30:23.365 --> 30:24.741
Hello, Daddy

30:27.828 --> 30:30.038
You've told her, then.

30:30.205 --> 30:34.376
Yes. Now, would you mind going in there
and leaving me alone for a minute?

30:35.836 --> 30:37.171
What's she all dressed up for?

30:39.214 --> 30:41.175
I’m coming with you, Mr Smith.

30:42.509 --> 30:44.511
That's right.

30:44.595 --> 30:46.847
it was a bit awkward, lovely.

30:46.972 --> 30:51.101
- I bought her these chocolates.
- Well, give them to her, go on.

30:54.438 --> 30:57.649
- Well, here y'are.
- Trying to buy me off, eh?

30:57.733 --> 31:00.360
Well, I’m still coming with you.

31:00.485 --> 31:04.281
Now come on, you two, go in the other room
while I finish me toilet.

31:04.406 --> 31:06.450
I won't be a minute, really I won't.

31:06.575 --> 31:10.704
Make up to him, love, and be nice.
He brought you some chocolates!

31:11.121 --> 31:15.542
Don't get impatient, Mr Smith.
The artwork takes a long time.

31:21.173 --> 31:23.175
Joey, Joey, Joey!

31:46.073 --> 31:48.408
Why d'you have a glass eye?

31:50.327 --> 31:52.913
Er... I lost one during the war.

31:52.996 --> 31:55.415
And can you take that eye out?

31:56.083 --> 31:58.126
Don't ask daft questions!

31:58.460 --> 32:00.462
D'you wear it when you go to bed?

32:03.924 --> 32:08.387
Well, there's one highly recommended way
for a young lady to find out.

32:10.347 --> 32:11.807
Oh, d'you fancy me?

32:12.599 --> 32:14.601
No, thanks.

32:14.685 --> 32:16.353
You prefer old women.

32:16.436 --> 32:18.480
Well, that's love, innit?

32:20.107 --> 32:24.778
- You don't like your mother much, do you?
- She doesn't much care for me.

32:24.862 --> 32:26.905
I’m not surprised.

32:27.865 --> 32:29.116
Hey!

32:32.786 --> 32:35.789
You sure you lost that eye during the war?

32:41.128 --> 32:44.464
- Are you married?
- No, I’m still available.

32:44.548 --> 32:48.302
- But only just. How do I look?
- Fantastic. Come on.

32:48.385 --> 32:52.306
Come on, love, and put your face straight
for goodness' sake.

32:53.307 --> 32:55.350
Robin Hood and his merry men

32:55.475 --> 32:57.978
Went to school and back again
The teacher said you're late again...

32:58.103 --> 33:01.523
Do we have to have her tagging along?
Bloody little nuisance!

33:01.648 --> 33:04.318
- Don't talk about her like that!
- Bloody happy family!

33:04.401 --> 33:08.322
- Anyway, there won't be room in the car.
- We can squeeze her in.

33:15.245 --> 33:17.623
- I’m coming!
- Come on, Helen!

33:17.706 --> 33:19.791
I want to fix these shoes, they're...

33:19.917 --> 33:23.086
- Jo, come on!
- Ooh, you look lovely!

33:23.170 --> 33:26.340
Jo, this is Doris, Doris, this is Jo.

33:26.465 --> 33:30.385
- Come on, get in!
- Oh, shut up, you bad-tempered thing!

33:35.516 --> 33:38.519
- Looks as though it might be a lovely day.
- Hope it stops fine.

33:38.602 --> 33:40.854
it’s no more than we deserve.

33:40.979 --> 33:43.982
- Well, you're the lucky one, aren't you?
- What d'you mean, love?

33:44.066 --> 33:47.945
Little lady's big surprise.
What d'you think about that?

33:50.364 --> 33:53.158
is this for us? Where'd you find it?

33:53.283 --> 33:56.620
One of the lads at the club
wanted to sell it so I bought it.

33:56.745 --> 33:58.789
Oh, isn't it lovely?

33:58.872 --> 34:03.669
Look, a bungalow with bay windows
and crazy paving.

34:03.710 --> 34:05.796
Oh, look, Jo.

34:07.589 --> 34:11.677
it’s all right.
Certainly fixed up things behind my back.

34:18.391 --> 34:21.103
# The time comes along, and I

34:21.186 --> 34:23.272
# Knock the guy that say that it's a crime

34:23.313 --> 34:25.815
# I’m gonna grab it, our habit

34:25.899 --> 34:28.318
# Why not, why not, why not?

34:28.735 --> 34:32.072
# Guess some fun's in sight on a party night

34:32.156 --> 34:34.366
# What's it matter
what they're singing about?

34:34.491 --> 34:36.952
# I’m gonna grab it, our habit

34:36.994 --> 34:39.705
# Why not, why not, why not?

34:39.788 --> 34:43.125
# So if a pretty chick is possible

34:43.250 --> 34:46.295
- # To get to the other side
- Come on!

34:46.420 --> 34:49.380
# That pretty chick better jump down quick...

35:56.114 --> 35:58.200
# Baby, baby, you're so square

35:58.283 --> 35:59.993
# Things you do really get in my hair

36:00.118 --> 36:02.120
# You dig that jazz like no one do

36:02.204 --> 36:04.873
# I wanna rock and roll with you, let's rock

36:06.124 --> 36:08.168
# Let's rock

36:08.252 --> 36:10.045
# Let down your hair

36:10.170 --> 36:12.214
# Don't be a square

36:17.177 --> 36:19.137
'Now we have Fascination
by Van Gogh,

36:19.263 --> 36:22.182
which now hangs
in the Louvre gallery in Paris.'

36:23.058 --> 36:27.145
Here we have our lovely Lorraine
in her exotic, exciting pose

36:27.229 --> 36:30.357
as a provocative
provoking provocation.

36:30.482 --> 36:33.652
We hope she'll be our guest artiste
for the rest of the season.

36:33.735 --> 36:36.446
And now, in comparison,

36:36.530 --> 36:40.367
here is the ugly blackened shell
of the Parisian Georgette.

36:40.450 --> 36:44.955
She used to play Cinderella, but
she took to drugs and excessive alcohol.

36:45.080 --> 36:49.543
Now she couldn't even play
the wick in Aladdin's lamp.

36:49.960 --> 36:53.922
And now a short scene
from the famous film Dracula.

36:53.964 --> 36:56.049
Die, girl, die!

36:56.175 --> 36:58.719
That was the vampire strangling his...

36:58.802 --> 37:01.138
..I mean her victim.

37:03.765 --> 37:07.352
And now we have Fascination
by Van Gogh,

37:07.519 --> 37:11.523
which now hangs
in the Louvre gallery in Paris.

37:11.607 --> 37:13.609
'Fascination. '

37:14.359 --> 37:17.237
# Let's slip away

37:17.321 --> 37:19.364
# Somewhere quiet

37:19.740 --> 37:22.367
# Let's slip away

37:22.493 --> 37:25.662
# And live on a diet of love

37:25.746 --> 37:29.082
# And kisses all day

37:30.209 --> 37:33.504
# Slip away, slip away

37:34.671 --> 37:36.840
# Let's slip away

37:38.133 --> 37:40.219
# Let's play truant

37:40.344 --> 37:44.223
# Let's go today, just ask me and... #

37:44.348 --> 37:48.769
Oh, look, there's the gypsy that
told me fortune last year, she's wonderful.

37:48.810 --> 37:52.314
- I never believe a word they say.
- Hey, where you going?

37:52.481 --> 37:54.483
it’II be raining again in a minute.

37:54.608 --> 37:56.610
They'll be half an hour now.

38:15.712 --> 38:18.882
D'you feel like that about me, Mr Smith?

38:20.467 --> 38:23.554
Or must we wait until we're alone
for an answer?

38:23.637 --> 38:27.349
- Will you behave yourself!
- I’m getting wet and I’m tired.

38:27.474 --> 38:31.770
I’m not surprised. The way you're guzzling
them chocolates I wonder you're not sick.

38:31.854 --> 38:34.731
- Don't boss me about, you're not me father!
- Ah, get lost and leave us alone!

38:34.815 --> 38:38.068
You leave me alone
and leave my mother alone, too!

38:38.152 --> 38:40.946
I know you're planning to run off
with my old woman.

38:41.071 --> 38:43.949
- What you gonna do about me?
- Hey, me blazer!

38:44.074 --> 38:47.494
Oh! I’II knock your head in,
you jealous little cat!

38:47.578 --> 38:51.290
She's always like this
if I’m affectionate with anybody.

38:51.415 --> 38:54.334
- You've never been affectionate with me.
- That's no way to talk to your mother.

38:54.418 --> 38:58.046
- Shut up!
- You've really upset Peter now, you have.

39:00.757 --> 39:04.386
Now send the kid home!
I won't spend another minute with her.

39:04.511 --> 39:07.472
I feel properly embarrassed
in front of Bert and Doris.

39:09.183 --> 39:13.145
Well, she's been on her own before.
I suppose she'll be all right.

39:13.270 --> 39:17.441
Come on, make up your mind!
Either she goes or I do. Now, which is it?

39:24.948 --> 39:27.951
You've properly upset Peter.
You've got to go home.

39:28.035 --> 39:28.827
Come on, Helen!

39:28.911 --> 39:31.205
Oh, stop shouting!

39:31.330 --> 39:35.209
I’m gonna give her some money
so she can get home. Here you are, love.

39:35.334 --> 39:37.711
Shall I come to the bus stop with you?

39:37.794 --> 39:40.380
I can find me own way to the bus stop.
Don't treat me like a baby.

39:40.464 --> 39:43.675
- Go back to your friends!
- Oh, you do show me up, you do!

39:43.759 --> 39:46.053
You will be all right though, won't you?

39:46.178 --> 39:49.473
it’s not the first time you've gone away.
Don't get a conscience now!

39:49.556 --> 39:50.557
Come on!

39:54.186 --> 39:59.775
And another thing, we're not having her
living with us! Now think on that!

40:31.849 --> 40:33.141
Jo!

40:36.603 --> 40:37.729
Jo!

40:44.611 --> 40:45.779
Jo!

41:00.043 --> 41:02.296
What's the matter? Have you been crying?

41:02.421 --> 41:07.092
No. Oh, you would have to be here
when I feel such a mess!

41:21.106 --> 41:24.026
Listen to that. I’II be gone soon.

41:24.067 --> 41:26.236
Me heart's broke

41:26.320 --> 41:30.240
You can lie in bed and hear me ship
passing down the old canal.

41:36.622 --> 41:38.707
is my ring still round your neck?

41:38.749 --> 41:40.209
Yes.

41:40.292 --> 41:43.712
- Well, wear it, then.
- Unfasten it, then.

41:43.837 --> 41:46.840
- Pretty neck you've got.
- Glad you like it.

41:48.509 --> 41:50.594
Let me put it on.

41:51.762 --> 41:53.889
Did it cost you very much?

41:54.014 --> 41:56.016
Shouldn't ask questions like that.

41:56.141 --> 41:59.186
- I got it in Woolworth!
- Woolworth's best, eh?

41:59.311 --> 42:01.980
I don't care. it’s the thought that counts.

42:02.064 --> 42:06.527
I wonder what the thought was
in your wicked mind that made you buy it?

42:28.966 --> 42:31.009
Will you stay with me?

42:34.221 --> 42:36.557
If that's what you want.

42:41.645 --> 42:43.897
That's what you want.

42:45.107 --> 42:47.401
Probably never see you again. I know it.

42:48.318 --> 42:50.404
What makes you say that?

42:50.487 --> 42:52.656
I just know it, that's all.

42:52.781 --> 42:54.867
But I don't care.

42:55.576 --> 42:58.245
Stay with me now. it’s enough.

42:58.328 --> 43:00.622
And if you do come back I’II still be here.

43:01.582 --> 43:03.709
I’II come back.

43:03.792 --> 43:05.836
Anyway,

43:06.170 --> 43:09.673
after this, perhaps you might not
want to come back.

43:11.592 --> 43:15.095
After all, I’m not very experienced
in these little matters.

43:16.013 --> 43:18.098
I am.

43:18.182 --> 43:20.267
Don't do that.

43:20.392 --> 43:22.394
Why not?

43:23.020 --> 43:25.022
I like it.

43:54.968 --> 43:58.347
Well, I must go. Are you all right?

43:59.139 --> 44:02.434
Course I’m all right. You'd better hurry up.

44:03.060 --> 44:06.647
- We sail sometime this afternoon.
- Today?

44:06.730 --> 44:09.900
- Yes. Don't forget me.
- I won't.

44:09.983 --> 44:13.487
- See you.
- Come on there, hurry up!

46:24.535 --> 46:27.329
# Oh, dear, what can the matter be?

46:27.412 --> 46:29.706
# Three old ladies got locked in a lavatory

46:29.790 --> 46:32.292
# They were there from Monday to Saturday

46:32.376 --> 46:35.462
# Nobody knew they were there #

46:35.879 --> 46:38.799
Jo, are you still in bed? it’s three o'clock.

46:45.013 --> 46:49.268
- The sun's shining.
- Yes. Happy the bride the sun shines on.

46:49.685 --> 46:52.855
And happy the corpse the rain rains on.

46:54.815 --> 46:56.817
Where you going, anyway?

46:56.900 --> 46:59.194
I’ve come to get my things.
I’m gonna get married.

46:59.319 --> 47:02.990
Really? You're not getting married
in a church, are you?

47:03.073 --> 47:07.286
Why, you coming to throw bricks at us?
Course I’m not.

47:07.369 --> 47:09.413
Hey, Jo.

47:09.496 --> 47:10.914
Jo.

47:11.290 --> 47:13.333
How d'you like this?

47:13.417 --> 47:16.128
Bet somebody's missing their cat.

47:16.211 --> 47:19.214
it’s a present from that young man of mine.

47:19.298 --> 47:23.260
You would catch cold, wouldn't you?
Use your hankie.

47:23.343 --> 47:25.888
- I haven't got one.
- Use mine, then.

47:28.265 --> 47:30.976
- What are you trying to hide?
- Nothing.

47:31.018 --> 47:34.479
- Let's have a look.
- Let go, you're hurting me!

47:34.605 --> 47:36.899
- What's this?
- A ring.

47:37.024 --> 47:40.027
I can see it's a ring.
Who's given it you?

47:40.110 --> 47:41.778
The man I’m gonna marry.

47:42.946 --> 47:44.907
Silly little bitch!

47:45.032 --> 47:48.160
You mean that sailor lad
you've been knocking about with?

47:48.285 --> 47:52.998
- Has he really asked you to marry him?
- Yes. We're as good as married.

47:53.123 --> 47:57.044
You know where this belongs?
In the ash can with everything else!

47:57.127 --> 47:59.338
I could kill you, I could really!

47:59.421 --> 48:01.215
You've already had a damn good try!

48:01.340 --> 48:05.260
Oh, Jo, why can't you learn
from my mistakes?

48:05.385 --> 48:08.138
it takes half your lifetime
to learn from your own.

48:08.222 --> 48:11.016
Oh, what a thing to happen!

48:11.099 --> 48:15.854
As soon as me back's turned you'll be off
with that sailor lad and ruin yourself.

48:15.938 --> 48:19.149
Don't worry, Helen. He's gone away.

48:19.233 --> 48:22.402
I’II probably never see him again
for months.

48:22.486 --> 48:25.405
Oh, Jo, love.

48:25.489 --> 48:27.574
You're only young.

48:27.699 --> 48:30.869
Why don't you enjoy your life?
Don't get trapped.

48:30.994 --> 48:33.497
Marriage can be murder for a kid.

48:33.622 --> 48:36.416
Oh, give me your hankie back.

48:42.464 --> 48:46.134
- Where's your husband?
- He's outside waiting for me.

48:46.677 --> 48:48.679
Ooh, I say, look at that.

48:48.762 --> 48:51.682
Every line tells a dirty story.

48:54.142 --> 48:56.270
- Helen?
- Yeah?

48:57.771 --> 48:59.857
What was me father like?

48:59.982 --> 49:02.860
- Who?
- Me father.

49:02.985 --> 49:05.279
Oh, him.

49:05.362 --> 49:08.699
Was he so horrible
that you can't even tell me about him?

49:08.824 --> 49:13.412
No, he wasn't horrible.
He was just a bit simple, that's all.

49:13.579 --> 49:16.540
- Are you serious?
- Course I’m serious.

49:16.665 --> 49:18.876
You're a liar!

49:18.959 --> 49:20.711
Am I?

49:24.882 --> 49:28.177
- No.
- So now you know.

49:31.805 --> 49:36.685
- Was he... a real idiot?
- Well, he wasn't daft, he was...

49:37.561 --> 49:40.939
I don't know. He'd got funny eyes.

49:41.023 --> 49:43.066
You've got them.

49:44.401 --> 49:48.071
- I’ve no time to waste here.
- Where is he now?

49:48.155 --> 49:51.617
- Locked up?
- Course not. He's dead.

49:51.783 --> 49:53.327
Why?

49:53.410 --> 49:56.413
Why? Don't ask me why.

49:56.497 --> 49:59.124
Death comes to us all sooner or later.

49:59.249 --> 50:01.710
Oh, I must go.

50:07.174 --> 50:09.343
Madness is hereditary, isn't it?

50:09.468 --> 50:12.679
Oh, for God's sake, Jo.

50:12.763 --> 50:15.849
Decide for yourself
whether you're mad or not.

50:15.933 --> 50:18.769
Course you're not mad,
and neither was he.

50:18.852 --> 50:21.396
You said he was an 'alfwit.

50:21.522 --> 50:24.817
How could you go with an 'alfwit?

50:25.984 --> 50:30.739
I don't know. Everybody used to laugh
at him but I thought he was rather nice.

50:30.906 --> 50:32.908
Tell me.

50:32.991 --> 50:35.118
I want to understand.

50:35.202 --> 50:37.329
Look, Jo.

50:37.830 --> 50:39.998
For one night,

50:40.123 --> 50:42.459
well, actually it was the afternoon,

50:42.584 --> 50:44.336
I loved him.

50:45.754 --> 50:48.632
I’d never really been with a man before.

50:48.715 --> 50:50.717
it was the first time.

50:52.344 --> 50:54.596
You can remember the second

50:54.721 --> 50:56.765
and the third

50:56.890 --> 50:58.934
and the fourth time.

51:00.060 --> 51:02.187
But there's no time like the first.

51:03.730 --> 51:05.774
it’s always there.

51:09.403 --> 51:13.490
Oh, it's no good, love, I’ve got to go.
Peter's gonna kill me.

51:14.324 --> 51:16.910
Aren't you sorry to see me go?

51:17.244 --> 51:19.246
I’m not sorry and I’m not glad.

51:19.329 --> 51:21.790
I’m not gonna wait for you to come back.

51:21.874 --> 51:24.126
Well, suit yourself, then.

51:25.627 --> 51:28.463
And think on, take summat for that cold.

51:35.470 --> 51:38.891
I say, what a smasher!

51:39.016 --> 51:42.311
Look at Gertie getting fatter!

51:42.394 --> 51:45.731
Find a stick and throw it at her!

51:46.023 --> 51:49.026
I say, what a smasher!

51:49.151 --> 51:52.654
- Look at Gertie getting fatter
- I’II give you a clout across the earhole!

51:52.779 --> 51:55.449
Find a brick and throw it at her...

51:56.074 --> 51:59.369
- Good luck, Helen.
- Aren't you going to kiss me goodbye?

51:59.453 --> 52:01.997
- it seems ages since you kissed me.
- Save it for him.

52:02.080 --> 52:04.917
- You will be all right, love, won't you?
- Course I’II be all right.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.211
I’ve got a job starting on Monday
in a shoe shop.

52:07.294 --> 52:10.172
Yes, well, I’II see you
when the honeymoon's over. Ta-ra, love.

52:10.297 --> 52:12.090
Ta-ra.

52:13.050 --> 52:15.344
# And a face I do not know

52:15.802 --> 52:18.889
# Oh, Betty Grable is a star, S-T-A-R

52:18.972 --> 52:21.642
Look at Gertie getting fatter!

52:21.725 --> 52:25.145
Get a brick and throw it at her!

52:25.229 --> 52:28.273
I say, what a smasher...

52:43.956 --> 52:45.999
No, no, I don't care for them.

52:46.124 --> 52:48.919
- I’II look for some more.
- No, don't bother.

52:49.044 --> 52:51.004
You haven't got much of a stock here.

52:51.088 --> 52:53.298
Perhaps we can order something for you.

52:53.423 --> 52:57.845
No, thank you, I’II go up to the centre.
They've got more fashions there.

52:57.928 --> 53:00.806
Oh, you've got to get used to all sorts, love.

53:00.931 --> 53:04.685
When you've been here a week or two,
her sort won't bother you at all.

53:04.768 --> 53:06.854
She made me get all the stock out.

53:06.937 --> 53:09.898
- I haven't made one sale yet.
- Give yourself time.

53:10.023 --> 53:13.277
Oh, Jo, I’ve got to go out.
Lock up for me, will you?

53:13.402 --> 53:16.029
Yes, but if you don't mind
I’II make it six on the dot.

53:16.113 --> 53:20.534
I’m going to see some rooms I’m thinking
of moving into. I fancy a change.

53:20.617 --> 53:23.120
- Ah, well, good night.
- Night.

53:38.468 --> 53:40.262
Can I help you?

53:40.387 --> 53:44.057
- Yes, I want a pair of shoes.
- What sort of shoes?

53:44.141 --> 53:45.976
Have you got any of them Italian...

53:46.059 --> 53:48.228
- Casuals?
- Yeah.

53:48.312 --> 53:50.689
- What size?
- Eight.

53:51.732 --> 53:54.359
- Any particular colour?
- No.

53:56.361 --> 53:58.739
Hey, but nothing too startling.

53:58.822 --> 54:01.074
Mm, these are nice.

54:01.158 --> 54:03.410
Oh, aye. Can I try 'em?

54:08.499 --> 54:11.084
- Fit all right?
- Yeah, they're very comfortable.

54:11.210 --> 54:12.586
Are they very expensive?

54:12.669 --> 54:14.922
Not really. They're in the sale, 18 bob.

54:15.047 --> 54:19.051
- They're not bad, are they?
- No, I think they look very smart.

54:19.092 --> 54:22.137
They really cost 24/11,
so you got a real bargain.

54:22.262 --> 54:24.765
Well, I’II have 'em. Ta.

54:28.018 --> 54:31.647
Hey, you needn't bother to wrap 'em.
They'll go in there.

54:34.274 --> 54:36.819
I think you'll find them very nice
for the summer.

54:36.944 --> 54:38.987
- If we have any.
- Mm.

54:40.113 --> 54:42.574
Two bob change. Just right.

54:42.616 --> 54:44.743
Thank you.

54:45.410 --> 54:47.746
- Ta-ra.
- Ta-ra.

55:09.977 --> 55:12.187
Here we are.

55:14.148 --> 55:16.358
You'll have to clean it up a bit.

55:21.905 --> 55:23.907
Won't it be too big for you?

55:23.991 --> 55:27.119
No, this is just nice.
I’ve always wanted a place of me own.

55:27.244 --> 55:30.164
- 30 bob a week, is it?
- That's it.

55:30.289 --> 55:32.332
Collect on Fridays, I suppose.

55:32.457 --> 55:35.586
Aye, payday.
I’m in there while they've still got it.

55:35.669 --> 55:39.381
- I can give it you in advance.
- Oh, ta, love.

55:41.049 --> 55:42.384
30 bob.

55:42.509 --> 55:44.761
You move in whenever you like.

57:00.462 --> 57:02.756
- 'Ello!
- 'Ello!

57:17.062 --> 57:19.189
Fancy seeing you here. You enjoying it?

57:19.273 --> 57:21.817
- Yes, I always do.
- So do I.

57:21.900 --> 57:24.528
Hey, them shoes are ever so comfortable.

57:24.611 --> 57:26.780
Yes, they look very smart.

57:27.197 --> 57:29.741
- Are you by yourself?
- Yes.

57:29.825 --> 57:31.869
Would you like to go to the fair?

57:31.952 --> 57:35.539
- Oh, I’d love to.
- Would you? Oh, come on!

58:41.522 --> 58:45.859
I haven't been to a fair since Christmas.
Thanks, Geoff.

58:45.984 --> 58:48.028
I loved it.

58:48.695 --> 58:51.073
- Good night.
- Good night.

58:56.036 --> 58:58.372
- Good night.
- Good night.

59:10.050 --> 59:11.218
Hey!

59:11.343 --> 59:13.971
Haven't you got an 'ome to go to?

59:14.054 --> 59:15.806
Well, of course I have!

59:15.889 --> 59:19.726
Then what are you lurking about for
down there?

59:19.810 --> 59:22.396
Come on in if you're coming.

59:58.056 --> 01:00:02.227
- Hey, d'you want the light on?
- No, don't you dare put that light on!

01:00:03.061 --> 01:00:05.314
Hey, this place is enormous, in't it?

01:00:05.439 --> 01:00:08.942
I know.
Got to work hard all week to pay for it.

01:00:09.026 --> 01:00:12.446
it’s the only place I’ve ever had
that's all mine and nobody else's.

01:00:12.529 --> 01:00:14.573
Bit big for one though, in't it, Jo?

01:00:14.656 --> 01:00:18.202
- Why, thinking of moving in?
- Oh, not likely!

01:00:18.744 --> 01:00:23.123
- Haven't you got an 'ome to go to?
- No, me landlady threw me out.

01:00:23.207 --> 01:00:25.292
- Why?
- Mind your own business.

01:00:25.375 --> 01:00:28.712
- You can stay here if you tell me.
- I was behind with the rent.

01:00:28.795 --> 01:00:31.381
- That's a lie for a start.
- No, it's not!

01:00:31.465 --> 01:00:33.759
Oh, come on, Geoffrey Ingham.

01:00:33.842 --> 01:00:36.470
Let's have a bit of light on the subject.

01:00:37.513 --> 01:00:41.809
- Who did she find you with, your girlfriend?
- Of course not.

01:00:42.893 --> 01:00:45.062
'Ey, it wasn't a man, was it?

01:00:47.105 --> 01:00:48.899
Look,

01:00:48.982 --> 01:00:52.277
I’ve got a nice comfortable couch.
I’ve even got some sheets.

01:00:52.361 --> 01:00:55.322
You can stay if you tell me what you do.

01:00:55.405 --> 01:00:59.076
Go on, Geoffrey. I’ve always wanted
to know about people like you.

01:00:59.201 --> 01:01:02.120
- Go to hell!
- 'Ey, I won't snigger, honest I won't.

01:01:02.204 --> 01:01:04.206
Tell me some of it, go on.

01:01:04.289 --> 01:01:06.583
I bet you never told a woman before.

01:01:07.709 --> 01:01:11.004
I don't go in for sensational confessions.

01:01:11.046 --> 01:01:12.965
I want to know what you do.

01:01:13.006 --> 01:01:15.133
I want to know why you do it.

01:01:15.217 --> 01:01:17.803
Well, tell me or get out!

01:01:17.886 --> 01:01:19.096
Right.

01:01:21.181 --> 01:01:24.768
Oh, Geoff, don't go, Geoff. I’m sorry.
Please stay.

01:01:24.893 --> 01:01:27.187
Get off! I can't stand women at times.

01:01:27.271 --> 01:01:30.065
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

01:01:30.149 --> 01:01:34.945
Come on, Geoff. I’II get those sheets
and blankets and make up a bed for you.

01:01:36.488 --> 01:01:39.533
I don't care what you do. Honest I don't.

01:01:40.701 --> 01:01:42.911
Please stay, Geoff.

01:01:44.121 --> 01:01:46.165
Please.

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:10.689
- I’ve only got one blanket. is that enough?
- Oh, yes, that'll do.

01:02:10.731 --> 01:02:13.775
- What you gonna sleep in?
- Me shirt.

01:02:13.859 --> 01:02:16.653
Ooh, I don't think you'll be very comfy
on this couch.

01:02:16.737 --> 01:02:18.614
Beggars can't be choosers.

01:02:18.697 --> 01:02:22.075
- Aye, we're both beggars.
- Aye, the devil's own.

01:02:23.368 --> 01:02:25.954
Ooh, you are mucky and messy, aren't you?

01:02:26.038 --> 01:02:28.916
- You need taking in hand, you do.
- Ooh, no, thanks!

01:02:28.999 --> 01:02:31.210
- Has anyone ever tried?
- What?

01:02:31.293 --> 01:02:33.545
- Taking you in hand.
- Yeah.

01:02:33.629 --> 01:02:35.672
What happened to him?

01:02:35.756 --> 01:02:39.051
Oh, I’m that tired
I can hardly get myself to bed.

01:02:39.134 --> 01:02:42.679
Let me lie down
and don't wake me up for a month.

01:02:43.639 --> 01:02:46.016
What time have you got to be up?

01:02:46.141 --> 01:02:50.646
- I don't go to school tomorrow.
- School? What d'you do at school?

01:02:50.729 --> 01:02:53.816
- Textile design.
- Oh, one of them.

01:02:53.857 --> 01:02:55.984
Here, I tell you what.

01:02:56.068 --> 01:02:59.655
I’II stay here and tidy the place up a bit.
Get you a proper meal.

01:03:00.656 --> 01:03:02.407
'Ey!

01:03:02.491 --> 01:03:05.953
Better put that light off.
I might be after you!

01:03:25.222 --> 01:03:28.100
- 'Night, Geoffrey.
- Good night.

01:03:38.652 --> 01:03:39.653
Geoff?

01:03:39.736 --> 01:03:41.738
Oh, go to sleep!

01:03:41.822 --> 01:03:44.199
- Geoffrey!
- What?

01:03:44.283 --> 01:03:47.619
You're just like a big sister to me.

01:03:55.419 --> 01:03:57.504
Hey, you're home early.

01:03:57.629 --> 01:04:00.215
- Dinner isn't quite ready. Won't be long.
- Where is it?

01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:02.509
In the oven. Hey, get off!

01:04:24.990 --> 01:04:27.284
- Quite nice, in't it?
- Yeah.

01:04:30.537 --> 01:04:33.123
What's that, a self-portrait?

01:04:42.049 --> 01:04:44.009
Jo!

01:04:46.970 --> 01:04:48.388
No!

01:04:49.515 --> 01:04:51.809
Put your hand up.
The other back up.

01:04:52.851 --> 01:04:55.145
Right. Now keep it.

01:05:09.868 --> 01:05:12.412
You might have washed 'em first.

01:05:28.846 --> 01:05:30.639
Don't forget your ears!

01:05:33.308 --> 01:05:35.936
Oh, Jo went early and it's her half-day.

01:05:39.231 --> 01:05:42.818
- 'Ey, you seen Jo?
- She's up the arches.

01:05:52.161 --> 01:05:56.456
Hey, I’ve been looking for you.
I’ve cooked dinner, don't you want it?

01:05:56.582 --> 01:06:00.294
- I don't fancy anything.
- Well, I haven't poisoned you up till now.

01:06:00.377 --> 01:06:02.504
I don't want anything to eat.

01:06:05.591 --> 01:06:07.634
I’m gonna have a baby.

01:06:07.718 --> 01:06:09.761
Yes, I thought so.

01:06:09.845 --> 01:06:13.682
- You're in a bit of a mess, aren't you?
- Oh, I don't care.

01:06:13.765 --> 01:06:16.268
You can get rid of babies
before they're born, you know.

01:06:16.351 --> 01:06:18.729
Yes, I know, but I think that's terrible.

01:06:18.812 --> 01:06:22.065
- When's it due?
- About November.

01:06:22.149 --> 01:06:25.277
- Your mother should know.
- Why?

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:28.405
You'll have to buy clothes,
a cot and a pram...

01:06:28.489 --> 01:06:32.993
Oh, shut up! I’m not planning big plans
for this baby or dreaming big dreams.

01:06:33.035 --> 01:06:36.580
You know what happens
when you do things like that?

01:06:36.705 --> 01:06:40.334
This baby will be born dead or daft or...

01:06:42.836 --> 01:06:45.714
You're just feeling a bit depressed, that's all.

01:06:45.756 --> 01:06:49.384
You'll be your usual self
once you get used to the idea.

01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:51.762
And what is my usual self?

01:06:51.845 --> 01:06:56.517
My usual self is a very unusual self,
and don't you forget that, Geoffrey Ingham!

01:06:56.600 --> 01:07:00.521
I’m an extraordinary person!
There's only one of me and only one of you!

01:07:00.646 --> 01:07:02.689
- We're unique!
- Young!

01:07:02.773 --> 01:07:04.399
- Unrivalled!
- Smashing!

01:07:04.483 --> 01:07:05.943
We're bloody marvellous!

01:07:06.068 --> 01:07:09.154
'Ey, Geoff, it's me half-day.
How would you like to go to the country?

01:07:09.196 --> 01:07:11.240
Wonderful! 'Ey, come on!

01:07:37.599 --> 01:07:40.310
'Ey, d'you want some chocolate?

01:07:40.394 --> 01:07:43.856
'Ey, go on, it's strawberry cream,
you like that.

01:07:44.439 --> 01:07:46.608
Here y'are.

01:07:56.118 --> 01:07:58.370
'Ey, what would you say
if I started something?

01:07:58.453 --> 01:08:00.747
- Eh?
- What would you do if I started something?

01:08:00.914 --> 01:08:03.625
- In my condition, probably faint.
- No, I mean after.

01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:08.130
- I don't want you, Geoff.
- Well, am I repulsive to you?

01:08:08.213 --> 01:08:10.841
You're nothing to me.
I’m everything to meself.

01:08:10.924 --> 01:08:13.802
- You need me, Jo.
- Let go, you're hurting me!

01:08:17.139 --> 01:08:20.434
- Will you let me kiss you, Jo?
- Oh, leave me alone!

01:08:27.399 --> 01:08:29.984
Well, I didn't mean to hurt you, Jo.

01:08:30.068 --> 01:08:32.446
I like you, Geoff.

01:08:32.529 --> 01:08:35.698
- I like you, but...
- Will you marry me?

01:08:35.782 --> 01:08:37.326
I’m not marrying anybody.

01:08:37.408 --> 01:08:40.120
Well, just for the baby's sake.

01:08:40.203 --> 01:08:43.165
I’m going down to the caves.

01:08:49.296 --> 01:08:53.926
When the water reaches the caves,
it deposits lime,

01:08:54.009 --> 01:08:57.805
which forms stalactites on the roof,
stalagmites on the floor

01:08:57.845 --> 01:09:03.477
and covers the walls all over as it is doing
mostly, as you can see, in this chamber.

01:09:04.478 --> 01:09:06.647
The lovely colours are made

01:09:06.772 --> 01:09:09.858
by iron and copper staining the lime.

01:09:12.319 --> 01:09:14.654
What was he like, Jo?

01:09:14.738 --> 01:09:17.533
He wasn't a bit like you.

01:09:17.616 --> 01:09:21.662
He could sing and dance.
He was black as coal.

01:09:21.745 --> 01:09:24.288
- A black boy?
- From darkest Africa.

01:09:24.372 --> 01:09:26.834
- A prince.
- A what?

01:09:26.959 --> 01:09:29.294
A prince, son of a chieftain.

01:09:29.377 --> 01:09:32.548
- I’II bet he was, too
- Prince Ossini.

01:09:33.215 --> 01:09:35.259
D'you love him?

01:09:35.926 --> 01:09:37.928
I must've.

01:09:38.011 --> 01:09:40.555
- D'you wish he was still here?
- No.

01:09:40.721 --> 01:09:44.059
- I hate love.
- Do you, Jo?

01:09:44.143 --> 01:09:46.185
Yes, I do.

01:09:55.571 --> 01:09:57.614
God, it's hot!

01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:13.130
Oh, Jo, stop prowling about.

01:10:13.547 --> 01:10:17.134
- I feel so restless.
- Well, sit down or something.

01:10:20.804 --> 01:10:25.350
Come on, baby,
let's see what big sister's making for us.

01:10:26.018 --> 01:10:30.522
Oh, Jo, put it down,
I’ve just done all that, get off!

01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:36.528
- I feel like throwing myself in the river!
- I wouldn't do that, it's full of rubbish.

01:10:36.612 --> 01:10:38.280
Here.

01:10:38.405 --> 01:10:40.199
Read this.

01:10:40.324 --> 01:10:43.911
When the baby comes,
you won't know one end of it from the other.

01:10:44.411 --> 01:10:47.247
\x22Looking after baby.\x22 In't that nice

01:10:47.331 --> 01:10:48.874
\x22Third month.\x22

01:10:48.957 --> 01:10:51.001
\x22Exercises, relaxation.\x22

01:10:51.126 --> 01:10:53.128
\x22Fourth month.\x22

01:10:53.212 --> 01:10:55.005
\x22Constipation.\x22

01:10:55.088 --> 01:10:57.174
Drink that and shut up.

01:10:57.216 --> 01:11:00.594
- I hate milk.
- Well, get it drunk.

01:11:09.812 --> 01:11:13.357
- Does it tell you how to feed babies?
- Even you know that.

01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:16.527
I know about that way, breast-feeding.

01:11:16.610 --> 01:11:20.531
I’m not having a little animal nibbling at me.
it’s cannibalistic.

01:11:20.614 --> 01:11:23.033
Stop trying to be inhuman,
it doesn't suit you.

01:11:23.158 --> 01:11:26.328
I mean it. I hate motherhood.

01:11:26.411 --> 01:11:30.749
Well, you've got it coming to you,
so you might as well make a good job of it.

01:11:30.874 --> 01:11:34.461
- I’ve got toothache.
- Yes, I’ve got bloody heartache.

01:11:35.254 --> 01:11:37.506
Got any of that toothache cure?

01:11:37.589 --> 01:11:41.885
There's only one cure for the toothache
and that's a visit to the dentist.

01:11:52.813 --> 01:11:54.857
Oh... Jo!

01:11:54.940 --> 01:11:57.693
- How much longer is this going on for?
- What?

01:11:57.776 --> 01:12:01.613
- Your present performance.
- You moved in on me, remember?

01:12:01.738 --> 01:12:03.740
If you don't like it, get out.

01:12:03.824 --> 01:12:07.119
But you wouldn't do that, Geoffrey.
Got no confidence in yourself, have you?

01:12:07.202 --> 01:12:09.371
Afraid the girls'll laugh.

01:12:11.331 --> 01:12:15.043
- You like babies, don't you, Geoff?
- They're all right.

01:12:15.127 --> 01:12:18.797
Would you like to be
the father of my baby, Geoff?

01:12:22.467 --> 01:12:24.511
Yes, I would.

01:12:26.430 --> 01:12:29.308
I... I’m... I feel stifled in here.

01:12:29.391 --> 01:12:32.394
- I’m going out.
- Well, I’II come with you.

01:12:35.063 --> 01:12:37.274
# All she wants is gold and silver

01:12:37.357 --> 01:12:40.736
# And a fine young man, you know

01:12:40.944 --> 01:12:44.490
# On a hill there lives a lady

01:12:44.615 --> 01:12:47.284
# Who she is I do not know...

01:12:47.367 --> 01:12:49.828
Can you smell that canal? it’s filthy!

01:12:50.996 --> 01:12:55.501
- And all those dirty children!
- They can't help getting dirty round here.

01:12:55.584 --> 01:12:57.794
Why d'you stay with me, Geoff?

01:12:57.878 --> 01:13:02.049
Somebody's got to look after you.
You can't look after yourself, that's obvious.

01:13:02.132 --> 01:13:05.260
# All she wants is gold and silver

01:13:05.344 --> 01:13:08.388
# And a fine young man, you know

01:13:08.472 --> 01:13:11.850
# On a hill there lives a lady

01:13:11.975 --> 01:13:15.187
# Who she is I do not know

01:13:15.229 --> 01:13:18.524
# All she wants is gold and silver

01:13:18.607 --> 01:13:21.860
# And a fine young man, you know

01:13:21.944 --> 01:13:24.029
Do you think there's gonna be a storm?

01:13:24.112 --> 01:13:26.240
I wouldn't be surprised.

01:13:26.323 --> 01:13:30.160
I don't think it's doing you any good
being with me all the time.

01:13:30.244 --> 01:13:32.371
I couldn't move away from you now.

01:13:32.454 --> 01:13:35.374
You must. We can't be together all the time.

01:13:35.499 --> 01:13:37.709
I’d rather be dead than away from you.

01:13:38.752 --> 01:13:40.796
You say that as if you mean it.

01:13:40.879 --> 01:13:42.923
Well, I do mean it.

01:13:43.006 --> 01:13:47.678
Before I knew you I didn't care much
whether I lived or died, y'know.

01:13:48.637 --> 01:13:52.975
But then I met you
and, well, being with you's me life.

01:13:54.643 --> 01:13:58.730
There's no need for us to split up, is there?

01:13:58.814 --> 01:14:01.066
Come on, rain, come on, storm!

01:14:03.485 --> 01:14:04.945
Jo?

01:14:12.911 --> 01:14:15.038
it kicked me, Geoff.

01:14:17.666 --> 01:14:19.751
it kicked me!

01:14:45.736 --> 01:14:49.573
- Can I help you, sir?
- Yes, I wanted some information, please.

01:14:49.698 --> 01:14:54.495
Well, me wife's going to have a baby
and I wondered if you'd got any leaflets.

01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:58.665
- To put me in the picture, like.
- I’m sure we can do something for you.

01:14:58.749 --> 01:15:02.794
- When does she expect the baby?
- Not yet. A couple of months.

01:15:02.836 --> 01:15:05.881
Well, perhaps she ought to
come down here herself.

01:15:05.964 --> 01:15:09.259
She's a little bit shy.
I expect she'll be along later.

01:15:09.343 --> 01:15:13.972
Very well. Just a moment, Mrs Walsh.
Will you wait here a second, please?

01:15:38.789 --> 01:15:41.750
I think she ought to have this.
She can practise on it.

01:15:41.834 --> 01:15:44.419
I suppose she's very young.

01:15:44.503 --> 01:15:48.799
Anyway, you can borrow this and let us
have it back when you've done with it.

01:15:48.841 --> 01:15:52.970
it comes in very handy if she's dubious
about handling the baby.

01:15:54.972 --> 01:15:58.058
There. All right?

01:16:34.470 --> 01:16:36.722
Look at that little boy over there.

01:16:36.763 --> 01:16:38.849
He's filthy.

01:16:38.932 --> 01:16:41.643
And his hair, it's walking away.

01:16:41.727 --> 01:16:43.770
She shouldn't be allowed.

01:16:43.854 --> 01:16:45.606
- Who?
- His mother.

01:16:45.689 --> 01:16:48.275
Think of the harm she does having children.

01:17:17.304 --> 01:17:18.972
Look at that.

01:17:19.056 --> 01:17:20.849
it’s dead.

01:17:20.933 --> 01:17:23.727
A bit of love, a bit of lust and there y'are.

01:17:23.811 --> 01:17:27.231
We don't ask for life,
we have it thrust upon us.

01:17:28.982 --> 01:17:31.026
- Hold me hand, Geoff.
- What?

01:17:31.109 --> 01:17:33.529
- Hold me hand!
- Jo!

01:17:40.369 --> 01:17:42.412
You've got nice hands.

01:17:43.413 --> 01:17:44.915
Hard.

01:17:45.415 --> 01:17:50.170
I used to try and hold me mother's hands
but she'd always pull 'em away from me.

01:17:51.088 --> 01:17:53.507
- I like you.
- Oh!

01:17:53.590 --> 01:17:58.262
- D'you like me more than you don't?
- Now you're being Irish.

01:17:58.345 --> 01:18:00.722
Well, a fine Irishwoman you are.

01:18:00.806 --> 01:18:03.892
Where did your ancestors fall,
battle of Salford Town Hall?

01:18:04.601 --> 01:18:06.937
Me mother's father was Irish.

01:18:07.062 --> 01:18:09.273
And she had me by an Irishman.

01:18:11.108 --> 01:18:13.443
The village idiot, from what I can make out.

01:18:15.070 --> 01:18:17.114
You what?

01:18:18.073 --> 01:18:20.993
A frolic in a hayloft one afternoon.

01:18:21.076 --> 01:18:23.162
She said he had eyes like me.

01:18:23.245 --> 01:18:26.248
- Are you making it up?
- No.

01:18:27.332 --> 01:18:29.877
He lived in the twilight land, my daddy.

01:18:30.002 --> 01:18:32.129
The land of the daft.

01:18:32.212 --> 01:18:34.631
- Did Helen tell you all this?
- Yes.

01:18:34.756 --> 01:18:38.677
Yes, I thought so.
She likes to make an effect, that one.

01:18:41.513 --> 01:18:45.267
Well, can you see Helen going out
with a real loony?

01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:48.228
Oh, thanks, Geoff, you're a cure.

01:18:48.687 --> 01:18:51.190
'Ey, I’ve got something for you.

01:18:51.273 --> 01:18:53.525
Well, I got it from the clinic, y'know.

01:18:53.609 --> 01:18:56.737
I thought you could practise
a few holds on it.

01:19:00.282 --> 01:19:02.951
- The colour's wrong.
- What?

01:19:03.035 --> 01:19:05.454
The colour's wrong!

01:19:06.330 --> 01:19:08.499
I’II bash its brains out, I’II kill it!

01:19:08.582 --> 01:19:10.751
I don't want this baby, Geoff!

01:19:10.834 --> 01:19:13.128
I don't want to be a mother!

01:19:13.212 --> 01:19:15.255
I don't want to be a woman!

01:19:27.935 --> 01:19:28.936
Jo?

01:19:45.577 --> 01:19:46.703
What d'you think I can do about it?

01:19:49.373 --> 01:19:52.251
In any case, bearing a child
doesn't put you under an obligation to it.

01:19:52.334 --> 01:19:55.087
Well, I would've thought it would've done.

01:19:55.212 --> 01:19:59.132
Well, you've got another think coming.
If she can't look after herself,

01:19:59.258 --> 01:20:01.218
it's her own lookout.

01:20:01.301 --> 01:20:04.763
And don't sit there
looking as if it's all my fault.

01:20:04.847 --> 01:20:06.974
Well, it's your grandchild.

01:20:07.057 --> 01:20:09.393
Oh, you put years on me, you do.

01:20:09.935 --> 01:20:13.564
She's more than I can cope with, that girl.
She always has been.

01:20:13.689 --> 01:20:15.816
Well, that's obvious.

01:20:15.899 --> 01:20:21.613
And what part have you got in this little
Victorian melodrama? Nursemaid?

01:20:23.115 --> 01:20:24.658
Helen!

01:20:24.741 --> 01:20:27.578
Helen! Have I got a clean shirt?

01:20:33.167 --> 01:20:35.711
All right, I’II come and see her.

01:20:35.794 --> 01:20:39.923
it’s not my fault. I’ve not known where
she's been living these last few months.

01:21:00.986 --> 01:21:04.448
- Now, don't keep me waiting, I want a drink.
- You've had enough.

01:21:04.531 --> 01:21:06.658
I’m not hanging about in this filthy hole.

01:21:06.742 --> 01:21:08.911
Wait where you like, then.

01:21:09.244 --> 01:21:11.246
If you're not back in ten minutes, I’m going.

01:21:11.330 --> 01:21:13.165
Oh, suit yourself.

01:21:15.417 --> 01:21:17.127
Jo?

01:21:17.211 --> 01:21:18.587
Jo!

01:21:20.547 --> 01:21:23.175
'Ey, you won't tell her
I came and saw you, will you?

01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:26.178
- Where is she, Romeo?
- She's in bed.

01:21:30.849 --> 01:21:33.268
And what sort of a dump is this?

01:21:34.394 --> 01:21:39.399
And what d'you think you're doing,
hiding yourself away in this chicken run?

01:21:43.111 --> 01:21:46.740
Lots of girls in your condition
have to work and take care of a family.

01:21:47.866 --> 01:21:50.285
Well, come on, let's have a look at you.

01:21:50.410 --> 01:21:52.663
You're looking a bit peaky.

01:21:52.830 --> 01:21:54.957
No wonder.

01:21:55.624 --> 01:21:59.670
Oh, stop sulking.
I’ve brought you some money.

01:21:59.753 --> 01:22:02.756
it’s taken you a long time
to come round to this, hasn't it?

01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:05.592
- What?
- The famous mother love act.

01:22:05.676 --> 01:22:09.805
Since I’ve known I’ve not been able
to sleep at nights thinking about you.

01:22:09.888 --> 01:22:12.975
There'll be money every week in the post
from now on.

01:22:13.058 --> 01:22:16.353
Until you forget!
You walked out the door with that man.

01:22:16.436 --> 01:22:18.564
You didn't give me a second thought.

01:22:18.647 --> 01:22:20.774
How did you get here, anyway?

01:22:22.484 --> 01:22:25.362
I’II get you for this, Geoffrey Ingham!

01:22:25.445 --> 01:22:28.991
What you trying to run,
a back-to-mother movement?

01:22:29.032 --> 01:22:32.536
- Are you working?
- She doesn't like people looking at her.

01:22:32.661 --> 01:22:36.290
She'd be better off working
than living off you like a little bloodsucker.

01:22:36.373 --> 01:22:39.126
- She doesn't live off me!
- No, we share everything.

01:22:39.209 --> 01:22:42.171
- We're communists, too!
- That's his influence, I suppose.

01:22:42.254 --> 01:22:44.923
You go back to your fancy man!

01:22:45.007 --> 01:22:49.595
Ooh, I’II give you such a bloody good hiding!
That's what you've gone short of.

01:22:49.636 --> 01:22:52.639
- Don't show yourself up for what y'are!
- You couldn't wait, could you?

01:22:52.723 --> 01:22:54.892
Now look at the mess
you've got yourself in.

01:22:54.975 --> 01:22:58.020
- I’II get out of it without your help.
- Threw yourself at the first man you met.

01:22:58.145 --> 01:22:59.438
Yes, I did.

01:22:59.521 --> 01:23:01.273
- You're man mad.
- Like you.

01:23:01.356 --> 01:23:04.234
Know what they're calling you round here?
A silly little whore.

01:23:04.276 --> 01:23:06.236
They know where I got it from, don't they?

01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:08.655
Ooh, I’II knock your bloody head off!

01:23:08.739 --> 01:23:11.950
- Let me get at her!
- Go ahead, go on!

01:23:12.034 --> 01:23:14.536
Stop shouting at each other, will you!

01:23:14.661 --> 01:23:16.747
Oh, shut up, we enjoy it.

01:23:16.830 --> 01:23:20.292
- And another thing...
- Hey, hey, what the hell's going on?

01:23:20.375 --> 01:23:23.378
D'you expect me to wait all day
in that filthy street?

01:23:23.462 --> 01:23:25.172
I told you to wait outside.

01:23:25.255 --> 01:23:27.758
Don't you wag your bloody finger at me.

01:23:29.384 --> 01:23:31.929
Oh, hello, then, the erring daughter.

01:23:32.054 --> 01:23:36.141
Well, Josephine,
you're a big girl now, aren't you?

01:23:36.225 --> 01:23:38.393
Who's this, the father?

01:23:38.519 --> 01:23:40.771
Oh dear, no.

01:23:40.896 --> 01:23:43.232
Who's got a bun in the oven, then, eh?

01:23:43.315 --> 01:23:46.944
Who's got a cake in the stove?

01:23:48.987 --> 01:23:52.282
I’m sorry. He's had one too many.

01:23:57.329 --> 01:23:59.915
Who's coming out for a little drink, eh?

01:24:05.128 --> 01:24:07.506
What's the matter with everybody?

01:24:13.762 --> 01:24:16.682
Doesn't anybody want to come out
for a little drink?

01:24:16.723 --> 01:24:19.059
- You get out of here!
- Ah-ah-ah!

01:24:19.143 --> 01:24:21.186
You be quiet.

01:24:21.311 --> 01:24:23.522
That's right, Mary Ann,
you come and have a little drink with me.

01:24:27.901 --> 01:24:30.237
Who's been giving my money away again?

01:24:30.362 --> 01:24:31.822
Take your money.

01:24:34.283 --> 01:24:36.493
Which is the way to the littlest room?

01:24:37.578 --> 01:24:39.496
Oh, get him out of here, Romeo.

01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:42.082
That's right, Pollyanna, you lead the way.

01:24:44.084 --> 01:24:47.045
Ooh! it’s all right, love,
I know the district.

01:25:05.939 --> 01:25:07.024
Like a cigarette?

01:25:07.733 --> 01:25:08.901
No.

01:25:09.026 --> 01:25:12.529
Yes, I will. I’II keep it for later.

01:25:24.750 --> 01:25:27.628
Jo, why don't you come and live with me?

01:25:27.711 --> 01:25:30.923
- There's a nice room and plenty of food.
- No, thanks.

01:25:31.131 --> 01:25:35.052
Peter's all right
except when he's had one too many.

01:25:35.969 --> 01:25:39.640
Jo, look, I’m offering you a decent home.

01:25:39.723 --> 01:25:42.726
I’II take care of you, I’II see you through.

01:25:42.810 --> 01:25:45.145
We're not having that little slut
at our place!

01:25:45.270 --> 01:25:46.772
The house is half mine.

01:25:46.855 --> 01:25:49.149
Aye, like hell it is.

01:25:49.233 --> 01:25:52.069
- Oh, take no notice of him.
- Now, will you come on?

01:25:52.152 --> 01:25:53.237
I want this drink!

01:25:53.403 --> 01:25:55.489
Get him out of here,
we'll get our notice!

01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:05.541
Would you like me
to come and stay here with you?

01:26:05.624 --> 01:26:07.668
No, thanks.

01:26:09.461 --> 01:26:11.755
Well, I’II send you some money.

01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:14.174
And hang on to it, you might need it.

01:26:38.907 --> 01:26:41.201
We're not having that mademoiselle
from Armentiéres living with us!

01:26:41.326 --> 01:26:43.745
Now, I dragged you
out of the gutter once.

01:26:43.829 --> 01:26:47.749
If you want to go back it's all the same
to me. it’s your own bloody level.

01:26:47.833 --> 01:26:50.627
And don't you worry
about your wandering boy.

01:26:50.711 --> 01:26:53.547
There's plenty of other fish in the ocean.

01:26:53.630 --> 01:26:55.215
I’m getting out.

01:27:30.667 --> 01:27:33.712
- In't he smashing?
- Yes, marvellous, in't he?

01:27:33.795 --> 01:27:37.341
- Where's Jo?
- I saw her going down by the river.

01:27:52.689 --> 01:27:56.026
Hello. Thinking of chucking yourself in?

01:27:56.109 --> 01:27:58.695
No. I like it here.

01:27:58.779 --> 01:28:02.074
- I’ve seen five water rats.
- Charming!

01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:06.411
- D'you still love him?
- No.

01:28:06.495 --> 01:28:08.580
it’s only a dream I had.

01:28:08.622 --> 01:28:12.334
- Aye, your black prince.
- What was his name?

01:28:12.417 --> 01:28:16.421
- Prince Ossini.
- No. it was Jimmie.

01:28:16.463 --> 01:28:20.175
Oh, well, the dream's gone.
But the baby's real enough.

01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:23.011
Me mother always used to say

01:28:23.095 --> 01:28:25.514
you remember the first time
all your life.

01:28:27.015 --> 01:28:31.687
- Until now I’d forgotten all about it.
- Remember when I asked you to marry me?

01:28:31.770 --> 01:28:33.063
Yes.

01:28:33.105 --> 01:28:35.941
it’s not marrying love between us,
thank God.

01:28:36.024 --> 01:28:38.861
You need someone to love you
while you look for someone to love.

01:28:42.281 --> 01:28:44.366
Have you been unhappy with me?

01:28:44.449 --> 01:28:46.535
Who's happy?

01:28:48.787 --> 01:28:51.165
As I was going up Pippin Hill

01:28:51.290 --> 01:28:52.916
Pippin Hill was dirty

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.836
And then I met a pretty miss
And she dropped me a curtsy

01:28:55.919 --> 01:28:59.047
Little miss, pretty miss
Blessings light upon you

01:28:59.131 --> 01:29:02.676
If I had half-a-crown a day
I’d gladly spend it on you.

01:29:02.759 --> 01:29:05.762
- Would you, Geoff?
- I would.

01:29:07.848 --> 01:29:10.058
I’d hold your baby in me arms

01:29:10.142 --> 01:29:12.561
I’d comfort you and keep you

01:29:12.644 --> 01:29:15.314
We'd climb the hill
when the moon was up

01:29:15.397 --> 01:29:17.483
And we'd sit there till it set

01:29:17.566 --> 01:29:21.987
I’d hold you tight till the world was done
And a daisy grew in my hat!

01:29:22.070 --> 01:29:24.948
- That doesn't rhyme!
- I know, but it's true.

01:29:25.032 --> 01:29:27.201
You're a funny man, Geoff.

01:29:27.868 --> 01:29:29.912
I mean that.

01:29:29.995 --> 01:29:31.580
You're unique.

01:29:32.331 --> 01:29:37.294
I always want to have you with me cos
I know you'll never ask anything from me.

01:29:37.544 --> 01:29:39.713
- Where you going?
- Home.

01:29:39.797 --> 01:29:42.132
I’m cooking something for tea.

01:30:01.610 --> 01:30:03.946
'Ey, look at that, in't it marvellous?

01:30:04.780 --> 01:30:06.615
'Ere, what you gonna call it?

01:30:06.698 --> 01:30:10.285
- What, the cake?
- Oh, no, the baby, you daft thing!

01:30:11.119 --> 01:30:13.622
I think I’II call it Number One.

01:30:13.747 --> 01:30:17.584
- it’II always be number one to itself.
- You're right.

01:30:19.419 --> 01:30:21.672
Anybody at home?

01:30:21.755 --> 01:30:25.467
Well, I’m back.

01:30:29.972 --> 01:30:33.433
Well, the old place looks
more cheerful now, doesn't it?

01:30:35.727 --> 01:30:38.689
Well, I arrived just in time
by the look of things, didn't I?

01:30:38.772 --> 01:30:42.109
- D'you want a cup of tea?
- Hm, you're still here, are you?

01:30:42.192 --> 01:30:44.361
There won't be much room
for two of us around, you know.

01:30:44.486 --> 01:30:48.574
- Don't you start on Geoffrey!
- That's all right, Jo, I don't mind moving out.

01:30:48.657 --> 01:30:52.327
For heaven's sake, you don't have to
wilt away as soon as she barges in.

01:30:52.452 --> 01:30:54.997
All right, I will have
a cup of tea with you.

01:30:55.122 --> 01:30:58.750
Jo, I got you some lovely things
for the baby.

01:30:58.876 --> 01:31:00.878
Have you got everything packed?

01:31:01.712 --> 01:31:03.964
- Packed?
- Yeah.

01:31:04.047 --> 01:31:06.091
But I’m not going into hospital.

01:31:06.175 --> 01:31:10.012
- You're not having the baby here, are you?
- She didn't want to go away.

01:31:10.095 --> 01:31:13.432
She can't have a baby in a dump like this.

01:31:13.515 --> 01:31:17.769
- The first one can be a bit tricky.
- She's been having regular checkups.

01:31:17.853 --> 01:31:20.189
Don't start frightening her.

01:31:20.272 --> 01:31:25.027
And what do you know about it?
We're not playing at doctors now, you know.

01:31:26.695 --> 01:31:31.241
I forgot to pay the taxi. Where's me bags?
I won't be a minute.

01:31:35.037 --> 01:31:37.331
Well, she's back, Jo.

01:31:41.084 --> 01:31:43.295
'Ey, would you like a bit of cake?

01:31:43.378 --> 01:31:45.422
No, thanks.

01:31:46.673 --> 01:31:48.842
You're glad she's back really.

01:31:48.926 --> 01:31:50.969
No, I’m not.

01:31:51.053 --> 01:31:53.555
You needn't be afraid
of hurting me feelings.

01:31:54.431 --> 01:31:57.392
God, what am I supposed to say,
Geoffrey?

01:31:57.476 --> 01:31:59.645
it’s you I need, not her.

01:31:59.728 --> 01:32:02.231
it’s only a choice
between two old women.

01:32:02.356 --> 01:32:04.191
Oh, thanks

01:32:04.274 --> 01:32:06.401
And of the two I’d rather have you.

01:32:06.443 --> 01:32:09.196
Well, you'll need a woman with you too.

01:32:09.279 --> 01:32:13.492
- Someone who's been through it all before.
- Oh, stop romancing!

01:32:13.575 --> 01:32:16.620
I asked you to stay here.
Why can't you leave me alone?

01:32:16.703 --> 01:32:18.747
Now, don't you start upsetting her!

01:32:18.872 --> 01:32:24.044
I haven't! it’s you, charging in here,
trampling on everyone's feelings!

01:32:24.169 --> 01:32:26.964
I’d have a hard job
to trample on yours, son!

01:32:27.005 --> 01:32:29.049
Don't you \x22son\x22 me!

01:32:29.133 --> 01:32:31.927
My God, what a travesty of a mother
you've turned out to be!

01:32:32.010 --> 01:32:33.345
Come here to help her, have you?

01:32:33.428 --> 01:32:36.306
- All you do is put the fear of death in her!
- Have you gone mad?

01:32:36.390 --> 01:32:39.017
Oh, leave me alone, both of you!

01:32:39.101 --> 01:32:42.855
I can't stand it any more!
I just can't stand it!

01:32:43.397 --> 01:32:46.316
Excuse me.
I want a word with my daughter.

01:32:48.819 --> 01:32:50.946
What's the matter, Jo?

01:32:52.030 --> 01:32:54.199
Geoffrey's right about you.

01:32:54.283 --> 01:32:56.368
I wanted you to come back.

01:32:57.286 --> 01:32:59.788
But when you did
it all went wrong again.

01:32:59.913 --> 01:33:02.457
Why did you want me
to come back, love?

01:33:05.085 --> 01:33:08.589
- I wanted to know what it's like.
- What?

01:33:09.965 --> 01:33:11.967
is there much pain?

01:33:12.050 --> 01:33:15.220
it’s not so much pain as hard work.

01:33:15.304 --> 01:33:18.265
But don't worry, love.
You've got me now.

01:33:19.516 --> 01:33:22.311
I can do without you. I can manage.

01:33:22.394 --> 01:33:24.938
Well, you're very clever, aren't you

01:33:25.063 --> 01:33:28.984
There's no need for you to be so superior.
He's thrown you out, hasn't he?

01:33:29.067 --> 01:33:31.320
And you had to come
crawling back here.

01:33:31.403 --> 01:33:33.489
Well, it was good while it lasted.

01:33:35.407 --> 01:33:38.202
- D'you know what I think?
- What?

01:33:38.285 --> 01:33:40.454
I think you're still in love with him.

01:33:40.537 --> 01:33:43.582
Me, in love? Don't be so daft.

01:33:43.665 --> 01:33:45.792
What happened?

01:33:47.169 --> 01:33:49.671
He's just gone off
with his bit of crumpet.

01:33:49.755 --> 01:33:51.507
So we're back where we started.

01:33:53.258 --> 01:33:55.302
Jo, I forgot to tell you.

01:33:55.385 --> 01:33:57.805
I’ve ordered a beautiful cot.

01:33:57.930 --> 01:34:00.766
it’s got lambs and poodles all over it.

01:34:01.058 --> 01:34:03.310
We've got one.

01:34:04.353 --> 01:34:06.480
Geoff got it.

01:34:06.855 --> 01:34:09.066
Bit old-fashioned, in't it?

01:34:09.191 --> 01:34:11.235
We like it.

01:34:11.318 --> 01:34:14.363
Now, come on,
lie back, love, come on.

01:34:14.446 --> 01:34:17.658
- You'll be giving yourself a headache.
- Do you wonder?

01:34:17.741 --> 01:34:19.827
Now, come on, have a bit of a rest

01:34:19.910 --> 01:34:21.995
and I’II just go and tidy up.

01:34:22.079 --> 01:34:24.206
- Helen?
- What?

01:34:24.289 --> 01:34:26.416
I want Geoffrey to stay.

01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:28.585
Understand?

01:34:28.669 --> 01:34:30.295
Mm.

01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:38.572
I’m writing her a note.

01:35:50.375 --> 01:35:53.253
While you're at it,
take this thing with you.

01:36:21.740 --> 01:36:23.367
What's the matter, Jo?

01:36:23.450 --> 01:36:25.661
I must have been dreaming.

01:36:27.162 --> 01:36:29.498
Don't worry, love.

01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:32.709
Where's Geoff?

01:36:32.793 --> 01:36:35.629
I’m just going to make you
a nice fresh cup of tea, dear.

01:36:38.549 --> 01:36:40.759
Where's Geoffrey?

01:36:40.843 --> 01:36:42.886
He's just gone out, love.

01:36:46.890 --> 01:36:49.101
- Helen?
- Yes, love?

01:36:52.146 --> 01:36:54.231
My baby may be black.

01:36:54.314 --> 01:36:56.400
You what, love?

01:36:56.483 --> 01:36:59.027
My baby may be black.

01:36:59.278 --> 01:37:02.573
Oh, shut up!
You'll be giving yourself nightmares.

01:37:02.698 --> 01:37:04.741
it’s true.

01:37:08.245 --> 01:37:11.248
You don't mean that sailor
was a black man?

01:37:11.331 --> 01:37:12.916
Yeah.

01:37:16.170 --> 01:37:18.255
Oh, my God, I need a drink!

01:37:18.797 --> 01:37:21.925
Well, what you gonna do about it?

01:37:24.011 --> 01:37:26.722
Guy, guy, guy!
Prick him in the eye!

01:37:26.805 --> 01:37:29.308
Tie him to the lamppost
and leave him there to die!

01:37:29.349 --> 01:37:31.894
'Ey, in't it marvellous?

01:37:32.478 --> 01:37:35.522
Tie him to the lamppost
and leave him there to die!

01:37:35.647 --> 01:37:38.609
Guy, guy, guy!
Prick him in the eye!

01:37:38.692 --> 01:37:41.069
Tie him to the lamppost
and leave him there to die!

01:37:41.153 --> 01:37:43.363
Guy, guy, guy!
Prick him in the eye!

01:37:43.489 --> 01:37:46.700
Tie him to the lamppost
and leave him there to die!

01:38:24.404 --> 01:38:26.114
Geoffrey!

01:38:51.682 --> 01:38:53.851
You clown, Geoff!

01:38:56.812 --> 01:38:58.856
You clown!

01:39:50.991 --> 01:39:53.035
I’II make you a cup of tea, love.

01:40:05.798 --> 01:40:09.092
# Oh, the big ship sails
on the alley-alley-o

01:40:09.176 --> 01:40:12.346
# The alley-alley-o, the alley-alley-o

01:40:12.429 --> 01:40:15.557

01:40:15.641 --> 01:40:19.186
