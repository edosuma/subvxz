in this stuff.

20:17.422 --> 20:19.547
- Well, the first card is
always the present.

20:19.547 --> 20:22.422
It could mean starting over,
a rebirth.

20:22.422 --> 20:24.838
- Okay, so... not that bad.
- It could also mean death.

20:24.838 --> 20:26.797
- What? This is some Long
Island Medium bullshit.

20:26.797 --> 20:28.380
You know my Dad just died.

20:28.380 --> 20:31.130
- You're directing the energy
of the deck, Kate, not me.

20:31.130 --> 20:32.338
(Kate grumbles)

20:32.338 --> 20:34.505
- Do you want me to keep going?
- I mean...

20:39.547 --> 20:40.838
I don't like that.

20:40.838 --> 20:42.630
- You need to consider your
work-life balance.

20:42.630 --> 20:44.588
You might be neglecting
yourself,

20:44.588 --> 20:46.380
your home, loved ones?

20:47.922 --> 20:50.172
- Yeah? You talk to Anne
tonight?

20:50.172 --> 20:51.713
- I'm just telling you
what I see.

20:51.713 --> 20:53.630
- Okay, I don't have all night
to do this.

20:53.630 --> 20:55.630
Okay, now we're talkin'.
That guy's kinda cute.

20:55.630 --> 20:57.963
He's got a happy vibe goin' on.
What's that mean?

20:57.963 --> 20:59.838
(Thunder cracks)

20:59.838 --> 21:02.005
- A betrayal.

21:02.005 --> 21:03.338
(Thunder cracks)

21:03.338 --> 21:05.047
The end of everything
as you know it.
