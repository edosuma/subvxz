03:20.020 --> 03:21.294
JUST TELL MOM I STOPPED BY.

AND IF IT'S A SIMPLE LEAK,
HE CAN FIX IT, OKAY?

03:23.160 --> 03:24.536
BUT IF IT'S A SERIOUS
PLUMBING ISSUE,

03:24.580 --> 03:25.911
DON'T LET HIM ANWVHERE NEAR IT.

I'M ALWAYS THINKING
ABOUT THE COMPANY, YOU KNOW?

06:58.030 --> 06:59.850
I AM ALWAYS THINKING.

06:59.900 --> 07:02.926

07:04.970 --> 07:07.177
- WELL, YOU KNOW, THIS MORNING
WHEN I WAS DRIVING TO WORK,

07:07.210 --> 07:08.450
I HAD THIS IDEA, OKAY?

07:08.490 --> 07:10.833
NOW, IT MIGHT BE A TERRIBLE
IDEA, BUT I WAS THINKING ABOUT--

07:10.870 --> 07:13.521
YOU KNOW HOW KIDS
ARE ALWAYS LOSING THEIR SHOES?

07:13.570 --> 07:16.630
WELL, THEY ARE.
IT'S A--IT'S A UNIVERSAL THING.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.843
UH, I WAS THINKING ABOUT...

07:18.880 --> 07:22.429
A KIDS SHOE WITH A CLICKER.

07:22.470 --> 07:25.712
KID LOSES HIS SHOE.
YOU PUSH THE CLICKER.

07:25.750 --> 07:26.910
IT BEEPS.
YOU FIND IT--

07:26.960 --> 07:28.882
WHETHER IT'S, YOU KNOW,
UNDER THE BED,

07:28.930 --> 07:31.137
IT'S IN THE CLOSET,
IN THE GARAGE.

07:31.170 --> 07:34.059
CLICK, BZZZ, BAM . ..

07:34.100 --> 07:35.135
SHOE.

07:35.170 --> 07:37.445
- YOU THOUGHT OF THIS?

07:40.320 --> 07:41.309
- YES.

07:41.350 --> 07:42.590
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

07:42.630 --> 07:44.029
THAT'S GREAT. I LOVE IT.
IT'S BRILL.

07:44.080 --> 07:45.479
WE GOT TO MOVE.

07:45.530 --> 07:47.282
- ALL RIGHT, SO YOU WANT ME
TO GET ON THIS?

07:47.320 --> 07:48.639
- YES. RIGHT AWAY.
ARE YOU KIDDING?

07:48.670 --> 07:49.637
- ALL RIGHT, I'M ON IT.

09:13.790 --> 09:15.371
YOU HAVE TO MAKE
EVERY DECISION.

09:15.410 --> 09:16.752

TO MAKE HIM THINK

09:16.790 --> 09:18.269

11:02.070 --> 11:03.230
YOU INVITE 'EM
INTO YOUR HOUSE

11:03.280 --> 11:06.898
TO DO ALL THIS CRAP WORK,
AND THEN YOU END UP PAYING.

11:06.940 --> 11:09.966
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

11:10.010 --> 11:12.217

11:48.630 --> 11:50.211

I CONVERTED IT FROM A GARAGE
INTO A GUESTHOUSE.

11:52.400 --> 11:57.019

THIS IS SOMETHING YOUR MOTHER--
SHE'S GONNA FEEL LIKE--

12:24.950 --> 12:27.157
YOU KNOW, SHE'S GONNA
TAKE IT PERSONALLY.

- DAD, DO YOU GUYS HAVE, LIKE,

13:03.290 --> 13:06.430
SOME STUPID AGREEMENT
ABOUT NOT ACKNOWLEDGING

13:06.470 --> 13:07.562
EACH OTHER'S FLAWS?

13:07.610 --> 13:09.464
- YEAH.
IT'S CALLED MARRIAGE.

13:09.510 --> 13:11.956

13:24.450 --> 13:25.929
'CAUSE SHE WAS JUST GONNA LEAVE

A FAMILY CRISIS,

13:27.730 --> 13:29.618
BUT WE HAVE TEN A DAY, SO...
- HADDIE--

13:29.670 --> 13:31.456
SHE'S BEING HYPERBOLIC.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

13:31.500 --> 13:34.355

ANOTHER FAMILY CRISIS.

13:34.390 --> 13:35.664
UM, I'LL BE
IN MY OFFICE, OKAY?

13:35.710 --> 13:37.041

THIS WAY.

TO BE IMPRESSED

14:53.650 --> 14:56.778
BY MY 12 YEARS OF WAITRESSING
AT NICK'S PUB.

14:56.820 --> 14:57.741

14:57.790 --> 14:59.508
YOU'RE GONNA FIND SOMETHING
EVENTUALLY,

14:59.550 --> 15:01.859
AND YOU'RE JUST GONNA FORGET
ABOUT THIS...

15:01.900 --> 15:03.162
PERIOD.

15:03.210 --> 15:05.610

FOR 38 YEARS?

15:05.660 --> 15:07.799
I HOPE SO.

15:07.830 --> 15:10.207
- HEY, YOU KNOW,
THAT IDEA YOU HAD

15:10.250 --> 15:12.138
ABOUT THE SHOE-CLICKER THING?

15:12.180 --> 15:14.114
- YOU SOLD IT?
WE MADE A MILLION DOLLARS?

15:14.150 --> 15:15.549
- NO, NOT--NOT EXACTLY.

15:15.600 --> 15:17.113
BUT I DID BRING THE IDEA UP
TO MY BOSS.

15:17.150 --> 15:18.947
- AND HE FIRED YOU?
- MM-MM.

15:18.980 --> 15:21.392
NO, HE LIKED IT, ACTUALLY.

15:21.430 --> 15:23.364
- NO.

WE'RE GONNA MAYBE DEVELOP
THE IDEA.

15:28.090 --> 15:31.127
- NO, NOT REALLY.
- YEAH.

15:31.170 --> 15:32.501
LOOK, WE DEVELOP
A LOT OF IDEAS,

15:32.550 --> 15:34.541
AND A LOT OF THEM END UP
GOING NOWHERE, BUT--

15:34.580 --> 15:37.583
- NO, NO, I KNOW,
BUT THAT'S AMAZING.

15:37.620 --> 15:39.542

- SHE SAID THAT YOU GUYS
STILL HAVEN'T MADE IT

16:14.040 --> 16:17.794
OUT OF THE PARKING LOT?
- WHAT'S THAT?

16:17.830 --> 16:19.036
HONEY,
YOU'RE CUTTING THAT WRONG.

16:19.080 --> 16:20.274
THE SKIN HAS TO BE
COMPLETELY OFF OF THAT--

16:20.320 --> 16:21.309
- I'M DOING IT FANCY,
LIKE THIS.

16:21.350 --> 16:23.147
- YOU HAVE TO TAKE ALL
OF THE "STRIPEYS" OFF.

16:23.180 --> 16:24.215
- WHY?
- MAX WON'T EAT IT.

16:24.250 --> 16:25.387
- HE'LL EAT IT.
- NO, HE WON'T.

16:25.430 --> 16:26.454
- LISTEN, HONEY,
ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT

16:26.500 --> 16:28.081
WHEN I LEARNED HOW TO DRIVE,
MY DAD TOOK ME OUT

16:28.120 --> 16:29.496
ON THE ROAD
THE VERY FIRST DAY.

16:29.540 --> 16:31.189
- RIGHT, ZEEK JUST THREW YOU
TO THE WOLVES.

16:31.230 --> 16:32.674
THAT'S A BIG SHOCKER.
- ABSOLUTELY.

16:32.710 --> 16:34.291
FIRST DAY, WASN'T A PROBLEM.

16:34.330 --> 16:36.059
I HAVEN'T HAD A SINGLE
MOVING VIOLATION IN MY LIFE.

16:36.090 --> 16:38.365
- REALLY? ARE YOU CRITICIZING
MY DRIVING RECORD?

16:38.410 --> 16:40.332
BECAUSE I'M PRETTY GOOD.
- I'M JUST SAYING

16:40.370 --> 16:41.712
THAT WE SHOULD TRY TO GET HADDIE
OUT ON THE ROAD.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.957
- ABSOLUTELY.
I WILL TAKE HER OUT ON THE ROAD

16:44.000 --> 16:45.308
WHEN SHE'S READY.

16:45.340 --> 16:47.444
- [sighs] LISTEN, HONEY,
I KNOW THAT THIS IS HARD.

16:47.480 --> 16:49.129
OUR 16-YEAR OLD DAUGHTER
IS LEARNING HOW TO DRIVE.

16:49.180 --> 16:50.556
IT'S NOT THE EASIEST THING
IN THE WORLD TO ACCEPT.

16:50.590 --> 16:52.410
- THIS IS NOT ABOUT ME
RIGHT NOW--IT'S ABOUT HER.

16:52.450 --> 16:54.179
I WILL TAKE HER OUT
WHEN SHE'S READY.

16:54.220 --> 16:56.450
SHE'S NOT READY.
TRUST ME.

16:56.490 --> 16:57.764
- OKAY.

16:57.800 --> 17:00.212
- YOU NEED TO--
LOOK...

17:00.260 --> 17:03.661
- HE'S GONNA EAT 'EM LIKE THAT.
- NO, HE'S NOT.

17:03.710 --> 17:05.018
- SO IT STARTS OUT AS AN EGG.

17:05.050 --> 17:06.915
AND ONCE THE EGG
GETS FERTILIZED,

17:06.950 --> 17:08.508
IT DEVELOPS INTO A BABY.

17:08.540 --> 17:10.770
IT'S ONE
OF LIFE'S GREATEST MIRACLES.

17:10.820 --> 17:12.981
- THAT MAKE, UH--
MAKE SENSE?

17:13.030 --> 17:15.749
- WAIT, SO HOW DOES THE EGG
GET FERTILIZED?

17:15.790 --> 17:16.609
- IT HAPPENS.

17:16.650 --> 17:18.618
- IT JUST MAGICALLY HAPPENS?
- YEAH.

17:18.650 --> 17:21.585
- SYDNEY, THE DAD--

17:21.620 --> 17:24.555
THE DAD FERTILIZES IT.

17:24.590 --> 17:26.729
- THE DAD?

17:26.760 --> 17:27.829
- YEAH, IT'S THE DAD'S JOB.

17:27.870 --> 17:29.758
- DADDY, YOU BROUGHT
THE FERTILIZER?

17:29.800 --> 17:31.176
- YEP.

17:31.220 --> 17:34.041
- WELL, HOW'D YOU GET
THE FERTILIZER INTO THE EGG?

17:34.080 --> 17:36.492
- I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE
ICE CREAM TODAY.

17:36.530 --> 17:39.351
- I WANT TO KNOW HOW YOU DID IT!

17:39.400 --> 17:42.460
- WELL...

17:42.500 --> 17:46.539
THE DAD HAS WHAT'S CALLED...
- JULIA...

17:46.580 --> 17:49.048
- THE DAD HAS
WHAT'S CALLED A PENIS.

17:49.100 --> 17:50.260
AND...

17:50.310 --> 17:54.064
HE USES THE PENIS
TO FERTILIZE THE EGG.

17:54.100 --> 17:57.376
AND THE FERTILIZER
IS CALLED SPERM.

17:57.420 --> 18:00.628
AND, UH...
- WHERE DOES IT HAPPEN?

18:00.660 --> 18:05.450
DOES THE EGG COME OUT,
OR DOES THE SPERM GO IN?

18:07.670 --> 18:08.568
- [chuckles awkwardly]

18:08.600 --> 18:10.909
- I'M GONNA HAVE
A MINT CHOCOLATE CHIP.

18:10.950 --> 18:12.394
DAD'S GONNA HAVE A SUNDAE.

18:12.430 --> 18:13.738
- THAT SOUNDS GREAT.
- YEP.

18:13.780 --> 18:15.634
- IT'S A MILLION-DOLLAR IDEA.

18:15.680 --> 18:18.399
- NO, IT ISN'T.
IT'S NOT EVEN AN ID--WHOLE IDEA.

18:18.440 --> 18:19.532
IT JUST WAS OFF THE TOP
OF MY HEAD.

18:19.580 --> 18:22.299
- THAT'S A GAME CHANGER, SARAH.
THAT'S WHAT THAT IS.

18:22.340 --> 18:23.819
- DAD, REALLY?
NO.

18:23.860 --> 18:25.748
DAD, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THEY'RE NOT EVEN GONNA USE IT

18:25.790 --> 18:26.882
OR DO ANYTHING WITH IT.

18:26.930 --> 18:29.990
- DON'T THINK LIKE THAT!
SWEETHEART, YOU HAVE A GIFT.

18:30.030 --> 18:32.590
- [scoffs]
I DON'T HAVE A GIFI'.

18:32.620 --> 18:34.508
I HAVE A KID
WHO CAN'T FIND HIS SHOES.

18:34.560 --> 18:36.551
EXCUSE ME.
- OH, HONEY, LISTEN...

18:36.590 --> 18:39.479
SWEETHEART, I LOVE YOU,
BUT YOU GOT TO QUIT DOING THAT.

18:39.530 --> 18:40.519
- DOING WHAT?

18:40.560 --> 18:42.551
- WELL, BELITTLING YOURSELF,
SWEETHEART.

18:42.600 --> 18:44.693
IT'S--IT'S
A DEFENSE MECHANISM.

18:44.740 --> 18:45.638
- ZEEK, COME ON.

18:45.670 --> 18:48.252
SHE HASN'T EVEN HAD
HER COFFEE YET.

18:48.290 --> 18:49.700
- ALL I'M TRYING TO DO
IS JUST TELL HER

18:49.740 --> 18:52.629
SHE SHOULD VALUE
HER IDEAS, CAMILLE.

18:52.680 --> 18:53.886
- YES, I CAN HEAR THAT.

18:53.920 --> 18:56.059
AND I'M TRYING TO SAY THAT
YOU SHOULD LET SARAH AND ADAM

18:56.100 --> 18:57.408
MANAGE THEIR OWN LIVES.

18:57.440 --> 18:59.328
- BUT ALL I'M TRYING TO DO
IS JUST INSTILL

18:59.370 --> 19:02.578
A LITTLE BIT OF CONFIDENCE--

19:05.790 --> 19:08.930
I HEAR YOU.

19:08.970 --> 19:11.768
AND I SEE YOU, SWEETHEART.

19:11.800 --> 19:13.597
- I'LL BE IN MY STUDIO.

19:15.870 --> 19:18.111
- DAD?

19:18.150 --> 19:20.391
- HMM?
- ARE YOU MY DAD?

19:20.430 --> 19:22.739
- YEAH.
- IS THAT MARRIAGE COUNSELING?

19:22.780 --> 19:23.735
- YEAH.
- WOW!

19:23.780 --> 19:24.917
- 150 BUCKS AN HOUR.

19:24.950 --> 19:27.396
I DON'T UNDERSTAND A DAMN WORD
THE GUY IS SAYING.

19:27.440 --> 19:28.748
ALL RIGHT?
- IS THAT WHY YOU CUT THE HAIR?

19:28.780 --> 19:31.362
- THAT'S WHY I CUT MY HAIR.
- VERY IMPRESSIVE, DAD.

19:31.410 --> 19:32.889
GOOD JOB.
- I WANTED TO LOOK SOl-TER.

19:32.930 --> 19:35.091
DO I LOOK SOl-TER,
A LITTLE?

19:35.130 --> 19:36.097
- YES?

19:36.140 --> 19:38.756
- OKAY, HONEY,
IF YOU GIVE YOURSELF CREDIT,

19:38.790 --> 19:41.657
THEN OTHER PEOPLE WILL START
GIVING YOU CREDIT TOO.

19:41.690 --> 19:42.509
ALL RIGHT?
- OKAY.

19:42.560 --> 19:43.629
AND THE POINT IS
I THINK YOU COULD BE

19:43.660 --> 19:45.719
A PART OF THE PROCESS
OF THIS WHOLE SHOE THING.

19:45.770 --> 19:47.624
- THERE IS NO PROCESS.
IT'S ADAM'S JOB.

19:47.660 --> 19:49.480
AND IF HE WANTED MY HELP,
HE COULD ASK ME--

19:49.530 --> 19:51.179
- HOW THE HELL IS HE GONNA KNOW
IF YOU DON'T TELL HIM?

19:51.220 --> 19:52.699
YOU GOT TO TELL HIM
YOU WANT TO BE INVOLVED.

19:52.740 --> 19:54.492
- [stammering]
I DON'T KNOW, DAD.

19:54.530 --> 19:56.111
I DON'T THINK
HE WOULD LOVE IT, ANYWAY.

19:56.160 --> 19:57.878
AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR ADVICE,

19:57.920 --> 19:59.421
BUT I DON'T REALLY NEED IT.

19:59.470 --> 20:01.324
I'M A GROWN-UP,
AND I WILL TAKE CARE OF IT.

20:01.370 --> 20:03.053
AND JUST--I'M SORRY
I EVEN BROUGHT IT UP.

20:03.090 --> 20:06.400
- AW, HEY--SWEETHEART,
NOW, I HEAR YOU, I SEE YOU.

20:06.440 --> 20:09.307
- THAT GIVES ME THE CREEPS.

20:10.550 --> 20:12.336
- I'M GOING TO STOP
AT THE STOP SIGN.

20:12.380 --> 20:13.688
- JUST RELAX.
- I'M STOPPING RIGHT HERE.

20:13.720 --> 20:15.517
- YOU'RE NOT LISTENING
TO ME AT ALL.

20:15.550 --> 20:16.653
- I'M LISTENING TO YOU.
I'M STOPPED.

20:16.690 --> 20:18.510
- I'M THE ONE WITH THE DRIVER'S
LICENSE. YOU'RE NOT.

20:18.560 --> 20:20.209
NOW DO YOUR COUNTING.

20:20.250 --> 20:22.593
- ONE CRANBERRY,
TWO CRANBERRY...

20:22.630 --> 20:23.722
[horn honks]

20:23.770 --> 20:26.216
- IF SOMEBODY TOOTS LIKE THAT,
DON'T GET FRAZZLED.

20:26.250 --> 20:28.115
OKAY, NOW, PROCEED.
MAKE A RIGHT.

20:28.150 --> 20:30.289
[horn honks]
- YEAH, I'M FINE.

20:30.330 --> 20:32.150
I'M MAKING A RIGHT.
I'M MAKING A RIGHT.

20:32.190 --> 20:33.361
- WAIT!

20:35.640 --> 20:38.609
- HEY, DAD...
- DO NOT BLAME ME, OKAY?

20:38.650 --> 20:40.368
DON'T BLAME THIS ALL
ON ME, OKAY?

20:40.410 --> 20:41.854
YOU HAVE TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT
OF RESPONSIBILITY.

20:41.890 --> 20:43.403
- YOU WERE THE ONE
BEHIND THE WHEEL.

20:43.440 --> 20:45.442
- IF IT WAS JUST ME
BEHIND THE WHEEL,

20:45.480 --> 20:47.277
I WOULD HAVE BEEN CALM.
- WE HAD AN ACCIDENT.

20:47.310 --> 20:49.346
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU HAD AN ACCIDENT?

20:49.380 --> 20:50.347
DID ANYBODY GET HURT?

20:50.380 --> 20:51.824
- WE DIDN'T HAVE
AN ACCIDENT.

20:51.870 --> 20:53.030
- WELL, I'M A LITTLE HURT.

20:53.070 --> 20:54.822
WE'RE LUCKY TO BE STANDING HERE
RIGHT NOW, ACTUALLY.

20:54.870 --> 20:57.418
- DO NOT MAKE THIS INTO A THING.
- IT IS A THING.

20:57.460 --> 20:59.314
- YOU'RE EXAGGERATING.
- I'M NOT EXAGGERATING.

20:59.360 --> 21:00.588
YOU DON'T LISTEN TO ME.

21:00.630 --> 21:02.871
- OKAY, HEY, HEY,
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY CAR?

21:02.910 --> 21:04.901
- TELL HIM WHAT HAPPENED.
GO AHEAD.

21:04.950 --> 21:06.281
- YOU'RE GONNA LAUGH.

21:06.330 --> 21:09.049
YOU'RE GONNA LAUGH.
- YOU'RE GONNA LAUGH HARD.

21:09.090 --> 21:10.364
- I SWIPED THE MIRROR.
THAT'S IT.

21:10.400 --> 21:11.571
- THAT'S IT?
JUST THE SIDE MIRROR?

21:11.610 --> 21:12.816
- THAT'S IT.
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY IT.

21:12.850 --> 21:14.647
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"THAT'S IT"?

21:14.680 --> 21:16.432
- I MEAN, THAT'S IT.
THAT IS REALITY.

21:16.480 --> 21:18.095
- THE WHOLE THING IS--

21:18.130 --> 21:19.267
- HONEY, IT'S JUST THE MIRROR.

21:19.310 --> 21:20.709
- YOU SHOULD BE THE ONE
TO TEACH ME. MAYBE I WAS RIGHT.

21:20.760 --> 21:21.681
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
THANKS FOR BRINGING IT UP.

21:21.720 --> 21:23.278
I HATE THE FACT
THAT YOU GO BEHIND MY BACK

21:23.310 --> 21:24.754
AND ASK YOUR DAD TO TEACH YOU.

21:24.800 --> 21:26.244
I'M YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE COACH.
- WELL, YOU'RE SO CRAZY

21:26.280 --> 21:28.316
THAT YOU THINK YOU'RE A COACH.
- DON'T EVER CALL ME CRAZY.

21:28.350 --> 21:29.487
- LET DAD BE MY COACH.

21:29.520 --> 21:30.930
- I WILL NEVER LET YOU

21:30.970 --> 21:32.835
CONVINCE ME TO TAKE HER
ON THE ROAD EVER AGAIN.

21:32.870 --> 21:34.428
SHE'S NOT READY.
- DAD.

21:34.460 --> 21:35.597
- WHAT?
- ARE YOU GUYS

21:35.630 --> 21:36.733
HAVING AN ARGUMENT?
- NO, NO.

21:36.770 --> 21:38.078
- WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE.

21:38.120 --> 21:39.803
I THINK YOU'RE DEFINITELY
HAVING AN ARGUMENT.

21:39.850 --> 21:41.249
- WE'RE NOT HAVING
AN ARGUMENT.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.608
JUST LET ME--
LET ME TALK TO HER.

21:42.640 --> 21:44.369
- IT SOUNDS
LIKE YOU'RE HAVING AN ARGUMENT.

21:44.400 --> 21:46.197
TELL MOM TO COUNT BACKWARDS
FROM 30

21:46.230 --> 21:48.221
AND TO TAKE DEEP BREATHS.
- OKAY.

21:48.270 --> 21:49.851
- THEY'RE GOOD
COPING MECHANISMS.

21:49.890 --> 21:51.744
HEY, MILES.

21:51.790 --> 21:53.849
I THINK HADDIE'S
STILL MAD AT MOM.

21:53.890 --> 21:56.404
- I'M GONNA KILL YOU.
- AND SHE WANTS TO KILL ME.

21:56.450 --> 21:57.997
- HEY, KRISTINA.
- WHAT?

21:58.040 --> 21:59.860
- I LOVE YOU,
AND I APPRECIATE

21:59.900 --> 22:01.447
EVERYTHING YOU DO
FOR OUR CHILDREN.

22:01.490 --> 22:03.310
- OKAY, SPIT IT OUT.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SAY?

22:03.350 --> 22:04.624
- IS IT POSSIBLE
THAT YOU'RE BEING

22:04.660 --> 22:06.241
A LITTLE IRRATIONAL
WITH HADDIE?

22:06.290 --> 22:07.450
- I'M BEING IRRATIONAL?

22:07.490 --> 22:08.866
I'M BEING IRRATIONAL?
- I DIDN'T SAY--

22:08.910 --> 22:09.934
- HONEY, SHE JUST CRASHED
THE CAR.

22:09.980 --> 22:11.948
- YOU KNOW, I JUST THINK,
THIS IS A BIG STEP.

22:11.980 --> 22:12.833
- HUGE STEP.
- OKAY?

22:12.880 --> 22:14.256
OUR DAUGHTER IS LEARNING
HOW TO DRIVE.

22:14.290 --> 22:15.086
- ABSOLUTELY.
- IT'S SYMBOLIC.

22:15.120 --> 22:16.803
AND MAYBE IT'S NOT EASY
FOR YOU...

22:16.850 --> 22:19.159
- I AM NOT BEING IRRATIONAL,
ADAM, OKAY?

22:19.190 --> 22:20.293
YOU WEREN'T THERE.
I WAS.

22:20.330 --> 22:22.400
OUR DAUGHTER SUCKS AT DRIVING.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

22:22.440 --> 22:24.123
SO BUTT OUT.

22:24.990 --> 22:26.639
[door slams]

22:26.690 --> 22:28.612
- OKAY.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.299
- HI.
- OH, HEY.

22:35.350 --> 22:35.896
WHOO.

22:35.940 --> 22:38.101
I THOUGHT YOU WERE ZEEK.

22:38.140 --> 22:39.072
- WHAT YOU DOING?

22:39.110 --> 22:40.793
- WELL, I JUST THOUGHT
I'D, UH, SNEAK IN

22:40.840 --> 22:43.661
AND FIX THIS LEAK
WITHOUT YOUR FATHER KNOWING,

22:43.700 --> 22:45.588
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT HE'S DOING,

22:45.640 --> 22:49.326
AND I THOUGHT I'D COME IN HERE
BEFORE WE "FIX IT" TOMORROW.

22:49.360 --> 22:50.634
- THEN WHAT
ARE YOU GONNA TELL HIM?

22:50.670 --> 22:53.434
- I'LL JUST BE LIKE, "WOW, THAT
SEEMED A LOT WORSE YESTERDAY,

22:53.470 --> 22:55.017
BUT NOW HERE WE ARE."

22:55.060 --> 22:57.813
DON'T WORRY. I GOT A WHOLE PLAN.
IT'S GONNA BE PRETTY AWESOME.

22:57.850 --> 23:00.785
- THAT'S AMAZING THAT YOU JUST
KNOW HOW TO FIX THAT.

23:00.820 --> 23:02.299
- OH, YEAH,
WELL, YOU KNOW,

23:02.340 --> 23:06.515
IT'S WHAT I DID
BEFORE I DID, UH, PLAYDATES

23:06.550 --> 23:10.065
AND JUICE BOXES
AND ALL THAT.

23:10.110 --> 23:11.793
- HMM.

23:12.900 --> 23:13.719
- WHAT?

23:13.770 --> 23:14.930
- WHAT?

23:18.390 --> 23:21.700
- COME ON.
COME ON.

23:21.740 --> 23:25.392
- I WONDER IF I COULD ASK YOU
TO BUILD ME SOMETHING.

23:25.430 --> 23:26.909
- OKAY.

23:29.540 --> 23:33.544
- I WONDER
IF YOU WOULD BUILD ME A DESK.

23:33.580 --> 23:35.548
- I'D LOVE TO.
- REALLY?

23:35.580 --> 23:37.468
- WHAT KIND--WHAT KIND OF DESK
ARE WE TALKING?

23:37.510 --> 23:38.477
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA USE IT FOR?

23:38.520 --> 23:40.408
- YOU KNOW, I HAD THIS IDEA
THE OTHER DAY.

23:40.450 --> 23:42.418
UM...

23:42.450 --> 23:45.203
IT WAS FOR A SHOE
FOR ADAM'S COMPANY.

23:45.250 --> 23:47.650
IF A KID LOST THEIR SHOE,
YOU CLICK SOMETHING,

23:47.700 --> 23:49.383
AND THE SHOE WOULD BEEP,
AND THEN THEY COULD FIND IT.

23:49.420 --> 23:51.388
- I LOVE THAT IDEA.
- REALLY?

23:51.430 --> 23:53.239
- YEAH. I'D BUY A DOZEN
OF THOSE FOR SYDNEY.

23:53.290 --> 23:55.906
- SO...
- YEAH.

23:55.950 --> 23:57.463
- I JUST STARTED THINKING,
YOU KNOW,

23:57.500 --> 24:00.253
IF I HAD A SPACE
TO HAVE MORE IDEAS,

24:00.300 --> 24:01.847
MAYBE I'D HAVE MORE IDEAS.
- YEAH.

24:01.880 --> 24:03.677
I GET YA.

24:03.710 --> 24:07.191
MAKES SENSE TO ME.
YEAH.

24:07.230 --> 24:10.199
[low-key music]

24:11.690 --> 24:13.749
- HELLO.
YEAH, PLEASE...

24:13.790 --> 24:15.587
COME IN
AND LOOK OVER MY SHOULDER, MAX.

24:15.620 --> 24:17.485
DON'T KNOCK.
- OKAY.

24:17.520 --> 24:19.795
ARE YOU STILL MAD AT MOM?

24:19.830 --> 24:22.583
- I WAS BEING SARCASTIC.
YEAH, I AM.

24:22.630 --> 24:25.485
- CAN YOU HELP ME
GET MY SLEEPOVER SET UP?

24:25.530 --> 24:27.418
- [sighs]
YEAH.

24:27.460 --> 24:29.769
- YOU KNOW,
BECAUSE GABY MADE ME

24:29.810 --> 24:34.042
A "HOW TO HAVE
A SUCCESSFUL SLEEPOVER" LIST.

24:34.090 --> 24:36.399
AND ONE OF THE THINGS
IS TO MAKE YOUR GUEST

24:36.440 --> 24:37.395
FEEL AT HOME.

24:37.440 --> 24:39.010
SO I'M GONNA PUT UP
A BUNCH

24:39.060 --> 24:40.266
OF PICTURES OF NEW YORK

24:40.300 --> 24:43.406
AROUND THE TOP BUNK
WHERE JABBAR'S GONNA SLEEP.

24:43.440 --> 24:46.238
DID YOU KNOW THAT,
WITH OVER 6,400 CARS,

24:46.270 --> 24:48.306
NEW YORK HAS THE LARGEST FLEET
OF SUBWAY CARS IN THE WORLD?

24:48.340 --> 24:51.377
- MAX, WILL YOU LEAVE, AND I'LL
TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS LATER?

24:51.420 --> 24:52.239
- OKAY.
- CAN YOU JUST GO?

24:52.280 --> 24:54.794
GIVE ME A MINUTE, ALL RIGHT.
- OKAY.

24:54.830 --> 24:57.310
- GREAT. THANK YOU.
- ONE, TWO...

24:57.350 --> 24:58.339
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
STOP.

24:58.390 --> 24:59.869
- YOU SAID A MINUTE, 60 SECONDS.
- I DON'T CARE.

24:59.910 --> 25:01.070
I'LL JUST BE THERE LATER.
- FIVE...

25:01.120 --> 25:03.145
- GET OUT OF MY ROOM.
- SIX, SEVEN...

25:03.190 --> 25:04.282
- MAX, LEAVE MY ROOM.

25:04.330 --> 25:06.469
ARE YOU AN IDIOT?
LEAVE THE ROOM!

25:06.500 --> 25:08.639
- HEY!
- LEAVE!

25:08.670 --> 25:10.467
- NINE, TEN...

25:10.500 --> 25:12.741
ELEVEN...

25:15.580 --> 25:17.093
- [whispering]
CAN YOU SEE HIM?

25:17.130 --> 25:20.611
- HI, BUDDY.
- [normal voice] HE'S AWAKE.

25:20.650 --> 25:22.447
- THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

25:22.480 --> 25:24.539
- I GOT MY FIX.
- THAT'S OUR BOY.

25:24.590 --> 25:26.820
- HEY, SO I WAS THINKING,
UM, FRIDAY NIGHT,

25:26.870 --> 25:29.179
JABBAR WILL BE AT MAX'S
FOR THE SLEEPOVER.

25:29.210 --> 25:30.279
- MM-HMM.

25:30.320 --> 25:33.346
- AND WE'LL BE BACK HERE
MAKING THE BOAT ROCK,

25:33.390 --> 25:34.937
DON'T COME KNOCKING.
- [scoffs]

25:34.980 --> 25:37.699
- AND THEN SATURDAY, YOU KNOW,
MY MOM'S GONNA WANT

25:37.740 --> 25:39.423
TO STUFF HIM
FULL OF LASAGNA,

25:39.460 --> 25:42.839
SO I WAS THINKING SATURDAY NIGHT
AT MY PARENTS' HOUSE,

25:42.880 --> 25:46.179
AND THEN SUNDAY WE KIND OF HAVE
TO GO TO JULIA'S,

25:46.230 --> 25:48.323
BECAUSE SHE'S GOT
THIS NEW, WEIRD THING

25:48.370 --> 25:50.679
WHERE SHE THINKS NO ONE WANTS
TO GO TO HER HOUSE,

25:50.720 --> 25:52.506
WHICH IS KIND OF TRUE.

25:52.550 --> 25:55.189
- CROSBY, SWEETIE,
SLOW DOWN.

25:55.240 --> 25:56.446
WHAT ABOUT MY FAMILY?

25:56.480 --> 25:58.368
- YOU'RE NOT AN ORPHAN.
THAT'S RIGHT.

25:58.410 --> 26:00.230
- RIGHT.
- SORR--YEAH.

26:00.280 --> 26:01.269
SORRY, I FORGOT.

26:01.310 --> 26:02.652
YOU PROBABLY WANT
TO SEE THEM.

26:02.690 --> 26:05.557
- [sighs]
I REALLY CAN'T EVEN THINK

26:05.590 --> 26:08.309
ABOUT ALL THIS RIGHT NOW.

26:08.350 --> 26:11.729
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU CAN'T
THINK ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW?

26:11.770 --> 26:14.216
- WELL, I'M A LITTLE BUSY.

26:14.260 --> 26:16.569
I'VE GOT JABBAR.

26:16.600 --> 26:18.807
I'VE GOT REHEARSALS.

26:18.850 --> 26:20.499
- MM.

26:20.540 --> 26:22.644
- YOU'RE PISSED?
YOU'RE PISSED.

26:22.680 --> 26:24.648
- NO, I'M NOT--NO.

26:24.680 --> 26:27.092
- IT'S OKAY IF YOU ARE.
SAY WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND.

26:27.130 --> 26:30.167
- I LOVE JABBAR,
AND--AND I LOVE YOU,

26:30.200 --> 26:32.065
AND I MISS YOU GUYS.

26:32.100 --> 26:33.727
AND I FEEL
LIKE I'M THE ONLY ONE

26:33.760 --> 26:36.649
THAT'S PUTTING ANY EFFORT
INTO THIS RELATIONSHIP.

26:36.690 --> 26:39.170
I'VE BEEN FLYING BACK AND FORTH
EVERY OTHER WEEK.

26:39.210 --> 26:40.768
AND NOW
THAT YOU'RE FINALLY COMING,

26:40.800 --> 26:41.937
YOU CAN'T EVEN TALK ABOUT IT?

26:41.970 --> 26:45.599
- WELL, I WANT TO BE
WITH YOU TOO.

26:45.630 --> 26:46.619
I MISS YOU.

26:46.670 --> 26:48.353
- YEAH? YOU SURE?

26:48.390 --> 26:50.631
- I DO.
- ALL RIGHT.

26:50.670 --> 26:53.366
- HOLD ON ONE SECOND.

26:53.400 --> 26:55.504
- TAKE YOUR TIME GETTING THERE.
IT'S A GOOD SHOT.

26:55.540 --> 26:56.632
- SHH. NOT SO LOUD.

26:56.680 --> 26:58.398
- SORRY.
- I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE

26:58.440 --> 26:59.464
THAT HE WAS SLEEPING.

26:59.510 --> 27:01.262
THEY MUST HAVE MADE
THIS SKYPE THING

27:01.300 --> 27:04.952
FOR SOMETHING OTHER
THAN JUST TALKING.

27:06.720 --> 27:10.133
- OH, MY GOD.
ARE WE ABOUT TO HAVE SKYPE SEX?

27:10.180 --> 27:12.034
- UH-HUH.
UH-HUH.

27:12.070 --> 27:15.073
- 'CAUSE I HEARD
THIS CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS.

27:15.110 --> 27:17.169
OH, MY GOODNESS.
WAIT--WAIT FOR ME.

27:17.220 --> 27:20.212
OKAY, GO SLOWER, THOUGH.
OH, MY GOODNESS.

27:20.250 --> 27:22.559
- WHY DON'T YOU GO LAY DOWN
ON THE COUCH

27:22.600 --> 27:23.703
OR THE BED OR WHATEVER?

27:23.740 --> 27:27.119
- OKAY, YEAH, I'M GOING
TO THE BEDROOM.

27:27.160 --> 27:29.253
DANCE A LITTLE SLOWER,
THOUGH, OKAY?

27:29.300 --> 27:30.562
- YOU READY?

27:30.610 --> 27:32.669
- THIS IS FANTASTIC.

27:37.340 --> 27:40.093
WAIT. DID YOU JUST STOP MOVING,
OR IS IT--

27:40.140 --> 27:42.028
- OH, YEAH.
- NO, YOU'RE BREAKING--HOLD ON.

27:42.070 --> 27:44.618
- YOU READY?
- I THINK I'M IN A DEAD ZONE.

27:44.660 --> 27:45.649
I GOT TO GO BACK TO THE--

27:45.690 --> 27:47.169
- YEAH?
- OKAY.

27:47.210 --> 27:48.484
JASMINE?
- CROSBY?

27:48.520 --> 27:50.579
- HOLD ON.
DON'T--DON'T--DON'T STOP.

27:50.630 --> 27:53.042
STRONGER SIGNAL,
BUT DON'T STOP.

27:53.080 --> 27:56.208
COME ON.
[laughs with frustration]

27:56.260 --> 27:57.943
COME ON!
JASMINE!

28:01.230 --> 28:02.185
- HEY.

28:02.230 --> 28:03.811
- HEY.

28:03.850 --> 28:05.670
- SORRY, I SHOULD HAVE CALLED.

28:05.710 --> 28:06.779
IT'S A BAD TIME?
- NOPE.

28:06.820 --> 28:07.980
NOPE. COME ON IN.
WHAT'S UP?

28:08.030 --> 28:09.531
- HI. NOTHING.
- GOOD.

28:09.580 --> 28:11.616
HOW ARE THINGS AT THE HOUSE?
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE ROOF?

28:11.650 --> 28:12.958
- JOEL'S WORKING ON IT, AND...

28:13.000 --> 28:15.616
- GOOD.

28:15.650 --> 28:16.992
- THE SHOE THING WAS AN IDEA--

28:17.040 --> 28:18.519
- YEAH, LISTEN,
HOLD ON ONE SECOND, OKAY?

28:18.550 --> 28:19.653
SARAH, HOLD ON ONE SECOND.

28:19.690 --> 28:21.169
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS
IN ONE SECOND.

28:21.210 --> 28:23.963
HEY, IT'S JUST MY SISTER.
I'LL JUST BE A MINUTE.

28:24.010 --> 28:25.693
HEY. LISTEN, WE GOT
TO WRAP THIS UP.

28:25.730 --> 28:27.732
I GOT TO HAVE A LITTLE MEETING
ACROSS THE HALL.

28:27.770 --> 28:29.806
- RIGHT. OKAY.
IT WAS MY IDEA.

28:29.840 --> 28:32.707
AND I FEEL LIKE YOU JUST
KIND OF TOOK IT.

28:32.740 --> 28:36.016
- [stammering] SARAH, LOOK,
YOU KNOW, YOU SAID THAT TO ME

28:36.050 --> 28:38.678
IN AN OFFHAND WAY
THAT MORNING.

28:38.710 --> 28:39.506
- MM-HMM.
- IT'S NOT LIKE WE SAT DOWN

28:39.540 --> 28:41.747
AND HAD
AN OFFICIAL PITCH MEETING.

28:41.780 --> 28:43.122
- OH, I DIDN'T KNOW--
I DIDN'T KNOW WE HAD

28:43.160 --> 28:44.366
TO HAVE AN OFFICIAL MEETING.

28:44.410 --> 28:46.025
MAYBE WE SHOULD TAKE IT
TO THE PEOPLE'S COURT

28:46.060 --> 28:47.539
OR, YOU KNOW,
CALL JUDGE JUDY.

28:47.580 --> 28:49.093
- YOU KNOW, SARAH, LET'S NOT
HAVE A FIGHT ABOUT THIS.

28:49.140 --> 28:50.641
- SERIOUSLY, I DIDN'T KNOW
WE HAD TO HAVE A MEETING.

28:50.690 --> 28:51.998
OKAY, ADAM, I HAD AN IDEA,
AND I FEEL

28:52.040 --> 28:53.610
LIKE IF I DON'T START
TO VALUE MY IDEAS,

28:53.660 --> 28:55.628
I'M GONNA DISAPPEAR.

28:55.660 --> 28:56.649
LET ME BE PART OF IT.

28:56.700 --> 28:58.861
- GOD, SARAH, I'VE DONE,
LIKE, A MILLION THINGS

28:58.900 --> 29:00.379
FOR YOU OVER THE YEARS,
AND I'VE NEVER ASKED

29:00.420 --> 29:02.422
FOR MORE THAN A THANK-YOU.

29:04.500 --> 29:08.084
- WELL, I'M ASKING FOR MORE.

29:21.200 --> 29:23.998
- NO.
NO, WAIT, MAYBE HEX.

29:24.030 --> 29:25.099
- I'M USING FLATHEADS.

29:25.140 --> 29:26.402
- YEAH, I KNOW
YOU'RE USING FLATHEADS,

29:26.450 --> 29:27.758
BUT IT'S THE WRONG SCREW.

29:27.800 --> 29:28.869
THEY'RE GONNA POP
RIGHT THROUGH THE SHINGLE.

29:28.900 --> 29:30.754
- IT'S NOT THE WRONG SCREW.
FLATHEADS ARE FINE.

29:30.800 --> 29:33.724
- YOU KNOW,
I CAN'T--

29:33.770 --> 29:34.976
I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE.

29:35.010 --> 29:36.659
EVERYTHING YOU'RE DOING
IS WRONG.

29:36.700 --> 29:37.974
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

29:38.010 --> 29:39.079
AND IF THERE'S ONE THING
I CAN'T STAND,

29:39.120 --> 29:43.329
IT'S DOING A JOB BADLY,
AND YOU ARE DOING THIS...

29:43.360 --> 29:44.668
SO BADLY.

29:44.710 --> 29:46.325
IT'S LIKE--IT'S EVEN WORSE

29:46.370 --> 29:48.122
THAT YOU'RE TREATING ME LIKE
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING,

29:48.160 --> 29:49.434
WHEN I'M A CERTIFIED CONTRACTOR

29:49.470 --> 29:52.268
WHO GOT PAID, BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
A LOT OF MONEY

29:52.300 --> 29:56.168
TO DO WHAT YOU HAVE--
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO DO.

29:57.830 --> 29:59.639
- WHAT, IS THAT IT?
- NOT REMOTELY.

29:59.690 --> 30:00.714
- REALLY?
- YES.

30:00.760 --> 30:02.443
- WELL, LET ME HEAR
THE REST OF IT.

30:02.490 --> 30:05.448
- I HATE THAT YOU TREAT ME
LIKE I'M MY DAUGHTER'S AGE.

30:05.490 --> 30:06.821
I'M A GROWN-ASS MAN.

30:06.870 --> 30:08.792
AND IF I DIDN'T HAVE
A RECESSION

30:08.840 --> 30:11.001
WHERE I COULDN'T AFFORD
TO PAY MY TEAM,

30:11.050 --> 30:12.597
I'D BE UP HERE...
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

30:12.630 --> 30:14.837
- DOING THIS JOB WITH SEVERAL
OTHER MORE QUALIFIED PEOPLE

30:14.880 --> 30:16.871
THAN YOURSELF.
- GOT SOME ANGER IN THERE, HUH?

30:16.910 --> 30:19.424
- WELL...
- A LITTLE SPIRIT--I LIKE THAT.

30:19.470 --> 30:22.633
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER HEARD
YOU SAY MORE THAN FIVE WORDS

30:22.680 --> 30:24.739
SINCE I KNEW YOU.
- WELL...

30:24.780 --> 30:27.192
- NO, REALLY.

30:27.230 --> 30:29.744
I HEAR YOU.
AND I SEE YOU.

30:29.790 --> 30:33.135
THAT'S COMING
FROM MY COUNSELING SESSIONS.

30:33.170 --> 30:35.035
IT'S WORKING, HUH?
- THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.

30:35.070 --> 30:37.925
- YOU COULD BENEFIT FROM IT.
YOU GOT SOME ANGER ISSUES.

30:37.970 --> 30:39.824
I GOT TO TELL YOU,
I LIKE IT.

30:39.870 --> 30:42.009
IT'S SPUNKY.

30:43.870 --> 30:47.977
[telephone rings]

30:48.010 --> 30:50.319
- HELLO?
- HEY, IT'S ME.

30:50.360 --> 30:51.736
- HEY.

30:51.780 --> 30:53.839
- YOU'RE GONNA HATE ME.

30:53.880 --> 30:56.121
- I'M NOT GONNA HATE YOU.
I LIKE YOU.

30:56.160 --> 30:59.152
I'M COUNTING DOWN THE HOURS.

30:59.200 --> 31:02.545
- UH, I CAN'T COME OUT.

31:06.720 --> 31:08.062
- I HATE YOU.

31:08.100 --> 31:12.799
- IT'S DOWN TO ME
AND ONE OTHER PERSON

31:12.830 --> 31:14.582
FOR THAT UNDERSTUDY PART.

31:14.630 --> 31:17.519
WELL, IT'S, UH--

31:17.560 --> 31:19.972
IT'S FOR A GOOD REASON.

31:20.010 --> 31:23.184
I CAN'T PASS THIS UP.

31:28.850 --> 31:31.227
[telephone rings]

31:32.540 --> 31:35.646
- GORDON, YOU GOT A MINUTE?
- COME ON IN.

31:38.060 --> 31:40.620
- IT WASN'T MY IDEA--
THE SHOE CLICKER.

31:40.650 --> 31:41.890
MY SISTER CAME UP WITH IT.

31:41.930 --> 31:43.852
I DON'T KNOW WHY I LIED
ABOUT IT, BUT I DID.

31:43.900 --> 31:45.037
- HOW CAN I PUT THIS?

31:45.070 --> 31:47.345
UM, I DON'T GIVE
A RAT'S ASS.

31:47.380 --> 31:49.382
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
I'LL--I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

31:49.420 --> 31:51.035
ALL RIGHT? SORRY.
- LISTEN, YOU KNOW,

31:51.080 --> 31:52.968
YOU SAY THAT YOUR FAMILY'S
NOT A DISTRACT ION,

31:53.010 --> 31:54.102
BUT EVERY TIME I TURN AROUND,

31:54.150 --> 31:56.209
WE'VE GOT ANOTHER CRISIS
ON OUR HANDS.

31:56.250 --> 31:57.387
- YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW.

31:57.430 --> 31:58.943
- IF YOU'RE
JUST GONNA PHONE IT IN--

31:58.980 --> 32:00.732
- HEY, GORDON,
NOBODY'S PHONING IT IN.

32:00.780 --> 32:02.395
- YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

32:02.430 --> 32:05.228
I NEED YOU HERE, ADAM,
FOCUSED.

32:05.260 --> 32:07.888
YOU ARE AN ESSENTIAL PART
OF THIS COMPANY, OKAY?

32:07.920 --> 32:10.263
AND WE'RE IN TROUBLE.

32:14.440 --> 32:15.953
- ALL RIGHT.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.855

UNCLE CROSBY!

32:21.970 --> 32:24.029

32:25.970 --> 32:28.029
LOOK AT ALL THIS.
- IT'S GONNA BE SO AWESOME.

32:28.080 --> 32:30.173
CHECK IT OUT--
JABBAR'S FAVORITE,

32:30.220 --> 32:33.667
ORANGE SODA AND...
- HE LOVES THAT.

32:33.710 --> 32:34.972
- AND SUN CHIPS.

32:35.020 --> 32:36.282
MY MOM SAID THAT IT'S OKAY
FOR ME TO HAVE FOOD

32:36.330 --> 32:37.979
IN MY ROOM
JUST THIS ONE TIME.

32:38.020 --> 32:39.089
- GOOD JOB.
- SO EAT IT NOW

32:39.120 --> 32:40.769
BECAUSE THIS IS GONNA BE
PROBABLY YOUR LAST CHANCE

32:40.820 --> 32:42.879
TO EVER EAT FOOD IN MY ROOM.
- OKAY. MAYBE LATER, THOUGH.

32:42.920 --> 32:45.332
- OKAY.
- UM, IS EVERYONE...?

32:45.370 --> 32:47.122
- EVERYONE'S OUT.

32:51.760 --> 32:53.341

32:53.380 --> 32:54.756
I LOVE IT. I LOVE IT.
- HEY, BUDDY?

32:54.800 --> 32:55.960
I HAVE SOME BAD NEWS.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.934
THERE'S BEEN A CHANGE IN PLAN,

32:57.970 --> 32:59.961
AND, UH, JABBAR CAN'T COME.

33:00.010 --> 33:02.763
- YES, HE CAN.
HE'S FLYING TOMORROW--

33:02.800 --> 33:05.974

OAKLAND INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT,

33:06.010 --> 33:07.489

33:07.530 --> 33:11.045
- OKAY, BUT HE CHANGED PLANS.
- NO, HE HAS A TICKET.

33:11.090 --> 33:13.012
- YEAH, BUT THERE
WAS A CHANGE OF PLAN.

33:13.060 --> 33:16.951
- MAX, I'M SURE HE CAN COME BACK
AGAIN SOON, RIGHT?

33:16.990 --> 33:18.127
- YEAH, HOPEFULLY,

33:18.160 --> 33:19.843
BUT, YOU KNOW,
WHO KNOWS AT THIS POINT?

33:19.890 --> 33:21.949
- WHAT? NO!
THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE!

33:22.000 --> 33:24.400
NO, THIS SUCKS!
- MAX, MAX, BUDDY, BUDDY.

33:24.450 --> 33:25.997
I'M IN THE SAME BOAT
AS YOU ARE.

33:26.030 --> 33:27.349
WHOA! HEY, HEY.
- NO! NO!

33:27.380 --> 33:30.656
[shouting
and overlapping talking]

33:30.690 --> 33:33.272

33:33.320 --> 33:35.629
CALM DOWN. MAX.

33:35.660 --> 33:37.548

REMEMBER?
OKAY.

33:39.180 --> 33:41.250
LISTEN, I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET.

33:41.290 --> 33:43.110
YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT
TO BE, OKAY?

33:43.150 --> 33:44.219
IT'S NOT FAIR.
- NO!

33:44.260 --> 33:47.149
- MAX, I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET.
I'M UPSET TOO, OKAY?

33:47.190 --> 33:48.669
I AM.
AND IT'S NOT FAIR.

33:48.710 --> 33:49.984
I KNOW, ALL RIGHT?

33:50.020 --> 33:51.499
MAX, LOOK AT ME.

33:51.540 --> 33:54.782
BUT IT'S NOT GONNA HELP
TO KICK AND SCREAM AND YELL.

33:54.820 --> 33:56.469
MAX, LOOK AT ME.
ALL RIGHT?

33:56.510 --> 33:58.091
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO TRY AND CALM DOWN

33:58.130 --> 34:00.303
AND COME UP WITH ANOTHER PLAN,
ALL RIGHT?

34:00.340 --> 34:04.128
CALM DOWN AND COME UP
WITH A PLAN "B," OKAY?

34:04.180 --> 34:06.136
MAX, DEEP BREATH.
- I'M GONNA GO WATCH SOME TV.

34:06.180 --> 34:07.727
DO YOU WANT
SOME EXTRA SCREEN TIME?

34:07.760 --> 34:10.649
- NO TV, ACTUALLY.
MAYBE JUST A GLASS OF WATER.

34:10.700 --> 34:14.181
AND I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
- YEAH. YEAH.

34:15.810 --> 34:17.357
- YOU OKAY?
- WOW.

34:17.400 --> 34:19.561
UM, YEAH, I'VE NEVER SEEN
THAT SIDE OF HIM.

34:19.600 --> 34:21.568
- YEAH, HE'S GONNA LEARN
NOT TO DO THAT.

34:21.610 --> 34:23.328
IT JUST--
IT JUST TAKES A WHILE.

34:23.370 --> 34:24.985
- HMM.
GOOD--GOOD JOB, THOUGH.

34:25.020 --> 34:27.716
- THANKS.
- YEAH.

34:33.890 --> 34:36.518

I'M BACK IN THE GAME.

34:36.550 --> 34:38.927

JOEL CONTRIBUTED.

34:54.670 --> 34:55.989

34:56.020 --> 34:58.705
- YOUR FATHER LOVES ME.

34:58.750 --> 35:01.469
- HOW DOES THAT FEEL?

35:01.510 --> 35:03.023
- NOT SURE YET.

35:03.060 --> 35:05.301
- [sighs]

35:05.340 --> 35:06.955
I'M GOING BACK OUT THERE.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.922
I READ TEN 808H<S ON SEX ED.

35:08.960 --> 35:11.133
- I THINK I HAVE A LITTLE BIT
OF A BETTER HANDLE

35:11.170 --> 35:13.206
ON HOW TO EXPLAIN A PENIS
TO A SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

35:13.240 --> 35:16.755
- I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU CAN EXPLAIN SOMETHING--

35:16.800 --> 35:18.768
CAN WE JUST GIVE HER FIVE
OR SIX YEARS TO SHAKE OFF

35:18.800 --> 35:21.451
THE DAMAGE WE'VE DONE
AND THEN START FRESH?

35:21.490 --> 35:24.493
- NO, BABE.
I'M THE MOM.

35:24.530 --> 35:25.633
SHE'S A GIRL.

35:25.670 --> 35:28.184
YOU HAVE TO LET ME MAKE
THIS DECISION ON THIS ONE.

35:28.220 --> 35:29.494
- [chuckles]
YEAH.

35:29.540 --> 35:33.909
YEAH, AND IF WE HAD A BOY,
YOU'D LET ME HANDLE IT?

35:33.950 --> 35:36.339
WHAT?

35:39.550 --> 35:41.814
- IT'S--WHEN YOU SAID,
"IF WE HAD A BOY,"

35:41.860 --> 35:44.408
I PICTURED US HAVING A BOY.

35:44.450 --> 35:46.589
- OH.

35:46.620 --> 35:50.829
- I WANT HER TO HAVE
A BROTHER OR A SISTER.

35:50.870 --> 35:53.521
WE CAN'T WAIT FOREVER
ON THIS, YOU KNOW?

35:53.560 --> 35:55.903
WE ALWAYS SAID YOU COULD BUILD
A BEDROOM ABOVE THE GARAGE,

35:55.940 --> 35:57.316
SO THAT'S--
THAT IS PERFECT.

35:57.360 --> 35:58.759
- LET'S JUST HOLD ON A SECOND.
WHEN ARE YOU--

35:58.810 --> 36:00.949
- WHEN--
YES, THAT IS KEY.

36:00.980 --> 36:03.665
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY KEY.

36:05.710 --> 36:09.840
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE'RE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION.

- NEITHER CAN I.

36:31.600 --> 36:33.215
- HEY.

36:33.260 --> 36:35.660
- HEY.

36:35.710 --> 36:38.531
- WHAT YOU DOING?

36:38.570 --> 36:42.700
- I'M SORRY.
I'LL--I WILL PAY FOR IT.

36:42.750 --> 36:45.025
- OKAY.

36:45.060 --> 36:49.053
- SO I'M GONNA PAY
FOR IT, THEN?

36:49.100 --> 36:51.443
- I GUESS SO.
YOU JUST OFFERED.

36:51.480 --> 36:53.402
- I DON'T KNOW.
I FEEL STUPID ABOUT IT.

36:53.450 --> 36:55.589
JUST--
I DON'T HAVE MONEY.

36:55.620 --> 36:57.133
I DON'T HAVE MONEY
TO PAY FOR IT.

36:57.180 --> 36:59.751
- HADDIE, IT'S FINE.

37:01.870 --> 37:04.316
- I AM SORRY

37:04.360 --> 37:07.625
FOR THIS
AND FOR BEING RUDE TO YOU

37:07.670 --> 37:09.900
AND TREATING YOU
REALLY BADLY.

37:09.950 --> 37:11.429
AND, I DON'T KNOW,
I JUST--

37:11.470 --> 37:14.701
BUT I DO HAVE TO SAY TO YOU,
AND I DON'T MEAN THIS

37:14.740 --> 37:15.877
AS AN INSULT,

37:15.920 --> 37:20.675
BUT I FEEL LIKE YOU WERE BEING
A LITTLE BIT IRRATIONAL.

37:24.750 --> 37:26.377
- I WAS?
- YEAH.

37:26.410 --> 37:28.924
A LITTLE BIT...

37:28.970 --> 37:32.895
YOU KNOW,
A LITTLE OUT OF THE ORDINARY.

37:35.280 --> 37:37.032
- IT'S ABOUT
"CATASTROPHIZATION . "

37:37.080 --> 37:38.900
- OKAY.

37:38.940 --> 37:40.384
- "CATASTROPHIZATION."

37:40.430 --> 37:42.625
- THAT'S NOT A WORD.
- IT'S NOT A REAL WORD.

37:42.670 --> 37:45.559
BUT IT'S ONE
THAT YOUR DAD MADE UP FOR ME,

37:45.600 --> 37:47.636
'CAUSE I SOMETIMES
"CATASTROPHIZE" THINGS.

37:47.670 --> 37:50.810
YOU KNOW, I LOOK
INTO THE FUTURE, AND...

37:50.850 --> 37:52.579
I SEE THE WORST--

37:52.610 --> 37:54.464
YOU DRIVING THIS CAR,

37:54.510 --> 37:57.434
AND YOU GETTING IN A HORRIBLE,
AWFUL CAR ACCIDENT.

37:57.480 --> 38:01.234
AND ME HAVING TO GO DOWN
TO THE SCENE

38:01.270 --> 38:03.613
AND SEEING YOUR BODY
AND SMELL THE CARNAGE...

38:03.660 --> 38:05.207
- WHAT? MOM.
- AND I CAN SEE THE PEOPLE

38:05.240 --> 38:06.867
JUST SWARMING AROUND...
- STOP.

38:06.900 --> 38:07.992
STOP. STOP.

38:08.040 --> 38:10.656
- I JUST--I KNOW.
I'M SORRY.

38:10.700 --> 38:12.793
- THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

38:12.840 --> 38:15.001
- I KNOW.

38:16.670 --> 38:20.322
I JUST LOVE YOU
WAY TOO MUCH.

38:20.360 --> 38:23.773

WHAT I WOULD DO.

38:23.810 --> 38:24.606
- OKAY.

38:24.640 --> 38:25.777
- AND THEN I THINK
ABOUT MAX

38:25.820 --> 38:27.742
AND WHO'S GONNA TAKE CARE OF HIM
WHEN WE'RE NOT AROUND.

38:27.780 --> 38:29.600
- MOM, I WILL.

38:29.650 --> 38:30.810
- HONEY, I WOULD NEVER
DO THAT TO YOU.

38:30.860 --> 38:32.339
I WOULD NEVER PUT
THAT BURDEN ON YOU

38:32.370 --> 38:33.576
TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR BROTHER.

38:33.620 --> 38:35.019
I JUST--I WOULDN'T.

38:35.070 --> 38:38.096
- IT'S NOT A BURDEN.

38:38.140 --> 38:41.371
I LOVE MAX.
HE'S MY BROTHER.
