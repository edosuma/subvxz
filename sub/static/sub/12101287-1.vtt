WEBVTT

00:16.784 --> 00:18.318
Mr. President.

00:20.520 --> 00:21.989
We have to act now.

00:23.057 --> 00:24.992
They marched on Poland,

00:25.026 --> 00:26.359
and we did nothing.

00:27.294 --> 00:29.663
And they kept marching.

00:29.696 --> 00:33.300
They've taken control
of most of Europe. And Russia.

00:33.333 --> 00:34.769
- It's...
- An invasion.

00:34.802 --> 00:36.670
That's not all,
Mr. President.

00:36.704 --> 00:38.906
He's been searching
for ancient artifacts

00:38.940 --> 00:41.408
since 1933.

00:41.441 --> 00:43.845
You mean magical artifacts.

00:44.779 --> 00:46.781
Merciful heaven.

00:46.814 --> 00:48.348
What a maniac.

00:50.017 --> 00:52.319
Unless, of course...
he's right.

00:55.589 --> 00:59.060
I take it that's where
your big idea comes in?

00:59.093 --> 01:00.828
Let me introduce you
to the team.

01:00.862 --> 01:03.363
Rex Tyler, known as Hourman.

01:03.396 --> 01:06.333
He's one of the best scientists
America has to offer.

01:06.366 --> 01:08.770
Now, he's developed
a chemical called Miraclo

01:08.803 --> 01:11.773
to enhance speed,
strength, everything.

01:11.806 --> 01:13.273
An hour at a time.

01:14.407 --> 01:16.543
Then there's Dinah Lance.

01:16.576 --> 01:19.412
A bit of a fire brand with sonic sound abilities...

01:19.446 --> 01:20.614
...that have gotten her shunned
by her community.

01:22.016 --> 01:25.820
Next, since attaining
his powers of speed,

01:25.853 --> 01:28.455
Jay Garrick has been
a full-time crime fighter.

01:28.488 --> 01:30.091
And he's willing
to serve his country.

01:30.124 --> 01:32.526
Finally, Carter Hall,

01:32.559 --> 01:35.395
an ancient Egyptian
in a modern Egyptian's body.

01:35.428 --> 01:36.964
Oh, and he's got wings.

01:36.998 --> 01:40.101
Ancient Egyptian?
You can't be serious.

01:40.134 --> 01:41.635
Claims this is his

01:41.668 --> 01:43.905
fourth reincarnation.

01:43.938 --> 01:46.007
- He's one of ours?
- Yes, Sir.

01:46.040 --> 01:48.575
I see. Lights.

01:53.014 --> 01:54.648
And you think they're enough

01:54.681 --> 01:57.752
to fight back the Nazis
and magical artifacts?

01:57.785 --> 01:59.120
I know they are.

01:59.153 --> 02:03.423
But, who will lead
this motley crew?

02:03.456 --> 02:05.325
I think
I've got someone in mind.

02:11.598 --> 02:13.600
What do you say, Mr. President?

02:13.633 --> 02:15.569
Are you ready to end this war?

03:44.058 --> 03:46.693
I can't remember
if I locked the car.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.129
Or the apartment.

03:48.162 --> 03:49.764
Or turned off the coffee pot.

03:52.099 --> 03:55.136
Honestly Barry, I don't know
how you've survived this long.

03:59.974 --> 04:01.842
Hey, this is
our first trip to Metropolis,

04:01.876 --> 04:03.911
I want it to be perfect.

04:03.945 --> 04:05.980
According to the trajectory
of the sun,

04:06.013 --> 04:07.614
we should have
the max amount of light

04:07.647 --> 04:10.517
if we set the blanket... here.

04:18.826 --> 04:20.061
Think we'll see Superman?

04:21.695 --> 04:23.630
I thought you were
taking a day off.

04:24.631 --> 04:26.033
Right, right, you're right.

04:28.635 --> 04:30.237
I should have
brought sunscreen.

04:32.106 --> 04:34.507
- Can I get your back?
- Barry...

04:34.541 --> 04:36.543
Cold cuts, bread, mayo.
Oh, I forgot the cheese.

04:36.576 --> 04:38.511
No, Barry.

04:38.545 --> 04:40.181
Do you think it might rain?

04:40.214 --> 04:41.648
- I can grab an umbrella, just in case.
- Barry, just...

04:43.583 --> 04:44.651
focus.

04:46.120 --> 04:47.654
Everything okay?

04:48.289 --> 04:50.124
What are we doing?

04:50.157 --> 04:51.726
We're having a picnic.

04:51.759 --> 04:53.861
You wanted to get out of town,
away from...

04:53.894 --> 04:56.030
my other job.

04:56.063 --> 04:57.798
But, we're never fully away

04:57.832 --> 04:58.966
from your other job.

05:01.168 --> 05:02.703
That's not fair.

05:04.872 --> 05:08.075
It's who you are,
and I love that about you.

05:08.109 --> 05:11.678
But, Barry, it's been... years.

05:15.883 --> 05:17.118
What do you want from me?

05:17.151 --> 05:18.786
Is this just a fling?
Because I...

05:18.819 --> 05:20.287
No, no, Iris...

05:20.321 --> 05:22.923
It's okay if it is,
but I'm not interested in...

05:23.991 --> 05:25.059
I love you.

05:28.695 --> 05:30.765
It's just...

05:30.798 --> 05:33.100
the best way to keep you safe is
by making sure no one finds out.

05:37.938 --> 05:41.608
If you really believe that,
then break up with me, Barry Allen.

05:42.642 --> 05:43.944
Iris...

05:43.978 --> 05:46.679
Life is dangerous.

05:46.714 --> 05:48.615
It shouldn't stop us
from living it.

05:58.893 --> 06:01.295
Go. You have work to do.

06:04.732 --> 06:06.033
I... I'll make it up to you.

06:06.067 --> 06:07.902
Tomorrow. I promise.

06:25.286 --> 06:28.621
Resistance... is... illogical.

06:50.945 --> 06:53.680
I have you now, Superman.

07:00.754 --> 07:03.023
Superman! What can I do?

07:03.057 --> 07:05.426
Maybe help
with the tentacles?

07:05.459 --> 07:06.393
Right. Sure.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.283
Are you all right?

07:29.316 --> 07:31.919
I will be
after we take care of Brainiac.

07:31.952 --> 07:34.421
What do you say?
Interested in a team-up?

07:34.455 --> 07:35.856
I thought you'd never ask.

07:40.394 --> 07:42.695
Another meta.

07:42.730 --> 07:47.201
Chance of success down to 95%. Recalibrating.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.715
Accelerating projectile.

08:18.933 --> 08:20.201
Superman!

08:20.234 --> 08:24.038
Recalibration. Success at 99%.

08:35.983 --> 08:37.117
Are you okay?

08:37.151 --> 08:39.420
That gem... it's Kryptonite.

08:39.453 --> 08:40.988
It's the only thing
that can hurt me.

08:45.125 --> 08:46.994
But, you're like a God.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.996
So, what's the plan?

08:49.029 --> 08:50.497
Don't get hit. Avoid the beam.

08:50.531 --> 08:51.899
Punch really hard.

08:51.932 --> 08:52.900
Save the day.

08:53.400 --> 08:54.268
I like it.

09:12.353 --> 09:13.520
<i>Keep running!</i>

09:14.455 --> 09:16.190
<i>Follow my voice.</i>

11:19.714 --> 11:21.115
Any sign of him?

11:21.148 --> 11:22.282
Not yet.

11:22.316 --> 11:24.051
We should have gone with him.

11:24.084 --> 11:25.486
We had our own mission.

11:25.519 --> 11:26.954
We're running out of time.

11:26.987 --> 11:28.389
Rex's hour is almost up.

11:28.422 --> 11:30.457
If we don't leave soon,
civilians will die.

11:31.225 --> 11:32.960
We wait.

11:32.993 --> 11:35.229
Steve won't let us down.

11:35.262 --> 11:37.631
Go check on the left flank
and report back.

11:55.249 --> 11:57.719
What kind
of crazy gun was that?

11:57.752 --> 11:59.987
It will take more
than the speed of Hermes

12:00.020 --> 12:02.456
to stop an Amazon, fiend.

12:02.489 --> 12:03.624
Who are you?

12:07.494 --> 12:09.329
So, they've got
one of their own.

12:09.363 --> 12:10.732
Wait, what?

12:18.706 --> 12:21.675
Wonder Woman, what's the plan?

12:21.709 --> 12:23.243
Regroup with the others.

12:23.277 --> 12:25.045
Tell Carter
to take care of the planes.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.648
We need to buy more time.

12:27.681 --> 12:30.150
Did President Roosevelt
send you?

12:30.184 --> 12:31.518
President Roosevelt?

12:31.552 --> 12:33.620
What? What's happening?

12:35.322 --> 12:36.557
Keep an eye on...

12:37.324 --> 12:38.525
whatever this is.

12:39.560 --> 12:40.661
I got him, boss.

12:44.598 --> 12:47.067
Am I dead?

12:47.100 --> 12:49.203
Sometimes feels like it
in France.

12:49.704 --> 12:51.572
France?

12:54.041 --> 12:55.242
Someone's in trouble.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.543
Everyone's in trouble
right now.

12:56.577 --> 12:59.580
You're not going any... where.

13:17.431 --> 13:18.298
Nazis?

13:48.595 --> 13:53.267
What... what is...

13:53.300 --> 13:55.235
I've never been
out of breath before.

13:55.269 --> 13:56.470
Not again!

13:58.272 --> 13:59.506
Who've you got there,
Wonder Woman?

14:00.374 --> 14:01.375
Is he one of theirs?

14:03.343 --> 14:06.113
It's unlikely he'd be working
for the Germans.

14:06.146 --> 14:07.648
Right.

14:07.681 --> 14:10.150
So, I think
I know what's going on here.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.553
I can't... breathe.

14:18.125 --> 14:20.427
I'm... I'm from the future.

14:22.529 --> 14:23.831
Jay, report.

14:23.865 --> 14:27.134
Uh, it's not impossible.

14:27.167 --> 14:28.602
I mean, with the Speed Force.

14:28.635 --> 14:31.538
Sounds more like something
a Nazi would say.

14:31.572 --> 14:34.675
There are things that
we don't understand, forces...

14:34.709 --> 14:37.611
I don't want to hear
about reincarnation, Carter.

14:37.644 --> 14:39.112
Make him talk.

14:40.414 --> 14:41.816
What about your lasso?

14:41.849 --> 14:45.118
I'll get him to talk.

14:45.152 --> 14:46.888
We don't have time
to discuss this.

14:51.325 --> 14:54.428
We've got a fight to finish and I
have less than ten minutes left.

15:00.835 --> 15:02.436
Take cover!

15:17.317 --> 15:18.185
Wait!

15:19.386 --> 15:21.188
It's Steve!

15:34.668 --> 15:35.602
Hawkman!

15:39.506 --> 15:40.775
Based on the trajectory,

15:40.808 --> 15:42.744
the velocity,
Hawkman's wingspan...

15:42.777 --> 15:43.644
he won't make it.

15:47.514 --> 15:49.349
Come on! Come on!

16:04.899 --> 16:06.868
Let's try for
one piece, Trevor.

16:17.712 --> 16:20.514
Whoa! What's going on
with my speed?

16:20.547 --> 16:25.352
You got this.
Come on.

16:27.722 --> 16:28.890
What now, Red?

16:32.860 --> 16:34.327
A Flash classic.

17:05.392 --> 17:06.928
It's good
to see you, too, Princess.

17:14.902 --> 17:16.636
I see you picked up
another playmate?

17:17.739 --> 17:19.874
It seems I misjudged you.

17:19.907 --> 17:21.743
Thank you.

17:21.776 --> 17:22.642
Heh.

17:27.882 --> 17:30.383
- Retreat back to our extraction.
- Wait.

17:31.618 --> 17:33.453
They're gonna
tear this village apart.

17:33.487 --> 17:35.455
Look, I saw another division
headed this way.

17:35.489 --> 17:36.623
They're looking for me.

17:39.693 --> 17:40.895
We can't leave them.

17:42.362 --> 17:43.798
Spread out.

17:43.831 --> 17:45.665
Hourman, you and Jay
with me on the ground.

17:45.699 --> 17:48.002
Carter, you and Dinah
take the sky.

17:48.035 --> 17:50.337
- And I can do...
- Nothing.

17:50.370 --> 17:52.405
Look, if you really are
from the future,

17:52.439 --> 17:54.474
we can't complicate
the timeline.

17:54.508 --> 17:56.010
Oh, right.
I've seen that movie.

17:58.079 --> 18:01.314
Get Steve to the extraction
point in one piece.

18:01.348 --> 18:02.516
He'll lead the way.

18:06.053 --> 18:07.855
This is crazy.

18:07.889 --> 18:10.690
I've never seen this many
heroes working together.

18:10.725 --> 18:13.928
Kid,
you ain't seen nothin' yet.

18:17.865 --> 18:20.001
How come I've never heard about them?
About this?

18:20.600 --> 18:21.836
The JSA?

18:21.869 --> 18:23.537
Justice Society of America.

18:23.570 --> 18:25.706
Yeah I know. Corny.

18:25.740 --> 18:26.774
We're top secret.

18:26.808 --> 18:28.375
Real high-level stuff.

18:28.408 --> 18:30.477
Even have a war correspondent
embedded with us

18:30.510 --> 18:31.979
to spin the stories.

18:32.013 --> 18:34.648
Keep the super-powered team
off the front page.

18:34.681 --> 18:36.117
Why try and keep it a secret?

18:36.150 --> 18:37.819
This is the coolest thing
I've ever seen

18:37.852 --> 18:40.788
and I can run faster
than sound. Usually.

18:40.822 --> 18:43.657
Coolest? That's nifty.

18:43.690 --> 18:45.126
Look, they're not infallible.

18:45.159 --> 18:47.527
And if Hitler found
any sort of weakness,

18:47.561 --> 18:49.663
it will be the end of the world
as we know it.

20:30.131 --> 20:34.035
We've used the giant bird
excuse twice in the last month.

20:34.068 --> 20:36.070
I don't think we'll
get away with it a third time.

20:36.103 --> 20:37.972
Let's not push our luck.

20:38.005 --> 20:41.809
Just refer to Carter's attack
as an experimental prototype.

20:41.842 --> 20:43.778
Be sure to give the soldiers
all the credit.

20:45.012 --> 20:46.579
They protected the citizens.

20:48.249 --> 20:51.218
Without them, we wouldn't have
been able to focus.

20:52.086 --> 20:53.988
Makes my job easy.

20:54.021 --> 20:55.756
And what do I write
about this guy?

20:59.659 --> 21:00.660
Nothing, as usual.

21:01.829 --> 21:03.530
We don't even know your name.

21:04.765 --> 21:08.501
Oh. Uh... I'm Flash.

21:08.535 --> 21:10.603
Well, we've already got
one of those.

21:13.140 --> 21:14.742
How about Future Boy?

21:17.278 --> 21:19.013
That will work for now.

21:19.046 --> 21:21.749
Future Boy,
this is Shakespeare,

21:21.782 --> 21:22.950
our war correspondent.

21:29.123 --> 21:30.157
Do I know you?

21:35.062 --> 21:37.932
Princess,
I've waited long enough.

21:39.834 --> 21:40.935
Is this happening?

21:42.770 --> 21:44.972
This is happening.

21:45.006 --> 21:46.606
I can't
hold this in anymore.

21:48.876 --> 21:49.810
Will you marry me?

21:55.249 --> 21:56.649
Good attempt, Trevor.

22:01.088 --> 22:04.091
He upped his game.
Flowers.

22:04.125 --> 22:06.526
If he doesn't quit soon,
I'll lose my bet.

22:10.831 --> 22:13.666
Wait... what was that about?

22:13.700 --> 22:17.038
He proposes every day,
and every day she says "no."

22:18.671 --> 22:20.041
Didn't take you for a stalker.

22:20.074 --> 22:22.943
Stalker? Is...
You mean like a cad? A wolf?

22:22.977 --> 22:24.879
No, no. It's...
it's nothing like that. I...

22:26.047 --> 22:28.681
If it really bothered her, I...

22:28.716 --> 22:32.353
She promised one day
she'd say yes.

22:32.386 --> 22:34.621
When... when it was
the right time, of course.

22:34.654 --> 22:36.223
And that...

22:36.257 --> 22:38.259
Well, that makes
every other day just worth it.

22:39.994 --> 22:40.928
Thank you, soldier.

22:44.899 --> 22:47.101
Extraction's here.

22:47.134 --> 22:50.838
Of course, you know, if she ever does
say yes, I might drop dead from shock.

22:55.709 --> 22:57.278
<i>We said we would end this war.</i>

22:58.779 --> 23:01.082
It's been two years.

23:01.115 --> 23:03.384
That's not our call, Diana.

23:03.417 --> 23:05.119
Too many people
have died already.

23:05.152 --> 23:06.987
We can stop this.

23:09.423 --> 23:11.225
Oh my goodness.
Please, take a seat.

23:12.927 --> 23:16.063
You want to stop this?
Future Boy could stop It.

23:16.097 --> 23:18.332
That's not a good idea, Dinah.

23:18.365 --> 23:20.868
We can't use the future
to change the past.

23:20.901 --> 23:22.803
It would create a paradox

23:22.837 --> 23:25.840
and this Flash won't be able to
return to his own time period.

23:25.873 --> 23:27.741
Or this could be
how it happens.

23:27.775 --> 23:29.810
That much I knew.
See, there's this movie...

23:29.844 --> 23:32.213
Paradox. Unable to go home.

23:33.848 --> 23:35.382
Right. Shutting up.

23:35.416 --> 23:36.917
Dinah's right.

23:36.951 --> 23:40.154
We need to utilize
every meta-human we can.

23:40.187 --> 23:42.423
We can't keep putting civilians
in danger.

23:42.456 --> 23:44.325
Well, I suppose
those of us without power

23:44.358 --> 23:45.860
are just chopped liver?

23:47.228 --> 23:49.196
So, we're just supposed
to let people die?

23:49.230 --> 23:50.931
Oh, we can handle ourselves,
your Highness.

23:50.965 --> 23:51.932
Don't worry about us.

23:53.767 --> 23:54.802
Oh, I get that the rest

23:54.835 --> 23:55.936
of the gang have powers...

23:57.037 --> 23:59.306
War is a place for warriors.

23:59.340 --> 24:00.640
Not a place for wishes.

24:02.409 --> 24:04.912
Well, everybody's gotta die
some time, Princess.

24:06.180 --> 24:07.348
I won't.

24:09.183 --> 24:11.385
Look, it's gonna take everyone
to get off the sidelines

24:11.418 --> 24:13.686
and onto the field
to win this war.

24:13.721 --> 24:15.389
And if I die,

24:15.422 --> 24:17.690
at least it'll be
for something I believe in.

24:23.330 --> 24:24.431
Are they always like this?

24:24.465 --> 24:26.400
Like a broken record, son.

24:26.433 --> 24:27.902
You've got
a new mission.

24:29.937 --> 24:31.705
We can't decode the intel.

24:32.840 --> 24:35.075
So, that fight was what? A gas?

24:35.109 --> 24:38.312
What exactly was
this intel supposed to be for?

24:38.345 --> 24:40.781
The Germans are looking for
a new artifact.

24:40.814 --> 24:42.283
They're saying
it's a game changer.

24:42.316 --> 24:45.920
If we can't read the code,
then what's the mission?

24:45.953 --> 24:47.855
Now, I have a lead
on some help.

24:47.888 --> 24:49.857
A man with mystical abilities.

24:49.890 --> 24:51.792
They pulled him
out of their camps

24:51.825 --> 24:53.827
and stuck him in a securely
guarded castle in Bavaria.

24:53.861 --> 24:56.397
They say he can break any code.

24:56.430 --> 24:59.233
Problem is... he's insane.

25:00.301 --> 25:01.802
Insane?

25:01.835 --> 25:04.939
And what are we
going to do about him?

25:04.972 --> 25:06.440
What do our scientists think?

25:07.441 --> 25:09.076
The best course of action...

25:09.109 --> 25:11.278
After narrowing in
on the potential outcomes...

25:11.312 --> 25:13.347
Not to mention
the quantum physics,

25:13.380 --> 25:16.283
which is really something
that should be studied here...

25:16.317 --> 25:17.985
To the point, gentlemen.

25:18.018 --> 25:21.855
He should stick with us.
For research.

25:21.889 --> 25:24.458
Then, Future Boy...

25:24.491 --> 25:25.926
welcome to the team.

26:14.541 --> 26:16.143
We should slip in
without notice.

26:17.211 --> 26:18.979
You've seen your wings, right?

26:19.013 --> 26:20.948
This place is a fortress.

26:20.981 --> 26:23.517
We won't be able
to take it by stealth.

26:23.550 --> 26:25.452
Stick to the plan.
You all know what to do.

26:25.486 --> 26:27.421
Jay and Rex worked these out.

26:27.454 --> 26:29.523
They're for communication.

26:29.556 --> 26:32.126
When you have a message,
tap the earpiece in Morse code

26:32.159 --> 26:34.828
and the message will be
received in our own ear pieces.

26:34.862 --> 26:36.563
Oh, do I get one?

26:36.597 --> 26:39.033
No. You're with me, Future Boy.

26:40.134 --> 26:41.135
Let's move out.

27:01.021 --> 27:02.556
Shouldn't we have attempted
to be more...

27:02.589 --> 27:03.957
I don't know, stealth?

27:05.192 --> 27:06.860
Carter worries too much.

27:08.228 --> 27:10.831
You're very... upfront.

27:12.399 --> 27:15.235
Like Steve said,
we all die sooner or later.

27:19.173 --> 27:21.375
What? It is a joke.

27:23.110 --> 27:25.446
No it isn't. Not to Steve.

27:27.147 --> 27:28.048
He thinks it's as simple

27:28.082 --> 27:29.483
as asking a question.

27:29.516 --> 27:30.651
He doesn't realize

27:30.684 --> 27:32.353
what he asks.

27:35.022 --> 27:36.223
That sounded...

27:36.256 --> 27:37.157
Bad.

27:39.159 --> 27:40.194
It's Steve.

27:40.227 --> 27:41.595
He needs us to see something.

27:42.496 --> 27:45.099
Now.

27:45.132 --> 27:48.202
Can't you just zip in, take out
their guns and zip out?

27:48.235 --> 27:50.471
- I could, but...
- But what?

27:52.139 --> 27:53.107
Well...

27:55.409 --> 27:56.944
my powers
haven't been acting right

27:56.977 --> 27:58.379
since the other Flash arrived.

27:58.412 --> 28:01.448
Of course.
Why is it always us?

28:01.482 --> 28:03.917
Don't belly ache.
It's not always us.

28:04.651 --> 28:06.320
It's just mostly us.

28:08.422 --> 28:10.324
I should take a swig
of the Miraclo.

28:10.357 --> 28:11.358
You can't.

28:11.392 --> 28:13.460
It's not been 24 hours yet.

28:13.494 --> 28:15.629
I'm no use to you like this.

28:15.662 --> 28:16.997
We're running out of options.

28:19.533 --> 28:22.236
If this goes haywire,
blame the new guy.

28:42.757 --> 28:45.058
Who says an old dog
can't learn new tricks.

28:47.661 --> 28:50.330
This is not what I had in mind

28:50.364 --> 28:53.033
when I joined
an elite fighting force.

28:53.066 --> 28:55.569
But you've got so much
experience digging through dirt.

29:01.743 --> 29:02.710
You all right?

29:06.113 --> 29:07.681
Regular good-time Charley.

29:11.719 --> 29:13.554
You've been hard
on Future Boy.

29:15.122 --> 29:16.390
It's just he...

29:16.423 --> 29:18.592
he doesn't know
anything about us.

29:22.629 --> 29:24.131
We're supposed to be
a secret.

29:26.166 --> 29:28.068
No, I know, but...

29:29.136 --> 29:30.103
But what?

29:31.706 --> 29:34.007
What's the point of all this

29:34.041 --> 29:36.043
if we aren't even remembered?

29:36.076 --> 29:38.479
We fight, we die.

29:40.113 --> 29:41.448
Death probably isn't scary

29:41.482 --> 29:43.350
when you have someone
waiting for you.

29:45.586 --> 29:47.521
And what about the nice
detective back home?

29:49.256 --> 29:50.657
Larry?

29:50.691 --> 29:54.495
I don't really think
he's the one. You know?

29:57.832 --> 30:00.802
Listen, I know
things seem dire,

30:00.835 --> 30:02.804
but one day
this will all be over

30:02.837 --> 30:04.739
and we will all need
to live again.

30:06.206 --> 30:08.542
For me it's finding
that other half

30:08.575 --> 30:09.777
that I look forward to.

30:25.860 --> 30:27.327
That's, uh...

30:27.361 --> 30:29.329
That's not what
I think it's for, is it?

30:35.168 --> 30:36.503
Shakespeare is looking.

30:37.571 --> 30:38.472
Diana...

30:39.506 --> 30:40.607
I didn't know.

30:42.810 --> 30:44.278
Let's go help.

30:55.422 --> 30:57.524
Two corridors left.
I'm checking now.

31:40.300 --> 31:42.603
It's... you.

31:42.636 --> 31:44.137
He said you would come.

31:44.906 --> 31:46.239
And here you are.

31:47.240 --> 31:48.843
This is yours.

31:48.876 --> 31:51.511
I'm supposed
to give this to you.

31:51.545 --> 31:53.380
What are you
talking about, kid?

31:53.413 --> 31:55.215
Take it. Use it.

31:56.818 --> 31:58.886
You have to make sure
it never happens.

32:02.724 --> 32:05.258
I'm sure that's why
I'm back here now.

32:05.292 --> 32:06.526
He said you'd know
what to do.

32:08.261 --> 32:09.529
Who said?

32:09.563 --> 32:10.430
Halt!

32:37.224 --> 32:38.291
How's it going?

32:47.835 --> 32:48.870
Should we tell?

32:51.538 --> 32:54.408
Yes. Yes, they should know.
They should know.

33:01.548 --> 33:03.350
No. It...

33:04.251 --> 33:05.853
it can't be.

33:08.422 --> 33:09.589
Do you know this guy?

33:17.698 --> 33:19.366
I know him
from a previous life.

33:20.267 --> 33:21.836
Is this...

33:21.869 --> 33:23.705
He's the code breaker?

33:23.738 --> 33:25.807
He wasn't like this before.

33:25.840 --> 33:27.474
Well, make him snap out of it.

33:27.507 --> 33:29.744
- We're not equipped to handle...
- Dead.

33:29.777 --> 33:33.280
They're all going to be dead.

33:33.313 --> 33:35.717
They need to know.
They should know.

33:37.051 --> 33:38.552
Jay, do you have the code?

33:44.357 --> 33:46.660
We need your help, my friend.

33:46.693 --> 33:47.995
Can you translate this?

34:03.945 --> 34:05.880
Well, that was anti-climactic.

34:31.571 --> 34:34.508
Shakespeare,
the bullet hit you dead on.

34:37.111 --> 34:39.446
Steve, release these captives.

34:43.450 --> 34:45.887
You keep calling me
Shakespeare, but it's...

34:47.487 --> 34:48.756
It's Clark.

34:49.656 --> 34:50.690
It's Clark Kent.

34:52.392 --> 34:54.796
Well, you... you're Superman.

34:54.829 --> 34:56.429
It's me, Flash.

34:56.463 --> 34:57.765
How did you get here?

34:57.799 --> 34:59.366
Did you follow me
through that time warp?

34:59.399 --> 35:01.468
Is this a rescue?
Why do you have a mustache?

35:01.501 --> 35:04.604
Stuck? What are you
talking about?

35:04.638 --> 35:07.607
You...
You're Superman.

35:07.641 --> 35:10.510
You fight for truth, justice.
You save people.

35:12.379 --> 35:14.916
I don't even know how
to wrap my head around this.

35:14.949 --> 35:17.852
You are invincible?

35:17.885 --> 35:19.754
I'm a little tough-skinned,
that's all.

35:25.692 --> 35:27.795
If you stand by
and do nothing...

35:29.163 --> 35:31.364
you are as bad as the Nazis.

35:32.632 --> 35:33.567
You're wrong.

35:35.736 --> 35:38.072
Then why are you here?

35:38.105 --> 35:41.508
- To get this story.
- But you...

35:41.541 --> 35:43.510
You're one of the most
selfless people I know.

35:44.644 --> 35:45.813
I don't know you.

35:46.848 --> 35:48.149
In my time on this planet,

35:48.182 --> 35:49.951
I learned you look out
for yourself.

35:52.586 --> 35:53.587
This planet?

35:54.688 --> 35:56.456
But in my time...

35:56.489 --> 35:58.059
Something's different.

35:58.092 --> 35:59.392
What about your parents?

36:01.595 --> 36:04.564
Martha and Jonathan Kent
died in an accident

36:04.598 --> 36:06.466
when I was three-years-old.

36:06.499 --> 36:08.135
I was sent to an orphanage.

36:13.140 --> 36:15.508
I'm going to make sure the
captives get out of the building.

36:17.011 --> 36:18.145
Does that make me complicit?

36:24.085 --> 36:25.052
Wait, this...

36:25.086 --> 36:26.153
I'm not...

36:26.187 --> 36:27.088
This isn't...

36:27.121 --> 36:28.155
Are you all right?

36:29.123 --> 36:30.758
I'm not in the past.

36:30.791 --> 36:32.093
This isn't a different time.

36:33.995 --> 36:35.528
What are you talking about?

36:36.964 --> 36:37.932
This is...

36:37.965 --> 36:39.033
this is a different Earth.

36:40.101 --> 36:41.501
I have to find Jay.

36:53.714 --> 36:55.548
Was he always able to do this?

36:55.582 --> 36:57.919
This... and so much more.

37:06.060 --> 37:08.729
- These are...
- Coordinates.

37:08.763 --> 37:10.831
For where?

37:10.865 --> 37:13.901
- It looks like...
- The Bermuda Triangle.

37:18.005 --> 37:21.008
No, he's not ready yet.

37:21.042 --> 37:23.044
Yes, he's received
the package,

37:23.077 --> 37:24.946
but he doesn't know
what it means.

37:38.558 --> 37:39.592
It's you.

37:41.028 --> 37:43.264
I saw you when I traveled here.

37:43.297 --> 37:45.866
Please, do you know a way
for me to get back home?

37:45.900 --> 37:47.500
Back to my universe?

37:47.534 --> 37:49.203
Your universe?

37:49.236 --> 37:52.773
But this would be Earth 1,
the real Earth.

37:52.807 --> 37:54.742
This is the multiverse theory.

37:54.775 --> 37:56.844
You're not
making this up, right?

37:58.913 --> 38:01.015
You may return,

38:01.048 --> 38:04.151
but you have another task
ahead of you

38:04.185 --> 38:08.155
and a lesson you must learn.

38:08.189 --> 38:09.622
Only then can you...

38:09.656 --> 38:11.892
No, I won't tell him
about the League.

38:14.996 --> 38:17.164
You will see her again soon.

38:21.701 --> 38:22.803
And...

38:24.138 --> 38:25.505
You should go.

38:26.673 --> 38:27.708
It's starting.

38:46.160 --> 38:48.329
Sounds like
this guy's gone cockeyed.

38:48.362 --> 38:50.064
Maybe.

38:50.097 --> 38:52.833
But Hitler worked hard
to keep this place a secret.

38:52.867 --> 38:53.901
Where's Shakespeare?

38:54.935 --> 38:57.537
He's on his own.

38:58.638 --> 39:00.041
What are the coordinates for?

39:01.375 --> 39:03.310
The Bermuda Triangle.

39:03.344 --> 39:06.947
But it's... it's a legend.

39:08.615 --> 39:11.285
So are we. Got anything
for us, Future Boy?

39:11.318 --> 39:13.154
We're not in my world.

39:13.187 --> 39:15.022
This isn't my past.
I don't...

39:15.056 --> 39:16.157
I don't know where to start.

39:18.159 --> 39:20.861
Steve, can you get us a ship?

39:20.895 --> 39:22.329
I'll do you one better,
Princess.

39:41.248 --> 39:43.851
Just try it on.
See if it fits.

39:45.685 --> 39:47.721
- You're relentless.
- That's why you love me.

39:52.259 --> 39:53.794
Two. Maybe three.

39:55.429 --> 39:57.364
Down bubble, five degrees.

39:57.398 --> 39:59.366
Slow propeller by 50%.

40:03.270 --> 40:04.405
Contact?

40:04.438 --> 40:06.639
Two, maybe three ships
above us.

40:06.673 --> 40:07.875
Do they know we're here?

40:08.843 --> 40:10.277
We're about to find out.

40:26.693 --> 40:29.230
Ooh, is it hot in here,
or is it just me?

40:31.098 --> 40:32.665
Splashes.

40:32.699 --> 40:35.736
Down bubble, full speed.
Right rudder, 15 degrees.

40:35.769 --> 40:37.071
Right rudder, 15 degrees.

40:56.323 --> 40:58.392
- Report!
- Leaks toward aft.

40:58.425 --> 40:59.727
Engine room is flooding.

41:01.262 --> 41:03.731
Where your tools,
and how do you fix leaks?

41:19.813 --> 41:22.950
Ooh! And Iris says
I'm not handy.

41:35.095 --> 41:36.463
What's happening?

41:36.497 --> 41:37.898
The depth charges have
knocked out our engines.

41:37.932 --> 41:39.400
We have to surface.

41:39.433 --> 41:41.168
If we surface, we're dead.

41:41.202 --> 41:43.437
Is there any way
to restart the engines?

41:43.470 --> 41:45.940
You have an extra
20 batteries lying around?

41:45.973 --> 41:48.275
No. But I have
the next best thing.

41:52.446 --> 41:53.314
Give me a hand.

41:57.384 --> 41:59.486
There she is. What now?

41:59.520 --> 42:01.488
We build up enough electricity
to jump start her.

42:13.467 --> 42:14.868
Well, I'll be...

42:17.538 --> 42:19.306
What the hell are you doing?

42:19.340 --> 42:20.341
Going out there.

42:22.543 --> 42:24.912
Look this behind me
and flood the tube.

42:27.881 --> 42:28.782
Steve?

42:32.553 --> 42:35.356
You are just so beautiful

42:35.389 --> 42:38.158
when you're about to kick
some Nazi tail.

42:38.192 --> 42:40.394
You know, there is a captain
on board.

42:40.427 --> 42:42.496
Let me make an honest
Amazon out of you.

42:45.332 --> 42:46.533
See you when I get back.

42:49.203 --> 42:51.272
Someone's flooded Tube 1.

42:51.305 --> 42:53.073
Did you order
a torpedo launch?

42:53.107 --> 42:54.808
No

42:56.277 --> 42:57.211
Then what is it?

42:58.012 --> 42:58.979
One guess.

43:24.638 --> 43:26.140
Sir, depth charges...
They're...

43:26.607 --> 43:27.474
going up.

44:54.695 --> 44:56.029
You okay?

44:56.063 --> 45:00.501
Yes, we had... help.

45:00.534 --> 45:02.035
What kind of help?

45:02.069 --> 45:04.571
Some sort of... aqua men.

45:45.780 --> 45:48.482
Greetings, surface dwellers.

45:48.515 --> 45:51.151
On behalf of our king,
we welcome you.

45:53.520 --> 45:54.588
What is this place?

45:55.589 --> 45:57.057
An outpost.

45:57.090 --> 45:58.225
A place where the people

45:58.258 --> 46:00.227
of Atlantis can stay informed

46:00.260 --> 46:02.129
about the irrational behavior

46:02.162 --> 46:03.564
of the monkeys above us.

46:05.032 --> 46:06.667
Rude.

46:06.700 --> 46:09.536
Come. Our king
would like a word.

46:28.489 --> 46:32.359
My King, here are the ones
that repelled the boats.

46:37.498 --> 46:38.398
Welcome.

46:40.467 --> 46:42.169
I am Arthur,

46:42.202 --> 46:45.105
ruler of Atlantis and all of
the oceans of this world.

46:45.138 --> 46:46.640
What brings you to my kingdom?

46:46.673 --> 46:50.344
Your Highness, I am Diana,

46:50.377 --> 46:52.312
Princess of Themyscira.

46:53.614 --> 46:54.615
I know of your island.

46:56.183 --> 46:58.385
I'm sorry for your loss.

46:58.418 --> 47:01.388
Thank you, but what happened
there could happen

47:01.421 --> 47:04.291
to the rest of the surface
world without your help.

47:06.493 --> 47:07.628
The boundaries of my kingdom

47:07.661 --> 47:08.629
far exceeds those

47:08.662 --> 47:09.663
on the surface and demand

47:09.696 --> 47:11.164
my undivided attention.

47:12.132 --> 47:13.534
Tell me,

47:13.567 --> 47:14.668
why should I care about

47:14.701 --> 47:16.738
the affairs of those above?

47:16.771 --> 47:18.706
Because these Nazis
will not stop

47:18.740 --> 47:21.041
until the whole world
is theirs.

47:22.175 --> 47:24.746
Above and below.

47:24.779 --> 47:28.816
Yes, the blood of air breathers
does run hot.

47:28.850 --> 47:30.785
I think you speak true,
daughter of a Hippolyta.

47:31.652 --> 47:33.687
I will help you.

47:33.721 --> 47:36.390
Sire...

47:37.792 --> 47:39.693
Come. There is something I have

47:39.727 --> 47:41.461
that might turn the tide
in your favor.

47:45.165 --> 47:47.534
Hm. The king of Atlantis
made a pun.

47:53.908 --> 47:55.642
Please, in here.

48:01.214 --> 48:02.516
I see nothing.

48:02.549 --> 48:03.517
Quite.

48:09.590 --> 48:13.327
I'm afraid Atlantean magic
is quite powerful.

48:13.360 --> 48:16.496
There's no use
in trying to escape.

48:16.530 --> 48:19.767
Maybe he would have if you had
gotten here sooner.

48:20.701 --> 48:22.235
But now...

48:22.269 --> 48:23.136
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

48:28.542 --> 48:32.145
Once upon a time,
a modern day pirate

48:32.179 --> 48:35.649
smuggling, traversing the ocean
to make my fortune

48:35.682 --> 48:39.252
and then,
a storm destroyed my ship

48:39.286 --> 48:41.723
and the Atlanteans saved me.

48:41.756 --> 48:42.924
Little did they know

48:42.957 --> 48:45.192
that my particular talents

48:45.225 --> 48:46.560
would grant me control

48:46.593 --> 48:47.694
of their king.

48:47.729 --> 48:49.596
So you're human like us?

48:49.630 --> 48:51.565
Then why side with the Nazis?

48:51.598 --> 48:53.567
Don't you know
what they're doing up there?

48:53.600 --> 48:55.636
Of course, I do.

48:55.669 --> 48:58.672
It always pays
to be on the winning side.

48:58.706 --> 49:03.778
And with the Allies superpower
team off the table...

49:03.811 --> 49:07.614
Honestly, I'm surprised
you took the bait.

49:08.649 --> 49:10.350
The codes.

49:10.384 --> 49:11.819
You set us up.

49:11.853 --> 49:15.589
Obviously. The war
is all but over.

49:15.622 --> 49:17.491
And you have lost.

49:17.524 --> 49:20.762
Enjoy the solitude
of this prison

49:20.795 --> 49:22.797
because when we return...

49:28.368 --> 49:32.639
No. Wait.
Why did I imprison those people?

49:32.673 --> 49:34.374
They seemed upright...

49:34.408 --> 49:35.542
True.

49:35.575 --> 49:38.980
Because they are
the enemy, Sire.

49:39.013 --> 49:42.884
They want to rule your kingdom,
pollute your water,

49:42.917 --> 49:45.285
enslave your children.

49:46.353 --> 49:49.256
Enslave? No.

49:49.289 --> 49:52.794
We must help these Germans
win their war,

49:52.827 --> 49:56.296
and then,
when both sides are weak,

49:57.364 --> 49:59.332
we'll destroy them all.

50:00.267 --> 50:01.334
Yes?

50:02.636 --> 50:03.705
Yes.

50:05.672 --> 50:08.675
It's time to show those above
what true power looks like.

50:19.754 --> 50:21.823
Give it a rest, will you?

50:23.725 --> 50:25.392
We need a plan.

50:25.425 --> 50:27.427
I think Red over there
is working on it.

50:31.598 --> 50:33.901
- You okay?
- What? Yeah, yeah.

50:33.935 --> 50:36.369
I'm just...
Ever since I've arrived,

50:36.403 --> 50:38.638
I've been less.

50:38.672 --> 50:39.807
Maybe I've lost some energy

50:39.841 --> 50:41.042
from overextending myself

50:41.075 --> 50:42.409
by getting
to this world, but...

50:43.010 --> 50:44.611
The Speed Force.

50:44.644 --> 50:46.279
What's the Speed Force?

50:46.313 --> 50:49.316
Well, it's just
a working theory,

50:49.349 --> 50:51.551
but it's a little like
photosynthesis.

50:51.585 --> 50:54.321
You know, the way plants
convert sunlight into energy?

50:54.354 --> 50:56.023
Imagine the Speed Force
is the sun,

50:56.057 --> 50:57.691
and we draw energy from it,

50:57.725 --> 51:00.327
converting it into
our speed abilities.

51:00.360 --> 51:03.064
I've been having
the same problem.

51:03.097 --> 51:04.866
If both of us are drawing
from the Speed Force

51:04.899 --> 51:06.000
at the same time...

51:06.033 --> 51:07.735
We'll be less powerful.

51:07.769 --> 51:10.303
Although if we could somehow
combine our energy...

51:10.337 --> 51:11.939
We might regain full power.

51:11.973 --> 51:14.574
How will that bypass magic?

51:14.608 --> 51:16.443
Physics are universal, Diana.

51:16.476 --> 51:19.412
When I was younger, I could
vibrate between molecules

51:19.446 --> 51:21.716
phasing through solid objects.

51:21.749 --> 51:22.984
Have you ever done that?

51:23.017 --> 51:25.318
Seriously? You can do that?

51:25.352 --> 51:27.855
What the heck have
I been doing all these years?

51:27.889 --> 51:29.957
All right.
Hands on the floor.

51:29.991 --> 51:32.626
Start vibrating.
You'll feel it when it's close.

51:32.659 --> 51:33.593
I'll try to help.

51:55.515 --> 51:57.084
Keep going!

52:00.387 --> 52:02.957
Oh,
I can't believe that worked.

52:08.395 --> 52:09.797
Seize him!

52:12.465 --> 52:13.901
Where did your king go?

52:13.935 --> 52:16.436
I will tell you nothing,
mouth-breathing, finless...

52:19.941 --> 52:20.908
I yield.

52:27.614 --> 52:29.683
- You made it.
- Thanks to Jay.

52:30.517 --> 52:31.585
Stand back.

52:40.728 --> 52:42.763
We have to get
to the surface.

52:42.797 --> 52:45.398
Warn the Allies
of the Atlanteans involvement.

52:45.432 --> 52:46.968
No, there's no time.

52:47.001 --> 52:48.970
It turns out the Atlanteans
and Nazis are launching

52:49.003 --> 52:52.139
a surprise attack against
the Eastern Seaboard of the US.

52:52.173 --> 52:53.573
Then we stop them.

52:54.541 --> 52:56.110
Yes, but that's not all.

52:56.143 --> 52:58.678
One of the guards
said that King Aqua... Man

52:58.713 --> 53:00.513
is headed down to the trench.

53:00.547 --> 53:01.849
Someplace nearby.

53:01.883 --> 53:03.751
He's going to unlock
some sort of cage.

53:03.784 --> 53:06.120
So... what's in the cage?

53:07.054 --> 53:08.488
I have no idea,

53:08.521 --> 53:10.157
but it can't be good.

53:10.191 --> 53:12.459
Right. You're coming with me

53:12.492 --> 53:14.729
to stop him from opening...
whatever.

53:14.762 --> 53:17.098
- And the rest of us?
- Take the submarine.

53:17.131 --> 53:18.598
You have to beat them there.

53:20.600 --> 53:22.069
Be careful.

53:22.103 --> 53:23.470
I'm always careful.

53:24.638 --> 53:26.107
We both know that's not true.

53:39.686 --> 53:41.488
I think I found them.
Dead ahead.

53:48.195 --> 53:49.462
What does this do?

53:50.697 --> 53:52.800
Oh!

53:52.833 --> 53:55.836
Atlantean pressure suit.
Cool.

54:08.883 --> 54:11.218
We were getting worried.

54:11.953 --> 54:13.154
So were we.

54:13.187 --> 54:14.755
Captain, I need you
and the boys

54:14.789 --> 54:16.724
to get us to New York
as soon as possible.

54:16.757 --> 54:18.192
It would be my pleasure.

54:18.225 --> 54:20.094
You heard the man.
Let's move.

54:20.127 --> 54:22.763
Take us out of this hell hole.
Full speed.

54:29.203 --> 54:30.670
They've got quite a lead.

54:30.705 --> 54:32.039
There's no way
we can beat him there.

54:32.073 --> 54:33.673
We have to try.

54:33.708 --> 54:34.976
Jay, how are you feeling?

54:35.943 --> 54:37.644
Ship shape.

54:37.677 --> 54:39.180
Are you up for supercharging
those batteries again?

54:39.213 --> 54:41.182
I have to be. This is war.

55:00.334 --> 55:02.737
Now, Your Highness,

55:02.770 --> 55:06.073
use your trident
to focus your call.

55:06.107 --> 55:08.575
Unlock the gate.

55:08.608 --> 55:11.979
Bring the creatures.
Seal our victory.

55:25.592 --> 55:27.028
Yes!

55:48.182 --> 55:49.316
My.

55:49.350 --> 55:50.885
You're a strong one.

55:51.752 --> 55:53.220
Don't worry.

55:53.254 --> 55:55.256
You'll get
your fill of violence.

56:13.074 --> 56:14.607
Something is wrong.

56:14.641 --> 56:15.976
Ah. My head.

57:12.266 --> 57:13.400
Ah...

57:14.101 --> 57:15.035
Good.

57:57.211 --> 57:58.412
What's... that?

58:37.218 --> 58:38.118
Oh, God!

59:04.278 --> 59:05.546
Hey, fish lips.

59:05.579 --> 59:07.147
How about a real fight?

59:38.345 --> 59:40.047
Keep it up, gents.

59:48.555 --> 59:50.057
Master race, my rear.

59:58.532 --> 1:00:00.034
Shake your tail, Canary.

1:00:08.642 --> 1:00:11.478
Join the army. Fight Nazis.

1:00:11.512 --> 1:00:13.280
Fall in love
with an Amazonian princess

1:00:13.314 --> 1:00:17.151
and end up in an Atlantean tank
taking on bad guys.

1:00:17.184 --> 1:00:20.087
Steve Trevor, never complain
about being bored again.

1:00:37.538 --> 1:00:39.340
Send these fish
back to the sea.

1:01:00.294 --> 1:01:01.495
Sh...

1:01:15.442 --> 1:01:16.677
- Over there.
- Do you see it?

1:01:16.711 --> 1:01:18.345
- Look.
- Is that...

1:01:32.960 --> 1:01:37.030
They're going to destroy
your home, my King.

1:01:37.064 --> 1:01:40.267
It's best
to destroy theirs first.

1:01:53.080 --> 1:01:54.281
Hawkman, civilians.

1:02:16.036 --> 1:02:18.071
I'm never eating seafood again.

1:02:18.105 --> 1:02:20.641
I don't know.
I bet it tastes fine in butter.

1:02:20.674 --> 1:02:22.643
Canary and I will
get the big guy.

1:02:22.676 --> 1:02:24.545
The rest of you stop those...

1:02:24.578 --> 1:02:26.413
things from getting
to the city.

1:02:26.447 --> 1:02:28.315
Let's give them hell, boys.

1:02:28.348 --> 1:02:29.349
After you.

1:02:29.383 --> 1:02:30.584
How gentlemanly of you.

1:03:38.552 --> 1:03:39.721
No, no, no.

1:03:41.088 --> 1:03:42.356
It's okay.

1:03:42.389 --> 1:03:43.390
You're going to be okay.

1:03:45.492 --> 1:03:46.693
You're a terrible liar.

1:03:48.362 --> 1:03:50.163
Stay with me, Carter. You...

1:03:51.532 --> 1:03:52.699
You can't.

1:03:54.434 --> 1:03:55.569
You can't go.

1:03:59.640 --> 1:04:00.541
I'm not leaving.

1:04:02.509 --> 1:04:03.377
Not forever.

1:04:05.713 --> 1:04:07.314
Listen, little bird.

1:04:08.515 --> 1:04:09.683
You spend so much time

1:04:09.717 --> 1:04:10.584
building walls,

1:04:12.119 --> 1:04:13.554
keeping people out,

1:04:13.587 --> 1:04:16.390
and I know
you've been hurt before, but...

1:04:16.423 --> 1:04:17.658
you have to
promise me something.

1:04:19.226 --> 1:04:21.061
Promise me you won't
give up on this.

1:04:22.362 --> 1:04:23.230
On life.

1:04:25.299 --> 1:04:26.166
On love.

1:04:28.836 --> 1:04:30.437
Remember.

1:04:30.470 --> 1:04:31.405
It's the only thing

1:04:32.306 --> 1:04:33.273
worth living for.

1:04:36.343 --> 1:04:37.210
Carter.

1:04:38.445 --> 1:04:39.313
Please.

1:04:40.247 --> 1:04:41.248
Please.

1:04:41.749 --> 1:04:42.616
Chay-Ara.

1:04:43.818 --> 1:04:44.685
I'm coming.

1:04:47.421 --> 1:04:48.790
I'm...

1:06:23.550 --> 1:06:24.618
Okay.

1:06:24.651 --> 1:06:25.720
So I guess the big one is mine.

1:07:04.691 --> 1:07:05.727
Surrender.

1:07:09.831 --> 1:07:10.765
Sorry.

1:07:10.798 --> 1:07:12.365
I'm an American.

1:07:12.399 --> 1:07:13.467
We don't do surrender.

1:07:29.884 --> 1:07:30.752
You okay?

1:07:31.551 --> 1:07:33.286
Yeah, I think so.

1:07:36.858 --> 1:07:39.359
Told everyone I wasn't much use

1:07:39.392 --> 1:07:40.762
without...

1:07:40.795 --> 1:07:42.295
And stay still. Here.
Put pressure on it.

1:08:34.749 --> 1:08:36.918
Steve, what are you doing?

1:08:36.951 --> 1:08:37.919
Whatever I can.

1:08:54.902 --> 1:08:56.536
Yeah. That was me.

1:09:07.114 --> 1:09:08.648
You call that a scream?

1:09:46.721 --> 1:09:47.587
Perfect.

1:09:55.830 --> 1:09:57.899
You know? I gotta admit.

1:09:57.932 --> 1:09:59.532
You're pretty tough

1:09:59.566 --> 1:10:00.433
on the outside.

1:10:31.933 --> 1:10:32.900
Steve?

1:10:32.934 --> 1:10:34.135
You okay?

1:10:34.168 --> 1:10:35.468
Yeah.

1:10:37.104 --> 1:10:38.139
Just need a minute.

1:10:39.040 --> 1:10:40.473
Take your time.

1:10:40.507 --> 1:10:41.175
I got this covered.

1:10:49.582 --> 1:10:50.450
Who dares?

1:10:53.653 --> 1:10:54.789
Steve Trevor.

1:10:54.822 --> 1:10:56.857
Colonel in the US Army,

1:10:56.891 --> 1:10:58.025
Wonder Woman's boyfriend.

1:11:06.767 --> 1:11:08.002
I admire your bravery.

1:11:09.569 --> 1:11:11.939
But your fate
will be like the rest.

1:11:11.973 --> 1:11:14.241
You have no business
fighting with gods.

1:11:21.581 --> 1:11:22.917
But I do.

1:11:28.655 --> 1:11:29.824
Enough of this.

1:11:33.094 --> 1:11:35.595
You will not win today
or any day.

1:11:36.931 --> 1:11:39.800
The hearts of humanity
yearn for freedom

1:11:41.068 --> 1:11:42.970
and I aim to help them
achieve it.

1:11:44.839 --> 1:11:46.007
Then you are a fool.

1:11:56.183 --> 1:11:59.153
I said enough.

1:12:33.287 --> 1:12:34.155
What have I done?

1:13:06.387 --> 1:13:08.355
Oh, what just happened?

1:13:08.389 --> 1:13:10.825
And good riddance.

1:13:10.858 --> 1:13:14.261
You think this means
you've won?

1:13:14.295 --> 1:13:19.266
You and your league
can't stop the <i>Fuhrer's</i> reign.

1:13:19.300 --> 1:13:20.768
Can't you hear it?

1:13:20.801 --> 1:13:22.770
The sound of defeat.

1:13:22.803 --> 1:13:25.306
The sound of failure.

1:13:35.816 --> 1:13:38.786
No. No. What did you...

1:13:43.157 --> 1:13:46.093
Ah, I won.

1:13:46.127 --> 1:13:48.329
I always win.

1:14:02.810 --> 1:14:04.712
Steve, you okay?

1:14:04.745 --> 1:14:05.412
I'll be fine.

1:14:11.785 --> 1:14:12.652
Go.

1:14:29.170 --> 1:14:30.905
Mother of God.

1:14:30.938 --> 1:14:32.373
If those bombers
reach the city...

1:14:32.406 --> 1:14:34.108
We have
to do something.

1:14:34.141 --> 1:14:35.376
We can't just sit here.

1:14:35.409 --> 1:14:36.744
Where's Hawkman?

1:14:38.078 --> 1:14:39.713
We might not have to.

1:14:39.747 --> 1:14:40.414
Look.

1:14:43.117 --> 1:14:44.151
What in the world?

1:14:45.452 --> 1:14:47.021
No...

1:14:47.054 --> 1:14:48.155
not this world.

1:15:34.435 --> 1:15:35.302
You shaved.

1:15:36.503 --> 1:15:37.371
Shakespeare?

1:15:39.006 --> 1:15:40.007
Clark.

1:15:40.040 --> 1:15:41.475
My real name is Clark.

1:15:41.508 --> 1:15:43.210
But you can call him...

1:15:43.244 --> 1:15:44.111
Superman.

1:15:45.312 --> 1:15:47.147
I don't understand.

1:15:47.181 --> 1:15:48.782
Weren't you just a reporter?

1:15:49.383 --> 1:15:52.186
I was... Am.

1:15:52.219 --> 1:15:54.088
But I couldn't sit
on the sidelines any longer.

1:15:55.889 --> 1:15:57.424
I guess it was time
to get in the game.

1:16:00.160 --> 1:16:01.028
Diana.

1:16:08.969 --> 1:16:09.837
Steve?

1:16:12.973 --> 1:16:14.308
Stay still.

1:16:14.341 --> 1:16:15.976
We'll get a doctor. We'll...

1:16:16.010 --> 1:16:17.945
Ah, come on, princess.

1:16:17.978 --> 1:16:20.581
We both know
that ain't happening.

1:16:22.449 --> 1:16:24.885
This can't be.

1:16:24.918 --> 1:16:26.887
I thought when
the war was over, we'd...

1:16:30.090 --> 1:16:31.825
Tomorrow is never guaranteed.

1:16:33.394 --> 1:16:34.361
Only today.

1:16:35.863 --> 1:16:37.364
Right now.

1:16:37.398 --> 1:16:39.033
That's why we fight, right?

1:16:43.070 --> 1:16:43.971
But honestly...

1:16:45.372 --> 1:16:46.373
being with you...

1:16:47.441 --> 1:16:48.842
I wouldn't trade it for all

1:16:48.876 --> 1:16:50.311
the tomorrows in the world.

1:16:53.514 --> 1:16:54.982
So what do you say, Diana?

1:16:56.417 --> 1:16:58.986
Grant a dying man
his final request?

1:17:36.990 --> 1:17:39.093
Where's Aquaman's crony?

1:17:39.126 --> 1:17:40.394
I don't know
where he went.

1:17:40.427 --> 1:17:41.929
There's not a trace.

1:17:41.962 --> 1:17:44.298
And trust me,
this is what I do.

1:17:44.331 --> 1:17:45.899
It's like he just...

1:17:45.933 --> 1:17:47.267
disappeared.

1:17:47.301 --> 1:17:48.669
Don't worry,
Future Boy.

1:17:48.702 --> 1:17:49.970
We'll find him.

1:17:50.003 --> 1:17:51.205
Leave it to us.

1:17:51.238 --> 1:17:52.539
Right now,

1:17:52.573 --> 1:17:54.274
we need to get you home.

1:17:54.308 --> 1:17:55.175
Thank you...

1:17:56.176 --> 1:17:57.177
for everything.

1:17:58.545 --> 1:18:00.147
We'll be sorry to see you go.

1:18:02.015 --> 1:18:05.252
Yeah. I wish
I could stay but...

1:18:05.285 --> 1:18:07.488
I've got a world of my own that
needs all the help it can get.

1:18:13.127 --> 1:18:14.161
I can't take this.

1:18:16.063 --> 1:18:17.464
You said...

1:18:17.498 --> 1:18:19.266
you understood why I said no.

1:18:20.501 --> 1:18:21.535
I was wrong.

1:18:22.369 --> 1:18:23.237
Don't...

1:18:24.505 --> 1:18:26.540
don't make the same mistake.

1:18:40.587 --> 1:18:41.989
- Ready, kid?
- Yeah.

1:19:25.065 --> 1:19:26.433
You were just... And then you...

1:19:27.601 --> 1:19:29.236
I guess it doesn't matter.

1:19:29.269 --> 1:19:30.370
Great work, Flash.

1:19:30.404 --> 1:19:32.005
Thank you.

1:19:32.039 --> 1:19:33.140
No problem, Shakespeare.

1:19:36.443 --> 1:19:37.544
Uh, I mean, Superman.

1:19:39.413 --> 1:19:40.280
Okay.

1:19:41.315 --> 1:19:43.050
I should be off.

1:19:43.083 --> 1:19:44.218
Nice working with you.

1:19:44.251 --> 1:19:45.619
Wait.

1:19:45.652 --> 1:19:47.588
Listen. Brainiac won't be
the last to show up

1:19:47.621 --> 1:19:49.490
and threaten our cities,
our world.

1:19:50.657 --> 1:19:52.292
There'll be others.

1:19:52.326 --> 1:19:54.127
There always are.

1:19:54.161 --> 1:19:56.263
But there are also
others like us.

1:19:56.296 --> 1:19:57.799
Heroes.

1:19:57.832 --> 1:20:00.234
Maybe if we stick together,
we can keep the peace.

1:20:00.768 --> 1:20:02.236
You know...

1:20:02.269 --> 1:20:05.339
Fight for truth, justice,
the American way.

1:20:06.540 --> 1:20:08.208
What are you suggesting?

1:20:08.242 --> 1:20:09.109
Like a club?

1:20:11.311 --> 1:20:13.180
Yeah, something like that.

1:20:24.091 --> 1:20:25.359
How long were you there?

1:20:25.392 --> 1:20:26.693
Maybe a week.

1:20:26.728 --> 1:20:28.161
Here, it wasn't even a second.

1:20:28.195 --> 1:20:29.530
- Sounds...
- Crazy?

1:20:31.198 --> 1:20:32.199
A little bit.

1:20:34.134 --> 1:20:35.737
Yeah, it was.

1:20:37.137 --> 1:20:39.306
Oh, shoot. I forgot something.

1:20:39.339 --> 1:20:41.675
Glad some things
haven't changed.

1:20:49.116 --> 1:20:50.450
The future is uncertain.

1:20:51.886 --> 1:20:54.388
It could be full of bad things
or good things.

1:20:55.489 --> 1:20:56.791
But whatever the case,

1:20:56.824 --> 1:20:59.693
it's better
to face it together.

1:20:59.727 --> 1:21:01.729
I know we said that we could
always have tomorrow,

1:21:01.763 --> 1:21:03.363
but whatever tomorrows I have,

1:21:04.398 --> 1:21:05.632
I want them to be with you.

1:21:08.302 --> 1:21:09.536
Barry.

1:21:09.570 --> 1:21:10.604
What are you doing?

1:21:15.242 --> 1:21:16.677
So, what do you say?

1:21:18.278 --> 1:21:19.146
Will you marry me?

1:21:20.815 --> 1:21:23.075
Yes.
