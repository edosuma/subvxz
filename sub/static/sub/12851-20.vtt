♪♪

00:06.140 --> 00:08.173
Something new
and exciting, please.

00:08.175 --> 00:09.375
We've done everything.

00:09.377 --> 00:11.443
Wouldn't it be
a sad situation
if that were true?

00:12.446 --> 00:14.046
-Oh...
-You got somethin'?

00:14.048 --> 00:15.547
-Oh...
-I predict that

00:15.549 --> 00:17.282
the next thing you say
is gonna be ridiculous.

00:17.284 --> 00:18.884
We should have
our Sweet Sixteen now!

00:18.886 --> 00:20.386
-I'm right.
-Why?

00:20.388 --> 00:23.055
Well, because, you see,
I just turned 15

00:23.057 --> 00:25.257
and you're eight.

00:26.460 --> 00:28.260
(sing-songy)
I have all my big teeth.

00:29.463 --> 00:31.630
We can't have a Sweet Sixteen.

00:31.632 --> 00:34.133
-I didn't get my<i> bat mitzvah.</i>
-You're not Jewish.

00:34.135 --> 00:35.401
I didn't get
my<i> quinceañera</i> .

00:35.403 --> 00:37.736
You're not Latina.

00:37.738 --> 00:39.872
I want something!
I want something now, Daddy!

00:39.874 --> 00:41.707
No, still me.

00:42.910 --> 00:44.376
What can you do for me?

00:44.378 --> 00:46.545
I can tell you it's not time
for a Sweet Sixteen yet.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.647
It's all so random.

00:48.649 --> 00:50.482
We should be able
to have it any time.

00:50.484 --> 00:52.851
They just call it
"Sweet Sixteen"
because of suh suh.

00:52.853 --> 00:54.520
No, if it was
a suh suh thing,

00:54.522 --> 00:56.522
they could have called it
"Sweet Seventeen" just as much.

00:56.524 --> 00:57.656
No, they could not.

00:57.658 --> 00:58.991
"Sweet Sixteen," you're sweet.

00:58.993 --> 01:00.325
"Seventeen," who cares already?

01:01.829 --> 01:02.995
Ooh.

01:02.997 --> 01:04.596
-You got somethin'?
-Ooh!

01:04.598 --> 01:07.332
I predict the next thing
that you say is gonna
be amazing!

01:07.334 --> 01:09.334
See, that right there
is the difference
between me and you.

01:09.336 --> 01:11.537
What if we did
suh suh suh?

01:11.539 --> 01:13.205
Oh!
Impossible!

01:13.207 --> 01:15.007
No one's ever done
the suh suh suh before.

01:16.577 --> 01:19.078
-What is it?
-"Surprise Sweet Sixteen."

01:19.080 --> 01:20.446

Surprise.

01:20.448 --> 01:21.647

What are the historical markers
of our lives?

02:30.484 --> 02:31.450
Most important first.

02:31.452 --> 02:33.285
-Sweet Sixteen.
-No.

02:33.287 --> 02:35.120
Arbor Day!

02:35.122 --> 02:38.357
No. Even Sweet Sixteen is
more important than Arbor Day.

02:39.460 --> 02:41.593
-Sweet Sixteen.
-Arbor Day!

02:42.930 --> 02:45.264
No, most important first.

02:45.266 --> 02:48.333
Sweet Sixteen is the doorway
to our driver's license.

02:48.335 --> 02:51.270
Arbor Day is the doorway
to nobody knows what it is.

02:52.473 --> 02:53.705
And college.

02:53.707 --> 02:54.873
You're going without me?

02:54.875 --> 02:56.475
No, you're going to
the little one next door.

02:56.477 --> 02:58.477
Yay!

02:58.479 --> 03:00.379
-Farkle?
-Birth.

03:00.381 --> 03:03.315
Okay, let's go with that
because it's not what you said.

03:04.485 --> 03:05.651
What's next?

03:05.653 --> 03:07.452
I win the Nobel Prize
for Physics.

03:08.556 --> 03:10.022
Smackle, we just got born.

03:10.024 --> 03:11.757
Okay. I'll wait.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.726
-Our first birthday.
-Okay, birth.

03:14.728 --> 03:18.664
So then, we celebrate
our birth every year.
What's next?

03:18.666 --> 03:20.866
I win the Nobel Prize
for Physics.

03:21.969 --> 03:23.468
Not yet.

03:23.470 --> 03:24.970
Get to it!

03:26.140 --> 03:28.240
Our first steps,
our first words,

03:28.242 --> 03:29.474
our first day
at school.

03:29.476 --> 03:31.076
-(students groan)
-Yay!

03:31.078 --> 03:34.213
The day I met Riley and Maya
and Smackle and Lucas and Zay.

03:36.517 --> 03:39.251
Okay, so we get born.

03:39.253 --> 03:41.320
We learn to walk and talk.

03:41.322 --> 03:43.655
We meet our friends.
Then what?

03:43.657 --> 03:45.490
You know.

03:46.927 --> 03:49.494
Then we grew up and we're not
little kids anymore.

03:49.496 --> 03:50.596
And it went by fast,
didn't it?

03:50.598 --> 03:53.565
It goes by very fast,
Mr. Babineaux.

03:53.567 --> 03:57.002
Your adventures
were my adventures

03:57.004 --> 03:58.203
not very long ago.

03:58.205 --> 04:00.205
Then we have our various
coming of age ceremonies.

04:00.207 --> 04:01.440
Oh, you mean like...

04:01.442 --> 04:04.343
I want us to have
a Surprise Sweet Sixteen party.

04:04.345 --> 04:06.445
Riley, how is it a surprise
if we all know about it?

04:06.447 --> 04:07.746
'Cause we're gonna have it now

04:07.748 --> 04:10.148
while we're all 15
and you're 24.

04:12.586 --> 04:15.887
Okay, everybody,
make a big surprise face.

04:15.889 --> 04:17.789
(students gasp)

04:19.193 --> 04:20.859
Yeah, don't do that.

04:22.296 --> 04:24.596
And anyway,
it doesn't matter.
It doesn't count.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.431
I mean, it must have been
a "Sweet Sixteen" for a reason.

04:26.433 --> 04:28.300
Why? I don't care.

04:28.302 --> 04:29.635
Well, now actually,

04:29.637 --> 04:31.103
Zay brings up
an interesting point.

04:31.105 --> 04:33.105
No, I don't.

04:33.107 --> 04:36.575
Riley has an instinct
to accelerate the clock.

04:36.577 --> 04:37.743
Why do you think that is?

04:37.745 --> 04:40.445
Because I want a party.

04:40.447 --> 04:41.647
Try again.

04:42.983 --> 04:45.751
Well, 'cause I agree with Zay.

04:45.753 --> 04:47.452
We are growing up
very fast.

04:47.454 --> 04:48.487
What? You agree with me?

04:48.489 --> 04:49.655
Yeah.

04:49.657 --> 04:51.490
(gasps)

04:52.559 --> 04:54.626
Okay. Yeah, that was fun.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.628
Hey, but watch
this surprise face.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.363
(gasps)

04:59.767 --> 05:01.533
Okay, only one was fun.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.903
Okay, so there it is, freshmen.

05:04.905 --> 05:09.341
You guys are all gonna be
16 or 17 in your junior year.

05:09.343 --> 05:11.176
You're gonna be thinkin'
about where to go to college.

05:11.178 --> 05:12.944
Stockholm University
so I can be nearby

05:12.946 --> 05:15.580
to pick up my Nobel Prize.

05:15.582 --> 05:18.050
-We'll talk.
-We'll talk in Swedish.

05:20.020 --> 05:23.355
Okay, Smackle has
her life worked out.

05:23.357 --> 05:24.656
What about the rest of you?

05:25.659 --> 05:27.659
Are you better off
letting life surprise you

05:27.661 --> 05:30.829
or is there a way to be ready
for whatever is gonna happen?

05:30.831 --> 05:32.264
How would that be possible?

05:32.266 --> 05:35.367
By looking at the landmarks
of our lives so far.

05:35.369 --> 05:38.603
Have they prepared you
for what's gonna come next?

05:38.605 --> 05:40.972
Happy Sweet Sixteen, everybody.

05:40.974 --> 05:45.177
Your assignment is to tell me
what's gonna happen next.

05:51.652 --> 05:53.318
Okay, let's pretend
that we've finished

05:53.320 --> 05:55.287
our sophomore year
and we're juniors now.

05:55.289 --> 05:57.122
What's changed?

05:57.124 --> 05:58.890
I don't understand
what could be calculated
by projecting the future.

05:58.892 --> 06:00.158
You and Maya still best friends?

06:00.160 --> 06:01.660
-Better than now.
-Absolutely.

06:01.662 --> 06:04.463
-That is speculation.
-Speculation is not scientific.

06:04.465 --> 06:05.630
We can't learn
anything this way.

06:05.632 --> 06:06.965
You and I still together?

06:08.068 --> 06:09.601
-I hope so.
-Both: Huh.

06:10.671 --> 06:12.871
Riley's confidence
in her relationship with Maya

06:12.873 --> 06:14.806
is far stronger
than her confidence in Lucas.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.808
-Well, what can
we take from this?
-I end up with Lucas.

06:16.810 --> 06:18.543
-Smackle!
-Yeah, like yelling at me

06:18.545 --> 06:21.012
is gonna change
the course of destiny.

06:21.014 --> 06:22.981
You're not confident in us?

06:24.051 --> 06:25.484
I'm hopeful for us.

06:25.486 --> 06:26.585
But Maya?

06:26.587 --> 06:28.520
Both:
We're forever.

06:28.522 --> 06:30.689
-I believe 'em.
-So do I.

06:30.691 --> 06:32.491
It's what gives me hope
for all of us.

06:32.493 --> 06:34.493
So, regular friends
are stronger relationships

06:34.495 --> 06:35.660
than boyfriends
and girlfriends.

06:35.662 --> 06:37.863
Or are those types
of relationships so new to us,

06:37.865 --> 06:39.765
we simply don't
understand them yet?

06:39.767 --> 06:41.433
Well, maybe that's why
we take up a whole lot

06:41.435 --> 06:43.702
of high school trying
to figure them out.

06:43.704 --> 06:45.270
I'm hopeful for us too, Riley.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.107
What is that?

06:49.109 --> 06:51.209
They know there's vulnerability
in that kind of relationship,

06:51.211 --> 06:52.577
-and yet that happened.
-What is that?

06:52.579 --> 06:53.912
-What just happened there?
-Feelings.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.348
How are we supposed
to measure feelings?

06:56.350 --> 06:58.750
How are we supposed to know
what we're gonna feel
when we're juniors?

06:58.752 --> 07:00.619
What kind of dumb-head
assignment is this?

07:00.621 --> 07:03.121
Get out the way.
She gonna explode.

07:03.123 --> 07:05.690
I'm gonna fail
this assignment!

07:06.627 --> 07:08.593
I'm gonna fail
this assignment.

07:08.595 --> 07:09.661
Click.

07:13.133 --> 07:14.399
Wh-- what happened?

07:14.401 --> 07:15.734
She crashed.

07:15.736 --> 07:17.636
-What, like a computer?
-Yeah, it's like

07:17.638 --> 07:19.738
the little rainbow wheel
is spinning. She'll be back.

07:19.740 --> 07:21.873
-Lucas, can I talk
to you for a second?
-Sure.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.268
Maya?

07:33.269 --> 07:34.752
What if we don't care
about our boyfriends

07:34.755 --> 07:36.221
as much as we care
about each other?

07:41.895 --> 07:44.262
No, we'll just care
for them in a different way.

07:44.264 --> 07:45.764
What different way?

07:45.766 --> 07:46.832
Less.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.770
Why do we make friendships
if they're only gonna go away?

07:51.772 --> 07:53.638
Why do they have to go away?

07:55.409 --> 07:57.809
'Cause we're supposed to
think like juniors now.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.744
So? What's gonna be different?

07:59.746 --> 08:02.647
(mouthing)

08:02.649 --> 08:04.683
Well, right now, there are
millions of juniors

08:04.685 --> 08:07.652
all over the world deciding
what college they want
to get into.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.657
And even though they say
that they're all gonna

08:12.659 --> 08:15.827
be friends forever, they're all
going some place, Maya.

08:17.498 --> 08:19.831
We're going to
the same college, right?

08:19.833 --> 08:21.967
-Riley--
-We're going to
the same college.

08:21.969 --> 08:25.136
What if I need to go to Europe
or something to study Art?

08:25.138 --> 08:26.972
You will, so get into
the same college as me.

08:26.974 --> 08:29.608
No, I won't.
We're supposed to
think like juniors.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.376
That's when we know
we don't stay together forever.

08:34.715 --> 08:37.716
Sweet Sixteen
isn't sweet at all.

08:37.718 --> 08:39.217
They lied to us.

08:39.219 --> 08:42.854
Okay, you two are
the strangest people alive.

08:44.358 --> 08:46.892
-Press any key to continue.
-Never mind.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.736
What'd I miss?

08:57.738 --> 09:00.839
Well, Riley and Maya
are more important
than Riley and Lucas.

09:00.841 --> 09:02.307
I don't think
anybody missed that.

09:02.309 --> 09:03.575
I like your glasses.

09:03.577 --> 09:05.477
Oh. I just got 'em.

09:05.479 --> 09:06.878
Oh, uh, and we probably

09:06.880 --> 09:08.547
won't be together
after high school anymore.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.750
Oh.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.385
Click.

09:13.387 --> 09:15.487
All right, will you stop that?
Who does that?

09:15.489 --> 09:16.888
Both:
Click.

09:26.667 --> 09:28.333
-Listen.
-Yeah?

09:28.335 --> 09:29.734
-Look.
-Yeah?

09:29.736 --> 09:33.271
-Listen.
-I don't want to
get old here, Farkle.

09:33.273 --> 09:35.707
I just want you to know
that if Smackle has
feelings for you--

09:35.709 --> 09:37.409
-Farkle--
-Shmeh.

09:37.411 --> 09:38.944
-I would step aside.
-Farkle--

09:38.946 --> 09:39.945
Shmeh!

09:41.181 --> 09:42.881
It's true.

09:42.883 --> 09:45.016
Smackle and I are
people of science.
We don't do well with feelings.

09:45.018 --> 09:46.885
If it's you she wants,
I would step aside.

09:46.887 --> 09:48.453
I learned that from Riley.

09:48.455 --> 09:51.957
You and Riley have
the deepest feelings
I have ever known.

09:51.959 --> 09:53.458
Thanks.

09:53.460 --> 09:55.961
And if Smackle is into you,
I-- I won't take it out on you.

09:55.963 --> 09:57.562
I'll just...

09:57.564 --> 09:59.497
I'll just clone you
and do terrible things
to the clone.

10:00.734 --> 10:01.800
Are we all gonna be okay?

10:02.903 --> 10:04.402
We always will be.

10:04.404 --> 10:05.904
How do you know?

10:05.906 --> 10:07.639
She believes in us, Farkle.

10:07.641 --> 10:09.274
I mean, yeah,
but things change.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.776
The natural evolution
of all beings is to grow
and change.

10:12.813 --> 10:14.245
Hey, I know this.

10:14.247 --> 10:16.581
What kind of teacher is
your father supposed to be?

10:16.583 --> 10:17.882
I'm going to fail
this assignment

10:17.884 --> 10:20.385
and he's gonna cost me
my Nobel Prize.

10:20.387 --> 10:21.920
Does he know
what he's doing?

10:21.922 --> 10:24.589
Yes, he does.

10:24.591 --> 10:27.425
Finches and mockingbirds,
his boat was<i> The Beagle,</i>

10:27.427 --> 10:29.761
and for extra credit,
Galapagos.

10:29.763 --> 10:31.129
Charles Darwin.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.431
How do you know
the theory of evolution?

10:33.433 --> 10:35.266
Because I failed it.

10:35.268 --> 10:38.436
I know it because I failed it,
but he made sure I knew it

10:38.438 --> 10:40.305
because he knew
I'd need it someday.

10:42.009 --> 10:44.175
He's a great teacher.

10:45.646 --> 10:47.445
He's the best there is.

10:47.447 --> 10:50.448
And like always,

10:50.450 --> 10:52.917
he's just trying
to get us to evolve.

11:01.962 --> 11:03.795
Tell us about Cory and Topanga.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.463
-What about 'em?
-How they happened.

11:05.465 --> 11:07.365
How'd you make such
an important decision so young?

11:07.367 --> 11:09.367
-Do we know what we're doing?
-What's gonna happen to us?

11:09.369 --> 11:11.036
What if we mess up
our entire lives?

11:11.038 --> 11:13.271
-What if everything changes?
-You asked two questions.

11:13.273 --> 11:14.639
You can ask two questions.

11:14.641 --> 11:16.841
-No, you ruined the whole thing.
-Sorry, let's start over.

11:16.843 --> 11:18.443
No!

11:18.445 --> 11:20.478
You're nuts because
your father gave you
an assignment?

11:20.480 --> 11:22.147
-What do you think?
-What's the assignment?

11:22.149 --> 11:24.349
I wanted a Surprise
Sweet Sixteen party now.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.051
Diabolical.

11:26.053 --> 11:28.353
So, we're supposed to
be 16 and think about
what happens next.

11:28.355 --> 11:29.854
-And you're scared.
-Well, sure.

11:29.856 --> 11:31.890
What if Maya and I don't get
into the same college?

11:31.892 --> 11:34.693
Why would that happen?
What happened to all
those A's you've been getting?

11:34.695 --> 11:36.194
I only got
one A in Spanish.

11:36.196 --> 11:37.862
You're not getting
into a good college

11:37.864 --> 11:40.465
-with only one A in Spanish!
-You loved me once.

11:41.501 --> 11:43.835
So, I'm going
to a lesser school

11:43.837 --> 11:45.336
so we can always
be together.

11:45.338 --> 11:47.505
Uh-huh. And now you say...

11:47.507 --> 11:48.973
-Okay.
-Both: Yay!

11:48.975 --> 11:50.475
No!

11:50.477 --> 11:53.845
What kind of an idiot gives up
a top school for someone else?

11:53.847 --> 11:55.046
You.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.881
You gave up Yale for Dad.

11:59.820 --> 12:03.655
Look, Topanga! I went in
with two different socks!

12:04.891 --> 12:07.092
You know why? I woke up
this morning and thought,

12:07.094 --> 12:09.594
"What's the one thing
in my life that I haven't done?"

12:09.596 --> 12:12.063
Well, now I've done it.

12:13.433 --> 12:15.900
It's been a complete life.

12:15.902 --> 12:17.001
(groans)

12:20.040 --> 12:23.875
Oh, yeah, I...
I gave up Yale
for your dad.

12:23.877 --> 12:25.610
I call a do over.

12:25.612 --> 12:27.045
Really?

12:27.047 --> 12:29.080
If I had my life
to do over again,

12:29.082 --> 12:31.015
I would do
exactly the same thing.

12:31.017 --> 12:33.251
So...

12:35.055 --> 12:38.089
it turns out today
wasn't Crazy Hair Day
at school at all.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.758
You know what it was?

12:39.760 --> 12:41.259
Photo Day.

12:43.630 --> 12:48.366
And in other news, today,
I learned the word "wedgie."

12:53.206 --> 12:55.406
You can make
all the plans you want.

12:55.408 --> 12:57.709
The truth is, we don't know
what's going to happen.

12:57.711 --> 13:00.378
And your two-socks-wearing
father knows that too.

13:00.380 --> 13:02.614
So, why would he give you
this assignment?

13:02.616 --> 13:05.483
He wants us to look
at the landmarks of our lives.

13:05.485 --> 13:08.286
He said maybe
they can prepare us
for what comes next.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.621
He's right.

13:09.623 --> 13:11.322
That, you can do.

13:11.324 --> 13:12.991
I was a unique, young girl,

13:12.993 --> 13:15.126
I met a boy
named Cory Matthews...

13:15.128 --> 13:16.461
I kept some of my friends,

13:16.463 --> 13:18.296
some I don't see
so much of anymore,

13:18.298 --> 13:19.564
I'm an excellent attorney,

13:19.566 --> 13:21.633
my husband is
an excellent teacher,

13:21.635 --> 13:24.068
we have two children
that we love.

13:24.070 --> 13:27.572
What we do
and who you are is
how we contribute to society.

13:27.574 --> 13:29.974
So, looking back
at the landmarks

13:29.976 --> 13:32.477
of my life,
here's what I know.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.078
No.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.580
No do over.

13:40.754 --> 13:42.720
Life knows we're forever,
doesn't it?

13:58.038 --> 13:59.103
Hi.

14:00.774 --> 14:02.207
Hello.

14:03.810 --> 14:05.443
There are lots
of empty seats around,

14:05.445 --> 14:07.011
and yet you are
sitting very close.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.880
Oh. Does that bother you?

14:08.882 --> 14:10.181
Well, as you know,
I don't like to be

14:10.183 --> 14:12.016
sat right next to
except for Farkle.

14:12.018 --> 14:13.818
You have very nice eyes.

14:13.820 --> 14:17.188
Okay. They formed in utero,
starting with my optic nerves
and then my retinas.

14:17.190 --> 14:20.024
So it's okay
with you if I just
stay right here, right?

14:20.026 --> 14:21.960
Well, you know,
Farkle's not here

14:21.962 --> 14:24.095
and you're invading
my personal space like a Hun.

14:26.166 --> 14:30.201
If Farkle was here,
you would be making a joke
like I was hitting on you.

14:31.671 --> 14:34.172
You know what?
Maybe everything will stay

14:34.174 --> 14:37.242
exactly the way it is
and 16 will be just as sweet

14:37.244 --> 14:38.943
as all of our other years.

14:40.046 --> 14:42.513
And now,
here we are.

14:42.515 --> 14:44.716
Finally alone.

14:44.718 --> 14:46.384
And there is something
I want to admit to you.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.887
-You're hot for my mind?
-No.

14:48.889 --> 14:52.090
You mean you only see me
as a steaming cauldron
of woman?

14:52.092 --> 14:53.558
Okay.

14:55.161 --> 14:58.196
Lucas Friar, my heart
belongs to someone else.

14:58.198 --> 15:00.098
-Say it louder.
-Must I torture you?

15:00.100 --> 15:01.666
Would you please?

15:01.668 --> 15:04.335
I just always say those things

15:04.337 --> 15:06.204
because I guess
I'm a little insecure

15:06.206 --> 15:07.839
that Farkle doesn't really,
really like me as much

15:07.841 --> 15:10.608
as he says, so I guess I'm just
trying to protect myself.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.279
You don't have to, Isadora.

15:14.281 --> 15:16.514
I like you exactly
as much as I say.

15:16.516 --> 15:19.217
It's possible
I might even like you
more than "like you."

15:19.219 --> 15:21.286
I don't know. Right now,
that's just a hypothesis.

15:21.288 --> 15:22.387
Based on what?

15:22.389 --> 15:23.621
(sighs)

15:23.623 --> 15:25.523
Should have seen
how nervous he was
from back here.

15:26.626 --> 15:27.959
I think we're a perfect match.

15:27.961 --> 15:30.128
-You do?
-Yeah.

15:31.731 --> 15:33.531
Lucas knew how
you really felt,
but I wasn't sure.

15:35.302 --> 15:37.302
-You can go now.
-No, stay where you are.

15:37.304 --> 15:39.938
-Smackle.
-You may proceed.

15:39.940 --> 15:41.873
Lucas set this up
so I could know how
you really felt.

15:41.875 --> 15:43.541
Now you know.

15:47.547 --> 15:51.783
Define "I might even like you
more than 'like you.'"

15:51.785 --> 15:53.885
I like you so much
that when I'm 16,

15:53.887 --> 15:56.287
I'll tell you to go study
in Sweden if you really want to.

15:57.424 --> 16:00.325
No. I'm going to
stupid Princeton with you.

16:01.995 --> 16:04.062
Sweden? Princeton?

16:04.064 --> 16:05.330
What's the difference?

16:06.633 --> 16:09.133
They're going away.

16:09.135 --> 16:12.136
Why do people become friends
if it's not going to be forever?

16:13.406 --> 16:15.340
I don't want
a Sweet Sixteen.

16:15.342 --> 16:17.642
You don't?

16:17.644 --> 16:19.310
No.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.145
I don't want any surprises.

16:21.147 --> 16:22.814
I don't want anybody
to go anywhere.

16:22.816 --> 16:25.483
I don't want anything
to happen to us at all.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.318
But isn't that
the opposite of life?

16:27.320 --> 16:28.519
I don't care.

16:28.521 --> 16:30.288
Nobody move.

16:30.290 --> 16:31.889
Nobody move at all.

16:35.362 --> 16:37.195
You heard her.

16:42.602 --> 16:46.137
Okay, juniors,
how are your lives going?

16:46.139 --> 16:47.872
What's next for you?

16:52.045 --> 16:53.445
Smarkle.

16:53.446 --> 16:54.846
Well, Smackle and I have applied
early decision to Princeton

16:54.848 --> 16:57.215
and I have a pretty good feeling
we're gonna get in.

16:57.217 --> 17:00.184
Is that because
you've maintained
your excellent academic record?

17:00.186 --> 17:02.387
Yes, and because
in the last two years,

17:02.389 --> 17:03.788
we've cured
the common cold,

17:03.790 --> 17:05.656
invented an
alternative fuel source,

17:05.658 --> 17:08.292
solved global warming,
and-- (sneezes)

17:09.662 --> 17:11.729
Ah, crud.

17:11.731 --> 17:14.198
So, I take it Farkle
and Smackle are still together.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.134
-Yeah.
-We have feelings

17:16.136 --> 17:17.535
for each other
we must figure out.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.370
Because we're
people of science.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.405
It may take forever.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.741
-Good.
-Good.

17:25.645 --> 17:27.412
Both:
Thank you.
We are Smarkle.

17:27.414 --> 17:29.447
(students clap)

17:32.018 --> 17:33.251
All right.

17:33.253 --> 17:34.585
Lucas and Zay.

17:38.491 --> 17:41.025
Well, I think that
the big news is that

17:41.027 --> 17:43.361
Lucas peaked
in his sophomore year
and now it's Zay time.

17:43.363 --> 17:44.896
Hm. This is not
what we decided on.

17:44.898 --> 17:46.764
It is not my fault
that you peaked.

17:46.766 --> 17:49.233
-You're over.
-Yeah? What happened to me?

17:49.235 --> 17:50.835
Know, you say that a lot now,

17:50.837 --> 17:52.270
where you're just like,
"What happened to me?"

17:52.272 --> 17:54.272
and I pull you around
in your little red wagon.

17:54.274 --> 17:55.773
You're like,
"What happened to me?"

17:55.775 --> 17:57.041
and I'm like,
"I don't know!

17:57.043 --> 17:58.776
It's Zay time.
Stop bringing me down."

18:00.213 --> 18:02.613
So, I'm guessing
you've managed
to remain friends.

18:02.615 --> 18:04.382
That'll never change.

18:04.384 --> 18:07.218
I used to have
a little red wagon.

18:07.220 --> 18:09.420
You used to pull me
around in it.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.622
Hey, if things
ever do go bad...

18:11.624 --> 18:13.291
I'll be there.

18:14.294 --> 18:15.426
Thank you, gentlemen.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.297
So when did things
start going bad?

18:19.299 --> 18:20.898
Oh, the triangle took
all the life out of you.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.300
Yeah.

18:23.870 --> 18:25.303
Riley, Maya?

18:28.475 --> 18:31.375
We looked at all
of the landmarks
of our lives.

18:31.377 --> 18:33.478
We don't really have
any control over being born.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.446
We just know that
we're real lucky to be here.

18:35.448 --> 18:38.449
And if we get even luckier,
we climb in through
the right window.

18:38.451 --> 18:39.617
Yeah.

18:39.619 --> 18:42.086
We examined all
of the landmarks
of our lives

18:42.088 --> 18:44.088
from the very beginning
right up until wanting

18:44.090 --> 18:45.623
a Surprise Sweet Sixteen party.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.725
And we found they all
have one thing in common.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.660
They all put us
in a world of people,

18:49.662 --> 18:53.297
and what we do control
is the people that we want
to keep in our lives,

18:53.299 --> 18:57.602
and a party at any age
is just another chance
to be all together.

18:57.604 --> 19:00.638
So, I take it
you're not ready
for your Sweet Sixteen.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.573
No.

19:02.575 --> 19:04.976
Maybe never.

19:04.978 --> 19:07.445
I didn't want us
to go anywhere.

19:07.447 --> 19:09.680
I wanted us to sit still.

19:09.682 --> 19:11.682
But that's not life.

19:11.684 --> 19:13.484
We're freshmen.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.486
Exactly where
we're supposed to be.

19:15.488 --> 19:18.189
We should enjoy this now.
That's life.

19:18.191 --> 19:21.626
Sweet Sixteen will be
a lot sweeter when we are 16.

19:21.628 --> 19:24.495
But for right now,
we're protected.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.697
We know exactly
where we're gonna be
for the next three years.

19:26.699 --> 19:29.500
-So, no party.
-No, of course party.

19:31.137 --> 19:32.970
What our landmarks
have shown us is that

19:32.972 --> 19:35.706
we picked the right friends
and we'll always be together.

19:35.708 --> 19:38.276
Life loves us.

19:38.278 --> 19:40.711
Hope isn't for
suckers after all.

19:42.949 --> 19:46.551
And that's the best thing
to celebrate any time.

19:51.958 --> 19:53.457
Party time!

19:53.459 --> 19:55.159
Does it have to be
at our house?

19:55.161 --> 19:56.827
Life loves our house.

19:56.829 --> 19:58.829
(door closes)

19:58.831 --> 20:00.531
What happened?

20:02.235 --> 20:04.302
Party doesn't have to
be at our house.

20:04.304 --> 20:05.536
Tell her no, Dad!

20:06.706 --> 20:10.074
It just happened. Just happened
right in front of Auggie.

20:10.076 --> 20:11.542
He heard everything.

20:12.812 --> 20:14.011
Mom?

20:14.013 --> 20:16.681
You know,
I was a good student.

20:16.683 --> 20:19.584
I got a good job
at a prestigious law firm,

20:19.586 --> 20:21.586
I moved up fast,
I got promoted.

20:21.588 --> 20:23.487
I always wanted to be partner.

20:23.489 --> 20:27.058
They just named me partner.

20:27.060 --> 20:29.493
Oh. Double party.

20:30.496 --> 20:32.396
I am so proud
of you, Topanga.

20:33.433 --> 20:34.432
Tell her no, Dad.

20:34.434 --> 20:36.434
Why would I tell her no?

20:36.436 --> 20:39.937
They just named me the head
of our London office.

20:41.574 --> 20:44.408
Ask her how she's going
to do that from here.

20:44.410 --> 20:47.578
Ask her because
she won't answer me.

20:50.450 --> 20:52.984
I am so proud
of you, Topanga.

20:54.354 --> 20:55.886
Oh, yeah.

20:55.888 --> 20:58.022
I'm so proud
of you too, Mom.

20:59.892 --> 21:01.993
Congratulations.

21:04.197 --> 21:07.031
I thought life loves us.

21:07.967 --> 21:09.800
Surprise.

21:17.143 --> 21:19.277
What did you tell them, Mom?

21:19.279 --> 21:20.544
Riley--

21:20.546 --> 21:21.679
Wait.

21:23.149 --> 21:24.782
Okay.

21:24.784 --> 21:27.818
I told them that
I needed some time
to think about it.

21:27.820 --> 21:31.088
I told them that
I needed to talk it over
with my family.

21:31.090 --> 21:32.490
What's to talk about?

21:32.492 --> 21:34.558
I'm not going to London.

21:34.560 --> 21:37.261
I don't even speak the language.

21:37.263 --> 21:40.965
Uh, did they offer you
a raise in salary?

21:46.572 --> 21:48.172
Long live the Queen!

21:49.275 --> 21:52.576
Hip hip! Wot wot!
Elton John!

21:53.613 --> 21:55.680
Chimney sweeps!

21:55.682 --> 21:57.615
Crumpets!

21:57.617 --> 22:00.985
Girls, this decision has
nothing to do with money.

22:02.121 --> 22:04.255
Of course it doesn't.

22:07.093 --> 22:08.426
Girls...

22:08.428 --> 22:10.761
listen, I know
this is difficult.

22:12.131 --> 22:13.831
Don't worry.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.566
We're gonna make
the right decision.

22:17.637 --> 22:20.671
Mom... there's a decision?

22:20.673 --> 22:22.973
Yeah.

22:22.975 --> 22:26.944
Girls, I'm sorry,
but there's a decision.

22:34.554 --> 22:36.354
