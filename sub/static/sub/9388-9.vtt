We're gonna settle this like men.

22:41.187 --> 22:44.189
All right, we'll settle it like men.
But not here.

22:44.355 --> 22:47.233
- Meet me out in the alley in 20 minutes.
- I'll be there.

22:47.400 --> 22:50.360
You be there too,
you little faggot.

22:51.987 --> 22:54.156
All right, Peter, I'm here.

22:54.323 --> 22:55.949
Where are you?

22:56.116 --> 22:57.700
Oh, a piece of candy.

22:57.867 --> 22:59.660
Oh, a piece of candy.

22:59.827 --> 23:01.245
Oh, a piece of candy.

23:01.412 --> 23:02.913
Oh, a piece of candy.

23:03.079 --> 23:04.372
Oh, a piece of candy.

23:04.539 --> 23:05.832
Oh, piece of candy.

23:05.999 --> 23:07.292
Oh, a piece of candy.

23:07.459 --> 23:08.709
Oh, a piece of candy.

23:08.876 --> 23:10.586
Oh, a piece of candy.

23:12.630 --> 23:16.591
Okay, next time let's remember this
right away because he's done this twice.

23:20.261 --> 23:22.638
Oh, Peter, we're so glad
to have you back.

23:22.804 --> 23:25.307
- I missed you.
- I missed you too, Lois.

23:25.474 --> 23:27.183
So, what happened to James Woods?

23:27.350 --> 23:29.894
Oh, he's being examined by top men.

23:30.061 --> 23:33.730
- Who?
- Top men.
