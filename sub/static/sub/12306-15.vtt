[door creaks]

00:46.280 --> 00:48.533
Hello?

00:48.540 --> 00:50.508
Anyone in here?

01:11.130 --> 01:12.768
[clatter]

01:24.810 --> 01:26.699
Seriously?

01:44.470 --> 01:45.869

01:58.110 --> 02:00.408
You got to be
kidding me.

[motor running]

02:20.540 --> 02:22.235
Oht

02:26.210 --> 02:27.302
Ohh!

02:27.310 --> 02:30.507
[groaning]

02:58.340 --> 02:59.899
Who's the guy
in the conference room?

02:59.910 --> 03:02.629
Coach baker of
pacific canyon high school.

03:02.650 --> 03:04.436
Juvenile stalking case.

03:04.450 --> 03:05.144
He's young.

03:05.150 --> 03:07.608
He's one of those jocks
who ends up

03:07.620 --> 03:08.519
Back where he started.

03:08.520 --> 03:09.817
- You're bitter
in the morning.

03:09.820 --> 03:12.448
I'm suspect of anyone who
willingly goes back to high school.

03:12.450 --> 03:14.509
He claims he's being
stalked by a female student.

03:14.520 --> 03:15.681
He came forward
when it escalated.

03:15.690 --> 03:18.352
No prior claims
through campus security

03:18.360 --> 03:19.350
Or lausd.

03:19.360 --> 03:20.555
He notified
the principal,

03:20.560 --> 03:22.198
Who contacted
the juvenile division.

03:22.200 --> 03:23.429
They kicked it to us.

03:23.430 --> 03:24.864
Teen stalkers are
highly unpredictable.

03:24.870 --> 03:27.328
They're the most likely
to suddenly turn violent.

03:27.340 --> 03:28.694
What'd she do
to him?

03:28.700 --> 03:31.670
Nearly crushed him
in the gym bleachers.

03:31.670 --> 03:33.502
Teens are mean.

03:35.410 --> 03:36.377
[knock on door]

03:36.380 --> 03:37.438
Morning.
Morning.

03:37.450 --> 03:38.599
I spoke
to perry's father.

03:38.610 --> 03:40.749
He supplied me with
perry's credit card numbers

03:40.750 --> 03:41.842
And bank accounts.

03:41.850 --> 03:43.113
Perry's father's
cooperating?

03:43.120 --> 03:44.372
Not exactly.
He doesn't want his kid

03:44.390 --> 03:46.779
To get in any trouble,
but he wants him found.

03:46.790 --> 03:47.746
Nothing on ray?

03:47.760 --> 03:50.354
No, but we know
they're together.

03:50.360 --> 03:51.987
We find perry,
we find ray.

03:51.990 --> 03:55.756
I'd like to run with
this if that's cool.

03:55.760 --> 03:58.070
Yeah.

03:58.070 --> 03:59.424
You ok?

03:59.440 --> 04:01.465
I think so.
I just, um--

04:01.470 --> 04:05.168
I need to stay busy. I
think that works best for me.

04:05.170 --> 04:07.400
Janice and I
will take the coach.

04:07.410 --> 04:09.572
Keep me posted.

04:17.850 --> 04:19.738
[yawns]

04:26.930 --> 04:29.058
Good morning.

04:31.330 --> 04:32.798
What are you doing?

04:32.800 --> 04:34.393
Waiting for you
to wake up.

04:34.400 --> 04:38.507
I didn't want to
disturb you with noise.

04:39.940 --> 04:42.432
Picked up
a few things for you.

04:42.440 --> 04:45.080
Um, prepaid phone,
some toiletries,

04:45.080 --> 04:46.172
Some clothes.

04:46.180 --> 04:48.672
Just guessed
at the size.

04:48.680 --> 04:50.671
Oh, and I have
breakfast and coffee.

04:50.690 --> 04:53.182
I wasn't sure if you had
any dietary restrictions,

04:53.190 --> 04:55.056
So I have options here.

04:55.060 --> 04:56.755
We got glazed
doughnuts, fruit,

04:56.760 --> 04:58.683
Or a whole wheat bagel.

04:58.690 --> 04:59.851
How do you like
your coffee?

04:59.860 --> 05:01.521
Why are you
doing this?

05:01.530 --> 05:03.396
Thought you might
be hungry.

05:03.400 --> 05:04.720
Why am I here,

05:04.730 --> 05:06.391
In LA,
in this motel?

05:06.400 --> 05:08.630
Why did you
bring me here?

05:08.640 --> 05:11.063
Yes. You want answers.
Of course.

05:11.070 --> 05:14.836
We're here for beth.
Mmm. Michelle.

05:14.840 --> 05:16.808
I'm sure you want to
see her, reconnect.

05:16.810 --> 05:18.778
It's been
a really long time.

05:18.780 --> 05:19.679
Why?

05:19.680 --> 05:20.602
Why what?

05:20.620 --> 05:23.669
What do you want
from me?

05:25.290 --> 05:28.612
A friend.

05:28.620 --> 05:30.554
I know how that
must sound,

05:30.560 --> 05:32.426
But I did just help you
get released.

05:32.430 --> 05:36.822
Surely that allows me
some goodwill.

05:36.830 --> 05:38.696
The police will be
looking for us,

05:38.700 --> 05:40.168
So we have to be careful.

05:40.170 --> 05:41.865
It's best if you just
stay in the room.

05:41.870 --> 05:43.565
There's no warrant
out for me.

05:43.570 --> 05:47.905
No, no, but beth--she's--
she's a powerful woman.

05:47.910 --> 05:49.537
He'll have resources
to find us.

05:49.550 --> 05:53.180
So, uh--um, we have to--
we have to lay low.

05:53.180 --> 05:54.170
Beth's freaking out.

05:54.180 --> 05:55.648
She's looking
over her shoulder,

05:55.650 --> 05:57.015
But if we give it
a few weeks,

05:57.020 --> 05:58.340
She'll resume her life,

05:58.350 --> 05:59.215
Let her guard down,

05:59.220 --> 06:02.315
And then--then we
establish contact.

06:03.860 --> 06:06.158
I'm not staying
here in this room

06:06.160 --> 06:09.289
With you
for a few weeks.

06:11.330 --> 06:13.822
Please, ray.

06:13.840 --> 06:17.196
If you want michelle,
you have to trust me.

06:17.210 --> 06:21.135
You have to win
her back slowly.

06:21.140 --> 06:24.235
Trust--trust is earned.

06:24.250 --> 06:26.344
It'll take time.

06:28.750 --> 06:30.570
And then what?

06:30.590 --> 06:34.242
You get michelle back,
and I get beth.

06:37.430 --> 06:39.558
Her name is jenny kline.

06:39.560 --> 06:40.550
She's a junior.

06:40.560 --> 06:42.255
She's been harassing me
now for a few weeks.

06:42.260 --> 06:43.557
Beth: She a student
of yours?

06:43.570 --> 06:45.561
No. No. She volunteered
to lead the booster club

06:45.570 --> 06:46.321
For the team,

06:46.340 --> 06:47.819
But I think it was
just an excuse

06:47.840 --> 06:48.966
To get close to me.

06:48.970 --> 06:50.131
Why is that?

06:50.140 --> 06:53.405
Well, let's face it.
I'm not ugly.

06:53.410 --> 06:55.071
Nor modest.

06:55.080 --> 06:56.673
I don't know if you
remember high school,

06:56.680 --> 06:59.308
But students are
hypersexual beings.

06:59.310 --> 07:00.675
I get a lot
of attention.

07:00.680 --> 07:02.648
You didn't do anything
that would make her think

07:02.650 --> 07:04.118
You'd be receptive?

07:04.120 --> 07:04.939
No, nothing.

07:04.950 --> 07:06.384
Janice: Why do you
think it's jenny?

07:06.390 --> 07:08.415
These texts were sent
from a prepaid cell phone.

07:08.420 --> 07:11.151
From the things she said
in the text messages.

07:11.160 --> 07:13.583
She wrote me a note
a few weeks ago.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.422
It was very graphic.

07:16.430 --> 07:18.398
Did you bring
the note?

07:18.400 --> 07:20.562
No. I shredded it.

07:20.570 --> 07:21.935
It was written
in the past tense

07:21.940 --> 07:23.192
Like we had already
been together.

07:23.210 --> 07:25.338
I didn't want anyone to see
it and get the wrong idea.

07:25.340 --> 07:27.707
Did you tell anyone
about it?

07:27.710 --> 07:30.099
Well, ignoring her
advances might have

07:30.110 --> 07:31.703
Caused her
to escalate.

07:31.710 --> 07:32.973
Escalate?

07:32.980 --> 07:34.050
She tried to
crush me.

07:34.050 --> 07:35.677
That probably wasn't
her intent.

07:35.680 --> 07:37.819
She was more than likely
trying to get your attention.

07:37.820 --> 07:38.981
Well, she has it.

07:38.990 --> 07:42.255
Look. I know I should
have reported this sooner.

07:42.260 --> 07:46.720
Because I was afraid of
your attitude, quite frankly.

07:46.730 --> 07:47.822
Rumors have
already started,

07:47.830 --> 07:51.323
And rumors become fact
in high school.

07:51.330 --> 07:53.321
_ I see a little
prejudgment on your face.

07:53.340 --> 07:56.139
Nope. That's just
my face.

07:57.040 --> 08:00.260
Woman: Jenny denies it,
and I believe her.

08:00.280 --> 08:03.409
What's been going on in
your daughter's life lately?

08:03.410 --> 08:08.678
My husband died
a year ago--leukemia.

08:08.680 --> 08:10.341
I'm so sorry.

08:10.350 --> 08:12.079
We were devastated,

08:12.090 --> 08:15.981
And jenny hasn't really
dealt with losing him.

08:15.990 --> 08:17.981
I think she feels
responsible.

08:17.990 --> 08:21.153
He needed a bone marrow
transplant.

08:21.160 --> 08:23.993
She wanted to give,
she wanted to save him,

08:24.000 --> 08:27.561
But she's adopted, so
she wasn't a viable match.

08:27.570 --> 08:29.368
She didn't know
she was adopted?

08:29.370 --> 08:33.068
We were gonna tell her
when she was 18.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.777
Finding out was
really hard on her.

08:35.780 --> 08:38.442
Has she ever mentioned
coach baker?

08:38.450 --> 08:39.975
A few times.

08:39.980 --> 08:41.470
She's involved
with the booster club,

08:41.480 --> 08:44.677
But that's important to her
because her boyfriend's on the team.

08:44.690 --> 08:47.284
Her world starts
and stops with him.

08:47.290 --> 08:48.610
What's his name?”??

08:48.620 --> 08:51.555
Emmet beaudry.

08:51.560 --> 08:53.289
Girl: I would never
hurt anyone,

08:53.300 --> 08:54.654
And why would I
want the coach?

08:54.660 --> 08:56.549
I'm dating the hottest
guy in school.

08:56.570 --> 08:59.528
Are things good
between you?

08:59.540 --> 09:00.530
Yes.

09:00.540 --> 09:05.262
I mean, mostly.
He's not talking to me.

09:05.270 --> 09:07.637
Emmet is mad
about this...

09:07.640 --> 09:10.177
Stupid thing,
and now he's really angry

09:10.180 --> 09:13.002
About the rumors
with the coach.

09:13.020 --> 09:14.078
Tell me about it.

09:14.080 --> 09:18.039
There was this online
poll that someone did.

09:18.050 --> 09:20.917
"Which teacher would you
have sex with?"

09:20.920 --> 09:23.184
I jokingly said
coach baker

09:23.190 --> 09:25.557
And got quoted
on "pc tattler."

09:25.560 --> 09:26.584
"Pc tattler"?

09:26.600 --> 09:28.352
"Pacific canyon
tattler.”

09:28.360 --> 09:30.556
It's like this
gossip blog

09:30.570 --> 09:33.062
That someone
at school does.

09:33.070 --> 09:37.394
You think emmet is
jealous of coach baker?

09:37.410 --> 09:39.868
I don't know.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.507
Well...

09:41.510 --> 09:45.504
He's playing for the guy you
said you wanted to have sex with.

09:45.510 --> 09:50.516
Yeah. Ok.
He said it sucked,

09:50.520 --> 09:53.546
But I never sent
coach baker a single text.

09:53.560 --> 09:56.586
I never flirted
with him ever.

09:56.590 --> 10:00.128
Why is this happening?

10:00.130 --> 10:03.691
I would never hurt
someone.

10:03.700 --> 10:05.794
It's not me.

10:06.600 --> 10:07.920
Janice, voice-over:
She's emotional,

10:07.940 --> 10:09.089
Which isn't
surprising, given

10:09.100 --> 10:10.431
What's going on
in her life lately.

10:10.440 --> 10:11.965
She and her boyfriend
aren't talking either.

10:11.970 --> 10:13.665
Maybe her rocky
relationship brought her

10:13.680 --> 10:15.273
To seek out a connection
to the coach

10:15.280 --> 10:16.236
That didn't exist.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.639
It's a he said/she said.

10:17.650 --> 10:19.049
Jack: Does mom
believe her?

10:19.050 --> 10:20.006
Yeah. She's concerned.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.374
She understands
the seriousness of it,

10:21.380 --> 10:23.474
But she's minimizing
jenny's behavior.

10:23.490 --> 10:26.812
Parents don't want to believe
the truth about their kids.

10:26.820 --> 10:28.879
Well, does the coach
suspect anyone else?

10:28.890 --> 10:30.949
No. Just jenny.

10:30.960 --> 10:32.519
Jenny: Yeah, mom.
It's fine.

10:32.530 --> 10:34.953
I'm with alexis.

10:34.960 --> 10:37.793
Stop worrying, ok?

10:37.800 --> 10:38.995
Bye.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.526
God, she's so
freaking worried.

10:41.540 --> 10:43.395
Alexis: I just stepped
on something.

10:43.410 --> 10:46.562
This place always
gives me the creeps.

10:46.580 --> 10:48.400
Everything gives
you the creeps.

10:48.410 --> 10:49.434
You're so weird.

10:49.440 --> 10:51.704
Ok, girls.
Talk to me.

10:51.710 --> 10:53.007
Not funny, tripp.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.101
Are you here to
see emmet?

10:54.120 --> 10:55.747
My audience wants
to know.

10:55.750 --> 10:57.218
Say hi, dirty girl.

10:57.220 --> 10:58.847
She's not a dirty girl.

10:58.850 --> 11:00.443
It was a compliment.

11:00.460 --> 11:03.885
[music playing]

11:07.430 --> 11:10.092
Hey, tripper. No
blogging tonight, all right?

11:10.100 --> 11:12.319
Tripp: Say it
to the camera.

11:12.330 --> 11:14.219
Where's emmet?

11:14.240 --> 11:18.359
He's definitely not
in the back room.

11:23.710 --> 11:26.805
Tripp: What's wrong
with your face?

11:37.020 --> 11:37.885
[gasp]

11:37.890 --> 11:39.654
Jenny? Jenny?

11:39.660 --> 11:41.128
What the what?

11:41.130 --> 11:44.896
Oh, well, that's the pot
calling the kettle slut.

11:44.900 --> 11:46.129
Hashtag slut.

11:46.130 --> 11:48.895
Tripp, would you
give it a rest?

11:48.900 --> 11:49.890
Jenny!

11:49.910 --> 11:51.639
Let her go.
She's a tool!

11:51.640 --> 11:53.608
Not now, dee.

11:53.610 --> 11:56.204
Emmet: Jenny!
Jenny!

11:56.210 --> 11:58.577
Hey. I told you.

12:00.820 --> 12:02.345
Shut up, ian!

12:02.350 --> 12:04.170
Jenny, wait up!

12:08.760 --> 12:10.683
Emmet: Jenny?

12:12.830 --> 12:16.858
Look. I'm sorry.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.759
[coughs]

12:19.430 --> 12:23.640
Would you please
answer me?

12:23.640 --> 12:25.859
Jenny?

12:25.870 --> 12:27.759
[thump]

12:34.010 --> 12:35.842
Hello?

12:41.620 --> 12:43.714
[cell phone chimes]

12:48.930 --> 12:51.297
[rustling]

12:51.300 --> 12:52.961
Unh!

12:52.970 --> 12:55.598
[grunting]

13:06.450 --> 13:09.374
[indistinct chatter]

13:09.380 --> 13:12.748
Boy: She totally
looks guilty.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.718
She did it.

13:26.030 --> 13:27.691
Can I help you?

13:27.700 --> 13:28.792
Yeah. I didn't
think so.

13:28.800 --> 13:30.734
Two guys in one week.
You're on a roll.

13:30.740 --> 13:31.866
I did none of this.

13:31.870 --> 13:33.235
You keep saying that.

13:33.240 --> 13:36.005
[laughter]

13:36.010 --> 13:38.035
[bell ringing]

13:38.050 --> 13:39.347
Ian: He broke
his collar bone

13:39.350 --> 13:40.749
And shattered
his arm.

13:40.750 --> 13:43.173
His athletic career
is shot.

13:43.190 --> 13:44.077
Scholarships gone.

13:44.090 --> 13:46.013
Did you see jenny
push him?

13:46.020 --> 13:47.090
No one did.

13:47.090 --> 13:48.512
Look. I don't
blame her.

13:48.520 --> 13:49.988
Dierdre and she used
to be best friends

13:49.990 --> 13:51.116
Until alexis
came along

13:51.130 --> 13:53.224
And showed her what--
can I be frank--

13:53.230 --> 13:54.686
A crazy-ass bitch
dierdre was.

13:54.700 --> 13:55.952
She found emmet
and me

13:55.960 --> 13:57.257
And freaked out.

13:57.270 --> 13:58.965
She was cool
until her dad died.

13:58.970 --> 14:00.597
Was she
with anyone?

14:00.600 --> 14:02.261
Alexis chased
after her.

14:02.270 --> 14:05.069
Jenny ran off,
and I-I lost her.

14:05.070 --> 14:07.209
I looked for her until
I got to her house,

14:07.210 --> 14:08.530
And she was there.

14:08.540 --> 14:09.769
How long was that?

14:09.780 --> 14:10.679
20 minutes.

14:10.680 --> 14:11.841
Look. Emmet had
it coming.

14:11.850 --> 14:13.340
The boy's
a man slut.

14:13.350 --> 14:14.806
How do you know
all this?

14:14.820 --> 14:17.642
Kids like to talk,
mr. Lapd sir.

14:17.650 --> 14:21.985
She literally destroyed
emmet's entire life.

14:21.990 --> 14:25.187
She would never
hurt emmet.

14:27.060 --> 14:28.653
Emmet says you
pushed him.

14:28.660 --> 14:31.595
Multiple witnesses saw
you two fight last night.

14:31.600 --> 14:33.420
Dierdre tell
you that?

14:33.440 --> 14:34.862
Jenny.
No! This isn't right.

14:34.870 --> 14:36.338
Someone else
is doing that.

14:36.340 --> 14:37.330
This?
Everything.

14:37.340 --> 14:38.865
The coach,
the bleachers, emmet.

14:38.870 --> 14:40.201
You left
the cabin alone.

14:40.210 --> 14:41.006
I ran home.

14:41.010 --> 14:42.535
You talk to anyone,
see anybody

14:42.540 --> 14:43.610
Between temescal
and home?

14:43.610 --> 14:45.009
No. I don't have
an alibi.

14:45.010 --> 14:46.341
I didn't hurt emmet!

14:46.350 --> 14:48.739
Ok. Emmet and his
friends were trespassing,

14:48.750 --> 14:49.945
And they were
drinking, ok,

14:49.950 --> 14:52.146
So who's to say he
didn't fall on his own?

14:52.150 --> 14:53.584
Mom.
What?

14:53.590 --> 14:57.811
Don't blame emmet.

14:57.830 --> 14:58.956
Is he ok?

14:58.960 --> 15:00.325
You're going to have
to stay away

15:00.330 --> 15:01.456
From emmet
and his family.

15:01.460 --> 15:04.327
The principal says you're
suspended for a week.

15:04.330 --> 15:08.221
And emmet's parents are
filing for a restraining order.

15:08.240 --> 15:11.392
But I haven't done
anything!

15:13.840 --> 15:15.478
[sniffles]

15:16.810 --> 15:18.608
She's showing genuine
concern for emmet.

15:18.610 --> 15:20.374
I don't know if she's
capable of hurting him.

15:20.380 --> 15:23.247
Maybe she's borderline
and adept at hiding it.

15:23.250 --> 15:25.116
What if jenny
is the victim?

15:25.120 --> 15:27.418
She has romantic links
to emmet and the coach,

15:27.420 --> 15:28.615
Rumor or not.

15:28.620 --> 15:30.588
Jenny's
the common denominator.

15:30.590 --> 15:31.853
Triangulation?

15:31.860 --> 15:33.123
Love-obsessed
stalker

15:33.130 --> 15:34.882
Who's trying to get rid of
jenny's other attachments?

15:34.900 --> 15:36.390
I'll start online.
Her facebook will be

15:36.400 --> 15:38.357
More forthcoming
that she'll be.

15:38.370 --> 15:40.520
I got an alert for one
of perry's accounts.

15:40.540 --> 15:41.996
He took the max
withdrawal from a bank

15:42.000 --> 15:45.607
Off the 5 in valencia--
$5,000 cash.

15:45.610 --> 15:46.634
So he is here.

15:46.640 --> 15:48.460
I'm checking the hotels
in the area.

15:48.480 --> 15:50.209
You won't find
anything out there.

15:50.210 --> 15:51.109
He's too smart.

15:51.110 --> 15:53.841
I know,
but it's worth checking.

15:53.850 --> 15:56.672
Yeah. Thanks.

16:11.270 --> 16:12.863
"They were cute together...

16:12.870 --> 16:14.520
Before she tried
to kill him!"

16:14.540 --> 16:17.134
Aside from learning
way more than I want to

16:17.140 --> 16:18.960
Know about
liam hemsworth?

16:18.970 --> 16:20.904
He's australian,
he's hot.

16:20.910 --> 16:23.732
What more do you
need to know?

16:28.950 --> 16:32.614
"Death
in the afternoon.”

16:32.620 --> 16:35.612
It's the alias of a commenter
on jenny's facebook.

16:35.620 --> 16:38.089
Seems to have
a thing for her.

16:39.990 --> 16:42.220
The language is
sexually aggressive.

16:42.230 --> 16:43.356
And he made this.

16:43.370 --> 16:45.589
It's an online shrine
to jenny.

16:45.600 --> 16:49.264
Posted anonymously by
death in the afternoon.

16:49.270 --> 16:50.669
Jenny has a secret crush.

16:50.670 --> 16:53.332
Who?
Death in the afternoon.

16:53.340 --> 16:54.967
Hemingway.
What?

16:54.980 --> 16:58.336
Ernest hemingway wrote
"death in the afternoon."

16:58.750 --> 17:04.108
Ian hemingway. That's
one of emmet's friends.

17:16.130 --> 17:19.327
Ohh! You might want to
pick up your head there, son.

17:19.329 --> 17:20.819
It's all over
that wall.

17:20.839 --> 17:21.864
[knock on door]

17:21.869 --> 17:22.962
Ian, the cops are here.

17:22.970 --> 17:24.368
They say you didn't
do anything wrong.

17:24.369 --> 17:27.031
Just answer
their questions.

17:29.080 --> 17:30.309
Mr. Hemingway.

17:30.310 --> 17:31.937
Ah.
Detective larsen.

17:31.950 --> 17:35.045
He's detective larsen.
I'm detective lawrence.

17:35.050 --> 17:36.415
Right. Did you do
that on purpose,

17:36.420 --> 17:39.117
Mix up our names in an
attempt to mess with me?

17:39.120 --> 17:43.512
We found your
online shrine to jenny.

17:43.530 --> 17:44.759
Creepy.

17:44.760 --> 17:46.626
Look. I'm sorry. I don't
know what you guys

17:46.630 --> 17:47.529
Are talking about.

17:47.530 --> 17:48.452
Death in the afternoon.

17:48.460 --> 17:50.349
Your literary reference
is admirable

17:50.370 --> 17:51.223
But slightly obvious.

17:51.230 --> 17:52.959
And your ip address was
easy to track.

17:52.970 --> 17:56.361
All right. Look. I made
that page a long time ago.

17:56.370 --> 17:58.805
You still feel that way
about jenny?

17:58.810 --> 18:00.130
What way?
Obsessive,

18:00.140 --> 18:02.074
Sexually aggressive.

18:02.080 --> 18:04.777
Emmet gets pushed
down a ravine, can't play.

18:04.780 --> 18:07.704
The coach who picked him's
out of the picture.

18:07.720 --> 18:10.212
Who takes
emmet's place?

18:10.220 --> 18:13.144
You're starting
this Friday, right?

18:13.150 --> 18:15.653
You make it sound
like the plot of a movie.

18:15.660 --> 18:16.912
Do you watch
a lot of movies?

18:16.930 --> 18:19.456
No. Um, yes. Look.

18:19.460 --> 18:21.451
You guys are freaking
me out, all right?

18:21.460 --> 18:23.554
I liked jenny.
I'm over it.

18:23.570 --> 18:25.720
You're the one who told
jenny where to find

18:25.730 --> 18:28.119
Well, yeah, because
she needs to know

18:28.140 --> 18:28.993
He's an ass.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.264
See? That sounds like
you still care.

18:31.270 --> 18:32.305
Uh-huh.

18:32.310 --> 18:33.061
[sighs]

18:33.070 --> 18:34.401
I'm not your guy.

18:34.410 --> 18:36.105
I'll take down the
stupid tumblr page,

18:36.110 --> 18:39.171
But you guys got me
all wrong.

18:43.480 --> 18:46.450
[music playing]

18:46.450 --> 18:48.043
[ding]

18:48.060 --> 18:49.357
Someone just posted
on the "tattler"

18:49.360 --> 18:54.230
That you are pregnant
with coach baker's love child.

18:56.060 --> 18:58.757
"The pacific canyon
juno.”

18:58.770 --> 19:02.934
That's the dumbest thing
they've posted so far.

19:02.940 --> 19:04.465
Mrs. Kline: Sorry I'm late.

19:04.470 --> 19:05.835
I've got dinner.

19:05.840 --> 19:07.365
Can alexis stay?

19:07.380 --> 19:09.303
Of course. Hey, alexis.

19:09.310 --> 19:10.402
Hi.

19:10.410 --> 19:13.607
You girls getting
some good studying done?

19:14.850 --> 19:16.375
Who's that?

19:16.380 --> 19:17.279
Why?

19:17.290 --> 19:18.348
Just wondering.

19:18.350 --> 19:19.442
You're prying.

19:19.450 --> 19:20.440
I'm not prying.

19:20.460 --> 19:22.519
I'm allowed to know
what you're up to.

19:22.520 --> 19:24.579
Because you don't
trust me.

19:24.590 --> 19:25.660
I didn't say that.

19:25.660 --> 19:27.082
You didn't have to.

19:27.100 --> 19:29.899
Can you give us
some privacy, please?

19:32.270 --> 19:33.920
Fine.

19:33.940 --> 19:36.432
Food's in the kitchen.

19:45.850 --> 19:47.340
How do you like
that, jenny?

19:47.350 --> 19:49.910
Have I been
a bad girl, coach baker?

19:49.920 --> 19:51.217
Yes, you have,

19:51.220 --> 19:54.417
And I'm gonna
teach you a lesson.

19:54.420 --> 19:56.980
What is that?

19:56.990 --> 19:58.389
[Kissing]

19:58.390 --> 20:02.224
No! No!

20:02.230 --> 20:04.198
Why are they
doing this?

20:04.200 --> 20:05.964
Who did this?

20:05.970 --> 20:07.529
Mrs. Kline:
What's wrong?

20:07.540 --> 20:09.338
Baker: Bad, jenny.

20:09.340 --> 20:13.436
<i>That's not me.
That's not me!</i>

20:13.440 --> 20:15.875
No! No!

20:24.180 --> 20:25.409
Have I been
a bad girl, coach baker?

20:25.420 --> 20:27.946
Ugh. Ok. That's--
that's me,

20:27.960 --> 20:29.553
But that's not
jenny Kline.

20:29.560 --> 20:31.915
You call her by name
in the video.

20:31.930 --> 20:34.627
That woman's name was
also jenny.

20:34.630 --> 20:35.859
This was
a few months ago.

20:35.860 --> 20:38.454
I-I met her at this sports
bar where I hang out.

20:38.470 --> 20:40.996
We had a few drinks,
got to talking,

20:41.000 --> 20:42.866
And then the next you
know, we're a motel.

20:42.870 --> 20:44.759
You videotaped
the encounter?

20:44.770 --> 20:47.432
I didn't know this video
existed until this morning.

20:47.440 --> 20:50.000
So all this stuff about
you teaching her a lesson?

20:50.010 --> 20:51.705
We were role playing.

20:51.710 --> 20:53.178
She knew I worked
at a high school.

20:53.180 --> 20:55.171
She thought it would
be sexy.

20:55.180 --> 20:56.875
You get her last name?

20:56.880 --> 21:00.248
What about an address,
a phone number, something?

21:00.260 --> 21:01.409
No. I went
to her motel room, ok?

21:01.420 --> 21:02.717
She--she was from
out of town.

21:02.720 --> 21:04.017
Said she was
here on business.

21:04.030 --> 21:05.213
What kind of business?

21:05.230 --> 21:06.584
I didn't ask.

21:06.590 --> 21:09.025
Look. I was drunk, ok?

21:09.030 --> 21:10.452
But she wasn't a kid.

21:10.470 --> 21:13.963
She was--she was older,
probably my age.

21:13.970 --> 21:16.860
It was on lincoln
in venice.

21:16.870 --> 21:21.569
Um... The, uh,
the seaside something.

21:21.580 --> 21:24.106
View or vista,
something like that.

21:24.110 --> 21:25.509
Look. I didn't do
anything wrong, ok?

21:25.510 --> 21:28.605
This was sex between
two consenting adults.

21:34.220 --> 21:35.142
What do you think?

21:35.160 --> 21:36.514
He's sticking
to his story.

21:36.520 --> 21:38.511
No way he does that if
they're sexually involved.

21:38.530 --> 21:40.680
And jenny insists that
it's not her in the video,

21:40.700 --> 21:43.419
But they both have
good reasons to lie.

21:43.430 --> 21:45.421
So we're back
to a third party.

21:45.430 --> 21:47.159
If the woman in the video
isn't jenny,

21:47.170 --> 21:48.763
Then there's a good chance
that she's our stalker.

21:48.770 --> 21:50.067
Well, one thing
we know for sure--

21:50.070 --> 21:51.765
She's trying to ruin her,
making everyone think

21:51.770 --> 21:53.260
She's sleeping
with coach baker.

21:53.270 --> 21:55.830
Why didn't they release
the video sooner then?

21:55.840 --> 21:58.707
If it's fake, you disprove
it, and it goes away,

21:58.710 --> 21:59.848
But if you start
with a rumor,

21:59.850 --> 22:02.069
It doesn't matter if
the video's real or not.

22:02.080 --> 22:03.616
People have already
made up their minds.

22:03.620 --> 22:06.783
I'll check the motel. Maybe
they got a name or a credit card.

22:06.790 --> 22:07.518
Ok.

22:07.520 --> 22:09.579
[cell phone chimes]

22:09.590 --> 22:12.958
Ben just found the
source of the video.

22:12.960 --> 22:14.519
Guess who leaked it.

22:14.530 --> 22:15.827
Beth, voice-over:
We know the video

22:15.830 --> 22:17.753
Of coach baker and the
woman came from you.

22:17.770 --> 22:21.320
Or someone who
wants it to look like jenny.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.092
So why are you
talking to me?

22:23.100 --> 22:24.397
You should be talking
to tripp.

22:24.410 --> 22:26.060
He's the "pc tattler.”

22:26.070 --> 22:26.866
He posted it.

22:26.870 --> 22:27.837
We did talk
to tripp.

22:27.840 --> 22:29.433
He said you e-mailed
him the video.

22:29.440 --> 22:31.431
Well, maybe I thought
it was time that people knew

22:31.450 --> 22:32.599
What jenny
was really like.

22:32.610 --> 22:34.203
And what is she
like, dierdre?

22:34.220 --> 22:35.676
A liar and a fake.

22:35.680 --> 22:38.741
She wants people to think
that she's this perfect person.

22:38.750 --> 22:40.479
The second you turn
your back,

22:40.490 --> 22:41.719
She stabs you
in the heart.

22:41.720 --> 22:45.725
Does this have something
to do with emmet?

22:45.730 --> 22:47.220
I told her
I liked him.

22:47.230 --> 22:49.995
She knew how I felt, and
she went after him anyway.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.889
So you stole him
to hurt her.

22:51.900 --> 22:56.838
No. Emmet and I
belong together.

22:56.840 --> 23:01.061
What color was your
hair before you dyed it?

23:01.080 --> 23:02.900
It was brunette, right?

23:02.910 --> 23:04.105
I saw some pictures
of you.

23:04.110 --> 23:06.078
They were taken
a couple weeks ago.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.343
You were brunette.

23:07.350 --> 23:10.240
Y-you think that it
was me with coach baker?

23:10.250 --> 23:13.083
Well, the video's dark,
and you and jenny have

23:13.090 --> 23:15.309
Very similar body types.

23:15.320 --> 23:17.254
You're crazy.

23:17.260 --> 23:18.682
Just ask coach baker.

23:18.690 --> 23:22.399
He'll tell you that
it wasn't me.

23:22.400 --> 23:25.859
I posted it, ok,

23:25.870 --> 23:27.019
But I didn't shoot it.

23:27.030 --> 23:28.794
Where did you get
the video, dierdre?

23:28.800 --> 23:33.738
Off of a thumb drive that
somebody left in my locker.

23:33.740 --> 23:36.630
Look. I'm not lying,
I swear.

23:36.640 --> 23:38.278
Here.

23:44.550 --> 23:47.747
[keys rattling in door]

23:49.690 --> 23:51.954
Where have you been?

23:53.190 --> 23:56.160
I wanted a haircut.

23:56.160 --> 23:57.628
I see that.

23:57.630 --> 23:58.722
Yeah. You were
in the shower,

23:58.730 --> 24:00.459
So I went for a walk,
you know?

24:00.470 --> 24:01.892
I was going
a little stir crazy.

24:01.900 --> 24:03.265
You can't just
leave like that.

24:03.270 --> 24:04.669
What if someone
recognized you?

24:04.670 --> 24:07.207
No one did. I was
locked up for 12 years.

24:07.210 --> 24:09.531
You know, I needed
a little fresh air.

24:09.540 --> 24:11.634
Do you have any idea
how stupid that sounds?

24:11.650 --> 24:12.947
We need to be careful.

24:12.950 --> 24:13.974
Unh!

24:13.980 --> 24:14.902
What?

24:14.920 --> 24:17.844
[grunting]

24:21.090 --> 24:25.288
You have
too many rules.

24:27.060 --> 24:29.392
I'm sorry.

24:29.400 --> 24:32.222
Uh, that's just something
that happens to me.

24:32.230 --> 24:37.191
Sometimes, I just--
I lose it.

24:44.140 --> 24:46.472
Come on.

24:46.480 --> 24:48.574
I'm sorry.

24:58.230 --> 25:00.085
It's ok.

25:00.090 --> 25:01.455
I shouldn't have
yelled.

25:01.460 --> 25:03.895
I just think that you're
under the impression

25:03.900 --> 25:07.120
That you're
in control here.

25:13.410 --> 25:19.349
And I think that we have
to work together, you know?

25:19.350 --> 25:23.571
I need this to be
a partnership, perry.

25:23.580 --> 25:25.742
It is.

25:25.750 --> 25:26.911
Good.

25:26.920 --> 25:30.083
Because it wasn't
feeling like that.

25:37.330 --> 25:41.790
Heh. Emmet says he's
getting out of the hospital.

25:41.800 --> 25:45.134
Jenny, lieutenant davis
told you not contact him.

25:45.140 --> 25:46.562
Yeah. I was
just saying hi.

25:46.570 --> 25:48.299
But, honey, with
everything that's going on,

25:48.310 --> 25:51.007
I-I don't think
that's a good idea.

25:51.010 --> 25:53.206
But I haven't done
anything.

25:53.210 --> 25:54.678
Why am I the one
being punished?

25:54.680 --> 25:57.320
Ok. I'm not gonna discuss
this with you anymore.

25:57.320 --> 25:59.482
You should probably go
start your homework, ok?

25:59.490 --> 26:00.412
What's the point?

26:00.420 --> 26:03.117
I'm never going back
to that school.

26:03.120 --> 26:04.679
We're gonna get
through this.

26:04.690 --> 26:07.489
This is all gonna
blow over eventually.

26:07.500 --> 26:09.889
This kind of stuff
does not blow over.

26:09.900 --> 26:13.723
It becomes forever.
Everyone hates me.

26:13.730 --> 26:18.600
I know it feels like
the sky is falling now.

26:18.610 --> 26:20.066
We have to move, mom.

26:20.070 --> 26:21.231
I can't go back there.

26:21.240 --> 26:23.880
Well, babe, I can't
just quit my job.

26:23.880 --> 26:27.202
I know how hard this
has been on you.

26:27.210 --> 26:30.145
It's horrible
what's happened,

26:30.150 --> 26:34.189
But you can't run away
from your problems.

26:34.190 --> 26:35.885
You got to deal
with them.

26:35.890 --> 26:38.313
Mom, my life here
is over.

26:38.330 --> 26:41.152
People think I'm
a slut.

26:41.160 --> 26:44.027
Well, then the best way
to change their minds

26:44.030 --> 26:46.362
Is to show them
that you're not

26:46.370 --> 26:49.123
The person that they
think you are.

26:49.140 --> 26:51.632
You don't even care.

26:52.910 --> 26:56.699
Of course I...Do.
I care.

27:09.420 --> 27:12.082
What'd you say
to them? Huh?

27:12.090 --> 27:15.128
What did you say
to them, huh?

27:15.130 --> 27:16.291
Leave me alone!

27:16.300 --> 27:17.392
What did you say?

27:17.400 --> 27:18.652
[banging on window]

27:18.670 --> 27:19.592
Please go away!

27:19.600 --> 27:21.489
You ruined my life,
you little bitch.

27:21.500 --> 27:24.037
Leave me alone. Aah!

27:24.040 --> 27:25.394
[engine starts]

27:25.410 --> 27:28.004
Where do you think
you're going?

27:29.510 --> 27:34.209
Get out of the car!
Get out of the--

27:42.820 --> 27:44.185
[knock on door]

27:44.190 --> 27:45.988
Coach baker got
drunk last night,

27:45.990 --> 27:49.051
Showed up at jenny's
house and went after her.

27:49.060 --> 27:49.993
Is jenny ok?

27:50.000 --> 27:51.456
She's fine. Her
mother called the cops,

27:51.470 --> 27:53.495
Baker got arrested, and
the school suspended him

27:53.500 --> 27:55.525
Pending the outcome
of the case.

27:55.540 --> 27:56.792
Baker's collateral damage.

27:56.800 --> 27:57.699
He's a popular guy.

27:57.710 --> 28:00.236
So you think our
stalker planned this?

28:00.240 --> 28:02.561
Well, either way,
dierdre's responsible.

28:02.580 --> 28:04.332
I mean, she's the one
who posted the video.

28:04.350 --> 28:05.932
That just proves she's
a cyber bully, not a stalker.

28:05.950 --> 28:08.169
Did forensics find anything
on that thumb drive?

28:08.180 --> 28:10.012
No, nothing.
It's clean.

28:10.020 --> 28:12.910
I tracked the mystery woman
from the motel video.

28:12.920 --> 28:14.615
She registered
under rheanna erichs.

28:14.620 --> 28:15.917
Is that a fake name?
It's possible.

28:15.920 --> 28:18.651
Ben ran it through our
database, as well as dmv--

28:18.660 --> 28:19.889
No hits yet.

28:19.890 --> 28:22.825
Maybe not. Rheanna called
a cab from the room.

28:22.830 --> 28:23.991
According
to company records,

28:24.000 --> 28:26.219
The driver dropped her off
near temescal canyon.

28:26.230 --> 28:27.868
That's not far
from the abandoned house

28:27.870 --> 28:29.736
Where emmet
was attacked.

28:29.740 --> 28:31.799
That's not
a coincidence.

28:31.810 --> 28:33.835
Janice, let's
check it out.

28:34.740 --> 28:38.131
Girl: Hashtag
ho in a hat.

28:38.150 --> 28:39.970
Hey. Here you go.

28:39.980 --> 28:41.744
This is everything
from your locker.

28:41.750 --> 28:42.876
Thanks.

28:42.880 --> 28:44.609
No problem.

28:44.620 --> 28:47.840
What do I tell
your mom if she calls?

28:47.860 --> 28:49.248
You haven't seen me.

28:49.260 --> 28:52.184
You don't know
where I am.

28:52.190 --> 28:54.124
Where will you go?

28:54.130 --> 28:56.758
Doesn't matter.

28:56.760 --> 28:59.559
I can't stay here.

28:59.570 --> 29:01.891
Your mom's gonna lose
it when she finds out.

29:01.900 --> 29:04.767
No. She doesn't
even believe me.

29:04.770 --> 29:08.638
She thinks I'm behind
all this. I can tell.

29:08.640 --> 29:11.007
I'm gonna miss
you, jenn.

29:11.010 --> 29:12.808
You, too, lex.

29:12.810 --> 29:15.472
[bell ringing]

30:43.040 --> 30:45.099
<i>Janice!</i>

30:50.840 --> 30:52.205
Someone's been
squatting here.

30:52.210 --> 30:56.477
Yeah. Judging by the
clothes, it looks like a teenager.

31:00.850 --> 31:03.751
I recognize this.

31:03.760 --> 31:05.080
From the video.

31:05.090 --> 31:09.049
Our squatter is the mystery
woman with coach baker?

31:09.060 --> 31:11.358
Ok, but who is she?

31:11.370 --> 31:13.998
What's her connection
to jenny?

31:19.610 --> 31:23.205
Rheanna's got a friend
on the basketball team.

31:23.210 --> 31:25.531
Number 4.

31:25.550 --> 31:27.939
It's ian hemingway.

31:27.950 --> 31:29.873
I don't know anyone
named rheanna erichs.

31:29.880 --> 31:31.712
So how did she get
your practice jersey?

31:31.720 --> 31:33.586
Beats me.
Maybe she stole it.

31:33.590 --> 31:34.842
Maybe you gave it
to her.

31:34.860 --> 31:36.043
Why would I do that?

31:36.060 --> 31:37.084
She was cold.

31:37.090 --> 31:38.979
Look. If I were hooking up
with this chick,

31:38.990 --> 31:40.480
I think I would
know her name.

31:40.490 --> 31:42.026
Well, maybe you
never asked her,

31:42.030 --> 31:43.100
Or maybe she lied
to you.

31:43.100 --> 31:44.352
You're holding
back, ian.

31:44.370 --> 31:46.862
Your lips are dry, you're
scratching your neck red.

31:46.870 --> 31:49.020
Talk to me. Who have
you been seeing?

31:49.040 --> 31:50.337
That's private,
all right?

31:50.340 --> 31:51.694
I don't have to
tell you anything.

31:51.710 --> 31:53.337
No, you don't, but if you
don't give me a name,

31:53.340 --> 31:55.661
We'll have to charge
you as an accessory.

31:55.680 --> 31:56.806
To what?
Attempted murder,

31:56.810 --> 31:58.699
Cyber bullying, harassment,
criminal stalking.

31:58.710 --> 32:01.077
All right, all right.
You name it!

32:05.690 --> 32:10.719
Me and alexis have
been hooking up.

32:10.720 --> 32:13.121
Alexis palmer?

32:13.130 --> 32:14.325
Jenny's best friend?

32:14.330 --> 32:17.129
Yeah. Jenny and I don't
exactly get along,

32:17.130 --> 32:19.622
So alexis wanted to
keep it a secret.

32:19.630 --> 32:21.689
Where would
you two meet?

32:21.700 --> 32:22.826
Meet right here.

32:22.840 --> 32:25.195
She sneaks in
after my mom goes to bed

32:25.210 --> 32:27.907
And slips out
before she wakes up.

32:27.910 --> 32:30.106
Have you ever been
to her house?

32:30.110 --> 32:31.134
Do you know
where she lives?

32:31.150 --> 32:35.576
No. Uh...
It never came up.

32:35.580 --> 32:37.776
Ben: Rheanna erichs' name
popped up

32:37.790 --> 32:39.986
In the social services
database.

32:39.990 --> 32:41.947
She's a foster kid.

32:42.760 --> 32:44.888
She's been in the system
her entire life.

32:44.890 --> 32:47.382
Looks like she just bounced
from one home to another

32:47.390 --> 32:49.722
Until she finally
aged out.

32:49.730 --> 32:51.220
How old is she?

32:51.230 --> 32:52.823
21.

32:56.440 --> 32:58.090
That's alexis.

32:58.110 --> 32:59.293
Alexis is
rheanna erichs?

32:59.310 --> 33:01.165
But rheanna's
21 years old.

33:01.180 --> 33:02.261
Why is she
pretending and going

33:02.280 --> 33:03.634
After
a high-school girl?

33:03.640 --> 33:04.801
Rheanna never had
a family.

33:04.810 --> 33:06.539
Jenny got adopted,
she got lucky.

33:06.550 --> 33:07.904
Could be jealous,
but why jenny?

33:07.920 --> 33:09.740
I mean, there are a million
adopted kids out there,

33:09.750 --> 33:12.447
And you certainly wouldn't
go to those lengths.

33:12.450 --> 33:15.340
Because they have
the same mother.

33:15.360 --> 33:18.182
Rheanna's records
list her birth mother

33:18.190 --> 33:19.180
As monica graham.

33:19.190 --> 33:20.225
Ben: Jenny's mother.

33:20.230 --> 33:22.153
I'm betting graham
is her maiden name.

33:22.160 --> 33:24.527
So jenny's mom is
alexis' biological mother?

33:24.530 --> 33:26.919
Who she gave up
21 years ago.

33:26.930 --> 33:28.762
This is revenge
stalking.

33:28.770 --> 33:31.398
Or restitution.

33:47.350 --> 33:49.239
[sighs]

33:52.230 --> 33:54.688
[door opens and shuts]

33:54.700 --> 33:58.330
Jenny? Honey,
is that you?

34:03.970 --> 34:08.304
You can't just
ignore my texts.

34:12.850 --> 34:16.342
Honey, we have to talk.

34:17.620 --> 34:20.089
Jenny.

34:23.020 --> 34:25.079
Oh! Heh.

34:25.090 --> 34:26.922
Alexis.

34:28.659 --> 34:30.924
Hi, mom.

34:38.400 --> 34:40.266
Mrs. Kline, it's
detective lawrence.

34:40.270 --> 34:41.567
I'm trying to
track down jenny.

34:41.580 --> 34:43.605
Please call me.
It's urgent. I'll try at home.

34:43.610 --> 34:44.975
Jack: So alexis ages
out of the system.

34:44.980 --> 34:47.277
She goes looking for the
stability she never had before.

34:47.280 --> 34:48.509
She goes looking
for her mother.

34:48.520 --> 34:51.876
She's smart, adept at
concealing her emotional state.

34:51.889 --> 34:53.641
Could be borderline
personality disorder.

34:53.650 --> 34:56.620
She's driven by her desire
to reconnect with monica,

34:56.620 --> 34:58.213
And jenny's an impediment
to that connection.

34:58.230 --> 34:59.459
So she sets out
to get rid of her.

34:59.460 --> 35:01.280
Frames her for trying
to harm coach baker.

35:01.300 --> 35:03.689
Hurts emmet, makes
jenny look unhinged.

35:03.700 --> 35:04.849
Alexis was
behind everything.

35:04.870 --> 35:07.225
She used dierdre to
disseminate the video,

35:07.230 --> 35:09.119
And the high-school
rumor mill did the rest.

35:09.140 --> 35:11.461
Alexis succeeded
in destroying jenny's life.

35:11.470 --> 35:13.302
Her mother will welcome
a new daughter now.

35:13.310 --> 35:14.562
It's time
for an introduction.

35:14.580 --> 35:16.207
In her crazed thinking,
she'll be accepted.

35:16.210 --> 35:18.076
Janice: I can't reach
jenny or her mother!

35:18.080 --> 35:20.640
Send a unit
to monica's house!

35:20.650 --> 35:21.606
Let's go.

35:21.620 --> 35:24.715
[telephone ringing]

35:24.720 --> 35:27.519
What's the matter,
mom?

35:27.520 --> 35:29.989
You don't
recognize me?

35:29.990 --> 35:32.914
I know it's been
a long time.

35:32.930 --> 35:35.627
My entire life.

35:35.630 --> 35:39.021
It can't be.

35:39.030 --> 35:41.192
I'm your daughter.

35:41.200 --> 35:44.261
Whatever stand-ins
you had before me,

35:44.270 --> 35:46.932
I won't let them
separate us again.

35:46.940 --> 35:50.478
Oh, honey.

35:50.480 --> 35:54.075
Nobody separated us.

35:54.080 --> 35:56.879
I was too young.

35:56.880 --> 36:00.418
I wasn't ready
to become a mother.

36:00.420 --> 36:04.653
It was the hardest
thing I ever had to do,

36:04.660 --> 36:10.520
But I just--I just wanted
what was best for you.

36:10.530 --> 36:12.328
So you replaced me?

36:12.330 --> 36:15.220
Ohh. It doesn't
work that way.

36:15.240 --> 36:18.733
You can't replace
a child,

36:18.740 --> 36:22.563
And I looked
for you for years,

36:22.580 --> 36:24.833
But the foster records,
they were incomplete.

36:24.850 --> 36:28.844
They were never, ever able
to tell me where you were.

36:28.850 --> 36:30.579
You looked for me?

36:30.580 --> 36:33.880
Of course I did.

36:33.890 --> 36:37.053
Oh. They told me the
records were destroyed.

36:37.060 --> 36:39.586
I looked
for you, too,

36:39.590 --> 36:42.082
And I found you,

36:42.100 --> 36:44.558
And now that
jenny's gone,

36:44.570 --> 36:47.995
We can start over.

36:48.000 --> 36:48.967
What do you--

36:48.970 --> 36:50.392
The closer I got
to jenny,

36:50.400 --> 36:52.334
The more I got
to be with you.

36:52.340 --> 36:56.504
You made me feel like
part of a family.

36:56.510 --> 36:58.535
Alexis, where's jenny?

36:58.550 --> 37:00.075
My name's rheanna.

37:00.080 --> 37:01.309
Where's my daughter?

37:01.320 --> 37:02.970
I'm your daughter.

37:02.980 --> 37:04.709
Jenny: Mom?

37:05.890 --> 37:08.143
What's going on?

37:08.160 --> 37:11.516
You aren't supposed
to be here.

37:11.530 --> 37:13.726
I couldn't go
through with it.

37:13.730 --> 37:14.720
Go through with what?

37:14.730 --> 37:16.721
She was supposed
to leave

37:16.730 --> 37:19.199
Because she
doesn't love you.

37:19.200 --> 37:20.224
I'm sorry, mom.

37:20.230 --> 37:21.789
I was mad.
It was stupid.

37:21.800 --> 37:23.199
You don't
deserve her.

37:23.200 --> 37:25.430
After everything
you've done?

37:25.440 --> 37:30.002
Lex, what's going on?

37:30.010 --> 37:32.229
It was you.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.241
This entire time.

37:34.250 --> 37:36.878
Oh, my god.

37:41.950 --> 37:43.281
Aah!

37:43.290 --> 37:46.214
Aah!

37:46.230 --> 37:49.188
No! No!

37:49.200 --> 37:50.656
Aah!

37:50.660 --> 37:52.697
Alexis, stop it!

37:52.700 --> 37:54.896
Leave her alone!

37:54.900 --> 37:57.892
[screaming]

37:59.310 --> 38:01.631
No! Jenny!

38:01.640 --> 38:04.337
Jenny! Oh, my god.

38:04.340 --> 38:06.331
Jenny! Jenny!

38:06.350 --> 38:09.103
Honey. OK.
It's ok.

38:09.120 --> 38:12.010
Look at me.
Look at me.

38:12.020 --> 38:14.318
Oh, no. Please.

38:14.320 --> 38:16.209
Mom?

38:16.220 --> 38:17.949
Are you ok?

38:17.960 --> 38:20.884
I'm right here,
sweetheart.

38:20.890 --> 38:22.426
I am.

38:22.430 --> 38:25.821
[cameras clicking]

38:32.810 --> 38:36.166
[radio chatter]

38:51.490 --> 38:54.255
Why would she pretend
to be my friend?

38:54.260 --> 38:58.197
Why would she do
all those things?

38:58.200 --> 38:59.759
She's not well.

38:59.770 --> 39:04.332
Aw, honey, I'm--I'm
SO sorry.

39:07.210 --> 39:10.271
Is it true. Is...

39:10.280 --> 39:13.602
Is she really
my daughter?

39:13.610 --> 39:15.374
Yeah.

39:16.320 --> 39:18.618
What's going to
happen to her?

39:18.620 --> 39:20.941
She'll be admitted
to a psychiatric facility

39:20.950 --> 39:22.714
For observation.

39:22.720 --> 39:25.018
I did this to her.

39:25.030 --> 39:25.986
No, you didn't.

39:25.990 --> 39:29.085
Would it be possible
if I wanted to see her?

39:29.100 --> 39:32.058
I mean, would that
help anything?

39:32.070 --> 39:33.253
You would do that?

39:33.270 --> 39:34.965
Is that something
you want to do?

39:34.970 --> 39:36.938
I don't know.

39:36.940 --> 39:41.502
Maybe we could
one day.

39:43.480 --> 39:45.335
It's ok.

39:47.310 --> 39:49.642
It's gonna be fine, ok?

40:00.230 --> 40:02.153
Good job
on this one, guys.

40:02.160 --> 40:04.026
How about food?
I'm starving.

40:04.030 --> 40:07.000
Let's go.
I'll drive.

40:08.970 --> 40:10.165
I'm buying.

40:10.170 --> 40:12.036
I'm eating.

40:30.290 --> 40:32.258
[camera shutter clicks]

40:37.530 --> 40:40.693
[keys rattling in door]

40:44.940 --> 40:48.035
I know you're awake.

40:48.040 --> 40:50.134
Get up.

40:52.550 --> 40:54.370
Where have you been?

40:54.380 --> 40:56.474
To see her.

40:58.380 --> 40:59.711
What'd you do?

40:59.720 --> 41:03.418
Nothing,
but I have a plan

41:03.420 --> 41:06.390
To get michelle back.

41:09.060 --> 41:11.199
We have to
make her vulnerable.

41:11.200 --> 41:13.999
We have to take away
her family.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.196
You already did that.
You killed them.

41:16.200 --> 41:21.070
Uh-uh. I'm talking about
her new family here in |.A.,

41:21.070 --> 41:22.538
Her work.

41:22.540 --> 41:24.736
It's all she
cares about.

41:37.220 --> 41:39.518
We have to destroy
her world,

41:39.530 --> 41:44.400
Make it so the only
place she can turn to is us.

41:44.400 --> 41:47.165
We got to start
with those closest.

41:47.170 --> 41:51.459
We got to start
with these people.

41:57.340 --> 41:59.172
Heh.
