00:27.450 --> 00:31.884
VO: Here we stand,
on the shoulders of giants.

00:31.950 --> 00:33.730
These are our words

00:33.820 --> 00:37.984
and our sacred charge.

00:38.050 --> 00:41.594
Greatness is the foundation of our world.

00:41.660 --> 00:44.704
Greatness let us survive
centuries of strife.

00:44.770 --> 00:46.814
Tame the world to our will,

00:46.880 --> 00:51.284
and spread across the stars
at the speed of light.

00:51.350 --> 00:54.730
That same greatness may be in you.

00:54.900 --> 00:58.850
Now it's time to find out.

00:59.420 --> 01:01.640
Your Academies have nominated you

01:01.730 --> 01:02.884
for your ambition,

01:02.950 --> 01:06.434
your drive, your potential for greatness.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.734
It's time to prove yourself worthy

01:08.800 --> 01:13.800
in the Sol Invictus games...

01:14.600 --> 01:17.784
You and your team will
be cast across the stars

01:17.850 --> 01:19.284
to a pre-selected planet.

01:19.350 --> 01:22.134
Your mission is a race against time

01:22.200 --> 01:24.534
and a triumph of will.

01:24.600 --> 01:26.534
You are to set up camp

01:26.600 --> 01:28.770
establish a foothold for your Academy

01:28.880 --> 01:32.154
and use all the tools at your disposal.

01:32.220 --> 01:35.084
You are to search the sky and pinpoint

01:35.150 --> 01:37.084
out of all the stars in the sky

01:37.150 --> 01:42.400
which is Earth's sun: Sol.

01:47.600 --> 01:50.284
But be warned: only one team can win

01:50.350 --> 01:53.134
and each Academy has sent their best

01:53.200 --> 01:55.934
and brightest to compete against you.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.260
Your team Captain will lead you.

01:58.330 --> 02:00.484
Your Astronomer will search the skies.

02:00.550 --> 02:02.770
And your team must form a cohesive unit

02:02.840 --> 02:05.214
to have any hope of victory.

02:05.280 --> 02:10.334
We're strong together, broken apart.

02:10.400 --> 02:13.534
Eternal glory awaits the winner.

02:13.600 --> 02:15.794
Use all the tools and wits you have

02:15.860 --> 02:17.684
to prove your greatness.

02:17.750 --> 02:19.534
But move quickly.

02:19.600 --> 02:22.784
Only the victorious team may return home.

02:22.850 --> 02:25.684
The cosmos are dark and dangerous.

02:25.750 --> 02:29.450
There's no room for mediocrity.

02:30.350 --> 02:34.084
Return a champion or not at all.

02:34.150 --> 02:37.734
Winning is the only rule.

02:40.680 --> 02:43.684
VO: Welcome to Sol Invictus...

02:52.700 --> 02:54.434
We have to turn it off!

02:54.500 --> 02:56.084
What about the rest of them?

02:56.150 --> 02:58.080
They haven't made it out yet!

02:58.150 --> 03:01.420
Leave 'em! The Slip Gate's gonna collapse!

03:06.100 --> 03:08.100
I can fix this!

03:09.750 --> 03:12.034
Take this!

03:17.680 --> 03:18.864
They're still inside!

03:18.930 --> 03:21.020
Look out!

03:21.310 --> 03:22.984
That's all I can do!

03:23.050 --> 03:25.734
Clear out! Run!

03:57.200 --> 03:58.384
Okay listen up.

03:58.450 --> 04:00.134
Something must have happened to the gate.

04:00.200 --> 04:02.134
The rest of our teams haven't come through.

04:02.200 --> 04:05.200
Am I the only Team Captain?

04:05.820 --> 04:07.650
Eli?

04:08.400 --> 04:10.910
What are you doing here?

04:11.170 --> 04:12.844
I came out.

04:12.910 --> 04:14.584
With Virgo Academy.

04:14.650 --> 04:17.680
Is anyone here a Team Engineer?

04:18.080 --> 04:19.274
What's your name?

04:19.340 --> 04:22.104
Ira. From Aries Academy.

04:22.170 --> 04:24.170
Come with me.

04:39.970 --> 04:42.644
The rest of my team,
they hadn't come through yet!

04:42.710 --> 04:44.044
My brother was with them.

04:44.110 --> 04:46.044
Mine too. Listen to me, Ira.

04:46.110 --> 04:47.738
Can you get the rest of my team through?

04:47.805 --> 04:50.754
I don't know.
I've never worked a Slip Gate before.

04:50.820 --> 04:52.104
They don't teach us how.

04:52.170 --> 04:53.814
I need you to try. Try hard.

04:53.880 --> 04:56.570
I still have a competition to win.

04:58.020 --> 04:59.644
I think...

04:59.710 --> 05:02.044
I think it's broken on our end.

05:14.620 --> 05:15.934
Hey!

05:16.000 --> 05:17.444
Pick it up.

05:17.510 --> 05:19.014
What?

05:19.080 --> 05:21.620
You're a Team Chronicle.
You need to record this!

05:21.687 --> 05:22.874
There's nothing to record.

05:22.940 --> 05:24.874
My team didn't make it through.

05:24.940 --> 05:26.874
There's enough of my team to compete.

05:26.940 --> 05:29.754
We need a Chronicle to prove our win.

05:29.820 --> 05:31.154
You're one of us now, shrimp.

05:31.220 --> 05:32.244
My name's Kit!

05:32.310 --> 05:33.644
Kyle Ian Troy.

05:33.710 --> 05:36.984
Well now you're a Gemini, Kit.

05:37.050 --> 05:39.570
Now pick it up!

05:44.970 --> 05:47.000
Lee?

05:47.940 --> 05:50.244
What about the rest of them?

05:50.310 --> 05:52.244
Leave 'em.

05:52.310 --> 05:54.244
They're just dead weight.

05:54.310 --> 05:56.444
A lot of our team didn't make it through.

05:56.510 --> 05:59.074
We could use the extra hands.

05:59.140 --> 06:02.014
The rest of you, you're coming with us.

06:02.080 --> 06:04.904
You're all from Gemini now.

06:04.970 --> 06:07.850
I'm not on your team.

06:08.880 --> 06:10.644
Why should I follow you?

06:10.710 --> 06:12.214
Your teammates aren't coming.

06:12.280 --> 06:13.814
Face it.

06:13.880 --> 06:17.384
Come with us and you may
get credit as part of our team.

06:17.450 --> 06:19.444
Don't want to be one of us? Then stay.

06:19.510 --> 06:21.674
You can be our competition...

06:21.740 --> 06:23.880
Your call.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.134
This isn't right.

06:43.200 --> 06:46.354
The games are supposed
to be on a forest world.

06:46.420 --> 06:48.704
Make sure to include
that in your Chronicle.

06:48.770 --> 06:51.534
Judges won't believe this
unless they see proof.

06:51.600 --> 06:56.474
Maybe we'll get a special
honor for winning out here.

06:56.540 --> 06:59.554
Do you think this happened
to the girl's Games too?

06:59.620 --> 07:02.880
We'd have heard wouldn't we?

07:08.140 --> 07:11.674
If we're going to find Sol
first we need to set up,

07:11.740 --> 07:13.674
learn the area.

07:13.740 --> 07:15.674
Scouts, this way. Scour the place.

07:15.740 --> 07:17.740
Find anything that might be useful.

07:20.280 --> 07:22.044
I know you!

07:22.110 --> 07:23.874
You're the guy that won last year.

07:23.940 --> 07:25.754
You won Sol Invictus!

07:25.820 --> 07:29.474
But... You were disqualified weren't you?

07:29.540 --> 07:32.844
That's right! You were DQ'd for cheating.

07:32.910 --> 07:35.614
Must have been embarrassing
to have that taken away.

07:35.680 --> 07:37.614
I'd watch what I was saying

07:37.680 --> 07:40.334
if I didn't have my team here
to back me up...

07:40.400 --> 07:41.844
Maybe you should.

07:41.910 --> 07:45.000
You two, you know each other?

07:46.510 --> 07:47.534
We used to.

07:47.600 --> 07:48.584
What class are you?

07:48.650 --> 07:49.784
Astronomer.

07:49.850 --> 07:51.334
I'm Eli from Virgo.

07:51.400 --> 07:53.334
We've already got an Astronomer.

07:53.400 --> 07:55.334
Lee, should we drop this one?

07:55.400 --> 07:56.522
What about you?

07:56.589 --> 07:57.504
Me?

07:57.570 --> 07:59.044
You're scouts now.

07:59.110 --> 08:01.184
Find everything you can about this place.

08:01.250 --> 08:03.984
But we don't have weapons.
What if it's dangerous?

08:04.050 --> 08:05.984
Then you'll be the first to know.

08:06.050 --> 08:07.984
Strength in numbers, right?

08:08.050 --> 08:10.384
Rest of you scouts, let's move out!

08:10.450 --> 08:12.614
I want camp set up before sunset!

08:12.680 --> 08:16.280
We've got a lot of stars to search through.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.044
This could go on for miles.

08:23.110 --> 08:25.650
And I think the air is thinner out here.

08:32.740 --> 08:35.954
They're not going to send
any search parties.

08:36.020 --> 08:37.954
They don't send help.

08:38.020 --> 08:40.444
But we're on the wrong planet.
Won't they come looking?

08:40.510 --> 08:44.104
You sure they know something's wrong?

08:45.400 --> 08:47.334
Did you hear that? Listen...

08:51.458 --> 08:53.858
Eli, wait!

09:01.910 --> 09:04.154
An ocean?!

09:04.220 --> 09:07.310
I've never seen a real one before...

09:13.970 --> 09:17.074
How much do you think
this is worth back home?

09:17.140 --> 09:19.244
Hard to tell.

09:19.310 --> 09:21.554
It could go on forever.

09:21.620 --> 09:24.304
But it's fresh water that they need.

09:24.370 --> 09:27.274
What should we do about the Geminis?

09:27.340 --> 09:29.340
Should we run?

09:29.940 --> 09:32.200
Then what?

09:37.940 --> 09:39.554
Don't say that to me!

09:39.620 --> 09:41.554
What do you mean there's no food?

09:41.620 --> 09:42.814
You're the Chef.

09:42.880 --> 09:45.334
It's your job to make sure everyone is fed!

09:45.400 --> 09:47.334
I know that.

09:47.400 --> 09:50.540
It's just: all our food
was with the Porters.

09:51.650 --> 09:55.510
I've got a few essentials but nothing else.

09:57.200 --> 10:00.140
There's not enough for everyone...

11:07.634 --> 11:10.357
Kit! What are you doing?!
Record this!

11:20.900 --> 11:22.834
We have to go!

11:22.900 --> 11:25.084
If we get to water maybe they can't swim!

11:25.150 --> 11:27.054
I'm not going out there!

11:27.120 --> 11:28.774
If we get to the ocean we might make it!

11:28.840 --> 11:31.774
We can't make it!

13:19.380 --> 13:21.854
You made it! How?

13:21.920 --> 13:23.654
Spent the night in a tree.

13:23.720 --> 13:26.634
Those - whatever they are - hunters

13:26.700 --> 13:29.004
lost interest in me a few hours ago.

13:29.070 --> 13:32.100
Took the rest and left.

13:37.840 --> 13:39.804
It's still running!

13:42.410 --> 13:44.854
Maybe we can see... what happened.

13:44.920 --> 13:47.780
No one should see what those things do.

13:50.550 --> 13:52.804
Just the four of us?

13:52.870 --> 13:54.854
We're all that made it?

13:54.920 --> 13:56.514
What are you doing?!

13:56.580 --> 13:58.234
You can't just leave.

13:58.300 --> 14:00.574
Look what staying in a group
got the rest of them.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.604
I'm going solo.

14:02.670 --> 14:04.604
I got to camp first so this stuff is mine.

14:04.670 --> 14:06.604
That's not fair you were
the first to run too!

14:06.670 --> 14:07.684
This stuff is mine!

14:07.750 --> 14:09.114
You want to prove it, shrimp?

14:09.180 --> 14:10.204
My name is Kit!

14:10.270 --> 14:11.174
Keep quiet!

14:11.240 --> 14:13.174
We're not splitting up.

14:13.240 --> 14:16.914
If the Geminis can put
together a team so can we.

14:16.980 --> 14:19.514
They didn't know about
the Hunters but now we do.

14:19.580 --> 14:21.034
We don't even have half a team.

14:21.100 --> 14:23.314
You know the rules...

14:23.380 --> 14:27.974
There's still a team
as long as there's a Captain.

14:28.040 --> 14:29.974
I know the rules.

14:30.040 --> 14:32.374
You're an Astronomer.
I don't have to listen to you.

14:32.440 --> 14:34.750
Don't listen to me then.

14:35.550 --> 14:37.344
Listen to Tyl.

14:37.410 --> 14:40.150
He's the only Team Captain now.

14:43.750 --> 14:45.144
What are you doing!?

14:45.210 --> 14:48.284
I want as many eyes watching
my back as possible.

14:48.350 --> 14:50.884
The best chance we have
is if we stick together, right?

14:50.950 --> 14:52.144
Yeah but-

14:52.210 --> 14:54.434
Then you have to force them into a team!

14:54.500 --> 14:56.500
But I'm not a Captain!

15:04.010 --> 15:05.804
You are now.

15:05.870 --> 15:08.520
So start acting like it.

15:10.240 --> 15:11.834
The games are over!

15:11.900 --> 15:14.314
There's gotta be someone
here with a communicator.

15:14.380 --> 15:15.774
I'm calling home.

15:15.840 --> 15:18.174
If someone was out here
we'd have seen them.

15:18.240 --> 15:19.814
We're alone.

15:19.880 --> 15:21.414
Then what are we supposed to do?

15:21.480 --> 15:22.730
We still have a telescope.

15:22.820 --> 15:25.113
We followed the Geminis because
they were supposed to win

15:25.180 --> 15:26.680
and get us picked up.

15:26.750 --> 15:28.014
We'll just do the same.

15:28.080 --> 15:29.040
And those Hunters?

15:29.150 --> 15:32.454
We'll stick to the shore
so we can see them coming.

15:32.520 --> 15:34.084
Maybe they can't swim.

15:34.150 --> 15:36.454
Scorpius team is still out there...

15:36.520 --> 15:39.404
They'll finish what those Hunters started.

15:39.470 --> 15:41.714
I'm safer hiding on my own.

15:41.780 --> 15:45.980
Do me a favor and stay away from me.

15:50.300 --> 15:53.654
Just because we're in this together
doesn't mean we're a team.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.794
I'm only following you
because you have the scope.

15:55.860 --> 15:58.120
I don't think so...

15:58.770 --> 16:00.504
Tyl, the lens is cracked.

16:00.570 --> 16:02.500
What?!

16:02.950 --> 16:05.834
See? Crack runs the whole length.

16:05.900 --> 16:08.484
Great! You couldn't spot shit with that!

16:08.550 --> 16:10.104
Now what, Team Captain!?

16:11.480 --> 16:13.064
Rescue party!

16:18.980 --> 16:21.344
Do you see anything!?

16:24.380 --> 16:26.704
Guys?

16:26.770 --> 16:28.900
We're not alone out here...

16:31.840 --> 16:34.420
What do you mean?

16:35.040 --> 16:37.750
See for yourself.

16:39.840 --> 16:42.254
Doesn't look like a rescue party.

16:42.320 --> 16:43.654
Should we talk to him?

16:43.720 --> 16:44.774
I don't know.

16:44.840 --> 16:48.034
I've heard stories about
strange people off-world.

16:48.100 --> 16:50.610
What's he doing here?

16:53.980 --> 16:58.900
Whatever you do, you better hurry.

17:06.070 --> 17:07.464
Where are you from!?

17:07.530 --> 17:08.724
Scorpius? Virgo? Corona?

17:08.791 --> 17:09.943
I'm not from any of those!

17:10.010 --> 17:12.064
Did you kill somebody who was
and take his gear?

17:12.130 --> 17:13.334
It's nothing like that!

17:13.400 --> 17:15.200
I'll be the judge of that!

17:17.600 --> 17:19.545
You don't know what you're doing!
Let go of me!

17:19.612 --> 17:20.951
You don't know what you're doing!

17:21.030 --> 17:23.017
You can't trust the other Academies!

17:23.084 --> 17:25.710
I know! But he's not from an Academy.

17:30.200 --> 17:31.530
How'd you get here?

17:31.610 --> 17:34.654
I was late for the start so
they just sent me through.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.944
Did they say anything about
trouble with the Gates?!

17:37.010 --> 17:39.620
No it was business as usual. Why?

17:39.750 --> 17:42.174
Do you have a communicator?

17:42.240 --> 17:45.270
My teammates have all that.

17:45.870 --> 17:48.270
Where's my team?

17:48.950 --> 17:52.210
They didn't make it.

17:52.950 --> 17:55.884
You can be sad later.
We need to find a way home.

17:55.950 --> 17:58.574
Do you have any equipment we can use?

17:58.640 --> 18:01.714
It was all broken when I got here
so I dropped it.

18:01.780 --> 18:03.804
Where did you leave it?

18:03.870 --> 18:06.144
There was nothing worthwhile left.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.600
I'm positive.

18:07.730 --> 18:10.150
We'll be the judge of that.

18:16.520 --> 18:19.320
There it is.

18:22.670 --> 18:24.744
That's close enough!

18:29.100 --> 18:30.604
Where's the rest of your team?

18:30.670 --> 18:32.254
I hid.

18:32.320 --> 18:34.404
The rest didn't.

18:34.470 --> 18:37.204
But it looks like my fortunes have turned.

18:37.270 --> 18:38.854
Step back.

18:38.920 --> 18:40.484
How'd you get a gun through the Gate?

18:40.550 --> 18:42.484
Made it with his stuff.

18:42.550 --> 18:45.344
That's all the valuables the half-wit left.

18:45.410 --> 18:47.774
Gate must have ruined the rest.

18:47.840 --> 18:50.434
But you seem like a guy
with a lot more to give.

18:50.500 --> 18:51.684
What do you want?

18:51.750 --> 18:53.684
Your telescope for starters.

18:53.750 --> 18:55.544
Mine needs some parts

18:55.610 --> 18:57.434
and you're gonna give them to me.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.434
Is this all in your party?

18:59.500 --> 19:01.884
You got a camp nearby?

19:01.950 --> 19:04.314
You're gonna give me all your belongings

19:04.380 --> 19:07.454
and I'll consider letting
you live to be rescued.

19:07.520 --> 19:10.254
We're dead without our stuff
and you know it.

19:10.320 --> 19:11.514
Not my problem.

19:11.580 --> 19:13.974
No. You can't have it.

19:14.040 --> 19:16.684
Show me your camp or I can just

19:16.750 --> 19:19.810
kill you and find it myself!

19:22.550 --> 19:23.409
He's a kid!

19:23.476 --> 19:24.914
He'll just die on his own anyway.

19:24.980 --> 19:27.574
You need parts and so do we.

19:27.640 --> 19:30.454
Does your telescope have a lens?

19:30.520 --> 19:33.654
Put it in ours and we can work together.

19:33.720 --> 19:36.684
We can all go home tonight.

19:41.210 --> 19:44.350
Tell your friend to come over.

20:00.740 --> 20:04.140
You didn't bring a tent
but you brought that?

20:04.970 --> 20:07.620
It helps me when I'm nervous.

20:07.930 --> 20:10.334
Tyl, you're Team Captain.

20:10.400 --> 20:12.400
You get first try.

20:32.750 --> 20:35.840
Let me show you how it's done!

20:42.640 --> 20:44.580
There it is.

20:47.710 --> 20:49.434
What?!

20:49.500 --> 20:51.144
This thing is broken!

20:51.210 --> 20:52.504
You rigged it!

20:52.570 --> 20:55.200
Would we really rig it to cheat ourselves?

21:09.150 --> 21:12.544
We can't do this without
the rest of our teams.

21:12.610 --> 21:14.544
We need their equipment.

21:14.610 --> 21:18.240
What else can we do? We have to try.

21:21.610 --> 21:24.974
I have no idea where Sol is. Do you?

21:32.210 --> 21:34.144
Why can't you just find it?

21:34.210 --> 21:35.574
We have no tools!

21:35.640 --> 21:37.144
No idea where we are

21:37.210 --> 21:40.130
and no idea where our sun is hiding!

21:40.240 --> 21:41.814
You're so smart?

21:41.880 --> 21:43.770
Find it yourself.

21:57.050 --> 21:58.984
Can I sleep in here?

22:05.170 --> 22:07.440
Come on, Kit.

22:07.510 --> 22:09.584
We need to rest.

22:26.420 --> 22:30.820
Come on Kit, we'll look again tomorrow.

22:51.060 --> 22:54.060
Do you think rescue ships
will scout this area soon?

22:54.180 --> 22:56.574
I don't think they know anything's wrong.

22:56.640 --> 22:58.574
Even if they did

22:58.640 --> 23:01.600
it could take months for them to find us.

23:02.080 --> 23:04.440
Maybe years...

23:04.860 --> 23:08.174
We'll just have to survive
long enough to win.

23:08.240 --> 23:11.880
They put us in teams
for the best chance of survival.

23:12.040 --> 23:13.974
We're gonna keep doing it that way.

23:14.040 --> 23:15.347
Hal, you're a cook right?

23:15.414 --> 23:17.084
It's you're job to make sure we can eat.

23:17.150 --> 23:19.284
But there's nothing out there!
I can't work like this!

23:19.350 --> 23:20.634
None of us should have to.

23:20.700 --> 23:23.344
We all have to pickup duties
we didn't want.

23:23.410 --> 23:26.344
Adrian, you're offense?
Find anything you can out here.

23:26.410 --> 23:27.774
Especially water...

23:27.840 --> 23:29.774
I'm Security against other teams.

23:29.840 --> 23:31.774
That makes me second in command.

23:31.840 --> 23:33.204
You can't reassign me.

23:33.270 --> 23:35.804
All the other teams are dead.

23:35.870 --> 23:37.804
You're a Scout now.

23:37.870 --> 23:39.804
Lex, you're a Technician.

23:39.870 --> 23:41.804
Kit, you're a Chronicle?

23:41.870 --> 23:42.884
Keep recording.

23:42.950 --> 23:45.974
If we do get back you're the only one

23:46.040 --> 23:48.034
that can prove we didn't cheat.

23:48.100 --> 23:50.100
We're all a team now.

24:15.150 --> 24:17.204
Gone...

24:17.270 --> 24:19.204
It's all gone.

24:19.270 --> 24:21.454
There has to be good water somewhere.

24:21.520 --> 24:23.144
We just have to find it.

24:23.210 --> 24:25.210
What are we supposed to do till then?

24:25.320 --> 24:27.270
Stop sweating?

24:27.520 --> 24:30.610
I can't keep going on like this.

24:33.120 --> 24:34.544
He's got water!

24:34.610 --> 24:35.544
What?

24:35.610 --> 24:37.254
There! In his jacket!

24:37.320 --> 24:39.254
I don't have any water!

24:39.320 --> 24:40.974
If I did I wouldn't share it with you...

24:41.040 --> 24:42.204
His lips are wet.

24:42.270 --> 24:43.774
You think I've got water?

24:43.840 --> 24:45.114
Try and take it.

24:45.180 --> 24:47.180
See what happens.

24:56.610 --> 24:59.654
Howard, wait!

25:05.610 --> 25:10.350
Don't drink that!
You're gonna make it worse!

25:11.640 --> 25:14.840
It's fresh...

25:16.920 --> 25:18.604
Fresh! It's fresh!

25:18.670 --> 25:20.604
Fresh water!

25:20.670 --> 25:22.604
Can you imagine what
this is worth back home?

25:22.670 --> 25:24.434
They could stop drilling the moon.

25:24.500 --> 25:25.884
And Europa...

25:25.950 --> 25:28.278
This could change everything!

25:30.134 --> 25:32.044
How could they have missed this?

25:32.111 --> 25:35.016
The Gate must have been built
before the oceans dried.

25:35.083 --> 25:36.861
They weren't looking.

26:00.720 --> 26:02.654
Lex!

26:04.240 --> 26:05.514
Hold him down!

26:05.580 --> 26:07.514
Kit! Water now!

26:07.580 --> 26:09.884
Kit, come on!

26:15.320 --> 26:17.404
What happened?

26:17.470 --> 26:20.804
I don't know. I don't know...

26:20.870 --> 26:23.634
I was just trying to find Sol

26:23.700 --> 26:26.544
and the damn thing shocked me!

26:26.610 --> 26:28.544
Nice job putting it together.

26:28.610 --> 26:30.544
You trying to kill me?!

26:30.610 --> 26:33.040
What's this for?

26:33.950 --> 26:36.670
Part of the scope is open.

26:37.610 --> 26:40.344
You were trying to cheat!

26:40.410 --> 26:43.054
You tried tricking it
to think you found Sol!

26:43.120 --> 26:44.714
But scopes are tamper proof!

26:44.780 --> 26:47.114
Yeah it shocked him in defense!

26:47.180 --> 26:49.114
Does it still work!?

26:52.180 --> 26:53.434
Yeah.

26:53.500 --> 26:55.434
We should throw him out.

26:55.500 --> 26:57.944
Before he pulls something like this again.

26:58.010 --> 26:59.234
Lex?

26:59.300 --> 27:03.084
Do it! I dare you!

27:03.150 --> 27:09.120
You need me as much as I need your stuff.

27:11.300 --> 27:14.640
That's what I thought.

27:16.870 --> 27:19.034
Thanks for the water!

27:19.100 --> 27:21.574
You're not letting him get
away with that are you?

27:21.640 --> 27:23.574
You have to kick him out!

27:23.640 --> 27:24.854
I'm not doing that!

27:24.920 --> 27:26.920
What if he cheats again, or does worse?

27:26.986 --> 27:27.974
What will you do?

27:28.040 --> 27:30.284
Maybe we'll need his help! I don't know-

27:30.350 --> 27:31.975
What do you know?!

27:32.042 --> 27:34.170
Have you ever led anyone?

27:34.237 --> 27:36.749
How long have you even been a Team Captain?

27:37.550 --> 27:39.484
No.

27:39.550 --> 27:41.550
You can't handle this.

28:03.720 --> 28:05.914
Look for a clearing.

28:05.980 --> 28:08.524
Any opening big enough to gather logs.

28:08.591 --> 28:10.654
But we have a light,
we don't need to build a fire.

28:10.720 --> 28:11.914
Not for that!

28:11.980 --> 28:13.174
Then what?

28:13.240 --> 28:15.774
We're not making a fire, kid.

28:15.840 --> 28:17.004
It's for a boat.

28:17.070 --> 28:18.344
Why?

28:18.410 --> 28:20.344
We're leaving.

28:20.410 --> 28:24.780
Do you really want to stay
with those Hunters?

28:25.720 --> 28:27.314
What if this is the only land?

28:27.380 --> 28:29.004
You'd rather wait here to be eaten?

28:29.070 --> 28:30.314
Look...

28:30.380 --> 28:33.484
This can't be the only land.

28:33.550 --> 28:36.204
Someone's gotta be out there.

28:36.270 --> 28:37.654
And we can find 'em.

28:37.720 --> 28:40.720
And contact home.

28:41.520 --> 28:43.114
Now go.

28:43.180 --> 28:46.780
Find logs. Get good ones.

29:11.070 --> 29:13.700
I can't hold on!

29:15.210 --> 29:16.204
Lex!

29:16.270 --> 29:17.714
I'm slipping!

29:17.780 --> 29:19.714
Somebody help me!

29:19.780 --> 29:21.284
Anybody!

29:21.350 --> 29:22.514
Help!

29:24.100 --> 29:26.034
Hang on!

29:26.100 --> 29:28.034
It's gonna pull us in too!

29:28.100 --> 29:29.484
Help!

30:01.440 --> 30:03.284
Tyl, help us!

30:03.350 --> 30:06.314
We need your help! Hurry!

30:14.900 --> 30:17.070
I think he's poisoned.

30:18.120 --> 30:20.144
It's killing him.

30:22.810 --> 30:24.670
What do we do?!

30:26.870 --> 30:28.950
Right here!

30:29.500 --> 30:31.700
The med-pack!

30:34.180 --> 30:36.180
Here!

30:37.300 --> 30:40.804
The venom's bad.
I don't know if he'll make it!

30:40.870 --> 30:44.084
Here, you clean the wound!

30:52.070 --> 30:54.084
Where's the sting kit!?

30:54.150 --> 30:56.150
I'm looking!

30:56.580 --> 30:58.884
Oh no. It's broken!

30:58.950 --> 31:00.884
Are there more?

31:00.950 --> 31:02.884
Hurry!

31:02.950 --> 31:05.374
This is our last one.

31:05.440 --> 31:08.714
Wait! We gotta save it.

31:08.780 --> 31:09.714
What?!

31:09.780 --> 31:11.204
What if one of us gets stung?

31:11.270 --> 31:12.744
He's right.

31:12.810 --> 31:15.374
Use it now and you won't
have one for yourself later.

31:15.440 --> 31:18.240
But he's hurt now!

31:18.810 --> 31:21.314
Use it, Tyl!

31:31.580 --> 31:35.174
Think there could be
more of those things, Lex?

31:35.240 --> 31:39.500
If we're stuck here
it's not long till we find out.

31:46.840 --> 31:49.980
We're not going to
make it out of here are we?

32:04.720 --> 32:07.084
How long will this last?

32:13.180 --> 32:15.114
They're coming!

32:21.180 --> 32:23.114
I'm not staying here. Not again!

32:23.180 --> 32:24.574
Me neither!

32:24.640 --> 32:26.574
He'll bring the Hunters right to us!

32:27.602 --> 32:28.574
Leave him!

32:28.640 --> 32:30.574
Someone has to stay and keep him quiet

32:30.640 --> 32:32.574
or they'll find him for sure!

32:35.274 --> 32:37.434
Eli's the only one that
doesn't do his job anymore.

32:37.500 --> 32:39.004
He's least essential.

32:39.070 --> 32:40.004
Hey! I-

32:40.070 --> 32:43.604
I record, Hal cooks, Lex fixes things

32:43.670 --> 32:45.114
and Tyl saves people.

32:45.180 --> 32:48.114
Have you found Sol yet?

32:48.180 --> 32:50.914
No but I try every night!

32:50.980 --> 32:52.374
He's right, Eli.

32:52.440 --> 32:54.374
You're the least important.

32:54.440 --> 32:56.804
Stay here with Adrian.

32:56.870 --> 32:59.174
Okay...

32:59.240 --> 33:01.174
Lex, is that gun still in your pack?

33:01.240 --> 33:03.174
No, stay out of my pack!

33:03.240 --> 33:05.174
Leave it! No time!

33:32.320 --> 33:34.774
There! At our camp.

33:39.700 --> 33:41.634
What are you doing?

33:52.070 --> 33:57.034
If they go after Eli then
they won't come after us.

34:16.040 --> 34:17.604
You tried to kill me!

34:17.670 --> 34:20.714
Don't pity yourself too much.
You look fine...

34:20.780 --> 34:23.004
Whatever you did to chase them off worked.

34:23.070 --> 34:24.854
I didn't do anything!

34:24.920 --> 34:28.380
Something kept them away...

34:34.320 --> 34:36.084
The light!

34:36.150 --> 34:37.004
What?

34:37.070 --> 34:40.010
Maybe they're afraid of it.

34:41.580 --> 34:44.484
We have only seen them at night.

34:44.550 --> 34:47.084
Maybe the light hurts them.

34:47.150 --> 34:48.804
Burns them.

34:48.870 --> 34:50.804
Do you think it's just the lantern?

34:50.870 --> 34:52.344
I don't know.

34:52.410 --> 34:56.580
But it's not gonna last forever...

35:11.610 --> 35:14.314
As long as there are people on this island

35:14.380 --> 35:18.410
there will be a fire...

35:59.100 --> 36:01.254
Are we sure this will work?

36:01.320 --> 36:03.484
Will fire really keep them away?

36:03.550 --> 36:04.884
I don't know.

36:04.950 --> 36:06.884
When will we know!?

36:06.950 --> 36:10.980
When the Hunters come and eat us or not!

36:11.780 --> 36:14.484
We should get some rest.

36:14.550 --> 36:16.884
I can't sleep like this.

36:16.950 --> 36:19.670
Me neither.

36:45.120 --> 36:48.114
Where's Lex?

36:48.180 --> 36:50.284
Who cares.

36:50.350 --> 36:52.700
We're almost out of wood.

36:55.100 --> 36:57.544
Who's coming with?

36:57.610 --> 37:00.500
I can't go back out there.

38:46.780 --> 38:49.840
Guess you were right about the light.

39:13.840 --> 39:16.054
What? What happened?!

39:16.120 --> 39:19.100
We found something!

39:24.240 --> 39:27.234
I've never seen one before but...

39:27.300 --> 39:28.834
I think it's a Stormrunner!

39:28.900 --> 39:30.404
Can't be! That would mean it's

39:30.470 --> 39:33.604
over two hundred years old...

39:40.900 --> 39:43.750
Where's the rest of it?

39:49.380 --> 39:51.084
It's still intact!

39:51.150 --> 39:52.114
What is?

39:52.180 --> 39:55.374
The computer core, it's still functional!

39:55.440 --> 39:59.514
But the control element's gone.

39:59.580 --> 40:01.314
Without that it's useless.

40:01.380 --> 40:03.314
Just needs a jump-start huh?

40:03.380 --> 40:05.314
This is a waste of our time, Tyl.

40:05.380 --> 40:08.034
I didn't bring you here for nostalgia.

40:08.100 --> 40:10.744
I need help carrying something.

40:10.810 --> 40:12.744
What are we supposed to do with this junk?!

40:12.810 --> 40:14.744
Look how old it is!

40:14.810 --> 40:17.144
That's not junk you're looking at.

40:17.210 --> 40:19.854
There's a Trans-Conduit relay in there.

40:19.920 --> 40:21.254
You sure?

40:21.320 --> 40:24.884
Checked it myself. Still works.

40:24.950 --> 40:26.944
I know what you're thinking.

40:27.010 --> 40:29.854
But if we screw this up
it could ruin the telescope.

40:29.920 --> 40:33.100
Isn't it worth the risk?

40:46.410 --> 40:50.780
This was a Hyperion ship...

40:51.470 --> 40:54.004
If the Hyperions couldn't survive here

40:54.070 --> 40:58.004
how are we supposed to?

41:07.210 --> 41:09.854
A Trans-Conduit relay lets any computer

41:09.920 --> 41:12.914
connect to the network
that links every system.

41:12.980 --> 41:14.914
If we hook it to the scope

41:14.980 --> 41:18.434
we might be able to
send a message back to Earth.

41:18.500 --> 41:19.544
Let me do it.

41:19.610 --> 41:20.914
It's not that simple.

41:20.980 --> 41:22.234
Overload the conductor and

41:22.300 --> 41:24.234
the whole thing's cooked!

41:24.300 --> 41:25.714
That's why I'm doing it...

41:25.780 --> 41:27.544
How long will it take to contact home?

41:27.610 --> 41:30.714
It's not as easy as calling mom and dad...

41:30.780 --> 41:32.374
Connecting with Terra-Net only lets us

41:32.440 --> 41:35.654
transmit messages to individual addresses.

41:35.720 --> 41:38.604
If a message actually makes it...

41:38.670 --> 41:40.604
They'll have to record their own reply

41:40.670 --> 41:43.834
and hope it finds its way
back to the scope.

41:43.900 --> 41:45.404
Which it won't.

41:45.470 --> 41:46.744
If someone responds

41:46.810 --> 41:49.180
we can triangulate our position

41:49.247 --> 41:51.578
and have them send help.

41:52.980 --> 41:55.174
Here we go...

41:57.070 --> 41:57.870
Did you break it?

41:57.950 --> 41:59.068
Can we fix it?

41:59.135 --> 42:00.720
It's fine, I just need my splicer.

42:00.810 --> 42:01.744
Where is it?

42:01.810 --> 42:02.854
My pack, I'll get it.

42:02.920 --> 42:05.720
No you keep working on it. Howard?

42:38.980 --> 42:40.374
What are you doing with that?!

42:40.440 --> 42:42.714
Shut your goddamn mouth!

42:42.780 --> 42:43.684
What's the matter?

42:43.750 --> 42:45.544
Day 1: Assessed Slip Gate.

42:45.610 --> 42:47.514
Unable to establish return portal

42:47.580 --> 42:49.944
for more than three seconds.

42:50.010 --> 42:51.944
Replaced coupler. No improvement.

42:52.010 --> 42:54.574
Day 8: Gemini telescope battery

42:54.640 --> 42:57.004
unable to jump-start Gate.

42:57.070 --> 42:59.884
Day 20: Energy source to power Gate

42:59.950 --> 43:01.654
needs to be larger.

43:01.720 --> 43:03.144
Day 30: Found crashed ship.

43:03.210 --> 43:05.034
Should be able to salvage parts

43:05.100 --> 43:06.314
to stabilize Gate.

43:06.380 --> 43:07.774
He has been sneaking off

43:07.840 --> 43:11.270
and working on the Slip Gate all this time!

43:12.100 --> 43:14.210
Can you fix it?

43:14.640 --> 43:16.254
No.

43:16.320 --> 43:18.254
We don't have the parts.

43:18.320 --> 43:19.284
Why didn't you tell us?

43:19.350 --> 43:22.374
Because he didn't
want to bring us with him!

43:22.440 --> 43:24.774
He was going to leave us here

43:24.840 --> 43:27.054
so that he can go home
and win the games on his own.

43:27.120 --> 43:29.054
I would have sent help when I got back!

43:29.120 --> 43:31.434
You've been lying to us this whole time!

43:31.500 --> 43:33.434
How do you know so much
about Slip Gates, Lex?

43:33.500 --> 43:35.204
Nobody's allowed to learn how they work-

43:35.270 --> 43:37.204
You did this, didn't you?

43:37.270 --> 43:39.204
Didn't you!?

43:39.270 --> 43:41.914
You sabotaged the Slip Gate network...

43:41.980 --> 43:43.484
You rigged it so we'd be stuck

43:43.550 --> 43:45.804
on this backwater planet
with no chance of winning.

43:45.870 --> 43:48.254
But you did too good of a job.

43:48.320 --> 43:50.004
Your team crashed the network so bad

43:50.070 --> 43:51.774
that it sucked everyone in.

43:51.840 --> 43:53.774
You fell into your own trap.

43:53.840 --> 43:54.944
Is he right?

43:55.010 --> 43:56.144
Tell us!

43:56.210 --> 43:57.204
Why'd you do it!?

43:57.270 --> 44:00.210
Because I have to win!

44:02.550 --> 44:06.100
If I don't bring back that Hyperion coin...

44:07.470 --> 44:09.634
You wouldn't understand.

44:09.700 --> 44:11.854
I had to do it!

44:11.920 --> 44:13.944
Everything that's happened...

44:14.010 --> 44:15.944
Everything!

44:16.010 --> 44:17.174
It's all your fault.

44:17.240 --> 44:18.854
That night with the Hunters

44:18.920 --> 44:21.284
you tried killing me to hide the journal.

44:21.350 --> 44:22.914
Instead I saved you!

44:22.980 --> 44:26.484
Where would we be if we didn't
learn what light can do?!

44:26.550 --> 44:27.944
And the rest?

44:28.010 --> 44:31.004
This is Sol Invictus.

44:31.070 --> 44:33.404
Winning's the only rule.

44:33.470 --> 44:35.834
They should have known
what they were getting in to.

44:35.900 --> 44:37.634
Wrap it however you want.

44:37.700 --> 44:40.514
If you hadn't done that, we'd be home now!

44:40.580 --> 44:44.640
And innocent people would still be alive.

44:45.380 --> 44:48.900
I feel sorry for you.

44:59.780 --> 45:01.254
What are we gonna do with him?

45:01.320 --> 45:02.974
Can't trust him anymore.

45:03.040 --> 45:05.204
Before you do anything rash,

45:05.270 --> 45:07.150
afraid I need him over here.

45:08.240 --> 45:10.944
The relay's almost done.

45:11.010 --> 45:12.780
Go.

45:32.300 --> 45:33.884
The signal's too weak.

45:33.950 --> 45:35.343
That's as good as we're gonna get.

45:35.410 --> 45:37.404
That won't get the messages
half way to Earth!

45:37.470 --> 45:40.320
Then we'll try anyway!

45:44.700 --> 45:48.574
This is Lex of Scorpius
to anyone at command.

45:48.640 --> 45:51.150
Hi, Mom and Dad...

45:51.550 --> 45:54.514
By now you've probably heard from school.

45:54.580 --> 45:57.404
We've no idea where we are.

45:57.470 --> 45:59.404
Nobody does.

45:59.470 --> 46:01.404
My assignment

46:01.470 --> 46:04.884
did more than we could have imagined.

46:04.950 --> 46:07.634
Trapping me on the same

46:07.700 --> 46:10.574
unknown planet as the rest of them.

46:10.640 --> 46:13.350
Why did I come out here?

46:13.980 --> 46:16.514
Was I wrong about all this?

46:16.580 --> 46:18.974
Everything I did,

46:19.040 --> 46:21.670
I did for the mission.

47:34.750 --> 47:37.454
Please respond.

47:37.520 --> 47:40.084
Please...

47:40.150 --> 47:42.684
Say anything.

47:42.750 --> 47:45.410
I'll win.

47:45.950 --> 47:48.004
One way or the other.

47:48.070 --> 47:50.234
I can't wait to get home.

47:50.300 --> 47:52.774
I love you guys.

47:52.840 --> 47:54.840
See you soon.

47:55.640 --> 47:58.484
Say anything...

47:58.550 --> 48:01.500
I just want to hear from you.

48:17.040 --> 48:19.040
Let's send these things!

48:20.010 --> 48:22.210
Enter the address here.

48:31.240 --> 48:33.344
This is it!

48:42.980 --> 48:44.084
That's it?

48:44.150 --> 48:46.834
What were you expecting,
an instant response?

48:46.900 --> 48:48.834
It could take hours
for them to reach everyone.

48:48.900 --> 48:50.004
Then leave it on all night.

48:50.070 --> 48:53.100
I want to know the instant we get a reply!

49:04.180 --> 49:07.950
I wonder what it looks like from up there.

49:09.040 --> 49:12.470
From all those other fires.

49:28.580 --> 49:31.580
Want to check yours?

49:34.810 --> 49:36.514
That's enough.

49:36.580 --> 49:38.034
Time to turn it off.

49:38.100 --> 49:39.174
Wait!

49:39.240 --> 49:41.091
I want to know when they hear from me.

49:41.158 --> 49:43.305
If we leave it on any longer
we'll kill the battery.

49:43.372 --> 49:45.240
No!

49:45.520 --> 49:47.744
Wait! I want to hear back!

49:47.810 --> 49:49.454
Turn it off or we're really screwed!

49:49.520 --> 49:50.684
Give it to me!

49:50.750 --> 49:52.750
Let it go!

50:03.010 --> 50:04.454
Give it to me.

50:04.520 --> 50:07.010
So you're gonna shoot me now!?

50:08.100 --> 50:09.714
Give me the gun, Kit!

50:09.780 --> 50:10.854
No!

50:10.920 --> 50:12.454
Kit, give me the gun!

50:12.520 --> 50:14.034
Kit!

50:14.100 --> 50:15.914
Give me the gun!

50:15.980 --> 50:17.914
No!

50:34.380 --> 50:35.634
What'd you do!?

50:35.700 --> 50:37.004
It was an accident!

50:37.070 --> 50:38.914
I- I didn't...

50:38.980 --> 50:40.980
What have you done?!

50:41.750 --> 50:44.634
Eli, please just hold still.

50:44.700 --> 50:46.634
Just give me a second!

50:46.700 --> 50:48.744
Eli!

52:09.240 --> 52:10.604
Of course it was his fault!

52:10.670 --> 52:12.604
Okay! You're right. But...

52:12.670 --> 52:14.084
He didn't mean to-

52:14.150 --> 52:17.150
He feels even worse about it than you do.

52:17.550 --> 52:21.040
You can't make him sleep outside forever.

52:32.550 --> 52:34.884
You got us into this mess,

52:34.950 --> 52:37.380
it's your job to get us out.

52:38.380 --> 52:40.574
You're in charge now.

52:45.900 --> 52:48.944
Time to stop waiting.

53:04.440 --> 53:06.374
No way...

53:11.980 --> 53:13.574
Message received?

53:13.640 --> 53:15.114
Message received?!

53:15.180 --> 53:17.114
Message received!

53:17.180 --> 53:18.854
We got one! We got a reply!

53:18.920 --> 53:20.034
Somebody sent a response!

53:20.100 --> 53:22.434
Somebody heard from us!?

53:25.580 --> 53:27.884
Tyl, somebody sent a reply!

53:30.300 --> 53:31.834
Eli VO: Hi, Mom and Dad.

53:31.900 --> 53:33.254
We haven't received a response.

53:33.320 --> 53:35.520
It's one of our own messages
bounced back to us.

53:35.810 --> 53:37.774
It didn't even make it out of the system.

53:39.840 --> 53:41.514
No one received any messages.

53:41.580 --> 53:43.580
No one ever will!

53:43.980 --> 53:46.314
I can't believe we thought
this thing would work.

53:48.380 --> 53:50.004
Wait a second!

53:50.070 --> 53:52.004
Just one of the messages bounced back.

53:52.070 --> 53:53.974
Others could still make it through!

53:54.040 --> 53:57.144
But if you break the telescope
we'll never know!

53:57.210 --> 53:59.144
To think I let you

53:59.210 --> 54:01.684
get my hopes up, Hal.

54:01.750 --> 54:03.684
You couldn't even check the message.

54:03.750 --> 54:07.580
You just started dancing
around like a fat fool!

54:08.040 --> 54:10.054
You broke my gun.

54:10.120 --> 54:13.054
We lost our food because of you!

54:13.120 --> 54:15.454
How could anybody be so stupid

54:15.520 --> 54:17.454
and yet still be alive?!

54:17.520 --> 54:19.084
You've gotta be the most hapless oaf

54:19.150 --> 54:21.034
I've ever seen in my life!

54:25.240 --> 54:27.744
Stop it! Hal, stop!

54:34.900 --> 54:37.714
I shouldn't be here.

54:37.780 --> 54:40.144
I want to go home.

54:41.900 --> 54:43.834
I want to go home!

54:45.500 --> 54:49.574
None of this was supposed to happen...

54:49.640 --> 54:52.750
What was I thinking?

55:12.840 --> 55:14.404
We can't build a boat!

55:14.470 --> 55:16.974
Haven't you seen what's out there?
We'd never make it!

55:17.040 --> 55:17.944
We're trapped!

55:18.010 --> 55:19.114
It's our only option.

55:19.180 --> 55:21.834
Would you rather die here
or trying to find help?!

55:21.900 --> 55:24.054
There's no one out there to help us!

55:24.120 --> 55:26.054
It's up to us to make it back!

55:26.120 --> 55:28.054
You put me in charge, remember?

55:28.120 --> 55:29.884
Or do you think you can do better?

55:29.950 --> 55:32.174
Tyl might listen to you, but I'm not.

55:32.240 --> 55:34.744
I'm not going out there!
I'm not making a boat!

55:34.810 --> 55:36.284
Then you can live on your own.

55:36.350 --> 55:39.974
If you're not working
I'm kicking you out of my camp!

55:40.040 --> 55:41.834
This wouldn't be such a problem

55:41.900 --> 55:43.834
if you hadn't murdered our only Astronomer!

55:45.900 --> 55:48.320
Hey!

55:54.150 --> 55:57.350
You look like shit.

55:58.010 --> 56:00.470
What's going on?

56:03.580 --> 56:05.920
Here that long, huh?

56:06.810 --> 56:09.780
Any more ideas how we got here?

56:12.980 --> 56:14.654
No.

56:14.720 --> 56:16.654
There is

56:16.720 --> 56:19.010
one other option.

56:19.350 --> 56:21.254
Every year the Board of Governors

56:21.320 --> 56:24.410
sends out a judge in each team to observe.

56:24.810 --> 56:26.854
No one ever knows about it.

56:26.920 --> 56:29.544
The judges pick a contestant
from every team,

56:29.610 --> 56:31.610
make sure they can trust him,

56:32.010 --> 56:35.344
and assign him to report back on the games.

56:35.410 --> 56:38.980
Sometimes I bet they even rig it.

56:42.870 --> 56:45.054
How'd you find this out?

56:45.120 --> 56:47.840
I talked it out of someone last year.

56:49.270 --> 56:50.374
Now.

56:50.440 --> 56:53.270
No one can come home till someone's won.

56:53.550 --> 56:55.684
These judges do it all the time.

56:55.750 --> 56:58.834
Pop home to report then slip right back.

56:58.900 --> 57:00.834
Say they'd gone to
the bathroom or something.

57:00.900 --> 57:03.500
I know how to contact the Gate Ops.

57:04.010 --> 57:06.174
Tell 'em you're a student judge,

57:06.240 --> 57:07.854
and they'll bring you home.

57:07.920 --> 57:09.854
If you were right

57:09.920 --> 57:11.854
I would have heard about it.

57:11.920 --> 57:14.054
How can we believe you?

57:14.120 --> 57:16.350
Because Shrimp,

57:17.070 --> 57:19.720
that's how I got home first.

57:20.240 --> 57:22.804
That's how I cheated.

57:22.870 --> 57:24.574
I told the Slip Gate Operators

57:24.640 --> 57:25.714
that I was a judge.

57:25.780 --> 57:28.054
When I came out I raised my scope

57:28.120 --> 57:30.380
and said I'd found Sol.

57:31.120 --> 57:33.484
The Gate Ops don't talk but

57:33.550 --> 57:35.634
the judges figured it out.

57:35.700 --> 57:38.484
There's no way to contact home
or I'd have done it.

57:38.550 --> 57:40.054
There's one.

57:40.120 --> 57:43.854
That Hyperion ship
still has a working core.

57:43.920 --> 57:46.454
Your scope is programmed for the Gate Ops.

57:46.520 --> 57:48.084
If you run it through the ship

57:48.150 --> 57:49.544
it'll let you call for a pick-up.

57:49.610 --> 57:51.180
No.

57:52.120 --> 57:54.084
The control element's missing.

57:54.150 --> 57:56.440
We'd never find it out here.

58:00.180 --> 58:02.374
You knew a way home

58:02.440 --> 58:04.054
and you didn't tell us?

58:04.120 --> 58:05.854
What were you waiting for?!

58:05.920 --> 58:07.974
When they realize we cheated
they'll come after us

58:08.040 --> 58:09.974
with everything they have.

58:10.040 --> 58:12.500
We'd be better off staying here.

58:12.780 --> 58:14.604
You made it back...

58:14.670 --> 58:16.174
It took

58:16.240 --> 58:19.950
everything my family had to get me back in.

58:21.920 --> 58:23.854
I'd never do it again either.

58:23.920 --> 58:26.254
If not for all this.

58:26.320 --> 58:28.580
But look at all that's happened.

58:28.920 --> 58:30.834
Wouldn't they understand?

58:30.900 --> 58:32.404
Believe me,

58:32.470 --> 58:34.810
they won't care.

58:35.210 --> 58:37.284
If you try and explain beforehand

58:37.350 --> 58:38.834
you'll just blow your cover.

58:38.900 --> 58:40.634
Is it really that bad?

58:40.700 --> 58:42.634
When you stand before them

58:42.700 --> 58:45.980
and see your entire future slipping away.

58:47.470 --> 58:49.774
Remember how you felt today.

58:49.840 --> 58:51.774
Cause whoever gives them their name

58:51.840 --> 58:54.780
that's the one they'll come after worst.

58:55.350 --> 58:57.520
He's done.

58:58.320 --> 58:59.914
We'll do it.

58:59.980 --> 59:01.714
No.

59:01.780 --> 59:03.314
No we won't.

59:03.380 --> 59:05.314
I'm in charge now remember?

59:05.380 --> 59:07.804
I just want to go home.

59:07.870 --> 59:09.144
More than anything.

59:09.210 --> 59:10.540
I'm sorry. I am.

59:10.607 --> 59:12.484
I want to go home too
but there's another way

59:12.550 --> 59:14.544
off this planet and I'm gonna find it.

59:14.610 --> 59:18.350
You can't have the scope. I'm sorry.

59:19.180 --> 59:20.234
Wait, Lex-

59:20.300 --> 59:21.920
No!

59:58.750 --> 1:00:00.654
Where's the scope?!

1:00:00.720 --> 1:00:01.804
It's gone!

1:00:01.870 --> 1:00:03.574
Could he have gone to look for Sol?

1:00:03.640 --> 1:00:04.774
We gotta find him!

1:00:04.840 --> 1:00:06.574
He could be anywhere by now. How can we-

1:00:06.640 --> 1:00:08.574
Quiet!

1:00:08.640 --> 1:00:11.004
Listen.

1:00:14.150 --> 1:00:17.120
Your camera's still connected to it.

1:00:19.120 --> 1:00:21.520
I see something.

1:00:22.120 --> 1:00:24.054
Hal? Hal?

1:00:24.120 --> 1:00:26.350
Hal, what's going on!?

1:00:28.210 --> 1:00:29.544
I'm taking the scope.

1:00:29.610 --> 1:00:31.374
I won't let your ruin this. I'm going home!

1:00:31.440 --> 1:00:33.744
But we need the scope.
You can't just take it!

1:00:33.810 --> 1:00:35.744
You know we'll never find Sol!

1:00:35.810 --> 1:00:38.574
But at least if I call home
we can finally leave.

1:00:38.640 --> 1:00:41.774
What about us?
Somebody has to take the fall!

1:00:41.840 --> 1:00:43.454
Don't we get a say in it?!

1:00:43.520 --> 1:00:44.714
I'm sorry,

1:00:44.780 --> 1:00:47.034
but I don't care about the tournament.

1:00:47.100 --> 1:00:48.470
I can live with the consequences,

1:00:48.537 --> 1:00:50.714
my family needs me home.

1:00:50.780 --> 1:00:51.974
You wouldn't understand.

1:00:52.040 --> 1:00:53.284
It's easy for you to talk big

1:00:53.350 --> 1:00:55.314
when you're the one
running with our telescope!

1:00:55.380 --> 1:00:56.654
What would you know?

1:00:56.720 --> 1:00:58.834
I'm doing it to help someone.

1:00:58.900 --> 1:01:00.234
You guys have never thought

1:01:00.300 --> 1:01:02.300
about anybody but yourselves!

1:01:02.780 --> 1:01:04.004
No...

1:01:08.350 --> 1:01:09.574
Hal! Do you have a light?

1:01:09.640 --> 1:01:11.914
You need to get back to camp. Hurry!

1:01:11.980 --> 1:01:13.714
I think I hear something.

1:01:13.780 --> 1:01:15.574
Where are you, Hal?

1:01:15.640 --> 1:01:17.171
I'm in the forest.

1:01:17.238 --> 1:01:18.974
That's their forest.
That's where they live!

1:01:19.040 --> 1:01:21.514
Listen! Hide.
We're coming for you right now.

1:01:23.720 --> 1:01:25.084
Hal, run!

1:01:43.380 --> 1:01:45.344
You had your chance!

1:01:45.410 --> 1:01:47.634
You don't know what you're doing!

1:01:47.700 --> 1:01:50.180
Why should we trust you now?

1:01:51.870 --> 1:01:54.380
Because I know what to do.

1:01:56.470 --> 1:01:58.780
I'm getting us home.

1:01:59.410 --> 1:02:01.374
It's Tyl's team.

1:02:01.440 --> 1:02:03.840
I'm with him.

1:02:19.210 --> 1:02:21.744
If I do this,

1:02:21.810 --> 1:02:25.320
do you promise you'll get us home?

1:02:28.870 --> 1:02:31.700
I promise.

1:02:41.500 --> 1:02:44.174
It's not safe to split up.

1:02:44.240 --> 1:02:46.684
We'll just have to comb the whole forest.

1:02:52.840 --> 1:02:55.634
No point delaying the inevitable.

1:03:23.720 --> 1:03:26.544
It's quiet here.

1:03:26.610 --> 1:03:29.100
I don't like it.

1:03:42.520 --> 1:03:44.950
There it is.

1:03:46.500 --> 1:03:49.084
Let's make a break for it.

1:03:49.150 --> 1:03:50.604
Wait.

1:03:50.670 --> 1:03:53.604
Whatever did this could still be here.

1:04:38.470 --> 1:04:40.144
The telescope!

1:04:40.210 --> 1:04:41.434
Is it okay?!

1:04:41.500 --> 1:04:42.714
It's fine!

1:04:42.780 --> 1:04:44.780
But look...

1:04:53.870 --> 1:04:55.604
I think-

1:04:55.670 --> 1:04:58.670
I think they took Hal down there.

1:05:01.070 --> 1:05:02.514
Can you see anything?

1:05:02.580 --> 1:05:04.284
There are tunnels inside.

1:05:04.350 --> 1:05:06.144
Long ones...

1:05:06.210 --> 1:05:08.670
I can't see the ends.

1:05:09.470 --> 1:05:12.604
It must be where they go during the day.

1:05:12.670 --> 1:05:15.144
There could be a whole world down there.

1:05:15.210 --> 1:05:17.750
Even bigger than the island.

1:05:19.010 --> 1:05:22.604
Then let's keep it down there.

1:05:28.380 --> 1:05:31.010
This is the only way out.

1:05:32.150 --> 1:05:34.300
Are you sure?

1:05:34.700 --> 1:05:37.440
Unless those things can fly.

1:05:41.610 --> 1:05:44.270
Do you think it'll be able to stop 'em?

1:05:45.900 --> 1:05:48.410
I don't know.

1:06:01.210 --> 1:06:03.580
Stop! Listen!

1:06:04.520 --> 1:06:06.804
They're not coming!

1:06:12.980 --> 1:06:15.344
It worked.

1:06:15.410 --> 1:06:17.300
It works!

1:06:17.980 --> 1:06:20.440
Are we sure it'll last all night?

1:06:20.870 --> 1:06:22.774
I hope.

1:06:22.840 --> 1:06:24.774
We'll have to keep the fire going.

1:06:24.840 --> 1:06:26.174
I'll take tomorrow.

1:06:26.240 --> 1:06:28.454
Then Lex. Then you, Kit.

1:06:28.520 --> 1:06:30.750
We'll keep them trapped forever.

1:06:32.270 --> 1:06:34.204
I wonder if they'll start to eat each other

1:06:34.270 --> 1:06:36.514
when they realize they're never leaving.

1:06:54.700 --> 1:06:57.870
Are you sure you're ready?

1:07:00.900 --> 1:07:03.520
Then let's go home.

1:07:27.920 --> 1:07:29.944
The core's still intact.

1:07:30.010 --> 1:07:32.114
All we need is the control element.

1:07:32.180 --> 1:07:33.640
No.

1:07:33.980 --> 1:07:35.834
Not like this.

1:07:35.900 --> 1:07:37.314
I can't go home like that.

1:07:37.380 --> 1:07:39.950
It's time to go home!

1:08:04.550 --> 1:08:06.084
Tyl, that's not gonna work.

1:08:06.150 --> 1:08:07.700
Main power's offline.

1:08:09.040 --> 1:08:11.144
Then what can we do?

1:08:11.210 --> 1:08:12.900
I can do it.

1:08:13.120 --> 1:08:14.054
Let me try.

1:08:14.120 --> 1:08:15.544
One wrong wire

1:08:15.610 --> 1:08:17.544
and he could fry the whole computer.

1:08:17.610 --> 1:08:21.100
If he ever wanted to
screw us over it would be now.

1:08:21.844 --> 1:08:23.727
Can you get it to work?

1:08:23.805 --> 1:08:24.634
No!

1:08:24.700 --> 1:08:27.054
I'm sorry but how can we trust him?

1:08:27.120 --> 1:08:29.120
Because.

1:08:30.010 --> 1:08:32.320
He's better than that.

1:08:33.150 --> 1:08:35.670
Fix it.

1:09:16.520 --> 1:09:19.204
Slip Gate Operator: Come in,
this is Slip Gate Control.

1:09:19.270 --> 1:09:20.174
Hello?

1:09:20.240 --> 1:09:22.174
Gate Op: Who's this? Identify yourself.

1:09:22.240 --> 1:09:24.174
I'm a student judge in the
Sol Invictus games.

1:09:24.240 --> 1:09:26.174
Requesting immediate transit back to Earth

1:09:26.240 --> 1:09:27.314
for a report.

1:09:27.380 --> 1:09:30.144
Gate Op: Sol Invictus? That was weeks ago.

1:09:30.210 --> 1:09:31.834
We thought you were all dead.

1:09:31.900 --> 1:09:33.254
We're not.

1:09:33.320 --> 1:09:34.204
Not yet.

1:09:34.270 --> 1:09:35.404
Gate Op: I don't believe it.

1:09:35.470 --> 1:09:37.084
We need to get you back for debrief.

1:09:37.150 --> 1:09:38.054
What's your name?

1:09:38.120 --> 1:09:38.935
My name?

1:09:39.002 --> 1:09:40.884
Gate Op: Every portal needs
a record on file

1:09:40.950 --> 1:09:44.544
for who authorized it.
Especially student judges.

1:09:44.610 --> 1:09:47.670
Give me your name.

1:09:48.040 --> 1:09:51.034
Kit. Kit of Capricorn.

1:09:51.100 --> 1:09:53.174
I take full responsibility.

1:09:53.240 --> 1:09:55.544
I need a portal back to Earth immediately.

1:09:55.610 --> 1:09:57.054
The Gate here was damaged.

1:09:57.120 --> 1:09:58.518
I can't get a portal up.

1:09:58.585 --> 1:10:00.114
I need you to open one on your end.

1:10:00.180 --> 1:10:01.774
We can still activate one from Earth.

1:10:01.840 --> 1:10:03.684
All I need is your planet code.

1:10:03.750 --> 1:10:05.834
Give it to me and we'll
have you home by nightfall.

1:10:05.900 --> 1:10:07.076
Can't you tell me where I am?

1:10:07.143 --> 1:10:08.514
We don't know where you landed.

1:10:08.580 --> 1:10:10.054
Now we can open a portal

1:10:10.120 --> 1:10:12.604
but only if we know which one to use.

1:10:12.670 --> 1:10:14.854
Without that there's
no way to get you home.

1:10:14.920 --> 1:10:16.454
Then open all the Gates in the system!

1:10:16.520 --> 1:10:18.144
Do you have any idea how many that is?

1:10:18.210 --> 1:10:20.054
The resources that would waste?!

1:10:20.120 --> 1:10:21.484
You know we can't do that.

1:10:21.550 --> 1:10:23.284
What about a rescue party?

1:10:23.350 --> 1:10:24.744
Can you send anyone?

1:10:24.810 --> 1:10:25.744
We can't.

1:10:25.810 --> 1:10:29.084
You could be in any corner of the galaxy.

1:10:29.150 --> 1:10:31.654
What are you saying?

1:10:31.720 --> 1:10:33.654
You know what I'm saying.

1:10:33.720 --> 1:10:35.314
If we don't know what planet you're on,

1:10:35.380 --> 1:10:37.634
there's nothing we can do.

1:10:37.700 --> 1:10:40.174
I know this is hard to hear

1:10:40.240 --> 1:10:42.254
but you're not coming home.

1:10:42.320 --> 1:10:43.684
I'm sorry.

1:10:43.750 --> 1:10:45.684
Gate Control out...

1:10:51.470 --> 1:10:54.180
We got so close...

1:10:54.550 --> 1:10:58.054
Now we're even further
than when we started.

1:10:58.120 --> 1:11:00.720
How could this have happened to us?

1:11:00.980 --> 1:11:02.380
I'm sorry.

1:11:04.040 --> 1:11:06.054
I'm really sorry.

1:11:06.120 --> 1:11:08.470
We're never going home.

1:11:09.840 --> 1:11:12.054
What is home?

1:11:12.120 --> 1:11:14.120
This isn't.

1:11:14.470 --> 1:11:16.520
It could never be.

1:11:23.100 --> 1:11:25.144
The fire's almost out.

1:11:25.210 --> 1:11:27.204
Maybe you should put some wood on it.

1:11:27.270 --> 1:11:29.270
What's the point?

1:11:30.143 --> 1:11:31.004
Where are you going?

1:11:31.070 --> 1:11:33.720
Does it even matter anymore?!

1:12:05.840 --> 1:12:08.544
My name is Tyl of Libra.

1:12:08.610 --> 1:12:10.544
The date?

1:12:10.610 --> 1:12:12.884
I don't even know.

1:12:12.950 --> 1:12:15.054
If you found this telescope then you're

1:12:15.120 --> 1:12:16.714
probably stranded here too.

1:12:16.780 --> 1:12:18.454
If that's the case,

1:12:18.520 --> 1:12:21.640
then I'm sorry.

1:12:22.320 --> 1:12:23.774
My only advice is-

1:12:27.720 --> 1:12:30.174
No...

1:12:32.750 --> 1:12:35.804
Message VO: Eli?
Eli, I just saw your message.

1:12:35.870 --> 1:12:38.544
Where are you? What happened?

1:12:38.610 --> 1:12:40.544
We're so worried.

1:12:40.610 --> 1:12:42.604
Your father and I
have been trying to find you

1:12:42.670 --> 1:12:44.654
and no one will tell us anything.

1:12:44.720 --> 1:12:46.434
They just said there was an accident

1:12:46.500 --> 1:12:48.114
with the Slip Gates.

1:12:48.180 --> 1:12:49.684
We thought you were lost...

1:12:49.750 --> 1:12:52.404
I am so glad you're okay!

1:12:52.470 --> 1:12:54.604
We'll never give up on finding you.

1:12:54.670 --> 1:12:58.054
Even if we have to search
every planet ourselves.

1:12:58.120 --> 1:13:00.174
We will find you.

1:13:00.240 --> 1:13:02.744
I'll see you soon, son.

1:13:02.810 --> 1:13:04.114
I love you.

1:13:06.300 --> 1:13:08.484
What do you want me to do?

1:13:08.550 --> 1:13:10.914
I don't know what to tell her!

1:13:10.980 --> 1:13:13.470
If I send a response...

1:13:14.900 --> 1:13:16.470
Wait...

1:13:16.980 --> 1:13:18.714
Send a response!

1:13:18.780 --> 1:13:20.084
Trace that message!

1:13:20.150 --> 1:13:22.374
Point of origin.

1:13:24.320 --> 1:13:26.254
Ignore!

1:13:29.100 --> 1:13:31.284
You're all the way over there?

1:13:40.840 --> 1:13:42.840
Oh come on!

1:13:50.700 --> 1:13:53.484
Not yet you're not! Come on!

1:14:28.580 --> 1:14:30.810
There you are...

1:14:31.950 --> 1:14:33.684
Wait.

1:14:33.750 --> 1:14:35.684
If you're Sol...

1:14:35.750 --> 1:14:38.720
You can be my reference point!

1:14:39.180 --> 1:14:41.854
Triangulate position.

1:14:41.920 --> 1:14:44.974
Point of reference.

1:14:45.040 --> 1:14:48.484
Using that star.

1:14:48.550 --> 1:14:51.914
As Sol...

1:14:59.520 --> 1:15:02.234
Cygnus B-7.

1:15:02.300 --> 1:15:04.714
Cygnus B-7!

1:15:07.300 --> 1:15:09.974
Gate Op: Gate Control.
Come in this is Gate Control.

1:15:10.040 --> 1:15:11.254
I'm a Sol contestant!

1:15:11.320 --> 1:15:12.604
I need immediate transit-

1:15:12.670 --> 1:15:14.254
Gate Op: Kid, I'm sorry.

1:15:14.320 --> 1:15:15.974
But unless you've got a planet code

1:15:16.040 --> 1:15:17.034
I've got nothing else-

1:15:17.100 --> 1:15:19.034
Cygnus B-7!

1:15:19.100 --> 1:15:20.144
We're on Cygnus B-7!

1:15:20.210 --> 1:15:22.714
Gate Op: Cygnus B-7...

1:15:22.780 --> 1:15:24.714
Cygnus B-7?!

1:15:24.780 --> 1:15:26.100
You're all the way out there!?

1:15:26.412 --> 1:15:29.804
That's an H Class planet.
Unsafe for human habitation!

1:15:29.870 --> 1:15:30.854
How did you-

1:15:30.920 --> 1:15:32.234
Never mind! Listen!

1:15:32.300 --> 1:15:34.374
Get to the Slip Gate as fast as you can.

1:15:34.440 --> 1:15:36.374
I just sent through the activation command.

1:15:36.440 --> 1:15:37.914
A portal will be up soon.

1:15:37.980 --> 1:15:39.454
Wait! You gotta delay it!

1:15:39.520 --> 1:15:40.834
I have to find my friends first!

1:15:40.900 --> 1:15:43.114
That gate's not stable
enough to hold for long!

1:15:43.180 --> 1:15:45.974
A few minutes tops
and it's gonna collapse for good!

1:15:46.040 --> 1:15:48.574
Come home now while you still can!

1:16:07.950 --> 1:16:10.084
Take Adrian and get to the Slip Gate!

1:16:10.150 --> 1:16:11.544
What about you?!

1:16:11.610 --> 1:16:13.610
I gotta find Lex!

1:16:25.550 --> 1:16:27.254
We don't have any time! You go ahead!

1:16:27.320 --> 1:16:29.254
No! We're all going home!

1:16:29.320 --> 1:16:30.684
Give him to me!

1:16:30.750 --> 1:16:32.750
Go!

1:16:39.670 --> 1:16:41.670
Let's go! Hurry!

1:16:45.500 --> 1:16:47.144
Did you hear that?

1:16:47.210 --> 1:16:48.374
Don't worry about it!

1:16:48.440 --> 1:16:49.544
They do that every night

1:16:49.610 --> 1:16:51.520
when they're burned by the fire!

1:16:51.700 --> 1:16:53.834
Should be ready in a few minutes!

1:16:55.210 --> 1:16:57.210
Wait!

1:16:58.980 --> 1:17:01.374
That one didn't come from the forest.

1:17:01.440 --> 1:17:03.374
How did they-

1:17:04.700 --> 1:17:06.084
Kit! You didn't-

1:17:06.150 --> 1:17:07.810
I'm sorry!

1:17:07.980 --> 1:17:10.174
I didn't think we'd make it.

1:17:10.240 --> 1:17:12.174
It's not gonna form in time!

1:17:14.240 --> 1:17:16.484
If we run we might
be able to get away from them!

1:17:16.550 --> 1:17:17.854
The portal's gonna collapse!

1:17:17.920 --> 1:17:19.374
It can't re-open after this!

1:17:19.440 --> 1:17:22.254
We can try and fix it
later but right now we have to-

1:17:23.670 --> 1:17:24.524
Run!

1:17:24.591 --> 1:17:25.774
No!

1:17:25.840 --> 1:17:28.084
We're not running anymore!

1:17:28.150 --> 1:17:29.204
You're going home.

1:17:29.270 --> 1:17:30.114
What?!

1:17:30.181 --> 1:17:31.374
No we can't leave you!

1:17:31.440 --> 1:17:33.034
I'll buy you some time.

1:17:33.100 --> 1:17:34.514
Take Adrian with you.

1:17:34.580 --> 1:17:36.840
Take Adrian!

1:17:38.150 --> 1:17:40.144
Take it!

1:17:42.900 --> 1:17:44.204
Go home.

1:17:44.270 --> 1:17:45.654
What are you doing, Tyl?!

1:17:45.720 --> 1:17:48.470
Have you even thought about this?!

1:17:55.350 --> 1:17:57.714
Go home, guys.

1:19:29.720 --> 1:19:32.204
VO: Here we stand,

1:19:32.270 --> 1:19:35.180
on the shoulders of giants.

1:19:35.580 --> 1:19:37.544
These are our words.

1:19:37.610 --> 1:19:40.070
And our sacred charge.

1:19:40.980 --> 1:19:43.980
Greatness is the foundation of our world.

1:19:44.270 --> 1:19:47.344
Greatness let us survive
centuries of strife.

1:19:47.410 --> 1:19:49.684
Tame the physical world to our will.

1:19:49.750 --> 1:19:51.834
And spread across the stars

1:19:51.900 --> 1:19:54.914
at the speed of light.

1:19:54.980 --> 1:19:58.514
That same greatness may be in you.

1:19:58.580 --> 1:20:01.380
Now, it's time to find out...

1:20:26.530 --> 1:20:31.040
Welcome to Sol Invictus...
