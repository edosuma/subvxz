24:36.541 --> 24:38.175
                      HI.

24:38.177 --> 24:40.578
I BROUGHT YOU A PICTURE
OF GRANDPA SHERMAN.

24:40.580 --> 24:43.581
THIS WAS TAKEN BY THE LAKE
THAT HE USED TO TAKE ME TO.

24:45.517 --> 24:47.852
          HUH. YEAH, HE USED TO
          TAKE ME THERE, TOO.

24:47.854 --> 24:52.523
WHY DO YOU THINK GOD
HAD GRANDMA AND GRANDPA
DIE IN A CAR CRASH?

24:52.525 --> 24:54.625
          WHO TOLD YOU
          THAT GOD HAD THEM DIE?

24:54.627 --> 24:57.661
MOM. SHE SAID THAT GOD
WILL NEVER TAKE ANYONE,

24:57.663 --> 24:59.997
UNLESS IT WAS THEIR TIME.

24:59.999 --> 25:01.198
                      YEAH.

25:04.536 --> 25:06.937
        GOOD MORNING, BEAUTIFUL.

25:06.939 --> 25:08.539
HELLO, WILLIAM.

25:08.541 --> 25:10.274
         THESE ARE FOR YOU.

25:10.276 --> 25:12.276
 THANK YOU FOR
 THE BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS,

25:12.278 --> 25:14.512
 BUT YOU CAN'T KEEP
 COMING BY LIKE THIS.

25:14.514 --> 25:16.514
            OH, COME ON.
            DON'T YOU LIKE 'EM?

25:16.516 --> 25:18.282
YOU'VE GOT TO MOVE ON.

25:18.284 --> 25:20.885
     HOW COULD I MOVE ON
     WHEN YOU'RE THE ONE FOR ME?

25:20.887 --> 25:23.020
WILLIAM, WE BROKE UP
THREE MONTHS AGO.

25:23.022 --> 25:24.588
YOU'VE GOT TO STOP
DOING THIS.

25:24.590 --> 25:25.789
            COULD I HAVE A KISS?

25:25.791 --> 25:27.191
    NO!

25:27.193 --> 25:29.260
           SUDDENLY YOU'RE
           TOO GOOD TO KISS ME?

25:29.262 --> 25:31.929
       LET ME GUESS.
       YOU'RE ALREADY HOOKING UP
       WITH SOME NEW GUY, HUH?

25:31.931 --> 25:33.564
I'VE GOT TO GET TO WORK.

25:33.566 --> 25:35.699
       COME ON. YOU CAN TELL ME.

25:35.701 --> 25:38.168
    YOU'RE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE.

25:38.170 --> 25:40.571
           I COULD GIVE YOU
           A GOOD LIFE, SWEETIE.

25:40.573 --> 25:42.139
GOOD-BYE, WILLIAM.

25:46.878 --> 25:50.915
     AND THAT'S THE FLOUR. NOW,
     DON'T GET COCKY ABOUT THIS.

25:50.917 --> 25:52.850
       ALWAYS MEASURE THE WATER.

25:52.852 --> 25:54.184
    UH-HUH.

25:54.186 --> 25:55.886
           THIS TAP WATER IS
           OUR SECRET INGREDIENT

25:55.888 --> 25:57.221
            TO OUR GREAT-TASTING
            CRUST.

25:57.223 --> 25:58.689
      WOW.

25:58.691 --> 26:00.558
             SOME PEOPLE SAY
             IT'S THE OLD PIPES.

26:00.560 --> 26:02.192
        MIGHT BE THE POWER PLANT
        DOWN THE ROAD,

26:02.194 --> 26:05.029
       I DON'T KNOW. POUR IT IN.
       POUR IT IN THERE.

26:05.031 --> 26:07.264
         ABSOLUTELY. FIRST TIME.

26:09.901 --> 26:12.770
        THERE YOU GO! ALL RIGHT!

26:12.772 --> 26:15.239
     AH. DID YOU REALLY DO
     A LOT OF COOKING IN PRISON?

26:15.241 --> 26:17.808
         WHAT, NO? WHAT, YEAH,
         I WAS ONE OF THREE GUYS

26:17.810 --> 26:21.111
             AROUND THE KITCHEN.
             YEAH.

26:23.782 --> 26:25.616
  NOW, WHEN YOU WAIT
  ON CUSTOMERS,

26:25.618 --> 26:28.285
YOU ALWAYS GOTTA TRY
TO HAVE A GOOD ATTITUDE.

26:28.287 --> 26:30.688
I COULD DO EVERY JOB
HERE, OBVIOUSLY.

26:30.690 --> 26:32.790
THE BEST WAY FOR YOU
TO LEARN REAL FAST

26:32.792 --> 26:35.993
IS TO SHADOW ME, OBSERVE ME,
WATCH ME, OKAY?

26:35.995 --> 26:37.728
                       SURE.

26:50.343 --> 26:52.343
IT'S JUST A LOT OF GUYS
COME IN HERE,

26:52.345 --> 26:54.078
AND THEY DON'T TAKE
THE JOB SERIOUSLY.

26:54.080 --> 26:55.279
                       SURE.

26:55.281 --> 26:56.780

 YOU'VE GOT TO
 BE SHITTING ME, MAN.

27:03.155 --> 27:05.956
           WELL, I'M LIVING
           WITH MY SISTER, AND--

27:05.958 --> 27:08.659
         I'D ASK HER, BUT IT'S
         A LITTLE TENSE, AND I--

27:08.661 --> 27:10.694

27:11.998 --> 27:13.330
         YEAH. HOW DID YOU KNOW?

27:13.332 --> 27:15.165
DON'T FOOL WITH THE FOOLER!

27:15.167 --> 27:18.669
I'M A PUSSY GANGSTER
FROM WAY BACK, MAN. COME ON.

27:18.671 --> 27:22.139
ALL RIGHT. ONE TIME.
I'LL GIVE YOU AN ADVANCE.

27:22.141 --> 27:23.974
PLEASE DON'T ASK AGAIN.
OKAY?

27:23.976 --> 27:26.143
          AH, THANKS A LOT, MAN.

27:37.056 --> 27:39.923
     I'D TRUST

27:39.925 --> 27:41.659
               HIGHER POWER.
               I HEARD ALL ABOUT

27:41.661 --> 27:43.661
               THAT HIGHER POWER
               CRAP IN PRISON.

WRONG WITH THAT?

30:25.191 --> 30:27.424

           IT'S GREAT. I JUST--

30:27.426 --> 30:29.560

OH, HERE AND THERE.

30:45.311 --> 30:47.311

30:47.313 --> 30:48.512
     WHAT?

30:48.514 --> 30:51.515
               CULINARY SCHOOL.
               CHEF SCHOOL.

30:51.517 --> 30:55.118
OH, YEAH, SURE.
SORRY. I, I THOUGHT

30:55.120 --> 30:57.054
YOU SAID SOMETHING
DIFFERENT.

30:57.056 --> 30:58.889
WHAT ABOUT YOU,
WHAT, WHAT DO YOU DO?

30:58.891 --> 31:02.159
     ME? I AM A MORTGAGE BROKER.

31:02.161 --> 31:03.427
        OH.

31:03.429 --> 31:06.063
              YEAH. I KIND OF
              FELL INTO IT

31:06.065 --> 31:07.898
              AND WAS REALLY
              GOOD AT IT.

31:07.900 --> 31:09.399
       THEN THE COMPANY I WORKED
       FOR WENT BANKRUPT,

31:09.401 --> 31:12.002
            SO I WAS DEVASTATED.

31:12.004 --> 31:14.538
           UM, I DIDN'T THINK
           IT WOULD BE SOMETHING

31:14.540 --> 31:17.107
         I LOVED DOING, BUT WHEN
         THE COMPANY WENT UNDER

31:17.109 --> 31:18.976
             I ENDED UP GETTING
             A BETTER JOB OFFER.

31:18.978 --> 31:20.544
             SO, IT ALL
             KIND OF WORKED OUT.

31:20.546 --> 31:23.313
    YEAH.

31:23.315 --> 31:24.982
        DID THEY MAKE A MISTAKE?

31:24.984 --> 31:28.518
UH, NO, NO.
UH, NO, IT'S GOOD.

31:42.934 --> 31:44.468
              WELL, THANK YOU
              FOR DINNER.

31:46.472 --> 31:48.372

              FOR ME ONE DAY.

31:50.943 --> 31:52.142
YEAH.

31:52.144 --> 31:55.112
               THAT WAS A REALLY
               GOOD PLACE.

31:55.114 --> 31:57.681
IT WAS, YEAH.

31:57.683 --> 31:59.449
I HAD A REALLY
GOOD TIME.

31:59.451 --> 32:00.651

YOU ARE DANGEROUS.

32:26.277 --> 32:28.612
            I COULD COME IN
            FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

32:28.614 --> 32:31.448
ON THE FIRST DATE!

32:31.450 --> 32:33.684
WELL, WHAT KIND OF WOMAN
DO YOU THINK I AM?

32:33.686 --> 32:36.320
         ANYWHERE WHERE
         WE COULD WATCH SOME TV.

32:36.322 --> 32:38.188
   I'VE HEARD
   THAT ONE BEFORE.

32:38.190 --> 32:40.424
           YEAH? WELL, WE'LL
           LISTEN TO SOME MUSIC.

32:40.426 --> 32:42.492
WELL, I'VE HEARD
THAT ONE, TOO.

32:42.494 --> 32:45.062
                 COME ON.

32:45.064 --> 32:46.430
           I WON'T TRY ANYTHING.

32:46.432 --> 32:48.498
    THAT'S A LIE.

32:48.500 --> 32:49.967
               HALF A LIE.

32:49.969 --> 32:51.468
A LIE'S A LIE.

32:52.704 --> 32:54.705
NO, I HAVE TO GET UP EARLY.

32:57.308 --> 32:59.576
THERE IS SOMETHING
DIFFERENT ABOUT YOU.

33:01.012 --> 33:02.980
              IS THAT GOOD?

33:04.282 --> 33:05.682
        YEAH.

33:10.588 --> 33:12.689
GOOD NIGHT, VIAN.

33:14.125 --> 33:16.093
                 NIGHT.

33:20.264 --> 33:22.132
                        BYE.

34:03.374 --> 34:04.808
            CHECK THIS OUT.

34:04.810 --> 34:07.377
       HEY. YOU MAKE THIS PIZZA?

34:07.379 --> 34:08.678
     HUH? YEAH.

34:08.679 --> 34:10.547
          IT'S NOT COOKED.

34:10.549 --> 34:13.550
             WE WANT ANOTHER ONE
             THAT HAS HAM AND
             PINEAPPLE ON IT.

34:13.552 --> 34:15.152
YOU GUYS ATE HALF OF IT.

34:15.154 --> 34:17.187
YOU CAN SEE IT'S
COOKED ALL THE WAY.

34:18.523 --> 34:20.524
       SO WHAT? IT'S NOT COOKED.

34:20.525 --> 34:22.759
   I CAN'T DO IT.

34:22.761 --> 34:24.460
        YOU JUST WORK HERE.

34:24.463 --> 34:26.730
        THE HELL DIFFERENCE
        DOES IT MAKE TO YOU?

34:26.732 --> 34:29.331
  IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT.

34:33.304 --> 34:35.472
         NOW YOU KNOCKED IT
         ON THE GROUND.

34:35.474 --> 34:36.806
         WHAT'S THE MATTER
         WITH YOU?

34:36.809 --> 34:38.608
           HEY! WHAT'S GOING ON?

34:38.610 --> 34:41.078
      CHUM BOY YOU GOT
      UNDERCOOKED OUR PIZZA.

34:41.080 --> 34:42.279
            IS THAT TRUE?

34:42.281 --> 34:44.681
  NO.
         WHAT REALLY HAPPENED?

34:44.683 --> 34:47.583
    IT FELL.

34:47.585 --> 34:49.585
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

34:49.588 --> 34:51.420
           WE WANT A NEW ONE

34:51.422 --> 34:53.456
           WITH HAM AND
           PINEAPPLE ON IT.

34:55.359 --> 34:57.627
                 OKAY. I'LL MAKE
                 ANOTHER ONE.

34:57.629 --> 34:58.862
               SEE THAT, DOG?

34:58.864 --> 35:00.864
                THE CUSTOMER'S
                ALWAYS RIGHT.

35:09.640 --> 35:11.875
                HEY, HOW'D IT GO
                LAST NIGHT?

35:11.877 --> 35:14.845
  OH, IT WAS
  REALLY GOOD.

35:14.847 --> 35:17.114
                  HUH. GET SOME?

35:17.116 --> 35:19.616
  NO. IT WAS
  A FIRST DATE.

35:19.618 --> 35:22.419
           YEAH. I'LL NEVER BE
           ABLE TO KEEP A WOMAN.

35:22.421 --> 35:24.321
           I'M SERIOUS. AT FIRST
           IT'S ALWAYS GREAT,

35:24.323 --> 35:26.256
            BUT THEN THEY ALWAYS
            END UP DUMPING ME.

35:26.258 --> 35:28.125
THEN WHY DON'T YOU
DUMP THEM FIRST?

35:28.127 --> 35:29.593
              I TRIED, BUT
              THEY CAN SENSE IT,

35:29.595 --> 35:31.261
           AND THEN THEY GET ME.

35:32.464 --> 35:33.864
                      HEY! HI!

35:33.866 --> 35:35.265
                    HEY.

35:35.267 --> 35:37.367
     WHAT'S GOING ON?

35:37.369 --> 35:38.602
    MM.

35:38.604 --> 35:40.370
            UM, IT'S A LOT WORSE
            THAN I THOUGHT.

35:40.372 --> 35:41.771
OH, I'M SO SORRY.

35:41.773 --> 35:43.507
              YEAH. IT'S OKAY.
              I DIDN'T COME

35:43.509 --> 35:45.275
              TO BUM YOU OUT
              ABOUT MY DAD.

35:45.277 --> 35:48.411
NO, I'M GLAD YOU CAME.
OH, THAT'S VIAN.

35:48.413 --> 35:50.514
VIAN, UH,
THIS IS CHERRY.

35:50.516 --> 35:51.715
                   HEY.

35:51.717 --> 35:53.383
               HI.

35:53.385 --> 35:55.318
HER DAD IS REALLY SICK.

35:55.320 --> 35:57.621
                YEAH? SORRY.

35:57.623 --> 36:00.257
YEAH. HEY, YOU WANNA STAY
AND HAVE SOME LUNCH?

36:00.259 --> 36:02.492
             UH, NO. I WAS JUST
             DRIVING BY.

36:02.494 --> 36:03.927
              GOTTA GO SELL
              MY JEWELRY.

36:03.929 --> 36:05.595
 WHY?

36:05.597 --> 36:07.297
          I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE,
          YOU KNOW.

36:07.299 --> 36:09.166
THERE'S GOT TO BE
ANOTHER WAY.

36:09.168 --> 36:11.735
            I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
            AROUND LATELY.

36:11.737 --> 36:13.904
           IS THERE A NEW GIRL
           OR SOMETHING, OR...

36:13.906 --> 36:16.806
NO, NO. WELL,
I'VE BEEN WORKING A LOT,

36:16.808 --> 36:19.809
TRAINING HIM, BUT NO
OTHER GIRLS, YOU KNOW?

36:19.811 --> 36:22.445
         SO, YOU THINK WE CAN
         HANG OUT OR SOMETHING?

36:22.447 --> 36:25.215
YEAH. I'D LOVE
TO HANG OUT WITH YOU.

36:25.217 --> 36:27.217
IT WOULD BE GREAT.
OH, DON'T CRY.

36:27.219 --> 36:28.785
OH, MY GOSH.
IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

36:28.787 --> 36:31.354
          NO, IT'S NOT. YOU KNOW
          MY DAD'S SICK,

36:31.356 --> 36:34.191
             AND I DON'T HAVE
             MONEY, SO...

36:34.193 --> 36:35.792
OH... YOU KNOW WHAT?

36:35.794 --> 36:37.460
YOU KNOW...

36:37.462 --> 36:39.362
 YOU KNOW, I COULD...

36:39.364 --> 36:41.598
I COULD GIVE YOU...

36:41.600 --> 36:43.833
     600?

36:43.835 --> 36:45.902
             YEAH, BUT YOU DON'T
             HAVE TO DO THAT.

36:45.904 --> 36:47.604
I KNOW. I WANT TO.

36:47.606 --> 36:50.240
I, I--
IT'S AN HONOR.

36:50.242 --> 36:51.508
              ARE YOU SURE?

36:51.510 --> 36:52.909
I'M 100% SURE.

36:52.911 --> 36:54.678
                  OKAY.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.314
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
TONIGHT?

36:57.316 --> 36:59.282
               I DON'T KNOW.

36:59.284 --> 37:00.684
LET'S GET TOGETHER.

37:00.686 --> 37:02.485
              OH. YOU AND ME?

37:02.487 --> 37:03.954
YES. 9:00.
                   OKAY.

37:03.956 --> 37:06.356
9:00, CASEY'S, OKAY?
ME AND YOU.

37:06.358 --> 37:07.557
                   OKAY.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

37:07.559 --> 37:09.359
           THANKS. OKAY, THANKS.

37:09.361 --> 37:10.560
BYE NOW!

37:10.562 --> 37:12.295
                  BYE.

37:12.297 --> 37:14.965
       DON'T SAY A WORD!
       DON'T SAY A WORD.

37:14.967 --> 37:17.467
   I WASN'T GOING TO.

37:17.469 --> 37:20.904
       YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
       WE HAVE SOMETHING.

37:20.906 --> 37:23.306
       WE'VE GOT SOMETHING
       GOING ON HERE, MAN.

37:24.709 --> 37:27.510
        <i> THIS PLACE IS</i>
        <i> PRETTY COOL, HUH?</i>

37:27.512 --> 37:28.912
 SURE.

37:28.914 --> 37:30.847
         I'M GETTING THE CLUB
         SODA. WHAT DO YOU WANT?

37:30.849 --> 37:33.250
        YES. CLUB SODA
        IS GOOD.

37:33.252 --> 37:35.352
                TWO CLUB SODAS,
                JIMBO.

37:38.522 --> 37:41.424
  ALL THOSE SCHOOLKIDS,
  YOU JUST--

37:41.426 --> 37:43.460
   YOU JUST LET THEM
   ACT LIKE THAT?

37:43.462 --> 37:45.328
          THE AFTER-SCHOOL CROWD

37:45.330 --> 37:47.530
              IS A BIG PART
              OF OUR BUSINESS.

37:47.532 --> 37:49.366
   WHAT, THEY DO THAT
   ALL THE TIME?

37:49.368 --> 37:50.934
          NO, IT'S JUST
          A HAZING THING THEY DO

37:50.936 --> 37:53.770
             TO NEW EMPLOYEES.

37:53.772 --> 37:55.472
    WHAT'S HAZING?

37:55.474 --> 37:57.407
        WELL, THEY GIVE YOU SHIT
        FOR A LITTLE BIT

37:57.409 --> 37:59.376
         AND THEN THEY BACK OFF.

38:00.878 --> 38:02.912
THAT KID IS OUT OF LINE.

38:02.914 --> 38:05.415
          HIS FATHER IS THE D.A.

38:05.417 --> 38:06.850
         SO?

38:06.852 --> 38:09.419
             SO, YOU WANT TO GO
             BACK TO PRISON?

38:11.455 --> 38:13.890
      AH. I SEE HOW IT IS.

38:13.892 --> 38:16.326
    YOU KNOW, I USED TO BE
    IN A BAND.

38:16.328 --> 38:19.796
YEAH? WHAT KIND
OF BAND?

38:19.798 --> 38:21.898
    ROCK 'N ROLL, OBVIOUSLY.

38:21.900 --> 38:26.970
       YEAH. YEAH,
       THAT WAS MY DREAM.

38:26.972 --> 38:28.738
        NEVER THOUGHT I'D
        WIND UP MAKING PIZZAS.

38:28.740 --> 38:31.341
   WHAT HAPPENED TO THE BAND?

38:31.343 --> 38:33.510
         WELL, TURNS OUT
         I'M A LITTLE TONE DEAF,

38:33.512 --> 38:35.712
       BUT WE STILL GOT A LOT
       OF AMAZING OPPORTUNITIES,

38:35.714 --> 38:38.415
       WHICH I SCREWED UP 'CAUSE
       I WAS DRUNK ALL THE TIME.

38:38.417 --> 38:40.383
          I REMEMBER ONCE WE HAD
          THIS SHOW IN TIJUANA,

38:40.385 --> 38:42.886
         AND A LOT OF BIG PEOPLE
         CAME TO SEE US.

38:42.888 --> 38:45.555
      I'M OUT IN THE PARKING LOT
      TAKING A LEAK, AND A COP--

38:45.557 --> 38:47.624
          AND HE'S, LIKE,
          "WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"

38:47.626 --> 38:49.326
         I'M LIKE,
         "I'M MAKING A COCKTAIL.

38:49.328 --> 38:51.361
          YOU WANT ONE, SUCKER?"

38:51.363 --> 38:53.596
          SO, THE GOOD COP BEATS
          THE CRAP OUT OF ME,

38:53.598 --> 38:55.999
          TAKES ME TO JAIL. SO,
          I DO KNOW A LITTLE BIT

38:56.001 --> 38:58.468
         ABOUT LIFE BEHIND BARS.

38:58.470 --> 39:00.637
           SIX HOURS. BUT IT WAS
           A MEXICAN JAIL,

39:00.639 --> 39:02.539
       SO THAT'S LIKE DOG YEARS.

39:02.541 --> 39:03.840
      WOW.

39:03.842 --> 39:05.375
              ALL RIGHT.
              YOU WANT TO BREAK?

39:05.377 --> 39:06.876
  NO, YOU GO AHEAD.

39:06.878 --> 39:07.911
                           COOL.

39:10.815 --> 39:12.949
HEY, IT'S ME AGAIN.

39:12.951 --> 39:15.785
 SHE STILL DOESN'T
 PICK IT UP.

39:15.787 --> 39:17.721
            HAS SHE EVER
            STOOD YOU UP BEFORE?

39:17.723 --> 39:19.489
       YES.

39:19.491 --> 39:21.391
         WELL, SHE'S A STRIPPER.

39:21.393 --> 39:23.093
             WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?

39:23.095 --> 39:25.628
  I KNOW, BUT...

39:25.630 --> 39:28.732
YEAH, I WANT TO
BELIEVE IT BECAUSE...

39:28.734 --> 39:33.403
              YOU REALLY THINK
              HER DADDY'S SICK?

39:33.405 --> 39:35.071
   PROBABLY NOT.

39:36.640 --> 39:39.609
THERE'S ANOTHER TIME
I FELL FOR HER BULLSHIT.

39:39.611 --> 39:43.413
YOU KNOW, I...
I HAVE TO LET HER GO.

39:43.415 --> 39:45.014
I KEEP THINKING IF I DO
SOMETHING DIFFERENT,

39:45.016 --> 39:46.883
 THEN SHE'S GOING
 TO CHANGE.

39:46.885 --> 39:49.552
              A LEOPARD NEVER
              CHANGES ITS SPOTS.

39:51.722 --> 39:53.823
           I GOTTA CATCH MY BUS.

39:53.825 --> 39:55.558
I'LL GIVE YOU A RIDE.

39:55.560 --> 39:57.560
               SURE. LET'S GO.

40:09.974 --> 40:12.575
  UH, HEY, WE ALREADY
  ATE DINNER, SO--

40:12.577 --> 40:13.877
                 <i> HEY, I'M OKAY.</i>

40:16.480 --> 40:19.983
    OH, THIS IS ROLAND.
    I WORK FOR HIM.

40:19.985 --> 40:22.585
HEY. UH, BETHLEY.

40:22.587 --> 40:24.988
             BETHLEY. WELL,
             THAT'S A COOL NAME.

40:26.490 --> 40:29.092
THANKS FOR GIVING
MY BROTHER A JOB.

40:29.094 --> 40:30.560
                    <i> YEAH, YEAH.</i>

40:30.562 --> 40:32.162
              BEST GUY WE'VE HAD
              IN A LONG TIME.

40:32.164 --> 40:33.830
           I MEAN, I'M GRATEFUL.

40:33.832 --> 40:36.800
YEAH? YEAH, I'M GLAD
IT'S WORKING OUT.

40:36.802 --> 40:39.602
                YEAH. IT'S GOING
                VERY WELL.

40:39.604 --> 40:41.438
       OKAY. THANKS
       FOR THE LIFT.

40:41.440 --> 40:43.173
         OKAY. BYE, AND I'LL
         SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.

          HEY, I DON'T EVEN HAVE
          A CAR. WHERE THE FREAK

52:00.384 --> 52:02.284
              AM I GOING TO GET
              15 LARGE, HUH?

52:02.286 --> 52:04.153
I DON'T KNOW...
                       JEEZ.

52:04.155 --> 52:06.155
FAMILY OR FRIENDS?
I DON'T KNOW.

52:06.157 --> 52:07.523
                        YEAH.

52:07.525 --> 52:09.225
THE PROBLEM IS,
WHOEVER BUYS THIS PLACE

52:09.227 --> 52:10.759
IS PROBABLY
GOING TO FIRE US.

52:10.761 --> 52:12.161
                       YEAH?

52:12.163 --> 52:13.596
 YEAH.

52:13.598 --> 52:16.565
         SHOOT. MAYBE I SHOULD
         GO AND STICK UP A BANK.

52:16.567 --> 52:18.534
SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING
I WOULD'VE DONE

52:18.536 --> 52:20.703
 BACK IN THE DAY.

52:20.705 --> 52:22.304
                     NO KIDDING.

52:22.306 --> 52:25.241
YEAH. I GOT PRETTY BADASS
BEFORE I QUIT DRINKING.

52:25.243 --> 52:26.609
                        WOW.

52:26.611 --> 52:29.411
YEAH, IT'S CRAZY.
LITTLE METHAMPHETAMINE.

52:29.413 --> 52:33.816
YEAH. MY SISTER WAS A DEALER,
SO I GOT IT FOR FREE.

52:36.419 --> 52:39.522
HEY! YOU TWO LOVEBIRDS
OPEN FOR BUSINESS?

52:41.224 --> 52:43.926
                YEAH. WHAT
                WOULD YOU LIKE?

52:43.928 --> 52:47.163
I'D LIKE A LARGE

52:47.165 --> 52:49.632
AND EXTRA CHEESE.

52:49.634 --> 52:52.334
                   SURE.

52:52.336 --> 52:54.937
               THAT'S 16.67.

52:54.939 --> 52:56.539
 ALL RIGHT.

53:03.480 --> 53:06.749
I FORGOT MY WALLET.
CAN I GET YOU TOMORROW?

53:08.451 --> 53:09.652
    COME ON, LEE.

53:09.654 --> 53:11.754
    YOU KNOW WE DON'T
    DO THAT FOR ANYBODY.

53:11.756 --> 53:14.757
           OH, NO. I, I'LL
           TAKE HIS WORD FOR IT.

53:14.759 --> 53:16.859
  BUT IF HE STIFFS US--

53:16.861 --> 53:19.195
                 HE'S NOT GOING
                 TO STIFF US.

53:19.197 --> 53:20.462
        OKAY.

53:20.464 --> 53:22.898
  THANK YOU.

53:22.900 --> 53:24.967
           SURE. YOU'RE WELCOME.

53:27.270 --> 53:28.470

53:32.677 --> 53:34.276
              YOU'RE THE SECOND.

53:34.278 --> 53:35.511
    YOU'RE GONNA
    GET ME IN TROUBLE.

53:35.513 --> 53:37.546
MOM, CAN I HAVE
SOME MORE CAKE?

53:37.548 --> 53:40.382
       OH, HONEY, NO, NO, NO.
       SUGAR'S GOING TO KEEP YOU
       UP ALL NIGHT.

53:40.384 --> 53:41.784
     BETHLEY, THANK YOU
     SO MUCH FOR DINNER.

53:41.786 --> 53:43.619
  I CAN'T EVEN TOUCH DESSERT.

53:43.621 --> 53:45.387
               I KNOW. I HAVEN'T
               BEEN INVITED

53:45.389 --> 53:47.323
         TO A HOME-COOKED DINNER
         IN A LONG TIME.

53:47.325 --> 53:49.792
     NO? THEN YOU'RE GONNA
     JUST HAVE TO COME OVER

53:49.794 --> 53:51.860

54:12.916 --> 54:15.017
       HEY, YOU MIND IF
       I CHANGE THE MUSIC?

54:15.019 --> 54:17.753
                 SURE, GO AHEAD.

54:30.501 --> 54:32.835

55:13.376 --> 55:15.577
OH, YOUR SISTER'S GREAT!

55:15.579 --> 55:17.046
                    YEAH.

55:17.048 --> 55:18.714
    HOW LONG HAVE YOU
    LIVED WITH HER?

55:18.716 --> 55:20.849
                OH, NOT LONG.

55:20.851 --> 55:23.485
           I LIVE IN THE GARAGE.

55:23.487 --> 55:25.487
    OH, YOU CONVERTED
    THE GARAGE?

55:25.489 --> 55:27.723
                HUH. SORT OF.

<i> YEAH. TAKE A SEAT.</i>

             AH, YEAH. I USED TO
             DANCE A LOT.

55:48.379 --> 55:51.080
              NOT SO MUCH
              ANYMORE, YOU KNOW.

55:51.082 --> 55:53.015
YOU KNOW, I'M GOING

55:53.017 --> 55:54.483
                     WHAT?

               WELL, THE PARTY'S
               JUST STARTED.

55:56.420 --> 55:58.520
I KNOW. I KNOW.
I'VE GOT TO GET UP EARLY.

55:58.522 --> 56:00.589
            IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT!

56:00.591 --> 56:02.691
I HAVE A CARDIO CLASS
AT 8:00 A.M.

56:02.693 --> 56:03.959
                 WELL, SKIP IT.

56:03.961 --> 56:06.729
                 SKIP IT ONCE.
                 YOU'LL BE FINE.

56:06.731 --> 56:08.697
I WISH I COULD.

56:08.699 --> 56:11.500
BUT WE'LL TALK
TOMORROW, YEAH?

56:11.502 --> 56:12.701
                     SURE.

56:12.703 --> 56:13.902
     ALL RIGHT.

56:13.904 --> 56:15.104
                   OKAY.

56:15.106 --> 56:16.505
     GOOD NIGHT.

56:16.507 --> 56:18.474
                 UH, GOOD NIGHT.

56:39.629 --> 56:41.563
                   GOOD MORNING.

56:41.565 --> 56:43.565
MORNING, JIMMY.

56:43.567 --> 56:45.567
                ME AND MOM ARE
                GOING TO CHURCH.

56:45.569 --> 56:47.636
                DO YOU WANT
                TO COME WITH US?

56:47.638 --> 56:50.038
AIN'T NOTHING FOR ME
THERE.

56:50.040 --> 56:51.874
             IF MOM WILL LET ME,

56:51.876 --> 56:54.476
              WILL YOU TAKE ME
              TO THE LAKE LATER?

56:54.478 --> 56:56.478
 SURE, I WILL.

57:13.696 --> 57:16.064
HOW'S THE LAKE?

57:16.066 --> 57:18.600
IS IT STILL THE SAME?

57:18.602 --> 57:20.669
             YEAH, PRETTY MUCH.

57:22.205 --> 57:24.840
GRANDPA SHERM USED TO
TAKE ME HERE ALL THE TIME.

57:24.842 --> 57:26.875
HE SAID IT WAS MAGIC.

57:29.746 --> 57:32.481
HE PUT SOMETHING SPECIAL
UNDER THE ROCK HERE.

57:36.219 --> 57:39.555
               IT SURE IS GOOD
               TO HAVE A FRIEND.

57:39.557 --> 57:41.690
DON'T YOU HAVE
ANY FRIENDS AT SCHOOL?

57:41.692 --> 57:45.060
         NO. I DON'T HAVE THAT
         MANY FRIENDS AT SCHOOL.

57:45.062 --> 57:47.763
             THAT'S WHY I'M SO
             GLAD YOU SHOWED UP.

57:47.765 --> 57:50.799
         IT SURE IS GOOD TO HAVE
         A FRIEND IN LIFE.

57:50.801 --> 57:54.136
  YEAH. I'M GLAD
  WE'RE FRIENDS.

57:54.138 --> 57:56.104
              DID YOU EVER THINK
              THERE'S SOMETHING

57:56.106 --> 57:58.474
           BIGGER THAN
           THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD?

57:58.476 --> 58:02.578
      I DON'T KNOW.
      LIKE THE UNIVERSE?

58:02.580 --> 58:04.713
               LIKE, IT'S SO BIG
               AND AMAZING,

58:04.715 --> 58:06.682
          BUT NO ONE CAN SEE IT,

58:06.684 --> 58:08.750
            AND JUST EVERYWHERE.

58:11.087 --> 58:12.754
COME ON.

58:12.756 --> 58:14.890
                  GO FOR A PASS.

58:17.927 --> 58:19.595
   HOW DID YOU
   FIND THIS OUT?

58:19.597 --> 58:22.564
                I HAVE PEOPLE.

58:22.566 --> 58:24.766
  HE WAS IN PRISON?

58:24.768 --> 58:26.635
                 KILLED A GUY.

58:27.937 --> 58:30.072
        WHAT?

58:30.074 --> 58:32.641
           SECOND-DEGREE MURDER.

58:32.643 --> 58:36.812
       BEAT A GUY TO DEATH.
       SPENT 12 YEARS IN PRISON.

58:38.515 --> 58:40.916
                JUST LOOKING OUT
                FOR YOU, JO.

58:45.722 --> 58:48.657
               THIS IS AN EX-CON
               MURDERER.

58:48.659 --> 58:50.259
              HE SHOULD AT LEAST
              HAVE THE DECENCY

58:50.261 --> 58:52.127
          TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

58:58.101 --> 58:59.935
 I WANT YOU TO GO.

59:03.139 --> 59:04.973
             YOU DON'T WANT
             TO TALK ABOUT THIS?

59:06.609 --> 59:08.610
     JUST GO.

59:11.881 --> 59:13.615
                  BABY, LISTEN--

59:13.617 --> 59:16.585
DON'T TOUCH ME. JUST GO.

59:29.098 --> 59:31.099
           HEY, I THINK I'VE GOT
           SOME BAD NEWS.

59:31.101 --> 59:33.335
             WHAT?

59:33.337 --> 59:35.103
       I THINK THE OLD MAN FOUND
       A BUYER FOR THIS PLACE.

59:35.105 --> 59:36.738
  <i> YEAH?</i>

59:36.740 --> 59:39.708
         YEAH. WERE YOU ABLE TO
         COME UP WITH ANY MONEY?

59:39.710 --> 59:42.210
HEY, I TOLD YOU, I DON'T
HAVE THAT KIND OF MONEY.

59:42.212 --> 59:44.212
               WELL, HE'S
               GOING TO SELL IT.

59:44.214 --> 59:46.848
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

59:46.850 --> 59:48.850
                MAYBE GET A JOB
                AT ONE OF THOSE

59:48.852 --> 59:51.086
                FAST FOOD PLACES
                OUT BY THE MALL.

59:51.088 --> 59:53.221
YOU THINK THEY'LL HIRE ME?

59:53.223 --> 59:55.791
                  PROBABLY.

59:55.793 --> 59:58.193
            HEY, WHAT'S THE DEAL
            WITH YOUR SISTER?

59:58.195 --> 01:00:00.796
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

01:00:00.798 --> 01:00:02.764
              I MEAN, SHE SEEMS
              REALLY COOL.

01:00:04.334 --> 01:00:06.234
HEY, YOU KEEP AWAY
FROM HER.

01:00:08.272 --> 01:00:10.138
WHAT THE F IS SO FUNNY?

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:12.641
             I ASSUME
             WE'RE ADULTS HERE.

01:00:15.244 --> 01:00:17.145
SHE'S NOT FOR YOU.

01:00:17.147 --> 01:00:19.314
            A LITTLE JUDGMENTAL,
            COMING FROM YOU.

01:00:19.316 --> 01:00:21.650
HEY, YOU GO OUT
WITH BIMBO STRIPPERS.

01:00:21.652 --> 01:00:23.719
SHE'S A GOOD WOMAN,
OKAY?

01:00:23.721 --> 01:00:25.854
SHE HAS A SON.

01:00:25.856 --> 01:00:28.223
HER HUSBAND RAN OFF
WITH SOME SKANKPOT.

01:00:28.225 --> 01:00:31.026
WON'T EVEN PAY CHILD SUPPORT.

01:00:31.028 --> 01:00:33.629
               AND YOU PUT ME
               IN THAT CATEGORY?

01:00:33.631 --> 01:00:35.831
  NO.

01:00:35.833 --> 01:00:38.000
       WE'RE NOT GOING TO TALK
       ABOUT THIS ANYMORE, OKAY?

01:00:38.002 --> 01:00:40.268
         I ONLY BROUGHT IT UP
         OUT OF RESPECT FOR YOU.

01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:42.270
GOOD. SO NOW YOU KNOW.

01:00:42.272 --> 01:00:43.672
                    <i> YEAH, I DO.</i>

01:00:43.674 --> 01:00:45.007
KEEP THE F AWAY FROM HER.

01:00:45.009 --> 01:00:46.408
             OR WHAT, YOU'RE
             GONNA KICK MY ASS?

01:00:46.410 --> 01:00:48.343
YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

01:00:48.345 --> 01:00:50.846
         IS THAT A THREAT, VIAN?
         ARE YOU THREATENING ME
         RIGHT NOW?

01:00:50.848 --> 01:00:52.347
BACK OFF, ROLAND.

01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:55.417
          YOU KNOW WHAT?
          MAYBE I MISJUDGED YOU.

01:00:55.419 --> 01:00:57.185
   MAYBE WE DON'T WORK TOGETHER.

01:00:57.187 --> 01:00:58.987
   YEAH? WHAT?

01:00:58.989 --> 01:01:01.023
YOU'RE GONNA FIRE ME?

01:01:01.025 --> 01:01:03.158
JUST BECAUSE I DON'T
WANT YOU TO GO OFF
WITH MY SISTER?

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.427
         YOU USED TO BE THE BOSS
         IN PRISON, I'M SURE,

01:01:05.429 --> 01:01:07.763
         BUT YOU'RE NOT
         THE FREAKING BOSS HERE!

01:01:07.765 --> 01:01:09.064
                    I AM!

01:01:09.066 --> 01:01:11.066
HEY, FORGET YOU, ROLAND.

01:01:11.068 --> 01:01:12.901
I DON'T NEED THIS SHAM.

01:01:12.903 --> 01:01:15.203
           THAT'S GOOD,
           BECAUSE YOU'RE FIRED!

01:01:15.205 --> 01:01:17.172
YEAH? SCREW YOU!

01:01:17.174 --> 01:01:18.373
                SCREW YOU!

01:01:18.375 --> 01:01:19.841
     SCREW YOU!

01:01:27.817 --> 01:01:29.951
YEAH, I'M JUST
DOWN THE STREET.

01:01:31.287 --> 01:01:33.155
    YEAH.

01:01:33.157 --> 01:01:35.257
I COULD COME OVER
AND SAY HI.

01:01:37.794 --> 01:01:40.262
YEAH? THAT'S COOL.

01:01:41.464 --> 01:01:44.099
SURE. I'LL BE THERE
IN TEN MINUTES.

01:01:44.101 --> 01:01:46.101
 YEAH. BYE.

01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:50.972
               <i> WHAT'S GOING ON?</i>

01:01:50.974 --> 01:01:53.709
NOTHING. I'M JUST
GETTING READY FOR WORK.

01:01:55.344 --> 01:01:57.479
                WHAT'S WRONG?

01:01:57.481 --> 01:02:01.216
I, UM... I DON'T THINK
THIS IS WORKING.

01:02:03.419 --> 01:02:05.454
              WE JUST STARTED
              SEEING EACH OTHER.

01:02:05.456 --> 01:02:06.888
   IT'S NOT YOU.

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:08.390
              <i> WHAT IS IT, THEN?</i>

01:02:08.392 --> 01:02:10.425
 I JUST CAN'T
 DO THIS ANYMORE.

01:02:10.427 --> 01:02:13.261
I'M MESSED UP, AND
I SHOULDN'T BE SEEING
ANYONE RIGHT NOW.

01:02:14.464 --> 01:02:16.331
              BUT WHAT DID I DO?

01:02:16.333 --> 01:02:18.166
NOTHING. NOTHING.
I'M JUST...

01:02:18.168 --> 01:02:20.001
 I'M IN A BAD PLACE,

01:02:20.003 --> 01:02:21.937
AND I NEVER SHOULD'VE
GONE OUT WITH YOU

01:02:21.939 --> 01:02:24.106
IN THE FIRST PLACE,
AND I'M REALLY SORRY.

01:02:26.342 --> 01:02:27.876
              THERE'S SOMETHING
              GOING ON,

01:02:27.878 --> 01:02:29.978
          AND YOU DON'T WANT
          TO TELL ME WHAT IT IS.

01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:32.948
         SO, I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

01:02:39.388 --> 01:02:42.023
                CAN I HELP YOU?

01:02:42.025 --> 01:02:45.460
           YEAH.

01:02:45.462 --> 01:02:47.963
               WHAT DO YOU NEED?

01:02:47.965 --> 01:02:49.798
           I, UH...

01:02:54.103 --> 01:02:55.904
        AH, NOTHING.

01:03:01.779 --> 01:03:03.445
               YOU'RE AN ABACUS?

01:03:03.447 --> 01:03:07.349
     I DO! I HAVE A STONE
     IN THE NECK. OH, MY GOSH.

01:03:08.786 --> 01:03:10.418
                   <i> HEY, VI.</i>
                           <i> HEY!</i>

01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:11.953
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:03:11.955 --> 01:03:14.422
         HAVING A CUP OF COFFEE.

01:03:14.424 --> 01:03:15.824
   GET OUT OF HERE.

01:03:15.826 --> 01:03:17.125
                    NO, COME ON.

01:03:17.127 --> 01:03:19.060
         YOU KNOW WHAT?
         I TRIED TO TALK TO YOU,

01:03:19.062 --> 01:03:20.295
            BE STRAIGHT ABOUT
            LIKING YOUR SISTER--

01:03:20.297 --> 01:03:21.897
GET THE HELL OUT OF HER!

01:03:21.899 --> 01:03:24.833
                <i> HEY! HEY! VIAN,</i>
                <i> THAT'S ENOUGH.</i>

01:03:24.835 --> 01:03:26.835
          WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

01:03:26.837 --> 01:03:28.804
                  MAYBE YOU NEED
                  TO GO, OKAY?

01:03:28.806 --> 01:03:30.372
            YOU GET OUT OF HERE,
            ALL RIGHT?

01:03:30.374 --> 01:03:33.141
   THIS IS MY HOUSE, OKAY?
   YOU DON'T EVEN PAY RENT HERE.

01:03:33.143 --> 01:03:35.477
                YEAH, ALL RIGHT?
                YOU DON'T KNOW
                WHAT IT'S LIKE.

01:03:35.479 --> 01:03:37.245
           YOU DON'T KNOW
           WHAT MY LIFE IS LIKE,

01:03:37.247 --> 01:03:39.047
         WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH,
         WHAT IT'S LIKE

01:03:39.049 --> 01:03:41.149
            TO RAISE A KID ON
            MY OWN WITH NO HELP!

01:03:41.151 --> 01:03:42.551
    SHUT UP.

01:03:42.553 --> 01:03:45.187
         WHERE WERE YOU, HUH?
         SO YOU DON'T GET TO SAY

01:03:45.189 --> 01:03:47.889
         ANYTHING ABOUT HOW I DO
         THINGS. DO YOU GET IT?

01:03:47.891 --> 01:03:51.159
             YOU LOST THAT RIGHT
             A LONG TIME AGO!

01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:57.132
                YEAH! OH, YEAH,
                THAT'S GREAT.

01:03:57.134 --> 01:03:59.134
                JUST LEAVE!

01:03:59.136 --> 01:04:01.069
     DON'T EVEN DEAL WITH IT
     'CAUSE IT'S WORKED OUT

01:04:01.071 --> 01:04:03.104
     SO WELL FOR YOU
     YOUR WHOLE LIFE!

01:04:08.878 --> 01:04:11.580
         UNCLE VI, I BROUGHT YOU
         A CUP OF COFFEE.

01:04:14.116 --> 01:04:15.317
        HEY, JIMMY.

01:04:17.954 --> 01:04:19.354
        THANKS.

01:04:22.525 --> 01:04:25.460
     MM. IT'S NOT BAD.
     DID YOU MAKE IT?

01:04:25.462 --> 01:04:26.895
                   YEAH.

01:04:26.897 --> 01:04:29.865
            YOU EVER READ
            THE BOOK I GAVE YOU?

01:04:29.867 --> 01:04:31.867
ABOUT THE OLD MAN?

01:04:31.869 --> 01:04:33.568
              YEAH, "THE OLD MAN
              AND THE SEA."

01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:37.339
  NO, I HAVEN'T
  STARTED IT YET.

01:04:37.341 --> 01:04:40.008
         I THINK YOU'LL LIKE IT,
         ESPECIALLY THE END.

01:04:41.944 --> 01:04:43.478
    YEAH.

01:04:48.484 --> 01:04:51.286
                 WHAT'S WRONG?

01:04:51.288 --> 01:04:53.221
    OH, I JUST WANT
    TO BE SOMEONE,

01:04:53.223 --> 01:04:55.290
    MAKE SOMETHING
    OF MY LIFE.

01:04:58.527 --> 01:05:01.062
 THOUGHT I COULD BE
 A FIGHTER, BUT,

01:05:01.064 --> 01:05:03.565
I DON'T KNOW. JUST...

01:05:03.567 --> 01:05:07.535
IT PRETTY MUCH SEEMS
I'VE AMOUNTED TO NOTHING.

01:05:07.537 --> 01:05:10.138
   JUST SOME...

01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:13.141
  BROKEN DOWN GUY
  LIVING IN A GARAGE.

01:05:13.143 --> 01:05:17.045
     BUT UNCLE VI, YOU'RE
     THE BEST FRIEND I EVER HAD.

01:05:17.047 --> 01:05:19.614
 YEAH, BUT YOU'RE
 JUST A KID.

01:05:19.616 --> 01:05:21.650
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU KNOW?

01:05:31.661 --> 01:05:33.261
        HEY, GO GET US
        A TABLE, WOULD YA?

01:05:42.638 --> 01:05:44.139
               WHAT DO YOU WANT?

01:05:44.141 --> 01:05:46.608
           I WANT A LARGE
           EXTRA CHEESE

01:05:46.610 --> 01:05:48.543
           WITH SAUSAGE
           AND MUSHROOM.

01:05:50.279 --> 01:05:53.081
        HEY, WHERE'S VIAN?

01:05:53.083 --> 01:05:55.050
                 HE DOESN'T WORK
                 HERE ANYMORE.

01:05:55.052 --> 01:05:56.418
              WHY?

01:05:56.420 --> 01:05:58.320
                    HE MOVED ON.

01:05:58.322 --> 01:06:00.088
   HE'S THE BEST GUY
   YOU EVER HAD!

01:06:00.090 --> 01:06:02.023
        WELL, HE DOESN'T WORK
        HERE ANYMORE, ALL RIGHT?

01:06:02.025 --> 01:06:03.258
                       SIT DOWN.

01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:38.560
           WHAT, UH-- WHAT
           DO THE TESTS SAY?

01:06:38.562 --> 01:06:41.629
THERE'S SLIGHT
HEMORRHAGING
ON THE BRAIN.

01:06:41.631 --> 01:06:43.064
                 OH, NO.

01:06:43.066 --> 01:06:46.001
THIS IS NOT UNUSUAL
IN BRAIN TRAUMA.

01:06:46.003 --> 01:06:49.004
           UM, WHEN WILL HE
           COME OUT OF THE COMA?

01:06:49.006 --> 01:06:52.374
WELL, THAT I CAN'T
TELL YOU EXACTLY.

01:06:52.376 --> 01:06:55.343
              DAYS? ARE WE
              TALKING WEEKS?

01:06:55.345 --> 01:06:57.212
ONLY TIME CAN TELL.

01:06:57.214 --> 01:06:59.147
               OUR FATHER
               WHO ART IN HEAVEN

01:06:59.149 --> 01:07:01.149

            THY WILL BE DONE

01:07:02.753 --> 01:07:04.753
  ON EARTH AS IT IS IN HEAVEN.

01:07:04.755 --> 01:07:06.755
      GIVE US THIS DAY...

01:07:33.249 --> 01:07:35.250
                  OH, JIMMY.

01:07:38.754 --> 01:07:41.756
               JIMMY, I LOVE YOU
               SO MUCH.

01:07:48.097 --> 01:07:49.631
          WHAT TIME IS IT?

01:07:49.633 --> 01:07:51.800
                   I DON'T KNOW.

01:07:53.335 --> 01:07:55.103
                <i> SOMETIME</i>
                <i> IN THE MORNING.</i>

01:07:55.105 --> 01:07:57.806
  OH. I'VE GOT TO CALL WORK
  AND TELL THEM WHAT HAPPENED.

01:08:02.178 --> 01:08:03.778
         I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:06.081
                         SURE.

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:33.308
THIS IS A HOSPITAL?

01:08:33.310 --> 01:08:35.243
                  HEY, JIMMY.

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:40.281
I WAS DREAMING AND
IN THE SPECIAL PLACE.

01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:42.750
EVERYTHING IS PERFECT.

01:08:42.752 --> 01:08:45.153
THE LAKE...
AND THE ROCK!

01:08:45.154 --> 01:08:47.354
THE ROCK IS RIGHT THERE
FOR YOU AND MY MOM!

01:08:47.357 --> 01:08:49.491
                     SURE.

01:08:52.495 --> 01:08:54.496
I SURE COULD GO
FOR SOMETHING TO EAT.

01:08:54.497 --> 01:08:56.331
DO YOU WANT TO EAT
WITH ME?

01:08:56.332 --> 01:08:58.666
                   SURE.

01:08:58.667 --> 01:09:01.236
              ANYTHING YOU WANT.

01:09:01.238 --> 01:09:03.571
 PEOPLE CAN BE
 SO SILLY,

01:09:03.573 --> 01:09:05.340
 ALL TRAPPED UP
 IN THEIR MINDS,

01:09:05.341 --> 01:09:07.509
AND FISHES JUST KEEP
SWIMMING, AND GRASSHOPPERS

01:09:07.511 --> 01:09:09.877
ARE TALKING NICE,
VERY NICE.

01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:11.679
HEY!

01:09:12.881 --> 01:09:14.682
SWEETHEART!

01:09:14.684 --> 01:09:17.652
       I KEPT TRYING TO TELL YOU
       I WAS OKAY, MOM.

01:09:17.654 --> 01:09:20.488
    YOU DID. YES, YOU DID.

01:09:20.490 --> 01:09:22.724
      BUT I HAVE TO GO HOME NOW.

01:09:22.725 --> 01:09:25.560
     YES! OF COURSE,

01:09:25.562 --> 01:09:27.795
  I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU HOME.
  BABY, I LOVE YOU.

01:09:27.796 --> 01:09:29.663
  I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:31.633
           I LOVE YOU, TOO, MOM.

01:09:31.635 --> 01:09:33.401
            LOVE IS REALLY GOOD.

01:09:33.403 --> 01:09:36.304
        OH...

01:09:36.305 --> 01:09:38.606
     BABY? JIMMY?

01:09:39.875 --> 01:09:41.743
JIMMY? NO, NO, NO, NO.

01:09:41.745 --> 01:09:43.511
JIMMY? JIMMY, COME BACK.
COME ON, HONEY.

01:09:43.513 --> 01:09:46.247
COME ON, SWEETHEART.
COME BACK. VIAN--

01:09:46.249 --> 01:09:47.782
               GO GET SOMEBODY.
               GET THE DOCTOR.

01:09:47.783 --> 01:09:49.783
               WE NEED A DOCTOR,
               PLEASE!

01:09:49.786 --> 01:09:52.854
HEY. COME ON, BABY.
COME ON.

01:09:52.856 --> 01:09:55.223
COME ON, SWEETHEART,
WAKE BACK UP.

01:09:55.225 --> 01:09:57.525
                    I, I DON'T
                    UNDERSTAND.

01:09:57.527 --> 01:10:01.529
      A SURGE. IT'S NOT
      COMMON, BUT IT DOES HAPPEN
      WITH PEOPLE IN A COMA.

01:10:01.531 --> 01:10:03.331
     A SUDDEN SURGE OF ENERGY,

01:10:03.333 --> 01:10:05.300
         A BRIEF MOMENT
         OF CONSCIOUSNESS,

01:10:05.302 --> 01:10:07.802
    AND THEN THEY LAPSE BACK
    INTO THEIR COMA STATE.

01:10:07.804 --> 01:10:10.238
             BUT WHY, AND WHY
             FOR JUST A MINUTE--

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:13.374
IT'S NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD.

01:10:13.376 --> 01:10:15.443
                 IT DOESN'T MAKE
                 ANY SENSE.

01:10:25.588 --> 01:10:27.222
                   YOU OKAY?

01:10:28.557 --> 01:10:30.892
              NO.

01:10:30.894 --> 01:10:33.661
         I'M NOT OKAY.

01:10:43.639 --> 01:10:47.709
I'M GONNA GO INSIDE AND...

01:10:47.711 --> 01:10:51.546
   TAKE A SHOWER
   AND THEN GO BACK.

01:10:52.881 --> 01:10:55.250
               I'LL GO WITH YOU.

01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:30.351
      DEAR GOD,
      I WANT TO SAY A PRAYER

01:11:30.353 --> 01:11:35.556
    THAT YOU WATCH OVER JIMMY

01:11:35.558 --> 01:11:38.593
    AND THE REST OF MY FAMILY.

01:11:41.530 --> 01:11:45.867
  I KNOW THAT, WHATEVER HAPPENS,
  IT'S YOUR WILL,

01:11:45.869 --> 01:11:48.803
     AND I HAVE TO TRUST THAT.

01:11:51.373 --> 01:11:55.343
  AND ALTHOUGH I FEEL ALONE,
  I KNOW THAT YOU'RE THERE, GOD.

01:11:57.446 --> 01:11:59.347
            I DON'T...

01:12:02.985 --> 01:12:06.387
     I JUST DON'T KNOW
     IF I'LL BE ABLE TO MAKE IT.

01:12:09.858 --> 01:12:15.697
       I DON'T KNOW ANYMORE.
       I DON'T KNOW HOW.

01:12:46.695 --> 01:12:48.129
                  HELLO?

01:12:50.733 --> 01:12:52.066

               VIAN? VIAN!

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:35.977
HE'S GONE!

01:13:40.182 --> 01:13:42.150
               HE'S GONE.

01:14:31.099 --> 01:14:32.867
                  AH.

WE HAD A DEAL YOU COULD
STAY HERE IF YOU DIDN'T DRINK.

01:15:57.319 --> 01:16:00.621
                THAT'S OKAY.

01:16:00.623 --> 01:16:02.857
  YOU NEED TO GO, VIAN.

01:16:02.859 --> 01:16:04.825
            WHERE AM I GONNA GO?

01:16:04.827 --> 01:16:06.761
HUH?

01:16:06.763 --> 01:16:09.230
   I NEED YOU TO LEAVE.

01:16:09.232 --> 01:16:12.567
           IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

01:16:12.569 --> 01:16:14.602
        IT'S NO BIG DEAL AT ALL.

01:16:14.604 --> 01:16:16.270
                   COME ON.

01:16:16.272 --> 01:16:18.272
DON'T. DON'T COME NEAR ME!

01:16:18.274 --> 01:16:21.075
                WHY ARE YOU
                SO UPTIGHT? HEY!

01:16:40.329 --> 01:16:42.363
         I GOTTA FIND SOMETHING.

01:17:02.618 --> 01:17:04.318
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING
TO DRINK?

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:07.655
      I HAVE SOMEONE COMING OVER
      IN A FEW MINUTES.

01:17:07.657 --> 01:17:10.391
 YOU HAVE A NEW GUY
 ALREADY? WOW.

01:17:13.796 --> 01:17:15.830
THAT DIDN'T TAKE
BUT A HOT SECOND

01:17:15.832 --> 01:17:18.633
FOR SOME OTHER SUCKER
TO START GIVING YOU
THE HARD ONE.

01:17:18.635 --> 01:17:20.234
               YOU KNOW WHAT?
               YOU'RE DRUNK,

01:17:20.236 --> 01:17:22.203
             AND I THINK
             YOU SHOULD GET OUT.

01:17:22.205 --> 01:17:25.039
I NEED A PLACE TO STAY
FOR THE NIGHT.

01:17:25.041 --> 01:17:27.074
  CAN I STAY HERE
  FOR THE NIGHT?

01:17:27.076 --> 01:17:28.843
                       NO.

01:17:28.845 --> 01:17:30.244
   OH, COME ON.

01:17:30.246 --> 01:17:32.647
               DO YOU HAVE
               ANY SELF-RESPECT?

01:17:32.649 --> 01:17:35.016
HEY, WHA-- YOU KNOW,
I DON'T NEED YOU.

01:17:35.018 --> 01:17:37.718
 I DON'T NEED THIS SHIT.

01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:40.187
YOU KNOW, I'D COME
OVER HERE THINKING

01:17:40.189 --> 01:17:44.792
MAYBE, MAYBE WE HAD
SOMETHING GOING.

01:17:44.794 --> 01:17:47.128
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE DON'T.

01:17:47.130 --> 01:17:49.030
WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
GOING, DO WE?

01:17:49.032 --> 01:17:51.298
                 NO, WE DON'T.

01:17:55.037 --> 01:17:56.437
I DON'T NEED YOU.

01:17:56.439 --> 01:17:58.205
IF YOU WANTED
TO BE BACK WITH ME,

01:17:58.207 --> 01:18:00.441
 I WOULDN'T EVEN WANT
 TO BE WITH YOU.

01:18:00.443 --> 01:18:03.377
YOU, YOU JERK MY CHAIN

01:18:03.379 --> 01:18:06.080
AND ACT LIKE
YOU'RE INTO ME.

01:18:06.082 --> 01:18:08.049
  WHAT A JOKE.

01:18:11.353 --> 01:18:13.054
YOU HAVE ANYTHING

01:18:13.056 --> 01:18:15.222
                 NO. GET OUT.

01:18:16.725 --> 01:18:19.060
 DON'T YOU CALL ME.

01:18:20.696 --> 01:18:23.264
YOU DON'T CALL ME NO MORE.

01:18:23.266 --> 01:18:25.032
I'M DONE WITH YOU.

01:19:01.837 --> 01:19:04.271

SO START WRAPPING IT UP!

01:19:07.342 --> 01:19:10.144

01:19:18.387 --> 01:19:20.054
         LEAVE YOU ALONE?

01:19:20.056 --> 01:19:22.056
         ARE YOU STUPID
         OR SOMETHING?

01:19:22.058 --> 01:19:23.958
       I TOLD YOU NOT

01:19:36.906 --> 01:19:38.305
               GET OFF OF ME!

01:19:38.307 --> 01:19:41.142
                 <i> YEAH, HIT HIM!</i>

01:19:41.144 --> 01:19:42.977
                 <i> HIT HIM AGAIN!</i>

01:19:48.817 --> 01:19:50.317
          ALL RIGHT. THAT'S
          ENOUGH, THAT'S ENOUGH.

01:19:50.319 --> 01:19:52.353
               COME ON! COME ON!

01:19:52.355 --> 01:19:54.789
      DON'T BRING YOUR FOOT

01:19:56.858 --> 01:19:58.292
          SCREW HIM, MAN!

01:20:04.833 --> 01:20:07.501
   DID YOU SPEAK TO THE COPS?

01:20:07.503 --> 01:20:09.236
                  <i> CHARGING YOU</i>
                  <i> WITH FELONY</i>

01:20:09.238 --> 01:20:11.138
          <i> AND ASSAULT</i>
          <i> WITH A DEADLY WEAPON.</i>

01:20:13.942 --> 01:20:15.943
             YEAH.

01:20:15.945 --> 01:20:18.546
    GUESS I'LL BE GOING AWAY
    FOR A LONG WHILE.

01:20:20.081 --> 01:20:22.349
   THAT'S OKAY.

01:20:22.351 --> 01:20:24.318
 YOU GUYS CAN LEAVE.

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:27.555
   JIMMY'S FUNERAL
   IS TODAY.

01:20:31.526 --> 01:20:33.494
    I WISH I COULD MAKE IT.

01:20:33.496 --> 01:20:37.331
YEAH, I KNOW YOU'LL

01:20:37.333 --> 01:20:40.835
         HEY, VIAN. YOU KNOW

01:20:40.837 --> 01:20:42.036
   YEAH?

01:20:42.038 --> 01:20:43.337
         WELL, I'M AN ALCOHOLIC.

01:20:43.339 --> 01:20:45.172
               I'VE BEEN SOBER
               18 YEARS, AND--

01:20:45.174 --> 01:20:47.908
 STUFF YOUR MEETINGS

01:20:49.211 --> 01:20:52.146
I TOLD YOU I DIDN'T
WANT YOU TO SEE MY SISTER!

01:20:59.554 --> 01:21:01.222
      LET'S GO.

01:21:58.914 --> 01:22:01.482
              HEY, UNCLE VI.

01:22:01.484 --> 01:22:02.983
      JIMMY?

01:22:02.985 --> 01:22:05.920
               IT'S OKAY.

01:22:07.255 --> 01:22:09.223
 WHAT'S GOING ON?
 IS THIS A DREAM?

01:22:09.225 --> 01:22:11.258
           I CAME TO TELL YOU
           THAT'S IT'S ALL OKAY,

01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:13.060
             AND EVERYTHING
             IS PERFECT.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.168
BUT YOU'RE NOT ALIVE.

01:22:21.170 --> 01:22:22.536
                 I'M RIGHT HERE.

01:22:22.538 --> 01:22:24.405
                I TALKED TO YOUR
                MOM AND DAD.

01:22:24.407 --> 01:22:26.173
                THEY SAY
                THEY LOVE YOU.

01:22:26.175 --> 01:22:28.509
              GRANDPA SHERM,
              HE SAYS HE'S SORRY

01:22:28.511 --> 01:22:30.978
               THAT HE BEAT YOU.

01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:33.647
YEAH? WELL,
IF HE'S SO SORRY,

01:22:33.649 --> 01:22:36.417
HOW COME
HE NEVER TOLD ME?

01:22:36.419 --> 01:22:38.953
            HE DID. HE WROTE YOU
            IN PRISON,

01:22:38.955 --> 01:22:40.554
                WHEN YOU WERE
                TOO MAD AT HIM,

01:22:40.556 --> 01:22:42.289
                THAT YOU DIDN'T
                OPEN HIS LETTER.

01:22:42.291 --> 01:22:43.958
HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT?

01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:45.492
                   I KNOW.

01:22:45.494 --> 01:22:49.596
I'M SORRY FOR
WHAT I SAID ABOUT YOU,

01:22:49.598 --> 01:22:52.166
ABOUT YOU
JUST BEING A KID.

01:22:52.168 --> 01:22:55.302
             IT'S OKAY.
             I KNOW YOU LOVE ME.

01:22:57.572 --> 01:22:59.139
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

01:22:59.141 --> 01:23:01.675
              I HAD A FEW THINGS
              TO TELL YOU.

01:23:01.677 --> 01:23:04.578
   MAN...

01:23:04.580 --> 01:23:09.149
  I'M SO HAPPY
  TO SEE YOU...

01:23:09.151 --> 01:23:13.120
EVEN IF THIS IS SOME
KINDA WEIRD DREAM.

01:23:13.122 --> 01:23:15.723
            MY MOM, SHE NEEDS
            YOUR LOVE RIGHT NOW.

01:23:15.725 --> 01:23:19.426
I'M GOING BACK TO PRISON.
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING.

01:23:19.428 --> 01:23:21.228
        JUST TRUST THAT YOU CAN.

01:23:21.230 --> 01:23:22.763
TRUST THAT I CAN DO WHAT?

01:23:22.765 --> 01:23:25.399
               THAT YOU CAN DO
               ANYTHING.

01:23:25.401 --> 01:23:28.235
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT, JIMMY?

01:23:28.237 --> 01:23:30.104
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

01:23:30.106 --> 01:23:32.206
               JUST TRUST THAT
               IT WILL BE THERE.

01:23:32.208 --> 01:23:35.209
TRUST WHAT WILL BE WHERE?

01:23:35.211 --> 01:23:37.611
   I'LL SEE YOU LATER, UNCLE VI.

01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:08.375
         YOU HAVE BEEN
         RELEASED.

01:24:08.377 --> 01:24:09.643
                      BY WHO?

01:24:09.645 --> 01:24:11.545
       I DON'T KNOW.
       THE WATCH COMMANDER

01:24:11.547 --> 01:24:13.080
       WANTED ME
       TO RELEASE YOU.

01:24:18.353 --> 01:24:20.521
                WHAT'S GOING ON?
                WHO GOT ME OUT?

01:24:20.523 --> 01:24:22.456
      LEE. REMEMBER
      THE LITTLE PUNK

01:24:22.458 --> 01:24:24.224
    THAT USED TO GIVE YOU
    A HARD TIME?

01:24:24.226 --> 01:24:26.326
    HE CAME IN FOR A PIZZA
    AND ASKED ABOUT YOU.

01:24:26.328 --> 01:24:27.728
       I TOLD HIM
       WHAT HAPPENED.

01:24:27.730 --> 01:24:29.663
  HE SEEMED UPSET, SAID
  HE WAS GOING TO TALK

01:24:29.665 --> 01:24:31.331
     TO HIS OLD MAN,
     THE D.A.

01:24:31.333 --> 01:24:33.100
     HE GOT YOU OUT.

01:24:33.102 --> 01:24:34.768
 ALL RIGHT? LET'S GO!

01:24:34.770 --> 01:24:36.170
                    YEAH.

01:24:36.172 --> 01:24:37.504
I'LL BE OUT IN THE CAR.

01:24:37.506 --> 01:24:39.606
                    OKAY.

01:25:01.162 --> 01:25:03.197
                   HI THERE.

               I'M TRULY SORRY.

01:25:12.241 --> 01:25:13.874
               I'M SORRY
               FOR EVERYTHING.

01:25:13.876 --> 01:25:15.876
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
SAY ANYTHING.

01:25:19.781 --> 01:25:22.783
               I HAD NO RIGHT...

01:25:22.785 --> 01:25:26.220
          TO TELL YOU TO STOP
          GOING OUT WITH ROLAND.

01:25:28.523 --> 01:25:30.157
    YEAH.

01:25:33.294 --> 01:25:35.329

01:25:49.544 --> 01:25:51.578
          I'M GOING TO GO TO
          THE MEETINGS WITH HIM.

01:25:51.580 --> 01:25:54.181
 THAT'S GOOD.

01:25:54.183 --> 01:25:56.350
               YEAH.

01:25:59.654 --> 01:26:05.659
YOU KNOW, I'M GIVING HIM
ANOTHER CHANCE.

01:26:05.661 --> 01:26:08.195
        I CAN LEAVE IF YOU WANT.

01:26:08.197 --> 01:26:10.697

            OH, I'LL STAY
            WITH ROLAND.

01:26:14.837 --> 01:26:18.539
          I CAN STAY WITH HIM.

01:26:18.541 --> 01:26:21.508
HE ASKED ME TO MARRY HIM.

01:26:24.412 --> 01:26:25.712
            THAT'S GREAT.

01:26:25.714 --> 01:26:27.714
     YEAH.

01:26:27.716 --> 01:26:31.318
           DID YOU SAY YES?

01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:33.187
YEAH, I DIDN'T HAVE
AN ANSWER.

01:26:33.189 --> 01:26:36.657
IT'S SO SOON, YOU KNOW,
AND THIS WAS BEFORE--

01:26:36.659 --> 01:26:38.192
     JIMMY.

01:26:38.194 --> 01:26:39.793
          WELL, HE'LL BE LUCKY
          TO HAVE YOU.

01:26:39.795 --> 01:26:42.930
OKAY, WHAT'S WITH YOU?

01:26:42.932 --> 01:26:46.867
 WHY THE SUDDEN
 CHANGE OF HEART?

01:26:48.637 --> 01:26:51.572
           IF I TOLD YOU, YOU
           WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT.

01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:01.582
I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN DO THIS.

01:27:04.252 --> 01:27:05.452
                DO WHAT?

01:27:05.454 --> 01:27:06.853
I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN LIVE--

01:27:06.855 --> 01:27:09.590
I DON'T KNOW, VI.
IT JUST...

01:27:09.592 --> 01:27:11.592
YOU KNOW, JUST...

01:27:11.594 --> 01:27:13.827
 IT JUST KILLS ME,
 YOU KNOW?

01:27:13.829 --> 01:27:15.762
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO DO. I DON'T KNOW

01:27:15.764 --> 01:27:18.332
HOW TO KEEP GOING,
YOU KNOW?

01:27:20.735 --> 01:27:22.269
LIKE ROLAND,
HE DRIVES YOU OUT,

01:27:22.271 --> 01:27:23.804
BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

01:27:23.806 --> 01:27:26.807
I CAN'T TAKE THE PAIN.

01:27:26.809 --> 01:27:30.244
FEELS LIKE MY SKIN IS BEING
RIPPED OFF MY BODY.

01:27:30.246 --> 01:27:32.312
            HEY, COME HERE.

01:27:32.314 --> 01:27:33.847
             I LOVE YOU,

01:27:33.849 --> 01:27:36.483
            AND I WILL DO
            ANYTHING FOR YOU.

01:27:39.988 --> 01:27:41.989
     THANK YOU.

01:27:55.837 --> 01:27:57.471
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO YOU,

01:27:57.473 --> 01:27:59.339
BUT I KNOW IT'S GOOD.

01:28:02.644 --> 01:28:06.913
THAT MAY BE THE ONLY LIGHT
I HAVE RIGHT NOW.

01:28:21.029 --> 01:28:22.763
                  THE ROCK.

01:28:22.765 --> 01:28:25.465
HE PUT SOMETHING SPECIAL
UNDER THE ROCK HERE.

01:28:27.069 --> 01:28:29.903
          WHAT'S UNDER THE ROCK?

01:28:29.905 --> 01:28:32.406
THE ROCK, IT'S RIGHT THERE
FOR YOU AND MY MOM.

01:28:48.890 --> 01:28:50.957
                THIS IS BULL!

01:28:55.797 --> 01:28:58.098
              ONE MORE TRY.

01:29:30.932 --> 01:29:33.367
                 WOW.

01:29:48.416 --> 01:29:50.384
NOW, WILL YOU PLEASE
TAKE THE MONEY?

01:29:50.386 --> 01:29:52.853
               NO, I DON'T WANT
               YOUR BLOOD MONEY.

01:29:52.855 --> 01:29:55.622
   JIMMY LEFT IT
   FOR YOU!

01:29:55.624 --> 01:29:59.025
             VIAN, TELL ME WHERE
             YOU GOT THE MONEY.

01:29:59.027 --> 01:30:02.429
  I TOLD YOU.
  JIMMY CAME TO ME,

01:30:02.431 --> 01:30:05.065
  LIKE, IN A DREAM
  BUT MORE REAL.

01:30:05.067 --> 01:30:08.635
 HE SAID OUR FATHER,
 SHERM,

01:30:08.637 --> 01:30:10.904
SHERM LEFT IT FOR HIM.

01:30:10.906 --> 01:30:12.939
YOU KNOW DAD,
HE NEVER TRUSTED BANKS.

01:30:12.941 --> 01:30:15.142
             I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
             GOING ON WITH YOU,

01:30:15.144 --> 01:30:16.910
             BUT I DON'T WANT
             YOUR MONEY.

01:30:16.912 --> 01:30:19.579
IT'S OUR MONEY.
IT WAS JIMMY'S MONEY,

01:30:19.581 --> 01:30:21.715
AND JIMMY LEFT IT FOR US.

01:30:21.717 --> 01:30:23.150
               I DON'T BELIEVE
               THAT STORY,

01:30:23.152 --> 01:30:25.152
               AND YOU SHOULD BE
               DISGUSTED

01:30:25.154 --> 01:30:28.121
           THAT YOU MADE THAT UP
           ABOUT JIMMY.

01:30:28.123 --> 01:30:30.657
I'M SORRY, BUT IT'S TRUE.

01:30:30.659 --> 01:30:32.592
NOW, WILL YOU PLEASE
TAKE THE MONEY?

01:30:32.594 --> 01:30:34.027
               NO, I WON'T,
               AND I DON'T WANT

01:30:34.029 --> 01:30:35.429
               TO TALK ABOUT IT
               ANYMORE.

01:30:48.009 --> 01:30:49.810
                SO, WHAT'S
                SO IMPORTANT,

01:30:49.812 --> 01:30:51.711
            YOU COULDN'T TELL ME
            OVER THE PHONE?

01:30:53.214 --> 01:30:56.016
I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE
FOR COMING OVER HERE DRUNK.

01:30:56.018 --> 01:30:59.186
IT WAS DISRESPECTFUL,
AND I'M SORRY.

01:31:00.922 --> 01:31:03.557
                   GREAT.

01:31:03.559 --> 01:31:06.059
                 IS THAT IT?

01:31:06.061 --> 01:31:08.228
     YEAH.

01:31:08.230 --> 01:31:10.464
  I MEAN...

01:31:10.466 --> 01:31:13.934
I REALLY LIKE YOU,
AND...

01:31:13.936 --> 01:31:17.604
I JUST WANTED TO
TELL YOU THIS IN PERSON.

01:31:17.606 --> 01:31:19.706
              I REALLY LIKE YOU,
              TOO, VIAN.

01:31:22.510 --> 01:31:25.745
         I JUST DON'T THINK
         WE SHOULD DATE ANYMORE.

01:31:27.548 --> 01:31:29.015
               I THINK WE'RE
               REALLY DIFFERENT,

01:31:29.017 --> 01:31:31.985
              AND I DON'T SEE
              HOW IT WOULD WORK.

01:31:36.624 --> 01:31:39.125
       OH.

01:31:39.127 --> 01:31:41.928
      OKAY.

01:31:41.930 --> 01:31:46.099
WELL, THANKS FOR
SEEING ME IN PERSON.

01:31:47.502 --> 01:31:49.069
               YEAH, OF COURSE.

01:32:01.083 --> 01:32:02.282
<i> HI.</i>

01:32:02.284 --> 01:32:03.884
             WE'RE NOT OPEN YET.

01:32:06.988 --> 01:32:08.755
THIS PLACE STILL FOR SALE?

01:32:10.191 --> 01:32:12.659
                 I FIRED YOU.

01:32:14.028 --> 01:32:17.998
I KNOW, AND I DESERVED
TO BE FIRED. I--

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.700
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE
FOR BEING A CREEP

01:32:20.702 --> 01:32:23.904
ABOUT YOU AND MY SISTER.

01:32:23.906 --> 01:32:27.207
IT'S JUST I REALLY LOVE HER,
AND I THINK SHE LOVES YOU,

01:32:27.209 --> 01:32:30.243
AND I THINK IF SHE HAS YOU
GOING TO CHURCH, WELL--

01:32:30.245 --> 01:32:32.245
       WHAT'S WRONG WITH CHURCH?

01:32:32.247 --> 01:32:35.048
WELL, NOTHING. NOTH--
NOTHING'S WRONG WITH CHURCH.

01:32:35.050 --> 01:32:38.051
         THEY GAVE OUT FREE
         SNOW CONES LAST SUNDAY.

01:32:38.053 --> 01:32:40.220
    OH.

01:32:41.722 --> 01:32:44.090
I WANT TO GO TO
A.A. MEETINGS WITH YOU.

01:32:44.092 --> 01:32:46.593
                   GOOD.

01:32:46.595 --> 01:32:48.595
              WE'VE BEEN SAVING
              A SEAT FOR YOU.

01:32:54.001 --> 01:32:55.835
HERE'S MY 15,000.

01:32:58.172 --> 01:33:01.041
  WE'RE PARTNERS.

01:33:03.110 --> 01:33:05.111

                          <i> YEAH.</i>

     HEY!

01:33:34.909 --> 01:33:36.376
     HOW WAS CHURCH?

01:33:36.378 --> 01:33:38.311
                   IT WAS GREAT.

01:33:38.313 --> 01:33:41.181
          I PRAYED IN CHURCH
          ABOUT YOUR STORY,

01:33:41.183 --> 01:33:45.719
       ABOUT JIMMY IN THE DREAM.
       I BELIEVE YOU.
