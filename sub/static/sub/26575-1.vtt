00:20.080 --> 00:22.200
This is Western DMG.

00:30.400 --> 00:31.960
Excuse me. Miss...

00:38.760 --> 00:43.120
On the morning of November the 29th,
Wesley Ndoyo departed

00:43.240 --> 00:46.720
West India Quay Station,
through the Eldon Street exit.

00:54.960 --> 01:01.080
At 10:30am, Mr Ndoyo entered
the Eldon Street branch of Cafe 66.

01:08.760 --> 01:10.200
Here you go.

01:10.320 --> 01:12.320
Oh, thank you so much.

01:12.440 --> 01:13.840
- Where did I leave it?
- On the DLR.

01:13.960 --> 01:17.240
You're lucky I grabbed it.
It would have ended up in Shadwell.

01:17.360 --> 01:19.400
Wait, you got off the train for me?

01:19.520 --> 01:20.440
I guess so, yeah.

01:20.560 --> 01:22.480
That's amazing.
Let me give you something.

01:22.600 --> 01:24.720
What? Nah, man. No, seriously.

01:24.840 --> 01:26.080
I've only got the debit anyway.

01:26.200 --> 01:28.480
Don't worry about it, yeah?
We've all been there.

01:28.600 --> 01:30.120
I really hope not.

01:30.240 --> 01:32.640
- Are you all right?
- Yes. Um...

01:32.760 --> 01:34.080
Sorry.

01:34.200 --> 01:37.320
Let me buy you a coffee or a tea,
maybe, anything?

01:37.440 --> 01:39.720
- Please.
- All right, you twisted my arm.

01:39.840 --> 01:42.560
- I'll have a coffee.
- Double shot for me today, I think.

01:42.680 --> 01:45.280
I'm Emily.
Sorry, I didn't get your name.

01:45.400 --> 01:46.640
GUNSHOT, GLASS BREAKING

01:46.760 --> 01:48.680
SCREAMING, MORE GUNSHOTS

01:50.200 --> 01:51.680
MAN SHOUTS

01:54.280 --> 01:55.640
Mate, just put that down.

01:55.760 --> 01:57.000
GUNSHOT

01:58.960 --> 02:00.320
Oh, my God!

02:03.080 --> 02:05.520
At 10:32am,

02:05.640 --> 02:08.520
Mr Ndoyo was shot by the assailant

02:08.639 --> 02:10.720
in the Eldon Street branch
of Cafe 66.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.880
Mr Ndoyo was pronounced
dead at the scene.

02:23.160 --> 02:25.600
You were at your office
when you were first made aware

02:25.720 --> 02:28.000
of the attack, is that correct?

02:28.120 --> 02:29.280
That's correct.

02:29.400 --> 02:32.040
What did you know
at that moment in time?

02:32.160 --> 02:35.400
Only what was reported
by the first responders.

02:35.520 --> 02:38.600
Shots fired, multiple casualties.

02:38.720 --> 02:40.640
The suspect was down.

02:40.760 --> 02:42.200
By down, you mean deceased?

02:42.320 --> 02:44.400
I mean incapacitated.

02:44.520 --> 02:45.960
He wasn't dead yet.

02:46.080 --> 02:50.160
Witness K, was the perpetrator known
to you at this time?

02:54.000 --> 02:56.720
I can't discuss that in an
open forum.

02:58.760 --> 03:00.360
BEEP

03:00.480 --> 03:04.320
Was the perpetrator known
to you at this time?

03:06.160 --> 03:08.440
Yes, he was.

03:08.560 --> 03:11.600
In what capacity was he
known to you?

03:24.680 --> 03:28.440
_

03:57.280 --> 03:59.720
So, Raza, who are you, then?

04:00.720 --> 04:02.760
Kind of a heavy question, bruv.

04:02.880 --> 04:05.160
- Feels like I'm on X Factor, innit?
- OTHER PEOPLE CHUCKLE

04:05.280 --> 04:10.200
Um, I guess I'd say, "I go out,
chill out, hang out."

04:10.320 --> 04:11.680
But I'm clean. I pay my rent.

04:11.800 --> 04:16.600
I'm not too loud but I'm not sitting
in the corner like a weirdo neither.

04:16.720 --> 04:20.200
No, for real, I think
I'd make a legit flatmate.

04:20.320 --> 04:21.880
Cool. We're all in the arts.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.680
We use the studio to collaborate.

04:23.800 --> 04:25.440
Yeah, do you do anything creative?

04:25.560 --> 04:26.640
Who's the photographer?

04:26.760 --> 04:28.920
- This one.
- You mind?

04:29.040 --> 04:31.520
No, go for it.
Are you into photography?

04:31.640 --> 04:33.600
I like what Robert Capa said,
you know?

04:33.720 --> 04:36.240
"Pictures are already there,
you just have to take them."

04:36.360 --> 04:39.160
- Very good.
- You took all these?

04:39.280 --> 04:40.280
Sound.

04:40.400 --> 04:43.680
Yeah, I do mainly street
photography.

04:43.800 --> 04:46.640
That's over by Altab Ali, isn't it?

04:46.760 --> 04:48.200
I used to run round there as a kid.

04:48.320 --> 04:51.160
Of course, you wouldn't want
to live here back then.

04:51.280 --> 04:53.320
We're a lot different.

04:53.440 --> 04:57.000
Yeah, I use my lens to highlight
shifting urban environments.

04:57.120 --> 04:59.240
Hold up.
That's my street.

04:59.360 --> 05:02.560
- What?!
- No way, bruv!

05:02.680 --> 05:05.200
No way. I'm in this one.

05:05.320 --> 05:07.400
- Where?
- No word of a lie, that is me.

05:07.520 --> 05:09.080
- Shut up.
- Really?

05:09.200 --> 05:11.800
- That is actually me.
- No way.

05:11.920 --> 05:14.520
That is so random.
I took that like two years ago.

05:15.760 --> 05:17.680
Young Radicals.

05:17.800 --> 05:18.960
What's that?

05:19.920 --> 05:24.760
Oh, it's the title of the piece -
it's just a play on words.

05:24.880 --> 05:27.840
That dude there's a tramp,
no-one's really listening to him

05:27.960 --> 05:29.920
and there's me having a fag break.

05:30.040 --> 05:31.800
What's radical about that?

05:31.920 --> 05:34.680
No, it's more like the guy
in the background handing

05:34.800 --> 05:36.120
out the flyers.

05:36.240 --> 05:37.560
Oh, OK.

05:38.880 --> 05:42.240
That's Tarik.
He works over at Aladdin's Garden.

05:42.360 --> 05:44.160
Those are menus, bruv.

05:46.800 --> 05:48.480
It's been in galleries?

05:49.560 --> 05:53.880
Er, yeah, I, um...
I had a show last year.

05:55.080 --> 05:56.520
Cool, cool.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.680
Well, keep me posted, yeah?

06:00.800 --> 06:02.760
- Yeah, of course.
- Sure, will do.

06:36.280 --> 06:39.080
- Salam, Aunties.
- Hi, Faza.

06:39.200 --> 06:40.760
Don't fret.
I can't see nothing.

06:40.880 --> 06:42.080
You look lovely, though.

06:44.040 --> 06:46.720
What are you doing in bloody
Shoreditch looking for flats?

06:46.840 --> 06:50.440
Don't... Don't think I don't
have eyes everywhere.

06:50.560 --> 06:52.360
You don't have eyes
at the school, Ummi.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.320
Nasir texted me - detention again.

06:54.440 --> 06:56.880
What?
Well, you'll have to go fetch him.

06:58.480 --> 06:59.960
Drug money.

07:00.080 --> 07:01.600
Please don't joke like that.

07:01.720 --> 07:03.960
Remember Anara's boy, he walked
all the way to Ipswich,

07:04.080 --> 07:05.360
thinking he was Jesus.

07:05.480 --> 07:08.160
Of course, he had to be high
to go to Ipswich.

07:08.280 --> 07:10.200
So, how was it, this flat?

07:10.320 --> 07:13.320
500 quid for a room
in an old handbag factory.

07:17.040 --> 07:18.680
He's not going anywhere.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.680
Miss Woods?

07:28.800 --> 07:29.960
I'm Raza Shar.

07:30.080 --> 07:31.960
Yes, yes, Nasir's brother.

07:33.400 --> 07:34.760
Ah.

07:34.880 --> 07:36.560
I was really expecting your mum.

07:36.680 --> 07:38.560
She's stuck at work, Miss Woods.

07:38.680 --> 07:39.640
What's he done?

07:39.760 --> 07:41.400
Uh...

07:41.520 --> 07:44.520
Nasir is one of my brightest pupils

07:44.640 --> 07:48.440
but I can't have this
in my class, you understand?

07:50.440 --> 07:53.120
I'm going to have to suspend him.

07:54.240 --> 07:56.160
_

07:57.040 --> 07:59.520
_

08:00.320 --> 08:02.800
_

08:02.920 --> 08:04.760
_

08:04.880 --> 08:06.280
_

08:06.400 --> 08:08.720
Hold on.
What were you telling him?

08:08.840 --> 08:11.000
My father will deal with him.

08:11.120 --> 08:14.560
Nasir won't shame us
like this again.

08:14.680 --> 08:16.400
It's not the end of the world.

08:16.520 --> 08:19.840
They shouldn't really
be selling these things,

08:19.960 --> 08:21.240
let alone to kids.

08:21.360 --> 08:23.360
There's no need to overreact.

08:23.480 --> 08:24.520
RAZA AND NASIR LAUGHING

08:24.640 --> 08:25.520
What, you OG now?

08:25.640 --> 08:27.080
Taking knives into school and that.

08:27.200 --> 08:29.560
It's protection, isn't it?

08:29.680 --> 08:31.040
Someone's messing with you?

08:31.160 --> 08:34.159
No, Mr Roy gave me an A in maths,
so I've got to even out

08:34.280 --> 08:35.960
my street cred.

08:36.080 --> 08:38.960
You're going to be an astronaut.
What do you need street cred for?

08:39.080 --> 08:40.360
They barely let Pakis on planes,

08:40.480 --> 08:42.280
how are they going to let me
up into space?

08:43.440 --> 08:46.880
Spaceman, Samurai,
multitudes, innit?

08:47.000 --> 08:50.280
Presto, now, you're a photographer.

08:50.400 --> 08:51.880
This is old.
It's got no screen.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.920
- So, you don't want it, then?
- Nah, nah, I do, I do.

08:54.040 --> 08:56.760
Don't...
Show me how it works.

08:56.880 --> 08:59.960
All right. Wind, click.

09:00.080 --> 09:01.160
Google it.

09:02.880 --> 09:05.000
Yo, turn around.

09:15.200 --> 09:16.200
Quick, get upstairs.

09:16.320 --> 09:18.920
What's going on in the world, Abu?

09:19.040 --> 09:20.560
Still spinning, barely.

09:23.880 --> 09:25.120
Where's the shorter one?

09:25.240 --> 09:27.000
Hiding in his room.

09:27.120 --> 09:28.040
Bloody pocket knife!

09:28.160 --> 09:30.960
It's a dangerous world out there.

09:31.840 --> 09:33.160
Smells good, Ummi.

09:34.200 --> 09:35.720
Get out. Go.

09:35.840 --> 09:37.680
Nothing to see here, huh?

09:37.800 --> 09:38.960
SHE CHUCKLES

10:08.120 --> 10:10.880
- PHONE RINGS
- Gotcha.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.360
Yo.

10:12.480 --> 10:14.120
Hello, hello.

10:14.240 --> 10:16.560
I knew I could smell you up there.

10:16.680 --> 10:18.400
That's what you've got
a big nose for.

10:18.520 --> 10:20.800
Come down.
Let's see if you can fly.

10:20.920 --> 10:23.840
All right. Coming right down.

10:23.960 --> 10:25.040
Heads up, yeah?

10:25.960 --> 10:28.360
Where are you off
to dressed like that?

10:28.480 --> 10:31.040
- Too much?
- Nah, you look well sharp.

10:32.680 --> 10:34.680
That's a lot of Kush, big spender.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.040
Nah, bruv. I want them rolls.

10:37.160 --> 10:38.800
Big night out, then, who is she?

10:38.920 --> 10:40.760
How many's that fetch me?

10:40.880 --> 10:42.520
Ten, but I'm going
to give you seven.

10:42.640 --> 10:43.720
Any more is intent.

10:43.840 --> 10:46.920
Feds don't mess around
with that Class A shit.

10:47.040 --> 10:48.320
There you go, killer.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.200
No sleep till Brooklyn.

10:53.800 --> 10:57.200
..from Syria, under the
leadership of Ahmed El Adoua,

10:57.320 --> 10:59.880
- known to have been behind...
- What have you got chopsticks for?

11:00.000 --> 11:01.680
Ummi thinks she's a
comedian or something.

11:01.800 --> 11:04.160
He can't be trusted
with sharp objects, can he?

11:04.280 --> 11:05.840
- You not eating?
- Nah.

11:05.960 --> 11:08.600
..Rotterdam yesterday. Dutch
authorities have confirmed...

11:08.720 --> 11:10.040
Hey. Careful tonight, yeah?

11:10.160 --> 11:14.800
Anyone picks on you, don't be brave,
tell them you're a Hindu.

11:14.920 --> 11:17.720
Don't freak, I'm a Sikh.

11:17.840 --> 11:18.720
That's my boy.

11:18.840 --> 11:20.760
..have launched a manhunt for
the perpetrators.

11:20.880 --> 11:22.280
Ahmed El Adoua is...

11:46.080 --> 11:47.120
Charlotte...

11:48.240 --> 11:50.280
Raza.
Sorry the signal's crap.

11:50.400 --> 11:51.480
I just got your texts.

11:51.600 --> 11:52.760
Good, found you.

11:54.720 --> 11:56.160
Who you all dressed up for?

11:56.280 --> 11:58.200
I roll out of bed like this, innit?

11:58.320 --> 12:01.040
Tristan, Angel, this is Raza.

12:02.920 --> 12:04.640
With your birthday cake.

12:04.760 --> 12:05.880
Oh, my birthday cake!

12:06.000 --> 12:07.320
Fucking brilliant.

12:07.440 --> 12:09.800
- How goes it, Raza?
- Are you good, mate?

12:09.920 --> 12:11.000
You want to...?

12:13.720 --> 12:15.800
Happy birthday, innit.

12:15.920 --> 12:17.360
Our usual bloke's in Ibiza.

12:17.480 --> 12:19.440
Rakes it in this time of year.

12:19.560 --> 12:21.080
This ain't cut like the shit
he gets you.

12:21.200 --> 12:23.240
Lottie, where did you meet
this rascal?

12:23.360 --> 12:25.440
Well, swiped right, didn't she?

12:25.560 --> 12:27.520
- Raza!
- You little piggy.

13:02.320 --> 13:04.200
- You won't say anything, Raza?
- Easy, easy.

13:04.320 --> 13:05.840
- Oi, oi.
- Are you getting in or what?

13:05.960 --> 13:09.360
- I'm not driving anyone like that.
- Just take us to the nearest hospital.

13:09.480 --> 13:10.560
Keep the change.

13:10.680 --> 13:12.520
In here, in the back.

13:12.640 --> 13:13.960
- You're joking.
- Just paid up, mate.

13:14.080 --> 13:16.400
Go. You got your money, go.

13:16.520 --> 13:19.280
You're gonna be OK.
All right, all right, all right.

13:20.920 --> 13:22.280
Just grab her legs.

13:22.400 --> 13:23.520
SHE MOANS

13:25.920 --> 13:27.400
Help.

13:27.520 --> 13:30.000
Can I get some help, please?

13:30.120 --> 13:32.560
- Can you tell me your name, love?
- Charlotte. Charlotte Humphreys.

13:32.680 --> 13:34.960
- Tell me what she took?
- MDMA, just the one.

13:35.080 --> 13:37.320
- How long ago was that?
- Three hours, at the most.

13:37.440 --> 13:38.800
Do you have a number I can contact?

13:38.920 --> 13:41.560
She's got a mobile. It's probably in
her purse. Is she going to be OK?

13:41.680 --> 13:43.640
- Can't go back there, sir.
- Is she going to be OK?

13:43.760 --> 13:46.120
I need you to step aside, please.
That's for the doctors now.

13:46.240 --> 13:48.080
- Put your hands against the wall.
- What am I doing?

13:48.200 --> 13:49.800
Sir, put your hands against the
wall.

13:49.920 --> 13:52.120
Do have any weapons or sharp
objects in your pockets?

13:57.360 --> 13:59.640
Is this what you gave
the young lady?

13:59.760 --> 14:01.880
I'm arresting you on possession
of a Class A drug.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.520
You do not have to say anything...

14:03.640 --> 14:09.680
# Wise men say...

14:11.680 --> 14:18.040
# Only fools rush in

14:21.800 --> 14:28.240
# But I can't help

14:29.440 --> 14:34.320
# Falling in love

14:34.440 --> 14:37.720
# With you

14:41.560 --> 14:47.320
# Take my hand

14:50.040 --> 14:57.440
# Take my whole life too

15:00.440 --> 15:06.480
# And I can't help

15:07.960 --> 15:12.360
# Falling in love

15:12.480 --> 15:15.360
♪ With you. ♪

15:52.560 --> 15:54.520
HUBBUB

15:54.640 --> 15:56.280
Look sharp, here she comes.

16:14.440 --> 16:17.280
Welcome to CTSU, Miss Morton.

16:17.400 --> 16:20.040
Would you like
to introduce yourself?

16:20.880 --> 16:21.920
Holly.

16:24.800 --> 16:26.680
Apparently not much of a charmer.

16:26.800 --> 16:29.960
I'll leave you
to make your own assessments.

16:30.080 --> 16:32.360
Gabriel, Holly will ride with you.

16:32.480 --> 16:33.640
Yes, guv.

16:33.760 --> 16:36.800
Now, you will have heard
about the untimely death of El Adoua

16:36.920 --> 16:39.200
in a drone strike last night.

16:39.320 --> 16:42.640
The Dutch confirmed he recruited the
Rotterdam bombers late last year.

16:42.760 --> 16:45.680
But, before conspiring to deliver
the caliphate to Holland,

16:45.800 --> 16:49.400
Mr El Adoua might have brought
a piece of it here.

16:49.520 --> 16:50.520
Shall we?

16:50.640 --> 16:54.200
AIVD, or whatever the Dutch are calling
themselves these days, found El A...

16:55.720 --> 16:57.600
Is it "Eladoua" or "El Ad-ou-a"?

16:57.720 --> 16:59.080
El Adoua.

16:59.200 --> 17:02.320
Either way, AIVD found
his travel documents.

17:02.440 --> 17:03.840
One of the passports got a hit,

17:03.960 --> 17:05.920
flight to London Stansted
on June 11th.

17:06.040 --> 17:10.599
CCTV trawls from Stansted that day
show El Adoua disembarking.

17:10.720 --> 17:13.200
Until they have something to share,
that's as much as the gods

17:13.319 --> 17:14.680
have given us.

17:14.800 --> 17:17.040
We paint the rest of
the picture ourselves.

17:17.160 --> 17:19.920
Prior to his death,
he was in London.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.839
Where did he stay? With whom?

17:23.920 --> 17:28.359
And why in Christ was
Mr El Adoua in my lovely city?

17:28.480 --> 17:29.720
Yes, guv.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.280
- Yes, guv.
- PHONE ALERT

17:34.360 --> 17:38.120
Number Three says five to
at the Croxford Street Cafe.

17:38.240 --> 17:40.240
No, tell him Nunhead Road.

17:40.360 --> 17:43.800
And text him at five to and tell him
Hardess Street at quarter past.

17:43.920 --> 17:45.800
We set the agenda, always.

17:47.560 --> 17:49.840
You haven't worked informants
before, have you?

17:49.960 --> 17:51.240
Not personally.

17:51.360 --> 17:53.680
Well, there's no other way to do it,
other than personally.

17:53.800 --> 17:56.880
Obviously, I understand building
relationships is crucial

17:57.000 --> 18:01.040
to gathering intelligence
and preventing terror attacks.

18:02.920 --> 18:04.880
You like to win, don't you?

18:06.280 --> 18:07.600
Who wants to lose?

18:08.600 --> 18:10.960
Well, let me spare you the grief.

18:11.080 --> 18:12.720
We'll fail.

18:12.840 --> 18:15.320
And when we do, people die.

18:15.440 --> 18:18.280
Someone always slips
through the net.

18:18.400 --> 18:21.240
Yeah.
Stand there, please, mate.

18:22.440 --> 18:23.680
Turn to your right.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.680
Look at the blue dot on the wall.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.240
CAMERA CLICKS

18:32.800 --> 18:35.640
Excuse me, sir. Could you step to
the desk, please? Thank you.

18:41.360 --> 18:44.520
PHONE RINGING

18:44.640 --> 18:47.960
You have reached the voicemail
box of Hanif Shar.

18:48.080 --> 18:49.880
Stop messing with me, not now.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.400
Raza, love, you've got
to lighten up.

18:52.520 --> 18:53.840
I got arrested, Abu.

18:55.040 --> 18:56.600
- Ah, you broke your cherry.
- Yeah, Listen,

18:56.720 --> 18:58.720
I need you to open up the salon, OK?

18:58.840 --> 19:01.080
I can't. I'll be coming down there,
read them your rights.

19:01.200 --> 19:03.560
No, I don't need that.
I need you to open up the salon.

19:03.680 --> 19:05.360
- BEEPING
- Hang on, bloody battery.

19:06.480 --> 19:09.480
- Hello.
- Abu? Abu?

19:09.600 --> 19:11.280
DIAL TONE

19:11.400 --> 19:12.680
Of course you've not charged...

19:12.800 --> 19:14.600
Of course you've not charged
your phone.

19:16.200 --> 19:17.680
Just be on the lookout for
new snouts

19:17.800 --> 19:19.440
and don't bother with the mosques.

19:19.560 --> 19:22.680
All my best assets are
on the Devil's wishlist already.

19:22.800 --> 19:26.240
Junkies, dealers, perverts,
any one you can get leverage on.

19:26.360 --> 19:28.640
They'll grass on their mates
and their families.

19:28.760 --> 19:31.800
They'll just as easily turn on you.
They're not your friends.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.040
You squeeze them, rinse them.

19:33.160 --> 19:35.880
If they give you any trouble,
you drop them, move on.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.720
This guy here, El Adoua.

19:39.840 --> 19:42.400
Yeah, I think I saw this guy come
in my shop this morning.

19:42.520 --> 19:43.640
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:43.760 --> 19:47.240
Cos he spent most of yesterday
in a bomb crater in Syria.

19:47.360 --> 19:49.520
Well, maybe I'll have
an improved memory

19:49.640 --> 19:54.240
if you catch the wanker that keeps
graffitiing my windows.

19:54.360 --> 19:55.880
Never seen this shithead.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.360
I'd have lamped him if I had.

19:57.480 --> 20:00.120
Ah, there's this one bloke though,
come up to me.

20:00.240 --> 20:01.640
Bigging up Al-Qaeda and them.

20:01.760 --> 20:02.840
Who's this?

20:02.960 --> 20:07.360
I don't know.
Like, long hair and a beard.

20:07.480 --> 20:09.280
Mm-hm.

20:09.400 --> 20:11.200
Looks like a Bangla Hagrid.

20:11.320 --> 20:12.920
You're drawing attention
to yourself.

20:13.040 --> 20:15.080
Stop trying to instigate
jihad in the mosques.

20:15.200 --> 20:17.880
- I get another complaint, I'll arrest you.
- I'm trying my best.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.800
How else do I get these
people exposed?

20:25.840 --> 20:28.120
MAN RETCHING

20:40.840 --> 20:42.320
What?

20:48.800 --> 20:51.040
Looks like he can afford it,
though, innit?

20:57.520 --> 20:59.120
Other wrap must have bust in
my belly.

20:59.240 --> 21:01.080
I'm cheesing my tits off.

21:01.200 --> 21:04.280
Yeah, I'm regretting that Mandy
right about now.

21:05.680 --> 21:07.120
Don't matter, though.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.080
Only the guilty sleep in rusty.

21:11.200 --> 21:15.040
That's from that movie, Kaiser Sose.

21:15.160 --> 21:16.640
What about you?

21:18.880 --> 21:23.000
We all got a
little haram in us, bro.

21:23.120 --> 21:24.800
Dadir.

21:26.040 --> 21:28.200
Raza.

21:28.320 --> 21:29.680
Raza the Rizla.

21:29.800 --> 21:31.640
I'ma burn you up.

21:34.320 --> 21:36.160
What's your postcode, brother?

21:55.560 --> 21:57.120
What's that?
What are you writing?

21:57.240 --> 22:00.640
2123, source meeting, Bow Canal.

22:00.760 --> 22:02.720
Hey, do me a favour.
Leave this one out.

22:02.840 --> 22:04.760
Yousef's a bit skittish.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.720
Maybe hang back here, yeah.

22:23.080 --> 22:25.760
What on earth is
she doing out there?

22:27.160 --> 22:28.920
It's her first day.

22:29.040 --> 22:30.480
I didn't know Feds
come in that size.

22:30.600 --> 22:33.120
Is she going to make it to day two?

22:33.240 --> 22:35.680
One of the Rotterdam bombers
was spotted in London.

22:35.800 --> 22:37.440
El Adoua, you heard of him?

22:37.560 --> 22:39.600
Yeah, I've got a telly, yeah.

22:43.200 --> 22:45.360
Look, there's got to be a bit
of give and take today.

22:45.480 --> 22:48.160
Feds have got my brother
on possession.

22:48.280 --> 22:50.120
You saw El Adoua in London.

22:50.240 --> 22:51.840
What about my brother?

22:51.960 --> 22:55.360
You're going to have to sell me
a little harder.

22:57.400 --> 23:01.200
I saw your man around, yeah,
back in the summer.

23:01.320 --> 23:04.600
Hanging near Bridgetown
with this bigshot dude.

23:04.720 --> 23:07.400
Word was they met in Raqqa
a whiles back.

23:07.520 --> 23:09.600
Raqqa?
Have you been holding out on me?

23:09.720 --> 23:12.840
Nah.
You're the one asked the questions.

23:12.960 --> 23:14.840
Bigshot - what's his name?

23:17.920 --> 23:18.880
Look...

23:19.000 --> 23:21.680
my brother's out, we talk.

23:25.400 --> 23:26.680
I'll see what I can do.

23:26.800 --> 23:28.400
See what you can do then, innit?

23:28.520 --> 23:32.320
Oi, don't dream of dodging me
on this one.

23:32.440 --> 23:33.880
Get Shorty an umbrella.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.240
She's going to catch the death.

23:48.600 --> 23:50.320
Yo. Yo, yo, yo, yo.

23:50.440 --> 23:51.840
Wake up. Wake up, yo.

24:17.800 --> 24:19.120
What?

24:43.480 --> 24:46.200
Right. Tadir Hassan's release
should be processed by the morning.

24:46.320 --> 24:48.840
His case officer will
have a bleeding hissy fit.

24:50.880 --> 24:53.400
CPS approved.

24:53.520 --> 24:56.520
We all have to make sacrifices
to win the war on terror, John.

24:56.640 --> 24:57.840
Lee...

24:59.400 --> 25:01.440
Tadir Hassan, evidence compromised.

25:01.560 --> 25:02.760
- OK.
- Cheers.

25:05.080 --> 25:10.040
This guy with Tadir Hassan,
did they get picked up together?

25:10.160 --> 25:13.280
That chappy is one Raza Shar.

25:13.400 --> 25:14.800
I'll take a look, please.

25:14.920 --> 25:17.880
- Thanks.
- Brought in on his own.

25:19.760 --> 25:22.440
Seems like a potential source.

25:22.560 --> 25:24.040
What gave him away?

25:24.160 --> 25:25.680
Nice tan, funny name.

25:26.760 --> 25:30.400
Young, IC4 male,
lives in council housing.

25:30.520 --> 25:33.320
At possession,
could be bumped up to intent.

25:33.440 --> 25:36.680
- That's how you want to turn him?
- First arrest. He'll want home.

25:39.120 --> 25:41.760
Have you got an interview room
for us, John?

25:41.880 --> 25:44.040
He hasn't spoken to his
defence solicitor yet.

25:44.160 --> 25:45.520
He'll get round to it.

25:48.040 --> 25:50.800
Come on, then, let's go meet
your first recruit.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.840
Raza Shar, let's have you.

25:58.800 --> 26:01.360
Raza the Rizla.

26:01.480 --> 26:03.520
Come by Bridgetown, yeah?
We'll kick it.

26:03.640 --> 26:05.040
Be easy, bruv.

26:05.160 --> 26:06.320
Come on.

26:10.720 --> 26:11.960
Come on.

26:18.200 --> 26:20.040
Nah, mate. I'm getting released.

26:20.160 --> 26:22.640
Life's full of disappointments.

26:22.760 --> 26:24.080
Have a seat, Raza.

26:32.840 --> 26:37.520
Interview commencing
at 12:24am with Raza Shar.

26:37.640 --> 26:38.800
Don't I get a lawyer?

26:38.920 --> 26:41.160
It doesn't have to come to that.

26:41.280 --> 26:44.160
If you enrol in our confidential
informant programme,

26:44.280 --> 26:46.800
we'll drop the charges and you'll
be free to go home.

26:46.920 --> 26:49.400
RAZA LAUGHS

26:49.520 --> 26:51.120
Go on, share the joke.

26:51.240 --> 26:53.720
You want me to grass -
on possession.

26:53.840 --> 26:56.040
With intent to supply?

26:56.160 --> 26:57.440
Four pills.

26:57.560 --> 26:59.800
They didn't catch me
with scales and baggies.

26:59.920 --> 27:02.360
No intent, no previous.

27:02.480 --> 27:03.480
My mate got the same rap

27:03.600 --> 27:06.040
but he walked away with
40 hours' community service.

27:06.160 --> 27:07.880
If I'm choosing between
being a snitch

27:08.000 --> 27:10.080
and working the counter
at Age Concern,

27:10.200 --> 27:12.920
yeah, bring on the grey army,
bruv.

27:14.440 --> 27:18.200
- Is that a high school blazer you're wearing?
- It was, yeah.

27:18.320 --> 27:19.960
Why did you take the badge off?

27:20.080 --> 27:22.120
Had a date, needed a jacket.

27:27.600 --> 27:30.320
Interview terminated at 12:26am.

27:38.480 --> 27:40.760
Raza Shar, you are hereby
charged with possession

27:40.880 --> 27:42.480
of a Class A substance.

27:42.600 --> 27:45.120
You've been deemed a flight risk
and will be remanded in custody

27:45.240 --> 27:47.200
- until you face the magistrates.
- Flight risk?

27:47.320 --> 27:49.400
What are you on about?

27:49.520 --> 27:50.880
I've never even left the country.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.240
You're supposed to charge me,
turn me out.

27:53.360 --> 27:54.760
Park him in Bin 5.

28:01.960 --> 28:04.120
How's he a flight risk?
They'll toss his case.

28:04.240 --> 28:06.880
There is no case, the boy will walk.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.440
I bought you 24 hours to find some
real leverage

28:09.560 --> 28:11.280
or get yourself another snout.

28:37.320 --> 28:38.400
SIREN BLARES

28:41.920 --> 28:43.440
Pigs.

28:43.560 --> 28:45.040
Yo, this is mad.

28:46.880 --> 28:48.240
Come on, Faisal, stand up.

28:48.360 --> 28:50.080
Yo, what have I even done?

28:50.200 --> 28:52.040
You going to do this again?

28:52.160 --> 28:53.840
- Keep still.
- This is profiling, man.

29:04.800 --> 29:06.080
All right?

29:06.200 --> 29:07.640
Beard's coming along.

29:07.760 --> 29:09.040
Itches like a dog's arse.

29:09.160 --> 29:12.360
You should try coconut oil.
How's that limp working out for you?

29:12.480 --> 29:15.400
It slows me down, but, you know,
all part of building out

29:15.520 --> 29:17.720
the legend, darling.

29:17.840 --> 29:19.720
Who's your friend?

29:19.840 --> 29:22.120
DC Holly Morton, first week.

29:22.240 --> 29:24.840
This is DC Imran Aziz,
the local level two.

29:24.960 --> 29:26.560
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:26.680 --> 29:29.560
One of my snouts reckons El Adoua
was seen knocking round your patch

29:29.680 --> 29:31.120
back when he was still breathing.

29:31.240 --> 29:34.360
No. No chance.

29:35.640 --> 29:39.080
I've still got to kick it
up the chain.

29:39.200 --> 29:41.080
I'll see you back at home.

29:58.080 --> 29:59.240
What's his name, then?

29:59.360 --> 30:00.960
Raza Shar.

30:01.080 --> 30:02.320
Raza Shar.

30:02.440 --> 30:03.840
Yes.

30:03.960 --> 30:04.920
And you're his father?

30:05.040 --> 30:05.960
Yes.

30:06.080 --> 30:07.480
ID, please.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.440
- Expired.
- Is it?

30:13.560 --> 30:15.440
I need valid identification.

30:15.560 --> 30:17.000
That's my face, that's my name.

30:17.120 --> 30:20.080
- It's not bloody complicated.
- Sir, you need to lower your tone.

30:20.200 --> 30:22.080
Where's my son?
Then I'll lower my bastard tone.

30:22.200 --> 30:24.480
Sir, I believe you've
had a drink or two.

30:24.600 --> 30:28.360
Take a breath, think about
what you're going to say next.

30:28.480 --> 30:30.760
OK, I say...

30:30.880 --> 30:33.280
..up yours.
Can you release my son?!

30:33.400 --> 30:35.320
- DADIR LAUGHS
- Hands off, fascist bastards.

30:35.440 --> 30:37.160
- Go on, boy.
- Police state.

30:37.280 --> 30:39.280
When are you going
to catch the real baddies?

30:46.360 --> 30:47.720
Police!

30:50.480 --> 30:53.480
- Choked on it.
- You're a dickhead, man.

30:53.600 --> 30:56.720
I told Mum
you're at the new girl's.

30:56.840 --> 30:59.040
Why you done that? You've got her
planning a wedding now.

30:59.160 --> 31:02.640
I tell her the truth,
she'll be planning the prison break.

31:02.760 --> 31:04.760
- They didn't charge you, then?
- Nah.

31:04.880 --> 31:07.480
So, I'm in there all night
and then, this morning, they said

31:07.600 --> 31:10.080
them clowns lost my gear at the lab.

31:11.920 --> 31:13.680
Can you imagine?

31:13.800 --> 31:15.480
Idiots, man.

31:15.600 --> 31:18.080
God's smiling on me today, you know?

31:18.200 --> 31:20.200
Stuff and lot.

31:20.320 --> 31:23.160
He's got better things to do
than fuck about with you, Bruv.

31:23.280 --> 31:25.240
Shut up, man, drive.

31:25.360 --> 31:26.840
I'm way too tired for your shit.

31:26.960 --> 31:28.440
PHONE RINGS

31:39.200 --> 31:42.840
MUSIC PLAYING

31:42.960 --> 31:45.000
Mr Hassan, this is the Post Office.

31:45.120 --> 31:47.880
We have a package ready for you at
the Harness Street branch.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.400
We close half an hour early today.

31:50.520 --> 31:52.000
Yousef, let's go.

31:52.120 --> 31:53.840
Yeah, yeah, in a bit.

31:55.280 --> 31:56.640
Come on, bruv. We're away.

31:56.760 --> 31:58.120
Two seconds, man.

31:59.040 --> 32:01.000
Yousef, seriously,
play it later, yeah.

32:02.440 --> 32:04.240
- MUSIC OFF
- Long, man.

32:05.560 --> 32:09.160
Yes. Jab, jab, jab.

32:12.960 --> 32:14.480
OK, wrap.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.400
You OK, yeah? You all right?

32:17.520 --> 32:19.480
LAUGHING

32:25.840 --> 32:27.320
Good work today.

32:33.240 --> 32:34.520
Yo, you headed home?

32:34.640 --> 32:35.760
Got to work.

32:35.880 --> 32:37.880
How about you drop me
off on the way?

32:38.000 --> 32:40.040
Don't want your sweat
sticking up my leather.

32:40.160 --> 32:41.880
Are you for real?

32:43.080 --> 32:45.400
You're a mug, you know that?

32:45.520 --> 32:46.600
You're a snake.

32:47.560 --> 32:49.760
You're supposed
to be my big brother. It's cold.

33:23.680 --> 33:25.520
RINGING

33:28.040 --> 33:29.880
This is Yousef.
You know what to do.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.800
- BEEP
- Hello, Yousef.

33:31.920 --> 33:33.600
Post Office again.

33:33.720 --> 33:37.960
Better collect that package soon
or we're going to toss it.

33:45.120 --> 33:47.880
You know, in all my years
on this job, I have never come

33:48.000 --> 33:51.520
across an informer lying
to get what they want.

33:51.640 --> 33:55.920
Leaving their handler pissing
in the wind is unprecedented.

34:00.880 --> 34:03.120
He was just telling you
what you want to hear.

34:03.240 --> 34:05.600
If I had £1 for every idiot
informant blathering on about Raqqa

34:05.720 --> 34:07.920
and Daesh, I could buy you all
a black flag for Christmas.

34:08.040 --> 34:11.400
He's been on my books for three
years, always been kosher.

34:11.520 --> 34:13.199
They all cash out eventually.

34:13.320 --> 34:15.280
I say we're looking at his endgame.

34:15.400 --> 34:16.480
We'll see.

34:16.600 --> 34:18.840
El Adoua was nowhere
near Bridgetown estate because,

34:18.960 --> 34:20.639
if he was, I would have seen him.

34:20.760 --> 34:24.440
If you were psychic, darling,
you'd be in my chair.

34:26.760 --> 34:27.800
Yes, guvnor.

34:33.159 --> 34:34.239
He's defensive.

34:35.280 --> 34:37.440
Because he's wrong.

34:37.560 --> 34:40.000
The SS traced El Adoua's
e-mails to an IP address

34:40.120 --> 34:43.360
of an internet cafe
on the Bridgetown estate.

34:44.719 --> 34:48.080
Imran's been under cover a while.
You know, he gets foggy.

34:48.199 --> 34:50.440
Don't like foggy, Gabriel.

34:50.560 --> 34:53.040
Yousef Hassan dropped you.

34:53.159 --> 34:54.719
We're supposed to handle
the sources,

34:54.840 --> 34:56.760
not the other way round.

34:58.080 --> 35:00.400
We need more eyes in Bridgetown.

35:15.200 --> 35:17.520
Holly, where are you at
with that kid, Raza Shar?

35:17.640 --> 35:19.720
I have found something
quite interesting.

35:19.840 --> 35:23.640
The Shar family own Delights hair
and beauty salon on Romford Street.

35:23.760 --> 35:26.040
I pulled this photo
from their website.

35:26.160 --> 35:30.000
We have the two boys - Raza, Nasir -
and that's Mum and Dad.

35:30.120 --> 35:31.240
Happy days.

35:31.360 --> 35:35.560
Except I searched the GRO and found
Miriam Shar's death certificate.

35:35.680 --> 35:39.560
Raza's mother died in...2002.

35:42.080 --> 35:43.600
So, who's the mother here then?

35:43.720 --> 35:45.360
Website says Sadia Shar,

35:45.480 --> 35:47.880
but I couldn't find
a marriage certificate,

35:48.000 --> 35:49.400
no NI number, no passport.

35:49.520 --> 35:52.080
Another intruder
to Fortress Britain.

35:52.200 --> 35:54.200
- Possibly.
- Could be leverage.

35:54.320 --> 35:55.320
I think so.

35:55.440 --> 35:57.000
Know so.

35:57.120 --> 35:59.440
I'll cross-check travel
with Border Agency.

35:59.560 --> 36:00.680
Too slow.

36:00.800 --> 36:03.520
Our boy's up in court in 16 hours.
After that, he's not our boy.

36:03.640 --> 36:05.480
I can request an extension
from the Home Office.

36:05.600 --> 36:07.240
On minor possession?

36:07.360 --> 36:09.320
Good luck with that.
They'd rather ship her home.

36:09.440 --> 36:11.560
What are we supposed to do -
interview the family?

36:11.680 --> 36:12.680
Not we.

36:12.800 --> 36:14.400
Two strangers turn
up on your doorstep,

36:14.520 --> 36:16.520
that's the police.

36:16.640 --> 36:17.920
Anyone in here police?

36:18.040 --> 36:19.720
No.

36:19.840 --> 36:20.880
Understood?

36:48.040 --> 36:49.520
Hello. Is your mum home?

36:51.280 --> 36:52.600
- Ummi?
- Yeah.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
Hello. Can I help you?

36:56.120 --> 36:59.560
Mrs Shar, I'm a counsellor from
Cornell Parkside Primary School.

36:59.680 --> 37:01.440
Oh, my boy goes to Ashton Wood.

37:01.560 --> 37:03.000
I'm here to talk about Raza.

37:03.120 --> 37:04.400
He's not here right now.

37:04.520 --> 37:06.320
OK. But you are.

37:06.440 --> 37:08.800
Would you like to invite me in?

37:13.760 --> 37:14.840
Come, this way.

37:17.520 --> 37:19.040
What is it you want?

37:19.160 --> 37:21.560
It's been years since
Raza left primary.

37:21.680 --> 37:23.480
What's left to say?

37:23.600 --> 37:25.640
Before I begin, I just
need to see some proof

37:25.760 --> 37:27.400
that you're his legal guardian.

37:27.520 --> 37:28.760
Hm?

37:28.880 --> 37:31.400
Now's really not a good time.

37:31.520 --> 37:35.360
I just need to check a passport,
driving licence - anything, really.

37:35.480 --> 37:38.600
And I'm politely asking you
to come back another time.

37:38.720 --> 37:41.920
Mrs Shar, I think
you'll want to sit down.

37:48.200 --> 37:50.040
A former teacher at our school

37:50.160 --> 37:54.640
has been accused of sexually
molesting some of his students.

37:55.920 --> 37:57.640
Raza may have been one of them.

37:57.760 --> 37:59.560
Molested?

38:01.320 --> 38:02.960
What?

38:05.160 --> 38:07.000
How?

38:07.120 --> 38:09.840
What bastard teacher did this?

38:09.960 --> 38:11.840
I can only say
he followed a pattern.

38:11.960 --> 38:16.120
Children short on friends,
foreign nationals mainly.

38:16.240 --> 38:17.840
He convinced them that
if they talked,

38:17.960 --> 38:20.080
he could have their
parents deported.

38:21.400 --> 38:24.240
Does that sound
like Raza's situation?

38:27.080 --> 38:29.400
Where were you born, Mrs Shar?

38:31.800 --> 38:33.640
Are the police looking into this?

38:33.760 --> 38:37.360
I can't go into any more details
until I see some proof

38:37.480 --> 38:39.280
that you're his mother.

38:40.640 --> 38:42.800
Mrs Shar, I'm just trying
to understand what happened

38:42.920 --> 38:44.120
to your son.

38:45.640 --> 38:46.960
So, I was born in Pakistan.

38:47.080 --> 38:48.760
What bloody difference
does that make?

38:48.880 --> 38:50.400
How did you come to be in the UK?

38:50.520 --> 38:51.880
What did this teacher do to him?

38:52.000 --> 38:57.160
If you're living here illegally,
Mrs Shar, it alters our procedure.

38:57.280 --> 38:59.560
What did...?

39:01.120 --> 39:02.920
Go and play on your computer.

39:03.040 --> 39:05.400
What's she saying about Raza,
someone's been touching him?

39:05.520 --> 39:07.080
No, no, no, nothing, nothing.

39:07.200 --> 39:08.560
Go on. Go.

39:13.080 --> 39:14.280
What is the name of this...?

39:14.400 --> 39:16.520
DOOR CLOSES

39:16.640 --> 39:17.680
Hello?

39:24.360 --> 39:25.840
Cornell Parkside Primary

39:25.960 --> 39:29.200
wants to launch a nationwide
manhunt for you.

39:29.320 --> 39:32.840
Fortunately, the mother doesn't want
to make this a police matter.

39:32.960 --> 39:36.600
Because she's undocumented -
which I was able to confirm.

39:39.400 --> 39:41.440
I was under the instructions
of a superior officer.

39:41.560 --> 39:46.640
DS Waters has flaunted the letter
of the law on numerous occasions.

39:46.760 --> 39:48.120
Shh. It's unbecoming.

39:49.520 --> 39:53.520
I did warn you, she's no charmer,
but I'll let you be Caesar.

39:58.520 --> 40:00.800
Let's see if you can cause
less damage tomorrow.

40:04.160 --> 40:06.280
Paedo routine's a new one.

40:06.400 --> 40:08.160
Marks for originality.

40:08.280 --> 40:09.240
Piss off.

40:11.880 --> 40:13.640
She'll get there.

40:13.760 --> 40:15.840
You were a babe once yourself.

40:18.360 --> 40:21.800
Old case of yours
has come up for parole.

40:21.920 --> 40:24.800
Belmarsh appears
to have had enough of him.

40:24.920 --> 40:27.680
What, Skittle's
out on good behaviour?

40:27.800 --> 40:30.680
I'm afraid CPS needs you
at the hearing.

40:31.960 --> 40:35.840
Gabriel, it was a long road
bringing you back.

40:52.760 --> 40:55.920
I haven't worn that guy
in a long time.

40:57.760 --> 40:59.160
He was a beautiful boy.

40:59.280 --> 41:01.560
Scared the daylights out of me,
though.

41:14.200 --> 41:17.320
BEEPING, PHONE RINGING

41:21.280 --> 41:22.840
Look, if you're not
going to answer it,

41:22.960 --> 41:24.760
can you put that thing
on silent, please?

41:24.880 --> 41:25.920
Yousef...

41:26.040 --> 41:26.960
Yo.

41:27.080 --> 41:29.840
PHONE STILL RINGING

41:39.880 --> 41:42.960
This is Yousef. You know what to do.

41:43.080 --> 41:44.240
BEEP

41:45.640 --> 41:47.680
No sleep just yet, lad.

41:47.800 --> 41:49.520
Nightmare's almost over.

41:52.760 --> 41:55.400
Adrian Hodge, your legal aid.

41:55.520 --> 41:58.120
Been chasing your ghost all day.

41:58.240 --> 42:02.000
First things first,
any one you need to call?

42:02.120 --> 42:03.680
Just plead me guilty already.

42:03.800 --> 42:06.400
I've been here forever.
When do I go home?

42:06.520 --> 42:09.560
You're going in front of
the magistrate first thing.

42:09.680 --> 42:10.880
Now why are you here, Raza?

42:11.000 --> 42:12.920
Should have turned you out
already with a charge.

42:13.040 --> 42:14.120
They said I was a flight risk.

42:14.240 --> 42:16.320
You don't have an accent.

42:16.440 --> 42:18.120
Got family abroad, have you?

42:19.280 --> 42:21.040
Someone's pulling your chain, lad.

42:21.160 --> 42:23.920
Look, what I'd like to do tomorrow
is lodge a formal complaint...

42:24.040 --> 42:25.640
No, man. No complaints.

42:25.760 --> 42:27.440
I'm not just going
to get you out, lad.

42:27.560 --> 42:30.480
I'll get the case dropped,
keep your record clean,

42:30.600 --> 42:31.520
that's for your future.

42:31.640 --> 42:34.080
Look, if they mark you,
brand you, career,

42:34.200 --> 42:35.800
mortgage loan,
for the rest of your life,

42:35.920 --> 42:38.440
that's the first question they ask.
And I promise you, Raza,

42:38.560 --> 42:41.720
Simon White Face or whoever,
with his Jesus and his Eton

42:41.840 --> 42:45.000
and his Oxbridge,
he's not checking that box.

42:46.480 --> 42:49.560
I'm not trying to bleed
the Matrix, bruv.

42:49.680 --> 42:51.240
Just get me out.

43:13.640 --> 43:15.720
Christ, don't you ever knock?

43:20.280 --> 43:24.200
How intelligent do you look getting
duped by a low-rent pusher?

43:24.320 --> 43:25.880
- Sir...
- You told me you had a snout

43:26.000 --> 43:27.880
with a bead on El Adoua's
man in London.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.200
You swore up and down
your man was reliable.

43:30.320 --> 43:33.000
Now he's in the wind and I'm left
cursing the weather.

43:33.120 --> 43:38.080
Some bear fruit, most don't.

43:38.200 --> 43:42.480
Italian AC are closing in
on attack cell in Turin.

43:42.600 --> 43:46.000
If El Adoua has taught those
pillocks how to build the same bomb

43:46.120 --> 43:48.120
that took 17 lives in Rotterdam,

43:48.240 --> 43:50.240
he was in London
long enough to do the same.

43:50.360 --> 43:53.120
I promise you, we're doing
everything we can

43:53.240 --> 43:55.040
to find his network.

43:55.160 --> 43:58.480
So, I promised Downing Street
Rotterdam won't happen here.

43:58.600 --> 44:00.840
You promised me
your snout's good word.

44:00.960 --> 44:04.200
History teaches us wars
are fought with bombs and bullets.

44:04.320 --> 44:07.280
Promises are buried
along with the dead.

44:12.480 --> 44:14.400
There he is,
Mr Get Out of Jail Free.

44:14.520 --> 44:15.840
Take care of my parking tickets,

44:15.960 --> 44:18.040
I'll tell you how to find
the Loch Ness Monster.

44:18.160 --> 44:19.440
Oh, not even a smile.

44:19.560 --> 44:21.560
He's been working on
that joke all morning.

44:21.680 --> 44:23.240
Time well spent, lads.

44:23.360 --> 44:26.240
Found El Adoua's London contacts,
have we?

44:29.160 --> 44:30.800
All right, today,
we're in the haystack.

44:30.920 --> 44:32.120
Pull up the watchlist.

44:32.240 --> 44:34.320
I'll take A to E, you take F to J.

44:34.440 --> 44:37.320
- Let's see who was is in the country.
- What about Yousef?

44:37.440 --> 44:38.880
We're not looking for Yousef.

44:39.000 --> 44:39.880
Oh!

44:40.000 --> 44:41.800
It's just I found him.

44:54.800 --> 44:55.720
So...

44:55.840 --> 44:58.480
..here's Yousef leaving his flat.

44:59.960 --> 45:00.960
Wait for it.

45:04.040 --> 45:05.440
White van.

45:05.560 --> 45:08.880
Here he is again, leaving the gym
20 minutes prior to your meet.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.760
Looks like the same
white van tailing him.

45:13.880 --> 45:14.920
See.

45:16.200 --> 45:20.480
And, here is six minutes
later on Nelson.

45:22.760 --> 45:23.720
Plates on the van?

45:23.840 --> 45:25.520
Unreadable. Reflectors.

45:26.720 --> 45:28.400
Did he know to watch for tails?

45:28.520 --> 45:29.560
Yeah.

45:29.680 --> 45:30.800
Where did they go next?

45:30.920 --> 45:33.360
I checked the surrounding feeds.
Both vehicles disappeared.

45:33.480 --> 45:35.640
- I'll keep sifting.
- 400,000 cameras in London.

45:35.760 --> 45:38.120
That's not sifting, that's drowning.

45:38.240 --> 45:40.920
Check with Audi,
see if his GPS is still pinging.

45:41.040 --> 45:43.600
I'll ask the guv to put
in for a warrant.

45:43.720 --> 45:45.880
Nah, she won't want the bother.

45:46.000 --> 45:50.800
Just get the VIN number and tell
them you're hunting for joyriders.

45:50.920 --> 45:52.440
Good work.

45:54.280 --> 45:55.600
Cheers.

45:58.440 --> 46:00.080
Karrol Jada...

46:00.200 --> 46:01.960
- SIGHS
- ..Gyay-da...

46:02.080 --> 46:03.400
Giedzinski.

46:03.520 --> 46:04.720
That'll be the one.

46:15.600 --> 46:16.680
Are they dodge?

46:18.000 --> 46:18.920
Not bad.

46:19.040 --> 46:21.040
- What's that?
- Your creps.

46:21.160 --> 46:22.520
Where d'you nab them?

46:22.640 --> 46:24.760
Deptford market.

46:24.880 --> 46:28.200
Got a mate who runs a stall,
Watney market.

46:28.320 --> 46:29.760
Does fakes for a tenner.

46:32.800 --> 46:34.360
You always wanted
to be a lawyer, then?

46:34.480 --> 46:36.880
Why? Are you thinking
of joining the cause, lad?

46:37.000 --> 46:38.200
Good to have options, innit?

46:38.320 --> 46:39.640
Life's not an orchard.

46:39.760 --> 46:41.760
Don't get to stroll through,
pick the fruit you want.

46:41.880 --> 46:43.120
Nah, I could be a lawyer.

46:43.240 --> 46:44.520
Seems legit.

46:45.840 --> 46:48.800
So, you've got, like,
assistants and that?

46:48.920 --> 46:50.600
Interns.

46:50.720 --> 46:53.360
But they're not pratting about
getting themselves arrested.

46:58.080 --> 46:59.760
What, you didn't fancy uni, then?

46:59.880 --> 47:00.920
Circumstances, bruv.

47:01.040 --> 47:03.760
Didn't matter what I fancied.

47:03.880 --> 47:06.280
What keeps you busy now?

47:06.400 --> 47:07.800
Domestic shipping.

47:07.920 --> 47:08.960
Postman, then.

47:09.080 --> 47:10.840
Nah, packing boxes.

47:14.000 --> 47:15.240
Interns.

47:15.360 --> 47:17.760
A bit like slave labour, innit?

47:17.880 --> 47:21.680
The day I can afford real kicks
is the day I pay my interns.

47:21.800 --> 47:23.480
Raza Shar.

47:26.960 --> 47:29.320
NFA. Your case is dismissed.

47:29.440 --> 47:31.560
We've been sat here all morning.
When did that happen?

47:31.680 --> 47:35.040
About 30 seconds ago
when CPS phoned the clerk.

47:39.160 --> 47:40.600
Go on, then.

47:40.720 --> 47:42.760
Get out while you still can.

47:52.800 --> 47:54.440
Freedom!

47:57.080 --> 47:59.960
You look tired, mate.
Do you need a lift?

48:00.080 --> 48:01.400
I ain't got nothing to say to you.

48:01.520 --> 48:03.360
What, not even "thank you"?

48:03.480 --> 48:05.320
Who do think got
your charges dropped?

48:05.440 --> 48:07.960
Same twat that had me locked up
in the first place, seems like.

48:08.080 --> 48:09.960
Same twat that ain't got shit
on me now, anyway.

48:10.080 --> 48:11.640
Not on you, I don't.

48:11.760 --> 48:15.760
Your mum, on the other hand -
overstayed her visa by about,

48:15.880 --> 48:17.640
ooh, 16 years.

48:20.760 --> 48:22.880
Jump in the car,
we'll talk about it.

48:42.120 --> 48:43.600
What do you want with my mum?

48:43.720 --> 48:45.600
So he does speak.

48:45.720 --> 48:48.440
She's not your mum, is she?

48:48.560 --> 48:51.160
Look, I've got some friends
at the Home Office.

48:51.280 --> 48:54.120
They won't go anywhere near her,
long as I say.

48:54.240 --> 48:57.160
You mean as long as I snitch?

48:57.280 --> 48:59.960
You just have to report
to me once a week.

49:00.080 --> 49:04.120
Keep me posted on people you talk
to, things that you hear.

49:04.240 --> 49:05.760
Who am I talking to?

49:07.440 --> 49:09.640
I work counter-terrorism.

49:09.760 --> 49:11.760
I don't know any fucking
terrorists, bruv.

49:11.880 --> 49:14.680
Not yet you don't,
but we'll get you there.

49:14.800 --> 49:17.160
Look, your identity will be
protected

49:17.280 --> 49:20.400
and there's perks to knowing
people like me.

49:20.520 --> 49:22.960
Your dad's been released already,
I've taken care of that.

49:23.080 --> 49:24.200
My dad?

49:24.320 --> 49:25.160
How's that?

49:25.280 --> 49:27.880
Bit of a card, isn't he, your dad?

49:28.000 --> 49:31.840
Look, I really don't know
how I'm supposed to help you.

49:31.960 --> 49:35.840
I've got to run a quick errand, so,
pardon the detour, yeah?

49:35.960 --> 49:38.280
SIREN

49:49.440 --> 49:51.200
What is this place?

49:51.320 --> 49:52.560
Why are you bringing me here?

49:52.680 --> 49:55.040
Have you heard about
that Rotterdam bombing?

49:55.160 --> 49:57.320
17 dead, 63 injured.

49:57.440 --> 49:59.640
Why do you think they do it?

49:59.760 --> 50:00.760
To hurt people.

50:00.880 --> 50:02.400
To scare people.

50:02.520 --> 50:04.840
People don't feel safe, they panic.

50:04.960 --> 50:07.880
Blame anyone
that doesn't look like them.

50:08.000 --> 50:09.720
Then they start
building places like this.

50:09.840 --> 50:11.880
Say it loud, say it clear.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.560
Refugees are not welcome here.

50:14.680 --> 50:16.200
GATE CLANKS, BUZZER SOUNDS

50:17.200 --> 50:18.240
Afternoon, Neil.

50:18.360 --> 50:20.160
How's the private sector?

50:20.280 --> 50:21.240
Underworked, overpaid.

50:21.360 --> 50:23.440
Always looking for new blood
if you fancy a pay rise.

50:23.560 --> 50:25.000
You're all right, thank you.

50:25.120 --> 50:26.760
How's everything with the lads?

50:26.880 --> 50:28.960
Young 'un got into a fight
at Sunday league.

50:29.080 --> 50:30.160
Bloody mess.

50:30.280 --> 50:31.760
Line-up's ready for you.

50:31.880 --> 50:32.920
Thank you.

50:36.680 --> 50:38.480
Poor sods.

50:38.600 --> 50:42.880
Lost a game of snakes and ladders,
now they're back on the bottom.

50:43.000 --> 50:45.040
I'll grass for you.
You don't need to threaten me.

50:46.680 --> 50:47.800
Relax, Raza.

50:54.520 --> 50:55.560
Pick one.

50:56.960 --> 51:00.320
- One what?
- Whichever man you choose gets to stay.

51:02.080 --> 51:03.560
Stay?

51:03.680 --> 51:04.720
Like stay.

51:05.880 --> 51:07.480
How?

51:08.560 --> 51:10.320
Well, just choose one.

51:10.440 --> 51:13.800
- Why do want me to do it?
- Because we're working together now.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.560
- This is fucked.
- Neil, no-one gets to ride free today.

51:19.680 --> 51:21.280
No, no. OK, shit.

51:21.400 --> 51:22.440
I'll do it.

51:25.040 --> 51:27.320
How am I supposed to choose?

51:27.440 --> 51:29.120
I don't know.

51:29.240 --> 51:31.520
Nicest hat, friendliest face.

51:39.640 --> 51:40.760
Him.

51:41.880 --> 51:43.320
Which one?

51:43.440 --> 51:45.680
Come and point him out to me.

51:52.440 --> 51:54.240
This guy?

51:54.360 --> 51:55.800
Stand up.

51:55.920 --> 51:57.000
Yeah, stand up.

52:00.720 --> 52:01.840
Come here.

52:06.560 --> 52:07.640
You understand English?

52:09.560 --> 52:11.320
Where are you from?

52:11.440 --> 52:13.040
Afghanistan, boss.

52:14.040 --> 52:15.520
What's your name?

52:15.640 --> 52:19.080
Rostam Avshar, boss.

52:19.200 --> 52:21.080
Welcome to England, Rostam.

52:23.760 --> 52:25.600
Boss?

52:25.720 --> 52:27.400
You remember this face.

52:28.920 --> 52:31.720
This is the man that
changed your life.

52:36.360 --> 52:38.360
Thank you.

52:38.480 --> 52:39.880
Rostam, come with me.

53:40.480 --> 53:42.520
VIBRATING

53:46.840 --> 53:49.000
This is Yousef. You know what to do.

53:50.520 --> 53:52.880
Yousef, Post Office.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.600
I'm afraid we've dumped
that package of yours.

53:55.720 --> 53:59.760
That does leave an outstanding
balance on your account.

54:01.160 --> 54:03.040
You'll be hearing from us.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.160
Hello.
How are my two favourite ladies?

54:25.280 --> 54:27.440
- Hi.
- Hi, Daddy.

54:27.560 --> 54:28.760
No hugs for me, then?

54:28.880 --> 54:31.280
You don't want paint
all over you, Daddy.

54:31.400 --> 54:33.960
Hey, Ems, I thought
we'd settled on the duck egg.

54:34.080 --> 54:36.760
Don't ask me.
I'm not in charge.

54:36.880 --> 54:38.600
Come on, then.
I'll take over from here.

54:38.720 --> 54:40.240
But, I'm not done yet.

54:40.360 --> 54:42.680
Hey, it's late. Come on, Laurie.

54:42.800 --> 54:44.960
You've got paint all over you.
Get cleaned up.

54:46.480 --> 54:48.520
And I'll know if you haven't
brushed your teeth.

54:48.640 --> 54:50.120
All right, all right.

54:51.640 --> 54:53.000
- You look tired.
- Oh, thanks.

54:54.760 --> 54:57.920
You still look a lot better than
the last guy that came to paint my walls.

54:59.200 --> 55:02.240
Hello, stranger.
What have you been up to?

55:02.360 --> 55:03.920
This and that. You?

55:05.400 --> 55:06.800
This and that.

56:01.360 --> 56:03.840
You're back.

56:05.520 --> 56:08.400
I thought you'd moved
to bloody Shoreditch.

56:35.360 --> 56:37.000
_

56:37.480 --> 56:40.640
You don't just send a canary
straight down the mine.

56:40.760 --> 56:43.480
You've got to put him
in a cage first.

56:47.440 --> 56:49.240
He knew the risks.

56:49.360 --> 56:50.640
No, he didn't.

56:52.040 --> 56:53.080
They never do.

56:55.120 --> 56:57.440
If they did, they wouldn't do it.

57:02.600 --> 57:04.600
What happened to
"They're not your friends?"

57:06.280 --> 57:07.680
They're not.

57:10.240 --> 57:11.680
But you're theirs.

57:12.600 --> 57:14.600
You know their biggest secret.

57:17.120 --> 57:20.440
All they want to know is,
are you going to keep us safe?

57:24.360 --> 57:27.000
You lie about anything else,
you don't lie about that.
