I mean,
I used a lot of guys in my day,

17:42.061 --> 17:43.975
but I just sort of fell into it.

17:44.019 --> 17:46.152
Drink with them,
sleep with them,

17:46.195 --> 17:49.285
maybe get some blow
and a free McMuffin out of it.

17:51.244 --> 17:53.550
But I never went into it
with a plan.

17:53.594 --> 17:55.770
[sighs]: Well... you
always want your children

17:55.813 --> 17:57.467
to do better than you did.

17:59.426 --> 18:01.906
Oh, God, she isdoing better.
