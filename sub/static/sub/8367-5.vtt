00:00.660 --> 00:02.250
<i>Previously on Jericho</i>

00:03.820 --> 00:06.520
All right,it looks like the explosion
came from the west, maybe Denver.

00:06.520 --> 00:07.560
This could've been a test,

00:07.560 --> 00:08.580
could've been an accident.

00:08.580 --> 00:11.340
But if it was an attack
and there's chaos out there

00:12.060 --> 00:13.520
you might not want the wrong people knowing

00:13.520 --> 00:14.800
that Jericho is still here.

00:14.805 --> 00:18.533
The unfortunate truth is
there was another explosion in Atlanta.

00:19.031 --> 00:20.747
Oh,my God, we got something!

00:20.746 --> 00:22.380
Were they just reporting it
or are they behind it?

00:22.386 --> 00:24.238
Hire as many deputies as you can.

00:24.237 --> 00:25.671
Use them to help you get gas.

00:25.755 --> 00:26.990
Clinic's running low.

00:27.507 --> 00:29.251
Couldn't find an empty pesticide container.

00:29.257 --> 00:31.720
--thought this water tank might do.
--No,no,no, we can't use steel.

00:31.735 --> 00:33.323
There's too much risk of static.

00:33.326 --> 00:35.241
The gas has been sloshing around in there.

00:35.246 --> 00:36.862
One spark,the whole thing could blow sky high.

00:36.868 --> 00:39.081
We don't have time to look for something else.

00:41.025 --> 00:41.843
Help.

00:42.085 --> 00:43.402
He's a refugee from Denver.

00:43.406 --> 00:45.343
--You recognize him?
--No.

00:45.347 --> 00:46.551
We need information.

00:48.058 --> 00:51.073
--Where are they?
--It burns.
--He needs morphine.

00:52.937 --> 00:57.731
--Why did you go back to Denver?
--I couldn't let them die.

00:57.738 --> 00:59.322
Well,it was a mistake,Vic...

00:59.756 --> 01:01.772
because now we are a man down.

01:04.275 --> 01:05.290
He's gone.

01:16.767 --> 01:18.432
I'm tired of War.

01:18.495 --> 01:20.513
--No one ever really wins.
--Me,too.

01:22.017 --> 01:24.512
Guess we can play Crazy Eights instead.

01:24.925 --> 01:26.012
Or Hearts?

01:26.195 --> 01:27.291
I'm calling it a night.

01:27.408 --> 01:28.312
You can call it whatever you want

01:28.318 --> 01:30.681
but it stopped being night hours ago.

01:31.015 --> 01:32.973
--Y'all want coffee?
--Mm.
--Mm

01:33.708 --> 01:34.881
Make mine an Irish.

01:38.278 --> 01:39.841
So,Mimi,what would you be doing

01:39.848 --> 01:43.840
--if you were back home in D.C.?
--Sleeping.

01:44.495 --> 01:46.842
--You know the hardest thing
about sleeping in this dump?
--What?

01:46.848 --> 01:48.053
The quiet.

01:48.447 --> 01:49.482
I don't know how you stand it.

01:49.488 --> 01:52.960
--It's like my brain is an echo chamber.
--Well,why do you think I left town?

01:53.715 --> 01:54.530
I could tell her.

01:55.195 --> 01:56.253
What?

01:56.556 --> 01:58.990
--Why Jake left town.
--Hey,watch it,Jimmy.

01:59.805 --> 02:00.822
Let me guess.

02:01.377 --> 02:03.731
--The pressure got to be too much.
--Wow.

02:03.937 --> 02:05.500
--I'm a people reader.
--Yeah.

02:06.066 --> 02:08.990
I'm betting captain of the football team

02:09.187 --> 02:10.353
prom king...

02:10.866 --> 02:12.540
most likely to succeed.

02:12.815 --> 02:13.942
Am I right?

02:14.837 --> 02:16.243
Don't quit your day job.

02:16.755 --> 02:21.770
--Why? What am I missing here?
--I think he beat up the prom king.

02:22.116 --> 02:23.603
Oh,yeah,I did.

02:24.538 --> 02:27.410
Eric,you must have a million
stories about your brother screwing up,right?

02:29.927 --> 02:31.201
Yeah,at least that many.

02:33.998 --> 02:37.333
--Could we get a couple coffees to go,Mary?
--Coming up.

02:38.477 --> 02:39.382
So...

02:40.168 --> 02:41.520
do we have a plan?

02:43.406 --> 02:44.450
Uh...

02:44.767 --> 02:47.232
just try to get news, make contact.

02:47.235 --> 02:51.192
--We haven't heard from Gray
in a couple days,so...
--No,Eric...

02:52.017 --> 02:53.573
do we have a plan?

02:57.706 --> 03:00.232
I will talk to April tonight.

03:01.916 --> 03:02.931
Then?

03:03.948 --> 03:07.313
And then I won't need coffee as
an excuse to come see you.

03:14.968 --> 03:16.761
Secrets of a small town.

04:04.766 --> 04:05.430
Hello

04:06.028 --> 04:10.513
Hello,this is Assistant Secretary Walsh
from the Department of Homeland Security.

04:10.768 --> 04:11.853
Do not be alarmed.

04:12.415 --> 04:14.820
If you are safe, stay where you are.

04:15.168 --> 04:17.002
--Do not attempt to leave.
--Who is it,Rob?

04:17.237 --> 04:19.232
We will be in contact again shortly.

04:19.516 --> 04:22.430
Until then,know that help is on the way.

04:23.557 --> 04:27.822
Hello,this is Assistant Secretary Walsh
from the Department of Homeland Security.

04:27.985 --> 04:29.100
Do not be alarmed.

04:29.508 --> 04:30.162
If you are safe,

04:30.368 --> 04:31.572
stay where you are.

04:31.827 --> 04:33.623
Do not attempt to leave...

04:52.125 --> 04:54.522
--to Town Hall,you good?
--Yeah

04:54.576 --> 04:57.103
--Homeland Security?
--That's what they said.

04:57.338 --> 05:01.423
--So they're in charge now?
--Well,they're supposed to be in
charge in case of a disaster.

05:01.428 --> 05:02.482
So what happens next?

05:02.638 --> 05:03.533
Why are you asking her?

05:03.535 --> 05:05.541
--She's from the IRS.
--She's from D.C.

05:05.545 --> 05:06.951
This is what they told us.

05:06.957 --> 05:08.340
First,they restore power,

05:08.508 --> 05:09.712
then communication,

05:09.875 --> 05:11.351
then  transportation.

05:11.668 --> 05:14.702
I am this close to non-fat lattes and shiatsu.

05:15.387 --> 05:16.630
Does anybody have a quarter?

05:16.766 --> 05:18.962
If they can call in, maybe we can call out.

05:33.668 --> 05:36.643
--Hey,did your phone ring?
--Yeah,everyone's did.

05:36.648 --> 05:38.312
--All the land lines in town.
--Why?

05:38.507 --> 05:41.540
Because Kansas has a reverse 911 system.

05:41.548 --> 05:42.342
If there's an emergency,

05:42.346 --> 05:44.720
it just pulses out we all heard.

05:44.905 --> 05:46.330
Why can't we call out?

05:46.335 --> 05:48.581
Everybody's trying to use
the phone at the same time.

05:48.587 --> 05:49.933
System's overloaded.

05:50.257 --> 05:51.692
You think the power's back for good?

05:51.696 --> 05:53.740
I don't know, I'm not gonna count on it.

05:58.668 --> 06:00.221
Hey,Skylar.

06:00.977 --> 06:02.712
--Any luck?
--No.

06:02.715 --> 06:04.182
I really need to check my e-mail.

06:04.187 --> 06:06.450
I mean,my parents could've tried to
contact me from New York.

06:06.456 --> 06:10.022
--Well,have you tried typing a straight IP address?
--A what?

06:16.635 --> 06:18.272
--It's weird.
--What?

06:18.988 --> 06:20.830
Well,the Internet was built by the military.

06:20.835 --> 06:23.191
It's supposed to survive nuclear war.

06:23.468 --> 06:25.513
So why can't I check my e-mail?

06:28.028 --> 06:29.610
--Whoa.
--Allison.

06:29.615 --> 06:30.882
Is  it working now?

06:33.567 --> 06:34.880
It is,but...

06:35.277 --> 06:36.910
not for us.

06:37.938 --> 06:39.642
We're being blocked out.

07:06.808 --> 07:07.932
Uh,miss?

07:07.957 --> 07:10.600
--You can't do that.
--Yeah,okay,thanks.

07:11.025 --> 07:12.002
Okay.

07:13.538 --> 07:14.513
Come on.

07:16.467 --> 07:17.471
No.

07:18.375 --> 07:22.440
--Your machine just ate my card.
--Doesn't work.

07:22.775 --> 07:25.773
--That's what I tried to tell you.
--Thank you.

07:26.156 --> 07:27.563
You're just so helpful.

07:35.105 --> 07:36.201
Hey,Dad.

07:37.188 --> 07:40.300
--It's the same thing on every channel?
--So far.

07:40.695 --> 07:43.791
--What about the radio?
--Same message-- sit and wait.

07:46.478 --> 07:48.042
You look like crap.

07:48.856 --> 07:50.273
I didn't sleep.

07:51.096 --> 07:53.432
Next time put the cards down, go home.

07:55.727 --> 07:57.841
Sooner or later, the phones are gonna free up.

07:57.846 --> 08:00.993
--Let's keep calling out until we reach somebody.
--Calling who?

08:01.325 --> 08:03.951
Well,that Homeland Security message
came out of Topeka;

08:03.958 --> 08:04.990
let's start there.

08:05.815 --> 08:07.893
Yeah,but everybody's v

08:07.898 --> 08:10.842
I  say we start with
the National Guard base in Great Bend.

08:12.596 --> 08:14.112
That's a good idea,son.

08:14.276 --> 08:17.590
--We should get to the gas station,
get some gas while...
--I already sent Jimmy.

08:17.788 --> 08:19.451
He's there now running the pumps.

08:19.761 --> 08:21.777
All right,well,we need to charge our batteries.

08:25.536 --> 08:26.630
All right.

08:26.806 --> 08:28.208
Looks like you got it covered.

08:28.946 --> 08:31.780
--Where you going?
--Home.

08:39.827 --> 08:40.953
You take a shower?

08:41.515 --> 08:42.991
Nothing gets past you.

08:43.226 --> 08:45.792
--Go clean the tub and fill it up.
--Why?

08:50.406 --> 08:53.121
The water doesn't get to that shower by magic.

08:53.437 --> 08:54.521
If the power goes out again,

08:54.528 --> 08:56.430
so do the pumps that get it there.

08:56.437 --> 08:58.793
So we store what we can.

08:59.766 --> 09:01.042
That is why...

09:09.036 --> 09:10.910
She is your daughter,Rob,

09:12.116 --> 09:13.362
not your employee.

09:15.316 --> 09:16.330
Well...

09:16.795 --> 09:21.392
--she needs to talk less and listen more.
--You need to learn ease up on her.

09:26.377 --> 09:27.303
Darcy...

09:29.267 --> 09:31.901
I don't know how long I'll be here

09:32.878 --> 09:34.932
so whatever I gotta teach her

09:35.786 --> 09:37.421
it needs to happen now.

09:57.668 --> 09:59.882
You know,when we find out what's going on

10:00.358 --> 10:01.861
are you gonna stay or leave?

10:02.546 --> 10:05.832
--Don't think about that yet.
--Well,I can't help it.

10:05.836 --> 10:07.653
I finally have you back.

10:09.896 --> 10:12.503
You were always good at blocking out the bad.

10:13.155 --> 10:14.723
Dad,not so much.

10:15.237 --> 10:16.792
He's had more to block out.

10:17.418 --> 10:18.740
When you left,

10:20.255 --> 10:21.743
you left quite a mess.

10:22.128 --> 10:25.993
You have no idea of the lengths
you father went to to square things.

10:29.295 --> 10:33.020
--Then why didn't he talk to me?
--Because he knew you'd resent it.

10:33.535 --> 10:36.643
And there's a stubborn streak that runs in the family.

10:37.397 --> 10:38.333
Honey...

10:39.228 --> 10:40.861
I think you owe him the truth.

10:42.156 --> 10:43.943
You want me to tell him about my...

10:46.848 --> 10:48.252
...about my time away?

10:53.078 --> 10:55.603
This house is too small for big secrets.

10:59.568 --> 11:00.590
What was that?

11:01.015 --> 11:02.350
It's a power spike.

11:06.606 --> 11:07.730
Boys..

11:09.338 --> 11:12.132
Wow,looks like business as usual.

11:12.137 --> 11:15.600
--How'd you get your kids back so quick?
--Always lead with recess.

11:15.907 --> 11:17.773
Got to get things back to normal.

11:18.888 --> 11:20.092
Whatever that is.

11:25.748 --> 11:27.193
Go! Go! Go!

11:27.318 --> 11:28.523
Hurry,hurry!

11:32.326 --> 11:33.171
Emily?

11:33.425 --> 11:34.240
Emily...

11:34.427 --> 11:36.462
Emily? Emily?

11:37.536 --> 11:38.773
Oh,my God.

11:45.607 --> 11:46.693
Emily,wake up.

11:47.008 --> 11:48.172
Emily,wake up.

11:49.975 --> 11:51.801
Uh,everybody...

11:52.235 --> 11:54.650
do you remember the emergency
drills we did at school?

11:55.307 --> 11:58.812
Okay. Go find your buddy and go
sit behind the fence.

11:59.558 --> 12:01.242
One,two,three,go!

12:01.245 --> 12:02.962
Come on,quickly.

12:02.967 --> 12:03.782
Go.

12:04.497 --> 12:06.652
Is she going to wake up?

12:07.356 --> 12:08.373
Yes.

12:08.776 --> 12:11.910
--With super powers?
--Probably not.

12:12.775 --> 12:14.090
Now,go. Go!

12:14.367 --> 12:15.650
Go,Lucas,go!

12:17.516 --> 12:19.031
Come on,Emily,come on.

12:19.808 --> 12:20.662
Wake up.

12:26.047 --> 12:27.160
Wonder when they're going to come.

12:27.356 --> 12:29.651
You really can't wait to fly this coop,huh?

12:34.128 --> 12:36.812
Are you still going to file
that IRS report on my farm?

12:37.157 --> 12:39.020
That's not exactly my first
order of business

12:39.028 --> 12:42.752
but it is the reason I fell into
this godforsaken hellhole in the first place.

12:43.335 --> 12:45.903
So is that a yes,no or maybe?

12:46.375 --> 12:48.672
It's an eventual

12:52.077 --> 12:53.652
Look,if it were up to me,

12:53.766 --> 12:55.282
I'd see what I could do.

12:57.008 --> 12:59.510
But that's probably just the Irish coffee talking.

13:02.505 --> 13:03.943
You got a family back home?

13:04.678 --> 13:05.743
I have fish.

13:06.946 --> 13:08.701
I'm sure they really miss you.

13:14.885 --> 13:16.603
I wonder what that's about.

13:16.638 --> 13:18.582
Mary,keep my tab open,will ya?

13:18.908 --> 13:24.372
--Your tab,Stanley?
--Yeah,and keep the Irish coffees coming.

13:24.875 --> 13:26.661
Till I get my farm back at least.

13:31.235 --> 13:32.520
You heard the hillbilly.

13:33.338 --> 13:34.541
Keep 'em coming.

14:28.456 --> 14:29.230
Okay,let's board her.

14:29.235 --> 14:31.371
Get an I.V. started and get some O2 on her.

14:31.566 --> 14:33.392
Keep an eye on the pulse
and let me know if her BP drops.

14:33.397 --> 14:34.983
We got to keep an eye on her.

14:43.546 --> 14:46.241
--Where's  Ashlee?
--She went to get Alice.

14:46.586 --> 14:51.172
--Alice? Alice in Wonderland?
Inside?
--Uh-huh.

14:59.188 --> 15:01.791
Ashlee? Ashlee!

15:02.886 --> 15:03.903
Ashlee?

15:04.926 --> 15:05.721
Honey?

15:05.725 --> 15:06.861
Ashlee,honey.

15:07.877 --> 15:09.670
Ashlee,it's Ms. Lisinski.

15:10.958 --> 15:13.841
Ashlee! Ashlee!

15:21.718 --> 15:25.082
--Chief,we've got another blaze
over on the South Side. Over.
--Copy that.

15:25.085 --> 15:26.681
We've got a second fire.

15:26.846 --> 15:28.640
It's South Side near the trailer park.

15:28.645 --> 15:30.622
But we don't have enough guys to fight this one.

15:30.625 --> 15:32.842
They'll come back as soon as they can.

15:33.078 --> 15:35.763
Take the second truck. Move!

15:40.388 --> 15:42.610
Truck 77,let's get a ladder up there.

15:47.648 --> 15:50.090
--What happened?
--Looks like she got hit with a lot of voltage.

15:51.028 --> 15:52.151
Go ahead,lock it in!

15:52.515 --> 15:53.793
How'd it start?

15:54.087 --> 15:57.122
--Power lines.
--Power lines? Hold the water.

15:57.127 --> 15:59.680
--What's wrong?
--Electrical fire.

16:00.175 --> 16:03.573
Spray water on electricity
everybody it touches gets fried.

16:14.876 --> 16:15.853
Johnston.

16:17.105 --> 16:18.892
I thought you were at the ranch.

16:18.948 --> 16:20.590
The horses are safe.

16:21.135 --> 16:22.572
What about the stables?

16:23.155 --> 16:25.543
--There's nothing but dirtaround for miles.
--They're fine.

16:25.606 --> 16:27.982
You are not going to that fire.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.923
I let Chief Carrol and half
the department go to Denver.

16:30.926 --> 16:33.642
--We're  down to a handful of men.
--Who can handle it.

16:33.956 --> 16:36.220
Johnston,if you get
any sicker than you already are

16:36.225 --> 16:38.680
you're not going to be any use to anybody.

16:38.688 --> 16:40.821
Dad,Dad,are you still there?

16:41.086 --> 16:42.453
Yeah,Eric,I'm on my way.

16:42.568 --> 16:47.043
No,no,no,no,go downstairs
and turn off the power grid to the library.

16:47.817 --> 16:49.250
Give me five minutes.

16:49.455 --> 16:50.801
Looks like you get your way.

16:50.806 --> 16:53.100
--They can use me here.
--Good.

16:54.387 --> 16:55.653
The power should be cut in five minutes.

16:55.658 --> 16:57.110
Get your men in position.

17:06.607 --> 17:08.569
Cover one-seven four blocks east of Maple.

17:08.576 --> 17:09.881
Uh,one call. Stand by.

17:12.385 --> 17:15.221
--What are you doing?
--Making sure she didn't have a heart attack.

17:19.464 --> 17:20.323
Hey...

17:21.385 --> 17:22.660
You're in good hands.

17:30.128 --> 17:32.260
--Power's down.
--You're good to go.
-Copy.

17:32.375 --> 17:33.853
All right,that's it, power's down.

17:33.855 --> 17:35.281
Okay,open them up.

17:35.967 --> 17:37.982
--They're on.
--Okay.

17:48.725 --> 17:51.881
--What's going on?
--We lost pressure.

17:52.737 --> 17:53.740
Oh,my God.

17:53.887 --> 17:56.360
Pumping station must be on
the same power grid as us.

17:56.555 --> 17:58.510
--When we lost power to one...
--We cut into both.

17:58.518 --> 18:00.883
--Where's the pumping station?
--Up the hill at the end of Chaparral.

18:01.255 --> 18:02.400
Unhook those hoses.

18:02.407 --> 18:05.160
--See if there's a working hydrant around back.
--Right,Chief.

18:07.328 --> 18:09.631
--Hey,Jake.
--Stanley.

18:10.665 --> 18:11.561
Thank God.

18:12.077 --> 18:14.963
--Chaparral,pumping station, let's go.
--Got it.

18:14.966 --> 18:15.841
Heather...

18:15.975 --> 18:17.533
Where's what?

18:17.647 --> 18:19.441
Heather? Where's Heather?

18:19.445 --> 18:21.393
--Eric.
--Yeah?

18:21.396 --> 18:23.252
I think Heather might still be inside.

18:23.256 --> 18:25.692
--Nah,they said they cleared the building.
--Are you sure?

18:30.696 --> 18:31.942
Ventilate that area.

18:32.768 --> 18:34.442
Eric,what are you doing?

18:34.635 --> 18:35.883
Eric,no!

18:39.588 --> 18:42.071
I wonder what Lindsay Lohan
is doing right now.

18:42.078 --> 18:43.591
Do you think she's still alive?

18:43.597 --> 18:46.110
I'm trying to find my parents,
Lisa. I could care less.

18:46.495 --> 18:48.371
Great. My battery's almost dead.

18:48.646 --> 18:50.511
Excuse me,sorry.

18:51.058 --> 18:53.941
--Do you guys sell phone chargers?
--Um,what kind of phone?

18:56.058 --> 18:58.631
--I'll check the back.
--Thanks.

19:00.355 --> 19:04.232
--Why do you like that freak?
--Why do you like stupid, bulimic actresses?

19:04.237 --> 19:06.042
Whoa,incoming.

19:06.345 --> 19:09.853
Whoa,Sean, no skateboards.
Read the sign.

19:10.078 --> 19:11.412
Hey,you guys got to check it out.

19:11.415 --> 19:13.222
The library's burning, and I didn't even do it.

19:13.375 --> 19:15.742
--Is anyone hurt?
--Probably.

19:15.746 --> 19:19.442
--Sky,let's go.
--Go ahead,I'll catch up.
--Come on.

19:19.897 --> 19:22.500
This one says universal, so it should work.

19:23.047 --> 19:25.522
Um,we were going to go check out the fire.

19:25.527 --> 19:27.353
--If you want to...
--Dale.

19:27.586 --> 19:30.381
Make sure our extinguishers are working,
will ya?

19:31.516 --> 19:32.802
I should stay.

19:33.436 --> 19:37.051
--But if you want,I could charge
it and you could come back.
--Okay.

19:37.556 --> 19:41.762
--Um,if my parents call...
--I'll find you.

19:42.466 --> 19:43.591
Thanks.

19:52.195 --> 19:53.322
Come on,if we can open the valve

19:53.325 --> 19:54.871
we can get water to the fire.

20:00.468 --> 20:01.510
Ashlee?

20:11.946 --> 20:13.582
Hey,Ashlee.

20:13.775 --> 20:14.523
Let's get out of here.

20:14.647 --> 20:16.150
Let's go. Come on.

20:16.238 --> 20:17.482
Is anyone here?

20:17.645 --> 20:20.302
--Heather?
--Come on. Let's go.

20:20.557 --> 20:21.911
Hey,come on,let's go.

20:21.918 --> 20:25.991
--Better do what the angry fireman says. Let's go.
--Come on,this way,let's go!

20:36.805 --> 20:37.742
Damn.

20:40.317 --> 20:42.722
--It's not going to budge.
--Thanks,Stanley

20:42.967 --> 20:45.943
--How do you even know this is it?
--Trust me, it's the manual override.

20:45.948 --> 20:50.733
--When the power spiked the solenoid valves
shut down in the off position.
--What? Dude,you're freaking me out.

20:50.735 --> 20:52.563
--How do you even know that?
--How do you not?

20:56.708 --> 20:59.662
--Looks like nobody's touched it in years.
--Nobody has.

21:00.126 --> 21:02.492
The motor opens and closes it when the power's on.

21:02.605 --> 21:04.971
--No power,no motor.
--Yeah,and no water.

21:05.136 --> 21:08.052
Of course, right now what we
really need is leverage.

21:09.255 --> 21:10.231
You know what?

21:10.546 --> 21:11.632
Wait right here.

21:22.477 --> 21:27.241
--You can't go in there,ma'am.
--My husband's in there!
--Stand back,please.

21:33.786 --> 21:35.961
Ashlee,we're going to go out another way.

21:38.345 --> 21:40.293
--Are you okay?
--What's wrong?

21:40.636 --> 21:43.442
Uh... nothing,nothing.

21:43.446 --> 21:46.363
--We just got to use the other door.
--No,no,this way's blocked.

21:46.867 --> 21:47.871
Smoke!

21:49.107 --> 21:50.762
--We got to stop it.
--Okay,okay

21:50.767 --> 21:52.542
--uh,can we use this?
--Yeah.

21:52.545 --> 21:54.563
Okay,honey, I need you to get down

21:54.565 --> 21:56.661
and try not to breathe the smoke,all right?

21:56.846 --> 21:58.342
It's all going to be okay,Ashlee.

21:58.347 --> 21:59.732
It's going to be okay.

22:07.085 --> 22:07.980
Eric?

22:08.578 --> 22:10.270
We need another snake.

22:22.025 --> 22:24.550
Ashlee,I need you to crunch down here

22:24.588 --> 22:26.610
like a game of Leap Frog,okay?

22:35.036 --> 22:35.852
Ready?

22:44.097 --> 22:45.450
This is gonna help protect you.

22:56.588 --> 22:58.251
This'll protect you and help you breathe.

22:59.445 --> 23:00.141
Here.

23:02.047 --> 23:03.841
Here,breathe using this.

23:09.597 --> 23:10.482
Got it!

23:10.646 --> 23:11.812
We got it!

23:16.436 --> 23:18.690
It's running,it's running.We got water.

23:20.587 --> 23:22.033
We're gonna be okay.

23:22.415 --> 23:24.241
Hey! Hey!

23:24.818 --> 23:25.943
Come  on,this is our chance.

23:25.988 --> 23:27.470
Let's get the hell out of here!

23:28.158 --> 23:29.473
Come on,let's go!

23:31.786 --> 23:32.560
Okay.

23:35.957 --> 23:40.160
--Somebody has to go in there and help them!
--Ma'am,stay back,please.

23:42.246 --> 23:43.340
Oh,my God.

23:44.476 --> 23:46.661
--Are you hurt?
--No,don't worry about me.

23:46.667 --> 23:48.600
The little girl, she got a lot of smoke.

23:48.867 --> 23:50.813
April,can you take her?

23:51.246 --> 23:52.863
All right,yeah. Of course.

23:53.945 --> 23:55.201
You're gonna be okay,Ashlee.

24:06.148 --> 24:06.782
Give me the scope.

24:06.786 --> 24:09.003
I want to see if they have water
down at the library.

24:09.735 --> 24:14.403
--Listen... this scope was a Christmas present,okay?
--Relax.

24:14.755 --> 24:15.882
Careful.

24:29.185 --> 24:31.820
--What do you see?
--It's working.

24:32.126 --> 24:35.473
--They've got waterat the library.
--What about the South Side fire?

24:37.387 --> 24:40.232
Looks like the fire's out down
by the trailer park.

24:40.517 --> 24:42.150
There's a lot of smoke.

24:47.425 --> 24:48.623
There's another fire.

24:48.807 --> 24:51.143
--It's in the East Woods.
--What?!

24:53.706 --> 24:55.303
It's right near Eric's house.

24:59.458 --> 25:00.420
What the hell?

25:00.578 --> 25:02.633
What is it,Jake?
What's going on?

25:26.258 --> 25:27.850
April,April!

25:28.677 --> 25:31.320
Eric,Eric,there's another fire.

25:32.565 --> 25:34.390
We'll get to it as soon as we can.

25:34.878 --> 25:36.552
We need help clearing the alley.

25:36.678 --> 25:40.051
Eric.The fire's spreading.
Eric,it's heading to your house!

25:42.576 --> 25:43.583
What do you want to do?

25:46.715 --> 25:47.971
It's heading to your house.

25:51.098 --> 25:52.290
There's nothing to do.

25:52.467 --> 25:54.093
We're already spread too thin.

25:56.598 --> 25:57.410
If we don't stop the fire,

25:57.415 --> 25:58.772
it could take out Main Street.

25:59.696 --> 26:00.961
April?

26:04.566 --> 26:05.573
He's right.

26:23.725 --> 26:26.453
--What are you planning to do?
--Put out a fire.

26:27.118 --> 26:29.250
--Do you need a hand?
--I'm good.

26:34.995 --> 26:37.871
If I knew anything, I would tell your mayor.

26:38.416 --> 26:39.890
What do you know?

26:40.288 --> 26:41.331
Not much.

26:41.605 --> 26:43.971
I got the same message as everyone else.

26:46.228 --> 26:48.601
Do you want my help?

26:51.477 --> 26:52.690
Get in.

26:57.686 --> 26:59.821
First thing I'm gonna do when I get back to D.C.

26:59.826 --> 27:02.151
is burn these clothes.

27:04.148 --> 27:06.972
So,what's on your agenda once things settle?

27:07.708 --> 27:08.800
No agenda.

27:08.808 --> 27:12.300
Just looking forward to living my life.

27:13.888 --> 27:15.323
With Dudley Do Wrong?

27:16.937 --> 27:18.190
Never gonna happen.

27:20.056 --> 27:22.392
That's really none of your business.

27:23.015 --> 27:24.223
Besides...

27:25.197 --> 27:27.140
you don't know Eric the way I do.

27:27.538 --> 27:28.540
Mercifully.

27:29.635 --> 27:31.182
But I know his kind.

27:32.557 --> 27:35.743
Guys like that don't leave
wives for girls like us.

27:36.966 --> 27:38.173
"Girls like us"?

27:40.005 --> 27:42.811
I've been around this particular block before.

27:45.265 --> 27:48.790
Well,I'm sorry to blow your theory,but...

27:49.535 --> 27:52.331
Eric is telling his wife about us tonight.

27:52.676 --> 27:56.510
--Is he now?
--Yes,he is.

27:57.757 --> 27:59.310
Well,never mind,then.

28:01.456 --> 28:02.943
To the happy couple.

28:14.696 --> 28:16.630
Get up a littlehigher by that chimney.

28:17.687 --> 28:20.312
Hey,we got it!
We got it! Save your house!

28:22.676 --> 28:24.473
--What now?
--Water.

28:24.888 --> 28:26.333
Let's use the pool pump.

28:31.138 --> 28:32.300
Filter system.

28:33.825 --> 28:35.730
That's pretty smart,Jake.

28:36.435 --> 28:38.693
So where'd you learn to do all this?

28:39.275 --> 28:40.711
I was a pool guy.

28:51.186 --> 28:52.150
Turn it on!

28:55.498 --> 28:56.463
Turn it on!

28:57.608 --> 28:58.610
What?

28:59.555 --> 29:00.952
Turn on the pump!

29:06.625 --> 29:07.911
Hawkins!

29:11.238 --> 29:12.162
Hawkins!

29:18.646 --> 29:19.812
Come on.

29:22.525 --> 29:23.692
What the hell are you doing?

29:24.838 --> 29:26.822
Fire knocked out the power...

29:30.396 --> 29:31.763
...so I found my own.

29:47.977 --> 29:49.410
--Got it?
--Yeah.

29:53.336 --> 29:56.291
--That was quick thinking.
--Yeah,I was a pool guy,too.

30:20.336 --> 30:24.392
--Hey. How you doing,Ashlee?
--I'm okay.

30:24.395 --> 30:26.843
Minor smoke inhalation,
but she's gonna be okay.

30:31.628 --> 30:32.713
You saved her life.

30:33.886 --> 30:35.483
Are the other fires still going?

30:36.386 --> 30:37.862
The South Side's under control.

30:38.566 --> 30:40.010
The one near your house?

30:40.908 --> 30:42.823
I haven't heard. My wife...

30:46.208 --> 30:47.413
Hey,where's April?

30:58.408 --> 30:59.693
You're still here.

31:00.827 --> 31:01.920
Yeah.

31:02.985 --> 31:05.440
Did my parents...

31:05.955 --> 31:07.120
Sorry.

31:08.396 --> 31:09.760
It's charged, though.

31:12.466 --> 31:13.513
You going home now?

31:15.718 --> 31:17.401
Are you gonna stay here all night?

31:19.536 --> 31:21.452
Don't have anywhere else to go.

31:22.416 --> 31:24.360
The fire moved through the trailer park.

31:24.977 --> 31:26.173
It's all gone.

31:26.577 --> 31:28.553
Oh,Dale,I am so sorry.

31:28.557 --> 31:31.151
--It's okay.
--No,it's not.

31:31.156 --> 31:33.201
Why are you being so calm about it?

31:33.746 --> 31:37.112
--Don't have much of a choice.
--How 'bout,scream?

31:37.428 --> 31:39.961
Cry. Hit something.
Break something.

31:40.708 --> 31:41.521
Come on.

31:41.648 --> 31:43.810
--Where are you going?
--We'll start with the mayor.

31:43.815 --> 31:45.611
We'll get him to give you a place to live

31:45.618 --> 31:47.751
and some clothes and some money.

31:47.755 --> 31:50.040
I can take care of myself.
I'll be okay.

31:51.997 --> 31:53.833
I was just trying to help.

31:56.735 --> 31:59.731
I know. I know.

32:10.116 --> 32:13.682
--Here,let me help you with that.
--I got it.
--No...

32:15.447 --> 32:17.543
I told you. I'm sorry.

32:33.447 --> 32:34.730
Divorce papers?

32:44.165 --> 32:46.420
I had them drawn up before
the bombs went off.

32:46.686 --> 32:48.363
I didn't want you to see them.

32:50.067 --> 32:51.121
I don't...

32:53.818 --> 32:55.253
I don't want that anymore.

32:58.226 --> 33:01.813
The divorce,I don't want it.

33:04.246 --> 33:06.282
Well,I can't blame you,April.

33:09.408 --> 33:13.302
Things have been bad between us for a long time.

33:14.585 --> 33:16.801
Not bad. Just...

33:17.357 --> 33:18.992
Not good.

33:36.376 --> 33:37.510
Not now.

33:38.956 --> 33:41.170
Everything's changed,Eric.

33:42.606 --> 33:44.553
The world has changed.

33:46.196 --> 33:47.211
Please.

33:47.997 --> 33:49.703
We can think about this.

33:51.195 --> 33:52.283
Just...

33:54.157 --> 33:55.591
... not today.

34:15.045 --> 34:16.110
The good silver.

34:16.116 --> 34:17.213
What's the occasion?

34:17.216 --> 34:21.833
Oh,this set's been passed down
for five generations.

34:22.118 --> 34:23.210
Probably seen the light of day

34:23.217 --> 34:25.733
maybe half a dozen times since I've had it.

34:26.228 --> 34:27.243
From now on,

34:27.655 --> 34:29.840
every night's a special occasion.

34:30.375 --> 34:32.453
--Did you turn off the TV?
--Yeah.

34:32.877 --> 34:36.260
Seemed kind of silly to be staring at a blank screen

34:36.266 --> 34:39.103
waiting for God-knows-who
to tell me God-knows-what.

34:40.036 --> 34:41.780
It did get me thinking,though.

34:43.455 --> 34:44.402
You know that...

34:44.436 --> 34:46.661
that thing you've been running away from?

34:48.487 --> 34:50.042
It's not out there.

34:51.175 --> 34:52.380
He's upstairs,

34:52.697 --> 34:53.880
waiting on dinner.

35:14.818 --> 35:15.602
Hi.

35:16.375 --> 35:17.551
I'm glad you're home.

35:28.205 --> 35:29.573
Last call,folks!

35:29.576 --> 35:31.202
Closing early tonight!

35:31.207 --> 35:33.603
--What are we gonna do about this?
--Watch it at home.

35:34.497 --> 35:36.051
Or at a friend's.

35:37.855 --> 35:39.812
Last... call.

35:40.235 --> 35:42.590
--Hey,hey,look.
--Hey.

35:47.297 --> 35:50.300
--Stanley, go tell everyone.
--But I want to watch.

35:50.306 --> 35:53.060
--Then pay your tab.
--Okay,I'm going.

35:54.536 --> 35:56.122
Check it out, check it out.

36:05.866 --> 36:07.603
It's something else every day.

36:09.355 --> 36:11.141
How are we going to handle all this?

36:12.196 --> 36:13.752
Same way we did today.

36:16.326 --> 36:18.940
We lost a few buildings but no lives.

36:20.876 --> 36:24.582
And that is,in no small part, thanks to you.

36:26.246 --> 36:27.033
A lot of folks are saying

36:27.036 --> 36:29.900
how lucky Jericho is to have you back again.

36:30.735 --> 36:35.101
--And what are you telling them?
--Well,I've tried to correct them,
but nobody listens to me.

36:46.086 --> 36:50.401
You know what the hardest part
about growing up your son was?

36:51.915 --> 36:54.811
It's not the politics,
or the expectations,it's...

36:56.035 --> 36:58.423
It's that I always knew you were
a good judge of character

36:58.427 --> 37:00.203
and you thought mine was lousy.

37:04.937 --> 37:06.251
When I left town,

37:06.258 --> 37:08.692
I was determined to prove you wrong,but...

37:11.107 --> 37:12.271
but instead,everywhere I went,

37:12.278 --> 37:13.740
I seemed to prove you right.

37:18.115 --> 37:19.081
Dad...

37:20.697 --> 37:23.712
--I wasn't just in San Diego.
--I don't care.

37:26.667 --> 37:28.573
What?

37:31.537 --> 37:32.902
I don't care.

37:40.636 --> 37:43.092
If you need to tell me, I'll listen,but...

37:44.457 --> 37:47.092
wherever you went,whatever
you did,it changed you.

37:50.276 --> 37:52.731
And a stupid little punk may have left home

37:54.108 --> 37:55.902
but a pretty decent fellow came back.

37:59.348 --> 38:00.741
I can live with that.

39:06.145 --> 39:08.322
Daddy, now that the electricity is back on

39:08.327 --> 39:09.950
can we go to the movies?

39:10.055 --> 39:11.061
Of course.

39:11.418 --> 39:17.862
--And baseball games, and the aquarium,and...
--Let's just... start with a movie,okay?

39:18.325 --> 39:19.233
Okay.

39:19.236 --> 39:21.212
Why were you working outside today?

39:22.955 --> 39:24.631
Daddy had to fix something.

39:25.266 --> 39:27.131
What was in that big box?

39:28.135 --> 39:29.770
That was my tools.

39:30.335 --> 39:35.190
--Come on,Sam, it's bedtime.
--Will you come tuck me in,Dad?
--Okay.

39:36.626 --> 39:38.532
Did you fix the problem?

39:40.695 --> 39:42.212
Daddy's working on it.

39:50.118 --> 39:51.283
After all these years,

39:51.597 --> 39:53.890
wanting to have the whole family
around the table...

39:54.746 --> 39:56.101
Careful what you wish for.

39:57.757 --> 40:00.051
--It's delicious,Gail.
--Thanks.

40:00.056 --> 40:02.741
Yeah,who knew instant potatoes could taste
like anything?

40:02.745 --> 40:05.722
Well,things will get better
after we get real food.

40:08.367 --> 40:11.482
Filet mignon with bleu cheese.

40:16.908 --> 40:19.201
Don't pretend you haven't thought about it.

40:20.756 --> 40:26.211
--Cheeseburger and French fries.
--Corned beef and cabbage
with that spicy mustard.

40:28.898 --> 40:31.450
Yeah,I could go for a slice of Mom's blueberry pie.

40:31.458 --> 40:35.412
--Fried chicken with some fresh corn on the cob.
--Chocolate cake...

40:36.828 --> 40:39.081
Excuse me-- they're getting a feed at Bailey's.

40:39.305 --> 40:41.632
--Let's turn on the TV.
--No,they're the only ones picking it up.

40:41.636 --> 40:43.600
I think it's a satellite feed from D.C.

40:49.175 --> 40:51.011
You're coming,aren't you?

40:51.527 --> 40:52.923
Yeah,of course.

41:40.318 --> 41:42.142
Keep moving it; we lost the picture.

41:42.767 --> 41:43.493
What's going on?

41:43.498 --> 41:45.110
All right,everybody calm down, all right?

41:45.115 --> 41:46.782
We'll have it back in a second.

41:47.305 --> 41:53.683
