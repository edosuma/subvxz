WEBVTT

00:03.165 --> 00:04.612
ROBIN:
<i>So, the hairdresser shows up</i>

00:04.613 --> 00:06.379
at 2:00 on Sunday.

00:06.381 --> 00:07.664
Great, and while you do that,

00:07.666 --> 00:09.082
I'll check in
on the ring bear.

00:09.084 --> 00:10.883
I'm sorry.

00:10.885 --> 00:14.671
You're saying
"ring bearer," right?

00:14.673 --> 00:16.222
Ring bear.

00:16.224 --> 00:18.758
Okay, look into my eyes and say,
"I promise that I'm not bringing

00:18.760 --> 00:20.493
a dangerous wild animal
to our wedding."

00:20.495 --> 00:21.728
(chuckles)

00:22.229 --> 00:24.130
(beeping)
I...

00:24.132 --> 00:26.816
Oh, that's the shuttle

00:26.818 --> 00:28.768
with our elderly relatives
pulling up.

00:28.770 --> 00:31.303
There's nine steps between
the bus and that front door,

00:31.305 --> 00:32.989
which means we've only got
about 45 minutes

00:32.991 --> 00:34.107
until they get inside.

00:34.109 --> 00:36.209
We won't have a
moment to ourselves

00:36.211 --> 00:38.745
once those old bastards
latch onto us like leeches,

00:38.747 --> 00:40.446
but they're family
and I love them.

00:40.448 --> 00:42.648
(chuckles)
Living link to history.

00:42.650 --> 00:44.033
Oh, God.

00:44.035 --> 00:45.201
This is gonna be rough.

00:45.203 --> 00:46.502
My great-grandparents

00:46.504 --> 00:48.588
never stop bickering,
but I guess that's

00:48.590 --> 00:50.757
what happens when you've
been married for 60 years.

00:50.759 --> 00:52.608
60 years.

00:52.610 --> 00:55.011
Man, when was the last time
you think they had sex?

00:55.013 --> 00:58.664
Probably not since the
Maple Leafs won the cup.

00:58.666 --> 01:01.100
(chuckles)
1967.

01:01.102 --> 01:03.886
That's not gonna be us, right?

01:03.888 --> 01:07.807
Like, when we get married,
it's not all fighting, no sex?

01:07.809 --> 01:09.976
What? No way.

01:09.978 --> 01:12.712
It's us, R-Train and B-Nasty.

01:12.714 --> 01:15.815
That will never happen.

01:18.986 --> 01:21.054
BOTH:
We have to have sex right now.

01:21.056 --> 01:23.056
Aw.

NARRATOR: <i>Kids, as you recall,</i>
<i>Uncle Marshall</i>

01:38.473 --> 01:40.873
<i>had gotten kicked off</i>
<i>his flight home from Minnesota</i>

01:40.875 --> 01:43.393
<i>and was now high-tailing it</i>
<i>across the country</i>

01:43.395 --> 01:46.012
with another stranded traveler
<i>named Daphne.</i>

01:46.014 --> 01:47.046
How's it going, baby?

01:47.048 --> 01:48.014
Fine.

01:48.016 --> 01:49.549
Except the flames of Lucifer

01:49.551 --> 01:51.550
keep singeing our back bumper
as we drive

01:51.552 --> 01:55.054
through this hellish,
cheese-infested wasteland.

01:55.056 --> 01:57.356
Wisconsin?
Wisconsin!

01:57.358 --> 01:58.825
Packers country.

01:58.827 --> 02:00.243
But don't worry,

02:00.245 --> 02:02.895
the Eriksen men are repping
the purple and gold

02:02.897 --> 02:04.430
like two bosses.

02:05.632 --> 02:07.450
Go, Vikings!

02:07.452 --> 02:09.702
(giggles)

02:10.621 --> 02:11.804
And how are you doing, Daphne?

02:11.806 --> 02:14.257
Not bad, considering
Marshall's been spouting

02:14.259 --> 02:16.242
Vikings trivia
for the last hour.

02:16.244 --> 02:17.744
Do you know
"I don't car""

02:17.746 --> 02:19.879
led the league last year

02:19.881 --> 02:22.348
in "dumb sports stuff"?

02:22.350 --> 02:23.416
MARSHALL:
Anyways, listen,

02:23.418 --> 02:24.416
I should be back in time

02:24.418 --> 02:25.718
for the rehearsal dinner
tomorrow.

02:25.720 --> 02:27.186
Oh, the rehearsal dinner.

02:27.188 --> 02:30.139
Daphne, you should have seen
the dress I was gonna wear.

02:30.141 --> 02:32.424
Up top,
it packed the gals together

02:32.426 --> 02:35.211
like opening night
of a <i>Sex and the City</i> movie.

02:35.213 --> 02:37.847
And down south,
it made mama look like a dream

02:37.849 --> 02:40.817
Sir Mix-A-Lot would never want
to wake up from.

02:40.819 --> 02:43.719
Ooh, what happened
to that dress?

02:45.155 --> 02:47.940
(screaming)

02:47.942 --> 02:51.477
The drunks at the dry cleaners
destroyed it.

02:51.479 --> 02:53.996
(slurps loudly)

02:53.998 --> 02:55.798
Thank you, Linus.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.266
Okay, Lily, I have to go.

02:57.268 --> 02:59.919
I have to alert the villagers
that there is

02:59.921 --> 03:01.671
a Viking amongst them.

03:01.673 --> 03:03.372
Oh...

03:03.374 --> 03:05.725
(blowing horn)

03:05.727 --> 03:07.994
Marshall's driving through Wisconsin?
Yep.

03:07.996 --> 03:10.680
Ooh, is that
your toast?

03:10.682 --> 03:12.798
Uh... yeah.
Yeah, I'm just

03:12.800 --> 03:14.734
gonna wing mine.
'Cause if you get up there

03:14.736 --> 03:16.402
and speak from the heart...

03:16.404 --> 03:18.321
things good...

03:18.323 --> 03:20.106
mouth words...

03:20.108 --> 03:21.157
memory

03:21.159 --> 03:22.124
times.

03:22.126 --> 03:23.893
Can I take a peek
at your speech?

03:23.895 --> 03:25.244
Uh, no. I...

03:25.246 --> 03:29.165
"Have a drink
with my favorite students,

03:29.167 --> 03:31.984
see one last sunset
over the Hudson."

03:31.986 --> 03:33.369
Ted, your speech sucks.

03:33.371 --> 03:36.706
Well, it's no "mouth words,
memory times."

03:36.708 --> 03:40.009
But if you must know,
it's, uh... it's not a speech.

03:40.011 --> 03:41.928
What is it, then?

03:41.930 --> 03:44.881
NARRATOR: <i>A week before the wedding,</i>
<i>I realized I couldn't stay</i>

03:44.883 --> 03:46.399
<i>in New York any longer.</i>

03:46.401 --> 03:49.936
<i>So I decided to start fresh</i>
<i>in Chicago.</i>

03:49.938 --> 03:51.554
It's a list of all the things

03:51.556 --> 03:53.356
I want to do
before I leave New York.

03:53.358 --> 03:55.525
Okay, I don't know
which I hate more:

03:55.527 --> 03:57.143
the fact that you're moving away

03:57.145 --> 03:59.562
or the fact that I'm the only
one that knows about it.

03:59.564 --> 04:01.197
Why won't you tell anyone?

04:01.199 --> 04:04.483
You don't drop a bombshell like
that this close to a wedding.

04:04.485 --> 04:07.486
No, that's an excuse. You have
been avoiding Barney and Robin

04:07.488 --> 04:08.988
since the carousel.

04:08.990 --> 04:10.189
And now
on Monday,

04:10.191 --> 04:12.625
you're running away to Chicago.

04:12.627 --> 04:14.026
I'm not running away.

04:14.028 --> 04:15.528
I'm moving on.

04:15.530 --> 04:19.031
This list isn't written by
someone who's ready to move on.

04:19.033 --> 04:21.634
It's written by someone
who loves New York.

04:21.636 --> 04:25.338
I mean, "Fix graffiti
on 96th and Amsterdam"?

04:25.340 --> 04:27.557
I hated looking at it.

04:29.059 --> 04:30.259
(clicks tongue, sighs)

04:30.261 --> 04:31.978
(paint spraying)

04:34.197 --> 04:37.083
"Buy the whole bar
a round of drinks."

04:37.085 --> 04:38.034
Mm-hmm.

04:38.036 --> 04:39.268
Hey, everyone.

04:39.270 --> 04:40.686
Next round's on me!

04:40.688 --> 04:42.554
(cheering)

04:42.556 --> 04:44.690
Yeah!
(patrons chanting "Ted!")

04:44.692 --> 04:45.925
Ted?

04:47.177 --> 04:48.444
Hey, everyone.

04:48.446 --> 04:50.329
Next round's on me!

04:51.899 --> 04:52.898
Can I have a double bourbon...

04:52.900 --> 04:55.217
No doubles!

04:55.219 --> 04:58.204
"Say good-bye
to the Empire State Building."

04:58.206 --> 04:59.939
Bro.

04:59.941 --> 05:01.207
What?

05:01.209 --> 05:03.075
Sometimes I go...

05:03.077 --> 05:05.444
talk to her about life.

05:05.446 --> 05:07.213
TED:
And I just hate the thought

05:07.215 --> 05:09.515
of leaving you, Empy,

05:09.517 --> 05:12.551
but my gut tells me
my future's in Chicago.

05:12.553 --> 05:14.303
What do you think?

05:14.305 --> 05:16.005
(deep male voice):
You need to move.

05:16.007 --> 05:17.473
Oh, my God, r-really?

05:17.475 --> 05:18.891
Are-are you sure?

05:18.893 --> 05:19.976
Yeah, I'm sure.

05:19.978 --> 05:21.644
You can't just
stand there talking

05:21.646 --> 05:23.696
to a building and petting it.

05:23.698 --> 05:26.232
Wait, are you one
of those freaks

05:26.234 --> 05:28.501
who's sexually attracted
to buildings?

05:28.503 --> 05:29.986
An objectophiliac?

05:29.988 --> 05:31.988
No way.

05:31.990 --> 05:34.373
Then why do you know
what they're called?

05:34.375 --> 05:36.809
Why do you know
what they're called?

05:37.911 --> 05:39.962
(moaning)

05:39.964 --> 05:41.947
Wait. Wait, wait. You know
what would really prove

05:41.949 --> 05:43.499
we're not some old married couple?
Mmm.

05:43.501 --> 05:45.785
Doing it somewhere
we're not supposed to.

05:45.787 --> 05:47.420
(gasps)
No, not what I mean.

05:47.422 --> 05:49.305
Oh.
Like the elevator or the pool cabana.

05:49.307 --> 05:51.040
Uh, how about the roof?
Oh...

05:51.042 --> 05:52.591
(both chuckling)

05:53.393 --> 05:55.761
MAN:
Who gets married this far away?

05:55.763 --> 05:57.513
WOMAN:
And the humidity.

05:57.515 --> 05:58.981
BOTH (quietly):
They're here.

05:58.983 --> 06:01.311
What do you say we make
this bang a home game?

06:01.336 --> 06:03.319
Yes.

06:03.320 --> 06:04.353
We're locked out.

06:04.355 --> 06:05.905
I guess we could try
the back door.

06:05.907 --> 06:07.323
(gasps)
Of our suite.

06:07.325 --> 06:08.640
Oh.
There's a back door.

06:08.642 --> 06:09.608
No, I locked it.

06:09.610 --> 06:10.609
(sighs)
Okay, it's fine.

06:10.611 --> 06:11.694
We'll race down
to the front desk

06:11.696 --> 06:13.145
and get a key
before anyone notices us.

06:13.147 --> 06:14.697
(sighs)

06:14.699 --> 06:17.450
Too late. It's like we're
in a zombie movie.

06:17.452 --> 06:18.584
Seriously.

06:18.586 --> 06:19.818
They move at
a slow shuffle,

06:19.820 --> 06:21.421
they moan a lot and,
if given the chance,

06:21.422 --> 06:22.821
they chew your ear off.

06:22.823 --> 06:24.373
But they're family
and I love 'em.

06:24.375 --> 06:25.815
Their wisdom is priceless.
(chuckles)

06:27.010 --> 06:28.778
"Finally tell
my upstairs neighbor

06:28.780 --> 06:31.380
how I've been feeling
all this time."

06:31.382 --> 06:32.932
(sighing):
Yeah.

06:33.767 --> 06:36.552
Hi. Um, I live
downstairs,

06:36.554 --> 06:39.505
and, well, I've always wanted
to say this to you, but...

06:39.507 --> 06:41.090
I've never had the guts.

06:41.092 --> 06:44.143
So here goes.

06:44.145 --> 06:46.595
Are your shoes made of lead?!

06:46.597 --> 06:49.732
Because you are the loudest
upstairs neighbor in history!

06:49.734 --> 06:52.535
Oh, oh, and you suck
at the bongos! But, hey...

06:52.537 --> 06:54.403
(chuckles)
keep practicing!

06:54.405 --> 06:55.738
In the middle of the night!

06:55.740 --> 06:58.074
Before any important interview
I've ever had!

06:59.376 --> 07:02.445
"Come clean about April 26."

07:02.447 --> 07:04.997
What happened April 26?

07:04.999 --> 07:07.216
Uh...
(chuckles)

07:07.218 --> 07:09.785
Can you believe people used to
actually swim in those things?

07:09.787 --> 07:11.370
(old-timey):
"Meet me at Coney Island, see?

07:11.372 --> 07:13.923
"I'll be doing the Charleston
atop my giant-wheeled bicycle

07:13.925 --> 07:16.475
in an era where folks
inexplicably talked like this."

07:16.477 --> 07:19.595
(chuckles)

07:19.597 --> 07:21.614
Ted.

07:23.183 --> 07:25.267
Whoa.
(chuckles) Hey.

07:25.269 --> 07:27.269
Hey, bud, I was just
about to take, uh,

07:27.271 --> 07:29.321
Lily's rehearsal dinner dress
to the dry cleaner.

07:29.323 --> 07:30.573
Oh, that's too bad.

07:30.575 --> 07:33.109
Because, uh, I was just watching
<i>The Princess Bride</i>

07:33.111 --> 07:34.893
when something occurred to me.

07:34.895 --> 07:37.663
How, at the end, Andre the Giant
hooks 'em up with those horses

07:37.665 --> 07:38.948
and then Inigo Montoya is like,

07:38.950 --> 07:42.585
"Fezzik, you did something
right." And it's like,

07:42.587 --> 07:46.172
"Bro, Andre's been doing
stuff right the whole movie:

07:46.174 --> 07:48.924
"knocking out serpents,
busting down castle doors,

07:48.926 --> 07:51.544
"basically carrying your
revenge-and-sangria-soaked ass,

07:51.546 --> 07:53.879
"so instead of being
a patronizing jerk,

07:53.881 --> 07:55.514
"how about a simple,

07:55.516 --> 07:58.584
'Hey, thanks
for the horses, bro.'"

07:58.586 --> 08:00.803
That's totally
what you were thinking, right?

08:00.805 --> 08:03.722
No, I... No, I came over...

08:03.724 --> 08:05.858
God, that's a really good point.

08:05.860 --> 08:07.042
Yeah.

08:07.044 --> 08:09.662
But here's my point.

08:09.664 --> 08:11.197
And your point.

08:11.199 --> 08:14.967
(chuckles) Why haven't we done this
in forever?

08:14.969 --> 08:17.603
Ted, you know damn well
why we haven't.

08:17.605 --> 08:21.157
(both grunting)

08:22.159 --> 08:23.159
(shouts)

08:23.161 --> 08:24.877
(Ted and Lily scream)

08:24.879 --> 08:26.212
Sorry, Lily.
Sorry, Lily.

08:26.214 --> 08:28.047
I almost killed my wife, Ted!

08:28.682 --> 08:30.449
I almost killed my wife!

08:30.451 --> 08:31.750
I almost...

08:31.752 --> 08:33.719
(both grunting)

08:33.721 --> 08:36.005
Yah!

08:36.006 --> 08:36.972
"Hello!

08:36.974 --> 08:38.340
My name is Inigo Montoya!"

08:38.342 --> 08:39.725
"You killed my father."

08:39.727 --> 08:41.710
"Prepare to die!"
"Prepare to die""

08:41.712 --> 08:44.513
(both grunting)

08:48.652 --> 08:50.436
TED:
Whoa.

08:50.438 --> 08:53.072
You son of a bitch.

08:56.332 --> 08:59.357
I loved that dress
you cut in half.

08:59.369 --> 09:04.422
It was the perfect combination
of slutty and classy.

09:04.424 --> 09:05.790
Well, what about
your backup dress?

09:05.792 --> 09:08.626
Oh, it's just classy, Ted!

09:08.628 --> 09:09.944
(slurps)

09:09.946 --> 09:12.496
Thank you, Linus.

09:12.498 --> 09:13.848
Look, I'm really sorry.

09:13.850 --> 09:15.082
No, it's not good enough.

09:15.084 --> 09:16.300
Since I'm being

09:16.302 --> 09:18.769
forced to wear something
I don't want to,

09:18.771 --> 09:22.506
you should have to wear
something you don't

09:22.508 --> 09:24.442
want to.

09:27.713 --> 09:30.114
Why am I the only one
being punished?

09:30.116 --> 09:32.033
Marshall's just as responsible
for your dress as I am.

09:32.035 --> 09:33.034
Yeah, but he's

09:33.036 --> 09:34.268
in the middle of Wisconsin.

09:34.270 --> 09:36.904
How am I gonna punish...

09:36.906 --> 09:38.906
DAPHNE:
Say cheese!

09:40.242 --> 09:42.443
Go, Pack, go!

09:46.581 --> 09:48.716
(quietly):
I'm sorry, Dad.

09:48.718 --> 09:50.842
There's got to be someplace
to bang around here.

09:50.867 --> 09:51.286
I'm starving.

09:51.287 --> 09:52.470
I knew we should've hit
the buffet when...

09:52.472 --> 09:54.638
(grunts)
Don't say "buffet".

09:54.640 --> 09:56.590
That attracts old people.
Same goes for "coupon,"

09:56.592 --> 09:58.759
<i>"60"</i> <i>"Minutes"</i>
and "Mandy Patinkin."

09:58.761 --> 10:00.978
W... Robin,
you're being paranoid.

10:00.980 --> 10:02.963
Old people don't magically
sense it

10:02.965 --> 10:05.466
when you say "Mandy Patinkin."

10:05.468 --> 10:08.819
(echoing whisper):
Patinkin...

10:08.821 --> 10:10.071
Quick, the ice machine room.

10:10.073 --> 10:12.106
It's too cold for them in there.
Oh.

10:15.744 --> 10:17.445
I'll protect you, Robin.

10:17.447 --> 10:19.914
You'll always be safe with me.

10:20.532 --> 10:22.816
(screams)
Take her!

10:24.152 --> 10:26.620
You bitches best get out
of my hiding spot.

10:26.622 --> 10:29.423
The only thing not checked off
on this list is

10:29.425 --> 10:32.593
"scotch with Barney."
That's the easiest one on here.

10:32.595 --> 10:34.929
You <i>are</i> avoiding him.

10:34.931 --> 10:36.881
I'm not. We've both been busy.

10:36.883 --> 10:39.400
Besides, Marshall and I
are saving that scotch

10:39.402 --> 10:41.402
to have a drink with Barney
before the rehearsal dinner.

10:41.404 --> 10:44.855
Because it's not just
any bottle.

10:44.857 --> 10:48.225
It's a $600
Glen McKenna 30-year.

10:48.227 --> 10:51.395
NARRATOR: <i>What I didn't know</i>
<i>at the time was...</i>

10:51.397 --> 10:56.150
I told those idiots these
death rods are not welcome here.

10:56.152 --> 10:59.403
What is it with
dudes and swords?

10:59.405 --> 11:01.355
Oh, this is fun.

11:01.357 --> 11:04.742
Oh, yeah, and it's so cool
when I go like this.

11:09.464 --> 11:11.749
Hi. My name is Rodrigo DeGoya.

11:11.751 --> 11:12.883
You killed someone I love!

11:12.885 --> 11:14.668
Prepare to dance!

11:14.670 --> 11:18.705
NARRATOR: <i>Yes, kids, that's what your</i>
<i>Aunt Lily thought the line was.</i>

11:18.707 --> 11:19.723
(growls)

11:19.725 --> 11:21.592
Ha! Whoo!

11:21.594 --> 11:23.727
(both grunting)

11:23.729 --> 11:26.097
Ha!

11:26.099 --> 11:27.815
(both gasp)

11:27.817 --> 11:30.668
We'll switch it with this
cheap bottle of whiskey.

11:30.670 --> 11:32.420
You peel the label
off the Glen McKenna.

11:32.422 --> 11:33.521
On it!

11:33.523 --> 11:35.489
Then we'll pour the... Robin!

11:35.491 --> 11:36.974
Damn, that's smooth.

11:36.976 --> 11:39.660
Pour it into
the other bottle!

11:44.032 --> 11:46.867
Wait. The color's
not dark enough.

11:53.241 --> 11:54.241
Still not right.

11:54.243 --> 11:56.377
I think it was a little redder.
Mm-hmm.

12:02.417 --> 12:04.435
Okay, now
the consistency's off.

12:06.721 --> 12:08.772
(sighs)

12:08.774 --> 12:10.774
Yeah.

12:10.776 --> 12:12.693
Looks good.

12:12.695 --> 12:15.312
I mean, look at the color.

12:15.314 --> 12:18.199
It's almost
chocolaty in its richness.

12:19.100 --> 12:20.451
The reddish hue.

12:21.319 --> 12:23.704
Something that looks
sort of clumpy.

12:23.706 --> 12:25.156
Oh, yeah, I-I read about that.

12:25.158 --> 12:30.077
Isn't the Highland region
known for its clumps?

12:30.079 --> 12:31.996
Thanks, Lily.

12:31.998 --> 12:35.115
I'm very aware
of the Highland Clumps.

12:35.117 --> 12:37.384
You know what?
I think I'm gonna sneak a taste.

12:37.386 --> 12:40.721
What? But-but Marshall's
not even here yet!

12:40.723 --> 12:43.891
Ah, a quick nip won't hurt.

12:46.545 --> 12:49.096
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho!

12:49.098 --> 12:51.315
(sniffs)

12:53.000 --> 12:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:03.144 --> 13:04.862
She's breathtaking.

13:05.997 --> 13:07.364
You avoiding
the family, too?

13:07.366 --> 13:11.252
I'm gay, I'm black,
and I'm getting a divorce.

13:11.254 --> 13:13.654
Those walking skeletons are
gonna have more questions for me

13:13.656 --> 13:15.673
than their pharmacist.
(chuckles)

13:15.675 --> 13:17.725
But they're family
and I love 'em.

13:17.727 --> 13:19.009
The greatest generation.

13:19.011 --> 13:20.995
Smother me before
I'm that age. (laughs)

13:20.997 --> 13:22.213
What are you two doing?

13:22.215 --> 13:23.347
Oh, we're trying
to do it

13:23.349 --> 13:25.065
someplace naughty.
(gasps)

13:25.067 --> 13:25.999
Not what I mean!

13:26.001 --> 13:27.434
That-that is never
what I mean!

13:27.436 --> 13:28.469
(sighs)

13:28.471 --> 13:30.387
We're trying to sneak in
one last bang

13:30.389 --> 13:32.439
'cause we're afraid
that the magic

13:32.441 --> 13:34.725
might fade
after we get married.

13:34.727 --> 13:36.060
Are we being crazy?

13:36.062 --> 13:38.479
That is what happened
with me and Tom.

13:39.981 --> 13:42.366
But it doesn't mean
it's gonna happen to you.

13:42.368 --> 13:43.400
I won't let it.

13:43.402 --> 13:46.036
Whoa-whoa, you can't
go out there.

13:46.038 --> 13:47.371
It's suicide.

13:47.373 --> 13:49.623
Consider it
your early wedding gift.

13:54.162 --> 13:56.697
Why does the brother
always die first?

13:58.216 --> 13:59.967
Aunt Muriel!

14:07.392 --> 14:09.476
Aunt Muriel!

14:11.596 --> 14:12.563
Aunt Muriel?

14:12.565 --> 14:13.597
James!

14:13.599 --> 14:14.565
Where's Tom?

14:14.567 --> 14:16.100
I have a gay question for you.

14:16.102 --> 14:19.520
How do you decide
which one...?

14:19.522 --> 14:20.721
No, no...

14:20.723 --> 14:22.889
No!
He's gone, Barney. He's gone.

14:22.891 --> 14:24.074
James!

14:27.495 --> 14:28.929
Okay, you go check out

14:28.931 --> 14:30.564
the second floor
for open rooms.

14:30.566 --> 14:32.249
I'm gonna go
check out the gym.

14:32.251 --> 14:34.001
No, no, no, that
gym has a sauna!

14:34.003 --> 14:36.754
You know my Papa Sid can't go
ten minutes without a schvitz!

14:36.756 --> 14:37.888
What about the
gazebo out back?

14:37.890 --> 14:39.206
Next to the lawn bowling court?

14:39.208 --> 14:40.624
Get your head out of your ass.

14:40.626 --> 14:42.676
It looks like they're casting
<i>Cocoon Three</i> out there.

14:42.678 --> 14:44.378
Oh, what about
the business center?

14:44.380 --> 14:46.580
A room full of computers?
That's perfect.

14:46.582 --> 14:47.892
Technology is their

14:47.917 --> 14:50.250
compression-sock-covered
Achilles Heel!

14:51.252 --> 14:52.936
Whoa.
What?

14:52.938 --> 14:54.972
Stay safe, R-Train.
You too, B-Nasty.

14:54.974 --> 14:56.106
Mmm...
Mmm...

14:56.108 --> 14:57.274
Ah!

14:58.310 --> 15:00.427
Ooh, my, I found Waldo.

15:00.429 --> 15:02.062
(laughs)

15:03.548 --> 15:05.382
What's this list?

15:09.512 --> 15:10.713
Whose is this?

15:11.876 --> 15:13.761
NARRATOR:
I was faced with a tough call:

15:13.762 --> 15:15.128
<i>come clean about Chicago</i>

15:15.130 --> 15:17.663
<i>or cleverly lie my way</i>
<i>out of it.</i>

15:17.665 --> 15:21.267
Oh, well, you see...

15:21.269 --> 15:22.735
mouth words...

15:22.737 --> 15:23.770
memory times...

15:23.772 --> 15:25.705
It's mine. It's my list.

15:25.707 --> 15:28.591
It's everything I want to do
before I go to Italy.

15:28.593 --> 15:31.994
Oh. You want to say good-bye
to the Empire State Building?

15:33.180 --> 15:36.265
Sometimes I go
and I talk to Empy.

15:36.267 --> 15:37.250
That's kind of weird.

15:37.252 --> 15:38.667
Is "weird" the right word?

15:38.669 --> 15:40.336
Seems pretty
reasonable to me.

15:40.338 --> 15:42.555
Maybe even kind of cool.

15:42.557 --> 15:45.024
"Have a drink
with my favorite students."

15:45.026 --> 15:46.843
Lily, you taught kindergarten.

15:46.845 --> 15:49.395
That does seem
pretty irresponsible.

15:49.397 --> 15:52.148
"Come clean about April 26."

15:52.150 --> 15:54.300
You told Ted
about our sword fight?

15:54.302 --> 15:56.035
Wait-- you-you guys
had a sword fight?

15:56.037 --> 15:57.103
Maybe a tiny one.

15:57.105 --> 15:59.572
I was pretending
to be Mandy Patinkin.

15:59.574 --> 16:02.191
(echoing whisper):
Patinkin.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.033
But it was no big deal.

16:11.035 --> 16:12.335
No big deal?

16:12.337 --> 16:14.537
We destroyed
their 30-year Glen McKenna

16:14.539 --> 16:16.806
and replaced it with cheap
booze, ketchup and hand sanny.

16:16.808 --> 16:17.807
I knew it!

16:17.809 --> 16:18.808
You knew nothing!

16:18.810 --> 16:19.892
(phone rings)

16:19.894 --> 16:21.828
Hello.

16:21.830 --> 16:24.430
The third floor's a ghost town,
tons of empty rooms to bang in.

16:24.432 --> 16:25.731
Hurry. I've started without you.

16:25.733 --> 16:27.400
I mean, I love you.

16:27.402 --> 16:28.367
Got to go.

16:28.369 --> 16:30.186
Bye.

16:31.572 --> 16:32.555
(sighs)

16:32.557 --> 16:33.556
We made it.

16:33.558 --> 16:34.557
(both laugh)

16:34.559 --> 16:36.359
(both moaning)

16:36.361 --> 16:38.327
MURIEL:
Remind me to put

16:38.329 --> 16:41.781
a five-dollar bill in
Barney's wedding card,

16:41.783 --> 16:44.033
you know,
to get 'em started.

16:45.202 --> 16:47.537
(giggles)

16:47.539 --> 16:48.737
(chuckles)

16:48.739 --> 16:50.289
MAN:
No, Elizabeth.

16:50.291 --> 16:52.575
Leave the dentures in.

16:52.577 --> 16:54.177
WOMAN:
Mmm!

16:55.546 --> 16:57.580
BOTH:
I never want to have sex again.

16:57.582 --> 16:59.432
Aw.

16:59.434 --> 17:01.133
(groans)

17:01.135 --> 17:04.053
They broke our $600
bottle of scotch?

17:04.055 --> 17:07.190
Well, I'm not wearing
this abomination anymore.

17:09.276 --> 17:11.460
Put it back on.

17:20.153 --> 17:23.656
I can't believe my great-
grandparents still do that.

17:23.657 --> 17:25.208
I never imagined
a walker being used

17:25.210 --> 17:27.542
for anything
other than walking.

17:27.545 --> 17:30.296
Plus, how about those balls
dragging all over the ground?

17:30.298 --> 17:31.447
Barney.

17:31.449 --> 17:34.783
No, the tennis balls
on the bottom of the walker.

17:34.785 --> 17:36.419
Oh.

17:36.421 --> 17:40.673
Plus, his testicles were
swinging like a broken yo-yo.

17:40.675 --> 17:42.925
Still, when you
think about it:

17:42.927 --> 17:44.310
married for 60 years

17:44.312 --> 17:46.145
and they still want to
jump each other's bones.

17:46.147 --> 17:50.566
I mean... it's
kind of sweet.

17:50.568 --> 17:53.469
In 60 years,
that'll be us, right?

17:53.471 --> 17:56.489
Yeah, it will.

17:57.324 --> 17:59.659
(both chuckle)

17:59.661 --> 18:01.661
So, what do you think, hmm?

18:01.663 --> 18:03.329
On the count of three?

18:03.331 --> 18:04.497
Hmm, okay.

18:04.499 --> 18:05.865
Okay.

18:05.867 --> 18:09.085
BOTH:
One, two, three.

18:09.087 --> 18:11.254
Mandy Patinkin.

18:13.290 --> 18:15.041
Oh, wow.
Look at you.

18:15.043 --> 18:16.642
Thank you for
making it...

18:16.644 --> 18:18.511
We got lucky.

18:18.513 --> 18:22.298
The Farhampton Liquor Store
is actually pretty high-end.

18:22.300 --> 18:22.872
Oh.

18:22.897 --> 18:25.289
And their security
is a total joke.

18:27.721 --> 18:29.305
Thanks.

18:30.340 --> 18:33.609
And thanks for not telling Robin
the list was mine.

18:34.511 --> 18:35.645
But I don't get it.

18:35.647 --> 18:36.979
You're so against me moving.

18:36.981 --> 18:38.464
Why'd you help me out?

18:38.466 --> 18:39.482
(sighs)

18:39.484 --> 18:43.202
For a guy who loves New York
this much,

18:43.204 --> 18:48.207
to leave it,
you must really need to go, huh?

18:48.209 --> 18:51.577
Yeah, I really do.

18:51.579 --> 18:55.998
Okay, but there's still
one item left on this list.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.249
Time to check it off.

18:57.251 --> 18:58.467
Yeah, I should
probably wait

18:58.469 --> 18:59.769
for Marshall.

18:59.771 --> 19:03.005
Well, we both know
he may not get here in time.

19:04.007 --> 19:06.592
Be honest.

19:06.594 --> 19:08.794
Have you been avoiding Barney?

19:10.180 --> 19:12.081
Maybe a little.

19:12.083 --> 19:15.751
This is the biggest weekend
of his life,

19:15.753 --> 19:17.536
and you're his best bro.

19:18.238 --> 19:20.573
No matter how awkward you feel,

19:20.575 --> 19:25.728
i-if you're not there for him,
you will always regret it.

19:28.398 --> 19:30.032
Okay.

19:30.034 --> 19:32.101
Hey, Ted.
Yeah.

19:33.170 --> 19:37.106
You wrote down all these things
to say good-bye to,

19:37.108 --> 19:40.426
but so many of them
are good things.

19:41.278 --> 19:42.628
Why not just...

19:42.630 --> 19:44.930
say good-bye
to the bad things?

19:45.966 --> 19:49.418
<i>Say good-bye to all the times</i>
<i>you felt lost.</i>

19:50.420 --> 19:51.987
<i>To all the times</i>

19:51.989 --> 19:55.257
<i>it was a no instead of a yes.</i>

19:56.560 --> 20:00.029
To all the scrapes and bruises,

20:00.031 --> 20:01.814
<i>to all the heartache.</i>

20:01.816 --> 20:05.034
<i>Say good-bye to everything</i>
<i>you really want</i>

20:05.036 --> 20:07.853
<i>to do for the last time,</i>

20:07.855 --> 20:11.540
but don't go have
one last scotch with Barney.

20:11.542 --> 20:15.628
Have the first scotch
toasting Barney's new life

20:15.630 --> 20:16.679
because that's
a good thing,

20:16.681 --> 20:18.831
and the good things

20:18.833 --> 20:21.634
will always be here
waiting for you.

20:23.670 --> 20:24.820
What?

20:24.822 --> 20:27.289
Turn the page.

20:29.976 --> 20:33.345
"Get one last life lecture
from Lily."

20:33.947 --> 20:35.130
Well, you're dreaming

20:35.132 --> 20:37.316
if you think
that's the last one of those.

20:39.186 --> 20:41.353
(sighs)

20:52.115 --> 20:53.716
Ah.

20:53.718 --> 20:55.668
Been waiting for the
perfect time for this,

20:55.670 --> 20:57.169
and, my friend,
that time is...

20:57.171 --> 20:58.871
I saw you and Robin
at the carousel.
