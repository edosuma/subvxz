00:34.767 --> 00:35.567
WELCOME, WELCOME

00:35.567 --> 00:37.166
TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT."

00:37.166 --> 00:37.767
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:37.767 --> 00:38.266
THANK YOU SO MUCH

00:38.266 --> 00:39.433
FOR JOINING US.

00:39.433 --> 00:41.567
AND WE BARELY HAVE TIME FOR EVEN

00:41.567 --> 00:42.767
A LIGHTNING-QUICK RECAP OF THE

00:42.767 --> 00:43.734
WEEK, WHICH SAW EVERYTHING

00:43.734 --> 00:44.767
FROM REPUBLICANS CONTINUING

00:44.767 --> 00:46.100
TO ROLL OUT THEIR TAX REFORM

00:50.400 --> 00:52.033
REPORTING LOUIS CK'S GROSS

00:52.033 --> 00:53.567
SEXUAL MISCONDUCT,

00:53.567 --> 00:54.900
CONDUCT WHICH IS COMPLETELY

00:54.900 --> 00:56.367
INDEFENSIBLE AND WHICH

00:56.367 --> 00:58.367
INEVITABLY RESULTED IN THE

00:58.367 --> 00:59.633
CANCELLATION OF HIS NEW FILM,

00:59.633 --> 01:00.133
"EXHIBIT A IF THIS EVER

01:00.133 --> 01:02.533
GOES TO TRIAL."

01:02.533 --> 01:04.333
AS FOR THE PRESIDENT, HE'S BEEN

01:04.333 --> 01:05.433
OVERSEAS ALL WEEK, WHICH

01:05.433 --> 01:06.533
SHOULD'VE BEEN RELAXING FOR THE

01:06.533 --> 01:09.367
REST OF US, UNTIL THIS HAPPENED

01:09.367 --> 01:11.333
LAST NIGHT.

01:11.333 --> 01:12.266
>> MOMENTS AGO, PRESIDENT TRUMP

01:12.266 --> 01:13.033
OPENLY MOCKED THE LEADER OF

01:13.033 --> 01:15.133
NORTH KOREA.

01:15.133 --> 01:17.166
HE WROTE "WHY WOULD KIM JONG UN

01:17.166 --> 01:18.200
INSULT ME BY CALLING ME OLD

01:18.200 --> 01:18.967
WHEN I WOULD NEVER CALL HIM

01:18.967 --> 01:22.633
SHORT AND FAT?"

01:22.633 --> 01:23.967
>> John: THIS WOULD BE THE

01:23.967 --> 01:27.834
STUPIDEST POSSIBLE REASON

01:27.834 --> 01:28.767
FOR ALL OF US TO DIE.

01:28.767 --> 01:29.233
I'M SERIOUS.

01:29.233 --> 01:30.100
IF THE ENTIRE COUNTRY

01:30.100 --> 01:30.767
SIMULTANEOUSLY TRIPPED WHILE

01:30.767 --> 01:32.734
PUTTING ON ITS UNDERWEAR,

01:32.734 --> 01:33.667
AND FELL FACE-FORWARD INTO THE

01:33.667 --> 01:35.000
TOILET, GOT STUCK AND DROWNED,

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
IT WOULD BE CONSIDERABLY LESS

01:37.000 --> 01:37.900
STUPID THAN IF THIS TWEET

01:37.900 --> 01:40.467
CAUSED A NUCLEAR APOCALYPSE.

01:40.467 --> 01:41.734
BUT RATHER THAN FOCUS ON THE

01:41.734 --> 01:42.934
EVENTS OF THIS WEEK, AS THIS IS

01:42.934 --> 01:44.333
OUR LAST SHOW OF THE SEASON,

01:44.333 --> 01:46.100
WE THOUGHT WE'D ACTUALLY TAKE

01:46.100 --> 01:47.500
A BROADER LOOK AT THE TOPIC THAT

01:47.500 --> 01:49.300
HAS DOMINATED THE PAST YEAR:

01:49.300 --> 01:51.300
THE PRESIDENCY OF DONALD TRUMP.

01:51.300 --> 01:52.667
THE MAN VOTED "LEAST EDIBLE"

01:52.667 --> 01:54.133
BY CANNIBAL MAGAZINE SIX YEARS

01:54.133 --> 01:57.800
IN ROW.

01:57.800 --> 01:59.233
AND I KNOW THE PROSPECT

01:59.233 --> 02:00.567
OF TALKING ABOUT TRUMP YET AGAIN

02:00.567 --> 02:02.133
FEELS EXHAUSTING.

02:02.133 --> 02:03.400
WE'RE ALL SO TIRED OF HIM.

02:03.400 --> 02:04.700
EVERY ROOM IN AMERICA SHOULD

02:04.700 --> 02:05.834
HAVE A SIGN ON THE WALL THAT

02:05.834 --> 02:07.166
COUNTS THE NUMBER OF MINUTES

02:07.166 --> 02:13.033
IT'S BEEN SINCE SOMEONE

02:13.033 --> 02:14.266
BROUGHT UP HIS FUCKING NAME.

02:14.266 --> 02:15.367
BUT THAT'S THE THING.

02:15.367 --> 02:16.233
TRUMP'S PRESIDENCY IS LIKE

02:16.233 --> 02:17.033
ONE OF HIS HANDSHAKES.

02:17.033 --> 02:18.000
IT PULLS YOU IN WHETHER YOU

02:18.000 --> 02:19.033
LIKE IT OR NOT.

02:19.033 --> 02:20.333
HE'S HAD SO MANY TERRIBLE

02:20.333 --> 02:23.000
MOMENTS THIS YEAR, YOU FORGET

02:23.000 --> 02:24.033
ABOUT SOME OF THEM.

02:24.033 --> 02:25.033
REMEMBER WHEN HE CREEPILY TOLD

02:25.033 --> 02:26.000
THE FRENCH PRESIDENT'S

02:26.000 --> 02:28.033
WIFE SHE WAS IN GOOD SHAPE?

02:28.033 --> 02:29.533
OR WHEN HIS TACKY GOLF RESORT

02:29.533 --> 02:30.300
WAS TOUTED ON THE STATE

02:30.300 --> 02:32.333
DEPARTMENT WEBSITE?

02:32.333 --> 02:33.600
OR WHEN HE SHOVED THE PRIME

02:33.600 --> 02:34.500
MINISTER OF MONTENEGRO OUT OF

02:34.500 --> 02:41.100
THE WAY AT A NATO EVENT?

02:41.100 --> 02:42.467
LOOK HOW PROUD OF HIMSELF HE IS!

02:42.467 --> 02:43.567
YOU SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE TO KNOW

02:43.567 --> 02:44.834
THAT MONTENEGRO IS A COUNTRY

02:44.834 --> 02:45.700
BEFORE MAKING A MOVE THAT SAYS,

02:45.700 --> 02:48.100
"SUCK IT, MONTENEGRO!"

02:48.100 --> 02:49.266
AND THERE WERE ALSO QUIETER

02:49.266 --> 02:50.567
BUT NO LESS ALARMING MOMENTS,

02:50.567 --> 02:51.900
LIKE WHEN HE EXPLAINED HOW HARD

02:51.900 --> 02:53.533
HE'S BEEN FIGHTING TO BRING

02:53.533 --> 02:54.567
"CLEAN COAL" BACK WITHOUT

02:54.567 --> 02:55.734
APPEARING TO UNDERSTAND

02:55.734 --> 03:02.567
WHAT THAT ACTUALLY IS.

03:02.567 --> 03:03.934
>> IT'S JUST BEEN ANNOUNCED

03:03.934 --> 03:04.900
THAT A SECOND, BRAND-NEW COAL

03:04.900 --> 03:06.066
MINE WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE

03:06.066 --> 03:06.700
OUT CLEAN COAL, MEANING THEY ARE

03:06.700 --> 03:07.967
TAKING OUT COAL.

03:07.967 --> 03:09.433
THEY ARE GONNA CLEAN IT.

03:09.433 --> 03:09.967
IS OPENING IN THE STATE

03:09.967 --> 03:12.333
OF PENNSYLVANIA.

03:12.333 --> 03:14.367
>> John: LISTEN.

03:14.367 --> 03:16.300
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT DONALD TRUMP

03:16.300 --> 03:17.934
IS WELL-VERSED IN AND IS

03:17.934 --> 03:19.333
REFERRING TO FLUE-GAS

03:19.333 --> 03:20.633
DESULFURIZATION, FLUIDIZED-BED

03:20.633 --> 03:21.467
COMBUSTION, AND SELECTIVE

03:21.467 --> 03:22.200
CATALYTIC REDUCTION?

03:22.200 --> 03:26.633
SURE.

03:26.633 --> 03:27.567
IT'S POSSIBLE.

03:27.567 --> 03:28.734
BUT LET'S AGREE IT'S

03:28.734 --> 03:29.400
CONSIDERABLY MORE LIKELY THAT HE

03:29.400 --> 03:30.033
THINKS YOU JUST TAKE A BUNCH OF

03:30.033 --> 03:30.800
COAL AND SCRUB-A-DUB-DUB IT

03:30.800 --> 03:31.900
WITH A BIG OLD SPONGE.

03:31.900 --> 03:33.033
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

03:33.033 --> 03:34.000
I'M SAYING THE PRESIDENT

03:34.000 --> 03:35.600
FUNDAMENTALLY DOESN'T UNDERSTAND

03:35.600 --> 03:36.200
WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT.

03:36.200 --> 03:37.333
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?

03:37.333 --> 03:38.867
WE GOT HIM!

03:38.867 --> 03:40.333
WE GOT HIM!

03:40.333 --> 03:46.000
WE GOT HIM!

03:46.000 --> 03:50.266
I DIDN'T GET HIM?

03:50.266 --> 03:52.567
I THOUGHT WE GOT HIM.

03:52.567 --> 03:53.166
YOU DON'T THINK I HATE MYSELF

03:53.166 --> 03:54.867
TOO?

03:54.867 --> 03:57.100
ALL RIGHT.

03:57.100 --> 03:59.734
THE POINT IS, TONIGHT,

03:59.734 --> 04:01.333
LET'S PULL BACK FROM THE DAILY

04:01.333 --> 04:02.633
TRUMP-INDUCED CHAOS AND TAKE

04:02.633 --> 04:04.533
A LOOK AT THE NORMS

04:04.533 --> 04:06.066
HIS PRESIDENCY HAS VIOLATED.

04:06.066 --> 04:07.467
AND NOT THE OBVIOUS ONES, LIKE

04:07.467 --> 04:09.000
THE FACT HE NEVER RELEASED HIS

04:09.000 --> 04:09.967
TAX RETURNS OR THAT HIS OWN

04:09.967 --> 04:11.867
DAUGHTER AND SON-IN-LAW WORK

04:11.867 --> 04:12.867
IN THE WHITE HOUSE, ALTHOUGH

04:12.867 --> 04:14.667
ADMITTEDLY, I AM USING THE WORD

04:14.667 --> 04:16.400
"WORK" SO GENEROUSLY THAT I

04:16.400 --> 04:17.934
SHOULD BE ABLE TO DEDUCT IT AS A

04:17.934 --> 04:20.066
CHARITABLE DONATION ON MY TAXES.

04:20.066 --> 04:21.467
OR THAT INSTEAD OF PUTTING HIS

04:21.467 --> 04:22.200
ASSETS INTO A BLIND TRUST

04:22.200 --> 04:23.333
TO HELP REDUCE CONFLICTS OF

04:23.333 --> 04:24.867
INTEREST, HE SIMPLY SHOWED

04:24.867 --> 04:26.433
AMERICA THAT HE HAS MANY LARGE

04:26.433 --> 04:28.133
STACKS OF PAPER PRESUMABLY

04:28.133 --> 04:29.533
CONTAINING THE SENTENCE

04:29.533 --> 04:30.367
"I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M GETTING

04:30.367 --> 04:31.867
AWAY WITH THIS"

04:31.867 --> 04:35.567
PRINTED 750,000 TIMES.

04:35.567 --> 04:36.767
NO, INSTEAD, WE'RE GOING TO TALK

04:36.767 --> 04:37.467
ABOUT TRUMP'S ASSAULT ON

04:37.467 --> 04:38.900
SOMETHING EVEN MORE BASIC.

04:38.900 --> 04:40.467
THE NORMS GOVERNING HOW OUR

04:40.467 --> 04:42.033
LEADERS ENGAGE WITH US AND HOW

04:42.033 --> 04:44.867
IN TURN THAT AFFECTS THE WAY

04:44.867 --> 04:46.200
THAT WE ENGAGE WITH ONE ANOTHER.

04:46.200 --> 04:47.333
IT'S WHY EVEN THE NOTION OF

04:47.333 --> 04:48.333
"GETTING HIM" CAN FEEL

04:48.333 --> 04:50.533
SO HOPELESSLY FUTILE.

04:50.533 --> 04:51.867
AND LET'S FIRST STIPULATE IT

04:51.867 --> 04:52.600
DEFINITELY DOESN'T HELP THAT,

04:52.600 --> 04:54.166
SO OFTEN, WHAT TRUMP SAYS

04:54.166 --> 04:56.166
IS COMPLETE NONSENSE.

04:56.166 --> 04:58.166
WE OFTEN READ TRANSCRIPTS OF

04:58.166 --> 04:59.333
TRUMP'S SPEECHES, AND IT'S

04:59.333 --> 05:00.567
SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE SHOULD

05:00.567 --> 05:01.800
ACTUALLY DO ONCE IN A WHILE.

05:01.800 --> 05:03.500
BECAUSE WHEN YOU STRIP AWAY HIS

05:03.500 --> 05:05.300
BLINDLY CONFIDENT, ENTERTAINING

05:05.300 --> 05:06.700
DELIVERY AND JUST READ HIS

05:06.700 --> 05:09.100
WORDS, IT IS STAGGERING HOW

05:09.100 --> 05:10.800
INCOHERENT HE IS.

05:10.800 --> 05:12.166
HERE'S A WORD-FOR-WORD READING

05:12.166 --> 05:13.333
OF A SPEECH WHERE HE TALKED

05:13.333 --> 05:15.633
ABOUT THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL.

05:15.633 --> 05:17.200
>> YOU LOOK AT THE NUCLEAR DEAL,

05:17.200 --> 05:18.200
THE THING THAT REALLY

05:18.200 --> 05:19.000
BOTHERS ME --

05:19.000 --> 05:19.567
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO EASY,

05:19.567 --> 05:20.567
AND IT'S NOT AS IMPORTANT

05:20.567 --> 05:21.233
AS THESE LIVES ARE.

05:21.233 --> 05:22.834
NUCLEAR IS SO POWERFUL.

05:22.834 --> 05:23.834
MY UNCLE EXPLAINED THAT TO ME

05:23.834 --> 05:25.767
MANY, MANY YEARS AGO, THE POWER

05:25.767 --> 05:26.800
AND THAT WAS 35 YEARS AGO.

05:26.800 --> 05:28.133
HE WOULD EXPLAIN THE POWER OF

05:28.133 --> 05:29.500
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND HE

05:29.500 --> 05:30.033
WAS RIGHT, WHO WOULD HAVE

05:30.033 --> 05:30.533
THOUGHT?

05:30.533 --> 05:31.500
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S

05:31.500 --> 05:33.567
GOING ON WITH THE FOUR

05:33.567 --> 05:34.133
PRISONERS,

05:34.133 --> 05:34.934
NOW IT USED TO BE THREE,

05:34.934 --> 05:35.834
NOW IT'S FOUR.

05:35.834 --> 05:36.867
BUT WHEN IT WAS THREE AND EVEN

05:36.867 --> 05:37.500
NOW, I WOULD HAVE SAID IT'S ALL

05:37.500 --> 05:38.467
IN THE MESSENGER.

05:38.467 --> 05:39.500
FELLAS, AND IT IS FELLAS

05:39.500 --> 05:40.867
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THEY DON'T,

05:40.867 --> 05:42.033
THEY HAVEN'T FIGURED THAT THE

05:42.033 --> 05:42.967
WOMEN ARE SMARTER RIGHT NOW THAN

05:42.967 --> 05:44.433
THE MEN, SO, YOU KNOW, IT'S

05:44.433 --> 05:45.533
GONNA TAKE THEM ABOUT ANOTHER

05:45.533 --> 05:46.533
150 YEARS.

05:46.533 --> 05:47.200
BUT THE PERSIANS ARE GREAT

05:47.200 --> 05:47.934
NEGOTIATORS.

05:47.934 --> 05:48.667
THE IRANIANS ARE GREAT

05:48.667 --> 05:50.133
NEGOTIATORS, SO -- AND THEY,

05:50.133 --> 05:51.133
THEY JUST KILLED --

05:51.133 --> 05:56.200
THEY JUST KILLED US.

05:56.200 --> 05:57.700
>> John: HOLY SHIT.

05:57.700 --> 05:58.667
THAT IS NOT A FUNCTIONAL USE OF

05:58.667 --> 05:59.734
LANGUAGE.

05:59.734 --> 06:01.000
THAT IS A DRUNK DRIVER CRASHING

06:01.000 --> 06:01.500
A PICKUP TRUCK FULL OF

06:01.500 --> 06:02.734
ALPHABET SOUP.

06:02.734 --> 06:04.600
TRUMP'S ACTUAL SPEECH PATTERNS

06:04.600 --> 06:05.734
SOUND LIKE WHEN YOU WRITE A LONG

06:05.734 --> 06:07.233
TEXT BY CHOOSING ONLY

06:07.233 --> 06:08.166
THE PREDICTIVE TEXT YOUR

06:08.166 --> 06:09.800
iPHONE SUGGESTS FOR YOU.

06:09.800 --> 06:10.900
SERIOUSLY.

06:10.900 --> 06:12.567
WE WROTE A MESSAGE LIKE THAT,

06:12.567 --> 06:13.433
STARTING WITH THE WORDS

06:13.433 --> 06:14.800
"THE NUCLEAR," AND HERE'S

06:14.800 --> 06:16.700
WHAT WE GOT.

06:16.700 --> 06:18.200
>> THE NUCLEAR TEST PROGRAM WAS

06:18.200 --> 06:19.633
NOT OPPOSED BY THE OTHER PERSON

06:19.633 --> 06:21.200
WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY WANT AND

06:21.200 --> 06:22.467
THEN THE DELAY IS NOT BEING DONE

06:22.467 --> 06:23.867
BY ANY OTHER COUNTRY AND THAT IS

06:23.867 --> 06:25.333
NOT THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE SURE

06:25.333 --> 06:26.900
THE WORLD CAN DO MORE THINGS

06:26.900 --> 06:28.166
AND THINGS LIKE THAT

06:28.166 --> 06:29.600
AND GENTLEMEN AND THEN THE OTHER

06:29.600 --> 06:30.667
PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN TOLD TO

06:30.667 --> 06:32.100
LEAVE THEM ALONE WITH THEIR

06:32.100 --> 06:35.667
CHILDREN WHO ARE ALSO VERY SAD.

06:35.667 --> 06:37.433
>> John: THAT MAKES EXACTLY

06:37.433 --> 06:38.500
AS MUCH, AND POTENTIALLY MORE

06:38.500 --> 06:41.333
SENSE, THAN TRUMP'S SPEECH

06:41.333 --> 06:42.367
ABOUT THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL.

06:42.367 --> 06:43.667
MEANING AN iPHONE WOULD BE

06:43.667 --> 06:45.033
A MORE COHERENT PRESIDENT

06:45.033 --> 06:47.100
OF THE UNITED STATES.

06:47.100 --> 06:48.834
BUT WITH TRUMP, WE'RE FAMILIAR

06:48.834 --> 06:50.066
ENOUGH WITH HIS SPEECH PATTERNS

06:50.066 --> 06:51.467
THAT YOU GET THE BASIC GIST

06:51.467 --> 06:53.567
OF WHAT HE'S TRYING TO SAY.

06:53.567 --> 06:54.934
THE REAL DAMAGE ISN'T IN HOW HE

06:54.934 --> 06:56.834
SAYS THINGS, BUT FROM THREE KEY

06:56.834 --> 06:58.967
TECHNIQUES HE USES TO INSULATE

06:58.967 --> 07:00.533
HIMSELF FROM CRITICISM

07:00.533 --> 07:01.533
AND CONSEQUENCE.

07:01.533 --> 07:03.066
AND IF WE'RE NOT EXTREMELY

07:03.066 --> 07:04.433
CAREFUL, ALL THREE COULD HAVE

07:04.433 --> 07:05.934
SERIOUS IMPACTS

07:05.934 --> 07:07.300
THAT FAR OUTLAST HIS PRESIDENCY.

07:07.300 --> 07:07.767
AND LET'S START

07:07.767 --> 07:09.166
WITH THE FIRST ONE.

07:09.166 --> 07:11.467
DELEGITIMIZING THE MEDIA.

07:11.467 --> 07:12.734
TRUMP'S BEEN ATTACKING THE PRESS

07:12.734 --> 07:13.867
SINCE HE DECLARED HIS CANDIDACY,

07:13.867 --> 07:15.133
AND IN A BROADER SENSE,

07:15.133 --> 07:16.367
HE'S BEEN WAGING WAR ON THE

07:16.367 --> 07:18.100
VERY CONCEPT OF TRUTH EVER SINCE

07:18.100 --> 07:19.066
HE FIRST TURNED TO HIS MOM

07:19.066 --> 07:21.233
AND SAID "DA-DA," AND SHE SAID,

07:21.233 --> 07:22.367
"NO, I'M MAMA," AND HE SAID,

07:22.367 --> 07:23.166
"FAKE NEWS!"

07:23.166 --> 07:27.667
AND SHIT HIS PANTS.

07:27.667 --> 07:28.867
NOW, THE DIFFERENCE NOW IS, HE'S

07:28.867 --> 07:30.200
CRYING FAKE NEWS AS PRESIDENT

07:30.200 --> 07:31.200
OF THE UNITED STATES, AND HE'S

07:31.200 --> 07:32.767
OPENLY PROUD OF IT TO THE POINT

07:32.767 --> 07:34.200
THAT HE RECENTLY TRIED TO TAKE

07:34.200 --> 07:36.367
OWNERSHIP OF THE TERM ITSELF.

07:36.367 --> 07:38.667
>> THE MEDIA IS, IS REALLY

07:38.667 --> 07:40.734
THE WORD, I THINK ONE OF THE

07:40.734 --> 07:42.066
GREATEST OF ALL TERMS

07:42.066 --> 07:43.500
I'VE COME UP WITH IS "FAKE."

07:43.500 --> 07:44.667
I GUESS OTHER PEOPLE HAVE USED

07:44.667 --> 07:45.900
IT, PERHAPS, OVER THE YEARS,

07:45.900 --> 07:48.333
BUT I'VE NEVER NOTICED IT.

07:48.333 --> 07:49.800
>> John: HE JUST TOOK CREDIT FOR

07:49.800 --> 07:51.400
INVENTING THE TERM "FAKE NEWS,"

07:51.400 --> 07:52.433
WHICH, FOR THE RECORD,

07:52.433 --> 07:57.000
HE DIDN'T.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.200
MEANING WHAT HE JUST SAID,

07:59.200 --> 08:00.400
WAS FAKE "FAKE NEWS" NEWS.

08:00.400 --> 08:01.033
AND YOU COULD IMAGINE HIM

08:01.033 --> 08:01.667
SAYING, "WELL, I'M NOT THE FIRST

08:01.667 --> 08:02.166
POLITICIAN TO CRITICIZE

08:02.166 --> 08:03.100
THE PRESS.

08:03.100 --> 08:04.000
WHAT ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON?

08:04.000 --> 08:04.700
WHAT ABOUT BARACK OBAMA?

08:04.700 --> 08:06.233
WHAT ABOUT BERNIE SANDERS?"

08:06.233 --> 08:07.700
AND THAT ACTUALLY BRINGS US

08:07.700 --> 08:08.700
TO TRUMP'S SECOND TECHNIQUE,

08:08.700 --> 08:10.100
SOMETHING CALLED

08:10.100 --> 08:11.567
"WHATABOUTISM?"

08:11.567 --> 08:12.700
IT'S THE PRACTICE OF CHANGING

08:12.700 --> 08:14.233
THE SUBJECT TO SOMEONE ELSE'S

08:14.233 --> 08:16.133
PERCEIVED WRONGDOING.

08:16.133 --> 08:17.533
TRUMP DOES IT ALL THE TIME,

08:17.533 --> 08:18.800
MOST FAMOUSLY WHEN HE WAS ASKED

08:18.800 --> 08:19.633
WHY HE HADN'T FORCEFULLY

08:19.633 --> 08:20.700
CONDEMNED THE NEO-NAZIS

08:20.700 --> 08:22.166
IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, AND THIS WAS

08:22.166 --> 08:24.200
HIS RESPONSE.

08:24.200 --> 08:25.633
>> WHAT ABOUT THE ALT-LEFT THAT

08:25.633 --> 08:27.400
CAME CHARGING AT THE, AS YOU SAY

08:27.400 --> 08:28.834
THE ALT-RIGHT?

08:28.834 --> 08:30.133
DO THEY HAVE ANY SEMBLANCE

08:30.133 --> 08:31.200
OF GUILT?

08:31.200 --> 08:32.266
WHAT ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY

08:32.266 --> 08:33.800
CAME CHARGING, THAT THEY CAME

08:33.800 --> 08:36.200
CHARGING WITH CLUBS IN THEIR

08:36.200 --> 08:37.166
HANDS, SWINGING CLUBS?

08:37.166 --> 08:40.266
DO THEY HAVE ANY PROBLEM?

08:40.266 --> 08:47.834
>> John: WELL, ACTUALLY, NO.

08:47.834 --> 08:53.567
BECAUSE A NAZI KILLING SOMEONE

08:53.567 --> 09:00.033
WITH A CAR IS SO HEINOUS

09:00.033 --> 09:01.033
YOU CAN BE WEARING

09:01.033 --> 09:01.667
CROCS WITH SOCKS, BUT YOU'RE

09:01.667 --> 09:02.200
USING THOSE SOCKED CROCS

09:02.200 --> 09:05.867
TO KICK NAZIS IN THE BALLS,

09:05.867 --> 09:06.700
THIS TECHNIQUE OF SAYING

09:06.700 --> 09:07.400
"WHAT ABOUT?" IS ACTUALLY

09:07.400 --> 09:08.100
AN OLD SOVIET PROPAGANDA TOOL,

09:08.100 --> 09:09.700
AND THE REASON IT'S DANGEROUS

09:09.700 --> 09:10.767
IS BECAUSE IT IMPLIES THAT ALL

09:10.767 --> 09:12.500
ACTIONS, REGARDLESS OF CONTEXT,

09:12.500 --> 09:14.166
SHARE A MORAL EQUIVALENCY,

09:14.166 --> 09:15.900
AND SINCE NOBODY'S PERFECT,

09:15.900 --> 09:17.767
ALL CRITICISM IS HYPOCRITICAL

09:17.767 --> 09:18.433
AND EVERYBODY SHOULD DO WHATEVER

09:18.433 --> 09:20.900
THEY WANT.

09:20.900 --> 09:21.700
IT'S A DEPRESSINGLY

09:21.700 --> 09:23.266
EFFECTIVE TOOL, WHICH IS WHY,

09:23.266 --> 09:24.500
ON TRUMP'S FAVORITE NETWORK,

09:24.500 --> 09:26.600
YOU HEAR IT ALL THE TIME.

09:26.600 --> 09:29.600
>> THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA FOCUSED

09:29.600 --> 09:31.900
ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN --

09:31.900 --> 09:32.700
AND ALLEGATIONS

09:32.700 --> 09:33.333
OF COLLUSIONS WITH THE RUSSIANS.

09:33.333 --> 09:34.233
WHAT ABOUT THE DEMOCRAT'S

09:34.233 --> 09:35.400
POSSIBLE TIES TO MOSCOW?

09:35.400 --> 09:36.533
>> FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY

09:36.533 --> 09:37.900
ADVISOR, GENERAL MICHAEL FLYNN

09:37.900 --> 09:39.033
INVESTIGATED FOR PRIVATE MEETING

09:39.033 --> 09:39.967
WITH RUSSIA, WHAT ABOUT HILLARY

09:39.967 --> 09:41.367
CLINTON?

09:41.367 --> 09:42.033
>> THE MEDIA WANTS TO CALL INTO

09:42.033 --> 09:43.100
QUESTION THE CREDIBILITY

09:43.100 --> 09:44.166
AND THE TRUSTWORTHINESS

09:44.166 --> 09:45.533
OF THIS ADMINISTRATION.

09:45.533 --> 09:46.800
BUT WHAT ABOUT BENGHAZI?

09:46.800 --> 09:47.700
WHAT ABOUT THE BLATANT LIES THAT

09:47.700 --> 09:48.367
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

09:48.367 --> 09:49.166
TOLD US?

09:49.166 --> 09:51.400
WHAT ABOUT THE BLATANT LIES

09:51.400 --> 09:52.233
WHAT ABOUT THE FACT THAT

09:52.233 --> 09:53.934
BEN RHODES BRAG ABOUT LYING TO

09:53.934 --> 09:55.100
THE MEDIA ABOUT THE IRAN DEAL?

09:55.100 --> 09:56.433
WHAT ABOUT THE FACT THAT

09:56.433 --> 09:57.700
JONATHAN GRUBER BASICALLY SAID

09:57.700 --> 09:59.700
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE STUPID?

09:59.700 --> 10:01.800
>> John: OKAY, STOP, STOP.

10:01.800 --> 10:02.934
BECAUSE HERE'S THE THING.

10:02.934 --> 10:04.567
NONE OF THE ERRORS THOSE PEOPLE

10:04.567 --> 10:05.667
MAY HAVE MADE IN THE PAST EXCUSE

10:05.667 --> 10:06.433
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S

10:06.433 --> 10:07.100
ACTIONS.

10:07.100 --> 10:08.834
A DEFENSE ATTORNEY COULDN'T

10:08.834 --> 10:10.600
STAND UP IN COURT AND SAY:

10:10.600 --> 10:11.867
"MAYBE MY CLIENT DID MURDER

10:11.867 --> 10:13.533
THOSE PEOPLE.

10:13.533 --> 10:14.133
BUT I ASK YOU WHAT ABOUT

10:14.133 --> 10:15.433
JEFFREY DAHMER?

10:15.433 --> 10:16.433
WHAT ABOUT AL CAPONE?

10:16.433 --> 10:17.500
WHAT ABOUT THE GUY FROM

10:17.500 --> 10:18.233
'THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS'?

10:18.233 --> 10:22.734
I REST MY CASE."

10:22.734 --> 10:24.467
I REST MY CASE.

10:24.467 --> 10:26.066
THE PROBLEM WITH WHATABOUTISM

10:26.066 --> 10:27.400
IS, IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY SOLVE

10:27.400 --> 10:30.133
A PROBLEM OR WIN AN ARGUMENT.

10:30.133 --> 10:30.900
THE POINT IS JUST TO MUDDY

10:30.900 --> 10:31.767
THE WATERS,

10:31.767 --> 10:32.767
WHICH CAN MAKE THE OTHER SIDE

10:32.767 --> 10:33.700
MAD.

10:33.700 --> 10:35.166
AND THAT ACTUALLY BRINGS US

10:35.166 --> 10:36.333
TO TRUMP'S THIRD TECHNIQUE:

10:36.333 --> 10:38.800
TROLLING.

10:38.800 --> 10:39.467
NOW, TROLLING ITSELF HAS BEEN

10:39.467 --> 10:40.667
AROUND FOR YEARS.

10:40.667 --> 10:41.600
IT'S BASICALLY 80% OF WHAT

10:41.600 --> 10:43.333
HAPPENS ON THE INTERNET.

10:43.333 --> 10:44.834
IT'S WHEN A YOUTUBE COMMENTER

10:44.834 --> 10:45.934
SAYS SOMETHING WILLFULLY

10:45.934 --> 10:48.066
PROVOCATIVE, LIKE SAYING

10:48.066 --> 10:49.133
"I'VE AGED LIKE AN APPLE CORE

10:49.133 --> 10:51.700
IN A DUMPSTER," OR THAT I

10:51.700 --> 10:52.934
"LOOK LIKE A FUCKING PICKLE

10:52.934 --> 10:55.667
WITH GLASSES."

10:55.667 --> 10:56.967
NOW, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER

10:56.967 --> 10:57.700
THEY MEAN ANY OF THAT.

10:57.700 --> 10:58.500
THE POINT IS JUST TO GET

10:58.500 --> 10:59.900
A REACTION AND HURT MY FEELINGS,

10:59.900 --> 11:01.266
WHICH BY THE WAY,

11:01.266 --> 11:04.233
IT ABSOLUTELY DOES.

11:04.233 --> 11:05.967
BUT TRUMP MAY WELL BE

11:05.967 --> 11:06.667
THE FIRST-EVER TROLL TO BE

11:06.667 --> 11:11.367
ELECTED PRESIDENT.

11:11.367 --> 11:12.433
THAT'S RIGHT, I SAID "ELECTED."

11:12.433 --> 11:13.233
REMEMBER, 10TH PRESIDENT

11:13.233 --> 11:14.233
SPRINKLES FUZZWIZARD

11:14.233 --> 11:14.934
ASSUMED OFFICE AFTER WILLIAM

11:14.934 --> 11:15.667
HENRY HARRISON DIED.

11:15.667 --> 11:18.133
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, HOLD ON.

11:18.133 --> 11:22.166
SPRINKLES FUZZWIZARD

11:22.166 --> 11:23.200
WAS NOT AMERICA'S

11:23.200 --> 11:23.800
10TH PRESIDENT.

11:23.800 --> 11:24.266
REALLY?

11:24.266 --> 11:25.033
WHO WAS AMERICA'S

11:25.033 --> 11:28.333
10TH PRESIDENT?

11:28.333 --> 11:29.133
EXACTLY.

11:29.133 --> 11:30.000
LET'S ASSUME I'M RIGHT.

11:30.000 --> 11:30.633
THE POINT IS, AS A TROLL,

11:30.633 --> 11:32.633
TRUMP OFTEN DOES THINGS THAT

11:32.633 --> 11:33.667
HAVE NO EFFECT OTHER THAN TO

11:33.667 --> 11:35.100
PISS OFF HIS PERCEIVED ENEMIES.

11:35.100 --> 11:36.367
LIKE WHEN HE TWEETED THIS

11:36.367 --> 11:37.500
WRESTLING GIF OF HIMSELF

11:37.500 --> 11:39.633
BODY-SLAMMING CNN OR ATTACKED

11:39.633 --> 11:40.867
MIKA BRZEZINSKI BY SAYING

11:40.867 --> 11:41.700
SHE WAS BLEEDING BADLY

11:41.700 --> 11:42.700
FROM A FACE LIFT OR,

11:42.700 --> 11:45.233
AS WE'VE MENTIONED, CALLED

11:45.233 --> 11:46.266
A LEADER WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONS

11:46.266 --> 11:48.133
SHORT AND FAT.

11:48.133 --> 11:49.367
AND TRUMP EVEN ONCE RETWEETED

11:49.367 --> 11:50.567
A CLAIM THAT HE WAS THE

11:50.567 --> 11:52.700
THE MOST SUPERIOR TROLL ON THE

11:52.700 --> 11:54.266
WHOLE OF TWITTER, CALLING IT

11:54.266 --> 11:56.433
"A GREAT COMPLIMENT!"

11:56.433 --> 11:58.000
WHICH IT ISN'T.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.333
BECAUSE SOMETIMES WHEN YOU DO

11:59.333 --> 12:00.400
SOMETHING THAT MAKES A LOT OF

12:00.400 --> 12:01.433
PEOPLE MAD, IT'S BECAUSE --

12:01.433 --> 12:03.066
AND BEAR WITH ME HERE --

12:03.066 --> 12:06.066
YOU'RE A DICK.

12:06.066 --> 12:07.834
IF YOU SNEAK INTO SOMEONE'S

12:07.834 --> 12:10.066
HOUSE AND URINATE IN EVERY

12:10.066 --> 12:11.700
HEATING VENT AND THEY GET MAD

12:11.700 --> 12:13.000
AT YOU, YOU ARE NOT AN EPIC

12:13.000 --> 12:14.734
TROLL STICKING IT

12:14.734 --> 12:16.233
TO THE SNOWFLAKE CUCKS.

12:16.233 --> 12:17.166
YOU'RE JUST SOME FUCKING

12:17.166 --> 12:19.100
ASSHOLE.

12:19.100 --> 12:20.400
BUT THE THING IS, TRUMP'S

12:20.400 --> 12:22.133
TROLLING IS NOT WITHOUT

12:22.133 --> 12:23.433
POLITICAL VALUE.

12:23.433 --> 12:25.000
DESPITE TRUMP'S FEW REAL POLICY

12:25.000 --> 12:26.333
ACCOMPLISHMENTS TO DATE, HE HAS

12:26.333 --> 12:29.066
CONSISTENTLY ACHIEVED ONE THING:

12:29.066 --> 12:30.200
MAKING HIS ENEMIES UNHAPPY.

12:30.200 --> 12:31.867
AND FOR MANY SUPPORTERS,

12:31.867 --> 12:32.700
THAT ITSELF COUNTS AS A MAJOR

12:32.700 --> 12:34.300
VICTORY.

12:34.300 --> 12:35.200
JUST LISTEN TO HOW

12:35.200 --> 12:37.100
"FOX AND FRIENDS" REACTED AFTER

12:37.100 --> 12:37.967
TRUMP FREAKED PEOPLE OUT BY

12:37.967 --> 12:39.667
STANDING WITH MILITARY LEADERS

12:39.667 --> 12:40.834
DURING RISING TENSIONS WITH

12:40.834 --> 12:42.533
NORTH KOREA AND SUGGESTING IT

12:42.533 --> 12:45.600
WAS THE "CALM BEFORE THE STORM."

12:45.600 --> 12:46.266
>> I THINK HE IS TROLLING

12:46.266 --> 12:48.100
THE MEDIA.

12:48.100 --> 12:48.834
>> I THINK HE IS TOTALLY

12:48.834 --> 12:51.533
TROLLING THE MEDIA THERE.

12:51.533 --> 12:52.133
EVEN THE SMILE

12:52.133 --> 12:53.000
AND THE WINK?

12:53.000 --> 12:54.200
>> THOSE OF US THAT ARE SICK OF

12:54.200 --> 12:54.800
THE STATUS QUO, THE FORGOTTEN

12:54.800 --> 12:55.767
MEN AND WOMEN WHO VOTED FOR

12:55.767 --> 12:56.900
PRESIDENT TRUMP, WANT THAT TOWN

12:56.900 --> 12:58.233
TO FREAK OUT.

12:58.233 --> 12:59.033
I WANT THOSE REPORTERS GOING

12:59.033 --> 12:59.500
"WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

12:59.500 --> 13:00.567
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?"

13:00.567 --> 13:02.467
IT'S BEAUTIFUL TO WATCH.

13:02.467 --> 13:03.734
>> John: IS IT?

13:03.734 --> 13:06.867
WHY?

13:06.867 --> 13:07.834
I'M GENUINELY SERIOUS.

13:07.834 --> 13:08.967
WHO BENEFITS FROM MASS CONFUSION

13:08.967 --> 13:09.700
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE ABOUT

13:09.700 --> 13:11.100
TO GO TO WAR?

13:11.100 --> 13:11.967
ARE THERE THOUSANDS OF

13:11.967 --> 13:13.633
UNEMPLOYED FACTORY WORKERS

13:13.633 --> 13:14.567
ACROSS THE MIDWEST GOING,

13:14.567 --> 13:15.633
"WELL, THE PLANT CLOSED DOWN

13:15.633 --> 13:17.400
AND I LOST MY HEALTH CARE, BUT

13:17.400 --> 13:18.233
SOMEWHERE A "WASHINGTON POST"

13:18.233 --> 13:19.133
REPORTER IS SCARED OF DYING,

13:19.133 --> 13:20.367
SO THINGS ARE LOOKING UP.

13:20.367 --> 13:22.500
MAGA!"

13:22.500 --> 13:24.467
JUDGING YOUR POLITICAL SUCCESS

13:24.467 --> 13:25.767
ON HOW BAD YOU MAKE OTHER PEOPLE

13:25.767 --> 13:27.300
FEEL MAKES ABOUT AS MUCH SENSE

13:27.300 --> 13:28.834
AS JUDGING YOUR SUCCESS

13:28.834 --> 13:30.467
AS A ZOOKEEPER BY HOW MANY BEARS

13:30.467 --> 13:32.900
YOU FUCK.

13:32.900 --> 13:36.233
"OH, WOW.

13:36.233 --> 13:37.400
THAT IS NOT YOUR JOB!

13:37.400 --> 13:38.033
I MEAN, I GUESS IT'S IMPRESSIVE

13:38.033 --> 13:38.967
IN ITS OWN WAY, BUT IT'S

13:38.967 --> 13:40.066
DEFINITELY NOT WHAT YOU'RE

13:40.066 --> 13:42.900
SUPPOSED TO BE DOING."

13:42.900 --> 13:45.000
AND THE SUREST PROOF OF TROLLING

13:45.000 --> 13:45.734
OFTEN COMES WHEN A TROLL

13:45.734 --> 13:46.867
IS CONFRONTED.

13:46.867 --> 13:48.333
BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN THEY HAVE TO

13:48.333 --> 13:50.066
PUT UP OR SHUT UP.

13:50.066 --> 13:51.133
YOU MAY'VE HEARD ABOUT CASES

13:51.133 --> 13:52.633
WHERE PEOPLE TRACKED DOWN THE

13:52.633 --> 13:53.867
SOURCE OF SOMETHING AWFUL THAT

13:53.867 --> 13:55.600
WAS POSTED ONLINE, ONLY TO FIND

13:55.600 --> 13:57.767
SOME SULLEN 15-YEAR-OLD WHO JUST

13:57.767 --> 13:58.934
SHRUGS AND GOES, "I DUNNO WHY

13:58.934 --> 13:59.900
I WROTE THAT.

13:59.900 --> 14:04.600
I JUST DID IT.

14:04.600 --> 14:05.400
STOP ASKING ME SO MANY

14:05.400 --> 14:05.967
QUESTIONS."

14:05.967 --> 14:06.567
WELL, THAT IS BASICALLY

14:06.567 --> 14:09.467
OUR PRESIDENT NOW.

14:09.467 --> 14:10.266
I'LL SHOW YOU.

14:10.266 --> 14:11.033
REMEMBER WHEN TRUMP SAID

14:11.033 --> 14:11.734
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD SURVEILLED

14:11.734 --> 14:12.867
HIM IN TRUMP TOWER, TWEETING,

14:12.867 --> 14:13.633
"HOW LOW HAS PRESIDENT OBAMA

14:13.633 --> 14:16.433
GONE TO TAP-P-P MY PHONES"?

14:16.433 --> 14:17.266
WATCH WHAT HAPPENED WHEN HE WAS

14:17.266 --> 14:19.633
ASKED TO JUSTIFY THAT.

14:19.633 --> 14:20.800
>> WELL, YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED

14:20.800 --> 14:22.800
WITH SURVEILLANCE.

14:22.800 --> 14:23.734
AND I THINK THAT WAS

14:23.734 --> 14:24.433
INAPPROPRIATE, BUT THAT'S

14:24.433 --> 14:25.233
THE WAY --

14:25.233 --> 14:26.166
>> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, SIR?

14:26.166 --> 14:26.700
>> YOU CAN FIGURE THAT OUT

14:26.700 --> 14:27.000
YOURSELF.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.200
>> WELL, I -- THE REASON I ASK

14:28.200 --> 14:29.400
IS YOU SAID HE WAS --

14:29.400 --> 14:31.033
YOU CALLED HIM "SICK AND BAD."

14:31.033 --> 14:31.934
>> LOOK, YOU CAN FIGURE IT OUT

14:31.934 --> 14:33.266
YOURSELF.

14:33.266 --> 14:34.066
HE WAS VERY NICE TO ME WITH

14:34.066 --> 14:35.633
WORDS, BUT -- AND WHEN I WAS

14:35.633 --> 14:37.567
WITH HIM -- BUT AFTER THAT,

14:37.567 --> 14:39.000
THERE HAS BEEN NO RELATIONSHIP.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.233
>> BUT YOU STAND BY THAT CLAIM

14:40.233 --> 14:41.033
ABOUT HIM?

14:41.033 --> 14:42.266
>> I DON'T STAND BY ANYTHING.

14:42.266 --> 14:42.800
I JUST -- YOU CAN TAKE IT

14:42.800 --> 14:47.133
THE WAY YOU WANT.

14:47.133 --> 14:48.166
>> John: OKAY, SO LET'S WALK

14:48.166 --> 14:48.500
THROUGH THAT.

14:48.500 --> 14:51.200
ON THE INTERNET, HE CLAIMED THAT

14:51.200 --> 14:51.900
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

14:51.900 --> 14:52.533
STATES COMMITTED AN EXTREMELY

14:52.533 --> 14:53.033
SERIOUS CRIME.

14:53.033 --> 14:53.967
BUT IN PERSON, HE'S SUDDENLY

14:53.967 --> 14:56.667
BACKING DOWN, FIRST SAYING

14:56.667 --> 14:58.367
OBAMA WAS "VERY NICE TO HIM WITH

14:58.367 --> 14:58.834
WORDS."

14:58.834 --> 14:59.567
THEN THAT "I DON'T STAND

14:59.567 --> 15:01.567
BY ANYTHING."

15:01.567 --> 15:02.367
WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST

15:02.367 --> 15:03.233
FRIGHTENINGLY NIHILISTIC

15:03.233 --> 15:05.667
SENTENCES A PRESIDENT CAN SAY.

15:05.667 --> 15:06.800
I'D RATHER HEAR THAT FROM

15:06.800 --> 15:08.233
A CLOWN HOLDING A KNIFE

15:08.233 --> 15:10.033
THAN A PRESIDENT, BECAUSE

15:10.033 --> 15:11.100
AT LEAST WHEN THE CLOWN SAYS

15:11.100 --> 15:12.333
"I DON'T STAND BY ANYTHING,"

15:12.333 --> 15:13.133
YOU THINK, "YEAH.

15:13.133 --> 15:18.166
THAT KIND OF MAKES SENSE."

15:18.166 --> 15:19.166
PLEASE MAKE IT QUICK.

15:19.166 --> 15:19.800
AND IT GETS WORSE, BECAUSE THE

15:19.800 --> 15:20.600
INTERVIEW KEPT GOING, AND TRUMP

15:20.600 --> 15:22.367
WAS EXPLICITLY GIVEN THE OPTION

15:22.367 --> 15:23.967
TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT FOR

15:23.967 --> 15:25.233
THE "FAKE NEWS" MEDIA, BUT HE

15:25.233 --> 15:27.967
FLAT-OUT REFUSED.

15:27.967 --> 15:28.800
>> I JUST WANTED TO FIND OUT,

15:28.800 --> 15:29.367
THOUGH.

15:29.367 --> 15:29.967
YOU'RE -- YOU'RE THE PRESIDENT

15:29.967 --> 15:30.633
OF THE UNITED STATES.

15:30.633 --> 15:31.800
YOU SAID HE WAS "SICK AND BAD"

15:31.800 --> 15:33.600
BECAUSE HE HAD TAPPED YOU --

15:33.600 --> 15:34.166
>> YOU CAN TAKE -- ANY WAY.

15:34.166 --> 15:34.900
YOU CAN TAKE IT ANY WAY

15:34.900 --> 15:35.633
YOU WANT.

15:35.633 --> 15:36.500
>> BUT I'M ASKING YOU.

15:36.500 --> 15:37.033
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT IT

15:37.033 --> 15:41.400
TO BE --

15:41.400 --> 15:43.100
>> YOU DON'T HAVE TO --

15:43.100 --> 15:43.967
ASK ME.

15:43.967 --> 15:44.500
YOU DON'T HAVE TO ASK ME.

15:44.500 --> 15:44.867
>> WHY NOT?

15:44.867 --> 15:45.500
>> BECAUSE I HAVE MY OWN

15:45.500 --> 15:45.934
OPINIONS.

15:45.934 --> 15:46.600
YOU CAN HAVE YOUR OWN OPINIONS.

15:46.600 --> 15:47.100
>> BUT I WANT TO KNOW

15:47.100 --> 15:47.600
YOUR OPINIONS.

15:47.600 --> 15:48.033
YOU'RE THE PRESIDENT

15:48.033 --> 15:48.533
OF THE UNITED STATES.

15:48.533 --> 15:49.200
>> OKAY, IT'S ENOUGH.

15:49.200 --> 15:50.000
THANK YOU.

15:50.000 --> 16:00.533
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

16:00.533 --> 16:01.834
>> John: OKAY, SO THERE IS

16:01.834 --> 16:03.333
A LOT THAT IS INFURIATING ABOUT

16:03.333 --> 16:05.100
THAT CLIP, BUT TRUMP GOING BACK

16:05.100 --> 16:06.567
TO HIS DESK AND PRETENDING TO

16:06.567 --> 16:08.000
WORK HARD IS AN OBJECTIVELY

16:08.000 --> 16:10.567
FUNNY THING TO DO.

16:10.567 --> 16:11.734
THAT'S LIKE YOUR DOG

16:11.734 --> 16:13.166
AVOIDING QUESTIONS BY PRETENDING

16:13.166 --> 16:15.567
TO DO HIS TAXES.

16:15.567 --> 16:17.000
YOU NEVER DO THIS!

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
WHY WOULD YOU NEED TO DO IT NOW?

16:20.000 --> 16:21.467
AND WHILE THERE'S NOTHING NEW

16:21.467 --> 16:22.967
ABOUT ANY OF THESE

16:22.967 --> 16:24.100
TECHNIQUES, THEY'RE NOW COMING

16:24.100 --> 16:26.000
OUT OF THE OVAL OFFICE,

16:26.000 --> 16:27.734
WHICH NOT ONLY LEGITIMIZES THEM,

16:27.734 --> 16:29.700
IT RISKS THEM SPREADING.

16:29.700 --> 16:31.533
AND THAT, SADLY, IS HAPPENING.

16:31.533 --> 16:32.800
LAST MONTH, CONGRESSMAN

16:32.800 --> 16:33.834
PAUL GOSAR USED ALL THREE

16:33.834 --> 16:34.600
TECHNIQUES.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.300
FIRST, HE SUGGESTED

16:36.300 --> 16:37.266
IN AN INTERVIEW THAT THE MARCH

16:37.266 --> 16:38.934
IN CHARLOTTESVILLE MAY HAVE BEEN

16:38.934 --> 16:40.633
A FALSE FLAG OPERATION

16:40.633 --> 16:42.367
CREATED BY THE LEFT, WHICH IS

16:42.367 --> 16:44.967
PRETTY TROLL-Y.

16:44.967 --> 16:46.333
AND WHEN CONFRONTED, HE DEPLOYED

16:46.333 --> 16:53.667
THE OTHER TWO TOOLS.

16:53.667 --> 16:56.700
>> IT'S BEEN DEBUNKED.

16:56.700 --> 16:57.433
>> IT'S NOT BEEN DEBUNKED.

16:57.433 --> 16:57.934
ABSOLUTELY NOT DEBUNKED

16:57.934 --> 16:58.233
WHATSOEVER.

16:58.233 --> 16:59.033
SO STAY TUNED.

16:59.033 --> 16:59.633
>> THE CONSPIRACY THEORY THAT

16:59.633 --> 17:00.166
YOU PUT HAVE PUT OUT THERE

17:00.166 --> 17:00.667
HAS BEEN DEBUNKED.

17:00.667 --> 17:01.400
>> IT HAS NOT BEEN DEBUNKED.

17:01.400 --> 17:02.200
LOOK AT WHAT CNN HAS TALKED

17:02.200 --> 17:02.867
ABOUT WITH WHAT'S GOING ON

17:02.867 --> 17:03.967
WITH THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION

17:03.967 --> 17:04.633
RIGHT NOW WITH THE DOSSIER.

17:04.633 --> 17:05.533
HARDLY AN ASPECT IN REGARDS

17:05.533 --> 17:06.367
TO DEBUNKED.

17:06.367 --> 17:07.200
YOU'RE NOT REAL NEWS.

17:07.200 --> 17:08.567
YOU'RE FAKE NEWS.

17:08.567 --> 17:09.400
>> SIR, EVERYTHING YOU'VE SAID

17:09.400 --> 17:10.300
HAS BEEN DEBUNKED.

17:10.300 --> 17:11.333
WHY ARE YOU CONTINUING TO

17:11.333 --> 17:11.967
PUT THIS OUT THERE?

17:11.967 --> 17:12.834
>> FAKE NEWS.

17:12.834 --> 17:15.166
FAKE NEWS.

17:15.166 --> 17:16.700
>> John: SO HE'S BASICALLY JUST

17:16.700 --> 17:17.834
COPYING TRUMP.

17:17.834 --> 17:18.934
AND IF THERE'S ONE THING WORSE

17:18.934 --> 17:20.233
THAN SOMETHING TERRIBLE,

17:20.233 --> 17:21.567
IT'S A COVER BAND OF THAT

17:21.567 --> 17:23.467
TERRIBLE THING.

17:23.467 --> 17:25.200
IF TRUMP IS NICKELBACK,

17:25.200 --> 17:27.433
THAT MAN IS BICKLENACK.

17:27.433 --> 17:28.533
NOT AS GOOD AT IT AS THE

17:28.533 --> 17:30.200
ORIGINAL AND A HORRIBLE SIGN

17:30.200 --> 17:32.400
THAT THE DISEASE IS SPREADING.

17:32.400 --> 17:34.333
THE PROBLEM IS, IF THAT BECOMES

17:34.333 --> 17:38.033
THE LEVEL OF DISCOURSE, WE ARE

17:38.033 --> 17:39.700
SERIOUSLY AND LASTINGLY FUCKED.

17:39.700 --> 17:41.266
AND JUST THIS WEEK, WE SAW SOME

17:41.266 --> 17:42.667
OF THESE TECHNIQUES PUSHED

17:42.667 --> 17:43.900
TO THE LIMIT BY THE SCANDAL

17:43.900 --> 17:45.200
INVOLVING ALABAMA SENATE

17:45.200 --> 17:46.500
CANDIDATE ROY MOORE, WHO HAS

17:46.500 --> 17:48.100
DENIED ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL

17:48.100 --> 17:50.433
MISCONDUCT WITH A 14-YEAR-OLD

17:50.433 --> 17:52.600
WHEN HE WAS 32 AND CALLED THEM

17:52.600 --> 17:54.266
"FAKE NEWS."

17:54.266 --> 17:55.567
AND WATCH SEAN HANNITY THEN USE

17:55.567 --> 17:56.900
WHATABOUTISM TO DERAIL

17:56.900 --> 17:59.500
A DISCUSSION ABOUT IT.

17:59.500 --> 18:00.867
>> THIS 14-YEAR-OLD GIRL

18:00.867 --> 18:01.633
PURPORTEDLY, ACCORDING TO

18:01.633 --> 18:03.033
"THE WASHINGTON POST," TOLD TWO

18:03.033 --> 18:04.100
OF HER GIRLFRIENDS WHAT HAPPENED

18:04.100 --> 18:05.033
IN REAL TIME.

18:05.033 --> 18:07.133
>> HERE'S A TOUGH QUESTION.

18:07.133 --> 18:08.233
DO YOU THINK BILL CLINTON,

18:08.233 --> 18:11.600
IN RETROSPECT, WAS A PREDATOR?

18:11.600 --> 18:12.600
>> John: BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT

18:12.600 --> 18:14.000
THIS DISCUSSION IS ABOUT.

18:14.000 --> 18:14.567
YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE SAID

18:14.567 --> 18:15.800
"HERE'S A TOUGH QUESTION:

18:15.800 --> 18:17.033
IF YOU HAD TO GUESS,

18:17.033 --> 18:18.800
HOW MANY LOBSTERS ARE THERE?

18:18.800 --> 18:19.800
LIKE, TOTAL.

18:19.800 --> 18:21.867
IN THE WORLD."

18:21.867 --> 18:22.567
IS THAT WORTH DISCUSSING?

18:22.567 --> 18:23.967
SURE!

18:23.967 --> 18:24.900
BUT FIRST LET'S FINISH TALKING

18:24.900 --> 18:25.834
ABOUT THE SENATE CANDIDATE

18:25.834 --> 18:27.100
WHO MAY'VE MADE SEXUAL ADVANCES

18:27.100 --> 18:28.266
ON A CHILD.

18:28.266 --> 18:29.333
AND LOOK, WHETHER CLINTON

18:29.333 --> 18:30.967
ENGAGED IN PREDATORY BEHAVIOR

18:30.967 --> 18:33.900
IS A LEGITIMATE QUESTION,

18:33.900 --> 18:36.467
BUT IT SHOULDN'T REALLY INFORM

18:36.467 --> 18:39.233
WHAT WE DO ABOUT ROY MOORE.

18:39.233 --> 18:39.934
AND EVEN IF YOU BELIEVE

18:39.934 --> 18:40.734
DEMOCRATS ARE GUILTY OF A DOUBLE

18:40.734 --> 18:41.300
STANDARD, THE SOLUTION ISN'T

18:41.300 --> 18:45.133
TO HAVE NO STANDARD WHATSOEVER.

18:45.133 --> 18:46.233
THIS IS WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO

18:46.233 --> 18:47.900
TRAIN OURSELVES TO IDENTIFY

18:47.900 --> 18:49.433
THESE TECHNIQUES, BECAUSE THEIR

18:49.433 --> 18:51.433
NATURAL ENDPOINT IS THE EROSION

18:51.433 --> 18:53.266
OF OUR ABILITY TO DECIDE WHAT'S

18:53.266 --> 18:55.166
IMPORTANT, HAVE AN HONEST DEBATE

18:55.166 --> 18:56.000
AND HOLD ONE ANOTHER

18:56.000 --> 18:56.867
ACCOUNTABLE.

18:56.867 --> 19:02.500
AND THAT EROSION CAN BE GRADUAL

19:02.500 --> 19:03.900
THAT IT'S HARD TO SPOT.

19:03.900 --> 19:04.767
IT'S LIKE BEING MURDERED

19:04.767 --> 19:05.233
BY A SLOTH.

19:05.233 --> 19:06.066
IT HAPPENS VERY SLOWLY,

19:06.066 --> 19:07.333
AND YOU MIGHT NOT NOTICE

19:07.333 --> 19:10.867
UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE.

19:10.867 --> 19:14.200
LISTEN, THIS IS ALL BLEAK.

19:14.200 --> 19:15.600
I CAN'T PRETEND THAT IT ISN'T,

19:15.600 --> 19:16.867
WHICH IS WHY IT'S IMPORTANT

19:16.867 --> 19:17.734
TO TAKE SOME HOPE FROM

19:17.734 --> 19:18.867
THIS YEAR'S SMALL VICTORIES.

19:18.867 --> 19:19.867
LIKE THE MUSLIM BAN BEING

19:19.867 --> 19:21.300
BLOCKED BY THE COURTS

19:21.300 --> 19:24.533
AFTER MASSIVE PUBLIC PROTESTS.

19:24.533 --> 19:25.700
OR THE ATTEMPTS TO REPEAL

19:25.700 --> 19:26.834
OBAMACARE STALLING,

19:26.834 --> 19:27.767
THANKS IN PART TO PEOPLE

19:27.767 --> 19:29.767
PRESSURING THEIR LAWMAKERS.

19:29.767 --> 19:32.700
AND JUST THIS WEEK, IN VIRGINIA,

19:32.700 --> 19:34.467
VOTERS REJECTED ED GILLESPIE

19:34.467 --> 19:35.667
FOR GOVERNOR AFTER HE RAN

19:35.667 --> 19:36.500
A TRUMP-STYLE DOG-WHISTLE

19:36.500 --> 19:39.233
CAMPAIGN,

19:39.233 --> 19:40.767
THAT IS ENCOURAGING.

19:40.767 --> 19:42.266
IT'S NICE TO KNOW THAT IF YOU

19:42.266 --> 19:42.934
USE TRUMP'S TACTICS IN A

19:42.934 --> 19:44.800
VIRGINIA GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION,

19:44.800 --> 19:46.867
YOU DO NOT GET TO BE GUBERNATOR.

19:46.867 --> 19:48.467
FURTHER DOWN THE BALLOT THERE,

19:48.467 --> 19:49.834
TUESDAY ALSO MARKED THE DEFEAT

19:49.834 --> 19:51.300
OF BOB MARSHALL, WHO EARLIER

19:51.300 --> 19:52.467
THIS YEAR PROPOSED A SO-CALLED

19:52.467 --> 19:54.300
BATHROOM BILL.

19:54.300 --> 19:56.066
HE LOST TO DANICA ROEM, WHO WILL

19:56.066 --> 19:58.533
NOW BE VIRGINIA'S FIRST

19:58.533 --> 20:00.900
OPENLY TRANSGENDER LEGISLATOR.

20:00.900 --> 20:02.600
AND THE TONE SHE'S TAKEN

20:02.600 --> 20:05.233
IS ALREADY MARKEDLY DIFFERENT.

20:05.233 --> 20:06.333
>> DANICA, YOU WERE RUNNING

20:06.333 --> 20:08.266
AGAINST ROBERT MARSHALL,

20:08.266 --> 20:10.567
AN INCUMBENT, 13-TERM INCUMBENT.

20:10.567 --> 20:12.967
HE'S ALSO A MAN WHO REFERRED

20:12.967 --> 20:14.667
TO HIMSELF AS VIRGINIA'S CHIEF

20:14.667 --> 20:16.300
HOMOPHOBE.

20:16.300 --> 20:17.734
HE REFUSED TO DEBATE YOU

20:17.734 --> 20:18.767
DURING THE CAMPAIGN.

20:18.767 --> 20:19.633
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO

20:19.633 --> 20:20.500
SAY TO HIM?

20:20.500 --> 20:21.867
>> COME JANUARY, DELEGATE

20:21.867 --> 20:22.433
MARSHALL WILL BE ONE OF

20:22.433 --> 20:25.200
MY CONSTITUENTS.

20:25.200 --> 20:26.066
AND I'M NOT GONNA DISRESPECT

20:26.066 --> 20:29.333
MY OWN CONSTITUENTS.

20:29.333 --> 20:31.800
>> John: WOW.

20:31.800 --> 20:34.033
THAT IS INCREDIBLY REFRESHING.

20:34.033 --> 20:34.934
JUST THINK ABOUT THAT.

20:34.934 --> 20:36.066
SHE BEAT A MAN WHO OPENLY

20:36.066 --> 20:37.200
DISRESPECTED HER, BUT GIVEN THE

20:37.200 --> 20:38.867
OPPORTUNITY, SHE CHOSE NOT

20:38.867 --> 20:40.166
TO RESPOND BY TWEETING

20:40.166 --> 20:41.400
"I'LL FIGHT FOR BOB'S RIGHT

20:41.400 --> 20:42.467
TO USE ANY BATHROOM HE WANTS,

20:42.467 --> 20:43.834
BUT IT'S TOO LATE.

20:43.834 --> 20:44.600
HE ALREADY SHIT THE BED

20:44.600 --> 20:45.533
ON ELECTION DAY.

20:45.533 --> 20:53.867
SAD!"

20:53.867 --> 20:54.767
AND LOOK, TUESDAY'S RESULTS

20:54.767 --> 20:55.633
SHOULD NOT MAKE YOU COMPLACENT.

20:55.633 --> 20:56.533
THEY ARE NO GUARANTEE THAT THE

20:56.533 --> 20:58.967
MIDTERMS WILL TURN OUT WELL.

20:58.967 --> 21:00.233
THAT'S WHY YOU SHOULD TAKE THESE

21:00.233 --> 21:01.633
MOMENTS OF ENCOURAGEMENT TO HELP

21:01.633 --> 21:02.533
YOU KEEP GOING.

21:02.533 --> 21:03.734
BECAUSE THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY

21:03.734 --> 21:05.300
IS BASICALLY A MARATHON.

21:05.300 --> 21:07.567
IT'S PAINFUL, POINTLESS, AND THE

21:07.567 --> 21:08.834
MAJORITY OF YOU DIDN'T EVEN

21:08.834 --> 21:09.667
AGREE TO RUN IT.

21:09.667 --> 21:10.600
YOU WERE JUST SIGNED UP

21:10.600 --> 21:12.800
BY YOUR DUMBEST FRIEND.

21:12.800 --> 21:14.633
AND THE FACT IS, WE'RE NOT EVEN

21:14.633 --> 21:19.500
AT MILE 6 RIGHT NOW OR POSSIBLY

21:19.500 --> 21:20.567
EVEN MILE 3, SO THERE IS

21:20.567 --> 21:21.333
A LONG WAY TO GO.

21:21.333 --> 21:22.266
AND THOUGH YOU'RE EXHAUSTED

21:22.266 --> 21:23.767
AND YOUR WHOLE BODY IS SCREAMING

21:23.767 --> 21:24.967
FOR YOU TO GIVE UP AND YOUR

21:24.967 --> 21:26.500
NIPPLES ARE CHAFING FOR SOME

21:26.500 --> 21:28.433
REASON, THE STAKES ARE TOO HIGH

21:28.433 --> 21:32.967
FOR ANY OF US TO STOP.

21:32.967 --> 21:34.233
AND I DO REALIZE THAT I'M SAYING

21:34.233 --> 21:35.066
THAT AS WE'RE ABOUT TO STOP

21:35.066 --> 21:35.800
DOING SHOWS FOR THE YEAR.

21:35.800 --> 21:37.033
BUT HERE'S THE THING.

21:37.033 --> 21:38.467
WE WON'T BE GOING AWAY ENTIRELY.

21:38.467 --> 21:39.633
YOU MAY REMEMBER EARLIER THIS

21:39.633 --> 21:41.066
YEAR, WE USED OUR

21:41.066 --> 21:42.367
CATHETER COWBOY TO TRY AND GET

21:42.367 --> 21:43.633
INFORMATION TO THE PRESIDENT

21:43.633 --> 21:44.633
IN THE AD BREAKS

21:44.633 --> 21:48.300
OF "FOX & FRIENDS."

21:48.300 --> 21:49.300
WELL, TRUMP IS STILL WATCHING

21:49.300 --> 21:49.567
THAT SHOW.

21:49.567 --> 21:50.667
WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE "THE TIMES"

21:50.667 --> 21:51.800
WROTE A GENERALLY NEGATIVE PIECE

21:51.800 --> 21:52.967
ABOUT ITS ENORMOUS INFLUENCE

21:52.967 --> 21:54.767
ON HIM, AND, BECAUSE OF THAT,

21:54.767 --> 21:56.166
CALLED IT THE "MOST POWERFUL

21:56.166 --> 21:58.100
TV SHOW IN AMERICA,"

21:58.100 --> 21:59.133
A SENTIMENT THE HOSTS

21:59.133 --> 22:00.967
WERE VERY EXCITED ABOUT.

22:00.967 --> 22:02.100
>> THIS PROGRAM, THE PROGRAM

22:02.100 --> 22:03.033
YOU'RE WATCHING, IS, ACCORDING

22:03.033 --> 22:06.033
TO "THE NEW YORK TIMES,"

22:06.033 --> 22:07.567
THE MOST POWERFUL TV SHOW

22:07.567 --> 22:08.900
IN AMERICA.

22:08.900 --> 22:09.900
>> DO YOU KNOW WHY, STEVE?

22:09.900 --> 22:10.867
BECAUSE WE HAVE THE BEST

22:10.867 --> 22:11.600
VIEWERS.

22:11.600 --> 22:12.700
>> YES.

22:12.700 --> 22:16.633
>> John: NO.

22:16.633 --> 22:17.734
NO, YOU DON'T.

22:17.734 --> 22:23.033
YOU ABSOLUTELY DON'T.

22:23.033 --> 22:24.066
DON'T MISUNDERSTAND.

22:24.066 --> 22:24.867
AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT WE HAVE

22:24.867 --> 22:28.900
THE BEST VIEWERS.

22:28.900 --> 22:32.000
NO, I'M NOT SAYING THAT.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.400
YOU GUYS ARE FINE.

22:34.400 --> 22:36.133
THE BEST AUDIENCE BELONGS TO

22:36.133 --> 22:37.400
"ELLEN," BECAUSE THIS IS HOW

22:37.400 --> 22:42.066
THEY GREET HER.

22:42.066 --> 22:42.800
>> HERE SHE IS NOW,

22:42.800 --> 22:45.867
ELLEN DeGENERES.

22:45.867 --> 22:50.200
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

22:50.200 --> 22:51.433
>> John: NONE OF YOU FUCKERS

22:51.433 --> 22:57.700
DID THAT WHEN I CAME OUT.

22:57.700 --> 22:58.500
NONE OF YOU DID IT.

22:58.500 --> 22:59.400
BUT THE POINT IS, JUST

22:59.400 --> 22:59.867
45 MINUTES AFTER THAT

22:59.867 --> 23:01.000
INFORMATION WAS ON FOX,

23:01.000 --> 23:02.233
TRUMP TWEETED, "WOW.

23:02.233 --> 23:03.767
THE FAILING 'NEW YORK TIMES'

23:03.767 --> 23:06.100
SAID ABOUT 'FOX & FRIENDS,'

23:06.100 --> 23:07.033
THE MOST POWERFUL TV SHOW

23:07.033 --> 23:09.200
IN AMERICA."

23:09.200 --> 23:10.567
SO INFORMATION GOES RIGHT FROM

23:10.567 --> 23:12.200
THAT SHOW INTO HIS BRAIN,

23:12.200 --> 23:14.433
WHICH IS TERRIBLE.

23:14.433 --> 23:15.433
BECAUSE WE'D GENUINELY BE BETTER

23:15.433 --> 23:16.667
OFF IF TRUMP WAS GETTING DAILY

23:16.667 --> 23:18.066
BRIEFINGS FROM AN ACTUAL FOX

23:18.066 --> 23:20.633
AND HIS FRIENDS, A HEDGEHOG

23:20.633 --> 23:21.934
AND A WEASEL WITH ITS HEAD STUCK

23:21.934 --> 23:24.967
IN A TIN CAN.

23:24.967 --> 23:29.133
BUT IF TRUMP'S GOING TO KEEP

23:29.133 --> 23:30.500
WATCHING THAT SHOW, WE'RE GOING

23:30.500 --> 23:33.767
TO SPEND OUR HIATUS SNEAKING

23:33.767 --> 23:34.600
INFORMATION THROUGH

23:34.600 --> 23:35.266
OUR CATHETER COWBOY.

23:35.266 --> 23:36.333
SO A NUMBER OF COMMERCIALS ARE

23:36.333 --> 23:38.033
GOING TO BE AIRING ON FOX

23:38.033 --> 23:38.967
NEWS OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS.

23:38.967 --> 23:39.633
HERE'S THE FIRST ONE.

23:39.633 --> 23:40.533
>> ATTENTION CATHETER PATIENTS.

23:40.533 --> 23:41.734
>> I'M A PROFESSIONAL COWBOY.

23:41.734 --> 23:42.433
I USE CATHETERS.

23:42.433 --> 23:44.233
AND THERE'S TWO THINGS I KNOW.

23:44.233 --> 23:46.066
I DON'T LIKE PAIN WHEN I CATH,

23:46.066 --> 23:47.667
AND THE TERM "CLEAN COAL"

23:47.667 --> 23:49.433
DOESN'T REFER TO THE PHYSICAL

23:49.433 --> 23:51.033
ACT OF CLEANING COAL.

23:51.033 --> 23:52.266
THAT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE.

23:52.266 --> 23:54.100
COAL IS COAL.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.100
"CLEAN COAL" IS A MARKETING TERM

23:55.100 --> 23:56.900
THE COAL INDUSTRY CAME UP WITH

23:56.900 --> 23:58.200
FOR STUFF LIKE CARBON CAPTURE

23:58.200 --> 23:59.900
AND SEQUESTRATION, AN EXPENSIVE

23:59.900 --> 24:01.800
PROCESS THAT'S SHOWN LIMITED

24:01.800 --> 24:04.467
RESULTS, AT BEST.

24:04.467 --> 24:06.300
ALSO FREDERICK DOUGLASS IS DEAD.

24:06.300 --> 24:15.300
MORE TOMORROW, BYE BYE!

24:15.300 --> 24:16.133
>> John: GOOD INFORMATION.

24:16.133 --> 24:16.633
THAT WILL BE ON FOX IN

24:16.633 --> 24:17.500
THE D.C. AREA LATER THIS WEEK.

24:17.500 --> 24:18.367
AND KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR MORE OF

24:18.367 --> 24:19.033
THEM, BECAUSE THAT COWBOY'S GOT

24:19.033 --> 24:20.266
A BUNCH UP HIS SLEEVE.

24:20.266 --> 24:21.533
>> THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS HAS

24:21.533 --> 24:23.834
A GOVERNOR, NOT A PRESIDENT.

24:23.834 --> 24:25.300
HERE'S A FUN FACT.

24:25.300 --> 24:27.000
THERE'S ACTUALLY NO FEDERAL LAW

24:27.000 --> 24:28.734
AGAINST THIS, THANKS TO

24:28.734 --> 24:30.200
SOMETHING CALLED

24:30.200 --> 24:32.100
THE FIRST AMENDMENT.

24:32.100 --> 24:33.500
JUST BECAUSE JARED KUSHNER

24:33.500 --> 24:35.166
IS SMARTER THAN YOU DOESN'T MEAN

24:35.166 --> 24:37.734
THAT HE'S SMART.

24:37.734 --> 24:38.667
THE NAVY SEALS AREN'T ACTUALLY

24:38.667 --> 24:41.300
SEALS.

24:41.300 --> 24:41.934
I KNOW, BUDDY.

24:41.934 --> 24:43.266
I WAS DISAPPOINTED TOO.

24:43.266 --> 24:44.600
THERE ARE MANY NON-GOLD

24:44.600 --> 24:46.200
DECOR SCHEMES THAT ARE ACTUALLY

24:46.200 --> 24:47.800
VERY APPEALING.

24:47.800 --> 24:49.600
DURING AN ECLIPSE,

24:49.600 --> 24:51.400
DON'T DO THIS.

24:51.400 --> 24:55.767
BUDDY, THIS CAN'T BE THAT HARD.

24:55.767 --> 24:57.166
NAZIS BAD.

24:57.166 --> 25:02.934
ONE FISH, TWO FISH, RED FISH,

25:02.934 --> 25:04.834
ARM OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH THAT

25:04.834 --> 25:05.767
SHOULD OPERATE FREE FROM WHITE

25:05.767 --> 25:07.133
HOUSE INTERFERENCE SO AS TO

25:07.133 --> 25:09.166
AVOID POLITICALLY MOTIVATED

25:09.166 --> 25:11.033
PROSECUTION.

25:11.033 --> 25:13.367
DONALD?

25:13.367 --> 25:14.800
DONALD?

25:14.800 --> 25:15.567
I DON'T THINK HE'S GETTING

25:15.567 --> 25:17.033
ANY OF THIS.

25:17.033 --> 25:17.800
THAT'S ALL FOR NOW, DONALD.

25:17.800 --> 25:19.000
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.834
AND REMEMBER, IF YOU'RE NOT

25:20.834 --> 25:22.300
ENJOYING THIS, THERE'S NO SHAME

25:22.300 --> 25:27.934
IN QUITTING.

25:27.934 --> 25:29.333
>> John: MOVING ON, BEFORE WE

25:29.333 --> 25:31.100
GO, AS THIS IS OUR LAST EPISODE

25:31.100 --> 25:32.200
OF THE YEAR, WE WANTED TO THANK

25:32.200 --> 25:33.600
YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

25:33.600 --> 25:34.233
WE'VE HAD A LOT OF FUN

25:34.233 --> 25:35.100
THIS SEASON.

25:35.100 --> 25:36.400
WE DIDN'T JUST COVER TRUMP.

25:36.400 --> 25:37.667
WE ALSO TRANSFORMED THIS DESK

25:37.667 --> 25:38.700
INTO A BISTRO FOR OUR PIECE

25:38.700 --> 25:40.200
ON THE FRENCH ELECTION.

25:40.200 --> 25:41.867
I MET THE DALAI LAMA AND GAVE

25:41.867 --> 25:43.266
HIM A CALCULATOR WATCH.

25:43.266 --> 25:44.600
WE INTRODUCED YOU TO THE

25:44.600 --> 25:46.900
BOLIVIAN TRAFFIC ZEBRAS,

25:46.900 --> 25:48.767
AND YOU USED OUR GREENSCREEN

25:48.767 --> 25:49.867
VERSION TO PUT IT IN THINGS

25:49.867 --> 25:51.633
FROM "MAD MAX: FURY ROAD

25:51.633 --> 25:53.200
TO "BASIC INSTINCT"

25:53.200 --> 25:54.033
TO ABSOLUTELY FILLING

25:54.033 --> 25:54.967
THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS ROOM

25:54.967 --> 25:58.033
WITH THEM.

25:58.033 --> 25:58.900
THANK YOU SO MUCH

25:58.900 --> 26:00.066
FOR TAKING PART.

26:00.066 --> 26:01.200
WE ALSO HAD WEIRD AL SING A SONG

26:01.200 --> 26:02.133
ABOUT NORTH KOREA.

26:02.133 --> 26:04.767
WE HAD PENGUINS,

26:04.767 --> 26:05.567
WE HAD ALLIGATOR STATUES,

26:05.567 --> 26:11.166
LOBSTER SUPREME COURT JUSTICES,

26:11.166 --> 26:16.600
AND WE HAD 5-WAX PRESIDENTS.

26:16.600 --> 26:17.333
WE STOLE ALEX JONES'S BUSINESS

26:17.333 --> 26:17.967
MODEL AND SOLD MILLION-DOLLAR

26:17.967 --> 26:18.633
TAINT WIPES WITH A BLEACH-BLOND

26:18.633 --> 26:19.900
DOCTOR.

26:19.900 --> 26:21.000
WE OUT-MUGGED AJIT PAI WITH

26:21.000 --> 26:24.200
THIS GLORIOUS MONSTROSITY,

26:24.200 --> 26:26.500
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE EXPOSED

26:26.500 --> 26:29.000
THE OLSEN TWIN FOR THE FRAUD

26:29.000 --> 26:29.934
THAT SHE IS:

26:29.934 --> 26:30.934
ONE PERSON MOVING

26:30.934 --> 26:31.734
VERY QUICKLY TO TRICK

26:31.734 --> 26:32.800
THE HUMAN EYE.

26:32.800 --> 26:33.533
WE ACTUALLY --

26:33.533 --> 26:36.066
AND THIS IS TRUE --

26:36.066 --> 26:38.033
INVITED "THEM" TO BE ON THE SHOW

26:38.033 --> 26:39.166
TONIGHT TO PROVE ME WRONG.

26:39.166 --> 26:41.133
BUT APPARENTLY, "THEY"

26:41.133 --> 26:42.567
COULDN'T MAKE IT.

26:42.567 --> 26:43.900
AND AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,

26:43.900 --> 26:45.033
THAT IS TANTAMOUNT TO AN

26:45.033 --> 26:47.033
ADMISSION, SO I'M MAKING IT

26:47.033 --> 26:48.500
OFFICIAL.

26:48.500 --> 26:49.834
WE GOT HER!
