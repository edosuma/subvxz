but I'm warning you,

-I'm gonna have burger envy.
-Michael: Yeah?

You know, you can get
this without cheese.

01:25.585 --> 01:27.504

No, but I-I love you kids.
What are you gonna eat, Sammy?

01:35.512 --> 01:37.138
Okay. Well, maybe I'll
start with some coffee.

01:37.222 --> 01:38.681

So that means
Bloody Marys then?

01:38.765 --> 01:41.184
You can get Bloody Marys.
We're all together.
This is a big one.

He-he tricked me
into it last time,

01:50.360 --> 01:52.904
so I... I don't know.
I gotta think about it.

01:52.987 --> 01:56.115
-How is everything?
-So good.

01:56.199 --> 01:57.992
Thank you, sir. Ma'am.

the first time.
Alright, beat it.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.551
I am gonna stay
and finish my coffee.

02:14.634 --> 02:16.719
-Me, too.
-Michael: Oh.

02:19.013 --> 02:21.432
-Good to see you, Sam.
-Yeah, good to see you, Mike.

02:23.518 --> 02:27.981
You know, I didn't know this was
gonna be, like, a whole thing.

02:28.064 --> 02:30.108
-What, brunch?
-Yeah, it's kinda like

02:30.191 --> 02:31.776
a non-sanctioned group activity.

02:31.860 --> 02:33.695
There's only four of us.

02:33.778 --> 02:35.864
I... How'd I do?

02:35.947 --> 02:38.491
-I think you did well.
-(phone vibrating)

02:38.575 --> 02:41.244
Oh, my fucking sister.

02:41.327 --> 02:43.037
Hi.

02:43.121 --> 02:45.039
When I get there.

02:45.123 --> 02:46.374
Alright.

02:46.457 --> 02:50.086
You know what?
I, uh, I have to go by
my sister's store.

02:50.169 --> 02:52.839
-Oh, do you wanna
walk with me?
-Sure.

02:52.922 --> 02:55.216
Okay. Oh, Fred left
a lot of money.

02:55.300 --> 02:56.968
He's like a big tipper, huh?

02:57.051 --> 02:59.262
Yeah, especially for waiters
who feel uncomfortable.

02:59.345 --> 03:01.764
What does he teach, anyway?

03:01.848 --> 03:03.558
He's really big
into farmy stuff.

03:03.641 --> 03:06.144
He's the head
of the entire...

03:06.227 --> 03:08.521

Dirt Department?

would love that one.
-Yep.

I need you Monday night.

03:49.187 --> 03:50.813

03:50.897 --> 03:52.190
We have our event
coming up for Crazy Dayz.

and I really need you

03:54.150 --> 03:55.276

03:55.360 --> 03:57.362
By the way,
who would've thought this one

03:57.445 --> 03:59.280
would have such
beautiful handwriting?

03:59.364 --> 04:00.949

-Tricia: Yeah?

04:01.032 --> 04:03.743

exactly that spirit.

-No, you don't have
to be gay to go.

a church friend, so...
-Well, still,

11:44.078 --> 11:45.204

would be nice.

Reshma's invite yet?

24:11.741 --> 24:13.869
I just... couldn't do it.

24:15.704 --> 24:17.164
Why?

24:19.082 --> 24:21.001
Because I didn't think that...

24:23.712 --> 24:26.131
Because I didn't
think I was any good.

24:27.507 --> 24:30.510
-At singing?
-(sighs)

24:32.053 --> 24:33.680
Everything, Joel.

24:37.517 --> 24:39.686
I don't think I'm any good.

24:41.980 --> 24:44.107
So, um, you know...

24:46.067 --> 24:48.028
I'm really sorry
I hurt your feelings,

24:48.111 --> 24:49.988
but I don't think maybe
you'd wanna do all this.

24:50.071 --> 24:52.282
You know, I-I don't know if
I'm really friend material,

24:52.365 --> 24:55.076
-so just...
-You're overthinking that.

24:57.287 --> 24:59.956
I think you're gonna surprise
yourself. Just don't...

25:01.082 --> 25:03.251
You know, just...

25:03.335 --> 25:05.921
-Eh.
-(laughs)

25:06.004 --> 25:07.589
Just... eh?

25:07.672 --> 25:09.925
(both laugh)

25:10.008 --> 25:13.762
In my mind, it was a little
manlier, but yeah. Just meh.

25:13.845 --> 25:17.182
-(laughs) Show me again.
-(laughs)

25:17.265 --> 25:20.101
-Just meh.
-Meh. (laughs)

25:22.229 --> 25:24.481
-Okay.
-We're gonna be okay.

25:26.399 --> 25:28.151
-Okay.
-You wanna do some Zumba?

25:29.402 --> 25:32.322
-No. (laughs)
-(laughs)

25:33.240 --> 25:36.076
Eh, fair. (laughs)

25:36.159 --> 25:38.036
I mean...

25:38.119 --> 25:40.288
(tough voice):
If that's what it takes
to get you back, I'll try it.

25:40.372 --> 25:42.207
(laughs) Oh my god,
you do owe me.

25:42.290 --> 25:44.251
-(normal voice): Oh, fuck!
I didn't mean it!
-Come on!

25:44.334 --> 25:47.128
(music resumes)

25:47.212 --> 25:48.672
Okay. You're gonna
be good at something,

25:48.755 --> 25:49.965
and it's gonna be Zumba.

25:50.048 --> 25:52.300
-Fuck you.
-(laughs)

25:53.051 --> 25:54.469
One, two, three, four.

25:54.552 --> 25:56.471
Both:
One, two, three, eh!

25:56.554 --> 25:57.806
One, two, three, eh!

25:57.889 --> 25:59.975
Both:
One, two, three, eh!
