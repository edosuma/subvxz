00:05.880 --> 00:09.008
(circular saw grinding)

00:12.470 --> 00:15.640
(grinding pauses, restarts)

00:17.600 --> 00:20.729
(grinding continues)

00:21.354 --> 00:23.565
Hey! Hey!

00:23.648 --> 00:26.526
-(grinding stops)
-It's a little bit early
to be doing that, isn't it?

00:26.609 --> 00:29.654
Sorry! Sorry. Almost done.

00:29.738 --> 00:31.072
It's, uh...

00:31.156 --> 00:32.782
it's 12:30.

00:33.783 --> 00:34.743
Fuck, really?

00:36.411 --> 00:37.912
Yeah.

00:40.248 --> 00:41.791
Nice underpants.

00:44.669 --> 00:46.588
Oh. Um...

00:47.547 --> 00:49.257
-They're my mom's.
-Oh.

00:49.340 --> 00:51.342
Vintage.

00:51.426 --> 00:54.095
She has great taste.

00:54.179 --> 00:56.306
She's a shopper. (laughs)

00:56.389 --> 00:58.558
(door opens, shuts)

00:58.641 --> 01:01.770
(light theme playing)

01:07.442 --> 01:10.153
Sammy! Over here!

01:10.236 --> 01:11.780
-Have a seat.
-Michael: Hey.

01:11.863 --> 01:14.282
-Hi. Sorry I'm late.
-Joel: It's okay.

01:14.365 --> 01:16.284
-Fred: Join us.
-(cafe chatter)

01:16.367 --> 01:18.995
Okay. What's everybody gettin'?

01:19.078 --> 01:21.164
I'm gonna order the eggs,
but I'm warning you,

01:21.247 --> 01:23.583
-I'm gonna have burger envy.
-Michael: Yeah?

01:23.666 --> 01:25.502
Joel:
You know, you can get
this without cheese.

01:25.585 --> 01:27.504
-Okay.
-'Cause of your tummy.

01:27.587 --> 01:29.923
You really
say "tummy"?

01:30.006 --> 01:33.134
-What do you call it?
-Stomach!

01:33.218 --> 01:35.428
No, but I-I love you kids.
What are you gonna eat, Sammy?

01:35.512 --> 01:37.138
Okay. Well, maybe I'll
start with some coffee.

01:37.222 --> 01:38.681
Michael:
So that means
Bloody Marys then?

01:38.765 --> 01:41.184
You can get Bloody Marys.
We're all together.
This is a big one.

01:41.267 --> 01:44.687
(laughter)

01:44.771 --> 01:47.649
So, what are you going to
sing next choir practice?

01:47.732 --> 01:50.276
You know, I don't know.
He-he tricked me
into it last time,

01:50.360 --> 01:52.904
so I... I don't know.
I gotta think about it.

01:52.987 --> 01:56.115
-How is everything?
-So good.

01:56.199 --> 01:57.992
Thank you, sir. Ma'am.

01:58.076 --> 02:00.787
Hey, you got it right
the first time.
Alright, beat it.

02:00.870 --> 02:02.121
(laughs)

02:02.205 --> 02:04.332
-Ai-yi-yi. Alright.
-(phone buzzing)

02:04.415 --> 02:07.293
I said it was on me,
and you're cleaning me out.

02:07.377 --> 02:09.504
-But it has been
my absolute pleasure.
-(Michael laughing)

02:09.587 --> 02:10.839
Anyone else leaving?

02:10.922 --> 02:11.881
Yeah.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.551
I am gonna stay
and finish my coffee.

02:14.634 --> 02:16.719
-Me, too.
-Michael: Oh.

02:19.013 --> 02:21.432
-Good to see you, Sam.
-Yeah, good to see you, Mike.

02:23.518 --> 02:27.981
You know, I didn't know this was
gonna be, like, a whole thing.

02:28.064 --> 02:30.108
-What, brunch?
-Yeah, it's kinda like

02:30.191 --> 02:31.776
a non-sanctioned group activity.

02:31.860 --> 02:33.695
There's only four of us.

02:33.778 --> 02:35.864
I... How'd I do?

02:35.947 --> 02:38.491
-I think you did well.
-(phone vibrating)

02:38.575 --> 02:41.244
Oh, my fucking sister.

02:41.327 --> 02:43.037
Hi.

02:43.121 --> 02:45.039
When I get there.

02:45.123 --> 02:46.374
Alright.

02:46.457 --> 02:50.086
You know what?
I, uh, I have to go by
my sister's store.

02:50.169 --> 02:52.839
-Oh, do you wanna
walk with me?
-Sure.

02:52.922 --> 02:55.216
Okay. Oh, Fred left
a lot of money.

02:55.300 --> 02:56.968
He's like a big tipper, huh?

02:57.051 --> 02:59.262
Yeah, especially for waiters
who feel uncomfortable.

02:59.345 --> 03:01.764
What does he teach, anyway?

03:01.848 --> 03:03.558
He's really big
into farmy stuff.

03:03.641 --> 03:06.144
He's the head
of the entire...

03:06.227 --> 03:08.521
I wanna say
Dirt Department?

03:08.605 --> 03:10.148
-(laughs)
-Huh.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.692
Well, this is me.

03:15.111 --> 03:18.156
-Oh. Are you coming in?
-Sure!

03:18.239 --> 03:20.408
Okay, well, if you like
knickknacks and doodads,

03:20.491 --> 03:22.160
you're gonna love this place.

03:22.243 --> 03:23.369
(door bell ringing)

03:26.915 --> 03:29.500
-(plastic crinkling)
-I've never figured out
who buys this shit.

03:29.584 --> 03:31.294
Oh, totally.

03:31.377 --> 03:33.463
-Joel! Hi!
-(Joel laughs)

03:33.546 --> 03:36.382
-Joel: Hey, Tricia.
-I didn't know you
two were friends.

03:36.466 --> 03:39.677
Cute.
Oh, cardamom.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.304
-We both said that you
would love that one.
-Yep.

03:41.387 --> 03:44.349
Oh. Thank you, Charity.
You know me well. (laughs)

03:44.432 --> 03:46.434
-(whispers): Do you have
a house account here?
-No...

03:46.517 --> 03:47.602
Good.

03:47.685 --> 03:49.103
I need you Monday night.

03:49.187 --> 03:50.813
I need your handwriting.

03:50.897 --> 03:52.190
We have our event
coming up for Crazy Dayz.

03:52.273 --> 03:54.067
It's really important,
and I really need you

03:54.150 --> 03:55.276
for the invitations.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.362
By the way,
who would've thought this one

03:57.445 --> 03:59.280
would have such
beautiful handwriting?

03:59.364 --> 04:00.949
-Joel: I would.
-Tricia: Yeah?

04:01.032 --> 04:03.743
-Can you?
-Sure.

04:03.826 --> 04:06.829
Great. Please bring
exactly that spirit.

04:08.206 --> 04:10.792
-And thank you!
-Sam: Yep.

04:10.875 --> 04:12.877
Okay, you ready?

04:12.961 --> 04:15.380
I-I don't need this.

04:15.463 --> 04:18.841
-(door bell ringing)
-I always do that.
I always roll over for her.

04:18.925 --> 04:20.218
Oh, hey, Rick.

04:20.301 --> 04:22.095
-Hey, Sam.
-How you doing?

04:23.846 --> 04:27.517
(whispers):
Oh my god. I almost forgot that
I saw him at choir practice!

04:27.600 --> 04:29.519
Oh yeah. I've seen
him there before.

04:29.602 --> 04:31.479
Wait, what?

04:31.562 --> 04:33.064
What?

04:33.147 --> 04:35.566
Oh my god! Is Rick gay?

04:35.650 --> 04:38.987
-No, you don't have
to be gay to go.
-I know, but...

04:39.070 --> 04:41.239
Something's going on.

04:41.322 --> 04:44.158
(truck brakes squeak,
engine cuts)

04:50.206 --> 04:53.543
Hey! You found
your pants.

04:53.626 --> 04:55.420
Sam:
Oh. (laughs)

04:55.503 --> 04:57.714
Yeah, I'm, um, mixin' it up.

04:57.797 --> 04:59.132
(car door shuts)

05:03.803 --> 05:05.388
How's it going?

05:08.808 --> 05:10.351
I've seen you come
and go for a year,

05:10.435 --> 05:12.353
and you never said
"hi" till this morning.

05:13.104 --> 05:14.647
Yeah, um...

05:15.440 --> 05:16.816
Well,

05:16.899 --> 05:19.068
I guess I'm trying out
being a people-person.

05:19.152 --> 05:22.030
-How's that working for you?
-(scoffs) I'm not sure.

05:22.113 --> 05:24.323
(both laugh)

05:26.159 --> 05:27.452
I like your trellis.

05:27.535 --> 05:29.787
Oh. (scoffs) Thanks.

05:29.871 --> 05:32.707
I was gonna espalier
a Bougainvillea,

05:32.790 --> 05:35.001
-but they go to
shit in the cold.
-Um,

05:35.084 --> 05:38.337
well, I have,
if you're interested,

05:38.421 --> 05:40.089
a pile of dirt and sticks.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.091
I'm kinda in
the planning stages.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.551
-Oh, cool.
-(laughs)

05:43.634 --> 05:45.762
I'm just kidding.
I can't keep anything
alive over here.

05:45.845 --> 05:47.513
-(laughs)
-Like Holly.

05:47.597 --> 05:51.059
-(gasps) Oh my god!
-Shit. Uh, too far.

05:51.142 --> 05:52.351
She had a dark sense of humor,
so I thought--

05:52.435 --> 05:53.811
No, she did. No, it's fine.

05:53.895 --> 05:56.105
-It's okay, I just did
not see that coming.
-Are you sure?

05:56.189 --> 05:58.066
-(sighs)
-Yeah. (laughs)

05:58.149 --> 06:00.151
I really-- I really liked her.

06:00.234 --> 06:02.612
-Yeah. She's pretty great.
-Yeah.

06:03.988 --> 06:06.199
Um, well...

06:07.241 --> 06:10.495
My name is Sam.

06:11.329 --> 06:14.082
My name is Drew.

06:14.165 --> 06:15.541
D-R-E-W Drew?

06:15.625 --> 06:17.251
That's all four letters.

06:17.335 --> 06:19.962
-All four. Like "fuck."
-Yeah. (laughs)

06:20.046 --> 06:22.799
Oh my god. You know, this has
really been nice talking to you.

06:22.882 --> 06:25.301
-Nice talking to you.
-Probably won't
happen again, but...

06:25.384 --> 06:27.595
-Alright, have a good life.
-Yeah. (laughs)

06:28.221 --> 06:29.764
You, too.

06:29.847 --> 06:33.434
-I'm gonna go make
myself a sandwich.
-Enjoy that.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.686
(mouthing)

06:37.605 --> 06:39.774
â™ª â™ª

06:39.857 --> 06:43.194
(birds chirping)

06:57.834 --> 06:59.210
(sighs)

07:05.091 --> 07:07.218
(glass clinking)

07:10.096 --> 07:12.515
-(sighs)
-Leftovers or go wild

07:12.598 --> 07:15.977
and crack open the chicken
pot pies in the deep freeze?

07:16.060 --> 07:19.147
-Uh, pot pies sound good.
-Okay. Okie-dokie.

07:22.692 --> 07:24.986
â™ª â™ª

07:30.116 --> 07:31.659
(clears throat)

07:39.208 --> 07:41.210
(whispers):
Whatcha looking at?

07:41.294 --> 07:42.795
Oh, nothing.

08:01.355 --> 08:05.026
Do you even know what your daily
quota for essays graded is?

08:05.651 --> 08:07.278
Uh, I-I don't.

08:07.361 --> 08:10.072
-And how many essays
have you graded today?
-Sam: Um...

08:11.449 --> 08:13.034
You know, I can't remember
the exact number--

08:13.117 --> 08:14.702
She didn't even
look at her folder.

08:14.785 --> 08:17.330
I'm moving you over
to Monica's team.

08:17.413 --> 08:19.540
M-Mon-- Team?

08:19.624 --> 08:21.959
What, are you a supervisor?

08:22.043 --> 08:26.047
Just, like, think of it as more
of a mentor-mentee situation.

08:26.130 --> 08:28.674
-(scoffs)
-I know it's...

08:28.758 --> 08:31.093
-Can I...
-Go ahead. Make it yours.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.013
I have been there.

08:34.096 --> 08:36.098
I have stood
where you're standing,

08:36.182 --> 08:38.309
and been like,
"Is this it?"

08:38.392 --> 08:41.062
And, like... Okay,
so there's this one song

08:41.145 --> 08:42.772
that came out when I was in,
like, middle school,

08:42.855 --> 08:45.233
and it starts out,
"Do you ever feel

08:45.316 --> 08:47.109
like a plastic bag..."

08:48.152 --> 08:50.071
At least when
I was bartending,

08:50.154 --> 08:53.616
make a little cash,
drink on the job.

08:53.699 --> 08:55.785
Nobody bothered me.

08:55.868 --> 08:57.161
I don't care about this job!

08:57.245 --> 08:59.622
I don't wanna care
about this job!

08:59.705 --> 09:01.624
And fucking Monica!

09:02.583 --> 09:04.627
Joel, I'm sorry...

09:04.710 --> 09:06.754
What do you with
the cookie parts?

09:07.880 --> 09:09.257
Oh.

09:12.426 --> 09:13.511
Oh! (laughs)

09:13.594 --> 09:16.430
-Nice!
-Here. It's really
satisfying. Try it.

09:17.473 --> 09:19.016
-Oh!
-(laughs)

09:19.100 --> 09:20.935
-You got an arm on you!
-Thank you so much.

09:21.018 --> 09:24.313
(laughter)

09:24.397 --> 09:26.774
-One more, right?
-Yeah. Oh!

09:26.857 --> 09:29.944
-(laughs)
-Wait, let me see if
I can put it in the hole.

09:30.027 --> 09:31.904
-(clink)
-(both yell)

09:31.988 --> 09:35.074
â™ª â™ª

09:40.288 --> 09:42.415
(brakes creak)

09:43.499 --> 09:44.583
(door opens)

09:45.876 --> 09:47.003
(door shuts)

09:52.842 --> 09:54.927
-Mom: Hey...
-Hi.

09:55.011 --> 09:56.554
I-I didn't hear you come in.

09:56.637 --> 09:59.348
-Sam: Oh, sorry.
-Whatcha doing?

09:59.432 --> 10:03.019
-Um, I was just looking
for some old songbooks.
-Aw.

10:03.102 --> 10:05.813
-That's a nice surprise.
-Yeah.

10:05.896 --> 10:07.648
-Mom: What'd you find?
-Sam: Oh,

10:07.732 --> 10:10.526
so much good stuff.

10:10.609 --> 10:13.279
These American classics
here. (laughs)

10:13.362 --> 10:14.905
Oh yeah.

10:14.989 --> 10:17.742
Okay, well, I'm cleaning
you out. That okay?

10:17.825 --> 10:19.994
They're all yours.

10:20.077 --> 10:21.537
Where's Dad?

10:22.705 --> 10:24.248
Oh, where is Dad?

10:25.333 --> 10:28.085
He's out somewhere
doing somethin'.

10:28.169 --> 10:29.253
(sighs)

10:30.671 --> 10:31.756
(sighs)

10:37.219 --> 10:38.554
Dad!

10:39.930 --> 10:41.223
Dad!

10:43.559 --> 10:44.393
Dad!

10:44.477 --> 10:47.396
-Dad: Sam!
-(banging on metal)

10:47.480 --> 10:48.689
-Sam!
-Dad...

10:48.773 --> 10:51.359
-Jesus Christ.
-Dad: I'm in here!

10:51.442 --> 10:54.820
Dad... Dad!

10:54.904 --> 10:56.989
Oh my god, what happened?
Are you okay?

10:57.073 --> 10:59.408
Yeah, I'm good. I'm good.

10:59.492 --> 11:02.453
The wind blew
the damn door shut.

11:02.536 --> 11:04.038
Look at that handle.

11:04.121 --> 11:06.374
-Jesus.
-Broken right off...

11:07.458 --> 11:08.834
Why didn't you call Mom?

11:08.918 --> 11:10.336
I know.

11:10.419 --> 11:13.422
She's in there passed out
on the recliner, Dad!

11:13.506 --> 11:16.258
It's my fault, not hers.

11:16.342 --> 11:21.013
Look, I-I got careless
with the goddamn door!

11:21.097 --> 11:25.101
-Alright, let's get you inside
and get you something to eat.
-(grunting)

11:25.184 --> 11:27.269
-Mm.
-You gotta be so thirsty.

11:27.353 --> 11:28.938
Yeah, I am thirsty.

11:29.021 --> 11:30.981
(laughs) Oh...

11:31.065 --> 11:34.068
-Sam: What are we
gonna do with you?
-I don't know, sweetheart.

11:36.195 --> 11:39.407
I mean, I'm not doing it
expecting any sort of thank you.

11:39.490 --> 11:41.367
It's just what you do, right?

11:41.450 --> 11:43.994
-And she's
a church friend, so...
-Well, still,

11:44.078 --> 11:45.204
a little thank you
would be nice.

11:45.287 --> 11:47.998
Have you-- Have you done
Reshma's invite yet?

11:48.082 --> 11:50.334
-Um, I don't think so.
-When you get to it, pull it

11:50.418 --> 11:52.128
because I wanna put
a personal note in it.

11:52.211 --> 11:54.630
'Cause she's the one that
we need to get in with

11:54.713 --> 11:56.048
for the Downtown
Business of the Year.

11:56.132 --> 11:58.634
-Got it.
-Coop: Alrighty.

11:58.717 --> 12:00.302
Ew. Coop,

12:00.386 --> 12:02.304
-go sit down.
-(laughs)

12:02.388 --> 12:04.014
-(door shuts)
-Rick: Hey, Coach.

12:04.098 --> 12:05.266
-Coop: Hey, bud.
-Rick: Great game.

12:05.349 --> 12:06.725
-Coop: Thanks, man.
-Tricia: Change.

12:06.809 --> 12:10.771
Yeah. Think they
raised their prices.

12:11.605 --> 12:12.940
My-- Babe, no! I...

12:13.023 --> 12:16.068
Don't want all that grease
by the invitations!

12:16.152 --> 12:18.070
-Hey, Rick.
-Hey, Charity!

12:18.154 --> 12:19.780
(putting down boxes)

12:23.367 --> 12:25.703
That one's not quite perfect.

12:25.786 --> 12:27.705
I put some tits on this one.

12:28.622 --> 12:29.707
(laughs)

12:29.790 --> 12:32.751
-(guns firing on TV)
-Rick: Don't-- Could you...

12:34.211 --> 12:35.963
-Okay, go.
-Clear.

12:36.046 --> 12:38.340
You wanna hop in on this raid?

12:38.424 --> 12:40.634
No, I'll get in
on the next one.

12:43.095 --> 12:45.681
(gunfire continues)

12:45.764 --> 12:48.934
So, uh, work's been
pretty busy, huh?

12:49.018 --> 12:51.228
(inhales) Slow as shit.

12:51.312 --> 12:52.938
Huh.

12:53.022 --> 12:56.150
(gunfire continues)

12:57.735 --> 13:00.237
The chaps are cute.
What's up with that?

13:00.321 --> 13:02.406
Because it's the Wild West.

13:02.490 --> 13:04.283
Oh.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.661
Oh, suck it!

13:07.745 --> 13:10.331
-Come on, man! Come on, man!
-(explosions)

13:10.414 --> 13:11.999
To your left!

13:12.082 --> 13:14.543
Look to your
fucking left!

13:14.627 --> 13:16.545
It's a magic horseshoe!

13:16.629 --> 13:19.548
(indistinct whispering)

13:19.632 --> 13:20.883
Shh, shh, shh...

13:20.966 --> 13:22.343
Charity/Tricia:
Hey.

13:22.426 --> 13:23.886
(both sigh)

13:23.969 --> 13:26.138
-Whatcha doing?
-Uh, you know what, I'm gonna...

13:26.222 --> 13:29.600
go to Joel's, so I'll just
finish up here and hit the road.

13:29.683 --> 13:31.268
So, you and Joel...

13:31.352 --> 13:34.605
You guys just friends,
or what's going on?

13:34.688 --> 13:36.649
Yeah. We're just friends.

13:36.732 --> 13:39.860
Uh, it sounds like the testing
center is going really good.

13:39.944 --> 13:41.529
Yeah, it's okay.

13:42.696 --> 13:44.698
It's just really good
to have you back.

13:44.782 --> 13:46.867
You know, you're getting
your life on track.

13:46.951 --> 13:50.204
That's great.
You have a good job.
Maybe a boyfriend.

13:50.287 --> 13:51.497
I don't know, maybe the gym.

13:52.623 --> 13:55.543
It's just really good, Sam.

13:55.626 --> 13:57.545
-Yeah, I'm gonna
go to the bathroom.
-Charity: Oh,

13:57.628 --> 14:00.089
uh, Coop's in there,
so it's gonna be a while.

14:00.172 --> 14:03.592
-Coop (muffled):
Gonna be a while.
-Charity: Oh, but Joel said

14:03.676 --> 14:05.844
that you're gonna be
eligible for benefits soon.

14:05.928 --> 14:07.096
That's exciting.

14:07.179 --> 14:09.932
Now, is that... is that
dental and vision, too?

14:10.015 --> 14:13.727
I mean,
what is this, Charity?
And why do you care?

14:13.811 --> 14:17.064
-Well, I just...
-And why are you guys
talking about me?

14:17.147 --> 14:19.441
Just calm down, Sam.
I mean,

14:19.525 --> 14:21.527
we are just trying to help.

14:21.610 --> 14:25.322
I don't know when
you got so defensive!
It's all the time!

14:25.406 --> 14:27.658
I mean, you would never
be biting Holly's head off

14:27.741 --> 14:30.369
-like you're doing mine if she
was trying to give you advice--
-No, no, no.

14:30.452 --> 14:31.704
Leave her out of this!

14:32.329 --> 14:33.414
Oh my god.

14:33.497 --> 14:35.082
What, are you not embarrassed
by her anymore?

14:35.165 --> 14:36.250
Is it just me now?

14:36.333 --> 14:38.419
I was never embarrassed by her!
I never said that!

14:38.502 --> 14:40.462
You didn't have to!

14:40.546 --> 14:41.505
(sighs)

14:41.589 --> 14:42.965
You know what, Sam?

14:43.048 --> 14:45.968
I don't know when you think
that real life starts,

14:46.051 --> 14:49.054
but you are well over 40.

14:49.138 --> 14:50.556
So, you're past the point.

14:50.639 --> 14:53.559
-Real life's happening
right now. Okay?
-Okay. You know what?

14:53.642 --> 14:55.853
-I gotta go. I gotta go!
-You gotta go. Yeah.
I know, I figured.

14:55.936 --> 14:57.062
I know how you do.

14:57.146 --> 14:58.314
Typical.

14:58.397 --> 14:59.690
Charity:
We just...

14:59.773 --> 15:03.819
-want what's best for you.
-Sam: (sighs) Fuck you, Charity.

15:03.902 --> 15:05.029
(slams door)

15:12.995 --> 15:14.246
Hello.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.540
Sorry I'm late.
I had a little run-in
with my sister.

15:16.624 --> 15:20.002
-Oh.
-But I got some music,
and I got some beer.

15:20.085 --> 15:21.670
(laughs) Well,

15:21.754 --> 15:24.632
come in, come in,
come in. Please.

15:24.715 --> 15:26.842
Sam:
Alright, ladies first.

15:26.925 --> 15:29.678
Well then, why am I not first?

15:29.762 --> 15:32.848
(sighs) Roberta Flack
and Crystal Gayle?

15:32.931 --> 15:35.517
My god, I'm gonna faint.
(laughs)

15:37.353 --> 15:39.271
-Joel...
-Huh?

15:40.356 --> 15:42.191
Is that a dream board?

15:43.525 --> 15:45.235
No.

15:45.319 --> 15:46.820
Oh...

15:46.904 --> 15:49.198
-It's a vision board.
-Okay.

15:52.701 --> 15:54.411
Wow.

15:57.915 --> 16:00.334
You really spent
some time on this.

16:00.417 --> 16:03.629
-It's not...
-You're gonna go to Paris,
you got an Eiffel Tower there.

16:03.712 --> 16:06.340
-Well, just Europe.
I wanna go to Europe.
-Sam: Okay.

16:06.423 --> 16:08.509
Oh, and then, of course, uh...

16:08.592 --> 16:10.719
everybody's hands in a heart.

16:10.803 --> 16:13.931
-Community.
-Uh-huh. Great.

16:14.014 --> 16:17.059
What's that?
A blender or something?

16:17.142 --> 16:18.185
It's a Vitamix. I just...

16:18.268 --> 16:19.853
I really wanna have
a nice kitchen.

16:19.937 --> 16:22.189
Sam:
And-- Oh, what's
this one? Is this...

16:22.272 --> 16:24.525
you and Michael and your
nine adopted kids, or what?

16:24.608 --> 16:26.527
-It's not nine. It's six.
-Oh.

16:26.610 --> 16:28.195
And four of them
are adopted, yes.

16:28.278 --> 16:29.905
Okay.

16:29.988 --> 16:33.951
And you wanna do all of
this here, in-in Kansas?

16:36.412 --> 16:39.456
-Yeah. This is where I live.
-Oh.

16:39.540 --> 16:42.376
Family. Prayer circles.

16:42.459 --> 16:44.461
Fucking pots with
cactus and shit--

16:44.545 --> 16:47.089
I mean, what is wrong with this?
What's wrong with this?

16:47.172 --> 16:50.426
I-I'm dreaming about the future.
This is what I want.

16:50.509 --> 16:52.094
Well, I mean,

16:52.177 --> 16:54.221
dream all you want,
Joel, but...

16:54.304 --> 16:55.514
this is the future.

16:55.597 --> 16:57.474
We're in our 40s,

16:57.558 --> 17:00.269
and it hasn't
happened yet, has it?

17:00.352 --> 17:03.439
It hasn't happened for you.
It hasn't happened for me.

17:03.522 --> 17:05.899
And that's because
it's not going to happen.

17:05.983 --> 17:08.736
And it's definitely not
going to happen here.

17:09.653 --> 17:10.904
I mean,

17:10.988 --> 17:12.656
keep cutting up
your pictures, but...

17:13.490 --> 17:15.617
that's the way it is.

17:18.829 --> 17:21.165
We deserve to be happy.

17:23.625 --> 17:25.169
Well...

17:25.252 --> 17:26.754
I'm not sure.

17:28.213 --> 17:29.798
I don't know.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.385
Know what?

17:34.678 --> 17:36.054
I think I should go.

17:36.138 --> 17:38.807
-Don't go.
-I'm gonna go.

17:39.725 --> 17:42.060
-Don't leave!
-I gotta go.

17:42.144 --> 17:45.272
(door opens, shuts)

17:45.355 --> 17:48.650
(light piano playing)

18:29.191 --> 18:31.276
â™ª â™ª

18:51.421 --> 18:53.549
(brakes creaking)

18:56.802 --> 18:58.136
(engine cuts)

19:14.111 --> 19:15.362
(sighs)

19:15.445 --> 19:18.407
-Sam? I thought that was you!
-(door shuts)

19:18.490 --> 19:22.369
-Hey, Kim.
-Come on in.

19:22.452 --> 19:24.788
No, I-I don't wanna bother you.

19:29.251 --> 19:30.836
So...

19:30.919 --> 19:32.337
-you bought the boat.
-(laughs)

19:32.421 --> 19:35.674
-It's cool. You guys
always talked about that.
-Yep.

19:36.633 --> 19:38.927
Uh, I gotta tune the motor,

19:39.011 --> 19:41.471
otherwise I'd take
you out on it.

19:41.555 --> 19:43.807
-Rain check?
-Yeah, I'd love that.

19:45.976 --> 19:47.811
How you doin', Sam?

19:47.895 --> 19:49.354
I'm good.

19:52.149 --> 19:53.692
No, I'm not. (laughs)

19:54.818 --> 19:56.236
You know how...

19:58.238 --> 20:00.073
Holly always said...

20:01.658 --> 20:02.951
"Just give it some time, Sam.

20:03.035 --> 20:05.495
You're gonna be so
happy you're here."

20:08.790 --> 20:09.958
I'm not.

20:13.170 --> 20:15.297
I just...

20:15.380 --> 20:19.468
I just can't seem to get
comfortable here without her.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.139
And I feel a little lost.

20:29.311 --> 20:31.188
It's hard.

20:31.271 --> 20:32.856
It's so hard.

20:32.940 --> 20:35.442
I couldn't get out of bed
at first, but eventually--

20:35.525 --> 20:37.778
-(door opens)
-Hi. Uh, sorry.

20:37.861 --> 20:39.947
Uh, the internet's
out again, babe.

20:40.030 --> 20:42.532
Unplug the router
and plug it back in.

20:42.616 --> 20:43.825
It's being weird.

20:47.871 --> 20:50.040
-(door shuts)
-I know.

20:51.541 --> 20:53.460
I miss her every day,

20:53.543 --> 20:56.171
but I'm trying to do
the things that make me happy.

20:57.381 --> 20:59.341
It doesn't
always work,

20:59.424 --> 21:01.259
but I'm trying.

21:01.343 --> 21:03.428
You know, just...

21:05.138 --> 21:06.890
buy the boat.

21:10.143 --> 21:11.770
Buy the boat.

21:15.232 --> 21:16.400
Thank you, Kim.

21:17.901 --> 21:19.194
Thank you.

21:22.864 --> 21:25.367
I'm gonna hit you up,
and we're gonna take that ride.

21:25.450 --> 21:28.286
-Promise?
-Yes.

21:28.370 --> 21:31.456
â™ª â™ª

21:35.794 --> 21:37.963
-(door opens)
-Mary Jo: Goddammit...

21:39.006 --> 21:41.925
Ed! I'm going to
the grocery store!

21:42.801 --> 21:45.721
(door opens, shuts)

21:45.804 --> 21:47.931
-(car revving)
-Ed: MJ!

21:48.807 --> 21:50.892
Shi-- Damn it!

21:50.976 --> 21:54.021
-Come on, MJ, let me drive!
-Oh, stop!

21:54.104 --> 21:55.897
-(bones crack)
-Ah, Jesus!

21:57.315 --> 22:00.444
(muffled music blasting)

22:04.698 --> 22:07.826
(music continues)

22:10.454 --> 22:14.082
â™ª Baby, come on,
give me the feeling,
you give me the love â™ª

22:14.166 --> 22:16.251
Joel, are you in there?

22:16.334 --> 22:18.045
(door creaking)

22:18.128 --> 22:21.298
("Dale Fuego" by Edalam playing)

22:33.602 --> 22:35.187
Can we talk?

22:36.354 --> 22:37.898
I'm busy.

22:38.982 --> 22:40.567
Please.

22:44.488 --> 22:46.615
(shuts off music)

22:51.745 --> 22:52.913
(sniffles)

22:56.500 --> 23:00.170
I'm sorry I came over here
and shat all over your dreams.
(laughs)

23:01.171 --> 23:02.839
Sam...

23:02.923 --> 23:05.634
-it really hurt my feelings.
-I'm sorry.

23:12.349 --> 23:14.351
It's just that...

23:14.434 --> 23:16.978
You have everything so...

23:17.687 --> 23:18.897
mapped out.

23:18.980 --> 23:20.315
It's so clear to you,

23:20.398 --> 23:23.985
exactly what you need to do to
be happy, and for me, it just...

23:26.446 --> 23:29.282
I can't... I can't
figure it out. I don't...

23:31.201 --> 23:33.620
I don't know what
it's gonna take.

23:33.703 --> 23:35.122
Sam,

23:35.205 --> 23:37.749
singing makes
you happy.

23:37.833 --> 23:40.335
Yeah, it makes me happy.

23:40.418 --> 23:42.587
But, it also
breaks my heart.

23:45.799 --> 23:47.300
Really?

23:53.348 --> 23:55.058
You know...

23:58.145 --> 23:59.896
A long time ago,
Holly gave me money

23:59.980 --> 24:02.858
so I could record
some songs, and, um...

24:04.734 --> 24:06.903
she knew that would
make me happy.

24:08.280 --> 24:11.658
But, every time she asked to
hear them, I wouldn't let her.

24:11.741 --> 24:13.869
I just... couldn't do it.

24:15.704 --> 24:17.164
Why?

24:19.082 --> 24:21.001
Because I didn't think that...

24:23.712 --> 24:26.131
Because I didn't
think I was any good.

24:27.507 --> 24:30.510
-At singing?
-(sighs)

24:32.053 --> 24:33.680
Everything, Joel.

24:37.517 --> 24:39.686
I don't think I'm any good.

24:41.980 --> 24:44.107
So, um, you know...

24:46.067 --> 24:48.028
I'm really sorry
I hurt your feelings,

24:48.111 --> 24:49.988
but I don't think maybe
you'd wanna do all this.

24:50.071 --> 24:52.282
You know, I-I don't know if
I'm really friend material,

24:52.365 --> 24:55.076
-so just...
-You're overthinking that.

24:57.287 --> 24:59.956
I think you're gonna surprise
yourself. Just don't...

25:01.082 --> 25:03.251
You know, just...

25:03.335 --> 25:05.921
-Eh.
-(laughs)

25:06.004 --> 25:07.589
Just... eh?

25:07.672 --> 25:09.925
(both laugh)

25:10.008 --> 25:13.762
In my mind, it was a little
manlier, but yeah. Just meh.

25:13.845 --> 25:17.182
-(laughs) Show me again.
-(laughs)

25:17.265 --> 25:20.101
-Just meh.
-Meh. (laughs)

25:22.229 --> 25:24.481
-Okay.
-We're gonna be okay.

25:26.399 --> 25:28.151
-Okay.
-You wanna do some Zumba?

25:29.402 --> 25:32.322
-No. (laughs)
-(laughs)

25:33.240 --> 25:36.076
Eh, fair. (laughs)

25:36.159 --> 25:38.036
I mean...

25:38.119 --> 25:40.288
(tough voice):
If that's what it takes
to get you back, I'll try it.

25:40.372 --> 25:42.207
(laughs) Oh my god,
you do owe me.

25:42.290 --> 25:44.251
-(normal voice): Oh, fuck!
I didn't mean it!
-Come on!

25:44.334 --> 25:47.128
(music resumes)

25:47.212 --> 25:48.672
Okay. You're gonna
be good at something,

25:48.755 --> 25:49.965
and it's gonna be Zumba.

25:50.048 --> 25:52.300
-Fuck you.
-(laughs)

25:53.051 --> 25:54.469
One, two, three, four.

25:54.552 --> 25:56.471
Both:
One, two, three, eh!

25:56.554 --> 25:57.806
One, two, three, eh!

25:57.889 --> 25:59.975
Both:
One, two, three, eh!

26:00.058 --> 26:03.436
-(music continues)
-(indistinct chatter, laughter)

26:03.520 --> 26:06.564
â™ª â™ª

27:06.416 --> 27:09.627
(singing continues)

27:12.464 --> 27:14.883
â™ª Baby, come on,
give me the feeling â™ª

27:14.966 --> 27:17.677
â™ª Come give me the love... â™ª
