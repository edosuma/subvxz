[Ernie] Hey guys, we've been bought out!

00:18.810 --> 00:21.771
Sunday 10:00 p.m., mark your calendars.

00:22.188 --> 00:23.523
What does that mean, "bought out"?

00:23.606 --> 00:28.319
We've been hired for a big fancy party
with big fancy Hollywood types.

00:28.653 --> 00:30.947
Four hours,
you all get a hundred bucks plus tips

00:31.031 --> 00:32.782
while you enjoy what I guarantee

00:32.866 --> 00:34.909
will be one of the most interesting nights

00:34.993 --> 00:36.536
-of your life.
-[employees chuckle]

00:36.619 --> 00:39.164
Wait, wait, you're not talking about
a George Cukor party, are you?

00:39.247 --> 00:40.540
-How'd you know?
-Hang on, hang on.

00:40.623 --> 00:42.083
What happens at a George Cukor party?

00:42.167 --> 00:44.127
George is a motion picture director
extraordinaire.

00:44.210 --> 00:48.506
He works very hard, so on Sundays,
just like Yahweh, he likes to kick back.

00:48.590 --> 00:50.717
[chuckling] <i>He invites all kinds of folks!</i>

00:50.800 --> 00:54.387
<i>Writers, directors, agents, producers,</i>
<i>you name it!</i>

00:54.471 --> 00:56.765
<i>Movie stars, like Tallulah Bankhead...</i>

00:56.848 --> 00:59.642
Mr. Hitchcock,
you're a gentleman to say so,

00:59.768 --> 01:03.354
but I can assure you,
I'm as pure as the driven slush.

01:03.438 --> 01:05.440
[all laughing]

01:05.523 --> 01:09.110
[Ernie] <i>...Vivien Leigh, and regular Joes</i>

<i>The stars get French wine,</i>

01:12.655 --> 01:15.742
<i>the guys like us,</i>
<i>we get the swill from California.</i>

01:16.201 --> 01:17.035
Then...

01:17.577 --> 01:19.329
at 10:00, the boys start showing up.

01:19.412 --> 01:21.956
Attention, my dears,
we have some new guests joining us.

01:22.040 --> 01:24.834
[Ernie] <i>Guys trying to make it in the biz.</i>
<i>Pump jockeys, like us.</i>

01:24.918 --> 01:29.047
USC football players, who will do anything
to make it in this town!

01:29.130 --> 01:31.758
<i>By midnight,</i>
<i>most of the ladies have gone home,</i>

01:31.841 --> 01:33.885

01:33.968 --> 01:34.928
Oh.

01:35.011 --> 01:37.055
[both laughing]

01:37.138 --> 01:40.391
I mean, it's just all real laid back.

01:40.475 --> 01:41.810
You know, cocktails.

01:41.893 --> 01:43.853
Everybody getting to know each other.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.563
Folks head out to the pool.

01:45.688 --> 01:46.981
<i>More cocktails.</i>

01:48.066 --> 01:51.027
<i>It's all a lot of fun.</i>

01:51.111 --> 01:52.821
[yelling] Whoa!

01:52.946 --> 01:54.364
Ya, ya, ya!

01:54.447 --> 01:55.698
[all cheer and laugh]

01:56.116 --> 01:59.119
Then, eventually,
the fellas start pairing off.

01:59.202 --> 02:02.789
<i>They find a quiet place, maybe,</i>
<i>to get a little bit more intimate.</i>

02:03.540 --> 02:05.250
Wait a minute, hold on.
So you're saying...

02:05.750 --> 02:07.961
these fellas are queer
as a French horn, right?

02:08.044 --> 02:10.046
What an astute observation, Jack.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.006
It's just we talked about this, Ernie,
you know?

02:12.090 --> 02:13.174
I don't really go for that.

02:13.633 --> 02:14.509
These fellas...

02:15.468 --> 02:17.428
they're not allowed to be
who they really are.

02:17.512 --> 02:18.388
Think about it.

02:18.680 --> 02:19.764
You like women, right?

02:19.848 --> 02:21.307
-Yeah.
-Well, let's say

02:21.724 --> 02:23.226
you're not allowed to like girls.

02:23.309 --> 02:25.436
You get caught kissing a girl in a bar.

02:25.979 --> 02:28.231
You're lucky if they throw you in jail,

02:28.314 --> 02:31.025
'cause somebody could easily
beat you to death instead.

02:31.317 --> 02:33.528
You're treated like an outlaw,

02:34.028 --> 02:36.698
and there's nothing you can do about it,
except hide.

02:37.282 --> 02:38.283
And then...

02:39.534 --> 02:41.077
here's a party,

02:41.536 --> 02:43.830
where you're allowed to like a girl,
kiss her,

02:43.913 --> 02:45.748
find a quiet corner to make love to her.

02:45.832 --> 02:47.876
You'd be at that party, Jack!
I know you would.

02:47.959 --> 02:50.712
These are the great artists of our time.
They make the world go around.

02:50.795 --> 02:53.131
And they gotta spend
their whole lives in hiding? [blows air]

02:53.214 --> 02:55.049
Come on. That's not fair.

02:55.383 --> 02:56.217
[softly] No.

02:56.593 --> 02:57.427
So...

02:58.011 --> 02:59.554
we provide them...

03:00.180 --> 03:01.139
a service.

03:01.639 --> 03:02.473
Huh?

03:02.557 --> 03:05.894
They kick back,
be themselves for the night,

03:05.977 --> 03:09.147
and then you get paid 100 bucks
and go home.

03:10.607 --> 03:12.525
What's wrong with that, huh?

03:12.609 --> 03:15.612
I'll see ya Sunday! Don't be late!

04:17.799 --> 04:20.301
[Roy] I just can't believe I let him
do that to me.

04:20.385 --> 04:22.387
I know he's a heavy hitter in this town,

04:22.470 --> 04:24.472
but I think I might have made
a big mistake.

04:24.555 --> 04:27.767
Mistake? You just signed
with Henry Willson,

04:27.850 --> 04:29.811
the biggest agent in Hollywood.

04:29.894 --> 04:32.272
Like it or not,
that's how it works in this town.

04:32.355 --> 04:33.481
And fellas like us...

04:33.564 --> 04:36.150
well, we gotta make our own rules
by breakin' some of 'em.

04:37.026 --> 04:39.737
One second he was telling me
I had to change my name, and...

04:40.321 --> 04:42.740
the next thing I knew,
he was getting down on his knees!

04:43.199 --> 04:44.033
Wait...

04:46.577 --> 04:48.246
-You got a new name?
-Yeah.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.540
Rock Hudson.

04:51.499 --> 04:52.959
Rock Hudson.

04:55.003 --> 04:56.170
That's spectacular.

04:56.254 --> 04:58.423
I love it.
Can already see it on a marquee.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.550
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.260
[Archie] Eat up, Rock Hudson.

05:03.344 --> 05:04.178
Wow.

05:05.179 --> 05:06.014
Thank you.

05:06.097 --> 05:08.891
Now, my momma,
she makes a better biscuit.

05:08.975 --> 05:11.436
But I reckon my gravy's
every bit as good as hers.

05:13.688 --> 05:15.481
-Mmm.
-[Archie chuckling]

05:15.565 --> 05:17.066
-What you think?
-Mmm!

05:17.525 --> 05:18.985
It's delicious, Archie.

05:19.068 --> 05:20.194
[Archie laughs]

05:20.611 --> 05:22.989
I haven't had somebody fix me a meal
since I was...

05:23.489 --> 05:24.824
I don't know, five years old!

05:25.283 --> 05:26.409
What are you talking about?

05:26.868 --> 05:28.286
Your momma never cooked for you?

05:29.746 --> 05:31.164
No, uh...

05:32.790 --> 05:33.833
She was a little...

05:36.085 --> 05:37.003
crazy.

05:37.754 --> 05:38.713
You know, that...

05:39.380 --> 05:41.090
that's what drove my dad away.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.344
And my stepdad,
he didn't have any use for me.

05:44.427 --> 05:47.555
He-- he told me I could find the ice box
just as well as he could.

05:47.638 --> 05:49.557
So I'd fix my own meals, you know,

05:49.640 --> 05:51.642
which I actually liked at first.

05:51.726 --> 05:52.685
You know, it was...

05:53.019 --> 05:54.937
it was nice
doing something by myself.

05:57.482 --> 05:58.816
I guess, I-- I...

05:59.901 --> 06:01.611
I miss somebody taking care of me.

06:02.945 --> 06:04.864
You're so goddamn sexy.

06:04.947 --> 06:06.157
[chuckling] What do you mean?

06:07.116 --> 06:08.868
I think you could be right for <i>Peg.</i>

06:08.951 --> 06:10.203
The boyfriend part.

06:11.662 --> 06:13.331
I mean, looking at you right now,

06:14.707 --> 06:16.542
-you'd be perfect for it.
-Yeah?

06:16.918 --> 06:18.544
-Mm-hmm.
-Tell me about it.

06:18.628 --> 06:20.380
It's the part of the boyfriend, you see?

06:20.463 --> 06:22.799
The one who says "Don't give up, Peg!
Put down the bottle!

06:22.882 --> 06:24.258
Get out there and audition!"

06:24.342 --> 06:27.970
What makes you think you can sit down
uninvited and interrupt my lunch?

06:28.054 --> 06:31.140
Because I'm the guy
for the role, Mr. Samuels, I know it!

06:31.224 --> 06:32.892
I'm handsome, I'm all-American...

06:32.975 --> 06:34.060
All-American?

06:35.186 --> 06:37.021
Well, that's me you're describing!

06:37.105 --> 06:38.147
Let me be blunt.

06:38.731 --> 06:41.692
I've already seen your screen test,
and it's really, uh...

06:42.026 --> 06:45.029
Well, it's about as bad
as a screen test could possibly be.

06:45.613 --> 06:46.739
Well, you're bad.

06:46.823 --> 06:50.827
For some reason, Miss Kincaid seems
to think that you could become a star,

06:50.910 --> 06:53.579
and, myself, um... I don't see that.

06:53.663 --> 06:56.749
But sometimes she sees things
that I don't, so,

06:56.833 --> 06:58.501
I'm willing to give you an audition.

06:59.085 --> 07:00.753
You are? That's wonderful.

07:02.338 --> 07:04.090
Do you have any words of advice?

07:04.173 --> 07:07.093
Yes. The next time you see someone
sitting alone, having their lunch,

07:07.176 --> 07:10.346
don't just assume that you can sit down
and start talking to them.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.597
[chuckling]

07:12.140 --> 07:14.016
I'm sorry. I meant about the part.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.436
I don't know. Learn the lines.
That's always a good start.

07:16.519 --> 07:20.648
That way, when you audition,
you'll be able to listen and respond,

07:21.315 --> 07:23.276
without even having to think
for the next line.

07:23.359 --> 07:25.069
Yeah, yeah, that makes
a whole lot of sense.

07:25.153 --> 07:28.489
Because this isn't the kind of part
you give to a handsome kid who can't act.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.616
Whoever gets this part
is gonna become a star.

07:30.700 --> 07:31.534
Do you know why?

07:32.326 --> 07:35.496
Because he's the one who says,
"Why, Peg, why?"

07:35.580 --> 07:37.915
He's the one that finds her body

07:37.999 --> 07:41.544
crumpled up underneath
the Hollywood sign under the "H," and...

07:41.627 --> 07:46.174
he... he cradles her in his arms,
and he screams to the heavens...

07:46.257 --> 07:48.342
Peg. Peg, why?

07:48.426 --> 07:50.470
No, don't-- don't--
Don't do it for me now.

07:50.553 --> 07:51.846
[shouting] Peg, why?

07:54.932 --> 07:55.808
So?

07:56.976 --> 07:58.144
Well, so?

07:59.479 --> 08:00.521
So what?

08:01.147 --> 08:02.398
Well, did I get the part?

08:04.525 --> 08:05.776
I'm the writer, Rock.

08:07.904 --> 08:09.655
[softly] I hate to break it to you,

08:09.739 --> 08:13.618
but you're fucking
the least powerful person in Hollywood.

08:32.303 --> 08:33.137
Oh, hi, Henry.

08:34.388 --> 08:35.556
[Henry] Where were you?

08:36.015 --> 08:36.849
Uh--

08:36.933 --> 08:38.643
I know you certainly weren't at a library.

08:38.726 --> 08:41.020
Uh, yeah, I was, uh, out with--
with a friend.

08:41.896 --> 08:42.855
A friend?

08:43.814 --> 08:44.941
Let me tell you a story.

08:46.651 --> 08:49.737
A few years back,
there was a hot new babe on the scene,

08:49.820 --> 08:51.447
by the name of Lana Turner.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.741
Guess who gave her that name? Me.

08:54.116 --> 08:56.953
Her real name was Julia Jean Turner.

08:57.036 --> 08:59.288
That's a real Idaho pig-fucking name.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.998
Anyway, guess what she did?

09:01.499 --> 09:04.043
Our first meeting,
she kept me waiting for 20 minutes.

09:04.585 --> 09:07.797
When she sat down, I told her,
"You ever keep me waiting again,

09:07.880 --> 09:11.384
not only will our relationship be over,
your career will be over.

09:12.009 --> 09:13.469
I will destroy you.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.263
I will fucking annihilate you."

09:15.805 --> 09:16.764
And guess what?

09:17.265 --> 09:18.516
She was never late again.

09:19.559 --> 09:20.977
Always five minutes early.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.439
Sorry, it won't ever happen again.

09:25.523 --> 09:27.024
You bet your ass it won't.

09:27.567 --> 09:32.071
You treat me with the respect I deserve
because I am not just a star,

09:32.154 --> 09:33.489
I am a star maker.

09:33.614 --> 09:37.326
I will not sit here and be treated like
garbage just 'cause I ain't a studio head.

09:38.452 --> 09:40.121
'Cause I'm the real power in this town.

09:40.913 --> 09:43.040
And it's Lah-na Turner by the way.

09:43.124 --> 09:45.876
Lah-na, not Lan-na. Lah-na Turn--

09:45.960 --> 09:48.504
If I ever hear you say "Lan-na" Turner,

09:48.588 --> 09:50.923
you thick country piece of shit,
you're fucking fired.

09:52.925 --> 09:54.260
Understood, Mr. Willson. Yeah.

09:54.594 --> 09:55.428
Lah-na.

09:56.304 --> 09:58.681
-Lah-na. That's--
-Now... [sighs]

09:59.765 --> 10:02.018
I gotta have a frank conversation
with you.

10:03.811 --> 10:05.271
[Henry sighs]

10:05.646 --> 10:06.772
Are you jerking off?

10:07.732 --> 10:09.025
Don't look at me that way.

10:09.108 --> 10:10.151
Everyone has urges

10:10.234 --> 10:12.403
and I need you to masturbate
at least once a day.

10:12.486 --> 10:14.447
I'll give you a day's notice
if I don't want you to

10:14.530 --> 10:16.324
'cause I might ask you
to do it in front of me,

10:16.407 --> 10:20.369
but I can't have you hard as a rock
headin' over to some molly house, okay?

10:20.453 --> 10:23.247
Never! If you get arrested
at one of those places, you're fired.

10:23.331 --> 10:26.584
Any time you think about going out,
you go home, tickle your pickle,

10:26.667 --> 10:28.544
read a fucking book for once,
and go to bed.

10:29.754 --> 10:31.339
There's vice squads in this town.

10:31.422 --> 10:33.507
Cops go hunting for fellas like you.

10:33.591 --> 10:34.425
Now...

10:35.426 --> 10:36.927
I've got something for you.

10:38.012 --> 10:39.347
Oh...Is-- is that <i>Peg?</i>

10:41.932 --> 10:42.808
How did you know?

10:42.892 --> 10:45.853
Well, I-- I heard about it.
Uh, from-- from friends.

10:45.936 --> 10:48.064
From friends? Who are these friends?

10:48.439 --> 10:49.690
Are they actors?

10:50.191 --> 10:51.651
Actors are pieces of meat.

10:51.734 --> 10:55.196
Anything you hear from another actor,
you disregard it.

10:55.279 --> 10:57.073
Listening to what an actor has to say

10:57.156 --> 10:59.158
is like taking career advice
from a farm animal.

10:59.241 --> 11:02.870
The only things you hear
are from Uncle Henry, you got that?

11:04.955 --> 11:05.831
Good.

11:06.165 --> 11:08.209
Now there is a part
in this script for you.

11:09.251 --> 11:10.670
And if you'd played your cards right,

11:10.753 --> 11:12.588
I might have been able to get you
a screen test.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.298
But you're late to this meeting.

11:14.382 --> 11:16.258
Probably 'cause you were out
fucking some actor,

11:16.342 --> 11:19.095
which you could get arrested for,
which puts my reputation on the line--

11:19.178 --> 11:21.305
Know what? Fuck it, you're fired.
Get the fuck out.

11:21.389 --> 11:22.807
No. No, please, Henry.

11:22.890 --> 11:24.266
I-- I-- I'll-- What can I do?

11:25.851 --> 11:26.852
I'll do anything.

11:28.646 --> 11:30.231
[sighs heavily]

11:34.527 --> 11:36.696
If you really want a screen test,

11:37.780 --> 11:40.324
you'll put Tuesday night
on your calendar.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.034
My place.

11:45.287 --> 11:48.916
Uh, but Tuesday is tonight, Henry.

11:49.792 --> 11:50.668
I know.

11:51.836 --> 11:54.046
["Salome's Dance
of the Seven Veils" playing]

12:13.607 --> 12:14.734
Isadora...

12:15.651 --> 12:16.569
She danced...

12:16.944 --> 12:17.945
from her groin!

12:18.904 --> 12:21.449
The emotion, it exploded out of her!

12:22.408 --> 12:23.367
Salome!

12:24.827 --> 12:27.955
Henry, I gotta say, I'm...
I'm pretty bushed.

12:28.998 --> 12:30.541
Shut the fuck up, I'm dancing.

12:46.348 --> 12:48.350
[panting]

12:48.934 --> 12:50.019
Mr. Willson...

12:55.816 --> 12:57.109
You want to go to bed, huh?

12:57.943 --> 12:58.778
[Henry] Okay.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.154
Come on.

13:06.827 --> 13:09.872
Well, Henry, that's a tiny bed.
I'm-- I'm pretty tall.

13:10.539 --> 13:12.041
[groans] That's okay.

13:14.210 --> 13:15.795
I like to make spoons.

13:22.134 --> 13:24.136
[grunting]

13:27.848 --> 13:29.308
[Henry exhales]

13:42.696 --> 13:43.906
[Roy grunts quietly]

14:05.094 --> 14:06.929
-[bell dings loudly]
-[Henry groans]

14:10.057 --> 14:11.559
Where do you think you're going?

14:11.642 --> 14:12.685
Uh, Vic Tanny's.

14:13.644 --> 14:16.063
I got a membership.
I'm going to do some bodybuilding.

14:17.314 --> 14:18.148
Good.

14:18.941 --> 14:19.942
You're doughy.

14:20.526 --> 14:22.987
Henry, I'm going to get
that screen test, right?

14:23.529 --> 14:24.530
Of course, honey.

14:25.531 --> 14:29.493
But first, you're coming to George Cukor's
on Sunday, for a party,

14:29.910 --> 14:32.830
where I will personally introduce you
to the director

14:32.913 --> 14:35.124
and the head of production
at Ace Pictures.

14:35.583 --> 14:37.793
-Golly, thanks, Henry.
-Don't mention it.

14:38.419 --> 14:39.795
Now, get outta here, fatty.

14:42.673 --> 14:44.300
[exaggerated] And you've got a man!

14:44.383 --> 14:46.635
A man who wants to love you
if only you'd let him!

14:46.719 --> 14:48.304
Don't use your hands.

14:49.013 --> 14:50.598
This will be in a close-up.

14:50.681 --> 14:53.517
Your eyes are going to be
what makes you a star.

14:55.144 --> 14:56.395
Act with your eyes.

14:57.730 --> 14:58.772
Now take it back.

15:01.317 --> 15:02.484
It's all right, Jack.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.571
[sighs]

15:06.614 --> 15:08.115
And you've got a man!

15:08.198 --> 15:10.242
A man who wants to love you,
if only you'd let him.

15:10.326 --> 15:11.744
-Who?
-Who?

15:12.536 --> 15:15.205
Who's the fellow who's holding you
in his arms, right now?

15:15.539 --> 15:19.084
Who's the fella who should've walked out
that door a thousand times, but won't?

15:19.752 --> 15:21.754
It's me, Peg! Me!

15:23.255 --> 15:25.549
I won't walk away,
'cause I can't walk away.

15:26.842 --> 15:29.470
You've been cast in the role
of the girl I love,

15:29.553 --> 15:31.263
and I'm your fella, no matter what.

15:33.557 --> 15:34.516
Yes.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.852
Yes, then you pull her in for a kiss.

15:36.936 --> 15:37.770
Good.

15:38.854 --> 15:40.397
Can you feel the difference?

15:41.649 --> 15:42.483
I...

15:42.900 --> 15:45.194
I don't know. I guess. I think so?

15:45.277 --> 15:47.279
There's a new movement coming, Jack.

15:47.363 --> 15:50.491
A whole new style of acting. Naturalism.

15:51.075 --> 15:52.743
Happening now in New York.

15:52.826 --> 15:55.955
The old leftover acting,
from the silent pictures...

15:56.664 --> 15:59.625
the posturing, the obvious indicating...

16:00.250 --> 16:01.794
will soon be a thing of the past.

16:02.419 --> 16:05.547
Now, you're good for this role,
that's true.

16:06.882 --> 16:09.718
But you're never going to be cast
in a picture this important

16:10.302 --> 16:11.762
just because you're good.

16:12.346 --> 16:14.264
You need to be the best.

16:15.724 --> 16:17.059
That's all we'll do today.

16:18.477 --> 16:19.436
Miss Kincaid.

16:20.396 --> 16:21.397
Thank you.

16:22.272 --> 16:25.234
I can't tell you how lucky I feel
to have a mentor like you.

16:25.317 --> 16:26.402
It's what I do.

16:26.902 --> 16:28.612
[chuckles] Yeah.

16:31.573 --> 16:33.117
But you need more than me.

16:35.744 --> 16:37.538
Henry Willson just telephoned me.

16:38.122 --> 16:39.915
He's good friends with Dick Samuels.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.710
He's going to put his new client
up for this role...

16:43.544 --> 16:44.628
Rock Hudson.

16:44.712 --> 16:47.297
If you don't get somebody like Henry
in your corner,

16:47.381 --> 16:48.757
you're not going to stand a chance.

16:53.345 --> 16:57.725
Miss Kincaid, how would I go about
getting someone like Henry Willson?

16:58.892 --> 17:02.062
Maybe it's time for you
to put on your good suit

17:02.479 --> 17:04.231
and meet some people in town.

17:04.314 --> 17:05.482
What are you doing Sunday?

17:05.816 --> 17:06.692
Sunday?

17:09.737 --> 17:11.238
Uh, nothing. Nothing at all.

17:11.321 --> 17:12.156
[knocking on door]

17:12.239 --> 17:13.073
[Ace] Yes?

17:13.782 --> 17:15.242
Dinner is served, Mr. Amberg.

17:15.325 --> 17:17.369
Okay, I'll--  I'll be right there.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.788
-[door closes]
-[exhales] Oh, God.

17:22.207 --> 17:23.375
Have you seen this?

17:24.418 --> 17:28.297
Howard Hughes
got his <i>Spruce Goose</i> off the ground.

17:29.214 --> 17:31.175
That guy's a fuckin' lunatic.

17:32.009 --> 17:34.887
-Where have you been?
-You know, reading scripts.

17:36.430 --> 17:38.640
I've decided to gather
some of the ladies of Hollywood

17:38.724 --> 17:40.559
to cheer up Eleanor Roosevelt.

17:40.642 --> 17:43.479
She still hasn't gotten over
the whole Lucy Rutherford thing,

17:43.562 --> 17:46.398
and I hear lately
she has a real hangdog look about her.

17:46.482 --> 17:47.566
It's called her face.

17:48.275 --> 17:49.151
Charming.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.653
I want to say something.

17:52.696 --> 17:53.655
[clears throat]

17:53.739 --> 17:57.451
I know neither of you want me
to be an actress.

17:57.826 --> 17:59.578
Mummy doesn't
because she never made it

17:59.661 --> 18:01.663
and she knows I'm more beautiful,
and more talented.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.916
You selfish piece of garbage.

18:04.208 --> 18:05.876
[clears throat] And Daddy doesn't

18:05.959 --> 18:09.379
because he thinks the only thing
actresses are good for is putting out.

18:09.463 --> 18:11.715
No, no, no.  I said they were all whores.

18:11.799 --> 18:14.593
John Wayne fucked Mae West
to get his first part,

18:14.676 --> 18:15.677
and nobody bats an eye.

18:16.261 --> 18:20.349
Right. Well, look, I've already gone
and changed my name

18:20.432 --> 18:23.977
so that nobody knows
I'm the studio head's daughter.

18:24.061 --> 18:26.271
And you went and put me in
those acting classes for which

18:26.355 --> 18:28.065
-I have been very grateful!
-Uh-uh, no.

18:28.148 --> 18:30.484
I put you in the acting classes

18:30.567 --> 18:32.444
not because I thought you had talent,

18:32.528 --> 18:35.781
but because I thought you'd realize
what a hard life it was,

18:35.864 --> 18:37.366
you'd come to your fuckin' senses,

18:37.866 --> 18:40.661
and you'd meet some guy on the lot
and get married!

18:40.744 --> 18:41.954
Somebody like, uh, Dick Samuels!

18:42.037 --> 18:43.539
-Dick Samuels?
-[Ace] Yes.

18:43.622 --> 18:45.791
That's who you should marry, Dick Samuels.

18:45.874 --> 18:47.126
He's a genius.

18:47.459 --> 18:50.337
-He's quite the catch.
-Yes, darling. Talk to Dick.

18:52.089 --> 18:54.883
Well, look, there's--
there's a role I want.

18:55.843 --> 18:56.802
Peg Entwistle.

18:57.803 --> 18:58.929
[Avis] Wow.

18:59.513 --> 19:02.558
That's the first time
you've ever shown any initiative.

19:02.641 --> 19:04.101
It feels good, doesn't it?

19:04.393 --> 19:05.894
I, for one, am all for it.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.813
I hope Daddy does give you that part

19:07.896 --> 19:11.650
so you can see your face up
on that screen, 40 feet high,

19:11.733 --> 19:14.611
as the audience recoils in repulsion.

19:14.695 --> 19:18.740
Daddy, can I just get a screen test?
Please?

19:20.742 --> 19:21.827
You know something?

19:22.494 --> 19:23.537
I think that's a good idea.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.999
I will give you a screen test.
You know why?

19:27.082 --> 19:30.586
Because then you will see
with your own two eyes

19:30.669 --> 19:33.255
that you do not have what it takes,
sweetheart.

19:33.338 --> 19:36.049
Ace Amberg!
If you so much as consider it--

19:36.133 --> 19:37.467
Hey! Hey!

19:38.218 --> 19:40.345
I run the studio!

19:40.429 --> 19:42.014
You run this house!

19:42.097 --> 19:44.892
I run the fuckin' town! Okay?

19:44.975 --> 19:46.143
That's it!

19:46.226 --> 19:47.269
[stage bell rings]

19:48.645 --> 19:51.356
Mr. Schlossen,
I just had a question about the scene.

19:51.982 --> 19:52.941
Uh-huh?

19:53.025 --> 19:55.110
I've been Mrs. Cooper's maid
for several years now.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.153
So, when she faints,

19:56.236 --> 19:59.239
I don't think I would run out of the room
and say that original line.

19:59.323 --> 20:02.826
-I'd feel like I want to go get help.
-No, it's funnier as it's scripted.

20:02.910 --> 20:04.912
[crewman] All right, quiet, everybody!

20:05.787 --> 20:07.206
Let's roll camera.

20:07.539 --> 20:09.333
-[crewman] Rolling!
-[stage bell rings]

20:10.918 --> 20:13.921
And... action!

20:15.964 --> 20:16.798
Well...

20:18.091 --> 20:20.844
if one of you gentlemen has a pen,
I'm ready to sign.

20:22.346 --> 20:23.555
Telegram for Mrs. Cooper.

20:23.805 --> 20:25.557
Oh, how lovely.

20:28.560 --> 20:29.728
Whatever can it be?

20:31.271 --> 20:32.272
[gasps]

20:32.439 --> 20:34.191
Oh, this telegram says that...

20:34.274 --> 20:35.901
Andrew is alive.

20:36.860 --> 20:38.695
Oh, they've found him alive!

20:39.112 --> 20:41.198
[lawyer] Mrs. Cooper! Mrs. Cooper!

20:41.657 --> 20:43.575
Did she say Mr. Cooper is alive?

20:43.659 --> 20:44.826
[gasping] Oh!

20:44.910 --> 20:48.080
She done fainted!
Let me go get some smellin' salts!

20:48.413 --> 20:49.623
[whimpering]

20:49.706 --> 20:51.083
-Cut!
-[stage bell rings]

20:51.166 --> 20:53.835
Oh, I think she was right.
That line is so much better.

20:53.919 --> 20:55.420
Who cares what you think?

20:55.504 --> 21:00.133
You say the lines as scripted
or you can get your ass off this set!

21:00.217 --> 21:01.677
-[sighs]
-Do you hear me?

21:01.760 --> 21:02.594
Yes, sir.

21:02.678 --> 21:04.638
You do it again, and you're fired.

21:05.555 --> 21:07.599
That's a wrap. I'm going home.

21:07.683 --> 21:09.810
[crew man] Okay, folks. That's our day.

21:11.853 --> 21:13.063
[door opens]

21:13.146 --> 21:14.648
-[Raymond] Hi!
-[door closes]

21:14.731 --> 21:15.941
I'm home.

21:16.024 --> 21:17.359
[Camille] Hard day at work?

21:17.484 --> 21:18.485
[Raymond groans]

21:18.610 --> 21:21.280
Pre-production is killing me.

21:21.363 --> 21:24.783
Parks and Recreation won't let us shoot
at the actual Hollywood sign.

21:24.866 --> 21:26.410
We might actually have to build our own.

21:27.286 --> 21:28.620
I was thinking...

21:29.246 --> 21:30.455
that you...

21:30.789 --> 21:32.499
should let me screen-test.

21:32.582 --> 21:33.875
Oh, for, uh...

21:34.751 --> 21:35.585
which part?

21:35.669 --> 21:36.545
For Peg.

21:37.254 --> 21:39.172
Oh, honey, I--
I don't know how that would work.

21:39.256 --> 21:42.884
She was white, she was blonde,
she was from London.

21:42.968 --> 21:45.679
But I have an idea.

21:50.100 --> 21:53.687
-So she's not Peg anymore. She's Meg.
-Okay, I'm listening.

21:54.187 --> 21:56.023
-Does that feel good?
-Feels so good.

21:56.106 --> 21:57.482
Oh, Christ, that's good.

21:58.817 --> 22:00.319
[breathing heavily]

22:00.736 --> 22:03.405
So she's Meg Ennis from Mississippi.

22:04.239 --> 22:05.449
And the story's the same,

22:06.533 --> 22:08.327
except now it's not a biography,

22:08.702 --> 22:11.788
it's a parable about
how Hollywood treats an outsider.

22:11.872 --> 22:15.459
Oh, that's good. That's really good.
Oh, that's good. Oh!

22:16.710 --> 22:18.211
I'm the best actress at Ace Pictures.

22:18.545 --> 22:20.922
-You <i>are</i> the best, baby.
-You know it, and the studio knows it.

22:21.006 --> 22:22.215
You're the fucking best, baby.

22:22.299 --> 22:25.218
-So you'll think about it?
-I'll think about it. It's a great idea.

22:26.511 --> 22:27.471
No, really.

22:28.722 --> 22:31.683
I genuinely,
genuinely think it's a great idea.

22:32.100 --> 22:32.976
Really.

22:54.539 --> 22:55.374
So...

22:56.041 --> 22:58.126
I heard you're getting a screen test.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.461
I'm getting one too.

23:00.337 --> 23:02.714
Um, it's not a done deal yet,

23:02.798 --> 23:05.759
but I'm going to do whatever it takes
to make it happen.

23:06.635 --> 23:08.303
In the meantime, I think...

23:08.678 --> 23:11.473
I think you
and I should rehearse together.

23:12.057 --> 23:16.061
They look for chemistry in those tests,
and if you and I...

23:16.853 --> 23:17.771
click,

23:18.313 --> 23:20.816
we could ask to screen-test
opposite one another,

23:20.899 --> 23:24.069
and we'll both have a leg up
on our competition.

23:24.820 --> 23:25.695
You free Sunday?

23:26.405 --> 23:29.282
Oh, Claire... I would love to.

23:30.534 --> 23:32.327
I have to go to a party on Sunday.

23:32.411 --> 23:33.537
What? A...

23:34.663 --> 23:35.580
Wait, it's not...

23:36.623 --> 23:38.250
George Cukor's party, is it?

23:38.333 --> 23:39.209
Yeah.

23:39.292 --> 23:40.335
Wow, that was fast.

23:40.919 --> 23:42.003
Rain check, then.

23:42.504 --> 23:43.505
Oh...

23:44.423 --> 23:45.424
Yeah.

23:48.176 --> 23:49.803
-[cigarette sizzles]
-Ah, fuck!

23:51.012 --> 23:56.643
So now whenever anyone asks me,
"Tallulah, is Errol Flynn a homosexual?"

23:57.018 --> 24:00.397
I say, "What can I tell you?
He never asked to suck my cock."

24:00.522 --> 24:02.524
[all laughing]

24:03.400 --> 24:06.278
So you and George met
at the Farmers Market?

24:06.361 --> 24:07.571
I thought you had a girlfriend.

24:08.530 --> 24:11.366
Do things happen at the Farmers Market
that I'm unaware of?

24:11.450 --> 24:12.367
Oh, yes.

24:12.742 --> 24:15.912
You're oblivious because you don't
have to lurk in the shadows.

24:15.996 --> 24:18.707
And I said, "George is still my director!"

24:18.790 --> 24:20.417
And for all the scenes, the real ones,

24:20.500 --> 24:22.502
the ones that really needed
my heart and soul,

24:22.586 --> 24:25.046
I came over here and I rehearsed them
with George by the pool.

24:25.130 --> 24:27.507
Jack, try to spend some time with Henry.

24:29.593 --> 24:31.094
Do <i>you</i> shop at the market?

24:32.304 --> 24:33.138
Never been.

24:33.221 --> 24:36.558
It is still his movie,
I don't care what anyone says.

24:36.641 --> 24:38.602
Thanks, Viv, that's sweet of you.

24:39.144 --> 24:41.730
Don't eat a bunch,
I'm gonna introduce you to Vivien.

24:41.813 --> 24:44.191
I'm sorry, I never got your name.

24:44.774 --> 24:47.944
Oh, I'm, uh-- I'm Jack Castello, I, uh...

24:48.236 --> 24:49.321
Miss Kincaid invited me.

24:49.821 --> 24:51.156
Nice to meet you, Jack.

24:51.740 --> 24:52.616
Noel Coward.

24:53.283 --> 24:54.326
Pleasure to meet you.

24:55.619 --> 24:57.204
Would you just look at Richard?

24:57.829 --> 24:59.498
He's the most perfect gentleman.

24:59.998 --> 25:01.791
Style, whole demeanor.

25:01.958 --> 25:04.002
Ellen, why don't you just fuck him?

25:04.753 --> 25:07.672
You're about a minute away
from everyone calling you an old maid.

25:07.756 --> 25:08.590
"Old maid"?

25:08.673 --> 25:10.884
You know perfectly well I've been married.

25:10.967 --> 25:13.970
It's not my fault
he was run over by a streetcar.

25:14.054 --> 25:18.266
Vivien, I'd like to introduce you
to a client, this is Rock Hudson.

25:18.683 --> 25:19.684
-Pleasure.
-Hi.

25:21.228 --> 25:23.021
So I take it you're in <i>Gone with the Wind?</i>

25:24.022 --> 25:25.649
-Yes, yes...
-Are you fucking kidding?

25:25.732 --> 25:29.277
She's goddamn Scarlett O'Hara,
you fucking hayseed.

25:29.361 --> 25:31.071
Oh, Henry, it's all right.

25:31.154 --> 25:32.697
I didn't know she was English.

25:32.781 --> 25:37.202
My advice, when dessert arrives,
make an excuse and go home.

25:37.744 --> 25:39.579
I'm always out of here by 10:00.

25:39.663 --> 25:41.623
Perhaps I should refresh his memory.

25:41.706 --> 25:44.584
-Oh, Jesus. Here we go again.
-"Fiddle-dee-dee!

25:44.668 --> 25:45.961
War, war, war.

25:46.586 --> 25:49.297
This war talk's spoiling all the fun
at every party this spring,

25:49.381 --> 25:53.843
I get so bored I could scream!
Besides, there isn't going to be any war."

25:53.927 --> 25:58.056
-"Not going to be a war..."
-You do not want to die in a single bed.

25:58.139 --> 26:01.851
People will talk and you know it.
Old maid.

26:01.935 --> 26:04.187
God, Avis, you can be a vile drunk.

26:05.188 --> 26:07.607
"As God is my witness,
they're not going to lick me."

26:08.066 --> 26:09.317
Old maid.

26:09.401 --> 26:10.819
[door bell rings]

26:11.194 --> 26:12.571
[Ernie] Pretty swanky, huh?

26:13.113 --> 26:14.739
-You look great, kid.
-[Archie chuckles]

26:15.282 --> 26:16.783
It's gonna be a hell of a night.

26:17.951 --> 26:19.286
Mrs. Amberg.

26:20.745 --> 26:21.913
Avis, sweetheart.

26:21.997 --> 26:24.499
Ernie, baby. [giggling]

26:24.791 --> 26:25.834
[both moan]

26:26.001 --> 26:27.335
You're not leaving, are you?

26:27.419 --> 26:29.296
[Ellen] Yes, I'm going to drive her home.

26:29.379 --> 26:31.840
We had a little bit too much
to drink tonight, didn't we, Avis?

26:31.923 --> 26:34.301
-[Avis giggling]
-All sheets to the wind, I'm afraid.

26:34.384 --> 26:36.386
Good night, Ernie. See you soon?

26:37.053 --> 26:38.013
I'll see you real soon.

26:38.096 --> 26:40.765
Wish I could stay to see those USC boys.

26:41.141 --> 26:43.435
-[Ernie chuckling]
-Oh! Ah! [giggles]

26:43.643 --> 26:44.477
[Ellen] Come on.

26:44.936 --> 26:46.688
There's my boy!

26:51.192 --> 26:53.778
-Is Tallulah around?
-Yes, out by the pool, but listen...

26:54.404 --> 26:57.324
I just put Vivien down in the guest house.
She's having one of her episodes.

26:57.407 --> 27:00.160
-Mm.
-She's always had a soft spot for you.

27:00.243 --> 27:01.328
I'll go say hello.

27:03.204 --> 27:04.289
Hi, I'm George.

27:04.831 --> 27:05.749
Welcome.

27:09.002 --> 27:10.879
[indistinct chatter]

27:18.345 --> 27:19.179
Jack.

27:20.138 --> 27:21.973
What the fuck are you doing?
You just walk in?

27:22.057 --> 27:24.643
I told you, we all meet outside,
then we come in together.

27:24.726 --> 27:28.647
No, Ernie, see, uh, I actually got invited
to this, so I'm not working tonight.

27:28.730 --> 27:31.024
Fuck you. You're on the clock, you got it?

27:31.107 --> 27:34.069
Go keep Tallulah Bankhead happy.
All right?

27:38.031 --> 27:39.866
[man] It's not warm, it's freezing!

27:40.241 --> 27:41.618
[all cheering]

27:46.164 --> 27:47.165
Sidecar, please.

27:49.751 --> 27:50.585
Hi.

27:51.503 --> 27:53.713
[stutters] You're directing <i>Peg,</i> right?

27:54.714 --> 27:57.342
I'm-- I'm Rock Hudson,
I'm trying to get an audition.

27:57.425 --> 27:59.135
Oh. Raymond Ainsley.

28:00.095 --> 28:01.388
I got to say, you, uh...

28:01.846 --> 28:03.056
you got the right look.

28:03.473 --> 28:04.307
Yeah?

28:04.641 --> 28:07.936
Well, I signed with Henry Willson
last week, and he gave me the script.

28:12.941 --> 28:14.234
Another one of these, please.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.278
Sure you don't wanna have some water,
Mr. Samuels?

28:17.362 --> 28:20.782
Don't you fucking tell me what to drink.
Why are you still here?

28:22.325 --> 28:25.203
I'm, uh, talking to Rock over here.

28:25.286 --> 28:27.330
Well, go home, I already told you.

28:27.414 --> 28:28.665
I'm sorry, I-- I...

28:28.998 --> 28:29.999
Have I offended you?

28:30.083 --> 28:31.835
I'm, uh... [chuckles] 

28:33.378 --> 28:35.338
I'm sorry. I'm-- I'm going to go.

28:35.422 --> 28:36.965
Well, that's a capital idea.

28:38.299 --> 28:41.553
I'll just leave after I finish this drink
if that's all right with you.

28:46.766 --> 28:48.309
-Archie.
-Hey.

28:48.393 --> 28:51.604
What are you doing here?
I didn't know you knew George Cukor.

28:51.688 --> 28:52.647
[chuckles]

28:53.732 --> 28:54.941
Well, I don't.

28:56.693 --> 28:59.529
I'm here working with the boys
from the gas station,

29:00.113 --> 29:01.573
if you get what I'm saying.

29:03.533 --> 29:06.494
You gotta do what you gotta do
to follow your dreams.

29:07.120 --> 29:08.163
I admire that.

29:09.539 --> 29:10.749
I'll see you tomorrow.

29:26.681 --> 29:30.268
Rule number one at industry functions:
you drink water. Got it?

29:32.729 --> 29:35.231
Dick is getting nice and liquored up,
so...

29:35.982 --> 29:37.859
go comb your fucking hair.

29:37.942 --> 29:40.779
You look like a nelly farmhand
who just fucked a sheep.

29:53.583 --> 29:54.918
[door opens]

30:30.745 --> 30:31.621
Martini, please.

30:35.250 --> 30:37.961
Don't get the wrong idea,
I'm not a heavy drinker.

30:38.419 --> 30:41.464
Sometimes I can go for hours
without touching a drop.

30:41.798 --> 30:43.383
[laughing]

30:44.676 --> 30:45.635
I'm Noel.

30:48.304 --> 30:49.138
Archie.

30:49.848 --> 30:52.851
-Pleasure to meet you.
-I take it you work at the gas station?

30:54.435 --> 30:55.687
I'm also a screenwriter.

30:57.188 --> 30:58.356
'Course you are.

30:58.690 --> 31:01.025
-[man] Whoo!
-[all exclaim]

31:01.109 --> 31:02.360
[both chuckling]

31:02.485 --> 31:03.695
Now who are those guys?

31:04.362 --> 31:07.824
Quarterbacks from the USC football team.

31:08.783 --> 31:11.452
And I suddenly have an interest in sport.

31:18.626 --> 31:19.460
Archie.

31:21.045 --> 31:21.921
Excuse me.

31:26.551 --> 31:27.886
What are you doing here?

31:28.344 --> 31:29.220
I'm working.

31:29.304 --> 31:32.515
-What are you doing here?
-I didn't have a choice. Henry invited me.

31:32.599 --> 31:35.685
-I don't-- I don't like you being here.
-I can't just leave.

31:36.311 --> 31:38.938
It's my other job,
and I need to keep the lights on, so--

31:39.022 --> 31:41.858
-I don't like other guys touching you.
-You don't control me, Rock.

31:41.941 --> 31:43.484
[Henry] Is there a problem here, Rock?

31:44.736 --> 31:46.279
No, there's no problem.

31:46.779 --> 31:48.031
[Noel clears throat]

31:48.448 --> 31:49.824
I hate to be forward,

31:49.908 --> 31:52.952
but would you like to join me
for a little slow dance inside?

31:53.328 --> 31:54.370
I'd love to.

32:00.543 --> 32:01.586
[knocking on door]

32:02.086 --> 32:03.880
-Oh, Ernie!
-Hiya, babe?

32:04.964 --> 32:06.591
[both chuckling]

32:07.425 --> 32:09.177
Where's, uh, Larry?

32:09.719 --> 32:11.304
Oh, I don't know. London?

32:11.846 --> 32:13.848
I'm afraid we've started to grow apart.

32:14.057 --> 32:17.268
He doesn't like my moods, and that doesn't
leave much of me to like, now does it?

32:17.352 --> 32:18.811
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

32:18.895 --> 32:21.898
I was hospitalized recently,
but I'm doing much better now.

32:22.273 --> 32:24.692
And I've got a great piece of material.

32:24.776 --> 32:29.739
Tenns wrote a magnificent play
called <i>A Streetcar Named Desire.</i>

32:29.822 --> 32:31.532
It's about to go up in London.

32:31.616 --> 32:33.993
The role is Blanche DuBois.

32:34.077 --> 32:37.372
In a lot of ways, she's another highly
strung Southern belle like Scarlett.

32:37.914 --> 32:40.208
Oh, that role threw me off the deep end
for two whole years.

32:40.291 --> 32:43.169
Can I, uh, ask what you're doing?

32:43.252 --> 32:45.838
I am organizing my bracelets.

32:46.214 --> 32:47.966
I really do have a lot of them.

32:48.091 --> 32:50.426
A casting director once told me
that my hands were mannish

32:50.510 --> 32:52.345
and gave me an absolute complex about it.

32:52.428 --> 32:54.806
So, now, I never go out
without a bangle or two

32:54.889 --> 32:55.974
to help cut the line, see?

32:56.057 --> 32:57.016
-Vivien...
-See?

32:57.809 --> 32:59.811
I think you're having a case
of the trembles again.

33:01.646 --> 33:02.981
When I get like this, I just...

33:03.940 --> 33:04.899
I can't stop.

33:09.779 --> 33:10.613
You and I...

33:12.115 --> 33:14.659
-have been through this before.
-Yes, yes.

33:16.369 --> 33:18.413
We just need to feed
the kitty a couple times.

33:18.496 --> 33:19.455
Oh, yes.

33:19.539 --> 33:21.207
[big band music plays]

33:29.716 --> 33:31.718
[all cheering]

33:46.232 --> 33:48.776
[Henry]All my life
I wanted to look like that.

33:49.652 --> 33:50.903
Work on my muscles.

33:50.987 --> 33:52.363
[chuckling]

33:52.613 --> 33:54.282
Charles Atlas kind of stuff.

33:55.616 --> 33:57.910
-Well, why didn't you?
-[Henry] Oh, I don't know.

33:57.994 --> 34:01.539
At some point I just knew
that I'd never be a beauty like that.

34:04.125 --> 34:06.878
I'd be the guy who helped
the beautiful people.

34:07.253 --> 34:08.296
Look at them.

34:08.379 --> 34:11.632
They look like chiseled Greek gods,
don't they, Dick?

34:15.344 --> 34:16.637
Henry, you're a vulgarian.

34:21.309 --> 34:22.143
Good night.

34:22.894 --> 34:26.147
Shouldn't you have left hours ago?
Something kept you here.

34:26.522 --> 34:27.356
What is that?

34:28.441 --> 34:29.776
What are you implying?

34:29.859 --> 34:32.612
You've always been such a mystery to me.

34:33.237 --> 34:35.615
Not a whiff of scandal about you.

34:35.698 --> 34:37.533
And yet, here you are,

34:37.617 --> 34:40.495
gazing in wonder at the statues,

34:41.329 --> 34:42.497
like in a museum.

34:46.626 --> 34:47.460
Fuck you.

34:49.045 --> 34:49.921
Excuse me.

34:52.215 --> 34:53.091
Oh, Rock.

34:53.591 --> 34:57.553
Rock Hudson, you remember Dick Samuels,
head of production at Ace Pictures?

34:57.804 --> 34:58.638
Hi, yeah.

34:59.305 --> 35:00.473
Always a pleasure.

35:00.556 --> 35:03.768
Rock was wondering if you and he
could go someplace private

35:03.851 --> 35:06.270
and talk about careers and such.

35:06.854 --> 35:10.108
Rock, why don't you take Dick
to that cottage back there? It's quiet.

35:12.026 --> 35:13.778
Why would I do that, Henry?

35:13.861 --> 35:15.279
Rock's just a young actor.

35:15.947 --> 35:17.073
New on the scene.

35:17.323 --> 35:19.784
You sure could use some career advice,
couldn't you, Rock?

35:20.952 --> 35:22.870
Yeah, is-- is that all right with you...

35:23.329 --> 35:24.330
Mr. Samuels?

35:29.544 --> 35:30.378
Sure.

35:30.628 --> 35:31.671
Why the hell not?

35:42.723 --> 35:44.433
[woman giggling]

35:55.236 --> 35:56.362
What are you doing?

35:56.445 --> 35:57.405
Nothing.

35:58.990 --> 36:01.450
Just admiring the furniture.

36:09.750 --> 36:11.002
It's all Billy Haines.

36:12.670 --> 36:14.213
-The decorator.
-Oh.

36:14.338 --> 36:15.923
Used to be a silent film star.

36:17.508 --> 36:18.843
He was on contract.

36:20.136 --> 36:22.638
But then Louis Mayer found out
which way he swung the bat

36:22.722 --> 36:25.850
and he told him, "Dump the fag boyfriend
or you're fired."

36:28.227 --> 36:29.312
You know what Billy said?

36:30.229 --> 36:32.356
He said, "Go fuck yourself. I quit."

36:33.232 --> 36:35.193
Then he started a decorating business.

36:36.027 --> 36:39.030
His first clients
were Joan Crawford and me.

36:39.989 --> 36:43.242
You don't hear a story like that
very often in this town, do you?

36:44.368 --> 36:47.455
Someone queer who stood up for himself...

36:48.623 --> 36:49.498
and won.

36:52.501 --> 36:55.254
Mr. Willson, I'm, uh... I'm Jack Castello.

36:55.338 --> 36:57.423
Miss Kincaid said I could use your help.

36:57.506 --> 37:00.343
I'm a new contract player at Ace Pictures,
but I don't have an agent

37:00.426 --> 37:01.385
or anything like that.

37:02.637 --> 37:03.846
[Henry sighs]

37:04.180 --> 37:05.640
So, we're talking business, huh?

37:06.349 --> 37:07.475
[Jack chuckles]

37:07.600 --> 37:09.352
Well, we can't talk business here.

37:10.770 --> 37:11.604
Let's take a walk.

37:12.521 --> 37:14.023
Oh, sure. Yeah.

37:46.055 --> 37:47.265
[Henry] Mmm!

37:49.183 --> 37:50.726
To Jack Castello.

37:53.020 --> 37:54.647
I actually like that name.

37:56.482 --> 37:58.150
That means "castle," doesn't it?

37:58.234 --> 37:59.193
[Jack] Mmm.

38:00.111 --> 38:02.780
Jack Castle. What, now, that's a name.

38:03.447 --> 38:05.700
All right. Let me get a good look at you.

38:09.578 --> 38:11.414
Mm-hmm. Okay.

38:13.624 --> 38:15.960
-Take the pants off.
-I beg your pardon?

38:16.043 --> 38:17.253
Are you hard of hearing?

38:17.336 --> 38:18.504
Take your pants off.

38:18.587 --> 38:20.423
I want to see what I'm working with.

38:41.736 --> 38:42.570
Not bad.

38:45.239 --> 38:46.407
You mind if I suck it?

38:51.746 --> 38:54.040
No, I'm sorry. I'm not...
I'm not doing this.

38:54.123 --> 38:55.583
Yeah you are, Jack.

38:57.543 --> 38:58.836
You should be flattered.

38:59.128 --> 39:01.088
I'm married. I got a wife at home.

39:01.172 --> 39:02.465
You think I give a fuck?

39:02.548 --> 39:04.717
I can't keep doing this to her, all right?

39:05.843 --> 39:07.553
You were my way out of this.

39:07.636 --> 39:10.639
I've been doing this.
I've been running around behind her back.

39:10.723 --> 39:13.601
-I've been lying to her.
-Why do you think you're doing that?

39:13.684 --> 39:14.894
'Cause I don't love her.

39:19.857 --> 39:20.733
I don't love her.

39:24.070 --> 39:25.071
I...

39:25.988 --> 39:29.408
Look, we met during the war, you know?
I was being shipped out. I was...

39:29.617 --> 39:31.744
I was terrified.
It felt like the world was ending,

39:31.827 --> 39:33.329
I wanted something to hold on to.

39:34.038 --> 39:36.248
I wanted somebody
I could pray to see again.

39:37.583 --> 39:39.418
It's different now.
Everything's different.

39:39.502 --> 39:40.711
I don't want the same things.

39:40.795 --> 39:42.004
What is it you do want?

39:42.088 --> 39:43.589
I wanna be somebody.

39:44.173 --> 39:46.217
That's why you need me, Jack.

39:47.343 --> 39:49.011
Fate has brought us together.

39:50.888 --> 39:51.972
Why do you...

39:52.723 --> 39:53.557
No.

39:55.643 --> 39:56.477
No.

39:58.312 --> 39:59.313
I'm not doing this.

40:00.064 --> 40:01.857
You're fucked without me, Jack.

40:01.982 --> 40:04.068
I can make that dream of yours come true.

40:04.151 --> 40:05.694
Don't you think I know that?

40:05.778 --> 40:08.906
But it ain't gonna mean anything
if this is what I do to get it!

40:09.156 --> 40:10.032
[snickers]

40:11.450 --> 40:12.326
[groans]

40:12.868 --> 40:13.702
Fuck you.

40:13.953 --> 40:16.288
-Fuck you, Jack. You're done.
-Pfft!

40:17.415 --> 40:19.208
It's over for you now. You're done.

40:25.965 --> 40:27.174
[Dick] Winnetka, huh?

40:27.800 --> 40:29.176
["Sometimes I'm Happy" playing]

40:29.260 --> 40:30.803
I've been to Winnetka, it's nice.

40:31.595 --> 40:34.515
[sighs] I-- I just can't believe
I said that about Vivien Leigh.

40:35.141 --> 40:38.352
Of course I've seen<i> Gone with the Wind,</i>
I just... I didn't recognize her.

40:38.436 --> 40:40.896
-She didn't look the same.
-Don't be so hard on yourself.

40:43.315 --> 40:46.444

40:48.112 --> 40:51.615

[Dick sighs]

41:25.024 --> 41:26.317
Your heart is racing.

41:26.734 --> 41:28.903
I'm-- I'm just a little nervous,
that's all.

41:28.986 --> 41:30.446
[chuckles nervously]

41:59.850 --> 42:01.018
After we do this...

42:03.020 --> 42:05.314
we can talk about me getting
into a picture,

42:05.648 --> 42:06.899
right, Mr. Samuels?

42:15.407 --> 42:16.617
[exhales]

42:20.246 --> 42:21.163
[glass shatters]

42:21.622 --> 42:22.706
Put your clothes on.

42:23.749 --> 42:25.376
-I'm sorry?
-You heard me.

42:25.459 --> 42:27.503
I am not this person, and neither are you.

42:27.586 --> 42:29.463
Put your goddamn clothes on!

42:36.220 --> 42:37.638
I want to know your real name.

42:37.721 --> 42:39.640
The last thing I wanna do is upset you,
Mr.--

42:39.723 --> 42:42.059
Richard! My real name is Richard.

42:42.518 --> 42:46.188
Now tell me your real fucking name,
because it isn't Rock!

42:47.731 --> 42:48.566
Roy.

42:49.024 --> 42:50.150
Roy Fitzgerald.

42:52.319 --> 42:53.737
Henry came up with "Rock."

42:56.448 --> 42:59.326
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

43:00.452 --> 43:02.830
[breath shuddering] What have I done?

43:03.414 --> 43:04.540
[groans]

43:07.543 --> 43:09.670
All of my life, I've been a good man.

43:09.753 --> 43:11.088
I've been a company man.

43:12.131 --> 43:13.132
Which meant...

43:14.341 --> 43:16.802
that I couldn't be who I really was

43:16.885 --> 43:19.430
because then I would get fired, so...

43:20.139 --> 43:22.891
And the loneliness that comes along
with that, I just...

43:24.435 --> 43:27.438
I just accepted it, year after year.

43:27.521 --> 43:29.732
I've been pretending to be someone else.

43:29.815 --> 43:31.734
Just like you're pretending now.

43:31.817 --> 43:33.902
You play the part that
they've written for you...

43:34.778 --> 43:35.988
and then suddenly...

43:37.698 --> 43:38.699
suddenly, it's...

43:41.076 --> 43:42.202
[stammering] It's...

43:42.328 --> 43:43.537
it's just too late!

43:44.038 --> 43:44.872
You're lost.

43:45.331 --> 43:46.457
And...

43:46.540 --> 43:48.584
the person that you were, the... 

43:49.418 --> 43:51.170
the person that you wanted to be...

43:52.046 --> 43:53.172
is just swept...

43:54.298 --> 43:55.466
far out to sea

43:56.050 --> 43:57.968
and you're standing on the shore...

44:02.264 --> 44:03.682
You're watching the pers--

44:03.766 --> 44:05.517
You're watching the person go under,

44:05.601 --> 44:08.062
and there's nothing you can do about it.
It's just...

44:08.520 --> 44:09.563
It's just too late.

44:10.397 --> 44:12.858
And you hate yourself, because...

44:13.734 --> 44:17.488
you're the one responsible
for letting it happen.

44:19.490 --> 44:22.701
Because you wanted people in this town
to love you.

44:23.327 --> 44:25.496
To accept you.

44:31.377 --> 44:32.503
[Roy sniffles]

44:34.088 --> 44:35.964
Don't become me, Roy.

44:36.507 --> 44:37.549
[Roy] Okay.

44:41.095 --> 44:43.681
[sniffles]
Don't let Henry do anything to you.

44:44.098 --> 44:45.766
Whatever he's been doing...

44:46.767 --> 44:48.435
don't let him do it anymore.

44:50.479 --> 44:52.022
I shouldn't have come in here.

44:52.106 --> 44:52.940
I'm sorry.

44:53.399 --> 44:55.609
Nothing happened here tonight,
Mr. Samuels,

44:56.652 --> 44:58.654
except you being a good man. That's all.

44:59.655 --> 45:02.032
You're about the first good man
I've met in Hollywood.

45:03.325 --> 45:04.660
Now, don't you fret, okay?

45:05.411 --> 45:06.537
Let's get you a taxi.

45:07.830 --> 45:08.956

-Oh, yes, yes, yes.
-[Noel chuckling]

45:12.334 --> 45:15.421
[Archie chuckling] Oh, yep. Yes.

45:17.589 --> 45:19.425
Get your hands off of him, please.

45:20.092 --> 45:21.844
-Rock.
-I beg your pardon.

45:21.927 --> 45:23.595
Hands off. That's my boyfriend.

45:26.640 --> 45:28.767
Well, I didn't know you were taken.

45:30.018 --> 45:32.271
If I had, perhaps I wouldn't have wasted
my evening.

45:34.732 --> 45:36.775
Rock, you can't do that.

45:37.151 --> 45:38.402
I don't belong to you.

45:38.902 --> 45:40.112
Well, I belong to you.

45:42.489 --> 45:43.407
Dance with me.

45:43.782 --> 45:45.701
-Folks are gonna see--
-I don't care.

45:46.702 --> 45:47.995
I don't care about that.

45:49.121 --> 45:50.122
I care about you.

45:52.541 --> 45:53.375
I love you.

45:55.085 --> 45:57.087
No one's ever said that to me before.

45:58.547 --> 46:00.549
Don't say anything, Archie.

46:01.049 --> 46:02.092
Just dance with me.

46:17.107 --> 46:19.651
[door opens and closes]

46:19.777 --> 46:21.278
[Raymond sighs]

46:21.361 --> 46:23.906
-[Camille] How was the party?
-Oh, George Cukor...

46:23.989 --> 46:25.908
I tell you, what an absolute gem.

46:26.408 --> 46:27.910
I talked to him about <i>Peg.</i>

46:27.993 --> 46:30.871
I told him about the look
that I was going for...

46:30.954 --> 46:34.249
Raymond, I've been thinking,
and I owe you an apology.

46:34.833 --> 46:38.545
I shouldn't be manipulating you
to put me into your movie.

46:38.629 --> 46:41.048
-Forget that I even--
-What are you talking about?

46:41.131 --> 46:42.299
Stop it. Please.

46:42.716 --> 46:45.344
Come on. That's-- that's just nonsense.

46:46.011 --> 46:48.680
Camille, last night's conversation
got me thinking.

46:49.932 --> 46:50.974
Made me examine...

46:51.934 --> 46:53.060
what we are.

46:53.727 --> 46:54.603
And...

46:55.354 --> 46:56.730
Honey, I'm not just...

46:57.397 --> 46:59.608
sleeping with an actress.

47:01.443 --> 47:04.238
I'm head over heels in love with her.

47:04.822 --> 47:05.864
[Camille] Mm-hmm.

47:05.948 --> 47:07.908
And I hope to marry her one day.

47:10.077 --> 47:11.411
And I so,

47:12.412 --> 47:14.581
to my very core, believe in her.

47:14.706 --> 47:15.874
That's why I think...

47:16.667 --> 47:17.501
you...

47:18.544 --> 47:19.962
need to be in that spotlight.

47:20.379 --> 47:22.381
Your name needs to be on that marquee.

47:22.464 --> 47:24.550
I want you to be the star of <i>Meg.</i>

47:26.927 --> 47:27.803
Really?

47:27.886 --> 47:29.096
You're a star, Camille.

47:29.179 --> 47:32.182
You're a star,
and of course you're right for this part.

47:33.141 --> 47:35.602
I'm just so embarrassed
it took me this long to see it.

47:35.686 --> 47:36.520
And I'm sorry.

47:37.312 --> 47:38.856
I'm going to get you that screen test,

47:38.939 --> 47:41.149
I don't care how hard I gotta fight
to make it happen.

47:41.859 --> 47:43.318
[both chuckling]

47:52.619 --> 47:54.329
[Henrietta] How was the night shoot?

47:57.875 --> 47:58.792
It was good.

47:59.543 --> 48:00.669
It was good, um...

48:03.463 --> 48:05.340
Went longer than I thought, you know?
But...

48:06.466 --> 48:07.885
we got everything.

48:09.928 --> 48:11.221
I thought you'd be asleep.

48:12.431 --> 48:16.101
I tried, but these two decided
to have a boxing match.

48:35.454 --> 48:36.914
[crying] I'm sorry, Hen.

48:37.497 --> 48:38.457
For what?

48:38.540 --> 48:40.208
You deserve so much better, and...

48:40.292 --> 48:43.003
I'm sorry, and I promise
I'm gonna do better.

48:45.422 --> 48:46.256
Come on.

48:46.632 --> 48:47.716
[Jack sniffles]

48:52.763 --> 48:53.722
I love you.

48:55.057 --> 48:56.516
You know that, right?

48:57.142 --> 48:58.185
[sniffles]

49:05.609 --> 49:06.944
Let's go to bed.

49:22.918 --> 49:25.170
[Dick]
So your mother is from the Philippines.

49:25.253 --> 49:27.047
Why didn't you mention this before?

49:27.130 --> 49:31.468
I didn't want to risk
being put in a category, so I-- I hid.

49:33.929 --> 49:35.639
I was ashamed of who I was.

49:35.722 --> 49:39.434
But I'm tired of playing it safe.
I want to be different.

49:39.518 --> 49:42.396
I want to be who I am
and I want to start taking risks.

49:43.814 --> 49:47.401
Camille Washington is the best actress
for this role, and you know it.

49:47.484 --> 49:49.486
I insist that she be given a screen test.

49:50.612 --> 49:52.280
If that doesn't happen, then...

49:54.199 --> 49:55.617
then I don't direct the picture.

49:55.742 --> 49:56.785
It's as simple as that.

49:59.204 --> 50:00.664
Thank you for your time.

50:06.920 --> 50:08.296
[door opens and closes]

50:08.422 --> 50:09.840
Well, he's right, you know.

50:10.841 --> 50:12.092
Of course he's right.

50:12.843 --> 50:13.969
[Ellen exhales]

50:15.721 --> 50:17.305
Which is why we're going to do it.

50:18.682 --> 50:19.975
[Ellen chuckling] My God.

50:20.058 --> 50:21.852
What the hell will Ace say?

50:21.935 --> 50:24.021
-This could get us fired.
-Oh, please.

50:24.354 --> 50:26.732
I'd love to see him try to run this studio
on his own.

50:26.815 --> 50:28.567
That imbecile can barely read.

50:29.067 --> 50:30.777
I didn't fight for Anna May Wong.

50:31.194 --> 50:33.155
I didn't fight for a lot of people.

50:35.532 --> 50:36.658
I want to fight again.

50:36.742 --> 50:40.245
And Ace can't stop us
if you and I are willing to fight.

50:40.328 --> 50:41.788
Richard, I could kiss you.

50:41.872 --> 50:43.749
This is exactly
what this studio needs right now.

50:43.832 --> 50:46.710
Something no one saw coming,
something new, something fresh.

50:47.878 --> 50:49.421
Let's test her and see how she does.

50:49.504 --> 50:51.798
God, I love it when you talk like a mogul.

50:52.132 --> 50:53.508
It's almost convincing.

50:53.592 --> 50:55.385
Watch it, Kincaid, or I'll fire you.

50:55.469 --> 50:56.720
[kisses, laughing]

50:56.803 --> 50:58.055
You wouldn't dare.

50:58.764 --> 51:02.100
Rock, I wanted to apologize
about last night.

51:02.184 --> 51:05.187
I had too much to drink
and I crossed a line.

51:05.270 --> 51:07.314
I should never have
sent you off with Dick

51:07.397 --> 51:08.648
and I'm sorry.

51:08.732 --> 51:11.359
That's all right, Mr. Willson.
Nothing happened.

51:11.443 --> 51:12.277
Really?

51:13.278 --> 51:14.112
Shit.

51:14.946 --> 51:15.947
Kinda wish it had.

51:16.406 --> 51:17.574
Could've used it against him.

51:17.657 --> 51:18.658
Anyway...

51:19.493 --> 51:20.660
uh...

51:21.453 --> 51:24.998
Oh, as for <i>Peg,</i>
I think I can get you this part.

51:25.332 --> 51:29.669
Your screen test has to go well,
but I'm in Dick's ear about it,

51:29.753 --> 51:33.090
and Ace Amberg's wife, Avis?
She's a close friend of mine.

51:33.465 --> 51:35.884
Mr. Willson, I don't--
I don't know what to say.

51:35.967 --> 51:37.302
Let me say something, then.

51:38.345 --> 51:40.472
You bring out something in me, Rock.

51:41.056 --> 51:43.308
Something I haven't felt in a long time.

51:43.683 --> 51:44.726
You're something...

51:47.145 --> 51:49.439
You're some-<i>one</i> I can believe in.

51:49.523 --> 51:52.317
Someone who needs me
to be the best I can be.

51:52.400 --> 51:54.444
It's been a long time since I felt that.

51:55.237 --> 51:56.863
It was a long time ago now.

51:56.947 --> 51:58.740
Even feels longer than it was.

52:00.158 --> 52:01.284
I met somebody.

52:02.702 --> 52:05.580
Trent was his name. Trent Durkin.

52:05.664 --> 52:07.582
But everybody called him Junior.

52:08.250 --> 52:10.085
He was so good-looking.

52:11.378 --> 52:13.713
I couldn't believe he had eyes for me.

52:14.381 --> 52:16.550
And when he smiled, it just--

52:17.300 --> 52:19.427
[chuckling] ...it just lit up a room.

52:20.053 --> 52:21.930
You couldn't take your eyes off him.

52:24.391 --> 52:26.059
And he cared for me.

52:28.562 --> 52:30.272
I was a nothing then, but...

52:31.815 --> 52:34.484
he thought I was somebody, he really did.

52:36.403 --> 52:39.447
And that is something
I never thought would happen.

52:39.698 --> 52:41.324
I thought my life would come and go

52:41.408 --> 52:43.410
and I would never know
what that felt like.

52:44.661 --> 52:45.829
He and I...

52:46.329 --> 52:48.081
[sighs] ...we were inseparable.

52:51.126 --> 52:52.502
We lived together.

52:54.713 --> 52:56.798
Junior wanted to be a movie star.

52:57.757 --> 53:00.719
And I wanted to be the one
who made that happen.

53:06.433 --> 53:07.475
One night...

53:09.311 --> 53:11.271
he was killed in a car crash.

53:15.025 --> 53:16.443
I cradled his body.

53:18.653 --> 53:19.863
And I kissed him.

53:21.948 --> 53:23.575
And I told him I loved him.

53:25.410 --> 53:27.704
[breath shuddering]
But he was already gone.

53:30.123 --> 53:31.917
Something in me just broke.

53:33.293 --> 53:34.711
You know what I mean?

53:34.836 --> 53:37.505
I couldn't even remember
what it felt like to love him.

53:43.261 --> 53:45.180
And there's something about you, Rock.

53:47.641 --> 53:50.018
It makes me remember what that felt like.

53:51.603 --> 53:52.646
To have Junior.

53:54.981 --> 53:56.358
And I know you're not him.

53:57.734 --> 53:59.527
You're nothing like him, actually, but...

54:00.654 --> 54:01.821
meeting you...

54:03.031 --> 54:05.242
My life has a purpose again.

54:06.034 --> 54:07.702
I have a passion again.

54:08.536 --> 54:10.789
You are my passion, Rock Hudson.

54:10.872 --> 54:13.124
I'd kill for you, kid,
and I ain't foolin'.

54:15.794 --> 54:18.088
I'm gonna make you
the biggest star in the world.

54:22.717 --> 54:24.678
Um, Mr. Willson, I don't know what to...

54:25.595 --> 54:27.305
Well, I'm speechless.

54:27.389 --> 54:29.766
Make yourself useful and grab me a tissue,
you big galoot.

54:29.849 --> 54:31.226
I'm crying like a baby over here.

54:38.441 --> 54:40.193
[pours drink]

54:44.656 --> 54:47.575
Mmm! Oh, that's much better. Thank you.

54:48.326 --> 54:49.202
So...

54:49.869 --> 54:51.788
[sniffles] So, the screen test.

54:52.747 --> 54:54.874
-Friday morning.
-What, this... this Friday?

54:54.958 --> 54:55.792
Yeah.

54:56.793 --> 54:59.796
Oh, thank you, Mr. Willson.
I can't thank you enough.

54:59.921 --> 55:02.257
Well, do you remember what I said
about actors?

55:02.340 --> 55:05.343
How they're garbage, can't be trusted?
You can't be friends with them?

55:05.427 --> 55:06.594
I didn't mean that.

55:07.554 --> 55:11.641
God, you're new in town,
you could use some friends, probably.

55:12.726 --> 55:13.601
Yeah.

55:13.685 --> 55:15.228
Yeah, that'd be nice.

55:15.312 --> 55:17.105
-Oh.
-[Roy chuckles]

55:17.314 --> 55:19.274
Good, I was hoping you'd say that.

55:19.858 --> 55:20.692
Come here.

55:23.111 --> 55:25.530
I got a couple of new clients
I want you to meet.

55:27.615 --> 55:30.618
Rock, this is Rory Calhoun
and Tank Meyers.

55:30.702 --> 55:33.455
Boys, this is the fella
I was telling you about.

55:33.538 --> 55:34.372
Hiya, Rock.

55:34.831 --> 55:35.790
Nice to meet you.

55:36.166 --> 55:37.000
[Roy] Hi.

55:37.083 --> 55:38.418
-How you doing?
-Uh, good.

55:39.210 --> 55:41.755
Uh, H-- Henry, what's going on here?

55:41.838 --> 55:45.050
Nothing's happening.
These are just your new friends.

55:45.133 --> 55:47.677
You're gonna sit over there on the bed

55:47.761 --> 55:52.182
and I'm gonna watch while
the three of you, you get acquainted.

55:53.391 --> 55:55.602
So what were you fellas talking about?

55:56.019 --> 55:58.313
Um... football.

55:58.396 --> 56:02.150
Oh, yeah? Got a couple
of real professors here, right?

56:07.822 --> 56:09.824
[big band music playing]
