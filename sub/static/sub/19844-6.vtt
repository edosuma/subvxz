03:35.330 --> 03:39.133
was that it was a spirit

to get back into this world.

38:38.264 --> 38:39.676
[sighs]

38:45.249 --> 38:46.891
Of course you'd enter

38:46.939 --> 38:49.811
in the creepiest way possible... Again.

38:50.084 --> 38:52.413
Tell me what you found, I'll leave.

38:52.889 --> 38:54.014
Good news:

38:54.124 --> 38:55.731
I finally managed to
get into the dungeon.

38:55.755 --> 38:58.577
Bad news: I saw nada.

38:58.913 --> 39:00.788
Other semi-good news:

39:01.014 --> 39:03.057
the place smelled like sandalwood.

39:03.772 --> 39:05.014
And?

39:05.110 --> 39:08.577
My friend, Davina, she
taught me if you smell that,

39:08.704 --> 39:11.005
chances are something's cloaked.

39:13.374 --> 39:15.209
Which means...

39:15.422 --> 39:17.522
Marcel's down there.

39:25.461 --> 39:27.695
Did you retrieve all of the weapons?

39:27.850 --> 39:29.163
Well, I don't know.

39:29.286 --> 39:31.183
Let's confirm with Dominic, shall we?

39:31.249 --> 39:32.366
Oh, wait, we can't.

39:32.430 --> 39:35.194
His corpse is currently
burning in a Dumpster.

39:35.561 --> 39:38.381
I try to avoid bloodshed, you
become the town executioner.

39:38.420 --> 39:40.483
Let me handle this.

39:40.579 --> 39:42.959
Why exactly should I do that?

39:43.241 --> 39:44.921
Hope.

39:46.278 --> 39:48.277
You see, it's precisely because of her

39:48.417 --> 39:50.383
that I have to assert my involvement.

39:50.573 --> 39:52.449
Let me help brother.

39:52.590 --> 39:54.590
Tell me what you know.

39:57.914 --> 40:00.366
This thing wants to be reborn.

40:01.148 --> 40:02.671
This morning, Vincent said that

40:02.712 --> 40:06.577
whenever it resurfaces,
it does so in four distinct locations.

40:06.656 --> 40:08.359
I can't tell why.

40:08.546 --> 40:10.158
HAYLEY: It's looking for something.

40:10.241 --> 40:11.952
Four things, by the sound of it.

40:12.015 --> 40:14.447
And I'm pretty sure
that I have one of them.

40:14.635 --> 40:16.468
My parents were killed
protecting this

40:16.595 --> 40:18.937
from one of the Hollow's
followers.

40:19.218 --> 40:21.104
KLAUS: We've seen this
time and time again.

40:21.161 --> 40:23.101
When a witch wishes to be reborn,

40:23.191 --> 40:25.090
its remains are required
to complete the spell.

40:25.130 --> 40:26.863
You've just found a piece of our enemy.

40:26.936 --> 40:29.499
Lucky me. Who has the other three?

40:32.233 --> 40:34.027
Dominic.

40:36.186 --> 40:38.726
Dominic said that he
had found something here.

40:38.807 --> 40:41.296
What? There's just, like,
a bag of bones laying around

40:41.359 --> 40:43.163
that I didn't know about?

40:44.632 --> 40:47.420
No. But there is one.

40:52.335 --> 40:55.536
[men chanting in foreign language]

41:07.417 --> 41:09.384
[chanting continues]

41:12.573 --> 41:14.756
[gasps]

41:27.627 --> 41:29.658
Dominic's death was a distraction.

41:29.757 --> 41:31.680
They used our own
deception against us.

41:31.758 --> 41:33.377
This thing has followers
everywhere.

41:33.495 --> 41:35.207
They've infiltrated the entire city.

41:35.265 --> 41:37.094
If they get to the other
bones before we do...

41:37.137 --> 41:40.055
They may well try to
raise this monstrosity.

41:42.700 --> 41:44.652
And it will come for us all.
