00:00.185 --> 00:01.819
<i>Previously</i>
<i>on The Borgias...</i>

00:01.819 --> 00:03.854
You are the joy
of my life.

00:03.989 --> 00:05.656
You know that I know
that that isn't true.

00:05.689 --> 00:07.491
How long can we
last like this?

00:07.559 --> 00:08.893
Rumour has it

00:08.960 --> 00:10.828
that there are three in
this marriage, not two!

00:10.896 --> 00:12.596
Do not provoke me, my lord.

00:12.664 --> 00:14.832
He could cause public
scandal, if he...

00:14.866 --> 00:17.635
<i>intimates any</i>
<i>impropriety between us.</i>

00:17.669 --> 00:19.403
<i>We are family;</i>
<i>we love each other.</i>

00:19.504 --> 00:20.805
Where is the scandal?

00:20.872 --> 00:22.473
I would confound this pope.

00:22.507 --> 00:24.308
More than
you have already?

00:24.310 --> 00:26.811
<i>I have the arms,</i>
<i>the cannon, and the castle.</i>

00:26.845 --> 00:28.045
This is our moment.

00:28.113 --> 00:30.047
Catherina Sforza
plots with Naples.

00:30.115 --> 00:31.549
She reinforces
her stronghold.

00:31.650 --> 00:33.150
She requisitions cannon.

00:33.218 --> 00:34.785
She will soon
be impregnable.

00:34.820 --> 00:36.587
You are charged with
my sister's protection.

00:36.655 --> 00:38.422
I would know where she is,
where her husband is

00:38.490 --> 00:40.458
<i>at every hour of every day.</i>

00:40.492 --> 00:42.560
I was prisoner in Naples.

00:42.661 --> 00:44.895
And now I'm
prisoner in Rome.

00:44.963 --> 00:46.497
<i>Cesare Borgia comes and goes</i>

00:46.531 --> 00:47.865
like a ghost in the night.

00:47.899 --> 00:49.467
You know he has the
French King in his pocket

00:49.501 --> 00:51.102
and the French army
at his beck and call,

00:51.169 --> 00:52.736
and nobody knows what
he's going to do next.

00:52.838 --> 00:54.171
You hate him, don't you?

00:54.206 --> 00:55.873
I love my hide more
than I hate him.

00:59.578 --> 01:01.779
<i>Let this be a lesson</i>
<i>to those who would betray me.</i>

01:01.847 --> 01:03.614
<i>As Catherina Sforza gathers</i>
<i>allies to her daily,</i>

01:03.682 --> 01:05.015
<i>the end game will be war.</i>

01:05.050 --> 01:06.317
Give me command!

01:06.384 --> 01:07.985
We share the same aims,
Father.

01:08.019 --> 01:09.954
But what are your aims?
You do not share them with us!

01:10.021 --> 01:11.722
If we weaken now,
they destroy us.

01:11.756 --> 01:13.858
I will carve you
out an empire.

01:13.892 --> 01:15.493
Trust me.

01:15.527 --> 01:17.194
<i>Rome is no longer</i>
<i>the Borgia Pope alone.</i>

01:17.262 --> 01:19.663
Rome is Cesare Borgia also.

[♪]

02:59.064 --> 03:02.933
I have no servants
when here in Rome, my lord.

03:02.968 --> 03:05.202
Florence can no
longer afford them.

03:05.237 --> 03:07.905
<i>Ah, democracy,</i>
<i>Senor Machiavelli.</i>

03:07.939 --> 03:09.807
They say it has
its merits.

03:13.211 --> 03:15.212
What would you say

03:15.247 --> 03:17.648
is the perfect crime,
my lord?

03:19.751 --> 03:22.786
The one without a victim?
Hm.

03:22.887 --> 03:24.288
The one without a suspect.

03:25.890 --> 03:28.125
And I have often thought

03:28.193 --> 03:32.429
that whoever killed your
brother remained unsuspected-

03:32.530 --> 03:35.399
but made a suspect
of everybody.

03:35.433 --> 03:38.269
Such a one has committed
the perfect crime.

03:40.739 --> 03:43.540
And such a one may,
one day,

03:43.575 --> 03:45.309
make the
perfect prince.

03:53.918 --> 03:57.554
How can one be a prince
without a principality?

03:57.622 --> 03:59.290
One cannot.

03:59.391 --> 04:00.824
Which is why,
I presume,

04:00.892 --> 04:03.794
you came to talk
to me of Forli.

04:05.930 --> 04:09.433
If Rome moves on Forli,
what would Florence do?

04:09.467 --> 04:11.101
You know well what
Florence will do.

04:11.169 --> 04:13.937
What we always do.
Nothing.

04:13.972 --> 04:17.308
We must cross the borders
of Florence to get there.

04:17.375 --> 04:19.476
Do so then at night.

04:20.577 --> 04:22.346
But armies make noise.

04:22.414 --> 04:24.715
I'll make sure
they move quietly.

04:24.783 --> 04:26.583
No disturbance,
no pillage.

04:26.651 --> 04:30.120
Two armies I have heard.
Double the noise.

04:31.423 --> 04:33.757
Can you keep a secret?

04:33.825 --> 04:35.526
The French Army
is already there

04:35.627 --> 04:37.127
in the Romagna forests.

04:38.263 --> 04:39.697
Well beyond
Florentine borders.

04:41.000 --> 04:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:14.532 --> 05:16.100
I will send the papal
army ahead of me

05:16.167 --> 05:17.701
under cover of night.

05:17.769 --> 05:19.970
What, no grand departure?
No cheering crowd?

05:20.004 --> 05:22.439
No, nothing
like that.

05:22.474 --> 05:25.209
And it is better if you know
nothing of my progress.

05:25.276 --> 05:26.956
I will have them at
the borders of Florence

05:27.011 --> 05:28.979
before Florence awakes.

05:29.047 --> 05:30.814
Well, we cannot justify to
the Florentine ambassador-

05:30.849 --> 05:33.183
You will not have to.

05:33.284 --> 05:34.618
I have his assurance

05:34.652 --> 05:37.521
we can skirt their
territories and move on.

05:37.622 --> 05:39.623
Hm, well, as Socrates said,

05:39.657 --> 05:43.026
"True wisdom is knowing
that you know nothing."

05:43.128 --> 05:46.196
I will carve you out
an empire, Father.

05:46.231 --> 05:48.732
But who will rule it
after we are gone, huh?

05:50.969 --> 05:54.138
All this rancour,
this discord.

05:54.172 --> 05:56.240
Votes in conclave
bought and sold.

05:56.307 --> 05:58.675
Families and factions,
blade against blade.

06:02.247 --> 06:07.151
Would it not be simpler

06:07.185 --> 06:12.022
just to hand on the keys of
St. Peter's from father to son?

06:16.528 --> 06:18.328
Primogeniture.

06:19.697 --> 06:21.098
It's the simplest
and most efficient

06:21.199 --> 06:23.100
transfer of power
known to man.

06:25.537 --> 06:28.038
Like...
like a monarchy.

06:28.106 --> 06:30.541
Hm...

06:30.575 --> 06:35.212
God's true kingdom,
here on earth.

06:35.246 --> 06:39.383
Handed from father to son?

06:39.417 --> 06:42.386
Is God served well
by the papal elections?

06:43.621 --> 06:46.123
Is the College of Cardinals
mentioned in the gospels?

06:47.425 --> 06:49.426
No.

06:49.527 --> 06:52.529
That is the past.

06:54.499 --> 06:57.835
Primogeniture
is the future.

06:57.902 --> 06:59.536
Simple, preordained.

07:01.539 --> 07:02.906
The world would
not tolerate...

07:02.941 --> 07:06.610
Not yet.
But...

07:06.678 --> 07:08.245
See, we have the power to
make and unmake monarchies

07:08.279 --> 07:09.680
but we have no
kingdom of our own.

07:12.217 --> 07:17.955
No, if you create
for us a kingdom,

07:18.022 --> 07:20.491
we will write the
book of our future.

07:20.558 --> 07:22.793
The future of the church,
of the world we live in,

07:22.894 --> 07:24.228
will be ours-

07:26.531 --> 07:30.701
yours, and
your children's.

07:35.874 --> 07:38.008
You say nothing?

07:39.110 --> 07:41.345
I am...

07:41.379 --> 07:43.347
...stunned
into silence.

07:43.381 --> 07:47.584
Why do you think we wished
you a cardinal, hm?

07:47.619 --> 07:51.188
So you would
be pope one day.

07:51.222 --> 07:54.224
Carve us out
a kingdom, Cesare.

07:54.292 --> 07:56.727
And be both king and pope.

07:59.264 --> 08:01.532
Hm?

08:11.242 --> 08:13.443
You saw what
happened to Colonna,

08:13.545 --> 08:15.345
so you know the rules.

08:15.413 --> 08:17.214
We knew them
already, my lord.

08:17.248 --> 08:18.882
Good.

08:18.917 --> 08:23.287
Never presume that I will not
act on my worst instincts.

08:23.321 --> 08:25.989
Or that it is not in your best
interests to stay loyal to me.

08:27.559 --> 08:28.926
We have an army here.

08:28.960 --> 08:31.929
It is well stocked,
powdered at last.

08:31.996 --> 08:33.429
It has generals.

08:33.464 --> 08:35.732
They imagine they rule.
They don't.

08:35.767 --> 08:37.134
You rule.

08:37.235 --> 08:38.902
Armies act like locusts

08:38.937 --> 08:40.604
on the lands that
they move through.

08:40.638 --> 08:43.273
You will prevent these
armies from doing so.

08:43.308 --> 08:46.577
You will attack one citadel,
and one citadel only.

08:46.644 --> 08:48.378
The citadel of Forli.

08:48.446 --> 08:50.414
And now my friends,
meet your troops.

08:52.317 --> 08:53.951
What does this
sword read?

08:53.985 --> 08:56.787
Aut Caesar! Aut nihil!

08:59.524 --> 09:01.224
So, we are with him now.

09:01.326 --> 09:03.160
I would not be against him.

09:03.194 --> 09:04.928
<i>What does this sword read?</i>

09:04.963 --> 09:12.302
"Aut Caesar! Aut nihil!"]

09:12.337 --> 09:15.172
Either Cesare
or nothing.

09:47.972 --> 09:49.673
We have shamed him,
Brother.

09:49.707 --> 09:51.642
I have?

09:51.676 --> 09:53.677
In more ways
than I can count.

09:53.745 --> 09:54.911
My lady.

09:56.014 --> 09:56.980
My lord.

09:57.015 --> 09:59.149
He knows.

09:59.183 --> 10:00.550
Somewhere he knows.

10:04.188 --> 10:05.522
Oh.

10:09.827 --> 10:12.062
Mm...

10:12.096 --> 10:14.865
Why is it your touch is
the only one that soothes me?

10:22.340 --> 10:25.042
You have spent a lifetime
pulling away from me.

10:25.176 --> 10:26.677
I am tired of that.

10:29.547 --> 10:32.049
I am tired
of my husband.

10:32.183 --> 10:34.618
I am tired of life.

10:34.686 --> 10:36.887
The only thing that
never tires me is you.

10:40.558 --> 10:43.060
Can you tell me why?
Why...

10:44.796 --> 10:47.731
Why we're cursed
with this feeling

10:47.765 --> 10:50.901
that feels so...

10:50.968 --> 10:53.236
natural...

10:53.371 --> 10:54.404
...and good?

10:57.075 --> 10:58.475
Why, when we're
together,

10:58.576 --> 11:00.077
God seems to sit in
the room with us?

11:04.849 --> 11:06.917
And when you're away

11:06.951 --> 11:08.752
I manage to forget you...

11:12.390 --> 11:15.258
and then one touch
of your hand

11:15.326 --> 11:17.260
and God comes
rushing back.

11:19.897 --> 11:21.898
God or the Devil.

11:21.933 --> 11:24.501
Whatever it is,
it overwhelms.

11:30.241 --> 11:31.641
I have to leave soon.

11:33.144 --> 11:35.145
Yes, I know.

11:40.017 --> 11:41.618
You have your
army at last.

11:42.787 --> 11:44.755
You have castles
to knock down.

11:50.461 --> 11:53.463
Will you think of me
a little?

11:53.498 --> 11:55.632
And will you promise
to protect yourself?

12:00.471 --> 12:02.639
What could
console you, Sis?

12:09.947 --> 12:13.550
The one thing that could,
I think, is another child.

12:16.053 --> 12:18.955
My husband seems only capable
when he's in his cups...

12:20.391 --> 12:22.192
Oh!

12:22.293 --> 12:24.127
As he is now.

12:30.334 --> 12:31.902
Ah, Brother.

12:32.003 --> 12:33.170
Alfonso.

12:33.237 --> 12:34.905
Or is it Il Duce?

12:35.006 --> 12:36.306
That too.

12:36.340 --> 12:38.508
Have you-
have you met my shadows?

12:38.576 --> 12:43.280
They watch me drink,
they watch me fuck!

12:43.347 --> 12:45.215
I had a brother who
smelt like that.

12:45.249 --> 12:46.950
Like what?
Wine. Too much.

12:47.051 --> 12:49.119
Ooh, but he died.

12:49.187 --> 12:50.520
Yes, of the same.
Of what?

12:50.555 --> 12:52.722
Indulgence!
Stop, my love.

12:52.757 --> 12:55.025
Can't you hear?
His army's on the march.

12:55.059 --> 12:56.526
Can I join them?
Alfonso!

12:56.561 --> 12:58.528
Oh, no, I think we can
all agree I'm useless here,

12:58.596 --> 13:01.264
but I can wield a sword.

13:01.332 --> 13:02.566
Put it down,
my love.

13:02.700 --> 13:04.568
I can even draw blood.

13:04.602 --> 13:06.336
Don't.
I'd welcome a challenge.

13:07.371 --> 13:09.039
A conquest
of any kind.

13:10.908 --> 13:13.210
Am I hired then?

13:15.546 --> 13:18.014
When I return, I will
consider a commission.

13:18.049 --> 13:20.217
Until then,
rest your blade.

13:26.824 --> 13:28.725
<i>Steady on, men!</i>

13:30.194 --> 13:31.661
<i>Guards,</i>
<i>to the battlements!</i>

13:38.202 --> 13:39.703
<i>Yes, Captain!</i>

13:43.841 --> 13:45.242
<i>Hold your lines!</i>

13:45.343 --> 13:47.043
<i>Rear guard to the battlements!</i>

13:57.054 --> 13:58.622
<i>Remain in cohorts!</i>

13:58.723 --> 14:00.090
<i>Hold the pennants high!</i>

14:07.465 --> 14:09.399
<i>Keep formation</i>
<i>at the front, there!</i>

14:13.404 --> 14:16.172
Would that you
could fight, Mother.

14:16.240 --> 14:18.475
I can scratch.
Like a cat.

14:20.778 --> 14:24.681
I have lost
my henchman.

14:24.749 --> 14:27.450
I miss his counsel.

14:27.485 --> 14:31.321
I could counsel
if I cannot fight.

14:31.422 --> 14:33.757
He could read me
like a book.

14:35.593 --> 14:37.594
He knew how to move,

14:37.628 --> 14:40.597
without a sentence,
without a word.

14:47.104 --> 14:49.773
Armies need whores,
don't they?

14:49.840 --> 14:51.641
I used to be a whore.

14:51.742 --> 14:53.076
Don't.

14:54.578 --> 14:55.645
The truth hurts?

14:55.746 --> 14:57.614
You were a courtesan.

14:57.648 --> 15:00.083
I would not be
the son of a whore.

15:00.117 --> 15:02.819
It made you what you are.

15:02.920 --> 15:04.754
So we came from nothing.

15:04.789 --> 15:06.456
Not if your father
has his way.

15:11.595 --> 15:13.697
He has ambitions.

15:13.764 --> 15:16.333
More than even
I could have dreamed.

15:16.434 --> 15:18.268
Tell me.

15:18.402 --> 15:19.536
I can't.

15:19.603 --> 15:21.638
I fear to even
think of them.

15:21.672 --> 15:24.574
Fear? You?
I haven't heard that before.

15:24.642 --> 15:26.609
I have many fears.

15:26.644 --> 15:28.912
Most of all
about Lucrezia.

15:30.948 --> 15:32.816
Keep her safe.

15:32.917 --> 15:34.417
She can hardly move with
the guard that minds her.

15:34.452 --> 15:36.186
It minds her husband.

15:36.287 --> 15:38.088
You don't trust him?

15:38.122 --> 15:39.456
To keep her out
of harm's way?

15:39.590 --> 15:41.524
No, I don't trust him.

15:43.794 --> 15:45.662
Rome is about
to change, Mother.

15:48.432 --> 15:49.766
Not again.

15:59.143 --> 16:02.312
Rider!
Open the gates!

16:09.387 --> 16:10.787
Tell me.

16:10.855 --> 16:12.389
What do you think?

16:12.490 --> 16:14.157
It's begun.

16:14.191 --> 16:16.993
His army marching
at night from Rome.

16:17.061 --> 16:18.261
Ten days away.

16:18.329 --> 16:20.463
You can count; good,
you will need to.

16:20.498 --> 16:24.034
They are in their thousands,
equipped for a siege.

16:24.068 --> 16:27.303
Well, we have ten days
at least to prepare.

16:36.347 --> 16:37.747
Our plan,

16:37.815 --> 16:39.749
unless someone
has a better one...

16:39.817 --> 16:43.853
is to stock up on enough
supplies to outlast any siege.

16:43.888 --> 16:45.622
I want every
ounce of grain,

16:45.689 --> 16:48.158
all poultry, livestock
brought to the city.

16:50.027 --> 16:52.095
<i>Captain!</i>

16:52.163 --> 16:53.596
<i>There's movement!</i>

16:55.199 --> 16:56.366
There!

16:58.369 --> 17:00.003
<i>General! Look!</i>

17:02.706 --> 17:05.075
I want to cut all the
forests around Forli,

17:05.108 --> 17:08.411
every tree, every bush,
every hiding place.

17:08.445 --> 17:10.680
I want an open plain
below these battlements,

17:10.714 --> 17:12.248
a clear field of fire

17:12.282 --> 17:13.844
where everything that
moves is a target.

17:17.621 --> 17:19.556
Dig trenches along
these borders-

17:19.589 --> 17:21.590
here, here, and here-

17:21.625 --> 17:23.159
with a covering of
wattle, and ditches,

17:23.227 --> 17:25.428
dykes, sharpened
spikes below.

17:25.463 --> 17:26.930
My lady!
We will engage the enemy

17:27.031 --> 17:28.397
on their approach,

17:28.465 --> 17:30.600
draw them toward
the trenches -

17:30.701 --> 17:32.202
My lady,
forgive me but -

17:32.236 --> 17:36.139
-our cavalry leap the trenches,
draws their infantry in-

17:36.207 --> 17:38.167
My lady, you must -
And their cannon cannot cross.

17:39.577 --> 17:41.311
What is it?
You must see this!

17:41.412 --> 17:43.379
Can't it wait?
No.

17:43.414 --> 17:45.415
Cesare Borgia
does not wait.

17:55.192 --> 17:56.693
<i>Close the gates!</i>

17:56.760 --> 17:58.495
<i>The gates!</i>

17:58.562 --> 18:00.897
<i>Quickly! To arms!</i>

18:00.931 --> 18:02.632
You saw
his army leave Rome -

18:02.733 --> 18:04.334
ten days away.

18:04.401 --> 18:06.569
He had a second
army from France

18:06.604 --> 18:09.042
that he managed to hide
somewhere, somehow.

18:09.067 --> 18:10.740
God.

18:10.741 --> 18:13.476
We're under siege.

18:13.544 --> 18:15.645
We're under siege already,
and winter is coming.

18:23.721 --> 18:24.921
Go on.

18:24.955 --> 18:26.422
But as Christian merchants,

18:26.457 --> 18:29.425
they must also contribute
a tithe to the church.

18:29.460 --> 18:30.593
Uh-huh.

18:30.628 --> 18:32.896
They have heard
rumours that...

18:32.963 --> 18:35.598
The siege at Forli
has begun.

18:35.666 --> 18:37.567
Oh, well,
that's a surprise.

18:37.601 --> 18:39.802
The papal armies have
barely left Rome.

18:39.837 --> 18:43.106
Your son hides armies the way
a juggler hides carnations.

18:43.140 --> 18:45.475
The forests at Forli are
sprouting cannon as we speak.

18:45.576 --> 18:47.143
Oh.

18:47.178 --> 18:49.479
The Venetian ambassador
demands an audience,

18:49.513 --> 18:51.948
as do the ambassadors of
Umbria, Ferrara, Bologna,

18:52.016 --> 18:53.383
and the Holy Roman Empire.

18:53.450 --> 18:54.684
It's gonna be a busy
morning, Your Holiness.

18:54.752 --> 18:56.352
Get them to address their
questions to our son,

18:56.420 --> 18:58.288
the Gonfaloniere
of the papal armies,

18:58.322 --> 19:00.557
Duke Valentino.

19:00.624 --> 19:03.193
And where might
we find him?

19:03.260 --> 19:06.262
Well, with his armies,
we presume.

19:07.965 --> 19:09.866
Wherever they may be.

19:20.711 --> 19:23.980
You have raised a hornets'
nest, and it's not yet noon.

19:24.114 --> 19:25.715
Good.

19:25.783 --> 19:29.352
Let surprise be
our secret weapon.

19:29.453 --> 19:30.787
One army in place,

19:30.821 --> 19:34.324
another one lumbering
along in full public view.

19:34.358 --> 19:36.893
We would have
appreciated being told.

19:36.961 --> 19:38.394
Is it better to
know or not to know

19:38.495 --> 19:40.263
when you must
plead ignorance?

19:40.331 --> 19:42.665
Well, we would rather
speak the truth,

19:42.733 --> 19:45.468
if truth be told.

19:45.502 --> 19:47.170
Then I must leave
you in ignorance.

19:48.872 --> 19:51.541
There will be a price to pay
for your French involvement.

19:51.642 --> 19:53.409
Naples.

19:53.477 --> 19:55.945
The French ambassador will
be seeking an audience.

19:56.013 --> 19:59.115
Oh, well, we would happily
send Naples to the dogs

19:59.183 --> 20:01.084
if your sister
could be spared

20:01.185 --> 20:03.019
any further discomfiture.

20:10.694 --> 20:11.861
I wasn't here.

20:11.895 --> 20:12.895
What?

20:12.997 --> 20:14.364
You haven't seen me-

20:14.498 --> 20:15.665
Oh, oh -

20:15.733 --> 20:17.100
-or spoken to me.

20:17.201 --> 20:19.369
Oh, no.
We address an empty bed.

20:20.938 --> 20:23.206
We had never realized
it would provide such sport.

20:25.175 --> 20:28.878
So, remain invisible.

20:32.750 --> 20:34.951
To everyone but us.

20:46.730 --> 20:48.631
<i>Papal guard, forward.</i>

20:51.368 --> 20:52.435
<i>Steady...</i>

20:55.939 --> 20:58.574
<i>Rider! Make way!</i>

21:01.745 --> 21:03.212
<i>The Gonfaloniere!</i>

21:19.930 --> 21:21.764
Tell me your worst.

21:24.768 --> 21:26.703
Florence was so surprised

21:26.770 --> 21:29.272
by your siege at Forli,

21:29.306 --> 21:32.642
she hardly notices the army
moving past her hinterland.

21:32.743 --> 21:34.177
Hm.

21:34.244 --> 21:37.513
Can I impose on you
once more, then?

21:37.581 --> 21:40.850
Does it involve the
security of my homeland?

21:40.951 --> 21:42.518
Perhaps.

21:42.586 --> 21:45.621
King Louis of France
is at present in Milan.

21:45.656 --> 21:48.157
And he will not
long remain there.

21:48.192 --> 21:50.626
No, he wants his
beloved Naples back.

21:50.694 --> 21:52.462
And how can I
be of help

21:52.529 --> 21:54.864
with such a
terrifying prospect?

21:54.965 --> 21:57.133
You could advise him -

21:57.201 --> 21:59.435
that once I have
taken Forli,

21:59.503 --> 22:01.304
I will deal with Naples.

22:03.307 --> 22:05.641
My sister Lucrezia
will act as his regent

22:06.910 --> 22:08.344
and will rule it
in his name.

22:08.412 --> 22:11.447
Does your sister know
of her intended destiny?

22:11.515 --> 22:13.616
She is the most
capable person I know.

22:13.717 --> 22:15.618
And her husband.

22:15.652 --> 22:17.353
Will he have a role to play?

22:22.192 --> 22:24.694
I shouldn't have
asked that, should I?

22:39.510 --> 22:41.577
Hold your positions!

22:41.678 --> 22:42.979
<i>Positions!</i>

22:53.690 --> 22:55.525
<i>Hold your positions!</i>

23:12.476 --> 23:14.444
<i>I need more men!</i>

23:14.545 --> 23:16.879
Vitelli!

23:16.914 --> 23:19.048
Why the need
for siege towers?

23:19.082 --> 23:20.883
Don't you trust
your cannon?

23:20.918 --> 23:22.618
Those walls are
12 feet thick.

23:22.719 --> 23:24.754
They've never yet
been breached.

23:24.788 --> 23:26.789
So we may need
other options.

23:34.398 --> 23:37.467
You must eat, my lady.

23:39.570 --> 23:42.472
What is on offer?

23:42.573 --> 23:44.841
Trapped pigeon?

23:44.942 --> 23:46.275
Boiled rat?

23:46.376 --> 23:48.778
The usual broth...

23:48.879 --> 23:50.813
of whatever remains.

23:55.452 --> 23:57.119
What if this
is the end?

23:57.154 --> 23:59.622
I cannot believe
you say that.

23:59.723 --> 24:01.424
I've lost my son.

24:01.492 --> 24:03.259
My people starve.

24:05.229 --> 24:07.630
And freeze.

24:07.764 --> 24:09.198
Something will come.

24:09.266 --> 24:11.000
Some deus ex machina?

24:11.068 --> 24:12.201
Mm.

24:12.269 --> 24:13.590
And you've no
option but to fight.

24:14.972 --> 24:16.839
You've nothing
to negotiate with.

24:16.907 --> 24:18.808
My body?

24:20.744 --> 24:24.146
It is no longer young.

24:24.181 --> 24:26.649
But it teased him once.
Hm.

24:26.717 --> 24:28.885
I have heard
the rumours.

24:31.021 --> 24:32.722
My legend?

24:32.789 --> 24:34.757
You cannot negotiate
with that.

24:34.825 --> 24:36.559
No.

24:36.593 --> 24:38.661
No...

24:38.729 --> 24:42.198
And my legend demands
I go down in flames,

24:42.266 --> 24:44.967
or die on some blade.

24:45.068 --> 24:47.103
Or live...

24:48.505 --> 24:50.573
...in triumph.

24:52.809 --> 24:55.344
But I do not see a
triumphant outcome

24:55.412 --> 24:57.253
unless I am missing
something. Am I?

24:57.281 --> 24:58.915
It is not yet the end.

24:58.949 --> 25:00.316
No.

25:00.350 --> 25:02.485
No, these walls
are 12 foot thick.

25:02.519 --> 25:04.287
No cannon can
fell them.

25:04.354 --> 25:07.990
So our choice
is to starve...

25:08.091 --> 25:10.359
slowly...

25:10.460 --> 25:12.194
or surrender.

25:14.464 --> 25:16.165
And I will
never surrender.

25:20.103 --> 25:22.772
Promise me
one thing.

25:22.839 --> 25:24.740
Here.

25:26.310 --> 25:31.314
Whatever happens,

25:31.348 --> 25:34.350
do not let him
take me alive.

25:34.418 --> 25:36.285
I will do my utmost.

25:40.757 --> 25:43.993
And if you survive,

25:44.027 --> 25:45.428
you should consider
your future.

25:46.697 --> 25:50.166
What future?
Hm.

25:50.300 --> 25:52.301
Cesare Borgia.

25:53.870 --> 25:55.438
He may be
the future.

26:10.721 --> 26:14.690
Micheletto.

26:14.791 --> 26:16.058
Where have you been?

26:17.160 --> 26:19.161
Talking to God.

26:19.296 --> 26:20.997
And what did He say?

26:22.165 --> 26:23.699
Nothing.

26:26.169 --> 26:28.170
So you're with me
once more?

26:32.042 --> 26:34.677
You can batter those
walls for weeks.

26:34.711 --> 26:39.448
You'll have no effect.

26:39.516 --> 26:42.284
You just came
to tell me that?

26:42.352 --> 26:44.553
I was born in Forli,
do you forget?

26:47.724 --> 26:49.492
Come.

26:57.868 --> 27:00.536
There is an
old Roman quarry

27:00.570 --> 27:04.073
that runs beneath the north
tower, next to the gate.

27:04.107 --> 27:07.543
If you measure your distance,
triangulate a path,

27:07.611 --> 27:09.045
put down a marker above.

27:09.112 --> 27:11.714
Bombard that spot.

27:11.782 --> 27:14.016
That tower will fall.

27:18.021 --> 27:20.890
You can't just
leave like that.

27:20.957 --> 27:23.859
Who's to stop me?

27:23.927 --> 27:25.461
You?

27:34.604 --> 27:37.173
I'm dead.

27:39.376 --> 27:41.677
Follow the
old river bed.

27:41.712 --> 27:43.879
There is some
overhanging vines.

27:43.947 --> 27:45.614
You'll find an entrance.

27:49.753 --> 27:52.555
Goodbye,
Cesare Borgia.

28:33.230 --> 28:35.331
What is this place?

28:35.398 --> 28:37.099
It's an old Roman quarry.

28:42.239 --> 28:45.407
So...

28:45.442 --> 28:47.777
if my informant is right,

28:47.844 --> 28:49.945
the north tower is above us.

28:51.014 --> 28:52.515
And the gates
are there.

28:52.616 --> 28:54.150
And if he's wrong?

28:54.184 --> 28:56.652
Well, if he's wrong,
he's wrong.

28:56.753 --> 28:58.621
Let's assume he's right.

28:58.688 --> 29:01.824
How do we measure it?

29:01.858 --> 29:03.626
We would have
to pace it out,

29:03.660 --> 29:05.761
figure out north
by northwest.

29:05.796 --> 29:09.365
And then triangulate.

29:09.466 --> 29:10.666
Let's get
to work then.

29:13.937 --> 29:19.108
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight...

29:19.142 --> 29:21.577
This can work but
we have to be exact.

29:21.611 --> 29:24.213
It's 248 steps-
Northwest.

29:24.281 --> 29:26.715
- Northwest. Exactly.
- It's never going to work.

29:26.783 --> 29:29.185
No, it can work! It can work.
How can you be so sure?

29:29.252 --> 29:31.153
If you don't believe,
just sit back and watch.

29:32.155 --> 29:34.290
I never thought I'd
see you holding this.

29:34.357 --> 29:36.125
Not for long.

29:41.598 --> 29:43.165
<i>Here, my lady.</i>

29:47.671 --> 29:49.338
Five, six, seven...

29:49.439 --> 29:50.973
Here.

29:54.678 --> 29:56.779
One hundred and twenty,
twenty-one...

30:05.388 --> 30:06.822
I should kill you now!

30:08.325 --> 30:09.658
You can.

30:09.693 --> 30:11.894
But I bear a white flag.
You could also talk...

30:11.962 --> 30:14.163
Not with a Borgia.

30:14.197 --> 30:16.832
I've had duplicity
enough for a lifetime.

30:16.900 --> 30:18.334
I am not my brother,
Catherina.

30:18.368 --> 30:22.338
<i>No, you do not torture boys -</i>

30:22.372 --> 30:23.572
<i>you kill them.</i>

30:26.309 --> 30:27.409
He was under arms.

30:27.477 --> 30:29.345
There are many -
thousands -

30:29.379 --> 30:31.313
within these walls who are not.
Ah.

30:31.348 --> 30:34.016
There are boundaries
you draw.

30:34.050 --> 30:36.385
Don't you even want
to hear my terms?

30:36.486 --> 30:38.454
I think I know them.

30:38.488 --> 30:41.156
But refresh my memory.
<i>Surrender -</i>

30:41.191 --> 30:42.892
you, your arms,
your castle -

30:42.993 --> 30:44.426
and I will spare the populace.

30:44.494 --> 30:46.328
As I told your
dead brother,

30:46.396 --> 30:49.498
I will never bow to
the whoremaster of Rome.

30:53.136 --> 30:55.571
<i>Shields!</i>
<i>Back!</i>

30:57.741 --> 30:59.275
To the line!

30:59.342 --> 31:00.903
<i>Get out of range!</i>
<i>Out of range! Come on!</i>

31:03.179 --> 31:04.647
<i>Ready ranks!</i>

31:06.182 --> 31:07.683
<i>Open the line!</i>
<i>Open!</i>

31:10.086 --> 31:11.487
My lord.
Did I pace it right?

31:11.554 --> 31:13.389
I counted; 248.

31:13.423 --> 31:15.691
And the direction?
I checked. Northwest.

31:17.360 --> 31:19.328
Let me be clear on this.

31:19.396 --> 31:21.430
You want to strike the
ground beneath the wall,

31:21.531 --> 31:23.198
not the wall itself.

31:23.233 --> 31:25.301
The white flag.

31:25.368 --> 31:26.869
Be prepared for laughter.

31:26.937 --> 31:28.604
Derision.

31:29.372 --> 31:31.440
- I'd welcome it.
<i>- Preparez les cannon!</i>

31:38.415 --> 31:39.415
Load it up!

31:41.184 --> 31:42.418
<i>Aim...</i>

31:53.330 --> 31:54.663
- Fire!
<i>- Fire!</i>

32:02.739 --> 32:04.379
<i>Ah, it's too short.</i>
<i>Out of range.</i>

32:07.477 --> 32:08.978
<i>Change the range!</i>

32:12.148 --> 32:13.515
It's target practice!

32:13.650 --> 32:14.750
Couldn't even hit that!

32:16.252 --> 32:17.686
Once more!
Reload!

32:18.722 --> 32:20.389
Fire!

32:25.228 --> 32:26.562
Well done!
Bulls-eye!

32:26.663 --> 32:28.497
Give him a prize!

32:37.507 --> 32:39.575
En guard!
<i>Preparez!</i>

32:39.676 --> 32:41.577
Reload!
Fire!

32:50.086 --> 32:51.320
Again, again!

32:51.354 --> 32:52.788
<i>Again!</i>
<i>Fire!</i>

33:03.366 --> 33:04.633
Again!

33:05.902 --> 33:07.736
Fire!

33:07.837 --> 33:09.171
Faster!

33:09.205 --> 33:10.706
Light it up!
Fire!

33:25.355 --> 33:27.389
<i>Reload!</i>
<i>Reload!</i>

33:36.766 --> 33:38.534
Fire!

34:00.723 --> 34:02.991
What's happened?
<i>Captain, we're moving!</i>

34:03.059 --> 34:04.426
Take a look!
<i>What's that sound?</i>

34:04.527 --> 34:05.561
<i>I don't know!</i>

34:16.773 --> 34:18.072
Get back!

34:26.315 --> 34:27.449
<i>Move!</i>
<i>All of you!</i>

34:30.753 --> 34:32.654
<i>The wall is down!</i>

34:36.126 --> 34:38.092
Oh ye of little faith.

34:38.128 --> 34:39.928
Get the armies in line.

34:39.996 --> 34:41.429
Now it begins.

34:57.914 --> 35:00.015
<i>Form up!</i>
<i>Prepare the attack!</i>

35:00.083 --> 35:02.017
<i>En formation!</i>
<i>Present arms!</i>

35:02.118 --> 35:03.452
<i>Arms!</i>

35:03.486 --> 35:05.154
NOW!

35:07.657 --> 35:09.091
Present arms!

35:11.494 --> 35:12.528
Charge!

35:12.629 --> 35:13.795
Attack!

35:13.830 --> 35:16.565
Attack!

35:55.004 --> 35:56.672
<i>Ride them down!</i>

36:22.198 --> 36:23.799
Come along, hurry!

36:38.548 --> 36:40.749
<i>Attack!</i>

37:12.382 --> 37:13.548
<i>Stop!</i>

37:15.285 --> 37:16.718
Stop!

37:16.753 --> 37:18.387
<i>Slow down! Halt!</i>

37:21.824 --> 37:23.492
Stop!
<i>Hold your arms!</i>

37:23.559 --> 37:25.460
Stop!
I don't want a massacre.

37:26.729 --> 37:29.197
You want me?
You want me?

37:31.401 --> 37:33.535
Have me.

37:33.569 --> 37:36.104
Blow me into
a thousand pieces!

37:37.073 --> 37:39.241
Come on, aim your bows,
every one of them.

37:39.275 --> 37:41.543
I want to sprout
a hundred arrows.

37:41.577 --> 37:43.912
Like a porcupine!

37:43.946 --> 37:45.514
Aim for the rope.

37:45.581 --> 37:47.316
Come on!

37:47.383 --> 37:48.917
You can have
your life, Catherina.

37:48.985 --> 37:50.218
No...

37:50.286 --> 37:51.820
...but I don't
want it anymore.

37:53.456 --> 37:55.090
Come on, give me
a legendary death.

38:08.771 --> 38:10.605
Does it take
a Catherina Sforza

38:10.673 --> 38:12.641
to kill a
Catherina Sforza?

38:20.783 --> 38:22.284
Damn you, Spanish
half-breed!

38:23.953 --> 38:25.354
You will live.

38:25.455 --> 38:27.656
I insist.
Why?

38:27.690 --> 38:29.991
Because I want you to.

38:52.348 --> 38:54.216
The key.

39:06.963 --> 39:08.497
I should have stabbed
you on this bed.

39:08.631 --> 39:11.466
We both know that.

39:11.534 --> 39:12.734
But you didn't.

39:12.802 --> 39:13.935
Ow.

39:24.947 --> 39:26.948
Do not touch my dresses!

39:29.485 --> 39:32.087
Forgive me.

39:32.155 --> 39:34.656
But I would not have you
seen in public like...

39:34.724 --> 39:36.158
...that.

39:40.830 --> 39:44.199
Why do you care?

39:44.300 --> 39:46.835
I have tamed a legend.

39:46.869 --> 39:49.337
The Tigress of Forli.

39:49.405 --> 39:51.206
I would have you
dress to the occasion.

39:57.079 --> 39:58.346
Yellow and black.

39:59.582 --> 40:01.349
Tiger stripes.

40:07.523 --> 40:08.723
Forward!

40:10.860 --> 40:12.327
Make her a cage.

40:12.395 --> 40:13.862
A golden one.

40:13.896 --> 40:17.966
Line it with ermine and
black satin like a hearse.

40:18.034 --> 40:20.402
Have it pulled by liveried,
feathered horses.

40:20.503 --> 40:22.671
I want her entry to Rome
to be spectacular.

40:22.705 --> 40:25.207
We have captured a legend.
She should be seen as one.

40:25.341 --> 40:26.741
And then?

40:26.776 --> 40:30.912
I will prepare premises
in the Castel St. Angelo.

40:31.013 --> 40:33.281
Her prison can
become her castle;

40:33.349 --> 40:34.716
she deserves
nothing less.

40:36.185 --> 40:38.587
She had an assassin, didn't she?

40:38.721 --> 40:39.754
Rufio.

40:39.856 --> 40:41.990
A master of
the art of death.

40:42.058 --> 40:43.558
Is he among
this sorry lot?

40:43.626 --> 40:44.993
Yes.

40:45.061 --> 40:47.229
Then see this Rufio
is sent to Rome as well.

40:52.268 --> 40:54.236
Come, but don't claw me.

40:55.705 --> 40:57.506
I have no claws left.

40:57.573 --> 40:58.940
Then take my hand.

41:03.613 --> 41:05.981
No.
Take my arm.

41:06.048 --> 41:09.484
This is my wake,
not my wedding.

41:09.552 --> 41:11.152
Still,
take it.

41:11.254 --> 41:12.420
Why?

41:12.455 --> 41:14.256
You took it once.

41:44.420 --> 41:45.754
My lady.

42:21.290 --> 42:23.124
Welcome to Rome!

42:41.811 --> 42:43.378
<i>Good day, my lady!</i>

43:42.004 --> 43:44.072
Would it not have
been simpler, my lady,

43:44.173 --> 43:48.777
to have come of
your own free will?

43:48.844 --> 43:51.112
I'm sure in the end
it would've been the same.

43:51.213 --> 43:53.381
Hm.

43:53.416 --> 43:55.450
Am I to be put
to the rack?

43:55.551 --> 43:57.385
No.

43:57.453 --> 44:00.722
We have rooms prepared
for you above.

44:00.856 --> 44:04.359
Fit for your station.

44:04.393 --> 44:08.930
With a beautiful
view of St. Peters.

44:08.964 --> 44:11.399
Don't be so rash,
Your Holiness.

44:11.434 --> 44:12.901
Hm.

44:13.035 --> 44:14.569
I still have teeth.

44:20.476 --> 44:21.910
Hm.

44:26.816 --> 44:28.616
Release him
from the wall.

44:39.628 --> 44:41.830
Have they
abused you, Rufio?

44:44.567 --> 44:46.768
I had a man
like you once.

44:46.802 --> 44:49.070
Capable of any task.

44:49.138 --> 44:50.472
Beyond virtue.

44:50.606 --> 44:53.041
Beyond good and evil.

44:53.109 --> 44:56.678
Beyond everything
but loyalty.

45:05.855 --> 45:08.389
I asked you to meet me
in confession, Father.

45:08.457 --> 45:10.158
Because you have sinned.

45:10.192 --> 45:14.395
No, because it is the only
place I cannot be overheard.

45:14.463 --> 45:15.997
My brother has his
spies everywhere.

45:17.466 --> 45:20.502
Should I put myself forward?

45:20.536 --> 45:22.437
You seem unbreakable.
I like that.

45:24.273 --> 45:26.107
Is this an offer
of employment?

45:27.676 --> 45:30.445
I could set you a task,
see how you perform.

45:33.783 --> 45:35.283
Tell me.

45:37.486 --> 45:39.454
I've been a bad wife.

45:39.588 --> 45:43.024
You have strayed?

45:43.092 --> 45:46.728
As I sd, Father, this
confession is false.

45:46.796 --> 45:49.831
As everything
around us is false.

45:49.899 --> 45:54.636
But I asked you
here to meet with me

45:54.670 --> 45:58.807
to tell me privately
just one true thing.

46:00.910 --> 46:04.512
I need someone
done away with.

46:06.282 --> 46:11.085
In such a way that suspicion
can never rest on me,

46:11.120 --> 46:14.122
my family,
anyone to do with me.

46:14.156 --> 46:16.524
Do you have a name?

46:16.592 --> 46:20.195
It is rumoured that Cesare
has designs on Naples.

46:20.262 --> 46:22.564
I know that you have
had some dealings

46:22.631 --> 46:24.265
with the French King.

46:24.300 --> 46:28.770
If all of this is true, then
my husband is as good as dead.

46:30.606 --> 46:33.942
Alfonso of Naples,
Prince of Bisceglie.

46:34.009 --> 46:36.010
Husband to your sister.

46:36.145 --> 46:37.979
Yes.

46:38.047 --> 46:40.548
And you want to use me.

46:40.649 --> 46:43.384
That's clever.

46:43.452 --> 46:46.321
And if I'm caught
at the task?

46:46.388 --> 46:48.656
Will you be?

46:48.691 --> 46:49.991
What do you think?

46:54.029 --> 46:55.496
You should not
listen to rumour.

46:55.531 --> 46:58.199
I have no other confidante.

46:58.267 --> 47:03.004
And this is a simple
inquiry from a daughter

47:03.038 --> 47:06.074
to a father...

47:06.141 --> 47:08.142
who once believed that
she was close to his heart.

47:08.210 --> 47:09.310
There is no one closer-

47:09.345 --> 47:13.281
Oh, don't lie to me, Father.

47:13.349 --> 47:16.351
Now that your ambition
is at one with my brother's,

47:16.418 --> 47:19.854
then that ambition is
multiplied tenfold.

47:21.190 --> 47:23.758
So I ask again about Naples.

47:36.438 --> 47:38.573
That silence is my answer.

48:02.631 --> 48:04.299
Time to go home.
My lord.

48:10.439 --> 48:12.407
Lucrezia?

48:19.815 --> 48:21.416
Lucrezia!

48:27.790 --> 48:29.324
Lucrezia!

48:35.998 --> 48:37.665
Lucrezia!
<i>She's indisposed.</i>

48:38.801 --> 48:41.002
Alfonso.

48:41.070 --> 48:43.004
I told her I would be
coming here tonight.

48:43.072 --> 48:47.075
<i>Come to release us?</i>
<i>Is that it?</i>

48:47.142 --> 48:48.509
To release me, finally.

48:50.612 --> 48:52.246
Yes.

48:53.115 --> 48:55.783
Yes, you're free to go.
Free?

48:57.786 --> 48:59.053
The city is yours.

48:59.121 --> 49:02.090
Without shadow?
Go wherever you want-alone.

49:05.627 --> 49:07.495
The way your
brother went?

49:08.630 --> 49:09.864
I warn you.

49:09.932 --> 49:12.800
An anonymous blade,
a splash in the Tiber-

49:12.935 --> 49:14.135
or was the blade your own?

49:14.269 --> 49:15.336
Brother!

49:15.371 --> 49:17.705
Prince to you,
not brother!

49:17.806 --> 49:19.273
Husband to your sister!

49:20.876 --> 49:21.976
Enough!

49:23.612 --> 49:25.279
Of course you
love your sister!

49:27.983 --> 49:29.884
Too much.

49:34.056 --> 49:35.690
Stop!

49:40.129 --> 49:41.329
Oh God!

49:44.933 --> 49:46.467
Oh God!

49:51.440 --> 49:52.607
No!

49:53.642 --> 49:55.076
No.
No!

49:55.144 --> 49:57.145
It's not what you think.
No! Brother, no!

49:57.179 --> 49:58.513
No! No!

49:59.648 --> 50:01.082
He challenged me.
No!

50:01.150 --> 50:02.450
He tried to run me through
and he fell onto my blade.

50:02.484 --> 50:04.385
No! Let me go!
Call a medic!

50:04.486 --> 50:06.020
Call a medic!

50:07.189 --> 50:08.856
No! No!

50:08.991 --> 50:10.324
Go!

50:10.359 --> 50:11.492
He's killed me...

50:16.165 --> 50:17.999
He has killed me, love.
No. No.

50:18.100 --> 50:19.367
He has killed me-

50:19.468 --> 50:21.302
just as you both wanted.
No.

50:21.437 --> 50:22.837
I should never...

50:22.938 --> 50:24.672
I should have never
loved you...

50:24.706 --> 50:28.142
I should have
never loved you...

50:28.177 --> 50:30.178
I should have never
loved you...

50:34.149 --> 50:36.284
I can't feel my hands!

50:36.286 --> 50:37.985
My side's burning!

50:39.788 --> 50:43.391
Give me something -

50:43.459 --> 50:45.593
Give me something -
anything!

50:45.627 --> 50:47.128
Sh, sh.

50:49.031 --> 50:51.632
Chew on this -
chew, chew!

50:53.936 --> 50:56.003
Okay, my love.

50:57.873 --> 50:59.340
For the pain!
For the pain.

51:00.843 --> 51:02.944
Hold still.
Hold for a moment.

51:05.714 --> 51:09.517
Wait here, I may yet
need a professional.

51:25.234 --> 51:26.801
Stay still.

51:26.835 --> 51:28.769
What can you do?
Nothing.

51:28.837 --> 51:32.006
Let it run its course.
It could take days.

51:34.710 --> 51:36.110
Ah, my love.

51:36.178 --> 51:37.712
Leave him with
his family then.

51:45.587 --> 51:48.556
I know you have the means
to end this agony.

51:48.657 --> 51:51.259
So if you ever loved me,

51:51.360 --> 51:54.395
you'll do me this
one last favour.

51:54.496 --> 51:56.030
I cannot.

51:56.064 --> 51:59.500
Yes, you can!

51:59.568 --> 52:01.102
You're a Borgia.

52:34.603 --> 52:37.038
Is that all I am now,
Brother?

52:38.674 --> 52:40.041
A Borgia.

52:49.284 --> 52:51.385
A professional.

53:08.370 --> 53:10.071
Lucrezia?

53:12.975 --> 53:14.575
Lucrezia.

53:16.111 --> 53:17.245
Lucrezia!

53:25.787 --> 53:27.755
I will never
wash this blood away.

53:30.926 --> 53:33.227
Then I must.

53:47.175 --> 53:49.944
You will be naked...

53:50.012 --> 53:52.146
and clean...

53:52.247 --> 53:54.248
and bloodless again.

54:01.890 --> 54:04.258
And mine.
