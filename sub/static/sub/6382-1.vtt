Night, Bill.

48:30.200 --> 48:33.613
So my sister's ex—boyfriend
might've just turned into...

48:33.828 --> 48:38.288
...some kind of evil vampire
god monster thing.

48:38.500 --> 48:43.244
Yeah, maybe I was
too hard on her.

48:43.463 --> 48:46.921
Maybe she was right.
Maybe I am going crazy.

48:53.515 --> 48:55.130
Remember that one?

48:55.350 --> 48:56.806
-No.
-Well, that's okay.

48:57.018 --> 48:59.304
It's not much
like that movie anyway.

48:59.521 --> 49:01.261
I don't see all dead people.

49:01.481 --> 49:04.848
Just my parents telling me to do stuff.

49:05.068 --> 49:10.313
And they've gotten kinda racist and scary
since they went to heaven.

49:17.872 --> 49:22.332
Anyway, my Sister, she'd have me
hauled off to the bunny ranch...

49:22.544 --> 49:24.785
...and put in one
of them straitjackets.

49:25.004 --> 49:28.667
Then who'd be there to stop
Warlow from coming after her?

49:28.883 --> 49:32.546
You cannot keep Warlow
away from Sookie.

49:34.013 --> 49:35.628
How do you know
my sister's name?

49:35.807 --> 49:39.516
Heh, heh. Who the hell do you
think I am, Jason?
