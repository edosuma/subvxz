00:34.965 --> 00:38.299
Welcome to the 6:00 news,
in our brand-new studio.

00:38.469 --> 00:40.545
Looking good, Springfield.

00:43.349 --> 00:46.883
In today's news, a 2-ton rhino
escaped from the Springfield Zoo.

00:47.610 --> 00:48.887
But zoo officials were quick to act...

00:49.630 --> 00:53.310
...and Petunia, as she is known,
is safely back in captivity.

00:54.526 --> 00:56.151
In other news, a 3-ton rhino...

00:56.320 --> 00:59.720
...that escaped from the zoo last week
is still at large.

01:01.325 --> 01:03.680
All right, who broke my vase?

01:03.243 --> 01:05.913
Who took my tests off the refrigerator
and tore them up?

01:06.800 --> 01:09.330
Who spread garbage all over
Flanders' yard before I got a chance to?

01:09.500 --> 01:11.991
Oh, please.
This is senseless destruction...

01:12.169 --> 01:14.292
...with none of my usual
social commentary.

01:16.507 --> 01:18.998
If it wasn't you, then who was it?

01:20.427 --> 01:23.677
I'm sure these things didn't destroy
themselves, now, did they?

01:23.847 --> 01:25.507
Did they?

01:30.270 --> 01:33.580
I guess Bart's not to blame.
He's lucky too...

01:33.232 --> 01:37.312
...because it's spanking season, and
I got a hankering for some spankering.

01:39.571 --> 01:41.694
I don't know why you're
so energetic today...

01:41.865 --> 01:44.154
...but prepare to be worn out.

01:48.872 --> 01:52.491
What's wrong, boy? Getting tired?

02:05.973 --> 02:09.139
I think there's really something wrong
with Santa's Little Helper.

02:09.310 --> 02:12.643
He was up barking all night and dug up
the back yard worse than ever.

02:13.814 --> 02:16.850
- My bongo drums!
- My strobe light!

02:17.260 --> 02:19.861
My Best of Ray Stevens,
featuring "The Streak," album.

02:20.154 --> 02:22.858
So it was the dog
that buried all our stuff.

02:23.320 --> 02:24.941
Yes, the dog.

02:26.827 --> 02:30.659
Oh, my God! He's got
the precious cable-TV cable!

02:35.210 --> 02:37.203
Always use fresh macaroni.

02:39.480 --> 02:40.874
If the box rattles, throw it away.

02:43.510 --> 02:46.180
Your cable TV
is experiencing difficulties.

02:46.347 --> 02:47.841
Please do not panic.

02:48.150 --> 02:51.135
Resist the temptation to read
or talk to loved ones.

02:51.310 --> 02:53.101
Do not attempt sexual relations...

02:53.270 --> 02:58.146
...as years of TV radiation have left
your genitals withered and useless.

02:58.317 --> 02:59.645
Well, I'll be damned.

03:05.115 --> 03:08.330
Excuse me. We're having
a problem with our dog.

03:08.202 --> 03:10.444
I'll tell you what I'm telling
everyone else.

03:10.621 --> 03:14.701
I'm sorry if your dog went blind, but your
gripe is with Hartz Mountain, not me.

03:14.875 --> 03:17.544
No. No, our dog is out of control.

03:17.711 --> 03:22.500
He's wild, destructive and has little
or no respect for authority.

03:22.675 --> 03:25.379
Let me try a canine-human mind meld.

03:25.552 --> 03:29.218
It's an incredibly rare psychic power
possessed only by me...

03:29.390 --> 03:31.596
...and three other clerks at this store.

03:31.767 --> 03:33.594
Okay.

03:38.315 --> 03:41.400
I'm bored. I'm restless.

03:41.568 --> 03:43.442
Need change in life...

03:44.530 --> 03:47.614
...like imported leather leash...

03:47.783 --> 03:50.250
...blue contact lenses...

03:50.202 --> 03:52.693
...200-volt-shock training collar.

03:53.414 --> 03:56.580
Well, problem solved.

03:57.710 --> 04:00.960
- Homer, hold on to the wheel!
- You got it.

04:03.257 --> 04:04.917
Hey!

04:06.552 --> 04:10.300
Don't worry. We'll catch him
or run him over trying.

04:10.222 --> 04:13.342
He's headed to the greyhound
racing track where we found him.

04:13.517 --> 04:16.185
Don't worry, when they find out
he doesn't have money...

04:16.353 --> 04:19.140
...they'll throw him out.
Believe me, I know.

04:25.738 --> 04:27.564
This place is so big.

04:27.906 --> 04:30.742
Do you think we should split up
and look for him, Homie?

04:30.909 --> 04:33.946
- Homie?
- Two bucks to win on number eight.

04:34.121 --> 04:38.664
And have you seen my beloved dog?
Give me the ticket.

04:40.850 --> 04:43.834
We can't lose.
Look at the name of the dog I bet on.

04:44.600 --> 04:45.797
"She's the Fastest."

04:45.966 --> 04:47.959
I don't think that means, necessarily...

04:48.135 --> 04:51.504
And they're off. She's the Fastest
jumps out to an insurmountable lead.

04:51.680 --> 04:53.803
You're lucky you got looks, Marge.

04:53.974 --> 04:56.500
Around the far turn,
it's She's the Fastest.

04:56.226 --> 04:58.931
Followed by Always Comes in Second
and I'm Number Three.

04:59.104 --> 05:00.812
Yes! Come on, you little horse!

05:01.440 --> 05:05.485
And they're in the home stretch. It's...
Wait! Another dog is on the track.

05:05.653 --> 05:07.645
- Santa's Little Helper!
- The mystery dog...

05:07.821 --> 05:11.273
...gaining fast on the outside.
Of course, he could never win this race.

05:11.450 --> 05:13.324
Or could he?

05:20.793 --> 05:24.162
What's Santa's Little Helper
doing to that dog?

05:24.338 --> 05:27.707
Looks like he's trying to jump over her,
but he can't quite make it.

05:27.883 --> 05:29.508
Come on, boy! You can do it!

05:29.677 --> 05:31.550
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the end.

05:31.720 --> 05:33.962
This is the end of dog racing.

05:35.808 --> 05:38.346
I think they're in love.

05:45.150 --> 05:47.855
So that's what's been wrong
with the little fella.

05:48.280 --> 05:50.698
He misses casual sex.

05:50.864 --> 05:53.710
- Can we keep Santa's girlfriend, Mom?
- Please?

05:53.242 --> 05:56.408
- But she's not our dog.
- She's yours now.

05:56.578 --> 05:59.496
Once they fall in love,
they lose their racing spirit.

05:59.665 --> 06:02.950
Won't you miss her loyalty
and companionship?

06:06.547 --> 06:09.417
Lady, you're all right.

06:12.594 --> 06:14.552
Okay, you can go out and play.

06:14.722 --> 06:17.925
But no more you-know-what
in front of the house, all right?

06:18.475 --> 06:20.848
Hey! What did I just say?

06:54.178 --> 06:55.886
Take it. It fell on the floor.

07:12.363 --> 07:14.230
Hey, boy, you wanna play fetch?

07:16.700 --> 07:18.942
Me and Santa's Little Helper
used to be a team.

07:19.119 --> 07:22.370
But he never wants to play anymore
since his bitch moved in.

07:22.206 --> 07:26.380
- Don't ever say that word again.
- Well, that's what she is. I looked it up.

07:26.210 --> 07:29.661
Well, I'm going to write the dictionary
people and have that checked.

07:29.838 --> 07:31.831
Feels like a mistake to me.

07:32.424 --> 07:36.837
Hey, look. A really small dog
just fell out of Santa's girlfriend.

07:37.120 --> 07:39.420
Oh, my God! She's having babies!

07:39.598 --> 07:42.848
Oh, I'm sorry, girl.
I thought you were just getting fat.

07:43.180 --> 07:46.304
- Look, it's twins!
- No, it's two sets of twins.

07:46.480 --> 07:48.556
- Two sets of twins and a triplet.
- Homer.

07:48.732 --> 07:51.982
Homer, find a place
for all these little miracles.

08:05.833 --> 08:09.451
Oh, my. I've never seen
anything like this.

08:09.628 --> 08:11.122
How many more can there be?

08:11.297 --> 08:13.254
Twenty-two.

08:13.424 --> 08:15.547
Twenty-three.

08:15.718 --> 08:17.426
Twenty-four.

08:23.642 --> 08:26.596
Twenty-five.

08:38.323 --> 08:40.611
Twenty-five puppies.

08:44.538 --> 08:46.696
An army of dogs!

08:46.874 --> 08:49.958
No bully will ever touch me again.

08:51.795 --> 08:53.289
Hey, jerkface.

08:53.464 --> 08:56.251
You have the face of a jerk.

08:56.675 --> 08:59.380
- All right, Simpson, you asked for...
- Get him, boys.

09:05.934 --> 09:07.892
Say, Jimbo...

09:08.620 --> 09:11.727
...hope I wasn't out of line
with that "jerkface" crack.

09:31.710 --> 09:34.248
Oh, Homie, aren't they adorable?

09:34.421 --> 09:36.995
Yes. We waited many years...

09:37.174 --> 09:41.800
...but the good Lord has finally
blessed us with a real family.

09:53.357 --> 09:56.560
Look at Branford II. Isn't that cute?

09:56.735 --> 09:58.728
He thinks he's one of the Models Inc.

10:02.449 --> 10:04.691
Get that cat out of the way!

10:11.830 --> 10:12.542
My socks.

10:21.260 --> 10:23.383
Mom, why do I have to wear
a flea collar?

10:23.554 --> 10:25.178
Oh, it's just easier this way.

10:40.946 --> 10:42.903
This time...

10:47.161 --> 10:48.869
This house stinks.

10:49.380 --> 10:51.789
Are you just putting new newspapers
over the old ones?

10:51.957 --> 10:54.579
Do you have a better idea?

10:55.440 --> 10:58.329
Now, I know we love the puppies
very much...

10:58.505 --> 11:00.831
...but I think they're getting
to be a problem.

11:01.800 --> 11:04.341
Yeah, they ate all my socks.
I have to wear Lisa's to school today.

11:04.511 --> 11:07.927
- How do you explain the culottes, boy?
- I have to coordinate, don't I?

11:08.980 --> 11:10.470
We've been thinking about
giving the puppies away.

11:10.642 --> 11:12.968
- No!
- Mainly your mother.

11:13.145 --> 11:14.853
Is that what we do in this family?

11:15.220 --> 11:18.391
When someone becomes an
inconvenience, we just get rid of them?

11:22.488 --> 11:26.485
Hello? Is anybody there?

11:30.162 --> 11:32.867
All right, we'll give the dogs
one more chance.

11:33.400 --> 11:37.369
As long as the puppies don't do
anything else wrong, they stay.

11:37.586 --> 11:39.378
On a completely unrelated topic...

11:39.546 --> 11:42.382
...I'm having a very, very important
dinner party tonight.

11:42.549 --> 11:44.589
Splendid. Who's coming?

11:44.760 --> 11:47.333
Reverend Lovejoy,
your old Army drill sergeant...

11:47.513 --> 11:50.300
...and the regional director of the IRS.

11:52.685 --> 11:54.761
Oh, just lovely, Marge.

11:54.937 --> 11:57.642
The whole town will hear
what a perfect evening this was.

11:57.815 --> 12:00.140
- How nothing at all went wrong.
- Simpson.

12:00.317 --> 12:03.104
This evening has gone so flawlessly,
I'm gonna forget...

12:03.279 --> 12:05.816
...that you were mistakenly
let out of the Army early.

12:05.990 --> 12:08.278
I'm so impressed
by this problem-free evening...

12:08.450 --> 12:12.744
...that there's no need for that audit.
- A toast to the Simpsons.

12:12.913 --> 12:14.573
And to the delectable turkey...

12:14.748 --> 12:17.453
...that's walking around the table!

12:17.626 --> 12:19.666
Dear Lord, it's a demon bird.

12:27.177 --> 12:31.175
Simpson! See you at reveille,
0500 tomorrow.

12:31.348 --> 12:33.341
See you at the IRS.

12:33.517 --> 12:35.308
See you in hell.

12:35.477 --> 12:36.509
From heaven.

12:42.568 --> 12:46.352
Well, we sure could use a pooch
to guard the flock at the Flanderosa.

12:46.530 --> 12:50.113
It'd be nice to have some companionship
when Mother goes out on dates.

12:50.284 --> 12:52.573
We could use a new pet
over at the home...

12:52.745 --> 12:56.908
...seeing how we accidentally
killed that smart-mouthed bird.

13:01.712 --> 13:03.539
They don't like being broken up.

13:03.714 --> 13:05.753
We've got to be realistic, kids.

13:05.924 --> 13:09.708
Who's gonna have a big enough heart
to take care of 25 puppies?

13:10.638 --> 13:14.849
And I know the little fellas would love
romping around my many acres...

13:15.170 --> 13:16.511
...chasing my many cars...

13:16.685 --> 13:19.354
...drinking from my many toilets.
- Who wouldn't?

13:19.730 --> 13:23.728
Mom, don't give the puppies to him.
He'll be mean to them.

13:23.901 --> 13:27.981
She's right, Homer. There's
something about his face I don't trust.

13:32.868 --> 13:34.825
I'm sorry, Mr. Burns...

13:34.995 --> 13:39.574
...but you can't have these dogs.
Am I fired?

13:40.292 --> 13:41.834
Oh, of course not.

13:42.200 --> 13:44.244
They're your pets.
You can do as you wish.

13:44.421 --> 13:45.915
Good day, everyone.

13:47.841 --> 13:52.384
- My, he certainly took that well.
- A little too well, if you ask me.

13:52.554 --> 13:56.504
I'm sure he's plotting some
brilliant scheme to get those puppies.

13:57.685 --> 14:01.552
There you go. There you go. You too.

14:01.730 --> 14:06.108
Honestly, sir, you don't put the effort
into your schemes that you used to.

14:17.913 --> 14:20.119
Don't worry, folks,
we'll find your wallet.

14:20.290 --> 14:24.419
Dogs. Chief, you're getting
powdered sugar all over my floor.

14:24.586 --> 14:26.912
No, I'm not. No, I'm not.

14:27.798 --> 14:30.870
I'm dusting for prints.

14:30.300 --> 14:31.795
We don't have to wait for cops.

14:31.969 --> 14:34.376
Who can track them better
than their mom and dad?

14:34.555 --> 14:36.346
Let's go find your babies.

14:38.600 --> 14:41.270
Dinner's on, dogs.

14:43.147 --> 14:47.310
I'm sorry, kids. I don't think we're
ever gonna find your greyhounds.

14:47.484 --> 14:51.778
Maybe Mr. Burns will sell you
one of the 25 he got last night.

15:06.860 --> 15:09.870
Who knows what horrible things he's
doing to those innocent little puppies.

15:20.170 --> 15:24.809
There. Now, wasn't that heavenly?
And don't you feel better too?

15:25.689 --> 15:27.433
He's giving them a bath.

15:27.775 --> 15:29.269
There you are.

15:29.443 --> 15:32.527
There you go, little fella. And you.

15:36.575 --> 15:38.781
Smithers, look. He's standing up.

15:39.995 --> 15:43.495
I've never seen anything so adorable.
You know who it reminds me of?

15:43.666 --> 15:45.410
- Benji?
- No.

15:45.209 --> 15:46.703
- Lassie?
- No, no.

15:46.877 --> 15:49.582
- A person. You know who I mean.
- Snoop Doggy Dogg?

15:49.755 --> 15:52.626
- Bob Barker? David Brenner?
- No, no.

15:52.800 --> 15:55.884
The person who's always
standing and walking.

15:56.530 --> 15:58.805
- Rory Calhoun?
- That's it!

15:59.348 --> 16:03.180
You stay with me.
You're the pick of the litter.

16:06.605 --> 16:09.891
Maybe we were wrong about Burns
on this one.

16:12.152 --> 16:14.525
Are you sure you wanna
go through with this, sir?

16:14.697 --> 16:17.152
You do have a very full wardrobe
as it is.

16:17.324 --> 16:22.235
Yes. But not completely full.
For, you see:

16:22.413 --> 16:25.283
Some men hunt for sport

16:25.457 --> 16:27.746
Others hunt for food

16:27.918 --> 16:32.545
The only thing I'm hunting for

16:33.257 --> 16:39.129
Is an outfit that looks good

16:42.474 --> 16:46.638
See my vest
See my vest

16:46.812 --> 16:48.686
Made from real gorilla chest

16:48.856 --> 16:52.770
Feel this sweater, there's no better
Than authentic Irish setter

16:52.943 --> 16:54.568
See this hat
'Twas my cat

16:54.778 --> 16:56.937
My evening wear, vampire bat

16:57.114 --> 17:00.815
These white slippers
Are albino African endangered rhino

17:00.993 --> 17:04.859
Grizzly-bear underwear
Turtles ' necks, I've got my share

17:05.390 --> 17:08.739
Beret of poodle
On my noodle it shall rest

17:08.916 --> 17:12.915
Try my red-robin suit
It comes one breast or two

17:13.880 --> 17:14.832
See my vest
See my vest

17:15.700 --> 17:17.829
See my vest

17:20.179 --> 17:25.256
Like my loafers?
Former gophers

17:25.434 --> 17:27.675
It was that or skin my chauffeurs

17:27.853 --> 17:31.187
But a greyhound-fur tuxedo
Would be best

17:31.357 --> 17:34.808
- So let's prepare these dogs
- Kill two for matching clogs

17:34.985 --> 17:38.700
See my vest
See my vest

17:38.238 --> 17:45.119
Oh, please, won 't you see my vest?

17:45.454 --> 17:48.289
- I really like the vest.
- I gathered, yeah.

17:48.874 --> 17:52.325
He's gonna make a tuxedo
out of our puppies.

17:53.837 --> 17:56.708
- Bart.
- Sorry. You gotta admit, it's catchy.

17:56.882 --> 18:00.381
Come on, Smithers. Let's go
finish the little flea circuses off.

18:00.552 --> 18:04.870
Except for little Monty, of course.

18:05.224 --> 18:08.110
We gotta get the dogs out of there.

18:12.106 --> 18:14.857
- Hush, puppies.
- We gotta get you out of here.

18:22.320 --> 18:23.906
I know. The window.

18:24.410 --> 18:27.280
- No. What are you doing?
- Dogs always land on their feet.

18:27.454 --> 18:30.280
- That's cats.
- No, it's dogs. I'll prove it.

18:32.710 --> 18:34.370
Best two out of three.

18:37.131 --> 18:40.100
Bart, look. A laundry chute.

18:40.175 --> 18:42.417
Okay, guys. Let's move.

18:49.393 --> 18:51.849
Come on, come on.

18:52.146 --> 18:54.352
I've got an idea.

19:03.866 --> 19:08.160
Sorry, Monty,
but you're too big for this ride.

19:14.543 --> 19:16.666
- Quick, let's get the...
- Going somewhere?

19:16.837 --> 19:19.838
That's impossible.
How did you get here first?

19:20.700 --> 19:22.628
Oh, there'll be plenty of time
for explanations later.

19:22.801 --> 19:24.344
Right now, I'll be taking
my puppies back.

19:26.513 --> 19:28.138
But they're ours.
You stole them from us.

19:28.307 --> 19:31.474
Here's a phone.
Call somebody who cares.

19:32.227 --> 19:34.932
Give me that.
Now, if you'll excuse us, children...

19:35.356 --> 19:37.977
...the pups have a date
with a fashion knife.

19:39.568 --> 19:43.151
There. Now you don't know
which one's little Monty.

19:43.322 --> 19:47.865
If you don't want him to be part of your
tuxedo, you'll let the other dogs go too.

19:48.350 --> 19:51.902
Nice try.
Come on, little Monty. Stand up.

19:53.820 --> 19:55.407
Come on, stand up. Do your trick.

19:55.584 --> 19:57.292
No. Don't. Stay down, Monty.

19:57.461 --> 20:01.210
- Stay down. Stay down, boy.
- No. Don't get up. Good boy.

20:01.632 --> 20:02.960
Excellent.

20:09.890 --> 20:14.386
Now it's simply a matter
of bending down...

20:14.561 --> 20:17.266
...and picking up the one and only...

20:19.650 --> 20:22.355
This can't be happening.
They're all standing.

20:22.528 --> 20:24.983
I can't tell them apart.

20:25.948 --> 20:28.106
All right, you win.

20:28.283 --> 20:30.739
- I'll have to kill them all.
- No!

20:32.997 --> 20:35.452
But they're so wretchedly adorable.

20:35.624 --> 20:38.910
Twenty-five little Rory Calhouns.

20:39.860 --> 20:40.580
I can't do it.

20:40.754 --> 20:42.498
But I can kill you.

20:44.258 --> 20:47.128
No, I can't kill you either.

20:47.302 --> 20:51.300
Look at you, standing there
on your hind legs...

20:51.473 --> 20:54.110
...like a couple of Rory Calhouns.

20:56.145 --> 21:00.474
Mr. Burns, I hope you've realized the folly
of killing innocent animals for fashion.

21:00.649 --> 21:05.774
I have, I have. I swear, I'll never wear
any clothing made from an animal...

21:05.946 --> 21:08.152
...that can do an amusing trick.

21:08.699 --> 21:11.735
Another victory for Montgomery Burns '
champion greyhounds.

21:11.910 --> 21:14.690
Twenty-five dogs,
25 world champions...

21:14.246 --> 21:17.810
...which so far have earned
their owner over $ 10 million.

21:17.249 --> 21:20.452
I'll bet whoever gave him those dogs
is kicking themselves now.

21:23.505 --> 21:25.961
Homer! For the love of God, no!

21:28.260 --> 21:31.510
Marge, you know that batting
this light bulb is the only thing...

21:31.680 --> 21:35.844
...that cheers me up after giving away
those million-dollar greyhounds.
