WEBVTT

00:01.202 --> 00:04.004
(Will)
There it is!

00:04.105 --> 00:05.373
We're officially
in Connecticut.

00:05.473 --> 00:07.641
Where the whites keep down
the other whites.

00:10.278 --> 00:14.148
I'm starting to dread
Christmas at the Trumans.

00:14.248 --> 00:15.516
Every time someone says
Merry Christmas,

00:15.616 --> 00:18.086
your mother looks at me
with pity and says,

00:18.186 --> 00:20.188
"And Hanukkah."

00:21.822 --> 00:23.724
But, honey,
won't it be fun for you?

00:23.824 --> 00:26.794
Maybe you can bang
Will's brother again.

00:28.162 --> 00:29.130
Maybe?

00:29.230 --> 00:30.331
Sam's divorce
just became final.

00:30.431 --> 00:32.766
There's no way this one's
gonna keep it in her pants.

00:35.169 --> 00:38.172
What is this "it"
you speak of in her pants?

00:39.273 --> 00:40.774
No, no, no.
I don't wanna know.

00:40.874 --> 00:41.642
Like that show Lost.

00:41.742 --> 00:43.344
Once you find out
what's in the hatch,

00:43.444 --> 00:46.114
it's less interesting.

00:46.214 --> 00:48.182
You don't have to worry about me
hooking up with Sam.

00:48.282 --> 00:51.485
All that stuff between us
is ancient history.

00:51.585 --> 00:53.387
Oh, isn't that nice?

00:53.487 --> 00:56.457
The Holiday Whore
is taking a year off.

01:02.663 --> 01:04.365
Hey, Kar, why aren't you
with Stan, anyway?

01:04.465 --> 01:07.535
Oh, he's taking Mason
and Olivia to Thailand.

01:07.635 --> 01:11.139
He loves going there because
of the white sand beaches.

01:11.239 --> 01:13.507
And they think
he's the Buddha.

01:14.708 --> 01:17.278
Oh, I can't wait to meet
your gay nephew.

01:17.378 --> 01:19.547
You guys think
everyone is gay.

01:19.647 --> 01:21.349
Jordy's only nine.

01:21.449 --> 01:25.319
It's no big deal that he went
as Wonder Woman on Halloween.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.221
He didn't go
as Wonder Woman, Grace.

01:27.321 --> 01:30.424
He went as Lynda Carter.

01:34.195 --> 01:37.231
I once went
as Lynda Carter.

01:37.331 --> 01:39.233
But from the Maybelline
commercial.

01:39.333 --> 01:41.435
Yeah.

01:41.535 --> 01:44.438
That stuff
really works.

01:44.538 --> 01:47.208
Kids made fun of me all night.
I cried and cried.

01:47.308 --> 01:49.143
My mascara never ran.

02:01.922 --> 02:04.658
Mom...we're here!

02:04.758 --> 02:06.194
Merry Christmas.

02:06.294 --> 02:07.295
Mwah!
Mwah!

02:07.395 --> 02:09.430
And Hanukkah.

02:11.232 --> 02:13.367
Now, Grace,
don't feel awkward.

02:13.467 --> 02:16.237
You are always welcome here--
even at Christmas.

02:17.671 --> 02:19.373
Marilyn,
I don't feel awkward.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.275
Just like
I'd hope you wouldn't

02:21.375 --> 02:23.177
if you came to my home
on Hanukkah.

02:23.277 --> 02:25.246
Thank you, dear.

02:25.346 --> 02:26.880
We'll cross that bridge
when we get to it.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.683
Now, who needs a drink?

02:29.783 --> 02:31.552
I didn't come here
for the company.

02:33.787 --> 02:35.689
(Jack)
Hey, Will, your brother
just got here.

02:35.789 --> 02:37.458
Oh, and look
what he's got with him.

02:37.558 --> 02:39.159
A little Christmas queer.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.500
Just...can it
with the queer stuff

02:46.600 --> 02:47.801
in front of my mom.

02:47.901 --> 02:49.503
I don't think
she can handle

02:49.603 --> 02:51.239
having another gay kid
in the family.

02:51.339 --> 02:52.540
I remember one Christmas,

02:52.640 --> 02:54.508
she was so excited
when I asked for two G.I. Joes,

02:54.608 --> 02:56.277
'cause she thought
I was building an army.

02:58.446 --> 03:01.715
She freaked when she realized
I was really building a home.

03:05.486 --> 03:08.489
Guys, really.
We don't even know if he's gay.

03:09.723 --> 03:11.959
Hi, Uncle Will!
Hey!

03:12.059 --> 03:14.762
Guess what!
I invented a new cologne.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.530
It's called Scoundrel.

03:16.630 --> 03:17.898
And we know.

03:20.634 --> 03:23.937
Uh, Scoundrel
is Joan Collins' fragrance.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.339
Darn it!

03:25.439 --> 03:27.908
That woman is always
a step ahead of me.

03:29.743 --> 03:31.779
Oh, Jordy, I am so glad
you're here.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.281
Now you can help me
fold napkins.

03:33.381 --> 03:34.315
Sure.

03:34.415 --> 03:37.651
I...love him.

03:39.953 --> 03:41.555
Hey!

03:41.655 --> 03:42.756
Come on, come on.

03:42.856 --> 03:46.260
Sammy. And it's
my favorite niece....

03:46.360 --> 03:47.828
Casey!

03:47.928 --> 03:50.698
She's adopted, but I like her
as if she were real.

03:53.601 --> 03:55.002
Hey, look who's here.

03:55.102 --> 03:56.437
Hi, Grandma.

03:56.537 --> 03:58.005
Oh, sweetheart.

03:58.105 --> 04:00.841
You know, I think she should
call me Marilyn.

04:00.941 --> 04:04.312
Her real grandmothers
in China might get upset.

04:04.412 --> 04:06.013
Uh, mom, you are
her real grandmother,

04:06.113 --> 04:07.815
and, uh, thank you
for hugging her

04:07.915 --> 04:10.718
instead of bowing to her
like you did on Thanksgiving.

04:12.353 --> 04:14.254
Hey, how about we get you
some apple juice?

04:14.355 --> 04:16.890
And you can drink it from
a Wedgwood champagne float.

04:16.990 --> 04:19.026
Grandma loves that.

04:22.530 --> 04:24.031
Hi, Sam.
Hey, Grace, hey.

04:24.131 --> 04:25.999
It's great to see you.
You too.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.701
Oop, sorry.
Hey.

04:27.801 --> 04:29.637
Ha--

04:29.737 --> 04:30.838
Hi.
Hi.

04:30.938 --> 04:33.006
So, uh, how
was the ride up?

04:33.106 --> 04:34.575
Long.

04:35.743 --> 04:37.010
Jordy made me sing along
to the Rent soundtrack.

04:37.110 --> 04:42.583
So...it felt like
525,600 miles.

04:45.386 --> 04:47.355
Oh, Jordy's sweet.
You know, he's just--

04:47.455 --> 04:49.990
You know, excuse me.
I just gotta go get a ladder.

04:50.090 --> 04:51.392
There's a couple bulbs
out in front.

04:51.492 --> 04:54.862
And now it just says,
"Happy Ho days."

04:54.962 --> 04:57.331
Guess it 'tis the season.

04:57.431 --> 05:00.334
What with all the eggnog--
Uh-huh, excuse me.

05:00.434 --> 05:03.804
Yeah, I guess you're
going in there to laugh.

05:05.639 --> 05:09.377
Don't you think the tree
is T-acky?

05:11.812 --> 05:14.348
She should have gone
monochromatic.

05:14.448 --> 05:16.817
E-X-actly.

05:18.051 --> 05:21.455
Yeah, you wanna pick
your spots with that.

05:23.023 --> 05:25.426
Jack, I wanna put on
a Christmas show tonight.

05:25.526 --> 05:26.460
Will you help me?

05:26.560 --> 05:30.398
I'd be D-E-lighted.

05:31.965 --> 05:34.502
See, now, that's
where that works.

05:36.604 --> 05:38.872
Hey, Karen, would you keep
an eye on Casey for a minute?

05:38.972 --> 05:40.874
I wanna run upstairs
and get her my G.I. Joes,

05:40.974 --> 05:43.377
their gardening tools,
and their bed and breakfast.

05:43.477 --> 05:46.046
Well, of course I will.

05:46.146 --> 05:49.617
She's so cute,
I could just eat her up.

05:49.717 --> 05:50.884
Yeah.

05:52.119 --> 05:54.121
You won't,
though, right?

05:57.057 --> 05:58.426
Hello, little girl.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.529
Oh, what's that?

06:01.629 --> 06:03.397
It's a diamond ring.

06:03.497 --> 06:06.567
Hmm...not a very good one.

06:08.936 --> 06:10.704
It's occluded...

06:10.804 --> 06:13.941
the cut is pedestrian,
and...

06:16.009 --> 06:17.811
It's watermelon.

06:19.580 --> 06:24.117
Here...see what a real
diamond looks like.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.086
Mm-hmm.
It's from my husband.

06:26.186 --> 06:27.455
[chuckles]

06:27.555 --> 06:29.022
And believe me,
you're getting it

06:29.122 --> 06:31.391
a lot easier than I did.

06:34.828 --> 06:36.797
Hey, Jordy, I was just
on the phone

06:36.897 --> 06:38.466
with your
Grandpa George.

06:38.566 --> 06:40.100
He wishes he was here,
but he's with his girlfr--

06:40.200 --> 06:42.470
He's helping Santa.

06:42.570 --> 06:45.138
Hey, Will, help us
with Jordy's Christmas show.

06:45.238 --> 06:46.474
A Christmas show?

06:46.574 --> 06:47.641
No, no, no.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.577
No, Jordy,
that's a bad idea.

06:49.677 --> 06:52.446
Grandma doesn't really
like Christmas shows.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.815
Really? But I've been
planning it for months.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.416
I know, and I'm--
I'm sorry.

06:56.517 --> 06:57.851
But it's just--
It makes her uncomfortable.

06:57.951 --> 07:00.621
She's rather see little boys
playing in the snow than--

07:00.721 --> 07:02.723
than singin' in the rain.

07:05.493 --> 07:07.194
Jordy, take five.

07:07.294 --> 07:08.762
Have a smoke
and a carrot stick.

07:08.862 --> 07:10.564
Your aunts need
to talk shop.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.835
What's going on here?

07:14.935 --> 07:17.037
I don't remember driving
into the town from Footloose.

07:17.137 --> 07:18.872
Let the boy dance!

07:20.708 --> 07:22.510
I know my mother.

07:22.610 --> 07:25.879
You have no idea how many
of my little plays she ruined.

07:25.979 --> 07:27.481
Talking and fidgeting

07:27.581 --> 07:29.449
and doing anything
to distract the family

07:29.550 --> 07:33.220
from watching her gay son do
fan kicks in the beanbag chair!

07:33.320 --> 07:36.189
Oh, you poor thing.

07:37.190 --> 07:39.092
Ow!

07:39.192 --> 07:40.594
Let the boy dance!

07:41.695 --> 07:44.197
I just don't want to see
Jordy humiliated like I was.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.899
I used to be so upset,

07:45.999 --> 07:47.701
I'd spend the rest of the night
scarfing down butter cookies

07:47.801 --> 07:49.169
and pretending that
the crinkling of the wrappers

07:49.269 --> 07:51.705
was...applause.

07:53.574 --> 07:56.209
I-I had no idea.

07:57.277 --> 07:59.513
Oww!
Let the boy dance!

07:59.613 --> 08:01.148
Oh, Karen,

08:01.248 --> 08:03.150
try my famous
holiday cocktail,

08:03.250 --> 08:04.752
the Blue Marilyn.

08:05.953 --> 08:08.255
I started drinking them
to prevent thoughts of suicide.

08:08.355 --> 08:09.723
But now they're just fun.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.163
Oh, delicious.

08:16.263 --> 08:17.164
What's in it?

08:17.264 --> 08:18.666
[chuckles]

08:18.766 --> 08:21.001
Uh-uh, family secret.
Can't tell you.

08:21.101 --> 08:25.238
I bet I can guess.

08:25.338 --> 08:26.707
Blue Carousel...

08:26.807 --> 08:28.008
vodka...

08:28.108 --> 08:30.778
a splash of peach schnapps
and bitters,

08:30.878 --> 08:32.880
and a pinch
of something powdered.

08:32.980 --> 08:36.516
Oh, sugar.

08:36.617 --> 08:38.686
Perfect,
you guessed them all.

08:38.786 --> 08:39.887
Ha ha, I knew it!

08:39.987 --> 08:41.889
Except one.

08:43.724 --> 08:45.559
Has anyone seen Sam?

08:45.659 --> 08:47.227
Did you check
down your pants?

08:50.731 --> 08:52.566
Oh, I sent him
up to the attic

08:52.666 --> 08:54.234
to find the menorah
for you, Grace.

08:54.334 --> 08:56.604
We still have one
from when

08:56.704 --> 08:57.971
our Jewish neighbors
came over.

08:58.071 --> 09:00.273
Yeah, oh, it's a shame
they had to move.

09:00.373 --> 09:01.909
Oh, well.

09:02.009 --> 09:05.145
The neighborhood association
is very strong.

09:08.215 --> 09:09.717
So what's going on?

09:09.817 --> 09:12.285
Things with you and Sam
heating up again?

09:12.385 --> 09:14.021
Is that a tear-away tux?

09:15.989 --> 09:17.257
Hardly.

09:17.357 --> 09:19.760
I tried to talk to him,
and he cut me off.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.261
And every time
I walk into a room,

09:21.361 --> 09:23.631
he finds a reason
to leave.

09:23.731 --> 09:25.899
God, I hate it
when people are rude.

09:38.311 --> 09:40.147
Will, come here.
I wanna show you something.

09:40.247 --> 09:41.281
Yeah, I saw it.

09:41.381 --> 09:42.816
You put the wise men
in a three-way.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.652
Now...

09:44.752 --> 09:46.887
Put it back before my mom
looks outside.

09:46.987 --> 09:48.989
No...that.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.324
(Will)
Oh, my God.

09:51.424 --> 09:54.728
He's stuffing himself
with butter cookies.

09:54.828 --> 09:58.866
Well, it's your work.
Why don't you go sign it?

09:58.966 --> 10:00.968
It's like
looking at myself

10:01.068 --> 10:02.636
30 years ago.

10:02.736 --> 10:05.673
Only without
the Mork & Min suspenders.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.642
Jordy?

10:08.742 --> 10:11.645
Hi, Uncle Will.

10:13.013 --> 10:15.683
Spit out those empty calories
and put on your tap shoes.

10:15.783 --> 10:17.685
I don't care what grandma says.
We're puttin' on a show!

10:17.785 --> 10:19.987
Really?
Yes, really!

10:20.087 --> 10:21.655
Now go
run around the yard!

10:21.755 --> 10:25.192
I want you five pounds lighter
for the opening number!

10:27.394 --> 10:28.862
Wow.

10:28.962 --> 10:32.733
This is the most organized
attic I've ever been in.

10:32.833 --> 10:35.302
"Gifts from the housekeeper."

10:35.402 --> 10:37.404
"Gifts from the gardener."

10:37.504 --> 10:38.906
Oh, sad.

10:39.006 --> 10:41.008
"Gifts from Grace"?!

10:41.108 --> 10:43.376
Yeah, my mother was never good
at accepting gifts.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.979
When I was in the fourth grade,
I made her an ashtray.

10:46.079 --> 10:49.116
She said, "Great, now
I've gotta get you something."

10:50.417 --> 10:53.854
Well, uh, the menorah isn't
where she said it was.

10:53.954 --> 10:55.255
So I guess I'll be
getting downstairs now.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.925
Sam, no, come on.

10:58.025 --> 10:58.992
You've been dodging me
all night.

10:59.092 --> 10:59.993
What's going on?
Nothin'.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.328
I just, uh...

11:01.428 --> 11:02.830
I just don't wanna
talk to you.

11:02.930 --> 11:05.165
Oh, that--that
makes me feel better.

11:05.265 --> 11:07.300
I'm sorry, you're right.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.703
That--that didn't
come out right, uh...

11:09.803 --> 11:12.372
Grace, it's just that, um,

11:12.472 --> 11:16.443
I'm afraid
if I'm alone with you,

11:16.543 --> 11:18.411
something might happen.

11:22.215 --> 11:23.751
I'm less offended.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.121
Keep going.

11:28.221 --> 11:30.223
Not that I'm assuming
you'd even want it to.

11:30.323 --> 11:31.391
Oh, I don't.

11:31.491 --> 11:33.326
I mean,
even on the ride up here,

11:33.426 --> 11:36.696
I-I announced that,
you know,

11:36.797 --> 11:38.431
I don't want anything
to happen with you.

11:38.531 --> 11:39.767
Oh, super!

11:39.867 --> 11:42.002
I'm glad that
my lack of desirability

11:42.102 --> 11:44.772
deserves an announcement.

11:44.872 --> 11:47.775
No, that's not what I mean.

11:47.875 --> 11:50.744
I agree with you that,
you know, nothing should happen.

11:50.844 --> 11:51.611
I was--

11:51.711 --> 11:53.280
I was worried
you didn't like me.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.048
Oh, God, no.

11:55.148 --> 11:57.484
Grace, I, uh...I do.

11:57.584 --> 11:58.485
I do like you.

11:58.585 --> 12:00.487
Well...good,

12:00.587 --> 12:02.222
'cause I like you too.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.424
That's good.

12:04.524 --> 12:06.026
So we're agreed.

12:06.126 --> 12:08.929
We like each other...

12:09.029 --> 12:10.463
and nothing's gonna happen.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.100
Agreed.

12:14.467 --> 12:16.169
You look hot.
Agreed.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.209
Oh, God.

12:22.309 --> 12:26.379
That's the only time a menorah
got me to first base.

12:26.479 --> 12:27.981
Not me.

12:36.156 --> 12:37.858
All right,
there's not enough of us

12:37.958 --> 12:40.894
to do A Partridge Family
in a Pear Tree.

12:42.963 --> 12:46.066
How about this:
you pop out of the fireplace

12:46.166 --> 12:47.234
with a mask on.

12:47.334 --> 12:49.502
You're
the Phantom of the Chimney.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.504
Ooh, I like that.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.340
And, Jordy, we can make an opera
cape out of...

12:53.440 --> 12:56.509
well, your opera cape.

12:56.609 --> 12:59.446
I should steam the wrinkles
out of that.

12:59.546 --> 13:00.814
I wore it to bed last night.

13:03.016 --> 13:04.517
So sad.

13:04.617 --> 13:07.387
A boy his age should be
sleeping in a kimono.

13:11.491 --> 13:13.226
Did you warn
your mother yet?

13:13.326 --> 13:14.895
No, no, no.
It's better we spring it on her.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.296
The more time she has
to think about it,

13:16.396 --> 13:17.197
the more time she has
to ruin it.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.432
Just like she ruined
my 1975 Easter show,

13:19.532 --> 13:21.801
Everything's Coming Up Jesus.

13:23.303 --> 13:28.108
Is the secret ingredient
anything in the blood family?

13:28.208 --> 13:30.277
I don't know how I can
make this any clearer.

13:30.377 --> 13:34.147
There are no bodily fluids
in a Blue Marilyn.

13:35.248 --> 13:36.516
Now, please, just give up,

13:36.616 --> 13:37.951
'cause you're never
gonna get it.

13:38.051 --> 13:39.019
Oh, I will.

13:39.887 --> 13:42.289
I will discover
your secret ingredient!

13:42.389 --> 13:44.992
Even if it is the rarest,
most exotic essence

13:45.092 --> 13:48.428
found on the planet!

13:48.528 --> 13:50.530
Is it milk?

13:52.165 --> 13:53.266
No.

13:54.301 --> 13:57.470
Oh, Sam, did you find
that menorah for Grace?

13:57.570 --> 13:59.506
Uh, no,
I couldn't find it,

13:59.606 --> 14:01.374
but we looked for it
a very long time.

14:01.474 --> 14:02.542
Oh.

14:02.642 --> 14:04.277
Well, did you check
in the drawers?

14:04.377 --> 14:07.380
Uh, we didn't have time.
Maybe later.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.382
Did you look
in that little chest?

14:09.482 --> 14:11.551
Do not answer that.

14:14.054 --> 14:17.490
Well, let's look again,
because I know it's up there.

14:17.590 --> 14:21.094
I used it last August to hold
the bug repellent candles.

14:21.194 --> 14:23.196
Yeah, yeah.

14:23.296 --> 14:24.998
I remember,
'cause it stopped

14:25.098 --> 14:25.899
the Jewish mosquitoes
from biting.

14:25.999 --> 14:29.102
Instead, they just
had a little nosh.

14:30.637 --> 14:32.272
Well...

14:32.372 --> 14:33.606
The tousled hair.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.075
The slightly
smeared lipstick.

14:35.175 --> 14:37.277
The disheveled clothing.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.112
Either you're
on your way to work...

14:39.212 --> 14:41.548
or the Holiday Whore
is back!

14:45.518 --> 14:49.056
Sam and I made out in the attic.
It was so hot!

14:49.156 --> 14:50.890
I know I said
I wasn't gonna do it, but...

14:50.991 --> 14:52.592
I've liked him
for a long time.

14:52.692 --> 14:55.895
And...he's single now.

14:55.996 --> 14:57.530
Or is this just too weird?

14:57.630 --> 14:59.532
Honey...

14:59.632 --> 15:02.069
For your entire life,

15:02.169 --> 15:04.171
fate has been cruel to you

15:04.271 --> 15:06.606
in almost every way.

15:08.341 --> 15:11.044
So...maybe this time,

15:11.144 --> 15:13.646
fate stepped back,
took a good look at you,

15:13.746 --> 15:15.615
and said, "You know what?
Enough already."

15:15.715 --> 15:17.617
Hmm?

15:17.717 --> 15:19.352
I say go for it.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.288
You know what?
I will.

15:21.388 --> 15:23.490
For all the good I do...

15:23.590 --> 15:27.027
I deserve something good
to happen to me.

15:28.661 --> 15:30.630
What is wrong
with these things?

15:35.668 --> 15:41.208
I don't know where
you get your jewelry, but...

15:41.308 --> 15:46.980
this necklace
is delicious.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.181
Don't start without me.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.583
Mom, what are you doing?

15:50.683 --> 15:52.652
Getting ready
to enjoy the show.

15:52.752 --> 15:54.721
[hissing]
What's your game, woman?

15:57.524 --> 15:58.625
And now,
ladies and gentlemen,

15:58.725 --> 16:00.960
introducing Jordy St. James!

16:01.061 --> 16:02.395
[gasps]

16:02.495 --> 16:04.064
That's his stage name.

16:04.164 --> 16:05.698
I had to nix
Dame Jordy Dench.

16:05.798 --> 16:08.068
[Jack playing Mr. Cellophane]

16:08.168 --> 16:11.238
* Santa Claus,
Mr. Santa Claus *

16:11.338 --> 16:12.705
* I get the kids' applause

16:12.805 --> 16:14.641
* Mr. Santa Claus

16:14.741 --> 16:18.511
That boy is the next
Wayne Newton.

16:18.611 --> 16:21.248
How many Blue Marilyns
have you had?

16:21.348 --> 16:22.249
Will, shoosh.

16:22.349 --> 16:23.316
You shoosh!

16:23.416 --> 16:25.285
Will, you shoosh!

16:25.385 --> 16:27.287
Will you shoosh?!

16:28.355 --> 16:30.357
This is Jordy's moment!

16:30.457 --> 16:31.758
And keyboard solo.

16:31.858 --> 16:33.626
Jordy, you're in the audience
for this, sweetheart.

16:33.726 --> 16:36.596
*

16:36.696 --> 16:37.730
[high note]

16:37.830 --> 16:40.633
*

16:40.733 --> 16:42.702
* All

16:42.802 --> 16:45.738
* That

16:45.838 --> 16:50.177
* Claus

16:50.277 --> 16:52.445
[whispering]
That Claus.

16:55.548 --> 16:57.517
Bravo!
Bravo!

16:57.617 --> 16:59.052
Okay, that is it!

16:59.152 --> 17:01.621
How dare you enjoy
your grandson's Christmas show

17:01.721 --> 17:03.556
right in front of me?

17:03.656 --> 17:05.625
Well, William,
what is your problem?

17:05.725 --> 17:06.759
I don't know.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.628
Maybe it's that you ruined

17:08.728 --> 17:10.263
every single
Christmas play I ever did!

17:10.363 --> 17:11.431
I-I mean,

17:11.531 --> 17:12.599
you give him
a standing ovation,

17:12.699 --> 17:14.401
but for me you'd be
fidgeting,

17:14.501 --> 17:15.768
looking at your watch.

17:16.936 --> 17:19.439
melting a cherry Sucret into
your stupid secret drink.

17:19.539 --> 17:20.773
Ah, aha!

17:29.349 --> 17:31.284
Unbelievable!

17:31.384 --> 17:33.286
Will just had
to steal the spotlight.

17:33.386 --> 17:34.687
That's okay, Jack,
I don't mind.

17:34.787 --> 17:37.824
[crying]
He stole if from me, Jordy.
Grow up.

17:40.627 --> 17:42.262
(Marilyn)
Oh, Will.

17:42.362 --> 17:44.497
I don't get it.

17:44.597 --> 17:46.799
How could you be
so encouraging to Jordy

17:46.899 --> 17:49.636
when you were always
so awful to me?

17:49.736 --> 17:51.604
Oh, darling, I think...

17:51.704 --> 17:54.707
When you were a child,
I think I...

17:54.807 --> 17:56.809
I just handled
everything badly.

17:56.909 --> 18:00.780
You know, I wasn't prepared
to raise a gay son.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.215
You know, it was '50s--

18:02.315 --> 18:04.817
It was not the '50s!

18:04.917 --> 18:07.120
Oh, yeah.
Well...

18:09.922 --> 18:12.659
Darling,
because of who you are

18:12.759 --> 18:14.161
and what you've become,

18:14.261 --> 18:17.497
I realize that I...

18:17.597 --> 18:20.600
I just should have
done things differently.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.569
I learned from you, Will.

18:22.669 --> 18:24.871
You did?
Yeah.

18:24.971 --> 18:27.274
And even though
I can't change the past,

18:27.374 --> 18:31.844
I can try to be better
with Jordy, you know?

18:31.944 --> 18:35.382
Wow.
Thank you, Mom.

18:35.482 --> 18:37.350
That means a lot to me.

18:37.450 --> 18:38.818
Ohh.

18:40.520 --> 18:41.588
Wow.

18:41.688 --> 18:42.855
When did you do all this?

18:42.955 --> 18:44.123
Ah, before the show.

18:44.224 --> 18:45.325
During the encores,

18:46.326 --> 18:47.460
I was worried that the house
was gonna burn down.

18:47.560 --> 18:50.830
I-I can see why.

18:50.930 --> 18:55.435
Five of the candles are on
a box marked "dry hay."

18:57.704 --> 18:59.606
Sam, this is so...

18:59.706 --> 19:00.807
Romantic?
Wonderful?

19:02.242 --> 19:03.876
Excessive?

19:03.976 --> 19:05.712
It's, uh...

19:05.812 --> 19:07.780
It's excessive, isn't it?

19:07.880 --> 19:08.815
It's a lot.

19:08.915 --> 19:10.850
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

19:10.950 --> 19:13.786
I just--I was so worried
about that.

19:13.886 --> 19:15.755
God, I guess
I just can't remember

19:15.855 --> 19:17.190
what it's like to be
in the beginning

19:17.290 --> 19:18.625
of a relationship,
you know?

19:18.725 --> 19:20.393
Just thought it'd be
a lot easier

19:20.493 --> 19:22.295
jumping right
into the middle of one.

19:22.395 --> 19:24.864
I know, it does.

19:26.866 --> 19:30.837
Right after
Leo and I split up...

19:30.937 --> 19:32.772
[crunch]

19:36.943 --> 19:38.411
Um...

19:39.712 --> 19:42.882
After Leo and I,

19:42.982 --> 19:45.585
every guy who opened
the door for me

19:45.685 --> 19:47.354
got my house key.

19:47.454 --> 19:48.755
I spent a lot of money

19:48.855 --> 19:51.758
changing locks that year.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.626
And it was because I was

19:53.726 --> 19:57.397
just so afraid
of being single.

19:57.497 --> 19:59.699
And I think you
might be too.

19:59.799 --> 20:02.602
Well, I'm not afraid.

20:02.702 --> 20:05.938
I'm, uh...I'm terrified.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.341
And I think you need to be.

20:08.441 --> 20:09.876
Terrified or single?

20:09.976 --> 20:11.511
Both.
Ah.

20:11.611 --> 20:12.812
Fun!

20:15.782 --> 20:17.550
You'll make it.

20:17.650 --> 20:18.851
I did.

20:21.854 --> 20:23.856
Okay.

20:23.956 --> 20:26.259
So how about this...

20:26.359 --> 20:29.429
Next Christmas,
you and me, right here.

20:30.597 --> 20:33.266
And we see
where we are then.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.736
That sounds great.

20:37.870 --> 20:39.439
Is it incredibly hot in here?

20:39.539 --> 20:41.641
Like 1,000 degrees.

20:44.644 --> 20:46.746
Hey, Jordy,
I just got off the phone.

20:46.846 --> 20:49.816
How would you like to perform
our show next Christmas

20:49.916 --> 20:51.684
at Radio City Music Hall?

20:51.784 --> 20:53.820
I'd love it!
It would be fantastic!

20:53.920 --> 20:57.023
Good, then you try calling them.
They keep hanging up on me.

20:57.123 --> 20:59.392
Marilyn...

20:59.492 --> 21:00.627
thank you.

21:00.727 --> 21:01.694
Dinner was wonderful,

21:01.794 --> 21:03.396
I have a delightful buzz,

21:03.496 --> 21:05.998
and my sore throat
went away.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.835
By the way, I put something
in your coffee.

21:08.935 --> 21:11.471
Tell me when you figure out
what it is.
