05:30.898 --> 05:32.633
I'm guessing no cable.

05:32.633 --> 05:33.801
Nor wifi.

05:33.801 --> 05:36.103
How do you survive without a
phone?

some in some areas out back.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.646
And how old is this house?

05:45.646 --> 05:47.781
It was built in the late 1800's.

05:48.015 --> 05:51.284
My great-great-grandfather
Jasper Bischer built it.

05:51.284 --> 05:53.821
It's been handed down from
generation to generation.

05:53.821 --> 05:55.589
Definitely smells like it.

05:55.989 --> 05:57.991
[woman]
So you live here by yourself?

05:57.991 --> 06:00.360
No, far too big to live in by
myself.

Niko lives here and my Gammi.

06:03.130 --> 06:03.797

Ethan is that ok?

Didn't think it was importan.

I always made sure
the crew ate right.

10:58.926 --> 11:01.428

feed them.

11:01.428 --> 11:02.429

11:03.063 --> 11:05.833
Another tradition I like to keep
going is roll call.

11:05.833 --> 11:06.900
What's that?

11:06.900 --> 11:09.837
That's where you stand up,
make an introductions

11:09.837 --> 11:12.740
and tell everybody
a little about yourself.

11:12.740 --> 11:13.841
I'll go first.

My name is Sean Bischer anm
an alcoholic.

11:21.348 --> 11:22.916
I'll drink to that.

11:23.283 --> 11:25.318
But seriously though,
I'm a third

11:25.318 --> 11:27.287
generation horror enthusiast.

11:27.287 --> 11:29.589
Gammie introduced me to bloo,
guts

11:29.589 --> 11:31.925
and gore at the
tender age of three.

11:31.925 --> 11:33.693
At 14 I made my first film.

11:34.627 --> 11:38.331
A little 5 minute short aba
neighborhood haunted house.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.201
Let's just say I'm glad I got my

11:41.201 --> 11:43.303
really bad work
out of the way early.

11:44.504 --> 11:46.774
I've been in the business 30
years

11:47.474 --> 11:48.608
and I love it.

11:49.309 --> 11:52.946
There's truly nothing else I
would rather do with my life.

11:54.014 --> 11:56.116
I don't know where I'd be
without it.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.385

13:05.385 --> 13:08.755
I was surprised that

I'll admit this is my first
feature but...

13:38.085 --> 13:40.420
I was built for this, I've gt
this.

13:42.923 --> 13:45.225
I can't wait until we
actually start shooting

13:45.225 --> 13:47.494
because that's when
I'm at my absolute best.

13:47.928 --> 13:48.929
Hands down.

14:01.008 --> 14:02.142

14:10.783 --> 14:12.085
That's about it.

14:14.587 --> 14:17.357
Come on Ethan, you can do better

Ethan made a name

14:32.772 --> 14:35.275
very first film at the
tender age of 20.

14:35.508 --> 14:36.843
Johnny's room.

14:36.843 --> 14:39.779
Which made him a highly sougt
after director.

14:39.779 --> 14:42.983
He followed it up again with his
next film which was even better.

14:42.983 --> 14:44.551
[low ominous music]

14:44.551 --> 14:48.121
By the tender age of 22 Ethan
was Mr. Fucking Hollywood.

14:49.689 --> 14:51.558
Until he pissed it all away.

14:51.558 --> 14:54.527
Right, Ethan?

14:59.632 --> 15:01.634
Your water's better than min.

You're probably wondering,t
have I got myself into?

17:22.475 --> 17:24.144
That had crossed my mind.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.949
You've got a bunch
of college kids...

17:29.949 --> 17:32.452
inexperienced
college kids at that,

17:32.785 --> 17:37.124
working on what's supposed to be
the best horror film ever;

17:38.291 --> 17:40.493
and where's the rest of your
crew?

17:42.028 --> 17:43.830
I tried making this picture with

17:43.830 --> 17:45.898
union guys,
it wouldn't come together.

17:47.467 --> 17:50.002
So I figured, why not try h
talent?

17:50.970 --> 17:54.307
As for the rest of the crew,
they're gonna be here soon.

17:54.307 --> 17:56.743
I brought a handful of you ot
here early.

17:56.743 --> 17:59.846
So you could all get to knw
each other a little bit be.

17:59.846 --> 18:02.549
It's really necessary
if I'm gonna pull off...

18:03.216 --> 18:04.717
what I'm trying to pull off.

18:06.052 --> 18:08.388
And what are you trying tol
off?

18:09.189 --> 18:13.260
Like I said... make the be.
horror film... ever.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.700
We're not that
different you and I.

18:23.203 --> 18:24.871
How do you figure that?

18:26.206 --> 18:28.908
We both tasted the success of
Hollywood.

18:28.908 --> 18:31.444
We know what it's like to be
elevated.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.680
Bolstered around
like kings before

18:33.680 --> 18:35.882
being spit out and
being forgotten.

18:36.383 --> 18:39.852
Left to rot like road-kill on
the side of the street

18:39.852 --> 18:41.921
but we didn't let that sto.

18:43.190 --> 18:45.192
Despite public opinion we roe

18:45.192 --> 18:47.194
from the ashes
and voyaged forth.

18:48.528 --> 18:49.762
We're survivors.

18:54.301 --> 18:56.569
What if I told you
this film was our

18:56.569 --> 18:59.105
chance to get back
to that grand stage?

19:00.106 --> 19:03.476
What if I told you the glam, the
lights, the attention...

19:05.212 --> 19:06.879
you can have it all back.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.149
What would you do for it?

19:14.254 --> 19:15.788
Excuse me, I gotta take this.

19:15.788 --> 19:16.756
Alright.

19:19.326 --> 19:20.327
Hello?

19:34.774 --> 19:38.278
I think we found him, GammI
think we found our star.

19:40.480 --> 19:41.481
[chuckling]

19:43.416 --> 19:44.817
[mellow music in background]

19:44.817 --> 19:46.586
* The so light it comes

19:46.586 --> 19:47.587
* Freedom

19:48.455 --> 19:49.456
* Freedom

19:52.592 --> 19:53.593
[laughing]

19:55.595 --> 19:57.997
Alright, alright, you're goig
hard, ok.

19:57.997 --> 19:58.998
[Lia laughs]

19:59.799 --> 20:02.702
Ok, ok, are you ready for yor
safety meeting?

20:04.304 --> 20:06.172
Born ready, ok let's see it.

20:09.642 --> 20:11.778
I'm lucky I have you, this place

20:11.778 --> 20:13.946
would be hella
boring without you.

20:13.946 --> 20:14.881
Oh yea?

20:17.284 --> 20:18.285
Oh...

20:18.518 --> 20:19.519
* Freedom

20:20.720 --> 20:23.390
I kinda like you too, just a
smidge.

20:26.559 --> 20:27.327
Whatever.

20:27.327 --> 20:28.328
Nice.

20:29.796 --> 20:31.531
Are you sure we can smoke in
here?

20:31.531 --> 20:32.198
Yea.

20:32.565 --> 20:33.500
What about Ethan?

20:33.500 --> 20:34.701
What about him?

20:36.202 --> 20:37.470
He's your roommate.

20:37.470 --> 20:38.471
Was.

20:39.138 --> 20:40.807
What's up with you two?

20:40.807 --> 20:42.409
You went in on him pretty had
at dinner.

20:44.143 --> 20:46.646
There's just something
about him I don't

20:46.646 --> 20:49.248
like, that dude just
gives me a shady vibe.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.418
I feel that same way about Sean.

20:51.418 --> 20:53.720
I'm a girl and we
trust our intuition,

20:53.720 --> 20:55.755
something's not right about him.

20:56.656 --> 20:59.426
What grown ass man lives with
his grandma?

20:59.426 --> 21:01.093
Don't you mean, Gammie?

21:01.761 --> 21:04.063
Gammie made this, Gammie made
that.

21:05.332 --> 21:08.835
If you ask me, the whole shit
seems suspect.

21:10.069 --> 21:11.070
You know.

21:11.571 --> 21:14.407
Well if anything happens, t
you, right?

21:16.108 --> 21:17.410
I got your back.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.615
You ready for level two?

21:25.117 --> 21:26.853
It's kinda hot in here.

21:27.854 --> 21:29.856
I was thinking the same thin.

21:33.059 --> 21:34.260
[ominous music]

21:39.399 --> 21:40.400
What?

21:41.801 --> 21:42.802
Nothing.

21:56.616 --> 21:58.284
[footsteps in background]

21:58.818 --> 21:59.819
Yo!

22:02.955 --> 22:04.657
Yo! Who is it?

22:14.066 --> 22:15.301
[ominous sounds]

22:19.271 --> 22:20.673
I almost shot you!

22:21.441 --> 22:23.142
Why do you have a gun?

22:27.980 --> 22:30.783
So you gonna tell me why you
have that gun?

22:31.951 --> 22:34.186
Cause it's my right as an
American.

22:34.487 --> 22:37.023
Do you bring it to all your
movie sets?

22:37.023 --> 22:38.858
I take it every where I go.

22:40.827 --> 22:44.030
I never liked guns, not even
water guns.

22:44.864 --> 22:46.933
Not me, I've always loved .

22:48.134 --> 22:50.537
They were always around as a kid
too.

22:51.303 --> 22:53.440
My grandad had
this beautiful shotgun

22:53.440 --> 22:55.875
that sat above the
fireplace in the den.

22:56.342 --> 22:58.645
Till this day it's my favorie
gun.

23:00.146 --> 23:02.949
And all the violence
and carnage that's

23:02.949 --> 23:05.685
associated with them...
don't bother you?

23:06.152 --> 23:07.954
In my experience, this world

23:07.954 --> 23:10.122
doesn't give you
much of a choice.

23:13.292 --> 23:14.994
We always have a choice.

23:24.837 --> 23:26.973
What were you doing out there
all alone anyway?

23:28.541 --> 23:30.877
Well, your childhood was fd

23:30.877 --> 23:33.546
with guns...
mine with the outdoors.

23:34.380 --> 23:37.049
The house I was
raised in sat on a quarter

23:37.049 --> 23:39.318
acre of land and was
surrounded by trees.

23:39.318 --> 23:41.921
I always found myself sitting
under one.

23:41.921 --> 23:46.526
Just thinking, daydreamingd
eventually writing.

23:47.259 --> 23:50.329
So that's where I go when I look
for inspiration.

23:50.663 --> 23:51.764
It's my safe place.

23:51.764 --> 23:53.432
There are no safe places.

23:53.700 --> 23:56.102
Danger surrounds us everywhee
we go.

23:57.570 --> 24:00.773
That's a morbid outlook on
things, don't you think?

24:01.941 --> 24:03.610
[disconcerting music]

24:19.391 --> 24:20.426
[eery sounds]

24:31.403 --> 24:32.572
[phone ringing]

24:41.548 --> 24:42.749
[ominous music]

25:12.579 --> 25:14.246
Thanks for the ride to the
store.

25:14.246 --> 25:17.817
No problem, I had to get some
stuff for the house anyway.

25:24.657 --> 25:26.593
[woman]
Exactly, I just find some kid

25:26.593 --> 25:28.127
of time to do something.

25:38.971 --> 25:42.775
Ok, you get what you need and
I'll meet you at the registe.

25:45.712 --> 25:47.513
That guy looks so familiar.

25:49.782 --> 25:52.218
Look, I'm gonna talk to you
later, ok.

25:52.484 --> 25:54.153
I'll talk to you later.

25:57.690 --> 26:01.027
[light guitar music plays ovr
speak, newsman speaks]

26:07.867 --> 26:08.868
Hi.

26:11.237 --> 26:12.238
Hello.

26:13.806 --> 26:16.142
I heard you, what can I ger
you?

26:21.681 --> 26:23.415
Hey, you're that director.

26:24.383 --> 26:25.384
Yea.

26:25.384 --> 26:27.553
The director that did that movie
at that house.

26:27.553 --> 26:28.387
Uh huh.

26:28.387 --> 26:30.156
My sister she...

26:30.156 --> 26:32.825
she was working with you on that

26:32.825 --> 26:35.394
film and I haven't
seen her since.

26:37.163 --> 26:39.331
You all back shooting
that movie again? I thought

26:39.331 --> 26:41.600
you all learned your
lesson from the last time.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.535
What happened the last time?

26:43.535 --> 26:45.204
A disaster, that's what.

26:47.273 --> 26:48.941
I'm not following you.

26:49.375 --> 26:51.110
You don't know it, do you?

26:51.577 --> 26:54.246
Just like Sean to keep you in
the dark.

26:54.246 --> 26:56.415
You gotta be
careful with that Sean

26:56.415 --> 26:58.751
Bischer,
he isn't who he appears to b.

26:58.751 --> 26:59.886
And who he is?

27:00.619 --> 27:03.856
I don't know, ask the lastm
crew that was here.

27:04.523 --> 27:07.694
I mean I don't really keep track
of people after we wrap, so...

27:07.694 --> 27:11.563
No, no, no, she told me whe
she was... she told me, wee

27:11.563 --> 27:13.766
gonna meet up afterwards and she

27:13.766 --> 27:15.935
just wouldn't
disappear like that.

27:15.935 --> 27:18.905
Ok well she's a grown woman
so maybe she went out of tow,

27:18.905 --> 27:21.741
maybe she's at the beach.
I can't help you, I'm sorry.

27:22.041 --> 27:24.911
Just tell me where she is.
Just tell me where she

27:24.911 --> 27:27.646
is! Just tell me where she i,
I just wanna know.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.548
You gotta calm down right no,
I can't help

27:29.548 --> 27:31.383
you, I can't do anything
for you, I'm sorry.

27:31.383 --> 27:33.786
You're a liar, you're a fug
liar.

27:34.286 --> 27:36.455
You know exactly where she i!

27:36.455 --> 27:37.456
[ominous music]

27:37.456 --> 27:39.458
Do not mess with me right no.

27:40.793 --> 27:41.794
Stay there.

27:58.177 --> 28:01.080
Let's get out of here, these
people are crazy.

28:04.683 --> 28:06.285
[eery ominous music]

28:36.682 --> 28:40.352
Uh you mind telling me what that
was all about back there?

28:41.954 --> 28:43.655
What was what all about?

28:44.056 --> 28:46.358
Uh the argument
you were having with

28:46.358 --> 28:48.627
the woman in the
back of the store.

28:49.328 --> 28:51.530
That was nothing.

28:52.832 --> 28:56.302
That cashier said something
about a previous film crew.

28:56.803 --> 28:58.404
Oh she did, did she?

28:58.670 --> 29:02.341
Yea, what happened to the
previous film crew?

29:03.709 --> 29:06.846
What happened was they camt
here to make a film

29:07.479 --> 29:09.381
and between budgets and talet

29:09.381 --> 29:11.683
schedules we
couldn't make the film.

29:16.322 --> 29:19.025
I don't know man,
the cashier seemed pretty

29:19.025 --> 29:22.094
upset and so did the
girl you were arguing with.

29:24.330 --> 29:26.698
Look Ethan, I'm gonna
drop a little nugget on

29:26.698 --> 29:29.401
you about small towns,
they don't like outsiders.

29:30.002 --> 29:32.271
Especially ones
that threaten to turn

29:32.271 --> 29:34.907
their hick town into
the next Hollywood.

29:36.042 --> 29:39.411
I wouldn't put too much enery
into these people. I don't.

29:45.852 --> 29:47.519
What do we have here?

29:49.621 --> 29:52.458
[sighs]
Look... I hope he knows that

29:52.458 --> 29:53.792
we're not filming in this.

29:53.792 --> 29:55.694
That's why you bring your own
equipment.

29:55.694 --> 29:59.731
Oh yea? What do you think r
little zoom recorder is sa?

29:59.731 --> 30:03.802
Look, if this film is as bs
Sean says it is...

30:04.703 --> 30:06.805
we're gonna need better
equipment. For God sake...

30:07.473 --> 30:09.541
Abi can't even use
a damn laptop...

30:09.541 --> 30:11.577
hey Abi,
how you doing over there?

30:12.544 --> 30:13.545
Good?

30:14.280 --> 30:15.247
Huh? Ok.

30:15.647 --> 30:17.283
See what I'm saying?

30:21.420 --> 30:24.423
Now, this is more my speed

30:24.423 --> 30:28.394
my appetite, my flavor,
oh my gosh look at the

30:28.394 --> 30:32.231
legs and body on this beauty,
oh my mmm...

30:33.632 --> 30:34.600
This is a...

30:34.600 --> 30:39.571
Vintage Panasonic...
manufactured in 1987.

30:40.806 --> 30:41.807
Classic.

30:42.608 --> 30:44.076
You know your cameras.

30:44.076 --> 30:47.914
Told you, the best DP thise
of motherfucking Mississip.

30:49.848 --> 30:51.583
I'll leave you two
to get to know

30:51.583 --> 30:53.319
the equipment better. Abigai.

30:54.620 --> 30:56.622
Would you come with me pleas?

30:58.757 --> 31:01.660
If I'm DP'ing this we can
definitely use this.

31:02.128 --> 31:04.163
There's some... depending .

31:04.163 --> 31:05.664
With this as props.

31:11.270 --> 31:12.438
[ominous music]

31:24.283 --> 31:26.018
How's the script writing coming?

31:26.018 --> 31:27.819
I'm making some good notes...

31:27.819 --> 31:30.356
I'm focusing on character
development and I

31:30.356 --> 31:33.192
think I should be ready
to start writing soon.

31:33.993 --> 31:36.328
Good. When creating your
protagonist...

31:37.863 --> 31:40.466
make sure you choose
characteristics that

31:40.466 --> 31:42.969
align with the
narrative of the film.

31:42.969 --> 31:44.503
Is he a family man?

31:45.137 --> 31:46.738
Is he a betting man?

31:46.738 --> 31:48.174
Is he a man's man?

31:49.008 --> 31:51.643
When his back is up
against the wall, what

31:51.643 --> 31:54.546
is he going to do?
What does he have to lose?

31:56.682 --> 31:58.550
Do you know what empathy is?

32:00.919 --> 32:04.356
The ability to share and feel
the feelings of another?

32:04.756 --> 32:07.326
Every great script
captures empathy in a

32:07.326 --> 32:09.828
way that brings the
characters to life.

32:11.163 --> 32:13.765
Now if you want to
be a truly great writer

32:13.765 --> 32:16.168
you have to write
truly great scripts.

32:16.168 --> 32:19.538
Do you know the secret to
writing truly great scripts?

32:20.572 --> 32:21.573
Practice?

32:23.075 --> 32:25.111
Practice ain't hurt nobody bt

32:25.111 --> 32:27.113
no that's not
what I'm going for.

32:44.130 --> 32:45.564
Did you feel that?

32:47.199 --> 32:48.200
Feel what?

32:48.967 --> 32:51.770
That uncomfortable feeling
you're emitting.

32:52.471 --> 32:55.741
I sat down next to you on ths
bed and you felt...

32:55.741 --> 33:00.146
tense, apprehensive, confused
even.

33:03.415 --> 33:05.884
The secret to
writing a hero that

33:05.884 --> 33:08.954
everyone will
remember is vulnerability.

33:10.489 --> 33:12.158
You have got to be open.

33:13.825 --> 33:15.761
You've gotta go
deeper than you've

33:15.761 --> 33:17.629
ever gone before where it's dark

33:17.629 --> 33:19.565
and scary and
mucky and it's where

33:19.565 --> 33:21.433
comfort and security go to.

33:23.069 --> 33:27.306
Leaving behind only the put
form of yourself, of all o.

33:30.276 --> 33:34.246
There's only one thing than
survive there, one thing o.

33:37.183 --> 33:38.184
Truth.

33:41.753 --> 33:42.754
So.

33:46.192 --> 33:47.926
What do you want me to do?

33:52.030 --> 33:55.534
I want you to go to your safe
place...

33:57.203 --> 33:59.638
and I want you to let all the
fear in...

34:01.840 --> 34:04.343
and don't be afraid to make t
your bitch.

34:07.045 --> 34:08.780
Can you do that for me?

34:10.382 --> 34:11.383
I could try.

34:12.851 --> 34:14.853
I don't need you to try.

34:17.656 --> 34:19.558
I need you to make it happen.

34:21.293 --> 34:22.961
Can you do that for me?

34:26.898 --> 34:28.634
I could do that for you.

34:31.036 --> 34:32.037
Good.

34:37.543 --> 34:39.245
So what's this button for?

34:42.047 --> 34:44.216
So are you gonna tell me or
what? Ow.

34:44.550 --> 34:47.018
So don't mess with your
equipment, ok.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.222
That's the guy that I know.

34:50.922 --> 34:52.658
Give me a moment, alright.

34:55.894 --> 34:59.598
Hey, I got something to cos
to you.

35:00.266 --> 35:02.568
Yea? What's that?

35:03.169 --> 35:05.204
So you're like one of the man

35:05.204 --> 35:07.206
reasons why I
became a filmmaker.

35:07.673 --> 35:08.874
Yea, seriously.

35:10.442 --> 35:11.443
Yea.

35:17.683 --> 35:20.252
I guess it was probably whenI
was like 11 or 12.

35:21.287 --> 35:24.022
I must have been on my fourth
foster home.

35:24.690 --> 35:28.294
And this one was by far the
worst.

35:29.361 --> 35:30.362
Yea.

35:30.896 --> 35:33.765
I got scars and cigarette s
to prove it.

35:36.568 --> 35:39.471
Every night was
just a particular

35:39.471 --> 35:41.740
chaos and horror for me.

35:44.376 --> 35:46.044
Except for one night.

35:47.979 --> 35:48.980
Nah.

35:49.748 --> 35:52.484
One night something
made me feel like

35:52.484 --> 35:55.153
I was, someone else,
somewhere else.

35:56.288 --> 35:58.056
Gave me a glimmer of hope.

36:00.058 --> 36:02.127
It was your movie, Heartbr.

36:03.629 --> 36:06.832
I'll admit, I wasn't too cray
about the story line

36:07.466 --> 36:11.503
but the visual, just the vl
story you told

36:12.304 --> 36:16.141
was just some of the best I'e
ever seen, still to this day.

36:16.141 --> 36:18.944
The direction, the angles and
the lighting.

36:19.611 --> 36:20.779
Just brilliant.

36:22.848 --> 36:24.182
Brilliant my man.

36:24.983 --> 36:27.118
I knew right then and there
that...

36:29.455 --> 36:31.189
I wanted to be a filmmaker...

36:32.358 --> 36:33.359
and uh...

36:34.693 --> 36:37.162
I would tell anyone that woud
listen.

36:38.497 --> 36:40.165
Even my foster parents.

36:41.099 --> 36:46.838
They would laugh of course bt
shit, see me now, right?

36:51.510 --> 36:54.946
Wait a minute, you remembered
the scene in the kitchen...

36:56.147 --> 36:57.349
with the uncle?

36:57.716 --> 37:01.787
Yes, that was the trippy ass
scene, yes!

37:02.288 --> 37:03.289
Yes.

37:05.657 --> 37:07.659
Does a bear in
the woods wipe his

37:07.659 --> 37:09.661
ass with a fluffy white bunn?

37:11.530 --> 37:13.465
I don't know what that means.

37:14.466 --> 37:15.734
That means, yes.

37:16.335 --> 37:20.372
Yes, of course I want the great
Ethan Shaw to teach me. God yes.

37:22.073 --> 37:23.642
Alright, let me see if I

37:23.642 --> 37:25.744
remember this
blocking correctly.

37:26.712 --> 37:29.315
Lia, I'm gonna need your help
with this.

37:30.816 --> 37:34.386
Alright, I need you to stand
right here.

37:34.386 --> 37:35.387
Ok.

37:35.854 --> 37:39.891
And I need you a little fur
back, right there.

37:50.936 --> 37:54.406
Hey all, this is Sean.
I would like everyone to meet me

37:54.406 --> 37:57.876
in the living room at 8pm
for tonight's entertainment.

38:26.605 --> 38:28.139
It's about to go down.

38:28.139 --> 38:29.040
Shh.

38:29.040 --> 38:31.042
[tense music plays from movi]

38:33.144 --> 38:34.380
[ominous music]

38:40.486 --> 38:41.487
Hello?

38:42.988 --> 38:43.989
Hello?

38:47.292 --> 38:47.926
Hello?

38:48.326 --> 38:49.395
[tense music]

38:49.628 --> 38:50.762
[screams]

38:50.762 --> 38:52.464
Oh no, she's about to die, n.

38:54.466 --> 38:56.134
Are you always this loud?

38:58.003 --> 39:00.906
Please, no please don't

39:02.808 --> 39:03.809
Please, no.

39:04.075 --> 39:05.076
[screams]

39:17.423 --> 39:19.858
Martha Bischer? Is she relatd
to you?

39:20.526 --> 39:21.993
She's my Gammie.

39:21.993 --> 39:24.863
Whoa, that hot, that woman ws
your grandma?

39:26.765 --> 39:28.934
Yea, she was, she is an actress.

39:29.535 --> 39:31.470
She starred in over 50 films.

39:31.837 --> 39:34.272
This one was always
my favorite though.

39:34.272 --> 39:36.442
This film led to
this very moment.

39:38.176 --> 39:39.978
It all started with Gammie.

39:41.547 --> 39:43.849
I like how at the
end it showed the

39:43.849 --> 39:46.151
shadow instead of
the actual murder.

39:46.151 --> 39:49.020
Yea, see a great director,
Ethan...

39:50.722 --> 39:53.525
Does a great job of showing fear
in action.

39:55.126 --> 39:58.396
See that's the beautiful thig
about horror. It's predicated

39:58.396 --> 40:01.467
on the universal ideology
that we all desire illusion.

40:02.400 --> 40:05.070
We have a fundamental need to be
tricked.

40:06.137 --> 40:09.040
It's the trick that makes the
treat sweet.

40:09.040 --> 40:10.041
[doorbell]

40:19.851 --> 40:20.986
You're early!

40:20.986 --> 40:23.154
Yea, we decided
to drive straight here

40:23.154 --> 40:25.924
instead of spending
the night in Fort Pierce.

40:25.924 --> 40:27.559
You cool with that?

40:27.559 --> 40:29.528
Of course, please come in!

40:29.528 --> 40:30.896
Yea, let's do it.

40:32.698 --> 40:35.734
I'll get someone to help you
with the bags. Niko!

40:39.004 --> 40:40.939
This will just take a minute.

40:45.744 --> 40:46.945
[ominous music]

40:53.719 --> 40:54.352
Please.

40:54.720 --> 40:56.522
Our bags gonna be straight?

40:57.088 --> 41:00.025
Everyone, I'd like to intre
you to our actors.

41:00.025 --> 41:01.292

Hey all, what's up.

41:02.761 --> 41:04.195
What up, what up.

41:04.195 --> 41:09.568
This is Derek, Lia, Ethan, ad
our writer Abigail.

41:09.801 --> 41:11.469
Abigail, what's up girl? You and

41:11.469 --> 41:13.138
me need to talk,
I need some more

41:13.138 --> 41:14.973
scenes in the script,
maybe you can

41:14.973 --> 41:16.775
write me in some
more scenes girl.

41:17.442 --> 41:18.443
Maybe.

41:18.977 --> 41:20.979
Well listen, it's getting
very late. How about

41:20.979 --> 41:22.981
we all get to know each
other over breakfast? I'm

41:22.981 --> 41:25.283
sure you two would like
to rest after your long driv.

41:25.283 --> 41:26.484
[both]
Yes.

41:26.484 --> 41:28.554
Alright, your rooms are right
this way, let me show you.

41:28.554 --> 41:31.489
Alright, holla at you all later,
especially you Abigail.

41:50.508 --> 41:51.577
[Abigail yells]

41:51.577 --> 41:53.344
No, no, no, it's me, Tasha.

41:55.614 --> 41:56.748
What's going on?

41:56.748 --> 41:58.750
Nothing, I have to go to
the bathroom. The other

41:58.750 --> 42:01.286
bathroom ain't got not toilet
tissue so I came in here.

42:01.286 --> 42:04.489
It's ok I think that moviet
got to me a little bit.

42:05.090 --> 42:06.091
What movie?

42:06.357 --> 42:07.826
[Abigail laughing]

42:09.995 --> 42:11.697
[disconcerting music]

42:22.641 --> 42:25.110
Hey, just coming to get yor
breakfast.

42:25.110 --> 42:28.379
Oh I never got a chance to thank
you for last night.

42:28.780 --> 42:29.848
What I do?

42:29.848 --> 42:31.983
You thought I was in
danger and you came running.

42:31.983 --> 42:33.985
That's more than what
most people would do?

42:33.985 --> 42:36.054
That was nothing, I did that for
anybody.

42:37.355 --> 42:39.157
No, you wouldn't.

42:40.191 --> 42:42.961
I truly believe that you dont
care about anybody else

42:42.961 --> 42:45.697
here. If they were in danger,
you wouldn't bat an eye.

42:46.665 --> 42:50.235
If you believe that then ye
got me pegged all wrong.

42:50.235 --> 42:51.236
[door shuts]

42:52.671 --> 42:54.840
What are you guys doing up here?

42:54.840 --> 42:57.008
Breakfast is getting cold,
go eat.

43:18.930 --> 43:24.369
Yea baby, breakfast, that's what
I'm talking about. Food.

43:41.853 --> 43:45.190
I gotta find cell service.l
be outside.

43:45.190 --> 43:46.858
Oh let me get us

43:46.858 --> 43:48.526
coffee and I'll
meet you out there?

43:48.526 --> 43:50.228
If you don't mind
there's something

43:50.228 --> 43:51.763
I wanted to talk to you abou.

43:52.030 --> 43:54.032
Ok, I'll be in the yard.

44:00.138 --> 44:02.207

44:02.808 --> 44:04.575
Hey, does he always eat like

44:09.981 --> 44:13.985

44:14.419 --> 44:17.255
Yo, Sean been cooking for you

He been making you

44:21.592 --> 44:24.062

44:24.062 --> 44:25.063
Gammie does.

44:25.630 --> 44:26.397
Who?

44:26.397 --> 44:26.998
Gammie.

44:27.265 --> 44:29.400
Sean's grandmother. According to

44:29.400 --> 44:31.469
him she makes
all of these meals.

44:32.804 --> 44:34.840
Shit, I should of known,
ain't nobody

44:34.840 --> 44:36.842

44:37.442 --> 44:39.677
Anyway, where she at?
Cause I need

44:39.677 --> 44:41.913

damn pancakes.

44:41.913 --> 44:42.914
Tell me.

44:43.181 --> 44:46.517
That's just the thing, like none
of us have ever seen her.

44:46.517 --> 44:47.786
Like seen her cooking?

44:47.786 --> 44:51.122
No, like ever. She's like a
ghost.

44:51.957 --> 44:54.860
A ghost that cooks bomb ass
food. Don't hate on my Gramm.

44:54.860 --> 44:58.329
Vine! Boo!

44:58.764 --> 45:00.098
God yea.

45:00.098 --> 45:01.199
[laughing]

45:01.199 --> 45:02.433
[phone ringing]

45:09.875 --> 45:12.110
So, nobody gonna answer that?

45:13.378 --> 45:14.712
No one ever does.

45:35.633 --> 45:37.168
Yo, you blocked me!

45:37.903 --> 45:41.840
Cora, I wanna speak to my
daughter. Unblock me now!

45:46.711 --> 45:47.712
You ok?

45:48.679 --> 45:51.549
Yea, just some personal
bullshit.

45:52.918 --> 45:54.419
I'll be alright.

45:54.419 --> 45:55.553
You sure?

45:55.553 --> 45:56.521
Yea.

45:57.923 --> 46:00.091
What'd you wanna talk to me
about?

46:01.659 --> 46:02.660
Can we sit?

46:06.331 --> 46:08.733
I don't know how to ask you
this...

46:08.733 --> 46:09.734
Ask me what?

46:10.735 --> 46:11.870
[mischievous music]

46:11.870 --> 46:13.604
I know you're not a thief I

46:13.604 --> 46:15.573
need you to steal
something for me

46:15.941 --> 46:18.376
well actually borrow
because we are gonna

46:18.376 --> 46:21.346
return it but yea first
it's gonna be stealing.

46:22.047 --> 46:23.048
Steal what?

46:26.184 --> 46:28.887
On a desk in Sean's room there's
a script

46:29.587 --> 46:33.424
with the title of the movie that
I'm supposed to be writing.

46:33.424 --> 46:35.961
Wait a minute, I'm confused.
Why are you supposed

46:35.961 --> 46:38.563
to be writing a script if
we already have one?

46:38.563 --> 46:41.799
I don't know. Which is why I
need to read the script.

46:42.934 --> 46:44.769
It's not uncommon for prods

46:44.769 --> 46:46.571
to want a complete
rewrite but...

46:48.406 --> 46:50.375
I haven't been
able to come up with

46:50.375 --> 46:52.377
anything,
so maybe if I could just

46:52.377 --> 46:54.445
see what he already
has and maybe get

46:54.445 --> 46:56.614
an idea of what
he's looking for...

46:56.614 --> 46:57.615
I'll do it.

46:57.615 --> 46:58.616
You will?

47:00.785 --> 47:01.786
Thank you.

47:03.221 --> 47:06.724
I'm not normally a criminal it's
just that this is my big break

47:06.724 --> 47:10.161
and I really don't wanna mess
things up, you know how it i.

47:12.630 --> 47:14.832
Not that you messed up
so you should know how

47:14.832 --> 47:17.002
it is but we all mess up,
it's a part of life.

47:17.335 --> 47:20.838
You just happened to do yours
publicly, which is fine...

47:22.673 --> 47:24.175
I should probably stop talkig
now.

47:24.175 --> 47:25.911
Yea, you probably should.

47:28.980 --> 47:32.984
The truth is I wasn't readr
the fame and what came witt

47:33.484 --> 47:35.820
and I made the mistake
any 19 year old would

47:35.820 --> 47:38.156
have and I just did it
publicly like you said.

47:38.789 --> 47:40.658
Well if you ask me, I think

47:40.658 --> 47:42.994
you're about due
for a come back.

47:43.828 --> 47:44.829
I hope so.

47:46.797 --> 47:49.800
Now look, if I'm gonna
steal this for you we need

47:49.800 --> 47:52.703
to do it later and I'm
gonna need a diversion.

47:55.606 --> 47:56.807
[ominous music]

48:17.963 --> 48:18.696

48:18.696 --> 48:19.397
Hey.

48:19.397 --> 48:20.698
How can I help you?

48:20.698 --> 48:22.800
Wanted to know if we couldk
horror movies.

48:23.801 --> 48:25.903
My favorite subject, come on in.

48:29.040 --> 48:30.041
Please.

48:34.745 --> 48:35.746
Talk to me.

48:36.214 --> 48:39.250
Alright well you spoke
about the different rules

48:39.250 --> 48:42.320
and disciplines that
every horror film follows...

48:43.221 --> 48:46.257
and since we're making thet
horror film ever...

48:47.825 --> 48:50.028
I wanted to know...
what rules do you

48:50.028 --> 48:52.197
think that this
film should follow.

48:52.597 --> 48:55.700
Ok, well to me there
are five essential

48:55.700 --> 48:58.836
elements to every
great horror movie.

48:59.937 --> 49:02.073
One, fear.

49:03.774 --> 49:05.743
Two, a shower scene.

49:07.712 --> 49:10.748
Three, unsuspecting victims.

49:12.683 --> 49:15.886
Four, a great big house.

49:17.422 --> 49:18.356
And five...

49:18.356 --> 49:19.357
[knocking]

49:20.958 --> 49:23.728
Seems my room is the popular
room tonight, excuse me.

49:28.866 --> 49:29.967
Hey.

49:29.967 --> 49:32.237
Can I talk to you for a se?

49:32.237 --> 49:33.238
Yea.

49:34.572 --> 49:36.107
I'll be right back.

49:39.577 --> 49:40.778
[ominous music]

49:53.791 --> 49:55.126
Sorry about that.

49:59.297 --> 50:00.131
Where were we?

50:00.131 --> 50:01.066
Number 5?

50:01.066 --> 50:02.067
Right, 5.

50:03.101 --> 50:05.236
A twist, you gotta have a twist.

50:06.437 --> 50:08.239
See horror movies are tricky,
you

50:08.239 --> 50:10.341
can't just kill people
for 90 minutes.

50:11.142 --> 50:13.911
So there's a lot of fluff,
but if you can

50:13.911 --> 50:16.681
make the fluff mean
something at the end...

50:18.083 --> 50:19.517
you got a jackpot.

50:19.517 --> 50:22.253
What would be a good twist fr
this movie?

50:22.853 --> 50:24.689
You gotta establish
these elements in

50:24.689 --> 50:26.957
order. So first you
have to establish fear.

50:28.826 --> 50:29.994
And how do we do that?

50:29.994 --> 50:33.030
You're the director, Ethan. I'll
leave that to you.

50:35.633 --> 50:38.669
I'm gonna leave you with tha,
Ethan. Tomorrow is just a

50:38.669 --> 50:42.039
killer of a day and I need to
get some rest. You should to.

50:47.612 --> 50:49.147
Knock 'em dead man.

50:55.686 --> 50:57.355
[disconcerting music]

51:02.293 --> 51:03.494
[knocking]

51:03.494 --> 51:04.829
[Abigail]
Come in.

51:14.205 --> 51:15.706
What you got there?

51:16.174 --> 51:17.742
I'm just journaling.

51:18.409 --> 51:20.978
I write before I go to bed,
helps sooth my mind.

51:21.746 --> 51:23.748
Does anything but that for m.

51:24.649 --> 51:26.884
The thought of my
innermost feelings

51:26.884 --> 51:28.819
conveyed on a sheet of paper,

51:29.187 --> 51:30.188
in a book.

51:32.157 --> 51:33.824
It makes me feel exposed.

51:36.026 --> 51:38.563
All the reason why you should
have one.

51:40.198 --> 51:41.499
It helps, Ethan.

51:43.501 --> 51:45.903
You know when I was a kid.

51:47.572 --> 51:50.275
My parents had a lot of
arguments.

51:52.410 --> 51:54.279
I can remember so many times,

51:54.279 --> 51:56.681
standing on the
top of the staircase,

51:56.681 --> 52:00.418
just screaming at them. "Just
stop it you're scaring me!"

52:04.121 --> 52:07.525
After that they just continud
in a more hushed voice.

52:09.627 --> 52:13.698
To this day I wonder if
whispers...

52:14.432 --> 52:17.034
have more power and depth whn
we speak?

52:18.636 --> 52:22.473
If yelling is the unravelif
a marriage then...

52:23.241 --> 52:27.445
whispers must be the war of
total destruction.

52:29.414 --> 52:30.415
Anyway.

52:31.616 --> 52:34.419
I would take my journal
and hide under the

52:34.419 --> 52:37.154
covers with a flashlight
and I would write.

52:38.055 --> 52:41.058
That was just my way of makig
everything right.

52:45.996 --> 52:48.766
Well, I have a gift for you.

52:50.301 --> 52:51.569
[Abigail laughs]

53:04.915 --> 53:07.418
[hookah bubbling, music in
background]

53:14.692 --> 53:17.127
Damn! Smoking, you're killing my
shit.

53:17.428 --> 53:20.465
That, yo! Whoa wait a minute,
you ok? Are you alright?

53:21.866 --> 53:23.033
Water.

53:23.033 --> 53:27.171
Ah hell no, no, no, no. I jut
got up here, you go.

53:27.505 --> 53:28.172
Nah.

53:28.539 --> 53:30.207
What if Niko's out there?

53:30.975 --> 53:31.809
[coughing]

53:31.809 --> 53:33.944
Shit, alright, alright, I'll go.

53:34.979 --> 53:36.847
This is the last I'm
going downstairs so if

53:36.847 --> 53:38.683
you want something else,
just let me know.

53:38.949 --> 53:39.617
Now.

53:39.617 --> 53:40.551
Just water.

53:40.551 --> 53:42.453
Oh you just cleared up easy,

53:43.153 --> 53:44.855

53:44.855 --> 53:45.990

53:55.966 --> 53:56.967
Nice.

54:06.844 --> 54:08.713
Damn, I see you player.

54:23.894 --> 54:25.563
[Derek, low voice]

54:27.498 --> 54:28.899

54:51.889 --> 54:54.892

54:55.860 --> 54:58.563
Let's go shoot. Let's go fucking

Come on, check me out.

55:21.719 --> 55:23.320
Alright,

55:23.320 --> 55:24.922

Give it to me.

55:24.922 --> 55:27.057
Well I'd like to thank the
Academy for recognizing

55:27.057 --> 55:28.993
me in my role in Call Time...
I mean when I

55:28.993 --> 55:30.995
first got on the set I
thought it wasn't gonna

55:30.995 --> 55:33.598
happen either, I mean the
whole filming and the movie

55:33.598 --> 55:38.235
but obviously it did because I'm
getting this award, biotch.

55:38.235 --> 55:40.505
Philip! Let me hear your Oscr
speech mate.

55:40.505 --> 55:43.140
Oh, first and foremost I have to
thank God...

55:43.140 --> 55:43.974
[Derek]
Hallelujah.

55:43.974 --> 55:45.910

things are possible.

55:49.246 --> 55:51.248

What other crew?

57:34.418 --> 57:38.122
Sean said he had trouble working
with another filming crew.

57:38.422 --> 57:40.791

1:01:28.152 --> 1:01:29.353
What's wrong, daddy?

1:01:29.353 --> 1:01:31.321

None of you all care what
happened to her?

1:02:19.970 --> 1:02:21.505
Nobody said we didn't care.
We just

Watch out.

1:02:23.707 --> 1:02:25.375

1:02:27.077 --> 1:02:28.813
Why would you think that?

1:02:28.813 --> 1:02:31.481
He would think that
being that he was the last

1:02:31.481 --> 1:02:34.218
person to see Abigail
before she went missing.

1:02:34.218 --> 1:02:35.219
Right.

1:02:35.886 --> 1:02:36.921
Right, Ethan?

1:02:37.254 --> 1:02:39.089
What are you trying to say?

1:02:39.824 --> 1:02:41.025
[ominous music]

1:02:41.358 --> 1:02:43.227
See I remember
this job I used to

1:02:43.227 --> 1:02:45.095
work at, someone stole my phone.

1:02:45.429 --> 1:02:47.998
See a few coworkers would ,
look for about

1:02:47.998 --> 1:02:50.767
two minutes and then
go back to their busy lives.

1:02:52.236 --> 1:02:55.940
Except this one coworker, you
see the brother unfortunatel.

1:02:57.274 --> 1:03:00.010
I considered him a friend.
He looked up

1:03:00.010 --> 1:03:02.847
and down all day
long for that phone.

1:03:02.847 --> 1:03:04.514
Every nook and cranny.

1:03:05.082 --> 1:03:06.083
Turns out...

1:03:07.784 --> 1:03:10.554
he was the one that had it te
whole time.

1:03:11.055 --> 1:03:14.424
Yea, well I'm not one of your
shitty friends.

1:03:14.925 --> 1:03:15.926
[sniffs]

1:03:16.726 --> 1:03:18.395
Bro, sure smells like it.

1:03:18.728 --> 1:03:19.729
[laughing]

1:03:20.197 --> 1:03:21.899
He's not even worth it.

1:03:22.933 --> 1:03:23.968
What you say?

1:03:24.301 --> 1:03:25.302
Excuse you?

1:03:26.270 --> 1:03:27.404
Who's not worth it?

1:03:27.404 --> 1:03:28.772
You motherfucker.

1:03:28.772 --> 1:03:29.773
I get it.

1:03:30.307 --> 1:03:33.777
You two known each other a week
and now you're Bonnie and Clyde.

1:03:33.777 --> 1:03:35.479
Bro, you know your
girl about the same

1:03:35.479 --> 1:03:37.247
amount of time.
Like, are you serious?

1:03:38.148 --> 1:03:40.150
Ethan, Ethan...

1:03:40.617 --> 1:03:44.454
Why? Why is it that women always
run away from you?

1:03:44.989 --> 1:03:47.992
First, your baby momma and nw
the hippy chick.

1:03:48.592 --> 1:03:50.627
Abigail? You know what guys,
I bet she's out

1:03:50.627 --> 1:03:52.997
back just slamming it,
you know just fucking some

1:03:52.997 --> 1:03:55.332
tree, just giving it all
she got, you know just

1:03:55.332 --> 1:03:57.634
planting it, because she l,
you know she's...

1:03:58.002 --> 1:03:59.236
[Philip]
Yo, yo, yo, yo!

1:03:59.236 --> 1:04:01.571
Yo, yo, yo, yo!
No, no, no, fuck that

1:04:01.571 --> 1:04:04.074
Philip, let them fight.
Let them fight.

1:04:04.074 --> 1:04:05.275
Hey, come one.

1:04:05.275 --> 1:04:06.476
[phone ringing]

1:04:08.178 --> 1:04:11.181
Hey, I'm just playing buddy.I
like Abigail too.

1:04:19.823 --> 1:04:21.525
Ethan, hey, how you doing?

1:04:22.192 --> 1:04:23.660
Abigail's missing.

1:04:24.294 --> 1:04:27.864
Oh, you know I did notice she
wasn't around much today.

1:04:27.864 --> 1:04:29.533
Well what do we do?

1:04:29.533 --> 1:04:30.600
[tense music]

1:04:31.268 --> 1:04:33.337
You're right, you're right,
someones missing

1:04:33.337 --> 1:04:35.205
we need to take care of it.
I need to

1:04:35.205 --> 1:04:37.207
run downstairs real fast,
I'll come right

1:04:37.207 --> 1:04:39.176
back up, we'll figure
the whole thing out.

1:05:38.535 --> 1:05:40.204
[tense dramatic music]

1:06:23.080 --> 1:06:24.914
[Sean]
I spend my entire life in the

1:06:24.914 --> 1:06:25.982
city, embarrassed.

1:06:27.151 --> 1:06:29.619
Caged up, stuck like a rata
hole.

1:06:31.788 --> 1:06:34.791
I know what it's like to fall
from glory, Ethan.

1:06:35.392 --> 1:06:37.061
[disconcerting music]

1:06:38.428 --> 1:06:40.730
When I started my
obsession to make

1:06:40.730 --> 1:06:42.966
the greatest horror film ever...

1:06:44.234 --> 1:06:47.404
They said I was crazy,
they said I went mad...

1:06:48.472 --> 1:06:52.342
and they were right, only not in
the sense that I lost my mind.

1:06:54.010 --> 1:06:56.012
In the sense that I got angr.

1:06:56.680 --> 1:06:58.782
Really, really, angry.

1:07:00.484 --> 1:07:03.487
And that gave me the fuel to
keep going no matter what.

1:07:03.487 --> 1:07:05.422
You were planning this all
along.

1:07:05.422 --> 1:07:07.657
Well I had some help.

1:07:13.197 --> 1:07:15.599
And how does this make you nt
crazy?

1:07:15.832 --> 1:07:18.602
If you do something over
and over and over again you

1:07:18.602 --> 1:07:21.271
eventually get it right.
It doesn't matter if you

1:07:21.271 --> 1:07:24.007
were doing it wrong or
doing it right, if you do it

1:07:24.007 --> 1:07:27.010
enough, eventually the day
comes that you do it right.

1:07:28.011 --> 1:07:30.180
Well today is that day, Etha.

1:07:34.218 --> 1:07:35.885
What do you need me for?

1:07:37.053 --> 1:07:38.888
The million dollar question.

1:07:39.689 --> 1:07:41.858
Why is Ethan Shaw needed?

1:07:43.560 --> 1:07:47.497
Well I need you to do what yu
do best.

1:07:48.665 --> 1:07:51.568
Direct... See I realized
something was missing

1:07:51.568 --> 1:07:54.238
the first couple of
times around on this.

1:07:55.205 --> 1:07:58.908
I guess it's true what they say,
the third times the charm.

1:07:59.543 --> 1:08:03.880
See my talent is in producing, I
will produce...

1:08:04.381 --> 1:08:06.383
The greatest horror film ever...

1:08:07.384 --> 1:08:12.822
and I need you to direct the
greatest horror film ever.

1:08:14.090 --> 1:08:16.593
And go along with your psychotic
plan?

1:08:18.862 --> 1:08:20.096
Why would I do that?

1:08:20.096 --> 1:08:22.532
Because you're needed again,
Ethan!

1:08:24.268 --> 1:08:26.436
You and I are both alike in that

1:08:26.436 --> 1:08:28.538
regard,
we both need to be needed.

1:08:30.274 --> 1:08:32.409
Most of the people
in the industry

1:08:32.409 --> 1:08:34.278
suffer from this affliction.

1:08:34.278 --> 1:08:36.246
This is your chance
to show them what

1:08:36.246 --> 1:08:38.215
happens when
they shit all over you.

1:08:39.249 --> 1:08:41.385
When they throw
mud all over your

1:08:41.385 --> 1:08:43.453
name and bury
you with the bones!

1:08:43.887 --> 1:08:45.555
They left us for dead!

1:08:46.690 --> 1:08:50.694
The media, the industry, our
friends, our families.

1:08:52.896 --> 1:08:55.031
They all turned their back on
us.

1:08:55.532 --> 1:08:58.468
Now this movie is your chance to
put your name right back on top

1:08:58.468 --> 1:09:00.136
where it belongs
and it will prove

1:09:00.136 --> 1:09:01.771
to them that they
were all wrong!

1:09:02.706 --> 1:09:04.274
They were all wrong!

1:09:04.541 --> 1:09:06.310
[tense disconcerting music]

1:09:09.313 --> 1:09:11.215
You didn't have to kill her.

1:09:13.750 --> 1:09:16.152
Her family will come looking for
her.

1:09:17.387 --> 1:09:21.958
When they don't find her,
they'll come find you.

1:09:23.126 --> 1:09:27.331
No, did you ever wonder hou
were selected for this pro?

1:09:28.164 --> 1:09:30.900
All of you? I couldn't pick just
anybody!

1:09:31.901 --> 1:09:34.771
I had to be very calculatin
my selections

1:09:35.305 --> 1:09:38.908
and the one thing that you al
have in common is family.

1:09:39.643 --> 1:09:42.679
Everyone here has little to o
family.

1:09:43.580 --> 1:09:45.148
Or you're estranged.

1:09:45.682 --> 1:09:48.685
You also have some film talet
but not too much.

1:09:50.287 --> 1:09:53.957
So I go to small town indie film
fests!

1:09:55.292 --> 1:09:57.994
And by the way you
were completely robbed on

1:09:57.994 --> 1:10:00.630
your best director
but I took care of that...

1:10:02.599 --> 1:10:04.200
What'd you do to him?

1:10:08.672 --> 1:10:11.341
There are two ways out of ,
Ethan...

1:10:11.341 --> 1:10:13.943
and I know that right
now you're already

1:10:13.943 --> 1:10:16.513
thinking,
maybe death isn't all that!

1:10:16.513 --> 1:10:19.182
No more broken relationships,
no more arguments over

1:10:19.182 --> 1:10:21.685
money, no more custody bat,
no more regrets.

1:10:22.852 --> 1:10:30.026
Or join me, Ethan, and direc.

1:10:30.694 --> 1:10:33.196
Direct these people
to their deaths, it's

1:10:33.196 --> 1:10:35.532
your chance to
make everything right

1:10:36.633 --> 1:10:40.504
and it's your chance to bee
man that you're supposed t.

1:10:41.405 --> 1:10:42.706
How old is Ally?

1:10:44.574 --> 1:10:47.544
She's... she's like 8, 8.

1:10:47.544 --> 1:10:49.646
Yea, that's not too late.

1:10:50.980 --> 1:10:54.318
It's not too late for her to see
her daddy as a hero

1:10:54.818 --> 1:10:56.219
and not a villain.

1:11:02.258 --> 1:11:03.527

1:12:19.302 --> 1:12:20.970
Hey everybody, listen up.

1:12:21.471 --> 1:12:22.606
This is Ethan.

1:12:23.139 --> 1:12:25.909
I don't have time to explain
this but Sean...

1:12:26.843 --> 1:12:29.846
he locked me in this room
and right now him and Niko

1:12:29.846 --> 1:12:32.749
are on their way to kill
every single one of you.

1:12:33.517 --> 1:12:35.619
You guys are in the attic,
right?

1:12:35.619 --> 1:12:37.454
Of course, he knows
we're in the attic, this

1:12:37.454 --> 1:12:39.188
is where we always hang out.
Come on guys.

1:12:40.857 --> 1:12:43.793
Yo if he's watching then wath
this. Motherfucker.

1:12:46.930 --> 1:12:50.133
What a cry baby. Yo, you're a
bitch. Ethan.

1:12:50.133 --> 1:12:53.169
Derek there's really no
time for middle fingers

1:12:53.169 --> 1:12:55.839
since Niko's on her
way to chop 'em off.

1:12:58.207 --> 1:13:00.143
Yo, so what should we do?

1:13:00.777 --> 1:13:02.145
You need to get out.

1:13:02.145 --> 1:13:04.213
You ain't got to tell me t.

1:13:52.095 --> 1:13:53.096
Good, check.

1:13:56.566 --> 1:13:59.836
You need to get out of there
now. Go to the other side

1:13:59.836 --> 1:14:03.072
of the attic, there's a
stairway, leads to a back .

1:14:03.439 --> 1:14:05.108
That'll take you outside.

1:14:11.114 --> 1:14:12.782
[tense ominous music]

1:14:19.589 --> 1:14:21.725
[Philip]
Let's go. Come on.

1:14:23.026 --> 1:14:24.393
This can't be happening.

1:14:24.393 --> 1:14:27.463
Yo fuck this shit yo.
I survived the toughest parts

1:14:27.463 --> 1:14:30.534

I'm dying in the boondocks.

Look, look, nobodies gonna die,
alright? We're gonna be alright.

1:14:34.571 --> 1:14:39.142
Look... we can make it out alive
if we stick together. Ok all?

He's right, he's right.

1:14:41.410 --> 1:14:43.112
What are we gonna do?

1:14:45.248 --> 1:14:46.282
Take the van.

1:14:47.216 --> 1:14:48.752
[Philip]
So come on with me.

1:14:49.619 --> 1:14:51.287
[tense dramatic music]

1:15:03.466 --> 1:15:04.734
Check the visor.

1:15:07.837 --> 1:15:11.240
Yo, why don't we just sit hee
and wait for help. Yo?

1:15:11.240 --> 1:15:13.442
And be trapped like sitting
ducks? No.

1:15:13.442 --> 1:15:14.911
We could just run.

1:15:15.144 --> 1:15:17.313
No, the van is our best bet, ok?

1:15:18.347 --> 1:15:19.348
Shit.

1:15:19.949 --> 1:15:23.587
I saw a rack of keys hangiy
the front door.

1:15:23.953 --> 1:15:26.155
You sure? You sure?

1:15:26.155 --> 1:15:27.824
[Derek]
I'm pretty sure.

1:15:28.091 --> 1:15:29.759
Man fuck this shit.

1:15:29.759 --> 1:15:31.460
Why don't one of

1:15:33.462 --> 1:15:35.665
I mean who knows how to hot-wire

1:15:35.665 --> 1:15:36.666
Oh shit.

1:15:37.300 --> 1:15:38.301
Nobody?

1:15:42.138 --> 1:15:44.974
Exactly, look, how we gonnt

1:15:47.276 --> 1:15:49.178
Ethan, we need your help man.

1:15:50.179 --> 1:15:52.181
The coast is clear for now.
Go through

1:15:52.181 --> 1:15:53.950
the front door and grab the key.

1:15:54.450 --> 1:15:56.219
It should be unlocked.

1:15:56.219 --> 1:15:58.487
Alright look,
