00:00.237 --> 00:02.572
<i>Previously on</i> Sanctuary...

00:03.223 --> 00:05.226
Prepare to meet
Jekyll and Hyde.

00:06.049 --> 00:07.504
Death of a child,

00:07.505 --> 00:08.779
never quite the same
after that, is it?

00:10.476 --> 00:11.509
I'm Fallon.

00:11.511 --> 00:12.577
Ranna's chief counsel.

00:12.579 --> 00:13.612
You're a Quinterran.

00:13.614 --> 00:14.780
I'm a Herusan.

00:14.782 --> 00:16.015
Original offshoot
of the species.

00:16.018 --> 00:19.522
After a while, Worth's
experiments grew too dangerous.

00:19.524 --> 00:20.724
Time dilation experiments.

00:20.726 --> 00:22.560
I can tell you
there was an accident.

00:22.562 --> 00:24.028
Hundreds died.

00:24.030 --> 00:26.499
This city has had
too much power for too long.

00:26.501 --> 00:28.834
Frankly, I don't care
if you depose Ranna.

00:28.836 --> 00:31.371
The device has a far more
meaningful destiny.

00:34.942 --> 00:36.275
You and I...

00:36.277 --> 00:39.979
Have unfinished business,
old boy.

00:43.750 --> 00:46.552
"All debts paid in full."

00:46.554 --> 00:47.553
The Kellorem device.

00:47.555 --> 00:50.324
This is where I belong,
for the moment.

00:50.326 --> 00:52.661
There's just too much here
for us to ignore.

00:52.663 --> 00:54.830
It's a massive
time-dilation field.

00:54.832 --> 00:56.866
Something or someone

00:56.868 --> 00:58.670
is behind what happened
in Carentan.

00:58.672 --> 01:00.439
Adam Worth
and the time nodes.

01:00.441 --> 01:01.773
He died months ago
in Hollow Earth.

01:01.775 --> 01:03.508
What on Earth is it?

01:03.510 --> 01:05.043
We've just been
calling it a psych worm.

01:05.045 --> 01:06.379
The only
explanation

01:06.381 --> 01:08.048
is that it came
from Hollow Earth.

01:08.050 --> 01:09.983
We're getting reports
from Sanctuaries worldwide.

01:09.985 --> 01:11.985
We are on a full
global alert.

01:11.987 --> 01:13.954
Well, then,
we have to head home.

01:17.925 --> 01:19.126
When did this happen?

01:19.128 --> 01:20.594
Less than
half an hour ago.

01:20.596 --> 01:22.462
Rapid City dispatched
the National Guard,

01:22.464 --> 01:23.430
but they were
called off.

01:23.432 --> 01:24.364
By whom?

01:24.366 --> 01:25.599
Don't know.

01:25.601 --> 01:26.566
Satellite imagery
of the area

01:26.568 --> 01:27.501
has been blocked.

01:27.503 --> 01:28.702
Get Henry on it.

01:28.704 --> 01:29.937
He's already
in the lab.

01:29.939 --> 01:30.838
He's establishing
a video link

01:30.840 --> 01:32.508
with Dr. Lee at the U.N.

01:32.510 --> 01:35.044
Oh, bloody hell.

01:35.046 --> 01:36.613
How long, Henry?

01:36.615 --> 01:37.614
Coming online now.

01:38.650 --> 01:41.519
<i>Dr. Magnus,</i>
<i>Dr. Zimmerman.</i>

01:41.521 --> 01:43.054
<i>Good to see you again.</i>

01:43.056 --> 01:45.957
<i>This is General Villanova,</i>
<i>with the Lotus Defense Corps.</i>

01:45.959 --> 01:48.927
<i>General Villanova's men</i>
<i>were first on the scene.</i>

01:48.929 --> 01:51.664
<i>I've asked him to oversee</i>
<i>ground operations.</i>

01:51.666 --> 01:53.533
<i>My men have established</i>
<i>a three-mile perimeter</i>

01:53.535 --> 01:54.934
<i>and are clearing</i>
<i>the surrounding area</i>

01:54.936 --> 01:56.136
<i>of inhabitants.</i>

01:56.138 --> 01:57.370
<i>We've also scrambled</i>
<i>all communications</i>

01:57.372 --> 01:59.405
<i>and satellite transmissions.</i>

01:59.407 --> 02:00.673
Yes, I've noticed,

02:00.675 --> 02:03.843
but I need to understand
the full scope of the situation.

02:03.845 --> 02:05.712
<i>We're getting the first images</i>
<i>through now.</i>

02:05.714 --> 02:07.881

Dear God.

02:19.997 --> 02:21.197
Abnormals.

02:21.199 --> 02:23.099
Coming up from
Hollow Earth.

02:23.101 --> 02:25.936
I thought
they couldn't do that.

02:47.821 --> 02:49.187
<i>At this moment,</i>

02:49.189 --> 02:50.121
<i>we don't know</i>
<i>who these creatures are,</i>

02:50.123 --> 02:51.589
<i>or the threat they pose.</i>

02:51.591 --> 02:52.590
There's no reason
to suspect

02:52.592 --> 02:54.692
a sinister motive, General.

02:54.694 --> 02:55.994
Judging by the images,

02:55.996 --> 02:57.395
they're in need
of our help.

02:57.397 --> 02:58.730
<i>They've surfaced</i>

02:58.732 --> 03:00.499
<i>less than 60 miles</i>
<i>from a populated area.</i>

03:00.501 --> 03:01.866
<i>I'm requesting full authority</i>

03:01.868 --> 03:03.001
<i>to arrest and detain them</i>

03:03.003 --> 03:04.536
<i>by any means</i>
<i>necessary.</i>

03:04.538 --> 03:06.671
Whoa, just ease up
on the throttle there.

03:06.673 --> 03:07.839
With all due respect, General,

03:07.841 --> 03:09.808
this is not
your area of expertise.

03:09.810 --> 03:11.976
<i>And yet we were</i>
<i>the first responders.</i>

03:11.978 --> 03:14.446
That's because you jammed
all the signals from the region.

03:14.448 --> 03:15.514
You jumped the gun

03:15.516 --> 03:16.548
to deliberately
keep us in the dark.

03:16.550 --> 03:19.918
<i>Dr. Magnus,</i>
<i>what is your proposal?</i>

03:19.920 --> 03:22.521
Turn over the abnormals
to the Sanctuary.

03:22.523 --> 03:24.322
Give us full jurisdiction.

03:24.324 --> 03:26.424
<i>We've dealt with</i>
<i>this kind of situation before.</i>

03:26.426 --> 03:27.525
We know what we're doing.

03:27.527 --> 03:29.027
<i>Do you have facilities</i>
<i>large enough</i>

03:29.029 --> 03:30.361
<i>to house this many creatures?</i>

03:30.363 --> 03:31.696
Currently, no.

03:31.698 --> 03:34.766
But I do own a large vacant lot
not far from here.

03:34.768 --> 03:37.702
It's fenced in,
completely private.

03:37.704 --> 03:39.471
The abnormals will be safe

03:39.473 --> 03:42.440
until I can arrange for
more permanent accommodation.

03:42.442 --> 03:43.841
<i>Sounds lovely,</i>

03:43.843 --> 03:45.409
<i>but I'm concerned</i>
<i>about containment.</i>

03:45.411 --> 03:48.345
<i>My men currently have</i>
<i>the situation under control.</i>

03:48.347 --> 03:50.914
<i>Now, they can round up</i>
<i>the abnormals,</i>

03:50.916 --> 03:52.683
<i>convey them to your location,</i>

03:52.685 --> 03:54.385
<i>stay on and help run the camp.</i>

03:54.387 --> 03:56.487
That's very
considerate of you, General,

03:56.489 --> 03:57.622
but unnecessary.

03:57.624 --> 03:59.691
<i>Actually, I think</i>
<i>it's a good idea.</i>

03:59.693 --> 04:02.127
Oh, come on,
are you kidding me?

04:02.129 --> 04:03.562
<i>This is a highly volatile</i>
<i>situation,</i>

04:03.564 --> 04:04.797
<i>and we can't afford a repeat</i>

04:04.799 --> 04:06.833
<i>of the psych worm</i>
<i>incident.</i>

04:06.835 --> 04:08.034
<i>I see no harm</i>
<i>in working together.</i>

04:08.036 --> 04:09.202
But we--

04:09.204 --> 04:09.937
<i>I'll send</i>
<i>an advance team</i>

04:09.939 --> 04:11.438
<i>and arrange transport.</i>

04:11.440 --> 04:14.474
<i>You can expect the abnormals</i>
<i>by morning.</i>

04:14.476 --> 04:16.910
<i>Thank you, doctors.</i>

04:16.911 --> 04:19.680
<i>I appreciate your cooperation</i>
<i>with this matter, Dr. Magnus.</i>

04:19.682 --> 04:21.482
<i>I'll be in touch.</i>

04:22.718 --> 04:24.018
Uh, what the hell
just happened?

04:24.020 --> 04:26.054
The word "railroad"
comes to mind.

04:26.056 --> 04:28.389
Henry, contact the other
heads of Sanctuary,

04:28.391 --> 04:30.825
make them aware of
the situation.

04:30.827 --> 04:32.393
Try to figure out
why Ranna isn't responding.

04:32.395 --> 04:33.561
I need to understand
what the hell is happening.

04:33.563 --> 04:35.130
All right.

04:36.833 --> 04:37.900
And I'm...

04:37.902 --> 04:39.535
Going out and buying me
a vacant lot.

04:48.479 --> 04:50.914
These guys had
a busy morning.

04:53.885 --> 04:55.518
What'd this place
set us back?

04:55.520 --> 04:57.854
You don't want to know.

04:57.856 --> 04:59.055
Dr. Zimmerman?

04:59.057 --> 05:00.022
Yeah.

05:00.024 --> 05:00.923
Lt. Coxwell.

05:00.925 --> 05:02.024
Good to meet you.

05:02.026 --> 05:04.760
Not exactly as secure
as advertised.

05:04.762 --> 05:06.695
Well, we didn't have
a lot of time, so...

05:06.697 --> 05:09.531
Well, I've worked
with worse.

05:09.533 --> 05:10.565
Hey, what is this?

05:10.567 --> 05:11.733
Razor wire?

05:11.735 --> 05:12.801
Just a precaution.

05:12.803 --> 05:14.636
Jumpsuits?

05:14.638 --> 05:16.405
What kind of place
are you running here?

05:16.407 --> 05:17.673
I've been granted
authority

05:17.675 --> 05:20.009
to secure the camp
as I see fit.

05:20.011 --> 05:21.377
Hold on a second,

05:21.379 --> 05:23.546
these people have
come to us for help,

05:23.548 --> 05:25.181
and you're treating them
like criminals.

05:25.183 --> 05:27.184
As far as I'm concerned,
until we know differently,

05:27.186 --> 05:30.020
that's exactly what they are.

05:30.022 --> 05:31.022
Briggs, dammit!

05:31.024 --> 05:32.523
Get off your ass

05:32.525 --> 05:33.825
and move those
med supplies!

05:56.479 --> 05:58.680
What's the cover story?

05:58.682 --> 06:00.515
Army training
operation.

06:00.517 --> 06:01.716
All very Roswell.

06:01.718 --> 06:03.017
I've got a statement
from the chief of staff

06:03.019 --> 06:03.918
backing us up.

06:03.920 --> 06:05.086
He says hi.

06:05.088 --> 06:07.021
Nicely done.

06:07.023 --> 06:09.491
Doc, I understand
how important it is

06:09.493 --> 06:11.560
to protect what we do here,
but this last year,

06:11.562 --> 06:13.795
we've seen
some crazy stuff.

06:13.797 --> 06:16.064
I mean, there was the
pterodactyl over London,

06:16.066 --> 06:17.800
there was suki in Japan,

06:17.802 --> 06:18.967
not to mention
Big Bertha...

06:18.969 --> 06:19.869
Yeah, it's
getting harder

06:19.871 --> 06:22.171
to keep things
under wraps.

06:22.173 --> 06:23.806
Yeah, I mean,
that pterodactyl video

06:23.808 --> 06:25.074
showed up three times
on torrent sites

06:25.076 --> 06:27.077
before I was able to
corrupt it for good.

06:27.079 --> 06:28.612
It's starting
to go mainstream.

06:28.614 --> 06:29.780
Yeah, I've read
the reports.

06:29.782 --> 06:31.648
I'm not sure there's much
we can do about it.

06:31.650 --> 06:33.249
Yeah.

06:35.520 --> 06:36.753
Maybe we should
stop trying.

06:38.121 --> 06:39.188
I mean, this
latest situation

06:39.190 --> 06:41.056
could be an opportunity
to show the world

06:41.058 --> 06:43.159
what we do around here.

06:43.161 --> 06:45.894
Even so, I'm not sure
that the world is ready.

06:45.896 --> 06:48.029
Well, when will they be?

06:48.031 --> 06:50.932
I tried something
similar to this

06:50.934 --> 06:52.066
in the late 1940s.

06:52.068 --> 06:53.635
Henry, it did not go well.

06:53.637 --> 06:55.871
Opinions are still
the same as they were

06:55.873 --> 06:57.038
in the Dark Ages--

06:58.242 --> 07:00.609
So, in answer your question,
maybe never.

07:00.611 --> 07:03.212
Will, how's it going?

07:03.214 --> 07:04.247
What?

07:04.249 --> 07:06.816
A military camp?

07:06.818 --> 07:10.053
It's not that I object
to working with outsiders,

07:10.055 --> 07:13.190
it's just that this situation
is particularly sensitive.

07:13.192 --> 07:15.058
Not only do we need
to understand

07:15.060 --> 07:17.126
why more creatures are
coming out of Hollow Earth,

07:17.128 --> 07:19.195
but whatever we do here

07:19.197 --> 07:21.831
will set the precedent
for all future encounters.

07:21.833 --> 07:23.132
<i>Dr. Magnus,</i>
<i>I understand,</i>

07:23.134 --> 07:25.134
<i>but my hands are tied.</i>

07:25.136 --> 07:26.735
<i>In light of recent events,</i>

07:26.737 --> 07:30.038
<i>my superiors have established</i>
<i>a dedicated security force,</i>

07:30.040 --> 07:32.807
<i>one that deals with abnormals</i>

07:32.809 --> 07:33.908
<i>over and above</i>

07:33.910 --> 07:35.110
<i>the activities</i>
<i>of the Sanctuary.</i>

07:35.112 --> 07:36.044
Over and above?

07:36.046 --> 07:37.813
<i>Don't misunderstand--</i>

07:37.815 --> 07:39.715
<i>the Sanctuary still plays</i>
<i>a vital role,</i>

07:39.717 --> 07:41.951
<i>but the type of situation</i>
<i>we're encountering</i>

07:41.953 --> 07:44.187
<i>has grown more serious.</i>

07:44.189 --> 07:45.855
<i>Protecting abnormals</i>

07:45.857 --> 07:47.190
<i>is a noble endeavor,</i>

07:47.192 --> 07:49.159
<i>but we need to focus on</i>
<i>protecting ourselves.</i>

07:49.161 --> 07:50.427
Us vs. Them.

07:50.429 --> 07:53.264
That hasn't been the U.N.'s
policy on abnormals

07:53.266 --> 07:55.166
for decades.

07:55.168 --> 07:56.801
<i>We can revisit the issue</i>
<i>in the future,</i>

07:56.803 --> 07:57.802
<i>but for now,</i>

07:57.804 --> 07:59.604
<i>I'm afraid you have</i>
<i>no choice</i>

07:59.606 --> 08:01.839
<i>but to work with</i>
<i>General Villanova's men.</i>

08:01.841 --> 08:03.808
<i>How are the preparations going?</i>

08:03.810 --> 08:06.677
Two C-130s arrived an hour ago.

08:06.679 --> 08:08.345
Our guests
were loaded onto trucks

08:08.347 --> 08:10.047
and should be here any minute.

08:18.757 --> 08:20.925
Welcome, everyone!

08:20.927 --> 08:23.994
There's food
and blankets inside.

08:23.996 --> 08:25.095
I know you've had
a rough ride,

08:25.097 --> 08:27.631
but you're safe now.

08:37.039 --> 08:38.173
Hey, hey!

08:38.174 --> 08:40.041
Relax!

08:40.043 --> 08:41.876
Relax, he's a bryoscar.

08:41.878 --> 08:43.210
Water is toxic to him.

08:45.280 --> 08:47.247
It's okay.

08:47.249 --> 08:49.750
Let me take you inside.

09:11.141 --> 09:13.276
Excuse me, I'm sorry.
Sorry...

09:29.124 --> 09:30.023
Hey!

09:37.366 --> 09:40.068
Adam Worth stunned me
with an energy weapon

09:40.070 --> 09:42.771
and left me to be captured.

09:42.773 --> 09:45.441
My Senate allies and I
were convicted of treason,

09:45.443 --> 09:47.911
sentenced to death.

09:47.913 --> 09:49.479
So, how did
you escape?

09:49.481 --> 09:51.381
With the help of
other members of my tribe.

09:51.383 --> 09:53.684
I'd been living
in the Outlands

09:53.686 --> 09:54.751
ever since.

09:54.753 --> 09:58.422
What about your plans
to overthrow Praxis?

09:58.424 --> 10:00.023
Seize control
of the government?

10:00.025 --> 10:03.728
I figured I was lucky
just to be alive.

10:03.730 --> 10:05.763
Besides,

10:05.765 --> 10:09.166
Ranna's forces clamped down
on any opposition to the regime,

10:09.168 --> 10:11.402
imposed martial law.

10:11.404 --> 10:13.803
So why did you
come to the surface?

10:13.805 --> 10:15.405
You know of our
alliance with Ranna.

10:15.407 --> 10:17.007
We had no choice.

10:17.009 --> 10:20.277
We lost power to
our section of the tunnels.

10:20.279 --> 10:22.980
At first, I thought

10:22.982 --> 10:24.781
Ranna's forces
had tracked me down, but...

10:24.783 --> 10:26.850
no one came,

10:26.852 --> 10:28.753
and then the rumors began--

10:29.988 --> 10:31.422
that Praxis had been attacked.

10:31.424 --> 10:33.324
By whom?

10:33.326 --> 10:35.427
Truthfully,
I don't know.

10:35.429 --> 10:39.098
We waited as long as we could.

10:39.100 --> 10:40.900
The power from the city

10:40.902 --> 10:43.002
is what sustains
our water supply.

10:43.004 --> 10:45.138
Eventually,
the local tribes met,

10:45.140 --> 10:47.841
and we decided we would
take our chances on the surface.

10:54.149 --> 10:55.483
She said when they got
to the nearest gateway,

10:55.485 --> 10:57.217
the Praxian defenses were down.

10:57.219 --> 11:00.320
It would explain why
the psych worms escaped.

11:00.322 --> 11:01.988
<i>What does Ranna</i>
<i>say about it?</i>

11:01.990 --> 11:03.856
We haven't been able
to reach her.

11:03.858 --> 11:06.059
It's possible
she's got her hands full

11:06.061 --> 11:07.627
quelling the rebellion.

11:07.629 --> 11:10.196
Truthfully, I'm inclined
not to tell her about Fallon,

11:10.198 --> 11:13.366
given my experiences
with their judicial system.

11:13.368 --> 11:15.134
<i>What about their intentions</i>
<i>here on the surface?</i>

11:15.136 --> 11:18.271
All they want is
to resume their way of life.

11:18.273 --> 11:19.973
<i>Wishful thinking,</i>
<i>isn't it?</i>

11:21.342 --> 11:23.110
I suggested that her people
would be safer

11:23.112 --> 11:24.078
in the Sanctuaries,

11:24.080 --> 11:25.346
but she's not certain

11:25.348 --> 11:26.781
that she can convince
her tribe of it.

11:26.783 --> 11:28.083
<i>Well, tell them</i>
<i>they don't have a choice.</i>

11:28.085 --> 11:31.019
That's not how
the Sanctuary works, General.

11:31.021 --> 11:32.788
<i>What, you're just going</i>
<i>to let them leave?</i>

11:32.790 --> 11:34.189
<i>Give 'em</i>
<i>100 bucks each</i>

11:34.191 --> 11:35.223
<i>and turn 'em loose</i>
<i>in Times Square?</i>

11:35.225 --> 11:36.524
Of course not.

11:36.526 --> 11:39.261
We work with them,
help them to adjust.

11:39.263 --> 11:41.796
<i>They can never adjust.</i>
<i>They're abnormals.</i>

11:41.798 --> 11:44.333
Meaning what,
they have no rights?

11:44.335 --> 11:45.534
<i> Doc,</i>
<i>I need you up here.</i>

11:45.536 --> 11:48.136
I'm a little busy
right now.

11:48.138 --> 11:50.806
<i>Uh, you need to get</i>
<i>un-busy.</i>

11:52.375 --> 11:53.975
What's this about, Henry?

11:53.977 --> 11:55.076
Did you hear
from Ranna?

11:55.078 --> 11:57.211
Uh, no, she's still
not answering.

11:57.213 --> 11:59.413
Well, what is it, then?

11:59.415 --> 12:01.849
Um...

12:06.387 --> 12:07.420
John.

12:10.223 --> 12:13.325
Adam's alive.

12:13.327 --> 12:15.027
We're all in grave danger.

12:18.170 --> 12:19.937
Here you go.

12:20.622 --> 12:22.121
Take it.

12:26.362 --> 12:27.395
What is the deal?

12:27.397 --> 12:28.697
My water's not
good enough?

12:28.699 --> 12:31.066
It's that old
furry charm, I guess.

12:31.068 --> 12:32.567
No, seriously.

12:32.569 --> 12:34.202
It's like I have
horns or something.

12:34.204 --> 12:37.039
That'd help.

12:37.041 --> 12:38.340
Come on, Kate,
look around you.

12:38.342 --> 12:39.608
Everyone here's
an abnormal.

12:39.610 --> 12:44.079
To them, you're
the strange one.

12:46.183 --> 12:48.484
They've been
treated well here.

12:54.158 --> 12:57.194
These are beautiful.

12:59.698 --> 13:01.632
May I?

13:02.634 --> 13:04.335
Sure.

13:08.039 --> 13:09.306
It's pallo stone
from my village.

13:10.375 --> 13:12.142
They say it matches our eyes,

13:12.144 --> 13:13.477
but I think
it's to help with sales.

13:15.114 --> 13:16.146
I brought

13:16.148 --> 13:18.248
as much as I could carry.

13:18.250 --> 13:20.450
It's hard to believe
it's all I have left.

13:22.186 --> 13:23.220
I'm sorry.

13:24.489 --> 13:26.223
Oh, no, no,
you should keep it.

13:26.225 --> 13:28.492
No, no, I couldn't.

13:28.494 --> 13:30.394
Please, they're
meant to be worn.

13:30.396 --> 13:32.130
Here...

13:32.132 --> 13:33.598
Let me put it on you.

13:42.343 --> 13:43.176
Thank you.

13:44.279 --> 13:45.379
I'm Garris.

13:45.381 --> 13:46.347
Kate...

13:46.349 --> 13:48.082
Kate.

13:49.484 --> 13:51.084
It looks lovely, Kate.

14:07.735 --> 14:09.202
Explain yourself.

14:09.204 --> 14:10.770
I saw Adam
a few days ago.

14:10.772 --> 14:12.271
How is that possible?

14:12.273 --> 14:14.039
The last time
I saw him...

14:14.041 --> 14:16.508
He was getting away
with the Kellorem device.

14:29.321 --> 14:31.455
You and I...

14:31.457 --> 14:33.057
have unfinished business,
old boy.

14:33.059 --> 14:35.226
John, wait.

14:35.228 --> 14:36.360
Listen to me.

14:37.662 --> 14:39.196
I think you've said
quite enough.

14:39.198 --> 14:42.365
You don't understand
what this device is capable of.

14:42.367 --> 14:43.500
I've given it
some thought,

14:43.502 --> 14:47.403
and it turns out I don't care!

14:47.405 --> 14:48.672
But you do care, John.

14:48.674 --> 14:51.107
You care deeply.

14:51.109 --> 14:52.808
That's what makes
you and I the same.

14:52.810 --> 14:54.143
Ah...

14:54.145 --> 14:55.644
Now, if you're trying
to provoke me

14:55.646 --> 14:57.112
so I'll kill you more quickly...

14:57.114 --> 14:59.681
I can give you everything,
everything you've ever wanted.

14:59.683 --> 15:02.283
Aye...

15:02.285 --> 15:05.286
You kill me now,
you lose that chance.

15:05.288 --> 15:06.354
Oh, really?

15:09.192 --> 15:11.859
We had a deal before,
you and I.

15:11.861 --> 15:15.563
That one worked out
well for you, right?

15:15.565 --> 15:18.199
Didn't it?

15:18.201 --> 15:22.871
Oh, Adam...

15:22.873 --> 15:25.607
This is most entertaining.

15:25.609 --> 15:27.376
He told me he intended
to use the device

15:27.378 --> 15:28.444
to save his daughter.

15:28.446 --> 15:29.712
Imogen?

15:29.714 --> 15:31.447
She died over
a hundred years ago.

15:31.449 --> 15:32.882
Exactly.

15:34.718 --> 15:36.720
Time travel?

15:36.722 --> 15:37.688
It's impossible.

15:37.690 --> 15:38.722
That's what I said.

15:38.724 --> 15:40.858
I told him he was mad,

15:40.860 --> 15:43.461
but he said he'd found a way.

15:43.463 --> 15:46.631
That he had a cure,
a Praxian cure for her disease.

15:46.633 --> 15:49.167
What difference
would that make?

15:50.903 --> 15:52.670
And why would you
allow him to live?

15:54.306 --> 15:55.874
He promised
to take me with him,

15:55.876 --> 15:58.510
back to Oxford.

15:58.512 --> 16:00.912
Before...

16:00.914 --> 16:03.315
Before we injected
the source blood.

16:04.918 --> 16:06.819
Why would you
want to do that?

16:06.821 --> 16:07.887
You know why.

16:07.889 --> 16:10.356
If I could have prevented us

16:10.358 --> 16:11.758
from taking
that damnable blood,

16:11.760 --> 16:14.360
things would have
been so different.

16:14.362 --> 16:17.464
You and I
could have been together,

16:17.466 --> 16:19.333
raised children.

16:21.769 --> 16:23.904
Why would you think...

16:25.407 --> 16:27.340
You would have been altering
the course of history.

16:27.342 --> 16:29.376
That was the point.

16:31.612 --> 16:35.181
But Adam's blood
inside the module...

16:35.183 --> 16:36.616
You sent back
the Kellorem device.

16:36.618 --> 16:40.653
After he copied down
its specifications.

16:40.655 --> 16:42.321
He used time nodes
to allow himself to finish.

16:43.857 --> 16:47.259
We needed to prevent you
from looking for us.

16:47.261 --> 16:49.429
And where is Adam now?

16:51.898 --> 16:53.366
He disappeared.

16:54.801 --> 16:57.937
He had no intention
of honoring his word.

16:57.939 --> 17:00.940
So now you've come to me
for help.

17:02.876 --> 17:03.776
Yes.

17:06.012 --> 17:07.445
Are you serious?

17:07.448 --> 17:09.214
If Adam succeeds in
altering the timeline,

17:09.217 --> 17:10.648
then everything
about our world,

17:10.651 --> 17:11.951
the refugees,
the Sanctuary,

17:11.953 --> 17:12.952
our very lives--

17:12.954 --> 17:14.920
will be irreparably
damaged.

17:14.922 --> 17:16.589
We may even
cease to exist.

17:16.590 --> 17:17.557
The butterfly effect.

17:17.559 --> 17:18.657
It'll be like
Carentan over again.

17:18.660 --> 17:20.627
Except on a much
larger scale,

17:20.628 --> 17:22.194
and with a copy
of the Kellorem device,

17:22.196 --> 17:24.529
Adam has all the power
he needs to carry it out.

17:24.531 --> 17:25.730
Okay, I get it,

17:25.732 --> 17:28.333
but what about Lee
and villanova?

17:28.335 --> 17:29.434
They aren't going
to be too thrilled

17:29.436 --> 17:31.503
when they find out
you're gone.

17:32.640 --> 17:34.039
You'll have to explain
my absence somehow,

17:34.041 --> 17:35.841
but leave Adam
out of it.

17:35.843 --> 17:37.943
There's no sense
spreading panic.

17:40.747 --> 17:43.015
I'll be in touch
as soon as I can.

17:44.483 --> 17:46.718
Shall we?

17:56.527 --> 17:58.295
Thelo,
be reasonable.

17:58.297 --> 17:59.462
Reasonable?

17:59.464 --> 18:01.264
They're talking about
confinement.

18:01.266 --> 18:02.432
It's for our own safety.

18:02.434 --> 18:04.267
We can take care of ourselves.

18:04.269 --> 18:05.868
Things are different up here.

18:05.870 --> 18:08.304
The humans know nothing
of the existence of our kind.

18:08.306 --> 18:09.772
Then maybe it's time
they were told.

18:09.774 --> 18:11.941
We can't upset
the balance of power.

18:11.943 --> 18:12.842
We decided
to come here.

18:12.844 --> 18:14.745
This is their land.

18:14.747 --> 18:17.515
Now you sound
just like a Praxian.

18:19.284 --> 18:22.053
I will need your voice
to convince the others.

18:22.055 --> 18:23.288
Will I have it?

18:24.690 --> 18:27.660
You know the surface-dwellers
better than I.

18:27.662 --> 18:28.861
I won't stand in your way.

18:34.767 --> 18:36.601
I said I was sorry.

18:36.603 --> 18:38.336
And that's supposed to
make it okay?

18:38.338 --> 18:39.604
You put the lives
of billions of people

18:39.606 --> 18:40.638
at risk.

18:40.640 --> 18:41.706
Well, I was
following my heart.

18:41.708 --> 18:42.740
Your heart?

18:42.742 --> 18:43.808
John, when are you
going to get over

18:43.810 --> 18:45.109
this foolish obsession?

18:45.111 --> 18:46.377
Trying to force us
together.

18:46.379 --> 18:47.811
You've been at it for
over a hundred years.

18:47.813 --> 18:49.346
It hasn't always
been one-sided.

18:49.348 --> 18:51.081
We are not meant
to be together.

18:51.083 --> 18:52.316
You do not
believe that.

18:52.318 --> 18:53.451
I do.

18:53.453 --> 18:56.554
We've never been able
to make it work, ever,

18:56.556 --> 18:59.023
and when this is over,
I don't want to see you again.

19:02.362 --> 19:03.562
All this

19:03.564 --> 19:05.397
because I didn't
kill Worth for you.

19:05.399 --> 19:06.565
How hypocritical.

19:06.567 --> 19:07.566
What?

19:07.568 --> 19:08.834
You claim to revile
my bloodlust

19:08.836 --> 19:10.369
until you need it.

19:10.371 --> 19:11.637
Then you're
more than happy

19:11.639 --> 19:13.438
for me to step in and do
all your dirty work.

19:13.440 --> 19:15.574
If I'd been inside
that transport module,

19:15.576 --> 19:16.841
I'd have taken care
of things myself,

19:16.843 --> 19:18.743
thank you.

19:18.745 --> 19:20.011
In any case,

19:20.013 --> 19:21.079
I wouldn't have been
taken in by his lies.

19:21.081 --> 19:23.914
How could you think
that rewriting the past

19:23.916 --> 19:25.582
was any kind of
solution?

19:25.584 --> 19:27.718
You'd really wipe out
the last hundred years

19:27.720 --> 19:28.685
without so much
as a second thought?

19:30.555 --> 19:32.456
To be with you?
Oh, yes.

19:33.658 --> 19:36.960
If who I am now
is so meaningless to you

19:36.962 --> 19:38.495
that you would sacrifice it

19:38.497 --> 19:39.630
in order to bed me

19:39.632 --> 19:41.565
in some other
timeline?

19:41.567 --> 19:43.000
John...

19:43.002 --> 19:46.136
That's not love.

19:56.615 --> 19:58.382
Hi.

19:59.818 --> 20:02.019
I got a present
for you.

20:08.459 --> 20:09.559
It's azurite.

20:10.861 --> 20:12.495
Um, it's not
the same as yours,

20:12.497 --> 20:13.462
but I figured

20:13.464 --> 20:14.730
it would keep you
busy for a while.

20:16.466 --> 20:19.501
I can't believe
you'd do this for me.

20:19.503 --> 20:21.003
Well, it's nothing.

20:21.005 --> 20:22.037
We keep geological samples

20:22.039 --> 20:23.572
on hand in the Sanctuary

20:23.574 --> 20:26.775
for habitat building
and stuff, so...

20:28.845 --> 20:30.079
Leave it to you

20:30.081 --> 20:33.015
to find a cozy <i> seeth</i>
<i>on your first day here.</i>

20:33.017 --> 20:34.517
What did you
call her?

20:34.519 --> 20:35.751
You heard me.

20:35.753 --> 20:36.652
It's okay.

20:36.654 --> 20:37.720
I don't even know
what that means.

20:37.722 --> 20:40.056
No, but he does,

20:40.058 --> 20:42.792
and he should
know better.

20:42.794 --> 20:44.427
Guys, I don't think
this is a good idea.

20:46.631 --> 20:47.964
Crap!

20:47.966 --> 20:50.165
<i>Dr. Zimmerman,</i>
<i>where is Dr. Magnus?</i>

20:50.167 --> 20:52.968
She's working on
something right now.

20:52.970 --> 20:54.737
<i>What could possibly be</i>
<i>more important than this?</i>

20:54.739 --> 20:55.971
An incident has come up

20:55.973 --> 20:57.606
that has far-reaching
ramifications

20:57.608 --> 20:59.107
on the current situation.

20:59.109 --> 21:00.442
It's time-sensitive

21:00.444 --> 21:02.945
and something that only
Magnus herself can deal with.

21:02.947 --> 21:05.681
<i>I need you</i>
<i>to get her back now,</i>

21:05.683 --> 21:07.716
<i>or I'll have no option</i>

21:07.718 --> 21:09.886
<i>than to put</i>
<i>General Villanova</i>

21:09.888 --> 21:11.187
<i>exclusively in charge</i>
<i>of the refugees' care.</i>

21:11.189 --> 21:12.521
That won't be necessary.

21:12.523 --> 21:14.557
The Sanctuary has
everything in hand.

21:17.060 --> 21:18.093
<i>Dr. Zimmerman!</i>

21:18.095 --> 21:19.995
Uh, I-I gotta go.

21:21.631 --> 21:25.968
This tunnel comes out
just above the city.

21:25.970 --> 21:27.169
Shouldn't we have
encountered

21:27.171 --> 21:28.503
a perimeter
Garrison by now?

21:28.505 --> 21:29.638
Yes, it is odd.

21:29.640 --> 21:31.039
Come to think of it,

21:31.041 --> 21:32.808
I haven't seen anyone
since we got down here.

21:32.810 --> 21:33.975
Where is everybody?

21:38.948 --> 21:39.848
Praxis...

21:45.987 --> 21:48.155
It's gone.

21:54.607 --> 21:56.174
What happened here?

21:56.176 --> 21:57.142
Worth.

21:57.144 --> 21:58.077
He must have made
another attempt

21:58.079 --> 22:00.079
to power up the machine.

22:00.081 --> 22:03.183
Another attempt?

22:04.243 --> 22:05.304
Carentan.

22:05.346 --> 22:06.812
It was his first experiment.

22:08.166 --> 22:11.700
The machine overloaded,
a time bubble escaped,

22:11.702 --> 22:13.168
traveled up a fissure
in the Earth.

22:13.170 --> 22:15.237
A fissure created
by the fire elemental I buried

22:15.239 --> 22:16.371
in 1944.

22:23.146 --> 22:25.180
All these people.

22:25.182 --> 22:28.017
The technology,
the advancements...

22:29.719 --> 22:31.653
We have to warn Henry and Will.

22:31.655 --> 22:34.723
With Praxis no longer
in control down here,

22:34.725 --> 22:35.991
there's nothing
to stop

22:35.993 --> 22:37.026
the tide of
Hollow Earth abnormals

22:37.028 --> 22:39.263
from breaching
the surface.

22:39.265 --> 22:43.300
These were Ranna's chambers.

22:50.276 --> 22:52.176
Helen...

22:55.214 --> 22:57.082
My father's walking stick.

22:57.084 --> 22:58.683
I'm so sorry, Helen.

23:01.720 --> 23:03.422
We have to find Adam Worth,

23:03.424 --> 23:05.423
stop him before he does
any more damage.

23:05.425 --> 23:07.993
His lab is back in the tunnels.

23:07.995 --> 23:09.127
It was--

23:10.997 --> 23:13.165
the last place I saw him.

23:26.445 --> 23:27.712
What happened?

23:27.714 --> 23:28.913
Couple guys
got into a fight.

23:28.915 --> 23:30.382
Things got a little,
uh, out of control.

23:30.384 --> 23:32.984
I'll say.
What was it about?

23:32.986 --> 23:34.252
Me.

23:34.254 --> 23:35.320
I was hanging with
one of the abnormals--

23:35.322 --> 23:36.488
Garris--

23:36.490 --> 23:37.188
and someone
made a crack.

23:37.190 --> 23:38.423
And that led to this?

23:38.425 --> 23:40.826
Yeah, it did seem
to escalate

23:40.828 --> 23:42.193
awful quick.

23:42.195 --> 23:43.061
Did you get a look
at the guys who started it,

23:43.063 --> 23:43.895
or where they went?

23:43.897 --> 23:45.363
They're in a tent.

23:45.365 --> 23:46.698
This way.

23:48.901 --> 23:50.101
You see the way they treat us?

23:50.103 --> 23:53.738
Like beasts,
whipping us into submission.

23:53.740 --> 23:57.341
Fallon believes that
we should bow down to them,

23:57.343 --> 23:59.877
spend the rest of our lives
in a prison.

23:59.879 --> 24:03.781
Well, I for one
am not willing to do that.

24:03.783 --> 24:05.082
If we're not careful,

24:05.084 --> 24:06.951
she'll sell us out
for her own gain.

24:06.953 --> 24:11.289
Once a Praxian,
always a Praxian!

24:15.228 --> 24:17.229
What do we do?

24:17.231 --> 24:18.330
Tell lt. Coxwell?

24:18.332 --> 24:21.467
Might make
matters worse.

24:21.469 --> 24:23.236
Let me talk
to Fallon first.

24:23.238 --> 24:25.138
Yeah, and I gotta
find Garris.

24:26.441 --> 24:28.442
It's just up ahead.

24:33.514 --> 24:35.749
Still no sign of him.

24:35.751 --> 24:37.251
Is there anywhere
else he could be?

24:37.253 --> 24:40.520
I searched everywhere
before coming to you.

24:45.426 --> 24:48.394
Some of his systems
are still online.

24:59.174 --> 25:00.441
What are you doing?

25:00.443 --> 25:01.943
There might be
some information on here

25:01.945 --> 25:03.011
about Adam's machine.

25:03.013 --> 25:05.581
Specs,
energy signatures,

25:05.583 --> 25:06.915
anything Henry
might be able to use

25:06.917 --> 25:08.150
to help us find him.

25:08.152 --> 25:10.319
Let's see
what we can download.

25:14.859 --> 25:17.293
Garris...

25:20.264 --> 25:23.066
I looked for you
in the infirmary.

25:24.303 --> 25:26.469
I am so sorry
for what happened.

25:26.471 --> 25:29.439
It wasn't your fault.

25:29.441 --> 25:31.308
Are you okay?

25:31.310 --> 25:32.509
I'm fine.

25:32.511 --> 25:36.179
You shouldn't
trouble yourself.

25:36.181 --> 25:39.049
It's no trouble.

25:42.220 --> 25:44.989
Okay, then.

25:44.991 --> 25:46.458
It's better

25:46.460 --> 25:49.995
that you and I
are not seen together.

25:49.997 --> 25:51.529
Why, 'cause of them?

25:51.531 --> 25:52.597
No.

25:52.599 --> 25:54.431
It has nothing
to do with that.

25:54.433 --> 25:57.300
Then what?

25:57.302 --> 26:00.870
Tell me,
what's going on?

26:00.872 --> 26:02.872
Nothing.

26:02.874 --> 26:04.574
You should go.

26:13.284 --> 26:14.249
Right.

26:15.351 --> 26:17.453
Take this to the surface.

26:17.455 --> 26:19.188
Warn them about Praxis.

26:19.190 --> 26:20.890
I'll go through Adam's logs,

26:20.892 --> 26:22.392
see if there's any indication
of other hideouts

26:22.394 --> 26:23.393
he might be using--

26:23.395 --> 26:24.228
I'm not leaving you
here all alone.

26:24.230 --> 26:25.629
It'll take too long

26:25.631 --> 26:27.197
to get to a place
where I can teleport from.

26:27.199 --> 26:30.034
If Adam comes back,
I'll be ready.

26:30.036 --> 26:31.135
Go.

26:38.442 --> 26:40.410
Fallon?

26:40.412 --> 26:43.246
Hey, it's me.

26:46.884 --> 26:48.484
Oh no...

26:48.486 --> 26:50.119
Oh, my God.

26:58.628 --> 27:00.262
Go get the others.

27:00.264 --> 27:01.230
Whoa, whoa,
hold on.

27:01.232 --> 27:02.898
This isn't what it looks like.

27:02.900 --> 27:04.399
What have you done?

27:05.501 --> 27:07.068
Nothing!
I-I found her this way.

27:09.273 --> 27:10.439
Come on...

27:10.441 --> 27:12.975
Just h-hold on a second.

27:17.670 --> 27:18.736
Really?

27:18.738 --> 27:21.105
Really, you want to...

27:53.035 --> 27:54.602
He's trapped!

28:00.976 --> 28:02.577
Okay...

28:02.579 --> 28:04.479
Okay, you want
to do this?

28:04.481 --> 28:05.413
Okay.

28:22.699 --> 28:23.698
Get up!

28:44.450 --> 28:46.350
Come on, get up!

28:50.421 --> 28:52.990
Come on. Come on.

29:02.500 --> 29:04.701
No, no, no,
I got it, I got it--

29:04.703 --> 29:05.502
Go find Kate!

29:18.451 --> 29:19.284
No!

29:19.286 --> 29:20.152
Keep moving!

29:20.154 --> 29:21.753
What about Kate?

29:21.755 --> 29:23.221
My men
will find her.

29:30.062 --> 29:31.095
Here we are.

30:00.556 --> 30:02.257
Dude, Lee and Villanova
are screaming--

30:02.259 --> 30:03.592
yeah, of course
they are.

30:03.594 --> 30:04.793
Any word from
Kate or Biggie?

30:04.795 --> 30:05.827
No.

30:05.829 --> 30:07.128
What about
the cellphone?

30:07.130 --> 30:08.329
No, all signals
are blocked,

30:08.331 --> 30:09.597
no communication
in or out.

30:09.599 --> 30:12.134
We have no idea
where they are.

30:12.136 --> 30:13.735
Dammit.

30:13.737 --> 30:16.838
We have other
problems, Will.

30:16.840 --> 30:19.407
Magnus sent Druitt back.

30:19.409 --> 30:20.509
Praxis is gone.

30:20.511 --> 30:22.177
Gone?

30:22.179 --> 30:23.245
What do you mean, "gone"?

30:23.247 --> 30:24.079
It's gone.

30:24.081 --> 30:25.815
Leveled, destroyed.

30:25.817 --> 30:27.483
Apparently the machine
Worth is building

30:27.485 --> 30:29.002
has ugly side effects.

30:30.388 --> 30:31.655
Son of a bitch.

30:31.657 --> 30:33.490
Yeah.

30:33.492 --> 30:35.459
He gave me a data drive
from Worth's computer.

30:35.461 --> 30:36.494
And what's on it?

30:36.496 --> 30:38.229
I'm still working on that.

30:38.231 --> 30:39.497
But Worth knew

30:39.499 --> 30:41.365
what his machine
would do to Praxis,

30:41.367 --> 30:43.100
and Carentan.

30:46.437 --> 30:47.705
All right.

30:47.707 --> 30:50.107
You ready to talk to them?

30:51.843 --> 30:53.678
Yeah.

30:59.517 --> 31:00.517
<i>Dr. Zimmerman.</i>

31:00.519 --> 31:01.752
<i>What's going on</i>
<i>in there?</i>

31:01.754 --> 31:03.187
I went to meet with Fallon.

31:03.189 --> 31:04.288
She was dead.

31:04.290 --> 31:05.822
Thelo, one of
the other leaders,

31:05.824 --> 31:06.923
found me standing over her.

31:06.925 --> 31:07.691
That's what started
this chaos.

31:07.693 --> 31:09.293
<i>My God...</i>

31:09.295 --> 31:10.561
<i>Why</i>
<i>were you in there</i>

31:10.563 --> 31:11.361
<i>without</i>
<i>an armed escort?</i>

31:11.363 --> 31:12.329
Aw,
give me a break.

31:12.331 --> 31:13.730
We're not at war.

31:13.732 --> 31:15.065
These aren't
enemy combatants.

31:15.067 --> 31:16.566
<i>Looks pretty</i>
<i>combative to me.</i>

31:17.768 --> 31:19.670
You're missing
the point.

31:19.672 --> 31:21.505
I was set up.

31:21.507 --> 31:22.807
<i>By whom?</i>

31:22.809 --> 31:24.575
Thelo, I think.

31:24.577 --> 31:25.677
I overheard him
badmouthing Fallon

31:25.679 --> 31:26.778
to some of
the other abnormals.

31:26.780 --> 31:27.979
<i>When did this</i>
<i>happen?</i>

31:27.981 --> 31:29.515
<i>Why didn't you</i>
<i>talk to me?</i>

31:29.517 --> 31:32.284
I wanted to talk to Fallon
before telling your men.

31:32.286 --> 31:33.586
<i>Why would Thelo</i>
<i>want to frame you?</i>

31:33.588 --> 31:35.021
I don't know,

31:35.023 --> 31:37.457
but there's definitely
something else going on here.

31:39.694 --> 31:40.826
What happened?

31:40.828 --> 31:42.428
We just lost the security feed

31:42.430 --> 31:43.529
from the camp.

32:00.914 --> 32:03.282
Adam?

32:37.986 --> 32:39.386
What the hell?

32:39.388 --> 32:41.856
Are you getting this?

32:41.858 --> 32:43.391
<i>That's</i>
<i>our command tent!</i>

32:43.393 --> 32:44.292
<i>I know you can hear me.</i>

32:45.428 --> 32:46.928
<i>We have seized control</i>
<i>of the camp.</i>

32:46.930 --> 32:49.799
<i>Our demands</i>
<i>are simple.</i>

32:49.801 --> 32:52.368
<i>We want the same rights</i>
<i>and freedoms as you do.</i>

32:52.370 --> 32:53.804
<i>Since we can't</i>
<i>return home,</i>

32:53.806 --> 32:56.006
<i>we require our own</i>
<i>independent state,</i>

32:56.008 --> 32:58.642
<i>free to resume</i>
<i>our way of life.</i>

32:58.644 --> 33:00.611
<i>We do not seek bloodshed,</i>

33:00.613 --> 33:02.613
<i>but if our demands</i>
<i>are not met,</i>

33:02.615 --> 33:06.483
<i>we will not hesitate</i>
<i>to do whatever is necessary.</i>

33:24.737 --> 33:27.606
<i>You have two hours</i>
<i>to make arrangements.</i>

33:27.608 --> 33:28.907
<i>After that,</i>

33:28.909 --> 33:30.842
<i>we kill our first hostage.</i>

33:32.846 --> 33:35.715
Will, Kate's
still in there too.

33:40.520 --> 33:41.587
Adam?

33:41.589 --> 33:42.621
Helen?

33:42.623 --> 33:44.823
What's wrong?

33:46.426 --> 33:48.426
Quiet.

33:50.363 --> 33:51.630
Adam...

34:03.009 --> 34:04.843
He's not in hiding.

34:04.845 --> 34:06.412
He's here.

34:08.341 --> 34:09.174
He's been hiding
in plain sight

34:09.176 --> 34:10.574
the entire time!

34:10.577 --> 34:13.679
Which means he hasn't
finished his work.

34:13.681 --> 34:15.047
How do we get to him?

34:15.049 --> 34:17.183
Power.

34:17.185 --> 34:19.452
He must be using
an external energy source

34:19.454 --> 34:21.221
to generate the rift field.

34:21.223 --> 34:23.257
That's why the lights
keep flickering.

34:23.259 --> 34:24.958
Wouldn't he use
the Kellorem device?

34:24.960 --> 34:26.560
No.

34:26.562 --> 34:28.362
I suspect he needs that
to power his time device.

34:28.364 --> 34:30.699
This is localized power,

34:30.701 --> 34:34.136
likely drawn from
the geothermal systems.

34:34.138 --> 34:36.670
Now, I was able to partially
disrupt the rift field

34:36.672 --> 34:38.706
by manipulating
these machines.

34:38.708 --> 34:40.674
We need to siphon more power

34:40.676 --> 34:43.143
in order to force him
out into the open.

34:48.014 --> 34:49.547
<i>Dr. Lee,</i>

34:49.550 --> 34:51.717
<i>I need your permission</i>
<i>to assemble a strike team.</i>

34:51.719 --> 34:54.186
<i>It's our best chance</i>
<i>of minimizing casualties.</i>

34:54.188 --> 34:55.655
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

34:55.657 --> 34:58.224
all that will do
is inflame the situation.

34:58.226 --> 35:00.126
Our best hope
is to open up communication

35:00.128 --> 35:01.261
and hope they back down.

35:01.263 --> 35:03.530
<i>Son, the situation</i>
<i>has changed,</i>

35:03.532 --> 35:05.032
<i>and this time,</i>

35:05.034 --> 35:06.133
<i>you're way out of</i>
<i>your league.</i>

35:06.135 --> 35:07.401
<i>Doctor?</i>

35:07.403 --> 35:08.769
<i>Go ahead.</i>

35:08.771 --> 35:10.171
Oh, come on,
you can't be serious!

35:10.173 --> 35:12.307
<i>I need to contact</i>
<i>my superiors.</i>

35:12.309 --> 35:13.542
Dr. Lee,
just wait a second--

35:13.544 --> 35:16.444
<i>enough! There are</i>
<i>hostages, Dr. Zimmerman.</i>

35:16.446 --> 35:18.579
<i>This has gone far beyond</i>
<i>a Sanctuary matter.</i>

35:18.581 --> 35:20.548
Okay, fine, but
we have two hours.

35:20.550 --> 35:23.217
All I'm asking is that
you don't attack the camp

35:23.219 --> 35:24.685
until it's absolutely necessary.

35:26.587 --> 35:29.122
I'll give you half that time.

35:34.495 --> 35:37.163
How did this spiral
out of control so quickly?

35:37.165 --> 35:38.599
It's almost like
it was planned all along.

35:38.601 --> 35:39.633
Well, it's a horrible plan.

35:39.635 --> 35:41.302
Come on, taking hostages?

35:41.304 --> 35:43.471
That's not a good way to bring
attention to your cause.

35:45.341 --> 35:47.442
Maybe that's the point.

35:47.444 --> 35:49.744
What's the point?

35:49.746 --> 35:53.048
What if it's not about
the cause?

35:53.050 --> 35:55.584
What if it's about attention,
drawing attention?

35:55.586 --> 35:56.485
It's a diversion.

35:56.487 --> 35:57.853
Yeah.

35:57.855 --> 35:58.654
To get the entire
Sanctuary network

35:58.656 --> 36:00.789
to focus on the wrong thing.

36:00.791 --> 36:03.258
Okay... okay, so,
what's the right thing?

36:03.260 --> 36:04.593
I don't know,

36:04.595 --> 36:05.760
but it's got to have
something to do

36:05.762 --> 36:06.995
with Worth's weapon.

36:06.997 --> 36:09.064
The timing
is way too coincidental.

36:09.066 --> 36:10.465
The data Magnus sent.

36:10.467 --> 36:11.700
There's got to be a connection
in there somewhere.

36:11.702 --> 36:14.469
Yeah.

36:14.471 --> 36:16.137
I managed to override
the safety protocols

36:16.139 --> 36:17.471
on these devices.

36:17.473 --> 36:19.140
If we draw maximum power,

36:19.142 --> 36:20.642
we should be able
to weaken his rift field.

36:20.644 --> 36:22.377
And if he compensates?

36:22.379 --> 36:24.812
Let's hope he can't.

36:29.518 --> 36:31.053
Well...

36:31.055 --> 36:33.089
If it isn't my favorite
dysfunctional couple.

36:35.259 --> 36:36.793
Damn.

36:36.795 --> 36:38.561
It's not drawing enough power
to collapse the field.

36:38.563 --> 36:40.263
Adam, stop this.

36:40.265 --> 36:41.798
Oh, Johnny...

36:41.800 --> 36:44.301
Still feeling bitter
about not coming along?

36:44.303 --> 36:46.137
Adam, what are you doing?
This is madness.

36:46.139 --> 36:47.539
Says you.

36:47.541 --> 36:50.742
After I get this up and running,
I'll be off to the races.

36:50.744 --> 36:53.212
Amazing,
that Praxian technology.

36:53.214 --> 36:55.281
But you'll destroy everything.

36:55.283 --> 36:57.683
Billions of lives wiped out.

36:57.685 --> 36:59.351
Their blood on your hands.

36:59.353 --> 37:01.487
What's so special
about their blood?

37:01.489 --> 37:03.255
I have a chance

37:03.257 --> 37:04.656
to get my daughter back.

37:04.658 --> 37:06.558
Are you telling me
you wouldn't do the same thing?

37:06.560 --> 37:08.760
Not at the expense
of everyone on the planet.

37:08.762 --> 37:12.264
Oh, you always were
a bit of bore, Helen.

37:12.266 --> 37:13.832
Even your boyfriend
wanted a do-over,

37:13.834 --> 37:15.768
till he found we were going
to the wrong time.

37:15.770 --> 37:16.936
What are you
talking about?

37:16.938 --> 37:17.903
Adam...

37:17.905 --> 37:19.372
Oh.

37:19.374 --> 37:20.806
He hasn't told you
the whole story,

37:20.808 --> 37:22.441
has he?

37:22.443 --> 37:23.609
No, of course not.

37:23.611 --> 37:25.445
Secrets and lies...

37:25.447 --> 37:27.213
You see,

37:27.215 --> 37:28.648
John wanted to go back to 1886,

37:28.650 --> 37:29.749
before the whole

37:29.751 --> 37:31.017
source blood
incident happened.

37:31.019 --> 37:32.352
But you realized
you couldn't do that.

37:32.354 --> 37:34.387
She is a smart one, John.

37:35.756 --> 37:37.056
Going back to 1886

37:37.058 --> 37:38.090
would have altered
the timeline.

37:38.092 --> 37:39.825
There's no telling what
it would have done

37:39.827 --> 37:42.328
to the future,
even the near future.

37:42.330 --> 37:44.497
Your daughter may never
have been born.

37:44.499 --> 37:47.967
Mmm, and since this is most
definitely a one-shot deal...

37:47.969 --> 37:49.402
You chose a different year.

37:49.404 --> 37:50.804
1898.

37:50.806 --> 37:53.506
The year she died.

37:53.508 --> 37:54.941
John got really upset,

37:54.943 --> 37:56.876
started doing

37:56.878 --> 37:58.979
that menacing thing
with his voice.

37:58.981 --> 38:00.547
That's why I had
to hide, you see,

38:00.549 --> 38:02.883
and I'm guessing it's why
he had to come back to you,

38:02.885 --> 38:04.918
hoping you could still somehow
fulfill his dream.

38:06.621 --> 38:07.854
So you intended
to use me

38:07.856 --> 38:09.590
for your own
selfish agenda.

38:09.592 --> 38:10.924
How shocking.

38:10.926 --> 38:12.159
Of course not,
Helen--

38:12.161 --> 38:14.894
Oh, give it up, John.

38:14.896 --> 38:16.262
She knows.

38:16.264 --> 38:18.464
Least you could do is
have the decency to admit it.

38:18.466 --> 38:20.799
Don't talk to me of decency.

38:20.801 --> 38:22.901
I let you live!

38:22.903 --> 38:23.901
Twice.

38:23.903 --> 38:26.370
Part of the game.

38:26.372 --> 38:27.704
I just play it better.

38:36.347 --> 38:37.548
So, according
to Worth's logs,

38:37.550 --> 38:38.849
he was meeting with
the leaders

38:38.851 --> 38:40.718
of a bunch of different
tribes down there,

38:40.720 --> 38:41.886
including Thelo.

38:41.888 --> 38:43.288
Yeah, always in
the same location.

38:43.290 --> 38:47.326
Here, look,
coordinates.

38:47.328 --> 38:49.228
Can you run
a thermographic scan

38:49.230 --> 38:50.563
of those areas?

38:50.565 --> 38:51.497
Yeah.

38:52.967 --> 38:54.767
Here.

39:06.913 --> 39:08.714
Dude...

39:08.716 --> 39:10.415
Is that what I think it is?

39:12.284 --> 39:13.618
Armies.

39:13.620 --> 39:15.887
Massed beneath
three dormant calderas--

39:15.889 --> 39:18.557
Chile, Indonesia, and Russia.

39:18.559 --> 39:19.558
<i>What are they</i>
<i>doing there?</i>

39:19.560 --> 39:21.427
Preparing to invade.

39:21.429 --> 39:23.797
This entire hostage situation
has been a ruse

39:23.799 --> 39:25.832
to disguise
a much larger invasion.

39:25.834 --> 39:28.402
<i>How can we be certain</i>
<i>those are armies,</i>

39:28.404 --> 39:29.336
<i>not just</i>
<i>more refugees?</i>

39:29.338 --> 39:30.838
Praxis was the only thing

39:30.840 --> 39:32.440
holding this
mass of abnormals back.

39:32.442 --> 39:33.841
Now it's gone.

39:33.843 --> 39:35.977
It's the only possibility
that makes any sense.

39:35.979 --> 39:38.012
<i>But there must be</i>
<i>half a mile of solid rock</i>

39:38.014 --> 39:39.480
<i>covering those calderas.</i>

39:39.482 --> 39:40.981
<i>How are they planning</i>
<i>to breach the surface?</i>

39:40.983 --> 39:42.282
Worth's weapon.

39:42.284 --> 39:43.116
<i>Who?</i>

39:43.118 --> 39:44.250
Adam Worth.

39:44.252 --> 39:45.685
He's a 19th
century genius,

39:45.687 --> 39:46.686
but he's a little
crazypants.

39:46.688 --> 39:48.521
Long story short,

39:48.523 --> 39:49.556
he's the reason
Magnus had to leave.

39:49.558 --> 39:50.657
Now, we've got information

39:50.659 --> 39:51.924
that he's built
a powerful weapon

39:51.926 --> 39:53.793
and hidden it
somewhere in Hollow Earth.

39:53.795 --> 39:55.528
We just didn't know what
the abnormal connection was,

39:55.530 --> 39:56.562
until now.

39:56.564 --> 39:57.964
<i>Hang on.</i>

39:57.966 --> 39:59.599
<i>W-we're assuming</i>
<i>a lot here.</i>

39:59.601 --> 40:01.034
There's got to be a reason

40:01.036 --> 40:03.370
all of this is happening
at the same time.

40:03.372 --> 40:04.972
<i>I'm going to require</i>
<i>a lot more than a hunch</i>

40:04.974 --> 40:06.808
<i>before sounding the alarm</i>
<i>on a global invasion.</i>

40:06.810 --> 40:08.176
Okay,

40:08.178 --> 40:10.479
but by the time I find proof,
it could be too late.

40:11.849 --> 40:12.915
Hang on, we might
already be there.

40:12.917 --> 40:13.716
I'm detecting
a major power buildup

40:13.718 --> 40:14.684
deep below the surface.

40:18.555 --> 40:19.821
Don't talk to me.

40:19.823 --> 40:21.089
You can't seriously believe
that I would lead you--

40:21.091 --> 40:21.923
Can't I?

40:21.925 --> 40:23.925
You let
Adam Worth live,

40:23.927 --> 40:25.393
twice!

40:25.395 --> 40:26.927
Everything else
is beside the point.

40:26.929 --> 40:28.328
We need to get him back.

40:28.330 --> 40:29.329
How?

40:29.331 --> 40:30.863
We've overloaded
these devices.

40:30.865 --> 40:32.832
There's no way
to siphon enough power.

40:32.834 --> 40:35.501
Face it, John,
we've both lost.

40:35.503 --> 40:37.602
No, we haven't.

40:37.604 --> 40:38.604
There's another way.

40:40.040 --> 40:41.273
What are you doing?

40:41.275 --> 40:44.643
The creature inside me
lives on energy.

40:44.645 --> 40:47.913
I need only feed it
with what powers the rift field.

40:47.915 --> 40:49.048
You can't do that.

40:49.050 --> 40:50.549
The creature will
become too powerful.

40:50.551 --> 40:51.817
It will consume you.

40:51.819 --> 40:53.685
I caused this, Helen.

40:53.687 --> 40:54.753
I need to fix it.

41:07.435 --> 41:09.135
Johnny, I always knew
you were crazy,

41:09.137 --> 41:10.836
but I never expected this.

41:14.107 --> 41:15.674
You're too late.

41:18.745 --> 41:20.612
Never enough time, is there?

41:23.650 --> 41:24.516
John?

41:25.719 --> 41:26.952
Almost!

41:43.537 --> 41:46.538
You can't blame me
for the dream, Helen.

41:46.540 --> 41:49.841
The hell I can't.

42:04.021 --> 42:06.022
I'm getting reports
of massive explosions

42:06.024 --> 42:07.690
from the sites of
each of the calderas.

42:07.692 --> 42:09.759
<i>Let's see them.</i>

42:12.029 --> 42:12.862
There.

42:12.864 --> 42:15.765
Can you zoom in?

42:20.806 --> 42:22.507
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

42:22.509 --> 42:24.209
There's thousands of them.

42:26.212 --> 42:28.714
It's an invasion.
