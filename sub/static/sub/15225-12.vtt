Set him down here, guys.

01:24.467 --> 01:26.434
Alex, what happened?

01:26.467 --> 01:28.901
Well, he came out and hit
you with a left and...

01:28.934 --> 01:29.901
Then what?

01:29.934 --> 01:31.100
Describe the whole fight
to me.

01:31.133 --> 01:33.200
I just did.

01:33.234 --> 01:35.200
Well, I guess my memory's
okay then.

01:35.234 --> 01:36.467
Hey, hold up, guys.

01:36.501 --> 01:39.167
Hey, uh, Tony, am I supposed
to tip them or something?

01:39.200 --> 01:42.567
I usually don't unless
they've been especially nice.

01:42.601 --> 01:44.067
Thank you, guys.

01:44.100 --> 01:46.734
Hey, Tony, you all right?

01:46.767 --> 01:49.133
Yeah. Hey, Lou,
I'm sorry I let you down.

01:49.167 --> 01:50.334
Nah, you did fine.

01:50.367 --> 01:52.067
I had you ahead on points.

01:52.100 --> 01:53.434
The doctor's coming.

01:53.467 --> 01:54.601
Oh, great.

01:54.634 --> 01:55.901
Hi.

01:55.934 --> 01:57.467
Hey, Shotgun.
Hey, man, I'm sorry

01:57.501 --> 01:59.033
I couldn't give you
a better fight tonight.

01:59.067 --> 02:00.467
Hey, that's okay.
That's okay.

02:00.501 --> 02:02.434
Hey, and I know you
trained pretty hard
for this fight,

02:02.467 --> 02:04.334
but, don't worry, someday,
it's gonna come in handy.

02:04.367 --> 02:07.767
Right. Look, uh...
yeah, you take care
of yourself, right?

02:07.801 --> 02:09.267
Geez, that's class, huh?

02:09.300 --> 02:11.000
Guy comes in to check on me.
Big guy.

02:11.032 --> 02:14.667
Man, I told you
this was the wrong locker room.

02:16.601 --> 02:18.400
All right, Tony,
here's your money.

02:18.434 --> 02:19.734
All right, Lou.

02:19.767 --> 02:21.968
Yeah, you get, uh,

02:37.801 --> 02:39.868
Hello, Tony.

02:39.901 --> 02:41.133
Hey, Dr. Webster,
how you doing?

02:41.167 --> 02:42.467
Doc, take a look at him,
will ya?

02:42.501 --> 02:44.567
I'll be back later.
I'm gonna watch the next fight.

02:50.033 --> 02:52.133
Okay, Tony, sit up here,
so I can take a look at you.

02:52.167 --> 02:53.367
All right, Doc.

02:53.400 --> 02:54.367
( <i>groans</i> )

02:54.400 --> 02:55.467
Headache?

02:55.501 --> 02:57.133
Not bad.
Uh-huh.

02:58.367 --> 03:01.267
Here... here,
follow this light

03:01.300 --> 03:02.801
with your eyes.

03:03.834 --> 03:05.367
Uh-huh.

03:08.501 --> 03:10.467
Tony, what's your record?

03:10.501 --> 03:12.901
I'm about, uh,
eight and 24.

03:14.734 --> 03:16.667
How many have you
lost by knockout?

03:16.701 --> 03:18.334
Well, it depends
what you mean by knockout.

03:18.367 --> 03:20.400
I mean, uh, sometimes
I'm just taking a rest,

03:20.434 --> 03:23.467
and the ref is counting
real fast...
Come on, Tony.

03:23.501 --> 03:24.901
14 times.

03:24.934 --> 03:26.367
How about recently?

03:26.400 --> 03:27.434
Uh...

03:27.467 --> 03:29.367
Three times in the last
five fights, Tony?

03:29.400 --> 03:31.667
Yeah.

03:31.701 --> 03:33.834
Hey, Dr. Webster,

03:33.868 --> 03:36.868
what's wrong with him?

03:36.901 --> 03:38.567
He leads with his right.

03:38.601 --> 03:40.000
No, I mean his body.

03:40.033 --> 03:41.734
What's wrong with his body?

03:41.767 --> 03:44.133
Well, for one thing,
I didn't care
for his reaction

03:44.167 --> 03:45.534
to the examination
I gave him

03:45.567 --> 03:47.067
in the ring,
after the knockout.

03:47.100 --> 03:48.968
All you did was
ask me my name.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
Yeah, but you gave me
the wrong answer.

03:51.033 --> 03:54.734
But once you told me
what it was, I recognized it.

03:56.267 --> 03:59.200
Doc, is he going
to be okay or not?

03:59.234 --> 04:01.701
Well, nothing here requires
immediate medical attention.

04:01.734 --> 04:02.767
Oh, great.

04:02.801 --> 04:04.267
Thank you.

04:04.300 --> 04:08.033
Tony... Tony,
listen, uh...

04:08.067 --> 04:11.968
has any doctor ever advised you
to, uh... quit boxing?

04:12.000 --> 04:13.200
Yeah, I suppose.

04:13.234 --> 04:14.534
You suppose?

04:14.567 --> 04:17.534
A lot of guys yelled at me
to get out of the ring.

04:17.567 --> 04:19.666
Some of them might
have been doctors.

04:21.567 --> 04:22.767
Dr. Webster, come on.

04:22.801 --> 04:24.434
There's something
on your mind.

04:24.467 --> 04:25.434
Why don't you tell us?

04:25.467 --> 04:28.200
Well, Tony's record
worries me.

04:28.234 --> 04:30.200
Hey, look, so I ain't
no Rocky Marciano.

04:30.234 --> 04:31.934
Listen, Tony, let me
tell you a story.

04:31.968 --> 04:33.901
I mean, there was a
fighter here last year--

04:33.934 --> 04:35.133
a middleweight
like you, you know.

04:35.167 --> 04:36.133
He lost a lot of fights.

04:36.167 --> 04:38.434
He got knocked out a lot,
you know?

04:38.467 --> 04:40.567
I mean, he kept on fighting,

04:40.601 --> 04:42.734
even though he
kept getting beat

04:42.767 --> 04:45.501
every time he walked
into the ring.

04:45.534 --> 04:47.334
I'm sorry to say...

04:47.367 --> 04:49.567
he doesn't fight anymore.

04:49.601 --> 04:50.901
Me too.

04:50.934 --> 04:52.767
I'd like a shot at him.

04:52.801 --> 04:55.334
Tony, he doesn't fight anymore
because he can't fight.

04:55.367 --> 04:58.334
He also can't drive,
or he can't hold a job.

04:58.367 --> 05:00.634
That's because of the damage
that he suffered in the ring.

05:00.667 --> 05:02.901
He never should have
been allowed to fight.

05:02.934 --> 05:05.934
Now, Tony, I don't know if
you've suffered any damage yet,

05:05.968 --> 05:07.234
but I can't take
the risk

05:07.267 --> 05:09.300
of having the same thing
happen to you.

05:09.334 --> 05:10.334
Hey, wait a second.

05:10.367 --> 05:12.234
What are we talking
about here, Doc?

05:12.267 --> 05:13.901
Tony...

05:13.934 --> 05:16.267
I think you
should quit fighting.

05:16.300 --> 05:17.968
You come in here,
you look at me

05:18.000 --> 05:20.367
for ten seconds
and you want
to end my career.

05:20.400 --> 05:21.701
Tony, you get some damage

05:21.734 --> 05:23.634
every time you
suffer a knockout.

05:23.667 --> 05:24.968
Big deal.
Fighters get knocked out.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.434
Hey, let me tell you
something:

05:26.467 --> 05:28.234
I've been knocked out
a million times--

05:28.267 --> 05:29.701
I been knocked out more
times than I can remember.

05:29.734 --> 05:32.501
Tony, you're not helping
your case.

05:32.534 --> 05:34.033
Tony, I'm taking your case
to the medical board

05:34.067 --> 05:35.334
and see what they
have to say about it.

05:35.367 --> 05:38.868
Well, I don't care,
'cause I ain't quitting boxing.

05:46.834 --> 05:50.501
Listen, Ma,
I'm serious about this.

05:50.534 --> 05:52.534
At a certain age,

05:52.567 --> 05:55.701
you don't care
about birthdays anymore.

05:55.734 --> 06:01.667
Please, no cake, no presents,
no dinner, no nothing.

06:03.667 --> 06:07.033
All right, all right,
if you insist.

06:07.067 --> 06:10.701
* Happy birthday to you 

06:10.734 --> 06:14.367
* Happy birthday
to you *

06:14.400 --> 06:18.000
* Happy birthday, crazy lady 

06:18.033 --> 06:21.534
* Happy birthday to you.

( <i>growling</i> )

06:29.367 --> 06:31.167
Hey, I may get you...

06:31.200 --> 06:33.934
Would you say
that I look frumpy today?

06:33.968 --> 06:35.167
Well...
Uh... uh...

06:35.200 --> 06:36.767
ELAINE:
No, no, no, I'm trying
to look frumpy.

06:36.801 --> 06:37.767
Oh, well,
you've done it.

06:37.801 --> 06:38.767
Quite frumpy.

06:38.801 --> 06:39.834
Yeah, well, I just

06:39.868 --> 06:42.601
got so sick of guys
hitting on me while I'm driving,

06:42.634 --> 06:44.534
so I figured if
I dressed like this,

06:44.567 --> 06:45.701
they'd stop doing it.

06:45.734 --> 06:46.734
Did it work?

06:46.767 --> 06:48.634
No. I just get hit on

06:48.667 --> 06:51.400
by a crummier class of creeps.

06:51.434 --> 06:53.901
Hey, foxy lady.

06:59.400 --> 07:01.801
I see exactly
what you mean.

on the curb side.

07:40.634 --> 07:42.067

07:43.667 --> 07:46.601
Hey, Jim, do you have
any idea who that was?

07:46.634 --> 07:49.767
No, but he sure was
a good listener.

I'll take care of it.

I got it. Got it.

07:59.801 --> 08:01.067
Hello?

08:02.801 --> 08:04.133
Yeah, yeah.

08:04.167 --> 08:05.634
Hey, Tony! Tony, it's for you.

08:05.667 --> 08:08.534
It's a Dr. Webster
from the boxing commission.

08:08.567 --> 08:09.701
Boom!

08:09.734 --> 08:11.234
All right.

08:12.567 --> 08:15.834
Yeah. Hey, how you doing,
Dr. Webster?

08:15.868 --> 08:18.167
What's that?

08:18.200 --> 08:20.501
I don't understand.

08:20.534 --> 08:23.501
Aw, come on, Dr. Webster,
this ain't fair.

08:23.534 --> 08:25.501
They can't do that.

08:25.534 --> 08:28.667
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
for my own good.

08:28.701 --> 08:30.167
Thanks.

08:30.200 --> 08:32.667
I can't believe it.

08:32.701 --> 08:34.100
Tony, what is it?

08:34.133 --> 08:36.868
They just took away
my boxing license.

08:36.900 --> 08:39.133
Oh, no! That's terrible!

08:39.167 --> 08:40.200
Can they do that?

08:40.234 --> 08:41.900
They can do it
and they just did it.

08:41.933 --> 08:44.234
They said they don't like
the looks of my record.

08:44.267 --> 08:45.434
They're worried about me,

08:45.467 --> 08:47.067
'cause I get
knocked out too much.

08:47.100 --> 08:48.567
Is there somebody
you can appeal to?

08:48.601 --> 08:50.501
Nobody. What am I going to do?

08:50.534 --> 08:52.067
I mean boxing's my whole life.

08:53.534 --> 08:55.000
Oh...

08:55.033 --> 08:57.200
Tony, I got to tell you
something.

08:57.234 --> 09:00.200
Um... maybe it's the wrong time,
and everything,

09:00.234 --> 09:03.534
but I'm glad you're getting out
of that awful sport.

09:03.567 --> 09:06.300
I hated it when I had
to go see you fight.

09:06.334 --> 09:07.000
You did?

09:07.033 --> 09:08.334
Yeah, I did.

09:08.367 --> 09:10.501
I mean, I can tell what
a great sport it is.

09:10.534 --> 09:11.868
You know, uh,
standing up there

09:11.901 --> 09:14.968
in front of a bunch of bums
and creeps and drunks,

09:15.000 --> 09:16.767
getting your head bashed in.

09:16.801 --> 09:20.667
Oh, the glamour's part of it.

09:20.701 --> 09:23.667
Tony... Tony,
I wouldn't say this

09:23.701 --> 09:27.234
if I didn't know
our friendship could take it.

09:27.267 --> 09:30.234
Tony, you're not
that good a boxer.

09:30.267 --> 09:31.934
I know that, Bobby.

09:31.968 --> 09:33.601
Well, why do you care then?

09:33.634 --> 09:35.334
Because that doesn't
matter to me.

09:35.367 --> 09:36.934
You see, maybe
when I first started,

09:36.968 --> 09:38.834
you know, I had dreams
of getting a title...

09:38.868 --> 09:41.667
but I gave up on that
a long time ago.

09:41.701 --> 09:43.334
I ain't no great fighter.

09:43.367 --> 09:46.033
I can't even say
I had one great fight,

09:46.067 --> 09:49.200
not even one great round--
but there have been moments.

09:49.234 --> 09:50.467
You see, not a day goes by,

09:50.501 --> 09:52.400
I don't think about this fight
in Jersey.

09:52.434 --> 09:55.200
During the second round, I threw
a three-punch combination--

09:55.234 --> 09:57.534
left, right, left hook.

09:57.567 --> 09:58.701
It was perfect.

09:58.734 --> 10:00.200
I heard the crowd gasp.

10:00.234 --> 10:01.534
For that one second,

10:01.567 --> 10:04.367
Tony Banta was as great
as Muhammad Ali, Sugar Ray

10:04.400 --> 10:06.033
or any of them.

10:06.067 --> 10:07.300
I always thought that, maybe,

10:07.334 --> 10:09.367
I'd put a few of those moments
together someday,

10:09.400 --> 10:10.434
and have that great fight.

10:12.067 --> 10:15.200
I mean, when I look back on it,
I feel kind of special.

10:15.234 --> 10:17.467
Without it,
I'm just a cab driver--

10:17.501 --> 10:19.100
just a lousy cab driver.

10:19.133 --> 10:21.167
Uh, uh, uh, Tony, uh...

10:21.200 --> 10:22.300
Oh, hey, no offense.

10:22.334 --> 10:23.634
ALEX:
That's all right, Tony.

10:23.667 --> 10:25.000
I'm not really
a cab driver.

10:25.033 --> 10:27.701
I'm just waiting for
something better
to come along...

10:29.467 --> 10:31.367
...you know, like death.

10:33.367 --> 10:38.901
Well, if you guys don't mind,
I'm going to tie one on.

10:38.934 --> 10:41.400
I'll go too.

10:41.434 --> 10:44.701
I love Chinese restaurants.

10:46.601 --> 10:48.567
LOUIE:
What are you hanging
around here for?

10:48.601 --> 10:51.434
Don't you have lives?

10:51.467 --> 10:54.667
Louie, they took away
my boxing license.

10:57.133 --> 10:58.601
Oh, no.

10:58.634 --> 11:00.234
Oh, no.

11:00.267 --> 11:01.501
Tony, no.

11:01.534 --> 11:04.634
That's not fair.

11:04.667 --> 11:06.634
Oh, no.

11:06.667 --> 11:09.834
Hey, Louie, I didn't think
you'd take it so hard.

11:09.868 --> 11:11.167
Are you kidding?

11:11.200 --> 11:14.200
I made a fortune
betting against you.

11:16.400 --> 11:19.934
You know, that is so typical of
you to think only of yourself

11:19.968 --> 11:21.367
at a time like this.

11:21.400 --> 11:23.367
Well, for your
information, Nardo,

11:23.400 --> 11:26.400
I happen to need money
right now.

11:26.434 --> 11:30.033
I'm saving up for an operation
for my ma.

11:30.067 --> 11:32.734
Oh, Louie, I'm sorry.

11:32.767 --> 11:34.734
I... what's wrong?

11:34.767 --> 11:36.567
It's female problems.

11:36.601 --> 11:40.968
She's starting
not to look like one.

11:54.734 --> 11:55.701
Hi, Bob.

11:55.734 --> 11:57.801
Hey, Bobby.
Hey, uh...

11:57.834 --> 11:59.033
how's Tony lately?

11:59.067 --> 12:00.267
I don't know.

12:00.300 --> 12:02.000
I haven't seen much of him.

12:02.033 --> 12:05.200
I guess he wants to work this
one out by himself, you know?

12:05.234 --> 12:06.801
Maybe I'm insensitive,

12:06.834 --> 12:10.300
but I don't see
what the problem is, you know.

12:10.334 --> 12:12.934
I can't imagine
missing that sport.

12:12.968 --> 12:15.934
Elaine, boxing
is Tony's life.

12:15.968 --> 12:19.868
I mean, it would be like me
if I had to give up acting.

12:19.901 --> 12:23.567
But when you act,
no one gets brutalized.

12:23.601 --> 12:27.601
Only the playwright and anyone
trapped in the theater.

12:29.901 --> 12:33.634
How long have you been
waiting for this one, Louie?

12:33.667 --> 12:35.901
Years.

12:35.934 --> 12:37.234
LOU-LOU:
Hello, Alex.

12:37.267 --> 12:38.567
ALEX:
Hey, Lou-Lou.

12:38.601 --> 12:40.534
Hey, everybody,
this is Lou-Lou Pantuso.

12:40.567 --> 12:42.601
He's the guy
that bought Tony's contract.

12:42.634 --> 12:43.601
How you doin', Lou.
Hi.

12:43.634 --> 12:46.234
Must have got it in a fire sale.

12:46.267 --> 12:48.767
That and the suit he's wearing.

12:48.801 --> 12:52.267
Does he work in there,
or is he just on display?

12:52.300 --> 12:53.834
Ignore him. Ignore him.

12:53.868 --> 12:55.133
What's up, Lou-Lou?
What's up?

12:55.167 --> 12:57.601
Well, I got to talk
to you guys.

12:57.634 --> 12:58.734
What's the problem?

12:58.767 --> 12:59.934
Somebody's got to talk to Tony.

12:59.968 --> 13:01.100
I wasn't going to say anything.

13:01.133 --> 13:02.234
I promised Tony I wouldn't,

13:02.267 --> 13:04.100
but I just don't feel right
about what's going on.

13:04.133 --> 13:06.000
He's got this idea

13:06.033 --> 13:07.968
that he's gonna fight
under another name.

13:08.000 --> 13:08.767
What?!

13:08.801 --> 13:09.834
Yeah, there's this fighter

13:09.868 --> 13:10.767
in Jersey who retired,

13:10.801 --> 13:12.334
and we bought up his license,
and, uh,

13:12.367 --> 13:14.267
Tony's gonna fight
under his name from now on.

13:14.300 --> 13:15.501
Oh, no...
I can't believe this!

13:15.534 --> 13:16.901
Hold it, can he get
away with this?

13:16.934 --> 13:18.534
Unfortunately, yes.

13:18.567 --> 13:19.767
And the crazy thing is

13:19.801 --> 13:22.100
he's gonna fight under the name
"Kid Rodriguez."

13:22.133 --> 13:23.801
Kid Rodriguez?!

13:23.834 --> 13:25.234
Well, that explains
his attitude.

13:25.267 --> 13:27.133
That explains why we haven't
seen him lately.

13:27.167 --> 13:30.634
That explains
his <i>buenos dias</i> yesterday.

13:30.667 --> 13:33.067
Hey, I tried to talk him out of
it but he won't listen to me.

13:33.100 --> 13:35.234
So, if he's gonna do it,
it's better if I'm with him.

13:35.267 --> 13:37.033
Well, listen, Lou-Lou,
I'm glad you came to us first,

13:37.067 --> 13:38.434
so we have a chance
to talk him out of it

13:38.467 --> 13:39.634
before he actually
gets a fight.

13:39.667 --> 13:40.834
You got an hour and a half.

13:40.868 --> 13:42.100
He's fighting tonight?!

13:42.133 --> 13:43.467
Yeah, at Brooklyn Armory,
third bout.

13:43.501 --> 13:45.367
Look, he's waiting for me.
I'm gonna go, all right?

13:45.400 --> 13:47.067
We'll see you there!

13:47.100 --> 13:49.434
All right,
so what do we do?

13:49.467 --> 13:51.367
Somebody's got
to talk to him.

13:51.400 --> 13:52.634
But what do we say?

13:52.667 --> 13:54.968
We got to tell him
that, that boxing,

13:55.000 --> 13:58.634
it destroys your brain,
it damages your nervous system

13:58.667 --> 14:04.000
and it leaves you a stumbling,
disoriented, pathetic wreck.

14:04.033 --> 14:07.167
And if that's what he wants,

14:07.200 --> 14:11.567
there are easier ways
of getting there.

14:11.601 --> 14:13.367
Let's go.
Come on.

14:13.400 --> 14:15.033
Come on,
let's get out of here.

14:15.067 --> 14:16.834
LOUIE:
What's going on here?

14:16.868 --> 14:18.767
ELAINE:
Tony's fighting again.

14:18.801 --> 14:19.801
Banta?

14:19.834 --> 14:21.801
My sure thing is back?

14:21.834 --> 14:23.834
The born-again loser?

14:31.300 --> 14:32.601
Hello, Ma?

14:32.634 --> 14:33.934
Great news.

14:33.968 --> 14:36.434
You can have that operation
you wanted.

14:36.467 --> 14:37.634
That's right.

14:37.667 --> 14:40.634
You've been called "sir"
for the last time.

14:51.133 --> 14:52.701
I want you to hit,
and don't get hit.

14:52.734 --> 14:54.868
I want you to keep moving
and stick it to him.

14:54.901 --> 14:57.033
Hey! Aren't you guys
ready yet?

14:57.067 --> 14:59.868
Give us a few more
minutes, will ya?

14:59.901 --> 15:02.567
Okay, there,
you're all taped.

15:02.601 --> 15:04.167
Aw, geez,
look at that.

15:04.200 --> 15:04.968
I got to do it
all over ag...

15:05.000 --> 15:06.934
Lou-Lou, you already
did it six times.

15:06.968 --> 15:08.033
Now, come on,
cut the tape.

15:08.067 --> 15:09.434
Oh, Tony, I can't let
anybody see that.

15:09.467 --> 15:10.467
I'll be embarrassed
to death!

15:10.501 --> 15:12.567
Cut it, Lou-Lou.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.033
Oh, finally.

15:15.067 --> 15:16.767
We got stuck in traffic.
Yeah.

15:16.801 --> 15:17.701
Hi, Tony.

15:17.734 --> 15:19.234
What are you guys
doing here?

15:19.267 --> 15:21.601
Uh, Lou-Lou, can we have
a couple of moments
alone with Tony, please?

15:21.634 --> 15:24.334
Yeah. I got a million important
details to take care of.

15:29.200 --> 15:31.300
Lou-Lou squealed, huh?

15:31.334 --> 15:32.634
Yes, he did.

15:32.667 --> 15:35.634
He says you're fighting
under the name of Kid Rodriguez?

15:35.667 --> 15:37.968
Pretty good name, eh?
Kid Rodriguez.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Yeah.

15:39.033 --> 15:40.234
You're not gonna
fight tonight, Tony.

15:40.267 --> 15:41.400
Oh, yes, I am.

15:41.434 --> 15:43.033
No, you're not, 'cause
we're going to stop you.

15:43.067 --> 15:44.834
Tony, we decided, we're not
leaving this room

15:44.868 --> 15:46.834
until we talk you
out of this.

15:46.868 --> 15:49.567
That's right, Tony.

15:49.601 --> 15:52.501
This sport is
a savage blood battle

15:52.534 --> 15:55.934
that no right-thinking
person can condone.

15:55.968 --> 15:59.534
It appeals
to the worst instincts in men

15:59.567 --> 16:03.801
and reduces the dignity
of the entire human race.

16:03.834 --> 16:07.367
And, besides, the bull
doesn't stand a chance.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.868
Jim, I ain't bullfighting.

16:09.901 --> 16:13.701
All right, Tony.

16:13.734 --> 16:16.167
I'm proud of you.

16:16.200 --> 16:18.667
Let's go, guys.

16:18.701 --> 16:20.000
Jim, Jim, Jim,
Jim, Jim...

16:20.033 --> 16:21.834
Let me handle this.
I can handle this.

16:21.868 --> 16:24.067
Tony, you're
not fighting tonight.

16:24.100 --> 16:25.100
Oh, yes, I am, Bob.

16:25.133 --> 16:26.434
No, you're not fighting
tonight,

16:26.467 --> 16:28.901
and I'm gonna tell you why
you're not fighting tonight.

16:28.934 --> 16:31.868
Because you can't fight
if you don't have
any trunks to wear.

16:31.901 --> 16:36.267
Anybody see
a pair of blue trunks?

16:42.901 --> 16:46.868
I'll pay you $1,000
if you don't hurt my face.

16:46.901 --> 16:49.300
Give me five.

16:49.334 --> 16:50.501
All right!

16:50.534 --> 16:51.634
I mean dollars.

16:51.667 --> 16:53.667
Okay.

16:56.400 --> 16:58.133
I just got real lucky,
didn't I?

16:58.167 --> 16:59.501
Yes. Real lucky.

16:59.534 --> 17:00.934
Come on, guys.
I can't stall anymore.

17:00.968 --> 17:03.133
Promoter says I got to get
my fighter in the ring now,

17:03.167 --> 17:04.467
or I have to get
in there myself.

17:04.501 --> 17:06.666
Okay, look, uh,
could you guys give me

17:06.701 --> 17:07.666
a moment alone
with Tony, please?

17:07.701 --> 17:09.800
Oh, yeah, that's a good i...
that's a good idea.

17:09.834 --> 17:10.800
Hey, uh, Jim,

17:10.834 --> 17:12.000
come on, I'll buy
you some popcorn.

17:12.032 --> 17:13.601
Come on.
Okey-doke.

17:13.634 --> 17:16.434
Uh, by the way, Tony,

17:16.467 --> 17:21.334
I don't want to criticize
the way you dress

17:21.367 --> 17:25.467
but if you put on
your shoes last,

17:25.501 --> 17:27.901
it won't be so hard

17:27.934 --> 17:31.934
pulling your pants on
over them.

17:31.968 --> 17:34.634
Jim? Popcorn, popcorn.

17:34.667 --> 17:36.968
Tony, listen
to what Alex has to say.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.667
Fighting makes you
punchy after awhile.

17:39.701 --> 17:42.667
How many fights
has he been in?

17:42.701 --> 17:45.868
Just the one with reality.

17:47.067 --> 17:48.934
Hey, Alex, there's
nothing you can say, Alex.

17:48.968 --> 17:50.367
I been over this
a lot in my mind.

17:50.400 --> 17:51.868
I been over every argument,
so forget it, Alex.

17:51.901 --> 17:52.868
There's nothing you could say.

17:52.901 --> 17:53.901
Tony, I don't want to have

17:53.934 --> 17:54.968
a big struggle about this.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.501
Now, I want you to think
about your health.

17:56.534 --> 17:57.868
I'm talking about
your physical health.

17:57.901 --> 17:59.501
Boxers who take too many
blows to the head...

17:59.534 --> 18:02.033
Guys that are punchy
start acting weird.

18:02.067 --> 18:03.634
You don't see me acting
weird, do you, Alex?

18:03.667 --> 18:04.667
Gee...

18:06.100 --> 18:08.501
 <i>Me llamo Kid Rodriguez.</i>

18:08.534 --> 18:11.601
 <i>Kid Rodriguez, me llamo.</i>

18:11.634 --> 18:13.501
 <i>Hola.</i>

18:13.534 --> 18:16.400
Tony, I'm very serious
about this!

18:16.434 --> 18:18.000
Hey, look...
You're not gonna
fight tonight!

18:18.033 --> 18:19.868
I'm gonna stop you
if I have to use
physical force!

18:19.901 --> 18:21.767
Hey, <i>esta loco.</i>

18:21.801 --> 18:23.834
Tony! Tony, no,
I'm serious!

18:23.868 --> 18:25.567
Now, look, the only way
you're going to get
through this door

18:25.601 --> 18:26.667
is through me.

18:26.701 --> 18:29.167
Tony, it's time.

18:29.200 --> 18:30.167
 <i>Adios,</i> Alex.

18:30.200 --> 18:31.167
Wait, Tony.

18:31.200 --> 18:32.234
Tony?!

18:42.033 --> 18:43.067
ALEX:
Tony, wait!

18:43.100 --> 18:44.767
Tony, wait a minute.
Tony, Tony, wait, wait...

18:44.801 --> 18:47.033
Alex...

18:47.067 --> 18:48.067
Wait, wait,
just a second.

18:48.100 --> 18:49.434
Tony, you're making
a big mistake.

18:49.467 --> 18:51.300
Alex, can't this wait?
I'm a little busy right now.

18:51.334 --> 18:53.000
No, no, no, Tony,
you're making
a big mistake.

18:53.033 --> 18:54.601
Alex, Alex, I want you
to have a good seat

18:54.634 --> 18:56.667
for Tony's fight,
but this is ridiculous.

18:56.701 --> 18:58.000
I mean, it's too late
for this argument, Alex.

18:58.033 --> 18:59.300
No, it's not, Lou-Lou!

19:00.667 --> 19:03.300
( <i>bell dinging</i> )

19:03.334 --> 19:05.868
Ladies and gentlemen,

19:05.901 --> 19:08.767
the next event
on tonight's card

19:08.801 --> 19:12.334
will be a ten-round,
middleweight contest

19:12.367 --> 19:18.634
between these two scrappy,
Latino contenders.

19:18.667 --> 19:22.234
Presenting, in this corner
on my left,

19:22.267 --> 19:26.901
weighing in at 159 pounds,
wearing black trunks,

19:26.934 --> 19:29.234
sporting a record of 14 and six,

19:29.267 --> 19:37.334
from Los Angeles, California:
Alberto <i>"El Gato"</i> Martinez.

19:37.367 --> 19:40.601
( <i>cheering and booing</i> )

19:40.634 --> 19:42.834
Just listen to me
for one second.

19:42.868 --> 19:45.133
Alex, it's not polite
to talk during
the introductions.

19:45.167 --> 19:46.968
( <i>bell dinging</i> )

19:47.000 --> 19:51.801
Weighing in at 162 pounds...

19:51.834 --> 19:53.767
You lost weight.

19:53.801 --> 19:57.300
...wearing blue trunks
with the gold stripes,

19:57.334 --> 20:00.167
with a record of 23 and eight...

20:00.200 --> 20:03.100
You think I'm quitting
with a record like that?

20:03.133 --> 20:06.200
...originally
from Puerto Rico,

20:06.234 --> 20:12.734
known as "The Pride of
San Juan": Kid Rodriguez.

20:12.767 --> 20:14.767
( <i>cheering</i> )

20:20.901 --> 20:23.467
Tony, there are a lot of other
people to think of, you know,
in this thing!

20:23.501 --> 20:25.000
Alex, I gotta get
my instructions!

20:25.033 --> 20:26.234
REFEREE:
Gentlemen...

20:26.267 --> 20:27.434
Tony, you're... you're
forgetting your friends.

20:27.467 --> 20:29.167
You know, people who love you
who don't want you to fight.

20:29.200 --> 20:31.167
Alex, if they loved me so
much, they'd understand

20:31.200 --> 20:33.167
how much fighting
means to me!

20:33.200 --> 20:34.801
Do you mind
if I go on?

20:34.834 --> 20:35.901
In the event
of a knockdown...

20:35.934 --> 20:36.901
No, you don't have
to finish,

20:36.934 --> 20:37.901
because he's not
fighting tonight.

20:37.934 --> 20:39.767
I am too!
No, you're not.

20:39.801 --> 20:40.934
Yes, I am!
No, you're not!

20:40.968 --> 20:41.968
Well, if you do
decide to fight,

20:42.000 --> 20:43.300
I want a nice clean fight.

20:43.334 --> 20:44.734
I want you to watch
your head-butts.

20:44.767 --> 20:46.667
No punches below the belt.

20:46.701 --> 20:50.868
I want the kidney punches,
all right?

20:50.901 --> 20:52.634
And, in case of a knockdown,

20:52.667 --> 20:54.334
the man scoring the knockdown
goes to the farthest corner

20:54.367 --> 20:56.400
and stays there until
I tell him to come out.

20:56.434 --> 20:58.534
All right, shake hands
and good luck to both of you.

20:58.567 --> 20:59.834
 <i>Demos buena pelea.</i>

20:59.868 --> 21:01.367
 <i>Buena suerte para ti.</i>

21:01.400 --> 21:03.567
 Hey, <i>gracias.</i>
 <i>La cucaracha,</i> man.

21:05.634 --> 21:07.801
Tony, will you just
listen to me for one second?

21:07.834 --> 21:09.033
Just listen to me
for one second, okay?

21:09.067 --> 21:10.801
Alex, I know the risks,
and I want to take them.

21:10.834 --> 21:12.133
It's my business here.

21:12.167 --> 21:15.067
Tony, I just... I, I have
one question to ask you--

21:15.100 --> 21:16.868
just one question,
then I'll shut up.

21:16.901 --> 21:18.167
All right?
All right, Alex, what?

21:18.200 --> 21:19.334
Okay...

21:19.367 --> 21:20.334
How would you feel

21:20.367 --> 21:21.767
if you hurt a
fighter tonight?
Huh?

21:21.801 --> 21:23.234
I mean, if you
really seriously
hurt that fighter?

21:23.267 --> 21:24.801
I'd feel terrible, Alex,
of course I would,

21:24.834 --> 21:25.868
but that ain't gonna happen

21:25.901 --> 21:28.100
because I ain't that good
a boxer, remember?

21:28.133 --> 21:31.067
I mean, if anybody's gonna
get hurt, it's gonna be me.

21:31.100 --> 21:33.000
You-- right, you.

21:33.033 --> 21:35.801
How do you think
he's gonna feel if you
get seriously hurt, huh?

21:35.834 --> 21:36.801
It's gonna be
on his conscience

21:36.834 --> 21:38.100
for the rest
of his life.

21:38.133 --> 21:39.501
Every time you go
into the ring,

21:39.534 --> 21:41.567
you have two lives
that you put on the line.

21:41.601 --> 21:43.167
I need time to think
about this one.

21:43.200 --> 21:44.267
( <i>bell dings</i> )

21:44.300 --> 21:45.400
You don't have time.

21:45.434 --> 21:46.667
Damn it, Alex, who
invited you, anyway?

21:46.701 --> 21:47.734
Hey, Lou-Lou,
I'm throwing it in.

21:47.767 --> 21:48.834
LOU-LOU:
Okay.

21:48.868 --> 21:50.868
Nah. Hey, Hoss,
I decided not to fight.

21:57.200 --> 21:59.901
Let me say it to you
in Spanish-- <i>el stopo.</i>

21:59.934 --> 22:01.067
I'm not fighting.

22:01.100 --> 22:02.434
I'm gonna quit.
I want to give it up.

22:02.467 --> 22:04.467
I don't want
to do it anymore.

22:04.501 --> 22:06.200
 Stop. I said stop.
 <i>El stopo.</i>

22:06.234 --> 22:07.234
Here's the ref.

22:07.267 --> 22:09.200
Maybe you could
talk to him...

22:09.234 --> 22:13.000
Hey, man, I told you
I'm not fighting no more.

22:19.234 --> 22:20.334
Some guys.

22:20.367 --> 22:22.267
ALEX:
All right, Tony.

22:22.300 --> 22:24.868
If you leave the ring,
you lose by default!

22:30.267 --> 22:31.934
The winner!

22:36.734 --> 22:39.634
Well, now that
you've given up boxing,

22:39.667 --> 22:40.767
I just wanted to say

22:40.801 --> 22:44.000
that, uh... we're behind you
whatever you want to do.

22:44.033 --> 22:45.567
I know that, Alex.
Thanks.

22:45.601 --> 22:46.567
Okay.

22:46.601 --> 22:49.334
Hey, Al, you know
what I'm going to do?

22:49.367 --> 22:50.501
I'm going to get together

22:50.534 --> 22:53.167
all the money I made in
boxing all these years,

22:53.200 --> 22:54.634
buy myself a new suit.

22:54.667 --> 22:56.267
Good idea, Tony.

23:14.334 --> 23:16.334

23:30.901 --> 23:34.200

Night, Mr. Walters.
