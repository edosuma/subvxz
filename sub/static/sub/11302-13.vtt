- What is it?

00:11.804 --> 00:13.932
- This truck is a piece of shit.
- [chuckles]

00:15.141 --> 00:18.686
I mean, the alternator's
shot. Ignition coil's all worn.

00:19.479 --> 00:21.648
This fan belt's made
out of what appears to be

00:22.232 --> 00:25.693
duct tape and the belt from a silk robe.

00:25.777 --> 00:27.695

Oh.

00:37.247 --> 00:39.457
Come on, man. This ain't too bad.

00:39.541 --> 00:43.378

a long day of herdin' cattle.

with this piece of shit?

01:41.102 --> 01:42.645

01:47.984 --> 01:51.446
I'm sorry about everything
with Heather. How's she doin'?

01:52.113 --> 01:53.239
She's doing great.

01:53.323 --> 01:55.491

03:12.402 --> 03:13.820
I think it's the tray.

03:16.322 --> 03:18.991
But it tastes better than
the yellow, so I'm eatin' it.

03:19.867 --> 03:22.412
Oh, honey, you can't eat this.

No.

Rooster. I'll be there, too.

03:31.421 --> 03:32.755
Thanks, Mary, but I'm gonna pass.

Rooster.

03:38.803 --> 03:40.555
Fine.

03:40.638 --> 03:41.990

girlfriend and my angry dad.

03:49.105 --> 03:50.773

03:51.274 --> 03:54.277
Rooster said you've hardly even
left the ranch since she took off.

03:54.819 --> 03:55.862
Oh, he did, did he?

03:55.945 --> 03:58.757
Oh, that's funny you remember that part,
but you forgot the part where I said,

03:58.781 --> 04:00.221
"Don't tell my dad I told you this."

04:03.119 --> 04:04.412
You doin' all right?

04:04.495 --> 04:07.749
Well, my wife of 40 years left me,

04:07.832 --> 04:12.754
but I still got Colt and Rooster here to
remind me of all the mistakes we made.

You don't have to do the dishes,
and you don't have to eat the dishes.

She's not gonna take no for an
answer. She can be very persuasive.

I left over on your porch?

09:45.753 --> 09:48.130
No, there wasn't any, uh...

09:48.214 --> 09:50.466

about those two bags of flour?

09:50.549 --> 09:51.675

Oh, okay, so, I'm at
the grocery store, right?

10:01.310 --> 10:03.646
And I walk in, and I see a dozen roses

10:03.729 --> 10:06.190
and I think, "Oh, man, I
should get these for Abby."

10:06.273 --> 10:08.168
And, well... I mean, they
were the nice ones, too.

10:08.192 --> 10:09.485
They were like $9.99.

10:11.112 --> 10:13.948
Then I think, "What if
Kenny sees 'em?" Right?

10:14.031 --> 10:16.700
So, I'm walkin' around and
I'm like, "What do I get her?"

10:16.784 --> 10:19.537
And then it hits me. Flour.

10:21.664 --> 10:24.917
Well, then I got two of 'em, so
there's an "S." Flours. [Chuckles]

10:26.961 --> 10:29.547
Oh, my God, that is the lamest
thing I've ever heard. [Chuckles]

10:29.630 --> 10:32.049
Oh, yeah, it's so lame
that you're smilin'.

10:32.133 --> 10:34.343
You liked my flours. [Chuckles]

10:36.679 --> 10:40.683
You know that flour doesn't
have a plural. It's just flour.

10:41.767 --> 10:43.853
I didn't get you
flour. I got you flours.

10:43.936 --> 10:46.397
Okay. [Chuckles] No. I'm sayin'...

10:47.565 --> 10:50.776
- You know what? Thank you.
- Yeah.

10:50.860 --> 10:54.029
Oh, hey, speaking of breaking
up with Kenny, did you do it yet?

10:56.157 --> 10:58.617
Not yet. I mean, his mom's been in town.

10:58.701 --> 11:01.954
She's stayin' with me. She taught me the
family recipe for chicken cacciatore.

11:02.037 --> 11:04.623
Oh. Did she teach you how
to make the chicken parmesan?

11:05.624 --> 11:08.878
- No, why?
- 'Cause it's awesome. Duh.

11:08.961 --> 11:11.172
- [both chuckle]
- Hey.

11:12.089 --> 11:14.133
You still wanna do this, right?

11:14.925 --> 11:18.304
Absolutely. It's just, it's
hard. It's a matter of timing.

11:18.387 --> 11:21.140
Yeah, no. Yeah, I get
it. It's no problem.

11:21.223 --> 11:22.474

12:06.435 --> 12:08.187
Yeah, yeah, just leave
the cookin' to me.

12:08.312 --> 12:10.123
Yeah, well, listen, I know
what I'm talkin' about.

12:10.147 --> 12:11.815
I've eaten all over the world.

12:11.899 --> 12:13.400
Been to every country in Epcot.

12:14.652 --> 12:17.029
Dude, get your sweaty hands off my meat.

12:18.322 --> 12:20.950
[both laughing]

12:21.033 --> 12:23.303
I didn't know it when I said
that, but now you think about it...

12:23.327 --> 12:25.138
- Yeah, no, you came around.
- It's kinda gross. Yeah.

12:25.162 --> 12:26.413
Get the fuck out of my kitchen.

12:28.791 --> 12:30.936
Hey, why you got four steaks
and only three place settings?

12:30.960 --> 12:34.213
'Cause Mary's coming over for dinner
and you're eatin' in your room.

12:35.756 --> 12:38.384
- Why?
- Uh, because Mary hates you,

12:38.467 --> 12:41.387
and 'cause Dad hates you, and
'cause I'm not really a big fan.

12:43.013 --> 12:44.139
Ah, whatever.

12:44.223 --> 12:47.226
You know what? When I cook dinner
for Abby, you ain't invited.

12:47.309 --> 12:50.813
[chuckles] Oh, yeah. When you cook
for Abby and Kenny and their 17 kids?

12:52.564 --> 12:54.525
Oh, man, she's gonna break up with him.

12:54.608 --> 12:55.776
Uh-huh.

12:55.859 --> 12:57.194
No. [Stammers] She is, man.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.321
She loved the flours I got for her.

13:01.865 --> 13:03.993
Cost me less than five bucks.

13:05.661 --> 13:07.013
Five bucks? What kind
of flowers did you get?

13:07.037 --> 13:08.664
Unbleached.

13:10.040 --> 13:12.352
Listen, they've been together
for five years. It's complicated.

13:12.376 --> 13:15.796
Plus, Kenny's mom's in town. They're
swapping chicken recipes and shit.

13:15.879 --> 13:19.675
- Oh, yeah? Chicken parm?
- [sighs] Workin' on it.

13:21.051 --> 13:23.345
Well, she said it wasn't
the right time. So...

13:23.887 --> 13:26.265
Oh, honey. Why are the
pretty ones always so dumb?

13:28.017 --> 13:29.393
Did you just call me honey?

13:31.437 --> 13:33.188
I did. And then I called you dumb.

13:34.982 --> 13:36.984
Yeah, but you also called me pretty.

13:39.153 --> 13:41.780
- You remind me of Sarah Roberts.
- Who's that?

13:41.864 --> 13:45.075
The side piece I used to keep around
when I was datin' Jenny Winslow,

13:45.159 --> 13:47.279
just in case things with me
and Jenny didn't work out.

13:47.661 --> 13:51.457
I used to call her Little Caesars,
'cause she was always hot and ready.

13:52.958 --> 13:54.960
Also, she worked at
Little Caesars, so...

13:56.754 --> 13:58.380
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:58.464 --> 14:00.674
You think I'm Abby's Little Caesars?

14:01.633 --> 14:02.843
Man, I'm just sayin'.

14:02.926 --> 14:04.195
It's easier to string somebody along

14:04.219 --> 14:06.096
than it is to break up
an engagement, you know?

14:07.806 --> 14:11.643
- But she said she was going to do it.
- I know, honey. I know.

14:13.896 --> 14:16.774
- Hey, somethin' smells delicious.
- Oh, ho, hey, Mary.

14:17.399 --> 14:19.627
- Oh, hey, Joanne.
- Hey, Rooster, good to see you again.

14:19.651 --> 14:22.780
- [Rooster] Good to see you, too.
- Shithead, what's goin' on?

14:24.114 --> 14:25.908
I'm sorry, have we met?

14:27.284 --> 14:29.387
Uh, will you excuse us for
one second? Can I talk to you?

14:29.411 --> 14:31.705
- Yeah.
- Okay. [Clears throat]

14:32.623 --> 14:35.084
Hey, look. I don't know
what Mary said about me...

14:35.167 --> 14:36.877
That you're a shithead.

14:37.586 --> 14:40.881
Hey, that's not fair. I'm also,
like, really good at football.

14:42.216 --> 14:44.259
What's Joanne doin'
here? You heard my dad.

14:44.343 --> 14:47.303
Yeah, but he said the same thing about
Cracker Barrel, and he enjoyed that.

14:48.639 --> 14:50.891
No, he didn't. He
doesn't enjoy anything.

14:50.974 --> 14:52.726
Except maybe <i>The Rockford Files.</i>

14:54.436 --> 14:55.437
Oh, please.

14:55.521 --> 14:58.690
I think he is open to a lot more
things than y'all give him credit for.

14:58.774 --> 15:02.069
[Beau shouts] Who in the hell
parked a Chevy in my driveway?

15:05.823 --> 15:07.366
She drives a Chevy?

15:07.449 --> 15:08.826
I cannot protect you.

15:13.914 --> 15:15.374
That's my Silverado.

15:15.457 --> 15:19.545
I saw your beat-up old Ford out
there. [Chuckling] It's so cute.

15:21.130 --> 15:24.383
You could put your truck in the back
of my truck. It could go for a ride.

15:26.718 --> 15:29.680
That's funny, Joanne. Why are you here?

15:31.306 --> 15:33.100
Wait, you didn't know
she was comin' over?

15:34.059 --> 15:35.394
Oh, hell, yeah.

15:38.147 --> 15:40.274
I... I hope this is okay.

15:40.357 --> 15:41.442
Of course.

15:41.525 --> 15:44.069
I love having people over. Yay!

15:45.821 --> 15:49.241
Rooster, what do you say
we go fire up the grill?

15:50.284 --> 15:52.619
[chuckles] That's a great idea, Daddy.

15:54.204 --> 15:56.039
I want an open casket.

16:05.048 --> 16:07.843
So, uh, Joanne, you got a
daughter I could date? [Chuckles]

16:18.937 --> 16:22.065
This was not my idea,
okay? Mary just brought her.

16:22.149 --> 16:25.277
I mean, women, right?
[chuckles nervously]

16:25.360 --> 16:28.489
Why would she even try to set me
up like this? I'm still married.

16:28.572 --> 16:32.034
I know. I don't know... Women, right?

16:32.117 --> 16:34.745
Look, Dad, don't look
at it as a setup, okay?

16:34.828 --> 16:36.914
Look at it like Mary just
brought a friend over.

16:36.997 --> 16:39.082
I mean, Joanne seems
like a very nice person.

16:39.166 --> 16:42.419
Son, the woman drives a Chevy.

16:45.047 --> 16:46.381
Yeah, that's a negative.

16:47.299 --> 16:49.801
But let's look at the
positives, okay? She hates Colt.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.739
Look, can't we just go in
there and have a good time?

16:52.763 --> 16:54.473
Come on, Dad, let me see you smile.

16:58.977 --> 17:00.979
Is your mustache just too heavy?

17:10.571 --> 17:12.366
[indistinct chatter]

17:15.953 --> 17:19.957
- Hey, Abby. We need to talk.
- Colt, now is really not a good time.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.684
Yeah, you know why? 'Cause
you're still datin' Kenny.

17:21.708 --> 17:24.147
You know when it will be a good
time? When you're datin' Colt.

17:25.337 --> 17:27.881
- I know what you're saying, but...
- No buts.

17:27.964 --> 17:30.300
I was talking to Rooster... [stammers]

17:32.302 --> 17:34.638
Oh, my God. Is that Kenny's beer?

17:37.099 --> 17:39.226
I'm your Little Caesars.

17:39.851 --> 17:42.396
I don't know what that means,
but I can't do this right now.

17:42.479 --> 17:44.606
No. You know what? I
am your Little Caesars,

17:44.690 --> 17:47.901
'cause I'm all hot and ready,
and you're just wasting this.

17:49.111 --> 17:51.613
You know who wouldn't
waste this? John Elway.

17:53.865 --> 17:57.327
- Are you drunk?
- [stammers] Legally? Yeah, probably.

17:58.370 --> 18:01.582
Uh-oh. Get up for a second, this
guy tries to steal my fiancée.

18:01.665 --> 18:03.333
[all chuckle]

18:04.459 --> 18:08.213
You got a great sense of humor,
Kenny. Just hold on to that.

18:10.048 --> 18:12.694
Hey, I'm gonna get another beer. You
want the same or somethin' different?

18:12.718 --> 18:14.970
Oh, that's a great question, Abby.

18:17.639 --> 18:20.100
I'm just... I'm just saying,
you want the same beer

18:20.183 --> 18:21.727
you've been havin' the whole time,

18:21.810 --> 18:26.064
or you wanna follow your heart
and have a beer with a better body?

18:28.734 --> 18:32.279
To be honest, right now, the
same old thing sounds pretty good.

18:32.362 --> 18:35.365
Yeah, I don't know, sweetie. I like
the sound of that better body beer.

18:36.658 --> 18:39.620
[chuckling] Listen to this guy.

18:39.703 --> 18:41.955
[stammers] He's makin' a lot of sense.

18:42.039 --> 18:44.666
You know what, Kenny...
[stammers] I don't feel great.

18:44.750 --> 18:45.876
I think I'd rather go home.

18:45.959 --> 18:49.463
Okay, yeah, sure. I can stay
here and bro down with Colt.

18:49.546 --> 18:51.340
Actually, why don't
you come home with me?

18:51.423 --> 18:53.592
Sorry, dude. Future wife.
[imitates whip cracking]

18:53.675 --> 18:55.218
[chuckles]

18:55.302 --> 18:58.072
I mean, I'm metaphorically whipped.
We don't do weird stuff in the bedroom.

18:58.096 --> 18:59.931
- Kenny, stop talking.
- Yeah, sorry.

19:00.015 --> 19:02.851
Look, you... You know, I get
it. It's no problem. [Stammers]

19:02.934 --> 19:04.478
I heard that your mom's in town.

19:04.561 --> 19:08.231
If... If you need somebody to give her a
ride to the airport, so you guys can...

19:08.315 --> 19:10.075
I don't know, talk about
somethin' important,

19:10.108 --> 19:11.276
I... I'm available.

19:11.360 --> 19:12.694
Wow, thanks.

19:12.778 --> 19:15.864
Uh, she's got the flu and she's
gonna stay for a few more days.

19:15.947 --> 19:17.199
Son of a bitch.

19:22.037 --> 19:25.332
- Dinner's ready.
- Well, you've been out there a while.

19:25.415 --> 19:28.001
Either you're avoiding us, or
those steaks are overcooked.

19:29.252 --> 19:30.962
Steaks are rare.

19:33.423 --> 19:35.926
So, Beau, you know, uh,
Joanne used to be a rancher.

19:36.802 --> 19:39.096
- Really?
- Yep, my whole life.

19:39.179 --> 19:41.682
Then one day my husband
decided he wanted to sell.

19:41.765 --> 19:43.767
We got some pretty decent money for it,

19:43.850 --> 19:46.478
but we needed something
to fill our time, so...

19:46.561 --> 19:48.230
I got a job at the Cracker Barrel

19:48.313 --> 19:51.608
and Roger got herpes from a
27-year-old flight attendant.

19:51.692 --> 19:53.568
[chuckles] Herpes, huh?

19:53.652 --> 19:55.195
Top or bottom?

19:58.740 --> 19:59.950
Not important.

20:02.494 --> 20:05.872
What kind of a rancher sells his ranch?

20:05.956 --> 20:09.418
- You're better off without him.
- Oh, well, I'll drink to that.

20:09.501 --> 20:11.104
Course, I'll drink to
just about anything.

20:11.128 --> 20:13.171
[chuckles] Hey, I'll drink to that.

20:14.798 --> 20:17.926
So, uh, Beau, I hear
you're recently separated.

20:19.386 --> 20:21.972
- I'm not sure where you heard that...
- Mary.

20:24.224 --> 20:27.352
I usually don't talk about my
personal life with strangers.

20:27.436 --> 20:30.188
Well, now, that is true. First
time he came into Cracker Barrel,

20:30.272 --> 20:31.708
I asked him if he was
allergic to anything.

20:31.732 --> 20:33.275
He said, "Yeah. Small talk."

20:33.358 --> 20:34.818
[all laugh]

20:35.527 --> 20:37.779
I get it. Tough guy.

20:37.863 --> 20:41.241
Doesn't need help from anybody.
Watches too many bad John Wayne movies.

20:47.956 --> 20:50.834
Did you just say "bad
John Wayne movies"?

20:52.002 --> 20:54.671
The man had one look. You
can hardly call that acting.

20:54.755 --> 20:56.423
If it's the right look...

20:57.340 --> 20:58.925
you don't need more than one.

21:04.806 --> 21:08.226
So, Joanne, um, you like
<i>The Rockford Files?</i>

21:08.310 --> 21:09.811
- Hate 'em.
- Oh, shit.

21:11.313 --> 21:13.857
So, uh, Joanne, you still
going huntin' this weekend?

21:13.940 --> 21:15.942
- Oh, you bet.
- [Rooster] Oh, that's cool.

21:16.026 --> 21:18.129
We love huntin'. You see that
buck Dad shot, down there?

21:18.153 --> 21:19.873
Yeah, what'd you bring
that down with, Beau?

21:20.363 --> 21:23.200
Winchester, model 70. Hmm.

21:23.283 --> 21:25.702
- That gun is like a son to me.
- [Rooster chuckles]

21:25.786 --> 21:28.079
I'm proud to call that
rifle a brother, Daddy.

21:28.163 --> 21:29.164
[Mary chuckles]

21:29.247 --> 21:31.917
Yeah, I guess I pictured
you on foot with a bow,

21:32.000 --> 21:36.087
not sitting up in some cozy stand,
picking 'em off from a quarter mile away.

21:37.756 --> 21:38.799
That's funny.

21:39.716 --> 21:42.719
I pictured you eatin' dinner
somewhere else tonight.

21:46.097 --> 21:49.059
You say your wife left
you. Can't imagine why.

21:52.979 --> 21:55.440
So Colt's a real shithead, isn't he?

22:03.156 --> 22:05.283
[country music playing on radio]

22:07.744 --> 22:08.995
[Colt] What's up?

22:09.079 --> 22:10.789
- How was dinner?
- [chuckles]

22:11.706 --> 22:14.292
Joanne told Dad he wasn't a real hunter,

22:14.376 --> 22:16.962
and then she started talkin'
shit about John Wayne.

22:17.045 --> 22:19.172
- Whoa.
- How was your night?

22:19.256 --> 22:22.634
Oh, well, seems Kenny's
mom's got the flu...

22:23.218 --> 22:26.012
Selfish bitch. [Sighs]

22:27.180 --> 22:30.934
I think you're right. I
think Abby's got me on hold.

22:32.310 --> 22:33.478
What you gonna do?

22:35.272 --> 22:36.565
I don't know.

22:37.774 --> 22:40.735
Best thing's probably just
avoid each other for a while.

22:40.819 --> 22:42.153
Let things cool off.

22:42.237 --> 22:45.240
Yeah. That's what I would do.

22:45.323 --> 22:48.535
- It's gonna be tough, though.
- Why's that?

22:49.327 --> 22:50.870
'Cause Abby's coming down the drive.

22:53.290 --> 22:54.791
Godspeed, Little Caesars.

23:00.338 --> 23:02.257
What the hell was that, Colt?

23:02.340 --> 23:05.427
Hey, Abby. You need help
buryin' the body, let me know.

23:05.510 --> 23:07.804
- Shut up, Rooster.
- All right, good talk.

23:10.098 --> 23:12.559
Where do you get off saying
those things in front of Kenny?

23:13.143 --> 23:14.662
Oh, what's the worst
thing that's gonna happen?

23:14.686 --> 23:16.330
He's gonna find out you're
gonna break up with him,

23:16.354 --> 23:17.480
get pissed and dump you?

23:18.023 --> 23:21.359
[scoffs] Winner, winner,
chicken parm dinner.

23:21.443 --> 23:23.820
The world doesn't
revolve around you, Colt.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.155
I'll do it when I'm ready.

23:25.238 --> 23:27.949
Really? When's that gonna be?

23:28.033 --> 23:30.368
After you have beers
with him at my mom's bar?

23:30.452 --> 23:32.954
I mean, you got a new excuse
every time. What's next?

23:33.038 --> 23:35.850
[stammers] "Wait till I get married to
him, and then I'll break up with him"?

23:35.874 --> 23:37.125
It's not that easy, okay?

23:37.208 --> 23:40.170
When you've been datin' someone this
long, your lives get intertwined.

23:40.253 --> 23:43.131
I mean, I'm a bridesmaid
in his sister's wedding.

23:43.214 --> 23:44.758
We have his corporate retreat.

23:44.841 --> 23:48.428
We're on the same cell phone plan. I'm
eligible for a new iPhone in a month!

23:48.511 --> 23:52.474
Those are all excuses! Why
is this so hard for you?

23:52.557 --> 23:54.768
Huh? You didn't have any
problem breaking up with me.

23:54.851 --> 23:56.186
It took about 30 seconds.

23:56.936 --> 23:58.605
That was high school.

23:58.688 --> 24:01.149
But you know what, I don't
expect you to understand.

24:01.232 --> 24:02.835
I mean, you haven't even
been in an adult relationship.

24:02.859 --> 24:06.237
Abby, I'm trying to be in one right now,
except it doesn't seem like you want that.

24:06.321 --> 24:08.990
- You just don't get it.
- No, I think I get it just fine!

24:09.074 --> 24:12.285
You told me you wanted to be with me
and you were gonna break up with him.

24:12.369 --> 24:13.804
Except neither one of
those things has happened.

24:13.828 --> 24:15.388
It's either you're too scared to do it,

24:15.455 --> 24:17.141
or you were never gonna
do it in the first place.

24:17.165 --> 24:18.976
I'm not gonna let you
bully me into this, Colt.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.145
Nah, you know what, fuck it. You
just... You go do what you want.

24:21.169 --> 24:23.546
Really? "Fuck it"? Fuck you.

24:39.396 --> 24:41.231
[vehicle approaching]

24:53.368 --> 24:54.452
Hey, Beau.

24:55.286 --> 24:58.373
Oh, good, you stopped
by unannounced again.

24:58.456 --> 24:59.666
[chuckles]

24:59.749 --> 25:03.044
You know how to fix a Ford,
right? You buy a Chevy.

25:05.004 --> 25:06.089
Oh, it still works.

25:06.172 --> 25:08.466
Here, lay down in front
of it, I'll show you.

25:11.136 --> 25:12.804
What are you doin' here, Joanne?

25:13.430 --> 25:16.099
Well, I could've handled
myself better at dinner.

25:16.182 --> 25:19.394
And we never made it to dessert,
so I baked you an apple pie.

25:20.895 --> 25:23.898
Feel free to say you were an ass, too.

25:24.899 --> 25:28.027
- Let me taste the pie first.
- Fair enough.

25:28.111 --> 25:29.404
What's the whiskey for?

25:29.487 --> 25:31.906
Oh, I like good whiskey.
Yours is all cheap.

25:31.990 --> 25:34.534
Oh, I have good whiskey.

25:34.617 --> 25:36.453
I only serve it to people I like.

25:36.536 --> 25:38.163
[chuckles]

25:42.584 --> 25:44.252
This is good pie.

25:44.335 --> 25:46.588
- And so is the whiskey.
- I know.

25:47.255 --> 25:49.799
I took half of Roger's
money and all of his booze.

25:52.010 --> 25:53.136
Smart.

25:54.220 --> 25:57.474
You know, I suppose I do owe
you an apology for last night.

25:58.475 --> 26:01.811
I'm not a big fan of
people comin' into my house,

26:01.895 --> 26:05.940
'cause you gotta say stupid things
like, "Can I get you anything?"

26:08.276 --> 26:10.653
By the way, Joanne,
can I get you anything?

26:13.907 --> 26:15.325
I know how you feel.

26:15.408 --> 26:17.202
For a while there, I
hated everybody, too.

26:17.285 --> 26:20.497
But what are you gonna do? Hide
from everyone until you die alone?

26:20.580 --> 26:21.956
That's the plan.

26:24.042 --> 26:26.878
Come on. You can't mean that.

26:26.961 --> 26:29.214
Don't you want to live
to see your grandchildren?

26:29.297 --> 26:30.924
Little Roosters?

26:32.217 --> 26:34.093
Little Shitheads?

26:36.638 --> 26:39.015
I thought you was trying
to give me reasons to live.

26:39.098 --> 26:40.099
[Joanne chuckles]

26:42.227 --> 26:44.103
You know, I've been where you are, Beau.

26:44.813 --> 26:47.273
After my divorce, I went to
Laughlin and I played Keno

26:47.357 --> 26:49.277
and drank whiskey for
about four months straight.

26:49.317 --> 26:51.319
I spent so much time being mad

26:51.402 --> 26:53.404
that I couldn't see how
much better off I was.

26:53.488 --> 26:56.241
And if I wasted so much
time when I was with Roger,

26:56.324 --> 26:58.827
I was not gonna waste
any more time without him.

26:58.910 --> 27:03.915
Not when there's things
to do, and pie to eat

27:03.998 --> 27:06.543
and John Wayne movies to avoid.

27:12.549 --> 27:14.425
What made you realize all that?

27:15.552 --> 27:16.636
I swear to God...

27:17.554 --> 27:19.639
I'm sittin' at the bar,
and I'm playin' video poker,

27:19.722 --> 27:24.102
and I suddenly hear this low,
strange sound. And I look over,

27:24.185 --> 27:26.020
and the woman next to me

27:26.104 --> 27:30.483
has keeled over and died,
facedown in a bowl of crab legs.

27:31.901 --> 27:34.028
And I decide two things.

27:34.112 --> 27:38.700
Live every day like it's your last and
stay the fuck away from the crab legs.

27:40.618 --> 27:41.870
[chuckles]

27:41.953 --> 27:44.247
Well, if today was my last day,

27:44.330 --> 27:47.709
there are worse ways to spend it
than eating pie and drinking whiskey.

27:49.210 --> 27:51.170
Course, talking to
someone kinda ruins it.

27:51.254 --> 27:52.505
[Joanne chuckles]

27:54.757 --> 27:55.842
[sighs]

27:55.925 --> 27:57.969
Don't close every door, Beau.

27:58.052 --> 28:00.346
There's still good people in this world.

28:00.930 --> 28:04.851
And when you find a connection that
works, gotta take advantage of it.

28:04.934 --> 28:07.562
Even if they are
cantankerous old bastards.

28:09.731 --> 28:11.441
Or uninvited guests.

28:14.861 --> 28:17.989
- Can I ask you somethin'?
- Sure.

28:18.740 --> 28:21.117
You seem like such a nice woman.

28:22.118 --> 28:24.579
Why in the world would
you drive a Chevy?

28:30.501 --> 28:32.045
[knocking on door]

28:36.007 --> 28:37.300
Oh, shit.

28:38.426 --> 28:39.844
Who's that?

28:41.888 --> 28:42.972
My wife.

28:46.434 --> 28:48.436
