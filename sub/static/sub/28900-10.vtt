‐(suspenseful music
playing on computer)

00:18.060 --> 00:20.270
Hello? Hi.

00:20.270 --> 00:21.810
How many more
of these scary movies

00:21.810 --> 00:23.560
are you guys planning
on watching tonight?

00:25.100 --> 00:26.810
‐Is that a body bag?
‐It's a bag.

00:26.810 --> 00:28.400
We don't know
if it's a body bag.

00:28.400 --> 00:30.690
‐(zipping)
‐(all gasp)

00:30.690 --> 00:32.860
‐Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's a body bag.
‐Yeah.

00:33.700 --> 00:36.370
Yo, we're watching
the Wes Carpenter
Horror Movie Cringe Binge.

00:36.370 --> 00:40.120
We're on <i>The People Upstairs,</i>
<i>Part One: The Move‐In.</i>

00:40.120 --> 00:42.250
Lon Hanks is trying
to find out more about

00:42.250 --> 00:44.960
his mysterious
new neighbors, the Ghoulardis.

00:44.960 --> 00:48.920
All this movie talk
is giving me a splitting...
headache.

00:48.920 --> 00:53.170
Um, maybe your
hatchet headband
is on too tight.

00:54.470 --> 00:56.590
What? Come on, you guys
didn't even look at me!

00:56.590 --> 00:58.260
We're horror movie pros, Nia.

00:58.260 --> 01:00.720
We've seen everything
from <i>Oklahoma Weed Whacker</i>

01:00.720 --> 01:02.270
to <i>Bad Dream on Oak Street.</i>

01:02.270 --> 01:06.100
Yeah. I mean,
there's nothing you
could do to scare us.

01:06.100 --> 01:08.110
We're like, un‐scareable.

01:08.110 --> 01:10.570
‐(Raven and Chelsea screaming)

01:10.570 --> 01:14.070
‐Ha! Ha‐ha! Ha!
‐(Raven laughing)

01:14.070 --> 01:16.280
You don't look
un‐scareable to me.

01:16.280 --> 01:18.280
No, you don't.
We gotcha!

(laughing)

02:17.220 --> 02:19.340
(laughs) Good morning,
sleepy head.

02:19.340 --> 02:22.640
Did <i>The People Upstairs</i>
movie marathon
keep you up all night?

02:22.640 --> 02:25.140
No, it wasn't the marathon.

02:25.140 --> 02:27.180
It was the actual
people upstairs.

02:27.180 --> 02:29.650
‐What?
‐I mean, who moves in
in the middle of the night?

02:29.650 --> 02:31.230
Well, that's what the Segers did

02:31.230 --> 02:34.150
in <i>The People Upstairs</i>
<i>Part Two: Night Movers.</i>

02:34.150 --> 02:36.650
Yeah, well, some people
are more productive at night,
you know?

02:36.650 --> 02:38.530
Some people are more productive
in the morning.

02:38.530 --> 02:41.490
Me, I'm, I'm more between
like eleven and noon.

02:43.370 --> 02:46.410
(yawning): Actually,
I'm kind of drowsy right now.

02:48.620 --> 02:51.830
Wow. Aunt Chels, where'd
you get these fake cobwebs?

02:51.830 --> 02:54.540
‐I mean, they look so real.
‐Yeah, yeah. They are.

02:54.540 --> 02:56.250
(clears throat)

02:56.250 --> 02:59.170
I usually stop dusting
six weeks before Halloween.

03:00.130 --> 03:03.050
I call them
"organic decorations."

03:04.140 --> 03:06.470
Well, I, for one,
cannot wait for tonight.

03:06.470 --> 03:08.480
‐I love Halloween.
‐(door clatters open)

03:09.730 --> 03:11.600
Trick or feed me.

03:11.600 --> 03:14.060
Oh, all right!
I got you covered.
(gasps)

03:14.060 --> 03:16.110
Try my new veggie candy.

03:16.110 --> 03:17.780
I've mastered
entrees and desserts,

03:17.780 --> 03:19.400
so I've moved on
to Halloween treats.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.610
(clears throat)
Okay, try this one.

03:21.610 --> 03:23.950
This is called, uh,
black bean taffy.

03:23.950 --> 03:26.240
Yeah, I like to keep
my veggies veggies,

03:26.240 --> 03:29.370
and my candies candies,
so I'm gonna pass pass.

03:30.330 --> 03:31.290
So...

03:31.290 --> 03:32.920
rain check, rain check?

03:34.130 --> 03:35.880
Speaking of
raining checks,

03:35.880 --> 03:39.090
it's about to with
my new luxury Scut,
the Trenta XL.

03:39.090 --> 03:41.720
Okay, so,
I had to give my car
to the dealership,

03:41.720 --> 03:43.090
and they said they needed
to keep it for a week,

03:43.090 --> 03:44.890
so they gave me a loaner.
Check this out!

03:44.890 --> 03:47.510
‐What?
‐(all gasping)

03:47.510 --> 03:49.430
That is a dope ride.

03:49.430 --> 03:52.060
I mean, it's choking the planet,
but it's fancy.

03:53.190 --> 03:56.150
Maybe you can take
some of these Halloween treats
for your passengers.

03:57.270 --> 03:58.690
‐Oh, yeah.
‐(kids groaning)

03:58.690 --> 03:59.690
‐No.
‐That's, uh,

03:59.690 --> 04:01.450
‐that's a great idea.
‐Oh!

04:01.450 --> 04:03.070
‐Why don't you go
get me some more?
‐Okay!

04:03.070 --> 04:04.610
‐Go get some‐‐
‐Yeah.

04:08.160 --> 04:10.000
(knocking on door)

04:12.120 --> 04:15.080
‐Hey. I'm Darnell,
your new neighbor in 4B.
‐Hi.

04:15.080 --> 04:16.590
Oh, hi. (chuckles)

04:16.590 --> 04:18.800
‐Hi, I, I, I'm Chelsea.
(giggles)
‐Hi.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.090
I just wanted to apologize
for making so much noise
last night.

04:21.090 --> 04:24.010
Oh, my goodness.
That is so kind of you.

04:24.010 --> 04:25.680
‐(oven timer dings)
‐(gasps) Oh, hold on.
Let me just‐‐

04:25.680 --> 04:27.390
I need to get this
out of the oven real quick.

04:27.390 --> 04:28.760
(shrieks)

04:33.350 --> 04:35.020
Come in.

04:35.020 --> 04:38.150
Thank you. I, I certainly
wasn't going to enter
without an invitation.

04:38.150 --> 04:40.820
‐(Chelsea chuckles)
‐Oh. Who's this little guy?

04:40.820 --> 04:42.650
Oh. This is my son, Levi.

04:42.650 --> 04:44.490
‐Nice to meet you.
‐Mm‐hmm.

04:44.490 --> 04:46.450
Wow. Your hands are cold.

04:46.450 --> 04:49.280
I was putting away groceries,
a lot of frozen goods.

04:49.280 --> 04:50.620
I like to...

04:51.950 --> 04:53.120
stock up.

04:53.120 --> 04:55.420
Why'd you pause
before "stock up"?

04:55.420 --> 04:57.080
Did I pause before...

04:57.080 --> 04:58.960
"stock up"?

04:58.960 --> 05:01.210
Okay, now you're doing it
on purpose.

05:01.210 --> 05:03.970
So, uh, where are you from,
Darnell? East Coast?

05:03.970 --> 05:07.300
West Coast? My, uh...
my dreams? (chuckles)

05:07.300 --> 05:08.800
Subtle, Mom.

05:09.550 --> 05:11.310
(laughs)
Would you like to try

05:11.310 --> 05:13.680
some of my
homemade kale fudge?

05:13.680 --> 05:15.230
‐Sure.
‐Okay.

05:15.230 --> 05:17.060
‐What do you think?
‐Hmm.

05:17.060 --> 05:19.440
‐A little vanilla.
‐A little vanilla.

05:20.860 --> 05:24.320
‐Cream of tartar.
‐Cream of tartar.

05:25.740 --> 05:28.030
Agave instead of sugar.

05:28.030 --> 05:32.240
Agave instead of sugar.
Nope, that's not in this.

05:32.240 --> 05:34.120
I don't know why I'm
repeating everything
you're saying.

05:34.120 --> 05:35.370
‐(laughs)
‐Oh!

05:35.370 --> 05:38.170
‐I sometimes have
that effect on people.
‐(Chelsea laughs)

05:38.170 --> 05:39.380
(camera shutter clicks)

05:41.210 --> 05:43.420
Hello, luxurious one.
I'm Raven.

05:43.420 --> 05:45.260
I'll be driving you for a week.

05:46.220 --> 05:48.180
These seats are a little cold.

05:48.180 --> 05:49.850
(low buzzing)

05:49.850 --> 05:52.140
Did the seat warmers
just turn on?

05:52.140 --> 05:54.020
Oh, yeah. Yes, they did.

05:55.770 --> 05:57.060
(chuckles)

05:58.480 --> 05:59.600
(gasps)

05:59.600 --> 06:01.110
Well, Mama likes.

06:01.110 --> 06:03.110
(whirs)

06:03.110 --> 06:04.990
(seat whirs)

06:04.990 --> 06:07.610
Wow. Okay.

06:07.610 --> 06:10.240
Well, all I need now
is for my coffee to be warm.

06:10.240 --> 06:11.950
‐(chuckles)
‐(sips)

06:13.240 --> 06:15.120
Did you just
warm this up for me?

06:15.700 --> 06:16.910
(sips)

06:18.040 --> 06:19.370
Heaven.

06:22.290 --> 06:25.460
Hi. I'm Raven.
I'll be your Scut driver.

06:25.460 --> 06:27.670
Welcome to your
luxurious Scut ride.

06:29.050 --> 06:30.720
(clears throat)

06:30.720 --> 06:33.050
Can I offer you some tune‐skies?

06:33.050 --> 06:36.180
We have, uh, R&B,
oldies, a little country.

06:36.180 --> 06:37.890
(radio screeches, crackles)

06:38.730 --> 06:41.560
Sorry. I don't know
what's going on
with the radio.

06:41.560 --> 06:43.150
(soft guitar music playing)

06:43.150 --> 06:45.110
Oh, this is my favorite song.

06:46.150 --> 06:50.740
Oh. Wow.
It's, it's like the car
can read your mind.

06:50.740 --> 06:53.160
(music continuing)

06:56.580 --> 06:59.410
He didn't come into
the apartment until
he was invited in,

06:59.410 --> 07:01.040
and he hypnotized my mom.

07:01.040 --> 07:06.170
She was all,
"Vanilla. Agave.
Cream of tartar."

07:06.800 --> 07:09.170
Levi.
(sighs)

07:09.170 --> 07:11.470
See. He looks
like a normal guy.

07:11.470 --> 07:13.510
I mean,
a little blurry, but...

07:25.190 --> 07:28.230
Levi, I just had a vision
of Aunt Chelsea and Darnell.

07:28.230 --> 07:30.240
‐She's in danger.
‐What are we dealing with?

07:30.240 --> 07:32.450
A werewolf?
A vampire?

07:32.450 --> 07:33.820
A dentist?!

07:33.820 --> 07:35.160
I don't know.

07:35.160 --> 07:38.240
But whatever it is,
Darnell is definitely
some kind of monster.

07:38.240 --> 07:40.290
Wow. That horror movie
cringe binge

07:40.290 --> 07:41.830
is making you two paranoid.

07:41.830 --> 07:43.290
Uh, no, no, no.

07:43.290 --> 07:45.790
That cringe binge
has made us vigilant.

07:45.790 --> 07:47.710
We can't let our guard down
for a second.

07:47.710 --> 07:50.220
Otherwise, Aunt Chelsea
will end up like
the maintenance man

07:50.220 --> 07:54.050
from <i>The People Upstairs Three:</i>
<i>The Jack O' Landlord.</i>

07:54.050 --> 07:57.140
Spoiler alert, bruh.
I haven't seen that one yet.

07:57.140 --> 07:59.020
And I don't think
it's a coincidence

07:59.020 --> 08:01.520
‐that he moved in
the night before Halloween.
‐Right.

08:01.520 --> 08:03.690
Darnell probably knows
that most of the adults

08:03.690 --> 08:05.110
in this building leave,

08:05.110 --> 08:07.150
because they don't want
to be bothered by
trick‐or‐treaters.

08:07.150 --> 08:10.280
And that gives him
a quiet place to feed
on unsuspecting kids.

08:10.280 --> 08:13.030
And the single mom
who hands out
healthy treats.

08:14.740 --> 08:16.830
I, I don't write these movies.

08:17.910 --> 08:20.910
♪ ♪

08:20.910 --> 08:23.250
Whoo!
Break time is over.

08:23.250 --> 08:26.080
Back to driving my fancy,
luxury Scut. Ah.

08:26.080 --> 08:28.040
You know what, Chel?
I know you used to be rich,
but...

08:28.040 --> 08:30.050
you've never experienced
luxury like this.

08:30.050 --> 08:31.090
Mm!

08:31.090 --> 08:32.630
See anything?

08:32.630 --> 08:35.010
Yeah, I see everything,
but no Darnell.

08:35.010 --> 08:37.100
Uh, what are you two up to?

08:38.140 --> 08:40.350
(both scream)

08:41.520 --> 08:44.730
Oh, uh, you know. We're just,
just bird‐watching. (chuckles)

08:44.730 --> 08:46.270
Bird‐watching?

08:46.270 --> 08:49.110
It's October in Chicago.

08:49.110 --> 08:51.480
There are no birds.
They all flew south.

08:51.480 --> 08:54.780
Oh. Uh, well, we thought
they flew to the South Side.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.700
Nope, nope.
Not gonna touch that.
I'm having a good day.

08:59.700 --> 09:03.000
I don't feel like
listening to that.
All right. Bye!

09:04.160 --> 09:05.370
Whoa.

09:05.370 --> 09:07.500
That was spooky, Ms. B.
It's like‐‐

09:07.500 --> 09:09.290
It's like you knew I was here.

09:12.210 --> 09:14.050
You're always here, Tess.

09:16.180 --> 09:18.800
Hey, Levi.
You wanna try one of these...

09:18.800 --> 09:20.470
macaroons?

09:21.390 --> 09:22.970
Mom, you're not
supposed to wink

09:22.970 --> 09:24.600
at the person you're
trying to trick.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.850
Oh. All right. Fine.

09:26.850 --> 09:29.190
You wanna eat
these potatoes,
no wink?

09:30.270 --> 09:32.360
I'll pass. We're gonna go
look out the window

09:32.360 --> 09:33.780
‐in Tess's apartment.
‐Huh?

09:33.780 --> 09:35.490
Right, Tess?

09:38.450 --> 09:40.370
I, I don't know what's going on,

09:40.370 --> 09:41.950
but sure. Why not?
