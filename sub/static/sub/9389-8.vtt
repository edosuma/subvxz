No, I don't.

09:19.101 --> 09:20.394
Yes, you do.

09:20.477 --> 09:21.562
No, I don't!

09:21.645 --> 09:22.813
Yes, you do!

09:22.896 --> 09:23.939
Okay, yes.

09:24.022 --> 09:25.148
See that?

09:25.232 --> 09:28.068
Fifty nos and a yes means yes.

Hi.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.409
So how'd the medical
experiments go?

09:35.492 --> 09:36.618
So good, Lois.

09:36.702 --> 09:37.911
So good.

Peter, what exactly
did they inject you with?

09:45.169 --> 09:46.420
Oh, all sorts of things.

09:46.503 --> 09:48.755
Hepatitis vaccine,
a couple of steroids,

09:48.839 --> 09:50.799
the gay gene, calcium,
a vitamin B extract...

09:50.883 --> 09:52.050
What did you just say?

09:52.134 --> 09:53.177
The gay gene.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.720
I assume that's
the one you meant,

09:54.803 --> 09:56.638
even though it wasn't literally
the last thing I said

09:56.722 --> 09:58.056
when you said,
"What did you just say?"

09:58.140 --> 09:59.766
It's just that clearly
it was the most unusual.

09:59.850 --> 10:01.018
Yes, that's the one I meant.

10:01.101 --> 10:04.688
Peter, are you... gay?

10:26.627 --> 10:28.587
I wish I was Beyoncé.

10:28.670 --> 10:30.297
Peter, I think maybe
you should go back

10:30.380 --> 10:32.716
and have that doctor
undo whatever he did.

10:37.638 --> 10:38.889

Well, it wasn't the muffin fairy.

10:40.933 --> 10:42.059
Or was it?

-Peter...

10:46.230 --> 10:48.190
Try it.

10:48.273 --> 10:49.775
Dad, I think Mom's right.

10:49.858 --> 10:51.360
Maybe you should go back
to that doctor.

10:51.443 --> 10:52.945
Well, now, wait a minute, Meg.

10:53.028 --> 10:54.780
Let's not be too hasty.

10:54.863 --> 10:56.532
These are delicious!

10:56.907 --> 10:58.700
(MUMBLES) I know what you mean.

10:58.784 --> 11:00.035
What?

11:00.118 --> 11:01.912
I said homosexuality
is wrong.

11:01.995 --> 11:04.039
Are you... Are you
being serious right now?

11:04.122 --> 11:05.916
Just keep it in the bedroom, you know?

11:05.999 --> 11:08.544
I mean, I'm not all
in your face with my heterosexuality.

11:08.627 --> 11:10.295

What's the problem, champ?

11:17.135 --> 11:19.513
Why is math so hard?

11:19.596 --> 11:20.973
Well, you know,
it doesn't have to be.

11:21.056 --> 11:22.224
One trick I used to use

11:22.307 --> 11:23.892
is turning things
into a word problem.

11:23.976 --> 11:26.520
For example,
if there are three glory holes

11:26.603 --> 11:28.063
in the bathroom at the club,

11:28.146 --> 11:29.982
and 28 guys at the circuit party,

11:30.065 --> 11:32.150
how many rotations
of guys will it take

11:32.234 --> 11:33.986
before everybody's had a turn?

11:34.069 --> 11:35.070
I don't know.

11:35.153 --> 11:36.655
Nine, with a remainder of Brent.

11:36.738 --> 11:38.323
Oh!

11:38.407 --> 11:40.284
'Cause Brent can't fit
in the glory hole

11:40.367 --> 11:42.202
And that's why we all like Brent

did you reach a missile pact?

work that way.

to have to get used to this

Before anyone gets too worked up,
I know where Peter is.

17:58.203 --> 18:00.163
-Where?
-I put him in a Straight Camp.

18:00.247 --> 18:02.541
-You what?
-Oh! You bastard!

18:02.624 --> 18:04.626
Brian, why...
Why did you do that?

18:04.710 --> 18:06.837
Well, it's just that
you seem so unhappy,

18:06.920 --> 18:09.590
and I just wanted to help you
get your husband back.

18:09.673 --> 18:10.841
Who knows? By now,

18:10.924 --> 18:12.968
Peter could be completely
heterosexual again.

18:13.051 --> 18:14.970
(MUSIC PLAYING)

18:15.053 --> 18:17.472
(SINGING) Throw out your hands
Stick out your tush

18:17.556 --> 18:19.766
Hands on your hips
Give 'em a push

18:19.850 --> 18:21.977
You'll be surprised
you'redoing The French Mistake

18:23.270 --> 18:24.396
LOIS: Stop!

18:24.479 --> 18:26.940
Lois! What are
you doing here?

18:27.024 --> 18:29.109
I'm here to get you out
of this place, Peter.

18:29.193 --> 18:31.069
I'm taking you back to Scott.

18:31.153 --> 18:34.615
Really? You're not still
upset about my leaving?

18:34.698 --> 18:37.284
Peter, there's nothing I'd want
more than to have you back,

18:37.367 --> 18:39.828
but your place is in Scott now.

18:39.912 --> 18:43.248
I mean, a person's sexual identity
is no more a choice

18:43.332 --> 18:44.958
than the color of his skin.

18:45.042 --> 18:47.002
This is who you are.

18:47.085 --> 18:48.837
I can't change you.

18:48.921 --> 18:51.131
And it would be wrong
for me to try.

18:51.215 --> 18:55.093
Oh, Lois, you've made me happier
than a pig among guinea pigs.

18:56.637 --> 18:58.555
All right,
I think we're all in agreement.

18:58.639 --> 19:00.224
I'm in charge here.

19:04.061 --> 19:05.562
Hi, Peter!

19:05.646 --> 19:07.397
Hi, Scott!

19:08.440 --> 19:09.733
Guess what?

19:09.816 --> 19:11.902
I have a welcome-home
surprise for you.

19:11.985 --> 19:13.862
Dish, dish, dish!

19:13.946 --> 19:15.280
Remember how you told me

19:15.364 --> 19:17.824
your ultimate fantasy
was to have an 11-way?

19:17.908 --> 19:20.536
Oh, my God! Yes, I do.
And you so did not even.

19:20.619 --> 19:22.120
Oh, but I did.

19:22.204 --> 19:24.081
Yoo-hoo! Guys!

19:26.416 --> 19:27.501
(SQUEAKS)

19:29.795 --> 19:32.005
Oh! Here are my notes
about the gay gene.

19:32.172 --> 19:35.592
Huh. It wears off after
two-and-a-half weeks.

19:35.676 --> 19:38.929
Oh, great! Now I can't find
Mrs. Griffin's number!

19:39.096 --> 19:41.265
SCOTT: Okay, everybody ready?

19:41.348 --> 19:43.684
PETER: Oh, God!
I feel like a kid in a candy store

19:43.767 --> 19:46.186
who's having sex
with a bunch of gay guys.

19:46.270 --> 19:50.190
(ALL MOANING)

19:50.274 --> 19:52.985
ALL: Ooh! Ooh! (LAUGHING)

19:53.068 --> 19:55.696
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

19:55.779 --> 19:56.905
PETER: Wait a minute.

19:56.989 --> 19:59.032
What's going on here?

19:59.741 --> 20:01.368
Holy crap!

20:01.451 --> 20:04.705
(SCREAMING)

20:04.788 --> 20:06.164
These are mine!

20:06.248 --> 20:07.833
(SCREAMING)

20:12.296 --> 20:15.299
So we're just, like, never going to talk
about this again?

20:15.382 --> 20:16.842
That's right, sweetie.

20:16.925 --> 20:19.553
Well, I'm just happy
to have your father home again.

20:19.636 --> 20:23.098
Yeah. And thank God
everything's back to normal.

20:23.182 --> 20:25.893
MAN: Take back your (BLEEP) horse!

20:27.519 --> 20:29.521
