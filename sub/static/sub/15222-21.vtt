00:01.668 --> 00:05.764
<i>Theorizing that one could time travel
within his own lifetime,</i>

00:05.839 --> 00:08.774
<i>Dr. Sam Beckett stepped
into the Quantum Leap accelerator...</i>

00:08.842 --> 00:10.833
<i>and vanished.</i>

00:15.515 --> 00:18.075
<i>He awoke to find himself
trapped in the past,</i>

00:18.151 --> 00:21.678
<i>facing mirror images
that were not his own...</i>

00:21.755 --> 00:26.988
<i>and driven by an unknown force
to change history for the better.</i>

00:27.060 --> 00:32.327
<i>His only guide on this journey is Al,
an observer from his own time,</i>

00:32.399 --> 00:36.768
<i>who appears in the form of a hologram
that only Sam can see and hear.</i>

00:36.836 --> 00:41.000
<i>And so, Dr. Beckett finds himself
leaping from life to life,</i>

00:41.074 --> 00:44.009
<i>striving to put right
what once went wrong...</i>

00:44.077 --> 00:46.739
<i>and hoping each time
that his next leap...</i>

00:46.813 --> 00:48.804
<i>will be the leap home.</i>

00:53.653 --> 00:56.121
Get on down there! Move it!
What's goin' on?

00:56.189 --> 00:59.124
Find out soon enough, boy.
Huh?

00:59.192 --> 01:03.629
You need a little trim, Elvis.
Elvis?

01:05.698 --> 01:07.893
Oh, boy.

Uh, look, guys, I-I think if we
just discuss this,

02:25.378 --> 02:28.472
<i>if we, you know, uh, talk about this,
we can work it all out.</i>

02:28.548 --> 02:30.482
Is that what you're thinkin'?
Yeah.

02:30.550 --> 02:33.678
<i>We should take a little off the top first.
Maybe I ought to take some off your top first.</i>

02:41.461 --> 02:43.861
On your feet!

02:43.930 --> 02:48.060
We ain't through with you yet!
I'm all shook up!

02:48.134 --> 02:51.001
Will you quit pickin' fights?
Huh?

02:51.070 --> 02:54.096
L- I-I didn't pick that fight.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.199
But I want to thank you
for your help though.

02:56.276 --> 02:58.506
Thanks for your help?
Yeah.

02:58.578 --> 03:02.844
Since when don't I help you? Well,
I mean, thanks for your help again.

03:02.916 --> 03:05.043
Again. All the time.
Yeah.

03:05.118 --> 03:08.019
Well, we gotta get out there
and... comb that hair.

03:08.087 --> 03:10.078
It looks like a chicken
scratched in it.

03:32.345 --> 03:34.609
Somebody ought to put that thing
out of its misery.

03:34.681 --> 03:37.206
Anybody got a skillet?
Sam? Sam?

03:37.283 --> 03:40.150
<i>You'll never guess who's
in the waiting room.</i>

03:40.220 --> 03:44.418
Elvis Presley.
You're him, and he's you.

03:44.490 --> 03:47.459
I know I'm him,
and he's me.

03:47.527 --> 03:50.724
# Mmm-me-me, me-me #

03:50.797 --> 03:54.164
Just warming up a little bit.

03:54.234 --> 03:57.465
I'll tell you one thing I would like to know
though is what the heck I'm doin' here.

03:57.537 --> 04:02.270
Ziggy's working on it, but she's working with
diminished capacity because she's starstruck.

04:02.342 --> 04:05.834
<i>I told you you were crazy. Thank the Lord this
is only a rehearsal. Sue Anne, you're next.</i>

04:05.912 --> 04:07.812
<i>Ready?
Do you know who this is?</i>

04:07.880 --> 04:10.405
<i>This is Red West,
one of Elvis's best friends.</i>

04:10.483 --> 04:12.474
This is incredible, huh?

04:16.055 --> 04:18.819
<i>Oh, no.</i>

04:28.901 --> 04:32.428
- She's gonna barf all over the place.
- I think he's right.

04:35.341 --> 04:38.640
<i>Poor thing. Well, looks like
we're gonna have to move on here.</i>

04:38.711 --> 04:41.578
<i>For the time being anyway.</i>

04:41.648 --> 04:44.014
Jus-Jus-Just take it easy now.

04:44.083 --> 04:47.780
Just catch your breath, all right?
Just breathe, okay?

04:47.854 --> 04:51.551
Uh, Sam, watch out.
You're gonna be wearing her lunch.

04:51.624 --> 04:54.616
<i>He can't tap dance
without his drum.</i>

04:54.694 --> 04:58.152
Poor thing.
Yeah.

04:58.231 --> 05:00.199
<i>Music.!
So?</i>

05:00.266 --> 05:02.200
So?
So?

05:02.268 --> 05:05.669
So? I know Ziggy is working under
some kind of a diminished capacity,

05:05.738 --> 05:08.730
but she's gotta have some idea as
to what I'm doin' here, right? Yeah.

05:08.808 --> 05:10.969
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
You're singing in the...

05:11.044 --> 05:12.978
<i>Southern Salute to America.
No.</i>

05:13.046 --> 05:15.844
<i>It's a talent contest.
This here is a rehearsal.</i>

05:15.915 --> 05:20.545
No, no, no. Why am I here as Elvis Presley? Because
this is a very important time in Elvis's life.

05:20.620 --> 05:22.679
In only two days,
he gets discovered.

05:22.755 --> 05:26.191
He gets discovered just fine without
my help. You're not here to help Elvis.

05:26.259 --> 05:28.591
What? Eighty-one percent chance
you're here to help Sue Anne.

05:28.661 --> 05:30.652
Well-
But not now!

05:30.730 --> 05:32.664
Al, I gotta go find her.
I may never see her again.

05:32.732 --> 05:35.724
You'll see her again. She's a local.
She works at Taylor's Diner.

05:35.802 --> 05:38.202
If I'm supposed to help her,
why can't I start helping her now?

05:38.271 --> 05:43.675
<i>Because no matter what you do, you cannot,
not, not, not mess up for Elvis, Yeah?</i>

05:43.743 --> 05:46.041
Or change anything,
'cause you'll change history big-time.

05:46.112 --> 05:50.981
<i>- If I go check on Sue Anne,
how is that gonna effect Elvis's life big-time?</i>

05:51.050 --> 05:53.712
<i>Well, it is, because... you're on.
Is Elvis Presley here?</i>

05:53.786 --> 05:55.913
Huh? On?
On!

05:55.988 --> 05:57.922
I'm on?
On. You're on.

05:57.990 --> 06:00.458
<i>Come on, son.
Let's go. On? On.</i>

06:03.296 --> 06:06.925
# Oh, I wish I were
in the land of cotton #

06:06.999 --> 06:09.661
# Old times there are not forgotten #

06:09.736 --> 06:13.797
# Look away, look away, look away #

06:13.873 --> 06:15.864
<i>Sam-
# Dixieland #</i>

06:15.942 --> 06:18.877
<i>S- Sell it a little bit.
# I wish I were in Dixie #</i>

06:18.945 --> 06:22.540
#Away, away # I wish I
"was" in Dixie, not "were. "

06:22.615 --> 06:26.915
# In Dixieland
I'll take my stand to live #

06:26.986 --> 06:29.181
#And die in Dixie #
Sam, you're not trying.

06:29.255 --> 06:31.519
#Away, away #
Oh, boy.

06:31.591 --> 06:34.424
- Oh, boy.
- #Away down south in Dixie #

06:34.494 --> 06:38.658
#Away, away #

06:38.731 --> 06:43.600
#Away down sou-outh #

06:43.669 --> 06:47.605
Ow.
# In Dixie ##

06:47.673 --> 06:50.301
<i>- Sam, I know you
can do better than that!</i>

06:50.376 --> 06:52.844
Just have Ziggy get me
outta here fast, okay?

06:52.912 --> 06:54.937
<i>All righty, here now.
Who's next here?</i>

06:55.014 --> 06:57.574
Just remember,
you're a legend.

06:57.650 --> 07:00.642
<i>Uh, where's that square dancin'group,
the Hicks Hoppers?</i>

07:00.720 --> 07:04.019
<i>- Now, what happened to you
up there, Elvis?</i>

07:04.090 --> 07:06.650
L- I just was having
kind of an off day, you know?

07:06.726 --> 07:08.990
- Ain't that the truth.
- Yeah.

07:09.061 --> 07:11.052
<i>Two ham and eggs.</i>

07:15.768 --> 07:19.204
Miss, we're ready to
order over here. "Miss"?

07:19.272 --> 07:21.672
When did you start
callin' Sue Anne "miss"?

07:21.741 --> 07:23.936
I'm just kiddin' around, you know?

07:29.582 --> 07:33.177
- You say you're ready to order?
- Yes. Let's see. Uh-

07:33.252 --> 07:37.450
- I hope she can stand the sight of food.
- I heard that, Red.

07:37.523 --> 07:41.516
Aw, come on, Sue Anne.
Now, I was just kiddin'.

07:41.594 --> 07:44.893
Don't go takin' it to heart.
Wait. I'll handle it, okay?

07:47.667 --> 07:49.828
<i>That ham and eggs up?
I'm-I'm really sorry.</i>

07:49.902 --> 07:53.463
W- We don't mean
to hurt your feelings.

07:53.539 --> 07:55.973
You know, I-I came here
especially just to see you.

07:56.042 --> 08:00.172
Elvis, the two of you been comin' here
long as I can remember,

08:00.246 --> 08:02.544
and you never paid me
no never mind before.

08:02.615 --> 08:06.779
Well, that was before.
But now, it's different.

08:06.853 --> 08:09.048
I mean, we used to come here
for different reasons.

08:09.121 --> 08:13.114
<i>L- I- I-I'm sorry. My-</i>

08:13.192 --> 08:16.684
My head's a little shook up
from the rehearsal still.

08:16.762 --> 08:20.425
L- I-I was pretty scared.
Yeah. I know the feeling.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.435
But, you know, stage fright
can be a good thing.

08:23.503 --> 08:27.530
Because once your, you know, knees start
to knockin', it kinda gets you moving.

08:27.607 --> 08:30.371
Yeah, well, I don't- I don't
worry much about my knees.

08:30.443 --> 08:33.275
Oh, yeah. I guess I'll
never make it to the Opry.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.678
Why not? Why not?
You just saw why not.

08:35.748 --> 08:39.582
- Julie, honey, order's up.
- Yeah.

08:39.652 --> 08:42.381
- Julie!
- I heard you the first time!

08:43.489 --> 08:45.423
I'll see ya.
See ya.

08:45.491 --> 08:48.517
<i>That child's such a dreamer, she'd lose
her head if it wasn't screwed on tight.</i>

08:48.594 --> 08:51.791
You know, there-there's nothing
wrong with being a dreamer.

08:51.864 --> 08:56.096
It hurts too much when you wake up.
You'll never know unless you try.

08:56.168 --> 09:00.867
Now, what's it matter to you?
Uh, it just matters.

09:00.940 --> 09:03.932
You matter. Look,

09:04.010 --> 09:06.444
everybody should be a dreamer.

09:07.680 --> 09:10.774
You gotta reach for the stars,
not for the ceiling.

09:10.850 --> 09:14.411
But the ceiling keeps you
outta the rain. Excuse me.

09:16.889 --> 09:21.258
What kind of music do you like
the most? Uh, gospel, I guess.

09:21.327 --> 09:24.660
Give me this.
What are you doin'?

09:24.730 --> 09:26.664
Sing something.
What? Here?

09:26.732 --> 09:28.666
Right now.
I'll get fired.

09:28.734 --> 09:32.500
No, you won't get fired. Come on. Sing
something right now. Sing with me. I can't.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.370
Um-

10:49.915 --> 10:53.749
All right! All right!

10:53.819 --> 10:57.311
- All right!
- Yeah!

10:57.390 --> 11:00.223
You sing like an angel.
Aw, go on.

11:00.292 --> 11:03.227
No, you do. It's true.
You got a lot of talent.

11:03.295 --> 11:05.889
Well, then the good Lord must've
been smilin' down on me.

11:05.965 --> 11:10.493
You must've been reachin' for the stars, 'cause I
don't think he could see you through the ceiling.

11:10.569 --> 11:13.197
<i>Come on.! Let's do another
one.! Come on.! Let's go.!</i>

11:13.272 --> 11:15.502
Don't stop. Let's do
another one. Come on.

11:15.574 --> 11:17.508
Let's do another one. I
can't. I'm all sung out.

11:17.576 --> 11:19.806
Come on. You wanna do another
one? Let's do another one.

11:19.879 --> 11:21.870
You wanna hear 'em do another one?
Yeah!

11:21.947 --> 11:23.881
Here we go!
All righty. Oh!

11:23.949 --> 11:26.042
Ho!

11:26.118 --> 11:28.780
Sue Anne?

11:30.222 --> 11:32.213
What in God's earth is goin' on here?

11:32.291 --> 11:34.919
We're just havin' some fun.

11:34.994 --> 11:39.055
You're a lady, Sue Anne, and you will comport
yourself properly in public. Ooh, apple pie!

11:39.131 --> 11:41.759
Look, we were just singing a
song. Elvis's favorite. Mmm!

11:41.834 --> 11:43.768
Gospel, as a matter of fact.
I wish I could taste it.

11:43.836 --> 11:46.930
Well, our type of people save
gospel singin' for Sunday mornin'.

11:47.006 --> 11:49.304
- I sing it whenever I can.
- That so, boy?

11:51.944 --> 11:55.607
My name is Elvis Presley.

11:55.681 --> 11:57.615
<i>And you are-
I know who you are.</i>

11:57.683 --> 11:59.947
Everybody knows
you're bad news, boy.

12:00.019 --> 12:02.715
This nozzle
would be Frank Begley.

12:02.788 --> 12:04.779
I'm not sure I like being called a boy.

12:04.857 --> 12:08.122
And I don't like your type
hangin' around this establishment.

12:08.194 --> 12:10.287
That's a shame, 'cause, you know, I
- I was just gettin' ready...

12:10.362 --> 12:13.297
to sit down over here
and have some lunch.

12:13.365 --> 12:17.131
Would you care to join us? I
don't eat with barnyard animals.

12:17.203 --> 12:19.228
Let's go, Sue Anne.

12:19.305 --> 12:21.603
Well, what about the rest of my shift?

12:21.674 --> 12:26.008
- Your sister can cover your shift. Isn't that right, Julie?
- Yes.

12:26.078 --> 12:29.070
Now, you keep a distance
from my fiancée, ya hear?

12:30.249 --> 12:32.240
Enjoy your food.

12:41.727 --> 12:44.252
<i>He treats her like he owns her.</i>

12:44.330 --> 12:47.697
Well, leave it alone, Elvis.
There's a lot more fish in the sea.

12:47.767 --> 12:50.793
Frank Begley's a good catch.
Do tell.

12:50.870 --> 12:53.202
His family owns the biggest
shoe factory in Louisville.

12:53.272 --> 12:55.797
Well, then, there now.

12:55.875 --> 12:58.969
Can you beat that?
The biggest shoe factory in Louisville.

12:59.044 --> 13:01.205
Sam, Julie's right.
Sue Anne marries Frank.

13:01.280 --> 13:04.249
They live in Louisville
where he runs the family business.

13:04.316 --> 13:07.183
I guess she'll never go barefoot.
Say what?

13:07.253 --> 13:10.484
Uh, nothin'. Nothin'.
Look, uh, you go on.

13:10.556 --> 13:13.320
I'm gonna make a phone call, okay?
All right.

13:13.392 --> 13:16.122
See ya later, Red.
See ya.

13:20.866 --> 13:22.857
Did you hear her sing, Al?
No.

13:22.935 --> 13:24.869
How is she?
She's great.

13:24.937 --> 13:27.132
Yeah? It's gotta be
what she was meant to do.

13:27.206 --> 13:29.538
I don't know about that.
Ziggy says Sue Anne Winters...

13:29.608 --> 13:31.542
really didn't do anything
with her singing.

13:31.610 --> 13:33.976
She married Frank,
and he left her after two years.

13:34.046 --> 13:37.243
And he was kinda free and easy
with the back of his hand too.

13:37.316 --> 13:41.252
Well, we can't let that happen. Look, both
of us know you're here to help Sue Anne,

13:41.320 --> 13:43.811
but you can't mess up
anything for Elvis.

13:43.889 --> 13:46.050
All right. Look,
you just tell me what Elvis did,

13:46.125 --> 13:48.059
and I'll make sure that
I don't mess it up. Okay.

13:48.127 --> 13:51.961
In the morning, you gotta go into
the recording studio at Sun Records...

13:52.031 --> 13:54.898
and cut a record
for your mother's birthday,

13:54.967 --> 13:58.425
and at the same time
impress Marion Keisker.

13:58.504 --> 14:03.441
She works at Sun Records, and she will play the
record for Mr. Phillips, and the rest is history.

14:03.509 --> 14:06.672
You just gotta cut the record tomorrow
morning. All right. I'll be there.

14:06.745 --> 14:11.239
Now, what about Sue Anne? Uh, well, you're gonna
see her at the talent contest tomorrow night.

14:11.317 --> 14:14.684
She was going to drop out, but
you changed that. Okay. Good.

14:14.753 --> 14:17.847
Well, I gotta go.
I don't wanna be late here.

14:17.923 --> 14:22.656
Late for what? Elvis is gonna give a private
little concert for us in the waiting room.

14:22.728 --> 14:25.697
What? Standing room only.
I don't wanna be late.

14:25.764 --> 14:28.858
What about me?
What about you? Uh-

14:28.934 --> 14:30.925
Oh, you're late too.
You're late for dinner.

14:31.003 --> 14:32.937
What?
Yeah.

14:33.005 --> 14:35.439
Your mama's gonna be very unhappy.

14:35.507 --> 14:38.943
<i>Hi. How y'all doin'?</i>

14:44.516 --> 14:46.541
<i>Elvis Aaron Presley.</i>

14:46.619 --> 14:49.019
I'm fit to be tied,
that's what I am.

14:49.088 --> 14:51.886
You better have a darn good excuse
for bein' late, young man.

14:51.957 --> 14:55.893
I'm sorry, ma'am, but I don't.
Well,

14:55.961 --> 14:58.225
I guess an apology's
better than an excuse.

14:58.297 --> 15:01.357
Just see it don't happen again.
Yes, ma'am.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.731
You forgettin' somethin'?
Hmm?

15:06.805 --> 15:09.740
Oh, yeah.
I probably should wash my-

15:14.280 --> 15:16.510
Uh, for what we are
about to receive,

15:16.582 --> 15:19.073
may the good Lord
make us truly grateful.

15:19.151 --> 15:21.210
Amen.
Amen.

15:23.622 --> 15:26.921
How was your rehearsal?
Mmm.

15:26.992 --> 15:29.517
Pretty good.
But it's gonna get better.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.654
I'm going to get better.
Much better.

15:31.730 --> 15:35.894
In fact, I think it's what
I'm meant to do.

15:35.968 --> 15:39.335
Be a singer, I mean.
Is that what the good Lord told ya?

15:41.874 --> 15:44.536
Well, in a way, yeah.
As a matter of fact, he did.

15:45.878 --> 15:47.869
Well, since you and he
are on such good terms,

15:47.947 --> 15:51.713
maybe you could ask him to take care
of that stack of bills on the counter.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.621
I'll tell you what, Mama.

15:56.689 --> 15:59.157
Someday, I'm gonna take care
of all that for ya.

15:59.224 --> 16:01.192
What? You gonna rob a bank?

16:01.260 --> 16:04.320
No, ma'am.
I'm going to become a famous singer.

16:04.396 --> 16:08.059
Oh, like, uh, Perry Como?
No.

16:08.133 --> 16:11.967
Not like Perry Como.
Um, bigger than Perry Como,

16:12.037 --> 16:15.473
and even bigger than that,
uh- that Pat Boone guy.

16:15.541 --> 16:18.408
Bigger than Pat Boone
and Perry Como put together.

16:18.477 --> 16:20.502
You wait and see, Mama.

16:23.349 --> 16:25.317
<i>Just start whenever you're ready.</i>

16:25.384 --> 16:29.218
There's nothing to worry about.
Oh, I'm not worried.

16:29.288 --> 16:33.281
Don't worry about me. Elvis
sings like nobody you ever heard.

16:36.028 --> 16:39.191
<i>Are you ready?</i>

16:39.264 --> 16:41.698
<i>Uh, just-just a second.
I'm almost ready.</i>

16:41.767 --> 16:45.464
I just have a last couple things to tune
up here, and I'll be right with you, okay?

16:45.537 --> 16:47.505
Oh, good. I got here
just in time looks like.

16:47.573 --> 16:50.508
You sure did. I'm about to give Marion
Keisker the concert of a lifetime.

16:50.576 --> 16:52.942
<i>Great. What songs you gonna sing?
Sun Records.</i>

16:53.012 --> 16:56.504
Well, "Amazing Grace" worked
pretty good. No, no, no, no, no.

16:56.582 --> 16:59.881
You gotta sing exactly
the same tunes that Elvis sang.

16:59.952 --> 17:03.285
<i>What were they?
Uh, "My Happiness';...</i>

17:03.355 --> 17:06.085
<i>and "That's When
Your Heartaches Begin. "</i>

17:06.157 --> 17:08.558
<i>I never heard of those songs.
You're the one...</i>

17:08.627 --> 17:12.256
<i>that programmed Ziggy's data banks
with all of Elvis Presley's hits.</i>

17:12.330 --> 17:16.061
You know 'em backwards and forwards. You used to
sing 'em for days in a row. Drive me crazy with 'em.

17:16.135 --> 17:18.365
<i>Is he all right?
You okay?</i>

17:18.436 --> 17:21.133
Yeah, I'm fine.

17:21.205 --> 17:23.299
Um, well-

17:23.375 --> 17:27.334
Actually, I got a little bit of a-
Frog in my throat.

17:27.413 --> 17:30.348
Let me just get a little water.
I'll be right with ya, okay?

17:30.416 --> 17:33.908
<i>Sam, don't panic.
Those are great songs for him.</i>

17:33.986 --> 17:36.750
<i>That's all wonderful, except
I'm not Elvis, and he's not here.</i>

17:36.822 --> 17:39.382
<i>Okay, I'll sing the songs,
and you repeat after me.</i>

17:39.458 --> 17:42.450
<i>What? I'm afraid we need
to start, Mr. Presley.</i>

17:42.528 --> 17:45.929
Come on. Come on,
come on, come on. Okay.

17:47.366 --> 17:50.062
Okay. Okay.
Key. What key?

17:50.135 --> 17:52.535
"C." "C."

17:57.643 --> 18:00.168
Here we go.

18:09.888 --> 18:12.152
Why'd you stop?

18:12.224 --> 18:14.852
Sam. Sam.
That's "Jingle Bells. "

18:14.927 --> 18:16.861
Huh? Come on, Sam.
That's "Jingle Bells. "

18:16.929 --> 18:19.762
Take it from the top. Come on.
No, no, no!

18:19.832 --> 18:22.096
Would you like to reschedule
your appointment?

18:22.167 --> 18:24.397
No!

18:25.537 --> 18:28.165
I'm gonna sing another song.
No, Sam.

18:28.240 --> 18:30.538
You've been practicing
this one for weeks. I know.

18:30.609 --> 18:33.203
I'm tired of it. That's because
I've been practicing so much. Sam-

18:33.278 --> 18:36.008
<i>So I'm just gonna go with "Jingle
Bells. " Sam, Elvis recorded...</i>

18:36.081 --> 18:38.072
a whole album of
Christmas music! No! No!

18:38.150 --> 18:41.085
I don't care what he-
Oh, geez.

18:41.153 --> 18:43.417
"Blue Christmas. "
"Blue Chri"-

18:43.489 --> 18:46.083
Okay. "Blue"- Wait, wait.
I thought it was white.

18:46.158 --> 18:49.150
Yeah, well, Elvis had a big hit
with blue! Okay, I'm ready now.

18:49.228 --> 18:53.494
<i>- Thank God.
- Seventy-five, one dollar.</i>

18:53.565 --> 18:55.658
You can pick up your
record tomorrow. Thank you.

18:55.734 --> 18:58.567
Wait. She's gotta play it for
Phillips. Tell her. Listen,

18:58.637 --> 19:01.697
is there any chance Mr. Phillips
might like to hear this?

19:01.773 --> 19:05.709
You're crazy. It's hard to be in the
mood for Christmas carols in July.

19:05.777 --> 19:08.211
Well, I know that but, uh-
You can't leave,

19:08.280 --> 19:11.215
'cause Ziggy's projecting that Elvis
never meets him. Let me ask you this.

19:11.283 --> 19:13.877
You think he might be
at the talent show tonight?

19:13.952 --> 19:16.716
Oh, Mr. Phillips is far too busy
for talent shows.

19:16.788 --> 19:19.154
- Well-
- Tell her it's a regional show.

19:19.224 --> 19:22.853
- Really big!
- It's a big, regional talent show,

19:22.928 --> 19:26.921
and there are gonna be a lot of fine performers
there that he might want to take a look at.

19:26.999 --> 19:31.834
<i>Plus the fact that I understand that there are
going to be some talent scouts from Nashville there.</i>

19:31.904 --> 19:34.372
You're full of it.
The odds are going up now.

19:34.439 --> 19:36.669
Marion's thinking about
going. Good. Actually,

19:36.742 --> 19:40.041
I usually screen the new acts
around here.

19:40.112 --> 19:42.046
I have a real eye for talent.

19:42.114 --> 19:46.483
- Is that so?
- Touch down. I'm gonna run this by Ziggy, but I think we're back in the game.

19:46.552 --> 19:49.180
Uh, well, uh, does that mean
that I'll see you tonight?

19:49.254 --> 19:53.088
- Are you going to sing?
- It's what I do best, ma'am.

20:10.609 --> 20:13.169
Oh, Sam. Good news.

20:13.245 --> 20:16.942
Ziggy says 90% chance that if you go on
tonight, you're gonna win Marion over.

20:17.015 --> 20:19.176
<i>Good. Now, come on.
Let's give a big hand...</i>

20:19.251 --> 20:22.778
<i>To little Billy C.,
all the way from Hope, Arkansas.</i>

20:22.854 --> 20:25.152
<i>Nicejob.</i>

20:25.224 --> 20:27.852
Good job, kid. Yeah.

20:29.261 --> 20:31.456
<i>Al, I'm after the pig caller,
okay? Now let's give...</i>

20:31.530 --> 20:34.192
<i>It shouldn't be much competition.
A fine welcome to a songbird...</i>

20:34.266 --> 20:38.327
<i>Yeah. It depends on how good he is. From
our own hometown, Miss Sue Anne Winters.!</i>

20:38.403 --> 20:40.564
Oh, no.
What?

20:47.579 --> 20:51.174
Oh, no.
Oh, she's gonna blow chunks again.

20:51.250 --> 20:55.084
Somebody get a mop.
I can't stand it.

20:55.153 --> 20:58.919
<i>No! Sam! Sam!
You're not on yet, Sam!</i>

21:00.259 --> 21:04.457
- Uh-
- Oh, no.

22:45.197 --> 22:49.827
<i>Miss Sue Anne Winters
and Mr. Elvis Presley.!</i>

22:49.901 --> 22:53.803
<i>Take a bow, you two. Come on.
Ain't that somethin'else?</i>

22:53.872 --> 22:59.208
<i>- Boy, those are two special people
right there. What a performance.</i>

23:03.048 --> 23:05.744
Do you hear that? They
loved us! Yes, they did.

23:05.817 --> 23:08.377
You were great! You were
- Congratulations.

23:08.453 --> 23:11.547
Thank you. I want to see you
at Sun Records tomorrow at noon.

23:11.623 --> 23:16.026
And don't be late. Mr. Phillips leaves for
Nashville in the afternoon. Okay. All right.

23:16.094 --> 23:19.586
I'm so happy for you.
Honey, you're half the act.

23:19.664 --> 23:21.791
Now, y'all be on time, you hear?

23:21.867 --> 23:23.801
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.

23:23.869 --> 23:26.804
Half the a
- Oh, my gosh. This is the happiest day of my life!

23:26.872 --> 23:28.999
Not mine.
It's all because of you.

23:29.074 --> 23:31.304
No. No, it wasn't just me.
You were out there too, right?

23:31.376 --> 23:33.401
I couldn't have done it without you.
Oh, come on.

23:33.478 --> 23:36.914
<i>Sam, you're not supposed
to be a duo, Sam!</i>

23:36.982 --> 23:41.851
<i>- Sam, you're turning the king of rock and
roll into Donny and Marie.! - Oh, Elvis, I-</i>

23:46.324 --> 23:48.258
I love you, Elvis.

23:58.770 --> 24:04.731
<i>According to Ziggy, the odds of the two of you
getting a recording contract are a lousy 19-to-1.</i>

24:04.810 --> 24:08.644
Al, news flash. Ziggy has
been wrong before. Mmm.

24:08.713 --> 24:13.980
Right? Yeah, but in 1954, the world
was just not ready for Sonny and Cher.

24:14.052 --> 24:17.351
As a matter of fact, the world
was never ready for Sonny and Cher.

24:17.422 --> 24:21.358
Al, Sue Anne is special. I mean,
there's something unique about her.

24:21.426 --> 24:24.520
<i>I mean, she's innocent and-and-and
vulnerable, and- Yeah, I know.</i>

24:24.596 --> 24:27.929
Elvis has a soft spot for her, too,
but the Hollywood publicists...

24:27.999 --> 24:31.400
did not want him
to have a girl back home, so-

24:31.470 --> 24:35.634
So he forgot about her. I don't know if he
forgot about her, but he never went back for her.

24:35.707 --> 24:39.108
So don't think what you're thinking.
How do you know what I'm thinkin'?

24:39.177 --> 24:42.442
Because I know you. In three
years, he's gonna meet Priscilla.

24:42.514 --> 24:45.711
They're gonna get married and have a baby.
You don't want to jeopardize that.

24:45.784 --> 24:48.344
You don't want to jeopardize any of it.
I don't know.

24:48.420 --> 24:52.447
I mean, what about what happened
to Elvis later on, right?

24:52.524 --> 24:57.894
<i>I mean, maybe ifhe'd been with Sue Anne, then
things would've ended differently than they did.</i>

24:57.963 --> 24:59.931
<i>Presley.!</i>

24:59.998 --> 25:02.831
- Aw, great.
- I need to have a few words with you, boy.

25:02.901 --> 25:08.066
How about, "Have a nice day"? Look,
let's just call it a truce, okay?

25:08.139 --> 25:11.700
I don't soil my hands with trash.

25:12.844 --> 25:16.780
<i>Yeah, well, Frank,
what do you want?</i>

25:16.848 --> 25:21.012
- I think he-he wants to punch you out.
- You've compromised a lady's honor.

25:21.086 --> 25:23.384
I don't take kindly to that,
especially when the lady's mine.

25:23.455 --> 25:26.083
Yeah, but she's not yours.
She doesn't belong to you.

25:26.157 --> 25:29.684
That a fact? That's a fact. Did you
see her up there on that stage tonight?

25:29.761 --> 25:32.457
She's got talent.
She has a delicate condition.

25:32.531 --> 25:36.058
Well, her condition
seems just fine to me.

25:46.144 --> 25:48.704
Good, Sam.

25:48.780 --> 25:51.305
Break it up! Break it up!
Break it up!

25:51.383 --> 25:53.408
Stay out of this, Red!
Break it up now!

25:56.121 --> 25:59.488
- Good, Sam.
- Break it up!

26:02.027 --> 26:04.325
Left! Use the left!

26:07.699 --> 26:11.567
- Hey, that's dirty!
- Okay. You wanna fight dirty?

26:11.636 --> 26:15.436
<i>I know how to fight dirty.
You want a lesson in fightin'dirty?</i>

26:15.507 --> 26:17.998
How about it, Elvis?

26:18.076 --> 26:20.772
Let him go. Stop it!

26:21.846 --> 26:24.508
- Let him go.
- Get up. Go!

26:27.452 --> 26:30.250
Shame on the both of you!
Are you all right, Frank?

26:30.322 --> 26:33.086
"Are you all right, Frank?"
What about the Pelvis?

26:33.158 --> 26:36.787
- How could the two of you gang up on him like that?
- We didn't gang up on him.

26:36.861 --> 26:41.594
He started the whole fight. Red here was
comin' to help me out. He started kickin' me.

26:41.666 --> 26:44.692
- Don't lie. I know what I saw. Lyin' ain't gonna do you any good.
- He ain't lyin'.

26:44.769 --> 26:47.329
- Hush up!
- Look, we didn't gang up on him.

26:47.405 --> 26:50.465
<i>I said hush.! I don't know.
Maybe frank's right.</i>

26:50.542 --> 26:55.036
I didn't want to believe the things I heard
about you, but maybe they really are true.

26:56.481 --> 26:58.449
Come on. You think
you can walk? I'll try.

27:00.452 --> 27:03.387
Easy. Easy.

27:04.456 --> 27:07.550
Ooh, I'd like to give
him one more pop! Come on.

27:07.626 --> 27:09.560
<i>You stay away from that man,
ya hear?</i>

27:09.628 --> 27:13.997
You're always gettin' into scrapes these
days. I don't know what to do with you.

27:14.065 --> 27:19.469
<i>Look, I didn't start the fight. It don't matter
who started it. It takes two to finish it.</i>

27:19.537 --> 27:21.801
What's so special
about this girl anyhow?

27:21.873 --> 27:25.866
How'd you know it was about a girl?
- 'Cause I'm your mama.

27:25.944 --> 27:29.880
<i>You gotta stop this fightin', honey.
Last fight cost you yourjob.</i>

27:29.948 --> 27:33.076
You get fired from Crown Electric-
I'll find something better to do.

27:33.151 --> 27:37.588
Doin' what? Sweepin' sunshine off
the sidewalk? Mama- Mama- Mama-

27:37.656 --> 27:39.590
Now, don't worry, okay?
Oh, Elvis.

27:39.658 --> 27:41.751
Everything's gonna work out.
How do you know?

27:41.826 --> 27:44.989
I just know. Like I know about
- about other things.

27:45.063 --> 27:47.554
<i>Like what?
Well, like-</i>

27:47.632 --> 27:49.566
like I know about my singing.

27:49.634 --> 27:53.502
Elvis, honey, I keep tellin' you,
you have to be realistic.

27:53.571 --> 27:56.369
You want realistic? All right.
I'll give you realistic.

27:57.909 --> 28:01.276
You are gonna live in the biggest house
you can ever imagine.

28:02.380 --> 28:05.907
You are gonna have the most
beautiful clothes and drive a new car.

28:05.984 --> 28:09.750
And you are gonna be the mother
of the most famous singer who ever lived.

28:09.821 --> 28:15.282
I don't know whether to kiss you or slap
some sense into you. I'll go for the kiss.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.590
Oh, honey. Mmm! Ow!

28:17.662 --> 28:19.596
Oh, I'm sorry.
That's okay.

28:19.664 --> 28:22.224
<i>1954 was an age of innocence,</i>

28:22.300 --> 28:25.861
<i>a time when people still believed
in the American Dream.</i>

28:25.937 --> 28:29.532
<i>I realized that I had leaped
into a man who personified that dream,</i>

28:29.607 --> 28:33.703
<i>a man who went from being a truck driver
to a superstar overnight.</i>

28:33.778 --> 28:36.440
<i>Walking a mile
in Elvis Presley's blue suede shoes...</i>

28:36.514 --> 28:38.846
<i>before he became
the idol of millions...</i>

28:38.917 --> 28:41.545
<i>made me realize he was
Just a normal person.</i>

28:41.619 --> 28:45.111
<i>I kept wondering ifhe would have been
happier had he stayed that way.</i>

28:46.124 --> 28:51.653
<i>Maybe I couldn't change things for Elvis,
but at least I had a chance to help Sue Anne.</i>

28:51.730 --> 28:54.324
<i>Hi, Julie.
Will you tell your sister I'm here?</i>

28:54.399 --> 28:56.424
Sue Anne didn't come in
this morning.

28:56.501 --> 28:59.129
What? Wait. Wait.

28:59.204 --> 29:01.138
Whoa. Wait a second.
Is something wrong?

29:01.206 --> 29:03.140
<i>Is it stage fright?</i>

29:03.208 --> 29:05.836
No, Sam. It's not stage
fright. Not this time.

29:05.910 --> 29:08.743
Where is she?
I can't tell.

29:08.813 --> 29:10.906
She's home, Sam.

29:10.982 --> 29:13.314
How can she be home?
We got an audition in half an hour.

29:13.384 --> 29:16.046
Frank is picking her up at 2:00,
and they're leaving for Louisville.

29:16.121 --> 29:18.988
They're gonna stop by the courthouse
and pick up a marriage license.

29:19.057 --> 29:21.423
All right. Okay.
Where does she live?

29:21.493 --> 29:24.428
She lives, a-
at 42 Elm Street.

29:24.496 --> 29:27.226
That's 12 blocks north of here.
Okay.

29:27.298 --> 29:30.927
No. Sam, no! You gotta let her go.
What do you mean, I gotta let her go?

29:31.002 --> 29:34.403
Ziggy said that I'm supposed to be here
to stop her from throwing away her life.

29:34.472 --> 29:38.772
That doesn't mean you can mess everything up for
Elvis. You've got an audition in half an hour!

29:38.843 --> 29:42.540
What about Sue Anne? You can't get from here
to her place and back in time for the audition.

29:42.614 --> 29:46.516
I have to. Look, Phillips is
leaving for Nashville this afternoon.

29:46.584 --> 29:51.317
You can't mess up this
audition, Sam! I won't.

29:51.389 --> 29:53.789
- Sam, Ziggy says-
- Forget Ziggy.

30:09.040 --> 30:11.668
You don't have to look at me,
you don't have to talk to me,

30:11.743 --> 30:14.143
but you have to,
in a half an hour, sing with me.

30:14.212 --> 30:18.046
The heck I do.
Look, it's your dream.

30:18.116 --> 30:22.177
You waited your whole life for this. L
- I told you, I don't believe in no dreamin'.

30:22.253 --> 30:25.814
Yeah, well, I do. And I got
enough dreams for the both of us.

30:25.890 --> 30:29.917
I'm 19 years old.
It's time for me to settle down.

30:29.994 --> 30:33.088
What are you talkin' about?
It's time for you to shake things up.

30:33.164 --> 30:36.099
Take a chance for a change.

30:36.167 --> 30:40.536
If I get mixed up with the likes of you, then it
could cost me marryin' a decent man like Frank.

30:40.605 --> 30:42.835
You think about this.
Think about 20 years from now.

30:42.907 --> 30:46.741
You wake up one morning, all of a sudden
you're wondering what might have happened today.

30:46.811 --> 30:49.541
<i>Sue Anne, you get in this house.!</i>

30:49.614 --> 30:51.775
Comin', Mama.
What have you got to lose?

30:51.850 --> 30:53.943
You come with me,
you audition for Mr. Phillips,

30:54.018 --> 30:56.077
he doesn't sign you,
you come back, you marry Frank.

30:56.154 --> 31:00.090
But what if he likes us? Wouldn't
that be a wonderful choice to have?

31:05.997 --> 31:07.988
I'll go get my music.
All right.

31:16.074 --> 31:19.441
Come on.
Here we go.

31:22.614 --> 31:24.878
Mr. Phillips?
Miss Keisker?

31:24.949 --> 31:27.782
Hello?
It's Elvis Presley.

31:30.021 --> 31:32.489
Oh, no.
They gotta be in there.

31:32.557 --> 31:34.957
It wasn't meant to be, Elvis.
It was.

31:35.026 --> 31:39.326
No. If the good Lord wanted me to be a
singer, then Mr. Phillips would still be here.

31:39.397 --> 31:43.595
Maybe the good Lord's testing you. You
know, it isn't easy reaching for those stars.

31:43.668 --> 31:46.660
Look, I have no business
tryin' in the first place.

31:46.738 --> 31:48.763
No, Sue Anne,
wait a second now.

31:48.840 --> 31:50.831
Will you listen to me?
I listened to you plenty.

31:50.909 --> 31:53.503
I listened to all
your crazy dreamin',

31:54.913 --> 31:56.972
and I gave it a chance.

31:57.048 --> 32:00.848
And now I'll never wonder what I missed,
cause I didn't miss nothin'.

32:02.654 --> 32:05.145
I gotta go.

32:05.223 --> 32:07.817
Sue Anne-

32:07.892 --> 32:09.951
Good-bye, Elvis.

32:33.217 --> 32:38.177
I don't know whether to feel sorry
for you or say, "I told you so. "

32:38.256 --> 32:40.781
She left.
I know.

32:40.858 --> 32:44.385
Al, I know I was here
to help Sue Anne.

32:44.462 --> 32:46.657
<i>Ziggy even agreed with me.
You did help.</i>

32:46.731 --> 32:50.394
Then why haven't I leaped? Ziggy says it's
because you've gotta make things right for Elvis.

32:50.468 --> 32:52.493
How can I make things right
with Elvis? Right?

32:52.570 --> 32:56.802
I mean, Mr. Phillips has gotta be on a plane to Nash
- to Nashville right now.

32:56.874 --> 32:58.808
Uh, he left the studio
20 minutes ago.

32:58.876 --> 33:02.573
I was on the way to the waiting room. I was
gonna break the news to the kid. I chickened out.

33:02.647 --> 33:05.741
Maybe I can still meet him at the
airport. He's not at the airport.

33:05.817 --> 33:07.808
Where is he then? I don't
know. This damn thing is-

33:07.885 --> 33:10.581
Come on, Ziggy! Hold
on now. Just hold on.

33:10.655 --> 33:13.146
Maybe he's still here. Maybe he
didn't hear me, and there's time.

33:13.224 --> 33:15.158
<i>Mr. Phillips?</i>

33:15.226 --> 33:17.217
Mr Phillips, it's me,
Elvis Presley! Sam-

33:17.295 --> 33:19.354
I'm here for my audition!
Mr. Phillips! Sam!

33:19.430 --> 33:22.058
Save your voice, will you?

33:22.133 --> 33:24.067
Here.
Something's coming up.

33:24.135 --> 33:29.402
Okay. He's, um-
He's at a dinner.

33:29.474 --> 33:31.669
He's at a dinner?
Yeah.

33:31.743 --> 33:35.338
In the middle of the afternoon, he's at
a dinner? He's at a dinner having diner.

33:35.413 --> 33:37.506
What?

33:37.582 --> 33:41.712
Oh, he's at the diner having
dinner. Make it lunch. Al-

33:41.786 --> 33:46.723
Oh, and get this! Get this! He's meeting
with the deejay that made Elvis a star,

33:46.791 --> 33:48.725
and the guy that first put him
on the radio.

33:48.793 --> 33:51.353
Isn't that great? Wow! You tell
Ziggy I have to know exactly...

33:51.429 --> 33:53.624
what songs Elvis sang
for Mr. Phillips.

33:53.698 --> 33:56.030
Okay. Okay. Um-

33:56.100 --> 34:00.036
"Blue Moon of Kentucky" and
"That's All Right, Mama. " Okay.

34:00.104 --> 34:05.064
Please, please tell me
you know these songs, Sam.

34:05.143 --> 34:07.077
Better than "Jingle Bells. "
Better-

34:10.281 --> 34:13.114
Better than "Jingle Bells. "

34:13.184 --> 34:15.880
<i>Excuse me, Mr. Phillips?
I'm Elvis Presley.</i>

34:15.953 --> 34:18.148
Well, that and a nickel'll
get you a phone call.

34:18.222 --> 34:21.020
Keep talking, Sam.

34:21.092 --> 34:25.722
Uh, I was-Well, I had an appointment
to audition for you this afternoon.

34:25.797 --> 34:28.994
Couldn't be. I'm leaving for Nashville
just as soon as I finish my lunch.

34:29.067 --> 34:32.900
No, not for later this afternoon.
Uh, it was at noon, but I was late.

34:32.969 --> 34:36.632
Oh, yeah. I had a 12:00 no-show.
A team. Brother and sister act.

34:36.706 --> 34:39.574
<i>Something like that.
Yeah, that's me. I mean, I-I'm them.</i>

34:39.643 --> 34:42.408
Um, you were supposed
to see me. No-

34:42.480 --> 34:45.005
Yeah, well, look, son,
I would like to help you out,

34:45.083 --> 34:47.643
but I'm right in the middle
of a business meeting here.

34:47.717 --> 34:51.552
- Five minutes, Sam. Five minutes- Say-
- Couldn't you just give me five minutes?

34:51.621 --> 34:56.286
- I promise you, you won't regret it.
- Do you know how many times I hear that in one day?

34:56.360 --> 35:00.763
<i>- I'm sorry, son.
- But he's the best.</i>

35:02.600 --> 35:07.765
- I don't believe this pretty young thing knows how to lie. Do you, sweetheart?
- No, sir.

35:07.839 --> 35:11.605
You and the guys go ahead.
I got some phone calls to make.

35:13.578 --> 35:16.342
All right, son.
You got yourself five minutes.

35:16.414 --> 35:20.407
- Thank you, Mr. Phillips.
- Ah, boys. Let's go make some music.

35:20.485 --> 35:22.419
Uh-huh!

35:25.156 --> 35:28.557
So, what are you going
to sing for us, Elvin?

35:28.626 --> 35:31.186
Uh, it-it's Elvis, sir.

35:31.262 --> 35:35.722
And I'm gonna sing, uh, "Blue Moon of
Kentucky" and "That's All Right, Mama. "

35:35.800 --> 35:39.327
This is an audition, son, not a concert.
You pick one or the other.

35:39.403 --> 35:42.964
Yeah. But you-you said
that I had five minutes, right?

35:43.040 --> 35:45.873
- Pick one or the other.
- Oh-

35:45.943 --> 35:48.776
<i>Uh- Uh-</i>

35:48.846 --> 35:51.940
#This is not supposed to happen
I'm supposed to get to sing those songs #

35:52.016 --> 35:55.281
You changed the circumstances of
the audition. Anything can happen.

35:55.353 --> 35:59.517
Yeah, well, uh
- #Tell me which song impressed Mr. Phillips the most #

35:59.590 --> 36:01.581
<i>We don't know. #Song impressed
Mr. Phillips the most #</i>

36:01.659 --> 36:06.255
- You all right in there, buddy?
- Yeah. I'm just having a little trouble pickin' a song.

36:06.330 --> 36:09.766
"That's All Right Mama" or "Blue Moon
of Kentucky. " Here's the best odds.

36:09.834 --> 36:13.361
<i>"That's All Right," "Blue Moon. " Elvis
started, and he did the "Moon"thing.</i>

36:13.437 --> 36:17.806
And that got Phillips's attention, and that
made Phillips want to have him play more,

36:17.875 --> 36:20.537
That made Elvis choose another tune,
then he did the "Mama" thing.

36:20.611 --> 36:22.545
<i>We're ready. Okay,
guys. "Blue Moon. "</i>

38:01.212 --> 38:04.545
Great.

38:06.884 --> 38:09.182
Great, Sam.
Thanks, guys.

38:09.253 --> 38:11.380
That was great.
It was really great.

38:11.455 --> 38:13.389
- You've got a lot of talent.
- Thank you, sir.

38:13.457 --> 38:15.357
Mm-hmm.
I would like to hear some more.

38:15.426 --> 38:17.360
Yes! "That's All Right,
Mama. " Here we go.

38:17.428 --> 38:21.228
<i>Not now. You make an appointment, and we'll
set up a session when I get back from Nashville.</i>

38:21.299 --> 38:26.566
- But I'm ready right now.
- I'm not. Come on now. I got a meetin' to finish, son.

38:26.637 --> 38:29.470
No. Wait a second. If you could
just wait a minute and listen to me-

38:29.540 --> 38:34.307
<i>- I already don't like it.
- You pushed him too hard, Sam.</i>

38:36.981 --> 38:40.007
You take care now, son.
I'll see you next week. Okay.

38:40.084 --> 38:43.019
<i>Thank you. But, no, no, no. He
doesn't. He cancels out on Elvis.</i>

38:43.087 --> 38:45.419
Aw, this is awful, Sam!
What?

38:45.489 --> 38:48.754
Well, Ziggy says now Elvis
doesn't even get discovered.

38:48.826 --> 38:51.818
And "Heartbreak Hotel" is
recorded by the Monkees. What?

38:51.896 --> 38:55.889
And "Jailhouse Rock" is recorded
by Tony Orlando and Dawn.

38:55.966 --> 38:58.025
Gag me with a spoon.
Oh, no!

38:58.102 --> 39:03.130
All right, Al. Tell me what one of Elvis'
hits are after "That's All Right, Mama. "

39:03.207 --> 39:07.837
Uh, uh, he recorded, "Baby,
Let's Play House" in September,

39:07.912 --> 39:11.348
and you programmed it into Ziggy's
memory, so you remember it, don't you?

39:11.415 --> 39:13.349
I remember.
Good.

39:13.417 --> 39:15.942
Oh! Tony Orlando and-

39:18.689 --> 39:21.522
Oh, uh, Sam, they're still
sittin' in the booth.

39:21.592 --> 39:25.119
Um, now, listen,
don't hold anything back now.

39:25.196 --> 39:27.130
Just really belt it out!

40:02.967 --> 40:05.128
<i>Oh, my Lord.!</i>

40:16.147 --> 40:18.741
A white man with a black voice.

40:25.189 --> 40:29.148
That's it, Sam!
Rock it out!

40:48.446 --> 40:50.437
<i>Hey.!</i>

40:51.849 --> 40:53.874
<i>Yeah.!</i>

41:36.093 --> 41:38.254
All right!

41:38.329 --> 41:43.460
<i>- Where on God's earth did you learn
a song like that?</i>

41:43.534 --> 41:45.832
Well, I just kind of, uh,
made it up.

41:45.903 --> 41:50.237
Well, I don't know what you just did,
son, but you keep on doing it.

41:50.307 --> 41:53.435
You mean-You mean, you're gonna sign
me? Does a chicken have feathers?

41:53.511 --> 41:55.809
Consider yourself signed,
sealed and delivered. Sam-

41:55.880 --> 41:58.280
Sam, this is great. You got
Elvis started. Thank you.

41:58.349 --> 42:02.342
You even inspired one of his first hit tunes over there, so, uh
- Thank you.

42:02.419 --> 42:05.115
So how come you haven't leaped?

42:07.291 --> 42:10.089
Well, that's the last of it.

42:10.160 --> 42:12.890
You go and you tell your mama
we're ready to leave.

42:12.963 --> 42:15.397
<i>Sue Anne.! Sue Anne.!</i>

42:16.834 --> 42:18.961
I got you your own audition,
all by yourself.

42:19.036 --> 42:21.903
I thought the audition was at noon.
Well, mine was. And guess what.

42:21.972 --> 42:27.308
<i>Mr. Phillips signed me. I got a contract.
See? And I got you your own audition.</i>

42:27.378 --> 42:29.972
And look. I did it.
Oh!

42:30.047 --> 42:33.141
You can too.
She'll do no such thing.

42:33.217 --> 42:35.242
Oh, what harm could it to, Frank?

42:35.319 --> 42:37.253
A lady don't work for a living.

42:37.321 --> 42:39.881
And she most surely
don't sing for a livin'.

42:39.957 --> 42:42.755
But it's what I wanna do.

42:42.826 --> 42:44.817
Sue Anne-

42:49.533 --> 42:52.127
I just don't cotton to the idea
of my wife bein' a circus act.

42:52.202 --> 42:54.898
Oh, Frank, it's not like that.

42:54.972 --> 42:56.906
Is-Is Doris Day a circus act?

42:56.974 --> 43:00.102
Is-Is-Is Debbie Reynolds a circus act?

43:00.177 --> 43:02.805
Oh, Frankie, there's nothing wrong
with singin'.

43:02.880 --> 43:04.814
Don't you see?

43:04.882 --> 43:07.373
What I see...

43:07.451 --> 43:11.182
is a fine young lady who wants somethin'
from life that I can't give her.

43:13.657 --> 43:15.921
<i>Maybe some man can, but I can't.</i>

43:15.993 --> 43:18.689
You can, if you want to.

43:18.762 --> 43:21.196
<i>It's got to be the way
it's got to be.</i>

43:21.265 --> 43:25.031
Now, either you get in this car, you come
away with me now, or you don't come at all.

43:40.117 --> 43:42.517
Well, I guess that's all
the answer I need.

43:53.964 --> 43:56.455
I owe you an apology.

43:56.533 --> 43:58.831
Accepted.

44:11.782 --> 44:16.879
<i>Mmm, Sam, listen to this.
Sue Anne here signs a recording contract.</i>

44:16.954 --> 44:20.754
She doesn't have a big career,
but she gets to perform on the Opry.

44:20.824 --> 44:24.624
<i>And she starts one of Elvis Presley's
first fan clubs.</i>

44:24.695 --> 44:27.994
I'm so scared.

44:28.065 --> 44:30.499
There's nothing to be afraid of.

44:30.567 --> 44:33.263
But what am I gonna do now?

44:33.337 --> 44:36.170
Well, you're gonna
reach for the stars.

44:36.240 --> 44:40.609
And you're gonna keep
right on reaching until you touch 'em.

45:10.507 --> 45:12.441
What do you got on tap?

45:12.509 --> 45:15.603
Schlitz.
Schlitz?

45:17.114 --> 45:20.345
Got Iron City, Duquesne and
Fort Pitt in bottles. Oh.

45:20.417 --> 45:25.320
- Yeah. Sch-Schlitz'll be fine.
- Regular... or schooner?

45:25.389 --> 45:28.449
<i>Schooner.</i>

45:34.898 --> 45:37.366
What do I owe you?
Fifteen cents.

45:37.434 --> 45:39.664
Fifteen cents.

45:39.737 --> 45:41.671
There you go.

46:06.663 --> 46:08.597
Oh, boy.
