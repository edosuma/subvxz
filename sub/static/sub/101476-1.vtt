WEBVTT

00:23.958 --> 00:25.250
[lively music plays]

00:27.083 --> 00:28.333
[bicycle rattling]

00:38.208 --> 00:39.125
[effort grunt]

00:41.333 --> 00:42.500
Now, where to begin?

00:45.500 --> 00:46.916
[baby crying]

00:47.541 --> 00:50.625
The first thing you need to know
is that my mother named me Enola.

00:50.708 --> 00:52.125
She insisted on it, in fact!

00:52.791 --> 00:54.250
[Eudoria whispering] Enola...

00:54.875 --> 00:56.416
-[normal voice] Enola.
-[Enola coos]

00:57.458 --> 00:58.875
[Enola] I know it's an unusual name,

00:58.958 --> 01:00.916
but my mother is rather a fan
of word games.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.791
-[Eudoria] On your marks.
-[Enola] Get set.

01:02.875 --> 01:03.708
[Eudoria] Go!

01:04.666 --> 01:07.083
[Enola] And Enola spelled backwards
reads, well,

01:07.791 --> 01:08.791
"alone."

01:10.333 --> 01:11.291
Yes!

01:11.375 --> 01:12.958
[Enola] She would continually tell me...

01:13.041 --> 01:14.666
You'll do very well on your own, Enola.

01:14.750 --> 01:16.083
-[Enola coos]
-[Eudoria] Mm-hmm.

01:16.166 --> 01:18.416
[Enola] And yet we were always together.

01:19.458 --> 01:21.041
-No. No.
-[laughing] Yes!

01:21.750 --> 01:23.583
[Enola] My father died when I was young.

01:24.541 --> 01:26.208
I don't really remember him.

01:27.333 --> 01:30.250
And both my brothers left home soon after.

01:30.333 --> 01:31.916
I barely remember them, either.

01:32.625 --> 01:34.625
So then it was just the two of us,

01:34.708 --> 01:35.833
and it was wonderful.

01:36.166 --> 01:37.083
[glass shatters]

01:38.041 --> 01:39.791
She was not an ordinary mother.

01:39.875 --> 01:43.125
She didn't teach me to string seashells
or practice my embroidery.

01:44.250 --> 01:45.708
We did different things.

01:47.708 --> 01:48.791
Reading,

01:51.083 --> 01:52.208
science,

01:53.041 --> 01:54.125
sports,

01:55.458 --> 01:57.000
all sorts of exercise,

01:57.666 --> 01:59.500
-both physical...
-[grunts]

01:59.583 --> 02:00.583
...and mental.

02:03.375 --> 02:06.333
Mother said we were free to do anything
at Ferndell...

02:10.166 --> 02:12.250
Oh. Sorry, Grandpa.

02:12.333 --> 02:13.166
[sighs]

02:13.250 --> 02:15.083
[Enola] ...and be anyone.

02:23.208 --> 02:24.625
She was my whole world.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.500
[both laugh]

02:28.291 --> 02:30.125
But she didn't share everything with me.

02:30.208 --> 02:32.125
[Eudoria] Right, ladies, to conclude:
our choices.

02:32.208 --> 02:33.958
The bankmen met,

02:34.416 --> 02:35.708
entangle herb,

02:37.458 --> 02:39.083
-Ellie Houseman.
-[woman] Ooh, marvelous.

02:39.166 --> 02:41.291
-[Eudoria] Are we all agreed? Yes?
-[women] Yes.

02:41.375 --> 02:43.000
[Eudoria] Ellie Houseman.

02:43.083 --> 02:44.041
[woman] Of course.

02:44.125 --> 02:45.041
[woman gasps]

02:48.041 --> 02:50.791
[Enola] Mother believed
privacy was the highest virtue,

02:51.166 --> 02:53.750
and the one most frequently violated.

02:55.041 --> 02:56.500
[birds chirping]

02:58.458 --> 02:59.666
[brakes squeal]

02:59.750 --> 03:01.750
Which leads me to the second thing
you need to know.

03:01.833 --> 03:02.666
[rooster crows]

03:02.750 --> 03:06.000
A week ago,
on the July morning of my 16th birthday,

03:06.083 --> 03:07.041
I awoke...

03:08.833 --> 03:09.666
Mother?

03:10.500 --> 03:12.416
...to find that my mother was missing.

03:13.666 --> 03:15.833
[breathing heavily]

03:16.541 --> 03:18.291
She'd left Ferndell Hall, our home,

03:19.208 --> 03:20.958
at some point during the night.

03:21.041 --> 03:22.208
Mother?

03:23.166 --> 03:24.750
And she did not return.

03:32.583 --> 03:33.916
[bicycle rattling]

03:34.000 --> 03:35.625
She left me with little, bar some gifts

03:35.708 --> 03:38.000
that she instructed Mrs. Lane
to give me at teatime.

03:49.750 --> 03:51.583
[Mrs. Lane] What kind gifts!

03:51.666 --> 03:54.000
And, look, she's made this herself.

03:56.666 --> 03:57.666
[Enola] We were happy.

03:57.750 --> 03:59.083
Weren't we, Mrs. Lane?

04:00.625 --> 04:02.833
Shouldn't she give me
these presents herself?

04:08.041 --> 04:10.125
-[lively music plays]
-[bicycle rattling]

04:15.000 --> 04:17.250
Oh, whoa! Whoa!

04:17.583 --> 04:18.458
[grunts]

04:18.958 --> 04:19.958
[pants]

04:20.500 --> 04:22.125
And the third thing you need to know,

04:22.208 --> 04:24.625
and there may be those amongst you
who have already guessed it,

04:24.708 --> 04:27.208
is that cycling
is not one of my core strengths,

04:27.291 --> 04:29.166
but needs must
when you must speed somewhere.

04:29.250 --> 04:30.500
[train whistling]

04:33.625 --> 04:35.250
[breathes heavily]

04:36.083 --> 04:37.416
[train whistling]

04:40.666 --> 04:42.000
The fourth thing you need to know

04:42.083 --> 04:44.708
is that I'm presently on the way
to collect my brothers,

04:45.041 --> 04:46.333
Mycroft and Sherlock,

04:46.791 --> 04:49.375
names which backwards spell out,
respectively,

04:49.458 --> 04:51.500
Tforcym and Kcolrehs.

04:53.958 --> 04:56.833
Perhaps one shouldn't read too much
into the "alone" idea.

05:01.291 --> 05:02.958
-[woman] Thank you.
-[Enola] Yes.

05:03.041 --> 05:04.416
Sherlock Holmes.

05:06.916 --> 05:09.375
The famous detective, scholar, chemist,

05:09.458 --> 05:11.041
virtuoso violinist,

05:11.458 --> 05:12.625
expert marksman,

05:12.708 --> 05:14.583
swordsman, singlestick fighter,

05:14.666 --> 05:15.583
pugilist,

05:16.041 --> 05:17.625
and brilliant deductive thinker.

05:19.041 --> 05:20.458
My genius brother.

05:22.083 --> 05:23.375
He will have all the answers.

05:23.458 --> 05:24.541
[inhales sharply]

05:24.625 --> 05:25.458
[clears throat]

05:31.333 --> 05:32.250
Mr. Holmes?

05:32.333 --> 05:35.125
And, um, Mr. Holmes?

05:35.208 --> 05:36.125
Yes.

05:36.625 --> 05:37.708
You sent for me?

05:39.583 --> 05:40.791
You sent a telegram.

05:41.833 --> 05:43.208
Asked me to meet you here?

05:46.458 --> 05:48.250
And the fifth thing you need to know

05:48.333 --> 05:50.833
is that they haven't seen me
in quite some time.

05:52.291 --> 05:53.291
Enola.

05:55.250 --> 05:56.500
My God.

05:57.291 --> 05:58.208
Look at you.

05:58.916 --> 06:00.541
You're in such a mess.

06:04.583 --> 06:06.083
Where's your hat and your gloves?

06:06.583 --> 06:07.916
Well, I have a hat.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.416
It just makes my head itch.
And I have no gloves.

06:11.041 --> 06:12.291
She has no gloves?

06:12.375 --> 06:13.625
Plainly not, Mycroft.

06:15.208 --> 06:18.000
We didn't send for you, silly girl.
We sent for the carriage.

06:18.416 --> 06:20.583
-Did you at least bring it?
-The carriage?

06:21.541 --> 06:22.375
Yes.

06:23.083 --> 06:26.208
What carriage would you be wanting?
Because I have a few in mind--

06:26.291 --> 06:28.208
The carriage I pay for.

06:29.166 --> 06:30.000
Right.

06:30.500 --> 06:33.625
I think you may have us confused
with another house.

06:36.750 --> 06:38.625
Boy, fetch us a carriage.

06:38.708 --> 06:39.583
Quickly!

06:41.833 --> 06:42.750
[Mycroft] Oh.

06:44.166 --> 06:45.208
What the...

06:45.291 --> 06:46.125
[Mycroft sighs]

06:46.541 --> 06:48.583
Oh, dear God, look at the house.

06:48.666 --> 06:49.500
[Enola gasps]

06:51.250 --> 06:52.958
[Enola] Isn't it wonderful?

06:55.291 --> 06:57.791
[Mycroft] What the hell
has she been playing at?

07:03.458 --> 07:05.791
[Mrs. Lane] Gentlemen, welcome home.

07:06.583 --> 07:07.958
It's been some time.

07:08.041 --> 07:09.458
[door creaks open]

07:21.791 --> 07:22.791
What is this?

07:24.708 --> 07:25.583
Tennis?

07:28.166 --> 07:30.250
Mother says I'm getting quite proficient.

07:31.291 --> 07:32.916
[effort grunts]

07:35.291 --> 07:36.125
-[glass shatters]
-Oh!

07:36.583 --> 07:38.333
[inhales through teeth]
I suppose that's game.

07:42.125 --> 07:43.125
[shuddering breath]

07:45.666 --> 07:46.583
[shuddering breaths]

07:47.791 --> 07:49.083
Where the hell is she?

07:54.291 --> 07:56.750
I would say this is going quite well,
wouldn't you?

07:58.166 --> 07:59.541
Her bed hasn't been made.

07:59.625 --> 08:01.250
Hmm. Chrysanthemums.

08:01.333 --> 08:03.000
[Mycroft] Clothes haven't been put away.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.750
And laurustinus, and Queen Anne's lace.

08:04.833 --> 08:06.791
[Mycroft] Enough with the bally flowers,
Sherlock.

08:10.375 --> 08:11.375
[Sherlock sighs]

08:13.000 --> 08:13.833
[Sherlock] Huh.

08:14.500 --> 08:15.708
But it wasn't foul play.

08:16.500 --> 08:18.458
How? Are you certain?

08:18.541 --> 08:20.916
Her regular supply of drawing pencils
has dwindled to nothing.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.375
She clearly had decided
not to replace them,

08:23.458 --> 08:25.083
and you rarely find that kidnap victims

08:25.166 --> 08:27.708
have planned for their own disappearance.
[chuckles]

08:27.791 --> 08:29.000
She wasn't returning,

08:29.583 --> 08:33.208
and yet she disguised her intentions
perfectly.

08:35.416 --> 08:36.916
That's good news, is it not?

08:38.083 --> 08:40.375
Depends if you're relying on her
coming back.

08:40.458 --> 08:41.333
[Mycroft] Hmm.

08:44.541 --> 08:46.750
[Mycroft] Oh, good God! Feminism.

08:47.875 --> 08:49.583
Perhaps she was mad, or senile.

08:50.958 --> 08:53.083
Though madness, in our family?
I would doubt it.

08:53.166 --> 08:55.458
-Ooh. [grunts]
-[Sherlock] I think I can surmise

08:55.541 --> 08:57.583
by the way that she left
leaving no clear leads,

08:57.666 --> 08:59.583
she still had her full wits
about her. [sniffs]

08:59.666 --> 09:03.291
No madwoman could compile the accounts
she sent me over the last ten years.

09:03.375 --> 09:06.125
Perfectly clear and orderly,
detailing a bathroom...

09:06.208 --> 09:08.208
-Which does not exist.
-[Mycroft] And a water closet.

09:08.291 --> 09:09.291
Likewise.

09:09.375 --> 09:11.041
[Mycroft]
And the constantly rising salaries

09:11.125 --> 09:13.250
of the footmen, the housemaids,
the kitchen maids,

09:13.333 --> 09:15.375
-gardeners, under gardeners...
-You get the point.

09:15.458 --> 09:17.125
...and for Enola, a music teacher,

09:17.208 --> 09:19.166
a dance instructor, a governess.

09:19.250 --> 09:21.083
Enola, you at least had a governess?

09:23.375 --> 09:24.583
She wouldn't like you in here.

09:25.166 --> 09:26.541
This is her private space.

09:28.583 --> 09:31.208
Tell me, she at least saw
that you had an education?

09:32.250 --> 09:33.375
She valued education.

09:33.791 --> 09:34.666
[scoffs]

09:35.583 --> 09:37.166
She taught me herself.

09:39.833 --> 09:42.541
She made me read every book
in Ferndell Hall's library.

09:45.708 --> 09:47.708
Shakespeare, Locke,

09:48.875 --> 09:50.458
and the encyclopedia,

09:50.750 --> 09:54.541
and Thackeray, and the essays
of Mary Wollstonecraft.

09:55.375 --> 09:57.083
And I did it on my own account.

09:58.083 --> 09:59.083
For my own learning.

10:00.041 --> 10:02.666
Which, Mother said, was the best way
to become a young...

10:04.166 --> 10:05.041
woman.

10:05.125 --> 10:07.291
Well, this is what
she wanted you to become?

10:07.375 --> 10:08.833
-Mycroft.
-What?

10:10.500 --> 10:12.250
I don't know what she wanted me to be.

10:13.500 --> 10:14.750
She's left me too.

10:17.333 --> 10:18.208
[scoffs]

10:21.875 --> 10:23.750
She will return, won't she, Sherlock?

10:25.041 --> 10:26.291
[inhales deeply]

10:29.166 --> 10:30.083
Won't she?

10:35.250 --> 10:37.125
[Mycroft] What is she up to, Sherlock?

10:37.208 --> 10:40.583
She was too old to remarry, she had
no passions or ambitions I was aware of.

10:41.125 --> 10:43.791
She simply had to ensure Enola
a decent life

10:43.875 --> 10:46.750
and to live her remaining years
with dignity.

10:47.875 --> 10:51.250
This is my house, not hers,
and has been since Father died.

10:51.333 --> 10:53.875
She asked for 16 years
to bring up Enola here.

10:53.958 --> 10:56.333
I gave it. And for that,
I deserve to be robbed?

10:56.416 --> 10:58.500
I am not the villain here.

10:58.583 --> 11:00.333
Perhaps she needed the money.

11:01.333 --> 11:02.375
You clearly don't,

11:02.458 --> 11:04.666
-or has the government cut your salary?
-[Mycroft sighs]

11:05.125 --> 11:08.125
[Mycroft] It's always the same, isn't it?
Always the same.

11:08.833 --> 11:11.916
We don't see each other for months,
and then you blast in without a care

11:12.000 --> 11:13.916
and condemn me with your bon mots.

11:14.666 --> 11:16.625
-Simply inquiring.
-You are judging.

11:16.708 --> 11:19.833
You are judging something
for which you took no responsibility.

11:21.583 --> 11:23.916
You've never shown an interest
in this family.

11:27.041 --> 11:28.583
[Sherlock] I don't mean to judge.

11:31.916 --> 11:33.875
We have two problems, as I see it.

11:34.458 --> 11:37.041
One, finding a boarding school

11:37.125 --> 11:38.833
that is willing to take Enola on

11:38.916 --> 11:42.458
so she won't be a complete failure
in this world.

11:44.125 --> 11:46.333
That I am in the process of solving...

11:47.708 --> 11:49.500
with the help of an old friend.

11:49.791 --> 11:51.208
[brakes screech]

11:54.125 --> 11:56.208
And two, finding Mother.

11:57.958 --> 12:00.708
The first is my problem,
the second I consider yours.

12:01.208 --> 12:02.208
My dear!

12:02.708 --> 12:04.291
-Oh!
-[Mycroft chuckling] My dear!

12:04.666 --> 12:06.000
Ooh. [chuckles]

12:06.083 --> 12:07.416
-[Mycroft] Let me.
-[sighs]

12:07.916 --> 12:11.333
A motor car.
How delightful, Miss Harrison.

12:11.416 --> 12:14.041
[Miss Harrison]
Well, I am an educator, Mr. Holmes.

12:14.416 --> 12:16.125
I like to keep ahead of the times.

12:16.916 --> 12:19.000
Enola may prefer to stay here.

12:19.583 --> 12:21.083
You could acquire a governess.

12:21.750 --> 12:24.916
-She needs a firm hand, Sherlock.
-[Miss Harrison] Where is she?

12:25.000 --> 12:25.958
[Mycroft] She's inside,

12:26.041 --> 12:28.625
though I must warn you in advance,
she's unbroken.

12:28.708 --> 12:31.208
[Miss Harrison chuckles]
We'll soon see about that.

12:31.583 --> 12:33.583
We need to break her and build her up.

12:34.541 --> 12:36.583
-[Miss Harrison] Stand tall, girl.
-[door closes]

12:37.000 --> 12:37.875
That's better.

12:37.958 --> 12:40.708
In Mother's absence,
she is my ward, not yours.

12:40.791 --> 12:43.208
-[seamstress] Waist, 24 inches.
-[Miss Harrison chuckles]

12:43.291 --> 12:45.500
-[seamstress] Chest, 33 inches.
-Well, that's too small.

12:45.583 --> 12:46.708
They are perfectly fine.

12:46.791 --> 12:48.125
[seamstress] Hips, 35 inches.

12:48.208 --> 12:49.583
Oh, how disappointing.

12:49.666 --> 12:51.458
We will have to use an amplifier.

12:51.541 --> 12:56.375
A wild and dangerous woman
brought up a wild child.

12:56.458 --> 12:57.833
She seems intelligent.

12:57.916 --> 13:00.291
Hips are simply a function of legs,
aren't they?

13:00.708 --> 13:02.250
What need have they of amplification?

13:02.333 --> 13:04.416
Aren't you the clever little tongue?
I'll enjoy that.

13:04.500 --> 13:07.958
I won't enjoy being imprisoned
in those preposterous clothes.

13:08.041 --> 13:10.791
These clothes will not imprison.
They will free.

13:11.416 --> 13:16.083
They will allow you to fit into society,
to take part in its numerous pleasures.

13:16.166 --> 13:17.916
To catch an eye, to attract.

13:18.500 --> 13:21.708
With Miss Harrison's help,
we'll make her acceptable for society.

13:21.791 --> 13:23.958
Father would be turning in his grave.

13:24.041 --> 13:25.625
[Miss Harrison] At my finishing school,

13:25.708 --> 13:28.041
you will learn how to be a young lady,

13:28.125 --> 13:31.083
and you'll make many new friends.

13:32.250 --> 13:35.000
I don't need friends.
I have my own company.

13:35.083 --> 13:37.708
[Mycroft] An unedcated, underdressed,

13:37.791 --> 13:39.375
poorly mannered wildling.

13:39.458 --> 13:41.916
And I don't need to go
to your ridiculous school.

13:42.958 --> 13:43.791
[Enola grunts]

13:45.708 --> 13:47.708
[panting]

13:49.625 --> 13:50.458
[sighs]

13:50.541 --> 13:52.833
[Enola] No! Please don't do this to me.

13:53.250 --> 13:55.208
Let me remain happy. I am happy here.

13:55.291 --> 13:58.333
You are a young woman now, Enola.
You need an education.

13:58.750 --> 14:01.208
Test me on anything you think
I need to know

14:01.291 --> 14:03.625
-to be sufficient for this world.
-If she taught you so well,

14:03.708 --> 14:06.708
you wouldn't be standing
in your undergarments in front of me.

14:06.791 --> 14:09.208
You have no hope of making a husband
in your current state.

14:09.291 --> 14:10.791
I don't want a husband!

14:10.875 --> 14:14.125
And that is another thing
you need to have educated out of you.

14:16.958 --> 14:18.083
[Enola whispers] Sherlock.

14:19.458 --> 14:22.250
-Don't let him do this to me.
-You are his ward.

14:22.333 --> 14:23.583
Make me yours.

14:24.041 --> 14:25.541
Guide me. Teach me.

14:25.625 --> 14:27.791
-For him, I am a nuisance. For you--
-Enola.

14:31.291 --> 14:32.291
I'm sorry.

14:33.375 --> 14:34.458
It's out of my hands.

14:35.625 --> 14:38.500
Just like his cruelty to our mother
was out of your hands.

14:39.791 --> 14:41.333
She is not dangerous.

14:41.416 --> 14:44.375
She is remarkable and always has been.

14:44.833 --> 14:48.000
And if you still can't see that,
then shame on you both!

14:48.583 --> 14:50.958
So remarkable that she left you
in my care.

14:51.041 --> 14:52.583
[footsteps approaching]

14:54.125 --> 14:58.708
Well, we have had a lovely little chat,
haven't we?

14:59.500 --> 15:01.708
I can tell we're going to be firm friends.

15:01.791 --> 15:04.500
Oh, Miss Harrison,
I'm so grateful for your kindness.

15:06.541 --> 15:07.416
Mr. Holmes,

15:08.458 --> 15:09.291
it's an honor.

15:10.166 --> 15:12.375
I shall bring her tomorrow myself.

15:12.791 --> 15:13.833
[Miss Harrison] Yourself?

15:15.000 --> 15:15.833
Good.

15:21.125 --> 15:21.958
[sighs]

15:22.500 --> 15:23.875
[birds chirping]

15:32.416 --> 15:34.000
[Sherlock] I also enjoy a sketch.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.125
[Sherlock sighs]

15:36.208 --> 15:37.041
Helps me think,

15:37.583 --> 15:38.750
process my thoughts.

15:40.291 --> 15:41.541
Helps me do the same.

15:44.166 --> 15:45.125
[Enola grunts]

15:46.708 --> 15:47.583
[Enola sighs]

15:52.458 --> 15:54.083
[chuckles]

15:54.875 --> 15:55.875
A caricature.

15:56.750 --> 15:58.375
Perhaps best if Mycroft doesn't see it.

16:00.458 --> 16:03.416
-Do you intend to stay up there?
-I was hoping for some privacy.

16:04.125 --> 16:07.375
[Sherlock] You know, last I remember,
you were quite a timid little thing.

16:08.208 --> 16:09.708
You had a pine cone wrapped in wool,

16:10.416 --> 16:11.916
dragged it with you wherever you went,

16:12.458 --> 16:13.541
calling it Dash.

16:16.333 --> 16:19.125
Someone told you that Queen Victoria
had a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel

16:19.208 --> 16:20.125
called Dash,

16:20.208 --> 16:22.041
and you decided you wanted the same.

16:24.791 --> 16:25.833
We could never persuade you

16:25.916 --> 16:27.833
-to put any trousers on.
-[Enola gasps]

16:27.916 --> 16:29.375
Your bottom was always bare.

16:29.458 --> 16:30.416
[Sherlock chuckles]

16:32.375 --> 16:34.791
-[Enola grunts]
-I think that's all the memories I have.

16:34.875 --> 16:35.791
[Enola] Thank you.

16:36.708 --> 16:38.541
If you could now forget them all.

16:40.833 --> 16:43.375
A pine cone called Dash?

16:44.208 --> 16:45.833
That sounds ridiculous.

16:45.916 --> 16:48.000
Father used to chase you
all about the place, shouting,

16:48.083 --> 16:50.625
-"Get that damn dog out of my house!"
-[chuckles]

16:54.333 --> 16:56.458
[sighs] Why did you never visit?

16:57.625 --> 16:58.458
[sighs]

17:00.416 --> 17:01.375
I lead a busy life.

17:03.708 --> 17:04.541
[sighs]

17:06.125 --> 17:07.791
[grunts] Why did you never write?

17:08.791 --> 17:10.291
Would you have cared for my letters?

17:15.708 --> 17:19.250
I have kept every clipping
of every case of yours I could ever find.

17:19.625 --> 17:20.750
That's flattering.

17:20.833 --> 17:23.791
And yet it took our mother's disappearance
to bring you home.

17:26.500 --> 17:27.500
She meant to go.

17:29.333 --> 17:30.583
She's not coming back.

17:31.500 --> 17:32.333
No.

17:33.625 --> 17:36.583
But the truth is,
Mother always had a reason for everything.

17:37.250 --> 17:38.833
Her own way of doing things.

17:39.291 --> 17:42.916
And those kind of mysteries
are always the most satisfying to unpick.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.958
I don't want a mystery, Sherlock.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.083
I want my mother back here
and my life as it was.

17:49.166 --> 17:50.250
You're being emotional.

17:51.541 --> 17:52.416
It's understandable,

17:53.333 --> 17:54.333
but unnecessary.

17:56.291 --> 17:57.166
[sighs]

17:58.125 --> 17:59.250
Look for what's there,

18:00.291 --> 18:02.125
not what you want to be there.

18:03.791 --> 18:05.458
You'll see the truth soon enough.

18:07.000 --> 18:07.833
[sighs]

18:10.208 --> 18:12.125
"Own way of doing things..."

18:12.208 --> 18:14.041
And, look, she's made this herself.

18:26.958 --> 18:27.875
[frustrated grunt]

18:38.791 --> 18:39.708
"Alone."

18:41.666 --> 18:42.875
That's my name.

18:44.583 --> 18:46.333
M... S...

18:46.958 --> 18:47.958
A...

18:48.458 --> 18:49.291
C.

18:51.250 --> 18:52.416
Try it backwards.

18:53.958 --> 18:54.791
Bear with me.

18:56.083 --> 18:58.250
[sighs] "Chrysanthemums...

18:58.666 --> 19:00.625
my in look...

19:00.708 --> 19:01.666
Enola."

19:11.208 --> 19:12.500
I hear you, Mother.

19:15.958 --> 19:16.916
[floor creaking]

19:21.375 --> 19:24.083
[whispering] Chrysanthemums,
chrysanthemums...

19:25.416 --> 19:28.583
"The bestowing of chrysanthemums
indicates familial attachment

19:28.666 --> 19:30.916
and, by implication, affection."

19:35.666 --> 19:36.541
[sniffs]

19:39.333 --> 19:40.500
[sighs]

19:44.500 --> 19:46.333
"My chrysanthemums."

19:47.208 --> 19:48.291
[gasps]

19:49.458 --> 19:51.000
Not the ones she bought.

19:52.250 --> 19:54.541
The ones she painted. [gasps]

20:06.083 --> 20:08.875
Money. She must have left a message.

20:14.041 --> 20:15.875
"Our future is up to us."

20:16.958 --> 20:18.125
What future?

20:19.083 --> 20:21.083
There are two paths you can take, Enola.

20:21.541 --> 20:22.375
Yours...

20:23.333 --> 20:25.541
or the path others choose for you.

20:31.458 --> 20:33.000
"Our future is up to us."

20:34.125 --> 20:34.958
[chuckles]

20:36.083 --> 20:37.041
[Enola sighs]

20:38.708 --> 20:42.166
Mother was able to vanish from Ferndell,
and so must I,

20:42.750 --> 20:45.500
in the clothes
Sherlock himself grew up in.

20:51.875 --> 20:53.333
It's a necessary distraction.

20:53.958 --> 20:55.666
I was just beginning to master it.

20:56.583 --> 20:58.500
Phase one of the plan complete.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.541
I'm coming to find you, Mother.

21:01.250 --> 21:02.708
The game is afoot.

21:10.000 --> 21:10.958
[train whistles]

21:13.541 --> 21:15.541
I couldn't go to my local station,
of course,

21:15.625 --> 21:17.708
so I chose a different line altogether.

21:18.125 --> 21:20.791
With my brothers after me,
there's no telling where they'd search.

21:23.083 --> 21:24.041
[whistle blows]

21:24.125 --> 21:25.958
[policeman] No sign of him anywhere, sir.

21:27.291 --> 21:29.541
[Lady Tewkesbury] I want an assurance
that my son is not--

21:29.625 --> 21:31.250
[police commander] He's not on this train.

21:31.333 --> 21:34.375
Of course he's on the train!
You simply haven't looked properly.

21:34.458 --> 21:38.000
Sir, I've had my officers search
this train from top to bottom.

21:38.083 --> 21:40.375
-Darling, perhaps we should just--
-Quiet, Mother.

21:40.458 --> 21:43.875
He had the carriage drop him here
this morning. He must be here somewhere.

21:43.958 --> 21:46.583
Well, we're not even sure
the darling boy's on the train.

21:46.666 --> 21:48.500
I'm so sorry. This is such a fuss.

21:48.875 --> 21:51.958
[station master] This train must leave.
We're running extremely late.

21:52.041 --> 21:55.333
-You don't understand. This is my son.
-It leaves now.

21:55.416 --> 21:56.250
[whistle blows]

21:56.333 --> 21:58.458
Don't let this train leave
without someone on it!

21:58.541 --> 22:00.000
-[conductor] All aboard!
-I insist!

22:02.250 --> 22:03.625
[train whistling]

22:19.916 --> 22:22.375
[train whistling]

22:23.666 --> 22:25.666
-[Mycroft] Enola! Time to go!
-[knocks]

22:25.750 --> 22:27.458
[knocking]

22:27.541 --> 22:29.500
Enola, the carriage is waiting.

22:29.583 --> 22:30.708
[door opens]

22:32.166 --> 22:33.041
Enola?

22:43.958 --> 22:46.291
Sherlock!

22:46.375 --> 22:47.541
[train whistles]

23:00.666 --> 23:01.541
[thudding]

23:02.416 --> 23:03.625
[sneezing]

23:08.375 --> 23:09.250
[grunts]

23:10.166 --> 23:11.500
[fabric tearing]

23:19.250 --> 23:20.083
[effort grunts]

23:22.625 --> 23:23.750
[grunts] Whoa!

23:24.166 --> 23:25.166
[thuds]

23:25.250 --> 23:26.125
[groans]

23:26.750 --> 23:28.416
[pained grunts]

23:31.000 --> 23:31.833
Hello.

23:34.250 --> 23:36.708
-Please get out of this carriage.
-I can't.

23:36.791 --> 23:38.333
I'm in hiding.

23:39.083 --> 23:42.416
Bit of a to-do. Bribed a porter
to put me in this and get me onboard.

23:42.500 --> 23:43.375
[inhales sharply]

23:43.458 --> 23:44.458
Very daring.

23:44.541 --> 23:46.708
Get out of this carriage right now.

23:48.708 --> 23:49.666
You're a...

23:50.458 --> 23:52.000
a strange-looking gentleman.

23:52.458 --> 23:53.625
You think you look normal?

23:53.708 --> 23:54.708
You're not a boy at all.

23:55.458 --> 23:56.291
I might be a boy.

23:56.375 --> 23:57.875
-Who are you?
-What are you?

23:59.166 --> 24:00.708
I'm Viscount Tewkesbury,

24:00.791 --> 24:02.416
the Marquess of Basilwether.

24:03.041 --> 24:04.208
You're a nincompoop.

24:06.916 --> 24:10.125
I'll have you know, I have just undertaken
a particularly daring escape--

24:10.208 --> 24:12.708
You have not escaped.
There is a man in a brown bowler hat

24:12.791 --> 24:15.375
currently on this train searching for you,
and once he finds you,

24:15.458 --> 24:18.291
he will think I helped hide you,
and I will be endangered by this.

24:18.375 --> 24:20.875
Therefore, I ask you
to get out of this carriage.

24:27.041 --> 24:28.458
You remind me of my uncle.

24:28.541 --> 24:30.083
I've left him at the station.

24:30.166 --> 24:33.000
Of course he's on the train.
You simply haven't looked properly.

24:34.041 --> 24:35.458
[Tewkesbury] He's bossy too.

24:36.208 --> 24:38.291
Left them all: my mother, my grandmother.

24:38.708 --> 24:40.708
But I'm fine. I'm free.

24:41.208 --> 24:42.041
Good.

24:42.708 --> 24:44.208
Get out of the carriage, then.

24:48.333 --> 24:49.750
A man in a brown bowler hat?

24:50.833 --> 24:51.791
[breathes heavily]

24:57.166 --> 24:58.083
It'll be fine.

24:58.166 --> 25:00.000
[breathes deeply]

25:00.083 --> 25:00.916
It'll be fine.

25:04.166 --> 25:05.041
[sighs]

25:09.791 --> 25:11.291
-[Tewkesbury] He's coming!
-Of course.

25:11.375 --> 25:13.541
-He's checking every carriage.
-[Enola] Wonderful.

25:13.625 --> 25:14.833
You have to help me.

25:15.583 --> 25:17.750
-[breathes heavily] He didn't see me.
-Of course he did.

25:17.833 --> 25:19.125
Therefore, I say good day to you,

25:19.208 --> 25:21.416
Viscount Tewkesbury,
Marquess of Basilwether.

25:24.750 --> 25:27.916
You really do remind me of my uncle.
You have that same stare.

25:29.166 --> 25:30.000
[sighs]

25:37.666 --> 25:38.833
[breathes deeply]

25:38.916 --> 25:41.041
Ah, there you are, sir.

25:41.875 --> 25:42.958
[struggling grunts]

25:43.666 --> 25:45.083
[struggling grunts continue]

25:47.500 --> 25:49.583
[Eudoria] Paint your own picture, Enola.

25:49.666 --> 25:52.000
Don't be thrown off course
by other people.

25:52.708 --> 25:53.791
Especially men!

25:55.750 --> 25:56.708
[sighs]

25:58.750 --> 25:59.583
[exhales sharply]

26:03.958 --> 26:05.291
[struggling grunts]

26:06.916 --> 26:07.833
Aah!

26:10.583 --> 26:11.458
[grunts]

26:11.916 --> 26:13.583
[struggling grunts]

26:13.666 --> 26:14.583
[yells] Help!

26:15.250 --> 26:16.083
Help!

26:16.458 --> 26:17.291
Help!

26:17.375 --> 26:18.625
Somebody help me!

26:18.708 --> 26:20.000
[train whistles]

26:20.083 --> 26:21.125
Help!

26:21.208 --> 26:22.833
-[Enola yells]
-[Tewkesbury] Aah!

26:23.208 --> 26:24.583
Oh! Oh!

26:26.166 --> 26:27.208
[breathing heavily]

26:27.625 --> 26:28.833
Oh! Aah!

26:28.916 --> 26:31.291
[yelling]

26:35.291 --> 26:37.333
[breathing heavily]

26:38.583 --> 26:40.750
[Tewkesbury] Who is that?
He was trying to kill me!

26:40.833 --> 26:42.125
I'm not ready to die on a train.

26:42.208 --> 26:44.666
I'm not ready to die at all.
I wasn't going to before I met you.

26:47.333 --> 26:50.458
-[Tewkesbury] Where are we going?
-[Enola] I don't know yet. Let me think.

26:50.541 --> 26:51.666
[woman gasping]

26:52.833 --> 26:53.666
Terribly sorry.

26:55.375 --> 26:56.208
[gasps]

26:56.625 --> 26:58.041
[train whistling]

27:10.666 --> 27:12.125
[screeching]

27:12.208 --> 27:15.416
-Is this truly the best way to come?
-Can you think of a better way?

27:18.166 --> 27:19.791
[breathes heavily]

27:22.333 --> 27:23.166
[shudders]

27:27.833 --> 27:28.750
[breathes heavily]

27:41.666 --> 27:42.833
Do you trust me?

27:43.625 --> 27:45.041
-No!
-[breathes heavily]

27:49.458 --> 27:50.708
If we time it correctly,

27:50.791 --> 27:53.208
-we can leave him stranded.
-Time what correctly?

27:58.791 --> 28:00.875
-[woman screams]
-[Enola] Listen, Tewkesbury.

28:00.958 --> 28:01.916
We have two choices.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
And which one involves me not dying?

28:09.041 --> 28:10.083
This one!

28:10.166 --> 28:11.166
[Tewkesbury screams]

28:13.375 --> 28:15.625
[grunting]

28:20.333 --> 28:21.625
[panting]

28:21.708 --> 28:22.750
[train whistling]

28:22.833 --> 28:24.083
[Tewkesbury panting]

28:24.166 --> 28:27.083
-[Enola panting]
-[Tewkesbury grunting]

28:28.208 --> 28:29.166
[Tewkesbury groans]

28:30.375 --> 28:31.208
Aah!

28:31.291 --> 28:34.500
[Tewkesbury breathing heavily
and grunting]

28:35.166 --> 28:37.166
[breathing heavily]

28:37.250 --> 28:39.333
You do make an awful lot of noise,
don't you?

28:40.333 --> 28:42.583
Well, it turns out,
being thrown off a train

28:42.666 --> 28:44.625
hurts considerably more
than you might think.

28:44.708 --> 28:45.875
[Tewkesbury exhales sharply]

28:45.958 --> 28:47.125
And I've lost a button.

28:49.500 --> 28:51.583
[train whistling]

28:55.333 --> 28:57.166
[Sherlock] So now we've lost them both.

28:58.333 --> 29:01.833
I presume they have no clue
as to where she's gone, Mrs. Lane?

29:01.916 --> 29:03.333
No, they found her bicycle.

29:03.416 --> 29:05.250
Planted so as to send us
in the wrong direction.

29:05.958 --> 29:08.958
This isn't as fun as you might think,
Master Sherlock.

29:09.958 --> 29:11.000
She has your wits.

29:11.458 --> 29:14.583
She runs rings around me
just as easily as you once did, but...

29:16.041 --> 29:18.458
-Yes?
-She knows nothing of the world.

29:20.083 --> 29:23.458
I must admit to being
quite seriously concerned for her.

29:23.541 --> 29:25.041
Mycroft will make sure to find her.

29:25.125 --> 29:27.375
[Mrs. Lane] Well, Mycroft isn't blessed
as you are.

29:27.458 --> 29:28.375
As she is.

29:29.250 --> 29:30.750
A matter of great bitterness for him

29:30.833 --> 29:33.166
and not a small part
of the cause of this mess.

29:34.916 --> 29:36.166
Enola is special.

29:37.125 --> 29:38.583
She has such a good heart.

29:39.791 --> 29:42.333
She's even left money on my bedside table.

29:42.416 --> 29:43.291
Money?

29:45.583 --> 29:47.541
You've already abandoned her once, sir.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.166
I'm asking
that you don't abandon her again.

29:52.833 --> 29:54.166
[footsteps receding]

30:04.916 --> 30:08.166
[Enola] You do know you've entirely ruined
phase three of my plan?

30:08.250 --> 30:10.833
[Tewkesbury] Phase what?
Who the hell are you?

30:12.666 --> 30:14.333
Look, I believe our recent
brush with death

30:14.416 --> 30:15.500
deserves me at least a name.

30:15.583 --> 30:16.875
Enola Holmes.

30:18.208 --> 30:19.916
Holmes... Like Sherlock?

30:20.541 --> 30:23.916
And I am undercover, so forget I told you
that piece of information.

30:24.250 --> 30:27.125
-Undercover working for him?
-Undercover from him.

30:28.166 --> 30:31.666
-Hence why you're dressed as a boy--
-Hence why you are to say nothing.

30:35.000 --> 30:35.833
So?

30:38.083 --> 30:39.000
What?

30:41.333 --> 30:42.250
Thank you?

30:43.041 --> 30:44.875
You're supposed to say thank you.

30:44.958 --> 30:45.833
For what?

30:51.791 --> 30:53.583
[animal bleating in the distance]

31:00.958 --> 31:01.833
[Enola sighs]

31:01.916 --> 31:03.750
[Enola] We should think
about sleeping soon.

31:04.291 --> 31:06.083
[Tewkesbury] We should think
about eating soon.

31:07.541 --> 31:09.000
[Enola] We have nothing to eat.

31:09.666 --> 31:11.000
[Tewkesbury] Of course we do.

31:11.500 --> 31:14.333
Arctium lappa,
which you'll know as burdock.

31:15.333 --> 31:16.250
Very tasty.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.500
Um, and then there's Trifolium.

31:20.000 --> 31:20.916
Clover.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.166
And is that...

31:22.250 --> 31:23.833
[chuckles] Yes, I knew it!

31:25.041 --> 31:25.916
Mushrooms!

31:26.916 --> 31:28.166
Agaricus lanipes.

31:28.958 --> 31:30.083
The Princess.

31:31.250 --> 31:32.083
Delicious.

31:33.250 --> 31:34.958
If you can get a fire started,

31:35.041 --> 31:36.375
I can make us a feast.

31:38.333 --> 31:39.166
Fine.

31:40.000 --> 31:40.833
[sighs]

31:44.833 --> 31:46.666
I'm not entirely an idiot, you know.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.333
[fire crackling]

31:58.166 --> 31:59.041
[Enola] Hmm.

31:59.958 --> 32:02.875
I've been thinking.
You need to disguise yourself a little.

32:03.333 --> 32:06.041
-How do you feel about your hair?
-I've never cared for it.

32:10.333 --> 32:12.625
Cut it off with a knife.
Of course you will.

32:17.250 --> 32:18.916
Who taught you
how to sharpen it like that?

32:20.500 --> 32:21.375
My mother.

32:22.958 --> 32:24.791
Your mother is very different to mine.

32:24.875 --> 32:25.791
[both chuckle]

32:26.750 --> 32:29.333
-Who taught you about flowers and herbs?
-My father.

32:30.750 --> 32:32.541
[Enola] I never really knew my father.

32:33.166 --> 32:34.208
My father's dead too.

32:37.250 --> 32:38.375
[both] I'm sorry.

32:41.041 --> 32:42.666
[sharpens knife]

32:44.541 --> 32:46.958
[Tewkesbury] Why have you run?
From home, I mean.

32:47.375 --> 32:50.916
I didn't want to go to Miss Harrison's
Finishing School for Young Ladies.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.250
[Tewkesbury chuckles]

32:52.333 --> 32:53.250
Why have you?

32:54.916 --> 32:55.750
Well, uh,

32:55.833 --> 32:59.250
a tree branch broke above me
while I was collecting wild mushrooms.

32:59.333 --> 33:01.791
It should have crushed me,
but I managed to roll out of the way,

33:01.875 --> 33:03.333
and I realized that...

33:04.291 --> 33:05.166
What?

33:05.666 --> 33:07.458
-You'll laugh at me.
-I won't.

33:10.875 --> 33:12.583
My life seemed to flash before me.

33:13.958 --> 33:16.083
I was just about to take my seat
in the House of Lords.

33:16.166 --> 33:19.458
I had these ideas
about how we might progress the estate.

33:20.083 --> 33:22.125
But my family were set
on me joining the army

33:22.208 --> 33:24.375
and then going overseas,
just like my uncle.

33:26.375 --> 33:27.791
And I realized I was scared,

33:27.875 --> 33:30.958
scared I would hate every second
of the rest of my life.

33:33.916 --> 33:35.041
Why would I laugh at that?

33:35.125 --> 33:36.791
-Don't I sound pathetic?
-No.

33:40.625 --> 33:43.041
Why were they going to send you
to the finishing school?

33:46.416 --> 33:47.291
[Enola sighs]

33:47.791 --> 33:49.416
In the morning, we'll have to move fast.

33:49.500 --> 33:51.208
The bowler hat man
will be hot on your tail--

33:51.291 --> 33:53.291
Where's your destination? I'm going to--

33:53.375 --> 33:54.208
London.

33:55.708 --> 33:56.666
[Tewkesbury chuckles]

33:57.375 --> 33:58.375
Well, then,

33:58.833 --> 34:00.833
shall we, um, stick together?

34:02.958 --> 34:04.416
If you like. [slight chuckle]

34:05.333 --> 34:06.333
No.

34:07.166 --> 34:09.166
We'll get to London
and go our separate ways.

34:09.250 --> 34:10.500
-Understood?
-[inhales deeply]

34:10.583 --> 34:11.958
Understood. [clears throat]

34:12.750 --> 34:14.500
Totally. [pained grunt] Entirely.

34:15.333 --> 34:17.750
Do you have to be quite so brutal
with the hair?

34:17.833 --> 34:18.666
[Enola] Yes.

34:22.416 --> 34:23.791
[sheep bleating]

34:23.875 --> 34:25.750
-Well, you would say that.
-[chuckles]

34:26.125 --> 34:27.083
[both laugh]

34:31.916 --> 34:33.541
-[sheep bleating]
-[horses neighing]

34:33.625 --> 34:35.125
[people chattering]

34:35.208 --> 34:36.708
[geese honking]

34:38.250 --> 34:39.333
[sheep bleating]

34:44.375 --> 34:47.000
-Oh, so this is where we part?
-[Enola] It is.

34:49.750 --> 34:52.291
Then, thank you, Enola Holmes,
for helping me here.

34:53.875 --> 34:55.875
You were supposed to have forgotten
that name.

34:56.833 --> 34:58.500
Then you'll have to find another.

35:00.083 --> 35:01.166
[sheep bleating]

35:08.333 --> 35:09.250
He'll be fine.

35:13.458 --> 35:14.375
[Enola] London:

35:14.458 --> 35:15.916
the beating heart of England.

35:16.291 --> 35:18.041
Mother will be here somewhere,

35:18.125 --> 35:20.083
and though she prepared me
for many things...

35:20.166 --> 35:22.500
[Eudoria] Oh, you've time enough
for the world.

35:22.583 --> 35:23.958
Let it do its damage later.

35:24.041 --> 35:25.083
[horses whinnying]

35:25.166 --> 35:27.250
...the outside world was not one of them.

35:29.375 --> 35:32.083
And yet here I am,
at the center of civilization.

35:33.541 --> 35:35.333
The home of polite society...

35:35.416 --> 35:37.250
[man] Out of the sodding way, boy!

35:37.333 --> 35:38.333
[Enola] ...of music,

35:39.166 --> 35:40.000
of literature...

35:40.083 --> 35:42.916
Lords debate reform bill!
Case of the missing marquess!

35:43.000 --> 35:44.875
[Enola] And the finest things
that money can buy.

35:44.958 --> 35:46.333
-A shilling apiece!
-[yelps]

35:46.416 --> 35:47.250
A shilling apiece!

35:50.208 --> 35:53.291
[Enola] I must admit,
London isn't quite what I imagined.

35:53.666 --> 35:56.583
People are a lot more... excitable
than in the country.

35:56.666 --> 35:58.000
[man 1] Without this reform,

35:58.083 --> 36:01.583
-this country isn't ours, it's theirs.
-[crowd cheering]

36:01.666 --> 36:04.291
We must petition the Lords.

36:04.375 --> 36:07.583
And we've not only got to do it
for ourselves, but for our children!

36:08.125 --> 36:09.750
[man 2] Vote for change!

36:09.833 --> 36:13.583
So if I am to fit in
and stay hidden from my brothers,

36:15.666 --> 36:17.000
I must become something...

36:18.291 --> 36:19.250
unexpected.

36:19.333 --> 36:21.750
[man 1] This is our chance!
Demand the vote!

36:21.833 --> 36:23.083
Vote for all men!

36:23.166 --> 36:24.875
-[crowd cheering]
-Vote for all men!

36:29.041 --> 36:32.041
No one on the trains,
no one on the boats,

36:32.625 --> 36:33.958
no one anywhere.

36:34.791 --> 36:36.250
The girl has simply vanished.

36:37.250 --> 36:38.750
Of course, it doesn't help

36:38.833 --> 36:43.000
that England's suddenly consumed
by this ridiculous marquess.

36:43.458 --> 36:44.291
[attendant] Sir?

36:44.375 --> 36:46.083
-Sherry, please.
-[attendant] Certainly, sir.

36:46.166 --> 36:47.958
You haven't been offered it, have you?

36:48.041 --> 36:48.916
What?

36:49.791 --> 36:51.083
The marquess case.

36:53.083 --> 36:55.208
I knew his father, obnoxious sort.

36:55.791 --> 36:57.833
Liberal, but worth a fortune.

36:58.666 --> 37:00.625
I have, and I have refused it.

37:01.208 --> 37:03.083
I'm rather more consumed elsewhere.

37:03.416 --> 37:05.958
-Oh, in finding Mother?
-In finding our sister.

37:07.375 --> 37:08.208
No.

37:09.083 --> 37:09.958
No.

37:10.750 --> 37:13.416
Your job, I made clear,
was to find Mother.

37:13.500 --> 37:17.458
I'm looking for her too,
as will, no doubt, Enola.

37:22.041 --> 37:24.541
-You never cared about her before.
-She's only 16.

37:34.458 --> 37:36.375
You haven't given our name
in the search for her.

37:36.458 --> 37:37.500
Of course not.

37:37.583 --> 37:40.666
I don't want anyone knowing our business
any more than you do.

37:41.458 --> 37:43.083
Oh, don't worry, little brother.

37:43.541 --> 37:45.041
She may have escaped us for now,

37:45.125 --> 37:47.000
but I have the best police officers
in London

37:47.083 --> 37:49.291
looking for a child
matching her description.

37:50.708 --> 37:55.041
And they will find that stupid little girl
and bring her back to us.

37:59.041 --> 37:59.958
Reform.

38:01.125 --> 38:04.500
God help us. If there's one thing
this country doesn't need,

38:05.250 --> 38:07.833
it's more uneducated voters.

38:08.416 --> 38:10.291
England is going to pot.

38:10.375 --> 38:11.583
[snoring]

38:21.208 --> 38:23.625
And what does a boy like you
want with those?

38:27.375 --> 38:29.208
I shall need a whalebone corset.

38:29.833 --> 38:31.541
[Miss Gregory]
You shall need no such thing.

38:31.625 --> 38:33.291
This is a respectable shop.

38:33.958 --> 38:36.708
-Then I shall respect it.
-You don't look like you will.

38:36.791 --> 38:38.916
You don't smell like you will.

38:39.958 --> 38:40.791
And I--

38:40.875 --> 38:41.708
[gasps]

38:47.166 --> 38:48.833
Do you have anywhere I can dress?

38:49.333 --> 38:50.916
[shuddering]

38:52.583 --> 38:53.416
In the back.

38:57.333 --> 39:01.541
The corset: a symbol of repression
to those who are forced to wear it.

39:02.875 --> 39:04.333
But for me, who chooses to wear it,

39:04.416 --> 39:06.583
the bust enhancer and the hip regulators

39:07.125 --> 39:09.916
will hide the fortune
my mother has given me.

39:10.750 --> 39:12.000
And as they do so,

39:12.541 --> 39:15.500
they will make me look
like that truly unlikely thing:

39:17.250 --> 39:18.083
a lady!

39:24.083 --> 39:25.750
"You have to go to school, Enola!"

39:25.833 --> 39:28.583
"But I don't want to go
to a finishing school, Mycroft."

39:28.666 --> 39:30.583
"Well, what else
are we going to do with you?

39:30.666 --> 39:31.916
You're a girl!"

39:36.833 --> 39:38.958
Oh, come on, seriously?

39:41.708 --> 39:42.875
[gasps]

39:46.250 --> 39:48.416
Now, where might I find a lodging house?

39:49.250 --> 39:50.916
I'll pay handsomely for good value.

39:51.583 --> 39:53.000
[chuckles]

39:54.458 --> 39:55.875
Is this really good value?

39:55.958 --> 39:57.750
Oh, best value you'll find.

39:57.833 --> 39:59.875
You're lucky you found me.

40:01.166 --> 40:02.666
Here you have it.

40:02.750 --> 40:05.166
[voices yelling and arguing]

40:06.000 --> 40:08.291
[baby crying]

40:12.250 --> 40:13.208
[animal squeaking]

40:16.083 --> 40:17.958
[voices continue yelling and arguing]

40:20.250 --> 40:21.166
[nervous chuckle]

40:21.250 --> 40:22.666
[train whistling]

40:22.750 --> 40:23.708
It's lovely.

40:23.791 --> 40:25.750
[train chugging]

40:31.041 --> 40:34.000
[Enola] Now I've finally got
some peace and quiet to think,

40:34.083 --> 40:35.958
it's time for phase five of my plan.

40:38.625 --> 40:39.875
Or possibly phase four.

40:42.208 --> 40:43.375
Or possibly phase six.

40:43.458 --> 40:45.166
I've entirely lost count.

40:47.666 --> 40:49.416
It is time to find my mother.

40:49.833 --> 40:52.250
To find Mother, the first thing
I need to do is leave a cipher

40:52.333 --> 40:54.083
in every newspaper she might read.

40:55.416 --> 40:57.083
"Thank you, my chrysanthemum.

40:57.166 --> 41:00.166
Are you blooming? Send iris, please."

41:00.250 --> 41:01.708
Iris means "message."

41:02.875 --> 41:04.791
Now, how to disguise them?

41:05.291 --> 41:07.250
Mother can untangle anything,

41:07.750 --> 41:10.291
so I need to make it most devious.

41:12.625 --> 41:14.875
I placed it
in the personal advertisements column

41:14.958 --> 41:16.375
of The Pall Mall Gazette,

41:16.458 --> 41:18.291
which my mother seldom missed.

41:19.250 --> 41:21.250
Plus the Magazine of Modern Womanhood...

41:21.583 --> 41:22.708
[typewriter clacking]

41:23.708 --> 41:25.500
...and The Journal of Dress Reform...

41:27.958 --> 41:30.375
two publications
I thought might tickle her.

41:33.791 --> 41:35.875
This gentleman seems to be getting
a lot of attention.

41:35.958 --> 41:37.875
Well, he's a bloomin' marquess.

41:38.791 --> 41:41.250
[clears throat] Then I had to find out
who she really was.

41:41.333 --> 41:42.208
Is.

41:42.291 --> 41:43.125
Was.

41:43.583 --> 41:46.833
My mother only corresponded
with one address with regularity.

41:46.916 --> 41:49.000
It was wrong of me
to look where it was addressed to,

41:49.458 --> 41:51.916
and entirely wrong of me
to have memorized it.

41:52.000 --> 41:55.208
But when growing up in the countryside,
there is little excitement,

41:55.291 --> 41:57.875
so one clings to whatever narratives
one can get.

41:57.958 --> 41:59.250
[horses neighing]

41:59.333 --> 42:00.625
[people chattering]

42:06.583 --> 42:08.791
More macaroons, please, Jason.

42:13.833 --> 42:14.666
Afternoon.

42:14.750 --> 42:15.833
[waitress] Afternoon.

42:18.750 --> 42:19.708
[thud]

42:20.583 --> 42:21.958
-[thud]
-[chandelier rattles]

42:22.041 --> 42:23.000
What's up there?

42:23.333 --> 42:24.666
Noisy bloody women!

42:24.750 --> 42:26.333
[chuckles]

42:26.416 --> 42:27.750
-[thud]
-[chandelier rattles]

42:28.250 --> 42:30.708
[Edith] No, harder.
Don't be afraid of her.

42:31.125 --> 42:32.916
Step forward this time. Good.

42:34.541 --> 42:35.375
Good afternoon.

42:37.208 --> 42:39.416
-You wanting to be recruited?
-No.

42:39.500 --> 42:40.833
-[woman thuds and grunts]
-Uh...

42:40.916 --> 42:43.166
I'm looking for Eudoria Vernet Holmes.

42:44.541 --> 42:45.375
Enola?

42:46.250 --> 42:47.583
Enola Holmes.

42:47.666 --> 42:48.875
It is you, isn't it?

42:51.541 --> 42:53.541
Why are you dressed like a powder puff?

42:54.875 --> 42:56.208
Oh, my!

42:57.083 --> 42:58.583
You look the spit of her.

43:01.416 --> 43:02.583
You recognize me?

43:03.041 --> 43:04.000
Of course I do.

43:04.833 --> 43:06.375
I was your first teacher.

43:07.125 --> 43:08.125
Don't you remember?

43:09.041 --> 43:10.250
[Edith grunts]

43:11.125 --> 43:12.625
[Edith grunting]

43:12.708 --> 43:14.208
[chuckles]

43:14.291 --> 43:16.250
You've progressed nicely, I can see.

43:20.083 --> 43:21.958
You're alone? In London?

43:23.208 --> 43:24.041
Yes.

43:24.791 --> 43:27.208
There was a useless boy,
but I rid myself of him.

43:27.833 --> 43:28.791
[Edith] Hmm.

43:28.875 --> 43:31.333
I have money, lodgings.
I just need to find her.

43:32.166 --> 43:34.458
What makes you think
that she wants to be found?

43:35.666 --> 43:37.791
Eudoria's been hiding all her life.

43:38.291 --> 43:40.375
If she wants to stay hidden, she will.

43:41.541 --> 43:44.208
-And besides, she has work to do.
-What work?

43:46.083 --> 43:47.000
I cannot say.

43:49.458 --> 43:51.333
[Eudoria] Right, ladies, our choices:

43:52.000 --> 43:54.041
the bankmen met, entangle herb,

43:54.625 --> 43:56.083
or Ellie Houseman.

44:00.750 --> 44:02.750
[Enola] So you were at that meeting too.

44:03.083 --> 44:05.666
[Eudoria] So, we're all agreed?
Ellie Houseman.

44:06.625 --> 44:08.083
Who is Ellie Houseman?

44:12.375 --> 44:15.083
-I wish I could help you more.
-You can, but you won't.

44:15.791 --> 44:17.333
I must get back to my students.

44:17.416 --> 44:19.166
-You can see yourself out.
-Hey!

44:21.125 --> 44:22.791
[pained grunts]

44:23.500 --> 44:25.208
[effort grunts]

44:25.750 --> 44:27.458
[effort grunts]

44:28.541 --> 44:29.416
[Edith grunts]

44:30.458 --> 44:32.750
Ah, the corkscrew.

44:37.375 --> 44:39.333
You could never manage that one, could ya?

44:39.625 --> 44:40.458
[Edith sighs]

44:42.083 --> 44:43.541
If you wanna stay in London,

44:44.166 --> 44:45.291
be tough,

44:46.083 --> 44:47.083
be tough,

44:47.625 --> 44:48.625
live the life,

44:49.125 --> 44:51.083
but don't do it
because you're looking for someone.

44:51.708 --> 44:53.708
Do it because you're looking for yourself.

44:56.625 --> 44:58.083
[footsteps receding]

44:58.166 --> 44:59.250
[door opens]

45:00.833 --> 45:01.666
[door closes]

45:22.125 --> 45:23.375
[Eudoria] ...our choices:

45:24.250 --> 45:25.125
the bankmen met,

45:25.500 --> 45:26.958
entangle herb,

45:27.041 --> 45:28.416
or Ellie Houseman.

45:28.958 --> 45:30.291
[Enola] "The bankmen met."

45:30.750 --> 45:33.458
-My mother is rather a fan of word games.
-[echo] Word games.

45:33.541 --> 45:36.166
She made me read every book
in Ferndell's library.

45:36.250 --> 45:37.083
[echo] Every book.

45:37.166 --> 45:38.083
"Bankmen met."

45:38.583 --> 45:40.875
Bankmen... met.

45:41.333 --> 45:43.458
[Eudoria] ...the bankmen met...

45:43.541 --> 45:44.708
[Enola] The Embankment!

45:45.041 --> 45:47.291
[Eudoria] We need to make a decision.
Entangle herb.

45:49.250 --> 45:50.791
[Enola] "Entangle herb."

45:50.875 --> 45:52.208
[Eudoria] ...entangle herb...

45:52.291 --> 45:53.416
[Enola] Bethnal Green.

45:54.875 --> 45:56.083
[Eudoria] So, we're all agreed?

45:56.166 --> 45:57.375
[echo] We're all agreed?

45:57.458 --> 45:59.333
-[Enola] Ellie Houseman...
-[Eudoria] Agreed?

45:59.416 --> 46:00.791
Ellie Houseman.

46:00.875 --> 46:03.333
-[Enola] Ellie Houseman.
-[Eudoria] Ellie Houseman.

46:03.416 --> 46:05.333
[Enola] Ellie House...man.

46:06.208 --> 46:07.166
House.

46:07.583 --> 46:08.791
[overlapping voices]

46:15.750 --> 46:17.458
[Enola] Limehouse Lane.

46:17.541 --> 46:19.791
-Ellie Houseman.
-[Eudoria] So, we're all agreed?

46:19.875 --> 46:21.541
[overlapping voices]

46:21.625 --> 46:23.166
[Enola] Limehouse Lane.

46:47.250 --> 46:49.625
[bottles rattling]

46:51.541 --> 46:53.541
[girl] Are we going home now?

46:54.375 --> 46:55.250
[woman] Yes.

46:55.833 --> 46:57.500
[girl] I'm hungry, Mother.

46:58.083 --> 46:59.291
[woman] I know, dear.

47:05.958 --> 47:06.916
[floor creaking]

47:29.666 --> 47:30.500

47:44.875 --> 47:48.250
Try to be excited, not disappointed,

47:48.875 --> 47:50.958
at the possibilities of something new.

47:55.458 --> 47:56.375
[Enola screams]

47:57.250 --> 47:58.666
[Eudoria laughs]

48:00.000 --> 48:01.375

48:01.916 --> 48:02.833
[chuckles]

48:19.333 --> 48:20.625
[suspenseful music plays]

48:44.500 --> 48:45.875
[softly] Mycroft was right.

48:47.375 --> 48:48.750
You are dangerous.

48:56.166 --> 48:57.791
And Sherlock was right too.

49:00.250 --> 49:01.833
You do have a plan.

49:01.916 --> 49:03.333
[dramatic music plays]

49:06.166 --> 49:07.666
What are you planning, Mother?

49:10.458 --> 49:11.916
Do I want to find you?

49:14.333 --> 49:15.250
Let's do it again.

49:33.791 --> 49:34.958
[Enola screams]

49:37.125 --> 49:37.958
[muffled screaming]

[muffled screaming]

49:42.750 --> 49:43.708
[gasping breaths]

49:43.791 --> 49:47.083
I will ask you this only once.
Where is the marquess?

49:47.166 --> 49:48.500
[panting]

49:48.583 --> 49:49.625
Now, who would that be?

49:49.708 --> 49:50.666
[grunts]

49:53.416 --> 49:54.500
[gasping breaths]

49:54.583 --> 49:55.791
We went our separate ways.

49:58.458 --> 49:59.666
[Linthorn grunts]

50:00.208 --> 50:02.291
[gasping breaths] I've not seen him.

50:02.375 --> 50:04.250
I have nothing to do with him.

50:04.333 --> 50:05.750
That's a shame.

50:05.833 --> 50:07.166
[Enola breathing heavily]

50:07.250 --> 50:08.708
Well, you've seen my face now.

50:08.791 --> 50:11.250
[pants] No, your face
is totally unmemorable!

50:11.666 --> 50:13.375

50:51.000 --> 50:52.875
[breathing heavily]

50:55.875 --> 50:57.000
I'm not sure I ever described

50:57.083 --> 50:59.375
how a typical day's education worked
with my mother.

50:59.458 --> 51:00.541
[Eudoria] Hmm.

51:00.625 --> 51:02.333
We'd start with history.
She always said...

51:02.416 --> 51:05.333
[Eudoria] Historical perspective
is the only way to begin a day.

51:06.666 --> 51:07.833
[Enola] Then we'd lunch,

51:08.583 --> 51:09.791
and I'd work on my physics.

51:10.250 --> 51:12.291
Then after lunch, I'd focus on fitness...

51:12.375 --> 51:13.208
[Eudoria] Got you!

51:13.291 --> 51:14.750
...followed by fight combat.

53:16.916 --> 53:18.041
[shuddering breaths]

53:23.375 --> 53:25.625
[chuckles] I knew this would have
a truer use.

53:27.583 --> 53:29.416
No more surprises.

53:30.166 --> 53:31.041
No.

53:33.250 --> 53:34.083
No.

53:37.625 --> 53:38.958
[Linthorn yelps]

53:39.041 --> 53:40.708
[Linthorn yelling]

53:52.750 --> 53:54.000
[bird squawking]

54:08.791 --> 54:10.541
When I was a child, I cut my knee open

54:10.625 --> 54:12.458
trying to save a sheep
from the cliff edge.

54:13.000 --> 54:14.458
[sheep bleating]

54:14.875 --> 54:16.666
[chuckles] I almost died, in truth.

54:19.916 --> 54:21.041
Mother was angry.

54:21.125 --> 54:22.250
[inaudible]

54:23.791 --> 54:25.166
[inaudible]

54:27.416 --> 54:28.500
Very angry.

54:29.541 --> 54:31.583
[Eudoria] It is good
to care for the vulnerable,

54:32.000 --> 54:34.166
but not if it means risking your life.

54:35.666 --> 54:37.500
Sometimes you have to let nature...

54:38.250 --> 54:39.208
take its course.

54:39.875 --> 54:41.250
-Do you hear me?
-[inhales sharply]

54:42.833 --> 54:43.833
[Enola] The truth is,

54:44.250 --> 54:47.625
I did not ask for Viscount Tewkesbury,
Marquess of Basilwether in my life.

54:48.666 --> 54:52.375
I did not want the Viscount Tewkesbury,
Marquess of Basilwether in my life.

54:53.750 --> 54:55.333
So why do I feel responsibility

54:55.666 --> 54:58.291
for the Viscount Tewkesbury,
Marquess of Basilwether?

54:59.541 --> 55:00.375
Because...

55:01.500 --> 55:03.375
there are those that want to hurt him...

55:04.666 --> 55:06.375
and he has not the strength
to stop them...

55:06.458 --> 55:09.458
-[yells]
-...and I do have that strength.

55:11.291 --> 55:12.416
She would have me leave him.

55:13.500 --> 55:14.541
He is foolish,

55:15.000 --> 55:17.541
and proud, and utterly ridiculous.

55:21.208 --> 55:22.666
But he's on the edge of a cliff.

55:24.375 --> 55:26.583
Mother, you will have to wait.

55:31.666 --> 55:34.041
[horse whinnying]

55:34.583 --> 55:36.125
[galloping]

56:01.333 --> 56:03.458
When looking to travel incognito,

56:03.791 --> 56:05.583
it's safest to travel as a widow.

56:06.500 --> 56:09.583
People are always anxious
to avoid conversations about death.

56:09.666 --> 56:10.500
[horse whinnies]

56:10.583 --> 56:11.625
Widows scare them,

56:12.458 --> 56:14.958
and there's no better disguise than fear.

56:15.583 --> 56:17.375
-[sniffling]
-[bird cawing]

56:19.083 --> 56:19.958
[cries]

56:24.708 --> 56:27.250
Miss May Beatrice Posy.

56:32.083 --> 56:33.083
'Tis I.

56:33.166 --> 56:37.041
For the Lady Tewkesbury,
Marchioness of Basilwether.

56:39.000 --> 56:39.833
[Enola sighs]

56:46.000 --> 56:46.916
[doors close]

56:58.458 --> 57:01.625
-[Sir Whimbrel] What's your business here?
-[Enola] I'm a private detective.

57:01.708 --> 57:02.958
I've come to offer my services.

57:03.041 --> 57:05.916
My sister-in-law
has all the help she needs. Show her out.

57:07.750 --> 57:08.750
I believe I can help you.

57:08.833 --> 57:11.541
You are a reporter
for one of those dirty newspapers.

57:11.625 --> 57:13.125
I am a lady detective.

57:14.375 --> 57:15.291
Please leave,

57:16.083 --> 57:17.458
before we make you leave.

57:18.875 --> 57:20.250
I work for Sherlock Holmes.

57:25.458 --> 57:26.291
I...

57:26.791 --> 57:28.000
I'm his assistant.

57:31.000 --> 57:33.375
He sends me ahead of time
to prepare the ground.

57:35.375 --> 57:37.291
Sherlock Holmes is interested
in our case?

57:39.291 --> 57:41.166
-Yes.
-[Lady Tewkesbury] And he...

57:41.666 --> 57:45.125
[breathes deeply]
sent along a widow to fleece his path?

57:46.458 --> 57:47.875
A very good issue to take.

57:49.375 --> 57:50.958
May have overthought my outfit.

57:52.000 --> 57:52.875
[clears throat]

57:52.958 --> 57:55.833
Widowhood doesn't impact on my ability
to do my job.

57:55.916 --> 57:58.291
-Sherlock trusts me to--
-[Lestrade] Poppycock!

57:58.375 --> 58:00.250
I'm sorry, but I've heard enough.

58:00.333 --> 58:02.416
You do not know Sherlock Holmes.

58:02.500 --> 58:06.083
Oh, Lestrade. So pleased you could make
this young lady's acquaintance.

58:06.166 --> 58:08.083
I am Lestrade of Scotland Yard,

58:08.166 --> 58:10.666
and I'm a close personal friend
of Sherlock Holmes.

58:10.750 --> 58:11.750
So you claim.

58:12.833 --> 58:16.416
-He's never mentioned him.
-And you are not his assistant.

58:16.500 --> 58:18.166
He doesn't have an assistant.

58:18.250 --> 58:20.625
Sherlock Holmes always works alone.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.208
He's changed his ways
since you claim to have known him.

58:24.291 --> 58:26.958
-Impossible.
-Ask me three questions about him,

58:27.041 --> 58:30.166
and I'll ask you three, and we'll discover
who knows him best. Shall we?

58:31.541 --> 58:34.291
Enough! This circus is not appropriate
for Basilwether.

58:34.375 --> 58:36.750
-She's right. Leave, both of you.
-[shuddering breaths]

58:36.833 --> 58:37.791
But, madam, you know me.

58:37.875 --> 58:39.666
I am Lestrade, I am from Scotland Yard,

58:39.750 --> 58:42.291
and I'm investigating
your son's disappearance.

58:42.375 --> 58:45.041
-He has proven useful.
-Mama!

58:45.125 --> 58:48.666
I don't care if you're from the Houses of
Parliament. Leave this house this instant.

58:49.333 --> 58:50.708
[clock ticking]

58:59.000 --> 58:59.916
Me too.

59:00.000 --> 59:01.083
[door opens]

59:07.833 --> 59:09.208
[Enola] Thank you for having me.

59:11.166 --> 59:12.458
[birds chirping]

59:14.750 --> 59:16.208
His favorite tobacco?

59:16.291 --> 59:17.166
Black shag.

59:17.666 --> 59:19.291
-Favorite dessert?
-Plum pie.

59:20.041 --> 59:21.208
His favorite composer?

59:21.875 --> 59:22.791
Paganini.

59:23.541 --> 59:24.833
Favorite meal of the day?

59:25.666 --> 59:26.625
Breakfast.

59:27.791 --> 59:30.208
Are all your questions about food?

59:31.958 --> 59:33.375
His favorite case?

59:34.125 --> 59:35.125
The one before.

59:36.291 --> 59:37.416
Favorite board game?

59:41.416 --> 59:43.083
How do you know Sherlock Holmes?

59:43.166 --> 59:44.125
Chess.

59:45.666 --> 59:47.416
But only with a worthy opponent.

59:47.875 --> 59:48.750
[Lestrade] Hmm.

1:00:05.541 --> 1:00:06.375
[chuckles]

1:00:06.458 --> 1:00:08.250
[Enola panting]

1:00:09.166 --> 1:00:10.000
I say!

1:00:11.708 --> 1:00:13.083
I'll pay you five pounds...

1:00:13.708 --> 1:00:14.875
to swap clothes with me.

1:00:16.583 --> 1:00:18.916
You needn't wear my dress
if you prefer not to.

1:00:21.583 --> 1:00:22.500
The young master,

1:00:23.041 --> 1:00:24.916
he was outside a lot. Am I right?

1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:26.625
Could never get him inside.

1:00:28.083 --> 1:00:29.416
[Enola] Where would he go?

1:00:30.875 --> 1:00:31.875
The woods.

1:00:34.333 --> 1:00:35.208
[chuckles]

1:00:35.291 --> 1:00:36.375
[man] Hey! Hey!

1:00:36.458 --> 1:00:37.875
[people chattering]

1:00:39.958 --> 1:00:41.125
[entrance bell jingles]

1:00:41.500 --> 1:00:44.333
Grab a book and have a seat,
and I'll be with you as soon as I'm free.

1:00:44.416 --> 1:00:46.875
Delightful.
Perhaps you could join me for tea.

1:00:48.875 --> 1:00:50.875
I advise you not to... walk away.

1:00:53.333 --> 1:00:55.666
And yet you walk away anyway.

1:00:55.750 --> 1:00:57.916
Whatever you think you know,
Sherlock Holmes,

1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:00.750
please be advised that if you disturb
any of my customers--

1:01:00.833 --> 1:01:02.000
You'd hurt me badly?

1:01:02.083 --> 1:01:04.458
I am well aware of your talents,
Miss Grayston.

1:01:04.541 --> 1:01:06.166
The question is, what you'd risk

1:01:06.250 --> 1:01:08.125
if I were to advise my friends
in the government

1:01:08.208 --> 1:01:09.750
to take a look at this place.

1:01:09.833 --> 1:01:11.500
I know my brother would be delighted

1:01:11.583 --> 1:01:15.625
to browse your seditious, dangerous,
and extremely banned bookshelves.

1:01:16.083 --> 1:01:17.000
[scoffs]

1:01:17.958 --> 1:01:18.916
[Sherlock] You see?

1:01:19.458 --> 1:01:21.041
We can both hurt each other.

1:01:23.166 --> 1:01:26.291
Now, please put the teapot down.
In your hands, it is a mighty weapon.

1:01:27.875 --> 1:01:28.708
[scoffs]

1:01:28.791 --> 1:01:29.791
[Sherlock] Thank you.

1:01:29.875 --> 1:01:32.208
Do you have any sense
as to where my mother is?

1:01:32.625 --> 1:01:33.708
How did you find me?

1:01:33.791 --> 1:01:35.500
Letters hidden up her chimney.

1:01:36.208 --> 1:01:39.000
The ash on the sole of her shoe
and the coal dust led me to them.

1:01:41.625 --> 1:01:44.416
She always said you never missed anything.

1:01:44.500 --> 1:01:47.625
She needs to be home.
She has a daughter that needs her.

1:01:47.708 --> 1:01:51.250
Enola seems to be surviving perfectly well
on her own.

1:01:51.333 --> 1:01:52.541
So you've seen her?

1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:57.041
-Is she safe?
-She's had company,

1:01:57.125 --> 1:01:58.250
a useless boy.

1:01:59.333 --> 1:02:01.708
But clearly,
she didn't feel like she needed him.

1:02:02.625 --> 1:02:04.375
Enola is on her own path,

1:02:04.458 --> 1:02:07.708
and so, for better or worse, is Eudoria.

1:02:08.250 --> 1:02:10.500
-Whatever mischief you two are--
-Mischief?!

1:02:11.208 --> 1:02:13.125
A poor choice of word.

1:02:14.041 --> 1:02:15.791
Try not to sound like your brother.

1:02:17.625 --> 1:02:21.375
You haven't any hope of understanding
any of this. You do know that?

1:02:21.458 --> 1:02:22.833
Educate me as to why.

1:02:23.916 --> 1:02:26.875
Because you don't know
what it is to be without power.

1:02:28.291 --> 1:02:29.791
Politics doesn't interest you.

1:02:29.875 --> 1:02:31.291
-Why?
-Because it's fatally boring.

1:02:31.375 --> 1:02:34.166
Because you have no interest
in changing a world

1:02:34.708 --> 1:02:36.958
that suits you so well.

1:02:38.083 --> 1:02:40.125
-A pretty speech.
-[Edith] A scary one.

1:02:40.625 --> 1:02:43.625
You're intelligent enough to know
that every word of it is true.

1:02:44.333 --> 1:02:46.250
[Edith chuckles]

1:02:46.333 --> 1:02:47.500
What a family!

1:02:48.708 --> 1:02:51.000
A lost child, a puffed-up misanthrope,

1:02:51.083 --> 1:02:53.833
a revolutionary, and yourself.

1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:57.250
No wife, no friends,

1:02:57.333 --> 1:02:59.083
just a strange occupation

1:02:59.166 --> 1:03:01.958
obsessed with footprints and coal dust.

1:03:02.666 --> 1:03:04.416
You see the world so closely,

1:03:04.500 --> 1:03:06.750
but do you see how it's changing?

1:03:06.833 --> 1:03:07.833
[breathes deeply]

1:03:07.916 --> 1:03:10.416
The reform bill is just the beginning.

1:03:11.041 --> 1:03:11.958
If it passes.

1:03:14.791 --> 1:03:16.958
I have to get back to work now,
Mr. Holmes.

1:03:17.708 --> 1:03:18.916
Customers to serve.

1:03:19.666 --> 1:03:20.750
Cakes to bake.

1:03:22.791 --> 1:03:23.708
[Edith sighs]

1:03:24.166 --> 1:03:26.208
I'm pleased you're interested, at least.

1:03:26.291 --> 1:03:28.750
Eudoria thought
that you'd just ignore your sister,

1:03:28.833 --> 1:03:30.875
like the ostrich you are.

1:03:33.916 --> 1:03:35.583
But I suspect that she needs you.

1:03:40.833 --> 1:03:42.416
So everyone keeps telling me.

1:03:42.500 --> 1:03:43.958
-[door closes]
-[bell jingles]

1:03:52.125 --> 1:03:53.791
[sighs]

1:03:53.875 --> 1:03:55.875
A simple shave, please, Martin.

1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:03.916
Her name?

1:04:04.500 --> 1:04:06.291
May Beatrice Posy.

1:04:08.666 --> 1:04:09.750
[Mycroft] She looked?

1:04:10.333 --> 1:04:12.291
Small, dark, young.

1:04:12.375 --> 1:04:14.458
-How young?
-[Lestrade] Barely past 20.

1:04:15.583 --> 1:04:16.416
[Mycroft] Hmm.

1:04:17.375 --> 1:04:19.708
-[Mycroft] Her mind?
-[Lestrade] Sharp as a tack.

1:04:19.791 --> 1:04:21.083
And what she knew of Sherlock...

1:04:21.166 --> 1:04:22.583
Oh, she knew a great deal?

1:04:23.708 --> 1:04:24.750
As much as I.

1:04:25.291 --> 1:04:26.708
Oh, another sycophant.

1:04:26.791 --> 1:04:28.416
How very exciting.

1:04:29.541 --> 1:04:31.125
Will you tell me who she is?

1:04:31.208 --> 1:04:34.000
Do you have any sense
of where she might have gone?

1:04:34.083 --> 1:04:36.541
[Lestrade] Oh, you wish to track her down.

1:04:36.875 --> 1:04:40.291
I've been engaged in trying to do so
for a number of days.

1:04:40.375 --> 1:04:42.041
[Lestrade chuckling] Of course!

1:04:42.875 --> 1:04:44.125
She's your sister.

1:04:44.208 --> 1:04:46.041
Keep your mouth shut!

1:04:47.208 --> 1:04:48.916
[Mycroft sighs]

1:04:49.666 --> 1:04:50.666
Yes.

1:04:51.166 --> 1:04:54.125
And I believe I explicitly told you
to look for her.

1:04:54.208 --> 1:04:57.833
W-- You explicitly told me
to look for a scrappy girl with no poise.

1:04:57.916 --> 1:05:00.583
This was a woman with extreme poise.

1:05:00.666 --> 1:05:02.916
[Mycroft] Oh, there's a wild thing
underneath,

1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:04.250
that I assure you.

1:05:08.291 --> 1:05:09.208
Find her,

1:05:10.333 --> 1:05:11.875
and you will be well rewarded.

1:05:19.500 --> 1:05:20.333
[Mycroft sighs]

1:05:20.416 --> 1:05:22.958
-[door opens, closes]
-[bell jingles]

1:05:23.625 --> 1:05:24.541
[chuckles]

1:05:25.291 --> 1:05:26.416
[birds chirping]

1:05:32.166 --> 1:05:35.375
A tree branch broke above me
as I was collecting wild mushrooms.

1:05:40.750 --> 1:05:42.083
It should have crushed me.

1:05:57.000 --> 1:05:58.916
[wind chime tinkling]

1:06:01.750 --> 1:06:02.833
[Enola] Tewkesbury?

1:06:07.666 --> 1:06:08.541
[grunts]

1:06:09.500 --> 1:06:10.333
[grunts]

1:06:10.416 --> 1:06:12.666
[grunting]

1:06:14.791 --> 1:06:15.625
[grunts]

1:06:16.375 --> 1:06:18.250
[owl hooting]

1:06:19.541 --> 1:06:21.375
[breathing heavily]

1:06:21.458 --> 1:06:23.250
[bird squawking]

1:06:37.875 --> 1:06:40.333
[breathing heavily]

1:07:10.375 --> 1:07:12.708
[train whistling and chugging]

1:07:15.791 --> 1:07:18.000
[Enola] So this is where
you laid your plans.

1:07:22.041 --> 1:07:24.541
Or maybe that's what
you wanted them to think.

1:07:27.166 --> 1:07:28.625
You were leading them astray.

1:07:32.208 --> 1:07:34.208
This must be why Bowler Hat was there...

1:07:34.625 --> 1:07:37.208
-[screams]
-...following your breadcrumb trail.

1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:41.666
So what was your real plan?

1:07:46.125 --> 1:07:47.041
[chuckles]

1:07:48.833 --> 1:07:51.791
Oh, you tickle me, Viscount Tewkesbury,

1:07:52.500 --> 1:07:56.916
you magnificent
Marquess of blooming Basilwether.

1:07:58.291 --> 1:08:02.083
And you're a cleverer boy
than I perhaps gave you credit for.

1:08:02.166 --> 1:08:04.875
-[woman] It's not as stable as you think.
-[gasps]

1:08:07.083 --> 1:08:10.500
Some of those branches
are extremely capricious.

1:08:14.583 --> 1:08:15.541
Good morning.

1:08:16.458 --> 1:08:18.166
I believe we've already met,

1:08:18.250 --> 1:08:20.541
though you were dressed differently then.

1:08:21.208 --> 1:08:23.333
You'd already discovered this, hadn't you?

1:08:23.750 --> 1:08:25.541
[woman] We found it a few days ago.

1:08:26.625 --> 1:08:28.000
Would you care to come down?

1:08:30.541 --> 1:08:32.958
Did you see anything to report

1:08:33.041 --> 1:08:34.958
-to your... "employer"?
-[grunts]

1:08:37.458 --> 1:08:38.291
Oh.

1:08:39.291 --> 1:08:40.125
No.

1:08:41.833 --> 1:08:43.291
Sherlock. Um...

1:08:43.875 --> 1:08:45.708
He'll probably want to come by.

1:08:47.166 --> 1:08:49.583
-What did you say your name was?
-May.

1:08:53.875 --> 1:08:55.125
May Beatrice Posy.

1:08:55.875 --> 1:08:58.041
And how old are you, Miss Posy?

1:08:59.208 --> 1:09:00.208
Twenty-two.

1:09:02.750 --> 1:09:06.208
I'll have to let the gardener go
for lending you his uniform.

1:09:06.583 --> 1:09:07.416
No.

1:09:08.041 --> 1:09:08.916
No, I forced him.

1:09:10.291 --> 1:09:11.166
Tied him up.

1:09:12.333 --> 1:09:13.375
I know jujutsu.

1:09:15.208 --> 1:09:16.083
[grunts]

1:09:18.875 --> 1:09:20.000
It's a martial art.

1:09:21.041 --> 1:09:23.083
You are most intriguing, Miss Posy.

1:09:23.166 --> 1:09:24.333
[chuckles]

1:09:24.833 --> 1:09:26.500
Or should I say "missus"?

1:09:27.291 --> 1:09:29.291
My condolences, by the way.

1:09:30.500 --> 1:09:31.833
[birds chirping]

1:09:33.375 --> 1:09:34.583
Beautiful, isn't it?

1:09:35.416 --> 1:09:36.875
It always felt an honor to me

1:09:36.958 --> 1:09:40.500
that my family was given
this part of England to protect.

1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:42.208
To protect?

1:09:42.666 --> 1:09:45.583
That is what it is
to be an ancestral landowner.

1:09:46.291 --> 1:09:49.625
As the world becomes
increasingly unstable,

1:09:49.708 --> 1:09:54.458
it feels important
that these ideas of England are preserved

1:09:55.500 --> 1:09:59.125
for the safety and security
of the future of our country.

1:10:02.375 --> 1:10:03.541
It is lovely here.

1:10:05.041 --> 1:10:07.583
But you're probably
one of those new thinkers.

1:10:09.166 --> 1:10:11.375
My son was a new thinker too.

1:10:11.458 --> 1:10:13.125
Never could focus on what was,

1:10:13.208 --> 1:10:15.208
it was always about what could be.

1:10:15.916 --> 1:10:18.291
I suspect my grandson is the same.

1:10:20.500 --> 1:10:22.541
England's true glory...

1:10:23.333 --> 1:10:24.625
is what is.

1:10:26.083 --> 1:10:27.000
Do you see?

1:10:32.833 --> 1:10:34.333
I can see much beauty.

1:10:35.166 --> 1:10:36.875
Very sensible answer.

1:10:38.541 --> 1:10:39.375
Now go.

1:10:39.458 --> 1:10:42.958
If my son or daughter-in-law
finds you here, they'll have you arrested.

1:10:45.375 --> 1:10:48.458
If you see my grandson before I do,

1:10:49.750 --> 1:10:52.583
will you tell him
that I care about him a great deal?

1:10:55.666 --> 1:10:56.500
I will.

1:10:58.000 --> 1:10:58.875
Off you go.

1:11:02.958 --> 1:11:04.708
-[horse neighs]
-[people chattering]

1:11:20.958 --> 1:11:22.333
I want four yellow flowers,

1:11:22.416 --> 1:11:23.625
two blue, and a red one.

1:11:23.958 --> 1:11:26.083
I don't care about the breed.
Any flower will do.

1:11:27.041 --> 1:11:28.208
What are you doing here?

1:11:28.666 --> 1:11:31.666
Why, if you're passionate about flowers,
would you come to London?

1:11:31.750 --> 1:11:34.208
-Because I can be lost here.
-And yet I found you.

1:11:35.500 --> 1:11:36.500
And why have you done so?

1:11:39.541 --> 1:11:41.916
You're here for the money.
They've offered a reward.

1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:42.875
Have they?

1:11:43.541 --> 1:11:44.750
I didn't know.

1:11:46.833 --> 1:11:48.375
Well, I must tie you up and claim it!

1:11:48.833 --> 1:11:50.333
[Enola laughing]

1:11:50.416 --> 1:11:52.833
Stars and garters,
are you really so ridiculous?

1:11:55.041 --> 1:11:58.375
I've come here because I've grown
to like you more in your absence,

1:11:58.458 --> 1:12:01.375
and because, as it turns out,
your life is still in danger.

1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:03.458
What's made you like me more?

1:12:04.500 --> 1:12:08.875
Really? That is your question?
Not "Who is trying to kill me?"

1:12:14.375 --> 1:12:17.291
I found your flower pressings.
They were quite beautiful.

1:12:17.375 --> 1:12:19.250
I don't give a fig about flowers,
of course.

1:12:19.333 --> 1:12:22.041
-That's because you're ignorant.
-Ignorant? How dare you?

1:12:22.125 --> 1:12:23.833
Ignorant and willfully so.

1:12:23.916 --> 1:12:26.250
-You could change your mind about a boy.
-I'm not a boy.

1:12:26.333 --> 1:12:27.666
[inhales deeply] I'm a man.

1:12:27.750 --> 1:12:29.875
You're a man when I tell you you're a man.

1:12:30.791 --> 1:12:32.958
You do look better in breeches,
I'll give you that.

1:12:34.583 --> 1:12:36.083
I've missed you, Enola Holmes.

1:12:36.541 --> 1:12:37.750
I wanted to miss you,

1:12:38.500 --> 1:12:40.500
but I kept getting dragged back
towards you.

1:12:40.583 --> 1:12:43.750
Now, come on. We're in serious danger,
if you didn't know.

1:12:54.875 --> 1:12:58.250
-Is this how you're living?
-Did you just rent a room at the Ritz?

1:12:58.916 --> 1:13:01.833
I afforded myself
a shade more comfort than this.

1:13:02.583 --> 1:13:05.083
Well, the woman I boarded off
assured me this was a fine room.

1:13:05.166 --> 1:13:06.041
[Tewkesbury] Mmm.

1:13:07.041 --> 1:13:08.750
The woman you boarded off lied.

1:13:13.833 --> 1:13:16.916
I have but a single bed,
so you'll have to sleep on the floor.

1:13:20.791 --> 1:13:22.000
You keep old newspapers?

1:13:22.083 --> 1:13:25.041
Be careful with that.
I haven't finished reading it yet.

1:13:25.541 --> 1:13:26.958
Oh. I'm in this one.

1:13:27.583 --> 1:13:28.708
-So you are.
-Look.

1:13:34.375 --> 1:13:37.083
Why do you keep all these old newspapers,
Enola Holmes?

1:13:40.750 --> 1:13:41.583
My mother.

1:13:42.916 --> 1:13:45.500
I'm waiting for her to leave me a message.

1:13:46.583 --> 1:13:48.625
-She hasn't yet.
-"Message"? What...

1:13:49.041 --> 1:13:50.375
[Enola] She likes ciphers.

1:13:51.833 --> 1:13:54.166
Coded messages that need to be deciphered.

1:13:55.250 --> 1:13:57.500
And why would she leave you a message?

1:14:00.833 --> 1:14:01.958
Because she left me.

1:14:05.250 --> 1:14:06.875
And I thought she meant
for me to find her,

1:14:06.958 --> 1:14:08.416
but I'm not sure she did now.

1:14:09.625 --> 1:14:12.250
So I left her a message,
and I'm hopeful of a reply.

1:14:13.791 --> 1:14:15.500
I keep the newspapers to check.

1:14:18.208 --> 1:14:19.041
[both grunt]

1:14:19.125 --> 1:14:20.041
[Enola] I got it.

1:14:20.458 --> 1:14:21.541
[Enola chuckles]

1:14:23.500 --> 1:14:24.375
[Tewkesbury chuckles]

1:14:25.125 --> 1:14:26.541
Don't look at me like that.

1:14:27.583 --> 1:14:28.541
I'm sorry.

1:14:29.375 --> 1:14:30.958
I don't want your pity, Tewkesbury.

1:14:35.583 --> 1:14:37.458
If you don't stop looking at me like that,

1:14:37.541 --> 1:14:40.666
Viscount Irritation,
Marquess of Bothersomeshire,

1:14:40.750 --> 1:14:42.291
I'll murder you myself.

1:14:44.500 --> 1:14:46.708
People don't seem to want us, do they?

1:14:49.916 --> 1:14:50.750
No.

1:14:52.291 --> 1:14:54.958
Still, at least we've got each other.

1:15:02.458 --> 1:15:03.583
I'll make us some tea.

1:15:04.541 --> 1:15:05.375
[both chuckle]

1:15:07.708 --> 1:15:10.166
So you genuinely believe
my life's in danger?

1:15:11.458 --> 1:15:12.666
Uh, from whom?

1:15:12.750 --> 1:15:15.333
-Your past and your future.
-Whatever does that mean?

1:15:15.416 --> 1:15:17.791
[Enola] Your family. They didn't send
a detective to find you.

1:15:17.875 --> 1:15:21.041
They could have, and they didn't.
Instead, they sent a murderer.

1:15:21.958 --> 1:15:23.625
[Tewkesbury] Why would anyone
want me dead?

1:15:23.708 --> 1:15:25.041
Countless reasons.

1:15:26.333 --> 1:15:29.625
Your personality, your ridiculous hair,
your silly smile,

1:15:29.708 --> 1:15:32.791
or possibly your land, your estate,
your title, your seat.

1:15:32.875 --> 1:15:34.791
Same reasons they wanted your father dead.

1:15:34.875 --> 1:15:36.875
Greed does funny things to people,
Tewkesbury.

1:15:36.958 --> 1:15:39.500
So now you're saying
you think they killed my father?

1:15:39.583 --> 1:15:40.708
I don't think.

1:15:42.333 --> 1:15:43.291
I know.

1:15:43.375 --> 1:15:45.666
No. No, none of this
makes the slightest sense.

1:15:45.750 --> 1:15:48.083
My father's death was caused
by a botched burglary,

1:15:48.166 --> 1:15:50.750
and-- and it would have been easier
to kill me before I ran away,

1:15:50.833 --> 1:15:53.166
-rather than now--
-I entirely agree. I think they tried to.

1:15:53.250 --> 1:15:55.125
I found the branch that almost killed you.

1:15:55.208 --> 1:15:57.000
-It had been cut.
-Cut?

1:15:57.083 --> 1:15:58.583
-[Lestrade] Better you--
-[Enola yells]

1:15:58.666 --> 1:16:00.541
[Lestrade grunts] Oh, gosh! Oh!

1:16:01.541 --> 1:16:02.916
-Oh, gosh, you...
-[Enola] Come on!

1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:05.208
-[Lestrade grunts] Come back here!
-Who's he?

1:16:06.250 --> 1:16:08.500
-Didn't you get her, Inspector?
-Shut up, you!

1:16:09.166 --> 1:16:10.666
[Enola] Move the chest! Move the chest!

1:16:10.750 --> 1:16:12.250
[grunts] Where are they?

1:16:13.541 --> 1:16:15.333
Open up, Miss Posy,

1:16:15.416 --> 1:16:18.125
-or should I say Miss Holmes?
-[Enola and Tewkesbury grunting]

1:16:18.208 --> 1:16:21.333
Inspector Lestrade,
I need to report an attempted murder.

1:16:21.416 --> 1:16:22.958
You're supposed to be on our side.

1:16:23.583 --> 1:16:25.083
[grunting]

1:16:25.166 --> 1:16:26.916
Help me get in through this door.

1:16:27.333 --> 1:16:29.791
Well, I'll help you when I get my money,
my finder's fee.

1:16:29.875 --> 1:16:32.375
You'll get your money when we catch her.
Come on!

1:16:32.916 --> 1:16:34.458
[Enola] See that window over there?

1:16:35.416 --> 1:16:36.833
It leads onto a roof.

1:16:36.916 --> 1:16:39.500
I need you to climb out
and take off into nowhere.

1:16:39.583 --> 1:16:40.416
And leave you?

1:16:40.500 --> 1:16:41.875
I need to hold this door!

1:16:41.958 --> 1:16:43.833
-But you need to get away too!
-[Lestrade grunts]

1:16:43.916 --> 1:16:45.791
If he catches you,
your life will be in danger.

1:16:45.875 --> 1:16:49.541
If he catches me,
it's simply a life I do not want. Now go.

1:16:50.416 --> 1:16:52.083
I don't want to leave you, Enola.

1:16:52.166 --> 1:16:53.541
[banging on door]

1:16:53.625 --> 1:16:54.666
[Lestrade grunts]

1:16:54.750 --> 1:16:55.916
Go!

1:16:56.250 --> 1:16:57.166
Go!

1:16:59.791 --> 1:17:01.500
[Lestrade grunting]

1:17:03.625 --> 1:17:04.750
[Lestrade and Enola grunting]

1:17:11.541 --> 1:17:12.458
[Lestrade grunts]

1:17:13.041 --> 1:17:14.083
[grunts]

1:17:14.166 --> 1:17:15.708
Help me now!

1:17:16.125 --> 1:17:17.208
Useless men!

1:17:18.375 --> 1:17:19.458
[Lestrade grunts]

1:17:19.875 --> 1:17:21.041
[both yelling]

1:17:21.791 --> 1:17:23.375
No!

1:17:23.458 --> 1:17:25.000
[all grunting]

1:17:25.083 --> 1:17:27.625
[all breathing heavily]

1:17:27.708 --> 1:17:29.000
He's worth more,

1:17:29.583 --> 1:17:31.333
but you give me greater pleasure.

1:17:33.541 --> 1:17:34.625
[chuckles]

1:17:36.833 --> 1:17:37.875
[thunder rumbles]

1:17:37.958 --> 1:17:39.166
[rain pattering]

1:17:46.125 --> 1:17:47.625
[Mycroft] You may not like me.

1:17:48.708 --> 1:17:50.833
You may not think what I'm doing is right.

1:17:51.250 --> 1:17:53.750
But even your blessed mother made a match.

1:17:54.541 --> 1:17:56.416
Even your blessed mother was a bride.

1:17:59.458 --> 1:18:00.916
I want you to be happy.

1:18:01.000 --> 1:18:01.833
[crying] No.

1:18:04.375 --> 1:18:06.083
You want you to be happy.

1:18:06.791 --> 1:18:08.125
You want me controlled.

1:18:08.541 --> 1:18:11.208
Because otherwise you think
I will affect your standing.

1:18:11.291 --> 1:18:13.333
You already have done immense damage.

1:18:14.666 --> 1:18:16.833
As has that errant brother of ours.

1:18:18.416 --> 1:18:20.333
Let me out of this carriage.

1:18:21.583 --> 1:18:24.375
I will deny I am your sister
to whoever asks,

1:18:24.458 --> 1:18:26.625
and I will do it with pleasure.

1:18:26.708 --> 1:18:29.083
[yelling] You are my ward!

1:18:29.166 --> 1:18:31.291
And you will do as you are told!

1:18:37.625 --> 1:18:38.458
[sobs]

1:18:40.750 --> 1:18:41.666
[sobbing]

1:18:42.541 --> 1:18:43.958
[Mycroft] Now, hand it over.

1:18:45.083 --> 1:18:46.541
It is my money, after all.

1:18:49.416 --> 1:18:50.625
[breathing deeply]

1:18:55.375 --> 1:18:56.708
-Good girl.
-[sobbing]

1:18:57.583 --> 1:18:59.291
[horses neighing]

1:19:05.750 --> 1:19:07.000
[clock ticking]

1:19:08.041 --> 1:19:11.625
You've missed supper, but no matter.
You could do with losing a pound or two.

1:19:16.416 --> 1:19:18.791
The name Holmes

1:19:18.875 --> 1:19:21.125
is coming to mean something
in this country.

1:19:21.208 --> 1:19:23.708
At this school,
you'll be given a chance to live up to it.

1:19:23.791 --> 1:19:26.250
-But I--
-And you can begin by closing your mouth.

1:19:26.958 --> 1:19:30.875
The next time you meet your brothers,
they will have reason to be proud of you.

1:19:32.541 --> 1:19:33.416
Welcome.

1:19:37.041 --> 1:19:38.083
[Miss Harrison] Girls,

1:19:38.166 --> 1:19:40.416
-you are here for one reason...
-[bell dinging]

1:19:40.500 --> 1:19:42.375
...and one reason only.

1:19:43.166 --> 1:19:46.291
You are here to be made into young ladies.

1:19:46.375 --> 1:19:47.500
How do we laugh?

1:19:47.583 --> 1:19:48.958
We laugh politely.

1:19:49.333 --> 1:19:50.333
Ha, ha, ha.

1:19:50.833 --> 1:19:52.041
[girls] Ha, ha, ha.

1:19:52.541 --> 1:19:54.500
[Miss Harrison]
You all have the potential,

1:19:55.250 --> 1:19:57.666
but you are untapped,

1:19:58.208 --> 1:19:59.750
-untested...
-[grunts]

1:19:59.833 --> 1:20:02.875
...and most of all, untrained.

1:20:03.416 --> 1:20:05.333
Walk as we show you to.

1:20:05.416 --> 1:20:07.250
Eyes up! Up, up, up!

1:20:07.708 --> 1:20:10.208
Speak as we tell you to.

1:20:10.291 --> 1:20:13.708
What whim led white Whitney to whittle?

1:20:14.250 --> 1:20:17.916
[girls] What whim led white Whitney
to whittle?

1:20:18.000 --> 1:20:21.625
[Miss Harrison]
Act, think, be as we tell you,

1:20:22.041 --> 1:20:24.583
and you'll become acceptable wives

1:20:25.041 --> 1:20:26.875
and responsible mothers.

1:20:27.500 --> 1:20:28.416
[slurping]

1:20:30.250 --> 1:20:31.750
-[Enola slurps]
-[girls giggle]

1:20:31.833 --> 1:20:34.375
[Miss Harrison] Follow the path
of so many girls

1:20:34.458 --> 1:20:36.833
who once stood where you do now.

1:20:36.916 --> 1:20:39.166
And just as we molded them...

1:20:39.250 --> 1:20:40.208
[dishes clatter]

1:20:42.750 --> 1:20:45.541
...so shall we you.

1:20:52.625 --> 1:20:54.875
[Miss Harrison] Do you know why
I am an educator?

1:20:55.791 --> 1:20:57.875
It's because I want to make people happy.

1:20:58.791 --> 1:21:01.666
I want you to live
a full and vibrant life.

1:21:02.416 --> 1:21:05.791
Not with anger and endless questions,
but with answers.

1:21:05.875 --> 1:21:07.833
I prepare my girls for the world,

1:21:07.916 --> 1:21:10.166
for the real world.

1:21:12.458 --> 1:21:13.666
I would never abandon you...

1:21:15.083 --> 1:21:16.833
and leave you to fend for yourself.

1:21:19.666 --> 1:21:20.500
Yes.

1:21:21.666 --> 1:21:22.666
Mycroft told me.

1:21:24.708 --> 1:21:26.208
My mother had her reasons.

1:21:26.916 --> 1:21:28.083
I'm sure she did.

1:21:30.875 --> 1:21:31.916
I knew your mother.

1:21:33.666 --> 1:21:35.166
We were friends for a while.

1:21:36.333 --> 1:21:37.208
At school.

1:21:38.583 --> 1:21:40.208
She was a peculiar little thing.

1:21:40.583 --> 1:21:42.875
Was always unpredictable,
always challenging.

1:21:43.625 --> 1:21:46.458
She never truly cared for anything
except her own...

1:21:47.166 --> 1:21:48.541
unusual ideas.

1:21:49.750 --> 1:21:51.083
She cared for me.

1:21:53.958 --> 1:21:55.333
Then why did she leave you?

1:22:02.208 --> 1:22:04.708
Prefects will accompany you
to and from lessons.

1:22:04.791 --> 1:22:06.833
This door will always be kept locked.

1:22:08.958 --> 1:22:09.958
You'll thank me...

1:22:10.541 --> 1:22:11.583
one day,

1:22:11.666 --> 1:22:14.541
when you're happily married
with a pair of strapping boys.

1:22:16.458 --> 1:22:18.291
Sleep well, Enola.

1:22:19.333 --> 1:22:20.958
[door creaks, closes]

1:22:21.041 --> 1:22:21.875
[lock clicks]

1:22:23.250 --> 1:22:24.083
[sighs]

1:22:25.458 --> 1:22:26.291
[grunts]

1:22:36.208 --> 1:22:38.666
[Miss Harrison] Your brother's here.
Smart collar.

1:22:44.958 --> 1:22:45.958
Mr. Holmes.

1:22:51.375 --> 1:22:52.208
You.

1:22:54.125 --> 1:22:55.416
Thank you, Miss Harrison.

1:22:57.791 --> 1:22:58.625
Oh.

1:22:59.333 --> 1:23:00.166
Of course.

1:23:04.833 --> 1:23:05.666
[door closes]

1:23:06.125 --> 1:23:09.000
I have never seen
such a range of romances in my life.

1:23:09.708 --> 1:23:11.625
It's enough to turn you to newspapers.

1:23:14.666 --> 1:23:16.541
What in heaven's are you looking for?

1:23:18.208 --> 1:23:21.083
Why might you be interested
in the personals? You've gone quite mad.

1:23:21.666 --> 1:23:24.166
I have a right to be mad
in a place like this.

1:23:25.791 --> 1:23:27.875
I was forced into calligraphy as a child.

1:23:28.458 --> 1:23:29.291
Ah.

1:23:30.833 --> 1:23:32.625
Hated it, but there's rarely a case

1:23:32.708 --> 1:23:35.541
where someone's handwriting
doesn't tell me something I need to know.

1:23:35.625 --> 1:23:37.916
And what might I learn from deportment?

1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:42.166
The way a person stands
may disguise who they are.

1:23:43.208 --> 1:23:44.125
Nothing's wasted.

1:23:45.458 --> 1:23:46.500
Have you found her?

1:23:47.250 --> 1:23:48.833
No, not yet.

1:23:49.333 --> 1:23:52.583
I went to the tearooms,
where Edith threatened me with a teapot.

1:23:55.083 --> 1:23:56.250
And to Limehouse.

1:23:58.166 --> 1:23:59.750
I believe you went there too.

1:24:02.666 --> 1:24:03.541
[chuckles]

1:24:04.333 --> 1:24:06.416
You've become quite the detective, Enola.

1:24:08.041 --> 1:24:09.333
Did you find the gunpowder?

1:24:09.416 --> 1:24:10.750
-And the bombs?
-I did.

1:24:12.625 --> 1:24:14.583
-Why would she--
-[Sherlock] I shudder to think.

1:24:17.375 --> 1:24:19.333
Perhaps she wants to change the world.

1:24:21.791 --> 1:24:23.875
Perhaps it's a world that needs changing.

1:24:27.875 --> 1:24:28.791
Will you stop her?

1:24:29.291 --> 1:24:31.041
I don't get involved in politics.

1:24:32.291 --> 1:24:34.458
Or people, either, unless they're clues.

1:24:36.291 --> 1:24:37.958
-Did you help Mycroft catch me?
-No.

1:24:38.041 --> 1:24:40.250
But you found out about the money.
You told him.

1:24:40.333 --> 1:24:43.333
You disappeared.
We had to know how far you would run.

1:24:43.416 --> 1:24:45.458
I'm just a case to you, aren't I?

1:24:45.541 --> 1:24:48.375
A curiosity. Is that why you're here,
to pick my brains?

1:24:48.458 --> 1:24:50.750
-No.
-Or possibly you're feeling guilty.

1:24:50.833 --> 1:24:52.458
I'm here because I care for you.

1:24:57.583 --> 1:24:58.916
You're being emotional.

1:25:00.833 --> 1:25:02.583
It's understandable, but unnecessary.

1:25:11.958 --> 1:25:14.625
-[Sherlock] It's an intrigue, isn't it?
-[Enola] Emotion?

1:25:15.416 --> 1:25:16.541
The Tewkesbury case.

1:25:18.666 --> 1:25:21.166
A bit more complicated
than a simple disappearance.

1:25:22.083 --> 1:25:23.458
He jumped from the train...

1:25:24.625 --> 1:25:25.625
with another boy.

1:25:27.250 --> 1:25:28.833
Were they being chased, do you think?

1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:31.125
How did you know that?

1:25:31.583 --> 1:25:34.666
I traced your departure
to the same station that he left from.

1:25:35.500 --> 1:25:38.333
Edith mentioned "a useless boy."

1:25:40.083 --> 1:25:44.458
And I was telegrammed
about a young female assistant of mine

1:25:44.833 --> 1:25:46.750
who visited the Tewkesbury residence.

1:25:49.750 --> 1:25:50.875
Have you solved it?

1:25:53.208 --> 1:25:54.041
Not yet.

1:25:55.125 --> 1:25:56.875
The only advice I can give to you,

1:25:58.333 --> 1:25:59.750
one detective to another,

1:26:01.875 --> 1:26:04.250
sometimes you must dangle your feet
in the water

1:26:04.625 --> 1:26:06.208
in order to attract the sharks.

1:26:07.500 --> 1:26:09.000
So that's why you came here.

1:26:10.250 --> 1:26:11.375
Shark lessons.

1:26:13.125 --> 1:26:13.958
No, no.

1:26:16.125 --> 1:26:17.416
I came here... [sighs]

1:26:17.500 --> 1:26:18.375
to give you this.

1:26:28.500 --> 1:26:29.958
I found it under her pillow.

1:26:31.208 --> 1:26:32.333
She kept it, you see.

1:26:33.125 --> 1:26:34.000
[Enola] Dash...

1:26:34.625 --> 1:26:36.500
Sentimental, really, but she always did...

1:26:38.458 --> 1:26:40.791
She always found you quite extraordinary.

1:26:47.041 --> 1:26:49.125
As do I, Enola Holmes.

1:26:56.041 --> 1:26:57.583
The choice is always yours.

1:26:58.833 --> 1:27:00.750
Whatever society may claim,

1:27:01.625 --> 1:27:02.750
it can't control you.

1:27:04.916 --> 1:27:06.250
As Mother has proven.

1:27:07.583 --> 1:27:08.791
[Enola breathes sharply]

1:27:10.083 --> 1:27:11.041
Keep the paper.

1:27:12.541 --> 1:27:14.125
[footsteps depart]

1:27:15.375 --> 1:27:16.625
[door opens]

1:27:40.250 --> 1:27:42.375
[Enola] Mother thought
I was extraordinary.

1:27:44.041 --> 1:27:45.958
Extraordinary...

1:27:46.625 --> 1:27:47.500
[chuckles]

1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:02.250
The Lords...

1:28:10.208 --> 1:28:11.125
Lord.

1:28:14.500 --> 1:28:16.458
"Every vote counts."

1:28:23.833 --> 1:28:24.666
-[knocking]
-[gasps]

1:28:24.750 --> 1:28:26.166
[man] Delivery from Ferndell Hall.

1:28:29.000 --> 1:28:30.583
Care of Mr. Mycroft Holmes.

1:28:32.125 --> 1:28:33.708
What does he want? [sighs]

1:28:33.791 --> 1:28:35.541
Well... [sighs] whatever it is,

1:28:36.083 --> 1:28:37.000
it's heavy.

1:28:37.416 --> 1:28:39.125
[grunting]

1:28:39.208 --> 1:28:40.083
[thuds]

1:28:40.916 --> 1:28:43.333
-[door closes]
-What on earth does Mycroft want?

1:28:43.416 --> 1:28:44.500
[basket rustling]

1:28:46.291 --> 1:28:47.916
[continues rustling]

1:28:50.958 --> 1:28:52.083
[sneezes]

1:28:53.291 --> 1:28:54.125
[male voice] Ow!

1:28:55.791 --> 1:28:56.791
[breathing heavily]

1:28:56.875 --> 1:28:58.041
Tewkesbury!

1:28:58.416 --> 1:28:59.458
[chuckling] Whoa!

1:28:59.541 --> 1:29:00.958
[breathing heavily]

1:29:01.041 --> 1:29:04.041
You're supposed to be helping me out,
not getting in with me.

1:29:04.375 --> 1:29:05.291
[Tewkesbury chuckles]

1:29:05.375 --> 1:29:08.291
-How did you find me?
-Well, you said you didn't want to come

1:29:08.375 --> 1:29:10.625
to Miss Harrison's Finishing School
for Young Ladies.

1:29:11.083 --> 1:29:13.458
I have quite the prodigious memory
when I choose to use it.

1:29:14.833 --> 1:29:17.125
So I thought we'd go out
the same way I came in.

1:29:17.208 --> 1:29:18.083
[Enola] Huh.

1:29:18.916 --> 1:29:20.666
I even wore my most porter-ish coat.

1:29:21.708 --> 1:29:23.375
That's an excellent idea!

1:29:25.375 --> 1:29:27.291
Nope! Nope, nope, nope. Help me up.

1:29:27.375 --> 1:29:30.250
Miss Harrison,
she will see right through you.

1:29:31.041 --> 1:29:34.333
-[Tewkesbury] Oh! I knew there was a flaw!
-Shh. Let me think.

1:29:37.458 --> 1:29:38.625
Do you have any ideas?

1:29:41.166 --> 1:29:42.875
[grunting]

1:29:46.083 --> 1:29:47.000
[Enola groans]

1:29:47.083 --> 1:29:48.333
-[Tewkesbury] Quiet!
-[grunts]

1:29:57.625 --> 1:29:58.500
[grunts]

1:29:59.125 --> 1:30:00.375
[Miss Harrison] Stop there.

1:30:02.250 --> 1:30:03.458
Who are you?

1:30:04.291 --> 1:30:06.375
Have you permission to be in this school?

1:30:07.041 --> 1:30:07.916
Um...

1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:10.041
I was just delivering a package, miss.

1:30:11.291 --> 1:30:12.666
Um, to the headmistress.

1:30:14.958 --> 1:30:17.166
Could you please direct me to her office?

1:30:18.666 --> 1:30:20.916
I am the headmistress of the school.

1:30:24.458 --> 1:30:26.625
Well, then, um, this is for you.

1:30:28.541 --> 1:30:30.291
Well, open it up.
Let me see what's inside.

1:30:30.375 --> 1:30:32.333
Oh, I can't, miss.
I was given express instructions

1:30:32.416 --> 1:30:33.708
that this be opened in private.

1:30:33.791 --> 1:30:36.333
-Oh, how ridiculous.
-By my employer, miss.

1:30:36.416 --> 1:30:38.125
[Miss Harrison] And who might that be?

1:30:39.083 --> 1:30:40.041
Mycroft Holmes.

1:30:40.500 --> 1:30:41.875
[bell ringing]

1:30:43.041 --> 1:30:44.000
Mycroft Holmes...

1:30:46.083 --> 1:30:47.875
[students approaching]

1:30:48.875 --> 1:30:49.916
Girls...

1:30:50.416 --> 1:30:54.166
Would you just take this parcel
into my office

1:30:54.541 --> 1:30:56.541
that I might open it later?

1:30:57.541 --> 1:30:58.875
[girls grunt]

1:30:58.958 --> 1:31:00.000
[girls breathing heavily]

1:31:00.083 --> 1:31:02.125
-[Miss Harrison] No dilly-dallying.
-[girl] Ouch!

1:31:02.208 --> 1:31:03.833
Oh, this weighs a ton!

1:31:04.875 --> 1:31:06.083
[girls grunting]

1:31:06.166 --> 1:31:09.250
-Why is it so heavy?
-So, what are you waiting for? A tip?

1:31:10.416 --> 1:31:12.458
-Go on, begone.
-[basket thuds]

1:31:12.541 --> 1:31:13.541
[girls sighing]

1:31:44.250 --> 1:31:47.000

1:31:50.291 --> 1:31:51.750
[lively music plays]

1:31:56.916 --> 1:31:59.916
-[Tewkesbury] Can you actually drive this?
-I know the basic rudiments.

1:32:00.750 --> 1:32:01.583

1:32:04.458 --> 1:32:06.041
[car sputtering]

1:32:06.458 --> 1:32:07.416
My automobile!

1:32:07.500 --> 1:32:09.208
[Tewkesbury]
Left, right, watch out, Enola!

1:32:09.291 --> 1:32:10.875
-Oh, no!
-[Tewkesbury] The bush!

1:32:11.166 --> 1:32:12.875
-[Enola] Whoo-hoo!
-[Tewkesbury] Enola!

1:32:12.958 --> 1:32:17.083
-[Enola] I'm not finished yet!
-[Miss Harrison gasping]

1:32:17.166 --> 1:32:19.833
-[Miss Harrison screams]
-[tires screeching]

1:32:20.833 --> 1:32:23.125
Thank you. That was, uh...

1:32:23.708 --> 1:32:24.833
You did save me.

1:32:25.250 --> 1:32:26.125
[Tewkesbury chuckles]

1:32:27.000 --> 1:32:29.375
The best bit was my idea,
but you did save me.

1:32:29.458 --> 1:32:30.958
You're welcome. I think.

1:32:31.458 --> 1:32:32.791
I didn't like it in there.

1:32:33.791 --> 1:32:35.375
No. No, of course not.

1:32:37.000 --> 1:32:40.458
Now, let's get back to London
and find a proper hiding place.

1:32:41.666 --> 1:32:43.916
[brakes screeching]

1:32:48.500 --> 1:32:50.000
[Tewkesbury] Why have we stopped?

1:32:53.333 --> 1:32:55.041
Enola, whatever you're planning...

1:32:55.708 --> 1:32:57.041
[Eudoria] There'll come a time

1:32:57.416 --> 1:32:59.583
when you have to make a hard choice.

1:33:00.083 --> 1:33:02.625
-Enola...
-[Eudoria] And, in that moment,

1:33:02.708 --> 1:33:05.500
you will discover
what mettle you truly have,

1:33:06.666 --> 1:33:08.625
and what you're prepared to risk,

1:33:09.500 --> 1:33:10.750
for what matters.

1:33:12.500 --> 1:33:14.416
Your move, Enola.

1:33:20.500 --> 1:33:22.125
We need to go to Basilwether.

1:33:22.208 --> 1:33:23.041
What?!

1:33:23.541 --> 1:33:26.625
An injustice has occurred.
It's time to right some wrongs.

1:33:27.333 --> 1:33:29.166
You want a culprit, find the motive.

1:33:31.041 --> 1:33:32.875
-I don't understand.
-When were you due

1:33:32.958 --> 1:33:35.666
-to be inducted into the Lords?
-I'm Viscount Tewkesbury.

1:33:35.750 --> 1:33:37.833
-Well, he's a bloomin' marquess.
-Imminently.

1:33:37.916 --> 1:33:40.583
-How would you have voted on the bill?
-Votes for all men!

1:33:40.666 --> 1:33:43.666
-The same as my father. I'd be for it.
-Who knew that?

1:33:43.750 --> 1:33:44.750
I had these ideas,

1:33:44.833 --> 1:33:47.583
but my family were set on me
joining the army and going overseas.

1:33:47.666 --> 1:33:50.666
And who stands to gain the estate
with your father dead and if you die?

1:33:52.166 --> 1:33:53.000
My uncle.

1:33:53.083 --> 1:33:55.708
My sister-in-law
has all the help she needs. Show her out.

1:33:55.791 --> 1:33:57.333
You think this is my uncle's doing?

1:33:58.541 --> 1:33:59.541
Doesn't it make sense?

1:34:01.291 --> 1:34:03.916
[Tewkesbury] But he's a powerful man.
What on earth could we do?

1:34:04.375 --> 1:34:05.875
Solve the crime, of course.

1:34:06.500 --> 1:34:09.416
Enola, we are both extremely lucky
to have lived this long,

1:34:09.500 --> 1:34:12.416
and you want to drive us into a place
where there is most certain danger?

1:34:12.500 --> 1:34:14.083
Sometimes, Lord Tewkesbury,

1:34:14.166 --> 1:34:17.083
you have to dangle your legs in the water
to attract the bloody sharks!

1:34:17.166 --> 1:34:19.500
Why would we want to attract
the bloody sharks?

1:34:20.916 --> 1:34:22.083
[sighs] Good point.

1:34:26.916 --> 1:34:28.791
[Tewkesbury] This is a terrible idea.

1:34:28.875 --> 1:34:31.208
The closer we get,
the worse this idea becomes.

1:34:32.166 --> 1:34:33.291
Why are we doing this?

1:34:35.666 --> 1:34:38.833
Unlike most well-bred ladies,
I was never taught to embroider.

1:34:38.916 --> 1:34:41.958
[grunts] I never molded wax roses,
hemmed handkerchiefs,

1:34:42.041 --> 1:34:43.500
or strung seashells.

1:34:43.583 --> 1:34:47.250
I was taught to watch and listen.
I was taught to fight.

1:34:47.333 --> 1:34:49.083
This is what my mother made me for.

1:34:49.583 --> 1:34:50.416
[sighs]

1:34:50.791 --> 1:34:51.666
Trust me...

1:34:52.416 --> 1:34:53.958
to find the answers we need.

1:34:55.500 --> 1:34:57.250
You don't know how to embroider?

1:34:57.750 --> 1:34:58.583
[sighs]

1:34:59.833 --> 1:35:00.791
We need to do this.

1:35:00.875 --> 1:35:03.875
You need to do this. We... are doing this.

1:35:08.958 --> 1:35:09.791
Come on.

1:35:15.791 --> 1:35:17.291
[floor creaking]

1:35:24.458 --> 1:35:25.833
Where are all the servants?

1:35:26.541 --> 1:35:27.875
Welcome to the future.

1:35:33.625 --> 1:35:34.583
Mother?

1:35:48.333 --> 1:35:49.291
What's happening?

1:35:51.541 --> 1:35:52.750
They know we're here.

1:41:44.791 --> 1:41:46.375
[sobbing]

1:41:46.458 --> 1:41:47.833
Wake up. Come on.

1:41:48.583 --> 1:41:49.708
[sobs] No...

1:41:51.916 --> 1:41:52.791
No!

1:41:53.375 --> 1:41:54.250
[sobbing]

1:41:56.791 --> 1:41:58.208
[sobs, sniffles]

1:41:59.541 --> 1:42:00.416
[sobs]

1:42:11.583 --> 1:42:12.416
[gasps]

1:42:13.875 --> 1:42:15.125
[shuddering breaths]

1:42:16.708 --> 1:42:17.666
[gasps]

1:42:17.750 --> 1:42:18.666
Tewkesbury?

1:42:19.875 --> 1:42:20.916
[Tewkesbury grunts]

1:42:22.875 --> 1:42:23.791
Be careful.

1:42:24.250 --> 1:42:25.458
-Be careful.
-[gasps]

1:42:27.500 --> 1:42:29.541
I'm not entirely an idiot, you know.

1:42:36.791 --> 1:42:37.750
[chuckles]

1:42:40.833 --> 1:42:42.333
You were made to fight.

1:43:04.416 --> 1:43:05.291
[Tewkesbury grunts]

1:43:05.375 --> 1:43:06.291
[clatters]

1:43:14.083 --> 1:43:14.916
[Enola pants]

1:43:15.666 --> 1:43:16.875
Your time is over.

1:43:31.375 --> 1:43:33.000
[people chattering]

1:43:39.333 --> 1:43:41.125
-[woman] I was really quite shocked.
-Yep.

1:43:41.416 --> 1:43:42.791
-Sir?
-Don't be ridiculous.

1:43:43.208 --> 1:43:44.416
[indistinct chattering]

1:43:44.500 --> 1:43:45.500
[Sherlock] Lestrade?

1:43:46.291 --> 1:43:47.916
-Lestrade.
-[Lestrade] Ah...

1:43:49.500 --> 1:43:51.083
Sherlock Holmes.

1:43:51.791 --> 1:43:53.666
-We meet again.
-Please.

1:43:59.250 --> 1:44:02.166
You've been building
quite a reputation for yourself,

1:44:02.250 --> 1:44:03.958
despite your best efforts

1:44:04.041 --> 1:44:05.708
-to avoid the press.
-The marquess case.

1:44:05.791 --> 1:44:08.041
You need to arrest his grandmother,
the Dowager.

1:44:08.791 --> 1:44:10.041
She's trying to kill him,

1:44:10.583 --> 1:44:11.833
as she killed his father.

1:44:13.333 --> 1:44:14.250
Two questions.

1:44:14.875 --> 1:44:16.500
How did you arrive at that conclusion?

1:44:18.625 --> 1:44:22.208
It's a question of divided loyalty
and succession.

1:44:22.750 --> 1:44:26.083
With the boy dead, the uncle would take
the vacant seat in the Lords

1:44:26.166 --> 1:44:29.000
and stand against the reform bill
and the extension of the vote,

1:44:29.083 --> 1:44:31.625
just as the Dowager wanted.

1:44:32.583 --> 1:44:34.708
The boy, I deduce, would not,
nor would his father have.

1:44:35.916 --> 1:44:38.833
So why would it not be the uncle himself
that did the deed?

1:44:39.583 --> 1:44:40.833
To the father or the son?

1:44:41.958 --> 1:44:42.791
Father?

1:44:45.291 --> 1:44:48.750
His uniform in the press photographs.

1:44:48.833 --> 1:44:49.666
Oh.

1:44:50.125 --> 1:44:51.833
[Sherlock] The medals on his chest.

1:44:51.916 --> 1:44:54.791
He wasn't in the country
when the boy's father was killed,

1:44:55.833 --> 1:44:58.541
-rather serving in the Afghan War.
-[Lestrade chuckles]

1:45:00.666 --> 1:45:02.291
It's always there, the truth.

1:45:02.375 --> 1:45:03.208
Yeah.

1:45:04.916 --> 1:45:06.375
You just need to look for it.

1:45:07.166 --> 1:45:08.541
[Lestrade] Second question.

1:45:10.958 --> 1:45:13.333
How did your sister get there before ya?

1:45:15.583 --> 1:45:16.500
I'm sorry?

1:45:20.750 --> 1:45:22.291
[men chattering indistinctly]

1:45:24.791 --> 1:45:25.625
Ha!

1:45:37.416 --> 1:45:38.458
[Tewkesbury] I look fine.

1:45:38.541 --> 1:45:40.458
[Sir Whimbrel]
Don't fuss over him, Caroline.

1:45:40.541 --> 1:45:42.125
-Please, Mother.
-Oh, can I just--

1:45:42.208 --> 1:45:44.666
Don't. I'm trying to have
these men's respect.

1:45:45.875 --> 1:45:47.541
It's quite the style, you know.

1:45:47.625 --> 1:45:50.458
Yes. I suppose
it sets your face off nicely.

1:45:52.958 --> 1:45:54.791
Your father would be very proud of you.

1:46:09.583 --> 1:46:13.250
Congratulations. You finally look
like the nincompoop you were born to be.

1:46:14.958 --> 1:46:16.333
-[chuckles]
-[Enola] No.

1:46:16.791 --> 1:46:17.833
You look good.

1:46:18.583 --> 1:46:19.875
This is... good.

1:46:20.625 --> 1:46:23.458
The vote is in an hour. It's, um...
It's quite the thing.

1:46:24.916 --> 1:46:27.958
I'm not supposed to bow or anything, am I,
now that you are whatever you are?

1:46:28.041 --> 1:46:30.208
Well, arguably, you always had to bow.

1:46:30.291 --> 1:46:32.208
You just... chose not to.

1:46:32.291 --> 1:46:33.166
[chuckles]

1:46:35.083 --> 1:46:36.916
So, uh, are you safe? Are you...

1:46:37.291 --> 1:46:38.666
Are you-- are you comfortable?

1:46:39.625 --> 1:46:40.583
You're not still living

1:46:40.666 --> 1:46:42.916
-in that terrible lodgings house, are you?
-No. [chuckles]

1:46:43.000 --> 1:46:44.791
I used the reward money
your mother gave me...

1:46:44.875 --> 1:46:47.500
-Which you reluctantly took.
-...and found somewhere new.

1:46:48.375 --> 1:46:51.041
Well, Mother has said that there's, um...

1:46:51.125 --> 1:46:52.916
there's... there's always room for you
with us.

1:46:53.000 --> 1:46:55.000
Your mother clearly hasn't spent
enough time with me.

1:46:58.375 --> 1:46:59.791
And what if it was I that...

1:47:00.583 --> 1:47:01.583
asked you to stay?

1:47:04.583 --> 1:47:05.541
A kind offer,

1:47:05.916 --> 1:47:07.166
but one I must refuse.

1:47:23.208 --> 1:47:24.041
I...

1:47:24.666 --> 1:47:25.708
How will I... How...

1:47:26.666 --> 1:47:28.083
When will I see you again?

1:47:29.916 --> 1:47:31.166
You're not rid of me yet,

1:47:31.250 --> 1:47:33.875
Viscount Tewkesbury,
Marquess of Basilwether.

1:47:40.833 --> 1:47:41.666
[sighs]

1:47:57.708 --> 1:47:58.541
[chuckles]

1:48:01.791 --> 1:48:02.666
[sniffles]

1:48:04.208 --> 1:48:05.083
Ah.

1:48:12.291 --> 1:48:13.250
[man] Thank you.

1:48:14.875 --> 1:48:16.125
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1:48:17.291 --> 1:48:18.166
[sighs]

1:48:21.000 --> 1:48:22.041
[Enola] Mother.

1:48:23.708 --> 1:48:25.083
May I borrow your pencil?

1:48:25.541 --> 1:48:26.625
Thank you.

1:48:30.625 --> 1:48:33.541
Numbers turn into letters,

1:48:33.625 --> 1:48:36.166
which forms into...

1:48:36.625 --> 1:48:38.875
[Enola] Five, two, five, five,
three, three, one.

1:48:39.500 --> 1:48:41.166
-One, one, one.
-[sighs]

1:48:41.250 --> 1:48:43.291
[continues reading numbers indistinctly]

1:48:44.958 --> 1:48:45.791
[sighs]

1:48:45.875 --> 1:48:48.958
"Meet me Royal Academy
five tonight Mother."

1:48:50.708 --> 1:48:51.541
Well,

1:48:52.625 --> 1:48:53.916
that's unexpected.

1:48:55.958 --> 1:48:56.875
Thank you.

1:48:56.958 --> 1:48:59.250
There are three thoughts
that immediately occur.

1:48:59.333 --> 1:49:02.333
One is that Mother wouldn't have signed
"Mother," but "Chrysanthemum."

1:49:03.375 --> 1:49:05.583
And two,
the Royal Academy is an institution

1:49:05.666 --> 1:49:08.125
that has consistently neglected
to include women.

1:49:08.666 --> 1:49:11.166
Mother wouldn't have suggested it
as a meeting place.

1:49:11.250 --> 1:49:14.083
And my final thought
is that I may have revealed my hand

1:49:14.166 --> 1:49:16.125
in front of my brother
when checking the newspaper.

1:49:17.291 --> 1:49:19.083
This is Sherlock Holmes's doing.

1:49:22.833 --> 1:49:26.125
And yet, facts don't distract from hope.

1:49:27.333 --> 1:49:29.875
I'll pay you five pounds
to swap clothes with me.

1:49:34.916 --> 1:49:35.916
[Sherlock] Anything?

1:49:37.083 --> 1:49:38.333
[Mycroft] Nothing at all.

1:49:39.125 --> 1:49:41.208
She beat you once before, little brother,

1:49:41.708 --> 1:49:43.500
and now she may have done so again.

1:49:43.583 --> 1:49:45.666
Oh, I do believe she thought it me,

1:49:46.208 --> 1:49:48.458
but I also believe
that she'd be too intrigued

1:49:48.541 --> 1:49:50.416
not to be here all the same.

1:49:50.500 --> 1:49:52.208
Unfortunately, you were wrong.

1:49:53.666 --> 1:49:55.250
-[Mycroft chuckles]
-It's possible.

1:49:55.875 --> 1:49:58.250
Nevertheless, if we do find her again,

1:49:58.333 --> 1:49:59.750
I'd like her to be my ward.

1:50:00.416 --> 1:50:01.541
I'll take care of her.

1:50:03.291 --> 1:50:05.458
Well... [sighs] on your head be it.

1:50:06.458 --> 1:50:07.916
I washed my hands of her.

1:50:08.458 --> 1:50:09.375
Very well.

1:50:10.250 --> 1:50:11.125
All the better.

1:50:13.208 --> 1:50:15.791
You are a strange fish, little brother.

1:50:16.875 --> 1:50:19.083
And you're a cantankerous one,
older brother.

1:50:19.625 --> 1:50:22.375
I assume you're being so delightful
because of the vote?

1:50:22.750 --> 1:50:24.000
Passed by one.

1:50:24.083 --> 1:50:27.166
That reemerging little toadstool,
the Marquess of Tewkesbury,

1:50:27.250 --> 1:50:28.916
and his vote proved decisive.

1:50:29.416 --> 1:50:32.000
Now, much as I enjoy
standing outside the Royal Academy--

1:50:32.083 --> 1:50:34.500
-He's an interesting character, you know?
-[Mycroft] Hmm?

1:50:34.583 --> 1:50:36.708
And I suspect he's rather keen
on young Enola.

1:50:36.791 --> 1:50:39.500
Then he should marry her.
Maybe it'll tame them both.

1:50:40.291 --> 1:50:42.291
Drink at the club to commiserate me?

1:50:43.333 --> 1:50:45.875
Yes, I'll buy you a drink, Mycroft.

1:51:09.333 --> 1:51:10.750
[Mycroft] Come on, Sherlock!

1:51:21.500 --> 1:51:22.583
[cobbler] Here you go, sir.

1:51:25.291 --> 1:51:26.125
[coin clatters]

1:51:35.833 --> 1:51:37.291
What on earth were you doing?

1:51:38.583 --> 1:51:39.958
[Sherlock] Thought I saw something.

1:52:11.125 --> 1:52:13.166
-Good afternoon, Enola.
-Good afternoon.

1:52:13.250 --> 1:52:14.375
You've got a visitor.

1:52:25.875 --> 1:52:26.750
[inhales sharply]

1:52:27.208 --> 1:52:29.458
This is a surprisingly nice room.

1:52:30.875 --> 1:52:32.333
I like the finishing touches.

1:52:38.958 --> 1:52:40.958
[inhales sharply] I can't stay long.

1:52:42.291 --> 1:52:43.625
People might be watching.

1:52:46.708 --> 1:52:48.291
How on earth did you find that?

1:52:49.000 --> 1:52:49.875
Sherlock did.

1:52:52.083 --> 1:52:53.791
I thought you had forgotten it.

1:52:55.916 --> 1:52:58.291
You never could leave it alone
as a little girl.

1:52:58.375 --> 1:53:01.083
-You used to drag it around behind you--
-Sherlock said.

1:53:03.583 --> 1:53:06.375
-You'd heard Queen Victoria had--
-Sherlock said that too.

1:53:13.083 --> 1:53:13.916
Well...

1:53:14.875 --> 1:53:16.708
nice that you two have connected.

1:53:24.916 --> 1:53:25.833
I'm sorry.

1:53:30.458 --> 1:53:31.500
I'm sorry.

1:53:34.416 --> 1:53:36.500
I wanted to tell you where I was going,

1:53:37.833 --> 1:53:38.875
but it wasn't safe.

1:53:41.291 --> 1:53:42.416
Are you safe now?

1:53:43.750 --> 1:53:44.833
[shuddering breaths]

1:53:45.291 --> 1:53:48.625
I didn't leave you
because I didn't love you.

1:53:51.958 --> 1:53:53.500
I left for you...

1:53:54.625 --> 1:53:55.875
because I couldn't bear...

1:53:56.625 --> 1:54:00.875
to have this world be your future.

1:54:03.666 --> 1:54:04.833
So I had to fight.

1:54:07.000 --> 1:54:08.833
You have to make some noise

1:54:09.291 --> 1:54:10.500
if you want to be heard.

1:54:14.458 --> 1:54:15.916
Oh, it's funny. [chuckles]

1:54:16.375 --> 1:54:17.250
I thought...

1:54:18.375 --> 1:54:21.666
I was the one
that was going to change the world.

1:54:24.458 --> 1:54:25.541
The reform bill,

1:54:26.875 --> 1:54:29.250
is it true what you did?

1:54:29.666 --> 1:54:30.708
[chuckles]

1:54:30.791 --> 1:54:31.625
[sniffles]

1:54:33.958 --> 1:54:35.958
What a woman you've become.

1:54:36.750 --> 1:54:37.625
[sniffles]

1:54:38.041 --> 1:54:38.958
[Eudoria chuckles]

1:54:42.666 --> 1:54:43.875
[breathes deeply]

1:54:44.541 --> 1:54:46.458
[shuddering breaths]

1:54:52.791 --> 1:54:53.708
[Eudoria sniffles]

1:54:58.875 --> 1:54:59.833
[both chuckle]

1:55:02.625 --> 1:55:03.541
[Eudoria sniffles]

1:55:07.333 --> 1:55:08.875
Thank you for your irises.

1:55:10.708 --> 1:55:11.666
Now, if you ever...

1:55:12.416 --> 1:55:13.458
ever need me,

1:55:14.375 --> 1:55:15.833
I'll be looking out for them.

1:55:19.333 --> 1:55:21.000
-You have to go.
-Yes, but...

1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:24.833
let's just stay like this for a bit.

1:55:27.083 --> 1:55:28.333
I'd like that too.

1:55:38.625 --> 1:55:40.500
[Enola] So, how to conclude?

1:55:43.166 --> 1:55:44.166
My name is Enola,

1:55:45.000 --> 1:55:46.875
which, backwards, spells "alone."

1:55:47.708 --> 1:55:49.791
To be a Holmes,
you must find your own path.

1:55:50.666 --> 1:55:51.583
My brothers have,

1:55:53.250 --> 1:55:54.291
my mother has,

1:55:55.291 --> 1:55:56.458
and I must too.

1:55:57.708 --> 1:55:59.250
[both grunting]

1:55:59.333 --> 1:56:02.500
But I now see that being alone
doesn't mean I have to be lonely.

1:56:03.416 --> 1:56:04.750
Mother never wanted that.

1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:08.041
She wanted me to find my freedom,

1:56:08.833 --> 1:56:09.875
my future,

1:56:10.875 --> 1:56:11.958
my purpose.

1:56:13.333 --> 1:56:14.583
I am a detective,

1:56:15.625 --> 1:56:16.916
I am a decipherer,

1:56:17.000 --> 1:56:19.583
and I am a finder of lost souls.

1:56:19.666 --> 1:56:20.833
[Enola laughing]

1:56:20.916 --> 1:56:22.583
[Eudoria laughs]

1:56:22.666 --> 1:56:23.833
My life is my own.

1:56:26.625 --> 1:56:29.000
And the future is up to us.

1:56:51.500 --> 1:56:52.750
