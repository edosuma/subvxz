00:53.717 --> 00:55.594
<i>Long ago...</i>

00:55.677 --> 00:58.316
<i>... in the early years of the Second Age...</i>

00:58.797 --> 01:02.233
<i>... the great Elven-smiths</i>
<i>forged Rings of Power.</i>

01:02.597 --> 01:04.952
<i>Nine for mortal Men.</i>

01:06.037 --> 01:09.074
<i>Seven for the Dwarf-lords.</i>

01:09.717 --> 01:13.346
<i>Three for the tall Elf-kings.</i>

01:14.357 --> 01:18.350
<i>But then</i>, <i>the Dark Lord learned</i>
<i>the craft of ring-making...</i>

01:18.437 --> 01:21.076
<i>... and made the Master Ring.</i>

01:21.157 --> 01:23.796
<i>The One Ring to rule them all.</i>

01:24.277 --> 01:29.670
<i>With the One Ring</i>, <i>Middle-earth is his</i>
<i>and he cannot be overcome.</i>

01:30.277 --> 01:34.270
<i>As the last alliance of Men and Elves</i>
<i>fell beneath his power...</i>

01:34.517 --> 01:38.715
<i>... he did not notice the heroic shadow</i>
<i>who slipped in.</i>

01:40.677 --> 01:43.316
<i>It was Prince Isildur...</i>

01:43.677 --> 01:46.316
<i>... of the mighty kings from across the sea...</i>

01:46.597 --> 01:48.428
<i>... who took the Ring.</i>

01:52.757 --> 01:57.706
<i>But because he did not destroy it</i>,
<i>the spirit of the Dark Lord lived on...</i>

01:58.837 --> 02:01.749
<i>... and began to take shape and grow again.</i>

02:02.837 --> 02:06.910
<i>But the Ring had a will of its own</i>,
<i>and a way of slipping from one hand...</i>

02:06.997 --> 02:11.991
<i>... to be found by another</i>, <i>so that it</i>
<i>might at last get back to its master.</i>

02:13.237 --> 02:17.230
<i>And there the Ring lay</i>,
<i>at the bottom of the Great River Anduin...</i>

02:17.877 --> 02:19.833
<i>... for thousands of years.</i>

02:22.197 --> 02:23.676
<i>During those years...</i>

02:24.117 --> 02:27.712
<i>... the Dark Lord captured the nine Rings</i>
<i>that were made for Men...</i>

02:28.197 --> 02:31.587
<i>... and turned their owners</i>
<i>into the Ringwraiths:</i>

02:32.037 --> 02:35.950
<i>Terrible shadows under his great shadow...</i>

02:36.517 --> 02:40.635
<i>... who roamed the world</i>,
<i>searching for the One Ring.</i>

02:42.197 --> 02:45.234
<i>In time</i>, <i>the Ring was found.</i>

02:45.437 --> 02:48.588
<i>Two friends were fishing</i>
<i>in the Great River one day.</i>

02:59.677 --> 03:02.908
- Give us that, Déagol, my love.
- Why, Sméagol?

03:02.997 --> 03:07.388
Because it's my birthday,
my love, and I wants it.

03:07.957 --> 03:10.755
I have already given you
more than I could afford.

03:10.837 --> 03:14.193
I found this, and I'm going to keep it!

03:15.877 --> 03:18.675
Are you indeed, my love?

03:24.997 --> 03:28.512
<i>He used the Ring for thieving</i>,
<i>and to find out secrets.</i>

03:29.517 --> 03:32.907
<i>His own people began to despise</i>
<i>the wretched creature...</i>

03:32.997 --> 03:36.194
<i>... and to call him Gollum.</i>

03:36.797 --> 03:41.109
<i>Tortured and driven by the Ring</i>,
<i>he hid in dark caves...</i>

03:41.517 --> 03:44.077
<i>... under deep mountains.</i>

03:46.757 --> 03:49.635
<i>But the Ring</i>
<i>slipped off Gollum's finger</i>, <i>too.</i>

03:51.637 --> 03:56.552
<i>And so it was that Bilbo found it</i>,
<i>during his travels with the Dwarves.</i>

04:00.517 --> 04:02.906
Thief, Baggins. Thief!

04:03.157 --> 04:06.513
It stole our precious, our precious...

04:06.717 --> 04:09.436
Our birthday present.

04:09.557 --> 04:12.708
Thief, Baggins! We hates it forever!

04:16.557 --> 04:19.355
<i>It was Bilbo Baggins</i>, <i>the Hobbit...</i>

04:19.517 --> 04:21.985
<i>... who took the Ring back to the Shire</i>,
<i>his home.</i>

04:23.877 --> 04:25.310
<i>Years later...</i>

04:25.397 --> 04:30.312
<i>... Gandalf the Wizard</i>, <i>visited Bilbo</i>
<i>on his going-away birthday party.</i>

04:35.757 --> 04:39.466
I don't know half of you
half as well as I should like...

04:40.157 --> 04:43.991
...and I like less than half of you
half as well as you deserve.

04:45.077 --> 04:48.353
Frodo, I can see your uncle Bilbo
hasn't changed much.

04:49.237 --> 04:52.707
And though 111 years
is far too short a time...

04:52.797 --> 04:56.312
...to live among such admirable Bagginses
and Boffinses, Grubbs...

04:56.397 --> 04:58.592
...Chubbs, Brace-girdles, Goodbodies...

04:58.677 --> 05:01.874
...Bolgers, Hornblowers and Proudfoots...
- Proudfeet!

05:03.757 --> 05:07.227
...I regret to announce that this is the end.

05:07.637 --> 05:11.152
I'm going away. I'm leaving. Now.

05:12.477 --> 05:13.876
Goodbye.

05:16.037 --> 05:17.550
Where did he go?

05:30.877 --> 05:32.230
Oh, Gandalf.

05:32.517 --> 05:35.315
Have you left the Ring for Frodo,
as we agreed?

05:35.557 --> 05:38.515
It's mine, I tell you! It's my own.

05:39.437 --> 05:41.234
My precious!

05:41.317 --> 05:43.706
It's mine now, and I shall keep it.

05:43.797 --> 05:46.436
I won't give my precious away, I tell you.

05:46.517 --> 05:48.747
Do not say that again!

05:51.157 --> 05:53.910
Give it to Frodo, and I will look after him.

06:03.357 --> 06:06.508
All right, I will.

06:24.277 --> 06:27.553
<i>Seventeen years passed sleepily</i>
<i>in the Shire.</i>

06:50.037 --> 06:52.426
All right, just a minute!

06:57.397 --> 06:58.546
Gandalf!

06:59.477 --> 07:01.354
Greetings, Frodo.

07:02.357 --> 07:05.349
Gandalf, it's really you!
Oh, it's been so long!

07:05.437 --> 07:06.995
Seventeen years...

07:07.077 --> 07:10.752
...since Bilbo left.
You look the same as ever, Frodo.

07:11.477 --> 07:13.274
You look older, Gandalf.

07:13.717 --> 07:15.947
Oh, I've been on a long journey.

07:18.357 --> 07:21.269
It's the Ring, isn't it?
Bilbo's funny magic ring.

07:21.397 --> 07:24.195
You always used to look like that
when you talked about it.

07:24.277 --> 07:28.668
Bilbo's "funny" ring,
that makes you invisible?

07:30.117 --> 07:32.711
- Give it to me, Frodo!
- Give you the Ring?

07:32.917 --> 07:34.509
For a moment only.

07:40.197 --> 07:42.427
Can you see any markings on it?

07:44.917 --> 07:47.875
There are none.
It's quite a plain ring, really.

07:48.437 --> 07:50.234
Well, then, look!

07:52.517 --> 07:56.192
Wait. Do you desire it so much already?

07:57.517 --> 08:00.077
No, but why ruin it?

08:00.677 --> 08:03.635
Because it is altogether evil.

08:04.637 --> 08:08.107
It will corrupt and destroy
anyone who wears it...

08:08.677 --> 08:11.555
...until he passes
into the World of Shadows...

08:11.717 --> 08:13.753
...under the power of Sauron:

08:14.317 --> 08:17.229
The Dark Lord of Mordor!

08:18.677 --> 08:19.951
Not Bilbo?

08:21.357 --> 08:24.793
You are the one who has the Ring now.

08:36.996 --> 08:39.465
- It's not even warm.
- No.

08:40.197 --> 08:43.269
Not even a dragon's fire
could harm that Ring.

08:51.557 --> 08:54.117
"One Ring to rule them all

08:55.357 --> 08:57.996
"One Ring to find them

08:58.077 --> 09:03.390
"One Ring to bring them all
and in the darkness bind them"

09:03.957 --> 09:06.471
I wish it need not have happened
in my time.

09:07.117 --> 09:08.266
So do I.

09:09.477 --> 09:13.231
The Enemy still lacks one thing
to give him strength of knowledge...

09:13.557 --> 09:17.072
...to break all resistance,
and cover all the lands in darkness.

09:17.837 --> 09:20.146
He lacks the One Ring.

09:20.837 --> 09:22.953
Maybe he doesn't know that it was found.

09:23.037 --> 09:24.595
He knows, Frodo.

09:25.157 --> 09:27.591
Gollum left his cave
to follow the Ring himself...

09:27.677 --> 09:30.145
...and the Dark Lord caught him in Mordor.

09:30.517 --> 09:34.795
The Dark Lord knows what ring it was
Gollum found, and how he lost it again.

09:35.437 --> 09:39.635
And he has heard of Hobbits at last,
and of the Shire.

09:40.917 --> 09:43.351
And he even has a name to think about...

09:44.517 --> 09:46.508
...the name of Baggins.

09:52.317 --> 09:53.909
Because of Gollum!

09:54.517 --> 09:56.587
Oh, Gandalf, what am I to do?

09:57.837 --> 10:02.194
What a pity that Bilbo didn't kill
that vile creature when he had the chance!

10:02.357 --> 10:05.110
Yes, it was pity.

10:05.557 --> 10:07.673
Pity and mercy.

10:08.477 --> 10:12.948
And now, Frodo, the decision lies with you.

10:14.997 --> 10:18.034
What will you do with the One Ring?

10:20.797 --> 10:22.833
I'll give it to you, Gandalf!

10:23.397 --> 10:26.275
You're wise and powerful.
Well, will you not...

10:26.357 --> 10:28.268
No! Do not tempt me.

10:29.517 --> 10:32.714
I would wish to turn it to good,
and it cannot be used so.

10:32.797 --> 10:36.506
Meaning to be kind, I would become
as terrible as the Dark Lord himself.

10:36.597 --> 10:38.667
Do not tempt me!

10:38.957 --> 10:42.996
I shall have such need of strength so soon.

10:47.757 --> 10:50.749
Then I suppose I must keep the Ring
and guard it.

10:52.317 --> 10:54.785
I ought to go away somewhere, alone.

10:54.997 --> 10:59.309
But they won't bother the Shire
if the Ring isn't here.

11:02.517 --> 11:04.269
My dear Frodo...

11:06.157 --> 11:08.034
...I am afraid you are right.

11:08.517 --> 11:12.066
You'll have to go and leave the name
of Baggins behind you.

11:12.757 --> 11:14.827
That name is no longer safe.

11:16.917 --> 11:19.636
Your new traveling name shall be:

11:21.997 --> 11:24.636
Mr. Underhill.

11:30.797 --> 11:32.992
What have you heard,
and why did you listen?

11:33.077 --> 11:35.272
Mr. Frodo, sir, don't let him hurt me, sir!

11:35.357 --> 11:37.951
Don't let him turn me
into anything unnatural.

11:38.157 --> 11:39.192
Well?

11:39.277 --> 11:40.630
Answer him, Sam.

11:40.757 --> 11:43.476
Well, I heard a deal
that I didn't rightly understand...

11:43.557 --> 11:46.833
...about an enemy and rings,
and about Elves, sir.

11:47.917 --> 11:50.875
Why, I would dearly love to see Elves,
Mr. Frodo.

11:51.797 --> 11:53.549
And so you shall, Sam.

11:54.357 --> 11:59.590
So you shall. Indeed, you should go
to the Elves first, to Rivendell.

11:59.957 --> 12:01.754
Tell everyone you are moving away...

12:01.837 --> 12:06.115
...to live in Buckleberry, with those cousins
of yours, Pippin and Merry.

12:06.197 --> 12:10.509
However you manage it, do it soon,
by your birthday at the latest.

12:11.237 --> 12:12.909
I should be back by then.

12:13.077 --> 12:15.750
I must go south,
to consult with the Wizard Saruman...

12:15.837 --> 12:18.988
...the head of my order. Be careful, Frodo.

12:23.357 --> 12:26.030
Me, go, sir? Me, go and see the Elves?

12:26.117 --> 12:29.189
Oh, my! Hooray!

13:01.717 --> 13:04.993
I have come for your aid,
Saruman the White, in troubled times.

13:05.077 --> 13:08.990
The Nine are abroad.
Darkness approaches, the Black Riders!

13:09.077 --> 13:11.796
Is that all the news you have for me then?

13:12.317 --> 13:13.466
Is that not enough?

13:13.557 --> 13:15.673
Sauron is moving at last!

13:16.917 --> 13:20.034
We can deal with Sauron ourselves.

13:20.437 --> 13:25.033
You and I, one way or another.

13:26.877 --> 13:30.506
What talk is this?
What are you saying, Saruman?

13:31.157 --> 13:33.625
It is time for us to choose.

13:33.717 --> 13:37.869
A new age is upon us.
A new power is rising.

13:38.917 --> 13:42.830
Nothing that Men or Elves or Wizards
can do will avail against it.

13:43.637 --> 13:47.471
Its enemies are utterly doomed,
but its friends...

13:49.717 --> 13:53.266
You are saying
that we should join with Mordor?

13:53.557 --> 13:55.115
With him?

13:55.757 --> 13:57.634
Does that displease you?

13:57.877 --> 13:59.549
Where is the Ring, Gandalf?

13:59.637 --> 14:02.595
Why do the Black Riders
search for it in the Shire?

14:02.677 --> 14:04.349
Have you hidden it there?

14:04.437 --> 14:07.156
Would you rather see
the Dark Lord have it...

14:07.477 --> 14:10.196
...or Saruman of many colors?

14:12.397 --> 14:15.036
Neither of you will have it.

14:17.597 --> 14:20.873
There is a third choice.

14:26.277 --> 14:28.632
It is to remain here...

14:28.717 --> 14:32.790
...until you tell me
where the Ring may be found.

14:32.917 --> 14:34.873
Saruman, if you do this...

14:34.957 --> 14:38.632
...if you delay me here,
Sauron will surely get it then.

14:42.357 --> 14:45.269
Then he will know his good servants...

14:47.677 --> 14:49.872
...and his enemies.

14:54.597 --> 14:56.269
Saruman!

15:00.597 --> 15:02.189
Saruman!

15:09.157 --> 15:12.069
I don't feel right going off without Gandalf,
Mr. Frodo.

15:12.157 --> 15:14.068
I wish we could've waited, that I do.

15:14.157 --> 15:17.229
So do I, Sam,
but he said to leave as soon as we could.

15:17.357 --> 15:21.794
And Merry and Pippin insisted on coming
with us, as far as Bree, for the fun of it.

15:41.157 --> 15:44.467
There's someone coming up ahead,
Mr. Frodo. I can hear a horse.

15:44.557 --> 15:48.232
Good. I'm tired of looking
at my cousins all day.

15:48.317 --> 15:52.469
I think we should get off the road.
I don't want to be seen leaving the Shire.

15:52.557 --> 15:53.956
But it might be Gandalf.

15:54.037 --> 15:56.597
Then we'll surprise him. Hurry!

18:13.957 --> 18:15.709
We're going with you, Frodo.

18:15.797 --> 18:16.946
With me?

18:17.037 --> 18:19.392
But how do you... Sam.

18:20.157 --> 18:23.866
- But you gave your word.
- They already knew so much, Mr. Frodo.

18:24.117 --> 18:26.677
Sam didn't tell us about the Ring, Frodo.

18:26.877 --> 18:31.553
I saw Bilbo use it once, before he left,
to hide from the Sackville-Bagginses.

18:31.677 --> 18:34.350
And after that,
Pippin and I kept on the lookout...

18:34.437 --> 18:37.076
...and we followed you.
We asked questions everywhere.

18:37.157 --> 18:39.625
And we even wormed
a few things out of Gandalf.

18:39.717 --> 18:42.356
And you spied on me.
And Sam helped you.

18:42.757 --> 18:44.031
And we spied on you.

18:44.117 --> 18:46.392
But we meant no wrong to you, Mr. Frodo.

18:46.477 --> 18:48.513
Don't you remember
what Mr. Gandalf said?

18:48.597 --> 18:50.713
"Take someone you can trust," he said.

18:50.797 --> 18:54.551
- It doesn't seem that I can trust anyone.
- It all depends on what you want.

18:54.637 --> 18:58.550
You can trust us to stick to you
through thick and thin, to the bitter end.

18:58.637 --> 19:01.310
But you cannot trust us
to let you face trouble alone...

19:01.397 --> 19:04.628
...and go off without a word.
We're your friends, Frodo.

19:13.757 --> 19:16.191
Bless you, you deceitful scoundrels.

19:16.277 --> 19:17.676
Hooray!

19:20.037 --> 19:22.870
Will we be stopping at Bree tonight,
Mr. Frodo?

19:22.957 --> 19:24.106
I think so, Sam.

19:24.197 --> 19:28.270
We all need a fireside and a bath,
and a proper night's sleep in a real bed.

19:28.397 --> 19:30.388
I do wish Gandalf were with us.

19:30.477 --> 19:32.866
Maybe he'll be at the inn
when we get there.

19:32.957 --> 19:34.072
Maybe.

20:26.077 --> 20:28.352
I think I'll go out for a sniff of air.

20:28.437 --> 20:33.147
Mind yourselves. Don't forget:
You're supposed to be escaping in secret.

20:33.237 --> 20:35.910
Oh, mind yourself! Don't get lost.

20:36.077 --> 20:37.669
Be careful, Merry.

20:40.797 --> 20:41.912
Quiet!

20:42.037 --> 20:43.265
Quiet, all!

20:43.357 --> 20:47.669
We have some visitors with us tonight,
all the way from the Shire.

20:50.877 --> 20:52.629
What was your name again, sir?

20:52.717 --> 20:54.947
Mr. Underhill.

20:55.197 --> 20:58.314
Mr. Underhill and his party.

21:05.277 --> 21:08.633
Yes, Mr. Underhill, sing us a Shire song!

21:09.357 --> 21:12.235
Well, a short one, then.

21:19.397 --> 21:23.515
"There is an inn, a merry old inn
Beneath an old gray hill

21:23.637 --> 21:26.276
"And there they brew a beer so brown

21:31.197 --> 21:33.267
"With a fol-de-doo and a fol-de-da

21:33.397 --> 21:35.467
"Hobbits all of the Shire are we"

21:45.477 --> 21:46.705
Who's there?

21:47.517 --> 21:48.836
Who's there?

21:56.237 --> 21:59.115
"With a ping and a pang
The fiddle-strings broke

21:59.197 --> 22:01.586
"The cow jumped over the Moon"

22:24.797 --> 22:26.230
Where did he go?

22:31.197 --> 22:32.630
What's going on here?

22:32.717 --> 22:34.787
Take your magic tricks back to the Shire!

22:34.877 --> 22:37.471
What's this place coming to,
I'd like to know?

22:43.357 --> 22:45.188
Well, Mr. Underhill...

22:45.277 --> 22:49.953
...frightening my customers and breaking
my crocks with your acrobatics!

22:50.077 --> 22:54.593
Very sorry, it's quite unintentional,
a most unfortunate accident.

23:14.237 --> 23:16.956
Well, you have put your foot in it this time.

23:17.237 --> 23:18.306
Who are you?

23:18.397 --> 23:20.194
I am called Strider.

23:20.957 --> 23:23.835
- Everyone knows me here.
- Well, we don't!

23:24.477 --> 23:27.674
You've been very careless so far,
Mr. Frodo Baggins.

23:27.997 --> 23:29.953
My name is Mr. Underhill.

23:30.997 --> 23:34.467
After your performance tonight,
it won't matter what you're called.

23:34.557 --> 23:37.117
The Black Riders will know
who you are by morning.

23:37.197 --> 23:39.108
They already know what you bear.

23:39.197 --> 23:40.835
Who are you really?

23:40.997 --> 23:44.831
I am Gandalf's friend.
He asked me to watch out for you.

23:45.117 --> 23:47.711
Gandalf? Have you seen him?
Where is he?

23:47.797 --> 23:49.230
I do not know.

23:50.397 --> 23:54.788
We were supposed to meet him here,
but I've had no word, no message.

23:55.437 --> 23:58.315
It is the first time
that I've ever feared for him.

23:59.717 --> 24:02.311
Then we will have to go on
by ourselves tomorrow.

24:02.397 --> 24:03.671
To Rivendell?

24:03.757 --> 24:07.511
You'd never get there. The Black Riders
are watching the road night and day.

24:07.597 --> 24:11.272
They will come on you in the wild,
in some dark place, where there's no help.

24:11.357 --> 24:13.268
I know the wild country.

24:13.717 --> 24:17.073
I can take you to Rivendell
by paths that are seldom trodden.

24:17.997 --> 24:19.146
Will you have me?

24:19.237 --> 24:21.751
With your leave, Mr. Frodo, I'd say no.

24:21.877 --> 24:25.472
This Strider, he says be more careful,
I say, let's start with him.

24:25.557 --> 24:27.548
How do we know he's from Gandalf?

24:27.637 --> 24:31.186
More likely, he's a playacting spy,
working for...

24:31.597 --> 24:34.350
- For them.
- I don't know, Sam.

24:34.877 --> 24:37.471
I think one of the Enemy's servants
would, well...

24:37.557 --> 24:40.629
...seem fairer and feel fouler,
if you understand.

24:42.477 --> 24:45.435
While I look foul and feel fair, is that it?

24:45.757 --> 24:47.554
Well, no, I meant...

24:47.917 --> 24:48.952
Frodo!

24:49.437 --> 24:52.713
Frodo, I've seen them!
I've seen them, Frodo!

24:53.197 --> 24:55.757
I've seen them! Black Riders!

24:55.877 --> 24:57.833
My men found him lying in the street.

24:57.917 --> 24:59.350
There were two of them.

24:59.437 --> 25:03.146
They were hissing to each other.
I seemed to be drawn towards them.

25:03.277 --> 25:06.075
Well, you do need looking after, all of you.

25:06.317 --> 25:09.229
There's been strange folk about for days.

25:10.277 --> 25:11.835
That Ranger...

25:12.197 --> 25:15.951
...Strider coming and going and... Strider!

25:17.197 --> 25:19.995
- They've come from Mordor.
- Save us!

25:20.077 --> 25:22.272
They won't trouble you once I am gone.

25:22.357 --> 25:24.666
Strider came to offer me his help.

25:26.237 --> 25:28.353
You know your own business, maybe...

25:28.797 --> 25:33.154
...but in your place, I wouldn't take up
with a ranger out of the wild.

25:33.237 --> 25:35.034
They have no choice.

25:35.277 --> 25:37.916
There is no one else for them
except a fat innkeeper...

25:37.997 --> 25:41.785
...who only remembers his name
because people shout it at him all day!

25:42.237 --> 25:46.594
I'll do what I can to help, Mr. Baggins.
Mr. Underhill.

25:47.357 --> 25:49.712
I'm no hero, but I'll do what I can.

25:49.797 --> 25:53.028
Keep watch tonight, you and your folk.

25:57.477 --> 26:00.150
There is a hill called Weathertop...

26:00.397 --> 26:03.116
...about half way between here
and Rivendell.

26:03.837 --> 26:07.273
We will make for it tomorrow.
So will Gandalf, if he can.

26:08.957 --> 26:11.994
I still don't know if we can trust him,
Mr. Frodo.

26:12.317 --> 26:14.911
I said, you have no choice, Sam.

26:15.877 --> 26:18.437
Because, if I wanted the Ring for myself...

26:18.637 --> 26:21.105
...I could have it, now.

26:28.717 --> 26:31.914
My name is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

26:34.957 --> 26:38.552
If by life or death I can save you, I will.

29:35.157 --> 29:37.751
How long will we be
in these marshes, Aragorn?

29:37.837 --> 29:39.429
At least two days.

29:40.077 --> 29:42.227
I'm being eaten alive!

29:42.717 --> 29:45.675
What do these things live on
when they can't get Hobbits?

29:45.757 --> 29:48.874
Easy there, Bill, easy, slow.

30:19.357 --> 30:20.756
That is Weathertop.

30:20.837 --> 30:24.591
We shall be there by nightfall, if we set
a good pace and don't stop for lunch.

30:24.677 --> 30:26.668
If this continues I'll become a wraith.

30:26.757 --> 30:28.509
Don't speak of such things.

30:35.917 --> 30:37.748
Aragorn! Aragorn!

30:49.437 --> 30:51.871
And Beren was a mortal man...

30:52.197 --> 30:56.190
...but Luthien Tinúviel
was the daughter of a king of Elves...

30:56.637 --> 31:01.153
...and she was the fairest maiden that has
been among all the children of this world.

31:01.237 --> 31:04.354
Yet she chose to be mortal, for him.

31:04.997 --> 31:07.465
And when he died, she followed him.

31:07.957 --> 31:10.312
And so he was her doom...

31:10.477 --> 31:12.513
...but he was her love as well.

31:14.997 --> 31:16.953
I thought I saw something!

31:18.397 --> 31:21.548
Or maybe just shadows in the moonlight,
I don't know.

31:24.597 --> 31:27.748
Just stand close to the fire. Make a circle.

31:33.117 --> 31:34.391
What's that?

33:02.717 --> 33:05.595
The Ring, Frodo! Take off the Ring!

33:43.037 --> 33:45.756
Cold... It's so cold.

33:46.917 --> 33:50.353
- Like a poisoned icicle.
- It is the cold of their world, Frodo.

33:50.517 --> 33:54.032
When you put on the Ring,
you entered the world of the Black Riders.

33:54.117 --> 33:55.835
Gandalf said not to.

33:57.037 --> 34:00.109
Why is it so misty here?
I can't see very well.

34:00.197 --> 34:03.792
Well, what's the matter with him?
It was only a little wound.

34:04.277 --> 34:06.950
It was an evil knife that struck him, Sam.

34:07.277 --> 34:11.190
I think that a piece broke off in the wound
and is working inward.

34:11.516 --> 34:13.428
If it reaches his heart...

34:15.237 --> 34:16.955
Can you do anything?

34:17.556 --> 34:19.866
We must get to Rivendell very soon.

34:23.437 --> 34:25.268
He can't go no further.

34:25.437 --> 34:27.905
He must! Do you want them to take him?

34:28.397 --> 34:29.989
Wait, listen.

34:45.917 --> 34:47.509
Legolas!

34:58.957 --> 35:01.915
Yes, Sam, that's an elf.

35:08.477 --> 35:12.516
So, there has been no word of Gandalf
in Rivendell? No message at all?

35:12.757 --> 35:13.792
None.

35:14.037 --> 35:17.507
My Lord Elrond has sent every rider
he could spare to seek for you...

35:17.597 --> 35:20.748
...knowing that you bore a great burden
without guidance.

35:20.957 --> 35:23.232
I have been on the road for nine days.

35:23.757 --> 35:26.954
Well, Mr. Frodo has been on the road
a lot longer than that.

35:27.037 --> 35:29.312
And he's sick and he needs a rest.

35:30.797 --> 35:32.276
Just for a while.

35:34.237 --> 35:37.547
No resting can help your Mr. Frodo now.

35:37.637 --> 35:41.107
Only the hands of Elrond in Rivendell
can do that.

35:41.197 --> 35:43.836
There are five Black Riders
close behind us...

35:44.077 --> 35:47.308
...and we may well find
the other four waiting at the ford.

35:47.517 --> 35:50.873
If we lose even a little time,
we lose, Frodo, the Ring...

35:51.277 --> 35:53.108
...and Middle-earth.

35:54.117 --> 35:56.073
Do you understand me, Sam?

36:06.037 --> 36:08.232
There is the ford of Rivendell.

36:29.757 --> 36:31.509
Fly! The Enemy is upon us!

37:24.157 --> 37:28.309
Come back. To Mordor we will take you.

38:03.757 --> 38:05.588
Gandalf!

38:32.517 --> 38:36.066
Come back, come back.
To Mordor we'll take you.

38:36.477 --> 38:40.311
Come back, come back.
To Mordor, we'll take you.

38:49.917 --> 38:51.066
Go back!

38:59.717 --> 39:01.753
Run, you fool, run!

40:22.237 --> 40:23.465
The Ring!

40:24.077 --> 40:25.271
The Ring!

40:26.557 --> 40:30.152
Go back to the land of Mordor,
and follow me no more.

40:30.637 --> 40:33.913
Come back. Come back.

40:34.237 --> 40:37.309
To Mordor we will take you.

40:37.677 --> 40:40.794
Come back. Come back.

40:42.277 --> 40:43.835
Go back!

40:45.597 --> 40:46.825
The Ring.

40:47.517 --> 40:49.075
The Ring!

40:52.757 --> 40:56.955
By all the Shire,
you shall have neither the Ring nor me!

42:14.117 --> 42:17.996
No, never. Verily, I come.

42:18.717 --> 42:20.150
I give it unto you.

42:20.437 --> 42:22.473
No, never! Gandalf!

42:22.797 --> 42:23.673
Yes.

42:24.797 --> 42:28.107
I am here,
and you are lucky to be here, too...

42:28.197 --> 42:31.348
...after all the absurd things you've done
since you left home.

42:31.437 --> 42:33.553
Where's Sam?
And are the others all right?

42:33.637 --> 42:36.105
They've hardly left your side for three days.

42:36.197 --> 42:37.266
Three days?

42:37.397 --> 42:40.707
What happened at the ford?
It all seemed so dim, somehow.

42:41.837 --> 42:44.556
You were beginning to fade,
my remarkable friend.

42:45.117 --> 42:48.109
The knifepoint had almost
worked its way to your heart.

42:48.797 --> 42:51.231
Oh, I didn't know. Would I have...

42:51.917 --> 42:53.873
You would have become like them.

42:54.877 --> 42:56.549
One of the Ringwraiths...

42:59.157 --> 43:01.227
...the servants of the Dark Lord...

43:01.637 --> 43:03.912
...if you had not resisted to the last.

43:04.317 --> 43:06.512
The river, it rose up against them.

43:06.717 --> 43:07.945
It is Elrond's river.

43:08.037 --> 43:11.268
This is his house
and it was Elrond himself who healed you.

43:11.877 --> 43:15.586
If I may say so,
I added a few touches of my own.

43:16.797 --> 43:19.436
The white horses and so on.
If you noticed.

43:19.557 --> 43:21.787
Then that is the end of the Black Riders?

43:21.877 --> 43:24.232
Not so long as the Ring itself exists.

43:25.597 --> 43:29.351
They will fly back to their master
in Mordor, empty and crippled...

43:29.637 --> 43:33.516
...until they find new shapes to wear
and new beasts to ride.

43:34.157 --> 43:36.671
We have beaten them,
just for a while, Frodo.

43:37.277 --> 43:38.915
That's sort of a relief.

43:39.197 --> 43:41.153
I wish that were the truth, Frodo.

43:41.237 --> 43:44.388
I'm afraid we have a new
and closer problem at hand.

43:45.237 --> 43:48.786
You have not asked me
why I was late getting back to the Shire.

43:48.877 --> 43:49.866
I forgot.

43:50.637 --> 43:53.754
When I was certain that yours was indeed
the Master Ring...

43:54.157 --> 43:58.036
<i>... I rode at once to Isengard</i>,
<i>and I thought...</i>

43:58.877 --> 44:02.153
<i>... that if anyone could know</i>
<i>what was best to do with the One Ring...</i>

44:02.237 --> 44:05.195
<i>... it would surely be Saruman the White.</i>

44:09.317 --> 44:10.955
<i>The great eagle</i>, <i>Gwaihir...</i>

44:11.037 --> 44:14.188
<i>... came in answer to my call</i>,
<i>and bore me away.</i>

44:16.477 --> 44:19.913
<i>Saruman has never paid enough</i>
<i>attention to animals.</i>

44:21.197 --> 44:25.509
- But if he should seize the Ring...
- He will become master of all Middle-earth.

44:28.477 --> 44:31.196
The War of the Ring has begun, Frodo.

44:32.077 --> 44:35.831
You will hear the rest in Council
when you are well enough. Rest now.

44:43.077 --> 44:47.070
"The leaves were long, the grass was green

44:48.157 --> 44:51.035
"But the hemlock-umbels tall and fair

44:56.757 --> 44:59.476
"And in the glade a light was seen

44:59.557 --> 45:01.548
"Of stars in shadow, shimmering

45:03.077 --> 45:05.545
"Tinúviel was dancing there"

45:05.917 --> 45:07.032
Bilbo!

45:13.637 --> 45:14.956
Hello, Frodo, my lad.

45:15.037 --> 45:17.870
Where have you been?
Why haven't I seen you before?

45:17.957 --> 45:22.269
I've seen a good deal of you,
sitting by your side with Sam each day.

45:22.357 --> 45:25.554
Bilbo, have you been here all the time?
All these years?

45:26.197 --> 45:30.076
There didn't seem much reason
to be anywhere else, after all.

45:31.077 --> 45:35.787
The food's very good,
and I listen, and I think.

45:36.917 --> 45:38.828
A remarkable place altogether.

45:39.477 --> 45:40.307
Yes.

45:43.357 --> 45:47.032
And now, of course, there's all this bustle
about that ring of mine.

45:47.372 --> 45:51.411
Fancy the little thing causing
such a disturbance. Have you got it here?

45:52.212 --> 45:53.770
Yes, I have.

45:55.292 --> 45:58.807
I'd very much like just to peep at it again,
just for a moment.

46:16.092 --> 46:17.207
Put it away.

46:20.492 --> 46:21.845
I understand now.

46:24.212 --> 46:25.327
I'm sorry.

46:26.572 --> 46:30.201
Sorry about everything.

46:32.252 --> 46:35.244
Don't adventures...

46:36.972 --> 46:38.928
...ever have an end?

46:43.532 --> 46:46.729
The Council of Elrond is beginning.
Come with me.

46:47.372 --> 46:48.487
Both of you.

46:54.292 --> 46:58.922
<i>All that morning</i>, <i>the Council of Elrond</i>
<i>debated the history of the One Ring...</i>

46:59.132 --> 47:00.963
<i>... and its master</i>, <i>Sauron.</i>

47:01.212 --> 47:03.726
<i>Gandalf also told all present of Saruman...</i>

47:04.012 --> 47:06.970
<i>... the traitor</i>, <i>and his desire</i>
<i>for the power of the Ring.</i>

47:07.052 --> 47:10.328
<i>Elves and Dwarves</i>, <i>in their turn</i>,
<i>told what they knew of Sauron's...</i>

47:10.412 --> 47:13.802
<i>... preparations for conquest</i>,
<i>and so did Boromir of Gondor.</i>

47:15.052 --> 47:18.488
In Gondor, we are already under attack
by the forces of Mordor.

47:18.932 --> 47:20.968
I am Boromir. In a dream...

47:21.252 --> 47:23.641
...I heard a voice crying to me, saying:

47:23.892 --> 47:26.122
"Seek for the sword that was broken."

47:27.212 --> 47:29.521
Here is the sword of Elendil of Gondor...

47:29.612 --> 47:32.285
...who fought the Dark Lord long ago
and was slain.

47:32.372 --> 47:34.203
<i>So</i>, <i>Frodo learned at last...</i>

47:34.532 --> 47:37.649
<i>... the true heritage of Aragorn</i>,
<i>the son of Arathorn...</i>

47:37.892 --> 47:42.044
<i>... descendent of Isildur</i>,
<i>who cut the One Ring from Sauron's hand.</i>

47:42.572 --> 47:45.530
Then it belongs to you,
and not to me at all?

47:47.452 --> 47:49.204
Bring out the Ring, Frodo.

47:50.092 --> 47:51.491
The time has come.

47:54.092 --> 47:55.411
Isildur's Bane.

47:55.972 --> 47:57.166
The Halfling.

47:57.932 --> 48:01.288
What shall we do with it then,
this mightiest of all weapons?

48:01.452 --> 48:04.171
We cannot keep it, we cannot destroy it.

48:04.972 --> 48:07.532
Sauron, who forged it looks for his Ring...

48:07.852 --> 48:11.128
...and Saruman who envies it,
searches for its power, too.

48:13.612 --> 48:16.331
I see no other road for us
but the most fearful:

48:16.812 --> 48:18.291
The road into Mordor.

48:18.412 --> 48:21.324
We must send the Ring to the fire
where it was made:

48:21.732 --> 48:23.051
To Mount Doom.

48:23.372 --> 48:25.010
What foolishness is this?

48:25.132 --> 48:27.566
Why do you speak of hiding
and destroying?

48:27.732 --> 48:29.927
The Ring could save all Middle-earth.

48:30.012 --> 48:31.604
Have you heard nothing?

48:31.692 --> 48:35.002
It is Sauron's Ring. To wield it...

48:35.572 --> 48:37.608
...you would have to become Sauron.

48:37.692 --> 48:39.808
I will not touch it!

48:41.132 --> 48:42.201
Nor I.

48:43.172 --> 48:46.209
Our one hope lies in foolishness, Boromir.

48:47.252 --> 48:50.927
The Dark Lord cannot conceive
of anyone wishing to destroy his Ring.

48:51.372 --> 48:55.126
He will wait until one of us tries to use it...

48:55.412 --> 48:57.323
...follow every move we make.

48:58.412 --> 49:02.246
And it is just possible
that he may not notice...

49:02.372 --> 49:06.331
...the small, quiet feet, walking into peril...

49:07.372 --> 49:08.646
...into Mordor.

49:11.172 --> 49:14.881
Very well. It's plain enough
what you're pointing at.

49:15.532 --> 49:20.287
Bilbo, the silly Hobbit, started this affair,
and had better finish it, or himself.

49:20.692 --> 49:22.364
When ought I to start?

49:23.292 --> 49:25.328
It has passed beyond you, Bilbo.

49:26.172 --> 49:28.686
This last journey
must be for others to make.

49:31.452 --> 49:32.771
Who are they to be?

49:32.852 --> 49:35.366
That is what they're trying to decide here.

49:38.572 --> 49:41.405
I will take the Ring...

49:42.572 --> 49:44.528
...though I do not know the way.

49:45.452 --> 49:48.603
I think that this task
is appointed for you, Frodo.

49:49.572 --> 49:52.325
This is the hour of the Shire-folk, at last.

49:53.212 --> 49:55.646
But you won't send him off alone, surely?

49:57.172 --> 49:59.891
You, at least, shall go with him,
Master Samwise.

50:01.132 --> 50:05.523
It is impossible to separate you,
even when he is summoned to a Council...

50:05.612 --> 50:07.045
...and you are not.

50:09.372 --> 50:12.603
A nice pickle
we've landed ourselves in, Mr. Frodo.

50:16.892 --> 50:20.043
I thought perhaps
you might care to have these.

50:20.412 --> 50:23.848
Bilbo, I don't think I should look right.

50:24.852 --> 50:27.525
You can wear the shirt under your clothes.

50:28.332 --> 50:32.325
It's as light as anything.
But I fancy it might turn...

50:32.452 --> 50:34.727
...even the knives of the Black Riders.

50:40.732 --> 50:43.849
I named the sword Sting, long ago.

50:45.092 --> 50:47.845
It's silly, but there you are.

50:48.332 --> 50:50.687
It shines when there are enemies about.

50:52.252 --> 50:53.765
Orcs and things.

50:55.972 --> 51:00.488
There. Now you look
just a plain Hobbit on the surface...

51:03.892 --> 51:06.406
Well, take care.

51:08.492 --> 51:11.006
Bring back any old songs
and tales you hear.

51:17.292 --> 51:20.489
"I sit beside the fire

51:21.452 --> 51:23.886
"And think of all that I have seen"

51:25.892 --> 51:28.247
<i>Our only hope is in speed and secrecy.</i>

51:29.332 --> 51:31.402
<i>The Company of the Ring shall be nine.</i>

51:31.492 --> 51:34.404
<i>Nine walkers against</i>
<i>the nine Riders of Mordor.</i>

51:37.092 --> 51:39.447
<i>With Sam and Frodo</i>, <i>Gandalf will go.</i>

51:40.612 --> 51:42.330
<i>For the other Free Peoples...</i>

51:42.412 --> 51:46.883
<i>... Legolas shall be for the Elves</i>,
<i>and Gimli</i>, <i>son of Glóin</i>, <i>for the Dwarves.</i>

51:49.132 --> 51:50.804
<i>For Men shall go the valiant...</i>

51:50.892 --> 51:54.601
<i>... Boromir of Gondor</i>,
<i>and Aragorn</i>, <i>son of Arathorn.</i>

51:56.092 --> 51:59.164
<i>And for the last two places</i>,
<i>we will trust to friendship...</i>

51:59.252 --> 52:01.846
<i>... rather than to great wisdom</i>,
<i>Peregrin Took...</i>

52:01.932 --> 52:04.446
<i>... and Meriadoc Brandybuck may also go.</i>

52:11.252 --> 52:14.722
When did you ever know such a storm,
so far south?

52:15.452 --> 52:18.808
The Dark Lord's arm has grown long
if he can hurl snow at us...

52:18.892 --> 52:20.610
...all the way from Mordor.

52:21.692 --> 52:24.001
His arm has grown long.

52:38.412 --> 52:41.131
No, Gandalf, not that dark way, I beg you!

52:41.292 --> 52:42.884
And what would you suggest?

52:42.972 --> 52:47.045
Returning to Rivendell to wait there
for the end? We have no choice, Aragorn!

52:47.132 --> 52:49.088
We might go by way of the Gap of Rohan.

52:49.172 --> 52:53.290
That'd take the Ring too close to Isengard
and Saruman. We dare not risk it.

52:53.612 --> 52:55.921
Yet you would risk the mines of Moria.

52:56.012 --> 52:59.846
Where both you and I have walked before
and come out again alive.

53:00.732 --> 53:02.370
The memory is very evil.

53:03.412 --> 53:05.880
I do not wish to enter Moria a second time.

53:05.972 --> 53:08.122
And I don't wish to enter it even once.

53:08.212 --> 53:09.167
Nor me.

53:09.452 --> 53:13.365
The question is not who wishes to go,
but who will?

53:14.012 --> 53:16.606
There is no other way
to pass the mountains.

53:19.812 --> 53:21.450
I will go with you.

53:22.132 --> 53:25.886
My cousin Balin led a company
of Dwarves there, many years ago.

53:26.292 --> 53:29.045
There has been no word of them
in all that time.

53:29.532 --> 53:31.841
Elves do not walk in the dark earth.

53:32.452 --> 53:35.205
I will go, but I fear for you, Gandalf.

53:35.372 --> 53:39.445
I will not go, not unless the vote
of the whole company is against me.

53:42.012 --> 53:44.003
What does the Ring-bearer say?

53:45.292 --> 53:46.850
I do not wish to go.

53:51.372 --> 53:54.011
But I will go, if Gandalf advises it.

54:08.052 --> 54:12.568
Steady, easy, Bill. Old Gandalf
will have that gate open in a minute.

54:12.852 --> 54:16.527
- What if he can't?
- I've never seen anything he couldn't do.

54:17.132 --> 54:17.962
Sam!

54:18.372 --> 54:21.205
Fireworks are all very nice,
but this is elf magic.

54:32.172 --> 54:34.891
What a people you Dwarves are
for hiding things.

54:35.212 --> 54:38.648
On the gates of your most wondrous,
ancient kingdom you write:

54:38.732 --> 54:42.771
"Speak, friend, and enter," and no spell
in any language can open the door.

54:47.532 --> 54:50.000
Why do you keep looking
at the lake, Frodo?

54:51.692 --> 54:53.011
I'm afraid of it.

54:56.572 --> 54:59.644
And there sits our quest.
If we had to bring a wizard at all...

54:59.732 --> 55:01.450
...it should have been Saruman.

55:01.532 --> 55:02.726
Be still, Boromir.

55:02.812 --> 55:05.724
Why? There are other ways to turn,
if our Wizard's balked.

55:05.812 --> 55:07.723
I said, from the beginning...

55:10.332 --> 55:12.971
Gandalf, you old fool!

55:32.972 --> 55:37.011
So, all you had to do
was say, "friend," and enter.

55:37.892 --> 55:40.008
Those were happier times.

55:41.972 --> 55:43.246
Let us go.

56:03.372 --> 56:05.602
I'm coming, Mr. Frodo! I'm coming!

56:19.012 --> 56:20.923
Into the gateway! All of you!

56:27.932 --> 56:31.402
Poor old Bill!

56:37.452 --> 56:40.922
Gandalf, what was the thing in the water?

56:41.452 --> 56:42.726
I do not know.

56:43.852 --> 56:47.925
There are older and fouler things than Orcs
in the deep places of the world.

56:48.292 --> 56:51.204
Whatever it was, it grabbed Frodo first,
out of all of us.

56:51.292 --> 56:52.850
Be quiet, Pippin!

56:59.692 --> 57:01.762
We have gone far enough for today.

57:02.892 --> 57:04.803
Let us stop here for the night.

57:44.172 --> 57:46.083
Seems to have been a guardroom.

57:46.692 --> 57:49.126
Yes, there's even a well.

57:50.412 --> 57:52.767
We had better rest here.

57:56.452 --> 57:58.682
It's hard to believe that even Dwarves...

57:58.772 --> 58:01.491
...could have lived
in this half-drowned dungeon!

58:01.572 --> 58:03.403
It was a great realm once.

58:03.532 --> 58:05.170
Be still! Both of you!

58:09.492 --> 58:11.801
Which way do we take tomorrow, Gandalf?

58:12.332 --> 58:13.765
I have not decided.

58:13.972 --> 58:18.523
The path to the left smells foul,
and I am too weary to choose.

58:19.252 --> 58:22.483
The way ahead feels wrong, somehow.

58:24.052 --> 58:26.327
At least the middle way goes up.

58:26.412 --> 58:28.448
It's time we began to climb again.

58:29.052 --> 58:32.886
Perhaps. I cannot remember.

58:35.332 --> 58:37.687
What's that?

58:40.532 --> 58:43.205
- Pippin!
- Just a stone.

58:43.612 --> 58:45.204
I dropped a stone.

58:45.492 --> 58:48.802
Fool of a Took!
Throw yourself in next time! Be quiet!

58:50.612 --> 58:52.330
Fool of a Pippin!

59:13.892 --> 59:15.325
Yes, this way.

59:15.612 --> 59:18.490
We should find our way down
to the Great Gates by tonight.

59:18.572 --> 59:20.210
I shall be glad.

59:20.772 --> 59:23.605
I doubt now that Dwarves
ever came back here.

59:23.692 --> 59:26.809
Why should they have come back?
What was left for them to mine?

59:26.892 --> 59:31.249
Mithril silver!
The most precious metal in the world.

59:53.452 --> 59:56.046
"Balin, son of Fundin...

59:56.852 --> 59:58.729
"...Lord of Moria."

59:59.572 --> 01:00:01.244
They did come back.

01:00:04.492 --> 01:00:06.767
It seems to be a record of the colony.

01:00:08.172 --> 01:00:11.050
Orc swords. There was a great battle here.

01:00:12.172 --> 01:00:13.127
Yes.

01:00:15.012 --> 01:00:17.685
"Balin is now Lord of Moria."

01:00:18.172 --> 01:00:21.448
Here it says, "We found Mithril."

01:00:22.732 --> 01:00:24.450
Now it says:

01:00:25.772 --> 01:00:29.606
"Yesterday, Balin, Lord of Moria, fell.

01:00:30.452 --> 01:00:32.886
"An Orc shot him from behind a stone.

01:00:35.932 --> 01:00:38.446
"We slew the Orc, but many more..."

01:00:39.052 --> 01:00:41.486
Then it says, "We have barred the gates."

01:00:41.972 --> 01:00:45.647
And something about,
"The Watcher in the Water."

01:00:51.852 --> 01:00:53.683
- What do you hear?
- Nothing.

01:00:55.412 --> 01:00:56.845
But I feel.

01:00:57.292 --> 01:00:58.691
It is grim reading.

01:00:58.812 --> 01:01:01.690
"They have taken the bridge.
They are coming!

01:01:02.572 --> 01:01:07.009
"We cannot get out!
Drums, drums in the deep!"

01:01:09.452 --> 01:01:11.010
There is nothing more.

01:01:11.292 --> 01:01:14.170
Gandalf? I don't want to stay here.

01:01:19.692 --> 01:01:23.048
We are going now, Pippin.
There is nothing more.

01:01:29.012 --> 01:01:30.331
They are coming.

01:01:30.412 --> 01:01:32.289
Slam the doors and wedge them.

01:01:37.092 --> 01:01:39.845
Keep the east door ajar.
We must not get shut in.

01:01:52.732 --> 01:01:56.122
Orcs and something else.
A great Cave-troll, I think.

01:01:56.332 --> 01:01:57.526
Out this way!

01:02:06.892 --> 01:02:07.961
The Shire!

01:02:12.932 --> 01:02:14.126
For the Shire!

01:02:28.732 --> 01:02:31.804
Now is the last chance! Run for it!

01:03:08.212 --> 01:03:10.168
I'm all right. I can walk.

01:03:10.852 --> 01:03:12.490
I thought you were dead.

01:03:16.332 --> 01:03:18.527
All of you, down the stairs!

01:03:35.732 --> 01:03:38.166
Lead the way, Gimli!
Pippin and Merry next.

01:03:38.452 --> 01:03:41.444
Come no closer! I warn you!

01:04:17.732 --> 01:04:18.847
Balrog!

01:04:27.772 --> 01:04:32.004
Fly, all of you!
Fly, up the stairs and straight on.

01:04:32.412 --> 01:04:34.562
Fly! You cannot help me.

01:04:37.972 --> 01:04:39.451
You cannot pass.

01:04:46.452 --> 01:04:48.488
I am a servant of the Secret Fire.

01:04:49.932 --> 01:04:51.206
You cannot pass.

01:04:51.852 --> 01:04:53.410
Go back to the shadow.

01:05:05.052 --> 01:05:07.008
You cannot pass.

01:05:30.972 --> 01:05:32.200
Fly, you fools!

01:05:49.452 --> 01:05:50.885
Come. Follow me.

01:05:52.052 --> 01:05:53.041
Obey him!

01:06:12.652 --> 01:06:15.450
- There may be a bit of a scar, Sam.
- I don't care.

01:06:15.732 --> 01:06:17.290
Now it is your turn, Frodo.

01:06:17.372 --> 01:06:19.567
I'm all right. What does it matter now?

01:06:19.652 --> 01:06:22.485
It matters. We still have a long road,
and much to do.

01:06:22.572 --> 01:06:25.723
Why? We've no hope without Gandalf.
You know that, Aragorn.

01:06:25.812 --> 01:06:28.884
Then we must do without hope.
There is always vengeance.

01:06:32.092 --> 01:06:33.286
Mithril shirt!

01:06:34.252 --> 01:06:35.810
That's what saved you.

01:06:36.292 --> 01:06:38.442
I have never seen one so beautiful.

01:06:38.532 --> 01:06:39.726
- There!
- What is it?

01:06:39.812 --> 01:06:42.246
The footsteps,
I heard them in Moria, following.

01:06:42.332 --> 01:06:44.607
The Orcs will not come after us until dark.

01:06:44.692 --> 01:06:46.330
It never sounds like an orc.

01:06:46.412 --> 01:06:48.209
They're bare feet and they flap.

01:06:48.292 --> 01:06:51.329
Whatever creature it is,
it won't follow us where we're going.

01:06:51.412 --> 01:06:53.368
Nothing evil passes through Lothlorien.

01:06:53.452 --> 01:06:56.842
- That is not what we say in Gondor.
- Then you know nothing in Gondor.

01:06:56.932 --> 01:07:00.766
Out of Moria into the Golden Wood.
Is there no way less perilous?

01:07:01.532 --> 01:07:05.127
I would almost rather face
the Balrog again, than the Lady.

01:07:05.292 --> 01:07:09.490
Lothlorien is a place of healing.
There is no evil in it, unless a man...

01:07:09.572 --> 01:07:12.848
...brings evil there with him.
- Welcome to Lothlorien.

01:07:13.892 --> 01:07:17.202
I am Galadriel
and this is my lord, Celeborn.

01:07:18.892 --> 01:07:21.360
The forests have told us of your loss.

01:07:22.052 --> 01:07:25.203
We sorrow for you,
and for all of Middle-earth.

01:07:25.292 --> 01:07:28.409
Rest here now for a little,
until you are healed.

01:07:28.932 --> 01:07:30.729
Your quest is known to us.

01:07:31.772 --> 01:07:33.808
We will do what we can to aid you.

01:07:34.652 --> 01:07:36.563
Frodo Baggins of the Shire?

01:08:01.812 --> 01:08:06.681
<i>"Let the night never cease to call you</i>

01:08:07.572 --> 01:08:11.451
<i>"Let the day never more be the same"</i>

01:08:11.532 --> 01:08:13.648
It is a song about Gandalf, isn't it?

01:08:13.732 --> 01:08:17.202
Yes, Mithrandir
was the Elves' name for him.

01:08:17.292 --> 01:08:18.770
It means, Grey Pilgrim.

01:08:18.852 --> 01:08:23.163
We knew so little of him in the Shire,
Aragorn. He was just Gandalf, to us.

01:08:23.292 --> 01:08:25.362
We never knew he had so many names.

01:08:25.612 --> 01:08:27.682
I think he was fondest of Gandalf.

01:08:27.772 --> 01:08:31.242
<i>"We're still guided by your light</i>

01:08:32.332 --> 01:08:36.609
<i>"You're walking beside us</i>

01:08:38.091 --> 01:08:41.368
<i>"A prayer in the night</i>

01:08:42.652 --> 01:08:46.930
<i>"With the fear rushing through the shadows</i>

01:08:47.412 --> 01:08:51.291
<i>"Like a star shining deep in his heart</i>

01:08:52.772 --> 01:08:56.845
<i>"You will know in your hearts forever</i>

01:08:57.932 --> 01:09:00.002
<i>"Never more</i>

01:09:00.091 --> 01:09:02.765
<i>"Will we stand</i>

01:09:03.252 --> 01:09:05.925
<i>"Alone"</i>

01:09:07.532 --> 01:09:09.648
This is the mirror of Galadriel.

01:09:10.812 --> 01:09:13.689
It shows things that were,
and things that are...

01:09:14.332 --> 01:09:18.245
...and things that yet may be.
Do you wish to look?

01:09:20.252 --> 01:09:22.765
I'd not mind a glimpse
of what's going on at home.

01:09:22.852 --> 01:09:25.241
It seems a terrible long time
I've been away.

01:09:25.332 --> 01:09:27.287
Come then, you shall look...

01:09:28.091 --> 01:09:30.367
...and see what you may.

01:09:32.572 --> 01:09:35.291
I got to go home!
They've dug up Bagshot Row...

01:09:35.372 --> 01:09:37.886
...and thrown my poor old Gaffer
out in the street.

01:09:37.971 --> 01:09:39.291
I've got to go home.

01:09:39.372 --> 01:09:43.206
The mirror shows many things, Sam,
and not all have yet come to pass.

01:09:43.772 --> 01:09:47.810
Some never come to be,
unless those that behold the visions...

01:09:48.051 --> 01:09:50.691
...turn aside from their path
to prevent them.

01:09:54.051 --> 01:09:57.203
Do you wish to leave Frodo now,
and go home?

01:09:58.332 --> 01:09:59.321
No.

01:10:07.132 --> 01:10:08.167
Gandalf?

01:10:09.332 --> 01:10:11.527
No, it must be Saruman.

01:10:26.852 --> 01:10:28.490
Do not touch the water.

01:10:30.172 --> 01:10:31.685
He is looking for you.

01:10:32.012 --> 01:10:34.446
But he cannot find you, not here, not yet.

01:10:35.132 --> 01:10:36.531
The door is closed.

01:10:39.292 --> 01:10:42.409
"Three Rings for the Elven-kings
under the sky."

01:10:43.172 --> 01:10:44.002
Yes.

01:10:45.172 --> 01:10:48.403
We hid those three from him,
and he has never touched them.

01:10:48.972 --> 01:10:51.964
If your quest fails, then nothing can stand...

01:10:52.132 --> 01:10:54.566
...against him and we are defenseless.

01:10:54.812 --> 01:10:58.725
Yet, if you succeed,
if the One Ring is destroyed...

01:10:58.972 --> 01:11:01.532
...all we built with the three will fade.

01:11:01.932 --> 01:11:05.527
Time will come here,
and Lothlorien will fade.

01:11:06.572 --> 01:11:09.291
You are the footstep of doom to us, Frodo.

01:11:10.092 --> 01:11:13.767
Lady Galadriel, I will give you
the One Ring, if you ask for it.

01:11:15.332 --> 01:11:17.243
It's too great a matter for me.

01:11:21.852 --> 01:11:24.366
And I came to test your heart.

01:11:25.892 --> 01:11:28.884
You will give me the Great Ring freely...

01:11:29.692 --> 01:11:33.128
...and in place of the Dark Lord
you will set up a queen.

01:11:33.932 --> 01:11:36.526
And I shall not be evil, but beautiful...

01:11:36.652 --> 01:11:39.610
...and terrible as the morning
and the night.

01:11:40.492 --> 01:11:43.165
Stronger than the foundations of the earth.

01:11:43.252 --> 01:11:46.801
All shall love me and despair!

01:11:50.212 --> 01:11:52.043
I pass the test.

01:11:53.572 --> 01:11:56.166
I will diminish and go into the west...

01:11:56.492 --> 01:11:58.084
...and remain Galadriel.

01:11:59.132 --> 01:12:01.600
And you must depart in the morning.

01:12:09.932 --> 01:12:12.400
For Gondor and the House of Isildur.

01:12:12.972 --> 01:12:15.884
For Gondor and the city of Minas Tirith.

01:12:22.212 --> 01:12:24.567
In a few days, we will have to choose:

01:12:24.652 --> 01:12:27.803
Shall we turn west with Boromir
and go to the wars of Gondor...

01:12:27.892 --> 01:12:30.565
...or turn east to Mordor and its Dark Lord?

01:12:30.652 --> 01:12:32.722
Or shall we break our fellowship?

01:12:32.812 --> 01:12:34.484
I'm going with Mr. Frodo.

01:12:35.092 --> 01:12:36.411
I know that, Sam.

01:12:40.332 --> 01:12:43.642
What a place. What a horrible place!

01:12:48.652 --> 01:12:52.486
Behold the Argonath,
the pillars of the kings.

01:12:53.812 --> 01:12:57.122
They are Isildur and Anarion,
my fathers of old.

01:12:58.812 --> 01:13:00.564
If Gandalf were here...

01:13:12.132 --> 01:13:16.171
The day has come at last, the day
of choice, which we have long delayed.

01:13:17.732 --> 01:13:19.962
What shall now become of our company?

01:13:21.492 --> 01:13:24.086
I am not Gandalf.

01:13:24.212 --> 01:13:27.170
I have tried to guide you
as he would've done, but...

01:13:27.812 --> 01:13:30.884
...if he had any plan for this moment,
he never told me.

01:13:31.212 --> 01:13:35.410
Even if he had, if he had lived...

01:13:36.172 --> 01:13:39.482
...I think the burden
would still have fallen on you, Frodo.

01:13:39.732 --> 01:13:41.768
You alone can choose your way now.

01:13:43.372 --> 01:13:44.805
The burden is heavy.

01:13:46.212 --> 01:13:48.328
Give me an hour longer, and I will speak.

01:13:48.412 --> 01:13:49.731
Let me be alone!

01:13:51.412 --> 01:13:54.529
You shall have your hour.
And you shall be alone.

01:14:00.852 --> 01:14:02.410
Who's there?

01:14:04.812 --> 01:14:05.767
Boromir.

01:14:05.932 --> 01:14:07.763
I was afraid for you, Frodo.

01:14:09.452 --> 01:14:11.920
The Orcs may be on this side
of the river by now.

01:14:12.012 --> 01:14:14.367
May I stay and talk to you, just for a while?

01:14:14.452 --> 01:14:17.046
You're kind, but there's nothing to be said.

01:14:17.372 --> 01:14:20.603
I know what I should do,
but I'm afraid of doing it, Boromir.

01:14:20.692 --> 01:14:23.490
I wish I could help you.
Will you hear my counsel?

01:14:23.572 --> 01:14:25.927
I know what your advice would be:

01:14:26.012 --> 01:14:29.209
To go with you to Gondor
and use the Ring to defend Minas Tirith.

01:14:29.292 --> 01:14:31.169
And is that such ill counsel?

01:14:32.052 --> 01:14:35.044
Why should we fear to use the Ring
in a just cause?

01:14:35.132 --> 01:14:37.930
Whatever is done with the Ring
turns to evil.

01:14:38.012 --> 01:14:41.607
Gandalf and Elrond refused to touch it,
and Galadriel herself...

01:14:41.852 --> 01:14:43.763
Yes, I know all that.

01:14:43.892 --> 01:14:47.680
And for themselves, they may be right,
these Elves and half-Elves and Wizards!

01:14:47.772 --> 01:14:50.240
But truehearted Men will not be corrupted.

01:14:50.332 --> 01:14:52.482
We, of Minas Tirith, do not seek power.

01:14:52.572 --> 01:14:54.642
Only the strength to defend ourselves.

01:14:54.732 --> 01:14:57.121
Where is the evil in that, Frodo?

01:14:58.692 --> 01:15:00.648
You cannot answer me, none of them can.

01:15:00.732 --> 01:15:03.200
It's folly not using the Enemy's power
against him.

01:15:03.292 --> 01:15:06.011
Think what Aragorn could do
with the Ring in this hour.

01:15:06.092 --> 01:15:08.686
Or if he refuses, why not Boromir?

01:15:10.692 --> 01:15:15.766
How I would drive the hosts of Mordor,
until I stood face to face with Sauron.

01:15:15.852 --> 01:15:18.002
And they tell us to throw it away!

01:15:19.132 --> 01:15:20.690
Come with me, Frodo.

01:15:22.172 --> 01:15:23.844
My city is not far.

01:15:23.972 --> 01:15:26.361
You can go to Mordor from there,
if you must.

01:15:26.452 --> 01:15:29.091
Only, trust me, let me try my plan.

01:15:30.372 --> 01:15:31.851
Lend me the Ring.

01:15:32.372 --> 01:15:34.886
No, Boromir. No!

01:15:35.492 --> 01:15:38.928
Fool, obstinate fool!
It is only yours by chance.

01:15:39.012 --> 01:15:40.889
It might have been mine.

01:15:40.972 --> 01:15:43.202
It should be mine. Give it to me!

01:15:47.052 --> 01:15:48.531
Miserable trickster!

01:15:48.972 --> 01:15:50.849
You'll sell us all to Sauron.

01:15:52.092 --> 01:15:54.083
Traitor!

01:15:54.652 --> 01:15:58.327
Curse you to death and darkness,
all you Halflings!

01:16:02.532 --> 01:16:04.170
What have I done?

01:16:06.092 --> 01:16:07.684
Frodo, come back!

01:16:08.492 --> 01:16:11.450
A madness took me, but it has passed.

01:16:12.012 --> 01:16:13.923
Come back!

01:16:23.452 --> 01:16:25.329
This waiting's horrible.

01:16:26.372 --> 01:16:29.569
Where have you been, Boromir?
Have you seen Frodo?

01:16:30.932 --> 01:16:33.924
I tried to convince him
to come to Minas Tirith.

01:16:36.052 --> 01:16:39.408
I grew angry and he vanished.

01:16:39.732 --> 01:16:41.927
Is that all you have to say?

01:16:43.412 --> 01:16:44.561
He put the Ring on.

01:16:44.652 --> 01:16:46.961
But where did he go? Where is he?

01:16:47.052 --> 01:16:49.691
Mr. Frodo!

01:16:49.772 --> 01:16:51.728
Gimli, Legolas, stop them!

01:16:53.652 --> 01:16:57.088
I don't know what part you've played
in this mischief, but help now!

01:16:57.172 --> 01:17:01.768
Go after Merry and Pippin and guard them,
even if you cannot find Frodo. Go on!

01:17:07.785 --> 01:17:09.935
Follow me, Sam. Stay close.

01:17:11.105 --> 01:17:14.700
Sam Gamgee, your legs are too short,
so use your head.

01:17:19.425 --> 01:17:21.336
The boats.

01:17:25.905 --> 01:17:27.338
Coming, Mr. Frodo.

01:17:27.425 --> 01:17:28.540
Coming!

01:17:29.425 --> 01:17:31.143
It's only water, now.

01:17:38.585 --> 01:17:39.813
I'm here, Sam.

01:17:39.905 --> 01:17:41.258
Save me, Mr. Frodo.

01:17:41.345 --> 01:17:42.744
Help, I'm drowning!

01:17:42.825 --> 01:17:44.736
- Take my hand.
- Where's your hand?

01:17:44.825 --> 01:17:46.463
Here. Here it is.

01:17:50.545 --> 01:17:53.298
Of all the confounded nuisances
I ever knew.

01:17:53.585 --> 01:17:55.541
Mr. Frodo, that's hard.

01:17:55.665 --> 01:17:58.225
If I hadn't guessed right,
where would you be now?

01:17:58.305 --> 01:17:59.943
Safely on my way.

01:18:00.305 --> 01:18:03.456
"Safely"?
All alone and without me to help you?

01:18:03.545 --> 01:18:05.854
But I am going to Mordor.

01:18:07.305 --> 01:18:10.775
Well, of course you are,
Mr. Frodo, and I'm coming with you.

01:18:16.065 --> 01:18:18.454
It's no good trying to escape you.

01:18:20.385 --> 01:18:22.137
I'm glad, Sam.

01:18:25.825 --> 01:18:28.293
May the others find a safe road.

01:18:28.505 --> 01:18:30.382
Aragorn will look after them.

01:18:32.105 --> 01:18:35.859
I don't suppose we shall see them again.

01:18:36.185 --> 01:18:39.973
Yet we may, Mr. Frodo. We may.

01:18:51.305 --> 01:18:53.375
- This way!
- Frodo!

01:19:00.465 --> 01:19:01.693
Halfling.

01:20:41.145 --> 01:20:42.260
Boromir.

01:21:08.065 --> 01:21:09.214
Boromir.

01:21:11.665 --> 01:21:14.054
I tried to take the Ring from Frodo.

01:21:14.705 --> 01:21:18.220
I'm sorry. I have paid.

01:21:21.345 --> 01:21:24.496
Aragorn, go to Minas Tirith.

01:21:25.065 --> 01:21:26.578
Save my people.

01:21:28.745 --> 01:21:29.939
Aragorn...

01:21:31.985 --> 01:21:33.134
I will go...

01:21:33.985 --> 01:21:35.338
...I promise you.

01:21:36.625 --> 01:21:40.174
The Halflings, Orcs took them.

01:21:40.865 --> 01:21:44.824
I think they are not dead.

01:22:12.145 --> 01:22:16.343
Either we take the last boat and follow
Frodo, or we follow the Orcs on foot.

01:22:16.425 --> 01:22:19.462
Pippin and Merry may be dead by now.
We don't know.

01:22:21.465 --> 01:22:23.376
We cannot forsake them.

01:22:24.025 --> 01:22:27.301
The fate of the Ring-bearer
is in my hands no longer.

01:22:27.865 --> 01:22:32.985
The Company of the Ring
has played its part. We follow the Orcs.

01:24:58.225 --> 01:24:59.135
Filth!

01:24:59.225 --> 01:25:00.658
Maggots!

01:25:00.745 --> 01:25:03.100
Can't run.

01:25:40.945 --> 01:25:45.018
Hello, Pippin.
So you've come on this expedition, too?

01:25:46.945 --> 01:25:48.742
When do we get bed and breakfast?

01:25:48.825 --> 01:25:53.535
Bed and breakfast in Isengard, understand?

01:26:22.785 --> 01:26:23.900
They are alive.

01:26:23.985 --> 01:26:25.259
One of them, anyway.

01:26:25.345 --> 01:26:27.461
Pippin, I think, by the footprints.

01:26:28.025 --> 01:26:30.619
How far ahead of us are they, Aragorn?

01:26:30.705 --> 01:26:35.779
Almost a day. Shall we rest by night,
or go on while our strength holds?

01:26:35.865 --> 01:26:37.537
Do you think the Orcs will rest?

01:26:37.625 --> 01:26:42.415
Yet, in the dark we may lose the trail,
or miss a sign, like that brooch.

01:26:42.505 --> 01:26:44.541
There will be no more signs.

01:26:44.745 --> 01:26:47.896
I cannot run all the way to Isengard.

01:28:24.705 --> 01:28:27.060
Thank goodness for that rope
the Elves gave you.

01:28:27.145 --> 01:28:30.182
We'd never have gotten down
that last cliff without it.

01:28:38.985 --> 01:28:42.136
There's Mount Doom again, Mr. Frodo.
See it?

01:28:52.265 --> 01:28:53.778
What a fix!

01:28:53.905 --> 01:28:56.703
The one place
that we don't want to see any closer...

01:28:56.785 --> 01:28:59.663
...and that's the one place
we're trying to get to.

01:29:02.545 --> 01:29:04.581
We're plain lost, Mr. Frodo.

01:29:11.705 --> 01:29:14.265
I'm tired, Sam.
I don't know what's to be done.

01:29:14.345 --> 01:29:18.418
We must find a place to camp, I suppose.
Maybe there'll be a path tomorrow.

01:29:26.265 --> 01:29:28.825
Cautious, my precious.

01:29:38.105 --> 01:29:39.174
Don't turn!

01:29:40.305 --> 01:29:41.454
It's him.

01:29:47.665 --> 01:29:50.941
That Gollum?
That thing who had Mr. Bilbo's ring?

01:29:51.065 --> 01:29:53.056
He's been following us since Moria.

01:29:53.145 --> 01:29:56.501
My precious! More haste, less speed.

01:29:59.105 --> 01:30:01.460
Well, he'll be sorry he found us again.

01:30:01.625 --> 01:30:05.140
Be careful!
He's much more dangerous than he looks.

01:30:14.265 --> 01:30:17.257
Where is it, my precious?

01:30:18.225 --> 01:30:21.900
It's ours, it is, and we wants it.

01:30:26.265 --> 01:30:28.062
Got you, you spying...

01:30:32.785 --> 01:30:36.016
Let go, Gollum!
Let go, or I'll cut your throat!

01:30:36.105 --> 01:30:37.504
Don't hurt us!

01:30:37.585 --> 01:30:39.541
Don't let them hurt us, precious.

01:30:39.625 --> 01:30:41.695
Cruel little Hobbitses.

01:30:43.385 --> 01:30:47.139
Jumps on us
like cats on poor mices, Gollum.

01:30:48.425 --> 01:30:53.499
We'll be nice to them if they'll be nice
to us, won't we, precious?

01:30:54.665 --> 01:30:58.101
Pity Mr. Bilbo didn't kill the creature
when he had the chance.

01:30:58.745 --> 01:31:02.499
I will not touch him.
Now that I see him, I do pity him.

01:31:02.625 --> 01:31:07.141
Yes, Hobbits won't kill us,
not Hobbits, huh?

01:31:07.225 --> 01:31:09.819
No, we won't.
But we won't let you go, either.

01:31:09.945 --> 01:31:12.698
You will have to come with us
and help us, if you can.

01:31:12.785 --> 01:31:14.901
Yes, indeed!

01:31:15.305 --> 01:31:16.624
Nice Hobbits!

01:31:18.185 --> 01:31:22.701
And where are they going in these cold,
hard lands, we wonder?

01:31:22.865 --> 01:31:25.060
We are going to Mordor. You know that.

01:31:25.145 --> 01:31:27.215
Lead us to the gates of his land.

01:31:28.985 --> 01:31:30.498
No, precious.

01:31:30.585 --> 01:31:32.382
Hobbits mustn't go there.

01:31:32.465 --> 01:31:34.660
Gollum! Leave us alone!

01:31:35.545 --> 01:31:36.500
Gotcha!

01:31:38.905 --> 01:31:41.339
I think your rope might prove useful again.

01:31:41.425 --> 01:31:44.098
Tie one end to his ankle.
We want him to walk.

01:31:44.185 --> 01:31:46.460
Don't hurt us! No!

01:31:52.385 --> 01:31:54.262
It burns! It bites!

01:31:54.425 --> 01:31:55.938
It freezes!

01:31:56.025 --> 01:31:58.095
Take it off us. It hurts us.

01:31:58.265 --> 01:31:59.459
Don't you do it!

01:31:59.545 --> 01:32:00.944
It hurts us.

01:32:01.105 --> 01:32:03.300
What promise can you give me
that I can trust?

01:32:03.385 --> 01:32:06.183
Sméagol will be very good.

01:32:06.705 --> 01:32:09.936
Sméagol will swear
never to let him have it.

01:32:10.265 --> 01:32:12.017
Sméagol will save it.

01:32:12.465 --> 01:32:16.253
The precious is before you, Sméagol.
Speak your promise!

01:32:17.465 --> 01:32:20.855
We promises, yes, I promise...

01:32:21.545 --> 01:32:24.742
...I will serve the master of the precious.

01:32:25.145 --> 01:32:28.421
- Good master.
- Good Sméagol.

01:32:28.505 --> 01:32:30.336
Take the rope off, Sam.

01:32:33.145 --> 01:32:35.943
Off we go. Follow Sméagol.

01:32:36.385 --> 01:32:40.981
Sméagol knows a secret way, he does,
across the marshes.

01:32:41.105 --> 01:32:42.333
Follow Sméagol.

01:33:20.865 --> 01:33:24.460
I said, "No shooting."

01:33:24.865 --> 01:33:29.461
You're wasting arrows, dunghill swine!

01:33:35.105 --> 01:33:38.984
Snaga, Lugdush, stand guard.

01:33:39.505 --> 01:33:41.860
Bind their legs.

01:33:42.145 --> 01:33:45.774
White-skins break through. Understand?

01:33:46.345 --> 01:33:49.098
You and your stinking Wizard.

01:33:49.465 --> 01:33:51.376
You got us into this.

01:33:52.025 --> 01:33:55.574
When I tell them in Mordor...

01:34:00.505 --> 01:34:04.100
They are far, far away.

01:34:24.385 --> 01:34:28.014
If stinking Wizard doesn't get you,
the white-skins will.

01:34:28.425 --> 01:34:31.576
You won't get it that way.
It isn't easy to find.

01:34:32.745 --> 01:34:35.464
Get it? Get what?

01:34:36.345 --> 01:34:38.859
Nothing, my precious.

01:34:41.705 --> 01:34:43.775
It's no good groping in the dark.

01:34:44.225 --> 01:34:46.181
Ugluk will be back any minute.

01:34:46.345 --> 01:34:47.824
Nothing for Mordor.

01:34:47.905 --> 01:34:51.784
Nothing for poor Grishnakh and Gollum.

01:34:53.105 --> 01:34:57.178
- Untie us, my precious.
- I said to be quiet!

01:34:58.265 --> 01:35:01.780
Wait. You can't find it without our help.

01:35:01.865 --> 01:35:03.901
You help me.

01:36:04.625 --> 01:36:06.980
I don't know what to do now.
I don't even know where we are.

01:36:07.065 --> 01:36:10.182
You should have studied maps more
and played less in Rivendell.

01:36:10.265 --> 01:36:12.017
This is Fangorn Forest.

01:36:12.825 --> 01:36:15.464
Then we're no safer
than we were with the Orcs.

01:36:15.665 --> 01:36:19.977
We've no blankets and almost no food.
It looks like nothing to eat for 100 miles.

01:36:21.025 --> 01:36:23.300
We don't even know
where we're trying to go.

01:36:23.385 --> 01:36:24.898
Let's climb up there.

01:36:25.105 --> 01:36:27.665
Maybe we can find out
where we are, at least.

01:36:36.785 --> 01:36:38.457
It's nice here.

01:36:39.705 --> 01:36:42.265
The forest looks so different
in the sunlight.

01:36:42.345 --> 01:36:43.460
I know.

01:36:43.945 --> 01:36:47.221
It's funny, but, well,
I almost feel I like the place.

01:36:47.905 --> 01:36:51.341
Almost felt you liked the forest?

01:36:52.025 --> 01:36:55.700
That's uncommonly kind of you.

01:36:57.545 --> 01:36:59.854
The Orcs made us run here,
and when we tired...

01:36:59.945 --> 01:37:04.097
...they carried us, cut our ropes and ran
into the forest and we came to your hill...

01:37:04.185 --> 01:37:05.095
"Hill?"

01:37:06.905 --> 01:37:08.861
A hasty word...

01:37:09.465 --> 01:37:14.823
...for something that has stood here
since the world was shaped.

01:37:17.105 --> 01:37:20.381
You may call me Treebeard.

01:37:20.665 --> 01:37:23.133
We thought you were a tree,
standing there.

01:37:23.305 --> 01:37:26.900
Not a tree, a tree herder.

01:37:27.385 --> 01:37:29.455
Please, Treebeard...

01:37:29.945 --> 01:37:32.015
...now that you know our story...

01:37:32.625 --> 01:37:34.024
...whose side are you on?

01:37:34.105 --> 01:37:37.415
I am not altogether on anybody's side...

01:37:37.865 --> 01:37:41.653
...because nobody is altogether on my side.

01:37:41.985 --> 01:37:44.340
But I am no friend of these...

01:37:44.425 --> 01:37:48.259
...tree-killing Orcs and their masters.

01:37:58.425 --> 01:38:00.734
They were here, no doubt of it.

01:38:01.305 --> 01:38:04.820
- But where they went...
- I don't understand these other marks.

01:38:05.705 --> 01:38:06.694
Look!

01:38:09.505 --> 01:38:11.496
Your bow, Legolas! It's Saruman.

01:38:11.585 --> 01:38:14.418
- Shoot before he puts a spell on us, fast!
- Elf...

01:38:15.065 --> 01:38:18.421
...Man and Dwarf together?

01:38:19.025 --> 01:38:21.141
A rare sight in these times.

01:38:21.625 --> 01:38:23.456
Stop him, Legolas!

01:38:33.625 --> 01:38:34.853
Gandalf?

01:38:35.545 --> 01:38:37.137
Beyond all hope.

01:38:38.785 --> 01:38:40.138
Gandalf!

01:38:40.225 --> 01:38:41.180
Yes.

01:38:42.265 --> 01:38:44.540
That was my name.

01:38:45.305 --> 01:38:48.058
But where have you... Gandalf!

01:38:48.985 --> 01:38:50.213
What happened?

01:38:50.905 --> 01:38:52.338
A long time I fell.

01:38:53.385 --> 01:38:56.024
<i>Long I fell and he fell with me.</i>

01:38:56.465 --> 01:38:58.183
<i>His fire was about me.</i>

01:38:58.425 --> 01:38:59.744
<i>I was burned.</i>

01:39:00.065 --> 01:39:04.138
<i>Ever he clutched me</i>, <i>and ever</i>
<i>I hewed him</i>, <i>far under the living earth...</i>

01:39:04.305 --> 01:39:08.264
<i>... until at last</i>, <i>he fled back up</i>
<i>the secret ways of Moria.</i>

01:39:08.665 --> 01:39:11.896
<i>There we fought</i>,
<i>above the mists of the world...</i>

01:39:12.025 --> 01:39:14.698
<i>... and the mountain was wreathed</i>
<i>with lightning.</i>

01:39:14.905 --> 01:39:19.854
<i>I threw down my enemy</i>
<i>and his fall broke the mountainside.</i>

01:39:21.465 --> 01:39:23.695
<i>Then darkness took me...</i>

01:39:23.945 --> 01:39:27.221
<i>... and I wandered far</i>,
<i>on roads that I will not tell.</i>

01:39:28.105 --> 01:39:30.494
<i>Naked</i>, <i>I was sent back for a brief time...</i>

01:39:31.225 --> 01:39:32.977
...until my task was done.

01:39:33.185 --> 01:39:35.062
And it is time I was about it.

01:39:35.465 --> 01:39:40.175
You come with me to Edoras, my friends,
to the city of the Riders?

01:39:40.985 --> 01:39:42.498
<i>To Edoras</i>, <i>now?</i>

01:39:44.345 --> 01:39:46.256
<i>But to leave Merry and Pippin?</i>

01:39:46.345 --> 01:39:48.813
<i>They are in no danger</i>, <i>believe me.</i>

01:39:49.305 --> 01:39:51.296
<i>The great danger is to Edoras.</i>

01:39:51.385 --> 01:39:56.539
<i>Saruman's Orcs will attack there within</i>
<i>two days</i>, <i>and Theoden has need of us.</i>

01:39:57.545 --> 01:39:59.137
<i>Theoden has grown old.</i>

01:39:59.705 --> 01:40:01.855
<i>He shivers by his fire now...</i>

01:40:01.945 --> 01:40:05.176
<i>... and leaves everything in the hands</i>
<i>of his new minister:</i>

01:40:05.665 --> 01:40:07.815
<i>Grima Wormtongue.</i>

01:40:08.265 --> 01:40:11.257
<i>Those Riders you followed</i>,
<i>who rescued Merry and Pippin...</i>

01:40:11.345 --> 01:40:14.178
<i>... they were led by Theoden's nephew</i>,
<i>Eomer.</i>

01:40:14.265 --> 01:40:17.098
<i>He is all but an outlaw</i>
<i>in Rohan these days.</i>

01:40:17.185 --> 01:40:19.415
<i>He hunts the Orcs</i>
<i>wherever he finds them...</i>

01:40:19.505 --> 01:40:22.542
<i>... defying Wormtongue's orders</i>
<i>to let them pass.</i>

01:40:22.625 --> 01:40:26.459
<i>So Wormtongue calls him traitor</i>
<i>and renegade...</i>

01:40:26.545 --> 01:40:28.297
<i>... and Theoden believes</i>...

01:40:28.385 --> 01:40:31.457
<i>Gandalf</i>, <i>the Riders of Rohan</i>
<i>are the bravest fighters...</i>

01:40:31.745 --> 01:40:33.542
<i>... but they were never many.</i>

01:40:33.705 --> 01:40:38.096
<i>If Saruman strikes now</i>,
<i>he'll overrun Edoras in a single night.</i>

01:40:42.465 --> 01:40:44.183
Our time is at hand.

01:40:44.985 --> 01:40:49.024
Theoden's hundreds will face
your tens of thousands.

01:40:52.345 --> 01:40:56.338
When all of Rohan, your ancient oppressor,
lies vanquished...

01:40:56.625 --> 01:40:58.980
...then shall we fly eastward...

01:40:59.105 --> 01:41:03.178
...and sweep all of Middle-earth
beneath our feet.

01:41:03.425 --> 01:41:06.337
We cannot be defeated!

01:41:16.025 --> 01:41:20.894
<i>Halfway between Edoras and Isengard</i>,
<i>there lies a fortress called Helm's Deep.</i>

01:41:21.585 --> 01:41:23.860
<i>If we can decoy Saruman's Orcs there...</i>

01:41:23.945 --> 01:41:27.699
<i>... the fortress will stop them longer</i>
<i>than the wooden halls of Edoras.</i>

01:41:27.985 --> 01:41:30.340
<i>We are buying time</i>, <i>Aragorn.</i>

01:41:30.425 --> 01:41:32.416
<i>Time? Time for what?</i>

01:41:32.505 --> 01:41:34.063
<i>Perhaps for a miracle.</i>

01:41:34.665 --> 01:41:37.702
Perhaps only for Frodo
to get a little further on his way...

01:41:37.785 --> 01:41:40.822
...while the armies
that should be hunting for the Ring...

01:41:40.905 --> 01:41:43.180
...waste their own time destroying us.

01:41:53.585 --> 01:41:54.734
I have returned.

01:41:54.825 --> 01:41:59.216
The storm comes swiftly, and it is time
for all friends to gather together.

01:42:00.665 --> 01:42:01.654
And...

01:42:01.985 --> 01:42:03.100
...do you...

01:42:03.505 --> 01:42:05.097
...expect me...

01:42:05.185 --> 01:42:06.857
...to welcome you here...

01:42:07.385 --> 01:42:08.898
...Master Gandalf?

01:42:10.065 --> 01:42:13.023
Troubles follow you like crows.

01:42:13.425 --> 01:42:17.304
Why should I welcome you,
Gandalf Stormcrow?

01:42:17.625 --> 01:42:19.377
Justly spoken, Lord.

01:42:19.905 --> 01:42:22.339
In the east, the Dark Lord is stirring...

01:42:22.465 --> 01:42:26.663
...in Lorien, the Sorceress
of the Golden Wood weaves deceit.

01:42:26.745 --> 01:42:31.421
And such is the hour
in which this wanderer chooses to return.

01:42:32.665 --> 01:42:33.700
It is I...

01:42:34.025 --> 01:42:37.574
...who counsel the King now.
He hears you no longer.

01:42:37.665 --> 01:42:39.417
No, Grima Wormtongue.

01:42:39.985 --> 01:42:43.819
He hears nothing but your voice
telling him that he rules here...

01:42:43.905 --> 01:42:46.499
...only because Saruman
is kind to old men...

01:42:46.745 --> 01:42:49.737
...and that the best thing for a sickly,
feeble king...

01:42:49.905 --> 01:42:53.693
...is to let Wizards and Orcs
do as they will in Rohan.

01:42:54.105 --> 01:42:57.302
I am my own man, Gandalf...

01:42:58.785 --> 01:43:00.184
...as I was.

01:43:01.745 --> 01:43:03.383
It is true that...

01:43:03.865 --> 01:43:07.699
...Grima advises me often to leave
Saruman in peace...

01:43:08.785 --> 01:43:10.855
Hear, my Lord, you tire yourself.

01:43:11.065 --> 01:43:12.623
You are still unwell.

01:43:12.745 --> 01:43:16.738
And he does remind me
that it would be safest for Rohan...

01:43:16.825 --> 01:43:18.417
...to seek their friendship...

01:43:18.505 --> 01:43:20.063
...no matter how I may feel!

01:43:20.145 --> 01:43:23.455
Dear Lord, let me deal with
these troublesome guests.

01:43:24.145 --> 01:43:26.739
How long has it been, Grima Wormtongue?

01:43:27.385 --> 01:43:30.422
How long since Saruman bought you?

01:43:31.225 --> 01:43:33.341
For I saw you at Isengard.

01:43:35.665 --> 01:43:39.055
Did I not counsel your doorkeeper
to forbid his staff?

01:43:40.025 --> 01:43:42.414
Down, snake.

01:43:43.065 --> 01:43:45.135
Down on your belly.

01:43:47.665 --> 01:43:49.621
Grima is often...

01:43:50.265 --> 01:43:54.463
...at Isengard.
I sent him there with messages.

01:43:54.665 --> 01:43:56.860
And he returns with poison...

01:43:57.465 --> 01:44:00.502
...Saruman's poison in your ears, Theoden.

01:44:00.585 --> 01:44:02.860
Chilling your heart, making you old.

01:44:02.945 --> 01:44:05.539
Take courage, Lord of Rohan!

01:44:06.105 --> 01:44:07.060
Grima...

01:44:08.665 --> 01:44:09.984
...is this so?

01:44:10.825 --> 01:44:13.134
I will not harm you, Grima.

01:44:14.585 --> 01:44:16.018
Is it so?

01:44:26.945 --> 01:44:28.173
Let him go!

01:44:31.505 --> 01:44:34.975
My sister-daughter, Eowyn.

01:44:36.305 --> 01:44:38.136
My only loyal kin...

01:44:38.225 --> 01:44:41.695
...since her brother has disobeyed
my commands.

01:44:41.785 --> 01:44:44.345
Wormtongue's command, Theoden.

01:44:44.825 --> 01:44:46.463
If Eomer had not defied him...

01:44:46.545 --> 01:44:50.697
...their cause might be already lost.
- Tell me, Gandalf...

01:44:51.225 --> 01:44:52.783
...what I must do now.

01:44:53.865 --> 01:44:56.254
We cannot wait here for Saruman's attack.

01:44:56.345 --> 01:44:58.905
Every man that can ride
must be sent immediately...

01:44:58.985 --> 01:45:01.260
...to the old fortress of Helm's Deep.

01:45:02.625 --> 01:45:06.061
When Saruman learns
that we have gone there, and he will...

01:45:06.505 --> 01:45:08.621
...we will have the Riders of Rohan.

01:45:09.225 --> 01:45:11.500
I will find Eomer and his Riders.

01:45:12.025 --> 01:45:13.140
My armor!

01:45:35.185 --> 01:45:37.221
Look for me at Helm's Deep.

01:45:37.905 --> 01:45:40.180
That's all, Theoden.

01:45:48.385 --> 01:45:49.943
And he's gone again...

01:45:50.345 --> 01:45:52.176
...like a wind in the grass.

01:45:52.665 --> 01:45:54.337
Stormcrow.

01:45:55.905 --> 01:45:57.896
- Aragorn?
- My Lord?

01:45:58.065 --> 01:45:59.976
Is there any hope for us?

01:46:38.025 --> 01:46:40.937
Sam, you simpleminded...

01:46:41.345 --> 01:46:42.664
You fell asleep.

01:46:44.505 --> 01:46:46.416
Mr. Frodo, he's gone.

01:46:47.025 --> 01:46:50.222
- Sméagol?
- He's gone. I didn't mean to sleep.

01:46:51.065 --> 01:46:54.216
Well, he'll come back.
Promise will hold him a while yet.

01:46:54.585 --> 01:46:56.860
He won't leave his precious, anyway.

01:46:57.945 --> 01:46:59.458
Are we rested?

01:47:00.825 --> 01:47:02.019
Ready to go on?

01:47:03.545 --> 01:47:05.183
Nice Hobbitses.

01:47:06.465 --> 01:47:08.456
Trust Sméagol now?

01:47:26.465 --> 01:47:27.693
Stop!

01:47:29.305 --> 01:47:30.624
Shivery light.

01:47:30.705 --> 01:47:33.378
Nasty.

01:47:33.665 --> 01:47:34.734
Look!

01:47:40.425 --> 01:47:41.653
Wraiths.

01:47:42.585 --> 01:47:47.420
Wraiths on wings!
The precious is calling them!

01:48:11.065 --> 01:48:14.899
Gollum, wait, Mr. Frodo can't keep up!
Slow down, I tell you.

01:48:15.505 --> 01:48:17.621
No time, no time.

01:48:18.265 --> 01:48:20.620
The precious is heavy, yes.

01:48:21.345 --> 01:48:24.542
Very heavy, Sméagol knows.

01:48:25.145 --> 01:48:28.501
If it's too heavy for nice Master...

01:48:28.825 --> 01:48:30.895
...little Sméagol will carry it.

01:48:31.265 --> 01:48:33.017
Sméagol doesn't mind.

01:48:33.425 --> 01:48:35.575
Give it to Sméagol.

01:48:36.385 --> 01:48:38.216
Do not say that again.

01:48:38.385 --> 01:48:39.818
Do not think it.

01:48:39.945 --> 01:48:42.300
Before you touched the precious again,
Sméagol...

01:48:42.385 --> 01:48:45.775
...I would put it on and have you
leap off a cliff, or into a fire...

01:48:45.865 --> 01:48:48.015
...and you would do it, Sméagol.

01:48:49.585 --> 01:48:50.700
Nice, Master.

01:48:50.785 --> 01:48:53.140
Nice, Master.

01:48:54.265 --> 01:48:55.744
Gollum!

01:49:13.665 --> 01:49:14.893
Sméagol promised.

01:49:14.985 --> 01:49:18.182
Yes, we promised to save our precious...

01:49:18.265 --> 01:49:20.335
...never to let him have it, but it's...

01:49:20.425 --> 01:49:25.101
...going to him,
my precious is nearer every step.

01:49:25.465 --> 01:49:28.821
I can't help it.
Sméagol promised to help nice Hobbit.

01:49:28.905 --> 01:49:33.023
He took cruel rope off our leg.
He speaks nicely to me.

01:49:33.865 --> 01:49:36.902
He's a Baggins, my precious.
A Baggins stoled it.

01:49:36.985 --> 01:49:39.340
We hates Bagginses.

01:49:39.585 --> 01:49:42.702
Must have the precious. Must have it.

01:49:42.985 --> 01:49:45.818
We wants it.

01:49:46.425 --> 01:49:48.017
But there's two of them.

01:49:49.065 --> 01:49:50.418
Yes.

01:49:50.905 --> 01:49:55.023
We needs help, precious.
She might help, yes.

01:49:55.665 --> 01:49:57.815
She might help us...

01:49:58.585 --> 01:50:01.941
...but Sméagol promised nice Hobbit.

01:50:06.385 --> 01:50:07.613
Nice Hobbit.

01:50:08.665 --> 01:50:09.780
Hey, you...

01:50:10.665 --> 01:50:12.701
...what are you pawing at him for?

01:50:12.985 --> 01:50:16.614
Where've you been anyway,
sneaking off and sneaking back?

01:50:18.385 --> 01:50:21.502
"Sneaking"?

01:50:22.745 --> 01:50:25.339
Hobbit's always so polite, yes.

01:50:25.665 --> 01:50:29.453
Tired, thirsty Sméagol, he finds
a secret way through the mountain...

01:50:29.545 --> 01:50:33.777
...a tunnel with no Orcses anywhere,
and they say "sneak."

01:50:34.105 --> 01:50:35.333
"Sneak"?

01:50:36.585 --> 01:50:39.622
Well, you startled me. I'm sorry.

01:50:42.625 --> 01:50:43.853
Hello, Sméagol.

01:50:44.705 --> 01:50:46.582
- Where have you been?
- Sneaking!

01:51:01.305 --> 01:51:02.977
I like this place.

01:51:03.505 --> 01:51:05.496
There is good rock here.

01:51:05.625 --> 01:51:08.219
This country has tough bones.

01:51:25.985 --> 01:51:29.694
Up on the ridge! They're coming!
There they are!

01:55:46.465 --> 01:55:48.137
Fire of Isengard!

01:55:53.505 --> 01:55:56.417
We're breached. Retreat to the caves.

01:55:56.905 --> 01:55:58.258
The caves!

01:57:28.545 --> 01:57:30.456
Theoden King.

01:57:31.385 --> 01:57:32.943
I will not end here...

01:57:33.625 --> 01:57:35.855
...taken like an old badger in a trap.

01:57:36.385 --> 01:57:37.738
When dawn comes...

01:57:38.585 --> 01:57:41.179
...I will bid men sound Helm's horn...

01:57:41.465 --> 01:57:43.217
...and I will ride forth.

01:57:43.985 --> 01:57:47.295
Will you ride with me then,
son of Arathorn?

01:57:47.825 --> 01:57:50.578
At least, we may make such an end...

01:57:51.225 --> 01:57:52.943
...as will be worth a song.

01:57:54.865 --> 01:57:56.344
I will ride with you.

01:58:05.945 --> 01:58:07.298
We're there, Sam.

01:58:07.865 --> 01:58:09.537
Another day, maybe two.

01:58:09.625 --> 01:58:12.219
When light comes tomorrow,
the mountains will be near.

01:58:12.305 --> 01:58:16.776
Well, it's a good thing, Mr. Frodo,
because we're running awful low on food.

01:58:17.225 --> 01:58:20.615
I reckon we've got enough left
to see us to this Mount Doom.

01:58:20.985 --> 01:58:22.179
After that...

01:58:22.545 --> 01:58:25.139
...I don't know.

01:58:27.705 --> 01:58:29.297
Samwise Gamgee.

01:58:29.785 --> 01:58:32.583
My dearest Hobbit, friend of friends...

01:58:33.705 --> 01:58:37.220
..."after that," if the Ring
goes into the fire, and we are at hand?

01:58:37.305 --> 01:58:39.023
"After that," dear Sam.

01:58:39.545 --> 01:58:40.978
I wouldn't worry.

01:58:41.065 --> 01:58:42.498
Just to get there.

01:58:42.865 --> 01:58:44.537
Just to get there.

01:58:44.985 --> 01:58:47.135
The Ring is so heavy now, Sam.

01:58:59.425 --> 01:59:01.939
We must go.

01:59:02.385 --> 01:59:04.740
Mustn't rest here, silly Hobbits.

01:59:05.465 --> 01:59:08.377
Orcs find us. Ringwraiths find us.

01:59:08.505 --> 01:59:11.577
Must go on to safe, secret place.

01:59:11.985 --> 01:59:14.055
Sméagol's secret way!

01:59:14.425 --> 01:59:15.904
The straight stair...

01:59:15.985 --> 01:59:20.615
...and the winding stair. Up, up...

01:59:21.425 --> 01:59:24.178
...through black, sharp mountains.

01:59:25.225 --> 01:59:26.783
Follow good Sméagol.

01:59:44.185 --> 01:59:46.653
Straight stair, winding stair...

01:59:47.105 --> 01:59:48.777
...what comes after that?

01:59:49.065 --> 01:59:51.943
We shall see, yes...

01:59:52.665 --> 01:59:54.257
...we shall see.

02:03:56.145 --> 02:03:57.339
Gandalf!

02:05:01.825 --> 02:05:05.898
<i>The forces of darkness were driven</i>
<i>forever from the face of Middle-earth...</i>

02:05:05.985 --> 02:05:08.545
<i>... by the valiant friends of Frodo.</i>

02:05:08.705 --> 02:05:10.855
<i>As their gallant battle ended...</i>

02:05:10.985 --> 02:05:13.738
<i>... so too ends the first great tale of...</i>

02:05:14.145 --> 02:05:16.613
...The Lord of the Rings.
