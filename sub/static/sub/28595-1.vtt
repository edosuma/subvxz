WEBVTT

00:13.378 --> 00:16.682
I just don't understand
the world any more.

00:17.378 --> 00:19.380
It all made sense up
until a few years back.

00:19.381 --> 00:21.396
The left was the left,
the right was the right.

00:21.532 --> 00:23.212
America was America.

00:23.309 --> 00:25.331
- Who's she?
- I couldn't even point to Syria...

00:25.372 --> 00:26.572
- Some woman...
- on a map.

00:26.832 --> 00:29.246
I just kissed the kids
goodnight, turned out the lights,

00:29.271 --> 00:30.699
looked forward to
waking up the next day.

00:30.723 --> 00:32.551
I dread it now, every day.

00:32.683 --> 00:34.027
- Dread.
- I like her.

00:34.738 --> 00:36.098
That man there, at the back.

00:36.123 --> 00:37.527
- Night then, sweetheart.
- Night.

00:38.417 --> 00:41.119
Milk's not good for you,
darling. It's just mucus.

00:41.854 --> 00:42.979
Don't have a go at her.

00:43.260 --> 00:44.947
No, I should do it more often.

00:46.189 --> 00:47.729
Signor, who's Vivienne Rook?

00:47.837 --> 00:49.306
Vivienne Alison Rook,

00:49.331 --> 00:51.867
born 1964 in Manchester.

00:51.892 --> 00:54.563
Founding member
of the JJC Think Tank.

00:54.930 --> 00:56.445
That woman there, in the blue.

00:56.684 --> 01:00.280
What would you say to a
Palestinian family on the Gaza Strip,

01:00.366 --> 01:03.413
when Israel has reduced
the electricity supply

01:03.438 --> 01:04.608
to two hours a day?

01:05.542 --> 01:07.272
- Two hours!?
- Yeah, I know.

01:08.224 --> 01:11.838
I know, but I suppose when it
comes to Israel and Palestine...

01:13.710 --> 01:14.938
I don't give a fuck.

01:16.450 --> 01:18.318
Oh, my God.

01:18.343 --> 01:19.386
What did she just say?

01:19.742 --> 01:22.402
- Well, now I like her even more.
- She can't say that!

01:22.713 --> 01:24.692
Go on, say it
again! Who is she?!

01:27.688 --> 01:28.948
Stephen's watching.

01:30.533 --> 01:31.549
Danny's seen it.

01:32.272 --> 01:33.819
I bet he's written a
letter of complaint.

01:33.843 --> 01:35.726
Look, number one
trending topic "Viv Rook".

01:35.978 --> 01:38.023
In, what, under 20 seconds?

01:38.361 --> 01:41.115
I have to apologise
to the people at home.

01:41.508 --> 01:43.022
You really can't say that.

01:43.047 --> 01:44.834
But I mean it, I mean it.

01:45.326 --> 01:47.598
Kiev, Yemen, Qatar.

01:47.677 --> 01:50.770
I simply do not give a...

01:50.795 --> 01:53.653
No, no, no, no. If you say that
again, I'll have to exclude you.

01:53.678 --> 01:54.680
Well, that's the
point, isn't it?

01:54.704 --> 01:56.264
We're not allowed
to say anything true.

01:56.542 --> 01:57.980
I have had enough.

01:58.004 --> 01:59.144
I have literally had enough.

01:59.169 --> 02:01.915
Lucy's watching, and
Javindra. Nell. Lynne.

02:02.761 --> 02:04.418
- Viv Rook for Strictly!
- Mm.

02:05.580 --> 02:07.136
Just headlines shouting at me.

02:07.161 --> 02:12.362
And all I want is for my bins to be
collected once a week, you know?

02:12.606 --> 02:13.964
I, I want...

02:13.988 --> 02:16.259
I want the primary school
200 yards from my house

02:16.284 --> 02:18.767
to pick up its own litter
and, for the love of God,

02:19.168 --> 02:20.720
my mother walks with a stick,

02:20.847 --> 02:23.680
could people please just stop
parking on the pavements?

02:24.157 --> 02:25.688
Could you just stop it?!

02:26.610 --> 02:29.990
So, ask me about Israel,
ask me about Palestine,

02:30.015 --> 02:33.937
ask me and I will tell
you I do not give a...

02:36.525 --> 02:37.759
monkeys.

02:39.415 --> 02:41.135
But I have got you
listening now, haven't I?

02:41.931 --> 02:44.413
- Oh, my God, she is a monster.
- I think she's brilliant.

02:48.202 --> 02:50.592
- Hello. Hello, are you all right?
- Hiya. It's me.

02:50.617 --> 02:52.417
Look, don't make a fuss,
but can you take Lee?

02:52.889 --> 02:55.084
Just get him to bed and give
him some toast for breakfast,

02:55.108 --> 02:57.482
he'll be fine. I'm on
my way to the hospital.

02:57.507 --> 02:59.810
- I started, I'm early.
- Er, right.

03:00.150 --> 03:01.957
Yeah, but what about Jan?

03:02.567 --> 03:03.767
I thought she was helping you.

03:03.863 --> 03:06.909
She was according to the birth
plan, but that's for next Monday,

03:07.199 --> 03:08.348
she's in London tonight.

03:08.373 --> 03:10.214
And Runi's had a
drink so she's useless.

03:10.239 --> 03:11.605
We're on our way
to Salford City,

03:11.630 --> 03:14.644
can you meet me there and pick
him up? Oh, and can you tell Gran?

03:14.722 --> 03:15.802
But who are you with, then?

03:16.373 --> 03:18.900
I'm being driven by Mr
Jayasundera from number six.

03:19.010 --> 03:20.567
Everything's under control.

03:20.888 --> 03:21.951
Sorry!

03:21.976 --> 03:25.622
No, no, no. I mean, but who's
going to be with you for the birth?

03:26.919 --> 03:28.403
I don't know.

03:28.428 --> 03:29.997
- She's on her own.
- Why's she on her own?

03:30.021 --> 03:33.849
I don't know. But...
will you be okay?

03:34.367 --> 03:36.491
I'm all right.
It's not my first.

03:38.835 --> 03:40.233
Mum should be with me, really.

03:40.313 --> 03:42.178
Er, er...

03:43.139 --> 03:44.677
Do you want me to be there?

03:46.550 --> 03:47.607
Would you?

03:48.708 --> 03:49.957
Er, yeah.

03:50.612 --> 03:52.599
Oh, course I will.
I'm on my way.

03:57.434 --> 03:59.489
Oh, my God, Rosie's
gone into hospital. Oh.

03:59.899 --> 04:01.743
Is that now? I thought
she was months away.

04:03.112 --> 04:05.131
But Danny's with her. He
says I've got to tell Gran.

04:05.155 --> 04:09.150
I could go. I could get a
taxi, it's only half an hour.

04:09.315 --> 04:10.683
Oh, don't add to
the panic, Gran.

04:10.708 --> 04:12.908
The last thing we need is
one of your little adventures.

04:13.256 --> 04:15.616
Danny says she's having
an ultrasound for the epidural,

04:15.641 --> 04:16.872
so everything's fine.

04:17.168 --> 04:18.607
Your mother would be there.

04:19.180 --> 04:20.200
I know, but...

04:21.423 --> 04:23.264
Yeah, but there's nothing
we can do about that.

04:23.517 --> 04:25.168
It's a bit odd for Daniel,

04:25.439 --> 04:27.739
childbirth with his own sister.

04:28.372 --> 04:30.676
If he wasn't gay
before, he will be now.

04:30.701 --> 04:32.066
Well, that's gynaephobic.

04:32.870 --> 04:33.894
What was that?

04:34.469 --> 04:35.800
Celeste says hello.

04:36.112 --> 04:37.182
Mm.

04:37.901 --> 04:39.695
Well, let me know the news.

04:39.696 --> 04:40.908
Any time.

04:41.158 --> 04:42.675
Even if it's 4am.

04:42.700 --> 04:45.571
I will but don't
stay up all night.

04:45.596 --> 04:47.931
Promise me, no adventures.

04:48.013 --> 04:50.641
You talk to me like I'm a child.

04:55.137 --> 04:57.616
If you go to bed
now, get up at 5am,

04:57.937 --> 05:01.109
drive to Manchester, you could
be at your gran's by eight o'clock.

05:01.476 --> 05:04.196
But I've got Lou Havins coming
round in the morning about that trust.

05:04.369 --> 05:05.662
Cancel him.

05:06.244 --> 05:07.283
E-mail him now, go on.

05:07.605 --> 05:08.811
Family emergency.

05:09.530 --> 05:11.982
You should be with
your gran, the old goat.

05:15.877 --> 05:17.184
Don't ever tell her I was nice.

05:19.489 --> 05:21.269
This is BBC Radio 4.

05:21.294 --> 05:22.504
Good morning.

05:22.862 --> 05:25.286
Researchers have to
carry out a 5-year study

05:25.311 --> 05:27.689
into the causes of
inequality in the UK

05:27.721 --> 05:29.909
which, they say, is a
threat to democracy.

05:30.489 --> 05:33.283
Theresa May's Brexit
negotiator is going to Brussels

05:33.308 --> 05:35.191
for talks on the
document that sets out

05:35.216 --> 05:37.745
the UK's future
relations with the EU.

05:38.272 --> 05:40.638
Doris Day appears on
most of the front pages

05:40.663 --> 05:43.475
following her death
yesterday at the age of 97.

05:54.055 --> 05:55.196
He's so Chinese.

05:55.221 --> 05:56.931
Oh, my God, I was
waiting for you to say it first.

05:56.955 --> 05:57.978
He is, isn't he?

05:58.346 --> 06:02.360
I was wondering how Chinese he
was going to be but he is, like, 100%.

06:02.781 --> 06:04.367
Tiny little version of Gau.

06:04.890 --> 06:06.194
Well, you'll have to tell him.

06:06.267 --> 06:07.600
I know, I'll call him later.

06:08.349 --> 06:09.372
What about Dad?

06:09.529 --> 06:10.624
None of his business.

06:11.866 --> 06:12.986
Do you want me to phone him?

06:13.516 --> 06:15.451
If I want to tell anyone,
I want to tell Mum...

06:16.091 --> 06:18.036
and I can't, so Dad
can just piss off.

06:18.841 --> 06:20.136
Don't you tell him, okay?

06:20.161 --> 06:21.442
- Have you got that?
- Okay, okay.

06:21.466 --> 06:23.230
All right. I won't.

06:24.965 --> 06:26.815
So, have you thought of a name?

06:27.882 --> 06:28.882
Lincoln.

06:29.530 --> 06:32.260
I don't believe it, she's
calling him Lincoln.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.939
Like Abraham Lincoln?

06:34.150 --> 06:36.188
What is he, a Chinese
Abraham Lincoln?

06:36.306 --> 06:39.345
You're saying
Lincoln, Lincoln Lyons.

06:39.555 --> 06:40.735
She's calling him Lincoln.

06:40.899 --> 06:43.383
I know. I got an
e-mail from Danny.

06:43.666 --> 06:46.102
I warn you, he'll
get called Lin.

06:46.519 --> 06:48.171
Gran says he'll get called Lin.

06:48.196 --> 06:50.843
So? Tell her that's
a boy's name too.

06:51.375 --> 06:53.351
There's nothing wrong with it. I
just wonder where she got it from.

06:53.375 --> 06:55.124
Maybe she had sex in Lincoln.

06:55.149 --> 06:56.397
Oi, that's enough of that.

06:57.478 --> 06:59.509
Ruby says maybe
she had sex in Lincoln.

06:59.566 --> 07:01.404
Er, tell Ruby to
stop being so rude.

07:01.623 --> 07:03.356
All right, I'd better
go. I'll see you tonight.

07:03.380 --> 07:05.037
Congratulations, again.

07:05.302 --> 07:06.568
Great grandmother.

07:06.662 --> 07:09.200
I am great, don't you forget it.

07:10.567 --> 07:12.817
Come on, let's go
and see the little swine.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.917
Mr Lincoln Lyons.

07:17.206 --> 07:18.324
You've got a new cousin.

07:18.649 --> 07:20.440
Auntie Rosie had a
little boy called Lincoln,

07:20.507 --> 07:21.539
like Lincoln Green.

07:24.656 --> 07:27.290
Signor, give me the origin of
Lincoln as a boy's first name.

07:27.315 --> 07:28.955
Lincoln as a boy's first name

07:28.980 --> 07:30.595
is from the Latin meaning lithe.

07:30.631 --> 07:31.831
What does lithe mean?

07:31.980 --> 07:33.714
Erm, kind of thin.

07:34.281 --> 07:35.580
Is it thin or slight?

07:35.670 --> 07:36.869
More like slim.

07:37.399 --> 07:39.447
Signor, what does lithe mean?

07:39.540 --> 07:43.546
Lithe, adjective meaning
pliant, limber, supple, flexible.

07:43.571 --> 07:44.603
Thank you.

07:48.035 --> 07:50.030
Hello, hello, hello.

07:50.111 --> 07:53.727
- Aw, he's fast asleep.
- Good boy.

07:53.891 --> 07:56.397
Oh, little Lincoln.

07:58.086 --> 07:59.905
I keep thinking about your mum.

08:00.192 --> 08:02.818
I know. But don't
set me off again.

08:03.289 --> 08:04.360
Has anyone told Edith?

08:04.975 --> 08:07.107
I left her a message.
She never replies.

08:07.171 --> 08:08.177
God knows where she is.

08:08.225 --> 08:10.950
Indonesia, last I heard.

08:11.621 --> 08:13.950
They imprison
children, she says.

08:14.011 --> 08:16.137
Apparently, if you haven't
got a birth certificate,

08:16.652 --> 08:19.574
they determine your
age by x-raying your wrist

08:19.620 --> 08:24.050
and then if your X-ray says you're
16, you're 16 even if you're 12.

08:24.159 --> 08:27.612
So, off goes Edith into battle.

08:28.670 --> 08:30.080
Just like her mother.

08:30.465 --> 08:32.924
No, Mum liked a hot
bath and proper towels.

08:32.948 --> 08:34.438
Edith lives like a hippy.

08:35.557 --> 08:37.628
Come on, then, they
said two to a bed.

08:37.804 --> 08:39.251
I'll take Lee to McDonald's.

08:39.275 --> 08:41.578
- How do you fancy that, yeah?
- Yeah!

08:41.664 --> 08:43.857
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

08:44.843 --> 08:45.910
Can I say goodbye?

08:46.147 --> 08:47.147
Yeah.

08:48.418 --> 08:49.842
Oh, careful.

08:50.820 --> 08:53.451
Oh, looking a bit broody there.

08:53.775 --> 08:55.473
No chance. No way.

08:55.676 --> 08:57.224
Ah, you'd be great,
you and Ralph.

08:57.407 --> 09:00.075
Don't know if I could have
a kid in a world like this.

09:00.199 --> 09:03.285
- Oh, that's happy, thanks.
- Really, though. It's...

09:04.289 --> 09:05.987
It is like that Rook woman said,

09:06.519 --> 09:08.875
things were OK a few
years ago, before 2008.

09:08.900 --> 09:11.420
Do you remember back then?
We used to think politics was boring.

09:11.616 --> 09:12.639
Those were the days.

09:12.664 --> 09:14.712
But now, I worry
about everything.

09:15.147 --> 09:16.431
I don't know what
to worry about first.

09:16.455 --> 09:18.563
Never mind the government,
it's the sodding banks.

09:18.588 --> 09:20.555
They terrify me and
it's not even them,

09:20.580 --> 09:23.421
it's the companies, the
brands, the corporations.

09:23.626 --> 09:24.851
They treat us like algorithms,

09:24.876 --> 09:27.179
while they go around poisoning
the air and the temperature

09:27.204 --> 09:29.255
and the rain, and don't
even start me on Isis.

09:29.814 --> 09:31.303
Well, now we've got America.

09:31.686 --> 09:33.872
Never thought I'd be scared
of America in a million years,

09:33.896 --> 09:35.959
but we've got fake
news and false facts

09:35.984 --> 09:37.249
and I don't even know
what's true any more.

09:37.273 --> 09:39.318
What sort of world are we in?

09:40.115 --> 09:44.145
'Cos if it's this bad now, what's
it going to be like for you, huh?

09:44.170 --> 09:47.489
30 years' time,
10 years, 5 years?

10:16.004 --> 10:18.010
Okay, right, so don't laugh,

10:18.482 --> 10:19.642

10:19.865 --> 10:21.532
Oh, my God,
you're hilarious, Dan.

10:21.557 --> 10:22.584
But will you though?

10:22.796 --> 10:24.807
- Yes!
- Yeah?

10:34.731 --> 10:37.845
And China has named the
new island Hong Sha Dao,

10:37.870 --> 10:39.889
which means the
Island of the Red Sands.

It's about time,

10:47.662 --> 10:50.878
but I'll be standing as
an independent candidate.

10:50.961 --> 10:53.277

The Ukrainian Army has

Let's call it the Winter Feast.

12:05.360 --> 12:08.995
And with Germany still in mourning
after the death of Angela Merkel...

12:09.028 --> 12:11.234
- Oh, good riddance.
- What?

12:11.259 --> 12:12.967
Well, you know, I
don't want to be rude,

12:12.992 --> 12:14.772

got a whole lot prettier.

12:14.797 --> 12:16.860
You've got a great

12:17.595 --> 12:20.780
Why is she even
on? She's not anyone.

- She's no-one.
- Oh, lighten up!

12:23.322 --> 12:25.187
I'll take it as a
compliment, anyway.

12:25.212 --> 12:26.697
And here's to absent friends,

12:26.722 --> 12:30.267
to our dearly beloved sister,
out there on the oceans deep.

12:30.636 --> 12:32.660
- Here's to Edith.
- To Edith!

12:34.596 --> 12:36.354
Yeah!

12:42.215 --> 12:44.447
And there's a large
crowd of protesters

12:44.472 --> 12:46.189
gathering in Dover this morning,

12:46.214 --> 12:49.179
as it's been announced
that so far in 2024,

12:49.204 --> 12:52.180
more Ukrainian refugees
have entered the UK

12:52.205 --> 12:54.093
than in the whole
of the previous year.

12:54.250 --> 12:57.609
Current estimates suggest
that a further 10,000 refugees

12:57.634 --> 12:59.984
will be arriving before
the end of the month.

13:01.699 --> 13:02.699
Pass me the soap.

13:05.583 --> 13:06.703
What are you doing that for?

13:07.366 --> 13:09.050
I just had a shit downstairs.

13:09.676 --> 13:11.574
You always tell me off
when I run the tap, so...

13:11.599 --> 13:12.894
Hey, have you got shitty hands?!

13:12.919 --> 13:14.929
I haven't got actual
shit on my hands, no.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.057
Don't. Get off. Stop it!

13:17.082 --> 13:18.309
All right. I'm done.

13:19.114 --> 13:21.149
- That's disgusting.
- It was your rule.

13:22.862 --> 13:23.871
Morning.

13:24.371 --> 13:25.517
Oh, you look nice.

13:27.019 --> 13:28.097
Hello, Clyde.

13:28.833 --> 13:30.410
Stephen, I left that
thing on the shelf.

13:30.434 --> 13:32.331
- Don't forget, it needs to go today.
- Yep.

13:32.703 --> 13:34.393
Tell me, Clyde, are
you living here now?

13:34.535 --> 13:35.831
Mum says thank you very much.

13:35.856 --> 13:38.003
That's every day this
week, I'll send her a bill.

13:38.714 --> 13:41.058
- Morning.
- Hello, Mummy.

13:41.088 --> 13:43.954
- And how's Bethany doing under there?
- She's fine! Hm.

13:44.042 --> 13:46.556
Well, it would be nice to see
her one day. Give her my love.

13:46.581 --> 13:49.344
Signor, remind Edith it's
Gran's birthday on the second.

13:49.369 --> 13:52.147
Reminder to Edith Lyons sent.

13:52.172 --> 13:53.945
God, the Winter Feast.

13:54.172 --> 13:55.319
Do we really have to go?

13:55.450 --> 13:57.225
Don't be daft, we'll
have a nice time.

13:57.882 --> 13:59.962
Plus it means we don't have
to see them at Christmas.

14:00.203 --> 14:02.701
OK, nobody can use the
Vision tonight 'cos me and Clyde

14:02.726 --> 14:05.721
have booked it, we've got
upstairs from seven till ten,

14:05.746 --> 14:07.757
- have you got that?
- Clyde and I.

14:07.852 --> 14:10.016
It's the worldwide
premier of Guardians 4

14:10.041 --> 14:12.088
so you can't interrupt,
not for anything.

14:12.113 --> 14:14.032
No, Chris Pratt is
such a hot daddy.

14:14.057 --> 14:15.829
He could have me any day.

14:17.484 --> 14:19.423
- Bye!
- 13 years old.

14:21.529 --> 14:23.953
Bethany says she's
booked us for Saturday.

14:24.911 --> 14:25.911
Are you free?

14:26.996 --> 14:28.308
Bethany, sweetheart,

14:28.754 --> 14:30.554
you don't need to make
an appointment with me.

14:30.672 --> 14:32.861
I'm here, right in front of you.

14:33.378 --> 14:34.827
I'm sorry, Mummy.

14:34.852 --> 14:37.830
Seriously though, I mean, I might
have to start limiting filter time.

14:37.831 --> 14:38.931
Just talk to me properly.

14:39.161 --> 14:41.581
- Sorry, pretty Mummy.
- Do you want me to take that off you?

14:41.606 --> 14:43.668
- Don't, no, it's all right.
- No, it's not.

14:43.858 --> 14:45.183
It's not all right.

14:45.728 --> 14:48.190
Beth, I'm here, in front of you.

14:48.850 --> 14:51.744
If you want to talk to us, you
don't need to make an appointment.

14:53.065 --> 14:57.092
Why don't you turn off that
filter, so we can see you properly?

14:58.856 --> 15:00.329
Sorry.

15:01.409 --> 15:02.790
For God's sakes.

15:03.080 --> 15:05.802
I think if Beth wants to see
us then Saturday makes sense

15:05.827 --> 15:07.242
because you won't be rushing off

15:07.267 --> 15:09.578
and Ruby's at her
sex-fighting class,

15:09.602 --> 15:11.687
so the three of us can sit down
together and have a nice long chat,

15:11.711 --> 15:14.825
- isn't that right, Beth?
- Oh, I like how that became my fault.

15:14.850 --> 15:15.898
Rushing off.

15:16.794 --> 15:18.663
But, yes, OK, fine. Saturday.

15:18.712 --> 15:23.224
Yaaaay! Fank-oo! Fank-oo!

15:46.630 --> 15:47.768
You not got your car?

15:49.108 --> 15:50.650
Oh, I was in
Rusholme last night,

15:50.675 --> 15:52.947
it was all sealed off
with that bomb factory.

15:52.972 --> 15:55.132
- I've got to go and get it.
- Well, I can take you in.

15:55.769 --> 15:57.291
It's about time we said hello.

15:57.919 --> 16:00.267
It's Daniel, from number 17.

16:00.839 --> 16:02.002
I'm Fran.

16:02.847 --> 16:04.510
- Fran Baxter.
- Hi.

16:05.602 --> 16:06.855
Thank you.

16:08.781 --> 16:10.181
So, what brought
you up here, then?

16:10.501 --> 16:12.393
Oh, I gave up on
London in the end.

16:12.617 --> 16:14.632
I tried my best, but
it finally beat me.

16:14.750 --> 16:17.974
- Why, too expensive?
- £12 for a coffee.

16:18.688 --> 16:20.389
And those areas
getting fenced off,

16:20.414 --> 16:23.242
like you can only enter
Kensington if you're means tested.

16:23.776 --> 16:26.045
I thought, I've had enough.
I can do my job anywhere.

16:26.070 --> 16:28.256
- Which is what, what do you do?
- I'm a story teller.

16:29.757 --> 16:31.647
Oh, right, good. Yeah.

16:32.648 --> 16:36.053
- What's that?
- I tell stories for a living.

16:36.078 --> 16:38.068
I go into schools
and businesses.

16:38.093 --> 16:39.388
I teach master classes.

16:39.739 --> 16:43.044
The shape of stories
and the need for them.

16:44.273 --> 16:47.551
- You think it's ridiculous, don't you?
- Uh, no. No, not at all.

16:47.714 --> 16:49.552
It's a real thing,
though. It's worldwide.

16:49.577 --> 16:51.759
- I've done a TED talk.
- Oh, God. Wow.

16:51.784 --> 16:54.767
Well, TEDx, but it's
amazing in schools.

16:54.823 --> 16:56.005
Kids love it.

16:56.145 --> 17:00.012
Like, stories help them to
make sense of the world.

17:02.953 --> 17:05.339
Is your sister Edith Lyons?

17:06.711 --> 17:08.691
Yes, yes, she is. Yeah.

17:09.194 --> 17:11.041
You'd get on well with
her, she'd love you.

17:11.233 --> 17:12.821
Why, how do you know? Who said?

17:13.060 --> 17:15.518
Mike at number 12 told me.

17:16.811 --> 17:18.079
I think she's amazing.

17:18.588 --> 17:20.306
I've read all of her books.

17:20.367 --> 17:21.643
Er, well, they're
not exactly books,

17:21.666 --> 17:23.540
they're more like
essays that never end.

17:24.532 --> 17:27.211
No, but, yeah, and you know
I haven't seen her for years.

17:27.236 --> 17:28.956
She didn't even come
home when our mum died.

17:29.101 --> 17:33.088
She's in Lagos
now, causing trouble.

17:34.089 --> 17:37.241
Hm. And you work
for the council, yeah?

17:37.378 --> 17:39.467
Yeah, I'm just a
housing officer.

17:39.577 --> 17:41.577
I know. Boring.

17:43.482 --> 17:45.365
I'm dealing with
all these refugees.

17:45.519 --> 17:46.807
They're flooding
in from Ukraine.

17:46.831 --> 17:49.927
500 in the past month,
housing doesn't cover it,

17:49.952 --> 17:51.903
we've had to build
them a little town.

17:52.408 --> 17:56.507
No. No! No, no, cars on site.

17:56.532 --> 18:00.019
Read the signs. Parking's
at Denholm Fields.

18:00.044 --> 18:01.773
Well, I don't know
where that is.

18:02.119 --> 18:03.166
I'm Debbie Green.

18:03.426 --> 18:06.537
They sent me from Blackpool.
I'm with the exchange.

18:06.788 --> 18:08.827
OK. Well, just go back
to the road, turn right,

18:08.828 --> 18:11.397
follow the parking signs and
then come back and find me,

18:11.422 --> 18:13.350
Daniel Lyons, and I can
show you what's what.

18:13.686 --> 18:14.686
Thanks, Danny.

18:14.970 --> 18:15.974
Daniel.

18:17.439 --> 18:21.380
So, they arrive here and they're
sent through there to Divestiture.

18:21.405 --> 18:23.408
That's where they
abandon all their belongings,

18:23.433 --> 18:25.107
except clothes and essentials,

18:25.132 --> 18:27.442
because you would not
believe what they try to bring in,

18:27.562 --> 18:30.004
chairs and heirlooms, pets.

18:30.029 --> 18:33.254
We keep saying, "They're not
homes, they're emergency housing."

18:33.279 --> 18:35.621
- How many on site?
- 60 so far,

18:35.760 --> 18:37.699
but expanding to 200
by the end of the week.

18:37.772 --> 18:38.912
Yeah, so what's the
plan with Blackpool?

18:38.936 --> 18:40.917
- Are you building one of these?
- Oh, God, no.

18:41.114 --> 18:42.914
- I'm trying to stop them.
- What do you mean?

18:43.286 --> 18:46.305
Oh, we don't want this.
It's a bloody nightmare.

18:46.383 --> 18:48.777
- I voted Leave.
- Yeah, they're not immigrants.

18:48.802 --> 18:50.546
They're refugees.
There's a difference.

18:50.571 --> 18:51.571
Do you know what
the difference is?

18:51.572 --> 18:55.693
I think it's one thing taking in
starving kids, but not Ukrainians!

18:55.928 --> 18:59.272
They've got shops over there,
they've got TV, they've got roads.

18:59.297 --> 19:00.792
They've got soldiers
on the streets.

19:00.817 --> 19:02.208
Are we at war with Russia?

19:02.503 --> 19:03.630
No, not yet.

19:03.655 --> 19:05.146
Then they're not refugees.

19:05.252 --> 19:06.658
They're asylum seekers,

19:06.955 --> 19:09.180
and that's a very different
apple in the custard.

19:09.513 --> 19:12.852
97% of Ukraine voted
for Russian citizenship.

19:13.301 --> 19:14.766
If you can believe
that wasn't fixed,

19:14.790 --> 19:16.859
and now Russia's got
the names of the other 3%,

19:16.884 --> 19:17.985
whether that's legal or not,

19:18.009 --> 19:19.664
and they're talking
about re-housing them

19:20.219 --> 19:22.530
but they won't give a definition
of what re-housing means,

19:22.555 --> 19:24.741
which is terrifying, frankly.

19:24.766 --> 19:27.295
In other words, it's a purge,
so these people are refugees

19:27.320 --> 19:29.037
which means they're
allowed to seek asylum

19:29.062 --> 19:30.564
and it's got nothing
to do with Europe

19:30.588 --> 19:34.060
and we're still part of the United
Nations, whether you like it or not.

19:34.252 --> 19:37.192
- Who says apple in the custard?
- My mother.

19:37.217 --> 19:40.188
- Then she's a bloody idiot.
- Vijay, get her off site.

19:40.707 --> 19:41.789
- June.
- Yeah?

19:41.814 --> 19:43.837
- That's for DP. Thank you.
- Thanks.

19:44.093 --> 19:45.354
15.15.

19:45.693 --> 19:47.979
Right. Er, hi there.

19:48.004 --> 19:49.478
Mr Barabash.

19:49.503 --> 19:54.970
Er, you've applied for a
transfer to Dublin because...

19:55.808 --> 19:57.768
Oh, you've got family
there, is that right? Sorry.

19:58.741 --> 20:00.235
- How's your English?
- It's good.

20:00.424 --> 20:02.631
OK. Well, we can't process
that until the sanctuary scheme

20:02.655 --> 20:04.295
has worked out a
border deal with Ireland,

20:04.319 --> 20:07.216
and that is a long way off so
we can't do anything right now.

20:07.318 --> 20:10.675
- Sorry.
- Good, but, er, I'm not Mr Barabash.

20:12.630 --> 20:13.630
Oh.

20:14.390 --> 20:17.003
- Right. okay. Is he around?
- No, he's gone.

20:18.163 --> 20:20.092
- Where has he gone?
- Dublin.

20:20.912 --> 20:23.606
Er, well, I'm here
to tell him he can't.

20:24.138 --> 20:25.350
That bastard.

20:27.611 --> 20:29.840
My name is Viktor.
Viktor Goraya.

20:30.372 --> 20:33.355
Yeah, I should know that,
shouldn't I? Er, well, I'm with housing.

20:33.380 --> 20:37.089
Daniel, I'm... Yeah, I'm normally
more efficient than this, promise.

20:37.276 --> 20:38.556
I thought you'd come to join me.

20:38.719 --> 20:39.917
They said I'd have to share.

20:40.512 --> 20:42.331
I thought, "Wow,
I've got lucky."

20:45.983 --> 20:47.471
Yeah, anyway, I'd better...

20:49.136 --> 20:50.174
Thanks.

20:50.852 --> 20:52.251
So, how are you settling in?

20:52.974 --> 20:55.290
They got me a
lawyer, Mrs Vennering.

20:55.596 --> 20:57.430
She prepares my case for asylum.

20:57.941 --> 21:00.344
It'll take months, so
thank you for my home.

21:00.879 --> 21:04.124
Oh, well, it's meant to have proper
insulation, but the money ran out.

21:04.677 --> 21:07.015
The roof's only made of
a light gauge steel, so...

21:08.351 --> 21:10.412
Sorry, I could talk
about containers forever.

21:11.174 --> 21:13.498
My boyfriend,
oh, gets sick of it.

21:14.006 --> 21:15.042
Yeah.

21:18.389 --> 21:19.684
So, what does your lawyer say?

21:20.029 --> 21:22.231
I mean, what are your chances?

21:22.464 --> 21:24.801
Well, they need
to prove torture,

21:25.094 --> 21:26.118
that I was tortured.

21:27.508 --> 21:28.531
They asked me questions

21:28.556 --> 21:30.516
and applied electricity
to the soles of my feet.

21:30.842 --> 21:32.897
- I think that's torture.
- Of course it is.

21:33.797 --> 21:36.703
God, that's... That's
terrible, I'm so sorry.

21:36.930 --> 21:38.600
They demand
proof here in the UK,

21:38.935 --> 21:42.007
which I understand,
but they electrocute

21:42.032 --> 21:44.193
because it leaves
no marks, so no proof.

21:45.345 --> 21:49.333
You see, there was a tiny
scar where the electric goes in.

21:50.592 --> 21:51.614
But not any more.

21:52.653 --> 21:53.673
It fades away.

21:59.335 --> 22:00.379
Does it still hurt?

22:01.548 --> 22:03.324
Yeah, but it's okay.

22:10.605 --> 22:11.994
So, what did they ask you?

22:13.278 --> 22:14.337
What sort of questions?

22:14.792 --> 22:19.282
My friends, their names,
addresses, the bars we'd go to.

22:19.307 --> 22:20.384
But I thought...

22:21.281 --> 22:24.368
- It's legal in Ukraine, isn't it?
- No, no, no.

22:24.465 --> 22:25.850
Not with the new Russian laws.

22:26.273 --> 22:28.788
But the point is, the
inquisitors were Ukrainian.

22:30.202 --> 22:32.082
They were people who'd
been waiting a long time.

22:37.597 --> 22:38.597
That's nice.

22:42.106 --> 22:43.653
I'd better get back to work.

22:44.185 --> 22:45.189
Yeah.

22:50.585 --> 22:53.182
Well, say hello, any time.

22:53.735 --> 22:55.722
Er, yeah, but we're
not allowed to.

22:55.963 --> 22:57.770
It's preferential
treatment, you know?

22:58.960 --> 23:00.134
Anyway, thanks.

23:15.128 --> 23:17.867
Signor, give me Bethany's
internet history, past 24 hours.

23:18.066 --> 23:19.530
That account is private.

23:19.920 --> 23:21.358
Germany Lemon Five Parasol.

23:21.452 --> 23:22.452
Unlocked.

23:22.477 --> 23:23.480
Don't.

23:24.097 --> 23:25.105
We promised them.

23:27.040 --> 23:29.427
Signor, give me Bethany's
internet history, past 24 hours.

23:31.699 --> 23:32.974
A trans life?

23:33.639 --> 23:34.864
Well, there we are.

23:35.820 --> 23:36.868
I said so.

23:47.010 --> 23:48.159
Oh, bless her.

23:48.846 --> 23:49.917
It's okay.

23:50.504 --> 23:51.504
She'll be fine.

23:52.543 --> 23:53.543
He'll be fine.

23:54.568 --> 23:55.603
They'll be fine?

23:58.966 --> 24:00.056
Oh, God.

24:05.263 --> 24:06.719
I just want you to know...

24:08.763 --> 24:10.468
I wuv you, Mummy and Daddy.

24:11.835 --> 24:13.427
I know you do, sweetheart.

24:14.210 --> 24:16.090
And I'm going to ask
you to take the filter off.

24:16.480 --> 24:17.613
Will you do that for me?

24:30.855 --> 24:31.855
I think...

24:33.393 --> 24:34.852
I've been uncomfortable...

24:36.086 --> 24:37.125
a very long time.

24:37.188 --> 24:38.538
- We know.
- Sh, sh.

24:40.257 --> 24:43.218
I've been thinking, ever
since I was born, that...

24:45.401 --> 24:46.960
I don't belong in this body.

24:49.068 --> 24:50.872
- Oh, my God.
- It's all right.

24:51.237 --> 24:52.892
It's really okay, darling.

24:55.673 --> 24:58.766
I've been reading
up on it and...

25:02.562 --> 25:03.803
I think I'm trans.

25:04.434 --> 25:06.469
Oh, sweetheart. Aw.

25:06.767 --> 25:09.944
Oh, it's all right,
darling. I swear.

25:10.194 --> 25:11.655
It really is.

25:12.300 --> 25:15.443
Ah, look at us, we're fine.
We're completely fine, aren't we?

25:15.468 --> 25:16.468
Mm-hm.

25:17.162 --> 25:20.873
And I know we might be a
bit slow and a bit old and...

25:22.079 --> 25:23.673
this is going to
be confusing for us

25:23.697 --> 25:25.721
and we'll make a mess
of it sometimes, but...

25:26.965 --> 25:28.449
we love you. Hm?

25:28.885 --> 25:31.495
We love you. We
absolutely love you.

25:31.964 --> 25:33.065
We always will.

25:33.839 --> 25:36.525
I mean, we don't need to rush.

25:36.691 --> 25:38.798
We've got lots of time to...

25:39.519 --> 25:40.550
talk about this.

25:40.762 --> 25:43.151
And, you know, if it turns
out that we've got a...

25:43.248 --> 25:47.647
a lovely son instead of a lovely
daughter then, well, we'll be happy.

25:48.872 --> 25:50.867
No, I'm not transsexual.

25:52.043 --> 25:53.684
- Oh.
- Is that not the word now?

25:54.004 --> 25:55.691
But you said trans.

25:55.716 --> 25:57.058
What do we call you, then?

25:57.665 --> 26:00.589
I'm not transsexual,
I'm transhuman.

26:01.026 --> 26:02.026
Oh, okay.

26:02.051 --> 26:04.029
I'm sorry, they keep
changing the words.

26:04.220 --> 26:05.365
I don't know the difference.

26:05.390 --> 26:07.193
I don't want to change sex.

26:07.295 --> 26:10.075
No, sure. We say gender
now, don't we? I'm sorry.

26:10.749 --> 26:13.161
I said I'm not
comfortable with my body,

26:13.405 --> 26:14.927
so I want to get rid of it.

26:15.177 --> 26:16.184
This thing,

26:16.879 --> 26:18.918
all the arms and legs
and every single bit of it.

26:19.293 --> 26:21.121
I don't want to be flesh.

26:21.828 --> 26:24.729
I'm really sorry, but I'm
going to escape this thing

26:25.215 --> 26:26.346
and become digital.

26:28.266 --> 26:29.534
What do you mean?

26:29.880 --> 26:33.471
They say one day soon, they'll
have clinics in Switzerland,

26:33.496 --> 26:35.729
where you can go
and you'll sign a form

26:35.754 --> 26:39.852
and they'll take your brain
and download it into the cloud.

26:40.997 --> 26:42.032
And your body?

26:42.494 --> 26:43.515
Recycled...

26:44.572 --> 26:45.672
into the Earth.

26:46.407 --> 26:48.419
So, you want to kill yourself?

26:50.172 --> 26:53.108
I want to live forever
as information,

26:53.133 --> 26:55.319
because that's what
transhumans are, Mum.

26:55.418 --> 26:57.456
Not male or female...

26:57.730 --> 26:58.761
better.

26:59.386 --> 27:02.254
Where I'm going there's no
life or death, there's only data.

27:02.889 --> 27:04.596
I will be data.

27:07.793 --> 27:10.081
You promised me! You liars!

27:12.019 --> 27:15.267
And if you think you're going
online, you make a sad mistake.

27:15.376 --> 27:16.884
I'm switching it off!

27:17.109 --> 27:18.702
I will go analogue if I have to,

27:18.727 --> 27:20.665
so you can't read
any more of that shit!

27:24.916 --> 27:29.793
Then the old woman clung to her
daughter, because she was so afraid.

27:30.373 --> 27:33.808
She said, "My daughter,
I can't go home."

27:34.311 --> 27:36.700
"Waiting on the road,
out there in the night,"

27:36.725 --> 27:39.135
"are three terrible creatures."

27:39.485 --> 27:44.619
"There is a tiger, there is
a bear and there is a wolf"

27:44.644 --> 27:47.157
"and they will eat me."

27:48.009 --> 27:53.680
But the daughter said, "Look,
what about the pumpkin?"

27:54.154 --> 27:57.414
'Cos she still had the pumpkin
shell from making the pumpkin soup,

27:57.439 --> 27:59.507
and the pumpkin shell was huge.

27:59.697 --> 28:04.163
She said, "Mother,
get inside the pumpkin."

28:04.701 --> 28:10.209
So the old woman did and as
she bent over and curled up tight,

28:10.542 --> 28:14.357
all the bones in
her back went crick!

28:14.433 --> 28:15.472
Crack!

28:15.614 --> 28:17.341
- Crick!
- Crack!

28:17.367 --> 28:19.268
- Crrrr-ick!
- Crack!

28:19.293 --> 28:23.373
Oh, those old bones.

28:24.146 --> 28:26.325
But the old woman got inside,

28:27.373 --> 28:30.505
and her daughter sealed up
the pumpkin with candle wax

28:30.530 --> 28:32.402
and rolled her to the door.

28:38.336 --> 28:39.745
I'd better go home.

28:40.711 --> 28:41.752
Stay.

28:44.925 --> 28:45.956
Sorry.

29:18.712 --> 29:19.712
Two ticks.

29:20.645 --> 29:21.645
It's okay.

30:06.120 --> 30:08.998
- Hiya. It's Tony, isn't it?
- That's right.

30:09.397 --> 30:12.306
I'm Lee's mum,
Rosie. Rosie Lyons.

30:14.478 --> 30:17.031
There's no Mr Lyons, in
case you were wondering.

30:18.914 --> 30:20.828
And so she ran off, overnight.

30:21.395 --> 30:22.835
Literally packed
her bags and left.

30:23.449 --> 30:26.077
Milly was only four and I
had to cope all on my own.

30:26.680 --> 30:28.937
Well, I hope you're not
expecting a medal, single dad.

30:29.108 --> 30:30.108
No.

30:30.323 --> 30:31.358
I was just saying.

30:31.991 --> 30:33.210
God, you're hard work.

30:33.276 --> 30:34.397
Yes, I am.

30:34.570 --> 30:35.608
Get used to it.

30:37.086 --> 30:39.756
So who have you
got? Lincoln and Lee.

30:39.919 --> 30:41.985
Yep. His dad's called Gau.

30:42.470 --> 30:45.794
He was nice enough, but he went
back home to Beijing when his mum died.

30:45.926 --> 30:47.630
She fell off a
roof, it was terrible.

30:48.340 --> 30:50.687
Although, I always knew
he'd go back in the end.

30:50.712 --> 30:51.792
He was never going to stay.

30:52.618 --> 30:55.276
And Lee's dad is a
man called Terry Malone.

30:55.535 --> 30:58.018
He's living in Slough with
a wife and three daughters.

30:58.182 --> 30:59.706
He stays in touch,
he sends money.

31:00.425 --> 31:01.831
We first got together at school.

31:02.416 --> 31:03.659
I don't mean
childhood sweethearts,

31:03.683 --> 31:06.914
it was more of a school
disco sort of thing.

31:08.666 --> 31:11.290
So, er, do you work or
are these two full-time?

31:11.556 --> 31:13.681
God, no. I've got a job.

31:13.954 --> 31:16.094
I'd go crackers stuck at
home with two boys all day.

31:17.124 --> 31:19.069
- What do you do?
- I'm a championship wrestler.

31:19.751 --> 31:20.751
What?

31:21.796 --> 31:24.686
No, I'm a chef manager, on
a job share at the big school.

31:24.711 --> 31:26.537
1,200 pupils.

31:26.674 --> 31:27.721
It's hard work.

31:28.448 --> 31:32.028
So, Mr Tony Watts, now you know
everything, you can ask me out.

31:32.376 --> 31:34.465
Oh, right, can I?

31:34.568 --> 31:36.003
Yes, you can. Hurry up!

31:36.595 --> 31:38.839
All right, well, erm,
well, what do you fancy?

31:38.902 --> 31:40.613
Saturday night, does that work?

31:40.910 --> 31:42.519
Can you cook? I can cook.

31:42.587 --> 31:44.495
No, you spend all
day in a canteen.

31:45.536 --> 31:47.643
I'll cook. I'll do it.

31:49.160 --> 31:50.689
Well, give me
your address, then.

31:51.683 --> 31:52.683
Okay.

31:53.373 --> 31:54.989
Saturday night, eight?

31:55.449 --> 31:56.582
Eight o'clock it is.

32:02.082 --> 32:05.550
Here we are, my beanie boys.

32:06.184 --> 32:08.191
I'll make you a bacon
sandwich later on.

32:08.216 --> 32:09.441
Beautiful, that'll do me.

32:09.635 --> 32:10.635
Thanks, Mur.

32:11.940 --> 32:13.671
I've been in that
back bedroom, Gran.

32:13.696 --> 32:15.690
I can't paint it, it's too
damp from the outside.

32:15.715 --> 32:17.175
You're going to need
proper work done in there.

32:17.199 --> 32:20.425
Zinc! You just cover
it over with zinc paint.

32:20.450 --> 32:23.167
I know, but that's not an
option. This house needs money.

32:23.192 --> 32:24.557
It's held together by cobwebs.

32:24.690 --> 32:25.712
We'll manage.

32:26.201 --> 32:27.682
All will be well.

32:28.193 --> 32:29.705
Don't let me interrupt.

32:30.017 --> 32:32.681
You look very nice
in dungarees, Ralph.

32:33.137 --> 32:34.164
Sexy.

32:34.517 --> 32:36.368
Oh, you cheeky thing!

32:40.433 --> 32:42.438
You do actually look
quite hot in dungarees.

32:45.128 --> 32:46.905
Well, er, we can try
'em at home, hm?

32:48.448 --> 32:50.416
- Later.
- Yeah, that'd be nice.

32:52.356 --> 32:53.414
It's about time.

32:54.650 --> 32:56.055
You're the one who works late.

32:56.080 --> 32:58.086
- Oh, forget I said anything.
- Well...

32:58.386 --> 33:00.409
You're the one who's
never off his phone.

33:00.457 --> 33:02.875
- Had to have the last word, didn't you?
- Well, it's true.

33:04.114 --> 33:05.800
Did you read that
link I sent you?

33:06.584 --> 33:08.839
- Er, no, not yet.
- You see?

33:09.144 --> 33:11.131
Look, I'm sharing
stuff, I'm trying.

33:11.947 --> 33:14.731
- You can join in more.
- Okay, what does it say?

33:14.845 --> 33:19.024
It's amazing, like, it's this site
that proves that germs don't exist.

33:19.278 --> 33:20.563
- Right.
- Yeah.

33:20.946 --> 33:21.961
That's what it says.

33:22.165 --> 33:23.512
No such thing as germs.

33:23.782 --> 33:26.931
Whole thing, right, faked by
the pharmaceutical industry.

33:26.956 --> 33:28.059
Right, well, that's bollocks.

33:28.083 --> 33:30.558
Don't do that, you'll be joining
the Flat Earth Society next.

33:30.621 --> 33:33.970
- Now that stuff is fascinating.
- Oh, no way.

33:34.103 --> 33:36.353
- Have you read it?
- No, and I never will.

33:36.378 --> 33:38.389
Come on, that's a bit
ignorant, don't you think?

33:38.498 --> 33:40.666
How's that going to help
anyone, not reading something?

33:40.736 --> 33:42.902
You're not saying the world
is flat, for God's sake, Ralph,

33:42.926 --> 33:45.462
you teach children, please
don't say the world is flat.

33:45.487 --> 33:46.868
I'm not saying it is,

33:47.153 --> 33:48.970
I'm just keeping an open mind.

33:49.925 --> 33:51.564
- It's an option.
- How?

33:52.070 --> 33:54.360
How is that an option?
We've been to India.

33:54.583 --> 33:56.250
We've travelled
halfway across the Earth.

33:56.360 --> 33:57.539
We've seen it.

33:58.081 --> 34:00.288
How do you think
the horizon curves?

34:00.313 --> 34:03.320
We've seen it from a
plane, there's a curve.

34:03.345 --> 34:04.745
That's what a disc
would look like.

34:04.795 --> 34:06.202
All right, well, you've
got GPS in your car.

34:06.226 --> 34:07.584
Yeah, with a flatscreen.

34:07.880 --> 34:10.505
The G stands for global.

34:10.531 --> 34:13.318
So? Apple computers aren't
made from apples, are they?

34:14.451 --> 34:16.068
That's not even a thi...

34:16.210 --> 34:18.427
Look, look, I'm not saying
I'm absolutely right, OK?

34:18.452 --> 34:20.504
Which means you can't
say I'm absolutely wrong.

34:20.702 --> 34:22.382
Except you're never
going to stop, are you?

34:22.628 --> 34:24.754
God help anyone trying
to contradict you, Dan!

34:29.034 --> 34:31.650
I swear to God, it's like
intelligence is going backwards.

34:31.676 --> 34:32.940
We're in reverse.

34:33.286 --> 34:37.306
If it's not the moon landings
or 9/11, it's, I don't know,

34:37.331 --> 34:39.033
the Loch Ness Monster!

34:39.813 --> 34:42.907
The human race is getting more
stupid right in front of our eyes.

34:42.931 --> 34:46.056
I mean, what do you do when
your husband is too thick?

34:46.710 --> 34:48.657
You can ask Celeste, she's
got a few theories about that.

34:48.681 --> 34:51.132
It's driving me mad. You
know, it's not just Ralph, it's...

34:51.420 --> 34:52.726
it's everywhere.

34:52.822 --> 34:53.853
I know.

34:54.386 --> 34:56.092
It's like we went too far.

34:57.190 --> 34:58.740
We imagined too much.

34:58.929 --> 35:01.645
We sent all those
probes into space

35:02.146 --> 35:04.403
and we went to the very
edge of the solar system,

35:04.655 --> 35:06.825
built the Hadron
Collider and the internet

35:07.161 --> 35:10.156
and we painted all those paintings
and we wrote all those great songs

35:10.181 --> 35:12.433
and then, pop!

35:14.074 --> 35:17.062
Whatever we had,
we punctured it.

35:18.219 --> 35:19.659
And now it's all collapsing.

35:21.576 --> 35:23.064
Well, nothing we can do.

35:24.080 --> 35:26.108
Our brains are devolving.

35:27.127 --> 35:28.547
Seriously, though,
what if they are?

35:28.571 --> 35:30.188
Well, some species
don't survive.

35:31.221 --> 35:33.430
Actually, all species
don't survive in the end.

35:33.962 --> 35:35.883
How can you say that with kids?

35:35.908 --> 35:37.039
Tell me about it.

35:37.926 --> 35:40.414
I've got a daughter who
wants to digitise herself

35:40.439 --> 35:43.373
and chuck her body
away. I don't know.

35:43.639 --> 35:44.960
Downloading your brain...

35:45.149 --> 35:48.123
It can't actually be done
though, can it? It's not real.

35:48.451 --> 35:50.654
- You're denying everything.
- Oh, God.

35:51.026 --> 35:52.693
What's real? What's not?

35:52.947 --> 35:54.068
How do we know?

35:54.775 --> 35:56.309
- You okay?
- Yeah.

35:57.346 --> 36:00.345
- Are you, though?
- It's just work.

36:01.306 --> 36:03.532
Are those Ukrainians
driving you mad?

36:04.352 --> 36:05.492
It's exactly that.

36:07.510 --> 36:10.086
Yes. That's exactly what it is.

36:12.637 --> 36:15.587
Ta-da! What do you
think? Am I gorgeous?

36:15.612 --> 36:17.659
Don't all clap at
once, thank you, fans.

36:17.660 --> 36:20.148
Stop faffing about. Head
off, you're going to be late.

36:20.173 --> 36:22.514
Right. Behave for
Lesley, you two.

36:22.539 --> 36:24.170
She's only on
three quid an hour.

36:26.028 --> 36:28.771
We've got popcorn and
Mike's universal password.

36:28.919 --> 36:30.060
We'll be fine.

36:30.085 --> 36:33.505
And if Mummy has a nice time
with her friend and talks too much

36:33.530 --> 36:37.590
and falls asleep on his couch,
uh, I'll see you in the morning.

36:38.084 --> 36:41.840
- Go Rosie!
- Bye-bye. Woo! Woo!

36:43.588 --> 36:45.462
Do you know, there wasn't
even a custody battle?

36:45.486 --> 36:47.153
- She was too drunk.
- Hm.

36:47.247 --> 36:50.175
You know, I spent £500 on a
lawyer and she didn't even turn up?

36:51.066 --> 36:53.666
But your little Milly's all right,
though, she looks happy enough.

36:53.902 --> 36:56.143
- Yeah, she's amazing. Full of beans.
- Ah.

36:57.042 --> 36:59.562
I've got to be honest, we're like
best mates now, the two of us.

37:00.145 --> 37:01.768
Well, me, her and Keith.

37:02.492 --> 37:03.496
Who's Keith?

37:08.132 --> 37:10.430
Oh, my God, there he is!

37:10.908 --> 37:12.742
Keith, forward two feet.

37:16.894 --> 37:18.983
He's brilliant! Does he talk?

37:19.193 --> 37:22.228
Oh, only simple
things. Hello, Keith.

37:22.518 --> 37:23.757
Hello, Tony.

37:24.485 --> 37:25.615
Freaks me out a bit.

37:25.640 --> 37:28.037
Ah, they keep telling us
these things are going to

37:28.062 --> 37:31.247
rule the world, all he can do is
fetch a can of pop out the fridge.

37:31.721 --> 37:34.760
But she loves him, though.
Milly loves Keith, yes?

37:35.440 --> 37:37.191
Keith loves Milly.

37:40.057 --> 37:42.918
And Milly's at
your sister's, yeah?

37:48.575 --> 37:52.527
You okay? I mean, is there
anything I should do or not do?

37:52.552 --> 37:53.800
Yeah, just get on with it.

37:57.364 --> 37:59.127
But, have you got a condom?

37:59.741 --> 38:00.956
Yeah, don't worry.

38:01.074 --> 38:02.114
I'm fully equipped.

38:07.335 --> 38:09.007
- Oh, what was that?
- What?

38:13.138 --> 38:14.138
That?

38:15.356 --> 38:16.419
It's just a thing.

38:16.881 --> 38:18.681
Yeah, I know it is but
what do you do with it?

38:21.251 --> 38:22.684
I get lonely, you know.

38:24.716 --> 38:25.879
Oh, my God.

38:40.711 --> 38:42.244
Orifice open.

38:42.269 --> 38:44.936
Honestly, I was only mucking
about! Oh, don't now, Rosie.

38:45.215 --> 38:48.139
- Come back to bed.
- You have sex with your robot!

38:48.454 --> 38:51.784
Oh, my God! No way!

38:51.933 --> 38:54.604
Oh, shut up, it's not funny.

38:54.717 --> 38:57.682
But... it's a robot
called Keith.

38:57.707 --> 38:58.775
Hello, Tony.

38:59.096 --> 39:00.220
Not now, Keith.

39:03.644 --> 39:05.940
- So, did you stay?
- No, I did not.

39:05.965 --> 39:08.572
I said, thank you very much,
Tony Watts, and got out.

39:08.629 --> 39:13.087
- Ah. You could have had Keith instead.
- I bet Keith has got attachments.

39:14.172 --> 39:17.284
- Oh, you'd love that, wouldn't ya?
- Well, I'd give it a go.

39:17.309 --> 39:18.309
What was it?

39:18.570 --> 39:20.998
- Uh, robot sex thing.
- Ah.

39:23.201 --> 39:27.490
Oh, so, listen, I was thinking,
what we get Gran for her birthday?

39:27.530 --> 39:30.715
'Cos I saw it advertised,
the Gypsy Kings.

39:31.616 --> 39:33.512
- Do you think?
- Are they still going?

39:33.687 --> 39:36.575
Oh, they are
immortal. Oh, she's on.

39:36.701 --> 39:40.817
Are we ready? Are
we? Ah, hope it works.

39:40.842 --> 39:43.412
The movement known as the
Four Start Party intends to field

39:43.437 --> 39:45.589
a minimum of 17 MPs at the...

39:45.614 --> 39:50.191
Have you seen the TV? She's
formed her own party, that monster.

39:50.277 --> 39:51.769
We haven't got a TV any more.

39:53.420 --> 39:55.415
My first-ever front page.

39:55.541 --> 39:57.362
What's me mother going to say?

39:58.096 --> 40:00.566
We are calling it
the Four Star Party,

40:01.157 --> 40:07.383
in honour of my little faux pas
on live TV all those years ago.

40:08.760 --> 40:14.236
And the censorship that I have faced
ever since on the fake news media.

40:15.398 --> 40:20.883
But we are four stars, we
are four stars striving to be five.

40:21.245 --> 40:24.915
That's what we
represent, ambition,

40:25.524 --> 40:28.695
the ambition of the
ordinary man and woman.

40:29.322 --> 40:31.703
The people abandoned
by the parties of old.

40:32.165 --> 40:35.151
How can she launch a political
party? She ain't even an MP.

40:35.184 --> 40:36.210
You don't have to be.

40:36.917 --> 40:39.952
We could launch a party right now,
but we don't, 'cos we can't be arsed.

40:39.977 --> 40:42.757
Labour is dead.
The Tories are dead.

40:43.038 --> 40:44.491
The Liberal Democrats are dead.

40:44.516 --> 40:46.116
And then we complain
about people who do.

40:46.810 --> 40:47.881
Well, at least she's trying.

40:47.905 --> 40:51.225
And the Four Start
party is bursting with life.

40:51.794 --> 40:54.396
- I'd vote for her.
- Don't you dare!

40:55.037 --> 40:56.389
Four Stars!

40:56.723 --> 40:59.550
The crisis over Hong Sha
Dao continues to worsen...

40:59.575 --> 41:02.870
Do you understand this
thing with China? Is it real?

41:03.151 --> 41:05.081
Oh, it's just
America going nuts.

41:05.106 --> 41:07.604
You know, their elections
get madder and madder.

41:07.979 --> 41:09.541
So, the Gypsy Kings, yeah?

41:09.869 --> 41:12.190
Tell you what, if we get two
tickets can I have the other one?

41:12.214 --> 41:13.214
No.

41:14.007 --> 41:16.790
Tensions are rising in the
stand-off between the US

41:16.815 --> 41:20.008
and China over the disputed
territory of Hong Sha Dao.

41:20.186 --> 41:22.929
President Trump has announced
a new round of sanctions

41:22.954 --> 41:26.893
and has upped the stakes by tweeting
that America will never back down.

41:27.003 --> 41:29.639
We have breakfast tomorrow,
then we go first thing.

41:29.780 --> 41:30.787
No Sunday lunch.

41:31.077 --> 41:32.499
Got that, all of you?

41:33.929 --> 41:35.912
Oh, here comes the dragon lady.

41:36.210 --> 41:37.881
Prepare for danger. Stand by.

41:37.906 --> 41:39.781
I'm just trying to listen. This
whole thing's gone a bit mad.

41:39.805 --> 41:42.529
Well, you bring us all this
way, now you can deal with her.

41:42.919 --> 41:43.919
Hi!

41:44.665 --> 41:46.185
Happy birthday.

41:46.973 --> 41:49.637
Hello. We did it! We made it!

41:49.867 --> 41:53.442
Well, don't make it sound like
such an effort. Not on my behalf.

41:53.715 --> 41:55.909
Aw, you don't look
a day over 900.

41:57.139 --> 41:59.738
- Hey, hey, hey! How was it?
- Hello. Hi.

42:00.363 --> 42:02.215
- Fine, good. No problem.
- Hello.

42:02.604 --> 42:05.190
- Are you putting on weight?
- Ha. I told him that!

42:05.331 --> 42:07.236
I married the wrong
brother. Come here!

42:07.261 --> 42:09.079
Now, Stephen has been busy.

42:09.236 --> 42:11.235
He's made that cake
with the white frosting.

42:11.260 --> 42:12.829
Oooh!

42:12.854 --> 42:14.534
And he's made that one
with crystallised ginger

42:14.558 --> 42:15.596
'cause everyone liked that.

42:15.620 --> 42:18.001
- Ah, little Susie Homemaker.
- That's me.

42:18.165 --> 42:21.689
And I bought gluten free
rolls, Bethany, just for you.

42:22.582 --> 42:26.079
OK, but... Uh, she's
not gluten free any more.

42:26.187 --> 42:27.540
It's a misdiagnosis.

42:27.772 --> 42:29.836
Turns out it's misdiagnosis
for most of the world.

42:30.037 --> 42:31.703
What we thought
was gluten intolerance,

42:31.728 --> 42:33.258
turns out to be
fructose intolerance.

42:33.397 --> 42:35.936
It's this, um,
sugar chain thing.

42:36.369 --> 42:37.968
Uh, that's what
they're saying, anyway.

42:38.342 --> 42:42.724
Well, I wouldn't know in my
little kitchen in Manchester.

42:43.321 --> 42:46.826
Perhaps if you visited me more
than once a year, I would know better.

42:46.851 --> 42:50.036
- Hey, I was here two months ago.
- I was talking to your wife.

43:13.339 --> 43:14.651
You little idiot.

43:18.535 --> 43:20.314
But it is an emergency.

43:20.822 --> 43:22.736
We've got four days
left of this presidency,

43:22.761 --> 43:25.055
four days in which he
can do anything he likes.

43:25.284 --> 43:26.972
But America won't back down,

43:27.160 --> 43:29.589
and China's made it
clear they won't back down.

43:29.700 --> 43:31.251
So what do you think
is going to happen?

43:31.275 --> 43:33.713
The situation is
running out of control.

43:38.563 --> 43:42.205
Here we are. Bit burnt. That's
all part of the experience.

43:42.809 --> 43:44.209
Now, these ones
over here are lamb.

43:45.010 --> 43:46.136
They eat so much meat.

43:46.161 --> 43:47.574
It's like we married
Henry the Eighth.

43:47.598 --> 43:49.129
I am freezing.

43:49.183 --> 43:51.815
It's all right for Muriel, her
nerve endings died in 1976.

43:53.409 --> 43:55.476
There you go! Birthday feast.

43:55.760 --> 43:58.330
Come on then, Gran.
Let's have the speech.

43:58.355 --> 44:00.019
"I remember when all
this was Woolworths."

44:00.870 --> 44:03.471
Well, I do. I loved that shop.

44:04.103 --> 44:06.916
I used to buy 45
inch singles there.

44:07.575 --> 44:11.056
That was back in the day,
when we still had butterflies.

44:11.085 --> 44:13.243
When did you last
see one of those?

44:13.484 --> 44:17.259
Although, I'll tell you one
thing we didn't have, tsunamis.

44:18.092 --> 44:20.615
What? Don't be daft.
What do you mean?

44:20.792 --> 44:24.615
No, we didn't. We had
earthquakes, but that was it.

44:24.918 --> 44:28.473
The tsunami is an
entirely modern invention.

44:28.834 --> 44:29.905
I love it.

44:30.118 --> 44:33.258
- Here's to you, Gran. Everyone.
- Happy birthday, Muriel.

44:33.283 --> 44:35.555
Hey, did I tell you?
Dad's moved house.

44:36.121 --> 44:38.569
It looks nice, online.
It's off the main road.

44:38.929 --> 44:40.069
Well, good for him.

44:40.846 --> 44:42.773
And that's an end
to it, don't you think?

44:42.842 --> 44:43.983
Oh, be fair, though.

44:44.171 --> 44:47.240
He's been with Jacqueline
for, what? Decades now.

44:47.958 --> 44:50.631
And she's quite nice. Maybe
we should invite them next year.

44:50.931 --> 44:55.177
I said that's an end to it,
and anybody who disagrees

44:55.202 --> 44:57.927
is quite welcome to leave
and go back to London.

44:59.581 --> 45:03.363
Hey, did you hear? Ruby's been
telling us about her porn class.

45:03.388 --> 45:05.059
- What?
- No way. Seriously?

45:05.084 --> 45:06.785
You don't actually
have a porn class.

45:06.810 --> 45:09.512
No, it's called Sexual
Awareness Image And Control.

45:09.537 --> 45:11.980
Well, they get taught
pornography from the age of 11.

45:12.005 --> 45:15.105
It's official. It's
compulsory, they need it!

45:15.418 --> 45:18.339
Compulsory porn, woo! Love it.

45:18.364 --> 45:21.471
You're on the list. Category 15.

45:21.496 --> 45:24.784
Middle aged gay male,
likely to mock boundaries

45:24.809 --> 45:27.236
and force sexual
references into my orbit.

45:27.807 --> 45:30.546
- Aye, Danny!
- Bang on I'd say.

45:30.571 --> 45:32.705
Congratulations, Dan,
you're on the syllabus.

45:32.730 --> 45:35.072
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't
realise you had an "orbit".

45:35.097 --> 45:36.744
Danny!

46:10.440 --> 46:13.788
- Hi.
- Oh, no way. It's Edith.

46:13.813 --> 46:15.527
- Hi, hiya.
- Where are you?

46:15.528 --> 46:17.555
- We're all here. We're in the garden.
- Are you okay, Gran?

46:17.556 --> 46:20.538
- You remembered my birthday.
- Have you heard the news?

46:20.539 --> 46:23.386
We bought Gran Gypsy King
tickets, so you can pay for a quarter.

46:23.411 --> 46:26.113
Yeah, you're missing out.
We're all being categorised.

46:27.119 --> 46:29.893
- Are you all right, darling?
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

46:29.918 --> 46:33.736
I think. I don't know. I don't... I
don't know if it matters any more.

46:33.813 --> 46:36.593
- Where are you?
- Uh, Vietnam.

46:36.618 --> 46:40.030
On the coast, just down
from Ho Chi Minh City.

46:40.400 --> 46:41.490
Oh, all right for some.

46:41.515 --> 46:43.764
We came here to
protest, but too late.

46:43.789 --> 46:47.201
It's only just over
there, Hong Sha Dao.

46:47.494 --> 46:49.333
Is that on the island thing?

46:49.528 --> 46:51.786
For God's sake, Gran,
don't you watch the news?

46:51.811 --> 46:53.239
I send you a link every day.

46:53.463 --> 46:56.481
Hong Sha Dao is
an artificial island.

46:56.506 --> 47:00.465
It's built by the Chinese,
population 26,000,

47:00.490 --> 47:01.552
but it's more than that.

47:01.553 --> 47:03.957
It's a military base
with nuclear weapons.

47:03.982 --> 47:05.418
That's what America says.

47:05.443 --> 47:07.653
It was on the radio this
morning. Why? What's happened?

47:26.358 --> 47:28.446
Is that siren with you or us?

47:28.782 --> 47:31.470
- It's here.
- 'Cos it's here as well.

47:32.340 --> 47:33.395
What does it mean?

47:33.514 --> 47:35.710
They've... They've
launched a missile.

47:36.671 --> 47:39.077
- Who has? China?
- Uh, America.

47:39.102 --> 47:43.841
They fired a nuclear
missile at Hong Sha.

47:43.972 --> 47:45.459
- You're kidding.
- Oh, my God.

47:46.222 --> 47:49.314
He did it, Donald Trump
did it in his final days of office.

47:49.506 --> 47:54.252
But... we haven't got sirens, have
we? Where is that coming from?

47:55.044 --> 47:56.817
We don't have sirens,
we just, we just don't.

47:56.842 --> 47:59.020
- We're not at war, are we?
- Are they firing at us?

47:59.138 --> 48:00.138
Of course they aren't.

48:00.163 --> 48:01.344
Yeah, but China and
America, if they go to war,

48:01.368 --> 48:02.516
we're directly in the
middle aren't we?

48:02.540 --> 48:04.078
We're not in the middle,
we're not even on the edge,

48:04.102 --> 48:05.757
they'd fire over the
Pacific, not over us.

48:05.782 --> 48:07.837
That is a four-minute warning.
Don't tell me nothing's happening,

48:07.861 --> 48:10.392
- I can hear a four-minute warning!
- TV. There's a thing on TV!

48:10.417 --> 48:13.134
This is a broadcast on behalf
of His Majesty's Government.

48:14.522 --> 48:16.805
It has been announced
by the Prime Minister that

48:16.830 --> 48:18.634
the United Kingdom
of Great Britain

48:18.659 --> 48:20.853
and Northern Ireland
has been placed

48:20.878 --> 48:25.657
on an official war footing,
as of 17.15 this afternoon.

48:25.851 --> 48:28.782
- Excuse me!
- Come on, Gran. Come on!

48:33.184 --> 48:35.223
Miles from mainland China.

48:36.152 --> 48:40.861
The United States of America
has launched a nuclear missile

48:40.886 --> 48:42.840
at the disputed
Chinese territory...

48:42.865 --> 48:44.813
- Who is he?
- All channels are the same.

48:45.021 --> 48:48.078
He's not an official newsreader,
is he? I've never seen him before.

48:48.104 --> 48:49.344
What, do you think it's a hoax?

48:49.580 --> 48:51.166
Well, he's right, it's
on every channel.

48:51.190 --> 48:54.494
Are we at war? Does this
mean we're at war? Great Britain?

48:54.519 --> 48:55.519
I don't know.

48:55.544 --> 48:58.800
Is a UGM-133A Trident II D-5...

48:58.825 --> 49:01.184
- Did he say Trident?
- That us! That's us, isn't it?

49:01.209 --> 49:03.491
Oh, my God, that's us! Edith, is
that us? Does Trident mean us?

49:03.515 --> 49:05.108
Are we the only ones
with Trident missiles?

49:05.132 --> 49:06.443
- I don't know.
- Or have they used us?

49:06.467 --> 49:07.502
- I don't know.
- Is that what they've done?

49:07.503 --> 49:09.272
- Have America used us?
- Stephen, I don't know.

49:09.296 --> 49:11.279
They're going to shoot it down,
the Chinese, it's not going to land.

49:11.303 --> 49:13.490
They shoot these missiles
down all the time, it's what they do.

49:13.514 --> 49:15.177
The United Kingdom
of Great Britain

49:15.202 --> 49:17.489
and Northern Ireland
has been placed

49:17.514 --> 49:22.131
on an official war footing,
as of 17:15 this afternoon.

49:23.457 --> 49:27.677
The United States of America
has launched a nuclear missile

49:27.928 --> 49:30.053
at the disputed
Chinese territory

49:30.078 --> 49:33.264
of Hong Sha Dao in
the South China Sea...

49:33.289 --> 49:38.647
and artificial island, 760
miles from Mainland China

49:38.967 --> 49:40.971
What does that mean? Is it over?

49:43.707 --> 49:44.765
Is that it?

49:44.993 --> 49:47.227
It was, it was just a
warning, you know, like a test.

49:47.252 --> 49:48.252
They were testing it.

49:48.277 --> 49:49.938
No, it doesn't
stop 'cos it's over.

49:51.141 --> 49:54.655
It's like in the war films, the siren
doesn't keep going throughout

49:54.680 --> 49:57.648
the air raid, it just warns you
and then it stops and then...

49:59.615 --> 50:00.776
The bombs hit.

50:02.417 --> 50:03.421
Yeah.

50:08.751 --> 50:11.863
- Where are you going, Danny?
- Danny, where are you going?

50:12.277 --> 50:14.522
Thank God, 'cos if this
is the end of the world,

50:14.547 --> 50:16.467
I don't want to see it
with that lot, no offence.

50:24.120 --> 50:25.173
Let me in, then.

50:26.108 --> 50:27.989
What are you doing? Daniel?

50:30.755 --> 50:33.778
Don't you dare! Danny! Danny!

50:37.361 --> 50:40.222
I knew it. Oh,
my God, I knew it!

50:42.270 --> 50:44.690
How long does it take
for the missiles to arrive?

50:44.715 --> 50:47.971
I've said, we don't know
where it's launched from,

50:47.996 --> 50:50.713
so we don't know
how long it takes.

50:50.738 --> 50:52.462
We should be safe in this house.

50:52.681 --> 50:54.876
We've got our very
own little Chinaman.

50:55.514 --> 50:58.188
- They'll leave us alone.
- For God's sake, Gran.

50:58.764 --> 51:01.442
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

51:02.498 --> 51:05.513
- No, what does that mean?
- Nothing.

51:05.692 --> 51:08.878
What the fuck is that supposed
to mean, you stupid old woman?

51:17.019 --> 51:19.219
Do you know what, I think a
false alarm will do us good?

51:19.413 --> 51:22.783
'Cos we let America get away
with all that sabre-rattling and

51:23.143 --> 51:25.212
now China is just as
much to blame and...

51:28.543 --> 51:31.106
Edith. Edith, can you hear me?

51:39.200 --> 51:40.370
Oh, shit.

51:46.365 --> 51:51.830
We can confirm a nuclear
device has detonated on the island

51:51.855 --> 51:56.618
of Hong Sha Dao, at
17.53 Greenwich meantime,

51:56.643 --> 52:01.212
02.53 within the region
of the South China Sea.

52:01.237 --> 52:03.962
- But where's Edith?
- Vietnam.

52:04.439 --> 52:05.690
How close is that?

52:06.509 --> 52:08.232
- Stephen? Where's
Vietnam - I don't know.

52:08.257 --> 52:09.750
- Compared to China? How close, is she?
- Just... Just...

52:09.774 --> 52:10.905
What if they fire back?

52:10.930 --> 52:12.940
- All right. Rosie, just listen...
- What if they fire back?

52:12.964 --> 52:14.084
Everybody calm down, please.

52:51.075 --> 52:54.223
- Stephen, what do we do?
- Celeste, how the hell do I know?!

52:55.222 --> 52:57.249
Bomb the Chinese!
Blow them to bits!

52:57.461 --> 52:58.758
I'm not in charge!

52:59.981 --> 53:01.349
You can be whatever
you want to be.

53:01.373 --> 53:03.373
Do you hear me? You can
be whatever you want to be.

54:10.498 --> 54:13.740
Just listen to the man. Rosie,
will you control him please.

54:13.765 --> 54:14.912
Don't have a go at me.

54:14.937 --> 54:16.779
Stephen, can you
just stop shout...

54:51.568 --> 54:52.643
What happens now?

54:53.293 --> 54:55.301
What happens now?
What happens now?!

55:03.208 --> 55:04.809
Did you know you
can live forever?

55:24.053 --> 55:26.709
Are you with me?
