02:34.783 --> 02:37.453
Let's see what you got.

02:37.493 --> 02:40.533
I need more runners. I can't
write the business fast enough.

02:40.573 --> 02:42.953
You gotta see Granger.

02:49.123 --> 02:53.258
8720. Yeah. Yeah.
Hold it a minute.

02:53.293 --> 02:57.303
Beat it, Mottola! Mr. Granger?
Chicago's on the line.

02:59.053 --> 03:01.013
Yeah.

03:01.053 --> 03:04.183
This is Combs. Why haven't we
heard from you? Everybody else is in.

03:04.223 --> 03:06.853
We had problems
with the law this morning.

03:06.893 --> 03:09.443
The mayor promised
to get tough on the rackets...

03:09.483 --> 03:12.233
so he shut everybody down for a
couple of hours to make it look good.

03:12.273 --> 03:14.153
Nothing serious. It just
put us a little behind.

03:14.188 --> 03:16.788
- Been making your payoffs?
- Hell, yes!

03:16.823 --> 03:18.783
He does this every year. There's
nothing to worry about.

03:18.823 --> 03:23.203
Finish your count and get it up here.
I don't want to be here all night.

03:23.243 --> 03:25.373
The man's going to be real happy.

03:25.413 --> 03:26.993
We cleared over ten grand this week.

03:27.028 --> 03:28.543
We cleared 22 here.

03:28.583 --> 03:31.753
What the hell! You got the
whole Chicago South Side.

03:31.793 --> 03:35.153
How do you expect my eight
lousy spots to compete with that?

03:35.188 --> 03:38.513
They did 14 grand in Evanston,
16.5 in Gary, and 20 in Cicero.

03:38.548 --> 03:41.148
Looks like you're bringing
up the rear.

03:41.183 --> 03:44.143
I just got the count. I'll
put the take on the 4:15.

03:44.183 --> 03:46.313
We'll be waiting.

03:48.933 --> 03:50.683
Mottola!

03:52.523 --> 03:56.193
Take this up to Chicago on the 4:15.

03:56.233 --> 03:59.533
They'll be waiting for
it at the clearinghouse.

03:59.573 --> 04:04.373
And don't stop for any
entertainment. Get a cab over on 7th.

04:04.413 --> 04:06.993
Cut it out!

04:07.033 --> 04:08.993
8720.

04:21.723 --> 04:25.093
Hey, you there! Stop! Hey,
you! Stop that man!

04:25.143 --> 04:29.103
Stop him! He's got my
wallet! Stop him! Stop that man!

04:29.143 --> 04:31.433
He's got all of my money!

04:31.483 --> 04:33.563
Stop him! Stop him!

04:34.733 --> 04:37.443
Goddamn nigger-lover!

04:40.113 --> 04:42.823
I'm gonna get you someday
for this! Sucker egg!

04:42.863 --> 04:47.033
Don't let him get away! He's got
my wallet! He's got all my money!

04:47.073 --> 04:50.043
- My wallet! He's got my wallet!
- We got it!

04:50.083 --> 04:53.213
What happened? Did he
get you with the knife?

04:53.253 --> 04:56.213
- You need a doctor. I'll call a cop.
- No, no! No cops!

04:58.423 --> 05:00.963
You wanted by the law or something?

05:01.013 --> 05:04.183
No, it's okay.

05:04.223 --> 05:07.603
Are you nuts, carrying a wad like
that in a neighborhood like this?

05:07.638 --> 05:11.813
Thanks. I'm obliged to
you. I gotta get going.

05:11.853 --> 05:14.313
You ain't going nowhere on this leg.

05:14.353 --> 05:18.313
I gotta. Gotta run some
slots in West Bend for a mob here.

05:18.363 --> 05:20.448
I got a little
behind in the payoffs.

05:20.483 --> 05:22.533
They think I've been
holding out on 'em.

05:22.573 --> 05:25.653
They gave me 'til 4:00 to
come up with the cash.

05:25.703 --> 05:27.573
If they don't get it, I'm dead.

05:27.623 --> 05:29.743
It don't look good,
Gramps. It's almost 4:00 now.

05:29.783 --> 05:33.663
I'll give you and your friend a
hundred bucks to deliver it for me.

05:35.373 --> 05:38.923
I don't know. That mug that hit
you is mad enough at me already.

05:38.963 --> 05:41.633
What if he's around the
corner, waiting with some friends?

05:41.668 --> 05:44.735
He won't know you're carrying
it. You've gotta help me.

05:44.770 --> 05:47.803
I'm sorry, pal. I'm gonna maybe
help you get to a doctor...

05:47.838 --> 05:50.053
but I ain't about to
walk into no knife for you.

05:50.103 --> 05:52.603
How about you? All you gotta
do is put it in the door slot.

05:52.643 --> 05:54.603
I'll give you the whole 100.

05:54.643 --> 05:56.943
What makes you think you can
trust him? He didn't do shit.

05:56.983 --> 05:58.353
Butt out!

05:58.403 --> 06:00.863
I gave him back the
wallet. How far is this place?

06:00.903 --> 06:05.323
1811 Mason. Put it in box
3- C. You won't have no trouble.

06:06.743 --> 06:09.128
There's $5,000 there...

06:09.163 --> 06:11.628
and here's a hundred bucks for you.

06:11.663 --> 06:16.713
Okay, I'll make your drop for you.
And don't worry, you can trust me.

06:16.753 --> 06:19.638
Hey. Hey!

06:19.673 --> 06:22.423
If those goons search you, you ain't
gonna get far carrying it there.

06:22.463 --> 06:25.423
- What'll we do?
- You got a bag or something?

06:25.463 --> 06:28.433
- How about a handkerchief?
- Here's a handkerchief!

06:28.473 --> 06:31.103
Give it to me. Give me the money.

06:31.143 --> 06:34.433
Just hurry, will you?

06:34.473 --> 06:38.103
You got any more? Better give it
all to me if you want to keep it.

06:38.143 --> 06:39.988
They think I've been holding out.

06:40.023 --> 06:42.113
My wife got sick, and
I had to pay the bill.

06:43.403 --> 06:47.243
Stuff it down your pants
here, like that. Got it?

06:47.283 --> 06:48.073
Hurry, will ya?

06:48.113 --> 06:50.453
Ain't a tough guy in the
world that's gonna frisk you there.

06:50.493 --> 06:52.873
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

07:05.503 --> 07:07.633
Where to?

07:07.673 --> 07:10.223
- Which way is Mason?
- Twenty blocks south.

07:10.263 --> 07:13.263
- Go north, Joliet Station, fast!
- Right.

07:17.523 --> 07:19.483
What's so funny?

07:19.523 --> 07:22.103
I just made the
world's easiest five grand!

07:33.573 --> 07:36.493
- Come on, Luther! Come on!
- Hold on, man! Okay!

07:36.543 --> 07:39.503
Hustle!

07:41.543 --> 07:44.093
In here!

07:45.593 --> 07:48.888
Man, was that beautiful!

07:48.923 --> 07:51.763
I thought for sure he was on to us.

07:51.803 --> 07:54.763
No, you had him all
the way. All the way!

07:59.023 --> 08:02.568
Wai...
Luther.

08:02.603 --> 08:04.908
Good God! We're millionaires.

08:04.943 --> 08:07.443
- Did you know he was that loaded?
- Hell, no!

08:07.478 --> 08:08.498
I just cut into him.

08:08.533 --> 08:11.453
I would've settled for
pawning one of them shoes.

08:11.488 --> 08:14.073
Oh, God!

08:14.123 --> 08:17.373
Do
you...

08:18.793 --> 08:20.963
Come on. Let's get out of
here. We'll split it up tonight.

08:57.913 --> 09:00.373
Heya, Marge!

09:10.593 --> 09:13.883
- Hi, kid.
- Hi, Hooker. She's on stage.

09:18.643 --> 09:21.103
Hi, Hooker. Gettin'
married or something?

09:21.143 --> 09:24.773
Get used to it, Leonard. I'm going
to look this good from now on.

09:24.813 --> 09:27.233
- Whaddaya say, Ed?
- Hi, Hooker.

09:42.873 --> 09:45.213
I wanna
talk...

09:51.053 --> 09:54.673
Hey, Hooker, you
gettin' married or somethin'?

10:00.103 --> 10:02.933
For Christ's sake,
Ed, did you hear that?

10:02.973 --> 10:05.523
Harry drops four beats in the
middle of my goddamn routine!

10:05.563 --> 10:07.443
- How long do I gotta
put up with that?

10:07.478 --> 10:08.868
Crystal! Leonard, you're on.

10:08.903 --> 10:11.903
You wanna get outta here
tonight? I come into some dough.

10:11.938 --> 10:15.443
I can't. I got a
10:00. I need the five bucks.

10:15.493 --> 10:17.913
I'll spend 50 on you.

10:17.953 --> 10:20.703
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

10:20.743 --> 10:22.953
Okay.

10:22.993 --> 10:25.253
.. opens up his pants, the
duck sticks his head out.

10:25.293 --> 10:28.258
One lady says to the
other, "See what I see?"

10:28.293 --> 10:31.293
She says, "So what? You've
seen one, you've seen 'em all."

10:31.328 --> 10:34.513
She says, "Yes, but this
one's eating my popcorn."

10:37.763 --> 10:41.353
You see that guy
Harry, he can't keep time.

10:41.393 --> 10:44.523
Supposing there's some
Hollywood movie agent out there.

10:44.563 --> 10:47.183
All those years of
training right down the drain.

10:47.233 --> 10:49.563
Ain't seen you in
months. Thought you took a fall.

10:49.603 --> 10:51.863
Just a little hard
times. Everything's jake now.

10:51.903 --> 10:53.903
How about a ten spot on the line?

10:53.943 --> 10:56.943
There's a lot of action
there on 28th Street. Pay you 35...

10:57.953 --> 10:59.823
Three grand on the red.

10:59.863 --> 11:02.073
- $3,000?
- Are you nuts?

11:02.123 --> 11:03.248
No, I feel lucky.

11:03.283 --> 11:06.293
Hooker, I can't accept
that. It's too big a bet.

11:06.328 --> 11:08.913
- There's a house limit.
- Take it.

11:08.963 --> 11:11.043
- But Hooker
here... - Take it!

11:18.803 --> 11:21.933
Twenty-two, black.

11:23.103 --> 11:25.683
Tough luck, kid.

11:25.723 --> 11:27.683
Lucky for me it came up black.

11:27.733 --> 11:30.443
A fella could get in trouble
here, losin' a bet like that.

11:30.483 --> 11:33.773
Listen, Jimmy, can't
we do it again, huh?

11:38.653 --> 11:41.743
Seven!

11:43.283 --> 11:46.583
Don't worry about it. There's
always more where that came from.

11:46.623 --> 11:49.293
Oh, don't worry about it, he
says. Three thousand dollars!

11:49.333 --> 11:50.968
Thanks, Hooker.

11:51.003 --> 11:54.173
Comes in here with $50 he's
going to spend on me!

11:57.173 --> 11:59.633
- Thanks for the evening, Hooker.
- It's not over yet.

11:59.673 --> 12:02.223
Next time you wanna spend
$50 on me, mail it.

12:03.183 --> 12:05.813
Listen,
will ya...

12:58.943 --> 13:03.073
They found Mottola, drunk in a dive
in Joliet. He never got on the train.

13:03.108 --> 13:06.203
I don't wanna hear about his day,
Greer. What happened to the money?

13:06.243 --> 13:09.913
He lost it to a couple of con
artists on his way out of the spot.

13:09.948 --> 13:12.913
- How much?
- Eleven thousand.

13:15.503 --> 13:19.068
Okay, I better get on
the phone to New York...

13:19.103 --> 13:22.633
see what the big
mick wants to do about it.

13:22.673 --> 13:25.133
I have a pretty good idea, though.

14:09.973 --> 14:13.103
- Doyle, can I talk to you?
- I'm busy, Floyd.

14:13.143 --> 14:16.693
It's important. We had a
little trouble in Chicago today.

14:16.733 --> 14:20.278
One of our runners got
hit for 11 grand.

14:20.313 --> 14:23.483
What makes you think he
just didn't pocket it?

14:23.533 --> 14:27.953
We checked his story with a tipster.
He was cleaned by two grifters.

14:27.993 --> 14:29.823
They working for anybody?

14:29.873 --> 14:33.913
I don't know. Could be. We're
running that down now.

14:33.953 --> 14:37.673
Have some local people take
care of them. Nothing fancy.

14:37.713 --> 14:40.673
We've got to
discourage this kind of thing.

14:42.383 --> 14:44.843
You follow?

15:02.863 --> 15:04.903
Johnny Hooker!

15:05.483 --> 15:07.573
- If you ain't a
sharper in them linens!

15:07.608 --> 15:08.493
Evenin', Louise.

15:08.533 --> 15:09.913
Hey, Ma!

15:09.953 --> 15:12.873
If I didn't know you better,
I'd swear you had some class.

15:12.913 --> 15:16.913
Johnny, Luther said you
was something to see today!

15:16.948 --> 15:19.003
I don't know, Alva.

15:19.043 --> 15:20.918
I gotta get faster
tyin' that bundle.

15:20.953 --> 15:22.793
I still give 'em too
much time to think.

15:22.843 --> 15:27.303
Bushwah! I used to make that switch
with slower hands than you got.

15:27.343 --> 15:30.223
'Course, the Up and Down
Broadway was my best game.

15:30.263 --> 15:34.358
Me and Luther didn't make much
on it, but it wasn't so touchy.

15:34.393 --> 15:38.353
Them marks can beat you up bad when
they catch you makin' that switch.

15:38.393 --> 15:40.393
Come on, Leroy. We'll
be late for church.

15:40.443 --> 15:43.193
Ma, they were closin'
in on Machine Gun Kelly!

15:43.233 --> 15:45.023
Who you rootin' for anyhow?

15:45.073 --> 15:46.903
- Hey, Hooker!
- Can't help you, Leroy.

15:46.943 --> 15:48.823
- You can't beat the house.
- Nuts!

15:48.863 --> 15:50.953
Since when do you
go to church at night?

15:50.993 --> 15:53.123
Since they started late bingo.

15:53.163 --> 15:54.458
I'm gonna ask the Lord for some of

15:54.493 --> 15:56.123
that cash while He's
still payin' off.

15:56.163 --> 15:59.043
Luther, look in on the baby
from time to time, will you?

15:59.078 --> 16:01.923
- You too, Louise? - Child, yeah,
got to go pray. See ya.

16:01.958 --> 16:04.218
Hey, Erie.

16:04.253 --> 16:07.673
- Gimme! Gimme, gimme!
- There's your cut.

16:07.713 --> 16:10.973
Guy turned out to be an oil well.

16:11.013 --> 16:11.938
Which way'd he go?

16:11.973 --> 16:13.898
- Due north. He was
gonna take it all.

16:13.933 --> 16:17.603
Ah, the bastard. He can
blow his nose all the way.

16:21.313 --> 16:25.063
There you go, Luther. Six G's.

16:26.773 --> 16:30.153
- You're late. Where you been?
- I had a couple of appointments.

16:31.453 --> 16:34.703
How much did you lose?

16:37.793 --> 16:40.753
All of it.

16:40.793 --> 16:43.423
In one goddamn night?

16:43.463 --> 16:45.713
What are you spraying
money around like that for?

16:45.753 --> 16:47.098
You could've been nailed!

16:47.133 --> 16:49.263
- I checked. There
were no dicks there.

16:49.303 --> 16:51.618
But you're a con man, and
you blew it like a pimp!

16:51.653 --> 16:53.933
- Didn't teach you to be no pimp.
- What's eatin' you?

16:53.973 --> 16:58.223
- I've blown money before.
- No class grifter would've done it.

16:58.263 --> 17:03.063
- You think my play is bad?
- I think you're the best.

17:06.443 --> 17:09.233
I wouldn't be getting
out, otherwise.

17:10.573 --> 17:12.613
What the hell are you talkin' about?

17:12.653 --> 17:14.953
I'm getting too old for this racket.

17:14.992 --> 17:17.203
You hang on too long and you
start embarrassing yourself.

17:17.242 --> 17:19.792
We just took off on the
biggest score we've ever had.

17:19.833 --> 17:22.623
It's nothing compared to what
you could be making on the big con.

17:22.663 --> 17:24.873
But you played the big con.

17:24.923 --> 17:28.963
You told me yourself it was some dumb
game for mama's boys and flakes.

17:31.263 --> 17:34.053
Hell, I never played no big con.

17:34.093 --> 17:37.143
I hung around and
picked up a few things.

17:37.183 --> 17:41.563
Ain't no rich boys gonna trust a
hungry nigger enough to be conned.

17:41.603 --> 17:43.893
But I'll tell you...

17:43.933 --> 17:47.233
I've been looking for this
one all my life, Johnny.

17:47.273 --> 17:50.863
Now I have a chance to
step out when I'm ahead.

17:50.903 --> 17:53.783
Come on! What would
you do with yourself?

17:53.823 --> 17:57.203
I have a brother in
K. C., runs a freight outlet.

17:57.238 --> 17:59.998
I can go halfsies with him.

18:00.033 --> 18:03.703
It ain't too
exciting, but it's mostly legal.

18:06.423 --> 18:09.963
I got an old friend in
Chicago named Henry Gondorff.

18:10.003 --> 18:14.303
I want you to look him up. There
ain't a better inside man alive.

18:14.343 --> 18:18.183
- He'll teach you all you gotta know.
- To hell with that.

18:18.223 --> 18:20.683
I want to work with you, Luther.

18:20.723 --> 18:23.603
I'm out, Johnny.

18:29.313 --> 18:32.783
Yeah, sure. If that's
the way you want it.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.613
That's the way I want it.

18:38.453 --> 18:42.583
How do you like that
Coleman? After five years.

18:42.623 --> 18:47.088
- He knew he was holding you back.
- Yeah, but we were partners.

18:47.123 --> 18:50.133
If it weren't for Luther, I'd still
be hustling pinball at Gianelli's.

18:50.168 --> 18:52.598
I don't need more than what I got.

18:52.633 --> 18:55.093
You ain't gonna have anything if you
don't lay off the games of chance.

18:55.133 --> 18:56.268
There's a depression on.

18:56.303 --> 18:58.098
- Yeah, there's
always a depression on.

18:58.133 --> 19:00.683
If you saved a little, you
wouldn't have to grift so much.

19:00.723 --> 19:03.223
- I like griftin'.
- You could buy yourself some things.

19:03.263 --> 19:05.183
- What?
- New clothes, a car.

19:05.223 --> 19:07.103
I got clothes, and I
don't know how to drive.

19:07.143 --> 19:09.193
What else do you got to sell?

19:10.603 --> 19:14.443
Hey, Hooker! Come
on, you son of a...

19:17.453 --> 19:19.163
Hi there, Snyder.

19:19.203 --> 19:22.993
What's the matter? Things a little
slow down at the bunco department?

19:23.033 --> 19:24.583
Somebody lose the dominoes?

19:24.623 --> 19:27.663
You scored blood money
today, and you need a friend.

19:27.713 --> 19:30.213
Go find yourself a
shoplifter to roll.

19:33.793 --> 19:38.093
You got the wrong guy, pal. I've
been home with the flu all day.

19:38.133 --> 19:40.973
- Stake out my toilet if you want.
- Keep talkin'!

19:54.023 --> 19:57.958
I'll tell you what
you did, smart boy.

19:57.993 --> 20:01.993
You tied into a loaded mark
on 47th across from Maxie's.

20:02.028 --> 20:04.490
You and Coleman
played the switch for

20:04.525 --> 20:06.953
him and blew him
off to a cab on 49th.

20:06.993 --> 20:09.503
If he hadn't been a
numbers runner for Doyle Lonnegan...

20:09.543 --> 20:11.873
it would've been perfect.

20:11.923 --> 20:14.383
You're crazy.

20:15.803 --> 20:18.763
I ain't stupid enough to
play for no racket's money.

20:18.803 --> 20:23.183
Not intentionally, maybe. That
don't cut no ice with Lonnegan.

20:23.223 --> 20:25.933
- He'll swat you like
a fly. - Yeah, well...

20:27.223 --> 20:29.698
I'll square it with the fixer.

20:29.733 --> 20:33.818
Nobody can buy you a
prayer if I put the finger on you.

20:33.853 --> 20:37.903
Now, I figure your end of the
score was at least three G's.

20:37.943 --> 20:41.403
- I want two, no matter what it was.
- My take was only one.

20:41.453 --> 20:45.743
Then you're gonna have to come
up with another grand somewhere.

20:55.633 --> 20:58.093
All right.

21:09.353 --> 21:12.853
You're a smart egg, Hooker.

21:12.893 --> 21:15.863
No sense getting
dead over two grand.

21:24.073 --> 21:27.073
Relax, Erie. I'll bill ya.

21:36.463 --> 21:39.503
- I thought you blew all your money.
- I did.

21:39.553 --> 21:42.053
The stuff I gave him is counterfeit.

21:42.093 --> 21:45.053
They'll spot it the first
place he tries to spend it.

21:45.093 --> 21:47.683
Are you crazy, giving
him counterfeit money?

21:48.473 --> 21:53.313
Hey! Wait up! Where you goin'?

22:12.453 --> 22:15.623
What the hell are you gonna do if
Snyder puts the finger on you?

22:15.658 --> 22:18.758
- You're committin' suicide, kid.
- What difference does it make?

22:18.793 --> 22:23.133
If Snyder knows, so does everybody
else. He never gets anything first.

22:23.168 --> 22:26.473
Hey, listen to me. Don't go
back to your place tonight.

22:26.508 --> 22:30.053
Don't go anyplace you
usually go. You hear me?

22:30.103 --> 22:32.778
Damn! There's no answer at Luther's.

22:32.813 --> 22:36.353
Look, you better get
out of town or something.

22:36.393 --> 22:40.023
Hey, lady, lady, let go!

22:40.063 --> 22:41.613
Ma'am! Ma'am! Hey!

22:41.653 --> 22:43.823
I want my nickel
back for that telephone!

22:49.913 --> 22:53.453
No, sir. Nobody here did.

22:53.493 --> 22:55.503
1521 North Bryant.

23:13.063 --> 23:16.143
- Is he dead? - I don't know.
There was a big fight.

23:16.183 --> 23:19.273
I don't know. Somebody
must've pushed him.

23:22.693 --> 23:26.323
- Jesus!
- Luther!

23:26.363 --> 23:28.653
- Luther!
- Jesus!

23:28.703 --> 23:31.623
God! No! No! No!

23:31.663 --> 23:34.543
Luther! Luther!

23:34.583 --> 23:38.663
What happened? God, who would
do such a thing to you, Luther?

23:42.383 --> 23:45.053
Come on. Come on! Let's
get out of here.

23:47.173 --> 23:50.843
Come on! If Snyder catches
you here, you're dead!

23:53.473 --> 23:56.223
- Get outta here!
- Outta the way.

23:56.258 --> 23:58.393
Help me, help me, help me!

24:45.983 --> 24:47.613
Excuse me.

24:47.653 --> 24:51.073
I'm looking for a guy named
Henry Gondorff. You know him?

24:51.113 --> 24:52.283
No.

24:57.373 --> 24:59.453
You sure?

24:59.503 --> 25:02.423
- Beat it.
- Luther Coleman sent me.

25:06.043 --> 25:08.753
- Are you Hooker?
- Yeah.

25:10.343 --> 25:12.843
Why didn't you say so?

25:14.183 --> 25:17.643
We heard about Luther
last night. Come on.

25:25.153 --> 25:27.653
I thought maybe you
were a cop or something.

25:27.693 --> 25:30.483
It's the room in the back.

25:30.533 --> 25:34.163
He wasn't expecting
you so soon, though.

25:34.198 --> 25:36.703
Thanks.

26:42.013 --> 26:45.023
The great Henry Gondorff.

26:46.143 --> 26:49.273
Turn it off!

26:51.363 --> 26:53.698
You sober?

26:53.733 --> 26:56.403
Turn it off, will ya?

27:12.383 --> 27:15.343
Glad to meet you, kid. You're
a real horse's ass.

27:15.383 --> 27:18.763
Luther said I could
learn something from you.

27:20.093 --> 27:23.763
I already know how to drink.

27:23.798 --> 27:26.143
Sorry about Luther.

27:26.183 --> 27:29.813
He was the best street
worker I ever saw.

27:31.773 --> 27:35.653
He had you down as a
big-timer. What happened?

27:39.113 --> 27:42.583
I conned a senator from
Florida on a stock deal.

27:42.623 --> 27:46.253
A real lop-ear; thought he was
gonna take over General Electric.

27:46.293 --> 27:49.463
Some chanteusie woke him,
though, and he put the feds on me.

27:49.503 --> 27:52.543
You mean you blew it.

27:52.593 --> 27:55.633
Luther didn't tell
me you had a big mouth.

27:55.673 --> 27:59.183
He didn't tell me you
was a screw up either.

28:07.103 --> 28:10.393
You played any big cons since then?

28:10.443 --> 28:15.483
I lammed around a bunch of bohunk
towns, one kick ahead of the G-men.

28:15.523 --> 28:19.203
Would be still, if Billie
hadn't set me up here.

28:22.243 --> 28:25.533
Don't kid yourself,
friend. I still know how.

28:31.043 --> 28:35.043
You gonna stay for breakfast, or
do you already know how to eat?

28:36.923 --> 28:39.883
I picked something up along the way.

28:43.553 --> 28:46.103
Is Lonnegan after you too?

28:46.143 --> 28:48.683
I don't know. I ain't seen anybody.

28:48.723 --> 28:51.693
You never do, kid.

29:04.663 --> 29:07.243
Doyle?

29:07.283 --> 29:09.373
Yeah.

29:11.293 --> 29:13.463
We just talked to Chicago.

29:13.503 --> 29:15.793
They got one of the
grifters last night... a nigger.

29:17.343 --> 29:22.093
- How about the other one?
- They're still looking for him.

29:22.133 --> 29:25.973
- Who did Combs put on it?
- He gave it to Riley and Cole.

29:26.013 --> 29:29.183
They staked out the other guy's place
last night, but he never showed.

29:29.223 --> 29:31.773
They figure maybe he skipped town.

29:31.813 --> 29:34.403
You wanna keep after him?

29:34.443 --> 29:37.403
You see that fella
in the red sweater?

29:37.443 --> 29:39.573
His name's Danny McCoy.

29:39.613 --> 29:41.403
Works a few of the
protection rackets...

29:41.443 --> 29:43.453
when he's waiting for
something better.

29:43.493 --> 29:47.453
Danny and I have known each
other since we were six.

29:49.543 --> 29:53.043
Take a good look at
that face, Floyd.

29:53.083 --> 29:57.173
Because if he ever finds out I
can be beat by one lousy grifter...

29:57.213 --> 30:00.173
I'll have to kill
him and every other hood...

30:00.213 --> 30:04.303
who wants to muscle in
on my Chicago operation.

30:04.343 --> 30:06.973
- You follow?
- Yes, sir.

30:08.513 --> 30:10.773
Good lad.

30:13.773 --> 30:16.353
You feeling all
right this morning, Henry?

30:16.403 --> 30:18.113
Yeah, fine.

30:18.153 --> 30:20.613
You mind opening up the
round a little early today?

30:20.648 --> 30:22.993
We got some business coming
in before hours.

30:23.033 --> 30:26.453
- Sure.
- Check the main gearing, will ya?

30:26.493 --> 30:30.203
Man O' War started rattling yesterday
and threw a kid on its head.

30:32.663 --> 30:36.623
Great little countess, that Billie.
She runs a spiffy house up there too.

30:36.673 --> 30:38.923
You plan to spend the
rest of your life here?

30:38.963 --> 30:41.463
I could do a lot worse.

30:46.683 --> 30:49.303
Listen, am I gonna learn to
play the big con or not?

30:49.338 --> 30:50.893
What's your hurry?

30:50.933 --> 30:54.523
- I wanna play for Lonnegan.
- You know anything about the guy?

30:54.563 --> 30:57.523
Yeah, he croaked Luther. Anything
else I gotta know?

31:06.153 --> 31:09.453
All right. He runs a numbers
racket on the South Side.

31:09.493 --> 31:12.333
He owns a packing
house, a few banks...

31:12.373 --> 31:15.253
Yeah, and half the
politicians in New York and Chicago.

31:15.293 --> 31:18.253
Not a fix in this world is gonna
cool him out if he blows on you.

31:18.293 --> 31:20.753
- I'll get him anyway.
- Why?

31:20.793 --> 31:25.263
'Cause I don't know
enough about killing to kill him.

31:41.443 --> 31:43.823
You can't do it alone, you know.

31:43.863 --> 31:46.493
It takes a mob of guys and
money to make 'em look good.

31:46.533 --> 31:48.993
- I know plenty of guys.
- It's not like playing winos.

31:49.033 --> 31:50.873
- You can't outrun Lonnegan.
- I never played for no winos.

31:50.913 --> 31:52.663
You gotta keep his con even
after you take his money.

31:52.703 --> 31:54.793
- He can't know you took him.
- You're scared of him.

31:54.833 --> 31:58.253
Right down to my socks, buster.

31:58.293 --> 32:01.253
You're talking about a
guy who'd kill a grifter...

32:01.293 --> 32:04.713
over a chunk of money wouldn't
support him for two days.

32:06.053 --> 32:08.513
You're gonna go for him.

32:10.803 --> 32:12.763
Just don't want a hothead
looking to get even,

32:12.798 --> 32:14.103
coming back halfway through...

32:14.143 --> 32:17.983
saying, "It ain't enough," 'cause
it's all we're gonna get.

32:21.903 --> 32:24.198
Can you get a mob together?

32:24.233 --> 32:27.653
After what happened to Luther,
I can't get more than 300 guys.

32:32.283 --> 32:36.333
Luther said you learn
fast. I hope he's right.

35:07.943 --> 35:10.403
Lonnegan gets most of his
income from the numbers...

35:10.443 --> 35:12.113
even though he's been
putting more money

35:12.148 --> 35:13.573
into his savings and loan business.

35:13.613 --> 35:15.783
- Think he's moving out
of the racket? - No.

35:15.823 --> 35:18.413
He owns most of the
stock, and it's traded.

35:18.453 --> 35:21.083
My guess is he's just trying to
build himself a respectable image.

35:21.123 --> 35:23.163
He came out of Five Points...

35:23.203 --> 35:25.373
but he's been telling everybody
he was born in Forest Hills.

35:25.408 --> 35:26.678
He knows the market, though.

35:26.713 --> 35:29.173
I don't think we can
take him on a stocks deal.

35:29.213 --> 35:31.173
Twist, what about the numbers?

35:31.213 --> 35:35.553
It's run out of a packing
house on 14th by a guy named Combs.

35:35.593 --> 35:38.883
Lonnegan comes out every three
weeks or so to check on it, but...

35:38.933 --> 35:42.183
he stays away from the day-to-day
stuff in case it's raided.

35:42.223 --> 35:45.223
These are two of Combs's favorite
torpedoes: Riley and Cole.

35:45.273 --> 35:48.273
You ever seen 'em?

35:48.313 --> 35:50.273
No.

35:50.313 --> 35:52.983
They're the ones who hit Luther.

35:53.023 --> 35:56.493
They also got the numbers runner
you conned: a guy named Mottola.

35:56.533 --> 35:59.913
Found him in a quarry with
a knife in his eye.

35:59.953 --> 36:03.163
Lonnegan's had seven or eight
people rubbed on his way up.

36:03.203 --> 36:06.163
His pattern has been to get
close to a racket boss...

36:06.203 --> 36:08.833
Learn the
operation, then move in on it.

36:08.873 --> 36:10.923
He's done it to
Gorman, O'Donnell, Buchalman.

36:10.963 --> 36:12.843
He took the numbers from Sharkey.

36:12.883 --> 36:17.263
All four of these guys are
dead. He's vindictive as hell, Henry.

36:17.303 --> 36:21.593
Kills for pride. Doesn't add up he'd
let Hooker get away from him.

36:21.643 --> 36:25.103
You see anything,
kid, you let us know.

36:25.143 --> 36:28.773
If they put you on the spot, we
gotta fold the con. You got that?

36:28.813 --> 36:32.523
Yeah. You sure it's
gotta be one of these two guys?

36:32.563 --> 36:35.943
Nope. They're just the
only ones we know of.

36:47.373 --> 36:49.663
Time.

36:59.473 --> 37:02.893
Set me up five more
beers, will you, Danny?

37:11.483 --> 37:14.403
- You the owner here?
- That's right.

37:14.443 --> 37:17.153
Lt. Snyder, Bunco.

37:17.193 --> 37:21.363
That's a Joliet badge,
Snyder. Don't cut much up here.

37:21.403 --> 37:23.283
Looking for a guy on the
lam from a counterfeiting rap.

37:23.323 --> 37:25.323
- Thought he might've come here.
- Don't think so.

37:25.373 --> 37:28.083
I know everyone in the place, and
I always bounce the lamsters.

37:28.123 --> 37:30.583
All right if I look around in here?

37:30.623 --> 37:34.423
No, but you're welcome to
a free beer before you go.

37:41.383 --> 37:44.183
I don't really need your permission.

37:47.893 --> 37:50.353
I don't know what
to do with this guy.

37:50.393 --> 37:51.998
He's an Irishman who doesn't drink,

37:52.033 --> 37:53.603
doesn't smoke and
doesn't chase dames.

37:53.643 --> 37:56.113
He's a grand knight in
the Knights of Columbus...

37:56.153 --> 37:58.113
and he only goes out to play faro.

37:58.153 --> 38:01.033
Sometimes plays 15, 20 hours at a
time; just him against the house.

38:01.073 --> 38:03.283
- Roulette, craps?
- He won't touch 'em.

38:03.323 --> 38:06.623
The croupier at Gilman's says he
never plays anything he can't win.

38:06.663 --> 38:07.873
Sports?

38:07.913 --> 38:10.163
He likes to be seen with
fighters sometimes...

38:10.198 --> 38:12.413
but he doesn't go to
the fights or bet on 'em.

38:12.463 --> 38:15.753
Jesus. Does he do
anything where he's not alone?

38:15.788 --> 38:18.253
Just poker.

38:18.293 --> 38:21.633
And he cheats.

38:21.673 --> 38:24.133
Pretty good at it too.

38:28.933 --> 38:31.223
Where does he play?

38:31.273 --> 38:34.233
The porters say he runs a braced
game on the Century Limited...

38:34.273 --> 38:36.563
when he comes out
here from New York.

38:36.598 --> 38:38.698
$100 minimum, straight poker.

38:38.733 --> 38:41.783
A lot of high rollers ride
that train just to play him.

38:41.823 --> 38:44.703
That sounds good, J. J.

38:50.243 --> 38:52.543
Which way are the rooms?

38:52.583 --> 38:55.463
- Who told you this guy was in here?
- Nobody.

38:55.498 --> 38:57.928
I just know what kind
of woman he likes.

38:57.963 --> 39:00.423
I'm gonna check all the
joy houses till I find him.

39:00.458 --> 39:02.883
Maybe I could help you
if you tell me his name.

39:02.923 --> 39:06.183
I doubt it. Which way are the rooms?

39:06.223 --> 39:09.893
Right through there. But I wouldn't
go in there if I were you.

39:09.933 --> 39:14.103
- What are you gonna do, call the
cops? - I don't have to.

39:14.143 --> 39:18.153
You'd be busting in on the
chief of police just up the hall.

39:27.783 --> 39:30.748
We'll play it out here. A
huge duke is too simple.

39:30.783 --> 39:33.793
With no fix, we're gonna need
a con with a surefire blow-off.

39:33.828 --> 39:36.293
I think we ought to play
this guy on the payoff.

39:36.333 --> 39:39.133
It's the tightest game we got, and
it's not all over the papers yet.

39:39.173 --> 39:40.258
Lonnegan is a fast egg.

39:40.293 --> 39:42.923
He's not going to sit
still for a standard play.

39:42.963 --> 39:46.343
What does that leave us? We
can't con the payoff to a banker.

39:46.378 --> 39:47.883
We'll use the wire.

39:47.933 --> 39:50.763
Haven't known a poker player
didn't wanna beat the ponies.

39:50.803 --> 39:52.813
The wire's been out
of date for ten years.

39:52.853 --> 39:54.813
That's why he won't know it.

39:54.848 --> 39:56.893
I'm not sure I know it.

39:56.933 --> 39:59.483
It'll take two of
us working the inside.

39:59.523 --> 40:02.523
Any objections to
Hooker as second man?

40:04.863 --> 40:06.073
All right.

40:06.113 --> 40:09.863
We'll give Lonnegan the hook
on the train and play him here.

40:09.913 --> 40:11.953
J. J., you think I can
get in that poker game?

40:11.993 --> 40:14.663
Just show up with a lot of
money and look like a sucker.

40:14.698 --> 40:16.798
I also gotta win.

40:16.833 --> 40:21.543
By the way, any of you guys been
passing bad money lately?

40:24.503 --> 40:27.763
If he comes in again, stall
him so I can get a look at him.

40:41.523 --> 40:44.653
Fella by the name of Stenner had this
place 'til about six months ago...

40:44.693 --> 40:47.153
but he had to give it up.

40:47.193 --> 40:50.993
It doesn't look so good, but maybe
you can fix it up a little bit.

40:51.033 --> 40:54.993
Watch your step when you come
in. There's a dip down to the left.

41:09.513 --> 41:12.473
- How does it look, Eddie?
- It looks all right, Kid.

41:12.513 --> 41:15.303
It's big enough, and
it's off the street.

41:15.353 --> 41:19.313
It's kind of short notice. I'm not
sure we can get it done by Saturday.

41:19.353 --> 41:23.903
Got to. Gondorff's riding the mark
down from New York on the Century.

41:23.943 --> 41:26.693
We'll take it. That building at the
end of the alley, do you manage that?

41:26.733 --> 41:28.233
For 15 years.

41:28.283 --> 41:30.248
I'll need a corner
room facing this way.

41:30.283 --> 41:32.928
- How much a week?
- Only rents by the month.

41:32.963 --> 41:35.573
Two hundred and
fifty for the two of them.

41:35.623 --> 41:37.743
Last time I expect to
see you down here.

41:37.778 --> 41:39.663
Never heard of the place.

41:39.703 --> 41:42.253
It's been a while since
I stocked the wire store.

41:42.293 --> 41:44.583
Not many mobs playing that anymore.

41:44.633 --> 41:47.058
All we'll need is the
bookie setup for now.

41:47.093 --> 41:50.463
I'll rent you everything I got
in the warehouse for two grand.

41:50.513 --> 41:54.803
That'll give you phones,
cages, blackboards and ticker gear.

41:54.843 --> 41:57.973
If you want a counter and
bar, that's another grand.

41:58.013 --> 42:01.813
- That's pretty steep, Benny.
- Gondorff's still a hot item.

42:01.853 --> 42:04.853
- Where would I be if he gets hit?
- Just give us what you can.

42:04.903 --> 42:07.483
We'll send a truck.
How do you want to work this?

42:07.518 --> 42:08.788
Flat rate or percentage?

42:08.823 --> 42:11.323
- Who's the mark?
- Doyle Lonnegan.

42:14.953 --> 42:17.163
Flat rate.

42:32.133 --> 42:35.553
The guy in the black
hat with the gimp.

42:44.143 --> 42:46.693
He's not as tough as he thinks.

42:46.733 --> 42:48.693
Neither are we.

42:52.653 --> 42:54.653
- Mr. Shaw?
- Right.

42:54.703 --> 42:56.668
You wanted to see me?

42:56.703 --> 42:58.493
I hear there's a friendly
poker game on this train.

42:58.528 --> 42:59.493
You know anything about it?

42:59.533 --> 43:01.493
- Oh, a little.
- Thank you, sir.

43:01.543 --> 43:04.163
- Can you get me in that game?
- Oh, I don't know.

43:04.198 --> 43:06.503
There's usually a waiting list.

43:09.793 --> 43:12.173
That'll get you first
alternate, sir.

43:17.763 --> 43:19.723
I'll see what I can do.

43:22.853 --> 43:24.933
Twist!

43:24.983 --> 43:28.103
- Patty, me boy! How are you?
- How are you, Twist?

43:28.153 --> 43:30.443
Champ, you're
lookin' like a million!

43:30.483 --> 43:32.443
Good to see you!

43:32.483 --> 43:35.113
Goldie, you old son of a gun.

43:35.153 --> 43:38.203
I saw the Kid in Denver. He
says to say hello to you.

43:38.243 --> 43:40.283
Joiner, are you still
workin' those shapes?

43:40.323 --> 43:42.543
Any number you want, Twist!

43:42.583 --> 43:45.478
- Good to see you again.
- Okay, Lacey. Good to see you.

43:45.513 --> 43:48.373
- It's good to see you. Come on in!
- Dukey, how are you?

43:48.423 --> 43:51.463
- When did you get back in town?
- A couple of days ago.

43:51.503 --> 43:53.848
You heard about Luther
Coleman, didn't you?

43:53.883 --> 43:57.343
Yeah. Some of the boys were passin'
the hat for Alva and the kids.

43:57.378 --> 44:00.803
- I never seen the guys so worked up.
- Don't worry about it, Dukey.

44:00.853 --> 44:03.563
We're gonna send a
little calling card of our own.

44:03.603 --> 44:05.853
Gondorff is setting up a wire store.

44:05.893 --> 44:07.853
I'm gonna need a
20-man boost right away.

44:07.893 --> 44:11.193
I got plenty of talent out
there tonight. Take your pick. Lace!

44:11.233 --> 44:14.983
This is a tough one. These
boys have got to be the quill.

44:15.033 --> 44:18.743
Get me the sheet. Let's
see who's in town.

44:18.783 --> 44:21.163
Patty, give me the sheet.

44:21.203 --> 44:22.913
Sure.

44:38.923 --> 44:41.053
Gondorff's
already on...

44:49.773 --> 44:52.063
Twist, you know this guy?

44:56.233 --> 44:59.783
No, I never saw him
before. He's a dick, though.

45:10.003 --> 45:12.213
Hello, Snyder.

45:12.253 --> 45:15.293
- What are you doin' up here?
- I'm on vacation.

45:15.343 --> 45:17.963
You seen that
friend of yours lately?

45:18.013 --> 45:19.978
No, no. He packed it in.

45:20.013 --> 45:24.013
Enrolled in detective school.

45:30.143 --> 45:32.103
If you see him...

45:32.143 --> 45:35.943
you tell him he better
pay up before I get to him.

45:45.623 --> 45:47.583
That son of a bitch.

45:50.253 --> 45:52.213
Thanks, Lace.

45:52.253 --> 45:54.213
Let's see what we got here.

45:54.253 --> 45:56.793
Horse Face Lee, Slim Miller...

45:56.843 --> 46:01.053
Suitcase Murphy and the Big
Alabama are in from New Orleans.

46:01.088 --> 46:04.425
Cryin' Jonesy and the
Boone Kid from Denver.

46:04.460 --> 46:07.763
Dippy Burke and Limehouse
Chappie from New York.

46:07.813 --> 46:11.813
These and the guys outside should
give you 30 or more to choose from.

46:11.853 --> 46:13.813
Good, Dukey.

46:13.853 --> 46:16.363
Have them down at
Stenner's old pool hall before 6:00.

46:16.403 --> 46:18.443
We're gonna run the route tonight.

46:18.483 --> 46:20.823
Okay, Twist, but...

46:20.863 --> 46:23.993
if this thing blows up, remember,
I can't do you no good downtown.

46:24.033 --> 46:25.993
Gondorff is federal.

46:26.033 --> 46:28.708
Dukey, if this thing blows up...

46:28.743 --> 46:31.413
the feds will be the
least of our problems.

46:47.763 --> 46:49.683
Yeah?

46:52.063 --> 46:54.528
- You in?
- Yeah, I think so.

46:54.563 --> 46:57.273
I gave the kayducer a
C- note. Did you find out the deck?

46:57.313 --> 47:00.113
He usually plays with a
Tallyho Fan or a Tallyho Circle.

47:00.153 --> 47:02.193
I got you one of each.

47:02.233 --> 47:05.613
He likes to cold-deck
low, eights or nines.

47:05.653 --> 47:08.373
That's nice work, J. J. Here.

47:31.853 --> 47:34.233
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't mention it, ma'am.

48:00.713 --> 48:04.803
- He'd like to join us.
- Yes, Clyde is a member of our firm.

48:27.453 --> 48:30.073
She picked him
clean. He never missed it.

48:31.623 --> 48:34.623
My God, it looks like he's
expecting a big night.

48:34.663 --> 48:37.083
Must be 15, 20 grand here.

48:38.163 --> 48:40.123
He's waiting for
you in the card room.

48:40.173 --> 48:42.673
Let him wait.

49:26.843 --> 49:30.383
Just worry about your end, kid.

49:30.423 --> 49:33.223
If we ever get to it.

49:35.053 --> 49:37.188
Excuse me.

49:37.223 --> 49:39.393
You sure you checked this guy out?

49:39.433 --> 49:41.908
He seemed like a pleasant
man; a lot of cash on him.

49:41.943 --> 49:44.943
Two-hundred-dollar suit, expensive
luggage. I'll vouch for him.

49:44.978 --> 49:46.960
Why isn't he here then?

49:46.995 --> 49:48.943
Don't worry. He'll be here.

49:48.983 --> 49:50.443
All right.

50:00.873 --> 50:02.833
What're you doin'?

50:05.383 --> 50:10.553
Always drink gin with a mark,
kid. He can't tell if you cut it.

50:10.593 --> 50:12.473
Two thousand for you, Mr. Clayton?

50:12.513 --> 50:13.553
Thank you.

50:13.593 --> 50:16.263
All right, gentlemen. Should
we not wait for him?

50:16.298 --> 50:17.108
Let's go.

50:17.143 --> 50:18.873
I think that's a good idea.

50:18.908 --> 50:20.603
Mr. Clemens, give me the cards.

50:29.693 --> 50:31.743
Sorry I'm late,
guys. I was takin' a crap.

50:31.783 --> 50:34.573
The name's Shaw.

50:34.613 --> 50:38.243
Mr. Shaw, meet Mr.
Jameson from Chicago.

50:38.283 --> 50:41.003
Mr. Lombard from Philadelphia.

50:41.043 --> 50:43.753
- And Mr. Lonnegan from New York.
- Pleased to meet you.

50:43.793 --> 50:45.928
Mr. Clayton, Pittsburgh.

50:45.963 --> 50:50.343
Any of you guys want to make a little
book in Chicago, I'm the guy to see.

50:50.383 --> 50:52.343
Game is straight poker...

50:52.383 --> 50:54.763
$100 minimum, table stakes.

50:56.803 --> 50:59.013
Mr. Shaw, this is
a gentleman's game.

50:59.063 --> 51:02.488
We assume you're all
good for your debts.

51:02.523 --> 51:05.983
- How much would you like, Mr. Shaw?
- I'll start with 5,000.

51:11.233 --> 51:13.783
Mr. Shaw, we usually
require a tie at this table.

51:13.823 --> 51:16.368
If you don't have
one, we can get you one.

51:16.403 --> 51:18.913
Hey, that'd be real nice
of you, Mr. Lonneman.

51:18.953 --> 51:20.743
Lonnegan.

51:36.093 --> 51:39.553
Name's Curly Jackson. Worked
for Gad Bryan outta Baldwin.

51:39.603 --> 51:42.063
Jackson?

51:42.103 --> 51:44.733
Jackson, Jackson. Oh, yeah.

51:44.773 --> 51:46.983
Ever play the wire, Curly?

51:47.023 --> 51:51.023
Roped for it long ago. I can
shill, mark board, anything you want.

51:51.058 --> 51:53.693
I don't run with riffraff, and
I only drink on weekends.

51:54.743 --> 51:57.363
Me specialty's an Englishman.

51:59.033 --> 52:02.703
We got a rack of suits over there.
Pick yourself a nice tweed one.

52:02.743 --> 52:05.833
That's all right. I've
got all my own stuff.

52:11.383 --> 52:13.653
Doyle?

52:13.688 --> 52:15.350
One.

52:15.385 --> 52:17.013
Bill?

52:18.053 --> 52:20.013
I'll take one.

52:21.183 --> 52:23.143
- Shaw?
- Three.

52:25.223 --> 52:28.443
And the dealer will take one.

52:33.823 --> 52:35.783
Bet 500.

52:37.613 --> 52:39.993
I'll call.

52:41.243 --> 52:44.378
Call and raise.

52:44.413 --> 52:46.413
- Three hundred.
- I'm out.

52:46.448 --> 52:48.413
Fold.

52:52.253 --> 52:54.253
Your three...

52:55.253 --> 52:58.303
and raise... 500.

53:00.513 --> 53:02.473
That's eight to me.

53:06.933 --> 53:08.893
Call.

53:11.853 --> 53:14.523
Jacks on top.

53:14.573 --> 53:16.533
Beats me.

53:19.283 --> 53:21.703
Three tens.

53:26.623 --> 53:28.588
Tough luck, Lonnihan.

53:28.623 --> 53:31.463
But that's what you get for
playing with your head up your ass.

53:31.498 --> 53:34.753
Couple more like that, we
can all go to bed early.

53:36.253 --> 53:39.473
The name's Lonnegan. Doyle Lonnegan.

53:39.508 --> 53:40.938
You're gonna remember that...

53:40.973 --> 53:43.763
or you're gonna get
yourself another game.

53:43.803 --> 53:45.763
You follow?

53:51.483 --> 53:53.653
Bring it right up here!

53:55.443 --> 53:58.863
Eddie, we brought you a
tap into Moe Anenberg's wire.

53:58.898 --> 54:01.453
You'll get race
results, odds, scratches,

54:01.488 --> 54:03.128
pole positions, everything.

54:03.163 --> 54:05.663
And just as fast as
Western Union gets 'em.

54:05.698 --> 54:08.163
- Does J. J. know how
to use that thing?

54:08.198 --> 54:09.913
All he's gotta do is read.

54:13.003 --> 54:15.883
The name is Joe Erie.

54:15.923 --> 54:17.883
Joe Erie.

54:19.763 --> 54:22.683
You played for any particular mobs?

54:22.718 --> 54:24.518
No.

54:24.553 --> 54:27.053
- You ever play the wire before,
Erie? - No.

54:28.683 --> 54:32.273
I never played no
big con before, but...

54:32.313 --> 54:35.813
Luther Coleman was a friend
of mine, and I thought maybe...

54:35.863 --> 54:37.823
there'd be somethin' I could do.

54:39.653 --> 54:41.903
You get that nose in
Duke Boudreau's tonight?

54:45.663 --> 54:47.623
Yeah.

54:49.543 --> 54:53.043
You got moxie,
Erie. Get yourself a suit.

54:54.213 --> 54:56.583
Thanks.

55:04.263 --> 55:06.263
I'll bet three.

55:06.933 --> 55:08.933
Call and raise 200.

55:10.773 --> 55:13.313
Call.

55:15.063 --> 55:17.813
- No.
- I'm out.

55:17.863 --> 55:20.198
Call.

55:20.233 --> 55:22.823
Aces over.

55:22.863 --> 55:24.953
Three cowboys.

55:24.993 --> 55:27.993
All red, queen high.

55:28.033 --> 55:31.583
- Well, that finishes me.
- Don't worry about it, pal.

55:33.083 --> 55:35.543
They wouldn't have let you in
here if you weren't a chump!

55:35.583 --> 55:38.258
Lombard'll be joining
you in a couple of minutes.

55:38.293 --> 55:40.923
- Now, look here, Shaw... -
I've had enough of this game...

55:40.963 --> 55:43.213
and quite enough of this company.

55:43.263 --> 55:45.763
Check me out, Clemens.

55:45.803 --> 55:48.433
I guess that just
leaves the three of us.

55:48.473 --> 55:52.353
Yes, Mr. Shaw. That
just leaves us three.

55:52.393 --> 55:55.183
Mr. Clayton, I think we
should take a break for five minutes.

55:55.233 --> 55:58.023
Tempers seem to be
running a little high.

55:58.063 --> 56:00.693
Ah, come on, Linneman, I
was just startin' to do good.

56:12.243 --> 56:13.873
Stack me a cooler.

56:13.913 --> 56:15.753
We'll be in the
station in another hour.

56:15.793 --> 56:18.138
The other guys are the big
losers. You're still okay.

56:18.173 --> 56:21.503
Fix me a deck... threes and nines.
I'll cut it in on Clayton's deal.

56:21.538 --> 56:23.503
- What do you want Clayton to get?
- Nothin'.

56:23.538 --> 56:24.978
I want him outta there early.

56:25.013 --> 56:27.723
I'm gonna bust that
bastard bookie in one play.

56:31.553 --> 56:34.563
Four hundred to you,
Mr. Jameson. You're even.

56:34.603 --> 56:36.563
Well, it just wasn't my night.

56:52.833 --> 56:54.793
Oh, I need it.

56:54.833 --> 56:56.913
- You know what time we get in?
- No, I don't.

56:58.543 --> 57:00.543
Hey, where's your ante?

57:07.923 --> 57:11.593
Every time I had
anything, he stayed in front of me.

57:34.453 --> 57:36.413
Five hundred.

57:39.083 --> 57:41.623
Your five. One thousand.

57:43.383 --> 57:45.383
I'll fold.

57:46.883 --> 57:48.843
I'll play.

57:50.473 --> 57:52.433
Cards?

57:52.468 --> 57:54.393
Two.

57:58.433 --> 58:00.273
Three.

58:28.253 --> 58:30.213
Five hundred.

58:32.303 --> 58:36.263
Your five hundred, and one thousand.

58:44.193 --> 58:47.573
Your one thousand. I'll
raise you two thousand.

58:51.493 --> 58:55.823
Your two thousand.

58:58.283 --> 59:00.543
Mr. Clemens...

59:00.583 --> 59:02.623
give me $10,000 more.

59:47.883 --> 59:50.803
I'll call.

59:50.843 --> 59:53.633
Four nines.

01:00:02.813 --> 01:00:05.483
Four Jacks.

01:00:15.363 --> 01:00:17.743
You owe me 15 grand, pal.

01:00:31.883 --> 01:00:33.843
Must've left my wallet in my room.

01:00:33.883 --> 01:00:35.883
Don't hand me any of that crap!

01:00:35.923 --> 01:00:38.223
When you come to a game like
this, you bring your money!

01:00:38.258 --> 01:00:40.973
How do I know you
won't take a powder?

01:00:41.013 --> 01:00:42.813
I'll tell you what I'll do.

01:00:42.853 --> 01:00:45.273
I'll send a boy around to
your room in five minutes.

01:00:45.308 --> 01:00:46.318
You better have the money,

01:00:46.353 --> 01:00:48.813
or it's gonna be all around
Chicago that you welched.

01:00:48.853 --> 01:00:51.568
You won't be able to
get a game of jacks!

01:00:51.603 --> 01:00:54.283
Cash me in for the
rest of these bums.

01:01:09.083 --> 01:01:11.928
You're on, kid.

01:01:11.963 --> 01:01:14.593
But I gotta tell you, it's
a hard act to follow.

01:01:14.633 --> 01:01:17.593
- How'd it go?
- We got working money.

01:01:17.628 --> 01:01:19.558
- Hey?
- Yeah?

01:01:19.593 --> 01:01:21.683
- He's steamin'.
- Yeah.

01:01:21.723 --> 01:01:23.683
Watch yourself.

01:01:30.483 --> 01:01:33.693
Doyle, I know I
gave him four threes!

01:01:33.733 --> 01:01:35.693
He had to make a switch!

01:01:35.733 --> 01:01:37.693
We can't let him get away with that.

01:01:37.743 --> 01:01:41.033
What was I supposed to do? Call
him for cheating better than me?

01:02:00.263 --> 01:02:02.433
Name's Kelly. Shaw sent me.

01:02:09.853 --> 01:02:12.603
Your boss is quite a
card player, Mr. Kelly.

01:02:12.653 --> 01:02:15.823
- How does he do it?
- He cheats.

01:02:18.033 --> 01:02:21.033
In that case, I'll keep my
money, and we'll have another game.

01:02:21.073 --> 01:02:23.533
You don't have any to keep.

01:02:27.163 --> 01:02:29.873
Here's your wallet. He hired
a dame to take it from you.

01:02:31.123 --> 01:02:33.583
Shaw's been plannin' to
beat your game for months.

01:02:33.623 --> 01:02:36.133
He's been waiting for you to
cheat him so he could clip you.

01:02:38.173 --> 01:02:41.473
Who do you think you're talking
to, errand boy? Nobody sets me up!

01:02:41.513 --> 01:02:43.633
Take him back to the baggage
room! Put one in his ear!

01:02:43.683 --> 01:02:45.473
There were four
witnesses at that table!

01:02:45.513 --> 01:02:49.563
Then get that other son of a bitch
and dump 'em in the first tunnel.

01:02:49.603 --> 01:02:51.858
We're gonna be in the
station in a couple of minutes!

01:02:51.893 --> 01:02:54.943
It ain't gonna look too good killing
a guy you owe money to.

01:02:54.983 --> 01:02:59.073
There's better
ways of takin' him down.

01:03:02.783 --> 01:03:05.873
What do you think Shaw would do if
he knew I was tellin' you this?

01:03:09.243 --> 01:03:11.623
Okay.

01:03:11.663 --> 01:03:13.623
Why the rat?

01:03:20.383 --> 01:03:23.303
I wanna take over his operation, and
I need you to help me break him.

01:03:31.973 --> 01:03:34.693
- Where's my money?
- Shaw's got it.

01:03:34.733 --> 01:03:37.613
How the hell could I
ask him for it back?

01:03:37.648 --> 01:03:40.693
We're pullin' in.

01:03:46.743 --> 01:03:48.743
I'm givin' you a lift home.

01:03:50.583 --> 01:03:53.293
- I was supposed to go with Shaw.
- Explain it to him somehow.

01:03:53.328 --> 01:03:56.673
- But he's expecting me.
- I'm givin' you a lift home.

01:03:56.713 --> 01:03:58.673
You follow?

01:04:02.093 --> 01:04:05.303
Yeah, sure. Sure thing.

01:04:28.953 --> 01:04:30.953
What makes you
think you can beat him?

01:04:30.988 --> 01:04:32.918
I've been planning
this for two years.

01:04:32.953 --> 01:04:35.258
I know his organization
backwards and forwards...

01:04:35.293 --> 01:04:38.173
and I need somebody who's
respectable but not completely legit.

01:04:38.208 --> 01:04:40.213
I'm a banker, Kelly. That's
legit in this state.

01:04:40.253 --> 01:04:43.138
All you gotta do is put down
a bet for me at Shaw's place.

01:04:43.173 --> 01:04:47.133
I'll do the rest. I'll supply the
money. I'll supply the information.

01:04:47.168 --> 01:04:49.263
What about the
money you come to collect?

01:04:49.303 --> 01:04:52.183
I'll tell him you paid it. I
keep his books. He trusts me.

01:04:52.223 --> 01:04:55.143
If you help me, I'll pay back the
money he stole out of my own pocket.

01:04:55.178 --> 01:04:58.205
- It's worth that much to you?
- Yeah.

01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:01.233
Oh, yeah. Maybe a couple of million.

01:05:07.823 --> 01:05:10.958
Where do you come from, Kelly?

01:05:10.993 --> 01:05:14.913
From the east side of New
York. A place called Five Points.

01:05:14.953 --> 01:05:19.503
- But I got out of there.
- Out and up, huh?

01:05:20.543 --> 01:05:23.463
Hey, Floyd? I'm gonna have to
keep you away from this guy.

01:05:23.503 --> 01:05:25.503
You're liable to get ideas.

01:05:43.693 --> 01:05:45.828
I'll be at Klein's Drug Store...

01:05:45.863 --> 01:05:49.613
660 South Marshall at
1:30, if you're interested.

01:05:49.653 --> 01:05:53.373
If I'm not there by quarter
to 2:00, I'm not comin'.

01:07:06.363 --> 01:07:08.483
Hey, Hooker, how'd it go?

01:07:08.523 --> 01:07:10.483
Jake.

01:07:12.153 --> 01:07:15.283
- Everything go okay?
- Yeah, sure. Hell, easy.

01:07:25.373 --> 01:07:27.673
- No sign of trouble, huh?
- No.

01:07:27.713 --> 01:07:30.423
- What about Lonnegan? - I gave him
the breakdown like you said.

01:07:30.463 --> 01:07:32.973
- And? - He's good.
He threatened to kill me.

01:07:33.013 --> 01:07:37.433
Hell, kid, if they don't do that,
you know you're not gettin' to 'em.

01:07:54.783 --> 01:07:57.168
Hello, Doyle.

01:07:57.203 --> 01:07:59.533
All right, Riley, what
the hell happened?

01:07:59.568 --> 01:08:01.793
We missed him.

01:08:01.833 --> 01:08:04.333
Whoever he is, he
made a fool out of you.

01:08:04.373 --> 01:08:06.963
There was no way he
could've known we was in that room.

01:08:07.003 --> 01:08:09.293
Somebody must've wised him up.

01:08:09.343 --> 01:08:11.593
What does Cole say about that?

01:08:11.633 --> 01:08:13.593
I don't know. He took it hard.

01:08:13.633 --> 01:08:15.723
Get out of here, Riley.

01:08:16.763 --> 01:08:18.843
Put Salino onto it.

01:08:18.893 --> 01:08:22.723
Salino? Why waste our best
people on a small-time job?

01:08:22.773 --> 01:08:25.337
This is a nickel-and-dime
grifter we're after, Doyle.

01:08:25.372 --> 01:08:27.903
- They'll get him next time.
- They had their chance.

01:08:27.943 --> 01:08:30.733
All they did was shoot up a
neighborhood, wake up a few cops.

01:08:30.773 --> 01:08:33.903
I told you to put Salino onto it.

01:08:33.943 --> 01:08:37.033
It may take a little more
time, but there won't be any holes.

01:08:37.068 --> 01:08:39.743
Tell Cole I wanna see
him when he comes in.

01:08:39.783 --> 01:08:43.412
He won't be comin' in; not to
get bounced off a job anyway.

01:08:43.453 --> 01:08:46.082
This is Salino's job, Vince.

01:08:46.122 --> 01:08:48.752
Cole wants to muscle
in, that's his business.

01:08:48.792 --> 01:08:51.173
But he's breakin' the
rules and Salino won't like it.

01:08:51.212 --> 01:08:53.212
Now, get me the books.

01:09:32.423 --> 01:09:35.923
Those odds on the
third race are wrong.

01:09:35.957 --> 01:09:38.133
Just a minute. I'll get 'em.

01:09:38.173 --> 01:09:41.468
Don't worry so much. You're
gonna be all right.

01:09:41.502 --> 01:09:44.763
Just stay to the back
the first time around.

01:09:47.273 --> 01:09:50.273
Put a little of this on your nose.

01:10:33.353 --> 01:10:35.363
Kelly?

01:10:39.743 --> 01:10:42.628
You should always
look to the back, kid.

01:10:42.663 --> 01:10:45.323
I was afraid you wasn't gonna
show. We haven't got much time.

01:10:45.373 --> 01:10:48.203
Get on with it, then.

01:10:48.243 --> 01:10:50.203
Sometime after 2:00...

01:10:50.253 --> 01:10:54.833
a guy's gonna call on that phone
and give you the name of a horse.

01:10:54.868 --> 01:10:57.923
All you gotta do is take
this two grand across the street...

01:10:57.963 --> 01:11:01.473
to Shaw's place, and
bet it on that pony.

01:11:01.513 --> 01:11:02.728
Don't take too much time.

01:11:02.763 --> 01:11:05.593
We've only got four minutes
after you get the call.

01:11:05.643 --> 01:11:08.358
You'll not break
him with a $2,000 bet.

01:11:08.393 --> 01:11:10.933
This is just a test. The
big one comes later.

01:11:10.983 --> 01:11:13.443
Be careful with
that. That's all I got.

01:11:13.483 --> 01:11:15.903
You were gonna pay me
back out of your own pocket?

01:11:15.938 --> 01:11:18.903
I am. After the race.

01:11:18.943 --> 01:11:22.453
I gotta get back before
Shaw misses me. Good luck.

01:12:18.673 --> 01:12:21.218
Yeah? Go ahead.

01:12:21.253 --> 01:12:23.673
The horse is Blue Note to win.

01:12:23.713 --> 01:12:26.263
- Fourth race at Narragansett.
- Got it.

01:12:47.953 --> 01:12:49.913
Yeah?

01:12:49.953 --> 01:12:53.453
Blue Note to win in the
fourth race at Narragansett.

01:13:29.913 --> 01:13:32.493
Turning for home, it's
Lady Scout by a length.

01:13:32.533 --> 01:13:35.373
Speed Queen a half, Lady
Trust and Miss Petrina.

01:13:35.413 --> 01:13:39.463
Into the stretch, it's Lady
Scout ahead, Speed Queen a half.

01:13:39.503 --> 01:13:42.568
And at the wire, it's
Speed Queen the winner!

01:13:42.603 --> 01:13:45.633
Lady Scout placed and
Miss Petrina showed.

01:13:45.673 --> 01:13:48.303
Post numbers two, five and one.

01:13:48.343 --> 01:13:50.303
Taking off at 23.

01:13:50.343 --> 01:13:52.303
Look at that.

01:13:53.393 --> 01:13:55.393
He's got his apes with him.

01:13:57.023 --> 01:14:00.603
Yeah, we're gonna have
to do something about that.

01:14:00.643 --> 01:14:04.648
Bubblesome is 10, Beefsteak, 7...

01:14:04.683 --> 01:14:08.653
Vote Boy, 6, Kerry Patch, 12.

01:14:08.693 --> 01:14:12.038
Blue Note is 7 to 1.

01:14:12.073 --> 01:14:14.873
This is your last call for the
third race at Lincoln Fields.

01:14:14.908 --> 01:14:17.008
They're going to the post.

01:14:17.043 --> 01:14:20.713
- You may still wager if you hurry.
- There he goes.

01:14:23.133 --> 01:14:26.923
At Detroit, the winner,
Speed Queen, paid $7.20...

01:14:26.958 --> 01:14:29.018
4.60 and 3.40.

01:14:29.053 --> 01:14:31.473
Lady Scout, $7 and 4.20.

01:14:31.513 --> 01:14:33.933
Miss Petrina paid four dollars.

01:14:33.973 --> 01:14:38.933
Last flash at
Narragansett. Lady Higloss, 6 to 5.

01:14:41.443 --> 01:14:43.563
I'd think you'd get
tired of losing, Harrigan.

01:14:43.598 --> 01:14:46.823
Thank you, Mr. Williams.

01:14:46.863 --> 01:14:49.363
Blue Note, $2,000 to win.

01:14:49.403 --> 01:14:51.363
Fourth race, Narragansett.

01:14:51.403 --> 01:14:53.363
Make sure you see the cash, Eddie.

01:14:53.413 --> 01:14:56.493
He's got a name for bettin'
money he doesn't have.

01:14:56.533 --> 01:14:58.743
We'll give you the
results on that one in a minute.

01:14:58.778 --> 01:15:00.793
Ladies and
gentlemen, this is Arnold Rowe...

01:15:00.833 --> 01:15:02.463
your caller for the fourth race.

01:15:02.503 --> 01:15:06.793
The mile and one-sixteenth handicap
at Narragansett Park, Rhode Island.

01:15:06.843 --> 01:15:10.133
Thirteen thousand dollars added
for three-year-olds and up.

01:15:10.173 --> 01:15:14.263
The flag is up, and
they're off and running.

01:15:14.303 --> 01:15:17.603
It's Bubblesome going to the
front, followed by Lady Higloss...

01:15:17.638 --> 01:15:19.933
Vote Boy, Chancing, Beefsteak,
Kerry Patch...

01:15:19.968 --> 01:15:21.948
and Blue Note trails the field.

01:15:21.983 --> 01:15:24.563
Around the clubhouse
turn, it's Bubblesome ahead...

01:15:24.603 --> 01:15:26.813
Chancing a half, Lady
Higloss by one...

01:15:26.863 --> 01:15:29.823
followed by Vote Boy,
Beefsteak, Kerry Patch and Blue Note.

01:15:29.863 --> 01:15:31.943
Into the second turn, it's
Chancing by a length.

01:15:31.993 --> 01:15:34.663
Lady Higloss driving on
the rail and Vote Boy...

01:15:34.703 --> 01:15:37.163
followed by Bubblesome,
Beefsteak, Kerry Patch and Blue Note.

01:15:37.198 --> 01:15:39.373
Come on, Chancing!

01:15:39.413 --> 01:15:42.298
Lady Higloss a
half, Vote Boy by one.

01:15:42.333 --> 01:15:45.883
Lady Higloss is a hell of a finisher.
Chancing's gonna have to open up.

01:15:47.843 --> 01:15:50.713
Know anything about a
horse named Blue Note?

01:15:50.763 --> 01:15:54.723
He never done much. Probably in
there just to round out the field.

01:15:54.763 --> 01:15:57.853
Chancing's where you want
to have your money.

01:15:59.933 --> 01:16:02.948
Great tip you handed me, kid.

01:16:02.983 --> 01:16:05.608
- Just give him time.
- Chancing by one.

01:16:05.643 --> 01:16:08.148
And here comes Blue
Note driving on the outside!

01:16:08.183 --> 01:16:10.618
- Nice work, Erie. He loves ya.
- He's third!

01:16:10.653 --> 01:16:14.243
Chancing is shortening stride, and
now it's Lady Higloss and Blue Note.

01:16:14.283 --> 01:16:16.823
They're head to head.
They're neck and neck.

01:16:16.863 --> 01:16:19.993
It's Lady Higloss, Blue
Note; Lady Higloss, Blue Note.

01:16:20.028 --> 01:16:23.298
And Blue Note wins it by a nose!

01:16:23.333 --> 01:16:26.503
Lady Higloss is second by
three, and Chancing is third by one.

01:16:28.333 --> 01:16:31.503
Who in the blazes is Blue Note?

01:16:31.553 --> 01:16:35.553
The winner, Blue
Note, paid $16, 9.40 and $6.

01:16:35.593 --> 01:16:39.683
So you want to have your
money on Chancing, huh?

01:16:39.718 --> 01:16:42.028
Chancing paid 3.80.

01:16:42.063 --> 01:16:46.273
Time for the mile and
1/16th: 1:44 and 1.

01:16:53.363 --> 01:16:56.743
They're going to
the gate at Belmont.

01:16:56.778 --> 01:16:58.708
And here are the late odds.

01:16:58.743 --> 01:17:01.123
Those garbage men belong to you?

01:17:01.163 --> 01:17:04.583
Get 'em out of here and don't bring
'em back. This is a class joint.

01:17:04.618 --> 01:17:08.503
- Hey, you, Kelly!
- Yes, sir?

01:17:08.543 --> 01:17:11.508
Run those bums out of here.

01:17:11.543 --> 01:17:15.053
- Mr. Shaw, could l... - Don't
give me any of your lip, kid.

01:17:16.383 --> 01:17:18.343
Now, run 'em out of here.

01:17:24.643 --> 01:17:28.143
Time for the three-quarter
mile: 1:11 and 4.

01:17:28.193 --> 01:17:33.653
The winner, Panic
Relief, paid 12.40, 8.20 and $5.

01:17:33.693 --> 01:17:37.193
Barbara A., 6.20 and 4.

01:17:37.243 --> 01:17:40.533
Wilder paid four dollars.

01:17:40.573 --> 01:17:43.533
They're at the
post at Belmont at 38.

01:17:43.583 --> 01:17:46.663
We're waiting on one.
I'll call Belmont next.

01:17:47.833 --> 01:17:50.713
That's it, fellas!

01:17:54.003 --> 01:17:56.923
- I wanna repeat
that... - All right, J. J.

01:18:01.643 --> 01:18:03.643
What do you say, pal?

01:18:13.403 --> 01:18:15.233
Yeah?

01:18:19.283 --> 01:18:22.163
He's on his way.

01:18:35.173 --> 01:18:37.173
Hi, Mutt.

01:18:37.963 --> 01:18:41.093
Say, Jeff.

01:18:41.133 --> 01:18:41.938
What'd I tell you?

01:18:41.973 --> 01:18:43.763
- You got lucky once.
That's not enough.

01:18:43.803 --> 01:18:46.263
Ah, lucky, hell. I
can do it every time.

01:18:46.313 --> 01:18:50.943
- Why don't you then?
- It's better to do it all at once.

01:18:50.983 --> 01:18:53.443
We're gonna put
down 400 grand next week.

01:18:53.483 --> 01:18:55.943
At five-to-one
odds, that's two million.

01:18:55.983 --> 01:18:58.733
- Twenty percent is yours.
- Got a system, Kelly?

01:18:58.783 --> 01:19:02.703
No. You can still
lose with a system.

01:19:02.738 --> 01:19:05.283
You're past-posting, aren't you?

01:19:09.453 --> 01:19:11.338
Could be.

01:19:11.373 --> 01:19:14.583
- How?
- You're gonna stay in?

01:19:14.633 --> 01:19:16.843
Not 'til I get some answers.

01:19:21.513 --> 01:19:24.053
I got a partner downtown.

01:19:24.093 --> 01:19:26.553
He runs the central
office of the Western Union.

01:19:26.603 --> 01:19:28.603
Race results from all
over the country...

01:19:28.643 --> 01:19:31.233
come in and go across
his desk to the bookies.

01:19:31.273 --> 01:19:34.103
All he does is hold 'em
up 'til he can call us,

01:19:34.138 --> 01:19:35.903
get a bet down on the winner.

01:19:35.943 --> 01:19:38.073
Then he releases the
results to the bookies.

01:19:38.113 --> 01:19:41.113
We clean up on a race that's already
been run. You can't miss.

01:19:41.153 --> 01:19:43.113
Unless the Western Union
dicks get a hold of it.

01:19:52.253 --> 01:19:54.583
You got the 400 grand yet?

01:19:54.623 --> 01:19:57.173
No, not
yet, but...

01:19:57.213 --> 01:20:01.053
- There's only a grand here.
- Make another bet tomorrow.

01:20:01.088 --> 01:20:03.018
Where's my money?

01:20:03.053 --> 01:20:05.343
- I got 16 grand coming.
- You owe me 15 grand already.

01:20:05.383 --> 01:20:08.053
If your setup's as good as you say
it is, there's plenty more to come.

01:20:08.103 --> 01:20:09.688
I decide when to place the bets!

01:20:09.723 --> 01:20:11.773
Not if you want me
to keep making 'em.

01:20:11.813 --> 01:20:14.853
I gotta talk to my partner. We
can't afford to expose too much.

01:20:14.893 --> 01:20:16.853
- I'll talk to him myself.
- No!

01:20:16.903 --> 01:20:20.613
You've been waiting a long time for
this. Don't ruin it for yourself.

01:20:20.653 --> 01:20:24.743
I'll pick you up
tomorrow at 3:00. You follow?

01:20:58.103 --> 01:21:00.693
Twist, I told him the
tale, but he didn't go for it.

01:21:00.733 --> 01:21:02.693
He wants to see my
partner tomorrow at 3:00.

01:21:02.733 --> 01:21:04.693
- 3:00?
- Yeah.

01:21:04.743 --> 01:21:06.223
We can't get a
telegraph store set up.

01:21:06.258 --> 01:21:07.703
Any chance of talking him out of it?

01:21:07.743 --> 01:21:10.283
None. I would've stalled him, but I
didn't have many friends in the room.

01:21:10.323 --> 01:21:13.453
Yeah. All right, we'll
have to play him on the fly.

01:21:13.488 --> 01:21:15.418
I'll get Eddie looking for a place.

01:21:15.453 --> 01:21:18.503
- Let me know when you got something.
- Sure thing, tootsie.

01:21:19.383 --> 01:21:21.343
All right, Hooker!

01:21:29.143 --> 01:21:31.143
Stop him!

01:22:41.333 --> 01:22:44.348
Hooker! Hooker!

01:22:44.383 --> 01:22:47.303
I'll get you, you rat!

01:22:54.513 --> 01:22:56.973
Why didn't you tell
me about Snyder before?

01:22:57.013 --> 01:22:59.143
- I thought I'd lost him.
- You found him again.

01:22:59.183 --> 01:23:01.853
We're gonna have to do
something about it.

01:23:01.893 --> 01:23:04.903
- What else haven't you been
telling me? - Nothin'. That's all.

01:23:04.938 --> 01:23:06.983
Hold still.

01:23:07.023 --> 01:23:09.783
Why'd you move out of your room?

01:23:09.823 --> 01:23:11.783
It was too noisy.

01:23:11.823 --> 01:23:15.493
You can't play your
friends like marks, Hooker.

01:23:15.533 --> 01:23:18.333
You know how easy it would be
for Lonnegan's guys to get you?

01:23:18.373 --> 01:23:20.333
All we need is a couple of days...

01:23:20.373 --> 01:23:23.503
and we can get the son
of a bitch and nail him.

01:23:23.543 --> 01:23:26.093
You just won't learn, will ya?

01:23:26.133 --> 01:23:29.463
I come in here, teach you stuff that
maybe five guys in the world know.

01:23:29.498 --> 01:23:31.973
Stuff most grifters couldn't
do even if they knew it.

01:23:32.008 --> 01:23:33.883
- All you wanna do
is run down a bullet.

01:23:33.918 --> 01:23:35.780
I'm askin' a couple of days.

01:23:35.815 --> 01:23:37.643
I can stay clear that long!

01:23:39.473 --> 01:23:42.603
Christ, they'll
probably miss you and hit me.

01:24:18.683 --> 01:24:20.893
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:24:20.933 --> 01:24:24.353
What'll you have?

01:24:24.393 --> 01:24:26.853
Give me the blue plate special.

01:24:26.888 --> 01:24:29.613
One blue plate special.

01:24:59.353 --> 01:25:01.313
- You're done?
- Yeah.

01:25:01.353 --> 01:25:04.183
- Guess I should've
had the meat loaf.

01:25:04.218 --> 01:25:05.813
It isn't any better.

01:25:08.403 --> 01:25:10.983
- Hey, where's June?
- She quit.

01:25:11.023 --> 01:25:13.323
I'm fillin' in for
her a couple of days...

01:25:13.363 --> 01:25:15.323
until I can get a train out of here.

01:25:15.363 --> 01:25:17.323
Yeah? Where are you going?

01:25:17.363 --> 01:25:20.623
I don't know. Depends
on what train I get on.

01:25:25.913 --> 01:25:29.253
- Keep it.
- Thanks.

01:25:45.563 --> 01:25:47.563
Let's go.

01:26:09.583 --> 01:26:12.633
Excuse me, ma'am, but
we're looking for Mr...

01:26:12.673 --> 01:26:14.633
- Harmon.
- Mr. Harmon's office.

01:26:14.673 --> 01:26:16.558
- Mr. Harmon?
- Yeah.

01:26:16.593 --> 01:26:18.728
Got a work order for a painting job.

01:26:18.763 --> 01:26:20.933
- For Mr. Harmon's office?
- That's right, ma'am.

01:26:20.968 --> 01:26:23.433
Well, hold on. Just a second.

01:26:38.113 --> 01:26:40.243
Hiya.

01:26:40.283 --> 01:26:43.413
- Where to?
- 110 South Wabash.

01:26:43.448 --> 01:26:46.543
110 South Wabash. Get going.

01:26:48.413 --> 01:26:50.373
What happened to your face?

01:26:50.413 --> 01:26:53.173
Ah, got into a fight with
a raggle down on 13th.

01:26:53.213 --> 01:26:55.098
Cut me with her ring.

01:26:55.133 --> 01:26:57.598
You oughta lay off the skirts.

01:26:57.633 --> 01:27:01.723
You don't find any of my boys messin'
around with that kind of trash.

01:27:09.773 --> 01:27:13.853
Brigham signed it, all right. I can't
understand why he didn't tell me.

01:27:13.903 --> 01:27:16.073
Ah, he's like all them supervisors.

01:27:16.113 --> 01:27:18.233
They think they're too
good for regular people.

01:27:18.283 --> 01:27:21.073
He says he was in here a while
ago and the place was a mess.

01:27:21.113 --> 01:27:23.453
We'll hurry so we don't
keep you out too long.

01:27:23.493 --> 01:27:25.453
Why can't I work with you in here?

01:27:25.493 --> 01:27:27.038
We gotta cover the
floor, the furniture,

01:27:27.073 --> 01:27:28.583
everything so we
don't spill on nothin'.

01:27:28.623 --> 01:27:30.833
If you want to sit in here
with a tarp over your head,

01:27:30.868 --> 01:27:31.753
you're welcome to it.

01:27:31.793 --> 01:27:34.583
- How long will you be?
- An hour or two at the most.

01:27:34.633 --> 01:27:36.593
It's a small job.

01:28:22.513 --> 01:28:24.973
We'll go in the side door here.

01:28:36.063 --> 01:28:38.193
Hiya, Les.

01:28:38.233 --> 01:28:39.903
Les, this is Doyle Lonnegan.

01:28:39.943 --> 01:28:42.323
- Mr. Lonnegan, this is Les Harmon.
- How do you do?

01:28:42.363 --> 01:28:44.283
What did you bring him here for?

01:28:44.323 --> 01:28:46.573
I thought it would be a good
idea for him to see the operation.

01:28:46.608 --> 01:28:49.703
I'm having the place
painted. We can't talk in here now.

01:28:51.743 --> 01:28:54.753
We'll have to find someplace
else. Excuse me, Mr. Lonnegan.

01:28:58.833 --> 01:29:02.303
Miss Barnes, I'm going
home a little early.

01:29:02.338 --> 01:29:04.053
If there are any calls...

01:29:04.093 --> 01:29:07.473
tell them they can reach
me here tomorrow morning.

01:29:07.513 --> 01:29:09.683
Mr. Lonnegan?

01:29:41.593 --> 01:29:43.553
I wanna see it one more time.

01:29:43.593 --> 01:29:47.013
I can't do it. We got telegraph
inspectors all over the place.

01:29:47.053 --> 01:29:49.013
One more time isn't
gonna make much difference.

01:29:49.053 --> 01:29:51.893
We got 400 grand coming in
from the coast next week.

01:29:51.933 --> 01:29:54.353
You gonna risk
that on a lousy 15 G's?

01:29:54.393 --> 01:29:57.603
If it works again tomorrow,
I'll finance the whole thing.

01:29:57.643 --> 01:30:00.943
Half a million
dollars. Sixty-forty, we split.

01:30:00.983 --> 01:30:04.483
What are you talking... We've already
got a guy. He's gonna give us half.

01:30:04.533 --> 01:30:08.033
- What am I supposed to say to him?
- Say to him what you want.

01:30:08.073 --> 01:30:10.533
What I know about your
operation, if I were you...

01:30:10.573 --> 01:30:12.743
I'd be worried about
making me happy.

01:30:12.783 --> 01:30:15.543
Your guy says a week. How do
we know it won't be a month?

01:30:15.583 --> 01:30:16.628
Lonnegan here's a banker.

01:30:16.663 --> 01:30:18.968
He can get the money
without any questions asked.

01:30:19.003 --> 01:30:22.003
We can't keep goin' into Shaw's
place and cleanin' up on long shots.

01:30:22.038 --> 01:30:25.463
- He's bound to get wise.
- All right. We'll go for short odds.

01:30:25.763 --> 01:30:27.803
You follow?

01:30:48.363 --> 01:30:50.363
Are you Lieutenant William Snyder?

01:30:52.203 --> 01:30:54.493
I don't know. What's up?

01:30:54.533 --> 01:30:56.793
F. B. I.

01:30:56.833 --> 01:30:59.793
Special Agent Polk would
like a few words with you.

01:30:59.833 --> 01:31:01.793
You got a couple of minutes?

01:31:01.833 --> 01:31:03.793
Yeah, sure.

01:31:30.493 --> 01:31:33.418
No, no, no. It's got to
be south of the river.

01:31:33.453 --> 01:31:38.413
Probably this section in here.
31st, 39th, Morgan and Halstead.

01:31:38.448 --> 01:31:41.378
Now, that's this section here.

01:31:41.413 --> 01:31:46.003
Now, let's break it into
two sections along 35th.

01:31:46.043 --> 01:31:49.423
What the hell is
this? I got work to do.

01:31:49.458 --> 01:31:51.843
Sit down and shut up, will ya?

01:31:51.883 --> 01:31:55.933
Try not to live up to
all my expectations.

01:31:55.968 --> 01:31:57.728
Take two men with you.

01:31:57.763 --> 01:32:00.643
Work your way south from
31st to 35th, Morgan and Halstead.

01:32:00.683 --> 01:32:04.153
Go into every place and
let me know what you find.

01:32:10.233 --> 01:32:14.363
We've been told you know a
hustle artist named Johnny Hooker.

01:32:14.413 --> 01:32:17.123
- You know him, or don't you?
- Yeah, but I don't know where he is.

01:32:17.163 --> 01:32:21.663
Well, we do. He's chumming around
with a big C named Henry Gondorff.

01:32:21.703 --> 01:32:23.663
Ring any bells?

01:32:23.713 --> 01:32:26.173
Every bunco man in the
country knows Gondorff.

01:32:26.213 --> 01:32:30.383
Well, there's word he's gonna
run a con on the South Side here.

01:32:30.423 --> 01:32:33.633
We've got a year-old Florida
warrant on him, but it's a thin beef.

01:32:33.673 --> 01:32:37.553
He can beat it in court
unless we catch him cold.

01:32:37.603 --> 01:32:40.393
All we want you to do is
pick up Hooker for us.

01:32:40.433 --> 01:32:43.063
Why don't you pick him up yourself?

01:32:43.103 --> 01:32:44.938
If word gets out the
feds are in on it,

01:32:44.973 --> 01:32:46.773
Gondorff will fold
up the whole thing.

01:32:46.813 --> 01:32:49.323
Wouldn't that be too bad?

01:32:49.363 --> 01:32:53.783
Then you'd have to move out of
this nice office you've got here.

01:32:55.033 --> 01:32:57.788
Don't crack wise with me, flatfoot.

01:32:57.823 --> 01:33:01.243
I spent too much time in dumps
like this eating Gondorff's dust...

01:33:01.293 --> 01:33:04.913
while you guys in the bunco
squads get rich tipping him off!

01:33:04.963 --> 01:33:07.638
That's not gonna happen this time.

01:33:07.673 --> 01:33:10.713
We're not gonna tell
the police we're here.

01:33:10.748 --> 01:33:12.670
You keep your mouth
shut and do a job,

01:33:12.705 --> 01:33:14.593
there'll be reward
bucks in it for you.

01:33:14.633 --> 01:33:19.053
And you better take it, 'cause I can
make you work for us without it.

01:33:19.088 --> 01:33:21.813
What the hell good is Hooker to you?

01:33:21.853 --> 01:33:24.603
He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.

01:33:26.353 --> 01:33:28.983
- He'll never do it.
- I think he will.

01:33:52.173 --> 01:33:54.633
He's there. Let's get on it.

01:33:56.173 --> 01:33:58.133
What's the line on Exponent?

01:33:59.223 --> 01:34:00.893
Five to one.

01:34:02.053 --> 01:34:04.183
- How's it going?
- Nothing yet.

01:34:04.223 --> 01:34:07.353
I had a good one on the lead at
Lincoln Fields, but he faded.

01:34:07.393 --> 01:34:10.403
Best we had the last hour was
Love Potion at Rockingham...

01:34:10.443 --> 01:34:12.523
and she was 5 to 1.

01:34:12.573 --> 01:34:15.863
All the long shots coming in today.

01:34:15.903 --> 01:34:17.903
Take 4 to 1 if you have to.

01:34:17.953 --> 01:34:19.918
Okay.

01:34:19.953 --> 01:34:22.783
You can forget the boodle, Eddie.

01:34:22.833 --> 01:34:26.663
He could hit us for 15 grand
at 4 to 1. We can't handle that.

01:34:26.703 --> 01:34:28.663
- Give him the shutout.
- Okay.

01:34:28.713 --> 01:34:32.213
Okay, Billie, here we go.

01:34:32.253 --> 01:34:35.423
At the wire, it's Wrecking
Crew, the winner by five.

01:34:35.463 --> 01:34:39.053
Black Mischief,
second; Whichaway, third.

01:34:39.093 --> 01:34:43.143
Wrecking Crew was...
3 to 1. That's our boy.

01:34:46.723 --> 01:34:48.683
Henry?

01:34:52.153 --> 01:34:55.113
Here we go, Henry. We got a 3
to 1 at Belmont... Wrecking Crew.

01:34:58.613 --> 01:35:00.613
Yeah?

01:35:04.533 --> 01:35:07.163
All right. Okay.

01:35:20.633 --> 01:35:23.683
- Yeah?
- In the sixth race at Belmont.

01:35:23.723 --> 01:35:26.513
Wrecking Crew to win; Black
Mischief to place;

01:35:26.563 --> 01:35:28.523
Whichaway to show.

01:35:38.943 --> 01:35:40.903
Wait here.

01:35:45.033 --> 01:35:47.543
The winner, Time To Go,
paid seven dollars...

01:35:47.578 --> 01:35:50.083
5.40 and 3.80.

01:35:50.123 --> 01:35:53.623
Joy Flag, $6 and 4.20.

01:35:53.673 --> 01:35:56.633
Readily paid 3.80 to show.

01:35:56.673 --> 01:35:57.848
The weather's threatening,

01:35:57.883 --> 01:36:00.513
but the track is fast there
in Salem, New Hampshire.

01:36:03.433 --> 01:36:06.513
Here's a late jockey change there
in the fifth at Rockingham.

01:36:06.553 --> 01:36:09.433
R. C. Stark will ride Itsie-Bitsie.

01:36:09.473 --> 01:36:11.433
- Thank you, sir.
- That's R. C. Stark.

01:36:11.483 --> 01:36:13.943
Five thousand on Black
Mischief, across the board.

01:36:13.983 --> 01:36:15.943
Sixth at Belmont.

01:36:17.363 --> 01:36:20.533
Would you hurry up there, please?

01:36:20.573 --> 01:36:24.363
Wrecking Crew is 3 to
1; Vale Of Tears, four;

01:36:24.398 --> 01:36:27.163
Black Mischief,
five; Whichaway, six;

01:36:27.203 --> 01:36:31.083
Chief Yeoman, 12;
Peerless Pal is 20;

01:36:31.118 --> 01:36:33.873
and Mariato is, uh, 40.

01:36:33.913 --> 01:36:36.293
And here we go for
the sixth at Belmont.

01:36:36.333 --> 01:36:38.633
It's five and a half
furlongs. They're at the post.

01:36:38.673 --> 01:36:40.633
- Now.
- The flag is up.

01:36:40.673 --> 01:36:42.633
- And they're off!
- Sixth race, Belmont, 15,000.

01:36:42.673 --> 01:36:45.133
Excuse me, sir. We can't take any
bets once the race is started.

01:36:45.183 --> 01:36:48.358
You can bet on another
race if you care to.

01:36:48.393 --> 01:36:50.813
Going into the backstretch,
it's Wrecking Crew by two.

01:36:50.853 --> 01:36:55.063
Whichaway a half, Black Mischief and
Vale Of Tears driving on the outside.

01:36:55.103 --> 01:36:57.863
- Nothin', thank you.
- What happened?

01:36:57.903 --> 01:37:00.273
I didn't get the bet down in time.

01:37:00.308 --> 01:37:02.283
Jesus!

01:37:04.493 --> 01:37:07.913
Heading for home, it's Wrecking
Crew all alone by six lengths...

01:37:07.948 --> 01:37:10.048
Whichaway a
length, and Vale of Tears.

01:37:10.083 --> 01:37:12.418
It's Wrecking Crew, Whichaway
and Black Mischief.

01:37:12.453 --> 01:37:16.293
And at the wire, Wrecking
Crew wins it by six lengths.

01:37:16.333 --> 01:37:18.083
Black Mischief is
second by a head...

01:37:18.133 --> 01:37:20.423
Whichaway is third, followed
by Vale Of Tears.

01:37:22.383 --> 01:37:25.473
You should've had your
money on Wrecking Crew.

01:37:25.513 --> 01:37:27.973
It's raining and the track
is sloppy at Riverside Park.

01:37:28.008 --> 01:37:30.013
There's a late scratch there.

01:37:30.053 --> 01:37:33.563
Transmutate is scratched
in the fifth at Riverside.

01:37:33.603 --> 01:37:36.103
At Belmont, the
winner, Wrecking Crew...

01:37:36.138 --> 01:37:39.483
paid $6, 4.20 and 2.80.

01:37:39.523 --> 01:37:42.483
Black Mischief, 4.60 and 3.20.

01:37:46.783 --> 01:37:49.873
I'll have half a million here
by post time tomorrow.

01:37:49.913 --> 01:37:52.543
Lay it on the first race where
the odds are 4 to 1 or better.

01:37:52.583 --> 01:37:54.453
- Make sure I get to
the window on time.

01:37:54.488 --> 01:37:55.623
How am I gonna do that?

01:37:55.663 --> 01:37:58.213
I don't know. Figure it
out for yourself, Kelly.

01:38:25.993 --> 01:38:27.783
Finished?

01:38:27.823 --> 01:38:29.243
Yeah.

01:38:29.283 --> 01:38:31.573
Meat loaf, apple
pie and a cup of coffee.

01:38:37.833 --> 01:38:41.503
- Say, what time you get off work
here? - 2:00 a. m.

01:38:41.538 --> 01:38:45.173
- Yeah? Doing anything tonight?
- Yeah. Sleepin'.

01:38:45.213 --> 01:38:47.213
Eighty-five.

01:39:05.023 --> 01:39:08.783
- You got a back door to this place?
- What's wrong with the front?

01:39:08.823 --> 01:39:11.613
There's a guy out there I don't
need to see. Don't look around.

01:39:11.663 --> 01:39:14.703
- What does he want?
- He'd like to kill me.

01:39:14.743 --> 01:39:18.623
Do me a favor. Go into the bathroom,
open the window and wait there.

01:39:18.663 --> 01:39:21.503
Do what I tell you, and
everything will be jake.

01:39:21.543 --> 01:39:23.503
Please.

01:39:30.093 --> 01:39:32.093
Thanks. Good night.

01:40:05.503 --> 01:40:07.463
It's taken.

01:40:25.353 --> 01:40:27.943
Thanks. See ya.

01:40:31.783 --> 01:40:33.243
Shit.

01:41:16.323 --> 01:41:19.333
Salino. Hey,
I wasn't...

01:41:43.183 --> 01:41:46.318
Hey! Gotcha, Hooker!

01:41:46.353 --> 01:41:48.853
Hey there, Snyder. Long time no see.

01:41:48.888 --> 01:41:50.863
Get goin'!

01:42:17.513 --> 01:42:19.473
Chuck...

01:42:19.513 --> 01:42:22.563
get this off to the
department right away.

01:42:22.598 --> 01:42:24.563
Yes, sir.

01:42:40.363 --> 01:42:44.123
Hello, Hooker. Take them off.

01:42:44.163 --> 01:42:46.543
Special Agent Polk, F. B. I.

01:42:46.583 --> 01:42:48.543
Have a chair.

01:42:51.753 --> 01:42:54.133
- You want a drink or something?
- No.

01:42:55.633 --> 01:42:59.303
We want to talk to
you about Henry Gondorff.

01:42:59.343 --> 01:43:01.683
Yeah? I don't think I know him.

01:43:01.723 --> 01:43:05.163
Give yourself a couple of seconds.
You wouldn't want to lie to me.

01:43:05.198 --> 01:43:08.603
Lt. Snyder here says you've done a
lot of confidence work in his town.

01:43:08.638 --> 01:43:10.643
Oh, yeah? Lt. Snyder
doesn't know shit.

01:43:12.353 --> 01:43:15.443
- You ain't got nothin' on me.
- Yeah?

01:43:15.483 --> 01:43:17.493
How about counterfeiting?

01:43:21.453 --> 01:43:23.823
We've got a tip that
Gondorff is gonna

01:43:23.858 --> 01:43:25.873
run a con on the South Side here.

01:43:25.913 --> 01:43:29.213
All you've gotta do is tell us
when he's gonna play his chump.

01:43:29.253 --> 01:43:32.173
We come in at the
sting, make the pinch, and...

01:43:32.208 --> 01:43:35.383
you walk out free as a bird.

01:43:35.423 --> 01:43:37.883
No.

01:43:37.923 --> 01:43:41.553
You wanna spend the next 20
years in a federal penitentiary...

01:43:41.593 --> 01:43:43.053
starting tonight?

01:43:43.093 --> 01:43:44.553
I'll make parole.

01:43:45.683 --> 01:43:48.473
Like hell. You won't
even get a review.

01:43:48.523 --> 01:43:50.523
I'll chance it.

01:43:53.313 --> 01:43:57.273
Okay. If that's the way you want it.

01:43:57.323 --> 01:43:58.748
We might even provide you with a

01:43:58.783 --> 01:44:00.743
little company on
your way up the river.

01:44:00.783 --> 01:44:03.283
That wife of Luther
Coleman's... what was her name?

01:44:03.323 --> 01:44:05.958
- Alva.
- Alva.

01:44:05.993 --> 01:44:08.833
That's it. Alva Coleman.

01:44:08.873 --> 01:44:11.468
Pretty fair grifter in her time.

01:44:11.503 --> 01:44:14.133
Snyder's given us quite
a folder on her.

01:44:14.173 --> 01:44:17.808
Nothing major by itself, but...

01:44:17.843 --> 01:44:21.223
put 'em all together, it
could add up to a lot of years.

01:44:22.633 --> 01:44:26.763
- You stink, mister.
- Don't be a sap.

01:44:26.803 --> 01:44:28.933
It's not her I want.

01:44:28.973 --> 01:44:31.773
If you're too
dumb to save yourself...

01:44:31.813 --> 01:44:34.273
there's no sense dragging
her down with ya.

01:44:56.383 --> 01:44:58.383
It's over, Hooker.

01:45:00.053 --> 01:45:03.013
You can save me a lot of trouble.

01:45:03.053 --> 01:45:07.513
But I'm gonna get Henry Gondorff
whether you help me out or not.

01:45:21.983 --> 01:45:25.033
- You'll wait till the chump
is played? - Hell, yes.

01:45:25.073 --> 01:45:27.533
We don't care about the
mark. He deserves what he gets.

01:45:27.573 --> 01:45:28.788
I mean completely played.

01:45:28.823 --> 01:45:31.543
You come in before we beat
him, and I'll kill him.

01:45:32.623 --> 01:45:34.753
All right, Hooker.

01:45:34.793 --> 01:45:38.503
But you try to take it on the lam,
and we'll shoot you down on sight.

01:45:46.633 --> 01:45:49.263
As long as I get to finish the play.

01:45:59.273 --> 01:46:01.943
What is it, kid? You're
not saying much.

01:46:01.983 --> 01:46:05.243
- Just got the jumps.
- Come in.

01:46:05.283 --> 01:46:09.073
Things are a little slow. I wanna
open the round for the girls.

01:46:09.123 --> 01:46:11.083
Sure.

01:46:14.793 --> 01:46:17.083
Take it easy, kid. We're
not gonna lose him now.

01:46:17.123 --> 01:46:20.423
We had him ten years ago when
he decided to be somebody.

01:46:20.463 --> 01:46:23.673
Believe me, I've
seen enough to know. Ten.

01:46:23.713 --> 01:46:25.673
- Twenty.
- Thirty.

01:46:25.723 --> 01:46:28.183
- Go. -
Thirty-one.

01:46:34.473 --> 01:46:37.563
How many guys you
conned in your life, Henry?

01:46:37.603 --> 01:46:40.443
I don't know. Two, three hundred.

01:46:40.483 --> 01:46:44.903
Sometimes we played two a
day when I was with O'Shea's mob.

01:46:44.943 --> 01:46:47.703
Of course, Chicago
was a rigged town.

01:46:47.743 --> 01:46:52.323
The fix was in. The dicks took
their end without a beef.

01:46:52.373 --> 01:46:55.623
We had it down to a business.

01:46:55.658 --> 01:46:58.873
And it really stunk, kid.

01:46:58.913 --> 01:47:03.293
No sense in bein' a grifter if it's
the same thing as bein' a citizen.

01:47:03.343 --> 01:47:07.303
I got packin' to do. I'm gonna be
a hot number again after tomorrow.

01:47:18.523 --> 01:47:22.523
I wouldn't ask you to do this,
you know, if it weren't for Luther.

01:47:22.563 --> 01:47:26.693
Nothin's gonna make up for
Luther. Revenge is for suckers.

01:47:26.728 --> 01:47:29.403
I've been griftin' 30
years. I never got any.

01:47:31.863 --> 01:47:33.823
Then why're you doin' it?

01:47:35.243 --> 01:47:38.163
It seems worthwhile, doesn't it?

01:47:43.713 --> 01:47:45.713
See ya.

01:50:06.193 --> 01:50:08.103
Looks like he missed you.

01:50:08.153 --> 01:50:12.073
Yeah, yeah. This time, anyway.

01:50:12.108 --> 01:50:14.193
Good night, Mrs. Hillard.

01:50:21.243 --> 01:50:24.793
I was wonderin' if you might
want to come out for a while...

01:50:24.833 --> 01:50:26.793
maybe have a drink or something.

01:50:26.833 --> 01:50:30.383
You move right along, don't you?

01:50:30.423 --> 01:50:33.003
Hey, I don't mean nothin' by it.

01:50:33.053 --> 01:50:36.053
I just don't know
many regular girls, is all.

01:50:36.093 --> 01:50:38.513
And you expect me to
come out just like that?

01:50:38.553 --> 01:50:42.143
If I expected somethin', I wouldn't
still be standin' here in the hall.

01:50:42.183 --> 01:50:45.068
I don't even know you.

01:50:45.103 --> 01:50:49.523
You know me. I'm just like you.

01:50:49.563 --> 01:50:52.983
It's 2:00 in the
morning, and I don't know nobody.

01:51:18.883 --> 01:51:22.223
Come on, Henry. Knock off.

01:51:22.263 --> 01:51:24.473
You've done everything you can.

01:55:55.873 --> 01:55:59.003
- Yeah? Polk.
- Polk, this is Hooker.

01:55:59.043 --> 01:56:01.673
- Ready?
- Yeah, go ahead.

01:56:01.713 --> 01:56:03.883
Everything's all set. There'll
be a guy or two at the door.

01:56:03.923 --> 01:56:06.173
Nobody's carrying any heaters, so
you shouldn't have any trouble.

01:56:06.213 --> 01:56:08.173
Okay. See you there.

01:57:10.943 --> 01:57:14.913
She was gonna kill you,
kid. Her name's Loretta Salino.

01:57:14.953 --> 01:57:18.583
Lonnegan's people set her
up in the diner. Come on.

01:57:18.623 --> 01:57:21.123
Let's get out of here.

01:57:21.163 --> 01:57:23.163
Come on!

01:57:27.793 --> 01:57:29.803
Come on!

01:57:35.013 --> 01:57:37.763
She could have killed me last night.

01:57:37.803 --> 01:57:40.433
Too many people could
have seen you go in her room.

01:57:40.473 --> 01:57:45.193
She was a real professional. Used
to work in the Dutch Schultz mob.

01:57:45.233 --> 01:57:47.863
Who are you?

01:57:47.903 --> 01:57:50.363
Gondorff asked me to look after you.

01:58:00.413 --> 01:58:03.873
Snyder, we just got a
tip that Gondorff's mark...

01:58:03.913 --> 01:58:06.043
is some big New York wheel.

01:58:06.083 --> 01:58:08.753
As soon as we're inside, you
get him out of there fast...

01:58:08.793 --> 01:58:10.753
before the reporters show up.

01:58:10.803 --> 01:58:13.593
I don't want any big shots
around to mess this up for me.

01:58:13.633 --> 01:58:15.593
All right, let's go!

01:59:16.403 --> 01:59:19.208
Let's go, guys!

01:59:19.243 --> 01:59:21.243
The flag is up, kid.

01:59:27.713 --> 01:59:30.583
- Anytime, J. J.
- I'm workin' on it.

01:59:41.593 --> 01:59:43.973
We got one, Billie. Here we go.

01:59:58.073 --> 02:00:00.863
- Yeah?
- Place it on Lucky Dan...

02:00:00.913 --> 02:00:03.373
third race at Riverside Park.

02:00:23.093 --> 02:00:25.723
1:11 and 3/5ths seconds.

02:00:25.763 --> 02:00:28.813
They were off at 21.

02:00:28.853 --> 02:00:33.103
Last call on the
third at Riverside Park.

02:00:33.153 --> 02:00:35.113
They're at the post.

02:00:35.153 --> 02:00:37.903
At Havre De Grace, the
winner, Light Chatter...

02:00:37.943 --> 02:00:41.153
paid 5.40, 3.80...

02:00:41.203 --> 02:00:43.493
and 2.40.

02:00:43.533 --> 02:00:47.743
- Blacksod... -
$500,000 to win.

02:00:47.793 --> 02:00:50.333
Lucky Dan, third race at Riverside.

02:00:52.373 --> 02:00:54.673
- Post time for the third race...
- You heard me.

02:00:54.713 --> 02:00:57.843
- is 2:27.
- Hold on, sir.

02:00:57.883 --> 02:00:59.883
- There's a jockey change...
- I'll get the manager.

02:00:59.918 --> 02:01:01.848
in the fourth at Belmont.

02:01:01.883 --> 02:01:06.183
Jay Stout will ride Flying Cross.

02:01:06.223 --> 02:01:11.273
See that guy over there? He just bet
a half million dollars on Lucky Dan.

02:01:11.313 --> 02:01:14.023
The winner at Rockingham Park...

02:01:14.063 --> 02:01:17.063
Enfin, paid 6.10...

02:01:17.098 --> 02:01:19.863
4.30 and 2.50.

02:01:23.953 --> 02:01:25.913
What's your problem?

02:01:25.953 --> 02:01:28.533
I'm putting half a million
dollars on Lucky Dan to win...

02:01:28.583 --> 02:01:30.333
third race at Riverside.

02:01:30.373 --> 02:01:34.293
Can't lay that off in time. A
bet like that could break us.

02:01:36.293 --> 02:01:39.383
Not only are you a cheat...

02:01:39.423 --> 02:01:41.513
you're a gutless cheat as well.

02:01:46.223 --> 02:01:49.353
- What are the odds?
- Four to one.

02:01:52.433 --> 02:01:54.443
Take all of it.

02:02:05.323 --> 02:02:07.363
Ladies and
gentlemen, this is Arnold Rowe...

02:02:07.413 --> 02:02:09.783
calling the third race at Riverside.

02:02:09.833 --> 02:02:13.253
This is a claiming race for
$1,500 for three-year-olds and up.

02:02:13.288 --> 02:02:16.395
It's been raining, and
the track is muddy.

02:02:16.430 --> 02:02:19.503
The flag is up, and
they're off and running.

02:02:19.543 --> 02:02:21.753
Dr. Twink is going to the front...

02:02:21.803 --> 02:02:24.883
followed by Lucky
Dan, Ima Dreamer, Orkin...

02:02:24.923 --> 02:02:28.143
Josie G., Chi Chi and Little Star.

02:02:28.183 --> 02:02:31.143
Around the clubhouse
turn, it's Lucky Dan ahead...

02:02:31.183 --> 02:02:33.563
Dr. Twink a length, Orkin a half...

02:02:33.603 --> 02:02:37.943
followed by Ima Dreamer, Josie
G., Chi Chi and Little Star.

02:02:37.983 --> 02:02:39.948
Into the backstretch...

02:02:39.983 --> 02:02:42.613
it's Lucky Dan a
length, Dr. Twink a half...

02:02:42.653 --> 02:02:45.248
Orkin a head, Ima Dreamer by one.

02:02:45.283 --> 02:02:47.953
Sorry, I couldn't wait. Everything
going all right?

02:02:47.993 --> 02:02:50.993
You got nothing to worry about.

02:02:51.033 --> 02:02:55.123
- Dr. Twink a length, Orkin a half.
- I put it all on Lucky Dan.

02:02:55.158 --> 02:02:57.758
Half a million dollars to win.

02:02:57.793 --> 02:03:00.843
- Into the turn Lucky Dan still a
length. - To win?

02:03:00.878 --> 02:03:04.673
I said place! Place
it on Lucky...

02:03:04.713 --> 02:03:07.138
That horse is gonna run second!

02:03:07.173 --> 02:03:10.263
Ima Dreamer a half, Dr.
Twink a half and Orkin by two,

02:03:10.298 --> 02:03:11.990
followed by Little Star.

02:03:12.025 --> 02:03:13.683
It's a driving finish!

02:03:13.723 --> 02:03:16.393
There's been a
mistake. Give me my money back!

02:03:16.433 --> 02:03:19.193
I tell you there's been a mistake!
Give me my goddamn money back!

02:03:20.653 --> 02:03:23.193
All right, everybody.
F. B. I.! Don't anybody try to leave.

02:03:23.233 --> 02:03:24.198
Stand on your feet,

02:03:24.233 --> 02:03:27.243
put your hands over your
head and move nice and slow.

02:03:27.283 --> 02:03:30.458
Snyder!

02:03:30.493 --> 02:03:34.583
Get 'em up against the wall. Make
sure they're not carrying anything.

02:03:37.333 --> 02:03:40.253
Hello, Henry. It's been a long time.

02:03:40.293 --> 02:03:42.713
But it's over.

02:03:42.753 --> 02:03:45.003
Okay, kid, you can go.

02:03:47.173 --> 02:03:50.223
All right, I said
hands up. Keep 'em up!

02:03:50.263 --> 02:03:53.853
Come on. Move 'em back! Put 'em up!

02:04:13.203 --> 02:04:16.123
Get him out. Get him out!

02:04:17.163 --> 02:04:20.123
Come on! Gotta get you out of here!

02:04:30.053 --> 02:04:32.518
- Come on!
- But my money's in there!

02:04:32.553 --> 02:04:35.433
There's a couple of dead guys
too. You can't get mixed up in that.

02:04:35.468 --> 02:04:38.313
You don't understand. There's a
half a million dollars in there!

02:04:48.193 --> 02:04:50.153
He's gone.

02:04:56.913 --> 02:04:58.993
Okay, Henry, all clear.

02:05:17.893 --> 02:05:20.603
Can you believe
it? We pulled it off.

02:05:20.643 --> 02:05:21.818
It's a nice con, Hickey.

02:05:21.853 --> 02:05:24.653
I thought you were the feds
myself when you came in.

02:05:24.693 --> 02:05:28.023
No trouble, Henry. Snyder
went for it all the way.

02:05:28.073 --> 02:05:31.823
You should've seen the
rag he lit under Lonnegan!

02:05:36.743 --> 02:05:39.203
Well, kid, you beat him.

02:05:40.453 --> 02:05:43.293
You're right,
Henry. It's not enough.

02:05:45.923 --> 02:05:47.883
But it's close.

02:05:51.133 --> 02:05:54.223
Okay, guys, let's take
this place apart fast.

02:05:54.263 --> 02:05:57.603
You can pick up your splits
from Eddie at Boudreau's tonight.

02:06:02.273 --> 02:06:04.233
Nice goin', J. J.

02:06:25.623 --> 02:06:28.083
You're not gonna stick around
for your share?

02:06:29.133 --> 02:06:31.593
Nah. I'd only blow it.

02:07:14.263 --> 02:07:16.883
One, two.
One, two, three.
