Previously on "Switched at Birth"...

00:01.413 --> 00:02.981
- Excuse me, hey!
- I'm sorry.

00:03.115 --> 00:05.404
- Is this your trash?
- I'm overseeing the renovation.

00:05.483 --> 00:07.651
- So yeah, I guess it is.
- Okay if I take this?

00:07.685 --> 00:09.286
Misdemeanor, attempted extortion...

00:09.320 --> 00:12.456
I never saw this coming. Not from you.

00:12.490 --> 00:13.707
John hates me.

00:13.741 --> 00:16.560
You guys had a really
good relationship before.

00:16.594 --> 00:19.629
You need to find a way to remind him.

00:19.664 --> 00:21.565
I don't want to play with you scrubs.

00:21.599 --> 00:23.333
Fine. You don't want to play field hockey.

00:23.367 --> 00:24.568
How about basketball? If I win,

00:24.602 --> 00:25.752
then you've gotta join the team.

00:25.803 --> 00:27.537
I win, you drive me to
school every morning.

00:29.674 --> 00:31.541
See you at 7:00.

00:31.576 --> 00:32.642
You're here to play.

00:32.677 --> 00:34.644
If she's the best player you've got,

00:34.679 --> 00:35.745
you're going to need me.

00:35.780 --> 00:37.681
- What?
- Her tire was slashed

00:37.715 --> 00:39.483
the first day back at school.

Oh, that's not good.

02:48.579 --> 02:49.679
Hey.

02:49.697 --> 02:52.449
Oh, crap. You probably want breakfast.

02:52.483 --> 02:54.618
Since when do you make me breakfast?

02:54.652 --> 02:56.686
And what are you doing awake so early?

02:56.704 --> 02:58.421
I couldn't sleep.

02:58.456 --> 02:59.623
Even in my dreams,

02:59.657 --> 03:01.625
I keep hunting for new clients for K&D.

03:01.659 --> 03:02.726
How's it going?

03:02.760 --> 03:05.562
I need to come up with
a less shameless version

03:05.596 --> 03:07.464
of "Dear Buckner parent I don't know."

03:08.716 --> 03:11.718
And then there's this project manager guy.

03:11.752 --> 03:13.520
I met him when I was dumpster diving

03:13.554 --> 03:15.388
at this building he was renovating.

03:15.423 --> 03:16.639
Was that in a Sandra Bullock movie?

03:16.691 --> 03:19.392
Yeah, I know.

03:19.427 --> 03:22.796
Just trying to work every
angle I can think of.

03:22.830 --> 03:24.698
I'm not really sure
that I can pull this off.

03:24.732 --> 03:26.649
Is there anything I can do?

03:26.701 --> 03:28.401
Not unless you've got an extra 50 grand

03:28.436 --> 03:29.536
to remodel your bedroom?

03:31.438 --> 03:32.672
You have practice this early?

03:32.707 --> 03:34.607
No, I lost a bet.

03:34.625 --> 03:38.444
So I have to pick up
this girl in Kendall Park.

03:38.462 --> 03:39.612
Wait wait wait wait wait.

03:39.630 --> 03:42.382
Is everything else
okay? School, the clinic?

03:42.416 --> 03:44.484
All good.

03:44.518 --> 03:47.520
Maybe I should rename the business "R&D."

03:47.555 --> 03:49.823
At least our initials can be together.

04:04.405 --> 04:05.655
Hi.

04:05.689 --> 04:07.640
Our first game's tomorrow.

04:07.658 --> 04:08.775
Will you be there?

04:08.809 --> 04:10.677
Will you?

04:10.711 --> 04:12.679
Don't you have community
service at the clinic?

04:14.482 --> 04:16.783
I worked my schedule around the game.

04:16.817 --> 04:19.486
Ah.

04:19.519 --> 04:21.454
Count me in.

04:24.425 --> 04:26.342
Hey.

04:28.345 --> 04:29.796
So you ready?

04:29.830 --> 04:32.365
I'd better be. John's gonna be there.

04:32.399 --> 04:33.533
What?

04:33.567 --> 04:36.536
He's coming to our first game?

04:36.570 --> 04:39.706
I just thought we'd have
a few games under our belt

04:39.740 --> 04:42.442
before he showed up and told me everything

04:42.476 --> 04:43.676
I'm doing wrong.

04:43.694 --> 04:44.727
You're not doing anything wrong.

04:44.779 --> 04:46.613
The team's gonna be fine.

04:46.647 --> 04:48.615
Huh? If I can just get you and Sharee

04:48.649 --> 04:51.618
to work together, then
we might have a chance.

04:53.521 --> 04:55.555
I can do that.

04:56.590 --> 04:58.524
Thanks.

05:01.745 --> 05:03.329
Honey.

05:03.363 --> 05:04.664
You want some raspberry for your cereal?

05:04.698 --> 05:06.549
What? No.

05:06.584 --> 05:07.750
No, wait. Oh, I don't know.

05:09.386 --> 05:11.370
It's awfully early in the school year

05:11.388 --> 05:14.340
for you to be so stressed out.

05:14.374 --> 05:17.663
I'm trying to figure out all my
stuff for early admission into Pratt,

05:17.678 --> 05:19.679
and there's just, like a lot...

05:19.713 --> 05:21.481
Well, you know what Grandpa Bill would say.

05:21.515 --> 05:22.782
"You gotta diversify."

05:22.817 --> 05:25.318
Prove to them that you're
not the totally average person

05:25.352 --> 05:26.486
"that I know you are."

05:26.520 --> 05:28.555
You're not average, and neither is Bay.

05:28.589 --> 05:29.789
Compared to the thousands of kids

05:29.824 --> 05:31.791
applying for like 40 spots,

05:31.826 --> 05:33.459
I might be.

05:33.494 --> 05:34.761
I just hope a recommendation letter

05:34.795 --> 05:36.796
from Teresa Ledarsky will mean something.

05:36.831 --> 05:38.598
Teresa who?

05:38.632 --> 05:40.433
My art teacher.

05:40.467 --> 05:41.801
She was a very important figure

05:41.836 --> 05:43.670
in the '80s performance art scene.

05:43.704 --> 05:44.754
Performance art?

05:44.788 --> 05:46.405
Yeah.

05:46.423 --> 05:47.540
You may not be that
impressed with her work,

05:47.575 --> 05:48.741
but Pratt will be.

05:48.776 --> 05:50.376
I just hope that she's impressed with me.

05:51.645 --> 05:53.780
Okay. Go get 'em, tiger.

05:53.814 --> 05:55.348
See you at practice.

05:59.520 --> 06:02.272
Oh, honey, I have some leftover tuna salad

06:02.306 --> 06:03.556
for lunch if you want it.

06:03.590 --> 06:04.724
Ah, that's okay.

06:04.758 --> 06:06.593
I actually wanted to talk
to you about something.

06:06.627 --> 06:08.428
I hope you don't freak out

06:08.462 --> 06:10.396
or burst into tears.

06:10.431 --> 06:12.398
What?

06:12.433 --> 06:14.701
I'm thinking about getting my own place.

06:16.370 --> 06:18.371
I talked to dad already,
and he's cool with it.

06:18.405 --> 06:20.373
You talked to dad?

06:20.407 --> 06:21.708
Well, I didn't want to leave you out.

06:21.742 --> 06:23.543
I just told him I wanted to talk about it

06:23.577 --> 06:25.712
with you myself.

06:25.746 --> 06:29.449
Well, I'm excited for you.

06:29.483 --> 06:31.351
You are?

06:31.385 --> 06:34.387
Of course. It's your first place.

06:34.421 --> 06:35.555
Have you found anything yet?

06:35.589 --> 06:37.457
Do you need help?

06:37.491 --> 06:39.459
Well, there was this one place

06:39.493 --> 06:40.793
that we looked at before the wedding,

06:40.828 --> 06:42.428
but it's gone.

06:42.463 --> 06:44.631
I'm checking out a few later on today.

06:44.665 --> 06:46.532
You know what, Renzo has a friend

06:46.567 --> 06:47.700
that's a rental agent.

06:47.735 --> 06:49.636
I'll call him and see if he can help out.

06:49.670 --> 06:51.638
Great.

06:51.672 --> 06:54.473
Thanks!

07:17.431 --> 07:18.681
Morning! Sorry I'm late.

07:18.716 --> 07:20.333
White girl on this side of town...

07:20.367 --> 07:22.735
thought maybe you got carjacked.

07:26.506 --> 07:28.674
I drove through Norm's.

07:28.692 --> 07:30.677
Got your breakfast burrito.

07:30.711 --> 07:32.528
Thanks.

07:32.563 --> 07:35.348
So Toby and I were talking
about field hockey this morning,

07:35.366 --> 07:37.750
and let's face it...

07:37.785 --> 07:40.320
you and I are going to
be carrying this team.

07:40.354 --> 07:42.522
So if you ever wanted to
go over the playbook and...

07:42.556 --> 07:44.590
Why aren't we moving?

07:44.625 --> 07:46.392
The whole deaf thing.

07:46.427 --> 07:48.561
I can't really talk and
drive at the same time.

07:48.595 --> 07:51.764
Unless you're up for a
really scary ride to school.

07:51.799 --> 07:55.435
Wasn't planning on talking.

07:55.469 --> 07:56.753
Okay.

08:02.726 --> 08:04.543
In and out of the cones. In and out.

08:04.561 --> 08:05.711
Stay low, stay low.

08:05.729 --> 08:07.430
Nice job, nice job.

08:07.481 --> 08:10.316
Eyes up! Eyes up! Eyes up.

08:10.351 --> 08:11.601
All right, Bay. Here we go.

08:11.652 --> 08:13.486
Side to side. Side to side.

08:13.520 --> 08:14.570
Right hand a little lower.

08:14.605 --> 08:16.606
- Oh, okay.
- You got it.

08:18.609 --> 08:20.610
Good job, Bay. Keep it up.

08:23.664 --> 08:25.564
Hey! Watch it.

08:28.452 --> 08:30.670
That's it. Good job.

08:38.578 --> 08:40.578
So how's it going with Sharee?

08:40.597 --> 08:43.599
I tried to talk with her about some plays,

08:43.634 --> 08:46.419
but she totally shut me down.

08:53.560 --> 08:56.312
I'd say stick with the not-talking thing.

08:56.363 --> 08:57.613
Yeah.

08:57.648 --> 09:00.616
Nice shot.

09:00.651 --> 09:02.435
So where'd you learn that?

09:02.453 --> 09:04.603
It's called YouTube.

09:04.621 --> 09:06.572
Okay...

09:06.606 --> 09:09.325
Let's see what you two can
do with some give and gos.

09:09.376 --> 09:10.609
- Sure.
- Let's keep going, guys.

09:10.627 --> 09:12.378
Here we go, here we go, here we go.

09:12.413 --> 09:15.381
Hey, Bay. Come on.

09:35.602 --> 09:39.472
See? This is why you have me on the bench.

09:41.492 --> 09:44.310
Yeah! You two are like
Lebron and Wade out there.

09:44.328 --> 09:46.696
Yeah, I'm Lebron. She's Wade.

09:51.685 --> 09:53.653
Yes, it's a toilet.

09:53.687 --> 09:55.671
But it's also a question.

09:55.706 --> 09:57.623
Duchamp is playing with the whole idea

09:57.658 --> 09:59.392
of art as a commodity.

09:59.426 --> 10:02.495
As something that you can buy
to show status and privilege.

10:02.529 --> 10:03.763
It's also hilarious.

10:03.797 --> 10:05.531
Exactly.

10:05.566 --> 10:08.568
That's why we're still talking
about it 100 years later.

10:10.404 --> 10:12.405
Okay, we'll pick this up on Thursday.

10:12.439 --> 10:13.606
Remember, no class tomorrow,

10:13.640 --> 10:15.641
and get those paper proposals in.

10:21.698 --> 10:23.349
Well, great.

10:23.367 --> 10:24.617
Now I'm just supposed
to tell the difference

10:24.651 --> 10:27.403
between smart dumbass and just dumbass.

10:27.454 --> 10:28.538
Why are you still carrying that thing?

10:28.572 --> 10:29.622
I thought you pledged already.

10:29.656 --> 10:31.657
Yeah, I got caught without the brick again.

10:31.691 --> 10:32.825
Kind of getting used to it, though.

10:32.859 --> 10:34.693
You heading out?

10:34.711 --> 10:36.546
Uh, hang on.

10:36.580 --> 10:38.714
Okay.

10:38.749 --> 10:40.533
Professor Ledarsky.

10:40.551 --> 10:42.418
Teresa.

10:42.469 --> 10:43.753
I was wondering if you would be willing

10:43.804 --> 10:45.605
to help me out with my
application to Pratt.

10:45.639 --> 10:47.740
I really need a letter of recommendation.

10:47.774 --> 10:49.392
And I know we just got started,

10:49.426 --> 10:50.576
but it would be so amazing

10:50.611 --> 10:51.711
if you would consider writing me one.

10:51.745 --> 10:54.597
Um, I really don't have much to go on.

10:54.648 --> 10:56.582
I know, which is why

10:56.617 --> 10:59.519
maybe I could help you out at your studio.

10:59.553 --> 11:01.454
You could look at some of my work.

11:01.488 --> 11:03.556
Well, actually,

11:03.590 --> 11:05.691
I'm in a show in Minneapolis tomorrow.

11:05.725 --> 11:08.594
If you wouldn't mind
helping loading a 200-pound

11:08.629 --> 11:11.364
bronze sculpture into an old station wagon,

11:11.398 --> 11:13.332
driving six hours,

11:13.367 --> 11:15.468
eating some cheese, looking at some art,

11:15.502 --> 11:16.736
I wouldn't mind the help.

11:16.770 --> 11:18.671
That sounds perfect.

11:18.705 --> 11:23.509
We may need some help
with the loading part.

11:25.462 --> 11:26.596
Tank.

11:26.630 --> 11:29.682
How would you like to road-trip
with me to Minneapolis,

11:29.716 --> 11:32.585
earn major brownie points from Teresa,

11:32.619 --> 11:34.453
look at some funky art, and
eat really bad road food?

11:34.488 --> 11:35.788
Uh, dude...

11:35.822 --> 11:37.723
you had me at "road trip."

____

13:12.936 --> 13:14.437
I can't get over how
incredible that place was.

13:14.471 --> 13:16.472
It's like living in New York.

13:16.490 --> 13:17.657
Mom, you've never lived in New York.

13:17.691 --> 13:20.476
That little corner store...
you could just run over there

13:20.494 --> 13:21.644
if you need some milk.

13:21.662 --> 13:23.446
It's a super-convenient convenience store.

13:23.480 --> 13:25.882
Well, actually, I could just bring some by.

13:25.916 --> 13:28.834
It's that close.

13:28.869 --> 13:30.703
You could even do your laundry here.

13:30.754 --> 13:32.889
Oh, and I know that your dad

13:32.923 --> 13:35.875
is gonna love that grill in the backyard.

13:35.926 --> 13:37.660
I just...

13:37.694 --> 13:38.895
I don't know if I can afford it.

13:38.929 --> 13:40.863
I read somewhere that
rent's not supposed to be

13:40.898 --> 13:42.765
more than 1/3 of your monthly income.

13:42.799 --> 13:45.551
Oh! We could help you.

13:45.602 --> 13:47.637
- Really?
- Yeah, we were going to have to pay

13:47.671 --> 13:49.805
for your housing in college anyway, so...

13:49.839 --> 13:51.908
I guess.

13:51.942 --> 13:53.693
Hey!

13:53.727 --> 13:55.645
So great news.

13:55.679 --> 13:57.897
Remember that letter of recommendation

13:57.948 --> 13:59.732
I needed from my art teacher?

13:59.783 --> 14:01.884
She is having an art show
tomorrow in Minneapolis

14:01.919 --> 14:04.453
and she invited me to help her out.

14:04.488 --> 14:05.755
It would be a great opportunity

14:05.789 --> 14:07.690
for me to be exposed to the art world

14:07.724 --> 14:10.693
with a real artist, and all I
need from you is permission to go.

14:10.792 --> 14:12.593
Well, okay. I guess.

14:12.628 --> 14:15.596
Actually, you also need
permission from your coach.

14:15.631 --> 14:17.865
Because you have a game tomorrow.

14:17.899 --> 14:19.667
Everyone else has a game.

14:19.701 --> 14:21.502
I have a date with a bench.

14:21.536 --> 14:23.704
You have an obligation to your team.

14:23.814 --> 14:25.748
Why don't you just play the game

14:25.782 --> 14:27.616
- and then go?
- The show's in the afternoon.

14:27.651 --> 14:29.752
I'd miss the whole thing.

14:29.786 --> 14:30.953
I need my players on the field.

14:30.987 --> 14:33.572
You have a choice to make.

14:33.623 --> 14:36.692
Between art and field hockey...

14:36.727 --> 14:38.661
what do you think I'm going to pick?

14:38.695 --> 14:40.746
Fine. You're off the team.

14:43.633 --> 14:45.601
Am I supposed to be upset?

14:46.703 --> 14:49.054
Then I ran a wire through the faucet

14:49.089 --> 14:51.006
and put a switch on the spigot,

14:51.040 --> 14:52.057
and there you go.

14:52.092 --> 14:54.643
The fruits of your dumpster.

14:54.678 --> 14:56.679
Interesting.

14:56.713 --> 14:58.564
I have to admit... I didn't come here

14:58.598 --> 14:59.715
just to show you a lamp.

14:59.733 --> 15:01.650
When I'm not digging through dumpsters,

15:01.685 --> 15:03.786
I also run K&D design.

15:03.820 --> 15:05.571
We're a small firm, but we've done a lot

15:05.605 --> 15:06.822
of different work spaces.

15:06.857 --> 15:09.692
I definitely think we can
help you with this one.

15:09.726 --> 15:11.894
Yeah, I could use some
help with my furniture.

15:11.928 --> 15:13.863
Maybe you just need the right designer.

15:13.897 --> 15:17.867
I took the liberty of
bringing our look-book.

15:17.901 --> 15:21.704
This was a raw space when we started.

15:21.738 --> 15:22.922
We kept the openness.

15:22.956 --> 15:24.907
And this was a print shop

15:24.925 --> 15:26.041
that just needed a quick makeover.

15:26.075 --> 15:29.011
Yeah. I like your lamp.

15:29.045 --> 15:31.931
The whole idea of
repurposing discarded stuff.

15:31.965 --> 15:33.883
- That's good.
- Yeah.

15:33.917 --> 15:36.635
- Are you free tomorrow?
- I... I can be.

15:36.686 --> 15:38.587
- Hey, Jess!
- Yeah.

15:38.622 --> 15:40.055
Can we get another one on
the flight to Denver tomorrow?

15:40.089 --> 15:41.657
We're flying?

15:41.691 --> 15:42.825
Is that a problem?

15:42.859 --> 15:44.593
Oh! No, I just...

15:44.628 --> 15:46.061
so last minute, I didn't
want to put you out.

15:46.096 --> 15:47.730
Oh, you're not putting anyone out.

15:47.764 --> 15:48.898
It's my jet.

15:48.932 --> 15:50.866
You don't have a desk,

15:50.901 --> 15:51.967
but you have a jet.

15:52.002 --> 15:53.736
Yeah.

15:53.770 --> 15:55.788
Huh. Okay.

15:55.822 --> 15:58.741
Hey, did you see the
Jayhawks play Iowa last night?

15:58.775 --> 16:00.659
Mm-hmm. What's the sign for Jayhawks?

16:00.710 --> 16:02.578
- Jayhawks.
- Jayhawks.

16:02.612 --> 16:03.946
Man, that's cool. I needed to know that one

16:03.964 --> 16:05.748
'cause this year we're going all the way.

16:05.782 --> 16:06.882
Mm-hmm.

16:06.917 --> 16:08.634
What are you doing after school?

16:08.668 --> 16:09.785
Gotta get to my job. Why?

16:09.803 --> 16:11.003
Just wondering if you wanted

16:11.054 --> 16:12.721
to squeeze in one more practice.

16:12.756 --> 16:14.623
Why are you so worried about this game?

16:14.641 --> 16:15.724
It's not like it's the playoffs.

16:15.759 --> 16:17.626
Not that we'll ever get that far.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.929
Uh, my dad's gonna be there.

16:19.963 --> 16:21.764
And I just kind of wanted us to do good.

16:21.798 --> 16:23.732
Mm, just keep getting the ball to me,

16:23.767 --> 16:24.850
and we'll be fine.

16:30.941 --> 16:31.991
What's your name?

16:32.025 --> 16:34.910
Sharee Gifford, why?

16:34.945 --> 16:36.679
Stand over there.

16:36.713 --> 16:38.030
What'd we do?

16:38.081 --> 16:40.783
Use the wrong water fountain?

16:40.817 --> 16:42.952
- Locker search.
- You can't do that.

16:42.986 --> 16:45.020
Yeah, we can. It's school property.

16:57.339 --> 16:58.613

17:34.804 --> 17:36.005
Oh, hey!

17:36.039 --> 17:38.607
Someone put Hoffman's
first scrimmage online.

17:38.642 --> 17:40.876
We should totally put Sharee
on their left defender.

17:40.911 --> 17:43.012
I just got off the phone
with principal rose.

17:43.046 --> 17:46.882
Sharee is not going to be
playing in the game tomorrow.

17:46.917 --> 17:47.917
Why not?

17:49.819 --> 17:52.571
They found a knife in her locker.

17:53.857 --> 17:56.625
So she got expelled.

18:11.067 --> 18:12.201
What are you doing here?

18:12.235 --> 18:15.020
Toby told me you got expelled from school.

18:15.038 --> 18:16.956
Yeah. On the bright side,

18:16.990 --> 18:18.157
you don't have to pick me up anymore.

18:18.191 --> 18:19.892
How can you make a joke about this?

18:19.926 --> 18:21.093
What am I supposed to do?

18:21.127 --> 18:23.229
The principal said I'm lucky
she didn't call the cops.

18:23.263 --> 18:26.131
- Why did you have a knife?
- It was a box cutter.

18:26.166 --> 18:27.833
A what?

18:27.867 --> 18:29.034
I told you I work after school.

18:29.069 --> 18:32.238
I cut open boxes at a grocery store.

18:32.272 --> 18:34.073
I must have left it in my bag.

18:34.107 --> 18:36.308
Why didn't the metal detectors catch it?

18:36.343 --> 18:37.910
I don't know.

18:37.944 --> 18:39.878
Well, did you tell
Principal Rose all of this?

18:39.896 --> 18:41.247
She didn't believe me.
All she wanted to know

18:41.281 --> 18:42.881
is why do I hate deaf kids?

18:42.916 --> 18:44.049
I told her she's crazy.

18:44.117 --> 18:45.884
I didn't slash those tires.

18:45.919 --> 18:47.086
I didn't break any windows.

18:50.890 --> 18:53.192
Wait, those windows were
smashed before school.

18:53.226 --> 18:54.927
Yeah, so?

18:54.961 --> 18:56.161
I picked you up.

18:56.196 --> 18:58.998
We went to practice and then
Ms. Troyer's class together.

18:59.032 --> 19:01.800
It couldn't have been
you. We're fighting this.

19:01.835 --> 19:03.118
I'm not going back to that racist school.

19:03.169 --> 19:06.171
Stop! Carlton is a good school.

19:06.206 --> 19:07.873
They just made a mistake.

19:07.907 --> 19:09.124
Come in with me tomorrow,

19:09.175 --> 19:11.010
and we'll talk to Principal Rose together.

19:26.026 --> 19:28.994
She can't show up, but she's
happy to take her commission.

19:29.064 --> 19:30.097
Is that your dealer?

19:30.131 --> 19:31.148
My agent.

19:31.182 --> 19:33.300
Hey, this trip will involve pizza

19:33.318 --> 19:34.902
at some point, right?

19:34.936 --> 19:36.854
Yeah, you guys call the food stops.

19:36.905 --> 19:40.040
I'm choosing the music, 'cause
the crap you kids listen to...

19:40.075 --> 19:42.109
I know. I can't stand most of it either.

19:42.143 --> 19:43.310
I mean, what's up with that?

19:43.328 --> 19:44.978
I can't even hear a band.

19:44.996 --> 19:47.081
It sounds like everything
has been done on a laptop.

19:47.115 --> 19:48.248
Well, I like some old-school stuff.

19:48.283 --> 19:50.150
A little Bob Marley.

19:50.168 --> 19:51.919
Of course you do.

19:51.953 --> 19:53.320
You heard of Patti Smith?

19:53.338 --> 19:55.122
Yeah.

19:55.156 --> 19:56.340
A little.

19:58.176 --> 20:00.878
I saw her at CBGB's.

20:00.929 --> 20:03.163
Changed my life.

20:03.181 --> 20:05.215
This chick out of Jersey.

20:05.266 --> 20:07.334
She didn't give a damn what anybody thinks

20:07.352 --> 20:10.354
of the way she dresses
or the way she sounds.

20:10.388 --> 20:12.072
You know what...

20:12.107 --> 20:14.174
you're at your best when
you don't give a crap.

20:14.209 --> 20:16.944
Here, put this on.

20:30.962 --> 20:32.096
Sorry I'm late.

20:32.130 --> 20:33.263
You've got copies of your pay stubs, right?

20:33.298 --> 20:34.998
Yeah, mom...

20:35.016 --> 20:36.183
We've gotta get going.

20:36.217 --> 20:38.102
I told the leasing office
we'd be there by 2:00.

20:38.136 --> 20:41.004
Yeah, I already called to cancel.

20:41.039 --> 20:42.222
Why? We can still make it.

20:42.273 --> 20:45.142
I found another place.

20:45.176 --> 20:47.044
It's in Edgewater.

20:47.078 --> 20:49.246
It's a one-bedroom. It's
got a washer and dryer.

20:49.280 --> 20:51.148
Edgewater is 30 minutes away,

20:51.182 --> 20:52.950
and it's not a very
good neighborhood, honey.

20:52.984 --> 20:54.118
It's
up-and-coming,

20:54.152 --> 20:56.286
and I can afford it on my own.

20:56.321 --> 20:58.188
I told you that we would help you.

20:58.223 --> 21:00.224
I signed the lease papers this morning.

21:01.960 --> 21:03.093
Oh.

21:03.128 --> 21:05.996
I think you're really going to like it.

21:06.030 --> 21:07.881
You know? It's charming.

21:07.916 --> 21:10.134
The molding, it's original.

21:10.168 --> 21:11.969
You got married without us.

21:12.003 --> 21:13.237
You found a new place without us.

21:13.271 --> 21:15.172
I got married without you

21:15.206 --> 21:17.274
because you weren't
supportive of my relationship.

21:17.308 --> 21:19.343
You keep making all these big decisions

21:19.377 --> 21:20.878
without talking to us first.

21:20.912 --> 21:22.246
Mom, I'm married and I still live

21:22.280 --> 21:24.281
at home with my parents.

21:24.315 --> 21:26.950
Nikki and I are going to
need a place of our own

21:26.985 --> 21:28.886
and I want to be able to pay for it.

21:28.920 --> 21:30.921
I'm just trying to man up here.

21:30.955 --> 21:33.941
I'm going to talk to your dad about this.

21:41.199 --> 21:44.168
Wow, this place is amazing.

21:44.202 --> 21:46.370
Yeah, Minneapolis. Who knew?

21:46.404 --> 21:48.238
You must be Teresa. I'm Eve.

21:48.256 --> 21:50.040
- We emailed.
- Yes, hi.

21:50.074 --> 21:51.341
It's such an honor to have you here.

21:51.376 --> 21:54.044
I don't think I mentionned, but
I wrote part of my thesis on you.

21:54.078 --> 21:55.979
And I'm not even dead yet.

21:56.014 --> 21:57.848
Those are my assistants.

21:57.882 --> 21:58.849
Bay and Tank.

21:58.883 --> 21:59.933
Hey.

21:59.968 --> 22:01.118
This place is so cool.

22:01.152 --> 22:02.920
Thanks.

22:02.954 --> 22:04.888
She's the artist. I'm just the muscle.

22:04.923 --> 22:06.857
Speaking of which,

22:06.891 --> 22:08.926
where should we put this bad boy?

22:17.101 --> 22:18.318
Oh...

22:18.369 --> 22:21.071
Uh, unfortunately we're
keeping the floor open

22:21.105 --> 22:23.106
for some performances.

22:23.141 --> 22:24.875
Was this in the images you submitted?

22:24.909 --> 22:26.877
I brought new work.

22:26.911 --> 22:30.047
Okay, well, there is this wall here.

22:31.916 --> 22:33.250
Oh, got it. Okay.

22:33.284 --> 22:36.303
I'll make some selections.

22:36.337 --> 22:38.989
Well, let me know if you
need any help hanging.

22:39.023 --> 22:40.257
We're so excited.

22:40.291 --> 22:41.892
It's really nice to meet you.

22:41.926 --> 22:43.026
You too.

22:44.262 --> 22:45.896
I have a feeling we're going to be

22:45.930 --> 22:48.015
subjected to a DJ at some point.

22:50.018 --> 22:51.902
Well, this stuff is so great.

22:51.936 --> 22:53.187
Well, hang the new pieces

22:53.238 --> 22:55.989
and I'll take the old stuff away.

23:01.029 --> 23:03.914
Okay, this thing is going
to give me nightmares.

23:03.948 --> 23:06.200
It looks a little gargoyle-ish.

23:06.251 --> 23:09.152
It looks like something my
stoner cousin made at Ren Faire.

23:09.170 --> 23:10.337
You can't be into this.

23:10.339 --> 23:13.023
You know what, I am not
here to be an art critic.

23:13.057 --> 23:14.925
I am here to get you a
letter of recommendation.

23:14.959 --> 23:15.926
Roger that.

23:18.263 --> 23:19.863
I'm still trying to convince them

23:19.898 --> 23:21.164
to do a cafe off the main lobby here.

23:21.199 --> 23:24.134
I can't believe the city
was going to tear this down.

23:24.168 --> 23:25.852
People never know what they have.

23:25.887 --> 23:28.338
I saw that old movie
theater you did in Austin.

23:28.356 --> 23:30.891
This is even more beautiful.

23:30.942 --> 23:32.059
So you finally looked me up, huh?

23:32.110 --> 23:33.894
Believe me, it's a good thing

23:33.945 --> 23:36.313
that I didn't know who you were
before I showed you that lamp.

23:36.347 --> 23:39.199
Hey... why don't you work with me on this?

23:39.234 --> 23:40.918
Me?

23:40.952 --> 23:43.120
Well, your firm. Do the interiors.

23:43.154 --> 23:45.022
I'm not... I mean,

23:45.056 --> 23:47.291
yes, I would love to.

23:47.325 --> 23:49.960
But I've never done restoration.

23:49.994 --> 23:51.161
No no no. I want to start new in there.

23:51.195 --> 23:53.046
Do something like your lamp.

23:53.081 --> 23:55.916
Use salvaged parts, but completely turn

23:55.967 --> 23:57.033
the whole thing on its head.

23:57.051 --> 23:59.303
Something fun and playful.

23:59.337 --> 24:02.256
- Smart.
- That would be incredible.

24:02.307 --> 24:03.974
- Yes!
- Great.

24:04.008 --> 24:06.143
How soon can you be here?

24:06.177 --> 24:08.228
We wouldn't work from K.C.?

24:08.263 --> 24:11.214
I would need you on site, but
it wouldn't be for very long.

24:11.249 --> 24:13.016
Four months, six tops.

24:13.051 --> 24:15.018
Oh.

24:15.052 --> 24:16.920
This is really hard to say,

24:16.955 --> 24:20.157
but both my daughters are in
their senior year of high school,

24:20.191 --> 24:22.092
and I really need to be home.

24:22.126 --> 24:24.227
You're kidding me, right?

24:24.262 --> 24:26.113
Well, they're getting
ready to go off to college.

24:26.164 --> 24:27.264
It's a really big year.

24:27.298 --> 24:29.116
What, they need you to pack their lunch?

24:29.167 --> 24:31.935
- They're 17.
- Can I come on the weekends?

24:31.970 --> 24:33.270
When the crew's not here.

24:33.304 --> 24:35.138
Or we could wait till June.

24:35.173 --> 24:36.906
You want me to stall my
project for nine months...

24:36.924 --> 24:38.875
just send everyone home for a year.

24:38.910 --> 24:42.245
Then I guess I have to say no.

24:42.263 --> 24:44.931
And I'm really sorry. And thank you.

24:44.966 --> 24:46.967
You know what, this is unbelievable.

24:47.018 --> 24:48.251
You have an opportunity

24:48.269 --> 24:50.354
to completely change the scale
of your dinky little firm.

24:50.388 --> 24:53.290
What is it? You like doing
two-bit kitchen makeovers?

24:53.324 --> 24:55.892
Or Laura Ashley funeral parlors?

24:55.926 --> 24:58.094
You know what, forget it. Offer rescinded.

25:02.181 --> 25:03.214
Sounds nice.

25:03.232 --> 25:04.432
Says there's plenty of street parking.

25:04.483 --> 25:05.566
It's close to Carlton.

25:05.781 --> 25:07.365
I drove by and the house next door

25:07.399 --> 25:08.732
looks like something out of a horror movie.

25:09.650 --> 25:12.185
If there's traffic, it's going to take him

25:12.236 --> 25:13.653
45 minutes to get back here.

25:13.688 --> 25:15.439
So you're okay with him moving out

25:15.473 --> 25:17.240
as long as it's in throwing distance?

25:17.275 --> 25:18.608
I just don't think he should be moving

25:18.642 --> 25:21.278
all the way across town to a
neighborhood that is not safe.

25:21.312 --> 25:23.663
He is a married man, and
I for one am quite proud

25:23.698 --> 25:25.515
that he wants to pay his own rent.

25:25.550 --> 25:26.649
Oh, so I'm an enabler.

25:26.667 --> 25:28.251
I didn't say that.

25:28.286 --> 25:30.587
I really think you should
back me up on this, John.

25:30.621 --> 25:33.423
Kathryn.

25:33.458 --> 25:35.625
The last time you went to visit your mom,

25:35.660 --> 25:38.361
you paid $250

25:38.396 --> 25:40.464
so you could leave 10 hours early

25:40.498 --> 25:42.566
because she is still telling you

25:42.600 --> 25:44.234
how to live your life.

25:46.704 --> 25:48.672
Don't be that mom.

25:58.349 --> 26:00.367
You were with her the entire morning.

26:00.401 --> 26:01.485
I swear.

26:01.519 --> 26:03.386
And you can call her manager.

26:03.421 --> 26:05.522
The box cutter is for her job.

26:05.556 --> 26:08.658
All right. I'll reverse the expulsion.

26:08.692 --> 26:10.327
Yes!

26:10.361 --> 26:12.579
But you still have Saturday
detention for a month.

26:12.630 --> 26:13.663
- What?
- Why?

26:13.697 --> 26:17.250
We have a strict no-weapon policy.

26:17.301 --> 26:18.368
You know that.

26:18.402 --> 26:19.669
But whatever the reason,

26:19.704 --> 26:21.571
you can't have a knife in your possession.

26:21.606 --> 26:23.473
- End of story.
- All right.

26:23.508 --> 26:25.675
What about field hockey?

26:25.710 --> 26:28.345
She can still play field hockey.

26:29.564 --> 26:32.449
So you're punishing me for having a job?

26:32.483 --> 26:34.568
No, I'm punishing you
for breaking the rules.

26:34.602 --> 26:37.687
- Is is some bull...
- Don't you even think about finishing that sentence.

26:37.722 --> 26:39.556
If it were her, you would have
kissed her ass for making a mistake.

26:39.590 --> 26:40.690
But with me,

26:40.725 --> 26:42.492
you want to punish me anyway?

26:42.527 --> 26:43.593
And for what?

26:43.628 --> 26:46.496
For looking how I look?

26:46.531 --> 26:48.465
Is this how you run this school?

26:48.499 --> 26:50.267
Don't you go there with me, Sharee.

26:50.301 --> 26:51.668
I am doing my job,

26:51.702 --> 26:55.338
and I treat all my students the same.

27:01.679 --> 27:04.181
Sharee, that's a win.

27:04.215 --> 27:05.298
You still get to play field hockey.

27:05.349 --> 27:07.250
You are so dumb. You know that?

27:07.268 --> 27:08.552
I went to bat for you.

27:08.586 --> 27:10.270
I'm the one who got you out of this.

27:10.304 --> 27:11.638
Oh, please! You don't give a damn about me.

27:11.689 --> 27:13.607
The only reason why you did any of that

27:13.641 --> 27:16.259
was so I could help you win the
game and make your daddy happy.

27:16.277 --> 27:18.361
- That is not true.
- The game, the game.

27:18.396 --> 27:20.447
- The game.
- Hey!

27:20.481 --> 27:22.365
- Hey!
- Yo, get off of me.

27:22.400 --> 27:24.484
What are you doing? I'm
just trying to talk to you.

27:24.535 --> 27:26.436
Don't you touch me, all right?

27:26.454 --> 27:27.621
- Get off of me!
- Break it up!

27:27.655 --> 27:29.272
Break it up.

27:35.379 --> 27:38.298
You know, I don't think I ever realized

27:38.332 --> 27:40.500
the connection between
your work in the '80s

27:40.551 --> 27:42.252
and your work now.

27:42.286 --> 27:43.486
How the body is this organic thing

27:43.521 --> 27:45.689
and yet we've moved
into this digital space.

27:45.723 --> 27:49.259
Are you aware you say every
statement like a question?

27:49.293 --> 27:50.694
I do?

27:50.728 --> 27:53.296
I do.

27:53.314 --> 27:55.465
Hey. Hey, you see these
face prints over there?

27:55.483 --> 27:57.634
They totally remind me
of these potato prints

27:57.702 --> 27:59.402
I used to do in kindergarten,

27:59.437 --> 28:01.204
except these cost like five grand each.

28:01.239 --> 28:04.307
What do all these little red dots mean?

28:08.246 --> 28:10.313
It means the piece has been sold.

28:10.348 --> 28:13.283
Oh. Oh, wow. She doesn't have any.

28:13.317 --> 28:16.586
Oh, I just stepped on a rake, didn't I?

28:21.208 --> 28:22.359
Yeah.

28:27.498 --> 28:29.466
Hey!

28:29.500 --> 28:32.435
You still want that
letter of recommendation?

28:34.372 --> 28:36.273
Whatever.

28:36.307 --> 28:37.474
They're right.

28:37.508 --> 28:39.509
My new work sucks.

28:39.543 --> 28:42.479
I don't even know what I'm doing anymore.

28:42.568 --> 28:44.336
One minute they're holding you up

28:44.370 --> 28:46.271
like you're some sort of a goddess.

28:46.305 --> 28:49.441
The next, they don't even know
how to spell your name right.

28:51.477 --> 28:53.378
I like your stuff.

28:53.412 --> 28:56.581
You like it 'cause you want something.

28:56.616 --> 29:00.218
I remember what that looks like.

29:00.253 --> 29:02.187
You want to be happy?

29:02.221 --> 29:04.556
Don't go to art school.

29:13.626 --> 29:15.327
Hey, guys.

29:15.345 --> 29:16.595
Congratulations.

29:16.629 --> 29:19.698
Our first official game became
our first official forfeit.

29:19.732 --> 29:21.800
We're setting records already.

29:21.835 --> 29:23.502
Why did you cancel the game?

29:23.520 --> 29:24.703
Oh, let's see.

29:24.737 --> 29:26.638
Well, first, Bay quit.

29:26.673 --> 29:28.740
Then my two star players
decided they'd rather

29:28.775 --> 29:30.609
beat each other up than the opposing team.

29:30.643 --> 29:31.710
That's not what happened.

29:31.744 --> 29:33.779
Yeah, she didn't even get a punch in.

29:33.813 --> 29:36.348
Thanks, guys.

29:36.382 --> 29:37.716
So proud to be your coach.

29:56.402 --> 29:58.737
I'm sorry I got you
involved in all of this.

29:58.771 --> 30:02.374
No, I'm sorry I screwed up
your letter of recommendation.

30:05.378 --> 30:07.613
I don't think that really matters anymore.

30:15.655 --> 30:17.356
Hey.

30:17.390 --> 30:19.358
Hey.

30:19.392 --> 30:22.411
I'm sorry that your game got canceled.

30:22.445 --> 30:24.446
Forfeited, actually.

30:25.615 --> 30:27.499
Pretty sure this isn't going to help,

30:27.534 --> 30:28.800
but I bought you something today.

30:28.835 --> 30:30.419
For your new place.

30:31.788 --> 30:34.506
What's that?

30:34.541 --> 30:35.680
Door-stopper?

30:35.713 --> 30:37.598
They're pot holders. Oh, my God!

30:37.632 --> 30:39.333
You're never going to survive on your own.

30:39.367 --> 30:42.436
I'm kidding. I know what it is.

30:42.470 --> 30:43.804
Just promise me you're not
going to be the kind of guy

30:43.838 --> 30:45.806
who uses his socks to get
things out of the oven.

30:45.840 --> 30:47.474
You'll burn yourself,

30:47.509 --> 30:48.575
and it's gross.

30:48.610 --> 30:51.678
Okay as long as you show
me how to work an oven.

30:53.348 --> 30:55.549
Gotcha. I'm still joking.

30:57.352 --> 30:59.319
You know...

31:00.788 --> 31:03.724
you can always come home if you need to.

31:05.627 --> 31:07.628
And I hope you'll want to.

31:09.364 --> 31:11.498
Of course.

31:11.533 --> 31:13.534
Where else am I going
to get butterscotch bars?

31:32.770 --> 31:34.555
Hey.

31:34.589 --> 31:35.756
What brings you here?

31:35.790 --> 31:39.426
Why didn't you become an artist?

31:39.460 --> 31:42.329
I wasn't aware I didn't.

31:42.363 --> 31:45.532
You know what I mean. A professional one.

31:45.567 --> 31:48.452
Maybe I didn't want it enough.

31:48.486 --> 31:50.404
Maybe I didn't think I was good enough.

31:50.438 --> 31:52.406
Maybe it just looked too hard.

31:52.440 --> 31:55.509
And sad.

31:55.543 --> 31:57.411
Is it sad?

31:57.445 --> 32:01.515
I'm starting to wonder if I
really want to go to art school.

32:01.549 --> 32:03.617
Going to school is one thing.

32:03.651 --> 32:06.353
Being an artist is another.

32:06.387 --> 32:10.457
I think it's a whole series of choices.

32:10.491 --> 32:13.460
You know? It doesn't come
down to just one opportunity

32:13.494 --> 32:16.730
or one person's opinion.

32:16.764 --> 32:18.365
At least I hope it doesn't.

32:20.635 --> 32:22.603
How was your day?

32:22.637 --> 32:24.504
Oh... you know.

32:24.539 --> 32:26.306
The usual.

32:26.341 --> 32:28.742
Flew to Denver and back on a private jet.

32:28.776 --> 32:31.511
Lost my only client
somewhere along the way.

32:31.546 --> 32:33.447
The first half sounds fun.

32:33.481 --> 32:34.648
It wasn't.

32:34.682 --> 32:36.383
The guy was a total jerk.

32:36.417 --> 32:39.353
But it hasn't stopped
me from kicking myself

32:39.387 --> 32:41.521
all night for letting it go.

32:41.556 --> 32:43.357
Well, you don't want to
work for some jerk anyway.

32:43.391 --> 32:44.558
I don't.

32:44.592 --> 32:47.494
But I do need to work for somebody.

32:49.397 --> 32:50.797
You know what I've decided...

32:50.832 --> 32:53.433
I'm not letting unhappy people

32:53.468 --> 32:54.601
decide what I get to do.

32:54.636 --> 32:57.437
That sounds like a good policy.

33:13.738 --> 33:15.455
Is Toby here?

33:15.490 --> 33:17.624
He's probably in his room.

33:17.659 --> 33:19.293
Ahem.

33:19.327 --> 33:22.396
I guess you've heard we had to forfeit.

33:22.430 --> 33:25.465
Uh, yeah. I made it as
far as the parking lot

33:25.500 --> 33:28.435
and then I saw the Hoffman
team getting on the bus,

33:28.469 --> 33:30.604
and...

33:30.638 --> 33:32.389
I'm so sorry.

33:32.423 --> 33:33.707
They seemed quite happy

33:33.741 --> 33:35.509
that they didn't have to go ten rounds

33:35.543 --> 33:38.345
with the Carlton bruisers.

33:38.379 --> 33:40.714
Okay, look...

33:42.767 --> 33:45.385
I know what you're going to say.

33:45.420 --> 33:46.620
That the school's too rough.

33:46.654 --> 33:48.655
And that you want to take me out of it.

33:48.690 --> 33:50.390
But I can explain...

33:54.629 --> 33:58.265
I'm actually starting
to think that that school

33:58.299 --> 34:00.300
is perfect for you.

34:00.335 --> 34:02.536
You get to fight.

34:02.570 --> 34:04.538
You get to blackmail senators.

34:04.572 --> 34:07.274
How long before you start robbing banks?

34:08.643 --> 34:09.743
You know what...

34:09.777 --> 34:12.512
I'm really sorry about what
happened over the summer.

34:12.547 --> 34:16.516
But I've done everything
I can to make up for it.

34:16.551 --> 34:18.284
And the only reason I got in a fight

34:18.319 --> 34:19.418
in the first place

34:19.454 --> 34:21.655
was because I was totally obsessed

34:21.688 --> 34:23.556
with trying to make this team work.

34:23.591 --> 34:25.592
And I probably lost a friend over it.

34:25.626 --> 34:26.592
And why?

34:26.627 --> 34:28.594
So that you would go to a game,

34:28.629 --> 34:30.630
and for the first time in a month,

34:30.665 --> 34:33.734
look at me like I wasn't
a total disappointment.

34:33.768 --> 34:37.670
Yeah, this whole dumb field
hockey experiment was for you.

34:37.705 --> 34:40.407
But you're never going to let it go.

34:40.440 --> 34:42.775
So just do whatever you want.

34:42.810 --> 34:44.710
Throw us out of the house.

34:44.746 --> 34:46.746
Pretend like you never
found out about the switch.

34:46.781 --> 34:49.449
I don't even care anymore.

Hey, I got your message.

36:22.605 --> 36:24.523
Thanks for coming in.

36:24.557 --> 36:27.326
I thought I should follow
up after that odd experience

36:27.360 --> 36:29.294
you must have had.

36:29.329 --> 36:31.663
It's fine.

36:31.698 --> 36:34.299
Stop saying it's fine when it isn't.

36:34.334 --> 36:37.402
I mean, it's like the question thing.

36:37.437 --> 36:39.705
We fought so hard so you
wouldn't have to do it,

36:39.739 --> 36:42.741
and you girls just keep doing it.

36:42.775 --> 36:45.544
I'm sorry.

36:45.578 --> 36:46.778
I'm sorry for saying sorry.

36:46.813 --> 36:51.517
Mm. Look, clearly, I'm not
in a great place right now.

36:51.551 --> 36:55.320
So just forget everything I said.

36:55.355 --> 36:57.322
Go and have fun at art school.

36:57.357 --> 37:00.659
Fall in love. Get your heart broken.

37:00.693 --> 37:03.262
Do derivative stuff.

37:03.296 --> 37:05.280
Do beautiful stuff that
you never even thought

37:05.315 --> 37:06.398
you had in you.

37:07.767 --> 37:10.285
Here's my letter.

37:10.320 --> 37:12.321
Thank you.

37:12.372 --> 37:14.406
But I don't think I'm
going to send a letter

37:14.440 --> 37:16.308
of recommendation in with my application.

37:16.342 --> 37:18.410
I'm just going to submit my work,

37:18.444 --> 37:19.545
let it speak for itself,

37:19.579 --> 37:21.547
and if they don't like it then screw 'em.

37:21.581 --> 37:23.448
Ballsy move.

37:23.483 --> 37:26.318
Well, you're at your best when
you don't give a crap, right?

37:26.352 --> 37:27.686
You know what...

37:27.720 --> 37:29.588
I love it.

37:29.622 --> 37:32.658
But save the Patti
Smith stuff for the work.

37:32.692 --> 37:34.693
Trust me on this one.

37:34.727 --> 37:36.345
Take the letter.

37:36.396 --> 37:38.297
Okay, good call.

37:48.374 --> 37:49.708
Can I help you?

37:51.411 --> 37:52.678
According to my assistant,

37:52.712 --> 37:55.547
I was a bit of a sociopath yesterday.

37:55.582 --> 37:58.417
So she bought me some flowers.

37:58.451 --> 38:02.621
Look, I'm not great with people.

38:02.655 --> 38:04.323
But I'm smart, I pay well,

38:04.357 --> 38:05.657
and I know talent when I see it.

38:05.692 --> 38:09.461
You basically told me

38:09.495 --> 38:11.296
if I wasn't ready to ditch my kids,

38:11.331 --> 38:12.631
I'd be doomed to kitchen makeovers.

38:12.665 --> 38:14.266
I didn't say ditch your kids.

38:14.300 --> 38:15.500
I got kids.

38:15.535 --> 38:18.437
Look, forget what I said.

38:18.471 --> 38:20.439
I knew you were the
perfect person for the job,

38:20.473 --> 38:22.274
and I lost my head.

38:22.308 --> 38:24.276
What do you care?

38:24.310 --> 38:26.445
All you liked was one stupid lamp.

38:27.680 --> 38:31.383
Because I hate it when
people make asinine decisions.

38:31.417 --> 38:33.452
And this is your attempt to win me back?

38:33.486 --> 38:35.353
This is me giving you a lifeline.

38:35.371 --> 38:37.623
I mean, are you so...

38:41.494 --> 38:43.362
I have some local projects.

38:43.396 --> 38:45.764
I'd like to find something
for you to work on

38:45.798 --> 38:49.534
so you can tuck your giant
teenagers in at night.

38:49.569 --> 38:51.470
This whole thing of insulting people

38:51.504 --> 38:53.505
to motivate them... that
does not work for me.

38:53.539 --> 38:55.407
I'm passionate.

38:55.441 --> 38:57.509
I can't promise I'm not
going to yell at you.

38:57.543 --> 38:59.611
I can't promise I'm not going to yell back.

38:59.646 --> 39:02.280
Works for me.

39:04.584 --> 39:07.269
Okay.

39:10.523 --> 39:12.607
Thanks.

39:51.430 --> 39:52.597
Hi.

39:52.615 --> 39:53.699
Oh, hey.

39:57.637 --> 39:59.504
Thanks.

40:00.773 --> 40:03.542
I...

40:06.546 --> 40:08.714
I'm way too hard on you.

40:08.748 --> 40:10.549
It's okay.

40:10.583 --> 40:12.517
No, it's not okay.

40:12.552 --> 40:14.319
You see...

40:14.353 --> 40:16.354
Sometimes I feel like

40:16.389 --> 40:18.423
I have to cram

40:18.458 --> 40:22.728
16 years of parenting

40:22.762 --> 40:26.531
into the few years that
you're actually around.

40:26.566 --> 40:28.366
And the truth is,

40:28.401 --> 40:31.703
you were just fine before I came along.

40:34.807 --> 40:37.809
I never thought that I'd
have to say this to you,

40:37.827 --> 40:41.379
but this... all this...

40:41.414 --> 40:44.349
is your home.

40:44.383 --> 40:46.485
And it always will be.

40:46.519 --> 40:49.721
Even if I rob a few banks?

40:49.756 --> 40:53.291
Even if.

41:05.337 --> 41:06.638
What the hell is this?

41:07.707 --> 41:09.441
I mean, come on!

41:09.475 --> 41:12.444
- Round, flat...
- It's hard.

41:12.478 --> 41:14.446
This makes no sense to me whatsoever.

41:14.480 --> 41:15.514
They don't make it easy.

41:15.548 --> 41:17.415
No. No, here here. Here, show me.

41:17.450 --> 41:18.583
Show me, show me.

41:18.618 --> 41:20.452
Whoo!

41:20.486 --> 41:21.753
- You choke up on it.
- Yeah.
