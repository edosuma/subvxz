00:03.670 --> 00:05.980
<i>You are being watched.</i>

00:06.139 --> 00:08.312
<i>The government has a secret system,</i>

00:08.475 --> 00:12.753
<i>a machine that spies on you,
every hour of every day.</i>
<b><font color="#0A7C32">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:12.913 --> 00:15.086
<i>I designed the Machine
to detect acts of terror,</i>

00:15.249 --> 00:16.819
<i>but it sees everything...</i>

00:16.984 --> 00:20.261
<i>Violent crimes
involving ordinary people.</i>

00:20.420 --> 00:23.367
<i>The government considers
these people irrelevant.</i>

00:23.524 --> 00:25.435
<i>We don't.</i>

00:25.592 --> 00:29.267
<i>Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.</i>

00:30.163 --> 00:31.767
<i>You will never find us.</i>

00:31.932 --> 00:33.912
<i>But victim or perpetrator,</i>

00:34.067 --> 00:37.207
<i>if your number's up, we'll find you.</i>

00:40.707 --> 00:43.415
<i>The leaked black budget report
reveals several classified</i>

<i>military intelligence programs,</i>

00:45.746 --> 00:48.955

00:49.116 --> 00:51.392
<i>A program designated
Northern Lights has...</i>

00:51.552 --> 00:55.364
<i>Northern Lights has a budget
far outstripping any other program.</i>

00:55.522 --> 00:57.468
<i>Classified as "operation support</i>

00:57.624 --> 00:59.467

00:59.626 --> 01:01.230
<i>the details are scarce.</i>

01:01.395 --> 01:04.069
<i>Some have speculated
that it may be related</i>

01:04.230 --> 01:06.404
<i>to the surveillance
of American citizens.</i>

01:06.567 --> 01:09.639
<i>If so, what does that mean
for our privacy?</i>

01:09.803 --> 01:12.613
Media got a hold of the program name,

01:12.739 --> 01:14.878
which means your old boss Control
just lost it.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.748
Bitch tried to kill me.

01:16.910 --> 01:19.030
Nice to see her head
on the chopping block for change.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.582
Anyone connected to the
Machine will be burying evidence

01:21.748 --> 01:22.988
six feet down.

01:23.150 --> 01:25.824
Could put the program in jeopardy.

01:25.986 --> 01:28.557
Government can't put
the Machine back in the box.

01:28.722 --> 01:31.293
We're still getting our numbers,
so the lights are on.

01:34.494 --> 01:35.495
Let's go.

01:43.971 --> 01:47.145
Morning.
You guys have the pancakes?

01:47.307 --> 01:49.344
Try the banana chocolate chip...
amazing.

01:49.509 --> 01:50.954
What?

01:51.111 --> 01:54.354
No small talk?
All right, fine by me.

01:55.849 --> 01:57.760
You have the product?

01:59.286 --> 02:00.356
What's it look like?

02:00.520 --> 02:01.590
You got the money?

02:07.828 --> 02:09.637
One million.
We have a deal?

02:10.631 --> 02:11.632
You got it, man.

02:17.337 --> 02:19.044
That fast, huh?

02:19.139 --> 02:21.779
Couldn't even wait to get back
to the hotel to count it?

02:22.643 --> 02:25.852
See, Ray, your partner's already
picked out a house in Hawaii.

02:26.013 --> 02:27.959
So as soon as you turn your back,
he's gonna put two in your head

02:28.115 --> 02:30.555
- and keep all the money for himself.
- But guess what, Julio.

02:30.579 --> 02:32.401
Ray here put a down payment
on a yacht,

02:32.519 --> 02:34.658
told your girl
he'd show her the world.

02:34.821 --> 02:37.563
Five-hundred thousand buys a lot.
But a million?

02:37.724 --> 02:40.034
Both of you would take
out your partner for that.

02:40.193 --> 02:42.400
- Oh, you little son of a...
- Sorry, guys. Deals off.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.040
Sweet dreams, boys.

02:57.344 --> 02:59.585
Fusco can clean this up.

02:59.746 --> 03:02.306
Twenty years in lockup ought to
keep 'em from killing each other.

03:02.330 --> 03:06.427
See? Business as usual. Even if
the government's program's on ice,

03:06.586 --> 03:08.497
the Machine is still
spitting out numbers.

03:08.655 --> 03:11.261
You know Finch,
even without Northern Lights,

03:11.491 --> 03:14.563
his machine will find a way
to maintain national security.

03:15.429 --> 03:18.899
Really? Well, then who's handling
the relevant threats?

03:26.239 --> 03:28.378
- Root.
- Hey, kids.

03:28.542 --> 03:31.113
- You miss me between drug deals?
- Yeah

03:31.278 --> 03:33.417
I miss you like I miss
an intestinal parasite.

03:33.580 --> 03:35.582
I love your similes.

03:35.749 --> 03:36.750
Hop on, Shaw.

03:36.917 --> 03:38.954
We've got a relevant number
in Alaska.

03:39.186 --> 03:40.927
We're gonna steal a jet.

03:42.289 --> 03:44.291
Does sound kind of fun.

03:44.458 --> 03:46.028
Send me a postcard.

03:47.527 --> 03:49.734
Turn that frown upside down, Lurch.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.773
You're going on vacation too.

03:51.932 --> 03:54.242
Harold's about to call from DC.
He needs your help.

04:01.141 --> 04:03.712
<i>Mr. Reese,
I'm afraid our services are required</i>

04:03.877 --> 04:05.322
<i>in the nation's capital.</i>

04:05.445 --> 04:07.391
I heard.
On my way.

04:09.000 --> 04:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:17.124 --> 04:18.432
Finch?

04:21.428 --> 04:22.634
This'll work.

04:24.431 --> 04:28.777
Oh, good, you're here.
Sorry, got tied up at the library.

04:30.904 --> 04:34.511
I'm happy to see that
you've come prepared for a long haul.

04:34.641 --> 04:37.781
Dare I hope that you've packed
something other than weaponry?

04:37.944 --> 04:40.254
There's some trip wire
to booby-trap the room door.

04:40.413 --> 04:41.858
And a toothbrush.

04:42.015 --> 04:44.120
Oral hygiene is something, I suppose.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.525
You got a number here in DC.?

04:46.686 --> 04:48.597
It would seem so.

04:48.755 --> 04:51.861
My investigation
into Vigilance's activities

04:52.025 --> 04:53.698
will have to wait.

04:53.860 --> 04:56.101
Well, Root is getting
the relevant numbers now.

04:56.263 --> 04:57.333
Shaw is with her.

04:57.497 --> 05:00.103
We're entering uncharted territory,

05:00.267 --> 05:02.941
tasked with both relevant
and irrelevant numbers.

05:03.103 --> 05:04.707
Already stretched pretty thin, Finch.

05:04.871 --> 05:06.111
And at the worst possible time.

05:07.007 --> 05:10.819
Just when Decima is determined
to make Samaritan operational.

05:10.977 --> 05:13.218
Maybe the timing's not a coincidence.

05:13.380 --> 05:15.451
I fear that it may be connected.

05:17.117 --> 05:18.619
These are strange times,

05:18.785 --> 05:23.461
and the threat of Samaritan
should not be underestimated.

05:23.623 --> 05:25.625
How do you know it's not
already up and running?

05:25.792 --> 05:27.794
Because we'd be dead, Mr. Reese.

05:28.829 --> 05:32.242
The Machine is a shield.
It protects lives.

05:32.399 --> 05:35.846
I designed it with safeguards
to prevent it being abused

05:36.002 --> 05:38.073
as an agent of destruction.

05:38.238 --> 05:41.481
Samaritan is an open system, a sword.

05:41.641 --> 05:44.212
If it gains access
to the government's feeds,

05:44.511 --> 05:46.911
there will be no checks on its power.
There will be no limits

05:46.935 --> 05:49.589
to the knowledge possessed
by the person controlling it.

05:49.749 --> 05:52.730
Decima would definitely
use it to hunt down its enemies.

05:52.886 --> 05:54.593
And as confidants of the Machine,

05:54.754 --> 05:56.495
you and I would be
at the top of the list.

05:56.656 --> 05:58.761
So maybe the Machine
is trying to protect us.

05:58.925 --> 06:03.840
No, I built it to protect everyone,
one number at a time.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.572
- Oh, my.
- What?

06:10.203 --> 06:12.274
That's Roger McCourt.

06:12.439 --> 06:14.385
Our new number
is a United States congressman?

06:14.541 --> 06:15.952
From Illinois.

06:16.109 --> 06:18.180
Six terms in Congress.

06:18.345 --> 06:21.383
Current ranking minority member
of the Pivotal House Rules Committee.

06:21.548 --> 06:25.052
The rules committee controls
the flow of legislation,

06:25.218 --> 06:28.791
spurring it forward
or stopping it altogether.

06:28.955 --> 06:32.767
If he has that much power,
he'll have plenty of enemies.

06:32.926 --> 06:35.031
Given their activities
in Washington recently,

06:35.195 --> 06:38.108
Vigilance would have to be a suspect.

06:38.265 --> 06:41.712
However, McCourt's been an outspoken
opponent of government surveillance.

06:41.868 --> 06:43.404
Could Decima want him dead?

06:43.570 --> 06:44.640
Perhaps.

06:44.804 --> 06:48.251
But killing a congressman
would seem too flashy for them.

06:48.408 --> 06:51.753
Nobody likes
the government these days.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.483
Any disgruntled citizen
could be the assassin.

06:55.315 --> 06:57.317
We have to get to the Capitol.

07:13.900 --> 07:15.243
You call this music?

07:16.603 --> 07:19.675
Finch?
Are you okay?

07:19.839 --> 07:20.840
I'm fine.

07:21.007 --> 07:23.510
Can we put the screeching cat
out of its misery?

07:23.677 --> 07:25.623
It's not feline.
It's Verdi.

07:26.579 --> 07:28.183
There's a performance of <i>ll Trovatore</i>

07:28.348 --> 07:30.123
<i>at the Kennedy Center
that I'd like to catch.</i>

07:30.283 --> 07:33.594
Next time you can be the disc jockey.
We'll listen to whatever you like.

07:33.753 --> 07:36.359
Well, maybe next time
I'll just sing for you.

07:36.523 --> 07:38.332
I do a great <i>Ring</i> cycle, you know.

07:38.491 --> 07:40.664
I think I'll skip your Brunhilde.

07:41.528 --> 07:43.030
Suit yourself.

07:44.364 --> 07:46.164
<i>Looks like our congressman
is in danger</i>

07:46.188 --> 07:47.774
<i>of catching lobbyist disease.</i>

07:47.934 --> 07:49.777
It's gonna be difficult
to get ears on McCourt.

07:49.936 --> 07:52.542
His aide handles all phone activity.

07:52.706 --> 07:55.152
McCourt doesn't want the
government eavesdropping on him?

07:55.308 --> 07:56.810
Congressmen know better than anyone

07:56.977 --> 07:58.615
that their employer
could be listening.

07:58.778 --> 08:02.453
We'll have to get close to him,
narrow down the list of threats.

08:02.615 --> 08:04.822
The Capitol police detail
won't let anyone near him.

08:06.052 --> 08:08.555
Congressmen are eligible
for Secret Service protection

08:08.722 --> 08:10.463
in the event of additional risk.

08:10.623 --> 08:12.899
No one's made an attempt
on his life yet.

08:13.059 --> 08:15.369
The congressman doesn't
even know the danger he's in.

08:22.369 --> 08:23.404
Get down!

08:27.507 --> 08:29.509
He knows now.
Drive, Finch.

08:42.155 --> 08:44.931
I have to tell you, Mr. Reese,
I don't approve of this strategy.

08:45.091 --> 08:47.093
You're the one who said
you couldn't make an alias

08:47.260 --> 08:49.069
that would pass
Secret Service muster.

08:49.229 --> 08:51.629
I said I didn't have time,
I didn't know you were gonna steal

08:51.653 --> 08:54.011
the identity of an actual
Secret Service agent.

08:54.167 --> 08:56.511
<i>I'm just borrowing it.
Relax.</i>

08:56.669 --> 08:58.205
Order some room service.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.251
<i>Perhaps I will when
you tell me what you've done</i>

09:00.416 --> 09:01.656
<i>with the real Agent Abbott.</i>

09:01.818 --> 09:05.251
He's resting comfortably
in a motel room near the airport.

09:05.412 --> 09:06.516
Define "comfortably."

09:07.680 --> 09:08.681
Gotta go, Finch.

09:08.848 --> 09:10.191
The rules committee is meeting
in ten minutes.

09:10.350 --> 09:12.057
You have your Journal interview
at 11:30.

09:12.252 --> 09:14.926
Then lunch at Ocean Grill
with Cynthia Carol from Privacy First

09:15.088 --> 09:16.863
to discuss your
anti-surveillance initiative.

09:17.023 --> 09:19.128
- Good morning, Leslie.
- Good morning, Congressman.

09:19.292 --> 09:20.293
Who's this?

09:20.460 --> 09:22.980
This is Agent Abbott, Secret Service.
He's been assigned to you.

09:23.530 --> 09:25.441
Because of the shooting?
- Oh, sorry.

09:25.598 --> 09:27.798
I was thinking more about
the business ahead of me today

09:27.867 --> 09:29.141
rather than behind.

09:29.302 --> 09:31.213
<i>Where you from, Abbott?</i>

09:31.604 --> 09:33.049
He's from Tulsa, Oklahoma.

09:33.973 --> 09:35.145
Tulsa, sir.

09:35.308 --> 09:38.778
Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Good people, salt of the earth.

09:38.945 --> 09:41.152
And for tonight, tickets to the
Verdi opera at the Kennedy Center.

09:41.314 --> 09:43.817
Do I have to go to this?
This sounds like screeching cats.

09:43.983 --> 09:46.759
- You promised your wife.
- I could shoot you in the leg, sir.

09:46.920 --> 09:47.921
Pardon me?

09:48.788 --> 09:50.324
Might get you out of the opera.

09:51.758 --> 09:54.118
You know, Duran here,
he always wanted to be Secret Service.

09:54.160 --> 09:55.264
Isn't that right, Duran?

09:55.428 --> 09:56.907
At one time, sir.

09:57.063 --> 09:58.940
Well, if you show Abbott
some love here,

09:59.099 --> 10:00.942
maybe he'll put in
a good word for you.

10:01.734 --> 10:04.112
Oh, and we can dispense
with the stoplights today, okay?

10:23.790 --> 10:25.133
McCourt!

10:25.291 --> 10:29.171
Dunphy. You should've called first.
My office is slammed this morning.

10:29.329 --> 10:30.774
Is this about the airline contract?

10:30.930 --> 10:32.810
- They're trying to stick it to us, Mac.
- Yeah.

10:32.866 --> 10:35.627
Now I'm hearing you might be taking
their side instead of the union's?

10:35.768 --> 10:37.111
Dunphy, Dunphy.

10:37.270 --> 10:38.840
<i>It must be Bruce Dunphy,</i>

10:39.005 --> 10:41.781
part of the leadership
of the Illinois Machinists Union.

10:41.941 --> 10:46.048
I know it's a lousy contract,
but I do think that you ought to sign it.

10:46.212 --> 10:49.216
Unbelievable.
You backstabbing son of a...

10:49.382 --> 10:51.182
- Whoa, hold it, hold it.
- Think you can pull

10:51.284 --> 10:53.565
this bait and switch with us,
we me, and get away with it?

10:53.589 --> 10:56.297
Looks like McCourt might have
crossed the wrong union boss.

10:56.456 --> 10:59.198
It's not a good deal,
but it does keep the plant open.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.532
And it puts you
at the front of the line

11:01.694 --> 11:02.974
for a bigger government contract

11:03.129 --> 11:05.735
that's coming down
the pipe next year.

11:05.899 --> 11:07.401
- Another contract?
- Yeah.

11:08.201 --> 11:11.705
So you see, Bruce,
I am looking out for your guys.

11:11.871 --> 11:13.908
But you do have to trust me.

11:16.075 --> 11:17.884
<i>I guess I jumped
the gun a little bit.</i>

11:18.044 --> 11:19.250
Forget it.

11:19.412 --> 11:21.585
- Hey, is your wife in town with you?
- Yeah.

11:21.748 --> 11:23.921
Here.
Go as my guest.

11:24.083 --> 11:26.063
It's classical stuff.
She'll love it.

11:26.219 --> 11:28.028
Really?
Oh, thanks, Mac.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.532
It's my pleasure.
Tell your guys not to worry.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.431
Remember, I'm your man.

11:32.592 --> 11:33.593
Thanks.

11:33.760 --> 11:36.934
Leslie, call my wife and tell her
unfortunately the opera was sold out.

11:37.096 --> 11:39.098
It would appear our congressman
has quite a knack

11:39.265 --> 11:41.768
for getting himself out
of unpleasant situations.

11:41.935 --> 11:44.415
Yeah, that opera
would've been brutal.

11:44.571 --> 11:45.571
Hmm.

12:10.296 --> 12:12.242
I'm not accustomed to taking meetings

12:12.398 --> 12:15.106
on such short notice,
but your reputation precedes you.

12:15.268 --> 12:18.943
Don't worry, Senator.
I come with only the best of intentions.

12:19.706 --> 12:21.310
So what can I do for you?

12:21.474 --> 12:25.650
Actually it's what I can do for you
and your Northern Lights problem.

12:25.812 --> 12:29.988
If you're referring
to the leaked black-budget report,

12:30.149 --> 12:32.322
mine's just one of 100 names
found in there.

12:32.485 --> 12:34.965
I've already made it clear
I have no knowledge of that project.

12:34.989 --> 12:39.392
Really? I thought you knew
a great deal about it,

12:39.559 --> 12:43.598
especially since the 2008 policy retreat
on Martha's vineyard

12:43.763 --> 12:46.903
when you were tapped
to shepherd the program.

12:48.434 --> 12:52.143
Surely you didn't think, in a world
where you were surveilling everyone,

12:52.305 --> 12:53.978
that no one was watching you.

12:55.174 --> 12:58.087
So, what is it you want?

12:58.244 --> 13:00.918
As I told you, to help.

13:01.814 --> 13:05.193
The group responsible for leaking
your black budget to the press

13:05.351 --> 13:07.627
calls themselves Vigilance.

13:07.787 --> 13:08.925
Privacy terrorists.

13:09.088 --> 13:11.329
This is one of their leaders,

13:11.491 --> 13:15.303
known by his alias as Peter Collier.

13:16.696 --> 13:17.697
Ironic.

13:17.864 --> 13:19.707
You risked your career

13:19.866 --> 13:22.039
hiding a program
designed to protect the country,

13:22.201 --> 13:25.808
yet it couldn't protect you from
this group when you needed it to.

13:25.972 --> 13:29.181
And now you've had to shut it down,

13:29.342 --> 13:32.846
leaving your country unprotected.

13:33.012 --> 13:34.992
A frightening prospect indeed.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.719
The country will always be protected.

13:37.884 --> 13:40.660
Yes, I'm sure you're weighing
alternative approaches,

13:40.820 --> 13:42.800
as your president might say.

13:42.955 --> 13:45.333
I can save you the time.

13:45.491 --> 13:48.301
My company, Decima Technologies,

13:48.461 --> 13:51.670
is finalizing development
of a new surveillance system.

13:52.799 --> 13:56.906
All due respect, we've gone down
a similar path with mixed results.

13:58.071 --> 14:00.574
Northern Lights was effective
but compromised by the ethics

14:00.740 --> 14:02.583
of its creator.

14:02.742 --> 14:04.915
It spoke but never listened.

14:05.078 --> 14:08.685
What I have not only listens,
but obeys.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.089
It can find anyone,

14:11.250 --> 14:14.356
anywhere, anytime.

14:15.321 --> 14:16.994
You merely need to ask.

14:19.192 --> 14:22.571
As intriguing as that sounds,
there are some members of Congress

14:22.729 --> 14:25.039
making too much hay
out of this latest scandal

14:25.198 --> 14:27.337
to ever green-light another program.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.039
Heh.

14:29.202 --> 14:32.445
Share my proposal
with your colleagues.

14:32.605 --> 14:35.176
If there is interest,

14:35.341 --> 14:37.753
dissenting voices
will not be a problem.

14:37.910 --> 14:39.514
How can you be sure?

14:39.679 --> 14:44.219
Because, Senator,
obstacles are only obstacles

14:44.384 --> 14:46.796
until you move them out of the way.

14:53.126 --> 14:55.367
So how long you been
with the congressman?

14:55.528 --> 14:58.634
Long enough to know he doesn't
need Secret Service protection.

14:58.798 --> 15:01.642
- What about the shooting?
- Just some antigovernment wing nut

15:01.801 --> 15:04.873
- looking to make the news cycle.
- I suppose that's possible.

15:05.037 --> 15:06.710
<i>Mr. Reese?</i>

15:06.873 --> 15:10.047
That's my supervisor.
Guy's always in my ear.

15:11.711 --> 15:13.816
- What do you got, Finch?
- Nothing of note.

15:13.980 --> 15:16.824
McCourt's list of enemies
is practically nonexistent.

15:16.983 --> 15:19.930
<i>He ran a surprisingly clean
campaign to get into office,</i>

15:20.086 --> 15:22.126
and his current stand
against unchecked surveillance

15:22.288 --> 15:24.461
has endeared him
to elements of both parties.

15:24.624 --> 15:26.968
- What about his personal life?
- No red flags.

15:27.126 --> 15:29.299
<i>Finances are sound, carries no debt,</i>

15:29.462 --> 15:31.339
<i>and has an impressive
stock portfolio.</i>

15:33.099 --> 15:34.579
And that's the point
I'm making now...

15:40.306 --> 15:42.616
- Help you with something, friend?
- Let go of me.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.254
I'm trying to be polite here.

15:44.410 --> 15:46.651
It's all right, Abbott,
I've got this.

15:47.847 --> 15:50.487
- Have a seat.
- Thank you, sir.

15:52.118 --> 15:54.758
Local homeless guy.
I've seen him around.

15:54.921 --> 15:56.025
McCourt knows him?

15:56.189 --> 15:57.930
No, but people like him know McCourt.

15:58.090 --> 16:00.650
He's got a standing offer to buy
a meal for anyone who needs one.

16:00.674 --> 16:02.697
It's a practice he started last year

16:02.862 --> 16:04.808
<i>to raise awareness
for the homeless problem.</i>

16:04.964 --> 16:08.138
<i>- One more, Congressman.
- Also helps burnish his public image.</i>

16:08.301 --> 16:09.871
Okay. Get him some soup.

16:22.014 --> 16:24.051
Finch, take this down.

16:24.217 --> 16:28.131
Echo-Five-Dash-Nine-Mike-India-Six.

16:30.022 --> 16:31.057
A license plate?

16:31.224 --> 16:33.204
See if you can trace it.

16:33.359 --> 16:34.804
Abbott, chop chop!

16:35.528 --> 16:36.666
<i>What was that?</i>

16:36.829 --> 16:38.069
Forget it.

16:41.567 --> 16:44.411
Starting to think
I should've gone with Root.

16:53.479 --> 16:56.392
Thanks for being my travel buddy
on these errands.

16:58.017 --> 17:01.055
Sure, it's not every day
you get to beat up

17:01.220 --> 17:04.064
a militia group in Anchorage,
then hop a plane to Miami.

17:05.724 --> 17:09.763
So is this what you're doing from
now on, you're chasing down bad guys?

17:10.762 --> 17:12.242
I doubt it.

17:12.397 --> 17:14.708
There's still
too much work to be done.

17:16.435 --> 17:17.435
What kind of work?

17:18.570 --> 17:19.948
Preparation.

17:22.241 --> 17:24.278
I understand.
We're leaving now.

17:24.443 --> 17:27.049
- Time to go.
- Where to?

17:27.213 --> 17:29.784
- St. Louis.
- Oh, great.

17:29.949 --> 17:33.522
I know a steak joint that serves
a filet that's better than sex.

17:33.686 --> 17:36.690
Yummy <i>as</i> that sounds,
you won't be joining me.

17:36.856 --> 17:39.097
She needs you somewhere else.

17:40.359 --> 17:42.134
Where?

17:49.802 --> 17:52.373
You should go back
to dealing coke, Sonny.

17:52.538 --> 17:55.314
It's a lot safer
than moving explosives.

18:22.268 --> 18:23.269
You there, Finch?

18:23.436 --> 18:26.940
Always, Mr. Reese.
Sounds rather quiet there.

18:27.106 --> 18:30.610
I think the only thing McCourt
is in danger of is working too late.

18:30.776 --> 18:33.450
I fear you may need to remain
on his security detail

18:33.613 --> 18:34.990
longer than anticipated.

18:35.147 --> 18:37.423
Shouldn't we check in
on the real Agent Abbott?

18:38.184 --> 18:40.596
Yeah, I guess
someone should turn him over.

18:40.753 --> 18:42.096
I beg your pardon?

18:49.362 --> 18:52.309
- What's going on?
- Something's wrong, Finch.

18:54.700 --> 18:56.475
- Sorry.
- What the hell, Abbott?

18:56.636 --> 18:58.309
You never heard of knocking?

18:59.438 --> 19:02.180
I'm sorry.
I thought I heard a...

19:03.376 --> 19:05.049
Never mind.

19:05.211 --> 19:07.851
Should I call it in?

19:09.448 --> 19:11.519
Finch, McCourt and his aide
have been working

19:11.684 --> 19:13.527
on more than just policy positions.

19:13.686 --> 19:16.223
Might wanna consider
his wife as a possible threat.

19:16.389 --> 19:19.563
Actually, her e-mails show
that she's been aware

19:19.725 --> 19:21.864
of his affairs
for quite some time.

19:22.028 --> 19:25.635
Seems they have more of
an arrangement than a marriage.

19:25.798 --> 19:27.334
Mr. Reese, I found something.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.501
<i>What is it?</i>

19:28.668 --> 19:31.239
With Fusco's aid,
I was able to trace the license plate

19:31.404 --> 19:34.544
<i>from the SUV outside the restaurant
back to a rental car company.</i>

19:34.707 --> 19:37.347
It seems the vehicle
was rented to a shell corporation

19:37.510 --> 19:40.218
set up by another company.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.318
Decima Technologies.

19:42.481 --> 19:43.721
Decima.

19:44.850 --> 19:47.694
You were right, Finch.
It's all connected.

19:49.422 --> 19:51.333
McCourt must be a threat
to Samaritan.

19:54.160 --> 19:56.766
Which would explain why they're here.

20:04.837 --> 20:05.837
Duran.

20:05.838 --> 20:07.718
<i>There's something
you should know, Officer.</i>

20:07.742 --> 20:09.483
He's not Secret Service.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.451
What? Who's this?

20:12.611 --> 20:15.387
<i>Here's the real Agent Abbott.</i>

20:23.222 --> 20:24.257
Don't do it.

20:26.926 --> 20:29.133
- Abbott, what are you doing?
- Stay put.

20:36.402 --> 20:39.611
- Mr. Reese, what's happening?
- Change of plans. I've got McCourt.

20:39.772 --> 20:41.115
Got him?

20:41.373 --> 20:44.047
You've kidnapped
a United States congressman?

20:44.210 --> 20:47.987
Like you said, Finch,
these are strange times.

21:09.068 --> 21:10.342
Hello, Harold.

21:10.503 --> 21:12.063
Mr. Reese,
I have to question the wisdom

21:12.223 --> 21:13.634
of abducting an elected official.

21:13.792 --> 21:16.578
Well, Decima blew my cover
and started shooting.

21:16.742 --> 21:19.586
The Capitol police and Secret Service
are scouring the city for you now,

21:19.745 --> 21:22.419
plus the FBI and about a dozen
other three-letter agencies.

21:22.581 --> 21:24.254
Let's see how they're doing.

21:24.416 --> 21:26.487
<i>...traveling west
on Independence Avenue.</i>

21:26.652 --> 21:29.360
<i>Congressman was abducted
in a black sport utility vehicle,</i>

21:29.522 --> 21:32.366
<i>- Illinois license plate 20...</i>
- That's us.

21:32.525 --> 21:34.766
So we need to dump the car
and hole up somewhere.

21:34.927 --> 21:37.100
Very well. Turn left up here.
I know a place.

21:42.968 --> 21:44.777
<i>American Beef Consultants, Finch?</i>

21:46.038 --> 21:48.109
We need a hiding place, not a burger.

21:48.274 --> 21:50.880
Last month I bought
the beef industry's lobbying arm.

21:51.043 --> 21:53.614
And don't knock the hamburgers.
They're superb.

21:56.715 --> 21:58.661
Doesn't look like much
of a safe house.

21:58.818 --> 22:00.559
That's the idea.
I cleared out this floor,

22:00.719 --> 22:02.479
and added a couple of
cutting-edge amenities:

22:02.488 --> 22:04.729
fully stocked kitchen,
bulletproof glass.

22:04.890 --> 22:07.370
Okay, Mac, you gonna scream?

22:07.526 --> 22:08.834
Mmm.

22:08.961 --> 22:11.202
John, bedside manner.

22:11.363 --> 22:14.037
Congressman, strange as it may seem,

22:14.200 --> 22:16.146
we wish you no harm,
we're here to help.

22:16.302 --> 22:18.179
But we do need to ask you
a few questions,

22:18.337 --> 22:21.079
and we would prefer that you
did not yell for assistance.

22:27.847 --> 22:29.258
Who are you?

22:29.415 --> 22:31.895
Security advisors... of a sort.

22:32.051 --> 22:33.894
Well, yeah, I can pay the ransom.

22:34.053 --> 22:36.363
I can get however
much money you need.

22:36.522 --> 22:39.059
- Someone's trying to kill you.
- Yeah, you.

22:39.225 --> 22:42.069
- What? No. We're protection.
Protection?

22:42.228 --> 22:45.175
You posed as, uh, Secret Service,

22:45.331 --> 22:48.938
you knock out my security detail,
and then you abduct me at gunpoint.

22:49.101 --> 22:51.206
Technically I also shot
at you a couple days ago.

22:52.271 --> 22:54.012
Somebody help me, please!

22:54.173 --> 22:55.743
That's enough!

22:57.009 --> 22:58.613
We don't have time for this.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.351
If you wanna survive,
you have to help us.

23:00.412 --> 23:03.222
Now, about that hit squad that
my colleague rescued you from.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.089
Hit squad?
That wasn't a hit squad.

23:05.251 --> 23:07.390
That was the FBI
trying to save me from you.

23:07.553 --> 23:09.897
I know it may have appeared
that way, but I assure you

23:10.055 --> 23:11.591
that was not the case.

23:11.757 --> 23:13.597
What do you know
about a company called Decima?

23:14.460 --> 23:15.632
Never heard of it. Why?

23:15.794 --> 23:17.434
They sent the team
that tried to kill you.

23:17.591 --> 23:19.511
Do you know why they would
consider you an enemy?

23:19.535 --> 23:21.141
Me, an enemy?

23:21.300 --> 23:23.803
I'm not an enemy.
People love me.

23:23.969 --> 23:26.381
I mean, I might piss
a few people off along the way,

23:26.538 --> 23:29.041
but I always get 'em
whatever it is they need.

23:29.208 --> 23:31.154
I'm a deal maker.

23:31.310 --> 23:33.483
So what is it with you guys?
What do you want, money?

23:33.646 --> 23:35.785
You want a personal telephone
call from the president?

23:35.948 --> 23:37.256
'Cause I can get it.

23:37.416 --> 23:40.295
Just please, come on.

23:40.452 --> 23:42.125
Let me go.

23:42.288 --> 23:46.100
Then, whatever you need,
I'm your man.

23:48.627 --> 23:49.662
Finch, get down!

24:16.355 --> 24:18.460
- You guys all right?
- Yes, we're fine.

24:18.624 --> 24:20.535
Why is everybody
shooting at everybody?

24:20.693 --> 24:22.297
If you're shooting
at federal agents...

24:22.461 --> 24:24.964
Feds don't walk in scattering lead.

24:25.130 --> 24:26.939
- Decima found us.
- How?

24:27.099 --> 24:29.306
McCourt has no phone to follow.

24:33.872 --> 24:36.375
It's a tracker.
Do you know who gave you this?

24:36.542 --> 24:39.716
No idea. It was given to me
at a fundraiser a week ago.

24:39.878 --> 24:42.552
More operatives will be arriving soon.
We need to go.

24:52.291 --> 24:54.669
We should leave the beltway.
We'll need a new car.

24:54.827 --> 24:57.831
Or an old one, easier to hotwire.

25:02.901 --> 25:03.902
Take McCourt.

25:16.048 --> 25:18.494
This guy again.
He's like a cockroach.

25:20.419 --> 25:23.263
Sounds like our last escape route
is about to disappear.

25:23.422 --> 25:26.062
I'm more comfortable
shooting this guy than the cops.

25:48.280 --> 25:49.782
You guys going my Way?

25:54.053 --> 25:56.334
<i>Congressman was
abducted by a white male,</i>

25:56.358 --> 25:57.961
<i>Six-three, dark hair, in suit.</i>

25:58.123 --> 26:00.569
<i>Be advised, suspect is armed
and extremely dangerous.</i>

26:00.726 --> 26:04.401
Nice car, Shaw.
So how'd you know we'd be there?

26:04.563 --> 26:06.941
I didn't... until five minutes ago.

26:07.099 --> 26:08.806
I got a call from Root.

26:10.102 --> 26:12.222
- So you're the one we're saving?
- Yeah. Who are you?

26:12.271 --> 26:14.148
Right now I'm the getaway driver.

26:14.273 --> 26:16.583
Heh. Boy, this just gets worse.

26:16.742 --> 26:17.743
Cheer up, Mac.

26:17.876 --> 26:20.276
You could be in the trunk
with the guy who wants to kill you.

26:36.495 --> 26:39.101
We can't go back.
It's too dangerous.

26:40.666 --> 26:42.346
I could try blasting
through the roadblock.

26:42.501 --> 26:44.481
<i>The term "blasting"</i>

26:44.636 --> 26:47.276
does not inspire great
confidence, Ms. Shaw.

26:50.642 --> 26:53.486
Time to get some fresh air.
I'll get the guy in the trunk.

26:53.645 --> 26:54.646
Let's go.

26:57.783 --> 27:02.095
<i>Sir, you need
to pull forward please. Thank you.</i>

27:02.254 --> 27:04.996
Time to stretch your legs.

27:24.443 --> 27:25.547
All clear.

27:25.711 --> 27:29.557
Newspapers in the driveway,
mail piled up. Must be on vacation.

27:30.382 --> 27:32.384
Let's hope they decide
to stay another night.

27:32.551 --> 27:33.894
What now?

27:35.354 --> 27:36.458
Some answers.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.906
Look, I don't know how many times
I have to tell you,

27:45.063 --> 27:48.567
I haven't done anything
to make anybody wanna kill me.

27:48.734 --> 27:51.180
Well, until we determine the reason

27:51.336 --> 27:54.408
that Decima keeps making attempts on
your life, you'll have to stay with us.

27:54.573 --> 27:57.884
- You have our Decima friend's phone?
- I pulled out the SIM card.

27:58.043 --> 28:01.923
If you really wanna protect me,
why don't you just take me to the cops?

28:02.080 --> 28:03.582
Law enforcement is no deterrent

28:03.749 --> 28:05.469
to the people coming after you,
Congressman.

28:05.551 --> 28:07.087
This is insane.

28:07.252 --> 28:10.358
You've obviously done something
to attract their attention.

28:10.522 --> 28:12.229
Like what?

28:12.391 --> 28:14.268
Decima is a private
intelligence company

28:14.426 --> 28:18.101
developing a large-scale
surveillance program.

28:18.263 --> 28:21.107
The type of program
that you've been vocally against.

28:21.266 --> 28:22.904
Along with half the Congress. So?

28:23.068 --> 28:25.514
But your position on the rules
committee gives you the power

28:25.671 --> 28:27.947
to alter or halt legislation.

28:28.106 --> 28:30.848
Have you sidelined anything
that would affect Decima's plans?

28:31.009 --> 28:34.286
No. I don't know anything
about that company

28:34.446 --> 28:38.189
or why they would wanna kill me.
This is all just a huge mistake.

28:39.117 --> 28:40.790
We're not getting anywhere here.

28:40.953 --> 28:42.796
Maybe Shaw's having some luck.

28:46.358 --> 28:48.031
You can talk or bleed out.

28:48.193 --> 28:50.901
You help us, we'll help you.

28:53.065 --> 28:54.772
Suit yourself, tough guy.

28:54.933 --> 28:56.935
Hope it's worth dying for.

28:57.102 --> 28:58.604
That may not be necessary.

29:00.072 --> 29:02.643
I was able to get into his phone
through a key vulnerability

29:02.808 --> 29:04.754
in the SMS encryption.

29:04.910 --> 29:07.390
I think we may
have misread this situation.

29:10.782 --> 29:11.783
Protect?

29:11.950 --> 29:13.554
Seems we're not the only ones
concerned

29:13.819 --> 29:15.423
with the congressman's safety.

29:15.887 --> 29:18.766
So who are you supposed
to be protecting McCourt from?

29:24.129 --> 29:26.166
I wasn't given that information.

29:27.332 --> 29:30.404
But in the week
we've been watching him,

29:30.569 --> 29:33.743
the only ones who have
taken a shot at him are you.

29:42.147 --> 29:43.148
Ah.

29:43.348 --> 29:45.350
You think maybe I could get a coffee?

29:48.520 --> 29:51.000
Or some water would be fine.

29:51.156 --> 29:53.636
Mr. McCourt, you're sure you
have no knowledge of Decima?

29:53.792 --> 29:55.169
I already answered that.

29:56.028 --> 29:59.498
- Why do you keep beating that drum?
Because they're protecting you.

29:59.665 --> 30:01.372
Protecting me?

30:01.533 --> 30:03.493
A minute ago you said
they were trying to kill me.

30:03.517 --> 30:04.517
I did.

30:05.037 --> 30:06.516
Something doesn't add up.

30:06.672 --> 30:08.811
Actually I think it might.

30:08.974 --> 30:12.012
I looked into your finances
earlier today, Congressman.

30:12.177 --> 30:13.212
You did what?

30:13.378 --> 30:17.190
I noticed your stock portfolio,
up 20 percent over last year.

30:17.349 --> 30:18.521
What are you getting at?

30:18.684 --> 30:20.129
Your trading activities.

30:20.285 --> 30:22.526
Your portfolio is up 20 percent
due to trades

30:22.688 --> 30:24.463
you've made in the last two weeks.

30:24.623 --> 30:29.299
Trades that have increased in value
by over 600 percent.

30:29.461 --> 30:31.737
- So?
- So...

30:31.897 --> 30:34.377
either you're the smartest investor
in Washington,

30:34.533 --> 30:37.343
or you're getting
some very good information.

30:37.502 --> 30:39.038
Inside information.

30:39.204 --> 30:40.877
I don't like what you're implying.

30:41.039 --> 30:43.041
It's more than an implication,
Congressman,

30:43.208 --> 30:45.745
and it'll become a call
to an SEC investigator I know

30:45.911 --> 30:48.255
unless you're more truthful with us.

30:50.649 --> 30:52.094
Okay-

30:56.254 --> 30:58.393
I know Decima Technologies.

31:00.759 --> 31:04.400
But they're not trying to kill me.
We have an understanding.

31:04.563 --> 31:06.770
What kind of an understanding?

31:06.932 --> 31:09.003
They were looking
for a little legislative support

31:09.167 --> 31:10.908
for their new surveillance program.

31:11.069 --> 31:12.241
Support?

31:12.404 --> 31:15.283
You've been leading the charge
against government surveillance.

31:15.440 --> 31:20.014
Course I have. 'Cause I realized that
the government can't keep a secret.

31:20.178 --> 31:23.955
You look at Prism
and this Northern Lights mess.

31:24.116 --> 31:26.790
What do you know
about Decima's program?

31:26.952 --> 31:28.022
Not much really.

31:28.186 --> 31:30.962
Just that it's an alternative
to a government-run system,

31:31.123 --> 31:33.933
which, at this point,
should make everybody happy.

31:34.092 --> 31:38.131
And in return for your support,
you're getting insider stock tips.

31:38.296 --> 31:42.438
You're a couple of smart guys,
you know?

31:42.601 --> 31:46.071
Surely you understand that everything
that happens in Washington is a deal.

31:46.238 --> 31:48.616
And you're a dealmaker.

31:49.474 --> 31:51.147
In case you didn't know,

31:51.309 --> 31:55.052
the business of governance...
is business.

32:08.493 --> 32:10.573
They're moving grid-to-grid
through the neighborhood.

32:10.597 --> 32:11.940
We need to make a move.

32:21.606 --> 32:24.280
Greer is positioning Samaritan
to replace the Machine.

32:24.443 --> 32:26.252
McCourt is helping Decima.

32:26.411 --> 32:27.754
We've been looking at him
as a victim,

32:27.846 --> 32:29.086
but he's really a perpetrator.

32:29.247 --> 32:31.591
I'm not so sure. His involvement
is tangential at best,

32:31.750 --> 32:33.252
and he doesn't
know Greens intentions.

32:33.418 --> 32:35.091
If he's not a victim or a perp,

32:35.153 --> 32:36.873
then why did the Machine
give us his number?

32:36.922 --> 32:39.664
What is it we're supposed
to be stopping?

32:39.825 --> 32:42.601
I'm not sure we're supposed
to be stopping anything.

32:42.761 --> 32:45.332
Finch, you said McCourt could
speed up or halt legislation.

32:45.497 --> 32:47.272
Yes, he's in
a unique position to remove

32:47.432 --> 32:49.309
any legislative
roadblock to Samaritan.

32:49.468 --> 32:53.814
So without McCourt,
Samaritan doesn't get past Congress.

32:53.972 --> 32:57.351
And Greer wouldn't get access
to the NSA's surveillance feeds.

33:01.680 --> 33:03.182
Then that's why we got his number.

33:04.216 --> 33:05.320
He is the victim.

33:06.685 --> 33:07.959
His life is in danger.

33:08.119 --> 33:09.291
<i>But from who?</i>

33:11.556 --> 33:12.830
Us.

33:18.563 --> 33:21.237
I think the Machine
wants us to kill McCourt.

33:27.405 --> 33:29.578
- John, think about what you're saying.
- I have.

33:29.741 --> 33:31.846
Just because Decima
is not the threat to McCourt

33:32.043 --> 33:33.420
doesn't mean that we must be.

33:33.578 --> 33:35.658
The Machine is designed
to save lives, not take them.

33:35.682 --> 33:37.059
But could it?

33:37.215 --> 33:39.991
Could the Machine ever tell us
to kill someone? Is it possible?

33:42.687 --> 33:44.496
It's conceivable.

33:44.656 --> 33:46.431
Well, how bad would
the situation have to be?

33:46.591 --> 33:50.232
Bad. It would have to see
that an individual's actions

33:50.395 --> 33:52.602
could directly result
in the loss of others' lives.

33:52.764 --> 33:55.438
How many lives?
A dozen, a hundred? How many?

33:55.600 --> 33:57.881
A lot. I'm not sure.
I never dreamt it would come to this.

33:58.036 --> 33:59.777
Well, it has.

33:59.938 --> 34:02.885
Your machine,
it sees something coming,

34:03.041 --> 34:05.078
Something bad,
and it wants us to stop it.

34:05.243 --> 34:07.883
I don't know.
You don't know that.

34:08.045 --> 34:10.617
Look, I've never entirely trusted
your machine, but you built it,

34:10.782 --> 34:12.351
and I trust you.

34:12.516 --> 34:14.793
You're the one who said
we can't underestimate

34:14.953 --> 34:17.194
the threat of Samaritan.

34:26.598 --> 34:28.134
Mr. McCourt...

34:29.768 --> 34:31.610
you have to call off
your deal with Decima.

34:31.770 --> 34:36.411
Their surveillance program
cannot be approved.

34:36.574 --> 34:40.420
What are you, one of those privacy
nut jobs? Is that what this is about?

34:40.579 --> 34:44.049
With access to the government's
surveillance feeds,

34:44.215 --> 34:47.889
Decima will be able
to acquire any information,

34:48.053 --> 34:50.260
any secret it desires,

34:50.422 --> 34:52.299
and sell it to the highest bidder.

34:52.456 --> 34:54.458
And that would be
the United States government.

34:54.626 --> 34:56.161
Perhaps, for now.

34:56.328 --> 34:58.934
But unbridled access

34:59.097 --> 35:03.239
will create unlimited
opportunities for abuse.

35:04.336 --> 35:07.681
People will be ruined,
lives will be lost.

35:07.839 --> 35:10.683
The results will be nothing
short of catastrophic.

35:11.509 --> 35:15.685
These programs are always gonna
be controversial but also inevitable.

35:16.514 --> 35:19.017
People get up in arms
whenever they go public,

35:19.184 --> 35:21.858
but eventually the noise dies down,

35:22.020 --> 35:25.001
because the simple truth is

35:25.156 --> 35:27.432
that people wanna be protected.

35:29.327 --> 35:31.807
They just don't wanna know how.

35:35.333 --> 35:38.371
Oh, maybe I haven't
offered you the right incentive.

35:38.536 --> 35:39.640
So how much?

35:39.804 --> 35:41.112
Excuse me?

35:41.272 --> 35:44.810
To withdraw your support
for Decima's program, how much?

35:44.976 --> 35:48.048
Hey, you know,
I did this to keep the country safe.

35:48.213 --> 35:50.193
And, yeah,
maybe I got a little something

35:50.315 --> 35:52.022
for myself during the process.

35:53.151 --> 35:56.530
All that makes me
is good at what I do.

35:56.688 --> 35:59.225
I'm not calling off the deal.

36:07.332 --> 36:10.745
Looks like we've got company.
SWAT, feds, the works.

36:11.703 --> 36:13.410
Mr. Reese, it was never my intention

36:13.571 --> 36:16.313
for people to be killed
because of the Machine.

36:16.474 --> 36:18.715
What do you think happened
when it gave the government

36:18.877 --> 36:20.515
a terrorist number?

36:20.712 --> 36:22.472
What do you think
we used to do for a living?

36:22.496 --> 36:23.724
That man is not a terrorist.

36:23.882 --> 36:26.226
He's just an opportunistic
and corrupt pawn.

36:26.384 --> 36:28.762
That doesn't make
the threat any less real.

36:28.920 --> 36:30.558
We are not assassins.
We protect people.

36:30.722 --> 36:32.599
Isn't that what we're doing?

36:33.758 --> 36:37.035
Sacrificing the life
of one to save the lives of many?

36:37.896 --> 36:39.068
Shaw, help me out here.

36:41.199 --> 36:44.612
Six months ago, I would've already
put a bullet in that guy's head.

36:44.769 --> 36:47.010
But ever since hanging
around you guys, I've kind of

36:47.172 --> 36:49.516
gotten used to saving people
but we've only been able

36:49.674 --> 36:53.087
to do that by trusting the Machine.

36:53.244 --> 36:55.724
And if it's saying
that this guy's gotta go...

36:57.415 --> 36:59.190
Well, I think
we should still trust it.

37:01.419 --> 37:04.229
John, I urge you to consider
the consequences of this action.

37:04.389 --> 37:07.427
There are consequences to not acting.

37:07.592 --> 37:09.868
Like with Simmons and Joss.

37:10.028 --> 37:11.405
Don't do this.

37:11.563 --> 37:14.066
If we let him walk out that door,
Decima wins.

37:14.232 --> 37:15.540
Samaritan will go live.

37:15.700 --> 37:17.475
It's a possibility,
but not a certainty.

37:17.635 --> 37:19.979
There may be another way.
We've never been here.

37:20.138 --> 37:22.448
But are you really
willing to take that risk?

37:24.576 --> 37:25.987
Harold?

37:27.545 --> 37:30.924
Since we started this,
things have changed. We've changed.

37:31.082 --> 37:34.086
But the mission, our purpose,
has always been constant:

37:34.252 --> 37:35.822
to save lives.

37:36.788 --> 37:38.893
If that's changed somehow,

37:39.057 --> 37:41.059
if we're in a place now

37:41.226 --> 37:44.139
where the Machine is asking
us to commit murder...

37:47.565 --> 37:49.670
That's a place I can't go.

37:50.602 --> 37:53.242
I'm afraid this is where I get off.

37:59.344 --> 38:00.516
John.

39:15.253 --> 39:17.255
Unh!

39:49.120 --> 39:52.465
<i>You've had an opportunity
to consider my proposal.</i>

39:52.624 --> 39:54.399
Will you help us?

39:54.559 --> 39:55.919
My colleagues and I would like to,

39:56.060 --> 39:59.041
but unfortunately now
is not the time.

39:59.197 --> 40:01.473
Perhaps a demonstration
of my system's capabilities

40:01.633 --> 40:04.739
will convince you that your country
cannot afford to wait.

40:05.470 --> 40:08.041
<i>Test in a limited area,</i>

40:08.206 --> 40:10.982
<i>say... New York City.</i>

40:11.142 --> 40:14.248
<i>Twenty-four hours,
quick, clean.</i>

40:14.412 --> 40:16.323
<i>Then we shut it down.</i>

40:16.481 --> 40:20.486
<i>No guns, no police, just information.</i>

40:21.319 --> 40:22.639
<i>What kind of information?</i>

40:22.654 --> 40:25.066
If the NSA provides us

40:25.223 --> 40:27.829
with New York City's
surveillance feeds,

40:27.992 --> 40:30.302
we will find you a terrorist.

40:30.461 --> 40:32.381
<i>You could find me
a thousand terrorists,</i>

40:32.430 --> 40:35.434
<i>but like I said'
we'll never get this through Congress.</i>

40:35.600 --> 40:39.810
<i>And as I told you, dissenting
voices would not be a problem.</i>

41:10.835 --> 41:13.816
<i>It's time to remove those obstacles.</i>

41:16.007 --> 41:17.953
Answer your phone, Senator.

41:22.714 --> 41:26.059
How you doing, Garrison?
This is Roger McCourt.

41:26.217 --> 41:28.891
I understand you'll be
preparing some legislation.

41:29.053 --> 41:30.157
Is that right?

41:30.321 --> 41:31.823
<i>If you can handle the Senate,</i>

41:31.990 --> 41:35.403
I can ensure that the House rules
facilitate a quiet passage.

41:35.560 --> 41:37.062
You can do all that?

41:37.228 --> 41:38.901
Absolutely, Senator.

41:41.899 --> 41:44.539
Okay. Let's...

41:44.702 --> 41:46.340
- do it.
<i>- Excellent.</i>

41:46.504 --> 41:49.508
Now if there's anything
else you need, just ask.

41:49.674 --> 41:51.244
I'm your man.

42:26.411 --> 42:29.551
Virgil, are we operational?

42:29.714 --> 42:32.422
You're just in time
for the ribbon cutting.

42:32.583 --> 42:34.221
Feeds are coming online now.

42:34.385 --> 42:36.296
Commencing beta test.

42:40.024 --> 42:42.470
Okay, we have 24 hours.

42:42.627 --> 42:43.731
Splendid.

42:46.964 --> 42:50.036
Find me Harold Finch.
