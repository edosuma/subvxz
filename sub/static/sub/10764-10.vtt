WEBVTT

00:10.443 --> 00:11.910
I told them you were awake.

00:11.978 --> 00:14.572
Happy birthday, Geoffrey!

00:15.949 --> 00:17.974
I'm so touched.

00:18.051 --> 00:19.678
May I get you anything?

00:20.587 --> 00:21.747
Don't be silly.

00:21.821 --> 00:25.587
You're always worried about pleasing us,
but today it's Saturday, we're home...

00:25.658 --> 00:27.626
and we're waiting on you.

00:28.294 --> 00:30.057
This is highly irregular.

00:30.130 --> 00:31.825
I don't want to hear it.

00:31.998 --> 00:33.693
Today, we're your butlers.

00:34.501 --> 00:36.401
Here's breakfast in bed.

00:37.003 --> 00:39.301
Is there anything else you would like?

00:39.372 --> 00:40.862
A spot of tea.

00:45.345 --> 00:47.575
I'll get the tea.

00:47.647 --> 00:49.137
Would you like anything with that?

00:49.215 --> 00:51.706
Geoffrey, relax. It's your birthday.

00:51.785 --> 00:54.083
We're gonna do
all of your most hated chores.

00:54.154 --> 00:56.679
But, sir, I don't hate any of my chores.

00:56.756 --> 00:58.155
We do.

00:59.025 --> 01:01.960
Are you going to do
anything special for your birthday?

01:02.028 --> 01:03.757
Most assuredly, Miss Ashley.

01:03.830 --> 01:08.790
<i>Tonight, I'll be enjoying a BBC broadcast
of Gilbert and Sullivan's HMS Pinafore...</i>

01:09.002 --> 01:11.971
followed by a penetrating interview
by David Frost.

01:13.840 --> 01:15.933
And they say the man can't party.

01:17.577 --> 01:19.442
Before we get you your tea...

01:19.512 --> 01:22.003
there's something else
we'd like to do for you.

01:23.616 --> 01:26.346
Carlton, put away
that tired old kazoo, please.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.980
Get busy for me one time, Skinny A.

01:30.056 --> 01:31.921
"Happy birthday, my man G

01:31.991 --> 01:34.016
"Because you know the most
About butlery

01:34.094 --> 01:36.289
"So don't move an inch, stay where you sit

01:36.362 --> 01:38.922
"We're going to treat you like
The King of Brit"

01:40.000 --> 01:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:50.336 --> 02:53.828
Did you see that look on Geoffrey's face?
He just lit up.

02:53.907 --> 02:56.569
I never thought I'd say this,
but it feels really good...

02:56.643 --> 02:59.271
to do something for somebody else
for a change.

02:59.345 --> 03:01.506
Aren't we supposed
to make him some tea?

03:01.581 --> 03:03.310
Right.

03:03.383 --> 03:05.647
How'd you like to go into the kitchen...

03:05.718 --> 03:09.415
and introduce Mr. Tea Bag and Mr. Teapot
to Mr. Boiling Water?

03:10.623 --> 03:14.559
Hilary, how'd you like to make the tea
before I take away Mr. Allowance?

03:14.928 --> 03:18.125
Mother, please. Don't talk down to me.

03:21.267 --> 03:24.031
Yo, I got it.
I know what I'm getting G for his birthday.

03:24.103 --> 03:26.333
- What?
- Let me give you a hint.

03:33.012 --> 03:34.536
Little Richard?

03:37.383 --> 03:38.782
Shut up.

03:40.920 --> 03:43.821
No. I want to hook Geoffrey up
with a woman...

03:43.890 --> 03:45.687
so he can get busy.

03:45.758 --> 03:49.694
I think Geoffrey's busy enough,
what with all his chores.

03:51.497 --> 03:52.862
You don't get it.

03:53.766 --> 03:56.860
Look, it's Geoffrey's birthday,
and he's just staying up...

03:56.936 --> 04:00.463
listening to his radio.
Straight up, the man's depressed.

04:00.540 --> 04:02.804
No, he's not depressed. He's British.

04:03.743 --> 04:05.734
It's the man's birthday. Leave him alone.

04:05.812 --> 04:07.040
If Geoffrey's interested...

04:07.113 --> 04:10.378
I don't see any harm
in introducing him to a nice woman.

04:10.450 --> 04:13.647
- Here she goes.
- Here what goes?

04:13.720 --> 04:16.620
Your poor Aunt Vivian
seems to think she's a matchmaker.

04:16.689 --> 04:19.783
In her mind,
she's the Chuck Woolery of Bel-Air.

04:21.060 --> 04:22.322
It's not just my opinion.

04:22.395 --> 04:25.330
When I was in college,
I introduced three couples...

04:25.398 --> 04:27.093
and they all got married.

04:27.166 --> 04:29.794
And by your fifth reunion,
they were all divorced.

04:30.303 --> 04:33.864
I just get them to the altar.
After that, they're on their own.

04:34.440 --> 04:38.274
People, people, please.
I don't want to hear your dirty laundry.

04:39.112 --> 04:43.879
Geoffrey deserves a woman interested
in a serious, long-lasting relationship.

04:44.384 --> 04:46.784
And I know exactly where to find her.

04:48.021 --> 04:49.352
The mall.

04:57.163 --> 04:59.063
Wait till Geoffrey sees this.

04:59.132 --> 05:02.192
When I'm done,
he won't have to polish this for a month.

05:02.302 --> 05:05.294
- I can see myself.
- I can't.

05:11.444 --> 05:13.173
Stay smooth.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.311
Don't buckle.

05:19.085 --> 05:21.553
Hilary, what's the problem?

05:21.621 --> 05:26.183
I've never wrapped a present before.
Geoffrey's always wrapped my presents.

05:27.927 --> 05:31.124
Hilary, you can't ask him
to wrap his own present.

05:31.798 --> 05:35.097
I guess that's another one
of those unwritten rules.

05:36.102 --> 05:37.194
Man!

05:37.637 --> 05:40.834
Two hours at the mall,
and I ain't get no girls.

05:40.907 --> 05:44.809
What did you expect?
You went to the mall with girl-away there.

05:50.416 --> 05:54.216
For your information, Hilary,
Jazz here happens to be the master...

05:54.287 --> 05:57.950
when it comes to cracking on the girls.
The boy is irresistible.

05:58.024 --> 06:00.254
Sure, maybe during a blackout.

06:02.929 --> 06:05.727
I'd love to get a hold of you
during a blackout.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.061
Daddy.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.972
That's better. Now, where were we?

06:21.047 --> 06:25.450
In honor of Geoffrey's birthday,
we are preparing an incredible feast.

06:25.818 --> 06:29.015
Beef Stroganoff, Potatoes au Gratin,
and Apple Brown Betty.

06:29.088 --> 06:31.056
It sounds delicious. When will it be ready?

06:31.124 --> 06:34.025
In 55 seconds. Just tell us when to zap it.

06:36.229 --> 06:39.960
Could you put a hold on dinner, please?
I'm trying to find Geoffrey a girl.

06:40.032 --> 06:42.557
The words "mission impossible"
come to mind.

06:43.636 --> 06:45.604
- I know someone.
- Really?

06:46.038 --> 06:47.869
You know my friend Samantha?

06:49.075 --> 06:53.136
Maybe I should explain
some of the finer points of the law to you.

06:53.913 --> 06:57.246
I was going to say
that Samantha has this sweet nanny...

06:57.316 --> 06:58.749
who just came from England.

06:58.818 --> 07:02.720
She says Helen has nothing to do.
She just sits in her room at night knitting.

07:02.789 --> 07:04.381
I smell a match.

07:04.891 --> 07:06.984
How long has this nanny been in America?

07:07.059 --> 07:08.083
Two weeks.

07:08.561 --> 07:11.997
Perfect. A Ionely woman,
new to our country...

07:12.064 --> 07:15.295
she probably won't even notice
what a Melvin Geoffrey is.

07:16.235 --> 07:17.668
Yo, Geoffrey.

07:18.738 --> 07:22.731
Ashley, you go invite her.
The rest of y'all beat it.

07:25.178 --> 07:27.078
You bellowed, Master William?

07:28.648 --> 07:29.945
I've been thinking about it.

07:30.016 --> 07:32.644
I'm not down with you
being Ionely on your birthday.

07:32.785 --> 07:35.185
I shall be far from Ionely.

07:35.254 --> 07:38.690
I shall be spending the evening
with the glorious music...

07:38.758 --> 07:41.693
of Sir William Schwenck Gilbert
and Sir Arthur Sullivan...

07:41.761 --> 07:43.752
not to mention David Frost.

07:44.096 --> 07:46.997
So far, I count you plus three guys.

07:48.468 --> 07:51.232
I just thought you might prefer a woman.

07:52.905 --> 07:55.999
I'm not making
too big an assumption here, am I?

08:01.781 --> 08:05.148
As it happens, I like women just fine.

08:05.218 --> 08:09.245
But I think it's a bad idea
for a butler to intertwine his private life...

08:09.322 --> 08:10.482
with that of the family.

08:10.556 --> 08:14.185
<i>Surely you gleaned that much
from watching Mr. Belvedere.</i>

08:14.794 --> 08:18.059
But, G, there's this nice old British nanny
that Ashley knows...

08:18.130 --> 08:20.155
she really wants to go out with you.

08:20.233 --> 08:23.760
- Sorry, Master William.
- But Ashley already invited her.

08:23.836 --> 08:24.962
What?

08:25.037 --> 08:28.006
I told her that was a little pushy,
but you know kids.

08:29.075 --> 08:30.736
This is just regrettable.

08:30.810 --> 08:32.937
It ain't so bad, G.

08:33.011 --> 08:37.676
I mean, it's your patriotic duty
to show your countrywoman a good time.

08:38.317 --> 08:40.342
G, don't do it for yourself.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.486
Do it for the King.

08:46.425 --> 08:49.485
I wouldn't want to disappoint
King Elizabeth.

09:01.440 --> 09:03.237
Helen is going to be here any minute.

09:03.309 --> 09:06.301
- Baby, hook it up.
- I'm hooking as fast as I can.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.279
Don't be such a wanker.

09:10.016 --> 09:12.143
- What are you going to wear?
- Voilà.

09:12.218 --> 09:13.583
No.

09:18.724 --> 09:19.986
Come on, G.

09:20.059 --> 09:23.119
Hilary's taking you and Helen
to the fliest club in LA.

09:23.195 --> 09:26.323
Jazz is the DJ there.
He said the place is all of that.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.889
All what?

09:29.635 --> 09:33.162
Look, forget it.
I don't think you understand, man.

09:33.239 --> 09:37.266
You got a kind of a Ben Vereen thing
going here, man.

09:42.148 --> 09:44.946
Come on, baby.
You got to dress a lot funkier than that.

09:45.017 --> 09:46.177
Funkier?

09:50.790 --> 09:54.123
There. Pure, unadulterated funk.

09:56.896 --> 09:59.228
All right, look, G,
forget about looking cool.

09:59.298 --> 10:01.289
Let's concentrate on acting cool.

10:01.367 --> 10:03.767
Don't talk to me about cool.

10:03.836 --> 10:07.863
During the '70s, I was briefly employed
as Led Zeppelin's road butler.

10:10.509 --> 10:13.637
When the music is pumping
and it's time to go on the dance floor...

10:13.713 --> 10:15.578
this is what you do.

10:35.368 --> 10:37.393
Now you give it a try.

10:39.739 --> 10:43.698
I would be most happy to,
but to the best of my knowledge...

10:43.776 --> 10:46.574
hell has not yet frozen over.

10:51.484 --> 10:55.420
Madam, sir. A round-trip ticket to England.

10:55.488 --> 10:56.477
Thank you.

10:56.555 --> 10:59.046
We thought it would be nice for you
to see your family.

10:59.125 --> 11:01.889
Yes, I suppose I should drop in on them.

11:03.329 --> 11:07.026
This is from Ashley and me.
I paid the lion's share.

11:08.401 --> 11:10.062
Happy birthday, Geoffrey.

11:10.136 --> 11:11.933
English Leather.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.169
English toffee.

11:14.974 --> 11:16.942
An English muffin.

11:19.445 --> 11:23.677
That sounds like my present, G,
but I'll leave the unwrapping to you.

11:24.283 --> 11:26.581
Will, must you be so ribald?

11:26.652 --> 11:29.746
I won't answer that
without a lawyer and a dictionary.

11:31.490 --> 11:33.321
I'll get Helen.

11:33.392 --> 11:36.418
Here's my present, Geoffrey.
Happy birthday.

11:36.796 --> 11:38.286
I wrapped it myself.

11:39.432 --> 11:41.525
Thank you, Miss Hilary.

11:43.903 --> 11:46.303
This is most generous.

11:46.372 --> 11:51.332
I know I boss you around too much.
This gift is my way of making up for it.

11:51.410 --> 11:54.470
Hilary, sweetheart,
you could also stop bossing him around.

11:56.082 --> 11:58.243
Okay, then I'll keep the sweater.

11:59.952 --> 12:02.853
- He's right this way, Helen.
- Happy birthday, G.

12:02.922 --> 12:05.618
Get ready to have your candles blown out.

12:06.692 --> 12:10.651
Geoffrey, I'd like you to meet
Samantha's nanny, Helen Carter.

12:24.276 --> 12:26.710
Helen, I'd like you to meet Geoffrey.

12:27.079 --> 12:29.570
- Charmed.
- It's nice to meet you.

12:29.648 --> 12:32.776
From the children's description,
I thought you'd be much older.

12:32.852 --> 12:33.841
Ditto.

12:36.355 --> 12:38.915
And this is my mom, my dad...

12:38.991 --> 12:41.357
Hilary, Will, and Carlton.

12:44.063 --> 12:45.655
You can call me Tony.

12:51.804 --> 12:54.773
What are you trying to pull here,
Tony the Tiger?

12:55.441 --> 12:59.207
I didn't start it.
Did you see the way she looked at me?

12:59.545 --> 13:01.342
Share the fantasy, Carlton.

13:02.481 --> 13:04.745
I was just trying to be friendly.

13:04.817 --> 13:08.719
Park your welcome wagon elsewhere.
That's Geoffrey's date.

13:08.788 --> 13:12.519
She'll be dancing with him,
but she'll be thinking of me.

13:16.896 --> 13:19.694
So, Helen, I'm Will.

13:20.032 --> 13:22.023
Welcome to our humble crib.

13:23.536 --> 13:26.733
Ashley, this must be
that houseboy you were telling me about.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.205
That's homeboy.

13:32.478 --> 13:33.809
Sorry.

13:36.048 --> 13:38.380
I'm so glad
you could make it tonight, Helen.

13:38.450 --> 13:40.714
This is working out just beautifully.

13:40.786 --> 13:43.584
The two of you
look so wonderful together.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.648
How many lives
do you have to ruin, Vivian?

13:47.693 --> 13:50.389
Helen, what part of England are you from?

13:50.462 --> 13:54.455
Allow me, Miss Hilary.
You can tell a lot from a person's accent.

13:55.701 --> 13:57.532
You're from London, of course.

13:57.603 --> 14:00.572
- Of course.
- I'm guessing West End.

14:00.906 --> 14:02.806
- Why, yes.
- Chilton Road?

14:02.875 --> 14:05.867
- That's right.
- Upstairs above Shrimpton & Son.

14:05.945 --> 14:08.846
Close. One more block up,
next to Bottomleys.

14:09.348 --> 14:11.077
It has been a while.

14:14.720 --> 14:18.383
Isn't this cute?
You two have so much in common.

14:18.457 --> 14:20.391
You both speak English.

14:29.768 --> 14:34.569
To this day, it remains the largest rhino
ever to be taken with a bow and arrow.

14:36.075 --> 14:40.671
Geoffrey, this is fascinating.
It's like going out with James Bond.

14:41.413 --> 14:44.507
You're not the first
to have made that comparison.

14:46.452 --> 14:50.786
I'm going to go mingle.
The "A" list turned out tonight.

14:50.856 --> 14:51.982
Really?

14:52.057 --> 14:55.083
Look. That's Tom Cruise's pool cleaner.

14:55.160 --> 14:57.287
And that's Cher's electrolysist.

14:57.763 --> 14:59.788
And that's Heather Locklear.

15:04.036 --> 15:06.504
Hey, beautiful, I see
you've come to make up.

15:06.839 --> 15:09.865
What's with the Band-Aid?
Was your brain leaking?

15:10.709 --> 15:14.201
I hit the pavement kind of hard
when your dad threw me out of the house.

15:14.280 --> 15:16.510
You could call it a love scar.

15:17.116 --> 15:19.550
Perhaps I haven't been clear in the past.

15:19.618 --> 15:21.381
I don't like talking to you.

15:21.453 --> 15:25.514
I don't even like seeing you.
So please, just go away.

15:25.591 --> 15:27.081
I love a flirt.

15:35.868 --> 15:39.497
Will, what are you doing here?
Leave Geoffrey and Helen alone.

15:39.571 --> 15:42.062
What do you think I am?

15:42.141 --> 15:45.770
I'm down here merely to hang out
with my good friend Jazz.

15:46.445 --> 15:48.913
While you're here at it, hose him down.

15:49.114 --> 15:52.345
I got to run.
There's Demi Moore's cable man.

15:55.287 --> 15:58.279
- Yo, J, what up, baby?
- Yo.

16:01.060 --> 16:03.756
Your cousin's really starting
to warm up to me.

16:04.897 --> 16:06.387
Yeah, right.

16:06.632 --> 16:10.090
- What's wrong with you?
- Peep out that babe G's with.

16:11.303 --> 16:12.964
You mean Wonder Woman?

16:13.038 --> 16:15.563
Check this out.
I got the worst luck in the world.

16:15.641 --> 16:18.804
All the babes I mess with in Bel-Air
been whacked, right?

16:19.111 --> 16:20.601
I follow you so far.

16:21.013 --> 16:23.948
I go to hook G up
with an old British nanny...

16:24.616 --> 16:26.243
it turns out to be her.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.181
She don't look too old to me.

16:29.621 --> 16:31.782
I know, Jazz. She's perfect.

16:31.857 --> 16:33.950
Homey, I'm in love.

16:34.126 --> 16:37.584
G didn't even want to go out with her
in the first place.

16:38.364 --> 16:40.491
I don't know what you guys do in Philly...

16:40.566 --> 16:43.729
but in LA,
we don't give stuff like that away.

16:49.274 --> 16:51.242
I don't know what you guys do in LA...

16:51.310 --> 16:55.178
but in Philly, you crack on
somebody's honey, you get yourself killed.

16:55.247 --> 17:00.184
I don't know what you guys do in Philly,
but in LA, we men have to take that risk.

17:03.622 --> 17:06.352
Yo, brother, you want to take this outside?

17:06.825 --> 17:10.420
Calm down, man. Listen.
Tell me, how's your butler dance?

17:10.496 --> 17:12.292
Like he dresses. Why?

17:12.731 --> 17:16.258
I'll throw on some house music,
he can't hang out on the dance floor.

17:16.335 --> 17:18.326
You can pick up all the pieces.

17:20.973 --> 17:24.271
<i>We got a brother in the house tonight.
He's celebrating his birthday.</i>

17:24.343 --> 17:25.776
<i>He's my main man Geoffrey.</i>

17:25.844 --> 17:29.780
<i>Clear the dance floor,
and let him and his lady get busy.</i>

17:30.682 --> 17:33.515
Helen, care to cut a rug?

17:33.886 --> 17:35.615
Smashing.

17:51.437 --> 17:53.132
Like an angel in flight.

17:54.139 --> 17:56.630
Yeah, he is better than I thought he'd be.

18:07.853 --> 18:10.515
They're doing the lambada.

18:12.791 --> 18:14.918
That's the forbidden dance.

18:29.508 --> 18:32.306
<i>It's like this, right?
Mississippi Burning, right?</i>

18:33.312 --> 18:35.712
I'm getting that feeling of déjà vu.

18:47.659 --> 18:50.628
I'm trying to concentrate.
Could you turn that down?

18:51.230 --> 18:53.027
I'm sorry, honey.

18:53.398 --> 18:55.298
Maybe this will help.

19:02.441 --> 19:03.931
It's Saturday night.

19:04.476 --> 19:07.309
We always used to go out dancing
Saturday nights.

19:07.946 --> 19:10.938
Maybe we can do some in-house dancing.

19:38.977 --> 19:42.572
- What are you doing home?
- Man, I sort of bounced home.

19:43.248 --> 19:45.842
- They threw me out of the club.
- Why?

19:46.418 --> 19:50.252
It all started when your man Geoffrey
started doing the lambada.

19:50.322 --> 19:51.789
Geoffrey does the lambada?

19:51.857 --> 19:53.722
That's the forbidden dance.

19:58.764 --> 20:02.256
You guys missed the night of the year.

20:02.334 --> 20:06.668
Geoffrey is an amazing dancer.
He was doing back flips.

20:07.873 --> 20:09.568
Back flips?

20:10.375 --> 20:12.570
Isn't he cute?

20:12.744 --> 20:15.212
- Good night, Geoffrey.
- Good night, Miss Hilary.

20:15.280 --> 20:17.043
Yes, I think we'll go up, too.

20:17.115 --> 20:20.915
Good night, everyone,
and thanks for a lovely birthday.

20:23.555 --> 20:25.386
- Yo, G?
- Yes?

20:25.457 --> 20:26.947
Hold on.

20:30.162 --> 20:34.223
I shouldn't have busted your groove
at the club.

20:35.834 --> 20:40.203
I guess what I want to say is
it's all Jazz's fault, man.

20:42.541 --> 20:44.031
Sit down, lad.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.769
Master William...

20:48.580 --> 20:52.107
for you, a birthday is a time
to paint the town red...

20:52.417 --> 20:56.012
but for me, it's a time of reflection.

20:56.088 --> 20:59.421
A time to review
one's successes and regrets.

21:00.092 --> 21:04.256
One of my regrets has always been
the fact that I never had a son.

21:04.997 --> 21:08.398
I have so much advice
to pass on to the next generation.

21:09.167 --> 21:10.896
But no one to tell it to.

21:11.336 --> 21:12.860
Look at the time.

21:15.040 --> 21:16.530
Boy, I'm bushed.

21:18.477 --> 21:20.240
Sit, William.

21:24.950 --> 21:28.886
My boy, a man is much more...

21:28.954 --> 21:32.185
than the job he holds
or the clothes he wears.

21:32.724 --> 21:36.956
For example, if I were to judge you
by your costume...

21:37.029 --> 21:40.465
I should guess
you were some kind of circus performer.

21:42.534 --> 21:44.126
That's pretty cold, G.

21:46.004 --> 21:48.905
But you made
the same assumptions about me.

21:49.474 --> 21:51.442
You assumed I was Ionely.

21:51.877 --> 21:55.438
You assumed I couldn't comport myself
at a nightspot.

21:55.514 --> 21:58.449
You assumed I was a poor dancer.

21:59.184 --> 22:01.448
I hope the events of tonight
have proved to you...

22:01.520 --> 22:03.852
that I am, as the saying goes...

22:04.222 --> 22:06.213
a fairly fly individual.

22:11.763 --> 22:13.492
Helen sure thinks so.

22:15.867 --> 22:18.631
She's certainly a hot little number.

22:19.404 --> 22:21.872
But I'm afraid she and I were mismatched.

22:22.240 --> 22:26.336
- She was a little too young for you?
- Quite the contrary.

22:26.578 --> 22:29.979
I am afraid I was a little too intimidating
for the poor girl.

22:30.482 --> 22:33.849
She's looking for someone a little slower...

22:34.586 --> 22:36.486
a little less sophisticated.

22:36.555 --> 22:40.355
I could be slower.
I'm sure I could be less sophisticated.

22:41.860 --> 22:43.327
She sensed that.

22:46.698 --> 22:49.690
Here's her phone number.
She's expecting your call.

22:53.839 --> 22:57.036
It isn't important
that I got the date with Helen.

22:58.076 --> 22:59.338
The important thing is...

22:59.411 --> 23:02.608
I learned to appreciate Geoffrey
as a human being.

23:04.216 --> 23:07.208
And Geoffrey and I
have a deeper relationship.
