JOHANNE RIISER CALLING

02:05.960 --> 02:07.240
STARTING VIDEO

02:08.120 --> 02:11.120
-Hi, daddy.
-Hi, buddy.

02:11.200 --> 02:14.360
Lovely to see you. How's it going?

02:14.440 --> 02:17.640
I'm good. How are you?

02:17.720 --> 02:20.720
I'm good.
What've you been up to today?

02:20.800 --> 02:23.920
Nothing special, really.
How about you?

02:24.000 --> 02:27.440
We went to the market, and then...

02:27.520 --> 02:30.600
We were buying a goat, for food.

02:30.680 --> 02:35.520
Then Jon Petter found a place
where we could buy cold cokes.

02:35.600 --> 02:37.920
So we stood there for a while.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.840
Then we came back here,
and I slept for a while.

02:41.920 --> 02:46.080
-And then we played a game of cards.
-Who won?

02:46.160 --> 02:49.160
Sigurd, who's really good at cards.

02:49.240 --> 02:53.120
Jon Petter tried to cheat,
without any success.

02:53.200 --> 02:58.280
Then I exercised a bit,
and I've had dinner.

02:58.360 --> 03:01.960
And now I'll sleep a little more.

03:02.040 --> 03:05.400
-A bit slack.
-Yes, it's a bit slack.

03:05.480 --> 03:09.200
-What have you done?
-We had a math test.

03:09.280 --> 03:13.360
-How did it go?
-I fell asleep.

03:13.440 --> 03:16.360
You didn't fall asleep
during the test?

03:16.440 --> 03:21.280
No, I'm only joking.
When are you coming home?

03:23.000 --> 03:27.080
It'll be a little while longer
until I'll be home.

03:27.160 --> 03:32.080
People keep asking if I'm worried.

03:32.160 --> 03:33.960
Worried about me?

03:34.040 --> 03:36.080
-Yes.
-What do you say?

03:36.160 --> 03:38.960
No, I just say...

03:39.040 --> 03:43.960
-Everyone thinks it's so dangerous...
-Who's asking?

03:44.040 --> 03:47.920
My teachers and classmates.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.640
Okay.

03:50.680 --> 03:55.360
You know that it's a bit dangerous,
but that dad's careful, right?

03:55.440 --> 04:00.680
That's the difference.
What happens when you're careful?

04:00.760 --> 04:05.200
-Then everything will be fine.
-Good.

04:05.280 --> 04:09.520
-Do you want to talk with mummy?
-Alright. Sleep tight.

04:09.600 --> 04:14.640
-Night. Mum's coming soon.
-Okay. Sleep tight.

04:19.920 --> 04:25.080
9-8, we've received reliable info
of a possible suicide attack.

04:25.160 --> 04:30.200
The hospital is the target and
the adjacent market is under threat.

04:30.280 --> 04:34.960
From the roofs we have a view
of the market and the roads.

04:35.040 --> 04:37.920
3-2-Charlie and 3-2-Delta
on the hospital roof.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.920
3-2-Alpha, 3-2-Bravo: Eastern roof.
3-2-Echo, 3-2-Golf: Southern roof.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.360
My position is by the cars
with 3-2-Fox and 3-4-Lima.

04:46.440 --> 04:49.320
Notify me when you're in position.

05:56.440 --> 06:01.880
-All good?
-Yes. 3-Alpha, 3-2-Charlie.

06:01.960 --> 06:06.240
-3-Alpha reading you.
-3-2-Charlie and 3-2-Delta

06:06.320 --> 06:09.600
are in position
on the hospital roof.

06:09.680 --> 06:11.840
-Copy.
-Out.

06:13.160 --> 06:16.880
-Calling 3-Alpha. This is 3-2-Echo.
-3-Alpha reading you.

06:16.960 --> 06:20.680
3-2-Echo and 3-2-Golf are
in position on the southern roof.

06:20.760 --> 06:22.240
Copy.

06:25.480 --> 06:30.360
-3-Alpha, this is 3-2-Alpha.
-3-Alpha reading you.

06:30.440 --> 06:35.160
3-2-Alpha and 3-2-Bravo
in position on the eastern roof.

06:37.320 --> 06:38.800
Copy.

06:58.040 --> 07:02.440
Man under the eaves.
9-8, we've spotted a threat.

07:02.520 --> 07:06.000
In the north-eastern
part of the market.

07:06.080 --> 07:08.280
By the pillar.

07:08.360 --> 07:11.640
Man, 50 years old or older,
speaks in a mobile.

07:11.720 --> 07:13.520
Waiting.

07:15.560 --> 07:20.080
He's moving into the square.
Grey clothes, dark waistcoat.

07:20.160 --> 07:24.320
Chequered dark headgear. White top.

07:24.400 --> 07:28.320
-3-2-Echo, 3-2-Alpha.
-Is he wearing a suicide vest?

07:28.400 --> 07:33.080
3-2-Echo reading you:
It's difficult to confirm.

07:33.160 --> 07:37.160
He's wearing loose garments.
I only see him from the side.

07:37.240 --> 07:41.480
-Do you see him?
-He's moving to the south-east.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.680
He's stopping by a yellow vehicle.

07:49.320 --> 07:52.840
-3-2-Delta ought to see him now.
-Copy. Out.

07:52.920 --> 07:57.040
-3-2-Delta and 3-2-Alpha.
-3-2-Delta reading you.

07:57.120 --> 08:01.120
Can you see the one in question?

08:01.200 --> 08:04.400
-Eyes on. Over.
-Copy. Out.

08:05.840 --> 08:10.320
9-8, update us on the situation.
Is he wearing a suicide vest?

08:10.400 --> 08:12.760
Can you see a vest?

08:16.280 --> 08:18.720
-Erling?
-Situation report?

08:18.800 --> 08:23.480
Is he wearing a suicide vest?
He's moving towards the hospital.

08:30.480 --> 08:33.039
He's not a threat.

08:33.120 --> 08:37.159
9-8, no threat.
I repeat, no threat.

08:38.720 --> 08:40.320
It was nothing.

08:48.880 --> 08:52.120
He should be
happy we're not American.

08:52.200 --> 08:56.520
Then he would've been
dead as a dodo.

08:56.600 --> 08:58.480
How could you tell?

08:58.560 --> 09:03.280
He rolled up his sleeves.
No visible detonators or cables.

09:03.360 --> 09:06.080
I wouldn't have seen it that fast.

09:07.320 --> 09:12.120
-Did you like the food yesterday?
-Speaking of dodo?

09:12.200 --> 09:15.640
-Yours or the chef's?
-Mine.

09:17.320 --> 09:21.400
Why are you even here?
You should be running a restaurant.

09:35.280 --> 09:40.720
Two o'clock. Boy in dark green.
South-eastern corner of the square.

09:40.800 --> 09:42.360
Really?

09:42.440 --> 09:47.240
9-8, we've spotted a threat
in the square. A boy in green.

09:47.320 --> 09:51.800
-3-2-Charlie, this is 3-2-Alpha.
-3-2-Charlie reading you.

09:51.880 --> 09:55.640
Can you confirm that the boy
is wearing a black waistcoat?

09:55.720 --> 09:59.440
-Affirmative. Over.
-I have visual.

09:59.520 --> 10:03.080
It looks as if he's
on his way to the hospital.

10:03.160 --> 10:04.640
We see him. Over.

10:04.720 --> 10:08.480
-Have you got him, Johansen?
-He's behind the car.

10:08.560 --> 10:13.400
3-2-Charlie and 3-2-Alpha,
is the boy wearing suicide vest?

10:37.320 --> 10:40.640
9-8. Suicide bomber
killed on the square.

10:40.720 --> 10:42.280
Copy.

10:54.480 --> 10:57.320
9-8, pull the cordon out farther.

12:31.720 --> 12:34.040
Get back.
Get back.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.600
-Yunes!
-Stop.

12:42.680 --> 12:45.320
Stop.

13:17.160 --> 13:21.080
Mum! Mum!

13:31.080 --> 13:34.400
-3-Alpha, 3-2-Fox.
-3-Alpha responding.

13:34.480 --> 13:38.920
The vest is disarmed.
Ready to withdraw.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.560
Withdraw. Out.

14:29.920 --> 14:31.760
Yunes!

14:32.920 --> 14:35.000
You stay here!

14:54.280 --> 14:58.480
Come here!

15:09.400 --> 15:12.920
I don't think we'll
be seeing her again.

15:21.120 --> 15:25.800
ANP are on their way.
They'll collect the boy. We'll load up.

15:25.880 --> 15:28.560
Erling, are you alright?

17:30.880 --> 17:34.200
-What's in that parcel?
-What this is?

17:34.280 --> 17:36.320
Are you curious?

17:37.520 --> 17:39.400
Who do you think it's for?

17:40.960 --> 17:42.720
Me.

17:48.840 --> 17:52.520
-What do you think it is?
-I don't know.

17:52.600 --> 17:57.200
Alright, now I'll find out
what's inside there.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.880
-A...
-A?

17:59.960 --> 18:05.560
-It's a kite!
-That's right.

18:05.640 --> 18:08.760
-Do you remember how to do it?
-Through here.

18:08.840 --> 18:12.040
Tighten this one.
No, not there.

18:12.120 --> 18:14.720
Oh, that one.

18:14.800 --> 18:17.200
Around that one.

18:19.760 --> 18:22.520
Perfect! No problem!

18:26.480 --> 18:29.520
Let's move away from the car.

18:29.600 --> 18:34.960
You need a longer line,
and you need to keep it taut.

18:35.040 --> 18:36.680
-Ready?
-Yes.

18:36.760 --> 18:40.000
One, two, three.

18:42.040 --> 18:44.520
Hey, look at it go!

18:47.920 --> 18:49.960
Beautiful!

18:51.440 --> 18:53.800
Run, run, run!

18:55.200 --> 18:57.360
That's it!

19:14.080 --> 19:18.800
-How is it going down there?
-With me or the country?

19:18.880 --> 19:21.440
Let's start with the country.

19:23.480 --> 19:28.360
A bit better,
but far from a Western democracy.

19:28.440 --> 19:30.240
That's true.

19:32.680 --> 19:35.200
How are you?

19:36.520 --> 19:40.600
I have missed you. A lot.

19:43.920 --> 19:46.800
You smell so nice.

19:46.880 --> 19:50.480
That smell can't be
found in Afghanistan.

19:50.560 --> 19:56.920
-I've taught Rikard to change tires.
-On the car?

19:57.000 --> 20:01.480
-Are you kidding? By himself?
-Not yet, but soon.

20:03.760 --> 20:08.680
-Do you know how long you'll stay?
-A couple of months.

20:09.880 --> 20:15.280
Long enough so that we'll
miss you when you leave again.

20:15.360 --> 20:19.480
You know,
the event at the Concert Hall.

20:23.080 --> 20:28.360
-Could you maybe...?
-Would you like me to come?

20:28.440 --> 20:34.840
-Okay. What are we listening to?
-Mahler's fifth symphony.

20:34.920 --> 20:38.480
I'm so lucky.
I love Gustav Mahler.

20:38.560 --> 20:40.520
Daddy!

20:50.480 --> 20:52.560
What happened?

20:53.640 --> 20:55.640
Are you alright?

20:58.080 --> 21:02.080
-Did they beat you up?
-They wanted the kite.

21:02.160 --> 21:04.360
-Where is it?
-Over there.

21:04.440 --> 21:08.560
-What happened? Are you hurt?
-They wanted the kite.

21:09.680 --> 21:12.760
-They wanted the kite.
-Are you okay?

21:14.120 --> 21:17.760
-I told them that you'll shoot them.
-What?

21:17.840 --> 21:20.080
-What?
-I said that you'll shoot them.

21:20.160 --> 21:25.680
-You can't say that.
-What if they tried to shoot me?

21:25.760 --> 21:29.960
We're on a football field.
No one is shooting anyone here.

21:30.040 --> 21:34.560
-Would you shoot in Afghanistan?
-Not for a kite.

21:36.840 --> 21:39.760
-For something else?
-No.

21:40.960 --> 21:44.440
-Will you catch it?
-Yes.

22:25.760 --> 22:27.720
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

22:27.800 --> 22:31.160
-Did you have a nice evening?
-Are there any news?

22:31.240 --> 22:35.280
There's been a landslide in Cambodia.
1000 people dead.

22:35.360 --> 22:40.200
Climate talks in Japan, possible change
of government in Mongolia.

22:40.280 --> 22:43.040
A fishing boat
is missing in Honningsvåg.

22:43.120 --> 22:46.600
You've got a meeting
with "Oil for development".

22:46.680 --> 22:51.120
Rolf Inherad is here.
The minister is delayed.

22:51.200 --> 22:54.360
-Kristoffer is waiting.
-Did you read up on Inherad?

22:54.440 --> 22:57.040
Yes, I read up on him last night.

22:57.120 --> 23:01.240
Rolf Inherad is one of the most
influential men in the world.

23:01.320 --> 23:04.120
There you go.
You didn't know that yesterday.

23:04.200 --> 23:08.040
Now he works for NORAD's
"Oil for development" in Afghanistan.

23:08.120 --> 23:12.040
He's trying to introduce
Norwegian oil legislation,

23:12.120 --> 23:16.440
so the values can stay
with the Afghan people.

23:16.520 --> 23:20.360
-Education?
-Inherad is a geologist.

23:20.440 --> 23:23.160
He could've made
a fortune in the oil industry.

23:23.240 --> 23:27.320
But instead he chose politics.
He's narrow and specific.

23:27.400 --> 23:30.680
Conflict-ridden areas
with hidden wealth.

23:30.760 --> 23:35.000
Like diamonds in Botswana.
Mining in the Amazon.

23:35.080 --> 23:39.480
Oil in East Timor.
Minerals in Kosovo.

23:39.560 --> 23:43.680
You've used him a couple of times
at peace talks.

23:43.760 --> 23:48.960
Yes, he solves things. I don't know how,
but NORAD's lucky to have him.

23:49.040 --> 23:55.280
Great. You're a quick learner.
Could you get some coffee?

23:55.360 --> 23:57.880
Morning. Is Inherad already here?

23:57.960 --> 24:01.400
Mother Teresa, Mandela
and Gorbachev are all here.

24:01.480 --> 24:04.640
-Speaking of the devil.
-Hi.

24:04.720 --> 24:09.160
-Good morning! Ready?
-He's waiting.

24:09.240 --> 24:13.520
Do we know where he's at
with the agreement?

24:13.600 --> 24:19.520
If I know him, which I do,
he's got far.

24:22.680 --> 24:24.800
Rolf.

24:25.840 --> 24:31.640
If China overbids for the Afghan oil,
the whole agreement will go to pot.

24:31.720 --> 24:35.720
-All right. And?
-Are you meeting the Chinese later?

24:35.800 --> 24:39.400
-Yes.
-Yes.

24:39.480 --> 24:42.640
The Chinese Minister
of Energy is in Oslo.

24:42.720 --> 24:45.240
You can put pressure on them.

24:45.320 --> 24:50.320
So I should ask the Chinese to cancel
an oil agreement in Afghanistan?

24:50.400 --> 24:53.280
-You can try.
-We're trying to reach

24:53.360 --> 24:57.680
a bilateral trade agreement,
without EFTA and EEA. All alone.

24:57.760 --> 25:02.240
Our export potential is at NOK 30 billion.
So I can't ask China

25:02.320 --> 25:08.760
to cancel a private oil agreement
in Afghanistan and ask for 30 billion.

25:08.840 --> 25:11.000
-Do you know what I find hard?
-No.

25:12.800 --> 25:16.240
Seeing kids dying
of pleurisy and pneumonia

25:16.320 --> 25:19.480
because they lack fuel for heating.

25:21.360 --> 25:23.720
Why can't you convince the Afghans

25:23.800 --> 25:27.720
that "Oil for development"
is the right path?

25:27.800 --> 25:31.040
I've said it before. The landowner.

25:31.120 --> 25:35.000
Sharif Zamani.
He wants to make money.

25:35.080 --> 25:39.600
His uncle and advisor
is in favour of our oil agreement.

25:39.680 --> 25:43.480
So are the Minister of Energy,
the governor and the Prime Minister.

25:43.560 --> 25:46.320
He's the problem.

25:46.400 --> 25:48.560
And the Taliban?

25:49.760 --> 25:54.240
-The Taliban is the Taliban.
-What do they say?

25:54.320 --> 25:59.280
That the land belongs to the
opium farmers, who want to diversify.

26:02.160 --> 26:07.520
-But a process is in motion.
-Locally or nationally?

26:07.600 --> 26:14.000
We need local support, but now China
is a greater challenge than Taliban.

26:18.480 --> 26:22.960
I'm sorry that I
can't help you with China.

26:23.040 --> 26:27.760
No. Everyone's scared,
and nothing happens.

26:27.840 --> 26:33.520
Let me think about it. Anyhow,
I'll see you at tonight's concert, right?

26:33.600 --> 26:37.360
-Let me think about it.
-Always a pleasure.

26:39.120 --> 26:41.480
-See you later.
-Yes.

26:47.440 --> 26:52.040
-Is he cheeky, or am I getting old?
-You've always been old.

26:52.120 --> 26:56.040
-What are you thinking?
-That Rolf's right.

26:56.120 --> 27:02.120
If we want peace in Afghanistan,
we can't be afraid of stepping on toes.

27:12.000 --> 27:16.000
Hi, dad. Are you home? Dad?

27:50.320 --> 27:52.480
Hi!

27:55.120 --> 27:57.720
Come here.

27:59.960 --> 28:01.520
Hi.

28:24.600 --> 28:27.320
-Hi, dad.
-Hi.

28:28.840 --> 28:33.640
-It's good to see you.
-You phoned.

28:33.720 --> 28:38.880
-Do you want coffee?
-No, did Johanne say I was back?

28:45.360 --> 28:47.360
I'm glad you're alive.

28:48.680 --> 28:52.240
I don't understand
your business down there.

28:52.320 --> 28:58.080
We've discussed this before. Not
everyone can be as neutral as Sweden.

28:58.160 --> 29:02.600
I just thought you were free
and independent.

29:02.680 --> 29:08.360
-Instead of acting for the Americans.
-Two million German soldiers

29:08.440 --> 29:11.880
travelled through neutral Sweden.
Was that noble?

29:11.960 --> 29:15.400
That's one of your old arguments.

29:15.480 --> 29:19.880
It must be a good one then,
since it's used repeatedly.

29:25.400 --> 29:30.360
Will you come to
the medal ceremony tomorrow?

29:30.440 --> 29:34.840
-Erling, you don't want me there.
-I do. That's why I'm asking.

29:34.920 --> 29:39.760
-Is it important to you?
-Yes, and to Rikard.

29:44.080 --> 29:47.960
Of course. Of course, I'll be there.

29:48.040 --> 29:50.520
I promise. Listen...

29:51.640 --> 29:53.600
Erling.

29:58.480 --> 30:00.560
Have you got anything?

30:29.800 --> 30:33.680
Nice suit.
You ought to wear it more often.

30:33.760 --> 30:37.560
Nice dress.
You ought to only wear it at home.

30:37.640 --> 30:40.480
-Coat check?
-Later. Are you in control?

30:40.560 --> 30:44.400
Yes, full house. 200 are our guests.
Do you want a drink?

30:44.480 --> 30:47.360
-Is it free?
-It's on the state.

30:53.080 --> 30:58.160
-When's your boss arriving?
-In 3 minutes. And the Chinese in 7.

30:58.240 --> 31:01.440
Then we've got
all the time in the world.

31:03.960 --> 31:09.160
-Thank you for last night.
-What have you done today?

31:09.240 --> 31:12.320
-I went to see dad.
-Was he OK?

31:13.440 --> 31:17.560
Your boss isn't arriving in three,
he's arriving now.

31:19.040 --> 31:23.960
Audi A8. 4.2 litre. TDI.

31:24.040 --> 31:28.160
He parked it roughly 42 seconds ago.

31:28.240 --> 31:32.320
Do you want to count down?
Five, four... Are we there?

31:32.400 --> 31:36.320
-Three...
-You've got to be kidding me.

31:38.040 --> 31:39.480
-Hi.
-Hi.

31:39.560 --> 31:43.040
-Have you met my husband, Erling?
-No. Johan.

31:43.120 --> 31:46.400
I've heard a lot about you.
Are you on leave?

31:46.480 --> 31:49.840
-Charlotte. Kristoffer.
-Hi.

31:49.920 --> 31:54.960
It's good that you also get a break.
Thank you so much for your efforts.

31:55.040 --> 31:58.280
-Are the Chinese here?
-A few minutes away.

31:58.360 --> 32:01.760
-The Minister of Energy is prompt.
-He's addressed as

32:01.840 --> 32:05.720
State Councillor
of Land and Resources.

32:05.800 --> 32:09.080
I'll have to try and remember.

32:09.160 --> 32:13.080
What the...!
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

32:13.160 --> 32:16.280
-I can't believe it.
-Who is it?

32:16.360 --> 32:19.040
We've got a situation on our hands.

32:19.120 --> 32:23.560
An unofficial Chinese with the chair
of the Nobel Committee. An Chan.

32:23.640 --> 32:28.520
An activist and a critic
of the regime.

32:28.600 --> 32:32.600
Nora is on our guest list. Plus one.
I didn't know she'd bring Chan.

32:32.680 --> 32:35.080
She probably wants him to meet you.

32:35.160 --> 32:40.720
Then a trade agreement worth
30 billion goes to pot. Any solutions?

32:40.800 --> 32:44.120
I saw journalists outside.
I'll try and detain them.

32:44.200 --> 32:49.560
-Are you versed in classical music?
-Yes, I've studied piano and viola.

32:49.640 --> 32:53.520
Wonderful. Go and mingle with
the chair of the Nobel Committee.

32:53.600 --> 32:56.720
-When is the Minister arriving?
-Now.

32:56.800 --> 33:02.640
Let's smile and pretend all's well.
If he notices Chan, we need a plan B.

33:27.280 --> 33:28.960
-Hi, Hektor.
-Hi.

33:29.040 --> 33:32.040
-Can I steal you for a second?
-Yes, you may.

33:32.120 --> 33:34.120
-Thanks.
-What's happening?

33:34.200 --> 33:36.800
Would you like to meet
China's Minister of Energy?

33:36.880 --> 33:41.040
-Yes, what should we to talk about?
-Smalltalk.

34:01.480 --> 34:04.200
-Perfect timing, Nora!
-Okay?

34:04.280 --> 34:08.639
You're ruining the agreement
of the century. Where are your seats?

34:08.719 --> 34:12.679
-In the stalls.
-Charlotte, get them balcony seats.

34:12.760 --> 34:14.360
You want us to move?

34:22.960 --> 34:25.719
-The balcony. Now, Nora.
-Johanne?

35:26.360 --> 35:32.480
I'm not quite sure what happened
just now, but it was impressive.

35:32.560 --> 35:37.480
-Are you alright?
-Yes. Are you ready for the concert?

35:37.560 --> 35:42.000
I've never been more ready.
Gustav Mahler.

35:42.080 --> 35:44.120
I'll just leave my coat.

35:55.720 --> 35:58.520
-Hi, Erling!
-Hi!

35:58.600 --> 36:00.600
-Erling Riiser.
-Agnes.

36:00.680 --> 36:05.440
-How's the threat level?
-Like the security. Dull.

36:05.520 --> 36:09.120
-Are you a fan of Mahler?
-I prefer contemporary music.

36:09.200 --> 36:12.160
-Shakira?
-Johnny Cash.

36:12.240 --> 36:14.280
-See you later!
-See you.

36:23.520 --> 36:27.400
JPEL TARGET SHARIF ZAMANI IS IN OSLO.
WASIMA IS IN HIDING AT P-HOTEL.

36:34.680 --> 36:39.880
JPEL TARGET SHARIF ZAMANI IS IN OSLO.
WASIMA IS IN HIDING AT P-HOTEL.

36:44.480 --> 36:46.400
ARMED FORCES' SPECIAL COMMAND
EKEBERG, PRIVATE

36:53.360 --> 36:58.280
Hi, it's Erling. I've just received
a text from you. What's that about?

36:58.360 --> 37:01.800
Can you call me back
when you get this message?

37:36.200 --> 37:38.760
Ekeberg, please call me.

37:38.840 --> 37:41.880
Just call me when
you get this message.

39:44.560 --> 39:46.920
Let me go!

39:59.440 --> 40:02.080
You whore!

40:06.520 --> 40:08.400
No, don't!

40:11.200 --> 40:15.600
I'll teach you to run away
from your husband.

41:53.520 --> 41:56.360
I'll see you outside.

41:57.920 --> 42:00.080
Excuse me. Thank you.

42:18.840 --> 42:22.360
There you are.
That went well.

42:24.440 --> 42:27.040
-Is everything OK?
-Yes, and you?

42:27.120 --> 42:29.960
-Never felt better.
-Ready for dinner?

42:30.040 --> 42:34.080
Yes, are you coming?
Do you want to go home?

42:34.160 --> 42:39.400
You saved a 30 billion deal
with that vase story. You're dismissed.

42:39.480 --> 42:42.240
-Thank you.
-I'll see you later.

43:24.760 --> 43:26.720
