05:02.719 --> 05:05.848
Barcelona was a really difficult moment

05:05.889 --> 05:10.520

between the club and Johan Cruyff.

I follow a legend.

05:14.981 --> 05:16.153

Johan Cruyff was the most

There were supposed to be elections in 1998.

The board of directors sacked Cruyff

'It's only got one way to go,

Well, of course you've given me a lovely
controversial question to begin with.

I've come here because I'rn sure that
there's a great job to do here in football.

07:55.809 --> 07:59.985
Many people have given impressions
about the state of the club here.

08:00.021 --> 08:02.069
I personally wouldn't say that they're true.

08:02.107 --> 08:04.610
This is a club which will allow me

08:04.651 --> 08:06.824

08:41.145 --> 08:42.818

08:42.856 --> 08:44.699
Well, all we want really, it's very simple

08:44.733 --> 08:47.612
all we eat is tea and toast and jam.

08:49.612 --> 08:53.992
When you take over /t's because something
has fa//ed to happen at the club.

08:55.076 --> 08:57.545
Now, they play off two strikers.

08:57.579 --> 09:02.085
That's their four, and that's their four,
the crosses are their four.

09:02.459 --> 09:04.211

09:25.690 --> 09:26.907

and the strength of the club

09:57.138 --> 10:01.268

so we worked on that very hard.

10:01.309 --> 10:04.279
If there-'s half of the strikers on you,
accept it as such and knock it in.

10:05.230 --> 10:07.699
Confidence and composure,
just a touch of Jimmy Greaves.

10:07.732 --> 10:09.530
He was certainly a man of his time.

10:09.567 --> 10:12.696
L\/lost managers will develop the first team

10:13.404 --> 10:15.156

10:15.198 --> 10:17.872

an enormous satisfaction

10:17.909 --> 10:21.379

into international players.

'We need bums on seats, Bobby.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.480

he make me feel so calm, so relaxed.

14:25.031 --> 14:30.709
He told me, 'Enjoy yourself,

He was fast, intelligent.
He could do absolutely everything.

14:48.262 --> 14:50.060
JOAN:
Barcelona won 5-2.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.276
/t was a br////ant start
for Sir Bobby in Barcelona.

14:59.774 --> 15:01.447
Ronaldo is special.

15:02.068 --> 15:04.821
He has the physique of a
middleweight boxer.

15:04.821 --> 15:09.292
You know, good shoulders, good biceps,
good body, fantastic legs.

15:09.325 --> 15:13.296
And he is one of the quickest players
I've ever seen with the ball.

15:15.665 --> 15:19.135

against Compostela.

15:19.293 --> 15:20.419
It was unbelievable!

15:27.427 --> 15:30.180
RONALDO:
The goa/ /tse/f was amazing.

15:34.225 --> 15:40.858
But everyone who watched that goal
is surprised about Bobby Robson's reaction.

15:45.069 --> 15:47.948
'Oh, my God. Unbelievable what he did.'

15:48.489 --> 15:49.991
You know, the hands on the head.

15:50.032 --> 15:52.330
'This is unbelievable, this is not real.'

16:00.293 --> 16:02.295
'Pass the ba//. ' He don't pass the ba//.

And after score a goal, I said,
'Well done, don't pass the ball.'

16:05.590 --> 16:07.558
So that is perfect.

16:09.510 --> 16:13.105
RONALDO: That goal is
one of the best memories / have.

16:14.932 --> 16:18.061
Bobby's reaction for sure
is part of the goal.

16:38.664 --> 16:43.295
Bobby Robson, from the first day,
we had a meeting in one hotel

16:43.336 --> 16:48.217

who was his assistant.

16:48.257 --> 16:50.180

Yesterday was the first time we didn't shoot

After the period in Barcelona,

to go with him to play with Newcastle.

And one of my dreams

'It is not possible

it's a beautiful place.

01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:38.005

Bye bye.

REPORTER: Does your wife Elsie
approve of your continual work/ng

01:17:19.343 --> 01:17:21.016
at this most demanding /eve/?

01:17:22.054 --> 01:17:23.727
BOBBY: Off the record,
she thinks /'m bloody stupid.

01:17:23.764 --> 01:17:25.186
She thinks /'m crazy.

01:17:28.811 --> 01:17:31.985
ELSIE: He would always talk to anybody
about football, always.

01:17:31.981 --> 01:17:33.824
Did you ever see Bobby Moore play?

01:17:33.858 --> 01:17:35.826
When he was in position,
he always could plant it

01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:37.703
and he could always drop into the hole.

01:17:38.154 --> 01:17:41.749
Nothing was as urgent as just speaking
to someone about the game.

01:17:41.782 --> 01:17:44.331
And he's a great penalty taker, you know?
'Cause he knows...

01:17:44.952 --> 01:17:47.580
He always makes up his mind what he's
gonna do and never deviates from it.

01:17:47.621 --> 01:17:48.998
That was the urgency.

01:17:50.499 --> 01:17:53.423
If you hit that well,
you'll be out in the next parish, yeah.

01:17:54.128 --> 01:17:56.677
BOBBY: My wife keeps say/ng to me,
'You must take time for you/'se/ii '

01:17:56.714 --> 01:17:58.136
A/ex Ferguson said that to me.

01:17:58.841 --> 01:18:02.220
What, three is the right club?
For me.

01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:08.356
'Take time for you/'se/Ji
Take time to smell the roses. '

01:18:10.853 --> 01:18:16.781
I hope you got that.
I hope you got that! By Christ!

01:18:18.319 --> 01:18:20.492
ELSIE:
We had this kind of agreement

01:18:20.529 --> 01:18:24.375
that when he was at home,
we didn't ta/k a /ot about football.

01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:30.916
He didn't talk to me intimately
about those thoughts

01:18:30.956 --> 01:18:32.674
that were going round in his head.

01:18:35.753 --> 01:18:37.050
MARK:
Dad was immersed in it.

01:18:38.047 --> 01:18:40.049
We don't see him much, if at a//.

01:18:41.008 --> 01:18:42.635
And we were al/ passionate about football

01:18:42.676 --> 01:18:44.770
but we never had the chance to ta/k.

01:18:45.679 --> 01:18:47.852
He didn't want to be separated,
but he was.

01:18:51.352 --> 01:18:52.649
That was a shame

01:18:54.104 --> 01:18:56.573
because lots of people say to /779,
you know

01:18:56.607 --> 01:18:59.736
'What was it like talking to your dad
about certain players or matche-s?'

01:18:59.777 --> 01:19:02.701
And I say, 'Well, I never did,
literally never did.'

01:19:05.741 --> 01:19:08.790
BOBBY: Are there any times
when / don't //'ke Bobby Robson?

01:19:11.956 --> 01:19:14.004
/ spent maybe too much time
at the club

01:19:14.041 --> 01:19:15.543
when / should have been home
e bit earlier.

01:19:17.002 --> 01:19:20.256
/ fee/ that / have been removed

CROWD ROARS

/z' was the sem/-Hna/ of the UEFA Cup.

We /ost and e depression
came over the club.

01:19:56.166 --> 01:19:58.385
We al/ took it bad/y
and the fans took it bad/y.

01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:01.297
There? Other side? OK.

01:20:01.338 --> 01:20:04.012
ALAN:
/t was becoming a very d/fHcu/t per/od.

01:20:04.049 --> 01:20:06.302
There were young players
who had issues.

01:20:06.343 --> 01:20:09.142
You won't get much out of me,
it's a wasted question.

01:20:09.179 --> 01:20:11.477
REPORTER 1: Well, I just think
we look silly if we don't ask it.

01:20:11.515 --> 01:20:14.018
You can, but it's a wasted question.
- OK, fine.

01:20:14.059 --> 01:20:16.403
REPORTER 2: Can you clear up all the talk
of a training ground bust-up?

01:20:16.437 --> 01:20:17.905
BOBBY:
It's a storm in a teacup.

01:20:17.938 --> 01:20:19.565
No, I never say I'd settle for nil-nil.

01:20:19.606 --> 01:20:21.608
When did I say I'd settle for nil-nil?

01:20:21.650 --> 01:20:23.744
I'rn not prepared to comment
about the incident.

01:20:23.777 --> 01:20:26.326
The incident is closed,
it's been dealt with.

01:20:26.363 --> 01:20:28.081
We will speak to him today,
obviously, firmly.

01:20:28.115 --> 01:20:32.040
And we don't have a single second
of problems.

01:20:35.789 --> 01:20:38.668
ALAN:
Players were on so much money

01:20:39.626 --> 01:20:42.846
and not showing him
and the football club respect

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:45.133
which he found very d/fHcu/t.

01:20:47.926 --> 01:20:50.475
FREDDY: Many times players
were out of order with him.

01:20:50.512 --> 01:20:52.640
He said, 'No, we '// give
them another chance. '

01:20:53.223 --> 01:20:55.942
He cou/d never find the dark side
of anybody.

01:20:55.976 --> 01:20:57.944
How's my hair, alright?

01:20:57.978 --> 01:20:59.980
Alright? Just come off
the training ground. OK?

01:21:01.315 --> 01:21:04.068
First team players approached
Freddy Shepherd

01:21:04.109 --> 01:21:06.282
and said, 'You're going
to have to do something.

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:09.494
There's problems in the dressing room,
problems with the players.'

01:21:09.531 --> 01:21:11.625
But Bobby still felt he could do it.

01:21:11.658 --> 01:21:12.659
REPORTER:
Good luck, Sir Bobby.

01:21:12.659 --> 01:21:13.831
Thank you.

REPORTER 1: Newcastle Un/ted
are tonight stepping up their Search

01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:33.931
for a new manager.

01:21:33.972 --> 01:21:36.566
REPORTER 2: Newcastle Un/ted manager,
Sir Bobby Robson, is sacked.

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:39.729
REPORTER 1: closing the book on one
of football's greatest characters.

01:21:41.146 --> 01:21:43.444
What I've come out for is to show
you a bit of courtesy.

01:21:43.482 --> 01:21:45.359
Because you could stay here
for seven hours

01:21:45.401 --> 01:21:46.698
and I don't want you to do that.

01:21:46.735 --> 01:21:48.578
You've got a home and a family
to go to I should think

01:21:48.612 --> 01:21:49.784
and I would suggest
that you do that.

01:21:52.324 --> 01:21:53.746
FREDDY:
/z' was //ke shooting Bambi.

01:21:55.577 --> 01:21:58.296
But as chairman of the club,
/ had to do it.

01:22:00.833 --> 01:22:04.554
I don't think there was a person
in this world who could understand it.

01:22:05.421 --> 01:22:06.764
ALEX:
/ cou/drl'z' be//eve it.

01:22:09.299 --> 01:22:11.301
JOHN:
/ was bas/ca//y in favour.

01:22:11.844 --> 01:22:14.518
If you cannot pull
your dressing room together

01:22:14.555 --> 01:22:16.273
then you've got a problem

01:22:16.306 --> 01:22:19.310
and management get paid
for making these decisions.

01:22:20.853 --> 01:22:24.232
/t actually didn't start from us,
it started with the players.

01:22:25.232 --> 01:22:26.905
They were cruel in many, many ways.

01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:31.159
They were responsible
for getting Bobby the sack.

01:22:33.282 --> 01:22:34.909
ALEX:
/t was a club of confusion.

01:22:36.118 --> 01:22:37.244
They should have been say/ng

01:22:37.286 --> 01:22:41.132
'Bobby, I want you to bring the man
who is gonna replace you

01:22:41.165 --> 01:22:45.295
to continue with someone who believes
in what you've done here

01:22:45.335 --> 01:22:46.803
and make it an institution.

01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:50.303
JOHN: DeHnite/y, we wanted
him to go upstairs

01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:55.016
and to be an ambassador for the club
and to do what he's good at.

01:22:55.053 --> 01:22:58.683
That was the difference of opinion
between Freddy and Bobby at the time.

01:23:01.393 --> 01:23:04.317
ALAN:
When you /ook at Newcastle Un/ted now

01:23:04.354 --> 01:23:06.027
and over the years once he had left

01:23:07.024 --> 01:23:09.447
you certainly rea//se
what an incredible job he had done.

01:23:10.819 --> 01:23:12.742
I think it was a hasty decision, yeah.

01:23:14.656 --> 01:23:16.954
I've had five fabulous years
here with everybody.

01:23:18.243 --> 01:23:20.712
BOBBY:
And / wil/ be their biggest fan after this.

Not been easy for me today,

01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:24.838
and I have to get on with my life.

01:23:26.335 --> 01:23:29.464
He was very heartbroken
when he was guillotined.

01:23:31.798 --> 01:23:35.598
He didn't recover
from that very quickly, at all.

01:23:35.636 --> 01:23:37.684
REPORTER: Will you be going on to
manage another olub in the future?

Totally obsessed with football.

01:24:26.687 --> 01:24:27.984

I'd have been like that,
wheelin' a barrow.

01:24:33.694 --> 01:24:36.823
I guarantee if you named a player,
any player in the world

01:24:36.863 --> 01:24:40.117
he would know what he had for breakfast,
what number his house was

01:24:40.158 --> 01:24:43.958
what country he comes from,
how old he is, the whole lot.

01:24:43.996 --> 01:24:45.339
He was obsessed.

01:24:49.126 --> 01:24:51.970

Where are you? Can I come and see you?'

and I had to say, 'Has Sir Bobby sent you?'

01:25:20.324 --> 01:25:23.669
'Yeah.' Tell him I'rn OK today.
I don't know about tomorrow.

01:29:25.944 --> 01:29:29.744
This, ladies and gentleman,
is Fabio's next team.

01:29:33.952 --> 01:29:37.798
I said I would do it for my first year,
but it looks as though I'rn here to stay.

01:29:40.750 --> 01:29:42.844
I've got longer than
a football league manager.

01:29:42.919 --> 01:29:44.967
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

01:29:49.676 --> 01:29:53.476
/t gives me great pleasure
to ofHc/a//y declare

01:29:53.513 --> 01:29:57.143
the S/r Bobby Hobson Cancer
Trials Research Centre

01:29:57.183 --> 01:29:59.356
wel/ and tru/y opened.

01:29:59.603 --> 01:30:01.651
APPLAUSE

01:30:03.857 --> 01:30:07.657
ALAN: He was always go/ng
to do something specia/

01:30:09.529 --> 01:30:11.702
and /ee ve something special behind.

01:30:12.824 --> 01:30:14.622
Follow the guys in the white coats!

01:30:18.455 --> 01:30:21.334
HUW: Healthcare, /z"s very expensive,
you need money

01:30:22.584 --> 01:30:26.885
and he was the primary mover in raising
that money for the Foundation.

01:30:28.340 --> 01:30:31.184
/z"s one of the foremost un/ts
now in Europe.

01:30:34.179 --> 01:30:35.522
BOBBY:
Cancer doesn't discriminate.

01:30:37.057 --> 01:30:38.684
No one is immune from it.

01:30:39.684 --> 01:30:42.563
Whilst I will be remembered
because of my life through football

01:30:44.189 --> 01:30:47.284
the legacy that / would prefer
to be remembered by

01:30:47.317 --> 01:30:49.285
is the fact that / ra/sed some money

01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:55.042
which in time and in turn wil/ save //ves.

01:30:59.204 --> 01:31:04.301
CROWD CHEERS

01:31:14.886 --> 01:31:16.888
PAUL:
/t was a charity game

01:31:19.641 --> 01:31:21.894
and he was getting
pushed along in the wheelchair.

01:31:25.563 --> 01:31:28.407
All I could hear him say was,
'Where's Gazza? Where's Gazza?'

01:31:29.067 --> 01:31:31.820
I went, 'lt's me, Sir Bobby, it's Gazza.'

01:31:31.820 --> 01:31:33.072
And he looked up...

01:31:40.829 --> 01:31:42.376
He just said...

01:31:44.833 --> 01:31:46.210
'Play well.'

01:31:49.713 --> 01:31:53.343
That's all he said.
He said, 'Play well, Gazza.'

01:31:58.388 --> 01:32:00.231
ELSIE:
/ know he didn't want to die.

01:32:02.434 --> 01:32:04.903
/ know for a fact he did not want to die.

01:32:06.229 --> 01:32:08.357
Some people will accept death

01:32:09.357 --> 01:32:13.658
but he felt he was being robbed.

01:32:49.022 --> 01:32:50.990
BOBBY:
Yeah, I can hear you, Ian, yes.

01:32:54.736 --> 01:32:56.113
JOSE:
/ miss him.

01:32:57.614 --> 01:32:58.911
But / remember him.

01:33:03.119 --> 01:33:04.621
I can hear him perfectly actually.
- MAN: Can you?

01:33:04.662 --> 01:33:05.879
Perfectly.

01:33:06.456 --> 01:33:10.677
The most dramatic thing for me at the time
was to lose a football matoh.

01:33:14.380 --> 01:33:15.973
This isn't live, is it?

01:33:17.300 --> 01:33:21.100
He was saying, 'Be happy,
because around the corner

01:33:21.137 --> 01:33:22.309
the other guys were happy.'

01:33:22.347 --> 01:33:25.100
He was always trying to find a reason
to be happy

01:33:25.141 --> 01:33:26.484
even in the difficult moments.

01:33:26.518 --> 01:33:28.520
Jimmy, after what I've handled
over the last three days

01:33:28.561 --> 01:33:30.108
I can handle you.

01:33:33.274 --> 01:33:35.527
TERRY:
He always used to say to me

01:33:36.111 --> 01:33:37.237
Butcher. ..

01:33:38.530 --> 01:33:40.498
Whenever / pick you,
you never /et me down. '

01:33:41.658 --> 01:33:43.877
And if someone says that to you,
wow, it's just...

01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:46.880
You'd go through
hell and high water for them.

01:33:48.164 --> 01:33:50.166
You can always have a few days
in Majorca, Butch.

01:33:51.209 --> 01:33:53.382
I can always take you
to the Costa del Sol.

01:33:54.087 --> 01:33:57.808
I would put him alongside
Muhammad Ali in football words.

01:34:00.009 --> 01:34:05.140
He was more than a manager, more.
More than anything.

01:34:10.103 --> 01:34:13.152
JOAN GASPART:
Barcelona is more than a club.

01:34:13.189 --> 01:34:15.817
Bobby Robson was more than a coach.

01:34:20.947 --> 01:34:22.699
JOAN GASPART SPEAKS SPANISH

01:34:25.118 --> 01:34:29.168
RONALDO: We have so many people
that has /earnt a /ot from him.

01:34:30.498 --> 01:34:35.049
His legacy is still alive
and he gonna stay alive forever.

01:34:37.839 --> 01:34:40.388
BOBBY SPEAKS DUTCH
- CHEEBS

01:34:44.179 --> 01:34:48.810
PEP: To win titles in Holland,
in Porta/ga/, in Spain.

01:34:49.684 --> 01:34:52.813
To survive in different places
and have success...

01:34:53.646 --> 01:34:55.569
That is why Bobby is spec/a/.

01:35:00.153 --> 01:35:01.780
GARY:
/f you consider what he's done

01:35:02.739 --> 01:35:07.540
I would say the best
English manager of all time.

01:35:11.706 --> 01:35:15.461
ALEX: / remember one day /'m sitting
in my house and my phone goes.

01:35:16.461 --> 01:35:19.214
'Alex, it's Bobby here-.'
'Hi Bobby,' I said, 'where are you?'

01:35:19.255 --> 01:35:20.973
He says, 'I'm outside your door.'

01:35:23.635 --> 01:35:25.228
So he comes outside my door

01:35:25.220 --> 01:35:26.938
and I says,
'Well, you better come in!'

01:35:27.847 --> 01:35:29.645
I didn't like you Saturday,
but I like you tonight.

01:35:32.352 --> 01:35:34.821
He had that wonderfu/ nature about him.

01:35:34.854 --> 01:35:37.403
You always think, oh, he helped me
when / was a young coach.

01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:39.492
I don't forget that.

01:35:41.319 --> 01:35:43.071
INDISTINCT CHATTEH

01:35:43.112 --> 01:35:45.490
Eric, your right foot's gone
like your left!

01:35:48.743 --> 01:35:53.294
I remember him every day
and I tell stories about him.

01:35:55.583 --> 01:36:00.339
JOSE: We laugh with the stories,
we remember him in the right we y.

01:36:03.299 --> 01:36:04.892
A person only dies

01:36:08.054 --> 01:36:10.307
when the last person
that loves him dies.

01:36:18.731 --> 01:36:20.074
BOBBY:
/ tel/ you.

01:36:23.361 --> 01:36:24.829
/ tel/ you.

01:36:27.282 --> 01:36:29.159
/t was a //fe of pressure...

01:36:31.744 --> 01:36:33.121
A _great deal of tension...

01:36:34.664 --> 01:36:36.291
A great dee/ of emotion...

01:36:39.627 --> 01:36:42.176
But there was a/so
a great dee/ of excitement.

01:36:46.718 --> 01:36:48.265
You can't /ose that thrill

01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:50.847
'cause let me ask you this...

01:36:51.723 --> 01:36:54.772
How many people get that chance?

01:36:56.602 --> 01:36:58.104
The guy in the street?

01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:02.818
Or the fe//a you are gonna
sit next to on the train?

01:37:06.696 --> 01:37:08.369
Or the taxi dr/ver?

01:37:09.866 --> 01:37:11.664
Do they have that chance?

01:37:18.041 --> 01:37:19.418
You have that chance.
