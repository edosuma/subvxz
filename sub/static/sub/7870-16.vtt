09:59.348 --> 10:00.891
Trying to fix your broken brain.

10:00.975 --> 10:02.226
My brain's fine.

10:02.310 --> 10:05.187
In my dreams,
I'm an intermediate skier!

10:06.272 --> 10:08.357
♪♪

10:08.441 --> 10:10.109
(Maggie sucking pacifier)

10:10.192 --> 10:13.613
(sinister laughter)

10:13.696 --> 10:15.656
Ski patrol!
Everybody be cool!

10:15.740 --> 10:17.658
It's Death!
I recognize him

10:17.742 --> 10:19.785
from 40th birthday cards.

10:19.869 --> 10:21.370
(Death chuckling)

10:21.454 --> 10:23.331
Homie, this might be a clue.

10:23.414 --> 10:24.624
What's in that coffin

10:24.707 --> 10:26.959
could be behind your
nighttime oopsies.

10:27.043 --> 10:28.461
You wet the bed?!

10:28.544 --> 10:31.380
Oh... great!
Now Death knows!

10:32.840 --> 10:35.593
(whimpering)

10:35.676 --> 10:36.761
(screams)

10:36.844 --> 10:37.762
What do you see?

10:37.845 --> 10:39.764
Uh, nothing,
typical dream nonsense.

10:43.684 --> 10:44.852
(all screaming)

10:44.935 --> 10:46.062
Relax.

10:46.145 --> 10:48.230
Everyone knows
that if you die in a dream,

10:48.314 --> 10:49.440
you just wake up.

10:49.523 --> 10:50.733
(phone rings)

10:50.816 --> 10:52.485
<i>Oh, uh, actually,</i>

10:52.568 --> 10:56.447
<i>because I neglected to install</i>
<i>the latest Adobe Acrobat update,</i>

10:56.530 --> 10:59.742
<i>if you die in the dream,</i>
<i>you die in real life.</i>

10:59.825 --> 11:02.036
-(gasps)
<i>-Incidentally, I've also proven</i>

11:02.119 --> 11:05.581
<i>that Hell is real, and everyone</i>
<i>goes there. Frink out.</i>

11:05.665 --> 11:08.417
(all screaming)

11:12.505 --> 11:14.674
(screaming)

11:14.757 --> 11:16.884
Wait a minute, I can't die.

11:16.967 --> 11:18.761
(roaring)

11:18.844 --> 11:20.513
Mommy.

11:21.514 --> 11:22.515
(screaming resumes)

11:22.598 --> 11:23.599
Listen, everyone.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.726
We should fall asleep
in this dream.

11:25.810 --> 11:26.852
One minute at this level

11:26.936 --> 11:29.772
equals two hours one
dream level below.

11:29.855 --> 11:31.107
Wait, dreams have rules?

11:31.190 --> 11:32.858
Everything has rules, Bart.

11:32.942 --> 11:34.860
Not me, when I hit
the dance floor.

11:34.944 --> 11:37.154
(making goofy noises)

11:41.450 --> 11:43.494
Ooh-ooh-ooh!
Ah-ah-ah!

11:47.665 --> 11:49.208
(snoring)

11:53.546 --> 11:55.131
-(belches)
-Bart!

11:55.214 --> 11:57.967
Can the chatter
and fetch me a baloney sandwich.

11:58.050 --> 12:00.428
Why don't you
fetch it yourself, man.

12:01.429 --> 12:03.222
Bart's making faces!

12:03.305 --> 12:05.933
Shut up, you kids,
and bring me baloney.

12:06.016 --> 12:07.852
(grunting)

12:07.935 --> 12:10.146
Wait nicely.

12:10.229 --> 12:12.440
Simpson family?

12:14.567 --> 12:17.319
Now, I believe that to solve
Homer's problem,

12:17.403 --> 12:19.864
he must face what's
inside the coffin.

12:19.947 --> 12:23.033
Forget it, Doc. What if that's
my marriage in there?

12:23.117 --> 12:25.619
Marriage, shmarriage.
What's in the box, man?

12:27.288 --> 12:28.372
(yelling)

12:29.790 --> 12:32.293
See what your monkeyshines
have done, boy?

12:32.376 --> 12:34.837
Still smells better than
your gym socks, man.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.046
Why you little...

12:36.130 --> 12:39.717
I'll teach you to make fun
of my socks.

12:39.800 --> 12:42.219
Here, quick!
Everyone into my dream!

12:48.267 --> 12:50.269
(gasps)

12:50.352 --> 12:54.482
What brings thy merry band
to Stratford's plains?

12:54.565 --> 12:56.025
Forsooth, a myst'ry doth confound...

12:56.108 --> 12:57.818
In your dreams.

13:00.529 --> 13:02.323
We never do my thing.

13:06.535 --> 13:07.745
Ooh...

13:07.828 --> 13:08.913
Huh?

13:08.996 --> 13:10.998
(grunts, gasps)

13:11.081 --> 13:12.666
I know this dream.

13:14.418 --> 13:16.587
It's the land of my
innermost thoughts

13:16.670 --> 13:18.047
and fondest desires.

13:18.130 --> 13:19.965
At last we'll get
to the bottom of...

13:20.049 --> 13:21.592
WOMAN:
Welcome back, handsome.

13:23.844 --> 13:25.012
(nervous giggles)

13:25.095 --> 13:27.181
Uh, Marge,
this is my friend Keggy.

13:27.264 --> 13:29.433
Mmm...

13:29.517 --> 13:30.643
Oh...

13:59.171 --> 14:00.756
(doors ding)

14:04.093 --> 14:08.389
In this fantasy Kwik-E-Mart,
you get your change in bacon.

14:08.472 --> 14:09.473
Whoo-hoo!

14:14.395 --> 14:17.398
MOES: In this place mothers
are<i> for</i> drunk driving.

14:17.481 --> 14:19.817
ALL:
Chug! Chug! Chug!

14:19.900 --> 14:21.902
Hey Dad, if this is
your fantasy world,

14:21.986 --> 14:23.237
how come Flanders is here?

14:23.320 --> 14:24.655
Hi-diddly-ho, dream team!

14:24.738 --> 14:25.990
(screams)

14:26.073 --> 14:27.408
Where's my God now?

14:27.491 --> 14:30.160
-(laughing)
-Homie!

14:30.244 --> 14:32.413
We're here to find answers
to your problem.

14:32.496 --> 14:34.081
We know there's
a marriage in trouble,

14:34.164 --> 14:36.834
and it has something
to do with fish.

14:36.917 --> 14:38.419
Oh, lighten up, Marge.

14:38.502 --> 14:40.170
I take you
to the Disneyland of me,

14:40.254 --> 14:42.715
and you just want
to go to the lost and found.

14:42.798 --> 14:43.799
Well, guess what?

14:43.883 --> 14:46.093
We're staying
in this dream forever.

14:48.512 --> 14:50.347
(laughing)

14:50.431 --> 14:53.309
Whoo-hoo! (laughs)
Wheeee!

14:53.392 --> 14:55.936
I'm in me! (laughs)

14:56.020 --> 14:58.230
Oh, I love the down part!

14:58.314 --> 14:59.773
Here it comes! Whoo-hoo!

15:01.025 --> 15:03.027
(humming)

15:05.195 --> 15:08.699
Unplug these people,
Dr. Ker-dork-ian!

15:08.782 --> 15:11.160
Oh, you foolish man,
if I unhook them now,

15:11.243 --> 15:13.579
I won't know if this
is safe to use on chimps!

15:13.662 --> 15:15.039
All right, I'll do it myself.

15:15.122 --> 15:16.749
-Give me that, give me it!
-No!

15:16.832 --> 15:18.792
Oh, the largeness!

15:30.012 --> 15:31.639
(screaming)

15:41.231 --> 15:42.483
(shrieks) Quick!

15:42.566 --> 15:44.068
Gum up the gears with Moes.

15:48.572 --> 15:50.282
Hey, you know what's good for
cleaning Moe gunk

15:50.366 --> 15:51.408
out of your gears?

15:51.492 --> 15:52.910
White vinegar. Yeah.

15:52.993 --> 15:53.994
(screaming)

16:00.709 --> 16:02.836
(slow-motion grunting)

16:02.920 --> 16:05.756
(slow-motion)
Glayyyviiin!

16:07.967 --> 16:10.386
Uh, we're gonna be here
a long time.

16:13.889 --> 16:17.685
(slow-motion)
Oh, the maaaachiiine...

16:25.067 --> 16:27.069
(yelling)

16:29.947 --> 16:32.032
Oh, Death, you're a lifesaver.

16:39.748 --> 16:40.666
Thank you, Death.

16:40.749 --> 16:42.751
I am not...

16:42.835 --> 16:43.836
Death.

16:43.919 --> 16:45.879
-Mom?!
-KIDS: Gramma!

16:45.963 --> 16:47.756
Mona, you're alive?

16:47.840 --> 16:50.759
No, but I live on
in Homer's dreams.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.803
Just like my hair.

16:52.886 --> 16:55.931
That's Jennifer Aniston's hair
on <i>Friends.</i>

16:56.015 --> 16:59.768
Exactly like Chandler,
always criticizing.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.854
Now, I have something
to show you.

17:01.937 --> 17:05.357
Something that just might
help Homer wake up dry.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.944
HOMER: Wow!

17:09.028 --> 17:11.363
Roomy.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.616
(film projector whirring)

17:14.700 --> 17:16.785
While you boys are out
playing in the boat,

17:16.869 --> 17:19.079
I'll go to the store
and pick us up some dinner.

17:19.163 --> 17:21.290
No need.
With two Simpson men in the boat,

17:21.373 --> 17:24.126
we'll bring you back
a pile of fish.

17:24.209 --> 17:27.129
I'm in charge of the tackle box.

17:27.212 --> 17:29.715
What...?
(choking)

17:29.798 --> 17:31.884
(laughs)
And we're off.

17:31.967 --> 17:33.886
(choking)
Good-bye!

17:33.969 --> 17:37.097
(laughs) Man, Homer,
you've always been a loser.

17:37.181 --> 17:38.474
Why you little...!

17:38.557 --> 17:42.227
There's nothing in this dream world
that can't strangle you!

17:43.645 --> 17:47.483
Um, I heard you and Mommy
yelling again last night.

17:47.566 --> 17:49.443
Oh, no, no.

17:49.526 --> 17:51.361
It was just a TV show.

17:51.445 --> 17:54.656
Mitch Miller was yelling
at one of his idiot singers.

17:54.740 --> 17:57.201
You just concentrate
on catching the fish

17:57.284 --> 18:00.204
and not whether there'll be
someone there to cook it.

18:00.287 --> 18:01.747
I got a bite!

18:01.830 --> 18:03.499
We got a fish!
We got a fish!

18:03.582 --> 18:05.334
All right, settle down there, boy.

18:05.417 --> 18:07.127
After we eat it,
can we let it go?

18:07.211 --> 18:08.754
Can we catch a submarine?

18:08.837 --> 18:10.130
(both scream)

18:12.466 --> 18:14.802
<i>MONA: You got home hours late</i>
<i>with no fish.</i>

18:14.885 --> 18:16.386
It was only a few weeks later

18:16.470 --> 18:18.138
that I left your father for good.

18:18.222 --> 18:21.433
You left him because
I tipped the boat over

18:21.517 --> 18:23.060
and ruined the vacation?

18:23.143 --> 18:24.228
Pathetic.

18:24.311 --> 18:25.979
A kid who can't keep
his parents' marriage together

18:26.063 --> 18:27.481
is no kid at all.

18:27.564 --> 18:31.401
It's true! I failed the basic
duty of childhood.

18:31.485 --> 18:34.071
(gasps) And then when
I took Bart fishing,

18:34.154 --> 18:37.282
it all came back, and the guilt
made me wet the bed.

18:37.366 --> 18:40.160
Case closed.
Mm-hmm.

18:40.244 --> 18:42.037
Now, let's return
our dream skis.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.872
-Case not closed.
-Hmm?

18:43.956 --> 18:46.625
Homer, you have nothing
to feel guilty about,

18:46.708 --> 18:49.336
and I can show you.
Roll the film, Cletus.

18:49.419 --> 18:50.963
"Roll the film, Cletus."

18:51.046 --> 18:52.131
"Kiss me, Cletus."

18:52.214 --> 18:54.383
Whatever you say, boss lady.

18:55.759 --> 18:57.302
Sorry, Mona.

18:57.386 --> 19:00.180
We had more of an adventure
than we planned on.

19:00.264 --> 19:01.640
It's okay, Abe.

19:01.723 --> 19:04.434
You brought back
the only treasure I care about.

19:06.019 --> 19:09.022
And when the time came that
I had to leave your father,

19:09.106 --> 19:11.275
I knew you were
in good hands.

19:11.358 --> 19:14.361
I'm cured!
I'll never wet the bed again.

19:14.444 --> 19:16.488
And maybe you'll stop
overeating, too.

19:16.572 --> 19:17.948
No can do, baby.

19:18.031 --> 19:19.783
(loud rumbling)

19:21.368 --> 19:23.203
And never forget, Homer:

19:23.287 --> 19:27.207
the three of us will always be together,
in your memory.

19:27.291 --> 19:29.251
Right next to the movie trivia.

19:29.334 --> 19:31.170
Stanley Kubrick
wanted Robin Williams

19:31.253 --> 19:32.337
to star in <i>The Shining.</i>

19:32.421 --> 19:36.175
<i>Casablanca</i> was originally
going to star Ronald Reagan.

19:36.258 --> 19:38.343
There was a <i>Grease 2,</i>
and I wasn't in it.

19:38.427 --> 19:39.928
Whoa! Hey, watch it!

19:40.012 --> 19:41.763
-There you go again.
-Shazbot!

19:41.847 --> 19:45.058
And now you'd better run along,
sweetheart.

19:45.142 --> 19:46.727
Good-bye.

19:49.313 --> 19:51.523
Hmm?

19:51.607 --> 19:52.566
Hmm?

19:52.649 --> 19:54.234
Huh?

19:54.318 --> 19:56.361
(mumbles)

19:56.445 --> 19:58.155
(grunts)

19:58.238 --> 20:00.991
(gasping)

20:01.074 --> 20:02.910
Whoo-hoo! I'm dry!

20:02.993 --> 20:06.038
Come on, everybody,
feel Daddy's underpants!

20:06.121 --> 20:07.581
We'll take your word for it.

20:08.999 --> 20:10.334
So what do I do again?

20:10.417 --> 20:11.543
Spin the top.

20:11.627 --> 20:13.795
If it falls over,
we're in reality.

20:13.879 --> 20:16.506
If it spins forever,
we're still in a dream.

20:16.590 --> 20:17.591
All right.

20:19.927 --> 20:21.386
Look at it go!

20:21.470 --> 20:22.888
All right!

20:22.971 --> 20:24.389
Hey, since it's a dream,

20:24.473 --> 20:26.600
let's ride our bikes naked
around town.

20:26.683 --> 20:28.393
Sounds like a plan.

20:28.477 --> 20:30.187
(both laughing)

20:34.024 --> 20:35.984
MARGE:
Is that hail coming down?

20:36.068 --> 20:37.277
HOMER:
It's just dream hail.

20:37.361 --> 20:38.737
Ow! Ooh! Ow!

20:38.820 --> 20:40.656
Dream hail!
(screaming)

20:40.739 --> 20:42.032
Hey, there's a dream truck.

20:42.115 --> 20:43.408
