WEBVTT

00:01.835 --> 00:04.038
JIMMY: Living in an old house
has its challenges.

00:04.072 --> 00:05.673
Like how the water
won't run

00:05.706 --> 00:07.708
while the washing machine
is on its rinse cycle.

00:10.244 --> 00:12.046
Spin cycle!

00:13.747 --> 00:16.217
JIMMY: And the air conditioner
won't kick on

00:16.250 --> 00:18.686
unless the thermostat
thinks it's 125 degrees.

00:18.719 --> 00:20.221
Ow, it's burning
my thumb.

00:20.254 --> 00:21.589
Just power
through it.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.157
JIMMY: Or having to learn
the combination

00:23.191 --> 00:24.825
to open the front door
that sticks.

00:24.858 --> 00:25.826
Hurry.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.495
I'm trying.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.097
It's push, twist left,
pull, twist right,

00:29.130 --> 00:30.664
lift and open, right?

00:30.698 --> 00:32.733
No, no, no,
that's the back door!

00:32.766 --> 00:35.203
The front door is twist left,
pull, twist right, lift, stomp.

00:38.372 --> 00:41.175
JIMMY: But that's just part
of living in an old house.

00:41.209 --> 00:42.610
And the longer
you live there,

00:42.643 --> 00:45.179
the more it all
just becomes normal.

00:45.213 --> 00:46.714
(shrieks)

00:46.747 --> 00:49.450
I'm waiting
for the spin cycle.

00:49.483 --> 00:51.585
I think this
is the first time

00:51.619 --> 00:54.288
I've ever seen
your meat whistle, Burt.

00:54.322 --> 00:55.856
I believe
that's true.

00:55.889 --> 00:58.159
Not a fan.

01:02.596 --> 01:04.265
* Whoo!

01:04.298 --> 01:07.868
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh,

01:07.901 --> 01:09.637
* Daddy-o, oh, oh, oh

01:09.670 --> 01:14.242
* Birth control, no, no, no

01:14.275 --> 01:16.744
* Let it roll, oh, oh, oh

01:16.777 --> 01:19.713
* Oh

01:19.747 --> 01:20.748
* Oh...

01:20.781 --> 01:23.384
* Whoo!

01:23.417 --> 01:25.453
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh

01:25.486 --> 01:28.122
* Whoa, oh, oh!

01:38.699 --> 01:41.302
Hey...

01:41.335 --> 01:46.807
We are so, so, very, very,
very sorry for your loss.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.842
Thanks for using
your funeral voice,

01:48.876 --> 01:50.778
but nobody really cared
for my grandmother.

01:50.811 --> 01:53.914
Well, we wanted
to be here for you.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.483
And Jimmy said
there might be shrimp?

01:55.516 --> 01:56.684
Help yourself.

01:56.717 --> 01:57.851
Oh, hey.

01:57.885 --> 01:59.320
Hey.

01:59.353 --> 02:00.188
Oh, you brought Maw Maw.

02:00.221 --> 02:01.289
Where's the body?

02:01.322 --> 02:03.324
Oh, it's
in the kitchen.

02:03.357 --> 02:04.925
She was worried people wouldn't
pay their respects up-close,

02:04.958 --> 02:06.727
so she surrounded herself
with the buffet.

02:08.962 --> 02:10.698
Good idea.

02:10.731 --> 02:15.703
You, at my funeral, fill my
bellybutton with ranch dressing,

02:15.736 --> 02:17.705
so people will have to dip
their carrot sticks in there.

02:17.738 --> 02:19.340
I'm gonna write
that down.

02:19.373 --> 02:20.508
Okay.

02:20.541 --> 02:21.775
Is your mother here yet?

02:21.809 --> 02:23.311
She's around here somewhere.

02:23.344 --> 02:24.945
Give me something
to talk to her about.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.614
Talk about her.
She's a big fan.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.449
She went to India
and she picked up yoga.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.518
Yoga? I don't know
anything about yoga.

02:30.551 --> 02:31.719
Did she pick up
anything else in India?

02:31.752 --> 02:32.886
Diarrhea.

02:34.355 --> 02:36.190
Okay. Good.

02:36.224 --> 02:38.158
I've got a strong five
minutes on diarrhea.

02:42.996 --> 02:46.200
Make sure you bury me
in a dress like this.

02:46.234 --> 02:47.801
It looks custom-made.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.337
I'll try to find you
one kinda like it.

02:49.370 --> 02:51.405
Not kinda like it.
Just like it.

02:51.439 --> 02:53.241
And don't forget to wrap
my head in tin foil

02:53.274 --> 02:54.742
so worms don't get in.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.244
Yeah, I already told you
I'm not doing that.

02:56.277 --> 02:57.845
It's weird and it's
a waste of foil.

02:57.878 --> 02:59.913
I'm not taping one
of your eyes open either.

02:59.947 --> 03:02.350
Oh, come on,
that'll be hilarious.

03:12.460 --> 03:13.761
Mm...

03:13.794 --> 03:16.330
Mom, this is
my boyfriend Jimmy.

03:16.364 --> 03:19.367
Jimmy, this is my mother,
who is so self-involved that,

03:19.400 --> 03:21.369
though I have now
said your name twice,

03:21.402 --> 03:23.371
I bet she has no
idea what it is.

03:23.404 --> 03:24.938
Jimmy.

03:24.972 --> 03:25.839
Still doesn't.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.875
Let's not do this.
Not today.

03:27.908 --> 03:30.278
Your grandmother is dead.

03:30.311 --> 03:31.379
We should be celebrating.

03:31.412 --> 03:34.515
I may not have been
the perfect mother,

03:34.548 --> 03:37.885
but I was a hell of a lot better
to you than Nana was to me.

03:37.918 --> 03:40.354
That woman once
elbowed me in the nose

03:40.388 --> 03:42.856
because I was talking
during Wimbledon.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.358
When you were 12,

03:44.392 --> 03:45.926
did Nana leave you
alone for a weekend

03:45.959 --> 03:48.329
so she could fly to Vegas
with her boyfriend?

03:48.362 --> 03:51.031
Hey, you don't
know Richard Dawson

03:51.064 --> 03:54.702
because he's dead now,
but he used to be a big deal.

03:54.735 --> 03:58.472
So, India.

03:58.506 --> 04:02.276
I hear that place can be
a real bummer on the tummy.

04:02.310 --> 04:05.446
Is my daughter dating
you to hurt me?

04:05.479 --> 04:06.980
I hope not.

04:07.014 --> 04:08.816
Right before I die,
I want to be frozen

04:08.849 --> 04:10.584
so they can bring me back

04:10.618 --> 04:12.486
after they discover the cure
for whatever disease I had.

04:12.520 --> 04:15.356
And, of course, the cure
for being frozen to death.

04:15.389 --> 04:16.990
Frozen, huh?
What do they call that?

04:17.024 --> 04:18.792
Cryogenics.

04:18.826 --> 04:20.594
I thought cryogenics
was a religion.

04:20.628 --> 04:23.364
No, no, no, you're
thinking of Science-ology.

04:23.397 --> 04:25.299
It's that religion
that writer started.

04:25.333 --> 04:27.435
L... More Leonard.

04:27.468 --> 04:29.603
BURT: And they use their
science to freeze you

04:29.637 --> 04:31.372
and bring you
back to life, huh?

04:31.405 --> 04:32.840
We should look into that.

04:32.873 --> 04:33.841
Guys, I think the
conversation may have taken

04:33.874 --> 04:35.309
a wrong turn somewhere.

04:35.343 --> 04:37.311
If everybody could come
to the living room,

04:37.345 --> 04:39.647
my grandmother had a video
she made before she died,

04:39.680 --> 04:40.848
she wanted everyone to watch.

04:40.881 --> 04:42.916
(all groan)

04:42.950 --> 04:44.685
Yeah, she didn't think
anybody was gonna want

04:44.718 --> 04:47.321
to do that either, so she put a
chocolate fountain in there.

04:47.355 --> 04:48.489
Hmm, chocolate fountain.

04:48.522 --> 04:49.457
That's a great idea.

04:49.490 --> 04:50.491
Come on.

04:50.524 --> 04:51.892
Hm!

04:56.897 --> 04:58.399
Hello, everyone.

04:58.432 --> 05:01.101
In case you're shedding
any tears for me,

05:01.134 --> 05:02.836
please don't.

05:02.870 --> 05:05.873
By the time you see this,
I'm going to be in Heaven

05:05.906 --> 05:08.041
getting plowed
by my dead husband.

05:08.075 --> 05:10.878
When he sees me wearing
his favorite dress,

05:10.911 --> 05:14.848
I'm going to knock his halo off.

05:14.882 --> 05:17.050
I guess some of you
are curious as to what

05:17.084 --> 05:18.552
I'm going to do with my money.

05:18.586 --> 05:22.390
Hello, Tamara.

05:22.423 --> 05:23.791
Now, how would I know that

05:23.824 --> 05:26.527
you would be in the most
comfortable chair?

05:26.560 --> 05:28.128
Because I know you
like the back of my hand.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.530
You're a spoiled brat.

05:29.563 --> 05:32.366
You have no respect
for marriage or money

05:32.400 --> 05:34.402
and because of that,

05:34.435 --> 05:35.969
you get nothing.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.372
I hate you.
I hate you, too.

05:38.406 --> 05:41.041
All of the cash
I have will be donated

05:41.074 --> 05:42.976
to a non-profit organization

05:43.010 --> 05:48.048
dedicated to getting rid
of non-profit organizations.

05:48.081 --> 05:50.418
The only thing left
is this house.

05:50.451 --> 05:52.986
And I've decided to give it
to the only relative

05:53.020 --> 05:55.456
who hasn't broken my heart
by getting a divorce:

05:55.489 --> 05:57.425
Sabrina.

05:58.892 --> 05:59.927
As soon as
you get married,

05:59.960 --> 06:03.397
you can move in
and start a family.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.874
Rest in peace, sweetheart.

06:13.907 --> 06:15.409
See you
on the other side.

06:18.979 --> 06:20.448
VIRGINIA: I don't know why
we can't talk about this!

06:20.481 --> 06:21.449
Just stop it!

06:21.482 --> 06:23.083
Jimmy, you saw that house.

06:23.116 --> 06:24.918
The sooner you two are married,
the sooner we can all move in.

06:24.952 --> 06:25.919
(Sabrina laughs)

06:25.953 --> 06:27.120
That sounded a little like

06:27.154 --> 06:28.121
you think you're
gonna live there, too.

06:28.155 --> 06:29.523
Uh, yeah.

06:29.557 --> 06:30.524
Jimmy lived here
for 25 years.

06:30.558 --> 06:32.092
He owes us.

06:32.125 --> 06:33.461
This isn't your house.
It's Maw Maw's.

06:33.494 --> 06:35.128
Shh!

06:35.162 --> 06:36.063
And I would like
to live in it alone

06:36.096 --> 06:37.598
just once, before I die.

06:37.631 --> 06:40.200
So hurry up and ask that
long-haired pretty boy

06:40.233 --> 06:41.969
to marry you before the
Republicans get back in office

06:42.002 --> 06:44.204
and make it a sin.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.974
Maw Maw, I'm not telling you
this again: I'm a woman.

06:47.007 --> 06:49.209
And I'm not telling
you this again:

06:49.242 --> 06:51.111
Show me your vagina
and I'll believe you.

06:51.144 --> 06:52.813
No!
Burt showed me his.

06:54.782 --> 06:57.217
I know that sounded like
I have a vagina.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.218
I don't.

06:58.251 --> 06:58.919
She's referring to...

06:58.952 --> 07:01.455
I was peeing the other day...

07:01.489 --> 07:03.223
I'll explain later.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.593
Now, look, since
they brought it up,

07:05.626 --> 07:07.461
it is a nice house,

07:07.495 --> 07:09.997
and I mean, it's not like
we never talked about...

07:10.030 --> 07:11.164
No, no, no, no, Jimmy.

07:11.198 --> 07:13.233
No.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.936
Listen, my whole life
I've had to worry about people

07:15.969 --> 07:18.171
liking me for my
family's money.

07:18.205 --> 07:20.173
Look, you fell in love with me
for who I really am.

07:20.207 --> 07:24.512
I don't some stupid house
to be the reason we got engaged.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.480
Then it won't be the reason.

07:26.514 --> 07:28.248
You guys are
being selfish.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.517
What about Hope?

07:29.550 --> 07:31.251
She'd be in a better
school district.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.020
You really want her going to
the same schools Jimmy went to?

07:33.053 --> 07:35.122
Mom, my schools
weren't not that bad.

07:35.155 --> 07:37.491
Name four consonants.

07:37.525 --> 07:39.527
America, Europe, Mexico,
and the North Pole.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.629
Is that right? I don't know.
I went to the same schools.

07:41.662 --> 07:44.164
Mom, just drop it, okay?

07:44.197 --> 07:46.500
I didn't even think
about the schools.

07:46.534 --> 07:48.168
SABRINA:
I mean, it's good.

07:48.201 --> 07:50.037
It's where I went.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.873
It's not like I never thought
about us getting married.

07:52.906 --> 07:55.275
So...

07:55.308 --> 07:57.210
I guess we should
get married?

07:57.244 --> 08:00.681
It seems to make sense.

08:00.714 --> 08:01.782
Did we just get engaged?

08:01.815 --> 08:03.183
I think we did, yeah.

08:03.216 --> 08:05.519
Burt, go get the champagne
I was saving for when Oprah

08:05.553 --> 08:08.522
comes crawling
back to network TV.

08:08.556 --> 08:09.657
I mean, you want
to do this, right?

08:09.690 --> 08:12.225
Oh, yeah, yeah,
totally I do.

08:12.259 --> 08:15.162
Um, I think there's just...

08:15.195 --> 08:16.564
I guess when I dreamt about

08:16.597 --> 08:19.600
the man that I loved
proposing to me,

08:19.633 --> 08:22.235
I think I might have thought
I would feel something

08:22.269 --> 08:25.205
that I'd never felt
before, but you know,

08:25.238 --> 08:27.074
it's just the house
and I-I don't know...

08:27.107 --> 08:29.309
At least you're getting
married for a house.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.579
When she got married, all she
got was a ten-pound baby

08:31.612 --> 08:33.180
with a two-pound nose.

08:33.213 --> 08:35.082
Jimmy, you know what?

08:35.115 --> 08:36.650
All that really matters
is that I love you.

08:36.684 --> 08:38.185
No.

08:38.218 --> 08:40.588
No, I want you to feel
like you always dreamed

08:40.621 --> 08:42.189
you would feel
when you got engaged.

08:42.222 --> 08:44.191
I can do better.
I-I take back my proposal.

08:44.224 --> 08:45.258
No, Jimmy, really it's fine.

08:45.292 --> 08:47.695
Please, let me try again.

08:47.728 --> 08:49.062
I want to do this right.

08:49.096 --> 08:51.699
Okay. Fine.

08:51.732 --> 08:53.200
We're no longer engaged.

08:53.233 --> 08:54.568
Thanks.

08:54.602 --> 08:56.604
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

08:57.270 --> 08:59.573
Oh!

08:59.607 --> 09:01.241
They're not
engaged anymore.

09:01.274 --> 09:02.976
Seriously?

09:04.678 --> 09:07.147
Well, help me find the cork.

09:18.926 --> 09:21.128
JIMMY: The first step was to
find out what kind of proposal

09:21.161 --> 09:24.264
Sabrina had always
dreamed up without asking her.

09:24.297 --> 09:26.099
Oh, and then
when we were 11,

09:26.133 --> 09:27.968
she wanted it to be at a
surprise party surrounded

09:28.001 --> 09:29.903
by friends and family.

09:29.937 --> 09:33.674
She also thinks a Jumbo-tron
proposal'd be cool.

09:33.707 --> 09:36.309
It's in her diary:
page 82.

09:36.343 --> 09:39.312
Oh, and then she went through a
"guy on a white horse" phase

09:39.346 --> 09:43.250
in high school, and that was
followed by a skywriting phase.

09:43.283 --> 09:45.953
Her diary never mentions
horses or skywriting.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.755
She does talk about
some creepy guy at work.

09:47.788 --> 09:50.357
I think it's Chet.

09:54.795 --> 09:57.698
Hey, Mom, check
out my profile page.

09:57.731 --> 09:59.332
I finally got my new gal pal
to stand still

09:59.366 --> 10:00.367
long enough for a photo.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.275
So, what do you think?

10:08.308 --> 10:09.342
I vote
for skywriting.

10:09.376 --> 10:10.644
White horse.
Jumbo-tron.

10:10.678 --> 10:12.780
VIRGINIA: What?
No way!

10:12.813 --> 10:14.247
JIMMY:
I wanted it to be perfect

10:14.281 --> 10:16.183
but she wanted so many
different things,

10:16.216 --> 10:18.952
which was I supposed to do?

10:18.986 --> 10:20.854
(all arguing)
I got it.

10:20.888 --> 10:22.089
Good!

10:22.122 --> 10:24.024
This was
beginning to bore me.

10:24.057 --> 10:26.660
By the way, if you're going
with the white horse,

10:26.694 --> 10:29.196
I think I can get
that for you.

10:29.229 --> 10:31.398
We're talking
about heroin, right?

10:42.843 --> 10:44.678
(singsongy): He's gonna
to ask you to marry him.

10:44.712 --> 10:45.679
Maw Maw!

10:45.713 --> 10:47.681
It's okay.

10:47.715 --> 10:49.382
When you asked me to go bowling
but wear my nicest dress,

10:49.416 --> 10:50.818
I kinda knew something was up.

10:50.851 --> 10:51.651
Well, act surprised.

10:51.685 --> 10:52.886
He's really looking
forward to this.

10:52.920 --> 10:55.989
Oh, crap, I lost a meatball.

10:56.023 --> 10:57.124
Virginia?

10:57.157 --> 10:59.126
I'm looking.

10:59.159 --> 11:02.763
VIRGINIA: This is why I told you
to go with the pork chop!

11:02.796 --> 11:06.299
From now on, flat food
only in the car.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.868
I don't know if I can
do this, Virginia.

11:07.901 --> 11:08.869
What do you mean?
You already said yes.

11:08.902 --> 11:10.337
This is just for fun.

11:10.370 --> 11:13.306
Yeah, I know, but he wants me
to feel something

11:13.340 --> 11:15.008
that I never felt
before and I just...

11:15.042 --> 11:16.376
I don't think
that's going to happen.

11:16.409 --> 11:17.377
Virginia.

11:17.410 --> 11:19.146
I'm looking.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.749
I know he that loves me
and he's not asking me

11:21.782 --> 11:23.717
to marry him because of a house,
but there's no doubt

11:23.751 --> 11:26.353
that he's asking me
right now because of a house.

11:26.386 --> 11:28.756
I think my grandmother's
ruined this for me.

11:28.789 --> 11:29.757
(groans)

11:29.790 --> 11:31.859
Well, then you gotta fake it.

11:32.292 --> 11:33.260
Mmm.

11:33.293 --> 11:34.361
What?
Look...

11:34.394 --> 11:37.330
sometimes they work

11:37.364 --> 11:39.032
and work and work

11:39.066 --> 11:42.102
and they want you to feel
something you never felt before,

11:42.135 --> 11:45.038
and you know there is no way
you're ever gonna get there.

11:45.072 --> 11:48.375
So... you fake it.

11:48.408 --> 11:49.309
You do that?

11:51.144 --> 11:53.213
I love Mike and Molly,

11:53.246 --> 11:55.448
but Burt broke our VCR
killing a spider,

11:55.482 --> 11:58.285
so if a show's getting
close and I'm not,

11:58.318 --> 12:01.889
I just put on a little
performance of my own.

12:01.922 --> 12:04.457
I faked it last night...

12:04.491 --> 12:06.359
and I was by myself.

12:06.393 --> 12:09.296
I blamed it
on the arthritis, but...

12:09.329 --> 12:10.430
the truth is...

12:10.463 --> 12:14.534
I just lost interest.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.269
(sighs)
Okay.

12:16.303 --> 12:17.304
Ready?

12:23.310 --> 12:24.845
So, what do you say?

12:24.878 --> 12:27.080
Will you marry me?

12:27.114 --> 12:27.915
(gasps)

12:27.948 --> 12:29.416
Yes, yeah!

12:29.449 --> 12:30.417
Yeah, Jimmy!

12:30.450 --> 12:32.920
Oh, my God, Jimmy!

12:32.953 --> 12:34.054
Jimmy, I want to marry you!

12:34.087 --> 12:35.322
I'm gonna marry you!

12:35.355 --> 12:36.824
I'm gonna
marry you, yeah!

12:36.857 --> 12:39.392
Yes! Yes!
Yes!

12:39.426 --> 12:42.129
Yes, oh God, yes!

12:42.162 --> 12:43.563
Yeah.

12:43.596 --> 12:44.597
Wow...

12:44.631 --> 12:47.935
Jimmy just proposed
the crap out of that girl.

12:47.968 --> 12:49.937
I told you
I could do it.

12:55.008 --> 12:55.976
Pop.

12:56.009 --> 12:57.978
Whoo-hoo!

12:58.011 --> 13:00.948
(champagne sloshing)

13:00.981 --> 13:03.951
JIMMY: After almost three years
of being in love with Sabrina,

13:03.984 --> 13:06.419
I couldn't believe
we were actually engaged.

13:06.453 --> 13:09.089
And Sabrina's mom seemed
to be warming up to me.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.091
Kind of.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.093
Sabrina, Timmy...

13:13.126 --> 13:14.962
Jimmy.
Jimmy.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.864
In a lot of ways,

13:16.897 --> 13:19.066
I don't think that you're
good enough for my daughter.

13:24.872 --> 13:26.840
To Sabrina and Timmy.

13:26.874 --> 13:28.976
Jimmy.
(laughs uncomfortably)

13:29.009 --> 13:31.011
JIMMY:
Most importantly, Sabrina and I

13:31.044 --> 13:32.812
were as happy
as we've ever been.

13:36.349 --> 13:39.619
In lieu of words strung
together to form sentences,

13:39.652 --> 13:42.322
I have prepared a slide show
to celebrate the life

13:42.355 --> 13:44.324
of the bride and groom.

14:07.915 --> 14:09.216
Okay...

14:09.249 --> 14:12.419
those were supposed
to go by a lot faster.

14:12.452 --> 14:14.421
(everyone laughs)

14:14.454 --> 14:16.589
Look, it's Insane Clown Wussy.

14:16.623 --> 14:19.893
(everyone laughing)

14:19.927 --> 14:21.528
We all go through phases, Dad.

14:21.561 --> 14:23.964
SABRINA:
Ha! Speaking of phases.

14:23.997 --> 14:26.166
Hey, Mom, you
remember that summer?

14:26.199 --> 14:27.901
I think that was the only summer

14:27.935 --> 14:29.436
you had your old nose
and your new boobs.

14:31.972 --> 14:33.540
I'm just saying,

14:33.573 --> 14:36.443
I can't believe you got a
boob job before a nose job.

14:38.611 --> 14:41.448
Your grandmother
did this my nose.

14:41.481 --> 14:45.552
I wanted her to see that it
did not affect my self-esteem.

14:45.585 --> 14:49.556
But, in order for that to work,
I needed much bigger boobs.

14:49.589 --> 14:52.525
Just stop coming on the boat
with me and my friends, okay?

14:52.559 --> 14:54.361
No matter how big
your new boobs are,

14:54.394 --> 14:56.196
the boys aren't going
to hook up with you.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.564
You're old.

14:57.597 --> 14:59.566
If the boat tips over,

14:59.599 --> 15:03.436
those boys are gonna be
clinging to me for dear life.

15:03.470 --> 15:05.105
And I am not old.

15:05.138 --> 15:08.341
I can name every single
character on Laguna Beach.

15:11.311 --> 15:12.712
Come on, man.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.047
You're in my math class.

15:14.081 --> 15:15.448
No, I'm not.

15:15.482 --> 15:17.951
I'm that guy's father,
Burt Chance.

15:17.985 --> 15:20.020
Go ahead,
ask me anything.

15:20.053 --> 15:22.622
I memorized it all.

15:22.655 --> 15:24.591
I'll take that beer.

15:24.624 --> 15:26.593
But I hate
to drink alone.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.595
Unless you think
I'm too old.

15:34.767 --> 15:38.271
(squeaking)

15:38.305 --> 15:40.974
What are you wearing?

15:41.008 --> 15:42.142
I'm not sure.

15:42.175 --> 15:44.277
I got most of this
at a yard sale.

15:44.311 --> 15:47.180
I think it's like
a cool Goth back brace.

15:47.214 --> 15:48.648
It's a corset.

15:48.681 --> 15:50.150
Seriously?

15:50.183 --> 15:52.619
Like, one of those
old-timey bras they wore

15:52.652 --> 15:53.987
back when you were my age?

15:54.021 --> 15:56.223
TAMARA:
Get the hell out of my car!

16:09.236 --> 16:11.638
* Hana loka mu's
the word for bride *

16:11.671 --> 16:13.640
* Noka Nu is how
you say groom *

16:13.673 --> 16:17.710
* And when the Hana loka mu
meets the little Noka Nu *

16:17.744 --> 16:20.713
* They have
a Takaniki honeymoon *

16:20.747 --> 16:22.449
* I don't actually know
any Hawaiian *

16:22.482 --> 16:25.285
* And I just made up
all those words *

16:25.318 --> 16:27.287
* But let's a raise
a glass of booze *

16:27.320 --> 16:30.323
* For the upcoming nuptials
and wish you *

16:30.357 --> 16:32.625
* A Nakiliki Mekaliki Maki
Hoki Poo! *

16:32.659 --> 16:33.626
(Hope giggles)

16:33.660 --> 16:35.695
(everyone cheers)

16:47.540 --> 16:48.575
What are you doing?

16:48.608 --> 16:52.212
Uh, your father
wanted to take a bath

16:52.245 --> 16:55.148
and I lost
an earring in the...

16:55.182 --> 16:56.583
Grown-up stuff.
We're doing grown-up stuff.

16:56.616 --> 16:58.085
JIMMY:
Well...

16:58.118 --> 16:59.552
don't get used
to this house

16:59.586 --> 17:01.221
'cause I think just
blew it for all of us.

17:01.254 --> 17:02.689
I made out
with Sabrina's mom.

17:02.722 --> 17:05.392
Jimmy, do you know how
inappropriate that is?

17:05.425 --> 17:07.360
The...

17:07.394 --> 17:08.828
What is going
on in here?

17:08.861 --> 17:10.597
Look...

17:10.630 --> 17:12.732
you have got to get back
out there and act normal.

17:12.765 --> 17:13.766
Act normal?

17:13.800 --> 17:15.735
Are you kidding me?

17:15.768 --> 17:18.338
You're gonna be my mother-in-law
and seven years ago,

17:18.371 --> 17:20.840
we were making out
in the back of a car.

17:20.873 --> 17:23.610
Just get it together.

17:23.643 --> 17:26.113
I am trying to have a better
relationship with my daughter

17:26.146 --> 17:29.416
and that is never gonna happen
if she finds out about this.

17:29.449 --> 17:31.751
So, if anyone asks
what we were doing in here,

17:31.784 --> 17:34.787
let's all just say cocaine.

17:38.258 --> 17:41.628
My husband wasn't my first
choice, but back then

17:41.661 --> 17:43.463
there was no way my parents
were going to let me marry

17:43.496 --> 17:46.599
a Jewish guy or a black guy
or a... or an Asian guy.

17:46.633 --> 17:50.270
I often wondered
what happened to Wang.

17:50.303 --> 17:51.471
That was the black guy.

17:51.504 --> 17:55.108
His nickname was Wang.

17:57.610 --> 17:58.645
I don't know what to do.

17:58.678 --> 18:01.781
I can't lie to Sabrina.

18:01.814 --> 18:02.915
VIRGINIA:
Don't be an idiot.

18:02.949 --> 18:05.818
You didn't know it was Sabrina's
mother when it happened.

18:05.852 --> 18:07.720
It's seven years.

18:07.754 --> 18:10.157
You probably don't even remember
what her fake boobs felt like.

18:10.190 --> 18:12.125
Do ya?
Burt.

18:12.159 --> 18:15.128
Oh, come on.
I got married at 17.

18:15.162 --> 18:17.164
The closest I ever got
to a fake boob

18:17.197 --> 18:19.132
was going up Kathy Conklin's
shirt and coming out

18:19.166 --> 18:21.134
with a plastic baggy
full of mashed potatoes.

18:21.168 --> 18:22.769
I have to assume
they've gotten better.

18:22.802 --> 18:25.305
Jimmy, you would only
be telling Sabrina

18:25.338 --> 18:26.773
what happened to make
yourself feel better.

18:26.806 --> 18:27.907
BURT:
Think about Sabrina.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.776
How is she going to ever
kiss you again

18:29.809 --> 18:31.744
knowing you made out
with her mother? It's gross.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.580
JIMMY: So I'm
supposed to go out there

18:33.613 --> 18:35.148
and act normal for
the rest of the night?

18:35.182 --> 18:36.183
For the rest of my life?

18:36.216 --> 18:37.817
Yeah, fake it.

18:37.850 --> 18:39.786
The way Sabrina totally
faked how happy she was

18:39.819 --> 18:40.853
when you proposed tonight.

18:40.887 --> 18:42.789
What?
She wasn't faking it.

18:42.822 --> 18:45.325
Come on, she said your
name a bunch of times,

18:45.358 --> 18:47.294
threw in a few "Oh Gods,"

18:47.327 --> 18:48.795
did all your mother's
Monday night moves.

18:48.828 --> 18:50.297
Wha...? I didn't...

18:50.330 --> 18:52.599
Can't believe
she was faking it.

18:52.632 --> 18:53.933
She seemed so excited.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.935
She only faked it
because she loves you.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.604
And that's why you need
to fake it with her.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.906
So get out there and act
like nothing's wrong.

19:02.909 --> 19:05.178
If you knew I fake
it on Monday nights,

19:05.212 --> 19:06.646
why haven't you
ever said anything?

19:06.679 --> 19:08.181
'Cause you put
on a great show

19:08.215 --> 19:10.883
and then I get
to watch Mike and Molly.

19:14.221 --> 19:16.856
And even though it started out
with what they would call today

19:16.889 --> 19:21.294
a date rape, our marriage
lasted 67 years.

19:21.328 --> 19:26.666
And, uh, since I suddenly
can't remember where I am

19:26.699 --> 19:30.203
or who any of you people is,

19:30.237 --> 19:31.338
well, I'll just say
"Happy New Year's."

19:32.872 --> 19:33.840
SABRINA:
Happy New Year.

19:33.873 --> 19:35.508
(giggles)

19:35.542 --> 19:37.344
Seven years ago,
I made out with your mother

19:37.377 --> 19:38.345
in the back of a car.

19:38.378 --> 19:39.712
(both gibbering anxiously)

19:39.746 --> 19:41.248
And I fiddled with her
knockers a little.

19:41.281 --> 19:42.982
(gasps)
(sighs)

19:43.015 --> 19:45.985
I am so sorry,
all right?

19:46.018 --> 19:47.086
I just... I didn't
want you to kiss me

19:47.119 --> 19:48.888
because I thought you might
not want to kiss the guy

19:48.921 --> 19:50.357
who made out
with your mother.

19:50.390 --> 19:51.924
Although, I mean,
you have kissed the guy

19:51.958 --> 19:53.360
who made out
with your mother,

19:53.393 --> 19:54.661
you just, you just
didn't know it.

19:54.694 --> 19:55.528
Look, I didn't know it.

19:55.562 --> 19:56.829
I just found out
when I watched the video

19:56.863 --> 19:58.298
that I'd made out
with your mother.

19:58.331 --> 19:59.866
Is it just me or is
he saying the words

19:59.899 --> 20:01.868
"I made out with your mother"
way more than he needs to?

20:01.901 --> 20:03.135
Yeah, I don't know
why he's doing that.

20:03.169 --> 20:06.239
You know, I'm sure that he has
brushed his teeth a whole bunch

20:06.273 --> 20:07.574
since then, sweetheart.

20:07.607 --> 20:08.941
And, also, the boobs
that he grabbed,

20:08.975 --> 20:10.877
they're not even mine anymore.

20:10.910 --> 20:12.845
After the recall,
your Uncle Andy turned them

20:12.879 --> 20:14.381
into an art piece for Nana.

20:18.551 --> 20:19.952
(sighs)
Go ahead.

20:19.986 --> 20:21.688
I'm sorry.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.256
I just love you so much

20:23.290 --> 20:24.891
that I didn't want to spend

20:24.924 --> 20:27.927
the rest of my life keeping
any secrets from you.

20:27.960 --> 20:32.332
So, if you don't want to
marry me, you don't have to.

20:32.365 --> 20:33.800
But I want to marry you.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.802
Really badly.

20:35.835 --> 20:40.340
So... I'm gonna
ask you again.

20:40.373 --> 20:42.775
Will you marry me?

20:44.377 --> 20:48.348
(sighs)
Yes.

20:53.420 --> 20:54.621
JIMMY: By being willing
to lose everything,

20:54.654 --> 20:56.389
I was able to show Sabrina

20:56.423 --> 20:57.990
I loved her 100%
for who she was

20:58.024 --> 21:00.427
and give her the feeling

21:00.460 --> 21:02.629
she's been waiting
for her whole life.

21:02.662 --> 21:05.698
And she didn't have to fake it.

21:10.337 --> 21:11.971
And we weren't the only
ones who weren't going

21:12.004 --> 21:13.540
to fake it anymore.

21:19.412 --> 21:22.649
All right, we are recording
Mike and Molly,

21:22.682 --> 21:24.917
so you can take
as much time as you need.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.519
But try not
to take too much time.

21:26.553 --> 21:26.619
I'm recording over some
of my favorite karate movies.
