00:03.023 --> 00:04.864
Should you really be
sitting in Sheldon's spot?

00:06.260 --> 00:08.194
He's in Texas.
He'll never know.

00:08.196 --> 00:09.962
I wouldn't be
so sure about that.

00:09.964 --> 00:11.564
Yeah, he has
a very sensitive butt.

00:14.134 --> 00:15.434
Well, it's true.

00:15.436 --> 00:18.838
Once I saw him sit on a bunch
of loose change and add it up.

00:20.307 --> 00:21.440
Have you heard from Howard?

00:21.442 --> 00:23.676
I did.
His talk at NASA went great.

00:23.678 --> 00:24.910
Sheldon didn't heckle him?

00:24.912 --> 00:26.579
No, in fact, he was
so well-behaved,

00:26.581 --> 00:28.280
Howie bought him
a Buzz Aldrin bobble head

00:28.282 --> 00:29.582
and astronaut ice cream.

00:30.818 --> 00:32.183
Hey, guys.

00:32.186 --> 00:33.486
Oh, hi. - Hi, Stewart.
Hey, Stewart!

00:33.488 --> 00:35.354
How's it going?
Good.

00:35.356 --> 00:37.990
Sheldon's out of town,
so we can do whatever we want.

00:37.992 --> 00:40.126
We even ordered from
the Thai place he doesn't like.

00:40.128 --> 00:41.260
Oh, how is it?

00:41.262 --> 00:43.295
Disgusting. Do not tell him.

00:44.297 --> 00:45.765
What do you guys want
to do tonight?

00:45.767 --> 00:46.832
I don't know.

00:46.834 --> 00:48.401
Well, I told Howie
if I wasn't busy,

00:48.403 --> 00:50.002
I'd spend the night
at his mom's.

00:50.004 --> 00:52.271
So for God's sake,
think of something.

00:54.842 --> 00:56.142
Stuart?

00:56.144 --> 00:57.176
Are you okay?

00:57.178 --> 00:59.545
No, I don't feel so...

00:59.547 --> 01:01.213
Oh, Stuart?
Stuart?

01:01.215 --> 01:03.115
Oh, my God,
you guys need to do something!

01:03.117 --> 01:05.184
Stuart?
Calling 911.

01:05.186 --> 01:07.319
Well, it's too late.
What do you mean it's too late?

01:07.321 --> 01:10.556
He's been murdered
by someone in this room.

01:12.093 --> 01:14.460
Oh, my God.
Oh, come on!

01:14.462 --> 01:15.995

01:15.997 --> 01:19.832

01:19.834 --> 01:20.900
I'm leaving.

01:20.902 --> 01:23.302
You can't leave.

01:23.304 --> 01:24.970
You're a suspect in
the mysterious murder

01:24.972 --> 01:27.006
of Stuart Bloom.

01:29.177 --> 01:31.577
I didn't know his
last name was Bloom.

01:31.579 --> 01:33.946
Yeah, it's Bloom.

01:33.948 --> 01:35.181
Are you really gonna
lie on the floor

01:35.183 --> 01:36.549
and pretend
to be dead all night?

01:36.551 --> 01:38.751

02:09.618 --> 02:11.886
Are you gonna make us pretend
to be a bunch of lame characters

02:11.888 --> 02:13.588
with silly accents?

02:13.590 --> 02:16.557
"Lame characters
with silly ac..."

02:16.559 --> 02:19.260
What kind of actress are you?

02:21.363 --> 02:22.630
You're right, I'm sorry.

02:22.632 --> 02:25.133
It... sounds like fun.
Thank you.

02:25.135 --> 02:26.868
That kind of actress.
This sucks!

02:28.771 --> 02:29.938
Come on, guys.

02:29.940 --> 02:31.105
Raj put a lot of
effort into this.

02:31.107 --> 02:32.140
And that's great.

02:32.142 --> 02:35.443
It's not sad, it's great.

02:35.445 --> 02:37.378
I think it might be fun
to be someone else tonight.

02:37.380 --> 02:39.013
Actually, you're all just
gonna be yourselves.

02:39.015 --> 02:40.815
Oh... ugh.

02:42.184 --> 02:43.618
All right,
if I'm doing this,

02:43.620 --> 02:45.553
I'm playing to win,
so just to be clear:

02:45.555 --> 02:47.956
If we're ourselves, that means
one of us killed Stuart?

02:47.958 --> 02:49.057
Very good, Bernadette.

02:49.059 --> 02:51.592
You are a regular
Byomkesh Bakshi.

02:51.594 --> 02:54.796
What is that, like,
the Indian Sherlock Holmes?

02:54.798 --> 02:58.700
Or is Sherlock Holmes
the English Byomkesh Bakshi?

02:59.969 --> 03:02.003
According to Wikipedia,
Sherlock Holmes came first.

03:02.005 --> 03:04.872
Great, everyone's
a Byomkesh Bakshi.

03:04.874 --> 03:06.908
Now... here are

03:06.910 --> 03:09.310
some secret facts

03:09.312 --> 03:10.645
about each of you,

03:10.647 --> 03:13.581
including whether
you are the murderer.

03:13.583 --> 03:14.949
Throughout the game, feel free

03:14.951 --> 03:17.385
to ask each other questions
to uncover clues.

03:17.387 --> 03:18.920
Got it. Hey...

03:18.922 --> 03:21.222
who's the murderer?

03:22.491 --> 03:25.226
Any question but that.

03:25.228 --> 03:27.228
Sorry. Hey...

03:27.230 --> 03:30.064
who's <i>not</i> the murderer?

03:31.200 --> 03:34.736
Bernadette, can you not stand
so close to me?

03:34.738 --> 03:35.737
What do you care? You're dead.

03:35.739 --> 03:36.938
Suit yourself.

03:36.940 --> 03:39.640
But I can kind of...
see up your skirt.

03:41.000 --> 03:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:48.150 --> 03:50.551
Thank you
for my bobble head.

03:50.553 --> 03:53.788
Thank you for not making fun
of me during my speech.

03:53.790 --> 03:55.957
It wasn't easy. Was it Buzz?

03:59.328 --> 04:01.729
We can't show up to
your mom's empty-handed.

04:01.731 --> 04:03.364
We should bring something.

04:03.366 --> 04:04.932
I already am.

04:04.934 --> 04:06.868
I'm bringing
the gift of knowledge.

04:06.870 --> 04:08.736
Oh, boy.

04:08.738 --> 04:10.905
Despite what her Bible says,

04:10.907 --> 04:12.840
recent archeological
studies indicate

04:12.842 --> 04:15.710
that although camels are
referenced in the Old Testament,

04:15.712 --> 04:17.577
they didn't exist
in the Middle East

04:17.579 --> 04:19.981
until hundreds of years later.

04:19.983 --> 04:22.784
I was gonna say we pick up
a cake or a pie.

04:22.786 --> 04:25.353
But an insult to her faith
is always thoughtful.

04:28.891 --> 04:30.558
So, what happens next?

04:30.560 --> 04:32.126
I can't tell you that.

04:32.128 --> 04:33.461
But perhaps the killer dropped

04:33.463 --> 04:35.129
a fun and imaginative clue

04:35.131 --> 04:36.831
somewhere in the apartment.

04:36.833 --> 04:37.965
Ooh, I'm gonna check the fridge,

04:37.967 --> 04:40.802
and see if there are
any clues inside a beer.

04:41.970 --> 04:43.438
Hey, I-I found something.

04:43.440 --> 04:45.373
It looks like a little man
with a briefcase.

04:45.375 --> 04:47.542
Oh, no, no.
That's Clarence Darrow.

04:47.544 --> 04:50.945
It's from a game Sheldon made up
called <i>Chutes and Lawyers.</i>

04:52.815 --> 04:54.582
You slide down a chute
and then work your way back up

04:54.584 --> 04:56.784
through the appellate system.

04:58.220 --> 05:01.823
Well, unlike that,
my games are much more fun.

05:01.825 --> 05:02.890
Okay, can I ask you something?

05:02.892 --> 05:04.292
Why do you like making us
do this stuff?

05:04.294 --> 05:06.627
Well, I guess
it goes back to

05:06.629 --> 05:08.996
when I was a fat kid in India,
and didn't have any friends.

05:08.998 --> 05:10.298
I didn't know you were fat.

05:10.300 --> 05:11.632
Yeah, I was...

05:11.634 --> 05:14.402
I was 200 pounds by the time
I was in middle school.

05:14.404 --> 05:16.304
Kids were mean.

05:16.306 --> 05:17.505
Cows may be sacred there,

05:17.507 --> 05:19.707
but it doesn't help
if you look like one.

05:21.543 --> 05:22.743
Anyway, I was pretty lonely,

05:22.745 --> 05:24.612
so I had to make up
my own stories and games,

05:24.614 --> 05:25.913
and I promised myself

05:25.915 --> 05:28.082
if I ever made
any friends that...

05:28.084 --> 05:30.518
that I would play
those games with them.

05:30.520 --> 05:32.520
That is so sweet.

05:32.522 --> 05:34.288
I've seen old pictures of you.

05:34.290 --> 05:36.057
You were never a fat kid.

05:36.059 --> 05:37.825
No, I was svelte as a gazelle.

05:39.528 --> 05:42.430
A gazelle blessed with a flair
for storytelling.

05:46.135 --> 05:48.870
Hey, what about this?
It looks like a receipt.

05:48.872 --> 05:49.804
What's it for?

05:49.806 --> 05:50.905
For a cup of coffee.

05:50.907 --> 05:52.907
But it's dated
20 years from now.

05:52.909 --> 05:54.342
From the future?!

05:54.344 --> 05:56.511
How fun and imaginative.

05:57.913 --> 06:00.448
So one of us came back
from the future

06:00.450 --> 06:02.216
to murder Stuart?
Correct.

06:02.218 --> 06:04.118
Does the gazelle with a flair
for storytelling

06:04.120 --> 06:06.654
know he's just ripping off
<i>Terminator?</i>

06:06.656 --> 06:09.123
Does the smart-ass know
that <i>Terminator</i> was actually

06:09.125 --> 06:10.858
ripped off from an <i>Outer Limits</i>
script called

06:10.860 --> 06:13.027
<i>Demon With a Glass Hand,</i>
by Harlan Ellison?

06:13.029 --> 06:16.330
Oh, does the gazelle know that
according to Harlan Ellison,

06:16.332 --> 06:18.733
it was not ripped off
from <i>Demon With a Glass Hand,</i>

06:18.735 --> 06:21.335
but was ripped off from another
<i>Outer Limits</i> script

06:21.337 --> 06:22.937
he wrote called <i>The Soldier?</i>

06:22.939 --> 06:25.173
I'm gonna need
another clue.

06:28.610 --> 06:30.144
Okay...

06:30.146 --> 06:32.113
give me
the flowers and pie.

06:32.115 --> 06:34.215
But if we show up
and you're holding them,

06:34.217 --> 06:36.150
she'll think
they're only from you.

06:36.152 --> 06:37.552
They are only from me.

06:37.554 --> 06:40.521
You said the gift
of you was enough.

06:40.523 --> 06:42.990
Yes... but now

06:42.992 --> 06:44.725
that I've seen
what the gift of me

06:44.727 --> 06:46.127
with flowers and pie looks like,

06:46.129 --> 06:47.662
there's no going back.

06:49.431 --> 06:53.000
Boy, I can't wait to see
the look on her face...

06:53.002 --> 06:54.202
We're leaving right now.

06:54.204 --> 06:55.369
What's wrong?
Nothing.

06:55.371 --> 06:57.772
What? Sheldon, tell me
what's going on!

06:57.774 --> 06:59.173
I saw my mommy with a naked man

06:59.175 --> 07:00.808
and she was trying
to be a mommy again.

07:13.552 --> 07:15.453
You ready to talk about it?

07:15.455 --> 07:17.588
I'm not nearly drunk enough.

07:20.092 --> 07:23.194
Okay.

07:25.166 --> 07:27.134
Do you have any idea
what it's like to see

07:27.136 --> 07:29.069
your mother ravaging someone?

07:29.071 --> 07:32.506
Does a brisket count?

07:35.376 --> 07:37.544
I'm sorry, buddy, that's rough.

07:37.546 --> 07:39.045
But didn't she know
we were coming?

07:39.047 --> 07:40.046
No.

07:40.048 --> 07:41.915
I wanted to surprise her.

07:41.917 --> 07:45.018
What am I supposed to say to
her after something like this?

07:45.020 --> 07:46.853
Well, did she see you
in the window?

07:46.855 --> 07:47.954
No.

07:47.956 --> 07:49.055
Then don't say anything.

07:49.057 --> 07:51.258
I have to.

07:51.260 --> 07:54.027
How can we ever hope to have
a healthy relationship

07:54.029 --> 07:56.429
if I don't tell her
how disappointed I am,

07:56.431 --> 07:58.798
and that I'll never forgive her?

07:58.800 --> 08:01.868
Well, don't do it on the phone.

08:01.870 --> 08:03.370
No, I'm just going
to tell her I'm coming

08:03.372 --> 08:06.740
so she can give that Good
Time Charlie the heave-ho.

08:06.742 --> 08:08.508
That's some tough talk.

08:08.510 --> 08:10.143
I may need to cut you off.

08:11.179 --> 08:12.279
Yeah, maybe you better.

08:12.281 --> 08:14.481
I took a pretty big sip.

08:17.585 --> 08:20.187
Look, she's a grown woman.

08:20.189 --> 08:23.857
And-and your dad's been
gone a long time.

08:23.859 --> 08:26.793
Maybe this is
none of your business.

08:26.795 --> 08:28.762
I beg to differ.

08:28.764 --> 08:31.231
I used to live in
those genitals.

08:32.866 --> 08:34.668
And if someone wants
to move into my old room,

08:34.669 --> 08:36.102
I should at least get a vote.

08:40.707 --> 08:42.909
Okay, murder suspects,

08:42.910 --> 08:45.912
Leonard has found the time
machine the killer must've used.

08:45.914 --> 08:47.047
You're all inside it,

08:47.049 --> 08:49.683
and we hurtle
through the very fabric of time.

08:57.592 --> 09:01.094
And welcome
to 20 years in the future.

09:02.830 --> 09:04.731
Hey, you guys
just time-traveled.

09:04.733 --> 09:07.334
Stop looking so bored.

09:07.336 --> 09:09.803
Well, my beer isn't flat
and my rack's not saggy.

09:09.805 --> 09:11.938
So far, the future's great.

09:13.107 --> 09:16.176
Hey, can I go to the bathroom?

09:16.178 --> 09:18.345
Fine, just try not
to look too alive.

09:18.347 --> 09:19.446
That's my jam.

09:22.250 --> 09:25.252
So one of us went back
in time to kill Stuart?

09:25.254 --> 09:26.353
But why?

09:26.355 --> 09:28.188
Perhaps this will help.

09:28.190 --> 09:29.289
Here are some facts

09:29.291 --> 09:32.926
about yourselves in the future

09:32.928 --> 09:35.996
that might contain a clue.

09:35.998 --> 09:36.997
Hey, I-I won

09:36.999 --> 09:38.965
the Nobel Prize in physiology.

09:38.967 --> 09:41.701
Then I used the money to buy
Stuart's comic book store,

09:41.703 --> 09:45.438
and close it down so Sheldon
would pay attention to me.

09:47.642 --> 09:50.410
Not the worst idea.

09:51.579 --> 09:54.147
Hey, I'm a famous actress
living in London.

09:54.149 --> 09:56.082
Hmm! I'm a professor at Stanford.
Hmm!

09:56.084 --> 09:57.984
So I guess you two are
making it work long distance.

09:57.986 --> 09:59.252
Oh, no.

09:59.254 --> 10:01.521
In this game,
as your careers both took off,

10:01.523 --> 10:02.355
you drifted apart.

10:02.357 --> 10:04.057
Kind of like how future me

10:04.059 --> 10:06.326
lost touch with you guys
after I became boy toy

10:06.328 --> 10:09.963
for the wrinkled,
but still flexible, Madonna.

10:11.198 --> 10:13.533
What does
your card say, Bernadette?

10:13.535 --> 10:14.634
Eh, eh, eh, hang on.

10:14.636 --> 10:16.636
Do-do you think
we'd really drift apart

10:16.638 --> 10:18.204
if we both became successful?

10:18.206 --> 10:19.673
Of course not.

10:19.675 --> 10:21.341
If I became a famous actress
and had to move,

10:21.343 --> 10:22.776
you would just come with me.

10:24.111 --> 10:26.379
But if I get a chance
to be a tenured professor,

10:26.381 --> 10:28.948
I might not have that much
choice in where I end up.

10:28.950 --> 10:30.784
Yeah, but if I become
a successful actress,

10:30.786 --> 10:32.352
we wouldn't need the money.

10:32.354 --> 10:35.388
Well, you don't go
into science for the money.

10:35.390 --> 10:36.389
Speak for yourself.

10:36.391 --> 10:38.358
Last month,
my company both invented

10:38.360 --> 10:41.361
and cured
Restless Eye Syndrome.

10:43.698 --> 10:46.466
Ka-ching,
ya blinky chumps.

10:48.002 --> 10:50.003
So, wait, if my career
took me somewhere else,

10:50.005 --> 10:51.404
you might not go?

10:51.406 --> 10:52.872
Well...

10:55.843 --> 10:58.511
He started it.

10:58.513 --> 11:01.047
Okay, okay, guys--
new back stories.

11:01.049 --> 11:04.184
Uh, Penny and Leonard,
you two lovebirds are

11:04.186 --> 11:06.453
super successful
and living in New York.

11:06.455 --> 11:08.254
Uh, you're an actress,
you're a professor

11:08.256 --> 11:09.756
and you have
three beautiful kids.

11:09.758 --> 11:10.790
Great.

11:10.792 --> 11:11.925
Really? You think I'm putting

11:11.927 --> 11:13.426
this body through three kids?

11:15.963 --> 11:17.864
Okay, let's do this.

11:17.866 --> 11:18.898
Good luck.

11:18.900 --> 11:20.033
You...

11:20.035 --> 11:21.701
Aren't you gonna come with me?

11:21.703 --> 11:24.204
While you confront your mother
about her sex life?

11:24.206 --> 11:27.774
I'd rather go back to that bar
in ass-less chaps.

11:33.414 --> 11:35.482
Mother?

11:35.484 --> 11:36.883
Mother.

11:36.885 --> 11:38.351
Mother?

11:38.353 --> 11:41.254
Shelly!
I'm so glad you're here!

11:41.256 --> 11:43.223
I saw you having naked sex.

11:46.060 --> 11:47.594
What are you talking about?

11:47.596 --> 11:49.796
Earlier, I came here
to surprise you.

11:49.798 --> 11:52.799
I looked in the window
and I saw you with a man.

11:52.801 --> 11:55.635
Oh, Shelly, I'm so sorry.

11:55.637 --> 11:57.270
Come in.

11:59.573 --> 12:00.907
Um...

12:00.909 --> 12:03.410
Maybe we should sit down

12:03.412 --> 12:05.111
and talk about this.

12:05.113 --> 12:07.380
Can you recommend a surface

12:07.382 --> 12:09.549
you haven't had coitus on?

12:11.452 --> 12:13.953
That's not funny.

12:16.957 --> 12:19.559
Maybe we should sit
at the table.

12:26.934 --> 12:29.135
Well, I'm sure that, uh,

12:29.137 --> 12:31.471
you...

12:31.473 --> 12:33.473
have a lot of questions.

12:33.475 --> 12:35.575
Who was he?

12:35.577 --> 12:36.543
His name is Ron.

12:36.545 --> 12:38.611
I met him at my prayer group.

12:39.613 --> 12:41.481
How long have you been
involved with him?

12:41.483 --> 12:42.682
A few months.

12:42.684 --> 12:44.684
And of those few months,

12:44.686 --> 12:48.121
how long have you been
a demented sex pervert?

12:51.058 --> 12:53.593
That is no way
to speak to your mother.

12:53.595 --> 12:55.161
Perhaps not.

12:55.163 --> 12:57.997
But it is a way to speak
to a woman who quoted the Bible

12:57.999 --> 13:00.066
to me my whole life,
and then desecrates

13:00.068 --> 13:02.936
one of Ethan Allen's
finest sofas.

13:02.938 --> 13:05.171
I will give you one opportunity,

13:05.173 --> 13:06.306
young man, to apologize.

13:06.308 --> 13:08.675
Or what?

13:08.677 --> 13:09.909
Or I will send you to your room.

13:09.911 --> 13:12.178
That's ridiculous.

13:12.180 --> 13:13.947
I am a grown man.

13:13.949 --> 13:15.782
I am a professional scientist.

13:15.784 --> 13:18.218
And I currently occupy
the moral high ground.

13:18.220 --> 13:19.252
Go to your room.

13:20.788 --> 13:24.624
But I occupy
the moral high ground.

13:24.626 --> 13:25.825
Go to your room.

13:25.827 --> 13:28.862
But I'm
a professional scientist.

13:28.864 --> 13:31.631
Go... to your room!

13:36.036 --> 13:38.371
I'm a grown man.

13:40.808 --> 13:42.742
Can we please get back
to the game?

13:42.744 --> 13:43.843
I-I-In a minute.

13:43.845 --> 13:45.311
I-I-I don't understand
why any success

13:45.313 --> 13:47.313
you have in acting
is more important

13:47.315 --> 13:49.082
than any I have in science.

13:49.084 --> 13:51.117
Okay, if you do
something cool in science,

13:51.119 --> 13:52.385
you might change the world.

13:52.387 --> 13:53.520
If I become

13:53.522 --> 13:55.221
a famous actress...

13:55.223 --> 13:57.524
I'm not gonna tell you
why movie stars are the best.

13:57.526 --> 13:59.158
They just are.

14:00.361 --> 14:02.962
I'm surprised you guys never
talked about this stuff.

14:02.964 --> 14:05.198
Like you and Sheldon have
everything figured out?

14:05.200 --> 14:06.299
Actually,

14:06.301 --> 14:07.267
our relationship agreement

14:07.269 --> 14:09.469
covers a wide array
of scenarios,

14:09.471 --> 14:12.038
including career changes,
financial instability,

14:12.040 --> 14:14.474
intelligent dog uprising...

14:15.175 --> 14:16.943
FYI, we plan on selling out

14:16.945 --> 14:19.112
the human race hard.

14:22.049 --> 14:25.018
In 20 years, who knows
what'll happen with any of us?

14:25.020 --> 14:27.487
I think you and Leonard
will be together.

14:27.489 --> 14:29.055
You do?
Yeah.

14:29.057 --> 14:31.224
I think you're
the best couple I know.

14:31.226 --> 14:32.825
Aw.
That's so sweet.

14:32.827 --> 14:35.228
What the hell?!
Excuse me?

14:35.230 --> 14:36.195
Ah-da-da-da-da!

14:36.197 --> 14:38.164
Let the dead man talk.

14:39.266 --> 14:40.400
So, why do you think that?

14:40.402 --> 14:42.201
Uh, well, I feel like

14:42.203 --> 14:45.271
you guys make each
other better.

14:45.273 --> 14:47.106
Penny brought Leonard
out of his shell.

14:47.108 --> 14:48.341
And it seems like Leonard

14:48.343 --> 14:50.443
makes Penny think more
deeply about the world.

14:50.445 --> 14:51.611
I don't know.

14:51.613 --> 14:54.681
Together, you two kind of
make one awesome person.

14:54.683 --> 14:56.883
Aw, Stuart.

14:56.885 --> 14:59.419
Now I feel bad
for murdering you.

14:59.421 --> 15:02.121
Oh, come on!

15:02.123 --> 15:03.590
Penny did it! I win!

15:03.592 --> 15:06.559
Suck it, jackasses!

15:12.200 --> 15:14.867
Hey, can I come in?

15:14.869 --> 15:16.803
Apparently any man
is welcome in this house.

15:16.805 --> 15:18.938
Why not you?

15:20.741 --> 15:22.375
I thought you were waiting
in the car.

15:22.377 --> 15:24.377
That was an hour ago, Sheldon.

15:24.379 --> 15:26.980
A Jew sits in front of a house
in Texas that long,

15:26.982 --> 15:29.115
"For Sale" signs
start to go up.

15:31.986 --> 15:35.421
I take it things didn't
go smoothly with your mom.

15:35.423 --> 15:37.790
No.

15:37.792 --> 15:40.927
I'm not sure how we're going
to get past this.

15:40.929 --> 15:42.128
You know, I...

15:42.130 --> 15:44.797
I sort of went
through something

15:44.799 --> 15:46.599
like this myself.

15:46.601 --> 15:49.268
Howard, we've all seen
your mother naked.

15:51.572 --> 15:53.973
That woman needs to learn
how to tie a robe.

15:53.975 --> 15:57.543
I'm talking about when
my mom started seeing someone

15:57.545 --> 15:59.846
a couple years
after my dad left.

15:59.848 --> 16:02.682
I didn't know she did.

16:02.684 --> 16:06.252
Yeah, she was dating this guy,

16:06.254 --> 16:10.189
and I was kind of a jerk
to her about it.

16:10.191 --> 16:12.458
What did you do?

16:12.460 --> 16:14.527
Well, let's just say
it was the most vicious

16:14.529 --> 16:17.664
bar mitzvah speech in
the history of Temple Beth El.

16:18.632 --> 16:21.834
Anyway, she broke up with him.

16:21.836 --> 16:23.803
And she's basically

16:23.805 --> 16:26.039
been alone ever since.

16:27.174 --> 16:30.677
She never said it,
but I always felt

16:30.679 --> 16:33.880
I was the reason why.

16:33.882 --> 16:34.847
I'm sorry.

16:34.849 --> 16:36.315
Although,
based on your story,

16:36.317 --> 16:40.253
you absolutely
were the reason why.

16:41.188 --> 16:43.356
All I'm saying is
you might not want

16:43.358 --> 16:46.726
to get in the way
of your mom's happiness.

16:48.328 --> 16:50.563
You may have a point.

16:50.565 --> 16:53.399
I love my mother.

16:53.401 --> 16:57.537
Even if she fornicates
like a demonic weasel.

17:01.508 --> 17:04.510
And the healing begins.

17:08.882 --> 17:09.915
Hello.

17:09.917 --> 17:10.950
Hello.

17:10.952 --> 17:12.285
Are you ready to discuss

17:12.287 --> 17:14.020
this calmly, like adults?

17:14.021 --> 17:16.556
I am.

17:28.836 --> 17:32.038
Shelly, I'm sorry that
you saw what you saw.

17:32.040 --> 17:34.373
I know that this
is hard for you.

17:34.375 --> 17:36.709
I think what most upsets me
about it, Mother,

17:36.711 --> 17:38.478
is the hypocrisy.

17:38.480 --> 17:40.446
Doesn't this contradict

17:40.448 --> 17:43.649
all the religious rules you've
been espousing your whole life?

17:43.651 --> 17:45.151
You're right, it does,
and it's something

17:45.153 --> 17:47.453
that I'm struggling
with these days.

17:47.455 --> 17:49.155
Then why are you doing it?

17:49.157 --> 17:51.991
Because I'm not
perfect, Shelly.

17:51.993 --> 17:54.961
And that man's booty is.

18:00.033 --> 18:03.870
Well, this is confusing for me.

18:03.872 --> 18:06.372
But I don't want to stand
in the way of your happiness.

18:06.374 --> 18:08.341
So...

18:08.343 --> 18:11.010
I'll condemn you internally
while maintaining

18:11.012 --> 18:13.946
an outward appearance
of acceptance.

18:15.048 --> 18:18.518
That is very Christian of you.

18:20.788 --> 18:22.722
Mother, if you're going
to conduct your life

18:22.724 --> 18:25.124
in this fashion,
then I should let you know

18:25.126 --> 18:28.294
that the world has changed
since you were a young woman.

18:28.296 --> 18:29.662
You know,
it's not all sock hops,

18:29.664 --> 18:33.466
soda jerks
and segregation anymore.

18:33.468 --> 18:37.036
How old do you think I am?

18:37.038 --> 18:40.706
My point is that you're going
to need to be careful.

18:40.708 --> 18:42.041
You used to be protected

18:42.043 --> 18:44.811
by your pre-Enlightenment
mythology,

18:44.813 --> 18:47.513
but now you're going
to need a stronger friend

18:47.515 --> 18:50.550
named latex.

18:51.752 --> 18:55.755
Are you having the
sex talk with me?

18:55.757 --> 18:57.089
Well, someone has to.

18:57.091 --> 18:59.625
Oh, dear Lord!
Yeah, well...

18:59.627 --> 19:02.195
No, don't look to Him.
He's mad at you right now.

19:12.162 --> 19:13.763
Oh, come on, don't pout.

19:13.765 --> 19:15.465
I'm sorry I ruined your game.

19:15.467 --> 19:17.633
I'm not pouting, I'm brooding.

19:17.635 --> 19:20.837
Which is how sexy men pout.

19:22.406 --> 19:24.173
It actually was kind of fun.

19:24.175 --> 19:25.274
You're just saying that.

19:25.276 --> 19:27.410
Yeah.

19:30.014 --> 19:31.981
I liked the time travel element.

19:31.983 --> 19:34.183
Thank you.
I thought it was inspired.

19:34.185 --> 19:35.952
It was. By <i>Terminator.</i>

19:37.254 --> 19:38.654
Well, I hope 20 years from now,

19:38.656 --> 19:39.856
we really are all still together

19:39.858 --> 19:40.857
and still friends.

19:40.859 --> 19:42.291
Definitely.
Of course.

19:42.293 --> 19:43.626
Well, hey, how about this?

19:43.628 --> 19:46.129
Whether we're friends,
not friends,

19:46.131 --> 19:47.797
scattered around the world,
no matter what,

19:47.799 --> 19:49.932
let's all promise to meet
in front of this building

19:49.934 --> 19:52.235
exactly 20 years
from tonight at 8:00 p.m.

19:52.237 --> 19:53.903
and have dinner
like we always do.

19:53.905 --> 19:55.171
Aw! I love it.

19:55.173 --> 19:56.205
Okay?

19:56.207 --> 19:57.273
Putting it
in my phone right now.

19:57.275 --> 19:58.474
Yeah, me, too.

19:59.777 --> 20:02.078
My phone doesn't
have a calendar.

20:06.383 --> 20:08.618
It's all right, I'll just
write it on my hand.

20:10.854 --> 20:12.955
And it's done.

20:12.957 --> 20:14.290
Yup, we're all in.

20:14.292 --> 20:16.225
All right, I'll see you guys
in 20 years.

20:24.285 --> 20:25.986
I knew it.
