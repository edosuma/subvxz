01:17.318 --> 01:18.685
You nervous?

01:34.702 --> 01:36.536
Jacob?

01:47.815 --> 01:49.880
Jacob, are you hiding?

02:03.363 --> 02:05.029
Jacob?

02:08.668 --> 02:09.735
Hmm.

02:09.737 --> 02:13.372
I wonder where Jacob could be.

02:13.374 --> 02:14.973
Hey!

02:14.975 --> 02:18.142
- I got you.
- Yeah, you got me.

02:18.144 --> 02:21.513
What are you doing up in the attic? You
know you're not supposed to be up here.

02:21.515 --> 02:23.581
I, um, was hiding.

02:23.583 --> 02:25.616
Yeah. Well, why don't
we get your best-man clothes on

02:25.618 --> 02:27.753
- so we can get this show on the road.
- No thank you.

02:27.755 --> 02:30.055
Whoa!

02:30.057 --> 02:32.758
Hey, hey, hey. The sooner
we get this over with,

02:32.760 --> 02:35.063
the sooner we can
all have cake.

02:36.397 --> 02:38.930
I don't wanna wear the tie.

02:38.932 --> 02:40.398
You're gonna look
really good with the tie on.

02:40.400 --> 02:41.699
You're gonna look like me.

02:41.701 --> 02:45.771
Then I want two...

02:45.773 --> 02:47.572
- pieces of cake.
- Deal.

02:47.574 --> 02:53.912
And I want a real train set,
with lights, bridges and houses.

02:53.914 --> 02:55.947
You drive a hard bargain.

02:55.949 --> 02:58.849
Let's go get married.

02:58.851 --> 03:03.054
And now, Mark and Elizabeth
will recite their vows.

03:03.056 --> 03:05.657
No pressure, just pretend
like we're not here.

03:07.761 --> 03:10.865
I, uh...

03:12.632 --> 03:15.499
Uh, summer before law school

03:15.501 --> 03:20.771
I spent half my financial-aid
money on a really expensive bike,

03:20.773 --> 03:24.475
and then I crashed it
in some middle-of-nowhere trail,

03:24.477 --> 03:26.812
but was lucky,

03:26.814 --> 03:30.681
because there was this beautiful
girl out hiking that day.

03:30.683 --> 03:34.618
- Me.
- And she gave me her whole pack of Life Savers.

03:35.988 --> 03:37.858
And kissed me...

03:38.892 --> 03:40.728
to take my mind
off the pain.

03:43.564 --> 03:45.764
Thank you
for saving my life.

03:45.766 --> 03:49.166
I vow to make it up
to you every day.

03:49.168 --> 03:51.703
I was kinda hoping you'd vow
to fix up this house.

03:51.705 --> 03:54.708
Yeah, all right. I'll do that, too.

03:56.243 --> 03:58.679
- And Elizabeth.
- Oh.

04:00.247 --> 04:01.749
Hold that.

04:02.516 --> 04:04.816
We had, um,
eight years,

04:04.818 --> 04:08.118
one child,
one unrealized dream house,

04:08.120 --> 04:10.955
your law school, and my MFA to think
about this whole marriage thing,

04:10.957 --> 04:15.259
and now I don't know
why it took us so long,

04:15.261 --> 04:17.598
because there is no me
without you.

04:19.699 --> 04:21.266
Is that it?
Are we married?

04:21.267 --> 04:22.533
Ring.

04:22.535 --> 04:25.138
- OK.
- All right?

04:27.508 --> 04:28.609
Thank you.

04:35.883 --> 04:37.785
OK.

04:44.223 --> 04:46.624
- And now, by the power vested in me
- It fits.

04:46.626 --> 04:49.961
- by the Church of Universal Life and the Internet,
- Come here.

04:49.963 --> 04:52.596
I finally pronounce you
husband and wife,

04:52.598 --> 04:54.031
and you're already kissing the bride,

04:54.033 --> 04:56.167
So my work here is done.

04:56.169 --> 04:57.836
Time for cake!

04:57.838 --> 04:59.207
Cake!

06:17.884 --> 06:19.216
Time for the honeymoon?

06:19.218 --> 06:22.155
Yeah, it's time
for the honeymoon.

08:45.165 --> 08:46.931
It's parent-teacher
conference day

08:46.933 --> 08:48.866
and I-I totally
missed the memo.

08:48.868 --> 08:50.368
But my sister's on
her way in to get them.

08:50.370 --> 08:52.903
- So...
- Guys.

08:54.306 --> 08:55.405
Is that my monkey?

08:55.407 --> 09:00.077
Um, Riley, we don't take
things that are not ours, OK?

09:00.079 --> 09:04.982
That-that belongs to Mr. Bennett,
so let's please bring it inside.

09:04.984 --> 09:06.953
Go on.

09:16.463 --> 09:17.932
Thank you.

09:20.967 --> 09:23.504
Sorry about that.
That's good, thank you.

09:35.448 --> 09:38.515
Hi, Dad.

09:38.517 --> 09:41.451
It's me. It's Mark.

09:41.453 --> 09:45.889
I know. I know
my own son when I see him.

09:45.891 --> 09:47.524
Why you eating this crap?

09:47.526 --> 09:49.894
It's all sugar.

09:49.896 --> 09:51.929
I thought you moved away.

09:51.931 --> 09:53.965
I did, Chicago.

09:53.967 --> 09:58.068
But I'm back.
Been back a year.

09:58.070 --> 10:02.407
- How you doin'?
- I'm up for a promotion. Head of the department.

10:02.409 --> 10:05.210
Not sure I'm gonna take it,
obviously.

10:05.212 --> 10:08.178
I don't know if I wanna
manage a whole department.

10:08.180 --> 10:10.181
You're retired, Dad.

10:10.183 --> 10:12.417
You don't have to manage anything.

10:12.419 --> 10:14.985
That woman looks
just like Elizabeth.

10:14.987 --> 10:16.387
<i>Up next,
author Elizabeth Wells</i>

10:16.389 --> 10:18.022
<i>celebrating a remarkable year</i>

10:18.024 --> 10:20.158
- <i>on the bestseller list...</i>
- It is Elizabeth.

10:20.160 --> 10:21.426
...Upwelling:
A Year By The Sea.

10:21.428 --> 10:23.595
<i>Now, Elizabeth,
are you surprised...</i>

10:23.597 --> 10:25.096
What's she doin' on TV?

10:25.098 --> 10:28.398
- She wrote a book.
- Well, that's wonderful.

10:28.400 --> 10:31.001
How is she?

10:31.003 --> 10:33.006
We're divorced, Dad.

10:34.907 --> 10:37.010
We've been divorced
for six years.

10:38.444 --> 10:41.512
I hope you're not letting her
raise that boy all alone,

10:41.514 --> 10:44.081
because a boy
needs his father.

10:44.083 --> 10:46.386
Jacob's dead.

10:47.953 --> 10:49.556
Seven years.

10:51.123 --> 10:52.859
Seven years ago today.

11:01.067 --> 11:02.499
Hey, Gary, what's up?

11:02.501 --> 11:04.067
<i>Hey, buddy,
how's it goin'?</i>

11:04.069 --> 11:05.937
<i>Uh, look, I got
some bad news for you.</i>

11:05.939 --> 11:08.005
<i>Your tenants moved out
in the middle of the night</i>

11:08.007 --> 11:10.475
<i>and managed to trash the place
before they went.</i>

11:10.477 --> 11:11.442
They just moved in.

11:11.444 --> 11:12.911
Gary, what is so hard

11:12.913 --> 11:14.645
about finding a nice,
long-term tenant?

11:14.647 --> 11:18.249
<i>What can I say? People are pigs.
Do you want me to list it again?</i>

11:18.251 --> 11:20.920
<i>I can get a crew
in there to clean up.</i>

11:22.488 --> 11:24.522
- Sell it.
- <i>You sure?</i>

11:24.524 --> 11:27.991
Let me stop by, pick up
some stuff out of the attic.

11:27.993 --> 11:29.562
I'll call you when I'm done.

11:55.988 --> 11:57.989
- Ow.
- Shoot!

11:57.991 --> 12:02.527
Hey! Hey.

12:02.529 --> 12:04.629
- What? What is going on?
- Oh!

12:04.631 --> 12:08.166
Huh?
Oh, my God! Are you OK?

12:08.168 --> 12:11.735
I'm so sorry.
I promised to take him fishing.

12:11.737 --> 12:13.604
- It's totally my fault...
- That's not a toy.

12:13.606 --> 12:15.572
Can I get you a Band-Aid?

12:15.574 --> 12:18.176
Have you had a tetanus shot
in the last ten years?

12:18.178 --> 12:20.179
You might wanna get
a tetanus shot.

15:42.748 --> 15:45.316
Peggy!

15:45.318 --> 15:47.652
- Peg?
- What?

15:47.654 --> 15:50.421
Hey. Uh, is Peggy around?

15:50.423 --> 15:52.322
No. Peggy is not around.
Who are you?

15:52.324 --> 15:55.592
I'm Janice.
I come in peace.

15:55.594 --> 15:56.927
You know when she'll be back?

15:56.929 --> 15:58.828
Never, by the look of things.

15:58.830 --> 16:00.664
She and her boyfriend, Steve,

16:00.666 --> 16:02.933
trashed the place and
skipped out on the rent.

16:02.935 --> 16:04.835
- Are you the landlord?
- Owner.

16:04.837 --> 16:07.304
You know where I can find
Peggy and Steve?

16:07.306 --> 16:09.740
No. I had their number
in my phone

16:09.742 --> 16:12.610
but it bricked when I tried
to upgrade my operating system,

16:12.612 --> 16:13.911
that is why I stopped by.

16:13.913 --> 16:16.246
All right.
Good night.

16:16.248 --> 16:20.784
Well, is everything, um...
OK? You know, with the house?

16:20.786 --> 16:22.586
Why?

16:22.588 --> 16:26.456
Well, you said it was trashed, and
I noticed the broken windows.

16:26.458 --> 16:28.558
What can I say?
People are pigs.

16:28.560 --> 16:32.363
Yeah, well, just in case
you need to reach me,

16:32.365 --> 16:34.631
here's my card.

16:34.633 --> 16:36.634
I'm a medium.

16:36.636 --> 16:39.903
I was doing some consulting
for Peggy and Steve, you know.

16:39.905 --> 16:43.407
So if you feel like
you need some consulting,

16:43.409 --> 16:45.375
- then you know where to reach me.
- Great.

16:45.377 --> 16:47.979
I also walk dogs.
You got dogs?

16:47.981 --> 16:49.746
No dogs.
Good night.

16:49.748 --> 16:51.282
Hey...

16:51.284 --> 16:52.718
Good night.

16:55.554 --> 16:57.355
<i>You've reached
Elizabeth Wells,</i>

16:57.357 --> 16:59.456
<i>please leave a message
and I'll return your call.</i>

16:59.458 --> 17:01.558
Uh, hi.

17:01.560 --> 17:04.028
Um, Elizabeth, Mark here.

17:04.030 --> 17:06.797
I wanted to let you know that
I'm finally selling the house.

17:06.799 --> 17:09.467
Uh, there's a lot of stuff
up in the attic.

17:09.469 --> 17:12.002
Uh, figured you might
want some of it.

17:12.003 --> 17:14.605
So why don't you call me back
on this number, and...

Mark, I've been trying
to call you.

20:44.884 --> 20:46.916
- What...
- My phone is dead.

20:46.918 --> 20:48.919
- And there are some pictures on here that I need.
- All right.

20:48.921 --> 20:51.055
I will take care of it.
I'm sure it won't be a problem.

20:51.057 --> 20:53.057
Listen... No, no, no.
Don't go in there yet.

20:53.059 --> 20:55.259
Kate's in the conference room
with everyone already, OK?

20:55.261 --> 20:59.933
They've been waiting for you.
Mark, are you all right?

21:01.032 --> 21:03.703
OK. Um...

21:04.569 --> 21:06.569
Here.

21:06.571 --> 21:07.938
Eat these.

21:07.940 --> 21:11.509
I'll tell 'em
you'll be right in, OK?

21:11.511 --> 21:13.978
We know your project
is on an accelerated schedule

21:13.980 --> 21:16.247
with extensive
environmental issues.

21:16.249 --> 21:18.682
Our firm is prepared to
represent your interests

21:18.684 --> 21:21.285
at every level of local
and state government.

21:21.287 --> 21:23.287
Mark actually has a lot of
expertise in the area,

21:23.289 --> 21:25.556
he used to counsel
the other side.

21:25.558 --> 21:26.690
Mark?

21:28.994 --> 21:31.731
Mark?

21:45.278 --> 21:47.243
Hey, new phone.

21:47.245 --> 21:48.746
They couldn't bring
your old one back to life,

21:48.748 --> 21:50.847
but they recovered
all your data.

21:50.849 --> 21:53.086
Thank you.

21:54.020 --> 21:56.223
Y-you're welcome

22:45.937 --> 22:49.205
Thanks for those Goldfish,
and the Band-Aids.

22:49.207 --> 22:50.974
How is your shoulder?
Are you OK?

22:50.976 --> 22:53.644
Listen, I would appreciate it

22:53.646 --> 22:55.980
if you asked your kid not
to play in my house anymore.

22:55.982 --> 22:59.249
- Dash? In your house?
- Yeah.

22:59.251 --> 23:03.153
No, no.
He... he stays here.

23:03.155 --> 23:05.055
Sometimes he plays
out in the yard, but...

23:05.057 --> 23:08.028
Well, someone was running around
in my attic last night.

23:09.995 --> 23:12.898
Um, maybe you have rats.

24:46.392 --> 24:48.128
Where's Mommy?

24:50.261 --> 24:51.931
Where's Mommy?

25:30.301 --> 25:33.136
- Elizabeth.
- Mm-hmm?

25:33.138 --> 25:35.806
- Someone's here.
- Hmm?

25:35.808 --> 25:37.508
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Mark.

25:37.510 --> 25:40.246
- I, uh... I called you.
- Wow. Um...

25:41.113 --> 25:42.813
Hi.

25:42.815 --> 25:44.080
Did you get my messages?

25:44.082 --> 25:46.215
I'm not sure.
I've just... I've been, um...

25:46.217 --> 25:47.384
Who is he?

25:47.386 --> 25:48.786
Oh, um...

25:48.788 --> 25:51.024
Emma, Isabelle,
this is my friend, Mark.

25:54.059 --> 25:56.026
- OK... OK.
- Just five minutes.

25:56.028 --> 25:57.560
I'm gonna go over there.
Will you stay with Marta?

25:57.562 --> 25:59.262
Come, <i>niñas.</i>

25:59.264 --> 26:02.332
If it's about the house,
you don't need my permission.

26:02.334 --> 26:04.134
I need to talk to you.

26:04.136 --> 26:05.803
Look, I don't really
have time to chat.

26:05.805 --> 26:07.104
It's your house now,
you bought me out.

26:07.106 --> 26:10.106
I need you to
come out there with me.

26:10.108 --> 26:12.175
I-I'm busy, Mark.

26:12.177 --> 26:14.310
I-I'm working.
I have a deadline.

26:14.312 --> 26:16.413
- I have the girls.
- It's important.

26:16.415 --> 26:18.882
Elizabeth, it's about Jacob.

26:18.884 --> 26:23.287
I don't need things to remind me of my son.

26:23.289 --> 26:25.288
It's been six years.

26:25.290 --> 26:27.825
- I don't ask you for anything.
- OK.

26:27.827 --> 26:30.126
Um, obviously there's something
going on with you.

26:30.128 --> 26:32.261
Whatever it is,
I-I hope it works out.

26:32.263 --> 26:33.564
Sell the house or
don't sell the house,

26:33.566 --> 26:35.835
you do whatever
you need to do, OK?

26:37.368 --> 26:39.204
Goodbye, Mark.

26:41.106 --> 26:43.108
Girls, are you almost
ready for lunch?

26:46.878 --> 26:48.481
Jacob?

26:53.385 --> 26:55.555
I tried.

26:56.521 --> 26:58.558
But your Mommy's...

27:00.425 --> 27:02.326
on a trip.

27:02.328 --> 27:04.294
So she can't see you right now,

27:04.296 --> 27:08.265
but... she told me
to bring you a present.

27:08.267 --> 27:10.403
You wanna see it?

27:11.569 --> 27:13.373
Army men.

27:14.973 --> 27:17.607
You always wanted army men,
but...

27:17.609 --> 27:20.877
we never let you have them
because they're violent,

27:20.879 --> 27:23.980
and barbaric, and
probably toxic, but...

27:23.982 --> 27:26.919
all that seems
pretty stupid now, so...

27:30.588 --> 27:33.123
Army men.

27:36.395 --> 27:38.530
All right, Mr. Bananas...

27:39.530 --> 27:41.434
it's me or you.

27:50.475 --> 27:53.210
Stress.

27:53.212 --> 27:56.980
Early-onset dementia.

27:56.982 --> 28:01.384
Accidental mescaline ingestion.

28:01.386 --> 28:04.323
Drunk. You're drunk.

28:18.604 --> 28:20.604
I lied.
I want the stuff.

28:20.606 --> 28:23.009
Cool. Good.

28:24.376 --> 28:25.578
Come in.

28:28.012 --> 28:30.681
Um... you want a drink?

28:30.683 --> 28:33.386
Nice army men.

28:34.586 --> 28:36.219
Uh...

28:36.221 --> 28:37.287
Thank you.

28:37.289 --> 28:39.492
I thought
you stopped drinking.

28:40.559 --> 28:43.262
I did, mostly.

28:44.495 --> 28:46.565
Mostly...

28:47.499 --> 28:49.001
I did.

28:52.637 --> 28:55.471
I just want the stuff,
Mark.

28:55.473 --> 28:57.676
Is this it? Did you already
take what you wanted?

28:59.310 --> 29:01.246
Yeah.

29:08.052 --> 29:11.323
- I gotta show you something.
- What are you doing?

29:12.424 --> 29:15.295
- I gotta show you this.
- Mark.

29:16.427 --> 29:18.260
Mark, stop it!

29:19.697 --> 29:21.501
Boo!

29:25.570 --> 29:29.442
Boo, Mommy!

29:35.246 --> 29:37.213
Wait! That was him!

29:37.215 --> 29:40.517
Elizabeth!
That-that was Jacob.

29:40.519 --> 29:42.786
Hey, he was there!

29:42.788 --> 29:44.156
You didn't see him?

29:48.426 --> 29:50.996
You're sick, Mark.
You get yourself some help.

30:32.070 --> 30:34.374
Jacob.

30:51.757 --> 30:53.359
Hey.

30:55.828 --> 31:00.463
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:00.465 --> 31:02.432
I know I'm not supposed
to be in your house,

31:02.434 --> 31:03.866
but the door
was wide open.

31:03.868 --> 31:05.669
And I wanted to see
if you were dead.

31:12.478 --> 31:14.313
Thanks.

31:27.326 --> 31:30.126
She hit you really hard.

31:30.128 --> 31:31.627
I'll live.

31:31.629 --> 31:34.131
Keep your hands up in front
of your face, like this,

31:34.133 --> 31:35.731
if she wants to fight again.

31:35.733 --> 31:37.701
Who taught you that?

31:37.703 --> 31:41.238
My taekwondo teacher.

31:41.240 --> 31:43.108
It's a good tip.

31:44.276 --> 31:45.842
Is she your girlfriend?

31:45.844 --> 31:49.546
My wife.
We're divorced.

31:49.548 --> 31:51.448
My parents are divorced.

31:51.450 --> 31:54.317
I don't see my dad.
He doesn't like kids.

31:54.319 --> 31:55.719
I'm sure that's not true.

31:55.721 --> 31:57.621
I don't think
you like kids either.

31:57.623 --> 31:59.655
I like kids.

31:59.657 --> 32:01.924
Why don't you have any?

32:01.926 --> 32:04.129
I did.

32:06.298 --> 32:08.201
I had a son.

32:10.501 --> 32:12.405
He died when he was five.

32:13.371 --> 32:15.505
My cat died last year.

32:15.507 --> 32:17.740
He had eye cancer.

32:17.742 --> 32:20.245
What happened to your son?

32:31.589 --> 32:33.326
Car crash.

32:35.626 --> 32:39.628
It was raining,
I swerved,

32:39.630 --> 32:43.768
he was thrown from his booster
seat and his head hit the glass.

32:46.471 --> 32:48.641
It happened fast.

32:51.309 --> 32:52.942
I always wear my seatbelt.

32:52.944 --> 32:56.313
Even on the school bus. All the
other kids make fun of me.

32:56.315 --> 32:57.446
Fuck 'em.

33:01.419 --> 33:02.952
Dash!
Time for school.

33:02.954 --> 33:06.291
OK, don't-don't tell
my mom I'm here!

33:09.761 --> 33:13.797
So, uh, you're a dog walker
slash medium, huh?

33:13.799 --> 33:15.932
I walk dogs on the side.

33:15.934 --> 33:18.535
It's good money,
it's steady work.

33:18.537 --> 33:22.638
Plus, dogs are awesome,
unlike people.

33:25.676 --> 33:27.280
So what's goin' on?

33:28.746 --> 33:31.448
I saw my dead son
in the house.

33:31.450 --> 33:34.651
You saw him?

33:34.653 --> 33:37.519
- You didn't conjure him, did you?
- No.

33:37.521 --> 33:40.457
You have a brain tumor or some
other terminal condition?

33:40.459 --> 33:42.892
Not that I'm aware of,
no.

33:42.894 --> 33:44.994
Family history
of mental illness?

33:44.996 --> 33:47.564
My father has dementia.

33:47.566 --> 33:51.934
Technically that's a cognitive
disorder, not a mental illness, so...

33:53.972 --> 33:56.573
What did he want?
Wh-what did you talk about?

33:56.575 --> 34:01.544
It wasn't exactly a
conversation, but, uh...

34:01.546 --> 34:02.912
He wants his mother.

34:02.914 --> 34:06.519
Oh.
Well, bring her to him.

34:07.319 --> 34:09.420
I tried, and, um...

34:10.321 --> 34:12.855
she didn't believe it was him.

34:16.495 --> 34:18.328
Then I guess it's up to you.

34:18.330 --> 34:19.995
What is up to me?

34:19.996 --> 34:22.364
Your son is dead.

34:22.367 --> 34:25.000
So what is he doing here,
in the land of the living?

34:25.002 --> 34:29.406
Maybe he's lost, maybe
he has some unfinished business.

34:29.408 --> 34:31.741
What kind of unfinished business
could a five-year-old have?

34:31.743 --> 34:34.777
How should I know?
I'm not a child psychiatrist.

34:34.780 --> 34:37.984
The point is he needs you
to help him move on.

34:40.484 --> 34:42.650
What if I don't want him
to move on?

34:42.652 --> 34:44.520
Your son does not
belong here.

34:44.522 --> 34:47.991
He's lost, and
he needs something from you.

34:47.993 --> 34:52.529
You need to ask him
what he wants, be direct,

34:52.531 --> 34:55.034
and then give it to him.

34:57.635 --> 34:59.604
OK.

35:00.339 --> 35:02.475
Good luck.

35:13.818 --> 35:15.884
Hey.

35:15.886 --> 35:18.624
My room's all back.

35:19.624 --> 35:21.526
My fort!

35:36.874 --> 35:39.444
You made this train.

35:40.511 --> 35:41.944
I remember.

35:41.946 --> 35:43.546
I stayed up all night sanding it

35:43.548 --> 35:45.651
so I could give it to you
on your birthday.

35:48.486 --> 35:50.588
Can I ask you something?

35:51.122 --> 35:52.955
OK.

35:52.957 --> 35:56.024
Do you know why you're here?

35:56.026 --> 35:58.530
I lived here.

36:00.499 --> 36:03.566
Do you need
something from me?

36:03.568 --> 36:06.169
You promised me

36:06.171 --> 36:08.571
you would get me
a real train set,

36:08.573 --> 36:14.176
that runs by itself, with bridges,
lights, and little houses.

36:14.178 --> 36:16.879
- I did?
- At the wedding.

36:16.881 --> 36:20.015
That rings a bell.

36:20.017 --> 36:23.021
When's Mommy coming back?

36:24.955 --> 36:26.723
Hey.

36:26.725 --> 36:30.493
It might just be
you and me for a while, buddy.

36:30.495 --> 36:32.761
Mommy can't see you
like I can.

36:32.763 --> 36:36.736
Yes, she can.
She's just afraid.

36:58.756 --> 37:01.591
- I just wanna talk.
- Talk to a shrink.

37:01.593 --> 37:03.593
Please come back
to the house with me.

37:03.595 --> 37:06.229
You don't believe in God,
now you believe in ghosts?

37:06.231 --> 37:08.564
He says you knew
it was him.

37:08.566 --> 37:09.999
You were drunk.

37:10.001 --> 37:11.734
But you weren't.

37:11.736 --> 37:14.203
I can't explain it.
I don't know why he's here.

37:14.205 --> 37:16.038
But he is.

37:16.040 --> 37:19.077
And he's asking for you.

37:36.127 --> 37:38.464
You can't touch him.

38:23.307 --> 38:25.008
Mommy!

38:25.010 --> 38:27.245
I knew you'd come.

38:29.080 --> 38:31.548
Elizabeth,
you can't touch him.

38:50.935 --> 38:53.071
How is this possible?

38:59.778 --> 39:00.977
Again?

39:00.979 --> 39:03.345
- What?
- Again?

39:03.347 --> 39:05.884
- Yeah.
- OK.

39:34.713 --> 39:36.147
I don't understand.

39:39.283 --> 39:43.051
I mean, what?

39:43.053 --> 39:45.020
I know.

39:46.758 --> 39:49.227
He's got his little tooth,
he never...

39:50.928 --> 39:52.328
He never lost his tooth.

39:52.330 --> 39:55.163
Yeah, he's got
that sweet tooth.

39:55.165 --> 39:57.165
Oh, my God.

39:57.167 --> 39:59.102
He's so funny,
isn't he?

39:59.104 --> 40:01.770
He is. Yeah, he is.

40:04.376 --> 40:07.343
I guess I'll, um...

40:07.345 --> 40:11.149
get some stuff and
come back in the morning.

40:12.651 --> 40:15.084
I'm, uh, I'm gonna...

40:15.086 --> 40:17.986
I'm gonna tell Smith that I need
an office outside the house,

40:17.988 --> 40:21.223
and I'm-I'm working on
a follow-up to my book, so...

40:21.225 --> 40:23.426
um, so maybe we can switch off.

40:23.428 --> 40:25.995
I can-I can take the days, since
you have to go to the office,

40:25.997 --> 40:28.600
and you can have the nights
and the weekends, OK?

40:30.167 --> 40:32.003
OK.

40:39.910 --> 40:41.076
What else should we make?

40:41.078 --> 40:43.712
- Rocket ship.
- Rocket ship?

40:43.714 --> 40:46.915
- Yep, rocket ship.
- Rocket ship it is.

40:46.917 --> 40:49.017
OK, here it comes.

40:51.289 --> 40:54.089
OK, there's the-that part.

40:56.026 --> 40:57.225
The jets.

40:57.227 --> 40:59.227
Now we need some fire
at the bottom.

40:59.229 --> 41:01.863
- OK.
- And some boosters.

41:01.865 --> 41:04.033
Some boosters.
OK.

41:04.035 --> 41:05.401
What do you think?

41:05.403 --> 41:08.136
It looks more like
a popsicle.

41:13.278 --> 41:16.779
- I was gone for a few days.
- Five days.

41:16.781 --> 41:19.948
120 billable hours.

41:19.950 --> 41:21.686
So what's going on?

41:23.722 --> 41:26.888
You've been with us
for how long, six years now?

41:26.890 --> 41:30.058
Three different cities.
You're a machine.

41:30.060 --> 41:31.761
I love that.

41:31.763 --> 41:34.199
But I have to be able
to depend on you.

41:37.468 --> 41:39.334
- <i>How did it go today?</i>
- <i>Good.</i>

41:39.336 --> 41:40.970
He was really good.

41:40.972 --> 41:42.337
So you taking off?

41:42.339 --> 41:43.975
Yeah.
I'll see you tomorrow.

41:47.912 --> 41:52.017
You used to make monsters
on the wall with your hands.

41:53.383 --> 41:55.752
Like this?

41:55.754 --> 41:57.819
Woof, woof!

42:00.758 --> 42:05.361
Here's my two-mouthed bull dog.

42:39.997 --> 42:41.531
Hello?

42:46.537 --> 42:48.171
Mark?

42:48.173 --> 42:49.305
You're supposed
to be at work.

42:49.307 --> 42:52.174
- I quit.
- You quit?

42:52.176 --> 42:55.410
So, what, you're just
planning to...

42:55.412 --> 42:57.312
Spend some time here.

42:57.314 --> 43:00.452
As long as he's here,
I'm gonna be with him.

43:02.153 --> 43:04.319
What's, uh,
what's goin' on up there?

43:04.321 --> 43:06.191
What's he up to today?

43:09.426 --> 43:13.261
What's the problem? Can't stand
to be in the same house with me?

43:13.263 --> 43:16.899
I need time.
That's the problem.

43:16.901 --> 43:18.433
You don't get to take him
away from me again.

43:18.435 --> 43:20.136
I'm not taking him away.
What are you talking about?

43:20.138 --> 43:22.037
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

43:22.039 --> 43:24.607
You took him away from me.
You wouldn't talk about him.

43:24.609 --> 43:27.276
You put away his pictures. You
wouldn't celebrate his birthday.

43:27.278 --> 43:29.044
- Because he was gone.
- You put everything

43:29.046 --> 43:30.513
into a little box and
you wouldn't let me in.

43:30.515 --> 43:32.915
You forgot him.
You just sat in your chair

43:32.917 --> 43:35.319
and drank your whiskey
and you forgot everything.

43:37.388 --> 43:38.620
I didn't forget.

43:38.622 --> 43:41.957
- You left me all alone.
- No. That was you.

43:41.959 --> 43:43.292
You're the one who left.

43:43.294 --> 43:45.060
You walked out that door
and never came back.

43:45.062 --> 43:47.263
Because I didn't wanna watch you
drown yourself in denial.

43:47.265 --> 43:48.997
But I didn't drown, did I?

43:48.999 --> 43:52.067
Maybe it wasn't pretty
and spiritual and poetic,

43:52.069 --> 43:53.636
but I got through just fine.

43:53.638 --> 43:55.604
You wanted to punish me,
you still do.

43:55.606 --> 43:57.573
- What are you talking about?
- It wasn't my fault!

43:57.575 --> 43:59.341
- So it was my fault?
- Yes!

43:59.343 --> 44:01.877
- Because I swerved for a dog.
- You were driving too fast!

44:01.879 --> 44:04.913
- It was raining!
- Well, you should've hit the goddamn dog!

44:04.915 --> 44:07.649
How hard is it to buckle
a goddamn seatbelt?

44:28.406 --> 44:31.176
I want it to be like before.

44:33.678 --> 44:36.044
- OK.
- OK.

44:36.046 --> 44:37.312
We'll clean it up.

44:37.314 --> 44:40.586
No. I want you
to be like before.

44:44.254 --> 44:45.923
Hold hands.

44:55.265 --> 44:57.635
Now you could
read me a story.

45:05.475 --> 45:07.709
"No sooner had Pinocchio
got into bed,

45:07.711 --> 45:11.046
then he fell asleep at once
and began to dream.

45:11.048 --> 45:14.049
And he dreamt that he was
in the middle of a field,

45:14.051 --> 45:18.955
and the field was full of vines
covered with clusters of gold coins.

45:18.957 --> 45:23.158
And as they swung in the wind,
they went, 'zin, zin, zin, '

45:23.160 --> 45:26.595
almost as if they would say, 'Let
who will come and take us.'"

45:26.597 --> 45:29.966
- OK.
- OK?

45:29.968 --> 45:32.069
That's enough.

45:55.993 --> 45:58.426
- How'd you get cut?
- Hmm?

45:58.428 --> 45:59.564
Your neck is cut.

46:08.772 --> 46:11.209
God, I loved this house.

46:12.642 --> 46:14.009
Me too.

46:14.011 --> 46:15.243
Oh, come on.
No, you didn't.

46:15.245 --> 46:17.014
You hated this house.

46:17.682 --> 46:19.450
You're wrong.

46:22.452 --> 46:25.156
I just felt bad
that I never fixed it up.

46:31.361 --> 46:33.763
I'm sorry.

46:33.765 --> 46:36.765
I didn't wanna leave.

46:36.767 --> 46:40.071
I just felt like
I didn't have a choice.

46:44.475 --> 46:46.310
Truce?

46:47.178 --> 46:49.181
Truce.

46:52.783 --> 46:54.549
<i>♪ No more sleeping ♪</i>

46:54.551 --> 46:59.120
<i>♪ Time to get up,
Time to get up ♪</i>

46:59.122 --> 47:01.624
Oh, hey.

47:01.626 --> 47:04.459
Monkey, no jumping.

47:04.461 --> 47:06.127
Why not?

47:08.832 --> 47:11.734
You're right.
Why not jump on the bed?

47:11.736 --> 47:14.136
Maybe we should both
jump on the bed.

47:14.138 --> 47:15.837
Why don't we both
jump on the bed?

47:15.839 --> 47:18.774
No, you're too big!

47:18.776 --> 47:21.109
- You're gonna break it.
- Yeah, you're right.

47:21.111 --> 47:23.578
Good call.

47:23.580 --> 47:25.580
- Hey, buddy.
- What?

47:25.582 --> 47:27.616
Yesterday,
did you do that?

47:27.618 --> 47:30.255
Did you break the glass
and throw the toys?

47:31.823 --> 47:33.823
You can't do that
anymore.

47:33.825 --> 47:36.428
It's dangerous.
Someone could get hurt.

47:37.727 --> 47:39.727
You shouldn't fight.

47:39.729 --> 47:41.532
We're working on it.

47:42.533 --> 47:45.533
I'm serious, Jacob.
No more wigouts, OK?

47:45.535 --> 47:47.502
OK.

47:47.504 --> 47:49.508
I pushed the button.

47:50.408 --> 47:52.707
It's OK.

47:52.709 --> 47:54.678
Just don't do it again.

47:55.680 --> 47:58.580
- Rematch!
- Whoa! Whoa!

47:58.582 --> 48:00.850
Whoa, whoa!

48:00.852 --> 48:04.289
Rematch!

48:05.689 --> 48:07.823
- Oh, my God!
- What's up?

48:07.825 --> 48:10.392
I started this list
before he was born.

48:10.394 --> 48:12.361
All the things
I wanted to do with him.

48:12.363 --> 48:16.464
- I thought I lost it.
- Hmm.

48:16.466 --> 48:17.732
"Ride a cable car.

48:17.734 --> 48:19.502
Watch shooting stars
from the desert.

48:19.504 --> 48:22.738
Hike to Yosemite Falls. Teach
him to make sun catchers.

48:22.740 --> 48:25.441
Watch the sun go down over the
ocean and see the green flash,"

48:25.443 --> 48:28.213
which somebody told me was blue
because he's colorblind.

48:29.479 --> 48:32.483
- Wow.
- It's long.

48:32.917 --> 48:34.482
Mm.

48:34.484 --> 48:36.588
I thought we had more time.

48:41.425 --> 48:42.390
Where do you want it,
here?

48:42.392 --> 48:45.160
Uh, how 'bout the top?

48:45.162 --> 48:47.428
You know, my mom and I
used to make sun catchers

48:47.430 --> 48:50.232
when I was your age. You probably
don't remember your grandma.

48:50.234 --> 48:52.368
You were so little
when she died.

48:52.370 --> 48:55.373
- I know, when I was just a baby.
- You were.

48:55.939 --> 48:57.238
- Nice.
- Yeah.

48:57.240 --> 48:58.640
I think that's good,

48:58.642 --> 49:02.544
- except for one finishing touch.
- OK.

49:02.546 --> 49:04.446
All right.
What do you think? Good?

49:04.448 --> 49:06.785
- It's perfect.
- Perfect.

49:07.952 --> 49:11.220
- I pushed the button.
- Yes, you did.

49:11.222 --> 49:14.522
Yeah. Bake.
Should we set the timer?

49:14.524 --> 49:17.493
OK. Where is the timer?

49:25.970 --> 49:29.674
We don't have everything in stock,
but I can order anything you see.

49:30.675 --> 49:32.410
I'll take the whole set.

49:37.647 --> 49:40.515
Daddy went to buy me
a real train set

49:40.517 --> 49:42.785
with lights and houses.

49:42.787 --> 49:44.886
I don't know anything
about real trains,

49:44.888 --> 49:46.622
that's between you and Daddy.

49:46.624 --> 49:49.258
Hey, which blue do you like?

49:49.260 --> 49:52.595
Do you like Pale Winter Dreams
or Arctic Adventure?

49:56.399 --> 49:58.869
Maybe Blueberry Crush.
What do you think?

50:01.872 --> 50:02.937
You OK?

50:05.876 --> 50:07.778
Mark?

50:11.448 --> 50:13.885
Stay right here, OK?

50:33.703 --> 50:36.904
There was someone
or something in the house.

50:36.906 --> 50:38.607
Did you see anything?

50:38.609 --> 50:41.442
- No.
- Whoa, Elizabeth.

50:41.444 --> 50:43.678
- What?
- You-you blew a gasket.

50:43.680 --> 50:45.848
- What?
- Your nose.

50:45.850 --> 50:47.649
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

50:47.651 --> 50:49.287
Oh, shit.

50:53.323 --> 50:55.624
Was I supposed to buy the
kind of paint without the lead?

50:55.626 --> 50:57.725
You're not supposed to eat it.

51:02.999 --> 51:07.438
I just want
to hold him, you know?

51:11.075 --> 51:14.042
His skin was so soft
and he was always so warm,

51:14.044 --> 51:15.576
even in the winter.

51:15.578 --> 51:18.482
Like a little furnace.

51:20.718 --> 51:22.787
I need him to stay.

51:27.024 --> 51:31.560
How come she doesn't sleep here at night?

51:31.562 --> 51:33.729
What am I,
chopped liver?

51:33.731 --> 51:36.098
You're chopped
monkey guts.

51:36.100 --> 51:38.466
You're chopped
mealy worms.

51:38.468 --> 51:41.606
You're chopped
orc brains.

51:44.008 --> 51:47.011
She has the other kids now.

51:48.379 --> 51:50.578
Yeah, she does.

51:50.580 --> 51:52.416
But she loves you.

51:53.117 --> 51:54.685
Very much.

51:56.854 --> 51:58.687
She loves you, too.

51:58.689 --> 52:00.625
She just forgot.

52:10.133 --> 52:11.735
Elizabeth?

52:12.870 --> 52:14.705
I can't sleep.

52:21.511 --> 52:23.481
Let's get you in here.

52:25.950 --> 52:27.549
Is Daddy home?

52:27.551 --> 52:29.888
He'll be home soon.
OK?

52:32.856 --> 52:34.723
You wanna see
what I was looking at?

52:34.725 --> 52:35.927
Yes.

52:37.127 --> 52:39.060
Ready?

52:39.062 --> 52:40.932
Here it is.

52:46.136 --> 52:47.638
Here.

52:50.673 --> 52:52.508
Is this from
your other wedding?

52:52.510 --> 52:54.845
Mm-hmm. There's me.

52:55.613 --> 52:57.515
That's the decoration.

52:58.883 --> 53:02.651
- Is that the man who came to the house?
- Mm-hmm.

53:02.653 --> 53:04.122
He was my husband.

53:06.055 --> 53:08.059
I know.

53:10.493 --> 53:13.861
- Is that your son?
- Yeah, that's Jacob.

53:13.863 --> 53:16.633
- He's cute.
- Yeah, he is cute.

53:18.169 --> 53:20.769
- He looks like you.
- He does, doesn't he?

53:20.771 --> 53:22.437
- Yeah.
- Mm.

53:22.439 --> 53:26.677
- I look like my mom, too.
- Yes, you do.

53:31.582 --> 53:32.850
Is that good?

53:47.131 --> 53:49.230
It won't happen again,
cross my heart,

53:49.232 --> 53:51.403
'cause I'm gonna
set two alarms now.

53:51.801 --> 53:54.569
Stop worrying about it, Smith.
It's not a big deal.

53:54.571 --> 53:56.104
OK, I'll talk to you later.

53:56.106 --> 53:57.772
I love you, too. Bye.

53:57.774 --> 54:01.075
Where've you been?

54:01.077 --> 54:02.678
The paint store.

54:02.680 --> 54:04.645
Oh, first, I slept
through the alarm

54:04.647 --> 54:06.747
and then I took the girls to
get doughnuts and then school.

54:06.749 --> 54:09.151
Obviously, they were late,
but, like, by a half an hour,

54:09.153 --> 54:12.022
- so what's the big deal?
- You usually come earlier.

54:13.022 --> 54:14.490
I got stuff, Mark,
responsibilities.

54:14.492 --> 54:16.627
Not everybody's
blissfully unattached.

54:21.231 --> 54:23.232
I'm sorry,
that was unnecessary.

54:23.234 --> 54:26.037
I get it.
You have a life.

54:31.575 --> 54:33.977
Sometimes I think you had
the right idea...

54:35.144 --> 54:37.078
to just forget everything.

54:37.080 --> 54:39.881
Seems like you got everything
you wanted, Elizabeth.

54:39.883 --> 54:45.053
Reliable husband, two cute kids,
house that doesn't need fixing up.

54:45.055 --> 54:47.522
You let all the cold,
hard grief pass through you

54:47.524 --> 54:49.790
and leave space for
the happiness to grow.

54:49.792 --> 54:52.660
So you read my book?

54:52.662 --> 54:55.800
Yeah.
I read it.

54:57.635 --> 54:59.968
I used to read
everything you wrote.

54:59.970 --> 55:02.703
I remember. I just didn't think
you'd wanna read it.

55:02.705 --> 55:04.772
Yeah, I wanted to know.

55:04.774 --> 55:06.677
Know what?

55:08.845 --> 55:10.912
How you got through it.

55:10.914 --> 55:13.080
Well...

55:13.082 --> 55:15.153
Don't believe
everything you read.

55:16.220 --> 55:18.153
Any part in particular?

55:18.155 --> 55:19.990
I don't know.

55:20.990 --> 55:23.227
All of it, maybe.

55:24.961 --> 55:27.531
I thought I had
gotten through it, but...

55:39.176 --> 55:41.142
That book is just a lie
that I told myself,

55:41.144 --> 55:43.847
and I wrote it down,
and I told it to everybody else.

55:45.348 --> 55:47.214
That's disappointing.

55:47.216 --> 55:48.883
Here I thought
you had everything figured out.

55:48.885 --> 55:52.523
Well...

55:53.189 --> 55:55.756
No.

55:55.758 --> 55:57.661
Nope.

56:00.164 --> 56:02.934
You deserve to be happy.

56:06.236 --> 56:08.606
Mom!

56:14.211 --> 56:16.814
He hit his head on the window.

56:18.682 --> 56:20.285
He's broken.

56:24.921 --> 56:26.690
Do you think it hurt?

56:29.627 --> 56:32.230
No. I think it happened
really fast.

56:34.031 --> 56:35.266
What do you think?

56:38.669 --> 56:40.571
It didn't hurt.

56:41.638 --> 56:44.075
We have to have
a funeral.

56:44.975 --> 56:46.174
God bless this bird.

56:46.176 --> 56:50.748
She was so good
at flying...

56:51.649 --> 56:52.980
except for today.

56:52.982 --> 56:55.783
She'll miss migrating south

56:55.785 --> 56:59.087
and laying eggs.
We're really sad to see her go.

56:59.089 --> 57:01.256
Thanks for everything.
Um...

57:01.258 --> 57:02.424
God bless you.
Amen.

57:02.426 --> 57:04.062
Amen.

57:15.673 --> 57:17.372
Mark?

57:17.374 --> 57:18.839
- Hey.
- Hi.

57:18.841 --> 57:20.241
Hi, I'm Amy.
We haven't officially met.

57:20.243 --> 57:23.245
- Hi.
- Um, I know this is a total imposition,

57:23.247 --> 57:25.212
but is there any way
you can watch Dash?

57:25.214 --> 57:28.049
My sitter just called and
she's got food poisoning,

57:28.051 --> 57:30.218
and I tried to find somebody at
the hospital to cover my shift,

57:30.220 --> 57:32.120
but I couldn't.

57:32.122 --> 57:34.955
Um... I promise,
I will make it up to you.

57:34.957 --> 57:37.024
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you!

57:37.026 --> 57:38.426
- I'm coming over.
- Thank you so much.

57:38.428 --> 57:40.696
- What's up, buddy?
- Well, my pole broke

57:40.698 --> 57:42.830
when I was trying to
use it as a catapult.

57:42.832 --> 57:44.832
- Yeah, I see that.
- You got him?

57:44.834 --> 57:47.035
- Come here, chief. Hey.
- Yeah.

57:47.037 --> 57:49.303
Fixed it pretty good with super
glue and duct tape, though.

57:49.305 --> 57:50.675
Yeah, it's all right.

57:53.410 --> 57:55.780
Do you think
he's a crust or a no-crust guy?

57:56.345 --> 57:59.082
- No crust.
- Yeah.

58:00.017 --> 58:02.283
I want-I want to play.

58:02.285 --> 58:03.884
I'll play with you.

58:03.886 --> 58:05.754
Do you wanna go upstairs
and play in your fort?

58:05.756 --> 58:10.261
I wanna play outside
with Daddy... and Dash.

58:12.162 --> 58:13.995
When you're fishing
you just gotta go like this.

58:13.997 --> 58:15.897
Kind of shoot it like that.

58:19.502 --> 58:22.006
Jacob.

58:22.906 --> 58:24.709
Jacob.

58:26.176 --> 58:28.944
- I don't wanna go yet.
- Jacob?

58:28.946 --> 58:30.879
I wanna play with Daddy, too.

58:30.881 --> 58:33.785
Ow.

58:38.321 --> 58:40.090
Jacob.

58:40.923 --> 58:42.359
Jacob, what's happening?

58:43.426 --> 58:45.762
Jacob,
who are you talking to?

58:46.196 --> 58:47.732
Her.

58:51.100 --> 58:53.236
Daddy!

58:57.073 --> 58:58.276
Liz?

58:59.209 --> 59:00.142
Jake, what happened?

59:00.144 --> 59:02.377
- Mommy fell.
- Hey.

59:02.379 --> 59:05.881
Hey, are you OK?
Are you all right?

59:05.883 --> 59:07.182
- Someone was here.
- What?

59:07.184 --> 59:08.886
Someone was here.

59:10.287 --> 59:12.957
- I don't see anything.
- She was right...

59:13.890 --> 59:15.524
It was...

59:15.526 --> 59:17.228
It was right there.

59:18.162 --> 59:19.461
You all right?
Liz, look at me.

59:19.463 --> 59:22.100
- Hmm.
- Are you OK?

59:36.479 --> 59:38.979
Beat it.

59:38.981 --> 59:41.950
- Let me do the rest.
- I can do it.

59:41.952 --> 59:44.553
No. Go sit down.

59:44.555 --> 59:46.257
I'll dry.

- Hi, sorry, I, um...
- Hi.

01:01:34.298 --> 01:01:36.096
I tried the front door,
no one answered, so I just...

01:01:36.098 --> 01:01:38.035
That's OK.
That's good.

01:01:39.202 --> 01:01:41.502
I'm really sorry.

01:01:41.504 --> 01:01:44.439
You know, oh, Dash is, he's
sleeping on the couch in here.

01:01:44.441 --> 01:01:47.944
Oh, OK. Thanks.
Sorry. I owe you one.

01:01:48.211 --> 01:01:49.213
It's fine.

01:01:59.488 --> 01:02:02.357
Whoooo.

01:02:02.359 --> 01:02:04.191
Hey, buddy,
can I ask you something?

01:02:04.193 --> 01:02:06.593
Your mom saw someone
in the house today.

01:02:06.595 --> 01:02:08.899
Did you see it, too?

01:02:09.999 --> 01:02:12.035
Monkey, was someone
in the house today?

01:02:13.035 --> 01:02:15.138
Not just today.

01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:23.310
I don't know what
you want from me.

01:02:23.312 --> 01:02:26.413
I told you
to send him back.

01:02:26.415 --> 01:02:28.649
But did you do that?
No.

01:02:28.651 --> 01:02:31.352
Instead,
you're playing house with him.

01:02:31.354 --> 01:02:32.754
No, I did what
you told me to do.

01:02:32.756 --> 01:02:34.288
I asked him why he was here,

01:02:34.290 --> 01:02:36.156
I asked him what he wanted.

01:02:36.158 --> 01:02:39.526
- He won't answer me.
- I don't wanna hand out parenting tips,

01:02:39.528 --> 01:02:43.330
but even I know you gotta ask
a five-year-old, like, 15 times

01:02:43.332 --> 01:02:46.700
before you get an answer. How hard are you
really trying to send him on his way?

01:02:46.702 --> 01:02:48.669
What if he wants to stay?

01:02:48.671 --> 01:02:50.537
You want him to stay.

01:02:50.539 --> 01:02:53.944
Is it possible to close
whatever door he's opened?

01:02:54.644 --> 01:02:55.709
Yeah.

01:02:55.711 --> 01:02:58.412
Let him go.
Send him back.

01:02:58.414 --> 01:03:00.450
That's how you
close the door.

01:03:00.783 --> 01:03:03.584
Mark, why are there two dogs
tied up on the porch?

01:03:03.586 --> 01:03:07.756
- You must be the ex. I'm Janice.
- Hi.

01:03:07.758 --> 01:03:11.493
She lives in the neighborhood.
She's a dog walker.

01:03:11.495 --> 01:03:15.029
- Oh.
- I'm more of a medium, actually.

01:03:15.031 --> 01:03:18.399
Spiritual advisement and such, the
dog walking thing is on the side.

01:03:18.401 --> 01:03:20.037
Mark told me about your visitor.

01:03:22.539 --> 01:03:25.272
No offense, but that's really
none of your business.

01:03:25.274 --> 01:03:27.441
I'm so sorry about
your little boy.

01:03:27.443 --> 01:03:31.312
And I know it must feel like a miracle
just to lay eyes on him again,

01:03:31.314 --> 01:03:34.381
but just so you know,
you can't keep him here.

01:03:34.383 --> 01:03:37.285
- Please leave.
- This world is for the living...

01:03:37.287 --> 01:03:39.457
Get out of my house now!

01:03:42.091 --> 01:03:44.294
Uh, you know
where to find me.

01:03:46.830 --> 01:03:48.562
- You wanna send him away?
- No, I don't.

01:03:48.564 --> 01:03:50.098
- I'm just...
- Where is he?

01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:52.303
Jacob!

01:03:53.602 --> 01:03:55.669
Jacob.

01:03:55.671 --> 01:03:58.175
Jacob! Answer me!

01:04:04.381 --> 01:04:07.448
Look, Mommy.
I have my sand castle bucket.

01:04:07.450 --> 01:04:08.716
I see that.

01:04:08.718 --> 01:04:11.022
Can we go to the beach?

01:04:11.421 --> 01:04:13.321
I don't know if you can.

01:04:13.323 --> 01:04:16.260
Last one to the car
is a rotten egg!

01:04:18.794 --> 01:04:21.598
What are we waiting for?
Let's go.

01:04:25.801 --> 01:04:28.303
Yay! We're at the beach!

01:04:28.305 --> 01:04:31.105
I wanna build
a giant sand castle,

01:04:31.107 --> 01:04:33.243
as tall as the sky!

01:06:05.301 --> 01:06:07.738
I don't understand
any of this.

01:06:08.805 --> 01:06:11.207
Maybe he'll stay forever.

01:06:12.475 --> 01:06:14.645
Maybe he's an angel.

01:06:28.457 --> 01:06:31.993
- So you're bunking with Dad now?
- Right.

01:06:31.995 --> 01:06:34.928
Where's Mr. Bananas?
Here he is. There you go.

01:06:34.930 --> 01:06:37.834
- Good night.
- You could stay.

01:06:39.568 --> 01:06:42.437
- Please, stay.
- Um...

01:06:42.439 --> 01:06:45.240
Please, please, please,
with extra cheese.

01:06:45.242 --> 01:06:48.178
OK, but just
for a little while.

01:06:49.979 --> 01:06:51.578
Can you read me
a story?

01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:53.348
Well, um,

01:06:53.350 --> 01:06:55.486
I just so happen to have
<i>Pinocchio</i> right here.

01:07:08.932 --> 01:07:10.301
Shit.

01:07:39.361 --> 01:07:40.630
Oh.

01:07:41.631 --> 01:07:43.765
- You OK?
- Oh.

01:07:43.767 --> 01:07:46.370
Just dying of thirst.

01:07:51.941 --> 01:07:53.611
I fell asleep.

01:07:54.611 --> 01:07:55.879
I did, too.

01:08:04.821 --> 01:08:06.656
I should go.

01:08:08.024 --> 01:08:09.893
Don't go.

01:08:39.421 --> 01:08:41.859
Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:08:48.529 --> 01:08:50.434
Are you sorry?

01:09:02.145 --> 01:09:05.783
- See you later.
- Yeah. Be back soon, OK?

01:09:08.118 --> 01:09:09.720
Newspaper.

01:09:11.687 --> 01:09:12.719
How's the book coming?

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:14.490
Smith?

01:09:15.624 --> 01:09:18.559
- What are you doing here?
- Uh...

01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:20.862
You told me he destroyed
your life, so...

01:09:20.863 --> 01:09:24.831
What?
This is what you want now?

01:09:24.832 --> 01:09:25.899
- Someone who...
- No...

01:09:25.901 --> 01:09:30.106
abandons you, who's selfish,
who destroys things?

01:09:30.573 --> 01:09:32.173
- It's more complicated than that.
- Yeah?

01:09:32.175 --> 01:09:34.377
OK.
What's complicated about it?

01:09:35.444 --> 01:09:36.710
Can we talk
about this at home?

01:09:36.712 --> 01:09:38.645
No. Tell me right now.

01:09:38.647 --> 01:09:40.383
Please.

01:09:43.653 --> 01:09:45.856
I... I can't.

01:09:46.622 --> 01:09:49.657
Fine. You know what?
Just stay.

01:09:49.658 --> 01:09:51.559
I'll figure out something
to tell the girls.

01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:52.626
My girls.

01:09:52.627 --> 01:09:55.162
Smith, wait!

01:09:55.164 --> 01:09:56.930
Wait.

01:09:56.932 --> 01:09:58.068
Let me...

01:09:59.535 --> 01:10:01.805
Wait... wait.

01:10:04.039 --> 01:10:07.577
Oh, God.

01:10:09.779 --> 01:10:11.714
Okay.

01:10:35.003 --> 01:10:37.572
When's the real train coming?

01:10:37.574 --> 01:10:39.143
How soon do you need it?

01:10:40.109 --> 01:10:42.242
Soon.

01:10:42.244 --> 01:10:44.414
When's Mommy coming back?

01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:46.617
I don't know.

01:10:50.587 --> 01:10:53.190
- Daddy?
- Yeah.

01:10:54.089 --> 01:10:56.726
I pushed the button.

01:10:58.127 --> 01:10:59.926
What button?

01:10:59.928 --> 01:11:01.798
Don't be mad.

01:11:02.598 --> 01:11:03.867
I'm not mad.

01:11:05.034 --> 01:11:06.036
What button?

01:11:07.537 --> 01:11:10.507
The red button
on the strap.

01:11:12.641 --> 01:11:15.809
I wanted to touch the rain
but I couldn't reach.

01:11:15.811 --> 01:11:18.047
You took off your seatbelt?

01:11:19.047 --> 01:11:20.716
You're not mad?

01:11:22.784 --> 01:11:24.587
Is that why you're here?

01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:27.153
It wasn't her fault.

01:11:27.155 --> 01:11:29.657
I know that.

01:11:29.659 --> 01:11:31.829
But she doesn't know that.

01:11:33.930 --> 01:11:36.165
Mommy!

01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:53.313
I told him that I was
going through some stuff

01:11:53.315 --> 01:11:56.919
and that I needed some time
to sort things out.

01:11:58.186 --> 01:11:59.922
What did he say?

01:12:00.957 --> 01:12:02.223
It doesn't matter.

01:12:02.225 --> 01:12:04.160
I'm here.

01:12:05.061 --> 01:12:06.930
I wanna be here.

01:12:10.132 --> 01:12:11.868
Can I ask you something?

01:12:12.769 --> 01:12:14.003
Maybe.

01:12:15.672 --> 01:12:19.176
Did you come back
for Jacob or for me?

01:12:23.812 --> 01:12:27.281
I just wanna be happy,
Mark, OK?

01:12:27.283 --> 01:12:29.720
Let's try and be happy.

01:12:38.127 --> 01:12:39.193
Happy birthday, Dad.

01:12:41.230 --> 01:12:42.665
Come on, make a wish.

01:12:47.169 --> 01:12:49.236
I know about the surprise.

01:12:49.238 --> 01:12:52.974
- What surprise?
- The party your mother's throwing for me tonight.

01:12:52.976 --> 01:12:55.710
I've told her a thousand times
I hate a fuss,

01:12:55.712 --> 01:12:57.877
- but you know how she is.
- She loves a party.

01:12:57.879 --> 01:12:59.145
- Mm-hmm.
- Huh?

01:12:59.147 --> 01:13:01.048
Oh, you want your present?

01:13:01.050 --> 01:13:05.118
Mm-hmm.

01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:06.653
Yeah.

01:13:06.655 --> 01:13:08.792
Oh.

01:13:09.324 --> 01:13:10.626
Oh.

01:13:12.195 --> 01:13:14.831
It looks like the real thing.

01:13:22.805 --> 01:13:24.772
I know there's no party.

01:13:24.774 --> 01:13:27.041
Your mother's
been gone for years.

01:13:27.043 --> 01:13:29.676
Heart attack.

01:13:29.678 --> 01:13:31.911
That's OK, Pop.

01:13:31.913 --> 01:13:33.916
We're having a party
right now.

01:13:35.685 --> 01:13:38.221
Maybe next week
Jacob will come by.

01:13:42.425 --> 01:13:44.628
Jacob's gone, too.

01:13:51.868 --> 01:13:53.971
You're a good son.

01:14:01.310 --> 01:14:04.245
- We were camping.
- I can't believe you remember that.

01:14:04.247 --> 01:14:06.080
- That's me.
- Right.

01:14:06.082 --> 01:14:09.282
- What's <i>Upwelling?</i>
- What?

01:14:09.284 --> 01:14:12.152
That's your book.
What's it mean?

01:14:12.154 --> 01:14:15.889
Oh. Well,
it's when the current

01:14:15.891 --> 01:14:18.858
pushes the dark, cold water
from the bottom of the ocean

01:14:18.860 --> 01:14:20.428
all the way up
to the surface

01:14:20.430 --> 01:14:22.996
and it wipes out all
the worn-out water

01:14:22.998 --> 01:14:25.366
and it feeds it nutrients
and food.

01:14:25.368 --> 01:14:29.705
- Even though it's cold and dark.
- That's right. Mm-hmm.

01:14:30.038 --> 01:14:31.974
You shouldn't be afraid.

01:14:33.709 --> 01:14:35.242
I'm not.

01:14:43.086 --> 01:14:44.751
OK.

01:14:44.753 --> 01:14:46.055
Jacob?

01:15:10.312 --> 01:15:11.411
Oh, my God.

01:15:13.915 --> 01:15:15.515
What's going on?

01:15:15.517 --> 01:15:17.484
Look, it's my mom.

01:15:17.486 --> 01:15:19.853
It was my mom
in the house all along.

01:15:19.855 --> 01:15:21.388
She's trying to say
something to me.

01:15:21.390 --> 01:15:23.858
Elizabeth, come on.
It's just us.

01:15:23.860 --> 01:15:25.760
No, she's right there.
She's right by the door.

01:15:25.762 --> 01:15:28.429
- She's trying to say...
- Elizabeth!

01:15:28.431 --> 01:15:30.898
- Hey! Elizabeth, what's going on?
- No. I'm OK.

01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:33.067
Oh, no, no.
You're not OK.

01:15:33.069 --> 01:15:35.202
Elizabeth?
Elizabeth, what's wrong?

01:15:35.204 --> 01:15:37.772
Help.

01:15:37.774 --> 01:15:41.008
Help.
OK, Liz, stay with me.

01:15:41.010 --> 01:15:43.844
Help! I need some help.

01:15:58.427 --> 01:15:59.993
Hey.

01:15:59.995 --> 01:16:03.531
- Hi.
- Hi. I heard your wife was brought in.

01:16:03.533 --> 01:16:05.131
Yeah.

01:16:05.133 --> 01:16:07.837
Come on.
I'll take you to see her.

01:16:10.506 --> 01:16:12.876
Here you go.

01:16:14.043 --> 01:16:15.979
- Thank you.
- Sure.

01:16:33.829 --> 01:16:35.895
What's going on?

01:16:35.897 --> 01:16:38.933
I stopped taking my
antidepressants cold turkey.

01:16:38.935 --> 01:16:42.102
Stupid, I know.
Apparently I'm in withdrawal.

01:16:42.104 --> 01:16:44.004
Have you ever heard
of a brain shiver?

01:16:44.006 --> 01:16:46.340
It's like this tiny jolt
of electricity

01:16:46.342 --> 01:16:49.012
zapping through your brain
and then, boom, lights out.

01:16:51.180 --> 01:16:54.281
- And that's it?
- That's it.

01:16:54.283 --> 01:16:57.053
Just need a little R and R
and I'll be good as new.

01:16:58.921 --> 01:17:00.390
Ready to beam me
outta here?

01:17:03.124 --> 01:17:05.261
- Yeah. I'll get the car.
- OK.

01:17:36.191 --> 01:17:39.061
Hey!
My trains came.

01:17:42.498 --> 01:17:44.331
I'm gonna go take a rest,
OK?

01:17:44.333 --> 01:17:45.969
OK.

01:17:56.579 --> 01:17:58.381
Wow. You've been busy.

01:18:00.650 --> 01:18:03.186
I went on a train...

01:18:03.985 --> 01:18:05.551
by myself.

01:18:05.553 --> 01:18:07.955
You did?

01:18:07.957 --> 01:18:10.691
It was a long ride.

01:18:10.693 --> 01:18:12.459
Where was it going?

01:18:12.461 --> 01:18:14.431
Everywhere.

01:18:15.964 --> 01:18:18.601
Mommy's coming with me
next time.

01:18:20.369 --> 01:18:21.504
What do you mean?

01:18:22.538 --> 01:18:25.008
She's coming with me.

01:18:37.453 --> 01:18:39.455
Are you sick?

01:18:42.324 --> 01:18:43.957
Don't bullshit me.

01:18:43.959 --> 01:18:46.229
Tell me what
the doctor said.

01:18:57.339 --> 01:18:59.572
T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia.

01:18:59.574 --> 01:19:02.142
What? What does that...
what does that mean?

01:19:02.144 --> 01:19:05.048
- It doesn't mean anything good.
- Elizabeth!

01:19:06.649 --> 01:19:10.086
Very aggressive
and very advanced.

01:19:14.489 --> 01:19:17.224
- I was sick before.
- What?

01:19:17.226 --> 01:19:20.230
- When?
- Right after Smith and I got married.

01:19:23.531 --> 01:19:25.465
Why didn't you call me?

01:19:25.467 --> 01:19:27.701
What was I supposed to say?

01:19:27.703 --> 01:19:30.339
"Hi, I married someone else,
I might be dying."

01:19:34.709 --> 01:19:36.712
I thought I beat it, so...

01:19:51.226 --> 01:19:54.363
OK. So...

01:19:57.065 --> 01:19:59.568
What happens now?
I mean...

01:20:01.137 --> 01:20:03.239
When do you start treatment?

01:20:04.806 --> 01:20:06.040
I don't.

01:20:06.042 --> 01:20:08.345
What are you talking about?

01:20:09.611 --> 01:20:11.577
I'm not gonna get better
this time.

01:20:11.579 --> 01:20:13.313
You don't know that.

01:20:13.315 --> 01:20:14.447
Yes, I do.

01:20:14.449 --> 01:20:16.383
There has to be something!

01:20:16.385 --> 01:20:19.021
I don't want what
they're offering me.

01:20:19.721 --> 01:20:20.854
It's not gonna save me,

01:20:20.856 --> 01:20:23.689
it's just gonna make the time
I have left a living hell.

01:20:23.691 --> 01:20:26.229
Please understand that.

01:20:31.367 --> 01:20:33.399
No. Oh...

01:20:52.555 --> 01:20:54.457
Jacob told me something.

01:20:57.126 --> 01:20:58.427
He said...

01:21:00.128 --> 01:21:02.399
he took off his seatbelt.

01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:07.733
He took off his seatbelt before the crash.

01:21:10.138 --> 01:21:13.807
It wasn't your fault.

01:21:13.809 --> 01:21:15.509
It was nobody's fault.

01:22:42.698 --> 01:22:44.334
Seed bombs.

01:22:45.266 --> 01:22:46.465
I wanted wildflowers
at the wedding

01:22:46.467 --> 01:22:48.568
so I threw a bunch
of seed bombs,

01:22:48.570 --> 01:22:50.272
because I suck at gardening.

01:22:50.972 --> 01:22:52.809
And they worked.

01:22:53.842 --> 01:22:55.445
They're still working.

01:22:56.244 --> 01:22:58.778
Remember, you had to get
Jacob out of the attic.

01:22:58.780 --> 01:23:01.417
He wouldn't put his tie on.

01:23:03.319 --> 01:23:05.652
And that dog barked
the whole time.

01:23:05.654 --> 01:23:09.956
That dog barks through the whole wedding.

01:23:13.962 --> 01:23:15.931
I was scared
I'd mess it all up.

01:23:16.798 --> 01:23:18.298
Well, we did.

01:23:23.872 --> 01:23:25.675
But we got it back.

01:23:35.417 --> 01:23:37.520
Thank you for picking me.

01:23:39.288 --> 01:23:42.258
I promise to always
tell you the truth.

01:23:43.859 --> 01:23:45.895
I vow to love you.

01:23:46.794 --> 01:23:48.597
And I vow to forgive you.

01:23:50.466 --> 01:23:52.965
I vow to be a good father

01:23:52.967 --> 01:23:54.836
to our boy.

01:23:57.672 --> 01:23:59.372
I vow to make you laugh.

01:24:00.876 --> 01:24:03.542
To tell the bike trail story,

01:24:03.544 --> 01:24:06.548
and don't forget
the Life Savers.

01:24:07.548 --> 01:24:09.718
At least I got that part right.

01:24:16.025 --> 01:24:18.394
We are so lucky.

01:24:20.863 --> 01:24:22.498
Please don't forget that.

01:24:28.470 --> 01:24:30.373
Don't forget.

01:28:12.127 --> 01:28:13.993
Hey.

01:28:13.995 --> 01:28:15.797
Hey.

01:28:19.001 --> 01:28:22.935
- Guess what? I caught two rainbow trout yesterday.
- Oh, yeah?

01:28:22.937 --> 01:28:25.639
Mom took me fishing
for my birthday.

01:28:25.641 --> 01:28:27.807
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

01:28:27.809 --> 01:28:29.843
Having a party on Saturday.

01:28:29.845 --> 01:28:33.179
Cake, clowns, balloons...

01:28:33.181 --> 01:28:35.881
Kinda baby-ish, but...

01:28:35.883 --> 01:28:38.151
makes my mom happy.

01:28:38.153 --> 01:28:39.952
You can come
if you want to.

01:28:39.954 --> 01:28:42.022
OK.

01:28:42.024 --> 01:28:43.258
Really?

01:28:44.325 --> 01:28:46.162
Yeah. I like cake.

01:28:49.163 --> 01:28:50.830
Do you still have
the train?

01:28:50.832 --> 01:28:52.602
Yeah.

01:28:55.337 --> 01:28:56.937
Do you wanna go inside
and look at it?

01:28:56.939 --> 01:28:58.574
Cool!

01:29:35.335 --> 01:29:40.335
