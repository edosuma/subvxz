WEBVTT

00:01.130 --> 00:03.093
Previously on <i>Hell's Kitchen...</i>

00:03.317 --> 00:04.059
Just got dirty.

00:04.259 --> 00:05.459
The blue team was divided

00:05.882 --> 00:07.082
with Russell on one side

00:07.282 --> 00:08.482
the more pissed off he gets,
the more I'm smiling.

00:09.008 --> 00:10.976
And Vinny and Trev
on the other.

00:11.044 --> 00:12.878
In the three entree
relay challenge...

00:12.946 --> 00:15.147
Let's go, Trev!
Come on, Jilli!

00:15.215 --> 00:17.149
The dysfunctional men's team
got a break...

00:17.217 --> 00:18.617
Come on, Vinny!

00:18.685 --> 00:20.118
When Jillian dropped the ball.

00:20.186 --> 00:22.154
Oh, no!

00:22.222 --> 00:23.755
Where's the salmon?

00:23.823 --> 00:25.824
I burned my hand.
That's why I dropped it.

00:25.892 --> 00:27.092
And after three consecutive
losses...

00:27.160 --> 00:29.161
Congratulations to the men.

00:29.229 --> 00:31.029
The blue team finally
won a challenge.

00:31.097 --> 00:33.799
I love buying stuff.
I love buying stuff!

00:33.866 --> 00:35.267
At dinner...

00:35.335 --> 00:36.435
Don't make me look
Stupid.

00:36.502 --> 00:37.669
Yes, Chef!

00:37.737 --> 00:38.971
Nona was consistent...

00:39.038 --> 00:40.806
Nona, very good, that risotto.

00:40.873 --> 00:43.208
And Sabrina continued
to surprise everyone...

00:43.276 --> 00:45.010
<i>That New York strip's</i>
<i>cooked perfectly.</i>

00:45.078 --> 00:46.278
<i>Let's go.</i>
Thank you, Chef.

00:46.346 --> 00:47.446
With another strong service.

00:47.513 --> 00:49.581
Keep it like that now.
Yes, chef!

00:49.649 --> 00:51.283
But Gail was a miserable
mess on fish.

00:51.351 --> 00:53.185
Every table's the same!

00:53.253 --> 00:54.853
That's Raw!
Get out!

00:54.921 --> 00:56.221
Yes, Chef.
Get out!

00:56.289 --> 00:58.690
In the blue kitchen...

00:58.758 --> 00:59.992
Russell was rock solid...

01:00.059 --> 01:01.460
<i>Excellent.</i>

01:01.527 --> 01:02.628
But Vinny was horrific
on meat...

01:02.695 --> 01:04.696
Vinny, it's still
Walking!

01:04.763 --> 01:06.064
<i>Look at it!</i>

01:06.132 --> 01:07.399
And a nightmare on fish.

01:07.467 --> 01:09.735
The batch is raw!

01:09.802 --> 01:11.737
After both teams completed
service...

01:11.804 --> 01:14.039
Let's go.
Well done, well done, well done.

01:14.107 --> 01:15.841
Chef Ramsay gave the Chefs
an assignment...

01:15.908 --> 01:18.243
Think about the one individual
that doesn't belong

01:18.311 --> 01:20.112
in the final six.

01:20.179 --> 01:21.513
And the Chefs were
nearly unanimous.

01:21.581 --> 01:22.848
Trev is the weakest, Chef.

01:22.915 --> 01:23.515
Trevor, Chef.
Trev.

01:23.583 --> 01:25.350
Trev.

01:25.418 --> 01:27.319
And while Trev lost
the popularity contest...

01:27.387 --> 01:29.221
Never been a ladies' man.

01:29.289 --> 01:30.255
Chef Ramsay felt there
were two others

01:30.323 --> 01:31.390
more deserving.

01:31.457 --> 01:33.392
Gail and Vinny, step forward.

01:33.459 --> 01:35.460
Vinny, take off your jacket.

01:35.528 --> 01:37.562
And with Vinny's surprising
departure,

01:37.630 --> 01:40.866
the final six are now set,
ready to do battle.

01:40.933 --> 01:41.933

The final six.
Well done.

02:46.432 --> 02:47.766
Thank you, Chef.

Trev, sweet dreams, huh?

02:54.073 --> 02:56.141
Oh, yeah.
With one eye open.

02:56.209 --> 02:57.576
The girls tried
everything they could

02:57.643 --> 02:58.910
to get rid of me tonight.

02:58.978 --> 03:00.645
Who was the first one
with a black jacket?

03:00.713 --> 03:03.382
This guy and I'm not going
anywhere anytime soon.

03:06.753 --> 03:09.287
Final six, baby!

03:09.355 --> 03:10.856
What's that?
What's that?

03:10.923 --> 03:12.491
Oh, that's black.
That's a black jacket.

03:16.696 --> 03:18.029
So nice!

03:18.097 --> 03:20.465
"Congratulations.

03:20.533 --> 03:21.967
Please enjoy my limited
edition red wine."

03:22.034 --> 03:22.834
Oh, nice!
No way.

03:22.902 --> 03:24.669
Ah!

03:24.737 --> 03:27.205
Yes!
Doesn't it look great on me?

03:27.273 --> 03:29.074
Black is definitely my color.

03:29.142 --> 03:30.542
Black never looked so good.

03:34.981 --> 03:36.381
It is good wine.

03:36.449 --> 03:38.150
The receiving of black jackets

03:38.217 --> 03:40.152
is always a momentous
occasion

03:40.219 --> 03:42.854
and the Chefs go to bed happy
and content except for...

03:42.922 --> 03:45.090
Four chicks in black jackets.

03:45.158 --> 03:47.459
Trev, who has other things
on his mind.

03:47.527 --> 03:49.094
What a pain in the Ass.

03:49.162 --> 03:50.929
It's me versus the chicks.

03:50.997 --> 03:52.864
I got to look out
for number one.

03:52.932 --> 03:56.868
Got to drive a serious stake
into that little harem.

03:56.936 --> 03:59.104
And if you think I'm gonna
Slow down,

03:59.172 --> 04:00.672
you're wrong.

04:00.740 --> 04:03.041
I'm gonna outperform
all their asses.

04:03.109 --> 04:06.044
It's mine to lose.

04:06.112 --> 04:10.982
Mine to win.

04:11.050 --> 04:13.652
It's an early wake-up,
but today is unlike

04:13.719 --> 04:15.654
the other days these Chefs
have faced before.

04:15.721 --> 04:17.589
There are no more teams
and they're

04:17.589 --> 04:20.492
about to be tested in their
first individual challenge

04:20.560 --> 04:22.260
Morning.
Morning, Chef.

04:22.328 --> 04:24.896
In my lifetime,
I've been very fortunate to eat

04:24.964 --> 04:26.998
in some of the finest
restaurants across the world.

04:27.066 --> 04:29.534
The first impression
is critical, right?

04:29.602 --> 04:31.136
Yes, Chef.

04:31.204 --> 04:33.271
There's nothing like
an amazing amuse-bouche

04:33.339 --> 04:34.606
to really kick start off with
that perfect dinner.

04:34.674 --> 04:38.176
It's a one-bite wonder,
which brings me

04:38.244 --> 04:40.212
to this morning's challenge.

04:40.279 --> 04:42.981
Each of you will create
something that will make

04:43.049 --> 04:45.083
a spectacular first impression.

04:45.151 --> 04:47.652
A unique amuse.

04:47.720 --> 04:48.587
<i>Yes?
</i> Yes, Chef.

04:48.654 --> 04:49.788
<i>Right.</i>

04:49.856 --> 04:51.923
I've invited
a few exceptional Chefs

04:51.991 --> 04:54.125
to help me judge
this amazing challenge.

04:54.193 --> 04:56.127
Joining me now,
he's not only a great Chef,

04:56.195 --> 04:57.829
but he's renowned
as a bit of a maverick,

04:57.897 --> 05:00.232
please welcome Ludo Lefebvre,

05:00.299 --> 05:02.267
Chef-owner of Ludobites.

05:02.335 --> 05:05.136
I'm like, "oh, hell no.
That's a Chef?"

05:05.204 --> 05:07.105
Good to see you.
Are you well?
Yes.

05:07.173 --> 05:10.041
He's, like, all tan and he has,
like, beautiful eyes.

05:10.109 --> 05:12.410
I'm like, "that is so cute."

05:12.478 --> 05:14.112
How are you guys?
Morning.

05:14.180 --> 05:18.984
He is, like, a Chef God.

05:19.051 --> 05:20.418
<i>Right.</i>

05:20.486 --> 05:22.187
Now please welcome
Michelin star Chefs,

05:22.255 --> 05:24.289
husband and wife team,
owners of Hatfield's Restaurant,

05:24.357 --> 05:26.658
Quinn and Karen Hatfield.

05:26.726 --> 05:28.360
<i>Good morning.</i>

05:28.427 --> 05:29.561
<i>Excellent.</i>

05:29.629 --> 05:31.162
Please say good morning

05:31.230 --> 05:33.899
to the Chef-owner of Jar,
Suzanne Tracht.

05:33.966 --> 05:35.700
How are you?
I'm good, thank you.

05:35.768 --> 05:38.136
Chef-owner of the
two-Michelin-star-rated

05:38.204 --> 05:40.505
Restaurant Providence,
please say good morning

05:40.573 --> 05:42.207
Cimarusti.

05:42.275 --> 05:44.276
Michael, good morning.

05:44.343 --> 05:45.844
<i>Good morning.</i>

05:45.912 --> 05:46.811
Absolute pleasure.
Thank you so much.

05:46.879 --> 05:48.013
Good to see you.

05:48.080 --> 05:49.381
I've never been
in the presence

05:49.448 --> 05:50.582
of that many Michelin stars.

05:50.650 --> 05:51.683
This was a rare treat for me.

05:51.751 --> 05:53.285
First individual challenge,

05:53.352 --> 05:55.854
I can't think of a better array
of phenomenal judges.

05:55.922 --> 05:57.923
For me to have to cook
for these crazy-ass

05:57.990 --> 06:00.725
three-Michelin-star Chefs,
like--

06:00.793 --> 06:02.561
I thought Michelin was a tire.

06:02.628 --> 06:04.429
It was definitely
nerve-racking.

06:04.497 --> 06:06.998
These five amazing judges will
be judging all of you,

06:07.066 --> 06:08.667
first off, on presentation,

06:08.734 --> 06:10.936
then they'll be judging you
on taste.

06:11.003 --> 06:13.171
So let it go, yes?

06:13.239 --> 06:14.406
Yes, Chef.

06:14.473 --> 06:15.941
1 amuse,

06:16.008 --> 06:17.375
5 portions,

06:17.443 --> 06:19.444
30 minutes to create it.

06:19.512 --> 06:21.046
Excited?
Yes, Chef.

06:21.113 --> 06:22.213
<i>Ready?</i>
Yes, Chef.

06:22.281 --> 06:23.949
30 minutes starting from now.

06:24.016 --> 06:25.383
Off you go.

06:25.451 --> 06:27.152
For the amuse-bouche challenge,

06:27.219 --> 06:28.553
the Chef's creations
will be judged

06:28.621 --> 06:30.689
on not just taste,
but presentation as well.

06:30.756 --> 06:33.291
And let your imagination
go, guys, yes?

06:33.359 --> 06:34.459
Yes, Chef.

06:34.527 --> 06:35.894
All right.

06:35.962 --> 06:37.596
I run back into the kitchen
and I open up

06:37.663 --> 06:39.164
the fridge and I see frog legs
sitting there.

06:39.231 --> 06:41.333
Froggy like daddy.
Daddy like froggy.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.934
Chef Ramsay told me you gotta put

06:43.002 --> 06:44.369
your heart out there and try

06:44.437 --> 06:46.371
and I'm going way outside
the box.

06:46.439 --> 06:47.572
20 minutes to go.

06:47.640 --> 06:49.074
Yes, Chef.

06:49.141 --> 06:50.709
Now that it's individual
challenges,

06:50.776 --> 06:51.543
I think all these people
do have

06:51.611 --> 06:52.844
something to be worried about.

06:52.912 --> 06:53.845
I'm just gonna
let my creativity go

06:53.913 --> 06:55.080
and I'm gonna kill this.

06:55.081 --> 06:56.548
Ten minutes to go.

06:56.616 --> 06:58.283
Yes, Chef.

06:58.351 --> 06:59.784
<i>Think about</i>
<i>the presentation, yeah?</i>

06:59.852 --> 07:01.519
Yes, Chef.
<i>Let it go, yeah?</i>

07:01.587 --> 07:02.420
Shrimp and grits is awesome.

07:02.488 --> 07:03.555
Let's go, guys.

07:03.623 --> 07:05.423
I'm Asian.
I know Asian flavors.

07:05.491 --> 07:07.325
And I'm cooking the mini
spring roll with chicken

07:07.393 --> 07:08.960
and I'm confident
in my cooking.

07:10.429 --> 07:11.596
Okay, guys.
Last minute.

07:11.664 --> 07:13.098
Yes, Chef.

07:13.165 --> 07:14.599
Let's go, Sabrina.

07:14.667 --> 07:15.900
Yes, Chef.

07:15.968 --> 07:18.236
You know, I've never made amuse-bouche,

07:18.304 --> 07:20.071
but I have a lot of heart
and I'm a fighter

07:20.139 --> 07:21.606
and I'm gonna give everything
that I have.

07:21.674 --> 07:24.042
Dude, Me.
Come on.

07:24.110 --> 07:25.644
Okay, last 30 seconds.

07:25.711 --> 07:27.545
Got hot, hot, hot, hot.

07:27.613 --> 07:32.384
Let's go.
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

07:32.451 --> 07:35.920
six, five, four, three,

07:35.988 --> 07:37.489
two, one,

07:37.556 --> 07:42.794
and stop.

07:42.862 --> 07:44.729
Good.
Right.

07:44.797 --> 07:49.167
Each of our judges will score
you from one to ten,

07:49.235 --> 07:52.704
first, on presentation,
and then on taste.

07:52.772 --> 07:55.507
So the maximum is 100.

07:55.574 --> 07:56.341
Clear?
Yes, Chef.

07:56.409 --> 07:57.442
<i>Good.</i>

07:57.510 --> 07:59.778
Gail, please.
Yes, Chef.

07:59.845 --> 08:01.346
Hi.

08:01.414 --> 08:02.914
This is a sesame chicken
spring roll.

08:02.982 --> 08:04.649
The sauce is a peanut sauce made

08:04.717 --> 08:06.751
with honey, lime juice,
soy sauce.

08:06.819 --> 08:08.486
Okay, judges, impressions?

08:08.554 --> 08:09.721
Well done.
It looks great.

08:09.789 --> 08:11.222
It looks crunchy.

08:11.290 --> 08:12.323
<i>Appetizing.</i>

08:12.391 --> 08:13.992
And Ludo?
Look good.

08:14.060 --> 08:16.227
Very nice.
Can't wait to taste.

08:16.295 --> 08:19.831
Okay, and scores for
presentation, first, please.

08:19.899 --> 08:21.666
<i>Wow, wow, wow.</i>
<i>Good.</i>

08:21.734 --> 08:24.502
44 out of 50.

08:24.570 --> 08:26.905
That is a good start.
Great start.

08:26.972 --> 08:28.406
Yay!
It looks good.

08:28.474 --> 08:29.607
Yay.

08:29.675 --> 08:32.342
Judges, taste.
Away you go.

08:32.410 --> 08:33.845
<i>Comments as you're eating?</i>

08:33.913 --> 08:34.779
I really enjoyed it.
Delicious.

08:34.847 --> 08:35.880
Well done.

08:35.948 --> 08:37.682
Scores, please, for taste?

08:37.750 --> 08:39.217
<i>Wow, wow.</i>

08:39.284 --> 08:42.419
43 out of 50 for taste.

08:42.488 --> 08:44.289
<i>87 is the total.</i>

08:44.356 --> 08:46.257
Good start.
That will be the score to beat.

08:46.325 --> 08:48.626
Sabrina, let's go.

08:48.627 --> 08:50.995
All right, Gail's got
a pretty g

08:51.063 --> 08:52.330
that's definitely gonna be,
you know,

08:52.398 --> 08:53.732
a tough one to beat.

08:53.799 --> 08:55.166
It's just a french bread
that I pressed

08:55.234 --> 08:57.268
and smoked salmon,
glazed carrots,

08:57.336 --> 09:04.642
um, a little jalapeno for heat.

09:04.710 --> 09:05.810
Wait, actually,
this one looks better.

09:05.878 --> 09:07.011
Thank you.

09:07.079 --> 09:08.780
Um, he is, like--
I don't know.

09:08.848 --> 09:11.583
He's, like,
a beautiful masterpiece.

09:11.650 --> 09:15.920
Um, um, I hope you that you
enjoy it, so.

09:15.988 --> 09:17.756
<i>Thank U very much.</i>

09:17.823 --> 09:19.023
It looks interesting.

09:19.091 --> 09:20.492
<i>Maybe a little Christmas-y.</i>

09:20.559 --> 09:21.993
We'll give it a try.
Thank you. Ludo?

09:24.396 --> 09:25.764
What?
What did you just say?

09:28.167 --> 09:30.869
"You know, this is amuse-bouche
and I'm french."

09:30.936 --> 09:33.104
It's really the first contact
with the customer.

09:33.172 --> 09:34.906
"And a <i>bonjour</i> this
and a <i>oui, oui,</i> that."

09:34.974 --> 09:36.641
You need to do something
amazing.

09:36.709 --> 09:38.209
You're breaking
my heart, Chef Ludo.

09:38.277 --> 09:39.978
Boring.
I mean, seriously.

09:40.045 --> 09:41.446
I mean, you guys,
put some love in the plate.

09:41.514 --> 09:42.781
You know what, Chef Ludo?
It's over!

09:42.848 --> 09:44.516
It's over!
It's over!

09:44.583 --> 09:45.750
I ain't gonna answer none
of your calls!

09:45.818 --> 09:47.051
Leave me alone.

09:47.119 --> 09:50.622
Judges, please,
scores for presentation.

09:50.689 --> 09:53.358
35 out of 50.

09:53.425 --> 09:56.694
Time for the tasting.

09:56.762 --> 09:57.862
Michael, how did that taste?

09:57.930 --> 09:59.397
Garlic, I don't think,

09:59.465 --> 10:00.799
is not the right way
to start a meal.

10:00.866 --> 10:02.500
<i>Mm-hmm. Thank you.</i>

10:02.568 --> 10:03.802
The garlic's a little
overwhelming for me.

10:03.869 --> 10:05.436
<i>What a shame.</i>

10:05.504 --> 10:06.805
No, I mean, you know,
it was good flavor.

10:06.872 --> 10:07.972
I mean, yes, it tastes
a little garlic,

10:08.040 --> 10:09.374
but I like that.

10:09.441 --> 10:10.909
I think it was great.

10:10.976 --> 10:12.644
Oh, my God.
Like, okay, I'm playing!

10:12.711 --> 10:13.778
I'm playing!
I'm playing! I'll take you back!

10:13.846 --> 10:15.113
Let's work it out.

10:15.181 --> 10:16.581
That was what I was
trying to do.

10:16.649 --> 10:19.117
Chef Ludo, I love you.

10:19.185 --> 10:21.186
Scores for taste,
please, judges.

10:21.253 --> 10:23.922
<i>Ouch.</i>
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

10:23.989 --> 10:25.523
<i>35.</i>

10:25.591 --> 10:28.993
That's a total of 70.

10:29.061 --> 10:31.062
Okay, next, Jillian, please.

10:31.130 --> 10:32.497
Up next is Jillian's grilled
pita bread

10:32.565 --> 10:34.032
with lemon-dill cream sauce

10:34.099 --> 10:35.867
and sauteed vegetables.

10:35.935 --> 10:37.035
First impressions?

10:37.102 --> 10:38.603
I think, for me, it's boring.

10:38.671 --> 10:40.438
<i>Boring?</i>
<i>Boring.</i>

10:40.506 --> 10:42.574
The master Chefs are not
particularly impressed...

10:42.641 --> 10:44.809
My mom can do that.
With Jillian's presentation.

10:44.877 --> 10:47.245
32 out of 50.

10:47.313 --> 10:48.780
And her flavor...

10:48.848 --> 10:50.481
I mean, it tastes
like it looks.

10:50.549 --> 10:52.183
<i>There's not much</i>
<i>going on there.</i>

10:52.251 --> 10:53.017
Leaves something
to be desired as well.

10:53.085 --> 10:54.052
Scores, please.

10:54.119 --> 10:55.920
33 out of 50.

10:55.988 --> 10:57.789
100 is the total.

10:57.857 --> 10:59.424
That's, like, a "d."

10:59.491 --> 11:01.860
I think that's even
an "f" maybe.

11:01.927 --> 11:03.928
And Gail is still
the Chef to beat...

11:03.996 --> 11:05.463
Nona.

11:05.531 --> 11:07.599
As Nona approaches
the judges

11:07.666 --> 11:10.034
with her twist on a Southern
Shrimp and grits.

11:10.102 --> 11:12.303
You could have been a little bit
more inventive.

11:12.371 --> 11:17.242
The judges aren't fans...

11:17.309 --> 11:18.977
Of Nona's presentation.

11:19.044 --> 11:20.645
Enough with the judgment.

11:20.713 --> 11:23.982
Judges.
34 out of 50.

11:24.049 --> 11:25.984
And when it comes to taste...

11:26.051 --> 11:28.920
Sometimes cumin can remind me
of body odor.

11:28.988 --> 11:30.655
<i>Not to be gross or anything.</i>

11:30.723 --> 11:33.491
She doesn't fare much better.

11:33.559 --> 11:35.960
67 is the total.

11:36.028 --> 11:39.063
Gail still in the lead with 87.

11:39.131 --> 11:40.398
<i>You think you've done enough</i>
<i>to stay in the lead?</i>

11:40.466 --> 11:41.499
I hope I have.

11:41.567 --> 11:42.967
<i>Okay, next.</i>

11:43.035 --> 11:44.302
Russell, present your dishes,
please.

11:44.370 --> 11:46.704
Gail, 87.
Still killing it.

11:46.772 --> 11:48.573
You know,
I'm sure she's confident.

11:48.641 --> 11:49.941
I'm not gonna drop my head
like I'm scared.

11:50.009 --> 11:52.210
I'm going up there and I'm gonna
sell my dish.

11:52.278 --> 11:55.747
I did a hamachi crudo with
a little apple celery broth.

11:55.814 --> 11:57.015
First impressions?

11:57.082 --> 11:58.583
I say bravo.
It looks great.

11:58.651 --> 12:00.051
Thank you.

12:00.119 --> 12:02.086
It's very sexy.
I love the little drops of oil

12:02.154 --> 12:03.154
and the little radishes.
All very precise.

12:03.222 --> 12:04.255
It's gorgeous.

12:04.323 --> 12:06.024
Judges, please,
could you score?

12:06.091 --> 12:07.292
<i>Wow.</i>
<i>Boom.</i>

12:07.359 --> 12:07.825
<i>Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.</i>

12:07.893 --> 12:08.793
<i>Wow.</i>

12:09.929 --> 12:11.396
I'm just like, "damn, 50."

12:11.463 --> 12:12.997
I look at Gail and I'm like,
"sorry.

12:13.065 --> 12:14.732
I think you're in trouble."

12:14.800 --> 12:16.501
Russell, well done.
Very impressive.

12:16.568 --> 12:17.936
Judges, would you like
to taste, please?

12:18.003 --> 12:19.203
<i>Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.</i>

12:19.271 --> 12:21.639
The judges give Russell
a score of 50 total.

12:21.707 --> 12:22.640
That's crazy.

12:22.708 --> 12:24.075
It's a beautiful dish.

12:24.143 --> 12:25.209
I hope it tastes terrible.

12:25.277 --> 12:26.210
Impressions?

12:26.278 --> 12:27.578
It's really well done.

12:27.646 --> 12:28.613
<i>Thank you.</i>

12:28.681 --> 12:30.515
The score to beat is 87.

12:30.582 --> 12:33.685
He needs 37 out
of a possible 50 to tie.

12:33.752 --> 12:37.322
Please, may we have your scores?

12:37.389 --> 12:40.558
Wow.

12:43.040 --> 12:44.907
It's the first individual challenge

12:44.965 --> 12:46.399
for the <i>Hell's Kitchen</i>
final six

12:46.467 --> 12:48.401
and Russell has scored a perfect
50 points on presentation.

12:50.275 --> 12:51.209
Russell, well done.

12:51.309 --> 12:51.911
<i>Very impressive.</i>

12:51.940 --> 12:53.507
He needs to score 38 points

12:53.575 --> 12:55.409
on taste to take
the lead from Gail.

12:55.477 --> 12:59.881
Please, may we have your scores
for the taste?

12:59.948 --> 13:03.684
<i>Wow, wow, and wow.</i>

13:03.752 --> 13:05.453
<i>Excellent.</i>

13:05.520 --> 13:06.487
Damn it!

13:06.555 --> 13:08.189
Russell, very, very impressive.

13:08.257 --> 13:10.191
<i>Brilliant work.</i>
<i>Really good.</i>

13:10.259 --> 13:11.792
Russell has scored
a perfect 100...

13:11.860 --> 13:13.794
And, Trevor, let's go.

13:13.862 --> 13:15.096
And now Trev,
the 30-year-old bartender

13:15.163 --> 13:16.898
from Chicago...

13:16.965 --> 13:18.933
Morning, Chefs.

13:19.001 --> 13:20.902
Must completely blow
the judges away just to tie.

13:20.969 --> 13:22.470
There we go.

13:22.537 --> 13:25.006
I have to get
Tens from all of them,

13:25.073 --> 13:27.475
so this thing better
Taste awesome.

13:27.542 --> 13:29.043
I parboiled frog legs.

13:29.111 --> 13:31.312
Finally we have a smile
on Ludo's face.

13:31.380 --> 13:32.647
Chef Ramsay told me,
you know, "go for it.

13:32.714 --> 13:33.981
Out of the box."

13:34.049 --> 13:35.616
That's what I did
and I went for it.

13:35.684 --> 13:37.952
He says, "let it go."
I let it go.

13:38.020 --> 13:40.421
Trevor, you really let it go.

13:40.489 --> 13:43.090
Uh...

13:43.158 --> 13:45.293
I don't know how you make a frog
leg look like that, Trevor.

13:45.360 --> 13:48.229
<i>You know, because--</i>
<i>i don't know.</i>

13:48.297 --> 13:49.664
I just didn't know
what the hell it was

13:49.731 --> 13:50.998
until you told me what it was.

13:51.066 --> 13:52.300
<i>I was a little scared</i>
<i>at first, frankly.</i>

13:52.367 --> 13:53.301
<i>Maybe it tastes better.</i>

13:53.368 --> 13:54.969
Let's hope so.

13:55.037 --> 13:56.404
It looks like maybe you put
the frog in the blender.

13:56.471 --> 13:57.571
No.

13:57.639 --> 13:59.941
You serve me that
at a restaurant,

14:00.008 --> 14:01.075
I don't know if I want to stay.

14:01.143 --> 14:02.543
Wow.

14:02.611 --> 14:04.545
Trev's long shot to impress

14:04.613 --> 14:06.314
the judges has fallen short
on presentation...

14:06.381 --> 14:07.281
<i>31.</i>

14:07.349 --> 14:08.849
Not as bad as I thought.

14:08.917 --> 14:10.952
And the flavor of his dish...

14:11.019 --> 14:12.253
Honestly, the most positive
thing I can say about it...

14:12.321 --> 14:13.321
Just adds insult...

14:13.388 --> 14:14.522
It's very small.

14:14.589 --> 14:15.856
To injury.

14:15.924 --> 14:17.091
<i>31 out of 50.</i>

14:17.159 --> 14:18.960
62 out of 100.

14:19.027 --> 14:20.394
<i>Damn.</i>

14:20.462 --> 14:22.396
Apparently my amuse
was quite amusing.

14:22.464 --> 14:24.598
I go out of the box and all they
can do is pooh-pooh it.

14:24.666 --> 14:25.967
Right there.

14:26.034 --> 14:27.902
All right, Russell,
congratulations.

14:27.970 --> 14:28.903
<i>Really well done.</i>

14:28.971 --> 14:30.838
Judges, you've been amazing.

14:30.906 --> 14:32.039
<i>Thank you so much for giving up</i>
<i>your day to be here.</i>

14:32.107 --> 14:32.907
<i>Really appreciate it.</i>

14:34.242 --> 14:35.209
<i>Thank you once again, judges.</i>

14:35.277 --> 14:36.410
Right.

14:36.478 --> 14:38.479
Russell, this is a great reward.

14:38.547 --> 14:41.415
You're gonna have a tour of the
prize restaurant L.A. Market.

14:41.483 --> 14:43.184
Awesome.

14:43.251 --> 14:47.855
Our guide today will
be the executive Chef

14:47.923 --> 14:49.156
that's unbelievable, Chef.

14:49.224 --> 14:50.291
This is a great reward.

14:50.359 --> 14:51.292
I know Kerry Simon's food,

14:51.360 --> 14:52.960
so I'm super stoked.

14:53.028 --> 14:56.364
After the tour, we're gonna have
a very special lunch.

14:56.431 --> 14:58.466
Kerry has arranged
for a table of four.

14:58.533 --> 15:02.503
That's you, me, Kerry,
and one more.

15:02.571 --> 15:04.805
Pick whoever you want
to join us.

15:12.447 --> 15:13.981
I'll go with Gail,
'cause she finished second.

15:14.049 --> 15:15.249
Gail.
Honorable.

15:15.317 --> 15:16.984
Thank you, Russ.

15:17.052 --> 15:18.719
So, Russell and Gail,
upstairs.

15:18.787 --> 15:20.187
Get changed.
Get ready for the L.A. Market.

15:20.255 --> 15:24.625
Unfortunately, Jillian, Nona,
Trev, Sabrina,

15:24.693 --> 15:25.926
a grueling day ahead of you.

15:25.994 --> 15:28.129
You'll be prepping our kitchen.

15:28.196 --> 15:31.966
However, first, please,
I want you to go upstairs

15:32.034 --> 15:34.769
and give your living quarters
a bloody good clean.

15:34.836 --> 15:38.839
Bedrooms, patio, kitchen, and
of course the bathrooms, yes?

15:38.907 --> 15:40.708
Yes, Chef.
<i>You head upstairs.</i>

15:40.776 --> 15:42.176
The sous Chef will be up with
your cleaning supplies, okay?

15:42.244 --> 15:44.211
Yes, Chef.
I'm pissed.

15:44.279 --> 15:46.947
Cleaning up after all these
jerks up here.

15:47.015 --> 15:49.216
It's gross.
Punishment sucks bad.

15:49.284 --> 15:54.121
All right.

15:54.189 --> 15:55.923
Okay, everybody gather around.

15:55.991 --> 15:57.925
You know it's time
to start cleaning up here.

15:57.993 --> 16:00.127
<i>Everything needs</i>
<i>to be spotless, okay?</i>

16:00.195 --> 16:01.295
Let's get to it.
Everything.

16:03.098 --> 16:05.132
I'll do the kitchen.
It sucks.

16:05.200 --> 16:07.501
It sucks to lose.
It really does.

16:07.569 --> 16:10.171
I'll start the dirty work.

16:10.238 --> 16:12.039
I'll go into the bathroom.

16:12.107 --> 16:14.275
I didn't sign up
for the bathroom duty

16:14.342 --> 16:15.976
when I signed up
for <i>Hell's Kitchen.</i>

16:19.748 --> 16:22.349
Have a good day or try to.

16:22.417 --> 16:24.518
This is definitely
the best reward so far,

16:24.586 --> 16:27.221
hanging out with Chef Ramsay and
Chef Simon at L.A. Market.

16:27.289 --> 16:28.589
So I'm excited.

16:28.657 --> 16:30.758
It could be my home
for a year,

16:30.826 --> 16:33.627
so I want to make sure
that I have a head start.

16:33.695 --> 16:35.729
The L.A. Market
is at the center

16:35.797 --> 16:38.432
of a billion-dollar development
in downtown Los Angeles

16:38.500 --> 16:41.202
and it won't be long before one
of our final six

16:41.269 --> 16:44.872
will become head Chef of this
multimillion-dollar restaurant.

16:44.940 --> 16:47.174
Today, Gail and Russell are
getting a sneak peek

16:47.242 --> 16:49.743
of what life could be like from
executive Chef Kerry Simon.

16:49.811 --> 16:51.078
How's it going, Chef?

16:51.146 --> 16:52.780
Hi.
How you guys doing?

16:52.848 --> 16:53.814
Good. Russell.
Kerry Simon.

16:53.882 --> 16:54.949
Nice to meet you.

16:55.016 --> 16:56.083
I'm Gail.
Nice to meet you.

16:56.151 --> 16:57.485
Welcome to L.A. Market.

16:57.552 --> 16:59.186
Thank you.
It's beautiful.

16:59.254 --> 17:00.387
I'm gonna give you a little
tour of the restaurant.

17:00.455 --> 17:01.755
Yes.
Yes, Chef.

17:01.823 --> 17:03.591
All right, follow me.
Thank you.

17:03.658 --> 17:05.159
Walking into L.A. Market,
it's busy as hell

17:05.227 --> 17:06.292
and it's popping.

17:06.361 --> 17:07.694
It's got 40-foot-high ceilings.

17:07.762 --> 17:09.829
It's got beautiful chandeliers.

17:09.897 --> 17:11.464
It's got all kinds of different
colored tile

17:11.532 --> 17:13.334
around the kitchen highlighted.

17:13.401 --> 17:15.102
It's got, like,
a communal table

17:15.170 --> 17:17.037
that's a beautiful
kind of rustic style.

17:17.105 --> 17:18.606
It's a really amazing spot.

17:18.673 --> 17:20.141
So this is the entrance
to the kitchen.

17:20.208 --> 17:21.976
<i>Now this kitchen</i>
<i>is very complex.</i>

17:22.042 --> 17:23.911
<i>It's a very state-of-the-art</i>
<i>kitchen.</i>

17:23.979 --> 17:27.214
For Chef Simon to personally
escort us through the kitchen

17:27.281 --> 17:29.116
is such an amazing thing.

17:29.184 --> 17:31.318
Like, I might actually
be standing in this one day

17:31.386 --> 17:32.353
wearing Chef whites.

17:32.420 --> 17:36.023
This is just crazy.

17:36.091 --> 17:37.191
<i>Good to see you.</i>

17:37.259 --> 17:38.425
Hey.
How are you?

17:38.493 --> 17:39.627
Good to see you.
Likewise. Good to see you.

17:39.694 --> 17:40.728
Yeah, welcome.
Yeah.

17:40.795 --> 17:41.962
Sit down.
Sit down. Sit down.

17:42.030 --> 17:43.397
Congratulations.
Thanks.

17:43.465 --> 17:44.932
This place has changed since
last we were here.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.734
Amazing, amazing,
amazing, amazing.

17:46.801 --> 17:48.402
While Russell and Gail
are living the high life

17:48.470 --> 17:50.404
at L.A. Market,
back at Hell's Kitchen,

17:50.472 --> 17:54.208
the rest of the Chefs...

17:54.276 --> 17:55.943
Are on cleaning duty.

17:56.011 --> 17:57.178
Damn.

17:57.245 --> 17:59.413
I absolutely hate cleaning.

17:59.481 --> 18:02.850
That's why my husband does all
the cleaning.

18:02.918 --> 18:04.451
Ugh!

18:06.288 --> 18:09.623
What the hell is
in this trash can?

18:09.691 --> 18:12.860
This Smells
like rotten hot dog.

18:12.928 --> 18:14.862
Oh, don't say that!
I'll throw up.

18:16.298 --> 18:17.998
While the rest of the black team

18:18.066 --> 18:19.066
continues to get down
and dirty,

18:19.134 --> 18:20.734
over at L.A. Market,

18:20.802 --> 18:23.137
Gail and Russell continue
to get wined and dined.

18:23.205 --> 18:25.472
First impression of the kitchen,
what was it like?

18:25.540 --> 18:27.808
Being here is like fanning
the flame of fire and desire.

18:27.876 --> 18:29.143
Yeah.
<i>Absolutely.</i>

18:29.211 --> 18:30.344
Absolutely, definitely.
Russell?

18:30.412 --> 18:31.612
You know,
I'm ready to go

18:31.680 --> 18:33.380
and it's gonna be foot
to the gas.

18:33.448 --> 18:35.382
<i>Going into our next service,</i>
<i>you already have</i>

18:35.450 --> 18:37.218
<i>the upper hand,</i>
<i>knowing what's at stake.</i>

18:37.285 --> 18:38.852
So put it to your advantage.

18:38.920 --> 18:40.187
You got to remember that,
you know,

18:40.255 --> 18:42.056
you can't be complacent
at all.

18:42.123 --> 18:44.124
You've got to keep pushing,
come up with new ideas

18:44.192 --> 18:46.527
and search for new ideas, and
you have to inspire yourself.

18:46.595 --> 18:49.663
And everything you do,
think back to here.

18:49.731 --> 18:50.664
Game on.

18:50.732 --> 18:52.166
Definitely, Chef.

18:52.234 --> 18:53.834
It's amazing to peek
at the restaurant.

18:53.902 --> 18:55.402
You know, if that doesn't get
you motivated,

18:55.470 --> 18:57.004
gets you to know that
the stakes are high

18:57.072 --> 18:58.872
and this isn't a game,
I don't know what would.

18:58.940 --> 19:00.140
Thank you.
Cheers.

19:00.208 --> 19:01.141
Thank you, Chef.
Thank you, Chef.

19:01.209 --> 19:02.576
Well done.

19:02.644 --> 19:04.645
While the winners are getting

19:04.713 --> 19:06.347
a taste of the sweet life,
back at Hell's Kitchen...

19:06.414 --> 19:08.115
How much flour and egg
for the pasta?

19:08.183 --> 19:09.250
Trev is still feeling...

19:09.317 --> 19:10.584
Figure it out.

19:10.652 --> 19:12.253
Bitter.
Wow.

19:12.320 --> 19:14.355
These girls totally
Suck.

19:14.422 --> 19:16.657
So, Trev, you guys said you
usually keep your fish where?

19:16.725 --> 19:17.858
Fish station.

19:17.926 --> 19:20.094
I'm sick of it.
I really am.

19:20.161 --> 19:21.795
Are you supposed to put pepper
on this or something?

19:21.863 --> 19:23.264
I don't know.

19:23.331 --> 19:25.332
It's always me covering somebody
else's ass.

19:25.400 --> 19:28.002
Well, nobody's gonna cover me,
so screw everybody else.

19:28.069 --> 19:29.670
Pisses me off to no end.

19:29.738 --> 19:30.904
What's in the ricotta?

19:30.972 --> 19:32.406
Mother, may I.

19:32.474 --> 19:34.341
After an inspiring reward,

19:34.409 --> 19:36.277
Russell and Gail return...

19:36.344 --> 19:38.279
Hey, guys.
Hey, how was it?

19:38.346 --> 19:39.780
It was good.
It was dope.

19:39.848 --> 19:41.048
But there's no time

19:41.116 --> 19:42.549
for these two Chefs
to relax...

19:42.617 --> 19:43.684
All right, guys,
let's go, please.

19:43.752 --> 19:45.586
<i>Quick.</i>

19:45.654 --> 19:48.122
As a challenging dinner service
awaits the final six.

19:48.189 --> 19:49.556
Tonight, for the first time,
one kitchen will be serving

19:49.624 --> 19:51.759
the entire dining room,
so there's double the pressure.

19:51.826 --> 19:55.929
This service has to prove
not just to yourselves,

19:55.997 --> 19:58.732
but to me, that you're worthy
of being in the final six.

19:58.800 --> 20:01.268
Everything you touch, cook,
send, taste tonight,

20:01.336 --> 20:03.137
think L.A. Market.

20:03.204 --> 20:04.238
<i>Great communication.</i>

20:04.306 --> 20:05.572
<i>Great teamwork.</i>

20:05.640 --> 20:06.874
<i>Great style.</i>

20:06.941 --> 20:09.310
And to add a little bit
more excitement

20:09.377 --> 20:11.612
in the dining room,
I'll need one of you

20:11.680 --> 20:16.483
to do a stunning steak Diane,
table size.

20:16.551 --> 20:20.220
<i>That person tonight will be...</i>

20:20.288 --> 20:21.655
Nona.

20:21.723 --> 20:23.457
<i>It's you.</i>
Right on.

20:23.525 --> 20:26.327
I'm going to miss Nona being in
the kitchen with the team.

20:26.394 --> 20:28.762
I really wish Trev would have
got sent out there instead.

20:28.830 --> 20:31.598
Seeing as you're all part
in an amazing way

20:31.666 --> 20:33.834
of the final six, I wanted
to give you something tasty.

20:33.902 --> 20:38.105
<i>Something that would</i>
<i>make your mouth water.</i>

20:38.173 --> 20:41.108
Something that would get
you excited.

20:41.176 --> 20:44.378
Really excited.

20:44.446 --> 20:46.280
<i>That's hot.</i>

20:54.889 --> 20:56.790
Take a look at this.

20:56.858 --> 20:58.258
Whoo!

21:00.362 --> 21:03.230
Who's hungry?

21:09.096 --> 21:11.631
Hell's Kitchen is moments
away from opening,

21:11.699 --> 21:13.133
but before the first ticket
is in...

21:13.200 --> 21:15.068
Take a look at this.

21:15.136 --> 21:18.905
Chef Ramsay has cooked up
a surprise.

21:18.973 --> 21:20.206
Who's hungry?

21:20.274 --> 21:22.042
Whoo!

21:24.312 --> 21:25.712
$1/4 million.

21:25.780 --> 21:26.946
My God.

21:27.014 --> 21:28.948
Holy moley.

21:29.016 --> 21:30.650
Did you see all that money?

21:30.718 --> 21:33.053
Just smell it.

21:33.120 --> 21:35.255
It smells Delicious.

21:35.323 --> 21:37.991
$250,000?

21:38.059 --> 21:42.062
Like, I was not expecting that.

21:42.129 --> 21:45.832
The winner will become
the new head Chef

21:45.900 --> 21:49.469
at the L.A. Market restaurant
with a stunning salary.

21:49.537 --> 21:51.938
<i>$1/4 million.</i>

21:52.006 --> 21:54.374
<i>And if that doesn't</i>
<i>whet your appetite,</i>

21:54.442 --> 21:56.276
<i>you shouldn't be in here.</i>

21:56.344 --> 21:57.877
I want that money, man.

21:57.945 --> 21:59.479
I want to put that
in my bank account.

21:59.547 --> 22:01.781
250 grand would change
my life so much.

22:01.849 --> 22:04.351
For one of you six,
it's yours.

22:04.418 --> 22:07.487
<i>Show me your hunger big-time.</i>

22:07.555 --> 22:08.822
<i>What are we gonna be tonight?</i>

22:08.889 --> 22:10.023
Hungry.

22:10.091 --> 22:11.958
Right.
Get on your sections.

22:12.026 --> 22:15.195
We're opened up in minutes, yes?
Yes, Chef.

22:15.262 --> 22:16.463
Right.
James?

22:16.530 --> 22:17.997
Yes, Chef?
Let's go.

22:18.065 --> 22:19.799
Open Hell's Kitchen, please.
Let's go.

22:21.000 --> 22:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

22:38.185 --> 22:40.720
In addition to the regular
fine-dining menu,

22:40.788 --> 22:42.188
tonight, Chef Ramsay
is featuring

22:42.256 --> 22:44.591
a table-side steak Diane.

22:44.658 --> 22:46.426
Don't set them on fire, okay?
Okay.

22:46.494 --> 22:48.328
Time to kick this bitch
in the ass and roll.

22:48.396 --> 22:49.863
<i>Come on, guys.</i>

22:49.930 --> 22:51.531
I'm gonna push myself to
the absolute limit.

22:51.599 --> 22:52.999
We're not playing
small ball anymore

22:53.067 --> 22:54.367
and you got to be going
for a home run every time.

22:54.435 --> 22:55.869
Here we go.

22:55.936 --> 22:57.270
One dynamic team.
Good luck, everybody, yes?

22:57.338 --> 22:58.905
Yes, Chef.

22:58.973 --> 23:00.006
On order, table 30,
three scallops, one risotto,

23:00.074 --> 23:00.874
three spaghetti.

23:00.941 --> 23:02.375
Yes, Chef.

23:02.443 --> 23:03.576
Tonight, the entire dining room

23:03.644 --> 23:04.644
will be fed by one kitchen.

23:04.712 --> 23:06.045
Let's go.

23:06.113 --> 23:08.081
And it's up to Trev and Sabrina

23:08.149 --> 23:10.083
on appetizers and Gail on fish
to get the dinner service

23:10.151 --> 23:11.584
off to a good start.

23:11.652 --> 23:13.119
Sabrina, let's go.

23:13.187 --> 23:15.622
I can walk this risotto
in 30 seconds.

23:15.689 --> 23:18.358
I might seem like
a little dummy on the outside,

23:18.426 --> 23:21.361
but on the inside,
I'm one cooking machine.

23:21.429 --> 23:22.562
Walking the risotto.

23:22.630 --> 23:24.197
Oh, no.
What is that?

23:24.265 --> 23:25.298
<i>Sabrina!</i>

23:25.366 --> 23:27.200
That is cooked .

23:27.268 --> 23:29.169
And that is fried risotto.

23:29.236 --> 23:30.703
Burnt!

23:30.771 --> 23:31.905
Come on, Sabrina.

23:31.972 --> 23:33.473
Don't start us off like this.

23:33.541 --> 23:36.109
I want risotto,
not fried risotto!

23:36.177 --> 23:37.710
Yes, Chef.
Right now!

23:37.778 --> 23:38.812
Sabrina's first offering

23:38.879 --> 23:40.847
was disappointing,
but Gail...

23:40.915 --> 23:43.383
Scallops, please.
Walking up three scallops.

23:43.451 --> 23:45.218
Is hoping that her scallops
are worthy of praise.

23:45.219 --> 23:46.686
There's

23:46.754 --> 23:48.855
Gail, two seconds.
Come down here.

23:48.923 --> 23:50.557
There's no color!

23:50.624 --> 23:52.959
They need to be colored once and
then turned over, no?

23:53.027 --> 23:54.627
Yes, Chef.

23:54.695 --> 23:57.030
So now when you recook them,
they're gonna be overcooked.

23:57.097 --> 23:58.064
Start again, Gail.

23:58.132 --> 23:59.265
Yes, Chef.

23:59.333 --> 24:00.733
Guys, it's the first table!

24:00.801 --> 24:02.402
Come on!

24:02.470 --> 24:05.004
Sabrina and Gail can't
get it together on apps.

24:05.072 --> 24:06.573
<i>Oh, no.</i>

24:06.640 --> 24:08.274
I need some action, Trevor.

24:08.342 --> 24:10.109
Yes, Chef!
<i>Send spaghetti.</i>

24:10.177 --> 24:11.978
Luckily, I rock on appetizers.

24:12.046 --> 24:13.213
Spaghetti.

24:13.280 --> 24:14.514
I'm the king of lobster
spaghetti.

24:14.582 --> 24:15.949
Oh, dear.
Trev?

24:16.016 --> 24:17.750
See?
Pasta's overcooked

24:17.818 --> 24:18.852
and it's stewed!

24:18.919 --> 24:21.454
Disgusting.

24:21.522 --> 24:22.522
Let's go!

24:22.590 --> 24:24.891
Man, it's so hard to recover

24:24.959 --> 24:26.793
once you get off to such
a horrible start.

24:26.861 --> 24:28.394
We should be better
than that by now.

24:28.462 --> 24:29.963
Do you want me to cook?
No, I don't want you to cook.

24:30.030 --> 24:31.364
I know what the
I'm doing.

24:31.432 --> 24:33.032
It's the first table, guys.

24:33.100 --> 24:34.701
Start the spaghetti!
Start the spaghetti!

24:34.768 --> 24:36.202
I got it!
I got it! I got it!

24:36.270 --> 24:38.071
No, start--
you got--
it's in!

24:38.138 --> 24:40.073
Run your mouth a little more,
Russell.

24:40.140 --> 24:41.441
Why don't you tell me how bad
I'm Doing

24:41.509 --> 24:43.409
on appetizers,
'cause I can't see it?

24:43.477 --> 24:44.744
How long, Trev,
for two spaghetti?

24:44.812 --> 24:45.912
Four!
Four?

24:45.980 --> 24:47.280
Four minutes!
That pasta's gonna cook

24:47.348 --> 24:48.381
in four minutes, Trev.

24:48.449 --> 24:50.517
There's pasta in the bag!

24:50.584 --> 24:51.918
Stop yelling!

24:51.986 --> 24:53.753
Hey, you watch your mouth
right now.

24:53.821 --> 24:55.922
You don't stand over
here and scream.

24:55.990 --> 24:57.857
<i>I'm the one that's waiting</i>
<i>for food from you.</i>

24:57.925 --> 25:00.560
Get your Together
and cook the pasta!

25:01.729 --> 25:03.062
I'm trying.

25:03.130 --> 25:04.664
And all you want
to do is berate me,

25:04.732 --> 25:06.566
belittle me,
get on my ass?

25:06.634 --> 25:09.035
Piss off.

25:09.103 --> 25:11.204
Talk about out
of Control.

25:11.272 --> 25:12.805
<i>Come on, guys.</i>
<i>Focus.</i>

25:12.873 --> 25:14.040
Okay, get the first table out.
Let's go.

25:14.108 --> 25:15.108
<i>Risotto!</i>

25:15.175 --> 25:15.942
Walking, Chef!
There you go.

25:16.010 --> 25:17.310
Move your ass.

25:17.378 --> 25:18.778
Three scallops.
Let's go.

25:18.846 --> 25:19.946
Right here, Chef.
Spaghetti.

25:20.014 --> 25:22.315
Service please.
Let's go.

25:22.383 --> 25:24.450
Now that the first appetizers
have finally left the kitchen...

25:24.518 --> 25:25.852
It is pretty good.

25:25.920 --> 25:27.053
The Chefs are hoping

25:27.121 --> 25:28.521
the momentum continues.

25:28.589 --> 25:30.089
Two truffle salad,
two spaghetti.

25:30.157 --> 25:31.357
<i>How long?</i>
4 1/2.

25:31.425 --> 25:33.026
4 1/2, Chef.

25:33.093 --> 25:34.260
And that can only
be accomplished

25:34.328 --> 25:35.161
if Trev and Sabrina...

25:35.229 --> 25:36.529
How long on apps, Trev?

25:36.597 --> 25:37.931
Work as a team.

25:37.998 --> 25:40.500
I just gave you
4 1/2 15 seconds ago.

25:40.568 --> 25:42.936
So keep talking!
Come on.

25:43.003 --> 25:44.971
She's making salads
and she's calling me

25:45.039 --> 25:46.406
every 15 seconds,
"how long on that spaghetti?"

25:46.473 --> 25:48.041
Just make the Salads.

25:48.108 --> 25:49.776
Talk, Trev.
Talk!

25:49.843 --> 25:51.678
I am not counting down
every 15 seconds.

25:51.745 --> 25:52.745
How long?

25:52.813 --> 25:54.614
Oh, four minutes now!

25:54.682 --> 25:56.249
Four minutes.
Awesome.

25:56.317 --> 25:57.450
How do you get a little whiny
bitch like that

25:57.518 --> 25:58.585
to just shut up and cook?

25:58.652 --> 26:00.286
Take her off my hands.

26:00.354 --> 26:01.955
Take her out back
and put a bullet

26:02.022 --> 26:03.990
right between her beady
little eyes.

26:04.058 --> 26:05.325
<i>That's the point.</i>

26:05.392 --> 26:05.959
<i>We're counting down, okay?</i>

26:06.026 --> 26:07.527
Trev, let's go!

26:07.595 --> 26:09.162
<i>Just quit bitching.</i>
<i>Let's put it out.</i>

26:09.229 --> 26:09.963
I'm not bitching, man.
It's salads.

26:10.030 --> 26:12.498
How long does that take?

26:12.566 --> 26:14.033
Quit it.
Drop it right now.

26:14.101 --> 26:15.702
You two--
you two, come here.

26:15.769 --> 26:16.769
<i>Look at me.</i>
<i>Come here, you.</i>

26:16.837 --> 26:17.804
I need a team.

26:17.871 --> 26:19.305
Less shouting and about

26:19.373 --> 26:20.640
a little bit more cooking?

26:20.708 --> 26:22.208
I'm getting dragged down,

26:22.276 --> 26:23.710
yet no one's commanding
their section!

26:23.777 --> 26:25.144
Yes, Chef.
Wake up!

26:25.212 --> 26:27.313
It's like me and Trevor,

26:27.381 --> 26:29.115
we need a relationship
counselor.

26:29.183 --> 26:31.384
I feel like I'm in, like,
this bad relationship

26:31.452 --> 26:34.554
that I'm, like, desperately
trying to get out of.

26:34.622 --> 26:35.722
I need the apps out.
I need to go.

26:35.789 --> 26:37.190
I need to move!

26:37.257 --> 26:38.958
Sabrina and Trev continue

26:39.026 --> 26:40.226
to prove that they can't work
together again...

26:40.294 --> 26:41.628
The rice is too white.

26:41.695 --> 26:42.729
And again...

26:42.796 --> 26:44.030
Watery again.

26:44.098 --> 26:50.103
And again.

26:50.170 --> 26:52.972
We've still got three tables
of appetizers.

26:53.040 --> 26:55.108
Chef Ramsay adjusts
his game plan...

26:55.175 --> 26:57.043
Entree, two halibut,
two wellingtons, one rib eye.

26:57.111 --> 26:58.778
Yes, Chef.

26:58.846 --> 27:00.413
As he gets the kitchen
moving on entrees.

27:00.481 --> 27:01.781
I can't get the appetizers out.

27:01.849 --> 27:03.116
Yes, Chef!

27:03.183 --> 27:05.084
Now it's up to Russell on meat,

27:05.152 --> 27:08.187
garnish,
and Gail on the fish station

27:08.255 --> 27:09.522
to deliver on the main courses.

27:09.590 --> 27:11.124
I'm ready.

27:11.191 --> 27:13.026
Where's the halibut?
Halibut's ready.

27:13.093 --> 27:13.793
<i>Where's the halibut garnish?</i>

27:13.861 --> 27:15.061
Right here, Chef.

27:15.129 --> 27:16.162
Oh, no.
Gail?

27:18.399 --> 27:19.465
<i>It's not possible!</i>

27:19.533 --> 27:21.100
That's what I got in the pass.

27:21.168 --> 27:22.602
When it's brown, it's cooked.

27:22.670 --> 27:25.371
When it's black, it's .

27:25.439 --> 27:27.874
Stuck to the pan.
Yeah.

27:27.941 --> 27:32.378
That's what I got given
at the Pass!

27:33.814 --> 27:35.515
This is like a sabotage.

27:35.582 --> 27:39.285
Nothing coming out.

27:39.353 --> 27:40.820
There's no teamwork!

27:40.888 --> 27:42.622
There's no care!
There's no passion!

27:42.690 --> 27:43.723
Off!

27:43.791 --> 27:45.825
I've never seen such chaos.

27:45.893 --> 27:48.227
I'm dying! I'm dying!
I'm Dying!

27:48.295 --> 27:49.595
He's gonna kick us all out
of the kitchen.

27:49.663 --> 27:50.663
All of you, just stop!

27:50.731 --> 27:52.298
We're done. This is over.

27:52.366 --> 27:57.336
Come here!

28:02.242 --> 28:05.010
It's the first dinner service
in which the final six

28:05.078 --> 28:06.712
cook in the same kitchen...

28:06.780 --> 28:08.781
I'm dying! I'm dying!
I'm Dying!

28:08.848 --> 28:11.483
But so far, it's been anything
but smooth...

28:11.551 --> 28:12.885
Nothing coming out.

28:12.952 --> 28:14.019
And Chef Ramsay...

28:14.087 --> 28:16.155
All of you, just stop!

28:16.222 --> 28:18.524
Is angrier and more disappointed
than he's ever been.

28:18.591 --> 28:19.925
What's wrong with you?
Nothing, Chef.

28:19.993 --> 28:20.993
<i>Look at me!</i>

28:21.061 --> 28:22.728
Look, you ignorant bitch!

28:22.796 --> 28:24.196
Look at my Eyes
when I'm talking to you.

28:24.264 --> 28:25.664
Yes, Chef.
What's wrong with you?

28:25.732 --> 28:27.266
I'm trying to work, Chef.
I'm trying to communicate.

28:27.333 --> 28:28.667
Wake up!
Yes, Chef.

28:28.735 --> 28:30.436
You, what's wrong with you?
Nothing.

28:30.503 --> 28:32.204
Get a grip!
You got it.

28:32.272 --> 28:33.639
You, you may bark, but it's
All coming out.

28:33.706 --> 28:34.973
And, you, look.

28:35.041 --> 28:38.444
T stuck to the pan!

28:38.511 --> 28:40.412
We don't deserve to wear
the black jackets

28:40.480 --> 28:42.214
and, you know,
this far into the game,

28:42.282 --> 28:43.215
we should be able
to run a kitchen.

28:43.283 --> 28:45.451
For God's sake!

28:45.518 --> 28:46.785
Here, you're gonna have
start a new one.

28:46.853 --> 28:48.754
Guys, we need to move.

28:48.822 --> 28:50.722
It's an hour and 15 minutes
into dinner service

28:50.790 --> 28:53.125
and despite very little leaving
the kitchen...

28:53.193 --> 28:54.927
It's been over an hour.

28:54.994 --> 28:57.429
<i>I see them plating pasta.</i>
<i>Maybe it's ours.</i>

28:57.497 --> 28:59.798
<i>Okay, that'd be good.</i>

28:59.866 --> 29:02.101
Chef Ramsay pushes on.

29:02.168 --> 29:04.269
Nona, start the steak Diane.
Let's go.

29:04.337 --> 29:05.170
Yes, Chef!
Quickly.

29:05.238 --> 29:06.338
Quick.

29:06.406 --> 29:08.307
Everything has
to get timed perfectly

29:08.374 --> 29:10.309
so that when Nona's serving her
steak Diane table-side,

29:10.376 --> 29:12.611
make sure
that my salmon's ready,

29:12.679 --> 29:15.147
so all of our food
will be served together.

29:15.215 --> 29:16.949
Whoo!
Stand back.

29:17.016 --> 29:21.553
The Steak Diane's
about to be served!

29:21.621 --> 29:24.323
Whenever your salmon's ready,
the garnish is now ready.

29:24.390 --> 29:26.258
Lisa, here you are.
One salmon, one halibut.

29:26.326 --> 29:30.028
E, please.
Go.

29:30.096 --> 29:32.764
Oh, wow.
That is killer.

29:32.832 --> 29:34.500
And the Chefs are finally up
to speed...

29:34.567 --> 29:36.502
Hot, hot.

29:36.569 --> 29:37.536
And successfully delivering
food.

29:37.604 --> 29:38.704
Go, please.

29:38.771 --> 29:40.472
Thank you a lot.
Enjoy.

29:40.540 --> 29:42.307
Now the pressure
is on Sabrina and her...

29:42.375 --> 29:43.308
Truffle salads!

29:43.376 --> 29:44.776
It's right here, Chef!

29:44.844 --> 29:46.411
You hurry up!
It's not possible!

29:46.479 --> 29:48.080
The entrees are about
to catch up

29:48.148 --> 29:49.214
with appetizers!

29:49.282 --> 29:50.782
It's not normal!

29:50.850 --> 29:52.351
I mean, the whole thing
is upside down.

29:52.418 --> 29:53.785
Walking it right now.

29:53.853 --> 29:55.320
Come on,
let's get rid of these apps,

29:55.388 --> 29:56.555
jump on entrees
and help out.

29:56.623 --> 29:57.723
Where's the other one?

29:57.790 --> 29:58.991
<i>She's given up.</i>

29:59.058 --> 30:00.292
Her face tells a story.

30:00.360 --> 30:02.561
No, I haven't, Chef.

30:02.629 --> 30:04.897
Well, then fight back,
you little bitch!

30:04.964 --> 30:06.431
Walking, Chef.

30:06.499 --> 30:07.933
No dressing.

30:08.001 --> 30:09.701
Man, you got
to be kidding me.

30:09.769 --> 30:11.403
Sabrina, come here,
you.

30:11.471 --> 30:13.605
Look.
Look.

30:13.673 --> 30:15.974
Hey, come here.
<i>I can see it's not dressed.</i>

30:16.042 --> 30:18.544
There you go.
Ah, Off.

30:18.611 --> 30:21.480
Now it's even a salad.

30:21.548 --> 30:23.815
How in the hell does
a salad come back?

30:23.883 --> 30:25.484
That's the lowest
of the lowest.

30:25.552 --> 30:26.818
More dressing.
No.

30:26.886 --> 30:27.853
Yes.

30:27.921 --> 30:29.288
You take the lettuce,

30:29.355 --> 30:31.056
you squirt the
Dressing on it,

30:31.124 --> 30:32.524
you toss it around a little bit
with the grapes

30:32.592 --> 30:34.092
and the walnuts,
and you set it on the plate.

30:34.160 --> 30:35.227
That's it.

30:35.295 --> 30:36.862
Where is the truffle salad?

30:36.930 --> 30:37.863
Right here, Chef.

30:37.931 --> 30:39.164
Let's go.

30:39.232 --> 30:40.632
Trev has successfully

30:40.700 --> 30:42.334
tossed Sabrina's salads
and the diners

30:42.402 --> 30:44.870
are once again enjoying
their appetizers.

30:44.938 --> 30:46.405
That was very good.

30:46.472 --> 30:48.373
In the kitchen, Chef Ramsay...

30:48.441 --> 30:50.108
Away now, three salmon,
one steak Diane, one Wellington.

30:50.176 --> 30:51.476
Yes, Chef.

30:51.544 --> 30:53.478
Continues to push entrees out.

30:53.546 --> 30:56.515
Mash?
Got it right here, Chef.

30:56.583 --> 30:59.985
Oh, come on.
Come on.

31:00.053 --> 31:02.120
Oh, Jillian.

31:02.188 --> 31:04.556
That is salty as .

31:04.624 --> 31:06.358
You're seasoning like this.

31:06.426 --> 31:08.460
I thought it was a better idea
to sprinkle the salt

31:08.528 --> 31:11.363
than to dip my nasty-ass
hand in it and put it in.

31:11.431 --> 31:13.165
Season with your fingers.
Yes, Chef.

31:13.233 --> 31:14.800
Taste your food.
I know you're mad.

31:14.867 --> 31:16.535
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Chef.

31:16.603 --> 31:18.003
I know it was a bad idea.
I know. I'm sorry.

31:18.071 --> 31:19.538
I'm sorry.
What do I got to do?

31:19.606 --> 31:20.572
<i>Come on, Jillian!</i>

31:20.640 --> 31:21.673
I'm working it, Chef.

31:21.741 --> 31:23.408
Yeah, well, work a bit harder.

31:23.476 --> 31:24.910
Jillian totally screwed up.

31:24.978 --> 31:25.978
Salmon?
Yes, Chef.

31:26.045 --> 31:27.112
Coming right now.

31:27.180 --> 31:28.847
But we're still a team.

31:28.915 --> 31:30.749
We still have to work together
to get this food out

31:30.817 --> 31:31.917
and that's the most important
thing to me right now.

31:31.985 --> 31:34.553
Three salmon.
What is all that water?

31:34.621 --> 31:38.790
Gail's version
of grilled salmon.

31:38.858 --> 31:40.359
Can you not grill salmon?

31:40.426 --> 31:41.960
Yes, Chef, I can.
I can cook fish.

31:42.028 --> 31:43.328
I can do this. I can do this.
I can do this.

31:43.396 --> 31:44.496
I can cook fish.

31:44.564 --> 31:46.398
Did I ask for poached salmon?

31:46.466 --> 31:48.233
No, Chef.
Why have you done this?

31:48.301 --> 31:49.901
<i>You've given up.</i>

31:49.969 --> 31:51.770
I'm gonna keep fighting, Chef.
I'm gonna keep fighting.

31:51.838 --> 31:52.704
<i>Come on, Russell.</i>

31:52.772 --> 31:53.672
Serve the Wellington.

31:53.740 --> 31:54.740
Yes, Wellington's coming.

31:54.807 --> 31:56.008
You've got to push it out.

31:56.075 --> 31:57.976
Wellington.
Oh, dear.

31:58.044 --> 31:59.044
<i>It's raw!</i>

31:59.112 --> 32:00.712
Russell, come here.

32:00.780 --> 32:02.614
<i>They're undercooked.</i>

32:02.682 --> 32:03.849
Get your eyes tested.

32:03.916 --> 32:05.350
We can't get all the food out

32:05.418 --> 32:06.818
and we're supposed
to be the best Chefs.

32:06.886 --> 32:07.986
It's embarrassing.

32:08.054 --> 32:09.021
Don't try to send me !

32:09.088 --> 32:10.222
Yes, Chef.

32:10.290 --> 32:11.657
End of story!
<i>Yes, Chef.</i>

32:11.724 --> 32:13.225
That's all I ask for.
Yes, Chef.

32:13.293 --> 32:14.660
Pay a bit of respect!
Yes, Chef.

32:14.727 --> 32:16.228
The whole service
is blowing up

32:16.296 --> 32:18.430
in front of our faces
right now.

32:18.498 --> 32:20.198
Russell, come here.

32:20.266 --> 32:22.367
And you, come here, you.
And you as well.

32:22.435 --> 32:25.404
Let me just tell all of you
for two Minutes.

32:25.471 --> 32:27.439
Who gives a ?
You've sunk.

32:27.507 --> 32:30.042
You've got your hands full out
there and you're screwing me.

32:30.109 --> 32:31.543
Work as a Team!

32:31.611 --> 32:33.478
If we don't get this together,

32:33.546 --> 32:35.714
the hope of any of us trying
to get L.A. Market

32:35.715 --> 32:37.249
is just going out the window

32:37.317 --> 32:39.651
let's all just shut it down

32:39.719 --> 32:41.286
and Off home,
all of you.

32:41.354 --> 32:42.821
No!
We're not giving up, Chef.

32:42.889 --> 32:45.290
Our kitchen is in trouble.

32:45.358 --> 32:49.594
Piece of .
I can't do this.

32:54.903 --> 32:56.371
It's two hours into
dinner service...

32:56.438 --> 32:58.339
Unbelievable.

32:58.407 --> 32:59.807
And with the final six unable
to pull together

32:59.875 --> 33:01.008
and work as a team...

33:01.076 --> 33:02.877
Let's all just shut it down.

33:02.945 --> 33:04.879
No!
We're not giving up, Chef.

33:04.947 --> 33:05.847
Chef Ramsay delivers
an ultimatum

33:05.914 --> 33:07.682
to all the Chefs.

33:07.750 --> 33:09.617
The next person that makes
the next mistake

33:09.685 --> 33:11.319
get A lot of you.

33:11.387 --> 33:13.121
Get a grip!
Yes, Chef.

33:13.188 --> 33:14.989
I'm not going down.

33:15.057 --> 33:16.791
Two halibut, two wellings,
and one rib eye.

33:16.859 --> 33:18.426
Come on, let's go.
Push this out.

33:18.494 --> 33:19.927
Let's kick this service
in the ass.

33:19.995 --> 33:21.396
Let's go!
Come on, push it out!

33:21.463 --> 33:22.797
Come on, don't deflate!
Let's go!

33:22.865 --> 33:24.232
I'm walking on two halibut.

33:24.299 --> 33:25.967
Let's go.
Garnish, please.

33:26.034 --> 33:29.003
Chef Ramsay's threat motivates
us to work harder

33:29.071 --> 33:30.071
and stay focused.

33:30.139 --> 33:31.139
Coming up on all three.

33:31.206 --> 33:32.173
Service, please.

33:32.241 --> 33:33.341
We started flowing.

33:33.409 --> 33:34.642
Ready.
Coming down.

33:34.710 --> 33:36.110
Go.

33:36.178 --> 33:38.079
And we started to get
into the groove of things.

33:38.147 --> 33:39.414
<i>Garnish!</i>

33:39.481 --> 33:40.815
Here you go, Chef.
Service, please.

33:40.883 --> 33:43.518
Thank you.
Wonderful.

33:43.585 --> 33:44.852
Rib eye coming.

33:44.920 --> 33:46.053
We really need to fight back

33:46.121 --> 33:47.555
and push, push, push.

33:47.623 --> 33:48.890
Rib eye.

33:48.957 --> 33:50.057
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

33:50.125 --> 33:50.825
<i>It's raw in the center.</i>

33:50.893 --> 33:51.793
<i>Russell, stop.</i>

33:51.860 --> 33:53.861
I can't take any more.

33:53.929 --> 33:55.530
<i>I can't do this.</i>

33:55.597 --> 34:00.134
I cannot do this
any More!

34:00.202 --> 34:02.503
I can't do it anymore!

34:02.571 --> 34:06.040
It's not fair on Me
and it's not fair on them!

34:06.108 --> 34:08.376
Get out!

34:08.444 --> 34:09.543
Off!

34:09.610 --> 34:11.746
<i>Get out!</i>

34:11.813 --> 34:16.250
Yeah, that's right!
Get out!

34:16.318 --> 34:18.252
Get out!

34:18.320 --> 34:21.121
Hey, catch your blue steak.

34:21.190 --> 34:24.324
Blue.

34:24.393 --> 34:26.027
This sucks.

34:26.094 --> 34:27.628
It's a horrible feeling.

34:27.696 --> 34:29.130
Feels like you're
letting down the world.

34:35.204 --> 34:39.206
Let me tell you something very,
very quickly.

34:39.274 --> 34:43.911
What I want to ask you all
is to take off your jackets...

34:43.978 --> 34:46.347
Bar you.

34:46.415 --> 34:50.918
That's how pissed off I am.

34:50.985 --> 34:55.456
At least one of you has to get
the hell out of here tonight.

34:55.524 --> 34:57.925
<i>Get upstairs and think hard.</i>

34:57.993 --> 35:00.027
Two nominees for elimination.

35:00.095 --> 35:02.263
Do something together
for once tonight

35:02.331 --> 35:04.065
and cut the .

35:04.132 --> 35:08.369
Off, will you?

35:08.437 --> 35:10.204
It totally sucked tonight.

35:10.272 --> 35:11.906
Everybody across the board.

35:11.974 --> 35:13.474
And everybody's gonna
be pointing the finger

35:13.542 --> 35:14.976
at somebody else
and most of the fingers

35:15.043 --> 35:16.878
are gonna pointed
at app station

35:16.945 --> 35:19.380
and I got By having
a ditz on my line.

35:19.448 --> 35:22.216
<i>We all know apps really dragged</i>
<i>us down.</i>

35:22.284 --> 35:25.520
For me, I have to nominate
Trev and Sabrina.

35:25.587 --> 35:27.221
<i>I agree.</i>

35:27.289 --> 35:31.092
I feel like apps really
Up the whole kitchen.

35:31.159 --> 35:32.660
It's clear.

35:32.728 --> 35:34.695
To be honest, Trevor and Sabrina
are both bad cooks.

35:34.763 --> 35:36.197
I don't give a .
Send 'em both home.

35:36.265 --> 35:38.099
I mean, like,
that'd be optimal for me.

35:38.166 --> 35:40.902
You know, I fought through
that whole service.

35:40.969 --> 35:44.705
I'm saying Gail and Sabrina.

35:44.773 --> 35:46.774
I honestly think that Gail
was equally

35:46.842 --> 35:49.377
Up as Trevor.

35:49.444 --> 35:51.646
Trevor is a pansy-ass bitch

35:51.713 --> 35:54.916
and Gail's ruined the fish
station twice in a row.

35:54.983 --> 35:56.117
In a row!

35:56.184 --> 35:58.319
I don't deserve to go home.

35:58.387 --> 36:00.087
That's four.

36:00.155 --> 36:02.757
That's four and that's two.

36:02.824 --> 36:04.258
<i>Everybody voted except</i>
<i>for Nona.</i>

36:04.326 --> 36:06.294
So it's done.

36:06.361 --> 36:07.428
<i>Trev and Sabrina.</i>

36:07.496 --> 36:09.830
Can I say one thing to Gail?

36:09.898 --> 36:11.499
I don't feel like you
communicated with me at all

36:11.567 --> 36:14.335
tonight on the fish station.

36:14.403 --> 36:16.637
So what's your vote, Jillian?

36:16.705 --> 36:18.673
She already voted.
You can change it back though.

36:18.740 --> 36:20.575
No, you can't change your votes.

36:20.642 --> 36:21.909
We're not playing
the wishy-washy change votes.

36:21.977 --> 36:23.711
I'm not playing that.

36:23.779 --> 36:25.713
Russell, I don't know who
the You think you are.

36:25.781 --> 36:26.747
This could potentially
be my last night here

36:26.815 --> 36:31.519
in Hell's Kitchen.

36:31.587 --> 36:34.655
I'm very manipulative
and I'm just gonna do

36:34.723 --> 36:36.624
whatever I got to to stay here.

36:36.692 --> 36:40.761
I think that you should
put Gail up, Jillian.

36:40.829 --> 36:44.765
This is her second time crashing
on the fish station.

36:44.833 --> 36:46.067
And it is really easy,
dude.

36:46.134 --> 36:47.535
I got through the fish station.

36:47.603 --> 36:48.302
Dude, I got through the
meat station.

36:48.370 --> 36:50.037
I got through garnish.

36:50.105 --> 36:51.572
Like, I got through all these
things, you know?

36:51.640 --> 36:53.007
Russell doesn't
own this team.

36:53.075 --> 36:54.842
You even said yourself.
You said Gail.

36:54.910 --> 36:56.077
Sabrina's right.

36:56.144 --> 36:57.545
Gail's really experienced,

36:57.613 --> 36:59.380
but she sucks ass
in the kitchen

36:59.448 --> 37:02.617
and she didn't communicate
with me at all tonight.

37:02.684 --> 37:05.319
She really needs to go home.

37:05.387 --> 37:08.623
I'm changing my vote.

37:08.690 --> 37:12.393
I want to vote for Gail tonight
and not Sabrina.

37:12.461 --> 37:13.995
Wow.

37:14.062 --> 37:15.963
Jillian, what the
Are you doing?

37:16.031 --> 37:17.732
<i>So now it's tied three-three.</i>

37:17.799 --> 37:19.667
Nona, it's on you.

37:19.735 --> 37:22.637
I'm gonna have to go with...

37:22.704 --> 37:26.540
Um...

37:32.978 --> 37:35.847
Chef Ramsay's worst nightmare
came true

37:35.914 --> 37:38.115
when the six finalists he chose
were a complete

37:38.183 --> 37:41.319
embarrassment during
dinner service.

37:41.386 --> 37:44.489
And now, he will put an end
to one of their dreams.

37:44.556 --> 37:46.257
Sabrina, first nominee and why?

37:46.325 --> 37:47.592
Let's go.

37:47.659 --> 37:49.494
First nominee, Chef,
is Trevor,

37:49.561 --> 37:51.229
because he held apps.

37:51.296 --> 37:53.064
<i>He didn't get it out tonight.</i>

37:53.131 --> 37:54.565
And second nominee
and why, please?

37:54.633 --> 37:57.835
Our team decided that...

37:57.903 --> 37:59.937
Um, I should go up,

38:00.005 --> 38:03.941
because I didn't do well
in the app station at all.

38:04.009 --> 38:05.543
I tried to communicate,
but it just didn't work.

38:05.611 --> 38:07.512
Okay.

38:07.579 --> 38:10.481
Appetizer station step forward,
both of you.

38:14.920 --> 38:16.654
Partners in crime.

38:16.722 --> 38:18.723
<i>Trev, my patience</i>
<i>is running out with you.</i>

38:18.790 --> 38:20.157
Why do you think you should stay
in Hell's Kitchen?

38:20.225 --> 38:21.058
And hurry up.

38:21.126 --> 38:22.560
Tonight, I tried my damndest.

38:22.628 --> 38:23.761
I was fixing mistake
after mistake.

38:23.829 --> 38:25.129
Kept putting it out.

38:25.197 --> 38:26.731
Kept giving you
what you needed.

38:26.798 --> 38:28.366
I did not give up
on the kitchen or the team

38:28.433 --> 38:30.535
at all tonight whatsoever.

38:31.937 --> 38:34.972
Sabrina, you have been standing
in front of me

38:35.040 --> 38:38.242
for so Long,
you've molded my carpet.

38:38.310 --> 38:40.311
<i>Why do you think you should</i>
<i>stay in Hell's Kitchen?</i>

38:40.379 --> 38:41.879
I have never made
the same mistake twice.

38:41.947 --> 38:43.814
<i>I apologize about tonight.</i>

38:43.882 --> 38:45.483
I really do.
I tried to work with Trevor

38:45.551 --> 38:47.018
<i>and we don't get along,</i>

38:47.085 --> 38:48.986
but honestly, I think,
you know, that--

38:49.054 --> 38:52.056
I think Trevor should stay and I
think that I should stay

38:52.124 --> 38:54.592
and I think Gail should leave.

38:54.660 --> 38:56.994
What?

38:57.062 --> 38:59.497
She's messed up numerous
amounts of times

38:59.565 --> 39:00.998
and she's messed up
on the fish station.

39:01.066 --> 39:02.366
I'm fighting for Trevor.

39:02.434 --> 39:04.001
Like, that's really weird,
okay?

39:04.069 --> 39:05.836
And I just want you
to know that

39:05.904 --> 39:07.538
she's an executive Chef

39:07.606 --> 39:09.740
and she can't get through
the fish station.

39:09.808 --> 39:12.443
I just don't want
to go home, Chef.

39:12.511 --> 39:15.046
<i>I don't think that, like,</i>
<i>it's the right time yet.</i>

39:15.113 --> 39:17.281
<i>I messed up on the apps</i>
<i>and I'm sorry.</i>

39:17.349 --> 39:18.749
Just give me another chance
to show you

39:18.817 --> 39:21.485
that I won't mess it up again.

39:21.553 --> 39:23.287
Where do I go?

39:23.355 --> 39:24.522
Is it both of you?

39:25.624 --> 39:26.924
Hope not.

39:26.992 --> 39:31.596
My decision is...

39:31.663 --> 39:32.663
Sabrina.

39:32.731 --> 39:36.367
<i>Give me your jacket.</i>

39:36.435 --> 39:39.870
You have got a big heart,
you work exceptionally hard,

39:39.938 --> 39:41.772
but...

39:41.840 --> 39:43.608
Young lady, you have a lot
of growing up to do

39:43.675 --> 39:46.611
inside the kitchen
and outside.

39:46.678 --> 39:47.912
Yes, Chef.
Thank you for your commitment.

39:47.980 --> 39:49.013
Thank you, Chef.

39:49.081 --> 39:51.582
I wish you the best
of luck.

39:55.520 --> 39:58.389
I came here in <i>Hell's Kitchen</i>
not knowing anything

39:58.457 --> 40:00.391
about how a brigade works.

40:00.459 --> 40:02.093
What the
Is this doing here?

40:02.160 --> 40:03.394
I don't know.
I'm sorry, Chef.

40:03.462 --> 40:05.863
Being 22, I am a bit immature.

40:05.931 --> 40:08.132
That's fine!
Take a breath.

40:08.200 --> 40:10.001
There is a lot that I have
to learn about life.

40:10.068 --> 40:11.636
You're all talk.
You're all talk.

40:11.703 --> 40:13.337
Just check the attitude.

40:13.405 --> 40:15.339
But I'm leaving <i>Hell's Kitchen</i>
as a fighter.

40:15.407 --> 40:16.507
I fought from day one.

40:16.575 --> 40:17.775
Why else should I go home?

40:17.843 --> 40:19.310
I fought with Chef Ramsay.

40:19.378 --> 40:20.911
She's given up.
No, I haven't, Chef!

40:20.979 --> 40:22.446
I fought with everybody.

40:22.514 --> 40:23.748
You ain't done better
than me at all!

40:23.815 --> 40:25.082
At all!

40:25.150 --> 40:27.184
Calm down your little
ghetto attitude.

40:27.252 --> 40:29.186
I gave it everything that I had.

40:29.254 --> 40:30.755
Sabrina, finally,
the pork cooked perfectly.

40:30.822 --> 40:32.490
This experience has definitely

40:32.557 --> 40:33.991
changed my life forever.

40:34.059 --> 40:35.526
I'm so happy.

40:35.594 --> 40:37.828
I'm definitely gonna continue
on this path,

40:37.896 --> 40:39.830
wherever it takes me.

40:39.898 --> 40:43.034
Chef Ramsay hasn't
seen the last of me.

40:43.101 --> 40:45.569
Trevor, back in line.

40:45.637 --> 40:47.038
Gail, wake up.

40:47.105 --> 40:48.305
Yes, Chef.

40:48.373 --> 40:50.908
Get out.

40:50.976 --> 40:52.076
Good night, Chef.
Night, Chef.

40:52.144 --> 40:53.544
Far from a good night.

40:53.612 --> 40:54.912
I dodged the bus
that Sabrina tried

40:54.980 --> 40:56.514
to throw me under tonight.

40:56.581 --> 40:57.982
There's only five of us left.

40:58.050 --> 40:59.850
I got to kick some ass.

40:59.918 --> 41:02.086
I really have to show
my stuff tomorrow.

41:02.154 --> 41:05.956
I cannot let myself do
what I did today at all

41:06.024 --> 41:07.658
the rest of the competition.

41:07.726 --> 41:10.761
Hands down.
I just have to be spot on.

41:10.829 --> 41:13.297
Oh, my God.
This is the last hurdle.

41:13.365 --> 41:14.665
This is it.

41:14.733 --> 41:17.902
Four more people standing
in my way.

41:17.969 --> 41:20.604
I can see L.A. Market from here.

41:22.441 --> 41:25.042
Sabrina was quite dramatic
in her final plea,

41:25.110 --> 41:26.610
but I'm not looking
for a drama queen.

41:26.678 --> 41:29.547
I'm looking for a head Chef.

41:34.119 --> 41:35.920
The winner of <i>Hell's Kitchen</i>

41:35.987 --> 41:37.688
will become head Chef
of the brand-new

41:37.756 --> 41:39.790
multimillion-dollar restaurant
L.A. Market

41:39.858 --> 41:42.593
at the J.W. Marriott Hotel
in downtown Los Angeles.

41:42.661 --> 41:45.029
The salary: $1/4 million.

41:46.998 --> 41:48.999
And they will also
tour the country

41:49.067 --> 41:51.368
as the official spokesperson
of Rosemount Estate Winery.

41:51.436 --> 41:53.437
Next time on <i>Hell's Kitchen...</i>

41:53.505 --> 41:55.206
Every man and woman
for themselves right now.

41:55.273 --> 41:57.174
This is serious business.

41:57.242 --> 41:58.676
The final five talk
a big game...

41:58.744 --> 42:00.211
I'm running this .

42:00.278 --> 42:01.479
If anybody's standing
in my way,

42:01.546 --> 42:02.813
they're just gonna have
to get out.

42:02.881 --> 42:03.948
But better

42:04.015 --> 42:04.949
at running their mouths...

42:05.016 --> 42:06.083
I'll make it happen
in five minutes.

42:06.151 --> 42:07.585
I'm goona tell you every minute.

42:07.652 --> 42:08.552
Than running their stations.

42:08.620 --> 42:09.920
This is .

42:09.988 --> 42:12.523
<i>Overcooked scallops</i>
<i>and crunchy spaghetti.</i>

42:12.591 --> 42:14.191
What are we doing here?

42:14.259 --> 42:15.493
When one Chef goes too far...

42:15.560 --> 42:19.497
Four more beef on order.

42:19.564 --> 42:21.532
Welling--
no, you can't sell that.

42:21.600 --> 42:23.200
And tries to take over
Hell's Kitchen.

42:23.268 --> 42:24.668
Let's go!
Just shut your mouth.

42:24.736 --> 42:25.836
Don't tell me what to do.

42:25.904 --> 42:27.238
How rude are you?

42:27.305 --> 42:29.140
You won't believe...

42:29.207 --> 42:30.708
Chef Ramsay's
shocking reaction.

42:30.776 --> 42:32.676
Bunch of Idiots.

42:32.744 --> 42:34.779
I'm done.

42:34.846 --> 42:35.780
Oh, my God.

42:35.847 --> 42:39.283
Good luck, superstars.

42:39.351 --> 42:40.384
I've got to get out.

42:40.452 --> 42:42.052
We are .

42:42.120 --> 42:43.521
Oh.

42:43.588 --> 42:44.889
Oh, man.

42:44.956 --> 42:46.123
It just gets more
and more humiliating.

42:46.191 --> 42:47.591
Come on!

42:47.659 --> 42:49.560
This is over.
Over.

42:49.628 --> 42:51.896
It's all next time
on <i>Hell's Kitchen.</i>

42:51.963 --> 42:54.031
Do somebody some damage
if I stay in there.
