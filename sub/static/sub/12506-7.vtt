WEBVTT

00:05.773 --> 00:07.575
[Kaylie] Previously on
Make It or Break It:

00:07.608 --> 00:09.443
You've done nothing
but drag me down

00:09.477 --> 00:11.545
ever since I freaking
fell for you and lost myself.

00:11.579 --> 00:14.282
I have no interest
in being Mr. Kaylie Cruz.

00:14.315 --> 00:16.317
I thought we were best friends
back at camp.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.752
Then all of a sudden,
Coach Keegan started
treating you as his pet

00:18.786 --> 00:20.521
and you left me in the dust!

00:20.554 --> 00:22.590
Lauren, you have
a particularly rare form

00:22.623 --> 00:24.325
of a heart rhythm disorder.

00:25.693 --> 00:28.129
...my friend, Lauren Tanner
desperately needs your help.

00:28.162 --> 00:29.463
[Kevin] This is
uncharted territory.

00:29.497 --> 00:31.699
An athlete's heart is very
different from a normal heart.

00:31.732 --> 00:34.402
I'm so lucky I found
someone like you.

00:34.435 --> 00:36.637
[Rigo] I feel
just as lucky.

00:44.812 --> 00:47.681
[heartbeat]

00:47.715 --> 00:51.752
[Payson]
So her heart is... broken?

00:51.785 --> 00:53.654
More like her heart is unique.

00:53.687 --> 00:55.089
Just like me.

00:55.123 --> 00:57.758
[Kevin] The average heart beats
somewhere between

00:57.791 --> 00:59.493
sixty to 90 times
per minute.

00:59.527 --> 01:01.662
Occasionally, in Lauren's case,
it beats much faster,

01:01.695 --> 01:04.465
resulting in less time
for the heart muscle to relax

01:04.498 --> 01:08.736
between contractions, ultimately
causing her black outs.

01:08.769 --> 01:12.306
And you don't need to cut her
open to fix this?

01:12.340 --> 01:14.242
The procedure is done
intravenously.

01:14.275 --> 01:16.244
We'll insert a catheter
through her veins

01:16.277 --> 01:18.379
and transmit radio
waves directly to her heart,

01:18.412 --> 01:20.648
changing its electrical rhythm.

01:22.183 --> 01:25.486
Most of my patients have had
positive results with this
procedure,

01:25.519 --> 01:29.056
and they're able to return
to their lives within a matter
of days.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.691
Have I answered
all your questions?

01:30.724 --> 01:32.326
- Thank you, doctor.
- You're welcome.

01:32.360 --> 01:33.627
I'll check in with you later.

01:36.497 --> 01:38.199
- Yes.
- [both giggle]

01:39.767 --> 01:41.735
- [door closes]
- [exhales]

01:41.769 --> 01:43.437
[* Jules Larson:
"Almost Blows My Mind"]

01:43.471 --> 01:46.474
[Jordan sighs] The meals here
taste like cardboard slop.

01:46.507 --> 01:49.710
Now, chicken enchiladas
with mole sauce,

01:49.743 --> 01:51.212
that's some serious eating.

01:51.245 --> 01:53.347
Well, if that cardboard slop
can help me land

01:53.381 --> 01:55.749
a full twist
dismount on vault,

01:55.783 --> 01:58.252
I would eat it
breakfast, lunch and dinner.

01:58.286 --> 02:01.088
You'll get it. We can work
on it in practice.

02:01.121 --> 02:04.091
Wait, are you actually
offering to help me?

02:04.124 --> 02:07.161
- [Jordan laughs] I can be nice!
- [Kaylie] Really?

02:07.195 --> 02:09.430
Besides, if I have to be stuck
with you in London

02:09.463 --> 02:10.831
you'd better be
burning that vault.

02:10.864 --> 02:13.867
Is that Kaylie Cruz
and Jordan Randall?

02:13.901 --> 02:16.804
Oh, my God, look at you two,
you're all grown up.

02:16.837 --> 02:18.839
Coach Ray? Is that really you?!

02:18.872 --> 02:20.808
- Last time I checked.
- [laughing] Oh, my God!

02:20.841 --> 02:23.511
Uh, how's the Florida camp?

02:23.544 --> 02:25.346
Do you still have
that crazy petting zoo?

02:25.379 --> 02:28.716
The watering hole, the petting
zoo, exactly as you left it.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.753
- Hey, Jordan!
- Hey. What are you doing here?

02:32.786 --> 02:35.556
Welcome to the USA Training
Center, Coach Keegan.

02:35.589 --> 02:37.791
Coach McIntire.
I'm a huge fan of yours.

02:37.825 --> 02:39.827
Likewise. We're lucky
to have you.

02:39.860 --> 02:41.729
Wait, are you
working with us?

02:41.762 --> 02:43.564
- For how long?
- Ah, ah, ah!

02:43.597 --> 02:45.866
You'll just have to wait until
tomorrow for the announcement.

02:46.934 --> 02:48.769
Until tomorrow, ladies.

02:48.802 --> 02:50.571
[chuckles] Bye.

02:50.604 --> 02:54.742
That was a blast from the past.
Did you know he was coming?

02:54.775 --> 02:57.878
I had no idea.

02:57.911 --> 02:59.747
* It almost blows my mind *

02:59.780 --> 03:01.649
Nice jammies.

03:01.682 --> 03:04.918
If you're big game
hunting, I surrender.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.854
Are you seriously
making fun of me

03:06.887 --> 03:08.822
the night before
I have heart surgery?

03:08.856 --> 03:13.227
[exhales sharply]
Get over yourself, Tanner.

03:13.261 --> 03:16.630
I plan on making your life
miserable all the way to London.

03:16.664 --> 03:18.299
You should be so lucky.

03:18.332 --> 03:20.434
Hey, I've got Otis, remember?

03:20.468 --> 03:21.902
I don't need any more
luck than that.

03:23.304 --> 03:25.639
- Hi.
- Uh, thank God!

03:25.673 --> 03:27.341
I've been trying to
get rid of him for an hour.

03:27.375 --> 03:31.645
I think I've hit her last nerve.
My job here is done.

03:31.679 --> 03:33.914
You two take care of
my favorite Barbie, OK?

03:37.818 --> 03:39.219
[clears throat]

03:40.954 --> 03:42.956
What's with the cute guy
glued to your bedside?

03:42.990 --> 03:46.294
Please, he just came by
to rub Otis in my face.

03:46.327 --> 03:50.831
- Sure, that's exactly why
he was here for an entire hour.
- Oh, yeah.

03:50.864 --> 03:53.734
That meathead is not
Lauren Tanner approved.

03:53.767 --> 03:55.536
[laughing]

03:55.569 --> 03:59.307
And besides, Payson's the one
we should be grilling for deets.

03:59.340 --> 04:01.309
What's up with lover boy?

04:01.342 --> 04:02.976
What happened?

04:03.010 --> 04:04.978
We made love in a tent
in his dorm room.

04:06.347 --> 04:07.748
It was pretty romantic.

04:07.781 --> 04:09.617
You traded in your V-card?

04:09.650 --> 04:12.586
- How was it?
- Amazing.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.588
See, don't you wish you came
into the fold sooner?

04:14.622 --> 04:15.856
No. Not at all.

04:15.889 --> 04:17.825
I wasn't ready before this.

04:17.858 --> 04:20.961
I grew up a lot this year,
I'm a different person now.

04:20.994 --> 04:22.896
It happened because I waited

04:22.930 --> 04:25.933
and being with Rigo
made it special.

04:25.966 --> 04:28.436
That's... That's great, Pay.

04:28.469 --> 04:31.004
I'm sorry, Kaylie. We don't need
to talk about this right now

04:31.038 --> 04:33.974
- if you don't want to.
- Hello? Yeah, we do.

04:35.876 --> 04:37.445
It's fine.

04:37.478 --> 04:39.413
Just because Austin
and I broke up

04:39.447 --> 04:42.816
doesn't mean I don't want to
know what's going on with you.

04:42.850 --> 04:45.486
Payson Keeler isn't
a virgin anymore.

04:45.519 --> 04:47.955
I always thought you'd be next,
Kaylie, like, really,

04:47.988 --> 04:50.858
who would've thought that
Payson would've beat you
to the cherry pop?

04:50.891 --> 04:52.993
- [Payson] Lauren!
- [Lauren chuckles]

04:53.026 --> 04:55.996
Dr. Walker. Hi.

04:56.029 --> 04:59.533
Did I tell you I'm going to
dedicate my gold medal to you
when I kill it in London?

04:59.567 --> 05:01.902
- Modest, isn't she?
- [Lauren laughs]

05:01.935 --> 05:03.404
We'll see you tomorrow, Lo.

05:03.437 --> 05:04.872
[Payson] Dr. Walker,

05:04.905 --> 05:08.041
we just wanted to thank you
again for doing Lauren's
surgery.

05:08.075 --> 05:10.511
- Oh...
- Yeah, you really have no idea

05:10.544 --> 05:13.280
what it means to all of us
to have her back on the team.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.715
Bye.

05:17.951 --> 05:21.422
That kind of positive energy
is gonna be a big help during
your recovery.

05:21.455 --> 05:25.025
They'll be an even
bigger help in getting me
back in shape at the gym.

05:25.058 --> 05:26.927
Lauren,

05:26.960 --> 05:31.799
I want to be clear, this surgery
is not a miracle cure.

05:31.832 --> 05:34.301
There's a reason I didn't
originally consider you
as a candidate.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.070
But I'm a candidate now, so...

05:37.104 --> 05:38.672
We have no idea how your heart's
going to react

05:38.706 --> 05:40.441
until after
the procedure's done.

05:40.474 --> 05:42.943
But I'll be recovered in time
to compete for Trials, right?

05:42.976 --> 05:46.013
I mean, you said most of your
patients are back to normal
within days.

05:46.046 --> 05:47.080
You're not most patients.

05:47.114 --> 05:49.450
You're an entirely new
test subject,

05:49.483 --> 05:52.420
and I'm afraid I can't
make you any promises.

05:52.986 --> 05:56.056
In fact, Lauren,

05:56.089 --> 05:59.660
there's a very real chance
you won't be ready in time.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.702
[crowd cheering]

06:19.780 --> 06:21.081
Good morning, Wendy.

06:21.114 --> 06:23.984
You know, you could have left
your drug screening sample

06:24.017 --> 06:26.086
in the bathroom,
like the rest of the girls do.

06:26.119 --> 06:29.523
Actually, I was hoping
you can go over the banned
substances with me.

06:29.557 --> 06:32.092
I think I'm getting a cold,
but I'd hate to take something

06:32.125 --> 06:33.927
that I'm not supposed to.

06:33.961 --> 06:35.629
You know, now that
we're close to Trials

06:35.663 --> 06:38.566
I assume Coach wants us
randomly screened more often,

06:38.599 --> 06:39.900
don't ya think?

06:39.933 --> 06:42.135
Better to be safe than sorry.

06:42.169 --> 06:45.138
You should always read
the ingredients on the box

06:45.172 --> 06:46.540
before taking anything,

06:46.574 --> 06:50.444
but make sure not to take
any of these flu meds.

06:50.478 --> 06:54.114
One of the main active
ingredients is pseudoephedrine.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.551
And that would be bad, right?

06:57.585 --> 06:59.987
If you get caught with that
in your system,

07:00.020 --> 07:01.755
it would be
automatic elimination.

07:01.789 --> 07:02.823
Hm.

07:02.856 --> 07:05.025
So, take in lots of fluids

07:05.058 --> 07:06.794
and get lots of extra rest.

07:06.827 --> 07:07.995
Thanks Mrs. M!

07:14.101 --> 07:15.803
- Is that Coach Ray?
- Mm-hm.

07:15.836 --> 07:18.472
I remember you telling me
about how much fun you used
to have

07:18.506 --> 07:19.773
at his rhythmic camp
when you were a kid.

07:19.807 --> 07:21.108
Coach Ray is the reason

07:21.141 --> 07:22.843
why I fell in love
with gymnastics.

07:22.876 --> 07:24.912
Obviously he is a great coach.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.680
Didn't he help you create
your famous "layout Jordan?"

07:26.714 --> 07:28.048
[McIntire] Listen up, ladies.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.119
Olympic Trials are
right around the corner.

07:32.152 --> 07:34.187
To help punch up
your floor routines,

07:34.221 --> 07:36.089
the NGO has been kind
enough to send us

07:36.123 --> 07:39.660
expert choreographer,
Coach Ray Keegan.

07:39.693 --> 07:42.630
[applause, cheers]

07:44.464 --> 07:46.133
Thanks Coach, um...

07:46.166 --> 07:49.069
First off, I want to say
it's an honor to be here.

07:49.102 --> 07:51.171
I'm here to help you
in any way I can,

07:51.204 --> 07:54.542
even if it's just to be
a fresh pair of eyes

07:54.575 --> 07:55.709
on a routine.

07:55.743 --> 07:57.210
I'm staying on campus all week.

07:57.244 --> 08:01.181
I'm available to you 24/7.
My door is always open.

08:01.214 --> 08:03.884
[McIntire] OK, ladies,
let's get to it.

08:07.755 --> 08:09.456
Oh my, what is your name?

08:09.489 --> 08:10.758
Wendy Capshaw!

08:10.791 --> 08:14.628
Wendy Capshaw.
Show me what you got.

08:16.897 --> 08:19.166
- What's up?
- Austin broke up with Kaylie.

08:19.199 --> 08:21.134
- No way...
- Hey.

08:21.168 --> 08:24.171
I guess word travels fast when
the golden couple shatters.

08:26.574 --> 08:29.677
So, how are you doing since
boy wonder bounced?

08:29.710 --> 08:32.646
He didn't just bounce,
he basically said
I destroyed his life.

08:32.680 --> 08:35.482
Well, that gives you credit.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.217
[scoffs]

08:37.250 --> 08:38.786
According to him,
the only reason anybody

08:38.819 --> 08:41.221
was interested in him
was because of me.

08:41.254 --> 08:46.193
And he has no interest
in being "Mr. Cruz."

08:46.226 --> 08:50.063
You know, it's kind of funny
how we spend all this time

08:50.097 --> 08:51.899
trying to be perfect
and win,

08:51.932 --> 08:55.669
and then when we get there,
it just alienates people.

08:58.271 --> 09:00.140
[scoffs] OK, look, sorry,

09:00.173 --> 09:03.577
I'm not really used to
this girlfriend thing.

09:05.579 --> 09:07.915
You're really lucky
to have Payson and Lauren.

09:07.948 --> 09:09.549
[scoffs] Yeah, well,

09:09.583 --> 09:11.752
I'm not about to pull Payson
off of her cloud nine

09:11.785 --> 09:14.888
and Lauren... she's got bigger
problems than I do.

09:16.323 --> 09:19.727
I'm fine.
I'll totally get over it.

09:21.995 --> 09:23.631
Yeah, you will,

09:23.664 --> 09:25.733
but that doesn't mean you have
to put up with these snots.

09:25.766 --> 09:29.002
Yo, beat it
unless you want one.

09:33.306 --> 09:34.908
[scoffs]

09:36.209 --> 09:39.847
- Thank you.
- No problem.

09:39.880 --> 09:42.049
Look, you should really put some
of that hurt you're feeling

09:42.082 --> 09:43.316
in your routines.

09:43.350 --> 09:46.219
Let it drive you.
That's what I do.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.294
Whoopsie!

09:54.327 --> 09:58.999
Your leg was bent on that one.
It's OK, I got a fix for that.

09:59.032 --> 10:03.336
All right, now, show me your
grand battement to the front.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.372
All right,
arabesque back.

10:07.240 --> 10:10.644
- Now... Feel that?
- Mm-hm.

10:10.678 --> 10:14.347
You need to feel that
when you leap.

10:14.381 --> 10:16.249
- Got it?
- Mm-hm.

10:16.283 --> 10:18.218
- OK.
- [exhales]

10:18.251 --> 10:20.187
You're good, Wendy,

10:20.220 --> 10:23.356
but you need to be flawless
with this kind of competition.

10:23.390 --> 10:25.993
Speaking of the C word,

10:26.026 --> 10:29.162
of all the girls here,
if you had to guess,

10:29.196 --> 10:31.699
who would you say would be
my biggest competition?

10:32.766 --> 10:34.668
That's really not
my place to say.

10:34.702 --> 10:37.270
I'm sorry, I don't mean to
put you in a pickle.

10:37.304 --> 10:42.609
I just kind of want a
hint so I can use it as a
learning tool, you know?

10:42.642 --> 10:44.344
Someone to look up to.

10:44.377 --> 10:47.314
Well, if I had to guess,
I'd say Kaylie Cruz.

10:47.347 --> 10:48.816
She's your top gun here.

10:48.849 --> 10:51.919
Even when she was a kid,
I could tell that

10:51.952 --> 10:53.921
she was destined for
the Olympics.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.190
It'll be our little secret.

11:00.260 --> 11:03.663
Jordan, your turn to work
with Coach Keegan.

11:04.965 --> 11:07.067
Sorry Coach. Not enough time.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.036
I took longer than I thought
with Wendy.

11:09.069 --> 11:12.706
And I, uh, I have an appointment
with the physical therapist.

11:12.740 --> 11:15.208
I overdid it on bars.
My shoulder's been acting up.

11:15.242 --> 11:18.311
Hey, I want you stretching
more each morning.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.013
- You got it?
- Mm-hm.

11:20.047 --> 11:21.048
OK.

11:24.684 --> 11:27.788
I've been working on her
attitude but, man, it has been
a challenge.

11:27.821 --> 11:31.424
One minute she seems engaged
and part of the team and the
next...

11:31.458 --> 11:32.659
Well, you know
how competitive she is.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.262
Yeah, it's an amazing asset.

11:35.295 --> 11:39.399
The problem with Jordan
is that not only is she
competitive with herself,

11:39.432 --> 11:40.400
like most gymnasts are,

11:40.433 --> 11:42.269
but she's competitive
with the other girls.

11:42.302 --> 11:46.173
She has a jealous streak
that can make sportsmanship
a challenge for her.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.407
Have you noticed that?

11:47.440 --> 11:50.911
Hmm. I never thought of it
as jealousy.

11:50.944 --> 11:54.014
Just watch her reaction
when you start to invest
in the other girls.

11:54.047 --> 11:57.017
Now, it's understandable
because,

11:57.050 --> 12:00.020
the poor girl, she's had
so little in her life.

12:00.053 --> 12:02.389
I've been trying to get her
to do the layout Jordan

12:02.422 --> 12:05.125
and she absolutely
refuses to every time.

12:07.027 --> 12:08.295
I created that move with her.

12:08.328 --> 12:10.463
Let me try to get her to do it.

12:10.497 --> 12:14.701
That would be a huge help.
I'm glad you're here, Ray.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.069
Glad to be here.

12:19.139 --> 12:21.141
[Steve] And don't you worry
for one minute, honey,

12:21.174 --> 12:24.311
you're gonna be just fine, it'll
all be over before you know it.

12:24.344 --> 12:27.147
- I know, Daddy.
- Everything will be,
you know, fine.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.716
- Wait! Hold on!
- You're here.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.351
Of course.
We're in this together.

12:31.384 --> 12:34.922
- We love you, Lo.
- I love you guys too.

12:38.525 --> 12:41.895
OK. Time for us
to let Dr. Walker

12:41.929 --> 12:44.064
work his magic on our girl.

12:45.498 --> 12:47.534
- Bye. OK.
- It's gonna be all right.

13:13.961 --> 13:15.795
Everything went smoothly.

13:15.829 --> 13:18.531
She's resting now, but she'll
be able to leave the hospital

13:18.565 --> 13:21.268
- as soon as she wakes up.
- That's such great news.

13:21.301 --> 13:24.071
We gave her an echocardiogram
after her surgery.

13:24.104 --> 13:25.873
It showed us that currently,

13:25.906 --> 13:29.242
her heart is still exhibiting
random abnormalities in its
rhythm.

13:29.276 --> 13:32.145
I want her to come in for a
daily cardiac stress test

13:32.179 --> 13:34.481
for the next 72 hours
to see if that rhythm

13:34.514 --> 13:36.049
is her new heartbeat.

13:36.083 --> 13:37.951
Well, does that mean
she's still sick?

13:37.985 --> 13:39.386
There's no need for concern yet,

13:39.419 --> 13:42.222
I've seen this before
in non-athletic patients
post-surgery.

13:42.255 --> 13:44.291
And they turned out
better than ever, right?

13:44.324 --> 13:47.227
They're leading healthy,
perfectly normal lives.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.262
What if...

13:49.296 --> 13:52.499
What if normal
isn't good enough?

14:21.228 --> 14:23.230
[classical music playing]

14:36.243 --> 14:39.146
Your Swan Lake gets
more and more beautiful

14:39.179 --> 14:40.213
each time you perform.

14:40.247 --> 14:41.881
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

14:41.915 --> 14:43.250
'Cause I'm worried it's
starting to get a little stale.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.285
I was thinking if I came out
of the two and a half

14:45.318 --> 14:47.154
- with a leap...
- Don't worry about
the flash, Payson,

14:47.187 --> 14:49.422
your strength is the dance,
not the tumbling.

14:49.456 --> 14:52.092
But my routine
would be stronger.

14:52.125 --> 14:54.394
Stick with this routine.
It's consistent.

14:54.427 --> 14:57.097
That's what Coach McIntire
and the NGO

14:57.130 --> 14:58.531
want from their
leadoff position.

14:58.565 --> 15:01.969
[stammers] I've never been
a leadoff position.

15:02.002 --> 15:04.537
Ever. I was always
the person sent out last,

15:04.571 --> 15:05.572
to take home the win.

15:05.605 --> 15:07.574
I'm only going off the intel

15:07.607 --> 15:09.342
I was given by your coach.

15:09.376 --> 15:10.243
Is there a problem, Payson?

15:10.277 --> 15:11.478
Yeah, is it true?

15:11.511 --> 15:13.280
Do you consider me
a leadoff position?

15:14.381 --> 15:16.116
Coach, give us a minute, OK?

15:16.149 --> 15:17.284
Sure thing.

15:19.152 --> 15:20.653
If you were to
make it to London,

15:20.687 --> 15:23.356
then yes, I see you
as our girl

15:23.390 --> 15:25.125
to start the competition
ball rolling.

15:25.158 --> 15:28.028
Coach, I'm better
than the gymnast

15:28.061 --> 15:31.231
that just goes out there
and sets the bar for everyone
else to surpass.

15:31.264 --> 15:34.334
I have what it takes
to be an anchor.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.037
Look...

15:38.538 --> 15:40.540
Ever since your back surgery,

15:40.573 --> 15:42.542
you've been performing
consistent routines

15:42.575 --> 15:44.177
that bring in good scores,

15:44.211 --> 15:46.013
but they're not
anchor-level scores.

15:46.046 --> 15:48.181
Now, you may have been able
to anchor in Boulder,

15:48.215 --> 15:49.983
but if you make it to London,

15:50.017 --> 15:52.385
what you've been bringing
won't cut it.

15:52.419 --> 15:54.421
Then train me harder.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.556
Please. Just let me do
a stronger floor routine.

15:56.589 --> 16:00.260
Payson, I'm not telling you this
to discourage you.

16:00.293 --> 16:03.430
I think you have an excellent
shot at making the US Team.

16:03.463 --> 16:07.267
That's why I've been grooming
you to be our leadoff.

16:07.300 --> 16:11.138
It's the best spot for our
consistently safe performer.

16:13.340 --> 16:15.675
You think I'm safe?

16:18.411 --> 16:20.180
Everyone going to London

16:20.213 --> 16:22.149
will be there as part of a team.

16:22.182 --> 16:23.983
The only important thing then

16:24.017 --> 16:26.353
is for you to have the best
performance of your life

16:26.386 --> 16:29.222
and help your country win gold.

16:33.693 --> 16:36.196
Not only does he not see me
as the star of the team,

16:36.229 --> 16:37.730
he doesn't even think I'm good
enough to raise the bar

16:37.764 --> 16:40.300
- in the middle of the
competition.
- Maybe he'll change his mind.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.702
To him, I'm just
a sacrificial lamb.

16:42.735 --> 16:45.305
I am the gymnast you send out
to the judges for slaughter!

16:45.338 --> 16:48.308
OK, let's put this down.

16:48.341 --> 16:51.078
Look, Pay,

16:51.111 --> 16:53.980
I know that that was hard
for you to hear

16:54.013 --> 16:56.049
but did you consider
what else he said?

16:56.083 --> 16:58.651
I mean, Coach McIntire
practically said

16:58.685 --> 17:00.753
that you have a spot
on the 2012 Team.

17:00.787 --> 17:06.159
Of course, to go to London
at all would be amazing, but...

17:06.193 --> 17:09.662
But gymnastics isn't just about
team medaling. I get it.

17:09.696 --> 17:11.564
We both know that
the leadoff position

17:11.598 --> 17:13.366
never wins
an individual medal.

17:13.400 --> 17:16.336
And I have sacrificed so much.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.805
I want a gold medal.
No one here wants it more!

17:21.040 --> 17:24.544
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Kaylie.
I'm all worked up here.

17:24.577 --> 17:25.578
Yeah.

17:27.514 --> 17:29.616
You know what feels weird to me?

17:29.649 --> 17:32.051
For the last ten years,

17:32.085 --> 17:34.487
all we've talked about
is getting there together.

17:34.521 --> 17:37.424
"We'll make it
to Nationals together,

17:37.457 --> 17:40.260
to Worlds together,
to the Olympics together."

17:41.494 --> 17:44.464
But we all can't stand on top
of that platform together.

17:44.497 --> 17:46.499
There's only one gold medal.

17:48.535 --> 17:51.471
- Hi, girls.
- Hi! You're back!

17:51.504 --> 17:53.473
I thought you were
still recovering.

17:53.506 --> 17:55.208
I wasn't spending one more day

17:55.242 --> 17:58.411
staring at that tacky wallpaper
in my dad's hotel room.

17:58.445 --> 18:02.449
Besides, I can practically
hear the beam calling my name.

18:02.482 --> 18:05.318
- [sighs]
- Tanner, my office.

18:05.352 --> 18:07.254
Get ready to get
your butts kicked.

18:07.287 --> 18:09.156

the Beam is back.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.828
She's been out of the gym
a long time.

18:15.862 --> 18:17.464
Yeah.

18:17.497 --> 18:19.232
She'll just have to train
that much harder

18:19.266 --> 18:20.633
to fight her way back.

by the look on your face.

18:30.243 --> 18:32.679

to talk about Austin...

18:32.712 --> 18:35.248
- I'm fine.
- I know you are.

18:35.282 --> 18:37.850
And you'll find true
love too, I know it.

18:43.256 --> 18:44.557
Thanks, Pay.

18:45.758 --> 18:48.395
You can't kick me out,
my surgery worked!

18:48.428 --> 18:49.829
Dr. Walker told me himself,

18:49.862 --> 18:52.799
he does not want you doing
any strenuous exercise

18:52.832 --> 18:55.602
until he's positive
your heart can handle it.

18:55.635 --> 18:58.371
OK, fine, then give me a day.
When can I be back? Tomorrow?

18:58.405 --> 18:59.772
When your doctor
gives me the OK.

18:59.806 --> 19:01.708
Until then,
I can't have you here.

19:01.741 --> 19:04.143
This is crazy!
If I can't work out,

19:04.177 --> 19:06.413
how am I gonna be ready
in time for Olympic Trials?

19:06.446 --> 19:07.680
You won't be.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.718
Look, I know it's not fair,
but the truth is,

19:11.751 --> 19:13.853
injuries and illnesses
keep other gymnasts

19:13.886 --> 19:15.622
out of the game
all the time.

19:15.655 --> 19:18.691
But I am not
any other gymnast.

19:18.725 --> 19:21.461

- You can't do this to me!

19:21.494 --> 19:25.898

[Payson] Can you please tell me
what we're doing here?

24:17.824 --> 24:19.759
- I feel ridiculous.
- Shh.

24:19.792 --> 24:22.094
Calm heart.

24:22.128 --> 24:24.931
That is what I need
to pass those stress tests

24:24.964 --> 24:26.833
and that's what I need
to get back in the gym.

24:29.168 --> 24:31.504
He is like seriously
good at this.

24:31.538 --> 24:33.540
Apparently, a man
of many talents.

24:34.874 --> 24:36.475
What? I'm just saying.

24:36.509 --> 24:38.578
There is nothing going on
between us.

24:38.611 --> 24:41.013
Trust me. Jake said
this was how the wrestlers

24:41.047 --> 24:43.750
would find their centers
before matches,

24:43.783 --> 24:45.518
so I figured it was
worth a try.

24:45.552 --> 24:47.920
Just be patient, Lo.
You'll get there. I know it.

24:47.954 --> 24:49.556
I have no time to be patient.

24:49.589 --> 24:51.658
If Dr. Walker doesn't give me
a clean bill of health,

24:51.691 --> 24:53.526
then Coach McIntire
won't let me train

24:53.560 --> 24:54.761
and I won't be ready
for Trials.

24:54.794 --> 24:56.563
Well then, that's not an option.

24:56.596 --> 24:58.731
If calm is what you need,
then calm is what you get.

24:58.765 --> 25:02.468
Yeah, we got your back, Lo.
Every step of the way.

25:02.501 --> 25:03.870
Ladies, please!

25:03.903 --> 25:05.638
Less talking more Zen.

25:05.672 --> 25:08.107
We're all warrior
athletes here.

25:21.287 --> 25:23.089
- OK, Lauren, you can stop now.
- Oh.

25:23.122 --> 25:25.958
That was nothing, I feel great,
I can keep going if you want
me to.

25:25.992 --> 25:27.894
You're still experiencing
some abnormal spikes,

25:27.927 --> 25:28.895
we don't want to push things.

25:28.928 --> 25:30.697
Oh, but I'm fine, I swear.

25:30.730 --> 25:32.732
I actually didn't get
any symptoms at all.

25:32.765 --> 25:35.668
That's because I stopped you
before you had too many
consecutive spikes.

25:35.702 --> 25:37.570
You keep saying that.

25:37.604 --> 25:39.639
I know.

25:39.672 --> 25:40.973
Your heart needs
longer to heal.

25:41.007 --> 25:43.109
Trust me, you're getting
stronger every day.

25:43.142 --> 25:46.045
Far faster than any other
patient I've ever had.

25:46.078 --> 25:48.280
But not fast enough.

25:48.314 --> 25:50.116
If Lauren weren't
a professional athlete,

25:50.149 --> 25:53.519
- would you say she's fine?
- Yes, technically,

25:53.552 --> 25:55.688
if she was just going to be
working a desk job

25:55.722 --> 25:58.658
or going grocery shopping,
then there wouldn't be any need
for this concern.

25:58.691 --> 26:01.227
But I'm running out of time.
I might be able to get through

26:01.260 --> 26:03.529
a whole routine without
my heart freaking out.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.798
You don't know
because you won't let me try.

26:05.832 --> 26:08.668
Dr. Walker, if Lauren
were performing

26:08.701 --> 26:11.237
and you were able to stop her
before she had too many spikes,

26:11.270 --> 26:14.674
like you did just now,
would she still be OK?

26:14.707 --> 26:17.844
Yes. But I can't attach all this
monitoring equipment to her

26:17.877 --> 26:21.013
while she's flipping
on a four inch beam.

26:21.047 --> 26:23.315
That's the only way
we know if she's gonna be OK.

26:23.349 --> 26:26.853
Right, but nowadays there are
all kinds of things

26:26.886 --> 26:28.554
that work without wires.

26:28.587 --> 26:29.889
That's true. My phone, a remote,

26:29.922 --> 26:31.924
there's tons of
wireless devices.

26:31.958 --> 26:33.325
What if you could
monitor me that way

26:33.359 --> 26:35.795
without me being tied
to all this stuff?

26:35.828 --> 26:37.096
Could she perform then?

26:42.769 --> 26:44.637
Pay.

26:44.671 --> 26:47.306
You are not a workhorse,

26:47.339 --> 26:49.308
or a sacrificial lamb,

26:49.341 --> 26:51.878
and you're definitely not
the safe girl.

26:55.247 --> 26:56.816
Look up there.

26:59.719 --> 27:01.721
My girl is light.

27:03.389 --> 27:05.057
And the way I see it...

27:07.026 --> 27:09.028
...you're the brightest light
of them all.

27:10.830 --> 27:13.766
How is it possible
that you always know

27:13.800 --> 27:16.002
exactly what to say
to make me feel better?

27:16.035 --> 27:19.972
Well, that's because...

27:20.006 --> 27:21.741
[both laughing]

27:26.746 --> 27:28.047
...I love you.

27:29.782 --> 27:30.917
I love you, too.

27:34.120 --> 27:36.856
[dance music playing]

27:41.761 --> 27:43.696
[both laughing]

28:03.716 --> 28:04.717
Ooh!

28:34.480 --> 28:36.916
Ah... Payson?

28:36.949 --> 28:38.951
What? Oh, my God,
was my dancing stupid?

28:38.985 --> 28:40.853
I'm so sorry,
I just got into it.

28:40.887 --> 28:42.789
Payson, Payson,
you look amazing!

28:42.822 --> 28:44.356
That right there,
the way you were moving,

28:44.390 --> 28:46.692
that's what you should do
in your floor routine.

28:46.725 --> 28:51.330
They think your safe?
Go prove them wrong.

29:04.043 --> 29:06.412
[Dr. Walker] This is
a wireless reading device.

29:06.445 --> 29:09.281
OK, Lauren, go ahead

29:09.315 --> 29:11.317
and do a few
jumping jacks for me.

29:12.484 --> 29:13.485
[exhales]

29:15.321 --> 29:19.091
As long as Lauren's heart stays
within this range, she's fine.

29:19.125 --> 29:21.127
[beeping]

29:25.798 --> 29:27.366
[beeping increasing]

29:35.307 --> 29:36.275
[digital chirping]

29:36.308 --> 29:37.776
OK, Lauren, you can stop now.

29:37.810 --> 29:41.180
What... What was that?
What just happened?

29:41.213 --> 29:43.315
That's the abnormal spike
we've been monitoring all week.

29:43.349 --> 29:45.217
[Steve] Right, but is she OK?

29:45.251 --> 29:46.785
Daddy, please, I'm fine.

29:46.819 --> 29:49.188
One spike won't harm her,
two, three, four.

29:49.221 --> 29:51.523
But five in a row
gets her into risky territory.

29:51.557 --> 29:54.093
What kind of risky territory?

29:54.126 --> 29:55.862
Five consecutive spikes
will cause her

29:55.895 --> 29:57.296
to start experiencing symptoms

29:57.329 --> 29:59.899
and possibly be in
danger of fainting.

29:59.932 --> 30:02.001
No, no, no, no.
Look, I...

30:02.034 --> 30:04.370
I didn't realize that there was
still that kind of risk.

30:04.403 --> 30:07.339
Lauren, I can't allow this.

30:07.373 --> 30:08.474
That's the point of
the wireless device.

30:08.507 --> 30:11.110
It will enable us
to minimize the danger.

30:11.143 --> 30:13.846
Dad, I'm at risk every time
I get up on that beam

30:13.880 --> 30:15.514
whether I have a heart
condition or not.

30:15.547 --> 30:17.549
This is my one
and only chance.

30:19.852 --> 30:20.853
Coach?

30:23.422 --> 30:27.426
She deserves this chance, Steve.
You gotta let her try.

30:29.428 --> 30:33.465
OK. I don't like this,
but OK.

30:37.336 --> 30:40.172
All right then, all we
have to do now is decide

30:40.206 --> 30:41.908
who will be
monitoring Lauren.

30:41.941 --> 30:44.343
I won't be here
and I realize it's a
tremendous responsibility...

30:44.376 --> 30:46.212
I'll do it. Uh...

30:46.245 --> 30:47.513
I've worked with
these types of machines

30:47.546 --> 30:50.950
and I'm used to monitoring
these girls for all types of
reasons.

30:50.983 --> 30:53.419
I'd be honored to do it.

30:53.452 --> 30:54.553
Then let's get started.

30:54.586 --> 30:57.056
Lauren, you ready
to give this a try?

30:57.089 --> 31:01.427
- It's now or never,
so, yeah, I'm ready.
- OK.

31:10.469 --> 31:12.871
[beeping]

31:23.415 --> 31:24.883
[chiming]

31:32.925 --> 31:35.094
- Should we stop her?
- She's still fine.

31:47.506 --> 31:49.108
Stop.

31:51.177 --> 31:54.246
Uh, I got caught up in
what I was doing, I'm sorry.

31:54.280 --> 31:55.647
Don't be sorry, you did great.

31:55.681 --> 31:58.184
In fact, you worked your heart
much more today

31:58.217 --> 31:59.185
than you did yesterday.

31:59.218 --> 32:01.320
Based on what just happened,

32:01.353 --> 32:03.655
when is it safe for her
to come back and train?

32:03.689 --> 32:06.058
Another two days
should do the trick.

32:06.092 --> 32:07.359
I can't say for certain.

32:07.393 --> 32:10.429
We'll reassess then the
possibility of you competing.

32:36.122 --> 32:38.257
Thanks.

32:38.290 --> 32:40.592
It's just another two days.
That's 48 hours,

32:40.626 --> 32:44.196
- you can do this.
- It's not that.

32:44.230 --> 32:46.632
When Dr. Walker told me to stop,

32:46.665 --> 32:48.267
it was the first time ever

32:48.300 --> 32:51.337
in my entire gymnastics life
that I felt...

32:53.072 --> 32:55.041
...afraid.

32:57.509 --> 32:59.645
Just, that beam,
it's been a part of me,

32:59.678 --> 33:01.713
it's been like another arm
or another leg,

33:01.747 --> 33:05.117
and today, it felt
outside of me.

33:05.151 --> 33:06.518
I know what you're
going through.

33:06.552 --> 33:09.355
You just... you have
to make it a part of you again.

33:09.388 --> 33:13.559
[sobbing] I can't train. How am
I supposed to overcome this?

33:13.592 --> 33:14.593
With your mind.

33:16.095 --> 33:18.097
So much of our success out there

33:18.130 --> 33:20.232
has to do with
how we perform mentally.

33:20.266 --> 33:22.134
You have to use your mind
to train,

33:22.168 --> 33:24.303
go over your whole routine,
piece by piece,

33:24.336 --> 33:26.405
exactly like if
you were performing it.

33:26.438 --> 33:28.440
That's what I did
when I broke my back.

33:30.576 --> 33:31.610
Did it work?

33:31.643 --> 33:34.113
I'm here, aren't I?

33:36.115 --> 33:38.717
Just trust that your physical
muscle memory,

33:38.750 --> 33:41.387
it'll know what to do
and it'll just do it.

33:42.488 --> 33:47.426
Hey, Lauren. You are
Queen of the Beam.

33:47.459 --> 33:50.262
You are irreplaceable,
the best I have ever seen

33:50.296 --> 33:52.531
and you cannot forget that.

33:52.564 --> 33:56.402
Hey guys! How'd your
test-thingy go, Lauren?

33:56.435 --> 33:58.036
Fine.

33:58.070 --> 33:59.738
Well, if you need any help
getting back up to speed,

33:59.771 --> 34:01.773
just let me know.

34:01.807 --> 34:04.576
Coach Ray said I was
Princess of the Beam.

34:04.610 --> 34:07.279
- Isn't that great?
- Yeah, just peachy.

34:13.252 --> 34:16.355
Looks like Queen of the Beam
just got overthrown.

34:22.661 --> 34:24.530
You missed our
training session again.

34:26.632 --> 34:28.334
- Your shoulder OK?
- It's fine.

34:28.367 --> 34:31.170
- You should move this bag...
- I said it's fine.

34:35.607 --> 34:39.077
Jordan, I know what's going on.

34:40.312 --> 34:44.250
I understand, I do.
You're mad at me.

34:44.283 --> 34:46.485
You see me working with
the other girls and you're
hurt by it.

34:46.518 --> 34:51.690
You're jealous because you think
that I've given up on you.

34:51.723 --> 34:54.760
- Whatever.
- No.

34:54.793 --> 34:57.196
Jordan, it's not "whatever."

34:57.229 --> 34:59.831
Look, you and I had
a very special bond,

34:59.865 --> 35:02.301
but I just couldn't be
your private coach anymore.

35:02.334 --> 35:04.236
It wasn't fair.

35:04.270 --> 35:07.206
You know that.
We had to move on.

35:10.709 --> 35:15.113
I did everything I could
to help you be the best.

35:15.147 --> 35:19.785
And by the looks of things,
I did a pretty good job.

35:21.587 --> 35:22.721
I never abandoned you.

35:24.790 --> 35:28.227
And I never, ever stopped
believing in you.

35:53.552 --> 35:56.522
Deep breath in
through your nose...

35:56.555 --> 36:00.158
...hold it and now exhale
through your mouth.

36:00.192 --> 36:01.427
[both exhaling]

36:01.460 --> 36:05.897
OK, now I want you
to repeat after me.

36:05.931 --> 36:09.535
- I, Lauren...
- I, Lauren...

36:09.568 --> 36:12.838
...am going to embrace
the power of my mind...

36:14.573 --> 36:16.508
Just say it.

36:16.542 --> 36:19.611
Am going to embrace
the power of my mind.

36:19.645 --> 36:22.514
Now, I want you to visualize
what I'm saying,

36:22.548 --> 36:24.283
but not the big picture,

36:24.316 --> 36:27.286
the things that make
what you do unique.

36:27.319 --> 36:32.524
The elements of your
routine that are one hundred
percent Lauren Tanner. OK?

36:37.529 --> 36:39.465
You approach the beam.

36:42.368 --> 36:44.970
You start your routine
with a killer mount.

36:48.874 --> 36:51.477
Next, you move into
a flashy aerial series.

36:55.847 --> 36:59.351
Now you slither to
some really hot salsa moves.

37:00.552 --> 37:02.354
Now some pivot turns...

37:04.456 --> 37:05.891
...into a leap series.

37:10.929 --> 37:14.533
Now, go stick that
double full dismount.

37:16.402 --> 37:17.436
Deep breath.

37:21.773 --> 37:23.642
Push past the fear, Tanner.

37:23.675 --> 37:27.913
Because behind it, you'll find
your courage. I promise.

37:37.523 --> 37:39.358
I did it!
[laughs]

37:39.391 --> 37:40.559
I know you did.

37:40.592 --> 37:43.329
Now keep that belief in yourself
and you'll be unstoppable.

37:43.362 --> 37:45.564
How did you know
my entire routine?

37:45.597 --> 37:48.467
You're always making fun of me
and calling them flippity-flips.

37:48.500 --> 37:53.372
Come on, Tanner. When you
admire someone, you want to
know everything they do.

37:53.405 --> 37:54.873
- [chuckles]
- [Payson] I'm sorry,

37:54.906 --> 37:56.442
am I interrupting something?

37:56.475 --> 37:58.910
I was just getting
some training in.

37:58.944 --> 38:02.581
You two have fun doing your
little flippity-flips.

38:06.352 --> 38:08.720
- [door opens, closes]
- Training?

38:08.754 --> 38:10.456
[laughing]

38:10.489 --> 38:13.759
I took your advice,
use my mind.

38:13.792 --> 38:15.394
How'd it feel?

38:15.427 --> 38:17.429
Perfect.

38:19.765 --> 38:21.299
Are you ready?
You all set?

38:21.333 --> 38:23.769
Yeah, you know, maybe we could
just scrap this whole thing,

38:23.802 --> 38:27.439
I really appreciate you being
so willing to help me, but...

38:27.473 --> 38:29.941
I can't hear you. Mm-mm.

38:29.975 --> 38:32.911
OK, I'm terrified.

38:32.944 --> 38:34.480
[exhales]

38:34.513 --> 38:36.047
Push past that fear, Payson.

38:36.081 --> 38:40.686
Because behind it,
you'll find your courage.

38:40.719 --> 38:43.655
Now come on, let's get some
sizzle up in here!

38:43.689 --> 38:45.557
- Woo!
- God.

38:45.591 --> 38:47.726
- [Lauren laughs]
- [upbeat dance music]

38:49.060 --> 38:51.663
All right, let's see
what you're made of.

39:02.608 --> 39:04.042
Hey, you want some tea?

39:05.744 --> 39:07.345
Are you OK?

39:08.480 --> 39:10.449
All right.

39:11.550 --> 39:13.485
Look, I know something's
up with you

39:13.519 --> 39:14.586
and I don't want to
cross any lines,

39:14.620 --> 39:17.523
but if you want
to talk, I'm here.

39:22.894 --> 39:25.564
Hi, roomies! Hope you weren't
waiting up for me.

39:25.597 --> 39:27.699
It's late. Where were you?

39:27.733 --> 39:29.568
Coach Ray offered
to help me some more.

39:29.601 --> 39:31.570
He is just so terrific!

39:31.603 --> 39:34.973
We got a bite to eat and watched
some Olympic training videos
back at his place.

39:35.006 --> 39:39.377
He thinks I'm the
next Shawn Johnson. [giggles]

39:39.411 --> 39:41.980
What do you think you're doing?

39:42.013 --> 39:44.483
Gosh, Jordan, calm down.

39:44.516 --> 39:47.586
I'm sorry you're so jealous that
Coach Ray is helping me now.

39:47.619 --> 39:49.655
He told me you might be mad.

40:06.772 --> 40:08.440
What room is Ray Keegan in?

40:08.474 --> 40:10.141
- What is this in regards to?
- Jordan, let's just leave.

40:10.175 --> 40:11.643
What room is he in?

40:11.677 --> 40:13.912
It's against our policy
to give out room numbers.

40:13.945 --> 40:15.814
Besides, Coach Keegan
is in a meeting,

40:15.847 --> 40:17.415
you can leave a message
if you'd like.

40:17.449 --> 40:18.450
I'm sorry.

40:20.786 --> 40:22.588
[door opens]

40:22.621 --> 40:25.691
[Kaylie] Jordan, stop. Stop!

40:25.724 --> 40:27.693
- What is going on?
- Get away from me!
Go back to the dorm, Kaylie!

40:27.726 --> 40:29.561
No. I am not gonna leave you
like this.

40:29.595 --> 40:31.997
I can't watch you throw
away your entire career

40:32.030 --> 40:34.633
over some stupid jealousy
about Wendy.

40:34.666 --> 40:38.136
That's what you think this is?
You think I'm jealous?

40:38.169 --> 40:39.638
I'm sorry, I just...

40:39.671 --> 40:42.474
...you've always been
a little possessive.

40:42.508 --> 40:44.409
Forget it, leave me alone.

40:44.442 --> 40:47.546
Jordan, what...
What are you doing?

40:50.148 --> 40:51.950
Jordan, what are you doing?

40:51.983 --> 40:53.218
Jordan, no!

40:54.620 --> 40:56.488
- No, that's Coach Ray's car!
- [grunts]

40:56.522 --> 40:58.590
Stop! Why are you
doing this?

40:58.624 --> 41:01.493
Please, Jordan,
don't do this!

41:02.728 --> 41:04.596
Stop it!
Jordan!

41:04.630 --> 41:06.965
- Don't, Jordan, stop!
- [grunting]

41:08.466 --> 41:09.668
Stop, please!

41:09.701 --> 41:13.004
No, I can't, I can't!
I can't!

41:13.038 --> 41:15.140
[sobbing]

41:15.173 --> 41:17.509
I can't, I can't!

41:22.981 --> 41:25.751
Hey. Hey, it's OK.

41:25.784 --> 41:28.754
Hey, I'm right here.

41:28.787 --> 41:30.689
- I'm right here.
- No. No, I can't.

41:30.722 --> 41:35.226
I can't let him touch Wendy
the way he touched me.

41:35.260 --> 41:36.862
What? What?

41:36.895 --> 41:38.664
What are you saying?
What do you mean?

41:38.697 --> 41:40.966
[sniffs] Ray...

41:43.101 --> 41:47.706
He molested me.
For years, he molested me.

41:48.707 --> 41:51.142
Oh, God, Jordan.
Jordan...

41:52.944 --> 41:55.881
He convinced me
that it was me who wanted it,

41:55.914 --> 41:58.483
that it was me
who asked for it.

41:58.516 --> 42:01.553
All those times back at camp
that I didn't include you

42:01.587 --> 42:02.754
was to protect you.

42:02.788 --> 42:05.724
I couldn't let him hurt you.

42:05.757 --> 42:11.162
I'm so sorry, I didn't know.
I swear I didn't know.

42:11.196 --> 42:12.297
He...

42:13.699 --> 42:16.835
He said I wouldn't be
any good without him.

42:16.868 --> 42:21.006
He said... He said that
if I told anyone

42:21.039 --> 42:24.542
that he would find a way
to ban me from gymnastics.

42:24.576 --> 42:27.913
And that's all I had.

42:27.946 --> 42:29.681
That's all I had!

42:29.715 --> 42:34.252
Without gymnastics, I would be
nothing, I wouldn't even exist.

42:38.690 --> 42:40.291
So I just let it happen.

42:40.325 --> 42:42.861
No. Hey.

42:42.894 --> 42:44.830
No, you didn't.

42:44.863 --> 42:49.234
OK? You can not
blame yourself.

42:49.267 --> 42:52.137
God, you were just a kid

42:52.170 --> 42:54.906
and he abused you.

42:54.940 --> 42:56.908
But you are a survivor.

42:56.942 --> 43:01.246
Listen to me,
that is what you are.

43:01.279 --> 43:05.083
And we can tell somebody now,
we can get help.

43:05.116 --> 43:08.620
It'll be his word against mine.
No one will believe me.

43:08.654 --> 43:13.324
I believe you.
And I will stand by you.

43:14.860 --> 43:16.327
- I promise.
- [sirens approaching]

43:16.361 --> 43:17.929
No.

43:19.297 --> 43:21.232
Come on, we gotta
get out of here.

43:21.266 --> 43:22.834
Let's go, come on.
