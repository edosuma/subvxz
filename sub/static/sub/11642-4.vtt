00:02.504 --> 00:04.506
Announcer:

00:13.223 --> 00:15.642
Your name is Toby.
Now tell me your name.

00:15.725 --> 00:18.186
- Kunta Kinte.
- That's not your name!

00:18.269 --> 00:19.688
[screams]

00:19.771 --> 00:22.399
And I will name you Kizzy.

00:22.482 --> 00:26.027
I think I was selfish to have you born
into a world like this.

00:26.111 --> 00:27.862
You trained me well.

00:27.946 --> 00:29.864
Belle: Kizzy!

00:29.948 --> 00:31.241
[crying]

00:31.324 --> 00:33.201
Kizzy!

00:33.284 --> 00:35.870
- This is my right!
- Kill me!

00:35.954 --> 00:37.706
I'm gonna name you
after my Daddy...

00:37.789 --> 00:39.708
George Lea II.

00:39.791 --> 00:41.251
[crowd chanting
"Chicken George"]

00:41.334 --> 00:43.169
George: Come on.
What you got, boy?

00:45.130 --> 00:47.882
I got to know a time gonna come
when I can buy me free.

00:47.966 --> 00:50.218
I don't see why not, George.

00:50.301 --> 00:52.846
And I'm gonna see you again,
my mourning dove.

00:52.929 --> 00:54.889
[all cheering]

00:54.973 --> 00:56.933
Your name is who you is.

00:57.058 --> 01:00.437
My Daddy took whippings
to protect his name.

01:00.520 --> 01:02.355
You get to making babies.

01:02.439 --> 01:04.941
Tom would be a fine name
for a boy.

01:05.066 --> 01:06.651
Just bring yourself home safe.

01:09.237 --> 01:12.532
You win this for me,
and I'll set you free.

01:12.615 --> 01:14.701
I swear.

01:14.784 --> 01:17.162
- [roosters clucking]
- Fight announcer: That does it!

01:20.081 --> 01:22.059
That Englishman will call me
even if I give you to him...

01:22.083 --> 01:23.626
- take back to England.
- England?!

01:23.710 --> 01:25.336
Get this nigger off of me!

01:25.420 --> 01:26.963
Who gonna watch my family?!

01:27.088 --> 01:28.673
Tom Lea!
[grunts]

01:29.716 --> 01:32.093
[pants, screams]

01:57.494 --> 01:59.287
Man #1:
£100 on the red.

01:59.370 --> 02:00.830
Man #2:
£200 on the white.

02:00.914 --> 02:02.540
Man #3:
£500 on the white.

02:02.624 --> 02:04.542
Man #4: Yeah, yeah,
I can take some bets.

02:04.626 --> 02:09.839
Alex: Mandinka say, "Everything
that enchants also deceives."

02:09.923 --> 02:11.633
I'm not sure
which is more exotic...

02:11.716 --> 02:13.259
your bird or your nigger.

02:13.343 --> 02:15.386
Now, would another £10,000
clarify the issue?

02:15.470 --> 02:16.805
[chickens clucking]

02:16.888 --> 02:18.389
Done.

02:18.473 --> 02:20.266
Excellent.

02:20.350 --> 02:22.352
[indistinct conversations]

02:23.561 --> 02:26.648
All right, there he is.

02:26.731 --> 02:30.610
We're stronger, faster,
smarter, prettier.

02:30.693 --> 02:33.655
Insult to be in the same pit
with you and me.

02:33.738 --> 02:35.782
Now, what you gonna do
about it?

02:35.865 --> 02:38.451
[rooster clucking]

02:38.535 --> 02:40.954
- [laughter]
- Whoo!

02:41.037 --> 02:46.626
Ladies and gentlemen, America
is a wild and dangerous land.

02:46.709 --> 02:49.212
One time,
I saw a Carolina bobcat

02:49.295 --> 02:51.297
drag a man
high up a hickory tree,

02:51.381 --> 02:54.217
and two minutes later,
his skeleton fell back down.

02:54.300 --> 02:55.621
- [laughter]
- Flesh picked clean.

02:55.635 --> 02:57.262
Just raining bones.
Clickety-clack.

02:57.345 --> 02:59.025
I've been chased by savages,
painted faces.

02:59.097 --> 03:01.891
Alex: After he was sent off
to settle a gambling debt,

03:01.975 --> 03:04.686
Chicken George won
nearly every match.

03:04.769 --> 03:06.771
The English loved him,

03:06.855 --> 03:10.942
and he fell into his old ways,
playing to the crowd.

03:11.025 --> 03:15.154
Let me tell you now, I have wrestled
mountain men big as bears.

03:15.238 --> 03:18.199
They all naked. They men parts
covered only by their beards.

03:18.283 --> 03:20.618
- [laughter]
- Chicken George!

03:20.702 --> 03:23.580
All: Chicken George!

03:23.663 --> 03:25.456
You've served me well, George.

03:25.540 --> 03:26.958
And I want to assure you,

03:27.041 --> 03:29.210
when I've earned back the money
Tom Lea lost to me,

03:29.294 --> 03:30.962
I will send you home a free man.

03:31.045 --> 03:35.091
Just wanted to know, sir.
When would that be?

03:35.216 --> 03:38.428
- Sir, how much longer I got...
- I will tell you when the time is right.

03:40.555 --> 03:43.099
Alex: By the time
Sir Eric set him free,

03:43.224 --> 03:46.227
George had been in England
for over 20 years...

03:46.311 --> 03:49.814
no longer enchanted,
no longer deceived.

03:54.152 --> 03:57.363
- Man: Stand at the gate.
- [baby crying]

03:59.574 --> 04:04.120
Traveling homeward, George felt
the past surge around him.

04:04.245 --> 04:09.125
He remembered how Kizzy said
Kunta Kinte came to visit her,

04:09.250 --> 04:12.962
but George was afraid that his vision
would mean something different...

04:13.046 --> 04:17.675
that his seven children would think of him
as little more than another story.

04:17.759 --> 04:22.639
Or worse, that they had
forgotten him altogether.

04:24.974 --> 04:26.976
[woman singing indistinctly]

04:38.404 --> 04:40.657
[singing continues]

04:42.951 --> 04:44.911
Did you fall?

04:44.994 --> 04:48.790
I just sit away from the trees,
feel the light on my face.

04:48.873 --> 04:52.210
- [resumes singing]
- Miss Malizy?

04:52.293 --> 04:54.128
It's George.

04:54.212 --> 04:55.588
- George?
- Chicken George.

04:55.672 --> 04:57.048
I'm back from England.

04:57.131 --> 05:00.009
George?

05:00.093 --> 05:02.345
Come on now.
Let's get you up.

05:04.639 --> 05:06.641
[Malizy humming]

05:16.067 --> 05:18.069
[boards creaking]

05:27.704 --> 05:31.332
Where is my family?

05:31.416 --> 05:33.751
I know where your mama is.

05:40.675 --> 05:45.179
Kizzy got a pain in her side.
She knew she was dying.

05:45.263 --> 05:47.473
Mama.

05:47.557 --> 05:49.559
[breathing shakily]

05:51.352 --> 05:53.396
I'm sorry.

05:56.482 --> 05:58.109
Mama...

06:00.361 --> 06:02.780
[shuddering]

06:07.869 --> 06:09.579
[sniffles]

06:12.415 --> 06:15.501
Miss Malizy,
I'm gonna look around.

06:15.585 --> 06:17.146
Then I'll gonna come back
and take you with me.

06:17.170 --> 06:18.880
Oh, no, sir.
No. No.

06:18.963 --> 06:21.549
I got a right to be here.

06:21.632 --> 06:26.471
I worked this ground
every day of my life.

06:26.554 --> 06:30.266
I got a right
to be buried by Kizzy.

06:31.601 --> 06:33.770
Miss Malizy, I got to go look
for my family.

06:33.853 --> 06:36.064
You ask Master Tom?

06:37.648 --> 06:41.694
- Tom Lea's still alive?
- Mm-hmm.

06:41.778 --> 06:43.780
[door creaks]

06:44.906 --> 06:46.908
[birds chirping]

06:53.456 --> 06:55.458
[chickens squawking]

07:03.508 --> 07:04.759
[gunshot]

07:04.842 --> 07:06.094
[gun cocks]

07:07.637 --> 07:11.307
I'll shoot you, nigger,
right here.

07:11.432 --> 07:15.061
Let my chickens peck
at your cold, black body.

07:15.144 --> 07:17.522
I know you're here to rob me.

07:17.605 --> 07:20.191
But I reckon
I could kill you first.

07:20.274 --> 07:23.694
Kill your own baby boy,
Massa Tom?

07:23.778 --> 07:27.323
I know you?

07:27.448 --> 07:30.076
Sure you do.

07:30.159 --> 07:31.911
- [gasps]
- All right.

07:33.121 --> 07:35.414
George?

07:35.498 --> 07:37.583
My George?

07:40.545 --> 07:44.090
You come back for me, George.

07:46.968 --> 07:48.970
[sobbing]

07:52.014 --> 07:54.016
[insects buzzing]

07:55.268 --> 08:00.022
You say his name Benjamin Murray,
Alamance County?

08:00.106 --> 08:02.483
Murray.
Benjamin Murray.

08:02.567 --> 08:04.861
That's who bought my children?

08:04.944 --> 08:07.738
He an engineer at
the Fayetteville arsenal.

08:07.822 --> 08:10.283
That right?

08:10.366 --> 08:13.327
Needed the money, George.

08:13.411 --> 08:17.039
- How could you leave me?
- Oh, I didn't leave you.

08:17.123 --> 08:21.210
You sold me to pay
a gambling debt,

08:21.294 --> 08:24.839
just like you sold my children.

08:24.922 --> 08:28.050
- I taught you everything.
- It's all right.

08:28.134 --> 08:31.262
Got you a life
with fancy folk in England.

08:31.345 --> 08:33.514
What did I get?

08:34.515 --> 08:38.186
Patricia run off.
Whore.

08:39.187 --> 08:41.772
Old niggers can hardly work.

08:41.856 --> 08:44.232
[scoffs]

08:44.317 --> 08:47.528
Who's gonna look after me,
George?

08:47.612 --> 08:50.907
Who's gonna cook and clean?

08:50.990 --> 08:52.867
Who's gonna obey me?

08:52.950 --> 08:56.537
You said you'd leave
papers for my family,

08:56.621 --> 08:59.832
so they free.

08:59.916 --> 09:03.669
You swore that to me
as they was dragging me away!

09:03.753 --> 09:06.380
Said you'd set my wife
and all my children free.

09:06.464 --> 09:08.883
So did you write
them papers for my family?

09:08.966 --> 09:10.343
Where are they?

09:10.426 --> 09:12.136
[panting]

09:12.220 --> 09:15.389
You a man without honor,
Tom Lea.

09:15.473 --> 09:18.476
You walked your feet
out them dirt hills.

09:18.559 --> 09:20.561
But not your filthy soul.

09:20.645 --> 09:23.648
You and me have
the same blood, boy.

09:23.731 --> 09:25.983
I'm your Daddy.

09:26.067 --> 09:28.361
No, the blood in me
from Kizzy, not you...

09:28.444 --> 09:31.072
blood that kept me strong
all these years away.

09:31.155 --> 09:34.158
What few good things I done,
that the blood of my granddaddy.

09:34.242 --> 09:39.330
And every damn bit of foolishness in me,
everything weak, everything selfish?

09:39.413 --> 09:43.751
That's you, Tom Lea,
'cause that's who you is.

09:43.834 --> 09:46.045
You ain't smart enough
to change yourself.

09:48.381 --> 09:50.967
And the truth is,
your whole damn life...

09:52.593 --> 09:55.680
...you was a slave, too.

09:55.763 --> 09:57.598
You just never knew it.

10:07.775 --> 10:10.695
God damn you.

10:12.613 --> 10:14.156
Tom?

10:14.240 --> 10:16.993
Tom!

10:17.076 --> 10:18.869
Oh, Tom!

10:18.953 --> 10:20.806
Mama, what you doing out here?
You got to get to work.

10:20.830 --> 10:22.683
I need you to stop at the Barton farm
on your way back,

10:22.707 --> 10:24.041
see Old Man Augustus.

10:24.125 --> 10:26.165
He... he sells that special
chestnut tea for asthma.

10:26.210 --> 10:27.670
Mama, I'm not passing that way.

10:27.753 --> 10:30.464
Besides, Massa Murray knows
how many stops I make.

10:30.548 --> 10:32.425
Son.

10:32.508 --> 10:36.095
I'll work fast, mama.
Bring some back for you.

10:36.178 --> 10:37.847
Hey, now you got
to get to work.

10:37.930 --> 10:41.267
You got a big heart,
like your Daddy.

10:41.350 --> 10:43.436
I ain't like my Daddy.

10:43.519 --> 10:46.230
I'll never do nothing foolish
to make Massa Murray angry,

10:46.314 --> 10:48.149
get myself sold away.

10:53.070 --> 10:54.989
You just get home safe.

10:55.072 --> 10:56.615
It only takes
one crazy redneck,

10:56.699 --> 10:58.659
and Massa's road papers
don't mean nothing.

10:58.743 --> 11:01.787
Just look after Irene
and that baby in her belly.

11:01.871 --> 11:03.706
Now, get going now.

11:03.789 --> 11:06.042
[clicks tongue] Hyah!

11:06.125 --> 11:08.127
[metal clanking]

11:09.879 --> 11:12.214
Business used
to come to me in bunches.

11:12.298 --> 11:15.217
Now with all this war talk,
can't keep my shop open.

11:15.301 --> 11:18.054
It ain't safe to be a colored free man
in Carolina no more.

11:18.137 --> 11:20.181
Ain't never been safe
to be a slave.

11:20.264 --> 11:22.767
Mm-hmm.

11:22.850 --> 11:26.103
I hear Mr. Murray send a fine blacksmith
like you all over the state, Tom.

11:26.187 --> 11:28.689
- He pay you a little?
- I need to finish up with you, man.

11:30.775 --> 11:32.234
Come on out here, boy.

11:32.318 --> 11:34.070
[door creaks]

11:37.198 --> 11:39.492
This boy a runaway.
Stay up here mostly.

11:39.575 --> 11:41.869
I tell folks he's my slave.

11:41.952 --> 11:43.287
Some freemen keep niggers, too.

11:43.371 --> 11:46.582
- How long you been hiding?
- August be seven whole years.

11:48.167 --> 11:49.710
Seven years?

11:49.877 --> 11:52.296
My brother and me ran away
from Chatham County.

11:52.380 --> 11:54.465
He got caught,
but they didn't see me.

11:54.548 --> 11:56.592
I hid in the bushes.

11:56.717 --> 11:58.552
Saw them patrol boys hang him.

11:58.636 --> 12:00.096
[sighs]

12:00.179 --> 12:02.431
When I passed by here,
Orly let me hide.

12:02.515 --> 12:05.559
I'm leaving the state soon
and this boy ain't got no papers, Tom.

12:05.643 --> 12:07.353
You got a pass
lets you go anywhere.

12:07.436 --> 12:10.147
Name's Winslow.

12:10.231 --> 12:13.734
Just get me by the docks
at Elizabeth City.

12:13.818 --> 12:15.820
Gonna sneak
on a barge going north.

12:17.613 --> 12:19.323
Can't help.

12:19.407 --> 12:21.992
Massa Murray knows how long
it takes me to make my rounds.

12:22.076 --> 12:23.828
Got a clock for a heart.

12:23.911 --> 12:27.331
Besides, I need to earn money
for my family, buy them free.

12:27.415 --> 12:29.708
Can't I be free?

12:35.756 --> 12:37.341
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:46.350 --> 12:49.186
What's this place?

12:49.270 --> 12:51.522
Crossing into Duplin County.

12:51.605 --> 12:53.190
[horse neighs]

12:53.274 --> 12:55.776
Come on, now.

12:57.194 --> 12:59.955
You got no papers and I ain't got
no way to prove you working with me.

12:59.989 --> 13:02.241
So best take off now.

13:02.324 --> 13:04.410
Can't just leave me out here.

13:04.493 --> 13:06.704
You lucky I took you this far!

13:06.787 --> 13:08.289
[horse neighs]

13:08.372 --> 13:12.460
And if they catch you, you better not tell
nobody my name, understand?

13:12.543 --> 13:13.919
Come on.

13:15.838 --> 13:18.549
Get in them trees now!

13:18.632 --> 13:20.509
Hyah, hyah!

13:35.816 --> 13:37.443
That's far enough!

13:38.819 --> 13:40.446
Just stop there!

13:40.529 --> 13:43.240
- If I can just explain.
- That's far enough.

13:43.324 --> 13:45.326
I see that pistol
in your waist.

13:45.409 --> 13:49.371
You put it down, or I'll swear
I'll take it from your dead body.

13:49.455 --> 13:52.041
Toomey, what's all the fuss?

13:52.124 --> 13:54.668
Nigger has a gun.

13:57.087 --> 13:59.381
I got a reason to be here.

13:59.465 --> 14:00.883
If I can just speak
to Mr. Murray.

14:00.966 --> 14:03.135
I'm his son.

14:03.219 --> 14:04.512
First, you need to prove to me

14:04.595 --> 14:07.348
you ain't here to cause trouble
with our niggers.

14:07.431 --> 14:09.016
Who is it, Frederick?

14:09.099 --> 14:10.518
We got a smart-mouth nigger.

14:10.601 --> 14:13.854
Came strolling on the farm
in his fancy clothes,

14:13.938 --> 14:16.690
like he's paying a social call.

14:16.774 --> 14:18.859
Got a fancy gun, too.

14:20.986 --> 14:26.867
For all I know, he's here
to provoke an insurrection.

14:30.663 --> 14:31.973
Virgil: Hey, you know that old boy?

14:31.997 --> 14:35.918
Uh-uh. But he remind me
of a man about to die.

14:36.001 --> 14:39.004
Benjamin, is there trouble?

14:39.088 --> 14:40.607
Oh, it's nothing to concern
yourself with, Charlotte.

14:40.631 --> 14:42.758
- [coughs]
- Matilda, take my wife inside.

14:43.884 --> 14:45.302
- [coughs]
- Come inside.

14:45.386 --> 14:47.187
Matilda: You need some nice,
hot steam, ma'am.

14:47.263 --> 14:48.764
Mourning dove!

14:54.186 --> 14:55.563
George?

14:58.232 --> 15:00.693
Frederick:
Tilda, you know this boy?

15:00.776 --> 15:03.279
That's my George, my husband.

15:05.197 --> 15:06.657
- [gun cocks]
- Take another step,

15:06.740 --> 15:07.992
I'll shoot you right here.

15:08.075 --> 15:11.662
Then you will kill Matilda's husband
and a free man.

15:11.745 --> 15:15.833
Check my pocket.
You'll see my paper.

15:22.548 --> 15:26.844
I was manumitted by Sir C.E. Russell
of Hampshire, England.

15:26.927 --> 15:30.055
That's his family seal.

15:30.139 --> 15:32.099
This is a free nigger.

15:32.182 --> 15:36.312
So return his property
and obey the law.

15:36.395 --> 15:38.397
Thank you, sir.

15:42.484 --> 15:45.237
There's your fancy gun, nigger.

15:47.406 --> 15:51.076
Tilda, if this man
is your husband,

15:51.160 --> 15:54.705
you will see him
after the workday is done.

15:54.788 --> 15:57.166
Until then,

15:57.249 --> 16:00.753
I will allow him
to wait on the road.

16:02.254 --> 16:05.674
We've been parted
a long time, Tilda.

16:05.758 --> 16:09.178
Few more hours
ain't no bother to us.

16:18.896 --> 16:23.984
# Soon I will be done #

16:25.444 --> 16:28.113
- # Trouble of the world #
- Man: I want to see a lot less talk

16:28.197 --> 16:31.158
and a hell of a lot more work!

# Trouble of the world #

16:37.456 --> 16:43.087
# Trouble of the world #

16:43.170 --> 16:48.133

16:49.134 --> 16:53.847

16:53.931 --> 16:55.182
[horn blares]

16:55.265 --> 16:58.310

16:58.394 --> 17:01.480

17:01.563 --> 17:07.027

17:37.808 --> 17:43.814
[vocalizing]

17:49.194 --> 17:51.488
Matilda: All this work, George...

17:51.572 --> 17:54.950
Am I still pretty?

17:55.075 --> 17:58.495
I dreamed of you so many years.

17:58.579 --> 18:00.831
My dreams failed me.

18:00.914 --> 18:02.416
[sighs]

18:02.499 --> 18:04.793
You are so much more beautiful

18:04.877 --> 18:08.088
than I could possibly
bring to mind.

18:08.172 --> 18:10.674
Now let me watch you
bein' my wife.

18:10.758 --> 18:12.551
[laughs]

18:12.634 --> 18:14.303
Unless you had enough.

18:14.386 --> 18:18.015
No. I'm just getting started.

18:18.098 --> 18:19.725
Mm-hmm.

18:26.273 --> 18:28.525
[rooster crows]

18:28.609 --> 18:31.570
[goat bleats]

18:31.653 --> 18:33.447
[chickens clucking]

18:33.530 --> 18:35.908
[door creaks]

18:47.628 --> 18:50.255
Daddy!
I'm Li'l Kizzy.

18:50.339 --> 18:52.800
[crying]

18:55.886 --> 18:59.139
- Hi, Li'l Kizzy.
- Hi.

18:59.223 --> 19:01.683
That your little scamp?

19:01.767 --> 19:03.602
Virgil: Yeah,
that's... that's Uriah.

19:03.685 --> 19:04.978
I'm... I'm Virgil... sir.

19:05.062 --> 19:06.313
"Sir"?

19:06.396 --> 19:08.232
Boy, you my firstborn son.

19:08.315 --> 19:10.442
This is, uh...
this is my Lily Su.

19:10.526 --> 19:12.486
- That's me.
- Man and wife?

19:12.569 --> 19:14.589
Well, Lily Su's man got killed
when his wagon tipped,

19:14.613 --> 19:18.534
but, um, Massa Murray, he promises that...
that we can get married one day.

19:21.245 --> 19:22.704
You just as pretty
as the sunrise.

19:22.788 --> 19:26.208
- Almost pretty as me.
- [laughter]

19:26.291 --> 19:29.503
Ashford's our family cat.
Can't stay home at night.

19:29.586 --> 19:31.880
Well, we'll just have
to tie a bell to his paw

19:31.964 --> 19:33.590
so the gals
can hear him coming.

19:33.674 --> 19:36.468
- [laughter]
- [coughs]

19:36.552 --> 19:37.803
Oh, you James.

19:37.886 --> 19:39.471
That's right, Daddy.

19:39.555 --> 19:42.140
Boy, you was thin-boned
as a sparrow when I left.

19:42.224 --> 19:43.952
- [chuckles]
- Massa let a doctor come by here?

19:43.976 --> 19:46.186
Massa Frederick won't pay
for no doctor.

19:46.270 --> 19:48.397
Says we need
to use our own ways.

19:48.480 --> 19:51.984
I don't need to see a doctor, Daddy.
I feel stronger every day.

19:53.110 --> 19:56.488
And this is Irene,
with Tom's first baby.

19:57.948 --> 20:01.159
Got that Cherokee hair.

20:01.243 --> 20:02.923
You don't seem so high-strung
like she say.

20:02.995 --> 20:06.039
And you don't seem so foolish
and no-account,

20:06.123 --> 20:09.042
like my Tom says.

20:09.126 --> 20:11.169
[laughter]

20:11.253 --> 20:14.548
Where's Tom? Why ain't he standing
by you with that big belly?

20:14.631 --> 20:17.426
Massa Murray says Tom is
the best blacksmith in Carolina.

20:17.509 --> 20:19.428
Rents him out
all over the state.

20:19.511 --> 20:21.638
Helps Massa Murray
build his guns.

20:21.722 --> 20:24.683
Gets paid, too.
Saving to buy us free.

20:24.766 --> 20:26.226
A slave never can pay enough.

20:28.729 --> 20:29.730
Never.

20:36.028 --> 20:38.113
Where are my other children?

20:45.871 --> 20:49.124
George Jr., Louis,
and Mary

20:49.249 --> 20:53.462
got sold off a few weeks
after we came.

20:53.545 --> 20:57.424
Massa Murray said he sorry,
but he couldn't keep all of us.

20:57.507 --> 20:59.027
We tried to keep in touch
with them, Daddy,

20:59.051 --> 21:02.054
but, uh, ain't none of them
in Carolina no more.

21:07.809 --> 21:11.396
It's my fault... all of it.

21:11.480 --> 21:14.608
Now, you listen now.
I put my trust in false things.

21:14.691 --> 21:16.920
Thought I'd put on a show
for the massas, they act kindly.

21:16.944 --> 21:19.029
Thought they money
and hurrahs mean respect.

21:19.112 --> 21:21.448
I was a damn fool!

21:21.531 --> 21:23.951
I'm gonna keep
this family together,

21:24.034 --> 21:26.495
just like my mama Kizzy wanted,

21:26.578 --> 21:30.832
just like her Daddy,
Kunta Kinte, before her.

21:30.916 --> 21:34.836
Now, Daddy been gone
a long time.

21:34.920 --> 21:38.674
That ain't never gonna
happen again.

21:38.757 --> 21:41.802
Nancy Holt: "Mississippi,
Florida, Alabama

21:41.885 --> 21:45.639
have done their sacred duty to join
South Carolina in secession.

21:45.722 --> 21:50.394
It is time for North Carolina to stand up
and join her brothers."

21:50.477 --> 21:52.854
They printed
your entire letter, darling.

21:52.938 --> 21:55.190
We'll vote war,
and sooner than later.

21:55.315 --> 21:57.035
Charlotte: Frederick,
so many boys will die.

21:57.067 --> 21:58.902
Lincoln is weak.

21:58.986 --> 22:01.780
He won't dare send his soldiers
so far away from home.

22:01.863 --> 22:05.117
And if he does, in two weeks,
we'll declare victory.

22:05.200 --> 22:08.370
North Carolina will reward
the men that led us to freedom,

22:08.453 --> 22:10.622
turn to them for leadership
for a new country.

22:10.706 --> 22:12.791
Secession isn't something
everyone wants.

22:12.874 --> 22:14.918
It's too extreme.
Common sense can still prevail.

22:15.002 --> 22:17.421
Common sense abandoned
this country long ago.

22:17.504 --> 22:21.341
Why should New York and Boston
and Philadelphia tell us how to live?

22:21.425 --> 22:25.303
They don't understand.
There is no South without slavery.

22:25.387 --> 22:26.972
[chuckles]

22:27.055 --> 22:29.725
Haven't I found my match,
mother?

22:29.808 --> 22:31.059
Benjamin: Commence firing!

22:33.437 --> 22:35.981
Cannoneers, cease fire!

22:37.691 --> 22:38.984
Service the piece.

22:39.067 --> 22:41.403
Cannoneers, load!

22:41.486 --> 22:43.947
See, Massa Murray
runs test for the army.

22:44.031 --> 22:47.075
- Advance the round!
- Guns and cannons, bullets, too.

22:47.159 --> 22:48.493
Says if war comes,

22:48.577 --> 22:50.457
Southern boys gonna need
to make their own guns.

22:50.495 --> 22:53.874
Mm-hmm. What's your brother Tom
gonna do with all this?

22:53.957 --> 22:57.335
See, Massa Murray
asks his opinion all the time.

22:57.419 --> 22:59.059
If something gets made by
hammer and fire,

22:59.087 --> 23:00.630
Tom's the one massa depends on.

23:00.714 --> 23:02.716
Benjamin:
Cannoneers, commence firing!

23:05.761 --> 23:07.304
[horse whinnies]

23:07.387 --> 23:09.056
Watch out for Frederick,
though, Daddy.

23:09.139 --> 23:12.350
He part cannon hisself.
Never know when he going off.

23:12.434 --> 23:15.270
Cannoneers, load!

23:15.395 --> 23:19.024
Sorry I'm late, massa.
Just got back.

23:19.107 --> 23:21.068
Your father's been
anxious to see you.

23:21.151 --> 23:22.819

23:22.903 --> 23:25.906
Chicken George ain't
no cock-and-bull story, boy!

23:25.989 --> 23:27.741
Here's our Daddy hisself.

23:28.950 --> 23:32.412
And he's got lots of real good
stories to tell, too.

23:33.622 --> 23:36.875
Got no time for stories.
Got too much work now.

23:38.627 --> 23:40.295
Frederick: Daddy.

23:40.420 --> 23:43.381
We're getting quite
the collection on the farm.

23:43.465 --> 23:46.885
Every nigger
but the Lost Tribe of Israel.

23:46.968 --> 23:49.763
How long you plan on visiting
with us, Chicken George?

23:49.846 --> 23:51.389
Oh, I ain't visiting.

23:51.473 --> 23:54.601
I told Mr. Murray I'm living
here now with my family.

23:54.684 --> 23:57.813
Mrs. Murray relies
on Matilda.

23:57.896 --> 24:00.357
Having your father here has...
has brightened her mood.

24:00.440 --> 24:01.876
- Ready.
- That's a great kindness, sir,

24:01.900 --> 24:03.443
to be with my children again.

24:05.570 --> 24:08.782

Is everyone all right?

What went wrong?

24:24.965 --> 24:27.134
Need more precision
on the ball.

24:27.217 --> 24:28.677
Ain't truly round.

24:28.760 --> 24:30.178
How the hell do you know that?

24:30.262 --> 24:33.306
- By my hands.
- Nonsense.

24:33.390 --> 24:35.225
Bamboozle my father.

24:35.308 --> 24:37.310
You lie to me, I'll string you up
by your toes.

24:37.394 --> 24:38.645
Collect the pieces.

24:38.728 --> 24:42.232
Ashford, get over here
and help clean this up.

24:42.315 --> 24:45.068
Mr. Murray think
real highly of you, son.

24:45.152 --> 24:46.987
I keep on his good side.

24:47.070 --> 24:49.156
Ain't no good side
for no slave.

24:49.239 --> 24:52.075
Any good side dry up faster
than rain in a summer field.

24:52.159 --> 24:53.410
Bet on it.

24:53.493 --> 24:56.830
Betting is your game, not mine.

24:56.913 --> 25:00.625
If Massa Murray want to play papa to me,
I'm gonna let him.

25:00.709 --> 25:03.587
Do anything to make it easier
for my family.

25:08.049 --> 25:11.845
Ain't every nigger get made the fool
by his white daddy.

- There she is.

Bring another plate out here.

Miss Nancy's barkin' orders like
she runnin' the farm already.

25:46.546 --> 25:47.797
She can bark all she want.

25:47.881 --> 25:50.508
We just got to see
if her bite is bad as his.

25:50.592 --> 25:52.260
Her folks here?

25:52.344 --> 25:54.596
Both her folks died and left her
a place in Raleigh.

25:54.679 --> 25:57.307
She's a book-smart lady.

25:57.390 --> 26:01.645
Frederick fell for her as easy
as a slip on a river rock.

26:08.276 --> 26:09.861
What's wrong, son?

26:09.945 --> 26:11.196
Them boys right there?

26:11.279 --> 26:13.198
They Mr. Frederick
boyhood friends.

26:13.281 --> 26:16.326
They ain't even gonna let Abe Lincoln
on the ballot in North Carolina.

[applause]

26:20.455 --> 26:22.874
[Binta's lullaby plays]

26:32.592 --> 26:34.844
That's my mama's song.

26:34.928 --> 26:37.931
Every band in the county
plays it now.

26:38.014 --> 26:42.143
It's changed some,
but always the same.

26:42.227 --> 26:45.272
I can hear Mama Kizzy humming it.
[chuckles]

26:46.273 --> 26:48.275
These folks don't know
where it come from.

26:48.358 --> 26:51.361
Well, we do, mourning dove.

26:51.444 --> 26:52.946
Dance with me.

26:53.029 --> 26:54.990
George.
We ain't allowed.

26:55.073 --> 26:57.409
Oh, I'm allowed to dance
with my wife.

26:57.492 --> 26:59.286
[laughs]

26:59.369 --> 27:01.955
It's been years, George.

27:05.041 --> 27:07.210
[both chuckle]

27:15.010 --> 27:17.053
Nancy: Come on, honey.
Let's go back in.

27:21.016 --> 27:23.393
Stop it right now.
You shouldn't be around here.

27:23.476 --> 27:25.246
You know Massa Frederick
don't like you around here.

27:25.270 --> 27:28.773
Boy, why don't you worry more about
they working your Irene too hard?

27:28.857 --> 27:32.235
Go ahead, ask Massa Murray
to let her rest till the baby come,

27:32.319 --> 27:34.529
since he looking out
for you now like a father.

27:34.654 --> 27:36.281
Or maybe I'll just buy
my Irene free

27:36.364 --> 27:39.005
- with all that money you won in England.
- Both of you, stop this.

27:39.993 --> 27:42.412
I got to get back inside
to Miss Charlotte.

27:42.495 --> 27:44.914
[sighs]

27:48.293 --> 27:52.505
Took every penny I saved
to come home to my family.

27:52.589 --> 27:54.257
Hallelujah!

27:54.341 --> 27:55.925
Like mama's Daddy
used to preach.

27:56.009 --> 27:59.095
The old massa sent me to England.
I ain't got no choice.

27:59.179 --> 28:01.598
I was a slave.
What else could I do?

28:01.681 --> 28:04.851
All I ever heard was how you wanted
to gamble your way to be free.

28:04.934 --> 28:08.146
Ain't the truth, Daddy.
You liked it.

28:08.229 --> 28:10.065
[applause]

28:11.066 --> 28:14.110
Ain't no right way
to be a slave.

28:14.194 --> 28:18.198
Only thing they ever gonna
understand is this right here.

28:18.281 --> 28:19.824
You old fool!

28:19.908 --> 28:23.244
You keep flashing that gun around,
and we'll both be hanged from an oak tree.

28:29.834 --> 28:32.170
[indistinct conversations]

28:35.256 --> 28:37.401
Think I don't want to take my hammer
and cave in a man's head

28:37.425 --> 28:42.305
who spits at my brothers
or... or insults mama?

28:42.389 --> 28:44.974
But what happens next?

28:45.058 --> 28:48.269
After they kill me or...
or sell me?

28:48.353 --> 28:50.230
Who watches out for the family?

28:50.313 --> 28:55.402
But that was never you,
Daddy, 'cause you...

28:55.485 --> 29:01.116
you had to be Chicken George,
livin' the sportin' life!

29:09.916 --> 29:11.668
Let me hold your hand.
[chuckles]

29:13.002 --> 29:15.505
You know who holds hands?

29:15.588 --> 29:18.591
Mandinka warriors from Africa.

29:18.675 --> 29:21.678
They're the strongest, toughest
boys in this whole world.

29:21.761 --> 29:24.431
You got to teach my baby,
too, Daddy.

29:24.514 --> 29:26.391
Don't you worry.

29:26.474 --> 29:29.352
I got lots to teach you
about Kunta Kinte.

29:29.436 --> 29:30.520
[horse whinnies]

29:30.603 --> 29:34.524
As your lawyer, I'd prefer you to refrain
from shooting Chicken George.

29:34.607 --> 29:38.027
A trial requires my valuable time,
even played as a farce.

29:38.111 --> 29:40.572
Here's where you say
you have a smarter idea.

29:40.655 --> 29:43.741
[chuckles]
I have a smarter idea.

29:43.825 --> 29:46.369
North Carolina law's clear.

29:46.453 --> 29:51.124
Now, freedom granted to any slave
shall be upon the express condition

29:51.207 --> 29:54.878
that he leave the state within 90 days
and never return.

29:54.961 --> 29:56.671
How long has he been
on your farm?

29:56.796 --> 29:58.631
Over two months now.

29:58.715 --> 30:01.301
On the 91st day,
you can seize him and sell him.

30:01.384 --> 30:03.636
Why quibble over days
when you can just take him?

30:03.720 --> 30:06.055
No, no, keep it by the book.

30:06.139 --> 30:10.059
Old Chicken George will find out
I'm a bag of nails compared to my father.

30:10.143 --> 30:13.480
- You leaving here tonight.
- I'm right where I should be.

30:15.940 --> 30:18.318
Is this all the bread
you could find?

30:18.401 --> 30:20.963
Frederick and his friends ate through
the pantry like a plague of locusts.

30:20.987 --> 30:23.215
- Matilda, hold on.
- James will drive you to the Durham road.

30:23.239 --> 30:25.700
And don't go waving these papers
talking about you free.

30:27.076 --> 30:28.304
Might as well throw a stone
at a wasp nest.

30:28.328 --> 30:30.497
Get the small cart ready.

30:30.580 --> 30:32.224
We won't tell your brothers
or your sisters

30:32.248 --> 30:33.500
until your Daddy is far away.

30:36.503 --> 30:38.755
I ain't leaving.

30:38.838 --> 30:40.632
Hey.

30:40.715 --> 30:43.760
Mr. Murray ain't that bad,
and as for Frederick...

30:43.843 --> 30:45.905
And I'm telling you Massa Murray
grows older every day.

30:45.929 --> 30:48.306
Can't control Frederick.

30:48.389 --> 30:50.225
He is as bad as they come.

30:50.308 --> 30:51.726
He'll make your life a torment,

30:51.851 --> 30:53.686
then sell you Mississippi way
or kill you.

30:53.770 --> 30:55.438
I ain't scared of that boy.

30:57.565 --> 31:01.444
I can't leave you again.
And I won't.

31:01.528 --> 31:03.071
No.

31:09.744 --> 31:13.498
I prayed so hard
that you would come back,

31:13.581 --> 31:16.292
and we'd be free together,

31:16.376 --> 31:19.712
even after Massa Murray
sold the children.

31:19.796 --> 31:24.676
But if we can't be free together,
at least you'll be free.

31:24.759 --> 31:28.137
I know what
Mama Kizzy would say.

31:28.221 --> 31:32.475
"Do what your grandfather
would do.

31:32.559 --> 31:35.311
Keep moving north,
and don't ever look back."

31:38.565 --> 31:41.150
Promise me.

31:42.902 --> 31:44.112
I promise.

31:45.905 --> 31:47.615
For now, I'll go.

31:54.831 --> 31:58.084
I don't know how,

31:58.167 --> 32:02.088
and I don't know when,

32:02.171 --> 32:05.049
but I know I will be back for this.

32:12.473 --> 32:16.102
And next time, I ain't wavin'
no papers to be free.

32:16.185 --> 32:20.398
Ain't asking no permission
from nobody.

32:20.481 --> 32:24.777
Next time, my mourning dove,
I'm coming to take you.

32:33.036 --> 32:35.413
[door creaks]

32:55.808 --> 32:57.310
Take it, son.

33:06.402 --> 33:08.696
I'll make sure he does, Daddy.

33:13.701 --> 33:15.328
[smooching] Hyah.

33:15.411 --> 33:16.996
[horse neighs]

33:26.464 --> 33:29.217
Irene: Maria wants her Daddy
'fore he goes to work.

33:29.300 --> 33:31.260
Oh, my hands are rough
as tree bark.

33:31.344 --> 33:34.305
Talk to her.
Tell her 'bout Kunta Kinte.

33:34.389 --> 33:36.015
[sighs]

33:36.099 --> 33:38.142
Where'd you hear that name?

33:38.226 --> 33:42.146
Chicken George said Kunta Kinte
made these for Mama Kizzy.

33:42.230 --> 33:46.651
Your granddaddy from Africa.
The one they stole on a ship,

33:46.734 --> 33:48.903
then cut his foot off
so he wouldn't run off.

33:49.028 --> 33:50.798
Ain't got no time
for stories now, Irene. Come on.

33:50.822 --> 33:54.242
Chicken George said the Africans
say special words for a new baby.

33:54.325 --> 33:57.036
Say stories
bigger than Bible stories.

33:57.120 --> 34:00.915
Irene, when my... my Daddy
gets to talking, telling stories,

34:01.040 --> 34:02.917
it's best stop listening now.

34:03.042 --> 34:04.836
So, here.
Here.

34:06.212 --> 34:07.731
Right here, sir. Got these
special England papers.

34:07.755 --> 34:10.036
Coachman: All right, I got room
for two niggers up on top.

34:10.091 --> 34:11.731
- I got money.
- Show me money and papers.

34:11.759 --> 34:13.136
The rest can turn around.

34:13.219 --> 34:14.737
- Right here.
- Hey, hey, hey, say, boss.

34:14.762 --> 34:16.304
Say, boss.
We free men.

34:16.389 --> 34:17.869
We ought to be riding
inside this cab.

34:17.931 --> 34:19.851
No niggers inside.

34:19.934 --> 34:22.186
Easy, now, son,
or ain't none of us gettin' on.

34:22.270 --> 34:25.231
There's a war startin', old man,
sooner than later.

34:25.313 --> 34:28.025
I need to put some miles
between me and here.

34:28.109 --> 34:31.279
You know there ain't gonna be no safe
place once these crackers start shootin'.

34:31.362 --> 34:32.723
Hey, watch...
watch out, watch out.

34:32.739 --> 34:35.366
Hey, hey, hey,
here, here, here.

34:35.449 --> 34:36.993
What the hell is this, boy?

34:37.076 --> 34:38.512
That says I'm supposed to be
inside that carriage.

34:38.536 --> 34:40.705
[chuckles] It's just
a slip of old newsprint.

34:40.788 --> 34:43.040
- [grumbles]
- You. You, up top.

34:43.123 --> 34:45.752
- We could ride on the back.
- That's it. No more room.

34:45.835 --> 34:48.045
The rest of you have
to wait for the next one.

34:48.129 --> 34:50.672
Well, you handled that real good,
didn't you, son?

34:50.757 --> 34:54.719
Well, joke's on that cracker.
I can't read a word.

34:54.802 --> 34:56.053
- [laughs]
- [whip cracks]

34:56.137 --> 34:57.889
Get on it.
Come on.

34:57.972 --> 34:59.557
[horse whinnies]

34:59.640 --> 35:01.017
Ah... Cyrus.

35:01.100 --> 35:04.020
Owned by the Brickle farm,
Virginia.

35:04.103 --> 35:05.938
Caught me runnin' off
into Pennsylvania,

35:06.022 --> 35:09.400
sent me down to Tennessee.
I run off twice more.

35:09.484 --> 35:13.446
George. Chicken George.
Free man for true.

35:13.529 --> 35:15.656
It don't seem
to be helpin' me much.

35:15.740 --> 35:19.410
Hmm, well, I tell you what,
Chicken George, let's say we start walkin'

35:19.494 --> 35:22.079
'fore some Johnny Reb
try and put us back in chains.

35:22.163 --> 35:24.791
They say a nigger make his way
up to a Union fort,

35:24.874 --> 35:27.251
he can get a gun and fight.

35:27.335 --> 35:30.713
So, uh, what you waitin' on,
Chicken George?

35:30.797 --> 35:32.548
[chuckles]

35:44.936 --> 35:46.938
If you're moving in with us
once we're married,

35:47.021 --> 35:49.023
why fuss with this?

35:49.148 --> 35:51.025
Ostentatious,
don't you think, darling?

35:51.150 --> 35:53.444
I think I agree
with whatever you say.

35:55.488 --> 35:57.949
Too ordinary.

35:58.032 --> 36:00.076
I can forge anything you want,
Miss Nancy.

36:00.159 --> 36:02.245
Uh, I got all kinds
in my wagon.

36:02.328 --> 36:04.705
Would you like to come choose
with me, Frederick?

36:04.789 --> 36:07.500
I defer to your
superior judgment.

36:07.583 --> 36:10.753
- That the right answer?
- Always.

36:13.464 --> 36:15.675
Signal me if Frederick comes.

36:19.345 --> 36:21.472
I thought
he couldn't hear anything.

36:21.556 --> 36:23.266
Jerusalem is deaf and mute,

36:23.349 --> 36:25.476
but if you face him,
he can read lips.

36:28.896 --> 36:32.483
South Carolina is calling a convention
to vote on secession.

36:32.567 --> 36:33.860
Once they leave the Union,

36:33.943 --> 36:37.005
states like North Carolina are just gonna
fall in line like trees in a hurricane.

36:37.029 --> 36:39.716
- Don't know nothing about that, ma'am.
- Yes, you do. You read the newspapers.

36:39.740 --> 36:42.201
Matilda sneaks them from the kindling.
I've seen her.

36:42.285 --> 36:44.245
Most of your family reads.
That is a marvel.

36:44.328 --> 36:46.038
Ma'am, don't say
nothin' more, ma'am.

36:47.206 --> 36:49.834
Tom, I'm a spy for the North.

36:49.917 --> 36:54.422
I'm here to gather information
for Mr. Pinkerton in Washington.

36:54.505 --> 36:56.090
Intelligence, he calls it.

36:59.760 --> 37:06.100
Mr. Murray is aware of the Confederacy's
plans for weapons and explosives.

37:06.225 --> 37:09.353
You have a road pass,
and he trusts you, Tom.

37:09.437 --> 37:11.105
Will you help me?

37:11.230 --> 37:14.317
Nobody gonna hurt
a fancy lady like you.

37:14.400 --> 37:16.652
We slaves.

37:16.736 --> 37:20.072
They'll cut us down like wheat in a field
and won't think twice.

37:20.156 --> 37:22.408
I-I can't.
I won't.

37:22.491 --> 37:24.243
[Jerusalem clears throat]

37:27.330 --> 37:29.498
What's taking so long?

37:29.582 --> 37:32.209
This nigger trying
to get money out of you?

37:32.293 --> 37:34.253
They're like children,
always begging for more.

37:34.337 --> 37:37.465
No, darling.
But you know us women.

37:37.548 --> 37:40.968
Beautiful things dazzle us.
I just need time to decide.

37:44.722 --> 37:47.266
Man: Company, attention!

37:47.350 --> 37:48.768
March!

37:59.195 --> 38:02.198
[indistinct conversations]

38:06.702 --> 38:10.706
There.
Much better.

38:10.790 --> 38:12.917
A Major has to impress his men.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.919
As long as I impress you.

38:18.881 --> 38:20.633
Let's be careful, Daddy.

38:20.716 --> 38:23.219
Gentlemen, uh, this boy Tom's
the king of hooves.

38:23.302 --> 38:26.514
He knows more about a horse's feet
than the horse himself.

38:26.597 --> 38:30.518
I expect you
to look after every shoe

38:30.601 --> 38:32.937
on every horse
in our company every night.

38:33.020 --> 38:34.730
Yes, sir... uh, Major.

38:34.814 --> 38:38.067
Good shoes make good horses,
and good horses win wars.

38:38.150 --> 38:40.277
Who's really in command
of this company, Frederick?

38:40.361 --> 38:43.155
I report
to one commander, boys.

38:43.239 --> 38:44.490
[chuckles]

38:46.158 --> 38:49.245
Now, let's get this company
ready for battle.

38:55.459 --> 38:56.711
[gunfire]

38:56.794 --> 38:59.672
[panting]

39:05.052 --> 39:08.180
You reckon, uh, them Johnny Rebs
gave up huntin' us?

39:08.264 --> 39:10.099
Sure, Chicken George.

39:10.182 --> 39:14.687
I reckon they changed their mind all about
niggers going to fight for Abe Lincoln.

39:14.770 --> 39:16.022
[chuckles]

39:18.065 --> 39:20.943
You reckon you're too old
for this, Chicken George?

39:21.027 --> 39:22.486
[panting]

39:22.570 --> 39:24.363
What's new, boy?

39:26.574 --> 39:28.284
Man gave me this.

39:30.369 --> 39:31.972
You ain't got to unfold it.
Just give it here.

39:31.996 --> 39:33.998
I ain't much good with words.

39:34.081 --> 39:36.709
Well, you know,
I got a notion to read, but...

39:36.792 --> 39:38.044
[chuckles]

39:38.127 --> 39:39.795
"Memphis Battery D,

39:39.879 --> 39:42.965
2nd United States
Light Artillery

39:43.049 --> 39:45.676
seeks volunteers
of African descent."

39:45.760 --> 39:47.219
Oh, that's us.

39:47.303 --> 39:49.221
"Pay... $13 a month."

39:49.305 --> 39:53.726
$13 a month?
I'll fight two wars for $13 a month.

39:53.809 --> 39:56.687
Man said there was a recruiting
office on Knoxville Turnpike.

39:56.771 --> 39:58.022
- [twigs crack]
- Shh, shh.

39:59.940 --> 40:02.151
Ohh! Go!

40:02.234 --> 40:04.862
- [gunfire, bullets ricocheting]
- Run, run!

40:04.945 --> 40:07.281
[indistinct shouting]

40:13.621 --> 40:14.914
Go, George.

40:14.997 --> 40:16.999
[gunfire, bullets ricocheting]

40:28.094 --> 40:30.471
[horse whinnies]

40:30.554 --> 40:32.807
- How?
- Move!

40:35.434 --> 40:37.019
Soldier:
Come back here, boy!

40:40.981 --> 40:42.650
[groans]

40:42.733 --> 40:44.693
[horse whinnies]

40:52.034 --> 40:53.452
Whew.

40:53.536 --> 40:55.913
[panting]

40:57.581 --> 41:00.584
You going
the wrong way, George.

41:00.668 --> 41:02.503
Chicken George,
you going the wrong way.

41:02.586 --> 41:03.838
What are you doing?

41:03.921 --> 41:05.631
You ride much, Cyrus?

41:05.714 --> 41:08.259
Don't trust these tough buggers
one bit myself.

41:08.342 --> 41:09.969
But let's go.
Come on.

41:10.052 --> 41:11.655
- Come on.
- Let's find us Memphis Battery.

41:11.679 --> 41:13.681
[clicks tongue]

41:14.682 --> 41:16.600
[crickets chirping]

41:24.900 --> 41:26.902
Man:
Shut up and keep still!

41:30.656 --> 41:32.783
- [crying]
- Shut up!

41:32.867 --> 41:34.743
Irene: Please, no!

41:34.827 --> 41:36.245
No! No!

41:36.328 --> 41:38.330
Get out of here.
Now, Tom...

41:38.414 --> 41:40.833
- Shut up, I said!
- Tom...

41:40.916 --> 41:42.793
- Come on, now.
- Help!

41:42.877 --> 41:44.128
Who that is?

41:44.211 --> 41:45.504
- Irene!
- No!

41:45.588 --> 41:47.965
- That's my wife. Get off me.
- No!

41:48.048 --> 41:49.276
- Come on, now.
- Break his wrists if you have to!

41:49.300 --> 41:51.719
- No, please!
- Hold him down!

41:51.802 --> 41:53.762
[screaming]

41:53.846 --> 41:55.407
I'm not gonna hurt her
unless you make me.

41:55.431 --> 41:56.724
- Irene!
- Tom!

41:56.807 --> 42:00.644
You gonna wait there and let me
and my boys get through with it.

42:00.728 --> 42:03.647
[screaming]

42:03.731 --> 42:06.066
[Tom whimpering]

42:06.150 --> 42:07.526
Tom.

42:10.362 --> 42:12.740
[gun clicking]

42:19.163 --> 42:20.706
Just tell me
what you want me to do.

42:24.710 --> 42:27.463
Confederate officer,
Major John Marrett,

42:27.546 --> 42:29.757
has arrived here
on his way to Augusta.

42:29.840 --> 42:33.427
The South's rushing to build a new arsenal
and it must be stopped.

42:34.428 --> 42:37.514
- Nigger doing his job, ma'am?
- Fine, thanks.

42:37.598 --> 42:39.725
Well, hurry it up, boy.

42:46.190 --> 42:49.860
The dispatches he carries
have the designs and supply routes.

42:51.362 --> 42:52.613
What do I do?

42:52.696 --> 42:57.409
Help us kill him on his way south.
Then we'll take the plans north.

42:57.493 --> 42:59.078
You're talking.
You're a fake?

42:59.161 --> 43:03.082
Don't get all boiled into a jelly.
Charles Montpelier.

43:03.165 --> 43:08.170
Mr. Pinkerton asked Charles to cross
into slave territory to guide me.

43:08.254 --> 43:09.964
He's putting his life at risk.

43:10.047 --> 43:11.858
Kill that Major... my whole family
be at risk, too.

43:11.882 --> 43:13.634
Only ain't their choice.

43:13.717 --> 43:17.763
I have a family, too, Tom.
Wife, four children.

43:17.846 --> 43:19.640
I miss them every day.

43:19.723 --> 43:23.727
But the truth is I couldn't live
in safety any longer,

43:23.811 --> 43:27.273
not knowing how
my people suffered as slaves.

43:27.356 --> 43:30.025
How do we stop
three riders, Tom?

43:30.109 --> 43:32.236
Frederick and his troops
will be gone,

43:32.319 --> 43:35.489
and Marrett only has
an escort of two men.

43:35.614 --> 43:39.660
Massa Murray built hand charges
he copied from a Northern grenade.

43:39.743 --> 43:41.578
Toss 'em like a rock.

43:41.662 --> 43:44.456
Stop 'em for sure.

43:44.540 --> 43:46.250
Can you get them?

43:46.333 --> 43:47.960
He stores them away
from the house.

43:48.043 --> 43:51.213
All right.
Once we have the intelligence,

43:51.297 --> 43:55.884
Nancy will head for Philadelphia,
and I'm for the Union lines.

43:55.968 --> 43:58.929
They'll blame us, not you.

43:59.013 --> 44:01.390
Well, not if they catch me.

44:16.113 --> 44:17.781
Tom, what you doing?

44:17.865 --> 44:19.700
Oh, shh.

44:21.827 --> 44:23.537
Go back to sleep now.

44:23.662 --> 44:25.372
Why are you up so early?

44:25.456 --> 44:28.292
Irene, the way to help me...
don't ask me anything.

44:36.300 --> 44:38.969
Chicken George used to say

44:39.053 --> 44:41.597
his mama used to talk
to Kunta Kinte all the time.

44:41.680 --> 44:45.684
Said the African used to come to her
when she was scared.

44:45.768 --> 44:49.688
Don't know if it's for true,
but maybe ain't no difference.

44:50.981 --> 44:54.234
It's the askin' him to help us
makes the difference.

45:05.537 --> 45:07.724
Jerusalem: Throw the grenade
and try to kill all of them,

45:07.748 --> 45:09.628
then we can take
the plans off the Major's body.

45:09.708 --> 45:12.461
After that,
you double back to the farm.

45:12.544 --> 45:16.715
Frederick and the Rangers are away,
so nobody's gonna miss you.

45:17.925 --> 45:20.511
Hey.

45:20.594 --> 45:22.554
Kneel with me, Tom.

45:22.638 --> 45:24.723
Come on.

45:24.807 --> 45:26.058
[sighs]

45:28.852 --> 45:32.398
When it comes to standing up
for a cause, help me, Lord,

45:32.481 --> 45:36.360
that I remain a candle
in the storm,

45:36.443 --> 45:38.821
and let no evil...

45:38.904 --> 45:43.700
smother my low,
but powerful, glow.

45:43.784 --> 45:46.161
- Amen.
- All right.

45:46.245 --> 45:47.871
Go on. Go on.

45:50.791 --> 45:52.418
[sighs]

46:05.180 --> 46:07.141
[sighs]

46:11.520 --> 46:13.939
[horse whinnies]

46:17.151 --> 46:21.113
Frederick: They sent me back
with new dispatches for Major Marrett.

46:21.196 --> 46:25.576
Well, you just missed him, Frederick.
He's already left for Augusta.

46:25.659 --> 46:29.663
Well, tell Tilda to fry me up
a dozen eggs.

46:29.788 --> 46:32.833
I'll be back 'fore they're cold.
We'll catch up to him.

46:32.916 --> 46:34.918
Benjamin: Be safe.

46:39.047 --> 46:41.049
[horse snorting]

46:47.264 --> 46:48.599
[horse whinnies]

46:52.311 --> 46:53.312
[gun cocks]

47:10.120 --> 47:12.539
[horses neighing]

47:26.637 --> 47:29.181
[grunts] [coughs]

47:36.772 --> 47:38.565
Come on, come on.

47:40.734 --> 47:42.569
[grunts]

47:45.864 --> 47:47.991
Go. Go.

47:48.075 --> 47:50.619
[horse snorts]

47:50.702 --> 47:52.621
Frederick:
It can't be much further.

47:52.704 --> 47:54.540
It was over here.
This way. Come on.

47:59.253 --> 48:00.504
[horse whinnying]

48:03.590 --> 48:05.676
Whoa.

48:09.137 --> 48:10.889
- [branch snaps]
- Whoa.

48:29.491 --> 48:31.910
[panting]

48:40.711 --> 48:45.215
We caught one of the assassins,
but there were two.

48:45.299 --> 48:47.759
The other escaped
in the forest.

48:47.843 --> 48:50.596
I'm sure you'll find the other criminal.

48:50.679 --> 48:53.432
Yes, we will.

48:53.515 --> 48:56.810
I'm just thankful
that you weren't hurt.

48:56.935 --> 48:58.979
So am I, my love.

48:59.062 --> 49:03.233
You're always so thoughtful
and concerned for me and my family.

49:03.317 --> 49:04.735
[gasps]

49:06.987 --> 49:09.114
Oh, did I...

49:09.197 --> 49:12.534
did I mention that you know
the one we caught?

49:12.618 --> 49:16.079
How could that be possible?

49:16.163 --> 49:19.458
Jerusalem.

49:19.541 --> 49:20.834
Get up.

49:20.959 --> 49:22.294
[grunting]

49:22.377 --> 49:24.546
Get up.

49:24.630 --> 49:27.132
Did you know he speaks?

49:27.215 --> 49:29.968
Of course, with a little bit
of prompting,

49:30.052 --> 49:35.349
perhaps you'll have more success
encouraging him to reveal his secrets.

49:35.432 --> 49:38.185
[coughing] [gasping]

49:39.394 --> 49:41.164
This is unseemly.
I'm going back to the house.

49:41.188 --> 49:42.898
Darling!

49:42.981 --> 49:48.612
Ask your nigger who is he,
besides a spy and a murderer.

49:50.656 --> 49:52.991
Why was he working for you?

49:53.075 --> 49:55.869
And ask him the names
of all of his conspirators,

49:55.994 --> 49:57.496
everyone who intrigued
with him.

49:57.579 --> 50:00.123
Do this,
and I will spare his life.

50:02.292 --> 50:06.922
Of course... we already know
you were involved.

50:07.005 --> 50:09.299
Do you?

50:10.550 --> 50:12.678
We searched your house,

50:12.761 --> 50:15.806
found your letters
to Mr. Pinkerton,

50:15.889 --> 50:18.725
notes on our troop movements.

50:20.227 --> 50:21.770
String him up, boys.

50:21.853 --> 50:23.230
[grunting]

50:23.313 --> 50:24.981
Wait!

50:25.065 --> 50:26.650
Wait, wait.

50:26.733 --> 50:30.070
If I tell you what you want,
will you spare him?

50:33.699 --> 50:37.202
What choice do you have
but to try me?

50:37.285 --> 50:39.663
[grunting, panting]

50:42.833 --> 50:45.293
His name's Charles Montpelier.

50:45.377 --> 50:49.131
He's a minister, an editor,
a teacher from Philadelphia...

50:51.091 --> 50:53.301
...and a dear friend.

50:53.385 --> 50:55.387
[scoffs]

50:58.306 --> 51:00.225
[gasps]

51:00.308 --> 51:03.019
Why would you do this to me?

51:03.103 --> 51:07.274
I believe men and women
can't be owned like cattle.

51:07.357 --> 51:09.985
I believe slavery is evil.

51:10.068 --> 51:12.863
You pray in a church
to a loving God,

51:12.946 --> 51:17.159
but you defend this sin against men
and women created in His image?

51:17.242 --> 51:19.119
This is a chance
to save your soul.

51:19.202 --> 51:20.871
- [groans]
- Frederick!

51:20.954 --> 51:22.330
Frederick!

51:22.414 --> 51:24.207
Frederick, listen to me!
Listen to me.

51:24.291 --> 51:27.085
You send Nancy...
you send her to Richmond

51:27.169 --> 51:28.813
and let the authorities
handle this matter.

51:28.837 --> 51:30.922
The war has confused
many honorable people, son.

51:31.006 --> 51:32.674
Daddy, she is
a liar and a traitor.

51:32.758 --> 51:34.509
Take him.
Take him away.

51:34.593 --> 51:37.179
- Unhand me.
- Get up, get up.

51:37.262 --> 51:40.849
Listen to me, Frederick.
You do not disobey me, son.

51:40.932 --> 51:42.684
Enough, Daddy.

51:42.768 --> 51:45.103
You give me one name...

51:45.187 --> 51:48.148
just one,
and I'll send you to Richmond.

51:48.231 --> 51:50.233
Who else was involved?

51:54.905 --> 51:57.282
The intrigue was my own.

51:57.365 --> 51:59.409
There's no one else.

51:59.493 --> 52:01.536
[scoffs]

52:03.914 --> 52:05.832
Ride!

52:05.916 --> 52:08.001
Ride!

52:08.126 --> 52:09.294
[gagging]

52:09.377 --> 52:11.880
No higher. No higher.

52:11.963 --> 52:13.882
Let this boy take his time.

52:13.965 --> 52:14.965
[gagging]

52:26.019 --> 52:29.314
You... you love
this nigger more than me!

52:29.397 --> 52:31.650
Frederick, you stop this!
You stop this!

52:31.733 --> 52:33.127
- Get off me!
- Let her go! Toomey, grab him.

52:33.151 --> 52:34.444
- Let her go!
- Frederick.

52:34.528 --> 52:35.987
Clingman, give me my rope.

52:36.071 --> 52:38.824
- Listen to your father, Frederick.
- Ballard.

52:38.907 --> 52:41.910
Anderson, give me another rope.
That is a direct order.

52:41.993 --> 52:45.580
No, Frederick, I forbid this!
Not on my farm!

52:45.664 --> 52:46.957
Not on my farm!

52:47.040 --> 52:50.126
Don't you do this, Frederick!
Don't you do this!

53:20.115 --> 53:22.117
[fife and drum march plays]

53:23.326 --> 53:25.245
Man: Keep moving.

53:25.328 --> 53:26.580
Pick it up in the back.

53:30.083 --> 53:32.168
Can't hardly feel my feet.

53:32.252 --> 53:34.421
Think the Major ever
gonna give his horse a rest?

53:34.504 --> 53:37.757
Not unless it stands up and beg.

53:37.841 --> 53:40.635
Captain said Fort Pillow's
on real high ground.

53:40.719 --> 53:42.554
Hard to get at.

53:42.637 --> 53:44.306
- Should be plenty safe.
- Mm-hmm.

53:44.389 --> 53:48.602
Don't you be no fool, boy.
Not one of us safe.

53:48.685 --> 53:52.063
No, not from that nigger-hating
Reb Nathan Forrest.

53:52.147 --> 53:53.815
Heard his head turns full round

53:53.899 --> 53:56.109
when he sees a nigger
in a blue uniform.

53:56.234 --> 53:58.320
And they say
this war about over.

53:58.403 --> 54:00.655
That's for true. The South's
just about broken in two.

54:00.739 --> 54:03.575
Keep moving.
Keep moving, men.

54:03.658 --> 54:06.095
- Boy, don't you do nothing foolish now.
- Officer: Stay together.

54:06.119 --> 54:08.389
Sometimes you got to keep what's
in your head quiet, right?

54:08.413 --> 54:10.582
Yeah, uh-huh.
Don't you worry.

54:10.665 --> 54:13.084
I ain't gonna do nothing...
nothing foolish at all.

54:13.168 --> 54:15.003
Whoa.

54:15.086 --> 54:18.256
Hey, say, when we gonna get our sidearms
and rifles so we can fight, Major?

54:18.340 --> 54:20.383
You have a job, boy,
at your battery.

54:20.467 --> 54:23.762
Keep those cannons barking.
Do that and make me proud.

54:23.845 --> 54:26.431
Make you proud.
Get me killed by a Reb.

54:26.514 --> 54:28.099
I decide myself I want
to get shot.

54:28.183 --> 54:30.286
You give me a rifle, and I fight
for my own damn freedom.

54:30.310 --> 54:31.871
- [chuckling] All right, Private.
- Hyah!

54:31.895 --> 54:33.815
Don't mean nothing by it, sir.
Just too much sun.

54:33.897 --> 54:36.316
Makes him loopy.

54:36.399 --> 54:38.234
Boy, you ever keep
your goddamn mouth shut?

54:38.318 --> 54:41.905
[chuckles] I'm just tryin' to help
these white boys win this war, is all.

54:41.988 --> 54:43.466
- [laughs]
- Get your ass back in line.

54:43.490 --> 54:46.034
Ah...

54:52.123 --> 54:55.835
[gunfire, indistinct shouting]

54:55.919 --> 54:57.504
Battery, fire!

55:07.847 --> 55:10.433
Double canister.
Load, load!

55:15.355 --> 55:17.190
[soldiers shouting]

55:18.191 --> 55:19.359
Come on!

55:25.323 --> 55:26.741
Advance the round!

55:30.745 --> 55:32.625
Move that punch.
Them Rebs ain't waiting on you!

55:32.706 --> 55:34.207
Can't hold them off!

55:36.584 --> 55:38.128
Battery!

55:41.840 --> 55:43.560
Can't get an angle
on these sons of bitches.

55:43.633 --> 55:47.095
- It won't go down.
- We got to move this gun down!

55:49.139 --> 55:51.224
That's two degrees!
We got to do better!

55:51.349 --> 55:54.477
Ready! Fire!

55:54.561 --> 55:56.730
Confederate: The cannons
are overshooting!

55:56.813 --> 55:58.732
Advance!
Go!

56:03.153 --> 56:05.113
It's not gonna happen!
Get down!

56:05.196 --> 56:06.573
Get down, boys!
Come on!

56:10.368 --> 56:12.287
Get in here!
Come on!

56:12.370 --> 56:13.872
How'd I end up here?

56:13.955 --> 56:17.375
Man said if I joined the Union boys,
they'd take me back up North with them.

56:17.459 --> 56:19.335
When we leave here,
you gonna be just fine.

56:19.419 --> 56:22.797
Go wherever you want. You leave here,
you gonna be a free man. You hear me?

56:22.881 --> 56:24.775
Confederate soldier: I'm gonna blow
your brains out, boy!

56:24.799 --> 56:27.177
Chain you to my mule, nigger!

56:27.260 --> 56:28.970
Nathan Forrest
don't take nigger prisoners!

56:29.054 --> 56:32.390
- Hear that?
- That ain't good news.

56:32.474 --> 56:34.434
Why aren't you
manning your battery?

56:34.517 --> 56:36.478
No good, sir!
Barrel won't suppress enough.

56:36.561 --> 56:37.997
We shooting
straight over their heads!

56:38.021 --> 56:39.898
Major Booth gonna surrender
the fort, sir?

56:39.981 --> 56:42.835
Major Booth's dead, but I'm sure Major
Bradford will make the honorable choice.

56:42.859 --> 56:45.020
The honorable choice would have
been to give us rifles.

56:45.070 --> 56:46.950
We could have ran
them Rebs back over that hill.

56:53.119 --> 56:55.914
Move! Move! Move!
We're not safe here!

56:55.997 --> 56:58.875
- Don't stop! Go.
- Get that side arm, George.

56:58.958 --> 57:01.294
[bullets ricocheting]

57:05.090 --> 57:07.509
[indistinct shouting]

57:08.593 --> 57:10.428
Get down, get down!

57:20.271 --> 57:22.482
Union soldier: We surrender now!
We surrender!

57:22.565 --> 57:24.943
[soldiers shouting]

57:27.362 --> 57:28.822
We surrender!

57:30.907 --> 57:32.534
Don't shoot!

57:32.617 --> 57:34.994
[indistinct shouting]

57:38.289 --> 57:39.541
We gonna surrender now, too?

57:39.624 --> 57:42.001
[indistinct shouting]

57:50.301 --> 57:52.846
You hang on now.
Not so sure.

57:52.929 --> 57:54.809
Them white boys giving up.
Why can't we, George?

57:54.848 --> 57:56.099
You stay right here.

57:56.182 --> 57:58.101
- Wait, wait.
- I got to go.

57:58.184 --> 58:00.103
Fool.

58:00.186 --> 58:01.855
I surrender!
I surrender!

58:01.938 --> 58:03.398
Don't shoot!

58:03.481 --> 58:04.961
Union soldier 2:
I don't want no more!

58:04.983 --> 58:06.484
I don't want no more!

58:11.072 --> 58:13.491
[guns cocking]

58:16.286 --> 58:18.705
[gunfire]

58:26.796 --> 58:30.341
Confederate: Come on,
kill those nigger bastards...

58:30.425 --> 58:31.843
every last one of them!

58:31.926 --> 58:34.087
- I'm gonna kill them.
- You won't get two steps! Move!

58:37.098 --> 58:41.019
- # Oh, how long, how long #
- George!

58:41.102 --> 58:45.231
# Before the sun goes down? #

58:45.315 --> 58:49.903
- # Oh, how long, how long #
- No! No! No!

58:49.986 --> 58:54.616
- # Before the sun goes down? #
- Stop! Stop! Stop!

58:54.699 --> 58:59.621
# I wish I had a title
when I was young #

58:59.704 --> 59:03.958
# Before the sun goes down #

59:04.042 --> 59:08.838
# I never woulda
had-a this race to run #

59:08.922 --> 59:13.426
# Before the sun goes down #

59:13.551 --> 59:17.889
# Oh, how long, how long #

59:17.972 --> 59:22.268
# Before the sun goes down? #

59:22.352 --> 59:26.981
# Oh, how long, how long #

59:27.065 --> 59:30.944
# Before the sun goes down? #

59:43.748 --> 59:46.000
- [grunts]
- They shot 'em.

59:46.084 --> 59:48.211
They shot them all...
all the colored boys.

59:48.294 --> 59:50.296
They was just trying
to surrender.

59:50.380 --> 59:52.548
How you do something like that?

59:52.632 --> 59:54.133
What kind of men are they?

59:54.217 --> 59:57.762
Maybe ain't men.
Maybe something else.

59:57.845 --> 59:59.764
- Something come out in war.
- [groans]

01:00:01.891 --> 01:00:04.435
You know what
you doing, George?

01:00:04.519 --> 01:00:06.020
I got a rough idea.

01:00:06.104 --> 01:00:07.939
[groans] No!

01:00:08.022 --> 01:00:09.607
[groans]

01:00:09.691 --> 01:00:11.818
You know, you's a good, old man,
Chicken George.

01:00:11.901 --> 01:00:13.194
[groaning]

01:00:16.698 --> 01:00:19.033
Ah...

01:00:19.117 --> 01:00:23.121
Tell me a story, George,
about the African.

01:00:24.497 --> 01:00:28.084
My granddaddy is Kunta Kinte.

01:00:28.167 --> 01:00:33.131
He a Mandinka warrior they stole away
across the ocean on the Kamby Bolongo.

01:00:33.214 --> 01:00:34.882
Ka-Kamby...
Kamby Bolongo.

01:00:34.966 --> 01:00:37.510
That's... that's a big river,
like the Mississippi?

01:00:37.802 --> 01:00:41.931
That's right. Kunta Kinte
could ride and swim.

01:00:42.015 --> 01:00:43.349
Couldn't no man break him.

01:00:43.433 --> 01:00:45.893
[groaning]

01:00:48.896 --> 01:00:51.524
I figure I got
some new stories now.

01:00:51.649 --> 01:00:55.945
This young boy named Cyrus...
can't nobody tell him nothing.

01:00:56.029 --> 01:00:57.322
But the way I see it,

01:00:57.405 --> 01:01:03.786
that boy saved an old man like me
in a hard, hard place.

01:01:03.870 --> 01:01:06.122
Wait a minute. Wait.
Wait a minute, George.

01:01:06.205 --> 01:01:08.207
Listen, my mama had a prayer

01:01:08.291 --> 01:01:12.211
she used to say to me
back when I was sick.

01:01:12.295 --> 01:01:14.464
You know,
before they sold me off.

01:01:14.547 --> 01:01:17.508
- Now would be the time.
- I know.

01:01:17.592 --> 01:01:22.513
I know, oh, Lord,
my flesh may fail,

01:01:22.597 --> 01:01:26.684
but God is the strength
of my heart.

01:01:26.768 --> 01:01:29.312
- [grunting]
- [groaning]

01:01:45.328 --> 01:01:47.246
Hey, come see this.

01:01:47.330 --> 01:01:50.458
Get your ass out here
and come and see this!

01:01:50.541 --> 01:01:52.752
[cows mooing]

01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:57.632
You know this herd, James?

01:01:57.715 --> 01:02:01.052
Look like Massa Anson's cows,
but that's four miles from here.

01:02:01.135 --> 01:02:03.175
Well, why his slaves
ain't stop them from wandering?

01:02:03.221 --> 01:02:05.932
I've been up by the big house.
Everybody gone.

01:02:06.015 --> 01:02:07.809
- Gone?
- All of them.

01:02:07.892 --> 01:02:09.227
Where they gone?

01:02:13.606 --> 01:02:15.942
[indistinct chattering]

01:02:19.404 --> 01:02:20.863
Boy: Mom!

01:02:20.947 --> 01:02:22.865
Hey, hey!

01:02:22.949 --> 01:02:24.909
Hey!

01:02:24.992 --> 01:02:26.744
- General Lee's gone home.
- What?

01:02:26.828 --> 01:02:28.329
The war's over for good.

01:02:28.413 --> 01:02:29.872
[chuckles]

01:02:29.956 --> 01:02:33.543
Overseer can blow his work horn
all he wants, but we ain't slaves no more.

01:02:33.626 --> 01:02:35.187
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
ain't no more secession?

01:02:35.211 --> 01:02:37.004
Not one more day.

01:02:37.088 --> 01:02:38.840
[all murmuring]

01:02:38.923 --> 01:02:40.818
I heard it from a white man
down at the courthouse.

01:02:40.842 --> 01:02:44.053
Hey say Robert Lee...
he know he done for.

01:02:44.137 --> 01:02:46.264
And so he gave him his horse
and his sword,

01:02:46.347 --> 01:02:48.891
but old Ulysses
wouldn't take it.

01:02:48.975 --> 01:02:50.977
He just said,
"You go on home now.

01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:54.230
Stop this foolishness."
[laughs]

01:02:54.313 --> 01:02:57.984
So I tell you this war is over,
and we ain't slaves!

01:02:58.067 --> 01:03:00.945
[all cheering]

01:03:01.028 --> 01:03:04.532
Tom, right now,
right here, we free.

01:03:04.615 --> 01:03:07.034
[cheering continues]

01:03:07.118 --> 01:03:09.704
- Mama.
- Is it true?

01:03:47.325 --> 01:03:50.536
Blessed is this earth...

01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:54.248
'cause my people lie beneath it.

01:03:54.332 --> 01:03:59.879
Blessed is the rain,
because it moistens their faces.

01:03:59.962 --> 01:04:01.797
Blessed is the wind...

01:04:01.881 --> 01:04:06.594
because it carries
their names back to us.

01:04:06.677 --> 01:04:08.387
Kunta Kinte.

01:04:11.390 --> 01:04:14.268
Belle.

01:04:14.352 --> 01:04:16.979
Mama Kizzy.

01:04:17.063 --> 01:04:19.899
Miss Malizy.

01:04:19.982 --> 01:04:22.985
Sarah.

01:04:23.069 --> 01:04:24.320
My children,

01:04:24.403 --> 01:04:27.865
Louis, Mary, and George Jr.

01:04:29.575 --> 01:04:33.579
My Daddy, Benjamin Lyon.

01:04:35.039 --> 01:04:38.251
[voice breaking]
And my husband, George.

01:04:38.334 --> 01:04:40.878
[crying]

01:04:40.962 --> 01:04:43.297
[indistinct conversations]

01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:51.806
I'm so thankful this war is done.

01:04:51.889 --> 01:04:55.059
Just don't ask me
to heft up my skirt and dance.

01:04:57.061 --> 01:05:02.149
I can't measure these days
in flags and armies.

01:05:03.568 --> 01:05:07.697
Only in the ones
that I'm missing.

01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:10.157
[shudders]

01:05:17.415 --> 01:05:21.794
Out here, working
just as hard as before.

01:05:21.919 --> 01:05:24.130
Not a bad idea
if you want to eat.

01:05:24.213 --> 01:05:25.965
Didn't know "free"
meant hungry.

01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:30.612
We'd like to know
where we stand, sir.

01:05:30.636 --> 01:05:32.638
Freedman: What we supposed
to do about food?

01:05:32.722 --> 01:05:35.266
You done locked all the sheds.
You moved all the hogs.

01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:37.590
We don't even know where the...
where the grain got taken.

01:05:37.602 --> 01:05:40.771
Well, I'm happy
to announce that, uh,

01:05:40.855 --> 01:05:43.774
every three acres of my land
that you clear and plant,

01:05:43.858 --> 01:05:46.402
I'll pay you one chicken
and one hog.

01:05:46.485 --> 01:05:50.740
And you can rent back, uh, farmland
and your cabins at a fair price.

01:05:50.823 --> 01:05:52.408
A fair price?

01:05:52.491 --> 01:05:56.037
- For the massa or the nigger?
- We'll think on it a while.

01:05:56.120 --> 01:06:00.249
Well, be of good cheer.
Things will improve.

01:06:00.333 --> 01:06:03.085
[clicks tongue] [horse neighs]

01:06:03.169 --> 01:06:06.547
I thought we won that damn war.

01:06:15.598 --> 01:06:18.100
Who is this coming?

01:06:20.019 --> 01:06:24.231
- This the... this the Murray farm?
- Yes, sir.

01:06:24.315 --> 01:06:26.192
Tom:
Can we help you, friend?

01:06:26.275 --> 01:06:27.544
Can you help me?
Maybe you can. Maybe you can't.

01:06:27.568 --> 01:06:29.111
Well, you need
to state your business.

01:06:29.195 --> 01:06:30.696
No.

01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:35.618
First, I need you
to answer my question.

01:06:36.702 --> 01:06:38.579
And you best get it right.

01:06:38.663 --> 01:06:41.540
Who is Kunta Kinte?

01:06:45.544 --> 01:06:50.174
No more than 20 of us colored boys
make it out of Fort Pillow alive.

01:06:50.257 --> 01:06:55.388
Oh, no. Ol' Nathan Forrest
couldn't kill us fast enough.

01:06:55.471 --> 01:06:59.266
After I got shot,
me and George,

01:06:59.350 --> 01:07:03.020
we took to the woods,
then to the river.

01:07:03.104 --> 01:07:05.314
Mm-hmm.

01:07:10.361 --> 01:07:13.239
Yeah, you must be Tom.

01:07:13.322 --> 01:07:16.909
He said you had arms
as big as cannonballs.

01:07:17.034 --> 01:07:19.412
[chuckles]

01:07:19.495 --> 01:07:22.873
Say you were smarter
than Jeff Davis' own engineers.

01:07:22.957 --> 01:07:25.835
He said you were
the hunger in his heart.

01:07:25.918 --> 01:07:28.129
He did.

01:07:28.212 --> 01:07:30.297
Mm-hmm.

01:07:30.381 --> 01:07:32.049
[chuckles]

01:07:33.884 --> 01:07:35.553
Yeah.

01:07:35.636 --> 01:07:37.596
Mighty fine food here.

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:39.682
What happened to my husband?

01:07:39.765 --> 01:07:42.560
Old George,
he carried me to the hospital.

01:07:42.643 --> 01:07:45.271
That was long after
he cut off my arm here.

01:07:45.354 --> 01:07:47.440
- Grandpa cut off his arm?
- Son.

01:07:47.523 --> 01:07:49.150
[chuckles] Yes.

01:07:49.233 --> 01:07:52.445
Yes, he did.
It's okay.

01:07:52.528 --> 01:07:54.572
Only reason I'm alive now.

01:07:54.655 --> 01:07:56.699
Old George say
he was gonna walk home.

01:07:56.782 --> 01:07:59.618
Say that's what a Mandinka
warrior would do.

01:07:59.702 --> 01:08:01.579
And then a man showed up.

01:08:01.662 --> 01:08:05.249
Reverend Garland, was it?
Yeah.

01:08:05.332 --> 01:08:07.877
Reverend Garland said he had
a church outside of Sewanee

01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:11.088
kept getting shot at by
old, no-good white boys...

01:08:11.172 --> 01:08:13.090
uh, the Bushwhackers.

01:08:13.174 --> 01:08:16.301
Say they was stealin' and killin' niggers
left and right.

01:08:16.385 --> 01:08:17.636
Stealin' from white folks, too.

01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:22.099
They was looking for colored soldiers
to help them fight back.

01:08:22.183 --> 01:08:25.019
Old George...
[chuckles]

01:08:25.102 --> 01:08:26.562
he was the first to volunteer.

01:08:26.645 --> 01:08:28.272
Ha.

01:08:30.274 --> 01:08:32.026
You sure this boy
ain't around the bend?

01:08:32.109 --> 01:08:35.154
I reckoned you'd say that.
Reckon I would, too.

01:08:35.237 --> 01:08:36.613
[chuckles]

01:08:36.697 --> 01:08:42.870
Old George told me to bring this back
in case he ain't make it.

01:08:42.953 --> 01:08:44.205
There.

01:08:50.627 --> 01:08:54.590
I miss old Chicken George,
his Africa stories.

01:08:54.673 --> 01:08:57.051
[chuckles] Yeah.

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:05.643
Bring him back to me.

01:09:09.729 --> 01:09:11.249
I'm coming with you, Tom,
to find Daddy.

01:09:11.273 --> 01:09:15.819
Can't, James.
You watch over mama.

01:09:24.161 --> 01:09:28.791
[birds chirping]

01:09:54.191 --> 01:09:56.235
Hey, boy. Hey.

01:09:56.318 --> 01:09:59.905
You know Reverend Garland
in Sewanee?

01:09:59.989 --> 01:10:02.157
My Daddy called Chicken George.

01:10:02.241 --> 01:10:05.202
Chicken George.
Did you ever hear of him?

01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:09.665
H-hey.

01:10:13.711 --> 01:10:15.504
Hey.

01:10:15.588 --> 01:10:17.756
Hey!
Hey, hold up now!

01:10:30.477 --> 01:10:31.979
[horse whinnies]

01:10:34.023 --> 01:10:36.358
[indistinct conversations]

01:10:45.075 --> 01:10:47.578
Rev. Garland: As soon as you load up,
move out. Don't wait.

01:10:47.661 --> 01:10:49.741
Them Bushwhackers gone for now.
They gonna come back.

01:10:49.788 --> 01:10:52.333
Quickly.
Let's go.

01:10:52.416 --> 01:10:54.668
Do not stop until we get
to Henning, Tennessee.

01:10:57.880 --> 01:10:59.882
I'll meet you all there.

01:10:59.965 --> 01:11:02.009
Godspeed.

01:11:02.092 --> 01:11:05.095
[indistinct
conversations continue]

01:11:05.179 --> 01:11:07.014
Let's load it up.

01:11:14.313 --> 01:11:16.857
Daddy?

01:11:16.941 --> 01:11:19.193
[indistinct
conversations continue]

01:11:23.656 --> 01:11:25.532
Daddy, it's Tom.

01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:33.582
[chuckles]

01:11:33.666 --> 01:11:35.793
It really is you.

01:11:35.876 --> 01:11:38.379
Thought I was having
another dream.

01:11:38.462 --> 01:11:40.381
Cyrus said you had a rough go.

01:11:42.299 --> 01:11:44.760
It's time to come home now.

01:11:44.843 --> 01:11:46.512
You need to get on your feet,
move out.

01:11:46.595 --> 01:11:48.013
Not safe here.

01:11:48.097 --> 01:11:50.557
I'm not coming with you.

01:11:50.641 --> 01:11:55.229
I'm going home... Carolina...
with my son.

01:11:55.312 --> 01:11:57.606
I understand.

01:11:57.690 --> 01:12:00.067
You've done more than enough
for us, George,

01:12:00.150 --> 01:12:02.277
chasing off those Bushwhackers.

01:12:02.361 --> 01:12:04.613
You saved our lives.

01:12:04.697 --> 01:12:06.407
The war might be over,

01:12:06.490 --> 01:12:09.034
but some white men
ain't never gonna let it go...

01:12:09.118 --> 01:12:12.204
ain't never gonna accept us being free.

01:12:12.329 --> 01:12:14.456
I do know one thing...

01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:17.543
the Lord don't take
no steps backwards.

01:12:17.626 --> 01:12:20.379
And we ain't giving up
our freedom.

01:12:20.462 --> 01:12:23.090
Henning...
own some land there.

01:12:23.173 --> 01:12:24.842
Gonna make it safe
for our people.

01:12:24.925 --> 01:12:26.927
God's watching over you.

01:12:27.011 --> 01:12:29.263
- Let's move out.
- Get a move on, Daddy.

01:12:29.346 --> 01:12:31.140
Come on, now, boys.
We going home.

01:12:31.223 --> 01:12:33.225
[groans]

01:12:34.768 --> 01:12:36.687
How'd you find me, boy?

01:12:36.770 --> 01:12:39.481
A boy brought me to you.

01:12:39.565 --> 01:12:43.193
Dressed in this blue cloth
on his body and his head.

01:12:43.277 --> 01:12:45.029
Brought me straight to you.

01:12:45.112 --> 01:12:47.448
- Blue cloth on his head.
- Mm-hmm?

01:12:47.531 --> 01:12:50.617
Ain't got no boy like that here.

01:12:50.701 --> 01:12:53.287
Well, hey.

01:12:53.370 --> 01:12:56.665
I thought you might
be needing this.

01:12:56.749 --> 01:12:58.751
[chuckles]

01:13:02.296 --> 01:13:04.465
You're a good boy.

01:13:12.264 --> 01:13:13.515
[gunshot]

01:13:13.599 --> 01:13:15.059
Come on, Daddy.

01:13:15.142 --> 01:13:16.393
Come on, let's go.

01:13:16.477 --> 01:13:18.395
Hurry up.
Come on.

01:13:18.479 --> 01:13:20.439
This way, this way.

01:13:20.522 --> 01:13:22.024
- Come on.
- Get over there.

01:13:22.107 --> 01:13:24.401
[indistinct chattering]

01:13:35.496 --> 01:13:36.955
Bushwhacker:
Move up, move up!

01:13:38.999 --> 01:13:40.417
Come on, Daddy, let's go!

01:13:40.501 --> 01:13:42.586
Come on.
Keep it moving, Daddy.

01:13:42.669 --> 01:13:45.422
[gunfire continues]

01:13:45.506 --> 01:13:47.091
Go, go.
Get up.

01:13:47.174 --> 01:13:49.635
[groaning]

01:13:56.725 --> 01:13:57.846
Tom:
We make that Union line,

01:13:57.893 --> 01:13:59.561
them Bushwhackers
won't follow us.

01:13:59.645 --> 01:14:02.940
We almost there.
Just keep moving.

01:14:03.023 --> 01:14:04.566
Bushwhacker: Run, boy.

01:14:11.907 --> 01:14:13.787
Union soldier: Got Bushwhackers
up on the ridge!

01:14:15.035 --> 01:14:17.329
Turn right back.
You ain't welcome here.

01:14:17.454 --> 01:14:19.164
What?
Y'all heard them shots.

01:14:19.248 --> 01:14:21.375
Got Bushwhackers behind us.
Killed some of us already.

01:14:21.458 --> 01:14:22.918
- Come on.
- That's not our trouble.

01:14:23.001 --> 01:14:24.641
Not since President Lincoln
got shot dead.

01:14:24.711 --> 01:14:26.004
What?

01:14:26.088 --> 01:14:29.049
Some Southern traitor put a bullet
in poor old Abe's head.

01:14:29.133 --> 01:14:30.467
Now I'm tired of you people.

01:14:30.551 --> 01:14:32.427
Ain't enough
we already fought for you.

01:14:32.511 --> 01:14:34.221
Now, we truly sorry
about Mr. Lincoln, sir,

01:14:34.304 --> 01:14:36.282
- but we got Bushwhackers...
- This is a military camp.

01:14:36.306 --> 01:14:37.599
We don't have stuff
for niggers.

01:14:37.683 --> 01:14:39.393
- Get out of here!
- Stop.

01:14:39.476 --> 01:14:41.019
Tom: This man
is Memphis Battery!

01:14:41.103 --> 01:14:43.105
Fought at Fort Pillow!

01:14:43.188 --> 01:14:44.815
Look at his damn uniform!

01:14:44.898 --> 01:14:47.776
A uniform don't make a soldier.
Not to me.

01:14:47.860 --> 01:14:49.570
We've given our blood
for you people.

01:14:49.653 --> 01:14:51.655
- Oh, what about our blood?
- Tell him, corporal.

01:14:51.738 --> 01:14:53.949
What about the blood we gave
for this country?

01:14:54.032 --> 01:14:56.243
- For years!
- Easy now.

01:14:58.745 --> 01:15:00.706
He got every right to be here!

01:15:00.789 --> 01:15:04.042
[indistinct shouting]

01:15:04.126 --> 01:15:05.794
George: Hey, hold on.

01:15:05.878 --> 01:15:08.005
Hold on just
one cotton-picking second!

01:15:08.088 --> 01:15:09.798
[shouting stops]

01:15:09.882 --> 01:15:12.426
Y'all... y'all don't know
who you got there.

01:15:12.509 --> 01:15:14.720
That right there...

01:15:14.803 --> 01:15:17.139
it's best damn blacksmith
in the whole damn Union.

01:15:17.222 --> 01:15:19.933
That's who he is.

01:15:20.017 --> 01:15:24.771
Let me tell you now, that boy...
he got rare, mystical skills,

01:15:24.855 --> 01:15:27.774
passed down
by Mandinka craftsmen.

01:15:27.858 --> 01:15:30.777
That's on the Kamby Bolongo
in Africa.

01:15:30.861 --> 01:15:33.113
One time, I saw him patch a cannon

01:15:33.197 --> 01:15:36.283
by sitting on the muzzle
and hammering it as it fired!

01:15:36.366 --> 01:15:37.993
- [laughter]
- When that hammer broke,

01:15:38.076 --> 01:15:40.245
he just carried on pounding it
with his fists!

01:15:40.329 --> 01:15:42.873
Look at him...
arms like cannonballs!

01:15:42.956 --> 01:15:45.751
Yes, sir, he can fix a rifle,

01:15:45.834 --> 01:15:48.545
mend a saddle,
patch pots and pans.

01:15:48.629 --> 01:15:52.382
That boy can smooth a knot
from a twisted axle

01:15:52.466 --> 01:15:55.177
like a pretty girl pull tangles
from her hair.

01:15:55.260 --> 01:15:57.071
- [laughter]
- And y'all want to chase him off?

01:15:57.095 --> 01:15:58.096
Come on, now.

01:15:58.180 --> 01:16:00.807
You'll be the first soldier boys
home sitting up in your own bed,

01:16:00.891 --> 01:16:02.726
eating on your mama's home
cooking.

01:16:02.809 --> 01:16:04.937
Who wants to smell mama's
gravy right now? Amen!

01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:06.480
Together: Amen!

01:16:06.563 --> 01:16:10.776
If that boy can shoe horses,
we can use him.

01:16:10.859 --> 01:16:12.903
Let them all in.

01:16:12.986 --> 01:16:15.822
[indistinct chattering]

01:16:15.906 --> 01:16:17.546
Officer: Everybody fall out.
Back to work.

01:16:17.616 --> 01:16:19.493
Come on, now.

01:16:19.576 --> 01:16:21.870
Officer 2: Y'all get a little
something to eat.

01:16:21.954 --> 01:16:27.376
# I fear, I fear,
my mother, dear #

01:16:28.377 --> 01:16:33.674
# I fear I've come to harm #

01:16:33.757 --> 01:16:37.302
# No more to see her lovely face... #

01:16:37.386 --> 01:16:41.848
Now, I... I could be wrong.

01:16:41.932 --> 01:16:46.478
I got a notion about that boy
who brought you to me.

01:16:46.603 --> 01:16:51.942
Suppose you gonna tell me
he was a Mandinka spirit?

01:16:52.025 --> 01:16:54.611
Nope.

01:16:54.695 --> 01:16:56.822
Gonna tell you he was Kunta
Kinte hisself,

01:16:56.905 --> 01:16:58.615
same as came to my mama.

01:16:58.699 --> 01:17:02.494
- # By the old barn gate #
- [chuckles]

01:17:02.619 --> 01:17:07.249
# My soul will pass you by #

01:17:19.845 --> 01:17:23.098
I know you ain't over there thinking
I can't do this by myself, is you?

01:17:23.181 --> 01:17:25.475
No, sir.
I think that'd be kind of risky.

01:17:25.559 --> 01:17:28.687
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[chuckles]

01:17:28.770 --> 01:17:30.647
- "A"?
- Mm-hmm.

01:17:30.731 --> 01:17:33.275
- "B"?
- Yeah.

01:17:33.358 --> 01:17:34.651
Boy: "C"?

01:17:37.738 --> 01:17:40.115
[indistinct conversations]

01:17:57.090 --> 01:17:58.342
Oh.

01:18:02.679 --> 01:18:04.681
Jesus.

01:18:09.478 --> 01:18:11.229
George.

01:18:11.313 --> 01:18:13.023
George!

01:18:15.567 --> 01:18:18.111
[laughs] George!

01:18:20.030 --> 01:18:22.824
Hey, Tom.
[laughs]

01:18:23.825 --> 01:18:25.827
How you doing?

01:18:25.911 --> 01:18:29.081
George. Oh.

01:18:30.832 --> 01:18:34.378
You're a sight for sore eyes.
[laughs]

01:18:36.963 --> 01:18:40.008
Old Chicken George.

01:18:40.092 --> 01:18:43.011
About goddamn time
you made it here, old man.

01:18:43.095 --> 01:18:44.989
I'm giving you a chance to learn
how to work a field.

01:18:45.013 --> 01:18:46.848
- Oh, will you now?
- [laughter]

01:18:46.932 --> 01:18:49.351
Cyrus: Stand him.
Stand him up right.

01:18:49.434 --> 01:18:50.811
Oh, hang on.

01:18:50.894 --> 01:18:53.146
[wincing]

01:18:53.230 --> 01:18:55.023
Oh, that... that was nothing.

01:18:55.107 --> 01:18:56.650
Took out 20 men.

01:18:56.733 --> 01:18:58.860
Neither one of us
got a scratch on us.

01:18:58.944 --> 01:19:00.070
[laughter]

01:19:04.741 --> 01:19:07.202
Tom: Mr. Murray, we all leaving.

01:19:07.285 --> 01:19:08.971
Well, surely, we can
work out something, Tom.

01:19:08.995 --> 01:19:11.790
A-an extra chicken or two,
if... if that helps.

01:19:11.873 --> 01:19:14.751
Thank you, sir,
but Henning, Tennessee,

01:19:14.835 --> 01:19:16.670
is gonna have shops run
by our own people.

01:19:16.753 --> 01:19:19.423
Not that we won't take money
from the white folk.

01:19:19.506 --> 01:19:21.550
Money ain't got no color.

01:19:21.633 --> 01:19:24.261
Tom, I don't know if
you'll take my words to heart,

01:19:24.344 --> 01:19:27.848
but I wish you
and your family good fortune.

01:19:27.931 --> 01:19:32.769
There was a time when we were
working together, I felt...

01:19:36.148 --> 01:19:38.900
Well... Godspeed.

01:19:44.156 --> 01:19:46.491
You niggers
ain't going nowhere.

01:19:46.575 --> 01:19:48.577
- Frederick.
- You got to pay 'fore you leave.

01:19:48.660 --> 01:19:52.831
Don't have to ask you, Frederick.
Talking to your daddy.

01:19:52.914 --> 01:19:54.267
I told you I would handle this, Frederick.

01:19:54.291 --> 01:19:56.001
- My daddy's a fool.
- Son.

01:19:56.084 --> 01:19:58.920
I want every penny you earned
on this farm as a blacksmith.

01:19:59.004 --> 01:20:00.881
Made a lot more money
for this farm.

01:20:00.964 --> 01:20:02.674
Goodbye, sir.

01:20:02.799 --> 01:20:04.426
Son, son!

01:20:04.509 --> 01:20:06.178
You think anything's changed

01:20:06.261 --> 01:20:08.263
- 'cause the war's over?
- Frederick, please.

01:20:08.346 --> 01:20:10.265
Them Union boys
gonna be home soon enough,

01:20:10.348 --> 01:20:14.102
but I'll still be right here,
and plenty of men just like me.

01:20:14.186 --> 01:20:18.565
We will redeem this country and put
you people back where you belong.

01:20:18.648 --> 01:20:21.818
It's just natural law.

01:20:21.902 --> 01:20:25.197
I won't never see a nigger
be my equal.

01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:29.284
Don't have no interest
in being your equal, Frederick.

01:20:31.036 --> 01:20:34.372
Charlotte: No, no!

01:20:34.456 --> 01:20:37.125
F-Frederick!
Oh, my God!

01:20:40.086 --> 01:20:41.755
[crying]

01:20:41.838 --> 01:20:44.174
[panting]

01:20:46.468 --> 01:20:49.054
First good thing
my Daddy ever did for me.

01:20:52.140 --> 01:20:53.975
- Yeah, we're ready.
- All right, baby.

01:20:54.059 --> 01:20:56.228
Li'l Kizzy:
Are you guys ready?

01:20:56.311 --> 01:20:57.622
All right, let's get the kids in there.

01:20:57.646 --> 01:21:00.190
[laughs]
[indistinct conversations]

01:21:37.811 --> 01:21:39.062
[baby coos]

01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:48.363
Well, Chicken George, I reckon
it's time I be moving on.

01:21:48.446 --> 01:21:51.157
I thank you kindly
for everything,

01:21:51.241 --> 01:21:54.369
and you...
you're all nice folks.

01:21:54.452 --> 01:21:58.164
But after all, you...
you's all family.

01:21:58.248 --> 01:21:59.583
And you're not my family.

01:22:02.752 --> 01:22:07.007
We are now,
if you want us to be.

01:22:09.759 --> 01:22:12.178
Hmm.

01:22:12.262 --> 01:22:16.016
Well, that doesn't sound
so bad, now does it?

01:22:16.099 --> 01:22:19.853
Not bad at all.

01:22:19.936 --> 01:22:22.105
- Can I come in?
- Mm-hmm.

01:22:25.442 --> 01:22:27.152
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:22:27.235 --> 01:22:29.821
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:22:29.946 --> 01:22:33.033
Yeah, she gonna be a strong one,
just like my mama.

01:22:33.116 --> 01:22:34.826
Mm-hmm.

01:22:34.951 --> 01:22:38.038
You are so beautiful.

01:22:38.121 --> 01:22:40.665
Irene, give me the baby?

01:22:40.749 --> 01:22:44.085
- Tom, what's wrong?
- Matilda: It's all right.

01:22:55.972 --> 01:22:57.390
Tom.

01:22:57.474 --> 01:22:59.017
Get back.

01:23:02.979 --> 01:23:05.357
[breathing heavily]

01:23:10.612 --> 01:23:13.281
W-what do I do, Daddy?

01:23:16.159 --> 01:23:19.287
Tell me now.
What...

01:23:19.371 --> 01:23:21.998
How do they... how do I...

01:23:23.249 --> 01:23:26.711
...give her
her name the right way?

01:23:26.795 --> 01:23:28.797
Son, I can't...

01:23:30.757 --> 01:23:33.426
I can't say I know for sure.

01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:36.930
Just talk to her.

01:23:39.265 --> 01:23:43.186
I don't know any Africa words.

01:23:43.269 --> 01:23:46.314
I don't know if this
is the right time,

01:23:46.398 --> 01:23:50.860
or I don't know if the sky looks
the way it's supposed to be, but...

01:23:53.697 --> 01:23:59.619
I know you my first baby
not born a slave.

01:24:01.287 --> 01:24:03.873
First baby nobody can own.

01:24:05.041 --> 01:24:08.044
But that don't mean
you don't have to be a warrior.

01:24:08.128 --> 01:24:10.714
Still gonna have
to fight to stay free.

01:24:12.507 --> 01:24:15.468
Every day.

01:24:15.552 --> 01:24:19.055
Always gonna be someone wants
to take away your freedom.

01:24:21.391 --> 01:24:24.269
And I can't keep
this family together

01:24:24.352 --> 01:24:28.648
if I don't teach you
where we come from,

01:24:28.732 --> 01:24:30.734
who we are...

01:24:33.862 --> 01:24:36.489
...if I don't remember
who I am.

01:24:40.577 --> 01:24:42.871
So that's why I got
to tell you this story.

01:24:44.456 --> 01:24:46.916
So I can be the father
I want to be.

01:25:01.097 --> 01:25:04.434
Alex:
His name was Kunta Kinte,

01:25:04.517 --> 01:25:07.353
son of Omoro and Binta Kinte,

01:25:07.437 --> 01:25:13.526
from Juffure, in the kingdom of Niumi
on the Kamby Bolongo.

01:25:13.610 --> 01:25:15.570
Flying home from The Gambia,

01:25:15.653 --> 01:25:19.073
I knew I had to write
a book about him.

01:25:19.157 --> 01:25:22.577
My ancestors would be a symbol
for millions of slaves,

01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:26.956
all of them seeds of American
families living today,

01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:30.502
captured, chained,
sailed across the same ocean

01:25:30.585 --> 01:25:33.713
in ships
where untold numbers died.

01:25:33.797 --> 01:25:36.674
Sold to thousands
of plantations,

01:25:36.758 --> 01:25:41.095
millions of men and women
who struggled to survive

01:25:41.179 --> 01:25:44.182
and fought to be free every day.

01:27:09.475 --> 01:27:11.477
[man vocalizing]

01:27:18.818 --> 01:27:21.154
Alex: The truth can never be known.

01:27:21.237 --> 01:27:23.907
It can only be told in a story.

01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:27.535
There once was a boy who
was taken from his family

01:27:27.619 --> 01:27:30.204
and carried halfway
around the world.

01:27:30.288 --> 01:27:32.790
He lived to start a new family.

01:27:32.874 --> 01:27:36.419
And in his journey, he became
a hero for a new nation.

01:27:36.502 --> 01:27:38.129
I hope my story honors him,

01:27:39.172 --> 01:27:43.635
brings peace
and pride to us all.

01:28:00.652 --> 01:28:04.489
[choir vocalizing]

01:28:10.620 --> 01:28:13.498
# And when the door closes #

01:28:13.581 --> 01:28:16.501
# Another one opens #

01:28:16.584 --> 01:28:18.503
# I walk through it #

01:28:18.586 --> 01:28:21.547
# With my head up #

01:28:21.631 --> 01:28:24.592
# At the end of a desert #

01:28:24.676 --> 01:28:27.595
# There's always an ocean #

01:28:27.679 --> 01:28:30.556
# And when the night fades away #

01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:33.101
# The sun comes up #

01:28:33.184 --> 01:28:36.604
# New beginning #

01:28:36.688 --> 01:28:41.526
# Oh, it's just a new beginning #

01:28:41.609 --> 01:28:43.820
# Oh... #

01:28:45.571 --> 01:28:47.365
[song ends]
