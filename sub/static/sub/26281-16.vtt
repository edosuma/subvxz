00:34.907 --> 00:36.842
Today is not Saturday.

00:36.876 --> 00:38.711
Why did you make me pancakes?

00:38.744 --> 00:40.947
They are fresh start pancakes.

00:40.981 --> 00:43.383
Like the first day
of school every year

00:43.416 --> 00:45.385
when you get to wear
a brand-new outfit.

00:47.620 --> 00:49.822
Well, not everyone
wore a new outfit.

00:49.855 --> 00:51.391
But the rule in this house

00:51.424 --> 00:53.859
is that when you start
a new life event,

00:53.893 --> 00:55.161
you get pancakes.

00:55.195 --> 00:59.365
I don't want a fresh start.

00:59.399 --> 01:01.234
I want to stay in surgery.

01:03.403 --> 01:04.604
I know.

01:04.637 --> 01:08.708
And I am really proud of you
for handling it all so...

01:19.485 --> 01:21.387
Doctors, please give me
one more minute.

01:22.288 --> 01:24.290
We have an associate pastor
at the church,

01:24.324 --> 01:26.826
but Clarence
likes to write the sermons.

01:28.128 --> 01:29.262
- Sorry.
- Please.

01:29.295 --> 01:30.796
Although this is important too.

01:31.831 --> 01:33.766
The surgery consists
of two steps.

01:33.799 --> 01:36.136
First we fuse the spine
to stabilize it,

01:36.169 --> 01:37.703
and then we remove the tumor.

01:37.737 --> 01:39.905
Because the cancer has spread
to your lymph nodes,

01:39.939 --> 01:41.341
you'll still have
to follow up with chemo.

01:43.609 --> 01:45.945
Clarence, are you in pain?

01:45.978 --> 01:48.581
Quite a bit actually,
but I'm fine.

01:48.614 --> 01:50.316
Well,
since what's causing your pain

01:50.350 --> 01:52.152
is the tumor pushing
against your spine,

01:52.185 --> 01:53.953
the spinal fusion will ease
pressure on your nerves

01:53.986 --> 01:55.155
and should eliminate your pain.

01:55.188 --> 01:58.624
Please, I, uh...
I need this pain.

02:00.193 --> 02:02.662
Can't you just do the second
part and remove the tumor?

02:02.695 --> 02:03.963
If we don't fuse the spine,

02:03.996 --> 02:06.566
it'll make removing the tumor
a lot more difficult.

02:06.599 --> 02:08.300
More difficult,
but it can be done?

02:08.334 --> 02:10.169
It can.
But I recommend against it.

02:10.203 --> 02:12.105
Especially since
there's no reason not to.

02:19.645 --> 02:21.547
I did something

02:23.649 --> 02:24.884
unforgivable.

02:27.019 --> 02:30.090
This pain is my punishment.

02:37.397 --> 02:39.832
Can I ask what you did
that was so bad?

02:43.136 --> 02:44.470
I killed someone.

02:49.790 --> 02:53.880

03:16.436 --> 03:17.570
My sister and I were

03:17.603 --> 03:19.339
coming home from climbing
Mt. Whitney.

03:19.372 --> 03:21.073
We're doing the State 50 climbs.

03:21.107 --> 03:22.608
The numbness started
during the climb?

03:23.443 --> 03:25.411
First my hands,
and then my feet.

03:27.079 --> 03:29.149
You have a headache?
Yeah.

03:29.182 --> 03:31.351
High altitude causes headaches.

03:31.384 --> 03:32.685
Dehydration compounds it.

03:32.718 --> 03:35.221
From now on just climb
slower and drink more.

03:39.625 --> 03:40.793
Tell them about the other thing.

03:45.198 --> 03:46.599
Before leaving for the mountain,

03:46.632 --> 03:50.836
I had this
weird sensation like...

03:50.870 --> 03:51.937
Dread.

03:51.971 --> 03:53.739
I couldn't shake it.

03:55.908 --> 03:59.545
Well, when people describe a sense of
impending doom, it's usually anxiety.

03:59.579 --> 04:01.614
No, it was like a premonition,

04:04.484 --> 04:06.252
that I was going to die.

04:09.289 --> 04:11.791
I'm sure it was...
Dr. Park will run a brain scan,

04:11.824 --> 04:13.058
and we'll do some lab work.

05:02.041 --> 05:03.042
Shaun.

05:04.109 --> 05:06.011
Hello, Dr. Lever.

05:06.045 --> 05:07.913
Carly is fine.

05:07.947 --> 05:09.349
Welcome to pathology.

05:12.385 --> 05:14.820
It is going to be great
working with you.

05:21.461 --> 05:23.229
What do you think?

05:25.298 --> 05:27.933
I know it's a lot to take in.

05:27.967 --> 05:30.336
It's kind of like your first
time at Disneyland, right?

05:30.370 --> 05:32.405
I've never been to Disneyland.

05:35.741 --> 05:37.477
Let me give you a tour.

05:37.510 --> 05:39.812
Cytopathology, forensics,

05:39.845 --> 05:42.282
genomics, microbiology.

05:42.315 --> 05:44.450
We get to identify organisms,

05:44.484 --> 05:47.019
interpret cell morphology,

05:47.052 --> 05:48.654
sequence genes.

05:50.856 --> 05:53.058
Is that a D300e

05:53.092 --> 05:55.595
pathogen antibacterial
bioprinter?

05:56.195 --> 05:57.397
It's new.

05:57.430 --> 06:00.733
You're working on
antibiotic resistance

06:00.766 --> 06:02.802
in emerging microorganisms?

06:02.835 --> 06:04.737
It's "we" now, Shaun.

06:04.770 --> 06:05.871
Yes, we are.

06:08.508 --> 06:09.742
Do you want to play with it?

06:11.544 --> 06:13.313
Very much.

06:13.346 --> 06:14.814
Go ahead.

06:14.847 --> 06:16.582
It's kind of your job now.

06:21.354 --> 06:23.556
We are the detectives.

06:23.589 --> 06:25.925
Surgeons are just the beat cops.

06:32.298 --> 06:34.767
Our best bet is to try
to separate the tumor

06:34.800 --> 06:37.069
from his cord,
and then resect it.

06:37.102 --> 06:38.704
Okay, this is insane.

06:38.738 --> 06:40.172
You know how
he "killed" a person?

06:40.205 --> 06:43.108
He was counseling a parishioner
who committed suicide.

06:43.142 --> 06:44.377
That must have been traumatic.

06:44.410 --> 06:47.279
Traumatic, yes.
Murder, no.

06:47.313 --> 06:49.515
Hey, I know it's stupid,
but he has autonomy.

06:49.549 --> 06:51.384
I didn't stay stupid.
I said "insane."

06:51.417 --> 06:54.520
You want to override his
wishes because he's religious?

06:54.554 --> 06:57.022
Something like 90% of
Americans believe in God.

06:57.056 --> 07:00.360
I'm one of them.
Are we all mentally impaired?

07:00.393 --> 07:02.127
Should you ignore us all
if you don't like our choices?

07:02.161 --> 07:04.597
Only those getting divine
messages from their tumors.

07:04.630 --> 07:06.366
He's not crazy.
Okay, you're right.

07:06.399 --> 07:09.369
He is just stupid.
But don't we have a duty to educate him?

07:09.402 --> 07:12.137
You're gonna talk him
out of his religion? No.

07:12.171 --> 07:15.608
You told him the surgery
was more dangerous this way.

07:15.641 --> 07:18.344
I don't think he appreciated
how much more dangerous.

07:20.580 --> 07:22.582
Good idea.

07:22.615 --> 07:24.950
He thinks he'll go to hell if
he dies before he's forgiven.

07:25.985 --> 07:27.620
Make sure he knows
it can happen on the table.

07:35.495 --> 07:37.397
An MRI for anxiety?

07:37.430 --> 07:38.998
It does fly in the face of reducing

07:39.031 --> 07:40.466
unnecessary medical tests.

07:41.667 --> 07:45.605
When I was a resident,
I had a patient come through the ER.

07:45.638 --> 07:47.072
Female.
35 years old.

07:47.106 --> 07:49.108
Slight cough.
Slightly hypothyroid.

07:49.141 --> 07:51.110
Normal vitals.

07:51.143 --> 07:54.246
I labeled her a whiner
because she kept insisting,

07:54.279 --> 07:56.148
"I'm gonna die."

07:56.181 --> 07:57.750
I sent her home.

07:57.783 --> 07:59.118
And she died?

07:59.151 --> 08:01.320
No. She kept
coming back.

08:01.353 --> 08:04.590
Over and over again.

08:04.624 --> 08:07.627
We do this test,
we prove there's nothing wrong with her,

08:07.660 --> 08:09.194
we send her home reassured.

08:18.638 --> 08:19.805
Damn.

08:22.763 --> 08:25.265
The MRI showed
a high grade meningioma.

08:25.298 --> 08:28.301
An advanced tumor that grows in the
tissue layers that cover the brain.

08:29.670 --> 08:33.339
Its features are consistent
with it being malignant.

08:37.309 --> 08:39.511
These tumors
tend to be aggressive

08:39.546 --> 08:42.015
and impossible to fully resect.

08:43.515 --> 08:45.351
Um, so what...
What can you do?

08:46.687 --> 08:48.354
Palliative care,

08:48.388 --> 08:50.456
symptom control
with medications.

09:05.505 --> 09:07.040
You're risking spinal damage,

09:07.073 --> 09:09.409
paralysis, death.

09:09.442 --> 09:13.313
If that's what God chooses,
then that is his will.

09:13.346 --> 09:16.683
If you have cancer because
he wants you to have cancer,

09:16.717 --> 09:18.885
why are you here?
Getting treatment?

09:18.919 --> 09:20.854
I'm here because
I believe in science.

09:22.555 --> 09:25.892
I am who I am
because I believe in God.

09:27.694 --> 09:30.664
So do you think all people who
are sick are being punished?

09:32.398 --> 09:35.101
I mean, we have an eight-year-old
down the hall with bone cancer.

09:36.269 --> 09:38.538
You want to go tell her
God hates her?

09:38.571 --> 09:42.008
I'm sure that girl is not
suffering as a punishment.

09:42.042 --> 09:45.411
She's suffering so others
may have a chance

09:45.445 --> 09:47.714
to show her mercy,

09:47.748 --> 09:49.950
to show her compassion,
so she can inspire.

09:52.252 --> 09:54.655
I don't know His plan, but I know
it's not as simple as you would...

09:54.688 --> 09:56.857
No.
No, it's not simple.

09:58.391 --> 09:59.926
Except for your pain.

10:09.269 --> 10:10.370
His name was Michael.

10:18.078 --> 10:20.213
His wife found his body.

10:20.246 --> 10:22.048
You had no idea.

10:22.082 --> 10:24.050
I knew he was depressed.

10:24.084 --> 10:25.719
But you thought
he was getting better.

10:28.588 --> 10:31.124
I didn't take his call.

10:31.157 --> 10:33.126
Because I was having a drink.

10:36.096 --> 10:39.800
It'd been a long day
dealing with the renovations,

10:39.833 --> 10:41.802
and I was having a damn drink.

10:50.844 --> 10:51.845
Hey, Shaun.

10:52.412 --> 10:53.980
Hey, Carly.

10:54.014 --> 10:56.549
I started Sadie Barnes
on anti-seizure medication,

10:56.582 --> 10:59.119
need you to run
a peak phenytoin level.

10:59.152 --> 11:01.054
The couriers must be happy
that the surgeons

11:01.087 --> 11:03.089
are doing their own
specimen deliveries.

11:05.992 --> 11:07.127
How you doing down here?

11:09.629 --> 11:13.099
Carly says pathologists
are the detectives,

11:13.133 --> 11:14.835
surgeons are just the beat cops.

11:21.641 --> 11:24.110
Shaun, are you happy here?

11:24.144 --> 11:26.412
When did you give the patient
her loading dose?

11:26.446 --> 11:28.181
One hour ago.
Hmm.

11:29.015 --> 11:31.885
Shaun, if you're happy,
that's great.

11:31.918 --> 11:33.653
But if you're not,

11:33.686 --> 11:35.221
you have to tell Han
how you feel.

11:35.989 --> 11:37.357
You need to show him you care

11:37.390 --> 11:38.859
and that you believe
in yourself.

11:44.965 --> 11:46.800
Do you need this done STAT?

11:46.833 --> 11:48.935
No.
She's asymptomatic.

11:48.969 --> 11:50.536
It's just for seizure prevention.
Good.

11:50.570 --> 11:52.138
Carly says that in pathology

11:52.172 --> 11:53.840
you can take a break
whenever you want.

11:53.874 --> 11:56.042
I want to take a break now.
I'm going for a walk.

12:02.382 --> 12:03.683
He shouldn't be in pathology.

12:03.716 --> 12:06.319
He's a good surgical resident.
You're right.

12:06.352 --> 12:07.954
Then you'll move him back? No.

12:07.988 --> 12:10.023
You're wrong about that part.
He should be in pathology.

12:10.056 --> 12:11.925
But he was a good surgical resident.
Then why...

12:11.958 --> 12:14.828
Because he'll never
be a good surgeon.

12:14.861 --> 12:16.196
How do you think
he'll do in three years

12:16.229 --> 12:17.563
when no one's looking
over his shoulder?

12:18.664 --> 12:20.901
When he's looking over
someone else's shoulder?

12:20.934 --> 12:23.703
Supervising new residents,
leading grand rounds,

12:23.736 --> 12:25.872
advocating for
vulnerable patients.

12:25.906 --> 12:28.108
Do you see him doing any of
that without a safety net?

12:30.676 --> 12:32.846
We can help him get there.

12:32.879 --> 12:34.480
Just because he wants
to be a surgeon,

12:34.514 --> 12:35.882
just because you want
him to be a surgeon,

12:35.916 --> 12:38.084
doesn't mean he gets to have
that dream come true.

12:39.920 --> 12:41.587
Has it occurred to you
that maybe

12:41.621 --> 12:43.189
we know Shaun
better than you do?

12:44.257 --> 12:45.992
Has it occurred to you that

12:46.026 --> 12:47.861
that might be your problem?

12:47.894 --> 12:50.897
That your view of him might be
distorted because you like him?

12:50.931 --> 12:54.100
Has it occurred to you that maybe
he's better off in pathology?

12:54.134 --> 12:55.969
That maybe he'll even like it?

12:56.636 --> 12:57.770
Do you care?

12:58.771 --> 12:59.873
I thought you might.

13:05.445 --> 13:08.081
We need better ventral exposure.

13:08.114 --> 13:09.983
Drill off more of the
pedicle and vertebral body.

13:12.152 --> 13:13.553
Ligate the exiting nerve root.

13:13.586 --> 13:15.288
We'll take it with the tumor
for a wider margin.

13:20.760 --> 13:22.128
I can't see it.

13:22.162 --> 13:24.264
The tumor's causing the spinal
cord to be bowed up to us.

13:27.934 --> 13:31.037
We need more exposure to get
around and in front of it.

13:31.071 --> 13:33.306
The vertebrae is
too fragmented and displaced.

13:33.339 --> 13:36.309
We can't get a complete
resection without stabilization.

13:36.342 --> 13:38.044
He's tanking.

13:38.078 --> 13:40.413
Probably spinal shock from tension
on the cord. We need to abort.

13:45.986 --> 13:48.454
All right, on three.
One, two, three.

13:49.595 --> 13:50.862
You fixed me!

13:51.930 --> 13:54.066
No, no.
What happened to my pain?

13:54.100 --> 13:57.903
Stop!
We didn't fix you.

13:57.936 --> 14:00.939
There was a complication.
We injected anesthetic.

14:02.274 --> 14:03.442
It'll wear off.

14:03.475 --> 14:04.943
We had to stop the surgery

14:04.977 --> 14:06.578
before we could
remove the tumor.

14:06.612 --> 14:08.780
You went into shock.

14:08.814 --> 14:12.251
We lost your heart rate
and blood pressure.

14:12.284 --> 14:15.587
We warned it would be a trickier
surgery without the fusion.

14:15.621 --> 14:18.257
Nothing has changed.
The anesthetic will wear off,

14:18.290 --> 14:20.792
the pain will come back,
but worse.

14:20.826 --> 14:22.428
When can you try again?

14:22.461 --> 14:25.231
Try again?
We failed.

14:26.665 --> 14:28.867
There is no reason
to think we will succeed

14:28.900 --> 14:30.202
next time unless
we do the fusion...

14:30.236 --> 14:33.705
But you know what the issues are,
you learned... Why haven't you?

14:37.843 --> 14:40.012
Do think God wants you to die?

14:47.419 --> 14:48.654
Please.

14:50.089 --> 14:51.323
Try again.

14:55.494 --> 14:57.463
Cyanide poisoning.

14:59.665 --> 15:01.700
The cause of death
on the Atlin case.

15:04.936 --> 15:06.472
You know how I found it?

15:06.505 --> 15:09.608
I smelled it.
Almonds.

15:15.981 --> 15:18.450
Dr. Park's patient.

15:18.484 --> 15:20.986
I flagged her eosinophil count.

15:21.019 --> 15:22.788
It doesn't match up
with the diagnosis

15:22.821 --> 15:25.357
of advanced meningioma
listed on the requisition.

15:25.391 --> 15:27.993
Great. Nice work.

15:28.894 --> 15:31.297
I'm going to talk
to Dr. Lim about it.

15:31.330 --> 15:32.564
Whoa there, Shaun.
Hold up.

15:32.598 --> 15:34.800
You don't need to do that.

15:34.833 --> 15:37.703
The attendings are on the lookout
for the flags. They'll run with it.

15:37.736 --> 15:40.038
I want to run with it.

15:40.072 --> 15:42.341
You've been on the receiving
end. You know how it works.

15:42.374 --> 15:45.811
How it works
is I see something abnormal

15:45.844 --> 15:47.813
and then I discuss it
with the team,

15:47.846 --> 15:49.848
and we plan how we'll fix it.

15:49.881 --> 15:51.150
We run with it.

15:52.651 --> 15:56.755
Shaun, once a test is done,
we move on to the next one.

16:00.192 --> 16:03.662
I'd like to take a walk.

16:06.398 --> 16:08.400
Are you going to walk to Dr. Lim

16:08.434 --> 16:09.868
and discuss this case, Shaun?

16:15.441 --> 16:17.676
That's not what we do here.

16:17.709 --> 16:22.581
We investigate, report,
and then we move on.

16:24.616 --> 16:26.385
Are you gonna be able
to do that,

16:26.418 --> 16:27.686
move on?

16:29.054 --> 16:30.522
I don't know.

16:31.423 --> 16:34.560
But I will try very hard.

16:38.730 --> 16:39.898
Next time.

16:49.908 --> 16:50.976
Dr. Browne.

16:51.643 --> 16:52.911
Is this about a patient?

16:53.879 --> 16:54.980
No.

16:56.582 --> 16:57.716
Come in.

17:00.552 --> 17:02.821
I've heard a lot about you.

17:02.854 --> 17:04.556
I'm aware you stood up
to a supervisor.

17:04.589 --> 17:05.957
Is that what's happening now?

17:08.727 --> 17:13.098
Um, I put together
a list of cases

17:13.131 --> 17:16.101
which Dr. Murphy
contributed to.

17:16.134 --> 17:18.103
Uniquely.

17:18.136 --> 17:19.871
You're a loyal friend.

17:19.905 --> 17:22.241
I've specified the ideas he had,

17:22.273 --> 17:25.243
ideas that no one else
around here could have...

17:25.277 --> 17:26.678
Do you think I hate him?

17:28.647 --> 17:29.748
No.

17:34.119 --> 17:36.655
But I think

17:36.688 --> 17:39.825
you might be biased against
him because of his condition.

17:39.858 --> 17:42.328
So he doesn't have communication issues?
I'm wrong about that?

17:42.361 --> 17:45.264
No. But he...
If he had the flu,

17:45.297 --> 17:48.334
I would tell him to stay
home until he got better.

17:48.367 --> 17:50.269
He has autism...

17:50.302 --> 17:52.604
I could tell him to stay home
until he gets better.

17:52.638 --> 17:55.807
Instead I found a place
for him to help us,

17:55.841 --> 17:57.276
to save lives.

17:59.177 --> 18:02.147
And you should know I have rather
mixed feelings about loyalty.

18:29.140 --> 18:31.176
All righty.
There you go.

18:33.312 --> 18:34.313
Hello.

18:35.814 --> 18:37.048
Aaron.

18:38.183 --> 18:39.351
It's good to see you.

18:39.385 --> 18:40.852
Yeah.
The feeling is mutual.

18:42.153 --> 18:43.355
Can I have one of those?

18:45.190 --> 18:46.758
The chocolate chip muffin?
Yes, please.

18:47.393 --> 18:48.827
Special occasion?

18:48.860 --> 18:50.462
Yes.
Yeah?

18:50.496 --> 18:54.232
As of today, I am no longer
injecting toxins into my body.

18:54.266 --> 18:56.702
Except, of course,
with chocolate chips.

18:56.735 --> 19:00.171
Oh, you're done with chemo?
Wow. That's amazing.

19:00.205 --> 19:01.707
Congratulations.
Thank you.

19:02.908 --> 19:05.677
I was thinking of going out
tonight and celebrating

19:05.711 --> 19:08.079
what may be very good news.

19:08.113 --> 19:10.015
If you're free, my treat.

19:10.048 --> 19:11.717
I...
I'm sorry, Aaron.

19:11.750 --> 19:13.184
I have, uh, another commitment.

19:13.218 --> 19:15.020
Oh. Um, tomorrow then?

19:15.053 --> 19:16.522
This week is really crazy.

19:16.555 --> 19:20.091
You know what? I am not doing
chemo every night next week,

19:20.125 --> 19:23.228
so I am free every single
night, so...

19:23.261 --> 19:26.031
Aaron, I'm seeing someone.

19:28.199 --> 19:29.601
I'm sorry.

19:33.872 --> 19:35.574
Nothing to be sorry about.

19:39.411 --> 19:40.779
It was good to see you.

19:50.389 --> 19:53.224
Keep an extra close
eye on blood pressure and heart rate.

19:55.894 --> 19:57.496
I have extra
fluid, vasopressors,

19:57.529 --> 19:58.597
and inotropes ready.

20:01.467 --> 20:02.668
Why no God?

20:05.103 --> 20:06.805
You follow in the tradition
that you're handed.

20:06.838 --> 20:09.274
My family wasn't religious.
We never went to church.

20:09.307 --> 20:10.742
I was there every Sunday.

20:10.776 --> 20:12.644
8:00 a.m.
for Catholic mass.

20:12.678 --> 20:15.714
My parents eventually got tired of
all the rules and turned Lutheran.

20:15.747 --> 20:17.483
They found that dull
and went back to Catholic.

20:17.516 --> 20:19.317
That's my tradition.

20:23.088 --> 20:26.224
What do you think
it'll be like when you die?

20:26.257 --> 20:29.294
Probably like it was before I was born.
A whole lot of nothing.

20:31.363 --> 20:32.364
We're there.

20:33.965 --> 20:36.568
Where we were when everything
went wrong last time.

20:36.602 --> 20:38.970
We need to remove the tumor
without putting any pressure

20:39.004 --> 20:41.373
on his cord at all,
or he'll be back in spinal shock.

20:43.609 --> 20:45.511
And we need more tumor release
from the vertebral body.

20:45.544 --> 20:47.846
Extend your osteotomies
proximal and distal.

20:51.016 --> 20:52.150
Good.

20:54.386 --> 20:56.788
I think I got a free plane...

20:56.822 --> 20:58.457
Retract it from the cord
a little more.

21:03.462 --> 21:04.630
I got it.

21:04.663 --> 21:07.132
Now, when you remove it
careful not to morselize it.

21:10.902 --> 21:12.003
Can you hold that up?

21:14.740 --> 21:15.974
Dr. Reznick,
give me a measurement.

21:18.977 --> 21:20.479
Max length is 4.5.

21:21.346 --> 21:22.548
Get a pre-op scan up.

21:24.750 --> 21:26.585
That says the tumor's
eight centimeters.

21:27.986 --> 21:30.456
How does a tumor shrink
from eight centimeters

21:30.489 --> 21:32.691
to 4.5 without radiation
in two weeks?

21:34.392 --> 21:35.527
It doesn't.

21:40.290 --> 21:42.759
Why the page, Shaun?
And why are you in radiology?

21:42.793 --> 21:44.394
We rely on flags.

21:44.428 --> 21:46.496
You have to count on
the ordering physician

21:46.530 --> 21:49.033
seeing it while you move on
to something else.

21:49.066 --> 21:50.167
Okay. And?

21:50.200 --> 21:52.837
I don't agree with
Sadie Barnes' diagnosis,

21:52.870 --> 21:56.273
and I think her tumor
should be biopsied.

21:56.306 --> 21:59.043
Shaun, I...
Dr. Han wanted me away from patients.

21:59.076 --> 22:00.845
Patients are not allowed
in the viewing room.

22:00.878 --> 22:02.479
So I'm not doing anything wrong.

22:04.414 --> 22:06.951
Two radiologists said

22:06.984 --> 22:08.853
it was a malignant meningioma

22:08.886 --> 22:11.388
in the insular region
and encasing the MCA vessels.

22:11.421 --> 22:12.789
That's exactly where it is.

22:12.823 --> 22:14.558
And her clinical picture
matches perfectly.

22:14.591 --> 22:16.861
Arm and leg numbness.

22:16.894 --> 22:20.865
The tumor attachment to the
dura is slightly anomalous.

22:20.898 --> 22:23.433
And the insular region
is slightly atypical, too.

22:27.972 --> 22:29.974
What differential diagnoses
are you proposing?

22:31.942 --> 22:33.810
I need to speak to the patient.

22:33.844 --> 22:36.113
Should I ask
Dr. Han for permission?

22:36.146 --> 22:37.781
Shaun, I...

22:37.814 --> 22:40.951
...will bring your concern about
the scan to the head of radiology.

22:40.985 --> 22:44.188
But approaching Dr. Han?
Don't do that.

22:46.223 --> 22:48.192
Now, I already talked to him
about your reassignment.

22:48.225 --> 22:50.127
I don't know if it'll make
any difference...

22:50.160 --> 22:54.264
If I were Claire, would you
let me approach Dr. Han

22:54.298 --> 22:55.832
about something
that concerned me?

23:00.037 --> 23:02.106
Yes.
I probably would.

23:03.573 --> 23:06.276
Hmm.

23:06.310 --> 23:10.814
Is that because Claire doesn't make
mistakes when she's communicating?

23:12.149 --> 23:13.617
Yes.

23:15.619 --> 23:19.723
Then do you think Dr. Han made the right
decision by sending me to pathology?

23:22.626 --> 23:24.128
No.

23:36.273 --> 23:38.008
The lymph nodes
have shrunk, too.

23:38.042 --> 23:40.144
This is a PET scan
from two weeks ago.

23:40.177 --> 23:41.946
Enlarged and cancerous.

23:41.979 --> 23:43.380
Today...

23:44.681 --> 23:45.749
...they've all regressed.

23:52.289 --> 23:54.724
Spontaneous regression
has been reported

23:54.758 --> 23:57.361
in melanomas,
renal cell carcinomas,

23:57.394 --> 24:00.030
neuroblastomas, and some
types of blood cancers.

24:00.064 --> 24:02.366
In a sarcoma
that's metastasized?

24:02.399 --> 24:05.535
No. But if it happened
in those others, why not?

24:05.569 --> 24:07.704
Because none of them make sense.

24:07.737 --> 24:09.139
When I read about
disappearing cancer,

24:09.173 --> 24:12.242
I always think some doctor missed
something, forgot something,

24:12.276 --> 24:15.479
screwed up something.

24:15.512 --> 24:18.415
The theory is that
the body somehow triggers

24:18.448 --> 24:20.350
an immune response
against the cancer.

24:20.384 --> 24:22.652
Something somehow lights a fuse.

24:22.686 --> 24:24.754
The theory says the fuse
is lit by an infection.

24:24.788 --> 24:26.856
His lab work proves
he hasn't had one.

24:26.890 --> 24:29.994
At this point, the most
credible explanation is...

24:30.027 --> 24:31.228
Are you gonna use the "M" word?

24:32.662 --> 24:34.264
You seriously can't say it?

24:34.298 --> 24:38.435
Only when referencing
the 1980 U.S. hockey team.

24:38.468 --> 24:40.537
Keep testing.
Anything you can think of.

24:40.570 --> 24:42.906
Molecular markers,
T-cells, PD-L1.

24:42.939 --> 24:45.442
We'll need permission
from the patient.

24:45.475 --> 24:46.743
Which raises another issue,

24:46.776 --> 24:48.645
what are we gonna
do next, medically?

24:48.678 --> 24:50.380
He was supposed to
start chemo next week.

24:50.414 --> 24:51.848
No, it'll wipe out
his immune system,

24:51.881 --> 24:54.018
which may be what's
actually killing his cancer.

24:54.051 --> 24:55.952
If we don't know
what's making him better,

24:55.986 --> 24:57.921
we don't know what
to stop, what to start.

25:00.924 --> 25:02.392
So we do nothing?

25:03.327 --> 25:05.495
Just trust God to fix him?

25:05.529 --> 25:08.732
We trust whatever is currently
fixing him to keep fixing him.

25:08.765 --> 25:10.467
If he took a Tylenol
yesterday at 8:00,

25:10.500 --> 25:12.069
he takes a Tylenol
today at 8:00.

25:12.102 --> 25:14.804
Monitor him. Closely.
Scans constantly.

25:31.688 --> 25:32.689
Hmm.

25:39.029 --> 25:41.065
Hello, Dr. Glassman.

25:41.098 --> 25:42.932
Hi.
Thank you for coming.

25:44.201 --> 25:47.504
He has been doing this
for two hours.

25:49.839 --> 25:50.840
Shaun.

25:52.242 --> 25:53.343
What are you up to?

25:54.344 --> 25:56.280
Alphabetizing our canned goods

25:56.313 --> 25:58.915
and checking
all the expiration dates.

25:58.948 --> 26:00.284
Well, somebody's got to do it.

26:01.885 --> 26:03.353
Is something wrong?
No.

26:09.326 --> 26:11.928
Okay.
Okay. I think

26:11.961 --> 26:15.499
Dr. Lim's patient's
diagnosis is wrong,

26:15.532 --> 26:17.467
but I can't prove it
without information,

26:17.501 --> 26:20.537
and I'm not allowed
to talk to patients.

26:20.570 --> 26:22.072
Shaun.

26:25.975 --> 26:27.677
I want to run with things.

26:28.712 --> 26:31.648
I want to fix people.

26:34.184 --> 26:36.920
Can you help me become
a surgical resident again?

26:38.422 --> 26:40.857
No. I can't, Shaun.

26:40.890 --> 26:42.326
I'm not president...
Yes.

26:43.860 --> 26:47.364
I'm not the president of
the hospital anymore, Shaun.

26:47.397 --> 26:50.500
And even...
Even if I was, it's irrelevant.

26:51.335 --> 26:53.537
You have to stand up
for yourself.

26:54.438 --> 26:55.572
And you know what?
If you can't,

26:55.605 --> 26:58.375
then the new Head of Surgery,
the Chief, he's right.

26:59.843 --> 27:02.011
Now, I can go
tell him he's wrong.

27:02.045 --> 27:03.813
It won't do any good.

27:03.847 --> 27:05.415
Or you can go show him.

27:12.922 --> 27:15.725
I'm doing research
concerning Sadie Barnes.

27:17.527 --> 27:18.895
She's asleep.

27:20.397 --> 27:23.367
Perfect. I'm not allowed
to speak with her.

27:26.436 --> 27:28.805
I'm looking for her sister Jess.

27:30.307 --> 27:32.209
I haven't seen her.
Sorry.

28:04.974 --> 28:06.443
What are you doing?

28:14.262 --> 28:18.199
Can you explain why, instead of
remaining in pathology as directed,

28:18.233 --> 28:21.669
you were in a patient's room,
going through her purse?

28:21.702 --> 28:24.405
I didn't speak to her.
She was asleep.

28:27.375 --> 28:30.044
Dr. Murphy,
any reticence I had

28:30.077 --> 28:32.213
about removing you from
surgery just vanished.

28:33.414 --> 28:36.050
You shouldn't be in
contact with patients.

28:36.083 --> 28:38.219
Or their families.
Or anything they own.

28:38.253 --> 28:40.855
Do you understand, or am I
gonna be forced to fire you?

28:45.693 --> 28:48.229
Sadie's social media says that

28:48.263 --> 28:49.864
she finances her climbing travel

28:49.897 --> 28:52.066
by working as
a freelance food critic.

28:53.201 --> 28:55.770
She reviewed a Japanese
restaurant that used to have

28:55.803 --> 28:58.873
a Restaurant Grading System Score of
"A," but then it dropped to a "C,"

28:58.906 --> 29:02.109
which corresponds to very
bad food safety practices.

29:02.143 --> 29:04.645
Bad sushi can lead to worms,
but it usually doesn't

29:04.679 --> 29:07.448
because stomach acid almost
always kills fish parasites.

29:07.482 --> 29:09.517
But not if someone
is taking an acid blocker,

29:09.550 --> 29:11.452
which 60 million Americans are.

29:11.486 --> 29:13.588
I saw a bottle in her purse.

29:17.792 --> 29:20.695
Sadie could have sparganosis

29:20.728 --> 29:23.998
with an encapsulated worm that
is mimicking a meningioma.

29:27.702 --> 29:29.003
That's a good idea.

29:30.070 --> 29:32.307
Excellent.
I'll tell the patient.

29:32.340 --> 29:34.309
I will tell the patient.

29:35.343 --> 29:36.611
I'll tell her
we're doing a biopsy

29:36.644 --> 29:38.279
to confirm
the initial diagnosis.

29:38.313 --> 29:39.980
But we're...
It will tell us

29:40.014 --> 29:42.082
if the initial diagnosis
is correct.

29:43.050 --> 29:44.885
Your theory is a real long shot.

29:44.919 --> 29:47.488
It would be irresponsible
to get her hopes up.

29:50.291 --> 29:51.559
Hmm.

29:51.592 --> 29:52.827
The surgery went well.

29:52.860 --> 29:55.830
We were able to extract the
entire tumor without complication.

29:57.698 --> 29:58.699
Thank you.

30:00.268 --> 30:01.302
When can we start chemo?

30:02.503 --> 30:06.106
There are a few follow-up
tests we want to run first.

30:06.140 --> 30:07.775
And we want to retake
your history.

30:07.808 --> 30:09.176
Make sure we have a proper list

30:09.210 --> 30:10.778
of all medications
you've been taking.

30:12.179 --> 30:15.049
You want to take his history
after the surgery?

30:15.082 --> 30:17.485
What's going on?
What are you not telling us?

30:17.518 --> 30:19.287
What went wrong?
Nothing.

30:19.320 --> 30:22.657
The fact is, the surgery went

30:22.690 --> 30:24.124
better than we'd hoped.

30:24.825 --> 30:26.227
Your cancer seems to be

30:27.828 --> 30:29.597
going away on its own.

30:32.132 --> 30:33.834
We'll run our tests.

30:33.868 --> 30:37.505
We're confident that there
is a medical explanation.

30:37.538 --> 30:39.874
Oh, Clarence.

30:55.155 --> 30:57.658
Hi.
Hi, Aaron.

30:57.692 --> 31:01.195
Um, what I...

31:01.228 --> 31:04.665
What I told you earlier,
that I'm seeing someone...

31:04.699 --> 31:05.866
I'm not.

31:05.900 --> 31:08.303
I mean, I-I-I had one date,

31:08.336 --> 31:10.070
but it wasn't, you know... Okay.

31:14.174 --> 31:17.378
We're... We're just...
We're not a good match.

31:17.412 --> 31:19.179
That's what
I wanted to tell you.

31:25.420 --> 31:27.855
That's not true, you know.

31:27.888 --> 31:29.324
You know, that's not true.

31:29.357 --> 31:30.691
You like me. A lot.

31:30.725 --> 31:33.227
And I like you
even more than that.

31:33.260 --> 31:34.762
So what is this?

31:34.795 --> 31:36.831
You know, I'd really
rather not get into it.

31:36.864 --> 31:39.367
You came to my house...
To tell you what I told you,

31:39.400 --> 31:41.369
which I just told you.
Okay, you came here to be honest,

31:41.402 --> 31:43.037
and you're only
gonna be honest halfway?

31:43.070 --> 31:44.372
You're not timid.
No.

31:44.405 --> 31:45.940
Okay. Then what?

31:49.310 --> 31:51.211
The last time I was here,

31:51.245 --> 31:52.647
we were headed upstairs...

31:53.914 --> 31:54.949
Yes, we were.

31:55.783 --> 31:56.784
You fell.

31:57.785 --> 31:58.853
Yes, I did.

31:58.886 --> 32:01.456
I tried to help you,
and you pushed me away.

32:02.657 --> 32:03.891
I was embarrassed.

32:03.924 --> 32:05.292
You were sick.

32:05.326 --> 32:07.795
You needed help.
And I'm not sick anymore.

32:07.828 --> 32:11.031
Maybe.
And I want to go and celebrate.

32:11.065 --> 32:13.601
With you.
Specifically with you.

32:13.634 --> 32:15.202
'Cause we have fun.

32:15.235 --> 32:18.305
You... You make...
You make me laugh.

32:18.339 --> 32:20.908
You make me feel good.

32:20.941 --> 32:22.209
I like being with you.

32:22.242 --> 32:23.778
Sounds horrible.

32:23.811 --> 32:26.213
But bad things are gonna happen.

32:26.246 --> 32:29.484
Aaron, I-it can't just be
about having fun together.

32:29.517 --> 32:30.985
One of us is gonna get sick,

32:31.018 --> 32:32.987
one of us is gonna need
to be taken care of...

32:33.020 --> 32:34.989
Wait, wait, wait.
I just want to go out

32:35.022 --> 32:37.425
and have a nice dinner with you.

32:37.458 --> 32:40.361
Not to run away to Reno,
find a priest in an Elvis suit.

32:43.664 --> 32:45.299
What are we gonna do, Aaron?

32:45.332 --> 32:48.936
Just drive to a hill with
a view and neck till prom?

32:48.969 --> 32:51.472
And then I'm gonna come home
and hope you call?

32:58.145 --> 33:01.649
Yeah, uh, you know,
I just came to apologize.

33:03.283 --> 33:04.519
I'm sorry.

33:05.453 --> 33:06.987
And I'm really glad...

33:08.789 --> 33:11.191
I'm... I'm glad
you're finished with chemo.

33:11.225 --> 33:13.060
And...

33:14.962 --> 33:16.831
You're gonna...
You're gonna beat this thing.

33:40.455 --> 33:42.356
Your immunoglobulins are normal.

33:42.389 --> 33:44.191
Everything is normal.

33:44.224 --> 33:46.360
We can't find
a scientific explanation.

33:49.697 --> 33:52.266
Our prayers...
It's a miracle.

33:54.669 --> 33:56.170
Miracle or not,

33:56.203 --> 33:58.405
it seems we're
on the same page now.

34:00.074 --> 34:03.544
There is no reason not to do the
spinal fusion to eliminate your pain.

34:07.615 --> 34:08.683
Do more tests.

34:09.550 --> 34:11.819
Clarence.
There are no more tests.

34:11.851 --> 34:14.353
T-T-There must be.
There must be an explanation.

34:14.388 --> 34:16.724
Redo your tests.
Find new tests.

34:21.261 --> 34:23.664
"Let all bitterness and wrath

34:23.697 --> 34:27.234
"and anger and clamor and
slander be put away from you."

34:31.871 --> 34:33.407
Ephesians 4:31.

34:35.743 --> 34:37.110
I didn't take you
for a believer.

34:37.143 --> 34:38.579
I'm not, anymore.

34:40.246 --> 34:41.748
I'm not sure you are either.

34:44.784 --> 34:48.623
God speaks directly to Noah,

34:48.656 --> 34:51.759
Moses, Job, and Solomon.

34:51.792 --> 34:53.960
And now apparently
he has singled out

34:53.994 --> 34:55.795
Pastor Clarence of San Jose

34:55.830 --> 34:57.665
to join the ranks
of the prophets.

34:59.166 --> 35:02.402
I'm sorry, but unless
there is a burning bush,

35:02.436 --> 35:04.639
it is narcissistic
to think that God

35:04.672 --> 35:07.174
has made you
his personal project.

35:07.207 --> 35:09.844
God speaks to every one of us.

35:11.478 --> 35:14.048
You just have to listen.
You are not listening.

35:15.015 --> 35:17.785
People get cancer all the time.

35:17.818 --> 35:19.319
Often that results in pain.

35:19.353 --> 35:20.888
Those things are not unique.

35:20.921 --> 35:22.723
What is unique

35:22.757 --> 35:25.292
is having an aggressive
metastatic cancer

35:25.325 --> 35:29.263
start to disappear without
any rational explanation.

35:30.731 --> 35:32.399
The issue isn't God.

35:33.801 --> 35:35.703
You have to forgive yourself.

35:40.474 --> 35:41.742
What I did...

35:41.776 --> 35:43.110
Cannot be undone.

35:43.678 --> 35:45.279
But your pain can.

35:53.020 --> 35:54.521
Clarence.

35:59.660 --> 36:00.961
Your pain...

36:03.397 --> 36:05.566
Your pain does no one any good.

36:13.641 --> 36:14.675
Okay.

36:21.478 --> 36:23.080
Osteotome and mallet.

36:27.684 --> 36:31.088
You lied when you said you never
went to church. What happened?

36:31.122 --> 36:34.158
I didn't want to have this
conversation is what happened.

36:34.191 --> 36:35.259
I'm not judging.

36:35.292 --> 36:36.961
My brother took
a year off school to travel

36:36.994 --> 36:37.995
and came back a non-believer.

36:38.595 --> 36:39.763
So ask him.

36:47.238 --> 36:50.674
Was it freeing,
or did you feel empty?

36:50.707 --> 36:52.876
Hand me the
first polyaxial pedicle screw.

36:59.316 --> 37:01.085
It was like losing a loved one.

37:19.070 --> 37:20.604
The moment of truth.

37:31.415 --> 37:32.683
Follow me.

37:52.703 --> 37:55.072
Our initial diagnosis was wrong.

37:55.106 --> 37:56.840
You don't have a meningioma.

37:56.873 --> 37:58.075
You have a worm in your brain.

38:00.944 --> 38:03.780
And while that sounds fairly gross,

38:03.814 --> 38:05.616
it is completely curable.

38:11.955 --> 38:16.460
So, the sense of doom, it was...
It was wrong?

38:16.493 --> 38:19.530
It saved your life.
As did Dr. Murphy.

38:19.563 --> 38:21.532
This is the pathologist
who noticed

38:21.565 --> 38:23.134
an abnormality
in one of your tests.

38:26.570 --> 38:28.572
That led us to this discovery.

38:29.573 --> 38:31.342
Can I give you a hug, too, Dr. Murphy?

38:32.343 --> 38:33.344
No.

38:36.713 --> 38:39.083
You and your sister
will be free to conquer

38:39.116 --> 38:41.718
whichever of the remaining
50 peaks you choose

38:41.752 --> 38:43.987
as soon as my team
surgically removes the worm.

38:51.428 --> 38:53.097
Thank you.
Oh! Of course.

38:55.432 --> 38:57.801
There are not a lot of doctors
who would have made the leap

38:57.834 --> 38:59.470
that you made today, Shaun.

39:01.004 --> 39:02.039
Good work.

39:03.507 --> 39:07.044
Yes, it was excellent work.

39:08.212 --> 39:09.680
Most people
would say "thank you,"

39:09.713 --> 39:12.483
but technically that's not
an incorrect response.

39:13.150 --> 39:14.651
Hmm.

39:14.685 --> 39:16.853
Have a good evening.
You've earned it.

39:21.425 --> 39:23.560
I don't want to go on walks.

39:29.133 --> 39:31.835
I don't want to move on
from cases

39:31.868 --> 39:34.004
after the tests are done.

39:35.906 --> 39:40.144
I do not want to be
a pathologist.

39:43.147 --> 39:48.185
Dr. Han, you need to make me
a surgical resident again.

39:54.725 --> 39:56.427
I appreciate
you telling me that.

39:58.061 --> 40:00.597
I was wondering whether you had it
in you to advocate for yourself.

40:04.601 --> 40:06.237
But the truth is, Shaun,

40:06.270 --> 40:09.005
what you did today,

40:09.039 --> 40:10.441
it proved I'm right.

40:11.908 --> 40:14.044
Your skills are tremendous.

40:14.077 --> 40:17.181
Your weaknesses,
equally significant.

40:19.383 --> 40:22.052
You could be
a great pathologist.

40:22.085 --> 40:24.488
Just think of all
the Sadies out there,

40:24.521 --> 40:26.257
waiting for you to save them.

40:56.420 --> 40:58.589
Dr. Browne,
Dr. Reznick.

40:58.622 --> 41:00.991
The surgery went well.
Your spine is stable.

41:04.995 --> 41:06.330
I'm scared.

41:07.831 --> 41:10.634
There may still be some residual
pain as you heal, but...

41:10.667 --> 41:12.102
No, I...

41:13.337 --> 41:17.174
I keep wondering,
what if I disobeyed God?

41:24.281 --> 41:25.349
You have to have faith.

41:27.284 --> 41:28.619
But you lost yours.

41:31.822 --> 41:34.525
I didn't have a miracle to
help me through the dark times.
