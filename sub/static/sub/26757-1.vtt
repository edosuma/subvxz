01:51.175 --> 01:53.090
What did she say?

01:54.382 --> 01:57.255
I think she said
that we're getting close.

01:57.257 --> 01:59.175
Can we end construction now?

02:02.715 --> 02:04.507
Back where you found it.

02:06.590 --> 02:07.882
Hey.

02:14.800 --> 02:16.715
I think I'm a little nervous.

02:21.340 --> 02:22.300
Thanks.

02:25.050 --> 02:28.050
If Grandpa's so sick,
why isn't he in the hospital?

02:31.757 --> 02:35.380
Because he won't be sick
much longer.

02:53.675 --> 02:55.590
I remember this road.

02:57.800 --> 02:59.175
- Thanks.
- Yes.

03:46.215 --> 03:47.840
What's wrong?

03:49.675 --> 03:52.007
Nothing. Come on.

04:15.382 --> 04:16.757
Hello, Yelena.

04:22.048 --> 04:23.965
What are you doing here?

04:28.465 --> 04:30.175
Frank wrote me.

04:32.383 --> 04:35.173
The letter said he's sick.

04:35.175 --> 04:37.090
You should have called.

04:44.300 --> 04:45.883
This is Willow.

04:47.590 --> 04:48.757
Hi.

05:03.925 --> 05:05.258
Come in.

05:08.175 --> 05:09.675
Okay, come on.

05:43.340 --> 05:47.090
Your husband doesn't mind you
traveling so far alone?

05:51.425 --> 05:52.883
I'm not married.

05:59.425 --> 06:02.215
You shouldn't have brought
the baby here.

06:36.883 --> 06:38.800
How long has he been like this?

06:41.800 --> 06:44.215
He has been sick for many years.

06:46.550 --> 06:47.883
Can I see him?

06:55.590 --> 06:58.632
It is best that we do not
disturb him in the evening.

07:02.800 --> 07:06.923
We should call the taxi
and discuss this tomorrow.

07:06.925 --> 07:07.923
Oh, I...

07:07.925 --> 07:09.923
There is this very nice hotel

07:09.925 --> 07:12.338
in the town.

07:12.340 --> 07:14.423
Let me get my book.

07:47.633 --> 07:52.463
Uh, this is taxi
and, uh, this is the inn.

07:52.465 --> 07:55.675
It's a good place.
The phone in there on table.

08:10.383 --> 08:12.550
I can't get a dial tone.

08:26.050 --> 08:28.008
The weather can cause trouble.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.715
Maybe we could stay here
tonight.

08:33.631 --> 08:35.589
This is not possible.

08:35.591 --> 08:38.716
But the inn is only
a few kilometers away.

08:40.381 --> 08:41.589
Oh, it's freezing outside.

08:41.591 --> 08:44.005
I don't wanna walk her
all night in the cold.

08:44.006 --> 08:47.714
Children are much stronger
than you think, Madeline.

08:47.716 --> 08:49.255
She will be fine.

08:49.257 --> 08:51.380
Don't tell me
she'll be fine, okay?

08:51.382 --> 08:52.589
I don't need parenting advice
from a woman

08:52.591 --> 08:54.508
who abandoned her child.

09:02.675 --> 09:04.382
Repeat, please.

09:09.050 --> 09:11.548
I don't need parenting advice

09:11.550 --> 09:13.507
from a woman
who abandoned her child.

09:20.050 --> 09:23.464
I did not abandon you.

09:23.466 --> 09:26.716
I wanted you
to have a better life!

09:35.300 --> 09:37.380
This conversation
isn't appropriate

09:37.382 --> 09:39.300
in front of the child.

09:50.300 --> 09:51.632
I agree.

09:55.591 --> 09:57.714
- No, sweetie, we have to go.
- Where are we going?

09:57.716 --> 09:59.633
- I don't wanna leave.
- Please.

10:01.257 --> 10:02.715
My apologies.

10:05.132 --> 10:06.925
You should, please, stay.

10:09.007 --> 10:11.757
But there are things I..

10:12.841 --> 10:14.758
...wanted to tell you.

10:16.675 --> 10:18.757
We can discuss this in morning.

10:23.257 --> 10:24.425
Please.

10:36.466 --> 10:37.591
Goodnight.

10:38.507 --> 10:40.048
Goodnight.

10:40.050 --> 10:41.839
Goodnight.

10:41.841 --> 10:44.425
Oh! What this?

10:46.716 --> 10:48.883
- I made this.
- Oh.

10:51.425 --> 10:55.091
I used to make these
with your mother.

10:59.800 --> 11:02.714
Did she ever tell you that?

11:10.466 --> 11:11.800
Goodnight.

11:17.675 --> 11:18.800
Madeline.

11:20.257 --> 11:22.257
Mommy, was this your room?

11:56.132 --> 11:57.632
Yelena?

12:18.425 --> 12:20.757
Madeline.

12:22.132 --> 12:23.425
Madeline.

12:28.550 --> 12:30.882
- You warm?
- Toasty.

12:34.132 --> 12:35.590
Good.

12:39.550 --> 12:42.632
Are you mad or are you sad?

12:45.800 --> 12:47.466
I'm just tired.

12:50.007 --> 12:51.925
You wanna say
your goodnight prayers?

12:56.716 --> 13:00.880
Angels bless and angels keep

13:00.882 --> 13:03.839
angels guard me while I sleep.

13:03.841 --> 13:07.589
Bless my heart
and bless my home

13:07.591 --> 13:10.800
bless my spirit as I roam.

13:19.966 --> 13:22.425
Jesus, we shouldn't be here.

18:38.258 --> 18:40.425
Madeline, are you alright?

18:44.258 --> 18:47.173
Come on, get up. You'll freeze.

18:47.175 --> 18:49.923
Inside! It's cold!

18:49.925 --> 18:51.463
Go!

18:51.465 --> 18:53.382
Why am I out here?

19:21.425 --> 19:23.215
I don't think..

19:24.465 --> 19:26.923
At least
your daughter is here

19:26.925 --> 19:30.965
and family is what
is important now.

19:36.675 --> 19:38.550
Hello, Madeline.

19:42.258 --> 19:44.175
You remember Father Joseph?

19:51.133 --> 19:52.213
That's enough.

19:52.215 --> 19:55.175
You still wear the cross
I gave you.

19:57.383 --> 19:59.050
Uh, I do.

20:00.715 --> 20:04.088
Can I fix you
some breakfast, Madeline?

20:04.090 --> 20:06.881
No, that's okay.
We're gonna have to get going.

20:06.883 --> 20:08.633
Get a room in the town.

20:10.508 --> 20:12.173
Here, you want some cheese.

20:20.508 --> 20:22.050
Finish your food.

20:23.383 --> 20:25.756
Your mother was just
telling me about

20:25.758 --> 20:28.548
your sleepwalking episode
last night.

20:31.215 --> 20:32.925
How are you feeling?

20:38.258 --> 20:39.633
Fine.

20:43.465 --> 20:46.256
I'm very sorry
about your father.

20:46.258 --> 20:47.883
He is, uh..

20:50.965 --> 20:52.673
...a good friend

20:52.675 --> 20:54.381
and was a very gifted priest.

20:54.383 --> 20:56.463
Father Joseph has been coming

20:56.465 --> 20:59.338
for morning prayer with him.

20:59.340 --> 21:04.256
He has been very generous
with his time.

21:04.258 --> 21:06.588
We all must find forgiveness.

21:06.590 --> 21:08.338
Will you join us, Madeline?

21:10.008 --> 21:11.923
It's important for your father

21:11.925 --> 21:14.340
to find peace before he dies.

21:20.050 --> 21:21.338
No.

21:21.340 --> 21:24.923
Um, I think we should
probably get walking.

21:24.925 --> 21:28.713
Walk? I'll drive you into town
on my way back.

21:28.715 --> 21:30.548
I think that's okay.

21:30.550 --> 21:32.923
Mom, you said
I was gonna meet Grandpa.

21:32.925 --> 21:34.173
Come on.

21:34.175 --> 21:35.963
You've come this far, Madeline.

21:35.965 --> 21:38.090
Please join us.

21:39.508 --> 21:42.425
You won't have another chance
to say goodbye.

21:58.425 --> 22:00.965
Frank, Madeline is here..

22:02.883 --> 22:04.633
...with your granddaughter.

22:07.590 --> 22:09.215
This is Willow.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.257
She made this for you.

22:26.258 --> 22:28.798
Madeline. Madeline.

22:28.800 --> 22:32.673
Do you know your prayers,
Willow?

22:32.675 --> 22:34.298
Some of them.

22:34.300 --> 22:37.338
What about Come, Holy Spirit?

22:38.550 --> 22:40.423
Mnh-mnh.

22:40.425 --> 22:42.340
Would you like to learn it?

22:44.508 --> 22:47.463
Come, O Holy Spirit.

22:47.465 --> 22:52.548
Fill the hearts
of your faithful.

22:54.840 --> 22:58.382
Send forth your spirit
and they shall be created.

23:01.508 --> 23:03.173
Send forth your..

23:03.175 --> 23:05.923
Mommy!

23:05.925 --> 23:08.463
Mommy!

23:42.258 --> 23:43.675
Madeline?

23:53.508 --> 23:55.048
What's going on?

23:59.550 --> 24:01.338
Why am I tied down?

24:01.340 --> 24:03.088
Willow? Where's my daughter?

24:03.090 --> 24:06.548
She is downstairs
with your mother.

24:06.550 --> 24:08.300
Why are my hands tied?

24:09.633 --> 24:12.048
Because you lost control.

24:16.840 --> 24:19.215
You did not imagine it.

24:20.840 --> 24:23.175
What the hell
is happening to me?

24:27.258 --> 24:28.466
No.

24:30.590 --> 24:32.840
I believe you have been blessed.

24:36.008 --> 24:38.258
The holy wounds of Stigmata.

24:46.633 --> 24:47.758
I..

24:49.590 --> 24:52.963
I just came here to see my dad.

24:52.965 --> 24:54.175
No.

24:55.465 --> 24:59.756
That is not why you come here.

24:59.758 --> 25:01.506
Let me go! Please, please.

25:01.508 --> 25:03.925
Please, just let me go.
Just let me go.

25:05.758 --> 25:07.631
I perform mass

25:07.633 --> 25:10.548
for the Sisters
of Mercy Convent.

25:10.550 --> 25:14.758
Pray, Mother Superior
may be able to help you.

25:18.840 --> 25:19.965
Willow!

25:21.175 --> 25:22.383
Willow?

25:23.550 --> 25:25.588
Willow!

25:25.590 --> 25:27.838
Yelena, where is she?

25:27.840 --> 25:29.465
Where is she?

25:39.090 --> 25:41.090
Willow, come here. Come on.

25:45.090 --> 25:46.088
Come...

25:46.090 --> 25:49.631
Madeline, you almost killed her.

25:49.633 --> 25:52.341
I tried to keep this from you.

25:54.133 --> 25:57.548
You are a danger
to your daughter here

25:57.550 --> 26:01.175
but Mercy
is a cloistered convent.

26:02.675 --> 26:05.048
If you want to protect her

26:05.050 --> 26:07.713
you will have to go there.

26:07.715 --> 26:09.465
Trust him, Madeline.

26:10.675 --> 26:12.340
Trust him.

26:20.508 --> 26:21.758
Can I get a hug?

26:24.050 --> 26:26.133
When are you coming back?

26:29.008 --> 26:30.383
Soon.

26:39.133 --> 26:41.841
Madeline, we have to leave.

26:43.425 --> 26:46.298
Hey, you wanna say
our nighttime prayer?

26:46.300 --> 26:47.465
Mm.

26:48.550 --> 26:52.088
Angels bless and angels keep

26:52.090 --> 26:55.548
angels guard me while I sleep.

26:55.550 --> 26:59.088
Bless my heart
and bless my home

26:59.090 --> 27:01.757
bless my spirit as I roam.

27:55.550 --> 27:57.006
I'm not crazy about water.

27:57.008 --> 27:58.216
Tsk.

28:03.883 --> 28:08.548
Consider your fear
and let it go.

28:08.550 --> 28:11.881
There are more dangerous things
than water.

28:11.883 --> 28:13.883
Is that supposed
to make me feel better?

28:16.508 --> 28:17.758
Yes.

29:21.675 --> 29:25.881
♪ John Brown's body lies
a-moldering in the grave ♪

29:25.883 --> 29:30.463
♪ John Brown's body lies
a-moldering in the grave ♪

29:30.465 --> 29:34.006
♪ John Brown's body lies
a-moldering in the grave ♪

29:34.008 --> 29:37.800
♪ But his soul
goes marching on ♪♪

29:39.965 --> 29:42.048
Don't be afraid, child.

29:42.050 --> 29:44.840
Mother Superior will know
what to do.

29:49.590 --> 29:51.507
You'll find all kinds
of women here.

29:52.840 --> 29:55.131
They start as postulants

29:55.133 --> 29:59.048
and after a year,
they become novices.

29:59.050 --> 30:01.256
Some are educated

30:01.258 --> 30:03.675
widowed, orphaned.

30:04.758 --> 30:07.588
Some have grown children.

30:07.590 --> 30:10.507
But all of them are here
for guidance..

30:12.133 --> 30:13.341
...like you.

30:18.133 --> 30:21.631
And what sort of guidance
do you have for me?

30:21.633 --> 30:26.048
I am authorized by the church

30:26.050 --> 30:28.963
to identify a very specific set

30:28.965 --> 30:32.465
of physical and spiritual signs.

30:33.965 --> 30:38.588
If what you are experiencing
is genuine

30:38.590 --> 30:43.507
then submitting to the spiritual
disciplines of our order..

30:45.050 --> 30:48.923
...will help induce
this great gift.

30:48.925 --> 30:50.838
But I don't want
to bring it back.

30:50.840 --> 30:52.881
I wanna get rid of it.

30:52.883 --> 30:54.425
Once witnessed..

30:55.840 --> 30:57.882
...it can be assessed.

31:00.840 --> 31:03.006
I'd like to call my daughter.

31:03.008 --> 31:05.425
And I want to help you.

31:12.008 --> 31:15.381
There are certain rules
we all follow.

31:15.383 --> 31:18.506
We are not to leave our rooms
after the evening bell.

31:18.508 --> 31:20.048
We do not wander alone

31:20.050 --> 31:22.506
and we do not speak
without reason to do so.

31:22.508 --> 31:25.713
And we do not go
to the bell tower.

31:25.715 --> 31:27.338
That's the torture chamber.

31:27.340 --> 31:30.088
Excuse me,
I should have said most of us

31:30.090 --> 31:32.132
do not speak
without reason to do so.

31:51.383 --> 31:53.841
So what do you think
of our esteemed Mother Superior?

31:55.175 --> 31:57.131
- She seems nice.
- Isn't she?

31:57.133 --> 31:59.050
Just don't get on her bad side.

32:01.633 --> 32:03.633
She doesn't have a bad side.

32:04.925 --> 32:06.883
Alyona's very devout.

32:23.008 --> 32:24.716
Fancy, right?

32:38.258 --> 32:40.798
So here are your vestments.

32:40.800 --> 32:42.756
Casual clothes
are not permitted.

32:42.758 --> 32:44.300
Oh, God forbid.

32:52.965 --> 32:54.925
Morning prayer begins at 7:00.

32:56.258 --> 32:58.175
I'd like to call my daughter.

33:02.050 --> 33:03.465
Yes.

33:07.633 --> 33:08.966
Welcome to Mercy.

33:12.300 --> 33:14.300
She's an odd girl, isn't she?

33:23.383 --> 33:26.258
I found her in the garden.
She's a refugee.

33:28.090 --> 33:30.465
I used to have a cat just like
that when I was little.

33:37.090 --> 33:38.465
Hey.

33:42.090 --> 33:44.007
Everyone's talking about you.

33:45.465 --> 33:47.007
They say you're cursed.

33:55.840 --> 33:57.838
You gonna try it on?

34:16.841 --> 34:19.045
That's the evening bell.

34:19.047 --> 34:20.590
I'll see you tomorrow.

34:22.422 --> 34:24.214
I'll show you around.

34:24.216 --> 34:26.007
I know what it's like
to be new here.

34:51.382 --> 34:53.299
Madeline.

36:21.091 --> 36:22.925
Madeline.

36:32.383 --> 36:34.339
Amen.

36:34.341 --> 36:35.550
- Amen.
- Amen.

36:41.758 --> 36:46.008
It's quite normal that others
might feel threatened by you.

36:49.175 --> 36:52.341
What you have is physical.

36:54.675 --> 36:57.214
Tangible evidence

36:57.216 --> 36:59.383
in a world of abstracts.

37:12.383 --> 37:14.425
Envy is a sin.

37:16.550 --> 37:19.133
We are all sinners, aren't we?

37:24.800 --> 37:29.133
Now would you like
to call your daughter?

37:31.133 --> 37:33.050
Let her know you're alright.

37:36.425 --> 37:37.591
Yes.

38:22.508 --> 38:24.381
Hello?

38:24.383 --> 38:25.591
Hello?

38:28.091 --> 38:31.089
What happened
at your parents' house?

38:31.091 --> 38:32.423
There's something wrong
with the phone.

38:32.425 --> 38:34.923
The lines are old.

38:34.925 --> 38:37.298
They get frozen sometimes.

38:37.300 --> 38:39.506
We can try again later.

38:52.550 --> 38:55.466
What happened
at your parents' house?

38:59.341 --> 39:00.925
I don't remember.

39:02.008 --> 39:03.383
Yes, you do.

39:06.341 --> 39:07.883
Sit down.

39:20.508 --> 39:22.050
Loosen your hair.

39:23.841 --> 39:25.216
Why?

39:28.258 --> 39:30.508
I want you to relax.

39:40.425 --> 39:42.175
Close your eyes.

39:45.966 --> 39:48.383
Now clear your mind..

39:51.716 --> 39:54.216
...and breathe.

39:59.633 --> 40:01.506
What do you remember?

40:09.383 --> 40:13.214
I heard noises
coming from the barn.

40:17.008 --> 40:20.006
What noises did you hear?

40:20.008 --> 40:23.423
Hear?

40:23.425 --> 40:25.550
A cat was crying
inside the well.

40:31.800 --> 40:33.131
Go deeper.

40:34.841 --> 40:36.508
Deeper! Deeper!

40:40.716 --> 40:42.466
Come with me.

40:46.633 --> 40:48.466
What do you see?

40:59.550 --> 41:00.841
I'm a child.

41:07.050 --> 41:08.548
Angels bless and angels keep

41:08.550 --> 41:10.339
angels guard me while I sleep.

41:10.341 --> 41:11.798
Bless my heart
and bless my home

41:11.800 --> 41:13.673
bless my spirit as I roam.

41:13.675 --> 41:14.964
Angels guard and angels keep

41:14.966 --> 41:16.798
angels guard me while I sleep.

41:16.800 --> 41:19.381
Bless my heart and bless
my home, bless my spirit..

41:33.675 --> 41:36.300
Bless my spirit, bless
my heart, bless my spirit..

41:38.716 --> 41:40.006
Help!

41:40.008 --> 41:41.881
No, Madeline.

41:41.883 --> 41:44.508
You need to go back
down the well!

41:49.258 --> 41:51.631
Sit down, Madeline.
We're not finished.

41:51.633 --> 41:54.464
Wha.. What was that?

42:02.091 --> 42:05.631
Stigmatics are blessed
with wounds

42:05.633 --> 42:08.466
as a connection
to the sufferings of Christ.

42:16.758 --> 42:20.214
But I'm afraid
you are experiencing wounds

42:20.216 --> 42:24.714
as a connection
to the sufferings of your life.

42:24.716 --> 42:26.633
What's that supposed to mean?

42:28.925 --> 42:31.633
Old wounds can cause new ones.

42:33.383 --> 42:37.006
There is something dangerous
trapped inside you, Madeline

42:37.008 --> 42:39.589
and we need to drag it out.

42:39.591 --> 42:41.798
We'll try again tomorrow.

42:41.800 --> 42:45.300
Spend the afternoon
in thoughtful prayer.

42:49.383 --> 42:50.883
Peace be with you.

43:01.925 --> 43:04.048
Come on up here.

43:04.050 --> 43:06.758
If you stay in the yard, they'll
end up giving you a broom.

43:14.550 --> 43:16.925
I swear, someday I'm gonna burn
these clothes.

43:19.300 --> 43:22.425
This is pretty much the only
place that we can talk freely.

43:24.675 --> 43:27.675
Plus, it comes
with other benefits.

43:31.008 --> 43:32.300
Mew-mew.

43:35.841 --> 43:37.758
Do you want to hold her?

43:49.883 --> 43:51.175
You okay?

43:53.758 --> 43:55.008
Yeah.

44:07.675 --> 44:08.633
I'm not.

44:12.175 --> 44:13.466
I'm not okay.

44:16.383 --> 44:19.758
I came here looking for answers
and for help.

44:21.425 --> 44:26.258
And Mother Superior said
that the problem is with me.

44:36.591 --> 44:38.508
Do you know why I'm here?

44:42.800 --> 44:44.591
They said you had the signs.

44:50.841 --> 44:52.758
I almost killed my daughter.

44:55.508 --> 44:57.425
Did they tell you that?

45:00.008 --> 45:01.383
No.

45:03.758 --> 45:06.050
I grabbed her and I sent her
flying across the room..

45:07.300 --> 45:10.506
....and I threw her
as hard as I could.

45:10.508 --> 45:12.964
And now her face is swollen

45:12.966 --> 45:14.839
and she has bruises
all over her

45:14.841 --> 45:16.841
and blood on her eye and..

45:18.175 --> 45:20.675
When she looks at me..

45:22.008 --> 45:24.506
...how scared she is..

45:24.508 --> 45:26.881
...and I just,
I just wanna, like, die.

45:26.883 --> 45:29.131
I just wanna fucking die.

45:29.133 --> 45:30.966
And I just..

45:35.133 --> 45:38.756
It's just something that..

45:38.758 --> 45:40.881
...came out of me.

45:40.883 --> 45:42.966
And I don't know how to explain
that to my daughter.

45:45.925 --> 45:47.841
So I'm in this place.

45:50.258 --> 45:52.089
Like, just hoping for a sign

45:52.091 --> 45:54.008
that I'm doing
the right thing, but..

45:56.841 --> 45:59.964
...I don't know
why this happened

45:59.966 --> 46:02.258
or what's inside of me.

46:14.966 --> 46:16.716
You can talk to me.

46:20.716 --> 46:23.591
I don't want you to get
stuck here like the rest of us.

46:25.841 --> 46:29.508
When I first came here,
I was so lonely.

46:30.591 --> 46:32.508
I hid atop of the bell tower.

46:37.675 --> 46:39.591
What's in the bell tower?

46:42.300 --> 46:44.800
There are these wooden stairs
that go all the way up.

46:46.300 --> 46:48.923
And at the top,
there's this old bell

46:48.925 --> 46:51.298
with rust around the edges.

46:51.300 --> 46:54.175
And there's nothing
like the wind up there.

46:56.508 --> 46:58.758
So strong
there's nothing to stop it.

47:01.258 --> 47:03.758
Feels like it could
just pick you up and..

47:05.341 --> 47:06.800
...take you away.

47:11.925 --> 47:14.675
Bell tower's where you go when
you've got nowhere else to go.

47:19.800 --> 47:21.216
What brought you back?

47:25.300 --> 47:27.216
I didn't want to be alone.

47:38.966 --> 47:40.508
Now I'm not.

47:48.216 --> 47:50.133
I should get some rest.

49:30.383 --> 49:32.300
I know what you are.

49:34.300 --> 49:36.925
You don't belong here.

49:40.133 --> 49:41.841
She's lying to you.

49:43.133 --> 49:45.131
You're a child born out of sin.

49:45.133 --> 49:48.173
Your mother was the postulant
whore of Mercy.

49:48.175 --> 49:49.798
Excuse me.

49:49.800 --> 49:51.091
What?

49:56.216 --> 49:59.133
I will drop a hymnal
by your room before Vespers.

50:01.175 --> 50:03.341
We are singing
"Father, We Thank Thee."

50:06.008 --> 50:08.091
Or there's always a copy
in the library.

50:49.091 --> 50:51.756
Dear Frank, I'm afraid.

50:51.758 --> 50:54.964
I'm afraid of myself
and of you

50:54.966 --> 50:57.089
of this unspoken sin.

50:57.091 --> 51:00.131
These letters and the secrets
that they keep.

51:00.133 --> 51:02.923
The sisters may not see
inside my soul

51:02.925 --> 51:04.381
but the Lord does

51:04.383 --> 51:06.298
and I am afraid
of what He sees.

51:06.300 --> 51:08.256
Dear Yelena,
do you fear the fields

51:08.258 --> 51:10.173
or the wind that whisper
through them

51:10.175 --> 51:12.506
breathing life
into silent moments?

51:12.508 --> 51:15.589
They are the quiet creations
of our Lord

51:15.591 --> 51:16.881
as is this love.

51:16.883 --> 51:18.673
Would you deny a gift from God?

51:18.675 --> 51:22.214
Frank, I would never deny
my God

51:22.216 --> 51:24.464
but we took vows
that promised our lives

51:24.466 --> 51:28.214
to the Lord,
not to this sick desire.

51:28.216 --> 51:29.256
Not to this love.

51:29.258 --> 51:30.173
How could something as pure

51:30.175 --> 51:31.631
as love be other than God?

51:31.633 --> 51:34.756
What price will we pay
for betraying that promise?

51:34.758 --> 51:36.216
For denying Him?

53:13.591 --> 53:15.216
- Hello?
- Hey.

53:16.633 --> 53:18.381
It's me.

53:18.383 --> 53:21.008
I'm not supposed
to talk to you right now.

53:26.800 --> 53:30.341
- Why?
- Because you're dangerous.

53:33.508 --> 53:35.506
What's happening?

53:35.508 --> 53:37.298
Father Joseph says
we're not supposed

53:37.300 --> 53:38.381
to talk to you right now.

53:38.383 --> 53:40.381
- What are you doing in here?
- Hello?

53:40.383 --> 53:43.256
- I told you to stay out...
- I'm just talking to my mom!

53:43.258 --> 53:45.300
- Get out!
- Willow.

53:49.258 --> 53:51.258
- Willow.
- Leave Willow alone.

54:09.841 --> 54:11.383
Alyona.

55:24.925 --> 55:26.258
Can you hear me?

55:28.341 --> 55:30.133
Can you hear me?

56:03.591 --> 56:04.883
Amen.

56:25.466 --> 56:27.425
You missed morning prayers.

56:30.383 --> 56:32.383
I... I slept in.

56:36.383 --> 56:39.675
I cannot help you
if you don't join us.

56:47.050 --> 56:48.425
Come with me.

56:52.175 --> 56:53.550
That's very good.

56:54.800 --> 56:57.089
Do you have history
of mental illness

56:57.091 --> 56:58.506
in your family?

56:58.508 --> 56:59.425
No.

57:02.716 --> 57:05.506
Have you had trouble sleeping?

57:05.508 --> 57:07.756
- Yes.
- Yes.

57:07.758 --> 57:10.631
Yeah. For how long?

57:10.633 --> 57:12.881
- Always.
- Always.

57:12.883 --> 57:14.466
Please follow the eye.

57:17.216 --> 57:18.425
Okay.

57:20.258 --> 57:22.173
How old were you?

57:22.175 --> 57:24.050
- When?
- When it happened?

57:26.133 --> 57:27.550
Um, 32.

57:31.008 --> 57:32.591
Are you baptized?

57:33.716 --> 57:34.714
Yes.

57:34.716 --> 57:36.716
Have you been to the bell tower?

57:38.133 --> 57:40.050
It's okay. Answer the question.

57:42.675 --> 57:45.050
I don't know. No.

57:58.008 --> 57:59.675
What the child's name?

58:03.133 --> 58:05.008
- Willow, Why?
- No.

58:09.841 --> 58:13.133
What the child's name?

58:16.591 --> 58:17.841
Willow.

58:19.675 --> 58:21.591
Are you lying to us?

58:22.800 --> 58:23.798
No.

58:23.800 --> 58:25.381
If you lie to us

58:25.383 --> 58:27.300
then we can't help you.

59:18.591 --> 59:19.800
Amen.

59:28.175 --> 59:30.631
Can I speak with Father Joseph?

59:30.633 --> 59:32.925
I'm afraid he's left
for the day, my dear.

59:34.716 --> 59:36.716
But it's recreation hour now.

59:38.800 --> 59:41.800
Would you like to talk with me?

59:42.925 --> 59:44.633
Or perhaps..

59:48.800 --> 59:51.258
No. No, thank you.

59:59.300 --> 01:00:01.883
- I have to talk to you.
- Shh. Follow me.

01:00:17.050 --> 01:00:18.966
I think I need
to get out of here.

01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:25.091
I wanna show you something.

01:00:32.091 --> 01:00:33.425
Come on.

01:00:44.841 --> 01:00:47.673
I think I know somebody
who can help you.

01:02:05.050 --> 01:02:06.589
Hello, Madeline.

01:02:06.591 --> 01:02:08.714
Beth's a reader.

01:02:08.716 --> 01:02:10.798
She can help you.

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:12.258
Tell her.

01:02:13.966 --> 01:02:16.383
Well, she looks like
she doesn't have faith in me.

01:02:17.841 --> 01:02:19.758
So make her believe.

01:02:25.758 --> 01:02:28.508
There's more to blood
than science.

01:02:33.966 --> 01:02:35.633
I see beneath blood..

01:02:36.966 --> 01:02:39.175
...to what it tells us
about the soul.

01:02:42.966 --> 01:02:45.214
It's a very rare gift.

01:02:45.216 --> 01:02:47.048
Like yours.

01:02:47.050 --> 01:02:49.131
Are there any secrets
you need to find

01:02:49.133 --> 01:02:52.131
hiding in your soul?

01:02:52.133 --> 01:02:53.300
Hm?

01:02:55.341 --> 01:02:57.714
No, I'm okay.

01:02:57.716 --> 01:02:58.881
Oh, come on.

01:02:58.883 --> 01:03:00.800
You came here for answers,
didn't you?

01:04:03.383 --> 01:04:04.800
Your blood is thick.

01:04:06.258 --> 01:04:07.383
Clouded.

01:04:11.258 --> 01:04:12.466
Come.

01:04:16.758 --> 01:04:19.964
There are secrets and sins that
you keep even from yourself.

01:04:19.966 --> 01:04:21.341
No.

01:04:23.841 --> 01:04:25.758
You were never ready
to be a mother.

01:04:28.508 --> 01:04:30.381
You aren't here
for your daughter.

01:04:30.383 --> 01:04:32.300
You're here for yourself.

01:04:33.883 --> 01:04:35.089
Selfish.

01:04:35.091 --> 01:04:36.258
No.

01:04:40.508 --> 01:04:42.298
Let me go.

01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:44.298
I wanna stop. I wanna stop!

01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:46.006
Your blood is unholy, violated.

01:04:46.008 --> 01:04:48.423
- I wanna stop!
- Unloved.

01:04:59.341 --> 01:05:00.925
Madeline?

01:05:03.883 --> 01:05:05.798
Madeline, are you okay?

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:07.464
Look at me.

01:05:07.466 --> 01:05:09.383
Beth, what did you do to her?

01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:15.673
Madeline.

01:05:19.466 --> 01:05:21.256
Madeline?

01:05:26.175 --> 01:05:30.548
Angels bless and angels keep,
angels guard me..

01:06:09.508 --> 01:06:11.381
There you are.

01:06:11.383 --> 01:06:13.300
That was quite a fall you took.

01:06:18.091 --> 01:06:20.008
- What did they do to me?
- Drink this.

01:06:21.175 --> 01:06:23.548
It was just a foolish game

01:06:23.550 --> 01:06:26.964
those girls
are not supposed to play.

01:06:26.966 --> 01:06:27.883
Drink up.

01:06:33.383 --> 01:06:34.966
How are you feeling?

01:06:41.133 --> 01:06:44.173
I think maybe I wanna go home
for a few days.

01:06:44.175 --> 01:06:46.506
No, that wouldn't be safe.

01:06:46.508 --> 01:06:48.466
There's nasty weather coming.

01:06:50.591 --> 01:06:52.214
Then I need
to call my daughter.

01:06:52.216 --> 01:06:53.381
Of course.

01:07:04.966 --> 01:07:06.423
There's no dial tone.

01:07:06.425 --> 01:07:08.883
The weather can cause trouble.

01:07:13.758 --> 01:07:15.923
I think I'm gonna go rest
in my room.

01:07:15.925 --> 01:07:18.300
I'll send somebody for you
if the lines come back up.

01:07:26.258 --> 01:07:27.339
Don't worry, dear.

01:07:27.341 --> 01:07:29.258
Children are stronger
than you think.

01:07:32.258 --> 01:07:34.383
She'll be just fine
without you.

01:07:53.300 --> 01:07:56.091
Madeline. Madeline. Madeline.

01:08:15.383 --> 01:08:17.133
Madeline.

01:09:15.798 --> 01:09:16.841
No!

01:10:01.175 --> 01:10:02.466
Madeline!

01:10:04.632 --> 01:10:06.175
What are you doing?

01:10:07.341 --> 01:10:08.589
Leave me alone!

01:10:08.591 --> 01:10:11.423
You can't leave
in the middle of this storm!

01:10:11.425 --> 01:10:15.255
- Leave me alone!
- I'm sorry about Beth!

01:10:15.257 --> 01:10:17.175
I thought she could help you!

01:10:18.216 --> 01:10:20.133
I know about your parents!

01:10:22.257 --> 01:10:25.089
I know about everything!

01:10:25.091 --> 01:10:28.214
I know what's going on
with you!

01:10:28.216 --> 01:10:31.091
I can help you
save your daughter!

01:10:51.050 --> 01:10:52.341
Madeline!

01:11:00.466 --> 01:11:02.839
Let me save you!

01:11:02.841 --> 01:11:04.714
Please!

01:11:04.716 --> 01:11:06.466
Let me save you!

01:11:36.841 --> 01:11:39.425
Here, you need
to wrap yourself in this.

01:11:42.382 --> 01:11:44.382
Why are they taking my daughter?

01:11:46.007 --> 01:11:48.965
I heard Mother Superior
talking with Father Joseph.

01:11:50.507 --> 01:11:53.382
Your family planned all this
just to send you away.

01:11:55.300 --> 01:11:59.216
That letter magically turning up
out of the blue.

01:12:04.341 --> 01:12:07.258
Father Joseph turning up
at your house.

01:12:09.091 --> 01:12:12.464
They wanted to abandon you here.

01:12:12.466 --> 01:12:14.341
They think
that you're dangerous.

01:12:18.550 --> 01:12:20.300
Then why did you stop me?

01:12:25.466 --> 01:12:27.383
'Cause you would have frozen
to death.

01:12:43.216 --> 01:12:45.714
You can't go home.

01:12:45.716 --> 01:12:47.883
You're stuck here just like me.

01:12:52.175 --> 01:12:54.589
Everyone is afraid of you.

01:12:54.591 --> 01:12:56.425
Your daughter's afraid of you.

01:12:57.757 --> 01:12:59.882
They don't want you
to come back.

01:13:03.550 --> 01:13:05.882
Why do they think I'm dangerous?

01:13:09.216 --> 01:13:11.133
Because you are..

01:13:22.007 --> 01:13:24.090
- What's wrong?
- I have to go.

01:13:40.632 --> 01:13:42.005
Hello?

01:13:42.007 --> 01:13:43.882
She's lying to you.

01:13:51.841 --> 01:13:53.716
Your daughter needs you.

01:14:11.091 --> 01:14:13.008
You must go to the bell tower.

01:14:22.425 --> 01:14:24.507
The key is in the well.

01:14:32.632 --> 01:14:34.465
You will find what you need..

01:14:36.257 --> 01:14:38.300
...if you look deep enough.

01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:45.925
You have to go back in.

01:14:47.257 --> 01:14:49.257
It's the only way out.

01:16:20.466 --> 01:16:21.800
I'm coming, Willow.

01:16:54.300 --> 01:16:55.675
Mommy!

01:16:57.882 --> 01:17:00.090
I'm coming. I'm coming.

01:17:34.050 --> 01:17:35.216
There are..

01:17:36.632 --> 01:17:39.840
...things I wanted to tell you.

01:19:03.425 --> 01:19:04.757
Madeline.

01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:15.050
I never wanted this for you.

01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:21.091
I never wanted any of this.

01:19:25.382 --> 01:19:26.715
Mother.

01:19:29.966 --> 01:19:31.550
It was just love.

01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:34.216
That's all it was.

01:19:35.882 --> 01:19:37.675
But it should never have been.

01:19:46.507 --> 01:19:48.050
And we struggled.

01:19:49.966 --> 01:19:51.716
My God, we struggled.

01:19:54.007 --> 01:19:56.005
How could something
so pure as love

01:19:56.007 --> 01:19:58.175
be something other than God?

01:19:59.341 --> 01:20:00.925
But it was forbidden.

01:20:02.175 --> 01:20:04.300
We followed our desires..

01:20:05.591 --> 01:20:07.383
...and broke our vows.

01:20:09.841 --> 01:20:13.300
We ran towards love
and away from God.

01:20:20.550 --> 01:20:22.050
We were selfish.

01:20:26.632 --> 01:20:30.465
We invited unholiness
into our lives.

01:20:49.382 --> 01:20:52.089
Stay where you are.
Stay where you are.

01:21:10.966 --> 01:21:14.800
Some of the consequences
were impossible to bear.

01:21:16.216 --> 01:21:19.883
Others were true blessings.

01:21:23.050 --> 01:21:24.591
Like you.

01:21:30.882 --> 01:21:32.882
But it wasn't always like this.

01:21:39.091 --> 01:21:40.880
I have memories of him.

01:21:48.382 --> 01:21:49.675
Come on.

01:21:51.675 --> 01:21:53.550
We had a burden to bear.

01:21:58.216 --> 01:22:00.216
So for as long as possible..

01:22:03.007 --> 01:22:05.132
...we shared that burden.

01:23:10.841 --> 01:23:14.130
We did everything we could
to keep this from you.

01:23:14.132 --> 01:23:17.923
We took every step we could
to live like this.

01:23:56.050 --> 01:23:58.089
Madeline.

01:23:58.091 --> 01:24:00.383
We thought we could control it.

01:24:02.091 --> 01:24:03.633
Madeline!

01:24:13.050 --> 01:24:15.050
We were wrong.

01:24:19.300 --> 01:24:23.757
One day, it got away
from both of us..

01:24:27.257 --> 01:24:29.175
...and it got the thing..

01:24:31.175 --> 01:24:34.257
...that it wanted more than us.

01:24:36.466 --> 01:24:37.675
Me.

01:24:40.925 --> 01:24:42.425
It wanted me.

01:26:20.175 --> 01:26:22.425
Yelena, please come back.

01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:27.591
I warned you not to go
to the bell tower.

01:26:29.425 --> 01:26:31.341
But you did it, anyway.

01:26:35.175 --> 01:26:37.175
That's no way
to treat a friend.

01:26:42.841 --> 01:26:44.966
And now you're here.

01:26:51.257 --> 01:26:53.257
Your parents abandoned you.

01:26:58.216 --> 01:27:00.258
God abandoned you.

01:27:03.591 --> 01:27:06.925
They didn't want
to protect you.

01:27:10.257 --> 01:27:11.675
I took you in..

01:27:13.382 --> 01:27:16.380
...an unloved, discarded child

01:27:16.382 --> 01:27:18.589
born of pure sin.

01:27:18.591 --> 01:27:20.258
I made you blessed.

01:27:23.966 --> 01:27:26.255
You can't escape, Madeline.

01:27:26.257 --> 01:27:28.257
There's only one way out.

01:27:50.216 --> 01:27:52.425
Don't you remember
what they did to you?

01:27:53.757 --> 01:27:55.882
Don't you remember
what you are?

01:28:01.507 --> 01:28:06.048
There are no answers at the
bottom of that well, Madeline.

01:28:06.050 --> 01:28:08.005
- Frank.
- There's only one thing down there.

01:28:08.007 --> 01:28:10.132
- Frank, no!
- You!

01:28:35.050 --> 01:28:36.632
Don't you remember?

01:28:39.925 --> 01:28:42.007
I can protect you.

01:28:46.757 --> 01:28:48.590
But you're dangerous..

01:28:49.882 --> 01:28:53.255
...and the only way
to save Willow

01:28:53.257 --> 01:28:55.175
is to come with me.

01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:41.175
Let's get off this island.

01:29:56.716 --> 01:29:59.048
Mommy!

01:30:04.841 --> 01:30:06.300
Mommy!

01:30:24.591 --> 01:30:26.425
Willow needs you.

01:30:27.716 --> 01:30:29.466
She loves you.

01:30:55.591 --> 01:30:57.298
Mommy.

01:30:57.300 --> 01:30:59.173
Can you hear me?

01:31:01.382 --> 01:31:03.839
Please, look at me.

01:31:03.841 --> 01:31:06.005
Please, look at me.

01:31:07.591 --> 01:31:08.798
She loves you.

01:31:10.257 --> 01:31:12.630
She loves you.

01:31:12.632 --> 01:31:14.382
She loves you.

01:31:23.550 --> 01:31:25.630
Willow needs you.

01:31:25.632 --> 01:31:26.673
She loves you.

01:31:38.591 --> 01:31:41.464
I couldn't protect you.
I regret..

01:31:46.507 --> 01:31:49.464
You're not leaving this time.

01:31:49.466 --> 01:31:52.380
Your soul belongs to me.

01:31:52.382 --> 01:31:54.798
To me.

01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:56.005
Your soul belongs to me!

01:31:58.882 --> 01:32:01.632
Your soul belongs to me!

01:32:03.632 --> 01:32:06.175
Your soul belongs to me!

01:32:07.091 --> 01:32:09.591
Your soul belongs to me!

01:32:19.425 --> 01:32:20.466
Madeline.

01:32:36.091 --> 01:32:38.048
Listen to me.

01:32:41.550 --> 01:32:44.632
I don't regret breaking my vows.

01:32:45.757 --> 01:32:50.005
I don't regret having you.

01:32:51.925 --> 01:32:54.298
I was wrong.

01:32:54.300 --> 01:32:58.175
You should have never
had to suffer for my sins.

01:32:59.425 --> 01:33:02.630
Please give it back to me.

01:33:02.632 --> 01:33:03.840
Please.

01:34:20.632 --> 01:34:21.965
Yelena.

01:34:42.216 --> 01:34:43.758
Yelena.

01:34:45.050 --> 01:34:47.673
Yelena. Ye...

01:35:18.050 --> 01:35:22.882
I will always be here
to protect you, my child.

01:35:56.925 --> 01:35:58.841
Thank you, Lord..

01:36:00.675 --> 01:36:02.175
...for light..

01:36:03.591 --> 01:36:04.883
...for strength..

01:36:05.966 --> 01:36:07.091
...and..

01:36:08.257 --> 01:36:09.757
...forgiveness.

01:36:42.841 --> 01:36:47.380
He is so grateful for a chance
to be a family with you again.

01:36:47.382 --> 01:36:49.880
Your parents
have always loved you.

01:36:49.882 --> 01:36:52.132
- You know this.
- I do now.

01:36:55.882 --> 01:36:59.425
Then you are truly blessed.

01:37:36.007 --> 01:37:37.590
Let's go home.

01:38:06.507 --> 01:38:09.007
We made it, right? Good?

01:38:11.757 --> 01:38:13.882
How this... made it.

01:39:20.841 --> 01:39:22.133
Come with me.

01:39:29.093 --> 01:39:34.093
