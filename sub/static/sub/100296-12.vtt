WEBVTT

00:01.040 --> 00:03.429
Previously onDeputy...

00:03.480 --> 00:05.732
There's no more space
for men like you.

00:05.780 --> 00:08.123
Not in this city, and certainly
not in this election.

00:08.180 --> 00:11.081
People don't want a gunslinger
in this office.

00:11.140 --> 00:12.357
Get out.

00:12.400 --> 00:14.789
Today I announce my candidacy

00:14.840 --> 00:17.001
for sheriff
of Los Angeles County.

00:17.060 --> 00:18.573
MINNICK:
A deputy was shot yesterday.

00:18.620 --> 00:20.440
I'm Luna's informant.

00:20.490 --> 00:22.367
SOCIAL WORKER:
I am obligated to inform you

00:22.410 --> 00:25.140
that Roberto and Camilla's
maternal grandmother

00:25.190 --> 00:26.794
has filed for custody.

00:26.850 --> 00:28.932
Oh, you have gotten so big!

00:28.980 --> 00:31.494
Grandma said we're gonna see her
all the time now. Is that okay?

00:31.550 --> 00:33.324
I can't let this happen.

00:33.380 --> 00:35.154
-I'm not gonna.
-BILL: Hey, honey.

00:35.200 --> 00:36.371
-PAULA [on phone]:
There's a shooter.
-Where's the gunman?

00:36.420 --> 00:38.809
You! Get off the phone, now!

00:38.860 --> 00:40.031
BILL [on phone]: Paula!

00:43.910 --> 00:46.606
I'm not exactly
a philosophical guy.

00:46.650 --> 00:48.698
I take things as they are.

00:48.740 --> 00:51.208
Once you start thinkin'
about how they oughta be,

00:51.260 --> 00:53.865
well, that's
dangerous territory.

00:53.920 --> 00:56.434
Especially for a lawman.

00:56.490 --> 00:58.390
But then there's
the other side of it.

01:00.140 --> 01:02.608
Now I've had plenty to say
about this department,

01:02.670 --> 01:05.628
where it is now,
where it's headed.

01:05.670 --> 01:07.843
But there's ten million people
in this county.

01:07.890 --> 01:10.279
Maybe it's time
for them to speak.

01:10.330 --> 01:12.548
Let the chips fall
where they may.

01:22.900 --> 01:24.720
[footsteps approaching]

01:30.520 --> 01:31.691
PAULA: What?

01:33.180 --> 01:35.216
You said you had
a handle on this.

01:38.480 --> 01:40.528
-Pau|a.
-I know. I heard you.

01:42.620 --> 01:43.962
I'm just tired and annoyed.

01:44.660 --> 01:45.706
I haven't slept.

01:47.230 --> 01:50.017
And I've tried everything,
I've tried therapy, meds...

01:50.710 --> 01:51.756
exercise.

01:52.240 --> 01:53.628
BILL: Honey.

01:54.330 --> 01:57.106
You are one of the top
three surgeons in California.

01:58.240 --> 02:00.322
Taking some time off
won't change that.

02:01.590 --> 02:03.285
I appreciate you saying that.

02:03.340 --> 02:05.410
That's not an option.
Not with all the drama

02:05.470 --> 02:06.721
that I've just had
with the funding.

02:08.430 --> 02:09.465
Okay.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.217
I'm here if you need me.

[exhales]

02:42.160 --> 02:43.673
So does everyone
get a beach shift

02:43.720 --> 02:45.369
at the end of training
or only the best?

02:45.420 --> 02:46.500
Only mine.

02:47.810 --> 02:48.890
I came up with
the watch commander down here.

02:48.950 --> 02:50.508
We have a little
exchange program.

02:52.860 --> 02:54.293
You know, I think
you're gonna miss me.

02:55.210 --> 02:57.906
Maybe we should head back
to Lennox so you can focus.

02:57.960 --> 03:00.861
Maybe we should hit the beach
after our shift.

03:00.910 --> 03:03.083
-You brought
your bikini with you?
-You wish.

-Wow.

-Stay down.
-MAN: I didn't do anything.

04:20.340 --> 04:21.648
I was checking on Raymond.

04:21.690 --> 04:22.736
I live in the backhouse.

04:22.780 --> 04:23.860
You gotta help him.
He's hurt.

Morning, mija.

05:03.210 --> 05:04.427

05:04.470 --> 05:06.518
Your daughter is growing
and she needs to--

05:06.560 --> 05:07.640
No. Cooking.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.218
-Mags, you ready for today?
-Nope.

05:11.260 --> 05:12.864
Good. Neither am I.
[chuckles]

05:13.440 --> 05:15.476
There he is.
Man of the hour.

05:16.140 --> 05:18.040
[sighs]
If you say so, Jorge.

05:18.660 --> 05:20.093
-BILL: Morning.
-Good morning.

05:22.140 --> 05:23.573
This is a good time to announce.

05:23.620 --> 05:25.144
I trust your judgment.

05:25.190 --> 05:26.623
JORGE: Incumbent always
has the advantage

05:26.670 --> 05:27.705
in the sheriff's race.

05:28.240 --> 05:29.275
Name recognition.

05:30.410 --> 05:32.492
Technically, the incumbent died.

05:32.540 --> 05:33.939
True.

05:34.760 --> 05:36.159
You know,
Bradford came to me.

05:37.160 --> 05:39.321
-Few weeks
before it happened.
-For what?

05:40.070 --> 05:41.378
The Latino vote.

05:41.420 --> 05:42.682
BILL:
And what did you tell him?

05:42.730 --> 05:44.072
Learn Spanish.

05:47.430 --> 05:48.818
I told him to open up.

05:48.870 --> 05:50.121
Be accessible.

05:51.170 --> 05:53.388
That's why I set up
this interview today.

05:54.480 --> 05:55.515
But you're the expert.

05:58.270 --> 06:00.784
I'm just curious what
you all might say about me.

06:00.830 --> 06:02.559
Nothing we wouldn't say
to your face.

06:02.620 --> 06:03.962
Speak for yourself.

06:04.010 --> 06:05.227
[chuckles]

06:06.750 --> 06:08.354
It's the LA Times.

06:08.800 --> 06:11.234
Them having access
to the sitting sheriff
and his family,

06:11.280 --> 06:12.929
it's a big story.

06:12.980 --> 06:14.971
They'll play nice.

06:15.020 --> 06:17.068
And we have something
to humanize you

06:17.630 --> 06:18.847
when we launch the campaign.

06:18.900 --> 06:20.458
Didn't know
I needed humanizing.

06:20.510 --> 06:22.068
JORGE: You're larger
than life, Bill.

06:22.120 --> 06:24.680
So we show 'em
your heart, your family.

06:25.120 --> 06:27.634
And then, with your speech,
you show the people

06:27.690 --> 06:29.112
that Bill Hollister
IS an Angeleno,

06:29.170 --> 06:30.239
through and through.

06:30.730 --> 06:32.288
When they vote for you,

06:32.340 --> 06:34.035
they are voting for themselves.

06:35.170 --> 06:36.216
That's how we win.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.698
Well, the speeches I don't mind.

06:39.740 --> 06:41.048
It's the glad handing.

06:41.870 --> 06:43.303
The gold digging.

06:43.350 --> 06:45.352
I don't want anyone thinking
I owe them a favor.

06:47.790 --> 06:49.838
[indistinct radio chatter]

06:54.230 --> 06:56.448
All right, who are you?

06:56.500 --> 06:57.626
Why were you in the house?

06:58.060 --> 07:00.016
Corey Kemp.
I rent the guest house.

07:00.500 --> 07:02.058
Hadn't seen Raymond in days.

07:02.110 --> 07:03.805
His car didn't move.
I got worried.

07:03.850 --> 07:05.283
Why didn't you just call us?

07:05.330 --> 07:06.763
I don't know. I just...

07:06.810 --> 07:08.505
I thought I should see
if he was in trouble first.

07:08.550 --> 07:10.552
Anyone else come by the house
the last few days?

07:10.600 --> 07:11.988
Any suspicious activity?

07:13.520 --> 07:15.078
I heard him having a fight
with someone in the house

07:15.130 --> 07:16.074
a couple days ago.

07:16.130 --> 07:17.518
It was pretty heated.

07:17.560 --> 07:18.606
With who?

07:20.910 --> 07:22.389
I don't know who you think
you're protecting,

07:22.440 --> 07:24.783
but I suggest you
watch your own ass.

07:24.830 --> 07:27.788
Minnick,
I found the vic's cell phone.

07:27.830 --> 07:30.355
Thirty-two missed calls
from Oliver.

07:31.010 --> 07:33.001
That's his son.
You should talk to him.

07:34.060 --> 07:35.573
Yeah, thank you.

07:37.630 --> 07:41.100
Also, a bunch of texts
and missed calls from Becca.

07:41.540 --> 07:43.064
I don't know who she is.

07:44.890 --> 07:46.061
You said that real fast.

07:48.290 --> 07:49.678
Go make yourselves useful.

07:55.030 --> 07:56.679
You sure you don't know Becca?

08:01.520 --> 08:03.829
That wasn't bad
for your first attempt.

08:03.870 --> 08:05.519
I couldn't even stand up.

08:05.570 --> 08:08.130
Well, neither could I
my first go.

08:08.660 --> 08:09.695
Hey, come here.

08:10.960 --> 08:13.133
Listen, it's not about
standing up

08:13.180 --> 08:14.351
your first time on a board,

08:14.400 --> 08:16.265
or even your second
or your third.

08:16.320 --> 08:18.276
It's about feeling the waves,

08:18.320 --> 08:20.754
getting to know the water
and understanding its power.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.529
You call that water knowledge.

08:22.580 --> 08:25.401
If you don't respect the ocean,
it'll take you down.

08:28.850 --> 08:30.363
What's up, kiddo?

08:32.290 --> 08:33.894
We don't wanna
live with grandma.

worry about that, okay?

08:47.780 --> 08:48.906
Leave that to me and Teresa

08:48.960 --> 08:50.382
'cause we're gonna fight
tooth and nail

08:50.440 --> 08:52.431
to have you guys
keep living with us.

08:52.480 --> 08:54.084
You wanna know why?

08:56.400 --> 08:57.526
'Cause we're a family.

08:58.360 --> 08:59.793
And nothing's gonna change that.

09:01.190 --> 09:02.225
Nothing.

09:04.580 --> 09:05.660
Bring it in.

09:21.640 --> 09:23.688

clear the last time.

09:23.730 --> 09:24.810
RILEY: We need to talk.

09:25.260 --> 09:27.421
You drop your
phony investigation yet?

09:27.470 --> 09:28.516
Give me a reason.

09:28.910 --> 09:30.081
I shouldn't have to.

09:30.870 --> 09:32.997
I know you're announcing
your run for sheriff.

09:34.310 --> 09:36.266
Are you sure
that's what you want?

09:37.220 --> 09:39.176
Have you asked yourself
the same question?

09:41.270 --> 09:43.443
Keep handing out deals
to corrupt cops

09:43.490 --> 09:46.141
then try walking down
the street in South LA.

09:46.190 --> 09:48.579
Or even getting
a dinner reservation
on Bunker Hill.

09:48.630 --> 09:51.622
I'd rather be effective
than popular.

09:51.670 --> 09:54.104
Sorry, Carol.
That's my brand.

10:01.680 --> 10:03.500

10:03.550 --> 10:05.552
Hasn't made a call in two days.

10:05.600 --> 10:06.771
Oh. [sighs]

10:06.820 --> 10:09.129
Corey wouldn't be
stupid enough to do this

10:09.170 --> 10:11.684
and hang around
for two days,
then break in.

10:11.740 --> 10:13.082
I don't know.

10:13.130 --> 10:14.734

seem like an intellectual.

Well, let's meet the kids.

10:19.480 --> 10:20.788
WOMAN:
Can we make this quick?

10:20.830 --> 10:22.263
We should be with our dad
at the hospital.

10:22.310 --> 10:23.709
MINNICK:
I understand.

10:23.750 --> 10:25.263
The more you tell us,
the quicker this goes.

10:25.320 --> 10:26.708
What happened?

10:26.750 --> 10:29.446
We think your father
was pushed down the stairs.

10:31.230 --> 10:32.367
Becca.

10:32.410 --> 10:33.923
-I knew it.
-OLIVER: Oh, come on.

10:33.980 --> 10:36.369
She's a lot of things,
she's not a killer.

10:36.810 --> 10:38.198
He's not dead yet.

10:38.240 --> 10:39.628
Who's Becca?

10:39.680 --> 10:41.500
He has missed calls
and texts from her.

10:41.900 --> 10:44.505
His... girlfriend.

10:44.550 --> 10:47.110
She just so happens to be
younger than both of us.

10:47.160 --> 10:48.502
Did they fight a lot?

10:48.560 --> 10:49.948

I couldn't tell you.

10:49.990 --> 10:51.810
I refused to visit
when she was there.

10:51.860 --> 10:53.464
How long have
they been together?

10:53.520 --> 10:54.862
OLIVER: Two years.

10:54.910 --> 10:56.423

an intervention,

10:56.480 --> 10:58.254
-get Dad to end it.
-But what do we know?

10:58.300 --> 10:59.858
We're only his
flesh and blood.

10:59.920 --> 11:02.343
We wanted to protect him
and his money.

11:02.870 --> 11:04.428
Tenant out back said
he heard Raymond fighting

11:04.480 --> 11:05.879
with a woman yesterday.

11:06.440 --> 11:08.613
Corey? He's probably
spying on them.

11:09.140 --> 11:10.357
Why do you say that?

11:10.400 --> 11:12.664
[scoffs]
I mean... Come on.

11:14.710 --> 11:16.018
He's a little off.

11:16.800 --> 11:18.404
REAGAN:
It wouldn't be the first time.

11:19.060 --> 11:20.675
You should definitely
talk to Becca.

11:20.720 --> 11:22.142
Do you have an address?

11:22.200 --> 11:24.714
Uh, all I know is that

11:24.770 --> 11:26.988
she lives in an apartment
near the airport.

11:27.900 --> 11:30.630
I'm sensing a little tension
between you and your father.

11:30.690 --> 11:31.679
[scoffs]

11:34.780 --> 11:37.340
We'll be in touch
in the next few days, okay?

11:37.390 --> 11:38.425
Great.

11:40.780 --> 11:42.122
The point of the story

11:42.170 --> 11:44.991
is to put a human side
to Sheriff Hollister.

11:45.050 --> 11:46.915
We wanna know
the man behind the badge.

11:47.570 --> 11:49.561
The father. The husband.
The son-in-law.

11:49.620 --> 11:52.748
Bill Hollister is real,
that's what you need to know.

11:52.790 --> 11:54.792
He's the only person
we trust with our daughter.

11:54.840 --> 11:56.831
Even after what happened
at the prison?

11:56.890 --> 11:59.404
Your daughter was held hostage
because of the sheriff.

11:59.890 --> 12:01.619
That's not even fair.

12:01.670 --> 12:04.104
You can't blame Dad
for what bad people do.

12:04.980 --> 12:06.584
Any implication
that our lives

12:06.630 --> 12:09.064
have been negatively affected
by Bill's choices

12:13.120 --> 12:14.633
We all make sacrifices.

12:14.690 --> 12:16.555
That's what public service
is about.

12:16.600 --> 12:19.160
That's why he's sheriff.
That's why he will stay sheriff.

12:20.870 --> 12:22.770
JORGE: Would you like
some more coffee?

12:22.820 --> 12:24.549
REPORTER: Yes, please.
Thank you.

12:27.350 --> 12:29.170
[cell phone ringing]

12:31.440 --> 12:32.782
JOSEPH: Hey.

12:33.400 --> 12:35.004
Wow, that was fast, yeah.

12:35.450 --> 12:37.793
Send it to me.
Okay.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.057
What's up?

12:39.100 --> 12:40.408
We're up on Becca's phone.

12:40.450 --> 12:41.838
MINNICK: Oh, great.

12:45.150 --> 12:47.368
I remember the first time
I took you to school.

12:47.410 --> 12:48.752
Kindergarten.

12:49.420 --> 12:51.581
I don't, thank God.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.119
All the other kids
they were crying,

12:53.160 --> 12:55.025
refusing to go in
but not you.

12:55.730 --> 12:57.072
You just gave me
a kiss on the cheek

12:57.120 --> 12:58.769
and told me not to worry.

12:58.820 --> 12:59.809
Ha.

13:01.780 --> 13:02.940
And then I started crying.

13:05.260 --> 13:06.477
You okay, Mom?

13:08.090 --> 13:10.217
-Yeah, I'm fine.
-Really?

13:10.260 --> 13:12.820
'Cause both abuelaand I
are worried about you.

13:14.140 --> 13:15.744
There is nothing to worry about.

13:17.100 --> 13:18.783
I thought we didn't lie
to each other.

13:22.710 --> 13:24.484
I just can't get her face
out of my head.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.398
Did you do
the breathing exercises?

13:29.500 --> 13:31.058
Yeah, they're not
working anymore.

13:31.110 --> 13:32.543
What did Dr. Hake say?

13:32.590 --> 13:34.455
That I have to face my fears.

13:34.500 --> 13:36.718
Well, you don't have to alone.

13:36.770 --> 13:39.238
You've got me. And Dad.

13:39.990 --> 13:42.424
Yeah, well, I don't have myself
right now and it pisses me off.

13:44.300 --> 13:45.460
[sighs deeply]

13:47.690 --> 13:50.477
I'm so proud of you.
I am.

13:50.520 --> 13:52.693
You've been through so much
these past few months

13:52.740 --> 13:54.219
and the way that
you've handled everything

13:54.260 --> 13:57.434
it just really shows
the woman that you're becoming.

13:58.140 --> 13:59.823
Yeah, it took me a minute
to understand

13:59.880 --> 14:02.178
but I get it now.

14:03.530 --> 14:04.576
I need Dad...

14:06.750 --> 14:08.149
so does LA County.

14:09.890 --> 14:11.790
I guess we're just gonna
have to learn to share.

14:18.680 --> 14:20.284
MINNICK:
She still inside?

14:20.330 --> 14:21.410
JOSEPH: Yeah.

14:21.860 --> 14:23.157
MINNICK:
She's taking her time.

14:30.130 --> 14:31.165
Here we go.

14:38.610 --> 14:39.736
[siren chirps]

14:43.920 --> 14:44.909
Becca?

14:46.270 --> 14:48.226
I paid for everything
this time, relax.

14:48.270 --> 14:50.921
Uh, actually we're here
about Raymond.

14:51.410 --> 14:53.833
-What about Raymond?
-There was an incident.

14:53.890 --> 14:55.494
Wait, what are you
talking about?

14:57.330 --> 14:59.491
BECCA: Raymond found me
at just the right time.

14:59.550 --> 15:02.587
I'd been sleeping in my car,
doing what I could for money.

15:02.640 --> 15:03.709
He never judged.

15:03.770 --> 15:05.283
Seems like his kids might.

15:06.550 --> 15:08.074
I get it.
I'm younger than them.

15:08.120 --> 15:10.372
But that doesn't change
the way I feel about Ray.

15:11.470 --> 15:12.903
If the same thing
happened to my dad,

15:12.950 --> 15:14.201
I don't know what I'd do.

15:14.260 --> 15:16.899
But not throw an intervention,
I know that.

15:17.430 --> 15:18.988
Oh, you heard about that, huh?

15:20.040 --> 15:21.826
There's nothing
Raymond doesn't tell me.

15:22.440 --> 15:23.862
And I can't exactly be mad.

15:23.920 --> 15:25.000
If they hadn't have done that,

15:25.050 --> 15:26.529
we would've _
never gotten married.

15:27.010 --> 15:28.170
Wait, you're married?

15:28.970 --> 15:31.131
In the living room
in our bathrobes.

15:31.970 --> 15:34.962
Raymond made a few calls
and someone was over
the same night.

15:35.020 --> 15:36.829
But I thought you had
an apartment across town.

15:36.890 --> 15:38.403
I... Ido.

15:40.110 --> 15:42.544
I'm not stupid.
I know what this looks like.

15:42.590 --> 15:44.364
Young woman.
Older, rich man.

15:45.030 --> 15:47.112
I demanded I keep my place
and we signed a prenup

15:47.160 --> 15:49.674
'cause I never wanted anyone
questioning my intentions.

15:50.420 --> 15:53.071
Did you get into an argument
with Raymond that afternoon?

15:55.080 --> 15:56.638
No, that was Reagan.

15:57.820 --> 15:58.991
His daughter?

15:59.040 --> 16:01.122
Yeah, she found out
we were married

16:01.170 --> 16:02.774
and she got pretty upset.

16:04.870 --> 16:05.950
She didn't tell you?

16:06.570 --> 16:08.606
No, it must have
slipped her mind.

16:16.410 --> 16:18.275
[indistinct chatter]

16:24.540 --> 16:25.848
CADE: What happened?

16:25.890 --> 16:27.232
Jogger found the body
early this morning.

16:29.510 --> 16:31.023
We're still canvassing,
but nothing yet.

16:31.070 --> 16:32.150
Thank you, Deputy.

16:32.200 --> 16:33.542
So what's up?
Why are we here?

16:33.600 --> 16:34.760
When Homicide comes in,

16:34.810 --> 16:36.072
I like to run it
through the system.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.985
-Just in case.
-You do love your homework.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.519
BISHOP: So did this guy.

16:39.560 --> 16:40.993
He was a CI.

16:41.040 --> 16:42.200
Is he one of ours?

16:42.260 --> 16:43.864
Actually he was yours.

16:58.190 --> 16:59.999
All right.
You got my number.

17:01.060 --> 17:02.220
Okay, thanks.

17:03.580 --> 17:06.048
Well, nobody can tell me
when he went missing,

17:06.110 --> 17:07.714
where he was living, nothin'.

17:08.590 --> 17:09.978
Which means everything.

17:10.020 --> 17:11.669
That many people clam up,
they know something,

17:11.720 --> 17:12.709
that's for damn sure.

17:12.770 --> 17:14.067
Well, who was he?

17:14.120 --> 17:15.417
Jeffrey Williams.

17:16.070 --> 17:18.504
Ran guns for Excise Seven
until his son got shot

17:18.550 --> 17:20.632
seventeen times
by a rIval gang.

17:21.120 --> 17:22.428
And then he turned informant.

17:22.470 --> 17:24.597
You know I put a lot
of bad dudes behind bars

17:24.650 --> 17:25.639
because of Jeffrey.

17:25.690 --> 17:26.907
Back in my Pentagon days,

17:26.950 --> 17:28.087
someone gets
offed liked that,

17:28.130 --> 17:29.256
they're an example
for everyone else

17:29.300 --> 17:30.779
not to go rogue.

17:30.830 --> 17:32.650
It's a tricky thing
about the path to redemption,

17:32.700 --> 17:34.691
a lot of people won't let you
climb out of that gutter.

17:35.270 --> 17:36.396
Where do we look first?

17:36.440 --> 17:37.953
Oh, I got an idea,

17:38.010 --> 17:39.739
but I'm gonna need
the sheriff's help first.

17:41.660 --> 17:42.706
You all right?

17:43.450 --> 17:44.701
Yeah.

17:44.750 --> 17:46.445
Not gonna lie, this one
hurts a little bit,

17:46.500 --> 17:47.967
but I got something
I need to handle

17:48.020 --> 17:49.237
-on the personal side, too.
-[cell phone buzzing]

17:50.190 --> 17:51.839
Oh, speaking of personal.

17:51.890 --> 17:52.936
No.

17:53.630 --> 17:55.678
Oh, come on, Bish,
give me the dish.

17:55.720 --> 17:57.028
Fine.

17:57.070 --> 17:58.287
Julie works with Dr. Reyes

17:58.330 --> 17:59.888
and is helping me
find an apartment,

17:59.940 --> 18:02.329
which is proving difficult
on a single deputy's salary.

18:02.380 --> 18:03.859
Ooh, and maybe
she needs a roommate?

18:03.900 --> 18:05.777
Hmm. This is me walking away.

18:05.820 --> 18:07.071
-[chuckles]
-Hey!

18:09.040 --> 18:11.429
Hey, Bill,
I have a favor to ask.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.080
You need a trim?

18:14.610 --> 18:16.430
MAN: Hey, Sheriff.
How you doin' today?

18:16.480 --> 18:19.085
BILL: Thanks, guys.
Jacob?

18:20.090 --> 18:21.136
OI' Curtis.

18:22.620 --> 18:24.485
Well, if it isn't the sheriff
of Los Angeles County.

18:27.410 --> 18:29.014
You know Jeffrey Williams?

18:29.060 --> 18:30.277
That's Bobby's boy.

18:30.320 --> 18:31.708
Heard he caught a bad break.

18:32.410 --> 18:34.878
-You know why?
-Word on the street is

18:34.930 --> 18:37.319
he found a better deal
with the competition.

18:38.420 --> 18:40.672
Management must not have been
too happy about that, huh?

18:40.720 --> 18:42.119
No, sir.

18:42.160 --> 18:44.060
They made it clear
he understood that.

18:44.120 --> 18:45.371
Crystal.

18:46.420 --> 18:47.591
Appreciate it.

18:47.640 --> 18:48.982
MAYOR:
When you announcing?

18:51.520 --> 18:52.999
Tomorrow actually.

18:53.950 --> 18:55.554
It's about damn time.

18:55.610 --> 18:58.249
Everyone keeps tellin' me
I gotta become a politician.

18:58.960 --> 19:00.257
You know I can't do that.

19:00.790 --> 19:02.269
You already are, Bill.

19:02.310 --> 19:04.005
Just not the kind
they're used to.

19:04.790 --> 19:06.439
Everyone's supposed
to be this or that.

19:06.490 --> 19:07.969
Left or right.

19:08.010 --> 19:10.137
You've never been
anything but Bill.

19:10.670 --> 19:12.319
That's why you're gonna win.

19:13.410 --> 19:15.105
Thanks for the confidence.

19:17.190 --> 19:18.532
I'll see ya.

19:18.590 --> 19:19.887
Yes, sir.

19:19.940 --> 19:20.929
BILL: Cade.

19:20.980 --> 19:22.584
You were right.

19:22.630 --> 19:24.803
It was Williams' own people
who did that to him.

19:24.850 --> 19:27.762
They were sendin' a message
not to play both sides.

19:27.810 --> 19:29.687
[gunshots]

19:37.300 --> 19:38.733
Interesting place
for a meeting.

19:40.870 --> 19:43.430
Well, I had already had
too much coffee today, so...

19:45.700 --> 19:46.746
What's this about?

19:47.400 --> 19:49.743
I saw you lurking around
my fundraiser.

19:49.790 --> 19:52.099
What, you doing
some oppo research?

19:52.140 --> 19:54.279
No, I like to think of myself
as an informed voter.

19:54.320 --> 19:55.708
And I wanted to see

19:55.750 --> 19:57.752
what a Carol Riley
administration might look like.

19:58.450 --> 19:59.758
What'd you learn?

20:00.460 --> 20:02.234
You've genuine concern
for the county

20:02.280 --> 20:03.884
with an unparalleled
conviction rate.

20:04.760 --> 20:05.840
Your peers respect you.

20:05.900 --> 20:07.231
Some of them fear you.

20:07.720 --> 20:08.937
The men do.

20:10.070 --> 20:12.072
I did some research
on you, too.

20:12.120 --> 20:14.554
Army intelligence.
Time at the pentagon.

20:14.600 --> 20:16.648
Some private contracting.

20:17.950 --> 20:20.680
And you did the whole
whistleblower thing
before it was cool.

20:20.740 --> 20:22.389
Some pretty thorough research.

20:23.480 --> 20:24.731
It's what I do.

20:27.740 --> 20:30.652
Sheriff Hollister isn't like
the men you so clearly resent.

20:31.620 --> 20:33.781
His character is what
serves him best in this job

20:33.840 --> 20:35.398
and now that you know
my history,

20:35.450 --> 20:36.872
you'll know I like an insurgent.

20:37.880 --> 20:39.575
I don't need your vote,
Bishop,

20:40.100 --> 20:41.704
but after I win,

20:42.320 --> 20:44.322
I do hope I can
earn your respect.

21:06.350 --> 21:07.567
If you win.

21:18.710 --> 21:20.098
[door opens]

21:21.010 --> 21:23.183
Deputy Ward.
What are you doing here?

21:23.580 --> 21:25.229
Are the children okay?

21:25.280 --> 21:26.531
Oh, they're fine.

21:26.580 --> 21:28.582
They're better than fine.
That's...

21:28.630 --> 21:30.109
why I came here to talk, Carmen.

21:32.900 --> 21:34.106
I wanna keep my kids.

21:36.160 --> 21:38.936
Well, I'm sure
this can't be easy,

21:38.990 --> 21:40.855
but the children
belong with family.

21:40.900 --> 21:42.811
Exactly.
As far as me and my wife

21:42.860 --> 21:45.294
and the kids are concerned,
we are family.

21:46.210 --> 21:48.166
The law disagrees.

21:48.210 --> 21:50.690
Look, can't we work out
some sort of compromise here?

21:51.310 --> 21:52.914
Where Camilla and Roberto
can keep the stable home

21:52.960 --> 21:54.609
that Teresa and I
created for 'em

21:54.660 --> 21:57.879
and still have you
a big part of their lives?

21:58.490 --> 22:00.742
Look, I was in the system
and bouncing between homes

22:00.790 --> 22:02.746
isn't good
for their development.

22:02.790 --> 22:04.746
This is a stable home.

22:04.800 --> 22:06.188
And with the money
that the state

22:06.230 --> 22:07.663
is going to give me
for keeping the kids--

22:07.710 --> 22:09.143
These kids aren't a paycheck!

22:10.540 --> 22:14.010
Let me remind you, you were MIA
when they needed you most.

22:14.070 --> 22:15.799
Oh, you mean when
you killed their father?

22:16.720 --> 22:18.893
What kind of a grandmother
would I be

22:18.940 --> 22:22.114
if I allowed those kids
to stay with a murderer?

22:23.080 --> 22:25.548
You know how long it took us
to gain their trust...

22:27.730 --> 22:29.379
and make them feel safe again?

22:29.430 --> 22:31.204
I need to protect them.

22:33.090 --> 22:37.345
I get that you're trying to be
a white knight, Mr. Ward.

22:38.700 --> 22:41.749
I just wish people like you
would stop coming around

22:41.790 --> 22:44.441
thinking that brown folks
need you to save them.

22:44.490 --> 22:46.446
CADE: Race has
nothing to do with this!

22:47.100 --> 22:49.489
I love those kids and I'm gonna
keep fighting for 'em.

22:49.540 --> 22:50.700
Can you say the same?

22:52.100 --> 22:54.148
Well, you will lose that fight
when I call DCFS.

22:55.150 --> 22:56.754
Do you raise your voice
to the children

22:56.810 --> 22:58.016
the way you do with me?

22:59.240 --> 23:01.288
Now get the hell out of here

23:01.330 --> 23:02.843
before I call the police, too.

23:10.040 --> 23:11.382
[knocks on door]

23:11.990 --> 23:13.423
I was serious, Riley.

23:14.480 --> 23:16.823
I'll have you escorted back
down to the eighth floor.

23:16.870 --> 23:18.087
Not a good look.

23:18.130 --> 23:19.995
I'm just wrapping up
my investigation.

23:20.050 --> 23:21.392
This is a courtesy call.

23:21.440 --> 23:22.862
Oh, I doubt that.

23:24.400 --> 23:27.130
If I pass the case along
to Justice Integrity Division,

23:27.180 --> 23:28.875
there will be indictments.

23:28.920 --> 23:32.879
Yourself and Deputy Harris
amongst them.

23:32.930 --> 23:35.444
I told you once
about threatening my godson.

23:35.500 --> 23:39.106
Or... you reconsider
your announcement.

23:39.940 --> 23:43.319
I believe your kind
refer to that as extortion.

23:44.550 --> 23:47.018
Ah, semantics.
If you're not sheriff,

23:47.070 --> 23:48.628
then you're not a threat
to the system.

23:48.680 --> 23:51.114
So, really,
I'm saving taxpayer money.

23:51.730 --> 23:53.243
Ithought
you'd appreciate that.

23:53.780 --> 23:55.429
See you on the news, Bill.

23:59.910 --> 24:00.956
Hey, babe.

24:02.040 --> 24:03.689
[sighs]
I think I just blew it.

24:03.740 --> 24:05.082
Big time.

24:05.530 --> 24:06.599
Call me back, would ya?

24:07.700 --> 24:08.917
I need you back home.

24:12.840 --> 24:13.875
Damn it!

24:29.250 --> 24:31.195
Best thing on the menu
is the tongue.

24:32.730 --> 24:34.072
Deputy Minnick.

24:34.120 --> 24:35.508
Levon.

24:35.560 --> 24:37.687
You good?
You look a little jumpy.

24:39.080 --> 24:40.638
I'm actually thinking
about leaving town.

24:42.260 --> 24:43.682
Who are you runnin' from now?

24:45.570 --> 24:46.776
It's not even like that.

24:48.390 --> 24:49.869
It's time to find
a different life.

24:49.920 --> 24:51.080
Where are you headed?

24:51.140 --> 24:52.949
-I--
-Actually, I don't wanna know.

24:55.880 --> 24:56.926
Look”.

24:58.230 --> 25:01.017
thank you for keeping me on
after Luna went.

25:01.890 --> 25:03.107
You didn't have to do that.

25:03.980 --> 25:05.106
Yeah, I did.

25:05.150 --> 25:06.754
You helped me
close his last case.

25:06.800 --> 25:08.279
I know that would have
meant a lot to him.

25:09.980 --> 25:11.026
[cell phone chimes]

25:12.590 --> 25:14.319
Look, I gotta roll, but...

25:14.380 --> 25:15.802
I just wanted to say goodbye.

25:17.380 --> 25:18.415
Take care of yourself.

25:19.380 --> 25:20.426
You, too, Levon.

25:28.650 --> 25:31.346
-Cade. Hey. Can I get your help?
-Yeah, shoot.

25:31.390 --> 25:32.914
BISHOP: All right.
Minnick, Harris, and Carter

25:32.960 --> 25:35.565
are working a case in Malibu,
we got two suspects on.

25:36.230 --> 25:38.221
A daughter who lied about
an altercation with the vic,

25:38.270 --> 25:39.965
and a new wife half his age.

25:40.010 --> 25:42.092
-Rule one...
-Follow the money.

25:42.140 --> 25:44.188
I know, but the wife
signed a prenup

25:44.230 --> 25:46.050
and the kids are already
executors on the estate.

25:46.100 --> 25:47.533
It just doesn't seem
motive enough.

25:47.580 --> 25:49.229
You got paper
to run financials?

25:49.280 --> 25:51.544
-Yeah.
-All right, don't worry
about motive

25:51.590 --> 25:53.546
track what's going where.
There's always a trail.

25:54.330 --> 25:56.195
And filter out the small stuff.

26:00.860 --> 26:01.895
BISHOP: That's interesting.

26:02.820 --> 26:03.855
CADE: What?

26:03.910 --> 26:05.639
The wife has been wiring funds

26:05.690 --> 26:08.033
to a joint account,
but the husband is not

26:08.080 --> 26:09.297
the joint account holder.

26:09.350 --> 26:10.476
Who is?

26:11.960 --> 26:13.439
My guess is the person
who attacked Raymond Corrigan.

26:15.260 --> 26:16.602
-Hey.
-Hey.

26:16.660 --> 26:18.173
-What's going on?
-That was Bishop.

26:18.220 --> 26:19.699
They dug into
Becca's financials.

26:19.750 --> 26:21.832
Let me guess.
She spent it all.

26:21.880 --> 26:24.872
No. Most of it's
being funneled Into
a different account.

26:24.930 --> 26:26.443
Last transfer
was a few hours ago

26:26.490 --> 26:27.536
to some shell company.

26:28.970 --> 26:30.972
That seems a little too
high level for her, right?

26:31.670 --> 26:32.716
JOSEPH: Hmm.

26:34.020 --> 26:36.068
-[beeps]
-She's back at the house.

26:37.590 --> 26:38.841
Just got word
from the hospital.

26:39.680 --> 26:41.022
Raymond passed.

26:41.730 --> 26:43.413
CARTER:
What, so Homicide's
just gonna step in

26:43.470 --> 26:44.949
and snake our arrest now?

26:44.990 --> 26:46.764
JOSEPH:
Not if we can get there first.

26:46.820 --> 26:48.902
I'll change.
We can head back out.

26:49.730 --> 26:51.994
Why? You look nice.

26:53.480 --> 26:55.516
Looking nice
isn't part of the job.

26:56.040 --> 26:58.429
And also... I know.

27:02.220 --> 27:04.745
-Don't say it. Not a word.
-Do I look nice?

27:05.750 --> 27:08.799
["Bring It Back"
by Murf playing]

27:21.720 --> 27:23.506
Mourning period ended quick.

27:23.990 --> 27:25.412
Maybe this is the wake.

27:25.990 --> 27:28.208
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is a private event.

27:28.250 --> 27:29.638
I need to see
a warrant, officer.

27:29.690 --> 27:30.941
Yeah, I got your
warrant right here.

27:30.990 --> 27:32.036
You can't touch me.

27:33.950 --> 27:35.167
[groans]

27:35.210 --> 27:36.609
Put him in the car.

27:36.650 --> 27:38.208

28:03.500 --> 28:05.934
-You seein' her?
-JOSEPH: Nope.

28:08.590 --> 28:09.807
All right, check upstairs.

28:11.820 --> 28:13.151
[music continues]

28:40.370 --> 28:42.713
_ JOSEPH: Wow.
Sleeping With your stepmom?

28:42.760 --> 28:45.581
Pretty sure there's a rule
for this kinda thing, Oliver.

28:47.110 --> 28:48.839
Hey! Hey, stop!

28:50.030 --> 28:51.110
[people scream]

28:54.550 --> 28:55.687
[groans]

28:56.340 --> 28:58.114
I hope she was worth
your father's life.

28:58.170 --> 28:59.728
JOSEPH [on radio]:
Suspect caught, detained.

29:00.730 --> 29:02.129
The other one
is in my custody.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.820
Put your clothes on.
You're coming with me.

29:11.180 --> 29:12.659
LONDON: Is he in?

29:12.700 --> 29:14.258
You can't go in there.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.910
LONDON:
Your posse just can't help
themselves, can they?

29:16.970 --> 29:18.653
Homicide specifically
told Deputy Minnick

29:18.710 --> 29:20.359
they were taking over
the investigation.

29:20.410 --> 29:22.275
And yet she continued
to work on the case.

29:22.320 --> 29:23.799
With assistance
from Major Crimes.

29:23.840 --> 29:27.059
My deputies only worked the case
till Homicide showed up.

29:27.110 --> 29:29.237
They were late,
so we got a jump on things.

29:29.280 --> 29:31.066
Otherwise the case
wouldn't have been solved.

29:31.110 --> 29:32.839
Results don't justify
means, Bill.

29:32.900 --> 29:34.709
Don't they?
You something, Jerry?

29:34.770 --> 29:36.852
I've been doing
a lot of thinking lately.

29:37.420 --> 29:39.376
What it is that I stand for,

29:39.420 --> 29:41.502
what I'm trying to accomplish
in this department,

29:41.560 --> 29:43.425
and the same answer
keeps popping up.

29:43.470 --> 29:44.949
What's that?

29:46.130 --> 29:47.256
I'm here to serve.

29:48.870 --> 29:51.600
170 years of
experience and tradition

29:51.650 --> 29:53.208
led to the policies
and procedures

29:53.260 --> 29:55.262
that you undermine
on a daily whim.

29:55.830 --> 29:58.788
Why is your judgment so superior
to those who came before you?

29:58.840 --> 30:00.876
Why can't you
stay in your lane?

30:00.920 --> 30:02.478
For the sake
of the department?

30:02.530 --> 30:04.350
For those that'll sit in
your chair after you're gone?

30:05.710 --> 30:07.496
Guys like you, you mean.

30:07.540 --> 30:09.758
You know, believe it or not,
Bill, no, not guys like me.

30:10.370 --> 30:12.531
While you were content to work
the streets your whole career

30:12.590 --> 30:14.103
with no ambition
of higher office,

30:14.160 --> 30:15.764
I was doing my homework,

30:15.810 --> 30:18.119
learning on the tenth floor,
studying for the job.

30:19.030 --> 30:21.419
Protocol is the backbone
of this department, Bill.

30:21.470 --> 30:22.767
Deep down, you know that.

30:25.600 --> 30:26.726
I'm announcing today.

30:26.780 --> 30:28.338
I'd like you to be there.

30:29.170 --> 30:30.558
Why would I do that?

30:32.960 --> 30:34.029
Because I asked.

30:39.440 --> 30:40.486
So?

30:40.920 --> 30:42.478
Just got off with Homicide.

30:42.530 --> 30:44.009
Oliver confessed.

30:44.050 --> 30:45.654
What, to everything?

30:46.270 --> 30:48.318
He and Becca had been
sleeping together for months.

30:49.020 --> 30:51.750
Once he found out that he got
cut out of his dad's will,

30:51.800 --> 30:53.848
he convinced her
to marry the old man.

30:53.890 --> 30:56.279
Share the money.
They did it together.

30:56.330 --> 30:59.197
Well, it's time for me
to celebrate with the boys.

30:59.940 --> 31:01.157
It's 11:00 am.

31:01.200 --> 31:03.327
Yeah. I've been up
for 36 hours.

31:03.380 --> 31:05.678
So it's midnight
as far as I'm concerned.

31:05.730 --> 31:07.027
You wanna come?

31:07.080 --> 31:08.980
MINNICK:
After he finishes his paperwork.

31:09.040 --> 31:10.598
And don't think
I don't know it was you

31:10.650 --> 31:12.379
who convinced him
to pass off hIS reports

31:12.430 --> 31:14.250
to Deputy Adams, Carter.

31:14.820 --> 31:17.516
He needs to learn the right way
before he learns the shortcuts.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.479
-Understood.
-MINNICK: Hmm.

31:19.520 --> 31:20.566
I will see you soon.

31:24.620 --> 31:27.009
I get it.
You don't like Carter.

31:27.050 --> 31:28.927
I don't give a damn
about Carter.

31:34.710 --> 31:36.052
Don't take this the wrong way,

31:37.670 --> 31:39.149
but you have an opportunity

31:39.200 --> 31:41.543
to be one of the best
this department has to offer.

31:43.160 --> 31:44.673
I'm rooting for you,

31:44.720 --> 31:47.336
but if you get wrapped up
with the wrong crowd,

31:47.380 --> 31:49.245
you're gonna forget
how special you really are.

31:52.430 --> 31:53.943
I'm hearing a couple
of things from that.

31:53.990 --> 31:56.072
One, you think I'm very special,
which I appreciate.

31:56.130 --> 31:58.951
[sighs] Okay, here you go
running your mouth again.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.558
Two, there's no wrong way
to take it

32:00.610 --> 32:03.170
because the fact that you are
thinking about me so much

32:03.220 --> 32:04.346
is all that really matters.

32:04.400 --> 32:05.651
Okay, I'm done.

32:07.090 --> 32:08.352
Wait, am I close?

32:10.530 --> 32:11.963
I'm in the ballpark, right?

32:16.760 --> 32:18.887
Carol.
Close the door, please.

32:19.580 --> 32:21.229
A woman always
loves to hear that.

32:26.030 --> 32:27.679
I have information
that can hurt Bill.

32:34.690 --> 32:37.079
-What are you waiting for?
-What are you offering?

32:37.120 --> 32:39.429
Oh, so this is a trade?

32:39.910 --> 32:40.945
No.

32:41.430 --> 32:42.954
I want you to concede the race.

32:43.910 --> 32:45.309
Serve in my administration.

32:45.350 --> 32:46.658
What do you have on him?

32:47.260 --> 32:49.399
-Do we have_ a deal?
-Let me get this straight.

32:49.440 --> 32:50.953
You have information

32:51.010 --> 32:53.001
_that'l| sink _
Hollister's campaign,

32:53.050 --> 32:55.052
clearing the path
for my election.

32:55.100 --> 32:56.874
And you want me to concede?

32:56.930 --> 32:59.535
Then, and only then
will I release it.

33:00.190 --> 33:01.578
Wow.

33:03.060 --> 33:04.402
Too bad, Jerry.

33:06.070 --> 33:07.674
I am so curious now.

33:12.030 --> 33:14.191
BISHOP:
Really? I like the one
with the pool view.

33:14.250 --> 33:15.638
Might make me forget
I'm in the valley.

33:15.680 --> 33:17.159
OFFICER:
Deputy Bishop?

33:17.210 --> 33:18.689
Here are those files from
the coroner you requested.

33:18.730 --> 33:20.948
Thank you. Great.
Hey, I gotta go.

33:20.990 --> 33:22.252
Yep.

33:33.700 --> 33:35.179
Hi, is this Deputy Friedman?

33:35.230 --> 33:36.788
This is Bishop
from Major Crimes.

33:36.840 --> 33:38.319
Wondering if you can
help me out.

33:38.360 --> 33:40.180
Nicholas Phillips,
did you know him?

33:40.230 --> 33:42.278
Had Phoenix tags on his arms?

33:43.190 --> 33:44.964
Yeah, I'm looking at
the coroner report right now.

33:45.450 --> 33:47.975
I was wondering if you
could tell me whether
he was one of ours.

33:48.590 --> 33:49.750
An informant, yeah.

33:51.680 --> 33:52.715
That's what I thought.

33:53.110 --> 33:54.634
No, I know.

33:54.680 --> 33:56.409
It looks like they did it
to make an example of him.

33:57.120 --> 33:58.280
I will, thank you.

34:03.990 --> 34:05.423
[gate buzzes]

34:09.520 --> 34:11.431
I have some things
I need to say.

34:12.570 --> 34:15.391
-And you're going to listen.
-ROSE: Is that right?

34:16.180 --> 34:17.215
I'm all ears.

34:18.880 --> 34:21.041
You're never gonna
see David again.

34:22.230 --> 34:23.663
Was it worth that?

34:23.710 --> 34:25.189
ROSE:
I didn't have a choice.

34:25.840 --> 34:27.398
Sure you did.

34:27.450 --> 34:28.667
No one else _
was gonna save him.

34:30.060 --> 34:31.277
I would have found a way.

34:31.330 --> 34:33.104
But you took that
power away from me

34:33.150 --> 34:34.845
when you broke into the prison.

34:36.330 --> 34:37.888
And since then, I just...

34:39.330 --> 34:40.592
[sighs]

34:43.640 --> 34:46.814
I've been letting you
hold onto some of my power.

34:48.600 --> 34:50.033
Is that right?

34:51.130 --> 34:52.165
Yeah, that's right.

34:53.520 --> 34:54.646
But not anymore.

34:56.130 --> 34:57.609
'Cause I know what I'm made of

34:57.660 --> 35:01.915
and I am not gonna let
you affect my life anymore.

35:06.230 --> 35:08.744
This all started
because you lost faith.

35:10.670 --> 35:12.752
Here comes the God speech.

35:12.800 --> 35:14.495
That's not the kind of faith
I'm talking about.

35:14.540 --> 35:16.098
I'm talking about
faith in people.

35:16.760 --> 35:18.978
If I can save someone,
I'm gonna do it.

35:19.020 --> 35:21.762
I don't care who they are
or what they've done.

35:21.810 --> 35:24.119
And my husband
lives by the same code.

35:25.210 --> 35:27.462
Until you crossed the line.

35:28.820 --> 35:31.425
And that's the choice
that you made.

35:33.170 --> 35:34.512
Are you finished?

35:35.480 --> 35:38.950
I am not afraid anymore.

35:48.400 --> 35:49.708
Now I'm finished.

36:08.640 --> 36:11.029
CARTER: I gotta say, at least
Corrigan went out with a bang.

36:11.080 --> 36:13.776
I'm inspired.
That could be me one day.

36:14.520 --> 36:16.988
Malibu mansion.
Instagram Wife.

36:17.390 --> 36:19.608
Weird guy out back,
creeping on you at night.

36:20.130 --> 36:22.212
Who can blame him for
wantin' to see the show?

36:25.310 --> 36:26.390
Shot for the road?

36:26.880 --> 36:29.303
No. Man, how do you
function tomorrow?

36:29.880 --> 36:31.745
Practice and consistency.

36:33.100 --> 36:34.135
Let's go.

36:44.980 --> 36:46.231
CARTER:
Whoa. Watch yourself.

36:46.760 --> 36:49.285
Hey. What'd you say to me?

36:51.510 --> 36:53.239
I said why don't you
watch yourself?

36:53.290 --> 36:55.019
Hey, hey, hey. Chill out.

36:55.080 --> 36:56.422
Control your boy, man.

36:56.910 --> 36:59.162
-What?
-JOSEPH: Hey, hey!

37:00.650 --> 37:02.072
[groans]

37:02.780 --> 37:03.951
Hey, get off of him, man.

37:04.650 --> 37:06.436
Carter, Carter,
come on, bro.

37:06.480 --> 37:07.560
Carter!

37:16.660 --> 37:18.400
Carter, Carter,
Carter, Carter, stop.

37:18.450 --> 37:20.884
Hey!Enough!
Carter, let's go.

37:23.060 --> 37:24.448
What the hell, man?

37:27.110 --> 37:29.886
What the hell is Joseph
doing here anyway at this time?

37:33.030 --> 37:34.372
Someone start talkin'.

37:35.070 --> 37:36.799
This is on me, Sheriff.

37:36.860 --> 37:39.249
This guy,
he bumped into me...

37:39.770 --> 37:41.112
BILL: The guy they just
took to the hospital?

37:41.170 --> 37:43.684
Yeah.
And we had words,

37:43.730 --> 37:46.426
Harris stepped in,
he-he deescalated by the book.

37:47.910 --> 37:50.435
And then this guy just
started yelling at my boy.

37:50.480 --> 37:51.788
Yelling what?

37:51.830 --> 37:52.865
Just...

37:53.440 --> 37:54.520
Racial stuff.

37:54.570 --> 37:56.390
Slurs, sir.

37:56.920 --> 37:59.263
And, uh, I just lost it.

38:00.010 --> 38:01.921
I'm sure he's gonna
claim assault.

38:01.970 --> 38:03.483
And-and I'm sorry,

38:03.540 --> 38:05.496
but I'm always gonna
have my boy's back.

38:07.240 --> 38:08.662
That how you recall things?

38:10.980 --> 38:12.060
Yeah.

38:12.550 --> 38:14.108
Yeah, that's pretty much
how it went down.

38:19.600 --> 38:20.942
Put 'em in the tank

38:20.990 --> 38:22.685
till they come up with
a better explanation.

38:22.730 --> 38:24.209
When you wear the badge,

38:24.250 --> 38:26.206
you have to represent
a higher standard.

38:27.260 --> 38:28.329
This isn't it.

38:50.630 --> 38:52.052
you'll have two black eyes.

38:53.890 --> 38:55.141
I'm sorry.

38:58.590 --> 39:00.672
-We good?
-No, we are not good.

39:15.570 --> 39:16.639
You made it, Dad.

39:16.700 --> 39:17.997
Hey.

39:18.050 --> 39:19.995
I figured you needed
another Hollister man

39:20.050 --> 39:21.699
here to witness this circus.

39:22.570 --> 39:24.128
Don't get too sentimental.

39:24.180 --> 39:25.784
Remember something for me.

39:26.490 --> 39:29.095
This moment,
all these cameras,

39:29.840 --> 39:31.091
doesn't mean anything.

39:32.280 --> 39:34.840
What you do with it,
that's what matters.

39:36.410 --> 39:38.844
-I'm proud of you, son.
-Thanks, Dad.

39:40.900 --> 39:43.323
-You good?
-I got closure.

39:44.160 --> 39:46.720
-And now it's up to me.
-I know you can handle it.

39:48.470 --> 39:50.688
-Thanks for coming.
-Of course.

39:50.730 --> 39:52.334
-Jorge.
-You got this.

39:54.080 --> 39:55.126
Go get 'em, Dad.

39:56.870 --> 39:58.952
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.080
Here we go.

40:07.310 --> 40:08.789
I shouldn't be standing here.

40:11.840 --> 40:13.398
Came down to some bad luck,

40:15.230 --> 40:18.666
and a single line
on a 170-year-old document.

40:19.630 --> 40:21.939
We're all expected
to have faith in the system.

40:22.810 --> 40:25.802
Well, nothing I've witnessed
over the past 108 days

40:25.850 --> 40:27.499
has made me a believer.

40:28.640 --> 40:31.689
Hypocrisy, corruption, fear.

40:31.730 --> 40:33.425
That's the system.

40:33.470 --> 40:34.687
That's not who we are.

40:36.250 --> 40:39.253
That's _not what it means
to pm this star to your chest.

40:41.130 --> 40:42.256
What it means...

40:43.520 --> 40:45.693
is that against all odds
I have the power

40:45.740 --> 40:47.526
to change this world
for the better.

40:48.140 --> 40:51.655
And with that power
comes grave responsibility.

40:52.270 --> 40:53.874
The Hall of Justice,

40:54.450 --> 40:56.668
it belongs to the people
of Los Angeles.

40:57.540 --> 41:00.759
And the brave men
and women who put on
this uniform every day,

41:01.720 --> 41:05.588
prepared to make
the ultimate sacrifice.

41:09.240 --> 41:10.457
That's who I serve.

41:11.680 --> 41:13.853
And that's who I want
standing beside me.

41:15.210 --> 41:16.984
The ones who hold the line.

41:18.690 --> 41:20.646
And the ones we've lost
along the way.

41:25.570 --> 41:27.083
My name is Bill Hollister.

41:28.390 --> 41:30.472
I'm the sheriff
of Los Angeles County.

41:32.350 --> 41:34.136
And I aim to keep this job.

41:34.620 --> 41:35.746
But that...

41:37.750 --> 41:38.921
that'll be up to you.

41:38.970 --> 41:40.403
[cameras clicking]

41:41.580 --> 41:43.753
-Thank you.
-[applause]

41:53.420 --> 41:55.729
Hey, you headed down
to, uh, Bill's thing?

41:55.770 --> 41:57.852
Wanted to,
but take a look at this.

41:58.290 --> 41:59.769
I just ID'd
another informant.

41:59.820 --> 42:01.902
This one was found hanging
from a flagpole.

42:03.300 --> 42:05.905
Are you telling me this is
connected to Williams' death?

42:05.950 --> 42:07.679
It's hell of a coincidence
if it isn't.

42:26.190 --> 42:27.976
BILL:
Explain it to me again.

42:28.020 --> 42:29.669
Two dead in two days.

42:29.720 --> 42:30.880
Signatures are different

42:30.930 --> 42:32.488
but they have
something in common.

42:36.160 --> 42:37.980
They're all informants
for the department.

42:38.030 --> 42:39.850
