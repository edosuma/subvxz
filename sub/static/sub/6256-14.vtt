00:13.839 --> 00:15.739
Figured you wouldn't pick up.

00:16.071 --> 00:18.038
Who would take a call
from Hollis Pepall,

00:18.073 --> 00:20.140
the least important man
in the world?

00:20.175 --> 00:22.842
Certainly not my wife.

00:22.878 --> 00:24.844
But you know what?

00:24.880 --> 00:27.514
I don't care anymore.

00:27.549 --> 00:29.516
It's over.

00:29.551 --> 00:33.353
This is on your head, bitch.

00:55.143 --> 00:56.409
Help!

00:59.347 --> 01:00.280
Help!

01:00.315 --> 01:01.915
Help!

01:01.950 --> 01:03.416
Help!

01:06.080 --> 01:08.180
<i>Dad, you made plans</i>
<i>with Christine.</i>

01:08.215 --> 01:09.314
<i>You can't just</i>

01:09.349 --> 01:10.649
break them at the last minute.

01:10.684 --> 01:12.651
I'm sorry, Tempe,
this just came up.

01:12.686 --> 01:13.885
I-I have to go
out of town.

01:13.921 --> 01:15.687
What came up, exactly?

01:15.722 --> 01:17.155
It doesn't matter.

01:17.191 --> 01:18.723
I'll be back
in a couple of days.

01:18.759 --> 01:20.692
That's not an
answer, Dad.

01:20.727 --> 01:22.761
It's the only answer
I can give you right now.

01:22.796 --> 01:24.229
You're doing it again.

01:24.264 --> 01:25.597
What? What am I doing?

01:25.632 --> 01:26.832
Keeping secrets from me, lying.

01:26.867 --> 01:29.935
Are... are you
in trouble again?

01:29.970 --> 01:31.303
No.

01:31.338 --> 01:32.637
And when I do
come back,

01:32.673 --> 01:34.706
I'll spend the whole weekend
with Christine.

01:34.741 --> 01:36.174
Just go, Dad.

01:36.210 --> 01:37.542
I-I don't want
you to be late

01:37.578 --> 01:39.411
for whatever it is
you're hiding from me.

01:39.446 --> 01:40.679
Tempe.

01:41.949 --> 01:42.949
Brennan.

01:42.983 --> 01:44.382
Oh.

01:44.418 --> 01:46.384
Oh, okay.
Right away.

01:46.420 --> 01:47.853
I have to get Christine
ready for day care

01:47.888 --> 01:48.820
and get to work.

01:48.856 --> 01:49.988
No, I'll drive her.

01:50.023 --> 01:52.491
No, don't bother.

01:52.526 --> 01:54.860
Christine, you ready?

01:54.895 --> 01:56.495
Christine?

01:57.998 --> 01:59.698
Ugh, I'm late.

01:59.733 --> 02:01.399
We'd be on time if we didn't
like each other so much.

02:01.435 --> 02:02.435
Oh, I know.

02:02.469 --> 02:03.835
Being in love is such a drag.

02:04.905 --> 02:06.338
Hey, wait a minute.

02:06.373 --> 02:07.305
We've got plenty of time.

02:07.341 --> 02:09.140
Maybe we could...

02:09.175 --> 02:10.616
Sorry, but that's
not the right time.

02:10.644 --> 02:11.810
That clock was my grandmother's.

02:11.845 --> 02:13.512
I think that's why
she was always late.

02:13.547 --> 02:14.946
Oh, nice clock.

02:14.982 --> 02:16.448
I know.

02:16.483 --> 02:18.216
I was gonna take it in
to get it cleaned.

02:18.252 --> 02:19.451
I thought
that might help.

02:19.486 --> 02:21.520
But I love that thing.

02:36.503 --> 02:37.836
Everything all right?

02:37.871 --> 02:39.638
Yeah, uh, sure... you know,
I'll tell you what--

02:39.673 --> 02:41.606
I know a great clock... maker.

02:41.642 --> 02:43.742
I can bring it in,
get it cleaned for you.

02:43.777 --> 02:44.777
You don't have to.

02:44.811 --> 02:45.811
Oh, n-n-no,
it-it's fine.

02:45.812 --> 02:46.912
Uh, it was your
grandmother's.

02:46.947 --> 02:48.313
I know how much
she meant to you.

02:48.348 --> 02:49.348
I'm happy to do it.

02:49.383 --> 02:51.316
You're the best.

02:52.786 --> 02:55.554
Have a good day.

03:08.535 --> 03:10.635
You're pretty quiet,
what's going on?

03:10.671 --> 03:12.537
It's Max.

03:12.573 --> 03:13.738
What's wrong with Max?

03:13.774 --> 03:15.574
Is he sick or something?
No.

03:15.609 --> 03:16.708
Nothing like that.

03:16.743 --> 03:18.443
He just... he made plans
with Christine,

03:18.478 --> 03:19.911
and now he's
abandoning her.

03:19.947 --> 03:21.079
Abandoning her?

03:22.416 --> 03:24.349
Well, he's going
out of town.

03:24.384 --> 03:25.951
I'm sorry, am I missing
something here?

03:25.986 --> 03:27.819
Are you...
you're mad at Max

03:27.854 --> 03:29.354
because he's going
out of town?

03:29.389 --> 03:30.755
Wait, so where's
he going?

03:30.791 --> 03:31.823
That's the thing.

03:31.858 --> 03:34.226
When I asked,
he refused to tell me.

03:34.261 --> 03:36.428
Well, I guess that's
a little unusual.

03:36.463 --> 03:37.963
He's hiding
something, Booth.

03:37.998 --> 03:39.598
With Max,
that's never good.

03:39.633 --> 03:41.666
Okay, look, let's not
jump to conclusions here.

03:41.702 --> 03:43.101
I mean, Max has been on
the straight and narrow

03:43.136 --> 03:44.536
for some time.

03:44.571 --> 03:46.738
Then why won't he answer
a simple question?

03:46.773 --> 03:48.306
Look, you know what,
it might not be

03:48.342 --> 03:49.641
as bad as you
think, all right?

03:49.676 --> 03:50.976
There could be a very
innocent explanation

03:51.011 --> 03:52.011
for him taking off.

03:52.012 --> 03:54.679
Really?

03:54.715 --> 03:55.814
No.

03:55.849 --> 03:57.315
No. No, he's up
to something.

03:57.351 --> 03:58.950
I knew it, he's...
it's no good.

04:03.090 --> 04:04.856
Okay, look.

04:04.891 --> 04:06.858
I can put a tracker on him,
if that makes you feel better.

04:06.893 --> 04:08.260
I-I'd like that.
Okay, fine.

04:08.295 --> 04:09.728
You sure you want
me to spy on him?

04:09.763 --> 04:11.396
Absolutely, wasn't
your offer sincere?

04:11.431 --> 04:13.031
It was very sincere, I'm
just asking, you know...

04:13.066 --> 04:15.426
Hey, so we couldn't get to the
remains from the lower floor,

04:15.435 --> 04:16.767
so I finally get to
use my Superwinch.

04:16.803 --> 04:18.837
Call the media--
bug boy uses a new toy.

04:18.872 --> 04:20.404
Hey, I'm not gonna let
your cold dark heart

04:20.440 --> 04:21.773
ruin my lucky
day, all right?

04:21.808 --> 04:23.768
Well, luck has nothing
to do with it, Dr. Hodgins.

04:23.777 --> 04:26.011
But I imagine there's an easier
way to access the remains.

04:26.046 --> 04:27.846
Wow, you guys are a couple
of real downers.

04:27.881 --> 04:29.314
But you're too late.

04:30.884 --> 04:32.717
Ooh.

04:32.753 --> 04:34.719
Watch out,
he's dripping.

04:34.755 --> 04:36.621
Oh, God,
that really stinks.

04:36.657 --> 04:39.924
Big part of the frontal
bone of the skull is missing.

04:39.960 --> 04:41.526
Well, maybe it
was done deliberately

04:41.561 --> 04:43.461
to obscure the
victim's identity.

04:43.497 --> 04:46.531
All idle speculation until we
get the remains back to the lab.

04:46.566 --> 04:48.667
Well, the birds definitely
did their job on this guy.

04:48.702 --> 04:49.734
Yeah, here.

04:49.770 --> 04:50.802
Masks, everybody.

04:50.837 --> 04:52.504
Bird droppings are
extremely toxic.

04:52.539 --> 04:53.672
What are you
talking about?

04:53.707 --> 04:54.806
You got to wear masks

04:54.841 --> 04:56.641
in order to look
at bird poop?

04:56.677 --> 04:58.043
Yeah, bird guano's
been known to carry

04:58.078 --> 04:59.744
more than 60
transmittable diseases.

04:59.780 --> 05:01.980
That's okay-- you can wear
that little bird guano mask,

05:02.015 --> 05:04.516
I'll be over there in the
poop-free zone, doing my thing.

05:04.551 --> 05:07.519
The remains are
in an active stage of decay.

05:07.554 --> 05:09.554
Which means they've
been here a while.

05:09.589 --> 05:10.989
The slanted squamosal
of the remaining

05:11.024 --> 05:14.192
frontal bones of the skull
suggests male.

05:14.227 --> 05:17.896
Mid-30s, according to the shape
of the sternal rib ends.

05:17.931 --> 05:20.999
Carcass has been deflated
due to the feeding

05:21.034 --> 05:22.634
of dipteran larvae,

05:22.669 --> 05:24.469
and the <i> Calliphoridae</i> flies
indicate

05:24.504 --> 05:26.571
the body's been here
about seven or eight days.

05:28.942 --> 05:30.442
Okay, everybody in a mask.

05:30.477 --> 05:31.910
Put him down--
we got some blood

05:31.945 --> 05:34.012
over on the railing,
and it's smeared.

05:34.047 --> 05:35.714
Look at that.

05:35.749 --> 05:37.048
Huh?

05:37.084 --> 05:39.050
There's also
some passive spatter

05:39.086 --> 05:40.719
and some overlap
on the smear.

05:40.754 --> 05:41.954
Yeah, somebody
had some trouble

05:41.955 --> 05:43.421
throwing this body
over the rail.

05:43.457 --> 05:45.390
Indicating it probably
wasn't a suicide.

05:45.425 --> 05:47.025
Oh, Dr. Hodgins,
what are you doing?

05:47.060 --> 05:48.226
Yeah, oh, just checking
to make sure

05:48.261 --> 05:49.194
there are no more remains below.

05:49.229 --> 05:51.029
Wh... That's not necessary.

05:51.064 --> 05:53.031
Yeah, it's okay, I'm just
gonna take a quick peek.

05:53.066 --> 05:55.100
All right,
take me back.

05:55.135 --> 05:56.501
Be right back.

06:01.641 --> 06:03.641
Oh, this is not fun.

06:04.978 --> 06:06.945
Uh, okay,
what's going on here?

06:06.980 --> 06:08.513
Got a little problem here.

06:08.548 --> 06:09.981
It's jammed.

06:10.016 --> 06:12.584
Yeah, okay, well,
I'm halfway down and dangling.

06:12.619 --> 06:14.386
Yeah, we're working on it.

06:14.421 --> 06:16.654
Did you hit the red button
and flip the yellow switch?

06:16.690 --> 06:18.156
Yes, I-I hit the red button

06:18.191 --> 06:20.158
and I-I flicked the switch.

06:20.193 --> 06:21.526
Not so super now,
huh, bug boy?

06:21.561 --> 06:22.561
I'll tell you what.

06:22.562 --> 06:23.562
Have a nice hang.

06:23.597 --> 06:25.063
I got to go back
to the lab.

06:25.098 --> 06:26.931
Uh, he-he's my ride.

06:26.967 --> 06:28.266
See ya.
No.

06:28.301 --> 06:29.834
Well, don't go.

06:29.870 --> 06:31.870
Are you sure you're looking
at the red button

06:31.905 --> 06:33.138
and not the blue one?

06:33.173 --> 06:34.839
What was it again?

06:34.875 --> 06:36.174
I thought you
said blue.

06:36.209 --> 06:37.675
Really?
I'll try it again.

06:37.711 --> 06:39.239
Great.

07:10.601 --> 07:12.701
All right, I have neutralized
the bird guano

07:13.584 --> 07:15.517
with a glycol
disinfectant concentrate,

07:15.553 --> 07:18.220
so we should
be good now.

07:18.255 --> 07:22.624
It appears the bird guano has
actually eaten away the bones.

07:22.660 --> 07:24.593
You're right-- there's some
serious osteo-compromise

07:24.628 --> 07:25.761
going on here.

07:25.796 --> 07:27.463
Well, bird droppings
are very corrosive

07:27.498 --> 07:29.431
because birds excrete
both solid and liquid waste

07:29.467 --> 07:30.699
from the same
orifice.

07:30.735 --> 07:32.334
Ew, not another one

07:32.369 --> 07:34.837
of your disgusting
creature lessons.

07:34.872 --> 07:36.505
More importantly, if true,

07:36.540 --> 07:38.640
the bird guano needs
to be removed immediately,

07:38.676 --> 07:40.042
or my bones will
be destroyed.

07:40.077 --> 07:42.077
Unfortunately,
that can't happen

07:42.113 --> 07:43.846
until I finish
my particulates sweep.

07:43.881 --> 07:45.981
I've got some interesting
exposed ligaments here.

07:48.619 --> 07:50.586
There's a thickening
of the ligaments

07:50.621 --> 07:52.501
surrounding the median nerve
at the right wrist.

07:52.523 --> 07:53.555
Carpal tunnel?

07:53.591 --> 07:54.923
That would be
my assumption.

07:54.959 --> 07:56.859
I've got a nice sized
piece of liver here

07:56.894 --> 07:58.627
that the predators
overlooked.

07:58.662 --> 08:00.562
I'll run a tox screen and
see if I can find anything.

08:00.598 --> 08:02.498
Take a look at this,
Dr. Saroyan.

08:04.001 --> 08:05.834
That looks like an entry wound.

08:05.870 --> 08:07.035
A bullet?

08:07.071 --> 08:08.537
Probably from a rifle.

08:08.572 --> 08:10.506
It went in small
through the back of the head.

08:10.541 --> 08:11.907
And the exit wound
split the skull,

08:11.942 --> 08:13.575
explaining the missing parts

08:13.611 --> 08:16.712
of the frontal bones,
zygomatic and nasal bones.

08:16.747 --> 08:18.046
I'm going out on a limb here

08:18.082 --> 08:19.915
and saying we just found
cause of death.

08:28.058 --> 08:30.726
Dr. Saroyan found
evidence

08:30.761 --> 08:32.727
of beta blockers
in the victim's liver.

08:32.763 --> 08:34.897
He'd be kind of young
to suffer from heart issues.

08:34.932 --> 08:37.065
And he had carpal tunnel
syndrome in his right hand.

08:37.101 --> 08:40.068
Beta blockers,
carpal tunnel.

08:40.104 --> 08:41.503
Could be
a contract killer.

08:41.539 --> 08:43.739
Really? How do
you jump to that?

08:43.774 --> 08:45.741
Contract killers, you know,
they often take beta blockers.

08:45.776 --> 08:47.776
And the army snipers
that I used to train with,

08:47.812 --> 08:49.578
you know, they used to take them
to steady their hands.

08:49.613 --> 08:51.046
And the carpal tunnel's
from the repeated pressure

08:51.081 --> 08:52.648
on his thumb and
trigger finger.

08:52.683 --> 08:54.583
There, it wasn't so hard,
now, was it?

08:54.618 --> 08:55.818
What do you got there?

08:55.853 --> 08:59.354
The, uh, contents of
the victim's pockets.

08:59.390 --> 09:01.623
Uh, got your cigarettes,
condoms, a pencil.

09:01.659 --> 09:03.959
And that looks like some
kind of secret code.

09:03.994 --> 09:05.394
Maybe the killer
was after it?

09:05.429 --> 09:06.428
Then why didn't
he take it?

09:06.463 --> 09:07.396
No cell phone?

09:07.431 --> 09:08.730
Didn't find one on the body.

09:08.766 --> 09:09.998
Searched the area, nothing.

09:10.034 --> 09:12.201
So he didn't have one,
or the killer took it.

09:15.039 --> 09:18.006
You put a tracking device
on Dr. Brennan's dad?

09:19.476 --> 09:20.976
Just stay in your own lane.

09:21.879 --> 09:24.012
Okay?

09:24.048 --> 09:25.547
Don't you think that it's odd
that the victim

09:25.583 --> 09:26.748
didn't have
a cell phone?

09:26.784 --> 09:28.483
Why don't you call
the service carriers

09:28.519 --> 09:31.420
and see if you get a phone number.
Okay.

09:31.455 --> 09:34.590
Take the condoms off my desk,
please, too.

09:37.795 --> 09:39.161
Hey, you almost
finished?

09:39.196 --> 09:41.930
Don't rush the chef
when he's making a stew.

09:41.966 --> 09:43.498
Hey, I found
cannulated screws

09:43.534 --> 09:45.434
in the greater tuberosity
of the left humerus.

09:45.469 --> 09:47.102
Oh, I know,
I saw those-- right here.

09:47.137 --> 09:49.771
Yeah, it's a shame that screws
don't have serial numbers.

09:49.807 --> 09:51.440
We could have
gotten an I.D.

09:51.475 --> 09:53.775
Right, but tuberosity
fractures are extremely rare.

09:53.811 --> 09:56.178
I asked Angela to run
through surgery logs

09:56.213 --> 09:58.480
at the local hospital,
maybe get an I.D. that way.

09:58.515 --> 10:00.816
You think that's enough
for her to run anything?

10:00.851 --> 10:02.551
Sure, I mean, she has sex
and age from Dr. Brennan,

10:02.586 --> 10:04.553
and the remodeling shows
that the fractures happened

10:04.588 --> 10:06.388
about ten years ago,
which should be enough

10:06.423 --> 10:08.156
to narrow it down even more.
Yeah, that's true.

10:08.192 --> 10:09.625
All right, here we go.

10:09.660 --> 10:10.660
Last of the bones.

10:10.661 --> 10:12.461
Can you grab that?

10:12.496 --> 10:13.962
Awesome.

10:15.432 --> 10:18.967
Hey, do you know
anything about clocks?

10:19.003 --> 10:20.502
Yeah, actually--
I took apart every clock

10:20.537 --> 10:22.504
in my parents' house
when I was a kid.

10:22.539 --> 10:24.072
Of course you did.

10:24.108 --> 10:25.641
I got in big trouble
for that, too.

10:25.676 --> 10:27.356
Until I moved on to the furnace.

10:28.746 --> 10:31.013
Uh, Andie's grandmother
left her a clock,

10:31.048 --> 10:32.614
and I, uh...

10:32.650 --> 10:34.216
I want to get it
fixed for her.

10:34.251 --> 10:37.886
Aw, so she can see
how wonderful you are.

10:37.922 --> 10:39.721
That's sweet.
Yeah.

10:39.757 --> 10:41.590
The jewelers,
they won't even open it

10:41.625 --> 10:43.492
for less than 500 bucks.

10:43.527 --> 10:44.726
You know I can't afford that.

10:44.762 --> 10:46.128
Yeah, no problem, brother.
Bring it in.

10:46.163 --> 10:47.729
Let's see what Father Time
can do with it.

10:47.765 --> 10:49.831
Hey.

10:49.867 --> 10:51.266
I found the surgery.

10:51.302 --> 10:52.834
It was done at St. Joe's

10:52.870 --> 10:54.836
ten years ago,

10:54.872 --> 10:57.105
and the victim is Troy Carter.

10:57.141 --> 11:01.076
His brother Jake
reported him missing last week.

11:03.080 --> 11:04.746
Oh, God.

11:04.782 --> 11:05.948
I don't believe this.

11:05.983 --> 11:07.049
What happened?

11:07.084 --> 11:08.817
He was shot, Jake.

11:08.852 --> 11:10.052
Shot?

11:10.087 --> 11:11.520
No, Th...

11:11.555 --> 11:12.654
that crazy bastard.

11:12.690 --> 11:13.922
I warned him.

11:13.958 --> 11:16.124
Yeah, well,
we know that your brother

11:16.160 --> 11:17.225
was a marksman.

11:17.261 --> 11:19.695
What? Troy? No, no.

11:19.730 --> 11:23.699
He used beta blockers
and had carpal tunnel syndrome,

11:23.734 --> 11:25.033
which usually means...
No.

11:25.069 --> 11:26.535
That-that wasn't for shooting.

11:26.570 --> 11:27.703
That was for golf.

11:27.738 --> 11:29.504
Troy was a golfer.

11:29.540 --> 11:31.206
Golf?

11:31.241 --> 11:32.641
Yeah, he-he took
the beta blockers

11:32.676 --> 11:33.842
to improve his game.

11:33.877 --> 11:35.043
It steadied his hand.

11:35.079 --> 11:36.678
He was a pro.

11:36.714 --> 11:38.313
I-I don't know
if it was all legal.

11:38.349 --> 11:40.649
Can't imagine the PGA would
allow their players...

11:40.684 --> 11:41.917
No, no, not the PGA.

11:41.952 --> 11:43.452
Troy played mini golf.

11:44.621 --> 11:46.088
Mini golf?

11:46.123 --> 11:49.691
Like, get the ball
in the clown's mouth golf?

11:49.727 --> 11:50.826
Yeah.

11:50.861 --> 11:52.260
He was obsessed with it.

11:52.296 --> 11:54.062
He was starting to make
a little money at it, too.

11:54.098 --> 11:55.964
That's why he was thinking
about quitting the business.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.566
What business was that?

11:57.601 --> 11:59.634
We have
a landscaping business together.

11:59.670 --> 12:01.970
It's A Green Green
World Landscaping.

12:02.006 --> 12:04.206
Just got a big contract, too,
not that he cared.

12:04.241 --> 12:06.141
There's money in mini golf?

12:06.176 --> 12:07.876
Not as much as there is
in landscaping.

12:07.911 --> 12:09.311
You wouldn't believe
how many times I told him that,

12:09.346 --> 12:10.979
but it was all
about the glamour for him.

12:11.015 --> 12:12.881
Glamour in mini golf.

12:12.916 --> 12:14.549
Okay.

12:14.585 --> 12:17.953
Uh, any idea who might want
to kill your brother?

12:17.988 --> 12:19.121
Those mini golfers.

12:19.156 --> 12:20.989
Troy was kicking their asses.

12:21.025 --> 12:23.058
And-and they're all
getting ready for the masters.

12:23.093 --> 12:25.127
Mini golf has a masters?

12:25.162 --> 12:26.328
Yeah.

12:26.363 --> 12:27.596
The Mini Masters.

12:27.631 --> 12:29.164
It's going on right now.

12:29.199 --> 12:31.967
The purse is only two grand,
but they spend all year

12:32.002 --> 12:34.669
bouncing balls off of windmills
just to get a shot at it.

12:34.705 --> 12:38.106
And where's this Mini Masters
Tournament being played?

12:38.142 --> 12:40.108
Sammy's Tropical Tiki
on Route 7.

12:40.144 --> 12:42.744
It's Troy's home course.

12:43.781 --> 12:45.881
He could've won.

12:47.251 --> 12:50.218
<i> So I tracked Max to Ohio,</i>
<i>then I lost him.</i>

12:50.254 --> 12:51.814
You know, he must have
found the device.

12:51.822 --> 12:53.188
Well, he's definitely up
to something.

12:53.223 --> 12:54.823
Ohio's where he lived
before he went on the run.

12:54.858 --> 12:56.124
I know, look, I'm pulling

12:56.160 --> 12:58.226
his records from Ohio
and the records

12:58.262 --> 12:59.782
of anyone he was
associated with there.

12:59.797 --> 13:01.096
What could he be planning?

13:01.131 --> 13:03.665
He doesn't need money;
I have plenty of that.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.801
Well, like you always say,
just don't jump to conclusions.

13:05.836 --> 13:08.270
Let's just concentrate
on Troy Carter's murder

13:08.305 --> 13:10.872
and why anyone would devote
their life to mini golf.

13:10.908 --> 13:12.974
That's a good question.
Yeah.

13:30.627 --> 13:32.027
So good to have you here.
See you again.

13:32.062 --> 13:33.328
Good luck today, okay?

13:33.363 --> 13:34.663
Have fun.

13:34.698 --> 13:36.164
Oh, gosh.

13:36.200 --> 13:37.599
Oh, Hunter!

13:37.634 --> 13:39.000
Hey, great to see you.
Hey, man.

13:39.036 --> 13:40.302
Good to see you, man.
Good luck today.

13:40.337 --> 13:42.270
Thank you, appreciate it.
Take care, buddy.

13:51.782 --> 13:53.215
You ever see
anything like this before?

13:53.250 --> 13:54.950
No, I...

13:54.985 --> 13:57.085
There's a hallucinatory quality

13:57.121 --> 14:00.055
reminiscent of an experience
I had taking ayahuasca once

14:00.090 --> 14:01.990
in the Andes.
Wow.

14:02.025 --> 14:04.025
But despite
its obvious childishness,

14:04.061 --> 14:08.130
this sport does seem to have an
abundance of serious adherents.

14:08.165 --> 14:09.805
Oh, come on, you think any
of these people

14:09.833 --> 14:11.666
take their game seriously enough
to commit murder?

14:11.702 --> 14:13.602
Come on!

14:13.637 --> 14:16.238
God!
Aah!

14:16.273 --> 14:17.546
I think you have
your answer right there.
Damn it!

14:17.570 --> 14:18.474
Yeah.

14:18.475 --> 14:20.008
Damn it! Damn it!

14:20.043 --> 14:21.109
Whoa! What the hell

14:21.145 --> 14:22.677
do you think
you're doing, Eric?

14:22.713 --> 14:24.846
Do you have any idea
what a tiki god costs?

14:24.882 --> 14:26.378
This is the only shot
I've missed all day, Daddy.

14:27.251 --> 14:30.819
It only takes one to lose.

14:30.854 --> 14:32.120
Hey.

14:32.156 --> 14:33.955
Sorry, but you have
to stand back over there

14:33.991 --> 14:35.257
with the spectators;
there's a tournament going on.

14:35.292 --> 14:36.424
Oh, no, I don't think so.

14:36.460 --> 14:37.926
FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth.

14:37.961 --> 14:39.794
This here is my partner,
Dr. Temperance Brennan.

14:39.830 --> 14:40.996
FBI?

14:41.031 --> 14:42.731
What happened?
Did somebody kill somebody?

14:42.766 --> 14:44.032
Yeah, Troy Carter.

14:44.067 --> 14:45.067
Carter's dead?

14:45.068 --> 14:46.334
Oh, my God, Troy's dead?

14:46.370 --> 14:47.469
That's too bad.

14:47.504 --> 14:48.503
Okay, I say that
someone's dead,

14:48.539 --> 14:50.272
and that's all you got?

14:50.307 --> 14:51.406
We just said it's sad.

14:51.441 --> 14:52.474
Now move your ass.

14:52.509 --> 14:54.309
I'm trying to make a shot here.

14:55.379 --> 14:57.746
I'm sorry?

14:57.781 --> 14:59.548
Yeah, can you move?

15:05.345 --> 15:08.112
I can't believe Troy's dead.
How-how did he die?

15:08.148 --> 15:09.981
He was shot.
In the head.

15:10.016 --> 15:11.783
Oh, my God.

15:11.818 --> 15:14.018
We loved Troy. Plus,

15:14.054 --> 15:16.888
Sammy and I put a lot
into Troy's career.

15:16.923 --> 15:18.289
How much? Time? Money?

15:18.324 --> 15:21.192
Both. I mean,
I've seen the best mini golfers

15:21.227 --> 15:23.161
come and go, but...

15:23.196 --> 15:24.065
Troy...

15:24.089 --> 15:26.331
Sammy said Troy was gonna be
the Jack Nicholson

15:26.399 --> 15:27.865
of mini golf.

15:27.901 --> 15:28.966
Jack Nicklaus, honey.

15:29.002 --> 15:30.868
Anyway, he was
counting on Troy

15:30.904 --> 15:33.805
- winning the Mini Masters this year.
- Wait,

15:33.840 --> 15:35.973
okay, how much did that cost?
Enough.

15:36.009 --> 15:38.810
Like Sammy says,
it was an investment.

15:38.845 --> 15:40.678
Couldn't have done it
without Lori here.

15:40.713 --> 15:42.795
Most of the money came
from her modeling career.

15:42.819 --> 15:43.382
Mm-hmm.

15:43.383 --> 15:44.916
I'm s...
You're a model?

15:44.951 --> 15:46.250
Why are you
surprised,

15:46.286 --> 15:48.019
Booth? Uh...
perfectly formed

15:48.054 --> 15:50.354
phalanges, the elegant
metacarpals.

15:50.390 --> 15:51.989
You're a hand model, aren't you?

15:52.025 --> 15:53.257
Oh, yes!

15:53.293 --> 15:54.926
Oh, that was
very good!

15:54.961 --> 15:57.295
Oh, Sammy, this one
here has got the gift.

15:57.330 --> 15:59.030
Yes, she does
have the gift.

15:59.065 --> 16:01.933
So, did, um,
Troy have any enemies?

16:01.968 --> 16:03.334
Troy kind of kept
to himself.

16:03.369 --> 16:05.670
I mean, all my golfers
knew him, but...

16:05.705 --> 16:07.945
he really wasn't close with any of them.
There is one guy

16:07.974 --> 16:09.774
who really seemed to
have it in for Troy.

16:09.809 --> 16:11.375
<i>One</i> guy?
Last year's

16:11.411 --> 16:14.946
Mini Masters champion, Winston Scruggs.
Come on,

16:14.981 --> 16:17.582
Winston's kind of a jerk,
but he would never kill anyone.

16:17.617 --> 16:19.350
Well, we'll determine that,
okay? Thank you.

16:19.385 --> 16:20.785
Where is he now?

16:20.820 --> 16:23.154
Out on the course.

16:28.328 --> 16:30.128
Hey.

16:30.163 --> 16:33.131
Ooh. Is this the clock?
Yeah.

16:33.166 --> 16:35.017
Hey, it's not supposed
to be in here, you know.

16:35.018 --> 16:36.802
I know.. I didn't want to leave it
in the locker room.

16:36.836 --> 16:38.669
Andie said it's pretty rare.
Valuable?

16:38.705 --> 16:40.705
She says yes, very.
Nice!

16:40.740 --> 16:41.806
Let's take a look.

16:41.841 --> 16:43.341
Uh, you know,
I really got

16:43.376 --> 16:45.209
to finish up here first, man.
Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

16:45.245 --> 16:47.044
I'm just gonna take
a quick peak to see what

16:47.080 --> 16:48.846
we're dealing with here.
You know, while you're here,

16:48.882 --> 16:50.748
I've got some bones that still
have bird guano on them.

16:50.783 --> 16:52.061
Might need to be run
through the bath again.

16:52.086 --> 16:52.719
Sure, sure.

16:52.719 --> 16:54.752
Just put them to the side--
I'll take a look at 'em

16:54.787 --> 16:56.053
as soon as
I finish up here.

16:56.089 --> 16:57.655
I also found a tiny

16:57.690 --> 17:00.324
hemorrhagic stainon the zygomatic.
The corrosive

17:00.360 --> 17:01.859
properties of the bird droppings

17:01.895 --> 17:03.828
seem to have etched the blood
into the bone.

17:03.863 --> 17:05.930
There are also striations
on the right clavicle

17:05.964 --> 17:09.099
and right fifth sternal rib.
What, knife wounds?

17:09.135 --> 17:10.300
Possibly, but
they're postmortem.

17:10.336 --> 17:12.069
Who would stab
a dead person?

17:12.105 --> 17:13.738
That's a good point;
that doesn't make sense.

17:13.772 --> 17:15.506
Hey, do you have
your phone on you?

17:15.541 --> 17:17.942
I got to get a quick picture
of this so we can figure out

17:17.977 --> 17:19.944
how to put it back together.
Ah. Right.

17:19.979 --> 17:23.079
Now, as soon as I take
this back panel off,

17:23.116 --> 17:25.983
we will know what we are dealing with.
Okay.

17:26.019 --> 17:27.919
There we go.

17:33.092 --> 17:34.926
♪ ♪

17:34.961 --> 17:36.994
Scruggs was a pro golfer--

17:37.030 --> 17:38.396
you know, real golf--

17:38.431 --> 17:41.799
but he washed out, so
he took up mini golf.

17:41.834 --> 17:45.436
He was the top dog around
here until Troy came along.

17:45.471 --> 17:47.004
That's him right...

17:47.040 --> 17:48.472
right there.

17:48.508 --> 17:50.575
All right, everybody,
let's back off. Let's go.

17:50.610 --> 17:51.475
Time out.

17:51.511 --> 17:52.910
What the hell are you doing?

17:52.946 --> 17:54.078
I'm lining up a shot here.

17:54.113 --> 17:55.279
FBI. Special Agent Booth.
We have

17:55.315 --> 17:56.781
a few questions for you,
Mr. Scruggs.

17:56.816 --> 17:58.683
Now?!
Yes,<i> now.</i>

17:58.718 --> 18:00.384
What's that you have in your
hand? Could I see that, please?

18:00.420 --> 18:02.353
I...
I. Yeah. Thank you.

18:02.388 --> 18:05.223
Wait a second-- this is the same
code I saw in Troy's notebook.

18:05.258 --> 18:06.257
It's quite interesting.

18:06.292 --> 18:07.792
It's like Newton's notes

18:07.827 --> 18:09.927
on basic physics.
This whole game's

18:09.963 --> 18:11.162
about physics, sweetheart.

18:11.197 --> 18:12.763
You got to know every
bounce, angle,

18:12.799 --> 18:14.799
pitch and lie
on every hole of the course.

18:14.834 --> 18:16.734
I could show you if you
let me get back to it.

18:16.769 --> 18:18.769
You can get back to it
after you answer a few questions.

18:18.805 --> 18:21.906
Excellent schematic
of this hole.

18:22.976 --> 18:25.376
Uh, that is my lie!

18:32.986 --> 18:35.019
Well, I believe the term is--

18:35.054 --> 18:37.989
"one in the hole"!
No, Bones, it's a "hole in one."

18:38.024 --> 18:39.257
Let's go. Over here.

18:39.292 --> 18:41.425
Ow.
I have some questions for you.

18:41.461 --> 18:42.827
Why are you
interrupting my game

18:42.862 --> 18:44.161
in the middle
of the most important

18:44.197 --> 18:46.364
sporting event
of my career?

18:46.399 --> 18:48.032
Troy Carter
was murdered.

18:48.067 --> 18:49.166
From my understanding,

18:49.202 --> 18:50.501
you two weren't
exactly friends.

18:50.536 --> 18:52.770
No, of course not--
we were rivals.

18:52.805 --> 18:54.872
Rivals?
Yeah. I didn't kill him.

18:54.907 --> 18:57.375
Well, with Troy out of the picture, it's
your tournament to lose.

18:57.410 --> 18:58.976
Sounds like a
motive to me.

18:59.012 --> 19:01.078
You don't own a rifle,
do you, Mr. Scruggs?

19:01.114 --> 19:04.248
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

19:04.284 --> 19:05.916
Everyone around here does.

19:05.952 --> 19:07.551
Am I gonna need a warrant
to look at yours?

19:07.587 --> 19:09.220
I don't know.

19:09.255 --> 19:12.089
You don't know?
Probably should talk to a lawyer before.

19:12.992 --> 19:14.525
Booth.

19:14.560 --> 19:15.226
Yeah?

19:15.261 --> 19:16.394
Blood.

19:16.429 --> 19:17.895
Blood. You wait here.

19:17.930 --> 19:19.530
I'm going to the tiki hut.

19:22.101 --> 19:24.302
Sheesh!

19:24.337 --> 19:25.703
Blood? Are you sure?

19:26.606 --> 19:27.905
Of course you're sure.

19:27.940 --> 19:30.074
And more blood,
and what appears to be

19:30.109 --> 19:32.877
tiny bone chips,
and possibly some brain matter.

19:32.912 --> 19:35.246
So he was killed here.
Appears so.

19:35.281 --> 19:37.381
Someone tried to clean this up
who obviously wasn't trained

19:37.417 --> 19:39.417
in forensics.
All right, I'll get an FBI team out here

19:39.452 --> 19:40.584
and I'll call Cam.
No, no!

19:40.620 --> 19:42.353
Booth, I want
to bring the tiki hut

19:42.388 --> 19:44.455
back to the lab.
What?! No!

19:44.490 --> 19:46.457
You can't take
my tiki hut.

19:46.492 --> 19:49.160
We're in the middle of a tournament here.
Ha-ha... if the lady

19:49.195 --> 19:51.162
wants the tiki hut
back to the lab,

19:51.197 --> 19:53.130
the tiki hut's going
back to the lab!

19:53.166 --> 19:55.499
Rally it up!

20:02.717 --> 20:05.385
Hey, what you got there?
Bone chips.

20:05.420 --> 20:06.986
Most likely pieces of
the frontal, glabella,

20:07.022 --> 20:08.755
zygomatic or nasal bones.

20:08.790 --> 20:11.558
Do you know that I found three
holes in the wall of this baby?

20:11.593 --> 20:14.327
Bullet holes?
Well, too small to <i> be</i> bullets,

20:14.362 --> 20:16.062
but most likely fragments
from the <i> same</i> bullet.

20:16.097 --> 20:17.430
The weird thing,
though, is that

20:17.466 --> 20:18.731
they were equidistant
from each other.

20:18.767 --> 20:20.166
Is that unusual?
Yeah.

20:20.202 --> 20:21.901
Very. Plus, whoever cleaned up

20:21.937 --> 20:24.904
took the bullet fragments,
so matching that golfer's rifle

20:24.940 --> 20:27.774
to the crime, it's
gonna be pretty tough.

20:29.010 --> 20:31.878
You wanted to see me?
I was about to run DNA

20:31.913 --> 20:34.681
on the piece of tissue
I found in the tiki hut

20:34.716 --> 20:36.683
when I noticed
something interesting.

20:36.718 --> 20:37.984
Take a look at this.

20:38.019 --> 20:39.519
It's from
the victim's eyebrow.

20:39.554 --> 20:40.920
There appear to be stitches,

20:40.956 --> 20:43.256
so he was injured
before he was killed.

20:43.291 --> 20:44.291
Yes, but the stitches

20:44.292 --> 20:46.526
are ordinary thread--

20:46.561 --> 20:47.660
no doctor did this.

20:47.696 --> 20:50.563
Mr. Bray found
remodeled fractures

20:50.599 --> 20:51.998
of the right

20:52.033 --> 20:54.534
two-through-four
metacarpals and scaphoid.

20:54.569 --> 20:57.837
This injury you found
could be from the same fight.

20:57.873 --> 20:59.072
Do you have any date range

20:59.107 --> 21:00.740
on the remodeling?
Ten days?

21:00.775 --> 21:01.875
Well, that's in sync

21:01.910 --> 21:03.576
with the healing
on the tissue.

21:03.612 --> 21:05.178
And I also
found this.

21:05.213 --> 21:07.847
I found antibodies
in Troy's blood

21:07.883 --> 21:09.682
from hepatitis B
and yellow fever.

21:11.152 --> 21:12.986
Oh, I have to get this.

21:14.289 --> 21:15.855
Hi, Booth.

21:15.891 --> 21:17.223
The Ohio State Police
just picked up Max.

21:17.259 --> 21:18.758
What?

21:18.793 --> 21:20.827
I knew it.
What-what is it this time?

21:20.862 --> 21:22.929
Grave robbing.

21:22.964 --> 21:25.932
Why would he do something
like that?

21:25.967 --> 21:27.066
Must have been something to do

21:27.102 --> 21:29.502
with the guy that he,
uh, dug up.

21:29.538 --> 21:31.938
Real bad guy by the name
of Marvin Barlow.

21:31.973 --> 21:34.207
I'm not familiar with Barlow.

21:34.242 --> 21:35.808
He was still on the FBI's

21:35.844 --> 21:37.544
Ten Most Wanted list.

21:37.579 --> 21:39.245
We didn't even know he was dead
until Max dug him up.

21:39.281 --> 21:41.281
Well, how did Max know?
Well, that's gonna be

21:41.316 --> 21:43.116
the first thing they ask him
when he gets here.

21:43.151 --> 21:44.784
Max is coming back?

21:44.819 --> 21:46.119
Well, of course.

21:46.154 --> 21:47.720
I mean, Barlow was
a federal fugitive. Right?

21:47.756 --> 21:49.276
Max is right in the middle
of all this.

21:51.726 --> 21:53.927
<i>I looked into the accounts</i>

21:53.962 --> 21:55.595
<i>on Troy's phone.</i>

21:55.630 --> 21:58.197
He was communicating with
someone named Darla Simms.

21:58.233 --> 21:59.699
Looked pretty steamy.

21:59.734 --> 22:00.833
That's not good.

22:00.869 --> 22:02.101
Not at all.
Why?

22:02.137 --> 22:03.937
He's a healthy male, he...
Yeah,

22:03.972 --> 22:05.805
a healthy 36-year-old male.

22:05.840 --> 22:07.373
Darla Simms is only 18.

22:07.409 --> 22:09.275
Oh.

22:09.311 --> 22:10.810
That's barely legal

22:10.845 --> 22:12.579
and totally creepy.

22:12.614 --> 22:13.813
Darla was on the circuit.

22:13.848 --> 22:15.081
She was a pro mini golfer
like Troy.

22:15.116 --> 22:16.282
She's managed by her father,

22:16.318 --> 22:18.318
who Booth said
is super protective.

22:18.353 --> 22:20.019
"Psycho" is how he put it.

22:21.723 --> 22:23.957
What the hell am I doing here?

22:23.992 --> 22:25.858
Now, look, a man has been
murdered, Mr. Simms.

22:25.894 --> 22:27.327
It happens.

22:27.362 --> 22:29.062
Right?
But life goes on.

22:29.097 --> 22:30.430
Why don't you tell that
to the tiki god

22:30.465 --> 22:31.831
you just beat the crap out of?

22:31.866 --> 22:34.701
I... I was frustrated.

22:34.736 --> 22:36.269
All right?
I'm trying to make something

22:36.304 --> 22:38.004
of my daughter's life.

22:38.039 --> 22:39.706
By playing mini golf?

22:39.741 --> 22:40.340
Yes!

22:40.375 --> 22:41.874
Yeah.

22:41.910 --> 22:43.309
Why am I here?

22:43.345 --> 22:44.877
I had no motive to kill Troy.

22:44.913 --> 22:46.012
Well, your 18-year-old daughter

22:46.047 --> 22:47.780
having sex with
a 36-year-old man...

22:47.816 --> 22:49.549
that sounds like a motive to me.
I saw them flirting,

22:49.584 --> 22:51.818
but it never went
further than that.

22:51.853 --> 22:53.553
Darla tells me everything.

22:53.588 --> 22:55.421
I think you know
that it went a lot further.

22:55.457 --> 22:57.223
Look, I get it.

22:57.258 --> 22:58.391
I'm a parent.

22:58.426 --> 22:59.892
My 18-year-old girl

22:59.928 --> 23:02.295
has sex with
a 36-year-old man?

23:02.330 --> 23:04.063
I'd want to kill him, too.

23:04.099 --> 23:05.865
Maybe it was a mistake.

23:05.900 --> 23:07.300
Right?
This guy comes along

23:07.335 --> 23:09.168
and he ruins everything
that you taught your daughter.

23:09.204 --> 23:10.370
All the training,

23:10.405 --> 23:11.738
just down the drain.

23:11.773 --> 23:12.939
Huh? So you snapped.

23:12.974 --> 23:14.374
No jury's gonna convict.

23:14.409 --> 23:16.175
I know my rights.

23:16.211 --> 23:17.944
I want a lawyer.

23:23.785 --> 23:24.985
How pissed was your dad

23:25.020 --> 23:26.719
when he found out
about you and Troy?

23:26.755 --> 23:28.254
He never found out.

23:28.289 --> 23:29.455
Sure about that?

23:29.491 --> 23:30.857
Tough to keep it from him

23:30.892 --> 23:32.158
when he's looking
over your shoulder.

23:32.193 --> 23:35.662
I didn't even care
if Daddy found out.

23:35.697 --> 23:37.897
Sleeping with Troy...

23:37.932 --> 23:40.833
with someone that good
with a putter...

23:42.737 --> 23:44.370
Do you actually mean "putter"?

23:44.406 --> 23:46.239
Hmm.

23:46.274 --> 23:48.608
Okay.

23:48.643 --> 23:50.710
If you saw
him play golf,

23:50.745 --> 23:54.147
it was pure magic.

23:54.182 --> 23:57.884
He could've been the best
mini golfer, like, ever.

23:57.919 --> 24:00.887
Well, somebody worked
Troy over pretty badly.

24:00.922 --> 24:02.955
Did he ever say
anything about that?

24:02.991 --> 24:05.024
I was there.

24:05.060 --> 24:07.260
We were at the
Wonder Vista Motel.

24:07.295 --> 24:09.696
Some guy burst in on us in bed.

24:09.731 --> 24:12.398
He grabbed Troy
and he dragged him outside.

24:12.434 --> 24:13.833
Did you see the guy that did it?

24:13.868 --> 24:15.068
The room was
so dark

24:15.103 --> 24:17.003
and it all happened so fast,

24:17.038 --> 24:19.806
but I ran to the window
and I saw this big guy

24:19.841 --> 24:21.040
stuffing Troy into his truck.

24:21.076 --> 24:22.408
It wasn't Daddy.

24:22.444 --> 24:24.444
Well, why didn't you
tell anyone about it?

24:24.479 --> 24:25.945
Who was I gonna tell?

24:25.980 --> 24:27.313
My father?

24:28.416 --> 24:29.749
Well, do you think you could

24:29.784 --> 24:31.117
describe the face you saw

24:31.152 --> 24:32.318
to one of our artists?

24:32.353 --> 24:34.787
Sure.
I want to do that.

24:34.823 --> 24:37.223
Mini golf lost
a legend.

24:37.258 --> 24:40.660
And I lost...

24:47.469 --> 24:49.368
Man, some of these
pieces are bent.

24:49.404 --> 24:51.137
Or rusted. They
don't fit together;

24:51.172 --> 24:52.505
the escapement wheel
doesn't seem to fit right.

24:52.540 --> 24:54.107
It will. It will.

24:54.142 --> 24:56.175
All we need is the lever, okay?
Look at this.

24:56.211 --> 24:58.778
Together, they're the last wheel
in the gear chain.

24:58.813 --> 25:00.246
See that?

25:00.281 --> 25:02.815
You know why I wanted
to do this, don't you?

25:02.851 --> 25:04.117
Yeah.

25:04.152 --> 25:05.384
Yeah, I think so.

25:05.420 --> 25:07.286
The cancer made you feel
like you lost control

25:07.322 --> 25:09.422
and by fixing
this clock,

25:09.457 --> 25:11.124
even if you can't fix yourself,
it gives you the sense

25:11.159 --> 25:12.825
that you're in control
over something.

25:12.861 --> 25:14.927
Wow. That's actually
kind of beautiful, Hodgins.

25:14.963 --> 25:16.395
But no.

25:16.431 --> 25:18.364
I'm doing this because
I broke the clock.

25:18.399 --> 25:20.967
And Andie is gonna kill me
if she finds out.

25:21.002 --> 25:22.135
Well, if she does find out,

25:22.170 --> 25:23.536
you'd better go with
the cancer story, man.

25:23.571 --> 25:24.971
It's like a Get Out
of Jail Free card for you.

25:26.241 --> 25:29.842
We'll fix it. We'll fix it.

25:29.878 --> 25:31.410
Grave robbing?

25:31.446 --> 25:33.946
Even for you, Dad,
that's a new low.

25:33.982 --> 25:36.215
- I didn't have any choice, baby.
- Look, why, Max?

25:36.251 --> 25:37.984
I mean, why'd you dig up
Marvin Barlow?

25:38.019 --> 25:40.052
I just had to make sure
that it was Barlow.

25:40.088 --> 25:41.387
Why?

25:41.422 --> 25:43.122
Honey, there are things

25:43.158 --> 25:44.290
you don't need to know.

25:44.325 --> 25:46.392
More secrets,

25:46.427 --> 25:47.960
more lies?

25:47.996 --> 25:49.162
I don't know why
I ever trusted you.

25:49.197 --> 25:50.830
Oh, Tempe, don't... don't...

25:50.865 --> 25:52.265
Max, you gotta give us
something here.

25:52.300 --> 25:54.100
I gave you Barlow.
Isn't that enough?

25:54.135 --> 25:55.368
I mean, you didn't even
know where he was

25:55.403 --> 25:56.803
until I dug him up.

25:56.838 --> 25:58.304
Which is why I got
the charges dropped.

25:58.339 --> 26:00.506
- And I appreciate that.
- But you're obviously

26:00.542 --> 26:02.241
still in the middle of something

26:02.277 --> 26:04.010
and you won't tell us
what it is.

26:07.282 --> 26:08.881
Since I have a daughter now,
I have to protect her.

26:08.917 --> 26:10.883
- Listen, don't do this.
- What?

26:10.919 --> 26:12.051
Dad, you're...

26:12.086 --> 26:13.286
She's clearly not
safe with you.

26:13.321 --> 26:14.787
Just give me one...

26:25.335 --> 26:27.836
Must've been
some fight, Jake.

26:27.871 --> 26:29.270
Excuse me?

26:29.306 --> 26:30.639
The fight that you got into

26:30.674 --> 26:31.840
with your brother, Troy.

26:31.875 --> 26:33.041
It was a nasty one.

26:33.076 --> 26:35.210
How did you know about that?

26:35.245 --> 26:37.245
There was a witness.
What, did you forget about her?

26:37.280 --> 26:38.747
She gave us a description.

26:38.782 --> 26:41.650
Turns out, a really good one,
in fact.

26:41.685 --> 26:43.818
He was an idiot.

26:43.854 --> 26:46.221
I caught him in bed with a kid.

26:46.256 --> 26:48.023
Darla Simms, yeah.

26:48.058 --> 26:49.824
She's 18.

26:49.860 --> 26:52.060
Like I said, a kid. And I knew
what her father was like.

26:52.062 --> 26:53.662
So you were protecting Troy.

26:53.697 --> 26:55.130
He was my
little brother,

26:55.165 --> 26:56.931
and I knew her father
was a nutcase.

26:56.967 --> 26:59.100
I dragged him out,
but he tried to go back in.

26:59.136 --> 27:01.036
That's when the fight started.
Well, we looked into the

27:01.071 --> 27:03.138
financials for your
landscaping company.

27:03.173 --> 27:05.073
Looks like Troy
leaving was pretty

27:05.108 --> 27:06.975
bad for business
there, wasn't it?

27:07.010 --> 27:09.077
How'd you get this?
Court order's

27:09.112 --> 27:11.680
a wonderful thing.
You are in a fiscal

27:11.715 --> 27:13.181
free fall, Jake.

27:13.216 --> 27:15.216
You lost a solid
third of your customer

27:15.252 --> 27:16.951
base in the last six months--

27:16.987 --> 27:18.687
since Troy started
training for mini golf.

27:18.722 --> 27:20.121
All business has
its ups and downs.

27:20.157 --> 27:21.856
We're just in
a little bit of a slump.

27:21.892 --> 27:26.728
You blamed him for ruining
everything that you built up.

27:26.763 --> 27:28.897
So what happened?
The fight get out of

27:28.932 --> 27:32.200
control?
He was my brother, for God's sake.

27:32.235 --> 27:35.870
Just curious, uh... You, uh...

27:35.906 --> 27:37.806
You own a rifle, Jake?

27:37.841 --> 27:39.307
Yeah.

27:39.342 --> 27:40.975
Why?

27:41.011 --> 27:44.479
Just didn't want that
search warrant to go to waste.

27:55.258 --> 27:57.158
We should really
be focusing on the clavicle,

27:57.194 --> 27:58.727
the humerus and the rib.

27:58.762 --> 28:00.795
Can't rush guano
removal, my friend,

28:00.831 --> 28:02.397
so we might as well

28:02.432 --> 28:06.267
finish up with the clock
while we wait.

28:06.303 --> 28:07.969
All right--

28:08.004 --> 28:10.872
moment of truth.
Okay, I mean, it should work, right?

28:10.907 --> 28:12.273
The escapement
and-and the stem gear,

28:12.309 --> 28:14.209
they all fit together
the way that they should.

28:14.244 --> 28:16.444
We've done everything right.
Well...

28:16.480 --> 28:20.348
why don't you wind it and see?

28:35.766 --> 28:36.900
Nothing.

28:36.924 --> 28:38.267
Okay, maybe you should
wind it some more.

28:38.268 --> 28:39.868
That's how I broke it
to begin with.

28:39.903 --> 28:41.536
Just...

28:47.010 --> 28:49.344
Man, I am so screwed. What am
I supposed to tell Andie now?

28:49.379 --> 28:51.079
Don't worry about it.
I got you covered.

28:51.114 --> 28:52.847
How?
Well, this

28:52.883 --> 28:55.016
is our backup clock.

28:55.051 --> 28:58.253
As soon as the clock
exploded in the bone room,

28:58.288 --> 29:00.388
I figured we
needed a plan B.

29:00.423 --> 29:02.056
Where'd you get this?

29:02.092 --> 29:03.558
Craigslist. Nine bucks.

29:03.593 --> 29:05.160
Nine?

29:05.195 --> 29:07.395
So Andie's clock isn't worth anything?
I don't know,

29:07.430 --> 29:10.498
maybe nine bucks was a fortune
when her grandmother bought it.

29:10.534 --> 29:13.334
I can't swap clocks
on her. I mean,

29:13.370 --> 29:16.171
Andie's grandmother's clock has
all these little nicks on it.

29:16.206 --> 29:18.406
Nine bucks or a million,
it means a lot to her.

29:18.441 --> 29:21.342
She'll notice.
I thought you might say that.

29:21.378 --> 29:23.411
Then we take the inner
mechanisms of this clock

29:23.446 --> 29:26.014
and we put it into her
grandmother's clock.

29:26.049 --> 29:27.849
Dude, you're a genius.

29:27.884 --> 29:29.484
Yeah, I've heard that before.

29:29.519 --> 29:31.152
Oh, and your bones are done.

29:31.188 --> 29:33.721
See? Life is grand.

29:41.097 --> 29:43.464
Not so grand for the victim--

29:43.500 --> 29:45.333
these are bullet wounds.

29:47.037 --> 29:48.970
<i>So these are the three</i>

29:49.005 --> 29:50.605
bullet holes that you found
that were obscured

29:50.640 --> 29:52.807
by the corrosion
from the bird guano.

29:52.843 --> 29:54.275
One on the
right clavicle,

29:54.311 --> 29:56.978
one on the right fifth
sternal rib and a small nick

29:57.013 --> 29:57.932
on the right humerus.

29:57.956 --> 29:59.882
Along with the head wound,
that means the victim

29:59.883 --> 30:01.182
was shot four times.

30:01.218 --> 30:02.517
Well, he was hit four times,

30:02.552 --> 30:05.153
but not necessarily
by the same shooter.

30:05.188 --> 30:07.388
Based on the angles at which
the bullets hit the bones,

30:07.424 --> 30:11.259
their trajectories come from
four totally different angles.

30:11.294 --> 30:14.195
Four shooters?
Well, it appears that way.

30:16.533 --> 30:19.367
Nothing about this case
follows the laws of logic.

30:19.402 --> 30:21.269
The injuries make
no sense, Booth.

30:21.304 --> 30:22.971
Okay, look, usually
you're not this upset.

30:23.006 --> 30:25.940
Maybe it's not about the case.
No, no. Look at these.

30:25.976 --> 30:28.109
Do these bullet hits make sense
to you? I don't think so.

30:28.144 --> 30:30.378
I really don't believe you're
this upset over bullet hits.

30:30.413 --> 30:33.248
What else would it be?
Well, I don't know, maybe Max?

30:33.283 --> 30:35.138
Ma... That's absurd, Booth.

30:35.162 --> 30:36.919
That's already been resolved.
Maybe you should just

30:36.920 --> 30:38.533
give him a call and just,
uh, try to work things out.

30:38.557 --> 30:39.388
No, he's not

30:39.389 --> 30:42.357
answering his phone, Booth, and
his car isn't at his apartment,

30:42.392 --> 30:44.359
so talking isn't an option, is it?
Right,

30:44.394 --> 30:45.627
I understand, you're right.

30:45.662 --> 30:48.029
Got it.
Well, look at this file.

30:48.064 --> 30:51.266
Wendell found three more
bullet wounds suggesting

30:51.301 --> 30:53.368
multiple shooters
and Hodgins

30:53.403 --> 30:55.870
found what appeared to
be three bullet holes

30:55.906 --> 30:58.573
inside the tiki hut,
but they're too small

30:58.608 --> 31:00.842
to be from bullets.
Probably

31:00.877 --> 31:02.310
from fragments.
Well, that could

31:02.345 --> 31:04.312
be the work of one shooter.
Impossible.

31:04.347 --> 31:07.048
These bullets hit from
three different angles.

31:07.083 --> 31:09.017
Could be a multiple
impact bullet.

31:09.052 --> 31:10.618
What's that?
New type of ammo.

31:10.654 --> 31:13.488
The Bureau just
sent us this video. Watch.

31:13.523 --> 31:17.191
Note that when the multiple
impact bullet exits the barrel

31:17.227 --> 31:21.162
of the gun it splits into three
separate smaller projectiles

31:21.197 --> 31:23.131
held together
by Kevlar strands.

31:23.166 --> 31:25.400
Exactly.
I made a little reenactment

31:25.435 --> 31:27.435
to explain how Troy was killed.

31:27.470 --> 31:30.004
The killer confronted Troy
on the mini golf course,

31:30.040 --> 31:31.406
shooting him
in the chest.

31:31.441 --> 31:33.141
Causing the clavicle,
sternal rib

31:33.176 --> 31:34.409
and humerus wounds.

31:34.444 --> 31:35.877
Which would have been
survivable.

31:35.912 --> 31:37.378
Right, so my theory is

31:37.414 --> 31:39.380
that the killer shot
him in the chest,

31:39.416 --> 31:41.516
and then Troy ran
to the tiki hut

31:41.551 --> 31:42.984
and hid inside.

31:43.019 --> 31:45.520
So the killer pursued him
to finish the job.

31:45.555 --> 31:47.088
Exactly.
The killer found him

31:47.123 --> 31:48.923
and shot him
in the head

31:48.959 --> 31:51.159
while Troy was on
the inside looking out.

31:51.194 --> 31:53.161
And the striations
on the bones?

31:53.196 --> 31:54.429
Caused when the killer pulled on

31:54.464 --> 31:56.431
the Kevlar straps
to release the bullets.

31:56.466 --> 31:57.706
This type of ammo
is pretty new.

31:57.734 --> 31:59.567
We should be able
to find out who bought it.

32:02.130 --> 32:04.726
Security cameras at Angelo's
Gun and Sport show the owner

32:04.726 --> 32:06.092
of the mini golf place buying the ammo.
Wait a second.

32:06.128 --> 32:07.160
Why would Sammy
Tucker kill him?

32:07.195 --> 32:08.928
Okay, Troy was
his meal ticket.

32:08.964 --> 32:11.164
No, Troy was gonna be his own
meal ticket. Check this out.

32:11.199 --> 32:13.566
Troy was planning a trip
to South Africa.

32:13.602 --> 32:15.902
Angela found that Troy applied
for an expedited passport

32:15.937 --> 32:17.637
just two weeks
before his murder.

32:17.672 --> 32:19.639
The yellow fever antibodies
that Cam found

32:19.674 --> 32:20.874
are from vaccinations.

32:20.909 --> 32:22.609
Why was he going
to South Africa?

32:22.644 --> 32:24.210
There's a world championship
mini golf tournament

32:24.246 --> 32:25.645
in Johannesburg this month.

32:25.680 --> 32:28.114
The purse is big-- 20 grand.
You all right?

32:28.150 --> 32:30.250
I just need one of them
back scratchers. That's all.

32:30.285 --> 32:33.052
Means, motive and opportunity.
I love that.

32:35.624 --> 32:37.190
Why am I here?

32:37.225 --> 32:38.591
Why were you guys
searching my house?

32:38.627 --> 32:40.026
Shut up and sit down,
will you?

32:40.061 --> 32:41.761
We're looking
for a murder weapon.

32:41.797 --> 32:43.263
Sort of our thing.

32:43.298 --> 32:45.165
Murder weapon?
I didn't kill anybody.

32:45.200 --> 32:46.699
What are you talking about?

32:46.735 --> 32:48.701
We also found
your special ammo.

32:48.737 --> 32:50.804
See, our lab connected it
to the wounds on the victim.

32:50.839 --> 32:52.705
I can't be the only one

32:52.741 --> 32:54.741
in the state
who bought that ammo.

32:54.776 --> 32:57.210
No, but you're the only suspect
in Troy's murder who bought it.

32:57.245 --> 32:59.846
Why would I kill Troy?
He was my friend.

32:59.881 --> 33:02.282
Your boy Troy was about
to bail on you.

33:02.317 --> 33:04.984
What? No.
Troy and I were tight.

33:05.020 --> 33:06.386
Troy got his shots,

33:06.421 --> 33:08.321
applied for a passport
and a visitor's visa

33:08.356 --> 33:10.156
to play mini golf
in Johannesburg, South Africa.

33:10.192 --> 33:12.125
That is a beautiful course,
by the way.

33:12.160 --> 33:13.660
Fourth hole got a waterfall.

33:13.695 --> 33:15.128
Enough with the waterfalls,
okay?

33:15.163 --> 33:17.096
Yeah.
All that time

33:17.132 --> 33:18.698
and money you invested
into Troy,

33:18.733 --> 33:21.134
and your buddy was gonna
just leave you high and dry.

33:21.169 --> 33:23.703
No. You got it all wrong.

33:23.738 --> 33:25.839
I was going
to South Africa with him.

33:25.874 --> 33:27.774
I was paying for the whole trip.

33:27.809 --> 33:28.842
We got it all wrong?
I'm sorry.

33:28.877 --> 33:30.743
Can you prove that?
Sure.

33:30.779 --> 33:32.445
I got receipts for everything.

33:34.349 --> 33:36.449
Troy was my
best friend.

33:37.853 --> 33:41.254
I wish it was me that got shot
instead of him.

33:44.259 --> 33:46.793
Did you test the hemorrhagic
stain on the zygomatic?

33:46.828 --> 33:49.696
Test it? It was etched into
the bone by the bird guano.

33:49.731 --> 33:51.431
So you just assumed
it was blood?

33:51.466 --> 33:53.066
What else could it be?

33:53.101 --> 33:54.467
That's not an answer,
Mr. Bray.

33:54.503 --> 33:56.236
That's an assumption.

33:56.271 --> 33:57.737
I'm sorry.

33:57.772 --> 34:00.039
I-I should have
tested it.

34:00.075 --> 34:02.141
Mr. Bray,

34:02.177 --> 34:05.211
I understand that fixing
your new girlfriend's clock

34:05.247 --> 34:06.713
may be a great way

34:06.748 --> 34:08.348
to impress her, but here,

34:08.382 --> 34:10.550
your job is to impress me.

34:15.123 --> 34:17.023
A pretty small sample.

34:17.058 --> 34:19.659
I gave half of it to Dr. Saroyan
so she could run DNA.

34:19.694 --> 34:22.128
Well, whatever it was etched
pretty deep into the bone

34:22.163 --> 34:23.763
by the bird guano.

34:23.797 --> 34:25.264
I'm gonna need
to break this down

34:25.300 --> 34:27.033
to determine
the chemical content.

34:27.068 --> 34:28.333
What's that?

34:28.370 --> 34:30.069
This? This is my new

34:30.105 --> 34:31.971
particle size
distribution analyzer.

34:32.007 --> 34:34.239
Cam bought it for me.
She just doesn't know it yet.

34:34.275 --> 34:37.243
All right, here we go.

34:37.279 --> 34:41.114
Nitrocellulose, butyl acetate,
dibutyl phthalate,

34:41.149 --> 34:43.049
camphor, Red No. 7
and Red No. 34.

34:43.083 --> 34:45.685
Not blood. I don't blame
Dr. B if she fires me.

34:45.719 --> 34:47.152
No, it's red nail polish.

34:47.188 --> 34:48.922
That little piece of bone
you gave me

34:48.956 --> 34:50.389
was most likely a human nail,

34:50.425 --> 34:51.958
judging from the
keratin content.

34:51.993 --> 34:53.326
I'm running the DNA right now.

34:53.360 --> 34:54.994
Well, that makes sense,
based on the nail polish

34:55.030 --> 34:56.262
we just found in the sample.

34:56.297 --> 34:57.738
Excellent.
That looks very expensive.

34:57.766 --> 34:58.965
Did I buy it?

34:59.000 --> 35:00.767
Yes! Yes, you did.

35:00.802 --> 35:02.435
And I am very grateful.

35:02.470 --> 35:04.804
I'm sure the prosecutor
will be, as well.

35:11.880 --> 35:14.013
<i>Lori, there were</i>
<i>only three people</i>

35:14.049 --> 35:15.381
at the miniature golf

35:15.417 --> 35:17.283
the night that Troy Carter
was murdered.

35:17.319 --> 35:20.720
It was your husband,
Troy and you.

35:20.755 --> 35:24.057
You can't make me testify
against my husband.

35:24.092 --> 35:27.060
There's some law about that,
isn't there?

35:27.095 --> 35:29.295
Look, your husband
didn't kill Troy Carter.

35:29.331 --> 35:30.763
You did.

35:31.933 --> 35:33.266
That's ridiculous.

35:33.301 --> 35:35.635
A piece of nail was found
on the victim.

35:35.670 --> 35:37.904
DNA tests confirm
that it came from you.

35:37.939 --> 35:39.505
You thought you
were being smart

35:39.541 --> 35:43.109
by pulling off those
Kevlar straps from the victim,

35:43.144 --> 35:45.979
but, uh, that's how
you cut your nail.

35:48.850 --> 35:51.184
Why'd you do it, Lori?

35:52.120 --> 35:53.486
I should have come clean.

35:53.521 --> 35:54.787
I know.

35:54.823 --> 35:56.289
It was self-defense.

35:56.324 --> 35:57.523
He attacked you?

35:57.559 --> 35:59.292
He attacked my life.

35:59.327 --> 36:01.094
That's the same thing, right?

36:01.129 --> 36:03.296
He took Sammy
from me.

36:03.331 --> 36:05.932
They spent every minute
together.

36:05.967 --> 36:08.368
I was just a couple
of beautiful hands

36:08.403 --> 36:10.336
that could pay the bills.

36:10.372 --> 36:12.305
So, when they
came home that night,

36:12.340 --> 36:15.308
drunk, and told me they
were going to Africa...

36:15.343 --> 36:17.577
When Sammy
passed out,

36:17.612 --> 36:20.413
I took his gun and...

36:23.118 --> 36:24.784
I'm a family-values person.

36:24.819 --> 36:26.386
I was saving my marriage.

36:26.421 --> 36:28.221
That's self-defense, isn't it?

36:28.256 --> 36:30.590
Is she serious?

36:30.625 --> 36:32.925
That's not self-defense, Lori.

36:32.961 --> 36:36.929
Okay?
Killing Troy is murder.

36:38.400 --> 36:41.834
But Sammy would be lost
without me now.

36:41.870 --> 36:45.538

Uh... no.

37:40.595 --> 37:44.564
Andie, I have a
confession to make.

37:44.599 --> 37:47.600
Um, I was winding your
clock this morning,

37:47.635 --> 37:49.802
and... I broke it.

37:49.838 --> 37:52.572
Oh, Wendell, no...
I'm sorry. I-I really am.

37:52.607 --> 37:54.307
But-but it's okay.

37:54.342 --> 37:55.608
I fixed it.

37:55.643 --> 37:58.611
Um, well, Hodgins and I did.

38:00.348 --> 38:02.315
But you didn't break it.

38:02.350 --> 38:04.450
That clock never worked.

38:04.486 --> 38:07.286
It didn't even work
when Grandma was alive.

38:07.322 --> 38:09.222
What?
Yeah.

38:09.257 --> 38:11.557
After Grandpa died,
it stopped working.

38:11.593 --> 38:15.194
She thought it was a sign,
so she never got it fixed.

38:15.230 --> 38:18.197
You must have freaked.

38:18.233 --> 38:20.833
Mm. Yeah.

38:20.869 --> 38:22.268
Aw.

38:22.303 --> 38:24.437
Well,

38:24.472 --> 38:26.506
it works now. I hope that's okay.

38:26.541 --> 38:29.208
If not, I can always
break it for real.

38:29.244 --> 38:31.677
It's perfect.

38:31.713 --> 38:34.347
You know what that means,
don't you?

38:34.382 --> 38:36.582
That I should quit my job
and become a clocksmith?

38:36.618 --> 38:38.351
No.

38:38.386 --> 38:41.420
It means that this is
our clock now.

38:41.456 --> 38:45.258
It's marking our time together.

Hi.
I hope leftovers

39:04.612 --> 39:07.146
are okay.
Christine wanted the l...

39:08.416 --> 39:10.316
Why are you here?

39:10.351 --> 39:13.152
Well, because I...
can talk to you now.

39:13.188 --> 39:15.054
Because now you've had time
to construct a new lie?

39:15.089 --> 39:17.123
Come on. Just give him
a chance. That's all.

39:17.158 --> 39:19.091
I did.
I tried to call.

39:19.127 --> 39:22.695
I stopped over, and
he'd already disappeared again.

39:22.730 --> 39:24.630
I had to go back
to Ohio. Had to go

39:24.666 --> 39:27.200
and take something from
the, uh, evidence locker

39:27.235 --> 39:29.202
in the coroner's office.
Oh,

39:29.237 --> 39:31.370
so you went back
to steal something?

39:31.406 --> 39:34.507
No. No. Retrieve.

39:37.145 --> 39:40.112
What is this?

39:40.148 --> 39:42.715
I remember this ring.

39:42.750 --> 39:44.584
I lost it when I was little.

39:44.619 --> 39:46.085
You didn't lose it.

39:46.120 --> 39:48.120
Barlow took it off you
when you were asleep.

39:48.507 --> 39:49.940
Showed it to me
the next day,

39:49.976 --> 39:51.676
said it was proof
he could kill you

39:51.711 --> 39:53.644
any time he wanted
unless I did

39:53.680 --> 39:55.913
whatever he said.
What kind of psycho sneaks

39:55.949 --> 39:58.716
into a kid's room like that to make a point?
Well, you don't get

39:58.750 --> 40:00.717
on the Ten Most Wanted
list for nothing.

40:00.752 --> 40:04.554
That's why I couldn't
tell you about this.

40:04.590 --> 40:06.456
So...

40:06.492 --> 40:09.493
when you left us, that's why?

40:09.528 --> 40:12.162
Yes.

40:12.197 --> 40:15.532
Yes. But 12 years ago,

40:15.567 --> 40:17.033
he disappeared,

40:17.069 --> 40:19.603
so I came back.

40:19.638 --> 40:22.038
But I was always looking
over my shoulder to make sure

40:22.074 --> 40:25.041
that your family was safe.

40:27.012 --> 40:31.047
I wish it still fit.
I loved this ring.

40:31.083 --> 40:32.949
Tempe,

40:32.986 --> 40:37.088
I know that you
can't forgive me.

40:37.122 --> 40:41.091
But I am so sorry.

40:42.629 --> 40:45.630
Grandpa!

40:45.664 --> 40:48.798
Oh. Hey, beautiful.

40:48.834 --> 40:51.735
Are you going
to have dinner with us?

40:54.473 --> 40:58.008
Of course, sweetheart. And look,
Grandpa brought you a present.

40:58.043 --> 41:00.910
Thank you, Grandpa.

41:00.947 --> 41:02.613
I love it.
I think the lasagna is burning.

41:02.649 --> 41:03.948
Uh, I'll get it,
I'll get it...

41:03.982 --> 41:05.815
You guys go sit down,
you go relax. I...

41:05.851 --> 41:07.250
I'll take care of the, uh...
Okay.

41:07.286 --> 41:09.886
Can we play Ready Set Fun?

41:09.921 --> 41:13.156
Okay, but I am
Tom Foolery.

41:13.191 --> 41:15.058
Better be careful. Your mom gets
really mad when she loses.

41:15.094 --> 41:16.534
That's not true.
You cheated

41:16.562 --> 41:18.663
last time.
Frankie Fireworks

41:18.697 --> 41:21.164
doesn't cheat.
Wendy Whoopee does.

41:21.199 --> 41:24.430
No. The rules clearly state
that if you land on a star

41:24.431 --> 41:26.311
and you're sweet as sugar, you can...
Just play.
