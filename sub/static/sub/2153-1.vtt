00:18.728 --> 00:20.104
Stop!

00:20.312 --> 00:22.481
You're supposed to stop
for people who need help.

00:23.941 --> 00:27.319
Not so fast, Barry Allen.
Forget about them.

00:27.528 --> 00:30.072
You can't change other people.
Just a waste of energy.

00:30.281 --> 00:31.699
- But...
- Barry...

00:31.907 --> 00:34.577
when I was a little girl,
Grandma taught me a prayer:

00:34.785 --> 00:36.912
Accept the things you cannot change.

00:37.121 --> 00:39.331
Have the courage
to change the things you can...

00:39.540 --> 00:42.376
and have the wisdom
to know the difference.

00:42.835 --> 00:44.462
I don't totally get that.

00:46.130 --> 00:48.299
You will.

00:49.008 --> 00:50.634
Now, all we need is a phone.

00:53.971 --> 00:56.223
There's a gas station.

00:56.432 --> 00:58.976
- Race you.
- Barry!

01:37.515 --> 01:39.183
Mom.

02:00.037 --> 02:02.665
And we may never know
exactly what happened...

02:02.873 --> 02:05.793
a break-in gone wrong,
a disturbed mind.

02:06.001 --> 02:10.172
But we do know that this was a crime
and a tragedy.

02:10.381 --> 02:14.426
And as we commit Nora
to the care of our Lord...

02:14.635 --> 02:19.348
we know her son, Barry, will need
all our prayers and help to see him...

02:19.557 --> 02:21.392
<i>through this terrible loss.</i>

02:25.688 --> 02:28.858
Happy birthday, Mom.
I'm so sorry.

02:29.066 --> 02:31.360
- I should've been there.
- What?

02:31.569 --> 02:35.364
If I just ran a little faster,
I'd have been there.

02:35.573 --> 02:38.701
Barry, you were just a boy.
There was nothing you could've done.

02:38.909 --> 02:40.035
We don't know that.

02:40.244 --> 02:42.955
If I'd been there,
maybe I could've stopped it.

02:43.164 --> 02:44.206
I could've saved her.

02:44.415 --> 02:46.167
Come on, stop doing this to yourself.

02:46.375 --> 02:48.043
What was that saying your mother had?

02:48.252 --> 02:50.921
About accepting the things
you can't change?

03:00.389 --> 03:02.558
Well, this is something I can change.

03:02.766 --> 03:04.602
A break-in at the Flash Museum.

03:04.810 --> 03:07.646
- See you later?
- You better.

03:33.130 --> 03:34.256
Well, Flash.

03:34.465 --> 03:38.844
Once again, it looks like you're the bottom
and I'm the top.

03:48.270 --> 03:50.064
Mirror Master and Heat Wave.

03:50.272 --> 03:53.108
Going to a lot of trouble
to steal my old junk, aren't you?

04:17.925 --> 04:20.052
Exhibit's closed, Top.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.763
Captains Boomerang and Cold.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.140
The gang's all here.

05:06.348 --> 05:10.811
And I thought you forgot about us
as soon as you sent us off to prison.

05:11.020 --> 05:13.188
So this little reunion is about revenge?

05:13.397 --> 05:16.608
Not really.
Offing you is just a bonus part of the job.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.527
Job? Who hired you?

05:18.736 --> 05:22.114
No offense, none of you clowns
are smart enough to pull this off.

05:22.323 --> 05:24.575
You're quite right, of course, Flash.

05:26.285 --> 05:29.204
I knew using these morons
would put you off your guard.

05:29.413 --> 05:32.207
- Hey.
- They're motivated by greed.

05:32.416 --> 05:35.711
They lack the commitment,
the absolute focus...

05:35.919 --> 05:38.047
- To kill me.
- Erase you.

05:38.255 --> 05:41.383
I'm gonna bring this shrine to your ego
down on your head.

05:41.592 --> 05:45.387
Along with 10 square blocks
of Central City and everyone around.

05:45.596 --> 05:49.016
What? What are you talking about?
We didn't bring any bombs.

05:49.224 --> 05:51.894
Oh, but I did.

05:55.230 --> 05:58.108
- What is this?
- Something I attached to your belts...

05:58.317 --> 05:59.735
as I made my entrance.

06:01.195 --> 06:04.406
I wouldn't unbuckle if I were you.
You'll just set them off.

06:04.615 --> 06:05.824
It's me you want, Thawne.

06:06.033 --> 06:08.911
You don't have to kill
thousands of innocents to bring me down.

06:09.119 --> 06:11.622
No. No, I don't.

06:11.830 --> 06:17.169
But I choose to, knowing it will
make your last moments pure agony.

06:17.378 --> 06:18.420
Good bye.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.301
You can't escape, Flash.

06:24.510 --> 06:28.847
The adhesive will never completely liquefy,
regardless of speed.

06:29.056 --> 06:31.141
I'm counting on that.

06:34.645 --> 06:36.438
Now you got not choice, Thawne.

06:36.647 --> 06:39.316
Disarm the bombs
or you blow up with us.

06:40.609 --> 06:41.735
Very well.

06:41.944 --> 06:44.446
If it means shattering
your golden throne in history...

06:44.655 --> 06:47.950
linking your name forever
to this city's darkest hour...

06:48.158 --> 06:50.619
then my life is a small price to pay.

06:53.997 --> 06:55.082
I agree.

06:57.251 --> 06:59.503
Your lives aren't worth much.

07:01.338 --> 07:04.174
But Flash's life is.

07:12.808 --> 07:15.978
- You called them.
- You've got your posse, I've got mine.

07:16.186 --> 07:18.564
Clearly, you should never do this stuff
without me.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.607
You end up with crap all over yourself.

07:22.025 --> 07:25.404
Focus, GL. Bombs. Batman?

07:25.612 --> 07:26.989
It's future tech.

07:27.197 --> 07:29.992
Difficult to disarm without
setting them off, even for me.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.785
I could try to vaporize the bombs.

07:31.994 --> 07:34.872
Yes, but you'd be vaporizing
the Rogues as well.

07:35.080 --> 07:38.000
Diana's right. What's plan B?

07:41.295 --> 07:43.213
How do we shut off these charges?

07:44.256 --> 07:47.384
You can't. We'll all be dead, shortly.

07:48.010 --> 07:49.636
The truth hurts, doesn't it?

07:49.845 --> 07:51.013
We're out of options.

07:51.221 --> 07:54.475
Each of you take one of the Rogues
as far from Central City as you can.

07:54.683 --> 07:57.728
We'll attempt to disarm the devices
once sufficiently isolated.

08:00.522 --> 08:02.274
I'm not going to just leave you here.

08:02.483 --> 08:04.318
Lantern, we're running out of time.

08:04.526 --> 08:06.862
Hal, go.

08:32.095 --> 08:35.265
I'd suck it in if I were you.

08:41.897 --> 08:45.317
- Aren't you gonna do something?
- I am.

08:48.111 --> 08:50.781
I've got a million microbes
eating the bomb's wiring.

08:58.455 --> 09:00.749
Waiting is the worst part.

10:26.585 --> 10:28.462
You may have minimized
the destruction...

10:28.670 --> 10:31.673
but the final bomb will still turn
this monument to your ego...

10:31.882 --> 10:33.467
into your own tomb.

10:36.345 --> 10:38.722
What are you doing?
You can't escape.

10:38.930 --> 10:41.892
You can't reach the bomb to disarm it.
You're going to die.

10:43.560 --> 10:46.063
You may have my powers, Thawne...

10:47.189 --> 10:50.359
but you have almost zero imagination
about using them.

10:56.531 --> 10:59.993
Looks like 25th-century technology
is pretty delicate.

11:10.545 --> 11:14.091
I've notified S.T.A.R. Labs to ready a
cozy little cell for you, professor.

11:14.299 --> 11:16.551
I understand the food's not great there,
Zoom.

11:16.760 --> 11:19.846
Enjoy your petty little victories, Flash.

11:20.055 --> 11:24.726
But no matter how fast you run,
you can't save everyone.

11:24.935 --> 11:27.562
Not the ones that matter to you.

11:29.231 --> 11:33.527
Best to keep your mouth shut
if you don't want bugs in your teeth.

11:36.571 --> 11:38.573
Thawne's a classic sociopath.

11:38.782 --> 11:41.743
They have a knack for knowing
just what will get under your skin.

11:41.952 --> 11:44.496
Yeah. They do.

11:45.163 --> 11:47.124
You Okay?

11:47.833 --> 11:50.460
Don't worry about me, Bats. I'm fine.

11:50.669 --> 11:52.963
Nothing I can't run off.

12:14.234 --> 12:17.195
Look who's just joined
the land of the living.

12:20.031 --> 12:23.452
I don't mean to interrupt your beauty
sleep, Lord knows you need it...

12:23.660 --> 12:26.580
but the Elongated Kid murderer
isn't gonna catch himself.

12:26.788 --> 12:30.333
- Elongated Man was murdered?
- Elongated Kid.

12:31.334 --> 12:32.461
What?

12:32.669 --> 12:37.299
Director Singh wants us pulling
all-nighters until we close this case.

12:37.507 --> 12:38.550
Hey, what's going on?

12:38.759 --> 12:41.052
<i>We interrupt our programming
to bring breaking news.</i>

12:41.261 --> 12:42.846
<i>We're live outside the Cold Museum.</i>

12:43.054 --> 12:44.973
<i>Citizen Cold
is battling Captain Boomerang.</i>

12:45.182 --> 12:48.643
<i>Reportedly, the confrontation began
inside the museum moments ago.</i>

12:48.852 --> 12:50.312
Cold is on the loose already?

12:50.520 --> 12:52.939
Do we really have to learn
this stuff on TV?

12:53.148 --> 12:55.150
Doesn't anyone call the cops anymore?

12:55.358 --> 12:57.194
Looks like a power struggle
in the Rogues.

12:57.402 --> 12:59.321
- Who are the Rogues?
- The Rogues.

12:59.529 --> 13:00.697
Flash's worst enemies?

13:00.906 --> 13:04.785
Bent on Flash's destruction
so they can take over Central City?

13:04.993 --> 13:07.996
Okay, we'll continue
this hilarious leg-pulling later.

13:08.205 --> 13:10.999
After the Flash has taken care
of Citizen Cold.

13:19.716 --> 13:22.052
Barry, are you all right?

13:23.512 --> 13:24.554
Mom?

13:30.894 --> 13:32.229
Mom.

13:33.480 --> 13:36.441
That was a nasty spill,
even for you.

13:36.650 --> 13:38.068
Let me see your head.

13:39.236 --> 13:42.489
I'm fine. Mom.

13:44.241 --> 13:46.493
It's you. You're here.

13:46.701 --> 13:48.495
Well, of course I'm here.

13:48.703 --> 13:51.289
You promised me
you'd take me to dinner on my birthday.

13:51.498 --> 13:55.418
It's my birthday.
The end of the world can't stop that.

13:59.756 --> 14:02.551
You forgot. It's okay, Barry.

14:02.759 --> 14:05.595
It's easy for a busy young man
to forget his old mom.

14:12.102 --> 14:14.563
I could never forget you.

14:14.771 --> 14:17.065
Oh, my.

14:17.732 --> 14:21.236
Barry, what's gotten into you?
Are you all right?

14:21.444 --> 14:25.490
People have been acting so strangely with
this terrible war hanging over their heads.

14:25.699 --> 14:28.535
War? What? No, Mom, I'm fine.

14:28.743 --> 14:32.289
But everything else has changed,
and I have to find out why.

14:32.497 --> 14:34.583
It probably has something
to do with me being...

14:34.791 --> 14:37.085
- Gay?
- What? No.

14:37.294 --> 14:39.588
It's okay. I love you no matter what.

14:39.796 --> 14:44.467
Mom, it's not that. It's something else.

14:48.763 --> 14:50.432
Brace yourself for a shock.

14:50.640 --> 14:54.185
I'm the Flash.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.438
What's the Flash?

14:56.646 --> 14:59.691
You know, the Flash.
Fastest man alive?

14:59.900 --> 15:02.569
Fights crime?
Very famous superhero?

15:02.777 --> 15:07.407
A superhero?
You mean like Batman?

16:25.068 --> 16:26.861
Where's the Joker?

16:28.822 --> 16:30.824
Where, Yo-Yo?

16:31.574 --> 16:33.994
Tell me where the Joker's funhouse
is this time.

16:34.202 --> 16:35.745
While you can still talk.

16:36.246 --> 16:40.750
It's on the tip of my tongue.

16:41.209 --> 16:42.752
Let me help you get it off.

16:44.629 --> 16:48.925
Judge Dent was kidnapped last night.
Where did the Joker take him?

16:51.886 --> 16:55.557
Even if I did know,
it wouldn't do you any good, Bats.

16:55.765 --> 16:58.727
- He's probably already dead.
- Then so are you.

17:10.113 --> 17:13.407
Cyborg? I surrender.

17:13.616 --> 17:15.242
To you.

17:15.452 --> 17:16.786
Smart.

17:19.289 --> 17:22.500
- Batman.
- You should have let her hit the pavement.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.252
- You shouldn't have thrown her.
- She slipped.

17:25.462 --> 17:28.131
- Aren't you wondering how I found you?
- Thermal vision.

17:28.339 --> 17:29.466
Cybernetic hearing.

17:29.674 --> 17:32.552
And total access to every camera
on the grid.

17:32.761 --> 17:36.014
Must be a nice perk for being
in the president's back pocket.

17:36.222 --> 17:37.974
I've told you it's not like that.

17:38.183 --> 17:40.602
As national security advisor,
I can help more people.

17:40.810 --> 17:43.021
Like that murdering psychopath?

17:43.229 --> 17:45.899
Maybe you should go help people
in some other town.

17:46.107 --> 17:47.817
We're trying to help all the people...

17:48.026 --> 17:50.361
while there's still a world left.
We need you.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.363
"We"?

17:54.324 --> 17:57.077
Hologram party. Ingenious.

17:57.285 --> 17:59.120
Saves a fortune on snacks.

17:59.329 --> 18:06.002
Enchantress, Pied Piper, Citizen Cold,
Shade, Sandman, The Shazam Kids.

18:06.669 --> 18:10.298
It's Batman. Seriously, Batman.

18:10.507 --> 18:14.177
- He's older than I thought.
- But I'm not hard of hearing.

18:16.679 --> 18:19.307
You know why we're here, Batman.
War.

18:19.516 --> 18:21.726
Over 100 million people died...

18:21.935 --> 18:25.105
when Atlantis sank
Western Europe into the ocean.

18:25.313 --> 18:27.398
Another 32 million slaughtered...

18:27.607 --> 18:29.818
when the Amazons
invaded the United Kingdom...

18:30.026 --> 18:31.820
and renamed it New Themyscira.

18:32.028 --> 18:34.197
We have to take down Aquaman
and Wonder Woman...

18:34.405 --> 18:37.534
before their war destroys
what's left of the world.

18:38.910 --> 18:42.288
- We can do it.
- That's exactly what Captain Atom said...

18:42.497 --> 18:44.749
before he flew over there and vanished.

18:44.958 --> 18:48.378
He went in without a plan or backup.
That's where you come in.

18:48.586 --> 18:52.090
If we want to win this thing, we need
the best tactician on the planet.

18:52.298 --> 18:54.217
You.

18:55.885 --> 18:57.846
You can't just turn your back on this.

18:58.054 --> 19:01.057
Not when we've got a chance to stop
this war and save the world.

19:01.266 --> 19:05.311
War's over, soldier.
You just don't know it yet.

19:05.520 --> 19:07.397
Everybody lost.

19:19.659 --> 19:24.205
- Can I help you, sir?
- Sir? Doris, it's me.

19:30.086 --> 19:33.590
No, I don't need help.
Everything's fine now.

19:33.798 --> 19:35.633
Mommy.

19:39.596 --> 19:42.056
- How is my little angel?
- Awesome.

19:42.265 --> 19:45.393
Daddy took me out to lunch
and we had chicken wings...

19:45.602 --> 19:50.440
and I told him about the invasion drill
we had at school today.

20:21.179 --> 20:24.474
Bruce? Alfred?

20:41.074 --> 20:43.534
What happened to you, Bruce?

20:44.661 --> 20:47.247
You were the James Bond
of superheroes.

20:47.956 --> 20:49.540
What turned you into the Unabomber?

20:54.837 --> 20:56.714
Who are you?

20:56.923 --> 21:02.095
I said who the hell are you?

21:04.180 --> 21:07.809
Bruce, wait. You have to remember.
It's me. It's Barry.

21:08.017 --> 21:10.061
Barry Allen. Bruce?

21:10.270 --> 21:11.646
- Bruce?
- Bruce.

21:11.854 --> 21:14.649
Bruce is dead. I watched him die.

21:14.857 --> 21:16.401
My God.

21:16.609 --> 21:19.445
He's the one who died
that night in the alley.

21:19.654 --> 21:24.117
Bruce died and you lived.
You're his father.

21:24.951 --> 21:27.662
You're Thomas Wayne.

21:31.291 --> 21:33.376
Pilgrim to Mayflower, do you copy?

21:35.003 --> 21:38.172
Where the hell are you?
I'm at the rendezvous point.

21:38.381 --> 21:41.592
There's no sign of the package
or any other members of the resistance.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.720
And I'm up to my neck in Amazons.

22:10.413 --> 22:12.290
You're an American.

22:12.498 --> 22:15.084
But you're going to tell me
a little more about yourself.

22:15.293 --> 22:18.796
- Who are you?
- No.

22:19.005 --> 22:20.715
He's resisting the Lasso of Truth.

22:20.923 --> 22:23.134
How is that possible, Queen Diana?

22:23.343 --> 22:25.094
It's not.

22:28.973 --> 22:32.185
Who are you, and what are you doing
in New Themyscira?

22:34.729 --> 22:37.815
My name is Colonel Steve Trevor
of the United States Special Forces.

22:38.024 --> 22:41.569
- I'm here to retrieve Lois Lane.
- Who is Lois Lane?

22:41.778 --> 22:44.072
Lois Lane is a Pulitzer Prize
winning journalist...

22:44.280 --> 22:46.991
who's been embedded
in New Themyscira for three months...

22:47.200 --> 22:49.035
gathering intel
on your Amazons for Cyborg.

22:49.243 --> 22:52.538
She's... She's also one of the most
beautiful women I've ever met.

22:52.747 --> 22:53.790
Until now, you mean.

22:55.249 --> 22:56.709
Our information was correct.

22:56.918 --> 22:59.038
Cyborg is amassing the outside
world's super-humans...

22:59.170 --> 23:01.089
in an attempt
to interfere with our war.

23:01.297 --> 23:05.093
He will fail.
Now, find me this Lois Lane.

23:05.301 --> 23:09.972
Yes, my queen.
May I deal with the prisoner for you?

23:10.181 --> 23:11.224
No.

23:11.432 --> 23:13.976
The queen of the Amazons
is a servant to her people.

23:19.607 --> 23:21.234
Nothing is beneath her.

23:35.456 --> 23:37.917
I told you, everything changed.

23:38.584 --> 23:41.087
You have nine more fingers.

23:41.295 --> 23:44.132
I suggest you tell me
how you found out about me.

23:45.049 --> 23:48.886
In my world,
I'm a hero named the Flash.

23:49.095 --> 23:51.139
Bruce took me here, showed me...

23:53.307 --> 23:54.851
I used to be a doctor.

23:55.685 --> 24:00.773
Mention my dead son again and I will
break out my surgical instruments.

24:08.698 --> 24:12.743
My ring. Let me show you
that I'm telling the truth.

24:12.952 --> 24:15.288
My uniform is in that ring.

24:21.085 --> 24:22.211
I'll humor you.

24:27.383 --> 24:29.051
See? I told...

24:31.512 --> 24:32.889
Not what you were expecting?

24:34.474 --> 24:37.685
- No. Thawne.
- Who?

24:37.894 --> 24:39.770
The man this uniform belongs to.

24:39.979 --> 24:43.357
My opposite, the Reverse-Flash.
Eobard Thawne.

24:43.566 --> 24:47.028
- What kind of name is Eobard?
- The 25th-century kind.

24:47.236 --> 24:50.698
He replicated the accident that allowed me
to tap into the Speed Force...

24:50.907 --> 24:52.950
became a criminal,
Professor Zoom.

24:53.159 --> 24:54.285
Speed Force?

24:54.494 --> 24:59.081
The Speed Force allows both of us to bend
the laws of physics using super speed.

24:59.290 --> 25:01.334
He can travel through time.

25:02.877 --> 25:05.463
You're suggesting that he changed
something in the past...

25:05.671 --> 25:08.299
That changed everything. It's crazy.

25:08.508 --> 25:11.219
My mom's alive. You're Batman.

25:11.427 --> 25:15.264
And Diana and Arthur
are about to start World War Ill.

25:15.681 --> 25:17.767
But why give me this?

25:20.937 --> 25:22.230
He hates you.

25:22.438 --> 25:24.982
So much he'll destroy everything
to kill you.

25:25.191 --> 25:28.778
But his psychosis requires
that you know he's responsible.

25:28.986 --> 25:31.614
Could anyone, even Thawne,
be that deranged?

25:35.743 --> 25:39.372
You'd be amazed the monsters
this world can create.

25:40.248 --> 25:41.666
We have to stop this, Dr. Wayne.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.709
Catch Thawne,
find out what he changed...

25:43.918 --> 25:46.420
and change it back before Aquaman
and Wonder Woman...

25:46.629 --> 25:48.464
kill everyone on the planet.

25:48.673 --> 25:52.593
Not saying I believe you,
but in your reality...

25:52.802 --> 25:55.763
- ...is my son...?
- Bruce is alive.

25:55.972 --> 25:57.890
He's Batman.

25:59.976 --> 26:03.229
If I were to help you,
what exactly would we need?

26:03.437 --> 26:07.108
Just what's over there
and unbelievably bad weather.

26:09.694 --> 26:11.571
Welcome to Gotham.

26:19.996 --> 26:22.123
I thought you were supposed to be smart.

26:22.331 --> 26:25.751
I am smart, captain. Very smart.

26:25.960 --> 26:28.546
Unfortunately,
having the greatest intellect on earth...

26:28.754 --> 26:30.965
doesn't always help one
do the impossible.

26:31.173 --> 26:33.634
You better be able to pinpoint
that son of a bitch.

26:33.843 --> 26:36.554
Aquaman's doomsday device
should be easy for me to find...

26:36.762 --> 26:38.806
simply by locating the power source.

26:39.015 --> 26:41.309
A weapon capable
of wiping out continents...

26:41.517 --> 26:43.936
would require an astonishing
amount of energy.

26:44.145 --> 26:45.938
Based on my analysis
of the shockwave...

26:46.147 --> 26:48.733
our course should take us
right over the origin point.

26:48.941 --> 26:51.319
And there's nothing. Not a blip.

26:51.527 --> 26:53.988
I'm taking a big risk
coming this close to his waters.

26:54.196 --> 26:57.325
- How close are we?
- See for yourself.

27:07.043 --> 27:08.669
That's a lot of death.

27:08.878 --> 27:10.004
Even for me.

27:10.212 --> 27:13.424
I suggest if you want to prevent further
tragedies of this magnitude...

27:37.573 --> 27:38.783
Battle stations!

27:38.991 --> 27:41.243
A bit too late for that, I think.

29:39.528 --> 29:41.989
Surface-dwellers, my lord.
Not Amazons.

29:42.198 --> 29:44.366
Meddlers, Orrn. They're in my way.

29:48.204 --> 29:51.707
Well, at least I know I was right.

29:53.083 --> 29:55.294
No survivors.

30:00.800 --> 30:03.093
This is crazy. You ought to be in Arkham.

30:03.302 --> 30:06.764
Maybe so, but I need to recreate
the conditions of the accident...

30:06.972 --> 30:09.475
that turned me into the Flash.
Strap me in.

30:15.856 --> 30:20.027
You know, they say that lightning
doesn't strike the same place twice.

30:20.236 --> 30:22.196
They say a lot of things.

30:22.404 --> 30:24.490
Now why don't we pull the switch
and find out?

30:41.090 --> 30:42.258
Come on.

30:51.433 --> 30:54.270
Come on, I'm here.

31:00.776 --> 31:02.778
I'm right here!

31:28.929 --> 31:30.097
Oh, my God.

31:41.275 --> 31:43.903
<i>I wish you had better news for me, Cyborg.</i>

31:44.111 --> 31:48.574
<i>This cloud of war grows ever darker,
and I fear we've run out of options.</i>

31:51.660 --> 31:53.787
I just need a little more time,
Mr. President.

31:53.996 --> 31:58.208
<i>Victor, there is no more time.
Lex Luthor is dead.</i>

31:58.417 --> 31:59.710
<i>His mission failed.</i>

31:59.919 --> 32:03.297
<i>But at least we know the estimated
location of Aquaman's WMD.</i>

32:03.505 --> 32:06.300
Sir, let my team take
out the Atlantean device.

32:06.508 --> 32:10.971
<i>Cyborg, you did your best recruiting
meta-humans to help us end this conflict...</i>

32:11.180 --> 32:15.392
<i>but our top analysts say without
the Batman, you have no team.</i>

32:15.601 --> 32:17.811
<i>It's time to send in
the real heroes, son.</i>

32:18.020 --> 32:19.313
The military?

32:19.521 --> 32:22.816
The Atlantean tech will see them coming
from half a world away.

32:23.025 --> 32:24.652
<i>Let our boys worry about that.</i>

32:24.860 --> 32:27.696
<i>Thank you for everything
you've done for this country, Victor.</i>

32:27.905 --> 32:31.617
<i>But as of now, you're relieved of duty.</i>

34:27.815 --> 34:30.152
War, war, war!

34:44.248 --> 34:45.918
No.

35:37.177 --> 35:38.220
No!

35:44.726 --> 35:47.187
Lie down.
You have third-degree burns.

35:47.396 --> 35:48.564
You're lucky to be alive.

35:52.734 --> 35:56.321
Somehow I remember things
from this timeline.

35:56.530 --> 35:59.366
How Aquaman destroyed
most of Europe.

35:59.575 --> 36:01.660
Maybe that lightning jogged
your memory.

36:01.869 --> 36:04.246
But I can remember my world as well.

36:04.454 --> 36:07.958
A world where Aquaman would die
before harming innocent people.

36:08.167 --> 36:13.881
My memories are changing, realigning
with this new history Thawne's created.

36:14.089 --> 36:16.884
Soon I'll forget my timeline
and everyone in it.

36:17.092 --> 36:19.887
My wife, your son.

36:20.095 --> 36:23.682
- We're getting that world back.
- How?

36:26.768 --> 36:28.896
We try again.

36:31.440 --> 36:33.066
Try again.

36:33.275 --> 36:35.736
But, sire, the device is too dangerous.

36:35.944 --> 36:39.406
Our attack on New Themyscira
destroyed an entire continent...

36:39.615 --> 36:42.326
but still left the Amazon's
new homeland untouched.

36:42.534 --> 36:48.624
More unholy magic from those witches.
Next time we will level their island.

36:52.085 --> 36:53.337
Please, my emperor.

36:53.545 --> 36:55.672
We tried to use only a fraction
of the power...

36:55.881 --> 36:57.674
and now it is even less stable.

36:57.883 --> 37:01.220
I fear we could sweep clean the ocean floor
as well as the surface world.

37:01.428 --> 37:02.512
I see.

37:02.721 --> 37:04.932
Then we will take the witches' island
by force.

37:05.140 --> 37:07.476
Inch by bloody inch if necessary.

37:08.143 --> 37:10.270
They will pay
for what they did to Queen Mera.

37:13.232 --> 37:16.318
I told you never to speak her name.

37:16.526 --> 37:18.195
Yes, my liege.

37:18.403 --> 37:20.697
Prepare the armadas
for surface invasion.

37:20.906 --> 37:23.575
The Amazons' judgment is at hand.

37:34.544 --> 37:39.800
Because of you, I'll be responsible
for the deaths of millions.

37:52.604 --> 37:56.149
The odds against recreating exact
variables in the original accident are...

37:56.358 --> 37:59.945
Then just try to douse the flames
a little faster this time, okay?

38:53.707 --> 38:54.916
Told you I was fast.

39:01.548 --> 39:03.717
<i>This is Lois</i> Lane <i>of The Daily Planet.</i>

39:03.925 --> 39:06.970
My battery is about to die
and I will likely be joining it soon.

39:21.568 --> 39:26.073
Earlier today the Amazons captured
some of Aquaman's advance scouts.

39:26.281 --> 39:30.869
Wonder Woman's lasso made them
spill their guts, literally.

39:48.804 --> 39:51.765
Aquaman is leading his army through
the English Channel tomorrow.

39:51.973 --> 39:54.726
The Amazons are worried
that if he gets his secret weapon...

39:54.935 --> 39:57.229
past their shield,
they'll be vulnerable.

39:57.437 --> 39:58.917
They remain defiant in the face of...

40:12.911 --> 40:15.997
Final thoughts:
If there is an afterlife...

40:16.206 --> 40:18.667
a cushy anchor job
would not be out of line.

40:35.350 --> 40:38.353
Amazons, be ready for...

40:44.151 --> 40:46.987
Who are you? What are you?

40:50.991 --> 40:54.202
Don't worry, hot legs.
We're on your side.

40:55.203 --> 40:56.830
Yes, fear not, good lady.

40:57.038 --> 40:59.833
Though our appearance
is somewhat frightful, we're...

41:00.041 --> 41:01.418
The resistance, I know.

41:01.626 --> 41:05.172
Grifter, Godiva, Mrs. Hyde,
Canterbury Cricket.

41:09.885 --> 41:12.262
And some kind of demon from hell.

41:12.471 --> 41:18.143
To my share of chaos I make my claim
and Etrigan is my name.

41:18.351 --> 41:21.062
Oh, great, he rhymes.
That's not going to get old fast.

41:21.271 --> 41:24.774
Lois Lane's famous mouth.

41:24.983 --> 41:27.527
I can't believe you didn't get
an arrow shot through it.

41:27.736 --> 41:31.531
I would have, if it weren't for whichever
one of you can run at super-speed.

41:31.740 --> 41:33.366
So who do I thank?

41:33.575 --> 41:37.454
I don't know what you think just happened,
but there ain't no speedster on this team.

41:37.662 --> 41:40.123
Now, let's get out of here
while we still can.

41:46.087 --> 41:48.924
Never seen anything like it.

41:49.174 --> 41:52.052
Your burns are healing.
You should be dead.

41:52.260 --> 41:54.221
Your bedside manner sucks.

41:54.429 --> 41:57.849
If I didn't have the Speed Force
helping me heal, I'd find another doctor.

41:58.725 --> 41:59.935
I run a casino.

42:00.143 --> 42:02.187
Haven't been a doctor in 20 years.

42:02.395 --> 42:06.399
Here. You need a suit,
and I'm not about to loan you one of mine.

42:06.608 --> 42:09.444
What? It's friction-proof, isn't it?

42:18.328 --> 42:20.914
I had to at least make some
last-minute alterations.

42:21.122 --> 42:23.583
Very snazzy.
I suggest you take it for a test run...

42:23.792 --> 42:26.044
and make sure you can break
that time barrier.

42:26.253 --> 42:27.712
Once we know that...

42:33.176 --> 42:36.471
So I'm finally on the other end
of that trick.

42:54.322 --> 42:56.283
Come on, Barry. Faster.

42:58.994 --> 43:00.870
Faster.

43:24.936 --> 43:27.897
If you would just slip these
over your shoes, Mr. Jordan.

43:28.106 --> 43:30.734
Sure. Cleaning bill here must be murder.

43:30.942 --> 43:32.444
What's your name?

43:32.652 --> 43:36.281
I'm afraid we don't have time
for introductions, Captain Jordan.

43:36.489 --> 43:40.368
- Pity.
- I was warned about you.

43:40.577 --> 43:43.580
But the president wanted the best pilot,
so you're stuck with me.

43:43.788 --> 43:46.207
Why don't you show me
what you've got hidden away here...

43:46.416 --> 43:48.460
and I'll show you what
I can do with it?

43:50.712 --> 43:52.756
Holy crap.

43:52.964 --> 43:54.799
I was hoping this would shut you up.

43:55.008 --> 43:57.677
Crashed in the California desert
eight years ago.

43:57.886 --> 44:00.764
Our scientists have been
piecing it back together since then.

44:00.972 --> 44:06.686
Its handling capabilities are,
well, beyond anything that we have.

44:06.895 --> 44:10.065
May be a little tricky to get the hang of.

44:12.233 --> 44:14.527
And who's this handsome devil?

44:14.736 --> 44:16.196
- Pilot.
- Died on impact?

44:16.404 --> 44:18.239
Kicked off just as my men found him.

44:18.448 --> 44:20.492
Report said he muttered
something in English:

44:20.700 --> 44:22.410
"Beware my power."

44:22.619 --> 44:26.706
Then a glowing ring floated off his finger
and shot into space.

44:26.915 --> 44:28.667
His ring flew away?

44:28.875 --> 44:31.252
You're about to fly
a dead alien's spaceship...

44:31.461 --> 44:33.922
and that's the part
you have trouble believing?

44:34.130 --> 44:35.173
Touché.

44:35.382 --> 44:39.302
You understand, Jordan,
this mission is no cake walk. In fact...

44:39.511 --> 44:41.680
In fact, in all likelihood,
it's a one-way trip.

44:41.888 --> 44:45.684
And if I'm afraid, if I want to back out,
no hard feelings, something like that?

44:45.892 --> 44:47.477
Something like that.

44:47.686 --> 44:50.563
General Lane, all my life,
I felt like something...

44:50.772 --> 44:52.982
really special was waiting for me.

44:53.191 --> 44:54.984
Something nobody else
on earth could do.

44:55.193 --> 44:59.698
I think I just found it.
So the last thing I am is afraid.

45:01.908 --> 45:05.245
This thing is unbelievably slow,
just like me.

45:05.453 --> 45:07.288
You move pretty fast to my eyes.

45:07.497 --> 45:10.875
Not fast enough to break the time barrier,
which I need to do.

45:11.084 --> 45:15.171
The only thing I can figure is that another
speedster is co-opting the Speed Force...

45:15.380 --> 45:18.091
keeping me from accessing
enough energy to time-travel.

45:18.299 --> 45:23.096
But there is no other speedster.
Not in the real world. My world.

45:23.304 --> 45:24.889
So it has to be Zoom.

45:25.098 --> 45:27.142
He's the only one
who could've done this.

45:27.350 --> 45:30.103
He's deliberately preventing me
from changing things back.

45:30.311 --> 45:31.771
Then nothing can be done.

45:31.980 --> 45:35.608
Even if we knew the trigger point, there's
no one to go back in time and fix it.

45:35.817 --> 45:37.736
Superman could.

45:37.944 --> 45:42.282
I already told you, there's no meta-human
that fits that description in this reality.

45:42.490 --> 45:43.908
I'm not so sure.

45:44.117 --> 45:48.580
In my new memories of this timeline,
I saw something.

45:48.788 --> 45:52.208
- A meteor. It hit a city.
- Metropolis.

45:52.417 --> 45:53.543
Thirty years ago.

45:53.752 --> 45:58.089
The same day Superman's rocket
crashed in my reality.

46:03.344 --> 46:05.388
So this never happened in your world?

46:05.597 --> 46:07.974
- It must be a paradise.
- It's not.

46:08.183 --> 46:09.434
But at least there was hope.

46:09.642 --> 46:12.061
What makes you think
your space baby survived?

46:12.270 --> 46:13.354
He's a tough cookie.

46:13.563 --> 46:17.150
- Where's your contact?
- Don't worry. He's always on time.

46:21.362 --> 46:23.406
I have to admit, I didn't expect your call.

46:23.615 --> 46:24.783
Cyborg?

46:27.118 --> 46:30.997
- Vic? You look different.
- Have we met?

46:31.206 --> 46:33.833
No, he's new. Super-speed.
Goes by the Flash.

46:34.042 --> 46:36.294
You still need a strategist
for your little army?

46:36.503 --> 46:38.004
Someone to put together a team...

46:38.213 --> 46:40.298
to shut down Aquaman
and Wonder Woman?

46:40.507 --> 46:43.343
- L... Yes.
- I'll do it.

46:43.551 --> 46:47.347
But my way, and I pick the team.
Starting with the Flash.

46:47.555 --> 46:50.683
Then we want to find the alien
who crash-landed here in Metropolis.

46:50.892 --> 46:52.769
Alien? What are you talking about?

46:52.977 --> 46:54.103
The meteor.

46:54.312 --> 46:57.023
It's not what your pals
at the Pentagon said it was.

46:58.691 --> 47:02.362
Classified information.
We need it and you can get it.

47:09.911 --> 47:12.330
Why aren't you telling him
about me and the timeline?

47:12.539 --> 47:15.375
- I'm not lying.
- You're misleading him.

47:15.583 --> 47:17.877
He has a right to know
what our real plan is.

47:18.086 --> 47:20.755
Don't preach to me.
I got enough misplaced morality...

47:20.964 --> 47:23.842
to handle with the big metal
Boy Scout on our hands.

47:24.050 --> 47:26.344
He wants to stop the war.
So do we.

47:26.553 --> 47:27.846
That's all he needs to know.

47:28.930 --> 47:31.766
There's something there,
but it's above even my clearance.

47:33.726 --> 47:36.229
I don't hack into government systems,
Batman.

47:36.437 --> 47:37.689
You do now.

47:37.897 --> 47:40.233
If you want me
on your little suicide squad.

48:08.261 --> 48:10.680
I'm cycling the motion sensors
and security cameras...

48:10.889 --> 48:12.849
but the loop won't go unnoticed
for long.

48:13.057 --> 48:14.726
Early morning skeleton crew.

48:14.934 --> 48:16.978
Well, do your thing.

48:33.995 --> 48:37.624
I'm trusting
that this is absolutely necessary.

48:37.832 --> 48:40.251
That's why we're here.

48:40.960 --> 48:43.338
Listen, I don't know
what changed your mind or why...

48:43.546 --> 48:47.300
but with you on board,
we can save the world from this war.

48:47.508 --> 48:48.676
Thank you.

48:48.885 --> 48:50.803
Focus on the mission at hand, Stone.

49:49.862 --> 49:50.989
Sir, are you okay?

49:54.075 --> 49:55.410
Is that Clark?

49:55.618 --> 49:57.829
This is the most powerful being
on the planet?

49:58.037 --> 50:00.206
Help me.

50:00.415 --> 50:04.210
Easy there, friend.
Everything's going to be fine now.

50:04.419 --> 50:07.547
- Fﬂend?
- That's right.

50:07.755 --> 50:11.384
Cyborg here is your friend.
I'm your friend too.

50:19.684 --> 50:21.310
This must be some kind of mistake.

50:21.519 --> 50:24.564
- A rogue division of the government...
- Keep telling yourself that.

50:24.772 --> 50:27.567
We should have left him where he was.
He'd be safer.

50:27.775 --> 50:29.652
He needs the sun.

50:29.861 --> 50:33.197
Don't know if you can understand me,
but what happened to you was wrong.

50:33.406 --> 50:35.700
- Most humans aren't like them.
- They're worse.

50:35.908 --> 50:37.618
No. People are good.

50:37.827 --> 50:40.747
In fact, some of them risk their lives
for the greater good.

50:40.955 --> 50:43.750
- They're called heroes.
- Heroes?

50:43.958 --> 50:47.003
Don't worry, friend.
Everything is going to be okay.

50:47.211 --> 50:48.796
I thought heroes never lied.

50:55.887 --> 50:59.474
Cyborg, stand down!
You have exceeded your authority.

50:59.682 --> 51:02.935
Return the stolen government property
or face immediate fire.

51:03.144 --> 51:06.606
You don't understand.
They were using this man as a lab rat.

51:06.814 --> 51:08.649
I don't think they care, Vic.

51:10.401 --> 51:13.780
So beautiful.

51:14.822 --> 51:17.366
I have orders from the president
of the United States.

51:17.575 --> 51:20.578
- Maybe I can end this peacefully.
- Yeah, maybe.

51:22.914 --> 51:24.624
No!

52:05.873 --> 52:07.500
Ffiends.

52:22.056 --> 52:24.976
Superman, close your eyes!

53:01.554 --> 53:03.639
- What's wrong with him?
- He's having a seizure.

53:03.848 --> 53:07.059
Memories collapsing in on each other.
We gotta get him out of here.

53:07.268 --> 53:11.439
Fight it, Allen. Don't forget my son.

53:16.569 --> 53:17.653
Hell, yeah!

53:17.862 --> 53:19.739
Highball, <i>this</i> is Papa Bear.

53:19.947 --> 53:22.158
<i>- Cut the chatter.
- Oh, did</i> I <i>say that out</i> loud?

53:22.366 --> 53:23.409
I didn't know.

53:23.618 --> 53:25.369
<i>You're only 1000 miles from drop zone.</i>

53:25.578 --> 53:27.747
<i>- Commence radio silence.
- Happily.</i>

53:27.955 --> 53:30.291
<i>One last thing, Jordan.
On behalf of all humanity...</i>

53:31.751 --> 53:34.086
Shut your hole already.
You're ruining this for me.

53:36.422 --> 53:39.717
There you are, baby.
Hold still for Highball.

53:44.722 --> 53:47.767
Beware my power, asshole.

54:08.120 --> 54:10.456
Continue invasion preparations.

54:15.962 --> 54:18.130
- Who the hell is this?
- He's with us.

54:18.339 --> 54:20.967
Now shut up. What's the story?

54:21.175 --> 54:24.262
Some kind of failed kamikaze attack
on Aquaman's weapon.

54:24.470 --> 54:28.307
- The pilot was Hal Jordan.
- Hal's dead?

54:28.516 --> 54:29.684
That's not all.

54:29.892 --> 54:32.645
The president sent a coalition fleet
to New Themyscira.

54:32.853 --> 54:34.522
The Amazons decimated it.

54:34.730 --> 54:36.774
Troops are being ordered
to Washington D.C...

54:36.983 --> 54:39.318
to protect the president
and members of Congress.

54:39.527 --> 54:42.863
Yeah, as our fearless leaders
make a mad dash for the bunkers.

54:43.072 --> 54:44.156
What does it mean?

54:44.365 --> 54:49.495
It means the final battle between Atlantis
and the Amazons has begun.

54:49.704 --> 54:51.789
But we haven't even started yet.

54:51.998 --> 54:53.499
There's nothing we can do now.

54:53.708 --> 54:56.252
Enjoy the things you love
with the time we have left.

54:56.460 --> 54:58.796
There's bound to be looting
in Gotham by now.

54:59.630 --> 55:00.923
I don't want to miss that.

55:01.132 --> 55:03.592
You're just gonna give up
and wait for the inevitable?

55:03.801 --> 55:05.594
Is that what your heroes do here?

55:05.803 --> 55:08.097
Look, you guys may not know me.

55:08.306 --> 55:11.851
But all of us have powers,
skills and abilities.

55:12.059 --> 55:14.687
Where I come from,
heroes use those powers...

55:14.895 --> 55:18.816
to fight to make the world a better
place, whether it's their world or not.

55:19.025 --> 55:22.361
But Superman...
You said he was our last, best hope.

55:22.570 --> 55:25.698
We're alive, Vic.
And where there's life, there's hope.

55:25.906 --> 55:26.949
We'll go to London...

55:27.158 --> 55:30.036
fight both sides
and save the world in the process.

55:30.911 --> 55:34.165
Okay. Then we go. Now.

55:34.373 --> 55:37.209
I'll signal the others.
Maybe they can meet us there.

55:38.044 --> 55:39.503
Bruce would have come.

55:40.921 --> 55:42.923
What the hell. Let's do this.

55:43.507 --> 55:45.384
Is the Batplane big enough
for all of us?

55:45.593 --> 55:47.845
The what?

55:53.642 --> 55:56.687
Bruce's Batplane was a little more stoic.

55:56.896 --> 55:59.065
Your Batman
didn't have to ferry high rollers...

55:59.273 --> 56:01.400
with deep pockets
in and out of his casino.

56:01.609 --> 56:04.362
So he wouldn't need
a fully stocked bar aboard.

56:04.570 --> 56:07.239
Everything is top shelf.
Help yourself.

56:07.448 --> 56:09.492
I don't drink.

56:09.700 --> 56:12.036
Shocking.

56:12.244 --> 56:14.705
I'm glad I could persuade you
to come along.

56:14.914 --> 56:15.998
You didn't.

56:16.207 --> 56:20.544
Ever since I told Cyborg I'd help, I've been
scanning for intel coming out of Europe.

56:20.753 --> 56:22.713
During your little Braveheart speech...

56:22.922 --> 56:26.342
I heard an intercepted message
you may find interesting.

56:26.550 --> 56:27.760
What?

56:27.968 --> 56:30.930
Lois Lane was an embedded
reporter turned resistance fighter.

56:31.138 --> 56:33.099
She saw something in New Themyscira.

56:33.307 --> 56:35.893
A super being who could move
in the blink of an eye.

56:36.102 --> 56:37.144
Thawne.

56:37.353 --> 56:40.564
If it was him, why let Lane live,
much less help her?

56:40.773 --> 56:44.026
- And if he's as fast as you...
- Why let himself be seen?

56:44.235 --> 56:46.237
Incoming!

56:57.790 --> 57:01.377
Sire, the aircraft has been intercepted
and nullified.

57:01.585 --> 57:03.629
Would that all our shots be so lucky.

57:03.838 --> 57:05.673
We have more than luck, Orm.

58:04.607 --> 58:06.859
Death to the under-dwellers!

58:08.319 --> 58:10.362
Kill them. Kill them all.

58:24.919 --> 58:28.380
Behold man's final mad disgrace.

58:28.589 --> 58:32.176
He chops his nose to spite his face.

58:41.810 --> 58:43.479
You've got to put an end to this.

58:43.687 --> 58:46.482
You're going to destroy the only world
we've got.

58:46.690 --> 58:49.401
You won't have it much longer,
surface-dweller.

58:59.078 --> 59:02.414
Take down
as many on both sides as you can.

59:02.623 --> 59:05.125
Maybe we can kill enough of them
to call off this war.

59:34.154 --> 59:35.948
Fight your way to the leaders.

59:36.156 --> 59:39.827
Once we have Aquaman
and Wonder Woman, this war is over.

01:00:11.984 --> 01:00:13.777
You murdered my wife, Diana.

01:00:13.986 --> 01:00:17.323
She tried to assassinate me, Arthur.
I was protecting myself.

01:00:17.531 --> 01:00:19.658
Yet you wear her helmet like a trophy.

01:00:19.867 --> 01:00:21.160
No. A warning.

01:00:32.713 --> 01:00:34.506
I can't believe I ever loved you.

01:00:34.715 --> 01:00:36.008
You never did.

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:42.723
Now!

01:00:53.901 --> 01:00:55.736
Shazam!

01:00:59.406 --> 01:01:00.824
Captain Thunder.

01:01:01.033 --> 01:01:06.246
I'm happy to see that a real man is here
to watch the end of man's world.

01:02:10.978 --> 01:02:12.396
Fall, damn it, fall!

01:02:25.659 --> 01:02:27.327
Sweet.

01:02:37.796 --> 01:02:39.840
I like your style, Batman.

01:02:40.841 --> 01:02:44.011
A pity we never teamed up
when the world still existed.

01:02:44.219 --> 01:02:46.722
Batman and Grifter, the boy idiot.

01:02:46.930 --> 01:02:48.724
Take your team up the right flank and...

01:03:03.864 --> 01:03:06.825
Don't worry, Batman.
I'll stop the blood flow.

01:03:07.034 --> 01:03:08.577
You'll be as good as new.

01:03:08.786 --> 01:03:11.163
Don't be stupid, Allen.

01:03:11.371 --> 01:03:16.502
I may not be a very good doctor, but
even I know a dead man when I see one.

01:03:21.757 --> 01:03:25.093
- They're gonna die.
- We're dead already.

01:03:25.302 --> 01:03:27.679
Find the speedster.

01:03:27.888 --> 01:03:29.306
Flush him out.

01:03:29.515 --> 01:03:32.017
Change all this.

01:03:32.226 --> 01:03:33.352
No.

01:03:34.019 --> 01:03:36.396
I won't stand by while people are...

01:03:43.445 --> 01:03:44.530
Hello, Barry.

01:03:44.738 --> 01:03:46.406
Thawne.

01:03:47.866 --> 01:03:51.328
- I love what you've done with the place.
- This is all your fault.

01:04:12.224 --> 01:04:13.892
This has worked out so well.

01:04:14.101 --> 01:04:16.270
That's why I let Lois Lane see me,
you know.

01:04:16.478 --> 01:04:17.938
I knew it would bring you.

01:04:20.607 --> 01:04:25.237
Not that you wouldn't have ended up here
anyway, you hero, you.

01:05:36.266 --> 01:05:38.393
What did you do to the world?

01:05:38.602 --> 01:05:40.228
Oh, Barry.

01:05:40.437 --> 01:05:42.648
That's the beauty of all this.

01:05:42.856 --> 01:05:44.816
I didn't do any of it.

01:05:47.152 --> 01:05:48.820
You did.

01:05:51.949 --> 01:05:53.158
Think, Barry.

01:05:53.367 --> 01:05:57.204
Isn't there some little thing, some little
good deed you might have done?

01:05:58.664 --> 01:06:02.209
- I saved someone.
- Yes.

01:06:03.043 --> 01:06:07.547
I saved her. I saved mom.

01:06:09.466 --> 01:06:12.761
- That's right.
- No. No.

01:06:12.970 --> 01:06:14.680
It wouldn't have changed all this.

01:06:14.888 --> 01:06:17.516
It wouldn't have changed
what happened before her murder.

01:06:17.724 --> 01:06:19.643
Bruce's parents, Clark's landing.

01:06:19.851 --> 01:06:22.896
Oh, but it did.

01:06:23.397 --> 01:06:26.108
Break the sound barrier
and there's a sonic boom.

01:06:26.316 --> 01:06:29.945
You broke the time barrier, Flash.
Time boom.

01:06:30.153 --> 01:06:33.573
Ripples of distortion radiated out
through that point of impact...

01:06:33.782 --> 01:06:36.493
shifting everything just a tiny bit.

01:06:36.702 --> 01:06:37.828
<i>But enough.</i>

01:06:38.036 --> 01:06:41.164
Enough for events to happen
slightly differently.

01:06:43.208 --> 01:06:45.711
I just wanted to save her.

01:06:45.919 --> 01:06:50.132
Her hero. How noble. Oh, wait.

01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:53.510
You didn't stop JFK
from getting assassinated...

01:06:53.719 --> 01:06:56.179
or made sure Hitler stayed
in art school.

01:06:56.388 --> 01:07:00.392
You saved your mommy.
You missed her.

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:05.647
And in a supreme act of selfishness,
shattered history like a rank amateur...

01:07:05.856 --> 01:07:09.651
turned the world into a living hell
moments away from destruction.

01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:11.445
And I'm the villain?

01:08:15.008 --> 01:08:16.051
No!

01:08:43.161 --> 01:08:44.912
This form is not your own.

01:08:45.122 --> 01:08:46.790
How is the enchantment broken?

01:08:46.997 --> 01:08:49.960
With a word.

01:08:50.167 --> 01:08:52.879
Speak the word.

01:08:55.674 --> 01:08:56.716
Shazam!

01:09:17.737 --> 01:09:22.367
The era of the land-dweller
is at an end, hero.

01:09:25.578 --> 01:09:29.040
Your metal skull
will decorate my great hall.

01:09:42.595 --> 01:09:44.055
Hero.

01:09:45.265 --> 01:09:47.184
Fﬂend.

01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:22.886
Submit.

01:10:24.804 --> 01:10:26.348
You are beaten.

01:10:26.556 --> 01:10:27.599
Surrender?

01:10:29.684 --> 01:10:31.102
Then what?

01:10:31.311 --> 01:10:34.606
You'll let the men of Atlantis
live as your slaves?

01:10:34.814 --> 01:10:35.941
The men? No.

01:10:36.149 --> 01:10:39.861
You are a pestilence the mother Gaia
has suffered for too long.

01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:45.617
- But perhaps Atlantis' daughters...
- There will be no glorious victor, Diana.

01:10:45.825 --> 01:10:46.993
No prize.

01:10:49.371 --> 01:10:52.666
What I do now,
I do for the good of all.

01:10:53.541 --> 01:10:55.085
As do I.

01:11:19.526 --> 01:11:22.445
- What are you doing?
- Getting you out of here, before he...

01:11:27.367 --> 01:11:29.286
It's too late.

01:11:40.672 --> 01:11:42.173
Good job, Barry.

01:11:42.382 --> 01:11:46.052
The world is about to end, thanks to you.

01:11:46.261 --> 01:11:48.680
I hope your mother has a good view of it.

01:11:48.888 --> 01:11:51.933
You can't let this happen, Thawne.
You'll die too.

01:11:52.142 --> 01:11:56.062
As you say in this era, totally worth it.

01:11:59.899 --> 01:12:04.404
As long as I can siphon off the Speed
Force, you can't escape this timeline.

01:12:04.612 --> 01:12:07.032
I'm afraid there just isn't enough
Speed Force to go around.

01:12:16.374 --> 01:12:17.917
There is now.

01:12:18.585 --> 01:12:19.627
You killed him.

01:12:19.836 --> 01:12:21.379
Not necessarily.

01:12:27.010 --> 01:12:29.596
Not if you go back in time and fix this.

01:12:35.977 --> 01:12:41.066
The only way to save the world
is to keep this world from ever happening.

01:12:41.274 --> 01:12:43.360
Take this.

01:12:44.652 --> 01:12:46.488
Run.

01:13:54.097 --> 01:13:55.640
Barry!

01:13:55.849 --> 01:13:57.600
Stop, you'll kill everyone!

01:14:12.866 --> 01:14:16.578
Barry! Stop! You have to stop!

01:14:16.786 --> 01:14:18.538
Who the hell?

01:14:19.372 --> 01:14:20.498
Get away.

01:14:44.397 --> 01:14:47.525
Mom, I'm so sorry.

01:15:04.209 --> 01:15:05.251
Barry.

01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:07.629
Look who's just joined
the land of the living.

01:15:07.837 --> 01:15:09.881
Gotta run, James.

01:15:11.758 --> 01:15:15.094
You don't finish the files by Friday,
you'll be stuck here all weekend.

01:15:15.637 --> 01:15:18.473
Well, it's not the end of the world.

01:15:24.938 --> 01:15:26.898
I think I finally got it, Mom.

01:15:27.106 --> 01:15:29.567
The things you were trying to teach me.

01:15:29.776 --> 01:15:33.071
- Barry?
- Iris?

01:15:42.914 --> 01:15:46.292
Well, that's my kind of hello.

01:15:46.501 --> 01:15:50.797
- Is everything all right?
- It is now, honey.

01:15:52.090 --> 01:15:54.217
It is now.

01:15:55.260 --> 01:15:58.263
Just to review,
you broke the chronal barrier...

01:15:58.471 --> 01:16:01.099
went back in time,
prevented your mother's murder...

01:16:01.307 --> 01:16:03.518
and completely changed
the Timestream.

01:16:03.726 --> 01:16:06.354
Nearly destroying
the entire world along the way.

01:16:06.563 --> 01:16:07.814
Yes.

01:16:08.022 --> 01:16:10.108
There's still something
I don't understand.

01:16:10.316 --> 01:16:11.776
I remember all of it.

01:16:11.985 --> 01:16:16.406
Not just what happened after
I woke up there, but my whole other life.

01:16:16.614 --> 01:16:19.492
I remember every birthday cake
my mother ever baked me.

01:16:19.701 --> 01:16:22.245
My room, everything.

01:16:22.453 --> 01:16:25.498
Perhaps some kind of temporal
after-effect?

01:16:26.332 --> 01:16:29.711
Or perhaps it was a gift.

01:16:34.132 --> 01:16:36.676
Yes. A gift.

01:16:38.511 --> 01:16:40.680
This is my father's handwriting.

01:17:00.658 --> 01:17:03.494
You're one hell of a messenger.

01:17:04.037 --> 01:17:05.371
Thank you.
