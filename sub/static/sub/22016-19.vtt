WEBVTT

00:04.131 --> 00:06.506
Not again.
I just came from an intervention.

00:06.575 --> 00:08.469
Oh, no, no, Nicole,
this is a staff meeting.

00:08.538 --> 00:09.835
You asked us to be here.

00:09.921 --> 00:11.562
Oh.

00:11.687 --> 00:13.585
Here you go, Kato.

00:13.764 --> 00:16.226
Yes, I wanted to talk to you all

00:16.295 --> 00:18.632
about something very important.

00:18.709 --> 00:21.125
So, what plant has been revered

00:21.194 --> 00:23.661
for its healing properties
for millions of years?

00:23.730 --> 00:24.764
Aloe.

00:24.841 --> 00:28.285
'ello to you, too,
but let's stay focused.

00:29.957 --> 00:31.193
- Peppers.
- Peppers.

00:31.278 --> 00:33.238
Weird, we are so
in synch these days.

00:33.322 --> 00:35.060
I want to be in the pepper
business, people.

00:35.129 --> 00:36.785
And I need ideas now.

00:39.355 --> 00:41.995
I haven't come up with
a single product idea in weeks,

00:42.096 --> 00:44.003
so I'm on thin ice at NERP.

00:44.105 --> 00:46.152
And I don't mean
the low-calorie ice cubes

00:46.221 --> 00:47.706
we sell on our website.

00:48.050 --> 00:49.488
Well, my... my step-grandmother,

00:49.557 --> 00:52.394
she is from Colombia,
and she sells a salsa

00:52.464 --> 00:55.089
that is supposedly made
with these magical peppers.

00:55.158 --> 00:57.527
Peppers?
I was just talking about them.

00:57.596 --> 00:58.605
Yeah.

00:58.794 --> 01:00.120
When can I meet her?

01:00.324 --> 01:03.097
Sell my sauce business to NERP?

01:03.166 --> 01:04.604
I think you could get
a lot for it.

01:04.673 --> 01:05.809
When Nicole wants something,

01:05.877 --> 01:07.199
she just throws money at it.

01:07.268 --> 01:08.481
She bought her
next-door neighbor's house

01:08.517 --> 01:09.759
because she liked the mailbox.

01:09.889 --> 01:11.013
I don't know.

01:11.090 --> 01:12.995
I do.
Dump it.

01:13.113 --> 01:15.628
That thing is worth less
than a bachelor's degree.

01:15.738 --> 01:18.277
Please, Gloria.
I really need this.

01:18.394 --> 01:20.364
No one takes me seriously
at that office.

01:20.433 --> 01:22.074
I don't even have
my own cubicle.

01:22.214 --> 01:24.636
I share one, giant bean bag chair
with the interns.

01:24.755 --> 01:26.079
I want to help you,

01:26.171 --> 01:28.327
but...
something feels wrong.

01:28.396 --> 01:31.128
Just go to the meeting
and hear what the offer is.

01:31.715 --> 01:34.003
Okay, fine. I will go.
I will listen.

01:34.080 --> 01:35.730
But I am not selling.

01:37.791 --> 01:39.526
- What do you think?
- It's gonna be tough.

01:39.595 --> 01:42.464
She's got a lot of practice
not selling that sauce.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.074

01:57.800 --> 02:00.105
Whoa, what's up
with the blazer and the T-shirt?

02:00.261 --> 02:02.021
Thought you were going
to a college interview,

02:02.089 --> 02:03.808
not doing stand up in 1988.

02:03.877 --> 02:06.035
I'm starting to think
maybe college isn't for me.

02:06.105 --> 02:08.410
There's this guy at the club
who said I could be a model.

02:08.535 --> 02:10.301
He said he's gonna take me
out to the desert this week

02:10.370 --> 02:13.074
- and take some pictures.
- I'd put a pin in that.

02:13.187 --> 02:15.263
Of course you're going to college.
What are you talking about?

02:15.331 --> 02:16.408
I don't know.

02:16.500 --> 02:18.573
I wasn't very good at school
the first time around.

02:18.644 --> 02:19.903
- Maybe I'm just...
- Hey!

02:19.972 --> 02:22.183
Don't you dare
call yourself "an idiot".

02:22.330 --> 02:23.768
I wasn't going to.

02:24.112 --> 02:26.307
I was gonna say,
"Maybe I'm not ready."

02:26.376 --> 02:28.065
Honey, it's just nerves.

02:28.151 --> 02:29.777
Change is scary, but in the end,

02:29.846 --> 02:31.715
I promise,
it is all worth it.

02:31.784 --> 02:32.870
Your mother's right.

02:32.956 --> 02:34.893
You dig deep,
you make your best effort,

02:34.970 --> 02:36.824
- that's where you find the glory.
- Exactly.

02:36.893 --> 02:38.909
Like that time
I beat her in that race.

02:39.174 --> 02:42.260
Maybe 10 years ago,
Phil challenged me to a race.

02:42.456 --> 02:44.081
I don't believe it!

02:44.197 --> 02:45.685
Daddy wins!

02:45.848 --> 02:47.777
Do you believe in miracles?

02:47.854 --> 02:49.174
U.S.A.!

02:49.252 --> 02:51.556
He was feeling adrift
because the kids were back at school,

02:51.624 --> 02:53.495
so I let him beat me.

02:53.808 --> 02:56.002
He has not shut up
about it since.

02:56.095 --> 02:57.424
- Oh!
- Oh!

02:57.565 --> 03:00.338
Oh, my God,
Usain Bolt wins again!

03:00.407 --> 03:01.541
Can you even imagine

03:01.610 --> 03:02.730
- what that feels like?
- Oh,

03:02.799 --> 03:04.063
I don't have to, sweetheart.

03:04.132 --> 03:05.205
I lived it.

03:06.119 --> 03:08.708
All appeared lost,
but I turned on the afterburners...

03:08.777 --> 03:09.908
He's heard the story, Phil.

03:09.977 --> 03:12.169
And I pull off
one of the greatest upsets

03:12.238 --> 03:14.886
in the history of
husband-and-wife competition.

03:15.566 --> 03:18.988
Okay, I'll go to that college interview
and hear them out.

03:19.089 --> 03:20.519
I'm proud of you, buddy.

03:22.095 --> 03:23.674
I think what
you and I did right there

03:23.743 --> 03:24.816
was called "great parenting".

03:24.884 --> 03:27.089
Might be time
to retire that story.

03:27.824 --> 03:30.730
I am so sorry.
That was insensitive.

03:30.799 --> 03:32.404
I didn't realize
how much it must bother you

03:32.472 --> 03:33.870
to relive that loss.

03:33.939 --> 03:35.826
- Phil, I am just feeling...
- Hey, don't you dare call

03:35.894 --> 03:38.167
- yourself "a failure".
- I let you win.

03:38.789 --> 03:39.921
You what?

03:39.990 --> 03:42.486
Oh, I had you beat, easily.
I didn't even break a sweat.

03:42.642 --> 03:45.626
As a matter of fact,
I almost pulled a muscle holding back.

03:45.700 --> 03:49.156
But, I saw how much it meant to you,
and I let you win.

03:49.232 --> 03:51.869
Oh, wow, yeah.
No, that makes a lot of sense. I get it.

03:51.938 --> 03:54.418
Like the way all the other horses
wanted Secretariat to feel good.

03:54.486 --> 03:55.595
Now you're Secretariat?

03:55.681 --> 03:57.369
I don't know.
Was Secretariat

03:57.438 --> 03:58.487
married to a crazy person?

03:58.556 --> 04:01.885
Oh, God, Phil,
I 100% let you win.

04:01.975 --> 04:05.328
Then, you could 100%
beat me again.

04:05.397 --> 04:07.233
Oh, I could. Same course?

04:07.303 --> 04:08.344
I've only gotten stronger.

04:08.413 --> 04:09.999
How 'bout
we add a few challenges?

04:10.124 --> 04:12.225
- Monkey bars?
- Great! Rope climb.

04:12.294 --> 04:13.499
I love it. Tires.

04:13.568 --> 04:14.837
Why not? Noon?

04:14.906 --> 04:17.764
- Fine. I have a showing. I'll move it.
- Hope it's not too heavy.

04:20.209 --> 04:22.734
The release form
for this ride-along is...

04:22.803 --> 04:24.039
is shockingly thorough.

04:24.108 --> 04:25.742
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

04:25.811 --> 04:27.593
I can't bury another ride-along.

04:28.502 --> 04:30.593
I'm kind of the precinct cut up.

04:31.288 --> 04:33.616
Okay. Mitchell, it'll be fine.
They do these things all the time.

04:33.684 --> 04:36.295
Yeah, easy for you to say.
My entire head is a gang color.

04:36.364 --> 04:37.602
Okay, this is so exciting.

04:37.671 --> 04:40.176
You know, in my alternate life,
I'm a... I'm a cop.

04:40.245 --> 04:41.733
I-I thought that your alternate life

04:41.802 --> 04:43.764
was you teaching at-risk youth
to street dance.

04:43.844 --> 04:45.977
No, I teach them
to believe in themselves

04:46.046 --> 04:47.359
through street dance.

04:47.436 --> 04:49.194
Cam's always wanted
to go on a ride-along.

04:49.263 --> 04:50.899
So, I called in a favor

04:50.968 --> 04:53.522
to my law school friend Lucy
at the DA's office.

04:53.608 --> 04:55.487
Weird thing, they're understaffed.

04:55.564 --> 04:58.119
And she offered me a job
as a prosecutor.

04:58.374 --> 05:00.600
I just... I can't picture
myself with a badge.

05:00.764 --> 05:03.249
I mean, I already hate
how thick my wallet is.

05:03.342 --> 05:05.139
So, when do we roll?

05:05.462 --> 05:07.258
- You mean leave?
- Oh, copy that.

05:07.335 --> 05:09.079
You know, it's hard for me
not to use the lingo.

05:09.147 --> 05:12.288
Bit of a lawman myself,
acting high-school vice principal.

05:12.663 --> 05:14.372
Anyway, they call me "Arthritis"

05:14.441 --> 05:16.124
because I make life hard on seniors.

05:16.405 --> 05:17.442
They don't.

05:17.519 --> 05:18.898
But he did make a sign
for his desk,

05:18.966 --> 05:20.479
- didn't ya?
- Hey, hey.

05:20.556 --> 05:22.560
Do you think that perhaps
you're coming on a tad strong?

05:22.628 --> 05:26.275
No, I think Officer Stablitzky
appreciates me knowing the language.

05:26.360 --> 05:27.423
It's, like, when you go to Italy,

05:27.491 --> 05:28.858
you use "prego" every other word.
They love it.

05:28.926 --> 05:30.618
<i>Break-in in progress.
Cooper and Olympic.</i>

05:30.703 --> 05:32.563
- Wait. What was that?
- In progress?

05:32.632 --> 05:33.953
Should we wait 'til they're done?

05:34.022 --> 05:36.328
- 12-A-3 responding.
- <i>Copy that, 12-A-3.</i>

05:36.404 --> 05:37.673
Mitchell, why don't you ride shotgun?

05:37.741 --> 05:39.431
Oh, no, You know,
he doesn't do that well

05:39.500 --> 05:40.776
on Splash Mountain
in the front seat, so...

05:40.844 --> 05:42.858
- He'll be fine. Get in.
- Yes, sir. Okay.

05:42.927 --> 05:43.875
Okay, and then, you know, then,

05:43.944 --> 05:45.882
maybe I can front seat on
even crimes.

05:45.951 --> 05:48.164
- You know, to keep it fair.
- Probably not.

05:50.539 --> 05:52.576
You know, Phil,
it's not too late to back out.

05:52.666 --> 05:54.556
I am in the best shape of my life.

05:54.673 --> 05:56.138
After my last physical,

05:56.207 --> 05:58.474
the doctor posted my stress test
on his Instagram.

05:58.543 --> 06:00.781
Honey, I'm on the basketball court
four days a week.

06:00.850 --> 06:02.562
They call me "Phil Dunk-phy".

06:02.755 --> 06:05.133
Well, take a good look at this face
'cause it's the last time

06:05.201 --> 06:06.399
you're gonna see it for a while...

06:06.467 --> 06:08.498
- on your mark, get set, go!
- Hey!

06:10.990 --> 06:12.585
I immediately pulled that muscle

06:12.654 --> 06:13.922
that runs from
the top of your head

06:13.990 --> 06:15.608
down to the bottom of your feet.

06:15.707 --> 06:16.831
The truth is,

06:16.900 --> 06:19.490
between work and
not wanting to workout,

06:19.692 --> 06:21.569
I hadn't worked out that much.

06:21.795 --> 06:23.694
Welcome to the jungle, Claire.

06:23.842 --> 06:26.631
Monkey see,
monkey d... Ow!

06:26.764 --> 06:29.332
<i>My first thought was
that I had been shot in both shoulders.</i>

06:29.560 --> 06:31.584
Here's the thing...
while Claire works out,

06:31.672 --> 06:33.701
I do go to the basketball court,

06:33.850 --> 06:37.131
but, uh, for epic robot battles.

06:39.553 --> 06:42.371
Oh, Spin-a-tron cornered me again.

06:42.440 --> 06:45.421
Looks like you got me dead...
Possum-punch!

06:45.490 --> 06:48.350
Possum-punch! Possum-punch!

06:56.248 --> 06:57.727
Clouds look kind of ominous, huh?

06:57.804 --> 06:59.084
Kind of felt a raindrop.

06:59.269 --> 07:01.100
- Maybe we should reschedule...
- Okay.

07:01.693 --> 07:03.062
Sorry we missed that robbery.

07:03.131 --> 07:04.828
It would've been a fun way
to start the day.

07:04.896 --> 07:07.991
Yeah, hi. Have you guys considered
using the Waze app.

07:08.060 --> 07:09.265
I could fire it up

07:09.334 --> 07:10.664
and it'd be kind of,
like, your Goose.

07:10.732 --> 07:12.094
- Whoa, did you see that?
- See what?

07:12.162 --> 07:13.484
I'm blocked.
I can't see anything.

07:13.553 --> 07:15.460
That jerk just cut off that old lady.

07:15.529 --> 07:17.241
- Wanna mess with him?
- Mess with who?

07:17.310 --> 07:18.366
Is that allowed?

07:18.435 --> 07:20.279
What's he gonna do,
call the cops?

07:20.560 --> 07:21.662
Can you speak up a little bit?

07:21.730 --> 07:23.951
- I'm losing the thread.
- That's the siren.

07:24.072 --> 07:25.696
- Okay.
- Not yet.

07:25.867 --> 07:28.156
Not yet. Now!

07:28.233 --> 07:29.656
Oh! Oh, my God!

07:29.725 --> 07:31.563
He's freaked out. Oh, he's pulling over.

07:31.640 --> 07:34.318
- Put these on and glare at him.
- Okay, okay.

07:34.506 --> 07:36.935
That's right.
You know you were bad.

07:37.068 --> 07:39.326
Sit in your shame like a dog!

07:40.577 --> 07:41.671
You're a natural.

07:41.740 --> 07:43.491
Oh, my God, that was such a rush.

07:43.560 --> 07:45.859
I imagine that's what it feels like
to punch a guy or...

07:45.928 --> 07:47.685
or catch a ball while running.

07:47.756 --> 07:49.249
Oh, hey, Chatty-Cathys, heads up.

07:49.318 --> 07:51.132
- Possible 10-99 right over here.
- What?

07:51.201 --> 07:53.818
Couple low lifes over there
exchanging cash-money.

07:53.998 --> 07:55.757
That's because it's a newsstand.

07:55.826 --> 07:57.726
And I'm pretty sure a 1099
is a tax form.

07:57.795 --> 07:59.646
Oh, yeah, well,
what isn't a form these days?

07:59.715 --> 08:00.944
School board's got me
buried in paperwork.

08:01.012 --> 08:02.899
I gotta get three John Hancocks
just to take a leak.

08:02.967 --> 08:04.320
We're the same, see?

08:04.389 --> 08:06.406
Oh, if I can interrupt
for just one second.

08:06.475 --> 08:08.160
I've been typing
license plates numbers...

08:08.237 --> 08:09.858
as you said I could...

08:09.951 --> 08:11.730
and this guy in this dirty car here,

08:11.807 --> 08:13.866
he has a warrant
for unpaid child support.

08:13.943 --> 08:15.100
Good catch, Pritch.

08:15.177 --> 08:17.090
He gets a nickname now?!

08:17.951 --> 08:19.801
- Hmm, looking squirrely.
- Yeah.

08:21.107 --> 08:22.591
Yep, we got a runner!

08:22.660 --> 08:23.850
- Um...
- Stick by me.

08:23.893 --> 08:25.187
Oh, my God, is this happening?

08:25.264 --> 08:26.390
This is happening. Okay.

08:26.459 --> 08:28.350
Hey, guys? Guys?

08:28.514 --> 08:31.271
There's no handles back here!
I wanna come!

08:34.607 --> 08:36.270
Well, Luke, I read your essay.

08:36.498 --> 08:37.719
Took a lot of guts to admit

08:37.788 --> 08:39.725
you weren't ready for college
a year ago.

08:40.164 --> 08:42.428
I had a lot of growing up to do.

08:42.591 --> 08:44.975
So, I got a job, I paid my bills,

08:45.092 --> 08:46.918
and I read
the Wall Street Journal online

08:46.987 --> 08:48.717
until I used up my five free articles.

08:48.787 --> 08:51.029
Well, based on your credit score,

08:51.098 --> 08:53.670
we'd like to welcome you
to Sequoia Community College.

08:53.739 --> 08:55.248
Oh, thank you!

08:55.327 --> 08:56.718
And once your walk through

08:56.787 --> 08:59.405
one of our 15 TSA-approved
metal detectors,

08:59.474 --> 09:01.095
anything is possible.

09:01.164 --> 09:02.218
How hard is it?

09:02.287 --> 09:03.624
Well, most of our students report

09:03.693 --> 09:06.132
about 10 to 15 hours of
homework a week

09:06.201 --> 09:07.303
in addition to class time.

09:07.372 --> 09:08.667
That sounds like real college.

09:08.736 --> 09:11.766
This is a real college.
And it's a lot of hard work.

09:11.835 --> 09:13.428
But, you put in your two years here,

09:13.497 --> 09:16.592
then transfer to a real...
to a four-year college

09:16.661 --> 09:19.334
and you will land an entry-level job.

09:19.435 --> 09:20.602
Nothing too glamorous,

09:20.671 --> 09:23.092
but you pay your dues, climb the ladder.

09:23.295 --> 09:24.585
By the time you're 45,

09:24.654 --> 09:26.827
you're living in a three-bedroom house
with a picket fence!

09:26.895 --> 09:28.521
Wow!

09:29.172 --> 09:31.835
Three-bedroom house
with a picket fence?

09:32.396 --> 09:33.857
Already got one of those.

09:34.019 --> 09:35.981
Plus, free meals, laundry, and cable.

09:36.097 --> 09:37.785
I am living the dream.

09:37.987 --> 09:39.048
You know what I say?

09:39.146 --> 09:40.982
"Who needs college?"

09:42.391 --> 09:44.935
Great work out there.
I'm getting you a donut.

09:45.029 --> 09:46.585
- You earned it.
- Er, a donut.

09:46.662 --> 09:47.984
Isn't that a little on the nose?

09:48.053 --> 09:50.060
- And a lot on the belly.
- Ah, Blitz!

09:50.306 --> 09:51.497
Okay, guys, guys.

09:51.654 --> 09:53.048
The door handle situation
really

09:53.116 --> 09:54.682
- hasn't changed.
- Oh, sorry.

09:54.751 --> 09:56.376
- Yeah.
- I opened it.

09:56.445 --> 09:57.486
Sir? Okay.

09:57.555 --> 09:58.650
So humiliating.

09:58.719 --> 10:00.657
Officer Pierogi just
banishes me to the backseat

10:00.726 --> 10:02.503
like I'm just along for the ride.

10:02.611 --> 10:04.272
Well, it is called a "ride-along".
So...

10:04.341 --> 10:05.373
Mitchell!

10:05.442 --> 10:07.723
Oh, hey, Lucy, um...
Cam, this is Lucy.

10:07.792 --> 10:09.062
She's the one that
set all this up for us.

10:09.130 --> 10:10.609
- Oh, hi. Thank you so much.
- Hi.

10:10.678 --> 10:12.468
- Mitchell had a wonderful time.
- Oh, great.

10:12.537 --> 10:14.609
- So, does that mean the answer's "Yes"?
- What's the question?

10:14.677 --> 10:17.357
Oh, I've been trying for weeks
to get this guy to become prosecutor.

10:17.897 --> 10:21.088
Y... You mean, like, Angie Harmon on...
on "Law and Order"

10:21.165 --> 10:22.529
or Susan Dey on "L.A. Law"?

10:22.600 --> 10:23.968
Or a man who does that job.

10:24.037 --> 10:26.218
Okay, well, why didn't you
tell me about this?

10:27.542 --> 10:29.248
I'm going to give you guys a minute.

10:29.317 --> 10:31.531
But, um, Mitchell,
I really need to know by Monday.

10:31.600 --> 10:32.953
Otherwise, I have to move on
to someone else, okay?

10:33.021 --> 10:34.165
- Okay.
- It was nice to meet you.

10:34.233 --> 10:35.160
- Nice to meet you.
- Bye!

10:35.237 --> 10:36.247
Bye.

10:36.324 --> 10:38.820
Okay, I'm... I'm sorry
I... I didn't tell you about the job.

10:38.897 --> 10:40.335
It's... it's just a big change,

10:40.404 --> 10:42.187
and I wanted to make
this decision on my own.

10:42.256 --> 10:43.534
You know what, here's the good news.

10:43.602 --> 10:45.499
- You have a fantastic job offer...
- Mm-hmm.

10:45.576 --> 10:46.867
And if today taught us anything,

10:46.944 --> 10:48.665
it's that you have a passion
for this world.

10:48.733 --> 10:50.648
Well, actually,
if today taught me anything,

10:50.717 --> 10:52.977
it's that I definitely
do not want this job.

10:53.054 --> 10:55.006
I'm... I'm gonna go find Lucy.

10:57.815 --> 10:59.858
Oh, good. I'm late.

11:00.457 --> 11:03.365
I'm trying to free myself
of the calendar.

11:03.434 --> 11:05.381
I live by my circadian rhythms.

11:05.450 --> 11:06.608
So important!

11:06.677 --> 11:10.937
Nicole, this is my grandfather, Jay.

11:11.006 --> 11:11.904
How do you do?

11:11.973 --> 11:14.894
And this is the sauce maven
herself, my wife, Gloria.

11:15.046 --> 11:18.808
- Very nice to meet you.
- Oh, I love your accent.

11:19.169 --> 11:22.573
You know, I was up for the role
of El Chapo's mistress.

11:22.642 --> 11:24.855
Oh, I did not see that movie.

11:24.978 --> 11:26.390
What movie?

11:28.615 --> 11:30.386
And we appreciate you taking time

11:30.455 --> 11:33.203
from your busy schedule
here at NERP.

11:33.605 --> 11:35.105
It's a dynamite organization.

11:35.174 --> 11:37.321
I'm a big fan.
Love what you're doing.

11:37.390 --> 11:38.605
What are you doing?

11:38.689 --> 11:40.581
I was selling. That's what I was doing.

11:40.650 --> 11:43.011
I don't know what nonsense
this cult was pushing,

11:43.080 --> 11:45.723
but at the end of the day, they were
gonna be in the sauce business.

11:45.791 --> 11:47.482
And so, these peppers

11:47.614 --> 11:50.003
are the heart of Gloria's sauce.

11:50.072 --> 11:53.714
But this is the finished product,
of course...

11:53.814 --> 11:56.428
the Salsa Atomica.

12:03.473 --> 12:05.307
Mmm! Peppery!

12:05.384 --> 12:08.059
She has a sophisticated palate!

12:08.165 --> 12:09.488
Mmm!

12:10.426 --> 12:12.332
I can feel the healing.

12:12.401 --> 12:13.653
Maybe that's why
you're glowing.

12:13.721 --> 12:15.848
Am I crazy or is she glowing?

12:15.965 --> 12:17.809
Totally glowing!

12:18.687 --> 12:22.043
Gloria, I notice that
you're really kind of quiet.

12:22.126 --> 12:23.288
Is that a vitamin D thing?

12:23.357 --> 12:25.215
'Cause we have socks
that can address that.

12:25.284 --> 12:26.660
No, I'm just...

12:26.925 --> 12:29.183
you know, it's hard for me to sell this.

12:29.252 --> 12:31.832
It's been in my family
for five generations.

12:31.971 --> 12:33.429
Most of them had kids at 15.

12:33.506 --> 12:37.199
Things were not always easy
in my village.

12:37.535 --> 12:38.902
But the one thing

12:38.971 --> 12:41.801
that we could always count on
was the sauce

12:41.893 --> 12:45.504
made from this blend
of magical Colombian peppers.

12:45.723 --> 12:47.072
Well, maybe it was just the way

12:47.149 --> 12:48.744
the water came down the mountain

12:48.821 --> 12:51.109
and curved around our family farm.

12:51.186 --> 12:53.396
I love mountains and curves.

12:53.465 --> 12:54.654
So NERP!

12:54.802 --> 12:55.993
You know, I remember

12:56.062 --> 12:58.387
my grandmother cooking for me
every Sunday.

12:58.456 --> 12:59.851
I would hold on to her apron

12:59.920 --> 13:01.578
and follow her around the kitchen

13:01.647 --> 13:03.072
while she prepared her sauce.

13:03.263 --> 13:05.288
She would hold out the spoon to me

13:05.357 --> 13:07.145
and say, "Taste this.

13:07.238 --> 13:08.410
It's your familia."

13:08.479 --> 13:10.704
I feel like NERP is my familia.

13:10.773 --> 13:12.496
Yeah, we were all here on Christmas.

13:12.937 --> 13:15.223
Maybe it is the right time.

13:15.418 --> 13:17.074
My abuela is gone.

13:17.143 --> 13:20.191
My great aunts are all gone.

13:20.929 --> 13:22.856
They straightened the river.

13:22.925 --> 13:24.445
NERP can re-curve it.

13:24.549 --> 13:26.565
Maybe it is the time to say "Goodbye"

13:26.634 --> 13:28.903
to the one thing that is
a real connection to...

13:28.972 --> 13:30.663
You're not saying "Goodbye" to anything.

13:30.772 --> 13:32.518
This deal is done!

13:33.969 --> 13:36.346
I'm so sorry to have put you
in this position.

13:36.518 --> 13:38.531
I will never ask you
to turn your back...

13:38.608 --> 13:40.596
- You blew it, you dummy!
- What?

13:40.665 --> 13:43.178
I wanted to sell
that stupid sauce!

13:45.342 --> 13:47.107
Wait a minute. I'm confused.

13:47.212 --> 13:49.046
Why did you tell her
that the deal was off?

13:49.115 --> 13:51.084
I was trying to protect your legacy.

13:51.153 --> 13:52.449
What legacy? There's not legacy.

13:52.527 --> 13:55.531
I invented that whole story
to drive up the price.

13:55.719 --> 13:58.146
- Are you sure you're in sales?
- What about the pictures?

13:58.215 --> 14:01.890
I cut them out from Manny's
National Geographic old magazines.

14:01.959 --> 14:06.404
Look, there's even a picture
at the Universal Studios tour.

14:06.474 --> 14:08.662
That's the "Psycho" house in the back!

14:08.763 --> 14:10.792
So, you want to get rid of the business?

14:10.884 --> 14:12.848
Yes, I hate that sauce.

14:12.917 --> 14:13.938
It's a dog!

14:14.015 --> 14:16.155
I have storage lockers all over town

14:16.224 --> 14:17.537
full of jars.

14:17.615 --> 14:20.927
I tried to flush it,
but it eats up the pipes.

14:21.021 --> 14:22.334
You could've just told me.

14:22.412 --> 14:24.765
I didn't want to admit
that you were right

14:24.834 --> 14:28.013
and have to hear "I told you so"
for the rest of my life.

14:28.672 --> 14:30.029
Well, your life.

14:30.802 --> 14:33.233
But, it was the first thing
I was doing on my own

14:33.302 --> 14:34.511
after getting married.

14:34.588 --> 14:35.879
And it was a failure.

14:35.956 --> 14:38.549
Honey, you've got to
cut yourself some slack.

14:38.709 --> 14:40.710
Do you know how many ideas
I had to dump

14:40.779 --> 14:42.076
because they weren't working?

14:42.178 --> 14:45.451
I was a silent partner
of a professional Jai Alai league.

14:45.520 --> 14:47.029
With the ball and the scoopy thing?

14:47.098 --> 14:48.357
You guys! What was that?!

14:48.426 --> 14:50.091
Now I'm never gonna get
my own bean bag chair.

14:50.159 --> 14:51.935
No, it's gonna be fine.
We want to sell now.

14:52.004 --> 14:53.638
It's too late. She's moved on.

14:53.771 --> 14:55.427
Nicole doesn't give second chances.

14:55.599 --> 14:56.606
Mostly because that's the name

14:56.674 --> 14:58.638
of a failed rom-com she made
with Andrew McCarthy.

14:58.707 --> 15:00.685
That's where I've seen her before!

15:00.826 --> 15:02.499
Listen, this isn't over.

15:02.623 --> 15:04.804
I've had my back
against the wall before.

15:04.873 --> 15:07.101
Denver, Closet-Con, '97.

15:07.177 --> 15:09.581
I had a warehouse full of cedar shelves.

15:09.740 --> 15:12.646
- A storm blew in over the Rockies...
- You sold the closet. I get it.

15:12.723 --> 15:14.903
- Let's go up there.
- There's a whole story here.

15:16.356 --> 15:18.106
Nicole! Look who came back!

15:18.175 --> 15:19.903
Listen, we were just talking outside,

15:19.972 --> 15:21.397
and maybe I was a little rash.

15:21.589 --> 15:22.817
Really?

15:23.338 --> 15:24.754
Maybe a big rash.

15:24.823 --> 15:26.405
I'm so happy to hear you say that

15:26.474 --> 15:28.459
'cause I haven't been able
to stop eating your salsa

15:28.527 --> 15:29.544
since you left.

15:29.613 --> 15:31.041
There's no way to prove that.

15:31.348 --> 15:32.802
Apropos of nothing,

15:32.871 --> 15:35.683
do you believe in Western medicine?

15:39.217 --> 15:41.134
Ahh! Sweet.

15:41.988 --> 15:43.881
- Luke!
- Dad?

15:43.958 --> 15:45.449
Need you bad, buddy.

15:45.543 --> 15:47.856
- Why are you yelling?
- Oh, don't tell Mom,

15:47.925 --> 15:50.308
but I worked out too hard,
and it clogged my ears.

15:50.386 --> 15:53.208
I need some ice. And a heating pad.
And some aspirin.

15:53.277 --> 15:55.449
And some soft foods,
like Jell-o or soup.

15:55.526 --> 15:57.839
Can you poach an egg?
Can you even hear me?!

15:59.482 --> 16:00.807
Hi.

16:00.892 --> 16:01.949
Okay.

16:02.128 --> 16:03.911
- I'll be right back.
- Okay...?

16:05.621 --> 16:06.759
What's going on?

16:06.836 --> 16:09.379
Don't tell you father,
but I can't move.

16:09.472 --> 16:11.145
Start me a tub
and when it's ready,

16:11.214 --> 16:12.574
carry me upstairs
and put me in it.

16:12.642 --> 16:13.870
Can you boil water for tea?

16:13.947 --> 16:15.001
I guess.

16:15.078 --> 16:16.702
Luke, what happened, chief?

16:16.779 --> 16:18.833
Uh, I'm helping Mom with something!

16:18.902 --> 16:20.091
Don't say that!

16:20.160 --> 16:21.622
Claire, everything okay?!

16:21.691 --> 16:24.047
Yes! I'm just stretching!

16:24.183 --> 16:25.402
Me, too!

16:26.394 --> 16:27.546
Luke!

16:27.623 --> 16:30.441
Uh, he's helping me with
something on the computer!

16:30.510 --> 16:32.034
He's so good at computers!

16:32.103 --> 16:33.949
Oh, such a smart boy!

16:34.018 --> 16:36.011
Okay, all right. This is nuts.

16:36.082 --> 16:38.248
What? No. Oh, boy.

16:41.384 --> 16:42.408
Hi.

16:42.496 --> 16:44.739
Oh, hi, honey.
Hey, sweetie.

16:44.808 --> 16:46.489
Are you good?

16:46.622 --> 16:47.674
Oh, yeah, yeah.

16:47.918 --> 16:49.677
- Are you good?
- So good!

16:49.746 --> 16:51.294
I don't know what's going on here,

16:51.391 --> 16:52.512
but neither of you are good!

16:52.614 --> 16:54.193
If you want someone
to take care of you,

16:54.261 --> 16:57.575
I suggest once you can move,
you make another baby.

17:00.239 --> 17:01.350
You're hurting, too?

17:01.419 --> 17:03.022
That race, it almost destroyed me.

17:03.091 --> 17:05.648
And I have to spend the rest of my life
in this position.

17:05.726 --> 17:06.780
What are we doing?

17:06.857 --> 17:09.255
We're competing like
a couple of 40-year-olds.

17:09.387 --> 17:10.801
I haven't worked out in months.

17:10.872 --> 17:11.917
But, what's up with you?

17:11.994 --> 17:14.090
You're out on that
basketball court all the time.

17:14.184 --> 17:15.246
Claire.

17:18.239 --> 17:20.637
There's someone I'd like
for you to meet...

17:23.823 --> 17:25.646
This is Awesome Possum.

17:25.751 --> 17:26.825
Instead of working out,

17:26.894 --> 17:29.700
my super cool friends and I
have epic robot battles.

17:30.161 --> 17:31.411
The only time I break a sweat

17:31.488 --> 17:33.185
is when we run after
the ice cream truck.

17:33.254 --> 17:34.882
Is this what giving up feels like?

17:35.001 --> 17:37.192
No, not if we do it together.

17:37.474 --> 17:41.053
Let's boldly walk forward
at a reasonable pace

17:41.122 --> 17:42.302
into this new future

17:42.371 --> 17:44.474
where we don't have to pretend
to be strong or fast.

17:44.591 --> 17:46.388
- Can I make a confession?
- Yeah.

17:46.533 --> 17:48.528
Sometimes, I get hungry at,
like, 5:00.

17:48.605 --> 17:49.759
Me, too!

17:49.836 --> 17:51.761
Let's start having early dinners!

17:51.838 --> 17:53.166
It makes so much sense.

17:53.243 --> 17:54.734
Old people are wise.

17:54.811 --> 17:55.907
Oh!

17:56.596 --> 17:59.332
Oh, no, Poss! No!

17:59.409 --> 18:00.509
No! I gave you life!

18:00.578 --> 18:02.188
Dr. Perry, this is Luke Dunphy.

18:02.312 --> 18:03.376
Forget what I said.

18:03.445 --> 18:04.840
I'd like to start college today.

18:04.909 --> 18:06.954
No! Luke!

18:09.015 --> 18:10.698
Mitchell, come in here.

18:12.689 --> 18:15.251
Wow. Small room, big mirror, handcuffs.

18:15.320 --> 18:16.337
Overcharge for drinks,

18:16.406 --> 18:17.635
and this could be a bar
in West Hollywood.

18:17.703 --> 18:18.955
Okay, why aren't you taking this job?

18:19.023 --> 18:20.555
- I don't want to.
- Why not?

18:20.624 --> 18:22.267
You hate freelancing.
You're barely doing it.

18:22.335 --> 18:23.940
I-I'm plenty busy.

18:24.009 --> 18:25.712
Are you? Because you know what?

18:25.832 --> 18:27.019
Lily and I saw you

18:27.088 --> 18:29.040
putting breadcrumbs
in your pocket the other day.

18:29.109 --> 18:31.095
Are you back to spending
your afternoons

18:31.204 --> 18:32.596
with the pigeons in the park,
Mitchell?

18:32.664 --> 18:34.095
W... You know, they're hungry.

18:34.164 --> 18:37.313
No, you're hungry. For a purpose.

18:37.649 --> 18:39.368
It's just not my thing.

18:40.812 --> 18:42.003
Sit down.

18:42.243 --> 18:43.704
Not your thing, huh?

18:44.254 --> 18:46.448
Okay, well, I snapped
this picture of you this afternoon.

18:46.516 --> 18:48.313
Do you recognize the person
in this picture?

18:48.641 --> 18:50.350
Uh, Yes, it's me.
You just said that, so...

18:50.427 --> 18:52.405
Okay, well, what is
the expression on your face?

18:52.474 --> 18:54.825
- What are you doing?
- I asked a question!

18:54.942 --> 18:57.394
"What is the expression
on your face?"

18:57.471 --> 18:58.525
It's a smile.

18:58.602 --> 19:00.545
And how would you describe
this... "smile"?

19:00.614 --> 19:01.895
Well, from ear-to-ear.

19:01.972 --> 19:03.400
Wh-where's Blitz with my donut?

19:03.477 --> 19:07.317
You'll get a donut when I get answers,
you piece of trash!

19:07.396 --> 19:08.451
Hey!

19:08.520 --> 19:09.653
Hey!

19:11.527 --> 19:13.395
Oh, my gosh, what...

19:13.464 --> 19:15.145
what's happening here, huh?

19:15.262 --> 19:16.848
I'm sorry, Mitchell.
You know what?

19:16.917 --> 19:18.176
I'm just here to help you.

19:18.249 --> 19:19.497
Let's just you and me talk.

19:19.566 --> 19:21.745
Are you seriously trying
to good cop/bad cop me?

19:21.814 --> 19:24.149
No, I'm trying to get
some understanding

19:24.259 --> 19:27.095
because I was with you
the entire afternoon

19:27.399 --> 19:30.368
and you can't deny
you had a great time.

19:30.595 --> 19:31.886
Wait a minute... except for when...

19:31.954 --> 19:33.519
when you got out of the car
to chase that guy down.

19:33.587 --> 19:35.899
- Mitchell, what happened?
- Nothing.

19:37.918 --> 19:41.235
Okay, we were chasing after
that deadbeat guy,

19:41.315 --> 19:43.175
and I started... I started
thinking about his kid.

19:43.243 --> 19:46.580
And I just... I wanted
to catch him and make him pay.

19:46.657 --> 19:48.853
And then,
Stablitzky got him on the ground

19:49.510 --> 19:52.533
and I saw his face and he was...
he was scared.

19:52.703 --> 19:55.330
There's a person there.
I don't know the whole story.

19:55.399 --> 19:58.281
I don't think that I can just
toss someone into prison.

19:58.350 --> 19:59.953
- Mitchell, come...
- See? This is why

20:00.056 --> 20:02.013
I didn't tell you, okay?
You're judging me.

20:02.144 --> 20:03.756
You're the tough, justice guy,

20:03.825 --> 20:05.567
and I'm just... I'm soft.

20:05.636 --> 20:07.536
No, you're fair.

20:07.605 --> 20:09.815
And, of course, you can be
thoughtful and sensitive.

20:09.884 --> 20:11.572
But you can be tough.

20:11.698 --> 20:14.388
You remember the woman
in front of us at "Lion King"

20:14.457 --> 20:16.605
with the candy wrappers
and the big, giant hat?

20:16.674 --> 20:18.507
- Whoo, I went crazy on her.
- You sure did.

20:18.576 --> 20:20.067
And it is that passion

20:20.208 --> 20:23.511
that would make you
an amazing prosecutor.

20:23.580 --> 20:25.792
- Do you really think so?
- Of course.

20:26.185 --> 20:27.917
And nothing would thrill me more

20:27.986 --> 20:29.315
than to watch you embark

20:29.384 --> 20:31.198
on this new chapter of your life.

20:31.267 --> 20:32.388
Aww.

20:32.477 --> 20:34.827
It is... it is a lot less money,
though.

20:35.413 --> 20:37.917
Well, you know,
we don't have to decide today.

20:43.512 --> 20:46.880
Guys?
Guys, you forgot me again!

20:47.187 --> 20:49.176
I like tacos too!

20:49.695 --> 20:51.137
Mitchell!

20:52.112 --> 20:53.268
Mitchell!

20:54.442 --> 20:58.247
- Haley? In my office, please.
- Coming!

20:59.409 --> 21:00.590
Okay...

21:03.129 --> 21:06.972
Where are you?
Something happened to my face.

21:09.829 --> 21:13.682
- Okay, I'll...
- I got it.

21:14.248 --> 21:15.605
He's got it.
