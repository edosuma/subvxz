00:13.000 --> 00:14.189
And there's the starting gun,

00:14.224 --> 00:17.442
kicking off the 25th annual
Chronicle Marathon, San Francisco.

00:18.059 --> 00:21.059
Over 6,000 runners in the race today,
and it is perfect running weather.

00:21.859 --> 00:24.747
And there is Tonday Mawwaka, number 534.

00:24.782 --> 00:27.747
What a story he is. The
legendary "Proud Lion."

00:27.993 --> 00:31.794
He's a two-time Olympic champion, and
he's come from his homeland of Nigeria...

00:31.887 --> 00:35.312
to run in today's event, which
he's referred to as his final lap.

00:36.120 --> 00:37.900
Of course, Tonday's
threatened to retire before,

00:37.935 --> 00:40.900
but if this does turn out
to be his valedictory race,

00:41.126 --> 00:42.428
it'll be quite a day to remember.

00:42.463 --> 00:44.359
We'll be checking in with his progress all

00:44.360 --> 00:46.616
through our continuous
coverage of the marathon.

00:48.333 --> 00:50.795
- Two cameras?
- Yeah. In case one breaks.

00:50.830 --> 00:52.021
Where is he?

00:52.056 --> 00:53.373
Well, he won't be near the front.

00:53.408 --> 00:56.373
- I mean, you know, he's
65 years old. - Sixty-three.

00:56.523 --> 00:58.678
He's my idol. Did I mention that?

00:58.713 --> 00:59.852
About a million times.

00:59.887 --> 01:02.852
No, seriously. Tonday Mawwaka is
the greatest runner who ever lived.

01:03.207 --> 01:05.877
I saw him run in Los Angeles in 1973.

01:05.912 --> 01:08.877
He was 400 yards behind
with less than a mile to go.

01:09.131 --> 01:12.026
He had nothing left, and somehow he just

01:12.061 --> 01:15.026
he just found it. It was
the most amazing finish.

01:15.200 --> 01:18.200
I can't believe you never heard of him.

01:20.755 --> 01:22.294
What?

01:22.329 --> 01:25.294
That man. He missed a button.

01:28.436 --> 01:30.140
Don't worry about it, okay?

01:30.175 --> 01:32.244
Come on, just have fun.

01:32.279 --> 01:35.038
Sixty-three years old, he's
still running the marathon.

01:35.073 --> 01:36.603
I've got to get into shape.

01:36.638 --> 01:38.840
- No. You're in great shape.
- Nah. I used to be.

01:38.875 --> 01:40.526
Now if I can't find the remote control,

01:40.561 --> 01:43.526
I just watch whatever's on.

01:44.211 --> 01:47.211
Look at him. How can he stand it?

01:48.037 --> 01:50.309
Hold on to this.

01:50.344 --> 01:51.871
Excuse me, sir.

01:51.906 --> 01:53.429
- You missed a button.
- What?

01:53.464 --> 01:56.429
You missed a button.

01:56.936 --> 01:58.462
- You'll thank me later.
- Oh, oh! Adrian!

01:58.497 --> 02:01.342
Will you get the hell away from me?
I'm trying to enjoy this race here.

02:01.377 --> 02:02.475
Here it is. It's no problem.

02:02.510 --> 02:03.812
- Adrian!
- If you just...

02:03.847 --> 02:06.812
Adrian, he's coming.!

02:07.748 --> 02:09.822
Adrian, would you hurry
up! Look! He's coming!

02:09.857 --> 02:11.686
- These are in the way.
- No, they're not in the way.

02:11.721 --> 02:13.605
- You're in the way!
- I'm very good at buttons.

02:13.640 --> 02:16.605
Get away! Get away! Go! Go!

02:19.572 --> 02:22.572
- There it is. Okay.
- You missed him!

02:24.098 --> 02:27.098
You've just missed him!

02:27.867 --> 02:29.265
Look, he's wearing blue shorts.

02:29.300 --> 02:30.930
Look. There he is. There...

02:30.965 --> 02:33.517
Oh, no, that's not him.

02:33.552 --> 02:36.517
Knowing Trevor, he probably
stopped to sell someone a sofa bed.

02:39.150 --> 02:41.326
Lisa, what is wrong with me?

02:41.361 --> 02:42.955
I can't stand the son of a bitch,

02:42.990 --> 02:45.955
and I'm trying to catch a glimpse
of him. This is ridiculous.

02:46.538 --> 02:49.538
No, I know.

02:49.963 --> 02:52.036
No, I know.

02:52.071 --> 02:55.036
That's why I told him he has to
make up his mind once and for all.

02:55.256 --> 02:58.256
The guy can't have his
cake and eat it too.

02:58.644 --> 03:01.162
Bye.

03:01.197 --> 03:02.972
Hello, Gwen.

03:03.007 --> 03:04.965
Trevor.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.809
What what are you doing here? I
thought you were running the marathon.

03:23.430 --> 03:29.447
MONK Season 1 Epi. 08 Mr.
Monk and the Marathon Man

04:15.320 --> 04:17.221
I can't believe I missed him.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.245
I can't believe I missed Tonday.

04:19.281 --> 04:20.397
Well, it's your own fault.

04:20.432 --> 04:21.855
You should have ignored
the stupid sweater.

04:21.890 --> 04:24.011
- It was askew.
- So what?

04:24.046 --> 04:26.156
So what? Why can't you
just let people be askew?

04:26.191 --> 04:29.685
- What are you, the askew police?
- Yes, I'm the askew police.

04:32.237 --> 04:34.957
- What's going on?
- Is that the captain?

04:36.023 --> 04:39.023
You got two out, two kids on,
first and third, all right?

04:39.172 --> 04:41.486
- My kid throws a fastball like...
- Captain. Captain.!

04:41.521 --> 04:42.878
- What?
- I just talked to the building manager.

04:42.913 --> 04:44.743
- He's on his way.
- Okay, all right.

04:44.778 --> 04:46.732
Work the street. Get
statements from everybody.

04:46.767 --> 04:49.149
- Let's get to it. This is not going
to go away. - Yes, sir.

04:49.184 --> 04:50.829
This is supposed to be my day off!

04:50.864 --> 04:53.013
You're telling me.

04:53.048 --> 04:54.240
Monk, what are you doing here?

04:54.275 --> 04:55.469
You chasing ambulances now?

04:55.504 --> 04:56.762
We were just driving by.

04:56.797 --> 04:57.806
What do ya got?

04:57.841 --> 04:59.685
We got a dead girl.

04:59.720 --> 05:01.650
She lives on the 21 st floor.

05:01.685 --> 05:06.092
Either she slipped or she
jumped or she had some help.

05:07.686 --> 05:09.834
- It was murder.
- It's a possibility, yeah.

05:09.869 --> 05:12.741
No, that's what happened. It was murder.

05:12.776 --> 05:15.575
And how can you know that,
Monk? You just got here.

05:15.610 --> 05:17.259
Her toenails.

05:17.294 --> 05:19.020
She didn't finish painting them.

05:19.055 --> 05:20.415
She was obviously interrupted.

05:20.450 --> 05:22.399
Isn't that the style now?

05:22.434 --> 05:24.666
Like you know.

05:24.701 --> 05:26.122
I think you might be right.

05:26.157 --> 05:27.153
Go ahead.

05:27.188 --> 05:29.764
Anyway, we'll know soon enough when
the medical examiner looks at her.

05:33.149 --> 05:34.515
Gum?

05:34.550 --> 05:35.491
Thanks for dropping by.

05:35.526 --> 05:37.076
- Yeah. Good luck with this.
- It's good to see ya.

05:37.111 --> 05:38.280
Yeah.

05:38.315 --> 05:41.280
As long as you're here, you
want to make a few bucks?

05:42.050 --> 05:44.884
- Sure.
- Good.

05:45.892 --> 05:48.406
- Contract.
- Excellent.

05:49.615 --> 05:51.005
That's what I thought.

05:51.040 --> 05:53.233
Thanks, Paul.

05:53.268 --> 05:54.605
Boys and girls, listen up.

05:54.640 --> 05:56.664
That was the medical examiner.

05:56.699 --> 05:58.482
She was strangled before
she went over the edge.

05:58.517 --> 06:01.032
This is now a homicide investigation,

06:01.067 --> 06:03.035
which means do not touch anything,

06:03.070 --> 06:05.237
don't lean on anything and
be careful where you walk.

06:07.017 --> 06:08.530
What do you think?

06:08.565 --> 06:09.982
She lived alone?

06:10.017 --> 06:12.503
Yeah, she lived alone, but check this out.

06:13.548 --> 06:15.266
Excuse me.

06:15.301 --> 06:18.039
She has beer in the fridge...

06:18.615 --> 06:21.615
and cigars in the humidor.

06:22.573 --> 06:23.782
Boyfriend.

06:23.817 --> 06:25.034
Yeah, and according to her neighbor,

06:25.069 --> 06:28.500
she had an ex-husband and a
boyfriend who nobody ever saw.

06:29.871 --> 06:32.534
Well, somebody was paying the
bills. She was on unemployment.

06:32.569 --> 06:35.534
And somebody was buying
her a lot of gifts.

06:35.696 --> 06:38.247
She hasn't opened any of them.

06:38.282 --> 06:40.187
Maybe she was planning to return them.

06:40.222 --> 06:42.249
I mean, look at this guy's taste.

06:42.284 --> 06:44.933
What are you talking about? This
stuff is great. I mean, look at this...

06:44.968 --> 06:47.488
Sharona. Evidence.

06:47.523 --> 06:48.942
Oh.

06:48.977 --> 06:50.575
Do you smell that?

06:50.610 --> 06:53.148
No.

06:53.183 --> 06:54.955
- What is that?
- Chamomile.

06:54.990 --> 06:57.080
It's an herb. It grows wild, like a weed.

06:57.115 --> 06:59.483
- I know what chamomile is.
- Used to make tea.

06:59.518 --> 07:02.483
- Yeah. Check the kitchen for
chamomile tea. - Yes, sir.

07:03.801 --> 07:07.267
Captain. Look at this.

07:08.761 --> 07:10.195
Her speed dial.

07:10.230 --> 07:13.195
Number three is blank.

07:14.379 --> 07:17.641
If she had a lover, and she
was trying to be discreet...

07:18.198 --> 07:20.771
She would not have listed his name.

07:20.806 --> 07:22.650
I've got it, sir.

07:22.685 --> 07:24.183
Wait.

07:33.386 --> 07:36.386
- Hello?
- Hi.

07:36.394 --> 07:39.994
This is Captain Leland Stottlemeyer
with the San Francisco Police Department.

07:40.026 --> 07:41.094
Whom am I talking to?

07:41.129 --> 07:42.609
Hey, it's me, Trevor McDowell.

07:42.644 --> 07:44.222
We've just opened a new
furniture showroom...

07:44.257 --> 07:47.143
right here in San Mateo,
right off Route 101.

07:47.178 --> 07:47.676
Break!

07:48.598 --> 07:50.338
Hey, listen, if your family's like mine,

07:50.373 --> 07:53.110
the furniture in your
house takes a real beating.!

07:53.145 --> 07:55.544
Okay, keep it clean!
Keep it clean! Gloves up!

07:55.824 --> 07:58.395
That's why you need furniture
that can go the distance.

07:58.430 --> 07:59.624
Isn't that right, honey?

07:59.659 --> 08:01.911
With low prices that'll knock you out!

08:01.946 --> 08:04.685
Like this couch. It's regularly 799,

08:04.720 --> 08:06.667
but with a quick jab from Tyler,

08:06.702 --> 08:08.872
that old price is T. K. O.'ed!

08:08.907 --> 08:11.125
- It's yours for only 649.!
- You see that lamp there? It's got...

08:11.160 --> 08:13.597
- Don't even think about it.
- But it's not...

08:13.632 --> 08:15.111
Stop. Stop. It's supposed to...

08:15.146 --> 08:18.111
Normally it's 1399, but with
a mighty blow from Luke, here...

08:18.364 --> 08:20.895
Whoa! That old price
is down for the count!

08:20.930 --> 08:23.895
It's yours for only 1299!

08:24.242 --> 08:27.242
Heavyweight furniture
at featherweight prices.

08:27.789 --> 08:29.957
Tables! Chairs! Sofas! Lamps!

08:29.992 --> 08:31.571
Love seats! You name it!

08:31.606 --> 08:34.448
At McDowell's, if we
can't beat the competition,

08:34.484 --> 08:35.950
we'll throw in the towel!

08:35.985 --> 08:38.350
- Cut.! Cut.! Who is that?
- What?

08:38.385 --> 08:39.556
Get him out of there.!

08:39.591 --> 08:41.984
I'm sorry. It was a little... Was I...

08:42.019 --> 08:44.329
Okay, take two.

08:44.364 --> 08:46.047
Oh, my God.

08:46.082 --> 08:48.927
- Trevor McDowell?
- Yes, sir?

08:48.962 --> 08:50.299
I'd like to talk to you.

08:50.334 --> 08:51.855
What's going on?

08:51.890 --> 08:53.085
Nothing serious.

08:53.120 --> 08:56.063
I think maybe one of his
employees is passing bad checks.

08:56.098 --> 08:57.538
Honey, I'm sure it's okay.

08:57.573 --> 09:00.011
Take the kids inside and
I'll see you in a little bit.

09:00.046 --> 09:01.359
Okay. Come on, guys.

09:01.394 --> 09:04.359
Good work today, guys.

09:05.110 --> 09:06.947
You've got a beautiful
family, Mr. McDowell.

09:06.982 --> 09:09.947
You don't have to tell me that.

09:10.414 --> 09:11.500
Can I get you anything?

09:11.535 --> 09:12.749
Nothing for me, thanks.

09:12.784 --> 09:14.853
Have a seat. Water?

09:14.888 --> 09:17.853
Oh, no, thank you. It's okay.

09:17.921 --> 09:19.451
So, about Gwen,

09:19.486 --> 09:21.788
I heard about it on the news,
but they said she was murdered.

09:21.823 --> 09:24.788
- Is that true?
- That's true.

09:24.971 --> 09:27.034
Horrible. Do you have any leads?

09:27.069 --> 09:28.771
We're workin' on it.

09:28.806 --> 09:31.121
She was your girlfriend.

09:31.156 --> 09:34.121
Yes, sir.

09:34.199 --> 09:35.933
I really screwed up big time.

09:35.968 --> 09:38.131
How long have you been screwing up?

09:38.166 --> 09:39.178
I met her two years ago.

09:39.213 --> 09:42.178
She was an actress in
one of my commercials.

09:42.895 --> 09:44.544
She was the girl in the water bed.

09:44.579 --> 09:47.165
Oh, my God. I remember
that one. Yeah, yeah.

09:47.694 --> 09:49.389
I liked that commercial.

09:49.424 --> 09:51.625
- You're a natural in front of the camera.
- Oh, thank you.

09:51.660 --> 09:53.598
Do you drink tea, Mr. McDowell?

09:54.690 --> 09:56.772
Uh, sometimes, yes.

09:56.807 --> 09:59.772
- Chamomile tea?
- No.

09:59.908 --> 10:02.723
The building manager said
you'd been paying her rent.

10:02.758 --> 10:04.140
He also said you called him a month ago

10:04.175 --> 10:06.368
to say you would not
be renewing the lease.

10:06.403 --> 10:08.623
That's correct. I was
trying to break it off

10:08.658 --> 10:11.122
when I realized I made a mistake.

10:11.157 --> 10:13.373
My family's my life.

10:13.408 --> 10:16.237
- Gwen understood that.
- Did she?

10:16.272 --> 10:18.373
I thought she did. We talked about it.

10:18.408 --> 10:20.910
Do you have an alibi
for 7:55 this morning?

10:22.911 --> 10:25.577
7:55, I would have been...

10:26.018 --> 10:28.495
on... Haight Street.

10:28.933 --> 10:29.879
Anybody see you there?

10:29.914 --> 10:33.566
Oh, yes, about a thousand people.
See, I was running in a marathon.

10:35.836 --> 10:37.824
You realize we have
several ways to verify that.

10:37.859 --> 10:40.608
Good, because the sooner you clear me,

10:40.643 --> 10:43.608
the sooner you can catch
the bastard who did this.

10:44.141 --> 10:46.288
That's my card with my office
number. That's my home number.

10:46.323 --> 10:47.752
If there's anything I can do to help,

10:47.787 --> 10:49.145
please don't hesitate to call.

10:49.180 --> 10:50.725
I'll be in touch.

10:50.760 --> 10:51.779
Good luck with the investigation.

10:51.814 --> 10:53.216
Okay, that's a wrap.!

10:53.251 --> 10:56.056
How'd you do?

10:56.091 --> 10:57.062
Excuse me?

10:57.097 --> 10:58.617
In the marathon.

10:58.652 --> 11:00.216
How'd you do?

11:00.251 --> 11:02.200
Three hours, 41 minutes.

11:02.235 --> 11:03.875
Personal best, actually. I've
been training like a demon.

11:04.414 --> 11:06.439
Were you drafting or running open field?

11:07.300 --> 11:09.204
Open field. You a runner?

11:09.239 --> 11:11.627
Uh, years ago. High school.

11:11.662 --> 11:14.065
Made All-State.

11:14.100 --> 11:17.065
You ran?

11:19.013 --> 11:20.060
What?

11:20.095 --> 11:21.921
I just can't picture you on a track team.

11:21.956 --> 11:24.067
I had a life, you know, before we met.

11:24.467 --> 11:27.467
Oh, no, no. I know you had a life.

11:28.623 --> 11:31.173
I just didn't think it
involved wearing gym shorts...

11:31.208 --> 11:32.744
and showering with other guys.

11:32.779 --> 11:34.239
I didn't shower with other guys.

11:34.274 --> 11:35.552
I had a note from my doctor.

11:35.587 --> 11:37.007
I bet you had lots of
notes from your doctor.

11:37.042 --> 11:38.358
As a matter of fact, I did.

11:38.393 --> 11:41.358
I had a whole, separate binder.

11:41.524 --> 11:42.752
What are we doing here

11:42.787 --> 11:44.696
when the captain already
checked this guy out?

11:44.731 --> 11:46.377
He definitely ran the marathon.

11:46.412 --> 11:48.730
I know. I just... I
just want to make sure.

11:55.158 --> 11:57.448
Hello. Can we help you?

11:57.483 --> 11:59.152
Oh, no. It's a stampede. Get a wipe ready.

11:59.187 --> 12:00.424
Oh.

12:00.839 --> 12:02.958
I'm Adrian Monk. I called earlier.

12:02.993 --> 12:05.828
Oh, Mr. Monk. Please excuse the mess.

12:06.163 --> 12:09.163
After the marathon, wejust kind
of hibernate for a while, you know.

12:10.615 --> 12:12.609
- This is my assistant Sharona.
- Hi.

12:12.644 --> 12:15.609
Oh, I'm this year's
chairperson, Angie Morrison.

12:15.815 --> 12:18.928
- This is Tillie Graves, Cicily Fraiser,
- Hi.

12:19.996 --> 12:21.420
- And Brandon Connelly over there.
- Got it.

12:21.876 --> 12:23.885
- Brandon Connelly,
- hi.

12:24.423 --> 12:27.003
And this is CarlJenkins.
He's our chief of security.

12:27.560 --> 12:29.310
- Hi, Carl.
- Hi.

12:29.677 --> 12:31.991
Thank you.

12:33.945 --> 12:35.378
You got a problem with me?

12:35.413 --> 12:37.794
What? Oh, no, no, no.

12:37.819 --> 12:40.170
You don't want to shake a
brother's hand, you just say so.

12:40.205 --> 12:41.870
You don't gotta go wiping it off.

12:41.905 --> 12:43.237
Oh, no. He does that to everybody.

12:43.272 --> 12:45.083
Am I blind? Do I look like I'm blind?

12:45.295 --> 12:48.295
I saw what I saw.

12:50.532 --> 12:52.763
I'm gonna go and lock up downstairs.

12:52.798 --> 12:55.234
If I stick around here, I
might do something I'll regret.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.738
- We're all just people, Mr. Monk.
- Of course we are.

12:59.930 --> 13:03.249
L-I always have to... I'm not...

13:03.828 --> 13:05.364
- Oh, no. He's not.
- What can we do for you?

13:10.202 --> 13:11.616
I just need some information.

13:11.651 --> 13:16.952
- How many people ran in
the marathon today? - 6,111.

13:17.270 --> 13:19.457
People of all colors and creeds.

13:19.492 --> 13:20.950
I'm sure they were.

13:20.985 --> 13:23.950
I wouldn't have it any other way.

13:24.826 --> 13:26.594
Um, how do you keep track of them all?

13:26.629 --> 13:29.594
Oh, That's all computerized.

13:29.983 --> 13:31.906
The runners are all issued one of these,

13:31.941 --> 13:34.421
and it attaches to the top of their shoe.

13:34.456 --> 13:37.362
There's a teeny, tiny little
computer chip inside there.

13:37.397 --> 13:40.494
We've got scanners at the starting
line and another at the finish line,

13:40.533 --> 13:42.275
and they read the computer chip.

13:42.310 --> 13:43.708
It's all very modern.

13:43.743 --> 13:46.487
We've got everybody's time
right down to a 10th of a second.

13:47.827 --> 13:52.375
But what if someone left the
race and then came back later?

13:53.442 --> 13:56.494
Well, we'd know right away. We've
got checkpoints all along the route.

13:56.512 --> 14:00.072
We had scanners every mile to keep track.

14:00.568 --> 14:03.815
Um, we're interested in a
runner named Trevor McDowell.

14:04.110 --> 14:07.968
Oh, McDowell, number 948.

14:08.344 --> 14:11.344
The police were asking about him earlier.

14:12.041 --> 14:12.990
There he is.

14:13.025 --> 14:16.594
Yeah, he ran it in three hours,
41 minutes and 22 seconds.

14:16.702 --> 14:18.055
That's a really respectable time.

14:18.090 --> 14:21.055
Quite respectable. All
of our racers are winners,

14:21.205 --> 14:24.205
be they black, white or Latino.

14:24.473 --> 14:26.640
It takes many colors to make a rainbow.

14:26.675 --> 14:28.377
Yes, ma'am.

14:28.412 --> 14:31.217
L... I'm a big rainbow guy.

14:32.671 --> 14:35.671
He loves rainbows.

14:37.978 --> 14:39.539
About Mr. McDowell,

14:39.574 --> 14:41.115
did he miss any checkpoints?

14:41.150 --> 14:43.140
Oh, let's have a look.

14:43.175 --> 14:46.913
Uh, no. He ran the whole
course start to finish.

14:48.022 --> 14:51.022
Paced himself beautifully, though.

15:00.208 --> 15:01.969
Mr. Zaleski?

15:02.004 --> 15:04.195
How about I call you Arthur?

15:04.230 --> 15:06.771
- Well, you can call me whatever
the hell you want. - Good.

15:07.493 --> 15:09.293
How long were you and Gwen married?

15:09.328 --> 15:11.049
Four years.

15:11.084 --> 15:13.568
She walked out, and you still loved her.

15:13.603 --> 15:15.173
Sure. I had feelings for her.

15:15.208 --> 15:16.761
I bet you did.

15:16.796 --> 15:19.761
Then she picks up with the
dinette furniture salesman.

15:20.661 --> 15:23.612
TVguy. That's humiliating.
You werejealous.

15:24.497 --> 15:27.057
You became furious.

15:27.092 --> 15:30.057
I'd feel the same way.

15:30.773 --> 15:32.894
I don't like this, being here.

15:33.331 --> 15:35.046
You're not supposed to
like being here, Arthur.

15:35.081 --> 15:38.014
This is an interrogation
room. It's not a sports bar.

15:38.049 --> 15:39.404
- I need a wipe.
- Why?

15:39.439 --> 15:40.213
Do you have a wipe?

15:40.248 --> 15:43.213
So why were you harassing your ex-wife?

15:43.382 --> 15:45.001
We've got the phone records, Artie.

15:45.036 --> 15:46.379
You were calling her twice a day.

15:46.414 --> 15:48.168
I don't call my wife twice a day.

15:48.203 --> 15:49.919
I was worried about her.

15:49.954 --> 15:52.394
You call it "worried."
Thejudge called it "stalking."

15:52.450 --> 15:55.450
That was three years ago.

15:57.426 --> 15:58.535
What happened, Arthur?

15:58.570 --> 16:00.539
You went over there to talk, right?

16:00.574 --> 16:03.031
You lost your temper
trying to talk to her?

16:05.691 --> 16:07.309
Everybody has a temper.

16:07.344 --> 16:09.098
What is that? What is that noise?

16:09.133 --> 16:12.985
Excuse me. Come on.

16:15.194 --> 16:17.588
Okay, one more time from the top.

16:17.623 --> 16:20.131
- So how long were you and Gwen married?
- How's it going in there?

16:20.606 --> 16:21.688
It's going great,

16:21.723 --> 16:24.587
except he wants to know what the little
squeaky noise behind the mirror is.

16:24.883 --> 16:26.848
That might have been me.

16:26.883 --> 16:29.445
There's a smudge. I
think it's on your side.

16:29.678 --> 16:32.171
You can get it when you go back in.

16:32.206 --> 16:34.029
I'm sorry.

16:35.926 --> 16:37.562
You think he's the guy?

16:37.597 --> 16:39.303
It's possible.

16:39.338 --> 16:41.352
He had a restraining order
against him at one time,

16:41.387 --> 16:42.730
which apparently he honored.

16:42.765 --> 16:45.691
He says he was at home in bed at the time.

16:45.726 --> 16:48.691
I'd say he's a
D-plus, a C-minus.

16:49.154 --> 16:49.919
What do you got?

16:49.954 --> 16:52.454
- Trevor McDowell.
- No. He was running the marathon.

16:52.711 --> 16:55.424
- It checked out. - I don't know
how he did it, but he's the guy.

16:56.340 --> 16:58.041
I'll tell you why.

16:58.076 --> 16:59.982
Because Gwen was killed first,

17:00.017 --> 17:01.927
then she was thrown off the balcony.

17:01.962 --> 17:02.657
That's the key.

17:02.692 --> 17:06.007
Why would the killer
draw attention to himself?

17:06.892 --> 17:08.054
There's only one reason:

17:08.089 --> 17:10.464
To establish the exact time of death.

17:10.738 --> 17:13.801
He wanted everyone to know
precisely when she died.

17:14.036 --> 17:16.185
Why? Because he had an alibi.

17:16.221 --> 17:18.212
An airtight alibi.

17:20.380 --> 17:21.530
What do you think?

17:21.565 --> 17:22.840
What do I think?

17:22.876 --> 17:25.415
I think it's not possible because
he was wearing a computer chip.

17:26.441 --> 17:28.711
And he passed all the checkpoints.

17:28.746 --> 17:31.286
I know. You're right. That's right.

17:31.985 --> 17:34.702
Unless he took the chip off and
passed it off to another runner.

17:38.541 --> 17:40.424
That's interesting.

17:41.063 --> 17:43.923
Yeah. Maybe he dropped it
in another guy's pocket...

17:43.958 --> 17:46.923
so it looked like he finished the race.

17:49.048 --> 17:52.048
That's very interesting.

17:52.395 --> 17:55.316
You are a genius.

17:55.351 --> 17:58.316
Anything else I can help you with?

17:58.889 --> 18:00.825
Give him a wipe. Just give him one.

18:01.050 --> 18:03.429
Smudge stays. You go.

18:05.222 --> 18:07.044
So now we're looking for two runners.

18:07.079 --> 18:08.545
That's right. We're
looking for another runner

18:08.580 --> 18:11.545
who had the exact same
time as Trevor McDowell.

18:11.565 --> 18:13.934
Right, right. Someone who was neck
and neck with him for the whole race.

18:14.434 --> 18:16.621
Neck and neck. Okay. That
shouldn't be too hard.

18:20.154 --> 18:21.259
Hi, Tillie.

18:23.082 --> 18:26.082
No. Sorry. Nobody else
had the exact same time.

18:26.921 --> 18:29.149
Look, um, are we finished here?

18:29.184 --> 18:32.047
Just one more thing. Was
there another runner...

18:32.261 --> 18:35.261
whose time at all the checkpoints
was close to McDowell's,

18:35.322 --> 18:37.715
like within a second or two?

18:37.750 --> 18:38.835
Close?

18:40.842 --> 18:43.503
Mm-hmm. Uh, well, look at that.

18:44.569 --> 18:47.899
There's a runner here who ran the whole
race just a few paces from Mr. McDowell.

18:48.175 --> 18:51.639
Number 534. Here's the printout.

18:54.355 --> 18:56.585
Who is it?

18:57.224 --> 18:59.881
Sharona?

19:00.400 --> 19:01.920
Tonday.

19:02.158 --> 19:04.490
Tonday?

19:08.246 --> 19:10.475
You know, I read an
article about this hotel.

19:10.510 --> 19:12.052
- You know how much a suite costs?
- Huh?

19:12.797 --> 19:14.760
$2,000 a night.

19:15.036 --> 19:17.372
You said Tonday was a simple,
quiet man, like a poet.

19:17.670 --> 19:18.294
So?

19:18.847 --> 19:21.630
So how many poets could
afford to stay here?

19:21.665 --> 19:23.287
What are you saying?

19:23.322 --> 19:25.841
I'm saying that he could
have made some extra money...

19:26.379 --> 19:29.258
helping a rich furniture
salesman kill his mistress.

19:29.656 --> 19:32.231
Shh! That is not possible, okay?

19:32.526 --> 19:34.694
It is off the table. End of discussion.

19:36.984 --> 19:39.460
Don't touch anything.

19:39.495 --> 19:41.113
You're telling me not to touch anything?

19:41.148 --> 19:42.978
That's Tonday's fruit.

19:43.013 --> 19:45.593
Sorry to keep you waiting.

19:45.628 --> 19:47.840
Tonday Mawwaka.

19:47.875 --> 19:48.950
Adrian Monk.

19:48.985 --> 19:50.954
Ah, Adrian!

19:50.989 --> 19:52.817
How nice to meet you.

19:52.852 --> 19:53.824
Sir, I...

19:53.859 --> 19:56.484
I have admired you ever since
I was a very strong child...

19:56.760 --> 19:57.799
- Young child.
- Young child.

19:58.357 --> 20:00.700
This is Sharona, my...

20:01.973 --> 20:04.425
my... something.

20:05.819 --> 20:07.986
I'm his assistant.

20:08.021 --> 20:10.891
It's an honor to meet you, Mr. Mawwaka.

20:10.926 --> 20:13.280
Just call me Tonday.

20:13.315 --> 20:15.348
Please, come on. Let's sit.

20:15.383 --> 20:17.578
Make yourselves comfortable.

20:17.613 --> 20:21.737
Sir, I saw you run in Los Angeles in 1973.

20:23.113 --> 20:24.954
- The big comeback.
- Yeah.

20:24.989 --> 20:27.834
I still don't know how I did it.

20:27.869 --> 20:30.834
Well, it changed my life.

20:32.019 --> 20:35.842
You... You were... You are a...

20:37.489 --> 20:39.761
Um...Adrian was a runner too.

20:40.118 --> 20:42.431
Ah, is that so?

20:42.466 --> 20:44.672
- What were you running?
- L-I-I ran what you ran.

20:45.330 --> 20:46.977
Just not as fast.

20:47.012 --> 20:49.537
- You still run?
- No. No, I quit.

20:50.605 --> 20:52.018
Why?

20:53.393 --> 20:55.397
There... There was an incident.

20:55.611 --> 20:57.859
In high school, during a race.

20:58.398 --> 21:00.793
So they broke your spirits.

21:02.226 --> 21:05.302
You know, spirits are very fragile,

21:06.613 --> 21:08.592
easy to break,

21:08.627 --> 21:12.444
but not impossible to repair.

21:14.688 --> 21:16.486
I like that.

21:16.521 --> 21:18.682
You know, the hotel manager tells me

21:18.717 --> 21:20.562
that you were with the police?

21:20.597 --> 21:23.132
I'm helping the police.

21:23.167 --> 21:25.648
- Ayoung woman has been killed.
- Oh.

21:26.755 --> 21:29.286
Have some tea!

21:29.321 --> 21:31.278
- Oh, thank you.
- There you go.

21:32.101 --> 21:35.066
Tonday, we're interested
in another runner...

21:36.503 --> 21:39.022
Trevor McDowell. Do you know him?

21:39.057 --> 21:42.542
- No.
- No. Okay. All right. Wait a second.

21:42.815 --> 21:44.127
Okay, hold on.

21:44.162 --> 21:45.781
Okay. Just try... try that one.

21:45.816 --> 21:48.113
What? No. I tried this one already.

21:48.148 --> 21:49.603
It doesn't... I tried it.

21:49.638 --> 21:51.160
Well, you're holding it the wrong way.

21:51.195 --> 21:52.651
You're not even... Give it to me.

21:52.686 --> 21:55.651
No, let me do it. I can do it.

21:56.050 --> 21:58.329
Oh. There... There it is.

21:58.364 --> 22:00.860
Thank you. That old man is me?

22:00.895 --> 22:02.249
That's you.

22:02.284 --> 22:04.434
And there's McDowell right behind you.

22:04.469 --> 22:06.304
According to the computer,
he said that he was behind you

22:06.339 --> 22:08.164
or just in front of
you for the whole race.

22:08.199 --> 22:11.692
Ok, And later... later
in the race...here...

22:12.475 --> 22:14.638
you see, McDowell's disappeared.

22:14.673 --> 22:17.593
He doesn't show up
again until the very end.

22:18.293 --> 22:21.453
Do you remember if he was
near you the entire time?

22:22.194 --> 22:24.238
I'm sorry. When I'm running,

22:24.273 --> 22:26.378
I'm not thinking about other runners.

22:26.413 --> 22:27.851
I'm testing myself.

22:27.886 --> 22:31.201
Um, I-I really love this place.

22:31.755 --> 22:34.755
Um, does the marathon
committee pay for all of this?

22:37.438 --> 22:40.438
You ask me if I can
afford a suite like this?

22:41.002 --> 22:41.958
No.

22:41.993 --> 22:43.998
Well, a month ago,

22:44.033 --> 22:49.557
I signed a big contract
with a big shoe company.

22:50.417 --> 22:52.907
Let me guess. Size ten.

23:00.705 --> 23:02.031
Did you hear what he said to me?

23:02.066 --> 23:04.098
"From one runner to another."

23:04.133 --> 23:05.608
Remember Tonday gave me some tea?

23:05.643 --> 23:06.646
Yeah.

23:06.681 --> 23:09.807
Well, I saved the tea bag.

23:10.384 --> 23:12.821
- What is it?
- Chamomile.

23:24.027 --> 23:25.968
Let it go. It's a coincidence.

23:26.285 --> 23:28.751
You think it's just a coincidence
that your hero, Tonday,

23:28.786 --> 23:31.169
- drinks chamomile tea?
- Yes, I do.

23:31.204 --> 23:34.169
I love these sneakers.

23:34.347 --> 23:36.350
Oh, I see. I see.

23:36.385 --> 23:38.626
Whenever I think of something,
it's just a coincidence.

23:38.661 --> 23:40.619
Whenever you think of
something, it's a work of genius.

23:40.654 --> 23:42.683
Exactly. It was McDowell.

23:42.444 --> 23:43.964
He did it.

23:43.999 --> 23:46.192
- How?
- Don't know yet.

23:47.667 --> 23:50.480
Okay. Well, according to this video,

23:52.134 --> 23:56.965
Tonday came through here
at 47 minutes, 15 seconds,

23:57.336 --> 24:00.336
and McDowell was a few seconds behind him.

24:01.659 --> 24:04.220
Amazing. Am I touching the ground?

24:04.313 --> 24:07.313
Because I don't feel the ground.

24:08.823 --> 24:11.823
Did I mention these were a
gift from my friend Tonday?

24:12.166 --> 24:13.253
What are you doing?

24:13.288 --> 24:14.826
I'm running circles around you.

24:14.861 --> 24:17.335
That's how fast I am.

24:17.370 --> 24:20.335
Oh, you think you're faster than me, huh?

24:23.858 --> 24:27.097
Okay, from here to that pole and back.

24:27.595 --> 24:28.573
Fine.

24:29.864 --> 24:31.876
This should be easy for you.
You're good at touching poles.

24:31.911 --> 24:35.523
Oh, now I'm not gonna be able to
run because I'm laughing so hard.

24:36.650 --> 24:38.114
Okay.

24:39.727 --> 24:43.004
- Ready, get set, go...
- All right, hold it, wait.

24:43.260 --> 24:45.382
This line's a little crooked.

24:45.417 --> 24:47.403
It's straight enough.

24:47.438 --> 24:48.653
Okay, good.

24:49.961 --> 24:54.029
- On your mark...
- Hold it, hold it. Wait.

24:57.100 --> 25:00.100
It doesn't have to be perfect.

25:05.622 --> 25:07.785
Oh, forget it!

25:07.820 --> 25:10.785
Just forget it.

25:11.862 --> 25:13.782
He's like...

25:13.817 --> 25:15.296
He's driving me insane.

25:15.331 --> 25:16.647
That's it! I got it!

25:16.682 --> 25:18.504
It's perfect now. W-Wait.

25:19.975 --> 25:21.411
Okay, after this point,

25:21.446 --> 25:24.411
McDowell is no longer visible on the tape.

25:30.162 --> 25:31.551
This is it.

25:32.090 --> 25:33.681
It's a blind spot right here.

25:33.716 --> 25:36.090
You see how the path curves?

25:36.125 --> 25:37.907
No room for spectators.

25:37.942 --> 25:39.726
If he timed it right,

25:41.441 --> 25:43.258
he'd be completely alone.

25:43.293 --> 25:46.258
He could duck behind those bushes.

25:47.052 --> 25:50.052
Nobody would miss him.

25:51.369 --> 25:53.373
When were they here?

25:53.408 --> 25:57.366
Um, one hour and five
minutes into the race.

26:00.790 --> 26:02.651
Start the watch.

26:02.686 --> 26:05.651
We're gonna time this out.

26:14.186 --> 26:16.859
Stop the watch.

26:16.894 --> 26:19.734
What is it?

26:19.769 --> 26:21.418
- Smell it.
- Ooh. No.

26:22.158 --> 26:23.287
It's chamomile.

26:23.322 --> 26:25.677
We'll have the lab check for
traces at the crime scene.

26:25.712 --> 26:26.924
What was he doing here?

26:26.959 --> 26:28.945
Changing his clothes.

26:28.980 --> 26:31.945
Start the stopwatch.

26:33.304 --> 26:34.392
What are you doing?

26:34.427 --> 26:36.270
Changing my clothes.

26:36.305 --> 26:39.042
Would you mind? Please.

26:47.795 --> 26:49.456
Then he had to get across town.

26:49.491 --> 26:52.456
Oh.! There's a road over there.

26:55.374 --> 26:56.973
He couldn't have parked here.

26:57.008 --> 26:59.973
This street was blocked
off on Sunday, remember?

27:00.088 --> 27:02.413
He couldn't have parked anywhere.

27:02.448 --> 27:03.528
Well, maybe he didn't drive.

27:03.563 --> 27:06.528
Then how did he get across town?

27:14.376 --> 27:16.121
How are we doing?

27:16.156 --> 27:18.252
Seventeen minutes, twenty seconds.

27:18.287 --> 27:21.252
Excuse me.

27:21.900 --> 27:23.718
Why don't you sit down?

27:23.753 --> 27:26.718
Well, at least hold the pole.

27:26.734 --> 27:27.993
How do you explain this:

27:28.028 --> 27:29.463
I touch everything you're afraid to touch,

27:29.498 --> 27:31.017
and I never get sick.

27:31.052 --> 27:33.019
I can't explain it.

27:33.054 --> 27:34.310
It's inexplicable.

27:34.345 --> 27:36.328
No. You're inexplicable.

27:38.557 --> 27:39.746
So are you gonna tell me?

27:39.781 --> 27:40.547
What?

27:40.582 --> 27:42.857
Why you quit running. You
said there was an incident.

27:42.892 --> 27:45.857
Uh, ancient history.

27:46.037 --> 27:48.913
Come on. You know you're gonna tell me.

27:48.948 --> 27:51.055
Okay, fine.

27:51.090 --> 27:54.055
May 2, 1974.

27:54.723 --> 27:56.822
Our high school track team.

27:56.857 --> 27:58.155
We had a great year.

27:58.190 --> 28:00.685
We made it to the All-State conference.

28:00.720 --> 28:02.463
It was the biggest day of my life.

28:02.498 --> 28:03.935
It was all tied up.

28:03.970 --> 28:07.318
It came down to the last
event: The 1500 meter.

28:07.694 --> 28:09.836
Everyone was depending on me.

28:09.871 --> 28:12.389
Butjust before the gun,

28:12.424 --> 28:15.389
I looked down, and my laces were,

28:15.784 --> 28:18.784
you know, uneven.

28:20.269 --> 28:24.853
- It was the first time that I had a
problem like that in public. - Come on!

28:29.269 --> 28:31.049
Never ran again.

28:31.084 --> 28:32.743
That must have been terrible.

28:32.778 --> 28:34.376
I got over it.

28:34.411 --> 28:35.612
No, you didn't.

28:35.647 --> 28:38.371
That's true. I didn't. Thank you.

28:38.406 --> 28:41.371
Ooh! This is our stop.

28:42.675 --> 28:44.980
Now we run to the top of the hill.

28:45.015 --> 28:46.878
- That hill?
- Yeah.

28:47.491 --> 28:50.267
I thought you made All-State.

28:50.302 --> 28:52.549
Okay, it's been 24 minutes and 10 seconds.

28:53.209 --> 28:54.356
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

28:54.936 --> 28:56.002
That was some hill.

28:56.037 --> 28:57.841
It didn't look that steep from the bottom.

28:57.876 --> 28:59.703
- You want to stop?
- No.

29:01.955 --> 29:03.997
I don't think McDowell took an elevator.

29:04.032 --> 29:06.852
He wouldn't want to be seen, right?

29:08.801 --> 29:11.187
Just one more flight!

29:11.222 --> 29:14.187
Okay. One more flight.

29:15.122 --> 29:18.362
Why would someone choose
to live on the 21 st floor?

29:25.283 --> 29:27.233
- Are you all right?
- I'm good.

29:28.278 --> 29:30.705
Your eyes are crossed.

29:30.740 --> 29:32.922
- They're okay now.
- Let's go.

29:34.720 --> 29:36.111
You don't think he knocked?

29:36.146 --> 29:38.968
No. He had his own key to let himself in.

29:39.003 --> 29:41.458
Okay, okay, you're Gwen.

29:41.493 --> 29:44.699
The TVwas on, so she's probably
sitting here, doing her nails.

29:44.994 --> 29:47.961
I'm the killer. I let myself in.

29:47.996 --> 29:50.023
I let myself in.

29:52.395 --> 29:53.739
He sat on the couch?

29:53.774 --> 29:56.739
I can do it from here.

29:56.838 --> 29:58.982
Okay, okay.

30:00.066 --> 30:02.922
She hears him, she turns around.

30:02.957 --> 30:05.486
You're Gwen! She turns
around! She turns...

30:05.521 --> 30:08.486
Okay. "Trevor, I thought you
were running the marathon."

30:08.605 --> 30:10.629
They struggle. Struggle, struggle.

30:10.664 --> 30:11.961
He strangles her.

30:11.996 --> 30:14.018
Drags her off to the balcony.

30:14.053 --> 30:16.122
Go.! Come on.! He's in a hurry.! Go.!

30:16.157 --> 30:17.716
Okay, over she goes.

30:17.751 --> 30:20.308
What's the time?

30:20.343 --> 30:21.334
Thirty-nine minutes.

30:21.369 --> 30:22.604
Thirty-nine minutes.

30:22.639 --> 30:25.604
Okay, let's go.

30:26.627 --> 30:27.895
What are you doing?

30:27.930 --> 30:30.895
Uh, I think he took a nap.

30:31.177 --> 30:34.177
Yeah, you wish.

30:34.931 --> 30:36.138
Oh, my God.

30:36.173 --> 30:39.581
I love this chair. It vibrates.

30:39.836 --> 30:43.199
Sharona, we are not here to
shop. This is our primary suspect.

30:43.608 --> 30:46.381
Well, maybe we can get a
primary suspect discount.

30:46.416 --> 30:47.467
Well, well, well.!

30:47.502 --> 30:50.585
If it isn't Mr. Monk
and Sharona, am I right?

30:51.431 --> 30:52.432
What can I do for you?

30:52.467 --> 30:53.520
Do you have a minute, sir?

30:53.555 --> 30:54.625
I have all the time in the world.

30:54.660 --> 30:57.625
There's a sale on all the convertible
sofas if you're interested.

30:58.094 --> 30:59.567
- No, thanks.
- I'll make you a great deal.

30:59.602 --> 31:00.710
Free home delivery.

31:00.745 --> 31:02.570
We're not here to shop.

31:02.605 --> 31:04.370
Although, if it turns out you're innocent,

31:04.405 --> 31:07.420
I'd like to talk to
you about that recliner.

31:07.456 --> 31:09.012
Sharona.

31:09.047 --> 31:11.771
Um... Do you know Tonday Mawwaka?

31:11.806 --> 31:13.460
I know ofhim. I've never met him.

31:13.495 --> 31:16.131
I believe he was running
behind me for most of the race.

31:16.166 --> 31:17.782
We checked the records.

31:17.817 --> 31:20.249
You never turned in your computer chip.

31:20.284 --> 31:21.761
I forgot.

31:21.796 --> 31:24.007
And then later I misplaced it.

31:24.042 --> 31:25.534
You're crooked.

31:25.569 --> 31:28.534
I beg your pardon?

31:32.175 --> 31:34.754
Show him the picture.

31:34.789 --> 31:37.754
Is that you at the finish line?

31:38.098 --> 31:39.744
Yes.

31:39.779 --> 31:42.235
You ran 26 miles, and you're not sweating?

31:42.712 --> 31:43.757
I don't sweat that much.

31:43.792 --> 31:45.352
You know, some runners don't sweat at all.

31:45.387 --> 31:46.461
Is that everything?

31:46.496 --> 31:48.987
But here's what's been bothering me.

31:49.022 --> 31:51.862
This is you around mile five.

31:51.897 --> 31:53.783
Look at your shirt.

31:53.818 --> 31:56.414
It's completely drenched.

31:56.449 --> 31:58.822
Here's what happened.

31:58.857 --> 32:00.886
You had a problem.

32:00.921 --> 32:03.330
Her name was Gwen Zaleski.

32:03.365 --> 32:06.330
She didn't want to break it off.

32:07.040 --> 32:10.522
Maybe she threatened to
tell your wife everything...

32:12.421 --> 32:16.618
and ruin your perfect little world.

32:18.821 --> 32:21.699
So you disposed of her.

32:21.734 --> 32:24.529
You tossed her off the
balcony like a bag of garbage.

32:24.926 --> 32:27.315
Mr. Monk, I love my family.

32:27.350 --> 32:29.601
They're my life.

32:29.636 --> 32:32.532
Do you think I'm gonna
let somebody like you

32:32.567 --> 32:35.449
or anybody else take that away from me?

32:35.484 --> 32:38.064
So, true or false, Mr. Monk?

32:38.099 --> 32:39.270
According to the computer,

32:39.305 --> 32:43.119
I ran that entire race
from start to finish.

32:43.880 --> 32:46.880
True or false?

32:48.952 --> 32:50.545
True.

32:52.352 --> 32:55.352
Trevor, it's your wife, line two.

32:57.101 --> 33:00.101
It's your wife, Trevor.

33:00.589 --> 33:02.117
Line two.

33:14.789 --> 33:16.750
The Zaleski alibi checks out.

33:16.785 --> 33:19.396
He was in bed making a phone
call at the exact time of death.

33:19.431 --> 33:22.272
Yeah, It's not the ex-husband.

33:22.307 --> 33:25.272
No, sir. So, uh,

33:25.493 --> 33:26.582
where does that leave us?

33:26.617 --> 33:28.276
It leaves us with McDowell.

33:28.311 --> 33:29.822
- The boyfriend?
- Yeah.

33:29.857 --> 33:32.822
He checked out. He ran the whole race.

33:33.635 --> 33:37.971
Okay, let's say that McDowell did
pass the chip off to another runner.

33:38.387 --> 33:40.913
- That was your idea, sir.
- You're damn right it was.

33:42.365 --> 33:43.597
You're thinking Tonday.

33:43.632 --> 33:45.981
No, no. Their times
don't match up exactly.

33:46.722 --> 33:47.869
Well, then who?

33:47.904 --> 33:50.869
All right. Here's my idea.

33:51.416 --> 33:53.164
Let's say there were six runners.

33:53.199 --> 33:56.164
- Six?
- Yeah. Tonday, McDowell,

33:56.183 --> 33:58.977
and these four guys: Harvester,
Blanchard, Crowe and Davidson.

33:59.657 --> 34:01.658
They pass the chip back
and forth among them.

34:01.693 --> 34:03.798
They were all running
in the vicinity and...

34:03.833 --> 34:06.310
- Like a conspiracy.
- Well, no.

34:06.544 --> 34:08.788
I've worked the time out on this graph.

34:09.650 --> 34:11.306
Passing it back and forth,

34:11.342 --> 34:13.895
the time works out almost exactly.

34:13.929 --> 34:15.612
What do you think?

34:15.647 --> 34:17.045
Yeah, this is worth looking into, sir.

34:17.080 --> 34:18.882
It's all...

34:19.620 --> 34:21.156
No, it's not. It's insane.

34:21.190 --> 34:24.120
There is absolutely no
connection between those six men.

34:27.045 --> 34:29.561
Yeah, you're right. It's...

34:29.596 --> 34:32.561
I was just playing devil's
advocate with that. Uh...

34:37.107 --> 34:38.643
There is something you
don't see every day.

34:38.678 --> 34:41.155
A runner in this race with four legs.

34:41.190 --> 34:43.284
- Hang on a second. Stop the tape.
- What?

34:43.320 --> 34:44.853
What's that right there?

34:44.888 --> 34:47.853
Go back a little.

34:49.012 --> 34:50.998
- Is that a dog?
- Yeah. It's a poodle.

34:51.475 --> 34:54.475
Maybe he put the chip in the dog collar.

34:57.544 --> 34:59.769
That's a little poodle.

34:59.804 --> 35:02.383
Can a little poodle run 26 miles?

35:02.418 --> 35:04.651
Maybe he drugged it.

35:04.686 --> 35:07.651
I mean, if it's on drugs, yeah.

35:08.121 --> 35:09.992
I can call a vet.

35:10.027 --> 35:11.509
And, of course, our
cameras will be there at

35:11.510 --> 35:12.992
the finish line and
our microphones as well.

35:13.515 --> 35:15.699
We'll have interviews with the
winners, the lead runners...

35:15.734 --> 35:18.603
and also coverage of the
presentation of the trophy.

35:18.895 --> 35:20.247
And here comes the group that everybody's

35:20.248 --> 35:21.895
waiting for as they run
through the Castro area.

35:22.419 --> 35:25.419
Once again, huge applause for
the ageless Tonday Mawwaka,

35:25.462 --> 35:27.629
still running steady and
acknowledging the fans...

35:27.664 --> 35:30.629
and he's loving this, and why not?

35:31.424 --> 35:33.286
Let's get a shot now
from our motorcycle cam,

35:33.321 --> 35:35.068
just ahead ofTonday's group.

35:35.103 --> 35:36.585
And once again, of
course, Tonday has told us

35:36.586 --> 35:38.068
he's planning to call
it a career after this.

35:38.901 --> 35:40.802
But hey, he's said that before.

35:40.837 --> 35:43.802
And besides, there are various rumors...

35:54.670 --> 35:56.544
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

35:56.579 --> 35:58.686
What happened? You said it
was a matter of life or death.

35:58.721 --> 36:00.220
I know how he did it.

36:00.255 --> 36:01.999
What are you talking about?

36:02.034 --> 36:03.690
- Who?
- McDowell.

36:03.725 --> 36:05.325
I know how he killed her.

36:05.360 --> 36:06.943
I figured it out.

36:06.978 --> 36:08.436
You couldn't tell me over the phone?

36:08.471 --> 36:11.576
Well, I wanted to see your
face light up when I told ya.

36:13.560 --> 36:15.483
Okay, I'll take a rain check
on that lighting-up thing.

36:15.518 --> 36:18.265
Come on, let's go.

36:18.300 --> 36:20.722
And in other news, a
private memorial service...

36:20.757 --> 36:22.948
was held this morning for Gwen Zaleski,

36:22.983 --> 36:25.733
the young actress who
was slain this Sunday.

36:25.768 --> 36:28.560
A department spokesman said
they have a number of leads

36:28.595 --> 36:31.560
and expect to make an arrest...

36:32.949 --> 36:34.990
Cover the office for
me. I'll be right back.

36:36.099 --> 36:37.268
Take the next exit.

36:37.303 --> 36:38.659
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.

36:38.854 --> 36:41.346
Sharona, it was right in front of us.

36:41.381 --> 36:42.860
We were looking at it all wrong.

36:42.895 --> 36:44.329
We thought that Trevor McDowell

36:44.364 --> 36:46.412
gave his computer chip to another runner.

36:46.447 --> 36:47.053
Like Tonday.

36:47.088 --> 36:48.971
Like Tonday, but no other runner

36:49.006 --> 36:51.379
- had the exact same time, right?
- Right.

36:51.414 --> 36:54.769
I was just watching the tape again,
and I realized it wasn't another runner.

36:54.962 --> 36:58.376
There was somebody else who ran
that whole race from start to finish.

36:59.409 --> 37:00.389
Who?

37:00.424 --> 37:03.270
The TV camera bike.

37:03.305 --> 37:06.249
McDowell never even attached
the chip to his shoe.

37:06.284 --> 37:08.292
He stuck it somewhere on the vehicle.

37:08.327 --> 37:11.434
Maybe he taped it or used one of
those magnetic hide-a-key deals.

37:12.747 --> 37:15.483
McDowell started the
race like everybody else.

37:15.518 --> 37:18.483
He followed Tonday and
the bike for a few miles.

37:18.890 --> 37:20.727
Then, when he got to
the curve in the road,

37:20.762 --> 37:22.994
Trevor McDowell quit the race,

37:23.029 --> 37:25.202
but his computer chip continued on.

37:25.237 --> 37:27.571
It didn't miss a single checkpoint.

37:27.606 --> 37:30.104
He had a change of clothes
hidden in the bushes.

37:30.139 --> 37:31.617
Near the batch of camomile.

37:31.652 --> 37:32.868
Exactly.

37:32.903 --> 37:34.627
Then, after the murder,

37:34.662 --> 37:37.627
he reentered the race just before the end.

37:39.273 --> 37:41.520
The finish line was mass confusion.

37:41.555 --> 37:43.891
It was easy to rejoin the race.

37:43.926 --> 37:45.364
And that was it.

37:45.399 --> 37:46.818
He had an airtight alibi.

37:46.853 --> 37:48.049
It was the perfect crime.

37:48.084 --> 37:49.320
But what happened to the chip?

37:49.355 --> 37:50.733
I think it's still on the bike.

37:50.768 --> 37:52.735
There was no reason
for him to retrieve it.

37:52.770 --> 37:53.947
Nobody knew it was there.

37:53.982 --> 37:56.273
And even if they did find it,
they wouldn't know what it was.

37:57.096 --> 38:00.096
Here! Here we are.

38:02.926 --> 38:05.847
- Looks like all the vehicles
are parked back here. - Uh-huh.

38:17.733 --> 38:19.758
Oh, my God! There's McDowell!

38:19.793 --> 38:22.461
We gotta get to that chip before he does.

38:22.496 --> 38:23.683
- Ugh!
- What's wrong?

38:23.718 --> 38:26.419
- It's all rusty.
- Okay, okay. It's okay. I'll do it.

38:26.611 --> 38:27.659
- Give me a boost.
- What?

38:27.975 --> 38:29.183
Just put your hands like this.

38:29.218 --> 38:30.473
You're gonna step in my hand?

38:30.508 --> 38:31.966
That's how you give
somebody a boost. Come on.

38:32.001 --> 38:33.050
I don't think so.

38:33.085 --> 38:36.050
Adrian, that chip is the only thing
that connects him to the murder.

38:36.131 --> 38:38.376
If he finds it, he'll destroy
it and then we can't nail him.

38:38.411 --> 38:40.575
- Give me a boost!
- Let's just think.

38:40.747 --> 38:42.898
Maybe we could build a little ladder.

38:42.933 --> 38:43.903
Out of what?

38:43.938 --> 38:46.903
You know, branches and rocks.

38:48.907 --> 38:50.703
He found it! He found the chip!

38:50.738 --> 38:51.691
Will you give me the boost?

38:51.726 --> 38:53.279
- Hurry up! Hurry up!
- All right, all right.

38:53.314 --> 38:54.746
- Come on!
- Not that...Not that foot?

38:54.781 --> 38:57.746
- Why? - The other foot. You
stepped in something with that one.

38:57.982 --> 39:00.982
Now go. Go!

39:01.555 --> 39:05.817
- You got it?
- Wait, wait. Okay. Okay. L...

39:06.720 --> 39:08.193
Wait, wait, wait!

39:08.228 --> 39:08.954
What?

39:08.989 --> 39:10.477
- He saw us!
- McDowell!

39:13.131 --> 39:14.628
- Adrian, run.!
- What?

39:14.663 --> 39:17.488
Adrian, Run after him!
You're faster! You can do it!

39:17.523 --> 39:20.324
Go, Adrian!

39:20.359 --> 39:23.324
He's heading for the beach.!

39:33.523 --> 39:36.523
McDowell!

40:14.656 --> 40:16.414
Did you see that?

40:16.449 --> 40:17.705
Did you see that?

40:17.740 --> 40:20.115
He had about 40 yards on me!

40:20.150 --> 40:22.076
I know. Look behind you!

40:22.111 --> 40:23.072
What?

40:23.107 --> 40:25.299
Look behind you!

40:29.735 --> 40:32.735
There goes your evidence, Monk.!

40:49.646 --> 40:51.201
Officer, wait a minute.
Do you know who I am?

40:51.236 --> 40:54.201
Yes, sir. You sold me
a dinette set last year.

40:54.381 --> 40:57.381
- Oh.
- Watch your head.

40:58.669 --> 41:02.068
Trev, you might want to make a
note in case it ever comes up again:

41:02.852 --> 41:05.852
These new plastic hide-a-keys,
turns out they don't sink.

41:06.674 --> 41:09.105
Yeah, they float.

41:16.598 --> 41:19.487
- Tonday.!
- Hey.!

41:19.522 --> 41:20.569
You shouldn't have done this.

41:20.604 --> 41:23.022
I mean, I could have taken
a taxi to the airport.

41:23.057 --> 41:24.332
It's no problem.

41:24.367 --> 41:27.332
- We wanted to say
good-bye. - Uh-huh.

41:28.649 --> 41:30.741
- That right?
- Oh, close.

41:30.776 --> 41:33.089
Adrian, did you solve your case?

41:33.124 --> 41:34.822
Ah! I knew you would.

41:34.857 --> 41:36.459
I remember thinking,

41:36.494 --> 41:39.699
"This man is stronger
than he thinks he is.

41:40.073 --> 41:41.831
You know, he can run the race!"

41:41.866 --> 41:43.607
Here, I've got something for you.

41:43.642 --> 41:46.402
Tonday, I can't accept anything else.

41:46.437 --> 41:47.933
After we met,

41:47.968 --> 41:49.751
I had them send it to me.

41:49.786 --> 41:51.852
It's the...

41:51.887 --> 41:54.992
It's the headband you
wore in Los Angeles, 1973.

41:55.408 --> 41:58.408
Adrian, I can tell you're
searching for something.

41:59.158 --> 42:02.119
Life is a long and difficult race.

42:02.812 --> 42:06.031
You must hang on, hold on to it.

42:06.699 --> 42:09.822
Amandla. Amandla.

42:10.281 --> 42:12.258
That means "courage."

42:12.293 --> 42:14.910
Thank you, my friend.

42:14.945 --> 42:17.013
Thank you for this.

42:17.048 --> 42:18.543
This means the world to me.

42:18.578 --> 42:21.201
I haven't worn it since the big race,

42:21.236 --> 42:24.201
or washed it.

42:27.816 --> 42:30.021
Baggie. Baggie. Baggie. Baggie.

42:31.087 --> 42:32.461
Just give it to me.

42:32.496 --> 42:34.680
But be careful with it.
Don't wrinkle it, all right?

42:34.715 --> 42:35.591
Don't even look at it.

42:35.626 --> 42:38.110
You can... You can glance
at it, but don't stare.

42:39.216 --> 42:41.479
It's just a sweaty piece of cotton.

42:41.514 --> 42:44.337
Hey! What are you... Don't...
You're crushing it now.

42:44.372 --> 42:45.931
Just give it back to me. Here.

42:45.966 --> 42:48.035
Just go in the car.

42:48.070 --> 42:51.035
Go in the car.

42:51.232 --> 42:54.232
Think it could be dry-cleaned?

42:55.085 --> 42:58.085
Courage. Yeah.
