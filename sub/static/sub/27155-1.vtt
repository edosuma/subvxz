00:41.800 --> 00:42.700
Amazing

00:42.800 --> 00:45.800
I blinked in a blink of an eye.

00:45.800 --> 00:47.800
It's flying so high...

00:47.800 --> 00:50.800
Ah, give me a look.

00:50.800 --> 00:51.800
I want to see too

00:53.800 --> 00:56.800
This drone can fly for 30 minutes at an altitude of 1000 meters.

00:58.800 --> 01:00.800
This can be called the world record of drones.

01:01.800 --> 01:05.800
That being said, how you can control it at such a high height?

01:05.900 --> 01:08.800
By using satellite communications

01:08.800 --> 01:12.800
So you can operate it, even if you are far away.

01:13.800 --> 01:19.800
Although the imagery was passed from the body camera,
you still need to control the latitude, longitude

01:19.800 --> 01:23.800
both direction stick, speed, and other information to operate the flight.

01:23.800 --> 01:25.800
it's still very difficult.

01:25.800 --> 01:28.800
But why do you want to fly this drone?

01:28.800 --> 01:30.800
You said why?

01:30.800 --> 01:32.800
That is of course the romance of a man.

01:35.800 --> 01:38.800
As long as you have this, even if you don’t climb the Mount Everest

01:38.800 --> 01:40.800
Feels like that I've boarded it, right?

01:43.800 --> 01:44.800
What a creepy laugh.

01:46.800 --> 01:49.800
I'm sure that would broke many laws at the future.

01:50.800 --> 01:55.800
CM here, we will send you the latest information of the upcoming Tokyo Summit for next week.

01:57.800 --> 01:59.800
The summit will be held here!

01:59.800 --> 02:02.800
A comprehensive resort built on the artificial land of Tokyo Bay

02:02.800 --> 02:06.800
[EDGE OF OCEAN] International Conference Hall!

02:06.800 --> 02:09.800
[EDGE OF OCEAN] which was scheduled to open next month..

02:09.800 --> 02:11.800
Defined by the coastal city

02:11.800 --> 02:16.800
Consisting of a variety of facilities that are designed to flow into the stream

02:16.800 --> 02:19.800
Casino Tower built on the shell

02:20.800 --> 02:23.800
It will also serve as a lighthouse to held the responsibility of ensuring the safety of the sea.

02:23.800 --> 02:26.800
From the casino tower, you can see the whole picture of [EDGE OF OCEAN],

02:26.800 --> 02:29.800
The shopping center on the side of the tower,

02:29.800 --> 02:32.800
has setting up views such as waterfall and large aerial garden,

02:32.800 --> 02:35.800
Bringing a calm feeling to the visitors.

02:37.800 --> 02:40.600
Another design concept for the resort are

02:40.600 --> 02:45.800
the interior decoration of the international conference hall will draw the beauty of the Japanese garden.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.800
there is also a stylish restaurant on the first floor.

02:50.800 --> 02:52.800
Next, please look at here.

02:52.800 --> 02:54.800
Surrounded by the periphery of the resort

02:54.800 --> 02:56.500
Monorail with two layers above and below

02:56.800 --> 02:58.800
Truly blending the tradition with the future

02:58.800 --> 03:01.800
The sense of wisdom and the city is vividly displayed.

03:02.800 --> 03:04.800
As you can see, [EDGE OF OCEAN]

03:04.800 --> 03:06.800
is connected by two bridges.

03:06.800 --> 03:11.800
The Metropolitan Police Department [MPD], who was responsible for the security mission

03:11.800 --> 03:16.800
of the summit on May 1, will invest up to 22,000 people to maintain security.

03:17.800 --> 03:21.300
Next, the news information of the unmanned spacecraft [WHITE SWAN].

04:45.800 --> 04:50.800
<font color="#FDBB4B">Detective Conan [ZERO THE ENFORCER]</font>

04:45.800 --> 04:50.100
Translated by [Banana-Turtle]

04:53.200 --> 04:55.800
I'm a high school detective, Shinichi Kudo!

04:55.800 --> 04:59.800
When I went to the amusement park with my childhood friend, Ran Mouri,

04:59.800 --> 05:03.800
I witnessed a men in black in a suspicious deal transaction.

05:04.800 --> 05:06.800
While I was focusing with the deal,

05:06.800 --> 05:10.800
I was unaware that another men in black's companion has approached me from behind.

05:12.800 --> 05:16.800
I was poisoned by that man.

05:16.800 --> 05:17.800
When I wake up...

05:21.800 --> 05:23.800
My body has shrunk!

05:24.800 --> 05:27.800
If those guys find that Shinichi Kudo is still alive

05:27.800 --> 05:29.800
I will be stared again at my life

05:29.800 --> 05:31.800
And endanger people around me as well.

05:31.800 --> 05:34.800
So I listened to Dr. Agasa suggestion.

05:34.800 --> 05:35.800
Concealing my real identity

05:35.800 --> 05:37.800
When Ran asked my name,

05:37.800 --> 05:39.800
At instant, I said my name is

05:39.800 --> 05:41.800
Conan Edogawa.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.800
In order to collect any information from those men in black

05:43.800 --> 05:46.800
I will live at Ran's house, whose father is a detective.

05:50.800 --> 05:53.800
This is Genta, Mitsuhiko, and Ayumi.

05:53.800 --> 05:55.800
They are my current classmate after my body get shrunked.

05:55.800 --> 05:57.800
This is Ai Haibara.

05:57.800 --> 05:59.800
Real name : [Shiho Miyano]

06:00.800 --> 06:03.500
She was the one who developed the poison "APTX4869" that I drank.

06:03.500 --> 06:05.800
A junk that rebelled against the organization. 

06:05.800 --> 06:07.900
when she drank the medicine to commit suicide,

06:07.900 --> 06:10.800
her body also got shrunken.

06:11.800 --> 06:12.600
In addition,

06:12.600 --> 06:14.800
A member of the black organization that was hiding in the mist,

06:14.800 --> 06:16.200
CODENAME : [ BOURBON ]

06:16.200 --> 06:17.800
Toru Amuro

06:17.800 --> 06:20.800
His true identity is an undercover police officer of,

06:20.800 --> 06:23.300
the national police agency - public security bureau [NPA-PSB]

06:23.300 --> 06:25.800
code name: [ZERO]

06:26.200 --> 06:27.900
He's currently being uncle Mouri’s student

06:27.900 --> 06:29.800
and working at the "Poirot Cafe".

06:29.800 --> 06:31.800
Using this as his camouflage.

06:31.800 --> 06:33.800
He is a very mysterious man.

06:36.800 --> 06:39.800
Even this body got shrunken but the mind is still flexible.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.800
I'm the unbeatable detective!

06:42.800 --> 06:46.800
There is always only one truth!

06:51.800 --> 06:56.800
After performing the task of sampling at Mars, unmanned spacecraft "[WHITE SWAN]",

06:56.800 --> 06:59.800
will return to Earth on May 1st, Japan time.

07:00.800 --> 07:05.800
It will separate the capsule with the main body during regression,

07:05.800 --> 07:10.800
and about four meters of the space capsule will return into the atmosphere.

07:10.800 --> 07:13.800
After entering the atmosphere, capsule's parachute will be opened,

07:13.800 --> 07:15.700
and was expected to land in the coast of Japan,

07:15.700 --> 07:17.900
while the main body will be burned out.

07:18.900 --> 07:24.800
A precision induction system equipped with GPS is installed in the sample compartment.

07:24.800 --> 07:29.800
It can control the landing point within a radius of 200 meters.

07:31.800 --> 07:33.800
Let me fly it too.

07:33.800 --> 07:34.800
I want to fly it too.

07:40.800 --> 07:46.800
Should I just cut the remote control into three separate parts? such directions, speed and camera?

07:48.500 --> 07:50.800
Sorry, the show has to be interupted.

07:51.800 --> 07:52.800
Breaking news!

07:52.800 --> 07:57.800
[A large-scale explosion just happened in the international conference venue of the Tokyo Summit next week.]

07:58.800 --> 08:01.300
[Please watch the video taken by the surveillance camera at that time.]

08:07.800 --> 08:08.800
This is...

08:09.800 --> 08:14.800
[The integrated resort [EDGE OF OCEAN], which is located at the scene of the explosion, has not yet opened.]

08:14.800 --> 08:16.800
doctor!

08:16.800 --> 08:19.800
No guest access at the scene

08:19.810 --> 08:24.200
However, there is a message that the safety of the summit has being checked in advance.

08:24.200 --> 08:26.000
[I will repeat it again, just now....]

08:26.000 --> 08:27.800
Maybe it’s a terrorist attack

08:27.800 --> 08:28.700
[According to the info]

08:28.700 --> 08:30.200
But isn’t the summit next week?

08:30.200 --> 08:31.100
Probably an accident.

08:31.100 --> 08:35.799
[released by the [MPD], the number of police officers killed and injured right now..]

08:35.799 --> 08:37.799
[and whether the explosion was an accident or incident,]

08:37.799 --> 08:39.799
[currently under investigation.]

08:39.799 --> 08:42.799
There are police officers killed and injured? it’s really worrying

08:43.799 --> 08:44.800
doctor! 

08:44.800 --> 08:45.800
The display is gone!

08:45.800 --> 08:47.800
Oh, I am coming.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.800
Well

08:49.800 --> 08:52.800
if you strike a terrorist attack before the summit.

08:52.800 --> 08:55.100
The security at the official summit will be more rigorous.

08:56.800 --> 08:57.800
what is it?

08:57.800 --> 09:01.800
surveillance camera after the explosion

09:02.800 --> 09:04.800
What did you see?

09:05.800 --> 09:09.800
Only for a moment, maybe I was wrong.

09:10.300 --> 09:11.800
That man..

09:11.800 --> 09:13.500
worker at the Poirot Cafe.

09:17.800 --> 09:21.800
I remember.. his name is.. Toru Amuro?

09:21.800 --> 09:22.800
Mr. Amuro?

09:24.800 --> 09:28.800
According to the identification results, no explosives were found on the spot.

09:29.800 --> 09:33.800
There is a japanese kiosk on the 1st floor of the international conference hall,

09:33.800 --> 09:37.500
the kitchen on the ground floor of the kiosk were the scene of the explosion.

09:37.500 --> 09:39.800
From there, a lot of gas is detected

09:39.800 --> 09:43.800
According to this, I think it should be judged that it is a gas explosion.

09:43.800 --> 09:44.800
Gas? that’s accident.

09:44.800 --> 09:45.800
Wait

09:45.800 --> 09:47.800
That building has just been established.

09:47.800 --> 09:50.800
It's hard to imagine a gas leak.

09:50.800 --> 09:53.800
In fact, this gas pipe is the latest type.

09:53.800 --> 09:57.800
Gas valves switch can only be accessed through the internet network.

09:57.800 --> 10:00.800
So why is there a gas leak?

10:00.800 --> 10:04.800
This system is likely to be faulty from the beginning.

10:04.800 --> 10:06.800
Haven't you checked it?

10:06.800 --> 10:09.800
Originally scheduled to be checked today.

10:09.800 --> 10:11.100
what actually happened?

10:11.100 --> 10:13.400
[EDGE OF OCEAN]'s internet network

10:13.400 --> 10:15.500
just have been activated today.

10:15.500 --> 10:16.800
And the security inspection

10:16.800 --> 10:19.500
by the Public Security Bureau [PSB], also had been

10:19.500 --> 10:21.500
carried out earlier this morning.

10:21.500 --> 10:25.800
Then in this case, it's very likely to be accident.

10:26.300 --> 10:29.200
Summit dignitaries will meet at the next week, .

10:29.200 --> 10:31.200
If this is a terrorist attack,

10:31.200 --> 10:34.800
doesn't make sense to be executed at that time.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.800
About the venue of the summit

10:36.800 --> 10:40.800
Following to this event, they have decided to change the location.

10:43.800 --> 10:45.800
report

10:45.800 --> 10:47.800
name and department?

10:47.800 --> 10:50.800
Public Security Bureau [PSB], Yuya Kazami.

10:51.800 --> 10:53.200
About the ignition of the gas explosion...

10:53.200 --> 10:54.800
what is it?

10:54.800 --> 10:56.800
The criminal department is investigating the electrical installations

10:56.800 --> 10:58.800
It's been 8 months,

10:59.800 --> 11:02.800
but it might be a high voltage cable.

11:02.800 --> 11:04.800
Did you find any omissions in the project?

11:04.800 --> 11:05.800
No

11:05.800 --> 11:11.800
However, we found a burnt fingerprint on the door of the high voltage cable box.

11:11.800 --> 11:15.200
you mean there's a fingerprint that was stained before the explosion occurred?

11:15.200 --> 11:15.800
Yes

11:15.800 --> 11:19.800
Only engineering personnel and our mens from [PSB]

11:19.800 --> 11:21.800
who have entered the site,

11:22.800 --> 11:24.800
Then the burnt fingerprints was compared

11:24.800 --> 11:29.800
with the database between engineering personnel and our police officers.

11:29.800 --> 11:37.800
Found to be consistent with the fingerprint of Kogoro Mouri, who was once worked in the Metropolitan Police Department [MPD].

11:37.800 --> 11:38.800
Huh?

11:41.800 --> 11:43.800
How can this be?

11:49.800 --> 11:53.800
I've never been to an international conference venue on artificial land!

11:54.800 --> 11:57.800
However, the fingerprint of Mr. Mouri was found on the spot.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.800
How is that possible?

12:00.800 --> 12:05.800
Dad, are you drunk and sneaking in?

12:05.800 --> 12:09.800
Didn't I say that? I've never been to that place.

12:09.800 --> 12:10.800
It must be wrong.

12:10.800 --> 12:12.800
Even if you check it again, it will take a lot of work.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.800
Noted that down

12:19.800 --> 12:20.800
Excuse me.

12:25.800 --> 12:28.800
Conan kun, what happened?

12:28.800 --> 12:32.800
That Mr. Officer is hurt on the face. Doesn't it matter?

12:32.800 --> 12:34.800
Ah, Mr. Kazami?

12:34.800 --> 12:37.800
He seems to be at the scene when the explosion happened.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.800
Ah wait, I will go to the bathroom.

12:54.800 --> 13:01.800
Oh, what's wrong, um, oh, your father was suspected by the police?

13:03.800 --> 13:07.800
Um, I think it's not right.

13:07.800 --> 13:10.800
I know, I will also check it.

13:15.800 --> 13:18.800
what? my phone?

13:25.800 --> 13:26.800
Ah, doctor..

13:27.800 --> 13:30.800
Shinichi? What is it?

13:30.800 --> 13:32.800
I need your help.

13:34.800 --> 13:37.800
When are you going to make trouble with these guys?

13:37.800 --> 13:38.800
Sorry, I can't help.

13:38.800 --> 13:39.800
Takagi?!

13:47.800 --> 13:48.800
My phone..

13:56.800 --> 13:59.800
It’s so funny.

13:59.800 --> 14:04.800
Ah, Genta, the speed is slower.

14:04.800 --> 14:05.800
People are shooting

14:05.800 --> 14:12.800
But it’s amazing, I can fly so far.

14:12.800 --> 14:15.800
It can be operated within 30 kilometers.

14:15.800 --> 14:19.800
Ah, we just flew over twenty kilometers.

14:21.800 --> 14:24.800
I have already sent something to my old lady living in Saitama.

14:24.800 --> 14:27.800
Grandma is super happy

14:27.800 --> 14:29.800
What time?

14:30.800 --> 14:34.800
But the display is too small. Don’t you think it looks a bit uncomfortable?

14:34.800 --> 14:40.800
Um, because I didn’t intend to divide it into three controller.

14:40.800 --> 14:44.800
doctor, put display on my remote control too.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.800
Ayumi's too.

14:46.800 --> 14:49.800
Uh, I wonder how?

14:49.800 --> 14:52.800
Ok, let’s play quiz.

14:52.800 --> 14:55.800
Listen, if you guess the quiz correctly,

14:55.800 --> 14:57.800
I will install a display for each remote control.

14:57.800 --> 14:58.800
Huh?

14:58.800 --> 15:03.800
Then the problem is coming in the line of hiragana

15:03.800 --> 15:07.800
Which of the following is the biggest one?

15:07.800 --> 15:13.800
The first one (A-GIO), the second (KA-GIO), the third (SA-GIO), the fourth (TA-GIO)

15:13.800 --> 15:15.800
What is that mean?

15:15.800 --> 15:19.800
Which one is the biggest one??

15:19.800 --> 15:21.800
Which is the biggest one in Hiragana?

15:21.800 --> 15:23.800
A-GIO "あいうえお" (A I U E O)

15:23.800 --> 15:26.200
KA-GIO " かきくけこ’ " ( KA KI KU KE KO )

15:26.200 --> 15:27.800
and so the rest...

15:27.800 --> 15:29.300
(SA SI SU SE SO) さしすせそ...

15:29.600 --> 15:31.800
(TA CHI SU TE CHO) たちつてと...

15:31.800 --> 15:33.800
Huh, I don’t understand!!

15:33.800 --> 15:34.500
Wow wait!

15:34.500 --> 15:36.500
Ayumi, don’t spin the camera!

15:38.800 --> 15:41.800
Then a hint: ‘[WHITE SWAN]’

15:41.800 --> 15:42.800
[WHITE SWAN]???

15:42.800 --> 15:44.800
Wait, Ai..

15:44.800 --> 15:46.500
Speaking of the [WHITE SWAN].. 

15:46.500 --> 15:48.800
the lake of [WHITE SWAN]s..

15:48.800 --> 15:51.200
Ah! It’s the meaning of a big lake!!

15:51.200 --> 15:53.300
MI-GIO ‘み行’! ! For みずうみ " ( LAKE )! 

15:53.300 --> 15:54.800
Huh is there it??

15:54.800 --> 15:57.800
Hint 2: Return of the [WHITE SWAN].

15:57.800 --> 15:59.800
The [WHITE SWAN]s are going home "おうち" (House)

15:59.800 --> 16:02.800
Ah!! [WHITE SWAN] is going home to the lake!!

16:02.800 --> 16:06.800
Go home (おうち)... go home... home (うち)

16:06.800 --> 16:12.800
I know! The unmanned spacecraft ‘[WHITE SWAN]’ is coming back from the universe!

16:13.800 --> 16:14.800
So the correct answer is?

16:15.800 --> 16:17.800
It's the first (Agio) !!

16:17.800 --> 16:20.800
In vowel A-I-U-E-O, " う (U) " in the middle..

16:20.800 --> 16:22.500
That is, " うちゅう " U for ( Universe )!

16:22.500 --> 16:25.800
Because the size of the Universe is bigger than anything!

16:25.800 --> 16:28.800
Yes, you answered very well.

16:28.800 --> 16:33.800
Really, Ai gave them too many hint!

16:34.800 --> 16:35.800
You know what, doctor...

16:36.800 --> 16:39.800
It’s dangerous to play quiz while manipulating the drone.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.800
And now everyone's answer is different from your quiz.

16:43.800 --> 16:45.500
It’s not a joke

16:45.500 --> 16:46.500
Sorry..

16:46.500 --> 16:49.100
Although our criminal investigation bureau [CIB],

16:49.100 --> 16:53.800
[PSB] and Security Bureau [SB] are responsible for on-site inspections,

16:53.800 --> 16:57.800
But the explosion happened at the [PSB]'s inspection shift time.

16:57.800 --> 17:01.100
so that's why Mr.Kazami was injured.

17:01.100 --> 17:04.800
He just slightly injured because he was on the outside.

17:04.800 --> 17:07.099
Others was still in the building..

17:07.800 --> 17:10.800
I saw in the news that there are also dead casualties.

17:10.800 --> 17:11.800
Yes

17:12.599 --> 17:14.099
though this shouldn't be said,

17:14.099 --> 17:16.599
But the victims are only the police officers,

17:16.599 --> 17:18.599
not the public.

17:18.599 --> 17:22.200
A blessing in a misfortune.

17:22.200 --> 17:24.800
If an explosion occurs during the summit

17:24.800 --> 17:26.800
It’s going to cause a big riot around the world.

17:27.800 --> 17:32.800
The [MPD], especially the [PSB], has been subject to many criticisms.

17:32.800 --> 17:34.800
that's because of the explosion 'accident' before the summit

17:34.800 --> 17:36.800
so that's understandable.

17:36.800 --> 17:37.800
'Accident'?

17:37.800 --> 17:38.800
Oh no..

17:38.800 --> 17:40.800
According to the situation at the scene

17:40.800 --> 17:42.800
It should've been noted as an 'accident'.

17:42.800 --> 17:43.800
So..

17:43.800 --> 17:47.800
isn't the fingerprint of uncle Kogoro was found at the scene?

17:48.800 --> 17:50.800
That is what Mr. Kazami said

17:50.800 --> 17:52.800
He suddenly raised that possibility..

17:52.800 --> 17:54.800
Mr. Kazami..

17:57.800 --> 17:59.800
Thank you, Officer Takagi!

17:59.800 --> 18:00.800
Goodbye.

18:01.800 --> 18:03.800
Be careful on your way home!

18:04.800 --> 18:05.800
Ran, what happened?

18:06.800 --> 18:07.800
Shinichi, help me.

18:07.800 --> 18:10.800
Dad is going to be arrested.

18:14.800 --> 18:15.800
I said, I don't know.

18:16.800 --> 18:22.800
We found the schedule of the summit you collected from your computer.

18:22.800 --> 18:27.800
there is also an architectural blueprint of the international conference ground that was blown up.

18:27.800 --> 18:32.800
there's no way dad would keep that kind of information on his computer!

18:32.800 --> 18:34.200
that's true!

18:34.200 --> 18:35.900
because dad is a computer blind.

18:35.900 --> 18:37.800
that's right, impossible!

18:37.800 --> 18:40.800
To make it short, let us take you to the police station.

18:40.800 --> 18:41.800
Are you kidding me?

18:41.800 --> 18:43.800
I will not assist the police investigation.

18:45.800 --> 18:49.800
Hence, the arrest orders will be executed as a denial to cooperate and resisting an officer.

18:49.800 --> 18:52.800
I just waving your hand, wait! wait!

18:54.800 --> 18:55.800
Dad! Uncle!

18:55.800 --> 18:58.800
April 28, 4:56 pm

18:59.800 --> 19:01.800
Hey! let me go!

19:02.800 --> 19:06.800
Your resistance will only increase your suspicion.

19:06.800 --> 19:07.800
Wait!!

19:07.800 --> 19:09.800
If uncle Kogoro is a suspect,

19:09.800 --> 19:12.800
What is the motivation for the explosion of the summit venue?

19:12.800 --> 19:14.800
Yes! what is my motivation?

19:14.800 --> 19:17.800
This question will be clarified when making a transcript.

19:20.800 --> 19:21.800
calm down!

19:21.800 --> 19:22.800
contact Kudo immediately..

19:22.800 --> 19:25.800
I already did..!

19:25.800 --> 19:27.800
I did...

19:28.800 --> 19:29.800
How..

19:30.800 --> 19:33.800
How could that guy is not here at this time...

19:58.800 --> 20:02.800
This is a police officer.

20:02.800 --> 20:04.800
Maybe, I don't know.

20:04.800 --> 20:09.800
How come Mr.Kazami and Mr.Amuro were both injured?

20:09.800 --> 20:12.700
Which mean, Mr. Amuro was there too,

20:12.700 --> 20:13.900
at the scene of the explosion..

20:13.900 --> 20:15.800
I don't understand what you were saying.

20:15.800 --> 20:18.800
You was there at the summit venue for the inspection?

20:19.800 --> 20:22.800
you must have noticed the possibility of a terrorist attack at that time..

20:23.400 --> 20:25.200
but you know that with the current investigation..

20:25.200 --> 20:27.800
the 'incident' will be treated only as an 'accident'.

20:27.800 --> 20:30.800
So you made a suspect, right?

20:31.800 --> 20:34.800
Like Mr. Amuro or a police officer like him

20:34.800 --> 20:36.800
Doing little tricks at the computer..

20:36.800 --> 20:39.800
Or even faked the fingerprints, it should've been easy..

20:39.800 --> 20:43.800
The police will not respond to any suspicions without evidence.

20:44.800 --> 20:46.800
Why did you do this?

20:49.800 --> 20:55.800
Because I have something to protect, to protect my life.

21:00.800 --> 21:04.800
This time, Mr. Amuro may be an enemy.

21:08.800 --> 21:11.800
Why mom? Why you don't defend dad as a lawyer?

21:11.800 --> 21:15.800
Do you really think that uncle has blown up the venue?

21:16.800 --> 21:18.800
That idiot couldn't do this kind of thing

21:18.800 --> 21:20.800
Then why?

21:22.800 --> 21:25.800
Lawyers are not defending relatives

21:26.800 --> 21:30.800
Because the judge will think that the lawyer’s defense lacks objectivity.

21:31.800 --> 21:34.800
That's why, if I come to defend that person,

21:34.800 --> 21:37.800
Instead, it will be a disadvantage for him.

21:37.800 --> 21:38.800
How could this be

21:39.800 --> 21:40.800
It's fine

21:40.800 --> 21:43.800
I will find a good lawyer soon.

21:45.800 --> 21:49.800
It’s a pity that things are the way as you think sir,

21:49.800 --> 21:54.800
if only we can find out this earlier, our police companions will not...

21:55.800 --> 21:56.800
Yes.

21:56.800 --> 21:59.800
I didn’t expect it to explode before the summit.

21:59.800 --> 22:02.800
Currently our [PSB] are listing and troubleshooting

22:02.800 --> 22:06.800
domestic radicals and international terrorist organizations that might be involved.

22:06.800 --> 22:08.700
Mr. Furuya over there...

22:09.700 --> 22:13.800
I'm investigating the communication that was accessed at the explosion site.

22:13.800 --> 22:16.800
It seems to use a very special system

22:16.800 --> 22:17.800
What is it?

22:17.800 --> 22:19.800
I still don't know but

22:19.800 --> 22:22.800
I will inform the [MPD] about all the investigation results of the [PSB].

22:22.800 --> 22:23.800
I understand.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.800
How's with the key?

22:25.800 --> 22:29.800
Yes, '2291' had been introduced.

22:33.800 --> 22:34.800
Mr. Furuya?

22:35.800 --> 22:36.800
Got it

22:48.800 --> 22:52.800
That means, from Kogoro Mouri's computer..

22:52.800 --> 22:56.800
access to the gas plugs connected to the site, was found?

22:56.800 --> 22:57.800
Yes

22:58.800 --> 23:01.800
It's a report that we received from the cybercrime dept.

23:01.800 --> 23:03.800
That it is..

23:03.800 --> 23:05.800
Kogoro Mouri sneaked in here

23:06.800 --> 23:07.800
Open this door

23:07.800 --> 23:09.800
let the high voltage cable leak out..

23:09.800 --> 23:10.800
Hold on a second!

23:10.800 --> 23:15.800
Then the surveillance cameras would have captured Mouri's face!

23:15.800 --> 23:16.200
Ah, NO..

23:16.200 --> 23:18.800
The network just activated yesterday.

23:18.800 --> 23:20.800
the cameras was off until then.

23:20.800 --> 23:21.600
damn it..

23:21.800 --> 23:24.800
What did he say when he's being interrogated?

23:24.800 --> 23:26.500
Kogoro Mouri has been denying

23:26.500 --> 23:29.500
But, even if he denies it, he can be sent for inspection.

23:29.500 --> 23:31.800
Even the motives are still unclear, you will still send him?

23:31.800 --> 23:34.800
The evidences are completed for inspection.

23:35.500 --> 23:38.500
This just an every day life of the police officers.

23:38.500 --> 23:41.800
Hold a sec! where's no motive, nothing was wrong!

23:45.800 --> 23:49.100
Do you think the inspectors are lying to you?

23:50.800 --> 23:52.800
Oh, I see...

23:52.800 --> 23:53.800
yeah..

23:57.800 --> 24:00.800
How come... why no one wants to defend?

24:00.800 --> 24:02.800
Is it a big case?

24:02.800 --> 24:03.800
Yes

24:03.800 --> 24:08.800
There is also a suspect who is defending a celebrity such as 'Sleeping Kogoro Mouri'

24:08.800 --> 24:11.800
No matter which lawyer will worry about it.

24:13.800 --> 24:14.800
Please enter

24:16.800 --> 24:17.800
excuse me

24:17.800 --> 24:18.800
Officer Shiratori

24:19.800 --> 24:22.800
I think it’s better to inform you before the reports.

24:22.800 --> 24:23.800
What happened?

24:24.800 --> 24:26.800
Mr. Mouri..

24:26.800 --> 24:28.800
he was sent for inspection.

24:29.800 --> 24:32.900
are there enough evidences for the inspection?

24:32.900 --> 24:37.800
Fingerprint of Mr. Mouri, architectural blueprint in his computer,

24:37.800 --> 24:42.800
and the summit schedule, plus the record of access to the firelighter...

24:42.800 --> 24:45.800
It's enough for the inspection..

24:45.800 --> 24:49.800
Why... Dad...

24:55.800 --> 24:59.800
Just wait Ran, I will definitely save the uncle.

25:03.800 --> 25:06.800
Did the doctor find it?

25:06.800 --> 25:08.800
Oh, you are here.

25:08.800 --> 25:09.800
Look

25:12.800 --> 25:15.800
... Indeed it looks a bit like a bomb.

25:15.800 --> 25:17.800
According to your commission, why don't we just use

25:17.800 --> 25:20.900
the drone to take pictures of those scattered fragments?

25:20.900 --> 25:24.800
to restore the images of these fragments together just like a puzzle.

25:26.800 --> 25:29.800
In order to determine the type of the bomb,

25:29.800 --> 25:34.800
Ai is comparing the images on the Internet

25:35.800 --> 25:38.800
Ok, I found something matched.

25:39.800 --> 25:40.800
Um, this is...

25:41.800 --> 25:42.800
I'm creating the details

25:47.800 --> 25:49.800
l.O.T rice cooker?

25:49.800 --> 25:53.800
The internet said this is I.O.T rice cooker can make any dishes like soup

25:53.800 --> 26:00.800
Just set the pressure, temperature, or the time to cook with your phone

26:00.800 --> 26:01.800
cook?

26:01.800 --> 26:08.800
In addition to the pressure, there are also scattered dishes such as pans, stockpots and cutlery.

26:08.800 --> 26:13.800
It seems that the explosion site is the kitchen of the restaurant in that facility.

26:13.800 --> 26:17.800
What the..!? It's not a bomb at all?

26:17.800 --> 26:18.800
Hey!

26:19.800 --> 26:22.800
Why are you complaining so hard?

26:22.800 --> 26:25.800
Don't you see Ai already tried to help you best?

26:25.800 --> 26:28.800
What's up? It’s not like a normal you.

26:30.800 --> 26:31.800
My bad...

26:32.800 --> 26:34.800
What is it? What happened?

26:35.800 --> 26:39.200
Uncle Mouri... he was sent for the inspection.

26:48.800 --> 26:49.800
Who is this?

26:50.800 --> 26:52.800
Hey, what are you talking about?

26:53.800 --> 26:58.800
In other words, please let me, Tachibana Kyouko, defend the ‘sleeping Kogoro Mouri.’

27:00.800 --> 27:03.800
This is the cases I have handled so far.

27:05.800 --> 27:10.800
‘Secondary College University’s Extraordinary Events’ and ‘Ministry of Industry’s Espionage’...

27:10.800 --> 27:13.800
There are many cases in public security.

27:13.800 --> 27:16.800
Ah, then it’s just the same case..

27:16.800 --> 27:20.800
So what is the outcome of my sister’s dad trial?

27:21.800 --> 27:24.800
Hey, little child, do you know a lot of difficult words?

27:24.800 --> 27:26.800
It's a lost

27:26.800 --> 27:28.800
Uh……

27:28.800 --> 27:32.800
Ah... but the public security incident is very difficult.

27:32.800 --> 27:33.800
Yes

27:33.800 --> 27:37.800
As you know, the prosecution’s case has a winning rate of more than 90%.

27:37.800 --> 27:41.800
And the public security incident is even higher than that.

27:41.800 --> 27:44.800
That's why it’s not impossible to win.

27:44.800 --> 27:45.800
But I am a ‘mobile lawyer’ so...

27:46.800 --> 27:47.800
Mobile lawyer?

27:47.800 --> 27:50.800
Means she wasn't subordinate to the firm

27:50.800 --> 27:52.800
A free lawyer who accept works via phone

27:52.800 --> 27:55.800
So even if it's an unfavorable trial, it must be answered.

27:55.800 --> 27:58.800
...so I have to accept my father’s defense.

27:58.800 --> 28:02.800
You are looking for a lawyer. I heard from the lawyers association.

28:02.800 --> 28:04.800
Please let me take the case.

28:04.800 --> 28:06.800
Hmm, well...

28:06.800 --> 28:08.800
Wait! wait a minute..

28:09.800 --> 28:14.800
No, mom.. this lawyer even doesn’t want to win at all.

28:14.800 --> 28:15.800
But this seemingly unreliable lawyer

28:16.800 --> 28:20.800
Maybe it will make the prosecutors underestimate the other side...

28:21.800 --> 28:25.800
Can we win like this? Or let the country to choose the defender?

28:25.800 --> 28:27.800
That's okay, doesn’t matter to me.

28:28.800 --> 28:31.800
But if it is this person, I can asked her freely

28:33.800 --> 28:37.800
but, it's still very uncomfortable.

28:42.800 --> 28:47.800
I heard that you have been denying your crimes. 
|[Prosecutor Makoto Kusakabe - 40 y.o.]|

28:48.800 --> 28:51.800
Of course it is! I didn't do anything.

28:52.800 --> 28:57.800
But there's so many evidences that can prove you are the suspect.

28:57.800 --> 29:00.200
How could I know all of this this, Mr. Prosecutor !? 

29:00.200 --> 29:02.800
Someone is clearly trying to trap me.

29:03.800 --> 29:10.800
These explosion incident was sent to the Prosecutor's Agency - Public Security Bureau [PA-PSB], Mr. Kusakabe.

29:10.800 --> 29:11.800
Huh? that's bad.

29:12.800 --> 29:17.800
Even if I rarely participated in the public security incident, I have heard his name.

29:17.800 --> 29:19.800
Is he such a powerful prosecutor?

29:20.800 --> 29:24.800
Like my master, he is a very talented prosecutor who has never lost.

29:25.800 --> 29:26.800
Contrary to me

29:29.800 --> 29:32.800
Ah, I know this case.

29:32.800 --> 29:34.800
‘[NAZU] invasion incident’

29:35.800 --> 29:38.900
Huh, [NAZU] is that U.S. company that worked for the development of the universe.

29:38.900 --> 29:40.800
It's very famous...

29:40.800 --> 29:45.800
Ah, last year, an employee of a game company raised an issue of the access violation by [NAZU].

29:45.800 --> 29:48.800
The prosecutor of that time was also Mr. Kusakabe

29:48.800 --> 29:49.800
That trial too..?

29:50.800 --> 29:52.800
Of course, they lost..

29:53.800 --> 29:54.800
what's with that ‘of course’...

30:02.800 --> 30:04.800
This is the result of today's investigation.

30:04.800 --> 30:06.800
But I was very aware

30:06.800 --> 30:09.800
That Kogoro Mouri has no motive for the explosion.

30:10.800 --> 30:14.800
Motive huh..? 
|[Prosecutor Sayoko Iwai, 40 y.o.]|

30:15.800 --> 30:18.800
But the evidences are completed.

30:18.800 --> 30:21.800
We can start to sue tomorrow.

30:21.800 --> 30:23.800
Yes, but...

30:23.800 --> 30:26.800
For example, the record of accessing the gas plug at the explosion site

30:27.800 --> 30:34.800
There's a possibility that the suspect’s computer can be used as a relay point by a third person.

30:34.800 --> 30:39.200
that means, that person able to save the blueprint and the schedule in the suspect's computer.

30:39.200 --> 30:40.800
The possibility of deliberately saving it there is also very good...

30:40.800 --> 30:42.500
prosecutor Kusakabe...

30:42.500 --> 30:48.800
that's just your personal disregard of this evidence. Request an additional search to the police.

30:49.800 --> 30:52.800
Iwai, based on the results, decide whether to sue,

30:52.800 --> 30:53.800
or not....

30:53.800 --> 30:55.800
Please sue Kogoro Mouri..

30:56.800 --> 31:00.800
This is the judgment of the Public Security Bureau [PSB].

31:00.800 --> 31:01.800
you get it?

31:01.800 --> 31:05.800
This [PSB] means our own [PA-PSB], or the [MPD-PSB],

31:05.800 --> 31:08.800
or the [NPA-PSB]?

31:10.800 --> 31:13.800
Enough, please leave.

31:27.800 --> 31:29.800
A request for an additional investigation?

31:29.800 --> 31:32.800
Yes, commissioned by the prosecutor Kusakabe.

31:32.800 --> 31:35.800
So if the investigation results is positive, dad may not be sued?

31:36.800 --> 31:40.800
Nope. An additional investigation is to support prosecutor Kusakabe's view.

31:40.800 --> 31:43.800
The [NPA-PSB] seems to have decided to sue.

31:43.800 --> 31:44.300
Wait a sec..

31:44.300 --> 31:46.800
Why the [NPA-PSB] has decided to intervene?

31:46.800 --> 31:50.800
the [PA-PSB] who supervised [NPA-PSB] are more suitable for the prosecution..

31:50.800 --> 31:54.800
what's the exclusive authority of the [NPA]...

31:54.800 --> 31:57.800
You're right..

31:57.800 --> 32:03.800
But this is the case of the [NPA-PSB], criminal and special investigation department.

32:03.800 --> 32:07.800
As for the [NPA-PSB] involvement matter, the circumstances are slightly different.

32:07.800 --> 32:09.800
Master, you know it too.

32:12.800 --> 32:15.500
To put it simply, [PSB] are just the same. But..

32:15.500 --> 32:21.800
[MPD], [NPA] and Prosecutor's Agency [PA] have their each own Public Security Bureau [PSB].

32:21.800 --> 32:24.800
The Police reported the search results to the [PA] first.

32:24.800 --> 32:29.800
The case then will be investigated again after the acceptance of the [PA].

32:29.800 --> 32:33.800
So in general, if you want to sue a suspect,

32:33.800 --> 32:39.800
it will be judged by the prosecutors, based under the investigation results of the [PA].

32:39.800 --> 32:40.800
But....

32:40.800 --> 32:43.800
only the [PA-PSB] that was different.

32:43.800 --> 32:49.800
It's clear that the [PA-PSB] is different with [NPA-PSB].

32:49.800 --> 32:54.800
No matter how great the number of investigations or the technical differences

32:54.800 --> 32:57.800
Therefore, the issue of the prosecution,

32:57.800 --> 33:00.800
sometimes will be affected by the 'public security considerations'.

33:00.800 --> 33:02.800
Public security considerations...

33:03.300 --> 33:06.800
Especially these explosion of the summit venue incident,

33:06.800 --> 33:10.900
will put a big shame to the face of all police departments.

33:10.900 --> 33:14.800
surely that there will be many pressure like ‘has to be sued’.

33:15.800 --> 33:17.800
Then dad, he...

33:18.800 --> 33:21.800
Yes, he will be sued.

33:21.800 --> 33:23.800
how come…

33:24.800 --> 33:26.800
This lawyer..

33:26.800 --> 33:28.800
she's really expecting uncle Mouri to be sued...

33:32.800 --> 33:34.800
So now you're investigating the possibility of

33:34.800 --> 33:38.300
Uncle Kogoro's computer being manipulated by other person?

33:38.800 --> 33:44.800
Well, prosecutor Kusakabe asked us to do additional investigation...

33:44.800 --> 33:47.800
Well, tell me if you find something

33:47.800 --> 33:50.800
Shinichi said that he wants to help Uncle Kogoro

33:50.800 --> 33:53.800
So any information will be good...

33:53.800 --> 33:56.800
What happened to master Mouri?

33:57.800 --> 33:58.800
Mr. Amuro..

33:59.800 --> 34:00.800
Did you hear that?

34:00.800 --> 34:04.800
Hear what? I just worried about master Mouri.

34:04.800 --> 34:07.800
So I brought some condolences from Balo.

34:07.800 --> 34:10.800
Ah, Mouri is no longer here.

34:11.800 --> 34:15.800
in principle, if the suspect was sent, they will be transferred to the detention center.

34:15.800 --> 34:18.800
Mr. Amuro, I couldn't possibly know something like that.

34:18.800 --> 34:20.800
is that so..?

34:20.800 --> 34:22.800
You're still knowledgeable as ever..

34:23.800 --> 34:27.800
Ah, the detention center won't allow any condolences.

34:28.800 --> 34:30.800
I understand..

34:31.800 --> 34:33.800
What does he want to do...

34:38.800 --> 34:40.800
'2291' successfully invested.

34:41.800 --> 34:44.800
What did he say to Mr. Amuro?

34:46.800 --> 34:47.800
Mr. officer!

34:47.800 --> 34:51.800
Return the computer that you took from uncle. I have a game that I liked.

34:52.800 --> 34:55.800
So, please...

34:55.800 --> 34:58.800
That's an evidence, I can’t return it to you.

34:58.800 --> 35:01.800
Hey Conan, don’t be like this.

35:01.800 --> 35:05.800
That's a game that doctor gave me.

35:13.800 --> 35:18.200
Ah, Conan, I called you several times. Don't you received it?

35:20.800 --> 35:23.800
Huh? I run out of batteries.

35:23.800 --> 35:25.800
Can you charge with that?

35:26.800 --> 35:28.800
Thank you.

35:32.800 --> 35:35.800
Usually it don't run out so soon...

35:35.800 --> 35:37.800
Right, why are you calling me?

35:38.800 --> 35:40.800
The information of the incident is coming soon.

35:40.800 --> 35:43.800
Ran said that she wants to give you a look.

35:44.800 --> 35:47.800
Because Conan will catch some interesting clues...

35:48.800 --> 35:52.800
And if there is any situation, he will tell Shinichi...

35:52.800 --> 35:56.800
Um, I will definitely tell Shinichi.

35:57.800 --> 35:58.800
thank you, Conan..

36:00.800 --> 36:01.800
Thanks for waiting..

36:02.800 --> 36:05.800
This is the evidence that was submitted by the prosecution

36:05.800 --> 36:09.800
In other words, have you decided to sue uncle?

36:09.800 --> 36:13.800
There is a suspect in the [PA] that will soon be prosecuted.

36:14.800 --> 36:16.800
father…

36:17.800 --> 36:20.800
It doesn't matter, it will definitely save him.

36:20.800 --> 36:21.800
Go there

36:21.800 --> 36:22.800
Yes

36:22.800 --> 36:29.800
Mouth record, on-site appraisal book, and forensic photos on site

36:29.800 --> 36:31.800
So many of them..

36:31.800 --> 36:37.800
Damn, if I can’t find some clues, there is nothing...

36:34.800 --> 36:39.800
[[Explosion site International conference venue glass piece Kogoro Mouri's carbonized fingerprint High-voltage cable explosion debris]]

36:45.800 --> 36:46.800
what is it?

36:47.800 --> 36:48.800
ah, nothing…

36:48.800 --> 36:50.800
I thought to have seen it somewhere, but it’s just an inconspicuous black glass..

36:51.800 --> 36:52.800
After reading this

36:52.800 --> 36:55.800
Even if I know the the explosion techniques...

36:55.800 --> 37:01.800
The investigation data of [NPA-PSB] is like the crime operation guide.

37:01.800 --> 37:03.800
Operation guide...

37:08.800 --> 37:10.800
Yes, Tachibana here.

37:11.800 --> 37:12.800
court?

37:13.800 --> 37:14.800
…Ok

37:15.800 --> 37:17.800
the pre-trial meeting?

37:20.500 --> 37:21.800
Hey Iwai..

37:21.800 --> 37:25.800
Why are you telling me what to sue to the defense?

37:26.800 --> 37:28.800
How many times do you want me to say it to you?

37:28.800 --> 37:31.200
This is the judgement of the [NPA-PSB].

37:31.200 --> 37:33.800
Not only you want to sue

37:33.800 --> 37:35.800
Even the prosecution time must be heard from [NPA-PSB]?

37:35.800 --> 37:36.800
just now

37:36.800 --> 37:38.800
there was a message from the court

37:38.800 --> 37:45.800
that they wanted us the [PO-PSB].. to prepare the pre-trial meeting.

37:45.800 --> 37:49.800
Why do they contact you Iwai?

37:49.800 --> 37:51.800
I am the prosecutor in charge!!

37:52.800 --> 37:56.800
After the pre-trial meeting is over, please contact me.

37:59.800 --> 38:02.800
Look, all that ice cream are so big..

38:02.800 --> 38:03.800
really?

38:04.800 --> 38:08.100
Ah, I will ask where are the wheat flours and eggs .

38:08.100 --> 38:10.800
I will catch up to you later, Mr. Amuro..

38:11.800 --> 38:14.800
Miss Azusa will become a good wife in the future.

38:14.800 --> 38:15.800
Ehh?

38:16.800 --> 38:18.800
Be careful with your words!

38:19.800 --> 38:22.800
Mr. Amuro is very popular among female students that come to our cafe.

38:22.800 --> 38:24.800
There were rumors that I flirt with you

38:24.800 --> 38:25.800
Born on the Internet...

38:25.800 --> 38:29.800
who knows if the wall has ears in this era?

38:30.800 --> 38:32.800
really..?

38:39.800 --> 38:40.800
Mr. Furuya

38:42.800 --> 38:45.800
Why are you so obsessed to make this as "incident"?

38:45.800 --> 38:47.800
If it was treated as an normal "accident"

38:47.800 --> 38:49.800
We can't get any investigation warrant.

38:49.800 --> 38:51.300
if it's for the public safety,

38:51.300 --> 38:54.800
you should be able to conduct illegal investigation without a warrant.

38:54.800 --> 38:57.800
That's why, we must ensure that there are legal means.

38:59.800 --> 39:02.800
I will risk my own life

39:02.800 --> 39:04.800
for the illegal work

39:04.800 --> 39:06.800
that I have done.

39:06.800 --> 39:08.800
Because it's for the public safety.

39:08.800 --> 39:14.800
It is, however, the one that will decide whether the incident will be legally publicized or illegally concealed,

39:14.800 --> 39:16.800
should be our [PSB]!

39:16.800 --> 39:18.800
Of course.

39:18.800 --> 39:19.800
However..

39:19.800 --> 39:22.800
it's about whose face will protect Japan the most.

39:22.800 --> 39:24.800
Think about that..

39:26.800 --> 39:27.800
Ah, Mr. Amuro..

39:27.800 --> 39:29.800
They said...

39:33.800 --> 39:36.800
Please start clarifiying the evidences and the schedule,

39:36.800 --> 39:39.800
to be certified from the public prosecutor.

39:41.800 --> 39:44.800
Then I will start by submitting the list of the evidences.

39:46.800 --> 39:49.800
Ran, calm down

39:50.800 --> 39:51.800
but……

39:52.800 --> 39:55.800
Today is not a trial right?

39:55.800 --> 39:58.800
Yes, it’s only a pre-trial meeting.

39:58.800 --> 40:01.800
Just to submit the list of the evidences,

40:01.800 --> 40:02.800
deciding the schedule,

40:02.800 --> 40:04.800
didn't I already said that?

40:04.800 --> 40:06.800
But still...

40:08.800 --> 40:09.800
Master kyoko!

40:20.800 --> 40:22.800
Hello Iwai, this is Kusakabe.

40:22.800 --> 40:26.800
just now, the pre-trial arrangement procedure...

40:26.800 --> 40:29.800
what kind of evidences did prosecutor Kusakabe presented?

40:29.800 --> 40:34.200
the meeting just ended. The evidences was just the same that we got before.

40:34.200 --> 40:35.200
This is the list

40:35.800 --> 40:37.800
The date of the court session?

40:37.800 --> 40:39.800
Yes, it's fixed.

40:39.800 --> 40:41.800
it's all as expected..

40:42.800 --> 40:46.800
Sorry, just take a look. I need to go to the bathroom.

40:47.800 --> 40:50.800
Ah, Master Kyouko, the bathroom is in the opposite direction.

40:50.800 --> 40:52.800
Master Kyouko!

40:57.800 --> 40:58.800
This voice.. 

40:59.800 --> 41:03.800
it’s from Mr. Kazami... Is he nearby?

41:03.800 --> 41:05.800
...is...it seems...

41:05.800 --> 41:06.800
So close!

41:09.800 --> 41:11.800
Is he in this court?

41:17.800 --> 41:18.800
Where is it?

41:21.800 --> 41:23.800
This is the phone ringtone of master Kyouko.

41:23.800 --> 41:25.800
Ms. Kyouko?

41:25.800 --> 41:28.800
There's something I want to check for a moment..

41:28.800 --> 41:30.800
Ah, I will be back soon.

41:31.800 --> 41:35.800
Why master kyoko's voice is so close with Mr. Kazami's..?

41:36.800 --> 41:39.800
Is she near Mr. Kazami?

41:39.800 --> 41:43.800
Nope, the fact that I can hear her voice,

41:43.800 --> 41:46.800
means they're in such a close distance.

41:48.800 --> 41:51.800
It's not a coincidence...

41:55.800 --> 42:00.800
As a result of our investigation of the explosion site, the [PSB] is now making clear that

42:00.800 --> 42:03.800
[NOR] was used to gain illegal access of the explosion site.

42:03.800 --> 42:04.800
[NOR]?

42:04.800 --> 42:09.800
A browser software with an encrypted IP address that makes its source untraceable

42:09.800 --> 42:12.800
and can be accessed through multiple computers.

42:12.800 --> 42:16.800
Can [NOR]'s anonymity be lifted?

42:16.800 --> 42:18.800
In principle, it cannot be lifted.

42:18.800 --> 42:22.800
But if the [NOR] browser has a composition error or a bug,

42:23.800 --> 42:25.800
It's possible to track down it's user.

42:26.800 --> 42:27.800
on the other hand,

42:27.800 --> 42:32.800
If we create a hole in the [NOR] browser of the suspect,

42:32.800 --> 42:34.800
we can track it.

42:35.800 --> 42:38.800
Now our [PSB] team are currently exploring ways

42:38.800 --> 42:41.800
to trace the server and lock it's user.

42:43.800 --> 42:47.800
Sorry, there is a call....

42:48.800 --> 42:49.800
Permission to leave..

42:49.800 --> 42:51.800
Yes..

42:55.800 --> 42:57.800
Are you eavesdropping on a police meeting?

42:58.800 --> 43:00.800
Why are you here?

43:00.800 --> 43:03.800
As long as it is related to Kogoro Mouri

43:03.800 --> 43:05.800
You will be eager to take care of it..

43:05.800 --> 43:09.800
Or is it for sister Ran?

43:11.800 --> 43:13.800
It doesn't matter, come out.

43:16.800 --> 43:20.800
Why are you calling me? Mr. Furuya

43:35.800 --> 43:38.800
You called yourself a [PSB]?

43:38.800 --> 43:41.800
I'm.. I'm sorry...

43:45.800 --> 43:48.800
Impossible. Who is it..?

43:48.800 --> 43:50.800
Wait!

43:56.800 --> 44:00.800
You're the one installed the spy bugter?

44:02.800 --> 44:05.800
How can such a child...

44:05.800 --> 44:11.800
Mr. Amuro is from national police agency - public security bureau [NPA-PSB], [ZERO]!

44:15.800 --> 44:18.100
I know there are people like Mr. Amuro, being a [NPA-PSB].

44:18.100 --> 44:21.800
There are also a certain range of people in [CIB].

44:22.800 --> 44:24.800
Mr. Kazami is also one of them.

44:25.800 --> 44:28.800
who are you..?

44:29.800 --> 44:31.800
Edogawa Conan... 

44:32.800 --> 44:34.800
Detective

44:46.800 --> 44:48.800
The man you called Mr. Amuro...

44:50.800 --> 44:51.800
Is a murderer.

44:59.800 --> 45:04.100
Last year, he made an inspection suspect commiting suicide in the detention center.

45:04.100 --> 45:05.800
suicide…

45:07.800 --> 45:11.800
...sorry, this isn't something that a child should hear.

45:12.800 --> 45:16.800
I have no idea why I discussed this topic to you.

45:17.200 --> 45:19.800
You are such a strange child..

45:19.800 --> 45:24.800
As long as the [PSB] can lock the access source to the [NOR]

45:24.800 --> 45:26.800
Kogoro Mouri...

45:26.800 --> 45:28.800
excuse me

45:28.800 --> 45:30.800
There is a very bad situation in the city now.

45:40.800 --> 45:42.800
wha, what is going on?

45:46.800 --> 45:49.800
Mom, look!

45:59.800 --> 46:02.800
How many times do I have to tell you again?

46:04.800 --> 46:09.800
[As the Tokyo Summit will be held today, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government was heavily guarded]

46:09.800 --> 46:16.000
[due to the current incident, the Metropolitan Police Department [MPD] has not yet officially released any announcement.]

46:16.800 --> 46:17.800
[Not only domestic]

46:17.800 --> 46:23.800
[Many participating countries have expressed their anxiety and criticism to the Japanese government.]

46:23.800 --> 46:24.800
[Every intelligence electronics]

46:24.800 --> 46:28.200
[such computer and electric kettle will suddenly catch on fire...]

46:29.800 --> 46:31.800
what is going on…?

46:31.800 --> 46:35.800
[Repeat, Tokyo Metropolitan Government was heavily guarded for today’s Tokyo Summit]

46:35.800 --> 46:38.800
[Unbelievable phenomena happen one after another...]

46:35.800 --> 46:38.800
What is the purpose of the suspect?

46:38.800 --> 46:41.800
[Unbelievable phenomena?]

46:39.800 --> 46:41.800
Electrical appliances...?

46:43.800 --> 46:45.800
Just set the pressure, temperature, and the time with your phone

46:45.800 --> 46:48.800
You can make dishes like soup...

46:49.800 --> 46:51.800
So that it is..!

46:51.800 --> 46:54.800
The starting point of this terrorist attack is the explosion of the summit venue.

47:03.500 --> 47:06.800
Everyone has started to panic

47:17.800 --> 47:20.800
Sorry Conan, I don’t have time to talk with you right now...

47:20.800 --> 47:24.800
Inspector Megure, this must be an I.O.T attack.

47:24.800 --> 47:25.800
Hmmm?

47:25.800 --> 47:27.800
I.O.T attack?

47:27.800 --> 47:33.800
The suspect are making any appliances that can access the internet network to become out of control!

47:33.800 --> 47:37.800
So just cut off the network connection, and that would stop it.

47:41.800 --> 47:47.800
I.O.T attack? this is really bad.

47:50.800 --> 47:55.800
The cause of the explosion from the scene, also might be from an I.O.T home appliance.

47:56.800 --> 47:59.800
Suspect operated the gas plugs through the network

47:59.800 --> 48:01.800
Fill the room scene with gas

48:02.800 --> 48:05.800
Then I.O.T rice cooker was used as a time bomb

48:05.800 --> 48:08.100
that would be exploded at the summit venue

48:10.800 --> 48:11.800
So, that means...

48:11.800 --> 48:15.800
Yes, uncle Kogoro didn’t do it.

48:15.800 --> 48:17.800
really?

48:17.800 --> 48:18.800
Oops

48:19.800 --> 48:24.200
I just said what bro Shinichi said, so please take care of it.

48:27.800 --> 48:28.800
Conan

48:29.800 --> 48:34.800
He is also working hard for my father.

48:40.800 --> 48:42.800
Stupid

48:42.800 --> 48:44.800
It’s not just for your father.

48:46.800 --> 48:49.800
It that turns out to be true,

48:49.800 --> 48:51.800
Then our lawyer may win.

48:51.800 --> 48:52.800
Yup

48:52.800 --> 48:57.800
Because right now, the uncle was locked up by the prosecution and he's unable to access the Internet.

48:57.800 --> 48:58.800
Not really

48:59.800 --> 49:01.800
You can set the date back in advance

49:01.800 --> 49:05.800
So even if you are in a detention, you can perform the I.O.T attacks.

49:05.800 --> 49:06.800
Huh?

49:06.800 --> 49:10.800
After tracking to the server and locking the access source

49:10.800 --> 49:12.800
Suspicion to Mr. Mouri’s will not change..

49:12.800 --> 49:14.800
how come…

49:15.800 --> 49:19.800
But investigating the server is still very difficult.

49:19.800 --> 49:21.800
Can it be completed before the trial?

49:21.800 --> 49:24.800
It's not that difficult for police to do that kind of investigation.

49:24.800 --> 49:25.800
Wait...

49:26.800 --> 49:29.800
Why do you know that the police are doing this kind of investigation?

49:29.800 --> 49:30.800
Huh?

49:33.800 --> 49:34.800
Ah, sorry..

49:36.800 --> 49:38.800
About that, little kid

49:38.800 --> 49:42.800
Most of the investigations are done by the [PSB]

49:43.800 --> 49:47.800
Because the [PSB] have many [helpers]

49:48.000 --> 49:52.800
Is the [helper] a private person who assists the [PSB] in investigation?

49:52.800 --> 49:53.800
Yes

49:53.800 --> 49:58.800
particularly, the relevant personnel of the server, that was included in the investigation via communication monitoring method.

49:58.800 --> 50:01.800
There are many [helpers] of the [NPA-PSB].

50:02.800 --> 50:04.800
If you find a [helper] in that area

50:04.800 --> 50:07.800
It's much possible to obtain evidence of Mr. Mouri’s illegal access.

50:07.800 --> 50:12.800
Ah, of course, if there is such evidence.

50:12.800 --> 50:15.800
Forget about that television..

50:15.800 --> 50:16.800
Forget it?

50:16.800 --> 50:17.800
Yeah..

50:17.800 --> 50:19.800
I will hand it over to the repairman later.

50:19.800 --> 50:22.800
What is this? This strange feelings...

50:22.800 --> 50:24.800
There's something that she hides...

50:25.800 --> 50:30.600
About the series of event that has continued to cause confusion..

50:30.600 --> 50:34.800
The [MPD] has released an information saying this likely to be an I.O.T attack.

50:34.800 --> 50:38.300
no way.. I.O.T attack?

50:39.800 --> 50:41.200
It's truly hard to believe

50:41.200 --> 50:43.800
such terrorism method exist..

50:43.800 --> 50:45.800
Although it wasn't me who discovered it,

50:45.800 --> 50:47.800
thanks to him, we succeeded..

50:48.800 --> 50:49.500
So.. 

50:49.500 --> 50:52.800
it’s time to stop of our 'illegal work'.

50:52.800 --> 50:55.800
Let the [helper] stop..

51:02.800 --> 51:03.800
before that..

51:03.800 --> 51:07.800
Please tell me the information that ZERO has at this stage.

51:10.800 --> 51:11.800
[NAZU]?

51:11.800 --> 51:14.800
This information has been sent to the cybercrime dept.

51:15.800 --> 51:18.800
Let the [CIB] reported this results at the police meeting

51:18.800 --> 51:20.800
Why do you want to give the credit to the [CIB]?

51:21.800 --> 51:24.800
This should've been reported by us, the [PSB].

51:25.800 --> 51:27.800
This is a reward.

51:27.800 --> 51:29.800
Thanks to the [CIB] that the bombing

51:29.800 --> 51:32.100
terrorist attack could happened

51:32.100 --> 51:37.800
And I have told the [helper] that the information was provided by ZERO.

51:39.800 --> 51:41.800
Mr. Furuya is really scary.

51:43.800 --> 51:44.800
Kazami..

51:44.800 --> 51:49.800
There are two people who are more scary than me.

51:49.800 --> 51:51.400
And one of them 

51:51.800 --> 51:53.800
is just a little child..

51:54.800 --> 52:00.800
I'm thinking of the same child with you now, Mr. Furuya..

52:05.800 --> 52:07.800
According to the report,

52:07.800 --> 52:12.800
illegall accessed traces was found in Mr. Mouri’s computer.

52:12.800 --> 52:14.800
And indeed it's being used as a relay point.

52:16.800 --> 52:18.800
Then the traces?

52:18.800 --> 52:22.800
it was accessed from public WiFi using unrecognized mobile phones,

52:22.800 --> 52:24.800
We failed to track it down.

52:24.800 --> 52:28.800
But at the time, Mr. Mouri who was currently being detained by the prosecution,

52:28.800 --> 52:31.800
Has no way to reach any WiFi access point.

52:32.800 --> 52:38.800
What's more, this I.O.T attack is the same as the previous one.

52:38.800 --> 52:41.800
They use [NOR] for this illegal access.

52:41.800 --> 52:44.800
Surely, it is the same suspect...

52:44.800 --> 52:46.800
And how far the progress of the tracking?

52:47.800 --> 52:51.500
According to the cyber crime department reports,

52:51.500 --> 52:55.800
the tracking system had been developed by [NAZU].

53:01.800 --> 53:03.800
Sorry, I am late..

53:04.300 --> 53:05.800
Sorry, Miss Kuriyama,

53:05.800 --> 53:07.800
for interrupting your vacation

53:07.800 --> 53:09.800
It's Ok..

53:09.800 --> 53:12.800
As employee, how can I'm not helping my master

53:12.800 --> 53:14.800
At such a critical moment like this?

53:14.800 --> 53:15.800
It’s really a big help.

53:16.800 --> 53:18.800
Then take this...

53:18.800 --> 53:20.800
This is the investigation result for Tachibana.

53:20.800 --> 53:21.800
Huh??

53:21.800 --> 53:25.800
What? Shinichi Kudo didn't tell you anything..?

53:26.800 --> 53:27.800
Shinichi?

53:27.800 --> 53:31.800
Eh? Shinichi was interested with such a thing.

53:31.800 --> 53:35.800
Why should I investigate about Tachibana...

53:35.800 --> 53:39.800
Auntie, it is from Shinichi?

53:39.800 --> 53:41.800
There must be a reason

53:42.800 --> 53:43.800
Let’s take a look

53:45.800 --> 53:49.800
Last year, Tachibana's clerk had committed a theft case.

53:49.800 --> 53:50.800
Huh?

53:50.800 --> 53:54.800
isn't Tachibana an independent lawyer?

53:54.800 --> 53:56.800
Last year, she had her office closed.

53:57.800 --> 54:01.800
At that time, her clerk, Fumikazu Haba

54:01.800 --> 54:03.200
hacked a game company

54:03.200 --> 54:06.200
and was arrested after stealing the company data

54:06.800 --> 54:12.800
Then, Mr.Haba was sent for inspection, but he committed a suicide in the detention center.

54:12.800 --> 54:14.800
Huh? suicide?

54:15.800 --> 54:17.800
Suicide.

54:20.800 --> 54:22.300
What do you mean?

54:22.800 --> 54:28.800
I just found out that the computer of Kogoro Mouri was manipulated by someone else.

54:28.800 --> 54:32.800
Therefore, the possibility that he will be the suspect is very low...

54:32.800 --> 54:33.500
Okay!

54:34.500 --> 54:35.800
with that in mind...

54:35.800 --> 54:39.800
What about his fingerprint on the door of the high voltage cable box?

54:40.800 --> 54:44.800
What's with the burnt fingerprint? It's easy to be duplicated.

54:46.800 --> 54:50.300
Is that the order of the [NPA-PSB]?

54:50.800 --> 54:52.800
Do not sue Kogoro Mouri!

54:52.800 --> 54:54.800
Until the judgement ends as no prosecution..

54:54.800 --> 54:56.950
It's still a matter to our [PO-PSB], isn't it?

54:56.950 --> 54:58.800
You are annoying...

55:17.800 --> 55:19.800
Huh? prosecutor Iwai?

55:19.900 --> 55:24.800
Yes, although it's only a minor burns, she had been taken to the hospital.

55:25.800 --> 55:27.800
Is that also the I.O.T attack?

55:28.800 --> 55:30.800
After investigating the phone

55:30.800 --> 55:33.800
We found that it was activated via [NOR] just like before...

55:34.800 --> 55:35.800
Excuse me..

55:36.800 --> 55:38.800
Yes, Shiratori here.

55:39.800 --> 55:41.800
Huh? Hold a sec,

55:42.800 --> 55:45.100
The prosecutors has decided not to sue Mr. Mouri.

55:47.800 --> 55:49.800
Mom!

55:51.800 --> 55:54.800
thank goodness, sis Ran!

55:55.000 --> 55:57.800
Thank you

55:57.800 --> 56:00.200
I want to thanks Shinichi and Sonoko too..

56:01.800 --> 56:04.800
By the way, check this..

56:04.800 --> 56:09.800
Prosecutor's transcript of the trial of Mr.Haba at the court...

56:09.800 --> 56:11.800
What, this person..

56:11.800 --> 56:15.100
Isn't she the prosecutor Ms. Iwai, whose phone just got burned?

56:15.100 --> 56:16.800
she was the chief prosecutor last year?

56:16.800 --> 56:19.800
Yes, but this year she's just a general prosecutor.

56:19.800 --> 56:22.800
and became prosecutor Kusakabe's boss of the same period

56:22.800 --> 56:23.800
That's right..

56:24.800 --> 56:27.800
prosecutor Iwai's case is so strange

56:27.800 --> 56:30.800
But Mr.Haba theft case has triggered a huge success of her career

56:31.800 --> 56:32.800
What is this?

56:34.800 --> 56:38.800
Why are you investigating me and my clerk?

56:40.500 --> 56:44.100
I'm very sorry, I just wanted to know more about you.

56:44.100 --> 56:46.800
so I asked Miss Kuriyama for this.

56:49.800 --> 56:51.800
You're doing it very well..

56:51.800 --> 56:53.800
You're a 'good' clerk too.

56:53.800 --> 56:54.800
You're too??

56:55.800 --> 56:58.800
It’s like you're saying that she's just same as Mr. Haba

56:59.500 --> 57:02.800
But he is a bad clerk who caused the theft incident, isn't he?

57:02.800 --> 57:06.800
but master Kyouko's clerk isn't a theft like him, right?

57:07.800 --> 57:09.800
Fumikazu is not a theft!!

57:10.800 --> 57:14.800
It’s my fault.. Because I was helpless.

57:15.800 --> 57:17.800
You call him by his first name..

57:18.200 --> 57:23.200
Call the first name directly, to a clerk working at your office? Was it 'Fumikazu'?

57:28.200 --> 57:31.300
So you also knew that he committed suicide in the detention center.

57:31.300 --> 57:32.900
Ah, yes...

57:33.800 --> 57:35.200
He committed suicide.. 

57:35.200 --> 57:39.800
shortly after he was sent for inspection by the [NPA-PSB] 

57:39.800 --> 57:41.700
in the detention center.

57:42.800 --> 57:48.200
Last year, he made an inspection suspect commiting suicide in the detention center.

57:48.800 --> 57:50.800
Why the [NPA-PSB]..?

57:50.800 --> 57:53.800
I've never heard of such a thing.

57:53.800 --> 57:57.600
Many strange things are following Fumikazu's suicide...

57:58.300 --> 58:04.100
Ah.. Mr.Fumikazu Haba failed to pass the judicial practitioners' qualifications..

58:04.100 --> 58:06.100
Does he want to be a judge?

58:06.300 --> 58:07.300
Yes, but...

58:07.300 --> 58:12.300
when he came at the completion ceremony of the Judicial Research and Training Institute. He..

58:19.500 --> 58:20.500
Mr. President!!

58:21.500 --> 58:22.500
Mr. President!!

58:22.500 --> 58:23.800
Why am I..

58:23.800 --> 58:26.800
Why am I failed to pass the qualifications?

58:26.800 --> 58:27.800
Who are you?

58:27.800 --> 58:28.800
I am...

58:44.800 --> 58:51.800
That action, was judged and regarded as a runaway, due to a self-satisfied sense of justice

58:51.800 --> 58:54.800
the way to become judge was ceased to exist..

58:54.800 --> 58:56.800
And his judicial career life was torn apart...

58:56.800 --> 58:59.800
Why do you want to accept Mr. Haba as a clerk?

59:00.800 --> 59:04.800
Everybody.. has more than one side inside them,

59:04.800 --> 59:08.300
But you can only see one side of it.

59:13.800 --> 59:16.800
I've heard from your daughter on the outside.

59:16.800 --> 59:18.800
If Mr. Mouri's has been decided with no prosecution,

59:18.800 --> 59:21.800
Then, I have nothing more to do here.

59:27.800 --> 59:30.800
Then I also still have a job to continue...

59:31.800 --> 59:33.800
Are you investigating the [NOR] that was used by the suspect?

59:33.800 --> 59:34.800
Yes

59:34.800 --> 59:37.800
I was requested to assist in the investigation that has been submitted to [NAZU].

59:37.800 --> 59:39.800
[NAZU], that United States?

59:39.800 --> 59:40.800
Yes

59:40.800 --> 59:45.800
[NAZU] also had an incident with the same [NOR] last year.

59:45.800 --> 59:48.800
Ah, the one who was defended by master Kyouko.

59:48.800 --> 59:49.800
because [NOR] has triggered

59:49.800 --> 59:54.800
illegal access for so many people, [NAZU] has developed a system to track down it's users.

59:54.800 --> 59:57.600
We can ask their help tomorrow.

59:57.600 --> 01:00:02.800
[NAZU] was busy right now to complete the landing mission of the [WHITE SWAN] at the pacific ocean.

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.800
Ah, that unmanned spacecraft?

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:07.800
Yes, it's also overlapped with the summit today.

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:09.800
The [MPD] were quite busy.

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:12.800
is that so, the summit is starting today as well...

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:20.800
But the explosion happened at the [PSB]'s inspection shift time.

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:24.800
It's clear that the [PA-PSB] is different with [NPA-PSB].

01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:29.800
Therefore, the issue of the prosecution,

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:34.800
Sometimes will be affected by the 'public security considerations'.

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:41.800
Why master kyoko's voice is so close with Mr. Kazami's..?

01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:46.800
The man you called Mr. Amuro... Is a murderer.

01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:52.800
And Mr.Haba was sent for inspection and committed a suicide in the detention center.

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:56.800
Ah, I know this case.

01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:58.800
‘[NAZU] invasion incident’

01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:00.800
I.O.T attack

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:03.800
The suspect are making appliances that have internet access to become out of control!

01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:08.800
The investigation data of [NPA-PSB] is like the crime operation guide.

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:10.800
I found something matched.

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:14.800
it’s just an inconspicuous black glass..

01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:18.800
Wait... It can't be...

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:20.800
Miss Midori!!

01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:25.800
Send the details of the '[NAZU] invasion incident' to my phone immediately.

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:27.800
It’s what Shinichi said.

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:31.800
Ah, Conan?

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:35.800
We are going to the police station to pick up dad.

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:37.800
Really...

01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:40.800
How could Shinichi not picking up my calls?

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:07.800
You know I will come.

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:10.800
I felt something isn't right since the beginning.

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:18.800
Excuse me

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:27.800
I ask doctor to check it out.

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:29.800
A uknown remote control app was installed.

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:32.800
An app that doesn’t have an icon

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:34.800
You think that [NPA-PSB] was involved?

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:37.800
I know it wasn't you.

01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:40.800
I don't get it why you didn’t delete the app.

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:43.800
Because I’m going to have a suspect now.

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:44.800
no way...

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:45.800
You know who it is..?

01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:47.800
Well, 

01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:49.800
there are motivations.

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:52.800
Mr. Amuro, you're the motivation.

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:57.800
The beginning of the incident was ‘[NAZU] illegal invasion’

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:00.800
That happened last year...

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:02.800
because Fumikasu Haba?

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:08.200
because Mr. Haba committed suicide in a detention center last year.

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:08.800
Ah...

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:11.800
It’s today’s last year...

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:14.800
Today's last year..?

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:17.800
I see.. so that it is..

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:20.800
The revenge of the suspect is not finished yet!

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:40.800
I.O.T attack?

01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:14.800
Mr. Amuro!

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:22.800
Go!!!

01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:33.800
The unmanned spacecraft [WHITE SWAN] will now descending to Earth..

01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:38.800
Evening everyone, this is Nagano Prefecture National Astronomical Obvervatory [NPNAO].

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:40.800
It’s almost time.

01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:43.800
I will escort you all home.

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:44.800
Huh?

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:47.800
But the [WHITE SWAN] is coming back from Mars..

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:50.800
Let's watch the live broadcast.

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:53.200
Just watch it at your home.

01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:55.800
How cruel.. Haibara...

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:00.800
what is it?

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:06.800
Ah, the children are watching the live broadcast right now.

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:09.800
Huh? How long does it take to enter the atmosphere?

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:11.800
I think it should be...

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:12.800
from Kudo?

01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:15.800
Less than an hour?!

01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:17.800
time is running out

01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:19.800
Conan, is he really the suspect..?

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:24.100
Yes, he will infiltrated [NAZU]'s system and make the spacecraft fall.

01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:26.300
But where...?

01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:29.700
No way..

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:31.800
it's coming from the sky.

01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:41.800
Ah, it's uncle.

01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:44.800
Dad!

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:45.800
Oh...

01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:46.800
Welcome back

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:49.800
I was worried about you, Ran

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:52.800
thank goodness…

01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:56.800
And Eri, sorry for getting you in trouble.

01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:58.800
What are you talking about?

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:01.800
thank goodness, Ran!

01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:03.800
Sonoko, thank you!

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:09.800
Let's send this exciting moment to that geek detective.

01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:11.800
Sonoko!

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:14.800
This way, we'll be able to contact him. Cheese!

01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:22.800
What happened? Is there a power outage?

01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:24.600
Someone go check the power source!

01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:28.800
Chief! It seems the power have been cut off.

01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:29.800
What!?

01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:31.800
What is going on here!?

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:34.800
Report from [NAZU]!

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:38.200
The unmanned spacecraft was being accessed illegally!!

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:39.800
What did you say?

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:43.800
If this continue, we won't be able to separate the compartments.

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:47.800
[WHITE SWAN]'s body will just burn out after entering the atmosphere

01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:50.500
But, safety capsule's fall coordinate was changed!

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:53.100
[NAZU] in a total chaos.

01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:56.500
I'll send you the latest fall coordinate forecast info now!

01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:01.800
East longitude 139°45'8.405''

01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:04.800
The fall coordinate predicted by [NAZU] is..

01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:07.800
It is 'here'

01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:10.800
It’s going to be a big deal..

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:11.800
Conan!!

01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:16.800
Sure.. the target of the suspect is..

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:19.800
Police Headquarter!

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:22.800
The capsule is going to fall in the Police HQ building!

01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:23.800
How could this be!?

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:28.800
More than four meters of capsule will fall right here!?

01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:30.800
It's hard to imagine the loss!

01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:34.700
Prepare large Personnel Carriers immediately

01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:38.100
on the radius centered on the Police HQ, Evac order

01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:39.800
within one kilometer!

01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:40.800
understand!!

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:45.800
father…

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:48.800
It doesn't matter, I am here.

01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:49.800
Eri, you too

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.800
stay with me..

01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:56.800
Can it be?

01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:01.800
The capsule will fall at meteorite speed!

01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:04.800
that means that before entering the atmosphere

01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:07.800
Only a short time can control its orbit

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:17.800
There are many residential houses, parks, hotels, services, etc.. within one kilometer of the Police HQ..

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:21.800
The shelter must be able to accommodate many people!

01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:25.800
shortcut routes outside the range of one kilometer have been sorted out

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:33.800
[NAZU] reported that they failed to correct the capsule's fall coordinate!

01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:34.800
What?

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:40.800
The signal transmitted by the ground control center to the spacecraft was encrypted with a different password.

01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:45.800
If we can't get that passwords, the fall coordinate cannot be rewritten.

01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:48.800
In other words, did the suspect change the password?

01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:49.800
Yes

01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:53.800
Just when he illegally accesses [NAZU] to change the spacecraft's direction.

01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:56.800
We have to get that new password!

01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:59.800
A [helper] is needed for this.

01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:02.800
Thanks to your doctor who invented such a great thing.

01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:04.800
What do you want to do?

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:09.800
Let the dead resurrect

01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:15.800
Well,

01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:17.800
I wasn't expected of such a risk.....

01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:20.800
I hope I can analyze the code with this...

01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:25.800
After the improvement, the speed can be faster than before.

01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:29.800
doctor, your control is shaking..

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:33.800
There is only one chance of this!

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:37.800
Well, it’s my first time to fly this...

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:41.800
Ah, flying the drone at night, I want to try it too.

01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:44.800
Doctor you should be ashamed to play by yourself.

01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:49.800
There isn't [WHITE SWAN] on the TV.

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:52.800
Well, then please wait down..

01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:55.800
Doctor’s maneuver is terrible anyway.

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:57.800
Great!

01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:00.800
I am looking forward to it..

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:02.800
Do you really mean that?

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:04.800
Leave it to the children here.

01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:07.800
Let's keep preparing

01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:12.800
We are the drones flying team!

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:13.800
Go!!

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:22.800
We have arranged about 30,000 people now.

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:24.800
Going to the [EDGE OF OCEAN] refuge on the artificial land of Tokyo Bay

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:28.800
Where is that? I don't know.

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:30.800
Excuse me!

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:33.800
Is it the place that was scheduled for the summit?

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:34.800
Exactly..

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:36.800
We are going to the Casino Tower for refuge.

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:38.800
Cassino Tower...

01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:41.800
Ah, that it is.

01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:49.800
Yes, I have to call Shinichi.

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:04.800
[NAZU] still insist to break the passwords

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:07.800
But they always failed to connect.

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.800
If I can't find that password, then...

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:46.800
This is the information that you got from [NAZU]'s control center.

01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:50.800
Mr. Terrorist..

01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:57.800
I wasn't expecting you, Mr. Prosecutor Kusakabe.

01:11:58.800 --> 01:11:59.800
what are you guys doing?

01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:01.800
I should have discovered it long ago.

01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:05.800
When I see the list of evidences you've submitted...

01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:12.800
That piece of glass was part of a real bomb compartment

01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:16.800
Yet, you submitted it as an evidence.

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:20.800
while everyone thought it's just from a high voltage cable box.

01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:24.800
Nice timing..

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:29.800
This is the transcripts of the ‘[NAZU] illegal access incident’ that occurred last year.

01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:32.100
You're the one who was in charge..

01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:37.800
So that's it.. The motive was to get [NOR] for the unauthorized access..

01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:41.000
using the same technique of the incident that he was in charge of,

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.800
to launch a cyber terrorism..

01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:46.800
But you're miscalculated

01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:51.800
[NAZU] has developed a system to track the suspect.

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:53.800
After learning about this situation,

01:12:53.800 --> 01:13:00.800
you use the [NOR] to hack your boss' mobile phone to launch the previos I.O.T attack, and then you destroy the phone.

01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:04.800
This phone is a decoy that specifically guides the police to track the wrong source.

01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:08.800
So that's why the timing of I.O.T attack is so strange.

01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:12.800
I can't let you have my personal device easily!!

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:13.800
Wait!!

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:29.800
There's a trace of him using [NOR] in that phone.

01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:30.800
Very well

01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:39.800
I won't let you escape!

01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:47.800
Damn, it didn’t succeed?

01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:48.800
No problem!

01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:06.800
Prosecutor Kusakabe!

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:11.800
Do you really hate [NPA-PSB] that you did this such terrorist attacks?

01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:16.800
..destroy the summit venue and let the American's spacecraft fall in Tokyo

01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:19.800
shall reduce the arrogance of the [NPA-PSB]!!

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:22.800
Why do you hate the [NPA-PSB] so much?

01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:25.800
Your rage never vanish in just one day.

01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:29.800
Our [PA-PSB] will never achieve justice!

01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:32.800
It doesn't matter if many people dead for justice?

01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:35.800
I have no intention to kill the civilians.

01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:40.800
So I set the execution time only at [NPA-PSB] meeting.

01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:43.800
And selected I.O.T attack on house appliances

01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:47.800
Even the selected place where the capsule will fall is only there.

01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:51.800
You cut the police station's source power,

01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:54.800
was to make the civilians inside to evac?

01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:56.800
so that it is..

01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:59.800
You make I.O.T attacks on the road, also to prevent people 

01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:01.800
for going to the police station...

01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:06.800
even so, chance that some people will be sacrificed still exist!

01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:10.800
Sacrifice is needed to maintain justice!

01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:12.800
That's not a justice!!

01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:20.800
My.. My [helper] also had been sacrificed..

01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:24.300
So, Mr. Haba.. 

01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:26.800
indeed is your [helper]

01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:28.800
How.. How did you?

01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:31.800
Phone unlock password

01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:37.800
Because I rarely see it, I pay attention to it.

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:40.800
You didn't turn off the button to remind yourself to remember..

01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:44.800
Fumikazu Haba

01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:45.800
right..

01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:49.800
that's to seek vegeance to these bastard!!

01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:53.800
All the [NPA-PSB] [helpers] reported and managed by [ZERO]

01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:55.800
through private number

01:15:56.300 --> 01:16:00.300
But, the [PA-PSB] members doesn’t know each other’s [helpers].

01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:05.800
I don’t even know that even the [PA-PSB] also had [helpers], until last year.

01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:09.800
So you're saying that I should've just give up on my [helper]?

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:12.800
There is side story, isn't it?

01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:15.800
The theft incident of Mr. Haba last year...

01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:16.800
That's..

01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:19.800
I asked for his 'help'.

01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:23.800
in order to investigate '[NAZU] illegal access incident'...

01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:25.800
The traces of the access data 

01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:30.200
was left in the computer of the game company that got hacked. But Haba..

01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:33.100
he got caught by the [NPA-PSB]..

01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:47.800
[PA-PSB]'s [helpers] sometimes have to violate the law to conduct dangerous investigations..

01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:53.800
Because of this, the relationship between [PA-PSB] and their [helper] is closer than blood relatives.

01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:57.300
a kind of relationship where money isn’t necessary..

01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:01.800
It's all for the mission, that has chained us.

01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:06.800
Why you didn’t say that you're my [helper] at the trial?

01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:11.800
I can't leak your identity as [PA-PSB], because of my own mistake.

01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:14.800
Think about yourself, not me!

01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:17.800
I know better than anyone else..

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:19.800
The bitterness of so called 'justice'

01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:24.800
Please, consider your life!

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:26.800
Compared to my own life..

01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:30.800
The lives of many Japanese people are much more important.

01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:34.800
You have been saying to me this all the time..

01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:36.800
that you will bear my ambitions.

01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:43.300
I tried everything and ask the prosecutor in charge of that theft incident to set him free

01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:47.800
Haba is my [helper] when he committed that theft incident because of me. I'm...

01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:50.800
But I still have to sue him..

01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:54.800
No way.. is it because of the [NPA-PSB]?

01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:58.800
Relax, no words coming out from his mouth.

01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:01.800
I will go through this trial very smoothly.

01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:04.800
I am not talking about the trial!

01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:11.100
Then, when I was on my way to ask the [NPA-PSB] at police station..

01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:14.800
Yes?

01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:17.800
Haba committed suicide.

01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:22.800
The reason is still unclear

01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:24.100
But he did it

01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:28.100
after accepted the trial of [NPA-PSB] without a precedent

01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:51.800
Made Haba to commit suicide...

01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:55.800
this is all the [NPA-PSB] fault!!

01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:00.800
That's why you plan the spacecraft to fall in the police station...

01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:01.800
Yes..

01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:05.800
When I heard that the [WHITE SWAN] will return at Habawa's date of death, since then…

01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:07.800
I.O.T attack

01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:10.300
Originally, I never plan this

01:19:10.300 --> 01:19:13.800
But as a prosecutor, I just can’t let innocent people be sued.

01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:16.800
So in order to prove that Kogoro Mouri is not a suspect

01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:18.800
you launched the I.O.T attack...

01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:20.800
Yes

01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:23.800
But it's too late, disasters in front of us is already beyond expectations.

01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:26.800
You don't have to commit another sin!

01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:30.800
Tell us the password that you changed after the invasion.

01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:33.800
[PA-PSB] is an expert to enforce justice!!!

01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:36.800
Justice must be enforced for Haba!!!

01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:38.800
Tell us the password!

01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:40.800
Then I would better be arrested.

01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:43.800
Even if you interrogated me, I will never say a word!

01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:44.800
Prosecutor Kusakabe..

01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:49.800
Mr. Kusakabe..

01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:53.800
Stupid..

01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:54.800
What's this Haba...?

01:19:57.800 --> 01:19:59.800
This is a live view above the police station.

01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:02.800
what is going on?

01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:06.800
[NPA-PSB] interrogated him in a detention center

01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:11.800
In order to conceal the fact that [PA-PSB] also have used [helpers].

01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:16.500
He will pretend to commit suicide, erasing his previous life.

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:20.800
And so, in order to ensure the [PA-PSB] will no longer have [helpers],

01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:23.800
He has to keep this a secret from you.

01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:26.700
You fight best only for 'justice'..

01:20:26.700 --> 01:20:28.800
but terrible for 'illegal works'!

01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:30.800
YOU don’t have that ability!

01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:34.800
This is the decision of the [NPA-PSB].

01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:40.800
Mr. Haba’s sense of justice is very strong.

01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:43.800
Strong enough that he really insist to be a judge.

01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:48.800
So when he was failed the judicial qualifications and had nowhere to go

01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:50.800
You made him a [helper]..

01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:51.800
Exactly

01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:56.800
Mr. Kusakabe saved me from the bottom of my life.

01:20:57.800 --> 01:20:59.800
Although our relationship has only lasted for two years

01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:01.800
But Mr. Kusakabe..

01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:05.800
Thanks to you, I could fight as a [PA-PSB] [helper].

01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:09.800
And I'm still fighting like this..

01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:11.800
Mr. Kusakabe..

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:14.800
Please tell me the new password.

01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:19.800
The password! Haba could get hurt up there!

01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:24.100
Shut up! This is your [NPA-PSB]'s fault!!

01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:25.800
Just..

01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:27.800
who really did this?

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:29.800
Is the password still locked!!?

01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:32.800
‘[WHITE SWAN]’ is about to break into the atmosphere!

01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:34.800
Mr. Furuya!

01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:36.100
still not yet?

01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:38.800
Hurry and tell us the password!!

01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:39.900
Prosecutor Kusakabe!

01:21:39.900 --> 01:21:40.800
Hurry!!

01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:44.800
But...

01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:58.800
Mr. Kusakabe, actually...

01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:01.800
I always believe in you. But is this your justice?

01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:07.800
After illegal access to [NAZU]

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:09.800
The password I changed is..

01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:34.400
What!? 

01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:35.800
Black Out?

01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:36.800
Yes!

01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:40.800
it means we only have 5-minutes after the capsule entered the atmosphere!

01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:44.800
Therefore it's difficult to maintain the communication status

01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:48.800
It's still unclear whether the track can be corrected as well..

01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:52.800
And there's also the possibility of parachute-opening failure..

01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:53.800
How could!

01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:55.800
Haba!

01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:59.800
Haba! hurry and get down from there!

01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:01.800
Prosecutor Kusakabe!

01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:08.800
Have you received any call from Shinichi?

01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:09.800
No.

01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:11.800
I just received a phone message...

01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:14.800
Really? What is that guy doing?

01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:17.800
Conan seems to be off too...

01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:20.800
That little devil must be fine.

01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:24.800
This is really high.

01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:27.800
Come on, let's head inside.

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:34.800
Haba, come here!

01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:38.800
Where are you?

01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:42.800
He's not here.

01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:45.800
But... but the phone is...

01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:49.800
What you saw was a green screen effect.

01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:50.800
what?

01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:54.700
We use the drone to synchronize a real-time video at different place.

01:23:54.700 --> 01:23:57.800
So it will look like he's really here.

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:00.800
He's in a safe place

01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:04.800
Is that so...

01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:06.800
Mr. Amuro

01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:08.800
If you can't correct it's track,

01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:10.800
Then, the fall location..

01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:12.800
Yes

01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:14.800
More than four meters of capsule

01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:18.800
Will fall here at a speed of more than 10-kilometers per second.

01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:23.800
Mr. Amuro, can you get any explosives right now?

01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:26.400
You will try to destroy a heat-resistant capsule..?

01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:27.800
Nope.

01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:31.800
That explosives will change it's track to the ocean.

01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:35.800
Is that what you think?

01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:37.800
Is there any other way?

01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:42.800
Kazami, listen to what I say..

01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:46.800
Time to do the illegal work of the [PSB].

01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:57.800
This is the most powerful explosives collected by the [PSB] forensics.

01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:00.800
Are you sure it's ready?

01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:02.800
Almost finish..

01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:04.800
Just set the timer and it's ready.

01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:05.800
OK

01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:06.800
please

01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:17.800
The information provided to you is now transmitted to the predicted fall location of the capsule.

01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:22.800
Ok everyone, get ready.

01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:24.800
OKAY!!!

01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:29.800
You asked me to calculate where's the right location and distance to detonate those explosives?

01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:30.800
Seriously..

01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:32.800
Not everyone can be a hero.

01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:41.800
Mitsuhiko, Ayumi, Genta, and Ai

01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:45.800
This country is now counting on you guys...

01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:53.800
What? The drone is shaking

01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:55.800
The doctor’s cargo are too heavy.

01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:58.800
Do we really have to bring it over there?

01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:04.800
This cargo really is my big baby...

01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:08.800
The mistake range is approximately controlled at a radius of ten meters

01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:11.800
Transferring the video of the drone to your phone...

01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:13.800
Timing adjustment is up to you!

01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:15.800
I'm counting on you!

01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:18.800
But is it really okay?

01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:22.800
Do we really get the chance to record the [WHITE SWAN]'s capsule?

01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:26.800
It doesn't matter, I've been approved by the police.

01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:30.800
Well, it's a [NPA-PSB]..

01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:54.800
What? parachute failure?

01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:58.800
The insulation board seems to be locked down.

01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:01.800
Prime Minister! please order the destruction measures!!

01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:02.800
Wait!!

01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:03.800
What is it!?

01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:05.800
If it will be done that way..

01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:07.800
It may cause even bigger damage!!

01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:16.800
it passed 30,000 meters altitude..

01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:18.800
Yes

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:20.500
Alright.

01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:22.500
Don't fail.

01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:26.800
understand

01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:30.800
Mr. Amuro, can you decide the timing?

01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:38.800
We are approaching the capsule!

01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:41.800
will leave the rest to you,

01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:42.800
guys.

01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:48.800
It can crash if we keep continue,

01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:51.800
No, it doesn't matter.

01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:54.800
The drone is equipped with sensors that can sense the proximity.

01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:57.800
Automatic Avoidance System!

01:27:57.800 --> 01:27:58.800
Guys, 

01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:00.800
If you are not close enough,

01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:02.800
I can't matched the capsule.

01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:04.800
Huh? Why is that..

01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:06.800
OK, Mitsuhiko... Go!!

01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:08.800
All right!!

01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:13.800
Kudo, don’t fail...

01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:40.800
it's coming!

01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:44.800
GO!!!!

01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:14.800
Parachute...Opened...

01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:20.800
what?

01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:22.800
The display is gone..

01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:25.800
Maybe it's crashed.

01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:29.800
Isn't there a system that will automatically evade?

01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:33.800
Oh, ah... probably it’s run out of batteries.

01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:36.800
there is no such system installed...

01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:39.800
Well, looks like it succeed.

01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:42.800
But it’s really scaring me.

01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:45.800
Who.. are you...?

01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:50.800
Well, I'm just a small child detective’s [helper].

01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:54.800
Ah, understand.

01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:56.800
We succeed

01:29:57.800 --> 01:29:58.800
Thank goodness..

01:29:58.800 --> 01:29:59.800
Mr. Furuya

01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:02.800
We are here to arrest and escort the suspect.

01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:04.800
Wait

01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:09.800
Mr. Kusakabe...

01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:12.800
even we has separated, but we still chained

01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:17.800
Ok, let's go.

01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:20.800
Fumikazu!!

01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:21.800
Kyouko?

01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:25.800
Fumikazu!! 

01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:28.800
Now way.. you're still alive...

01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:32.800
Sir is such a scary person...

01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:35.800
It turns out that you are also a [helper]..

01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:40.800
And [PA-PSB]..

01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:44.800
Master Kyouko..

01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:51.200
Are you also a [helper]? of Mr.Kazami?

01:30:51.800 --> 01:30:53.800
Little kid, about your question..

01:30:53.800 --> 01:30:57.800
"Why do I want to hire Fumikazu as my clerk?"

01:30:57.800 --> 01:31:00.800
After he failed to pass the judicial practitioners' qualifications

01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:03.500
The police thinks he need to be watched,

01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:05.200
after looking at him.

01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:10.800
So they ordered me to hire him.. to report all his actions.

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:15.800
But after seeing Fumikazu's personality..

01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:19.800
I was gradually attracted to him...

01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:21.200
I feel the same way.

01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:27.800
So if things ended like this, I really feel sorry.

01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:31.800
You are [helpers] too, just like like me...

01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:39.800
The beginning of everything is the ‘[NAZU] illegal access’

01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:40.800
that's right

01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:45.800
When the [PSB] asked me to let this case's 'suspect' to be found guilty

01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:46.800
I did some research..

01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:52.800
But I found out that 'the suspect' of game company hack incident was 'him'.

01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:58.800
I don't know why he did that kind of thing.

01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:05.800
I have desperately asked the [NPA-PSB] to release him..

01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:06.800
But then...

01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:07.800
He committed suicide.

01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:10.800
I hate the [NPA-PSB]..

01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:13.800
So I closed my office,

01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:15.800
and return as a [helper] waiting for revenge

01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:17.800
at that moment

01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:22.800
You were ordered to defend Uncle Mouri to make him innocent, right?

01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:24.800
That's right

01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:29.800
Although that time I don't know why the [NPA-PSB] wants him to be released.

01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:32.800
But I've committed to make him guilty!

01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:35.800
Even if that people is innocent?

01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:37.800
I can't help it either.

01:32:38.500 --> 01:32:39.800
But I never know

01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:43.800
he was actually under the protection of the [NPA-PSB]..

01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:47.800
If I know, I won't...

01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:55.800
Fumikazu, you're now a [helper], right?

01:32:58.800 --> 01:33:00.800
what's your number..

01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:02.800
number?

01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:08.200
In the [PSB], we use number to nickname us.

01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:10.800
I am ‘2291’ right?

01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:14.800
Then what's his number!!?

01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:17.800
Tachibana Kyouko..

01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:21.800
You don't have to work as a [NPA-PSB] [helper] anymore.

01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:23.800
Right, Kazami?

01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:27.800
'Illegal work must be done by myself'.

01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:30.800
That is the 'Public Security'..

01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:33.800
Haba is here

01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:35.800
You are free..

01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:38.800
If you want to visit him, we won't stop you.

01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:40.800
Don't be self-righteous!!

01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:50.800
Being your [helper] is my own choice

01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:53.800
Betraying you is also my own choice.

01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:56.800
Falling in love with him is also my own choice.

01:33:56.800 --> 01:34:02.800
Don't think that you have control of my life.

01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:12.800
Goodbye

01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:17.800
Kyouko

01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:24.800
No matter how resentful she is..

01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:26.800
Protect her till the end,

01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:27.800
because..

01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:29.800
We are the public security!

01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:34.800
Thanks to you

01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:37.800
We can arrest terrorists who despise Japan.

01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:39.800
When did you find it was a terrorist attack?

01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:44.200
inspection inside the conference hall

01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:47.800
I found that the gas plug can be connected via the Internet.

01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:51.800
I think this may be exploited to carry out an explosion attack.

01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:56.800
Just when the instructions order of the [PSB]..

01:34:56.800 --> 01:34:58.800
I was involved in the explosion

01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:04.800
But according to the situation at the scene

01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:07.800
The explosion may be treated as an accident.

01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:10.800
So you created a suspect.

01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:17.800
I wanted to catch the suspect ASAP to secure the public safety and clean up the [NPA-PSB] name..

01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:22.800
Then you sent master Kyouko as a lawyer..

01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:25.800
And after the status of the 'accident' was completely denied

01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:27.800
you let uncle Kogoro regain his freedom back..

01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:32.800
You're smart as ever, you solved all the mysteries.

01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:35.800
Nope, there is still a mystery left.

01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:36.800
Is...

01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:37.800
your phone..

01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:41.800
It's been flashing since the beginning.

01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:47.800
Ah, Shinichi

01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:51.800
I'm taking refuge in the Casino Tower of the [EDGE OF OCEAN]

01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:54.800
Give me a call after hearing the message.

01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:55.800
What?

01:35:55.800 --> 01:35:56.800
the capsule?

01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:01.800
Because of an unexplained explosion

01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:04.800
The capsule is now heading to the artificial land of Tokyo Bay!!

01:36:05.500 --> 01:36:09.800
30,000 people taking refuge at one of that artificial land,

01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:10.800
[EDGE OF OCEAN]!!

01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:12.800
This can't be!

01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:14.800
Please go slower

01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:15.800
Time is still abundant

01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:18.800
Please calm down.

01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:22.800
Same as when you came

01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:22.800
Chief!

01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:25.800
because of the miss-information

01:36:25.800 --> 01:36:28.800
Many private cars also have come here to take refuge.

01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:29.800
Whatt!?

01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:33.300
The only path of the two bridges are now in dead traffic!

01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:42.800
This is awful... it's start to cause a big panic.

01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:43.800
...Shinichi...

01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:48.800
Damn, I can’t contact Ran.

01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:51.800
What is it? There's no time.

01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:56.800
Mr. Amuro.. this time, I want you to be my [helper].

01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:10.200
Dead traffic ahead!

01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:12.800
Is the evac guidance wasn't carried properly?

01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:18.800
Is that the Casino Tower?

01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:20.800
Mr. Furuya!

01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:24.800
The parachute of the capsule just cut off!

01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:25.800
And then?

01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:29.800
[NAZU] has calculated the predicted fall coordinate!

01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:33.800
It’s going to tear down the Cassino Tower in 5-minutes!!

01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:36.800
I will send you the information!!

01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:36.800
Ran!!

01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:39.800
Damn, what should I do?

01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:43.800
Mr. Amuro!!

01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:46.800
Hold very tight!!

01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:53.800
Mr. Amuro, what are you going to do!?

01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:16.800
Right here!!

01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:35.800
I thought I was going to die..

01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:37.800
How can you be so skilled?

01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:39.800
What would we do next?

01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:40.800
Wait

01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:46.800
Go to the building that was under construction

01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:50.800
Alright!

01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:01.800
Don't let go..

01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:04.800
Please calm down

01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:16.800
Can you catch up?

01:40:17.800 --> 01:40:21.800
Considering these building's height and the distance to the Cassino Tower..

01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:25.800
If you can accelerate from here after a minute..

01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:27.800
come on.. come on..

01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:30.800
Please..

01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:34.800
Hang in there... Ran!

01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:38.800
Wh..what?

01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:40.800
The power of love is amazing.

01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:53.800
I wanted to asked first.

01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:55.800
Does Mr. Amuro have a girlfriend?

01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:07.800
My girlfriend is...

01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:09.200
this country!

01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:16.800
Let's do it Mr. Amuro!

01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:18.800
Just one minute huh?

01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:21.800
It's the plan..

01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:22.800
Five!

01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:24.800
four!

01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:25.800
three!

01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:26.800
two!

01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:27.800
one!

01:41:27.950 --> 01:41:28.900
ZERO!!

01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:37.800
Not high enough!!

01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:39.200
Hold on!!

01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:19.800
GOOO!!!!!!

01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:33.800
Ran!

01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:34.800
father...

01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:36.800
Ran!

01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:38.300
I will deal with it later.

01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:39.800
Let's leave now.

01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:42.800
There is still a mystery that has not been solved

01:43:43.800 --> 01:43:46.200
Why you drag uncle Kogoro into this?

01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:51.800
From my position, I can’t investigate the situation

01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:54.800
If I get him involved

01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:57.800
You will inevitably become a helpful [helper]..

01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:02.800
That way, I could use your real brain power.

01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:08.800
You're overestimating me too much.

01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:34.800
A former public prosecutor has caused a series of terrorist attacks with such an unusual motivation,

01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:38.800
that was inspired from the police investigation materials' transcript...

01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:42.800
assertion to Makoto Kusakabe as the suspect by the Police...

01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:45.800
[PSB] has disappeared just like that..

01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:49.800
well, it will be the judgement at the [NPA-PSB] hand..

01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:56.800
After the incident of the tokyo bay....

01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:20.800
it don't think that they really contributed to retreival of capsule at all..

01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:22.800
And moreover, I just saved Japan's crisis..

01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:25.800
it's really amazing, guys..

01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:04.800
Let's meet again..

01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:08.800
On a ship that floating in the night sky..

01:50:09.305 --> 01:50:15.577
