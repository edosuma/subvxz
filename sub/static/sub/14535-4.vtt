Narrator:
<i> Previously on</i>
<i> "The American West"...</i>

00:09.709 --> 00:15.250
<i> As President Ulysses S. Grant</i>
<i> wraps up his final term,</i>

00:15.250 --> 00:19.667
<i> the country he leads</i>
<i> is as divided as ever.</i>

00:19.667 --> 00:21.709
- ( clattering, fizzling )
- Archie, get back!

00:24.375 --> 00:27.041
Narrator:
<i> In Missouri,</i>
<i> notorious outlaw</i>

00:27.041 --> 00:29.083
<i> Jesse James</i>
<i> takes revenge</i>

00:29.083 --> 00:32.709
<i> on the most famous</i>
<i> detective agency</i>
<i> in the country,</i>

00:32.709 --> 00:36.166
<i> and, in doing so,</i>
<i> establishes himself</i>

00:36.166 --> 00:38.250
<i> as a hero of the South.</i>

00:41.500 --> 00:43.125
<i> In the Black Hills,</i>

00:43.125 --> 00:45.375
<i> Grant's plan for peace</i>
<i> with the Indians</i>

00:45.375 --> 00:47.625
<i> has fallen apart.</i>

00:49.375 --> 00:52.166
<i> With Indian hostilities</i>
<i> at an all-time high,</i>

00:52.166 --> 00:55.667
<i> Grant sends Lieutenant Colonel</i>
<i> George Armstrong Custer</i>

00:55.667 --> 00:59.500
<i> to lead a final battle</i>
<i> for land</i>

00:59.500 --> 01:03.375
<i> that will change</i>
<i> the course of history.</i>

01:05.083 --> 01:08.333
<i> ( theme music playing )</i>

02:01.250 --> 02:05.542
Narrator:
<i> After refusing to report</i>
<i> to an Indian reservation,</i>

02:05.542 --> 02:07.834
<i> Lakota Sioux leader</i>
<i> Crazy Horse</i>

02:07.834 --> 02:10.125
<i> has been preparing</i>
<i> his warriors to fight</i>

02:10.125 --> 02:13.625
<i> the United States Army</i>
<i> for months</i>

02:13.625 --> 02:16.208
<i> and he's just gotten word</i>
<i> from his scouts</i>

02:16.208 --> 02:19.375
<i> that American forces</i>
<i> are on their way.</i>

02:21.709 --> 02:23.583
<i> But the Lakota</i>
<i> have brought together</i>

02:23.583 --> 02:25.542
<i> a massive force</i>
<i> of their own...</i>

02:28.166 --> 02:32.417
<i> and they're determined</i>
<i> to crush the invading army.</i>

02:33.625 --> 02:37.709
( speaking
Lakota language )

03:00.542 --> 03:03.208
Robert Redford:
<i> I think Sitting Bull</i>
<i> and Crazy Horse</i>

03:03.208 --> 03:06.166
<i> saw all that territory</i>
<i> as belonging to them.</i>

03:06.166 --> 03:08.291
They realized that
they were going to be invaded

03:08.291 --> 03:11.250
and what was precious to them
was gonna be taken away,

03:11.250 --> 03:12.667
so they fought against that.

03:26.208 --> 03:27.750
Narrator:
<i> Several miles away,</i>

03:27.750 --> 03:29.834
<i> Lieutenant Colonel</i>
<i> George Armstrong Custer</i>

03:29.834 --> 03:31.834
<i> has led his 7th Cavalry</i>

03:31.834 --> 03:34.875
<i> far ahead of</i>
<i> a much larger American force.</i>

03:38.333 --> 03:40.917
Paul Hutton:
<i> He doesn't wait</i>
<i> for reinforcements.</i>

03:40.917 --> 03:43.208
Custer wants this
to be a victory

03:43.208 --> 03:45.875
for the 7th Cavalry
and the 7th Cavalry alone.

03:48.291 --> 03:50.667
Narrator:
<i> Custer believes</i>
<i> that defeating Sitting Bull</i>

03:50.667 --> 03:52.500
<i> will be</i>
<i> the crowning achievement</i>

03:52.500 --> 03:55.834
<i> of his military career...</i>

03:55.834 --> 03:59.250
<i> and will clear a path</i>
<i> straight to the White House.</i>

04:14.667 --> 04:16.917
Mark Lee Gardner:
<i> Custer gets on top</i>
<i> of those bluffs</i>

04:16.917 --> 04:19.709
<i> and then he sees</i>
<i> this amazing village</i>

04:19.709 --> 04:22.709
<i> that seems like it</i>
<i> stretches forever.</i>

04:22.709 --> 04:26.291
There might be
as many as 6,000 Indians
in this village.

04:27.750 --> 04:30.375
<i> He's got less</i>
<i> than a thousand men.</i>

04:37.583 --> 04:39.750
We'll split
our forces.

04:39.750 --> 04:43.291
You keep the front busy,
and I will attack from the rear.

04:43.291 --> 04:44.959
No retreat.

04:44.959 --> 04:47.291
I need those
warriors busy.

04:47.291 --> 04:49.417
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

04:53.583 --> 04:56.792
Narrator:
<i> Custer decides to</i>
<i> employ a military strategy</i>

04:56.792 --> 05:01.375
<i> that worked for him</i>
<i> at the Battle of Washita</i>
<i> eight years earlier.</i>

05:01.375 --> 05:04.875
<i> He splits his men</i>
<i> into two smaller forces.</i>

05:04.875 --> 05:08.542
<i> Custer's second in command</i>
<i> Major Marcus Reno and his men</i>

05:08.542 --> 05:10.625
<i> will attack the camp</i>
<i> from the left,</i>

05:10.625 --> 05:12.458
<i> while Custer</i>
<i> and his troops</i>

05:12.458 --> 05:14.291
<i> attack the flank</i>
<i> on the right,</i>

05:14.291 --> 05:16.333
<i> dividing</i>
<i> the Sioux warriors.</i>

05:16.333 --> 05:18.583
Karl Jacoby:
<i> Custer's quite consciously,</i>
<i> I think,</i>

05:18.583 --> 05:20.875
<i> very aggressive</i>
<i> in dividing his men</i>

05:20.875 --> 05:22.542
<i> so that he can come</i>
<i> at this camp</i>

05:22.542 --> 05:23.875
<i> from multiple directions.</i>

05:23.875 --> 05:26.000
He demonstrated himself
to be either

05:26.000 --> 05:28.750
tremendously daring
or tremendously reckless

05:28.750 --> 05:29.834
or perhaps both.

05:29.834 --> 05:31.041
Hyah!

05:33.291 --> 05:34.834
Come on, now.

05:48.583 --> 05:51.542
( speaking
Lakota language )

06:13.959 --> 06:17.875
<i> ( troops shouting )</i>

06:22.083 --> 06:24.834
Hutton:
<i> There's just such</i>
<i> a beautiful romance,</i>

06:24.834 --> 06:28.917
<i> I think, to Crazy Horse,</i>
<i> the ultimate Sioux warrior,</i>

06:28.917 --> 06:32.083
<i> and Custer,</i>
<i> the ultimate American warrior</i>

06:32.083 --> 06:36.875
<i> of their time,</i>
<i> meeting on that final field.</i>

06:36.875 --> 06:39.083
<i> The Sioux are</i>
<i> at the height of their power,</i>

06:39.083 --> 06:42.625
<i> and here comes Custer</i>
<i> just right at that moment.</i>

06:42.625 --> 06:45.458
<i> It's almost like</i>
<i> it's meant to be.</i>

06:48.917 --> 06:50.917
Narrator:
<i> Following Custer's orders,</i>

06:50.917 --> 06:54.000
<i> Reno's command is the first</i>
<i> to engage the Indians.</i>

06:56.583 --> 06:58.500
<i> ( horse whinnies )</i>

06:59.667 --> 07:02.417
( whooping )

07:16.917 --> 07:18.792
Fall back!

07:18.792 --> 07:23.083
Gardner:
<i> Major Reno completely</i>
<i> loses his composure,</i>

07:23.083 --> 07:26.959
panics, he retreats,
and it's a complete disaster.

07:28.667 --> 07:30.667
<i> The men are scrambling</i>
<i> for their lives.</i>

07:33.959 --> 07:36.500
Narrator:
<i> As Custer arrives</i>
<i> to the battlefield,</i>

07:36.542 --> 07:40.166
<i> Major Reno and his men</i>
<i> are nowhere to be found.</i>

08:03.667 --> 08:07.166
<i> ( warriors whooping )</i>

08:12.041 --> 08:14.542
<i> ( whooping continues )</i>

08:21.667 --> 08:24.542
Custer:
<i> Dismount!</i>

08:24.542 --> 08:25.834
<i> Form a skirmish line!</i>

08:29.417 --> 08:31.208
Commander:
<i> Form a line!</i>

08:33.834 --> 08:35.125
Commander:
<i> Hold the line!</i>

08:35.125 --> 08:36.709
Watch your flank!

08:36.709 --> 08:38.041
Hutton:
<i> Custer's men are pushed back,</i>

08:38.041 --> 08:39.959
they take up
defensive positions

08:39.959 --> 08:41.667
along a ridgeline,

08:41.667 --> 08:43.792
<i> surrounded by thousands</i>
<i> of Sioux and Cheyenne</i>

08:43.792 --> 08:45.208
<i> led by Crazy Horse.</i>

08:53.792 --> 08:56.542
Commander:
<i> Hold the line!</i>

09:01.709 --> 09:04.542
Hold your position.
Keep firing.

09:10.125 --> 09:11.458
Agh-hh!

09:11.458 --> 09:13.542
Commander:
<i> Hold the line!</i>

09:15.750 --> 09:17.542
( speaking
Lakota language )

09:34.500 --> 09:36.834
Hold your positions!

09:36.834 --> 09:38.959
Take out your sabers.

09:43.709 --> 09:46.125
( whooping )

09:48.250 --> 09:50.583
Soldier:
<i> Sir, what do we do?</i>

10:07.917 --> 10:11.125
Gardner:
<i> We have all this imagery</i>
<i> of the Indians closing in</i>

10:11.125 --> 10:14.125
and his regiment
being a very compact group.

10:14.125 --> 10:17.542
<i> It was actually</i>
<i> a very messy, bloody,</i>

10:17.542 --> 10:19.625
<i> terrifying</i>
<i> last few moments.</i>

10:40.166 --> 10:42.667
( gasps )

11:04.583 --> 11:06.917
( clicks )

11:09.333 --> 11:11.291
<i> ( gunshot echoes )</i>

11:13.834 --> 11:15.709
Gardner:
<i> A lot of men said,</i>
<i> you know,</i>

11:15.709 --> 11:17.583
the thing is,
"Save the last bullet
for your life."

11:17.583 --> 11:21.917
Maybe Custer
committed suicide.
I don't know.

11:21.917 --> 11:23.458
<i> I just find it</i>
<i> hard to believe</i>

11:23.458 --> 11:25.001
<i> that he would</i>
<i> ever give up.</i>

11:25.001 --> 11:28.041
I think he would fight
as long as he could fight.

11:34.291 --> 11:37.834
Narrator:
<i> On June 25, 1876,</i>

11:37.834 --> 11:39.709
<i> George Armstrong Custer</i>

11:39.709 --> 11:42.041
<i> and over</i>
<i> 250 of his troops...</i>

11:43.750 --> 11:47.000
<i> are killed at the Battle</i>
<i> of Little Bighorn.</i>

12:08.458 --> 12:12.792
Narrator:
<i> Celebrated Civil War hero</i>
<i> George Armstrong Custer</i>

12:12.792 --> 12:15.375
<i> and over 250 of his men</i>

12:15.375 --> 12:18.875
<i> lay dead on the battlefield</i>
<i> of Little Bighorn.</i>

12:41.166 --> 12:43.834
( speaking
Lakota language )

13:00.208 --> 13:02.208
Larry T. Pourier:
<i> The Battle of Little Bighorn</i>

13:02.208 --> 13:05.041
<i> has mixed emotions.</i>

13:05.041 --> 13:09.792
On one hand, it was
the greatest day for us

13:09.792 --> 13:12.375
because we showed
our strength

13:12.375 --> 13:16.166
<i> and our wisdom</i>
<i> and our spirituality.</i>

13:16.166 --> 13:18.875
<i> But it was also</i>
<i> our worst day</i>

13:18.875 --> 13:22.125
<i> because of everything</i>
<i> that happened after that.</i>

13:30.583 --> 13:34.083
Narrator:
<i> News of the defeat</i>
<i> quickly reaches Washington.</i>

13:44.250 --> 13:48.583
- There were no survivors?
- Sherman: Not that we know of.

13:50.125 --> 13:51.417
<i> There's</i>
<i> still a chance</i>

13:51.417 --> 13:54.291
<i> a stray soldier</i>
<i> will show up.</i>

13:54.291 --> 13:56.375
Custer?

13:57.583 --> 13:59.458
Dead.

13:59.458 --> 14:01.333
A bullet
in his brain.

14:05.166 --> 14:09.291
Redford:
<i> The Battle of Bighorn</i>
<i> was this one single event</i>

14:09.291 --> 14:11.917
<i> that had a much</i>
<i> broader picture to it.</i>

14:11.917 --> 14:15.291
And that had to do with
the settling of the West

14:15.291 --> 14:17.166
and the loss
of parts of the West

14:17.166 --> 14:18.458
to Native Americans.

14:20.875 --> 14:22.959
Narrator:
<i> President Ulysses S. Grant's</i>

14:22.959 --> 14:24.959
<i> show of force</i>
<i> against the Sioux</i>

14:24.959 --> 14:26.917
<i> is a total failure...</i>

14:29.542 --> 14:31.875
<i> and the massacre</i>
<i> soon makes headlines</i>

14:31.875 --> 14:34.166
<i> across the country.</i>

14:37.333 --> 14:40.041
Gardner:
<i> This is the biggest story</i>

14:40.041 --> 14:42.166
for the last half
of the 19th century.

14:43.625 --> 14:45.291
<i> George Armstrong Custer</i>

14:45.291 --> 14:49.208
<i> was America's most</i>
<i> romantic, dashing,</i>

14:49.208 --> 14:52.875
<i> heroic cavalry figure.</i>

14:52.875 --> 14:55.417
<i> Ordinary citizens</i>
<i> loved him.</i>

14:57.583 --> 14:59.333
Narrator:
<i> Appalled by the slaughter,</i>

14:59.333 --> 15:01.542
<i> the country demands action.</i>

15:03.625 --> 15:06.542
H.W. Brands:
<i> When Americans at large</i>
<i> heard the story,</i>

15:06.542 --> 15:09.000
<i> what they heard was</i>
<i> that these savage Indians</i>

15:09.000 --> 15:12.250
<i> had massacred these</i>
<i> brave white cavalry.</i>

15:12.250 --> 15:13.959
They thought,
okay, well, this means

15:13.959 --> 15:15.625
that they
have to be punished,

15:15.625 --> 15:18.333
they have to be driven back
to the reservation.

15:18.333 --> 15:21.208
Narrator:
<i> With only months</i>
<i> left in office,</i>

15:21.208 --> 15:25.250
<i> Grant's plan for peace</i>
<i> with the Indians has failed</i>

15:25.250 --> 15:28.001
<i> and the country</i>
<i> is no closer to securing</i>

15:28.001 --> 15:30.583
<i> the gold-rich Black Hills.</i>

15:34.959 --> 15:37.083
<i> While the Indian Wars</i>
<i> continue,</i>

15:37.083 --> 15:39.208
<i> Grant's battle</i>
<i> with Southern sympathizers</i>

15:39.208 --> 15:41.166
<i> is getting worse...</i>

15:47.083 --> 15:49.667
<i> as former Confederates</i>
<i> like Jesse James...</i>

15:49.667 --> 15:51.417
Cover it up.

15:51.417 --> 15:53.500
<i> ...continue to resist</i>
<i> Northern interference</i>

15:53.500 --> 15:56.166
<i> after the war,</i>

15:56.166 --> 16:00.375
<i> including a policy</i>
<i> known as "Reconstruction."</i>

16:03.333 --> 16:06.333
David Eisenbach:
<i> The major question coming out</i>
<i> of the end of the Civil War</i>

16:06.333 --> 16:10.041
<i> is what do you do</i>
<i>with four million freed slaves?</i>

16:10.083 --> 16:11.500
<i> What are their rights,</i>

16:11.500 --> 16:14.208
<i> what are their positions</i>
<i> in society?</i>

16:14.208 --> 16:17.250
Reconstruction
comes up with an answer.

16:17.250 --> 16:19.375
They have equal rights.

16:19.375 --> 16:23.458
<i> There are senators</i>
<i> and congressmen who are black</i>

16:23.458 --> 16:26.250
<i> and tremendous progress</i>
<i> gets made.</i>

16:26.250 --> 16:28.625
But, of course,
there were elements

16:28.625 --> 16:31.000
<i> that wanted</i>
<i> to set the clock back</i>

16:31.000 --> 16:33.709
<i> that were not satisfied</i>
<i> with the end of the Civil War</i>

16:33.709 --> 16:36.500
<i>and certainly weren't satisfied</i>
<i> with these former slaves</i>

16:36.500 --> 16:38.250
<i> now having equal rights</i>
<i> with them.</i>

16:40.417 --> 16:42.375
Narrator:
<i> At the end</i>
<i> of the Civil War,</i>

16:42.375 --> 16:46.001
<i> thousands of Union Army troops</i>
<i> remained in the South</i>

16:46.001 --> 16:50.208
<i> to enforce the government's</i>
<i> Reconstruction policies.</i>

16:52.583 --> 16:56.041
<i> For Jesse James,</i>
<i> the Northern occupation</i>
<i> of the South</i>

16:56.041 --> 16:59.625
<i> represents everything</i>
<i> he's been fighting against.</i>

17:03.125 --> 17:06.500
<i> And now, with the nation</i>
<i> facing an upcoming election,</i>

17:06.500 --> 17:09.458
<i> he plans to make</i>
<i> his biggest demonstration</i>

17:09.458 --> 17:11.291
<i> of Southern resistance yet...</i>

17:14.125 --> 17:16.500
<i> by launching</i>
<i> his first big attack</i>

17:16.500 --> 17:19.458
<i> deep in Northern territory.</i>

17:29.542 --> 17:31.375
You can rob a bank
in Missouri.

17:31.375 --> 17:33.001
Why do you have
to go hundreds of miles away

17:33.001 --> 17:35.291
to rob a bank?
They got plenty of banks.

17:36.375 --> 17:38.083
<i> Because he had heard</i>

17:38.083 --> 17:41.500
<i> that the Reconstruction</i>
<i> governor of Mississippi,</i>

17:41.500 --> 17:45.000
<i> Adelbert Ames,</i>
<i> had relatives up</i>
<i> in Northfield,</i>

17:45.000 --> 17:47.542
and a lot of his money
was in this bank.

17:51.375 --> 17:53.333
<i> And James decided,</i>
<i> "We're gonna go up there</i>

17:53.333 --> 17:56.375
<i> and we're gonna rob that bank</i>
<i> to take the money</i>

17:56.375 --> 17:59.250
of the Reconstruction governor
of Mississippi."

18:01.250 --> 18:03.208
Narrator:
<i> Working with</i>
<i> his brother Frank</i>

18:03.208 --> 18:05.041
<i> and the rest</i>
<i> of the James Gang,</i>

18:05.041 --> 18:09.041
<i> Jesse spends weeks</i>
<i> planning a heist so bold,</i>

18:09.041 --> 18:11.667
<i> it's sure to grab</i>
<i> national attention.</i>

18:11.667 --> 18:15.625
All right, this time, we're
gonna do it a little different.

18:15.625 --> 18:18.667
<i> We're gonna split up</i>
<i> into three groups.</i>

18:18.667 --> 18:22.250
Clell, cut all
the telegraph wires.

18:22.250 --> 18:24.125
( snaps )

18:24.125 --> 18:26.542
We don't want any information
gettin' in or out of town.

18:26.542 --> 18:30.041
Cole, Bob, I want you
to stand guard

18:30.041 --> 18:32.291
<i> out front of the bank.</i>

18:32.291 --> 18:34.709
Frank, Charlie,

18:34.709 --> 18:37.709
<i> the three of us</i>
<i> will head inside.</i>

18:37.709 --> 18:40.792
Now, when the robbery
is over,

18:40.792 --> 18:45.083
we're all gonna meet
down here near this bridge.

18:49.375 --> 18:50.583
<i> We'll be</i>
<i> a hundred miles away</i>

18:50.583 --> 18:53.166
before anyone knows
what happened.

19:34.291 --> 19:36.333
( whinnies )

19:41.667 --> 19:45.125
Move! We intend
to rob this here bank!

19:45.125 --> 19:47.333
Who's the cashier?

19:47.333 --> 19:50.417
- Who's the cashier?
- The cashier's
not here today, sir.

19:50.417 --> 19:52.667
Have a seat, son.

19:52.667 --> 19:56.375
- Open the safe.
- I cannot open
the safe, sir.

20:00.542 --> 20:02.208
You know what
I don't like?

20:03.917 --> 20:05.667
I don't like
being lied to.

20:05.667 --> 20:08.375
( panting )

20:08.375 --> 20:10.166
You open
that safe now.

20:10.166 --> 20:12.375
I can't, I can't.

20:14.291 --> 20:16.291
Gardner:
<i> The key to the success</i>
<i> for the James Gang</i>

20:16.291 --> 20:18.500
has always been speed,
quickness.

20:18.500 --> 20:20.625
There ain't nothin'
in here!

20:20.625 --> 20:22.250
Gardner:
<i> Joseph Lee Heywood,</i>

Open the goddamn safe!

20:27.834 --> 20:29.500

20:33.583 --> 20:35.625
You the cashier?
Turn around!

Eisenbach:
<i> Jesse James decides</i>

20:50.667 --> 20:52.375
So you had
all these hunters

20:52.375 --> 20:55.250
who are in town
buying supplies

20:55.250 --> 20:57.291
and they're getting
very suspicious

20:57.291 --> 20:58.917
<i> 'cause there are</i>

21:11.208 --> 21:12.667
<i> telling people</i>
<i> to get back.</i>

21:12.667 --> 21:13.875
This is kind of
shock and awe

21:13.875 --> 21:15.375
in the middle
of the street,

21:15.375 --> 21:17.208
but these people
aren't being shocked

21:17.208 --> 21:19.333
<i> and they're not being awed.</i>

21:19.375 --> 21:22.375
<i> Townspeople</i>

Agh-hh!

21:39.583 --> 21:42.208
Jesse, time's up!

22:02.375 --> 22:04.667
Gardner:
<i> It's pandemonium.</i>

22:04.667 --> 22:06.583
The outlaws
are firing revolvers,

22:06.583 --> 22:08.834
which are pretty inaccurate
on horseback.

22:10.500 --> 22:12.875
<i> The townspeople</i>

22:12.875 --> 22:14.583
<i> They're very accurate.</i>

22:14.583 --> 22:17.959
These guys are getting
shot to pieces on the street.

22:20.792 --> 22:23.959
<i> It was a complete disaster</i>

22:23.959 --> 22:25.917

<i> Had they just tried</i>
<i> that handle,</i>

23:45.000 --> 23:48.542
it would've opened up

23:51.000 --> 23:54.166
Narrator:
<i> The robbery is</i>
<i> a complete failure.</i>

23:54.166 --> 23:58.542
<i> The people of Northfield</i>

24:33.166 --> 24:34.750
<i> at the Northfield Bank...</i>

24:36.125 --> 24:38.125
<i> local citizens</i>
<i> are on a mission</i>

24:38.125 --> 24:42.667
<i> to track down</i>
<i> the notorious outlaw</i>
<i> and his gang.</i>

24:42.667 --> 24:45.458
Danny Glover:
<i> In the West there were</i>
<i> these citizens</i>

24:45.458 --> 24:48.667
<i> who, in their passion,</i>
<i> their anger,</i>

24:48.667 --> 24:51.750
their authority

<i> they go out to bring</i>
<i> these men to justice.</i>

24:54.959 --> 24:56.917
<i> They were</i>
<i> law-abiding citizens</i>

24:56.917 --> 24:59.000
<i> who take the law</i>
<i> into their own hands.</i>

25:01.458 --> 25:02.959
Narrator:

25:02.959 --> 25:04.750
<i> quickly spreads</i>

25:04.750 --> 25:06.959
<i> turning a small-town chase</i>

25:06.959 --> 25:08.792

Gardner:
<i> There were at least</i>
<i> a thousand men</i>

25:12.750 --> 25:14.166

25:17.166 --> 25:19.875
It was
instant national news,

<i> especially</i>
<i> when the James Gang</i>

25:22.750 --> 25:25.709

<i> that went along</i>
<i> with the posses,</i>

25:30.001 --> 25:33.750
keeping track of the manhunt
and how it was progressing.

25:33.750 --> 25:36.917
<i> Jesse and Frank were</i>
<i> Southern boys and murderers.</i>

25:39.792 --> 25:41.625
They were hated
in Minnesota,

25:41.625 --> 25:43.959
and everyone wanted
to see them captured

25:43.959 --> 25:46.709

25:46.709 --> 25:48.917
Narrator:

<i> almost all</i>
<i> of the James Gang</i>

25:52.875 --> 25:56.834
<i> The only fugitives</i>
<i> they're unable to track down</i>

25:56.834 --> 25:59.542
<i> are Jesse</i>
<i> and his brother Frank.</i>

25:59.542 --> 26:01.583
Gardner:
<i> These guys were masters</i>

26:01.583 --> 26:03.542
at concealing themselves
and getting away.

26:03.542 --> 26:06.542
They had to do it
all during the Civil War.

26:06.542 --> 26:08.083
<i> They were always</i>
<i> outnumbered.</i>

26:08.083 --> 26:10.709
<i> They always had people</i>
<i> chasing them.</i>

26:19.834 --> 26:22.166
<i> Northfield was</i>
<i> the biggest disaster</i>

26:22.166 --> 26:25.625

26:33.917 --> 26:37.625
They both suffered
gunshot wounds.

26:37.625 --> 26:39.625
<i> But I think, in a way,</i>

26:39.625 --> 26:42.709
<i> mentally in some way,</i>
<i> they're wounded as well.</i>

26:46.917 --> 26:50.250
Narrator:
<i> Now the most wanted man</i>
<i> in America</i>

26:50.250 --> 26:53.041
<i> is forced</i>
<i> to go into hiding,</i>

26:53.041 --> 26:54.917
<i> and it will be</i>
<i> two years</i>

26:54.917 --> 26:58.625
<i> before the world</i>
<i> gets another glimpse</i>

26:58.625 --> 27:00.875
<i> of Jesse James.</i>

27:02.959 --> 27:05.625
<i> While his robbery</i>
<i> may have been a failure,</i>

27:05.625 --> 27:10.709
<i> Jesse's Confederate cause</i>
<i> may finally have a victory.</i>

27:12.667 --> 27:15.834
<i> With the presidential election</i>
<i> just around the corner,</i>

27:15.834 --> 27:21.125
<i> a strong pro-South candidate</i>
<i>named Samuel Tilden has emerged</i>

27:21.125 --> 27:24.291
<i> with a plan to put an end</i>
<i> to Reconstruction.</i>

27:26.291 --> 27:29.875
Foner:
<i> Samuel J. Tilden</i>
<i> had criticized Emancipation.</i>

27:29.875 --> 27:32.917
Tilden was explicit about
wanting to end Reconstruction

27:32.917 --> 27:35.583
and attacking Reconstruction.

27:35.583 --> 27:39.917
<i> But then Tilden was also</i>
<i> overtly racist.</i>

27:39.917 --> 27:42.667
Narrator:
<i> Opposing him is</i>
<i> a former Union general</i>

27:42.667 --> 27:45.041
<i> named Rutherford B. Hayes.</i>

27:45.041 --> 27:48.625
Foner:
<i> Hayes was</i>
<i> the governor of Ohio,</i>

27:48.625 --> 27:50.667
<i> and he was</i>
<i> a mainstream Republican.</i>

27:50.667 --> 27:52.166
Hayes would say,
"We want to make sure

27:52.166 --> 27:54.667
that blacks' rights
are guaranteed."

27:58.208 --> 28:01.041
Narrator:
<i> On November 7th, 1876,</i>

28:01.041 --> 28:03.250
<i> Southerners</i>
<i> flocked to the polls</i>

28:03.250 --> 28:05.917
<i> in unprecedented numbers,</i>

28:05.917 --> 28:09.750
<i> knowing that if they can</i>
<i> put Tilden in the White House,</i>

28:09.750 --> 28:12.083
<i> they could put an end</i>
<i> to Northern policies</i>

28:12.083 --> 28:15.250
<i> that have been in place</i>
<i> since the end of the war.</i>

28:25.667 --> 28:27.125
<i> On election night,</i>

28:27.125 --> 28:29.750
<i> votes roll in</i>
<i> from across the country.</i>

28:34.709 --> 28:37.083
Governor Hayes,
news from Washington.

28:42.041 --> 28:45.166
Narrator:
<i> But when the returns</i>
<i> are counted,</i>

28:45.166 --> 28:47.875
<i> the results are unclear.</i>

28:52.041 --> 28:54.917
Foner:
<i> The morning after</i>
<i> the election of 1876,</i>

28:54.917 --> 28:56.875
it's not quite clear
who has won.

28:56.875 --> 28:59.959
<i> The returns</i>
<i> from three Southern states</i>

28:59.959 --> 29:01.959
<i> were disputed--</i>

29:01.959 --> 29:05.709
<i> South Carolina,</i>
<i> Florida, and Louisiana.</i>

29:05.709 --> 29:08.792
<i> And both sides claimed</i>
<i> to have carried those states</i>

29:08.792 --> 29:11.208
<i> for their candidate.</i>

29:11.208 --> 29:12.959
In 2000,
we went through

29:12.959 --> 29:15.041
another disputed
presidential election.

29:15.041 --> 29:16.750
<i> And, of course,</i>
<i> there it focused</i>

29:16.750 --> 29:19.959
<i> on disputed returns</i>
<i> from Florida.</i>

29:19.959 --> 29:23.166
<i> So there was great confusion,</i>
<i> uncertainty,</i>

29:23.166 --> 29:26.792
<i> a lot of heated</i>
<i> political rhetoric.</i>

29:26.792 --> 29:28.834
Narrator:
<i> With no clear winner,</i>

29:28.834 --> 29:31.834
<i> Americans begin to panic</i>

29:31.834 --> 29:35.959
<i> and rumors began</i>
<i> to spread.</i>

29:35.959 --> 29:38.750
Foner:
<i> It was an unprecedented</i>
<i> situation.</i>

29:38.750 --> 29:41.458
<i> Some Democrat said</i>
<i> if Tilden is not inaugurated,</i>

29:41.458 --> 29:46.166
100,000 people
will march on Washington.

29:46.166 --> 29:49.875
<i> People talked about</i>
<i> a new civil war.</i>

30:07.250 --> 30:10.166
There's rumors of
a hundred thousand men
marching on the capital.

30:18.792 --> 30:21.458
Have 4,000 men
ready to defend the capital.

30:22.959 --> 30:25.834
<i> Post the USS Wyoming</i>
<i> in the Potomac.</i>

30:25.834 --> 30:28.875
Peace must be maintained
at all costs.

30:28.875 --> 30:30.250
Yes, sir.

30:33.834 --> 30:36.500
Narrator:
<i> After dealing with</i>
<i> an economic depression</i>

<i>and leading an unsuccessful war</i>
<i> against the Indians,</i>

<i> Ulysses S. Grant is facing</i>

<i> Three months after</i>

31:01.375 --> 31:03.500
<i> ends in controversy,</i>

31:03.500 --> 31:06.041
<i> tensions between</i>
<i> North and South</i>

31:06.041 --> 31:10.333
<i> are the highest they've been</i>
<i> since the Civil War ended</i>

31:10.333 --> 31:14.333
<i> and the future of the country</i>
<i> hangs in the balance.</i>

31:14.333 --> 31:16.542
...electoral votes
that must be won...

31:16.542 --> 31:19.041
I don't care how many
electoral votes he has,
all right?

31:20.417 --> 31:23.875
Narrator:
<i> To find a solution,</i>
<i> a secret meeting is convened</i>

31:23.875 --> 31:28.125
<i> between the teams of</i>
<i> both presidential candidates.</i>

31:28.125 --> 31:30.250
Hayes men and Tilden men
got together

31:30.250 --> 31:32.875
<i> in a hotel</i>
<i> in Washington</i>

31:32.875 --> 31:34.333
<i> and hammered out</i>
<i> an agreement.</i>

31:34.333 --> 31:37.000
There has to be
some give and some take.

31:39.041 --> 31:42.291
We give you the presidency,
and you pull out the troops.

31:44.333 --> 31:47.500
<i> It's that simple,</i>
<i> gentlemen.</i>

31:47.500 --> 31:50.458
We want the troops
out of the South.

31:52.458 --> 31:54.417
Narrator:
<i> After over eight million</i>
<i> Americans</i>

31:54.417 --> 31:56.333
<i> cast their votes,</i>

<i> the presidency</i>
<i> is ultimately decided</i>

31:58.375 --> 32:01.417
<i> by 15 men</i>
<i> in a backroom deal</i>

32:01.417 --> 32:05.333
<i> that will come to be known</i>
<i> as "the Corrupt Bargain."</i>

32:09.083 --> 32:11.959
The deal was
Hayes would become president.

32:11.959 --> 32:14.041
But in exchange for this,

32:14.041 --> 32:17.458
<i> he would withdraw</i>
<i> remaining Federal troops</i>

32:17.458 --> 32:19.458
<i> from the South.</i>

32:19.458 --> 32:22.000
<i> This would bring</i>
<i> Reconstruction</i>

32:22.000 --> 32:25.875
<i> under a military authority</i>
<i> to a definitive end.</i>

32:30.166 --> 32:32.917
Narrator:
<i> The end of Reconstruction</i>
<i> is a victory for Southerners</i>

32:32.917 --> 32:36.875
<i> who've rallied around rebels</i>
<i> like Jesse James.</i>

32:36.875 --> 32:39.458
<i> But for newly freed</i>
<i> African Americans,</i>

32:39.458 --> 32:41.709
<i> it comes</i>
<i> at a heavy cost.</i>

32:44.458 --> 32:46.667
The Bargain of 1877
marks the end

32:46.667 --> 32:50.250
of a federal commitment
to protect the basic rights

32:50.250 --> 32:53.625
<i> of black citizens</i>
<i> in the South.</i>

32:53.625 --> 32:55.250
<i> It basically recognizes</i>

32:55.250 --> 32:57.250
<i> the white supremacist</i>
<i> Democratic Party</i>

32:57.291 --> 32:59.417
<i> as being in control.</i>

33:01.625 --> 33:03.333
Narrator:
<i> With one decision,</i>

33:03.333 --> 33:05.375
<i> the rights of freed slaves</i>
<i> in the South</i>

33:05.375 --> 33:07.625
<i> to vote</i>
<i> and hold office</i>

33:07.667 --> 33:10.166
<i> are no longer protected.</i>

33:10.166 --> 33:12.500
<i> It will be nearly</i>
<i> another 100 years</i>

33:12.500 --> 33:15.000
<i> before they are granted</i>
<i> equal rights</i>

33:15.000 --> 33:17.250
<i> under the Constitution.</i>

33:22.542 --> 33:27.625
<i> The deal marks a sad end</i>
<i> to Grant's presidency.</i>

33:27.625 --> 33:31.041
Brands:
<i> When Grant got</i>
<i> the nomination in 1868,</i>

33:31.041 --> 33:33.583
<i> the phrase that won him</i>
<i> the hearts of most Americans</i>

33:33.583 --> 33:35.417
was "Let us have peace."

33:35.417 --> 33:38.458
<i> That was the platform</i>
<i> that he ran on.</i>

33:38.458 --> 33:41.667
<i> But in 1876,</i>
<i> he was losing the battle</i>

33:41.667 --> 33:44.125
<i> with respect</i>
<i> to Indian policy.</i>

33:44.125 --> 33:47.083
Now he lost the battle
with respect to equal rights

33:47.083 --> 33:49.083
for freedom in the South.

33:52.417 --> 33:54.333
Narrator:
<i> Despite his failings,</i>

33:54.333 --> 33:56.208
<i> Grant oversaw</i>
<i> the completion</i>

33:56.208 --> 33:58.750
<i> of the transcontinental</i>
<i> railroad</i>

33:58.750 --> 34:02.041
<i> and kept a divided country</i>
<i> together.</i>

34:06.375 --> 34:10.250
<i> But when Hayes</i>
<i> finally takes office in 1877,</i>

34:10.250 --> 34:13.417
<i> he inherits a country</i>
<i> with numerous problems.</i>

34:15.500 --> 34:17.375
Eisenbach:
<i> Rutherford B. Hayes</i>
<i> comes in</i>

34:17.375 --> 34:21.041
and it is, to say the least,
a controversial election.

34:21.041 --> 34:24.125
<i> Half the country doesn't think</i>
<i> he's the rightful president</i>

34:24.125 --> 34:27.125
<i> and he's dealing</i>
<i> with the economic crisis</i>

34:27.125 --> 34:29.083
<i> coming off</i>
<i> the Panic of 1873,</i>

34:29.083 --> 34:31.125
<i> the greatest depression</i>
<i> in American history</i>

34:31.125 --> 34:32.542
<i> up to that point,</i>

34:32.542 --> 34:36.041
and he still has to
avenge the death of Custer

34:36.041 --> 34:38.250
<i> by getting Crazy Horse.</i>

34:38.250 --> 34:40.834
Sherman:
<i> So I know you're familiar</i>
<i> with our present situation</i>

34:40.834 --> 34:43.291
with the Sioux.
It's pervasive.

34:45.583 --> 34:48.208
Gentlemen,
we've got to fix this.

34:50.375 --> 34:52.709
Narrator:
<i> After the army's</i>
<i> embarrassing defeat</i>

34:52.709 --> 34:54.250
<i> at Little Bighorn,</i>

34:54.250 --> 34:56.417
<i> Hayes is under pressure</i>
<i> to ramp up</i>

34:56.417 --> 34:59.208
<i> military efforts</i>
<i> against the Indians,</i>

34:59.208 --> 35:01.250
<i> and General</i>
<i> William Tecumseh Sherman</i>

35:01.250 --> 35:05.125
<i> sees the opportunity</i>
<i> he's been waiting for.</i>

35:05.125 --> 35:07.583
We deploy 1,200 troops here

35:07.583 --> 35:10.166
and about 240 miles
to the west here.

35:10.166 --> 35:11.583
<i> Then we wipe Crazy Horse</i>

35:11.583 --> 35:13.625
<i> and Sitting Bull's</i>
<i> war party out.</i>

35:17.709 --> 35:20.709
All resources are put
into defeating the Indians.

35:22.625 --> 35:25.750
The debate
over the peace policy is over.

35:27.583 --> 35:29.709
<i> It's a war policy</i>
<i> from now on.</i>

35:29.709 --> 35:32.166
<i> The natives are going</i>
<i> to be totally subjugated.</i>

35:42.625 --> 35:45.166
Narrator:
<i> But Sherman has a plan</i>
<i> that he believes</i>

35:45.166 --> 35:49.291
<i> will not only defeat</i>
<i>the Indians on the battlefield,</i>

35:49.291 --> 35:53.625
<i> but could forever alter</i>
<i> their way of life.</i>

36:09.583 --> 36:13.417
Narrator:
<i> To defeat the Lakota Sioux</i>
<i> once and for all,</i>

36:13.417 --> 36:17.542
<i> General William T. Sherman</i>
<i> looks to a brutal tactic</i>

36:17.542 --> 36:20.125
<i> he used during</i>
<i> the Civil War...</i>

36:20.125 --> 36:22.125
<i> ( cannonfire echoes )</i>

36:22.125 --> 36:24.792
<i> ( soldiers' voices echo )</i>

36:34.166 --> 36:36.625
Narrator:
<i> ...a policy called</i>
<i> "Total Warfare."</i>

36:45.625 --> 36:48.625
<i> During his march</i>
<i> across Georgia,</i>

36:48.625 --> 36:51.750
<i> Sherman's troops</i>
<i> torched 300 miles</i>

36:51.750 --> 36:55.333
<i> of civilian homes,</i>
<i> farms, and livestock.</i>

36:58.917 --> 37:01.917
John McCain:
<i> General William Tecumseh</i>
<i> Sherman was ruthless.</i>

37:04.458 --> 37:06.917
He realized that
he had to cut the heart
out of the South.

37:09.500 --> 37:11.834
<i> He had to stop</i>
<i> their base from functioning</i>

37:11.834 --> 37:14.625
so the armies
would be starved.

37:16.834 --> 37:19.458
<i> It was terrible</i>
<i> what he did.</i>

37:19.458 --> 37:21.417
Very successful,

37:21.417 --> 37:24.709
but, honestly...
ruthless.

37:31.250 --> 37:34.417
Narrator:
<i> Sherman knows he can apply</i>
<i> a similar tactic</i>

37:34.417 --> 37:39.542
<i> to defeat the Indians</i>
<i> that will guarantee victory,</i>

37:39.542 --> 37:42.875
<i> destroying something essential</i>
<i> to their survival--</i>

37:44.709 --> 37:47.291
<i> the buffalo.</i>

37:56.542 --> 37:58.917
<i> At their peak,</i>
<i> tens of millions of buffalo</i>

37:58.917 --> 38:02.875
<i> roamed the plains</i>
<i> from Canada to New Mexico.</i>

38:08.333 --> 38:10.583
<i> For tribes</i>
<i> like the Lakota,</i>

38:10.583 --> 38:13.583
<i> the buffalo are critical</i>
<i> to their survival.</i>

38:16.375 --> 38:17.917
Pourier:
<i> The buffalo was our life.</i>

38:17.917 --> 38:20.959
We used every part of
the buffalo, nothing was wasted.

38:20.959 --> 38:25.250
<i> We used the bones, the hide</i>
<i> and, of course, the meat.</i>

38:25.250 --> 38:29.333
<i> The internal organs</i>
<i> we used for strings and bags.</i>

38:29.333 --> 38:31.333
We always lived
around the buffalo.

38:31.333 --> 38:33.709
I mean, wherever they went,
that's where we went.

38:40.709 --> 38:42.417
Narrator:
<i> The U.S. military</i>

38:42.417 --> 38:45.250
<i> encourages Eastern hunters</i>
<i> to travel west,</i>

38:45.250 --> 38:50.291
<i> providing them with shelter,</i>
<i> protection, and ammunition.</i>

38:50.291 --> 38:52.667
<i> Enticed by the army's offer </i>

38:52.667 --> 38:56.500
<i> and the opportunity</i>
<i> to make up to $700 a day,</i>

38:56.500 --> 39:00.625
<i> the hunters massacre</i>
<i> entire herds of buffalo--</i>

39:00.625 --> 39:03.458
<i> all in a plot</i>
<i> to starve the Indians.</i>

39:08.875 --> 39:10.750
Jacoby:
<i> White hunters come out</i>
<i> and just kill buffalo,</i>

39:10.750 --> 39:12.500
<i> kill as many as they can.</i>

39:12.500 --> 39:14.333
There's stories of
the single white hunter

39:14.333 --> 39:16.542
killing maybe 5,000 buffalo
in a season--

39:16.542 --> 39:17.709
<i> very large numbers.</i>

39:20.041 --> 39:22.834
Narrator:
<i> As the hunt expands,</i>
<i> railroad companies</i>

39:22.834 --> 39:26.041
<i> begin to promote</i>
<i> the buffalo's extermination,</i>

39:26.041 --> 39:29.583
<i> offering "hunting by rail"</i>
<i> expeditions,</i>

39:29.583 --> 39:33.417
<i> where men shoot the animals</i>
<i> from moving trains.</i>

39:35.667 --> 39:37.375
<i> Some men become celebrities</i>

39:37.375 --> 39:39.959
<i> by the sheer number</i>
<i> of buffalo they kill,</i>

39:39.959 --> 39:43.375
<i> including hunter</i>
<i> William Cody,</i>

39:43.375 --> 39:47.417
<i> who takes down 4,000 buffalo</i>
<i> in 18 months...</i>

39:50.792 --> 39:53.834
<i> earning the nickname</i>
<i> "Buffalo Bill."</i>

40:01.667 --> 40:05.417
<i> By 1877,</i>
<i> the buffalo's population,</i>

40:05.417 --> 40:07.750
<i> once estimated at 60 million,</i>

40:07.750 --> 40:10.709
<i> plummets to below 2,000.</i>

40:12.500 --> 40:14.375
Pourier:
<i> I really believe</i>
<i> that was planned</i>

40:14.375 --> 40:17.542
to help exterminate us.

40:17.542 --> 40:20.458
<i> Because once they took</i>
<i> the buffalo from us,</i>

40:20.458 --> 40:23.625
they took
our way of life.

40:23.625 --> 40:26.417
Anne Collier:
<i> The American government policy</i>
<i> to eradicate the buffalo</i>

40:26.417 --> 40:28.917
<i> was no better</i>
<i> than genocide.</i>

40:28.917 --> 40:32.458
It was a matter
of psychological warfare.

40:32.458 --> 40:35.000
If you eradicate the buffalo,
you eradicate the Indian.

40:48.417 --> 40:50.917
( speaking Lakota language )

41:38.959 --> 41:41.792
Narrator:
<i> Lakota leaders</i>
<i> Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull</i>

41:41.792 --> 41:44.667
<i> face a difficult decision--</i>

41:44.667 --> 41:47.709
<i> stay in the Great Plains</i>
<i> and fight</i>

41:47.709 --> 41:53.709
<i> or move their people</i>
<i> away from everything</i>
<i> they've ever known.</i>

41:53.709 --> 41:56.001
Pourier:
<i> These men were hunters,</i>
<i> they were fighters,</i>

41:56.001 --> 41:58.125
<i> they were providers.</i>

41:58.125 --> 42:01.917
<i> They had pride,</i>
<i> they had strong spirits.</i>

42:01.917 --> 42:04.083
Everything they did
at that point

42:04.083 --> 42:05.917
was just to stay alive.

42:08.458 --> 42:10.875
Narrator:
<i> As the Indians fight</i>
<i> for survival,</i>

42:10.875 --> 42:14.000
<i> over 750 miles away,</i>

42:14.000 --> 42:17.667
<i> a new breed of outlaw</i>
<i> is about to emerge...</i>

42:20.834 --> 42:25.500
<i> including an unknown</i>
<i> teenage cattle thief</i>

42:25.500 --> 42:28.542
<i> who will soon become</i>
<i> the most wanted man</i>

42:28.542 --> 42:31.125
<i> in the West.</i>
