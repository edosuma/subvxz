We have to go outside.

01:39.533 --> 01:41.535
What's the matter, baby?

02:13.500 --> 02:16.242
OK, sweetheart, go check in the house,
see if she's in there.

02:25.612 --> 02:30.459
Megan!

02:38.358 --> 02:41.168
When's she gonna get back?

02:41.261 --> 02:43.502
Oh, buddy, she's gonna come back.

02:43.597 --> 02:45.702
You know, we'll put some, uh...

02:45.799 --> 02:48.507
...some water in her bowl,
you know, and some food.

02:48.602 --> 02:51.378
She's gonna get hungry. She's gonna
have to come back to eat, right?

02:53.273 --> 02:56.379
I'm hungry right now. Are you hungry?

02:56.943 --> 02:57.944
Mm-hmm.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.491
You know, I'm so hungry,
I could just eat your hand.

03:01.782 --> 03:04.490
Yeah. No, no, just let me
have a bite of your hand, OK?

03:04.551 --> 03:06.462
Just one bite.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.830
How come I can't have one bite?

03:08.889 --> 03:10.027
Just one finger.

03:10.123 --> 03:12.125
- No!
- You've got five of them.

03:14.628 --> 03:17.472
OK, we got to be quiet
when we wake up Mommy, OK?

03:18.565 --> 03:21.409
Do you want to get
thrown or do you want to get dropped?

03:21.501 --> 03:24.004
I want to get next to Mommy.

03:25.138 --> 03:29.052
...I'm gonna go on to Mommy,
then jump on the pillow,

03:34.147 --> 03:35.649
No, no!

03:35.716 --> 03:37.161
We're tigers!

03:37.651 --> 03:39.995
I'm sleeping! Stop!

03:41.922 --> 03:44.163
- it's too early.
- We're tigers!

03:44.224 --> 03:45.726
- No.
- Yes.

03:46.993 --> 03:49.166
Stop, stop. Stop.
Come on, I get to sleep in more.

03:56.036 --> 03:58.539
No, make pretty music.

03:59.606 --> 04:01.916
I must get my breakfast.

04:29.035 --> 04:31.447
Here comes your oatmeal.
All right, picky.

04:31.538 --> 04:33.609
That's beautiful. You ready to eat?

04:33.707 --> 04:36.745
You gotta eat up, OK?
You can't be late today.

04:37.544 --> 04:38.921
Blow on it first.

04:41.948 --> 04:44.451
- I don't like it.
- Why don't you like it?

04:44.551 --> 04:47.430
It just yucky. Aah!

04:47.788 --> 04:50.234
Baby, what did you do?
You just put water in that?

04:50.891 --> 04:54.896
- Yeah, it's instant oatmeal.
- Yeah, but you've got to soak the oats.

04:54.961 --> 04:57.271
- They're fine.
- Yeah, it's delicious, you eat it.

04:57.330 --> 04:59.810
Here, come on, let's eat like leopards.
That'll make it better.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.141
Here, just eat the raisins OK?
At least.

05:07.974 --> 05:10.181
Oh, come on. Dean, I don't
need to clean up after two kids.

05:10.277 --> 05:12.018
Frankie, Frankie...

05:13.079 --> 05:15.150
- Use a spoon, honey.
- What do you mean, use a spoon?

05:15.248 --> 05:16.784
Come on, use a spoon.
You know how to use a spoon.

05:16.850 --> 05:19.490
We're eating like leopards.
Hey, that's mine!

05:19.586 --> 05:21.327
Show your daddy how you use a spoon.

05:21.421 --> 05:23.458
You're a big girl now, huh?
You know how to use a spoon.

05:23.523 --> 05:24.797
What do you mean
you're a big girl?

05:24.858 --> 05:27.464
You're a big girl now, sweetheart,
so don't have any fun.

05:27.527 --> 05:28.505
Stick it on your face.

05:28.595 --> 05:30.268
Frankie,
we're leaving in two minutes.

05:32.098 --> 05:33.941
Come on, don't eat like that, come on.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.277
Come on, come on, If that's the way
you're gonna eat, breakfast is over.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.975
No! Dad was doing it!

05:39.039 --> 05:41.178
I know your dad was doing it.
Come on, kiddo.

05:41.274 --> 05:42.947
- I was doing it!
- Daddy,

05:43.009 --> 05:45.011
- you made me in trouble!
- I'm sorry.

05:45.111 --> 05:47.148
Let's go, let's go.
We're late, we're late. Come on.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.786
You wanna wear this one?

05:51.351 --> 05:53.831
- Yes,
- OK, but you have to be fast.

05:53.887 --> 05:55.889
Ready? One...

05:55.989 --> 05:58.993

...five... six...

06:02.629 --> 06:04.199
...seven... We're gonna do it.

06:04.297 --> 06:07.676
Eight! You did it in eight!

06:10.570 --> 06:12.641
Whoopsies!

06:12.706 --> 06:14.481
Silly Mommy.

06:14.541 --> 06:17.317
Hey, Frankie, you gonna be good
for Ms. Alex today?

06:17.911 --> 06:19.822
You promise?

06:19.880 --> 06:23.225
- OK, I love you like crazy.
- I love you like crazy!

06:23.316 --> 06:26.058
Oh, really?
'Cause I love you like crazy!

06:26.152 --> 06:28.189
OK, guys, we gotta go.
We're gonna be late.

06:29.489 --> 06:31.992
See you at the recital, Daddy!

06:32.726 --> 06:34.763
Hey, Cin, put your seat belt on.

06:36.429 --> 06:40.241
- Hey, Cindy, put your seat belt on.
- I got it.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.370
Would you please put your seat belt on?

06:42.435 --> 06:44.108
This road is crazy, all right?

06:45.005 --> 06:48.680
Watch out for this guy.
Watch out for this fucking asshole.

06:49.943 --> 06:52.253
Hey, fuck you! Why don't you
slow down, you fucking jackass!

06:53.179 --> 06:54.522
Motherfucker!

06:56.116 --> 06:57.754
You'll fucking kill somebody, asshole!

07:02.289 --> 07:05.759
See this folder he gave me?
Yeah, I know.

07:07.694 --> 07:10.231
- Hey, there you are.
- Oh, hi.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.539
Sorry, I'm almost done here.

07:12.966 --> 07:14.411
Did you get a...
Do you have a second?

07:14.467 --> 07:16.743
- Yeah, sure.
- Did you get a chance to talk it over

07:16.803 --> 07:22.810
- with your family yet?
- No, I mean, you know, I will. I will.

07:23.376 --> 07:25.117
That's OK.

07:25.211 --> 07:27.088
No pressure, it's just, you know,
it's just a good opportunity,

07:27.147 --> 07:28.649
I'll know for sure by Monday.

07:28.748 --> 07:31.285
By Monday? All right. I've got to have
my best nurse up there with me.

07:31.384 --> 07:33.625
- Your first baby?
- So exciting,

07:33.720 --> 07:36.792
Yeah, I know, isn't it?
Do you know what you're having yet?

07:36.890 --> 07:38.631
- No.
- No?

07:38.725 --> 07:41.001
Do you want to know
or are you going to wait for a surprise?

07:41.094 --> 07:43.131
- We want to know.
- You want to know, Yeah.

07:43.229 --> 07:45.175
- Having the baby is surprise enough.
- Yes.

07:45.265 --> 07:48.576
Let's see... it's a girl.

07:48.668 --> 07:49.840
Is that good news?

07:49.936 --> 07:51.472
- it's great news.
- Oh, good.

07:53.506 --> 07:55.281
...but it should
clear up by the afternoon.

07:55.342 --> 07:59.654
This not gonna interfere
with your July Fourth plans...

07:59.746 --> 08:02.488
...clear skies for the
fireworks tomorrow night.

08:02.582 --> 08:04.493
And remember to dress warm, folks...

08:39.619 --> 08:41.063
Fuck.

09:54.060 --> 09:55.266
Excuse me.

10:17.383 --> 10:19.056
OK, we have one more song left.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.963
My Country, 'Tis of Thee.
It will be acapella.

10:22.055 --> 10:23.466
What's wrong?

10:23.723 --> 10:26.499
- You ready, ladies and gentlemen?
- Yes.

10:27.393 --> 10:30.567
- I found Megan.
- ...five, six, ready, sing.

10:42.475 --> 10:46.787
How many times did I tell you
to lock the fucking gate? Huh?

11:05.665 --> 11:07.611
Hey, I had an idea...

11:08.268 --> 11:11.374
I thought maybe you should
go visit your grandpa today.

11:11.471 --> 11:14.611
- What do you think?
- Yeah!

11:15.108 --> 11:16.781
Did you ind Megan?

11:20.813 --> 11:22.520
No.

11:22.615 --> 11:25.357
But I was thinking maybe
she moved out to Hollywood,

11:25.451 --> 11:27.658
and she became a movie dog.

11:28.955 --> 11:32.869
You think? You think she moved out
to Hollywood to be a movie dog?

11:34.294 --> 11:38.140
She had the looks, don't you think?
Maybe that's what happened, huh?

11:49.976 --> 11:54.925
- Pa!
- Hi, sweetheart, how are you?

11:55.014 --> 11:57.893
Here, look what I have for you.
Look at this.

12:02.388 --> 12:04.095
Want me to show you a magic trick?

12:04.190 --> 12:05.430
You coming up?

12:07.227 --> 12:09.707
I can't smoke around the oxygen tank.

12:12.765 --> 12:14.438
- Oh!

12:17.003 --> 12:18.710
- Honey?
- Hi, Gypsy.

12:18.771 --> 12:20.842
Honey, go say bye-bye to Daddy, OK?

12:20.907 --> 12:22.716
You're not gonna
see him until tomorrow.

12:22.775 --> 12:25.949
Watch out for the water. Oh!
OK, go, you're clear!

12:27.347 --> 12:29.349
- Bye, Dad!
- Bye, buddy.

12:31.684 --> 12:34.756
Hey, I love you.

12:34.854 --> 12:37.095
- I love you.
- Have fun, OK, buddy?

12:37.523 --> 12:38.524
OK.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.434
You remember what to do
when Pa snores, right?

12:40.526 --> 12:43.735
- Cover his mouth and hold his nose.
- That's my girl,

12:43.796 --> 12:45.571
OK, go have fun.

12:45.632 --> 12:47.634
All right, run to Mama!

12:47.734 --> 12:50.476
Come on, you can do it!
Come on, sweetie pie.

12:50.970 --> 12:52.779
Yay, that was great.

12:53.706 --> 12:56.312
That was great.
All right, you ready to go inside?

12:57.377 --> 12:59.755
So what's with him,
you two fighting again?

12:59.812 --> 13:01.257
We'll talk about it later.

13:01.314 --> 13:02.884
Why isn't Daddy
gonna come in?

13:02.982 --> 13:03.983
I don't know.

13:27.073 --> 13:29.747
- Mr. Benatti, good to meet you.
- Have a seat.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.982
What kind of job are you applying for?

13:32.078 --> 13:35.525
- Driver? Helper? Packer?
- Whatever, one that pays.

13:35.615 --> 13:37.617
- Do you have any experience at all?
- Sure.

13:38.351 --> 13:39.796
Where have you worked?

13:39.852 --> 13:41.991
I mean, you know,
I've helped people move before.

13:42.088 --> 13:43.465
You mean, what are my jobs?

13:43.523 --> 13:44.797
But you've never worked
for a moving company?

13:44.857 --> 13:45.995
No.

13:46.092 --> 13:49.164
OK, so that would be "no experience."
Where are you from?

13:49.262 --> 13:51.105
- Florida.
- And how long have you been here?

13:51.164 --> 13:53.337
- Like two years.
- And where are you living?

13:53.433 --> 13:56.346
- I live in Brooklyn.
- Can you get here every day?

13:56.436 --> 13:59.007
- Yeah, I'll get here.
- I need you here by 7:00am.

13:59.105 --> 14:00.345
I'll get here.

14:00.440 --> 14:01.680
- Ready?
- Yeah.

14:01.774 --> 14:03.845
- Hold it. There you go.
- All right, Marshall

14:03.943 --> 14:07.186
- Good job!
- You're a man amongst men. No homo!

14:08.614 --> 14:10.321
Sit up, son! Sit up, sit up!

14:13.953 --> 14:17.696
Don't worry about it. You ain't
a professional yet, that's all.

14:19.292 --> 14:20.669
How do you meet girls?

14:20.793 --> 14:22.704
I just walk up,
talk to them.

14:22.795 --> 14:24.832
Whatever comes in my mind
at that moment.

14:24.897 --> 14:26.535
- He honks the horn.
- I gets out of the truck.

14:26.632 --> 14:28.543
I get out the truck and talk to 'em.

14:28.634 --> 14:30.477
Or he screams out,
like, "chocolate thunder."

14:33.473 --> 14:36.511
See, I don't know. I feel like
men are more romantic than women.

14:36.576 --> 14:38.749
When we get married,
we marry, like, one girl.

14:38.845 --> 14:42.725
'Cause we're resistant the whole way,
until we meet one girl and we think,

14:42.815 --> 14:45.557
"I'd be an idiot if I didn't marry
this girl, she's so great."

14:45.651 --> 14:48.564
But it seems like girls get
to a place, they just kinda pick,

14:48.654 --> 14:50.156
pick the best option or something.

14:50.223 --> 14:53.067
I know girls that get married, they're
like, "Oh, he's got a good job."

14:53.159 --> 14:55.400
I mean, they spend their whole life
looking for Prince Charming,

14:55.495 --> 14:57.941
and then they... then they marry,
they marry the guy

14:58.030 --> 15:00.738
that's got a good job
and who's gonna stick around.

15:00.833 --> 15:03.109
Take your share and go home,
OK? Let's call it a good night.

15:03.202 --> 15:04.408
Thanks, Jamie.

15:39.272 --> 15:42.276
Lemme tell you something.
When I get old, I'm gonna look good.

15:42.375 --> 15:43.786
When you get old,
you're gonna look like him.

15:43.876 --> 15:45.549
What do you mean "when" you get old?

15:45.611 --> 15:47.955
It's gonna be a long time,
another 50 years.

15:49.215 --> 15:52.128
Damn, it look like
World War Ill in this motherfucker.

15:52.218 --> 15:55.290
OK, look, box everything in
the kitchen, bag everything upstairs.

15:55.388 --> 15:58.562
Let's get this truck loaded,
up to Pennsylvania and back by tonight.

16:34.293 --> 16:37.274
- This is a small, small room here.
- Here we go.

16:38.931 --> 16:41.002
How's all the stuff gonna it in here?

16:41.100 --> 16:43.011
It's probably not gonna,
so strip the furniture.

16:43.102 --> 16:45.548
OK, I'll bring you boxes,
you start unpacking, placing.

16:45.638 --> 16:47.845
Flatten all the cartons,
we'll get 'em outta here.

16:47.940 --> 16:50.386
- What happens to all the other stuff?
- Not our problem.

17:12.131 --> 17:14.474
Come on, come on,
speed it up, speed it up.

17:17.904 --> 17:21.146
Gotta go. We gotta go. We gotta go.

17:21.207 --> 17:22.310
I don't understand
what you're trying to say.

17:22.375 --> 17:25.878
We gotta go.
We got another job to do, we gotta go.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.425
Dean, you ready?
Let's get outta here, OK?

17:30.516 --> 17:32.655
Job's over, here.
I'll give you your pay.

17:32.718 --> 17:34.356
- One hundred...
- Damn.

17:34.420 --> 17:37.890
One hundred and ten...
and 20 is part of your tip, OK?

17:37.990 --> 17:40.664
Let's go, we've got
a two-hour ride back to the city.

17:42.929 --> 17:44.567
Walter!

17:44.664 --> 17:48.111
OK... Don't be mad.

17:49.335 --> 17:51.542
I hung some of your stuff,
I hope it's OK.

17:51.604 --> 17:54.915
You wanna walk in here?
You don't wanna get wheeled in here.

17:55.007 --> 17:56.509
This is your new house.

17:57.510 --> 17:59.717
I hung your uniform. I hope that's OK.

17:59.779 --> 18:02.282
It's just so handsome, you know?

18:07.853 --> 18:10.595
I noticed you had a lot of matches,
so I stuck 'em on the wall.

18:10.690 --> 18:13.534
If you don't like it, you can
just take 'em down. it's tape.

18:15.695 --> 18:17.368
Do you wanna sit down in the chair?

18:17.430 --> 18:19.410
- OK.
- Please.

18:19.465 --> 18:22.275
Here, let me get this out of your way.

18:23.869 --> 18:25.405
You got it?

18:25.471 --> 18:27.041
OK, Walter,
I'm gonna get in trouble, I gotta go,

18:27.106 --> 18:30.747
but I'm gonna show you a few things, GK?
That's your shoes, see?

18:30.810 --> 18:33.484
- Hey, Dean we gotta go, all right?
- Yo. OK.

18:33.579 --> 18:35.320
- I'll meet you in the truck.
- OK.

18:36.616 --> 18:40.792
And... He's not the boss of me,
by the way. What else?

18:40.886 --> 18:44.390
All your stuff's in here.
That's your pants, sweaters, shirts.

18:44.457 --> 18:47.461
Hey, Walter, is this your wife?
Is this you and your wife?

18:50.329 --> 18:52.070
She was a beautiful woman.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.668
OK, nice to meet ya.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.273
- Thank you.
- Good luck here.

18:59.138 --> 19:02.517
OK. I'll see ya down the road.

19:32.138 --> 19:33.481
- I'm sorry.

19:35.941 --> 19:37.284
I know.

19:42.848 --> 19:44.623
Don't be sorry, baby.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.833
Oh, fuck.

19:51.123 --> 19:52.796
I'm just tired, you know.

20:00.299 --> 20:02.074
I'm just fucking tired.

20:03.235 --> 20:04.714
Come he-re, boy!

20:08.074 --> 20:10.384
Maybe it's because we didn't
make it comfy enough in there.

20:12.311 --> 20:14.552
Maybe we made it too girly.

20:15.181 --> 20:18.390
- Too girly?
- Yeah.

20:19.485 --> 20:24.696
Well, I think it...
Maybe we just need to put something...

20:24.757 --> 20:27.897
...like a nice blanket
in there for him to lay on.

20:27.993 --> 20:29.836
- OK.
- You think that's a good idea?

20:29.895 --> 20:32.068
- Yeah, let's get a blanket.
- OK, buddy.

20:32.164 --> 20:35.373
But don't take
the one I usually do.

20:35.434 --> 20:38.074
OK you better ask your mom
which blanket's OK to use,

20:38.170 --> 20:40.411
because I don't want to get in trouble.

20:40.506 --> 20:44.249
- OK. Will you open this up?
- Watch your hands.

20:44.343 --> 20:47.688
But close it quickly,
'cause the dog is in there.

20:48.681 --> 20:50.024
Can you take the trash out?

20:50.082 --> 20:52.460
Yeah. Baby, do you know
where we put that."

20:55.755 --> 20:57.132
I got an idea.

21:00.860 --> 21:03.067
Hello?

21:03.129 --> 21:06.372
I'm calling to see if I can make
a reservation for tonight.

21:06.432 --> 21:09.811
- I have a gift certificate.
- No.

21:09.902 --> 21:11.575
What's our options?

21:12.972 --> 21:16.943
They have Cupid's Cove room available.

21:17.042 --> 21:19.955
I'm not going to some cheesy sex motel.
I'm on call tomorrow.

21:20.045 --> 21:21.820
What else? That's it?

21:22.648 --> 21:24.992
Oh, and there's a Future Room.
Can you hold on one second?

21:25.084 --> 21:28.293
- Baby, will you make the decision?
- I'm on call, I can't go.

21:28.387 --> 21:29.457
Baby, please.

21:29.555 --> 21:31.000
- Listen to me for a second.
- What do you want me to say?

21:31.090 --> 21:34.094
Can you hold on one second?
Listen to me for a second.

21:34.160 --> 21:36.436
Would you stop cleaning for one minute?

21:36.495 --> 21:39.442
- What?
- I'm asking you. Please.

21:39.498 --> 21:43.071
Let's get outta here.
We gotta get outta here.

21:45.104 --> 21:47.675
Baby, we have to get out of this house.

21:47.773 --> 21:50.083
Let's go get drunk and make love.

21:53.646 --> 21:57.321
- Now, do you want the Cupid's Cove...
- Dean, I don't wanna...

21:57.416 --> 22:00.522
...or do you want the Future Room?

22:01.320 --> 22:03.357
Make a decision, baby, please.

22:03.455 --> 22:06.163
I don't want to get in the car
at 7:30 and drive for two hours.

22:06.258 --> 22:10.604
OK. I'll make the decision.
The Future Room.

22:12.264 --> 22:13.834
For two.

22:16.669 --> 22:19.047
- Periera.
- You're crazy.

22:20.472 --> 22:21.815
Thanks.

22:29.281 --> 22:31.818
Pack your bags, baby,
we're going to the future.

22:42.628 --> 22:45.871
Oh, my God.
ls that Cindy Heller?

22:49.001 --> 22:53.711
- Bobby Ontario?
- How are you?

22:53.806 --> 22:58.255
- I'm good, How are you?
- I'm... you know, I'm hanging in there.

22:58.344 --> 23:02.349
Wow. Wow. it's been a while.

23:08.153 --> 23:10.030
- How about you?
- Yeah, here.

23:10.089 --> 23:13.332
Here. Been here,
stayed here, never left here.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.531
Here's good, here's good.

23:16.595 --> 23:18.074
- Married?
- Married.

23:18.163 --> 23:21.110
- Married.
- That's crazy. Lucky guy.

23:22.501 --> 23:26.176
Have you been faithful to him?

23:28.841 --> 23:32.550
That's a strange question to ask
somebody you haven't seen in forever.

23:32.611 --> 23:34.249
Yeah, well, you know...

23:34.346 --> 23:36.053
- Seriously.
- Yes.

23:36.115 --> 23:37.753
Yes you have, or yes you haven't'?

23:37.850 --> 23:40.456
Yes... I have, I mean, I have...
I have been...

23:42.721 --> 23:44.894
Why are you looking at me like that?

23:46.725 --> 23:48.864
I'm not looking at you like anything.

23:49.528 --> 23:50.939
Oh, OK.

23:53.399 --> 23:55.208
- Yeah.
- Uh.

24:03.142 --> 24:04.621
Come on, let's go.

24:06.445 --> 24:07.719
Let's go.

24:15.220 --> 24:16.893
What you thinking?

24:20.392 --> 24:22.065
What's on your mind?

24:26.231 --> 24:29.075
You're never gonna guess
who I saw at the liquor man.

24:30.302 --> 24:34.512
- Richard Grieco?
- No, but good guess.

24:36.342 --> 24:38.481
Jon Bon Jovi.

24:39.445 --> 24:41.118
Bobby Ontario.

24:54.927 --> 24:57.373
What the fuck was he doing there?

24:57.463 --> 25:00.342
I don't know...
I mean, buying liquor, I guess.

25:03.602 --> 25:05.445
Jesus.

25:05.504 --> 25:08.815
- How come you're just telling me now?
- 'Cause I'm telling you now.

25:08.874 --> 25:11.286
How come you didn't tell me
when we were there?

25:11.343 --> 25:14.347
I don't know, 'cause I was flustered
and I'm telling you now.

25:14.446 --> 25:16.357
- You talked to him?
- No. I mean like,

25:16.448 --> 25:20.191
- "Hi, bye, how are you..."
- How are you?

25:20.285 --> 25:24.791
- Yeah, he asked me how I was.
- And you told him?

25:24.857 --> 25:28.202
I mean, I didn't want to,
but we were stuck there.

25:28.293 --> 25:31.297
We were in the same store,
buying things together at the same time.

25:33.799 --> 25:38.339
I wish you'd seen him. I wish you'd...
You wouldn't feel so bad. He's fat...

25:38.404 --> 25:40.213
- What do I care?
- I don't know.

25:40.305 --> 25:42.046
What do I care if he's fat or not?

25:44.576 --> 25:46.647
What does that mean?
Make me feel better?

25:46.712 --> 25:48.658
I don't know. 'Cause he's a loser.

25:50.382 --> 25:52.726
What does that have to do with me?

25:52.818 --> 25:55.594
Whether he's a loser or he's fat or not?
What the fuck do I care?

25:55.687 --> 25:57.098
I don't... What!?

25:57.189 --> 26:02.901
What are you saying that for? That
would make me feel better, he's fat?

26:02.995 --> 26:06.033
So what? If he was in good shape,
I shouldn't feel good?

26:06.098 --> 26:08.169
I said the wrong thing.
I'm nervous, OK?

26:08.767 --> 26:12.840
- What do you mean you're nervous?
- I feel funny, because you feel funny.

26:15.507 --> 26:17.453
You're nervous 'cause I feel funny?

26:19.344 --> 26:21.017
- What does that mean?
- I feel like I said the wrong thing.

26:21.080 --> 26:23.390
I feel like I shouldn't have
said anything.

26:24.450 --> 26:26.361
Really? That's an option?

26:27.686 --> 26:31.566
You run into Bobby Ontario
and it's an option not to tell me?

26:32.791 --> 26:35.271
I feel like you're upset,
and I upset you and I'm sorry.

26:35.360 --> 26:37.067
And I said the wrong thing.

26:38.230 --> 26:40.938
Baby... you can do whatever you want.

26:43.035 --> 26:44.378
OK.

26:48.273 --> 26:50.310
I'm sorry.

26:59.551 --> 27:01.053
Fuck.

27:02.454 --> 27:05.628
- What are you doing?
- I gotta pee,

27:05.724 --> 27:08.170
- Where, in this person's house?
- Fuck you,

27:08.260 --> 27:09.796
Fuck me.

28:33.145 --> 28:34.488
Hi.

28:36.815 --> 28:39.853
- What are you doing?
- Research.

28:40.586 --> 28:43.658
Really, research.

28:44.489 --> 28:47.698
So what, I mean,
you're supposed to be a quadriplegic?

28:48.694 --> 28:51.573
No, quads can't use their arms.
I'm a paraplegic.

28:52.998 --> 28:54.500
Really?

28:58.170 --> 28:59.376
Hi.

29:02.274 --> 29:06.245
Why do you have to act like
such a freak all the time, huh? Huh?

29:06.845 --> 29:08.188
Come over.

29:10.249 --> 29:11.557
- Come on.
- I can't.

29:11.617 --> 29:13.858
- I can't.
- You know you want it.

29:13.919 --> 29:16.024
I gotta go get Gramma.

29:17.055 --> 29:18.625
I just came to say hi.

29:22.394 --> 29:25.739
- Call you later.
- Yeah. Whatever!

29:28.133 --> 29:31.273
- Oh! I thought you were Dad.
- Just us.

29:31.370 --> 29:35.250
- How was the beauty parlor?
- Oh, lovely, just lovely.

29:35.307 --> 29:36.615
Good.

29:37.542 --> 29:39.954
What did it feel like
when you fell in love?

29:41.580 --> 29:42.888
Ooh...

29:45.917 --> 29:47.294
Oh, dear.

29:49.321 --> 29:50.959
I don't think I found it.

29:51.723 --> 29:53.634
Even with Grandpa?

29:55.060 --> 29:57.768
Maybe a little in the beginning.

29:57.829 --> 30:00.901
Bless us, O Lord, for these, thy gifts
which we are about to receive...

30:00.966 --> 30:05.437
He didn't really have
any regard for me as a person.

30:05.504 --> 30:07.780
You've gotta be careful of that.

30:07.839 --> 30:11.753
You've gotta be careful that
the person that you fall in love...

30:13.612 --> 30:15.614
...is worth it to you.

30:17.449 --> 30:20.259
I don't ever want
to be like my parents.

30:20.319 --> 30:23.857
I know that they must have loved
each other at one time, right?

30:23.955 --> 30:27.425
Did they just get it all out of the way
before they had me?

30:27.492 --> 30:29.802
We're supposed to
eat this garbage?

30:32.764 --> 30:34.141
Huh'?!

30:35.267 --> 30:36.769
I'm sorry.

30:37.302 --> 30:39.942
- Do you want me to make you some eggs?
- No!

30:41.673 --> 30:45.018
I want you to enjoy
your goddamned dinner!

30:47.546 --> 30:51.323
How do you trust your feelings
when they can just disappear like that?

30:53.985 --> 30:59.731
I think the only way you can
find out is... to have the feeling.

31:01.460 --> 31:03.337
You're a good person, honey.

31:04.796 --> 31:07.902
I think you have the right to say,
"Yes, I do trust."

31:08.800 --> 31:10.802
"I trust myself"

31:40.265 --> 31:43.337
- What?

31:44.703 --> 31:46.011
What, what?

31:47.005 --> 31:48.848
- Fuck!
- Shit.

31:52.878 --> 31:54.687
- Fuck!
- Sorry.

32:32.551 --> 32:35.725
"Somehow, she didn't want to
confess to him that she was still wary

32:35.787 --> 32:38.461
of all those people who'd
seemed to want to cane about hen

32:39.558 --> 32:42.266
He touched her cheek gently,
caressing her.

32:43.762 --> 32:47.073
Her heart was beating so loudly
that surely he could hear it."

32:47.132 --> 32:48.634
Arms up.

32:48.733 --> 32:50.144
"He smoothed her hair back,

32:50.235 --> 32:53.739
the touch of his fingers sending
waves of awareness through hen

32:53.805 --> 32:56.979
He was going to kiss hen
That was what she wanted, wasn't it?

32:57.075 --> 33:00.579
So why did she feel as if she trembled
on the edge of a precipice,

33:00.645 --> 33:02.682
ready to topple over in an instant?

33:02.781 --> 33:07.093
Then his lips found hers
and she stopped thinking at all,

33:07.152 --> 33:09.996
only feeling,
feeling the tenderness of his kiss,

33:10.088 --> 33:12.932
the strength of his arms around her...

33:14.593 --> 33:19.008
...the steady beat of his heart under
her hand as she turned into his arms.

33:19.531 --> 33:22.011
There is a precipice,
and she was falling.

33:22.100 --> 33:24.979
Head over heels.
Falling in love with him.

33:26.104 --> 33:27.208
Chapter 11..."

33:27.806 --> 33:29.114
Hi.

33:29.541 --> 33:31.111
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:31.710 --> 33:36.352
- I want a cigarette.
- No, Gramma, it's bedtime.

33:36.448 --> 33:38.689
You're in bed.
You can't have a cigarette now, OK?

33:38.783 --> 33:40.956
Do you want me
to keep reading or are you tired?

33:41.019 --> 33:43.465
I need a cigarette!

34:17.489 --> 34:21.494
Excuse me.
Can I talk to you for a second?

34:22.193 --> 34:23.501
Why?

34:23.562 --> 34:25.838
You think I stole that money, don't you?

34:26.998 --> 34:29.239
- Yeah, you do.
- No.

34:29.333 --> 34:32.907
Look, I've stolen money before, OK?
I know what it's like to get busted.

34:33.004 --> 34:34.277
- That's what it feels like.
- OK.

34:34.371 --> 34:36.409
I didn't steal it. I got a job.

34:36.507 --> 34:39.250
- OK? This is my job.
- All right.

34:39.344 --> 34:41.290
- All right? I make money.
- OK, I got it.

34:41.379 --> 34:44.188
Money I can take girls out
on dates with.

34:46.717 --> 34:48.458
Just so you know.

34:49.020 --> 34:51.056
Good to know. OK.

34:54.793 --> 34:57.637
- What's your name?
- Go away.

34:57.729 --> 34:59.072
- "Go away"?
- Go away.

34:59.130 --> 35:00.734
That's a weird name.

35:01.399 --> 35:02.901
OK, hold on a second.

35:04.703 --> 35:10.085
I wanna give you something.
Look at that. That's my business card.

35:11.543 --> 35:14.956
I don't have a phone...
or a phone number,

35:15.046 --> 35:17.959
but if you call
this number right here...

35:19.384 --> 35:21.159
...and then you ask for me...

35:21.252 --> 35:23.425
- ..,they'll tell me you called.
- Great.

35:23.488 --> 35:25.161
Who should I say is calling?

35:42.607 --> 35:44.143
Whoa!

35:45.010 --> 35:46.580
Where are we, huh?

35:49.648 --> 35:51.958
We're inside a robot's vagina.

35:58.990 --> 36:01.197
Was this the only one
that they had?

36:01.292 --> 36:06.332
I told you, you know...
they had Cupid's Cove or this.

36:06.431 --> 36:08.206
You want me to see
if we can get Cupid's Cove?

36:08.299 --> 36:09.642
I'm gonna make a drink.

36:15.440 --> 36:16.942
There's no windows.

36:19.177 --> 36:23.557
Cool bed, huh? Check this out.

36:24.716 --> 36:26.320
- Whoa!

36:26.951 --> 36:30.558
The bed turns.
Hey, did you see this?

36:32.290 --> 36:33.564
Hey.

36:37.395 --> 36:39.170
Hey, look at me.

36:40.031 --> 36:43.672
I don't think that the-re's a fridge.

36:48.139 --> 36:50.585
Hey, that's how they laugh
in the future. Like this...

36:56.314 --> 36:57.349
Oh, God.

36:57.415 --> 37:01.090
I thought the whole point of coming here
was to have a night without kids,

37:04.189 --> 37:06.897
Hello? Yeah, hold on.

37:08.159 --> 37:11.265
Here, sweetheart, it's your mommy.
She wants to talk to you.

37:13.231 --> 37:15.768
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, sweetie!

37:18.369 --> 37:19.712
Yes.

37:19.771 --> 37:23.241
OK, honey. Don't forget
to go potty before you get into bed, OK?

37:24.509 --> 37:27.422
Bye." Bye, I love you!

37:27.512 --> 37:29.287
Frankie, this is
how they laugh in the future.

37:35.286 --> 37:36.697
Try it.

37:38.523 --> 37:39.627
Huh?

37:40.892 --> 37:44.533
Frankie, are you tooting?
Is that you tooting?

37:45.864 --> 37:48.276
Frankie... I can hear...

38:05.049 --> 38:07.825
I love you like crazy. I gotta go, OK?

38:07.919 --> 38:09.557
Kiss, kiss.

38:10.221 --> 38:11.495
Bye-bye.

38:19.264 --> 38:20.800
What are you doing?

38:23.635 --> 38:26.673
What? What's it look like I'm doing?

38:29.240 --> 38:31.015
Getting all wet and naked.

38:34.078 --> 38:36.524
I'm gonna go order some food.
Do you want some?

38:36.614 --> 38:38.150
You know what I like.

38:39.584 --> 38:41.154
Can you close the door?

38:56.768 --> 38:57.769
Oh.

39:05.109 --> 39:07.988
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like I'm doing?

40:09.073 --> 40:11.053
All right.

40:11.109 --> 40:12.452
Come up.

40:13.044 --> 40:14.352
Come up.

40:55.086 --> 40:56.724
What are you so grumpy about?

40:57.622 --> 40:59.499
Oh, I don't know, I don't know why.

41:03.227 --> 41:06.902
- Do you want a drink?
- Yes, please.

43:09.187 --> 43:10.928
- Hey, how are you?
- Fine, thank you,

43:11.022 --> 43:13.093
You're Gramma.
it's great to meet you.

43:13.191 --> 43:14.932
Cindy, come on.

43:15.026 --> 43:18.235
Could you talk to me
for Eve minutes, please?

43:18.296 --> 43:19.969
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

43:20.064 --> 43:21.941
Gramma, you know you have
an amazing granddaughter?

43:22.033 --> 43:24.479
- Oh, of course I do.
- She's unbelievable.

43:25.369 --> 43:27.713
I got these for you.
Would you please take them?

43:30.541 --> 43:32.782
Cindy, come on,
would you give me Eve minutes?

43:32.877 --> 43:35.756
This is ridiculous.
You're not even gonna talk to me?

43:35.813 --> 43:37.656
Come on, Cindy.

43:38.449 --> 43:41.430
I'm trying to say I'm sorry,
and you're acting like a total bitch!

43:46.591 --> 43:48.628
I don? know, I just
feel like I should just stop...

43:49.627 --> 43:52.233
You know, just stop thinking
about it, but I can't.

43:53.898 --> 43:58.176
Maybe I've seen too many movies,
you know, love at Hrs! sight.

43:58.803 --> 44:00.749
- Anyone call?
- No.

44:01.639 --> 44:02.982
Thanks.

44:03.074 --> 44:04.644
What do you think
about love at first sight?

44:04.742 --> 44:06.312
You think you can love somebody
just by looking at 'em?

44:06.410 --> 44:08.117
- By looking at 'em?
- But the thing is, man,

44:08.179 --> 44:11.956
I felt like I knew her. You know?
You ever get that feeling?

44:12.016 --> 44:15.930
Yeah, like, you've seen her
before and you just know her...

44:16.587 --> 44:19.124
- Yeah.
- it's a feeling.

44:20.424 --> 44:22.927
But, actually,
you really don't know her.

44:24.762 --> 44:28.539
- Yeah, I probably... I don't, right?
- That's right.

44:30.468 --> 44:35.213
- I felt like I did, though.
- If you get a little pussy...

44:36.007 --> 44:38.510
...I think all the mental-ness
will go away from you.

44:38.609 --> 44:40.282
You think
I'm too much in my head?

44:40.344 --> 44:41.687
Yeah, too much.

44:44.849 --> 44:46.692
You already know
Where she live at, right?

44:46.784 --> 44:49.390
No, she was just, like,
visiting her grandmother.

44:49.487 --> 44:52.798
So why don't you go back
to that grandmother..

44:52.857 --> 44:56.634
- ...and ask her where she lives?
- I should go back, right?

44:56.727 --> 44:58.570
Yeah, If you like her, yeah.

44:58.663 --> 45:01.200
She just seems different,
you know? I don't know.

45:01.299 --> 45:03.176
Wait. How different?

45:06.137 --> 45:09.016
I don't know,
I just got a feeling about hen

45:11.309 --> 45:14.313
You know when a song comes on
and you just gotta dance?

45:49.013 --> 45:50.754
- Hi.
- Hi.

45:50.848 --> 45:52.953
Do you know
what happened to Walter?

45:53.050 --> 45:55.963
- Who?
- Walter.

45:57.121 --> 46:01.365
He's the gentlemen that just moved in
across the hall about a month ago,

46:02.526 --> 46:05.564
I don't know anything
or anybody named Walter.

46:06.230 --> 46:07.231
Oh.

46:09.533 --> 46:10.807
OK.

46:11.769 --> 46:14.545
Hey, can I ask you something else?

46:16.374 --> 46:19.651
What's the story with that girl
that was in here like a month ago?

46:19.744 --> 46:21.121
The blonde, the young blonde?

46:21.212 --> 46:24.284
I gave her my card,
but she never called me.

46:25.149 --> 46:26.628
What's her name?

46:27.918 --> 46:29.795
- Cindy.
- Cindy.

46:29.887 --> 46:33.425
- Will you tell her I say hi?
- OK. Why not.

46:42.333 --> 46:43.437
Shit.

47:15.766 --> 47:19.441
Do you think I could sit down,
because all these other seats are taken.

47:23.174 --> 47:25.313
- OK.
- Hey, thanks.

47:27.812 --> 47:29.689
You know, I just talked
to your grandmother.

47:31.549 --> 47:33.028
That sounds weird, huh?

47:33.117 --> 47:35.028
- Yeah.
- OK, let me put it into context.

47:35.119 --> 47:39.465
I went out there to see Walter,
who's not there anymore.

47:40.358 --> 47:42.360
That's why I talked to her.

47:42.460 --> 47:44.872
Do you know what happened
to that guy, Walter?

47:44.962 --> 47:47.533
Yeah, do you know what happened
to that guy, Walter?

47:47.998 --> 47:51.309
No, I don't know what happened
to that guy, Walter.

47:51.369 --> 47:52.712
What happened?

47:52.803 --> 47:53.975
Asks]

47:57.007 --> 47:58.714
You gotta do it like that?

47:59.643 --> 48:02.214
- What do you expect?
- What do you mean?

48:02.313 --> 48:05.658
They're old.
Would you want to live like that?

48:05.716 --> 48:07.718
- Like what? In that home?
- Yeah.

48:07.818 --> 48:10.890
Well, no but I'm not getting old
and he's a dummy for dying.

48:11.889 --> 48:13.926
- Walter's a dummy for dying?
- Yeah.

48:14.024 --> 48:16.231
What are you gonna do,
wise guy?

48:16.327 --> 48:17.328
Not do it.

48:19.930 --> 48:22.843
- Are you gonna die?
- Definitely.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.001
Hmm?

48:25.369 --> 48:27.440
- What'd you say?
- I said definitely.

48:27.538 --> 48:29.540
Well, with that
kind of attitude, you will.

48:30.408 --> 48:32.445
Don't do it. it's for suckers.

48:33.444 --> 48:34.718
Don't do it.

48:35.513 --> 48:37.618
- What are you gonna do?
- Just not do it.

48:38.182 --> 48:39.889
I went out there to give him this.

48:39.950 --> 48:41.861
Isn't that nice? I found it.

48:42.853 --> 48:44.264
Look at that.

48:45.523 --> 48:47.366
- Is that him?
- Yeah, and his lady.

48:47.425 --> 48:50.201
- Isn't he handsome?
- Look at her, she's so pretty.

48:51.095 --> 48:52.904
So she's probably nuts, then.

48:55.399 --> 48:58.573
In my experience, the prettier
a girl is, the more nuts she is.

49:01.372 --> 49:03.318
Which makes you insane.

49:04.208 --> 49:06.882
You're probably nutty-coo-coo crazy.

49:11.048 --> 49:13.654
It's not your fault.
You know, it's just like...

49:14.285 --> 49:16.492
Everybody treats you different.

49:16.587 --> 49:19.466
Like, you make jokes and they're
not funny, but people laugh anyway.

49:19.557 --> 49:21.059
That's gotta make you nuts.

49:22.626 --> 49:26.335
I like how you can compliment
and insult somebody at the same time.

49:26.430 --> 49:27.932
In equal measure.

49:27.998 --> 49:29.739
What's an insult about that?

49:30.601 --> 49:32.581
That I'm crazy and I'm not funny.

49:32.636 --> 49:36.448
Well... I don't know if you're
not funny, tell me a joke.

49:38.242 --> 49:42.019
So there's a child molester
and a little boy walking into the woods.

49:43.981 --> 49:48.020
The child molester and the little boy
keep walking further and further,

49:48.118 --> 49:50.758
and it's getting darker and darker
and they're going deeper and deeper

49:50.821 --> 49:53.028
into the woods and the child molester...

49:53.123 --> 49:56.263
...and the little boy looks up
at the child molester and he says,

49:56.327 --> 49:58.307
"Gee, mister, I'm getting scared!"

49:58.362 --> 50:00.205
And the child molester
looks down at him and says,

50:00.297 --> 50:03.437
"You think you're soared, kid?
I gotta walk outta here alone."

50:10.875 --> 50:12.650
You don't think that's funny?

50:15.312 --> 50:18.293
- No, I'm sorry.
- I do.

50:19.183 --> 50:21.686
You get along
with your grandma, huh?

50:21.785 --> 50:23.492
Yeah, she makes me laugh.

50:25.122 --> 50:29.628
Nobody else talks in my family.
And when they talk, they just yell.

50:33.330 --> 50:35.970
I'm never getting married.

50:36.901 --> 50:39.814
This is a nice place, you live.
You like it?

50:40.504 --> 50:43.007
- it's all right.
- Where you wanna go?

50:44.341 --> 50:45.911
I wanna go away to school.

50:46.911 --> 50:49.983
- What are you gonna study?
- Medicine.

50:50.481 --> 50:52.927
Really?

50:53.017 --> 50:54.928
- Yeah, really.
- Yeah, right.

50:55.019 --> 50:56.521
Yeah, right.

50:56.587 --> 51:00.558
Girls like you.., Girls that look like
you don't go and study medicine.

51:00.658 --> 51:02.160
What do I look like?

51:03.661 --> 51:06.164
Girls like you are supermodels.

51:06.830 --> 51:10.334
- You got any, like, talents?
- Like hidden talents?

51:10.501 --> 51:12.503
Uh...

51:21.745 --> 51:23.520
That's all the presidents.

51:47.371 --> 51:48.907
That was rad.

51:52.042 --> 51:53.385
Can you dance?

51:57.047 --> 51:58.788
- You can tap dance?
- Can you?

51:58.882 --> 52:02.887
No. Here, I'll play a song
and you dance.

52:06.390 --> 52:07.664
OK?

52:13.063 --> 52:14.337
Come here.

52:15.566 --> 52:16.943
Come here, like this.

52:17.001 --> 52:19.481
Right here, behind the heart.
In front of the heart.

52:20.137 --> 52:21.275
OK.

52:22.239 --> 52:23.809
I can't really sing.

52:23.907 --> 52:27.081
I have to sing goofy in order to sing.
Like, I have to sing stupid,

52:27.745 --> 52:29.247
- OK?
- OK.

53:12.122 --> 53:13.624
You're actually good.

53:16.126 --> 53:17.628
OK, slow dance.

53:17.695 --> 53:19.197
Slow dance to this part.

53:48.692 --> 53:50.194
Whooo!

54:01.839 --> 54:03.341
You're not gonna eat that?

54:04.775 --> 54:06.448
Why don't you do something?

54:08.512 --> 54:09.855
What do you mean?

54:10.781 --> 54:12.556
I don't know.

54:14.752 --> 54:16.595
What does that mean?

54:16.687 --> 54:20.294
- Why don't I do something?
- isn't there something you want to do?

54:20.390 --> 54:22.199
There something you want to do?

54:23.460 --> 54:25.770
- Like what?
- I don't know.

54:25.863 --> 54:28.935
You're so good at so many things,
you could do anything you wanted to do,

54:29.032 --> 54:32.104
you're good at everything that you do,
isn't there something else you wanna do?

54:32.202 --> 54:35.547
Than what? Than be your
husband? To be Frankie's dad?

54:35.606 --> 54:37.415
What do you want me to do?

54:37.474 --> 54:39.454
What... In your, like, dream scenario,

54:39.543 --> 54:42.717
of me, like, doing what I'm good at,
what would that be?

54:42.780 --> 54:44.589
I don't know,
you're so good at so many things,

54:44.648 --> 54:47.788
you can do so many things,
you have such capacity.

54:47.885 --> 54:49.262
For what?

54:49.319 --> 54:52.425
You can sing, you can draw, you can...

54:55.492 --> 54:57.438
...dance.

54:57.494 --> 55:01.135
Listen, I didn't
wanna be somebody's husband.

55:01.799 --> 55:02.971
OK?

55:03.066 --> 55:07.640
And I didn't wanna be somebody's dad.
That wasn't my goal in life,

55:08.338 --> 55:10.818
Some guys it is.., Wasn't mine.

55:12.910 --> 55:17.859
But somehow, I've...
It was what I wanted.

55:18.582 --> 55:20.323
I didn't know that.

55:21.785 --> 55:24.595
And it's all I wanna do..,
I don't want to do anything else.

55:24.655 --> 55:28.364
That's what I want to do.
I work so I can do that.

55:31.128 --> 55:33.267
I'd like to see you have a job
where you didn't have to start drinking

55:33.330 --> 55:34.968
at eight o'clock
in the morning to go to it.

55:35.032 --> 55:38.206
No, I have a job that I can drink
at eight o'clock in the morning.

55:38.435 --> 55:40.711
What a luxury, you know?

55:41.471 --> 55:44.509
I get up for work, I have a beer,
I go to work, I paint somebody's house,

55:44.608 --> 55:47.145
they're excited about it,
I come home, I get to be with you.

55:47.211 --> 55:49.452
What's... like... This is the dream.

55:50.113 --> 55:52.024
It doesn't ever disappoint you?

55:52.115 --> 55:54.288
Why? Why would it disappoint me?

55:55.118 --> 55:57.359
- Because you have all this potential.
- I could still do whatever I could do.

55:57.454 --> 56:00.867
So what? Why do you have to
fucking make money off your potential?

56:00.958 --> 56:02.665
Look, I'm not even saying
you have to make money off it.

56:02.726 --> 56:05.673
- Don't you miss it?
- What does even potential mean?

56:05.729 --> 56:08.801
What does that mean, potential?
Potential for what?

56:10.567 --> 56:12.171
To turn it into what?

56:14.905 --> 56:20.048
We rarely sit down and have an adult
conversation, because every time we do

56:20.143 --> 56:24.216
you take what I say and you turn it
around into something I didn't mean.

56:25.816 --> 56:29.593
You just... twist it.

56:30.988 --> 56:33.832
Start blabbing,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

56:35.659 --> 56:37.900
If you're not interested
in what I have to say,

56:37.995 --> 56:40.373
then maybe I just
shouldn't say anything.

56:44.334 --> 56:45.836
That's funny, huh?

56:50.440 --> 56:52.249
What's funny about that?

56:52.876 --> 56:55.857
Good luck. I...

56:56.713 --> 56:59.421
I'd like to see you think
about what you say,

56:59.516 --> 57:03.293
instead of saying what you think
all the time. Good luck, give it a try!

57:09.559 --> 57:11.368
What do you mean?

57:12.262 --> 57:15.471
- You wanna fight me?
- Yeah, I wanna fight you.

57:23.874 --> 57:26.218
- OK, there you go.
- On your back,

57:27.044 --> 57:28.614
On your back, motherfucker!

57:32.416 --> 57:34.327
Ow.

57:34.418 --> 57:36.625
Cheers, you're the best.

57:43.894 --> 57:46.465
You drunk? You drunk, drunk?

57:46.563 --> 57:48.304
Don't go to sleep, hey.

57:49.399 --> 57:53.677
Don't go to sleep, OK? Stay awake.

57:53.770 --> 57:56.910
Hey, look at me, look at me,
look at me. You awake?

57:57.908 --> 58:01.014
You awake? Yeah? OK.

58:02.279 --> 58:04.122
I gotta pee my diddy, I'll be back.

58:18.695 --> 58:20.038
- Ah!

58:20.764 --> 58:23.176
- Are you OK?
- Come here!

58:25.469 --> 58:27.380
I may or may not have fallen.

58:29.706 --> 58:31.708
Come here!

58:31.808 --> 58:35.153
Come here! Come here!

58:36.113 --> 58:38.992
- Fuck.
- Hey, beautiful, come here.

58:39.049 --> 58:42.656
Give me a hand.
Help me back into the future.

58:42.719 --> 58:44.699
- Come here.
- Give me your hand.

58:46.790 --> 58:47.996
- Get up.
- This is funny.

58:49.626 --> 58:51.628
Come here. Come on down here.

58:52.195 --> 58:53.799
- Ow!
- Probably a big mistake.

58:55.132 --> 58:57.169
- OW.
- That is a... That is a huge mistake.

58:57.300 --> 58:59.473
- Ow!

59:00.670 --> 59:02.843
Come here, you saucy little minx.

59:05.475 --> 59:07.421
You are so beautiful.

59:09.813 --> 59:11.520
You are so beautiful.

59:17.888 --> 59:20.095
Do you wanna have another baby with me?

59:22.025 --> 59:23.561
Hmm?

59:25.996 --> 59:28.272
Will you have another baby with me?

59:29.833 --> 59:31.835
Do you want to make a baby with me?

59:32.836 --> 59:35.112
I want to have a baby with you.

59:36.406 --> 59:38.579
- Stop.
- Stop what?

59:38.675 --> 59:40.916
- Stop. Stop.
- What? Shh.

59:41.945 --> 59:43.754
Shut your beautiful mouth.

59:43.847 --> 59:45.292
Shut it. Come here.

59:58.595 --> 01:00:01.041
Fuck. Ouch!

01:00:01.865 --> 01:00:04.937
What are you doing, huh?

01:00:05.869 --> 01:00:07.644
What's the matter with you? Come here.

01:00:08.472 --> 01:00:11.078
Baby. Baby, baby, baby, baby...

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:38.602
Would you cut it out?
Would you fucking stop it?

01:00:38.668 --> 01:00:41.842
Come on, stop, stop, stop!
What's going...? What are you doing?

01:00:44.574 --> 01:00:47.077
What are you doing?
Why are you doing that?

01:00:48.612 --> 01:00:50.023
It hurts!

01:00:51.281 --> 01:00:52.954
- What do you want?

01:00:53.016 --> 01:00:55.792
How much rejection
am I supposed to take?

01:00:55.852 --> 01:00:58.628
You know, I deserve
a little bit of affection.

01:00:58.688 --> 01:01:01.635
I'm good to you. I'm good to you
and I'm good to Frankie,

01:01:01.691 --> 01:01:03.671
and I love you. I don't deserve this.

01:01:04.661 --> 01:01:07.767
What are you doing? What do you want?

01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:13.379
That's how you want it?

01:01:19.042 --> 01:01:20.612
This is how you want it?

01:01:21.444 --> 01:01:23.151
This is how you want it? Come on.

01:01:24.381 --> 01:01:25.689
OK.

01:01:25.782 --> 01:01:28.854
- OK. OK. Come here.

01:01:48.405 --> 01:01:49.975
Baby, I can't do it.

01:01:50.473 --> 01:01:54.148
- I can't do it like this, baby.

01:01:55.312 --> 01:01:57.155
Baby, baby, baby...

01:01:59.749 --> 01:02:02.161
I can't fucking do it like this.

01:02:02.219 --> 01:02:03.926
Stop it. Stop.

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:07.058
Stop, Don't give me this shit,

01:02:07.157 --> 01:02:09.660
this fuckin', like,
"you can have my body," bullshit.

01:02:09.726 --> 01:02:11.569
I don't want that. I want you.

01:02:11.661 --> 01:02:14.198
I'm not gonna do it like this.
What, do you want me to rape you?

01:02:14.264 --> 01:02:16.210
- I want you to stop.
- Is that what you want?

01:02:16.266 --> 01:02:18.041
- Stop it.
- You want me to hit you?

01:02:18.101 --> 01:02:20.206
- Stop it.
- What's the matter with you?

01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:22.181
Fucking stop it!

01:02:22.239 --> 01:02:24.412
- You want me to hit you?
- Yeah, hit me.

01:02:24.507 --> 01:02:25.747
- Is that what you want?
- Yeah, that's what I want.

01:02:25.842 --> 01:02:27.913
Would that make it OK
for you to treat me like this?

01:02:28.011 --> 01:02:29.922
Yeah, that's what I want, baby. Hit me.

01:02:30.013 --> 01:02:31.583
- Come on, hit me.
- Is that what you want?

01:02:31.681 --> 01:02:34.719
I'm not gonna do it.
I'm not gonna fuckin' do it!

01:02:35.752 --> 01:02:37.288
OK?

01:02:37.721 --> 01:02:41.100
I don't give a shit how much
you want it, I'm not gonna do it.

01:02:42.525 --> 01:02:45.563
OK, I'm not gonna do it!

01:02:48.031 --> 01:02:49.567
I'm not gonna do it.

01:02:49.633 --> 01:02:53.137
You want me to hit you?
I'm not gonna do it! I love you.

01:02:54.037 --> 01:02:55.243
OK?

01:02:55.305 --> 01:02:56.943
Let me out.

01:02:58.208 --> 01:03:00.449
Open the door. Open the door.

01:03:01.578 --> 01:03:02.921
Open the door.

01:03:03.713 --> 01:03:05.454
Open the door.

01:03:05.548 --> 01:03:07.994
Hey! Open this door!

01:03:08.084 --> 01:03:11.930
- Hey! Open the door!

01:03:13.223 --> 01:03:16.397
Open the door!

01:03:17.127 --> 01:03:18.470
Hey!

01:03:19.396 --> 01:03:21.137
Open the door!

01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:24.509
Can you open the door?

01:03:25.802 --> 01:03:27.440
Can you open the door?

01:03:28.638 --> 01:03:30.311
Go.

01:03:41.518 --> 01:03:42.997
No. No!

01:03:51.928 --> 01:03:54.602
Ow... ow. Ow.

01:03:57.100 --> 01:03:59.706
What is going on? What kind
of operation are you running."

01:03:59.803 --> 01:04:01.441
- Stop.
- ...around here?

01:04:02.639 --> 01:04:04.016
OK.

01:04:21.791 --> 01:04:24.328
Do not touch
the young lady in my taxi!

01:04:24.861 --> 01:04:28.502
Please, sir!
Don't touch her back there, please?

01:04:28.565 --> 01:04:33.412
- Thank you! Thank you very much.
- Come on! Why not?

01:04:33.503 --> 01:04:36.541
Sir! Please there's no sex in my taxi!

01:04:36.639 --> 01:04:39.313
Do not touch the young lady in my taxi!

01:04:39.376 --> 01:04:41.754
I'll have you know that she was
putting the moves on me.

01:04:41.845 --> 01:04:44.985
That's not true,
Would you believe a face like this?

01:04:45.048 --> 01:04:47.551
- That doesn't...
- Look at that face. Look at that face.

01:04:47.650 --> 01:04:50.722
I will not have you trying
something that's wrong in my car!

01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:51.924
What's wrong?

01:04:52.021 --> 01:04:54.092
This is my car,
this is like my home.

01:04:54.190 --> 01:04:56.067
You're in my home now, OK?

01:04:56.159 --> 01:04:58.901
It's not my business
what you do with this girl,

01:04:58.995 --> 01:05:01.066
but you're not gonna do it in my cab.

01:05:58.388 --> 01:05:59.833
Oh, God.

01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:05.801
God. Oh, no, no, no.

01:06:05.895 --> 01:06:08.136
No, no, no, no, no...

01:06:08.231 --> 01:06:09.642
No.

01:06:16.573 --> 01:06:18.018
Oh, my God.

01:06:18.107 --> 01:06:20.815
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:28.921
Good job.

01:07:59.542 --> 01:08:00.919
Hi.

01:08:08.551 --> 01:08:10.394
Hi.

01:08:13.289 --> 01:08:14.791
You OK?

01:08:15.692 --> 01:08:17.365
Yeah, you OK?

01:08:19.595 --> 01:08:21.439
Yeah, you OK?

01:08:27.036 --> 01:08:28.709
You gonna talk to me or what?

01:08:30.038 --> 01:08:31.712
You gonna tell me what's goin' on?

01:08:35.478 --> 01:08:38.755
- You're not gonna tell me?
- I don't know what you want me to say.

01:08:38.814 --> 01:08:40.886
I want you to tell me what's going on.
I wanna know.

01:08:41.783 --> 01:08:43.821
You got me feeling sick, you know?

01:08:45.321 --> 01:08:46.993
I'm very intuitive.

01:08:48.424 --> 01:08:49.960
I know there's something up.

01:08:58.134 --> 01:09:00.636
- I don't know what to do.
- OK, you're not gonna tell me?

01:09:01.904 --> 01:09:04.316
Stop! Stop, stop! No, no, no, stop!

01:09:04.407 --> 01:09:07.115
- You gonna tell me?
- Stop! Come down!

01:09:07.176 --> 01:09:09.417
- You gonna tell me?
- Just come down! I'm not kidding you!

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:12.255
- You're gonna tell me what it is?
- Come... Please come down!

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:14.192
Come down. Please... Please stop.

01:09:14.283 --> 01:09:16.763
- You want me to go over the edge?
- No, I want you to come down!

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:18.627
- Tell me what it is.
- Come on, it's dangerous!

01:09:18.688 --> 01:09:20.689
- You gonna tell me?
- No!

01:09:20.790 --> 01:09:23.167
No, stop! Please come on!

01:09:23.259 --> 01:09:26.365
Please! I'm pregnant!
Stop, come back, please!

01:09:26.929 --> 01:09:29.773
Please come down. Please come down.

01:09:44.279 --> 01:09:45.622
Is it mine?

01:09:49.551 --> 01:09:51.964
- I don't know. I don't know.
- You don't know?

01:09:52.654 --> 01:09:53.962
Maybe.

01:09:54.524 --> 01:09:57.562
- Maybe?
- Probably not.

01:10:07.303 --> 01:10:08.839
What are you gonna do?

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:12.813
- What am I gonna do?
- What are you gonna do?

01:10:14.343 --> 01:10:16.380
I don't know...

01:10:16.479 --> 01:10:19.016
You're gonna have it? You're not
gonna have it? What are you gonna do?

01:10:21.818 --> 01:10:23.820
- You thought about this?
- I don't know.

01:10:24.987 --> 01:10:26.432
You don't know?

01:10:40.369 --> 01:10:44.613
You've opted for our
vacuum-aspiration abortion today.

01:10:44.707 --> 01:10:47.017
I'm just gonna ask you a few questions.

01:10:47.844 --> 01:10:52.259
They're sensitive in nature,
so if at any time, you're uncomfortable,

01:10:52.348 --> 01:10:54.191
you just let me know, OK?

01:10:57.220 --> 01:11:02.067
At what age were you
when you first had intercourse?

01:11:04.393 --> 01:11:07.033
- Thirteen.
- OK.

01:11:12.235 --> 01:11:14.112
That's not unusual.

01:11:15.037 --> 01:11:17.449
OK, and how many sexual partners

01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:21.044
would you say you've had
from when you first began?

01:11:26.582 --> 01:11:28.323
Maybe...

01:11:29.385 --> 01:11:31.888
...twenty... twenty...

01:11:32.588 --> 01:11:35.068
- ...twenty-five?
- OK.

01:11:35.491 --> 01:11:37.971
Do you know
which partner you were with

01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:40.233
at the time that you became pregnant?

01:11:40.897 --> 01:11:45.573
OK. And is that partner
supportive to you?

01:11:46.736 --> 01:11:47.737
Um...

01:11:50.406 --> 01:11:52.818
No. OK.

01:12:02.251 --> 01:12:05.755
Good, all right, now I'm gonna
put my hand on your belly...

01:12:07.256 --> 01:12:09.361
...and then I'm gonna
introduce a finger.

01:12:09.458 --> 01:12:11.665
You're gonna feel it.
OK, there you are.

01:12:11.761 --> 01:12:13.638
- All right...

01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:16.276
That's it, OK, good.

01:12:16.332 --> 01:12:20.337
Deep breathing. That's it.
All right, I feel the uterus.

01:12:20.436 --> 01:12:24.384
Indeed, it's probably
11 and a half, 12 weeks.

01:12:24.473 --> 01:12:26.680
It's in a safe position
for the procedure.

01:12:26.776 --> 01:12:32.124
OK, I'm gonna insert a speculum.
it's gonna cause some pressure.

01:12:32.849 --> 01:12:34.988
Here it goes, this is it.

01:12:35.818 --> 01:12:39.061
That's it. I know it's uncomfortable.
I know it's uncomfortable.

01:12:39.155 --> 01:12:43.695
But as much as you can relax,
the easier it goes, OK,

01:12:43.793 --> 01:12:46.069
it's set right where I need to have it.

01:12:46.162 --> 01:12:49.166
Good work. Keep that breathing.

01:12:49.232 --> 01:12:51.508
- You're making me breathe hard.
- You're doing great.

01:12:51.567 --> 01:12:56.073
The next thing I'm gonna do is I
want to give you some local anesthesia.

01:12:56.172 --> 01:12:58.709
It's a little uncomfortable,
so what I want you to do...

01:12:59.642 --> 01:13:01.679
Right now, I'm gonna
give you the first injection.

01:13:01.744 --> 01:13:03.746
Take a giant breath and cough.

01:13:03.846 --> 01:13:07.020
Go ahead, Breath," Cough.

01:13:08.484 --> 01:13:11.158
OK, fine, fine, fine.

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:16.226
OK. I'm just gonna
put that down and let it take effect.

01:13:16.926 --> 01:13:21.773
Breathe deeply, slowly, deeply...

01:13:23.032 --> 01:13:25.239
What I'm gonna do
is apply an instrument,

01:13:25.334 --> 01:13:28.042
so I can hold the cervix still.

01:13:28.104 --> 01:13:30.675
Shouldn't feel this.
Maybe a little pressure.

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:33.914
- I can't.
- Oh, sweetheart, are you OK?

01:13:34.010 --> 01:13:35.353
Cindy?

01:13:35.945 --> 01:13:38.084
- Stop.
- OK. OK.

01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:41.127
- Stop.
- OK, I'm sorry and I will stop.

01:13:42.051 --> 01:13:46.932
All right, you wanna sit up?
OK, all right.

01:13:47.023 --> 01:13:51.699
You want me to just stop
the whole procedure, is that correct?

01:13:51.761 --> 01:13:54.605
All right, I'm gonna step out.

01:13:54.697 --> 01:13:56.540
- Felicia...
- Yeah.

01:13:57.199 --> 01:14:00.373
- Do you wanna put your things back on?
- Can I see my...?

01:14:01.537 --> 01:14:04.313
- Can I see my friend?
- Sure, honey.

01:14:55.992 --> 01:14:57.437
Let's do it.

01:15:02.765 --> 01:15:04.506
Let's be a family.

01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:19.357
Let's be a family.

01:15:32.061 --> 01:15:34.302
You don't have to do this,
you know.

01:15:35.564 --> 01:15:37.373
It's not your fault.

01:15:39.635 --> 01:15:40.978
I love you.

01:15:42.471 --> 01:15:44.473
I love you, too.

01:16:09.999 --> 01:16:13.503
Hey, it's me Cindy. Hi.

01:16:14.103 --> 01:16:15.912
We need you to come in...

01:16:16.005 --> 01:16:18.952
Who else did you call?

01:16:19.041 --> 01:16:22.682
- I called Janet, and I called...
- I'm out of town, too.

01:16:24.246 --> 01:16:26.749
What time is it? What time is it?

01:16:27.349 --> 01:16:30.125
Six, seven, eight, nine...

01:16:30.219 --> 01:16:31.562
Nine o'clock.

01:16:32.354 --> 01:16:35.961
If I'm there at nine?
I'm coming if I'm there at nine.

01:17:35.117 --> 01:17:39.259
Cindy!

01:17:42.591 --> 01:17:44.195
Cin!

01:17:45.294 --> 01:17:47.171
I'm gonna fuckin' kill her.

01:17:48.164 --> 01:17:49.268
Yo.

01:17:49.331 --> 01:17:51.470
This is your 11:00am wake up call.

01:17:51.534 --> 01:17:53.946
OK. Thank you.

01:18:22.631 --> 01:18:23.837
Cin?

01:18:55.531 --> 01:19:00.776
- Yeah, Um. ..

01:19:01.537 --> 01:19:03.676
Where's the nearest bus station?

01:19:34.803 --> 01:19:38.216
Sunday, 11:16 pm...

01:19:39.308 --> 01:19:43.586
I just want to say to you,
thanks for making all bets off

01:19:43.646 --> 01:19:47.059
and for freeing me of my human decency.

01:19:47.116 --> 01:19:49.323
All your shit is going in the trash.

01:19:49.418 --> 01:19:51.762
All your books
are gonna get fucking ripped up.

01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:54.460
You want to go to war? I mean,
we'll go to war, we'll see who wins.

01:19:54.556 --> 01:19:58.732
I know who the fucker is, OK?
And Pm gonna destroy him.

01:19:58.794 --> 01:20:02.332
Sunday, 11:58pm.

01:20:02.431 --> 01:20:05.071
You probably don't even know
what you did.

01:20:05.134 --> 01:20:07.637
I want you to hear something, OK?

01:20:07.736 --> 01:20:11.411
I have never., I have never
cursed at a girl in my life.

01:20:11.473 --> 01:20:12.645
Fuck you!

01:20:13.442 --> 01:20:15.820
Fuck you, bitch!

01:20:16.745 --> 01:20:18.520
Do you understand that?

01:20:18.614 --> 01:20:22.619
Fm gonna find him
and I'm gonna fuck his ass up!

01:20:22.685 --> 01:20:25.325
I hope he looks so beautiful to you...

01:20:25.421 --> 01:20:29.494
I hope he looks so beautiful
to you when Iâ€™m done.

01:20:29.591 --> 01:20:31.093
Do you hear me?

01:20:33.329 --> 01:20:35.331
End of messages.

01:21:14.670 --> 01:21:16.149
Hey.

01:21:20.376 --> 01:21:23.482
Hey, I'm looking for Dean.

01:21:24.146 --> 01:21:26.092
For Dean. I'm looking for Dean.
You know where he's at?

01:21:26.181 --> 01:21:28.058
- Yeah, I'm Dean.
- Oh, OK,

01:21:35.057 --> 01:21:37.594
Your little boy's
gonna call me Daddy from now on.

01:21:56.578 --> 01:21:59.081
Fuck you! Bitch!

01:21:59.181 --> 01:22:01.252
- Such a little bitch. Pussy.
- Piece of shit!

01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:04.388
- Fuck him up.
- Bitch!

01:22:04.853 --> 01:22:07.026
You fuckin' piece of shit!

01:22:07.089 --> 01:22:08.534
Fucking pussy!

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:43.126
Dr. Feinberg's Office. Mm-hmm.
OK, when were you looking to come in?

01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:47.131
Oh! Busy! Haven't sat down yet.

01:22:47.229 --> 01:22:48.970
What do you have?
Can you walk with me?

01:22:49.064 --> 01:22:52.443
I've got a woman in five, Hispanic...
Excuse me,

01:22:52.501 --> 01:22:55.311
Doesn't speak much English, and she's
complaining of pain in her left breast,

01:22:55.404 --> 01:22:58.942
All right, I'll be in in a minute.
Oh, hey, you know what I was thinking?

01:22:59.007 --> 01:23:02.978
I realize it might be hard for you to
move the whole family up to Riverdale,

01:23:03.078 --> 01:23:04.648
'cause your daughter's
still in school and everything,

01:23:04.746 --> 01:23:07.158
and I thought maybe
you get an apartment.

01:23:07.249 --> 01:23:09.991
You know, work during the week,
drive home on the weekends.

01:23:11.487 --> 01:23:13.694
Wouldn't have to worry about being
lonely. We could hang out together.

01:23:13.789 --> 01:23:15.598
You know, get dinner sometimes.

01:23:17.759 --> 01:23:19.830
Anyway, that was not a proposition.

01:23:19.928 --> 01:23:21.430
- It was just...
- I'm married.

01:23:21.497 --> 01:23:24.774
Just trying to... Just trying to help.

01:23:25.601 --> 01:23:28.480
I thought you wanted me there
because I'm good at my job.

01:23:28.537 --> 01:23:29.948
Yeah, I thought...

01:23:32.107 --> 01:23:34.849
Anyway... I'll see you in a minute.

01:23:55.731 --> 01:23:58.041
I can't do that over the phone.
I can't do it over the phone.

01:23:58.133 --> 01:23:59.203
Hold on, please.

01:23:59.301 --> 01:24:03.545
Sir, could you just fill that out and
when you're done bring it back up to me?

01:24:03.639 --> 01:24:05.710
I don't need this.

01:24:05.807 --> 01:24:07.582
Could you hold on just
one second, please?

01:24:07.676 --> 01:24:09.678
- OK, thank you.
- I was looking for my wife.

01:24:10.579 --> 01:24:13.822
- I don't need that.
- OK, and who is your wife?

01:24:13.882 --> 01:24:17.489
- Cynthia.
- Oh, you must be Dean.

01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:22.566
OK, yeah, let me get her,
she'll be right with you.

01:24:24.927 --> 01:24:27.874
Cindy, sweetie,
you have a visitor,

01:24:28.764 --> 01:24:31.005
- Who?
- it's your husband.

01:24:31.066 --> 01:24:34.536
- I think he's been drinking.

01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:42.950
- Hi.
- Oh, there you are.

01:24:43.045 --> 01:24:44.888
What are you doing here?

01:24:45.881 --> 01:24:48.725
Oh, well, you're awful friendly
right now, aren't ya?

01:24:49.451 --> 01:24:53.092
- No, I'm just surprised to see you.
- Oh, this is where the smiles happen.

01:24:53.188 --> 01:24:55.691
This the smile room? Huh?

01:24:56.892 --> 01:24:59.099
You take off, you leave me,
you don't tell me what's going on?

01:24:59.194 --> 01:25:02.801
I was so goddamn worried, I thought
something might of happened to Frankie!

01:25:02.898 --> 01:25:05.378
- I don't know what the hell happened.
- Meems, can you give me a few?

01:25:05.434 --> 01:25:06.913
- You just take off like that?
- I'll be right here if you need me.

01:25:06.969 --> 01:25:08.778
Yeah, Meems, can you give her a few?

01:25:08.870 --> 01:25:10.747
I don't know if there's an emergency...
You're just gone!

01:25:10.806 --> 01:25:13.650
- Frankie's fine. Come on, lets go.
- Well, good to know.

01:25:13.742 --> 01:25:15.380
Cindy, I'm here if you need me.

01:25:15.444 --> 01:25:17.890
- OK, come on, let's go.
- Don't let him brainwash you.

01:25:17.946 --> 01:25:20.483
- Can you give me a hand with this?
- "Don't let him brainwash you"?

01:25:20.582 --> 01:25:22.391
Can you give me a hand?

01:25:22.918 --> 01:25:24.488
Oh, God...

01:25:32.828 --> 01:25:35.832
Look, OK, I know everything
got fucked up last night.

01:25:37.065 --> 01:25:38.100
OK?

01:25:38.166 --> 01:25:39.304
Can't believe you'd show up here drunk.

01:25:39.401 --> 01:25:41.472
Hey, I'm talking to you!

01:25:42.237 --> 01:25:45.309
- Hey. I know that...
- Can you drive?

01:25:45.407 --> 01:25:47.409
- What?
- I said can you drive?

01:25:47.476 --> 01:25:49.513
What do you mean?
What kinda question is that?

01:25:49.611 --> 01:25:51.318
Of course I can drive.
I know how to drive...

01:25:51.413 --> 01:25:53.450
Take the keys, go home.

01:25:53.515 --> 01:25:55.825
You don't even care
if I fuckin' can drive.

01:25:55.917 --> 01:25:57.863
You'd love it if I got in
a goddamned accident.

01:25:57.953 --> 01:26:00.593
Yeah, I'd love it.
I'd just love it, you're so right.

01:26:00.656 --> 01:26:03.193
That's the point. You don't
have any goddamned time anymore.

01:26:03.291 --> 01:26:04.929
It all goes to this fucking place.

01:26:04.993 --> 01:26:07.496
And these fucking people
don't give a shit about you.

01:26:07.596 --> 01:26:10.509
- Do they? Hey!
- Just go home!

01:26:10.599 --> 01:26:12.306
Hey, come here for a second,
I'm gonna come in there!

01:26:12.367 --> 01:26:16.372
I'm gonna come in!
All right, I'm coming.

01:26:20.208 --> 01:26:23.018
Just have a seat and we'll be
with you as soon as we can, OK?

01:26:23.111 --> 01:26:24.613
Thank you.

01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:29.151
- Are you OK? Is he gone?
- I fucking hate him.

01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:33.724
Why don't you just give her
a couple of minutes?

01:26:33.822 --> 01:26:35.529
No. Dean, you can't come back here.

01:26:35.624 --> 01:26:37.194
- Oh, God.
- Dean...

01:26:38.827 --> 01:26:41.569
- You can't be back here.
- it's OK, you're OK.

01:26:42.698 --> 01:26:44.871
I can't do this,
I can't take this shit.

01:26:44.966 --> 01:26:47.207
- Come outside with me.
- Dean, I cannot take this shit anymore.

01:26:47.302 --> 01:26:49.077
- Just come outside.
- I cannot take this shit.

01:26:49.171 --> 01:26:52.152
I am not going outside with you.
I've had it!

01:26:52.207 --> 01:26:54.209
- I've had it. I've had it.
- Come and talk to me...

01:26:54.309 --> 01:26:57.153
I am up to here!
I'm done, OK? I'm done!

01:26:57.212 --> 01:26:58.919
- Let's go outside...
- I'm done. I'm done.

01:26:59.014 --> 01:27:01.494
Look, no... I am done. I am done.

01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:04.531
I'm done with this.
I'm done being angry like this.

01:27:04.586 --> 01:27:06.725
I'm done having you drunk like this.
I am done!

01:27:06.822 --> 01:27:09.234
- Don't close that door!
- I'm closing the door.

01:27:09.324 --> 01:27:11.235
- Don't...
- Don't talk like that.

01:27:11.326 --> 01:27:13.363
- Mimi...
- Hey, don't talk to Mimi.

01:27:13.428 --> 01:27:16.204
Hey, Mimi, you know what?
We're gonna take a little minute.

01:27:16.264 --> 01:27:18.039
We're just gonna take a second.

01:27:18.100 --> 01:27:20.410
You know what,
this is why I don't talk to you.

01:27:20.502 --> 01:27:22.573
'Cause you go from here to here
in no time at all,

01:27:22.671 --> 01:27:24.912
This is why you talk to me.
Because I'm here.

01:27:25.006 --> 01:27:26.747
This is the only reason
you're talking to me.

01:27:26.842 --> 01:27:29.914
- You fuckin' asshole.
- I'm a fuckin' asshole?

01:27:30.011 --> 01:27:31.684
I'm so out of love with you.

01:27:31.747 --> 01:27:34.557
I've got nothing left for you,
nothing, nothing!

01:27:35.350 --> 01:27:38.695
Nothing! There is nothing here for you!
There is nothing here for you!

01:27:38.754 --> 01:27:42.429
- I don't love you. I don't...
- Don't say stuff you can't take back.

01:27:42.524 --> 01:27:45.403
You fucking asked for it, you
asked me, You asked me. I talk to you.

01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:46.939
I couldn't drive you crazy
unless I love you.

01:27:47.028 --> 01:27:49.304
I gave you the goddamn answer
and you don't like it.

01:27:49.397 --> 01:27:50.808
- Are you gonna hit me?
- That's why I don't talk to you.

01:27:50.899 --> 01:27:51.934
No, I'm not gonna hit you.

01:27:52.033 --> 01:27:53.910
- You're the bad guy, not me, asshole.
- I'm the bad guy?

01:27:53.969 --> 01:27:56.609
- Yeah, asshole!
- OK.

01:27:56.705 --> 01:27:58.378
Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:00.442
Yeah, I'm more man than you are,
you fucking cunt.

01:28:00.542 --> 01:28:02.783
- Don't say that shit about being a man.
- I am, I am. I can handle it.

01:28:02.878 --> 01:28:04.880
What is it with this shit
and being a man? What is that?

01:28:04.946 --> 01:28:06.050
What does it even mean?

01:28:06.114 --> 01:28:07.991
- What is that?
- What does it mean?

01:28:08.083 --> 01:28:11.121
- What does it mean to be a man?
- You're scaring us, you're scaring us!

01:28:11.219 --> 01:28:14.132
- It doesn't mean you can come here...
- Don't say that stuff.

01:28:14.222 --> 01:28:16.930
- "Be a man!" What is that shit?
- I mean, don't bully..,

01:28:16.992 --> 01:28:19.131
I'll be a man.
You want me to be a man? Here you go.

01:28:19.227 --> 01:28:21.138
- Is this what men do?
- Oh, just stop it.

01:28:21.229 --> 01:28:23.300
- I'm a big man!
- Get out!

01:28:23.398 --> 01:28:25.810
- Get out. Stop it!
- Look at me, I'm a big fucking man!

01:28:25.901 --> 01:28:27.471
- I'm being a man!
- No, I'm the man!

01:28:27.569 --> 01:28:29.139
- I'm being a man now.
- Stop it! Stop it, now.

01:28:29.237 --> 01:28:31.615
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Hold on. This is what men do.

01:28:31.673 --> 01:28:34.313
I'm tired of talking.
I'm fucking tired of talking.

01:28:34.409 --> 01:28:36.286
- Hey, hey...
- Stop it!

01:28:36.344 --> 01:28:38.187
Excuse me! Excuse me!

01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:40.988
- What are you doing?!
- He's being an asshole.

01:28:41.082 --> 01:28:42.686
- Hey, stop!
- Who are you, by the way?

01:28:42.784 --> 01:28:43.990
- Hey, take it easy.
- Who are you?

01:28:44.085 --> 01:28:45.826
Who am I? I'm a doctor.
I'm Dr. Feinberg.

01:28:45.921 --> 01:28:49.368
You're fuckin' Dr. Feinberg?
You've been e-mailing my wife?

01:28:49.457 --> 01:28:51.630
- Excuse me?
- You're the guy e-mailing my wife?

01:28:51.693 --> 01:28:53.764
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Stop it!

01:28:53.829 --> 01:28:56.173
Don't! Don't! Don't!

01:28:56.264 --> 01:28:58.505
- I'm gonna hit you in five seconds.
- No one is hitting anybody.

01:28:58.600 --> 01:28:59.977
I'm gonna hit you in five seconds...

01:29:00.035 --> 01:29:02.208
- I'm gonna hit you in Eve seconds!
- Mimi, call the cops.

01:29:02.304 --> 01:29:04.341
- Five! Four!
- They're coming!

01:29:04.439 --> 01:29:06.385
- Will you take it easy?
- Get out!

01:29:06.474 --> 01:29:08.715
- Get out!
- Take it outside, my friend!

01:29:08.810 --> 01:29:11.017
- Two!
- Think about your wife, will you?

01:29:12.647 --> 01:29:15.321
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- You fucking son of a bitch!

01:29:15.383 --> 01:29:18.796
- I'm sorry... Look...
- I'm so sorry!

01:29:18.854 --> 01:29:21.198
- I'm so sorry.
- Buddy, get up. Just get up.

01:29:21.289 --> 01:29:22.324
What the fuck is the matter with you?

01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:24.734
You got a glass jaw or something?
You can't take one hit?

01:29:24.826 --> 01:29:26.203
- All right, that's enough!
- it's one hit!

01:29:26.294 --> 01:29:27.796
What is wrong with you?

01:29:27.863 --> 01:29:30.002
Oh, my God, you fucking son of a bitch!

01:29:30.065 --> 01:29:31.840
You fucking asshole!

01:29:31.900 --> 01:29:33.243
I'm gonna kill you!

01:29:33.335 --> 01:29:34.973
- You son of a bitch!
- That's enough,

01:29:35.036 --> 01:29:36.515
You son of a bitch!

01:29:36.571 --> 01:29:38.744
- I fucking hate you!
- You two, break it up.

01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:40.547
- That's enough.
- Stop it! Don't. Don't.

01:29:40.642 --> 01:29:41.882
Mimi, please!

01:29:41.977 --> 01:29:44.981
Cindy, would you get out
of here? You are done here, get out!

01:29:45.046 --> 01:29:46.548
- Get out! You're done!
- I'm trying to take him!

01:29:46.648 --> 01:29:49.390
She's done'?! You're gonna fire my wife'?!

01:29:49.918 --> 01:29:52.762
Hey! This is between
you and me, motherfucker.

01:29:52.854 --> 01:29:54.561
Don't you fucking
blame her for that shit!

01:29:54.656 --> 01:29:57.034
- Yeah, you're going to jail, my friend.
- I'm going to jail?

01:29:57.092 --> 01:30:00.164
- Please, come with me!
- Just get the hell out of here!

01:30:00.228 --> 01:30:02.401
- That's it. Keep moving!
- Come on!

01:30:09.604 --> 01:30:11.106
Give me the keys.

01:30:15.677 --> 01:30:17.350
I fucking want a divorce!

01:30:47.809 --> 01:30:49.914
Where are you going'?!

01:30:51.212 --> 01:30:53.055
What the fuck are you doing!'?

01:31:35.824 --> 01:31:37.098
- Hey.
- Mr. Heller.

01:31:37.158 --> 01:31:38.796
- You must be Dean.
- Yeah,

01:31:39.361 --> 01:31:42.342
I didn't know if it was pot luck,
so I brought an eggplant.

01:31:43.264 --> 01:31:46.006
- Very funny. Come in.
- Thank you.

01:31:53.308 --> 01:31:54.514
Let me see. Let me see.

01:31:54.609 --> 01:31:55.986
I don't know what you're talking about.
See what?

01:31:56.044 --> 01:31:57.523
- Let me see.
- See me through the flowers?

01:31:57.612 --> 01:31:59.614
- Do you like 'em'?
- Oh, babe.

01:32:02.484 --> 01:32:04.122
- Does it hurt?
- Yeah.

01:32:04.185 --> 01:32:05.630
Like right now, when you're doing that.

01:32:05.687 --> 01:32:07.166
- Sorry!
- Yeah.

01:32:07.722 --> 01:32:10.566
Cindy doesn't usually bring
her boyfriends home for dinner.

01:32:11.359 --> 01:32:14.966
So... I'm thinking
this might be serious.

01:32:17.866 --> 01:32:19.971
- Don't listen to him.
- Well, I hope so.

01:32:21.569 --> 01:32:23.708
- You hope so.
- Yes, sir.

01:32:23.805 --> 01:32:27.309
- Mmm...
- I mean, I'm pretty serious.

01:32:29.377 --> 01:32:31.323
What do your folks do, Dean?

01:32:31.379 --> 01:32:33.859
Well... I don't know...

01:32:33.915 --> 01:32:38.489
My mother, I don't know,
to be honest, what she does.

01:32:39.087 --> 01:32:42.068
But my father is a janitor...

01:32:43.158 --> 01:32:46.105
,Hand he's a very talented musician.

01:32:46.895 --> 01:32:49.398
- What does he play?
- Everything.

01:32:49.497 --> 01:32:52.740
He can kind of play
a little bit of everything.

01:32:52.834 --> 01:32:54.745
He's one of those people.

01:32:55.837 --> 01:32:58.443
- So you don't see your mother?
- No, I don't.

01:32:58.540 --> 01:33:00.747
Why?
Not that it's my business...

01:33:00.842 --> 01:33:03.516
No, I understand you asking.

01:33:05.246 --> 01:33:07.852
I don't really talk about it very often,
to be honest.

01:33:09.517 --> 01:33:11.588
You know, she just...

01:33:11.686 --> 01:33:16.760
When I was ten, she...
my father and her just decided

01:33:16.858 --> 01:33:20.931
that it wasn't, you know, gonna work out

01:33:21.029 --> 01:33:23.202
and she...

01:33:23.264 --> 01:33:25.938
...she met somebody, and I think...

01:33:27.469 --> 01:33:28.914
...that was that.

01:33:30.605 --> 01:33:32.607
You graduate
from high school, Dean?

01:33:32.707 --> 01:33:35.153
Well, sir, no, I didn't, I didn't.

01:33:36.277 --> 01:33:38.086
But, you know, I didn't feel like...

01:33:38.146 --> 01:33:40.717
...there was a place for me there,
to be honest.

01:33:40.782 --> 01:33:44.992
I don't think that high school
is all it's cracked up to be.

01:33:48.590 --> 01:33:51.230
Cindy's... studying.

01:33:52.827 --> 01:33:56.468
- I know. She-'s...
- it's exciting.

01:33:56.564 --> 01:33:59.272
She's about the smartest person
I ever met.

01:34:00.001 --> 01:34:01.412
How's it going?

01:34:03.404 --> 01:34:04.940
- it's good.
- Yeah?

01:34:05.006 --> 01:34:07.646
Mm-hmm. It's really good. Um...

01:34:08.776 --> 01:34:13.919
There's one teacher in particular that
I've really enjoyed getting to know.

01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:18.754
She says that I have a lot of potential.

01:34:18.820 --> 01:34:20.197
What's her name?

01:34:20.822 --> 01:34:22.859
- Professor Comstock.
- Comstock!

01:34:22.957 --> 01:34:27.997
- What's so funny about that?

01:34:28.796 --> 01:34:30.969
Teachers, they just always
have these names you know?

01:34:31.032 --> 01:34:36.175
It's never like... I don't know".
They always have these names. Comstock.

01:34:36.271 --> 01:34:38.342
- Is that funny?
- Yeah.

01:34:38.439 --> 01:34:40.942
I don't know why, sorry. So you...

01:34:41.009 --> 01:34:45.480
- What course is that?
- it's a biology course,

01:34:47.115 --> 01:34:48.526
That's good.

01:34:48.616 --> 01:34:50.118
Cindy wants to be a doctor.

01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:54.358
I know, that's...

01:34:54.455 --> 01:34:57.561
She'd be a great doctor.
I wish She'd be my doctor.

01:34:59.294 --> 01:35:00.864
I'd trust her.

01:35:00.962 --> 01:35:03.499
A lot of these doctors,
they're just in it for the money.

01:35:03.565 --> 01:35:06.512
It would make me relieved to know
that someone like Cindy

01:35:06.568 --> 01:35:09.048
was my doctor, or my kid's doctor.

01:35:09.971 --> 01:35:13.646
She's got a lot ahead of hen
It's really exciting.

01:35:16.811 --> 01:35:20.486
- You know I'm not good enough for you.
- Stop it.

01:35:20.548 --> 01:35:21.891
- It's true.
- Stop it.

01:35:21.983 --> 01:35:23.724
- Baby, it's true.
- No, it's not.

01:35:23.818 --> 01:35:26.230
- It is true.
- You're hurting my feelings.

01:35:26.321 --> 01:35:28.164
- Don't say that.
- No, but nobody is.

01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:34.738
You know, so as long as..,
that's the case, I want the job.

01:35:40.702 --> 01:35:41.840
Baby...

01:35:42.503 --> 01:35:44.176
- What?
- I got you a present.

01:35:46.007 --> 01:35:48.453
That's it. Hold on... Boom!

01:35:49.344 --> 01:35:52.086
- Oh, baby...
- Mmm?

01:35:52.947 --> 01:35:54.290
Did you make it?

01:35:54.382 --> 01:35:57.226
Well, I didn't make it,
but I got us a song.

01:35:58.853 --> 01:36:01.231
You know, like our song
that will just be for you and me.

01:36:03.558 --> 01:36:07.267
Because everybody's got songs, but
they're lame and they all share them.

01:36:07.362 --> 01:36:09.205
You know, it's disgusting.

01:36:09.797 --> 01:36:12.641
- Not us. We have our own song.
- We have our own song.

01:36:13.635 --> 01:36:16.138
- What is it?
- Do you wanna listen to it?

01:36:25.113 --> 01:36:26.717
OK, turn it up.

01:36:29.984 --> 01:36:33.431
- Stop it.
- Take it easy.

01:36:34.922 --> 01:36:36.230
Listen.

01:38:02.810 --> 01:38:05.984
Baby! Hi!

01:38:08.483 --> 01:38:10.019
Look at you.

01:38:17.925 --> 01:38:19.165
Oh...

01:38:21.829 --> 01:38:23.240
Hi.

01:38:24.999 --> 01:38:27.275
- Are you OK?
- I don't want to talk to you.

01:38:35.843 --> 01:38:37.584
I can't play right now, OK?

01:38:40.348 --> 01:38:42.225
What's going on, Dean?

01:38:45.019 --> 01:38:46.362
Dean, leave her alone.

01:38:50.024 --> 01:38:53.403
Hey! You can't lock me
out of my own house!

01:38:54.262 --> 01:38:57.266
I don't have my oxygen out here! Hey!

01:39:29.730 --> 01:39:31.266
You know, it's not just us.

01:39:31.332 --> 01:39:33.642
We got a little girl
we gotta think about.

01:39:38.406 --> 01:39:41.751
I know, I am thinking about her.

01:39:47.248 --> 01:39:48.989
I can't do this anymore.

01:39:54.455 --> 01:39:57.766
Baby, you're just thinking
about yourself. What about Frankie?

01:40:00.495 --> 01:40:02.441
You want her to grow up
in a broken home?

01:40:03.965 --> 01:40:07.606
- is that what you want?
- I am thinking about Frankie.

01:40:08.369 --> 01:40:09.609
You're not
thinking about Frankie.

01:40:09.704 --> 01:40:11.877
- I am thinking about...
- No, you're not.

01:40:16.310 --> 01:40:18.483
Is this how you want her to grow up?

01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:20.691
I don't want her
to grow up in a home

01:40:20.781 --> 01:40:23.227
where her parents
treat each other like this.

01:40:24.952 --> 01:40:26.625
Don't...

01:40:28.856 --> 01:40:30.392
I'm sorry...

01:40:30.958 --> 01:40:32.631
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:40:34.996 --> 01:40:38.068
- Baby, I'm sorry.
- I can't do this anymore!

01:40:39.967 --> 01:40:41.344
I know.

01:40:43.871 --> 01:40:47.683
Baby, I'm just fighting, you know,
fighting for my family.

01:40:50.811 --> 01:40:53.257
I don't know what to do.

01:40:53.347 --> 01:40:54.985
I don't know what else to do.

01:40:55.550 --> 01:40:57.052
Tell me what to do.

01:40:58.719 --> 01:41:00.562
- Tell me what to do.
- I don't know what to do.

01:41:00.655 --> 01:41:02.657
- Tell me how I should be.
- I don't know.

01:41:02.990 --> 01:41:05.493
Just tell me, I'll do it.

01:41:07.828 --> 01:41:09.330
I'll do it.

01:41:11.165 --> 01:41:13.668
I don't know what to say.

01:41:14.669 --> 01:41:16.876
I'm so sorry,
I don't know what else to do.

01:41:16.938 --> 01:41:20.044
I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it.
Just tell me.

01:41:20.107 --> 01:41:22.383
We're not good together,
we're not good anymore.

01:41:22.443 --> 01:41:24.753
- The way that we treat each other!
- Don't say that, baby.

01:41:24.845 --> 01:41:27.917
I can't stop, you can't stop!

01:41:28.015 --> 01:41:29.961
I can't stop!
I don't know what else to do!

01:41:30.051 --> 01:41:32.361
- I can stop, and I will stop.
- No!

01:41:33.754 --> 01:41:36.564
- No. No.
- Come here, just come here.

01:41:36.624 --> 01:41:40.128
- Come here, come here, come here...
- No, no, no...

01:41:50.404 --> 01:41:52.714
Just come here. Just come here.

01:41:53.441 --> 01:41:54.715
No...

01:42:47.862 --> 01:42:49.432
What are you thinking about?

01:42:53.267 --> 01:42:55.975
I just wish they'd hurry up
so you can't change your mind.

01:42:56.771 --> 01:42:58.944
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

01:43:02.777 --> 01:43:05.155
Baby, you made a promise to me, OK?

01:43:07.048 --> 01:43:09.528
You said for better or worse.

01:43:10.484 --> 01:43:12.293
You said that.

01:43:13.621 --> 01:43:16.795
You said it. It was a promise.

01:43:18.359 --> 01:43:20.168
I'm sorry.

01:43:20.227 --> 01:43:22.503
Now, this is my worst.

01:43:23.964 --> 01:43:26.069
OK? This is my worst.

01:43:26.634 --> 01:43:27.977
I'm sorry.

01:43:28.803 --> 01:43:30.805
But I'm gonna get better.

01:43:31.872 --> 01:43:34.318
You just got to give me
a chance to get better.

01:43:40.581 --> 01:43:42.492
- Up here, please.
- OK.

01:43:42.550 --> 01:43:44.530
- Please face one another.
- OK.

01:43:48.989 --> 01:43:50.559
I'm so sorry...

01:43:56.497 --> 01:43:58.499
I love you so much.

01:43:58.566 --> 01:44:00.443
Dean, I give you this ring...

01:44:00.534 --> 01:44:01.740
...as a symbol...

01:44:03.070 --> 01:44:05.243
- ...as a symbol."
- ...of my solemn vow...

01:44:05.740 --> 01:44:08.584
- ...of my solemn vow...
- ...and everlasting love.

01:44:08.676 --> 01:44:10.713
...and everlasting love.

01:44:10.778 --> 01:44:14.521
For as much as you have
consented in holy wedlock before God...

01:44:15.616 --> 01:44:19.189
...I do, by the power vested in me,
by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,

01:44:19.253 --> 01:44:21.563
pronounce you husband and wife.

01:44:21.622 --> 01:44:23.101
You may kiss the bride.

01:44:52.586 --> 01:44:56.227
- Baby, baby, baby, baby...
- You've gotta just give me some space.

01:44:57.124 --> 01:44:58.899
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:45:31.759 --> 01:45:33.602
Hey, Frankie, come back!

01:45:36.931 --> 01:45:39.537
Daddy! Daddy!

01:45:40.334 --> 01:45:41.779
Daddy!

01:45:43.437 --> 01:45:45.678
Frankie, you got to go back, OK?

01:45:47.474 --> 01:45:49.385
Daddy!

01:45:53.514 --> 01:45:56.654
- Where is she?
- She ran after Dean.

01:46:08.662 --> 01:46:10.642
Go back to your mom, please.

01:46:10.698 --> 01:46:13.372
Don't go. Stay here.

01:46:13.467 --> 01:46:15.504
- Go back to your mom.
- Just come back!

01:46:16.637 --> 01:46:18.742
- You want to race?
- OK.

01:46:18.839 --> 01:46:20.409
One, two, three, go!

01:46:29.984 --> 01:46:34.262
- Oh, sweetheart, it's OK.

01:46:37.892 --> 01:46:39.394
Who's my big girl?

01:46:40.761 --> 01:46:43.367
- I love him.
- I know, baby.

01:46:45.666 --> 01:46:47.942
I got you. Don't cry.

01:46:48.535 --> 01:46:49.843
It's OK.

01:48:55.963 --> 01:48:57.374
OK.

01:48:57.965 --> 01:48:59.467
I can't really sing.

01:48:59.533 --> 01:49:03.379
I have to sing goofy in order to sing.
Like, I have to sing stupid.

01:49:03.470 --> 01:49:04.881
- OK?
- OK.

01:49:47.614 --> 01:49:49.355
You're actually good.

01:49:51.852 --> 01:49:54.924
OK slow dance.
Slow dance to this pan.

01:50:27.754 --> 01:50:29.097
Good job.

01:50:32.059 --> 01:50:34.130
You got some pretty sexy moves.

01:50:34.828 --> 01:50:36.307
Hey, shut up.
