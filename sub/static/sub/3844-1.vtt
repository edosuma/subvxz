SOLARIS

Part One

07:25.695 --> 07:27.738
Kris, come here!

07:28.782 --> 07:30.908
You're just in time.

07:30.992 --> 07:34.036
He takes a walk every morning
for at least an hour.

07:34.162 --> 07:36.956
I forbade him to come back earlier.

07:37.040 --> 07:40.126
He's had a lot of work,
sometimes staying up all night.

07:40.210 --> 07:42.795
These Solarists!

07:43.672 --> 07:48.092
He reminds me of a bookkeeper,
preparing his accounts.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.470
We expected you yesterday.

07:51.555 --> 07:54.140
He wanted to run away
when he saw me.

07:57.686 --> 08:05.234
Hello.

08:10.323 --> 08:13.367
I probably shouldn't have
bothered you today.

08:17.581 --> 08:21.500
How old you and I have become.
I've only just realized that.

08:22.419 --> 08:24.670
What are you apologizing for?

08:24.921 --> 08:26.839
Does he understand
that everything depends

08:26.923 --> 08:28.841
on his first report
from the station?

08:28.925 --> 08:32.761
Everything we've received so far
has been confusing or incomprehensible.

08:33.096 --> 08:35.848
If he confirms that the work
can't continue for some reason,

08:35.932 --> 08:39.476
the station can be taken
out of Solaris' orbit.

08:41.104 --> 08:43.355
He understands.

08:43.773 --> 08:46.150
You promised to talk to him.
I brought the film.

08:46.234 --> 08:49.278
That's what I came here for.
- Yes, of course.

08:50.822 --> 08:54.533
Can the boy stay with you
for a few days?

08:54.784 --> 08:57.578
I have a lot to do
and no one to leave him with.

08:57.829 --> 09:02.166
Anna will look after him.
She'll have more free time now.

09:11.176 --> 09:13.761
When does he leave?

09:13.970 --> 09:17.306
He'll be gone by tomorrow morning.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.986
It's so pleasant here.

09:31.947 --> 09:35.824
This house reminds me
of my grandfather's house.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.660
I really liked it.

09:37.911 --> 09:41.247
So we decided
to build one just like it.

09:42.165 --> 09:44.500
I don't like innovation.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.919
I'd better get going.

11:13.423 --> 11:15.549
I have a lot to do.

11:18.636 --> 11:21.388
Don't you want to see this?

11:21.473 --> 11:23.932
I've already seen it many times.

11:28.104 --> 11:30.356
On the 21st day of our expedition,

11:30.440 --> 11:32.691
radiobiologist Vishyakov
and physicist Fekhner

11:32.776 --> 11:38.781
went on an exploratory flight
over the Solaris Ocean in a hydroplane.

11:39.574 --> 11:43.535
When they failed to return after
16 hours, we declared an emergency.

11:43.620 --> 11:47.289
The fog was thick and we were forced
to call the search off.

11:48.083 --> 11:50.834
All of the rescue craft
returned to the station

11:50.919 --> 11:55.381
except for the helicopter
operated by Burton.

11:56.049 --> 11:59.385
Burton returned an hour after dark.

11:59.636 --> 12:02.679
Once out of the helicopter,
he ran to his quarters.

12:03.723 --> 12:06.225
He was in a state of shock.

12:06.726 --> 12:09.103
This was highly unusual

12:09.187 --> 12:14.733
for a man with 11 years
of experience flying in space.

12:14.818 --> 12:16.527
He recovered in a couple of days,

12:16.611 --> 12:19.488
but he would never leave the station

12:19.572 --> 12:23.534
and refused to approach the window
overlooking the Ocean.

12:23.785 --> 12:26.120
Later he wrote to us from the clinic.

12:26.204 --> 12:30.624
He was preparing a statement
of great importance,

12:30.708 --> 12:33.877
one that would decide
the fate of Solaristics.

12:33.962 --> 12:37.756
Excellent.
Let's hear what he has to say.

12:40.844 --> 12:44.680
At this time,
let us give the floor to Burton.

12:45.181 --> 12:47.099
Thank you.

12:54.482 --> 12:58.193
When I first descended
below 300 meters,

12:58.695 --> 13:01.155
I had trouble maintaining altitude.

13:01.239 --> 13:03.198
There was a strong wind.

13:06.035 --> 13:09.663
All of my attention went towards
operating the ship.

13:10.540 --> 13:14.293
I did not look out of the cabin.

13:15.420 --> 13:20.090
As a result, I wound up in a fog.
- Was it an ordinary fog?

13:20.175 --> 13:23.635
Of course not.

13:23.720 --> 13:27.389
It seemed to be colloidal and viscous.

13:28.391 --> 13:30.851
It coated all of the windows.

13:31.728 --> 13:37.274
Because of the fog's resistance,
I began to lose altitude.

13:38.735 --> 13:40.694
I couldn’t see the sun,

13:40.778 --> 13:44.239
but the fog glowed red
in its direction.

13:46.201 --> 13:50.078
After half an hour
I came out into a large, open space.

13:50.538 --> 13:55.083
It was almost round,
a few hundred meters across.

13:57.462 --> 14:02.591
At that point,
I noticed a change in the Ocean.

14:03.259 --> 14:05.594
The waves disappeared.

14:05.762 --> 14:09.181
The surface became almost transparent,
with clouded patches.

14:09.766 --> 14:12.768
Yellow sludge gathered beneath it.

14:13.853 --> 14:19.816
It rose up in thin strips
and sparkled like glass.

14:20.360 --> 14:25.113
Then it began to seethe,
boil and harden.

14:25.323 --> 14:28.617
It looked like molasses.

14:29.702 --> 14:34.915
This sludge or slime
gathered into large lumps

14:35.542 --> 14:39.336
and slowly formed
different shapes.

14:40.129 --> 14:43.215
I was being drawn into the fog,

14:43.424 --> 14:45.926
so I had to struggle
against this for some time.

14:47.428 --> 14:52.641
When I looked down again,
I saw a sort of garden.

14:52.976 --> 14:54.476
A garden?

14:55.895 --> 14:58.522
Attention, please.

14:58.606 --> 15:03.402
I saw shrubs, hedges,
acacia trees, little paths.

15:03.486 --> 15:05.696
Everything was made
of the same substance.

15:05.780 --> 15:09.908
Did these trees and plants
have leaves?

15:10.743 --> 15:13.620
These shrubs and acacias?

15:13.705 --> 15:17.833
No, I already said they were all made
of plaster, but life-sized.

15:18.918 --> 15:22.254
Then everything began
to crack and break.

15:24.007 --> 15:27.676
Yellow sludge poured out of the fissures.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.971
Everything began to boil even harder,
and foam appeared.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.392
You can see for yourselves.

15:35.476 --> 15:37.603
I used a camera from time to time.

15:37.687 --> 15:42.065
Everything I saw before and after
should be on film.

15:42.317 --> 15:45.986
Then I propose we interrupt
these discussions

15:46.237 --> 15:50.532
and see everything with our own eyes.

15:51.951 --> 15:56.788
All right, show us your film.
This is very interesting.

17:35.096 --> 17:36.930
Is that it?

17:37.473 --> 17:39.266
That's all of your film?

17:39.809 --> 17:41.601
Yes, that's everything.

17:42.019 --> 17:46.022
But we don't understand.
You filmed clouds.

17:47.275 --> 17:49.609
Why did you film clouds?

17:49.694 --> 17:53.196
That must be the fog
I told you about.

17:56.534 --> 17:58.744
I wasn't expecting this.

18:01.247 --> 18:04.916
All of this could be the result
of Solaris' biomagnetic current

18:05.001 --> 18:07.169
acting on Burton's consciousness.

18:07.336 --> 18:11.173
We now know the current is not only
a gigantic cerebral system,

18:11.257 --> 18:13.675
but a substance capable
of thought processes.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.386
That hypothesis is questionable.

18:17.680 --> 18:20.682
Were you feeling sick that day?

18:21.309 --> 18:24.394
The next part is meaningless.

18:29.317 --> 18:31.151
Let's pick up here.

18:31.235 --> 18:34.654
I discovered something floating
in one of the openings.

18:36.199 --> 18:39.326
It looked like Fechner's space suit.

18:39.577 --> 18:43.205
Its shape was that of a person.

18:44.290 --> 18:48.001
I turned around -
I didn't want to lose sight of that spot.

18:49.045 --> 18:53.006
At that moment,
the figure rose slightly,

18:53.841 --> 18:58.428
as if it were swimming
or treading the waves.

19:01.766 --> 19:05.644
This person had no space suit,
and he was moving.

19:05.728 --> 19:07.687
I don't understand. "Person"?

19:08.397 --> 19:10.732
Yes, person.

19:13.236 --> 19:16.571
Just a minute.
Did you see his face?

19:16.656 --> 19:18.073
Yes.

19:23.913 --> 19:26.248
What person?

19:30.586 --> 19:32.838
Who was it?

19:34.590 --> 19:36.633
It was a child.

19:36.717 --> 19:39.678
What child?
Had you seen him before?

19:39.762 --> 19:43.682
No, never.
In any case, not that I remember.

19:44.892 --> 19:47.269
When I flew closer to him,

19:48.938 --> 19:51.982
I noticed something awful.

19:52.066 --> 19:53.817
What do you mean?

19:58.197 --> 20:01.074
I couldn't make it out at first.

20:01.534 --> 20:06.830
Then I saw that he was
unusually large. Gigantic.

20:07.456 --> 20:11.960
He was about four meters tall.

20:12.211 --> 20:16.756
He had blue eyes

20:17.258 --> 20:18.884
and dark hair.

20:18.968 --> 20:21.595
Perhaps you're not feeling well?

20:23.931 --> 20:27.726
We’ll postpone the meeting.

20:29.020 --> 20:31.313
I'll continue.

20:37.737 --> 20:41.781
He was naked, absolutely naked,

20:42.408 --> 20:44.701
like a newborn.

20:46.370 --> 20:50.332
He was wet, or rather, slippery.

20:51.042 --> 20:53.001
His skin was shiny.

20:53.336 --> 20:57.672
He rose and fell like the waves,
but he was moving by himself.

20:57.757 --> 21:00.717
It was disgusting.

21:12.313 --> 21:15.982
I'm sorry.
I'll jump ahead a little.

21:16.984 --> 21:19.527
There isn't much more.

21:19.987 --> 21:25.659
Burton's statements appear to be
the result of a hallucinatory complex

21:25.743 --> 21:28.578
brought on
by the planet's atmosphere,

21:28.663 --> 21:30.789
as well as symptoms of depression

21:30.873 --> 21:34.292
exacerbated by inflammation
of the associative zone

21:34.377 --> 21:36.962
of the cerebral cortex.

21:37.046 --> 21:40.256
This report in no way,
or in almost no way,

21:40.341 --> 21:42.717
corresponds with reality.

21:43.594 --> 21:46.054
What do you mean "almost"?

21:46.138 --> 21:48.974
Excuse me, I'm not finished yet.

21:49.058 --> 21:52.852
Professor Messenger
offers a different opinion.

21:52.937 --> 21:58.024
He believes that Burton's statements
could be founded in reality

21:58.109 --> 22:02.404
and merit further study.

22:02.488 --> 22:04.030
That's it.

22:05.574 --> 22:07.993
I saw it all with my own eyes.

22:11.706 --> 22:15.041
I would like to offer
another opinion.

22:15.835 --> 22:19.254
We stand on the brink
of an enormous discovery,

22:19.505 --> 22:24.592
Our decision should not rely
on the observations

22:24.677 --> 22:29.431
of a man without
any scientific qualifications.

22:30.307 --> 22:34.477
Although any researcher
may envy this pilot,

22:34.937 --> 22:39.274
his presence of mind,
his gift of observation.

22:39.984 --> 22:43.528
Moreover, in light
of recent information,

22:44.071 --> 22:49.743
we are morally obligated
to continue the exploration.

22:50.619 --> 22:53.371
I can understand
how Professor Messenger feels.

22:53.456 --> 22:55.165
I understand him.

22:55.249 --> 22:58.293
But let's take a look
at the road we've traveled.

22:58.419 --> 23:04.382
Solaristics is exactly
where it began.

23:04.884 --> 23:08.386
Years of work have been in vain.

23:11.640 --> 23:16.561
Everything we now know
about Solaris is negative

23:17.146 --> 23:22.067
and has come to resemble a mountain
of disjointed, incoherent facts

23:22.151 --> 23:25.653
that strain credulity.

23:26.864 --> 23:30.241
We're in exactly
the same situation today.

23:31.994 --> 23:34.079
Solaristics is degenerating.

23:34.163 --> 23:36.873
But what we're talking about
is far more serious

23:36.957 --> 23:38.625
than just the study of Solaristics.

23:38.876 --> 23:42.545
We're talking about the boundaries
of human knowledge.

23:42.671 --> 23:46.508
Don't you think that
by establishing artificial barriers

23:46.592 --> 23:51.012
we deliver a blow
to the idea of limitless thought?

23:51.639 --> 23:57.352
By limiting our movement forward,
we facilitate moving backwards.

23:57.561 --> 24:00.021
I nevertheless repeat my question.

24:00.231 --> 24:02.107
What do you mean by saying

24:02.191 --> 24:05.110
the report of my observations in almost
no way corresponds with reality?

24:05.820 --> 24:10.698
I saw everything with my own eyes.
What do you mean by "almost"?

24:10.783 --> 24:15.662
"Almost no way" means
that some real phenomena

24:15.746 --> 24:19.040
could have triggered
your hallucinations, Burton.

24:20.793 --> 24:22.877
When it's windy,

24:22.962 --> 24:27.549
it's easy to confuse a swaying bush
with a living being,

24:28.008 --> 24:31.719
to say nothing of a foreign planet.

24:32.012 --> 24:35.557
I meant no offense, Burton.
None.

24:35.724 --> 24:40.186
I'd like to know what impact
Professor Messenger's opinion will have.

24:40.980 --> 24:43.189
Practically none,

24:43.440 --> 24:49.070
which means that exploration
in this area will be discontinued.

24:49.405 --> 24:51.239
Just a moment. Yes...

24:51.323 --> 24:52.907
I'd like to make a statement.

24:52.992 --> 24:55.368
The commission has not offended me,

24:55.452 --> 24:57.453
but it has offended
the spirit of the expedition.

24:57.538 --> 25:00.123
Therefore, I consider it
my duty to announce...

25:02.626 --> 25:05.170
And so on...

25:07.464 --> 25:09.924
Nowadays it's considered
good manners to laugh

25:10.009 --> 25:13.386
when Burton's report is mentioned.

25:15.222 --> 25:17.182
Thank you, Burton.

25:17.266 --> 25:20.894
We've known you for a long time,
but I never knew anything about you.

25:24.315 --> 25:26.691
You know, you were very handsome.

25:26.775 --> 25:30.278
That's not true,
but thanks anyway.

25:30.946 --> 25:32.739
Excuse me.

25:38.370 --> 25:41.331
Well, Kris, what do you think?

25:42.666 --> 25:44.667
If you don't mind,

25:45.753 --> 25:50.131
I'd like to speak to your son alone.

25:50.466 --> 25:54.636
I don't want to look like an idiot
in front of you yet again.

25:56.931 --> 25:59.933
I'll wait for you outside by the swing.

26:05.481 --> 26:07.899
What a ridiculous man.

26:08.025 --> 26:11.277
You have no reason to say that.

26:12.196 --> 26:14.656
He's ill at ease.

26:14.907 --> 26:18.034
He thinks he's getting
in the way of our farewell.

26:21.747 --> 26:23.748
He's a tactful man.

26:23.832 --> 26:27.502
If he decided to come, it's because
he considers this important.

26:29.171 --> 26:33.633
Although, I admit,
I'd rather not see anyone now.

26:33.842 --> 26:36.177
You and I rarely get
a chance to talk.

26:42.643 --> 26:45.270
I'm glad to hear you say that.

26:46.981 --> 26:49.232
Even if it's on the last day.

27:01.537 --> 27:03.705
The last day.

27:06.792 --> 27:12.380
One always feels awful
after a big farewell.

27:14.008 --> 27:15.633
Here comes your aunt.

27:15.718 --> 27:19.053
Let's meet after lunch.
We need to talk.

27:19.346 --> 27:24.183
Why did you have to invite this Burton
today of all days?

27:26.061 --> 27:29.731
Where are the guests going to sleep?
Next to you, or in the room upstairs?

27:31.734 --> 27:34.068
Upstairs, I guess.

27:35.571 --> 27:39.157
Well, I'm off to my meeting
by the swing.

27:39.366 --> 27:41.743
- Maybe...
- Just a moment.

27:44.079 --> 27:46.956
You and your rooms can wait!

27:56.091 --> 27:58.259
Listen, Kris...

28:16.278 --> 28:18.154
What happened?

28:18.572 --> 28:21.532
- What's standing over there?
- What are you afraid of?

28:21.617 --> 28:23.534
In the garage, staring at me.

28:23.619 --> 28:25.203
It's a horse.

28:25.287 --> 28:27.413
Don't. I've seen it already.

28:27.498 --> 28:29.582
Come on.

28:32.211 --> 28:35.713
He's gentle.
Look how beautiful he is.

28:42.513 --> 28:48.226
You understand, I think
Solaristics has reached an impasse

28:48.310 --> 28:51.312
as a result
of irresponsible daydreaming.

28:52.439 --> 28:54.315
I'm interested in the truth,

28:54.400 --> 28:57.485
but you want to turn me
into a biased supporter.

28:59.321 --> 29:02.907
I don't have the right to make decisions
based on impulses of the heart.

29:02.991 --> 29:06.077
I'm not a poet.
I have a concrete goal:

29:06.161 --> 29:09.247
Either stop the research
and remove the station from orbit,

29:09.331 --> 29:13.084
thereby legitimizing
the Solaristics crisis,

29:13.460 --> 29:16.087
or take extreme measures.

29:16.171 --> 29:19.257
Perhaps bombard the Ocean
with heavy radiation.

29:19.341 --> 29:21.384
- Not that!
- Why not?

29:21.468 --> 29:25.847
Didn't you say research
should continue at any price?

29:26.265 --> 29:31.853
You want to destroy that which we are
presently incapable of understanding?

29:33.021 --> 29:37.024
Forgive me, but I am not an advocate
of knowledge at any price.

29:37.776 --> 29:42.238
Knowledge is only valid
when it's based on morality.

29:43.824 --> 29:47.952
Man is the one who renders science
moral or immoral.

29:48.036 --> 29:49.745
Remember Hiroshima.

29:49.830 --> 29:52.206
Then don't make science immoral.

29:52.708 --> 29:54.709
It's strange...

29:57.546 --> 30:00.590
Strange.
There's nothing strange about it.

30:02.551 --> 30:06.679
You yourself can't be sure
that what you saw

30:06.763 --> 30:09.432
wasn't just hallucinations.

30:09.516 --> 30:11.350
Thank you very much.

30:11.435 --> 30:13.811
It's seems there's
nothing more to discuss.

30:18.525 --> 30:20.401
- What happened?
- I'm leaving.

30:20.486 --> 30:22.236
Where are you going?

30:24.573 --> 30:26.741
He's an accountant, not a scientist.
You were right.

30:26.825 --> 30:29.994
You and I are friends, but that doesn't
mean you can say that about him.

30:30.078 --> 30:34.665
Great. You and I have known each other
for 20 years. It had to end someday.

30:35.250 --> 30:37.668
Are you leaving the boy?

30:49.389 --> 30:52.850
What did you have to offend him for?
You're too harsh.

30:52.935 --> 30:57.230
It's dangerous to send
people like you into space.

30:57.314 --> 31:00.775
Everything there is too fragile.
Yes, fragile!

31:00.859 --> 31:04.862
The Earth has somehow
become adjusted to people like you,

31:05.030 --> 31:06.864
although at what sacrifice!

31:07.366 --> 31:11.536
What, are you jealous that he'll be
the one to bury me, and not you?

31:29.429 --> 31:34.433
Thus, it had been established that
the Solaris Ocean is a distinctive brain.

31:35.018 --> 31:38.479
Right after that, an even more daring
hypothesis came out,

31:38.564 --> 31:41.607
suggesting that the Ocean
is a thinking substance.

31:42.651 --> 31:46.320
Incidentally, this hypothesis

31:46.405 --> 31:50.032
still cannot be confirmed or refuted.

31:50.951 --> 31:53.661
It's a program about Solaris.

31:54.830 --> 31:57.873
There are few believers left.

31:57.958 --> 32:01.752
First of all, there are those connected
to the fate of the Solaris station.

32:01.962 --> 32:05.423
On this huge station
built to house 85 people

32:05.507 --> 32:07.258
there is now a crew of three.

32:07.342 --> 32:10.011
They are: astrobiologist Sartorius,

32:10.095 --> 32:12.388
cyberneticist Snaut,

32:13.640 --> 32:16.601
and physiologist Gibarian,
who deal with the problem...

32:18.312 --> 32:20.229
I'm calling from the city.

32:20.439 --> 32:22.231
Burton.

32:23.859 --> 32:27.194
Anna, leave for a minute.
We need to talk.

32:33.744 --> 32:38.998
I didn't talk to Kris
about what was most important:

32:39.666 --> 32:44.545
about Messenger, who voiced
a different opinion at that meeting.

32:45.589 --> 32:50.092
He became very interested in Fechner,
who died in the Solaris Ocean.

32:51.762 --> 32:55.389
It turns out that Fechner
has an orphaned son.

32:55.474 --> 32:58.934
He had left his family.

32:59.394 --> 33:04.607
Messenger and I paid a visit
to Fechner's widow,

33:05.776 --> 33:08.736
and I saw this boy with my own eyes.

33:08.820 --> 33:10.988
You never told me about that.

33:11.073 --> 33:12.740
I never got the chance.

33:13.617 --> 33:16.911
Fine. Go on.

33:17.162 --> 33:22.166
This child was identical
to the one I saw on Solaris.

33:23.126 --> 33:25.878
Of course,
he wasn't four meters tall.

33:26.922 --> 33:30.091
He shouldn't think about this
too much before liftoff,

33:32.344 --> 33:35.096
but he should keep it in mind.

39:22.569 --> 39:24.611
There's no point
in keeping these papers.

39:24.696 --> 39:27.448
The ones to hold on to are in my room.

39:45.467 --> 39:49.803
My research notes, my thesis...
I held on to so much.

39:58.396 --> 40:02.941
If something should happen,
I'll find someone to take care of them.

40:03.693 --> 40:06.111
I'll come up with something.

40:06.279 --> 40:10.074
Don't look for that film.
I'm taking it with me.

40:10.158 --> 40:12.534
Remember?
The one of the bonfire?

40:12.619 --> 40:14.912
Yes, of course.

43:23.935 --> 43:27.020
-Ready, Kelvin?
-Ready, Moddard.

43:27.230 --> 43:29.523
Don't worry about a thing.

43:29.607 --> 43:32.859
Have a great trip.
Send our regards.

43:33.069 --> 43:37.698
-When is liftoff?
-You're already flying, Kris! Take care.

44:10.315 --> 44:13.942
Solaris station! Do something!

44:14.027 --> 44:17.904
I'm losing stability.
This is Kelvin, over.

46:11.686 --> 46:13.979
Hey, where is everyone?

46:14.063 --> 46:16.440
You've got guests.

47:47.114 --> 47:48.949
Dr. Snaut?

48:14.642 --> 48:16.059
Snaut?

48:25.444 --> 48:27.988
I'm Kelvin, the psychologist.

48:29.740 --> 48:33.368
It looks like you weren't
expecting me.

48:35.746 --> 48:38.665
Did you receive the radiogram?

48:42.420 --> 48:46.089
Yes, of course.

49:01.397 --> 49:03.398
What's with you?

49:07.236 --> 49:10.155
Forgive me.

49:12.450 --> 49:15.619
Where's Gibarian?
Where's Sartorius?

49:16.037 --> 49:18.246
Sartorius is in his quarters.

49:18.331 --> 49:20.040
Gibarian is dead.

49:20.166 --> 49:21.958
What do you mean "dead"?

49:25.463 --> 49:28.006
Suicide.

49:31.385 --> 49:33.553
I beg your pardon.

49:33.971 --> 49:36.097
I knew Gibarian
and he would never have...

49:36.182 --> 49:40.935
He was almost always
in a state of deep depression

49:41.604 --> 49:45.940
ever since these disturbances began...

49:50.863 --> 49:54.949
Why don't you go rest, take a bath?

49:55.034 --> 49:59.621
Take any room
and come back in an hour.

50:00.081 --> 50:04.668
I would like to see Gibarian -
I mean, Sartorius.

50:05.002 --> 50:06.544
Later.

50:06.629 --> 50:10.090
I doubt he'd see you now.
He's upstairs, in the laboratory.

50:10.174 --> 50:12.342
Listen, Snaut,

50:12.426 --> 50:17.305
I understand that something extraordinary
has happened and maybe...

50:24.063 --> 50:26.189
Dr. Kelvin...

50:28.901 --> 50:34.447
You understand...
Come back in an hour. Please.

50:36.117 --> 50:38.952
Go and rest.

50:40.287 --> 50:44.958
Listen, there are only three of us:
you, me and Sartorius.

50:45.042 --> 50:47.919
You know us from our photographs.

50:48.003 --> 50:50.964
If you see something
out of the ordinary,

50:51.048 --> 50:55.176
something besides me and Sartorius,
try not to lose your head.

50:55.261 --> 50:56.886
What would I see?

50:56.971 --> 51:00.223
I don't know.
That sort of depends on you.

51:00.307 --> 51:01.975
Hallucinations?

51:02.059 --> 51:05.895
No. Just remember.

51:06.480 --> 51:09.816
- Remember what?
- That we're not on Earth.

51:10.818 --> 51:14.946
You know, it would be better if you
came back in the evening, or at night.

51:15.030 --> 51:18.283
No, let's make it tomorrow morning.

53:01.679 --> 53:05.098
A. GIBARIAN

53:11.230 --> 53:13.356
HUMAN BEING

53:46.307 --> 53:48.308
FOR K. KELVIN

54:06.201 --> 54:08.328
Hi, Kris.

54:15.836 --> 54:18.463
I still have a little time left.

54:18.631 --> 54:21.341
There are some things
I must tell you,

54:21.800 --> 54:24.385
and some things
I must warn you about.

54:24.470 --> 54:28.640
By now you're at the station
and know what happened to me.

54:29.099 --> 54:33.519
If not, Snaut or Sartorius
will tell you.

54:34.521 --> 54:39.067
What happened to me...

54:41.987 --> 54:43.905
is not important.

54:43.989 --> 54:48.117
Or rather, it cannot be explained.

54:48.202 --> 54:52.163
I'm afraid that what happened to me
is only the beginning.

54:54.249 --> 54:56.960
I wouldn't, of course,
want it to happen...

54:57.044 --> 55:01.506
but this could happen to you
and the others.

55:02.800 --> 55:08.429
Here, it could probably
happen to anyone.

55:08.514 --> 55:11.140
Just don't think
that I've lost my mind.

55:11.225 --> 55:14.769
I'm of sound mind, Kris.
Believe me.

55:18.857 --> 55:21.484
After all, you know me.

55:23.779 --> 55:27.740
If I have enough time,
I'lI tell you why I did everything.

55:28.117 --> 55:32.412
I'm telling you this so that,
if it does happen to you,

55:32.496 --> 55:36.416
you’ll know it's not madness.

55:36.500 --> 55:38.543
That's the most important thing.

55:38.627 --> 55:43.172
As for continuing research,

55:43.257 --> 55:46.342
I'm leaning towards
Sartorius' proposal,

55:46.427 --> 55:51.597
subjecting the Ocean's plasma
to heavy radiation.

55:52.891 --> 55:57.020
I know it's prohibited,
but there's no other choice.

55:57.104 --> 55:58.771
We...

55:59.898 --> 56:02.859
You will get mired in it.

56:04.737 --> 56:10.283
It may offer a way
of breaking this deadlock.

56:11.660 --> 56:15.329
This is our only chance
to make contact with this monster.

56:15.414 --> 56:18.124
There is no other choice, Kris.

56:18.584 --> 56:20.793
If...

59:36.490 --> 59:39.867
Dr. Sartorius, I am Kelvin.

59:39.952 --> 59:42.662
I arrived two hours ago.

59:54.466 --> 59:58.511
Listen, this is ridiculous.

1:00:02.182 --> 1:00:05.142
Either open up
or I'll break down the door.

1:00:05.310 --> 1:00:08.896
All right, I'll open the door,
but don't come in.

1:00:08.981 --> 1:00:11.357
I'll come out.
- Fine.

1:00:14.695 --> 1:00:16.988
My name is Kelvin.

1:00:17.990 --> 1:00:19.365
Go on.

1:00:19.449 --> 1:00:21.784
You must have heard of me.

1:00:21.868 --> 1:00:25.037
I work, or worked, with Gibarian.

1:00:25.122 --> 1:00:26.289
Go on.

1:00:26.373 --> 1:00:30.751
Snaut told me about Gibarian.

1:00:31.586 --> 1:00:34.797
Then you already know the story.

1:00:34.881 --> 1:00:37.800
Yes, it's horrible.

1:00:38.593 --> 1:00:41.470
I don't know the details,
but he's dead.

1:00:41.555 --> 1:00:44.849
That's not the problem.
We all die.

1:00:45.017 --> 1:00:49.645
But he insisted on being buried on Earth.
Is space really such a bad grave for him?

1:00:50.397 --> 1:00:53.482
But Gibarian wanted to be
in the ground, with the worms.

1:00:53.567 --> 1:00:56.152
I wanted to disregard it,
but Snaut insisted.

1:00:56.236 --> 1:00:59.488
- Have you ever heard of Burton?
- He was the pilot who...

1:00:59.573 --> 1:01:02.575
Yes, he was in the search party
for Fechner.

1:01:02.659 --> 1:01:05.703
Fechner died a magnificent death,
but Gibarian was a coward.

1:01:05.787 --> 1:01:09.248
There's no point
talking badly of him now.

1:01:10.042 --> 1:01:13.336
It's at least worth talking about duty.

1:01:13.420 --> 1:01:15.171
Duty to whom?

1:01:15.255 --> 1:01:17.256
- To truth.
- You mean to people.

1:01:17.341 --> 1:01:20.134
You won't find truth there. Look.

1:01:25.724 --> 1:01:29.935
Your position is absurd.
Your so-called courage is inhuman!

1:01:30.854 --> 1:01:32.605
You hear me?

1:01:38.612 --> 1:01:42.281
Go away.
You're too impressionable.

1:01:42.366 --> 1:01:45.910
You must get used to everything.
Good day.

1:04:49.678 --> 1:04:52.680
I spoke to Sartorius.

1:04:52.847 --> 1:04:55.140
He's a rotten person.

1:04:55.308 --> 1:04:57.935
He's a very talented scientist.

1:05:04.359 --> 1:05:08.571
I think I'm a little sick.

1:05:09.489 --> 1:05:13.784
There's nothing wrong with you.
You just won't take advice.

1:05:13.868 --> 1:05:18.372
Snaut, aside from the three of us,
is there anyone else on the station?

1:05:18.456 --> 1:05:20.332
Did you see someone?

1:05:22.252 --> 1:05:25.504
What were you warning me about?

1:05:25.589 --> 1:05:27.756
Whom did you see?

1:05:27.841 --> 1:05:31.385
Was it a human being?
Is she real?

1:05:32.554 --> 1:05:36.473
Can she be touched? Wounded?

1:05:38.059 --> 1:05:40.853
You saw her today.

1:05:42.939 --> 1:05:46.066
And you?
Who the hell are you?

1:05:51.781 --> 1:05:53.490
Quiet.

1:06:05.420 --> 1:06:08.380
- Where did she come from?
- Leave me alone.

1:06:11.051 --> 1:06:12.801
You're afraid.

1:06:17.223 --> 1:06:18.891
Don't worry.

1:06:20.852 --> 1:06:23.103
I won't think you're insane.

1:06:23.188 --> 1:06:27.900
Insane?
God, you know absolutely nothing!

1:06:27.984 --> 1:06:29.902
Insane...

1:06:30.737 --> 1:06:33.030
That would be a blessing.

1:06:40.121 --> 1:06:42.081
Listen, Snaut...

1:07:48.815 --> 1:07:50.357
It's all so senseless.

1:07:51.985 --> 1:07:56.196
They won't understand me.
They think I've gone crazy.

1:08:05.582 --> 1:08:07.791
Do you see, Kris,
how it's not entirely absurd?

1:08:07.876 --> 1:08:11.253
I have to do this because
I'm afraid they’ll come in here.

1:08:11.337 --> 1:08:13.213
I mean Snaut and Sartorius.

1:08:13.298 --> 1:08:15.924
They themselves don't understand
what they're doing.

1:08:16.009 --> 1:08:18.510
I'm afraid, Kris...

1:08:19.179 --> 1:08:21.346
I can't...

1:08:22.098 --> 1:08:24.767
Nobody will be able to understand.

1:08:24.851 --> 1:08:28.145
Open up! You hear, Gibarian?
Open up!

1:08:28.229 --> 1:08:32.357
Don't be stupid.
It's just us - Snaut and Sartorius.

1:08:32.442 --> 1:08:34.610
We want to help you.

1:08:34.861 --> 1:08:37.279
They want to help me.

1:08:38.448 --> 1:08:41.116
Just a second. Quit knocking.

1:08:50.710 --> 1:08:53.170
I am my own judge.

1:08:56.382 --> 1:08:58.592
Have you seen her?

1:08:59.260 --> 1:09:03.055
Kris, understand that
this is not madness.

1:09:06.059 --> 1:09:11.063
It has something to do
with conscience.

1:09:21.032 --> 1:09:25.577
I really wanted you
to get here in time, Kris.

1:14:11.322 --> 1:14:13.281
Where did you...?

1:14:17.995 --> 1:14:20.038
It's so nice.

1:14:33.094 --> 1:14:36.680
But... but it's not...

1:14:38.975 --> 1:14:41.560
How did you know where I...?

1:14:41.686 --> 1:14:44.062
What do you mean, "how"?

1:14:50.570 --> 1:14:53.405
Don't, Kris. That tickles.

1:15:05.042 --> 1:15:08.003
Where are my shoes?
- Shoes?

1:15:24.103 --> 1:15:26.938
No. They're not there.

1:15:38.784 --> 1:15:40.619
Who's this?

1:15:59.722 --> 1:16:01.306
Kris...

1:16:03.184 --> 1:16:04.851
it's me.

1:16:14.612 --> 1:16:16.404
You know...

1:16:19.617 --> 1:16:22.118
I have the feeling...

1:16:26.123 --> 1:16:28.375
as if I've forgotten something.

1:16:39.345 --> 1:16:41.513
I can't understand it.

1:16:46.185 --> 1:16:47.811
Do you love me?

1:16:47.895 --> 1:16:52.190
Don't be silly, Ηari.
As if you didn't know.

1:16:52.692 --> 1:16:55.527
I'm going out for a moment.
Wait for me, okay?

1:16:55.611 --> 1:16:59.739
- I'll go with you.
- No, Hari. I'll be back soon.

1:17:01.534 --> 1:17:03.159
No.

1:17:03.244 --> 1:17:05.787
What's with you? Why?

1:17:09.208 --> 1:17:12.377
I don't know. I can't.

1:17:12.461 --> 1:17:14.379
You can't what?

1:17:15.381 --> 1:17:19.843
It feels like I...
I have to see you... all the time.

1:17:21.929 --> 1:17:24.264
What are you, a child?

1:17:24.348 --> 1:17:27.225
I have work to do, Hari.

1:17:34.734 --> 1:17:37.402
I'm behaving foolishly.

1:17:39.363 --> 1:17:41.281
And so are you.

1:17:41.365 --> 1:17:45.493
Running around all disheveled,
like Snaut.

1:17:46.704 --> 1:17:49.456
- Like who?
- Like Snaut.

1:17:51.584 --> 1:17:54.377
Listen, how do you...

1:17:57.965 --> 1:18:01.343
Well, I have to go.
If you want, we can go together.

1:18:02.970 --> 1:18:06.348
But you won't be able to get
into a suit with your dress on.

1:18:06.599 --> 1:18:08.516
Get undressed.

1:18:12.188 --> 1:18:15.106
Kris, help me. I can't undo it.

1:19:01.654 --> 1:19:03.947
Why are you looking at me like that?

1:19:23.259 --> 1:19:27.971
SOLARIS
Part Two

1:20:42.338 --> 1:20:44.172
Get in.

1:20:44.798 --> 1:20:46.591
- What about you?
- I'm right behind you.

1:20:46.675 --> 1:20:48.968
I have to shut the hatch.

1:20:51.764 --> 1:20:54.641
Is everything all right?
Are you comfortable?

1:20:54.725 --> 1:20:57.018
Yes. Hurry, Kris.

1:23:11.654 --> 1:23:13.529
You could at least knock.

1:23:13.614 --> 1:23:16.532
It sounded
like you were talking to someone.

1:23:16.867 --> 1:23:18.826
All the more reason.

1:23:19.036 --> 1:23:20.953
So you had guests?

1:23:21.038 --> 1:23:24.874
Well, I see you took
good care of them.

1:23:26.377 --> 1:23:29.796
It's nothing.
You won't die from it.

1:23:30.589 --> 1:23:33.174
Did you at least start out modestly?

1:23:33.342 --> 1:23:37.303
Narcotics, poisons, barbiturates, eh?

1:23:37.888 --> 1:23:41.140
If you plan to clown around,
you might as well leave.

1:23:41.225 --> 1:23:44.727
Sometimes you become a clown
without wanting to.

1:23:44.812 --> 1:23:49.023
Don't tell me you haven't tried
a rope or a hammer.

1:23:49.650 --> 1:23:53.528
Did you happen to throw
the inkwell like Luther? No?

1:24:02.162 --> 1:24:04.372
So,

1:24:05.082 --> 1:24:08.501
one, two, and into the rocket,

1:24:08.585 --> 1:24:10.378
and that was that.

1:24:11.130 --> 1:24:14.757
Next time, don't panic.

1:24:15.217 --> 1:24:19.429
And push the button from the corridor.
You could get burned.

1:24:19.930 --> 1:24:22.640
- What was that?
- I don't know.

1:24:22.725 --> 1:24:26.269
Then again, we've managed
to determine a few things.

1:24:27.479 --> 1:24:29.188
Who was it?

1:24:29.273 --> 1:24:32.900
She died 10 years ago.

1:24:33.652 --> 1:24:38.156
What you saw was the materialization
of your conception of her.

1:24:38.782 --> 1:24:41.784
What was her name?
- Hari.

1:24:50.377 --> 1:24:55.840
Everything began after we started
experimenting with radiation.

1:24:56.842 --> 1:25:00.803
We hit the Ocean's surface

1:25:00.888 --> 1:25:03.806
with strong X-ray beams.

1:25:05.309 --> 1:25:06.601
But it...

1:25:06.685 --> 1:25:11.147
Incidentally, consider yourself lucky.
After all, she's a part of your past.

1:25:11.482 --> 1:25:15.443
What if it had been something
you had never seen before,

1:25:15.527 --> 1:25:18.154
but something you had thought
or imagined?

1:25:18.864 --> 1:25:20.448
I don't understand.

1:25:20.532 --> 1:25:24.368
Evidently the Ocean responded to
our heavy radiation with something else.

1:25:24.453 --> 1:25:29.290
It probed our minds and extracted
something like islands of memory.

1:25:34.338 --> 1:25:36.047
Will she come back?

1:25:36.131 --> 1:25:37.715
She will...

1:25:37.841 --> 1:25:39.884
and she won't.

1:25:43.680 --> 1:25:47.016
- Hari the Second.
- There may be an endless number of them.

1:25:47.100 --> 1:25:49.101
Why didn't you warn me?

1:25:49.186 --> 1:25:51.270
You wouldn't have believed me.

1:25:51.355 --> 1:25:56.025
I got scared and acted not entirely...

1:25:56.109 --> 1:25:59.529
Don't be hard on yourself.
We've had enough of Gibarian.

1:26:00.280 --> 1:26:03.449
There's talk about
liquidating the station.

1:26:03.992 --> 1:26:06.661
That's why I was sent here.

1:26:08.038 --> 1:26:12.041
If I submit a report, will you sign it?

1:26:12.251 --> 1:26:15.419
And what if we suddenly make
that long-awaited contact?

1:26:16.588 --> 1:26:22.176
Night is the best time here.
It somehow reminds me of Earth.

1:26:22.761 --> 1:26:26.222
Attach strips of paper
to the air vents.

1:26:28.725 --> 1:26:34.230
At night it sounds like
the rustling of leaves.

1:26:34.898 --> 1:26:38.401
It was Gibarian's invention.
So simple, like all genius.

1:26:38.485 --> 1:26:40.486
I adopted it right away.

1:26:40.571 --> 1:26:45.032
Sartorius made fun of us,
but he has one in his room.

1:26:45.534 --> 1:26:48.327
He hides it in the closet.

1:26:49.705 --> 1:26:52.164
You should rest.

1:26:52.249 --> 1:26:55.918
If you can, come to the library later.

1:26:56.003 --> 1:26:59.255
I've prepared a list of books for you.

1:28:48.907 --> 1:28:51.575
Snaut, is that you?

1:28:58.583 --> 1:29:02.378
Kris, where are you?

1:29:03.672 --> 1:29:05.881
Come here.

1:30:42.187 --> 1:30:45.815
- It's so dark.
- Come here. Don't be afraid.

1:31:42.247 --> 1:31:43.789
Hari!

1:31:43.874 --> 1:31:47.001
The door opens the other way.

1:32:43.892 --> 1:32:46.769
Hang on.
I'll be right back.

1:33:35.652 --> 1:33:39.280
When I saw you weren't there,
I got scared.

1:33:42.575 --> 1:33:44.410
Hello, Kris.

1:33:45.745 --> 1:33:48.497
I can barely hear you.
Speak louder.

1:33:49.374 --> 1:33:51.667
What are you doing right now?

1:33:52.919 --> 1:33:54.878
Nothing.

1:33:55.046 --> 1:33:59.341
Sartorius has invited us
to his laboratory.

1:33:59.801 --> 1:34:01.510
How are you?

1:34:01.594 --> 1:34:04.179
Fine. I'll try to make it.

1:34:18.278 --> 1:34:21.196
Kris, what's wrong with me?

1:34:36.755 --> 1:34:40.299
Maybe it's epilepsy?

1:35:34.938 --> 1:35:36.980
This is my wife.

1:35:38.942 --> 1:35:45.697
Hello.

1:35:47.951 --> 1:35:50.953
- We've been waiting for you.
- I was busy.

1:35:52.622 --> 1:35:56.333
- How lovely! Are these yours?
- No, they're Snaut's.

1:35:57.961 --> 1:36:03.715
So, as far as I can tell,
they are constructed...

1:36:03.800 --> 1:36:05.884
Let's just call them "guests."

1:36:05.969 --> 1:36:07.761
Fine.

1:36:08.221 --> 1:36:13.016
While our structure is made of atoms,
theirs consists of neutrinos.

1:36:13.268 --> 1:36:17.563
But neutrino systems are unstable.

1:36:17.981 --> 1:36:21.483
They seem to be stabilized
by Solaris' force field.

1:36:26.698 --> 1:36:29.366
You've got a superb specimen.

1:36:30.660 --> 1:36:32.911
That's my wife.

1:36:33.121 --> 1:36:35.998
Wonderful. Perfect.

1:36:39.252 --> 1:36:42.546
Then take a blood sample
from your wife.

1:36:42.630 --> 1:36:44.298
Why?

1:36:44.382 --> 1:36:46.592
It'll sober you up a bit.

1:37:21.961 --> 1:37:24.796
What do you think?

1:37:26.382 --> 1:37:28.842
- Snaut?
- Enough of all of you!

1:37:31.054 --> 1:37:34.014
I burned the blood with acid,
but it's restoring itself.

1:37:34.098 --> 1:37:35.682
Regeneration?

1:37:35.767 --> 1:37:41.104
In essence, immortality -
Faust's problem.

1:37:41.189 --> 1:37:42.898
Excuse me.

1:37:47.028 --> 1:37:49.404
There's no need for cotton.

1:37:50.490 --> 1:37:53.492
Are you qualified
to perform an autopsy?

1:37:53.576 --> 1:37:56.662
I've already told you - she's my wife.
Don't you understand?

1:37:56.829 --> 1:38:00.415
I think these experiments are
more humane than testing on rabbits.

1:38:01.167 --> 1:38:02.501
Don't you agree?

1:38:02.585 --> 1:38:04.586
It doesn't matter.

1:38:04.671 --> 1:38:06.880
It would be like
cutting my own leg off.

1:38:08.383 --> 1:38:10.968
Did you feel pain
when you broke through the door?

1:38:11.052 --> 1:38:13.679
Pain? Of course.

1:38:13.972 --> 1:38:17.182
So if I ever catch you doing anything...

1:38:17.267 --> 1:38:19.935
- You're lucky.
- Ηow so?

1:38:20.812 --> 1:38:22.896
It's meaningless,

1:38:22.981 --> 1:38:25.524
yet you've managed to establish
emotional contact with them.

1:38:25.608 --> 1:38:28.819
It may be pleasant...
- What are you, jealous?

1:38:29.112 --> 1:38:30.654
Maybe I'm jealous.

1:38:30.738 --> 1:38:33.365
No, you're not jealous.
After all, you're not guilty of anything.

1:38:33.449 --> 1:38:35.492
- Of course.
- But I am guilty.

1:38:35.577 --> 1:38:37.160
Of what?

1:38:37.453 --> 1:38:41.498
When you turn into an utter cripple
with no arms or legs, call us.

1:38:42.041 --> 1:38:45.377
We'll empty your chamber pot.

1:38:45.628 --> 1:38:49.298
- But whom have you wronged?
- You, among others.

1:39:35.637 --> 1:39:39.056
My father shot that.
Well, I shot a bit.

1:42:34.482 --> 1:42:36.191
Listen...

1:42:53.876 --> 1:42:56.086
I don't know myself at all.

1:42:57.588 --> 1:42:59.673
I don't remember.

1:43:00.758 --> 1:43:05.262
When I close my eyes,
I can't recall my face. And you?

1:43:05.555 --> 1:43:07.305
What?

1:43:08.558 --> 1:43:12.227
- Do you know yourself?
- Like all humans.

1:43:22.488 --> 1:43:26.658
That woman in the white coat hated me.

1:43:26.742 --> 1:43:31.079
Don't make things up.
She died before you and I met.

1:43:33.040 --> 1:43:35.876
I don't understand
why you're deceiving me.

1:43:36.752 --> 1:43:38.962
I remember perfectly.

1:43:39.255 --> 1:43:43.341
We drank tea and she kicked me out.

1:43:44.176 --> 1:43:47.554
Naturally, I stood up and left.
I remember perfectly.

1:43:48.931 --> 1:43:51.182
What happened after that?

1:43:52.768 --> 1:43:54.936
After that, I went away,

1:43:55.479 --> 1:43:58.440
and we never saw each other again.

1:43:58.816 --> 1:44:00.734
Where did you go?

1:44:00.985 --> 1:44:02.944
To a different city.

1:44:03.112 --> 1:44:05.780
- Why?
- I was transferred.

1:44:06.782 --> 1:44:09.284
Why did you leave without me?

1:44:11.370 --> 1:44:13.496
You didn't want to come.

1:44:16.125 --> 1:44:18.335
That I remember.

1:45:16.310 --> 1:45:20.438
Forgive me.
I thought you were already awake.

1:45:20.523 --> 1:45:22.273
What happened?

1:45:22.358 --> 1:45:24.609
The regeneration is slowing down.

1:45:24.694 --> 1:45:28.530
For two or three hours
we can be free of them.

1:45:28.781 --> 1:45:31.741
You came in the middle of the night
to tell me that?

1:45:32.535 --> 1:45:36.454
I'll tell you why I came.

1:45:36.914 --> 1:45:39.416
Sartorius and I were thinking:

1:45:39.875 --> 1:45:44.045
If the Ocean derives guests from us
while we dream,

1:45:44.547 --> 1:45:47.966
maybe it makes sense to transmit
our waking thoughts to it.

1:45:48.175 --> 1:45:51.386
- How?
- With beams of radiation.

1:45:52.179 --> 1:45:55.890
Perhaps it will understand
and spare us from all these apparitions.

1:45:56.017 --> 1:45:59.686
Again these ridiculous X-ray sermons
about the greatness of science?

1:45:59.895 --> 1:46:03.982
We'll modulate the beam
with the brain waves of one of us.

1:46:04.066 --> 1:46:06.443
And "one of us" means me, of course.

1:46:07.486 --> 1:46:11.406
An encephalogram!
A transcription of all my thoughts!

1:46:11.490 --> 1:46:15.910
What if I suddenly want her to die?
To disappear!

1:46:16.078 --> 1:46:19.748
Entrust everything to that...
that mass of jelly?

1:46:19.915 --> 1:46:22.500
It's already invaded my soul.

1:46:22.585 --> 1:46:25.503
Kris, we're running out of time.

1:46:25.588 --> 1:46:30.258
Sartorius has proposed
another project: the annihilator.

1:46:30.468 --> 1:46:34.137
Self-destruction
of the neutrino systems.

1:46:36.223 --> 1:46:38.975
What is this? Blackmail?

1:46:39.268 --> 1:46:42.729
I convinced him to start
with the encephalogram.

1:46:43.147 --> 1:46:47.567
But forget about this for now.

1:46:48.778 --> 1:46:52.781
Tomorrow's my birthday.
Consider yourself invited.

1:46:52.907 --> 1:46:55.700
- Liar! You just want to make up with us.
- Yes, I do.

1:46:55.785 --> 1:46:58.411
Don't shout. She sleeping.

1:47:01.665 --> 1:47:03.458
Sleeping?

1:47:04.293 --> 1:47:07.295
She's already learned how to sleep?

1:47:08.130 --> 1:47:11.007
This will all end badly.

1:47:11.175 --> 1:47:14.094
- Well, what do you propose I do?
- Nothing.

1:47:14.303 --> 1:47:17.680
So you'll come?
Tomorrow, in the library.

1:47:21.477 --> 1:47:24.020
We'll set the table.

1:47:24.563 --> 1:47:29.275
At least there are no windows in there.

1:47:29.610 --> 1:47:31.653
In the meantime, let's go.

1:47:32.321 --> 1:47:34.322
Sartorius is waiting.

1:47:37.326 --> 1:47:38.993
She's sleeping.

1:47:39.161 --> 1:47:41.329
Will she follow me?

1:47:42.331 --> 1:47:44.958
Don't lock the door.

1:47:47.795 --> 1:47:49.546
What door?

1:47:50.673 --> 1:47:53.133
It's just an apparition.

1:48:47.730 --> 1:48:49.731
Wait. I'll be right back.

1:48:50.482 --> 1:48:52.192
Where are you going?

1:49:27.645 --> 1:49:31.105
Forgive me.

1:50:27.204 --> 1:50:29.289
Why aren't you asleep?

1:50:33.294 --> 1:50:36.587
- You don't love me.
- Stop it, Hari.

1:50:39.216 --> 1:50:42.051
- We have to talk.
- About what?

1:50:46.849 --> 1:50:50.143
You understand that I don't know
where I came from.

1:50:50.686 --> 1:50:53.229
Maybe you know?
- What's with you?

1:50:53.314 --> 1:50:55.732
Stop. Don't interrupt.

1:50:57.026 --> 1:50:59.027
If you know,

1:51:00.362 --> 1:51:03.406
but you can't tell me now,

1:51:03.991 --> 1:51:07.035
perhaps one day you will.

1:51:07.703 --> 1:51:09.537
What are you talking about?

1:51:09.705 --> 1:51:12.332
I don't understand a thing, honestly.

1:51:13.500 --> 1:51:15.710
You don't want to tell me.

1:51:17.212 --> 1:51:19.422
You're afraid.

1:51:20.174 --> 1:51:22.884
Then I'll tell you.

1:51:24.762 --> 1:51:26.512
I'm not Ηari.

1:51:27.556 --> 1:51:29.891
Hari is dead.

1:51:30.434 --> 1:51:32.852
She poisoned herself.

1:51:33.979 --> 1:51:36.981
I'm somebody else.

1:51:37.066 --> 1:51:39.108
Who told you this?

1:51:39.735 --> 1:51:42.945
- Sartorius just told me.
- Last night.

1:51:46.867 --> 1:51:49.577
It would have been better
if you had told me yourself.

1:51:49.745 --> 1:51:52.705
My God, what's the difference?

1:51:58.087 --> 1:52:00.755
How have you lived all this time?

1:52:01.799 --> 1:52:03.800
Were you in love with anyone?

1:52:03.884 --> 1:52:05.551
I don't know.

1:52:05.636 --> 1:52:07.470
Did you ever think of me?

1:52:07.679 --> 1:52:10.807
Yes, but not all the time.

1:52:13.018 --> 1:52:15.520
Only when I felt unhappy.

1:52:21.693 --> 1:52:26.406
You know, it feels like
somebody is tricking us.

1:52:28.200 --> 1:52:33.246
And the longer this fog lasts,
the worse it will be for you in the end.

1:52:33.580 --> 1:52:35.957
Particularly for you, Kris.

1:52:37.501 --> 1:52:39.544
How can I help you?

1:52:41.922 --> 1:52:43.423
Tell me.

1:52:43.549 --> 1:52:49.220
And her, the other one,
what happened to her?

1:52:58.147 --> 1:52:59.981
We argued.

1:53:00.858 --> 1:53:03.901
Towards the end, we argued a lot.

1:53:04.111 --> 1:53:07.071
I gathered my things and left.

1:53:08.449 --> 1:53:11.909
She made me understand
without saying it directly,

1:53:12.578 --> 1:53:16.831
but when you live with someone for a
long time, such things aren't necessary.

1:53:18.500 --> 1:53:20.585
I was sure they were just words,

1:53:20.669 --> 1:53:23.754
but then I remembered that I'd left

1:53:25.757 --> 1:53:28.384
the laboratory specimens
in the refrigerator.

1:53:30.012 --> 1:53:34.182
I had brought them from the laboratory
and explained how they worked.

1:53:34.266 --> 1:53:36.017
I got scared.

1:53:36.518 --> 1:53:38.853
I wanted to go to her.

1:53:38.979 --> 1:53:42.815
But then I thought it would look like
I had taken her words seriously.

1:53:43.317 --> 1:53:46.486
After three days, I couldn't take it
anymore and I went to see her.

1:53:46.653 --> 1:53:49.739
When I got there,
she was already dead.

1:53:50.199 --> 1:53:53.034
There was a needle mark on her arm.

1:53:55.412 --> 1:53:57.413
Like this?

1:54:06.048 --> 1:54:08.716
Why did she do it?

1:54:09.885 --> 1:54:14.138
She probably sensed
that I didn't really love her.

1:54:18.560 --> 1:54:20.436
But now I do.

1:54:32.282 --> 1:54:34.283
- Kris.
- What?

1:54:35.244 --> 1:54:37.078
I love you.

1:54:42.626 --> 1:54:44.877
Get some sleep.

1:54:44.962 --> 1:54:46.921
I don't know how to sleep.

1:54:48.715 --> 1:54:54.095
It's not sleep.
It's somehow around me.

1:54:56.557 --> 1:55:01.394
It's as if it weren't just inside of me,
but much farther away.

1:55:02.020 --> 1:55:06.190
It's probably still sleep.

1:55:46.690 --> 1:55:50.151
So, it looks like our guest of honor
isn't showing up.

1:55:54.197 --> 1:55:57.533
- Why?
- Maybe he has guests.

1:56:53.590 --> 1:56:56.425
Oh, everyone's already here?

1:56:59.721 --> 1:57:02.848
You're an hour and a half late.

1:57:09.398 --> 1:57:11.941
What's that you're reading?

1:57:17.614 --> 1:57:19.865
It's all rubbish.

1:57:22.077 --> 1:57:23.911
Rubbish.

1:57:25.747 --> 1:57:27.581
Where the hell is...

1:57:33.422 --> 1:57:35.131
Here!

1:57:38.427 --> 1:57:41.303
"They come at night.

1:57:43.014 --> 1:57:45.975
But one must sleep sometime."

1:57:47.102 --> 1:57:49.478
That's the problem.

1:57:50.814 --> 1:57:54.734
Mankind has lost the ability to sleep.

1:58:00.782 --> 1:58:05.828
You'd better read.
I'm a little excited.

1:58:08.123 --> 1:58:11.083
"I know only one thing, señor.
When I...

1:58:22.637 --> 1:58:26.974
When I sleep, I know no fear,
no hope, no trouble, no bliss.

1:58:27.058 --> 1:58:29.268
Blessings on him who invented sleep.

1:58:31.646 --> 1:58:35.232
The common coin
that purchases all things,

1:58:35.317 --> 1:58:37.359
the balance that levels
shepherd and king,

1:58:37.444 --> 1:58:39.653
fool and wise man.

1:58:39.738 --> 1:58:42.323
There is only one bad thing
about sound sleep.

1:58:42.407 --> 1:58:45.576
They say it closely resembles death."

1:58:45.660 --> 1:58:50.498
"Never before, Sancho, have I heard you
speak so elegantly as now."

1:58:53.418 --> 1:58:58.506
That's great, but perhaps
you'll let me say something now?

1:58:59.508 --> 1:59:02.301
I propose a toast to Snaut,

1:59:02.886 --> 1:59:07.681
to his bravery,
to his devotion to duty.

1:59:07.766 --> 1:59:10.559
To science and to Snaut.

1:59:10.852 --> 1:59:14.146
Science? Nonsense.

1:59:15.357 --> 1:59:21.237
In this situation, mediocrity and genius
are equally useless.

1:59:22.405 --> 1:59:27.701
We have no interest
in conquering any cosmos.

1:59:28.537 --> 1:59:32.706
We want to extend the Earth
to the borders of the cosmos.

1:59:33.375 --> 1:59:35.835
We don't know what to do
with other worlds.

1:59:35.919 --> 1:59:38.504
We don't need other worlds.

1:59:38.630 --> 1:59:41.715
We need a mirror.

1:59:42.050 --> 1:59:46.136
We struggle for contact,
but we'll never find it.

1:59:46.596 --> 1:59:49.139
We're in the foolish human
predicament

1:59:49.224 --> 1:59:53.060
of striving for a goal that he fears,

1:59:53.228 --> 1:59:55.354
that he has no need for.

1:59:56.189 --> 2:00:00.359
Man needs man.

2:00:07.993 --> 2:00:10.286
Let's drink to Gibarian.

2:00:10.453 --> 2:00:12.413
To his memory.

2:00:12.497 --> 2:00:15.666
Even though he got frightened.

2:00:28.263 --> 2:00:31.181
No, Gibarian was not frightened.

2:00:34.477 --> 2:00:37.187
There are worse things.

2:00:39.482 --> 2:00:42.693
He died of hopelessness.

2:00:44.613 --> 2:00:48.032
He thought all this
was happening only to him.

2:00:48.116 --> 2:00:50.159
My God!

2:00:50.952 --> 2:00:53.037
All these heartbreaking lamentations

2:00:53.121 --> 2:00:55.247
are nothing but
second-rate Dostoyevsky.

2:00:56.082 --> 2:00:57.958
Who are you to judge?

2:00:58.043 --> 2:01:00.753
I know why I'm here.
I'm working.

2:01:01.463 --> 2:01:04.089
Man was created by nature
so he could learn her ways.

2:01:06.384 --> 2:01:10.095
In his endless search for the truth,
man is condemned to knowledge.

2:01:10.513 --> 2:01:12.890
Everything else is whim.

2:01:14.309 --> 2:01:16.727
Permit me to ask,
my esteemed colleague:

2:01:16.811 --> 2:01:19.396
Why have you come to Solaris?

2:01:20.398 --> 2:01:24.068
- What do you mean, why?
- Well, are you working a lot?

2:01:24.152 --> 2:01:27.279
Forgive me, but aside from
the romance with your ex-wife,

2:01:27.364 --> 2:01:29.615
nothing seems to interest you.

2:01:29.699 --> 2:01:32.910
You spend all day lounging in
a bed of noble thoughts,

2:01:32.994 --> 2:01:35.913
and that's how
you carry out your duty.

2:01:36.164 --> 2:01:38.999
You've lost touch with reality.

2:01:39.292 --> 2:01:41.502
Forgive me, but you're simply a loafer.

2:01:41.586 --> 2:01:43.170
Enough!

2:01:43.254 --> 2:01:46.924
Let's try to be pleasant.
We'll drink to Gibarian.

2:01:47.008 --> 2:01:49.093
Not to Gibarian, but to Man.

2:01:49.177 --> 2:01:51.303
Are you saying
Gibarian was not a man?

2:01:51.388 --> 2:01:54.848
Stop it, Kris.
Let's not fight.

2:01:55.016 --> 2:01:59.853
After all, it's my birthday.
It's my day.

2:01:59.980 --> 2:02:01.689
Of course.

2:02:02.691 --> 2:02:06.026
I think that Kris Kelvin

2:02:07.195 --> 2:02:10.155
is more consistent than both of you.

2:02:10.281 --> 2:02:13.367
In inhuman conditions,
he has behaved humanely.

2:02:13.451 --> 2:02:16.996
And you act
as if none of this concerns you,

2:02:17.080 --> 2:02:21.959
and consider your guests -
it seems that's what you call us -

2:02:22.043 --> 2:02:25.170
something external, a hindrance.

2:02:25.505 --> 2:02:29.425
But it's a part of you.
It's your conscience.

2:02:33.263 --> 2:02:35.556
And Kris loves me.

2:02:38.893 --> 2:02:41.937
Maybe it's not me he loves,

2:02:42.605 --> 2:02:46.275
but he's simply protecting himself.

2:02:47.360 --> 2:02:49.987
He wants me alive.

2:02:50.739 --> 2:02:53.198
That's not the point.
It doesn't matter why man loves.

2:02:53.283 --> 2:02:55.367
It's different for everyone.

2:02:55.744 --> 2:02:58.412
It's not Kris.

2:02:58.913 --> 2:03:00.622
It's you.

2:03:00.707 --> 2:03:03.625
I hate you all.
- I would ask you...

2:03:03.710 --> 2:03:07.212
Please don't interrupt me.
I'm a woman, after all.

2:03:07.297 --> 2:03:09.339
You're not a woman
and you're not a human being.

2:03:09.424 --> 2:03:11.341
Understand that,

2:03:11.426 --> 2:03:14.344
if you're capable
of understanding anything.

2:03:16.806 --> 2:03:19.808
There is no Hari. She's dead.

2:03:23.021 --> 2:03:26.648
You're just a reproduction,

2:03:27.108 --> 2:03:29.526
a mechanical reproduction.

2:03:29.611 --> 2:03:32.696
A copy. A matrix.

2:03:41.498 --> 2:03:43.123
Yes.

2:03:45.460 --> 2:03:47.419
Maybe.

2:03:56.304 --> 2:03:57.971
But I...

2:03:58.556 --> 2:04:02.101
I am becoming a human being.

2:04:05.730 --> 2:04:08.732
I can feel just as deeply as you.

2:04:10.068 --> 2:04:12.152
Believe me.

2:04:14.322 --> 2:04:17.199
I can already get by without him.

2:04:18.952 --> 2:04:20.369
I...

2:04:23.498 --> 2:04:25.415
love him.

2:04:27.669 --> 2:04:29.962
I am a human being.

2:04:30.672 --> 2:04:32.172
You...

2:04:33.508 --> 2:04:36.093
you're very cruel.

2:05:30.773 --> 2:05:33.358
Get up! Get up right now!

2:05:41.576 --> 2:05:43.660
My dear man.

2:05:49.083 --> 2:05:51.668
Nothing could be easier.

2:05:55.924 --> 2:05:58.592
We've wasted time arguing.

2:05:59.302 --> 2:06:03.931
We're losing our dignity
and human character.

2:06:04.807 --> 2:06:06.266
No.

2:06:06.476 --> 2:06:10.938
You're human, each in your own way.

2:06:12.065 --> 2:06:14.608
That's why you argue.

2:06:16.027 --> 2:06:18.445
I hope I'm not bothering you.

2:06:22.200 --> 2:06:24.701
You're a good man...

2:06:24.994 --> 2:06:28.372
but you look awful.

2:06:35.630 --> 2:06:38.090
I've really lost heart.

2:06:39.259 --> 2:06:42.302
Help me out a bit.

2:06:46.349 --> 2:06:51.561
Doesn't a man
who's ready to give up his life

2:06:51.646 --> 2:06:56.566
just to make cursed contact

2:06:56.651 --> 2:07:00.279
in order to know more about it
have the right to get drunk?

2:07:00.363 --> 2:07:03.824
He has every right.

2:07:05.410 --> 2:07:09.329
Do you believe in our mission, Kelvin?

2:07:10.707 --> 2:07:12.666
I'm not going to bed yet.

2:07:12.875 --> 2:07:15.294
It's important not to fall asleep.

2:07:16.045 --> 2:07:18.714
I'm going to see Faust.

2:07:19.882 --> 2:07:23.760
In the laboratory, our Faust -
Sartorius -

2:07:23.845 --> 2:07:26.847
is seeking a remedy for immortality.

2:07:26.931 --> 2:07:28.807
While we...

2:07:41.946 --> 2:07:47.492
Listen, let's open these hatches
and shout down below.

2:07:47.952 --> 2:07:50.495
It would suddenly hear.

2:07:50.913 --> 2:07:54.541
But what should we call it?

2:07:56.002 --> 2:08:01.131
Maybe we should whip it.

2:08:01.883 --> 2:08:04.468
Or, better yet, pray to it.

2:08:04.552 --> 2:08:06.011
What's wrong?

2:08:06.095 --> 2:08:08.805
I think I shut the door to the library.
She's there alone.

2:08:08.890 --> 2:08:11.266
Go. I feel better already.

2:08:11.351 --> 2:08:13.769
The station is changing its orbit.

2:08:14.270 --> 2:08:19.900
At 5 a.m. there will be
30 seconds of weightlessness.

2:08:20.401 --> 2:08:22.819
Don't forget.

2:11:45.106 --> 2:11:47.941
Forgive me, my darling.
I was lost in thought.

2:11:50.111 --> 2:11:52.487
Is something wrong?

2:11:53.656 --> 2:11:56.783
No, nothing.

2:11:57.952 --> 2:12:00.120
Everything's fine.

2:15:52.561 --> 2:15:54.854
She drank liquid oxygen.

2:15:56.857 --> 2:15:59.526
She did it out of despair.

2:15:59.819 --> 2:16:01.945
It'll get worse.

2:16:02.029 --> 2:16:05.365
The more she's with you,
the more human she'll become.

2:16:05.908 --> 2:16:09.494
Learn from Sartorius' example.
- Thanks for the advice.

2:16:14.124 --> 2:16:16.376
What do you intend to do?

2:16:16.544 --> 2:16:19.379
Wait until she returns.

2:16:19.547 --> 2:16:22.715
And then what?
Leave the station?

2:16:27.096 --> 2:16:32.517
Kris, she can only live here,
on the station. You know that.

2:16:34.061 --> 2:16:36.354
What can I do?

2:16:36.856 --> 2:16:38.565
I love her.
- Which one?

2:16:38.649 --> 2:16:43.778
Her, or the one in the rocket?
You can pull her in from space.

2:16:43.863 --> 2:16:46.447
She will appear again
and she'll keep appearing.

2:16:47.491 --> 2:16:51.244
Don't turn a scientific problem
into a common love story.

2:16:55.332 --> 2:16:58.209
I had a feeling this would end badly.

2:17:02.506 --> 2:17:04.424
You should help her.

2:17:21.233 --> 2:17:23.359
What a ghastly sight.

2:17:24.612 --> 2:17:30.283
I can never get used
to all these resurrections.

2:19:22.771 --> 2:19:24.897
Is it me?

2:19:29.236 --> 2:19:30.403
Hari...

2:19:31.405 --> 2:19:32.864
What?

2:19:39.038 --> 2:19:43.916
Why?

2:19:46.879 --> 2:19:49.797
No, it's not me.

2:19:54.428 --> 2:19:56.846
It's... I'm... not Hari...

2:19:56.930 --> 2:20:01.809
And you... Maybe you...

2:20:02.144 --> 2:20:05.021
- Don't, Ηari.
- I'm not Ηari!

2:20:07.691 --> 2:20:09.984
Fine!

2:20:10.069 --> 2:20:12.737
Maybe your appearance
is supposed to be torture.

2:20:12.821 --> 2:20:14.572
Maybe it's a favor from the Ocean.

2:20:14.656 --> 2:20:19.577
What does it matter
when you're worth more to me

2:20:19.661 --> 2:20:22.038
than any science could ever be?

2:20:22.956 --> 2:20:24.707
Do I look a lot like her?

2:20:24.792 --> 2:20:27.960
No, you looked like her.

2:20:28.045 --> 2:20:31.422
But now you - and not her -
are the real Hari.

2:20:31.507 --> 2:20:34.258
Tell me...

2:20:34.927 --> 2:20:39.222
Do I disgust you? I'm so...

2:20:43.977 --> 2:20:46.938
I disgust you!
- No, Hari. That's not true.

2:20:47.022 --> 2:20:49.232
- You're lying!
- It's not true. Stop it.

2:20:49.316 --> 2:20:51.859
- I must be disgusting!
- Stop it.

2:20:58.951 --> 2:21:00.827
Don't touch me!

2:21:49.960 --> 2:21:52.253
I love you.

2:21:56.466 --> 2:21:58.509
What's the matter?

2:22:02.556 --> 2:22:05.850
Nothing.

2:22:11.773 --> 2:22:14.442
I'm not going back to Earth.

2:22:15.027 --> 2:22:19.238
I'll live here with you on the station.

2:22:20.032 --> 2:22:21.741
You know...

2:22:25.537 --> 2:22:27.914
I'm afraid.

2:24:36.126 --> 2:24:38.794
It looks like it's showing
some activity.

2:24:38.879 --> 2:24:41.547
Your encephalogram helped.

2:24:43.008 --> 2:24:44.717
You know...

2:24:44.885 --> 2:24:49.430
whenever we show pity,
we ravage ourselves.

2:24:49.723 --> 2:24:52.224
Maybe it's true...

2:24:52.392 --> 2:24:57.271
Suffering makes life seem

2:24:57.439 --> 2:24:59.690
dismal and suspect.

2:25:03.737 --> 2:25:06.030
But I won't accept that.

2:25:09.826 --> 2:25:12.411
No, I won't accept that.

2:25:17.084 --> 2:25:22.922
Is that which is indispensable to life
also harmful to it?

2:25:24.091 --> 2:25:28.969
No, it's not harmful.
Of course it's not harmful.

2:25:30.138 --> 2:25:32.348
Remember Tolstoy?

2:25:33.058 --> 2:25:37.812
His suffering over the impossibility
of loving mankind as a whole?

2:25:40.524 --> 2:25:43.859
How much time has passed since then?

2:25:44.444 --> 2:25:48.447
Somehow I can't figure it out.
Help me.

2:25:51.243 --> 2:25:53.244
See, I love you.

2:25:53.328 --> 2:25:57.456
But love is a feeling
we can experience

2:25:57.541 --> 2:26:00.167
but never explain.

2:26:00.460 --> 2:26:02.628
One can explain the concept.

2:26:02.712 --> 2:26:05.756
You love that which you can lose:

2:26:05.841 --> 2:26:09.176
Yourself, a woman, a homeland.

2:26:10.137 --> 2:26:15.349
Until today, love was simply
unattainable to mankind, to the Earth.

2:26:15.434 --> 2:26:17.435
Do you understand me, Snaut?

2:26:17.519 --> 2:26:21.981
There are so few of us.
A few billion altogether. A handful!

2:26:23.442 --> 2:26:27.987
Maybe we're here in order
to experience people

2:26:28.488 --> 2:26:30.156
as a reason for love.

2:26:35.829 --> 2:26:38.122
He seems to have a fever.

2:26:39.458 --> 2:26:44.086
How did Gibarian die?
You still haven't told me.

2:26:44.629 --> 2:26:47.298
I'll tell you. Later.

2:26:48.008 --> 2:26:52.094
Gibarian didn't die of fear.
He died of shame.

2:26:52.179 --> 2:26:57.349
Shame - the feeling
that will save mankind.

2:29:25.415 --> 2:29:27.416
Mama, I...

2:29:30.670 --> 2:29:33.088
I'm two hours late.

2:29:33.173 --> 2:29:34.882
I know.

2:29:36.009 --> 2:29:37.843
How was your trip?

2:29:38.803 --> 2:29:43.682
Fine. I'm a little tired,
but it was fine.

2:29:59.199 --> 2:30:03.952
My God, it's running slow again.

2:30:04.829 --> 2:30:06.497
I'll go adjust it.

2:30:06.581 --> 2:30:08.666
You've got plenty of time.

2:30:36.403 --> 2:30:40.739
You know, it's really embarrassing,
but for some reason...

2:30:44.244 --> 2:30:47.371
I've completely forgotten your face.

2:30:48.206 --> 2:30:50.541
You don't look well.

2:30:52.627 --> 2:30:53.794
Are you happy?

2:30:53.878 --> 2:30:57.589
Somehow that concept
seems irrelevant here.

2:30:58.967 --> 2:31:02.761
That's really a pity.

2:31:06.558 --> 2:31:09.435
I'm very lonesome now.

2:31:21.573 --> 2:31:24.616
Why do you hurt our feelings?

2:31:24.701 --> 2:31:26.493
What have you been waiting for?

2:31:27.620 --> 2:31:30.330
Why haven't you called?

2:31:48.349 --> 2:31:51.310
You're leading
some sort of strange life.

2:31:52.020 --> 2:31:55.355
You're filthy and unkempt.

2:31:57.066 --> 2:31:59.651
Ηow did you make
such a mess of yourself?

2:32:04.741 --> 2:32:06.742
What's this?

2:32:08.495 --> 2:32:10.996
Wait here. I'll be right back.

2:34:08.197 --> 2:34:11.325
How are you?
Everything all right?

2:34:11.409 --> 2:34:13.493
Where's Hari?

2:34:24.797 --> 2:34:26.632
What's that?

2:34:26.883 --> 2:34:29.259
There's no more Hari.

2:34:53.368 --> 2:34:58.580
"Kris, it's terrible that I had
to deceive you,

2:34:58.665 --> 2:35:01.208
but there was no other way.

2:35:02.669 --> 2:35:05.545
This is best for both of us.

2:35:11.260 --> 2:35:14.221
I asked them myself.

2:35:15.223 --> 2:35:18.976
You mustn't blame anyone.

2:35:20.770 --> 2:35:22.646
Hari."

2:35:26.943 --> 2:35:29.319
She did it for you.

2:35:39.789 --> 2:35:42.708
Snaut, listen.

2:35:43.960 --> 2:35:46.378
Later, Kris. Calm down.

2:35:47.046 --> 2:35:50.674
How... how did it...

2:35:52.051 --> 2:35:55.679
The annihilator?
A burst of light and wind.

2:36:05.231 --> 2:36:07.149
Yes.

2:36:07.859 --> 2:36:11.570
Things weren't working out
between us towards the end.

2:36:16.200 --> 2:36:18.368
Listen, Snaut.

2:36:19.078 --> 2:36:22.456
Why are we being tortured like this?

2:36:24.459 --> 2:36:29.171
In my opinion, we have lost
our sense of the cosmic.

2:36:29.589 --> 2:36:31.757
The ancients understood it perfectly.

2:36:31.841 --> 2:36:35.594
They never would have asked
why or what for.

2:36:36.012 --> 2:36:38.764
Remember the myth of Sisyphus.

2:36:40.349 --> 2:36:43.685
Since we transmitted
your encephalogram,

2:36:43.770 --> 2:36:47.272
none of the guests have come back.

2:36:47.440 --> 2:36:51.485
Something incomprehensible is starting
to take place in the Ocean.

2:36:51.611 --> 2:36:54.237
Islands have begun to form
on the surface.

2:36:54.322 --> 2:36:58.241
First one. Then the next day
there were several more.

2:36:58.326 --> 2:37:01.620
Are you trying to tell me
that it understood us?

2:37:02.789 --> 2:37:04.664
That quickly?

2:37:05.083 --> 2:37:09.461
But at least there's hope, eh, Kris?

2:37:17.053 --> 2:37:20.639
- Ηow old are you?
- Fifty-two. Why?

2:37:21.724 --> 2:37:23.809
Have you been here long?

2:37:24.977 --> 2:37:28.355
- You must have seen my forms.
- I did.

2:37:29.565 --> 2:37:34.986
Listen, having spent so many years
here on the station,

2:37:36.197 --> 2:37:40.909
do you still feel a clear connection
to your life down there?

2:37:41.202 --> 2:37:44.037
You like dire questions.

2:37:44.205 --> 2:37:47.582
Soon you'll ask me
about the meaning of life.

2:37:47.667 --> 2:37:50.168
Wait. Don't be ironic.

2:37:50.336 --> 2:37:52.629
It's a banal question.

2:37:53.756 --> 2:37:56.133
When man is happy,

2:37:56.342 --> 2:38:01.513
the meaning of life and other
eternal themes rarely interest him.

2:38:02.890 --> 2:38:06.935
These questions should be asked
at the end of one's life.

2:38:11.190 --> 2:38:15.193
But we don't know when life will end.

2:38:15.278 --> 2:38:17.279
That's why we're in such a hurry.

2:38:17.363 --> 2:38:19.239
Don't rush.

2:38:19.323 --> 2:38:25.328
The happiest people are those who are
not interested in these cursed questions.

2:38:25.413 --> 2:38:28.290
To ask is always
the desire to know.

2:38:28.374 --> 2:38:32.627
Yet the preservation of
simple human truths requires mystery.

2:38:32.879 --> 2:38:36.882
The mysteries of happiness,
death and love.

2:38:37.008 --> 2:38:41.386
Maybe you're right,
but try not to think about all that now.

2:38:42.221 --> 2:38:47.267
To think about it
is to know the day of one's death.

2:38:49.061 --> 2:38:53.398
Not knowing that day
makes us practically immortal.

2:38:58.905 --> 2:39:00.739
Fine, then.

2:39:01.073 --> 2:39:03.867
In any event,
my mission is finished.

2:39:04.035 --> 2:39:07.913
But what next?
Return to Earth?

2:39:08.664 --> 2:39:10.916
Little by little,
everything will return to normal.

2:39:11.000 --> 2:39:13.835
I'lI even find
new interests and acquaintances.

2:39:14.962 --> 2:39:17.923
But I won't be able
to give myself to them fully.

2:39:18.633 --> 2:39:20.508
Never.

2:39:22.887 --> 2:39:25.347
Do I have the right to turn down

2:39:25.431 --> 2:39:30.518
even an imagined possibility
of contact with this Ocean

2:39:31.020 --> 2:39:35.982
which my race has been trying
to understand for decades?

2:39:36.734 --> 2:39:38.693
Should I remain here?

2:39:38.945 --> 2:39:43.281
Among things and objects
we both touched?

2:39:43.741 --> 2:39:46.326
Which still bear the memory
of our breath?

2:39:46.494 --> 2:39:48.578
What for?

2:39:48.663 --> 2:39:51.289
In the hope that she’ll return?

2:39:51.624 --> 2:39:54.626
But I don't harbor this hope.

2:39:55.962 --> 2:39:58.004
The only thing left for me

2:39:58.172 --> 2:40:00.882
is to wait.

2:40:02.009 --> 2:40:05.929
I don't know what for.
New miracles?

2:40:12.103 --> 2:40:13.853
Are you tired?

2:40:14.313 --> 2:40:17.649
No, I feel great.

2:40:17.733 --> 2:40:19.484
You know, Kris...

2:40:19.610 --> 2:40:22.654
I think it's time
you returned to Earth.

2:40:24.323 --> 2:40:26.449
You think so?

2:46:45.663 --> 2:46:52.418
TΗE END
