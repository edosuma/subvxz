00:10.269 --> 00:14.449
Our blood is on your hands!
Climate change is not a lie!

00:14.473 --> 00:18.119
Do not let our people die!
Our blood is on your hands!

00:18.143 --> 00:21.923
Climate change is not a lie!
Do not let our people die!

00:21.947 --> 00:23.525
Our blood is on your hands!

00:23.549 --> 00:27.228
Climate change is not a lie!
Do not let our people die!

00:27.252 --> 00:28.830
Our blood is on your hands!

00:28.854 --> 00:32.467
Climate change is not a lie!
Do not let our people die!

00:32.491 --> 00:34.502
Our blood is on your hands!

00:37.309 --> 00:38.875
Hey, you wanted to see me?

00:39.303 --> 00:41.111
Yeah, please.

00:45.117 --> 00:46.427
So I spoke to the ADIC,

00:46.451 --> 00:48.629
and he told me about your job offer.

00:48.653 --> 00:51.666
I support whatever decision you make.

00:51.690 --> 00:54.302
I hate to lose you,

00:54.326 --> 00:57.872
but I know it'd only be for a few months.

00:57.896 --> 01:00.063
Thank you. I appreciate that.

01:03.335 --> 01:04.601
I'm gonna turn it down.

01:06.138 --> 01:07.648
You know, I love the work that we do,

01:07.672 --> 01:09.439
and I've got a great partner.

01:11.243 --> 01:16.324
Listen, I know the ADIC well,
and if you turn him down once,

01:16.348 --> 01:17.981
he won't ask again.

01:21.386 --> 01:25.466
That... so you're saying
I don't really have a choice.

01:25.490 --> 01:28.002
I know how these things work,
and I want to make sure

01:28.026 --> 01:30.782
you have all the facts
before you make your decision.

01:44.776 --> 01:45.920
Thank you, everyone,

01:45.944 --> 01:48.189
for coming out and braving the cold.

01:48.213 --> 01:51.496
I think those government suits
really heard us loud and clear.

01:51.520 --> 01:53.361
I still need a couple volunteers

01:53.385 --> 01:56.030
for next week's protest in Times Square.

01:56.054 --> 01:58.822
If you're interested, just hit me up.

02:00.145 --> 02:01.478
It was great. Thank you, thank you.

02:07.866 --> 02:09.877
A toothbrush and some shaving cream

02:09.901 --> 02:12.747
- will get that right out.
- Oh, thanks, Pete.

02:12.771 --> 02:14.182
Count me in for Times Square.

02:14.206 --> 02:15.590
Are you sure?

02:15.614 --> 02:17.385
There is a really good chance
we'll all get arrested.

02:17.409 --> 02:18.920
If Jane Fonda can spend

02:18.944 --> 02:20.810
a night in the slammer, so can I.

02:23.882 --> 02:26.160
Do you wanna get a drink?

02:26.546 --> 02:30.886
I would, but I just got
out of this relationship...

02:30.910 --> 02:34.001
No, that's okay.
Maybe next week we could...

02:45.737 --> 02:49.380
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

02:51.109 --> 02:52.420
Thank you.

02:54.946 --> 02:57.703
- Thank you.
- Mmm.

02:58.316 --> 03:01.730
Um, why does it smell like feet?

03:03.239 --> 03:04.716
It's the white truffles.

03:04.740 --> 03:06.251
They're flown in directly from Piedmont.

03:06.275 --> 03:08.542
You can only get them
a few months out of the year.

03:09.578 --> 03:13.324
Oh, come on, don't tell me
you've never had a truffle.

03:13.549 --> 03:15.661
I think we've established that we grew up

03:15.685 --> 03:17.429
under very different circumstances, Mona.

03:17.453 --> 03:20.198
Try it. They're a delicacy.

03:23.426 --> 03:24.503
They taste like feet too.

03:26.061 --> 03:27.995
I'm joking. It's good.

03:29.999 --> 03:31.710
But... Mm?

03:31.734 --> 03:33.345
How's your case going?

03:33.369 --> 03:36.481
So far so good.
Closing arguments are tomorrow.

03:41.677 --> 03:42.754
Work?

03:42.778 --> 03:44.812
Yeah, it's urgent.

03:46.582 --> 03:49.461
Sorry, uh, next dinner's on me?

03:54.423 --> 03:55.436
I'm sorry.

04:03.566 --> 04:05.339
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:05.363 --> 04:07.412
- Where's Maggie?
- Jules said she had a meeting.

04:07.436 --> 04:09.414
Okay, how many casualties we looking at?

04:09.438 --> 04:12.517
Don't know yet. FPS and
NYPD were first on scene.

04:12.541 --> 04:15.587
Detective Howard,
Special Agents Ryder and Zidan.

04:15.611 --> 04:16.721
What are we looking at?

04:16.745 --> 04:18.390
One dead, one wounded.

04:18.414 --> 04:20.158
Both members of a climate change group

04:20.182 --> 04:23.128
protesting outside
the EPA's New York offices.

04:23.152 --> 04:26.398
Deceased is Nicole Mitchell,
33-year-old art gallery owner

04:26.422 --> 04:28.800
from Brooklyn...
took three shots to the back.

04:28.824 --> 04:30.836
Over a hundred protesters gathered...

04:30.860 --> 04:32.671
lucky more people weren't shot.

04:32.695 --> 04:34.072
How many shots were fired?

04:34.096 --> 04:35.440
Conflicting reports... could be three,

04:35.464 --> 04:36.975
could be as many as ten.

04:36.999 --> 04:38.276
Anybody get a look at the shooter?

04:38.300 --> 04:39.344
It was dark.

04:39.368 --> 04:41.146
Appears he shot from inside a vehicle.

04:41.170 --> 04:42.280
Handful of witnesses say

04:42.304 --> 04:44.416
they saw a dark-colored sedan
speeding away.

04:44.440 --> 04:46.385
We're gonna check
for surveillance videos.

04:46.409 --> 04:47.719
Are we thinking that this was political?

04:47.743 --> 04:49.554
That the protesters were targeted?

04:49.578 --> 04:51.223
Seems that way.

04:51.247 --> 04:52.724
Is the organizer of the protest here?

04:52.748 --> 04:53.825
Maybe he knows something.

04:53.849 --> 04:56.728
Pete Bradford... he's our other victim.

04:56.752 --> 04:59.464
EMTs are prepping him for transport now.

04:59.488 --> 05:00.532
Okay, thank you.

05:00.556 --> 05:01.933
All right, y'all, come on in!

05:01.957 --> 05:04.002
Sorry you had to cancel
your evening plans.

05:04.026 --> 05:07.639
So our unknown suspect
shot two people in a protest

05:07.663 --> 05:09.408
just around the corner
from this building,

05:09.432 --> 05:12.210
and the burning question is,
was this attack motivated

05:12.234 --> 05:13.512
by political ideology?

05:13.536 --> 05:14.980
Mary, you wanna check the chatter?

05:15.004 --> 05:16.314
See if any climate change deniers

05:16.338 --> 05:18.283
are claiming credit for this online.

05:18.307 --> 05:20.018
Kris, you and your team wanna
look into the two victims...

05:20.042 --> 05:21.286
their jobs, their personal lives?

05:21.310 --> 05:22.354
Yeah.

05:22.378 --> 05:23.722
And someone check the shot spotter.

05:23.746 --> 05:25.123
See if we can't nail down
how many shots were fired.

05:25.147 --> 05:26.589
- I got it.
- Yes, sir.

05:26.613 --> 05:27.742
- Hey.
- Yeah?

05:27.766 --> 05:29.227
The UN is hosting a climate change summit

05:29.251 --> 05:30.429
- next month.
- Ah.

05:30.453 --> 05:32.063
This kind of attack
is not gonna play well.

05:32.087 --> 05:33.732
Did we get anything
from the surveillance footage?

05:33.756 --> 05:35.667
Yeah... Kelly, where are we
on the shooter's car?

05:35.691 --> 05:38.603
I can't get a clean angle on the plate.

05:38.627 --> 05:41.573
I can confirm that he's driving
a gray Honda Accord

05:41.597 --> 05:43.241
with a gold bumper.

05:43.265 --> 05:45.710
All right, gray Honda Accord,
gold bumper.

05:45.734 --> 05:48.146
Let's put out a BOLO.
Start pulling traffic stops.

05:48.170 --> 05:49.714
See if we can't find someone
who spotted a vehicle

05:49.738 --> 05:51.155
matching that description.

05:52.608 --> 05:53.970
Look, I didn't see much.

05:53.994 --> 05:56.288
When I felt the bullet hit my leg,

05:56.312 --> 05:58.790
my survival instinct kicked in, and I...

05:58.814 --> 06:01.092
just played dead
until I knew he was gone.

06:01.116 --> 06:03.094
We know this is hard, Mr. Bradford,

06:03.118 --> 06:05.263
but can you tell us,
has anyone been threatening your group?

06:05.287 --> 06:08.700
You kidding? My inbox
is flooded with tons

06:08.724 --> 06:11.269
of vicious attacks from internet trolls.

06:11.293 --> 06:12.671
What kind of attacks?

06:12.695 --> 06:15.507
They say that we're an arm
of the Islamic State.

06:15.531 --> 06:18.568
They say that we're being paid
to spread liberal lies.

06:18.592 --> 06:20.075
Have you told the cops any of this?

06:20.099 --> 06:21.948
No, I wish I had.

06:22.738 --> 06:25.183
I never thought someone
would do something like this.

06:25.207 --> 06:27.219
Okay, we need access to those emails.

06:27.243 --> 06:29.748
And if you think
of anything else, let us know.

06:33.115 --> 06:34.759
Hey, look who decided to join us.

06:34.783 --> 06:36.228
I had a work thing.

06:36.534 --> 06:38.812
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, fine.

06:41.539 --> 06:42.983
Kristen, you have all of us.

06:43.007 --> 06:44.851
Okay, so we checked the shot spotter.

06:44.875 --> 06:47.587
First gunshot was recorded at 7:53 p.m.

06:47.611 --> 06:49.689
followed by two more in rapid succession.

06:49.713 --> 06:51.491
But we know that Nicole Mitchell

06:51.515 --> 06:52.859
took three rounds and Pete took one,

06:52.883 --> 06:55.695
so shouldn't there have been
at least four gunshots?

06:55.719 --> 06:57.364
Well, M.E. just brought me up to speed...

06:57.388 --> 06:58.732
said that one of the bullets
that hit Nicole

06:58.756 --> 07:00.600
actually exited her body and struck Pete.

07:00.624 --> 07:01.735
That doesn't make any sense.

07:01.759 --> 07:03.670
If the shooter came here
to mow down protestors,

07:03.694 --> 07:05.405
then why would he stop at three shots?

07:08.933 --> 07:11.678
'Cause she was the only one
he was aiming for.

07:11.702 --> 07:14.214
Okay, so it appears
Nicole Mitchell was targeted

07:14.238 --> 07:16.716
by our shooter,
and the question is, why her?

07:16.740 --> 07:17.884
So what do we know about her life?

07:17.908 --> 07:19.286
Well, her dad's a Wall Street guy...

07:19.310 --> 07:21.421
Arthur Mitchell.
He manages Mitchell Financial.

07:21.445 --> 07:23.390
Arthur Mitchell... does that
name sound familiar to me?

07:23.414 --> 07:25.559
He's a major donor
to the Republican party...

07:25.583 --> 07:27.327
famously bought a local election

07:27.351 --> 07:29.396
just so he could build
a gun range in his backyard.

07:29.420 --> 07:30.864
So her dad has his own enemies.

07:30.888 --> 07:33.466
Let's assemble a list. What
else do we know about Nicole?

07:33.490 --> 07:34.968
Well, she graduated with honors

07:34.992 --> 07:36.261
from Columbia Law School,

07:36.285 --> 07:37.604
followed that up with a short stint

07:37.628 --> 07:39.005
at the Federal Public Defender's office,

07:39.029 --> 07:40.707
and then devoted her time and money

07:40.731 --> 07:42.509
to various progressive causes,
any one of which

07:42.533 --> 07:43.677
could have made her a target.

07:43.701 --> 07:46.446
All right, well, let's do a
deep dive into Nicole's life...

07:46.470 --> 07:47.948
any recent issues, conflicts,

07:47.972 --> 07:49.950
and let's get Emily and Scola
over to her dad's place.

07:53.410 --> 07:54.754
I don't have to guess who did this.

07:54.778 --> 07:57.679
I know who did this.
His name is Todd Conroy.

07:58.682 --> 08:00.360
That an employee of yours?

08:00.384 --> 08:02.395
Nicole's ex.

08:02.419 --> 08:05.899
They met six months ago
through a mutual friend.

08:05.923 --> 08:08.668
Things seemed to be going well.

08:08.692 --> 08:10.270
They were even planning a trip to Ibiza,

08:10.294 --> 08:13.106
and then, a week ago, Nicole ended it.

08:13.130 --> 08:14.674
Any idea why?

08:15.186 --> 08:18.445
My daughter hasn't shared
the intimate details

08:18.469 --> 08:20.413
of her love life with me since
she had a crush

08:20.437 --> 08:22.849
on Tommy Jenkins in the fifth grade.

08:22.873 --> 08:25.518
But she told you Conroy
didn't take the break-up well?

08:25.542 --> 08:27.954
Conroy was showing up
at her loft at all hours,

08:27.978 --> 08:30.290
sending her threatening text messages.

08:30.314 --> 08:31.725
My lawyers were in the process of getting

08:31.749 --> 08:33.460
an order of protection against him.

08:33.484 --> 08:35.851
And you believe Conroy's
capable of something like this?

08:37.860 --> 08:40.273
There were very few things
that scared her.

08:40.297 --> 08:42.130
Todd Conroy was one of them.

08:43.866 --> 08:47.540
If only I had done something more.

08:49.582 --> 08:52.516
You can't blame yourself, Mr. Mitchell.

08:54.666 --> 08:57.045
I'm not a good person, Agent Scola.

08:57.070 --> 09:00.015
I've known that for a long time.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.473
But Nicole...

09:03.262 --> 09:05.407
She was good.

09:05.631 --> 09:08.510
She was the only good thing
I've ever done.

09:10.722 --> 09:12.599
According to the victim's father,

09:12.623 --> 09:14.668
Nicole was being stalked
by an ex-boyfriend.

09:14.692 --> 09:17.237
Todd Conroy... local nightclub promoter

09:17.261 --> 09:19.373
with a profitable side hustle
dealing club drugs...

09:19.397 --> 09:21.809
Molly, cocaine, GHB, you name it.

09:21.833 --> 09:23.243
Guy's a regular candy store.

09:23.267 --> 09:25.746
Okay, so Conroy's on probation.

09:25.770 --> 09:28.115
Did six months for possession
with intent to distribute

09:28.139 --> 09:29.917
and was picked up two years ago

09:29.941 --> 09:31.785
for an unspecified domestic disturbance.

09:31.809 --> 09:34.054
His then-girlfriend
declined to press charges.

09:34.078 --> 09:35.289
Sounds like a real winner.

09:35.313 --> 09:37.257
So how did a bleeding heart like Nicole

09:37.281 --> 09:39.626
hook up with a scumbag like him?

09:39.650 --> 09:41.478
Guys like Conroy know how to blend in.

09:41.502 --> 09:42.638
Emily's right.

09:42.662 --> 09:44.150
I've going through Nicole's phone,

09:44.174 --> 09:45.999
and last week, she texted Conroy

09:46.023 --> 09:48.535
and accused him of using her
to get access to her friends.

09:48.559 --> 09:51.972
So he charms her with his
good looks and rich kid veneer,

09:51.996 --> 09:53.474
and then he sells designer drugs

09:53.498 --> 09:55.209
to her deep-pocketed friends.

09:55.233 --> 09:57.111
Mm-hmm, next day,
she texted everyone she knew,

09:57.135 --> 09:59.113
told them Conroy was a poser, a dealer,

09:59.137 --> 10:01.582
and that's when things got really nasty.

10:01.606 --> 10:04.618
Conroy started sending dozens
of angry text messages,

10:04.642 --> 10:07.121
including this one,
a few hours before the attack.

10:07.145 --> 10:09.423
Notice the last one: "I'll end you."

10:09.447 --> 10:10.633
That's not all.

10:10.657 --> 10:12.826
Conroy's phone pinged off
a tower, Lower Manhattan,

10:12.850 --> 10:14.283
8:30 p.m. last night.

10:16.371 --> 10:17.431
Bring him in.

10:25.296 --> 10:26.860
Hey, Scola.

10:27.498 --> 10:29.131
Is that him?

10:31.569 --> 10:32.646
I got it.

10:35.673 --> 10:38.786
Conroy, stop!

10:43.848 --> 10:45.626
Gun!

10:47.518 --> 10:49.463
Conroy, stop!

10:56.928 --> 10:58.872
Going somewhere?

11:07.939 --> 11:10.028
Fished that out of the river.

11:10.441 --> 11:11.685
It's not mine.

11:11.709 --> 11:13.821
That gun fires .40 caliber rounds...

11:13.845 --> 11:15.456
same as the slugs they pulled

11:15.480 --> 11:17.024
from your ex-girlfriend, Nicole.

11:17.048 --> 11:18.514
Nicole was shot?

11:19.550 --> 11:21.328
Don't act like you didn't know.

11:21.352 --> 11:23.063
I... I didn't. I swear.

11:23.087 --> 11:24.364
We know you threatened Nicole

11:24.388 --> 11:26.400
after she outed you to her friends.

11:26.424 --> 11:27.921
We found these.

11:28.459 --> 11:30.103
"Rot in hell."

11:30.507 --> 11:33.540
And my favorite: "I'll end you."

11:33.564 --> 11:35.409
You sent that last one a couple hours

11:35.433 --> 11:36.832
before Nicole was gunned down.

11:39.604 --> 11:41.715
They're just words.

11:41.739 --> 11:43.517
I... I didn't really mean it.

11:43.541 --> 11:46.854
I never would have actually hurt her.

11:46.878 --> 11:49.056
We can place you in Lower Manhattan

11:49.080 --> 11:50.913
around the time of Nicole's murder.

11:52.917 --> 11:55.229
I was making deliveries.

11:55.253 --> 11:56.763
Some of those Wall Street guys like to go

11:56.787 --> 11:58.599
straight from work to the club.

11:58.623 --> 12:00.000
Don't suppose any of your customers

12:00.024 --> 12:01.590
would be willing to confirm that?

12:03.127 --> 12:05.439
Admit it, Conroy, you were pissed.

12:05.463 --> 12:08.342
You spent months using Nicole
to cultivate new clients.

12:08.366 --> 12:11.545
She killed your access,
so you killed her.

12:11.569 --> 12:13.080
I was upset.

12:13.104 --> 12:17.172
She embarrassed me, but I had
nothing to do with her murder.

12:18.576 --> 12:20.209
Then what was the gun for?

12:25.182 --> 12:27.094
Protection.

12:27.118 --> 12:31.131
I got robbed by a supplier
a few months ago.

12:31.155 --> 12:35.936
That's why I ran.
I had no idea Nicole was dead.

12:43.134 --> 12:44.533
Sit tight.

12:49.974 --> 12:52.185
Hey, ballistics came back
on Conroy's gun.

12:52.209 --> 12:53.954
It's not the murder weapon, plus...

12:53.978 --> 12:55.889
The doorman's got Conroy
leaving his building

12:55.913 --> 12:57.491
last night at 7:40.

12:57.515 --> 12:59.326
There's no way he could have
made it from his apartment

12:59.350 --> 13:02.462
in Long Island City
to Foley Square in 13 minutes.

13:02.486 --> 13:06.366
Guys, I just ran
the ballistics through NIBIN.

13:06.390 --> 13:08.268
Rifling on the bullet
they pulled from Nicole

13:08.292 --> 13:11.038
matches another bullet NYPD
recovered from a shooting

13:11.062 --> 13:13.140
in the Bronx yesterday morning.

13:13.164 --> 13:15.542
So we've got two victims
shot by the same killer

13:15.566 --> 13:17.444
on the same day.

13:17.468 --> 13:19.112
Our shooter's on a killing spree.

13:23.139 --> 13:24.516
So our shooter has killed two people

13:24.540 --> 13:26.385
in a 24-hour period.

13:26.409 --> 13:28.627
Now, it's entirely possible
he's hiding out...

13:28.652 --> 13:30.738
that he's done whatever he set out to do.

13:30.762 --> 13:33.040
But we have to assume
that he is still out there

13:33.064 --> 13:34.675
- searching for his next victim.
- Yes, yes.

13:34.699 --> 13:36.343
Our first priority is to catch this guy

13:36.367 --> 13:38.078
before another body drops.

13:38.445 --> 13:41.257
Let's start by figuring out
how he's choosing his victims.

13:41.281 --> 13:42.492
And does he have an agenda,

13:42.516 --> 13:44.694
or is he targeting people at random?

13:44.718 --> 13:47.130
Now, our second victim is Leo Ramirez,

13:47.154 --> 13:49.032
the leader of the Los Caballeros,

13:49.056 --> 13:50.934
the violent Dominican street gang.

13:50.958 --> 13:52.602
Ramirez was shot in East Concourse

13:52.626 --> 13:54.687
at 8:20 a.m. yesterday morning.

13:54.711 --> 13:56.072
A witness told detectives

13:56.096 --> 13:57.507
that the shooter was African-American

13:57.531 --> 13:59.142
but couldn't give a description.

13:59.166 --> 14:01.544
PD's been shaking down
the usual suspects.

14:01.568 --> 14:02.879
So far, no leads.

14:02.903 --> 14:05.648
What do Mitchell and Ramirez
have in common?

14:05.672 --> 14:07.250
What's the connection between the two?

14:07.274 --> 14:09.552
Zero contact over phone or social media.

14:09.576 --> 14:11.721
No friends or followers in common.

14:11.745 --> 14:13.790
There's absolutely nothing to
suggest they've ever met before.

14:13.814 --> 14:16.702
Los Caballeros is a major
player in the cocaine trade.

14:16.726 --> 14:19.442
Could be overlap with Nicole's
drug-dealing ex-boyfriend.

14:19.466 --> 14:21.598
Explore that... find out
if Ramirez or his gang

14:21.622 --> 14:23.633
ever crossed paths with Todd Conroy.

14:23.657 --> 14:26.770
And what about Nicole's time
as a public defender?

14:26.794 --> 14:28.138
Was Ramirez ever a client?

14:28.162 --> 14:29.639
No, I checked the court records.

14:29.663 --> 14:32.142
I also spoke to her supervisor
who said she wasn't aware

14:32.166 --> 14:33.443
of any threats made against Nicole

14:33.467 --> 14:35.297
during her time at the defender's office.

14:35.321 --> 14:37.447
Well, keep digging, and someone reach out

14:37.471 --> 14:39.783
to the homicide detectives
working the Ramirez case.

14:41.979 --> 14:44.554
Ramirez took four rounds
to the chest at close range.

14:44.578 --> 14:46.656
Bled out before the ambulance got here.

14:46.680 --> 14:48.658
Witness was in her apartment at the time.

14:48.682 --> 14:50.226
She saw the suspect approach Ramirez,

14:50.250 --> 14:52.595
the two exchange words, then the suspect

14:52.619 --> 14:54.297
shot Ramirez and took off in his car.

14:54.321 --> 14:55.598
Did she hear what they said?

14:55.622 --> 14:58.134
Nah, she was too far away
to really make it out...

14:58.158 --> 14:59.624
something about wanting a name.

15:00.961 --> 15:02.972
Word on the street
is the shooter was a Blood.

15:02.996 --> 15:04.841
They've been battling
for control of this area.

15:04.865 --> 15:06.443
But you don't agree?

15:06.467 --> 15:08.511
Gang unit's got a guy
in deep with the Bloods.

15:08.535 --> 15:10.046
Says even they were surprised by this.

15:10.070 --> 15:11.347
Are you thinking an inside job?

15:11.371 --> 15:13.216
Ramirez was head of Los Caballeros

15:13.240 --> 15:14.784
for the better part of a decade.

15:14.808 --> 15:16.786
He's got enemies from here
to Santo Domingo,

15:16.810 --> 15:18.488
and I'm not just talking
about other gangs.

15:18.512 --> 15:20.123
A lot of people in this community

15:20.147 --> 15:21.958
lost their kids to gang violence.

15:21.982 --> 15:24.461
These security cameras
catch the shooting?

15:24.485 --> 15:26.751
No, none of them were aimed this way.

15:32.559 --> 15:33.658
Thanks.

15:41.535 --> 15:42.679
Bus was scheduled to be here

15:42.703 --> 15:44.647
around the time of the shooting.

15:44.671 --> 15:46.316
Maybe the dash cam caught something.

15:50.978 --> 15:52.922
There... car goes by

15:52.946 --> 15:54.824
two minutes before the shooting.

15:54.848 --> 15:57.994
- Can you get a plate?
- Yep, running it now.

16:00.554 --> 16:03.566
Okay, looks like he stole
the tags off a Ford Fusion.

16:03.590 --> 16:05.034
All right, run it through the DAS.

16:05.058 --> 16:07.158
See if it's been picked up
by any license plate readers.

16:08.829 --> 16:12.008
Got a hit. It's been scanned
by a patrol car 20 minutes ago

16:12.032 --> 16:13.543
on Broadway and Clinton heading west.

16:13.567 --> 16:15.033
Great, call Maggie and OA.

16:18.405 --> 16:19.704
It's over there.

16:37.357 --> 16:39.102
Still warm. Couldn't have gotten far.

16:39.126 --> 16:40.425
Unless he boosted another car.

16:42.496 --> 16:43.673
No surveillance cams.

16:43.697 --> 16:44.874
Hey, can you sweep the neighborhood?

16:44.898 --> 16:46.442
Keep an eye out for any stolen cars,

16:46.466 --> 16:47.960
anyone that looks suspicious.

16:47.984 --> 16:49.746
Trunk's open.

17:01.181 --> 17:03.381
So, you gonna tell me
what's been bothering you?

17:05.319 --> 17:08.097
- Nothing.
- So you've been saying.

17:08.121 --> 17:09.464
Come on, Maggie, I'm your partner.

17:09.489 --> 17:11.289
You've been off ever since you
had that meeting last night.

17:15.194 --> 17:17.561
The Assistant Director
in Charge asked to see me.

17:18.031 --> 17:20.009
What'd he want?

17:20.032 --> 17:22.267
He has an assignment... undercover deal.

17:24.637 --> 17:25.781
He didn't give me all the details,

17:25.806 --> 17:27.684
but he said it's a pretty big case.

17:27.708 --> 17:29.574
Guess I fit the profile
they're looking for.

17:30.877 --> 17:32.743
He said it could be good for my career.

17:33.246 --> 17:34.958
What'd you tell him?

17:34.982 --> 17:37.293
- Said I'd think about it.
- And?

17:37.317 --> 17:38.761
Just seems like
the more I think about it,

17:38.785 --> 17:40.452
the harder the decision is to make.

17:50.130 --> 17:51.162
Hey, OA.

17:54.668 --> 17:55.845
What is it?

17:55.869 --> 17:58.081
It's a docket number
to a district court case.

17:58.105 --> 18:00.683
Look, TM... Thurgood Marshall courthouse.

18:00.707 --> 18:02.018
That's only a few blocks away from here.

18:02.042 --> 18:04.354
What if the shooter's going after
someone involved in the case?

18:04.378 --> 18:07.490
Well, it's 2:45,
so that means we only have 15 minutes.

18:07.514 --> 18:08.658
Okay, let me see this.

18:19.860 --> 18:22.572
According to court records,

18:22.596 --> 18:24.907
the case is United States
vs. Anatoly Adurov.

18:26.466 --> 18:28.311
That's Mona's case. She's the prosecutor.

18:28.335 --> 18:29.367
Okay.

18:30.771 --> 18:32.982
She's still not answering.

18:37.389 --> 18:39.678
There, OA, it's Mona.

18:44.785 --> 18:46.362
- Gun!
- Mona!

18:49.823 --> 18:51.167
- Take the shot!
- I can't!

18:51.191 --> 18:52.201
There's too many civilians.

18:52.225 --> 18:54.103
Maggie, stay with her.

19:17.461 --> 19:20.440
PD's canvassing the area,
but so far, no sign of him.

19:20.464 --> 19:22.475
There's a good chance
he made it onto the subway.

19:22.499 --> 19:24.244
Well, that means he could be
anywhere in the city right now.

19:24.268 --> 19:25.912
Tell me we at least
got his face on camera.

19:25.936 --> 19:27.414
Not enough for facial rec.

19:27.438 --> 19:29.749
You think you can give a
description to a sketch artist?

19:29.773 --> 19:30.984
No, I didn't get
a good enough look at him.

19:31.008 --> 19:33.887
I don't think it's broken,
but you'll need an X-ray to be sure.

19:33.911 --> 19:35.922
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

19:35.946 --> 19:37.057
You okay?

19:37.081 --> 19:38.458
I am thanks to you and Maggie.

19:38.482 --> 19:40.927
- Are you sure?
- I'm fine.

19:40.951 --> 19:43.263
What is going on, Omar?

19:43.287 --> 19:45.966
Do you remember a lawyer
named Nicole Mitchell?

19:45.990 --> 19:49.235
Yeah, we tried a few cases
against one another.

19:49.259 --> 19:53.139
Okay, well, she was killed
at a protest here last night.

19:53.163 --> 19:55.175
Whoever killed Nicole
also killed a gangbanger,

19:55.199 --> 19:56.343
Leo Ramirez.

19:56.367 --> 19:59.279
Wait, are you saying the same person

19:59.303 --> 20:01.114
just tried to kill me?

20:01.138 --> 20:03.016
Well, the shooter has a hit list,

20:03.040 --> 20:05.104
and it looks like you're on it.

20:05.709 --> 20:07.053
Can you think of any reason

20:07.077 --> 20:09.155
someone would want to target
the three of you?

20:09.179 --> 20:10.824
And did you know Ramirez?

20:10.848 --> 20:12.459
I did.

20:16.687 --> 20:18.965
I had a murder trial a while back.

20:18.989 --> 20:21.234
It was a hit on a senior member
of the Crips.

20:21.258 --> 20:23.336
Gang unit was sure Ramirez
had ordered it,

20:23.360 --> 20:24.671
but the only guy who was charged

20:24.695 --> 20:27.841
was a 16-year-old kid
driving the getaway car.

20:27.865 --> 20:30.499
And Nicole... she represented him?

20:32.469 --> 20:34.781
He was a local basketball star.

20:34.805 --> 20:36.349
Cops caught him fleeing the scene.

20:36.373 --> 20:38.218
Shooter wasn't in the car.

20:38.242 --> 20:40.186
I did everything I could
to persuade the kid

20:40.210 --> 20:41.888
to give him up, but he wouldn't talk.

20:41.912 --> 20:43.559
So what happened to the kid?

20:43.914 --> 20:45.125
My boss wanted to send a message.

20:45.149 --> 20:46.693
He pushed me to try him as an adult.

20:46.717 --> 20:47.894
Nicole got scared.

20:47.918 --> 20:49.396
She knew that if her case went to trial,

20:49.420 --> 20:51.031
her client could end up doing life,

20:51.055 --> 20:53.033
so she convinced him to take a deal...

20:53.057 --> 20:54.868
conspiracy, four years.

20:54.892 --> 20:56.358
Okay, what's the kid's name?

20:57.861 --> 20:59.728
Alex Bryant.

21:00.864 --> 21:02.409
Okay, people, we have a suspect,

21:02.433 --> 21:04.310
and his name is Alex Bryant.

21:04.334 --> 21:06.079
Bryant spent the last
four years in Otisville.

21:06.103 --> 21:08.081
He was released two weeks ago,
and the question is,

21:08.105 --> 21:10.050
did Bryant get out of prison
with a hit list?

21:10.074 --> 21:11.918
Is he looking to get revenge
on the people

21:11.942 --> 21:14.754
that put him inside?
So let's dig into this kid.

21:14.778 --> 21:16.089
Can we place him
at any of the crime scenes?

21:16.113 --> 21:18.258
No, his cell's been turned
off for the last two days.

21:18.282 --> 21:20.693
All right, let's update the
BOLO to include his mug shot,

21:20.717 --> 21:22.028
and tell PD to approach with caution.

21:22.052 --> 21:23.196
Hey, let's make a list of all the people

21:23.220 --> 21:24.364
involved in Bryant's case.

21:24.388 --> 21:25.565
I want everyone put under protection

21:25.589 --> 21:27.100
until we have him in custody.

21:27.124 --> 21:28.468
We figured out
where Bryant's been living?

21:28.492 --> 21:30.003
Yes, his probation officer
says he's living

21:30.027 --> 21:31.237
with his dad in Morris Heights.

21:31.261 --> 21:32.972
Oh, great... text Maggie and OA
the address.

21:38.168 --> 21:40.480
Alex hasn't been home
since early yesterday.

21:40.504 --> 21:43.616
He and his dad got into it. He took off.

21:43.640 --> 21:45.285
What were they fighting about?

21:45.309 --> 21:47.620
Don't know. I was in the shower.

21:47.644 --> 21:49.889
But Alex hasn't been the same
since he got out.

21:49.913 --> 21:51.891
Used to be such a happy kid.

21:51.915 --> 21:53.949
Now he's just angry all the time.

21:55.219 --> 21:56.852
Can I ask what this is about?

21:58.188 --> 21:59.666
Yeah, we need to speak
with him over an incident

21:59.690 --> 22:01.000
that happened yesterday morning.

22:01.024 --> 22:03.103
Do you have any idea
where he may have gone?

22:03.127 --> 22:05.371
Probably crashed at his friend Benny's.

22:05.395 --> 22:07.607
Benny's the only one
Alex stayed tight with

22:07.631 --> 22:08.952
after he went away.

22:08.976 --> 22:11.544
I know they hung out
a couple of nights ago.

22:11.568 --> 22:13.446
Does Alex have access to any guns?

22:13.470 --> 22:14.848
We don't own any weapons...

22:14.872 --> 22:17.072
Selina, don't say another word.

22:20.177 --> 22:21.855
Mr. Bryant,
I'm Special Agent Maggie Bell.

22:21.879 --> 22:23.857
This is my partner, OA Zidan.

22:23.881 --> 22:26.426
We're looking for your son, Alex.

22:26.450 --> 22:27.927
What are you accusing him of now?

22:27.951 --> 22:29.329
We would just like to talk to him.

22:29.353 --> 22:31.464
Yeah, same thing
the cops said four years ago.

22:31.488 --> 22:33.466
Do you know where he is? Yes or no?

22:33.490 --> 22:35.368
I wouldn't tell you even if I did,

22:35.392 --> 22:37.737
so unless you got a warrant,
you can get the hell up out of here.

22:37.761 --> 22:41.608
Well, Mr. Bryan, we think that your
son may be in some serious trouble.

22:41.632 --> 22:45.178
Let me tell you something.
My boy was a good kid.

22:45.202 --> 22:47.514
He had 15 scholarships, 15.

22:47.538 --> 22:49.916
Could've gone pro, but, like a dog,

22:49.940 --> 22:51.417
y'all lock him up in a cage, so please

22:51.441 --> 22:53.987
don't come up in here pretending
like you care about Alex.

22:54.011 --> 22:56.789
We do care about the families
of the people he has killed

22:56.813 --> 22:59.359
and the ones he is trying to kill.

22:59.383 --> 23:04.130
Please leave before I file a complaint.

23:18.268 --> 23:21.347
Hey, call Kristen. Get her
to look into that kid Benny.

23:21.371 --> 23:23.883
Stepmom said they were hanging
out the night before the shooting.

23:23.907 --> 23:25.685
Maybe he knows where Alex is.

23:30.347 --> 23:33.526
I haven't seen or heard
from Alex since that night.

23:33.550 --> 23:35.595
Did Alex seem upset about anything?

23:35.619 --> 23:37.163
Yeah, he was upset.

23:37.187 --> 23:39.399
Just found out
he'd never play college hoops.

23:39.423 --> 23:42.235
Surprise, surprise... all those
coaches kissing his ass

23:42.259 --> 23:44.470
before the arrest
won't even take his calls.

23:44.494 --> 23:46.306
And all over a trumped up charge?

23:46.330 --> 23:47.907
What do you mean "trumped up"?

23:47.931 --> 23:50.710
Everyone knew Alex
wasn't in a gang back then.

23:50.734 --> 23:53.379
He was a baller, man.
He didn't sell drugs.

23:53.403 --> 23:55.481
He told the cops he didn't know
the other guy in the car

23:55.505 --> 23:57.083
was gonna shoot someone.

23:57.107 --> 23:58.451
Thought they was just gonna get a burger.

23:58.475 --> 24:00.186
So Alex in some kind of trouble?

24:00.210 --> 24:01.854
Well, we think he may be
going after the people

24:01.878 --> 24:03.389
he blames for putting him in prison.

24:03.413 --> 24:04.657
Ramirez...

24:04.681 --> 24:06.259
You think Alex killed Ramirez?

24:06.283 --> 24:08.850
Not just Ramirez,
his public defender too.

24:15.525 --> 24:16.558
Benny...

24:18.295 --> 24:19.739
You gotta tell us what you know.

24:19.763 --> 24:21.527
I don't know anything.

24:22.266 --> 24:23.487
Still in that gang?

24:25.135 --> 24:27.113
Nah, I'm out that life.

24:27.137 --> 24:29.916
That's smart. Only two
ways that book ends, right?

24:29.940 --> 24:31.284
Prison or a grave.

24:31.308 --> 24:33.386
Now you're on the other side
working security.

24:33.410 --> 24:34.587
Get to carry a gun.

24:34.611 --> 24:36.289
Yeah, it makes us wonder.

24:36.313 --> 24:39.926
Mm-mm, maybe you
loaned Alex one of your guns.

24:39.950 --> 24:42.195
If you did, and if one
of your guns comes back

24:42.219 --> 24:44.097
connected to the murders
or the shootings,

24:44.121 --> 24:45.920
you will be tied up in this, Benny.

24:48.592 --> 24:51.204
That night, after Alex and I hung out,

24:51.228 --> 24:55.030
one of my guns got stolen...
the one I keep in my car.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.045
Maybe Alex took it when he left my place.

24:59.069 --> 25:00.913
What kind of gun was it?

25:00.937 --> 25:02.615
Glock 22.

25:02.639 --> 25:04.083
Same caliber as the murder weapon.

25:05.208 --> 25:06.241
We gotta go.

25:07.611 --> 25:09.922
If you hear from Alex, give us a call.

25:09.946 --> 25:11.824
NYPD blue and white
just said they spotted

25:11.848 --> 25:13.426
someone fitting Alex's description

25:13.450 --> 25:14.761
running into an abandoned warehouse

25:14.785 --> 25:17.930
half a mile from here.
SWAT's already on the way.

25:27.964 --> 25:29.178
FBI!

25:59.563 --> 26:01.196
Hey.

26:02.532 --> 26:03.998
This is a shooting gallery.

26:06.903 --> 26:09.804
FBI, show me your hands. Hey!

26:14.311 --> 26:15.877
It's Alex, OA.

26:19.015 --> 26:20.448
He's not breathing.

26:23.665 --> 26:24.997
We need a medic now.

26:30.994 --> 26:32.366
Come on, Alex.

26:36.724 --> 26:38.635
Alex, I'm Special Agent Maggie Bell.

26:38.659 --> 26:42.205
This is my partner OA Zidan.
We're with the FBI

26:42.229 --> 26:43.695
Like to ask you a couple questions.

26:45.332 --> 26:47.297
Can you tell us where you were
the last couple of days?

26:48.369 --> 26:50.647
- Around.
- Hm.

26:50.671 --> 26:52.971
Were you around lower Manhattan?

26:54.103 --> 26:55.185
No.

26:55.209 --> 26:56.686
Sure about that?

26:56.710 --> 26:58.422
'Cause we have a dead body
that says otherwise...

26:58.446 --> 27:00.345
your lawyer Nicole Mitchell.

27:01.415 --> 27:02.692
I don't know anything about that.

27:02.716 --> 27:04.231
Well, we think you do.

27:04.852 --> 27:07.397
We also think you know about
the murder of Leo Ramirez

27:07.754 --> 27:10.688
and the attempted murder
of a federal prosecutor.

27:13.494 --> 27:17.574
Okay, Alex, look, I get it.
You got screwed four years ago.

27:17.598 --> 27:19.543
You get into a car with a buddy,

27:19.567 --> 27:21.077
and suddenly, you're doing four years

27:21.101 --> 27:22.813
for conspiracy to commit a murder.

27:23.375 --> 27:25.704
You don't know
what you're talking about, man.

27:27.808 --> 27:29.715
I know you were headed to college

27:30.244 --> 27:32.022
on a basketball scholarship,

27:32.301 --> 27:34.090
but you ended up in prison instead

27:34.114 --> 27:36.054
as a 16-year-old kid.

27:36.717 --> 27:38.350
We read your prison file.

27:39.720 --> 27:41.264
We know what happened
to you on the inside.

27:43.891 --> 27:46.440
Alex, I can't imagine how
horrible that would have been.

27:46.894 --> 27:49.406
I was trying to do the right thing.

27:49.430 --> 27:51.508
We get that, and the judge will too,

27:51.532 --> 27:54.778
but you have to come clean
and tell us what happened.

27:54.802 --> 27:58.815
I didn't kill anyone, man.
I swear to God.

27:58.839 --> 28:00.650
We know about the gun.

28:00.674 --> 28:02.085
We know you stole it from Benny,

28:02.109 --> 28:03.609
so what did you do with it?

28:05.446 --> 28:07.290
Somebody took it from me.

28:07.314 --> 28:08.629
Who?

28:08.949 --> 28:10.382
I don't know.

28:11.631 --> 28:14.564
Okay, Alex, we wanna help you,
but we can't do that

28:14.588 --> 28:15.765
unless you help us first.

28:15.789 --> 28:17.767
I said I don't know, all right?

28:17.791 --> 28:19.736
You wanna put me back in prison?

28:23.297 --> 28:24.363
Go ahead.

28:35.543 --> 28:37.354
Alex Bryant is not talking.

28:37.378 --> 28:38.955
We need to prove this is our guy,

28:38.979 --> 28:41.892
but right now, we can't place
him at any of the shootings.

28:41.916 --> 28:43.760
There's no murder weapon.

28:43.784 --> 28:46.596
All we have is this
theoretical revenge motive,

28:46.620 --> 28:50.656
which is not enough to indict
let alone convict.

28:52.159 --> 28:53.503
Come on, Kelly.

28:53.527 --> 28:55.071
You guys keep digging
through that video footage.

28:55.095 --> 28:57.774
I'll buy you each a candy bar
if you find this guy on camera.

28:57.798 --> 28:59.676
Hey, ERT find anything in the car?

28:59.700 --> 29:01.111
No useable prints or DNA.

29:01.135 --> 29:04.347
He's a junkie. I'm not buying
he didn't slip up, people.

29:04.371 --> 29:06.349
Hospital sent over Alex's clothes.

29:06.373 --> 29:07.984
Tell me there's GSR.

29:08.008 --> 29:10.453
No, but there was a ticket
from a pawn shop in his pocket.

29:10.477 --> 29:12.088
It didn't say what was pawned,
but the shop

29:12.112 --> 29:14.157
has a previous firearms violation.

29:14.181 --> 29:15.692
Could be that he pawned
the murder weapon.

29:15.716 --> 29:17.727
Yeah, great, take Emily, check it out.

29:17.751 --> 29:19.329
I'll go check in with Mona,
see if she remembers

29:19.353 --> 29:20.297
anything else about Alex's case.

29:20.321 --> 29:21.353
Yep.

29:25.059 --> 29:26.036
Doctors say it's just a bad sprain.

29:26.060 --> 29:27.704
Oh, that's good.

29:27.728 --> 29:29.706
- I heard you arrested Alex.
- I did.

29:29.730 --> 29:31.508
That's why I called.

29:31.532 --> 29:33.176
Just trying to wrap my brain
around a few things.

29:33.200 --> 29:35.512
I thought maybe you'd be able to help.

29:35.536 --> 29:37.009
Yeah, sure.

29:37.471 --> 29:38.815
So I read his file.

29:38.839 --> 29:40.817
Alex was driving the car,
but he told the police

29:40.841 --> 29:42.953
that he had no idea his unnamed friend

29:42.977 --> 29:45.989
was gonna shoot a gang member.

29:46.013 --> 29:47.490
Yeah, the old "I didn't know

29:47.514 --> 29:49.693
my criminal friend was about
to commit a crime" defense.

29:49.717 --> 29:51.481
And you didn't buy that?

29:52.119 --> 29:54.720
Show me your friends,
I'll show you your future.

29:57.257 --> 29:58.535
That's a little preachy.

29:58.559 --> 30:01.871
I mean, just because
Bryant's friend is a punk

30:01.895 --> 30:03.106
doesn't mean that he's a punk.

30:03.130 --> 30:04.995
Was there other evidence
that he was a bad kid?

30:05.666 --> 30:07.010
What are you getting at?

30:07.034 --> 30:08.467
It's just...

30:10.304 --> 30:11.918
If he was really guilty,

30:12.840 --> 30:14.651
he should be celebrating the fact

30:14.675 --> 30:17.087
that he only got four years,

30:17.111 --> 30:18.521
looking forward to new beginnings,

30:18.545 --> 30:20.223
not out killing people.

30:20.247 --> 30:22.258
Bryant knew what was about to go down.

30:22.282 --> 30:24.828
You don't just get
into a car with a gang member.

30:27.087 --> 30:28.421
I don't know about that.

30:28.445 --> 30:33.169
Mona, I mean,
where Bryant is from... where I'm from...

30:33.193 --> 30:35.105
you kind of do get into the car

30:35.129 --> 30:37.073
with drug dealers and gang members

30:37.097 --> 30:38.608
because those are the kids

30:38.632 --> 30:40.110
that you went to elementary school with,

30:40.134 --> 30:43.113
the kids that you play basketball with,

30:43.137 --> 30:46.116
so I'm not really sure
that I agree with your premise.

30:46.140 --> 30:48.718
Do I think it's possible
that Bryant had no idea

30:48.742 --> 30:50.954
what was going to happen
when he got into that car?

30:50.978 --> 30:52.389
Sure.

30:52.413 --> 30:54.157
But that doesn't make him innocent.

30:54.181 --> 30:57.182
I mean, he knew who the killer
was and didn't say anything.

30:59.853 --> 31:02.098
All right, I don't care
where you grow up.

31:02.122 --> 31:03.455
That's wrong.

31:06.293 --> 31:07.370
Tell me.

31:07.394 --> 31:09.406
Well, Alex didn't pawn a gun.

31:09.430 --> 31:11.608
He pawned a watch and some jewelry.

31:11.632 --> 31:13.143
Uh-huh. When was this?

31:13.167 --> 31:15.478
The same day our two victims were killed.

31:15.502 --> 31:16.846
I just found a police report

31:16.870 --> 31:18.581
of a mugging in the same vicinity

31:18.605 --> 31:20.984
as the pawn shop
a night before the shootings.

31:21.008 --> 31:22.819
A couple says an African-American male

31:22.843 --> 31:23.787
robbed them at gunpoint

31:23.811 --> 31:25.221
and made off with their valuables.

31:25.245 --> 31:28.078
Right, so maybe this was him
needing money for dope.

31:28.782 --> 31:29.903
- Guys?
- Yeah.

31:29.927 --> 31:31.594
I checked surveillance footage.

31:31.618 --> 31:32.796
Alex was at the pawn shop

31:32.820 --> 31:35.498
at the same time Ramirez was gunned down.

31:35.522 --> 31:37.467
There's no way Alex
could have killed him.

31:40.227 --> 31:42.939
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
it appears Alex Bryant

31:42.963 --> 31:44.607
has an alibi for Ramirez's killing,

31:44.631 --> 31:46.142
and, since we know the same shooter

31:46.166 --> 31:48.511
killed Nicole Mitchell, we can
rule him out for that one too.

31:48.535 --> 31:49.879
Can we make it a trifecta?

31:49.903 --> 31:51.815
Yeah, I tracked Alex via street cams.

31:51.839 --> 31:53.349
After he left the pawn shop,
he went straight

31:53.373 --> 31:54.584
to the shooting gallery...

31:54.608 --> 31:56.352
didn't leave
till after the attack on Mona.

31:56.376 --> 31:58.488
So if Alex isn't the killer, then who is?

31:58.512 --> 32:01.458
Has to be someone with the same motive.

32:01.482 --> 32:02.625
Well, his father was pretty upset

32:02.649 --> 32:03.860
when we talked to him yesterday.

32:03.884 --> 32:05.228
He's got all the same reasons to be angry

32:05.252 --> 32:07.163
with anyone involved in Alex's case.

32:07.187 --> 32:10.166
His kid was gonna be someone.
Now he's just another ex-con.

32:10.190 --> 32:11.835
And at the hospital, Alex said

32:11.859 --> 32:13.169
that someone took Benny's gun.

32:13.193 --> 32:16.539
We know that he fought with his
father the morning of the shooting.

32:16.563 --> 32:18.641
Maybe he took it from him then.

32:18.665 --> 32:20.243
We got a cell number for Roman Bryant?

32:20.267 --> 32:22.167
I was just checking
cell site records now.

32:23.904 --> 32:25.982
Roman's phone pinged off towers
in the vicinity

32:26.006 --> 32:27.717
of all three shootings.

32:27.741 --> 32:29.152
Get a warrant.

32:36.116 --> 32:38.661
Roman Bryant, FBI!

32:47.761 --> 32:49.305
- Clear!
- Clear!

32:49.329 --> 32:50.373
He's not here.

32:56.270 --> 32:57.501
In here.

33:01.108 --> 33:02.752
Left that for his wife.

33:02.776 --> 33:04.554
"I'm sorry I couldn't say good-bye.

33:04.578 --> 33:06.890
"Hope you'll understand
why I had to do this.

33:06.914 --> 33:08.512
I love you."

33:09.283 --> 33:11.483
Sounds like a suicide note,
but I don't see a body.

33:13.420 --> 33:14.531
You don't need that many bullets

33:14.555 --> 33:16.388
if you're just planning to off yourself.

33:18.192 --> 33:20.025
He's going after more targets.

33:23.005 --> 33:25.467
Roman Bryant is in the wind
with a bunch of ammo

33:25.491 --> 33:27.677
and a burning desire to kill
everyone he blames

33:27.702 --> 33:29.513
for ruining his kid's life.

33:29.537 --> 33:32.516
I want updates on every
protective detail, please.

33:32.540 --> 33:33.918
And where are we with the judge?

33:33.942 --> 33:35.019
We track him down yet?

33:35.043 --> 33:37.621
He's on vacation in St. Lucia,
won't be back for another week.

33:37.645 --> 33:40.191
Okay, and what about the locations

33:40.215 --> 33:41.425
of the correction officers?

33:41.449 --> 33:43.027
They're both working
a nine to five shift.

33:43.051 --> 33:44.228
Hm.

33:44.252 --> 33:45.529
- Hey.
- Yeah?

33:45.553 --> 33:47.198
I've been going through
Roman's location data.

33:47.222 --> 33:48.465
Ever since the attack on Mona,

33:48.489 --> 33:50.301
he's been spending
a lot of time in the Bronx.

33:50.325 --> 33:52.336
Maybe he's looking for someone there.

33:52.360 --> 33:53.571
The fact we don't have another body

33:53.595 --> 33:55.439
means he hasn't found
the next person on his list.

33:55.463 --> 33:57.808
Question is, who is that person?

33:57.832 --> 33:59.176
Right.

33:59.200 --> 34:00.744
You know what? Let's talk to his son.

34:00.768 --> 34:02.813
- Maybe he knows.
- Okay.

34:08.376 --> 34:10.420
I thought I made it clear, all right?

34:10.445 --> 34:13.190
I'm done talking. What's the point?

34:13.214 --> 34:14.525
No one believes me anyway.

34:14.549 --> 34:17.016
Yeah, Alex, look, we know
that you didn't kill anyone.

34:18.518 --> 34:20.030
But your dad did.

34:22.857 --> 34:24.556
He's the one who took the gun, isn't he?

34:29.731 --> 34:32.743
Look, Alex, I get
trying to protect your dad,

34:32.766 --> 34:34.878
but it's too late for that.

34:34.902 --> 34:37.514
He left a note for your stepmom.

34:37.538 --> 34:40.217
He's gonna go kill other people
and then kill himself.

34:40.241 --> 34:42.686
We need to know. Who's he going after?

34:42.710 --> 34:44.521
Now's not the time
to keep your mouth shut.

34:44.545 --> 34:47.246
Alex, who else does your dad
blame for what happened to you?

34:49.751 --> 34:50.864
Himself.

34:52.453 --> 34:54.598
He blames himself.

34:54.621 --> 34:57.564
My dad's the one who told me
to keep my mouth shut.

34:59.594 --> 35:02.473
Ramirez said he'd kill our whole family,

35:02.497 --> 35:04.642
but that if I kept quiet,

35:04.666 --> 35:07.211
he promised to protect me in prison.

35:07.235 --> 35:09.068
But he didn't keep that promise, did he?

35:11.806 --> 35:13.017
My dad had no idea

35:13.041 --> 35:14.184
what happened to me on the inside,

35:14.208 --> 35:15.741
and I wasn't about to tell him.

35:17.478 --> 35:19.779
Until two days ago when you guys fought?

35:21.416 --> 35:23.294
He didn't understand.

35:23.318 --> 35:25.649
He didn't know why I was so...

35:27.188 --> 35:28.985
Screwed up.

35:29.324 --> 35:30.801
So you told him.

35:30.825 --> 35:32.836
Yeah.

35:33.267 --> 35:34.700
I told him everything.

35:36.331 --> 35:38.175
I'd never seen him so angry.

35:40.234 --> 35:44.448
No, my dad's a good man.

35:44.472 --> 35:47.718
All he ever wanted for me
was a better life than he had.

35:47.742 --> 35:51.822
He taught me how to play ball,
took me to all my practices,

35:51.846 --> 35:54.425
worked double shifts
to pay for my sneakers.

35:59.954 --> 36:02.978
But the thought of his son...

36:03.991 --> 36:05.624
getting raped...

36:07.694 --> 36:09.394
It made him crazy.

36:10.031 --> 36:13.277
Crazy enough to go after the
person you protected four years ago?

36:18.139 --> 36:19.950
If you don't tell us,
he will end up dead.

36:19.974 --> 36:21.006
Do you want that?

36:23.945 --> 36:27.391
It was Benny, all right?
He's going after Benny.

36:27.415 --> 36:28.647
Thank you.

36:30.251 --> 36:31.662
Roman's going after Benny Delgado.

36:31.686 --> 36:32.996
Who's got eyes on Benny?

36:33.020 --> 36:34.965
Patrol went by his apartment
and work... no sign of him.

36:34.989 --> 36:37.201
Well, he probably knows Roman's
looking for him, so he's laying low.

36:37.225 --> 36:38.535
- Jubal.
- Yeah.

36:38.559 --> 36:40.471
Roman's cell just pinged
off a tower in Norwood.

36:40.495 --> 36:43.173
Norwood, Norwood... hold on.

36:43.197 --> 36:44.508
Benny's aunt owns a house up there...

36:44.532 --> 36:45.876
220th and Detroit.

36:45.900 --> 36:47.311
Nice.

36:56.677 --> 36:57.710
That's him.

37:03.551 --> 37:05.117
Stop right there, Roman.

37:15.296 --> 37:17.908
Suspect's on foot headed
north in the alley.

37:17.932 --> 37:19.443
Get back in the house!

37:26.340 --> 37:28.007
Hey, go around back.

37:35.183 --> 37:36.894
Do not come any closer!

37:36.918 --> 37:38.384
Let her go, Roman.

37:41.989 --> 37:43.367
Listen, I don't wanna hurt her, okay?

37:43.391 --> 37:44.368
I... I just want Benny!

37:44.392 --> 37:45.891
That's not gonna happen!

37:47.328 --> 37:49.072
Put the gun down.

37:49.096 --> 37:50.407
Look, we just wanna talk to you.

37:50.431 --> 37:51.708
Talk? No, no, no.

37:51.732 --> 37:53.143
Ain't nothing to talk about.

37:53.167 --> 37:57.050
I know you blame yourself,
but this isn't your fault.

37:57.717 --> 37:59.817
Look, what choice did you have?

37:59.841 --> 38:01.819
Ramirez threatened you.

38:01.843 --> 38:04.388
You just did what you thought
was right for your family.

38:04.412 --> 38:07.624
You couldn't have known that
Alex would've been tried as an adult,

38:07.648 --> 38:10.327
or that it would all turn out like this.

38:10.351 --> 38:12.696
No, no, no.

38:13.173 --> 38:14.205
Roman...

38:15.456 --> 38:18.321
You didn't let Alex down, the system did.

38:19.627 --> 38:21.638
You don't understand.

38:21.662 --> 38:24.308
I let them take my boy.

38:24.332 --> 38:25.609
He'll never be the same...

38:47.855 --> 38:49.566
Great work today, everybody.

38:49.590 --> 38:51.835
Roman Bryant signed a full confession,

38:51.859 --> 38:54.505
and because of all of you, I get to tell

38:54.529 --> 38:57.129
Nicole Mitchell's father that
we caught his daughter's killer.

38:59.700 --> 39:01.912
Well, drinks on me.

39:01.936 --> 39:03.747
Oh, look at you, high roller.

39:03.771 --> 39:05.782
Oh, you know, might have
a little something

39:05.806 --> 39:07.951
socked away from my Wall Street days.

39:07.975 --> 39:09.820
Just not that place on Canal.

39:09.844 --> 39:11.855
Bartender keeps asking for my number.

39:11.879 --> 39:13.312
Hey, OA.

39:16.584 --> 39:18.529
I just wanted to let you know.

39:18.553 --> 39:20.364
I took the assignment.

39:22.623 --> 39:25.168
It was an opportunity I couldn't pass up.

39:25.192 --> 39:26.870
When do you start?

39:26.894 --> 39:28.427
Tomorrow.

39:31.265 --> 39:32.676
I don't suppose there's any chance

39:32.700 --> 39:33.877
I can talk you out of it?

39:33.901 --> 39:35.846
I figured you would say that.

39:35.870 --> 39:39.983
I was worried I would cave,
so I already told the ADIC.

39:43.650 --> 39:45.383
I'll be back before you know it.

39:46.247 --> 39:48.091
Well, you better be.

39:51.686 --> 39:53.416
Just be safe.

39:54.155 --> 39:55.532
Yeah, you too.

39:58.926 --> 40:01.672
Okay, go, go. They're waiting on you.
