                Would you pull
              yourself together?

24:05.477 --> 24:06.710
            It's Monday morning.

24:08.247 --> 24:09.680
    Jeannie!

24:09.682 --> 24:11.314
          Yes, master?

24:11.316 --> 24:13.183
  What have you
done with Sunday?

24:13.185 --> 24:15.786
Well, you said you wished there
were more work days in the week,

24:15.788 --> 24:18.055
  so I have taken away Sunday
   and given you two Mondays

24:18.057 --> 24:20.190
       because last week
     we had three Sundays.

24:20.192 --> 24:21.659
      Do you like Tuesday,
            master?

24:21.661 --> 24:23.226
          I think that
      is a very nice day.

24:23.228 --> 24:25.295
        And if you like,
 I can give you three Tuesdays.

24:28.500 --> 24:30.500
