00:31.984 --> 00:35.196
<i>The community is
outraged that convicted criminal Dr. Light...</i>

00:35.363 --> 00:39.116
<i>...has escaped incarceration again,
embarking on a deadly spree.</i>

00:39.283 --> 00:42.078
<i>Tensions between Bialya
and Pokolistan reached new heights...</i>

00:42.245 --> 00:44.288
<i>...when Bialya
disregarded U. N. sanctions...</i>

00:44.455 --> 00:46.707
<i>...and pushed into settlements
across the border.</i>

00:46.874 --> 00:49.502
<i>Three strikes?
This is the law, not baseball.</i>

00:49.669 --> 00:53.798
<i>If a man commits a felony, he should
be expunged from civilized society.</i>

00:53.965 --> 00:57.301
<i>Victims' families are asking how
such a tragedy could have taken place.</i>

00:57.468 --> 01:01.430
<i>Luckily, Superman arrived in
time to avert the terror attack.</i>

01:02.640 --> 01:05.016
<i>- Military deaths in Middle East...
- Polls show...</i>

01:05.184 --> 01:06.352
<i>...more often afraid than not.</i>

01:06.519 --> 01:09.397
<i>- Where are our heroes?
- Sources describe the woman as kind.</i>

01:09.563 --> 01:13.276
<i>...when nations are not held
accountable for their actions...</i>

01:16.195 --> 01:18.990
Time to take your medicine, love.

02:21.594 --> 02:24.388
- Easy as pie, didn't I tell you?
- I like pie.

02:24.555 --> 02:27.224
You're about to go on a diet.

02:28.809 --> 02:31.937
Superman! Blast him!

02:36.901 --> 02:40.112
- Oh, oh! Oh, oh!
- Why don't you two cool off?

02:43.616 --> 02:47.828
- Caught a couple of big fish, Superman.
- And without a net.

02:51.457 --> 02:56.045
Back to the tank with you two.
Up, up and away.

02:56.212 --> 03:00.132
Maybe this time they'll learn
that crime doesn't pay.

03:03.135 --> 03:07.181
Wow, okay. Ha-ha. That's, uh... Wow.

03:07.348 --> 03:10.142
It never occurred to me
that the S stood for "silly."

03:10.309 --> 03:11.811
It wasn't that bad.

03:11.977 --> 03:13.979
When have you ever said
"crime doesn't pay"?

03:17.525 --> 03:20.611
Well, you can take
the kid out of the cornfield...

03:20.778 --> 03:22.655
Producer said it would be inspirational.

03:22.822 --> 03:26.325
And who's profiting
from all this so-called inspiration?

03:26.492 --> 03:29.286
Proceeds from the cartoon
go to charity, Lois.

03:29.453 --> 03:30.955
Yes, I've got someone watching.

03:31.122 --> 03:33.666
And yes, we have an iron-clad contract.

03:33.833 --> 03:36.502
And do you get creative input?

03:36.836 --> 03:39.004
Did I mention it all goes to charity?

03:39.171 --> 03:41.674
Point is, you have to protect your S.

03:41.841 --> 03:44.343
The world is always watching Superman.

03:44.510 --> 03:46.345
Well, not always.

03:46.512 --> 03:48.848
Oh. Smooth one, farm boy.

03:53.352 --> 03:55.187
So close.

03:58.941 --> 04:01.193
- Help me!
- My God.

04:18.668 --> 04:20.921
- The Atomic Skull.
- Get somewhere safe.

04:55.789 --> 04:57.625
You've gone too far this time, Skull.

04:57.791 --> 05:01.086
They were just lawyers.
Come closer and we'll talk about it.

05:01.253 --> 05:02.922
You've gotten bigger.

05:03.088 --> 05:04.924
That genebomb that created me...

05:05.090 --> 05:07.426
...it's still going off.

05:32.326 --> 05:34.036
Let go!

05:43.128 --> 05:45.381
- Cute.
- Why did you attack those people?

05:45.548 --> 05:48.133
To draw out the main course, of course.

05:48.300 --> 05:50.469
- You used them for bait?
- Give me a break.

05:50.636 --> 05:53.430
I do what I do, you do what you do.

06:54.700 --> 06:57.119
You'll have your front page
in 15 minutes, chief.

06:57.286 --> 06:58.746
Yes, I'll spell-check.

07:15.304 --> 07:16.889
Okay, beat it.

07:22.144 --> 07:23.687
Whoa.

07:30.235 --> 07:32.154
Here we are, lads and lassie.

07:32.321 --> 07:35.032
Makes the old hometown
look positively quaint.

07:35.199 --> 07:37.951
Mm. Makes me thirsty.

07:42.748 --> 07:46.919
They grow them big here,
but not as big as Blue Boy.

07:47.086 --> 07:48.671
Keep your pants on, Pammy.

07:48.837 --> 07:51.090
We don't need you
getting all beasty now.

07:51.256 --> 07:53.676
- Where do you think he is?
- I'll find him.

07:53.842 --> 07:57.346
Just stay tight.
First impressions, you know.

08:02.601 --> 08:04.770
- He don't like you.
- I don't like him.

08:11.026 --> 08:13.862
So was this justice, Superman?

08:14.029 --> 08:16.115
Millions in property damage...

08:16.281 --> 08:19.493
...helpless bystanders killed
by a repeat metahuman felon...

08:19.660 --> 08:23.622
...who's now enjoying three square meals
a day as a guest of the state.

08:24.123 --> 08:28.836
You had the power to end Atomic Skull's
criminal career right there permanently.

08:29.002 --> 08:30.462
Why didn't you?

08:30.629 --> 08:33.131
I'm not anyone's judge and jury,
Professor Baxter.

08:33.298 --> 08:34.842
Definitely not an executioner.

08:35.008 --> 08:37.219
My powers don't put me above the law.

08:37.385 --> 08:42.015
A noble sentiment. But are you the
Superman that the 21st century needs?

08:42.182 --> 08:45.144
Why not use your power
to fix the world?

08:45.644 --> 08:48.230
Let me reiterate that
I'm playing devil's advocate.

08:48.397 --> 08:50.190
I'm a huge fan.

08:51.567 --> 08:54.653
- Not embarrassing at all.
- Your dad?

08:54.820 --> 08:55.863
Could do worse.

08:56.029 --> 08:58.991
First, I don't believe
that the world is broken.

08:59.158 --> 09:02.619
Because when we say the world,
we're really talking about people.

09:02.786 --> 09:06.540
And it's always been my belief
that people at their core are good.

09:06.832 --> 09:10.210
- Ha.
- The grace of mankind is everywhere.

09:10.377 --> 09:12.337
You just have to open your eyes.

09:12.504 --> 09:15.674
Humanity has a limitless
potential for good.

09:15.841 --> 09:19.261
My purpose is to help people
reach that potential.

09:19.428 --> 09:21.889
Tamarev. Tamarev is under attack.

09:22.055 --> 09:23.682
What have you people done?

09:23.849 --> 09:26.727
How dare you?
Pokolistan holds to the treaty.

09:26.894 --> 09:30.022
Liar. My people are dying in the streets.

09:30.189 --> 09:31.690
No less than they deserve.

09:31.857 --> 09:33.442
Limitless potential for good?

09:33.609 --> 09:35.861
Good isn't perfect. I have to go.

09:36.278 --> 09:37.905
To be continued, professor?

09:38.071 --> 09:39.531
This is an act of war.

09:39.907 --> 09:42.326
Not while you press our borders.

09:49.958 --> 09:51.835
<i>Reports are streaming in from Tamarev...</i>

09:52.002 --> 09:54.505
<i>...capital of the Eastern Bloc
nation of Bialya.</i>

09:54.671 --> 09:58.592
<i>We're trying to get someone on the ground,
but as we've been reporting for weeks...</i>

09:58.759 --> 10:03.388
<i>...diplomatic efforts between Bialya
and neighboring Pokolistan have collapsed</i>

10:04.139 --> 10:07.226
<i>Both countries have access
to considerable technology.</i>

10:07.392 --> 10:10.646
<i>Weapons of mass destruction
could come into play.</i>

10:24.159 --> 10:26.870
<i>The U.N. has tried to intervene...</i>

10:27.037 --> 10:29.248
<i>Wait, I'm sorry, we 're getting something.</i>

10:35.504 --> 10:40.259
<i>Oh, God. We've heard rumors about
Pokolistan's bio-weapons program.</i>

10:40.425 --> 10:42.094
<i>But this</i>

11:04.533 --> 11:06.451
- One of yours?
- No.

12:31.662 --> 12:33.372
Oi. You in the <i>cape.</i>

12:34.456 --> 12:38.543
<i>The bastard doesn't have a brain or I'd have
had him rip his own guts out already.</i>

12:38.710 --> 12:42.589
<i>He's still alive, so if you don't mind
setting aside the kid gloves...</i>

13:06.446 --> 13:08.907
- Come back from that.
- <i>Nice</i> one, brother.

13:09.074 --> 13:11.952
<i>But you could use a smidge more flair.</i>

13:12.411 --> 13:13.745
Okay.

13:26.591 --> 13:28.135
Flair, mon frÃ¨re.

13:29.511 --> 13:30.762
Who's a good sorcerer?

13:30.929 --> 13:33.181
Double pork fried rice for you tonight.

13:34.307 --> 13:36.351
You sure know how to make an entrance.

13:36.518 --> 13:39.855
Thanks for the assist. Next time,
double-check for collateral damage.

13:40.022 --> 13:42.107
Came a little close there.

13:44.109 --> 13:46.653
- Hello.
- You're really tall.

13:48.113 --> 13:50.198
Don't mind them, Mr. Superman, sir.

13:50.365 --> 13:52.951
Big fans. Paralytic with giddiness.

13:53.118 --> 13:57.247
So before anyone
does anything embarrassing: Ta.

13:57.456 --> 13:59.458
Wait. Who are y...?

14:06.298 --> 14:08.216
Where did they come from?
Where did they go?

14:08.383 --> 14:10.802
What do they want?
What's all over that woman's body?

14:10.969 --> 14:13.889
These four are the biggest news
since Brainiac ate Boston.

14:14.056 --> 14:16.683
Someone's gonna break this story
and it better be us.

14:16.850 --> 14:20.562
It's a given that I am getting
the scoop on these newbies, right?

14:20.729 --> 14:23.065
Not unless you can type
5000 words a minute.

14:23.231 --> 14:27.027
Do not make me unleash
my feminine wiles on you, Clark Kent.

14:28.487 --> 14:30.072
Too late.

14:30.238 --> 14:33.450
For someone who plays fair,
you can really suck sometimes.

14:33.617 --> 14:35.368
"Telekinetic.

14:35.535 --> 14:38.163
Conjured a dragon out of thin air."

14:38.330 --> 14:39.873
Outstanding, Kent.

14:40.040 --> 14:43.085
- Been on the phone with your source?
- Tweeting, actually, sir.

14:43.251 --> 14:45.921
Take point on this.
Book a flight wherever you need to go.

14:46.088 --> 14:48.673
Take Lane if she's still talking to you.

14:50.175 --> 14:52.511
Hope you like cold showers, Smallville.

14:52.677 --> 14:54.179
You spoke to Superman?

14:54.346 --> 14:56.848
What did he say?
Are these guys the real deal or what?

14:59.810 --> 15:02.270
The jury's still out, Jimmy.
He said they're strong.

15:02.437 --> 15:04.898
Really strong.
But there's something about them.

15:05.065 --> 15:07.067
Looks like they did
a pretty good job to me.

15:07.234 --> 15:09.861
If you boys are done gossiping,
some lady in England...

15:10.028 --> 15:13.990
...just went online claiming to know
all about Superman's new best friends.

15:17.953 --> 15:20.705
- Sorry there's no movie.
- Don't try to be cute.

15:20.872 --> 15:22.833
You're lucky I'm letting you fly me there.

15:22.999 --> 15:25.710
Once we hit the ground,
it's every reporter for herself.

15:25.877 --> 15:27.796
Unless I get something really juicy.

15:27.963 --> 15:29.881
Ah. Learning.

15:38.557 --> 15:40.725
I practically raised the lad.

15:40.892 --> 15:45.897
He played football in me garden
and teased me cats, the rascal. Ha-ha.

15:46.064 --> 15:49.067
But a big heart, oh, a big heart.

15:49.234 --> 15:51.611
Always helped come harvest.

15:51.778 --> 15:53.238
What's his name, Mrs. Munsch?

15:53.405 --> 15:55.657
It's not for me to say, is it?

15:55.824 --> 15:58.743
Unless you're willing to pay
for the exclusive.

15:58.910 --> 16:01.955
If she knows anything,
I'm the Martian Manhunter.

16:02.122 --> 16:03.999
There go all of my fantasies.

16:04.166 --> 16:07.335
I'm gonna go knock down some doors.
Call me if you get anything.

16:07.502 --> 16:10.005
- You too.
- We'll see.

16:13.592 --> 16:17.929
I'll tell it all. How he saved
Churchill from that nasty Doberman.

16:18.096 --> 16:19.598
With just his brain.

16:19.764 --> 16:21.725
Quite the looker.

16:21.892 --> 16:25.187
Your reporter friend.
I'm not into the golden oldies.

16:26.271 --> 16:29.774
Subspace teleport pods.
All the cool HQs have them.

16:29.941 --> 16:32.444
So are you stalking me
or are you here for the scenery?

16:32.611 --> 16:35.280
You never gave me your cell.
Had to start somewhere.

16:35.447 --> 16:37.324
Quite the detective. Following the guy...

16:37.490 --> 16:41.036
...with the Union Jack
tatted to his chest to England? Heh.

16:41.870 --> 16:44.122
Come on, I'm just breaking
your boots, Superman.

16:44.289 --> 16:46.208
Truth is I ramble when I get nervous...

16:46.374 --> 16:49.794
...and I'm in a bit of a twist
having a jaw with Superman. Ha.

16:50.295 --> 16:52.964
- Let's start with your name.
- Manchester Black.

16:53.131 --> 16:57.302
Aspiring do-gooder and all-around
pain in the ass at your service.

16:57.469 --> 16:59.387
You wanna talk? Let's talk.

16:59.554 --> 17:03.558
Just not here.
Never could stand the smell of the place.

17:16.988 --> 17:18.198
Feeding time.

17:18.365 --> 17:20.617
Hey, some parsnips and carrots.

17:20.784 --> 17:22.661
Good for the skin.

17:22.827 --> 17:26.330
- This is inhuman.
- Just think what a service you're providing...

17:26.498 --> 17:29.709
...having all your energy
sucked into the city's electronic grid.

17:29.876 --> 17:32.337
It's almost like
you cooked your own supper.

17:49.688 --> 17:52.482
Incoming. It's the big guy.

17:56.319 --> 17:57.779
Hello, again.

17:58.238 --> 18:00.365
Come on, you lot. He doesn't bite.

18:00.532 --> 18:01.658
That's a pity.

18:01.825 --> 18:03.702
Big fella goes by Coldcast.

18:03.868 --> 18:06.204
The Hat's our resident master
of hocus-pocus...

18:06.371 --> 18:08.456
...and fortune cookie wordsmith.

18:08.623 --> 18:12.544
Your lucky numbers are four, eight, 15...

18:12.711 --> 18:15.463
- ...and...
- I'm Menagerie, but you can call me Pam.

18:16.047 --> 18:18.216
At this number. Anytime.

18:21.886 --> 18:23.555
Down, girl.

18:24.597 --> 18:29.227
Good to meet you all. Thank you again for
what you did in Bialya, but we need to talk.

18:29.394 --> 18:31.938
Of course. Someone comes sniffing
around your tomato...

18:32.105 --> 18:35.650
...so to speak, you need to get a look-see.
Due diligence.

18:35.817 --> 18:38.695
We're an open book.
So if you'll just relax...

18:38.862 --> 18:41.948
Sorry. I heard your
telepathic shout before.

18:42.115 --> 18:45.744
But my mind is protected from anything
deeper by a series of psychic blocks.

18:45.910 --> 18:47.370
Best I've seen too.

18:47.537 --> 18:50.999
Got a few skeletons rattling around
up there you don't want out?

18:52.625 --> 18:56.087
I'm not looking for your deepest, darkest.
Showing is faster than telling.

18:56.254 --> 18:58.423
I hate to hear me own voice,
believe it or not.

18:58.590 --> 19:01.718
Don't believe him.
Only thing shuts him up is a soccer game.

19:01.885 --> 19:04.721
Football, you uneducated Yank.

19:05.263 --> 19:09.142
This is low-level stuff, Supes.
Promise. Like telly in HD.

19:09.976 --> 19:12.062
- All right.
- Apologies in advance...

19:12.228 --> 19:14.773
...for the graphic nature
of what you're about to see.

19:14.939 --> 19:17.609
Some of us had it rough
in the origin department.

19:31.748 --> 19:34.542
I'm off, then. See you at dinner.

19:39.089 --> 19:43.093
Lucky I give you a roof and a pillow,
you worthless squib.

19:46.638 --> 19:49.808
You want something to eat?
Work it out for yourself.

19:49.974 --> 19:51.684
Take the girl with you.

19:52.477 --> 19:54.396
Can't stand her mewling.

20:04.989 --> 20:07.117
It's a Cinderella story, really.

20:07.283 --> 20:09.536
I was the unplanned fifth
of five boys...

20:09.702 --> 20:13.331
...left to fend for meself after me mum died
giving birth to number six.

20:13.498 --> 20:15.333
The only girl. Vera.

20:18.795 --> 20:21.172
Ooh. What's wrong, love?

20:22.465 --> 20:25.135
I lost my mum!

20:27.345 --> 20:31.349
Oh, don't fret, dear.
We'll find your mum.

20:31.516 --> 20:33.059
The only good thing I had.

20:33.226 --> 20:35.895
Brothers had all gone off
and wound up dead or in jail...

20:36.062 --> 20:37.856
...where they wound up dead anyway.

20:38.022 --> 20:40.066
But Vera, she was special.

20:40.233 --> 20:41.985
Did what I could to protect her.

20:42.152 --> 20:46.156
But really, she was always
taking care of me, till that summer.

20:46.322 --> 20:48.658
Plenty of loose wallets in Heaton Park.

20:48.825 --> 20:51.536
Not proud of it, but hungry is hungry.

20:51.703 --> 20:55.039
- Good day! Let's get ice cream before...
- Aah!

20:57.125 --> 20:59.544
Thought it was puberty,
you know. Headaches.

20:59.711 --> 21:02.255
The feeling that my body
was turning against me.

21:02.422 --> 21:04.382
But it was getting worse by the week.

21:04.549 --> 21:06.050
But that day...

21:06.426 --> 21:08.303
There's one of them.

21:09.220 --> 21:11.556
I couldn't stand. Couldn't run.

21:11.723 --> 21:14.392
A damn cripple. If it wasn't for Vera...

21:14.851 --> 21:16.603
Sod off, copper.

21:35.747 --> 21:37.081
No!

21:39.083 --> 21:40.919
Vera!

21:41.085 --> 21:45.423
It was a frigging horror show.
Me, on my knees. Vera screaming.

21:45.590 --> 21:48.426
And I was helpless,
praying for it all to stop.

21:48.593 --> 21:50.386
Imagine my shock when it did.

22:03.107 --> 22:06.110
Goodbye, headaches. Hello, power.

22:13.785 --> 22:15.620
After that it's the usual fish tale.

22:15.787 --> 22:18.456
Her Majesty's secret service took notice,
gave me a bed...

22:18.623 --> 22:21.960
...and taught me about hurting
bad people in the name of freedom.

22:22.126 --> 22:25.505
Met this lot during a particularly
disenfranchising tour in Africa...

22:25.672 --> 22:28.675
...and we decided to make a go of it
freelance, like yourself.

22:28.841 --> 22:30.385
The rest is current events.

22:30.552 --> 22:32.554
Your sister, did she make it?

22:33.179 --> 22:36.099
We don't all get happy endings, Superm...
Aah!

22:36.266 --> 22:37.850
Chester!

22:39.143 --> 22:43.189
- What's wrong?
- Screams. Lots of screams.

22:47.443 --> 22:51.573
Smoke and electrical discharge
in both tubes. Evac all trains.

22:55.827 --> 22:58.413
Not an accident.
- this is an attack.

23:01.958 --> 23:06.629
They've hit us on the east end too.
Both ends of the Chunnel are sealed off.

23:08.172 --> 23:10.466
This is not right.
This should not be happening.

23:10.717 --> 23:12.760
Sweet heavenly father.

23:17.807 --> 23:19.892
- Captain.
- Oh, thank God.

23:20.059 --> 23:22.228
We have simultaneous attacks
at both openings.

23:22.395 --> 23:24.814
The trains are trapped inside,
filled to capacity.

23:24.981 --> 23:26.024
Flooding has begun to...

23:26.190 --> 23:28.693
Melt the blockage to slag
and drag the lorries out.

23:28.860 --> 23:31.195
No time. The superstructure
has been compromised.

23:31.362 --> 23:32.655
Collapse is imminent.

23:32.822 --> 23:34.532
Can you teleport the passengers?

23:34.699 --> 23:36.159
Teleport pod's back home, mate.

23:36.326 --> 23:39.370
We're great kicking the snot
out of wankers, but this...

23:39.537 --> 23:44.208
This is a test of your imagination.
How strong are you?

24:05.897 --> 24:08.441
- This for real, Ches?
- Real as it gets.

24:08.608 --> 24:10.068
You got the power he needs?

24:10.234 --> 24:13.071
Don't... Just don't ask.

24:18.826 --> 24:20.370
<i>Get ready, Black.</i>

24:22.288 --> 24:25.541
Like your mum! Hat, you're on deck.

24:34.050 --> 24:35.385
Now!

24:45.103 --> 24:47.271
Take <i>it</i> up!

25:11.170 --> 25:13.047
Damn, he doing it'?

25:17.218 --> 25:19.554
Not by himself, sweet thing.

25:19.721 --> 25:21.973
If you two are doing pissing about...

25:27.770 --> 25:29.105
Got him!

25:31.232 --> 25:32.775
Hat!

25:44.620 --> 25:46.372
Tell me he's got that thing trained.

26:19.071 --> 26:22.700
Not bad for a guy who
just kicks the snot out of wankers.

26:28.164 --> 26:30.166
Well, I'll be damned. We did it.

26:30.333 --> 26:32.502
Looks like you guys
are gonna need a name soon.

26:32.668 --> 26:34.420
Guess what we found.

26:35.963 --> 26:37.006
- Bastards!
- Manchester!

26:37.590 --> 26:39.425
Who put you up to this?

26:40.384 --> 26:44.055
- Easy, Manchester.
- Not chatty? Fine.

26:47.141 --> 26:51.020
Pokolistani tweaked about
England's support of Bialya.

26:51.187 --> 26:53.231
You're killing them! Stop!

26:55.233 --> 26:57.735
Can't just let them get away with it,
though, can we?

26:57.902 --> 26:59.904
We won't, but not like that.

27:00.071 --> 27:02.740
Why the hell not?
No less than they deserve.

27:06.369 --> 27:09.247
Call this one a win
and save the philosophy for the pub, then?

27:09.413 --> 27:12.250
- Definitely.
- Hey, hero. Mm.

27:16.504 --> 27:20.174
So was it the trashy outfit,
or should I start gluing slugs to my face?

27:20.341 --> 27:22.927
- Maybe an iguana.
- It was a moment.

27:23.094 --> 27:24.428
Pam was overexcited.

27:24.595 --> 27:27.598
Pam? One team-up and she's Pam.

27:27.765 --> 27:31.018
We saved a few hundred people, Lois.
What can I say?

27:31.185 --> 27:34.021
They're new and... excitable.

27:34.814 --> 27:39.944
That excitability better stay one-sided,
though you don't exactly sound like a fan.

27:40.111 --> 27:41.279
Not sure I am.

27:41.445 --> 27:43.281
You're the minority. The net's on fire.

27:43.447 --> 27:45.908
- People love these guys.
- They didn't see the part...

27:46.075 --> 27:49.537
...where Black almost lobotomized
the two Pokolistani terrorists.

27:49.704 --> 27:52.081
- That would have sealed it.
- What do you mean?

27:52.248 --> 27:55.293
I mean some people think terrorists
should get what they deserve...

27:55.459 --> 27:57.461
...as slowly and painfully as possible.

27:57.628 --> 27:58.963
Is that what you believe?

28:00.548 --> 28:03.676
Some days, yeah.

28:05.845 --> 28:09.724
I checked with the <i>London</i> Mirror while you
were making kissy faces with Lady Furby.

28:09.891 --> 28:12.602
They couldn't confirm any
of Black's story.

28:12.768 --> 28:16.480
- What about the sister?
- No birth record. No death certificate.

28:16.647 --> 28:19.650
- So he's lying?
- Don't know. We need to go deeper.

28:19.817 --> 28:22.987
If he did work for the government,
his files could be...

28:23.738 --> 28:25.615
Okay.

28:26.574 --> 28:27.617
Lois.

28:30.453 --> 28:33.623
<i>Evening, morning,
and afternoon to one and all...</i>

28:33.789 --> 28:35.583
<i>...wherever you happen to be.</i>

28:35.750 --> 28:38.085
<i>Please forgive this brief
but important message...</i>

28:38.252 --> 28:40.504
<i>...regarding the safety
of the civilized world.</i>

28:40.671 --> 28:43.674
How are they doing this?
Can you do this?

28:43.841 --> 28:45.927
<i>This is</i> a <i>call-out
to the shadow cabinets</i>

28:46.093 --> 28:49.347
<i>petty dictators
and all-around tossers of the world.</i>

28:49.513 --> 28:50.973
<i>You're on notice.</i>

28:51.140 --> 28:54.352
<i>We're not bound by lines on a map
or political alliances...</i>

28:54.518 --> 28:56.771
<i>...or governing bodies of any kind.</i>

28:56.938 --> 29:00.524
<i>We are our own bosses,
and we have a very simple job.</i>

29:00.691 --> 29:03.319
<i>There are the good guys, namely us...</i>

29:03.486 --> 29:07.198
<i>...and the bad guys, namely anyone
who treats anyone else like trash...</i>

29:07.365 --> 29:09.033
<i>...to further their petty aims.</i>

29:09.200 --> 29:11.369
<i>We turn bad guys into memories.</i>

29:11.535 --> 29:14.121
<i>So mind your manners, lads and lasses...</i>

29:14.288 --> 29:16.207
<i>...or we'll blow your house down.</i>

29:16.374 --> 29:18.042
<i>We're the Elite.</i>

29:18.459 --> 29:21.545
<i>You asked for us, world. Now you got us.</i>

29:21.712 --> 29:25.174
At least they picked a name. Clark?

29:27.718 --> 29:30.888
Ha-ha. All right!
Finally someone's got a pair!

29:31.055 --> 29:33.140
See, Dad? That's how you do it.

29:33.307 --> 29:36.727
No one's gonna pull something
with the Elite watching.

29:36.894 --> 29:39.772
Everyone likes a shiny new penny,
but it doesn't mean that...

29:39.939 --> 29:41.148
Lois.

29:42.233 --> 29:43.901
Get your coat.

29:49.407 --> 29:52.034
That'll give them something
to gab about.

29:54.370 --> 29:55.746
Viva the Elite!

29:55.913 --> 29:57.540
Have another, you git.

29:57.707 --> 30:00.042
Meanwhile, back at our secret HQ...

30:00.209 --> 30:03.337
...we continue our chat
with the two unluckiest sods on the planet.

30:03.504 --> 30:06.048
The slobs at the other end
of the Chunnel.

30:06.966 --> 30:10.302
Your mates got off easy,
and you can as well.

30:11.887 --> 30:13.764
Spill your guts, so we don't have to.

30:13.931 --> 30:15.516
Pretty please.

30:17.393 --> 30:19.854
Guess it's a woman's touch, then.

30:24.191 --> 30:28.612
You like picking on those weaker than you.
Defenseless.

30:32.324 --> 30:33.784
No! No!

30:38.706 --> 30:40.833
No! Keep her away from me.

31:02.480 --> 31:05.149
The metahumans designated
the Elite are not anywhere...

31:05.316 --> 31:07.234
...within the range of our scanners.

31:07.401 --> 31:10.863
Their message was downloaded
through a post-dimensional channel.

31:11.030 --> 31:12.823
I think my phone has an app for that.

31:12.990 --> 31:15.159
It means they're hiding
between dimensions.

31:15.326 --> 31:16.744
Impossible to track.

31:16.911 --> 31:22.708
Though we are currently processing
3,500,405 Internet hits on the Elite.

31:22.875 --> 31:24.585
How many of them are informational?

31:25.377 --> 31:26.420
Zero.

31:26.587 --> 31:28.339
How many of them contain the phrase:

31:28.506 --> 31:31.133
- "These guys rock"?
- 2,800,000...

31:31.300 --> 31:34.095
I need something. A location.

31:41.185 --> 31:45.481
Do you think the world has moved on
to a place where I can't follow?

31:45.648 --> 31:48.692
Sir, a spatial disruption matching
the Elite's energy signature...

31:48.859 --> 31:51.570
...has been detected over Bialya.

31:56.742 --> 31:59.620
Which one of you tin cans
is gonna get me back to England?

32:01.956 --> 32:03.374
<i>Thank God for the Elite!</i>

32:03.541 --> 32:06.961
<i>Finally someone with the power
to say what we're all thinking.</i>

32:07.128 --> 32:08.462
<i>Not all of us</i>

32:08.629 --> 32:11.507
"Might makes right" has never been
a productive philosophy.

32:11.674 --> 32:15.511
So instead, you'd rather have tea
with terrorists.

32:15.678 --> 32:17.888
Demitasse with dictators.

32:18.055 --> 32:22.560
Of course not, but set aside the rhetoric
and analyze what Mr. Black said.

32:22.726 --> 32:24.770
<i>He said he's gonna kick some ass!</i>

32:24.937 --> 32:29.316
<i>Without the rule of international
law, diplomacy, dialogue.</i>

32:29.483 --> 32:32.570
Dialogue? There are people
you cannot talk to.

32:32.736 --> 32:35.030
That's who the Elite are for.

32:35.197 --> 32:38.701
What happens when the Elite turn
their attentions away from those people...

32:38.868 --> 32:41.996
- ...and turn them towards you?
- Why the hell would they do that?

32:42.163 --> 32:44.957
I'm American! We're the good guys.

33:30.628 --> 33:33.297
American scum!
Today you die.

33:33.964 --> 33:36.300
And Bialya falls.

33:38.636 --> 33:40.054
Wait.

33:41.138 --> 33:42.431
What?

34:04.954 --> 34:08.623
They have microwave popcorn
in your terror-ass country?

34:44.994 --> 34:46.745
Goodnight, ladies.

34:55.754 --> 34:57.506
You got terrorist on you.

34:57.673 --> 34:59.049
Ck.

35:03.679 --> 35:06.557
No worries, mate. It's all over now.

35:32.875 --> 35:34.084
Chill a minute.

35:34.251 --> 35:37.755
We've had you on a solar energy drip,
but your brain's still a wreck.

35:38.213 --> 35:40.341
My bad. Didn't see you flying in.

35:40.507 --> 35:44.053
Neutrino pulse.
It's like an EMP for organics.

35:44.219 --> 35:47.056
Stops the electrons in your brain
from flowing for a second.

35:47.222 --> 35:49.099
Makes everyone go nappy-time...

35:49.266 --> 35:51.852
...unless you are in armor, apparently.

35:52.019 --> 35:55.773
Considering the hit you took,
it's a bloody miracle you stayed conscious.

35:59.360 --> 36:00.611
You...

36:01.070 --> 36:03.781
No need to thank us,
though cash would be grand.

36:04.490 --> 36:06.575
Kidding. How about the tour?

36:06.742 --> 36:09.328
It's less boring
when you're half in the bag.

36:09.495 --> 36:13.248
Even with his ass kicked,
it's still a fine ass.

36:13.415 --> 36:15.626
Remember who kicked it, baby.

36:21.465 --> 36:23.300
Totally flash, eh?

36:24.051 --> 36:25.552
She's not just a ship.

36:25.719 --> 36:29.473
She's actually the biggest silicone-based
bacteria colony in the universe.

36:29.640 --> 36:31.809
Well, this universe.

36:31.975 --> 36:34.853
Sounds gross, I know,
but she's fast as crap through a goose...

36:35.020 --> 36:38.982
...and ducks between dimensions.
Complete privacy and gives traffic the finger.

36:39.149 --> 36:40.651
Named her Bunny.

36:43.487 --> 36:45.489
We think she had the capacity to feel...

36:45.656 --> 36:48.992
...so we jettisoned her emotion nodules
a few ticks back.

36:49.159 --> 36:50.702
Seemed the humane thing to do.

36:50.869 --> 36:54.289
You killed them!
Murdered the Pokolistani soldiers.

36:54.456 --> 36:56.583
No offense,
but someone had to do something...

36:56.750 --> 36:58.669
...while you were playing spastic
on the floor.

37:00.129 --> 37:02.589
Aww. Hat! Every time we win a battle...

37:02.756 --> 37:05.884
...he gets knackered
and pukes all over the place.

37:08.011 --> 37:12.516
This isn't a joke. You can't murder people
and call yourselves heroes.

37:12.683 --> 37:15.477
Why not?
Your government does it all the time.

37:17.771 --> 37:21.567
Look, Supes, when we take down
the baddies, they stay down.

37:21.733 --> 37:25.028
- Isn't that better for everyone?
- We are not above the law.

37:25.195 --> 37:28.407
We have to show the world
that there's a better way.

37:28.615 --> 37:32.703
- That people can be better.
- But that's the problem. They can't.

37:37.458 --> 37:39.626
The world's overflowing
with sick puppies.

37:39.793 --> 37:41.837
Original sin in 36 flavors.

37:42.004 --> 37:45.507
I'm not an idiot.
I know there are bad men in power.

37:45.674 --> 37:49.511
It's not a perfect world, but we can't just
throw morality in the garbage.

37:49.678 --> 37:52.431
You don't have a clue what it means
to live in fear, do you?

37:52.598 --> 37:54.683
To wonder why no one can
stop the bogeymen...

37:54.850 --> 37:57.269
...who knock down skyscrapers
or blow up schools.

37:57.436 --> 37:59.855
Well, we do. Human beings do.

38:00.022 --> 38:02.733
We understand fear all too well.

38:06.987 --> 38:10.949
So now we're wiping the Earth
free of scum, and they love us for it.

38:12.201 --> 38:15.287
It can't be this way. You know that.

38:15.454 --> 38:16.705
I can't allow it.

38:16.872 --> 38:18.665
You're welcome for the rescue.

38:19.166 --> 38:20.250
Bunny.

38:20.834 --> 38:22.127
Black!

38:26.256 --> 38:30.260
Um... If this is a problem,
I can cut you in 10 percent.

38:31.094 --> 38:35.015
As has been repeatedly stated,
Ms. Lane, MI5 does not confirm nor deny...

38:35.182 --> 38:38.393
Forget it. I got the message loud and clear,
Double-No Useless.

38:49.530 --> 38:52.741
Just checking in to report
nothing from British Intelligence...

38:52.908 --> 38:54.743
...which is a major oxymoron
right now.

38:54.910 --> 38:56.787
You're barking up the wrong forest.

38:57.621 --> 39:02.626
As far as MI5 is concerned,
there is no Manchester Black.

39:04.545 --> 39:09.132
And are you here to tell me differently,
or am I about to get shot in the face?

39:15.597 --> 39:18.183
The world needs to know
what they're dealing with.

39:20.644 --> 39:21.895
Vera?

39:23.814 --> 39:27.317
Ches isn't the only one who worked
for the queen and had his history wiped.

39:27.484 --> 39:28.986
Hope it helps.

39:29.820 --> 39:30.821
Why?

39:30.988 --> 39:35.158
Because my brother is misguided
and angry, but he saved my life.

39:35.659 --> 39:38.370
I'd like to save his, if I can.

39:44.126 --> 39:46.336
Shall we return to Metropolis,
Miss Lane?

40:00.434 --> 40:04.146
Knock, knock, skullhead. Yummy time.

40:05.480 --> 40:08.108
Almost had some excitement there.

40:19.494 --> 40:21.705
The excitement's just starting.

40:39.014 --> 40:41.391
Been a lot of talk. Not much of it good.

40:41.558 --> 40:45.395
Had to put a slap on Ben Farnsworth
on account of he said you looked the fool.

40:45.562 --> 40:46.855
I did, Pa.

40:47.022 --> 40:48.273
They sucker-punched you.

40:48.440 --> 40:50.400
Sucker-teleported, technically.

40:51.109 --> 40:53.737
So even Smallville's rooting for the Elite.

40:54.279 --> 40:56.740
Well, just the loud, angry and stupid.

40:56.907 --> 40:58.450
Come on, it's not that simple.

40:58.617 --> 41:01.244
I don't think that
I make them feel safe anymore.

41:01.411 --> 41:02.913
The way I do things.

41:03.914 --> 41:05.916
Clark, when people are scared...

41:06.083 --> 41:08.251
...they have a tendency
to hop on a bandwagon...

41:08.418 --> 41:10.253
...before they see who's driving it.

41:10.837 --> 41:13.715
But when they wise up,
and believe me, they will...

41:13.882 --> 41:16.635
...what matters is
that you'll be there for them.

41:16.802 --> 41:19.096
Leading by example just like always.

41:19.262 --> 41:22.265
Truth, justice and the American way.

41:22.724 --> 41:25.727
It ain't broke, so don't fix it.

41:25.977 --> 41:27.270
Thanks, Pa.

41:27.437 --> 41:31.066
Besides, if those knuckleheads
don't quit tugging on your cape...

41:31.233 --> 41:34.945
...you can always kick
their self-righteous asses to kingdom come.

41:40.283 --> 41:42.452
Lois?
- Home now.

42:01.346 --> 42:02.806
Let's get out of here!

42:15.485 --> 42:17.320
That's not attractive at all.

42:17.487 --> 42:19.156
Finally someone you wouldn't do.

42:19.322 --> 42:20.657
Zip it, love birds.

42:20.824 --> 42:24.327
Let's show Big Blue how it's done
on his home turf.

42:28.999 --> 42:31.293
I hope you know
that thing goes off during dinner.

42:31.460 --> 42:33.462
Yeah, yeah.

42:33.628 --> 42:36.006
Dad, that's Central Square.

42:36.173 --> 42:38.592
- The Elite are here.
- Terrence, wait.

42:40.385 --> 42:42.012
Aren't you an ugly biter?

42:42.179 --> 42:44.014
He's sending in the B team?

42:44.181 --> 42:46.475
I want the boss, not the interns.

43:01.865 --> 43:03.867
Let him go!

43:31.645 --> 43:33.730
Black. Shield up.

43:49.371 --> 43:53.792
I really have to sober up now.
What the hell is happening?

43:57.462 --> 44:00.340
I think that little rest at Stryker's
did me some good.

44:52.517 --> 44:53.977
Hat, form a perimeter.

45:23.298 --> 45:26.009
Coldcast, can you absorb energy
or just project it?

45:26.176 --> 45:29.220
Hells yes. If I can get that sucker
before he gets me.

45:29.512 --> 45:31.514
Oi. You can't boss my team.

45:57.499 --> 46:00.377
The man giveth and the man taketh away.

46:20.146 --> 46:21.690
You're buggered, mate.

46:21.856 --> 46:23.400
Give my regards to Satan then.

46:23.566 --> 46:26.528
No. He's going back to Stryker's.

46:26.695 --> 46:29.072
Back to jail? Are you daft?

46:29.239 --> 46:32.909
This is what happens.
More pain, more suffering.

46:33.076 --> 46:36.663
- We are not the law. We do not...
- Kill him.

46:39.666 --> 46:42.752
- Kill him.
- I'm sorry.

46:52.762 --> 46:54.222
- Do it, Manchester.
- Kill it.

46:54.389 --> 46:55.432
- Kill it.
- Kill it.

46:55.598 --> 46:56.599
- Kill it.
- Do it.

46:56.766 --> 46:58.101
Stop, listen to Superman.

46:58.268 --> 46:59.602
- Do it.
- Kill the bastard.

47:00.437 --> 47:02.105
He... He wouldn't want...

47:02.272 --> 47:04.941
It's your fault. You beat him already.

47:05.108 --> 47:07.902
- You did it your way and...
- And he failed.

47:08.069 --> 47:09.446
Is that the world you want?

47:09.612 --> 47:12.699
Or should monsters like this
get what they deserve?

47:13.908 --> 47:14.951
Say it, kid.

47:16.119 --> 47:17.620
No.

47:19.456 --> 47:20.498
Do it.

47:58.745 --> 48:00.789
Listen, I like Superman, sure.

48:00.955 --> 48:05.335
But the Elite will kill these murderers
and terrorists. What's not to like?

48:05.502 --> 48:07.295
The Elite are terrorists.

48:07.462 --> 48:09.339
They have allied themselves with Bialya.

48:09.506 --> 48:12.175
And perpetrated acts of war
against our nation.

48:12.342 --> 48:14.511
This will not be tolerated.

48:14.677 --> 48:17.013
I've lived in Metropolis my entire life.

48:17.180 --> 48:19.349
Superman has always been there for us.

48:19.516 --> 48:23.478
But so have those criminals
he's put away so many times.

48:23.645 --> 48:25.855
Maybe his way doesn't work.

48:26.022 --> 48:28.608
Acts of aggression
will no longer be tolerated.

48:28.775 --> 48:31.152
And not a Superman
nor a Manchester Black...

48:31.319 --> 48:33.780
...will stop us from defending
our borders.

48:33.947 --> 48:36.074
Kill them all and let God sort it out.

48:36.241 --> 48:39.369
Superman's done.
This is the age of the Elite.

48:53.716 --> 48:56.886
It's not fair. Someone else be Superman.

48:57.053 --> 49:00.056
- Not it.
- But you wanted to be Superman.

49:00.223 --> 49:03.560
Yeah, but I can't kill you,
but you can kill me? That's not fair.

49:03.726 --> 49:07.897
- It's the rules.
- Sucks. Superman is so beat.

49:39.429 --> 49:43.266
<i>Clark. Clark. I called Kansas
and Ma said you're not there.</i>

49:43.433 --> 49:47.103
<i>So pick up your stupid hologram thing
or I'll kick your butt when you get home.</i>

49:50.106 --> 49:52.692
- Sweet-talker.
- Yeah, <i>well,</i> not really.

49:52.859 --> 49:54.944
<i>I made it through those files on the Elite.</i>

49:55.111 --> 49:57.238
<i>Mr. Black's back-story
is a load of rubbish.</i>

49:57.405 --> 50:00.450
<i>Failing to mention his sister
is still alive is a good example.</i>

50:00.617 --> 50:03.077
<i>And that dear old Dad
suffered a massive stroke...</i>

50:03.244 --> 50:05.955
<i>...when Chester decided
he was due for one.</i>

50:06.122 --> 50:09.876
<i>And how Vera's rescue resulted
in the deaths of a dozen people...</i>

50:10.043 --> 50:12.045
<i>...when he crushed the train that hit her.</i>

50:12.212 --> 50:14.339
My God, are you running this
in the <i>Planet?</i>

50:14.505 --> 50:15.798
<i>I tried.</i>

50:15.965 --> 50:19.802
<i>Perry was shut down by British Intelligence
before the story left his computer.</i>

50:19.969 --> 50:23.097
<i>No one wants to admit
they took a narcissistic angry teenager...</i>

50:23.264 --> 50:25.266
<i>...and tried to make a Superman
out of him.</i>

50:25.433 --> 50:27.268
<i>The rest of the team isn't much better.</i>

50:27.435 --> 50:30.480
<i>No murders, but criminal records
a mile long.</i>

50:30.647 --> 50:32.565
<i>All wiped clean
when they were recruited.</i>

50:35.610 --> 50:36.861
Vera's a sweet kid...

50:37.028 --> 50:39.614
...but she turned into quite
the establishment bitch, didn't she?

50:39.781 --> 50:41.991
Sorry to barge in, but there was no bell.

50:42.158 --> 50:45.078
And magic trumps a giant key every time.

50:50.083 --> 50:51.834
I'm going to say this once.

50:52.001 --> 50:55.463
Surrender now,
face judgment for your crimes or...

50:55.630 --> 50:59.008
Stop. There is no "or"
in this conversation.

50:59.175 --> 51:03.179
Because you don't have the stones to do
to us what we'd do to you in a heartbeat.

51:03.346 --> 51:06.683
He might have the stones to do me.

51:06.849 --> 51:10.979
Pam, I'm handing out ultimatums.
Please, keep it in your pants.

51:13.815 --> 51:17.819
You probably won't believe this,
but I used to love superheroes.

51:17.986 --> 51:20.780
But masks are for hiding.
Capes are for play.

51:20.947 --> 51:23.324
You were the first. The best.

51:23.992 --> 51:27.912
But now you're a clichÃ©
and you don't fit in anymore.

51:28.079 --> 51:33.626
Mad scientists, idiots in underwear, bank
robbers, knock yourself out with that lot.

51:33.793 --> 51:37.714
But the real work, fixing the world,
is ours.

51:38.172 --> 51:40.133
Starting tomorrow with Bialya.

51:40.300 --> 51:43.886
- I'm shutting you down.
- Right.

51:47.056 --> 51:50.310
<i>Maybe this time they'll learn
that crime doesn't pay.</i>

51:57.025 --> 51:59.110
<i>Entering Pokolistan airspace.</i>

51:59.277 --> 52:01.779
<i>Capital city in range.</i>

52:04.490 --> 52:07.744
<i>Requesting authorization
for payload drop.</i>

52:09.287 --> 52:13.541
<i>All buildings are active targets.
Level the city.</i>

52:22.717 --> 52:24.594
<i>Long live Bialya.</i>

53:36.666 --> 53:38.626
It ends today.

53:38.793 --> 53:42.755
Ends without a single loss of life.

53:43.673 --> 53:46.175
Boy, you sure showed us, didn't you?

53:47.969 --> 53:52.140
Do I feel mortified?
What happens next, Super Gandhi?

53:59.063 --> 54:02.191
Next I get the leaders of both
Pokolistan and Bialya...

54:02.358 --> 54:05.194
...to sit down
and talk in a neutral location.

54:05.361 --> 54:09.615
- Don't you think it's a bit late for that?
- It's never too late for peace, Black.

54:09.782 --> 54:11.868
That's what I'm trying
to make you understand.

54:12.034 --> 54:14.704
No. No, I mean, it's a bit late...

54:14.871 --> 54:17.206
...because the leaders of Bialya
and Pokolistan...

54:17.373 --> 54:20.543
- ...are dead as a bunch of dead wankers.
- What?

54:20.710 --> 54:22.879
<i>Well, you know, the opposite of alive.</i>

54:23.713 --> 54:25.214
<i>Dead.</i>

54:37.852 --> 54:39.645
No one was gonna blink here, Supes.

54:39.812 --> 54:40.980
I read their minds.

54:41.147 --> 54:43.733
Got all their precious little state secrets.

54:43.900 --> 54:47.153
Bottom line is that the war of jackholes
was just going to escalate...

54:47.320 --> 54:50.531
...until this dungheap of a region
was turned to glass.

54:50.698 --> 54:53.868
- No offense.
- No. You didn't.

54:54.035 --> 54:57.914
The only logical thing to do was to
slot the whole megillah and start over.

54:58.080 --> 54:59.916
So congratulations, children.

55:00.082 --> 55:03.920
Your leaders are all dead.
Peace reigns supreme.

55:04.378 --> 55:05.755
No!

55:15.181 --> 55:16.766
Oh, no.

55:29.070 --> 55:30.530
Wait.

55:34.283 --> 55:37.620
In a week people will forget
these countries ever existed.

55:37.787 --> 55:41.624
But they'll never forget the day Superman
declared war on their favorite son.

55:43.543 --> 55:49.924
Write your wills, say your goodbyes.
Tomorrow it's done.

55:56.097 --> 55:57.723
<i>While the international community...</i>

55:57.890 --> 55:59.559
<i>...has condemned the actions
of the Elite...</i>

55:59.725 --> 56:03.646
<i>public polls indicate that many feel the
conflict between Bialya and Pokolistan...</i>

56:03.813 --> 56:05.898
<i>...has been definitively resolved.</i>

56:06.065 --> 56:09.402
<i>However, with Superman
next on the Elite's list, the question is...</i>

56:09.569 --> 56:11.362
Turn it off, please.

56:13.114 --> 56:15.491
- When?
- Dawn, I guess.

56:15.658 --> 56:17.493
They'll like the drama of that.

56:17.660 --> 56:20.580
Why do you have to do this?
Why can't you call someone else?

56:20.746 --> 56:22.999
The Elite didn't take the fight
to anyone else.

56:23.332 --> 56:26.627
- They chose me.
- No, you went after them.

56:26.794 --> 56:29.672
They're slaughtering people
and laughing about it.

56:29.839 --> 56:32.800
Black can punch a hole
through a mountain by thinking.

56:32.967 --> 56:36.012
The Hat tosses around demons
like trained birds and Pam...

56:36.178 --> 56:39.807
- They have to be stopped.
- I think they can beat you.

56:42.059 --> 56:45.396
I'm sorry.
But they're willing to go places you won't.

56:45.855 --> 56:48.232
And they are so damn strong.

56:52.862 --> 56:56.240
I heard a child say that he wanted
to be in the Elite when he grows up...

56:56.407 --> 56:59.410
...because it would be fun
to kill bad guys.

56:59.577 --> 57:01.495
Fun to kill.

57:01.662 --> 57:03.706
People have to know
that there's another way.

57:03.873 --> 57:07.460
They have to see that someone
believes in humanity strongly enough to...

57:07.627 --> 57:09.795
To die for them?

57:23.559 --> 57:24.727
Clark?

57:47.249 --> 57:49.251
Show yourselves.

58:06.394 --> 58:10.189
Pretty flash entrance, isn't it?
Our Bunny's a keeper.

58:12.441 --> 58:14.443
Some people have no sense of theater.

58:14.610 --> 58:16.487
- I call kneecaps.
- Spine.

58:16.654 --> 58:19.448
- Other.
- Wait. Not here.

58:23.577 --> 58:25.121
Please.

58:25.287 --> 58:27.748
A last request. Brilliant.

58:27.915 --> 58:30.292
We'll patch the game through
to interested parties.

58:30.459 --> 58:32.628
Want everyone to see
it's a fair fight, yes?

58:34.630 --> 58:37.842
Crackers. Bunny, darling.

58:44.640 --> 58:47.059
Damn you, Clark.

58:53.274 --> 58:56.152
Here's a nice slice of pitch to play on.

58:56.318 --> 59:00.781
Thank Bunny for the oxygen.
Not that you need it, but we mere mortals...

59:00.948 --> 59:03.492
Figure you got a speech prepped.

59:03.659 --> 59:05.619
I've tried to reason with you.

59:05.786 --> 59:07.913
<i>I've tried to show you
there's another way.</i>

59:08.080 --> 59:12.001
<i>I'm begging you to help me end this
without further bloodshed.</i>

59:12.168 --> 59:15.087
<i>Stand down
and be judged for your crimes.</i>

59:15.254 --> 59:17.923
<i>And maybe we can all get out of this
in one piece.</i>

59:21.635 --> 59:24.263
You're an inconceivable wanker.

59:30.644 --> 59:34.190
<i>Pay attention, would-be superheroes,
and glorious people of Earth.</i>

59:34.356 --> 59:35.775
<i>School's in session.</i>

59:35.941 --> 59:40.488
<i>And Professor Chester's gonna learn you
how the world will work from this day on.</i>

59:41.530 --> 59:46.786
<i>he who has the power
makes the rules. Obvious.</i>

59:46.952 --> 59:50.873
<i>tough love is a crock of scatters.</i>

59:52.708 --> 59:54.376
<i>This isn't about love</i>

59:54.543 --> 59:58.130
<i>People don't want babysitters in spandex
to spank them when they're bad.</i>

59:58.297 --> 01:00:01.217
<i>They want surgeons to cut out the cancers
that festered in us...</i>

01:00:01.383 --> 01:00:03.886
<i>...and make sure they never come back.</i>

01:00:09.725 --> 01:00:12.520
<i>Dr. Black, at your service.</i>

01:00:46.762 --> 01:00:48.097
Wait for it, kids.

01:00:50.558 --> 01:00:53.102
<i>Rule number three: no more capes.</i>

01:00:53.269 --> 01:00:57.106
<i>As this ends quicker than any of you
ever imagined, take heed.</i>

01:00:57.273 --> 01:00:58.774
<i>Blue Boy is the first.</i>

01:00:58.941 --> 01:01:03.112
<i>But if any of his costumed cronies rise up
to avenge their fallen dream...</i>

01:01:03.279 --> 01:01:07.783
<i>you'll get worse, I promise.
The dream is over.</i>

01:01:08.576 --> 01:01:10.870
Viva reality.

01:01:17.459 --> 01:01:21.463
No witty retort? Oh, wait.
You're in the middle of a seizure.

01:01:21.630 --> 01:01:23.382
Sorry, mate. I can't read your mind...

01:01:23.549 --> 01:01:25.968
...but I sure as hell
can muck about with your brain.

01:01:28.804 --> 01:01:31.640
All those capillaries,
like little tubes of concrete.

01:01:31.807 --> 01:01:33.809
But still vulnerable.

01:01:40.482 --> 01:01:41.525
It's funny, isn't it?

01:01:41.692 --> 01:01:45.988
A life of truth, justice and
the American, military, capitalist way.

01:01:46.155 --> 01:01:49.408
In the end, you die on the moon,
wondering if your bowels will let go.

01:01:49.575 --> 01:01:52.745
And tomorrow, the world will go on
like nothing happened.

01:01:52.912 --> 01:01:56.165
Dragged kicking and screaming
to a better day.

01:01:58.626 --> 01:02:00.169
Ta, mate.

01:02:20.898 --> 01:02:23.317
- They didn't really...
- I mean, it's Superman.

01:02:23.484 --> 01:02:26.320
There, look.

01:02:29.865 --> 01:02:32.409
How is it that no matter
how badly you massacre...

01:02:32.576 --> 01:02:34.536
...one of these thong-and-blanket types...

01:02:34.703 --> 01:02:38.624
...some shred of their unmentionables
still survives the blast?

01:02:39.291 --> 01:02:42.711
I did my best, boss.
At least you got a trophy out of it.

01:02:43.295 --> 01:02:44.797
Strewth.

01:02:54.139 --> 01:02:58.394
Right, who else has business to perform
on this shroud before we hang it up?

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:02.022
- I, for one, should like to scrub my...
- I finally get it.

01:03:02.523 --> 01:03:04.233
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:06.235
No frigging way.

01:03:06.402 --> 01:03:08.570
Cool it, Hat. Coldcast?

01:03:08.737 --> 01:03:12.700
Nothing could have...
That was like 15 suns exploding in his face.

01:03:13.242 --> 01:03:17.246
I made the mistake
of treating you people like people.

01:03:17.413 --> 01:03:20.749
No sonar.
Can't smell him either. Scorched air.

01:03:20.916 --> 01:03:23.836
But now I understand better.

01:03:24.003 --> 01:03:26.380
I'm getting a tight sphincter here,
Chester.

01:03:26.547 --> 01:03:27.798
Shut your gob.

01:03:27.965 --> 01:03:31.427
I understand now what the world wants.

01:03:31.593 --> 01:03:33.095
What it needs.

01:03:33.262 --> 01:03:35.264
Ow! Something bit me.

01:03:36.432 --> 01:03:38.642
- Bit you?
- Pam!

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:47.609
- Do something.
- Do what?

01:03:47.776 --> 01:03:49.778
He's poisoned the zoo.
The buggers want out.

01:03:49.945 --> 01:03:52.281
He is supposed to be dead.

01:03:56.118 --> 01:03:59.621
- She's not breathing. Damn it, Chester.
- She's dead?

01:03:59.788 --> 01:04:02.416
Bugger me. He's playing it our way.

01:04:02.583 --> 01:04:05.961
Leave her.
Blister the land and flush him out.

01:04:06.128 --> 01:04:10.424
I can't. Not after a blast like that.
Call the ship and get Pam to sick bay.

01:04:10.591 --> 01:04:12.259
Guys.

01:04:12.426 --> 01:04:14.636
The world needs people in charge...

01:04:14.803 --> 01:04:18.098
...who are willing
to put the animals down.

01:04:20.142 --> 01:04:23.520
- Is...? Is that Superman?
- Not anymore.

01:04:28.901 --> 01:04:31.987
- Pam!
- She's dead. Let her go.

01:04:32.154 --> 01:04:35.199
Hang tight. Everyone knows
Superman can't do magic.

01:04:35.365 --> 01:04:37.951
Don't let him separate us.

01:04:39.078 --> 01:04:41.789
Here's a little ancient Chinese secret.

01:04:44.166 --> 01:04:46.335
How? He's shielded by magic.

01:04:46.502 --> 01:04:48.837
That wind is clocking in
at 500 miles a minute.

01:04:49.004 --> 01:04:50.798
His body may not be taking any hits...

01:04:50.964 --> 01:04:53.675
...but his lungs just collapsed
from the vacuum.

01:04:56.178 --> 01:04:59.306
Do something.
Find his brain and shut it down.

01:04:59.473 --> 01:05:00.682
He thought this through.

01:05:00.849 --> 01:05:05.062
- He's been playing us this whole time.
- Chester. He killed Pam and the Hat.

01:05:05.229 --> 01:05:06.355
Get With it.

01:05:07.022 --> 01:05:09.900
Bunny, get us out of here.

01:05:12.694 --> 01:05:15.030
What the hell are you doing?
Pam is still up there.

01:05:15.197 --> 01:05:17.199
- We can't just...
- He won't do anything here.

01:05:17.366 --> 01:05:18.951
Not with the sheep around us.

01:05:28.544 --> 01:05:30.003
Bunny, get ready to port again.

01:05:30.170 --> 01:05:33.715
The second he shows his S,
I'm gonna flatten this whole city.

01:05:33.882 --> 01:05:35.759
Chester, wait.

01:05:37.886 --> 01:05:39.388
Holy sh...

01:05:44.268 --> 01:05:46.728
Where did he go?
Where did he freaking go?

01:05:46.895 --> 01:05:51.066
Orbit. He went into orbit at Mach seven.

01:05:55.362 --> 01:06:00.951
If you had super-hearing,
any second you'd hear the pop.

01:06:07.583 --> 01:06:09.001
Oh, no.

01:06:09.168 --> 01:06:13.338
You crazy son of a bitch.
You killed my team.

01:06:14.590 --> 01:06:17.217
Your team of killers.

01:06:21.096 --> 01:06:22.556
Now guess what.

01:06:23.515 --> 01:06:25.601
They won't be killing anyone else.

01:06:31.857 --> 01:06:33.150
See?

01:06:33.317 --> 01:06:37.237
I finally bought what you've been selling.

01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:13.774
You bloody psychopath!

01:07:16.568 --> 01:07:18.487
How does it feel, Black?

01:07:21.490 --> 01:07:24.409
How does it feel to be deconstructed?

01:07:24.576 --> 01:07:28.288
To be the victim?
To watch your dreams die?

01:07:31.166 --> 01:07:34.002
Let me show you,
you self-righteous hypocrite.

01:07:48.976 --> 01:07:52.604
Heat vision? You can barely stand,
let alone fry my face.

01:07:52.771 --> 01:07:54.856
I'm not aiming at your face.

01:08:05.867 --> 01:08:07.703
You're not dying. I'm thinking it...

01:08:07.869 --> 01:08:10.497
...but why can't I feel my power?

01:08:10.664 --> 01:08:15.210
I scanned your brain for abnormalities.
And when I found one...

01:08:15.377 --> 01:08:18.212
...I out it out.

01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:19.923
- What?
- Heat vision.

01:08:20.090 --> 01:08:22.216
Focused through your pupils
like a scalpel.

01:08:22.384 --> 01:08:24.720
Instant lobotomy.

01:08:39.484 --> 01:08:42.446
This isn't you. You don't do this.

01:08:43.738 --> 01:08:45.573
I do now.

01:08:46.283 --> 01:08:47.326
No!

01:08:47.492 --> 01:08:49.411
<i>It doesn't have to be that way, Superman.</i>

01:08:49.578 --> 01:08:51.412
<i>You taught us that.</i>

01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:55.082
No. He taught you that he's no better
than the rest of us.

01:08:55.584 --> 01:08:58.252
You all saw. Everyone on Earth
saw what you did to us.

01:08:58.420 --> 01:09:02.674
<i>And they know you're no better.
There's nothing special about you.</i>

01:09:11.725 --> 01:09:13.435
<i>Yes, they did see.</i>

01:09:13.602 --> 01:09:17.104
They saw the ugliness of violence
as a solution and it frightened them.

01:09:17.272 --> 01:09:21.443
It frightened me too when I decided
to cross that line and do what you do.

01:09:21.609 --> 01:09:22.986
It's so easy.

01:09:23.153 --> 01:09:25.113
Anger, vengeance.

01:09:31.953 --> 01:09:34.413
Luckily, I'm not you.

01:09:34.581 --> 01:09:36.166
And I never will be.

01:09:38.210 --> 01:09:41.630
You killed my team! Look at this place!

01:09:41.796 --> 01:09:42.798
Chester.

01:09:42.964 --> 01:09:45.591
I thought you were supposed to be
the sharp one.

01:09:45.759 --> 01:09:47.301
Boys.

01:09:59.815 --> 01:10:03.151
- Hell of a performance.
- To be fair, I had some help.

01:10:03.318 --> 01:10:04.653
Your sister, to start.

01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:06.321
Her files were very thorough.

01:10:06.488 --> 01:10:09.116
Especially regarding
the idiosyncrasies of your brain.

01:10:09.282 --> 01:10:12.869
But I knew they wouldn't be enough.
You're right about me.

01:10:13.036 --> 01:10:15.622
I would never put civilians in harm's way.

01:10:17.165 --> 01:10:19.000
<i>I Won '1' kill.</i>

01:10:19.543 --> 01:10:21.336
<i>But you would.</i>

01:10:22.295 --> 01:10:24.297
So <i>I made sure I had backup</i>

01:10:24.464 --> 01:10:25.632
<i>As for your people...</i>

01:10:26.007 --> 01:10:27.092
<i>...they're fine.</i>

01:10:27.259 --> 01:10:29.594
<i>Nursing headaches
I don't even wanna think about.</i>

01:10:29.761 --> 01:10:32.431
<i>But very much alive
as they're stripped of their powers...</i>

01:10:32.597 --> 01:10:35.684
<i>...and prepped for transport
to a supermax prison.</i>

01:10:36.476 --> 01:10:39.354
That's why I had to let you
knock me around for so long.

01:10:39.521 --> 01:10:41.356
I didn't have a nifty teleporter.

01:10:42.524 --> 01:10:44.651
Bunny, you rotten clot, get me out of...

01:10:44.818 --> 01:10:46.111
But I do now.

01:10:46.736 --> 01:10:49.281
You'd be surprised how fast
Bunny agreed to help me...

01:10:49.448 --> 01:10:53.994
...when one of the super-bots promised
to return her to her home dimension.

01:10:55.996 --> 01:11:00.375
You...? You think that's it?
It's not over, you poncy twit.

01:11:00.542 --> 01:11:05.672
If you think I'll just go to jail and rot,
you're living in a dream world!

01:11:05.839 --> 01:11:08.383
Good. Dreams save us.

01:11:08.550 --> 01:11:12.137
Dreams lift us up and transform us
into something better.

01:11:12.304 --> 01:11:15.724
And on my soul,
I swear that until my dream...

01:11:15.891 --> 01:11:20.479
...of a world where dignity, honor
and justice are the reality we all share...

01:11:20.645 --> 01:11:23.815
...I'll never stop fighting. Ever.

01:11:41.041 --> 01:11:45.712
Olsen, get the crowd reactions.
Perry loves crowds.

01:11:46.630 --> 01:11:49.549
You ever scare me like that again,
I'll kill you.

01:11:49.716 --> 01:11:52.886
If I ever scare me like that again,
it's a deal.

01:11:53.053 --> 01:11:55.972
Can we go so I can kiss you now?
