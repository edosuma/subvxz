WEBVTT

00:08.808 --> 00:10.775
Ah, nothing.

00:10.810 --> 00:12.812
Well, so far,
it doesn't smell like a trap.

00:12.847 --> 00:14.814
Maybe this kid's
actually on the level.

00:15.215 --> 00:17.182
I can't blame
him for being careful.

00:17.217 --> 00:19.219
Considering how ashlocke
treats his friends,

00:19.619 --> 00:21.586
i don't even want to know
what he'd do to a defector.

00:21.621 --> 00:24.023
Well, before you bring out
your violin, let's just remember

00:24.058 --> 00:26.426
that nobody actually forced
the links to give themselves

00:26.461 --> 00:28.028
over to ashlocke.

00:28.063 --> 00:29.594
Really?

00:29.629 --> 00:31.631
Sure about that?

00:32.031 --> 00:33.633
Well, you know,
i'm just saying let's...

00:34.034 --> 00:36.036
just make sure that this guy
really wants to break free of

00:36.071 --> 00:38.438
this sociopath before
we let our guard down.

00:38.473 --> 00:39.656
Okay?

00:39.691 --> 00:40.840
Stop!

00:41.241 --> 00:43.643
Stay where i can see you!

00:51.651 --> 00:53.653
Sure you weren't followed?

00:53.688 --> 00:55.655
No, it's just us.

00:55.690 --> 00:58.823
What's up?

00:58.858 --> 01:00.460
I thought you said
there were more people want
to get away from ashlocke.

01:00.860 --> 01:02.427
Yeah, there were ten of us.

01:02.462 --> 01:04.063
Ashlocke got the others
before they could escape.

01:04.464 --> 01:06.031
I... i barely made it out.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.068
Like, i don't know what
he's going to do to them.

01:08.103 --> 01:10.035
You gotta help them get out.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.072
Well, yeah, but we need
to know a bit more first.

01:12.107 --> 01:13.638
Look, i don't
know what happened.

01:13.673 --> 01:15.675
It used to be about all of
us working together, you know?

01:15.710 --> 01:17.277
Now, it's just
all about gabriel.

01:18.878 --> 01:22.482
Look,
gabriel is really sick, but
he's still strong, all right?

01:22.517 --> 01:24.084
He's planning
something really big.

01:24.119 --> 01:25.685
He calls it his last testament.

01:25.720 --> 01:27.252
I don't know what it is.

01:27.287 --> 01:29.689
But whatever
it is, it scares me.

01:29.724 --> 01:32.092
Well, we should
get you out of here.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.893
Ah... ah... ah...!

01:33.928 --> 01:35.695
Ah... ah... ah...!

01:37.297 --> 01:38.098
Hey. You okay?

01:38.498 --> 01:39.699
Yeah. Take it...
take this. Help them.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.102
Ah... agh... no...

01:42.137 --> 01:43.703
ashlocke, no!

01:43.738 --> 01:45.670
Agh.

01:45.705 --> 01:47.707
You tried to
steal me from gabriel.

01:47.742 --> 01:50.110
That was a stupid mistake.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.074

02:04.124 --> 02:05.725
Ashlocke's got him!

02:05.760 --> 02:06.891
Josh, don't!

02:06.926 --> 02:09.729
I don't want to hurt you!

02:10.930 --> 02:12.932
I knew you'd be the one to come.

02:12.967 --> 02:14.934
You just can't
stay away, can you?

02:14.969 --> 02:16.901
The links are mine.

02:16.936 --> 02:20.140
You think you
can break us apart?

02:20.175 --> 02:22.107
Oh, i forgot.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.144
You don't like
fire, do you, shalimar?

02:24.544 --> 02:25.745
Well, think fast.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.948
I have big plans for you.

02:30.950 --> 02:34.154
Ah!

02:36.956 --> 02:38.558
Jess, bring it in!

02:38.593 --> 02:40.160
Shal's in trouble.

02:43.363 --> 02:44.964
Ah... uh...!

02:45.365 --> 02:46.966
Hah...!

02:56.176 --> 02:56.976
Come on! We gotta get out!

02:57.377 --> 02:58.143
No! We can't!

02:58.178 --> 02:59.379
We gotta go! Come on!

02:59.779 --> 03:00.945
You don't have a choice!

03:00.980 --> 03:02.982
This thing's about to explode!

04:21.127 --> 04:24.731
We've built something here
the world has never seen before.

04:24.766 --> 04:32.956
We have a power
that never existed before.

04:32.991 --> 04:41.147
Love, devotion, and
a loyalty to our own kind,

04:41.182 --> 04:48.354
that society
couldn't even dream of.

04:48.389 --> 04:51.122
You're the chosen ones.

04:51.157 --> 04:54.160
You're the ones that are going
to reach out there and grab

04:54.195 --> 04:57.163
the destiny that was built
inside your genetic structure.

04:57.198 --> 05:01.132
Because the ones
that are running it now,

05:01.167 --> 05:05.972
well, they're only about
greed and votes and weakness.

05:06.007 --> 05:09.593
But we're going
to change all that.

05:09.628 --> 05:13.179
Because it's our
turn in the big chair.

05:13.579 --> 05:15.981
No more running and hiding.

05:16.016 --> 05:18.384
We're the main attraction.

05:18.419 --> 05:20.752
Top of the bill.

05:20.787 --> 05:23.589
Because we can make miracles
happen, the kind of miracles

05:23.990 --> 05:26.792
that make people
want to stand up and cheer.

05:26.827 --> 05:29.595
The kind of miracles
that will keep down anybody

05:29.630 --> 05:33.564
that stands up against us.

05:33.599 --> 05:36.803
What's coming
next is going to take all
your strength and courage.

05:37.203 --> 05:40.371
So get ready boys and girls.

05:40.406 --> 05:47.213
One way or another,
destiny is only a breath away.

05:49.615 --> 05:50.817
Kid didn't have chance, adam.

05:51.217 --> 05:52.383
Ashlocke knew he'd be there.

05:52.418 --> 05:53.985
He wanted us to
see what he could do.

05:54.020 --> 05:56.022
You know, as his control over
the links has grown stronger

05:56.422 --> 05:58.825
over the last few weeks, i think
his madness has grown with it.

05:58.860 --> 06:00.391
I don't know.

06:00.426 --> 06:02.428
The kid was talking about
something ashlocke was planning,

06:02.829 --> 06:04.831
something called
his last testament.

06:04.866 --> 06:06.833
Yeah?

06:07.233 --> 06:09.200
Well, according
to my projections,

06:09.235 --> 06:11.237
he doesn't have time left
to accomplish much of anything.

06:11.272 --> 06:12.403
Well, good.

06:12.438 --> 06:14.040
Maybe i can get
this guy out of my head.

06:14.440 --> 06:15.606
He keeps toying with me.

06:15.641 --> 06:17.643
Well, because, once
he tunes into your mind,

06:17.678 --> 06:19.262
tough to get him out.

06:19.297 --> 06:20.812
Yeah, no kidding.

06:20.847 --> 06:22.849
Well, i'm hoping that as his
physical condition degenerates

06:22.884 --> 06:25.216
his psychic abilities
will weaken too.

06:25.251 --> 06:27.653
Yeah, well, ashlocke's not going
to let himself just fade away.

06:28.054 --> 06:29.220
Right.

06:29.255 --> 06:30.857
But, you know, trying
to guess his next move is like,

06:30.892 --> 06:32.859
phew, you know,
chasing our own tail.

06:33.259 --> 06:35.661
I think what we have to
do is we have to concentrate on

06:35.696 --> 06:38.064
saving the links and the
other new mutants that we can.

06:38.099 --> 06:39.230
Yeah?

06:39.265 --> 06:40.867
How are we going to do that?

06:41.267 --> 06:43.269
Wait for ashlocke to call and
tell us where they're hiding?

06:43.304 --> 06:44.871
Well, we may
not have to do that.

06:45.271 --> 06:46.873
The kid slipped this to me.

06:47.273 --> 06:49.640
The meow club.

06:49.675 --> 06:51.242
I remember that place.

06:51.277 --> 06:52.879
My parents used
to go dancing there.

06:52.914 --> 06:55.681
Maybe it's under new management.

06:57.283 --> 06:58.884
What do you think?

06:58.919 --> 07:00.486
I still got it?

07:00.521 --> 07:02.053
Yeah.

07:02.088 --> 07:03.654
You were brilliant.

07:03.689 --> 07:07.693
Yeah, well, truth is
like a fresh drink of water.

07:07.728 --> 07:09.260
Uh huh.

07:09.295 --> 07:15.301
You are going to
play a very important role
in our destiny, patricia.

07:15.336 --> 07:16.920
Me?

07:16.955 --> 07:18.504
Hmm.

07:18.905 --> 07:22.108
We're in our final
days and we can't be apart.

07:22.143 --> 07:26.913
The links can't be alone again.

07:26.948 --> 07:29.715
What are you saying?

07:30.116 --> 07:34.120
You're the only one that
can help fulfil this destiny.

07:34.520 --> 07:39.325
If i go, everyone
has to come with me.

07:39.360 --> 07:42.493
You mean kill them?

07:42.528 --> 07:44.931
Go out in one
bright, beautiful flame.

07:44.966 --> 07:47.698
All of us.

07:47.733 --> 07:50.136
Gabriel, i can't do it.

07:50.536 --> 07:54.140
<sighs> i hate it
when people say no to me.

07:54.175 --> 07:59.345
Tell me you will
fulfil our destiny.

08:06.953 --> 08:10.156
I will.

08:10.556 --> 08:13.324
It'll be our little secret.

08:13.359 --> 08:16.162
You can keep
a secret, can't you?

08:33.379 --> 08:36.147
Did you miss me?

08:36.182 --> 08:39.184
That's okay, you
don't have to answer.

08:39.220 --> 08:42.188
I'm not here for
conversation this time.

08:57.403 --> 09:00.606
Thank you, shalimar.

09:01.007 --> 09:03.409
I feel so close to you.

09:07.813 --> 09:10.216
What's going on?

09:10.616 --> 09:13.384
<gasp> oh, god...

09:13.419 --> 09:19.025
<panting> he was here again.

09:19.060 --> 09:20.226
Honey, i...

09:20.626 --> 09:22.228
i don't see anything.

09:22.628 --> 09:25.031
Yeah, well, i didn't see him
either, but i know he was here.

09:25.066 --> 09:27.798
Isn't there
something you can do?

09:27.833 --> 09:30.236
I mean, there must be
something you can do to keep

09:30.636 --> 09:32.203
him out of my head.

09:32.238 --> 09:34.640
He can get to you, but
ultimately it's your mind.

09:35.041 --> 09:37.843
You can fight him.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.646
You just have to stay on guard.

09:40.681 --> 09:43.414
Ha! That's great.

09:43.449 --> 09:45.851
All right, shalimar, emma.

09:45.886 --> 09:47.418
Time to go.

09:47.453 --> 09:49.020
Remember, stealth
is the key word.

09:49.055 --> 09:51.457
You gotta get in and out
without setting off any alarms.

09:51.857 --> 09:54.660
And shalimar, the mission
is to save the links,

09:55.061 --> 09:57.428
not to take out ashlocke.

09:57.463 --> 09:59.865
Look, adam, i know you feel
some kind of responsibility for

09:59.900 --> 10:02.268
that maniac, but your
dog is rabid, and it's your

10:02.668 --> 10:04.270
responsibility to put him down
and maybe your conscience has

10:04.670 --> 10:09.075
a problem with
it, but i assure you my
conscience is fine with it.

10:20.686 --> 10:22.688
Ah... i love a fast
dip in shalimar's mind.

10:23.089 --> 10:28.694
Her rage is always
so... stimulating.

10:32.298 --> 10:35.100
Not now, kimmy.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.868
We're on the move.

10:37.903 --> 10:40.706
Everybody's going a-visiting.

10:49.515 --> 10:51.717
None of the plans here
could be a whole lot of help.

10:51.752 --> 10:53.919
I've got no idea what kind
of alarms ashlocke's put in.

10:53.954 --> 10:55.886
<laughing> alarms
are the easy part.

10:55.921 --> 10:57.523
Getting the links
out of there in one piece,

10:57.558 --> 10:59.925
that's going to be the trick.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.293
You okay?

11:02.328 --> 11:03.929
You're the one
that can read minds.

11:03.964 --> 11:06.297
You tell me.

11:06.332 --> 11:09.100
You were pretty
hard on adam back there.

11:09.135 --> 11:11.537
Well, ashlocke's
not pulling any punches and
we can't afford to either.

11:11.572 --> 11:14.740
Don't confuse adam's
compassion for weakness.

11:14.775 --> 11:16.759
Well, i judge
people by their actions.

11:16.794 --> 11:18.709
And adam, as far
as ashlocke's concerned?

11:18.744 --> 11:21.547
I don't know which way
he's going to jump sometimes.

11:21.582 --> 11:23.114
All right, guys.

11:23.149 --> 11:25.151
Target in half a click.

11:27.953 --> 11:29.955
Video shows ashlocke
has stepped up security
from his previous hideouts.

11:29.990 --> 11:32.758
It's a barred gate
with a security post,

11:33.159 --> 11:35.961
two links on the roof, more
in the front, more in the back.

11:35.996 --> 11:38.764
Getting in undetected is looking
harder by the minute, huh?

11:38.799 --> 11:41.784
Taking her down.

11:41.819 --> 11:44.770
Go to stealth mode.

11:52.378 --> 11:53.544
All right.

11:53.579 --> 11:54.780
We'll introduce
ourselves to the guards.

11:54.815 --> 11:55.981
You take care
of the alarm system.

11:56.016 --> 11:59.985
All right.

12:07.993 --> 12:09.995
Agghh!

12:52.438 --> 12:53.639
You all right?

12:53.674 --> 12:56.842
Let's go.

12:58.043 --> 12:59.245
The alarm system's off up front.

12:59.645 --> 13:00.846
Does anybody
know what's going on?

13:00.881 --> 13:04.450
I do.

13:05.251 --> 13:07.218
Ugh...!

13:07.253 --> 13:08.454
Oh, hey, buddy, you okay?

13:08.489 --> 13:09.272
Yeah.

13:09.307 --> 13:10.020
Yeah?

13:10.055 --> 13:11.257
Wrong answer.

13:11.292 --> 13:12.057
Ah...

13:12.458 --> 13:14.460
uh...

13:30.075 --> 13:34.079
well, if you were
ashlocke, where would you
hide your rebel mutants?

13:34.114 --> 13:37.900
Something's wrong.

13:37.935 --> 13:41.212
We were expected.

13:41.247 --> 13:44.490
Oh, it's a trap.

13:44.525 --> 13:46.492
No kidding.

13:55.301 --> 13:56.066
All right, guys.

13:56.101 --> 13:57.302
Come on, check this out.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.504
We don't have to do this.

13:58.539 --> 13:59.670
Ashlocke is crazy.

13:59.705 --> 14:02.908
He doesn't care about you guys.

14:04.109 --> 14:05.676
No!

14:05.711 --> 14:08.113
My shield will slow down
the electrons of anything that

14:08.148 --> 14:10.115
tries to pass through it.

14:10.150 --> 14:12.735
But not for long.

14:12.770 --> 14:15.286
Uh, c'mon jess.

14:15.321 --> 14:16.922
How about a little help, huh?

14:16.957 --> 14:18.541
Emergency exit.

14:18.576 --> 14:20.125
Coming right up.

14:22.127 --> 14:24.129
Let's go.

14:31.337 --> 14:34.139
Let's go.

14:36.141 --> 14:38.143
Ashlocke's planning something
that's going to hurt people.

14:38.544 --> 14:41.747
I can't stay for it.

14:54.960 --> 14:56.962
Come on, get in.

15:02.968 --> 15:04.970
Hang on.

15:16.982 --> 15:18.984
Adam, we're on our way back.

15:19.019 --> 15:20.551
Adam?

15:20.586 --> 15:22.187
Comlink's must
not be getting through.

15:23.389 --> 15:25.391
Adam. It's brennan.
We're on our way back.

15:25.426 --> 15:27.393
It was a trap.
Ashlocke was ready for us.

15:27.428 --> 15:29.360
So sorry.

15:29.395 --> 15:32.563
Adam's busy right now.

15:32.598 --> 15:37.403
But you can leave
a message after the beep.

15:39.004 --> 15:40.170
Beeeep.

15:40.205 --> 15:43.008
He's in sanctuary.

15:51.884 --> 15:53.886
How the hell did ashlocke
get into sanctuary?

15:53.921 --> 15:55.487
He shouldn't even
be able to find it.

15:55.522 --> 15:56.689
So much for impregnable.

15:57.089 --> 15:57.890
No, ashlocke is powerful, man.

15:58.290 --> 15:59.456
He's not that powerful.

15:59.491 --> 16:01.058
He had to have
had the access codes.

16:01.093 --> 16:02.660
Yeah, well, with ashlocke,
nothing's impossible.

16:02.695 --> 16:04.296
He could be listening
to us right now for all we know.

16:04.697 --> 16:05.462
I'd know.

16:05.497 --> 16:07.064
No, you wouldn't know.

16:07.099 --> 16:09.066
He's been one step
ahead of us the whole time.

16:09.101 --> 16:10.668
Adam should've taken
him out when he had the chance,

16:10.703 --> 16:12.304
but he didn't want to go there,
and now look where it's gotten.

16:12.339 --> 16:13.505
He's probably dead already.

16:13.906 --> 16:15.072
No.

16:15.107 --> 16:16.709
If ashlocke wanted adam dead, he
would've been dead right away.

16:16.744 --> 16:17.910
He wants something else?

16:18.310 --> 16:19.476
Yeah, like what?

16:19.511 --> 16:21.914
Well, that's what
we're going to find out.

16:21.949 --> 16:23.881
What do you want?

16:23.916 --> 16:25.717
Always right to the point.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.436
What's the matter, adam?

16:27.471 --> 16:29.121
No time for small talk?

16:29.156 --> 16:31.340
I guess not.

16:31.375 --> 16:33.490
Ah, that's okay.

16:33.525 --> 16:36.328
I don't have much time to waste.

16:36.363 --> 16:39.131
Neither of us do.

16:41.133 --> 16:43.901
Kimmy, i want you to meet adam.

16:43.936 --> 16:47.139
He's the one who we
have to thank for everything.

16:47.174 --> 16:50.159
He's the man
who made us who we are.

16:50.194 --> 16:53.145
He kept me in
a pod most of my life.

16:53.545 --> 16:59.551
In all those years,
my mind was fully alert.

16:59.586 --> 17:03.155
It was like being buried alive.

17:03.555 --> 17:05.958
And now that i'm out, i want
to keep on living, and i need

17:05.992 --> 17:11.163
you to help me do that.

17:19.570 --> 17:20.772
Alright, i'm coming in.

17:20.808 --> 17:22.791
Hangar door open.

17:22.827 --> 17:24.777
We got a problem.

17:25.176 --> 17:26.779
Hangar door's not responding.

17:26.814 --> 17:29.799
Override it.

17:29.834 --> 17:32.785
Nothing.

17:35.988 --> 17:37.589
You know, brennan,
if it's not opening,

17:37.624 --> 17:38.791
you might want to slow down.

17:38.826 --> 17:39.992
I'm trying.

17:40.392 --> 17:42.394
Sanctuary's defense
shield jammed our controls.

17:42.429 --> 17:43.595
Switch into full manual.

17:43.996 --> 17:44.762
Come on.

17:44.797 --> 17:47.599
Any time now,
brennan, would be good.

17:47.634 --> 17:49.601
Go!

17:50.002 --> 17:54.006
Ugh!

17:54.406 --> 17:57.809
Well, i guess we
should've expected that.

17:57.844 --> 18:01.213
We're going to have
to find another way in.

18:01.248 --> 18:03.032
Yeah, i wouldn't count on it.

18:03.067 --> 18:04.782
Adam designed that system.

18:04.817 --> 18:06.819
If ashlocke's in charge
of security now, we're screwed.

18:06.854 --> 18:09.621
Gabriel's in
there, we can't go in.

18:10.022 --> 18:12.424
He'll kill all of us.

18:12.825 --> 18:15.627
Well, on that cheery note,
i'm going to land this puppy and

18:15.662 --> 18:18.030
see if i can fix
her guidance system.

18:26.038 --> 18:28.040
They're out there but
nothing's getting in or out

18:28.075 --> 18:32.444
unless you want it to.

18:32.845 --> 18:34.847
I always wondered if
we'd get this chance to talk,

18:35.247 --> 18:37.214
just the two of us.

18:37.249 --> 18:38.851
Without your freaks interfering.

18:38.886 --> 18:40.052
They're not freaks.

18:40.087 --> 18:41.218
I know.

18:41.253 --> 18:42.654
I know i am.

18:42.689 --> 18:44.056
I'm the freak.

18:44.456 --> 18:46.258
And i'm proud of it.

18:46.293 --> 18:48.025
You made me like this.

18:48.060 --> 18:51.263
You amuse yourself, don't you?

18:51.298 --> 18:54.083
Hmm.

18:54.118 --> 18:56.869
Stop it.

18:57.269 --> 19:00.472
All you had to do was ask.

19:00.507 --> 19:03.675
See, i'm not such a bad guy.

19:03.710 --> 19:05.277
Ha.

19:05.677 --> 19:07.679
Tell that to all
the people that you killed,

19:07.714 --> 19:09.281
like the link
at the oil refinery.

19:09.681 --> 19:11.248
That was your fault.

19:11.283 --> 19:14.887
He was mine,
and your people trying to
steal him got him killed.

19:14.922 --> 19:18.508
Don't forget it.

19:18.543 --> 19:22.094
Don't touch that!

19:30.102 --> 19:33.305
Guys, we're getting a live video
feed from inside sanctuary.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.672
Well, let's bring that up.

19:35.707 --> 19:38.911
I can't do what
you want, gabriel.

19:38.946 --> 19:42.932
I can't keep you alive.

19:42.967 --> 19:46.919
You can't or you won't?

19:46.954 --> 19:48.921
Both.

19:49.321 --> 19:51.923
You did this to me.

19:51.958 --> 19:54.526
You made me like this.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.493
What?

19:56.528 --> 19:58.530
Now you're just
going to let me die?

19:58.931 --> 20:00.532
What kind of monster are you?

20:00.933 --> 20:02.935
Can't help.

20:02.970 --> 20:04.902
Really?

20:04.937 --> 20:06.538
I'll tell you what, why
don't we play a little game?

20:06.573 --> 20:08.140
Why don't we see just
how big of a monster you are?

20:08.540 --> 20:09.706
I'm not playing any games.

20:09.741 --> 20:12.109
It's a very
important game, adam.

20:12.144 --> 20:16.148
The lives of, say, oh,
ten million people depend on it.

20:16.183 --> 20:21.753
Events triggered by
my death will end all life

20:22.154 --> 20:24.957
within fifty miles of downtown.

20:30.162 --> 20:33.365
There, now we'll see
if you'll play the game.

20:33.400 --> 20:36.168
<sighs> all right.

20:36.568 --> 20:38.135
Fine.

20:38.170 --> 20:41.373
All you had to do was ask.

20:41.408 --> 20:42.940
Gabriel.

20:42.975 --> 20:47.779
He's got a video feed
coming out of this room.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.167
That was stupid, adam.

21:10.202 --> 21:11.803
You do something like
that again the city won't have

21:12.204 --> 21:13.370
to wait for my death.

21:13.405 --> 21:15.372
I will wipe them
out in a heartbeat.

21:15.407 --> 21:17.009
You want me to create
something to stabilize
your genetic system,

21:17.409 --> 21:22.214
you give me a blood sample.

21:22.614 --> 21:27.419
Get to work, adam.

21:44.636 --> 21:46.638
Hey, what's ashlocke
talking about?

21:47.039 --> 21:48.205
I don't know.

21:48.240 --> 21:49.806
You can't lie to me.

21:49.841 --> 21:51.843
You know how he's planning
to kill all those people.

21:52.244 --> 21:53.810
I don't know anything.

21:53.845 --> 21:56.247
Gabriel doesn't
want to hurt anyone.

21:56.282 --> 21:58.650
He just doesn't
want us to be alone.

21:58.685 --> 21:59.816
Hey, emma.

21:59.851 --> 22:02.254
Let me talk to you for a sec.

22:02.654 --> 22:05.457
Listen, whatever ashlocke
is planning is back in the city,

22:05.492 --> 22:07.276
so you and shal
take patricia back.

22:07.311 --> 22:09.061
Get her to open
up and take you to it.

22:09.096 --> 22:10.262
Okay.

22:10.662 --> 22:11.828
What about you guys?

22:11.863 --> 22:16.268
Oh, jesse and me are
going to break into a mountain.

22:23.475 --> 22:25.077
Huh.

22:25.477 --> 22:28.280
It gonna take a big
bandage to cover that one.

22:28.315 --> 22:33.485
It's going to be okay, isn't it?

22:33.520 --> 22:37.706
It's taken care of.

22:37.741 --> 22:41.419
Adam will fix it.

22:41.454 --> 22:45.097
He has no choice.

22:45.132 --> 22:46.698
Good.

22:47.099 --> 22:52.304
Because... because i love you.

22:52.339 --> 22:54.306
I mean, we all do.

22:54.706 --> 22:57.509
But, especially me.

22:57.544 --> 23:01.113
I know.

23:03.515 --> 23:07.519
<panting> this is what
i get for cutting aerobics
from the workout, huh?

23:07.554 --> 23:09.086
Yeah.

23:09.121 --> 23:10.722
Well, the hard
part's yet to come.

23:11.123 --> 23:12.324
Thanks for mentioning that.

23:12.724 --> 23:14.326
What do you think?

23:14.361 --> 23:16.293
I don't know.

23:16.328 --> 23:19.531
The way i remember it,
it's only eight inches thick.

23:19.931 --> 23:21.533
Shouldn't be a problem.

23:21.933 --> 23:25.937
I'll just get in
and phase you through.

23:25.972 --> 23:29.541
All right.

23:31.543 --> 23:35.547
Whew...

23:35.582 --> 23:39.551
agghhh...!

23:42.187 --> 23:43.388
Oof!

23:43.789 --> 23:45.355
Hey, you okay?

23:45.390 --> 23:46.992
Ugh, adam planned for that.

23:47.027 --> 23:48.558
Agh!

23:48.593 --> 23:50.996
Well, so much
for the gentle approach.

23:51.031 --> 23:53.398
Look out, dude.

24:00.205 --> 24:03.008
Not even a scratch.

24:03.408 --> 24:05.810
When adam said the
sanctuary was impregnable,

24:05.845 --> 24:08.213
i didn't think he
meant impregnable from us.

24:08.248 --> 24:11.416
Can you make it through there?

24:11.817 --> 24:13.383
Oh, i don't know.

24:13.418 --> 24:16.221
Eight inches
of door is one thing,

24:16.256 --> 24:19.790
but twenty feet of solid rock?

24:19.825 --> 24:23.028
I run out of steam halfway
through, i'm a fossil.

24:23.428 --> 24:25.430
Well, considering
what ashlocke's planning,

24:25.465 --> 24:28.633
it might be a better option.

24:55.460 --> 24:57.662
So that's all i
have to look forward to,

24:57.697 --> 24:59.865
thanks to you and
the good folks at genomex.

25:00.265 --> 25:02.232
I'm going to fix you.

25:02.267 --> 25:05.270
Each of the last five attempts
have improved in stability.

25:05.305 --> 25:08.273
Right now they're experiencing
a little snapback effect.

25:08.308 --> 25:10.675
You can't afford too
many more failures, adam.

25:11.076 --> 25:13.879
Ha, hell, even dr. Frankenstein
had a better track record.

25:13.914 --> 25:17.082
I'm doing the best i can.

25:18.683 --> 25:24.254
Emma, can you sense anything?

25:24.289 --> 25:27.492
I'm not getting impressions from
anyone except the two of you.

25:27.527 --> 25:29.860
They're gone.

25:29.895 --> 25:32.297
So what about the others,
do you know where they went?

25:32.332 --> 25:34.917
We moved when gabriel told us.

25:34.952 --> 25:37.467
Nobody knew where we were going.

25:37.502 --> 25:40.705
Look, he's planning
on wiping out an entire city.

25:41.106 --> 25:43.708
He doesn't want us to be alone.

25:43.743 --> 25:46.311
So if he dies, everybody dies?

25:46.346 --> 25:47.930
He loves us.

25:47.965 --> 25:49.479
No, he doesn't.

25:49.514 --> 25:51.116
All he's offering
you and the others is death.

25:51.151 --> 25:53.518
It's not like that.

25:53.553 --> 25:55.085
It is.

25:55.120 --> 25:56.721
That's why you
ran away from him.

25:56.756 --> 25:57.923
I just don't want...

25:57.958 --> 25:59.489
what?

25:59.524 --> 26:03.528
Look, patricia, if you
help us then we can help you.

26:07.532 --> 26:09.900
<sighs>

26:09.935 --> 26:13.538
your precious mutant x,
what happens when their

26:13.573 --> 26:15.540
genes start spinning
out of control?

26:15.575 --> 26:17.943
Have you even told them that?

26:17.978 --> 26:19.910
Of course not.

26:19.945 --> 26:22.312
Hey, keep playing god, adam.

26:22.347 --> 26:24.749
It's only their
lives on the line.

26:24.784 --> 26:26.716
I was trying to save lives.

26:26.751 --> 26:29.154
Gene technology seemed to
be the way to make that happen.

26:29.554 --> 26:30.755
Oh, please.

26:31.156 --> 26:33.558
Gene tech was just the
latest toy all the scientists

26:33.593 --> 26:35.525
were dreaming about.

26:35.560 --> 26:38.162
You were years ahead of the
rest of the world, and you got

26:38.197 --> 26:41.283
drunk on all the things you
thought you could do with it.

26:41.318 --> 26:44.369
You didn't even think about
the crimes you were committing.

26:44.404 --> 26:46.336
I was a doctor.

26:46.371 --> 26:47.973
I was concerned about
the suffering i saw every day

26:48.008 --> 26:50.340
- ms, aids, heart
disease, diabetes.

26:50.375 --> 26:53.578
Not using gene technology
to try to help people
would've been the crime.

26:53.613 --> 26:56.381
And look, i'm very sorry
for what happened to you.

26:56.781 --> 27:00.350
I truly am.

27:00.385 --> 27:03.188
But i've worked for
years to try to make it right.

27:03.223 --> 27:06.791
You don't have
years any more, adam.

27:06.826 --> 27:11.596
You've got hours.

27:21.206 --> 27:23.208
Yeah, but it'd be just
like him to put a back door

27:23.243 --> 27:24.809
in the security codes, huh?

27:24.844 --> 27:26.376
Hmm.

27:26.411 --> 27:28.813
I've a feeling this
is about more than just
breaking into sanctuary.

27:28.848 --> 27:30.815
I think you want to
beat adam's unbeatable system.

27:30.850 --> 27:31.982
Yeah, why not?

27:32.017 --> 27:33.618
It might make
him notice me, huh?

27:34.019 --> 27:35.185
What are you talking about, man?

27:35.220 --> 27:36.821
You've been in everybody's
face since the get-go.

27:36.856 --> 27:38.840
I meant make him
notice i've changed.

27:38.875 --> 27:40.790
I'm not the same
kid he took pity on.

27:40.825 --> 27:42.627
Well, i hate to say it,
but i don't think adam's the one

27:42.662 --> 27:44.429
who's got questions about
you being grown up, jesse.

27:44.464 --> 27:45.630
What are you saying?

27:46.031 --> 27:47.232
I'm saying you're
thinking too much.

27:47.632 --> 27:49.634
Come on, you've proven yourself
twenty times over at least.

27:49.669 --> 27:51.636
Now, if you want adam to think
you're an adult or a leader

27:51.671 --> 27:53.603
- i don't know, a space
alien... whatever it is,

27:53.638 --> 27:55.605
you're the one who's got
to feel comfortable with it,

27:55.640 --> 27:57.642
because once you're comfortable
with it everybody else
will accept it.

27:57.677 --> 28:00.045
It all comes pretty
easy for you, huh?

28:00.080 --> 28:01.611
Huh, yeah, right.

28:01.646 --> 28:03.213
You should've
seen me ten years ago.

28:03.248 --> 28:05.250
I almost electrocuted anybody
got within twenty feet of me.

28:05.285 --> 28:06.816
You think you're screwed up?

28:06.851 --> 28:08.053
I didn't even
know what species i was.

28:11.656 --> 28:12.857
Upstairs is clean.

28:13.258 --> 28:14.824
Nothing downstairs either.

28:14.859 --> 28:16.861
Well, whatever weapon
ashlocke's planning on using,

28:16.896 --> 28:18.463
it's not here.

28:18.863 --> 28:22.067
Patricia, you
trust us, don't you?

28:22.102 --> 28:24.034
Yeah.

28:24.069 --> 28:26.471
Then why won't you help us?

28:26.506 --> 28:29.291
Gabriel wouldn't want it.

28:29.326 --> 28:32.077
Don't think about gabriel.

28:32.112 --> 28:33.495
He saved us.

28:33.530 --> 28:34.879
I owe him.

28:35.280 --> 28:36.446
You don't owe him anything.

28:36.481 --> 28:38.448
Let us help
you and your friends.

28:38.483 --> 28:40.485
Look, i don't know
what gabriel's planning.

28:40.885 --> 28:42.887
All i know is that i
have to get far away from here.

28:42.922 --> 28:47.692
Would you help me?

28:52.097 --> 28:56.501
If this doesn't work,
are you still planning
to destroy the city?

28:56.536 --> 28:58.103
I didn't ask for this, adam.

28:58.138 --> 29:01.123
The power.

29:01.158 --> 29:04.074
The sickness.

29:04.109 --> 29:06.911
I never gave up on you.

29:06.946 --> 29:09.679
I'm sure you didn't.

29:09.714 --> 29:12.517
You knew what i was like and...

29:12.552 --> 29:15.285
and still you tried to help me.

29:15.320 --> 29:21.291
If the situations had been
reversed, i'd have killed you.

29:21.326 --> 29:34.539
You know, i always
sort of thought of you
as my real father, adam.

29:34.574 --> 29:38.143
You know, it doesn't
have to be like this, gabriel.

29:38.543 --> 29:40.945
If this procedure
works you can do anything,

29:41.346 --> 29:44.549
you can go anywhere
you want to go.

29:44.584 --> 29:47.352
Second chance.

29:47.752 --> 29:51.321
I like the sounds of that.

29:51.356 --> 29:59.364
Can you give me
a second chance, adam?

30:04.169 --> 30:11.741
It's holding.

30:11.776 --> 30:14.179
How long to synthesize
enough for a treatment?

30:14.214 --> 30:16.181
Not long.

30:16.581 --> 30:18.583
Good.

30:18.983 --> 30:22.587
Because it's exactly
how long i have to live.

30:37.402 --> 30:38.603
Patricia's mine.

30:39.003 --> 30:41.806
You won't change that.

30:41.841 --> 30:43.425
Emma.

30:43.460 --> 30:44.974
I know.

30:45.009 --> 30:46.211
I sense him.

30:46.611 --> 30:48.578
Concentrate.

30:48.613 --> 30:53.017
You can force him out.

30:53.418 --> 30:58.188
No!

30:58.223 --> 31:03.793
Leave her alone.

31:03.828 --> 31:06.631
You guys just
don't get it, do you?

31:07.031 --> 31:13.838
Here you are trying to figure
out my plan, and here she is,

31:13.873 --> 31:16.606
right underneath your noses.

31:16.641 --> 31:19.844
Patricia's powers don't
just slow down electrons,

31:19.879 --> 31:23.848
they also excite them, too.

31:23.883 --> 31:25.850
What do you mean?

31:26.251 --> 31:29.053
Oh, i can't tell you everything.

31:33.458 --> 31:34.659
You don't have to do this.

31:35.059 --> 31:37.862
Yes, i do.

32:20.371 --> 32:21.772
Let me get this straight.

32:21.807 --> 32:23.174
She's ashlocke's plan?

32:24.375 --> 32:25.976
And we let her slip
right through our fingers.

32:26.011 --> 32:27.578
That's why she wanted
to get away so badly,

32:27.613 --> 32:29.180
so he couldn't call on her.

32:29.580 --> 32:31.147
Well, the next question is:

32:31.182 --> 32:32.784
What is ashlocke
calling on her to do?

32:33.184 --> 32:36.387
I don't know,
but he said it involved her
ability to excite electrons.

32:36.422 --> 32:38.354
What, like an amplifier?

32:38.389 --> 32:40.792
I guess, but i don't see how
that can threaten a whole city?

32:40.827 --> 32:42.759
Look, it could if she
had access to a power plant.

32:42.794 --> 32:46.397
She'd turn every
toaster, tv set and computer
in the city into a bomb.

32:46.798 --> 32:50.401
We'll find the
nearest substation.

32:50.802 --> 32:52.804
We'll contact you there.

33:27.238 --> 33:29.640
Hey, it's from sanctuary.

33:29.675 --> 33:30.842
What, adam?

33:31.242 --> 33:32.408
I don't know.

33:32.443 --> 33:34.445
Let me try something.

33:34.480 --> 33:35.611
There.

33:35.646 --> 33:36.848
You see this electronic beacon?

33:37.248 --> 33:38.815
Yeah.

33:38.850 --> 33:41.252
Watch what happens
when i superimpose a
map of the original caves.

33:41.287 --> 33:44.455
That fissure extends almost
to the inside wall of sanctuary.

33:44.856 --> 33:46.858
Adam's given us an invitation.

33:46.893 --> 33:48.059
Well, let's rsvp.

33:48.459 --> 33:50.862
Yeah.

33:53.664 --> 33:57.268
<panting> when
will it be finished?

33:57.668 --> 33:58.835
Try to relax.

33:58.870 --> 34:00.837
It's almost there.

34:00.872 --> 34:04.075
I'll relax when my body stops
trying to tear itself apart.

34:09.679 --> 34:12.447
Oh.

34:12.483 --> 34:17.288
Well, can't say that
in my short time back i haven't

34:17.322 --> 34:22.310
experienced all the emotions.

34:22.344 --> 34:27.263
Love, hate, anger, and now fear.

34:27.297 --> 34:32.103
I gotta admit, i could have
taken a pass on the last one.

34:32.138 --> 34:34.906
We're all afraid of dying.

34:35.306 --> 34:37.708
It's how we deal with
it that defines who we are.

34:37.743 --> 34:40.110
Don't give me philosophy!

34:40.146 --> 34:47.717
Give me what i need.

34:58.930 --> 35:02.533
Gabriel, i don't
want to do this.

35:02.568 --> 35:06.537
You don't have a choice.

35:07.738 --> 35:09.305
There.

35:09.340 --> 35:11.342
Adam set the marker
behind these rocks over here.

35:11.377 --> 35:12.944
You know, if he
put it in the wrong place,

35:12.979 --> 35:14.545
we might not make it through.

35:14.946 --> 35:16.948
Come on, jesse,
it's not even an option.

35:16.983 --> 35:19.367
Open it up.

35:19.402 --> 35:21.752
All right.

35:24.555 --> 35:25.756
You okay?

35:25.791 --> 35:26.923
Yeah.

35:26.958 --> 35:27.758
It's good to be home.

35:28.159 --> 35:30.161
Come on.

35:35.766 --> 35:37.368
She's here.

35:37.403 --> 35:38.970
I can feel her.

35:39.005 --> 35:40.972
Come on.

35:41.772 --> 35:42.939
Lie down.

35:42.974 --> 35:45.376
I'll give you the anesthetic.

35:45.411 --> 35:46.978
No anesthetic.

35:47.378 --> 35:49.980
The effects could be painful.

35:50.015 --> 35:52.548
I need to keep my faculties.

35:52.583 --> 35:54.986
If your procedure
doesn't do what it promises,

35:55.386 --> 35:58.589
i have a city to kill.

36:05.796 --> 36:08.199
It's time to go, baby.

36:08.599 --> 36:11.802
In case it doesn't happen...

36:20.611 --> 36:23.414
go ahead, it's going to be okay.

36:39.030 --> 36:43.834
Patricia! Patricia!
Patricia, no!

36:43.869 --> 36:45.801
Stay back.

36:45.836 --> 36:48.239
I'm fulfilling our destiny.

37:04.622 --> 37:07.390
What are you waiting for?

37:07.425 --> 37:09.026
How do i know
that i can trust you?

37:09.061 --> 37:11.028
You don't.

37:11.429 --> 37:14.232
If i live, the city lives.

37:14.632 --> 37:17.835
You can trust me.

37:18.636 --> 37:20.203
Adam.

37:20.238 --> 37:21.439
Let him go.

37:21.839 --> 37:24.242
Easy, boys.
I'm still in this game.

37:24.642 --> 37:26.644
Agghh... agghh!

37:26.679 --> 37:27.845
Do it.

37:28.246 --> 37:29.412
Agghh...

37:29.447 --> 37:31.449
do it now. Do it!

37:31.484 --> 37:34.252
Agh...!

37:53.471 --> 37:55.072
Patricia, you've
got to shut him out.

37:55.473 --> 37:56.639
I can't!

37:56.674 --> 37:58.241
Yes, you can.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.278
He's in my head,
too, but i'm fighting him.

38:00.313 --> 38:01.844
He's in our minds
because he loves us.

38:01.879 --> 38:03.881
He gets into your
head to make you do things

38:03.916 --> 38:06.101
that you don't want to do.

38:06.136 --> 38:08.286
That's not love, that's rape.

38:13.891 --> 38:15.092
Come on, i'm fighting him.

38:15.127 --> 38:18.696
You can, too.

38:37.515 --> 38:41.083
Oh, that certainly feels better.

38:41.118 --> 38:43.120
You don't have
to kill all those people.

38:43.155 --> 38:45.139
You don't want that.

38:45.174 --> 38:47.124
He's too strong.

38:47.525 --> 38:49.527
No, he has you and the others
thinking he's some kind of god,

38:49.562 --> 38:51.093
but he's not.

38:51.128 --> 38:53.931
He's an infection.

38:56.334 --> 39:01.539
Congratulations, adam.

39:01.574 --> 39:06.709
I feel like a new mutant.

39:06.744 --> 39:11.949
And as a reward,
i'll kill you last.

39:11.984 --> 39:12.715
No, no!

39:12.750 --> 39:14.151
It's all right.

39:14.186 --> 39:15.518
Don't bother.

39:15.553 --> 39:17.154
You won't be killing anybody.

39:17.189 --> 39:18.721
No?

39:18.756 --> 39:20.758
You can't be naive
enough to think that...

39:20.793 --> 39:22.325
that you can trust me?

39:22.360 --> 39:24.762
No, but you were naive enough
to believe that i'd actually

39:24.797 --> 39:29.784
allow you to go on killing.

39:29.819 --> 39:33.496
The serum, -it never worked.

39:33.531 --> 39:37.174
<panting> no, i saw the results.

39:37.209 --> 39:39.176
You thought you did.

39:39.211 --> 39:43.581
Trust me.

39:49.186 --> 39:51.188
<panting> i still
feel him inside my head.

39:51.589 --> 39:52.790
He's haunting me.

39:53.190 --> 39:54.392
You know what i'm talking about.

39:54.427 --> 39:56.394
You feel it, too.

39:56.794 --> 39:59.196
Now, patricia.

39:59.231 --> 40:01.564
Do it now.

40:01.599 --> 40:04.001
Think about your
friends, patricia.

40:04.036 --> 40:07.570
Don't let them die.

40:07.605 --> 40:15.212
<panting> do it, patricia!

40:16.414 --> 40:18.816
I'm sorry, gabriel.

40:21.218 --> 40:22.420
All right, now, now, now!

40:22.455 --> 40:27.224
Where... aggghhh!

40:36.033 --> 40:38.035
Brennan, we got her.

40:44.041 --> 40:46.844
It's over.

40:48.846 --> 40:50.813
It must've been hard for you.

40:50.848 --> 40:52.815
We knew how you
felt about ashlocke.

40:52.850 --> 40:55.252
Yeah, well,
you know, i really did try
to help him over the years.

40:55.287 --> 40:57.254
In the end, i just
didn't have a choice.

40:57.655 --> 41:01.258
Well, i gotta tell you, it feels
pretty good knowing i'm the

41:01.293 --> 41:03.260
only one left inside my head.

41:03.661 --> 41:06.028
Huh, well, it
may be good for you,

41:06.063 --> 41:08.065
but it worries
the rest of us, though...

41:08.100 --> 41:11.268
<laughing> so, how's patricia?

41:11.303 --> 41:14.036
She's in pain.

41:14.071 --> 41:16.474
I think she loved
him right 'til the end.

41:16.509 --> 41:18.841
What about the links, adam?

41:18.876 --> 41:20.843
What's going
to happen to them, now?

41:20.878 --> 41:23.280
Well, hopefully, some of them
will drift into normal lives.

41:23.315 --> 41:25.683
You know, i'm just afraid that
a lot of them are going to be

41:25.718 --> 41:28.085
infected by his influence.

41:28.486 --> 41:30.287
Now, there's a lovely thought.

41:30.322 --> 41:32.089
Well, let's not kid ourselves.

41:32.490 --> 41:34.492
I don't think we've
seen the end of his legacy,

41:34.527 --> 41:38.496
not by a long shot.

41:46.504 --> 41:49.707
Perfect. I'll take it.

41:50.107 --> 41:52.475
Is this a gift, ma'am?

41:52.510 --> 41:58.516
No, it's for me, for my baby.
