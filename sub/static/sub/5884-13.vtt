00:00.755 --> 00:03.008
Previously on AMC's Mad Men...

00:03.823 --> 00:05.471
You stay away from her!
You hear me?

00:05.784 --> 00:07.720
Don, are you ever gonna call back
the American Cancer Society?

00:08.031 --> 00:09.609
They've tried you twice this morning.

00:10.816 --> 00:12.624
I'm not gonna run out of
here crying tomorrow.

00:18.903 --> 00:19.711
She's gone.

00:20.904 --> 00:21.727
I know.

00:22.063 --> 00:23.391
I think it's time for us to move.

00:23.720 --> 00:28.304
Meet me for dinner, in the open,
wherever I want, because...

00:28.968 --> 00:30.247
We can do that now.

01:13.713 --> 01:14.779
Hello?

01:18.551 --> 01:21.152
I still have to pack
for a 7:00 A.M. flight

01:21.220 --> 01:22.854
thanks to you.

01:28.361 --> 01:30.295
Will you at least put me out
of my misery before you go?

01:30.363 --> 01:33.298
Stop it. American Cancer loved the letter

01:33.366 --> 01:35.033
and they're gonna love you.

01:35.101 --> 01:38.269
And then you're gonna stop working,

01:38.337 --> 01:41.239
take your kids to
California and have a ball.

01:42.908 --> 01:45.443
I have this sick feeling
in the pit of my stomach.

01:49.849 --> 01:54.152
Listen, maybe it's not all about work.

01:55.988 --> 01:59.591
Maybe that sick feeling might go away

01:59.658 --> 02:01.393
if you take your head out of the sand about

02:02.695 --> 02:04.462
the past.

02:05.798 --> 02:07.265
You know it's not that simple.

02:07.333 --> 02:09.133
Of course it isn't,

02:09.201 --> 02:11.636
and you don't have to do it alone.

02:13.139 --> 02:14.839
But if you resolve some of that,

02:14.907 --> 02:17.409
you might be more comfortable
with everything.

02:17.476 --> 02:20.045
And then what happens?

02:20.112 --> 02:23.748
And then you're stuck trying to
be a person like the rest of us.

02:37.063 --> 02:40.065
I'll call you Tuesday when you get back.

02:46.539 --> 02:48.740
I'm gonna miss you, you know.

03:10.896 --> 03:15.300
- Any outgoing?
- Just... This.

03:15.367 --> 03:18.069
Don't post it. It's for you.

03:18.137 --> 03:20.505
It's been discussed among the partners

03:20.573 --> 03:22.107
that you be promoted

03:22.174 --> 03:24.642
to Director of Agency Operations.

03:25.978 --> 03:27.445
My goodness.

03:27.513 --> 03:29.914
Now it's a dreadful reality

03:29.982 --> 03:33.184
that we've not signed
any new business in 10 weeks,

03:33.252 --> 03:35.620
so I hope you'll understand

03:35.688 --> 03:39.958
that this is a title only... For now.

03:40.025 --> 03:42.994
Well, it's almost an honor.

03:49.435 --> 03:52.403
What made you suddenly write that?

03:56.809 --> 04:00.445
Well, most of it was
in the letter, hopefully.

04:01.981 --> 04:05.817
But I think in my heart it was an impulse,

04:05.885 --> 04:08.353
because I knew what I needed
to do to move forward.

04:08.420 --> 04:11.589
Well, it was a gesture
we hope will be useful.

04:11.657 --> 04:14.659
We believe, obviously, that
lung cancer is avoidable

04:14.727 --> 04:17.529
and can be thwarted
with the right campaign.

04:17.596 --> 04:21.565
- But how?
- We know frightening medical facts are useless.

04:21.634 --> 04:25.103
- Half of us are smokers.
- I'm a smoker too.

04:25.171 --> 04:28.606
And you can forget about us.
I've worked $10 million campaigns

04:28.674 --> 04:30.508
that can't even get
people to change brands.

04:30.576 --> 04:32.310
I can tell you from the inside

04:32.378 --> 04:35.046
that the business is really
only about getting new smokers.

04:35.114 --> 04:36.948
Teenagers are a tough sell.

04:37.016 --> 04:39.517
Not to tobacco companies.

04:39.585 --> 04:41.386
They play on a two-pronged attack,

04:41.453 --> 04:43.621
promising adulthood and rebellion.

04:43.689 --> 04:47.492
But teenagers are sentimental as well.

04:47.560 --> 04:49.327
Have you heard their music?

04:51.864 --> 04:54.165
I can tell you a little
of what I have in mind.

04:54.233 --> 04:56.868
I have to say it's very interesting.

04:56.936 --> 04:58.670
Go on.

05:02.675 --> 05:05.243
What I'm suggesting
is a series of commercials

05:05.311 --> 05:06.978
that run during "Bandstand" and the like.

05:07.046 --> 05:10.448
Show mothers and daughters
or fathers and sons

05:10.516 --> 05:13.585
and that cigarettes are between them.

05:13.652 --> 05:17.422
And you show with a walk on the beach,

05:17.489 --> 05:19.857
baking cookies, playing catch,

05:19.925 --> 05:22.860
that the parents are
not long for this world.

05:22.928 --> 05:24.562
But they hate their parents.

05:24.630 --> 05:26.731
They won't be thinking about their parents.

05:26.799 --> 05:28.366
They'll be thinking about themselves.

05:28.434 --> 05:30.301
That's what they do.

05:31.870 --> 05:33.371
The truth is

05:34.807 --> 05:36.541
they're mourning for their childhood

05:36.609 --> 05:39.844
more than they're
anticipating their future,

05:39.912 --> 05:42.080
because they don't know it yet
but they don't want to die.

05:45.651 --> 05:48.620
If it helps, I can guarantee you
that Lucky Strike will hate this.

05:55.361 --> 05:57.428
- How'd it go?
- So did you get Cancer?

05:59.298 --> 06:01.032
Megan, can you get Mr. Cosgrove?

06:02.534 --> 06:04.235
We've got a meeting for another meeting.

06:04.303 --> 06:05.937
They were eating out of his hand.

06:09.875 --> 06:11.509
And even better, the board was loaded

06:11.577 --> 06:13.778
with fat cats just like you said.

06:13.846 --> 06:16.781
Don had a particularly empathic exchange

06:16.849 --> 06:18.383
with the C.E.O. of Dow chemical.

06:18.450 --> 06:20.618
Saran wrap would be nice.

06:20.686 --> 06:22.553
I'll take him out on the
links, let him beat me.

06:22.621 --> 06:25.156
Roger, this is a
philanthropic organization.

06:25.224 --> 06:26.958
Don and I think it best if
we approach from the rear.

06:28.927 --> 06:31.529
- Are we celebrating?
- Don got us to the top three.

06:31.597 --> 06:33.765
- Stupendous.
- Ken, sit down.

06:41.073 --> 06:44.075
Everett Marlowe at Dow is
a very charming fellow.

06:45.944 --> 06:48.846
Your father-in-law to be
is at corning, right?

06:48.914 --> 06:50.281
Well, they must be quite acquainted.

06:51.550 --> 06:53.184
I think that's likely.

06:53.252 --> 06:55.019
Well, I was thinking

06:55.087 --> 06:57.121
wouldn't it be fun to have
a foursome this weekend

06:57.189 --> 06:59.657
that includes your father-in-law,
yourself and Mr. Marlowe?

06:59.725 --> 07:01.626
Doesn't that sound like fun?

07:05.864 --> 07:08.166
I don't know.

07:08.233 --> 07:10.401
Ken, there's no reason to be suddenly shy.

07:10.469 --> 07:12.970
I'm sure if you impressed
Everett this morning

07:13.038 --> 07:15.173
that should be enough
to get him on the phone.

07:15.240 --> 07:16.974
Well, I just looked him in
the eye and convinced him

07:17.042 --> 07:19.444
I was some kind of idealistic businessman.

07:19.511 --> 07:21.312
How is it gonna look if
I call for a meeting?

07:21.380 --> 07:23.448
Pretty bad, I guess.

07:24.616 --> 07:27.352
But I'm not Pete.

07:27.419 --> 07:30.488
- Sorry about that.
- No, you're obviously not.

07:31.857 --> 07:34.025
Tom Vogel is our biggest client

07:34.093 --> 07:36.394
unless we sign Dow, which would be yours.

07:36.462 --> 07:38.863
Look, I love Cynthia's dad

07:38.931 --> 07:41.332
and I know that every account I
have will eventually leave me.

07:41.400 --> 07:42.867
That's awfully pessimistic.

07:42.935 --> 07:44.635
Well, it's not worth the risk.

07:44.703 --> 07:47.338
Cynthia's my life... My actual life.

07:49.708 --> 07:52.076
Fine, if you want to tuck it
between your legs, I'll call him,

07:52.144 --> 07:53.978
but I have to warn you,
I'm going to drop your name.

07:55.447 --> 07:57.181
You do whatever you want.

07:57.249 --> 07:59.984
Now if you don't mind,
I'm going to go service

08:00.052 --> 08:02.854
the 30% of this firm that are my clients.

08:12.531 --> 08:14.532
Hello, Carla. Is Sally home?

08:15.834 --> 08:18.136
She is, but you shouldn't be here.

08:18.203 --> 08:19.837
Are they moving today?

08:19.905 --> 08:23.307
Monday. That's the Salvation Army.

08:23.375 --> 08:26.110
Mrs. Draper's car is gone.
I just wanted to say hi.

08:26.178 --> 08:27.912
I don't know.

08:27.980 --> 08:30.114
Fine. I just want to say bye.

08:31.850 --> 08:34.284
She's upstairs.

08:34.352 --> 08:36.754
Don't be long. Mrs. Francis
just ran to the store.

08:36.822 --> 08:39.023
Thank you.

08:40.926 --> 08:42.626
It's Glen. Are you decent?

08:42.693 --> 08:44.429
Come in.

08:48.734 --> 08:50.568
You really shouldn't be here.

08:51.837 --> 08:54.605
So you're finally moving.

08:54.673 --> 08:58.142
This weekend while we're
in California with my dad.

08:58.210 --> 09:00.711
Jeez, is that where you're moving?

09:00.779 --> 09:02.213
No, we're moving to Rye.

09:05.584 --> 09:07.552
I'll be able to drive in a few years.

09:07.619 --> 09:09.821
- I can come visit.
- Really?

09:09.888 --> 09:11.522
Absolutely.

09:13.992 --> 09:16.060
I can send you postcards.

09:16.128 --> 09:17.929
I have your address.

09:17.996 --> 09:20.264
It's not that big a deal.

09:20.332 --> 09:22.400
I say goodbye to people all the time.

09:31.243 --> 09:33.811
Okay. Are you going to Disneyland?

09:33.879 --> 09:36.614
- Yes.
- Get me something.

09:48.360 --> 09:50.828
- What are you doing here?
- I'm sorry.

09:50.896 --> 09:53.097
- It's my fault.
- Get out.

09:54.666 --> 09:57.034
- What are you waiting for?
- Why do you hate me?

09:57.102 --> 09:58.870
You don't think I know what you're doing?

09:58.937 --> 10:01.873
- You could be friends with anyone!
- Just 'cause you're sad

10:01.940 --> 10:03.040
doesn't mean everybody has to be.

10:06.678 --> 10:08.579
I'm sorry.

10:08.647 --> 10:11.249
I didn't see the harm.
He wanted to say goodbye.

10:11.316 --> 10:14.685
- Did you leave them alone?
- They're friends, that's all.

10:14.753 --> 10:16.654
When did you decide that you're her mother?

10:17.890 --> 10:19.657
It was a mistake.

10:19.725 --> 10:21.692
There's no need for that kind of talk.

10:23.262 --> 10:24.762
You know what, Carla?

10:26.031 --> 10:27.632
I've been thinking

10:27.699 --> 10:29.667
and the distance is...

10:29.735 --> 10:31.836
I need someone new nearby,

10:31.904 --> 10:34.138
someone closer to the new house.

10:34.206 --> 10:36.274
This should square us for the week.

10:37.876 --> 10:40.545
Do you think I enjoy doing this?

10:40.612 --> 10:43.481
After all these years?
I won't have it, Carla.

10:46.919 --> 10:48.886
Well, someone has to
look after those children.

10:48.954 --> 10:51.656
Really? And where are your kids?

10:51.723 --> 10:54.592
- Are they all doctors and lawyers?
- You'd best stop talking now.

10:54.660 --> 10:58.863
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to say goodbye to the children.

10:58.931 --> 11:00.665
Do you think that's a good idea right now?

11:00.732 --> 11:02.567
It'll just upset them more.

11:02.634 --> 11:04.502
Some other time.

11:12.144 --> 11:14.412
The bungalow in San Pedro

11:14.479 --> 11:16.480
netted you 10 grand in profit.

11:16.548 --> 11:18.482
What's happening with the other house?

11:18.550 --> 11:21.886
I have a listing appointment with the
realtor when I get back from California,

11:21.954 --> 11:23.888
- but I have no idea what it's worth.
- It's ossining,

11:23.956 --> 11:25.590
but I say you'll more
than double your money,

11:25.657 --> 11:28.159
which is not bad for 10 years.

11:28.226 --> 11:30.528
What about the loss for what
I put into the company?

11:30.596 --> 11:32.563
That's an investment. It's not a loss.

11:32.631 --> 11:34.298
Don't be impatient.

11:34.366 --> 11:37.368
Enjoy the harvest. Plant some seeds.

11:37.436 --> 11:39.637
Maybe get a place of your own.

11:39.705 --> 11:42.740
Don't you want to go home someday
and see a steak on the table?

11:44.876 --> 11:47.311
So, Mary Sunshine,

11:47.379 --> 11:49.580
what's the capital gains? 48%?

11:49.648 --> 11:52.183
Mrs. Francis is on the phone.

11:52.250 --> 11:53.851
- It's urgent.
- You want me to go?

11:53.919 --> 11:55.486
It's always urgent.

11:57.122 --> 11:58.990
- Hello?
- I'm very sorry,

11:59.057 --> 12:00.691
and I know this will disrupt your plans,

12:00.759 --> 12:02.360
but I'm afraid I had to let Carla go today.

12:02.427 --> 12:04.328
What? What happened?

12:04.396 --> 12:06.731
Don, I have the children 99% of the time.

12:06.798 --> 12:08.265
This is a decision that I get to make.

12:08.333 --> 12:10.334
Well, can't I just hire
her back for the trip?

12:10.402 --> 12:13.337
No. I don't want her poisoning the well.

12:13.405 --> 12:15.272
I told the kids she's sick.

12:15.340 --> 12:17.441
So what the hell do I do,
Betty, with no help?

12:17.509 --> 12:21.145
I have meetings, two flights,
diapers, for Christ's sake.

12:21.213 --> 12:24.248
Then don't take them! They're used to it.

12:24.316 --> 12:26.117
We're going.

12:41.333 --> 12:44.201
Hey, pumpernickel,
there's nobody out front.

12:44.269 --> 12:46.270
- I already ate.
- Me too,

12:46.338 --> 12:48.439
and I ran into someone
I'd like you to meet.

12:48.507 --> 12:50.908
This is Carolyn Jones, like Morticia;

12:50.976 --> 12:53.544
Peggy Olson, advertising wunderkind.

12:53.612 --> 12:55.813
- Pleased to meet you.
- Do you mind?

12:58.016 --> 12:59.450
Carolyn was at a photo shoot

12:59.518 --> 13:01.752
modeling pantyhose of all things.

13:01.820 --> 13:04.388
She got fired and she has to make rent.

13:04.456 --> 13:08.259
Joyce witnessed my nervous breakdown
at Howard Johnson's today.

13:10.629 --> 13:12.329
Well hello, ladies.

13:12.397 --> 13:14.965
Peggy, I needed to talk to
you about my ABC meeting,

13:15.033 --> 13:16.567
but if I'm interrupting...

13:16.635 --> 13:19.036
Who is this lovely young thing?

13:19.104 --> 13:21.572
Harry, this is my friend Joyce.
I thought you'd already met.

13:21.640 --> 13:24.442
Harold Crane, head of media.

13:24.509 --> 13:27.044
- Carolyn Jones.
- No kidding.

13:27.112 --> 13:29.246
She's looking for work.

13:29.314 --> 13:31.115
That's hard to believe.

13:33.151 --> 13:35.586
As an actress, model?
What is your experience like?

13:35.654 --> 13:39.023
Well, I've been modeling,
at least until this morning.

13:39.091 --> 13:42.126
The Topaz people went nuts,
fired the people who hired me

13:42.194 --> 13:44.061
- and then me.
- But you didn't do anything wrong, did you?

13:44.129 --> 13:45.863
No, she didn't.

13:45.931 --> 13:47.531
Peggy, do you think you can help?

13:47.599 --> 13:49.200
Maybe.

13:49.267 --> 13:51.669
I'm sorry. You said Topaz fired everyone?

13:51.737 --> 13:54.638
- They were very brusque.
- People lose their heads.

13:54.706 --> 13:56.974
I'm sure it was a mistake, dear.

13:57.042 --> 13:58.943
We should be going, honey.

13:59.010 --> 14:01.212
Yes. Yes, of course.

14:01.279 --> 14:03.114
Pleased to meet you.

14:03.181 --> 14:04.982
We'll see what we can do, Carolyn Jones.

14:20.461 --> 14:23.063
Any luck?

14:23.130 --> 14:24.931
The hotel has a service,

14:24.999 --> 14:27.067
but the girls who can take
care of Sally and Bobby

14:27.134 --> 14:28.768
won't watch a two-year-old and vice versa.

14:28.836 --> 14:31.204
So I've arranged for two girls

14:31.272 --> 14:32.906
to cover the two mornings you're working.

14:32.973 --> 14:35.041
I thought you might need
someone for Disneyland

14:35.109 --> 14:38.178
and maybe handle the
Dodger game on your own.

14:38.245 --> 14:41.181
- Does that sound like a vacation?
- Maybe it'll be an adventure.

14:45.886 --> 14:47.720
How much do you make a week?

14:47.788 --> 14:50.557
- $70.
- What if I were to double that?

14:50.624 --> 14:54.194
I'll give you some nights free and
you'll get to go to California...

14:54.261 --> 14:56.029
Swimming pools, movie stars.

14:56.097 --> 14:58.731
I don't really have
any professional experience.

14:58.799 --> 15:01.067
You'll be great. Sally loved you,

15:01.135 --> 15:02.469
Bobby likes a pretty face

15:02.536 --> 15:05.171
and the baby... He's tough but he's fun.

15:06.574 --> 15:08.441
I've never been to California.

15:08.509 --> 15:11.211
I have a college friend who's
been begging me to visit.

15:11.278 --> 15:13.780
Perfect. Call her up, pick a night,

15:13.848 --> 15:16.716
I'll foot the bill.
What do you have to lose?

15:16.784 --> 15:19.953
Please stop the advertising.

15:25.025 --> 15:27.060
Come on. Let's go to the room first.

15:27.128 --> 15:29.095
Let's go or we're gonna go
back to the parking lot

15:29.163 --> 15:30.563
and spend the weekend locked in the car.

15:38.873 --> 15:43.209
Art Garten... Real name...
At Topaz pantyhose called me back.

15:43.277 --> 15:45.812
He was shocked and impressed that
I'd heard about them firing dupre.

15:45.880 --> 15:47.780
It gets better.
They already bought placement

15:47.848 --> 15:49.482
for the campaign that just fell apart,

15:49.550 --> 15:51.851
and we've been invited in
Monday to pick up the pieces.

15:51.919 --> 15:54.454
- I just told you that.
- Monday's a holiday.

15:54.522 --> 15:57.590
They're out of time. All we have to
do is not throw up on our shoes.

15:57.658 --> 15:59.726
- Do you want help?
- She's not gonna be there.

16:03.097 --> 16:04.564
Good work.

16:09.603 --> 16:11.137
Okay okay, here he is.

16:11.205 --> 16:15.375
♪ Il etait un petit navire ♪

16:15.442 --> 16:18.811
♪ il etait un petit navire ♪

16:18.879 --> 16:22.048
♪ qui n'avait ja-ja-jamais navigue ♪

16:22.116 --> 16:24.884
♪ qui n'avait ja-ja-jamais navigue ♪

16:24.952 --> 16:26.386
♪ ohe ohe. ♪

16:26.453 --> 16:29.189
That was great.

16:29.256 --> 16:31.157
It's how we got Gene to sleep.

16:31.225 --> 16:32.625
Well, let's not wake him up.

16:35.596 --> 16:38.264
They played in the pool for four hours

16:38.332 --> 16:41.067
and bounced on the bed for another two.

16:41.135 --> 16:43.903
I think everybody's gonna sleep very well.

16:43.971 --> 16:46.472
I need you to come over at
7:00 tomorrow to watch Gene.

16:46.540 --> 16:48.174
I'll get these two breakfast on the road.

16:48.242 --> 16:50.877
Okay. Bonne nuit, les animaux.

16:50.945 --> 16:52.679
- Good night.
- Good night.

16:52.746 --> 16:56.115
You said you didn't have any experience
and you're like Maria Von Trapp.

16:56.183 --> 16:57.917
Professionally,

16:57.985 --> 17:00.887
but I have four nieces and six nephews.

17:10.931 --> 17:13.800
Shh.

17:13.867 --> 17:16.536
So how was your meeting?

17:16.604 --> 17:19.739
Pick me up and move me to my bed.

17:24.111 --> 17:26.012
Well, hello there.

17:28.549 --> 17:31.451
Stephanie, this is Sally and Bobby.

17:31.518 --> 17:33.186
- Hello.
- Hi.

17:33.254 --> 17:35.488
Well, it's very nice to meet you.

17:35.556 --> 17:38.124
How do you like California?

17:39.460 --> 17:41.628
They love it.

17:41.695 --> 17:44.631
The notary is supposed to be
here at 10:00, but she's late.

17:44.698 --> 17:48.501
My mom put the papers in order
so all you have to do is sign

17:48.569 --> 17:50.403
and then you can go to Marineland.

17:51.905 --> 17:53.239
Who painted on the wall?

17:54.608 --> 17:57.410
My friend Anna. She used to live here.

17:57.478 --> 17:58.978
Stephanie is her niece.

18:00.314 --> 18:01.881
Who's Dick?

18:06.453 --> 18:07.820
Well...

18:09.657 --> 18:11.157
That's me.

18:13.994 --> 18:15.762
That's my nickname sometimes.

18:22.102 --> 18:23.836
Go out back and get us some lemons.

18:27.908 --> 18:30.109
They're adorable.

18:33.247 --> 18:35.748
- Is this it?
- My friend Charlie is gonna

18:35.816 --> 18:37.717
help me move the piano back to my mom's,

18:37.785 --> 18:41.788
and the rest of it goes
to St. Vincent de Paul.

18:41.855 --> 18:44.324
Four boxes. Good for her.

18:44.391 --> 18:47.694
Oh, she wanted
you to have something.

18:52.800 --> 18:54.701
It's her engagement ring from Don.

18:56.437 --> 18:59.405
- Don't you want it?
- She wanted you to have it.

18:59.473 --> 19:01.307
You shouldn't play around with that.

19:01.375 --> 19:03.543
Besides, I don't believe in it.

19:09.183 --> 19:10.683
So are you going back to school?

19:10.751 --> 19:12.285
Not for the moment.

19:12.353 --> 19:14.954
What are you gonna do?

19:15.022 --> 19:16.689
I don't know.

19:16.757 --> 19:18.691
That's the best part, right?

19:18.759 --> 19:20.560
Got the rest of my life ahead of me.

19:20.627 --> 19:21.828
So do you.

19:24.531 --> 19:25.698
Now that's her.

19:44.318 --> 19:45.618
Who's that?

19:46.954 --> 19:49.422
- How was it?
- Most of it was fun.

19:49.490 --> 19:52.325
- Daddy, are you coming in?
- I'm not wearing my bathing suit.

19:52.393 --> 19:53.826
Come in. You have to come in.

19:53.894 --> 19:56.362
- I want to be a shark.
- Come on, daddy.

19:58.665 --> 20:00.533
You swim all the time in New York.

20:00.601 --> 20:02.335
I'm really beat.

20:26.026 --> 20:29.195
Hey, should I throw
some herring to you two?

20:31.064 --> 20:33.299
Oh!

20:46.346 --> 20:50.149
Dumbo. Mad tea party.

20:50.217 --> 20:52.051
And Mr. Toad.

20:52.119 --> 20:53.619
Gene can't go on Mr. Toad.

20:53.687 --> 20:55.521
I'll get it.

20:55.589 --> 20:57.590
He can stay with Megan
while we go on the ride.

20:58.792 --> 21:00.293
Then Megan can't go.

21:03.230 --> 21:04.297
Hi, Sally.

21:05.966 --> 21:07.366
This is my friend Camille.

21:07.434 --> 21:10.903
Camille, this is Don,
Gene, Bobby and Sally.

21:10.971 --> 21:12.672
Hello, everybody.

21:12.739 --> 21:14.841
I just wanted to make sure you
didn't need anything else.

21:14.908 --> 21:16.476
No, I think we're okay.

21:17.911 --> 21:20.379
- Where are you going?
- The Whisky a Go Go.

21:20.447 --> 21:23.115
Well, good night, everybody.

21:23.183 --> 21:24.851
Good night. Have fun.

21:31.158 --> 21:32.859
What about Tomorrowland?

21:32.926 --> 21:34.427
I don't want to ride an elephant.

21:34.495 --> 21:36.295
I want to fly a jet.

21:39.851 --> 21:41.118
Hello.

21:41.185 --> 21:43.820
- Henry?
- I'm in here.

21:46.024 --> 21:48.859
I'm sorry. Everyone was late

21:48.927 --> 21:51.161
and then it took three of them to
light the pilot on the water heater.

21:51.229 --> 21:53.196
Carla called looking for you.

21:53.264 --> 21:55.966
Oh? And what did she want?

21:56.034 --> 21:58.402
You know what she wanted.

21:58.469 --> 22:00.370
You fired her and didn't tell me?

22:00.438 --> 22:02.539
Well, I am sorry.

22:02.607 --> 22:04.441
I didn't want her invoking your sympathies.

22:04.509 --> 22:07.778
- Why did you fire her?
- Because I don't trust her judgment.

22:07.845 --> 22:10.047
What did she say?

22:10.114 --> 22:12.783
She said you wouldn't give her
a letter of recommendation.

22:12.850 --> 22:14.518
How long did the woman work for you?

22:14.585 --> 22:16.787
I know she doesn't steal. What did she do?

22:16.854 --> 22:18.588
And don't tell me it's just
about the neighbor boy.

22:18.656 --> 22:20.724
Sally is not allowed to see him.

22:20.792 --> 22:23.226
- Carla said he's her friend.
- "Carla said"?

22:23.294 --> 22:25.929
- "Carla said"?!
- I don't understand what you're doing.

22:25.997 --> 22:28.999
You didn't want to move because you
wanted the kids to have some stability,

22:29.067 --> 22:31.134
and then you get rid of their
nanny since they were born?

22:31.202 --> 22:33.170
I wanted a fresh start, okay?

22:33.237 --> 22:35.973
- I'm entitled to that.
- There is no fresh start!

22:36.040 --> 22:37.674
Lives carry on!

22:37.742 --> 22:41.111
Jesus, Henry.
Just once could you take my side?

22:41.179 --> 22:43.280
No one's ever on your side, Betty.

23:14.345 --> 23:15.679
Just a minute.

23:23.187 --> 23:24.721
Am I bothering you?

23:24.789 --> 23:26.890
No, I was out on the
balcony enjoying the view.

23:28.626 --> 23:32.262
I heard you come in and I wanted to go over

23:32.330 --> 23:35.632
the plan for tomorrow for Disneyland.

23:35.700 --> 23:38.268
Do you think I should be involved
in such high-level decisions?

23:40.071 --> 23:41.972
Huh.

23:42.040 --> 23:44.141
I can't turn on the TV.
They're asleep.

23:53.718 --> 23:55.986
There's nothing on TV.

23:56.054 --> 23:57.988
Come outside with me.

23:58.056 --> 23:59.523
It's so beautiful here.

24:01.325 --> 24:02.859
Did you have fun with your friend?

24:02.927 --> 24:05.362
Uh, not really.

24:05.430 --> 24:07.130
She's not really my friend.

24:07.198 --> 24:09.099
We just lived together during college.

24:09.167 --> 24:12.002
My father's a professor.

24:12.036 --> 24:14.037
I think she liked him too much.

24:24.215 --> 24:26.016
So why did you see her?

24:27.885 --> 24:29.352
I don't know.

24:29.420 --> 24:31.721
She's an actress now.

24:31.789 --> 24:34.925
She's in two episodes of "Hogan's heroes."

24:34.992 --> 24:38.295
She told me I could never
do it because of my teeth.

24:38.362 --> 24:39.963
She actually said that to me.

24:41.933 --> 24:43.867
I don't even want to be an actress.

24:47.605 --> 24:49.372
I love your teeth.

24:51.442 --> 24:53.543
I took elocution lessons
when I moved to New York.

24:53.611 --> 24:56.346
The teacher said I had
the mouth of a singer.

25:12.396 --> 25:14.197
Are you sure we should do this?

25:15.633 --> 25:17.334
I've been thinking about you so much.

26:05.349 --> 26:07.817
Were you thinking about this
when I asked you to come?

26:11.489 --> 26:13.990
It was the first thought
that went through my head.

26:16.460 --> 26:18.361
I was gonna miss you so much, anyway.

26:20.398 --> 26:22.599
You don't know anything about me.

26:22.667 --> 26:24.534
But I do.

26:26.404 --> 26:28.238
I know that you have a good heart

26:28.306 --> 26:31.474
and I know that you're
always trying to be better.

26:33.110 --> 26:34.511
We all try.

26:35.947 --> 26:37.647
We don't always make it.

26:42.587 --> 26:44.287
I've done a lot of things.

26:46.724 --> 26:48.892
I know who you are now.

26:57.735 --> 26:59.736
It's getting light outside.

27:01.138 --> 27:03.673
I should get back before the sun comes up.

27:06.510 --> 27:07.978
They're little roosters.

27:12.016 --> 27:14.150
Then you should go.

27:14.218 --> 27:16.253
I don't want to confuse them.

27:26.897 --> 27:29.899
I want to know if I can knock on
this door again tomorrow night

27:29.967 --> 27:32.836
or if this is just what it is,

27:32.903 --> 27:34.437
like that night in the office.

27:35.973 --> 27:37.874
I need to know. I don't know why.

27:39.243 --> 27:40.944
Because you're afraid?

27:42.446 --> 27:45.015
You shouldn't be.

27:50.554 --> 27:52.989
Disneyland fireworks are at 9:00.

27:55.426 --> 27:58.628
How about dinner tomorrow night

27:58.696 --> 28:00.797
at 11:00 right here?

28:02.166 --> 28:04.167
We're gonna be together all day.

28:19.150 --> 28:22.085
This is Art.
Art, Ken Cosgrove and Patricia...

28:22.153 --> 28:24.054
- What was it?
- Peggy Olson.

28:24.121 --> 28:26.122
Sit. I'd offer you coffee,

28:26.190 --> 28:27.691
but everybody's gone for the holiday.

28:27.758 --> 28:29.359
The perils of being in charge.

28:31.662 --> 28:33.863
So you can tell we don't
have a lot of time.

28:33.931 --> 28:37.100
I mean not just today.
We're in kind of a bind.

28:37.168 --> 28:39.369
We're no worse than we were before,

28:39.437 --> 28:41.604
- and I hated those people.
- Do you have the old work?

28:41.672 --> 28:45.775
Somewhere. Look, it was a gorgeous girl...

28:45.843 --> 28:49.245
High heels, jewelry... Pulling
up this Cinderella gown

28:49.313 --> 28:51.014
to show the Topaz.

28:51.082 --> 28:53.616
But she wasn't Cinderella and
where the hell was she going?

28:53.684 --> 28:56.753
We want something that'll stand out.

28:56.821 --> 28:58.455
I don't care if it's a cartoon.

28:58.522 --> 29:00.390
I don't care if it's
Abe became wearing 'em.

29:00.458 --> 29:03.293
We're a tiny company.
We need to make a stink.

29:03.361 --> 29:06.429
Well, I've worn them but what qualities,

29:06.497 --> 29:08.898
in your mind, do they have
that make them unique?

29:08.966 --> 29:11.134
You're wearing them right now?

29:11.202 --> 29:14.771
Yes, because I can wear Topaz
pantyhose with anything.

29:14.839 --> 29:17.273
I'm wearing them at work right now

29:17.341 --> 29:20.143
and I'll change everything but
my hose before I go out tonight.

29:20.211 --> 29:22.679
One pair... That's all you need with Topaz.

29:24.548 --> 29:27.117
If we only sold each girl one
pair, we'd be out of business.

29:29.520 --> 29:33.123
"Topaz, the only pair of
pantyhose you'll ever need.

29:33.190 --> 29:35.358
Bad for business. Good for you."

29:36.627 --> 29:38.328
That's very funny,

29:38.396 --> 29:40.230
'cause it says our product's so good,

29:40.297 --> 29:42.732
we're not even interested in ourselves.

29:42.800 --> 29:45.101
Okay, that's one. What else you got?

29:45.169 --> 29:47.837
Um, well,

29:47.905 --> 29:50.807
I'd have to think more,
but it might be great

29:50.875 --> 29:52.575
to show a bunch of different outfits...

29:52.643 --> 29:54.778
One for formal, one for business,

29:54.845 --> 29:57.514
one a little sporty...

29:57.581 --> 30:00.550
And something like

30:00.618 --> 30:02.919
"single pair, singular comfort."

30:02.987 --> 30:04.921
It's got the word "single" in it.

30:04.989 --> 30:06.656
That's two.

30:25.974 --> 30:29.576
Daddy, tell Sally that
snakes used to have legs.

30:29.644 --> 30:31.111
I don't know if that's true.

30:31.179 --> 30:32.579
You know it's true in the Bible.

30:32.647 --> 30:34.648
We learned that they used to be fish

30:34.716 --> 30:36.950
and he doesn't know because
he has baby science.

30:37.018 --> 30:39.853
- They found a skeleton.
- Where? You don't know.

30:39.921 --> 30:42.156
- You're a short stuff.
- Okay, "Thally."

30:42.223 --> 30:44.892
- Shut up!
- Great.

30:46.461 --> 30:49.096
Don't be upset. It's just a milkshake.

30:51.132 --> 30:53.500
Can you grab a straw or some napkins?
This is my last dress.

31:12.820 --> 31:16.423
I'm sorry. Is it late?

31:18.159 --> 31:20.194
I wanted to let you sleep.

31:21.429 --> 31:23.163
How long have you been up?

31:23.231 --> 31:25.732
- A few hours.
- What's wrong?

31:28.736 --> 31:30.237
I couldn't sleep.

31:31.906 --> 31:33.874
I just kept thinking about you.

31:35.210 --> 31:36.977
Well, I'm right here.

31:41.149 --> 31:43.750
I don't know what it is about you but...

31:45.553 --> 31:47.721
I feel like myself

31:47.789 --> 31:50.557
when I'm with you,

31:50.625 --> 31:53.093
but the way I always wanted to feel.

31:56.664 --> 31:59.800
Because I'm in love with you, Megan,

31:59.867 --> 32:01.835
and I think I have been for a while.

32:04.105 --> 32:05.539
Don.

32:09.577 --> 32:11.445
Oh my goodness.

32:13.014 --> 32:14.214
Open it.

32:19.520 --> 32:21.455
It's beautiful.

32:23.157 --> 32:25.659
When I saw you sleeping there, I thought...

32:28.263 --> 32:31.265
I couldn't imagine not seeing
you there every morning.

32:34.836 --> 32:36.803
Will you marry me?

32:38.873 --> 32:40.507
Oh, I... I... I...

32:41.876 --> 32:43.944
I don't know what to say.

32:44.012 --> 32:46.079
This is all so fast.

32:46.147 --> 32:48.882
Did you ever think of the number of things

32:48.950 --> 32:51.752
that had to happen
for me to get to know you?

32:53.688 --> 32:54.988
But everything happened,

32:56.391 --> 32:58.258
and it got me here.

32:59.494 --> 33:01.061
What does that mean?

33:02.930 --> 33:04.665
I can't believe this.

33:06.167 --> 33:07.768
Yes. Yes.

33:20.315 --> 33:22.783
You have a ring? How long have
you been thinking about this?

33:22.850 --> 33:24.718
It's been in my family...

33:27.889 --> 33:29.856
Not my family, really.

33:31.793 --> 33:33.593
It belonged to someone
very important to me.

33:35.163 --> 33:37.130
I don't believe this.

33:37.198 --> 33:39.232
I have to call my mother.

33:39.300 --> 33:42.302
I had this feeling and I
called her from California

33:42.370 --> 33:44.838
- because I wanted it to go away.
- I saw it on the bill.

33:44.906 --> 33:47.274
Sorry.
I... I... I have to call her.

33:47.342 --> 33:48.809
Do you want me
to call her from work?

33:48.876 --> 33:51.578
No, call her.

33:51.646 --> 33:53.380
What about work? What do we do?

33:53.448 --> 33:55.682
We tell everybody.

33:55.750 --> 33:59.386
Oh. Okay.

34:03.791 --> 34:06.026
Do you want me to leave you alone?

34:06.094 --> 34:09.228
- Do you want me to talk to her?
- Oh. Do you speak French?

34:19.440 --> 34:22.042
Maman, c'est moi. J'ai des nouvelles.

34:22.110 --> 34:24.344
Va chercher papa, vite.

34:26.013 --> 34:28.081
What the hell's going on?

34:28.149 --> 34:29.983
I don't know. He wouldn't say.

34:30.051 --> 34:32.284
Look, it's you... Brown as a Berry.

34:32.353 --> 34:34.286
- How was the coast?
- Wonderful.

34:34.355 --> 34:36.156
Joan, could you shut the door?

34:40.128 --> 34:41.928
I have an announcement to make

34:41.996 --> 34:43.830
and it shouldn't change anything here

34:43.898 --> 34:45.831
except for me and maybe for Joan.

34:45.900 --> 34:49.536
But Miss Calvet and I are getting married.

34:51.072 --> 34:53.806
- Who the hell's that?
- Megan.

34:53.875 --> 34:55.542
Really?

34:58.713 --> 35:01.448
Congratulations, Don.

35:01.516 --> 35:03.250
I wish you the best of luck.

35:04.419 --> 35:05.919
Megan out there?

35:05.987 --> 35:07.521
Yeah, I know it's a surprise,

35:07.588 --> 35:10.690
but she makes me very happy

35:10.758 --> 35:13.293
and, well...

35:13.361 --> 35:15.262
It's something we both want very much.

35:16.497 --> 35:17.531
Well, let's get her in here.

35:20.234 --> 35:21.368
Megan.

35:25.873 --> 35:27.841
- How exciting for you.
- I know.

35:27.909 --> 35:30.444
- I can't believe it.
- Congratulations, dear.

35:30.511 --> 35:32.679
You don't say "congratulations" to the bride.

35:32.747 --> 35:34.381
You say "best wishes."

35:34.449 --> 35:36.183
Congratulations, Don.

35:36.250 --> 35:38.652
Let's have a toast.
Megan, could you get us some ice?

35:40.021 --> 35:41.822
I'm teasing.

35:41.889 --> 35:43.890
See, Don? This is the way to behave.

35:45.893 --> 35:48.662
- So when are you getting married?
- I don't know.

35:48.729 --> 35:51.031
- We haven't discussed it.
- Soon.

35:52.200 --> 35:54.434
Art Garten just called.

35:54.502 --> 35:57.204
No. What did he say?

35:57.271 --> 36:00.106
He said he liked ideas two and
four and we've got a week.

36:00.174 --> 36:01.908
Ah!

36:05.213 --> 36:07.714
- Shall we go rub it in?
- After you.

36:07.782 --> 36:09.282
You did it.

36:13.287 --> 36:15.555
- We've got some great news.
- Are you two getting married?

36:20.495 --> 36:22.195
What's going on?

36:23.464 --> 36:25.165
They're getting married.

36:26.601 --> 36:29.135
- Really?
- Oh, congratulations.

36:29.203 --> 36:31.004
- Thank you.
- It's incredible.

36:31.072 --> 36:32.839
I know. It just happened.

36:32.907 --> 36:36.276
That's incredible. You must be so happy.

36:40.147 --> 36:42.182
Um, I'll get it.

36:45.086 --> 36:48.021
We have some news too. Peg.

36:48.089 --> 36:50.524
Yes, we signed an account...

36:50.591 --> 36:53.226
Topaz pantyhose.
It's a quarter of a million dollars.

36:53.294 --> 36:55.562
- How'd you do that?
- Peggy found out about them

36:55.630 --> 36:57.030
and then we met over the holiday.

36:57.098 --> 36:59.699
That's great news. We broke the streak.

36:59.767 --> 37:03.036
What a great day. Good work, both of you.

37:03.104 --> 37:05.672
So anyway, I guess we should tell everybody.

37:05.740 --> 37:07.841
Topaz needs work this week.

37:07.909 --> 37:09.910
I hope you have all the happiness

37:09.977 --> 37:13.313
that Peggy and I had signing this account.

37:13.381 --> 37:15.015
I'll be there in a minute.

37:21.022 --> 37:22.756
Wow.

37:24.091 --> 37:25.959
It's been going on awhile,

37:26.027 --> 37:29.896
but I appreciate your concern.

37:29.964 --> 37:32.999
Well, then I'm happy for you...

37:33.067 --> 37:35.101
Both of you.

37:36.404 --> 37:38.471
She's very beautiful.

37:39.674 --> 37:41.308
You know she reminds me of you.

37:42.877 --> 37:44.511
She's got the same spark.

37:45.913 --> 37:48.515
I know she admires you
just as much as I do.

38:04.332 --> 38:05.899
It was Dr. Miller again.

38:08.235 --> 38:10.904
It's not gonna get any
easier the longer you wait.

38:16.744 --> 38:19.212
Whatever could be on your mind?

38:23.618 --> 38:25.485
Can you believe it?

38:25.553 --> 38:28.154
It happens all the time.

38:28.222 --> 38:30.657
They're all just between marriages.
You know that.

38:31.993 --> 38:33.994
He'll probably make her a copywriter.

38:34.061 --> 38:36.863
He's not going to want
to be married to his secretary.

38:36.931 --> 38:40.333
Really? Is that what he meant?

38:40.401 --> 38:43.003
"She admires you"?

38:43.070 --> 38:44.270
Jesus.

38:45.806 --> 38:48.008
That's the way it works for some.

38:49.543 --> 38:52.479
You know, I just saved this company.

38:52.546 --> 38:55.415
I signed the first new business
since Lucky Strike left,

38:55.483 --> 38:57.517
but it's not as important
as getting married.

38:57.585 --> 38:59.219
Again.

38:59.286 --> 39:02.756
Well, I was just made Director
of Agency Operations...

39:02.823 --> 39:05.425
A title, no money of course...

39:05.493 --> 39:07.427
And if they poured champagne,
it must've been

39:07.495 --> 39:09.195
while I was pushing the mail cart.

39:09.263 --> 39:11.297
A pretty face comes along

39:11.365 --> 39:12.899
and everything goes out the window.

39:12.967 --> 39:15.602
Well, I learned a long time ago

39:15.670 --> 39:18.204
to not get all my
satisfaction from this job.

39:20.174 --> 39:21.441
That's bullshit.

39:39.280 --> 39:41.581
- Faye Miller.
- Hi, it's me.

39:43.384 --> 39:45.552
I was starting to worry
you were ill or something.

39:46.787 --> 39:48.355
I need to talk to you.

39:48.422 --> 39:50.924
Well, I was gonna come by at lunch anyway.

39:50.992 --> 39:52.926
Oh, no, you shouldn't do that.

39:52.994 --> 39:54.361
Why don't we meet somewhere?

39:55.930 --> 39:57.464
What is going on?

39:59.233 --> 40:01.401
Something happened
and I'd like to talk to you

40:01.469 --> 40:03.136
about it face to face.

40:03.204 --> 40:04.771
Meet me for coffee.

40:05.940 --> 40:07.274
Okay.

40:10.077 --> 40:11.144
You know what?

40:11.212 --> 40:13.613
I'm not gonna have some conversation

40:13.681 --> 40:15.482
and have to sit through coffee afterwards.

40:16.651 --> 40:17.984
Just get to it.

40:25.192 --> 40:28.094
Well, I...

40:29.864 --> 40:31.331
Met somebody...

40:33.668 --> 40:36.569
And we're engaged.

40:36.637 --> 40:38.805
Are you kidding me?

40:38.873 --> 40:42.742
I know... I know, it's a surprise.
It was for me too.

40:43.878 --> 40:45.545
Jesus.

40:45.613 --> 40:47.247
Who is she?

40:48.549 --> 40:50.717
What's the difference?

40:50.785 --> 40:52.652
I fell in love.

40:54.021 --> 40:55.555
I didn't mean for this to happen.

40:55.623 --> 40:59.926
You've been very important to me.

41:01.262 --> 41:02.762
So you're not gonna put an ad

41:02.830 --> 41:05.031
in "The New York Times"
saying you never liked me?

41:05.099 --> 41:08.068
- Faye.
- Well, I hope you're very happy,

41:08.135 --> 41:11.504
and I hope she knows you only
like the beginnings of things.

41:13.307 --> 41:15.542
I'm sorry.

41:15.609 --> 41:17.477
I don't know what else to say.

41:17.545 --> 41:18.712
Goodbye.

41:33.494 --> 41:34.995
I saw the light go off.

41:36.330 --> 41:39.332
It's fine. It's done.

41:47.575 --> 41:49.442
I love you, you know.

42:02.923 --> 42:04.391
And he's smiling like a fool,

42:04.458 --> 42:06.760
like he's the first man that
ever married his secretary.

42:06.827 --> 42:09.396
She's 25, as if that's news.

42:09.463 --> 42:11.464
So when are you going
to tell them your news?

42:11.532 --> 42:13.466
They'll know soon enough.

42:13.534 --> 42:16.770
Are you showing at all?
The picture I have of you doesn't change.

42:16.837 --> 42:19.639
I'll take a new one and I'll send it to you.

42:19.707 --> 42:22.042
You know all I want to know.

42:22.109 --> 42:25.378
Yes, honey, they're bigger.

42:25.446 --> 42:27.981
Oh! Why are you torturing me?

42:28.049 --> 42:30.183
I just woke up and it's already 90° here.

42:31.752 --> 42:33.853
Listen, I've gotta go.

42:33.921 --> 42:36.156
- Not yet.
- What?

42:36.223 --> 42:38.358
Not yet.

42:38.426 --> 42:41.895
Now you listen to the doctor. You have to eat.
Don't worry about your figure.

42:41.962 --> 42:43.997
I'll whip you and the baby
into shape when I get back.

42:44.065 --> 42:45.732
Okay.

42:47.201 --> 42:49.135
I'll call you Thursday night your time.

42:49.203 --> 42:52.238
Okay. I love you.

42:52.306 --> 42:54.074
I love you too.

43:17.698 --> 43:20.667
Hello?

43:20.734 --> 43:23.570
Mrs. Truxton?

43:23.637 --> 43:25.605
No, it's me.

43:27.508 --> 43:30.710
- What are you doing here?
- It's Tuesday at 7:00.

43:30.778 --> 43:32.912
I thought I told you I had a listing
appointment with the real estate agent.

43:35.316 --> 43:37.317
Oh, I didn't realize that was today.

43:37.384 --> 43:40.820
I forgot about the cabinets
in the guest bath.

43:40.888 --> 43:42.489
So you weren't that thorough?

43:42.556 --> 43:44.290
I guess not.

43:53.134 --> 43:54.868
Ah.

44:10.084 --> 44:13.186
Do you like the new house?

44:13.254 --> 44:16.389
I do. It's got a lot of character.

44:17.725 --> 44:19.526
I'll probably have to tear out the kitchen.

44:23.597 --> 44:25.231
Remember this place?

44:27.334 --> 44:28.935
I do.

44:31.071 --> 44:32.805
It's different. That's for certain.

44:34.341 --> 44:35.842
Isn't that what you wanted?

44:37.011 --> 44:38.878
I don't know, Don.

44:43.217 --> 44:45.084
Things aren't perfect.

44:47.521 --> 44:49.656
So you'll move again.

44:55.529 --> 44:57.263
So much changes

44:57.331 --> 44:59.065
it's made everything...

45:00.701 --> 45:02.101
Difficult.

45:08.309 --> 45:10.276
I have to tell you something.

45:13.514 --> 45:15.048
I met someone.

45:18.185 --> 45:19.686
I'm engaged.

45:22.122 --> 45:23.756
Really?

45:27.561 --> 45:29.128
Bethany Van Nuys?

45:29.196 --> 45:32.232
No. Someone at work.

45:33.534 --> 45:34.968
Oh.

45:47.014 --> 45:48.982
I'm very happy for you.

45:51.719 --> 45:53.386
It's okay, Betty.

45:56.523 --> 45:58.491
I don't know why I'm surprised.

46:01.862 --> 46:04.597
Is she your secretary?
I know she watched the kids in California.

46:04.665 --> 46:05.932
Yes.

46:12.072 --> 46:15.041
So I will see you the weekend after next.
What is that, the 23rd?

46:15.109 --> 46:16.542
I think so.

46:18.612 --> 46:20.013
Wait.

46:31.025 --> 46:33.493
Congratulations.

46:33.560 --> 46:35.461
Thank you.
