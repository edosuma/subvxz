00:27.569 --> 00:28.945
[Fisk] <i>Nadeem!</i>

00:30.238 --> 00:32.907
-[Fisk shouting]
-[gunshots and glass shattering]

00:35.118 --> 00:36.161
[agent] <i>Stay in the car!</i>

00:37.245 --> 00:38.913
[man 1] <i>Don't shoot! We surrender!</i>

00:39.456 --> 00:41.624
[Dex] <i>Convict. Don't move.</i>

00:41.708 --> 00:42.917
[sirens wailing]

00:46.671 --> 00:47.922
[panting]

00:50.842 --> 00:53.136
-[Ray] Move! Move!
-[officer] Get back! Back it up!

00:54.929 --> 00:56.097
I need to make a call.

00:56.181 --> 00:57.307
Lobby's secure.

00:57.390 --> 00:59.017
Straight to the nest! Move!

01:01.686 --> 01:03.688
[Ray] SAC's inbound.
What the hell happened?

01:03.772 --> 01:04.814
[Dex] Ambush.

01:04.898 --> 01:07.275
-They were everywhere.
-[Ray] Do you have status on anyone?

01:07.358 --> 01:10.987
[Dex] Two agents in surgery now.
We lost five for this shitbag.

01:14.282 --> 01:15.992
-[Fisk] Donovan!
-[Ray] Stay back.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.870
-We're his attorneys.
-Congratulations. Stay back.

01:19.621 --> 01:20.872
Locate Vanessa.

01:21.664 --> 01:25.293
The Albanians, they tried to get me.
They'll go for her, too.

01:25.376 --> 01:28.922
[Donovan] My client is not implying that
he knows how to reach a wanted fugitive.

01:29.005 --> 01:30.632
And make sure she's safe!

01:42.602 --> 01:43.895
[elevator dings]

01:46.272 --> 01:48.274
[indistinct radio chatter]

01:50.568 --> 01:53.822
[sighs] We're good. Get the medic.

01:53.905 --> 01:56.282
-[Dex] He's fine.
-[Ray] For me, not him.

01:56.366 --> 01:58.952
Copy that. Shitbag's all yours.

01:59.035 --> 02:00.578
[Ray] Dex... Hold on.

02:02.622 --> 02:03.957
Check in with the SAC.

02:04.040 --> 02:07.001
[Dex] We're down too many agents.
The debrief can wait.

02:07.085 --> 02:08.586
[Ray] You know the deal.

02:08.670 --> 02:11.047
Follow the protocol
and get back here ASAP.

02:21.015 --> 02:23.351
[Ray] You will be confined
to these quarters.

02:25.311 --> 02:27.605
You'll be monitored at all times.

02:28.398 --> 02:31.693
You are allowed no outside contact
other than your lawyers.

02:32.402 --> 02:35.113
Armed guards will be
stationed outside 24/7.

02:42.328 --> 02:43.580
You'll be safe here.

02:44.330 --> 02:47.041
"Safe." You nearly had me killed.

02:47.125 --> 02:49.169
Good men died tonight.

02:50.044 --> 02:52.881
You will make their sacrifice
worth something.

02:54.424 --> 02:57.260
Or you can shove our deal up your ass.

02:58.469 --> 03:00.096
[Arinori] <i>Hey, convict...</i>

03:00.847 --> 03:02.265
your lawyers are here.

03:16.154 --> 03:17.155
Get dry.

03:17.238 --> 03:18.489
Get dressed.

03:22.577 --> 03:24.287
[Fisk] Did you reach her?

03:24.370 --> 03:26.998
I need these cameras shut off
and a moment with my client.

03:27.081 --> 03:30.043
-[Fisk] Forget about the cameras.
-[agent] Kill the cameras till they leave.

03:34.756 --> 03:36.382
Is Vanessa safe? [Donovan] We don't know.

03:39.677 --> 03:41.054
She's missing.

03:45.266 --> 03:47.268
[theme music playing]

04:52.166 --> 04:56.838
Oh, God. I don't know, it's been...
uh, three months since I had one.

04:56.921 --> 04:58.631
-See, now, that's bad.
-Yeah.

04:58.715 --> 05:00.925
Yeah, it's been about a month for me.

05:01.009 --> 05:03.094
I've been elbows deep in, uh, research,

05:03.177 --> 05:05.722
but it feels like 100 years
since I had a home-cooked meal.

05:05.805 --> 05:07.807
-This is all Uncle Mitchell.
-[Ellison] Please, stop.

05:07.890 --> 05:10.435
Left to my own devices,
we'd be ordering Wo Hop every night.

05:10.518 --> 05:13.521
-Nothing wrong with that.
-This woman does it all.

05:13.604 --> 05:17.442
Not only does she run <i>Proxy Magazine,</i>
she is an expert orderer.

05:17.525 --> 05:19.235
-Stop it.
-[Ellison] No, it's true.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.112
You're amazing. It's like a skill.

05:21.195 --> 05:23.281
Right? You know all the best dishes
on every menu.

05:23.364 --> 05:25.783
You always order the right amount.
Never too much, too little.

05:25.867 --> 05:26.993
[clicks tongue] It's perfect.

05:27.076 --> 05:29.746
-[Lily] He'd be lost without me.
-[Ellison] I would.

05:29.829 --> 05:32.332
-[Jason] Disgusting.
-Are they always like this?

05:32.915 --> 05:35.168
When I was eight,
they renewed their vows on Long Beach

05:35.251 --> 05:36.836
-in front of the whole family.
-No.

05:36.919 --> 05:39.130
Aunt Lily hired one of those planes
that write in the sky.

05:39.213 --> 05:42.467
-Oh, my God. Did you really? [chuckles]
-I did.

05:42.550 --> 05:45.094
-So, how did you two meet?
-[Lily] Kind of like you guys, actually.

05:45.178 --> 05:48.181
We were set up
by our college newspaper editor.

05:51.392 --> 05:54.437
-Oh. Mitchell, did you not tell them?
-[clears throat]

05:54.520 --> 05:57.315
-[Jason] Uncle Mitchell...
-I am so sorry. I had no idea.

05:57.398 --> 05:59.692
I had no... I was--
I had nothing to do with it.

06:00.360 --> 06:03.654
[sighs] You know what?
Uh, we need... We need more wine.

06:06.741 --> 06:09.619
-Really?
-[stammers] I get it. I'm sorry.

06:09.702 --> 06:10.578
-[scoffs]
-You know...

06:10.661 --> 06:13.790
I knew that if I had actually asked you,
you'd have said no.

06:13.873 --> 06:16.292
Right. See, that's the part
where it gets to be my choice.

06:16.376 --> 06:17.794
I know you meant well, but this--

06:17.877 --> 06:20.213
-You could use some happy.
-I am happy.

06:24.509 --> 06:27.678
Look, I'm not, um... I'm not ready.

06:30.098 --> 06:34.102
All right, well, if you want to leave,
I'll understand.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.730
I'm sure Jason will, too.

06:40.608 --> 06:42.485
[inhales and exhales deeply]

06:45.196 --> 06:47.031
-[Karen laughs]
-[indistinct chatter]

06:47.949 --> 06:50.952
So, wait. You're telling me
that you named your cat Ralph?

06:51.702 --> 06:52.745
-[Jason] Ellison.
-Oh.

06:52.829 --> 06:56.541
Hey! I have a PhD in Am Lit.
He's my favorite author. "Life is to be lived, not controlled.
Humanity is won by--"

07:01.212 --> 07:03.089
[Karen] I know this one, actually...

07:03.798 --> 07:07.343
"Humanity is won by continuing to play
in the face of certain defeat."

07:07.427 --> 07:08.428
Is that right?

07:09.095 --> 07:10.346
How do you know the quote?

07:10.430 --> 07:12.306
I was going to be an English major.

07:12.390 --> 07:15.268
<i>Invisible Man</i> would have been
a big part of my curriculum,

07:15.351 --> 07:18.020
but that was another lifetime. [chuckles]

07:18.104 --> 07:19.522
[Jason] You made out okay.

07:19.605 --> 07:22.191
A revered journalist
with an acclaimed publication.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.152
-Okay.
-Too much, honey.

07:24.235 --> 07:27.947
So, tell me, you ever worry
little Ralph's plotting your demise?

07:28.030 --> 07:28.865
[Jason laughs]

07:29.782 --> 07:31.868
-[Jason] I take it you're a dog person.
-Absolutely.

07:31.951 --> 07:35.705
I don't know, I like the company.
Shared a room with my brother growing up.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.332
The apartment felt empty till I got Ralph.

07:38.416 --> 07:40.751
How about you? Any, uh, siblings?

07:42.086 --> 07:43.671
-Uh. More wine?
-Um...

07:43.754 --> 07:46.799
Yeah. No, I had a brother, too, but, um...

07:46.883 --> 07:48.426
but he died.

07:48.509 --> 07:50.761
-[Jason] I'm sorry.
-No, it's okay.

07:52.180 --> 07:54.682
-Who wants dessert?
-That'd be great. Thank you. [laughs]

07:54.765 --> 07:56.893
-[cell phone vibrating]
-[Ellison sighs]

07:57.310 --> 07:59.770
Sorry. I'm sorry. Yeah. Ellison.

07:59.854 --> 08:01.606
-[cell phone ringing]
-Uh, sorry.

08:05.860 --> 08:06.986
Karen Page.

08:10.031 --> 08:12.825
-Who in the hell would let out Fisk?
-[Ellison] Don't say his name.

08:12.909 --> 08:14.160
What? Why?

08:14.243 --> 08:17.914
[sighs] After Ben died, Lily was
inconsolable. They were really close.

08:17.997 --> 08:22.168
And, you know, it turned out that somebody
at my office had been working for him.

08:22.752 --> 08:24.837
We'd gotten to the point where
an hour could go by,

08:24.921 --> 08:27.215
and I didn't have to call
to reassure that I'm alive.

08:27.298 --> 08:28.508
-I understand.
-Good.

08:28.591 --> 08:32.678
Then you won't push back when I tell you,
you are staying away from this story.

08:32.762 --> 08:34.055
[chuckles] I can't do that.

08:34.138 --> 08:36.015
Yes, you can. And you will.

08:36.098 --> 08:38.351
Look, I get it.
I have a history with... that man.

08:38.434 --> 08:40.061
-Makes it a conflict of interest.
-Exactly.

08:40.144 --> 08:42.396
But I also know him better
than anyone else on our staff.

08:42.480 --> 08:45.483
-Doesn't that give me a unique angle?
-It gives you a bias. Look, it's not up for discussion.
Enjoy the pie.

08:51.989 --> 08:52.949
[door closes]

08:54.033 --> 08:54.992
[sighs]

08:55.826 --> 08:58.704
[man on TV] <i>And, darling, that is not</i>
<i>a dress, that is a disaster.</i>

08:58.788 --> 09:01.582
[woman on TV] <i>I worked on it with all</i>
<i>the materials available to me,</i>

09:01.666 --> 09:03.584
<i>and I did the best with the time...</i>

09:03.668 --> 09:04.794
[gasps]

09:05.503 --> 09:07.129
[sighs] Baby...

09:10.299 --> 09:13.261
What was it this time? Laughing Matt?

09:15.304 --> 09:17.223
[inhales deeply] Body Matt.

09:17.848 --> 09:23.854
Foggy Bear, whatever happened to Matt,
it's not your fault.

09:24.814 --> 09:27.358
You have nothing to feel guilty about.

09:28.150 --> 09:30.027
Because I have this great life?

09:30.611 --> 09:34.448
Beautiful girlfriend, high-paying job,
expensive suits...

09:36.534 --> 09:38.411
I always wanted a good suit.

09:39.954 --> 09:42.373
I have it all, but Matt's just...

09:46.210 --> 09:47.253
gone.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.883
Maybe you should talk to someone.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.053
It won't bring him back.

09:56.887 --> 09:58.347
But it might help you.

10:03.102 --> 10:04.979
[sighs] I can't.

10:06.188 --> 10:07.523
Why not?

10:08.274 --> 10:10.276
[exhales deeply]

10:13.362 --> 10:16.115
Sorry. Go back to your brief.

10:19.243 --> 10:22.496
Take a pill.
There's some in the medicine cabinet.

10:29.503 --> 10:31.464
No. No. No.

10:36.052 --> 10:39.597
[crowd chanting] Lock Fisk up!
Lock Fisk up!

10:39.680 --> 10:43.267
Lock Fisk up! Lock Fisk up!

10:43.351 --> 10:45.353
[chanting continues]

11:04.664 --> 11:06.290
Doesn't make any sense.

11:08.668 --> 11:12.463
Of course it does. God is angry with you.

11:14.048 --> 11:15.675
What are you talking about?

11:18.219 --> 11:21.305
You don't think God knows
you tried to kill yourself?

11:23.432 --> 11:24.433
No.

11:26.477 --> 11:28.437
That has nothing to do with this.

11:29.438 --> 11:31.524
God restored your hearing...

11:32.233 --> 11:36.696
just in time to hear my name
chanted by the crowds.

11:36.779 --> 11:41.617
Just in time to learn, in the long run,
I won, you lost.

11:42.410 --> 11:44.745
Does that sound like God's forgiveness?

11:47.248 --> 11:48.249
No.

11:49.625 --> 11:53.003
It sounds like... hell.

11:53.713 --> 11:57.049
[crowd chanting] Lock Fisk up!
Lock Fisk up!

11:57.466 --> 11:59.635
[chanting continues]

12:00.761 --> 12:03.055
You'll never keep Karen safe.

12:06.308 --> 12:08.978
-In the end, you'll kill her, too.
-Stop it.

12:09.937 --> 12:11.689
Just like your father.

12:11.772 --> 12:13.649
-And Stick.
-I said stop.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.943
-And Elektra.
-[chuckles]

12:18.571 --> 12:20.865
They all died because of you, Matthew.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.541
[Karen] I can't believe this.
This is insane.

12:30.624 --> 12:32.001
[officer] You're that reporter.

12:32.710 --> 12:34.920
Sorry. Karen Page, <i>Bulletin.</i>

12:37.339 --> 12:40.259
Uh... Sorry, who's in charge here?

12:41.886 --> 12:44.305
That's the genius who got him out.
Agent Nadeem.

12:44.388 --> 12:45.389
Thanks.

12:48.934 --> 12:50.060
Agent Nadeem.

12:52.772 --> 12:56.108
[Ray] Soon as I'm done here.
There's a vigil at the hospital.

12:56.192 --> 12:59.320
Just give Sami a hug for me. You, too.

13:01.864 --> 13:04.492
Hi. Karen Page of the <i>New York Bulletin.</i>

13:05.284 --> 13:07.119
I'm not authorized to speak to the press.

13:07.203 --> 13:09.455
You need to find
Special Agent In Charge Hattley.

13:09.538 --> 13:11.665
But it is N-A-D-E-E-M, right?

13:11.749 --> 13:13.751
And you're the agent
who released Wilson Fisk?

13:14.460 --> 13:17.171
Fisk has not been released.
That's fake news.

13:17.254 --> 13:19.048
-[chuckles]
-[Ray] He's a cooperating witness,

13:19.131 --> 13:22.218
but he's very much a convicted prisoner
and being treated as such.

13:22.301 --> 13:23.844
Being held in a $20 million penthouse?

13:23.928 --> 13:27.139
Seized by the US Government from some
Wall Street prick convicted of fraud.

13:27.223 --> 13:29.683
Oh. Oh, I get it. Okay,
so what's he having for dinner?

13:29.767 --> 13:32.853
Is it the filet mignon
or the line-caught halibut?

13:32.937 --> 13:35.189
Press area is over there.

13:35.272 --> 13:37.900
[Karen] One RICO count carries
a 20-year sentence.

13:38.567 --> 13:42.655
Fisk was convicted on five.
Want to explain to me how this is justice?

13:45.658 --> 13:48.619
Jennings, Garcia, Foster,
Leighton, Torres.

13:49.286 --> 13:52.456
They lost their lives,
and they were good agents, good people.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.334
Write about that, Ms. Page.

14:07.680 --> 14:08.681
[man 1] All right...

14:09.557 --> 14:10.850
get it up there.

14:12.017 --> 14:13.853
-[man 1] All right?
-[man 2] Yeah. Okay.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.066
[man 1] Excuse us. Watch yourself.

14:21.569 --> 14:24.780
[keypad beeping]

14:24.864 --> 14:26.657
-[door buzzes]
-Nine-one-seven-four.

14:46.969 --> 14:48.846
[keypad beeping]

14:48.929 --> 14:50.598
[door rattles]

14:54.685 --> 14:55.603
[door buzzes]

14:59.857 --> 15:00.858
[Matt] Thanks.

15:10.826 --> 15:13.537
Oh. Hey, man, hand me one of those BNCs,
would ya?

15:18.042 --> 15:21.545
Thanks. Dude, I said a BNC...

15:28.886 --> 15:31.805
[man 1] Yes, I've checked three times.
I have the tickets.

15:31.889 --> 15:34.099
[woman 1] Okay, okay.
I just wanted to be sure.

15:34.183 --> 15:37.186
With this mess outside,
we don't wanna have to come back.

15:43.609 --> 15:46.654
-[woman 2] Do you think we're safe?
-[man 2] We should check out.

15:46.737 --> 15:49.490
[man 3] We booked this months ago.
Now we have to deal with this?

15:49.573 --> 15:50.866
[man 4] We're checking out early.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.868
[desk clerk] We are very sorry
for the disruption.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.037
Can we assist you in making
reservations elsewhere?

15:55.120 --> 15:57.498
[man 4] Do you know who I am?
You know who he is, right?

15:57.581 --> 15:58.999
[desk clerk] Just one moment, sir.

16:03.462 --> 16:05.255
[agent 1 over radio] <i>Watch rotation.</i>
<i>Sound off.</i>

16:06.215 --> 16:07.925
[agent 2 over radio] <i>North entrance</i>
<i>is green.</i>

16:08.759 --> 16:10.552
[agent 3 over radio] <i>West entrance</i>
<i>is green.</i>

16:10.636 --> 16:12.262
[agent 4 over radio] <i>Service area</i>
<i>is green.</i>

16:15.391 --> 16:16.725
[Doyle] Lobby is green.

16:24.566 --> 16:27.069
So, you're inside. Now what?

16:27.611 --> 16:29.530
Why would they let you out?

16:30.239 --> 16:31.657
Does it matter?

16:31.740 --> 16:35.703
The real question is, when you find me,
what are you prepared to do?

16:35.786 --> 16:39.206
See, if the FBI are protecting you,
that means you cut a deal.

16:40.749 --> 16:43.711
With everything I know
about crime in this city...

16:44.503 --> 16:46.296
the FBI will be eating out of my hand.

16:46.380 --> 16:48.924
-You'll manipulate them.
-You don't know that.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.843
[chuckles] I know you.

16:52.177 --> 16:54.221
Maybe prison has changed me.

16:54.304 --> 16:56.515
-[laughs]
<i>-</i>[Fisk] Maybe right this moment

16:56.598 --> 16:59.893
I'm giving the FBI information
that will save lives.

17:00.519 --> 17:04.398
While you're here doing what?
Whatever this is.

17:05.566 --> 17:07.985
-Wouldn't that be something?
-[clicks tongue]

17:08.068 --> 17:11.572
[Fisk] If I became more valuable
to this city than you ever were.

17:51.445 --> 17:53.697
[Lim] Garcia was the best man
at my wedding. Word is Andrews will pull through.

17:57.534 --> 18:00.746
If you call probably never going
to walk again pulling through.

18:03.207 --> 18:04.208
[sighs]

18:04.958 --> 18:07.878
That's hard. That's really hard.

18:09.546 --> 18:11.298
[Lim] And he gets a penthouse.

18:14.551 --> 18:18.472
Shut the cameras off, please.
We need time with our client.

18:23.560 --> 18:24.561
[clears throat]

18:33.862 --> 18:34.988
And?

18:35.072 --> 18:37.449
[Donovan] We reached Felix Manning.
Vanessa's safe.

18:37.533 --> 18:40.119
Her bodyguards
relocate her every 72 hours,

18:40.202 --> 18:43.205
and they take precautions
to avoid being tracked.

18:43.288 --> 18:46.083
No cell phones.
It's why they were unreachable.

18:46.166 --> 18:47.251
Where is she now?

18:47.334 --> 18:49.837
[Lee] A safe house outside Barcelona.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.802
Felix hid her in Spain?

18:56.885 --> 18:58.387
[Donovan] It was her decision.

18:58.470 --> 19:02.141
We strongly advised against Europe,
given the extradition risk,

19:02.224 --> 19:06.145
but Ms. Marianna enjoys the art
and she can be very insistent.

19:10.524 --> 19:13.402
Yes, she can.

19:17.114 --> 19:20.367
But it's too easy for the Albanians
to get at her there.

19:22.202 --> 19:23.537
Call Felix.

19:24.955 --> 19:28.000
Tell him to put Vanessa some place safer.

19:29.751 --> 19:31.336
Some place closer.

19:36.133 --> 19:37.342
[exhales sharply]

19:56.195 --> 19:59.656
[Tower] "Homicides are down,
burglaries down, assaults down.

19:59.740 --> 20:01.825
I have not accomplished this alone.

20:01.909 --> 20:04.912
The good people of Hell's Kitchen
have said no more.

20:04.995 --> 20:07.122
Together with the NYPD,

20:07.206 --> 20:09.583
we have begun to take
our neighborhoods back.

20:09.666 --> 20:14.213
Reelect me for district attorney,
and let's continue to take our city back.

20:14.880 --> 20:15.923
Together."

20:17.883 --> 20:19.218
How was that?

20:19.301 --> 20:21.511
Too many "togethers."
Sounds like a Beatles' song.

20:21.595 --> 20:23.430
[Tower] Okay, but is that good?

20:23.513 --> 20:24.514
[Arlene] No.

20:28.018 --> 20:31.355
-Wow. I'm inspired.
-[Tower] Mr. Nelson.

20:31.438 --> 20:33.732
[Arlene] Mr. Tower, you need to get ready.

20:33.815 --> 20:37.110
I believe a $1,500 contribution
buys me ten minutes.

20:37.194 --> 20:39.947
It doesn't buy you anything,
but I'll give you five.

20:40.030 --> 20:42.449
-Arlene, I said the blue one.
-It had a stain.

20:42.532 --> 20:44.785
The charcoal's the ticket. Trust me.

20:44.868 --> 20:46.453
You have five minutes.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.166
So, what can I do for you?

20:52.042 --> 20:53.794
It's what I can do for you.

20:54.753 --> 20:56.463
The Wilson Fisk case.

20:56.546 --> 21:00.801
I want to provide my complete,
unmitigated, fully caffeinated support.

21:00.884 --> 21:02.135
I'm sorry, the Fisk case?

21:02.219 --> 21:04.221
I know you're doing
everything in your power

21:04.304 --> 21:06.640
to reverse the terms
of that crap deal he finagled.

21:06.723 --> 21:09.434
But you're under-resourced
and I'm over-resourced.

21:09.518 --> 21:12.604
Like, obscenely over-resourced.

21:12.688 --> 21:16.858
All this to say, I'm drafting myself
onto your team for this.

21:16.942 --> 21:18.944
So tag me the hell in.

21:21.405 --> 21:22.864
Maybe just a nod?

21:22.948 --> 21:24.783
-[chuckles] Mr. Nelson--
-Foggy.

21:24.866 --> 21:26.576
I already fought this tooth and nail.

21:26.660 --> 21:29.037
I objected to Mr. Fisk's
house incarceration

21:29.121 --> 21:30.914
on every ground imaginable.

21:30.998 --> 21:32.416
I assumed as much.

21:32.499 --> 21:35.711
So I did some digging,
and if we can open a state case,

21:35.794 --> 21:37.546
we can at least put him back behind bars.

21:37.629 --> 21:40.632
At least for a while,
which will buy us time to build--

21:40.716 --> 21:41.967
It's just not feasible.

21:42.050 --> 21:46.763
I'll do research. Late-night strategizing.
All pro bono, of course. Soup to nuts.

21:46.847 --> 21:49.391
Nelson reporting for duty, sir.

21:49.474 --> 21:51.977
Fisk is cooperating
with the federal government.

21:52.811 --> 21:54.354
There's nothing I can do.

21:54.938 --> 21:58.317
I know you know the difference
between a good fight and a losing battle.

21:58.400 --> 22:01.028
I know that sometimes
they're the same thing.

22:01.111 --> 22:03.947
And you don't know which battle
you're fighting until you're fighting it.

22:04.031 --> 22:05.240
Well, I'm moving on.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.034
You should, too.

22:07.117 --> 22:10.495
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go change for an interview.

22:10.579 --> 22:13.165
So that's it? You're just gonna roll over?

22:13.248 --> 22:16.460
No, I'm just gonna do my job.
And your five minutes are up.

22:17.419 --> 22:20.088
Would you care more
if you weren't trying to get reelected?

22:20.172 --> 22:21.381
Watch it, Counselor.

22:21.465 --> 22:23.258
Fisk had Ms. Cardenas killed.

22:24.259 --> 22:27.554
Maybe you don't give a damn,
because she's dead and can't vote for you,

22:27.637 --> 22:29.890
but she was a good person.

22:29.973 --> 22:34.686
She cared about her community,
was braver than both of us put together.

22:34.770 --> 22:37.314
Fisk will hurt more people like her.

22:38.065 --> 22:42.069
She didn't have a voice,
because the people in power didn't care.

22:42.152 --> 22:44.738
You're supposed to be
Ms. Cardenas's voice.

22:48.700 --> 22:51.411
Leave... or I'm calling security.

22:54.247 --> 22:55.582
I'm going.

22:56.541 --> 22:58.418
But I'm canceling my check.

23:01.213 --> 23:05.258
[crowd chanting] Prison, not a penthouse!
Prison, not a penthouse!

23:05.342 --> 23:07.552
[chanting continues]

23:12.182 --> 23:13.683
Chow is on the way, guys.

23:23.443 --> 23:24.945
[Dex] Mickey D's?

23:25.737 --> 23:28.740
[Doyle] You think DOJ is going to cover
$40 tuna melts for us?

23:28.824 --> 23:30.325
Just a coffee, please.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.369
[Dex] Save me something. I'm up in ten.

23:33.703 --> 23:34.955
[Doyle] Penthouse, please.

23:36.623 --> 23:39.418
-[Fisk] It's got the best view.
-[sighs]

23:40.293 --> 23:41.837
You should be rotting in a cell.

23:41.920 --> 23:44.297
So you're gonna bring me back to prison?

23:46.466 --> 23:48.260
But you know that won't work.

23:51.346 --> 23:54.474
There's only one way to stop me,
but you're not gonna do it.

23:55.559 --> 23:56.977
Are you sure about that?

23:57.644 --> 23:59.229
In a way, you're my accomplice.

23:59.312 --> 24:03.942
Everything that's happened
since you refused to kill me is on you.

24:05.235 --> 24:07.529
The bodies that I've stacked up.

24:08.822 --> 24:10.240
The ones to come.

24:11.825 --> 24:14.453
-I wonder who's next?
-[Donovan] You have the routing number.

24:15.579 --> 24:17.998
Two million. In euros.

24:18.874 --> 24:22.252
No, today. My client is not a patient man.

24:22.335 --> 24:26.256
[Fisk] You can follow him right to me.
You know you want to.

24:34.097 --> 24:36.308
-May I see your room key, sir?
-Yeah, I got it.

24:36.391 --> 24:37.767
No, I need to see it.

24:38.351 --> 24:39.769
Oh, sure. Yeah.

24:39.853 --> 24:41.688
[Fisk] You can take him. Grab his gun.

24:42.689 --> 24:45.609
Come for me. I'm caged up. Unarmed.

24:45.692 --> 24:48.570
-Sir.
-They gave me, like, three of them.

24:48.653 --> 24:49.821
[Fisk] But you won't.

24:51.406 --> 24:55.368
You can't kill me.
You can't even kill yourself.

24:57.454 --> 24:59.915
You know what?
I must have left it in my car.

24:59.998 --> 25:01.625
Then I can't let you through.

25:03.877 --> 25:05.086
Sure, I...

25:05.879 --> 25:07.339
I'll be right back.

25:14.095 --> 25:16.973
[man over PA] <i>Pharmacy service,</i>
<i>please call station four.</i>

25:17.057 --> 25:19.809
<i>Pharmacy service,</i>
<i>please call station four.</i>

25:20.936 --> 25:22.270
[woman sobbing]

25:31.363 --> 25:33.490
[woman over PA]<i> Doctor Brenner, 241.</i>

25:38.620 --> 25:40.038
[softly] I'm so sorry.

25:48.922 --> 25:50.006
Hey, boss.

25:51.841 --> 25:55.971
Andrews is back under the knife.
They think they can save his liver.

25:58.098 --> 26:00.767
Good. Good. That's good.

26:01.935 --> 26:04.854
I wanted to give blood, but...

26:05.647 --> 26:07.732
I wasn't sure if I should show my face.

26:09.109 --> 26:10.777
Nobody blames you.

26:10.860 --> 26:12.279
I blame me.

26:12.362 --> 26:13.989
Moving Fisk was my call.

26:14.573 --> 26:15.991
Because I pushed for it.

26:16.074 --> 26:18.410
Because it was the smart thing to do.

26:20.620 --> 26:22.998
Because we signed up to protect people.

26:23.832 --> 26:26.126
And this is what it looks like sometimes.

26:26.710 --> 26:29.671
Think of all the times this won't happen
because of what we're doing.

26:29.754 --> 26:32.090
Not to civilians. Not to us.

26:33.800 --> 26:36.303
Hold on to all the lives we're saving.

26:38.179 --> 26:41.933
They matter...
just as much as the one's we've lost.

26:46.688 --> 26:47.689
Yeah.

27:22.891 --> 27:24.351
<i>Bon appétit,</i> asshole.

27:29.105 --> 27:31.733
[inhales and exhales deeply]

27:38.573 --> 27:41.701
It's Special Agent Poindexter, isn't it?

27:44.371 --> 27:46.331
You saved my life last night.

27:46.414 --> 27:48.541
Yeah, we all make mistakes.

27:52.671 --> 27:55.298
I'm sorry for the loss
of your fellow agents.

27:56.883 --> 27:59.803
Losing them to protect someone like me...

28:01.137 --> 28:07.268
must be particularly difficult
for the families and the loved ones.

28:10.063 --> 28:12.148
I'd offer my condolences...

28:12.982 --> 28:16.695
but I imagine it brings them
greater comfort to hate me.

28:21.449 --> 28:23.660
Unless you feel otherwise.

28:24.577 --> 28:27.956
That my words might bring
any positive effect.

28:28.957 --> 28:32.127
If so, please share that,
from what I witnessed,

28:33.044 --> 28:35.046
they were incredibly brave.

28:35.130 --> 28:38.466
Might wanna eat faster, convict.
The meal's over in five.

28:40.135 --> 28:44.889
I owe those fallen agents a debt...

28:47.475 --> 28:48.977
that I can never repay.

28:52.981 --> 28:54.065
But...

28:57.277 --> 28:59.320
I also owe you.

29:01.823 --> 29:05.326
I've known extraordinary people.

29:06.578 --> 29:09.622
But I've never seen a talent like yours.

29:12.709 --> 29:16.838
May I ask you where you acquired
such a skill?

29:17.589 --> 29:20.175
Okay. You're done.

29:32.187 --> 29:34.189
[Dex]<i> I saved him 'cause it was my job.</i>

29:34.272 --> 29:35.857
What more do you want me to say, Doc?

29:35.940 --> 29:39.027
Forget Fisk. Talk to me about the ambush.

29:40.612 --> 29:41.821
What about it?

29:42.447 --> 29:44.741
Come on, Poindexter,
we both know how this works.

29:44.824 --> 29:47.202
We have to talk
so I can clear you for duty.

29:47.285 --> 29:48.286
It is what it is.

29:49.746 --> 29:51.289
I lost friends today.

29:51.372 --> 29:54.042
And you used lethal force
against multiple suspects.

29:54.125 --> 29:55.418
-Yeah.
-And you're on duty

29:55.502 --> 29:57.420
even though you should be
on administrative leave.

29:57.504 --> 29:59.297
I understand you're trying to do your job,

29:59.380 --> 30:02.467
but if I were wearing a mask,
the press would be calling me a hero.

30:02.550 --> 30:05.678
Instead, I'm sitting here
trying to justify protecting myself.

30:05.762 --> 30:07.972
I'm not the enemy. I'm just trying to...

30:09.224 --> 30:12.185
Look, forget the psych bullshit
for a minute.

30:12.268 --> 30:16.272
Just tell me for real, how are you?

30:22.195 --> 30:23.571
It's hard.

30:24.364 --> 30:26.074
It's really hard.

30:26.157 --> 30:29.327
This isn't the first time
you've used lethal force.

30:29.410 --> 30:33.206
I'm FBI SWAT, Doc.
What do you think a sniper does?

30:33.748 --> 30:36.876
Well, the thing is, Dex...
Can I call you Dex?

30:37.460 --> 30:41.172
The thing is,
events like this exact a toll.

30:41.256 --> 30:44.801
Repeating traumatic experiences
compounds that toll, creating a pressure.

30:44.884 --> 30:47.220
Until one day I go postal? Yeah, I get it.

30:47.303 --> 30:50.223
The point is,
you have to process this stuff.

30:50.306 --> 30:51.558
I process it.

30:51.641 --> 30:53.518
Do you have a support system?

30:54.561 --> 30:57.397
Well, I think
she'd rather be called Julie.

30:57.981 --> 31:00.692
Oh. Well, tell me, how does that work?

31:02.735 --> 31:04.153
She's a bartender.

31:04.863 --> 31:06.781
Professional listener, like you.

31:07.490 --> 31:09.033
She probably gets paid more.

31:09.117 --> 31:09.993
[chuckles]

31:11.744 --> 31:13.162
Tell me about her.

31:13.246 --> 31:15.081
We get dinner most nights.

31:15.665 --> 31:17.208
Today's Tuesday?

31:17.876 --> 31:19.002
It's pizza night.

31:19.544 --> 31:23.006
Julie gets broccoli with sausage,
extra cheese.

31:23.089 --> 31:24.716
I tell her about my day.

31:25.466 --> 31:27.051
The good, the bad.

31:27.135 --> 31:30.305
I know it's not healthy
to hold this stuff in, so...

31:30.388 --> 31:31.764
I talk to her.

31:32.473 --> 31:33.975
I tell her everything.

31:35.268 --> 31:36.144
And...

31:36.561 --> 31:39.689
And she doesn't judge me or blame me.

31:40.398 --> 31:43.276
She's just... there for me.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.529
She sounds like a good one.

31:47.947 --> 31:49.198
Yeah, she is.

31:53.369 --> 31:55.955
All right. You are clear for duty.

31:56.039 --> 32:00.501
But I want you checking in with me daily
for a while. Okay?

32:00.585 --> 32:01.836
Yes, sir.

32:02.837 --> 32:07.300
You, uh... You go see your girl.
It'll do you good.

32:22.982 --> 32:24.233
[Donovan grunts]

32:29.864 --> 32:32.158
Why did Fisk flip on the Albanians?

32:32.241 --> 32:36.204
I don't know what you're talking about.
You've got the wrong person. [gasps]

32:37.956 --> 32:41.000
Fisk hated prison. The FBI got him out.

32:41.084 --> 32:44.170
No, no. He could have turned on anyone.
Why the Albanians?

32:44.253 --> 32:45.630
I'm just a lawyer.

32:45.713 --> 32:49.926
What is Fisk really getting out of this?
Is it the Albanians' territory?

32:50.009 --> 32:51.719
-No.
-Is it money?

32:51.803 --> 32:52.804
No.

32:53.972 --> 32:56.516
Why don't you let me know
when you wanna breathe?

32:56.599 --> 32:57.976
[groans]

33:00.436 --> 33:01.854
Fisk's woman.

33:02.522 --> 33:04.273
The feds will drop
all charges against her.

33:04.357 --> 33:07.902
-No.
-I swear! He's doing it all for her.

33:08.861 --> 33:11.656
[heart beating steadily]

33:12.907 --> 33:14.242
And where is Vanessa?

33:14.325 --> 33:17.036
-[agent 1] Where you wanna eat?
-[agent 2] How about the Chinese place?

33:17.120 --> 33:19.914
-[Donovan] Help! Help!
-[agent 3] Over there! Go! Let's go!

33:19.998 --> 33:20.999
[Donovan] Help!

33:22.709 --> 33:24.210
He's an Albanian.

33:25.503 --> 33:27.964
[agent 4] There's an unidentified
assailant in the parking deck,

33:28.047 --> 33:29.757
considered armed and dangerous.

33:29.841 --> 33:30.758
[gun cocking]

33:40.685 --> 33:41.561
[grunts]

33:41.936 --> 33:43.021
[gasping]

33:43.104 --> 33:44.731
[agent 5] Anyone got a visual on him?

33:45.523 --> 33:48.317
[agent 6 over radio] <i>Nothing yet.</i>
<i>Moving to the south side of the garage.</i>

34:06.794 --> 34:07.754
[grunts]

34:20.933 --> 34:23.895
[agent 6] We're in stairwell H,
heading down to parking level three.

34:28.775 --> 34:31.027
[agent 2] We need backup
on parking level three.

34:31.110 --> 34:34.030
Repeat, we need backup
on parking level three.

34:37.116 --> 34:39.118
-[agent] Stop! FBI!
-[Matt panting]

34:39.702 --> 34:41.329
They have families, asshole.

34:41.412 --> 34:43.372
Listen. I'm not here to...

34:46.375 --> 34:47.794
[both grunting]

34:47.877 --> 34:50.963
-There he is! Stop! Stop!
-[agent] Stop!

34:51.047 --> 34:52.673
[gunshots]

34:54.133 --> 34:56.719
Come out with your hands up. Now.

34:57.553 --> 34:58.387
[grunting]

35:19.283 --> 35:20.493
Stay down, man.

35:25.832 --> 35:27.834
[panting]

35:30.837 --> 35:31.963
Oh, God.

35:33.589 --> 35:36.008
That's it. Let the Devil out.

35:46.102 --> 35:49.689
Felt good, didn't it?
Too bad you still can't get at me.

35:49.772 --> 35:51.941
Not with the FBI protecting me.

35:53.151 --> 35:57.655
I'm going to kill everyone you love,
and there's nothing you can do about it.

36:27.476 --> 36:28.811
Paper goes to bed in 20 minutes.

36:28.895 --> 36:31.063
-You got 15 seconds.
-Okay. It's big.

36:31.189 --> 36:32.607
-Shit. Fisk.
-No, look--

36:32.690 --> 36:35.318
God damn it.
I explicitly told you not to do that.

36:35.401 --> 36:37.111
-I didn't set out to.
-Stop.

36:37.195 --> 36:39.363
Mason saw you at the hotel.

36:39.906 --> 36:44.452
I mean, I know Fisk is important to you.
I know. I don't care. Okay?

36:44.535 --> 36:46.746
I assign the stories,
and I gave this one to Mason.

36:46.829 --> 36:50.291
I wasn't there on that story.
I was there on my story. Kazemis?

36:51.876 --> 36:53.628
Look, I think there's a connection.

36:54.378 --> 36:55.379
What do you mean?

36:55.463 --> 36:57.423
Do you know who used to own
the Presidential Hotel?

36:57.506 --> 36:59.133
-No.
-The Kazemis.

36:59.217 --> 37:01.969
I don't have proof yet,
but you know who I think owns it now?

37:03.054 --> 37:04.138
Wilson Fisk.

37:13.397 --> 37:15.524
-Tell me.
-Okay.

37:15.608 --> 37:17.151
Look, I got a lead.

37:17.235 --> 37:21.155
So the Presidential Hotel is owned
by these nested shell companies.

37:21.239 --> 37:23.616
It's just one company
who owns another and another...

37:23.699 --> 37:27.328
Anyway, I tracked them from here
to the Caymans to Luxembourg.

37:27.411 --> 37:28.746
And this connects to Fisk how?

37:28.829 --> 37:30.206
Because all of those companies,

37:30.289 --> 37:33.626
they're all represented here
in the United States by one law firm.

37:33.709 --> 37:35.211
Donovan and Partners.

37:36.212 --> 37:37.505
Fisk's lawyers.

37:39.548 --> 37:40.549
Okay, keep going.

37:40.633 --> 37:42.343
All right,
here's what I've pieced together.

37:42.969 --> 37:44.136
Six months ago,

37:44.220 --> 37:48.391
one of these shell companies buys
the Presidential Hotel from Kazemi.

37:48.474 --> 37:51.686
A week ago, he tells his family
that he regrets the sale

37:51.769 --> 37:54.438
and announces his intention
to buy the hotel back.

37:54.522 --> 37:56.983
And two days later, Kazemi gets attacked.

37:57.066 --> 38:00.528
Yes. Yes, exactly. Now,
I don't think that timing is coincidental.

38:00.611 --> 38:01.696
I just...

38:02.280 --> 38:05.741
I can feel Fisk is behind this.
Right? I feel it in my bones.

38:05.825 --> 38:09.287
I need two days to get everything vetted,
then I'll have a story that you can run.

38:10.621 --> 38:13.416
-It's excellent. Outstanding work, Karen.
-Thank you.

38:13.499 --> 38:14.500
Really.

38:14.583 --> 38:16.002
Yeah. [clears throat]

38:16.627 --> 38:20.589
-I'm giving it to Mason. I told you.
-What? No, I know, I'm biased.

38:20.673 --> 38:23.968
Of course! Of course I'm biased.
Fisk tried to have me killed.

38:24.051 --> 38:26.721
He also killed Ben,
which makes you as biased as me.

38:26.804 --> 38:30.349
If people see your name
and know your connection to Fisk,

38:30.433 --> 38:32.935
it compromises this paper!

38:33.019 --> 38:36.814
Fine. Give the byline to Mason.
I don't give a shit about credit.

38:36.897 --> 38:39.150
What I give a shit about
is Fisk getting out of prison.

38:39.775 --> 38:43.321
We have to do something...
I have to do something about this.

38:43.404 --> 38:45.364
So don't tell me to back off,
'cause I won't.

38:49.327 --> 38:52.913
You know, it took Ben decades
to become this much of a pain in my ass.

38:59.211 --> 39:00.046
[exhales deeply]

39:01.005 --> 39:02.256
[typing] [footsteps approaching]

39:19.148 --> 39:21.108
Well, at least you're upright.

39:27.365 --> 39:29.909
[sighs] Do I even wanna know?

39:34.163 --> 39:36.123
Do you believe people can change?

39:37.541 --> 39:39.794
I'm still holding out hope.

39:42.630 --> 39:44.131
I don’t think we can.

39:45.633 --> 39:46.717
Not really.

39:49.345 --> 39:51.847
I think we come into this world
who we are.

39:53.015 --> 39:55.142
And maybe we get a little nicer.

39:56.560 --> 39:57.978
Or a little angrier.

40:00.356 --> 40:02.858
But we can't change
our fundamental nature.

40:07.571 --> 40:10.116
[Maggie] Well, you'd actually
have to try to know.

40:10.866 --> 40:13.077
[Matt] I was talking about Wilson Fisk.

40:14.995 --> 40:17.123
So your hearing's really back, then?

40:18.040 --> 40:22.002
Well, what do you know?
Maybe the boss did hear my prayers.

40:22.962 --> 40:24.588
Yeah, or my curses.

40:24.672 --> 40:26.715
Please don't start with Job again.

40:28.467 --> 40:31.262
You gotta admit it's interesting,
though, isn't it?

40:31.345 --> 40:33.681
I finally get my full hearing back,

40:33.764 --> 40:37.101
and the first thing I hear
is that Wilson Fisk is out of prison.

40:37.726 --> 40:42.273
So you're suggesting that God set a
dangerous mobster free just to spite you?

40:45.192 --> 40:46.193
Nah.

40:47.361 --> 40:49.196
Probably just a coincidence.

40:50.030 --> 40:52.867
Because that would be
incredibly narcissistic.

40:54.952 --> 40:56.328
[Matt sniffs]

40:59.623 --> 41:02.168
Fisk claims to be helping the FBI.

41:03.085 --> 41:05.087
But they don't know him like I do.

41:05.838 --> 41:09.758
Right. And according to you,
people can't change.

41:11.385 --> 41:12.219
[sighs]

41:12.845 --> 41:15.764
'Cause he's claiming
to have changed over a woman.

41:16.432 --> 41:17.558
I see.

41:19.435 --> 41:24.023
Well, if there's anything
that can redeem a lost soul,

41:25.024 --> 41:26.609
love would have to top the list.

41:26.692 --> 41:28.777
Oh, come on. Even a monster like Fisk?

41:29.778 --> 41:31.989
You're talking to a nun, kiddo.

41:32.573 --> 41:35.117
Love and redemption
are pretty much our sales pitch.

41:35.201 --> 41:36.619
Yeah. Well, I'm not buying.

41:38.662 --> 41:40.247
So, what are you gonna do?

41:44.001 --> 41:45.169
I don't know.

41:47.922 --> 41:49.423
Maybe I'll stop him.

41:51.550 --> 41:52.843
For good this time.

41:59.183 --> 42:03.103
Well, just be careful
that you don't become the monster.

42:29.922 --> 42:31.298
[footsteps approaching]

43:04.540 --> 43:05.541
[chuckles softly]

43:42.036 --> 43:44.913
-[soft rock music playing]
-[indistinct chatter]

44:10.606 --> 44:11.649
[whispering] Foggy.

44:16.028 --> 44:17.446
This isn't real.

44:20.032 --> 44:21.033
It's real.

44:22.743 --> 44:23.577
[chuckles]

44:27.289 --> 44:28.540
Hey, Foggy.

44:29.041 --> 44:32.211
How? Where have...
We all thought you were dead.

44:33.212 --> 44:34.296
I'm sorry.

44:35.714 --> 44:38.425
-Does Karen know you're back yet?
-Take a seat.

44:40.386 --> 44:41.387
I'm...

44:42.971 --> 44:44.348
I'm not back.

44:44.973 --> 44:49.770
-Well, I'm 75% sure I'm not hallucinating.
-[clears throat] I'm, uh... not back.

44:52.022 --> 44:54.858
Matt Murdock isn't gonna be
a part of me anymore. Um...

44:55.943 --> 44:58.445
-I'm leaving him behind.
-What?

44:58.529 --> 45:02.950
The only reason I came here
was to warn you and Karen...

45:03.826 --> 45:06.328
that Fisk is out
and you're both in danger. -Dude--
-I've had a rough couple of months, Foggy.

45:10.124 --> 45:11.500
Questioning a lot of...

45:13.752 --> 45:15.045
The point of it all.

45:16.964 --> 45:19.341
And last night, everything became clear.

45:21.343 --> 45:25.431
I'm going after him, Foggy.
I'm gonna find a way to bring Fisk down.

45:25.514 --> 45:28.058
But I can only do that
if I know you and Karen are safe.

45:28.142 --> 45:29.852
[chuckles] Dude, slow down.

45:29.935 --> 45:32.813
I'm still processing that you're,
like, even sitting here.

45:32.896 --> 45:34.815
I know you're gonna want to get involved.

45:35.858 --> 45:38.986
You and Karen will try and fight Fisk
in some way.

45:39.069 --> 45:40.154
I'm telling you,

45:40.946 --> 45:43.741
I need you to stay out of it
and leave it to me.

45:46.910 --> 45:47.911
No.

45:49.496 --> 45:51.123
-"No"?
-[firmly] No.

45:52.082 --> 45:54.585
You don't get to show up like this
and say something like that

45:54.668 --> 45:56.628
and expect me to be cool with it.

45:57.504 --> 46:01.467
-You're my best friend, asshole.
-I see I was wrong to become your friend.

46:02.593 --> 46:05.888
I... I put you in danger,
and it was selfish of me.

46:06.638 --> 46:10.350
I can't change the past,
but I can stop making the same mistake.

46:12.311 --> 46:15.355
We're done, buddy. It's, uh... It's over.

46:15.939 --> 46:18.233
There's something
seriously wrong with you.

46:19.318 --> 46:20.778
Yeah, I know.

46:20.861 --> 46:23.530
Stay clear of Fisk.
Tell Karen to do the same. And I'd appreciate it
if you didn't tell her you saw me.

46:26.950 --> 46:29.453
-Do you even hear yourself right now?
-Goodbye, Foggy.

46:29.536 --> 46:31.205
Matt! Matt!

46:32.164 --> 46:33.290
[door opens]

46:35.125 --> 46:36.168
[door closes

46:59.525 --> 47:00.984
Was it him?

47:01.068 --> 47:02.861
He took out six feds.

47:02.945 --> 47:06.365
He wasn't in a red suit,
but, yeah, it was him.

47:15.874 --> 47:17.918
So the Devil is back.
