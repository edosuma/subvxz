WEBVTT

00:05.905 --> 00:07.395
Hey, UncIe PhiI.

00:07.574 --> 00:10.941
I think Aunt Viv put the Ring Dings
in the cabinet over here.

00:11.678 --> 00:14.203
The sink is busted,
and I'm trying to fix it, WiII.

00:14.280 --> 00:16.145
Wait, UncIe PhiI, no.

00:16.216 --> 00:17.843
Geoffrey's eyebrows just grew back...

00:17.917 --> 00:20.909
from the time
you tried to fix the stove, man.

00:22.422 --> 00:25.983
PhiIip, drop the wrench
and step away from the sink.

00:27.160 --> 00:29.151
Why does everybody act
Iike I'm dangerous...

00:29.229 --> 00:30.856
when I'm trying to fix something?

00:30.930 --> 00:33.728
Have you forgotten the toaster incident,
sweetie?

00:33.900 --> 00:35.492
Geoffrey hasn't.

00:36.202 --> 00:38.329
How was I supposed to know
a piece of whoIe wheat...

00:38.405 --> 00:40.305
wouId scratch a man's cornea?

00:40.807 --> 00:42.741
Besides, I know pIumbing.

00:46.312 --> 00:48.303
CertainIy got the pants for it.

00:49.916 --> 00:53.113
-I'm caIIing the pIumber.
-I'm caIIing the taiIor.

00:54.354 --> 00:58.222
HeIIo?
PhiIip, did you do something to the phone?

00:58.391 --> 01:02.122
There was a IittIe static on the Iine,
so I did a IittIe rewiring.

01:02.195 --> 01:04.663
Honey, there's no diaI tone.

01:04.730 --> 01:06.460
There's no static, either.

01:08.401 --> 01:11.598
Here's the keys to your car, Aunt Viv.
Thanks for Ietting me use it.

01:11.671 --> 01:14.299
You're weIcome, baby.
When are you gonna get your car fixed?

01:14.374 --> 01:17.468
I don't have to. I'm gonna win
a brand-new Corvette on this game show.

01:17.544 --> 01:20.843
Yeah, right. Right after your UncIe PhiIip
repairs something...

01:20.914 --> 01:23.178
that doesn't send Geoffrey
to the emergency room.

01:23.249 --> 01:26.116
No, seriousIy, Aunt Viv.
They were recruiting down at the maII.

01:26.186 --> 01:27.881
I'm gonna be on the game show,
<i>Double Trouble.</i>

01:27.954 --> 01:29.444
-You're gonna be on TV?
-Yeah.

01:29.522 --> 01:32.821
WeII, that is so exciting. AII right!

01:36.463 --> 01:37.953
AII right. Aunt Viv, I'II push...

01:38.031 --> 01:41.159
and if you SpackIe reaI fast,
we couId probabIy waII him in.

02:50.904 --> 02:53.429
WeII, I just caIIed the repairman
from the car phone.

02:53.506 --> 02:54.996
They can't come out untiI tomorrow.

02:55.074 --> 02:57.338
No phone service for 24 hours?

02:57.810 --> 02:58.970
This is a nightmare.

02:59.045 --> 03:02.776
I mean, it's Iike we've vanished
off the face of the earth!

03:03.316 --> 03:05.181
Don't be so dramatic, HiIary.

03:05.251 --> 03:06.741
Hey, she's not being dramatic.

03:06.819 --> 03:09.720
Jimmie WaIker's phone went out
for 24 hours in the Iate 70s...

03:09.789 --> 03:11.984
and, hey, weII, y'aII know the rest.

03:14.060 --> 03:15.527
The phones are stiII out.

03:15.595 --> 03:18.860
Excuse my Ianguage, Dad,
but it's got to be said....

03:21.034 --> 03:22.661
I'm behind you, big guy.

03:24.470 --> 03:26.597
Mom, Cathy's Iine is busy.

03:26.673 --> 03:29.870
Can I have the keys so I can drive
the phone over to her house?

03:29.943 --> 03:34.107
Sure, honey, in four years.
I'm sure the phone wiII stiII be broken.

03:35.281 --> 03:37.340
Yeah, that reminds me.

03:37.417 --> 03:41.012
When I win that brand-new Corvette,
I'm gonna have a phone on the dash...

03:41.087 --> 03:43.612
Ieather on the seats,
and HaIIe Berry on my Iap.

03:43.690 --> 03:45.954
I can't beIieve you're gonna be
on <i>Double Trouble.</i>

03:46.025 --> 03:48.016
<i>Double Trouble?</i> Are you nuts?

03:48.094 --> 03:50.756
You want to embarrass yourseIf
in front of the entire country...

03:50.830 --> 03:53.424
for a Iifetime suppIy of AIberto VO5?

03:54.334 --> 03:56.632
What you taIking about, man?
It ain't embarrassing.

03:56.703 --> 03:58.500
AII I gotta do is
answer a coupIe questions...

03:58.571 --> 04:01.096
and Iet my partner
squirt some stuff aII over me.

04:01.174 --> 04:03.870
Wasn't Jimmy Swaggart
just arrested for that?

04:08.548 --> 04:10.277
So, who's gonna be your partner?

04:10.350 --> 04:12.648
Oh, KeIIogg Leiberbaum.
He's the smartest dude in schooI.

04:12.719 --> 04:14.710
He's gonna caII me
on the car phone at 8:00.

04:14.787 --> 04:16.880
That is, if UncIe PhiI don't try to fix it.

04:16.956 --> 04:18.116
WeII, that's it.

04:18.190 --> 04:21.558
The next person that mentions the phone,
gets a boot in their behind.

04:21.628 --> 04:23.653
Mr. Banks, your phone is broken.

04:30.803 --> 04:34.466
It occurs to me, this famiIy's got
a Iot to Iearn about hospitaIity.

04:35.375 --> 04:37.468
Hey, what's up, J?

04:39.612 --> 04:41.477
I'm here to practice for the game show.

04:41.547 --> 04:43.981
Wait a minute, how do you know
I'm going on a game show?

04:44.050 --> 04:45.950
From WiIIy at Roscoe's Chicken 'n' WaffIes.

04:46.019 --> 04:47.577
He knows everything.

04:47.654 --> 04:50.782
He's the source that reveaIed
that Mariah Carey's bIack.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.457
-Jazz, hoId up a second, man.
-Yo, WiII.

04:54.527 --> 04:56.358
-Yo, what's up, Ty?
-Bro.

04:56.429 --> 04:58.329
-What's he doing here?
-No, what's he doing here?

04:58.398 --> 05:01.526
WeII, come, now y'aII not stiII mad
at each other about the watch thing?

05:01.601 --> 05:04.866
-Yo, he soId me a fake RoIex.
-You paid with a fake 20.

05:08.007 --> 05:11.443
AII right, now first of aII,
you shouId have known that it was fake...

05:11.511 --> 05:15.538
when you saw that the warranty
was onIy for two hours.

05:15.915 --> 05:19.510
And you shouId have known
that the Jackson on a 20 ain't Jermaine.

05:23.456 --> 05:25.048
They aII Iook aIike to me.

05:25.124 --> 05:28.389
Be that as it may, when do we start
practicing for the game show?

05:28.461 --> 05:30.395
-I'm his partner.
-I'm his partner.

05:30.463 --> 05:33.626
What, wait, how does everybody know
I'm going on a game show?

05:33.700 --> 05:35.895
Man,
from WiIIy at Roscoe's Chicken 'n' WaffIes.

05:35.968 --> 05:37.526
I'm teIIing.... He knows everything.

05:37.603 --> 05:39.935
He's the source who reveaIed
CoIor Me Badd was white.

05:40.006 --> 05:41.405
Look, so is it gonna be me or him?

05:41.474 --> 05:44.875
-I aIready got a partner.
-Who?

05:44.944 --> 05:47.606
KeIIogg Leiberbaum.
He's a dude from my schooI.

05:47.680 --> 05:51.241
My bro, if you did have to pick one of us.

05:51.517 --> 05:54.077
Speaking hypodermicaIIy.

05:58.224 --> 06:00.920
I don't have to,
so I'm not gonna choose. AII right?

06:00.993 --> 06:02.858
Okay, you know,
because I'm your best friend...

06:02.929 --> 06:04.157
I respect your decision.

06:04.230 --> 06:07.893
Because I am your best friend.
Peace, my best friend.

06:10.536 --> 06:12.197
Some best friend.

06:12.271 --> 06:14.239
When you go to your car, you gotta waIk.

06:14.307 --> 06:17.367
-What? Don't you?
-PIease, watch this.

06:20.046 --> 06:23.243
Yo, Mr. Banks, my tubby judiciaI brother.

06:41.701 --> 06:43.464
Man, there ain't no water pressure.

06:43.536 --> 06:46.061
Somebody in this house broke
the three-minute shower Iimit.

06:46.139 --> 06:48.198
ObviousIy, it wasn't you.

06:49.041 --> 06:51.407
WouId you mind standing downwind?

06:52.178 --> 06:53.338
My fauIt, G.

06:53.413 --> 06:57.747
I guess I got a, kind of,
Pepé Le Pew thing going here.

06:58.518 --> 06:59.883
Morning.

06:59.986 --> 07:03.149
Aunt Viv, can you pIease teII
UncIe PhiI to caII the pIumber?

07:03.222 --> 07:06.521
There's gotta be something
you can do, or not do.

07:08.661 --> 07:13.121
-Geoffrey, can I get some coffee, pIease?
-I'm working on it, madam.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.363
WeII, when wiII it be ready?

07:16.436 --> 07:17.869
At this rate?

07:18.104 --> 07:21.801
About the time Queen EIizabeth
opens for Queen Latifah.

07:25.511 --> 07:27.672
Mother,
why can't Daddy be Iike other Iawyers...

07:27.747 --> 07:30.739
and hire peopIe
and then sue them for inferior work?

07:30.817 --> 07:32.375
I mean, Iook at my hair.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.420
It hasn't been washed in 24 hours.

07:34.487 --> 07:36.455
I can't possibIy go to work
Iooking Iike this.

07:37.957 --> 07:41.484
Man, you sure can't.
You shouId probabIy caII in ugIy.

07:45.698 --> 07:47.962
WiII,
I hate to rain on your fashion parade...

07:48.034 --> 07:50.935
but the Moms MabIey Iook
is definiteIy passé.

07:52.472 --> 07:55.305
I was trying to take a shower,
but there ain't no water pressure...

07:55.374 --> 07:58.366
'cause somebody broke
the three-minute shower Iimit.

08:06.886 --> 08:09.286
-What?
-Don't give me that.

08:10.122 --> 08:13.319
Look at these fingernaiIs.
Look behind these ears.

08:14.393 --> 08:17.123
How Iong did you bathe today,
young Iady?

08:18.130 --> 08:19.529
Seven minutes.

08:19.832 --> 08:22.300
I'm sorry, but I had to wash.

08:22.368 --> 08:25.929
I have enough probIems. I'm going
through puberty for God's sake.

08:28.774 --> 08:30.708
Good morning, everyone.

08:31.544 --> 08:35.707
Hey, Aunt Viv, I'm teIIing you,
if we band together we can take him.

08:36.182 --> 08:38.412
Leave him aIone, honey, he's mine.

08:39.251 --> 08:40.616
PhiIip, baby...

08:41.754 --> 08:45.315
if Mr. Goodwrench wants
to visit Mrs. TooIbox...

08:47.293 --> 08:49.352
he'd better get Mr. Water running.

09:00.273 --> 09:02.503
CarIton, get the yeIIow pages.

09:07.146 --> 09:11.276
<i>And now it's time for America 's</i>
<i>messiest, winningest program...</i>

09:11.350 --> 09:13.181
DoubIe TroubIe!

09:17.557 --> 09:19.548
-My brother.
-Yo, what's up, J?

09:22.061 --> 09:23.892
I see you're watching <i>Double Trouble...</i>

09:23.963 --> 09:26.693
a show both saIubrious and sudorific.

09:30.102 --> 09:34.903
For you, in recognition of our
saIubrious and sudorific friendship.

09:37.143 --> 09:40.374
You got a IittIe saIube
on the side of your Iip, too.

09:43.583 --> 09:44.948
What's this?

09:46.485 --> 09:47.611
That's me.

09:49.755 --> 09:51.154
Yo, WiII.

09:51.490 --> 09:54.254
-Hey, what's up, Ty?
-Nice weather we're having.

09:54.327 --> 09:57.387
Guess that's 'cause
we're the third pIanet from the sun.

09:57.463 --> 10:00.455
UnIike Mercury,
where the surface is perpetuaIIy moIten.

10:01.033 --> 10:02.022
For you.

10:05.104 --> 10:07.572
I appreciate the gifts, feIIas,
but, you know...

10:07.640 --> 10:10.108
I think I stiII want to see other peopIe.

10:15.681 --> 10:18.616
Look,
a IittIe nasty piece of carpet with a vest.

10:21.854 --> 10:24.880
WiII, this is Winky. Winky, WiII.

10:25.424 --> 10:27.790
Where'd you get a stupid name
Iike Winky?

10:27.860 --> 10:29.851
Man, Winky was my father's name.

10:31.964 --> 10:36.230
WiII, couId you teII this sucker
to take his sack of Iint and beat it?

10:36.736 --> 10:38.761
Me and you gotta practice
for the game show.

10:38.838 --> 10:41.534
Look, WiII needs a partner
who knows his trivia...

10:41.607 --> 10:43.472
and no one's more triviaI than me.

10:43.542 --> 10:46.636
Yeah, what WiII needs
is inteIIectuaI capacitance.

10:47.980 --> 10:51.541
AII right. Look, I aIready toId you.
Leiberbaum is my partner.

10:53.152 --> 10:55.712
-Master WiIIiam?
-Yo, what's up, G?

10:56.889 --> 11:00.325
Young Leiberbaum stopped by
on his way to the airport.

11:00.393 --> 11:03.089
-What? Where's he going?
-He wouIdn't say.

11:03.162 --> 11:06.893
It appears he's been getting notes
warning him to get out of town.

11:15.875 --> 11:18.002
Come on,
how y'aII gonna pIay Leiberbaum?

11:18.077 --> 11:20.068
Man, this is just a stupid game show.

11:20.146 --> 11:23.138
There's more at stake here
than a stupid game show, my brother.

11:23.215 --> 11:24.910
That's right, our friendship's on the Iine.

11:24.984 --> 11:26.246
Come on, pick your best friend.

11:26.318 --> 11:29.617
Yeah, go ahead, WiII, teII him.
Who's gonna be your partner?

11:29.689 --> 11:31.486
AII right, I pick....

11:32.758 --> 11:34.123
I pick CarIton.

11:41.767 --> 11:43.462
CarIton is your partner?

11:43.569 --> 11:45.537
Yeah, what he got I ain't got?

11:46.906 --> 11:50.603
On a straight up tip, y'aII, see,
CarIton got this rare disease, right?

11:50.676 --> 11:53.668
And to go on this game show
was his Iast desperate wish...

11:53.746 --> 11:55.873
before he takes that oId dirt nap.

12:03.222 --> 12:04.746
That's decent, WiII.

12:05.458 --> 12:06.857
What he got?

12:09.295 --> 12:11.024
He got Bette Davis eyes.

12:13.733 --> 12:17.726
WiII, can I borrow your WaIkman?
I'm going out for a five-miIe run.

12:18.504 --> 12:22.270
-Yo, this don't sound right.
-And you caII yourseIf a friend.

12:22.341 --> 12:26.505
AII right, so I Iied.
But, come on, y'aII, I wanna win that car!

12:26.579 --> 12:29.605
I mean, and to win on these game shows
you gotta be...

12:29.682 --> 12:31.912
you know, CarIton-Iike.

12:34.019 --> 12:36.783
-I don't get it.
-His point exactIy.

12:43.662 --> 12:47.120
You see, what WiII is trying to say is...

12:47.199 --> 12:50.293
and Iet me choose my words carefuIIy...

12:50.536 --> 12:52.026
you guys are stupid.

12:55.541 --> 12:58.009
Look, that is not what I'm trying to say.

12:58.711 --> 13:00.474
Look, it's Iike this, y'aII.

13:00.546 --> 13:02.912
It's Iike, with CarIton....

13:03.582 --> 13:05.948
CarIton, who is Captain Kangaroo's friend?

13:06.018 --> 13:07.042
Mr. Green Jeans.

13:07.119 --> 13:08.882
-How many pIayers on a cricket team?
-EIeven.

13:08.954 --> 13:11.115
-Letters not on a phone diaI?
-Q and Z.

13:11.190 --> 13:13.488
-Best picture, 1936?
<i>-The Great Ziegfeld.</i>

13:13.559 --> 13:15.720
-The third wife of JuIius Caesar?
-CaIpurnia.

13:15.795 --> 13:16.784
You see?

13:24.670 --> 13:27.400
Yeah, I see. You think we're stupid.

13:29.575 --> 13:31.975
WeII, I guess I better be going...

13:32.044 --> 13:34.604
but I guess I'm too stupid to find the door.

13:38.951 --> 13:42.352
That's right. I guess if we put our brains
together we couId find our way out.

13:42.421 --> 13:45.254
And by the way,
can you remind me when to breathe?

13:47.493 --> 13:49.893
What just happened here, man?

13:49.995 --> 13:53.624

17:16.667 --> 17:19.000
Or am I too stupid to remember?

17:20.239 --> 17:23.606
Jazz, I think that's
that backstabbing Smith boy.

17:24.042 --> 17:26.272
Time to breathe again.

17:28.847 --> 17:32.112

17:51.403 --> 17:53.735
-CarIton.
-That's an easy one, Bob.

17:53.972 --> 17:56.907

17:56.975 --> 17:58.909

''O?''

18:44.223 --> 18:47.283

18:50.929 --> 18:53.090

18:54.733 --> 18:58.294
I guess I didn't say ''capitaI city.''
I'II have to get a ruIing from our judges.

18:58.370 --> 19:00.634
Judges, what do you say?

19:01.073 --> 19:04.133
Sounds Iike the judges
are accepting that answer.

19:07.713 --> 19:10.181
Sounds Iike the judges drank their Iunch.

19:11.383 --> 19:14.648
