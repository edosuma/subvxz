- What a blessing.
- It is a blessing, truly.

10:15.621 --> 10:18.589
Man, it is a wasteland out there, okay?

10:18.614 --> 10:19.757
We're talking extinction.

10:19.792 --> 10:21.958
- (sighs)
- (sighs) This is horrible.

10:21.993 --> 10:24.961
Philip, the church extends their
condolences.

10:24.996 --> 10:28.264
Thank you for your wife and child
who have perished. Very sad.

10:28.299 --> 10:31.668
It was my partner, so it wasn't my
wife, but I do appreciate that.

10:31.703 --> 10:33.603
- Thank you, Father.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

10:33.638 --> 10:36.539
Thank you, Mary. But you know,
we've all lost people, so...

10:36.575 --> 10:38.674
Sorry. You know, I will... I will say,

10:38.709 --> 10:41.128
Kind of have been
calling this for a while, so.

10:41.152 --> 10:42.612
(scoffs) I'm sorry, what?

10:42.613 --> 10:46.414
Just the whole thing that if we don't
all collectively repent for our sins,

10:46.450 --> 10:49.280
an act of God like this
was very likely, so...

10:49.305 --> 10:51.108
- Are you kidding me, dude?
- Are you serious right now?

10:51.133 --> 10:53.755
When we have women roaches giving birth

10:53.791 --> 10:56.723
- to fatherless roach babies...
- Have you lost your mind?

10:56.748 --> 10:57.975
- I've not lost my mind...
- You know what?

10:58.000 --> 11:00.368
You need to hold me back
because I'll honestly...

11:00.392 --> 11:02.358
- I'm trying not to...
- Oh, and don't get me started

11:02.383 --> 11:05.833
on two boy roaches
kissing each other! Ew!

11:05.869 --> 11:07.635
You listen to me, motherfucker!

11:07.670 --> 11:10.571
I lost the love of my life
back there and my child!

11:10.607 --> 11:12.338
- You got that?
- (grunting) Get off me!

11:12.374 --> 11:14.340
(door thuds)

11:14.376 --> 11:16.109
- Knock it off.
- (gasping) God.

11:16.144 --> 11:17.410
Stop dry-humping each other.

11:17.445 --> 11:20.096
- We're not dry humping each other.
- Get a hold of yourself.

11:20.121 --> 11:21.199
Who is... Who are you?

11:21.223 --> 11:23.223
That's Graham. He's been
around here forever.

11:23.251 --> 11:24.991
He's like the De facto leader, I guess.

11:25.016 --> 11:26.920
(assertively) No. I'm Graham.

11:26.955 --> 11:29.287
I've been around here forever,
and I'm the De facto leader.

11:29.323 --> 11:30.823
- That's... I just said that.
- Okay, great.

11:30.858 --> 11:32.958
You want to survive,
you gotta get the tone right.

11:32.994 --> 11:34.593
Now, look, we're alive.

11:34.629 --> 11:37.029
I don't know why, but,
damn it, we're still here.

11:37.064 --> 11:40.038
That cloud, that thing, whatever it was,

11:40.063 --> 11:41.800
it's destroyed our civilization.

11:41.836 --> 11:45.603
If we want to survive,
we must leave the wall.

11:45.639 --> 11:49.373
(sputtering) Leave the wall?
Is that what I just heard.

11:49.409 --> 11:52.010
Graham, there's nothing
outside of the wall.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.445
Have you forgotten
what is in God's Good Book?

11:54.480 --> 11:56.748
Is anyone else seeing
a problem with this?

11:56.783 --> 11:58.482
- No.
- I'm not.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.000
I think you're kind of on
your own there, buddy.

12:00.024 --> 12:01.932
- Wow...
- Graham, I'm Phil by the way.

12:01.957 --> 12:03.690
- It's nice to meet you. Great.
- Good to meet you.

12:03.715 --> 12:05.923
- I've seen you around, I think.
- Yeah, do you work out at the Y?

12:05.958 --> 12:07.837
- I have before, yes.
- Oh cool! Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:07.862 --> 12:10.226
I think I've seen you like
in the gym and stuff like that.

12:10.262 --> 12:13.229
So who's in, and who's dead?

12:14.433 --> 12:15.799
I'm in.

12:15.834 --> 12:17.968
I want my child to have
a life without fear,

12:18.003 --> 12:21.503
and if that life is outside
of the wall, well, so be it.

12:21.539 --> 12:22.905
I'm in too.

12:22.941 --> 12:25.274
Father? What do you say?

12:26.444 --> 12:28.477
You'd better be right.

12:30.147 --> 12:31.681
(grunting)

12:31.716 --> 12:33.515
Mary: Oh, shit.

12:33.551 --> 12:37.786
- Oh, my God. What is this?
- Holy shit.

12:37.821 --> 12:40.354
This is incredible.
This has been here all along.

12:40.390 --> 12:41.556
My God.

12:41.592 --> 12:43.733
Hey, Phil, do you recall...

12:43.758 --> 12:45.894
- ...that time Sister Mike over here
- Mm-hmm.

12:45.929 --> 12:47.729
said there was nothing outside the wall?

12:47.764 --> 12:49.263
- I do remember that!
- You know what?

12:49.299 --> 12:51.032
First of all, it's Father Mike, okay?

12:51.068 --> 12:53.468
It's not Sister Mike, and I
don't appreciate that, Mary.

12:53.503 --> 12:55.069
Oh, I'm so sorry.

12:55.104 --> 12:56.971
You are forgiven. I will pray for you.

12:57.006 --> 12:58.338
- Sister Mike.
- You know what...

12:58.373 --> 13:01.742
By the way, this is only about
one-quarter of what's out there.

13:01.777 --> 13:04.478
- Whoa, dude.
- Yeah, that's what some experts believe.

13:04.513 --> 13:09.116
Okay, follow me. Stay low and
stay close, like a... fanny pack.

13:09.151 --> 13:12.485
Let's try to walk single file.
Yeah, single file, not double...

13:12.520 --> 13:14.899
- Mike, get behind me.
- I just like being by his side.

13:14.924 --> 13:16.522
I know, but you're fucking,
you're throwing off...

13:16.557 --> 13:18.190
He was there first. You get behind him.

13:18.226 --> 13:19.458
Me get behind him?

13:19.494 --> 13:21.460
- Mary, why don't you come to the front?
- Thank you so much.

13:21.496 --> 13:22.662
Mary gets everything!

13:22.697 --> 13:24.997
- She's pregnant!
- Fine!

13:26.034 --> 13:28.299
(sniffs) Okay, that way is north.

13:28.335 --> 13:30.613
He could tell that
from the shit on the shoe?

13:30.638 --> 13:32.738
This guy needs like
a reality show or something.

13:32.762 --> 13:33.740
Yeah, I would watch that.

13:33.741 --> 13:37.575
- (water whooshing)
- Wow. That is beautiful.

13:38.846 --> 13:40.145
Step back.

13:41.214 --> 13:42.114
(grunts)

13:42.149 --> 13:44.215
- Wow! Cool.
- That was good.

13:44.251 --> 13:46.784
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm great. That didn't hurt.

13:46.819 --> 13:48.318
Can I get a minute alone, please?

13:48.343 --> 13:50.543
- Oh. Sure, yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

13:50.589 --> 13:53.157
Fuck. (exhales)

13:53.993 --> 13:56.226
Okay. I'm good. Let's go.

13:56.262 --> 13:59.263
What I saw up in that wall,
you don't want to know.

13:59.298 --> 14:01.998
I lost a lot of guys. Good guys.

14:02.034 --> 14:04.333
Couple shitty guys. They were all guys.

14:04.369 --> 14:06.936
- Oh, my God.
- And back then I was jacked.

14:06.972 --> 14:09.688
You're pretty jacked still.
You got that old dude jacked.

14:09.713 --> 14:11.941
Yeah. That's all right. I'm not fishing
for that, but thank you.

14:11.977 --> 14:13.677
What was your career? What'd you do?

14:13.712 --> 14:16.046
- I was a lifestyle blogger.
- So cool.

14:16.081 --> 14:17.580
Yeah, I've seen a lot of shit.

14:17.615 --> 14:19.481
And I've blogged about even more of it.

14:19.516 --> 14:23.118
- (laughing) Whoa, check it out! It's cool!
- (Mary laughing)

14:23.154 --> 14:27.589
Guys, that's really cute,
but we should be moving.

14:27.624 --> 14:28.924
Okay? Enough fun and games.

14:28.959 --> 14:31.026
Come on, Graham, get up here! Come on!

14:31.062 --> 14:34.163
Graham don't be such a wet blanket.
Say yes to the moment.

14:34.198 --> 14:35.797
You're worthy of having fun.

14:35.832 --> 14:37.264
Drink deeply from the cup of life.

14:37.300 --> 14:39.633
Okay. Just for a minute.

14:39.669 --> 14:41.836
(affectless) Haha. Wee. Ha.

14:41.871 --> 14:43.491
Yeah. I see the appeal.

14:43.516 --> 14:45.858
- Don't push me.
- No one's pushing you, Mike.

14:45.883 --> 14:48.366
You guys are kind of being
a little rough. Relax, dude.

14:48.391 --> 14:51.445
This is good. This is a good plot point
for us before our threat arrives.

14:51.480 --> 14:53.513
You guys are my best friends.

14:53.548 --> 14:55.148
- (thuds)
- What was that?

14:55.184 --> 14:56.917
- What the fuck was that, dude?
- Oh, my God.

14:56.952 --> 14:59.385
He's here.

14:59.410 --> 15:01.010
- Oh shit, dude.
- Stay calm.

15:01.056 --> 15:02.388
Here's what we're gonna do.

15:02.424 --> 15:04.024
Follow me. No one's gonna panic.

15:04.059 --> 15:05.258
- (thudding)
- Run!

15:05.283 --> 15:07.650
- Go, now!
- Go! Go! Go! Go!

15:07.696 --> 15:08.729
Graham up!

15:08.764 --> 15:10.763
(grunting)

15:15.103 --> 15:17.136
Okay. I think we're safe
under here for now.

15:17.171 --> 15:19.138
Is everyone here, did we all make it?

15:19.173 --> 15:20.873
- (grunting)
- (squishing)

15:20.908 --> 15:23.508
(muttering) No. Stupid Graham.

15:23.544 --> 15:24.977
That's what happens when you look up.

15:25.012 --> 15:27.545
- You happy? Are you happy?
- What's going on?

15:27.580 --> 15:31.551
Well, it seems as though I've found myself
in quite the sticky situation. (chuckles)

15:31.576 --> 15:33.618
Graham. Graham, Jesus Christ, dude,
don't move or anything...

15:33.653 --> 15:36.221
- Okay? We'll just go ahead and can just...
- No, it's no big deal.

15:36.256 --> 15:38.156
- Let me just push off.
- Okay.

15:38.191 --> 15:40.524
- Holy shit, dude! Just stop! Stop!
- (screams)

15:40.560 --> 15:41.790
- What the fuck?
- Just let me... - No!

15:41.815 --> 15:43.994
- Did his fucking arm just rip off?
- Oh, my God!

15:44.029 --> 15:45.558
No. He's fine. He's fine. Okay?

15:45.582 --> 15:47.439
- Everyone just remain calm, dude.
- His fucking arm just ripped off.

15:47.464 --> 15:49.004
- Mike, fucking chill, dude.
- Phil.

15:49.028 --> 15:51.445
- You're not helping.
- Phil. Phil, come close, buddy.

15:51.470 --> 15:52.770
What is it, buddy?

15:52.805 --> 15:55.005
I'm glad we're, like, on buddy terms now.
This feels good.

15:55.040 --> 15:56.940
Lead those two to freedom.

15:56.976 --> 16:00.304
Find a crack, find a window,
find a hole,

16:00.329 --> 16:02.444
anything, get yourselves out.

16:02.472 --> 16:04.205
- Graham...
- Am I understood?

16:04.249 --> 16:06.348
What the fuck are you talking about?
We're not gonna leave...

16:06.384 --> 16:07.884
Just shut up and listen to me, okay?

16:07.919 --> 16:09.062
There's no hope for me,

16:09.087 --> 16:11.053
and I'll be damned
if I take you all down too.

16:11.089 --> 16:13.722
- I want you to reach in my bag...
- Okay.

16:13.758 --> 16:16.358
Inside, there's some gum.

16:16.394 --> 16:17.793
Okay, cool.

16:17.828 --> 16:19.795
Behind that, there's a gun.

16:19.830 --> 16:23.064
- I can't... Okay.
- Take the gum and put it in my mouth.

16:23.100 --> 16:26.470
And then take the gun
and put it in my mouth.

16:26.495 --> 16:29.400
- No, dude. That's where I draw the line...
- Come on, you pussy.

16:29.425 --> 16:30.339
I can't fucking do it...

16:30.363 --> 16:32.148
Were you this scared when you
couldn't save your daughter? Huh?

16:32.173 --> 16:33.759
- Fuck you, Graham!
- Or your fucking ex-husband

16:33.784 --> 16:36.143
- who couldn't love you?
- Fuck you, Graham! Fuck you!

16:36.179 --> 16:39.246
- What, is that an ankle bracelet?
- What about it?

16:39.271 --> 16:41.358
- Are you for real with that thing?
- Yes, dude!

16:41.383 --> 16:43.717
- You're serious? Cute?
- It's cute.

16:43.718 --> 16:45.810
Yeah, I got it in Cancun. It was
like a friends-cation sort of thing.

16:45.835 --> 16:46.741
Look at yourself.

16:46.766 --> 16:48.898
Thanksgiving, 'cause a lot of us
don't have family in the city.

16:48.923 --> 16:49.857
You really don't like it?

16:49.892 --> 16:52.792
Kill me the way that ankle bracelet
kills anyone's libido who looks at you.

16:52.828 --> 16:54.493
That really hurts because
I know the other stuff is

16:54.529 --> 16:56.529
- just goading me...
- Everybody thinks it looks ridiculous.

16:56.554 --> 16:58.955
- Who said that, Mary? I can't.
- Phil, shoot me!

16:59.000 --> 17:01.100
- Fucking pull the trigger!
- I can't fucking do it, Graham.

17:01.136 --> 17:03.336
Fuck you, do it.

17:03.371 --> 17:04.804
(gasps)

17:04.839 --> 17:08.374
We don't have time to play games.

17:08.398 --> 17:10.068
My baby needs a home.

17:10.093 --> 17:11.579
And wipe my prints off the gun.

17:11.603 --> 17:12.788
Don't fucking check and come at me...

17:12.789 --> 17:15.146
I mean, but, honestly, my ankle
bracelet is cool, right?

17:15.182 --> 17:17.915
Like he was just saying that
to like get me to shoot him?

17:17.952 --> 17:19.117
Just sucks.

17:51.016 --> 17:52.515
other than the birds I'm stuck to.

17:52.550 --> 17:55.285
After college, I took up with this V

17:55.320 --> 17:57.881
- that was heading all the way south...
- Oh, my God.

17:57.906 --> 17:59.616
- ...like into Mexico.
- That is so lucky.

17:59.641 --> 18:01.125
- Yeah, it was really fortunate.
- I wanted to do that,

18:01.149 --> 18:02.225
my parents wouldn't let me.

18:02.226 --> 18:04.088
And I just got a whole

Oh God. I'm so sorry.

- Oh.
- This is my friend Geoff.

18:06.630 --> 18:08.030
- Oh, hi!
- And your name?

- I don't know...
- This is nice.

18:13.323 --> 18:15.171
How would someone
know that if they weren't

18:15.172 --> 18:16.772
listening in beforehand.

18:16.807 --> 18:19.640
Uh, it's so crazy.
I just met this girl Ashley

18:19.675 --> 18:23.477
out of the blue and...
I'm happy, I'm a happy guy.

18:23.513 --> 18:25.023
Oh, can I give you a hug?

Hi. What did you say your name was?

18:27.617 --> 18:29.117
- I've been quiet for long enough.
- I'm Ashley.

18:29.152 --> 18:30.518
- I'm Diana.
- Oh, my gosh.

18:30.553 --> 18:31.819
I'm Chuck and this is Dan.

18:31.854 --> 18:33.354
We're the cool guys
of the group. Okay, bye.

18:33.390 --> 18:35.522
- What is happening?
- Ashley, uh, look,

18:35.557 --> 18:37.824
I maybe didn't share with you
everything about me...

18:37.859 --> 18:38.792
- You didn't!
- How could you, Max?

18:38.827 --> 18:40.427
When do you bring that up
in a conversation?

18:40.462 --> 18:42.390
By the way, I'm stuck in a
plastic ring with six birds.

18:42.414 --> 18:43.764
Put it on your profile!

18:43.765 --> 18:45.065
Same thing if you have kids.

18:45.100 --> 18:47.901
I think Ashley's looking at me
with a little bit of a weird eye.

18:47.937 --> 18:49.803
- That's...
- That is my lazy eye.

18:49.838 --> 18:51.637
- That is your lazy eye. I apologize.
- Yes.

18:51.672 --> 18:52.905
You even called it a weird eye.

18:52.941 --> 18:54.235
Are you looking at me
or the wall right now?

18:54.260 --> 18:55.042
I'm... Both.

18:55.043 --> 18:57.243
I just would like to take
a little pause in the convo

18:57.278 --> 18:59.345
just to mention that
I need to use the restroom.

18:59.380 --> 19:02.114
Oh, God. This is a great
double date, I just gotta say.

19:02.150 --> 19:03.918
- Who else is on a date?
- What do you mean?

19:03.943 --> 19:07.119
I'm sorry. Does Chuck think
he's on a date with me?

19:07.155 --> 19:08.719
'Cause that's not happening.

19:08.755 --> 19:12.890
I am on a date with Wendy,
and it is going ooh-perfect.

19:12.926 --> 19:14.559
Wow, Chuck, get your wing off there.

19:14.594 --> 19:16.727
- Sorry, sorry. I thought you wanted me...
- Thank you.

19:16.754 --> 19:19.155
- ...to make a move.
- Definitely don't. No, thank you.

19:19.199 --> 19:20.298
Keep your wings to yourself.

19:20.334 --> 19:22.600
- Okay, well...
- Guys, I'm starting to leak a little.

19:22.635 --> 19:24.319
- Out of your butt?
- Ashley, I'm so sorry.

19:24.344 --> 19:27.237
Can you look that way? She's just
gonna shit in the restaurant?

19:27.273 --> 19:30.574
You know what, Max? This has
been really fun. I'm gonna go.

19:30.609 --> 19:32.076
Well, I guess I'll send a...

19:32.111 --> 19:33.344
- Don't.
- Okay.

19:33.379 --> 19:34.378
Bye!

19:34.413 --> 19:36.146
She was pretty fucking cool, right?

19:36.182 --> 19:37.747
- I like her.
- Super cool.

19:37.783 --> 19:39.326
Yeah, you guys were super cool about it.

19:39.351 --> 19:40.750
Where is my charred broccolini?

19:40.786 --> 19:43.319
I ordered it, like what, 15 minutes ago?

19:44.722 --> 19:46.055
(snoring)

19:46.091 --> 19:48.324
- Can you move your fucking wing, pal?
- What are you talking about?

19:48.360 --> 19:49.859
Your wing is digging into my...

19:49.894 --> 19:51.227
- Calm down.
- This is where my wing goes.

19:51.262 --> 19:52.595
No, it does not go there.

19:52.630 --> 19:54.998
- You're perched in an odd position.
- That's were it fucking goes!

19:55.033 --> 19:57.933
(all arguing)

19:57.969 --> 19:59.801
You're scaring Dan. You're scaring Dan.

19:59.836 --> 20:01.203
I don't give a fuck about Dan.

20:01.238 --> 20:02.825
I don't give a fuck about you, Chuck.

20:02.850 --> 20:03.739
That's not cool.

20:03.763 --> 20:06.269
I'm sorry, Diana, but you're
the dumbest bird I've ever met.

20:06.294 --> 20:08.710
- Oh, my God!
- I'm defending you, Diana.

20:08.745 --> 20:10.714
I'll fucking take your wings,
wrap 'em around your...

20:10.739 --> 20:13.482
- Hey! Let go of my wings!
- You guys! No!

20:13.517 --> 20:16.517
- (angry shouting)
- Ow! You're pulling my neck!

20:16.552 --> 20:17.985
Huh?

20:18.021 --> 20:19.120
Oh no!

20:19.155 --> 20:20.854
Geoff.

20:22.058 --> 20:23.690
You're free.

20:23.726 --> 20:25.092
- Oh my...
- Oh, my God.

20:25.128 --> 20:28.529
I, um, uh, I'm-I'm free. What do I...

20:28.564 --> 20:30.631
Geoff, you have to fly.

20:30.666 --> 20:32.400
- No, but you guys are my...
- Go.

20:32.435 --> 20:33.699
This is your White Fang moment.

20:33.735 --> 20:35.368
I don't know that reference...

20:35.404 --> 20:36.936
The dog doesn't wanna go
'cause of Ethan Hawke.

20:36.971 --> 20:38.571
- Right. Right. Fine.
- We don't want you, just go.

20:38.606 --> 20:40.606
- You're free now!
- Fine. Um...

20:40.642 --> 20:42.108
- Bye, Geoff.
- Bye, buddy.

20:42.144 --> 20:44.777
- We'll see you around.
- Bye, you guys.

20:44.820 --> 20:48.089
Wow. It's not the same anymore.

20:48.116 --> 20:49.982
I'm cold on one side.

20:50.018 --> 20:51.216
I say we get someone else stuck.

20:51.252 --> 20:52.951
We can't just get someone else stuck.

20:52.986 --> 20:55.495
- I know this great guy. His name is Mike.
- Yes.

20:55.520 --> 20:57.556
- He doesn't talk much, all right?
- Where did you meet him?

20:57.591 --> 20:59.127
At a batting cage.

20:59.152 --> 21:00.225
- Okay, it's a baseball.
- Oh, my God.

21:00.261 --> 21:02.428
- What? That's crazy.
- It's a baseball. A hundred percent.

21:02.463 --> 21:04.996
- Knock, knock. (laughs)
- All: What?

21:05.032 --> 21:06.898
- Who's there? Someone say who's there?
- Oh, my God!

21:06.934 --> 21:08.232
Who's there?

21:08.268 --> 21:10.034
Geoff is here, you stupid idiots!

21:10.070 --> 21:13.104
Why would you do that?
Why would you come back?

21:13.139 --> 21:15.739
You're my family.
I can't do this without you.

21:15.775 --> 21:16.907
- Awww.
- Bring it in, guys.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.676
Bring it in, bring it in, bring it in.

21:18.711 --> 21:20.945
All: I love you guys.

21:20.980 --> 21:23.448
♪ ♪

21:28.287 --> 21:30.320
(grunting)

21:30.355 --> 21:32.614
Look! Guys, look, up ahead. An opening!

21:32.639 --> 21:35.225
- Oh, God.
- We did it! We're gonna be okay.

21:35.260 --> 21:37.961
God has doth shown thee thine way.

21:37.996 --> 21:39.696
Man, I nailed that.
Did you guys hear that?

21:39.731 --> 21:41.096
Sounded a little clunky to me,
to be honest.

21:41.120 --> 21:42.745
- Hallelujah.
- That was biblical.

21:42.770 --> 21:45.033
- Let's go. Let's go. (panting)
- All right, let's go.

21:46.462 --> 21:49.362
- (thuds)
- (panting)

21:49.407 --> 21:51.140
- (gasping)
- What the fuck is that?

21:51.175 --> 21:53.909
(panting)

21:53.944 --> 21:55.043
Hellbeast!

21:55.079 --> 21:58.679
- Ooh! I'm too pregnant for this.
- It's hideous.

21:58.715 --> 21:59.714
No one move.

21:59.749 --> 22:01.316
They have motion-based vision.

22:01.351 --> 22:02.883
Is that... How do you know that?

22:02.919 --> 22:05.052
- Is that in the bible, or...
- Yeah, is that a bible thing?

22:05.088 --> 22:06.387
It's like a Jurassic Park thing.

22:06.427 --> 22:07.972
- Have you seen <i>Jurassic Park?</i>
- No.

22:08.358 --> 22:09.790
Okay, no. I made all that up.

22:09.826 --> 22:11.459
- Okay. Let's go! Let's go! We should go!
- Run!

22:11.495 --> 22:13.476
- Go, go, go, go, run!
- Mary, come on!

22:13.501 --> 22:15.962
- Okay. I'm going as fast as I can.
- Aah! Whoa!

22:15.998 --> 22:18.064
(panting)

22:18.100 --> 22:19.600
- Mary: Run!
- Phil: Go, go, go, go!

22:19.635 --> 22:22.302
- Mike: Oh, shit!
- Phil: Come on! Mary!

22:22.338 --> 22:24.338
(panting)

22:24.373 --> 22:25.239
(farts)

22:25.274 --> 22:28.142
Phil (shivering): It's getting cold.

22:28.177 --> 22:30.110
- (groans)
- Are you okay, Mary?

22:30.146 --> 22:31.245
Um...

22:31.280 --> 22:32.278
Is it the baby?

22:32.313 --> 22:34.586
- It's okay. It's a false alarm.
- Okay, cool.

22:34.611 --> 22:36.682
Father Mike, um,
how are the rations doing?

22:36.707 --> 22:38.787
Well, Mary ate all the Pringles, so...

22:38.822 --> 22:40.118
- She's feeding for two, Mike.
- You know what?

22:40.142 --> 22:41.188
- Don't throw her under the bus.
- Fuck you, Mike.

22:41.189 --> 22:43.865
You asked where we were at.
I'm telling you, okay?

22:43.890 --> 22:46.526
Okay, but water and everything else.
Are we good with anything?

22:46.561 --> 22:48.394
Good is a little bit
of an overstatement.

22:48.429 --> 22:50.295
- Oh, no.
- Okay so we're out of food.

22:50.330 --> 22:52.586
Mary's contractions
are acting up, so I guess

22:52.611 --> 22:54.181
- I'm in charge now, right?
- Yeah.

22:54.205 --> 22:55.242
No pressure whatsoever.

22:55.267 --> 22:56.773
- The survival of the roach race.
- Oh, Phil. You'll be fine.

22:56.798 --> 22:58.422
And it's like I'm trying
to keep it together,

22:58.447 --> 22:59.947
but I'm not the tough leader
of the group, okay?

22:59.972 --> 23:01.024
Graham was. And guess what?

23:01.049 --> 23:02.408
Mary had to put a fuckin'
bullet in his head

23:02.433 --> 23:03.608
'cause I was too scared to do it.

23:03.644 --> 23:05.310
- And I'm fucking just having...
- Aw, Phil.

23:05.335 --> 23:07.244
...a little bit of what's
known as a panic attack.

23:07.280 --> 23:09.603
I used to get these, but I left
my Xanax in the apartment...

23:09.628 --> 23:11.035
...because of the fucking
apocalypse that happened.

23:11.060 --> 23:13.617
Breathe, baby. It's gonna be okay.

23:13.653 --> 23:16.019
- It's gonna be okay.
- Oh shit, dude.

23:16.055 --> 23:18.722
Phil, what was your daughter like?

23:18.757 --> 23:20.291
- Maddie?
- Yeah.

23:20.326 --> 23:21.492
She was, uh...

23:21.527 --> 23:23.726
She was fun. She was happy and...

23:23.761 --> 23:26.896
- She made my life worth living, you know?
- Hmm.

23:26.931 --> 23:29.431
But what about, what about your baby?

23:29.467 --> 23:33.269
You know, I hate to be
all namaste about it, but...

23:33.305 --> 23:36.792
I swear the universe
has told me that this baby

23:37.214 --> 23:39.576
- is gonna be really fucking special.
- Yeah.

23:39.611 --> 23:42.715
You know, it's like
as if my body just knows

23:42.740 --> 23:44.513
that he has to exist and...

23:44.548 --> 23:47.148
to be honest,
I think that's why I survived.

23:47.184 --> 23:48.550
- Yeah.
- I had hope...

23:48.586 --> 23:49.751
Can you guys shut up?

23:49.786 --> 23:51.453
- Whoa.
- I'm just, like, trying to get some sleep.

23:51.488 --> 23:53.154
- It's been like a long day.
- He's got a good point.

23:53.190 --> 23:55.200
- We should rest, you know?
- Yeah, I'm down for that.

23:55.225 --> 23:56.784
Okay.

24:00.863 --> 24:01.995
(kisses)

24:04.234 --> 24:05.199
(moans)

24:05.235 --> 24:06.800
(metal clanking)

24:06.836 --> 24:08.302
What?

24:09.228 --> 24:10.460
Mike?

24:10.485 --> 24:12.940
- Mike, where the fuck are you going, dude?
- He has all our stuff.

24:12.975 --> 24:14.574
Sorry if the reservation was inaccurate,

24:14.610 --> 24:16.976
but it's gonna be
a party of one today, friends.

24:17.011 --> 24:19.346
- I'll be eating at the bar.
- I'm lost.

24:19.381 --> 24:21.013
- So you can seat just one.
- What are you...

24:21.049 --> 24:22.649
Is this like a metaphor?

24:22.684 --> 24:25.193
One for dinner please.
You get the point, I'm leaving.

24:25.218 --> 24:26.499
Like hell you are leaving us.

24:26.531 --> 24:27.788
- Get the fuck over here, man.
- Yeah, right, Mike.

24:27.789 --> 24:30.624
- Not so fast! All right?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay, dude.

24:30.659 --> 24:31.890
You two just stand back, okay?

24:31.925 --> 24:34.143
- Chill, Mike. Chill, dude. What you doing?
- Oh, my God.

24:34.168 --> 24:36.295
If one of us is gonna
rebuild civilization,

24:36.330 --> 24:39.030
it sure as hell not gonna
be a whore and a yucky gay.

24:39.251 --> 24:41.718
- Have you lost your goddamn mind?
- I said it!

24:41.743 --> 24:43.437
A whore and a yucky gay!

24:43.462 --> 24:45.137
- Watch your mouth, Mike. Watch your mouth.
- Fuck you, Mike!

24:45.172 --> 24:48.706
- Father Mike...
- And as it says in the scripture:

24:48.742 --> 24:50.441
Sayonara, suckers.

24:50.477 --> 24:52.477
God is great! God is good!

24:52.512 --> 24:55.580
It's deus ex machina time,
motherfuckers!

24:56.939 --> 24:58.549
- Oh shit!
- (both laugh)

24:58.585 --> 25:00.004
- Who's a whore now, Mike?
- That's what you get

25:00.028 --> 25:01.697
- for running your mouth, Father Mike!
- Goddamn it.

25:01.722 --> 25:03.288
I didn't even have my damn camera phone.

25:03.323 --> 25:05.055
Mary. Mary, Mary, Ma-Mary...

25:05.091 --> 25:06.757
(both gasping)

25:06.792 --> 25:08.958
Both: Run!

25:08.995 --> 25:10.762
- Come on!
- Run, run, run!

25:10.796 --> 25:13.730
- Oh, fuck! Okay, go, go, go, go!
- Phil, watch out!

25:13.766 --> 25:15.165
(grunts)

25:15.200 --> 25:17.233
Oh fuck. Oh shit.

25:17.269 --> 25:18.868
There's nowhere to go. We're trapped.

25:18.904 --> 25:19.903
Up there!

25:19.938 --> 25:22.105
- Yeah, yeah. Go, go, go, go, go.
- Go, go, go.

25:24.509 --> 25:26.809
(panting, grunting)

25:26.844 --> 25:28.277
- In here.
- Come on! Come on!

25:29.180 --> 25:30.951
- Oh my God. Holy shit, dude.
- Oh my...

25:30.976 --> 25:32.920
- Oh, my God.
- I think we're okay. I think we're okay.

25:32.945 --> 25:34.082
- Oh, my God!
- What's the matter?

25:34.118 --> 25:35.231
Uh... it's happening.

25:35.256 --> 25:36.752
If you have to take a shit,
just go over there,

25:36.788 --> 25:38.387
- 'cause I don't want to see it.
- No, the baby!

25:38.423 --> 25:40.308
- My water broke!
- (stammers) What's that mean?

25:40.333 --> 25:42.290
- I'm having the baby!
- You're having the baby right now?

25:42.326 --> 25:44.559
Jesus Christ, Mary,
this is not a good time. Okay.

25:44.594 --> 25:46.961
- Okay, here. Lay down, lay down, lay down.
- Okay. Okay.

25:46.996 --> 25:49.535
