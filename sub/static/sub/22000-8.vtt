WEBVTT

00:02.470 --> 00:04.570
Okay, see you.

00:08.109 --> 00:11.276
You okay?
You've been here 20 minute.

00:11.278 --> 00:13.145
Are these all the cards
that you have?

00:13.147 --> 00:14.580
Yeah. Who's it for?

00:14.582 --> 00:16.315
It's for my best friend.

00:16.317 --> 00:18.751
Well, we used to
be best friends.

00:18.753 --> 00:20.686
I actually haven't seen her
in a while.

00:20.688 --> 00:24.156
How about... "miss you"?

00:24.158 --> 00:27.192
Oh, I don't really miss her.

00:27.194 --> 00:28.460
Well, I did miss
her graduation.

00:28.462 --> 00:31.530
It was Friday.
She's a lawyer now.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.465
How about "congratulations"?

00:33.467 --> 00:34.800
Well, that's what
I was gonna get,

00:34.802 --> 00:36.735
Except it was actually
just her birthday.

00:36.737 --> 00:38.103
So...

00:39.206 --> 00:40.739
"happy birthday."

00:40.741 --> 00:42.775
Yeah, and then she got
food poisoning at the party.

00:42.777 --> 00:44.309
Huh.

00:44.311 --> 00:45.411
So...

00:48.149 --> 00:49.581
Yeah. It'd just be nice

00:49.583 --> 00:51.717
If there was one card
that said all that.

00:51.719 --> 00:52.818
Hmm.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.853
I think I understand.

00:54.855 --> 00:56.522
You don't miss your friend,

00:56.524 --> 00:59.258
But you miss your
friend's graduation, birthday.

00:59.260 --> 01:00.859
And now,
you're in a convenience store

01:00.861 --> 01:02.728
Looking for a card
in the last minute,

01:02.730 --> 01:05.597
Because your "best friend"
is sick. Hmm?

01:05.599 --> 01:06.632
- Exactly.
- Hmm.

01:07.802 --> 01:09.368
Ah.

01:10.204 --> 01:11.570
Here.

01:11.572 --> 01:13.772
- Oh, that's a sympathy card.
- It's okay.

01:13.774 --> 01:15.307
What's your friend's name?

01:15.309 --> 01:16.742
Uh, Sandra.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.677
- And what's your name?
- Halimah.

01:18.679 --> 01:19.711
Hmm.

01:26.487 --> 01:27.786
"Dear, Sandra.

01:27.788 --> 01:29.888
Sorry you have a friend
like Halimah.

01:29.890 --> 01:32.291
Sincerely, Mr. Kim."

01:32.293 --> 01:34.760
Give it to your friend.
She'll appreciate it.

02:01.689 --> 02:03.489
Umma, look.

02:03.491 --> 02:06.325
- Signed by Jose Bautista.
- Yeah, Eddie Chan bring.

02:06.327 --> 02:07.392
How Eddie Chan get?

02:07.394 --> 02:09.261
He go to lots of
Blue Jays games.

02:09.263 --> 02:12.598
I go to Blue Jays game.
Never even get a rain poncho.

02:12.600 --> 02:15.400
And Stroman bobblehead,
forget about it.

02:15.402 --> 02:17.836
But what Eddie Chan don't have

02:17.838 --> 02:20.305
Is a beautiful wife
who hide bat,

02:20.307 --> 02:22.441
So husband is the only one
to silent bid.

02:22.443 --> 02:25.277
I can't do that.

02:25.279 --> 02:27.713
Thanks again, Mrs. Kim,
for managing
all of the donations.

02:27.715 --> 02:30.282
Yeah, it's very important
for both of us.

02:30.284 --> 02:31.817
Have to support the church.

02:31.819 --> 02:36.555
That's why I donated
Kimâ€™s Convenience gift basket.

02:36.557 --> 02:38.323
Include gum
and fabric softener.

02:38.325 --> 02:39.825
Well, every little bit helps.

02:40.561 --> 02:43.595
Pastor Nina.

02:43.597 --> 02:46.532
- Oh, wow, that is stunning.
- Oh, this?

02:46.534 --> 02:48.233
Thanks.

02:48.235 --> 02:49.935
- So beautiful.
- Mrs. Park:
It's gorgeous, yes.

02:49.937 --> 02:52.604
But my conscience
can't bear it.

02:52.606 --> 02:55.974
Plus, I have several others
that are nicer.

02:55.976 --> 02:58.410
- You're giving to auction?
- Yes.

02:58.412 --> 03:01.280
It was a gift from Mr. Park
when he forgot our 20th.

03:01.282 --> 03:03.582
Oh, I remember
those counseling sessions.

03:04.652 --> 03:06.418
Oh, you brought it up,

03:06.420 --> 03:07.819
So, I thought we were
just going somewhere with it.

03:07.821 --> 03:10.722
I will be over there
if you need me.

03:10.724 --> 03:13.392
So, Mrs. Kim, where are we
putting our premium items?

03:13.394 --> 03:14.793
Right here.

03:14.795 --> 03:16.995
This is worth more
than a basket of cat food.

03:16.997 --> 03:18.797
Not just cat food.

03:18.799 --> 03:20.732
Yeah, also have
a spice girl trading card.

03:20.734 --> 03:22.401
- Very popular on eBay.
- Hmm.

03:22.403 --> 03:24.903
Try not to touch it
with your hands.

03:31.679 --> 03:33.612
Because expensive tacos
are boring now.

03:33.614 --> 03:35.847
And they play way too much
Bon Iver.

03:37.418 --> 03:38.450
Mmm-hmm.

03:38.953 --> 03:40.886
Okay, thanks.

03:40.888 --> 03:42.654
Wait, your toonie.

03:42.656 --> 03:44.389
Oh, no, sorry,
that's not mine.

03:44.391 --> 03:46.391
I don't carry cash, like ever.

03:46.393 --> 03:47.626
Okay.

04:03.344 --> 04:04.409
No way.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.946
No way!

04:07.948 --> 04:09.681
What "no way"?

04:09.683 --> 04:14.620
Appa, I just won $500
with a toonie I found.

04:14.622 --> 04:16.588
You buy scratch ticket
from here?

04:16.590 --> 04:18.056
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

04:18.058 --> 04:19.491
Then you right, no way.

04:19.493 --> 04:22.494
- You not win $500.
- Yes, I did.

04:22.496 --> 04:24.529
East hill variety store
is shut down

04:24.531 --> 04:26.665
After owner keep winning.

04:26.667 --> 04:29.368
Big scandal.
So they change rule.

04:29.370 --> 04:30.936
You work at the store,

04:30.938 --> 04:33.071
You can't win prize
from store.

04:33.073 --> 04:34.973
So we all have to suffer
'cause of one guy?

04:34.975 --> 04:38.844
No, not all suffer, just you.
Rip up.

04:44.752 --> 04:47.486
- Hey, what you doing?
- I'm getting my toonie back.

04:47.488 --> 04:50.622
You find toonie in my store,
my toonie.

05:01.468 --> 05:02.801
Sweet ride.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.436
Yeah, people think
it's a bit of a mom car,

05:04.438 --> 05:06.038
But it's pretty awesome.

05:06.040 --> 05:07.773
No, I meant his.

05:10.377 --> 05:12.644
Oh. Yeah,
bit of a gas guzzler.

05:13.747 --> 05:15.714
Plus, she's a bit late.

05:20.721 --> 05:21.987
I thought that was for me.

05:22.856 --> 05:24.356
Stop.

05:25.459 --> 05:27.693
Jung, wait up! Bye.

05:31.932 --> 05:33.865
Yeah.

05:33.867 --> 05:36.768
- So, how was school?
- Good. We just finished...

05:36.770 --> 05:37.969
I was always surprised

05:37.971 --> 05:39.738
Your dad let you go
to art college.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.740
No offense,
but where's the money in it?

05:41.742 --> 05:43.408
There's actually lots
of opportunities

05:43.410 --> 05:44.843
For photographers.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.878
That's what you say,
but what's the real plan?

05:46.880 --> 05:49.114
Social assistance?
Welfare?

05:49.116 --> 05:51.616
Well, I have a job,
a scholarship.

05:51.618 --> 05:53.151
And I would've had $500

05:53.153 --> 05:54.753
If it weren't for
stupid regulations.

05:54.755 --> 05:58.790
- What do you mean?
- I won.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.559
Holy shit!
That's one-in-a-million.

06:00.561 --> 06:01.993
I don't think
those were the odds.

06:01.995 --> 06:03.829
But I can't claim it
'cause of "lottery rules."

06:03.831 --> 06:05.597
Ah, the bureaucracy.

06:05.599 --> 06:07.766
I have to get license
for ginger every year.

06:07.768 --> 06:11.002
Same dog, new license,
every year!

06:11.004 --> 06:14.005
Though, I guess someone else
could go to the lotto center

06:14.007 --> 06:16.742
And cash this ticket for me.

06:16.744 --> 06:19.478
Janet, say no more.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.046
Wait,
what are we talking about?

06:21.048 --> 06:23.715
Just that if someone went to
cash it for me,

06:23.717 --> 06:24.783
I could get the money.

06:25.386 --> 06:26.551
Ah.

06:26.553 --> 06:28.019
We could split it.

06:28.021 --> 06:29.788
No. It's payment enough

06:29.790 --> 06:31.790
That I'm sticking it
to the man.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.058
And keeping a hopeless,
starving artist

06:33.060 --> 06:34.092
Off the streets.

06:34.895 --> 06:35.961
Sure.

06:38.999 --> 06:41.566
Yes! Mmm!

06:41.568 --> 06:44.436
Yes. Yes, sir.
I totally agree.

06:44.438 --> 06:46.638
He called it his "holy mole."

06:46.640 --> 06:47.839
Bye-bye.

06:52.646 --> 06:54.746
Oh! Come on!

06:54.748 --> 06:56.548
Hey, how goes it?

06:56.550 --> 06:58.817
Oh. I got you
a little something-something.

06:58.819 --> 07:00.051
Your leftovers?

07:00.053 --> 07:02.521
We ordered
the best chicken mole.

07:02.523 --> 07:04.423
Alejandro called it
his "holy..."

07:04.425 --> 07:06.191
"mole." yeah.

07:06.193 --> 07:07.793
So, did I miss anything?

07:07.795 --> 07:09.194
Actually, I was hoping

07:09.196 --> 07:12.164
You could help me
with a delicate situation.

07:12.166 --> 07:15.434
Ooh. Club soda
and a little stain stick
will get that right out.

07:15.436 --> 07:18.403
No.
Employee situation.

07:18.772 --> 07:19.838
Oh.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.807
It sounds serious. What's up?

07:21.809 --> 07:24.209
Well, somebody has
been slacking off,

07:24.211 --> 07:25.677
Letting other employees
do their work,

07:25.679 --> 07:27.546
Taking extended lunches.

07:27.548 --> 07:30.482
Your job is to have
the tough conversations.

07:30.484 --> 07:32.984
Just look them straight in
the eye and say,

07:32.986 --> 07:34.586
"your behaviour
is unacceptable."

07:34.988 --> 07:36.755
Okay.

07:36.757 --> 07:38.089
Your behaviour
is unacceptable.

07:38.091 --> 07:40.592
Perfect.
So, who's the slacker?

07:40.594 --> 07:42.661
Is it Marlow? She didn't get
my mole joke at all.

07:44.531 --> 07:45.931
Oh.

07:45.933 --> 07:48.667
I see.

07:48.669 --> 07:50.502
I'm your boss.
I don't have to check with you

07:50.504 --> 07:52.704
Before I take
a slightly longer lunch.

07:52.706 --> 07:54.673
Two hours is not slightly.

07:54.675 --> 07:56.541
You're timing me?

07:56.543 --> 07:58.543
I couldn't take lunch because
I was doing my work and yours,

07:58.545 --> 08:00.278
While you're in
a patio drinking margaritas.

08:00.280 --> 08:01.746
They were mojitos.

08:01.748 --> 08:03.548
And covering for me
is part of your job.

08:03.550 --> 08:04.816
You never even say thank you.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.451
That's what the mole is for.

08:06.453 --> 08:07.552
I don't want your stupid mole.

08:07.554 --> 08:08.954
Jung...

08:08.956 --> 08:10.956
Jung,
do not walk away from me.

08:10.958 --> 08:13.091
Don't you dare
go past that column.

08:13.093 --> 08:15.227
Do not walk past those chairs.

08:15.229 --> 08:17.696
Jung, do not walk out
that door.

08:23.570 --> 08:24.803
Hi.

08:30.143 --> 08:33.545
Oh. Hello.

08:33.547 --> 08:35.981
Yeah, I leave diamond
in other limousine.

08:35.983 --> 08:37.148
What's this?

08:37.150 --> 08:38.950
Oh! Nothing.

08:38.952 --> 08:41.620
Just have to keep
premium items safe
for auction.

08:41.622 --> 08:44.022
- Don't want steal.
- Hmm.

08:44.024 --> 08:47.826
Maybe I bid on bat,
you bid on the fur coat.

08:47.828 --> 08:50.095
- No, no, we don't need.
- I need bat.

08:50.097 --> 08:51.663
You take a selfie of me.

08:51.665 --> 08:53.665
I don't think you know
what "selfie" means.

08:53.667 --> 08:56.201
Just take a picture. Here.

08:59.706 --> 09:00.739
Yeah.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.173
Okay, give to me. Put on coat.

09:02.175 --> 09:04.276
- Oh, no, no.
- Put on coat.

09:04.278 --> 09:06.111
It looks good on you.

09:06.113 --> 09:07.779
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

09:07.781 --> 09:10.048
Like Marilyn Monroe.

09:10.050 --> 09:13.184
No, look like Audrey Hepburn.

09:13.186 --> 09:14.953
Before she care about animals.

09:14.955 --> 09:16.021
Yeah.

09:19.593 --> 09:23.061
Maybe we take coat
on test drive, huh?

09:23.063 --> 09:25.096
Send message to raccoon
in back alley.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.599
Hmm.

09:27.601 --> 09:29.067
I was hoping
it wouldn't come to this,

09:29.069 --> 09:32.604
But you forced me to
write a report.

09:32.606 --> 09:34.339
Now, I haven't
sent it to hr yet

09:34.341 --> 09:37.208
Because I wanted to give you
a chance to apologize.

09:37.210 --> 09:38.577
I'm sorry?

09:38.579 --> 09:39.911
Oh. Thank you.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.080
Wow. That was not
an easy conversation.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.848
No. I mean,
what am I apologizing for?

09:43.850 --> 09:45.750
Your extended lunches?

09:45.752 --> 09:47.085
You do realize this will go

09:47.087 --> 09:50.889
On your permanent record
permanently?

09:50.891 --> 09:53.592
You know what?
I think I should write
a report of my own.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.227
How many h's in "mojito"?

09:56.229 --> 09:58.363
Okay, this isn't friend
Shannon talking right now.

09:58.365 --> 09:59.831
It's boss Shannon.

09:59.833 --> 10:02.133
And boss Shannon can be
a real hard-ass.

10:02.135 --> 10:06.104
In a strict way, not in
a great Pilates workout way.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.706
Do you really want me to
send this report?

10:07.708 --> 10:09.274
Because it is not flattering.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.675
Do what you got to do.
I'm just working
on my sign-off.

10:10.677 --> 10:12.143
- I'm going to send it.
- Me, too.

10:12.145 --> 10:13.345
- Good.
- Great.

10:13.347 --> 10:15.246
- Super-great. Let's do it.
- Done.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.048
You sent it?

10:17.050 --> 10:18.316
Yeah, didn't you?

10:18.318 --> 10:20.352
- I didn't even write a report.
- What?

10:20.354 --> 10:21.953
This is just an email
to my sister

10:21.955 --> 10:23.755
About catering options
for a family reunion.

10:23.757 --> 10:25.190
Then why did you tell me
you wrote one?

10:25.192 --> 10:26.958
It was a scare tactic.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.729
Well, it worked.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.066
Uh-huh.

10:35.068 --> 10:37.102
Uh, as I said,
it was a bit of prank.

10:37.104 --> 10:39.971
We're pro-pranks here.
April fool's is crazy.

10:41.441 --> 10:43.274
Okay. Bye.

10:45.078 --> 10:46.478
What'd he say?

10:46.480 --> 10:48.813
Someone from hr is
coming tomorrow.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.315
That's bad, right?

10:50.317 --> 10:53.418
Yeah, for both of us,
but especially this guy.

10:54.755 --> 10:55.954
Well, maybe
I could give him a call.

10:55.956 --> 10:58.123
Why?
Because I can't do my job?

10:58.125 --> 11:00.325
Uh, no, because I'm the one
that got tricked into sending
a complaint.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.961
You're also the one being
a big baby over Mexican food.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.329
Okay,
that mole wasn't even good.

11:04.331 --> 11:05.697
It tasted like chocolate.

11:05.699 --> 11:07.866
- Well, I'm sorry!
- Well, me, too!

11:13.440 --> 11:16.174
We look so good,
<i>mongcheri</i> couple.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.710
Fancy, like batman parent.

11:20.781 --> 11:22.280
Huh. What's the problem?

11:22.282 --> 11:26.117
- What if Mrs. Park find out?
- It's not her coat.

11:26.119 --> 11:28.019
Yesterday, it was her coat.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.854
Tomorrow,
it's someone else's coat.

11:29.856 --> 11:32.824
But today,
it's anybody's coat.

11:32.826 --> 11:35.126
Maybe I try,
Snoop Doggy Dogg style.

11:37.831 --> 11:39.264
Such a beautiful evening.

11:39.266 --> 11:41.733
Yeah, it could be
a little cooler.

11:44.171 --> 11:47.405
- It's pastor Nina.
- Quick, this way.

11:56.183 --> 11:58.483
- She didn't see us.
- So close.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.852
Very exciting.
Like bonnie and Clyde.

12:00.854 --> 12:02.387
Yeah, like outlaws.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.756
I about to steal kiss.

12:04.758 --> 12:06.057
Yo!

12:06.059 --> 12:07.492
You just wrecked my mural.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.101
<i>Aeeshcham!</i>

12:16.103 --> 12:18.269
Is it... What?

12:18.271 --> 12:20.338
I'm thinking
of the flungkvist.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.040
So, a couch?

12:22.042 --> 12:24.776
- Or maybe the slurgog.
- Also a couch.

12:24.778 --> 12:26.344
Yeah,
but they have funny names.

12:26.346 --> 12:28.780
What's wrong with "couch"?
That's very funny.

12:31.118 --> 12:34.052
Did you get it?
What happened with the ticket?

12:34.054 --> 12:35.553
It's a moral conundrum.

12:35.555 --> 12:36.988
I wrestle with
the implications

12:36.990 --> 12:39.424
Of our arrangement
all afternoon.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.059
It was
a pretty simple transaction.

12:41.061 --> 12:42.927
Sure, tell that to ginger.

12:42.929 --> 12:45.597
She kept staring at me
with those puppy-dog eyes.

12:45.599 --> 12:47.232
Her one eye seemed to say,

12:47.234 --> 12:48.466
"you're correcting injustice"

12:48.468 --> 12:49.968
"and helping a dear,
dear friend."

12:49.970 --> 12:51.336
I'm more of an acquaintance,
but yeah.

12:51.338 --> 12:53.471
Her other eye
was definitely saying,

12:53.473 --> 12:55.106
"what kind of master are you"

12:55.108 --> 12:57.375
"to put your needs ahead
of the pack's?"

12:57.377 --> 12:59.544
Also, that eye may have
conjunctivitis.

12:59.546 --> 13:02.113
So, I'm guessing
you didn't cash it.

13:09.322 --> 13:10.789
What do you think? Better?

13:10.791 --> 13:12.857
Hmm.
Better than my jacket. Ruined.

13:12.859 --> 13:14.459
Oh, you never even
liked that jacket.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.928
But now I miss. Life is funny.

13:16.930 --> 13:19.297
- Oh, we have to
tell pastor Nina.
- No.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.199
Give to me.

13:21.201 --> 13:25.170
- What you doing?
- Don't worry.

13:25.172 --> 13:26.938
I use beard trimmer,
number-4 setting.

13:26.940 --> 13:28.239
What?

13:28.241 --> 13:30.208
You remember time
I start losing my hair?

13:30.210 --> 13:33.511
Yeah, you cry in shower
every day, for one whole year.

13:33.513 --> 13:38.183
No, not cry,
just sing sad song.

13:38.185 --> 13:40.251
Point is, I take long hair

13:40.253 --> 13:42.220
And brush over short hair.

13:42.222 --> 13:44.222
- No hair.
- And nobody know.

13:44.224 --> 13:45.490
Everybody know.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.425
No, look.

13:49.062 --> 13:50.395
Ah!

13:50.397 --> 13:51.930
- Oh!
- What you do?

13:53.466 --> 13:55.667
Oh. It's on number-2 setting.

13:55.669 --> 13:58.269
Auction is tomorrow!

13:58.271 --> 14:01.306
Maybe everyone accept coat
and still love,

14:01.308 --> 14:02.507
Even if losing hair.

14:10.584 --> 14:12.483
Okay. So far, no bid.

14:12.485 --> 14:13.952
We get fix tomorrow.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.486
Then they can use
for next auction.

14:15.488 --> 14:16.921
No one know.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.058
I'm sure it'll go higher,

14:20.060 --> 14:22.460
But doesn't hurt to dream,
right?

14:22.462 --> 14:24.395
It doesn't hurt you,

14:24.397 --> 14:27.265
But very painful
for baby mink.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.067
If you listen closely,

14:29.069 --> 14:30.902
You can still hear
baby scream.

14:42.215 --> 14:45.183
So, everything described
in your email was a joke?

14:45.185 --> 14:47.252
Yeah. Hilarious.

14:47.254 --> 14:49.954
It's a super-friendly vibe
at the branch.

14:49.956 --> 14:53.057
Yeah. Because I talked to
a number of your colleagues,

14:53.059 --> 14:55.159
And they described
a public confrontation

14:55.161 --> 14:57.095
Where Jung stormed out
of his office,

14:57.097 --> 14:58.596
As you, Shannon, yelled,

14:58.598 --> 15:00.565
"do not walk away from me!"

15:00.567 --> 15:02.901
"Don't you dare walk past
that column!"

15:02.903 --> 15:04.602
"Do not walk past
those chairs!"

15:04.604 --> 15:06.671
"Do not walk out that door!"

15:06.673 --> 15:08.940
Wow. That is really detailed.

15:08.942 --> 15:10.541
There was also a complaint
from a customer.

15:10.543 --> 15:14.312
Well, it was a pretty
elaborate prank, so...

15:14.314 --> 15:17.548
Okay. Can we speak candidly
for a minute?

15:18.952 --> 15:20.551
Sure.

15:20.553 --> 15:22.487
Are you two in a relationship?

15:22.489 --> 15:24.155
- What?
- With each other?

15:24.157 --> 15:25.623
Because this all sounds
very personal.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.292
Oh. I can assure you

15:27.294 --> 15:30.662
The only feelings between us
are professional.

15:30.664 --> 15:33.398
So you're saying
that under no circumstances

15:33.400 --> 15:34.599
You two would look
at each other

15:34.601 --> 15:37.302
As anything more
than colleagues?

15:37.304 --> 15:38.436
Well...

15:39.940 --> 15:41.339
What kind of circumstances?

15:41.341 --> 15:43.441
Yeah, desert island,
first people on mars?

15:43.443 --> 15:44.609
Sure,
if humanity was at stake,

15:44.611 --> 15:46.144
We would do the right thing.

15:46.146 --> 15:48.146
Right, for humanity.
But she has a boyfriend.

15:48.148 --> 15:49.614
I mean,
I didn't a few months ago,

15:49.616 --> 15:51.249
So that would've been the time
to populate mars,

15:51.251 --> 15:53.151
But nothing happened.

15:53.153 --> 15:55.453
Yeah, well,
under the right circumstances.

15:58.325 --> 16:00.091
Oh, wait, I thought
this was off the record.

16:00.093 --> 16:01.960
No, I just got tired
of writing.

16:03.930 --> 16:06.497
Well, bottom line is
we're friends and colleagues

16:06.499 --> 16:10.068
Who would always do
the right thing for humanity.

16:10.070 --> 16:11.235
But here at the branch?

16:12.205 --> 16:14.205
Strictly business.

16:14.207 --> 16:15.606
So, then I take it

16:15.608 --> 16:17.342
You don't want to proceed
with a complaint.

16:17.344 --> 16:18.643
I do not.

16:19.279 --> 16:21.079
All right.

16:21.081 --> 16:24.082
I'll just file this under
"pranks."

16:24.084 --> 16:25.583
You really have a section
for that?

16:25.585 --> 16:27.318
- No.
- Oh.

16:28.188 --> 16:29.320
Take care.

16:30.423 --> 16:31.990
Yeah, you, too.

16:31.992 --> 16:34.625
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

16:36.229 --> 16:37.328
Bye.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.667
- I think he bought it, right?
- Yeah.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.802
We really pulled one over
on old brad.

16:44.804 --> 16:46.237
Yep.

16:51.644 --> 16:53.411
And then you're just gonna
sign your name on the back.

16:53.413 --> 16:55.146
So, I just sign my name
on the back of the ticket?

16:55.148 --> 16:57.281
- I just said that.
- Sorry.

16:57.283 --> 16:59.150
I get nervous
around anyone official.

16:59.152 --> 17:00.418
You should see me at customs.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.153
I start asking
about their travel plans.

17:02.155 --> 17:04.355
Okay. Why don't we just focus
on all the awesome things

17:04.357 --> 17:05.490
We can buy with the money.

17:05.492 --> 17:07.625
Night tables, bowls,

17:07.627 --> 17:09.193
Throw pillows...

17:09.195 --> 17:11.129
Hey, hey. That girl
kind of looks like you.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.797
Hardly.

17:12.799 --> 17:14.599
And why are you so paranoid?

17:14.601 --> 17:15.800
I'm the one
who shouldn't be here?

17:15.802 --> 17:17.802
Why?

17:17.804 --> 17:19.704
Well, I can't technically
claim the money,

17:19.706 --> 17:21.806
Because I work at the store.
It's fraud.

17:21.808 --> 17:23.474
But I worked at the store.

17:25.645 --> 17:27.779
- Are you serious?
- I'm not your guy.

17:27.781 --> 17:29.147
Next.

17:30.050 --> 17:31.149
Come on.

17:32.485 --> 17:34.352
Hi, there.
Can I help you?

17:34.354 --> 17:35.620
$500, please.

17:35.622 --> 17:37.488
We scratched and we won.

17:37.490 --> 17:40.224
I'm just going to need you
to sign right here.

17:42.495 --> 17:44.862
So, you got any plans
for your big win?

17:44.864 --> 17:46.564
Throw pillows.

17:46.566 --> 17:49.233
Other home accessories.
For the home.

17:49.235 --> 17:51.269
- Sounds good.
- Nothing unusual.

17:51.271 --> 17:52.870
But I guess
it's all a matter of taste.

17:52.872 --> 17:54.705
What kind of home do you have?

17:54.707 --> 17:56.841
Can I see some id, please?

17:56.843 --> 17:58.509
Oh. I'm of age. I'm 20.

17:58.511 --> 18:00.178
No. It's just so
we know who you are.

18:00.180 --> 18:01.579
We publish the names
of all the winners.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.815
Do you need to know
where she bought the ticket?

18:03.817 --> 18:06.751
It was a gift. The ticket,
it was already scratched.

18:06.753 --> 18:09.520
"It was already scratched"?

18:09.522 --> 18:11.322
- Who gave it to you?
- I don't know.

18:12.325 --> 18:13.791
Secret Santa.

18:13.793 --> 18:16.160
We do it once a month at work
to boost morale.

18:16.162 --> 18:17.862
So someone won $500

18:17.864 --> 18:19.664
And gave it away
in a secret Santa?

18:19.666 --> 18:21.766
Mmm-hmm.
It was a $500 minimum.

18:23.837 --> 18:25.436
Where do you work?

18:25.438 --> 18:27.305
Convenience... Nope, office.

18:27.307 --> 18:28.706
This is just like that poster.

18:28.708 --> 18:31.843
You know what?
We're just gonna go. Keep it.

18:31.845 --> 18:35.713
Put it towards a hospital
or a park or something.

18:35.715 --> 18:38.382
I made up a footnote
on my midterm.

18:40.753 --> 18:42.453
Oh, a lot of bids?

18:42.455 --> 18:44.689
Oh. Yeah, maybe.

18:44.691 --> 18:45.790
May I?

18:46.759 --> 18:48.593
I know I shouldn't covet,

18:48.595 --> 18:49.927
But my dad's birthday
is coming up

18:49.929 --> 18:51.462
And he's a huge fan.

18:59.506 --> 19:00.805
Oh.

19:00.807 --> 19:03.241
- Did you just out-bid me?
- No.

19:03.243 --> 19:04.709
Oh.

19:04.711 --> 19:08.246
Oh. It's for charity,
and my dad's worth it.

19:10.283 --> 19:12.717
- Oh, very generous.
- Oh, yes.

19:19.859 --> 19:22.393
I don't like
where this is going, Mr. Kim.

19:28.401 --> 19:29.634
No bids?

19:29.636 --> 19:31.636
Premium item
is not for everyone.

19:31.638 --> 19:33.638
Mrs. Kim, far be it for me
to criticize,

19:33.640 --> 19:34.906
But this is a centerpiece

19:34.908 --> 19:36.807
And needs to be
properly displayed.

19:36.809 --> 19:40.745
No, it's better to keep
inside bag. It keep clean.

19:40.747 --> 19:43.281
- I'm afraid I have to insist.
- No, no, no, you can't!

19:43.283 --> 19:45.883
I bid $1,000 for coat!

19:45.885 --> 19:48.352
You can't do that.
It's a silent auction.

19:50.557 --> 19:51.689
Fine.

19:56.563 --> 19:59.797
Going once, going twice. Sold!

19:59.799 --> 20:02.567
Oh, well, actually,
we still have three minutes.

20:04.437 --> 20:07.905
- You can have the bat.
- My mistake! That is time!

20:09.509 --> 20:12.610
I think this looks more
threatening than I intended.

20:15.982 --> 20:17.982
Mmm.

20:20.587 --> 20:22.320
What you doing?

20:22.322 --> 20:24.021
You've been here long time.

20:24.023 --> 20:27.391
Yeah, lots of work to do.

20:27.393 --> 20:28.526
Take a break.

20:29.662 --> 20:30.995
Maybe I'll get some tea.

20:32.832 --> 20:33.898
<i>Yobo.</i>

20:48.781 --> 20:52.717
Not this time, Mr. Bond.
I keep the doomsday device.

20:55.688 --> 20:57.521
- Mr. Kim?
- Pastor Nina.

20:57.523 --> 20:58.956
Hi.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.658
You enjoying
you father baseball bat?

21:00.660 --> 21:01.892
Yes.

21:01.894 --> 21:04.395
Are you enjoying
your wife's fur coat?

21:04.397 --> 21:05.896
Yeah.

21:05.898 --> 21:07.932
You know,
if it wasn't for fur coat,

21:07.934 --> 21:09.634
I could have out-bid you.

21:09.636 --> 21:11.369
Oh. Well,
I guess we'll never know.

21:11.371 --> 21:16.040
What if I offer you trade?
Baseball bat for fur coat?

21:16.042 --> 21:17.708
I don't think so.

21:19.379 --> 21:20.778
I just say think about!
