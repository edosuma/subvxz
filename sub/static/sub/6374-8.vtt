00:07.310 --> 00:10.450
Breaking Into My Apartment?
I Was Just There For The Book.

00:10.590 --> 00:14.430
I Didn't Mean To Hear Anybody Having
Sex. Dwayne And I Are Dear Old Friends.

00:14.590 --> 00:16.690
That Had Nothing To Do With Bradford.

00:16.850 --> 00:20.050
Keep Your Mouth Shut And
Your Old Man Comes Home.

00:20.210 --> 00:23.850
So Lie To Daniel? Not Lie,
Just Don't Say Anything.

00:24.010 --> 00:25.690
Hidin' Out In The Hamptons Sure Do Beat

00:25.850 --> 00:28.800

I Want To See My Children.

00:59.120 --> 01:01.520

To Report On The Condition

01:01.680 --> 01:03.310
Of Publishing Tycoon Bradford Meade,

01:03.470 --> 01:05.630

01:05.800 --> 01:07.960

01:08.910 --> 01:10.710

01:12.680 --> 01:15.070

Hey,I've Been Looking For That.

03:40.930 --> 03:41.970
I Thought Amanda Took It.

03:42.130 --> 03:44.060
I Just Met Her. She Seems Kind Of Mean,

03:44.220 --> 03:46.130
But Maybe Shs Just Having A Bad Day.

03:46.280 --> 03:49.070
No,She's Mean. But I Need That Back.

03:49.220 --> 03:51.010
I'm Packing All My Things Up. Hold On.

03:51.160 --> 03:54.310
You Mean You Actually Got Fired?

03:54.450 --> 03:56.090
How Did That Happen?

03:57.150 --> 04:00.020
I Lied To Daniel, And He Found Out.

04:00.170 --> 04:01.270
You Lied?

04:01.450 --> 04:02.250
I Had To.

04:02.400 --> 04:03.890
Wilhelmina Caught Me
Breaking Into Her Apartment

04:04.040 --> 04:05.980
To Steal The Book. Whoa,Wait.

04:06.140 --> 04:10.250
You Broke Into An Apartment And Stole
Something? Look,I Was Just Doing My Job.

04:10.400 --> 04:13.650
Wow. What's Happened To
You? I Mean,You've Changed.

04:13.800 --> 04:15.730
I Barely Even Recognize
You Except For The Braces,

04:15.880 --> 04:18.390
And God,When Are We Getting Those Off?

04:18.540 --> 04:20.079
Look, I Have Not Changed,

04:20.209 --> 04:23.390
And Gosh,You Ask A Lot Of Questions.

04:23.550 --> 04:25.350
Well,Only Because I Can't Imagine

04:25.500 --> 04:27.290
How You're Doing The
Things You're Doing.

04:27.430 --> 04:30.110
We're Just Not That Kind Of Girl.

04:33.260 --> 04:35.670
Look,You're A Sweet Kid,Okay?

04:36.170 --> 04:37.110
But You're Young And Naive,

04:37.260 --> 04:39.020
And It's A Lot Trickier Than You Think.

04:39.180 --> 04:40.920
Well,I Don't See What's
So Tricky About It.

04:41.080 --> 04:43.570
I Mean,If It's So Hard To Be
A Good Person In This Place,

04:43.730 --> 04:47.020
Well,Then Maybe It's A
Good Thing We're Leaving.

04:47.190 --> 04:48.690
Betty.

04:53.230 --> 04:55.790
Christina,Are You Real?

04:57.930 --> 05:00.970
Are We Done With This Game Then? Yeah.

05:01.130 --> 05:02.310
I Came To Help You Pack Up Your Things.

05:02.440 --> 05:05.200
I Thought This Might
Be A Bit Hard For You.

05:05.720 --> 05:09.430
Christina,Have I Changed...

05:09.580 --> 05:11.810
Since I First Started At "Mode"?

05:11.970 --> 05:14.730
Well,I Think It's Hard Not To Change.

05:14.880 --> 05:16.660
I Don't Know. It's This Place.

05:16.820 --> 05:19.100
It Does Something To You.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.150
Can You Believe This Is Even Happening?

05:22.290 --> 05:24.950
Bradford Seemed Fine.
No,And He's Still Handsome

05:25.110 --> 05:27.200
In,Like,A Sean Connery Kind Of Way.

05:27.370 --> 05:30.070
Why Is It Always Sadder When
Tragedy Strikes Hot People?

05:30.230 --> 05:32.770
No,I Want You To Get
The Hell Out Of Here!

05:32.930 --> 05:36.440
Daniel, Let's Not Make A Scene.
Intensive Care Is For Family Members,

05:36.600 --> 05:38.140
And Since You Never Married My Father,

05:38.280 --> 05:41.270
You're Not Part Of The Family. Stay Out.

05:48.650 --> 05:51.840
I'm Sorry You All Had To See That.

05:52.010 --> 05:55.070
I Caught Him Poking
Around The Morphine Drawer.

05:55.240 --> 05:57.990
I Swear,Underneath It
All, He's Still A Good Boy.

05:58.150 --> 06:00.180
Marc,Get The Car. On It.

06:00.340 --> 06:01.450
All Right,People, Get Out Of The Way.

06:01.620 --> 06:03.180
I Got A Very Important Person Here.

06:03.330 --> 06:05.480
Come On,You Wanna Earn
The Badge? Let's Go.

06:05.630 --> 06:06.450
Out Of The Way, Looky-Loos.

06:06.630 --> 06:07.740
My Name Is Marc St. James,

06:07.890 --> 06:10.210
And I'm Playing A Part In This Drama.

06:11.110 --> 06:13.030
Bradford Meade's
To-Die-For Cavalli Suit

06:13.180 --> 06:14.570
May Have Been Just That.

06:14.740 --> 06:16.420
The Publishing Tycoon Was Rushed

06:16.570 --> 06:18.650
To St. Gavan's Hospital
Following His Collapse,

06:18.800 --> 06:22.600
But Mr. Meade Arrived
Sans Said Suit. Where Ist?

06:22.760 --> 06:25.330
Rumors Abound It's Being
Auctioned On The Internet

06:25.510 --> 06:27.390
Where Bids Are As High As $600,000...

06:27.550 --> 06:29.100
I'm Just Wanna Check On The
Football Score. Football?

06:29.290 --> 06:31.620
Bradford Meade Is In The Hospital.

06:31.770 --> 06:33.070
I'm Sure All The Games
Have Been Canceled.

06:33.230 --> 06:36.320
Hello. Any News On Mr. Meade?

06:36.480 --> 06:39.720
They Still Haven't Found The
Suit. No,I Mean, How Is Mr. Meade?

06:39.880 --> 06:41.860
Well,He's In A Robin's
Egg Blue Hospital Gown

06:42.030 --> 06:43.200
With White Piping.

06:43.360 --> 06:45.800
They Say He's Still Unconscious.

06:45.960 --> 06:49.700
What Is That? Uh,My
Things From The Office.

06:49.860 --> 06:51.470
Oh,My Baby.

06:51.630 --> 06:53.500
I'm So Sorry.

06:53.670 --> 06:55.840
I Know How Much This Job Meant To You.

06:55.990 --> 06:58.590
It's Okay,Dad. I'm Okay.

06:58.760 --> 07:00.180
Give Me Daniel's Number.

07:00.330 --> 07:01.710
I'll Tell Him The Only
Reason You Lied To Him

07:01.870 --> 07:03.770
About Wilhelmina's Affair Was
To Get Me Home From Mexico.

07:03.940 --> 07:07.290
Dad,No. Look,It's
- It's Probably All For The Best.

07:07.450 --> 07:09.530
Good For You,Honey.

07:09.680 --> 07:12.820
Next,You Join A Gym And Get Smoking Hot.

07:12.980 --> 07:14.050
Then When You Run Into Daniel,

07:14.210 --> 07:16.580
He'll Be Begging You To Come Back.

07:16.740 --> 07:19.410
That's The Way I Always Play It.

07:20.880 --> 07:23.850
Mija, You Okay?

07:24.740 --> 07:25.830
I've Just-

07:25.980 --> 07:28.770
I've Been Thinking About This Last Year,

07:29.680 --> 07:33.540
And... Dad,I've Done Things
That I Never Thought I'd Do.

07:33.920 --> 07:37.320
And I Was The One Person Daniel Trusted.

07:37.690 --> 07:39.970
I Let Him Down.

08:00.410 --> 08:03.140
Hello,Betty. So Much For My Nap.

Mrs. Meade,You're
Alive And In My Bedroom.

08:22.330 --> 08:23.510
Actually, In Our Last Hideout,

08:23.660 --> 08:25.900
We Had Separate Rooms And A Fireplace.

08:26.050 --> 08:29.460
Um,Okay,Uh,I Don't
Even Know Who You Are,

08:29.620 --> 08:31.360
But You Can't Be Here.

08:31.510 --> 08:33.880
Betty,I'm Leaving The Country Tonight,

08:34.039 --> 08:35.120
But I Need A Favor.

08:35.289 --> 08:38.400
Um,No. No,I-I Can't Help
You Get Out Of The Country.

08:38.549 --> 08:40.750
You're A Felon. You Could
Get Us All In Trouble,

08:40.900 --> 08:43.150
And My Father Just Became A Citizen.

08:43.299 --> 08:48.350
Here,I Can Give You A Hat. What
About This Sweater? I Like This.

08:48.500 --> 08:50.740
It's Not For Me. It's For My Children.

08:50.890 --> 08:52.450
I Told You, They Gon' Be Fine.

08:52.610 --> 08:54.310
They White.

08:54.770 --> 08:57.560
I Need To Find Out If
Bradford's Changed The Will.

08:57.700 --> 08:58.760
If Wilhelmina Got To Him,

08:58.910 --> 09:00.560
He May Have Left Her The Company.

09:00.720 --> 09:01.930
And I Can't Disappear Without Knowing

09:02.080 --> 09:03.310
My Children Are Taken Care Of.

09:03.450 --> 09:05.940
How Am I Supposed To Know
Anything About Bradford's Will?

09:06.080 --> 09:08.160
I Will Tell You Where
It Is And How To Get It.

09:08.310 --> 09:10.150
It's Right In His Office.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.990
No. I Don't Know. Mrs.
Meade,I Don't Know.

09:13.150 --> 09:14.710
I Mean This Is Exactly The Type Of Thing

09:14.860 --> 09:17.460
I Need To Stop Doing.

09:17.610 --> 09:20.310
Why Would You Stop Helping
People You Care About?

09:20.460 --> 09:23.020
I Thought You And Daniel Were Friends.

09:23.850 --> 09:26.160
You're My Only Hope.

09:28.990 --> 09:30.160
Fine.

09:30.300 --> 09:33.370
Fine,I Will Do It, But For Daniel.

09:33.510 --> 09:35.460
I Owe Him This.

09:38.470 --> 09:39.870
I Just Spoke To Amanda.

09:40.010 --> 09:42.230
No Change. Bradford's Still Unconscious.

09:42.380 --> 09:44.440
It Was A Beautiful Wedding, Willie,

09:44.580 --> 09:46.130
Right Up Until The Heart Attack.

09:46.280 --> 09:49.900
Yes,And Thanks To His
Inconvenient Collapse,

09:50.040 --> 09:51.430
Now My Future Is In Limbo.

09:51.580 --> 09:52.990
Oh,I Know You Don't Like The Limbo

09:53.140 --> 09:55.980
Or The Electric Slide Or
Any Forced Party Dancing.

09:56.130 --> 09:58.050
I Was Supposed To Walk
Into That Building On Monday

09:58.200 --> 10:01.630
As Mrs. Bradford Meade,
Owning Half The Company.

10:01.780 --> 10:04.850
Without That Ring On My Finger,
I Don't Know Where I Stand.

10:05.000 --> 10:05.930
I Know He Changed The Will.

10:06.080 --> 10:08.670
I Just Don't Know What It Says.

10:08.820 --> 10:09.820
For All I Know,

10:09.970 --> 10:14.630
He Could Be Leaving
Everything To... Charity.

10:14.790 --> 10:18.180
Marc,I Think You Know
What We Need To Do.

10:18.330 --> 10:21.520
Find This Chity Person And Kill Her.

10:21.880 --> 10:24.980
We Need To Get Our Hands On The Will.

10:25.580 --> 10:26.900
Yeah.

10:28.820 --> 10:29.700
Hey,L'amanda.

10:29.850 --> 10:32.220
I Just Forgot One Thing. I
Need To Scoot Back To My Desk.

10:32.370 --> 10:34.110
Sorry. Aah,Excuse Me?

10:34.280 --> 10:36.630
You Are No Longer
Permitd In These Offices.

10:36.770 --> 10:39.850
Now I Have Received Word You
Are No Longer An Employee.

10:40.010 --> 10:42.330
You Received Word From
Me. I Told You That.

10:42.470 --> 10:45.400
If I Hadn't, You Wouldn't
Know. Suarez,I Have A Gun,

10:45.550 --> 10:47.910
And I Will Not Hesitate To Use It.

10:48.050 --> 10:50.350
They Give You A Gun? No,Girl,
They Didn't Give Me No Gun,

10:50.510 --> 10:53.800
But I Swear To You, I Will
Jump Out This Circle Desk

10:53.950 --> 10:55.360

That's Right,And Trust Me,
You Don't Want To Mix Up

11:03.040 --> 11:05.060
With The Weekend Security, Suarez.

11:05.210 --> 11:08.550
Respect Yourself And Get Outta Here.

11:08.700 --> 11:11.330
I See U,Suarez!

11:15.550 --> 11:17.180
Hey,Are You Okay?

11:17.330 --> 11:20.000
Oh,Yeah,My Father's Upstairs
Fighting For His Life.

11:20.170 --> 11:22.530
I'm Taking It Out On
This Vending Machine.

11:25.630 --> 11:27.140
He's Gonna Be Okay,Daniel.

11:27.290 --> 11:29.160
You Told Everyone That Yourself.

11:29.300 --> 11:30.560
Come On,Amanda.

05:45.355 --> 11:30.710
What Was I Supposed To Say,Hmm?

11:35.460 --> 11:36.910
It's Just...

11:39.270 --> 11:42.090
You Always Think You're Gonna
Have More Time With Someone.

11:43.400 --> 11:45.590
I Never Told Him I Loved Him.

11:53.430 --> 11:54.410
Do You Love Him?

11:54.570 --> 11:55.950
Yes.

11:58.660 --> 12:00.030
Yes.

12:01.450 --> 12:04.120
We Were Just Never
One Of Those Families.

12:04.760 --> 12:06.570
We Never Said It.

12:07.260 --> 12:08.660
Look,Daniel,

12:08.810 --> 12:12.380
You May Never Have Gotten
His Love Or Approval,

12:12.660 --> 12:14.950
But At Least You Got His Jawline.

12:17.310 --> 12:19.460
Daniel,He's Not Gone.

12:19.820 --> 12:21.480
He's Right Upstairs,

12:21.630 --> 12:25.040
And You Can Still Go Tell
Him Anything You Want To.

12:36.880 --> 12:37.920
Hey,L'amanda.

12:38.060 --> 12:39.840
Hey,Cutie-Pie.

12:39.970 --> 12:43.090
You Just Missed Your
Girlfriend,Betty Suarez.

12:43.260 --> 12:45.620
Ugh. Girlfriend. Please.

12:45.760 --> 12:48.010
I Don't Know How Many Times
I Have To Tell That Girl,

12:48.150 --> 12:50.280
That Is Not The Way I Roll.

12:50.440 --> 12:52.200
Oh,Really? Oh,No.

12:52.350 --> 12:54.320
I'm Sweet Like Sugar, Soft Like Suede,

12:54.490 --> 12:57.260
But Unlike A Piano, I Never Get Played.

12:57.420 --> 12:59.480
Ooh,Honey,Listen,

12:59.620 --> 13:02.400
I Will Play You Like Stevie Wonder

13:02.570 --> 13:04.380
On A Baby Grand.

13:08.780 --> 13:12.480
Sugarstick, Where You Been All My Life?

13:12.900 --> 13:14.210
Math Camp.

13:14.360 --> 13:18.040
Mm,Well,1 Plus 1...

13:18.190 --> 13:19.680
Is 2.

13:19.940 --> 13:21.630
I Knew That.

13:24.990 --> 13:26.220
I Knew You Knew That.

13:26.370 --> 13:29.330
I'm Glad You Knew That
I Knew That You Knew

13:29.470 --> 13:31.150
That I Knew That.

13:38.880 --> 13:40.590
Betty?

13:45.060 --> 13:46.340
Who The Hell Are You?

13:46.500 --> 13:48.930
Uh,Cable Company.

13:49.070 --> 13:51.410
I Didn't Let Anyone In
From A Cable Company.

13:52.360 --> 13:54.310
The Cable Company.

13:54.470 --> 13:56.430
Seriously? Mrs. Meade?

13:56.580 --> 13:58.460
How Many Homes Did You Break Into

13:58.620 --> 14:02.250
Before You Got Caught?
The Cable Company.

14:02.400 --> 14:04.210
You Tell Me That I'm Stupid... Why You Got To
Be Bustin' Me Out Like That In Front Of People?

14:04.370 --> 14:06.450
Fish,Don't Do This, And Fish Don't Do
That. I Told You This Was Not A Good-

14:06.600 --> 14:08.290
You Know Exactly What You're Doing...
Everybody Believes Somebody Came...

14:08.430 --> 14:09.320
And You've Known It From The Very Beginning.
From The Cable Company. I Told You.

14:09.470 --> 14:12.990
Mr. Suarez, So Nice
To See You Again. Hi.

14:14.060 --> 14:14.850
I'm Just Saying,

14:15.000 --> 14:17.160
You Looked A Little Too Into
The Whole Sugarstick Thing.

14:17.310 --> 14:18.420
Hey,I Let You Slip Past L'amanda

14:18.570 --> 14:20.390
So You Can Get The Key
To The Executive Floor.

14:20.520 --> 14:24.750
It's Kind Of Nice Having The Sweetness
Recognized. I Call You Sweet All The Time.

14:24.900 --> 14:27.160
I Know. I'm Just Playin'
Ya. Don't Do That.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.240
Sorry. Okay,I'm Gonna Go
In And Look For The Safe.

14:29.380 --> 14:31.220
You Be Lookout. Oh,No,I
Wanna Look For The Safe.

14:31.380 --> 14:34.060
No,You're Lookout. Okay,You're
Acting Sort Of Bossy.

14:34.210 --> 14:36.840
Oh. Oh,God,I-I Am.

14:36.990 --> 14:39.270
I Used To Just Be A Liar And A Thief,

14:39.430 --> 14:40.670
And Now I'm Bossy,Too.

14:40.810 --> 14:42.520
Sweetie,If It Makes You Feel Any Better,

14:42.660 --> 14:48.550
You've Always Been A Little
Bossy. Oh,Thank You, Sugarstick.

14:54.510 --> 14:55.450
If I Ate Lunch,

14:55.600 --> 14:57.490
Now Would Be The Time To Lose It.

15:04.260 --> 15:06.850
What Are You Two Doing Here?

15:07.010 --> 15:09.350
I Imagine E Same Thing
You're Doing Here.

15:09.510 --> 15:11.250
You're Looking For A Memento

15:11.410 --> 15:13.390
To Remember Your Dying Husband?

15:13.540 --> 15:16.210
Oh,Um, Technically Fianc?

15:16.530 --> 15:17.950
That's One.

15:18.260 --> 15:22.620
Yes,Uh,We Are Here
Looking For A Memento,Too.

15:22.780 --> 15:25.970
Yeah,Mr. Meade Meant A Lot To Me,

15:26.130 --> 15:29.230
Being My Girlfriend's Boss' Father.

15:29.380 --> 15:32.780
Well,Don't Let Us Stop You.

15:32.920 --> 15:35.630
Or Us You.

15:50.700 --> 15:51.750
Nope.

15:51.910 --> 15:54.860
No Memento There.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.350
Nothing In Here,Either.

16:02.760 --> 16:04.170
Ooh,Ooh.

16:04.310 --> 16:07.490
What Is It? Everyone's
Salaries. Nice,Willie.

16:07.640 --> 16:08.860
Oh,Let's End This.

16:09.010 --> 16:10.420
I Can't Stand Another
Minute In This Room

16:10.560 --> 16:13.240
With Tweedledee And Tweedle Diego.

16:13.740 --> 16:16.480
Obviously,You Want To
Find The Will For Daniel.

16:16.620 --> 16:18.110
I Don't Know What You're Talking About.

16:18.260 --> 16:21.130
Oh,Betty. We Both Want The Same Thing.

16:21.290 --> 16:23.710
Why Don't We Agree To Find The Will,

16:23.870 --> 16:25.660
Read It,Shake Hands,

16:25.810 --> 16:27.940
Wash Our Hands And Go On With Our Lives?

16:28.080 --> 16:28.930
Please, Do You Really Think

16:29.110 --> 16:32.170
I Enjoy Scheming,Lying,
And Scurrying About

16:32.310 --> 16:36.150
Like Some Rat With Great
Cheekbones? Yes,I Think You Do.

16:36.300 --> 16:38.090
Mm,Maybe A Little.

16:38.230 --> 16:40.770
But Seriously, I Am Tired Of The Drama.

16:41.040 --> 16:43.710
So Much Drama.

16:51.330 --> 16:53.430
The Will Is In The Wall Safe.

16:56.960 --> 16:59.370
I Have The Combination.

17:01.260 --> 17:02.820
I low Ouyou'ren Trble,Mrs. Meade,

17:02.970 --> 17:04.869
But I Don't Like It.

17:05.020 --> 17:08.990
My Betty's Doing Things She Shouldn't Be
Doing. I Did Not Force Her To Do Anything.

17:09.150 --> 17:10.700
She Said She Wanted Do It For Daniel.

17:10.839 --> 17:13.140
Daniel? After The Way He Treated Her?

17:13.280 --> 17:15.819
Why? What-What Happened?
I'll Tell You What Happened.

17:15.970 --> 17:17.079
Papi.

17:18.349 --> 17:20.369
It's My Other Daughter. Hide.

17:20.510 --> 17:21.119
She Won't Like This.

17:21.280 --> 17:22.579
Are You There?

17:26.680 --> 17:28.430
What Are You Doing Lying On Betty's Bed?

17:28.580 --> 17:29.940
Oh,Nothing.

17:30.080 --> 17:32.880
Putting Away Some Clothes And Got Tired.

17:35.520 --> 17:37.080
Who's She?

17:37.570 --> 17:39.100
Exterminator.

17:39.790 --> 17:41.610
Unbelievable.

17:41.780 --> 17:43.340
Mrs. Meade?

17:43.860 --> 17:47.390
You Are The Worst Fugitive In The World.

17:54.740 --> 17:58.050
Okay,Just So We're
Clear, We Read The Will,

17:58.210 --> 18:01.890
And No Matter Who Wins, We
Respect Mr. Meade's Wishes.

18:02.030 --> 18:03.380
Agreed.

18:04.290 --> 18:05.370
I Just Want To Be Done Here

18:05.500 --> 18:07.710
And Go Back To Mourning My Late Husband.

18:07.860 --> 18:09.750
Um,He's Not Dead Yet,

18:09.930 --> 18:13.130
And,Once Again, You're
Not Technically Married.

18:13.280 --> 18:14.670
That's Two.

18:14.820 --> 18:16.660

18:16.810 --> 18:19.720
Okay,Uh,Here We Go.

18:23.840 --> 18:26.810
Oh,Al Capone's Vault. It's Empty.

18:26.970 --> 18:28.940
Oh,Balls.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.510
The Boat Takes Us To
Naples, We Clear Customs,

18:31.660 --> 18:35.170
We Start A New Life In
Italy. If You Make It.

18:35.320 --> 18:36.690
We Gon' Make It.

She Has The Puzzles.

18:52.380 --> 18:54.720
Are You Out Of Your Mind? What?

18:54.880 --> 18:56.310
Well,She Kinda Looks Like The Picture

18:56.470 --> 18:57.980

18:58.130 --> 19:01.070
But,Um,You Don't,

And You're Claire Meade.

19:02.840 --> 19:04.220
Your Face Is Everywhere.

19:04.350 --> 19:07.780
If You Wanna Be "Maria Elena Sonzoni"...

19:07.940 --> 19:09.760
You Gotta Look Like Maria Elena Sonzoni.

19:09.910 --> 19:13.010
I'm Sorry,But I Just Haven't
Had Time For A Makeover.

19:13.160 --> 19:15.660
Oh. Well...

19:15.790 --> 19:18.870
Lady Fugitive,You Have
Come To The Right Place.

19:20.970 --> 19:23.470
The Will's Supposed To Be In The Safe.

19:23.710 --> 19:24.910
I Don't Understand.

19:25.060 --> 19:26.480
Damn Bradford.

19:26.640 --> 19:29.930
Always So Paranoid.
Everything Was Such A Secret.

19:30.080 --> 19:31.540
Secret. Secret?

19:31.690 --> 19:32.810
Secret Room! Secret Room!

19:33.330 --> 19:34.160
What Room?

19:34.300 --> 19:35.810
What Are You Talking
About? What's Going On?

19:35.960 --> 19:38.880
Oh,Betty,There's Something
On Your Glasses. Really?

19:39.170 --> 19:41.270
Oops. Sorry.

19:43.910 --> 19:45.720
Oh,My God, That Actually Worked.

19:45.870 --> 19:48.490
Come On,Curly. Right Behind You,Moe.

20:04.610 --> 20:06.610
In The Escapee Community.

20:07.160 --> 20:09.780
You Look Like Chita Rivera.

20:09.940 --> 20:10.680
What?

20:10.820 --> 20:12.400
No,No,No, That's A Compliment.

20:12.550 --> 20:14.340
He's Really Got A Thing For Chitrivera.

20:20.610 --> 20:22.620
It's Okay,Dad.

20:23.570 --> 20:26.010
You Don't Have To Fight Anymore.

20:26.520 --> 20:28.910

20:34.390 --> 20:36.240

Go. Go Towards The Light.

20:38.770 --> 20:40.680
No,Dad. Don't Go To The Light.

20:40.820 --> 20:43.270
Light Bad. No Light,No
- Will You Stop?

20:43.420 --> 20:44.460
The Doctors Practically Told Us

20:44.600 --> 20:46.020

Come Out Of This. Dad-

20:46.170 --> 20:48.990
He Is T Gonna Die. Stay Away
From That Damn Light,Dad.

Daniel,I Am Trying To Help Him Find The
Light. Listen To Me. What Are You Doing?

20:50.770 --> 20:52.150
You're Not Helping Him.
Yes,I Am Helping Him.

You're Sending Him To The Light. He's Not
- Will You Two Stop Fighting?

20:55.680 --> 20:58.780
Dad? You're Awake.

20:59.250 --> 21:00.510
Dad,Can You Hear Us?

21:00.660 --> 21:02.630
Dad. See? Ow.

21:05.990 --> 21:08.650
Yeah. I Know About It.
Marc Knows About It.

21:08.790 --> 21:10.450
That's Where The Will Has To Be.

21:10.740 --> 21:15.210
Does Anybody Else Know About It?
Um,Yeah,Christina. Oh,And I Think Amanda.

21:15.360 --> 21:17.130
Oh,So Apparently Everyone Knew

21:17.290 --> 21:19.780
About The Big,Fancy
Sex Room, Except For Me.

21:19.920 --> 21:21.360
It's Like Freshman Year Alover Again.

21:21.510 --> 21:23.660
What Is Going On? I Keep Calling

21:23.810 --> 21:25.350
Your Girlfriend L'amanda

21:25.500 --> 21:27.300
And She's Not Answering.

21:29.280 --> 21:31.160
Oh,Yes.

21:36.880 --> 21:37.910
What?

21:38.210 --> 21:39.550
What Are You Looking At?

21:39.690 --> 21:41.020
That Grate.

21:42.400 --> 21:44.400
It Gets Us Into The Vents
And The Vents Go Everywhere.

21:44.550 --> 21:45.500
This Could Be Our Way Out.

21:45.650 --> 21:46.940
Hold On,Agent Bauer.

21:47.100 --> 21:49.340
We Are Not Wriggling
Through A Heating System.

21:49.490 --> 21:51.140
Do You Want To Get That Will
Or Not? Now Come Over Here.

21:51.300 --> 21:56.050
I'll Climb Up First, And Then I'll Pull
You Up. Wow. Now Who's The Bossy One?

21:56.210 --> 21:59.370
You Know You Love It. True.

22:01.070 --> 22:04.710
Wow. I Can't Believe This Even Exists,

22:04.870 --> 22:07.760
That Bradford Was Even Into This.

22:08.360 --> 22:11.080
He Never Invited Me Down Here.

22:11.890 --> 22:13.640
I Can Do That.

22:19.870 --> 22:20.950
Ooh,I Like This.

22:21.110 --> 22:21.730
Ooh,I Got It. I Got It. I Got It.

22:21.890 --> 22:22.810
I Got It. I Got It. I Got It.

22:22.960 --> 22:24.120
What Does It Say? Well,Give Me A Minute.

22:24.240 --> 22:25.860
I Haven't Read That Many Wills Before.

22:26.010 --> 22:27.560
Oh! Okay,Uh,Uh,

22:27.720 --> 22:30.110
"And Wilhelmina Slater
Will Share My Estate"...

22:30.240 --> 22:31.190
Blah,Blah,Blah,Blah, Blah,Blah,Blah...

22:31.340 --> 22:32.250
"Including, But Not Limited

22:32.400 --> 22:35.540
To The Holdings Of Meade Publications"...
I'm Getting A Good Feeling.

22:35.680 --> 22:38.470
"Upon The Pronouncement
Of Our Marriage. "

22:38.620 --> 22:41.800
And There Goes That Feeling.
It's Over. We're Sunk.

22:42.360 --> 22:45.740
Upon Pronouncement Of Our Marriage.

22:45.890 --> 22:47.060
Oh, I'm Gonna Have To Go Back

22:47.210 --> 22:50.350
To Dancing In A Cage In My Underwear.

22:50.500 --> 22:51.720
Hold On.

22:51.870 --> 22:53.670
Perhaps There's Another Option.

22:53.830 --> 22:56.140
Oh,Thank God, Because
To Be Honest With You,

22:56.290 --> 22:58.360
I Only Had This One Move. Ow.

22:58.510 --> 23:00.570
There Still Might Be Another Way

23:00.710 --> 23:04.140
To Legally Become Mrs. Bradford Meade.

23:04.280 --> 23:06.770
Is There Water Boiling Underneath You?

23:06.920 --> 23:10.330
'Cause I Think I Smell A Plan Brewing.

23:12.340 --> 23:13.950
We're In A Vent.

23:14.090 --> 23:15.300
Can You Believe This?

23:15.440 --> 23:17.270
We Are Actually Crawling Through A Vent.

23:17.430 --> 23:19.630
My Mother Never Even Let
Me Put My Feet On The Sofa.

23:19.790 --> 23:21.880
I Can't Believe You're Enjoying This.

23:22.030 --> 23:25.170
I'm Hot,And I'm Sweaty, And I Give Up.

23:25.320 --> 23:29.490
Betty,Come On. Tap In To
Your Inner Action Hero.

23:29.640 --> 23:31.900
Okay,Mexicans Don't Have Action Herry.

23:32.060 --> 23:34.530
H Weave A Speedy Little Mouse.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.560
Oh,Wait,Wait. We're Coming Up To It.

23:36.730 --> 23:40.540
Oh,Thank God. If I Didn't Think
We Were Running Out Of Oxygen,

23:40.700 --> 23:43.330
I'd Kiss You. Now You
Said That The Secret Room

23:43.480 --> 23:45.050
Is Right Behind The
Closet,Right? Uh-Huh.

23:45.100 --> 23:46.700
We Went 30 Yards At A 40-Degree Angle

23:46.850 --> 23:48.110
From The Elevator.

23:48.260 --> 23:50.610
Well,If My Calcations Are Correc..

23:53.630 --> 23:55.040
Found It.

23:55.180 --> 23:58.060
Oh,Hallelujah.

24:05.160 --> 24:06.790
Ooh,L'amanda. Yes?

24:07.650 --> 24:09.500
I Couldn't Stay Away.

24:09.660 --> 24:13.010
When There's Chemistry,
There's Chemistry.

24:13.700 --> 24:14.510
L'amanda-

24:14.545 --> 24:14.545
Oh!

24:14.640 --> 24:19.040
You And I Are Like Water And Magnesium.

24:19.400 --> 24:21.120
E
- Explosive.

24:21.270 --> 24:24.230
I Am Gonna Learn So Much From You.

24:44.940 --> 24:46.880
No! No.

24:47.060 --> 24:49.850
L'amanda,I Can't Do This. I'm A Dog.

24:50.000 --> 24:53.360
I Will Break Your Heart. Let's
Never Speak Of This Again.

24:53.510 --> 24:54.650
No,But-

24:54.810 --> 24:55.470
Shh.

24:56.170 --> 24:57.320
Shh. Shh.

25:01.210 --> 25:03.160
But I Like Dogs.

25:03.800 --> 25:05.070
Shh. Shh. Shh.

25:10.200 --> 25:11.310
Daniel?

25:11.510 --> 25:13.120
Yeah,It's Me,Dad.

25:13.790 --> 25:15.300
I'm Glad You're Here.

25:16.340 --> 25:19.140
Yeah,Me,Too.

25:20.160 --> 25:22.960
Alexis Just Went Out
To Get You Some Water.

25:27.550 --> 25:29.960
Look,Uh,There's Something...

25:31.250 --> 25:33.690
I
- I've Been Wanting To Say To You.

25:35.900 --> 25:40.770
And It's,Uh, Just,It's Hard For Me.

25:40.910 --> 25:42.700
I Mean,We Talk...

25:43.500 --> 25:45.420
But We Don't Really Talk.

25:46.610 --> 25:48.370
I Don't Know Why.

25:58.700 --> 26:01.020
You're Gonna Be Okay.

26:05.740 --> 26:07.080
Listen...

26:07.220 --> 26:10.020
I'm Just Gonna Tell
The Doctor You're Awak

26:23.830 --> 26:25.790
I Love You,Too,Son.

26:28.280 --> 26:30.890
Mrs. Meade,It's Me.

26:31.020 --> 26:32.300
I Found The Will.

26:32.520 --> 26:33.530
And?

26:33.680 --> 26:35.600
Daniel And Alexis Are Okay.

26:35.740 --> 26:40.500
Oh,Thank You. Oh,I'll Never Forget This.

26:40.650 --> 26:41.920
Can We Please Get Out Of Here?

26:42.070 --> 26:44.500
Because I Am Really
Starting To Lead L'amanda On.

26:44.660 --> 26:46.120
I Just Need To Do One More Thing.

26:46.260 --> 26:47.690
I Need To Leave A Strongly Worded Note

26:47.830 --> 26:49.720
To That Jerk Marc. Okay.

26:49.860 --> 26:53.310
"Dear Marc"
- No. "Marc. "

26:53.380 --> 26:54.000
Good.

26:54.140 --> 26:54.970
Yeah.

26:55.120 --> 26:58.310
Please Thank Betty Again For Me.

26:58.460 --> 27:00.190
Now I Can Leave In Peace.

27:00.340 --> 27:01.430
Yeah 'Cause Crossing The Atlantic

27:01.570 --> 27:04.630
Was Gon' Be A Bitch If She
Was In One Of Her Moods.

27:04.950 --> 27:07.570
You Have The Travel
Scrabble? Yeah,I Got It.

27:07.720 --> 27:10.040
Hey,Can I Eat Dinner In Front Of The Tv?

27:10.190 --> 27:11.760
They're Doing An Interview
On Christina Aguilera

27:11.910 --> 27:15.580
About The Meade Wedding.
I Am Such An Ag-Hag.

27:15.740 --> 27:17.080
You Look Familiar.

27:17.240 --> 27:18.620
Oh,Um...

27:18.770 --> 27:20.570
She's Just An Old Friend Of The Family.

27:20.740 --> 27:24.580
Can't Quite Place The Face.
A Little Chita Rivera,Right?

27:24.730 --> 27:26.070
So Can I Eat And Watch?

27:26.220 --> 27:27.050
Sure,Honey.

27:27.190 --> 27:29.080
Thanks. Love You,Mom.

27:29.290 --> 27:30.710
I Love You,Too.

27:33.950 --> 27:37.820
You,Uh... Have A Very Sweet Boy.

27:37.970 --> 27:39.040
Thank You.

27:41.950 --> 27:43.430
I Can't Do It,

27:43.800 --> 27:45.300
Not Without Seeing My Children.

27:45.440 --> 27:47.950
I Have To Get To The Hospital.
Would You Please Take Me?

27:48.110 --> 27:51.180
Fish,No. Now You Walk
Up In There,You Caught.

27:51.320 --> 27:52.880
I'll Be Okay. Now Wait Here.

27:53.020 --> 27:56.670
We Are Going To Italy.

27:58.450 --> 28:00.630
But If I'm Not Back By 8:00,

28:00.770 --> 28:03.210
Promise You'll Go Without Me.

28:18.170 --> 28:20.560
"So In Conclusion,

28:21.190 --> 28:22.990
You Are A Weenie. "

28:23.140 --> 28:24.730
You're Taking A Writing Class?

28:24.870 --> 28:27.360
I Repeated My Thesis. He Is A Weenie.

28:27.510 --> 28:30.320
And Now I'm Gonna Put It
Where He Can't Miss It.

28:30.490 --> 28:32.550
You Know,Wilhelmina
Also Locked Us In There.

28:32.710 --> 28:35.240
Yeah, But She Scares Me. Ah.

28:40.960 --> 28:42.250
What Is This?

28:43.210 --> 28:44.330
It Looks Like Marc's Been Ordained

28:44.470 --> 28:46.340
To Perform Weddings.

28:46.480 --> 28:47.880
For Who?

28:48.730 --> 28:50.400
Oh,God.

28:51.570 --> 28:53.970
????

28:54.110 --> 28:56.550
We May Be Able To Perform
Surgery In The Morning.

28:56.700 --> 28:59.920
Thank You,Doctor. Oh,This Is Good.

29:00.070 --> 29:02.840
I Told You Not To Count Out
Bradford Meade. He's A Redwood.

29:02.990 --> 29:05.480
I Guess You're Right. He's
Stronger Than I Thought.

29:05.620 --> 29:06.470
Remember When He Spent Eight Hours

29:06.620 --> 29:09.100
Trying To Catch That
Marlin Off Of Portugal?

29:09.260 --> 29:10.420
God,That Was A Great Vacation.

29:10.570 --> 29:13.720
Yeah, I Wish He'd Taken Us.

29:14.330 --> 29:16.520
Excuse Me,Daniel,I-

29:16.670 --> 29:19.120
Mr. Suarez, What Are You Doing
Here? Come With Me,Please.

29:19.280 --> 29:21.820
It's About Your Mother.

29:24.950 --> 29:26.400
They're Gone. Perfect.

29:26.550 --> 29:28.220
I Now Pronounce You Man And Wife!

29:28.360 --> 29:30.690
Oh,Will You Stop That?
You're Ordained,Not Magical.

29:30.840 --> 29:32.450
Do You Have The Papers?
It's All Right Here.

29:32.600 --> 29:35.240
Okay,Well,We Need A
Witness,So Find Someone.

29:35.400 --> 29:35.930
Oh.

29:45.080 --> 29:47.230

29:47.860 --> 29:50.670
Bradford,My Love, I'm Here.

29:51.220 --> 29:52.990
My Darling.

29:53.340 --> 29:56.700
You're Awake. I'm So Happy.

29:57.230 --> 29:59.740
And I Have Some Wonderful News.

29:59.890 --> 30:03.220
You And I Can Still Be Married.

30:10.280 --> 30:11.800
I'm Leaving Tonight.

30:11.960 --> 30:13.370
Mom,You Can't.

30:13.510 --> 30:15.170
Please Stay. We Just Got You Back.

30:15.320 --> 30:17.370
We Can Find Someplace For You To Hide.

30:17.510 --> 30:20.090
I Can't Live Like That, Sweetheart.

30:20.230 --> 30:21.770
They'll Give Up Looking
For Me Eventually,

30:21.920 --> 30:23.480
And We'll Meet Up Somewhere.

30:23.620 --> 30:25.110
Now Just Remember,

30:27.030 --> 30:29.130
You Two Need Each Other.

30:29.470 --> 30:30.810
You're All You Have.

30:30.950 --> 30:33.020
Mom,How Is It That You're
Here? How Did This Happen?

30:33.180 --> 30:34.930
Betty And Her Family.

30:35.240 --> 30:37.090
And,Daniel, You Need To Know

30:37.240 --> 30:40.570
Why Betty Didn't Tell You
About Wilhelmina's Affair.

30:47.300 --> 30:51.290
"Do You,Bradford Meade,
Take Wilhelmina Slater"-

30:51.430 --> 30:52.900
Wait,Wait.

30:53.560 --> 30:56.500
Bradford What Is It? You All Right?

30:56.650 --> 30:59.460
Danielold Me That You
Slept With Your Bodyguard.

31:01.230 --> 31:02.870
That's Ridiculous.

31:03.030 --> 31:04.980
You're Not Making Any Sense.

31:05.130 --> 31:06.550
Now,Sweetheart, I Just Need You

31:06.700 --> 31:08.490
To Say Two Words, "I Do",

31:08.640 --> 31:10.750
And Then We'll Get You Some Pudding.

31:10.890 --> 31:12.890
I Need You To Look Me In The Eye

31:13.020 --> 31:15.350
And Tell Me You Didn't Do It.

31:16.610 --> 31:18.630
I Never Slept With Him.

31:23.890 --> 31:24.920
You Never Loved Me, Did You?

31:25.060 --> 31:25.700
Now,Bradford-

31:25.840 --> 31:29.900
Go On. Get Out Of Here.
I Wa To See My Family.

31:30.050 --> 31:31.560

31:35.200 --> 31:36.340
Hey!

31:39.640 --> 31:40.660
Excuse Me.

31:41.030 --> 31:43.100
Mr. Meade, What Happened?

31:43.260 --> 31:44.770
Tell Me You Didn't Marry Her.

31:44.920 --> 31:48.710
Oh,No, I Came To My Senses.

31:49.110 --> 31:51.070
I Was A Silly Old Fool.

31:51.220 --> 31:53.330
Wilhelmina Never Loved Me.

31:53.700 --> 31:57.370
Only Pson Who Ever Loved
Me Is My Wife Claire.

32:00.310 --> 32:02.270
Why Am I Telling You This?

32:04.210 --> 32:06.560
Would You Like To Tell Her?

32:10.730 --> 32:12.590
Mrs. Meade,It'setty.

32:12.740 --> 32:15.140
Um,I'm Here With Your Husband.

32:15.280 --> 32:17.460
He Wants To Talk To You.

32:17.610 --> 32:19.810
You're In The Elevator?

32:20.430 --> 32:23.680
Mom, You Can't Be
Serious. I Am Doing This.

32:23.830 --> 32:25.490
I Would Rather Spend The
Rest Of My Life In Jail

32:25.640 --> 32:28.830
Than Give Up The Chance To
See My Husband One Last Time.

32:29.050 --> 32:29.960
We'll Walk You In.

32:30.110 --> 32:33.870
No,I Want To Do This Alone,

32:34.020 --> 32:36.590
And I Don't Want Him
To See Me Like This.

32:43.040 --> 32:44.650
Isn't That Claire Meade?

32:44.880 --> 32:46.110
Claire, Come Get A Picture!

32:46.830 --> 32:48.230
Right Here,Claire.

33:04.850 --> 33:06.440
Claire.

33:06.940 --> 33:07.820
You Can't Be Here.

33:07.960 --> 33:09.520
I Don't Care.

33:13.020 --> 33:14.590
I'm So Sorry.

33:15.730 --> 33:17.360
I
Didn't-I-

33:17.530 --> 33:18.680
Shh.

33:19.920 --> 33:22.770
Shh. Don't Talk.

33:23.450 --> 33:25.450
Let's Just Sit Here.

33:26.730 --> 33:29.310
You Know, On Our Wedding Day,

33:29.440 --> 33:32.090
When I Was Waiting To
Walk Down The Aisle To You,

33:32.240 --> 33:34.690
I Remember Thinking,

33:35.360 --> 33:39.910
Someday That Son Of A Bitch
Is Going To Break My Heart.

33:40.950 --> 33:42.470
And I Did.

33:44.070 --> 33:46.090
But I'd Take That Walk Again Tomorrow

33:46.240 --> 33:50.240
If You Could Promise
Me Another 35 Years.

33:56.350 --> 33:59.320
I've Never Loved Anyone More Than You.

34:02.510 --> 34:06.170
Thank You For Giving
Me The Greatest Life.

34:17.610 --> 34:19.969
I'll Give You Guys A Minute.

34:23.389 --> 34:25.800
Look,I Know Why You Couldn't Tell Me

34:25.949 --> 34:28.480
About Wilhelmina's Affair.

34:28.639 --> 34:30.670
Daniel, All I Care About

34:30.810 --> 34:32.929
Is That You Know I'm On Your Side...

34:33.080 --> 34:34.090
Always.

34:34.250 --> 34:35.290
I Know.

34:35.570 --> 34:37.440
I
- I Just...

34:37.810 --> 34:40.230
Felt Betrayed.

34:41.340 --> 34:44.239
Betty,I Would Love For
You To Come Back To Work.

34:45.690 --> 34:48.290
That Means So Much.

34:53.900 --> 34:56.090
But I Don't Think I Can.

34:56.550 --> 34:57.780
What?

34:58.690 --> 35:00.480
Daniel,This
- This Last Year At "Mode,"

35:00.630 --> 35:02.920
I
- I Wouldn't Trade That For Anything.

35:03.210 --> 35:04.610
I Mean,You Took A Chance On Me,

35:04.760 --> 35:07.220
And It Opened Up A
Whole Different World.

35:07.370 --> 35:08.960
It Totally Changed My Life,

35:09.110 --> 35:12.980
But,I Think,Too Much.

35:14.280 --> 35:18.350
I'm Changing Into Someone That I
- I Really Don't Want To Be.

35:20.560 --> 35:22.610
So You're Leaving?

35:23.330 --> 35:25.710
I Think I Have To.

35:26.470 --> 35:28.740
It's Your Life,Betty.

35:29.310 --> 35:31.970
You Do What You Have To Do.

35:53.990 --> 35:56.660
Oh! Please Let Me Go See Him One More-

35:56.820 --> 35:59.200
She's Not Resisting.
Don't Hurt Her. Come On.

35:59.340 --> 36:01.890
I'm Not Fighting You. Daniel,Alexis!

36:02.050 --> 36:05.760
