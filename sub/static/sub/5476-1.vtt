WEBVTT

01:58.744 --> 02:02.374
I know it's always difficult
to determine the value,

02:02.581 --> 02:06.927
but the share price is the
share price, Mr. Karadeniz.

02:07.753 --> 02:10.948
What we can do,
I'm sure you'll appreciate this,

02:11.048 --> 02:12.908
is offer you a fair deal in terms of...

02:13.008 --> 02:15.511
As I told Mr. Walden,

02:15.719 --> 02:18.097
I'm not interested
in profit participation.

02:18.847 --> 02:20.690
WFG needs my shares.

02:20.932 --> 02:24.670
I grant you, sir, your shares are
important for our overall strategy...

02:24.770 --> 02:26.613
Jason, your wife is calling.

02:38.575 --> 02:40.327
How are you, Mr. Karadeniz?

02:40.452 --> 02:42.500
I'm not selling for $18 a share.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.920
Oh, I'm not negotiating this.

02:46.249 --> 02:50.095
This is Jason's deal. We just need
to give him a couple of minutes.

03:19.741 --> 03:21.476
Which way to the bedroom?

03:21.576 --> 03:23.123
It's over there.

03:25.789 --> 03:26.790
Wow.

03:29.418 --> 03:31.011
I love the view.

03:31.336 --> 03:32.633
So do I.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.143
Mr. Karadeniz, how are you?

03:47.936 --> 03:49.504
Am I interrupting something?

03:49.604 --> 03:52.323
No. No, it's okay. We're just...

03:52.733 --> 03:53.905
I can call later.

03:54.025 --> 03:55.993
No, it's fine. It's fine, I assure you.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.454
Asshole.

04:10.667 --> 04:12.715
Everybody's sucking your dick
about the Karadeniz deal.

04:12.836 --> 04:15.214
- Congratulations, you did it.
- Thank you.

04:15.797 --> 04:17.470
I've got a real big one for you.

04:18.175 --> 04:19.927
Sheikh Abdullah Nayed.

04:20.719 --> 04:22.847
Estimated capital, 10 billion.

04:23.680 --> 04:24.706
Wow.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.625
Erik almost got him to
invest a half a billion,

04:26.725 --> 04:29.729
but now he's about to sign
with Horizon Capital.

04:31.062 --> 04:32.314
I want you to take over.

04:33.523 --> 04:34.524
Get him.

04:44.743 --> 04:47.872
Just start with the small
shareholders and work your way up.

04:48.830 --> 04:51.549
Don't worry about that.
Just get it done.

05:17.901 --> 05:19.073
Mr. Montgomery.

05:19.444 --> 05:20.512
Mr. Smith.

05:20.612 --> 05:22.114
Thank you for helping me arrange this.

05:23.031 --> 05:24.248
Useless.

05:24.616 --> 05:26.710
This is garbage.
Who the hell did you use?

05:27.744 --> 05:31.749
No. No, I need real in-depth
research on the guy. Fast.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.484
Deal with it.

05:34.584 --> 05:36.302
Mr. Montgomery.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.088
The Sheikh will see you now.

06:26.803 --> 06:29.206
According to our religion,

06:29.306 --> 06:32.651
feeding birds and treating
them well is a good behavior,

06:33.977 --> 06:36.651
identified with acquiring
merit in the eyes of Allah.

06:38.315 --> 06:42.195
And it was a pigeon that helped Muhammad
when he escaped from the Quraish.

06:47.490 --> 06:50.744
I'm telling you this because I know
many people find it hard to believe

06:51.328 --> 06:54.332
that a Sheikh could be a
passionate piggeon fancier.

06:55.165 --> 06:58.840
Well, I heard Mike Tyson does it.
That's pretty hard to believe, too.

06:59.878 --> 07:03.849
When I'm with my birds,
I feel they bring the best out of me.

07:05.383 --> 07:07.351
I'm sure this is also
the case for Mr. Tyson.

07:09.971 --> 07:12.599
I've already told Mr. Walden

07:13.433 --> 07:15.902
that I won't be investing
in your company.

07:20.398 --> 07:21.866
I like the sound they make.

07:22.108 --> 07:23.343
Isn't it soothing?

07:23.443 --> 07:24.660
Very.

07:25.236 --> 07:29.537
Have you ever wondered why
pigeons are the symbol of peace,

07:29.908 --> 07:32.582
of love and good will?

07:32.953 --> 07:34.921
Every time I hold them in my hands

07:35.038 --> 07:37.357
and look into their eyes,

07:37.457 --> 07:39.880
it's as if I understand exactly why.

07:42.045 --> 07:46.721
To care for them,
to see these noble birds race,

07:47.717 --> 07:49.811
makes me the happiest man in the world.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.853
How do you race pigeons?
Do they fly in circles?

07:54.307 --> 07:57.902
No. They fly in a straight
line back to their loft.

07:59.396 --> 08:03.697
The most fantastic race in the world
is the Barcelona international.

08:04.693 --> 08:08.197
The birds have to fly over
1,000 miles to get back home.

08:08.905 --> 08:09.906
Can you imagine?

08:11.241 --> 08:13.494
That's a long way for such a small bird.

08:13.910 --> 08:16.504
Indeed. It takes them two
days to cover the distance.

08:16.955 --> 08:20.255
The Barcelona race is the
epitome of endurance,

08:20.542 --> 08:24.263
the synonym of willpower,
a hymn to love.

08:24.796 --> 08:26.031
Love?

08:26.131 --> 08:27.257
Yes.

08:27.590 --> 08:30.514
Because the birds fly home to
the one they've left behind.

08:31.136 --> 08:34.436
They want to be reunited as quickly
as possible with the one they love.

08:37.726 --> 08:39.820
It's my dream to win that race one day.

08:41.479 --> 08:42.651
What does it take?

08:42.981 --> 08:44.449
The right bird.

08:45.233 --> 08:46.610
And you don't have it?

08:46.735 --> 08:48.032
No.

08:48.862 --> 08:54.960
A very, very stubborn man
named Jos Pauwels has it.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.418
We have offered him a
huge amount of money,

08:58.997 --> 09:00.499
but he doesn't want to sell.

09:01.750 --> 09:02.967
Why not?

09:03.251 --> 09:04.673
I don't know.

09:08.089 --> 09:09.966
Where is he, this Pauwels?

09:11.468 --> 09:13.516
Flanders, in Belgium.

09:14.179 --> 09:15.180
Have you heard of it?

09:16.931 --> 09:20.652
An ancestor of mine supposedly
died there in World War I.

09:22.812 --> 09:24.655
But let me ask you a favor.

09:25.690 --> 09:29.536
Let me prove to you that you can
trust us with your investment.

09:30.570 --> 09:31.992
Let me get you that bird.

09:32.989 --> 09:35.458
I told you, it can't be done.

09:35.909 --> 09:40.460
Even better. Let me show you that
with hard work and determination

09:40.747 --> 09:43.341
WFG can do what can't be done.

09:44.167 --> 09:46.295
I'm very close to signing with Horizon.

09:47.504 --> 09:49.006
Then I'd better act fast.

09:56.346 --> 09:58.474
...he used to be the village doctor.

09:58.598 --> 10:01.292
The pigeon he's holding
is the champion dove

10:01.392 --> 10:03.770
the Sheikh wants, Wittekop.

10:04.395 --> 10:08.925
This is his granddaughter, Isabelle.
She's a student at the University of Ghent.

10:09.025 --> 10:12.120
Her mother moved back to Holland,
so now she lives with Jos.

10:26.751 --> 10:30.221
It's raining. Again. Welcome to Belgium.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.874
Mr. Montgomery, welcome to Belgium.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.601
Didn't get the memo? It's Mr. Evans.

10:44.519 --> 10:47.568
I've found lodging in the
village itself, as you requested.

10:47.730 --> 10:48.715
Great.

10:48.815 --> 10:51.989
But I have to warn you,
it might not be very comfortable.

10:52.235 --> 10:55.364
Because the place I found
is not really a hotel.

10:56.239 --> 10:59.309
- It's a... A parsonage.
- What?

10:59.409 --> 11:01.311
The local priest is renting out a room

11:01.411 --> 11:03.354
because the Church needs
extra money, I suppose.

11:03.454 --> 11:07.675
But I can book you a hotel in a city nearby.
Everything is very close in Belgium.

11:07.959 --> 11:09.986
No, it's perfect. I want to blend in.

11:10.086 --> 11:12.680
Okay. Here's your Belgian cell phone.

11:13.089 --> 11:15.433
My number is in it in
case you need anything.

11:15.592 --> 11:16.785
Great, thanks.

11:16.885 --> 11:21.081
Voila, this is it.
A very modest car, like you asked.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.333
But we can change it, if you want.

11:23.433 --> 11:24.480
No, it's perfect.

12:27.872 --> 12:29.566
Turn back to the indicated road.

12:29.666 --> 12:32.385
Yeah, yeah. The indicated
road is closed, wise guy.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.843
Oh, what the fuck...

12:54.399 --> 12:55.776
Oh, come on.

12:59.946 --> 13:00.947
Come on.

13:03.866 --> 13:05.163
Shit.

13:55.585 --> 13:56.711
Excuse me.

14:00.923 --> 14:02.470
Sorry, ma'am?

14:02.592 --> 14:03.935
She's asleep, sir.

14:06.804 --> 14:10.775
And without her hearing aid
she's as deaf as a post.

14:11.517 --> 14:13.611
Anna, Anna?

14:13.936 --> 14:16.940
Time to go home. Mass is finished.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.637
See you tomorrow, Anna.

14:22.737 --> 14:24.364
Good-bye.

14:26.949 --> 14:30.294
She falls asleep every morning,
before I even can reach the altar.

14:31.788 --> 14:34.291
- You must be Colin Evans.
- Yeah.

14:36.834 --> 14:38.802
Did you walk all the way from America?

14:39.128 --> 14:42.052
My car got stuck in the mud
a couple of miles back.

14:42.632 --> 14:46.307
I'm sorry to hear that.
I'll send someone later to pull it out.

14:47.512 --> 14:53.485
You know, I was raised by parents that
considered the Americans as our saviors.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.863
And that's why I'm so touched by

14:57.647 --> 15:01.322
you trying to find
your ancestor's grave.

15:01.734 --> 15:05.489
Because he died for my freedom.

15:12.036 --> 15:13.938
I apologize for the mess.

15:14.038 --> 15:18.401
I wanted to replace the old
furniture with more modern things,

15:18.501 --> 15:22.176
but I didn't have the time
to assemble everything.

15:23.089 --> 15:25.842
Don't worry,
I'll deduct it from the room rate.

15:27.343 --> 15:31.018
It's IKEA. Do you have IKEA in America?

15:31.848 --> 15:32.849
Yeah.

15:33.015 --> 15:35.484
Yeah, of course. IKEA is everywhere.

15:37.186 --> 15:38.233
It's like

15:38.980 --> 15:40.106
my boss.

15:46.070 --> 15:48.698
The bathroom is across
the hall, over there.

15:49.866 --> 15:53.291
Dinner is at 7:00. Today is chicken.

15:54.036 --> 15:57.131
I've asked Martha,
my housekeeper, to choose Cecile.

15:57.707 --> 16:00.381
She's a nice, fat chick.

16:02.295 --> 16:05.469
I mean Cecile. Cecile is, not Martha.

16:07.925 --> 16:09.051
Right.

16:11.387 --> 16:12.513
See you tonight.

16:42.752 --> 16:45.255
I was wondering,
I couldn't find your Wi-Fi.

16:45.421 --> 16:46.513
My what?

16:47.131 --> 16:48.383
Your Internet connection.

16:48.925 --> 16:52.099
Oh, no, no. No Internet here. No.

16:53.888 --> 16:55.682
God is my provider.

16:56.891 --> 16:58.234
Right.

17:01.354 --> 17:06.281
I've selected a few books about the
Great War for you from my library.

17:07.109 --> 17:09.783
I know it sounds strange
for a man in my position,

17:10.571 --> 17:14.075
but I'm very interested in war.
I don't know why.

17:15.451 --> 17:18.020
But I'm sure you'll find
them quite interesting

17:18.120 --> 17:22.751
and they could help you to
locate your ancestor's grave.

17:23.626 --> 17:25.378
Yeah. Thank you.

17:25.503 --> 17:26.846
All right.

17:29.090 --> 17:32.310
I wonder, do you know in
which battle he was killed?

17:33.636 --> 17:35.889
No. I only know it was in Flanders.

17:37.598 --> 17:40.977
The American troops have never been here.
They landed in France.

17:42.103 --> 17:46.382
He was English. My great-grandmother
moved to the US with her son

17:46.482 --> 17:47.779
after her husband was killed.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.077
Oh, I see.

17:51.654 --> 17:56.285
I was fearing you would think that
Flanders was just a part of France.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.437
Many people in the US make that mistake.

17:59.537 --> 18:01.539
Yeah. I'm a high school teacher.

18:01.831 --> 18:04.380
So I'm not supposed to make
those kind of mistakes.

18:05.626 --> 18:07.503
Of course. I should have known.

18:12.717 --> 18:15.140
- Enjoy.
- Thank you very much, Martha.

18:16.971 --> 18:21.192
Cecile, as beautiful in
death as she was in life.

19:35.383 --> 19:36.760
Good morning.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.954
The...

19:40.054 --> 19:43.708
He is in church. Morning Mass.

19:43.808 --> 19:44.834
I see.

19:44.934 --> 19:47.278
- Eggs?
- Yes, please.

19:52.608 --> 19:53.825
Is this decaf?

19:54.527 --> 19:55.528
What?

19:57.113 --> 19:59.115
It's like coffee,
but without the caffeine.

20:01.117 --> 20:03.586
We're honest people here, sir.

20:10.918 --> 20:12.295
Oh, one's enough, thank you.

20:18.300 --> 20:21.287
So, Martha, are you from around here?

20:21.387 --> 20:22.559
Yes.

20:23.889 --> 20:27.735
I've lived here all my life.
I know everyone.

20:28.310 --> 20:31.029
So tell me, what do people
do around here all day?

20:32.314 --> 20:33.315
They work.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.489
And when they're not working?

20:35.735 --> 20:38.989
They... They like football.

20:39.447 --> 20:42.391
You know, with the feet.

20:42.491 --> 20:46.712
They like... TV. They like...

20:56.464 --> 21:00.094
I was wondering, is there a local
pub around here somewhere?

21:00.509 --> 21:05.515
Yes. In De Zavelput.
It's three kilometers.

21:16.984 --> 21:19.112
Say if you want more.

21:47.097 --> 21:48.974
Hey, what's up?

21:55.022 --> 21:56.239
Nice day today?

22:01.737 --> 22:03.034
Let me help you.

22:03.906 --> 22:05.203
That's okay.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.038
- Hi.
- Hi.

22:11.163 --> 22:12.506
What would you like to drink?

22:13.541 --> 22:14.963
I'll have a Coke, please.

22:19.922 --> 22:21.031
I'm Isabelle.

22:21.131 --> 22:22.804
I'm Colin. Colin Evans.

22:23.759 --> 22:24.806
Yeah. I know who you are.

22:26.512 --> 22:28.856
Everyone in the village is
already talking about you.

22:30.099 --> 22:31.225
I only just got here.

22:32.142 --> 22:35.612
Well, it's very easy to
become a star in this town.

22:36.564 --> 22:39.158
In the whole of Flanders,
for that matter.

22:40.609 --> 22:42.282
I thought you didn't understand English.

22:44.196 --> 22:45.573
English, yes.

22:46.407 --> 22:48.080
American, no.

22:49.201 --> 22:51.295
He used to be my English teacher.

22:51.871 --> 22:52.918
Yeah.

22:53.622 --> 22:57.718
Until so-called "health problems"
got me fired.

23:05.634 --> 23:08.454
That's the weirdest
pool table I ever saw.

23:08.554 --> 23:10.352
It's very typical for Belgium.

23:11.056 --> 23:12.750
It's a fun game, you know.

23:12.850 --> 23:15.899
Really? I'm actually
pretty good at pool.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.818
Oh, yeah? Would you like to try?

23:19.481 --> 23:20.824
Sure, I'd love to.

23:24.069 --> 23:26.847
Do you want red or white?

23:26.947 --> 23:27.994
Red.

23:28.157 --> 23:31.081
Of course. The color of aggression.

23:31.994 --> 23:34.088
Pierre, leave him in peace.

23:34.246 --> 23:35.543
And Coca-Cola.

23:36.332 --> 23:40.587
So you line up the balls like this.

23:43.547 --> 23:45.908
The game is very simple.

23:46.008 --> 23:49.161
The one who first succeeds
in pocketing his five balls

23:49.261 --> 23:51.514
in the opponent's pocket, wins.

23:52.097 --> 23:54.520
We both start at the same time. Okay?

23:56.018 --> 23:57.144
Okay.

23:57.269 --> 23:59.317
I'll count to three and
then we shoot. Ready?

24:00.606 --> 24:03.109
One, two...

24:03.525 --> 24:05.368
Wait, wait.

24:06.904 --> 24:08.497
You first have to make a bet.

24:09.073 --> 24:10.996
It's his first time,
so let's forget about that.

24:12.284 --> 24:13.786
No, no, I think we should.

24:14.536 --> 24:18.416
I'll buy Pierre a beer every
time I lose. How about that?

24:18.749 --> 24:20.171
Fantastic.

24:20.876 --> 24:24.050
But I want you to have one, too.

24:24.380 --> 24:27.179
Sorry, I don't drink alcohol
this early in the day.

24:28.008 --> 24:31.228
"Sorry, I don't drink alcohol
so early in the day."

24:32.846 --> 24:34.723
Fine. I'll have one, too.

24:36.225 --> 24:38.294
Okay, here goes.

24:38.394 --> 24:39.879
One,

24:39.979 --> 24:40.980
two,

24:41.480 --> 24:42.481
three.

24:44.441 --> 24:45.533
Nice shot.

24:46.568 --> 24:47.928
Thanks.

24:48.028 --> 24:49.575
So, do you work here full-time?

24:50.114 --> 24:52.742
No, only during the summer.

24:53.784 --> 24:56.458
I study biology at the
university in Ghent.

24:59.915 --> 25:01.317
What about you?

25:01.417 --> 25:03.010
I'm a high school teacher.

25:03.293 --> 25:05.216
That's why I have all
summer to find that grave.

25:05.963 --> 25:07.431
Yeah, I heard about that.

25:08.257 --> 25:10.351
I think it's really
great that you do this.

25:13.303 --> 25:16.603
Well, family ties are important
to me and my entire family.

25:21.603 --> 25:24.777
One day, I want to be able to
tell my kids where they came from

25:24.940 --> 25:27.534
so they might better understand
where they're heading.

25:28.819 --> 25:30.241
That's beautiful.

25:32.281 --> 25:33.703
Two beers, please.

25:35.784 --> 25:37.036
No mercy?

25:37.161 --> 25:39.255
You don't look like the
kind of guy that needs it.

25:41.790 --> 25:43.918
A rematch after this one?

25:45.210 --> 25:46.336
Why not?

25:55.637 --> 25:56.854
Shall I walk you to the door?

25:57.765 --> 25:58.857
No.

26:00.434 --> 26:01.651
I'm fine, thank you.

26:02.019 --> 26:03.487
Here, your keys.

26:04.313 --> 26:07.157
No. You keep the car.

26:07.316 --> 26:08.863
- Really?
- Yeah.

26:11.236 --> 26:13.910
You're still gonna help me
find that grave, right?

26:14.323 --> 26:16.826
Yeah. I'm happy to help. It's exciting.

26:19.745 --> 26:21.839
- Sure you don't need help?
- Thank you.

26:23.332 --> 26:24.584
I'm good.

26:25.459 --> 26:26.676
- Bye.
- Bye.

26:27.461 --> 26:28.462
Hey.

26:29.505 --> 26:31.098
Drink lots of water, okay?

26:32.674 --> 26:35.177
Thank you. That's very sound advice.

26:47.106 --> 26:48.858
Come on.

27:18.387 --> 27:21.391
- You're sure this is going to work?
- Yes.

27:21.932 --> 27:24.776
But you must drink it all in one time.

27:48.709 --> 27:50.256
- Hi.
- Hi.

27:51.503 --> 27:52.595
How are you feeling?

27:53.380 --> 27:54.573
Good.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.050
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

27:57.551 --> 27:58.928
Wait, you still have...

28:02.264 --> 28:04.767
- First time you're wearing this?
- Yeah.

28:05.934 --> 28:09.438
- Well, it looks good on you.
- Thanks.

28:10.439 --> 28:13.739
So what cemetery shall we go to first?

28:14.109 --> 28:16.261
I don't know.
There's a lot of them, right?

28:16.361 --> 28:18.284
Yeah, more than 100.

28:19.198 --> 28:21.121
- Let's start with the biggest one.
- Okay.

28:33.754 --> 28:35.973
So, where do we start?

29:04.701 --> 29:05.827
These are really good.

29:06.161 --> 29:09.165
You can't live in Belgium if you don't
like French fries with mayonnaise.

29:13.752 --> 29:15.846
Sure feels good to be out in the open.

29:18.215 --> 29:20.513
This really reminds me of
where I was born and raised.

29:20.676 --> 29:22.019
Where was that?

29:22.302 --> 29:25.852
Bearsville, New York.
It's near Woodstock.

29:26.348 --> 29:28.021
Woodstock. Wow.

29:28.308 --> 29:31.232
Yeah, don't get too excited.
Nothing really happens there anymore.

29:32.604 --> 29:34.197
Does your family still live there?

29:35.983 --> 29:41.911
Yeah, but me and my dad, we...

29:43.532 --> 29:46.376
He's always pushing me.
Ever since I was a kid.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.872
It wears me out sometimes.

29:51.415 --> 29:52.917
I hardly ever see my parents.

29:58.839 --> 29:59.886
What?

30:01.008 --> 30:02.134
Nothing.

30:03.885 --> 30:05.307
It's just that

30:06.555 --> 30:09.183
I thought you said family ties
are really important to you.

30:10.684 --> 30:14.029
They are. They are. It's just...

30:16.773 --> 30:20.368
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to come across all gloomy.

30:21.069 --> 30:23.572
Must be the country air
messing with my head.

30:23.864 --> 30:26.413
- Oh, God, is it 2:00 already?
- Ten past.

30:26.575 --> 30:30.079
Shit. I promised my granddad
I'd join him at the club.

30:30.746 --> 30:34.000
- The club? What kind of club?
- A pigeon club.

30:34.416 --> 30:37.090
- A what?
- He races pigeons.

30:38.045 --> 30:39.262
He's really good at it.

30:39.629 --> 30:41.472
I never knew you could race pigeons.

30:41.798 --> 30:43.800
Well, it's a big sport around here.

30:44.134 --> 30:45.744
Well, I'd love to see this.

30:45.844 --> 30:46.936
Let's go.

30:52.017 --> 30:54.336
Thank God. I thought
you wouldn't make it.

30:54.436 --> 30:57.485
And I can't manage without my mascot.

30:57.773 --> 31:00.447
He says I bring him luck.
Not that his birds need it.

31:02.778 --> 31:06.703
So, you are the American?

31:07.491 --> 31:08.788
I'm afraid I am.

31:10.952 --> 31:14.252
Isabelle tells me you race pigeons.
Sounds very interesting.

31:14.623 --> 31:15.670
Really?

31:17.084 --> 31:21.305
Tell me, what's the thing that
makes it interesting to you?

31:23.256 --> 31:26.260
Just the whole concept, you know.

31:27.594 --> 31:28.720
The whole concept?

31:33.809 --> 31:36.312
- Jos, your turn.
- Okay.

31:37.312 --> 31:38.985
Don't worry about my granddad.

31:39.272 --> 31:41.866
He's always a bit
overprotective when I...

31:42.984 --> 31:44.577
You know, when he sees me with someone.

31:45.487 --> 31:46.659
So he should be.

31:48.448 --> 31:49.620
What are they doing?

31:50.659 --> 31:54.835
Well, the pigeons all have a
ring with all their data on it.

31:55.205 --> 31:59.693
And that big guy over there,
he scans the rings.

31:59.793 --> 32:03.343
And from that moment on,
the pigeons are officially in the race.

32:03.880 --> 32:06.491
The birds are then put
together in shipping crates

32:06.591 --> 32:08.810
and brought to the start
of the race, which is,

32:10.512 --> 32:12.514
Amiens. That's in France.

32:12.681 --> 32:14.024
How far is that from here?

32:14.724 --> 32:15.850
About 200 kilometers.

32:18.228 --> 32:19.320
Look.

32:19.438 --> 32:23.864
That's Wittekop. It's his favorite bird.

33:11.615 --> 33:12.958
What happens next?

33:13.658 --> 33:16.753
Tonight, trucks will take
all the birds to Amiens.

33:16.870 --> 33:18.814
And tomorrow, around 10:00 a.m.,

33:18.914 --> 33:21.383
the birds will all be
released at the same time.

33:21.583 --> 33:25.588
Thousands of them.
The first one home wins.

33:27.088 --> 33:29.616
A real champion dove can
be worth a lot of money.

33:29.716 --> 33:32.014
Up to 200,000 euros.

33:32.761 --> 33:36.436
I'm sure your friend is not interested
in the financial aspect of the sport.

33:37.098 --> 33:40.523
Oh, I find it fascinating, sir.
I'd love to know more.

33:41.353 --> 33:42.775
You should show him your loft.

33:45.649 --> 33:50.371
Tomorrow I could make us a nice lunch.
We could all wait for the birds to return.

33:50.946 --> 33:53.074
That'd be awesome. Thank you.

33:53.615 --> 33:56.118
I'm warning you. It's boring.

33:57.869 --> 33:59.271
He hates my guts.

33:59.371 --> 34:02.124
He'll warm up to you. You'll see.

34:07.671 --> 34:12.598
So, are you ready for some more
country air to mess with your head?

34:12.801 --> 34:13.802
Sure.

34:38.451 --> 34:40.124
This is a really beautiful spot.

34:41.830 --> 34:43.457
I've lived here all my life.

34:44.666 --> 34:49.843
But when my father died,
my mom went back to Holland.

34:50.338 --> 34:53.683
And I went to live with my granddad.

34:55.510 --> 34:56.978
But the house is still ours.

35:00.473 --> 35:03.101
I'd be heartbroken if anything
would happen to this place.

35:04.644 --> 35:06.191
Why would something happen to it?

35:06.855 --> 35:11.201
Well, a while ago, there was
this Belgian building company

35:11.526 --> 35:15.747
and they were planning on putting,
like, a huge apartment complex here.

35:17.073 --> 35:19.542
Luckily they ran out
of financing, but...

35:21.202 --> 35:25.457
I swear, I'd chain myself to a tree.

35:26.708 --> 35:29.131
I'd do whatever it takes
to save this place.

35:33.506 --> 35:39.730
Why is it that everything beautiful has
to be turned into a mall or a gas station?

36:04.412 --> 36:06.164
Yes, David. What have you got for me?

36:06.498 --> 36:10.219
The construction company you're
looking for is called Boulaert NV.

36:10.460 --> 36:11.803
Where are they located?

36:12.212 --> 36:14.340
Actually, not that
far from you, in Bruges.

36:15.173 --> 36:18.552
All right, set up a meeting with
their CEO for tomorrow at 4:00 p.m.

36:19.094 --> 36:21.096
And then book me on a flight
to New York the day after.

36:21.221 --> 36:22.268
You got it.

37:00.385 --> 37:02.513
Are you coming to the party tonight?

37:02.846 --> 37:03.893
What party?

37:04.723 --> 37:06.771
It's to support our local marching band.

37:08.059 --> 37:09.811
The whole village will be there.

37:10.228 --> 37:11.605
You really should come, too.

37:12.689 --> 37:14.908
Sure. I'll be there.

37:16.234 --> 37:18.612
Who's the guy in all the
pictures with your grandfather?

37:20.905 --> 37:22.122
That's my dad.

37:23.074 --> 37:24.667
So he was a pigeon guy, too?

37:26.327 --> 37:27.328
Oh, yes.

37:28.163 --> 37:33.090
But Mom hated his pigeons because
they shat on her laundry.

37:35.170 --> 37:36.513
So he brought them here.

37:41.676 --> 37:44.020
They've won a lot of races together.

37:46.222 --> 37:48.441
The Barcelona Classic was their dream.

37:50.518 --> 37:54.022
They'd just started to train
birds specifically for that race,

37:57.525 --> 37:59.152
but then he died.

38:00.653 --> 38:02.530
In a car crash three years ago.

38:12.332 --> 38:14.609
So is Jos coming home soon?

38:14.709 --> 38:15.881
He is home.

38:17.837 --> 38:19.259
He's in his loft.

38:48.785 --> 38:49.786
Hey.

39:02.924 --> 39:04.801
You ever hold a pigeon?

39:06.052 --> 39:07.053
No.

39:17.814 --> 39:20.067
This is Romeo.

39:22.610 --> 39:23.987
How does that feel?

39:27.699 --> 39:30.202
It's great. It's great.

39:31.035 --> 39:33.188
I can feel its heart. It's racing.

39:33.288 --> 39:34.230
Yeah.

39:34.330 --> 39:37.755
It's because he doesn't know you.
You should talk to him.

39:38.459 --> 39:39.711
What should I say?

39:40.336 --> 39:42.839
Whatever you want. Calm him down.

39:45.758 --> 39:47.305
Hey, handsome.

39:48.469 --> 39:50.813
Don't worry, I'm not going to hurt you.

39:52.807 --> 39:53.899
He likes you.

39:55.643 --> 39:57.420
I will show you something.

39:57.520 --> 39:58.713
What do I do with Romeo?

39:58.813 --> 40:00.486
Put him back in his spot.

40:14.871 --> 40:15.872
Look at this.

40:18.249 --> 40:19.501
Take it.

40:20.835 --> 40:21.986
So tiny.

40:22.086 --> 40:23.679
Just into the world.

40:25.256 --> 40:27.179
Pigeons grow very fast, you know.

40:27.467 --> 40:30.641
In three months' time this
baby will be ready to race.

40:31.429 --> 40:32.726
You should give him a name.

40:33.389 --> 40:35.642
- What, me?
- Yeah.

40:35.767 --> 40:38.020
Maybe one day, he'll win a race for you.

40:39.562 --> 40:40.688
All right.

40:42.273 --> 40:45.026
Speed. I'll call him Speed.

40:45.818 --> 40:47.035
Okay.

40:47.528 --> 40:51.954
From now on,
whenever we see this bird fly,

40:53.326 --> 40:54.452
we'll think of you.

41:01.209 --> 41:02.381
Wittekop?

41:03.378 --> 41:05.176
That's fast, mate.

41:05.588 --> 41:07.386
He's getting better by the day.

41:10.843 --> 41:12.287
You think he's the first one?

41:12.387 --> 41:14.060
Maybe, yeah.

41:15.139 --> 41:17.483
We have to go to the club
to see if he has won.

41:17.892 --> 41:19.519
All right, let's go check.

41:29.404 --> 41:30.530
Jos,

41:31.572 --> 41:34.225
last night, someone broke into Marcel's.

41:34.325 --> 41:37.478
Yeah, all his pigeons are gone.

41:37.578 --> 41:38.955
Good lord.

41:40.164 --> 41:41.416
Is something wrong?

41:42.959 --> 41:45.462
Marcel got robbed of all his pigeons.

41:45.586 --> 41:46.838
It's horrible.

41:47.714 --> 41:49.933
He spent a lifetime
building those birds.

41:52.635 --> 41:54.057
Marcel.

43:01.621 --> 43:03.623
Good afternoon. How may I help you?

43:03.748 --> 43:06.046
I'm Colin Montgomery from WFG.

43:06.501 --> 43:08.403
I have an appointment with Mr. Boulaert.

43:08.503 --> 43:10.221
Yes, Mr. Boulaert is expecting you.

43:10.838 --> 43:12.010
Please follow me.

43:46.541 --> 43:47.793
Colin?

43:48.876 --> 43:51.550
If you see the... You know.

43:52.296 --> 43:53.281
The reverend?

43:53.381 --> 43:55.450
Yes, reverend.

43:55.550 --> 43:58.269
Can you tell him I already go to party?

43:59.387 --> 44:00.413
Okay.

44:00.513 --> 44:01.890
Will you come also?

44:04.475 --> 44:05.626
I don't think so.

44:05.726 --> 44:08.479
You must come. Have some fun.

44:56.611 --> 44:57.612
So you came.

44:57.904 --> 45:00.123
I don't want to miss the number
one party in Bunderzele, right?

45:01.032 --> 45:02.625
Are you making fun of us, Mr. Evans?

45:03.784 --> 45:05.770
Who's the singer?
I want to buy all her records.

45:05.870 --> 45:07.313
Come on, big shot.

45:07.413 --> 45:09.211
Show me how good you
are on the dance floor.

46:22.029 --> 46:26.767
Dear friends, I absolutely want to
thank you from the bottom of my heart

46:26.867 --> 46:29.270
for showing up in such large numbers.

46:29.370 --> 46:32.590
And I'd say, long live Bunderzele.

46:35.376 --> 46:38.050
And now a golden oldie,

46:38.170 --> 46:42.283
a special request from
our dear friend Martha.

46:42.383 --> 46:43.930
The kissing dance.

46:46.095 --> 46:47.187
What?

46:47.346 --> 46:50.333
The kissing dance.

46:50.433 --> 46:51.667
No, no, no. No more dancing.

46:51.767 --> 46:53.144
Oh, come on.

47:06.907 --> 47:08.226
So what do we do?

47:08.326 --> 47:09.418
We kiss.

47:13.914 --> 47:15.650
Are you having fun?

47:15.750 --> 47:16.797
Yeah.

47:17.001 --> 47:20.426
Good. Now you choose a girl.

47:48.115 --> 47:49.267
Hey, what the fuck, man?

47:49.367 --> 47:50.914
Let's rumble.

47:51.869 --> 47:53.121
Leave her alone.

47:59.710 --> 48:00.962
Idiot.

48:11.347 --> 48:12.894
You gonna be okay?

48:14.141 --> 48:16.394
Yeah, it's just a little cut.

48:18.938 --> 48:21.532
I haven't been in a
fight since junior high.

48:26.070 --> 48:29.324
You know, I was on my way to
you when that guy stepped in.

48:30.866 --> 48:31.992
Really?

48:33.452 --> 48:34.453
Yeah.

48:36.664 --> 48:40.965
Then you should finish what you started.

48:47.883 --> 48:50.181
Wait. Isn't this going to hurt?

48:52.054 --> 48:54.148
I hope so.

49:03.732 --> 49:04.858
Martha.

49:07.069 --> 49:10.448
Hey, what's going on in there?

49:10.614 --> 49:13.367
Come on, Martha. Leave them be.

49:13.492 --> 49:15.665
- No sex before the wedding.
- Come on.

49:20.875 --> 49:23.194
Maybe I should go inside, too.

49:23.294 --> 49:24.762
He's not going to get her
up those stairs alone.

49:27.006 --> 49:29.725
Do you want to meet up tomorrow?

49:30.301 --> 49:31.894
After I get back from Ghent?

49:34.180 --> 49:35.181
Yes.

49:37.266 --> 49:39.543
Don't wreck my car, all right?

49:39.643 --> 49:41.395
Thanks for letting me use it.

49:42.771 --> 49:46.446
So I'll come and pick you up
sometime after noon, okay?

49:54.158 --> 49:55.831
Your lips are cold.

50:03.709 --> 50:04.710
Bye.

50:19.475 --> 50:20.567
Are you sitting down?

50:22.603 --> 50:23.796
Yes.

50:23.896 --> 50:25.113
The Sheikh just called.

50:25.231 --> 50:27.734
Guess how much he's
prepared to put in the fund?

50:28.108 --> 50:29.951
Half a billion, right?

50:30.402 --> 50:31.619
Two is more like it.

50:34.031 --> 50:35.032
Wow.

50:35.491 --> 50:37.493
The deal's going to make
you very rich, my boy.

50:38.827 --> 50:40.704
Now, you're on top of it, aren't you?

50:41.830 --> 50:43.127
Sure, yes.

50:43.707 --> 50:46.301
Get it done, get your ass on a plane.

50:47.086 --> 50:48.929
Now, you're flying home tonight, right?

50:50.422 --> 50:53.676
I... Yes.

50:54.218 --> 50:55.470
Good.

51:04.853 --> 51:05.979
Shit.

52:16.759 --> 52:18.853
I was just taking care of Speed.

52:20.262 --> 52:22.685
Look how big he is, in just one day.

52:25.601 --> 52:27.069
I didn't come here to talk about Speed.

52:29.563 --> 52:31.691
I'm here on behalf of Sheikh Nayed.

52:36.445 --> 52:40.916
Mr. Pauwels, I work for a very
powerful financing group in New York.

52:41.408 --> 52:42.751
The Sheikh is a client of ours.

52:42.993 --> 52:45.416
You're wasting your time.
Wittekop is not for sale.

52:45.579 --> 52:46.796
I know.

52:47.039 --> 52:50.484
That's why yesterday afternoon
I had a meeting with the CEO

52:50.584 --> 52:53.007
of Boulaert Construction
Company in Bruges.

52:54.755 --> 52:57.658
Our financing group intends
to provide Bouiaert

52:57.758 --> 53:01.495
with the necessary funding they
need to execute the plans they have

53:01.595 --> 53:04.098
for that beautiful nature
spot near Isabelle's house.

53:05.349 --> 53:06.834
You mean the Kleiputten?

53:06.934 --> 53:09.437
Yes. She's taken me there.

53:10.521 --> 53:14.321
Believe me, I'd love to make sure
that that site remains untouched.

53:15.067 --> 53:18.116
But I can only do that if I can
give my client what he wants.

53:21.198 --> 53:25.544
I'll put 300,000 euros in your
name in an ING bank account.

53:25.953 --> 53:27.546
I don't want any money.

53:27.830 --> 53:31.300
Nevertheless, it'll be there for you.
Always.

53:33.335 --> 53:36.179
What if I told you to go fuck yourself?

53:39.967 --> 53:43.096
Then I'd go ahead and
break Isabelle's heart.

53:43.721 --> 53:44.813
I would.

53:49.101 --> 53:50.899
You know how much
that place means to her?

53:54.106 --> 53:57.155
She said she wouldn't let anyone
touch it for as long as she lives.

53:59.027 --> 54:02.281
And still you want to destroy it?

54:05.117 --> 54:08.979
Let me put it this way,
I wouldn't be standing here

54:09.079 --> 54:14.176
if I wasn't convinced that you love that
girl more than anything in the world.

54:17.671 --> 54:20.345
You... You're a bastard.

54:21.216 --> 54:23.184
That's why they pay me the big bucks.

54:26.472 --> 54:27.519
Jos.

54:28.515 --> 54:31.860
We're giving you a good deal here.
300,000 euros is a...

54:32.019 --> 54:34.021
Shut up. Shut up.

54:47.201 --> 54:48.453
I...

54:49.036 --> 54:50.208
I accept.

54:51.371 --> 54:56.047
But I don't want Isabelle or
anyone else to ever know.

54:57.878 --> 55:04.102
I will tell them that the bird
got lost during practice.

55:05.677 --> 55:08.180
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

55:18.565 --> 55:19.657
Sign here.

55:19.900 --> 55:21.948
You had everything prepared?

55:22.569 --> 55:23.821
Always.

55:25.364 --> 55:28.994
Someone will pick up the bird later
today when Isabelle's in Ghent.

55:37.292 --> 55:38.418
Listen.

55:39.294 --> 55:41.638
Here's my card. Just in case.

55:42.214 --> 55:45.559
Montgomery? That's your real name?

55:46.009 --> 55:47.181
Yes.

55:50.347 --> 55:53.647
And that great-grandfather of yours?

55:54.768 --> 55:56.315
Is he a lie, too?

55:57.104 --> 55:59.778
No. As a matter of fact, he isn't.

56:00.357 --> 56:04.362
Well, then I feel very sorry for him.

56:08.448 --> 56:09.620
Goodbye.

56:37.769 --> 56:39.237
Please sign here.

56:44.568 --> 56:45.569
Thank you.

56:47.321 --> 56:49.449
Sir? Excuse me, sir?

56:49.823 --> 56:50.915
Do you want to take the call?

58:01.436 --> 58:04.940
That was fun. We should do
this again someday soon.

58:06.650 --> 58:08.368
Sure.

58:09.736 --> 58:11.238
Bye.

58:33.260 --> 58:34.637
Come on.

58:36.096 --> 58:38.474
You know, we can't wait any longer, man.
We're gonna have to do it now.

58:39.349 --> 58:40.441
It's your serve, David.

58:40.767 --> 58:43.566
Look. I've looked at the numbers
and I'm saying we move now.

58:45.063 --> 58:46.235
Are you going to serve, or what?

58:47.024 --> 58:49.402
You know, that Skyworks deal
isn't just going to sit there.

58:49.776 --> 58:52.179
Look, I came here to get
a good game in. All right?

58:52.279 --> 58:53.747
Now serve the goddamn ball!

59:06.334 --> 59:08.132
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, darling.

59:09.087 --> 59:11.865
So good to see you. Did you lose weight?

59:11.965 --> 59:13.558
Me? No.

59:25.020 --> 59:26.146
So how's New York?

59:27.272 --> 59:28.319
It's okay.

59:28.648 --> 59:30.116
Did you meet a nice girl already?

59:30.734 --> 59:32.987
- Jeez, Meg, please.
- You stay out of this.

59:33.570 --> 59:35.823
We didn't put him through
college to meet nice girls.

59:37.574 --> 59:40.418
Actually, I did meet someone.
A while back.

59:40.619 --> 59:41.620
Really?

59:41.787 --> 59:44.415
Yeah, but it got complicated.

59:44.831 --> 59:46.549
You've got no time for complicated, son.

59:47.125 --> 59:49.093
I know, Dad, better than anyone.

59:49.836 --> 59:51.088
It's a lonely road to the top.

59:52.547 --> 59:54.515
So you've told me,
like, a million times.

59:54.674 --> 59:57.018
What, is good advice not
good enough for you anymore?

59:57.886 --> 59:58.887
Forget it.

59:59.012 --> 1:00:01.390
Remember you're only the man you
are today because I pushed you.

1:00:01.598 --> 1:00:02.582
I know.

1:00:02.682 --> 1:00:05.502
I didn't have a father who held my
hand and showed me how things worked.

1:00:05.602 --> 1:00:06.586
Okay.

1:00:06.686 --> 1:00:09.214
Mine was drunk half the time,
barely knew my goddamn name.

1:00:09.314 --> 1:00:11.692
I made sure you got everything
you wanted. Everything.

1:00:11.817 --> 1:00:13.319
I don't have everything, Dad.

1:00:13.527 --> 1:00:14.594
What are you talking about?

1:00:14.694 --> 1:00:17.055
You can make more money in a day
than most people do in a lifetime.

1:00:17.155 --> 1:00:19.123
- So what?
- "So what?"

1:00:19.366 --> 1:00:20.743
So what else is there?

1:01:01.491 --> 1:01:03.084
Your mom said you were here.

1:01:07.581 --> 1:01:08.833
What have you got there?

1:01:10.417 --> 1:01:13.591
I was looking around.
Found some old photographs.

1:01:16.256 --> 1:01:17.257
Look at you.

1:01:18.592 --> 1:01:19.809
You're quite the rebel.

1:01:20.886 --> 1:01:22.763
Oh, God.

1:01:26.057 --> 1:01:27.292
That's not Mom, is it?

1:01:27.392 --> 1:01:29.736
No, your mom was the
one taking this picture.

1:01:31.188 --> 1:01:33.862
- Yeah, right.
- God, I remember that day so well.

1:01:35.483 --> 1:01:39.078
This girl in the picture here,
she was your mom's best friend.

1:01:39.988 --> 1:01:42.241
She came on to me,
but I wasn't into her.

1:01:43.158 --> 1:01:44.535
It was your mom I was after.

1:01:48.205 --> 1:01:50.207
She gave me such a hard time.

1:01:51.875 --> 1:01:56.426
But in the end, that day
was the best day of my life.

1:02:00.800 --> 1:02:02.577
There must be another
one of your mom and me,

1:02:02.677 --> 1:02:04.975
'cause I remember, we took it
in turns to take the pictures.

1:02:07.015 --> 1:02:08.858
My God, look at this.

1:02:10.727 --> 1:02:12.104
My father when he was a kid,

1:02:13.063 --> 1:02:16.613
and my grandmother and
her second husband.

1:02:19.861 --> 1:02:21.033
What's this?

1:02:22.447 --> 1:02:23.539
What?

1:02:25.909 --> 1:02:26.910
Is it a letter?

1:02:29.120 --> 1:02:30.337
I'll be damned.

1:02:32.582 --> 1:02:33.879
It's my real grandfather.

1:02:35.335 --> 1:02:39.511
I told you about him when you were
a kid, but you probably won't remember.

1:02:39.756 --> 1:02:42.284
I do remember.
I remember it really well.

1:02:42.384 --> 1:02:44.478
He's the one that went to
the First World War, right?

1:02:44.594 --> 1:02:46.062
Yeah, somewhere in Flanders.

1:02:48.139 --> 1:02:49.812
I can't believe you found this.

1:02:51.351 --> 1:02:53.024
My grandmother must have hidden it,

1:02:54.354 --> 1:02:56.732
because her second husband
was a real jealous guy.

1:03:01.027 --> 1:03:02.199
Read the letter.

1:03:08.660 --> 1:03:09.957
No, you'd better.

1:03:14.833 --> 1:03:15.880
All right.

1:03:18.461 --> 1:03:22.307
"My love, I only have a few
moments to write this letter

1:03:22.465 --> 1:03:24.058
"as we are called to the front.

1:03:26.052 --> 1:03:29.431
"I am scared, but I am
also determined to survive

1:03:29.806 --> 1:03:32.104
"and come home to you and our baby boy.

1:03:33.393 --> 1:03:36.363
"Because if this war has
taught me something,

1:03:36.896 --> 1:03:39.591
"it is that nothing in this
life is more important

1:03:39.691 --> 1:03:41.409
"than to be with the one you love.

1:03:44.237 --> 1:03:46.080
"Yours forever, Stewart."

1:03:54.581 --> 1:03:55.707
You know,

1:03:58.084 --> 1:04:01.554
I've always loved your mother. And you.

1:04:02.922 --> 1:04:04.265
Always.

1:04:45.173 --> 1:04:49.303
His uniform should be able to tell us more
about the regiment he was serving in.

1:04:49.886 --> 1:04:52.330
- Do you mind if I keep this for a while?
- No.

1:04:52.430 --> 1:04:55.354
I think I know someone
who can help us with this.

1:04:58.103 --> 1:05:00.822
I'm very happy your father
is not sick anymore.

1:05:02.816 --> 1:05:06.571
I'm sorry I rushed off like that,
without any explanation.

1:05:08.530 --> 1:05:09.873
It's been a difficult month.

1:05:10.824 --> 1:05:13.668
Not a lot of things happened
here since you left.

1:05:13.993 --> 1:05:15.119
Except for Jos, of course.

1:05:15.662 --> 1:05:16.663
What happened?

1:05:16.788 --> 1:05:18.415
He lost his bird, Wittekop.

1:05:18.581 --> 1:05:21.505
Apparently it didn't return
from a practice flight.

1:05:21.835 --> 1:05:24.964
Jos thinks that maybe
a bird of prey got it.

1:05:25.296 --> 1:05:27.264
- He is very sad.
- Oh, yes.

1:05:27.590 --> 1:05:29.888
He almost never leaves the house.

1:05:30.301 --> 1:05:32.912
Luckily enough there's still
Isabelle to take care of him.

1:05:33.012 --> 1:05:34.730
I wouldn't know what he
would do without that girl.

1:05:38.518 --> 1:05:41.397
This is good. Don't let it get cold.

1:06:14.137 --> 1:06:15.855
The prodigal son returns.

1:06:17.390 --> 1:06:18.687
Is Isabelle here?

1:06:19.267 --> 1:06:20.860
Why do you want to know?

1:06:21.060 --> 1:06:22.482
I want to talk to her.

1:06:23.396 --> 1:06:24.568
I'll go get her.

1:06:34.574 --> 1:06:36.872
Now get out of here.

1:06:37.702 --> 1:06:38.728
Pierre, easy.

1:06:38.828 --> 1:06:40.580
Pierre, stop it!

1:06:47.420 --> 1:06:48.672
What are you doing here?

1:06:49.422 --> 1:06:50.594
I came back.

1:06:50.965 --> 1:06:52.262
Bad idea.

1:06:52.425 --> 1:06:53.517
Can we talk?

1:06:53.760 --> 1:06:55.762
I've got nothing to say to you.

1:06:56.304 --> 1:06:58.706
- Isabelle please, just give me five minutes.
- No.

1:06:58.806 --> 1:07:01.184
- Five minutes, please.
- Go away. No.

1:07:01.893 --> 1:07:04.487
Just disappear again
like you did last time.

1:07:04.979 --> 1:07:06.447
Without a word.

1:07:09.817 --> 1:07:12.195
I'm sorry, okay? I didn't mean to...

1:07:12.445 --> 1:07:15.790
Go away! Go back to
New York and let us be!

1:07:19.118 --> 1:07:20.119
Now get going.

1:07:22.997 --> 1:07:25.841
Okay. But I'll be coming back.

1:07:26.376 --> 1:07:28.299
Good. I'll be waiting.

1:08:23.975 --> 1:08:25.352
I heard you were back.

1:08:27.478 --> 1:08:28.525
Recognize Speed?

1:08:29.647 --> 1:08:30.944
He got big in one month.

1:08:32.525 --> 1:08:33.868
Look at his feathers.

1:08:34.485 --> 1:08:35.702
Beautiful.

1:08:38.531 --> 1:08:40.033
Look at his wings.

1:08:44.454 --> 1:08:47.583
I should start practicing
with him, but...

1:08:52.754 --> 1:08:54.222
Why did you come back?

1:08:56.007 --> 1:08:58.430
I want to tell the truth to Isabelle.

1:09:00.053 --> 1:09:01.396
You can't.

1:09:02.889 --> 1:09:05.017
You promised you wouldn't tell anyone.

1:09:05.558 --> 1:09:06.730
I have to.

1:09:07.393 --> 1:09:09.879
I want her to know who I really am.

1:09:09.979 --> 1:09:11.572
I want to make things right again.

1:09:14.317 --> 1:09:15.409
Then get my bird back.

1:09:16.569 --> 1:09:18.179
That's the one thing I can't do.

1:09:18.279 --> 1:09:19.826
I didn't touch the money, you know.

1:09:20.156 --> 1:09:21.891
- I know.
- So what's the problem?

1:09:21.991 --> 1:09:25.853
Go and tell that Arabic bastard that
he has no right to keep my bird.

1:09:25.953 --> 1:09:26.954
He forced me into selling it.

1:09:27.747 --> 1:09:29.920
He didn't force you. I did.

1:09:30.333 --> 1:09:31.317
Tell him that.

1:09:31.417 --> 1:09:32.485
I can't.

1:09:32.585 --> 1:09:35.088
I'll lose my job and
everything I ever worked for.

1:09:36.506 --> 1:09:38.053
I'm sure you'll find a way.

1:09:38.549 --> 1:09:39.675
Not in this case.

1:09:40.551 --> 1:09:44.181
The Sheikh has put a huge amount of
money into our company's hedge fund.

1:09:44.597 --> 1:09:47.646
Hedge funds only
make rich people richer.

1:09:47.850 --> 1:09:50.569
Exactly. And they don't
like to give things back.

1:09:50.853 --> 1:09:52.446
You don't know if you don't ask.

1:09:52.647 --> 1:09:57.153
Believe me. I've worked a long
time for these people. They won't.

1:09:57.652 --> 1:10:01.782
Then get the hell out of here.

1:10:03.783 --> 1:10:06.127
And don't come near my granddaughter.

1:10:06.786 --> 1:10:09.084
I'll break your neck.

1:10:19.799 --> 1:10:21.301
You spoil me, Martha.

1:10:22.468 --> 1:10:23.745
Enjoy.

1:10:23.845 --> 1:10:25.222
Please. Won't you sit with me?

1:10:25.388 --> 1:10:27.732
- I must do things...
- Please.

1:10:29.517 --> 1:10:30.814
Yes.

1:10:32.478 --> 1:10:35.573
Because I can see you are sad.

1:10:37.608 --> 1:10:39.610
You went to Jos?

1:10:39.944 --> 1:10:41.662
- Yeah.
- How is he?

1:10:42.530 --> 1:10:44.157
Like you said, depressed.

1:10:45.575 --> 1:10:48.419
It will take a long time for
him to forget Wittekop.

1:10:48.995 --> 1:10:50.212
He was very special.

1:10:50.997 --> 1:10:52.590
I don't understand.

1:10:52.749 --> 1:10:58.738
I know he's a great champion, but...
It's still just a pigeon.

1:10:58.838 --> 1:11:00.135
No, no, no, no.

1:11:01.841 --> 1:11:04.139
Not just a pigeon.

1:11:05.052 --> 1:11:06.474
What do you mean?

1:11:06.679 --> 1:11:08.807
Wittekop is...

1:11:09.640 --> 1:11:14.087
How do you say?
Not your real name, but...

1:11:14.187 --> 1:11:15.985
- A nickname.
- Yes.

1:11:17.231 --> 1:11:22.738
In Flemish we say "wittekop"
to someone with blonde hair.

1:11:23.821 --> 1:11:25.289
Like Jos' son.

1:11:26.491 --> 1:11:29.495
His name was Tony.
Have you heard of him?

1:11:30.036 --> 1:11:32.164
I've seen pictures.
He died in a car crash.

1:11:33.998 --> 1:11:39.380
Wittekop was the first pigeon to
come out of the egg after Tony died.

1:11:40.213 --> 1:11:41.510
Do you see?

1:11:43.925 --> 1:11:47.680
The whole village knows that bird.

1:11:48.387 --> 1:11:52.233
We all know how much Jos loves it.

1:11:53.267 --> 1:11:56.692
And when we see it fly,

1:11:56.813 --> 1:11:59.441
we think of his son.

1:12:00.233 --> 1:12:01.234
Sorry.

1:12:08.574 --> 1:12:14.252
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the
start of The Barcelona International,

1:12:14.455 --> 1:12:19.928
the most important race of the year,
with 33,000 pigeons participating.

1:12:20.753 --> 1:12:23.427
Attention for the start of the race.

1:12:24.590 --> 1:12:30.017
Five, four, three, two, one.

1:13:29.822 --> 1:13:32.075
They took off.

1:13:33.993 --> 1:13:36.087
Try not to think about it.

1:13:38.164 --> 1:13:39.916
Some more coffee?

1:13:40.499 --> 1:13:42.126
No, I'm good.

1:13:46.422 --> 1:13:50.302
Did you hear? Colin is back.

1:13:51.510 --> 1:13:52.978
Yes, so I've heard.

1:13:54.138 --> 1:13:57.688
He came to De Zavelput,
but I kicked him out.

1:13:58.684 --> 1:13:59.856
Well done.

1:14:02.980 --> 1:14:04.197
Why...

1:14:05.191 --> 1:14:08.161
did that asshole come back,
for Christ's sake?

1:14:12.990 --> 1:14:16.745
Darling, come back here.
Come on. Give that to me.

1:14:24.210 --> 1:14:27.885
I wasn't planning on ever telling you,
but he won't leave you alone,

1:14:28.005 --> 1:14:30.554
so I'd rather you hear it from me.

1:14:31.050 --> 1:14:36.398
That... asshole isn't called Colin Evans,
but Colin Montgomery.

1:14:37.348 --> 1:14:39.897
And he wasn't here to find a grave.

1:14:40.226 --> 1:14:44.197
Instead, he was hired to
convince me to sell Wittekop.

1:14:47.775 --> 1:14:48.776
Here.

1:14:50.319 --> 1:14:51.741
His business card.

1:14:56.033 --> 1:14:58.206
Did you sell Wittekop?

1:15:01.414 --> 1:15:05.151
- I had no choice.
- How so?

1:15:05.251 --> 1:15:10.553
He threatened to have this
financing group he works for,

1:15:10.923 --> 1:15:15.429
take over Boulaert and to
build all over the Kleiputten.

1:16:23.120 --> 1:16:25.464
Mr. Montgomery.

1:16:26.123 --> 1:16:29.235
Not a lot of people have been
able to track down the Sheikh

1:16:29.335 --> 1:16:30.653
all the way here to Euskirchen.

1:16:30.753 --> 1:16:32.154
Well, I hope I'm not intruding.

1:16:32.254 --> 1:16:33.489
No, on the contrary.

1:16:33.589 --> 1:16:37.685
Oh, look. Our pigeons are
just starting their training.

1:16:37.843 --> 1:16:40.972
These are youngsters.
It's their first time out.

1:16:41.430 --> 1:16:46.357
Actually, the entire wing is full of birds.
The very best money can buy.

1:16:47.186 --> 1:16:48.403
Please follow me.

1:16:52.650 --> 1:16:56.154
Mr. Montgomery,
how good to see you here.

1:16:56.529 --> 1:16:57.781
Good to see you again.

1:16:58.405 --> 1:16:59.702
This is Mr. Conrad.

1:17:00.241 --> 1:17:03.495
I race my European
pigeons from his loft.

1:17:03.619 --> 1:17:04.666
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Hello.

1:17:07.331 --> 1:17:08.628
You must be very good.

1:17:08.749 --> 1:17:10.217
I do my best.

1:17:11.293 --> 1:17:13.487
But the competition is very tough.

1:17:13.587 --> 1:17:14.930
Would you like some tea?

1:17:15.464 --> 1:17:16.465
Thank you.

1:17:17.883 --> 1:17:19.556
I heard you were in Belgium.

1:17:20.136 --> 1:17:22.764
Yes, I was visiting Jos Pauwels.

1:17:23.556 --> 1:17:24.728
Interesting.

1:17:25.808 --> 1:17:27.060
How is he doing?

1:17:27.268 --> 1:17:29.862
Well, as a matter of fact,

1:17:29.979 --> 1:17:33.574
I wanted to talk to you about
something that concerns him.

1:17:36.527 --> 1:17:39.576
If you will excuse me,
I have to tend to the pigeons.

1:17:45.411 --> 1:17:47.413
Seems to me your pigeons
are in excellent hands.

1:17:48.414 --> 1:17:49.540
Yes.

1:17:50.624 --> 1:17:52.922
If only we could have better results.

1:17:55.713 --> 1:17:59.843
I was wondering if we could talk about
the pigeon I recently acquired for you.

1:18:00.885 --> 1:18:04.246
I hope you found my gratitude
to be sufficiently generous?

1:18:04.346 --> 1:18:07.771
Yes, very generous. Thank you.

1:18:10.978 --> 1:18:17.486
It's just that I recently discovered
that the ties between a fancier

1:18:17.610 --> 1:18:19.578
and his bird can be very intense.

1:18:19.778 --> 1:18:21.906
Oh, yes, very much so.

1:18:25.534 --> 1:18:26.956
That's why I...

1:18:28.954 --> 1:18:31.753
I was wondering if you
would reconsider Wittekop.

1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:34.593
What do you mean, reconsider?

1:18:36.295 --> 1:18:40.220
Mr. Pauwels really
regrets his decision. A lot.

1:18:41.508 --> 1:18:44.808
I'm not surprised. That bird is amazing.

1:18:47.306 --> 1:18:50.981
And it's going to stay with
me until the day it dies.

1:18:57.566 --> 1:18:59.068
I have to run.

1:18:59.735 --> 1:19:01.658
I hope you'll stay for the night.

1:19:01.820 --> 1:19:05.141
Maybe I could use your advice
in a few financial matters.

1:19:05.241 --> 1:19:06.458
Of course.

1:19:31.517 --> 1:19:34.896
- Is Colin here?
- No. Why?

1:19:35.688 --> 1:19:37.590
That's a pity.

1:19:37.690 --> 1:19:42.036
You can't imagine what I've discovered
about his great-grandfather.

1:19:42.152 --> 1:19:45.497
It's, it's... just unbelievable.

1:19:54.665 --> 1:19:57.544
That's Colin's great-grandfather.

1:20:00.879 --> 1:20:02.381
He looks a lot like Colin.

1:20:02.506 --> 1:20:07.012
And that picture was taken
near the Cloth Hall in Ypres.

1:20:08.387 --> 1:20:10.435
Do you see that truck in the background?

1:20:11.223 --> 1:20:12.395
Look here.

1:20:13.392 --> 1:20:17.272
That's the same truck.
Look closely at it.

1:20:19.690 --> 1:20:21.613
It's full of pigeons.

1:20:22.067 --> 1:20:25.287
That's a rolling pigeon loft.

1:20:25.404 --> 1:20:31.252
Because pigeons were crucial to
communication in World War One.

1:20:31.410 --> 1:20:33.959
And the men who took
care of those pigeons

1:20:34.079 --> 1:20:36.798
were called the Pigeoneers.

1:20:36.915 --> 1:20:38.462
And now... Hold on.

1:20:39.251 --> 1:20:40.377
Here.

1:20:41.045 --> 1:20:45.721
Now have a close look at what's
standing behind that soldier's leg.

1:20:47.760 --> 1:20:48.932
Do you see?

1:20:49.928 --> 1:20:52.226
That's a pigeon basket.

1:20:54.266 --> 1:20:58.897
Colin's great-grandfather
was a Pigeoneer.

1:22:20.686 --> 1:22:22.484
- Where's Wittekop?
- He's racing.

1:22:23.021 --> 1:22:24.739
In the Barcelona International.

1:22:25.315 --> 1:22:26.532
I want to talk to the Sheikh.

1:22:27.568 --> 1:22:29.696
Now. I want to talk to him now.

1:22:30.070 --> 1:22:31.196
What's the matter?

1:22:32.489 --> 1:22:33.911
What were you doing in my loft?

1:22:35.742 --> 1:22:38.495
I tricked Jos Pauwels into
selling Wittekop to you.

1:22:39.872 --> 1:22:41.499
What do you mean, you tricked him?

1:22:41.790 --> 1:22:44.276
I forced him into selling

1:22:44.376 --> 1:22:47.846
by threatening to destroy something
very dear to him and his granddaughter.

1:22:48.964 --> 1:22:51.262
- Does Mr. Walden know about this?
- No.

1:22:52.384 --> 1:22:54.978
You have to give that bird
back to its rightful owner.

1:22:56.305 --> 1:22:58.582
Mr. Pauwels is heartbroken
because of what I did.

1:22:58.682 --> 1:23:01.652
I want you to leave the estate.
Right now.

1:24:34.486 --> 1:24:35.658
Are you leaving?

1:24:36.154 --> 1:24:38.031
Yeah, I'm going back to New York.

1:24:38.365 --> 1:24:42.040
- No. You can't.
- Why not?

1:24:42.411 --> 1:24:45.210
Because I was looking for you
everywhere yesterday.

1:24:45.497 --> 1:24:50.003
I think that I know where your
great-grandfather is buried.

1:24:50.961 --> 1:24:54.306
- Do you know who Cher Ami is?
- No.

1:24:54.506 --> 1:24:57.555
Cher Ami was a famous war pigeon.

1:24:57.843 --> 1:25:01.973
He saved 600 British
soldiers in the Great War.

1:25:02.347 --> 1:25:04.520
It's... It's an incredible story.

1:25:05.726 --> 1:25:10.402
The British soldiers,
they were lost in enemy territory.

1:25:10.939 --> 1:25:14.944
And their only hope of survival

1:25:15.360 --> 1:25:18.364
was their last pigeon, Cher Ami.

1:25:19.531 --> 1:25:22.956
And the Germans, they saw the
bird take off and they opened fire.

1:25:23.201 --> 1:25:27.001
And it was hit several times,
but it kept on going.

1:25:27.497 --> 1:25:32.128
And it arrived at the
command post, one eye shot out,

1:25:32.461 --> 1:25:36.698
a bullet in his breast
and most of the leg

1:25:36.798 --> 1:25:40.553
that had the message
capsule attached missing.

1:25:41.511 --> 1:25:43.058
But the soldiers were saved.

1:25:44.014 --> 1:25:49.692
And Cher Ami, he received an Honorary
Service Cross and after he died,

1:25:49.978 --> 1:25:53.699
a small statue was mounted in its honor

1:25:54.232 --> 1:25:56.360
on a little cemetery here.

1:25:58.278 --> 1:26:03.876
And I'm convinced that your
great-grandfather is resting there.

1:27:13.645 --> 1:27:16.990
Good morning. Could I speak
to Mr. Pauwels, please?

1:27:17.691 --> 1:27:19.034
What can I do for you?

1:27:19.776 --> 1:27:24.532
Mr. Pauwels, it's an honor for me to meet
such a great pigeon fancier as yourself.

1:27:26.158 --> 1:27:28.286
I was wondering if we could
have a word together.

1:27:28.910 --> 1:27:31.021
You have already what you want, no?

1:27:31.121 --> 1:27:33.465
That's exactly what I wanted
to talk to you about.

1:27:33.999 --> 1:27:35.342
Come inside.

1:28:00.734 --> 1:28:02.010
Would you like some sugar?

1:28:02.110 --> 1:28:03.862
Three teaspoons, please.

1:28:06.531 --> 1:28:11.144
I'm sorry to intrude in such an early hour,
but I'd like to be back in Euskirchen

1:28:11.244 --> 1:28:13.588
when my birds return from Barcelona.

1:28:15.373 --> 1:28:17.717
- Wittekop is racing also.
- What?

1:28:18.752 --> 1:28:20.675
You're racing him in the Barcelona?

1:28:21.713 --> 1:28:22.805
Why not?

1:28:23.548 --> 1:28:27.724
You don't race a bird that comes from
another loft over such a great distance.

1:28:28.637 --> 1:28:31.561
- It will get lost.
- Wittekop can do it.

1:28:31.723 --> 1:28:32.770
Who says so?

1:28:34.100 --> 1:28:36.603
You'd never take the risk if
you would care for that bird.

1:28:37.270 --> 1:28:40.695
What is it with you people?
You think I'm a heartless person?

1:28:40.941 --> 1:28:45.321
Yes. You and your friend,
Mr. Montgomery.

1:28:46.404 --> 1:28:49.999
My grandfather is heartbroken
because he has lost his bird.

1:28:50.158 --> 1:28:53.253
I know that. Mr. Montgomery
has told me this last night.

1:28:54.746 --> 1:28:56.168
He was with you, was he?

1:28:56.873 --> 1:29:01.049
Were you two celebrating on how you fooled
a couple of simple-minded Belgians?

1:29:01.670 --> 1:29:02.904
Quite the opposite.

1:29:03.004 --> 1:29:06.759
He came to try and convince me to
return Wittekop to your grandfather.

1:29:08.760 --> 1:29:11.183
He says you never intended
to sell it. Is that correct?

1:29:13.598 --> 1:29:15.441
Yes. It is, yeah.

1:29:15.934 --> 1:29:19.484
He also says he tricked you
into selling the bird to me.

1:29:21.481 --> 1:29:22.653
He did.

1:29:24.484 --> 1:29:26.202
What a fool.

1:29:26.403 --> 1:29:29.703
He must realize this will be the
end of his promising career.

1:29:34.452 --> 1:29:37.376
He must care for you a
great deal, Mr. Pauwels.

1:29:39.082 --> 1:29:43.963
I'm not so sure that I'm
the one he cares about.

1:29:45.046 --> 1:29:47.014
Do you know where he is now?

1:29:47.299 --> 1:29:48.346
No.

1:29:48.675 --> 1:29:51.053
I kicked him off my property last night.

1:29:57.142 --> 1:29:59.986
I'd go and look for him if I were you.

1:30:04.649 --> 1:30:06.117
Where is she going?

1:30:06.234 --> 1:30:08.487
She flies to the one she loves.

1:30:32.844 --> 1:30:34.346
- Is Colin here?
- No.

1:30:34.512 --> 1:30:36.623
He packed his bags
this morning and left.

1:30:36.723 --> 1:30:39.602
- Where to?
- Back to New York, he said.

1:30:39.726 --> 1:30:43.981
I told him I think I know which cemetery
his great-grandfather is buried at,

1:30:44.105 --> 1:30:46.028
but he didn't seem to care anymore.

1:30:46.191 --> 1:30:49.761
- Which cemetery?
- Croonaert Chapel Cemetery.

1:30:49.861 --> 1:30:52.831
- Yes, but where is it?
- Right here, in Heuvelland.

1:30:54.866 --> 1:30:56.459
Do you want my moped?

1:32:10.191 --> 1:32:11.613
Is this the grave?

1:32:14.696 --> 1:32:17.449
Yeah, this one right here.

1:32:20.618 --> 1:32:22.291
Stewart Montgomery?

1:32:25.874 --> 1:32:27.376
I'm not the guy you think I am.

1:32:31.171 --> 1:32:32.423
Yes, you are.

1:32:35.175 --> 1:32:37.678
You're exactly the guy I think you are.

1:32:52.442 --> 1:32:54.285
I'm happy to see you.

1:32:55.695 --> 1:32:58.223
He's at least an hour and a half early.

1:32:58.323 --> 1:32:59.745
Yeah.

1:33:00.408 --> 1:33:03.833
He did a great time,
but he flew to the wrong loft.

1:33:04.996 --> 1:33:06.748
So he will be disqualified.

1:33:08.291 --> 1:33:09.668
Then let's try again next year.

1:33:12.670 --> 1:33:14.263
Do you accept my proposal?

1:33:15.882 --> 1:33:17.759
Shall we work together in the future?

1:33:19.511 --> 1:33:20.763
He can live here?

1:33:22.263 --> 1:33:23.856
This is his home.
