WEBVTT

00:02.535 --> 00:03.736
- What's that thing?

00:03.738 --> 00:05.371
- It's a coin sorter.

00:05.373 --> 00:07.272
Herminsons are having
a garage sale,

00:07.274 --> 00:09.575
And you know how I feel
about loose change:

00:09.577 --> 00:13.779
Not for me.

00:13.781 --> 00:14.780
- Ugh.

00:14.782 --> 00:16.648
Something else we don't need.

00:16.650 --> 00:19.618
Your father's been bringing home
useless junk for 40 years.

00:19.620 --> 00:23.155
- You were item number one.

00:25.492 --> 00:27.793
- We should be having
a garage sale, frank.

00:27.795 --> 00:28.794
- No.

00:28.796 --> 00:31.096
No garage sale.

00:31.098 --> 00:32.798
I'm not lugging everything
up from the basement

00:32.800 --> 00:37.269
And then standing out there
all day dealing with people.

00:37.271 --> 00:39.705
People.

00:39.707 --> 00:42.474
- I bet ed's making a lot
of money on that thing.

00:42.476 --> 00:44.276
- He told me
he already made $200.

00:44.278 --> 00:45.277
- Ooh.

00:45.279 --> 00:47.279
- $200?

00:47.281 --> 00:50.049
For herminson's crap?

00:50.051 --> 00:54.053
We got much better crap
than him.

00:54.055 --> 00:56.221
We're having
a garage sale.

00:56.223 --> 00:57.489
No, no, better.

00:57.491 --> 00:59.558
Make it a yard sale.

00:59.560 --> 01:00.793
That's classier.

01:00.795 --> 01:03.495
I bet I can sell this thing
for $15.

01:03.497 --> 01:05.164
That's pure profit.

01:05.166 --> 01:06.665
- Hey, who took my thing, dad?

01:06.667 --> 01:08.200
- Hey, listen up.

01:08.202 --> 01:09.701
You and robert
got till tomorrow morning

01:09.703 --> 01:11.236
At 8:00 in the a.M.
To get all the crap

01:11.238 --> 01:12.738
You're storing
in this house out.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.540
We're clearing the place out.

01:14.542 --> 01:15.541
- Oh, my god.

01:15.543 --> 01:18.077
You're moving?

01:18.079 --> 01:21.146
- No, we're having a yard sale.

01:21.148 --> 01:22.648
- Oh, oh, yard sale.

01:22.650 --> 01:24.650
Oh, for a second
I thought you were moving,

01:24.652 --> 01:28.187
Which would make us
so, so sad.

01:28.189 --> 01:29.555
- Aww.

01:29.557 --> 01:31.390
No, sweetie.

01:31.392 --> 01:34.726
We're not going anywhere, no.

01:34.728 --> 01:36.095
Oh.

01:36.097 --> 01:37.329
[smooches]

01:37.331 --> 01:39.865
No,
we'll always be with you.

01:47.841 --> 01:49.875
- 'cause I'll help you move.

01:54.581 --> 01:56.348
- Let's go.
Let's go.

01:56.350 --> 01:57.483
Got a half an hour.

01:57.485 --> 01:58.484
- Yeah, relax.

01:58.486 --> 02:02.454
- Move it out!

02:02.456 --> 02:03.856
- Take it easy, dad,
all right?

02:03.858 --> 02:05.624
Nobody's at your yard sale yet.

02:05.626 --> 02:09.294
The bowling alleys
are still open.

02:09.296 --> 02:12.531
- Well, anything
you don't claim, I'm selling.

02:12.533 --> 02:14.399
- Hey, listen,
if we don't want it for free,

02:14.401 --> 02:16.735
What makes you think people
are gonna pay for it?

02:16.737 --> 02:18.837
- People are idiots.

02:22.609 --> 02:24.343
- Did you know
I used to come down here

02:24.345 --> 02:25.477
To hide from you?

02:25.479 --> 02:26.812
- Oh, yeah?

02:26.814 --> 02:30.282
I used to come down here
to hide from dad.

02:30.284 --> 02:33.752
- He used to come down
to hide from mom.

02:33.754 --> 02:37.389
- Remember when we all ended up
down here at the same time?

02:37.391 --> 02:41.560
- Then mom locked us in
to teach us a lesson.

02:41.562 --> 02:43.162
- And dad shut off the water

02:43.164 --> 02:46.665
While she was still
in the shower.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.267
- Yeah.

02:48.269 --> 02:49.501
- Good times.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.537
- [chuckles]
yeah.

02:51.539 --> 02:53.639
- All right,
let's get to it, huh?

02:53.641 --> 02:55.908
- Oh, oh, man.

02:55.910 --> 02:56.875
You know what,
this is just--

02:56.877 --> 02:58.443
It's too much like work.

02:58.445 --> 02:59.645
Look, just let dad sell
what's ever here.

02:59.647 --> 03:00.779
That's all.

03:00.781 --> 03:02.181
- What, are you kidding?

03:02.183 --> 03:03.615
This is our childhood.

03:03.617 --> 03:05.517
This is who we are.

03:05.519 --> 03:08.854
- Hey, hey, hey,
my handprint turkey.

03:08.856 --> 03:11.957
Gully, gully, gully,
gah, gah, gah, gah.

03:11.959 --> 03:13.225
[chuckles]

03:13.227 --> 03:14.693
- That's a turkey?

03:14.695 --> 03:15.627
- Yeah, you know,
I was a kid.

03:15.629 --> 03:16.962
- Yeah, uh-huh.

03:16.964 --> 03:18.430
- Ahh, look at this.
Look at all this--

03:18.432 --> 03:21.300
All this cool school stuff
of mine.

03:21.302 --> 03:22.801
- Where's my stuff?

03:22.803 --> 03:23.869
- Ahh, look at this.

03:23.871 --> 03:26.438
I invented this in shop class.

03:26.440 --> 03:29.875
- You invented wood.

03:29.877 --> 03:32.344
- It's a bug-killing system.

03:32.346 --> 03:33.946
Look, I wrote directions down.

03:33.948 --> 03:36.915
"put bug on block 'a'
and press down with block 'b'

03:36.917 --> 03:40.752
"until crunching is heard.

03:40.754 --> 03:44.790
Rinse and repeat."

03:44.792 --> 03:46.525
- All these boxes
say "ray" on 'em.

03:46.527 --> 03:47.726
I used to have things too,
you know.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.261
- Here you go.

03:49.263 --> 03:50.395
Here's something
with your name on it.

03:50.397 --> 03:51.997
- What?

03:56.703 --> 03:57.970
- Your baby shoes?

04:02.275 --> 04:04.910
- 40 years,
this is all they saved.

04:04.912 --> 04:07.479
- Hey, hey, hey.

04:07.481 --> 04:09.815
Hector von fuzzy pants.

04:09.817 --> 04:13.719
[giggling]

04:13.721 --> 04:14.720
Or something.

04:14.722 --> 04:16.421
I don't--
hector von some--

04:16.423 --> 04:19.591
I don't know.
Oh, it's stupid.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.593
- All right.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.562
Come on,
hurry up, boys.

04:23.564 --> 04:25.430
Your father
wants a staff meeting

04:25.432 --> 04:28.267
On the lawn
in five minutes.

04:28.269 --> 04:29.801
- Ma, what are you doing?

04:29.803 --> 04:31.570
What are you selling
all this stuff for?

04:31.572 --> 04:33.672
- 'cause I need this area
for your father.

04:33.674 --> 04:36.842
See, I'm gonna bring down
a chair and a television,

04:36.844 --> 04:40.612
And I'm gonna leave meals
at the top of the stairs.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.714
He'll be very happy.

04:42.716 --> 04:44.449
- Ma, ma, wait.

04:44.451 --> 04:45.751
- What?
- What's with these shoes?

04:45.753 --> 04:47.352
What'd you save these for?

04:47.354 --> 04:49.621
- I don't know.
Let me see.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.356
[gasps]

04:51.358 --> 04:54.860
Oh, I bought these for you
for christmas one year.

04:54.862 --> 04:58.430
- I never got 'em.

04:58.432 --> 04:59.831
- I must have hidden them
down here

04:59.833 --> 05:02.634
And forgotten
to give them to you.

05:02.636 --> 05:03.835
[laughs]

05:03.837 --> 05:05.604
That's funny.

05:12.812 --> 05:16.648
- Shoes for christmas.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.617
- [mouthing words]

05:27.527 --> 05:28.827
- Oh.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.729
What's all that?

05:30.731 --> 05:33.765
- This is my whole childhood
that my parents want to sell

05:33.767 --> 05:37.002
To any zeke with a pickup.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.904
- Now, where are we
gonna keep all this stuff?

05:38.906 --> 05:39.905
- Come on, debra.

05:39.907 --> 05:41.640
This is--it's good stuff.

05:41.642 --> 05:44.509
- Oh, look.

05:44.511 --> 05:47.546
"ray, 1969," oh.

05:47.548 --> 05:48.814
- It's an ashtray.
I made it for my dad.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.048
Said he loved it.

05:50.050 --> 05:53.585
Said he would start smoking.

05:53.587 --> 05:55.921
He never did.

05:55.923 --> 05:58.924
- Well, when the time comes,
you'll smoke for your children.

05:58.926 --> 06:00.459
- What do you got there?

06:00.461 --> 06:01.593
- Oh, it's just a bunch
of clothing

06:01.595 --> 06:02.593
The kids have grown out of.

06:02.595 --> 06:04.629
I was just gonna take it over
to the yard sale.

06:04.631 --> 06:06.365
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:06.367 --> 06:07.466
Come on, kids.

06:07.468 --> 06:09.434
Got to go to grandma
and grandpa's.

06:09.436 --> 06:11.770
Ray,
just grab that crib, okay?

06:11.772 --> 06:14.506
Oh, come on.

06:14.508 --> 06:15.674
Go on, ray.
Hurry up.

06:15.676 --> 06:17.542
- We're getting rid
of the cribs?

06:17.544 --> 06:19.611
- Yeah, what do we need them
for anymore?

06:19.613 --> 06:20.712
- I don't know.

06:20.714 --> 06:21.713
- What?

06:21.715 --> 06:23.815
- I don't know,
in case--

06:23.817 --> 06:25.817
- What, for what?

06:25.819 --> 06:29.821
- I don't know.

06:29.823 --> 06:31.656
- What, for all the other kids
we're gonna have?

06:31.658 --> 06:36.495
Yeah, why don't we have ten more
and move into a shoe?

06:46.439 --> 06:48.440
Hey, frank.
- Hey, hey.

06:48.442 --> 06:49.975
Welcome to honest frank's
yard of bargains.

06:49.977 --> 06:51.676
- Oh, yeah.
- Hiya, kids.

06:51.678 --> 06:52.711
- Here we go.

06:52.713 --> 06:54.045
- Okay, what have we here,
debra?

06:54.047 --> 06:55.814
- Well,
it's mostly baby stuff.

06:55.816 --> 06:56.814
- Okay, let's see.

06:58.952 --> 07:00.719
- Clothes in clothes.
- Right.

07:00.721 --> 07:01.920
- All right, hey.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.955
Maybe I ought to start
an all-baby section.

07:03.957 --> 07:04.956
[chuckles]

07:04.958 --> 07:07.192
They're suckers for babies.

07:07.194 --> 07:08.560
- You know what, dad?

07:08.562 --> 07:11.696
We'll take care of all of this,
all right?

07:11.698 --> 07:13.565
So we're gonna get rid
of all this stuff, huh?

07:13.567 --> 07:15.434
- Yeah, and after your dad
takes his cut,

07:15.436 --> 07:17.969
We get to keep 40%.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.771
- Hey, hey, check this out.

07:19.773 --> 07:20.771
This thermos--
look at this.

07:20.773 --> 07:23.108
- Dad, all right, can you
give us a second here, please?

07:23.110 --> 07:24.176
- You see what I did?

07:24.178 --> 07:25.911
I scraped the rust off.

07:25.913 --> 07:28.146
Eye appeal is buy appeal.

07:28.148 --> 07:29.681
20 bucks.

07:29.683 --> 07:31.082
- 20 bucks?

07:31.084 --> 07:32.784
Nobody's gonna pay
that for a used thermos.

07:32.786 --> 07:35.053
- They will if it was used
by the pope.

07:35.055 --> 07:36.788
Hey, fella, you catholic?

07:36.790 --> 07:40.525
You like hot soup?

07:40.527 --> 07:43.462
- Wow, I can't believe
we saved all this stuff, huh?

07:43.464 --> 07:44.596
What do you think, ray?

07:44.598 --> 07:46.932
Like, a buck
for a bag of bibs?

07:46.934 --> 07:48.767
Buck a bag of bibs.

07:48.769 --> 07:49.768
Buck
a bag of bibs.

07:49.770 --> 07:50.902
A buck a bag of bibs.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.103
Can you say that?
Just say it.

07:52.105 --> 07:53.538
Buck a bag of bibs.
Buck a bag of bibs.

07:53.540 --> 07:54.706
- Yeah, okay, look.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.908
So we're not gonna
have any more kids?

07:56.910 --> 07:58.877
- What, are you serious?

07:58.879 --> 08:00.712
- I'm just--I'm wondering.

08:00.714 --> 08:01.713
- I don't know.

08:01.715 --> 08:03.148
Are we supposed to?

08:03.150 --> 08:04.583
- I don't know.

08:04.585 --> 08:06.485
I mean, I just--
I thought that if we weren't

08:06.487 --> 08:09.054
We both would have known
about it.

08:09.056 --> 08:10.989
- [clears throat]

08:10.991 --> 08:15.160
I don't think this is the place
to talk about this right now.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.862
- Oh, I wasn't listening.

08:23.836 --> 08:26.638
- Listen.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.840
I'm not saying
I definitely want more kids,

08:28.842 --> 08:30.942
But I just didn't know
we had made that decision.

08:30.944 --> 08:33.278
- Well, I mean, nobody made
an actual decision, ray.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.779
- I just thought that--

08:34.781 --> 08:36.781
I thought since we hadn't
done anything drastic--

08:36.783 --> 08:37.849
- Drastic?

08:37.851 --> 08:40.919
- Yes, you know,
since we hadn't...

08:40.921 --> 08:44.956
Snip, snip, snip, snip,

08:44.958 --> 08:46.992
That we could maybe--

08:46.994 --> 08:48.026
- What?

08:48.028 --> 08:49.060
- I don't know.

08:49.062 --> 08:51.062
Maybe we could have more kids.

08:51.064 --> 08:52.864
- Excuse me,
I couldn't help overhearing.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.966
- Oh, god.

08:54.968 --> 08:56.735
- Are we talking about
having more children?

08:56.737 --> 08:58.036
- Ray.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.038
- Ma, look, this is between
me and debra, okay?

09:00.040 --> 09:04.776
- Yeah, and I don't think that
this is the place to do this.

09:04.778 --> 09:06.278
- Raymond, what did you mean

09:06.280 --> 09:10.682
By "snip, snip,
snip, snip, snip"?

09:10.684 --> 09:13.318
- God, now I got to have
that dream.

09:18.824 --> 09:20.559
What are you doing?

09:20.561 --> 09:24.996
- Dad wants me to keep an eye
on that one in sporting goods.

09:24.998 --> 09:26.298
- You really think
mrs. Scarpool

09:26.300 --> 09:28.667
Is gonna steal
cross-country skis?

09:28.669 --> 09:33.204
- Not on my watch.

09:33.206 --> 09:36.341
- Hey, you two porcupines,

09:36.343 --> 09:38.109
I need you
to bring that sofa bed

09:38.111 --> 09:38.910
Up from the basement.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.745
- Old lucky?

09:40.747 --> 09:43.081
I mean, old musty?

09:43.083 --> 09:44.883
- Listen, I haven't told
your mother yet,

09:44.885 --> 09:49.955
But I'm fixing a little area
for her down there.

09:49.957 --> 09:51.590
- A little area.

09:51.592 --> 09:53.091
- I'm gonna bring down
her sewing machine,

09:53.093 --> 09:55.660
Maybe a folding chair,
maybe a hot plate.

09:55.662 --> 09:56.962
She'll love it.

09:56.964 --> 10:00.198
She can stay down there
all day.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.767
- Sounds like a sweatshop, dad.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.769
- Nah, I'll give her
a little fan.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.040
- Debra, would you help me
price these things?

10:09.042 --> 10:11.209
If we look busy,
then nobody'll bother us.

10:11.211 --> 10:12.611
- Oh, that doesn't work.

10:12.613 --> 10:16.114
I just was trying
to look busy.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.716
- Can I let you in
on a little secret?

10:17.718 --> 10:18.984
- Um...

10:18.986 --> 10:21.086
- I wanted to have
more children too.

10:21.088 --> 10:23.655
- We don't want
to have more children.

10:23.657 --> 10:24.956
- Oh?

10:24.958 --> 10:28.893
Well, if I overheard correctly,
raymond does.

10:28.895 --> 10:30.095
Listen.

10:30.097 --> 10:32.998
I wanted to have another baby,

10:33.000 --> 10:34.899
But frank wouldn't
even hear of it.

10:34.901 --> 10:37.202
And well, I was just crushed.

10:37.204 --> 10:38.703
You know, I love my boys,

10:38.705 --> 10:42.841
But I always wanted
a little girl too.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.943
You know what I used to do?

10:44.945 --> 10:47.312
I used to put robbie
in a little pink dress

10:47.314 --> 10:48.813
And dance him
around the room.

10:53.085 --> 10:56.921
- You got any pictures of that?

10:56.923 --> 10:58.990
- The reason
I bring it up is that,

10:58.992 --> 11:02.093
Well, we're not getting
any younger, dear.

11:02.095 --> 11:05.930
And you want to plant your
seedlings before winter comes

11:05.932 --> 11:07.365
And everything freezes over.

11:07.367 --> 11:11.136
- Jeez.

11:11.138 --> 11:14.739
- You can't talk to her.

11:14.741 --> 11:15.907
- All right, easy, easy.

11:15.909 --> 11:17.242
Stop pushing it, robert.

11:17.244 --> 11:18.243
- I'm not pushing.

11:18.245 --> 11:19.811
- Take--I'm losing my grip.

11:19.813 --> 11:21.046
I'm put--I'm putting it down.

11:21.048 --> 11:22.447
- Wait, wait, wait!
- I'm putting it down.

11:22.449 --> 11:23.448
Clunk!

11:23.450 --> 11:25.283
- Ow!

11:25.285 --> 11:26.718
- Well, what's the matter?

11:26.720 --> 11:27.718
I told you
I'm putting it down.

11:27.720 --> 11:29.354
- You told me
while you were putting it down.

11:29.356 --> 11:30.789
- Oh, you just--you're slow.

11:30.791 --> 11:31.789
That's all.
- Yeah, yeah.

11:31.791 --> 11:33.391
You used to do that to me
on the seesaw.

11:33.393 --> 11:37.128
"I'm getting off,"
boom.

11:37.130 --> 11:41.332
- Hey, chuckleheads,
this ain't the employee lounge.

11:41.334 --> 11:43.835
I got a rube out there
I think I can unload this on.

11:43.837 --> 11:45.070
- All right, take it easy, dad.

11:45.072 --> 11:46.871
This thing weighs a ton,
all right?

11:46.873 --> 11:49.340
- Well, then open it up
and pull the mattress out.

11:49.342 --> 11:54.079
What, are you two
sharing a brain?

11:54.081 --> 11:56.748
I'll use this cushion
to keep him on the hook.

11:56.750 --> 11:59.017
[groans]

11:59.019 --> 12:00.885
Ick.

12:00.887 --> 12:03.121
There you go.

12:03.123 --> 12:07.058
- All right.
- All right.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.293
[grunting]

12:08.295 --> 12:09.294
- Ready, one...

12:09.296 --> 12:10.295
- Yeah.

12:10.297 --> 12:11.930
- Two, three.

12:11.932 --> 12:14.032
[dishes crashing]

12:22.408 --> 12:27.045
- We were too close
to the table.

12:27.047 --> 12:27.946
- Stupid couch,
stupid--

12:27.948 --> 12:29.147
Stupid.

12:29.149 --> 12:30.949
- Hey.

12:30.951 --> 12:33.418
Don't take your problems
with debra out on the sofa bed.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.353
- What are you talking about?

12:35.355 --> 12:38.423
- I know the situation.

12:38.425 --> 12:41.192
You know, the kid thing,
you and debra.

12:41.194 --> 12:43.228
- Well, where'd you hear that?

12:43.230 --> 12:45.363
- It's all over the yard.

12:48.067 --> 12:49.334
- What?

12:49.336 --> 12:50.902
- Don't worry.

12:50.904 --> 12:53.505
What's said in the yard
stays in the yard.

12:53.507 --> 12:54.505
- I don't believe this.
