[Pidge] This is Katie Holt,
Paladin of the Green Voltron Lion,

01:14.991 --> 01:15.992
broadcasting to Earth.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.536
Does anyone copy? Over.

01:19.954 --> 01:21.122
[display beeping]

01:22.082 --> 01:24.751
I repeat,
this is the Paladin of the Green Lion

01:24.834 --> 01:27.170
and part of the Voltron Coalition.

01:27.253 --> 01:29.714
If you hear me, please respond. Over.

01:29.798 --> 01:31.382
[static crackling]

01:34.803 --> 01:36.054
Dad, are you there?

02:04.290 --> 02:07.335
-What are you looking at?
-Oh, hey.

02:07.418 --> 02:08.419
[chuckles]

02:08.502 --> 02:13.007
Didn't see you there-- right there.
I'm just checking out the Lion.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.552
[Hunk] A good pilot can tell you

02:15.635 --> 02:18.346
everything you need to know
by a solid visual inspection.

02:18.429 --> 02:21.516
It's time consuming, yes, and it takes
impeccable attention to detail,

02:21.599 --> 02:23.518
but it's worth it, trust me.

02:23.601 --> 02:24.727
Amazing.

02:25.603 --> 02:28.606
Hunk, I just ran a multi-lion
system diagnostic test.

02:28.690 --> 02:31.526
The report back showed
that the faunatonium partially replenished

02:31.609 --> 02:33.653
the power cores,
but they're still not at 100 percent,

02:33.736 --> 02:35.905
so we'll need to take it slow.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.575
Yep, "partially replenished" power core.
Nailed it.

02:38.658 --> 02:40.535
That's pretty much what I got, too.

02:41.786 --> 02:43.538
Were you able to contact Earth?

02:44.205 --> 02:45.165
No luck.

02:45.248 --> 02:48.751
The low power levels are probably
affecting our broadcast distance.

02:48.835 --> 02:53.214
-I'll keep trying as we head for Earth.
-I can't believe we're finally going home.

02:54.299 --> 02:56.676
I'm gonna hug my parents and never let go.

02:56.759 --> 03:00.930
I can't wait to see how Dad integrated
Altean and Earth technologies together.

03:01.014 --> 03:04.309
I bet he came up with something amazing.
And my mom...

03:05.184 --> 03:08.438
oh, she's gonna be so mad at me
for running away.

03:09.314 --> 03:10.899
I hope I'm not grounded.

03:12.775 --> 03:15.028
How long you think it'll take us
to get home?

03:15.778 --> 03:17.530
I was just calculating that now.

03:17.614 --> 03:21.117
Without the luxury of a wormhole
and with diminished power cores,

03:21.200 --> 03:23.328
let me see, carry the one...

03:23.411 --> 03:27.165
oh, it's gonna take us approximately
150,000 Earth years.

03:27.248 --> 03:30.960
-[all gasping]
-A hundred and fifty thousand years?

03:31.044 --> 03:33.755
Coran, I think your finger counting
is a little off.

03:33.838 --> 03:35.465
-It's gonna be 1.5 years.
-[all groaning]

03:37.926 --> 03:39.677
Oh, right. I didn't carry the three.

03:40.261 --> 03:43.014
It's going to be a very long
and difficult voyage,

03:43.097 --> 03:46.184
but it's our only chance to replace
the Castle of Lions.

03:46.976 --> 03:49.646
There were times when I thought
I'd never see Earth again.

03:50.104 --> 03:51.481
To be able to go back--

03:51.564 --> 03:54.692
Well, what are we waiting for, guys?
Let's hit the space road.

03:55.652 --> 03:58.071
I suppose we need to figure out
who's flying with whom.

03:58.738 --> 04:00.281
And what about the animals?

04:00.365 --> 04:01.366
What about them?

04:01.449 --> 04:04.994
[Coran] Well, the Wolf can't go
with Kaltenecker, wolves eat cows.

04:05.078 --> 04:08.665
Cow can't be in the same area as the mice
because aren't cows afraid of mice?

04:08.748 --> 04:11.000
No, elephants are afraid of mice.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.585
-Elephants?
-Yeah.

04:12.669 --> 04:15.588
They're giant, gray animals
with long noses that grab things.

04:15.672 --> 04:20.343
Giants with long, grabbing noses?
Earth seems so strange.

04:20.885 --> 04:24.430
The wolf is riding with me, but that
means Hunk will have to take the cow.

04:25.014 --> 04:27.058
Me with the cow? Not a good idea.

04:27.684 --> 04:29.602
Hunk's right.
Keith, you're keeping the cow.

04:29.686 --> 04:31.854
Someone else is gonna have
to take the wolf.

04:34.023 --> 04:35.858
Not me. I am allergic.

04:36.359 --> 04:37.944
I'll take the mice.

04:38.027 --> 04:39.988
How come you get the smallest passengers?

04:41.197 --> 04:43.825
I say we go old school and draw straws.

04:43.908 --> 04:46.744
-But I'm terrible at drawing.
-She really is.

04:47.370 --> 04:50.498
One time, she tried to draw her Nan-nan,
but what she came up with,

04:50.581 --> 04:53.209
I've gotta say it looked more like
a flan-bil-diplor.

04:54.085 --> 04:58.798
Guys, you're all overthinking this.
I know exactly where everyone should go.

05:03.511 --> 05:04.804
[chittering]

05:09.309 --> 05:11.185
Hunk and mice, ready to go.

05:14.647 --> 05:18.609
I'm ready too.
But the wolf looks restless.

05:19.110 --> 05:21.112
How did I get stuck with it again?

05:21.696 --> 05:24.324
-I'd gladly trade you the wolf for--
-I have a question.

05:24.407 --> 05:27.618
-Why did we let Lance decide all this?
-Enough whining!

05:28.286 --> 05:31.539
Romelle and I are going to Earth,
who's coming with us?

05:32.290 --> 05:34.083
[power surges]

06:08.242 --> 06:09.118
Ah.

06:11.579 --> 06:15.291
This is so great. You guys are like
the ultimate road trip companions.

06:15.374 --> 06:19.337
Oh, and I get to finally play some of
your Earth road games. I'll go first.

06:19.420 --> 06:23.758
I spy with my little eye
something that starts with "plexis."

06:23.841 --> 06:26.052
Coran, we don't know the Altean alphabet.

It's jaw-blade,

06:39.690 --> 06:42.151
Romelle, come on.
This is a dangerous war machine.

What if you have to go to the bathroom

06:45.321 --> 06:46.948
and you break your leg
and then we're attacked,

06:47.031 --> 06:48.574

06:50.368 --> 06:52.078
Lance, check it out. Ah!

06:52.161 --> 06:56.707
I'm being attacked by giant mice.
Stop! They're eating my face.

Just let him in the cockpit.

Yeah. Wait, who's in her lion again?

I don't know, you're the one
that came up with this grouping.

08:23.002 --> 08:25.755
Well, she must have--
no, they're with Keith.

08:25.838 --> 08:28.799
And the wolf is with Allura,
I have the mice.

08:28.883 --> 08:30.760

Oh, come on, guys, this is so not fair.

08:35.431 --> 08:38.100
I call dibs on playing

08:38.183 --> 08:39.894
But I already have the controller.

08:39.977 --> 08:41.687
[Coran] Pidge, tell Romelle
to give me the controller.

08:41.770 --> 08:42.688
I called it first.

08:42.772 --> 08:45.566
[Pidge] No. Nope. Nuh-uh. No way.
Can't do this.

08:53.991 --> 08:56.160
[Krolia] This is the Klii-Nyn System.

08:56.244 --> 08:59.622
There's a Blade of Marmora rally point
located on a moon here.

09:00.206 --> 09:03.000
We should check in with them
and get an update on their operations.

been here for years.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.201
The system won't boot.

10:19.285 --> 10:22.079
Looks like the backup power
has been out for a while.

10:22.663 --> 10:25.041
If the Blade of Marmora
abandoned this place,

10:25.541 --> 10:27.877
that means something really bad
must have happened.

10:28.544 --> 10:29.920
[Krolia] That's impossible.

10:30.004 --> 10:33.507

10:56.530 --> 10:59.325
It looks like a small fleet.
Mostly Galra fighters.

10:59.408 --> 11:02.036
That's good. We should be able
to take them out pretty easily.

11:23.724 --> 11:24.850
Keep an eye out.

11:24.934 --> 11:27.186
Where there are fighters
there's usually a cruiser nearby.

11:37.029 --> 11:40.282
Some of these ships
look like they belong to Lotor's fleet.

12:40.217 --> 12:43.429
We're getting our quiznacks handed to us.
We need to do something.

12:43.512 --> 12:47.725
-We need to form Voltron.
-Okay. Everyone, in formation.

12:57.401 --> 12:58.819

enough power to form Voltron.

13:14.960 --> 13:15.961
So now what?

I've never seen the Galra
use weapons like these before.

Galra battle formations.

How are we gonna get away?

They're trying to trap us by chasing us
through this tunnel of crystals.

[Pidge] He's right.
Look, there are more crystals up ahead.

14:37.543 --> 14:40.045
[Hunk] They're corralling us
like we're space cattle.

14:40.129 --> 14:41.964
They backed us into a corner.

14:42.047 --> 14:45.134
We got xanthorium crystals all around us,
pirates behind us,

14:45.217 --> 14:47.136

[Keith] We have no choice.
Everyone into the cyclone.

14:57.521 --> 15:00.316
Hunk, that means you and I are gonna
have to punch a hole through the storm

15:00.399 --> 15:02.651
and create a path for the team. You ready?

for anything we can use for cover.

15:20.127 --> 15:22.796
We need to go somewhere
where we have the advantage.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.924
There's a volcanic ice planet nearby.

15:25.007 --> 15:27.801
It has geysers, steam vents, ice tunnels,

15:27.885 --> 15:31.180
extreme changes in temperature
and an unstable core.

15:31.263 --> 15:33.974

stay in formation and follow me.

16:53.053 --> 16:56.098
That gives me an idea.
Lance, bring up the rear.

16:56.181 --> 16:59.018
When everyone's through the tunnel,
fire above the cave opening.

16:59.101 --> 17:02.229
Red should be fast enough to get in before
the avalanche completely blocks the way.

17:02.312 --> 17:03.731
Roger that, team leader.

17:03.814 --> 17:05.648
[Keith] We'll see each other
on the other side.

17:11.821 --> 17:13.406
Here goes nothing.

17:13.490 --> 17:15.159
[display beeping]

17:28.047 --> 17:30.007
[Lance] Uh-oh! Some of them
still made it through.

17:30.966 --> 17:33.302
[Keith] Split up. We need to thin
our attackers.

17:55.157 --> 17:56.158
[display beeping]

17:56.825 --> 17:59.661
He's trying to break in.
I'll take care of him.

17:59.745 --> 18:02.247
No, you're still recovering. I'll do it.

18:03.248 --> 18:04.500
All right.

18:05.292 --> 18:06.835
[Keith] Wait!

18:06.919 --> 18:07.878
Take this.

18:12.299 --> 18:13.258
I'll help, too.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.804
Whoa! Ah!

18:18.472 --> 18:21.058
Hello? Krolia?

18:22.142 --> 18:25.938
Anyone? A little help here. Guys?

18:48.418 --> 18:49.545
[both grunt]

18:55.843 --> 18:57.594
[grunts] Hang on!

19:07.312 --> 19:08.772
[grunts]

19:21.577 --> 19:22.411
[groans]

19:29.585 --> 19:31.086
[thrusters revving]

19:35.591 --> 19:36.425
[grunting]

19:43.849 --> 19:45.517
[grunting]

19:47.102 --> 19:49.062
Ah!

20:07.331 --> 20:08.957
[explosion]

20:22.179 --> 20:23.889
Ah!

20:26.934 --> 20:28.143
Nice!

20:29.228 --> 20:31.605
-Oh, no.
-What are you waiting for? Shoot him.

20:31.688 --> 20:35.525
-I can't. The jaws are stuck shut.
-I'll take care of him.

20:43.575 --> 20:45.744
[grunting]

20:55.879 --> 20:56.713
[grunts]

21:01.218 --> 21:02.928
Allura, open the mouth.

21:04.554 --> 21:06.098
[screams]

21:08.725 --> 21:10.227
Is everyone okay?

21:10.310 --> 21:13.188
-Clear.
-Me too, thanks to Romelle.

21:13.272 --> 21:14.982
Well, Pidge and I need help.

21:15.065 --> 21:18.652
Yeah, we can't shake these guys
and we don't have any room to maneuver.

21:19.903 --> 21:22.322
I see your location.
We're headed your way.

21:26.743 --> 21:29.162
What should we do? You usually have ideas.

21:29.246 --> 21:32.040
I don't know. My cannon isn't operational.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.500
[grunting]

21:34.668 --> 21:36.837
Know what?
Let me know if you have any thoughts.

21:36.920 --> 21:38.755
We could really use some help right now.

21:45.304 --> 21:46.972
-[gasps]
-[snarling]

21:47.055 --> 21:47.931
[whimpering]

21:58.483 --> 21:59.985
[Lance] What just happened?

22:00.652 --> 22:03.113
I think the wolf just saved us.

22:04.823 --> 22:06.158
[chuckles]

22:06.241 --> 22:07.242
[wolf whimpering]

22:08.035 --> 22:09.911
Oh, no. Are you okay, wolfie?

22:10.746 --> 22:13.290
[pants, whimpers]

22:30.307 --> 22:32.350
[all grutning]
