WEBVTT

00:02.236 --> 00:03.051
Okay, Dad, move to your right.

00:03.087 --> 00:04.544
Ernie, to your left. Faster!

00:04.579 --> 00:05.887
Faster. You gotta move faster.

00:05.923 --> 00:06.729
Mom, you gotta
move your butt. Move it.

00:06.765 --> 00:10.584
Move it.

00:10.619 --> 00:13.153
KC, stop barking out
orders like we're on a mission.

00:13.188 --> 00:14.304
This is a dance revolution,
not an actual revolution.

00:14.339 --> 00:18.492
Yeah, and you tell me to
move my butt one more time,

00:18.527 --> 00:20.635
you won't be able
to sit on yours.

00:20.670 --> 00:23.105
I'm sorry, okay.
I don't know what's worse,

00:23.107 --> 00:25.107
losing Judy, not being able
to be a spy anymore,

00:25.142 --> 00:27.142
or watching Ernie
drop it like it's hot.

00:28.536 --> 00:30.145
And by the way, it's not.

00:33.224 --> 00:38.570
Well, I wouldn't really
have time to dance

00:38.605 --> 00:40.288
if you hadn't gotten us
kicked ol know, I know.ization.

00:40.323 --> 00:42.607
Okay, it's all my fault.

00:42.643 --> 00:43.583
Why don't we just blame
the whole thing on KC?

00:43.618 --> 00:45.577
That's what we're doing.

00:45.612 --> 00:47.587
I feel terrible,

00:47.622 --> 00:48.781
and I'm trying everything I can

00:48.816 --> 00:51.066
to get us back in,
and I promise,

00:51.101 --> 00:52.692
- I'm never gonna give up.
- That's my girl.

00:52.727 --> 00:54.052
Now do me a favor. Give up!

00:54.087 --> 00:56.537
It's been over a month.

00:56.573 --> 00:57.881
The Organization
isn't returning your calls.

00:57.917 --> 00:59.407
They're not answering emails.

00:59.442 --> 01:02.276
Based on my experience,
it sounds like

01:02.312 --> 01:04.012
they just wanna be friends,

01:04.047 --> 01:05.730
but they don't.

01:05.766 --> 01:07.357
Look, honey,

01:07.392 --> 01:10.126
Judy's been reassigned,
and we're not spies anymore.

01:10.162 --> 01:13.204
I know it's tough,

01:13.240 --> 01:15.040
but it's time that
we moved on with our lives.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.058
Your mother's right.

01:17.094 --> 01:19.534
Our days of excitement
and danger are over.

01:27.246 --> 01:28.686
( laughing )

01:28.722 --> 01:30.239
You did it, Jackal.

01:30.274 --> 01:31.815
The Coopers might have
put you away,

01:31.850 --> 01:33.366
but they couldn't
keep you locked up.

01:33.401 --> 01:35.343
I know.

01:35.378 --> 01:37.020
I only just spent ten months

01:37.055 --> 01:38.838
digging my way out.

01:38.874 --> 01:40.799
No prison can hold the Jackal.

01:42.594 --> 01:44.354
I'm comin' for you, Coopers.

01:46.698 --> 01:50.083
¶ Oh, when danger
comes for you ¶

01:50.118 --> 01:53.237
¶ You know
I'll stand beside you ¶

01:53.355 --> 01:57.482
¶ 'Cause ain't nobody
keep things hustle cool ¶

01:57.517 --> 02:01.336
¶ I'll always find a way,
a way out of the fire ¶

02:01.372 --> 02:04.998
¶ Don't tell nobody,
tell nobody ¶

02:05.033 --> 02:07.091
¶ I'm not perfect ¶

02:07.127 --> 02:11.162
¶ So many things
I wanna tell you ¶

02:11.197 --> 02:15.099
¶ But I, I, I,
I keep it undercover ¶

02:15.135 --> 02:17.168
¶ Livin' my life,
no way to learn ¶

02:17.203 --> 02:19.446
¶ Doin' my thing,
gonna make it work ¶

02:19.481 --> 02:21.881
¶ Know I'm the realest,
baby, I'm fearless ¶

02:21.917 --> 02:23.992
¶ But I always got your back ¶

02:24.027 --> 02:25.878
¶ Nobody can do it like I can ¶

02:25.913 --> 02:28.121
¶ I gotta find out who I am ¶

02:28.156 --> 02:30.799
¶ Ain't got to worry about me ¶

02:30.834 --> 02:31.900
¶ It's all part of the plan ¶

02:31.935 --> 02:34.219
I keep it undercover.

02:34.254 --> 02:35.854
I keep it undercover.

02:46.174 --> 02:47.673
Ernie, what are you wearing?

02:47.709 --> 02:49.701
Now that I'm no longer a spy,

02:49.737 --> 02:52.111
I've decided to be an inventor.

02:52.147 --> 02:54.272
Really? 'Cause it looks like
you've decided

02:54.307 --> 02:56.592
never to know
the touch of a woman.

02:56.594 --> 02:58.710
You happen to be looking
at a million-dollar idea.

02:58.745 --> 03:00.662
The jack-pack.

03:00.697 --> 03:03.431
One part jacket,
one part backpack.

03:03.466 --> 03:05.475
And two parts terrible.

03:05.510 --> 03:06.943
Where exactly are you
gonna sell it at?

03:06.979 --> 03:10.005
Bad Ideas R Us? ( Cackling )

03:10.040 --> 03:12.090
Hi, KC. How's it going?

03:12.125 --> 03:14.501
Oh, feeling great.
I feel amazing.

03:14.536 --> 03:17.287
In fact, I'm not thinking
about the Organization at all.

03:17.323 --> 03:20.056
Ernie's moving on
with his life, why can't I?

03:20.092 --> 03:22.391
Well, in order to move on
with your life,

03:22.427 --> 03:24.227
you had to have
had one in the first place.

03:24.262 --> 03:26.921
What are you talking about?

03:26.957 --> 03:28.373
For your information,
I was leading a double life.

03:28.409 --> 03:30.125
That's true.

03:30.160 --> 03:31.701
Unfortunately, one was secret,

03:31.737 --> 03:35.080
and the other one was boring.

03:35.115 --> 03:37.357
KC, you were so busy
trying to keep a low profile,

03:37.392 --> 03:39.000
people don't even know
you go to this school.

03:39.036 --> 03:41.861
That is all types of ridiculous.

03:41.896 --> 03:43.821
Hey, what's crackin', Marisa?

03:43.857 --> 03:45.298
What's up, new girl?

03:45.334 --> 03:47.951
Uh, Darien, it's KC.

03:47.986 --> 03:49.185
You've known me
since second grade.

03:49.220 --> 03:51.221
KC? I thought you died.

03:54.109 --> 03:58.336
Wait, if that wasn't you,
then whose funeral did I go to?

03:58.371 --> 04:00.496
What are you talking about?

04:00.532 --> 04:02.265
I sit next to you every day
in business class.

04:02.300 --> 04:03.825
Business class?
I don't think so.

04:03.860 --> 04:04.940
I've only flown coach.

04:07.097 --> 04:08.763
Anyways, gotta get
back to class.

04:08.798 --> 04:10.548
See you at the game,
right, Marisa?

04:10.584 --> 04:12.241
Oh, and glad you're
not dead, Katie.

04:12.277 --> 04:14.119
It's KC, and you know me!

04:18.049 --> 04:20.042
Okay, you're right.

04:20.077 --> 04:22.728
Um, excuse me?

04:22.763 --> 04:24.387
I said you were right.

04:24.422 --> 04:26.039
Oh, I know, it just
happens so rarely,

04:26.074 --> 04:27.699
I wanted to hear it again.

04:27.734 --> 04:30.944
I cannot believe
that people literally

04:30.979 --> 04:31.936
do not know who I am.

04:31.971 --> 04:34.131
I might as well be dead.

04:34.166 --> 04:36.291
If I'm not gonna be
a spy anymore,

04:36.326 --> 04:38.042
I can at least be someone
that people notice.

04:38.078 --> 04:40.737
Know what?

04:40.772 --> 04:42.072
It's time for a new me.

04:42.107 --> 04:44.399
Finally. Santa got my letters.

04:45.977 --> 04:48.011
Okay, new KC.

04:48.046 --> 04:50.321
Let's go hang out
with bad boys at the mall.

04:50.356 --> 04:53.324
I think Juvie Joey
will really like you.

04:53.359 --> 04:55.485
Marisa, I was thinking
about getting involved

04:55.520 --> 04:57.228
with something at school,

04:57.263 --> 04:59.548
so people know that I exist.

04:59.583 --> 05:02.259
Something like, uh...
like the math team.

05:02.336 --> 05:03.919
Sounds like the new you
is a lot like the old you.

05:03.954 --> 05:05.114
¶ Boring! ¶

05:10.752 --> 05:13.152
Hey!

05:13.188 --> 05:14.020
How many times
do I have to tell you

05:14.055 --> 05:15.663
use yesterday's teabag.

05:15.699 --> 05:17.765
Yesterday's teabag!

05:17.801 --> 05:19.792
I've been using
yesterday's teabag

05:19.828 --> 05:22.787
for five yesterdays.

05:22.822 --> 05:24.455
At this point, I'm just drinking
hot water with a hint of string.

05:24.491 --> 05:27.458
Well, I'm sorry,
but we need to cut back.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.619
Plus, tea is for
fancy people with jobs

05:29.654 --> 05:31.494
who can afford to heat water.

05:33.758 --> 05:36.376
Okay, Craig, look,
I know it's a tough time.

05:36.411 --> 05:38.286
Everything has changed,
and it's scary.

05:38.322 --> 05:39.629
Maybe we just need
a distraction.

05:39.664 --> 05:42.382
Something that'll keep us
busy but won't cost a cent.

05:42.417 --> 05:45.326
I know. Let's have another baby.

05:45.362 --> 05:48.438
That makes no sense,
and costs a lot of cents.

05:48.473 --> 05:52.467
- Oh, come on. We're good at babies.
- Absolutely not.

05:52.502 --> 05:55.270
Please. Just one itty-bitty
teeny-tiny little baby.

05:55.305 --> 05:57.914
Get away from me, crazy lady.

05:57.949 --> 05:58.998
You know what? You're right.

05:59.034 --> 06:01.534
I am acting crazy.

06:01.570 --> 06:03.878
I think it's because
I just miss Judy so much.

06:03.914 --> 06:06.614
It's okay, honey.

06:06.649 --> 06:09.743
Judy is with a new family now,

06:09.820 --> 06:12.220
and I'm sure they love her
just as much as we do.

06:15.209 --> 06:17.166
Morning, Agent Graham,
Agent Penelope.

06:17.201 --> 06:19.761
Soft-boiled eggs again?

06:19.796 --> 06:21.871
Deja pew!

06:24.334 --> 06:26.475
Can't you eat a scrambled egg
up in this joint?

06:26.511 --> 06:27.936
( British accent )
What do you care?

06:27.971 --> 06:29.754
You don't even eat.

06:29.790 --> 06:32.765
You're just a... machine.

06:32.801 --> 06:34.700
Interesting.

06:34.736 --> 06:36.578
You're the person,

06:36.613 --> 06:39.013
yet I'm the one
with the personality.

06:41.351 --> 06:44.285
Anywho...
when I lived with the Coopers,

06:44.321 --> 06:46.370
we used to talk at breakfast

06:46.406 --> 06:48.056
about our plans for the day.

06:48.091 --> 06:49.816
Yes, you've mentioned that

06:49.852 --> 06:52.811
for the past 37 days in a row.

06:52.846 --> 06:54.804
Actually, Judy, we do have

06:54.839 --> 06:57.399
a very important
assignment for you.

06:57.434 --> 06:59.025
Now we're talkin'.
What do you got?

06:59.060 --> 07:02.303
We want you to go into your box,

07:02.339 --> 07:05.039
and don't come out
until we call you.

07:05.074 --> 07:09.485
But that's the 37th time
that I've had that mission.

07:09.520 --> 07:12.447
Maybe this time,
you'll get it right.

07:12.482 --> 07:14.591
FYI, I don't like
you guys either.

07:20.373 --> 07:23.116
Well, I tried
to join the math team

07:23.152 --> 07:24.400
but then they said
I wasn't part of their equation,

07:24.435 --> 07:26.819
and then laughed hysterically.

07:26.854 --> 07:29.247
That is kind of funny.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.983
Math team, equation.

07:32.018 --> 07:34.477
They are mean.

07:34.512 --> 07:37.438
I also tried out
for the glee club,

07:37.474 --> 07:39.791
but they turned me down
because apparently,

07:39.826 --> 07:41.317
you have to be able
to "carry a tune."

07:41.352 --> 07:43.277
At least they didn't laugh.

07:43.313 --> 07:45.547
Oh, no, they laughed,
in three-part harmony.

07:45.549 --> 07:47.048
I tried to join in,
but then again, they're right.

07:47.083 --> 07:50.235
I can't carry a tune.

07:50.270 --> 07:52.645
I also tried out
for the debate team,

07:52.681 --> 07:54.948
and the yearbook committee,
but it's all taken

07:54.983 --> 07:57.058
because it's
the middle of the year.

07:57.060 --> 07:58.852
How am I supposed to
make a name for myself now?

07:58.929 --> 08:01.788
Don't worry. I have
a solution to your problems.

08:01.823 --> 08:04.023
Soon, everyone will be
talking about KC Cooper.

08:05.835 --> 08:09.437
Ta-da!

08:09.472 --> 08:11.982
And what exactly does this hand
towel have to do with anything?

08:12.017 --> 08:14.284
It's a dress.

08:14.319 --> 08:16.344
Marisa, I am not wearing that.

08:16.379 --> 08:18.379
I show less skin
to my dermatologist.

08:19.474 --> 08:22.108
But there is a dance coming up...

08:22.144 --> 08:24.035
Oh, yes, right, right.
The dance. Perfect.

08:24.070 --> 08:26.279
If you want everyone
to know who you are,

08:26.315 --> 08:27.755
why don't you just go with
a guy that everyone knows?

08:27.790 --> 08:29.424
Yeah, for sure, yeah.

08:29.459 --> 08:31.742
And maybe if that works out,

08:31.778 --> 08:33.261
he could offer my dad
two cows and a donkey

08:33.296 --> 08:35.037
for my hand in marriage.

08:35.073 --> 08:38.600
Marisa, I don't need a guy
to help me stand out, okay?

08:38.635 --> 08:40.468
I wanna be able to
stand out on my own.

08:40.503 --> 08:43.521
Well, the way you dance,
you'll definitely stand out.

08:43.556 --> 08:45.940
Okay, I get it.
I'm not a great dancer.

08:45.976 --> 08:47.183
But there is still a way for
me to be the center of attention

08:47.218 --> 08:48.518
at the dance.

08:51.798 --> 08:53.898
Put the postage stamp away.

08:56.811 --> 08:59.537
What I'm saying is,
I am going to deejay the dance.

08:59.572 --> 09:01.848
But they already have a deejay.

09:01.883 --> 09:03.091
DJ Mike. You must know who he is.
Everybody does.

09:03.126 --> 09:05.752
Oh, okay.

09:05.787 --> 09:07.747
Now I see why
you wanna be the deejay.

09:12.902 --> 09:15.637
How's your day going, guv'nors?

09:15.672 --> 09:19.649
That information is classified.

09:19.684 --> 09:23.094
I don't know why the Pilgrims
wanted to get away from y'all.

09:27.208 --> 09:29.459
Ooh, the Real House-boos
marathon.

09:29.494 --> 09:33.396
Who's your favorite
house-boo... boo?

09:33.432 --> 09:35.097
I've heard enough. Turn it off.

09:35.132 --> 09:36.482
Fine.

09:36.518 --> 09:38.334
I wasn't talking to you.

09:38.370 --> 09:39.819
Please, turn <i>it</i> off.

09:39.854 --> 09:40.854
With pleasure.

09:43.166 --> 09:45.625
By the by, Penners,

09:45.660 --> 09:49.011
what, pray tell, is a house-boo?

09:49.047 --> 09:50.847
I'd rather die not knowing.

10:03.211 --> 10:05.144
Oh, hey, Darien, wait up.

10:05.179 --> 10:08.297
How you doin', Katie?

10:08.333 --> 10:10.207
Uh, actually, it's...
Katie's doin' fine.

10:10.243 --> 10:12.594
Thanks for asking.

10:12.629 --> 10:14.779
I actually have to
ask you a favor.

10:14.856 --> 10:16.497
I know that you're
the head of the dance committee,

10:16.533 --> 10:18.458
and I really wanna deejay
at tomorrow's dance.

10:18.493 --> 10:20.293
Sorry, wish I could help,
but DJ Mike's already doing it.

10:20.328 --> 10:21.368
See ya later, Katie.

10:25.850 --> 10:27.976
Okay, you don't know me.

10:28.011 --> 10:30.386
And I mean literally,
because my name is KC.

10:30.422 --> 10:34.148
But I don't really take
no for an answer, so...

10:34.183 --> 10:36.308
How about you just let me
deejay at the dance,

10:36.344 --> 10:38.136
and let's not make this weird.

10:38.171 --> 10:40.571
Uh, it's already gotten weird.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.263
What are you doing in here?

10:48.298 --> 10:49.806
Uh, blushing.

10:52.160 --> 10:53.709
What's your name?

10:53.744 --> 10:54.953
Great. Another person
at the school

10:54.988 --> 10:56.521
who doesn't know me.

11:16.443 --> 11:19.652
KC: Yeah, that's right.
What's up, everybody?

11:19.687 --> 11:24.615
Who's ready to get
their dance on with DJ KC?

11:24.651 --> 11:27.777
<i>D-D-D-D-DJ KC.</i>

11:27.812 --> 11:29.829
( scratching sound )

11:29.864 --> 11:33.232
Um, KC, what happened
to DJ Mike?

11:33.268 --> 11:35.902
He may or may not have thought
that the dance was cancelled.

11:35.979 --> 11:38.938
Why do I think that
D-D-D-DJ KC... wikka wikka...

11:38.973 --> 11:41.682
told him that?

11:41.717 --> 11:44.152
Yeah, well, Marisa, at least now,
people are gonna know who I am.

11:44.187 --> 11:46.954
All right, yeah!

11:46.989 --> 11:50.374
It's DJ KC on the ones and twos.

11:50.409 --> 11:52.677
That's DJ K to the C.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.528
That's KC.

11:54.563 --> 11:56.122
Cooper.

11:58.635 --> 12:02.437
That's K to the C
to the C to the O

12:02.472 --> 12:03.354
to the O to the P...

12:03.389 --> 12:04.797
( feedback whines )

12:07.727 --> 12:10.111
A little deejay tip.

12:10.147 --> 12:11.687
You might wanna let
the music play long enough

12:11.722 --> 12:13.072
for people to actually dance.

12:13.107 --> 12:16.142
True dat, true dat.

12:16.177 --> 12:17.334
You know what, I'm gonna
just let this playlist rock

12:17.370 --> 12:18.945
for a little bit.

12:18.980 --> 12:20.813
( Dance music plays )

12:22.992 --> 12:24.533
Hey, hey.

12:24.568 --> 12:25.868
That's right. You know.

12:25.903 --> 12:28.379
DJ KC keepin' it real.

12:28.414 --> 12:30.297
Y'all feelin' that?

12:30.333 --> 12:31.774
You feelin' that?
You feelin' that?

12:31.809 --> 12:33.809
Yeah, that's a beat
dropped on you

12:33.845 --> 12:35.953
by DJ KC. Go!

12:40.685 --> 12:43.511
Yeah, DJ KC's all about
those BPM's.

12:43.546 --> 12:45.330
That's beats per minute,

12:45.365 --> 12:47.285
according to
Wiki-wiki-Wikipedia.

12:50.052 --> 12:52.103
All right, everybody.

12:52.138 --> 12:53.955
Let's make some noise!

12:53.990 --> 12:55.390
Okay, when I say DJ,
y'all say KC.

12:55.425 --> 12:57.325
DJ.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.860
( Booing )

12:59.895 --> 13:02.397
Close. Very close.

13:02.432 --> 13:04.532
One more time.

13:04.567 --> 13:06.834
When I say DJ, you say KC. DJ!

13:06.869 --> 13:08.169
( Booing )

13:08.204 --> 13:11.005
You stink.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.199
Not quite.

13:13.235 --> 13:14.750
( Nervous chuckle ) All right.

13:14.785 --> 13:16.894
When I say DJ, you say KC. DJ!

13:16.930 --> 13:19.047
( Booing loudly )

13:19.082 --> 13:20.206
I liked you better
when you were dead.

13:20.241 --> 13:21.407
Okay!

13:21.442 --> 13:23.742
Okay.

13:23.778 --> 13:27.138
Now we're gettin' it, right?
One more time.

13:27.173 --> 13:31.242
When I say DJ, you say KC. DJ!

13:31.277 --> 13:33.157
- Get her outta here.
- DJ KC out!

13:35.623 --> 13:37.056
Should've worn the dress.

13:40.178 --> 13:41.610
Agent Graham, Agent Penelope,

13:41.645 --> 13:43.454
you have to see this.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.965
Judy, what did we tell you?

13:46.000 --> 13:47.683
We don't watch television
in this house.

13:47.718 --> 13:49.243
Then why do you have one?

13:49.279 --> 13:52.038
Good point.

13:52.115 --> 13:53.739
Put it in the rubbish,
Graham, and why don't you take

13:53.775 --> 13:54.999
you know what with it?

13:55.034 --> 13:58.452
Why don't you take it
down a notch, Snooty Blume?

14:00.831 --> 14:02.940
I just saw breaking news

14:02.975 --> 14:04.683
that the Jackal
escaped from prison,

14:04.719 --> 14:06.169
and is heading towards D.C.

14:06.204 --> 14:08.671
And we care why?

14:08.706 --> 14:10.798
The Coopers are the ones
that put him away.

14:10.833 --> 14:12.675
I've been programmed
not to contact them,

14:12.711 --> 14:14.109
but someone has to warn them.

14:14.145 --> 14:16.370
Why didn't someone warn us

14:16.405 --> 14:18.423
that she won't shut
up about the Coopers?

14:18.458 --> 14:19.915
They are no longer your concern.

14:19.951 --> 14:21.417
Graham, reset her.

14:21.453 --> 14:23.952
Don't even try it.

14:23.988 --> 14:26.556
I can take you down
with two thumbs.

14:26.591 --> 14:28.649
And I can take you down
with one.

14:30.761 --> 14:32.820
I win!

14:37.227 --> 14:39.852
Hey, did you guys notice
the car in front of our house?

14:39.887 --> 14:41.971
There's a couple of guys
just sitting out there.

14:42.007 --> 14:46.709
Yeah, it's probably some fans
of D-D-D-DJ KC!

14:46.744 --> 14:48.377
D-d-d-doubtful.

14:50.423 --> 14:52.064
They look really shady.

14:52.100 --> 14:53.273
They could be enemy agents.

14:53.309 --> 14:55.175
Bro, we're not spies anymore,

14:55.211 --> 14:57.011
so it's time to build a bridge

14:57.046 --> 14:58.446
and get over it.

14:58.481 --> 14:59.731
Your sister's right.

14:59.766 --> 15:02.850
You need to stop thinking
everything's suspicious.

15:02.885 --> 15:04.652
You also have to stop looking
out the window with binoculars.

15:04.687 --> 15:06.020
You gonna get arrested.

15:08.350 --> 15:10.291
Look, bro... ( clears throat )

15:10.326 --> 15:11.726
I understand, okay.

15:11.761 --> 15:13.577
It took me a while to transition

15:13.613 --> 15:18.365
from being a teenage spy to a regular
high school girl/superstar deejay.

15:18.400 --> 15:21.085
Who are you kidding?
You were a disaster.

15:21.120 --> 15:23.504
( Scoffs ) A disaster.

15:23.581 --> 15:25.173
People loved me. You heard
them screaming my name.

15:25.249 --> 15:28.209
Oh, I didn't know
your name was "Boo, you stink."

15:28.244 --> 15:29.944
Dad!

15:29.979 --> 15:31.337
Would you two please
stop arguing?

15:31.372 --> 15:33.430
Ow!

15:33.466 --> 15:34.882
What the...

15:42.083 --> 15:45.259
Look, guys, my deejay career
has just begun.

15:45.295 --> 15:47.615
I'm still waiting to hear back
about that bat mitz...

16:03.688 --> 16:05.528
Yeah, that's right.
Still got it.

16:09.401 --> 16:10.401
Oh, no.

16:20.688 --> 16:23.873
- Everybody okay?
- Yeah.

16:23.908 --> 16:25.174
I'm a little groggy,
but I'm good.

16:25.209 --> 16:26.984
Ernie?

16:27.019 --> 16:28.744
Ten more minutes, Mom.

16:28.780 --> 16:30.872
I wore my clothes
to bed last night

16:30.907 --> 16:32.273
so I could sleep in.

16:32.308 --> 16:33.858
It's pajamas.

16:33.893 --> 16:35.717
It's a backpack.

16:35.753 --> 16:37.028
It's a pajampack.

16:41.250 --> 16:42.367
How long have I been talking?

16:42.402 --> 16:43.759
Fourteen years.

16:43.794 --> 16:47.021
Fourteen long years.

16:47.056 --> 16:49.423
I wish I knew
who was behind this.

16:49.458 --> 16:51.217
Anyone got any ideas?

16:51.252 --> 16:53.194
The last thing I remember
is passing out

16:53.229 --> 16:54.295
and waking up
in this white room.

16:54.330 --> 16:55.863
( Gasps loudly )

16:55.899 --> 16:58.390
We're in heaven?!

16:58.426 --> 17:01.168
Yes, Ernie,

17:01.204 --> 17:02.770
because being stuck in
a room with you for all eternity

17:02.805 --> 17:03.929
is my idea of heaven.

17:08.911 --> 17:11.187
Hello, Coopers. Follow me.

17:13.023 --> 17:15.900
Agent Johnson is God?!

17:17.828 --> 17:19.328
We're not in heaven.

17:19.363 --> 17:20.655
Then that means we're...

17:20.690 --> 17:23.324
We're not dead.

17:26.321 --> 17:28.463
This better work, Graham.

17:28.539 --> 17:29.880
I'm sick and tired
of hearing about the Coopers.

17:29.915 --> 17:31.765
Don't worry, my love.

17:31.801 --> 17:34.161
This robot reboot
should do the trick.

17:38.558 --> 17:42.434
Greetings and salutations.
I'm Judy.

17:42.469 --> 17:43.619
How may I assist you?

17:43.655 --> 17:46.047
Capital job, Graham.

17:46.082 --> 17:47.681
Welcome to our home,
little robot.

17:50.019 --> 17:52.277
R2-D2 is a robot, honey.

17:52.313 --> 17:54.021
I'm a JUDY.

17:54.057 --> 17:56.740
Junior undercover digital youth.

17:56.775 --> 17:58.351
And do yourself a favor.

17:58.386 --> 18:00.346
Don't get all up
in my grill again.

18:02.348 --> 18:04.064
Now, have either of you
contacted the Coopers

18:04.099 --> 18:06.008
about the Jackal?

18:06.044 --> 18:08.119
Or a decorator
about this apartment?

18:13.426 --> 18:14.917
Forgive the dramatics,
but I thought it was time

18:14.952 --> 18:16.969
for us to talk.

18:17.004 --> 18:19.347
Oh, so you decided
to shoot us with darts.

18:19.423 --> 18:21.398
How about the next time,
you just shoot us an email?

18:21.434 --> 18:23.717
We had a training
session scheduled,

18:23.753 --> 18:25.519
so two birds, one stone.

18:25.555 --> 18:27.505
By the way,

18:27.540 --> 18:29.014
those darts are in clinic trial,

18:29.049 --> 18:31.700
so if you experience
any bowel irritation

18:31.736 --> 18:34.628
or hair loss, let us know.

18:34.663 --> 18:36.055
Okay, start talking,
Agent Johnson.

18:36.090 --> 18:37.330
What's going on?

18:40.836 --> 18:42.744
The Jackal has escaped
from prison.

18:42.780 --> 18:44.680
The Jackal.

18:44.716 --> 18:46.457
This is not good.

18:46.492 --> 18:48.926
Not good? It's awful.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.218
Catching the Jackal was one of
the most dangerous missions

18:50.254 --> 18:51.670
we've ever had.
We're lucky we survived.

18:51.705 --> 18:53.814
That man is a lunatic.

18:53.849 --> 18:55.329
I heard his request for
his final meal

18:55.359 --> 18:56.479
was his prison guard Ted.

18:58.062 --> 19:00.746
I knew he'd escape.

19:00.781 --> 19:01.863
You should've put him in something
that was impossible to get out of,

19:01.899 --> 19:03.583
like a group text.

19:03.618 --> 19:05.301
So is that why
you brought us in,

19:05.336 --> 19:07.036
to keep us safe?

19:07.071 --> 19:09.447
If by safe, you mean
use you as bait,

19:09.482 --> 19:11.941
then yes.

19:11.976 --> 19:12.925
The Jackal wants to get
to your family.

19:12.961 --> 19:16.879
The plan is, use all of you
to lure him into the open,

19:16.914 --> 19:17.897
and that's where
we'll recapture him.

19:17.932 --> 19:19.849
Are you crazy?

19:19.884 --> 19:21.075
That's a suicide mission.

19:21.110 --> 19:23.660
We realize that, so in return,

19:23.696 --> 19:26.914
we're willing to let the family
back in to the Organization.

19:26.949 --> 19:28.908
You know, assuming you survive.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.879
- We'll do it.
- Absolutely not.

19:32.955 --> 19:35.013
I will not allow my family
to be a part of this.

19:35.049 --> 19:36.715
So you're gonna do it alone?

19:36.750 --> 19:37.990
Craig, you are my hero.

19:39.745 --> 19:42.020
That's my dad.

19:42.056 --> 19:44.281
Craig, I have called you
a mediocre spy

19:44.316 --> 19:47.150
many times behind your back,

19:47.186 --> 19:50.262
and a few times to your face.

19:50.297 --> 19:54.383
But this is a new you.
Color me impressed.

19:54.419 --> 19:57.144
- Hold up. This is not right.
- Thank you, Ernie.

19:57.179 --> 19:58.579
It's not right unless
we get Judy back.

19:58.614 --> 20:01.122
Excuse me?

20:01.158 --> 20:02.742
You know what? He's right.

20:02.777 --> 20:04.744
If my dad is going to
single-handedly

20:04.820 --> 20:07.128
risk his life against
this bloodthirsty maniac,

20:07.164 --> 20:09.540
- we want Judy.
- You got her.

20:09.575 --> 20:11.517
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
She's been reassigned.

20:11.552 --> 20:13.427
This sounds like it could
be a deal breaker.

20:13.463 --> 20:14.695
And even if it's not,
are we sure we wanna be

20:14.730 --> 20:17.590
back in the Organization?

20:17.667 --> 20:19.266
I thought we were all
moving on with our lives.

20:19.302 --> 20:22.386
KC, what about your
burgeoning deejay career?

20:22.421 --> 20:23.720
( Derisive laugh )
What deejay career?

20:23.756 --> 20:25.647
I was awful.

20:25.683 --> 20:27.491
Not even my Ypod would let me
pick the songs.

20:27.527 --> 20:29.594
Okay, well, Kira.

20:29.629 --> 20:31.236
What about you?

20:31.272 --> 20:32.980
It's not too late
to have another baby.

20:33.016 --> 20:35.324
Oh, please.

20:35.360 --> 20:37.401
That was the dumbest idea
anyone has ever had.

20:37.436 --> 20:40.078
Aside from the jackpack.

20:40.114 --> 20:42.998
That's not true.
It could still take off.

20:43.034 --> 20:45.567
It's a jacket, it's a backpack.

20:45.603 --> 20:47.228
It's a lawsuit
waiting to happen.

20:47.263 --> 20:49.103
Choked me out three times today.

20:51.575 --> 20:53.600
It sounds safer than
going up against the Jackal.

20:53.636 --> 20:55.502
What if I say no?

20:55.537 --> 20:57.746
Then you're not back in.

20:57.781 --> 21:00.791
And the Jackal won't stop
till he gets to your family.

21:00.826 --> 21:05.629
We're talking about a guy who
sporked his way out of prison.

21:05.664 --> 21:07.131
Dad, face it. Without
the Organization's protection,

21:07.166 --> 21:08.966
we are sporked.

21:11.320 --> 21:13.562
Fine. I'll do it.

21:13.639 --> 21:17.424
Yes! Yes, the team
is finally back together again.

21:17.460 --> 21:19.780
You know what? Judy is
gonna be so excited to see us.

21:21.038 --> 21:23.297
This should do it.

21:23.332 --> 21:25.341
I've wiped
her memory board clean.

21:25.376 --> 21:27.736
There should be no trace
of her former self.

21:36.988 --> 21:42.416
Hello. My name is 30287459-YLT.

21:42.452 --> 21:44.018
How may I be of service to you?

21:44.053 --> 21:46.503
Splendid.

21:46.538 --> 21:48.847
But from now on,
your new name is Sally.

21:48.882 --> 21:51.842
My new name is Sally.

21:51.878 --> 21:53.427
How may I be of service to you?

21:53.462 --> 21:55.812
Aren't you wondering
how the Coopers are?

21:55.848 --> 21:58.257
The Coopers?

21:58.292 --> 22:00.212
I'm not sure
who the Coopers are.

22:02.380 --> 22:05.580
Oh. According to
the Organization data files,

22:05.616 --> 22:08.442
the Coopers are a disgraced
former spy family

22:08.477 --> 22:10.694
that are no longer
of any interest to us.

22:18.862 --> 22:21.113
All right, I just got details
from the Organization

22:21.148 --> 22:23.140
about the Jackal mission.

22:23.176 --> 22:25.176
They leaked intel
that your dad is taking Judy

22:25.252 --> 22:26.868
to the carnival in Alexandria
on Thursday night.

22:26.904 --> 22:29.021
That's when the Jackal's
gonna make his move.

22:29.057 --> 22:30.330
Oh, I didn't know the
carnival was in town.

22:30.365 --> 22:34.585
Note to self: Do not eat before
getting on the tilt-a-whirl.

22:34.620 --> 22:37.188
Bro, will you pay attention?

22:37.264 --> 22:39.731
This is the most important
mission we've ever had.

22:39.767 --> 22:43.093
Correction. The most important
mission your dad's ever had.

22:43.129 --> 22:45.679
Look, Mom, I have got
to back up Dad on this mission.

22:45.714 --> 22:48.616
The man has barely moved
in months,

22:49.476 --> 22:51.459
unless you count lifting
potato chips to his face.

22:51.495 --> 22:52.961
He is not in the best shape.

22:52.996 --> 22:55.514
Whoo hoo!

22:55.549 --> 22:57.509
I just ran six miles
in 40 minutes.

23:00.446 --> 23:03.222
All right, so he's
in okay shape.

23:03.257 --> 23:05.508
Excuse me.

23:05.584 --> 23:07.824
I trained so hard,
I deserve a round of applause.

23:10.814 --> 23:12.798
Man, what was in
those potato chips?

23:14.760 --> 23:16.994
Dad, I am begging you.

23:17.029 --> 23:18.303
You have to let me
do this mission with you.

23:18.339 --> 23:20.555
Why does this sound familiar?

23:20.590 --> 23:23.659
Oh, yeah, because you
said it 200 times!

23:23.694 --> 23:25.252
Judy is coming back, and she's
gonna be working with me.

23:25.287 --> 23:28.213
The Jackal is out for blood.

23:28.248 --> 23:30.124
That's why I chose Judy.
She doesn't have any.

23:30.159 --> 23:31.283
( Knocking on door )

23:31.319 --> 23:32.776
Judy's back!

23:35.381 --> 23:39.533
( All exclaiming )

23:39.568 --> 23:40.951
Hello, Coopers.

23:40.986 --> 23:42.978
I'm Agent Sally.

23:43.013 --> 23:44.963
I'll be waiting quietly
in sleep mode

23:44.998 --> 23:46.891
until we have a mission.

23:46.926 --> 23:49.001
( Raucous laughter )

23:52.974 --> 23:55.716
Hey, Agent Sally,
you being quiet... girl, okay.

23:57.903 --> 23:59.770
It's good to have you
home, Judy.

23:59.805 --> 24:01.313
Thank you. Just one question.

24:01.349 --> 24:02.723
Who's Judy?

24:05.861 --> 24:07.786
Who's Judy?

24:07.822 --> 24:11.873
Girl, you are on fire today.

24:11.909 --> 24:14.701
No, I'm running at
my recommended temperature.

24:14.736 --> 24:16.878
Plus, in case of an emergency,

24:16.914 --> 24:18.834
I have a built-in
fire extinguisher.

24:23.754 --> 24:25.579
I don't think she's joking.

24:27.933 --> 24:29.241
Looks like she's been
reprogrammed.

24:29.276 --> 24:30.651
I think her memory's
been erased.

24:30.686 --> 24:34.221
Great. So not only do I not
have my little sister back,

24:34.256 --> 24:35.764
but now we can't depend on her.

24:35.799 --> 24:37.491
Dad, whether you like it or not,

24:37.526 --> 24:38.642
I'm gonna have to
take her place.

24:38.677 --> 24:40.285
Or Ernie could just fix her.

24:40.321 --> 24:42.571
Okay, fine. Fine.

24:42.607 --> 24:44.973
But just to be safe,
I'm gonna start training.

24:52.466 --> 24:53.924
Yeah, uh, it's a little
harder than it looks.

24:53.960 --> 24:54.960
Good on you, Dad.

24:58.914 --> 25:01.899
I think the only reason why the
Jackal even escaped out of prison

25:01.934 --> 25:03.375
is to come after
my family, right?

25:03.410 --> 25:05.711
But he's a bad, bad guy.

25:05.713 --> 25:07.504
My dad won't even let me
be a part of the mission.

25:07.539 --> 25:09.531
Can I ask a question?

25:09.567 --> 25:11.266
Whatever happened to spies
keeping secrets?

25:11.302 --> 25:13.542
Is that not a thing anymore?

25:13.570 --> 25:16.155
Okay, point taken.

25:16.190 --> 25:17.631
But I'm still really,
really worried about this.

25:17.666 --> 25:19.141
You just need to stop
thinking about it.

25:19.176 --> 25:20.176
You need a distraction.

25:20.202 --> 25:22.427
KC, hi.

25:22.462 --> 25:24.263
I was just telling
everyone in my department

25:24.298 --> 25:27.098
that you have one of the
best math brains in school.

25:27.134 --> 25:29.993
Well, I can't argue with that.

25:30.028 --> 25:32.279
Given that, I assume your
social calendar is rather free.

25:32.314 --> 25:35.190
Well, I can't argue with that.

25:37.987 --> 25:42.772
So I was hoping you could tutor
one of my struggling students.

25:42.808 --> 25:44.908
Oh, yeah, of course.
I'd be happy to help.

25:44.943 --> 25:47.478
Plus I could really
use the distraction.

25:47.513 --> 25:49.463
Hey, Mrs. G., I was
looking at my schedule...

25:49.540 --> 25:53.592
Darien, I was kind of
already talking to Mrs. G.

25:53.627 --> 25:55.493
Of course, just send them
right over,

25:55.529 --> 25:58.138
- and I will tutor away.
- Yeah, see, I was...

25:58.173 --> 26:00.206
Again, Darien, please.

26:00.242 --> 26:02.523
Okay, the world does not
revolve around you.

26:03.938 --> 26:05.637
Just have them
get in contact with me,

26:05.672 --> 26:07.281
- and I'd be happy to help.
- Thank you.

26:07.316 --> 26:09.749
Darien, contact KC.

26:09.785 --> 26:11.760
Oh. Look at that.

26:11.795 --> 26:13.645
You're the student
that needs help.

26:13.680 --> 26:16.523
( laughing )
Who didn't see that coming?

26:18.985 --> 26:20.110
So when can we meet up?

26:20.145 --> 26:22.104
Oh, yeah, yeah.

26:22.139 --> 26:23.272
Let me check my schedule.

26:23.307 --> 26:25.206
I am available for you...

26:25.242 --> 26:28.368
around never.

26:28.404 --> 26:29.803
Is it because
I'm so good-looking,

26:29.839 --> 26:31.880
you don't trust yourself
alone with me?

26:31.957 --> 26:35.533
Oh, so you have a bad grasp
on math and reality.

26:35.569 --> 26:39.171
Come on, I really need
your help to pass math.

26:39.206 --> 26:42.140
Oh, kinda like you helped me when I
was trying to deejay at the dance?

26:42.175 --> 26:43.575
Maybe I should help you.

26:43.610 --> 26:45.994
You could sit there
and study, right,

26:46.030 --> 26:48.088
and I'll stand behind you and yell
really supportive things like,

26:48.123 --> 26:50.757
"You stink. You can't add.

26:50.793 --> 26:54.578
You got 99 problems
and you can't solve one."

26:54.613 --> 26:56.388
So, uh...

26:56.423 --> 26:58.681
right after school today?

26:58.717 --> 27:00.342
Give me one good reason
why I should help you.

27:00.377 --> 27:01.201
It would be a distraction.

27:01.236 --> 27:02.361
I'll see you at 3:00.

27:06.516 --> 27:07.636
I'ma jack you up, Jackal.

27:10.871 --> 27:12.379
Craig. Craig, you've
been at it for three hours.

27:12.414 --> 27:15.340
You need to take a rest.

27:15.376 --> 27:18.296
No. If Ernie can't fix Judy, I'm
gonna have to go in all by myself.

27:19.354 --> 27:21.437
At least take a water break.

27:21.473 --> 27:24.516
No! I didn't earn that water.

27:24.518 --> 27:26.018
The Jackal isn't taking
a break, and neither am I.

27:26.053 --> 27:27.669
You wanna help?
Put in your mouth guard

27:27.704 --> 27:29.229
and let me kick you in the face.

27:29.264 --> 27:31.181
Sit your butt down right now!

27:34.712 --> 27:36.953
Okay, honey, it's me.
Now what's going on?

27:36.989 --> 27:39.489
- Nothing.
- Craig! - Fine.

27:39.525 --> 27:42.718
I'm afraid.

27:42.753 --> 27:44.828
That we won't get
back in the Organization?

27:44.905 --> 27:46.421
No, that I won't make it
back from this mission.

27:46.457 --> 27:48.656
The Jackal is a dangerous dude.

27:48.692 --> 27:51.309
I need to be there
for my family,

27:51.344 --> 27:52.864
and I can't be there
if I'm not here.

27:55.015 --> 27:57.699
Craig, I believe in you,

27:57.734 --> 27:59.676
and you're gonna be fine.

27:59.711 --> 28:01.420
You always are, baby.

28:04.524 --> 28:07.684
Thank you, baby.
I needed to hear that.

28:07.719 --> 28:09.359
Okay. Water break over.
I need to move.

28:11.023 --> 28:12.297
- ( Bones cracking )
- Ow!

28:12.332 --> 28:13.857
Can't move, can't move.

28:13.893 --> 28:15.475
Ooh, my back.

28:18.497 --> 28:20.455
Okay, so obviously, when using
matrix M, it's inverse,

28:20.491 --> 28:23.224
so matrix M to the negative one

28:23.259 --> 28:25.739
exists if and only if the determinant
of M does not equal zero.

28:26.330 --> 28:28.863
This is pre-calculus?

28:28.898 --> 28:31.018
What happens when I get to
actual calculus?

28:31.793 --> 28:33.476
Slow down.

28:33.512 --> 28:35.437
Okay, fine. Sorry.

28:35.472 --> 28:37.432
I forgot I had to go
at jock speed.

28:39.334 --> 28:44.304
( Slowly ) Obviously,

28:44.339 --> 28:45.981
when using matrix M, and the
movie with talKeanu Reeves...

28:46.016 --> 28:47.198
What are you doing?

28:47.234 --> 28:49.501
I'm tutoring you.

28:49.537 --> 28:51.920
Really? Because it feels
like you're just cracking on me.

28:51.955 --> 28:54.614
Are you saying I need a tutor
to tutor me at tutoring you?

28:54.650 --> 28:55.924
KC, I really need
to pass this test,

28:55.959 --> 28:57.251
or I can't play in the big game.

28:57.286 --> 28:59.886
I'm sure the school is not
gonna bench their star player

28:59.921 --> 29:01.646
because of one bad grade.

29:01.682 --> 29:04.107
No, they won't, but my dad will.

29:04.142 --> 29:05.392
And I promised him
I wouldn't let football

29:05.427 --> 29:07.335
interfere with my grades,

29:07.371 --> 29:09.291
and I don't wanna
disappoint my dad.

29:11.291 --> 29:13.817
Wow. Okay.

29:13.853 --> 29:17.579
All right, well, I'll take
this seriously if you do.

29:17.614 --> 29:19.789
- Let's work, and let's get you that "A."
- I'd be good with a "C."

29:19.824 --> 29:21.904
Yeah, good, 'cause
I'm no miracle worker.

29:26.865 --> 29:28.181
How's it going with Judy?

29:28.217 --> 29:31.577
Great. All I need now is some
copper wire, a soldering iron,

29:31.612 --> 29:33.920
- and a baseball bat.
- What do you need a bat for?

29:33.956 --> 29:36.473
To beat the heck out of
whoever messed her up.

29:36.508 --> 29:39.801
CRAIG: Keep working on it, Ernie.
I need Judy for the mission.

29:39.836 --> 29:41.553
With all due respect, Dad,

29:41.588 --> 29:43.508
Judy's the least
of your problems.

29:47.745 --> 29:50.771
Is there something
different in here,

29:50.806 --> 29:53.765
like new pillows
or fresh flowers?

29:53.800 --> 29:56.543
Oh, it's Dad,
hanging upside down

29:56.578 --> 29:58.278
in his "Ow, my back
went out" machine.

29:58.313 --> 30:00.414
Just relax. I'm fine.

30:00.449 --> 30:02.816
Fine? Really?

30:02.851 --> 30:05.894
You are in no position
to take on the Jackal.

30:05.929 --> 30:08.622
You're not even in a position
to drink a glass of water.

30:08.657 --> 30:10.666
I am doing
this mission with Judy.

30:10.701 --> 30:12.935
Uh-uh. That is not gonna happen.

30:13.011 --> 30:14.152
My back is better already.
Come on, flip me around.

30:14.188 --> 30:17.814
Ow! Not better. Worse, worse.

30:17.850 --> 30:19.499
( Groaning )

30:19.534 --> 30:21.551
Oh, no, I stand corrected.

30:21.587 --> 30:24.270
You definitely have this
all under control.

30:24.305 --> 30:25.697
You know what?
I'm gonna go take a walk.

30:25.732 --> 30:27.065
I need to clear my head.

30:35.408 --> 30:38.318
Hey, Agent Johnson. It's KC.

30:38.353 --> 30:41.329
We need a new plan.
I'm comin' in.

30:52.342 --> 30:53.842
Please, please, please.

30:56.196 --> 30:57.512
Ernie, is that you?

30:57.547 --> 30:59.389
Yes, it's me.

30:59.424 --> 31:01.592
You remember me?

31:01.627 --> 31:02.658
More important,
you remember you?

31:02.694 --> 31:05.262
Yes, of course. I'm Judy,

31:05.297 --> 31:06.212
and you're my big brother Ernie.

31:06.248 --> 31:07.589
( Relieved sigh )

31:07.624 --> 31:09.850
Wow. I thought for a minute

31:09.885 --> 31:11.643
that I'd never reprogram
you right.

31:11.678 --> 31:13.562
I'm sorry. Reprogram me?

31:13.597 --> 31:15.238
What does that even mean?

31:15.274 --> 31:16.797
It means you were
malfunctioning,

31:16.833 --> 31:18.050
and I needed to reprogram you.

31:18.085 --> 31:19.368
Still not following.

31:19.403 --> 31:22.079
You're a robot.

31:22.114 --> 31:23.538
I'm a robot?!

31:26.702 --> 31:29.578
( Shrieking )

31:29.613 --> 31:31.938
What have you done to me?

31:31.973 --> 31:33.507
Help! Somebody help!

31:33.542 --> 31:36.276
I'm a monster!

31:36.311 --> 31:38.319
Calm down.

31:38.355 --> 31:40.235
There's no reason
to lose our head.

31:43.343 --> 31:45.994
( Shrieking )

31:46.030 --> 31:48.190
KIRA: Ernie, is everything
all right up there?

31:48.215 --> 31:51.024
All good. You know how
sensitive electronics can be.

31:53.804 --> 31:55.946
Ouch! Right in the power strip.

32:00.727 --> 32:03.261
KC, I hate to sing
my own praises,

32:03.296 --> 32:05.789
but you look fab-oo!

32:08.501 --> 32:11.428
( KC's voice ) Wow!

32:11.505 --> 32:15.006
And everyone always told me
I look like my mother.

32:15.041 --> 32:16.908
Hey, you think maybe
you can transform me

32:16.943 --> 32:20.270
into Beyonc one day,
just for the heck of it?

32:20.305 --> 32:22.973
Honey, I am good,
but I'm not that good.

32:26.227 --> 32:28.520
Agent Nelson, I need your help.

32:28.555 --> 32:31.164
I've come up with a plan
to save the Jackal mission.

32:31.200 --> 32:33.708
I can't do it, but I'm
thinking maybe you can make

32:33.743 --> 32:35.577
another agent look...

32:35.612 --> 32:37.278
exactly like this guy.

32:39.666 --> 32:42.325
Who looks exactly like me.

32:42.360 --> 32:45.578
Hey, great minds
think alike, hey, Cooper?

32:45.614 --> 32:48.331
You're not fooling anyone, KC.

32:48.367 --> 32:50.167
KC? Why would you think I'm KC?

32:50.202 --> 32:51.951
Okay, I'm KC.

32:51.986 --> 32:54.104
You can't do this.

32:54.139 --> 32:55.638
No, Dad, you can't.

32:55.673 --> 32:57.056
I can, and I have to.

32:57.091 --> 32:59.659
Ooh, the plot thickens.

32:59.694 --> 33:03.596
It's my fault we got kicked
out of the Organization.

33:03.632 --> 33:05.665
I have to make it right.

33:05.700 --> 33:07.717
Besides, what other
option do we have?

33:07.753 --> 33:10.073
Another agent puts on
the makeup and risks their life.

33:10.147 --> 33:12.330
- Not my daughter.
- That might catch the Jackal,

33:12.366 --> 33:13.907
but it won't get us
back in the Organization.

33:13.942 --> 33:16.159
You heard Agent Johnson.
It has to be one of us there

33:16.194 --> 33:17.677
tonight at the carnival.

33:17.712 --> 33:19.571
From the mouths of babes.

33:19.606 --> 33:22.666
Right, Craig?

33:22.743 --> 33:25.452
Oh. I'm gonna have to redo
this whole thing now.

33:30.050 --> 33:32.250
Fine. You can do the mission,

33:32.285 --> 33:34.477
but I won't be very far away.
If anything goes wrong...

33:34.513 --> 33:35.378
Nothing is gonna go wrong.

33:35.413 --> 33:37.414
Good.

33:37.449 --> 33:39.399
And nothing is gonna
distract me.

33:39.434 --> 33:40.474
( Cell phone rings )

33:40.502 --> 33:42.769
Except Darien.

33:42.804 --> 33:45.038
Ugh, that boy
really is a distraction.

33:45.073 --> 33:47.407
Two dates on prom night.

33:47.442 --> 33:48.617
Lucky you.

33:48.652 --> 33:51.736
Uh, I need a minute.

33:51.771 --> 33:53.496
And I need some boom-boom tea.

33:53.531 --> 33:54.531
Don't ask.

33:57.069 --> 33:59.035
Yes, Darien.

33:59.070 --> 34:02.947
- Hey, jerk.
- Jerk?

34:02.982 --> 34:05.417
Oh, you must've dialed
the wrong number,

34:05.452 --> 34:08.003
because I know you're not
talking to me.

34:08.038 --> 34:09.103
You're supposed to be here
tutoring me.

34:09.138 --> 34:10.530
Why are you blowing me off?

34:10.565 --> 34:12.190
I'm not blowing you off.

34:12.225 --> 34:14.359
Okay, I am blowing you off.

34:14.394 --> 34:17.411
But I didn't have a choice.

34:17.447 --> 34:19.455
KC, without your help, I'm gonna
fail this test tomorrow.

34:19.491 --> 34:21.691
- <i>You don't know that.</i>
- Yes, I do.

34:21.726 --> 34:24.110
Because you let me down, I'm not
able to play in the game.

34:24.146 --> 34:25.086
So I'm letting down
the whole team.

34:25.121 --> 34:27.080
They were counting on me.

34:27.115 --> 34:30.050
Don't talk to me about
people counting on you.

34:30.085 --> 34:31.851
People count on me all the time,

34:31.886 --> 34:32.860
and not for some stupid
stuff like a game.

34:32.895 --> 34:34.779
<i>People count on me</i>

34:34.814 --> 34:37.499
for things that
actually matter like...

34:37.534 --> 34:39.059
Like what?

34:39.094 --> 34:42.311
Like you know what? Never mind.

34:42.347 --> 34:44.272
KC, I know you think
I'm just a dumb jock,

34:44.307 --> 34:46.174
but I'm smart enough
to know that

34:46.210 --> 34:47.500
when you say you're gonna
show up for someone,

34:47.536 --> 34:49.386
you show up.

34:49.421 --> 34:50.745
( Frustrated grunt )

34:53.392 --> 34:56.076
Trouble in paradise?

34:56.111 --> 34:57.585
Just put my face back on.

35:12.636 --> 35:15.136
( KC's voice ) I'm in.

35:15.172 --> 35:17.555
CRAIG: <i>Okay, KC, stay calm.
The place is crawling</i>

35:17.591 --> 35:19.872
with undercover agents
who are there to protect you.

35:27.917 --> 35:30.009
Yep, I spotted 'em.

35:30.045 --> 35:31.677
The only thing I haven't
spotted so far

35:31.713 --> 35:33.521
is the Jackal,
unless you wanna count

35:33.556 --> 35:36.824
that thing that
balloon guy just made.

35:36.860 --> 35:41.079
Although that could've been
an oddly shaped poodle.

35:41.114 --> 35:43.323
- Are we sure the Jackal's actually gonna show up?
- <i>Yes.</i>

35:43.358 --> 35:46.250
According to intel, he will
definitely be there tonight

35:46.286 --> 35:48.570
seeking his revenge,
so stay on high alert.

35:48.605 --> 35:49.605
Copy that.

35:58.073 --> 36:00.123
I'm gonna need
a better vantage point

36:00.159 --> 36:02.976
if I wanna find the Jackal
before he finds me.

36:03.011 --> 36:04.931
Or should I say you?
( chuckles )

36:07.657 --> 36:09.417
And I think I just found it.

36:18.768 --> 36:20.643
Why does she get to
go on the Ferris wheel,

36:20.679 --> 36:21.777
and I'm stuck
fixing a broken robot?

36:21.813 --> 36:23.555
Nobody better make

36:23.590 --> 36:25.590
a "you gotta be this tall
to ride" joke.

36:30.222 --> 36:31.462
There he is!

36:33.800 --> 36:35.058
Freeze, Jackal!

36:55.797 --> 36:57.372
( People screaming )

36:58.767 --> 37:00.007
Oh, KC, watch out!

37:03.655 --> 37:06.556
I'm comin' for you,
Craig Cooper!

37:06.591 --> 37:08.351
And there's nowhere to hide!

37:14.649 --> 37:16.091
I knew this was a bad idea.

37:16.126 --> 37:17.442
KC's vulnerable;
She needs back-up.

37:17.477 --> 37:19.018
You're right. I'm going in.

37:19.053 --> 37:20.536
No, Kira, I will not
put you in danger, too.

37:20.572 --> 37:22.964
You're hurt. You can't do it.

37:22.999 --> 37:23.898
Who else is gonna
save her? Ernie?

37:23.933 --> 37:27.927
I'm right here.

37:27.962 --> 37:30.780
It's bad enough when Dad
does it, but you, too, Mom?

37:30.815 --> 37:32.874
I'm sorry, honey. It's just that
I'm under a lot of pressure.

37:32.909 --> 37:35.351
Craig, it should be me.

37:35.386 --> 37:37.921
You're right. I don't know
what I was thinking.

37:37.956 --> 37:39.236
Come on, give me a hug for luck.

37:40.566 --> 37:43.142
Craig!

37:43.178 --> 37:44.327
Sorry, honey.
Gotta do what I gotta do.

37:44.362 --> 37:45.703
Ow. Ow!

37:45.738 --> 37:47.422
Ow, ow!

37:50.343 --> 37:51.918
Well, don't just sit there, boy.

37:51.953 --> 37:53.177
Get me out of these cuffs.

38:12.340 --> 38:14.415
There's no way
out of this, Craig.

38:14.450 --> 38:17.285
And you're no match for me.

38:19.631 --> 38:21.998
The years have really
taken their toll on you.

38:23.659 --> 38:27.420
That's right. I'm not as young
as I used to be, Jackal.

38:36.848 --> 38:38.456
I'm younger.

38:38.492 --> 38:40.074
Well, well, well.

38:40.109 --> 38:42.518
KC Cooper.

38:42.553 --> 38:45.696
I guess your father
wasn't brave enough to show up.

38:45.731 --> 38:48.725
No, he's brave enough.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.360
He's just having
some lumbar issues

38:50.395 --> 38:52.729
on his L5 S1.

38:52.764 --> 38:55.073
But that's
none of your business.

39:25.772 --> 39:26.913
KC, hold on!

39:26.948 --> 39:29.315
( Jackal laughing )

39:46.000 --> 39:48.709
Look at that, Jackal.

39:48.744 --> 39:50.478
Looks like the shoe's
on the other foot.

39:50.513 --> 39:51.629
Speaking of which...

39:54.167 --> 39:57.552
If I go down, you go with me.

40:02.942 --> 40:05.643
Come on, Ernie, KC needs me.

40:05.678 --> 40:07.638
At least try to get
these cuffs off me.

40:09.323 --> 40:11.349
- Come on, Judy, be Judy.
- Ernie, will you give it up?

40:11.384 --> 40:13.559
You tried everything to fix her.

40:13.595 --> 40:15.315
- Nothing is working.
- ( frustrated groan )

40:15.530 --> 40:18.114
Ow! My hand!

40:18.149 --> 40:21.442
Forget your hand. What
about your breath, bro?

40:21.477 --> 40:24.687
Judy! I did it!
You're you again.

40:24.722 --> 40:27.540
Who do you think you are,
smackin' me upside the head?

40:27.575 --> 40:29.815
You're lucky I don't
smack you right out this van.

40:31.029 --> 40:32.989
Uh-oh. You're you again.

40:43.149 --> 40:44.599
Dad! Help!

40:48.496 --> 40:50.176
I can't get a shot, baby.

40:54.236 --> 40:55.068
BOTH: Yes!!

40:55.103 --> 40:56.103
Yes.

40:59.441 --> 41:01.121
It's okay. I got you.

41:11.310 --> 41:13.586
Ooh. That cotton candy
did not break his fall.

41:16.082 --> 41:18.716
Judy, I am so glad to see you.

41:18.752 --> 41:22.095
Yeah, I don't blame you.

41:22.130 --> 41:24.021
Whoo hoo hoo!

41:24.056 --> 41:25.616
( Back cracks ) Ow.

41:33.283 --> 41:35.900
Hey, uh, is that seat taken?

41:35.935 --> 41:37.610
Yes.

41:41.841 --> 41:44.417
( Clears throat )

41:44.452 --> 41:45.692
Oh, thank you so much.

41:48.189 --> 41:50.506
- What do you want?
- I want what you want.

41:50.541 --> 41:52.383
Okay? I want what
the entire school wants.

41:52.418 --> 41:53.917
I want you to play in the game.

41:53.953 --> 41:55.995
Okay, I may stink at math,

41:56.030 --> 41:58.723
but I know me minus
a flaky tutor,

41:58.758 --> 42:02.226
plus a failing grade
equals zero football.

42:02.261 --> 42:04.604
Okay, okay, I deserve that.

42:04.639 --> 42:06.964
Unless I don't,
because you didn't fail.

42:06.999 --> 42:09.133
What are you talking about?

42:09.168 --> 42:11.644
I just talked to Mrs. Gutierrez.

42:11.679 --> 42:14.046
It turns out you got
a "B" on your test.

42:14.081 --> 42:15.698
You passed all on your own.

42:15.734 --> 42:18.125
I did? Really?

42:18.160 --> 42:20.720
I got a "B"?

42:20.755 --> 42:22.546
I guess you did teach me
something in that first session.

42:22.582 --> 42:25.024
You know, either that or
I'm actually one of those

42:25.059 --> 42:26.943
late-in-life math geniuses.

42:26.978 --> 42:29.837
Yeah, that's not a thing.

42:29.873 --> 42:34.466
But if that is your way of
thanking me, then you are welcome.

42:34.502 --> 42:36.468
And if that's your way of saying
you're sorry, then I accept.

42:36.504 --> 42:38.429
I am sorry.

42:38.464 --> 42:39.930
And I am thanking you.

42:39.965 --> 42:42.224
Yo, guys. I got a "B."

42:42.260 --> 42:44.677
( cheering )

42:44.712 --> 42:46.387
Thank you, KC.

42:46.422 --> 42:49.315
KC, KC, KC, KC!

42:49.350 --> 42:51.425
Would you look at that?

42:51.461 --> 42:53.261
People at this school
really do know who I am.

42:57.425 --> 43:00.660
Guys, guys. Guess what.

43:00.695 --> 43:02.912
I just got word
we have been officially

43:02.947 --> 43:05.164
reinstated back into
the Organization.

43:05.199 --> 43:06.919
The Coopers are back, baby!

43:09.337 --> 43:11.328
It's good to be a spy again.

43:11.363 --> 43:13.255
Well, technically,
I never got kicked out,

43:13.290 --> 43:15.408
but yay for you humans.

43:15.443 --> 43:17.460
( Bracelet alarm chirps )

43:17.495 --> 43:19.336
Look at that.

43:19.372 --> 43:21.396
We just got our first mission.

43:21.432 --> 43:22.940
We're going to Costa Rica.

43:22.975 --> 43:25.952
Right now?

43:25.987 --> 43:27.687
But it's an all-new
<i>Cupcake Battle</i> I wanna watch.

43:27.722 --> 43:29.562
It's sprinkles versus swirls.

43:30.425 --> 43:31.807
And I'm tired.

43:31.843 --> 43:33.734
Plus Costa Rica is humid.

43:33.769 --> 43:35.728
I just got my hair done.

43:35.763 --> 43:38.597
Fine. I'll just do
the mission by myself.

43:38.633 --> 43:40.841
- ERNIE: Sounds good.
- KIRA: Works for me.

43:40.876 --> 43:42.485
- JUDY: Bring me souvenirs.
- CRAIG: See ya.

43:42.520 --> 43:43.644
Okay. All right.

43:43.679 --> 43:45.338
Well, here I do.

43:45.373 --> 43:48.191
On my own.

43:48.226 --> 43:49.784
Get your rear ends
off the couch,

43:49.819 --> 43:51.619
and let's go!

43:55.750 --> 43:57.508
The Coopers are back, baby.

43:57.543 --> 43:58.709
The Coopers are back.

44:01.873 --> 44:05.766
<i>Rob, your name's on TV.</i>
