destroy you!

09:41.381 --> 09:42.881
Hang on to your turkeys,

09:42.883 --> 09:45.884
because I'm about to make
the toughest flapjack ever.

09:45.886 --> 09:47.686
Some purple chicken milk...

09:47.688 --> 09:49.120
dramatic cornmeal...

09:49.122 --> 09:50.255

10:06.106 --> 10:08.907
Hey, Ice Queen,
I really liked your story.

10:08.909 --> 10:10.208
The imagery was tight.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.744
Can you bElieve
it was my first draft?!

10:12.746 --> 10:14.679
No way!

The...purple thing
had a <i>tablespoon</i> of syrup.

10:50.684 --> 10:54.586

a <i>tabley</i> thing, too, probably.

10:54.588 --> 10:55.787
