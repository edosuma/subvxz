09:51.171 --> 09:52.637
Just... Right? I deserve this.

09:52.662 --> 09:54.461
That's what's happening. I deserve this.

09:54.486 --> 09:55.652
- Get in the car.
- What?

09:55.677 --> 09:57.176
Get in the car. Look, I got...

09:57.201 --> 09:58.755
I have a picture of the
truck that towed your car.

09:58.780 --> 10:00.279
So, if you get in the car...

10:00.315 --> 10:01.614
- Yeah, can I...
- Hey, listen.

10:01.650 --> 10:03.397
Your freak-out's ruining my stakeout,

10:03.422 --> 10:05.033
- so just get in the car...
- Stakeout?

10:05.058 --> 10:06.496
[Laughing] What, are you a cop?

10:06.521 --> 10:07.787
Do I look like a cop?

10:07.822 --> 10:08.921
- No.
- Get in the car.

10:08.957 --> 10:10.523
- I'm not...
- Get in the car.

10:10.558 --> 10:12.247
- Get in the car!
- All right, I'm getting in!

10:12.272 --> 10:13.500
Crazy woman.

10:16.531 --> 10:18.531
[Sighs]

10:19.493 --> 10:22.459
Tissues. Beignets on the dash.

10:23.144 --> 10:25.808
What are these... are these
beignets from bottega Louie?

10:25.833 --> 10:29.535
Geez. Okay. This is a
seriously catered stakeout.

10:29.570 --> 10:32.322
- Who are you watching?
- My husband. My husband.

10:32.347 --> 10:35.218
My lying, cheating, eurotrash-screwing...

10:35.243 --> 10:37.910
- Okay.
- Pig bastard of a husband.

10:37.945 --> 10:39.345
His mistress lives there.

10:40.141 --> 10:41.687
I think.

10:42.116 --> 10:43.573
Look...

10:44.727 --> 10:48.035
Did you happen to see him when
you were walking past the lobby?

10:50.059 --> 10:52.234
Oh. You mean that guy?

10:55.830 --> 10:57.329
[Gasps] That's him.

10:57.365 --> 11:00.444
He's alone. He's alone. He's alone.

11:00.469 --> 11:03.124
Where's your slut?
Where's your slut, daddy?

11:03.149 --> 11:05.282
Come on, little slut, where are you?

11:05.317 --> 11:07.051
Oh, yeah, the slut's probably showering...

11:07.086 --> 11:09.045
- Post-sex rinse.
- Where is she?

11:11.414 --> 11:13.258
Sorry, yeah. Sorry.

11:17.266 --> 11:19.854
Do you want me to take you
to the tow yard or what?

11:20.175 --> 11:21.608
'Kay.

11:21.633 --> 11:23.700
[Indistinct talking in distance]

11:29.800 --> 11:31.400
Oh, who hung this here?

11:31.583 --> 11:33.448
Uh, I did, chef.

11:33.473 --> 11:35.139
Thought it might inspire you.

11:35.253 --> 11:36.586
Thanks, mate.

11:36.621 --> 11:38.221
[Crying]

11:38.256 --> 11:40.190
You okay?

11:40.225 --> 11:42.358
I just wanted to say what an honor...

11:42.427 --> 11:43.793
It was working with you, chef.

11:43.829 --> 11:45.845
[Chuckles] Laurie, what...

11:45.870 --> 11:48.498
- What's going on?
- Ellis just fired me.

11:49.633 --> 11:52.268
Me, Ava, Rico, Marco, all of us... gone.

11:52.304 --> 11:53.970
Okay, just... [Clears throat]

11:54.005 --> 11:56.873
Do not go anywhere.

11:56.908 --> 12:00.677
[Indistinct conversations]

12:06.222 --> 12:08.119
- What the...
- I need to see you outside.

12:08.144 --> 12:09.243
This is not the time.

12:09.279 --> 12:11.079
Yeah, it's the time. Let's go.

12:11.114 --> 12:13.173
Can you not see that I'm in a meeting here?

12:13.262 --> 12:15.922
[Clears throat] S... hey. I'm Harry.

12:16.126 --> 12:17.892
- Niko.
- Nice to meet you, Niko.

12:17.928 --> 12:19.394
Listen, I hate to interrupt your interview,

12:19.429 --> 12:20.695
but would you mind
stepping out so Ellis and I

12:20.731 --> 12:22.132
can talk about the menu real quick?

12:22.157 --> 12:23.824
- No problem.
- Thank you.

12:26.470 --> 12:28.412
I don't know who the
hell you think you are...

12:28.437 --> 12:29.925
You don't want to start with me like that.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.716
But you can't just strut in
here and fire all my staff

12:31.741 --> 12:33.560
because they're... let me guess,
what, they're not hot enough?

12:33.753 --> 12:35.486
- [Laughs]
- W... h-hey, it's not funny.

12:35.511 --> 12:37.177
Those people helped launch this place.

12:37.212 --> 12:39.462
The launch, my friend, is over.

12:39.487 --> 12:41.287
It's an event that has come and gone.

12:41.312 --> 12:43.234
I'm in charge of the nitty-gritty,

12:43.259 --> 12:44.888
and I want more pretty-pretty.

12:44.913 --> 12:47.110
Who are you? Really, you
talk like this in life?

12:47.135 --> 12:48.267
In fact,

12:48.292 --> 12:50.325
the only chick worth keeping

12:50.350 --> 12:53.251
was that party planner who quit.

12:53.276 --> 12:54.808
Just a sec, love.

12:54.833 --> 12:56.366
Now, what was her name again?

12:56.391 --> 12:58.557
It's, uh, Joss.

12:59.817 --> 13:03.951
Ooh, now, that was a ripe piece of ass.

13:03.976 --> 13:05.492
Hmm?

13:05.914 --> 13:07.873
Greta, darling.

13:08.150 --> 13:10.117
No, no, no, no. It's a fine time.

13:10.142 --> 13:12.442
No, my meeting was just
on his way out the door.

13:19.988 --> 13:22.255
- You're Karen Kim, yes?
- Yes.

13:22.290 --> 13:24.757
And this is in preparation
for the stem-cell retrieval

13:24.792 --> 13:26.435
- for Vivian Adams?
- That's correct.

13:26.460 --> 13:28.963
The drug in the injection
you're about to receive

13:28.988 --> 13:30.888
will stimulate the release of stem cells

13:30.924 --> 13:33.558
into your bloodstream to make
the retrieval process easier.

13:33.583 --> 13:35.717
You'll have one of these shots
a day for the next five days.

13:35.742 --> 13:37.071
Yes, I know. Thank you.

13:37.096 --> 13:38.963
Have your address and insurance changed?

13:38.998 --> 13:39.992
No.

13:40.017 --> 13:41.417
Your emergency contact is down here

13:41.442 --> 13:43.533
as Savannah Davis... Is that correct?

13:48.107 --> 13:50.858
Hey, thanks for sitting
for Scotty this morning.

13:50.883 --> 13:53.583
It really gave me a chance to
help Marc out with some things.

13:53.619 --> 13:56.186
Now, there is a guy who can
use all the help he can get.

13:56.221 --> 13:58.288
I think Uncle Marc's cool.

13:58.323 --> 13:59.790
"Uncle Marc"?

14:00.481 --> 14:02.614
Yeah, he's not technically your...

14:03.362 --> 14:04.961
Fine.

14:04.997 --> 14:06.763
I don't see why you
have a problem with him.

14:06.799 --> 14:10.682
No, I don't. I like him.
He's cool Uncle Marc.

14:13.603 --> 14:17.871
Anyway, since you did, in fact, babysit,

14:17.903 --> 14:22.373
I feel it's only right
if I... if I pay you.

14:22.408 --> 14:25.342
Pay me? He's my brother.

14:25.378 --> 14:26.944
What's wrong with you?

14:26.979 --> 14:28.133
Luc...

14:28.951 --> 14:30.884
[Sighs]

14:31.217 --> 14:32.816
So, how long you been married?

14:32.852 --> 14:36.012
[Sighs] Almost 10 years.

14:36.037 --> 14:38.833
Mm. [Scoffs] When did he start cheating?

14:38.858 --> 14:40.491
Doesn't matter.

14:40.526 --> 14:42.775
Oh, no. S-sorry.

14:42.800 --> 14:45.014
[Cellphone beeps] Oh, make a right here.

14:47.466 --> 14:49.033
You know, can I...

14:50.029 --> 14:52.521
- No, forget it.
- Go.

14:52.546 --> 14:54.038
Why do you stay?

14:54.206 --> 14:55.614
Money.

14:55.878 --> 14:58.708
Ah. Eh, not his money...

14:58.733 --> 15:01.611
My money. My money.

15:01.636 --> 15:03.371
- Oh. Well, then...
- If I don't have proof

15:03.371 --> 15:05.005
of his horny little habits,

15:05.030 --> 15:07.717
then I'm gonna have to pay
him half of my net worth.

15:07.742 --> 15:11.110
And that is not happening.
It is not happening.

15:11.145 --> 15:14.813
Not after the 20 years I've
spent building my brand.

15:14.849 --> 15:17.093
- Your brand?
- Yeah.

15:19.064 --> 15:21.242
Stop the train. You are not...

15:21.879 --> 15:24.822
[Gasps] Yes, you are!

15:24.847 --> 15:26.213
Calista Raines?!

15:26.249 --> 15:27.713
If you tweet this, I'll kill you.

15:27.738 --> 15:29.904
Oh, my God! I knew I recognized you!

15:29.929 --> 15:32.516
I... Calista frickin' Raines.

15:32.541 --> 15:33.974
Do you know that you are, like,

15:33.999 --> 15:35.965
one of my favorite designers of all time?

15:35.990 --> 15:37.990
I think I have four knock-offs of yours.

15:38.015 --> 15:39.877
Uh, I'm sorry.

15:39.902 --> 15:41.335
You're just... You're really expensive.

15:41.371 --> 15:43.961
What is a fashion force
like you doing driving around

15:43.986 --> 15:45.552
following your own husband?

15:45.577 --> 15:46.743
You're fabulous.

15:46.768 --> 15:48.286
W... you just hire a P.I. or something.

15:48.311 --> 15:50.244
Yeah, well, Luca sniffs them out

15:50.280 --> 15:52.726
and pays them twice as
much to back off, so...

15:52.751 --> 15:55.285
Well, you could at least cut
down on your stakeout time

15:55.310 --> 15:57.209
by doing that "find my iPhone" thing.

15:57.234 --> 15:59.234
- More.
- Are you serious right now?

15:59.259 --> 16:00.792
It's basically a tracking device.

16:00.817 --> 16:02.484
You just install it on his cellphone

16:02.509 --> 16:05.048
and you have cheater GPS...
It tells you where he is.

16:05.073 --> 16:07.466
You're a little frickin' genius!

16:07.491 --> 16:09.341
- Well, I'm a little crazy.
- You? Please.

16:09.366 --> 16:10.632
I've had nine coffees

16:10.667 --> 16:12.667
and three meals in the car today.

16:12.702 --> 16:14.302
Please, I know how this must look.

16:14.337 --> 16:16.304
No, no, believe me, I get it.

16:16.339 --> 16:18.493
Spending your life on the trail of somebody

16:18.518 --> 16:21.159
who doesn't want to be
found... Mm, I get it.

16:21.177 --> 16:22.494
Mm.

16:23.580 --> 16:26.681
I fell in love with
my sister's ex-husband,

16:26.716 --> 16:29.217
and, uh, two weeks ago, she
saw us kissing on the beach,

16:29.252 --> 16:31.085
disowned me, and split.

16:31.121 --> 16:33.293
So, I've been trying to
track her down ever since.

16:33.318 --> 16:36.127
Mm. I've always wanted a sister.

16:36.581 --> 16:38.454
Must be hard to lose one.

16:40.463 --> 16:44.065
Well, thank you for
saying that and only that.

16:45.835 --> 16:49.404
Okay. Looks like we're here.

16:49.439 --> 16:52.149
Oh. [Chuckles]

16:53.443 --> 16:56.544
Hey, listen, I hope that this

16:56.569 --> 16:58.703
isn't too f-forward or
anything, but it's...

16:58.738 --> 17:00.972
It's not every day that
I get ubered around by

17:01.007 --> 17:02.907
a world-famous designer whose clothes

17:02.942 --> 17:04.409
I would literally kill for.

17:04.444 --> 17:06.109
I just... I'm an event planner.

17:06.146 --> 17:07.944
That's my card. I don't know if...

17:07.981 --> 17:10.181
Well, I-I have a guy,
but I'll... I'll keep it.

17:10.215 --> 17:11.867
Cool.

17:12.352 --> 17:14.452
Buh-bye.

17:17.089 --> 17:19.357
Who's making this crap?!

17:19.392 --> 17:23.127
I-is this 'cause the fish
market was out of oysters?

17:23.163 --> 17:26.001
- No, Phil, it is not.
- [Clears throat]

17:27.329 --> 17:30.531
So, you really want to do
this in front of your people?

17:30.661 --> 17:32.507
What are we doing, Ellis?

17:33.606 --> 17:37.041
Um, uh, you know what,
guys? Let's just clear out.

17:37.077 --> 17:39.143
Okay, h-h-hop to it. Let's go.

17:41.195 --> 17:44.328
It's not your restaurant, Harry. It's mine.

17:44.353 --> 17:46.887
And it's Greta's... The
woman who hired me, yeah?

17:46.923 --> 17:48.282
Yeah, not so much.

17:48.307 --> 17:50.723
You see, ever since you stole
Scott Trosman's fiancée,

17:50.748 --> 17:53.840
he no longer wanted anything
to do with this place.

17:53.865 --> 17:55.709
So, he sold me his shares.

17:55.734 --> 17:59.102
I now own 65% of this restaurant.

17:59.127 --> 18:01.467
Yeah, I know.

18:01.506 --> 18:03.051
Thick with irony, isn't it?

18:03.076 --> 18:04.675
Anyway, back to our roles.

18:05.043 --> 18:07.056
I'm the owner. I'm out there.

18:07.081 --> 18:09.214
Like Paco the dishwasher,

18:09.239 --> 18:11.021
you work back here.

18:11.516 --> 18:14.417
You are not the face of this establishment.

18:14.452 --> 18:16.052
People do not come here to see you.

18:16.087 --> 18:18.087
They come with their
smartphones at the ready

18:18.122 --> 18:19.655
hoping beyond pathetic hope

18:19.690 --> 18:21.584
to catch a glimpse of
Greta Jager and that's it.

18:22.323 --> 18:25.447
So, from now on, know your role.

18:25.472 --> 18:27.525
Do not come barging into my office.

18:27.550 --> 18:30.867
Do not come out onto my
floor. Just cook or just quit.

18:30.892 --> 18:32.825
It's up to you.

18:37.341 --> 18:39.475
[Door closes] Joss, you home?

18:39.510 --> 18:41.043
Joss: I'm in the John.

18:57.887 --> 19:02.262
Oh, my God, you are not
gonna believe who I met today.

19:04.915 --> 19:06.688
What is it? What's that?

19:08.229 --> 19:10.389
A postcard from Savi.

19:13.484 --> 19:15.361
What does it say?

19:15.617 --> 19:18.324
Alive, well, in Italy.

19:19.697 --> 19:20.963
That's it?

19:21.698 --> 19:23.465
Yeah, that's it.

19:24.277 --> 19:25.924
Let me see it.

19:26.804 --> 19:28.504
- No.
- Give it to me.

19:28.539 --> 19:30.896
- Joss.
- Karen, let me see it.

19:32.309 --> 19:34.443
"Alive, fine, in Italy.

19:38.071 --> 19:39.671
Don't tell Joss."

19:47.087 --> 19:49.087
You want to talk about it?

19:49.112 --> 19:51.212
No. [Door closes]

19:56.625 --> 19:58.000
[Knocking on door]

19:58.448 --> 20:00.880
Okay, hold on. I'm coming.

20:02.498 --> 20:04.288
Scotty bit a kid.

20:04.313 --> 20:05.417
What?

20:05.442 --> 20:06.875
I got a call from the
school, I have an appointment

20:06.900 --> 20:08.849
with the principal later,
and he sounded pissed.

20:08.874 --> 20:10.420
I mean, apparently this
is a really big deal.

20:10.445 --> 20:11.808
- He can get suspended.
- What school?

are you gonna un-cook that?

30:38.611 --> 30:40.787
Sorry I'm late, folks. Let's do this.

30:40.812 --> 30:42.992
- What's going out, Phil?
- Uh, everything. I don't know.

30:43.017 --> 30:44.626
Okay, big breath. I've got this. I got it.

30:44.651 --> 30:46.106
Ellis was on a rampage earlier.

30:46.131 --> 30:48.065
He's out there with a table of six VIPs.

30:48.100 --> 30:49.399
If I were you, I'd steer clear.

30:49.435 --> 30:51.568

Ah.

30:56.108 --> 30:57.274
Sorry for the wait, folks.

30:57.309 --> 30:59.441
- Oh, good, good.
- Oh, finally.

30:59.466 --> 31:01.922
Thank God. I was going to fall over.

31:01.947 --> 31:05.682
I was personally making
some off-the-menu dishes.

31:05.718 --> 31:07.551
Okay, we have roast beet
salad with horseradish

31:07.586 --> 31:08.986

31:09.021 --> 31:11.338
and seared scallop with carrot olive oil

31:11.363 --> 31:13.630
and citrus tapenade. Please, enjoy.

31:13.665 --> 31:15.203
All right, we got it. Thank you.

31:18.991 --> 31:20.724
Mmm.

31:20.749 --> 31:22.276
Oh, my God.

31:23.078 --> 31:26.122
I have to say, this dish is everything.

31:26.147 --> 31:29.481
I mean, it's... it's
innovative. It's whimsical.

31:29.506 --> 31:31.005

31:31.030 --> 31:33.260
Thank you. Thank you.
You're just as descriptive

31:33.285 --> 31:35.285

31:41.827 --> 31:43.560
Oh, I think I'm falling over again.

31:43.595 --> 31:46.263
I mean, you're smart, you're
talented, and you're handsome.

31:46.298 --> 31:49.379
Seriously, Ellis, you should
make it an open kitchen.

31:49.404 --> 31:51.738
It's a shame not to be
able to watch him all night.

31:51.773 --> 31:53.306
Oh, I-I couldn't possibly work

ladies such as yourself.

the class for one more kid?

32:07.919 --> 32:09.719
O-okay. Thanks.

32:09.744 --> 32:11.874
Oh, my God! I am so sorry!

I know I was supposed to
meet you at church yesterday.

32:14.124 --> 32:15.356

32:16.451 --> 32:18.284
Honey, what is it?

32:19.922 --> 32:21.621

32:27.187 --> 32:29.754

32:31.220 --> 32:34.888
I'm afraid with her gone,
our friendship will fade.

32:34.973 --> 32:38.208
She was the glue, the
one who brought me in.

32:38.673 --> 32:40.840
And I know Joss is like your sister.

32:40.875 --> 32:43.643

You are spinning out.

32:50.184 --> 32:51.332
I can't even.

32:51.830 --> 32:56.366
Listen to me, Savi or no
Savi, you are my sister, too.

32:57.156 --> 32:58.989
I may miss things because of Lucy,

32:59.014 --> 33:01.515
but you are never falling out of anything.

33:01.550 --> 33:03.950
And our friendship better
not fade, because I need you.

33:03.986 --> 33:07.187
I need, like, six therapists right now.

33:07.222 --> 33:10.099
- What's going on?
- My daughter isn't talking to me

33:10.124 --> 33:12.896
and I seem to have adopted a third child

33:12.921 --> 33:15.588
in the form of a migrating 32-year-old man.

33:21.843 --> 33:23.376
Can I run it by you?

33:28.191 --> 33:29.857
I'm sorry.

33:29.882 --> 33:31.929
- It's fine.
- No, I'm really sorry.

33:32.161 --> 33:35.496
It's really fine. Can I
have another one of these?

33:35.521 --> 33:37.257
I really thought it was my sister.

33:37.282 --> 33:39.366
Right. Yes. Let's talk about that.

33:39.391 --> 33:40.924
Let's talk about that. So what's...

33:40.959 --> 33:42.520
What's his name, again? Harry?

33:42.545 --> 33:43.625
- Harry.
- Harry.

33:43.650 --> 33:45.116
Do you love him?

33:45.141 --> 33:48.065
- Oh, yeah.
- Well, did she?

33:48.530 --> 33:50.273
- Who?
- Your sister.

33:50.298 --> 33:51.997
Well, he was her husband.

33:52.022 --> 33:54.055
Yeah, she cheated on him, she dumped him,

33:54.080 --> 33:55.980
and she left him for dead, so to me,

33:56.005 --> 33:58.905
she sounds like she's not
worth the sturm and drang.

33:58.930 --> 34:00.399
Yeah, I don't know what that means.

34:00.424 --> 34:03.258
It means stop being so hard on yourself.

34:03.283 --> 34:06.350
So what? She caught you in
a "here to eternity" moment

34:06.375 --> 34:07.807
with her ex.

34:07.843 --> 34:10.409
While my fiancé was
waiting for me at the altar.

34:12.716 --> 34:14.538
- Okay.
- Yeah.

34:14.837 --> 34:16.831
Well, this Harry must be

34:16.856 --> 34:19.612
something pretty special, then, right?

34:19.675 --> 34:22.579
He is. He's the one.

know I have waiting for me.

34:30.458 --> 34:32.257

- How?

34:33.225 --> 34:36.536
I have an idea. Okay, I'm her.

34:36.572 --> 34:38.170
I'm your sister. Tell me.

34:38.206 --> 34:39.572
- What are you talking about?
- Tell me.

34:39.608 --> 34:41.007
Tell me what you want to say.

34:41.043 --> 34:42.409
- I'm... I'm her. Savi.
- Let me get the e-mail.

34:42.444 --> 34:44.811
- Okay, hold on.
- No, no e-mail. No e-mail.

34:44.846 --> 34:46.179
Joss, just say it. Just say it. Say it.

34:46.214 --> 34:47.746
I don't know what I'm supposed to say.

34:47.783 --> 34:48.748
"Savi." "Savi." Okay.

34:48.784 --> 34:51.351
- Um, Savi.
- Mm-hmm?

34:51.386 --> 34:53.520
I need you not to hate me.

34:53.554 --> 34:54.853
Why?

34:54.889 --> 34:57.324
Because I can't live with that.

34:57.359 --> 34:59.159
- Of course you can. Next.
- No, I can't.

34:59.194 --> 35:00.860
I can't.

35:00.896 --> 35:03.563
You can, Joss. You can.

35:03.599 --> 35:06.700
It'll be uncomfortable, it'll suck,

35:06.735 --> 35:11.338
and you'll feel loss...
But you can live with it.

Hi. Y-you're there.

I didn't think you'd actually pick up.

36:52.583 --> 36:55.317
Oh, well, then, why did you call me?

36:55.732 --> 36:58.011
To leave a soliloquy on your voice-mail.

36:58.468 --> 37:01.801
Well, then, I'll hang up
and you can call me back.

37:17.120 --> 37:19.154
Oh, it's really not worth getting into,

37:19.189 --> 37:21.456

was halfway down the road

37:21.491 --> 37:23.324
to throwing it all away...

37:23.910 --> 37:27.529
When I remembered how you fought for me,

37:27.564 --> 37:30.231
how you fought for me not
to go back to Australia,

37:30.267 --> 37:32.901
and how you fought for me
to get this rock-star job,

37:32.936 --> 37:35.826
and to keep it when things
got weird with Greta.

37:35.851 --> 37:38.434

during this little rough patch,

37:38.459 --> 37:40.593

fighting for myself, Joss,

37:40.628 --> 37:42.428

I... I did it in a way
you'd be proud of, I think.

In a way that didn't wreck
