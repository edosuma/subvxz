00:01.760 --> 00:03.205
Abraham:
So there we were,

00:03.360 --> 00:05.931
scraping our sacks
in the sandbox.

00:06.080 --> 00:08.048
Open targets in the dunes.

00:08.200 --> 00:10.646
All of us sweating
and swearing.

00:10.800 --> 00:14.043
Sure as hell beat sitting on our <i>asses</i>
30 klicks to nowhere

00:14.240 --> 00:15.446
waiting for
our humpbacked friend

00:15.600 --> 00:18.126
to defecate the keys
to our transport.

00:18.280 --> 00:21.648
- Sasha: Camels don't eat keys.
- They do, it did.

00:21.800 --> 00:24.280
And it shit it out.
( chuckles )

00:24.440 --> 00:27.171
I shit you not.

00:27.320 --> 00:28.685
You're an idiot.

00:28.880 --> 00:31.690
I've never denied it.

00:31.880 --> 00:33.370
(giggles)

00:36.600 --> 00:38.489
Brave new world.

00:40.560 --> 00:43.928
I still can't stop thinking
about Maggie having a pup.

00:44.080 --> 00:47.163
- In this.
- What about it?

00:47.320 --> 00:49.766
You know,
the way things go.

00:49.920 --> 00:51.968
The way they can.

00:53.920 --> 00:57.606
Yeah.
Maybe that's why.

00:59.120 --> 01:01.122
Because the way things go.

01:05.519 --> 01:07.284
Uh...

01:10.960 --> 01:13.327
You already
called me an idiot.

01:13.480 --> 01:15.323
Never had to.

01:15.480 --> 01:18.051
( Chuckles )
Yeah.

01:22.440 --> 01:24.602
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:24.760 --> 01:26.649
Nope.

01:26.800 --> 01:28.689
I'm, uh...

01:28.840 --> 01:31.286
starting a new shift.

01:31.480 --> 01:33.847
The watch post on Baggarly.

01:35.800 --> 01:37.529
That so?

01:37.680 --> 01:39.682
Yeah, I already talked
to Eugene.

01:39.840 --> 01:41.285
He wants to help out more.

01:41.440 --> 01:43.966
Said he'd take over
my patrol with you.

01:44.160 --> 01:46.731
Uh...

01:46.880 --> 01:48.041
how about that?

01:48.200 --> 01:50.202
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:50.360 --> 01:51.885
How about that?

01:54.520 --> 01:57.091
Um...

01:57.240 --> 01:58.765
see you around?

01:58.920 --> 02:00.365
Yeah.

02:03.840 --> 02:05.968
Yeah.

02:06.120 --> 02:08.566
See you around, Abraham.

02:20.680 --> 02:22.409
( Sighs )

02:22.560 --> 02:23.686
<i>He'! '</i>

02:26.080 --> 02:28.367
Hey, Abraham.

02:28.520 --> 02:29.726
<i>He'! '</i>

02:29.880 --> 02:32.201
You still here?

02:37.760 --> 02:40.764
You know Eugene's
gonna start patrolling?

02:40.920 --> 02:42.968
Mm-hmm.

02:43.120 --> 02:46.602
He asked me to teach him
how to fieldstrip automatics.

02:46.760 --> 02:49.161
He's gonna
teach me chemistry.

02:49.320 --> 02:51.641
Mm.

02:51.800 --> 02:53.529
You can't teach chemistry.

02:53.680 --> 02:56.365
- Really?
- Mm-mm.

02:57.920 --> 02:59.968
( Moans )

03:04.240 --> 03:07.130
Sweet flaming mercy.

03:08.800 --> 03:12.600
That was just... beyond.

03:12.760 --> 03:14.683
Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah?

03:20.520 --> 03:22.090
Mm.

03:31.520 --> 03:32.726
Catch.

03:37.680 --> 03:39.648
It's from the fuel truck.

03:39.800 --> 03:41.802
Had a cracked brake light.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.369
You made this?

03:45.520 --> 03:47.488
Thought your neck
looked a little lonely.

03:47.640 --> 03:51.281
Rosita Espinosa...

03:51.440 --> 03:54.011
you are damn near perfection,
you know that?

03:54.160 --> 03:56.322
( Chuckles )

04:00.760 --> 04:02.410
Show me.

04:08.080 --> 04:10.560
In the shower.

04:10.720 --> 04:12.324
In a minute.

04:14.320 --> 04:16.129
(water running)

04:34.440 --> 04:36.329
Glenn:
Maggie.

04:36.480 --> 04:38.244
<i>He'! '</i>

04:39.680 --> 04:42.684
We get the trellises in,
we can start going vertically.

04:42.880 --> 04:45.531
Double our yield of tomatoes
per square foot.

04:46.960 --> 04:49.406
We can only keep stretching
our rations so far.

04:54.400 --> 04:56.926
Still haven't seen a single bud.

04:58.480 --> 05:00.801
Babe.

05:00.960 --> 05:03.201
It'll grow.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.971
We're gonna be okay.

05:07.320 --> 05:09.049
( Faint click)

05:25.560 --> 05:27.449
( sighs )

05:31.960 --> 05:34.327
What the hell are you doing
in our house?

05:36.280 --> 05:38.601
I'm, uh, sitting on the steps

05:38.760 --> 05:40.922
looking at this painting,

05:41.080 --> 05:43.242
waiting for your mom and dad
to get dressed.

05:44.480 --> 05:45.925
Hi...

05:46.080 --> 05:47.286
- I'm Jesus.
- ( door opens )

05:47.440 --> 05:49.090
( footsteps approach )

05:49.280 --> 05:52.602
Carl, hey, um...

05:52.760 --> 05:56.401
- ( door closes )
- ( hammers click)

05:56.560 --> 05:59.564
It's-- it's okay.

05:59.720 --> 06:01.961
Rick:
You said we should talk.

06:02.120 --> 06:05.442
So let's talk.

06:05.600 --> 06:08.331
So, how'd you get out?

06:08.480 --> 06:10.289
One guard can't cover two exits

06:10.440 --> 06:12.647
or third floor windows.

06:12.800 --> 06:14.802
Knots untie
and locks get picked.

06:14.960 --> 06:17.406
- Entropy comes from order, right?
- Right.

06:19.240 --> 06:21.481
I checked out your arsenal.

06:21.640 --> 06:23.483
I haven't seen anything
like that in a long time.

06:23.640 --> 06:27.690
You're well-equipped,
but your provisions are low.

06:27.840 --> 06:29.888
Very low for the amount
of people you have.

06:30.040 --> 06:32.884
- 54?
- More than that.

06:35.640 --> 06:38.371
Well, I appreciate the cookie.
My compliments to the chef.

06:38.520 --> 06:40.090
Yeah, she ain't here.

06:41.280 --> 06:44.363
Look, we got off to a bad start.

06:44.520 --> 06:48.081
But we're on the same side--
the living side.

06:49.800 --> 06:52.326
You and Rick had every reason
to leave me out there,

06:52.480 --> 06:54.084
but you didn't.

06:54.240 --> 06:57.722
I'm from a place
that's a lot like this one.

06:57.880 --> 07:01.248
Part of my job is searching out
other settlements to trade with.

07:01.440 --> 07:05.286
I took your truck because
my community needs things,

07:05.480 --> 07:08.324
and both of you
looked like trouble.

07:08.480 --> 07:10.482
I was wrong.

07:10.640 --> 07:14.531
You're good people.
And this is a good place.

07:14.680 --> 07:17.206
I think our communities may be
in a position to help each other.

07:17.360 --> 07:20.489
- Do you have food?
- We've started to raise livestock.

07:20.640 --> 07:22.642
We scavenge, we grow.

07:22.800 --> 07:24.484
Everything from tomatoes
to sorghum.

07:24.640 --> 07:26.608
Tell us why we should
believe you.

07:26.760 --> 07:27.921
I'll show you.

07:28.080 --> 07:30.208
If we take a car,
I can take you back home in a day,

07:30.360 --> 07:33.603
and you can all see for yourselves
who we are and what we have to offer.

07:33.800 --> 07:37.771
Wait, you're looking
for more settlements?

07:37.920 --> 07:40.287
You mean you're already
trading with other groups?

07:44.400 --> 07:46.880
Your world's about to get
a whole lot bigger.

07:49.280 --> 07:52.045
( Theme music playing )

08:32.720 --> 08:34.085
Here.

08:34.280 --> 08:35.850
Homemade oat cake.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.287
Complex carbohydrates,
omega-3s.

08:38.440 --> 08:40.568
Nah, I'm good.

08:40.720 --> 08:44.645
We're gonna make a pit stop.
I'll pick up something then.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.802
Like rabies?

08:49.280 --> 08:51.521
Is this 'cause I tried
to get you that stuff?

08:51.680 --> 08:54.126
Yeah.

08:54.280 --> 08:56.442
And you remind me
of someone I used to know.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.445
Well...

09:01.640 --> 09:03.449
I hope it tastes better
than it looks.

09:03.640 --> 09:05.404
'Cause it looks like shit.

09:05.600 --> 09:07.967
Shit's still better than roadkill.

09:08.120 --> 09:10.646
Okay, maybe-- just eat it.

09:17.640 --> 09:18.971
You sure?

09:19.160 --> 09:21.003
No.

09:21.200 --> 09:22.690
But if he's telling the truth,

09:22.840 --> 09:25.366
this could be the start
of everything.

09:25.520 --> 09:28.330
( Speaking softly )

09:30.320 --> 09:32.971
Look, I was gonna tell you
about me and Michonne,

09:33.120 --> 09:34.804
but it just happened.

09:34.960 --> 09:37.167
It just happened.

09:37.320 --> 09:39.243
Last night.

09:44.440 --> 09:46.807
This is-- this is different.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.968
It's cool.

09:50.120 --> 09:52.361
All right.

09:52.520 --> 09:55.205
Well, get your stuff.

09:55.400 --> 09:57.687
Gabriel can take care of Judith
while we're gone.

09:57.840 --> 09:59.569
No, I'm not coming.

10:00.800 --> 10:04.566
Someone's gotta stay back,
keep this place safe.

10:04.720 --> 10:06.290
A kid with a messed-up face
probably wouldn't make

10:06.440 --> 10:08.522
the best first impression anyway.

10:21.320 --> 10:22.446
(babbfing)

10:22.640 --> 10:24.847
Let's chew up some asphalt!

10:56.560 --> 10:57.766
<i>He'! '</i>

10:59.880 --> 11:01.723
Can I ask you a question?

11:01.880 --> 11:04.201
Sure.

11:09.960 --> 11:14.807
When you were,
uh, "pouring the Bisquick,"

11:14.960 --> 11:18.407
were you trying
to "make pancakes"?

11:18.560 --> 11:22.042
Uh... yes?

11:23.800 --> 11:26.201
Oh, okay, um...

11:27.840 --> 11:30.446
it's something
that we talked about, yeah.

11:30.600 --> 11:32.284
- Yeah.
- Why?

11:32.440 --> 11:34.442
No, I just...

11:35.640 --> 11:39.770
Well, given the precarious

11:39.920 --> 11:43.288
state of affairs
on any given Sunday,

11:43.440 --> 11:46.523
I am damn near floored
that you or anyone else

11:46.720 --> 11:49.291
would have the cojones
to make a call like that.

11:49.440 --> 11:52.125
I mean, well...

11:52.280 --> 11:56.444
we're trying to build something,
me and her.

11:56.600 --> 11:58.204
All of us.

12:01.800 --> 12:03.643
For the record,

12:03.800 --> 12:06.246
I see rain coming,
I'm wearing galoshes.

12:09.560 --> 12:11.403
I double up.

12:32.800 --> 12:34.848
Yo, Rick.
What's going on?

12:35.000 --> 12:37.002
We got a crash ahead.

12:37.160 --> 12:39.128
Looks like it just happened.

12:43.080 --> 12:45.367
It's one of ours.

12:49.840 --> 12:51.808
( Walkers snarling )

13:05.840 --> 13:09.003
If this is a trick,
it won't end well for you.

13:09.160 --> 13:10.525
My people are in trouble.

13:10.720 --> 13:14.202
They don't-- we don't
have a lot of fighters.

13:14.360 --> 13:17.523
I know how it looks,
but I'll play it out.

13:17.680 --> 13:20.411
- Can I borrow a gun?
- No.

13:20.560 --> 13:22.210
We got tracks right here.

13:22.400 --> 13:24.164
( Bangs on door)

13:26.280 --> 13:28.169
Jesus:
They gotta be in there.

13:30.480 --> 13:32.244
We moving in or what?

13:32.400 --> 13:34.562
How do we know this ain't
firecrackers in a trash can?

13:34.720 --> 13:36.051
You don't.

13:36.200 --> 13:38.771
We'll get your people.

13:38.960 --> 13:41.167
You're staying here
with one of us.

13:43.080 --> 13:44.366
That's the deal.

13:44.520 --> 13:46.329
- Glenn: Will you stay?
- Maggie: Yeah.

13:46.480 --> 13:48.403
Maggie:
Y'all go. Just be careful.

13:48.560 --> 13:52.042
Yeah.
We're gonna be careful.

13:52.200 --> 13:54.567
Just hurry.

13:55.760 --> 13:58.047
You hear me whistle,
shoot him.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.089
Maggie:
I will.

14:20.040 --> 14:22.725
( Walkers snarling )

14:32.280 --> 14:34.282
( snarling continues )

14:38.600 --> 14:40.887
(grunting )

14:45.240 --> 14:47.481
Michonne: Come on out.
We're not gonna hurt you.

14:47.640 --> 14:50.564
We're friends of Jesus.
We're here to get you out.

14:50.720 --> 14:52.484
- There more of you?
- Two more. They ran ahead.

14:52.640 --> 14:54.802
( Walkers snarling )

14:59.160 --> 15:00.924
( snarling )

15:07.840 --> 15:09.842
( faint clattering )

15:13.680 --> 15:16.809
Come on. We're with Jesus.
Let's go.

15:16.960 --> 15:19.247
I can't go with you.
I'm looking for my friend.

15:19.400 --> 15:22.290
He's close, and he's hurt
from the crash.

15:23.520 --> 15:25.522
( Walkers snarling )

15:27.360 --> 15:30.523
- ( man yelling)
- ( walker snarling )

15:39.880 --> 15:42.326
No!

15:42.480 --> 15:44.528
Daryl:
Come on, man, let's go.

15:44.680 --> 15:46.125
Come on!

15:46.280 --> 15:47.645
- You got him?
- Go.

15:47.840 --> 15:49.888
Come on. Come on.

15:51.120 --> 15:52.804
( Walker growls )

15:57.720 --> 16:00.326
( rattling )

16:03.000 --> 16:05.002
Name's Harlan, by the way.

16:05.160 --> 16:07.128
Maggie.

16:09.200 --> 16:11.931
That's my husband, Glenn.

16:12.080 --> 16:13.445
Harlan:
We're bringing back medications.

16:13.600 --> 16:17.127
You may have saved more people
than just us back there, Glenn.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.209
- You're a doctor?
- Yeah, that's right.

16:22.360 --> 16:24.761
You have any prenatal
vitamins in there?

16:29.480 --> 16:32.165
<i>- For you'?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

16:32.320 --> 16:36.644
Well, uh,
I was an obstetrician before,

16:36.800 --> 16:39.041
and I most definitely owe you.

16:39.200 --> 16:42.727
So, I'd say you two
just hit the jackpot.

16:55.360 --> 16:57.362
You okay, Freddie?

17:01.760 --> 17:04.491
For a second back there,

17:04.640 --> 17:07.290
just when I thought
he was gonna...

17:09.920 --> 17:14.482
Freddie: I saw my wife.
She died before all this.

17:14.640 --> 17:17.211
(voice breaking )
Just when I thought it was over,

17:17.359 --> 17:20.682
there she was.
( chuckles )

17:20.839 --> 17:22.762
As clear as day.

17:22.920 --> 17:25.048
( Freddie sobs )

17:34.560 --> 17:36.608
( splashes )

17:36.760 --> 17:39.445
( tires whirring,
splashing )

17:44.760 --> 17:45.807
Damn it.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.480
( Motor roars )

17:48.640 --> 17:51.166
A storm must've passed through.

17:51.320 --> 17:53.129
We're stuck.

17:53.280 --> 17:56.648
No worries. We're here.

18:10.160 --> 18:14.245
That's us.
That's the Hilltop.

18:52.400 --> 18:53.925
Man:
Stop right there.

18:54.080 --> 18:55.730
- Jesus: Whoa!
- Daryl: You gonna make us?

18:55.880 --> 18:57.325
Jesus, what the hell is this?

18:57.480 --> 19:01.280
Open the gates, Cal.
Freddie's hurt.

19:01.440 --> 19:03.010
Look, sorry
about these guys.

19:03.200 --> 19:05.965
They get antsy standing up there
all day doing nothing.

19:06.160 --> 19:08.288
They give up the weapons.
Then we'll open the gates.

19:08.440 --> 19:09.646
Daryl: Why don't you
come down here and get 'em?

19:09.800 --> 19:12.451
Gentlemen, look,
we vouch for these people, all right?

19:12.600 --> 19:16.605
- They saved us out there.
- Jesus: Lower the spears.

19:16.800 --> 19:19.610
Look, I'm not taking any chances.
Tell your guy Gregory to come out here.

19:19.800 --> 19:24.044
No. Don't you see
what just happened?

19:24.200 --> 19:26.806
I'm letting you keep your guns.

19:26.960 --> 19:31.204
Look, we ran out of ammo
months ago.

19:31.360 --> 19:33.044
I like you people.

19:34.240 --> 19:36.242
I trust you.

19:37.640 --> 19:39.802
Trust us.

19:52.760 --> 19:55.206
Open the gates, Cal.

19:57.040 --> 19:59.042
( Squeaking )

20:01.240 --> 20:03.368
( cow mooing )

20:21.560 --> 20:23.562
( clucking )

20:30.880 --> 20:35.090
- Hey, thanks again.
- Come see me whenever.

20:35.240 --> 20:38.084
I'm just over here
in the medical trailer, okay?

20:54.240 --> 20:57.608
There was a materials yard
for a power company nearby.

20:57.760 --> 21:00.809
That's how we put up the walls.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.122
A lot of people came
from a FEMA camp.

21:03.320 --> 21:05.527
Trailers came with them.

21:05.680 --> 21:09.207
Michonne: How did people
find out about this place?

21:09.360 --> 21:11.840
That's called Barrington House.

21:12.040 --> 21:15.362
The family that owned it
gave it to the state in the '30s.

21:15.520 --> 21:18.729
The state turned it into
a living history museum.

21:18.920 --> 21:23.687
Every elementary school for 50 miles
used to come here for field trips.

21:23.880 --> 21:25.564
The place was running a long time
before the modern world

21:25.760 --> 21:28.240
built up around it.

21:28.400 --> 21:30.289
I think people came here
because they figured

21:30.440 --> 21:32.442
it'd keep running after
the modern world broke down.

21:34.440 --> 21:37.922
Those windows up there
let us see for miles in every direction.

21:38.080 --> 21:39.730
It's perfect for security.

21:39.880 --> 21:42.963
Come on.
I'll show you inside.

22:06.880 --> 22:09.565
Good gracious, Ignatius.

22:09.760 --> 22:13.242
Jesus: Most of the rooms
have been converted to living spaces.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.402
Even the ones
that weren't bedrooms.

22:15.600 --> 22:18.001
Rick: People live here
and the trailers?

22:18.160 --> 22:22.563
Jesus: We plan to build.
There's babies being born.

22:24.400 --> 22:26.084
Jesus.

22:26.280 --> 22:28.282
You're back.

22:29.960 --> 22:31.086
With guests.

22:31.280 --> 22:34.124
Jesus:
Everyone, this is Gregory.

22:34.280 --> 22:36.123
He keeps the trains
running on time around here.

22:36.280 --> 22:38.647
<i>I'm the boss.</i>

22:38.800 --> 22:41.121
Well, I'm Rick.
We have a community--

22:41.280 --> 22:44.124
Why don't y'all
go get cleaned up, hmm?

22:47.840 --> 22:49.569
We're fine.

22:49.760 --> 22:52.240
Jesus will show you
where you can get washed up.

22:52.400 --> 22:55.643
Then come back down here
when you're ready.

22:55.800 --> 22:59.168
It's hard to keep this place clean.

22:59.320 --> 23:02.130
Yeah. Sure.

23:04.960 --> 23:07.201
Follow me.

23:13.440 --> 23:16.171
You clean up first.
You talk to him.

23:16.320 --> 23:17.685
Why?

23:17.840 --> 23:19.649
I shouldn't.

23:19.800 --> 23:22.644
And you gotta start
doing these things.

23:47.680 --> 23:50.763
How long do you think Rick
and Michonne been ugging bumplies?

23:51.960 --> 23:53.962
I don't know.

23:55.520 --> 23:57.568
You ever think about it?

23:59.360 --> 24:01.408
Settling down?

24:03.080 --> 24:05.287
You think shit's settled?

24:24.040 --> 24:25.405
<i>GreQOW -</i>

24:25.560 --> 24:27.562
- Natalie, right?
- Maggie.

24:27.720 --> 24:29.210
That's pretty close.

24:29.400 --> 24:31.129
Not really.

24:31.320 --> 24:34.802
She calls them like she sees them.
I like that.

24:34.960 --> 24:36.962
Come in, let's chat.

24:43.400 --> 24:48.008
Yeah. I-- I came
to this place once before,

24:48.160 --> 24:49.844
when it was a museum--

24:50.000 --> 24:53.288
this, um, Chamber
of Commerce thing.

24:55.360 --> 24:58.284
Love that painting.

24:58.440 --> 25:01.649
I never figured it'd be mine,

25:01.800 --> 25:03.928
here it is.

25:04.080 --> 25:07.448
It's like it was waiting for me
the whole time.

25:10.440 --> 25:12.329
Hmm.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.083
Jesus told me
your group saved Dr. Carson.

25:21.240 --> 25:23.607
Obviously, a doctor's
a rare commodity today,

25:23.760 --> 25:25.569
so I want to thank you
for bringing ours back.

25:25.720 --> 25:27.609
My husband saved him.

25:27.760 --> 25:29.888
I'll be sure
to thank him, too.

25:30.040 --> 25:32.884
This place,
what you have here,

25:33.040 --> 25:35.566
- has been here since the start?
- That's right.

25:35.760 --> 25:39.321
And how-- how is it--
how have you survived here?

25:39.480 --> 25:43.007
You're looking at how.
I'm good at this.

25:43.160 --> 25:45.891
And I don't get hung up
on the details.

25:46.040 --> 25:48.611
Where you live, is it as nice
as the Hilltop Colony?

25:48.760 --> 25:51.445
- It's just different.
- How do you feed everyone?

25:51.600 --> 25:54.570
Jesus said you had land
for gardens, but no crops.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.165
We just started planting.

25:56.360 --> 25:58.488
- Planting what?
- Cucumbers, tomatoes.

25:58.640 --> 26:02.770
Oh, crops-- soy,
corn, hemp, sorghum.

26:02.920 --> 26:04.843
- Garden stuff.
- But you have guns,

26:05.040 --> 26:06.963
so I assume you have
a decent weapons cache.

26:07.120 --> 26:09.009
It's decent.

26:09.160 --> 26:12.004
And your infirmary,
is it stocked?

26:12.160 --> 26:14.447
Is yours?

26:14.600 --> 26:17.001
We came here hoping
to talk trade.

26:17.160 --> 26:20.243
Do you have enough here
for that?

26:20.400 --> 26:23.643
You see what I have here.
You see what I've built.

26:25.160 --> 26:30.087
Jesus said that your food situation
was challenged right now.

26:31.800 --> 26:35.930
You don't keep people fed,
it comes apart.

26:36.080 --> 26:39.289
Let's speak the common tongue
here, huh?

26:39.440 --> 26:41.169
You don't have shit.

26:41.320 --> 26:44.369
Now, I'm happy to help.
I'm a nice guy.

26:44.520 --> 26:48.366
But we can't
just give things away for free.

26:48.520 --> 26:51.808
How's this?
Since you can't offer much,

26:52.000 --> 26:54.207
I'll let your people
work here for their share.

26:54.360 --> 26:56.761
You'd be a welcome addition
to the community,

26:56.920 --> 26:59.526
a smart and beautiful woman.

26:59.720 --> 27:02.530
Getting back
to that common tongue,

27:02.720 --> 27:05.041
I can tell ya,
I can make it worth your while.

27:05.200 --> 27:07.567
- Let me stop you right there.
- Listen, honey.

27:07.720 --> 27:11.281
Stop coming on to me
with calling me "honey."

27:11.480 --> 27:13.130
You don't have
any ammunition.

27:13.280 --> 27:16.489
- Who said that?
- You're low on medication.

27:16.640 --> 27:19.166
You need things.
We need things.

27:19.360 --> 27:21.647
What, are you gonna give us a bottle
of aspirin and a box of bullets?

27:21.800 --> 27:24.371
Our communities
can help each other.

27:26.320 --> 27:29.449
Thank you, Natalie.
Been a good talk.

27:33.760 --> 27:35.489
We can help each other.

27:35.640 --> 27:37.483
We're doing fine.

27:37.640 --> 27:39.483
Are you?

27:50.120 --> 27:52.726
Jesus: We want to generate trade.
Gregory does.

27:52.880 --> 27:54.803
But ammo isn't something
we urgently need.

27:54.960 --> 27:57.008
- Well, how's that?
- The walls hold.

27:57.160 --> 27:58.764
We just brought in
more medicine.

27:58.920 --> 28:00.763
Gregory wants
the best deal possible.

28:00.920 --> 28:03.082
Yeah, well,
we want things, too.

28:03.280 --> 28:04.930
Rick:
We need food.

28:05.120 --> 28:07.771
We came all this way,
we're gonna get it.

28:09.600 --> 28:11.967
I will talk to him

28:12.120 --> 28:14.168
and we will work this out.

28:16.280 --> 28:17.725
Circumstances change.

28:17.920 --> 28:21.811
We're doing well now,
and you will next.

28:21.960 --> 28:25.043
I will make him
understand that.

28:25.200 --> 28:27.407
Can you give me a few days?

28:31.640 --> 28:33.165
We can.

28:38.640 --> 28:41.405
Yeah.

28:41.560 --> 28:43.369
( Chuckles )

28:43.520 --> 28:45.522
(faint yelling)

28:48.320 --> 28:51.164
- What's wrong?
- They're back.

29:04.320 --> 29:06.800
Gregory: Nathan, what happened
to everybody else?

29:06.960 --> 29:09.281
Where's Tim and Marsha?

29:09.440 --> 29:10.805
They're dead.

29:13.480 --> 29:16.723
- Negan?
- Yeah.

29:16.880 --> 29:19.531
- We had a deal.
- Man: He said it wasn't enough.

29:19.680 --> 29:21.921
Was the drop light?

29:22.080 --> 29:23.366
Gregory:
No.

29:23.520 --> 29:25.363
They still have Craig.

29:25.520 --> 29:29.445
They said they'd keep him alive,
return him to us,

29:29.600 --> 29:31.841
if I deliver a message to you.

29:32.040 --> 29:33.530
So, tell me.

29:34.840 --> 29:36.251
I'm sorry.

29:36.400 --> 29:38.004
( Groans )

29:39.960 --> 29:42.531
Get off of me!
I had to!

29:42.680 --> 29:44.489
(grunting )

30:02.080 --> 30:03.127
- ( ears ringing)
- ( heart pounding )

30:03.320 --> 30:04.845
Sasha's voice:
Maybe that's why.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.446
Because the way things go.

30:08.840 --> 30:10.251
( Screams )

30:11.720 --> 30:13.529
- ( yells)
- Glenn: Hey!

30:13.680 --> 30:16.047
Stay back!
Anybody who tries to stop me

30:16.200 --> 30:17.804
is killing my brother!

30:21.600 --> 30:24.171
Michonne:
Drop it.

30:24.320 --> 30:26.482
( Splattering )

30:33.840 --> 30:35.922
(groaning )

30:39.760 --> 30:40.921
(groaning )

30:49.680 --> 30:51.569
What?

30:51.720 --> 30:54.564
Nathan!
You killed him.

30:54.720 --> 30:57.041
He tried to kill Gregory,
then me.

30:57.200 --> 30:59.123
(grunts)

30:59.280 --> 31:00.611
Ah!

31:00.760 --> 31:02.171
Don't.

31:02.320 --> 31:04.971
Drop it now!

31:05.120 --> 31:08.124
- I don't think I will.
- Everyone, this is over!

31:08.280 --> 31:10.408
( Panting )

31:10.560 --> 31:11.800
It's over.

31:11.960 --> 31:15.567
Ethan was our friend,
but let's not pretend

31:15.720 --> 31:18.371
he was anything more than
a coward who attacked us.

31:18.560 --> 31:20.722
He did this.

31:22.440 --> 31:24.124
And these people stopped him.

31:25.800 --> 31:27.962
( Sobbing )

31:31.560 --> 31:33.483
What can I do?

31:33.640 --> 31:36.291
Put the gun away.

31:36.440 --> 31:38.568
You've done enough.

31:42.160 --> 31:43.924
You need to know

31:44.080 --> 31:46.481
that things aren't as simple
as they might seem.

31:48.640 --> 31:50.483
Just give me some time.

31:57.360 --> 31:59.044
(groaning )

32:04.040 --> 32:06.008
- Daryl: Hey, man.
- Huh?

32:06.160 --> 32:07.605
You good?

32:07.760 --> 32:09.967
Yeah.

32:10.120 --> 32:12.361
I'm better than all right.

32:12.520 --> 32:14.682
( laughs )

32:14.840 --> 32:16.365
(Abraham grunts )

32:26.880 --> 32:29.406
( door opens )

32:29.560 --> 32:32.040
Jesus: Dr. Carson
was able to patch Gregory up.

32:32.200 --> 32:34.362
He's in pain, but he'll live.

32:34.520 --> 32:37.410
Michonne:
So, what happens now?

32:37.600 --> 32:39.443
Jesus: Things like that
don't usually happen here,

32:39.640 --> 32:42.883
but, uh, it's settled.

32:43.040 --> 32:45.520
We heard the name Negan.

32:45.680 --> 32:49.890
A while back, Daryl and Abraham
had a run-in with his men.

32:50.040 --> 32:51.565
Who is he?

32:51.720 --> 32:55.406
Negan's the head of a group
of people he calls the Saviors.

32:55.560 --> 32:59.724
As soon as the walls were built,
the Saviors showed up.

32:59.880 --> 33:02.486
They met with Gregory
on behalf of their boss.

33:02.640 --> 33:06.929
They made a lot of demands,
even more threats.

33:07.080 --> 33:10.607
And he killed one of us--
Rory.

33:10.800 --> 33:13.246
He was 16 years old.

33:13.400 --> 33:17.644
They beat him to death
right in front of us.

33:17.800 --> 33:21.566
Said we needed to understand,
right off the bat.

33:23.240 --> 33:26.210
Gregory's not exactly good
at confrontation.

33:26.360 --> 33:27.771
He's not the leader
I would've chosen,

33:27.920 --> 33:30.571
but he helped make
this place what it is,

33:30.720 --> 33:31.960
and the people like him.

33:32.120 --> 33:33.963
He made the deal.

33:34.120 --> 33:35.929
Jesus:
Half of everything.

33:36.080 --> 33:38.811
Our supplies, our crops,

33:38.960 --> 33:42.726
our livestock,
it goes to the Saviors.

33:42.880 --> 33:45.121
Glenn: And what do you get
in return?

33:45.280 --> 33:48.602
They don't attack this place.
They don't kill us.

33:48.760 --> 33:50.649
Why not just kill them?

33:50.840 --> 33:53.047
Most of the people here
don't even know how to fight,

33:53.200 --> 33:54.326
even if we had ammo.

33:54.480 --> 33:56.801
Well, how many people
does Negan have?

33:56.960 --> 33:58.121
We don't know.

33:58.280 --> 34:00.089
We've seen groups as big as 20.

34:00.240 --> 34:03.005
Now, hold up.
So, they show up, they kill a kid,

34:03.160 --> 34:05.640
and you give them half
of everything?

34:05.800 --> 34:07.484
These dicks just got
a good story.

34:07.640 --> 34:10.803
- The bogeyman, he ain't shit.
- Well, how do you know?

34:10.960 --> 34:14.168
A month ago,
we took his guys out PDQ.

34:14.360 --> 34:16.806
Left them in pieces
and puddles.

34:16.960 --> 34:19.167
You know, we'll do it.

34:19.320 --> 34:22.529
If we go get your man back,
kill Negan, take out his boys,

34:22.679 --> 34:24.284
will you hook us up?

34:24.440 --> 34:27.045
We want food, medicine,
and one of them cows.

34:29.000 --> 34:33.289
Confrontation's never been
something we've had trouble with.

34:38.159 --> 34:39.969
I'll take it to Gregory.

34:50.520 --> 34:54.127
They have food, we don't.

34:54.320 --> 34:56.766
We don't have enough
of anything.

34:56.920 --> 34:59.890
Except us.

35:00.040 --> 35:02.441
What we can do.

35:06.400 --> 35:09.244
This is the trade.

35:10.560 --> 35:12.688
It's gonna cost us something.

35:14.680 --> 35:16.808
( Door opens )

35:18.600 --> 35:21.683
Gregory's up.
He wants to talk.

35:23.760 --> 35:25.922
To Maggie.

35:26.080 --> 35:29.163
He wants to talk to Maggie.

35:29.320 --> 35:31.084
You got this.

35:33.600 --> 35:35.602
Deanna was right about you.

35:39.240 --> 35:42.244
I'm sorry in advance.
Gregory can be a real prick.

35:42.400 --> 35:43.890
I know.

35:44.040 --> 35:45.883
( Knock on door)

35:46.080 --> 35:48.765
Come in.

35:48.920 --> 35:53.448
Mm.
Sorry for the gloom.

35:53.600 --> 35:56.410
They have me
on these antibiotics

35:56.560 --> 35:59.564
that make me sensitive
to the sunlight.

35:59.760 --> 36:01.808
This is agony.

36:01.960 --> 36:05.282
It's like somebody's twisting
my intestines with a cement mixer.

36:05.440 --> 36:07.363
It could've been worse.

36:07.560 --> 36:09.847
You're lucky we were here.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.889
Jesus told you
about our offer?

36:12.040 --> 36:13.246
He did.

36:13.440 --> 36:15.169
What makes you think
you can do what we haven't done?

36:15.320 --> 36:17.891
We've handled people
like Negan.

36:18.040 --> 36:21.249
- How?
- They're dead.

36:21.400 --> 36:23.050
We can get your man back.

36:25.440 --> 36:27.920
I don't know if Craig's
worth the trouble.

36:28.120 --> 36:30.441
I mean, it's his brother
who did this.

36:30.600 --> 36:35.049
He was fighting to save
someone he loves.

36:35.200 --> 36:39.125
- He was afraid.
- That makes him weak.

36:39.280 --> 36:41.681
Frankly, I don't know
if I want him back in our gene pool.

36:41.880 --> 36:45.965
My dad used to tell me forgiveness
takes more strength than anger.

36:46.120 --> 36:48.521
Yeah, I guess.

36:48.720 --> 36:50.165
He's a hell of a cook.

36:50.320 --> 36:53.483
He makes these amazing baked eggs
with green tomatoes.

36:53.640 --> 36:56.803
You give us supplies,
we'll save Craig

36:56.960 --> 36:59.691
and take care of Negan
and the Saviors, permanently.

36:59.840 --> 37:01.490
( Gregory laughs )

37:01.640 --> 37:04.644
I'm sorry, I find this whole
conversation pretty funny.

37:04.800 --> 37:07.246
I mean, you balked
when I proposed

37:07.400 --> 37:10.643
that your people work
for our supplies, but now...

37:10.800 --> 37:13.280
isn't that exactly
what's happening here?

37:13.440 --> 37:16.728
See, I had leverage
and I used it.

37:16.920 --> 37:19.321
See?
It wasn't personal.

37:19.480 --> 37:21.164
Yes.

37:21.320 --> 37:24.403
We need food. You have it.

37:24.560 --> 37:26.562
We're willing to work for it.

37:29.320 --> 37:31.971
Then I'll get supplies
for your people.

37:32.120 --> 37:33.645
Good.

37:33.800 --> 37:37.646
I'll talk to Jesus
and he'll make the arrangements.

37:37.800 --> 37:39.802
See, this was fun.

37:41.560 --> 37:43.562
Exciting.

37:47.200 --> 37:49.009
Half.

37:49.200 --> 37:50.361
Excuse me?

37:50.520 --> 37:52.966
Half of what you have.

37:53.160 --> 37:55.208
I saw what happened
out there.

37:55.360 --> 37:58.682
Negan's expecting
more supplies from this place.

37:58.840 --> 38:01.571
And more and more.

38:01.720 --> 38:03.085
And if it keeps going
like that,

38:03.240 --> 38:05.846
pretty soon you won't
have anything left.

38:07.360 --> 38:09.362
What happens then?

38:09.520 --> 38:13.650
Without ammo,
without fighters...

38:13.800 --> 38:15.802
you'd be a dead man.

38:18.960 --> 38:21.201
So half of everything you have

38:21.400 --> 38:23.562
right now...

38:23.720 --> 38:25.848
or the deal's off.

38:27.080 --> 38:29.560
You see?

38:29.720 --> 38:32.724
I have leverage.

38:32.880 --> 38:36.407
( Groans )

38:36.560 --> 38:39.211
Congratulations.

38:39.360 --> 38:42.409
You have yourself a deal.

38:42.560 --> 38:45.564
You want anything else?
Kidney, maybe?

38:45.760 --> 38:47.888
Not that...

38:48.040 --> 38:50.042
but I do want something.

38:57.640 --> 39:00.450
Jesus: Even Negan didn't get
this much up front.

39:03.680 --> 39:05.091
Andy:
What?

39:05.240 --> 39:09.086
Jesus said you've been taking supplies
to Negan since the beginning.

39:10.440 --> 39:12.568
We're gonna get Craig back.

39:12.720 --> 39:16.122
The only way to get Craig back
is to bring them Gregory's head.

39:17.440 --> 39:19.283
We're gonna get Craig back.

39:19.440 --> 39:21.010
How?

39:21.160 --> 39:23.811
We need to know what you know
about Negan's compound.

39:25.280 --> 39:27.408
We need your help.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.921
We need you to come.

39:38.440 --> 39:40.488
Yeah.

39:40.640 --> 39:42.483
Okay.

39:52.960 --> 39:55.440
You got room
for one more, right?

39:55.600 --> 39:58.843
I mean, we're talking about
righting the world here.

39:59.040 --> 40:00.644
Plus, you still have my knives.

40:00.800 --> 40:02.529
( Chuckles )

40:07.160 --> 40:09.208
Hey. you up for this?

40:10.400 --> 40:11.970
It's gonna be a fight.

40:12.120 --> 40:14.487
We'll win.

40:14.680 --> 40:16.205
We have to.

40:18.880 --> 40:20.882
We'll win.

40:45.200 --> 40:47.885
( Pulse whirring )

41:01.120 --> 41:02.406
( sighs )

42:22.240 --> 42:25.130
( theme music playing )
