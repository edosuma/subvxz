00:07.155 --> 00:08.587
This week on "Vice,"

00:08.622 --> 00:11.023
a deep dive into Russian hacking.

00:19.783 --> 00:22.133
Is there any personal
information of mine

00:22.169 --> 00:23.769
that you couldn't have gotten access to?

00:23.804 --> 00:27.138
If someone wants to hack
you, they're gonna be able to.

00:27.174 --> 00:29.140
And then, the race to stop

00:29.176 --> 00:30.809
the next global pandemic.

00:30.924 --> 00:33.659
We are walking into the Zika Forest.

00:33.694 --> 00:36.061
There are mosquitoes flying
all around me right now.

00:36.096 --> 00:37.696
Doesn't fill me with warm and fuzzies.

00:38.766 --> 00:40.832
Outbreaks are inevitable,

00:40.868 --> 00:42.701
pandemics are optional.

00:49.242 --> 00:50.542
Go, go, go!

00:53.246 --> 00:54.979
We are not animals!

01:06.526 --> 01:08.393
Russia's been in the news a lot lately

01:08.428 --> 01:12.297
for allegedly hacking
the 2016 US election.

01:12.332 --> 01:13.665
The Russian government pursued

01:13.700 --> 01:15.600
a multi-faceted influence campaign

01:15.635 --> 01:17.134
in the run-up to the election,

01:17.170 --> 01:20.104
including aggressive use
of cyber-capabilities.

01:20.139 --> 01:21.673
Russian cyber-criminals

01:21.708 --> 01:24.375
have been accused of everything
from digital bank robberies

01:24.411 --> 01:26.944
to tampering with
critical infrastructure.

01:26.979 --> 01:29.379
So we sent Gianna Toboni to investigate

01:29.415 --> 01:31.448
the severity of this growing threat.

01:46.432 --> 01:48.432
We're about an hour
outside of Portland, Maine.

01:48.467 --> 01:50.567
It's a pretty rural part of the state,

01:50.603 --> 01:53.204
and we're heading into
this Sheriff's Department,

01:53.239 --> 01:54.605
because they've been hacked,

01:54.640 --> 01:57.875
along with every other police
department in the county.

01:57.910 --> 02:00.643
This is the office where
we received the virus.

02:00.678 --> 02:03.146
Um, it was downloaded from an e-mail,

02:03.181 --> 02:05.014
um, right here at this terminal.

02:05.050 --> 02:07.483
We didn't know anything
had happened until, again,

02:07.518 --> 02:08.818
the system started to slow down.

02:08.854 --> 02:11.988
Files weren't accessible, we
started getting error messages.

02:12.023 --> 02:14.023
This is a copy

02:14.059 --> 02:16.793
of the ransom information.

02:16.828 --> 02:19.963
Now, right on the top here
it has "Cryptowall 3.0."

02:19.998 --> 02:21.731
It was a readme-type file.

02:21.767 --> 02:24.200
Um... don't ask me to explain that.

02:24.236 --> 02:25.735
Um, "What does this mean?

02:25.771 --> 02:28.704
This means that the structure
and data within your files

02:28.740 --> 02:31.074
have been irrevocably changed,

02:31.109 --> 02:33.709
um, and you won't be
able to work with them,

02:33.745 --> 02:35.478
read them, or see them."

02:35.513 --> 02:37.580
What did you end up
doing after you read this?

02:37.615 --> 02:40.283
We ended up clicking on the...

02:40.318 --> 02:43.286
the IT folks went to the, um...

02:43.321 --> 02:45.954
the http address,

02:45.990 --> 02:47.423
and were able to locate

02:47.458 --> 02:50.726
the request for ransom

02:50.762 --> 02:53.663
that they were asking for in bitcoin.

02:53.698 --> 02:55.130
I'd never heard of a bitcoin...

02:55.166 --> 02:57.667
... at that point, myself.
You know what I mean?

02:57.702 --> 03:00.169
You know, we're a law
enforcement agency, right?

03:00.204 --> 03:01.570
And my first reaction was,

03:01.606 --> 03:04.407
"I'll be damned if I pay ransom."

03:04.442 --> 03:06.509
It's the cardinal rule,
right? Never negotiate.

03:06.544 --> 03:08.344
We're the police, you can't ransom us.

03:08.379 --> 03:12.214
Which, uh, obviously I
had a rude awakening there,

03:12.249 --> 03:13.748
and actually, I was really surprised

03:13.784 --> 03:16.051
when our IT folks recommended that...

03:16.086 --> 03:16.985
that we pay the ransom.

03:17.021 --> 03:19.621
We've made several changes since then,

03:19.656 --> 03:21.389
and we were not successful.

03:21.425 --> 03:24.693
Another e-mail came
through, and low and behold,

03:24.728 --> 03:27.429
we started to experience
the problem again.

03:27.464 --> 03:28.897
You guys paid twice.

03:28.933 --> 03:31.433
What makes you think these
hackers won't come back again?

03:31.468 --> 03:35.237
We've been fortunate not to
have encountered the virus again,

03:35.272 --> 03:37.672
but I'm not kidding myself.

03:37.708 --> 03:39.674
I don't believe we're a
hundred percent immune.

03:39.710 --> 03:42.978
A cyber-attack has spread
to every corner of the world.

03:43.013 --> 03:45.647
Lincoln County, Maine, is not alone.

03:45.682 --> 03:48.416
Across the country,
thousands of police stations,

03:48.452 --> 03:50.184
hospitals, and businesses,

03:50.220 --> 03:52.253
have been hit by ransomware attacks.

03:52.288 --> 03:53.555
In 2016 alone,

03:53.590 --> 03:55.923
Americans paid close
to a billion dollars

03:55.959 --> 03:57.392
in digital ransom.

03:57.427 --> 03:59.193
This massive uptick in attacks

03:59.229 --> 04:01.796
has the Department of Homeland
Security on high alert.

04:01.832 --> 04:04.212
We went to their National Cybersecurity

04:04.213 --> 04:06.200
& Communications Integration Center

04:06.236 --> 04:08.670
to see just how dire the situation is.

04:12.308 --> 04:14.075
Thank you.

04:14.110 --> 04:18.045
So, in order to get into
this control room here,

04:18.081 --> 04:20.814
yeah, we've got to
leave our phones behind.

04:20.850 --> 04:23.216
Ultra secure in here.

04:25.087 --> 04:26.353
Wow.

04:27.523 --> 04:29.623
So, this is our main watch-floor

04:29.658 --> 04:31.124
for the National Cybersecurity

04:31.159 --> 04:33.093
& Communications Integration Center.

04:33.128 --> 04:36.597
And this is where we have
our 24/7 watch operations

04:36.632 --> 04:39.165
looking for threats and incidents

04:39.201 --> 04:40.701
across the federal government

04:40.736 --> 04:44.004
and in our critical
infrastructures domestically.

04:44.039 --> 04:46.239
- We're hearing a lot about ransomware.
- Mm-hmm.

04:46.275 --> 04:47.875
- Are you concerned about that?
- Yes.

04:47.910 --> 04:51.745
Ransomware has expanded significantly.

04:51.781 --> 04:56.416
Existing organizations are now
taking advantage of the Internet.

04:56.451 --> 04:58.951
What is the nature
of the type of hacking

04:58.986 --> 05:00.386
that we see in the US

05:00.422 --> 05:02.922
that originates in
Russian-speaking countries?

05:02.957 --> 05:06.125
Everything from cyber-criminals,

05:06.160 --> 05:10.095
um, to more organized capabilities,

05:10.131 --> 05:14.300
and the Russian influence
in our election process.

05:14.335 --> 05:17.102
We put out, um,

05:17.138 --> 05:20.773
what we call a joint-analysis
report back in December.

05:20.809 --> 05:23.342
This report was the first
time government officials

05:23.377 --> 05:26.746
published evidence of the
2016 Russian election hack,

05:26.781 --> 05:28.814
which showed Russia's
ability to penetrate

05:28.849 --> 05:30.582
major American networks.

05:30.617 --> 05:34.153
To understand why Russia has
become such a hub for hacking,

05:34.188 --> 05:35.687
we traveled to Moscow.

05:46.434 --> 05:49.068
Andrei Soldatov is an
investigative journalist

05:49.103 --> 05:51.170
who recently wrote a definitive account

05:51.205 --> 05:53.138
of Russia's cyber-espionage.

05:53.174 --> 05:54.606
Of course, it was huge news in the US

05:54.641 --> 05:57.242
when the DNC and Clinton
campaign e-mails were hacked,

05:57.278 --> 06:00.545
but is there really any evidence
to show that direct link?

06:08.822 --> 06:10.522
And how do we know that?

06:16.096 --> 06:18.196
So you can say with
certainty that those hackers

06:18.231 --> 06:20.632
were working with the
Russian government?

07:22.995 --> 07:25.395
To actually see Russian hacking at work,

07:25.431 --> 07:26.664
we went to one of the country's

07:26.699 --> 07:28.699
biggest gatherings of hackers.

07:30.402 --> 07:33.203
Welcome to Russia's biggest
cyber-security conference.

07:33.238 --> 07:36.139
You have guys who are hacking
into ATM machines right here,

07:36.175 --> 07:38.208
into BMWs, Teslas.

07:38.243 --> 07:40.743
The average age here is probably 25, 26.

07:40.779 --> 07:44.113
You have teenagers. Everyone
seems to be under 30.

07:46.350 --> 07:48.551
Cyber-security expert
and even organizer,

07:48.587 --> 07:50.920
Andrew Bershadsky, showed us around.

08:13.955 --> 08:15.410
All right, so what are
you excited about here?

08:15.411 --> 08:16.678
Can you show me some things?

09:08.998 --> 09:10.808
So, what's their angle?
If they attack this,

09:10.809 --> 09:11.909
what do they want to happen?

09:35.757 --> 09:37.724
We wanted to see hacking in real-time,

09:37.759 --> 09:40.260
so we asked former NSA
hacker, Patrick Wardle,

09:40.296 --> 09:42.696
and his associate, Mikhail Sosonkin,

09:42.731 --> 09:45.232
to put my personal
cyber-security to the test.

09:45.267 --> 09:47.534
Well, you know, this was
your first hacker conference,

09:47.570 --> 09:50.870
and we really wanted to make
the experience very authentic,

09:50.906 --> 09:52.906
so we decided to just

09:52.941 --> 09:55.974
hack you in as many ways as possible.

09:56.010 --> 09:58.110
While I thought our crew was
filming background footage,

09:58.145 --> 10:01.814
they were in fact
capturing me getting hacked.

10:01.849 --> 10:04.684
Generally, there's two
main ways to hack people:

10:04.719 --> 10:06.919
Remotely and with physical access.

10:06.954 --> 10:10.356
Um, so we designed some
attacks to do both of these.

10:10.391 --> 10:13.058
Basically, we set up
wireless access points

10:13.094 --> 10:16.262
and we made it look like
it was a hotel Wi-Fi.

10:16.297 --> 10:18.063
But it was, like, a
little thing that suggested

10:18.099 --> 10:20.032
the correct one... it says "guest."

10:20.067 --> 10:22.032
So you probably thought
that that's the one

10:22.033 --> 10:23.803
- you should be connecting to.
- Oh, wow.

10:23.837 --> 10:25.304
So, when you connected to it,

10:25.340 --> 10:26.639
everything you entered in there,

10:26.674 --> 10:28.741
like your last name, your room number,

10:28.776 --> 10:30.809
we basically collected that.

10:30.845 --> 10:33.612
Hotel room numbers... it's
kind of what hotels use

10:33.647 --> 10:35.680
- as an authentication key.
- Oh, my God.

10:35.716 --> 10:37.446
And with that, then we were able

10:37.447 --> 10:39.218
to pull off a social engineering attack,

10:39.253 --> 10:41.653
which gave us a copy of your room key.

10:42.623 --> 10:43.622
Good afternoon.

10:43.657 --> 10:46.825
Could you print another
key for my room, please?

10:46.861 --> 10:49.862
We needed someone to
impersonate you, essentially,

10:49.897 --> 10:52.064
and we had my lovely wife, Diana,

10:52.099 --> 10:53.698
call up the reception and say,

10:53.734 --> 10:57.202
"Hey, can you please give
my colleague another key?"

10:57.538 --> 11:00.372
My co-worker, Gianna,
she's in room 2086.

11:00.407 --> 11:01.811
No other questions asked,

11:01.812 --> 11:03.411
they gave me a key to your room.

11:03.477 --> 11:06.611
Then with that, we were able
to gain access to your room,

11:06.647 --> 11:08.513
where we installed some hidden cameras

11:08.548 --> 11:11.015
so we could see, when
you access the safe,

11:11.084 --> 11:12.584
- what the keypad was.
- Wow.

11:12.619 --> 11:13.685
So, even if you had put your laptop

11:13.720 --> 11:15.987
or your phone in there,
it wouldn't have mattered,

11:16.022 --> 11:17.689
- we could have gotten in.
- You could have gotten in.

11:17.724 --> 11:22.059
So, at this point, we kind of had
complete access to your laptop...

11:23.530 --> 11:25.497
- There's the binary.
- Nice.

11:25.532 --> 11:27.465
What we basically did was we installed

11:27.501 --> 11:29.967
something called a
backdoor on your system,

11:30.003 --> 11:33.271
that would then connect out
to a computer we controlled,

11:33.307 --> 11:36.508
allowing us to execute
commands on your computer.

11:36.543 --> 11:38.309
So, at that point, we
could share your screen,

11:38.344 --> 11:41.044
see exactly what you were
looking at at all times.

11:41.079 --> 11:42.946
Uh, we could record off the webcam

11:42.981 --> 11:44.981
to watch you as you
walked around the room,

11:45.017 --> 11:47.451
hijack your Skype sessions.

11:47.486 --> 11:48.919
So, how did you get my
credit card information?

11:48.954 --> 11:50.545
Every time you press a button,

11:50.546 --> 11:51.955
there is an event that
happens in the machine,

11:51.990 --> 11:53.724
and we can capture
that. You can see here,

11:53.759 --> 11:55.192
we have your credit card information

11:55.227 --> 11:57.695
from when you were
booking your trip to Cuba.

11:57.730 --> 12:00.364
Is there any personal
information of mine

12:00.399 --> 12:02.466
that you couldn't have gotten access to?

12:02.501 --> 12:03.667
I don't think so.

12:03.703 --> 12:06.169
So, you could have
hijacked my whole identity?

12:06.205 --> 12:08.038
Yeah, and you know, the
attacks we pulled off here

12:08.073 --> 12:10.574
really weren't hyper sophisticated,

12:10.609 --> 12:13.643
so I always like to say, if
someone wants to hack you,

12:13.678 --> 12:16.078
- they're gonna be able to.
- Yeah.

12:16.113 --> 12:18.348
We bought you some souvenirs.

12:18.383 --> 12:19.816
This is, obviously, the flag of Russia.

12:19.851 --> 12:22.952
- Thank you very much.
- Actually, you know, we used your credit card, so.

12:22.987 --> 12:24.354
Right.

12:24.389 --> 12:26.222
Cyber-attacks originating in Russia

12:26.257 --> 12:28.057
have become increasingly brazen,

12:28.092 --> 12:32.228
including a data breach of more
than 500 million Yahoo Mail accounts

12:32.263 --> 12:35.732
and a scheme that stole
160 million credit cards

12:35.767 --> 12:37.367
from American corporations.

12:37.402 --> 12:41.003
Russian cyber-security firm,
Group IB, hunts hackers.

12:41.038 --> 12:42.938
They showed us online hacker forums

12:42.974 --> 12:45.974
filled with troves of stolen data.

13:16.707 --> 13:19.573
We're looking at websites that are D.C.,

13:19.609 --> 13:21.041
US government websites,

13:21.076 --> 13:22.175
and when we click on them,

13:22.211 --> 13:24.512
you can see the username and the login.

13:24.547 --> 13:27.047
Uh, it's all the information
to access these accounts.

13:27.082 --> 13:29.750
So, these people may not know

13:29.786 --> 13:32.953
that her e-mail has been hacked?

13:34.724 --> 13:35.823
Wow.

13:37.259 --> 13:39.293
So, my name could be in
there. I wouldn't even know.

13:55.143 --> 13:56.242
These cyber crimes

13:56.277 --> 13:57.911
are committed by blackhat hackers

13:57.946 --> 14:01.047
who can steal critical
data and damage networks.

14:01.082 --> 14:02.949
They exist anonymously on the web,

14:02.984 --> 14:05.618
but we found one who
agreed to talk to us.

14:06.988 --> 14:07.921
Hi, there.

14:09.090 --> 14:11.023
Gianna. Nice to meet you.

14:11.059 --> 14:12.992
- Gianna. Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

14:20.502 --> 14:23.202
Though he first hesitated,
Kostya eventually agreed

14:23.237 --> 14:25.104
to show us some of his hacks.

14:59.273 --> 15:02.006
And, so, what are you doing with
all this personal information?

15:08.548 --> 15:11.081
And then what will they
use that information for?

15:25.631 --> 15:26.773
What's the most amount of money

15:26.774 --> 15:29.200
you've made off of a hack like this one?

15:34.707 --> 15:37.007
Spurred by the trillions
of dollars online

15:37.043 --> 15:38.975
and a generation raised on the Web,

15:39.011 --> 15:41.311
hacking from Russia
and around the world,

15:41.347 --> 15:42.746
is flourishing.

15:42.781 --> 15:44.781
And increasingly, hackers are targeting

15:44.816 --> 15:46.983
the world's most lucrative market,

15:47.019 --> 15:48.152
the US.

15:48.187 --> 15:49.553
But at DHS,

15:49.588 --> 15:52.789
the first line of defense
are hackers themselves.

15:52.824 --> 15:55.192
I hack into agencies, and then,

15:55.227 --> 15:56.326
after the hacking is done,

15:56.362 --> 15:57.827
I go in, and I teach them how we did it,

15:57.863 --> 16:00.431
so then, they can actually go
through and fix those vulnerabilities

16:00.466 --> 16:02.599
so the actual bad guys can't get in.

16:02.634 --> 16:04.568
That's a map of 82,000

16:04.603 --> 16:06.603
critical infrastructures
sites in the United States

16:06.638 --> 16:08.539
that are basically exposed
directly to the Internet.

16:08.574 --> 16:11.140
- Wow.
- We're talking about water systems,

16:11.176 --> 16:13.209
manufacturing plants,
building automation.

16:13.244 --> 16:16.746
When you start to aggregate
it at a scale of 82,000, right,

16:16.782 --> 16:19.683
now, intruding upon a lot
of those systems all at once

16:19.718 --> 16:21.952
could cause, you know,
a significant issue.

16:21.987 --> 16:25.021
How do you see
cyber-attacks, uh, advancing,

16:25.057 --> 16:26.923
in the next 10, 20, 30 years?

16:26.959 --> 16:29.926
At a technical level, we're
gonna be constantly evolving.

16:29.962 --> 16:32.596
As adversaries create new capabilities,

16:32.631 --> 16:33.863
we'll create new countermeasures.

16:33.899 --> 16:36.365
As we advance past their
capabilities with countermeasures,

16:36.401 --> 16:38.134
they'll create new capabilities.

16:38.169 --> 16:41.738
It's always gonna be that kind
of arms race type of activity.

16:41.773 --> 16:44.007
I think this problem is one that...

16:44.042 --> 16:45.808
it's certainly one that we can work on,

16:45.843 --> 16:48.211
but I don't think it's ever
gonna completely go away.

16:48.246 --> 16:50.313
This is gonna be with us
for a long time, I think.

16:53.618 --> 16:56.852
Since 1980, outbreaks
of infectious diseases

16:56.887 --> 16:58.554
have more than tripled worldwide.

16:58.590 --> 17:00.623
Nearly every year,
somewhere around the globe,

17:00.658 --> 17:02.525
a different disease has emerged,

17:02.560 --> 17:05.394
leading to varying degrees of
infection and widespread panic.

17:05.430 --> 17:09.397
Fear of Ebola in infected
countries and beyond, is palpable.

17:09.434 --> 17:11.166
Bird Flu has hit North America.

17:11.202 --> 17:13.769
As our world continues to
become more interconnected,

17:13.804 --> 17:15.637
the threat of one of these outbreaks

17:15.673 --> 17:17.540
growing into a global pandemic

17:17.575 --> 17:19.307
is becoming increasingly real.

17:19.343 --> 17:21.609
To see if and how we
can actually prevent

17:21.646 --> 17:23.578
this next pandemic from happening,

17:23.614 --> 17:26.815
we sent Suroosh Alvi to
the Zika Forest in Uganda.

17:43.034 --> 17:45.834
So, we are walking into
the Zika Forest right now.

17:45.870 --> 17:47.235
We're with our pals

17:47.271 --> 17:50.872
from the Uganda Virus
Research Institute.

17:50.907 --> 17:53.575
We are gonna set up some insect traps,

17:53.610 --> 17:55.677
and discover new viruses.

18:18.401 --> 18:21.570
So, this is the very tower that was used

18:21.605 --> 18:24.306
to discover the original Zika virus?

18:24.341 --> 18:26.040
It was right here?

18:26.076 --> 18:29.543
Long before the Zika outbreak
in Brazil caused global panic,

18:29.579 --> 18:33.047
it was first discovered
here in Uganda in 1947.

18:33.083 --> 18:35.049
Pathogens are constantly mutating

18:35.085 --> 18:36.918
and acquiring new traits,

18:36.953 --> 18:39.320
so researchers monitor the mosquitoes

18:39.355 --> 18:41.122
to track the emerging infections

18:41.157 --> 18:43.124
that could ignite the next pandemic.

18:46.930 --> 18:48.329
Okay.

18:48.364 --> 18:50.397
There are mosquitoes flying
all around me right now.

18:50.433 --> 18:52.734
Doesn't fill me with warm and fuzzies.

18:53.837 --> 18:55.302
Tropical forests like this

18:55.338 --> 18:57.404
are breeding grounds for new viruses.

18:57.440 --> 18:59.873
Once untouched, human populations

18:59.908 --> 19:03.344
now destroy around seven million
hectares of forest each year,

19:03.379 --> 19:06.012
allowing diseases to have an easier time

19:06.048 --> 19:08.081
getting into human populations.

19:08.117 --> 19:09.650
There are houses right there.

19:09.685 --> 19:12.052
There's been encroachment
upon the forest,

19:12.087 --> 19:14.187
and the airport is just past the houses.

19:15.691 --> 19:17.057
What are the implications

19:17.092 --> 19:19.560
of people living so
close to this forest?

19:32.642 --> 19:33.741
Each year,

19:33.776 --> 19:35.408
a million people are killed

19:35.443 --> 19:37.510
by diseases transmitted from mosquitoes.

19:37.545 --> 19:40.446
And with increasing temperatures
and population growth,

19:40.482 --> 19:43.416
that death toll is expected
to climb in the coming years.

19:43.451 --> 19:46.419
The Zika vaccine trials
are progressing right now,

19:46.454 --> 19:49.589
and even though it's daunting
to vaccinate the entire world,

19:49.624 --> 19:52.725
scientists have proven
they can eliminate threats.

19:54.429 --> 19:55.795
In 1967,

19:55.830 --> 19:58.130
the World Health Organization
launched a campaign

19:58.166 --> 20:01.467
to eliminate one of the biggest
killers in human history.

20:01.503 --> 20:04.203
Dr. Larry Brilliant was part of the team

20:04.238 --> 20:05.638
that eradicated smallpox

20:05.674 --> 20:07.873
using a very simple concept.

20:07.909 --> 20:10.475
Instead of gong all
through India or Bangladesh

20:10.511 --> 20:12.043
and trying to vaccinate everybody,

20:12.078 --> 20:13.345
we got the idea

20:13.380 --> 20:15.314
that if we gave the vaccine

20:15.349 --> 20:16.848
only to those

20:16.883 --> 20:19.718
who were closest to an infected person,

20:19.753 --> 20:22.621
and you put a ring around
every infected person,

20:22.656 --> 20:24.423
with your scarce vaccine,

20:24.458 --> 20:26.291
you would abort the epidemic,

20:26.327 --> 20:27.926
and that's what worked.

20:27.961 --> 20:29.127
We have a lot of vaccines,

20:29.162 --> 20:32.096
but the vaccines we have
are for known viruses.

20:32.132 --> 20:34.566
When the next unknown virus

20:34.601 --> 20:36.100
jumps from an animal to a human,

20:36.136 --> 20:38.670
we're not gonna have
a vaccine on day one.

20:44.110 --> 20:45.743
These live bird markets are prevalent

20:45.778 --> 20:47.177
throughout the developing world,

20:47.213 --> 20:49.947
and the tight quarters
that these animals are in

20:49.982 --> 20:51.315
make it very easy

20:51.351 --> 20:53.517
for pathogens and infectious disease

20:53.553 --> 20:55.753
to spread from animals to humans.

20:58.725 --> 21:02.760
Almost 70% of human infections

21:02.795 --> 21:04.562
actually come from animals.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.397
Dr. Denis Byarugaba

21:06.432 --> 21:09.233
investigates the threat
of avian influenza

21:09.268 --> 21:11.001
in live bird markets.

21:11.036 --> 21:12.269
- Standing there...
- Yeah?

21:12.304 --> 21:15.339
... you could smell some
little bit of stuff...

21:15.375 --> 21:17.174
- Yeah.
- ... from the cages.

21:17.209 --> 21:20.377
Now, these are aerosols that
are coming from the cages.

21:20.412 --> 21:23.012
And should there be an
infection in those cages,

21:23.047 --> 21:24.447
you are automatically inhaling them.

21:24.483 --> 21:26.683
So, that smell that I
was smelling over there...

21:26.718 --> 21:29.118
what you are referring to as an aerosol,

21:29.153 --> 21:30.720
is potentially really bad for us?

21:30.756 --> 21:33.556
If there was any potential pathogen

21:33.592 --> 21:35.392
that was within those poultry,

21:35.427 --> 21:38.327
the likelihood that you would
pick it up from those aerosols,

21:38.363 --> 21:41.564
as the birds fluff their
feathers, is very high.

21:42.601 --> 21:44.534
There is a high concentration of poultry

21:44.569 --> 21:46.168
from different regions,

21:46.204 --> 21:49.506
where they are exposed and come
in with different infections.

21:49.541 --> 21:51.908
There is slaughtering of these birds

21:51.943 --> 21:53.208
within the markets,

21:53.243 --> 21:56.278
in very unhygienic conditions.

21:57.147 --> 21:59.247
And if these are zoonotic,

21:59.283 --> 22:01.817
then you expose and get this infection

22:01.852 --> 22:03.184
into the human population.

22:03.220 --> 22:05.954
Could you define or
explain what zoonosis is?

22:05.989 --> 22:08.323
Zoonosis is a disease
that is transmitted

22:08.358 --> 22:10.358
from animals to humans.

22:10.394 --> 22:13.395
The typical example is,
for example, influenza.

22:13.431 --> 22:14.996
And they are quite many.

22:17.301 --> 22:20.168
With the population
increases in these countries,

22:20.203 --> 22:23.705
should the world be afraid
of a crazy bird flu pandemic

22:23.741 --> 22:25.841
at a level that we've never seen before?

22:25.876 --> 22:28.476
For now, the major threat, actually,

22:28.511 --> 22:30.645
is those diseases that we are unable

22:30.680 --> 22:34.782
to find treatment for or contain.

22:34.818 --> 22:38.286
Each zoonotic disease
poses a unique threat.

22:38.322 --> 22:40.188
Transmitted from bodily fluids,

22:40.223 --> 22:41.856
the deadly Ebola epidemic

22:41.891 --> 22:44.692
was exacerbated by the
poorly-developed health systems

22:44.727 --> 22:47.829
and living conditions in West Africa.

22:47.864 --> 22:49.931
The SARS outbreak was less lethal

22:49.967 --> 22:52.467
but struck wealthy
countries as it went airborne

22:52.502 --> 22:55.370
and spread between people
in cities and hospitals.

22:55.405 --> 22:57.305
We are truly in the middle

22:57.341 --> 22:58.974
of the evolution of an epidemic.

22:59.009 --> 23:01.375
Global health systems were unprepared

23:01.410 --> 23:05.179
as these diseases devastated
people around the globe.

23:05.214 --> 23:07.615
But if a disease as deadly as Ebola

23:07.650 --> 23:09.817
can transmit through the air like SARS,

23:09.853 --> 23:11.719
the consequences would be dire.

23:11.754 --> 23:13.554
In the Netherlands,

23:13.590 --> 23:15.556
a scientist proved just how easily

23:15.592 --> 23:17.257
this mutation could occur.

23:17.293 --> 23:19.460
Dr. Ron Fouchier demonstrated

23:19.496 --> 23:23.030
how he genetically modified
the H5N1 bird flu virus

23:23.065 --> 23:25.399
to transmit through the air.

24:30.998 --> 24:35.468
A deadly airborne virus is
potentially a nightmare scenario,

24:35.503 --> 24:37.002
so why create it?

24:37.038 --> 24:40.706
To prove that the H5N1 bird flu virus

24:40.741 --> 24:43.942
could acquire the traits of
becoming airborne transmissible.

24:43.977 --> 24:46.678
So now we can find out
exactly what it takes

24:46.713 --> 24:50.382
for an animal virus to become airborne.

24:50.417 --> 24:52.517
Despite the breakthrough
of his findings,

24:52.553 --> 24:54.752
Dr. Fouchier's work sent shock waves

24:54.788 --> 24:56.555
through the international community.

24:56.590 --> 24:58.256
There were a lot of concerns about

24:58.292 --> 25:00.692
your findings being out in the public.

25:00.727 --> 25:04.062
Yes. So, when we submitted
our manuscript for publication,

25:04.098 --> 25:07.332
the US government judged
that our manuscript

25:07.367 --> 25:09.334
could be used by people to construct

25:09.369 --> 25:11.203
biological weapons of terror.

25:11.238 --> 25:14.406
We argued that the
information that we collected

25:14.441 --> 25:16.708
had to be sent back

25:16.743 --> 25:19.043
to the countries where
outbreaks are occurring

25:19.079 --> 25:22.346
to inform the people about
what to be on the lookout for.

25:22.381 --> 25:24.882
You eventually did
publish your findings,

25:24.918 --> 25:26.383
- is that correct?
- That's correct.

25:26.419 --> 25:29.754
We convinced the World
Health Organization

25:29.789 --> 25:31.623
to have a meeting with the countries

25:31.658 --> 25:33.324
that were facing outbreaks,

25:33.359 --> 25:36.393
to explain why they would
need the information.

25:36.429 --> 25:38.663
And so the people in Uganda

25:38.698 --> 25:41.099
or in Indonesia or
China who do surveillance

25:41.134 --> 25:43.267
can be on the lookout for the mutations

25:43.302 --> 25:45.169
and the biological traits

25:45.204 --> 25:47.171
associated with increased risk.

25:47.206 --> 25:48.640
What you're doing in the lab

25:48.675 --> 25:51.075
is happening in nature all the time.

25:51.111 --> 25:54.545
Absolutely. Flu pandemics
happen every 20, 30 years

25:54.580 --> 25:56.913
without any involvement of scientists...

25:56.949 --> 25:59.049
mad scientists or good scientists.

25:59.084 --> 26:01.652
What we did in the lab
was nothing different

26:01.687 --> 26:03.320
from what is happening

26:03.356 --> 26:05.889
in animals around the globe every day.

26:08.961 --> 26:10.427
When an animal virus mutates

26:10.463 --> 26:12.263
and spreads into the human population,

26:12.298 --> 26:14.965
it inevitably causes chaos and panic.

26:17.803 --> 26:21.372
As the Ebola crisis spiraled
out of control in 2014,

26:21.407 --> 26:25.709
the US government spent
$2.4 billion in response,

26:25.744 --> 26:29.245
more than a quarter of the US's
entire annual global health budget,

26:29.281 --> 26:32.014
pushing scientists like Dr. Brilliant

26:32.050 --> 26:35.017
to find more preemptive
solutions for future outbreaks.

26:35.053 --> 26:37.187
We have to strengthen public health

26:37.222 --> 26:40.190
in the poorest countries
to make ourselves safe.

26:40.225 --> 26:43.226
Human beings are only as strong

26:43.261 --> 26:47.096
as our weakest surveillance system.

26:47.131 --> 26:50.166
This is one instance
where "America first"

26:50.202 --> 26:53.236
means working with the
poorest countries of the world

26:53.271 --> 26:55.805
to protect them out of selfishness,

26:55.840 --> 26:58.241
our own enlightened self-interest.

27:00.477 --> 27:03.746
Uganda is now at the forefront
of deadly disease monitoring,

27:03.781 --> 27:06.882
with a remarkably effective
bio-surveillance system

27:06.918 --> 27:10.252
that was implemented with the
help of American health agencies

27:10.287 --> 27:11.587
and the US Army.

27:11.622 --> 27:14.356
These motorcycle guys, there's
a whole network of them.

27:14.391 --> 27:16.525
They ride around, they
pick up blood samples,

27:16.560 --> 27:19.661
and they take it from the local
clinics to the bigger hospitals.

27:19.697 --> 27:21.764
It was originally set up to deal with

27:21.799 --> 27:23.398
the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

27:23.434 --> 27:26.301
And then they had the very smart idea

27:26.337 --> 27:29.205
to piggyback the examination

27:29.240 --> 27:32.074
of the blood samples
for other infections

27:32.110 --> 27:35.110
like Ebola, SARS, yellow fever.

27:35.145 --> 27:38.479
It's very lo-fi and
rudimentary and cheap,

27:38.514 --> 27:39.848
but it's working.

27:49.993 --> 27:51.359
In 2007,

27:51.394 --> 27:55.463
146 people were infected by a
small Ebola outbreak in Uganda.

27:55.498 --> 27:58.566
Since then, three
outbreaks have emerged here,

27:58.601 --> 28:01.803
but this bio-surveillance
system helped prevent each one

28:01.838 --> 28:05.406
from spreading beyond 25 infections.

28:05.441 --> 28:07.541
It's not just surveillance of humans,

28:07.577 --> 28:09.677
it's surveillance of animals

28:09.712 --> 28:12.613
who could carry a virus
that we don't know about

28:12.649 --> 28:15.182
but has potential for human disease.

28:16.319 --> 28:18.952
We sample from poultry and swine,

28:18.988 --> 28:20.688
for rapid virus detection,

28:20.723 --> 28:22.890
so that immediately, we
are able to detect it,

28:22.925 --> 28:26.193
before it spreads out
massively to other areas.

28:26.228 --> 28:30.498
If we have good pandemic preparation,

28:30.533 --> 28:32.433
if we find outbreaks quickly,

28:32.468 --> 28:35.235
we won't have that
pandemic. It's our option.

28:36.306 --> 28:38.172
Outbreaks are inevitable,

28:38.207 --> 28:40.841
pandemics are optional.
