[woman reading] "She squared off
<i>mano-a-mano</i> with Petrov

01:50.277 --> 01:52.487
to finalize the bailout deal.

01:52.570 --> 01:54.657
Meanwhile, Secretary Durant
twiddled her thumbs,

01:54.740 --> 01:57.117
waiting without a seat
at the bargaining table."

01:57.200 --> 01:58.994
- [Seth sighs]
- Pretty wild, huh?

02:00.495 --> 02:02.748
- When was that posted?
- 3:00 a.m.

02:07.502 --> 02:09.045
[Seth] You should go.

02:10.881 --> 02:12.507
[chuckles softly]

02:12.590 --> 02:15.343
- No breakfast, even?
- I have work to do.

02:15.427 --> 02:17.595
Welcome back. It's a dramatic day.
Let's see where things stand.

02:17.680 --> 02:19.056
And, Wolf, you can see the big change.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.433
Catherine Durant now on
our presidential nominating wall.

02:21.516 --> 02:23.811
She has shifted
from vice presidential hopeful

02:23.894 --> 02:25.437
to potential presidential candidate.

02:25.520 --> 02:28.190
And a Durant candidacy
might be appealing to Democrats

02:28.273 --> 02:31.694
who aren't enthusiastic
about either Underwood or Dunbar.

02:31.777 --> 02:34.571
And imagine this scenario if we
play this out through this convention.

02:34.655 --> 02:37.825
Heather Dunbar came out of the primaries,
of course, with 46%.

02:37.908 --> 02:39.326
It's not enough to win the nomination,

02:39.409 --> 02:42.830
but for him to win, President Underwood,
he still needs these superdelegates.

02:42.913 --> 02:45.123
He won the popular vote
when Dunbar withdrew,

02:45.207 --> 02:47.960
but you're saying
he doesn't have a technical majority.

02:48.043 --> 02:50.587
[King] 659 superdelegates yet to weigh in,

02:50.670 --> 02:52.965
so you see Frank Underwood
drops down to 48%.

02:53.048 --> 02:55.675
He's still in the lead,
but not enough to clinch the nomination.

02:55.759 --> 02:58.386
And you want a little bit more intrigue,
like we need that?

02:58.470 --> 03:01.223
Twenty-four states, Wolf,
these 24 states highlighted,

03:01.306 --> 03:04.226
they do not have so-called
faithless delegate laws,

03:04.309 --> 03:08.688
meaning in these 24 states,
the delegates don't have to,

03:08.772 --> 03:11.066
they are not legally bound
to vote for the candidate

03:11.149 --> 03:12.776
who won their state's primary or caucus.

03:12.860 --> 03:15.570
- They can vote for whoever they want.
- They could vote for Heather Dunbar.

03:15.653 --> 03:17.072
They could switch over
and vote for Catherine Durant.

03:17.155 --> 03:19.282
Wolf, if they want,
they could vote for you.

03:19.366 --> 03:20.617
They're not gonna vote for me.

03:20.700 --> 03:23.245
But if Secretary Durant
siphons off enough votes

03:23.328 --> 03:26.206
or Underwood doesn't get that majority
in the first ballot,

03:26.289 --> 03:27.665
what, all bets are off?

03:27.750 --> 03:29.626
I think about the only sure bet today is

03:29.709 --> 03:33.130
President Underwood must be wishing
he hadn't agreed to this open convention.

03:33.213 --> 03:36.466
<i>Does Durant or Dunbar really
have a shot at winning this thing?</i>

03:36.549 --> 03:38.844
<i>Sure. You've got a president
who wasn't elected to begin with.</i>

03:38.927 --> 03:41.054
<i>His health is a giant
question mark right now.</i>

03:41.138 --> 03:43.223
<i>He's had a rocky tenure,
plus you've got an open convention.</i>

03:43.306 --> 03:44.933
<i>Anything could happen.</i>

03:45.017 --> 03:46.977
[Blitzer] <i>Like giving,</i>
<i>uh, Durant a run for her money.</i>

03:47.060 --> 03:50.355
<i>Uh,</i> Slugline, <i>by the way, picked up</i>
<i>the</i> Politico <i>story from yesterday.</i>

03:50.438 --> 03:51.982
<i>It could get traction
out there on the floor.</i>

03:52.065 --> 03:54.192
[King] <i>That's true,</i>
<i>and, again, at an open convention,</i>

03:54.276 --> 03:57.195
<i>Claire Underwood may
suddenly be the dark horse here.</i>

04:00.949 --> 04:02.868
[vehicle approaching]

04:05.829 --> 04:07.580
[vehicle doors open and close]

04:07.664 --> 04:11.168
[front door opens and closes]

04:21.636 --> 04:23.430
Mother.

04:25.473 --> 04:27.768
Hello, Claire.
[wheezes]

04:29.812 --> 04:31.688
[sighs]

04:32.856 --> 04:34.942
Why'd you move down here?

04:36.234 --> 04:40.738
Hospice lady said I shouldn't be
going up and down stairs anymore.

04:41.698 --> 04:44.868
Besides, I like it.
More light.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.622
Who's that?

04:49.706 --> 04:52.209
Uh, Tom, would you
give us a minute, please?

04:52.292 --> 04:53.376
Sorry.

04:53.460 --> 04:56.129
No, no. Come here, young man.

04:57.505 --> 04:59.716
[Yates] Hi, Mrs. Hale.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.384
My name's Tom.

05:02.302 --> 05:05.138
It's Thomas Yates, the novelist.
You've probably heard of him.

05:06.181 --> 05:11.895
Mmm, I think everything since
John Cheever isn't worth readin'.

05:11.979 --> 05:15.816
- [chuckles] You're probably right.
- [chuckles]

05:18.276 --> 05:22.447
Well, Claire... did you come to take stock

05:22.530 --> 05:26.368
of everything you're gonna
inherit when I die?

05:28.661 --> 05:31.081
Hmm. Well, it's convenient, isn't it,

05:31.164 --> 05:35.252
having a dying mother when you need
an excuse to skip town?

05:35.335 --> 05:36.879
[Elizabeth chuckles]

05:39.923 --> 05:41.716
We won't disturb you.

05:43.385 --> 05:45.678
It was nice meeting you, Mrs. Hale.

05:45.762 --> 05:50.350
- Elizabeth.
- All right. Well, then you call me Tom.

05:50.433 --> 05:51.518
I hate "Thomas."

05:52.769 --> 05:56.899
- Fair enough, Tom.
- [Yates] We have a deal.

06:01.653 --> 06:04.322
We want a unified party,
not a fractured one.

06:04.406 --> 06:06.699
I can't play fast
and loose with the rules.

06:06.783 --> 06:09.119
This is an open convention.
There are no rules.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.788
I already gave Senator Sheer
that prime-time spot that you wanted.

06:11.871 --> 06:13.873
But this, as chair of the convention--

06:13.957 --> 06:18.253
And I made you chair of this convention
precisely for moments like this.

06:18.336 --> 06:20.630
I have an obligation
to not play favorites.

06:20.713 --> 06:23.883
Your obligation to the party is
an obligation to the leader of the party,

06:23.967 --> 06:26.011
and as the president, that would be me.

06:26.094 --> 06:27.095
- Correct?
- Yes, sir, but--

06:27.179 --> 06:30.807
Then this isn't about favoritism.
It's about solidarity.

06:30.890 --> 06:34.561
We've got a car waiting to take you
to the convention hall, Ms. Whittaker.

06:39.357 --> 06:40.525
[door closes]

06:41.609 --> 06:44.947
- [indistinct chatter]
- I call this convention to order.

06:45.030 --> 06:50.618
Of the Democratic National Committee
and the convention chair, Patti Whittaker.

06:50.702 --> 06:52.787
[crowd cheering]

06:54.872 --> 06:56.499
Good morning.

06:58.710 --> 07:02.047
I was just informed that
the president will travel to Washington

07:02.130 --> 07:04.341
to meet with his national security team.

07:04.424 --> 07:08.220
Given that key contenders
for both slots on the ticket

07:08.303 --> 07:14.892
aren't able to be on the floor today,
the Rules Committee has advised that

07:14.977 --> 07:19.814
we should wait for their return
before any further votes are held.

07:19.897 --> 07:23.151
[crowd murmuring]

07:23.235 --> 07:27.280
There is a motion to postpone all votes

07:27.364 --> 07:30.242
- until the president's return.
- [murmuring continues]

07:30.325 --> 07:34.287
ICO began its advance
from As Suwar late last night,

07:34.371 --> 07:36.456
and by our calculations
and their current pace,

07:36.539 --> 07:39.584
we expect them to reach the Euphrates
within 72 hours.

07:39.667 --> 07:42.337
Now, this could disrupt
highway and river traffic,

07:42.420 --> 07:43.713
but more importantly,

07:43.796 --> 07:48.426
could give them the opportunity to destroy
vital dams in the region.

07:48.510 --> 07:51.138
And as a result,
I am heading to Washington right now

07:51.221 --> 07:54.557
so that we can decide exactly
how we should stop this ICO advance.

07:54.641 --> 07:57.144
[all clamoring]

07:57.644 --> 07:59.229
Is this sudden change of plans

07:59.312 --> 08:01.189
a result of your meeting
with Governor Conway yesterday?

08:01.273 --> 08:05.610
[chuckles] Well, it wouldn't surprise me
if ICO accelerated their plans,

08:05.693 --> 08:07.279
uh, because of the governor's comments.

08:07.362 --> 08:10.198
They certainly know
how to take advantage of media attention.

08:10.282 --> 08:11.866
But whether that's the truth or not,

08:11.949 --> 08:14.411
this is an imminent threat
which we must deal with immediately.

08:14.494 --> 08:15.912
I'm glad the president heard me

08:15.996 --> 08:18.706
and finally took
General Brockhart's advice to heart.

08:18.790 --> 08:21.626
Now we'll just have to wait and see
if it actually results in anything.

08:21.709 --> 08:24.796
I just hope it's not too little, too late.

08:24.879 --> 08:26.923
What are your plans now, Governor?
Remain in Atlanta?

08:27.007 --> 08:28.675
No, Hannah and I are
heading back on the trail.

08:28.758 --> 08:31.428
We accomplished
what we needed to here in Georgia,

08:31.511 --> 08:34.056
and we're heading off
to Arizona today and then Utah.

08:34.139 --> 08:35.515
[all clamoring]
Mr. President. Mr. President.

08:35.597 --> 08:37.017
Why Washington and not here?

08:37.100 --> 08:40.312
This issue is too sensitive
for a mobile White House.

08:40.395 --> 08:41.938
I need to be in the Situation Room

08:42.022 --> 08:44.941
with my entire staff
and team of advisors around me.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.152
[all clamoring]

08:47.235 --> 08:48.403
Yes, Adam.

08:48.486 --> 08:51.364
Mr. President, is this a way
to silence Secretary Durant

08:51.448 --> 08:54.117
after Louisiana put her
in the running for president?

08:54.201 --> 08:57.454
I don't use national security matters
for political purposes.

08:57.537 --> 08:58.663
You know that, Adam.

08:58.746 --> 09:00.998
You have any other further questions,
please direct them to Seth.

09:01.083 --> 09:02.125
Thank you all very much.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.710
[all clamoring]

09:04.461 --> 09:06.296
- You want me to come with?
- No, you stay behind.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.048
- Keep everything under control.
- Yes, sir.

09:08.131 --> 09:10.092
[woman] There are reports
that she's left Atlanta.

09:10.175 --> 09:11.593
<i>The First Lady left earlier this morning.</i>

09:11.676 --> 09:14.721
<i>Her mother's health has deteriorated
in the past few days.</i>

09:14.804 --> 09:17.057
- [reporters clamoring] <i>Seth!</i>
<i>- Adam.</i>

09:17.140 --> 09:19.267
[Gould] <i>Does this mean</i>
<i>she's out of the running for VP?</i>

09:19.351 --> 09:21.644
- [Elizabeth chuckles]
<i>- The First Lady was never in the running.</i>

09:21.728 --> 09:24.522
<i>She and the president continue
to support Catherine Durant--</i>

09:24.606 --> 09:27.275
[Elizabeth and Yates laughing]

09:32.530 --> 09:35.575
Father of four, sailor...

09:35.658 --> 09:38.411
staph infection
from stepping on a rusty fish hook.

09:38.495 --> 09:39.912
- [chuckles] Heavens!
- [chuckles]

09:39.996 --> 09:43.040
And this one, yeah, you were a fruit fly.

09:43.125 --> 09:45.377
- [chuckles] A fruit fly.
- [chuckles] Yes.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.462
Oh. Oh, oh...

09:47.545 --> 09:51.383
You were a consort to Rasputin
and his 14-inch...

09:51.466 --> 09:53.801
[giggling] No, don't say it.

09:53.885 --> 09:55.803
I don't have to say it
because you're already imagining it.

09:55.887 --> 09:57.180
- [laughs]
- [chuckling]

10:01.393 --> 10:03.520
[Claire] I looked it over.

10:05.021 --> 10:06.606
I'll meet you outside.

10:17.242 --> 10:22.997
Uh, gonna leave all this to Vi
and the girls if you're not interested.

10:25.125 --> 10:28.336
- Grandmother's jewelry?
- Mmm-hmm.

10:28.420 --> 10:32.924
She'd turn over in her grave
if I didn't at least offer it to you.

10:34.091 --> 10:38.346
- She had great taste.
- Hmm. Where do you think I got it from?

10:38.430 --> 10:40.557
[chuckles]

10:41.849 --> 10:43.059
[Claire] What's this?

10:44.769 --> 10:46.563
[smacks lips]

10:46.646 --> 10:49.691
Look at it. Open it up.

10:53.069 --> 10:57.657
Must be worth somethin',
baby teeth of the First Lady.

10:59.451 --> 11:02.370
- [sighs]
- I like that boy.

11:03.288 --> 11:05.415
Makes me laugh.

11:06.291 --> 11:08.251
Like your father used to.

11:08.335 --> 11:12.255
Can't imagine Daddy dressed up
as a fortune teller.

11:12.339 --> 11:17.051
Oh, you'd be surprised.
He had a silly side to him.

11:17.134 --> 11:19.053
Not that I ever saw.

11:20.763 --> 11:26.478
Well, there were certain things
that he only did with me.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.898
[coughing]

11:31.899 --> 11:33.109
Oh.

11:33.192 --> 11:36.613
Oh, you see,
laughter is good for the pain.

11:36.696 --> 11:40.367
Even better than this morphine. [wheezes]

11:40.450 --> 11:43.119
- Let me help you.
- No, no, I can do it.

11:43.202 --> 11:44.829
You just go.

11:47.457 --> 11:49.208
Go!

12:07.477 --> 12:09.729
You crossed everything out.

12:11.314 --> 12:14.442
- [Claire] It wasn't good.
- I know.

12:18.613 --> 12:20.573
[sighs]

12:20.657 --> 12:23.993
Is that what you're gonna do here,
after she dies?

12:25.537 --> 12:28.581
Cross everything out...
because it wasn't good?

12:34.128 --> 12:36.130
You're not going to get me
to talk about my mother.

12:40.217 --> 12:42.345
I hope not.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.221
Hatred's ugly.

12:44.306 --> 12:46.558
It's too beautiful a day for that.

12:48.393 --> 12:50.061
Back to the salt mines.

13:00.863 --> 13:02.449
Please, sit.

13:02.532 --> 13:04.784
Sir, these are the current ICO positions.

13:04.867 --> 13:07.912
We're still drafting action items,
but we can give you a rough sense--

13:07.995 --> 13:10.332
Well, before we discuss
any military options,

13:10.415 --> 13:13.418
I'd like to put a call in to Damascus
and see what they'll allow.

13:13.501 --> 13:16.295
Madam Secretary, won't you join me?

13:22.969 --> 13:26.723
So you had to call a national security
meeting just to get us in the same room?

13:26.806 --> 13:29.266
And to keep you off the phone with Conway.

13:29.351 --> 13:32.228
All I needed was one call to him.
I don't need to make another.

13:32.311 --> 13:35.815
You don't actually think he's gonna
make you Secretary of State, do you?

13:35.898 --> 13:37.859
Probably not,
but I would've paid good money

13:37.942 --> 13:40.487
- just to see your face when he told you.
- Mmm.

13:40.570 --> 13:43.573
I never promised you the ticket.
I promised you I'd try.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.575
You pretended to try.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.660
Claire's support
didn't just happen on its own,

13:47.744 --> 13:53.124
and you had the gall to take my hand,
look me in the eye and lie to my face.

13:53.207 --> 13:55.960
- You're mistaken, Cathy.
- Oh, come on, Frank.

13:56.043 --> 14:00.339
I've had a front row seat to everything
since the day Walker took office,

14:00.423 --> 14:03.635
all the lies and betrayals,
and I helped you.

14:03.718 --> 14:06.638
My mistake was I assumed
you wouldn't stab me in the back.

14:06.721 --> 14:10.016
Your mistake is that it backfired.

14:11.768 --> 14:13.603
This is all personal, isn't it?

14:13.686 --> 14:17.440
This is about how Claire treated you
when I was in the hospital.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.901
Give me more credit than that.
This is business.

14:19.984 --> 14:22.570
We were partners.
You broke the contract.

14:22.654 --> 14:26.157
- So, what do you want?
- What else is there, Frank?

14:27.074 --> 14:28.242
Nothing.

14:29.911 --> 14:33.831
It's simple.
Either Claire's votes come my way...

14:33.915 --> 14:36.167
or I turn the convention upside down.

14:38.044 --> 14:41.088
- [breathes deeply]
- [LeAnn] <i>We need to talk about Seth.</i>

14:41.172 --> 14:43.800
I've been getting calls
from former clients.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.844
Now, before you say anything,
here's the dirt.

14:46.928 --> 14:49.263
I cheated on a math test in 8th grade,

14:49.346 --> 14:51.933
I shoplifted a homecoming dress
when I was 16,

14:52.016 --> 14:54.477
I experimented with a sorority sister
in freshman year,

14:54.561 --> 14:56.771
and I was late on my taxes in 2007.

14:56.854 --> 15:01.443
What he won't find
is anything that justifies firing me.

15:01.526 --> 15:04.487
I'm sure he was just vetting you.
We do that with everyone.

15:04.571 --> 15:07.615
[scoffs] Okay,
if that's your story, then fine,

15:07.699 --> 15:09.742
but all I care about
is winning this election.

15:09.826 --> 15:13.079
So let's get past our personal shit
and be a team, okay?

15:18.125 --> 15:20.336
We're fighting a common
enemy here, Mr. President.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.129
It's important that we remain united.

15:22.213 --> 15:25.675
Yeah, and I can assure you
that Secretary Durant will reach out

15:25.758 --> 15:29.011
before we conduct any operation.
Thank you for your time, Mr. President.

15:29.095 --> 15:31.681
We'll be in touch as soon
as we come up with a plan.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.183
You're acting like
I'll still be Secretary of State.

15:34.266 --> 15:36.478
Well, if you play your cards right,
you will be.

15:36.561 --> 15:38.896
Who else did you offer the VP slot to?

15:38.980 --> 15:40.982
There's Jackie, Austen, me.
Anyone else?

15:41.065 --> 15:43.317
Austen withdrew on his own,
and so did Jackie.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.111
I did not push her out.

15:45.194 --> 15:48.990
Jackie says you took her for granted,
that you bullied her, you intimidated her.

15:49.073 --> 15:51.743
And that is what
she is telling every member

15:51.826 --> 15:55.455
of the California delegation,
one phone call at a time.

15:55.538 --> 15:58.791
California.
Lots of votes.

15:58.875 --> 16:01.461
California, the largest piece of delegates
at the Democratic Convention.

16:01.544 --> 16:04.464
I'm told that delegation is trending
toward Heather Dunbar.

16:04.547 --> 16:05.548
Let's watch this, Wolf.

16:05.632 --> 16:08.760
Let's imagine she only picked up
two-thirds of the California delegates.

16:08.843 --> 16:10.177
That gets you above 300 there.

16:10.261 --> 16:12.805
Plus, we assume she'll keep
her home state Connecticut's support.

16:12.889 --> 16:14.140
Off to a pretty good start.

16:14.223 --> 16:17.393
It's over 300 delegates.
What, roughly, uh, 7% of the vote?

16:17.477 --> 16:19.562
That alone could take this,
what, to a second ballot?

16:19.646 --> 16:22.064
That takes it to a second ballot,
an open convention again.

16:22.148 --> 16:25.818
Plus, we also assume that
Louisiana will stay with Catherine Durant.

16:25.902 --> 16:27.945
<i>So, we are not going to have
a definitive idea</i>

16:28.029 --> 16:29.363
<i>of how all this is gonna shape up</i>

16:29.446 --> 16:31.282
<i>at least until they conduct
the first ballot.</i>

16:31.365 --> 16:32.867
<i>There's still no update as to, uh,</i>

16:32.950 --> 16:36.037
<i>when the president
and Secretary Durant will return.</i>

16:36.120 --> 16:37.747
[King] <i>No, and that adds to some</i>
<i>of the uncertainty here.</i>

16:37.830 --> 16:39.874
<i>So let's go back to the floor,
see how things are playing out.</i>

16:39.957 --> 16:44.045
It didn't specify in the article
which direction the motorcade was heading.

16:46.923 --> 16:48.132
East.

16:50.635 --> 16:51.844
You're sure?

16:53.638 --> 16:55.139
Thank you very much.

16:58.935 --> 17:00.687
[typing]

17:18.621 --> 17:20.080
Hot damn!

17:21.207 --> 17:24.752
I am promising you Secretary of State
for as long as you want it

17:24.836 --> 17:28.505
and my full support
when you run for president in 2024.

17:28.590 --> 17:30.216
I mean, who knows,
you might even get lucky.

17:30.299 --> 17:32.009
My liver might fail before then.

17:32.093 --> 17:35.638
Your promises stopped meaning much
after you promised Baker my job.

17:35.722 --> 17:38.474
I have no intention of offering him
Secretary of State.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.768
Oh, so you lied to him
the way Walker lied to you.

17:40.852 --> 17:46.023
No. Walker and I didn't have a history.
And Walker didn't respect me.

17:46.107 --> 17:49.777
You and I have a history, Cathy,
and I respect you immensely.

17:49.861 --> 17:52.446
But our history goes back three years.

17:52.529 --> 17:57.159
Claire's and my partnership goes back 30.
You have to respect that.

17:57.243 --> 18:01.538
I might have... if you had been honest
with me from the beginning.

18:01.623 --> 18:04.876
Well, I wish I could turn back time,
but here we are.

18:04.959 --> 18:07.294
And you can keep me out of Atlanta
for as long as you want,

18:07.378 --> 18:09.756
but you can't hold the vote back forever.

18:09.839 --> 18:13.676
Time's moving forward, not back.
And time is on my side.

18:18.973 --> 18:21.893
If Heather Dunbar wants to take advantage
of the president's absence,

18:21.976 --> 18:23.144
that's her prerogative.

18:23.227 --> 18:25.562
But she's still in D.C.,
there's no public statement.

18:25.647 --> 18:27.732
You see that as taking advantage?

18:27.815 --> 18:30.610
You think Congresswoman Sharp
would make calls on her behalf

18:30.693 --> 18:32.569
if she wasn't pulling the strings
from Washington?

18:32.654 --> 18:34.864
[Gould] Sharp says
she's doing it on her own.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.949
You don't have any proof of coordination.

18:37.033 --> 18:40.870
You're right, I don't.
Just human nature, basic logic,

18:40.953 --> 18:43.623
and a slightly better than average
understanding of political gamesmanship.

18:43.706 --> 18:44.916
[all chuckle]

18:44.999 --> 18:48.961
Uh, if you will excuse me,
even press secretaries have to pee.

18:49.045 --> 18:50.046
- I'll just be right back.
- Okay.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.048
[Seth] Excuse me.
Excuse me. I'm sorry. Excuse me.

18:56.844 --> 18:58.012
What's up?

18:59.221 --> 19:01.724
LeAnn knows, and I think you told her.

19:01.808 --> 19:04.686
I did. Straight up.
I told her everything.

19:04.769 --> 19:07.689
- Let's go. Upstairs.
- No.

19:08.815 --> 19:11.192
- Excuse me?
- You've got Dunbar in play,

19:11.275 --> 19:14.445
you got Durant with the president,
and the First Lady's in Dallas.

19:14.528 --> 19:15.738
And I've got a room full of press

19:15.822 --> 19:17.323
that I've been keeping at bay
since 8:00 this morning,

19:17.406 --> 19:22.286
so I will tell you why I told her...
after I tuck in all the children.

19:25.247 --> 19:27.083
[reporters clamoring]

19:33.965 --> 19:36.300
[breathing heavily]

19:39.887 --> 19:41.097
[grunting]

19:43.265 --> 19:45.309
[breathing heavily]

19:48.020 --> 19:50.481
[grunts and exclaims]

19:50.564 --> 19:55.527
- [chanting] Let's vote now!
- [gavel banging]

19:56.988 --> 19:59.531
- Order, please!
- [gavel banging]

19:59.615 --> 20:02.702
- [chanting continues]
- It is Senator Sheer's time to speak.

20:03.828 --> 20:04.871
Order!

20:05.872 --> 20:08.165
Maybe we should let Cathy have her way.

20:09.083 --> 20:12.544
If the vote's held now, you two win.
We focus on the general.

20:14.005 --> 20:16.132
[Frank] What's brought all this on?

20:16.215 --> 20:17.424
[Elizabeth and nurse conversing
indistinctly]

20:17.508 --> 20:21.846
I just wonder if we're in over our heads,
Francis, trying to do this.

20:21.929 --> 20:23.264
<i>Is it your mother?</i>

20:24.015 --> 20:26.267
I'm sure it's difficult
to see her this sick.

20:29.812 --> 20:31.731
She's completely helpless.

20:31.814 --> 20:34.776
<i>But we're not helpless.
We can turn this around.</i>

20:37.779 --> 20:39.363
I guess I'm just...

20:41.073 --> 20:44.869
I don't know, maybe...
maybe we're making a mistake.

20:44.952 --> 20:47.246
Maybe I'm not ready
to be your running mate.

20:47.329 --> 20:51.583
<i>- Conway has a four-star general.</i>
- Is she happy, your mother?

20:52.752 --> 20:54.295
<i>No, she's miserable.</i>

20:55.046 --> 20:57.589
Tom makes her laugh, but mostly, no.

21:00.301 --> 21:02.011
Imagine my liver's failing.

21:02.094 --> 21:04.263
<i>- Imagine I'm dying.</i>
- Francis...

21:04.346 --> 21:07.349
<i>No, I just want you
to picture it for just a moment.</i>

21:07.433 --> 21:11.228
There I am, lying in a bed
just like your mother is now.

21:12.396 --> 21:14.774
The only thing that would make me happy

21:14.857 --> 21:17.777
is to know that you would
take over after I passed.

21:18.820 --> 21:20.822
<i>If it were Cathy...</i>

21:20.905 --> 21:23.532
<i>I'd be just as miserable
as your mother is.</i>

21:25.201 --> 21:26.869
<i>I'll do my part.</i>

21:28.454 --> 21:30.747
You just concentrate on that speech.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.836
All right.
Thank you, Francis.

21:34.919 --> 21:35.962
<i>Good night.</i>

21:36.879 --> 21:41.300
- She, uh... she won't eat?
- [sighs] It's hard for her to swallow.

21:42.593 --> 21:45.762
How much time do you think she has?

21:46.638 --> 21:52.061
I can't be definitive, but...
a couple of weeks, maybe.

21:52.144 --> 21:55.356
If she stops eating altogether,
it could be days.

21:56.357 --> 21:58.025
She's in a lot of pain.

22:00.319 --> 22:01.863
She doesn't have to be.

22:01.946 --> 22:05.366
When it gets to this point,
we can make her comfortable.

22:07.493 --> 22:10.997
Comfortable enough
that the body will let go.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.129
Does she want that?

22:20.589 --> 22:23.467
That is something you should
discuss with your mother.

22:27.763 --> 22:29.306
I like the plants.

22:30.933 --> 22:32.518
The plants you put in there.

22:35.729 --> 22:38.690
It's the little things, right?

22:40.609 --> 22:43.737
If we take out the refineries,
that would eliminate their revenue stream.

22:43.820 --> 22:46.115
They can't advance
if they don't have the resources.

22:46.198 --> 22:50.244
President Makhzun made it very clear
he wants those to remain intact.

22:50.327 --> 22:52.788
It's our best option
from a strategic point of view.

22:52.871 --> 22:55.291
Minimal loss of life,
maximal impact on capability.

22:55.374 --> 22:58.127
It's either total war or nothing at all.

23:00.129 --> 23:02.673
Well, that doesn't sound
very diplomatic, Cathy.

23:02.756 --> 23:04.841
We're going to be
diplomatic with terrorists?

23:04.926 --> 23:07.053
I made a promise to President Makhzun.

23:07.136 --> 23:09.931
You've broken promises before.
Why should this be any different?

23:12.808 --> 23:15.394
Why don't we break for dinner?
We'll pick this up afterwards.

23:15.477 --> 23:17.021
I wanna review this a bit more.

23:17.104 --> 23:18.605
I'll have some food brought
into the Roosevelt Room.

23:18.689 --> 23:19.982
Thank you all very much.

23:23.819 --> 23:26.697
Cathy, why don't you and I eat in here?

23:40.169 --> 23:41.587
[door closes]

23:42.713 --> 23:45.424
"Total war or nothing at all"?

23:46.342 --> 23:48.469
The moment I get in front of those cameras

23:48.552 --> 23:52.098
and I tell them that Conway is right
and Brockhart is right,

23:52.181 --> 23:55.601
and that you completely
bungled the ICO situation,

23:55.684 --> 23:57.769
how do you think Dunbar will do then?

24:02.984 --> 24:05.569
Can we get two Cobb salads
in here, please?

24:06.528 --> 24:09.823
- I don't like Cobb salad.
- Then you don't have to eat it.

24:14.996 --> 24:16.288
[Tom] Thanks for coming over.

24:16.372 --> 24:18.249
[Dunbar] Way easier coming here
than you coming there.

24:18.332 --> 24:20.667
Must be ten news crews
outside of my house.

24:20.751 --> 24:22.086
[chuckles] How'd you escape?

24:22.169 --> 24:23.879
The old-fashioned way.
Back door.

24:23.962 --> 24:26.048
- Hmm.
- How did you get my home phone?

24:26.132 --> 24:27.466
Oh, old-fashioned way.

24:27.549 --> 24:29.260
- Rolodex from the <i>Herald.</i>
- Ah.

24:30.177 --> 24:31.637
Come with me.
[stutters] I won't keep you long.

24:31.720 --> 24:32.846
[Dunbar] Yeah.

24:33.472 --> 24:36.767
- [Dunbar] How long did this take you?
- Couple of months.

24:36.850 --> 24:38.102
I've been working on my own.

24:38.185 --> 24:40.354
We had a whole team
and we didn't find this.

24:40.437 --> 24:43.440
Well, you probably weren't digging
as deep as the <i>Bates City Vine.</i>

24:43.524 --> 24:45.442
[scoffs] No.

24:46.402 --> 24:48.195
We spent most of our energy
tracking the money.

24:48.279 --> 24:50.947
We should've been more
focused on the travel logs.

24:51.032 --> 24:53.617
I wouldn't have checked either
until I spoke with a pizza guy.

24:53.700 --> 24:55.577
Then I realized they might be
manipulating the logs.

24:55.661 --> 24:57.371
Which gets you to Lanagin.

24:57.454 --> 24:59.706
It still doesn't prove
he met with Lanagin,

24:59.790 --> 25:01.875
but I don't know where else
that motorcade would've been heading.

25:02.501 --> 25:03.710
Are you going public with this?

25:03.794 --> 25:07.548
[inhales deeply] I could,
but he has some plausible deniability.

25:07.631 --> 25:09.425
He pins it all on Meechum.

25:09.508 --> 25:13.429
If he's covering up travel,
who knows what else he's covering up?

25:13.512 --> 25:14.971
That's the story I want,

25:15.056 --> 25:18.434
not some Secret Service man
being loose with the books.

25:18.517 --> 25:22.271
- So you're still under the radar.
- Mmm-hmm.

25:24.565 --> 25:27.276
I have to ask you
to keep all this to yourself.

25:27.359 --> 25:30.446
I know it can be tempting now that...
you have a chance,

25:30.529 --> 25:34.075
but if this goes public too early,
his guard goes up.

25:34.158 --> 25:37.119
Listen, it was hard when I withdrew.

25:37.203 --> 25:39.913
How the leadership abandoned me,
how the public did.

25:39.996 --> 25:43.834
It took some time...
but I made my peace.

25:43.917 --> 25:48.589
It's a crapshoot whether I can win this.
He can probably fight that off.

25:52.468 --> 25:55.304
You need to write the story
that he can't fight off.

25:58.974 --> 26:02.186
You investigated him.
Where's the weak link?

26:03.937 --> 26:05.856
Remy Danton.

26:17.118 --> 26:18.660
[Elizabeth snores]

26:30.547 --> 26:32.133
[Elizabeth] Tom did that.

26:34.176 --> 26:37.638
It's a shame.
He'd be good for you.

26:41.475 --> 26:43.602
I never believed in the tooth fairy.

26:45.812 --> 26:49.400
- Well, you took the money anyway.
- [chuckles]

26:49.483 --> 26:53.445
Could you turn off that light, please?
Hurts my eyes.

27:01.245 --> 27:04.831
When you were small...
[chuckles] you used to...

27:05.999 --> 27:09.628
used to ask me to make it stop, the dark.

27:09.711 --> 27:10.754
Do you remember?

27:12.839 --> 27:14.007
Yes.

27:14.925 --> 27:18.429
And I promised you I would...
in the morning.

27:18.512 --> 27:19.846
[both chuckle]

27:21.682 --> 27:24.893
But, damn it,
you would sit at that window...

27:26.061 --> 27:28.480
every night...

27:28.564 --> 27:32.025
trying to make the sun rise,
all by yourself.

27:32.943 --> 27:34.320
[sighs]

27:35.612 --> 27:37.698
Your daddy would put you in bed...

27:38.699 --> 27:43.245
after you'd fallen asleep
with your face against the glass.

27:46.164 --> 27:48.209
And I was so jealous.

27:49.793 --> 27:50.919
Of me and Daddy?

27:52.921 --> 27:54.798
That you believed.

27:56.049 --> 28:00.637
You believed you could make the sun rise.

28:05.267 --> 28:07.728
I spoke to her, Mother, the nurse.

28:11.982 --> 28:13.984
I can't do it.

28:14.067 --> 28:17.446
I can't do it, Mother.
I can't do what you want me to do.

28:17.529 --> 28:19.406
[sighs heavily]

28:24.536 --> 28:26.580
[inhales] Claire...

28:28.540 --> 28:31.252
it'd help you win...

28:33.670 --> 28:35.797
having your mother gone.

28:40.719 --> 28:42.263
Do this for me.

28:44.681 --> 28:47.934
And let me be a help to you.

28:48.018 --> 28:50.020
Finally.

28:53.274 --> 28:56.402
[breathing deeply]

29:04.868 --> 29:06.745
[exhales deeply]

29:08.580 --> 29:10.040
[Claire] Tom.

29:13.419 --> 29:15.003
She wants you to be there.

29:19.258 --> 29:20.509
What do you want?

29:25.055 --> 29:26.640
I want you to be there, too.

29:29.351 --> 29:30.352
[softly] Okay.

29:33.439 --> 29:35.566
[breathing heavily]

29:49.371 --> 29:51.206
Okay.

32:13.557 --> 32:15.350
[knocking on door]

32:17.268 --> 32:18.770
[clears throat]

32:27.738 --> 32:30.532
[Seth] I told her because you put me
in an impossible situation.

32:30.616 --> 32:33.702
There's nothing on her,
but you wouldn't listen.

32:34.620 --> 32:36.955
And you must not have listened
when you came over to my house.

32:37.038 --> 32:38.790
I was very clear.

32:40.000 --> 32:43.504
So... you're gonna throw me
on the ground again?

32:44.420 --> 32:46.548
Look, here's a glass.
Let's go ahead.

32:48.133 --> 32:49.300
You wanna fire me?

32:50.927 --> 32:53.388
Fine. It's another resignation.

32:53.472 --> 32:57.684
After Remy, after Brockhart.
With Durant, with Dunbar.

32:57.768 --> 32:59.102
You know, I spin stories for a living.

32:59.185 --> 33:00.771
I can't begin to tell you
how to spin this.

33:04.357 --> 33:07.360
You know, the minibar wasn't open
because you wanted a Diet Coke.

33:09.070 --> 33:12.115
- I'm worried about you, Doug.
- Nobody needs to worry about me.

33:12.198 --> 33:14.200
Yeah, somebody does...

33:14.284 --> 33:17.453
because this scorched-earth policy
is bad for us.

33:17.538 --> 33:21.708
I don't give a rat's ass
about LeAnn Harvey. We need her.

33:21.792 --> 33:24.920
And you need me.
And we both need you.

33:25.003 --> 33:27.338
- At your best.
- I'm fine.

33:27.422 --> 33:30.676
Are you?
Instead of having me do damage control,

33:30.759 --> 33:32.511
you're having me
do damage to one of our own.

33:32.594 --> 33:36.264
- I am trying to protect the president.
- And I'm trying to protect you...

33:36.347 --> 33:38.266
from yourself.

33:38.349 --> 33:42.478
[scoffs] You're so full of shit.
You don't care about me.

33:43.772 --> 33:46.399
After what you did, I should hate you.

33:48.276 --> 33:50.195
But where does it get us?

33:56.451 --> 33:58.662
[typing]

34:00.956 --> 34:02.916
Check out the <i>Telegraph.</i>

34:04.500 --> 34:06.753
The strategy is working...

34:06.837 --> 34:08.504
if you let it.

34:09.590 --> 34:12.551
Or make me resign.
Your call.

34:14.636 --> 34:16.137
[door closes]

35:30.336 --> 35:32.172
[sighs]

35:48.772 --> 35:51.858
- Are you okay?
- [Claire] <i>It's what she wanted.</i>

35:51.942 --> 35:53.151
I was asking you.

35:54.235 --> 35:57.823
Schedule the vote for tomorrow.
I'll fly back to speak just before.

35:57.906 --> 35:59.199
Claire, your mother just passed.

35:59.282 --> 36:02.953
Schedule it, Francis.
Tom wrote a speech. It's good.

36:04.788 --> 36:08.083
- Cathy's not on board yet.
- Then get her on board.

36:09.250 --> 36:11.044
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

36:11.127 --> 36:14.047
<i>- I didn't mean to--</i>
- No, no, it's all right. I'll get it done.

36:14.130 --> 36:16.549
Thank you.
I'll see you tomorrow.

36:16.632 --> 36:18.009
<i>Good night.</i>

36:19.803 --> 36:21.680
Ask Secretary Durant
to meet me in the Oval.

36:21.763 --> 36:22.764
Yes, sir.

36:29.604 --> 36:31.064
Mr. President.

36:33.274 --> 36:34.525
Coffee table.

36:38.947 --> 36:41.491
The funny thing is
I didn't even have to ask him to do it.

36:41.574 --> 36:43.368
He did it on his own.

36:43.451 --> 36:45.536
I especially like where he says,

36:45.620 --> 36:49.958
"Catherine Durant is functional.
Claire Underwood is formidable."

36:56.672 --> 37:00.301
So, you see, you don't even have
time on your side. It's on ours.

37:00.385 --> 37:03.221
By tomorrow morning, there'll be
a dozen articles just like that.

37:03.304 --> 37:04.389
So you have a choice.

37:04.472 --> 37:07.058
You can redeem yourself
as Secretary of State

37:07.142 --> 37:08.684
over the next four years,

37:08.769 --> 37:12.272
or go down in history as a fluke,
who bungled the Middle East

37:12.355 --> 37:14.733
and couldn't even close the deal
in Brandenburg.

37:14.816 --> 37:17.736
You have your version.
I have mine.

37:17.819 --> 37:20.696
I'm sure mine will get
just as much traction as this.

37:20.781 --> 37:23.909
But my version wins
because it's the better story...

37:23.992 --> 37:27.620
and it's also exactly
how things went down.

37:27.703 --> 37:29.956
You see, you don't even have
the truth going for you.

37:31.541 --> 37:33.126
I'm not scared of you.

37:34.753 --> 37:38.965
My endorsement of Dunbar,
that makes for an even better story.

37:42.761 --> 37:45.513
But you wanna know what the best story is?

37:48.850 --> 37:50.894
Claire's mother just died.

37:52.062 --> 37:55.148
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Oh, I don't think you really are,

37:55.231 --> 37:58.484
but that doesn't matter
because the rest of the world will.

37:58.568 --> 38:01.487
And by the time she gives
her speech tomorrow night,

38:01.571 --> 38:05.700
there won't be a dry eye in Atlanta
or across the rest of the country.

38:06.451 --> 38:12.082
So, you get to keep your job, Cathy,
in return for your delegates.

38:12.165 --> 38:13.917
That offer is still on the table.

38:14.000 --> 38:18.296
I have been loyal.
I got you that table.

38:18.379 --> 38:22.050
Do you wanna keep it,
or do you wanna give it to Conway?

38:24.760 --> 38:26.596
[sighs]

38:26.679 --> 38:29.182
[chuckles and inhales deeply]

38:29.265 --> 38:32.018
You know, when I was
waiting for my transplant,

38:32.102 --> 38:35.438
I had the most vivid hallucinations.
You wouldn't believe 'em.

38:35.521 --> 38:37.565
Do you know who I saw?

38:39.150 --> 38:42.946
Peter Russo and Zoe Barnes,
right here in this room.

38:43.029 --> 38:46.282
Zoe was trying to seduce me,
right here on this couch,

38:46.366 --> 38:51.204
and Peter, he shoved my face
up against this glass.

38:52.163 --> 38:55.166
Cigarettes and razor blades and sex.

38:56.084 --> 38:57.793
It was terrifying.

38:59.004 --> 39:00.922
All I wanted to do
was get out of this room

39:01.006 --> 39:02.924
that I worked so hard to get in.

39:05.093 --> 39:07.470
But of course, it makes sense
that they would've haunted me

39:07.553 --> 39:09.764
because it's all true.

39:10.891 --> 39:14.394
- What is?
- Everything Lucas Goodwin claimed.

39:14.477 --> 39:17.147
I killed them both,
just like he said I did.

39:18.857 --> 39:22.903
But of course, nobody believes it,
and nobody ever will.

39:23.819 --> 39:26.197
Because that's how good we are...

39:27.573 --> 39:29.492
at making things...

39:30.743 --> 39:32.120
disappear.

39:37.792 --> 39:39.377
[laughing]

39:42.505 --> 39:45.175
No, we didn't kill anybody.

39:45.258 --> 39:47.802
[laughs]

39:47.886 --> 39:51.639
[sighs] But we would have...

39:51.722 --> 39:53.349
if it was necessary.

39:55.226 --> 39:58.146
So, you're right,
the time for negotiations is over.

39:58.229 --> 40:02.483
You will hand over your delegates,
and you will serve on in my cabinet.

40:02.567 --> 40:05.570
And we will forget
that any of this ever happened.

40:07.697 --> 40:09.532
Because if you don't...

40:12.702 --> 40:14.913
I swear to God...

40:16.581 --> 40:18.374
I will never...

40:19.459 --> 40:23.046
ever forget.

40:26.882 --> 40:29.385
Do you understand now?

40:36.392 --> 40:37.810
Yes.

40:52.408 --> 40:53.493
Good.

40:54.369 --> 40:57.663
Now, let's go decide what we're gonna do
about these terrorists.

40:59.207 --> 41:00.750
[exhales]

41:07.298 --> 41:09.342
[footsteps approaching]

41:35.785 --> 41:37.453
[sighs]

41:41.416 --> 41:45.336
Want me to call someone?
Make arrangements?

42:44.270 --> 42:46.272
[birds chirping]

42:57.700 --> 42:59.619
We made the sun rise.

43:01.787 --> 43:05.333
- She told you that, too?
- Mmm-hmm.

43:36.030 --> 43:37.782
We should get going.

44:24.912 --> 44:26.914
[car engines starting]

44:58.028 --> 45:01.073
Me and Hannah want to extend
our warmest condolences

45:01.156 --> 45:03.117
to the First Lady and the President.

45:03.200 --> 45:07.538
They and all of Elizabeth Hale's
loved ones are in our prayers.

45:07.622 --> 45:10.708
And we won't be campaigning today
out of respect for their loss.

45:10.791 --> 45:13.461
God bless President and Mrs. Underwood.

45:14.629 --> 45:16.422
[Marshall] Got it.

45:16.506 --> 45:18.007
- Put it out.
- [sighs]

45:18.090 --> 45:21.511
Perfect timing... for her to drop dead.

45:21.594 --> 45:23.053
[Conway] We were on a roll, too.

45:42.823 --> 45:44.492
I should prep for the speech.

45:44.575 --> 45:47.495
I have a room set up for you.
I'll be right in.

45:47.578 --> 45:49.455
[Doug] Right this way, Mrs. Underwood.

45:53.376 --> 45:54.669
I read the draft.

45:55.711 --> 45:57.338
And?

45:57.422 --> 46:01.592
- I wouldn't change a thing.
- I'm glad you're pleased.

46:01.676 --> 46:03.093
I'm glad you were with her.

46:03.177 --> 46:06.055
She's strong.
You're a lucky man.

46:07.097 --> 46:08.641
Don't I know it.

46:14.480 --> 46:17.817
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is a great honor to introduce

46:17.900 --> 46:20.486
Secretary of State Catherine Durant.

46:20.570 --> 46:22.488
[crowd cheering]

46:35.710 --> 46:37.044
[whooping]

46:38.879 --> 46:41.882
Thank you, thank you very much.

46:41.966 --> 46:45.845
I know that all of you join me in offering

46:45.928 --> 46:50.641
our sincere condolences
to the First Lady for her loss.

46:53.644 --> 46:59.191
Tonight, I want to offer
my sincere gratitude

46:59.274 --> 47:03.195
to all the delegates
who have honored me with their support

47:03.278 --> 47:05.155
- during the course of this convention.
- [crowd cheering]

47:05.239 --> 47:06.449
Thank you so much.

47:14.415 --> 47:18.628
However, after much deliberation...

47:19.545 --> 47:24.842
I have decided that I have more
to offer you as Secretary of State

47:24.925 --> 47:27.762
than to resign and run for office.

47:27.845 --> 47:29.430
[crowd groaning and murmuring]

47:31.223 --> 47:35.352
But I want to encourage
every one of you who has supported me

47:35.436 --> 47:40.190
to join me in supporting
this extraordinary woman,

47:40.274 --> 47:43.778
the First Lady of the United States,
Claire Hale Underwood.

47:43.861 --> 47:45.946
- [crowd cheering]
- [upbeat music playing]

48:06.426 --> 48:07.968
[music stops]

48:08.052 --> 48:09.429
Thank you.

48:11.681 --> 48:13.015
Thank you.

48:14.684 --> 48:16.436
And good evening.

48:17.520 --> 48:21.857
As all of you know, my mother,
Elizabeth Constance Hale,

48:21.941 --> 48:26.361
passed away last night
after a long illness.

48:28.489 --> 48:31.325
She was a strong woman...

48:31.408 --> 48:33.494
a fierce Texan...

48:37.707 --> 48:44.547
We had... a difficult relationship
from childhood onwards.

48:45.798 --> 48:49.093
At times, there were
long periods of estrangement.

48:50.177 --> 48:55.349
We hurt each other... often and deeply.

48:56.350 --> 48:59.937
If there was one good thing
that came from my mother's illness...

49:01.814 --> 49:07.319
it gave us a chance to reconnect,
to mend old wounds.

49:07.402 --> 49:11.782
And that's not an opportunity
people always get before a parent dies,

49:11.866 --> 49:14.326
and I'm grateful to have had that.

49:17.663 --> 49:19.707
And what am I doing here?

49:23.753 --> 49:28.298
I'm here because my mother
wanted me to be.

49:29.925 --> 49:32.094
Yesterday, before she passed,
she said to me,

49:32.177 --> 49:35.515
"Claire... do this.

49:35.598 --> 49:38.976
If the people want it, listen to them.

49:40.060 --> 49:42.563
And if you lose, then you lose.

49:42.647 --> 49:44.398
But if you win...

49:48.235 --> 49:53.574
be honored, be humbled,
and win this election with Francis!"

49:53.658 --> 49:56.451
[crowd cheering]

50:02.332 --> 50:05.252
And I told her, I said,
"The Conways are tough opponents."

50:05.335 --> 50:08.548
And she said, "They may be tough,
but they're not Texas tough."

50:08.631 --> 50:09.840
[crowd cheers]

50:13.260 --> 50:16.889
Loss is a sobering phenomenon.

50:16.972 --> 50:20.267
Several months ago,
I almost lost my husband.

50:20.350 --> 50:23.563
<i>Our nation almost lost a president.</i>

50:25.189 --> 50:28.984
Loss makes us reevaluate
what we hold dear.

50:30.110 --> 50:35.575
And I'll tell you, there were...
times in the not too distant past,

50:35.658 --> 50:40.204
where Francis and I, we...
almost lost our marriage.

50:41.747 --> 50:44.750
Hard times when we thought
we wouldn't make it.

50:45.751 --> 50:49.463
And like many of you know,
marriage isn't always the smoothest road.

50:50.715 --> 50:54.301
And it took the actions
of a deranged young man

50:54.384 --> 50:58.180
to remind me how important
Francis is to me.

50:59.932 --> 51:03.310
And now, with my mother gone...

51:06.480 --> 51:09.108
he's the only family I have left.
