00:01.126 --> 00:02.787
Previously on 12 Monkeys...

00:02.920 --> 00:04.831
I'm sending you to 2015.

00:04.963 --> 00:08.205
I want you to track down
the patient in room 248.

00:08.342 --> 00:10.128
- What's that?
- Jennifer's file.

00:10.260 --> 00:12.091
She kept saying, "One got away."

00:12.221 --> 00:14.758
What if she was talking
about another scientist?

00:14.890 --> 00:17.302
Tell me
about the Army of the 12 Monkeys.

00:17.434 --> 00:20.096
Goines had a secret lab.
His daughter knows where it is.

00:20.229 --> 00:21.890
They want what's inside.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.387
Cole.

00:23.524 --> 00:24.934
He's got a patient.

00:25.067 --> 00:28.150
JONES: Goines is in the hands
of the Army of the 12 Monkeys.

00:28.278 --> 00:30.394
- Yes.
- JONES: Now we know what to look for.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.487
The Night Room
and the one that got away.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.467
COLE: Easy.

00:58.850 --> 01:00.181
Easy, now.

01:01.853 --> 01:03.309
Do it.

01:05.148 --> 01:06.308
Do it!

01:08.569 --> 01:10.230
You can't hesitate.

01:10.362 --> 01:13.820
You can't hesitate. Every second counts.
lt's you or them. Again.

01:13.949 --> 01:15.814
- Again?
- Yes.

01:15.951 --> 01:19.068
Again and again and again
till we get it right. Now, come on, aim.

01:20.372 --> 01:23.114
You're still holding your breath.
Stop doing that, OK?

01:24.334 --> 01:26.495
All right, now, keep your arm steady.

01:27.963 --> 01:29.248
My dad would be so proud.

01:29.381 --> 01:33.090
Worked three jobs to send
his little lady to medical school.

01:33.218 --> 01:38.212
Now here I am learning how to kill
while waiting for takeout.

01:38.348 --> 01:42.387
Well, if the guy that killed Jeremy
shows up again,

01:42.519 --> 01:44.020
the hard part will be over.

01:44.146 --> 01:46.011
What's that?

01:46.148 --> 01:50.232
Knowing you're pulling the trigger
for the right reason.

01:54.406 --> 01:56.818
(CLICKS)

01:56.950 --> 02:01.865
It's not bad. It's not bad. I think
we're ready to move on to live rounds.

02:03.081 --> 02:04.662
(KNOCKING)

02:12.382 --> 02:13.588
- Hi.
- Here you go.

02:13.717 --> 02:15.582
Thank you.

02:15.719 --> 02:19.507
How long do you think it'll be before
the 12 Monkeys break Jennifer Goines?

02:19.640 --> 02:21.631
I don't know. She won't make it easy.

02:21.767 --> 02:24.179
There's nothing in the future
to help us find her?

02:24.311 --> 02:29.726
- No, we gotta find this other guy.
- The one who got away.

02:34.237 --> 02:38.526
It's our only hope
of finding the plague before they do.

02:38.659 --> 02:41.617
- This is good. What is it?
- General Tso's chicken.

02:43.205 --> 02:45.947
- That guy was a general?
- Yes.

02:46.083 --> 02:49.541
Here in the past,
we have soldiers on the front lines

02:49.670 --> 02:52.332
dedicated to the preparation
and distribution

02:52.464 --> 02:55.171
of both sweet and sour
deep-fried chicken.

02:56.593 --> 02:59.835
- That's not funny.
- (PHONE RINGS)

02:59.971 --> 03:01.802
- That's not funny.
- Hello?

03:04.518 --> 03:07.385
Yes, this is Dr Railly.

03:15.612 --> 03:22.324
You were at JD Peoples last Thursday?
Signed in at 7:26pm?

03:23.495 --> 03:26.987
Yes. I was there
to discharge a former patient.

03:27.124 --> 03:31.743
Yeah, I already saw his transfer papers.
This isn't about your patient.

03:31.878 --> 03:34.494
There was a woman there,
Jennifer Hargrove Goines.

03:34.631 --> 03:37.373
She was illegally removed
from the hospital.

03:38.844 --> 03:42.052
- I saw the man who took her.
- Can you describe him?

03:42.180 --> 03:49.143
Yes. He was tall, scar on the left side
of his cheek, pale.

03:50.814 --> 03:52.930
- Have you identified him?
- Not yet.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.523
But Goines is considered very dangerous.

03:55.652 --> 03:58.519
She killed her co-workers
a few years ago.

04:02.784 --> 04:06.197
- She killed all of them?
- Yeah. Well, all except this one.

04:06.329 --> 04:08.035
This man's missing.

04:10.333 --> 04:13.461
We think he may be connected
with Jennifer's disappearance.

04:13.587 --> 04:14.952
He got away.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.625
Could be an escaped victim
or her accomplice.

04:17.758 --> 04:23.469
- Is there something wrong?
- No. It's just so tragic.

04:24.681 --> 04:27.172
- (PHONE BUZZES)
- l have to get this.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.351
Dr Railly.

04:32.189 --> 04:34.680
Well, have you tested for hanta yet?

04:34.816 --> 04:39.025
OK, well,
I will be there as soon as I can.

04:40.322 --> 04:42.438
And this is the guy,
the one that got away?

04:44.701 --> 04:48.034
- He knows where the Night Room is.
- His name is Henri Toussaint.

04:48.163 --> 04:51.200
We met in Haiti
about a year after you kidnapped me.

04:51.333 --> 04:54.040
I went there with the CDC
to help with an outbreak.

04:54.169 --> 04:57.832
We worked together maybe a day or two
and then... I left.

04:57.964 --> 05:00.671
And where is this guy now,
still in Haiti?

05:00.801 --> 05:03.463
I don't know,
but I know someone who might.

05:11.853 --> 05:16.096
Wait a minute. I know this place.

05:17.275 --> 05:18.890
This is...

05:19.027 --> 05:22.485
It's not every day you see the building
you're gonna die in.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.155
MAN: Welcome back.

05:34.292 --> 05:35.998
Thank you.

05:36.127 --> 05:39.711
How long's it been? Hey, wait.
Did I tell you that Peggy had twins?

05:39.840 --> 05:42.081
- No.
- Yeah, they're cute too.

05:42.217 --> 05:47.132
So she's off playing house, and we're
a little short-staffed around here.

05:47.264 --> 05:51.098
You know, we could really use you
back full time if you're up for it.

05:52.936 --> 05:56.349
After Haiti, you were
a little off the rails for a while.

05:58.108 --> 06:01.851
- Jules, I'm not here about a job.
- Just think about it, OK?

06:01.987 --> 06:04.069
So, what's up with your patient?

06:05.073 --> 06:10.488
Well, it's leptospirosis,
but she's not responding to dialysis.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.201
I need an expert on tropicals.

06:12.330 --> 06:15.197
I was thinking
maybe that doctor from Haiti could help.

06:15.333 --> 06:16.948
That local guy, Henri?

06:17.085 --> 06:21.545
You don't know. No, no, of course.

06:21.673 --> 06:24.085
You already headed home
by the time we found out.

06:25.302 --> 06:27.338
He's dead.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.210
What happened?

06:29.347 --> 06:32.054
Shot. Never made it back
from that med run.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.968
- I sent him on that run.
- No, no, not your fault.

06:36.104 --> 06:40.143
You know how crazy things got after
the quarantine. Heard it was gangs.

06:40.275 --> 06:42.311
It's a shame.

06:44.613 --> 06:47.070
- I gotta talk to this guy.
- Cole, he's dead.

06:47.198 --> 06:48.574
Yeah, he's dead now.

06:48.700 --> 06:52.909
I can travel back to 2014, make him tell
me about the Night Room before he dies.

06:53.038 --> 06:54.619
- I don't know.
- What do you mean?

06:54.748 --> 06:56.284
Is that really the only way?

06:56.416 --> 06:59.579
If we waste time thinking up
another way, Jennifer could crack,

06:59.711 --> 07:04.000
the Monkeys find the Night Room
and the virus, that's it, it's over.

07:04.132 --> 07:07.169
- How will you find him?
- I don't know.

07:07.302 --> 07:09.258
You were there. You tell me.

07:09.387 --> 07:13.801
It... wasn't a good time.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.550
- Haiti is dangerous.
- I'm used to dangerous.

07:16.686 --> 07:19.553
No, there were gangs.
They took our meds.

07:19.689 --> 07:23.352
I'm the one who sent him out
to get more and it got out of control.

07:23.485 --> 07:26.147
Look, I can handle it. It'll be OK.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.440
No, it won't.
You're gonna see me there.

07:29.574 --> 07:31.735
Yeah. Yeah, I might.

07:31.868 --> 07:35.656
OK, well, when you're there, you do me
a favor and you stay away from me.

07:37.499 --> 07:39.080
Got it?

07:54.766 --> 07:57.382
(YELLS)

08:00.188 --> 08:02.770
Update, Mr Cole.

08:02.899 --> 08:05.891
It's nice to see you too.

08:06.027 --> 08:08.404
I need to go back to 2014.

08:09.531 --> 08:11.317
Haiti? That's preposterous.

08:11.449 --> 08:15.067
We should attempt to send Cole
back to 1987, just like Goines said.

08:15.203 --> 08:19.412
For what? We don't even know what
to look for, nor do we have the power.

08:19.541 --> 08:21.497
Then I say we go back
to Jennifer Goines.

08:21.626 --> 08:22.957
We've been over this.

08:23.086 --> 08:25.668
We can send Cole to Jennifer
before she's abducted.

08:25.797 --> 08:27.162
Mr Cole can eliminate her.

08:27.298 --> 08:30.711
At the risk of approximating
his previous self? Out of the question.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.584
We send Cole back to Leland Goines

08:32.721 --> 08:35.212
to interrogate him
before he blows his brains out.

08:35.348 --> 08:37.054
That is an acceptable risk.

08:37.183 --> 08:40.300
What if Leland is killed
before he tells us about the 12 Monkeys,

08:40.437 --> 08:43.554
or Jennifer before she tells us
the virus is in the Night Room?

08:43.690 --> 08:46.682
We'll have undone our own progress.

08:46.818 --> 08:49.981
We have worked too hard
for this information.

08:51.114 --> 08:53.981
RAMSE: Found this on the perimeter.

08:55.452 --> 08:58.194
- What's up?
- Huh?

08:58.329 --> 09:01.617
- You find any tracks?
- Just one. Scouts probably.

09:01.750 --> 09:07.666
If there were more, we'd know by now.
Either way, there's gonna be a problem.

09:07.797 --> 09:10.334
- I'm gonna take a look.
- There's nothing up here.

09:10.467 --> 09:13.459
- What are they doing this far north?
- They're animals.

09:13.595 --> 09:17.679
Scavs probably just looking for
something to eat, screw or piss on.

09:17.807 --> 09:21.550
- You boys would know best.
- No. You tell me, Whitley.

09:21.686 --> 09:27.431
See, I hear that there's a certain type
of man and he loves to get pissed on.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.775
- Watch yourself, little man.
- You like little men?

09:30.904 --> 09:33.361
We're go in two.

09:33.490 --> 09:36.402
- He'd like it, right?
- Oh, he'd love it.

09:36.534 --> 09:40.368
Mr Cole, we're sending you to Haiti.

09:40.497 --> 09:42.408
You don't look too happy about that.

09:42.540 --> 09:45.998
We found multiple references
to solar flares in 2014.

09:46.127 --> 09:47.628
OK, so?

09:47.754 --> 09:51.497
You'll probably experience temporal
and electromagnetic interference.

09:51.633 --> 09:54.796
What we don't know
is how it might manifest.

09:54.928 --> 09:58.136
- You're trying to kill him.
- Yes, we are.

10:00.683 --> 10:02.514
That's sarcasm, Mr Ramse.

10:04.062 --> 10:07.475
Yeah, I know what that is. I'm gonna go.

10:07.607 --> 10:10.144
- All right.
- Yeah.

10:10.276 --> 10:13.018
One more thing. Dr Railly.

10:13.154 --> 10:15.065
If she sees me, it could change things.

10:15.198 --> 10:18.361
Catastrophically.
It would fracture her timeline.

10:18.493 --> 10:21.155
The following year
she might never go to the hotel

10:21.287 --> 10:23.699
and save your life
from your gunshot wound.

10:24.666 --> 10:27.954
- Do you understand that?
- I got it.

10:28.086 --> 10:30.168
We cross paths, it could kill me.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.433
- Haiti? Right now?
- There's an outbreak.

10:49.566 --> 10:52.524
You've only been home a few weeks.
Can't you sit this one out?

10:52.652 --> 10:53.687
You know I can't.

10:53.820 --> 10:58.189
You have been working nonstop since you
got grabbed. Just take some time off.

10:58.324 --> 11:00.064
Let's get out of town for a while.

11:00.201 --> 11:04.490
Senator Royce will let you run off with
the Intelligence Committee heating up?

11:04.622 --> 11:07.659
I don't care about Senator Royce.
I care about you.

11:07.792 --> 11:10.329
Call Jules.
Tell him to send somebody else.

11:10.461 --> 11:15.876
It has to be me. People are dead.
Nobody knows what it is.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.340
Except you.

11:18.678 --> 11:21.761
- Aaron.
- Cos this is it, right?

11:21.890 --> 11:25.758
Just like the last one
and the one before that.

11:26.644 --> 11:29.602
You should call Dr Ron. You need help.

11:30.648 --> 11:32.684
- I'm fine.
- You're not fine.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.478
You're chasing after outbreaks

11:34.611 --> 11:39.196
because your kidnapper told you that
a virus is gonna wipe out the planet.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.157
Just tell me when you're coming home.

11:45.163 --> 11:46.778
I don't know.

11:47.665 --> 11:48.996
Huh.

11:52.712 --> 11:58.582
So, um... a year from now,
are you going to that hotel to find him?

12:00.720 --> 12:02.051
I have to go.

12:04.015 --> 12:05.880
The world's not gonna end, Cass.

12:17.987 --> 12:21.730
MAN ON RADIO: We are getting confirmed
reports of an outbreak in La Bosque

12:21.866 --> 12:23.527
that is rapidly spreading.

12:23.660 --> 12:25.776
The Red Cross Haiti Assistance Program

12:25.912 --> 12:29.700
has requested that the American CDC
step in and offer aid.

12:29.832 --> 12:34.075
Officials are hoping to avoid an
outbreak like yellow fever in the Sudan

12:34.212 --> 12:37.329
that claimed the lives of 165 people.

12:37.465 --> 12:40.423
More information
as this story develops.

13:16.713 --> 13:19.329
OK. Let's get you up here. Come on.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.965
- Dr Railly.
- Jules.

13:26.097 --> 13:28.964
- Thank you for coming.
- Sorry I missed the barn raising.

13:29.100 --> 13:32.012
We just got here.
Hospital's still down after the quake.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.852
Lucky for us, we got a local guy,
Henri Toussaint.

13:37.233 --> 13:40.270
- You take blood and cultures yet?
- Leaving on a jet plane.

13:40.403 --> 13:42.769
- Any suspects?
- We got a lot of broad symptoms.

13:42.905 --> 13:47.239
We got spiking fever, cough, fatigue.
Three dead, multiple organ failure.

13:47.368 --> 13:48.949
(SPEAKS HAITIAN)

13:49.829 --> 13:51.330
OK, wait 5 minutes.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.247
- Now.
- Stop, please.

13:58.379 --> 14:03.874
- Get her into a bed, now.
- You want help? Put that thing down.

14:04.010 --> 14:07.047
- You heard me, bitch.
- This isn't about her.

14:07.180 --> 14:10.968
- Shut up. Now get her into a bed.
- No problem.

14:11.142 --> 14:16.102
My friend and I are only talking, but
the air she's breathing could be affected.

14:16.397 --> 14:19.230
I hope she won't get sick.

14:21.569 --> 14:24.106
Come here. Come on.

14:25.740 --> 14:27.901
Let's go.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.650
- You guys OK?
- Yeah, for now.

14:30.787 --> 14:34.450
But if that guy was infected, we just
sent a walking vector out that door.

14:34.582 --> 14:37.574
- We need to isolate these tents.
- A little early for that.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.246
We don't know what this thing is.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.495
As soon as we do,
I'll escalate protocol.

14:41.631 --> 14:44.668
You've been travelling.
Don't burn out. We need you both.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.883
I'll reconsider
when I hear from Atlanta.

14:47.011 --> 14:49.593
Get some rest
and start fresh in the morning.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.495
Hey.

15:23.631 --> 15:25.713
Oh, hey.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.008
Can't sleep?

15:29.846 --> 15:32.053
- Me either.
- Is that helping?

15:33.224 --> 15:34.964
I'm happy to share.

15:35.101 --> 15:38.138
I thought, "This idiot
is going to get herself killed."

15:39.647 --> 15:40.807
I know. It's crazy.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.272
He backed down
because you were fearless.

15:43.401 --> 15:45.016
More like terrified.

15:46.404 --> 15:49.612
- It didn't show.
- I've got a lot of practice.

15:49.740 --> 15:51.867
A lot of practice
with a gun in your face?

15:51.993 --> 15:55.531
It's gonna happen
one way or another, death.

15:58.833 --> 16:02.667
You must be used to that kind of thing,
being a doctor down here.

16:04.172 --> 16:06.754
Bad things can happen anywhere.

16:06.883 --> 16:08.043
What do you mean?

16:08.176 --> 16:12.761
My sister had the measles
when she was a kid.

16:14.640 --> 16:17.302
I was her big brother
and I couldn't do anything.

16:20.646 --> 16:22.728
She died.

16:23.274 --> 16:28.394
You know, I thought, "Henri, if you were
a doctor, you would have the power."

16:33.743 --> 16:34.778
I was wrong.

16:36.329 --> 16:37.910
You can't control nature.

16:38.873 --> 16:41.660
And anybody who thinks they can
are kidding themselves.

16:41.792 --> 16:44.454
Nature doesn't break. It only bends.

16:49.300 --> 16:50.881
What do you think this thing is?

16:53.179 --> 16:56.091
Something we shouldn't underestimate.

17:02.980 --> 17:05.062
Are you scared?

17:09.820 --> 17:12.482
You're a lot smarter than I was.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.201
I hope I'm wrong.

17:16.327 --> 17:18.909
I imagine you rarely are.

17:20.748 --> 17:24.707
- It depends on who you ask.
- I don't need to ask.

18:26.355 --> 18:27.561
(RUSTLING)

18:29.900 --> 18:33.063
What the hell are you doing, Whitley?
I could have killed you.

18:33.195 --> 18:37.564
This is a patrol, not one of
your scavenger shoot-'em-ups.

18:37.700 --> 18:40.783
You don't know anything
about the outside.

18:40.911 --> 18:43.323
You were raised in Spearhead, man.

18:43.456 --> 18:46.744
You had rations, military protection.

18:47.793 --> 18:50.455
- You don't know anything about scavs.
- I know enough.

18:50.588 --> 18:52.453
Bullshit.

18:52.590 --> 18:54.672
They're like animals.

18:55.676 --> 19:00.295
Living off the weak.
Taking what they don't deserve.

19:00.431 --> 19:02.843
Like you and Cole.

19:04.352 --> 19:06.934
I'm not taking anything from you, buddy.

19:07.063 --> 19:11.227
Jones gets her traveler.
We get three squares and a roof.

19:11.359 --> 19:15.147
Trust me,
she gets the better end of the deal.

19:16.113 --> 19:18.229
If it was my call,

19:18.366 --> 19:22.905
you and Cole would be back out here
where you assholes belong...

19:23.954 --> 19:26.036
."buddy.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.993
Go ahead.

19:32.129 --> 19:36.293
I go back alone, do you think
anyone's gonna give a shit? Huh?

19:38.010 --> 19:40.092
But you come back alone...

19:41.138 --> 19:44.426
well, that could be interesting.

19:49.063 --> 19:51.349
Yeah, it would.

19:52.858 --> 19:54.018
That's what I thought.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.809
JULES: I want that wide open.

20:30.813 --> 20:32.895
Can I get some help here, please?

20:36.360 --> 20:37.896
Excuse me, please.

20:40.656 --> 20:43.989
- You need to open up that saline.
- It's spreading more, and fast.

20:44.118 --> 20:47.030
- We have to elevate containment.
- What happened here?

20:47.163 --> 20:49.870
The guy with the gun came back.
He took our meds.

20:49.999 --> 20:53.162
They took our antibiotics
and most of our pain meds.

20:53.294 --> 20:56.036
I know where we can get some.
I know a woman in town.

20:56.172 --> 20:58.413
She's got a supply.

20:59.842 --> 21:02.299
I need a doctor over here now!

21:31.707 --> 21:33.117
Mr Cole!

21:34.835 --> 21:36.211
Mr Cole!

21:39.757 --> 21:41.793
Temporal interference.

21:58.943 --> 22:01.150
OK, so what's the count now?

22:02.488 --> 22:04.774
(COUGHS)

22:06.075 --> 22:10.034
Is that guy coughing up blood?
Nurse, I want that man inside now.

22:16.418 --> 22:18.500
Thank you.

22:25.511 --> 22:28.344
Doctor. Doctor, I need to speak to you.

22:28.472 --> 22:30.428
- American?
- I'm staying with a family.

22:30.558 --> 22:33.641
- They're very sick. It's really bad.
- Tell them to come here.

22:33.769 --> 22:36.385
No, no, they can't.
They're too sick to travel.

22:36.522 --> 22:39.935
It's really bad. You need to
come with me, please. Please, Doctor.

22:40.067 --> 22:42.308
OK, sure.
I need a nurse on this patient.

22:43.779 --> 22:45.861
Wait. I need some supplies.

22:48.158 --> 22:50.285
Doctor, we have to
hurry up here, please.

22:50.411 --> 22:52.447
That's the guy
that was coughing up blood.

22:52.580 --> 22:55.538
Shit. Doctor, we have to go, please.

22:55.666 --> 22:57.452
- Give me a second.
- We have to go now.

22:57.585 --> 22:59.166
Sir.

22:59.295 --> 23:01.377
Hey! Hey!

23:02.214 --> 23:04.705
- Who was that?
- I don't know.

23:04.842 --> 23:07.549
He said he needed help,
but something spooked him.

23:07.678 --> 23:10.841
We can't allow infected people
to leave these tents.

23:10.973 --> 23:14.181
- We need to order a quarantine.
- Atlanta will never authorize it.

23:14.310 --> 23:16.175
Atlanta pays us to assume the worst.

23:16.312 --> 23:19.930
If this thing is airborne,
we've all been exposed,

23:20.065 --> 23:25.731
and all it takes is one guy
to get in a car or a boat or a plane

23:25.863 --> 23:28.479
and we're looking at a pandemic.

23:29.825 --> 23:33.158
All right, quarantine's on.
I'll push it through Atlanta.

23:35.331 --> 23:37.743
Those meds you told me about...

23:37.875 --> 23:41.208
Painkillers, antibiotics.
If they're sealed, we can use them.

23:41.337 --> 23:43.202
OK. Henri...

23:44.757 --> 23:45.837
Thank you.

25:17.224 --> 25:19.135
Stop.

25:20.436 --> 25:22.848
- I'm a friend.
- You're one of them.

25:22.980 --> 25:26.188
- I'm a friend of Jennifer Goines.
-Jenny?

25:26.316 --> 25:28.978
Yeah. She told me you got away.

25:29.111 --> 25:30.692
Shut up. You're lying.

25:30.821 --> 25:34.405
She's catatonic and she hasn't
said anything to anyone for months.

25:34.533 --> 25:37.650
Since they killed everyone
looking for the Night Room?

25:37.786 --> 25:39.822
How could I know that, huh?

25:39.955 --> 25:42.037
You know that
because you're one of them.

25:42.166 --> 25:46.000
That night, they came in
fast and organized, right?

25:46.128 --> 25:48.790
Led by a man, tall, pale.

25:49.965 --> 25:54.959
Listen, I'm alone.
I'm not... I'm not here to hurt you.

25:55.095 --> 25:57.051
I just wanna talk to you.

25:57.181 --> 26:00.264
I need you to tell me
the location of the Night Room.

26:00.392 --> 26:04.351
They wanna take what's in that room
and they wanna use it.

26:04.480 --> 26:06.892
They call themselves
the Army of the 12 Monkeys.

26:07.024 --> 26:11.188
They're looking for you too,
and if I can find you, so can they.

26:13.530 --> 26:15.521
I gotta take medicine
back to the tents.

26:15.657 --> 26:18.524
Allow me to be a doctor
and save these lives.

26:18.660 --> 26:21.151
You do that
and I'll tell you about the Night Room.

26:23.332 --> 26:25.414
Lead the way.

26:30.464 --> 26:31.670
RAMSE: Max.

26:33.509 --> 26:35.090
What are you doing here, Max?

26:36.762 --> 26:38.878
Ramse.

26:39.014 --> 26:40.550
It's been a while.

26:43.602 --> 26:46.685
Where's the West 7? Huh?

26:46.814 --> 26:48.770
- Where's Deacon?
- I don't know.

26:48.899 --> 26:51.857
Don't bullshit me!

26:53.403 --> 26:55.894
Where are they? How many?

26:56.031 --> 26:57.987
I'm alone, OK?

26:58.117 --> 26:59.527
I swear.

27:01.662 --> 27:04.995
- I left the 7.
- Nobody leaves the West 7.

27:05.124 --> 27:08.616
- You and Cole did.
- Deacon's been following us ever since.

27:08.752 --> 27:11.835
He probably sent you here
to get us too, right?

27:11.964 --> 27:15.957
I'm done with Deacon.
I'm done with all of them.

27:16.844 --> 27:21.588
That's not my life any more.
And I don't care if they come after me.

27:26.061 --> 27:27.847
Well, who's your friend?

27:27.980 --> 27:30.437
- Not my friend.
- Oh?

27:30.566 --> 27:35.276
He come from that building
back there too? What is it?

27:35.404 --> 27:39.522
- It's abandoned. We use it to camp.
- ls Cole in there too?

27:39.658 --> 27:43.367
No. We split up a while back.

27:43.495 --> 27:46.578
- Mm. Is that right?
- That's right.

27:46.707 --> 27:51.497
So that wasn't the two of you I spotted
a mile north of here about a week back?

27:51.628 --> 27:54.540
Is that where you left this? Huh?

27:57.885 --> 28:02.470
- What do you want, Max?
- I can't go back to the West 7, OK?

28:05.142 --> 28:06.222
He will kill me.

28:08.729 --> 28:12.142
I'm cold, Ramse. I'm hungry.

28:13.609 --> 28:19.320
Just let me come with you
in there for a few days.

28:19.448 --> 28:21.234
I mean, that's all I'm asking.

28:22.826 --> 28:29.493
There's a town
ten miles northeast from here.

28:29.625 --> 28:34.745
There's a group of survivors,
good people.

28:34.880 --> 28:37.337
You'll be safe.

28:37.466 --> 28:39.923
Yeah.

28:40.052 --> 28:43.340
OK. Yeah, sure.

28:45.974 --> 28:47.635
Well, tell Cole I say hey.

28:51.438 --> 28:53.520
So long, Max.

28:56.693 --> 28:58.775
Shit.

29:01.657 --> 29:04.899
Markridge had us working
in the Night Room on viral gene therapy.

29:05.035 --> 29:06.366
Take the DNA out of a virus

29:06.495 --> 29:09.362
and you can use it to deliver medicine
instead of a poison,

29:09.498 --> 29:11.204
but you need a very powerful virus.

29:11.333 --> 29:13.790
That's what you and Jennifer
were working on.

29:13.919 --> 29:17.286
If you want Jennifer to do something,
you ask her not to.

29:18.173 --> 29:20.585
Took me years to figure that out.

29:20.717 --> 29:22.833
COLE: That's why they came after you.

29:25.013 --> 29:27.675
Hello? Victoire?

29:31.019 --> 29:32.099
Merci, Victoire.

get their hands on Jenny,

in your former workplace, Markridge.

No, but when they do, it'll be unlike

- It's... gonna be worse.
- Just come with me. Come on.

No. You need me here.
I'm the only one who knows.

- We need to stop this.

to go outside and shoot people?

35:17.073 --> 35:23.410
Just before I left, OK, they were
upgrading a mobile containment system.

35:23.538 --> 35:27.326
The Big Burn, ultraviolet light powerful
enough to torch anything in the lab

35:27.459 --> 35:29.415
if the wrong virus got out.

35:29.544 --> 35:32.331
- How does that help me?
- Their specialized equipment.

35:32.464 --> 35:35.331
You find it, you find the Night Room.

35:38.595 --> 35:40.677
Thanks.

35:42.599 --> 35:48.515
I never thought that I would come back
here, but now I have nowhere else to go.

35:48.647 --> 35:52.060
- They're gonna keep hunting you.
- Let them try.

35:52.192 --> 35:55.480
They'll find you. They'll hurt you.

35:55.612 --> 35:59.981
They'll do whatever they have to to make
you tell them how to find that lab.

36:00.116 --> 36:04.985
Somewhere in the world
there's a dark corner needs a doctor.

36:05.121 --> 36:09.740
- There always is.
- You'll never make it off this island.

36:13.922 --> 36:16.629
You'll never make it out of here.

36:26.393 --> 36:32.810
Jules, listen to me. I know this sounds
extreme, but if this virus gets out...

36:32.941 --> 36:34.772
- Cassie...
- ...it is all over.

36:34.901 --> 36:38.985
You, me, our families,
everyone we know, it will be all over,

36:39.114 --> 36:43.733
starting right here, right now,
and it'll be all our fault.

36:45.870 --> 36:48.907
It's river fever, a rare strain.
That's why we missed it.

36:49.040 --> 36:52.077
Lab results just came back.
Vaccinations have been ordered.

36:52.210 --> 36:55.873
Quarantine's been lifted.
Thank God nobody listened to you.

36:56.798 --> 37:00.290
But, Jules, you have to understand...

37:00.427 --> 37:03.510
People could have been killed, Cassie.
You lost it.

37:04.389 --> 37:08.223
Whatever happened to you,
the kidnapping, you gotta deal with it.

37:09.269 --> 37:12.887
Go home. Take some time.

38:18.087 --> 38:19.338
Mr Cole.

38:21.049 --> 38:23.005
It's nice to see you.

38:26.221 --> 38:28.587
I know how to find the virus.

38:36.189 --> 38:39.306
That's good. You're steady.

38:39.442 --> 38:43.105
First time I shot a gun, the kickback
knocked me on my ass. You're steady.

38:43.238 --> 38:45.445
Well, that's because
I'm tougher than you.

38:45.573 --> 38:47.655
I believe that.

38:54.082 --> 38:58.872
OK, just remember, squeeze, don't pull.
If you pull, you can't hit anything.

38:59.003 --> 39:02.245
- I remember when l was...
- Cole, stop avoiding the subject.

39:02.382 --> 39:04.464
Tell me about Haiti.

39:06.803 --> 39:11.388
I told you. Henri told me how to find
the Night Room. What else is there?

39:13.017 --> 39:15.394
You saw me there, didn't you?

39:16.145 --> 39:19.103
Yeah. I stayed away.

39:20.191 --> 39:22.728
I had to follow Henri without you there.

39:22.861 --> 39:25.694
Left just after the quarantine ended.

39:31.286 --> 39:35.279
That was you
outside the tents that night.

39:36.624 --> 39:37.704
The lights...

39:42.338 --> 39:44.420
I was wrong about the plague.

39:46.801 --> 39:49.213
People could have died because of me.

39:50.096 --> 39:52.178
But they didn't.

39:53.641 --> 39:57.429
(SIGHS)
I'm gonna take the job at the CDC.

39:57.562 --> 40:03.023
There's no better place to look for that
containment system Henri told you about.

40:15.330 --> 40:17.412
It was my fault.

40:18.541 --> 40:21.499
I'm the one who sent him
to get those meds.

40:24.505 --> 40:26.587
Henri was a good man.

40:27.967 --> 40:30.049
Tell me what happened to him.

40:34.098 --> 40:38.137
After he told me about the Night Room,
we got separated.

40:45.401 --> 40:47.938
I splintered
before I could find him again.

40:51.240 --> 40:53.026
I never saw who killed him.

41:06.631 --> 41:08.713
Thanks.

41:25.233 --> 41:29.317
Ramse. I heard you got into it
on the perimeter.

41:29.445 --> 41:32.528
Something about saving Whitley's ass
from a scav.

41:39.288 --> 41:42.280
- It was Max.
- Where is she?

41:42.417 --> 41:45.375
She wanted in the facility.
I turned her away.

41:45.503 --> 41:48.836
I mean, do you know what Whitley
would do if he found her here?

41:48.965 --> 41:52.332
- She said she'd left them.
- You believe her?

41:52.468 --> 41:55.801
Leaving the West 7,
that's not an easy thing to do.

41:55.930 --> 41:58.342
- We did it.
- She's not us.

42:01.144 --> 42:03.806
- How'd she look?
- Pissed.

42:05.064 --> 42:09.353
Even if she left them,
they're gonna be looking.

42:09.485 --> 42:11.191
I'm telling you, they're close.

42:12.530 --> 42:14.896
COLE: He doesn't have the numbers
for an attack.

42:15.033 --> 42:17.649
RAMSE: He may not have had them then,

42:17.785 --> 42:20.447
but how many marauders
has he picked up by now?

42:20.580 --> 42:26.120
If he finds out about the facility,
the West 7 will pick us clean,

42:26.252 --> 42:28.493
just like everywhere else.

42:28.629 --> 42:31.712
MAX: I found shelter and food

42:31.841 --> 42:35.049
and water and power.

42:35.178 --> 42:37.464
And you won't believe what else.

42:37.597 --> 42:39.133
I found Cole.

42:45.188 --> 42:49.682
