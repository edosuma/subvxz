Afternoon, Sister.

Please, what is this about?

00:30.040 --> 00:32.320
We know the significance
of this convent.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.240
What it contains.

00:34.320 --> 00:36.360
I'm afraid your
location's been discovered

00:36.440 --> 00:38.560
by enemies of the realm.

00:38.640 --> 00:42.000
They're a rather uncivilised
lot so time is of the essence.

00:42.080 --> 00:44.360
They might be in
the town already.

00:44.440 --> 00:46.400
Now think, Sister,

00:46.480 --> 00:48.960
have you been approached
by anyone other than us?

00:49.040 --> 00:51.200
No, we've had no other visitors.

observing the filming,

That will be me, Dick
Lansky, producer.

know, a film shoot.

interest in the television,

06:42.560 --> 06:44.600
A falling light on
set is one thing,

06:44.680 --> 06:46.560
but a planted, loaded gun?

06:46.640 --> 06:47.800
That's attempted murder.

06:47.880 --> 06:49.160
-Agreed.
-Mm.

06:49.240 --> 06:51.120
But who was the real
bullet meant for?

06:51.200 --> 06:52.400
Let's consider.

06:52.480 --> 06:55.440
The lead actor, Hugo Steele.

06:55.520 --> 06:57.040
One might assume that
he was the target

06:57.120 --> 06:58.600
given that he was shot at,

06:58.680 --> 07:00.960
but fact, it was carefully
choreographed in the rehearsal,

07:01.040 --> 07:04.720
Hugo was to dive out of
harm's way before the gunshot.

07:04.800 --> 07:07.480
As you can see, the bullet
passed through the chair

07:07.560 --> 07:08.880
positioned directly behind him,

07:08.960 --> 07:11.320
a chair clearly marked
as the director's.

07:11.400 --> 07:14.200
So someone wanted
Ray Crawford dead.

07:14.280 --> 07:16.000
A fair assumption.

07:16.080 --> 07:18.040
However, complication.

07:18.120 --> 07:20.400
The producer, Dick Lansky.

07:20.480 --> 07:24.040
I've noticed he habitually
sits in the director's chair,

07:24.120 --> 07:25.680
a clear power game
between the men.

07:26.960 --> 07:28.520
It was, in fact, Mr. Lansky

07:28.600 --> 07:30.680
who vacated it at the last
moment to get a better view.

07:30.760 --> 07:32.400
And it was Mr. Lansky
who nearly got hit

07:32.480 --> 07:33.960
by the falling light.

07:34.040 --> 07:36.680
Sorry, but what do you
mean by a better view?

07:36.760 --> 07:38.760
There's nothing blocking
the view from the chair.

07:38.840 --> 07:39.720
Bravo, Peggy.

07:39.800 --> 07:41.320
I'm so glad that you asked that.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.360
So, quick show business tidbit,

07:43.440 --> 07:45.760
I am told that the
optimal vantage point

07:45.840 --> 07:48.760
is as close to the camera
as possible, and yet,

07:48.840 --> 07:52.160
note the unusual
distance between the
chair and the camera.

07:52.240 --> 07:54.560
Someone moved it to be
in line with the bullet.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.000
Someone who had to have
been at the rehearsal.

07:57.080 --> 07:59.560
Apart from you and Sister
Peter, it was a closed set.

07:59.640 --> 08:01.360
Who could have switched
the guns or moved the chair

08:01.440 --> 08:03.040
without being seen
by cast or crew?

08:03.120 --> 08:05.560
Well, perhaps it was
one of the cast or crew.

08:05.640 --> 08:07.200
Well, maybe this will
settle it, Sarge.

08:07.280 --> 08:08.840
I took everyone's fingerprints

08:08.920 --> 08:10.920
and wrote down their names
in full, just like you said.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.560
I even alphabetized them.

08:12.640 --> 08:14.040

Sister.

08:16.240 --> 08:18.480
-The moment of truth.
-Yeah.

08:18.560 --> 08:21.640
Now, the prop gun in the
bin had no prints on it,

08:21.720 --> 08:23.280
it was wiped clean,

08:23.360 --> 08:25.760
but I managed to lift two
distinctive thumb prints

08:25.840 --> 08:28.120
from the .38, one
large, one small.

08:28.200 --> 08:30.600
The smaller, I
presume, was Debra's.

08:32.880 --> 08:36.680
[gentle contemplative music]

08:36.760 --> 08:38.320
Correct.

08:47.040 --> 08:48.120
I didn't even know
it was missing.

08:48.200 --> 08:49.880

08:49.960 --> 08:51.240

And why should we believe you,

-Mr. Brumfield?
-Because...

08:54.160 --> 08:56.960
Look, I'm a TV writer.

08:57.040 --> 08:59.720
I know all about plotting crime.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.000
If I'd switched the guns,

09:01.080 --> 09:02.920
why would I leave my
own prints all over it?

09:03.000 --> 09:05.360
I must admit, as an avid
reader of whodunnits,

09:05.440 --> 09:07.560
I'd certainly have wiped
the gun clean myself.

09:09.160 --> 09:10.720
[Felix sighs]

09:10.800 --> 09:13.480
We have reason to believe that
Mr. Lansky was the target.

09:13.560 --> 09:15.640
There was also an incident
with a falling light.

09:15.720 --> 09:17.440
That nearly hit me, too.

09:17.520 --> 09:18.520
Not that anyone cares.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.280
Interesting.

09:21.360 --> 09:23.080

wanted to kill you as well?

No.

[pencil scratching]

09:25.640 --> 09:26.520
I don't think so.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.520
Why? Has someone said something?

09:28.600 --> 09:30.400
No, Mr. Brumfield.

09:30.480 --> 09:33.760
Can you think of anyone who
might want to kill Mr. Lansky?

09:34.760 --> 09:35.520
Course I can.

09:37.360 --> 09:38.520
He's a producer.

09:40.200 --> 09:43.080

for casting me, Mr. Lansky.

thank me, sweetheart.

was fired today at set,

10:05.200 --> 10:06.560
it may have been meant for you.

10:06.640 --> 10:07.800
-Oh yeah?
-Yeah.

10:07.880 --> 10:09.200
[Dick chuckles]

10:09.280 --> 10:10.920
Well, can't say I'm surprised.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.560
This doesn't concern you?

10:12.640 --> 10:15.440
Well, like I always say, if
you can't stand the heat,

10:15.520 --> 10:17.360
stay out of show business.

10:17.440 --> 10:19.600
Oh! [giggles]

10:19.680 --> 10:21.480
Could you think
of anyone specific

10:21.560 --> 10:23.880
that might've had a
grudge against you?

10:23.960 --> 10:27.520
A few actors I've booted off
the show didn't go quietly,

10:27.600 --> 10:29.320
but actors never do
anything quietly.

10:29.400 --> 10:31.360
Could you list them for me?

10:31.440 --> 10:32.720
[Dick sighs]

10:32.800 --> 10:35.640
Come on, then. [clears throat]

10:35.720 --> 10:37.000
Um, yeah.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.120
Jumped up little twerp.

10:45.880 --> 10:47.440
Ancient history, if you ask me.

10:47.520 --> 10:49.320
Now, if you'll, excuse me,
I have a show to shoot,

10:49.400 --> 10:50.800
and we are behind schedule.

10:56.720 --> 11:01.360
Is it just me, or are you
starting to like him? [giggles]

11:01.440 --> 11:03.760
I need to find out
more about these three.

11:03.840 --> 11:05.680
Oh, you know who you should ask?

11:06.720 --> 11:08.240
Jasper Berridge.

11:08.320 --> 11:11.120
He played Professor Pringle
in series one and two.

11:11.200 --> 11:16.040
-[upbeat jazzy music]
-[liquid bubbling]

11:20.960 --> 11:22.720
He always gave mind-bogglingly

11:22.800 --> 11:25.760
complex scientific explanations
to Hooper and Lang.

11:25.840 --> 11:27.760
Terrible old soak, Jasper.

11:29.400 --> 11:31.840
Couldn't remember his own
name without a prompt.

11:31.920 --> 11:34.640
You know, he once threw
a Babycham in Dick's face

11:34.720 --> 11:36.000
at the Dorchester.

11:36.080 --> 11:37.200
[both laugh]

11:37.280 --> 11:39.080
What about Derek Colt?

11:39.160 --> 11:41.360
Don't tell me, I know this one.

11:41.440 --> 11:42.880
Only appeared in one episode.

11:42.960 --> 11:44.400
The very first, in fact.

11:44.480 --> 11:47.800
[suspenseful jazz music]

11:47.880 --> 11:51.520
-[motorcycle rumbling]
-[suspenseful jazz music]

11:51.600 --> 11:53.280
He played Agent Harry Stone,

11:53.360 --> 11:55.200
Hooper's former partner in MI5

11:55.280 --> 11:57.680
before his tragic death
in a motorbike crash.

11:57.760 --> 11:58.560
Oh, she's...

11:59.760 --> 12:01.360
She's very good.

12:01.440 --> 12:03.000
Poor Derek.

12:03.080 --> 12:04.520
He was lucky to
survive that stunt.

12:04.600 --> 12:05.480
[Sister Peter gasps]

12:05.560 --> 12:07.040
You mean the fireball was real?

12:08.360 --> 12:10.600
Dick never wastes a good take.

12:10.680 --> 12:12.000
[suspenseful jazz music]

12:12.080 --> 12:13.360
Marigold Fritz?

12:13.440 --> 12:15.960
Four episodes, series three.

12:16.040 --> 12:17.600
She played Pippa Davinshire,

12:17.680 --> 12:19.960
one-time love interest
for Agent Hooper.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.320
Exposed as a double
agent by Agent Lang.

12:22.400 --> 12:24.600
At first it seemed Agent
Lang was just jealous,

12:24.680 --> 12:26.280
but she was proven right when-

12:26.360 --> 12:27.760
Get her off me!

12:29.240 --> 12:32.400
[actress shrieks]

12:32.480 --> 12:33.840
-[actress grunts]
-[suspenseful jazz music]

12:33.920 --> 12:35.200
Abominable cow.

12:36.600 --> 12:38.760
I had my neck in a
brace for a week.

12:38.840 --> 12:41.600
And after Dick fired her,
she pestered him for months.

12:44.680 --> 12:48.360
I say, you know
what you should do?

12:48.440 --> 12:50.040
Have a line in the ep.

12:50.120 --> 12:52.800
There's plenty of fake nuns
so why not a real one, eh?

12:54.200 --> 12:56.320
Okay, moving on
to the next scene!

12:59.480 --> 13:02.360
Assassin nuns, very good,
you're done for now.

13:02.440 --> 13:04.320
Okay, we'll do Pamela's close-up

13:04.400 --> 13:07.240
and then everybody
down to the cellar

13:07.320 --> 13:08.840
for Hooper's
electrocution scene.

13:09.880 --> 13:12.320
[tense music]

13:15.320 --> 13:16.760
Yeah, it was good.

13:16.840 --> 13:21.720
-[tense music continues]
-[birds singing]

13:26.000 --> 13:27.280
We made some calls to Equity.

13:27.360 --> 13:29.480
It seems Jasper Berridge
died last Christmas

13:29.560 --> 13:31.080
during a pantomime.

13:31.160 --> 13:32.960
Derek Colt became a
children's entertainer

13:33.040 --> 13:34.600
called Busby the Clown.

13:34.680 --> 13:37.200
And Marigold Fritz is
currently playing Cleopatra,

13:37.280 --> 13:39.640
upstairs at the Seven
Horses in Blackpool.

13:39.720 --> 13:41.920
So, quite patently, none
are in Great Slaughter,

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
where, in any case,
they'd be recognised.

13:44.080 --> 13:46.840
Deduction, whether connected
to the past or not,

13:46.920 --> 13:49.800
the culprit is presently
known to everyone.

13:49.880 --> 13:52.720
Well, whoever they are, I
pray they don't strike again.

13:52.800 --> 13:56.160
[playfully ominous music]

13:59.680 --> 14:02.760
Father, is that you?

14:02.840 --> 14:04.360
Father!

14:04.440 --> 14:05.960
No.

14:06.040 --> 14:07.320
Father, is that?

14:10.280 --> 14:11.040
Father!

14:12.920 --> 14:15.520
[ominous music]

14:18.960 --> 14:20.360
Hello?

14:20.440 --> 14:23.840
[ominous music continues]

14:26.840 --> 14:29.440
[door creaking]

14:31.360 --> 14:34.080
-[ominous music continues]
-Hello?

14:34.160 --> 14:37.560
[ominous music continues]

14:40.400 --> 14:45.240
-[Sister Peter screams]
-[suspenseful music]

14:46.080 --> 14:48.040
[shutter clicking]

14:48.120 --> 14:49.280
Perhaps you'll let
me know next time,

14:49.360 --> 14:50.760
before things escalate?

14:50.840 --> 14:53.480
But sir, I did, it
was all in the report.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.640
The one that was on your desk,

14:55.720 --> 14:58.640
with the big note that
read, "Please read."

14:58.720 --> 15:00.240
Well, if you're gonna
hide things on my desk

15:00.320 --> 15:01.560
-of all places.
-[shutter clicking]

15:01.640 --> 15:03.400
[Sister Boniface] Note
the rag in his mouth

15:03.480 --> 15:04.680
to muffle his cries.

15:04.760 --> 15:06.680
Electric bands on the temples,

15:06.760 --> 15:08.280
the current dialled all
the way up to maximum.

15:08.360 --> 15:10.080
He most likely died
of a heart attack.

15:11.400 --> 15:13.600
Looks like someone
punched him here, too.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.120
Clearly a winning personality.

15:15.200 --> 15:16.240
Indeed.

15:16.320 --> 15:17.560
And the presence of a dressing

15:17.640 --> 15:19.200
suggests it was
sustained earlier.

15:19.280 --> 15:22.080
Wherever it happened, it
would have bled copiously.

15:22.160 --> 15:23.560
Any thoughts on time of death?

15:23.640 --> 15:25.200
[shutter clicking]

15:25.280 --> 15:26.520
We'll have to wait for the
pathologist, of course,

15:26.600 --> 15:27.480
but from the stages
of rigour mortis,

15:27.560 --> 15:29.240
I'd say it was early in the a.m.

15:29.320 --> 15:30.080
Right.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.760
-Hello.
-[tense music]

15:35.840 --> 15:36.760
A hairpin.

15:38.120 --> 15:39.480
It must've fallen
from the killer

15:39.560 --> 15:41.400
as they lent over him.

15:41.480 --> 15:43.160
So it could be a woman.

15:43.240 --> 15:46.360
Sir, they're all out
there, asking questions.

15:46.440 --> 15:48.600
I've got a fair few myself.

15:49.800 --> 15:52.800
[gentle tense music]

15:55.280 --> 15:58.000
[cast murmuring]

15:59.040 --> 15:59.800
All right.

15:59.880 --> 16:00.640
Hello, I'm...

16:02.000 --> 16:03.480
Can everyone keep
it down, please?

16:04.680 --> 16:06.040
I'm D.I. Gillespie.

16:06.120 --> 16:08.480
I'm taking over
this investigation.

16:08.560 --> 16:10.240
Love the show, by the way.

16:10.320 --> 16:11.600
Nevermind that.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.360
Is Dick really dead?

16:13.440 --> 16:15.960
We heard he'd been
tortured, naked.

16:16.040 --> 16:18.680
Yeah, well, no, he wasn't naked,

16:18.760 --> 16:21.000
but he has been killed,
and that's all I can say.

16:22.320 --> 16:24.240
Everyone must remain
on the premises.

16:24.320 --> 16:25.440
What about the filming?

16:26.600 --> 16:27.680
Just asking.

16:27.760 --> 16:29.520
This is an active crime scene.

16:29.600 --> 16:30.560
That'll have to wait.

16:32.800 --> 16:34.360
Now, did anyone see Mr. Lansky

16:34.440 --> 16:36.240
go down into the
cellar last night?

16:36.320 --> 16:37.240
Was he alone?

16:37.320 --> 16:39.280
Did anyone see or hear anything?

16:39.360 --> 16:41.000
No, we were...

16:41.080 --> 16:42.920
We were all at the pub.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.800
Dick said we could finish early.

16:45.880 --> 16:47.640
Oh, show him the note.

16:47.720 --> 16:48.520
Oh, yeah.

16:50.160 --> 16:51.600
We were setting up the shoot,
the last scene of the day,

16:51.680 --> 16:53.640
and I found this
taped to the camera.

16:53.720 --> 16:55.120
It had five pounds inside.

16:56.440 --> 16:57.960
"Shoot the torture
scene in the morning.

16:58.040 --> 16:59.120
Have a drink on me.

16:59.200 --> 17:00.000
Dick."

17:01.000 --> 17:02.880
Did this seem odd to anybody?

17:02.960 --> 17:05.840
Well, I thought so, but
everyone just charged out.

17:07.040 --> 17:08.640
So, except for Mr. Lansky,

17:08.720 --> 17:11.400
was anybody else
missing from the pub?

17:11.480 --> 17:14.920
We were all there, as far as
I know, until closing time.

17:16.480 --> 17:18.000
So, the killer
left him handcuffed

17:18.080 --> 17:19.400
and gagged in the cellar,

17:19.480 --> 17:20.720
joined the others in the pub,

17:20.800 --> 17:22.720
and then returned later
on to finish the job?

17:22.800 --> 17:24.360
That's constructing
the perfect alibi.

17:24.440 --> 17:25.760
It's rather brilliant, really.

17:25.840 --> 17:27.760
Sam, can you confirm
something for me?

17:29.040 --> 17:30.280
I hear the producer
was found dead

17:30.360 --> 17:32.240
wearing nothing but
ladies undergarments.

17:32.320 --> 17:33.480
Ladies under?

17:33.560 --> 17:34.840
Where are you getting this from?

17:34.920 --> 17:36.520
No, he was fully clothed.

17:36.600 --> 17:39.120
And before you ask, we're not
ready to make a statement.

17:39.200 --> 17:41.360
Fully clothed. Good.

17:41.440 --> 17:43.480
I don't much care for smut.

17:43.560 --> 17:45.080
A showbiz murder,
on the other hand,

17:45.160 --> 17:47.640
now that is two scoops
with a cherry on top.

17:47.720 --> 17:49.400
Ah, you're all heart, Ruth,

17:49.480 --> 17:51.080
but who said anything
about murder?

17:51.160 --> 17:54.000
Well, you did, as good as,
by not making a statement.

17:56.560 --> 17:57.600
Sometimes I'd like to-

17:57.680 --> 17:58.560
Kiss her.

17:58.640 --> 17:59.520
-No, what?
-Oh.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.160
No.

18:01.240 --> 18:03.360
Don't you have some evidence
to examine or something?

18:03.440 --> 18:04.720
Right, you are.

18:04.800 --> 18:09.440
-[playful contemplative music]
-[Sam sighs]

18:11.920 --> 18:14.480
He couldn't have had the
good grace to die elsewhere.

18:15.800 --> 18:19.320
What on earth happened
for goodness sake?

18:19.400 --> 18:21.920
I believe it was heart
failure, Reverend Mother.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.240
Tragedy.

18:23.320 --> 18:25.000
I'm sure you'll want
us all to pray for him.

18:25.080 --> 18:26.520
Mmm.

18:26.600 --> 18:28.960
I'm sure this
unfortunate incident

18:29.040 --> 18:31.880
will put an end to their
filming, and good riddance.

18:32.960 --> 18:35.600
[birds singing]

18:37.760 --> 18:39.320
Cheer up.

18:39.400 --> 18:40.680
At least you got a souvenir.

18:42.200 --> 18:43.360
Is that the script?

18:43.440 --> 18:44.240
May I?

18:45.400 --> 18:46.160
Thank you.

18:49.080 --> 18:53.080
A gunshot in the show becomes
real, now a torture scene.

18:53.160 --> 18:56.080
If life is imitating
art, we need to know.

18:56.160 --> 19:00.960
-[ominous music]
-[birds singing]

19:02.880 --> 19:05.600
[door clattering]

19:07.160 --> 19:10.360
[gentle ominous music]

19:16.520 --> 19:18.080
Huh.

19:18.160 --> 19:22.080
[gentle ominous music continues]

19:30.920 --> 19:31.880
I think we solved the mystery

19:31.960 --> 19:34.120
of who punched Mr. Lansky.

19:34.200 --> 19:35.360
Aye, I thumped him,

19:35.440 --> 19:36.320
because he was
fooling around with

19:36.400 --> 19:37.680
-all the girls.
-What girls?

19:37.760 --> 19:40.640
The actresses, the
crew, the extras,

19:40.720 --> 19:42.480
even the ones who
were dressed as nuns.

19:43.480 --> 19:44.960
It was disgusting.

19:45.040 --> 19:46.320
Then I saw him going
off with Debra.

19:46.400 --> 19:47.720
Now, she's a nice
girl, a bit naive,

19:47.800 --> 19:50.080
so I followed them, right?

19:51.680 --> 19:53.840
Next thing I know, she's coming
out his trailer in tears.

19:55.400 --> 19:58.520
So, you punched him and
realised your mistake.

19:58.600 --> 20:00.600
He could have ended your career.

20:00.680 --> 20:03.600
What, so you think I
killed him, aye, very good.

20:03.680 --> 20:04.760
Suppose it was me who
was trying to drop

20:04.840 --> 20:06.440
lights on his bonce and all.

20:06.520 --> 20:08.880
Listen, I wouldn't
risk anyone's life

20:08.960 --> 20:11.160
and I wouldn't risk this show.

20:11.240 --> 20:13.320
I've been on "QT" since the
beginning, most of us here have.

20:13.400 --> 20:15.680
It's a labour of love.

20:15.760 --> 20:17.800
-[birds chirping]
-[Ray sighs]

20:17.880 --> 20:20.360
Listen, all I'm saying
is maybe you want to

20:20.440 --> 20:22.600
have a look at the guest artists

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
instead of the regulars,
like him, for instance.

20:27.080 --> 20:28.520
-[Bruno laughs]
-Nutter.

20:28.600 --> 20:30.920
Keeps offering
autographs to the fans

20:31.000 --> 20:32.280
as if he's one of the stars.

20:33.960 --> 20:36.120
And there's the
assassin nuns and...

20:37.800 --> 20:38.720
Debra, even.

20:38.800 --> 20:40.320
Oh, aye, she's all sweet,

20:40.400 --> 20:42.120
but who knows who
she really is, hmm?

20:44.080 --> 20:45.320
[Sam] Go and see what the
water works were about.

20:45.400 --> 20:46.360
Yes, sir.

20:47.720 --> 20:49.240
And you.

20:49.320 --> 20:50.920
Don't leave town until I say so.

20:51.000 --> 20:51.960
Well, why would I?

20:52.040 --> 20:53.920
I've got a show to finish.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.840
Now listen, fella, I know
you've got a job to do,

20:55.920 --> 20:57.520
but so do we.

20:57.600 --> 21:00.520
Livelihoods depend on it,
so can we please, please

21:00.600 --> 21:01.560
just get back to work?

21:03.480 --> 21:05.560
All right, but on
your heads be it.

21:05.640 --> 21:07.120
Not literally, I hope.

21:07.200 --> 21:09.960
You heard the man!
Places, everyone, please!

21:10.040 --> 21:13.200
Okay, I want to see
smiles, energy, pizazz.

21:13.280 --> 21:14.560
Dazzle me, everyone.

21:17.040 --> 21:19.840
So, you were seen leaving Mr.
Lansky's trailer in tears.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.400
Can you tell me what happened?

21:22.480 --> 21:24.120
Nothing happened.

21:24.200 --> 21:25.360
I left before it could.

21:25.440 --> 21:28.400
Ah, I see.

21:28.480 --> 21:29.720
And was there a
reason you agreed

21:29.800 --> 21:31.360
to be alone with
him, Miss Diamond?

21:32.720 --> 21:35.600
I liked the movies
he used to make.

21:35.680 --> 21:36.480
That's all.

21:37.480 --> 21:38.880
What's wrong with that?

21:38.960 --> 21:40.080
-Nothing.
-I suppose you think

21:40.160 --> 21:41.640
it's my fault he tried it on.

21:41.720 --> 21:43.200
No, I didn't mean to...

21:43.280 --> 21:44.120
[footsteps clomping]

21:44.200 --> 21:44.920
I'm sorry.

21:45.920 --> 21:49.120
[tense dramatic music]

21:55.440 --> 21:57.320
[Sam] Any clues on the hairpin?

21:57.400 --> 21:59.120
More like half a clue.

21:59.200 --> 22:01.520
Correction, more like
a tenth of a clue.

22:01.600 --> 22:03.680
A tenth of what you
may well ask, well!

22:03.760 --> 22:04.640
I wish I could say.

22:04.720 --> 22:06.360
I wish you would spit it out.

22:06.440 --> 22:08.480
Yes, well, that's a fair point.

22:08.560 --> 22:10.120
I'll try.

22:10.200 --> 22:14.400
So, I found a barely detectable
quantity of propylene glycol

22:14.480 --> 22:16.320
along with traces of
copper and magnesium,

22:16.400 --> 22:18.680
but I can't see for
certain what it is.

22:18.760 --> 22:20.400
Perhaps some kind of
industrial chemical,

22:20.480 --> 22:23.880
or it might be a component
in some kind of hair product,

22:23.960 --> 22:25.160
such as hairspray.

22:25.240 --> 22:26.520
That would certainly contain

22:26.600 --> 22:28.600
polyvinyl pyrrolidone
and polyvinyl acetate,

22:28.680 --> 22:29.920
but there's no trace of that,

22:30.000 --> 22:32.080
so you see, it really
is barely a clue at all.

22:32.160 --> 22:33.760
I think I preferred
the short answer.

22:33.840 --> 22:35.360
Yes.

22:35.440 --> 22:37.080
And from too little
evidence to far too much.

22:37.160 --> 22:40.480
So, I dusted the
typewriter keys for prints

22:40.560 --> 22:41.640
and as you can imagine,

22:41.720 --> 22:43.240
there are hundreds.

22:43.320 --> 22:45.320
We can assume that the
letter firing Mr. Crawford

22:45.400 --> 22:46.920
was the genuine article,

22:47.000 --> 22:49.400
and as for the fake note
sending everyone to the pub,

22:49.480 --> 22:52.320
same typewriter, undoubtedly
typed by our killer,

22:52.400 --> 22:53.120
but who was it?

22:58.240 --> 23:01.080
[perfume whooshing]

23:06.240 --> 23:09.480
[playfully tense music]

23:22.800 --> 23:24.360
Ooh.

23:24.440 --> 23:28.480
[playfully tense
music continues]

23:49.040 --> 23:51.280
[sighs] Not exactly
"Citizen Kane".

23:52.280 --> 23:53.520
True, but if Rosebud had been

23:53.600 --> 23:54.920
a glowing meteor
from outer space,

23:55.000 --> 23:57.200
he would have been
so much more fun.

23:57.280 --> 23:59.000
Is there nothing at all
illuminating in the script?

23:59.080 --> 24:00.360
Not really.

24:00.440 --> 24:01.800
Some of the pages are
different colours.

24:01.880 --> 24:03.160
I don't know why.

24:03.240 --> 24:05.080
Late amendments.

24:05.160 --> 24:06.960
I was given a line, you see.

24:07.040 --> 24:09.960
So, blue pages added
to the existing script.

24:10.040 --> 24:12.480
Changes before
that were in pink.

24:12.560 --> 24:15.640
But that means
that torture scene,

24:15.720 --> 24:19.840
-it was added later.
-[contemplative music]

24:19.920 --> 24:21.080
Whose idea was that?

24:21.160 --> 24:24.000
[contemplative music continues]

24:24.080 --> 24:24.880
Mr. Milton,

24:26.560 --> 24:28.960
I need to talk to you about
the torture scene in "QT".

24:29.040 --> 24:30.280
Apparently it was
your suggestion.

24:30.360 --> 24:33.000
Yeah, but it's been cut,
which is a real shame.

24:33.080 --> 24:35.160
Vlad was gonna say,

24:35.240 --> 24:38.080
"You people in the West,
you're like spoiled children.

24:38.160 --> 24:40.160
I know what it's like to suffer,

24:40.240 --> 24:42.360
I know what it's
like to sacrifice.

24:42.440 --> 24:43.440
In the KGB"-

24:43.520 --> 24:45.480
Okay, thank you, Mr. Milton.

24:45.560 --> 24:46.960
I'm not sure if you're aware,

24:47.040 --> 24:50.000
but Mr. Lansky was electrocuted
exactly the same way

24:50.080 --> 24:51.360
as in that scene,

24:51.440 --> 24:53.440
so forgive me if I'm
a touch suspicious.

24:54.400 --> 24:56.400
Well, that's horrible.

24:56.480 --> 24:58.880
I asked Mr. Lansky if I
could have a bigger scene.

25:00.640 --> 25:03.560
I didn't think it would
end up killing him. [sobs]

25:04.920 --> 25:06.320
Pull yourself together, man.

25:07.280 --> 25:08.040
Button.

25:08.120 --> 25:08.880
Excuse me.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.840
Sir, Miss Penny called.

25:12.920 --> 25:14.240
She asked to see
you at "The Bugle".

25:14.320 --> 25:15.120
Right.

25:16.080 --> 25:19.840
[playfully tense music]

-[bell tolling]
-[birds singing]

25:24.160 --> 25:27.080
[Ray] Is this supposed
to be our meteor?

25:27.160 --> 25:27.960
Yes.

25:29.720 --> 25:32.120
Could we please have one prop

25:32.200 --> 25:35.160
that isn't made out
of bleeding egg boxes?

25:35.240 --> 25:36.080
Go!

25:37.960 --> 25:39.520
Honestly.

25:39.600 --> 25:41.160
Well, awfully sorry
to bother you,

25:41.240 --> 25:43.160
but I had a line that was cut.

25:44.520 --> 25:46.000
As an assassin nun?

25:46.080 --> 25:48.400
No, a real one, in "QT".

25:48.480 --> 25:50.520
Also, I'm a real one in life.

25:51.840 --> 25:53.240
Could I please
have another line?

25:54.400 --> 25:55.320
[Ray sighs]

25:55.400 --> 25:56.560
Could she be in this one?

25:58.000 --> 26:00.560
She could see Vlad
and the assassin

26:00.640 --> 26:03.160
run past with the
bomb in the briefcase.

26:03.240 --> 26:05.440
When Hooper and Lang burst
from the confessional,

26:05.520 --> 26:08.040
she could say, "They
went that way!"

26:08.120 --> 26:10.120
Do you think you
can remember that?

26:10.200 --> 26:11.680
Yes, yes!

26:11.760 --> 26:13.160
"They went that way!"

26:13.240 --> 26:15.680
-[giggles] Thank you.
-All right, very good.

26:15.760 --> 26:17.960
Okay, people, places, please.

26:18.040 --> 26:19.560
Now, we're running behind,

26:19.640 --> 26:23.160
so we're gonna cut the rehearsal
and just go for a take.

26:23.240 --> 26:24.280
[Crew Member] Run sound!

26:24.360 --> 26:26.080
Sound speed.

26:26.160 --> 26:27.400
[Crew Member] Din over.

26:27.480 --> 26:28.320
Mark it.

Scene 30, take one.

26:29.800 --> 26:32.840

26:47.400 --> 26:49.360
-They-
-What on earth's

26:49.440 --> 26:50.640
going on here?

26:50.720 --> 26:51.520
Cut!

26:52.560 --> 26:53.480
Who are you?

26:56.160 --> 26:58.280
[birds chirping]

26:58.360 --> 26:59.680
Nuns with guns.

27:00.960 --> 27:04.840
Nuns with flesh on display.

27:05.920 --> 27:07.040
I'd never seen the like.

27:08.120 --> 27:10.160
Well, it stops now.

27:10.240 --> 27:13.360
I won't have those people
here a minute longer.

27:13.440 --> 27:15.040
Not so easy, I'm afraid.

27:15.120 --> 27:16.800

money's changed hands.

27:16.880 --> 27:18.680
Well, un-change it.

27:18.760 --> 27:21.320
What on earth would
Canoness Basil say

27:21.400 --> 27:23.400
if she knew about this?

27:23.480 --> 27:24.840
She does, Reverend Mother.

27:24.920 --> 27:26.320
Gave it her blessing, in fact.

27:32.280 --> 27:34.040
-[gentle ominous music]
-Her blessing?

27:36.400 --> 27:37.960
[gentle ominous music continues]

27:38.040 --> 27:38.840
I see.

27:40.320 --> 27:41.120
So.

27:44.960 --> 27:47.600
Then there's only
one thing to do.

27:50.520 --> 27:51.960
You can go now!

28:11.560 --> 28:13.400

28:13.480 --> 28:15.520
You must be
desperate for a lead.

28:15.600 --> 28:18.360
How about we skip the
jesting just this once?

28:18.440 --> 28:19.960
Where's the fun in that?

28:20.040 --> 28:22.400
Well, you obviously
have something,

28:22.480 --> 28:24.560
not quite enough to go to print,

28:24.640 --> 28:25.960
but enough to bargain with.

28:27.680 --> 28:28.760
So, let's bargain.

28:31.120 --> 28:33.360
A showbiz murder on my patch.

28:33.440 --> 28:35.440
If I don't break it
first, it looks bad.

28:36.760 --> 28:39.280
Well, we can't
have that, can we?

28:39.360 --> 28:42.600
[gentle sanguine music]

28:44.480 --> 28:46.920
Jean was talented
by all accounts,

28:47.000 --> 28:48.440
but this was her last film.

28:48.520 --> 28:51.000
She gave it all up to
have a baby in 1940.

28:52.800 --> 28:54.640
That kid would be
about your age now,

28:55.880 --> 28:57.560
and there's definitely
a resemblance.

29:00.560 --> 29:02.320
Dick Lansky was your
father, wasn't he?

29:04.960 --> 29:06.400
Did he know when he hired you?

29:06.480 --> 29:07.880
No.

29:07.960 --> 29:10.160
What really happened
in that trailer, Debra?

29:10.240 --> 29:11.680
Did you tell him who you were?

29:11.760 --> 29:16.040
I was going to, but
he got the wrong idea.

29:17.520 --> 29:22.080
-He tried to kiss me and I ran.
-[telephone ringing]

29:23.080 --> 29:23.960
That must've made you angry.

29:25.480 --> 29:27.400
-Angry enough to kill him.
-Of course not!

29:27.480 --> 29:29.440
He abandoned you
and your mother.

29:29.520 --> 29:31.080
You had every
reason to hate him.

29:31.160 --> 29:32.280
Well, I didn't.

29:33.840 --> 29:35.680
I just wanted to know my dad,

29:37.480 --> 29:40.800
but somebody killed him before
I got the chance. [sobs]

31:40.960 --> 31:42.520
Well, all sorts.

31:42.600 --> 31:44.720
Skin lotion. Cosmetics.

31:44.800 --> 31:47.000
It's a remedy for
treating burns.

31:47.080 --> 31:48.200
Burns?

31:48.280 --> 31:51.480
[contemplative music continues]

31:51.560 --> 31:54.880
Derek Colt, he was on the
first episode of "QT".

31:54.960 --> 31:57.120
He got burned during
a motorbike stunt.

31:57.200 --> 31:58.880
How could he possibly be here?

31:58.960 --> 32:02.160
[playfully tense music]

32:04.520 --> 32:06.640
His appearance has changed.

32:06.720 --> 32:10.280
[contemplative piano music]

32:11.960 --> 32:13.680
The once-handsome actor

32:13.760 --> 32:15.880
learned how to hide
his terrible scars.

32:17.280 --> 32:19.760
[contemplative piano
music continues]

32:19.840 --> 32:22.160
He's hiding now, in plain sight,

32:23.280 --> 32:24.160
as Vlad the Villain.

32:26.560 --> 32:28.280
Bruno Milton is Derek Colt.

32:30.400 --> 32:32.840
[tense music]

32:40.000 --> 32:41.720
Sir, it doesn't make sense.

32:41.800 --> 32:43.160
A set's just fell on him.

32:43.240 --> 32:44.600
Why would he deliberately
hurt himself?

32:44.680 --> 32:45.960
To throw us off the scent.

32:46.040 --> 32:47.760
I only questioned
him this morning.

32:47.840 --> 32:48.560
[knocking on door]

32:48.640 --> 32:49.400
Bruno?

32:51.040 --> 32:51.960
[knocking on door]

32:52.040 --> 32:53.480
Mr. Milton, it's the police.

32:57.000 --> 32:57.720
Mr. Milton?

33:00.320 --> 33:01.040
Stop.

33:02.720 --> 33:04.400
I said stop!

33:04.480 --> 33:06.520
[suspenseful music]

33:06.600 --> 33:07.400
[Sam] Felix?

33:08.560 --> 33:11.000
[tense music]

33:12.600 --> 33:15.200

-[Bruno grunts]

33:27.280 --> 33:28.000
You all right there, Felix?

33:28.080 --> 33:29.240
I'm fine.

33:29.320 --> 33:30.960
That was a cheap shot.

33:31.040 --> 33:35.920
-[both grunting]
-[tense music]

33:37.760 --> 33:42.320

-[rooster cawing]

33:42.400 --> 33:45.640
[tense music continues]

33:50.680 --> 33:51.880
Three operations it took

33:51.960 --> 33:53.960
just to get my mug
looking half-way normal.

33:55.280 --> 33:57.600
I could have been
the next Sean Connery

33:57.680 --> 33:59.040
if it wasn't for Dick.

33:59.120 --> 34:00.600
Why was it his fault?

34:00.680 --> 34:02.840
I said the stunt
was too dangerous.

34:02.920 --> 34:05.400
He gave me a drink
to steady my nerves.

34:05.480 --> 34:08.240
"Go on, Derek, you'll
be fine," he said.

34:08.320 --> 34:11.000
And then, [mimics explosion
blasting] up in smoke,

34:11.080 --> 34:13.160
just like my career.

34:13.240 --> 34:14.640
Took him to court
for loss of earnings

34:14.720 --> 34:17.200
but he stitched me
up like a kipper.

34:17.280 --> 34:20.440
Said it was my fault
because I'd been drinking.

34:20.520 --> 34:22.800
Got that writer Bernard
to testify against me.

34:23.920 --> 34:25.760
So, the light that fell?

34:25.840 --> 34:27.400
It was meant for both of them?

34:27.480 --> 34:30.480
Thought I'd try and kill
two turds with one stone.

34:30.560 --> 34:32.880
Look, we get it, they
screwed you over,

34:32.960 --> 34:34.640
but why kill them
after all these years?

34:34.720 --> 34:36.160
Why not move on?

34:36.240 --> 34:37.480
Move on?

34:37.560 --> 34:38.360
To what?

34:39.360 --> 34:41.440
Entertaining dribbling kids?

34:41.520 --> 34:43.360
And every week I had to
listen to my mum saying

34:43.440 --> 34:46.600
how much she loves
"Operation QT".

34:46.680 --> 34:48.040
That's nice, innit?

34:48.120 --> 34:49.960
It's still her favourite show.

34:50.040 --> 34:51.920
A villain playing a villain.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.040
Your greatest role yet.

34:54.120 --> 34:55.960
Pity no one will remember it.

34:56.040 --> 34:57.280
You'll be locked away

34:57.360 --> 34:58.920
and the rest of the
world will be tuning in,

34:59.000 --> 35:02.200
including your mum, to
watch "Operation QT".

35:02.280 --> 35:03.600
If you say so.

35:03.680 --> 35:04.840
[ominous music]

35:04.920 --> 35:06.760
What does that mean?

35:06.840 --> 35:09.200
[ominous music continues]

35:09.280 --> 35:10.800
The gunshot.

35:10.880 --> 35:11.800
The torture scene.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.320
You're mirroring the script.

35:15.400 --> 35:17.320
There's a bomb in the
briefcase at the end.

35:18.520 --> 35:19.840
You'd really blow everyone up?

35:19.920 --> 35:21.920
Of course I wouldn't.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.600
Just Bernard.

35:23.680 --> 35:28.480
-[ominous music]
-[both shuffling]

35:29.000 --> 35:29.920
Bernard!

35:30.000 --> 35:31.560
We need to rewrite, quick sharp.

35:31.640 --> 35:32.400
[Bernard snores]

35:32.480 --> 35:34.360
Oh, wake up, man.

35:34.440 --> 35:35.760
Listen, Bruno's been arrested

35:35.840 --> 35:37.400
and Vlad's in this final scene.

35:37.480 --> 35:38.760
[Bernard snores]

35:38.840 --> 35:42.160
Oh, what?

35:42.240 --> 35:44.960
[Bernard snores]

35:48.120 --> 35:48.880
[door clatters]

35:48.960 --> 35:52.560
[gentle serene music]

35:52.640 --> 35:54.080
Canoness Basil.

35:54.160 --> 35:55.160
What brings you here?

35:56.160 --> 35:57.880
Everyone, please make way.

35:57.960 --> 35:59.840
No need for fanfare,
Sister Peter,

35:59.920 --> 36:01.920
it's not a papal visit.

36:02.000 --> 36:05.040
Where should we stand to
avoid being in the shot?

36:06.840 --> 36:08.440
Is that how they say it?

36:08.520 --> 36:10.120
Spot on, Canoness Basil,

36:10.200 --> 36:12.880
and it's quite safe
to stand with us.

36:12.960 --> 36:16.280
Oh yes, I'd like the
three of you close at hand

36:16.360 --> 36:20.440
when Canoness Basil truly
appreciates what's in store.

36:22.080 --> 36:24.200
Well, surprise, surprise!

36:24.280 --> 36:27.560
Bernard's absolutely
pished, again,

36:27.640 --> 36:29.840
so we're just gonna
have to wing it.

36:29.920 --> 36:34.200
Uh, Debra, we can
just have Katya

36:34.280 --> 36:38.040
leave the bomb on
the alter instead,

36:38.120 --> 36:41.840
and then you spot the
meteor that Vlad left.

36:41.920 --> 36:43.240
I can't resist touching it

36:43.320 --> 36:45.240
so I'm possessed
with evil forces.

36:45.320 --> 36:46.880
That's good, I like it.

36:46.960 --> 36:50.120
Then, enter the assassin
nuns who all spasm and die

36:50.200 --> 36:54.960
and then the big floating
crucifix flies off the alter

36:57.400 --> 36:58.480
and kills Katya.

37:01.320 --> 37:03.080
Yeah.

37:03.160 --> 37:04.520
Right. [claps hands]

37:04.600 --> 37:05.560
Everybody got that?

37:05.640 --> 37:07.840
[playfully tense music]

37:07.920 --> 37:10.200
I most certainly did.

37:10.280 --> 37:14.320
[playfully tense
music continues]

37:20.880 --> 37:21.640
Is he dead?

37:22.920 --> 37:25.360
[Felix sighs]

37:29.760 --> 37:33.080
Sleeping pills,
to keep him here.

37:33.160 --> 37:34.480
Where's the bomb?

37:34.560 --> 37:36.720
Wait, are they still filming?

37:36.800 --> 37:38.920
-[suspenseful music]
-[floor clattering]

37:39.000 --> 37:41.200
Did you imagine this
unedifying spectacle

37:41.280 --> 37:43.440
would escape my notice?

37:44.880 --> 37:46.760
We just thought it was harmless.

37:46.840 --> 37:48.240
[tense music]

37:48.320 --> 37:49.880
Everybody stay calm.

37:49.960 --> 37:52.440
-I just need to check that.
-Sir, right here, right here.

37:52.520 --> 37:53.520
That briefcase.

37:55.920 --> 37:57.480
Good Lord.

37:57.560 --> 37:58.440
What is it?

37:58.520 --> 37:59.800
-It's a bomb.
-A bomb?

37:59.880 --> 38:02.760
-[tense music]
-[cast murmuring]

38:02.840 --> 38:03.640
Good idea.

38:03.720 --> 38:05.000
Everybody, go outside.

38:05.080 --> 38:07.360
Okay, Felix, we need to
clear the whole convent.

38:07.440 --> 38:09.960
We don't know how far
the blast radius will be.

38:10.040 --> 38:12.280
Okay. [gasping]

38:12.360 --> 38:13.880
We've got a minute.

38:13.960 --> 38:15.840
I'm gonna stay with the
bomb and try and disarm it.

38:15.920 --> 38:17.400
Do you have the first idea how?

38:17.480 --> 38:18.360
[Sam grunts]

38:18.440 --> 38:20.000
Right.

38:20.080 --> 38:21.040
Well, we had a lesson in
bomb disposal at Bletchley.

38:21.120 --> 38:22.040
A lesson?

38:22.120 --> 38:23.000
Well, half lesson, actually.

38:23.080 --> 38:24.600
One of our listening stations

38:24.680 --> 38:26.200
picked up an Knickebein
transmission and, right-oh.

38:26.280 --> 38:27.320
Task at hand.

38:27.400 --> 38:28.600
[tense music]

38:28.680 --> 38:30.440
Sisters, I told you to go.

38:30.520 --> 38:32.040
Now!

38:32.120 --> 38:33.600
I don't think you realise
how serious this is.

38:33.680 --> 38:34.800
And I don't think you realise

38:34.880 --> 38:37.320
the power of prayer, Inspector.

38:37.400 --> 38:39.080
Kept me alive in the blitz.

38:39.160 --> 38:41.240
[tense music continues]

38:41.320 --> 38:42.600
Now, if memory serves,

38:42.680 --> 38:44.200
the wires are bundled
together in a module

38:44.280 --> 38:45.680
and the wire to
cut is usually red.

38:45.760 --> 38:47.040
Well, they're all red

38:47.120 --> 38:48.000
and we don't have
any wire cutters.

38:48.080 --> 38:49.640
15 Seconds.

38:49.720 --> 38:51.240
Well, you just need to yank
the right one out, then.

38:51.320 --> 38:52.760
-Right.
-So, it should be

38:52.840 --> 38:55.760
the last wire at the
bottom of the bundle.

38:55.840 --> 38:56.560
Or is it the top?

38:57.920 --> 38:59.800
Hmm, now, it's not
a collapsing circuit

38:59.880 --> 39:01.480
so I just need to
trace the correct wire-

39:01.560 --> 39:04.200
For the love of God,
Sister, five seconds.

39:04.280 --> 39:07.280
As I thought, the one
closest to the power supply.

39:07.360 --> 39:08.360
And out.

39:08.440 --> 39:09.320
You.

39:09.400 --> 39:11.000
-Come.
-[bell dings]

39:12.480 --> 39:14.920
-Ha.
-[Sam gasps]

39:15.000 --> 39:18.040
[Sam exhales]

39:18.120 --> 39:21.480
Right, I'll get rid
of this, shall I?

39:21.560 --> 39:22.520
I would.

39:22.600 --> 39:23.400
Yeah.

39:25.600 --> 39:27.840
-[Sam exhales]
-Wait!

39:27.920 --> 39:32.320
Won't they need the briefcase
for the final scene?

39:32.400 --> 39:34.040
Final scene?

39:34.120 --> 39:37.360
After we all nearly lost our
lives and the convent, too?

39:38.720 --> 39:42.360
Canoness Basil will
not stand for it,

39:42.440 --> 39:43.360
and neither will I.

39:44.760 --> 39:46.960
This show is utter tripe

39:47.040 --> 39:49.080
-and blasphemy-
-"Operation QT"

39:49.160 --> 39:50.800
isn't blasphemous.

39:50.880 --> 39:51.880
Sister Peter, I think we've
heard quite enough from you.

39:51.960 --> 39:53.440
Hold on, Reverend Mother.

39:55.560 --> 39:58.800
I'd like to hear how it is not.

39:58.880 --> 40:02.360
Because it brings
millions of people

40:02.440 --> 40:04.920
-so much joy, Canoness Basil.
-[uplifting music]

40:05.000 --> 40:06.520
There's nothing
unholy about that.

40:08.160 --> 40:11.520
Every week, the heroes in
the story fight evil and win,

40:11.600 --> 40:15.520
and isn't that what happened
here today in God's house?

40:15.600 --> 40:18.760
Surely that means He gives His
blessing to these good people

40:18.840 --> 40:20.160
in the practise of their art.

40:21.320 --> 40:22.600
Art.

40:22.680 --> 40:24.000
And, after all-

40:24.080 --> 40:26.320
Yes, all right, that'll do.

40:26.400 --> 40:29.680
[swanky jazz music]

40:29.760 --> 40:30.840
I must say,

40:32.240 --> 40:35.720
I am rather curious to
see a flying crucifix.

get the cameras rolling!

Mr. Crawford.

40:54.240 --> 40:56.960
Might Sister Peter have
that line after all?

With your permission, of
course, Reverend Mother.

unleashed by the meteor.

-Save me!

[Sister Peter] Please, Lord.

41:23.600 --> 41:25.800
Save all souls from
these sadistic Soviets.

Get yourself to safety, Sisters.
