[suspenseful synth music]

00:12.011 --> 00:14.806
[man]
There's some romance about bees.

00:17.100 --> 00:20.729
Romances are not so easily explained.

00:23.022 --> 00:24.691
You just have to feel that.

00:26.359 --> 00:31.573
Honey has the greatest cachet
in the marketplace, of all food items.

00:32.407 --> 00:35.201
Nothing else has that high of a rating.

00:39.789 --> 00:41.583
[narrator]  Honey is everywhere.

00:42.667 --> 00:47.213
A sweetener so natural, so exalted,
that its value has held up for millennia.

00:49.090 --> 00:52.927
[man]  More of us are wanting
to buy food that we know the source of.

00:53.011 --> 00:58.808
The honey industry is perfect
for a food-enlightened culture.

00:59.768 --> 01:03.021
[narrator]  But honey is also perfect
for savvy profiteers

01:03.438 --> 01:07.609
who are secretly cutting the world's honey
with cheap substitutes.

01:08.568 --> 01:10.820
The supply cannot meet the demand.

01:11.237 --> 01:16.201
Consumers are eating a product
that is not honey.

01:16.951 --> 01:18.620
[narrator]  All along the supply chain,

01:18.703 --> 01:22.832
the 9,000-year tradition of beekeeping
is under full-scale assault.

01:23.750 --> 01:27.337
Industrial farming is wiping out
the bees' habitat.

01:27.420 --> 01:30.131
Bees are dying by the tens of billions.

01:30.215 --> 01:31.883
[man]  They don't bounce back.

01:31.966 --> 01:35.929
Just one thing sets them on their head
and they're done. They just never recover.

01:37.555 --> 01:41.726
[narrator]  And the lure of quick cash
has spawned a new kind of honey crime.

01:43.812 --> 01:46.689
[man]  That guy
then pays double for a product

01:46.773 --> 01:50.110
that is not what it says on the label.

01:50.193 --> 01:52.320
It is a fraud, and that's a crime.

02:01.287 --> 02:03.289
[tense orchestral music]

02:36.072 --> 02:38.950
[man]  I learn something new
about bees almost every year.

02:41.369 --> 02:44.122
There's just an unstoppable depth
to the bees.

02:44.205 --> 02:46.666
There's so much detail in what they do.

02:52.005 --> 02:55.633
So the first time I got stung,
my face swelled up.

02:57.260 --> 02:59.721
That was it for me, at eight years old.

03:00.346 --> 03:02.849
But I got stung again
and it wasn't as bad.

03:06.686 --> 03:10.815
By the time I was 15 or 16,
I was working bees on a regular.

03:11.441 --> 03:13.318
You got hive tools over there, JP?

03:14.986 --> 03:16.696
Yeah, got it.

03:16.779 --> 03:21.200
The bees are feeding off of these trees
behind us, the Yaupon holly,

03:21.784 --> 03:23.995
so they get nectar from those blooms.

03:25.121 --> 03:27.707
These bees are like,
"You all are out of your mind."

03:32.170 --> 03:35.089
[narrator]  In the spring and summer,
the honey bee gorges herself

03:35.173 --> 03:37.425
on the nectar of a thousand flowers.

03:38.343 --> 03:40.803
But blossoms fade and wither away,

03:40.887 --> 03:43.806
and bees want to keep eating the nectar
all year long,

03:44.265 --> 03:46.517
so they preserve it, and store it.

03:48.895 --> 03:50.813
The result is so delicious

03:50.897 --> 03:54.150
that humans have been savoring it
for thousands of years.

03:57.153 --> 04:00.031
The bees drink up
the nectar in the flower.

04:00.114 --> 04:02.867
They'll suck it up.
Their tongue is almost like a straw.

04:03.618 --> 04:06.621
And they have a special stomach.
We call it a honey gut.

04:07.247 --> 04:11.459
And they use that
to add enzymes to the nectar.

04:13.503 --> 04:16.005
[narrator]  The bee returns
to the hive carrying a load

04:16.089 --> 04:18.591
that weighs almost as much as she does,

04:18.675 --> 04:21.761
and spits up the nectar
into another bee's mouth.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.846
They go through that three times.

04:23.930 --> 04:27.392
One bee will add a little bit, pass it on
to the next bee. She'll add a bit.

04:29.769 --> 04:33.022
And the last step is for them
to store it in a cell.

04:33.106 --> 04:35.358
They fan it a little bit to air it.

04:36.192 --> 04:39.904
[narrator]  Their wings flapping
more than 12,000 times a minute,

04:39.988 --> 04:44.284
the bees dehydrate the nectar
and thicken it into a golden syrup.

04:48.162 --> 04:51.666
That's honey they haven't sealed yet,
because they're still filling it.

04:53.418 --> 04:56.546
They're either adding honey to it
or closing it up.

04:59.465 --> 05:02.760
And these are full frames
of honey, sealed up.

05:03.886 --> 05:05.930
They will open that
whenever they need to,

05:06.014 --> 05:10.143
and that may not be until, you know,
December when they get hungry again.

05:10.977 --> 05:12.603
We're gonna take that burden off them.

05:14.397 --> 05:16.524
Really what we're doing is robbing them.

05:18.693 --> 05:23.698
[narrator]  A worker bee lives 40 days,
and makes less than a teaspoon of honey.

05:24.532 --> 05:28.036
But in high season,
the 50,000 bees in a single colony

05:28.119 --> 05:30.788
can make 30 pounds a week.

05:32.123 --> 05:33.875
[Jon] That's at least 60 pounds.

05:33.958 --> 05:36.169
We're going to give it
a couple bounces.

05:37.045 --> 05:40.006
[bees buzzing]

05:42.300 --> 05:46.179
That's where the bees got most
of the nectar from, that yaupon nectar.

05:49.390 --> 05:51.851
We get stung less with the smoke.

05:57.273 --> 06:00.902
This is what I'm talking about.
Getting that honey right out of the hive.

06:05.198 --> 06:08.451
Even as a kid that was the best part
about coming out to the bee yard.

06:09.118 --> 06:10.953
-[Jon] See that piece?
-[JP] Yeah.

06:11.037 --> 06:12.914
-[Jon] Tear that.
-[JP] Look at that.

06:13.456 --> 06:15.333
-Yeah!
-[Jon] That's good stuff.

06:15.416 --> 06:18.836
[JP] We're just going to throw that
on top of the box and bring it back.

06:23.299 --> 06:26.010
[Jon]  Just like little pets,
when they're feeding like that.

06:30.264 --> 06:33.434
A lot of the honey we're pulling off
is just in the top of the hive.

06:34.102 --> 06:37.772
There's honey that we're not taking,
that will stay with them.

06:39.774 --> 06:43.945
[narrator]  For beekeepers, the care
of the colony is a sacred cause.

06:45.738 --> 06:47.532
Even so, for more than a decade,

06:47.615 --> 06:51.327
bees around the world
have been dying in record numbers.

06:53.996 --> 06:55.081
[man]  You never know.

06:55.164 --> 06:58.126
Even though you got your bees
all up and going, you never know.

06:58.209 --> 07:02.255
You can go back in two weeks and your bees
would all be gone. They just disappear.

07:02.338 --> 07:04.090
That's colony collapse.

07:04.173 --> 07:05.675
They have never figured it out.

07:05.758 --> 07:07.510
It's not like they've been sprayed.

07:07.593 --> 07:10.346
They're not laying dead
in front of the hive.

07:11.305 --> 07:13.891
[narrator]  When the crisis erupted
around 2006,

07:13.975 --> 07:16.561
it was labeled "colony collapse disorder."

07:17.061 --> 07:21.524
Today, scientists believe the bees
are dying from a combination of stresses,

07:21.607 --> 07:24.360
brought on by parasites, by insecticides,

07:24.444 --> 07:28.197
and by agri-business monocultures
that replace flowering meadows

07:28.281 --> 07:31.742
with acres of crops
which offer bees no nectar at all.

07:33.369 --> 07:36.998
Beekeepers have found ways
to rebuild their bee colonies.

07:37.081 --> 07:40.585
But the amount of honey the bees make
keeps dropping.

07:41.419 --> 07:43.212
[man]  We work very hard

07:43.296 --> 07:48.217
to ameliorate
all of these stress factors on bees,

07:48.885 --> 07:52.180
and yet our colony loss numbers
in the United States

07:52.597 --> 07:55.766
are right now at about 50% per year.

07:57.852 --> 08:02.607
It would be shocking if all
the cattle ranchers of America said,

08:02.690 --> 08:04.567
"We lost half our cattle this winter."

08:05.735 --> 08:09.739
But somehow when the beekeeper says,
"We lost half our bees,"

08:09.822 --> 08:11.699
it's not quite as shocking.

08:11.782 --> 08:14.452
[mysterious harp music]

08:32.261 --> 08:33.846
[narrator]  It's not just the bees.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.891
Beekeepers are fighting to stay alive.

08:38.559 --> 08:40.853
Struggling in a global business
that is soured

08:40.937 --> 08:44.357
by deception, corruption, and larceny.

08:46.400 --> 08:49.445
[harp music builds in intensity]

09:00.206 --> 09:02.792
[mechanical rattling]

09:18.516 --> 09:22.979
[narrator]  The crazy thing is,
the honey business is actually booming.

09:23.062 --> 09:25.189
Everyone is eating more honey.

09:25.815 --> 09:29.777
For almost a decade, worldwide
honey consumption has been rising

09:29.860 --> 09:32.446
by more than 40 million pounds a year.

09:34.949 --> 09:38.035
The US alone is responsible
for more than half of that.

09:47.712 --> 09:49.922
The math doesn't make sense.

09:51.549 --> 09:55.303
Honey production is dropping,
but consumption is soaring?

10:02.560 --> 10:06.897
[man]  Honey consumption
has been increasing for two reasons:

10:06.981 --> 10:10.026
because the human population
is increasing;

10:10.109 --> 10:15.197
and the increase in importance
of more natural products.

10:17.783 --> 10:19.910
Honey is used as an ingredient

10:20.369 --> 10:23.414
which gives an added value
to the product,

10:23.497 --> 10:27.126
because it relates the product
to a natural product.

10:27.209 --> 10:31.672
So the name "honey" is an added value.

10:33.132 --> 10:36.927
[slow, moody guitar music]

10:39.680 --> 10:42.516
[narrator]  The reality is that
our bodies process honey

10:42.600 --> 10:45.728
more or less the same way
they do all other sugars.

10:46.562 --> 10:49.523
But food makers looking
to please picky consumers

10:49.607 --> 10:53.569
have switched from sugar to honey
to sweeten dozens of products.

10:56.572 --> 11:00.409
Everything from bread to potato chips
to cookies to sliced ham.

11:06.207 --> 11:10.169
Tony Schmitz and his father Doug
started out as beekeepers.

11:10.836 --> 11:14.423
But as the demand for honey increased,
they moved into packing.

11:16.425 --> 11:19.512
We buy honey from beekeepers
from around the world,

11:19.595 --> 11:21.806
and our job is to blend
those honeys together,

11:22.390 --> 11:25.893
making that honey easy
for the food manufacturer to use.

11:26.644 --> 11:30.356
[narrator]  American hives produce
about 160 million pounds a year.

11:30.981 --> 11:34.193
But we eat 450 million pounds,

11:34.652 --> 11:37.321
so the US imports
twice as much as it makes.

11:38.989 --> 11:40.408
How much honey is in the tank?

11:41.617 --> 11:43.828
-He's done.
-Open her up.

11:49.208 --> 11:52.586
[Tony Schmitz]  There's thousands
of varieties of honey through the world.

11:52.670 --> 11:57.925
A packer's job is to blend different
varieties, colors, types of honeys

11:58.008 --> 12:00.344
in large commercial quantities.

12:03.055 --> 12:06.350
[Doug Schmitz]  We're blending honey
over here for a bread company.

12:06.434 --> 12:10.729
We go through the building here,
and pull honey ready to be used.

12:10.813 --> 12:14.066
It's already allotted for the moisture,
the color, the flavor.

12:15.025 --> 12:20.614
Today we're probably going to put
40 barrels of Indian honey in there,

12:20.698 --> 12:22.950
and mix it with a little bit of Vietnam,

12:23.033 --> 12:26.745
finish up with some Canadian honey,
then come up with the flavor profile.

12:32.501 --> 12:35.045
Your spec has got to be exact
all the time.

12:49.393 --> 12:52.605
[narrator]  Yes, the number of hives
worldwide is growing.

12:53.105 --> 12:57.193
But honey exports are rising
about eight times faster.

12:59.111 --> 13:02.490
[Norberto]  In some way,
there seems to be a surplus of honey.

13:03.157 --> 13:05.784
Where does that honey come from?

13:08.329 --> 13:11.332
If we consider that
the production is decreasing

13:11.415 --> 13:14.043
and the demand is increasing,

13:14.126 --> 13:17.922
the only way to explain that gap

13:18.589 --> 13:20.549
is honey adulteration.

13:21.717 --> 13:23.969
[narrator]  It's a simple but ugly truth.

13:24.803 --> 13:28.432
Lots of the honey flowing
around the world... isn't pure honey.

13:29.558 --> 13:32.686
[Norberto]  The dilution of honey
with cheap syrups

13:32.770 --> 13:37.191
is the main and more massive way
to adulterate honey.

13:38.943 --> 13:44.281
It is the reason of this apparent surplus
of honey all over the world.

13:45.407 --> 13:50.496
The most important point is to protect
consumers and what they are paying for.

13:50.579 --> 13:53.374
[ominous music]

13:55.626 --> 13:58.170
[narrator]  It's straight out of
the drug-dealer playbook:

13:58.754 --> 14:02.383
cut your pure product
with inexpensive filler

14:02.841 --> 14:04.385
to increase volume.

14:08.973 --> 14:10.683
[Norberto]  Ten or twenty years ago,

14:11.100 --> 14:15.312
syrups that came from corn
or from sugarcane

14:16.188 --> 14:18.357
were mostly used to adulterate honey.

14:20.401 --> 14:24.071
Around 25 years ago, in the United States,

14:24.154 --> 14:28.409
a method was developed
to detect that type of adulteration.

14:31.287 --> 14:35.040
And then, the Chinese
discovered some years ago

14:35.124 --> 14:39.670
that syrups manufactured from rice

14:39.753 --> 14:41.839
are not detected by this method.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.554
[narrator]  China,
the new agricultural powerhouse,

14:48.637 --> 14:51.974
is home to an ancient
and revered honey industry.

14:57.396 --> 15:01.984
By the late '90s, Chinese beekeepers
had close to seven million hives.

15:02.067 --> 15:04.486
A gigantic number by any reckoning.

15:05.529 --> 15:07.072
Between the huge hive count,

15:07.156 --> 15:09.950
and adulteration by some producers
with rice syrup,

15:10.784 --> 15:14.330
the Chinese honey industry
created a massive surplus.

15:15.664 --> 15:19.877
This overflow was then sold
to the world's hungriest honey importer:

15:19.960 --> 15:21.086
the US.

15:25.049 --> 15:28.719
[woman]  The Chinese were purposefully
undercutting the market,

15:29.219 --> 15:33.891
selling it at such a low price that
American producers couldn't compete.

15:38.228 --> 15:42.650
That honey may come in
at half the price of the domestic market.

15:46.028 --> 15:49.114
[Doug Schmitz]  There was a huge
import problem with really cheap honey

15:49.198 --> 15:52.117
forcing us American producers
out of our market.

15:52.701 --> 15:55.245
I couldn't find a market
for the honey I produced.

15:57.289 --> 16:00.167
[Tony Schmitz]  So there was an abundance
of honey on the US market.

16:00.834 --> 16:06.382
The US packers had all their supply needs
taken care of with these cheap imports.

16:08.717 --> 16:13.097
And it was hard as a honey producer
to compete with Chinese imports.

16:14.890 --> 16:19.228
The government felt it was important to
make sure that Americans could continue

16:19.311 --> 16:21.647
to raise bees
and sell the honey profitably.

16:24.108 --> 16:26.735
[narrator]  In 2001,
the US Government declared

16:26.819 --> 16:31.031
that Chinese producers were unfairly
"dumping" honey on the US market.

16:34.535 --> 16:37.246
[Susan Berfield]  They put
a huge tariff on Chinese honey.

16:39.248 --> 16:41.750
Basically triple the price
if it came from China.

16:45.045 --> 16:48.465
[ship horn blares]

16:54.054 --> 16:57.725
[Norberto]  As soon as those
anti-dumping duties were established,

16:57.808 --> 17:02.396
new ways to cheat the rules
were developed,

17:02.479 --> 17:06.775
for example, transshipment of honey
through third countries.

17:11.530 --> 17:15.367
[narrator]  Imports from
other Asian countries suddenly surged.

17:16.160 --> 17:20.748
Malaysia exported 37 million pounds
of honey in a single year.

17:20.831 --> 17:24.626
Not a bad haul for a country
where all the bees combined

17:24.710 --> 17:27.921
can only produce about one-tenth
of one percent of that amount.

17:31.759 --> 17:33.135
[Susan]  It's very simple.

17:33.218 --> 17:35.512
A barrel comes from China,

17:35.596 --> 17:37.431
they put a different label on it,

17:37.514 --> 17:41.226
they fake the papers,
and they send it on its way.

17:43.437 --> 17:48.358
[Norberto]  Consumers are eating
a product that is not honey.

17:49.651 --> 17:53.447
But that passes the official tests.

17:55.365 --> 17:57.785
[church bells ringing]

18:05.751 --> 18:08.045
[narrator]  Government testing is rare.

18:08.128 --> 18:11.548
Most lab work is paid for
by importers and packers,

18:11.632 --> 18:13.967
to make sure they're not selling
compromised honey.

18:15.385 --> 18:19.223
They turn to private laboratories
like Bremen-based QSI,

18:19.306 --> 18:23.268
which has been testing honey for quality
and purity since the 1950s.

18:26.105 --> 18:30.025
Germany is the second-largest importer
of honey, after the US,

18:30.109 --> 18:32.986
and German companies are among
the most powerful middlemen

18:33.070 --> 18:34.988
in the global flow of honey.

18:36.323 --> 18:39.201
Here we store all the samples
which we test.

18:39.284 --> 18:41.537
We store them in the meantime half a year.

18:42.913 --> 18:48.252
Samples from beekeepers,
importers, packers or retailers.

18:49.503 --> 18:51.922
Our clients need to label the origin.

18:52.589 --> 18:54.716
We also check dilution,

18:54.800 --> 18:59.555
and test for residues
from feeding the bees medicine,

18:59.638 --> 19:01.223
like antibiotics.

19:01.557 --> 19:05.060
Last year, we have got in total

19:05.144 --> 19:07.437
about 60,000.

19:09.940 --> 19:12.526
We have to taste and smell every sample.

19:13.402 --> 19:15.654
You can really smell, very strongly,

19:16.155 --> 19:19.741
like, a pine honey,
different from a light honey.

19:26.456 --> 19:30.335
A very, very weak floral aroma.

19:36.300 --> 19:37.885
[melodic percussion music]

19:37.968 --> 19:39.011
Hmm.

19:41.930 --> 19:44.641
[narrator]  Taste and smell
indicate authenticity,

19:44.725 --> 19:50.314
but to zero in on the country of origin,
the lab runs a pollen analysis.

19:50.981 --> 19:54.193
For every plant species or family,

19:54.276 --> 19:57.321
you have very specific forms of pollen.

19:57.404 --> 20:00.616
This is a sediment
of a Chinese linden honey.

20:01.700 --> 20:06.538
So you can see the typical shape
of the linden pollen.

20:06.622 --> 20:11.335
This is important for the botanical origin
and for the geographical origin.

20:14.296 --> 20:19.468
If you filter out the pollen, so you
cannot trace back anymore the origins,

20:19.551 --> 20:23.138
then you could mix or blend
this filtered honey

20:23.222 --> 20:26.808
and you would not be able
to detect it with pollen analysis.

20:35.567 --> 20:38.320
Every time a new test is developed,

20:38.403 --> 20:42.950
adulterators developed
a new method, a new product,

20:43.617 --> 20:47.996
to make possible
that the tests are cheated.

20:49.289 --> 20:53.835
It's like a competition from those ones
who want to adulterate the honey

20:53.919 --> 20:55.462
and those ones who detect it.

20:56.463 --> 20:58.757
In the very beginning,
if you apply this test,

20:58.840 --> 21:01.260
you see a high percentage
of adulterated honeys

21:01.343 --> 21:03.679
especially from the Asian countries.

21:04.930 --> 21:07.599
This might take two or three months.

21:08.850 --> 21:11.228
Then you see the positive ones decrease.

21:14.231 --> 21:16.817
It does not mean
that they stopped adulteration.

21:16.900 --> 21:19.778
It just means
they have found something new,

21:19.861 --> 21:22.656
which we cannot detect
with the methods we have so far.

21:24.199 --> 21:26.660
[narrator]  For years,
American producers complained

21:26.743 --> 21:30.122
that the tariffs on Chinese honey
weren't working.

21:31.915 --> 21:36.503
Cheap diluted honey was still being
shipped from China to third countries

21:36.586 --> 21:39.715
and then to the US,
killing American business.

21:42.217 --> 21:45.595
In 2008, the US government
did something about it.

21:47.639 --> 21:50.392
[man]  I started in
the US Attorney's Office in Chicago

21:50.475 --> 21:52.769
on January 7, 2008.

21:53.353 --> 21:55.731
Only a few months into the job,

21:55.814 --> 21:59.693
I had federal agents with the Department
of Homeland Security reach out

21:59.776 --> 22:03.947
and ask me for a search warrant
to search the offices of a company

22:04.031 --> 22:07.409
that I had never heard of before:
Alfred L. Wolff, Inc.

22:07.951 --> 22:13.498
[man]  Alfred L. Wolff is an international
import and export trade company.

22:13.582 --> 22:16.626
It's a family owned business

22:17.085 --> 22:18.837
with a long tradition in Hamburg.

22:23.675 --> 22:26.553
I was the National Sales Manager,

22:26.636 --> 22:30.223
trying to sell honey
within the United States.

22:31.600 --> 22:35.395
ALW was a pretty big, if not
the biggest importer of honey at the time.

22:37.189 --> 22:40.901
[Andrew] Large container loads of honey,
Russian honey specifically,

22:40.984 --> 22:44.571
was being imported into the United States
by the Wolff Company.

22:45.822 --> 22:50.285
Very large quantities of that honey had
tested positive as being Chinese honey.

22:51.995 --> 22:55.957
[narrator]  The agents dubbed their
investigation "Project Honeygate."

22:59.461 --> 23:03.465
[Andrew]  These series of cases,
which went from 2008

23:03.548 --> 23:07.135
until 2014 and 2015,

23:08.470 --> 23:13.016
ended up becoming the largest
food fraud case in US history.

23:14.810 --> 23:16.561
[tense orchestral music]

23:26.279 --> 23:31.284
[narrator]  In March 2008, federal agents
raided the Chicago office of A.L. Wolff.

23:35.622 --> 23:38.291
[Susan Berfield]
They come in fully suited, with weapons,

23:38.708 --> 23:41.586
ready to defend themselves
if it should be necessary.

23:44.381 --> 23:49.344
And they seized large volumes
of documents, shipping records,

23:49.427 --> 23:50.846
and electronic data,

23:50.929 --> 23:53.098
as well as samples of honey.

23:55.976 --> 23:58.645
[narrator]  Two Wolff executives
suddenly found themselves

23:58.728 --> 24:01.022
in a Homeland Security spotlight.

24:03.441 --> 24:07.279
Magnus Von Buddenbrock
was the US General Manager.

24:07.362 --> 24:10.031
The Head of US Sales
was Stefanie Giesselbach.

24:10.574 --> 24:15.245
[Berfield]  Giesselbach was hired by ALW
when she was 19 years old,

24:15.328 --> 24:17.622
and by the time she was 28,

24:17.706 --> 24:21.209
she was given what seemed to her
like a really great assignment:

24:21.710 --> 24:24.004
being transferred from Hamburg to Chicago.

24:24.963 --> 24:27.340
She was going to be
in charge of selling honey.

24:35.056 --> 24:37.767
[narrator]  In 2006,
Giesselbach arrived in Chicago

24:37.851 --> 24:42.731
and took over for the outgoing
sales manager, Thomas Gerkmann.

24:45.567 --> 24:48.570
[Thomas Gerkmann]
We had a transfer time of...

24:49.571 --> 24:51.281
four to six weeks.

24:51.364 --> 24:53.825
Sales is a people business.

24:54.201 --> 24:55.452
So of course,

24:55.535 --> 24:59.998
I took the opportunity
to say goodbye to the customers,

25:00.081 --> 25:05.086
and introduce Stefanie
as the new face to the customers.

25:05.170 --> 25:07.464
[tense music]

25:09.424 --> 25:12.219
[narrator]  Investigators believed
Giesselbach was a key player

25:12.302 --> 25:14.262
in Wolff's transshipment racket.

25:16.014 --> 25:18.683
And only a few weeks after the raid,
a tip came in

25:18.767 --> 25:21.228
that Giesselbach was skipping town.

25:22.437 --> 25:26.483
[Andrew]  She's broken the lease
for her car, cut off the utilities,

25:26.566 --> 25:30.195
she's purchased a plane ticket,
one way, to go back to Germany.

25:30.820 --> 25:36.243
It is very difficult to extradite
a German national from Germany.

25:36.326 --> 25:40.080
We really had
something like 24 or 48 hours

25:40.163 --> 25:42.207
to make a decision about her arrest.

25:45.335 --> 25:48.630
[narrator]  Agents pored over thousands
of Wolff company documents,

25:48.713 --> 25:53.343
looking for hard proof that Giesselbach
had knowingly sold illegal honey.

25:53.927 --> 25:56.554
With only hours to spare, they found it.

25:57.847 --> 26:00.684
It was called "Purchase Order 995."

26:01.977 --> 26:05.480
[Andrew]  PO 995 is
a purchase order for Polish honey.

26:05.563 --> 26:10.068
Lab reports indicated that
that honey was adulterated

26:10.151 --> 26:12.904
with a prohibited antibiotic
known as chloramphenicol.

26:15.031 --> 26:19.202
[narrator]  Chloramphenicol is not
an ingredient used to bulk up shipments.

26:19.703 --> 26:23.665
It's a powerful antibiotic fed to bees
to keep them healthy.

26:24.708 --> 26:27.544
It can be fatal for people
who eat it unwittingly.

26:28.545 --> 26:32.882
Which is why it is illegal in the US
to import food products that contain it.

26:35.010 --> 26:40.390
[Andrew]  After Ms. Giesselbach and others
knew that the honey was adulterated,

26:41.683 --> 26:45.228
they went ahead and sold it anyway
at a fire-sale price.

26:47.814 --> 26:51.151
[narrator]  The investigators had proof,
but they were almost out of time.

26:52.652 --> 26:57.574
Magnus Von Buddenbrock had just dropped
Giesselbach off at O'Hare Airport.

27:02.037 --> 27:03.788
[Boutros]  We are in the judge's chambers

27:04.581 --> 27:07.751
having a-- arrest warrant
and a criminal complaint

27:07.834 --> 27:09.753
sworn out against Ms. Giesselbach,

27:11.463 --> 27:14.841
and while we are doing that,
she was now at the ticket counter,

27:14.924 --> 27:18.636
checking in to get on her plane
to go to Germany.

27:24.559 --> 27:27.645
[narrator]  Agents grabbed Giesselbach
before she could board the plane.

27:28.521 --> 27:30.982
Her manager, Magnus Von Buddenbrock,

27:31.066 --> 27:33.443
was pulled over and arrested
minutes later.

27:34.152 --> 27:38.281
After two weeks in a federal cell,
both agreed to cooperate.

27:42.369 --> 27:44.412
[Andrew]  Ms. Giesselbach told us

27:44.954 --> 27:47.957
that 85% to 90%, she estimated,

27:48.958 --> 27:54.047
of the honey that Alfred L. Wolff
was bringing into the United States

27:54.422 --> 27:58.134
was part of some kind of criminal scheme.

27:59.886 --> 28:03.223
When I first heard it,

28:03.306 --> 28:06.184
I thought it couldn't be possible.

28:06.267 --> 28:08.353
It is a misunderstanding.

28:09.312 --> 28:12.399
[narrator]  But Giesselbach named
her co-conspirators.

28:12.482 --> 28:15.151
One of those names was Thomas Gerkmann.

28:15.610 --> 28:18.238
[Susan]  Stefanie, in her plea agreement,

28:18.321 --> 28:21.282
described a period of about two months

28:21.366 --> 28:24.828
that was pretty explicitly set up

28:24.911 --> 28:29.040
to allow Thomas Gerkmann to show her

28:29.124 --> 28:31.668
how the transshipping scheme worked.

28:32.043 --> 28:35.588
I was not an import manager,
I was National Sales Manager,

28:35.672 --> 28:39.551
so my job was to try to initial sales
in the United States.

28:40.009 --> 28:42.887
The import business was not my business.

28:42.971 --> 28:46.975
[interviewer] There are emails
that indicate that you were involved

28:47.058 --> 28:51.312
in deliberately transshipping
Chinese honey to the United States.

28:51.396 --> 28:54.858
What are your thoughts on these emails
and these allegations?

28:55.734 --> 28:59.612
Well, I don't know exactly
about these emails.

28:59.696 --> 29:03.616
I just know that the computers
of Alfred L. Wolff in the office

29:03.700 --> 29:05.326
were open to everybody,

29:05.410 --> 29:08.663
so signatures can be replaced.

29:11.875 --> 29:15.712
[narrator]  But there is one signature
that Gerkmann admits was not replaced.

29:17.839 --> 29:20.884
According to investigators,
purchase order 995

29:20.967 --> 29:23.887
directly links Gerkmann
to the honey laundering.

29:26.556 --> 29:29.392
[Thomas]  This issue, I remember quite well

29:29.809 --> 29:32.228
because I got a claim from the customer

29:32.312 --> 29:36.524
that the honey is contaminated
with an antibiotic.

29:36.608 --> 29:40.862
He made a test at a local laboratory.

29:40.945 --> 29:45.825
I sent this analysis to my US boss,

29:45.909 --> 29:49.579
as well as to the head office in Hamburg,

29:50.371 --> 29:52.957
asking what I should do with this claim.

29:53.041 --> 29:55.627
They came back to me, both of them,

29:55.710 --> 29:59.047
and said I should try to sell it

29:59.130 --> 30:00.882
with a discount to the customer,

30:01.299 --> 30:02.801
which I did,

30:02.884 --> 30:05.094
and then this case was closed.

30:05.178 --> 30:08.765
Today, I would say,
after knowing all this,

30:10.016 --> 30:13.019
I shouldn't have accepted...

30:14.562 --> 30:15.772
this instruction.

30:17.232 --> 30:20.819
[narrator]  Giesselbach was sentenced
to a year and a day in federal prison.

30:21.277 --> 30:24.989
Von Buddenbrock was sentenced
to six months' home confinement

30:25.073 --> 30:26.866
and three years' probation.

30:27.867 --> 30:29.702
Gerkmann was indicted,

30:29.786 --> 30:33.790
but living in Bremen, he was
beyond the reach of US law enforcement.

30:36.084 --> 30:40.880
The total number of individuals
and companies that were charged were 27.

30:41.589 --> 30:45.176
Of those 27,
9 defendants pleaded guilty.

30:45.677 --> 30:48.096
Ten defendants are fugitives.

30:54.769 --> 30:57.480
[Thomas]  I am a very religious person.

30:57.564 --> 31:00.650
And in the Bible, we have a saying.

31:02.902 --> 31:07.282
"People are thinking,
but God is showing the way."

31:07.365 --> 31:11.953
And this is how I'm living,
and how I try to live with it.

31:17.417 --> 31:19.043
The only...

31:19.586 --> 31:21.963
the only impact I have

31:22.046 --> 31:26.509
is that I'm not able to leave Germany.

31:29.679 --> 31:30.847
That's all.

31:33.391 --> 31:35.727
This was not a victimless crime.

31:36.436 --> 31:40.189
This was a crime
that impacted everyday people

31:40.273 --> 31:44.027
who were working
in the domestic honey industry.

31:44.110 --> 31:47.572
Honey producers, who were
just trying to make an honest dollar.

31:51.993 --> 31:54.037
[Clint]  It affects every beekeeper,

31:54.120 --> 31:57.081
because the consumer can
no longer trust the marketplace.

32:06.507 --> 32:08.051
Crime is dynamic.

32:08.134 --> 32:12.680
You cannot combat crime this year,
and forget it.

32:15.099 --> 32:18.770
[narrator]  Most honey-packers regularly
send out samples of their merchandise

32:18.853 --> 32:20.563
for quality testing.

32:20.647 --> 32:24.150
Although it's not required by law,
it's how they protect their business,

32:24.233 --> 32:27.278
by making sure they're not selling
a compromised product.

32:28.947 --> 32:32.450
We're buying honey
from about 11 different countries

32:32.533 --> 32:34.452
and too many suppliers to count.

32:35.787 --> 32:38.748
Every country has different known risks.

32:40.208 --> 32:42.502
Every time a truck comes to the dock door

32:42.585 --> 32:46.589
one of the first things we always do
is randomly pull some drums off the truck

32:47.090 --> 32:49.634
and get some testing on the way.

32:51.719 --> 32:53.846
Looks like some yummy honey, Tony.

32:56.975 --> 32:57.976
And there, like this.

32:58.059 --> 33:01.270
[Tony]  We're defending ourselves
against food fraud.

33:01.354 --> 33:04.899
So we don't associate ourselves
with any suppliers

33:04.983 --> 33:08.444
that are selling honey from Thailand,

33:08.528 --> 33:11.406
Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia...

33:11.990 --> 33:13.199
It's real low in moisture.

33:13.741 --> 33:15.576
That is some thick stuff.

33:15.952 --> 33:20.540
We have a very strong assumption that
Chinese shippers will use those countries

33:20.623 --> 33:23.501
as... we call them puddle points,
or surrogate countries,

33:23.584 --> 33:26.421
to circumvent their honey
through those countries.

33:27.505 --> 33:32.010
We're seeing shipments
that we don't believe are authentic.

33:33.428 --> 33:35.388
There's our sample right there.

33:35.888 --> 33:39.767
Our testing procedure
and our defense mechanisms

33:40.393 --> 33:43.604
caught a shipment of Vietnamese honey

33:43.688 --> 33:48.359
that we later proved
that was transshipped from Taiwan.

33:49.193 --> 33:54.282
Now, our quality control people
were doing their jobs

33:54.365 --> 33:56.576
and noticed that the paperwork

33:56.659 --> 33:59.746
and the tests that were sent
with that shipment

34:00.246 --> 34:02.206
just didn't match up with our tests.

34:02.290 --> 34:05.460
So we alerted the proper authorities.

34:05.543 --> 34:07.795
Customs and Border Protection Labs
concluded

34:07.879 --> 34:11.507
that the honey in fact was
of Chinese origin.

34:11.591 --> 34:13.760
[driving music]

34:16.679 --> 34:17.847
[narrator]  In recent years,

34:17.930 --> 34:20.558
the QSI laboratory
has developed a screening method

34:20.641 --> 34:22.560
that's much harder to beat.

34:25.104 --> 34:28.066
Nuclear magnetic resonance, or NMR,

34:28.149 --> 34:31.569
measures the magnetic fields
of individual atoms

34:31.652 --> 34:33.863
to create a kind of molecular fingerprint.

34:35.114 --> 34:38.951
These are cross-checked
against QSI's growing database

34:39.035 --> 34:41.120
of honeys from around the world.

34:43.790 --> 34:47.085
[woman]  I always describe it
as a perfect screening method

34:47.168 --> 34:50.838
because you see a lot
with just one measurement.

34:51.839 --> 34:54.133
With the green spots here,

34:54.217 --> 34:57.512
you can see that the models are positive.

34:57.595 --> 35:00.723
So the honey is coming from China.

35:00.807 --> 35:02.642
You see here,

35:03.184 --> 35:07.105
really good buckwheat honey
coming from the US,

35:07.188 --> 35:11.776
and you can see the high amino acids
here and here,

35:11.859 --> 35:15.571
and even the sugars
are perfectly fitting the red line.

35:15.988 --> 35:19.700
If you compare this
with the honey we just measured,

35:20.535 --> 35:22.078
doesn't fit at all.

35:22.578 --> 35:26.415
We can see it's really low here.

35:27.291 --> 35:29.210
This honey looks adulterated.

35:31.170 --> 35:33.548
We have a lot of syrup in the honey.

35:35.925 --> 35:37.760
[narrator]  For now,
it's an effective tool.

35:40.138 --> 35:43.558
But that doesn't mean the honey crooks
won't find a way to beat it.

35:46.018 --> 35:50.982
With money to be had, there will always
be fraud in the marketplace.

35:57.405 --> 36:00.658
We look at that and say,
"If I can't convince the consumer

36:00.741 --> 36:05.079
that I have a healthy and clean
and wholesome and good for you product,

36:05.163 --> 36:08.124
that I'm legitimately delivering
into the marketplace,

36:08.207 --> 36:10.501
then I've lost my source of income."

36:11.252 --> 36:14.255
My vocation is of no value if I lose that.

36:16.591 --> 36:20.553
[narrator]  At best, the value
of beekeeping is already in question.

36:21.345 --> 36:24.182
Beekeepers have had to push
their colonies to the limit

36:24.265 --> 36:26.017
just to stay in the black.

36:28.269 --> 36:31.063
[Lloyd Cunniff]  I started working bees
when I was 13 years old.

36:31.856 --> 36:33.649
I started working for my grandfather.

36:35.401 --> 36:37.528
1973, I guess it would be.

36:39.197 --> 36:43.409
We're lucky in Montana that our honey is
real high quality and highly sought after.

36:43.868 --> 36:47.622
We had a drought, and we had some problems
with colony collapse with our bees.

36:47.705 --> 36:51.709
So we went from a little under
a thousand colonies of bees

36:51.792 --> 36:55.129
down to... well, we had 489 colonies left.

36:59.842 --> 37:03.012
When a beekeeping operation
experiences numbers

37:03.095 --> 37:05.765
like 40, 50% loss
throughout the course of a year,

37:08.059 --> 37:12.647
the method that we use
to rebuild our operation is to split...

37:13.189 --> 37:17.026
creating an artificial hive
in a smaller unit.

37:20.196 --> 37:23.491
Taking one hive and making
three or four, or five out of it,

37:23.574 --> 37:26.035
depending on time of year
and strength of the parent colony.

37:27.620 --> 37:29.372
[atmospheric percussion music]

37:36.545 --> 37:37.630
[Buzz] How's it going?

37:37.713 --> 37:40.633
[worker] Hopefully she'll lay tonight
and we'll have two empty ones

37:40.716 --> 37:41.676
to clean up.

37:42.343 --> 37:43.469
[Buzz] Almost.

37:52.812 --> 37:56.732
[Buzz] Oh, you're in luck.
I found the queen on the first pull.

37:56.816 --> 37:59.777
She's going to be laying
all the eggs she can lay,

37:59.860 --> 38:03.364
you know, twice her body weight
in eggs a day.

38:04.365 --> 38:05.825
The bees will just feed her.

38:05.908 --> 38:09.745
She never stops laying eggs.
She can just keep on going in her prime.

38:09.829 --> 38:13.082
That can be about 2,000 eggs a day.

38:15.835 --> 38:19.714
So all the little bees here...
come from her.

38:23.217 --> 38:26.637
We put a new frame in
for her to lay eggs in every day.

38:38.357 --> 38:41.319
[Buzz] Those are the larvae there.
The bees are feeding that larvae.

38:42.570 --> 38:44.530
They put the food
at the bottom of the cell

38:44.613 --> 38:47.491
and that larvae is eating it all the time.

38:48.826 --> 38:51.370
When they cap it off
they're done feeding it,

38:51.454 --> 38:53.998
and that larvae
is then pupating into a bee

38:54.081 --> 38:58.127
and it will hatch out of that cell
as a bee ready to go to work.

39:00.755 --> 39:02.340
[bees buzzing]

39:05.843 --> 39:08.220
[narrator]  For the next month,
instead of making honey,

39:08.304 --> 39:12.016
these colonies will work
from dawn to dusk as pollinators.

39:13.559 --> 39:16.187
That's the other task
bees have evolved to perform,

39:16.270 --> 39:19.065
and it is suddenly immensely valuable.

39:24.278 --> 39:29.450
Back in 1990, California had about
400,000 acres of almond orchards.

39:32.244 --> 39:34.914
Now it has more than a million acres.

39:36.791 --> 39:39.710
[Clint Walker]  Almond pollination
is the key financial driver

39:39.794 --> 39:42.129
in the beekeeping industry right now.

39:43.547 --> 39:46.092
Honey is not paying the bills.

39:49.136 --> 39:53.182
Most beekeepers could not be profitable
producing honey alone.

39:58.813 --> 40:00.689
[narrator]  At around $200 per hive,

40:00.773 --> 40:05.361
a beekeeper can make tens of thousands
of dollars from their bees in a few weeks.

40:06.487 --> 40:09.490
Enough to keep their honey operations
from failing.

40:14.995 --> 40:18.707
[Lloyd]  Every one of those sticks
out there is a small almond tree.

40:19.708 --> 40:21.293
They just keep planting them.

40:22.420 --> 40:25.047
Guys are out there
working in the field right now.

40:26.674 --> 40:31.095
They just keep tearing out more... crops,

40:31.178 --> 40:32.596
and putting in almonds.

40:32.680 --> 40:34.140
There's such a market for them.

40:34.223 --> 40:35.808
I don't know how long it can last,

40:35.891 --> 40:38.561
but they got a lot of almond trees
planted in this country.

40:43.399 --> 40:46.026
[narrator]  Chances are,
it's going to last a while.

40:48.362 --> 40:51.991
Trends in healthy eating are driving
many consumers toward almond milk

40:52.074 --> 40:53.534
and almond flour.

40:54.493 --> 40:57.371
All of this has been a windfall
for the almond business.

40:58.956 --> 41:01.750
And those millions of trees
can't make almonds

41:01.834 --> 41:04.628
unless their blossoms
are visited by honeybees.

41:07.339 --> 41:09.383
[quiet buzzing]

41:17.683 --> 41:19.810
[Buzz]  We put in about 3,000 hives
into the almonds.

41:20.769 --> 41:24.440
At two hives an acre,
that does about 1,500 acres.

41:25.149 --> 41:28.027
So we're just inspecting the bees,
the colonies.

41:28.110 --> 41:30.905
We're feeding them because
it's been cold and wet.

41:31.780 --> 41:35.242
We supplement them with the sugar syrup.

41:35.993 --> 41:38.412
The almond trees
don't put out a lot of nectar.

41:38.496 --> 41:40.372
They do a lot of pollen.

41:41.081 --> 41:43.918
They're burning more calories
than they're bringing in,

41:44.001 --> 41:48.380
so they start using up their stores
rapidly, this time of the year.

41:48.464 --> 41:50.925
So the bloom is moving along
pretty rapidly.

41:51.008 --> 41:55.012
They will be here ten days to two weeks,
then we'll be moving them out.

41:59.225 --> 42:03.979
[narrator]  Nature usually provides enough
bees to pollinate any ordinary orchard.

42:05.731 --> 42:10.069
But thousands of trees
require bees by the truckload.

42:12.655 --> 42:16.283
There are about
two and a half million hives in the US.

42:16.659 --> 42:20.120
Every January, most of them
are loaded onto trucks...

42:21.539 --> 42:22.831
and brought here

42:22.915 --> 42:25.000
to pollinate California's almond farms.

42:25.084 --> 42:27.503
[mandolin and harp music]

42:33.133 --> 42:35.803
[woman]
A lot of beekeepers now are migratory.

42:39.306 --> 42:42.351
They come as far as Pennsylvania, Florida,

42:42.434 --> 42:45.396
to California, to pollinate the almonds.

42:47.606 --> 42:49.108
-[woman] Enjoy your stay.
-I will.

42:49.191 --> 42:50.943
[woman] How long
are you going to be here?

42:51.318 --> 42:53.279
-Probably today.
-Then home?

42:53.362 --> 42:54.863
-Then home.
-[woman] OK.

42:54.947 --> 42:56.282
Enjoy.

43:08.586 --> 43:11.505
Most large commercial
beekeeping operations

43:11.589 --> 43:15.593
feel that it's a necessity
that they migrate their bees

43:15.676 --> 43:19.805
to the Central Valley of California
in February and March, each year.

43:22.641 --> 43:25.894
[narrator]  This annual migration
may be saving the honey business,

43:25.978 --> 43:29.398
but it also puts it at very real risk.

43:33.444 --> 43:37.781
For one month every year,
much of the pollinating power in the US,

43:37.865 --> 43:41.535
crucial for foods
from apples to broccoli to strawberries,

43:41.619 --> 43:45.039
is brought to one tiny pocket
of the country.

43:45.956 --> 43:48.917
All the hives coming here is, like,

43:49.001 --> 43:52.087
bringing all the problems
from different places, you know?

43:52.171 --> 43:55.716
It's like bringing everybody
from the airport all into your home.

43:56.842 --> 44:01.555
[Lloyd]  Your bees come and get mixed
with bees from all over the United States.

44:02.139 --> 44:04.933
And you get too much livestock
in one area,

44:05.017 --> 44:08.312
and you can pass the diseases
back and forth amongst them.

44:10.606 --> 44:13.233
[Clint]
It's an intensely agricultural area.

44:13.567 --> 44:15.944
There are a lot of chemicals being used.

44:16.028 --> 44:19.698
There are fungicides
that are often sprayed in the almond grove

44:19.782 --> 44:23.077
during the time that the bees
are pollinating the almonds.

44:23.160 --> 44:28.040
It can be very deadly
for the honeybee colonies,

44:28.123 --> 44:30.751
and then even more costly
for the beekeeper

44:30.834 --> 44:34.380
who shipped bees across the country
to get them there

44:34.463 --> 44:35.964
to do the pollination job.

44:38.634 --> 44:40.636
[narrator]  In January 2017,

44:40.719 --> 44:46.141
beekeepers' fears about concentrating
so many bees in one place were realized,

44:46.225 --> 44:49.061
but not in a way that most had expected.

44:52.815 --> 44:56.527
I'm considered a honey producer.
I'm not really a pollinator.

44:58.112 --> 45:01.407
But prices of honey the last
couple of years, they started sliding.

45:03.033 --> 45:05.285
The reason we came to California this year

45:05.369 --> 45:09.665
was to make up for the short honey crop
that we had last summer in Montana.

45:09.748 --> 45:11.083
We didn't come last year.

45:11.166 --> 45:14.753
We stayed home with our bees and kept them
in a big building over winter.

45:14.837 --> 45:18.090
But this year we thought we'd try
to cash in on the pollination money.

45:20.342 --> 45:22.928
[woman]  I've known Lloyd
probably 30 years.

45:25.222 --> 45:26.682
Our agreement is that

45:26.765 --> 45:30.185
I would take care of his bees here,
place them in the orchards.

45:33.605 --> 45:35.149
They came in a semi,

45:35.524 --> 45:38.402
and we placed them
in one of our bee yards,

45:38.485 --> 45:41.947
and then he flew out and they started
what we call "working them."

45:43.991 --> 45:46.285
[Lloyd]  I'm medicating them
and feeding them syrup.

45:46.368 --> 45:48.078
I never have good luck with the bees.

45:48.495 --> 45:51.915
Their health, they seem to go backwards
when they get down here.

45:51.999 --> 45:54.460
This year was different.
The bees looked good.

45:55.836 --> 45:57.838
That first day we worked on half the bees.

45:58.464 --> 46:01.425
I went home that night,
called my wife back home,

46:01.508 --> 46:05.345
and told her that the bees looked good,
that we were looking good for the spring.

46:06.263 --> 46:09.308
They were superior.
I never had bees like that.

46:09.391 --> 46:13.395
Monday morning, Casey and I came out here
and we started working here.

46:13.479 --> 46:16.106
This was the first location
where the bees were sitting.

46:16.732 --> 46:18.901
There was 120 colonies of bees here.

46:19.651 --> 46:21.153
But they're spread out.

46:21.236 --> 46:24.323
The bees are dropped off
in these four different drops.

46:24.740 --> 46:26.992
There's 120 colonies in a drop.

46:31.288 --> 46:34.208
The next morning we came out
at 8:30 in the morning.

46:34.625 --> 46:36.335
A really foggy day, that day.

46:37.753 --> 46:39.588
We just drove down this road.

46:42.174 --> 46:44.676
I get a phone call from him
around eight o'clock

46:44.760 --> 46:47.137
and he says, "Where are my bees?"

46:47.221 --> 46:49.348
And I thought he was joking with me.

46:49.431 --> 46:53.769
I said, "You're pulling my leg."
And he said, "No. They're gone.

46:53.852 --> 46:55.562
They're not here anymore."

46:57.689 --> 47:01.735
[Lloyd]  And every place where they were
sitting the day before, they were gone.

47:03.195 --> 47:07.115
It is devastating because for him,
it was everything he had.

47:11.537 --> 47:15.082
Then she called the Sheriff's Department
and had them come out.

47:16.333 --> 47:18.752
So we just waited around here,
and while we were waiting,

47:18.835 --> 47:21.004
we got to snooping and walking around,

47:21.088 --> 47:24.758
and we found the labeling the Strachans
had put on the side of the hives

47:24.841 --> 47:28.345
that had their name
and their contact numbers and stuff.

47:28.428 --> 47:30.973
So when they came,
they peeled all the evidence off.

47:31.390 --> 47:32.766
They had time to do that,

47:32.849 --> 47:36.687
so it had to be
a pretty good-sized crew of guys.

47:36.770 --> 47:39.106
Probably at least four guys,
I would think.

47:40.941 --> 47:45.028
[narrator]  Lloyd Cunniff learned
that his bees were only the latest stolen

47:45.112 --> 47:47.489
in a string of hive heists
in almond country

47:47.573 --> 47:49.491
stretching back four years.

47:51.285 --> 47:56.164
[man]  Based on the information,
we believe that it's another beekeeper.

47:57.457 --> 47:59.668
It's kind of the perfect crime,

47:59.751 --> 48:03.213
because you have to know how
to handle bees and have the equipment

48:03.297 --> 48:06.008
to move and transport those bees.

48:08.760 --> 48:11.888
[Lloyd]  Just figure, an average honey crop
off of those colonies of bees

48:11.972 --> 48:14.016
would be over $100,000.

48:14.099 --> 48:17.519
Pollination money is obviously gone,
because I never did it.

48:17.603 --> 48:19.563
Somebody else got paid for it.

48:21.607 --> 48:25.027
The reason I wanted to tell this story
is I wanted to get the word out

48:25.110 --> 48:28.322
to try to save somebody else
from going through this.

48:30.240 --> 48:32.242
[birds chirping]

48:37.748 --> 48:40.542
[narrator]  In May 2017,
news outlets reported

48:40.626 --> 48:43.211
that police had found over 2,000 hives

48:43.295 --> 48:46.089
stolen from sites
in California's Central Valley.

48:51.261 --> 48:55.515
[reporter]  It wasn't the sound, but rather
the sight of these mismatched beehives

48:55.599 --> 49:00.228
that drew attention and ultimately helped
crack a massive heist.

49:01.063 --> 49:03.649
[narrator]  Police identified two suspects:

49:03.732 --> 49:07.110
Pavel Tveretinov and Vitaliy Yeroshenko.

49:08.320 --> 49:10.530
Tveretinov is a honey broker

49:10.614 --> 49:14.117
whose own pollination business
had closed two years before.

49:15.702 --> 49:19.247
Both men were charged with nine counts
of receiving stolen property.

49:22.501 --> 49:25.420
Police recovered 2,500 beehives

49:25.504 --> 49:28.799
worth an estimated $875,000,

49:28.882 --> 49:32.135
which had been stolen
over a three-year period.

49:33.679 --> 49:37.432
But even in the wake
of this bald-faced bee larceny,

49:37.516 --> 49:41.269
most beekeepers remained
helplessly hooked on the almond money.

49:43.105 --> 49:44.356
But not all.

49:50.278 --> 49:52.614
[Clint]  A few years ago,
we decided we would like

49:52.698 --> 49:56.410
to try to take ourselves
out of the pollination treadmill.

49:56.993 --> 50:00.205
We wanted to explore
a different business model

50:00.288 --> 50:02.124
where we could be closer to home,

50:02.207 --> 50:04.710
closer to our customer
that's buying our honey,

50:04.793 --> 50:07.254
producing honey more locally.

50:09.715 --> 50:11.842
And so about six years ago,

50:11.925 --> 50:15.345
we stopped going to California almonds
for pollination

50:15.429 --> 50:18.306
and the bees tend to be healthier
over the course of the year.

50:20.350 --> 50:25.230
People come to us for honey that was
produced by our bees on the honey farm.

50:26.940 --> 50:29.443
The customer we love
is the one we interact with,

50:29.526 --> 50:31.528
we get to educate about honey.

50:33.530 --> 50:34.740
[Clint] See them dancing?

50:35.782 --> 50:37.325
Here's one right here.

50:37.826 --> 50:42.289
She's trying to tell the other bees
what to go get, and what direction.

50:43.331 --> 50:45.792
-Look at that one.
-They dance.

50:46.209 --> 50:47.294
[boy] Does it change?

50:47.753 --> 50:52.507
It changes according to the direction
she is trying to send them.

50:52.591 --> 50:56.052
More of us are wanting to buy food
that we know the source of,

50:56.595 --> 50:59.890
that was produced
sustainably and ethically.

51:00.932 --> 51:02.934
Would you try our local wildflower?

51:03.018 --> 51:04.227
Sure.

51:04.728 --> 51:07.731
[Clint] This is what the bees produce
right here on the black land,

51:07.814 --> 51:09.775
a few miles from the shop.

51:12.903 --> 51:15.071
-Isn't that a nice honey?
-The one I want.

51:15.489 --> 51:17.949
-Can we have it?
-[Clint] Can you have it?

51:18.950 --> 51:21.661
You can taste any honey I've got.

51:27.501 --> 51:30.712
[narrator]  Between foreign competition,
honey adulteration,

51:30.796 --> 51:35.258
agricultural pressures, and outlying
crimes like the California bee heists,

51:35.342 --> 51:38.512
beekeepers can be forgiven
for worrying that their business

51:38.595 --> 51:41.014
may be too challenging to survive.

51:42.766 --> 51:44.267
[harp music]

51:46.978 --> 51:49.105
[Lloyd]
With the beekeeping industry in general,

51:49.189 --> 51:52.943
all the issues of transshipment
and adulteration

51:53.026 --> 51:55.237
really create a situation

51:55.320 --> 52:00.408
in which it's very difficult
for any beekeeping operation

52:00.492 --> 52:05.664
to be financially successful
as a honey-production-only model.

52:07.666 --> 52:11.962
[narrator]  And yet the romance of the bees
still works its magic.

52:12.504 --> 52:15.882
Many of those who make our honey
do it not for great profits,

52:15.966 --> 52:20.971
but because there is still an ancient
and serene mystery to the process.

52:23.390 --> 52:25.183
[Norberto]  When you speak to a person

52:25.267 --> 52:28.895
that doesn't know anything about bees,

52:28.979 --> 52:31.189
but you tell that you are a beekeeper,

52:31.773 --> 52:35.360
immediately that person
becomes interested

52:35.944 --> 52:39.197
and wants to ask more and more,

52:39.281 --> 52:43.827
and I think that is
the romance of beekeeping.

52:47.080 --> 52:50.208
In part it is a commercial activity,

52:50.792 --> 52:52.168
but in part...

52:53.378 --> 52:55.338
it's a way of living.

52:56.882 --> 52:58.633
[tense orchestral music]
