WEBVTT

00:06.080 --> 00:08.039
Clegane, look into the flames.

00:08.289 --> 00:09.580
What do you see?

00:09.581 --> 00:11.372
THE HOUND: A wall of ice.

00:12.456 --> 00:13.788
The Wall.

00:15.414 --> 00:17.079
The only thing standing
between us

00:17.080 --> 00:18.746
and the army of the dead
is the Wall,

00:18.747 --> 00:21.539
and the Wall hasn't been
properly manned in centuries.

00:21.872 --> 00:23.330
Last time we saw
The Night King,

00:23.331 --> 00:24.372
it was at Hardhome.

00:24.788 --> 00:27.621
Closest castle to Hardhome
is Eastwatch by the sea.

00:27.622 --> 00:29.382
TORMUND GIANTSBANE:
And that's where I'll go.

00:29.663 --> 00:32.205
Looks like we're
the Nightswatch now.

00:35.747 --> 00:38.581
ARYA STARK:
This suits you, Lady Stark.

00:39.539 --> 00:41.997
- Jon left you in charge?
- He did.

00:43.331 --> 00:45.080
(GRUNTING)

00:52.164 --> 00:55.039
- JAIME LANNISTER: Lord Tarly.
- I believe you know my son.

00:55.247 --> 00:56.705
Do you fight with us...

00:57.497 --> 00:59.663
or with the fallen savages
and eunuchs?

01:01.289 --> 01:03.038
DAENERYS TARGARYEN:
What do you think I should do?

01:03.039 --> 01:05.788
If you use them to melt castles
and burn cities,

01:06.122 --> 01:07.205
you're not different.

01:07.622 --> 01:09.289
You're just more of the same.

01:11.122 --> 01:12.456
MAN: Listen.

01:13.456 --> 01:15.414
(LOW RUMBLING)

01:34.663 --> 01:37.622
( theme music playing )

03:21.663 --> 03:23.622
( insects chirping )

03:25.830 --> 03:27.913
( gasps, grunts )

03:29.456 --> 03:30.622
( gasping )

03:33.788 --> 03:35.247
( grunts )

03:38.663 --> 03:41.621
( gasping )

03:41.622 --> 03:44.955
( coughing, panting )

03:49.622 --> 03:50.830
You could've killed me.

03:59.289 --> 04:01.288
The fuck were you doing
back there?

04:01.289 --> 04:03.580
Ending the war.

04:03.581 --> 04:05.787
Killing her.

04:05.788 --> 04:08.205
You saw the dragon
between you and her?

04:11.331 --> 04:14.205
- And?
- ( grunts )

04:20.954 --> 04:22.787
Listen to me, cunt.

04:22.788 --> 04:24.330
Till I get
what I'm owed,

04:24.331 --> 04:26.163
a dragon doesn't
get to kill you,

04:26.164 --> 04:28.038
you don't
get to kill you,

04:28.039 --> 04:29.497
only I get
to kill you.

04:32.622 --> 04:35.496
That was only
one of them.

04:35.497 --> 04:38.330
She has two more.

04:38.331 --> 04:41.413
If she decides to use them,
to really use them...

04:41.414 --> 04:44.038
- You're fucked.
- Don't you mean we're fucked?

04:44.039 --> 04:46.038
No, I do not.

04:46.039 --> 04:49.204
Dragons are where
our partnership ends.

04:49.205 --> 04:50.829
I'm not gonna be around
when those things

04:50.830 --> 04:52.581
start spitting fire
on King's Landing.

04:54.622 --> 04:56.080
I have to tell
Cersei.

04:58.913 --> 05:00.872
May as well jump
back in that river.

05:37.788 --> 05:40.163
( men shouting
in distance )

05:40.164 --> 05:42.080
( shouting continues )

05:54.122 --> 05:56.289
( Drogon screeches )

06:08.247 --> 06:10.913
( roaring )

06:15.247 --> 06:18.204
I know what Cersei
has told you.

06:18.205 --> 06:22.954
That I've come
to destroy your cities,

06:22.955 --> 06:24.204
burn down your homes,

06:24.205 --> 06:25.955
murder you,
and orphan your children.

06:28.788 --> 06:32.580
That's Cersei Lannister,
not me.

06:32.581 --> 06:34.787
I'm not here
to murder,

06:34.788 --> 06:36.538
and all I want
to destroy

06:36.539 --> 06:39.621
is the wheel that has
rolled over rich and poor

06:39.622 --> 06:43.830
to the benefit of no one but the
Cersei Lannisters of the world.

06:45.039 --> 06:47.288
I offer you a choice...

06:47.289 --> 06:49.621
bend the knee
and join me.

06:49.622 --> 06:53.787
Together, we will leave the world
a better place than we found it.

06:53.788 --> 06:56.787
Or refuse...

06:56.788 --> 06:58.289
and die.

07:09.205 --> 07:11.164
( snarls )

07:12.663 --> 07:14.622
( roaring )

07:27.289 --> 07:28.830
Step forward,
my lord.

07:37.997 --> 07:39.954
You will not kneel?

07:39.955 --> 07:41.331
I already have
a queen.

07:42.539 --> 07:44.038
Tyrion:
My sister.

07:44.039 --> 07:45.246
She wasn't your queen

07:45.247 --> 07:47.288
until recently,
though, was she?

07:47.289 --> 07:49.621
When she murdered
your rightful queen

07:49.622 --> 07:52.246
and destroyed House Tyrell
for all time.

07:52.247 --> 07:55.539
So it appears your allegiances
are somewhat flexible.

07:56.663 --> 07:59.580
There are
no easy choices in war.

07:59.581 --> 08:01.954
Say what you will
about your sister,

08:01.955 --> 08:04.455
she was born
in Westeros.

08:04.456 --> 08:06.705
She's lived here
all her life.

08:08.705 --> 08:11.538
You, on the other hand,

08:11.539 --> 08:14.288
murdered your own father

08:14.289 --> 08:17.413
and chose to support
a foreign invader.

08:17.414 --> 08:20.247
One with no ties
to this land...

08:21.872 --> 08:24.247
with an army of savages
at her back.

08:26.080 --> 08:27.913
You will not trade
your honor for your life.

08:29.913 --> 08:31.371
I respect that.

08:31.372 --> 08:34.413
Perhaps he could take
the Black, Your Grace.

08:34.414 --> 08:36.828
Whatever else he is,
he is a true soldier.

08:36.830 --> 08:39.078
He'd be invaluable
at the Wall.

08:39.080 --> 08:41.414
You cannot send me
to the Wall.

08:42.788 --> 08:44.414
You are not my queen.

08:57.872 --> 08:59.204
You will have
to kill me, too.

08:59.205 --> 09:01.080
Step back
and shut your mouth.

09:02.622 --> 09:04.038
Who are you?

09:04.039 --> 09:05.289
A stupid boy.

09:06.414 --> 09:08.621
I am Dickon Tarly,

09:08.622 --> 09:10.038
son of Randyll Tarly.

09:10.039 --> 09:12.246
You are the future
of your house.

09:12.247 --> 09:15.621
This war has already wiped one
great house from the world.

09:15.622 --> 09:17.497
Don't let it happen again.
Bend the knee.

09:25.164 --> 09:26.622
I will not.

09:30.955 --> 09:34.662
Your Grace, nothing scrubs
bold notions from a man's head

09:34.663 --> 09:36.246
like a few weeks
in a dark cell.

09:36.247 --> 09:38.912
I meant what I said.

09:38.913 --> 09:40.455
I'm not here
to put men in chains.

09:40.456 --> 09:42.787
If that becomes an option,
many will take it.

09:42.788 --> 09:44.164
I gave them a choice.

09:45.663 --> 09:46.996
They made it.

09:46.997 --> 09:50.163
Your Grace, if you start
beheading entire families...

09:50.164 --> 09:52.331
I'm not beheading
anyone.

09:55.497 --> 09:57.704
( roaring )

09:57.705 --> 09:59.164
Your Grace.

10:23.497 --> 10:27.038
Daenerys: Lord Randyll Tarly,
Dickon Tarly,

10:27.039 --> 10:29.704
I, Daenerys of House
Targaryen, First of My Name,

10:29.705 --> 10:32.829
Breaker of Chains,
and Mother of Dragons,

10:32.830 --> 10:34.663
sentence you to die.

10:38.247 --> 10:39.414
Dracarys.

10:40.705 --> 10:42.705
( both screaming )

10:55.747 --> 10:58.830
- ( man shouts )
- ( Drogon roaring )

11:23.913 --> 11:25.539
( door closes )

11:27.414 --> 11:28.955
My... my lord...

11:38.872 --> 11:40.456
How many men
did we lose?

11:43.039 --> 11:45.080
We haven't done
a full accounting.

11:46.788 --> 11:50.246
It's not only armies
that win wars.

11:50.247 --> 11:52.746
We have the Tyrell gold,
we have the Iron Bank behind us.

11:52.747 --> 11:54.414
We can buy
mercenaries.

11:56.331 --> 11:58.204
Not the same as our men,
but they'll fight

11:58.205 --> 12:00.413
if they're well paid,
which they will be.

12:00.414 --> 12:03.871
I just saw
the Dothraki fight.

12:03.872 --> 12:05.496
They'll beat
any mercenary army.

12:05.497 --> 12:07.580
They'll beat any army
I've ever seen.

12:07.581 --> 12:10.455
Killing our men wasn't war
for them, it was sport.

12:10.456 --> 12:12.662
Her dragon burnt
a thousand wagons.

12:12.663 --> 12:14.912
Qyburn's scorpion fired
bolts bigger than you.

12:14.913 --> 12:17.456
They couldn't stop it.
And she has three of them.

12:19.497 --> 12:21.413
This isn't a war
we can win.

12:21.414 --> 12:22.788
So, what do we do?

12:24.205 --> 12:25.456
Sue for peace?

12:26.788 --> 12:28.371
I sit on
her father's throne,

12:28.372 --> 12:31.038
the father you betrayed
and murdered.

12:31.039 --> 12:33.871
And in her mind,
she's winning.

12:33.872 --> 12:35.955
What sort of offer
do you think she'd make?

12:38.414 --> 12:41.829
Maybe we can count on Tyrion
to intercede on our behalf

12:41.830 --> 12:44.205
by way of apology for
murdering our father and son.

12:45.955 --> 12:47.455
He didn't.

12:47.456 --> 12:49.455
You saw the crossbow,
you saw his body.

12:49.456 --> 12:51.330
I'm not talking
about Father.

12:51.331 --> 12:54.871
Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey.
He had nothing to do with it.

12:54.872 --> 12:58.164
- After all this time, it still amazes me that you...
- It was Olenna.

13:00.539 --> 13:02.872
She confessed
before she died.

13:05.164 --> 13:07.413
And this was
before or after

13:07.414 --> 13:10.496
she drank the poison
you so kindly provided her?

13:10.497 --> 13:12.121
After.

13:12.122 --> 13:13.621
And you believed her?

13:13.622 --> 13:16.371
If you were Olenna,
would you rather have seen

13:16.372 --> 13:19.039
your granddaughter married
to Joffrey or Tommen?

13:21.414 --> 13:23.787
Which one would Margaery have
been better able to control?

13:23.788 --> 13:25.330
Which one would have
made Olenna

13:25.331 --> 13:28.038
the true ruler
of the Seven Kingdoms?

13:28.039 --> 13:29.913
She was telling
the truth.

13:37.289 --> 13:39.497
I shouldn't have
listened to you.

13:41.289 --> 13:43.079
She should have
died screaming.

13:43.080 --> 13:44.371
She's dead,
like her son,

13:44.372 --> 13:46.455
her grandchildren,
her whole house.

13:46.456 --> 13:50.038
And if we don't find a way out
of this war, we'll follow them.

13:50.039 --> 13:52.580
So we fight and die
or we submit and die.

13:52.581 --> 13:54.746
I know my choice.

13:54.747 --> 13:57.247
A soldier
should know his.

13:59.663 --> 14:04.247
( Drogon screeching )

14:24.581 --> 14:26.205
( roaring )

14:56.497 --> 14:59.414
( snarling )

15:01.705 --> 15:03.622
( snarling stops )

15:14.122 --> 15:15.830
( exhales )

16:01.747 --> 16:04.371
( screeching )

16:04.372 --> 16:06.538
They're beautiful,
aren't they?

16:06.539 --> 16:09.331
It wasn't the word
I was thinking of, but...

16:10.581 --> 16:13.330
but, yes, they are.

16:13.331 --> 16:14.829
Gorgeous beasts.

16:14.830 --> 16:16.746
They're not
beasts to me.

16:16.747 --> 16:18.580
No matter
how big they get

16:18.581 --> 16:20.746
or how terrifying
to everyone else,

16:20.747 --> 16:22.372
they're my children.

16:28.039 --> 16:29.371
You weren't gone long.

16:29.372 --> 16:31.538
No.

16:31.539 --> 16:33.538
And?

16:33.539 --> 16:36.247
And I have fewer enemies
today than I did yesterday.

16:38.913 --> 16:40.996
You're not sure
how you feel about that.

16:40.997 --> 16:42.705
No, I'm not.

16:44.622 --> 16:46.079
How many men
did your army kill

16:46.080 --> 16:48.080
taking Winterfell back
from the Boltons?

16:49.247 --> 16:50.621
Thousands.

16:50.622 --> 16:52.746
We both want
to help people.

16:52.747 --> 16:56.455
We can only help them
from a position of strength.

16:56.456 --> 16:58.539
Sometimes
strength is terrible.

17:01.747 --> 17:04.413
When you first
came here,

17:04.414 --> 17:08.163
Ser Davos said you took a knife
in the heart for your people.

17:08.164 --> 17:09.788
Ser Davos
gets carried away.

17:11.539 --> 17:13.246
So, it was
a figure of speech?

17:13.247 --> 17:15.580
( footsteps approaching )

17:17.747 --> 17:21.580
( speaking Dothraki )

17:33.788 --> 17:34.788
Your Grace.

17:40.830 --> 17:44.204
Jon Snow, this is
Ser Jorah Mormont,

17:44.205 --> 17:46.455
an old friend.

17:46.456 --> 17:47.954
I served
with your father.

17:47.955 --> 17:50.122
He was a great man.

17:51.663 --> 17:53.331
You look strong.

17:55.164 --> 17:56.496
You found a cure?

17:56.497 --> 17:58.455
I wouldn't be here
if I hadn't.

17:58.456 --> 18:02.954
I return to your
service, my queen,

18:02.955 --> 18:04.746
if you'll have me.

18:04.747 --> 18:07.122
It would be my honor.

18:24.122 --> 18:27.663
( ravens cawing )

19:38.830 --> 19:40.746
( ravens cawing )

19:40.747 --> 19:43.372
( panting )

19:46.581 --> 19:48.038
Ravens.

19:48.039 --> 19:49.872
We need to send ravens.

19:52.331 --> 19:55.079
I put very little stock
in it myself.

19:55.080 --> 19:57.538
Prophecies of doom
are never in short supply,

19:57.539 --> 19:59.746
especially
when winter comes.

19:59.747 --> 20:02.079
I remember Wolkan.

20:02.080 --> 20:04.455
A little timid,
but a sharp mind.

20:04.456 --> 20:07.954
Sandhu: Eh, the North has dulled
many good maesters' wits.

20:07.955 --> 20:10.163
Hard to say whether
it's the cold, the drink,

20:10.164 --> 20:11.954
- or the company.
- ( all chuckling )

20:11.955 --> 20:14.121
Sandhu: A crippled boy
claims to have seen

20:14.122 --> 20:16.246
dead men on the march
beyond the Wall,

20:16.247 --> 20:19.413
thanks to the magical help
of a raven with three eyes?

20:19.414 --> 20:21.079
Ebrose:
Yes, it is a bit much.

20:21.080 --> 20:23.788
- Still, we ought to write back...
- Sam: Brandon Stark.

20:27.289 --> 20:30.456
- The crippled boy.
- Do you know him?

20:31.622 --> 20:33.787
I led him through
the Wall years ago.

20:33.788 --> 20:36.954
I saw him go
beyond the Wall.

20:36.955 --> 20:38.538
And?

20:38.539 --> 20:41.455
Somehow,
a crippled boy

20:41.456 --> 20:43.538
survived for years beyond the
Wall when no one else could.

20:43.539 --> 20:47.289
Not the Night's Watch,
not the wildlings, no one.

20:48.913 --> 20:50.996
Perhaps we ought to listen
to what he has to say.

20:50.997 --> 20:54.121
Perhaps you need more scribing
work to discipline your mind.

20:54.122 --> 20:57.539
I sense a more detailed
proposal is forthcoming?

21:04.331 --> 21:05.539
( clears throat )

21:08.164 --> 21:12.163
Everyone in Westeros
trusts and respects you.

21:12.164 --> 21:16.330
If you tell people the threat
is real, they'll believe it.

21:16.331 --> 21:18.704
If you advise all the lords
to send their men north

21:18.705 --> 21:20.662
to hold the Wall,
they'll do it.

21:20.663 --> 21:24.163
And if you tell every
maester in the Citadel

21:24.164 --> 21:26.496
to search every word
of every faded scroll

21:26.497 --> 21:28.288
about the Long Night,

21:28.289 --> 21:30.121
they may find something
that lets us defeat

21:30.122 --> 21:32.039
the Army of the Dead
for good.

21:37.122 --> 21:38.331
It could be done.

21:39.747 --> 21:42.538
And this news
could be authentic.

21:42.539 --> 21:44.205
It's possible.

21:46.705 --> 21:49.038
It's also possible
that this message

21:49.039 --> 21:51.330
is part of a ploy
by the Dragon Queen

21:51.331 --> 21:54.288
to lure southern armies away from the
lands they are currently defending

21:54.289 --> 21:56.330
to open those lands
to easy conquest.

21:56.331 --> 21:58.038
Sandhu: That does
seem far more likely

21:58.039 --> 21:59.996
than magic birds
talking to cripples.

21:59.997 --> 22:02.538
Archmaester, please.

22:02.539 --> 22:03.705
It's real.

22:05.622 --> 22:06.705
I've seen it.

22:09.539 --> 22:11.038
We will write
to Maester Wolkan

22:11.039 --> 22:13.413
at Winterfell
for clarification.

22:13.414 --> 22:16.288
I promise you we will get to the
truth of it one way or another.

22:16.289 --> 22:18.996
- Archmaester, please...
- That will be all, Tarly.

22:18.997 --> 22:21.496
Maester: It brings to mind the
work of Jenny of Oldstones,

22:21.497 --> 22:24.121
the charlatan who claimed descent
from the children of the forest.

22:24.122 --> 22:26.912
- ( all chuckling )
- Sandhu: Don't forget the prophet Lodos,

22:26.913 --> 22:30.580
who promised that the Drowned God would
rise up and destroy Aegon the Conqueror.

22:30.581 --> 22:32.872
- ( all laugh )
- Ah, Lodos.

22:36.164 --> 22:40.704
Is he the one whose father and
brother were just burnt alive?

22:40.705 --> 22:42.662
I'm afraid so.

22:42.663 --> 22:43.912
Horrible business.

22:43.913 --> 22:46.538
I haven't had the heart
to tell him yet.

22:46.539 --> 22:48.580
He's a good lad.

22:48.581 --> 22:50.330
Right.

22:50.331 --> 22:53.246
The ravenry was falling apart
the last time I checked.

22:53.247 --> 22:54.997
( slurping )

22:58.456 --> 23:01.079
All rulers demand
that people bend the knee.

23:01.080 --> 23:02.289
That's why
they're rulers.

23:05.414 --> 23:07.413
She gave Tarly
a choice,

23:07.414 --> 23:10.246
a man who had taken up
arms against her.

23:10.247 --> 23:11.996
What else
could she do?

23:11.997 --> 23:15.121
Not burn him alive
alongside his son?

23:15.122 --> 23:17.455
I am her Hand, not her head.

23:17.456 --> 23:19.704
I can't make
her decisions for her.

23:19.705 --> 23:22.996
That's what I used to tell
myself about her father.

23:22.997 --> 23:27.371
I found the traitors, but I wasn't
the one burning them alive.

23:27.372 --> 23:30.122
I was only a purveyor
of information.

23:35.289 --> 23:39.330
It's what I told myself when I
watched them beg for mercy...

23:39.331 --> 23:41.912
I'm not the one
doing it.

23:41.913 --> 23:44.371
When the pitch of their
screams rose higher...

23:44.372 --> 23:46.413
I'm not the one
doing it.

23:46.414 --> 23:47.996
When their hair
caught fire

23:47.997 --> 23:50.871
and the smell of their burning
flesh filled the throne room...

23:50.872 --> 23:52.497
I'm not the one
doing it.

23:57.539 --> 23:58.663
( sighs )

24:01.164 --> 24:03.371
Daenerys is not
her father.

24:03.372 --> 24:05.787
And she never will be

24:05.788 --> 24:07.830
with the right counsel.

24:11.080 --> 24:13.497
You need to find a way
to make her listen.

24:15.955 --> 24:19.330
- Who's that for?
- Jon Snow.

24:19.331 --> 24:20.871
Did you read it?

24:20.872 --> 24:23.913
It's a sealed scroll
for the King in the North.

24:30.039 --> 24:31.497
What's it say?

24:32.581 --> 24:34.164
Nothing good.

24:40.663 --> 24:44.038
I thought
Arya was dead.

24:44.039 --> 24:47.121
I thought Bran
was dead.

24:47.122 --> 24:48.539
I'm happy for you.

24:50.913 --> 24:52.330
You don't look happy.

24:52.331 --> 24:54.704
Bran saw the Night King
and his army

24:54.705 --> 24:56.705
marching towards
Eastwatch.

24:58.289 --> 25:00.288
If they make it
past the Wall...

25:00.289 --> 25:02.996
The Wall has kept them out for
thousands of years, presumably.

25:02.997 --> 25:04.662
I need to go home.

25:04.663 --> 25:06.371
You said you don't
have enough men.

25:06.372 --> 25:08.954
We'll fight
with the men we have.

25:08.955 --> 25:10.580
Unless you'll join us.

25:10.581 --> 25:12.746
And give the country
to Cersei?

25:12.747 --> 25:16.580
As soon as I march away,
she marches in.

25:16.581 --> 25:18.912
Perhaps not.

25:18.913 --> 25:22.330
Cersei thinks the Army of the
Dead is nothing but a story

25:22.331 --> 25:25.580
made up by wet nurses
to frighten children.

25:25.581 --> 25:27.330
What if we
prove her wrong?

25:27.331 --> 25:30.747
I don't think she'll come see
the dead at my invitation.

25:32.039 --> 25:34.080
So bring
the dead to her.

25:35.539 --> 25:37.413
I thought that was what
we were trying to avoid.

25:37.414 --> 25:39.787
We don't have to
bring the whole army.

25:39.788 --> 25:41.829
Only one soldier.

25:41.830 --> 25:43.747
Is that possible?

25:47.581 --> 25:49.288
The first wight
I ever saw

25:49.289 --> 25:52.121
was brought into Castle
Black from beyond the Wall.

25:52.122 --> 25:54.455
Bring one of these things
down to King's Landing

25:54.456 --> 25:56.746
and show her the truth.

25:56.747 --> 25:58.787
Anything you bring back
will be useless

25:58.788 --> 26:00.621
unless Cersei
grants us an audience

26:00.622 --> 26:03.163
and is somehow convinced
not to murder us

26:03.164 --> 26:05.413
the moment we set foot
in the capital.

26:05.414 --> 26:08.996
The only person
she listens to is Jaime.

26:08.997 --> 26:10.830
He might listen to me.

26:14.830 --> 26:16.663
And how would you get
into King's Landing?

26:22.830 --> 26:24.662
I can smuggle you in,

26:24.663 --> 26:27.288
but if the gold cloaks
were to recognize you,

26:27.289 --> 26:30.496
I'm warning you,
I'm not a fighter.

26:30.497 --> 26:31.912
Well, it will all
be for nothing

26:31.913 --> 26:33.704
if we don't have
one of these dead men.

26:33.705 --> 26:35.079
Fair point.

26:35.080 --> 26:36.372
How do you propose
to find one?

26:39.788 --> 26:42.997
With the queen's permission,
I'll go north and take one.

26:44.705 --> 26:48.038
You asked me to find a
cure so I could serve you.

26:48.039 --> 26:49.663
Allow me
to serve you.

26:53.663 --> 26:55.163
The Free Folk
will help us.

26:55.164 --> 26:57.912
They know the real north
better than anyone.

26:57.913 --> 26:59.455
They won't follow
Ser Jorah.

26:59.456 --> 27:00.663
They won't have to.

27:07.705 --> 27:10.121
You can't lead a raid
beyond the Wall.

27:10.122 --> 27:12.746
You're not in the Night's Watch
anymore, you're King in the North.

27:12.747 --> 27:15.330
I'm the only one here
who's fought them.

27:15.331 --> 27:17.705
I'm the only one here
who knows them.

27:19.080 --> 27:21.080
I haven't given you
permission to leave.

27:23.913 --> 27:27.288
With respect, Your Grace,
I don't need your permission.

27:27.289 --> 27:28.497
I am a king.

27:30.122 --> 27:31.538
And I came here

27:31.539 --> 27:33.371
knowing that you could
have your men behead me

27:33.372 --> 27:36.580
or your dragons
burn me alive.

27:36.581 --> 27:40.996
I put my trust
in you, a stranger,

27:40.997 --> 27:43.996
because I knew it was the
best chance for my people,

27:43.997 --> 27:46.164
for all our people.

27:47.705 --> 27:52.039
Now I'm asking you
to trust in a stranger...

27:53.747 --> 27:56.247
because it's
our best chance.

28:11.497 --> 28:14.246
( all chattering )

28:14.247 --> 28:18.581
Glover: The King in the North
should stay in the North.

28:21.122 --> 28:25.496
We did not choose you
to rule us, my lady.

28:25.497 --> 28:28.331
- But perhaps we should have.
- ( all murmuring )

28:30.830 --> 28:35.621
The Knights of the Vale came
here for you, Lady Stark.

28:35.622 --> 28:37.080
Men: Aye.

28:41.539 --> 28:44.954
You are very kind,
my lords.

28:44.955 --> 28:46.996
But Jon is our king.

28:46.997 --> 28:49.538
He is doing what
he thinks is best.

28:49.539 --> 28:52.164
( chatter )

28:59.456 --> 29:01.496
Sansa: I warned Jon
this would happen.

29:01.497 --> 29:03.163
That he couldn't
leave the North

29:03.164 --> 29:05.996
and expect it to just sit
and wait for him like Ghost.

29:05.997 --> 29:08.371
He didn't. He trusted
you to hold it for him.

29:08.372 --> 29:11.164
Well, he's not making it easy.
The Northern lords are proud.

29:15.830 --> 29:18.121
These are Mother
and Father's chambers.

29:18.122 --> 29:19.663
And?

29:22.372 --> 29:24.704
Nothing.

29:24.705 --> 29:27.496
Don't do that.

29:27.497 --> 29:29.997
- What?
- Say what you mean.

29:31.663 --> 29:34.122
You always liked
nice things.

29:35.497 --> 29:37.830
They made you feel
better than everyone.

29:42.747 --> 29:44.330
Are you angry with me?

29:44.331 --> 29:46.662
They were insulting Jon,

29:46.663 --> 29:48.038
and you sat there
and listened.

29:48.039 --> 29:49.538
I listened
to their complaints,

29:49.539 --> 29:52.580
which is my responsibility
as Lady of Winterfell.

29:52.581 --> 29:55.538
Their opinions
are important to you.

29:55.539 --> 29:58.246
Glover has 500 men,
Royce has 2,000.

29:58.247 --> 30:01.204
Offend them
and Jon loses his army.

30:01.205 --> 30:03.205
Not if they lose
their heads first.

30:06.663 --> 30:09.829
Winterfell didn't just
fall into our hands.

30:09.830 --> 30:11.704
We took it back,

30:11.705 --> 30:13.662
and the Mormonts
and the Hornwoods

30:13.663 --> 30:15.121
and the wildlings
and the Vale.

30:15.122 --> 30:16.662
All of us,
working together.

30:16.663 --> 30:20.996
Now, I'm sure cutting off
heads is very satisfying,

30:20.997 --> 30:24.539
but that's not the way you
get people to work together.

30:27.705 --> 30:29.996
And if Jon
doesn't come back,

30:29.997 --> 30:31.954
you'll need
their support...

30:31.955 --> 30:34.079
so you can
work together

30:34.080 --> 30:36.038
to give you
what you really want.

30:36.039 --> 30:38.622
How can you even think
such a horrible thing?

30:41.331 --> 30:43.372
You're thinking it
right now.

30:45.372 --> 30:48.330
You don't want to be,

30:48.331 --> 30:50.622
but the thought
just won't go away.

30:56.539 --> 30:58.414
I have work to do.

31:02.080 --> 31:03.372
My lady.

31:07.913 --> 31:09.747
( door opens, closes )

31:15.414 --> 31:18.662
Last time I was here, I killed
my father with a crossbow.

31:18.663 --> 31:21.622
Last time I was here, you
killed my son with wildfire.

31:24.788 --> 31:27.621
There's a path to the left
that hugs the cliff.

31:27.622 --> 31:30.288
The guards
hardly ever patrol it.

31:30.289 --> 31:31.663
Too many steps.

31:36.539 --> 31:37.829
You're not
staying here?

31:37.830 --> 31:41.330
I've got my own business
in Flea Bottom.

31:41.331 --> 31:43.163
What if someone
takes the boat?

31:43.164 --> 31:45.456
Then we're fucked.
Best hurry.

31:50.872 --> 31:52.288
We don't have time
for this.

31:52.289 --> 31:54.455
We should be preparing
the city for a siege.

31:54.456 --> 31:55.621
The Dothraki
are coming.

31:55.622 --> 31:57.746
All the more reason
for you to train.

31:57.747 --> 31:59.746
Unless you plan on fighting
Dothraki 12-year-olds.

31:59.747 --> 32:02.288
Well, I seem to recall them giving
you a bit of trouble as well.

32:02.289 --> 32:04.288
And here I am,
ready to train.

32:04.289 --> 32:06.246
Why down here?

32:06.247 --> 32:08.079
I don't think
you want people to see

32:08.080 --> 32:10.996
how you look swinging
that thing yet.

32:10.997 --> 32:13.787
Today might be the day
I kill you by accident.

32:13.788 --> 32:16.331
Oh, you won't be
swinging it at me.

32:24.539 --> 32:26.205
I'll leave you
to it.

32:29.997 --> 32:31.331
I needed to see you.

32:32.788 --> 32:34.622
And I knew you'd
never agree to meet.

32:38.164 --> 32:41.121
You made me look
like a complete fool.

32:41.122 --> 32:43.413
I thought I'd surprise you
by hitting Casterly Rock,

32:43.414 --> 32:46.371
but you were
three steps ahead of me.

32:46.372 --> 32:48.954
Abandoned the family home,
completely unsentimental.

32:48.955 --> 32:50.455
Father would have
been proud.

32:50.456 --> 32:52.204
- Don't talk about Father.
- Listen to me...

32:52.205 --> 32:53.704
I once told Bronn

32:53.705 --> 32:56.539
that if I ever saw you
again, I'd cut you in half.

32:59.539 --> 33:02.039
It'll take you a while
with a sparring sword.

33:11.205 --> 33:13.121
He was going to execute me.

33:13.122 --> 33:15.829
He knew
I was innocent.

33:15.830 --> 33:18.163
He didn't hate me
because of anything I did,

33:18.164 --> 33:20.538
he hated me
because of what I am.

33:20.539 --> 33:23.705
A little monster
sent to punish him.

33:25.581 --> 33:27.787
Did he...
did he think...

33:27.788 --> 33:29.580
did he think I wanted
to be born this way?

33:29.581 --> 33:31.501
- Did he think I chose it...
- What do you want?!

33:37.997 --> 33:39.539
Daenerys will
win this war.

33:41.913 --> 33:43.330
You're
a military man.

33:43.331 --> 33:46.080
You must know there's
no way around that.

33:48.122 --> 33:49.704
Daenerys
is not her father.

33:49.705 --> 33:52.580
She's even willing
to suspend the hostilities

33:52.581 --> 33:55.080
if Cersei agrees
to certain terms.

33:56.247 --> 33:57.621
If you want Cersei
to bend the knee,

33:57.622 --> 33:59.079
you can ask her
yourself.

33:59.080 --> 34:01.456
I... I don't.
And Daenerys doesn't.

34:02.872 --> 34:04.581
Not right now,
anyway.

34:06.747 --> 34:08.996
She has a more
important request.

34:12.456 --> 34:14.621
( chatter )

34:48.496 --> 34:50.705
I wasn't sure
I'd find you.

34:57.997 --> 34:59.996
Thought you might
still be rowing.

34:59.997 --> 35:02.164
( chuckles )

35:03.622 --> 35:06.704
I looked in shops,
taverns, brothels.

35:06.705 --> 35:09.996
Should have known to come
straight to the Street of Steel.

35:09.997 --> 35:12.496
Aren't you worried
about the gold cloaks?

35:12.497 --> 35:13.912
Haven't been here
in years.

35:13.913 --> 35:16.330
Why should
they recognize me?

35:16.331 --> 35:18.997
Sometimes I hardly do.

35:20.663 --> 35:22.830
Nothing fucks you
harder than time.

35:27.622 --> 35:29.704
Anybody give you
any trouble?

35:29.705 --> 35:32.163
Here I am,
arming Lannisters,

35:32.164 --> 35:34.038
and I never get
a second look.

35:34.039 --> 35:35.538
But you were right.

35:35.539 --> 35:38.079
Safest place for me was
right under the queen's nose.

35:38.080 --> 35:39.580
Don't be so sure.

35:39.581 --> 35:42.497
Safety is never a permanent
state of affairs.

35:44.705 --> 35:46.247
Bad things are coming.

35:48.747 --> 35:51.704
You came to get me.
You want me to come with you.

35:51.705 --> 35:53.829
- Well, the thing you need to understand is...
- I'm ready.

35:53.830 --> 35:55.288
- You...
- Let's go.

35:55.289 --> 35:57.204
You should know
what you're heading into.

35:57.205 --> 35:59.204
What do you think
I've been thinking about

35:59.205 --> 36:00.580
with every swing
of the hammer?

36:00.581 --> 36:03.038
How happy I am
making weapons

36:03.039 --> 36:05.496
for the family
that killed my father?

36:05.497 --> 36:07.204
The family that
tried to kill me?

36:07.205 --> 36:09.330
( scoffs )

36:09.331 --> 36:11.580
I've been getting ready.

36:11.581 --> 36:13.038
I never knew what for,

36:13.039 --> 36:15.581
but I've always known
I'd know it when it comes.

36:17.247 --> 36:20.330
You might want to bring
one of those swords.

36:20.331 --> 36:22.247
I don't know much
about swinging swords.

36:23.747 --> 36:25.080
But this...

36:26.913 --> 36:28.247
this I know.

36:37.331 --> 36:38.746
Keep your father's name
to yourself.

36:38.747 --> 36:41.539
Situation's complicated
enough already.

36:42.913 --> 36:44.581
Well, who should
I say I am?

36:48.414 --> 36:50.829
I told you, Clovis, if we
don't get out of here soon,

36:50.830 --> 36:52.710
- someone's going to...
- Gold cloak: You there!

36:54.955 --> 36:57.289
No weapons, friends.
I promise.

36:58.497 --> 36:59.954
What can I do
for you?

36:59.955 --> 37:02.455
- Is that your boat?
- It is.

37:02.456 --> 37:04.871
- Gold cloak: The docks are that way.
- Davos: That they are.

37:04.872 --> 37:06.371
I try to stay
away from them

37:06.372 --> 37:08.622
to avoid good men
such as yourselves.

37:11.247 --> 37:14.621
- Still five gold dragons?
- ( laughs ) Are you joking?

37:14.622 --> 37:16.871
You must be even older
than you look.

37:16.872 --> 37:18.787
- 15.
- 15?!

37:18.788 --> 37:19.913
Apiece.

37:21.414 --> 37:22.955
- ( sighs )
- ( coins jingling )

37:28.331 --> 37:30.456
I can't say it was a pleasure
doing business with you.

37:32.955 --> 37:34.331
Gold cloak #2:
What's in the boat?

37:39.872 --> 37:41.038
Not more gold.

37:41.039 --> 37:42.787
- Wine?
- Mm.

37:42.788 --> 37:44.788
- I like wine.
- Or hams.

37:46.705 --> 37:47.830
Come have a look.

37:56.372 --> 37:58.288
- Fermented crab.
- What?

37:58.289 --> 38:00.163
Davos:
Fermented crab.

38:00.164 --> 38:03.163
One bucket of this triples a
brothel's earnings for the week.

38:03.164 --> 38:05.121
A man thinks he's done.

38:05.122 --> 38:07.704
He's ready to go back
to his loving family.

38:07.705 --> 38:09.621
But before he gets
his breeches up,

38:09.622 --> 38:12.996
his lady of the hour pops a tiny
spoon of that into his mouth.

38:12.997 --> 38:16.538
Five minutes later,
he's back in the race.

38:16.539 --> 38:19.039
Here, have a taste.

38:31.705 --> 38:33.580
I'd hurry to your
favorite establishment,

38:33.581 --> 38:36.079
or you'll put a hole
in that chainmail.

38:36.080 --> 38:38.372
( laughing )

38:42.747 --> 38:44.830
( chattering )

39:03.080 --> 39:05.080
Oi, dwarf!

39:06.414 --> 39:07.954
I really wouldn't
try any more

39:07.955 --> 39:09.996
until you see how
the first bite hits you.

39:09.997 --> 39:11.871
That dwarf...

39:11.872 --> 39:13.496
Where'd you get
that scar?

39:13.497 --> 39:16.038
Fish hook. Some men
you just can't teach.

39:16.039 --> 39:19.121
We was looking for a dwarf with
a scar like that a while back.

39:19.122 --> 39:21.163
Davos: Perhaps there's
some arrangement?

39:21.164 --> 39:23.580
( coins jingle )

39:23.581 --> 39:25.538
Arrangement?

39:25.539 --> 39:28.746
You gonna arrange to pay us
more than Queen Cersei...

39:28.747 --> 39:30.622
( grunting )

39:36.581 --> 39:38.288
- ( sighs )
- This is Gendry.

39:38.289 --> 39:39.788
He'll do.

39:42.497 --> 39:43.497
Go, go, go.

39:46.289 --> 39:47.787
Qyburn:
I could give you something.

39:47.788 --> 39:49.289
That won't
be necessary.

39:57.955 --> 39:58.955
Ser Jaime.

40:01.788 --> 40:04.456
- ( door closes )
- Why was Qyburn here?

40:05.872 --> 40:08.122
He's the Hand of the Queen.
Why are you here?

40:12.788 --> 40:15.331
I met with Tyrion.

40:23.205 --> 40:25.955
What did our brother
have to say?

40:28.539 --> 40:30.996
Daenerys
wants to meet.

40:30.997 --> 40:33.621
To discuss
her surrender?

40:33.622 --> 40:35.455
To discuss
an armistice.

40:35.456 --> 40:38.246
She's just won a great victory.
Why would she want a truce now?

40:38.247 --> 40:39.996
Because an army
of dead men

40:39.997 --> 40:42.539
is marching
on the Seven Kingdoms.

40:45.039 --> 40:46.871
Tyrion claims
he'll have proof.

40:46.872 --> 40:48.289
( chuckles )

40:50.747 --> 40:53.121
- Are you going to punish him?
- Tyrion?

40:53.122 --> 40:54.622
Bronn.

40:57.164 --> 40:59.538
He betrayed you.

40:59.539 --> 41:01.913
He set up a meeting without
your knowledge or consent.

41:05.747 --> 41:07.038
Do you think
anything of importance

41:07.039 --> 41:09.538
happens in this city
without me knowing?

41:09.539 --> 41:12.787
You let it happen.
Why?

41:12.788 --> 41:15.455
I've come
to believe that

41:15.456 --> 41:18.163
an accommodation
with the Dragon Queen

41:18.164 --> 41:20.704
could be in our
immediate interest.

41:20.705 --> 41:24.038
She has the numbers. If we want to
beat her, we have to be clever.

41:24.039 --> 41:26.205
We have to fight her
like Father would have.

41:29.663 --> 41:32.830
Dead men, dragons,
and Dragon Queens...

41:34.872 --> 41:37.871
Whatever stands
in our way,

41:37.872 --> 41:39.621
we will defeat it.

41:39.622 --> 41:42.413
For ourselves,
for our house,

41:42.414 --> 41:44.414
for this.

41:57.039 --> 41:58.621
Who will you say
is the father?

41:58.622 --> 41:59.913
You.

42:05.830 --> 42:07.080
People won't like that.

42:10.705 --> 42:15.121
Do you remember what Father
used to say about people?

42:15.122 --> 42:19.080
The lion does not concern himself
with the opinions of the sheep.

42:32.997 --> 42:34.955
Never betray me again.

42:40.039 --> 42:41.954
Davos:
We're leaving today.

42:41.955 --> 42:45.538
- The king's got a lot on his mind.
- I understand.

42:45.539 --> 42:48.121
He doesn't need to be thinking about
harboring the bastard of a dead king.

42:48.122 --> 42:50.580
- You don't have to worry.
- You're just Clovis,

42:50.581 --> 42:52.912
a smith who's come
to pay his respects

42:52.913 --> 42:55.912
before he heads off to work
at the Winterfell forges.

42:55.913 --> 42:57.912
Understood.

42:57.913 --> 42:59.371
- ( hammering )
- ( chatter )

42:59.372 --> 43:01.538
Begging your pardon,
Your Grace.

43:01.539 --> 43:02.996
You survived King's Landing.

43:02.997 --> 43:05.996
Yet again.
Your Grace, this is Clo...

43:05.997 --> 43:08.413
Name's Gendry,
Your Grace.

43:08.414 --> 43:09.996
I'm Robert Baratheon's son.

43:09.997 --> 43:11.122
Bastard son.

43:14.205 --> 43:16.662
He was meant
to keep that to himself.

43:16.663 --> 43:18.496
Our fathers
trusted each other.

43:18.497 --> 43:19.830
Why shouldn't we?

43:22.122 --> 43:24.621
I saw your father once
at Winterfell.

43:24.622 --> 43:27.830
I met yours
in my shop.

43:29.539 --> 43:31.872
- You're a lot leaner.
- And you're a lot shorter.

43:41.955 --> 43:45.746
I grew up on
stories about them.

43:45.747 --> 43:48.747
All I ever knew is that
they fought together and won.

43:50.497 --> 43:53.288
Ser Davos told me where you're
going, Your Grace, and why.

43:53.289 --> 43:55.079
Let me come
with you.

43:55.080 --> 43:56.954
Don't be a fool.
You're not a soldier.

43:56.955 --> 43:58.787
No,
but I'm a fighter.

43:58.788 --> 44:01.872
And he won't be needing a
smith with a sword like that.

44:04.289 --> 44:05.787
You know
how to use one?

44:05.788 --> 44:08.163
Well,
that's a problem.

44:08.164 --> 44:09.705
I prefer a hammer.

44:12.705 --> 44:14.414
He can handle himself.

44:16.205 --> 44:18.288
We could use the help.

44:18.289 --> 44:20.163
As my father
used to say,

44:20.164 --> 44:22.246
"It's better to be
a coward for a minute,

44:22.247 --> 44:24.496
than dead for
the rest of your life."

44:24.497 --> 44:26.912
I owe you my life.

44:26.913 --> 44:28.704
Twice over.

44:28.705 --> 44:31.954
But if what you said is true
about what's up there,

44:31.955 --> 44:34.414
I can't wait out
this war.

44:38.205 --> 44:40.121
Yeah, nobody mind me.

44:40.122 --> 44:44.163
All I've ever done
is live to a ripe old age.

44:44.164 --> 44:46.079
Man:
All right, come on.

44:46.080 --> 44:47.080
( grunts )

44:55.663 --> 44:57.912
Tyrion:
You may not believe it,

44:57.913 --> 45:00.621
but I've missed you,
Mormont.

45:00.622 --> 45:03.746
Nobody glowers
quite like you.

45:03.747 --> 45:05.039
Not even Grey Worm.

45:10.830 --> 45:12.787
This is the coin
the slaver gave me

45:12.788 --> 45:15.787
when I suggested he free us
and pay us, remember?

45:15.788 --> 45:19.622
It was supposed to last us
the rest of our lives.

45:24.080 --> 45:25.456
Take it with you.

45:28.122 --> 45:29.621
But bring it back.

45:29.622 --> 45:30.788
Our queen needs you.

45:40.164 --> 45:42.622
We should be better
at saying farewell by now.

45:44.289 --> 45:45.788
Your Grace, I...

46:03.205 --> 46:05.455
If I don't return, at least
you won't have to deal

46:05.456 --> 46:06.816
with the King
in the North anymore.

46:09.122 --> 46:10.997
I've grown used to him.

46:13.080 --> 46:15.705
I wish you good fortune in the
wars to come, Your Grace.

46:24.788 --> 46:26.456
Heave!

46:47.372 --> 46:49.580
( fire crackling )

46:49.581 --> 46:54.038
Gilly: Do you know how many
steps there are in the Citadel?

46:54.039 --> 46:55.246
No.

46:55.247 --> 46:58.205
15,782.

47:02.788 --> 47:06.205
Guess how many windows are
in the Great Sept of Baelor.

47:08.331 --> 47:10.871
None anymore.

47:10.872 --> 47:12.538
That's true.

47:12.539 --> 47:16.871
This High Septon Maynard,
he recorded everything.

47:16.872 --> 47:19.080
He even recorded
his own bowel movements.

47:22.622 --> 47:25.829
What does
"annulment" mean?

47:25.830 --> 47:29.704
It's when a man
sets aside his lawful wife.

47:29.705 --> 47:35.079
Maynard says here that he issued
an annulment for a Prince "Ragger"

47:35.080 --> 47:38.580
and remarried him to someone
else at the same time

47:38.581 --> 47:41.121
in a secret ceremony
in Dorne.

47:41.122 --> 47:43.038
Is that a common thing
in the south or...?

47:43.039 --> 47:44.414
These maesters...

47:46.289 --> 47:49.871
they set me to the task of preserving
that man's window counting

47:49.872 --> 47:52.163
and annulments and bowel
movements for all eternity,

47:52.164 --> 47:53.954
while the secret to
defeating the Night King's

47:53.955 --> 47:56.621
probably sitting on some dusty shelf
somewhere, completely ignored.

47:56.622 --> 47:58.538
But that's all right,
isn't it?

47:58.539 --> 48:02.621
We can all become slavering, murderous
imbeciles in thrall to evil incarnate

48:02.622 --> 48:04.246
as long as we can have access
to the full records

48:04.247 --> 48:08.289
of High Septon Maynard's
15,782 shits!

48:10.622 --> 48:12.247
Steps.

48:15.289 --> 48:17.414
That number
was the steps.

48:22.955 --> 48:23.997
( giggles )

49:39.372 --> 49:41.954
Are you sure
you want to do this?

49:41.955 --> 49:44.372
You always wanted
to be a maester.

49:45.997 --> 49:50.164
I'm tired of reading about
the achievements of better men.

50:08.414 --> 50:10.539
- ( whispering )
- ( horse whinnies )

50:29.414 --> 50:30.913
( dog barking )

50:47.913 --> 50:50.788
( quiet chatter )

51:19.247 --> 51:21.122
Wolkan:
I found it, my lord.

51:24.830 --> 51:26.538
It, uh, took
some searching.

51:26.539 --> 51:28.622
Maester Luwin's archives
are very thorough.

51:33.331 --> 51:35.954
You're sure this is the
only copy in Winterfell?

51:35.955 --> 51:37.830
Uh, yes, my lord.

51:42.622 --> 51:44.539
Lady Stark thanks you
for your service.

52:04.247 --> 52:05.913
( door closes, lock clicks )

54:16.663 --> 54:18.538
Tormund: Isn't it your
job to talk him out

54:18.539 --> 54:20.538
of stupid fucking
ideas like this?

54:20.539 --> 54:23.331
I've been failing
at that job of late.

54:24.955 --> 54:26.996
How many queens
are there now?

54:26.997 --> 54:28.330
Two.

54:28.331 --> 54:31.496
And you need to convince
the one with the dragons

54:31.497 --> 54:33.330
or the one who
fucks her brother?

54:33.331 --> 54:35.163
( chuckles )

54:35.164 --> 54:36.164
Both.

54:36.165 --> 54:38.205
How many men
did you bring?

54:41.289 --> 54:42.829
Jon:
Not enough.

54:42.830 --> 54:44.456
The big woman?

54:47.788 --> 54:50.580
We were hoping some of
your men could help.

54:50.581 --> 54:53.413
- Hmm.
- I'll be staying behind.

54:53.414 --> 54:56.538
I'm a liability out there,
as you well know.

54:56.539 --> 54:57.539
You are.

55:00.331 --> 55:03.539
You really want to go out there?
Again?

55:09.830 --> 55:11.581
You're not
the only ones.

55:15.205 --> 55:18.704
My scouts found them
a mile south of the Wall.

55:18.705 --> 55:20.581
Said they were
on their way here.

55:27.414 --> 55:28.872
You're the Hound.

55:30.872 --> 55:32.705
I saw you once
at Winterfell.

55:38.414 --> 55:40.580
They want to go
beyond the Wall, too.

55:40.581 --> 55:43.871
We don't want to go beyond
the Wall, we have to.

55:43.872 --> 55:46.038
Our Lord told us that
the Great War is coming...

55:46.039 --> 55:48.246
Gendry:
Don't trust him.

55:48.247 --> 55:50.205
Don't trust
any of them.

55:55.830 --> 55:57.455
They're the Brotherhood.

55:57.456 --> 56:00.038
And the last thing
their lord told them to do

56:00.039 --> 56:02.413
was sell me to a red witch
to be murdered.

56:02.414 --> 56:04.122
Jorah:
Thoros?

56:09.164 --> 56:11.246
I hardly
recognized you.

56:11.247 --> 56:13.455
Ser Jorah Mormont.

56:13.456 --> 56:16.413
They won't give me anything
to drink down here.

56:16.414 --> 56:19.455
I haven't been feeling
like myself.

56:19.456 --> 56:22.288
Tormund:
You're a fucking Mormont?

56:22.289 --> 56:24.413
Like the last
Lord Commander?

56:24.414 --> 56:26.621
He was my father.

56:26.622 --> 56:29.621
He hunted us
like animals.

56:29.622 --> 56:32.662
You returned the favor,
as I recall.

56:32.663 --> 56:34.330
( growls )

56:34.331 --> 56:36.954
Here we all are

56:36.955 --> 56:38.538
at the edge
of the world

56:38.539 --> 56:40.121
at the same moment,

56:40.122 --> 56:42.622
heading in the same direction
for the same reason.

56:44.456 --> 56:46.704
Our reasons
aren't your reasons.

56:46.705 --> 56:49.080
It doesn't matter
what we think our reasons are.

56:51.289 --> 56:53.079
There's a greater
purpose at work.

56:53.080 --> 56:56.371
And we serve it
together,

56:56.372 --> 56:58.662
whether we
know it or not.

56:58.663 --> 57:01.580
We may take the steps,
but the Lord of Light...

57:01.581 --> 57:04.954
For fuck's sake,
will you shut your hole?

57:04.955 --> 57:07.746
Are we coming
with you or not?

57:07.747 --> 57:09.954
Don't you want to know
what we're doing?

57:09.955 --> 57:14.371
Is it worse than sitting in a
freezing cell, waiting to die?

57:14.372 --> 57:16.371
He's right.

57:16.372 --> 57:18.372
We're all
on the same side.

57:20.872 --> 57:21.997
How can we be?

57:23.622 --> 57:25.705
We're all breathing.

57:33.622 --> 57:35.497

BERIC:
The first enemy and the last.

The enemy always wins.

And we still need to fight him.

You're scared, aren't you?
