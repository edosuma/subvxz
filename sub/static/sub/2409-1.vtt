(MAC AND KELLY MOANING)

00:43.320 --> 00:46.919
MAC: Okay, it's happening.
It's spontaneous.

00:46.920 --> 00:49.479
This... Who saw this coming?
I did not see this coming.

00:49.480 --> 00:51.799
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, let's do it.

00:51.800 --> 00:54.319
Okay. It's happening.
It's totally happening.

00:54.320 --> 00:55.479
BOTH: Whoo!

00:55.480 --> 00:58.679
What a twist.
Oh, yeah. Okay.

00:58.680 --> 01:00.479
This is so spontaneous.

01:00.480 --> 01:01.679
We're having sex one minute...

01:01.680 --> 01:03.159
Who knows what's
gonna happen next?

01:03.160 --> 01:04.759
Who knows what we'll be
doing in 10 minutes?

01:04.760 --> 01:06.919
- Okay.
- This is crazy!

01:06.920 --> 01:07.999
We're doing this on
the dining room...

01:08.000 --> 01:09.879
I've never had sex on a dining
room chair in my whole life.

01:09.880 --> 01:11.359
- (MOANING)
- This is amazing.

01:11.360 --> 01:12.639
I'm taking you to
Boner Town, bitch.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.639
- Don't call me "bitch!"
- Okay. I'm sorry.

01:14.640 --> 01:17.159
I'm taking you to
Boner Town, love. Okay.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.469
(CONTINUES MOANING)

01:19.480 --> 01:22.062
Baby? Baby?

01:22.320 --> 01:23.359
She's totally
fucking looking at us.

01:23.360 --> 01:24.599
Hey, baby.

01:24.600 --> 01:26.759
She knows what's happening.

01:26.760 --> 01:28.839
She totally knows
what's happening.

01:28.840 --> 01:30.839
(LAUGHS) She can't see anything.
She just sees shapes.

01:30.840 --> 01:33.759
She sees shapes fucking each other,
is what she sees. She can...

01:33.760 --> 01:35.639
She's fine.
She just sees shapes.

01:35.640 --> 01:36.719
It's like bouncing balls.

01:36.720 --> 01:38.319
My bouncing balls.

01:38.320 --> 01:39.959
- She's fine. She's fine.
- You know what?

01:39.960 --> 01:41.479
Let me turn her around.
Let me turn her around.

01:41.480 --> 01:43.599
Okay. Okay.

01:43.600 --> 01:45.839
Hey, sweetie.
Hey, little girl.

01:45.840 --> 01:49.559
Gonna turn around now.
Gonna look at the wall now.

01:49.560 --> 01:50.679
Let's go.

01:50.680 --> 01:53.660
Okay. There you go.
Love you, sweetie. Okay.

01:54.160 --> 01:56.199
Okay! Let's do it.

01:56.200 --> 01:57.359
We're back.
We're back in business.

01:57.360 --> 01:58.399
Okay. Okay.

01:58.400 --> 02:01.879
We are back.
It's happening. Okay.

02:01.880 --> 02:03.159
(BOTH MOANING)

02:03.160 --> 02:06.719
MAC: Oh, God. She keeps
turning... Turn around.

02:06.720 --> 02:09.079
Just look that way.
Just turn around.

02:09.080 --> 02:10.199
Why is she... Okay.

02:10.199 --> 02:11.679
I think it's over.

02:11.680 --> 02:12.759
We still did that.

02:12.760 --> 02:15.599
Oh, I'm sorry.
Okay. We still did that.

02:15.600 --> 02:17.559
Hello.

02:17.560 --> 02:18.719
What are you doing
in your Jumperoo?

02:18.720 --> 02:19.879
This never happened.

02:19.880 --> 02:21.719
- We're gonna finish that.
- We will finish that.

02:21.720 --> 02:23.559
FYI, we're gonna
do it in every room.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.559
And this time,
I'm going to ejaculate.

02:25.560 --> 02:27.319
Just because we have
a house and a baby

02:27.320 --> 02:28.959
doesn't mean that
we're old people.

02:28.960 --> 02:30.399
No. Fuck old people.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.079
Old people don't
fuck like we just did.

02:32.080 --> 02:33.719
Baby, I nearly came.

02:33.720 --> 02:35.239
This is like The Brady Bunch.

02:35.240 --> 02:37.479
I know! What's
nice about the house

02:37.480 --> 02:40.559
is that it looks like every
penny we have is inside of it.

02:40.560 --> 02:41.999
So, at least it looks like it.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.399
It's legitimate, right?

02:43.400 --> 02:45.425
- Neighbors. Hey.
- Hi.

02:46.760 --> 02:48.599
- Hey.
- Oh. Gay couple.

02:48.600 --> 02:50.439
- There's a gay couple.
- Gay couple.

02:50.440 --> 02:52.439
- They seem like a nice couple.
- They're so happy.

02:52.440 --> 02:53.959
- That's awesome!
- Dream!

02:53.960 --> 02:55.799
It is. Well,
it's the second dream.

02:55.800 --> 02:59.079
First dream, Taco Bell opens next door.
That would be fucking dope.

02:59.080 --> 03:00.759
- Hi!
- Hi!

03:00.760 --> 03:03.831
Hey. It's a fabulous
neighborhood.

03:03.920 --> 03:05.639
(STELLA CRYING ON BABY MONITOR)

03:05.640 --> 03:07.399
- Oh, she's awake.
- Really?

03:07.400 --> 03:09.159
- She's awake.
- Okay.

03:09.160 --> 03:10.319
- Okay.
- Uh... Well, bye.

03:10.320 --> 03:11.479
Okay. Bye. Love you.

03:11.480 --> 03:12.559
Love you. Bye.
Have a good day.

03:12.560 --> 03:13.639
Can I come?

03:13.640 --> 03:14.839
(LAUGHS) Kidding.

03:14.840 --> 03:17.661
No, we'll have a great day! We'll
have a great day. Okay. Bye!

03:17.800 --> 03:19.301
I love you!

03:20.280 --> 03:22.119
BILL: Uh-oh. Mac attack.

03:22.120 --> 03:23.239
MAC: Hey!

03:23.240 --> 03:24.319
Hey, there he is.

03:24.320 --> 03:25.439
Hey.

03:25.440 --> 03:27.679
I need that
Mendelson file by 4:00.

03:27.680 --> 03:28.959
Okay, yeah.

03:28.960 --> 03:32.279
And this is not your bro, this
is your boss talking. (CHUCKLES)

03:32.280 --> 03:33.879
I'll have it to you
by 3:30. How's that?

03:33.880 --> 03:35.439
- Mac!
- Okay.

03:35.440 --> 03:36.559
Mac!

03:36.560 --> 03:37.639
What?

03:37.640 --> 03:39.471
Wait. Hold on.

03:39.480 --> 03:40.759
Whoo!

03:40.760 --> 03:42.307
Okay!

03:43.560 --> 03:45.319
(PANTING) Oh, jeez, it's so far.

03:45.320 --> 03:49.999
Hey, we gotta go work on that
thing we were discussing.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.079
- What thing?
- What's going on?

03:52.080 --> 03:55.479
We have to go work
on that joint file.

03:55.480 --> 03:56.759
Of course. The joint file.

03:56.760 --> 03:58.199
You guys are doing a joint file?

03:58.200 --> 03:59.319
We have a joint file together.

03:59.320 --> 04:00.959
JIMMY: Yeah. We're pretty
deep into it. It's tight.

04:00.960 --> 04:02.839
- It's pretty thick.
- It's a big file.

04:02.840 --> 04:04.759
- Pretty fat file.
- It's dank.

04:04.760 --> 04:05.999
- We should blaze through it, probably.
- Yeah.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.319
Yeah, we gotta file that
for the THC Corporation.

04:09.320 --> 04:10.799
Okay.

04:10.800 --> 04:12.631
Because we are in the weeds.

04:13.840 --> 04:15.999
- How's Stella?
- She's a cute baby.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.039
It's nice.

04:17.040 --> 04:19.639
I think I realized for the first
six months, everything is fucked.

04:19.640 --> 04:21.079
- Everything changes completely.
- Yeah.

04:21.079 --> 04:23.799
You're like, "My life is over!
Everything's different!

04:23.800 --> 04:25.399
"Everything I could do,
I can't do anymore."

04:25.400 --> 04:28.359
But now, I realize that that's
all gonna go back to normal.

04:28.360 --> 04:30.359
- You sure about that?
- She can start drinking soon.

04:30.360 --> 04:33.159
They make these little strips that
test your tit milk for alcohol.

04:33.160 --> 04:34.519
She puts them on her tits?

04:34.520 --> 04:36.639
Yeah, she puts them on her tits.
Her tits are huge right now.

04:36.640 --> 04:38.159
- Are they really?
- But I can't touch them.

04:38.160 --> 04:40.079
She won't even let me see
them, is what's fucked up.

04:40.080 --> 04:41.159
- What?
- When we have sex,

04:41.160 --> 04:42.679
she leaves a wife-beater on.

04:42.680 --> 04:44.479
It's like having sex
with Tony Soprano.

04:44.480 --> 04:45.559
You're the goomah
in this situation.

04:45.560 --> 04:46.679
Yeah, it's fucked up.

04:46.680 --> 04:48.879
You are the only one of our friends
that has a house and a kid.

04:48.880 --> 04:49.959
Yeah.

04:49.960 --> 04:53.279
It's like you're, like, 10 years
older than everyone, you know?

04:53.280 --> 04:54.479
You're divorced.

04:54.480 --> 04:55.981
The point is...

04:56.200 --> 04:57.959
It's Jimmy time.
You know what I mean?

04:57.960 --> 04:59.599
And the girls,
when you're dating...

04:59.600 --> 05:01.039
- Yeah?
- Holy shit!

05:01.040 --> 05:02.999
See, we missed out
on the whole, kind of,

05:03.000 --> 05:04.919
sex-tech bubble,
you know what I mean?

05:04.920 --> 05:09.719
Now they got Sex Book
and Fuck Friends and...

05:09.720 --> 05:12.559
There's this thing called
Grindr, which is just...

05:12.560 --> 05:15.039
Your phone beeps when there's
someone horny near you.

05:15.040 --> 05:16.519
It's kind of amazing.

05:16.520 --> 05:19.466
It's mostly guys, but I'm gonna
find a girl pretty soon.

05:20.600 --> 05:21.719
JIMMY: You're up.

05:21.720 --> 05:23.039
Oh, oh! Oh!

05:23.040 --> 05:24.159
Hey.

05:24.160 --> 05:25.661
What are you guys doing out here?

05:29.720 --> 05:31.359
- There are the girls.
- KELLY: Hi.

05:31.360 --> 05:33.239
- How's it going, sweetie?
- Good.

05:33.240 --> 05:34.559
What's happening?

05:34.560 --> 05:36.159
There you go.

05:36.160 --> 05:37.959
She's excited to see you.

05:37.960 --> 05:39.919
Wait, wait. Hey.

05:39.920 --> 05:42.070
(BABBLES)

05:44.320 --> 05:46.519
Man, parenting is easy.
Look at that!

05:46.520 --> 05:47.919
Yeah, two hours a day.

05:47.920 --> 05:49.421
Yeah.

05:49.800 --> 05:53.279
This is delightful. This
is awesome, this thing.

05:53.280 --> 05:55.119
We should get one of
these above our bed.

05:55.120 --> 05:56.951
- (CELL PHONE RINGING)
- BOTH: Oh!

06:01.760 --> 06:03.599
- Hello?
- Hey!

06:03.600 --> 06:05.959
Oh, my God. You guys have
to come out with me.

06:05.960 --> 06:07.199
I haven't seen you in forever.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.599
Yeah. What's going on?

06:08.600 --> 06:11.199
Okay. My friend is spinning
at the Royalton tonight.

06:11.200 --> 06:13.159
There's a rumor that
Prince might perform.

06:13.160 --> 06:14.759
I really need to
get out of the house.

06:14.760 --> 06:17.719
I have not been out since
Jimmy and I got divorced

06:17.720 --> 06:20.399
and I really need you
there. Please?

06:20.400 --> 06:22.039
How do we do this? Do I
call the babysitter bunch?

06:22.040 --> 06:23.399
I don't know about that.
Let's just...

06:23.400 --> 06:24.799
- It's too late. We'll...
- Okay.

06:24.800 --> 06:26.119
Why don't you drop it
at the fire station?

06:26.120 --> 06:27.439
We can't leave her at the...

06:27.440 --> 06:29.079
What are you talking about?
That's not how it works.

06:29.080 --> 06:30.319
The baby drop.

06:30.320 --> 06:31.439
Okay. No.

06:31.440 --> 06:32.519
I'm kidding.

06:32.520 --> 06:33.799
What are you, like, having a baby,

06:33.800 --> 06:34.959
you, like, lost
your sense of humor?

06:34.960 --> 06:36.079
What are you doing?

06:36.080 --> 06:39.599
I am using the little box in
the Face Time to put makeup on.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.319
You're not even
looking at us, are you?

06:41.320 --> 06:43.999
No. Who looks at the other
people when they Face Time?

06:44.000 --> 06:47.239
Why are you guys not coming out?
Is fucking Jimmy there? Jimmy?

06:47.240 --> 06:48.799
No, Jimmy's not here.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.439
- We don't have a babysitter, so...
- Yeah.

06:50.440 --> 06:53.159
Hello. Fucking
bring her.

Yes?

06:59.680 --> 07:01.319
No. Yes?

07:01.320 --> 07:03.390
What are you doing?
What are you thinking?

07:03.920 --> 07:04.999
Let's just do it!

07:05.000 --> 07:06.639
This could be, like, a doorway to

07:06.640 --> 07:08.159
a whole new life,
where we have it all.

07:08.160 --> 07:09.879
- We have fun and a baby.
- That's fantastic!

07:09.880 --> 07:10.959

- I gotta get more shit. Okay.
- Okay.

You know what? She needs an extra
Onesie in case she craps herself.

07:37.920 --> 07:39.039
I think I better pump.

07:39.040 --> 07:40.239
- You gotta pump?
- I think I need to pump.

07:40.240 --> 07:43.639
She wants your necklace. Give
me your necklace. Now, go pump.

16:47.240 --> 16:48.839
See you guys around.

16:48.840 --> 16:51.079
Okay, thanks, man.
Dope. Cool.

16:51.080 --> 16:52.820
- Sweet.
- Yeah.

16:54.920 --> 16:56.759
I think we should
invite the old people in.

16:56.760 --> 16:58.039
They're old and lame.

16:58.040 --> 16:59.439
I mean, yeah, I like their baby,

16:59.440 --> 17:00.759
but this is no place for a baby.

17:00.760 --> 17:02.199
Yeah, I know.
But they're our neighbors.

17:02.200 --> 17:04.358
They can make our lives a living hell.
We need them on our side.

17:04.359 --> 17:06.942
If we're cool with them now,
they'll be cool with us.

17:07.240 --> 17:08.439
Hey, slow down!

17:08.440 --> 17:09.598
Hey, there they are!

17:09.599 --> 17:10.799
Where you going?

17:10.800 --> 17:11.878
Do you guys want to come in?

17:11.880 --> 17:13.439
You don't want us to come back in.

17:13.440 --> 17:14.598
I mean, no, we can't.
We couldn't possibly.

17:14.599 --> 17:15.719
No, no, no.

17:15.720 --> 17:16.799
Are you serious?

17:16.800 --> 17:18.319
- I think you should.
- Come on.

17:18.319 --> 17:20.439
- No, we've got the baby, so...
- We've got the baby. We can't.

17:20.440 --> 17:21.719
Come on.
Just real quick.

17:21.720 --> 17:23.358
You have the baby
monitor right there.

17:23.359 --> 17:24.559
We do, it's working.

17:24.560 --> 17:25.638
It works perfectly.

17:25.640 --> 17:27.199
You're, like, 10
feet away. Come on.

17:27.200 --> 17:28.279
Super quick tour.

17:28.280 --> 17:30.119
- Just the tour, maybe.
- PETE: Just the tour.

17:30.120 --> 17:32.599
- Just the tour. Cool.
- TEDDY: Oh, it's so exciting!

17:32.600 --> 17:35.148
Oh, yeah! Magic mushrooms!

17:35.280 --> 17:36.559
Slow down.

17:36.560 --> 17:37.879
What the fuck is gonna happen?

17:37.880 --> 17:42.146
I've been doing mushrooms since
before the fucking Internet existed.

17:43.240 --> 17:44.999
That's a weird phone!

17:45.000 --> 17:46.719
No, it's my baby monitor.

17:46.720 --> 17:48.159
You should look, you can see her.

17:48.160 --> 17:49.679
GIRLS: Aw!

17:49.680 --> 17:52.228
BOYS: Peekaboo!

17:53.840 --> 17:55.671
He's done.

17:56.560 --> 17:58.744
- Peekaboo!
- BOYS: Oh!

17:59.680 --> 18:00.759
(MONITOR BEEPING)

18:00.760 --> 18:02.159
Oh, no, no. The monitor
is not working.

18:02.160 --> 18:04.679
I gotta get back. Gotta
get back, gotta get back.

18:04.680 --> 18:06.159
I'm gonna throw up.

18:06.160 --> 18:07.991
BOYS: Whoa...

18:12.240 --> 18:13.679
I can't...

18:13.680 --> 18:15.039
Right there.
Yeah, yeah!

18:15.040 --> 18:18.759
No, no, no!

18:18.760 --> 18:20.864
(ALL HUMMING)

18:30.960 --> 18:32.879
Do you guys want to see
something amazing?

18:32.880 --> 18:35.199
Yes, I want to see
something amazing.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.199
- BOYS: Yeah.
- What is it?

18:37.200 --> 18:38.861
(LAUGHS)

18:39.200 --> 18:41.679
I know you're all wondering
why I brought you here.

18:41.680 --> 18:43.261
Behold.

18:50.680 --> 18:52.705
(ALL CHEERING)

18:56.720 --> 18:58.399
- Wow!
- Good job, man.

18:58.400 --> 19:00.231
Yeah, take a bow.

19:03.240 --> 19:05.359
MAC: (PANTING)
Wait. Wait.

19:05.360 --> 19:07.271
(BOTH SIGHING)

19:08.880 --> 19:10.079
Welcome to the lion's
den, my friend.

19:10.080 --> 19:11.319
Yes!

19:11.320 --> 19:14.079
This is my room.
Off limits during parties.

19:14.080 --> 19:15.919
This is where we keep
all the important shit.

19:15.920 --> 19:19.399
Alcohol, drugs, passports,
ping-pong paddles.

19:19.400 --> 19:21.199
Those things are always
fucking disappearing.

19:21.200 --> 19:22.999
Yeah, dude. My bros is
always stealing my paddies.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.159
Right? What the fuck?

19:24.160 --> 19:26.879
Holy shit! That's a
lot of fireworks.

19:26.880 --> 19:28.079
Can we light some of
those off right now?

19:28.080 --> 19:29.239
No.

19:29.240 --> 19:33.079
Man, literally, the last time we lit
those off, we burned the house down.

19:33.080 --> 19:34.359
(CHUCKLING)

19:34.360 --> 19:37.227
It's not funny.
That was really bad.

19:37.840 --> 19:39.679
Check this out.
Watch the yard.

19:39.680 --> 19:41.261
- Ready?
- Yeah.

19:42.720 --> 19:44.506
(ALL CHEERING)

19:44.760 --> 19:46.079
That's awesome.

19:46.080 --> 19:47.759
Welcome to paradise.

19:47.760 --> 19:48.919
Hey, who's Batman to you?

19:48.920 --> 19:51.199
Like, when you think of
Batman, who's Batman?

19:51.200 --> 19:52.279
Are you kidding me?

19:52.280 --> 19:53.679
- Christian Bale?
- Christian Bale.

19:53.680 --> 19:55.944
Michael Keaton is Batman to me.

19:56.080 --> 19:57.911
(IMITATING BALE AS BATMAN)
"Where is she?"

19:58.040 --> 20:00.799
(LAUGHS)
Michael Keaton's Batman was like,

20:00.800 --> 20:02.559
(IN RASPY VOICE)
"Hey, I'm Batman."

20:02.560 --> 20:05.079
"No! Hey, I'm Batman!"

20:05.080 --> 20:08.479
"No, dude, no. I'm Batman. This
is what Batman sounds like."

20:08.480 --> 20:09.879
"I'm counting on it!"

20:09.880 --> 20:11.599
"No, I'm counting on it.
I'm Batman."

20:11.600 --> 20:13.719
We actually met
in college. Yeah.

20:13.720 --> 20:14.919
GIRLS: Aw!

20:14.920 --> 20:17.359
Yeah, I was here for
an exchange program.

20:17.360 --> 20:20.439
I was only supposed
to stay a semester,

20:20.440 --> 20:23.439
but then he convinced me
to hang around.

20:23.440 --> 20:24.479
- ALL: Aw!
- Yeah.

20:24.480 --> 20:26.479
What's cool is we're
almost roommates.

20:26.480 --> 20:27.679
Dude, we are almost roommates.

20:27.680 --> 20:29.319
Our rooms are, like, 10
feet away from each other.

20:29.320 --> 20:30.559
Dude, we can have
walkie-talkies,

20:30.560 --> 20:31.759
- actually.
- (GASPS)

20:31.760 --> 20:33.199
It would just work all the time.
It would be awesome.

20:33.200 --> 20:35.799
Let's get walkie-talkies and
talk to each other all the time.

20:35.800 --> 20:37.559
- Walkie-talkies and earpieces and shit.
- Oh, my God.

20:37.560 --> 20:38.719
That would be so dope.

20:38.720 --> 20:39.839
It'd be so fun.

20:39.840 --> 20:41.959
So, how did you meet Teddy?

20:41.960 --> 20:44.542
I saw him.
He saw me.

20:44.840 --> 20:46.479
Yeah.

20:46.480 --> 20:48.399
It's a really romantic story.

20:48.400 --> 20:51.919
Hold on to this moment,
man. Seriously, enjoy this.

20:51.920 --> 20:54.599
Because soon, you fucking blink,

20:54.600 --> 20:57.279
and you're the oldest
guy at the party,

20:57.280 --> 20:59.599
and it's terrible.

20:59.600 --> 21:01.439
You don't seem old.

21:01.440 --> 21:04.341
You seem like a senior
that took a year abroad.

21:07.520 --> 21:09.863
- Really?
- Yeah, man.

21:10.480 --> 21:12.345
Bottom of my heart.

21:12.920 --> 21:14.865
You want to swordfight?

21:15.240 --> 21:17.071
Absolutely.

21:20.240 --> 21:22.071
ALL: Aw!

21:25.040 --> 21:27.239
MAC: Epic night!

21:27.240 --> 21:29.479
Crazy! I owe you, man.

21:29.480 --> 21:31.039
- KELLY: I really needed that.
- MAC: Thank you so much.

21:31.040 --> 21:32.959
Yeah, again,
if you can just generally

21:32.960 --> 21:34.799
kind of, you know, keep it down.

21:34.800 --> 21:35.959
Just keep it down.

21:35.960 --> 21:37.319
- Just keep it down.
- Low.

21:37.320 --> 21:39.599
That would be... That would be
fucking... That would be trill.

21:39.600 --> 21:40.879
You really want us
to keep it down?

21:40.880 --> 21:42.079
Yeah, like, every night.

21:42.080 --> 21:43.759
Yeah, try to keep it down.

21:43.760 --> 21:45.759
I'll give it the old college try.

21:45.760 --> 21:46.999
- Nice! That was good.
- Nice.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.359
- Cool, cool.
- How is that?

21:48.360 --> 21:51.279
Just make sure if we're too
noisy, you call me first.

21:51.280 --> 21:52.599
Don't call the cops, okay?

21:52.600 --> 21:53.759
- Okay. Yeah, for sure.
- Yeah.

21:53.760 --> 21:55.119
- Do you promise?
- I promise.

21:55.120 --> 21:56.399
Do you promise?

21:56.400 --> 21:57.639
I promise. We promise.

21:57.640 --> 22:00.719
You promise? Okay. Because a
promise is a big deal to me.

22:00.720 --> 22:02.199
- Okay.
- Okay.

22:02.200 --> 22:04.359
- We promise.
- Thank you so much, guys.

22:04.360 --> 22:07.279
I hope you guys come over and
try and hang with us some more.

22:07.280 --> 22:08.759
- Yeah, dope, dope. Cool.
- It was a good time.

22:08.760 --> 22:09.999
I'll go tell them to shh!

22:10.000 --> 22:11.159
MAC: Yeah.

22:11.160 --> 22:12.599
See you guys.

22:12.600 --> 22:14.386
Great night!

(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING)

22:20.800 --> 22:24.439
Hey, Teddy. It's Mac again.
Your neighbor.

22:24.440 --> 22:26.879
You said to call if
it was ever too loud.

22:26.880 --> 22:28.399
So, we're calling.
It's too loud.

22:28.400 --> 22:29.839
Can you please keep it down?

22:29.840 --> 22:33.279
It's 4:00 in the morning, our
baby's awake. She's freaking out.

22:33.280 --> 22:34.519
Thank you.

22:34.520 --> 22:35.679
Ten times.

22:35.680 --> 22:37.599
I've called him ten times.
What do we do?

22:37.600 --> 22:39.439
If we actually go over there
and tell them to keep it down,

22:39.440 --> 22:40.479
we're gonna seem so lame.

22:40.480 --> 22:41.559
We're gonna have to call the cops.

22:41.560 --> 22:42.599
- We call the cops?
- Yes.

22:42.600 --> 22:44.599
He told us not to call the cops.

22:44.600 --> 22:45.839
Do it anonymously.

22:45.840 --> 22:47.079
They do our dirty work for us.

22:47.080 --> 22:50.439
We're cool, they shut up,
she goes to sleep. Done.

- It's a good system.

- Let's do it. Okay, I'm doing it.
- Let's do it.

Here they are.

Okay.

23:05.120 --> 23:08.351
I feel so lame. I can't
believe we called the cops.

23:10.600 --> 23:11.879
They can't tell it's us.

23:11.880 --> 23:13.719
They don't know it was us.
Could've been anyone.

23:13.720 --> 23:14.959
- Could have been anyone.
- Any one of these people could have called.

23:14.960 --> 23:16.439
We're not gonna
get caught for this.

23:16.440 --> 23:19.944
Anyone would do this.
This isn't because we're old.

- Oh!

- One moment.

Yeah. What's happening?

23:53.880 --> 23:55.950
You called about your neighbors?

No.

Radner. That's you. Right?

24:02.200 --> 24:04.359
Yeah. How do you
have that information?

We have caller ID.
We're cops.

Okay, yes.

24:10.920 --> 24:12.959
You called us.
Why did you call us?

24:12.960 --> 24:16.359
I called the cops because
you were being noisy, man.

24:16.360 --> 24:18.039
And I tried to get you to
stop, and you wouldn't stop.

24:18.040 --> 24:19.199
They won't stop partying!

- We have a baby.

24:22.880 --> 24:24.839
- Mac's working in the morning.
- We got jobs.

24:24.840 --> 24:26.679
They were at the party
with us just last night.

24:26.680 --> 24:28.719
- Did you party with this kid?
- We don't party with them!

24:28.720 --> 24:30.759
We shouldn't be in trouble. We
haven't done anything wrong.

24:30.760 --> 24:31.879
We have a baby.
We're parents.

24:31.880 --> 24:33.984
Well then, what do you call these?

24:34.040 --> 24:37.599
I'm too fucked up!
Ahhh! Ahhh!

guys were partying with him.

24:39.560 --> 24:40.839
You party pretty heavy.

24:40.840 --> 24:43.199
That's a joke photo!

24:43.200 --> 24:44.399
- It's a joke?
- That's a joke!

24:44.400 --> 24:45.679
It's not a good joke.

24:45.680 --> 24:46.999
Okay, you know what?
Let's end this.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.039
I'm sorry.
I rescind the complaint.

24:49.040 --> 24:51.159
You can go.
No noise complaint.

24:51.160 --> 24:53.199
You know the boy who cried wolf?

24:53.200 --> 24:54.399
You're that boy.

24:54.400 --> 24:56.559
- Okay, I cried wolf.
- Never call us again.

24:56.560 --> 24:59.108
Never call you again?
You're the fucking police.

25:00.360 --> 25:01.599
Look, man, we're sorry.

25:01.600 --> 25:02.759
You were being noisy.

25:02.760 --> 25:04.319
We tried to call you.
I don't know what to say.

25:04.320 --> 25:06.079
We called you five times,
you didn't answer us.

25:06.080 --> 25:07.759
You made a promise
to me last night.

25:07.760 --> 25:10.159
We were pissing.
We crossed streams.

25:10.160 --> 25:11.759
Don't worry about it, you know?

25:11.760 --> 25:14.319
"Hey, I'm Batman."
You know? Right?

25:14.320 --> 25:15.559
No, we're done with that, bro.

25:15.560 --> 25:17.359
- We're still cool, man. We're still cool.
- We're sorry.

25:17.360 --> 25:19.199
I'm not mad.

25:19.200 --> 25:21.279
I'm just disappointed.

25:21.280 --> 25:23.748
Hey, come on.
Wait, let's just...

25:26.640 --> 25:28.301
MAC: What's that?

25:28.640 --> 25:29.959
Those are for you.

25:29.960 --> 25:31.679
What the fuck?

25:31.680 --> 25:33.420
Oh.

25:35.720 --> 25:37.639
TEDDY: You shouldn't have
called the cops, bro!

25:37.640 --> 25:39.426
Okay.

25:39.760 --> 25:41.719
- (ALL SHOUTING)
- Okay, very good.

25:41.720 --> 25:42.799
Very good.

25:42.800 --> 25:44.559
- KELLY: Okay.
- Congratulations.

25:44.560 --> 25:46.159
You better put that
in the recycling bin.

25:46.160 --> 25:47.661
- All Of it.
- All Of it.

25:49.720 --> 25:51.639
PETE: It's like Edward
Scissorhands. Do you like it?

25:51.640 --> 25:53.319
It's a really expensive bush!

25:53.320 --> 25:55.719
I'm sorry, I felt inspiration.
What was I supposed to do?

25:55.720 --> 25:58.039
I'm about to rip this
shit out of the ground.

25:58.040 --> 25:59.239
(GRUNTING)

25:59.240 --> 26:00.919
- Fuck this bush!
- Fuck that bush, man!

26:00.920 --> 26:02.559
- Fuck this bush!
- Fuck that bush!

26:02.560 --> 26:04.839
Harder, man. Yeah,
really get in there.

26:04.840 --> 26:06.559
- Oh! Oh!
- God damn it! Kelly!

26:06.560 --> 26:08.119
Whoa. Hey, man,
buy him dinner first.

26:08.120 --> 26:09.621
Fuck this bush!

26:10.480 --> 26:11.679
(GROANS)

26:11.680 --> 26:12.839
- ALL: Oh!
- Shit!

26:12.840 --> 26:14.439
Okay. Ha-ha.

26:14.440 --> 26:16.863
Sorry, man. Sorry my ball
just got in your face.

26:17.160 --> 26:18.866
(BOTH MOANING)

26:21.320 --> 26:23.663
- I love you.
- Baby.

26:24.880 --> 26:26.159
Oh, God.

26:26.160 --> 26:28.105
I can't believe this is happening.

26:28.600 --> 26:30.079
It's finally happening.

26:30.080 --> 26:31.866
(ALL CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY)

26:32.560 --> 26:34.439
- What the fuck?
- Oh, my God!

26:34.440 --> 26:36.279
Oh, no! Oh, no!

26:36.280 --> 26:38.199
We can't be the only people
in the neighborhood

26:38.200 --> 26:39.359
who are sick of
this bullshit, you know.

26:39.360 --> 26:40.919
We've gotta get
everyone on our side.

26:40.920 --> 26:42.199
We could lead a revolution.

26:42.200 --> 26:43.701
Oh, no.

26:44.760 --> 26:47.319
They're buying off the whole
neighborhood with their slave army.

26:47.320 --> 26:50.983
Oh! Mrs. Haywood,
you're better than that.

26:54.720 --> 26:56.479
I can't sell your house.

26:56.480 --> 26:57.639
- Why?
- Well,

26:57.640 --> 27:00.510
because the only people who would
want to live next to a frat house

27:00.511 --> 27:01.999
is a frat house.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.959
Oh, the university
might be interested.

27:03.960 --> 27:06.879
I know the Spanish department
is looking for a new building.

27:06.880 --> 27:08.639
Only thing, if you
sell to the university,

27:08.640 --> 27:11.199
I'd say, optimistically,
you're looking

27:11.200 --> 27:14.039
at losing about
half your investment.

27:14.040 --> 27:15.399
MAC: Half of all of our...

27:15.400 --> 27:16.919
- We put all of our money in.
- This is all of our money.

27:16.920 --> 27:18.079
We can't lose half.

27:18.080 --> 27:20.559
But you keep half.

27:20.560 --> 27:22.239
We don't need that!
What is that?

27:22.240 --> 27:23.479
Sold!

27:23.480 --> 27:25.239
And you keep making
money no matter what!

27:25.240 --> 27:27.039
Real estate is a fickle bitch.

27:27.040 --> 27:29.319
Okay, maybe it's best you just go.

27:29.320 --> 27:30.719
- Thank you for coming.
- Okay.

27:30.720 --> 27:31.919
That was not helpful.

27:31.920 --> 27:33.706
Well, okay.

27:33.880 --> 27:35.479
- What are you wearing?
- What is this?

27:35.480 --> 27:37.119
- What are you doing?
- Yeah.

27:37.120 --> 27:39.270
We're throwing
a Robert De Niro party.

27:39.280 --> 27:41.479
Should be pretty fucking loud.

27:41.480 --> 27:44.119
It's probably gonna go
pretty fucking late, too.

27:44.120 --> 27:46.559
I'm Taxi Driver De Niro.

27:46.560 --> 27:48.399
Yeah, I'm Meet the Fockers De Niro.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.799
I'm watching you.
I'm watching you.

27:50.800 --> 27:53.799
Who painted that mole on your face?
Did you do that yourself?

27:53.800 --> 27:55.999
Yes, I did. Yes, I did, Focker.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.359
Who are you?

27:57.360 --> 28:00.864
Oh, I'm Sam Jackson, you know,
from Jackie Brown.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.199
Hoo-ah!

28:02.200 --> 28:03.719
ALL: Hoo-ah!

28:03.720 --> 28:05.199
- That's Al Pacino.
- That's not even... Yeah.

28:05.200 --> 28:06.359
Scent of a Woman.

28:06.360 --> 28:08.100
ALL: Hoo-ah!

28:08.480 --> 28:09.879
There's no consistency here.

28:09.880 --> 28:11.639
You're all over the place
with your references.

28:11.640 --> 28:12.799
You're upsetting Jinxy cat.

28:12.800 --> 28:15.399
Just stop doing this
stupid shit! We're sorry.

28:15.400 --> 28:18.039
Hey, when you called the cops, you
violated the circle of trust, Focker.

28:18.040 --> 28:20.542
We're sorry we
called the cops, okay?

28:21.400 --> 28:22.559
Are you talking to me?

28:22.560 --> 28:23.759
- MAC: Yes.
- KELLY: Yes.

28:23.760 --> 28:24.839
Are you talking to me?

28:24.840 --> 28:25.959
- Yes!
- Yes!

28:25.960 --> 28:27.119
No, you talking to me.

28:27.120 --> 28:28.479
- Are you talking to me?
- Are you talking to me?

28:28.480 --> 28:29.799
I don't see anyone else here.

28:29.800 --> 28:31.039
I don't see anyone
else here, either!

28:31.040 --> 28:32.239
We're trying to talk to you.

28:32.240 --> 28:35.679
"The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides..."

28:35.680 --> 28:38.719
What the fuck are you doing? That's
the wrong Sam Jackson speech!

28:38.720 --> 28:40.639
Are you talking to me,
or are you talking to him?

28:40.640 --> 28:41.759
(OVERLAPPING CONVERSATIONS)

28:41.760 --> 28:43.759
- Just get off!
- Are you talking to me?

28:43.760 --> 28:44.919
Shut the fuck up!

28:44.920 --> 28:45.999
You get the fuck out of here.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.501
Stop it!

28:48.160 --> 28:50.599
Hey. What's nice
is in a few years,

28:50.600 --> 28:52.999
we'll have a third
person to help us do this.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.581
Hey.

28:54.600 --> 28:56.829
What do you got there, sweetie?

28:57.240 --> 28:59.026
Is that a balloon?

28:59.080 --> 29:00.991
Did you find a balloon?

29:01.840 --> 29:03.919
Oh, shit! That's
not a balloon!

29:03.920 --> 29:05.159
- Oh, Jesus!
- (SCREAMS)

29:05.160 --> 29:06.879
Oh, God! Oh, no!

29:06.880 --> 29:08.359
Help! Help!

29:08.360 --> 29:10.599
Get the fuck...
Get out of my way! Move!

29:10.600 --> 29:12.909
- Doctor! Doctor!
- Oh, God!

29:15.160 --> 29:17.185
- All right.
- Hey.

29:19.760 --> 29:21.864
Your baby

29:22.800 --> 29:24.399
has HIV.

29:24.400 --> 29:25.679
(GASPS) Oh, my God.

29:25.680 --> 29:28.103
Is how bad this could have gone.

29:28.400 --> 29:29.799
The condom was unused.

29:29.800 --> 29:31.159
(MURMURING)
Are you fucking kidding me?

29:31.160 --> 29:34.584
Who the fuck says that
to a couple of parents?

29:35.640 --> 29:36.839
Hey! Ma'am!

29:36.840 --> 29:38.079
Chill out, chill out!

29:38.080 --> 29:39.519
They are dangerous
to the neighborhood!

29:39.520 --> 29:40.919
There's a clear
focus going on here.

29:40.920 --> 29:42.359
I heard they burned
down their last house.

29:42.360 --> 29:44.359
And they were
reprimanded for that.

29:44.360 --> 29:47.679
We have a very strict three-strike
policy at this school.

29:47.680 --> 29:50.679
So, they have one strike. If they
get two more, then they're out.

29:50.680 --> 29:51.839
A strike?

29:51.840 --> 29:53.839
Well, listen,
the way I do my job is,

29:53.840 --> 29:56.359
you know, I'm always thinking
about the headlines, right?

29:56.360 --> 30:01.239
So, "Duke Lacrosse Team Rapes
Stripper." Bad headline.

30:01.240 --> 30:03.119
"Fraternity Keeps Couple Awake"?

30:03.120 --> 30:05.359
That's not really even a headline.

30:05.360 --> 30:07.559
I don't even think it would
make the local police blotter.

30:07.560 --> 30:09.559
Get ready to read
the headline of the century.

30:09.560 --> 30:12.719
Extra, extra!
"Baby Swallows Condom!"

30:12.720 --> 30:14.559
- That's disgusting!
- Exactly!

30:14.560 --> 30:16.119
- It's the frat's condom!
- That's the frat's condom!

30:16.120 --> 30:17.799
I have a headline for this.

30:17.800 --> 30:20.159
"Fraternity
Practices Safe Sex."

30:20.160 --> 30:22.559
That's a good headline. I could
get a raise off that headline.

30:22.560 --> 30:24.119
I got a headline for you.

30:24.120 --> 30:29.479
"Mean Dean Doesn't Realize That
Frat ls Bad For Everyone."

30:29.480 --> 30:30.719
It's really not.

30:30.720 --> 30:33.119
It's very poorly worded. I don't think
that would ever make it to print.

30:33.120 --> 30:34.439
I don't know where
you went to school.

30:34.440 --> 30:36.959
I went here, okay?
That's why I'm dumb!

30:36.960 --> 30:39.159
You know what? I just thought
of another headline.

30:39.160 --> 30:42.903
"Negligent Parents
Allow Baby to Swallow Condom."

30:43.240 --> 30:45.504
- What'd you say?
- It's not a good headline.

30:45.720 --> 30:48.119
Here's a headline. How
about, "Go Fuck Yourself"?

30:48.120 --> 30:49.279
That's what you get.

30:49.280 --> 30:50.559
- This is our home!
- It's our home!

30:50.560 --> 30:53.919
This is our little cub on our
lawn with a condom in her mouth.

30:53.920 --> 30:55.919
Oh, my God.
I'm a mama bear.

30:55.920 --> 30:57.119
- Yes, you are.
- You know what?

30:57.120 --> 30:59.039
I'm gonna act all
docile and then...

30:59.040 --> 31:00.519
(BOTH ROARING)

31:00.520 --> 31:03.102
My claws are out!
I'm gonna fucking get them!

31:03.120 --> 31:04.679
- (HISSING)
- Fuck these fucking guys!

31:04.680 --> 31:06.359
They don't know who
they are fucking with.

31:06.360 --> 31:08.279
They think I'm just a regular dad

31:08.280 --> 31:10.079
and then you know what happens?

31:10.080 --> 31:11.439
Boom! Boom!

31:11.440 --> 31:14.039
Teddy's dead!
Pete's dead! Scoonie's dead!

31:14.040 --> 31:15.279
- Fuck you!
- No, no.

31:15.280 --> 31:16.799
- I'll fucking kill them!
- No, no.

31:16.800 --> 31:18.479
- Boom!
- No.

31:18.480 --> 31:20.079
- I'm buying a fucking gun!
- No, you're not!

31:20.080 --> 31:22.439
I'm not buying a gun!
You're right, it's a bad idea.

31:22.440 --> 31:23.519
Bad call.

31:23.520 --> 31:24.679
What about one of those
small prostitute guns?

31:24.680 --> 31:26.519
No. You're not buying a gun.

31:26.520 --> 31:27.759
(EXHALES) Fuck!

31:27.760 --> 31:29.119
What can we do?
That fucking Dean.

31:29.120 --> 31:31.559
What woman is named "Dean"?

31:31.560 --> 31:33.479
She's not named "Dean."
That's her job.

31:33.480 --> 31:35.479
- What?
- That's what "dean" is here.

31:35.480 --> 31:36.639
- No.
- Yeah.

31:36.640 --> 31:38.159
- Really?
- What did you think?

31:38.160 --> 31:39.559
- I thought that was her name.
- No.

31:39.560 --> 31:40.759
Oh, no.

31:40.760 --> 31:42.799
- What do they call it in Australia?
- "Chancellor."

31:42.800 --> 31:44.719
No, she's the chancellor.

31:44.720 --> 31:46.839
Oh, my God.
I was so rude to her.

31:46.840 --> 31:48.839
- I don't know what to do.
- What do we know?

31:48.840 --> 31:50.159
What didn't we have in college?

31:50.160 --> 31:51.839
I didn't have any money.

31:51.840 --> 31:53.079
- I had no money either.
- We had no money.

31:53.080 --> 31:54.319
They're broke. They
don't have any money.

31:54.320 --> 31:56.159
We fuck with their house.
They can't afford to fix it.

31:56.160 --> 31:57.639
- Yes.
- They have to move.

31:57.640 --> 31:58.999
- Yeah, fuck them!
- Fuck them!

31:59.000 --> 32:00.279
- We're gonna fucking fuck them!
- Fuck them!

32:00.280 --> 32:02.703
- We are going to fuck them!
- Fuck them!

32:17.520 --> 32:19.181
(BOTH SCREAMING)

(ALL GROANING)

32:23.000 --> 32:24.959
- So the water came out of here?
- Yep.

32:24.960 --> 32:26.519
This is gonna ruin us.

32:26.520 --> 32:29.359
I mean, the foundation is flooded.
We can't pay for this shit.

32:29.360 --> 32:31.039
They're gonna condemn the house.

32:31.040 --> 32:32.519
Okay, well, on that note,

32:32.520 --> 32:34.159
maybe we should clean up and not

32:34.160 --> 32:36.185
stand here with our
dicks in our hands.

32:37.280 --> 32:39.464
"Dicks in our hands."

32:41.320 --> 32:44.949
Dicks in our hands.

32:46.800 --> 32:49.029
Dicks in our hands.

32:49.840 --> 32:53.549
Dicks in our hands.

32:54.360 --> 32:56.799
Dicks in our hands.

32:56.800 --> 32:58.239
Teddy, how much time we got?

32:58.240 --> 33:01.559
Just a couple minutes, and
then we pour in the latex.

33:01.560 --> 33:04.142
We've got Delta Psi dildos
we can merchandise.

33:04.200 --> 33:06.782
Oh, God, I can't keep
my boner much longer.

33:07.160 --> 33:08.359
We're supposed to have boners?

33:08.360 --> 33:10.399
Yeah. Nobody wants a limp dildo.

33:10.400 --> 33:14.159
You don't know that. People
could want it for after.

33:14.160 --> 33:17.759
Like, for cuddling,
and it's like a love...

33:17.760 --> 33:19.599
Okay, you're right.
It's just a limp dick.

33:19.600 --> 33:22.399
Hey, you boys have to go digital.

33:22.400 --> 33:24.039

3-D printer go.

33:24.040 --> 33:25.159

while my dick prints.

33:30.440 --> 33:31.559
Where did you get that?

33:31.560 --> 33:33.239
Got it at my architecture lab.
Pretty cool, right?

33:33.240 --> 33:34.679
- Wow.
- Man, you should go to class sometime.

33:34.680 --> 33:37.039
We have excellent facilities
that, like, no one uses.

33:37.040 --> 33:39.159
All right, let's pull these bad
boys off and see what we've got.

- Yeah.

- Wow.
- Whoa.

Hey, you know, I think the
clay is stuck to my pubes.

33:48.720 --> 33:50.585
Why do you have pubes?

33:51.080 --> 33:52.959
Wait. You guys shaved?

33:52.960 --> 33:54.759
Dude, I texted you.
I said, "Shave."

33:54.760 --> 33:56.919
I thought we were taking pictures.
I cleaned up a little, but...

33:56.920 --> 33:58.467
Not your face.

33:59.560 --> 34:00.799
Oh, God.

34:00.800 --> 34:02.039
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.439
- Don't worry about it.
- I'm gonna enjoy this.

34:03.440 --> 34:04.599
It's not gonna come off.

34:04.600 --> 34:05.959
I'm just gonna leave it on.

34:05.960 --> 34:08.559
I'm gonna drill a hole, I'm gonna pee.
I can get bigger pants.

34:08.560 --> 34:10.438

You trust me, right?

34:32.560 --> 34:33.918
There will be no
cutting in this line,

34:33.920 --> 34:36.399

approximately a 20-minute wait.

34:36.400 --> 34:37.639
- Hey.
- Hi.

34:37.639 --> 34:39.998
- Um... I'll take a Teddy.
- Cool. How about a Pete?

34:40.000 --> 34:41.319
Oh, no.

34:41.320 --> 34:42.639
I was just kidding, anyway.

34:42.639 --> 34:43.998
So weird.

34:44.000 --> 34:47.119
Holy shit, guys.
I think we made $10,000.

34:47.120 --> 34:48.998
Hey, you guys, if my
calculations are correct,

34:49.000 --> 34:50.918
not only can we
fix the water damage,

34:50.920 --> 34:54.583
but we can get the biggest
hot tub in the world!

35:17.240 --> 35:18.439
This is ridiculous.

35:18.440 --> 35:21.519
Their dicks bought a hot tub?
My dick couldn't buy a hot tub.

35:21.520 --> 35:22.879
Hey.

35:22.880 --> 35:26.543
Your dick could buy more than a
hot tub. Your dick bought me.

Thank you very much.

35:28.160 --> 35:29.799
I'm not a sizeist.

35:38.000 --> 35:41.470
I don't get it. Who would
even buy one of those dildos?

35:44.960 --> 35:46.319
Bros before hos.

35:46.320 --> 35:49.399
Why? Because your bros
are always there for you.

35:49.400 --> 35:53.199
They have got your back after
your ho rips your heart out.

35:53.200 --> 35:54.559
"Bros before hos."

35:54.560 --> 35:57.319
And you were nothing
but great to your ho.

35:57.320 --> 35:59.879
And you told her that she
was the only ho for you,

35:59.880 --> 36:03.543
and that she was better than all
the other hos in the world.

36:04.560 --> 36:07.062
Bros before hos.

36:07.240 --> 36:09.239
Fraternities. They live and die
on the concept of brotherhood.

36:09.240 --> 36:10.319
I know.

36:10.320 --> 36:12.359
The only way to break it
apart is to get in there,

36:12.360 --> 36:16.079
infiltrate a party, and get
them to put hos before bros.

36:16.080 --> 36:18.439
Hos don't go before bros. It
just doesn't work like that.

36:18.440 --> 36:19.919
A ho has never gone before a bro.

36:19.920 --> 36:22.199
Maybe I have been a ho
who's taken down some bros.

36:22.200 --> 36:23.919
- Ho, no, you haven't.
- I'm just saying.

36:23.920 --> 36:26.119
You have? That is messed up.

36:26.120 --> 36:27.519
I'm saying, that's the only way.

36:27.520 --> 36:29.279
We've got to get in there,
we gotta infiltrate.

36:29.280 --> 36:32.039
Get those little motherfuckers,
turn them against each other.

36:32.040 --> 36:33.239
- Okay.
- I'm serious.

36:33.240 --> 36:34.519
Just ease up.

36:34.520 --> 36:35.759
Sorry.

first word being "cunt."

36:37.880 --> 36:39.679
- It's not cool here.
- Sorry.

36:39.680 --> 36:41.399
We're gonna make them
put hos before bros.

36:41.400 --> 36:44.471

- I've been waiting forever.

36:52.280 --> 36:53.479
- Yeah, glad you made it.
- Whoa, whoa!

- What is she doing here?
- Wait. What is he doing here?

36:55.640 --> 36:57.079
Look, we're friends
with both of you.

36:57.080 --> 36:58.479

to deal with it, okay?

36:58.480 --> 37:00.119
This is an abomination.

37:00.120 --> 37:02.959
You... Right now, both of you
have to make a choice right now.

37:02.960 --> 37:05.239
Me or her, choose.
It's up to you. You choose.

37:05.240 --> 37:07.279

turn the music down?

tell you to turn it up.

beefing for too long.

squash this like a bug.

really hard for me to get weed.

But she's afraid because Pete
and Teddy are best friends.

to hook up with Pete publicly.

Baby, we're a hot team.

46:01.080 --> 46:03.423
My boobs really hurt.

46:03.760 --> 46:05.799
I think I should probably pump.

46:05.800 --> 46:07.879
My boobs are feeling really full.

46:07.880 --> 46:10.119
I like 'em like that.

Okay, let me call my mom. She'll
tell us what to do right now.

- I don't want to milk you.
- Well, you're gonna have to.

47:51.480 --> 47:53.279
I don't fucking want to!
What do you mean "milk you"?

- Well, how else do you do it?

48:09.040 --> 48:10.159
Just, normal.

48:10.160 --> 48:12.319
There's no normal way
to milk a human woman.

- Okay, okay!
- Come on!

48:15.480 --> 48:16.639

Australia if you don't stop.

let you guys know

us for those kegs?

52:21.400 --> 52:23.425
You interested in
working for AT&T?

52:23.640 --> 52:25.665
What do you guys do?

52:26.360 --> 52:30.039
We're a giant
telecommunications corporation.

52:30.040 --> 52:31.719
- Cell phones.
- Oh.

52:31.720 --> 52:33.199
What's your GPA?

52:33.200 --> 52:34.906
Like, low twos.

52:35.080 --> 52:37.662
I'm just kidding. High ones.

52:39.040 --> 52:40.879
We're actually
looking for candidates

52:40.880 --> 52:42.719
that are a little more
academically inclined.

52:42.720 --> 52:45.239
So, you have a nice day.

52:45.240 --> 52:46.741
What does that mean?

52:46.840 --> 52:48.910
It means you're too dumb.

52:50.520 --> 52:51.679
Good luck, bro.

52:51.680 --> 52:53.227
Okay.

52:54.920 --> 52:57.599
PETE: I hope we can "build"
a great future together.

52:57.600 --> 52:59.101
Architecture joke.

52:59.760 --> 53:01.261
I know!

53:01.920 --> 53:03.759
I like to have fun with it.

53:03.760 --> 53:05.500
Lame.

53:10.120 --> 53:12.079
- Big Mac!
- Yo!

53:12.080 --> 53:13.879
- There he is.
- Hey!

53:13.880 --> 53:15.319
- Hey.
- Hello.

53:15.320 --> 53:17.959
You know, I was just thinking,

53:17.960 --> 53:20.719
it would be great
to have you and Kelly

53:20.720 --> 53:23.559
and your little princess
over for a play date.

53:23.560 --> 53:25.559
- We'll put it on the books.
- Okay, cool. Great.

53:25.560 --> 53:27.279
Sometime soon. I'll just...
I'll get back to you.

53:27.280 --> 53:28.781
- Yeah.
- Great.

53:29.760 --> 53:34.519
"And the dog goes,
'Woof, woof, woof, woof!

53:34.520 --> 53:38.422
"'Woof, woof, woof!"'

53:38.560 --> 53:40.959
- Oh, hi, baby.
- MAC: How's it going?

53:40.960 --> 53:43.479
Oh, good. Yeah, I'm good, I'm fine.

53:43.480 --> 53:44.599
I'm fine.

53:44.600 --> 53:46.479
I'm a bit bored,
but I'm fine. I'm fine.

53:46.480 --> 53:47.839
Yeah, I'm bored, too.

53:47.840 --> 53:49.639
My boss just invited us
for a play date,

53:49.640 --> 53:51.239
so we can both
just kill each other.

53:51.240 --> 53:52.479
(STELLA CRYING ON MONITOR)

53:52.480 --> 53:54.999
I kind of miss the rush
of messing with the frat.

53:55.000 --> 53:56.679
I have to go. She's awake.

53:56.680 --> 53:58.989
Okay, call me after.
Call me soon.

54:05.800 --> 54:07.665
TEDDY: Hey, neighbor.

54:07.960 --> 54:09.279
Ooh!

54:09.280 --> 54:10.906
(ALL LAUGHING)

54:13.320 --> 54:14.519
Okay. Are you ready?

54:14.520 --> 54:16.199
Me and Kelly, we have found a way

54:16.200 --> 54:17.999
to give the frat
their last strike.

54:18.000 --> 54:19.719
- Get them out of here forever!
- Out!

54:19.720 --> 54:22.239
Why are we doing this? Didn't
we already win? Remember?

54:22.240 --> 54:24.599
"Bros before hos,"
that whole thing? It's over!

54:24.600 --> 54:26.719
They're still fucking there!
There's beer cans on the lawn.

54:26.720 --> 54:27.799
They're barbecuing.

54:27.800 --> 54:28.999
- So?
- "So?"

54:29.000 --> 54:30.359
It smells delicious in here.

54:30.360 --> 54:31.999
Try living next to it.
Try living next to it!

54:32.000 --> 54:33.679
Hey, you guys don't
want to go back to your

54:33.680 --> 54:35.319
boring ass lives as parents.
That's what it is.

54:35.320 --> 54:37.319
I'm surprised and
shocked, honestly,

54:37.320 --> 54:39.039
that it is so hard
to convince you,

54:39.040 --> 54:40.679
of all people,
that this is a good idea.

54:40.680 --> 54:41.879
What?

54:41.880 --> 54:46.039
One of those childs is
having sex with your wife.

54:46.040 --> 54:48.199
It's fine. We're divorced.

54:48.200 --> 54:50.039
- Jimmy! Wake up!
- Wake up, man.

54:50.040 --> 54:51.199
His dick is this big!

54:51.200 --> 54:53.359
"Hey, homie. I'm gonna fuck
your wife with my giant dick."

54:53.360 --> 54:54.879
"Oh, my God,
this is amazing."

54:54.880 --> 54:56.319
"Oh, my God, homie.
It feels so good."

54:56.320 --> 54:57.599
- "Oh, homie."
- "Wow. Oh, my God."

54:57.600 --> 54:59.239
- "It feels so good, homie."
- "What are you doing later?"

54:59.240 --> 55:00.399
"Oh, homie, let's do it.
Oh, God, homie."

55:00.400 --> 55:01.519
"That's amazing."

55:01.520 --> 55:03.799
Okay, enough! Stop imitating!

55:03.800 --> 55:05.959
I get it! He's got a huge dick!

55:05.960 --> 55:07.119
And her vagina, "Bye!"
It's ruined!

55:07.120 --> 55:08.279
MAC: Destroyed. Gone!

55:08.280 --> 55:10.039
It's like when you lend
a fat friend your shirt,

55:10.040 --> 55:12.799
and it comes back, and it's
all stretchy and flappy!

55:12.800 --> 55:16.065
Sagging all over the place!
It'll be like this.

55:16.840 --> 55:18.199
- I'm in!
- MAC: Yes!

55:18.200 --> 55:21.239
Nice! Nice! Great!
Awesome, awesome!

55:21.240 --> 55:22.679
- What's the plan?
- Okay, okay.

55:22.680 --> 55:24.239
We've been thinking.
What gets frats

55:24.240 --> 55:26.185
kicked out of schools
more than anything?

55:26.240 --> 55:27.866
Rape!

55:29.440 --> 55:31.799
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

55:31.800 --> 55:33.199
- Hazing scandals.
- Hazing scandals!

55:33.200 --> 55:34.239
- Yes!
- Hazing scandals!

55:34.240 --> 55:35.319
- Hazing scandals!
- Yes!

55:35.320 --> 55:37.199
You should've said it
before you let me answer.

55:37.200 --> 55:39.639
We need all that equipment
you bought to spy on Paula.

55:39.640 --> 55:42.711
I didn't...
(LAUGHS) What?

55:43.280 --> 55:44.599
Just stop.

55:44.600 --> 55:46.439
MAC: Look, you just take
these spy glasses.

55:46.440 --> 55:48.279
They look totally
like normal glasses.

55:48.280 --> 55:49.719
You wear them into the frat house.

55:49.720 --> 55:51.279
Teddy's gonna start
pushing you around

55:51.280 --> 55:52.759
and fucking with you,
like he always does.

55:52.760 --> 55:54.439
Like I've seen him
do a million times.

55:54.440 --> 55:56.919
At that moment,
you just push back.

55:56.920 --> 55:58.879
Okay? Just push back.

55:58.880 --> 56:00.559
The rest will take care of itself.

56:00.560 --> 56:02.199
He'll haze
the fucking shit out of you.

56:02.200 --> 56:03.959
It'll all get
caught on this camera.

56:03.960 --> 56:06.542
Delta Psi is gone,
you're a free man.

56:06.880 --> 56:07.999
Those guys are my brothers.

56:08.000 --> 56:09.119
KELLY: Your brothers?

56:09.120 --> 56:11.159
Do you think your brothers would
really treat you like that?

56:11.160 --> 56:12.439
Think about what
they've done to you.

56:12.440 --> 56:13.799
They dehumanized you.

56:13.800 --> 56:15.799
- They treated you like shit.
- They degraded you.

56:15.800 --> 56:17.439
- JIMMY: You're an animal.
- They called you Assjuice.

56:17.440 --> 56:18.599
Assjuice.

56:18.600 --> 56:20.079
- KELLY: Assjuice.
- MAC: Assjuice.

56:20.080 --> 56:21.839
- JIMMY: Subhuman.
- KELLY: Assjuice.

56:21.840 --> 56:23.759
ALL: Assjuice. Assjuice.

56:23.760 --> 56:25.959
Assjuice. Assjuice.

56:25.960 --> 56:29.359
Assjuice! Assjuice!
Assjuice! Assjuice!

56:29.360 --> 56:31.879
You better eat this
fucking dog food, now!

56:31.880 --> 56:33.427
(SCREAMING)

56:33.920 --> 56:35.199
PETE: What's the lesson?

56:35.200 --> 56:38.599
BOYS: Don't go to sleep!

56:38.600 --> 56:40.864
This is your destiny, Assjuice.

56:41.400 --> 56:42.519
Assjuice!

56:42.520 --> 56:44.959
ALL: (CHANTING)
Assjuice! Assjuice! Assjuice!

56:44.960 --> 56:46.639
Assjuice! Assjuice!

56:46.640 --> 56:47.679
I don't know.

56:47.680 --> 56:48.999
JIMMY: Everyone breaks, bro.

56:49.000 --> 56:50.279
Biology.

56:50.280 --> 56:52.111
That's from Zero Dark Thirty.

56:53.600 --> 56:55.670
You guys don't get it.

56:55.680 --> 56:57.679
I've gone through hell.

56:57.680 --> 56:59.839
I'm not gonna throw
that all away now.

56:59.840 --> 57:02.627
You know how many BJs
I've been promised?

57:02.640 --> 57:04.319
Infinite BJs.

57:04.320 --> 57:06.719
Infinite. Infinite.

57:06.720 --> 57:08.710
Infinite BJs.

57:09.120 --> 57:12.510
Delta Psi forever, ya bish.

57:16.360 --> 57:18.759
We'll give you $1,000.

57:18.760 --> 57:20.519
Okay. I'm in.

57:20.520 --> 57:22.039
Nice!

57:22.040 --> 57:24.039
- Nice! That was good!
- JIMMY: That was good. That was really good.

57:24.040 --> 57:26.030
That was good.
That was sexy, too.

57:26.480 --> 57:28.319
He looks like J.J. Abrams.

57:28.320 --> 57:30.999
MAC: You look good. It looks
okay. I think it's okay.

57:31.000 --> 57:32.159
You're never gonna forget this!

57:32.160 --> 57:35.159
Move, elephants!
Move! Keep marching.

57:35.160 --> 57:36.959
March!

57:36.960 --> 57:38.879
March, march, march, elephants.

57:38.880 --> 57:40.199
I'm not doing this anymore.

57:40.200 --> 57:41.279
Get back in line, Assjuice!

57:41.280 --> 57:42.519
Get back in line!

57:42.520 --> 57:44.599
Fuck you.
I am not an elephant!

57:44.600 --> 57:45.759
What did you just say to me?

57:45.760 --> 57:47.319
I am not an elephant!

57:47.320 --> 57:48.719
He's doing it.
He's doing it.

57:48.720 --> 57:51.559
I'm a human man!
I have dignity!

57:51.560 --> 57:53.559
- We all have dignity!
- Yes, Assjuice, yes!

57:53.560 --> 57:57.479
Our names are not Fuckhead,
or Jizzface, or Lea Michele.

57:57.480 --> 57:58.839
- Lea Michele from Glee?
- That's actually funny.

57:58.840 --> 58:00.119
Yeah, that's really funny.

58:00.120 --> 58:01.667
It's Evan.

58:03.400 --> 58:05.231
And Brendan.

58:05.400 --> 58:06.559
And Juan.

58:06.560 --> 58:08.599
So, fuck you.

58:08.600 --> 58:10.399
Haze me. Say it.

58:10.400 --> 58:12.399
- Say it! Come on!
- Say it, Teddy.

58:12.400 --> 58:15.079
I will haze you until your
fucking face falls off!

58:15.080 --> 58:17.423
ALL: Yeah!

58:17.960 --> 58:19.879
- That's great. Okay, okay.
- We did it.

58:19.880 --> 58:22.119
You're in so much fucking trouble.
Come with me, pledge.

58:22.120 --> 58:23.621
ASSJUICE: Oh, fuck.

58:24.400 --> 58:26.106
Fuck him up, Teddy.

58:28.480 --> 58:30.948
I'm sorry. I'll do anything.

58:35.760 --> 58:37.341
What's going on, Gary?

58:38.040 --> 58:40.239
Are you okay, man?
You seem distraught.

58:40.240 --> 58:41.919
"You seem distraught"?

58:41.920 --> 58:44.279
I mean, you've always been, in my
opinion, like, our strongest pledge,

58:44.280 --> 58:45.599
and now you're talking back.

58:45.600 --> 58:46.999
- ASSJUICE: I'm scared.
- You're scared?

58:47.000 --> 58:50.239
I'm fucking scared, man.
I'm tired all the time.

58:50.240 --> 58:52.439
Fucking tired.
I miss my mom.

58:52.440 --> 58:54.279
- Oh, no, Assjuice.
- Breaking? The guy was right.

58:54.280 --> 58:55.319
Everybody breaks.

58:55.320 --> 58:56.799
Okay. I'll tell you what.

58:56.800 --> 58:58.399
You go up to my room.

58:58.400 --> 59:01.119
Lock the door, draw
yourself a bath. Relax.

59:01.120 --> 59:02.679
- (GASPS)
- "Draw yourself a bath"?

59:02.680 --> 59:04.839
Catch up on some Z's,
okay? Take a nap.

59:04.840 --> 59:06.399
Full season of Girls
up there in the DVR.

59:06.400 --> 59:07.919
We never planned for nice.

59:07.920 --> 59:09.599
Thanks for talking to me,
brother. All right?

59:09.600 --> 59:12.501
You can always come to me with
this kind of stuff, all right?

59:13.640 --> 59:16.439
You're doing a great job.
See you upstairs.

59:16.440 --> 59:18.385
(BOTH IMITATING EXPLOSIONS)

59:22.880 --> 59:25.860
I'm sorry, guys.
He's too good of a dude.

59:26.040 --> 59:27.985
- No!
- Teddy!

59:29.040 --> 59:30.999
- What's up?
- Yeah, one more thing.

59:31.000 --> 59:32.119
No more thing!

59:32.120 --> 59:34.359
These glasses,
there's a camera in them.

59:34.360 --> 59:35.519
ALL: No!

59:35.520 --> 59:36.759
Oh, my God!

59:36.760 --> 59:37.999
The asset's gone rogue.

59:38.000 --> 59:39.079
Shit, he's still talking.

59:39.080 --> 59:40.159
ASSJUICE: Your neighbors
got me to wear them,

59:40.160 --> 59:41.479
so they could film you hazing us,

59:41.480 --> 59:43.039
so the fraternity
would get dissolved.

59:43.040 --> 59:46.199
And this isn't the first time. No, no,
no, no. They flooded the basement.

59:46.200 --> 59:49.431
They got Brother Pete to
hook up with Sister Brooke.

59:50.000 --> 59:51.239
I'm so sorry, man.

59:51.240 --> 59:52.679
- It's okay.
- They've been after us for weeks.

59:52.680 --> 59:54.199
- No!
- He's telling him everything!

59:54.200 --> 59:55.919
- Oh, my God!
- Jesus Christ, guys!

59:55.920 --> 59:57.785
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

59:59.600 --> 01:00:01.101
MAC: Wait.

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:02.359
He's looking at us.

01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:04.703
- What are you doing?
- He's looking at us.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.424
You guys just crossed the
fucking line. You're dead.

01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:09.999
We're dead?

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.159
(YELLS)

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:13.199
- Oh, God! Oh, my God!
- That was scary.

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:14.879
- Come on, guys.
- Jesus.

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:16.999
How do you turn these off?

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.865
ASSJUICE: It's on the side.

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:22.199
(SINGING)
We're gonna go to the shops

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:25.719
Then we're gonna
go to Mommy and Me

01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:29.199
And see all those
bitches that I hate

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:33.159
It's gonna be really boring

01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:35.867
But we'll get out of the house!

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:47.839
KELLY: I think the frat has broken into
the car and stolen all of the airbags.

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:49.399
- Airbags?
- Yeah.

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:51.239
That's so weird. Is
anything else missing?

01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:53.105
- No!
- Okay.

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:54.919
Why would they just break in
and steal the airbags?

01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:56.910
I don't know. We should
file a police report...

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:00.991
(GROANING)

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:04.105
What the fuck?

01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:06.306
Oh, shit!

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:09.671
Found the airbags!

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:12.746
There's three left!

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:15.159
Fuck!

01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:16.741
- Two left!
- (JIMMY GROANING)

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:19.270
Jimmy, are you okay?

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:20.759
I'm fine!

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:23.759
It wasn't as bad as
it seemed. I'm fine.

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:25.879
Delta Psi has the upper hand!

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:28.906
We went too far now.
This is dangerous.

01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:30.639
We did not go too far.

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:32.679
Now is when we get
them back even more.

01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:34.599
Do you see what they fucking
did to me? We don't stop now!

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:36.919
So, what it's gonna be next? They're
gonna break into the house?

01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:38.039
No. No.

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:40.959
You need to grow up, okay?
Our family is in danger.

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:42.799
- I need to grow up?
- Yes, you need to grow up.

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:44.999
One of us has got to be the
adult in this relationship.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.279
You should take responsibility.

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:48.719
That's not only offensive,
but it's fucking stupid.

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:50.639
It's offensive that I'm saying
that you should be smart?

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:53.479
Yes, it's offensive that I have
to be the smart one all the time!

01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:54.999
I'm allowed to be
just as irresponsible as you.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.399
Well, that's how it works!
I'm the dumb guy,

01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:58.919
and you're the woman
who's supposed to

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:00.439
stop the dumb guy
from doing dumb shit!

01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:02.599
Haven't you ever seen
a fucking Kevin James movie?

01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:04.839
We can't both be Kevin
James. I'm Kevin James!

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:06.679
I have a little bit
of Kevin James in me.

01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:07.799
Well, we can't both...

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:10.119
Clearly, you're the one who knows
better, so you should know better.

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:13.319
You know that I'm not like that,
and I've never been like that.

01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:14.999
- Well, maybe you should be.
- That's never been me.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.519
Just because I'm a
mom doesn't mean

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:18.079
that I'm gonna change who I am.

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:19.319
Well, just because I'm a father,

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:22.999
it doesn't mean I can stop doing
mushrooms with teenagers.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.119
- Fine!
- Fine!

01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:25.159
- Good.
- Good, then.

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:27.159
Okay, Kevin, I don't think
we're a good team anymore.

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:28.319
- The team is breaking up.
- Yep.

01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:30.359
This worked before
we had Stella, but...

01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:32.159
- Now it doesn't.
- It doesn't work anymore.

01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:33.519
Yeah, because someone
refuses to grow up.

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:34.599
- Fine. Okay.
- Fine then.

01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:36.519
You go find your
nagging wife that you

01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:38.319
want to find, and I'll
go find a real man.

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:39.879
- Fine! Good to know.
- Fine.

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:42.319
I don't feel safe here,
just in case you didn't know.

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:43.559
Well, that's crazy.

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:44.719
I'm gonna take our child and go.

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:46.079
Oh, yeah? Well,
that's ludicrous,

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:49.239
because this is perhaps the
safest place on the planet,

01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:50.479
just so you know!

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:51.999
- You're kidnapping our baby!
- Asshole!

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.639
Don't kidnap our baby!

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:55.519
I'm gonna put out
an AMBER fucking Alert!

01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:57.559
Enjoy the house by
yourself, you child!

01:02:57.560 --> 01:02:59.505
This is safer
than the White House!

01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:01.711
(GROANING)

01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:03.559
Dude, we missed the airbag!

01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:05.639
Kelly, there's one left!

01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:07.665
It could be anywhere!

01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:09.791
Ow!

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:16.559
Hey, man, do you think, maybe we're
going, like, way too far with this?

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:18.679
I mean, as a child
of divorce, I just...

01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:21.399
I can't help it,
I sympathize with them.

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:25.063
Well, my parents love each other,
and I think it's hilarious.

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:43.431
(SCREAMS)

01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:45.421
Fuck!

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:48.421
Fuckers! Fuck!

01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:18.627
Shalom, Mac.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.639
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:23.879
- How's it going?
- I'm sorry.

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:25.479
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:26.719
I love you so much.
I'm so sorry.

01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:27.879
I love you, I'm sorry.

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:29.279
I was so stupid.

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:31.119
What a stupid
fucking fight to have.

01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:32.439
No, I was stupid.
I'm really, really sorry.

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:33.799
I'm so sorry.
It was so dumb.

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:35.479
- It was really dumb.
- I love you so much, okay?

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:36.839
- Do you still like me?
- I miss you. I love you.

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:38.079
- Do you still like me?
- Yes, I still like you.

01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:40.184
- Okay, good. I love you.
- Okay.

01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:41.719
She's so crazy.

01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:43.426
She's still behind you.

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:46.509
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:55.145
Lame, isn't it, Pete?

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:01.999
Whoa.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.106
You're really
villaining out in here.

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:07.669
What's lame?
What's going on?

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:10.388
Lame that we're on probation.

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:12.319
We're not gonna
end up on this thing.

01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:16.199
That is kind of lame, but also
kind of meaningless, right?

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:17.639
What the fuck are
you talking about?

01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:20.999
No, man. I just mean, like,
you're the President, you know?

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.119
If you want to be up there so
bad, just put your picture up.

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:24.159
No one's gonna stop you.

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:26.788
Because then I didn't earn it.

01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:30.199
It doesn't mean anything
if you don't earn it.

01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:32.145
Who cares?

01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:34.185
"Who cares?"

01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:37.384
Are you kidding me?

01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:42.029
You're the VP, man.

01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:44.679
We have wanted this
since we were freshmen.

01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:47.079
Dude, that was
four years ago, okay?

01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:49.359
We were fucking virgins. All right?

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:51.519
We're about to be,
like, adults now.

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:53.039
In two weeks, none of this
is even gonna matter.

01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:54.479
What the fuck are
you talking about?

01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:57.879
I mean, you do realize that all this
stuff, it's all bullshit, right?

01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:59.319
It's all made up.

01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:02.839
Like, my brother's fraternity also
thinks they invented beer pong.

01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:04.039
Well, your brother is a liar.

01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:06.110
All right, let's put that down.

01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:08.879
Dude, I don't want you
to take this the wrong way,

01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:10.719
but I think you're freaking out

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:12.439
about what you're
gonna do next year.

01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:13.919
What?

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:15.399
I'm trying to be
your friend, okay?

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:17.439
But I don't know why you try
to hide this stuff from me.

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:19.279
I'm a psychology minor,
you know that.

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:20.599
"I'm a psychology minor."

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:22.599
Dude, why do you think
you're so obsessed

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:24.559
with that old couple
next door, all right?

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:26.399
It's because they
remind you of the future.

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:27.679
I'm sorry, but it's true.

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:29.239
What the fuck are
you talking about?

01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:30.679
- You're trying to be my friend?
- Yes!

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:32.719
Well, why don't you go
fuck my girlfriend again?

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:34.119
- What?
- Yeah.

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:35.759
I thought we were over
that. What are you...

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:37.559
How the fuck could I
be cool with that, man?

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:39.319
You had sex with my girlfriend!

01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:41.319
What are you... We said all
those things, all right?

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:42.999
They rhymed!
What the hell was that?

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.839
We said some shit that rhymed?
Are you crazy, man?

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:47.519
How the fuck would
that make me feel better?

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:51.119
You don't think I was clearly
trying to mask how I really felt,

01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:52.479
so I tried to bro out with you?

01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:54.279
I don't know!
You're a good actor!

01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:56.079
What the fuck am I
supposed to think?

01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:57.599
Get the fuck out of here!

01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:00.159
God! Dude, take your shit out
on someone else, all right?

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:01.759
- This isn't about me.
- Okay.

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:04.103
That's right, Pete. Walk away.

01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:06.599
- Bitch.
- Oh, my God.

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:08.226
Ahhh!

01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:10.239
Scoonie put his dick in your mouth

01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:12.105
while you were sleeping, bitch!

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:14.226
Uh-uh. I wasn't asleep.

01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:21.359
(DOOR CLOSES)

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:23.021
(GROANS)

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:33.959
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:35.621
One sec!

01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:38.079
Get your knees in there.

01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:39.820
There you go.

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:44.620
Hey, neighbor.

01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:46.639
What the fuck do you want, man?

01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:48.439
Hi, how's it going?

01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:49.999
- What do you want? It's over.
- Yeah.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.679
You won. There's
nothing else.

01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:52.799
We're just getting started.

01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:54.839
I know what you might be thinking.

01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:56.359
"Teddy is gonna graduate this year

01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:57.919
"and everything's
gonna be fine."

01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:58.999
But it won't.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.946
Because in a few weeks, when school
ends, so does our probation.

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:07.507
There's gonna be hundreds and thousands of
Teddys living next door to you for all time.

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:11.159
Because "Teddy" is just an idea.

01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:12.239
- It's over.
- It's over, man.

01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:13.319
Okay? It's done.

01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:14.679
It's over? Okay, it's over,
it's over, it's over.

01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:16.158
I just have one
thing I wanted to say.

01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:19.158
This entire time, your daughter
is gonna be growing up

01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:22.038
watching all these young,
shirtless men next door,

01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:24.359
and we're gonna be
watching right back.

01:08:24.359 --> 01:08:26.879
You're a bad boy!
Get off our porch.

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:28.479
- Delta Psi, bitch.
- Now! I'm gonna call the police!

01:08:28.479 --> 01:08:29.981
Get off!

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:32.679
We are not moving.

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:35.103
No. They are.

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:36.999
The problem is that
they're on probation.

They're never gonna
do anything ridiculous,

01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:41.279
because they're
watching themselves.

01:08:41.279 --> 01:08:45.227

didn't think they were on probation.

01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:16.999
Me, too.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.759
I love our hand soap
that's shaped like seashells.

01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:20.999
Why?

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.159
It smells like lemongrass.

01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:23.799
Me, too.

01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:26.119
Do you think
we'll be good parents?

01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:29.464
I think we'll be good
at it and bad at it.

01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:32.987
BOTH: Whoa! (LAUGH)

01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:37.079
You know, when we had Stella, I
was afraid of missing the party,

01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:40.902
but then I realized
that we are the party.

01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:43.588
This is the only party
I want to be at.

01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:46.279
You're gonna make me cry.

01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:48.111
Don't cry.

01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:53.591
Oh, my God.

01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:56.830
Where did you get that?

01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:00.022
I brought it into bed with us.

01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:03.663
I also got some
ranch dipping sauce.

01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:05.959
- Oh, my God.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:07.599
That's the best idea.

01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:09.306
Yeah.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:11.706
Mmm!

01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:19.719
TEDDY: Welcome to Abercrombie.

01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:22.143
Come inside. Check out
some board shorts.

01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:24.270
Hey, Mac!

01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:25.879
- Hey, dude.
- What's up, man?

01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:27.039
- What up, man?
- How's it going?

01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:28.719
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:30.039
You're one of those guys!

01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:31.359
- I am, yeah.
- Yeah.

01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:33.319
- It's a pretty good gig.
- Yeah.

01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:35.599
You'd be surprised, I actually
meet a shit-ton of girls here.

01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:36.839
Not that surprised.

01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:38.399
Your body basically
looks like a giant arrow

01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:39.799
pointing right towards your dick.

01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:41.839
- Oh, my God. Thank you.
- No problem, man.

01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:43.919
- I think that's a compliment.
- It is a compliment.

01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:45.239
We went nuts.

01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:46.519
It escalated very quickly.

01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:50.263
It escalated to a really crazy place.
That was really nuts, man.

01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:51.919
How are the guys?

01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:53.759
They're all great. They got
a big house off campus.

01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:56.759
Pete's a fancy architect,
designing buildings and stuff.

01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:59.279
How's the rest of post-college
life treating you?

01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:00.999
It's good, man.
I'm having fun.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.919
I realize I probably should have
studied a little bit more.

01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:05.359
Little bit. (LAUGHS)

01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:08.999
But I'm going to night school
to get my degree, so...

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.264
- Awesome, man.
- Yeah.

01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:13.759
Well, it's still
really good to see you, man.

01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:14.919
Great to see you too, buddy.

01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:16.119
- All right, brother.
- Good to see you.

01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:17.479
Bring it in for the real thing.

01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:19.679
Nice, okay.
Good to see you, dude.

01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:22.103
You know what?
While I'm here...

01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:24.479
I've always wanted to do this.

01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:27.159
All right. Wow,
you're really going for it.

01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:28.839
- I'm doing it.
- Oh, man.

01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:32.799
So, is it our posture?
Why do we look so different?

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:33.959
I don't know, man.
Just be free.

01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:35.479
- Just kind of let it out.
- Okay.

01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:37.141
I feel free.

01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:38.941
(LAUGHS)

01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:42.519
Welcome to Abercrombie & Fitch.
Can we take your order?

01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:43.759
Welcome to Abercrombie & Fitch.

01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:45.919
Abercrombie, Fitch.

01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:47.279
- Welcome to Abercrombie & Fitch.
- How you doing?

01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:48.599
Can we take your order?

01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:50.119
- We're a great team.
- Thanks.

01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:52.031
You make the store
more approachable.

01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:53.639
What does that mean?

01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:54.679
(STAMMERS)

01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:56.839
It's like, I make...

01:29:56.840 --> 01:29:59.279
I'm a more obtainable goal.

01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:00.959
Yeah, you're like
the relaxed-fit jean guy.

01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:03.144
Yeah. I'm the relaxed-fit jeans.

01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:08.959
I made some blue meth.
It's Gatorade.

01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:10.159
Oh, perfect! Great.

01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:11.599
She's all ready to go.

01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:13.639
This is gonna be
the best calendar yet.

01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:14.839
Look at that, sweetie.

01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:16.359
All right. Let's do it.

01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:18.359
Who's my little Heisenberg? You are!

01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:19.639
She's a little meth head.

01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:20.799
No, she just makes it.

01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:22.586
- (COMPUTER RINGING)
- Oh...

01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:26.479
- Hey. Look who it is.
- JIMMY: What's up, dude?

01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:28.159
We're at Burning Man!

01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:29.839
Burning Man!

01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:31.159
KELLY: Hey!

01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:32.519
You guys should come here.

01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:34.519
- Bring Stella! You can bring kids!
- Bring Stella!

01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:36.839
- MAC: No.
- No, we're making a Stella calendar.

01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:38.039
Yeah, we got six months left.

01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:39.199
She's Heisenberg.
She's Walter White.

01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:41.319
- KELLY: See?
- You're such a lame-o!

01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:43.319
- Don't be so fucking lame!
- Totally lame.

01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:44.399
It's awesome!

01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:45.879
It only gets better and better!

01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:49.589
I feel completely comfortable
missing that party. Okay.

01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:51.359
- We gotta go, okay?
- KELLY: We gotta go.

01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:54.079
Yeah, have a good one.
Try not to die.

01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:55.439
What should we do next?

01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:57.039
- Don Draper. Yeah.
- MAC: Yeah, Don Draper.

01:30:57.040 --> 01:30:59.224
Let's get the leading
men out of the way.

01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:01.864
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:04.079
- We love you.
- We love you.

01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:06.264
- Little Walter White.
- Baby.

01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:39.304
JIMMY: Sof hamisschak.
It means "game over."
