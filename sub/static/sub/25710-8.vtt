What's your game?

01:13.945 --> 01:14.905
Ridiculous!

01:21.785 --> 01:23.625
Snuffles, come on!

01:28.465 --> 01:29.945
Snuffles, come on!

01:32.185 --> 01:33.385
Come on, Snuffles.

01:33.465 --> 01:35.585
Mummy needs to pack
for the weekend away with Daddy.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.385
Fuck!

01:47.865 --> 01:49.185
DR. GLENNIS: NEARLY HERE?

01:49.985 --> 01:53.345
Good. Right. Daniel is on his way.

01:54.305 --> 01:56.105
What's all the plastic sheeting for?

01:56.665 --> 01:58.425
I take it you've never watched <i>Dexter?</i>

01:58.505 --> 02:00.465
Annette doesn't like me watching cartoons.

02:02.105 --> 02:04.225
No, no, <i>Dexter's</i> not a cartoon.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.865
Huh. What's, er, what's <i>Dexter</i> about?

02:07.585 --> 02:10.664
<i>Dexter</i> is about a criminal pathologist

02:10.745 --> 02:13.545
- who's also a serial killer.
- Oh, sounds fun.

02:13.625 --> 02:15.745
A kind of
poacher-turned-gamekeeper thing.

02:15.825 --> 02:17.945
And he always laid down
plastic sheeting,

02:18.025 --> 02:19.705
because of all the blood from the victims.

02:19.785 --> 02:20.985
- Ah! <i>Garfield!</i>
- What?

02:21.065 --> 02:22.585
<i>Garfield!</i>

02:22.665 --> 02:24.585
That's what I was thinking about.

02:24.665 --> 02:27.105
The cartoon about the lasagna-loving cat.

02:27.185 --> 02:28.585
Right. Er...

02:29.385 --> 02:30.545
Sorry, what was I saying?

02:30.625 --> 02:32.585
- Plastic sheeting.
- Oh, yes.

02:32.665 --> 02:35.985
Well, the sheeting will just stop
all your blood from getting everywhere.

02:36.065 --> 02:37.865
Excuse me.

02:37.945 --> 02:40.625
Yes. I can assure you, sir,

02:40.705 --> 02:44.465
there'll be no need to spill my blood
upon your beautiful katana.

02:44.545 --> 02:48.145
Daniel shall be here
in two twitches of an owl's feather.

03:13.585 --> 03:15.025
Was that ever in fashion?

03:38.065 --> 03:39.345
Shh!

03:45.265 --> 03:47.105
For God's sake, Snuffles, be quiet!

03:47.745 --> 03:49.025
Snuffles, stop it!

03:52.865 --> 03:54.825
Snuffles!

04:00.025 --> 04:01.145
Hello?

04:01.665 --> 04:02.665
Hello?

04:17.584 --> 04:18.665
Is someone in there?

04:33.065 --> 04:36.345
See, Snuffles? There's no one there.

04:39.668 --> 04:44.668
Subtitles by explosiveskull

04:50.185 --> 04:52.905
I can't for the life of me
imagine where he's got to.

04:52.985 --> 04:55.145
Any last words, Dr. Glennis?

04:55.225 --> 04:57.425
Please don't kill me?

04:57.505 --> 04:59.905
Oh, come on. Something for people
to remember you by.

04:59.985 --> 05:01.945
Let's have a thinkingtons.

05:02.265 --> 05:03.265
Er...

05:04.385 --> 05:06.425
Nah, my... my mind's gone blank.

05:06.505 --> 05:08.505
All I can think about is,
"Please don't kill me."

05:09.065 --> 05:10.465
Okay.

05:12.185 --> 05:13.785
Your hour is up.

05:15.265 --> 05:16.865
Let me just try him one more time, please!

05:16.945 --> 05:18.905
Enough!

05:20.785 --> 05:21.785
One moment.

05:37.545 --> 05:38.865
You might want to get that.

05:53.545 --> 05:56.345
Sorry, got stuck in traff... Fuck!

05:56.425 --> 05:59.905
Daniel, so glad you made it.
Did you find the cash all right?

06:05.985 --> 06:07.345
Could've sworn I left it there.

06:22.545 --> 06:24.065
Is this some kind of joke?

06:25.265 --> 06:26.545
What the fuck's going on?

06:26.785 --> 06:27.865
Bloody hell!

06:28.305 --> 06:30.305
I didn't put the cash in this bag.

06:30.385 --> 06:31.665
I left the money

06:31.745 --> 06:33.945
in a fucking carrier bag.

06:34.425 --> 06:36.145
I put it all in that case!
I dunno how that got in there.

06:36.225 --> 06:38.105
Oh, shit, I know what's happened!

06:38.185 --> 06:40.545
I must've put the case with the cash in it
down and picked this one up.

06:40.625 --> 06:41.625
There must be two cases!

06:42.385 --> 06:44.025
<i>The money must still be at your house.</i>

06:44.105 --> 06:47.305
You are like the fucking billy goat
that took the cursed milk

06:47.385 --> 06:50.225
- And left the magic fucking apples!
- What?

06:50.305 --> 06:51.905
No wonder Becca wanted to
fuck your best friend!

06:51.985 --> 06:54.145
- Becca wanted to fuck me too!
- Dr. Glennis!

06:54.225 --> 06:56.305
Stop talking!

06:58.585 --> 07:01.745
Look... we can get the money back, okay?

07:01.825 --> 07:03.745
I'll go now. I'll be quick.

07:03.825 --> 07:06.545
Yes. Perhaps we can swing by my office
and pick up the real drugs.

07:07.385 --> 07:09.905
I am a respectable drug dealer.

07:09.985 --> 07:11.985
I do not mess about.

07:12.065 --> 07:15.545
That ship has very much sailed,
my friends.

07:16.185 --> 07:18.505
I have to speak to Henchy.
Tell her it's urgent.

07:18.585 --> 07:20.145
<i>She's on Operation Thunderbolt.</i>

07:20.225 --> 07:22.225
I'm on an active investigation
and I need backup now.

07:22.305 --> 07:23.785
<i>Aren't you supposed to be at your desk?</i>

07:23.865 --> 07:25.985
Believe me, when the Chief finds out
what I'm about to uncover,

07:26.065 --> 07:28.665
she'll be pinning awards on me,
not chaining me to a ruddy desk!

07:29.665 --> 07:31.705
Please. We're good people!

07:32.305 --> 07:34.305
Good people?

07:34.385 --> 07:36.065
You're faking cancer!

07:36.145 --> 07:37.425
You're worse than me.

07:37.865 --> 07:40.185
- What? You told him?
- Yes.

07:40.265 --> 07:42.945
There's a poster with your face on it
by the bus stop,

07:43.025 --> 07:45.385
"Daniel's got cancer,
but we're looking after him."

07:45.465 --> 07:47.985
- For shame!
- But I didn't wanna be on a poster!

07:49.265 --> 07:50.905
I didn't wanna fake cancer!

07:51.785 --> 07:53.225
I know it's wrong, okay?

07:53.305 --> 07:56.185
It's the worst thing anyone can do,
but do I really deserve to...

07:56.265 --> 07:58.185
Die? Yes.

07:58.265 --> 08:00.185
You keep telling me that,
but in my game,

08:00.265 --> 08:04.945
you very much need to send out a signal
under these circumstances.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.025
Who the fuck's that?

08:25.665 --> 08:28.225
There's a civilian gone inside. Over.

08:28.585 --> 08:31.185
- We're gonna have to stand down.
- Her Nibs won't be pleased.

08:31.265 --> 08:33.664
<i>Proceed with
Operation Thunderbolt as planned.</i>

08:33.745 --> 08:37.664
<i>A civilian buying drugs is not a civilian.
They are a criminal. You hear me? Over.</i>

08:42.225 --> 08:44.025
- A woman?
- Hi.

08:44.105 --> 08:45.305
What do you want?

08:46.785 --> 08:48.265
I'd like to buy some drugs.

08:53.975 --> 08:56.815
- So, what was your plan, Officer Hayward?
- I didn't have one.

08:57.695 --> 08:59.015
So...

09:00.215 --> 09:01.535
Who are you?

09:02.095 --> 09:03.495
Are you a pig?

09:03.575 --> 09:04.735
No, sir.

09:05.215 --> 09:06.255
Mmm, yes you are.

09:07.575 --> 09:09.055
You're an undercover pig.

09:09.135 --> 09:10.375
I'm not, I swear.

09:10.455 --> 09:12.535
I just want to get high on some drugs.

09:13.255 --> 09:14.655
I'm... jonesing.

09:17.135 --> 09:20.775
Look, do you know what a speedball is?

09:20.855 --> 09:22.535
That's cocaine and heroin.

09:22.975 --> 09:24.375
Correct. Well done.

09:25.055 --> 09:26.455
Go and get her one.

09:26.535 --> 09:28.335
Mmm, can't wait.

09:35.335 --> 09:36.695
I have an idea.

09:37.135 --> 09:39.335
You know, this chap here's a doctor.

09:40.175 --> 09:41.775
Why don't you give it to her?

09:42.135 --> 09:43.095
Me?

09:55.415 --> 09:56.495
Sorry about this.

10:00.255 --> 10:02.575
Do it... or I'll do you.

10:05.335 --> 10:06.215
Here goes.

10:08.815 --> 10:10.735
Argh!

10:10.815 --> 10:13.135
- Police! Open up!
- Fuck!

10:13.215 --> 10:14.735
My shitting arm!

10:14.815 --> 10:15.895
Go!

10:17.855 --> 10:19.255
The bathroom, quick!

10:19.335 --> 10:21.695
- Armed police!
- Armed police!

10:26.055 --> 10:29.095
Get on the floor! Get on the floor now!

10:31.695 --> 10:33.815
- Don't struggle!
- Good work, lads.

10:33.895 --> 10:36.295
- Ma'am, it's me. Officer Hayward.
- Chris?

10:36.375 --> 10:38.735
- What, you know this prick, ma'am?
- Yes, he's one of us.

10:38.815 --> 10:41.415
- Just about.
- What did I say?

10:41.495 --> 10:44.175
Even if we could get through there,
there's 20-odd police outside.

10:44.255 --> 10:46.415
Chris, are you a drug addict?

10:46.495 --> 10:48.935
No, I know it doesn't look great,
but I've got them.

10:49.015 --> 10:51.215
- Got who?
- The doctor and his cancer patient.

10:51.295 --> 10:52.855
- They're drug dealers.
- Not this again, Chris!

10:52.935 --> 10:54.375
I thought you'd put this all behind you.

10:54.455 --> 10:57.495
I can finally prove to you
that I was right. Mmm!

10:57.895 --> 11:00.655
Ah! We could say that we're plumbers,
and if anyone asks,

11:00.735 --> 11:02.415
we're here to fix a broken toilet.

11:02.495 --> 11:05.055
That'll be believable, what with all
the plumbing equipment we've got.

11:05.415 --> 11:07.295
- I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to arrest you.
- No!

11:07.375 --> 11:08.415
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

11:08.495 --> 11:09.975
Sorry to do this, ma'am.
It's the only way.

11:10.375 --> 11:11.415
Okay.

11:11.495 --> 11:14.535
The two people who will prove
that I was right all along

11:15.455 --> 11:17.495
are hiding in this bathroom.

11:17.575 --> 11:19.175
- All right.
- Open the door, ma'am.

11:20.655 --> 11:22.215
It's locked.

11:22.815 --> 11:25.095
Think you can avoid justice
with a flimsy bathroom door lock?

11:26.335 --> 11:28.695
- Get someone to knock it down, ma'am.
- Errol, knock it down.

11:33.855 --> 11:34.695
What?

11:36.815 --> 11:38.135
No fucking way!

11:38.215 --> 11:39.855
It's a Christmas fucking miracle.

11:44.775 --> 11:46.815
- Go, quick!
- There's a bazooka!

11:50.095 --> 11:51.575
That's it. Ah!

11:51.895 --> 11:53.255
We must be next door.

11:53.335 --> 11:54.335
Thank you!

11:55.175 --> 11:58.775
Daniel Glass and Dr. Iain Glennis,
I am arresting...

12:00.255 --> 12:01.455
Oh, shit!

12:01.535 --> 12:03.575
Nasty nick there. Right.

12:04.735 --> 12:07.095
- When was the last time you changed that?
- Oh, it's fine.

12:07.175 --> 12:09.775
What? Where are they?

12:10.615 --> 12:11.655
All right.

12:12.615 --> 12:13.695
Now we're blood brothers.

12:16.095 --> 12:17.175
Now!

12:26.615 --> 12:28.175
We have to go.
They might find the secret door.

12:36.095 --> 12:37.935
- Please act normal.
- Yes, I am doing!

12:38.575 --> 12:40.295
You're not. You're staring at the ground!

12:41.815 --> 12:44.655
Look at my willy. Dry as a bone.

12:46.335 --> 12:47.495
Yes!

12:51.975 --> 12:53.335
We nearly made it.

12:57.215 --> 12:58.855
Why are your hands in the air?

13:01.215 --> 13:02.855
‘Cause we're... we're under arrest.

13:03.175 --> 13:06.975
Yeah, and I arrest you
on suspicion of getting lost

13:07.055 --> 13:09.135
while participating in a charity run.

13:09.975 --> 13:11.015
What?

13:11.095 --> 13:13.815
And Dad, you should be taking it easy
after your broken leg.

13:15.535 --> 13:17.375
- Dad.
- Yeah.

13:17.455 --> 13:20.535
Yeah, he insisted on coming to support me.

13:21.575 --> 13:23.455
Ah, well, look,
I know it's against the rules,

13:23.535 --> 13:25.255
but jump in and I'll take you
to the finish line.

13:25.335 --> 13:26.575
I won't tell if you don't.

13:27.855 --> 13:28.695
Shh!

13:33.855 --> 13:36.055
I've been round the whole course
and I can't find Daniel.

13:36.135 --> 13:37.575
Yeah, I've not seen him either.

13:37.655 --> 13:39.895
Although, to be honest,
I don't think he could keep up.

13:39.975 --> 13:42.335
Shaved three seconds
off my personal best.

13:42.735 --> 13:44.735
Two hours, 23 minutes, 13 seconds.

13:45.375 --> 13:48.495
Yeah, it's a shame your wife
wasn't here to see it, isn't it?

13:49.495 --> 13:50.655
Hi, guys.

13:50.735 --> 13:52.455
Yay! You finished.

13:53.495 --> 13:58.415
Yes, he finished about 30 minutes ago.
I just needed to check his vitals.

13:58.495 --> 13:59.655
And is he okay?

13:59.735 --> 14:02.215
Oh, yes, yes, he's fit as a fisherman.

14:02.855 --> 14:04.815
- Apart from the...
- Apart from the cancer, yes.

14:04.895 --> 14:06.655
- Yes.
- So, what was your time?

14:08.975 --> 14:11.815
Er, two hours, ten minutes and...

14:12.455 --> 14:13.615
- 43 seconds?
- 43.

14:13.695 --> 14:14.735
Oh, f...

14:16.215 --> 14:18.575
Fast. Really fast.

14:19.455 --> 14:22.415
It's the fastest time this year
by a man who has cancer.

14:23.095 --> 14:25.575
I mean, you don't even look like
you broke a sweat.

14:26.895 --> 14:30.415
You should've seen me 30 minutes ago.
I was drenched, wasn't I?

14:31.055 --> 14:34.295
Yes, yes. Had trouble
listening to his chest.

14:34.375 --> 14:37.095
The stethoscope kept sliding off.

14:38.455 --> 14:39.495
He stank as well.

14:40.255 --> 14:42.255
Well, good job, Daniel.

14:42.975 --> 14:44.935
Especially for someone
with your condition.

14:46.375 --> 14:47.255
Yeah.

14:48.935 --> 14:51.935
- Well, I guess the bracelets are a hit.
- Yeah.

14:52.015 --> 14:53.015
They're a...

14:53.535 --> 14:54.695
real life-saver.

14:57.295 --> 14:59.055
<i>Can't believe we weren't arrested.</i>

14:59.135 --> 15:00.335
Yes, I...

15:00.975 --> 15:02.935
thought our gooses
were well and truly cooked.

15:03.335 --> 15:05.255
- Geese.
- Yes.

15:05.815 --> 15:07.095
It's almost over.

15:08.815 --> 15:10.015
All of it.

15:11.615 --> 15:13.935
I can't wait to have a big, long sleep.

15:14.455 --> 15:18.815
If you'll excuse me, I'm off
to spend a romantic weekend

15:18.895 --> 15:20.815
with my beautiful wife Annette.

15:22.335 --> 15:23.615
Give me.

15:24.935 --> 15:26.415
Peace be with you.

15:28.815 --> 15:32.335
Looks like I'm gonna stay here
a little longer. It's a fucking mess.

15:32.415 --> 15:35.015
Question. When we rescued the gorillas
from the lab,

15:35.095 --> 15:37.695
they were going to give them cancer,
right?

15:39.495 --> 15:41.175
Any idea how they do that?

15:43.175 --> 15:44.335
Oh, really?

15:45.415 --> 15:46.735
Good to know.

15:51.415 --> 15:53.695
So... where shall we get this drink, then?

15:54.055 --> 15:56.095
Well, there's a great pub near mine.

15:56.175 --> 15:59.775
Jack the Ripper mutilated one of
his prostitutes outside it.

16:00.375 --> 16:01.815
Oh, what happened to your hand?

16:01.895 --> 16:02.775
Fucking hell!

16:02.855 --> 16:03.975
I NEED TO SEE YOU URGENTLY.
BECCA WAS FUCKING ASH.

16:04.055 --> 16:05.055
What's up?

16:07.375 --> 16:09.215
I'm sorry, Linda. I've got to go.

16:09.295 --> 16:10.495
Again?

16:11.215 --> 16:13.135
- Daniel!
- It's my dad.

16:13.215 --> 16:15.495
He's had a fall.
He broke his leg recently.

16:16.655 --> 16:17.855
Can't be helped.

16:19.135 --> 16:20.135
You should go to him.

16:21.255 --> 16:22.375
Sorry, Linda.

16:25.655 --> 16:26.895
Cheeringtons!

16:27.415 --> 16:28.535
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

16:29.135 --> 16:31.215
Enjoying your champagne wine?

16:31.295 --> 16:35.695
Delicious. Especially now I know
we're fully paid-up members.

16:36.095 --> 16:40.135
But really, Iain, £18,000 in a wardrobe?

16:40.215 --> 16:42.495
I wasn't going to risk
keeping it in the bank,

16:42.575 --> 16:44.215
not after the whole...

16:44.735 --> 16:46.015
British exit thing.

16:46.695 --> 16:47.895
Hmm.

16:48.535 --> 16:50.495
Why don't you tell me
what's been going on?

16:51.455 --> 16:54.335
Is it anything to do with that odd
Shankowic person we met here?

16:54.415 --> 16:57.295
Annette!

16:58.455 --> 17:00.735
No. No!

17:01.535 --> 17:02.775
No.

17:03.975 --> 17:04.775
No.

17:08.095 --> 17:09.095
Yes.

17:17.175 --> 17:18.615
I, er...

17:20.694 --> 17:24.655
I sold him some drugs from the clinic.

17:28.494 --> 17:29.975
He is a drug dealer.

17:32.335 --> 17:33.615
And now I am too.

17:34.855 --> 17:36.215
But I did it for you.

17:38.295 --> 17:39.375
I did it for us.

17:42.455 --> 17:44.895
You have to believe me, Annette.
I'm not a bad man.

17:45.695 --> 17:46.575
Just...

17:48.175 --> 17:49.495
Oh, please don't leave me.

17:50.895 --> 17:52.295
Please don't leave me.

17:55.495 --> 17:56.815
You knew about it?

17:58.495 --> 18:00.055
Not for definite, but...

18:00.575 --> 18:01.895
I suspected.

18:03.615 --> 18:05.375
Well, why didn't you say anything to me?

18:05.935 --> 18:08.535
Well, you know,
there was so much going on.

18:09.495 --> 18:12.535
I thought the last thing we all needed
was another bombshell.

18:17.015 --> 18:18.415
I feel so stupid.

18:19.095 --> 18:20.255
Don't.

18:21.815 --> 18:25.295
I cried with her at Ash's wake.
She consoled me.

18:26.295 --> 18:27.975
And then she tried to get off with me.

18:28.895 --> 18:30.375
What? Jesus!

18:31.175 --> 18:32.575
God, I really need to move out.

18:32.655 --> 18:35.535
She must know something
about his death. She must!

18:35.615 --> 18:37.135
Oh, no, come on.

18:37.735 --> 18:39.975
She may have cheated on both of us,
but she's not...

18:40.695 --> 18:41.735
a murderer.

18:42.975 --> 18:45.335
And you. All while you were ill.

18:46.815 --> 18:49.815
Imagine how she'd feel if she found out
if <i>we</i> were having an affair!

18:49.895 --> 18:53.015
Yeah, well, do you know what,
I don't think she'd be that bothered.

18:58.455 --> 18:59.695
You're so good.

19:04.855 --> 19:05.975
Kind.

19:10.855 --> 19:11.855
And honest.

19:13.415 --> 19:14.815
Yeah.

19:18.495 --> 19:22.255
I wish I'd got together with you
instead of Ash.

19:22.335 --> 19:24.775
Oh, no, you don't.

19:31.095 --> 19:33.095
Let's have a drink. JD and Coke?

19:34.495 --> 19:36.575
Do you know what,
I'm actually a bit tired.

19:36.655 --> 19:38.055
Come on! Just one.

19:38.135 --> 19:40.975
- Er, no, I'm...
- Yeah.

19:41.055 --> 19:42.495
- No.
- Just one.

20:01.455 --> 20:03.895
Sorry, Daniel, we're, um, out...

20:17.695 --> 20:18.735
Oh!

20:19.975 --> 20:22.695
Iain, fuck me!

20:22.775 --> 20:24.015
Oh, yes!

20:25.735 --> 20:27.935
Choke me, Annette, choke me!

20:28.655 --> 20:30.655
I'm arriving!

20:40.975 --> 20:43.175
You scared the shit out of me!

20:43.255 --> 20:45.615
I didn't want to wake Benny up,
but we've got to talk.

20:45.695 --> 20:47.255
- Oh, yeah.
- Can I come in?

20:47.335 --> 20:49.615
No, and I'll tell you why. You...

20:49.695 --> 20:50.695
I <i>was</i> having an affair with Ash.

20:52.095 --> 20:54.535
I'm sorry, but it's just what happened.
We'd broken it off.

20:55.535 --> 20:58.175
He'd come over to talk
and we said we were gonna stop. I swear.

20:59.495 --> 21:01.815
- You fucking slag! You...
- Shh. I think...

21:04.335 --> 21:05.495
I think Daniel killed him.

21:07.215 --> 21:08.455
Killed Ash?

21:08.535 --> 21:10.015
I think Daniel got home,

21:10.095 --> 21:11.375
found Ash there.

21:12.135 --> 21:14.055
They had a fight
and he pushed him out the window.

21:14.735 --> 21:17.535
Then Daniel moved the body
and made it look like a hit and run.

21:17.615 --> 21:19.935
- What?
- And his weird friend Will...

21:20.015 --> 21:20.855
Yeah?

21:21.815 --> 21:22.975
I think Daniel killed him too.

21:24.175 --> 21:25.175
No.

21:28.495 --> 21:29.815
I don't believe it.

21:31.415 --> 21:32.775
Not Daniel.

21:34.455 --> 21:35.495
A killer?
