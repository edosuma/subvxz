02:07.090 --> 02:08.520
What's wrong?

02:08.520 --> 02:09.520
Huh?

02:11.990 --> 02:13.760
We were missing one.

02:14.430 --> 02:15.530
Who?

02:16.329 --> 02:17.100
What?

02:17.100 --> 02:18.329
Go to sleep.

02:18.770 --> 02:20.200

03:02.210 --> 03:03.210
Wow!

03:03.510 --> 03:04.980
You look so bright and cheerful.

03:05.180 --> 03:06.580
- Really?
- Yes.

03:08.520 --> 03:10.120
By the way,

03:10.120 --> 03:12.220
I'm worried Stella isn't feeling well.

03:13.320 --> 03:15.190
We should get some IV fluids in her.

03:15.190 --> 03:16.360
After the signing event today,

03:16.360 --> 03:18.060
we have nothing in the evening.

03:18.060 --> 03:19.390
Let's take her to the hospital.

03:19.390 --> 03:20.260
Okay.

03:21.260 --> 03:22.000
Wow.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.329
Our baby is all grown up, looking after us now.

03:26.470 --> 03:28.800
You're so sweet.

03:48.990 --> 03:50.090
Stella!

03:50.090 --> 03:51.090
Are you not done yet?

03:51.090 --> 03:52.770
The briefing will start.

03:55.500 --> 03:56.500
Okay...

03:58.030 --> 03:59.300
We're all here, right?

04:00.500 --> 04:01.740
Okay.

04:02.040 --> 04:06.110
According to Writer Jeong, our PR team leader,

04:06.110 --> 04:08.110
our fans on twitter increased 10 fold.

04:08.110 --> 04:10.050
Our video channel subscribers are now 1.1 million.

04:10.050 --> 04:11.810
Our home master's twitter has 300,000 followers.

04:11.810 --> 04:13.920
We rank #2 in social media interest rate.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.550
We rank #4 in girl group brand reputation index.

04:15.550 --> 04:17.050
We rank #5 in star brand reputation index.

04:17.050 --> 04:18.649
We rank #3 in idol singer brand reputation index.

04:18.649 --> 04:19.620
To congratulate our music video

04:19.620 --> 04:21.720
getting 5 million views,

04:21.720 --> 04:23.130
our fans put an ad on the bus.

04:23.130 --> 04:25.660
We got a lot of proof shots getting posted.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.060
How about TV networks?

04:28.330 --> 04:29.460
Okay.

04:29.700 --> 04:32.030
4 shows we were in got top ratings in reality TV.

04:32.030 --> 04:33.470
We got a total of 600,000 views of

04:33.470 --> 04:36.040
fancam videos for each member in college events.

04:36.040 --> 04:39.140
No.1 and 2 in the V-live cover videos per member.

04:39.140 --> 04:40.840
"White Day" got 700,000 subscribers.

04:40.840 --> 04:43.409
We're booming up in the "Fishing Guys" channel.

04:43.409 --> 04:45.450
The B cuts of the Women Celeb photo shoot

04:45.450 --> 04:46.980
got 1.3 million likes.

04:46.980 --> 04:47.820
Should I go on?

04:47.820 --> 04:48.950
Wow!

04:48.950 --> 04:51.920
We worked really hard.

04:52.090 --> 04:53.290
Our PR team worked really hard, too.

04:53.290 --> 04:54.760
We also made a lot of noise.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.560
The key is making No.1 on the charts.

04:59.190 --> 05:00.300
Only then can we go on a music show.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.330
Even if we release it now, I bet we'll be No.1.

05:02.700 --> 05:05.330
Everyone is like, "Let's hear it first."

05:05.330 --> 05:06.640
Whatever!

05:06.940 --> 05:08.740
You know what's the cherry on top?

05:08.740 --> 05:10.410
Starpeace must take responsibility!

05:10.410 --> 05:12.110
Take responsibility! Take responsibility!

05:12.110 --> 05:14.680
Help Cotton Candy become No.1!

05:14.680 --> 05:16.040
Calla

05:16.040 --> 05:19.350
is supporting us so we'll disband.

05:19.350 --> 05:20.250
Can you

05:20.250 --> 05:21.780
believe this irony?

05:21.780 --> 05:23.450
Cotton Candy! Cotton Candy!

05:39.770 --> 05:40.800
Hey!

05:40.800 --> 05:41.840
Did you pass?

05:42.140 --> 05:43.640
Oh, no.

05:43.840 --> 05:45.870
You'll get your driver's license after we disband?

05:45.870 --> 05:47.680
What was it this time?

05:48.210 --> 05:49.310
- Speeding.
- What?

05:49.310 --> 05:50.950
I wanted to get my license quickly,

05:50.950 --> 05:52.510
so I rushed it.

05:56.180 --> 05:57.590
Huh? It's CEO Cha.

05:57.720 --> 05:58.420
Hello.

05:58.420 --> 05:59.350
You're here.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.520
Why are you here this time?

06:01.520 --> 06:03.040
I've come to watch.

06:03.090 --> 06:05.690
What a poor excuse!

06:06.060 --> 06:08.300
You're here to look good.

06:08.300 --> 06:09.930
Since you're getting criticism for

06:09.930 --> 06:11.300
not supporting us even with Ji-han on our side.

06:11.300 --> 06:13.500
You rejected our support.

06:13.500 --> 06:15.070
The agency feels this is unfair.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.910
This is so gratifying!

06:18.910 --> 06:21.040
How does it feel to be rejected?

06:21.140 --> 06:21.680
Great, right?

06:21.680 --> 06:23.350
Okay, let's all go inside.

06:23.350 --> 06:24.210
Let's go.

06:24.210 --> 06:25.510
Go inside.

06:32.290 --> 06:33.890
Thank you for coming.

06:33.890 --> 06:35.820
You've taken Ji-han hostage.

06:36.490 --> 06:38.590
Then you tell the agency to butt out.

06:38.590 --> 06:39.690
Anyway.

06:39.890 --> 06:41.800
Congratulations on your first signing event.

06:42.030 --> 06:43.030
Go on.

06:44.900 --> 06:46.020
We'll do well.

06:47.940 --> 06:48.940
Good luck!

Cotton Candy Fan Signing Event

06:53.510 --> 06:56.310

06:56.580 --> 06:58.750
Because at this rate, it looks like

06:58.750 --> 07:01.280
you'll really go on a music show.

07:02.520 --> 07:04.520
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

07:04.950 --> 07:09.060
Many people now root for your battle.

07:09.220 --> 07:11.190
Becoming No.1 then disbanding

07:11.190 --> 07:13.900
sounds like a slogan, to be frank.

07:13.900 --> 07:14.970
Disbanding...

07:15.700 --> 07:16.970
Will you go to the end?

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Yes.

07:21.040 --> 07:22.100
We will

07:27.310 --> 07:28.240
disband.

07:28.840 --> 07:29.740
Wait.

07:29.740 --> 07:30.680
Then

07:30.680 --> 07:33.150
your fans must wish you don't make No.1.

07:34.150 --> 07:35.350
Still, please

07:35.650 --> 07:36.920
root for us to make No.1.

07:37.220 --> 07:39.020
We have to begin.

07:39.020 --> 07:40.120
Okay.

07:41.690 --> 07:44.260
I'll root for you to make No.1

07:44.260 --> 07:46.190
and also object you disbanding.

07:46.630 --> 07:48.760
- Thank you.
- Good work.

07:48.760 --> 07:49.800
Good job.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.670
- Good work.
- Thank you.

07:51.770 --> 07:52.670
Good work.

07:52.670 --> 07:53.900
- Let's go.
- Wait.

07:54.370 --> 07:57.310
I had a bad dream, so I'm a bit leery.

07:57.310 --> 07:57.970
Hey.

07:57.970 --> 07:59.440
You said it was a silly dream.

07:59.440 --> 08:00.980
You're being too serious.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.980
I have a very good hunch.

08:02.980 --> 08:04.050
Anyway!

08:04.050 --> 08:06.580
Let's be careful today, okay?

08:06.580 --> 08:08.120
- Okay.
- Alright, alright.

08:08.420 --> 08:09.550
Let's go.

08:12.150 --> 08:13.720
Stella, wait.

08:14.460 --> 08:16.660
Is something going on?

08:18.090 --> 08:20.000
No.

08:22.160 --> 08:24.500
Is there a phone call you're avoiding?

08:24.870 --> 08:25.830
I saw you the other day...

08:25.830 --> 08:27.400
No, there's no such thing.

08:39.250 --> 08:40.480
What's your name?

08:40.980 --> 08:42.720
It's cold today. Take care.

08:42.919 --> 08:43.350
Thank you.

08:43.350 --> 08:44.150
I love you so much!

08:44.150 --> 08:45.150
Thank you.

08:45.390 --> 08:47.060
I made it myself.

08:45.690 --> 08:46.490
I love you, Park Chae-ah

08:50.020 --> 08:51.390
Thank you.

08:51.390 --> 08:53.830
- Hello.
- I love you so so much!

08:53.830 --> 08:54.530
Thank you.

08:54.530 --> 08:55.600
Hi, big sis!

08:55.600 --> 08:59.300
I was a huge fan ever since you were a kid.

08:59.300 --> 09:00.200
I'm the big sis?

09:00.200 --> 09:01.770
- Big sis.
- Big sis.

09:01.770 --> 09:03.040
You're so pretty.

09:06.710 --> 09:08.240
I'm Park Chae-ah.

09:08.710 --> 09:09.280
What?

09:09.280 --> 09:11.480
So Park Chae-ah is the best!

09:13.920 --> 09:14.780
Thank you!

09:14.780 --> 09:16.480
Can I hold your hand once?

09:16.480 --> 09:17.190
Yes, of course.

09:17.190 --> 09:19.120
Thank you!

09:19.120 --> 09:20.020
Thank you.

09:20.020 --> 09:21.420
Bye.

09:22.560 --> 09:23.560
Hello.

09:23.560 --> 09:24.830
Yes, hello.

09:24.830 --> 09:26.590
Can I hold your hand, too?

09:26.590 --> 09:27.930
Of course.

09:32.730 --> 09:33.900
It's been a long time.

10:02.660 --> 10:03.870
What's wrong?

10:05.800 --> 10:07.570
What is it, Stella?

10:08.570 --> 10:10.970
Oh, there was a bug.

10:10.970 --> 10:12.510
What? A bug?

10:14.310 --> 10:15.240
Sorry.

10:15.240 --> 10:16.410
I'm sorry.

10:19.410 --> 10:21.950
It suddenly got on my face, so I was startled.

10:23.220 --> 10:25.220
You look shocked.

10:25.450 --> 10:26.620
I can shake your hand next time.

10:26.620 --> 10:28.160
I'm sorry.

10:28.330 --> 10:29.260
Good day.

10:31.960 --> 10:34.230
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

10:34.560 --> 10:35.760
Sit down.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.200
- Hello.
- Hi.

10:47.640 --> 10:48.680
Stella!

10:51.350 --> 10:52.650
Who was that?

10:53.480 --> 10:55.020
What's going on?

10:55.780 --> 10:56.950
It's nothing.

10:57.150 --> 10:58.350
I don't know him.

10:58.350 --> 11:00.190
Yes, you do.

11:01.660 --> 11:03.420
You're shaking.

11:04.490 --> 11:05.390
No.

11:05.390 --> 11:06.190
Stella.

11:06.190 --> 11:07.800
He looked like someone I know.

11:07.800 --> 11:09.030
So I was startled.

11:09.030 --> 11:09.560
Who?

11:09.560 --> 11:11.530
Why are you being so nosy?

11:30.820 --> 11:32.090
It's been a long time.

11:32.250 --> 11:33.860
It can't be him.

12:48.700 --> 12:49.760
It's cold.

13:08.020 --> 13:09.050
Hey.

13:09.380 --> 13:10.380
Here.

13:15.590 --> 13:17.290
It can't be him.

13:19.590 --> 13:21.130
Why now?

13:40.850 --> 13:42.180
1 unread message

13:42.180 --> 13:43.690
You're not picking up again.

13:44.090 --> 13:45.950
We just said hello.

13:45.950 --> 13:47.460
It's rude to ignore me.

14:27.730 --> 14:28.730
Welcome.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.400
Why are you standing there? Come closer.

14:32.400 --> 14:33.700
It's been a long time.

14:36.200 --> 14:39.010
You wondered why I disappeared so suddenly, huh?

14:39.370 --> 14:40.410
You know me.

14:40.410 --> 14:42.310
Artists are like that.

14:42.310 --> 14:43.710
For three years,

14:43.710 --> 14:44.780
I worked on a boat.

14:44.780 --> 14:46.280
I was in New York for about a year

14:46.280 --> 14:47.750
begging for money.

14:48.180 --> 14:49.450
You haven't been to New York, huh?

14:49.450 --> 14:51.820
It's terrific. I got so inspired.

14:53.190 --> 14:55.090
I didn't know how you were doing.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.020
Then I found out recently.

14:57.160 --> 14:59.130
Why didn't you call me first?

14:59.730 --> 15:00.990
Hey, come here.

15:01.160 --> 15:03.630
Why are you just standing there?

15:03.770 --> 15:06.800
I'm the first person who recognized you.

15:07.400 --> 15:10.300
We're artistic companions. Don't disappoint me.

15:10.300 --> 15:11.370
You are...

15:13.370 --> 15:14.940
A fraud.

15:18.350 --> 15:19.710
Wow.

15:20.450 --> 15:22.950
The little kid grew up, huh?

15:23.420 --> 15:26.020
I can't believe you're talking like that to me.

15:26.520 --> 15:29.190
In the past, you always called me "Director."

15:30.860 --> 15:31.660
Why...

15:33.030 --> 15:34.770
Why are you here again?

15:36.160 --> 15:37.330
It's all over.

15:37.330 --> 15:38.330
Over?

15:38.430 --> 15:39.730
How can it be over?

15:40.100 --> 15:44.240
When you ruined my film with your terrible acting?

15:44.340 --> 15:46.240
You're so shameless.

15:46.720 --> 15:48.340
I thought about it.

15:48.340 --> 15:50.040
The problem was you.

15:50.040 --> 15:52.680
If you had just done the method acting,

15:52.680 --> 15:54.250
we could've premiered in theaters.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.250
I'll give you a chance to make up for it.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.050
Work with me.

16:00.860 --> 16:02.690
I also did some self-reflection.

16:02.690 --> 16:04.930
I also needed method acting.

16:05.090 --> 16:07.860
So the script I'm writing is about us.

16:07.860 --> 16:10.030
A rookie actress who can't tell the difference

16:10.030 --> 16:11.130
between art and pornography

16:11.130 --> 16:14.010
and a director who doubts himself

16:14.040 --> 16:15.280
because of her.

16:15.300 --> 16:16.740
What do you think? Awesome, right?

16:16.740 --> 16:18.740
I'll go to the Cannes with this.

16:18.740 --> 16:21.210
I'll start the first scene here.

16:21.440 --> 16:22.640
About there.

16:22.740 --> 16:24.450
A woman is standing with her fair skin bare.

16:24.450 --> 16:26.210
The sky is so blue, it's transparent.

16:26.210 --> 16:28.880
Below is the people living their daily lives.

16:28.880 --> 16:30.520
The camera pans up again.

16:30.520 --> 16:32.490
It goes over her fair nude body.

16:32.490 --> 16:33.550
On her sorrowful face.

16:33.550 --> 16:35.520
Down her slender long neck.

16:35.520 --> 16:37.430
Then down her fair...

16:37.430 --> 16:38.690
No!

16:39.130 --> 16:40.460
Yikes.

16:40.830 --> 16:43.400
I'm telling you, we'll make it big this time.

16:43.400 --> 16:46.970
I'm the only one who can reveal your true value.

16:47.700 --> 16:49.440
Why is it me?

16:49.870 --> 16:52.170
Why is it always me?

16:52.170 --> 16:54.340
You're my muse.

16:54.340 --> 16:55.910
You're my persona.

16:55.910 --> 16:57.950
I'll make you successful.

16:57.950 --> 16:59.580
Trust me this time.

16:59.810 --> 17:01.420
I have great plans.

17:06.190 --> 17:07.119
I...

17:10.160 --> 17:11.690
was a minor then.

17:11.690 --> 17:12.660
That's why

17:12.660 --> 17:14.859
I'm saying we should do it again now.

17:15.130 --> 17:18.470
You've come to an age where you know things.

17:18.630 --> 17:20.300
I'll get the production costs soon.

17:20.300 --> 17:22.300
So you wrap up what you're doing now.

17:22.300 --> 17:24.310
Idol group, my foot.

17:25.210 --> 17:27.040
Jeez.

17:34.020 --> 17:35.880
I'm using this, okay?

17:38.950 --> 17:41.020
I'll pay you back, so don't worry.

17:41.360 --> 17:42.220
Here.

17:43.990 --> 17:44.790
Here.

17:46.560 --> 17:47.760
Jeez.

17:49.560 --> 17:50.600
Thanks for this.

18:09.820 --> 18:10.920
Stella!

18:12.690 --> 18:15.360
Our fans gave us all these?

18:15.420 --> 18:16.820
Incredible.

18:17.220 --> 18:18.290
Put them here.

18:18.290 --> 18:20.490
- Okay.
- Thank you.

18:22.900 --> 18:24.670
Will all this go in?

18:26.570 --> 18:27.940
Of course!

18:32.610 --> 18:33.940
Ta-da!

18:35.310 --> 18:37.010
Ta-da!

18:38.110 --> 18:39.450
Wow!

18:39.450 --> 18:40.720
Amazing!

18:40.720 --> 18:42.380
Wow, it's awesome!

18:42.380 --> 18:43.880
I'll help you.

18:47.090 --> 18:48.190
Thanks.

18:50.020 --> 18:51.160
Chae-ah.

18:51.160 --> 18:51.790
Yes?

18:51.790 --> 18:55.630
I made a song to put on a sound platform.

18:56.300 --> 18:58.400
Can you feature in it?

18:59.300 --> 18:59.870
Me?

18:59.870 --> 19:01.000
Yes.

19:02.470 --> 19:03.800
Why me...?

19:04.640 --> 19:06.140
I'm not that good.

19:06.140 --> 19:07.680
It's not difficult.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.210
Ask Elle.

19:09.410 --> 19:10.810
She's good.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.810
She's done a lot of featuring.

19:13.980 --> 19:15.660
Why are you asking her?

19:15.950 --> 19:16.550
What?

19:16.550 --> 19:17.690
Don't you know

19:17.690 --> 19:20.220
we're trying to suck up to Calla?

19:20.790 --> 19:22.460
How can you be so slow-witted?

19:22.560 --> 19:24.590
Oh...Okay.

19:25.030 --> 19:26.330
I'm sorry.

19:34.870 --> 19:36.900
Jeez, this is frustrating.

19:36.900 --> 19:38.710
Why was it four?

19:38.870 --> 19:41.080
Dan reminded me of it.

19:42.440 --> 19:44.450
Since we got a new car,

19:44.610 --> 19:47.520
I want to go somewhere to get fresh air.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.520
Want to go?

19:49.250 --> 19:50.820
How can we?

19:51.150 --> 19:53.390
If I had that time, I'd go see my grandma.

19:53.390 --> 19:55.790
You'll be able to see her all you want soon.

19:55.790 --> 19:57.090
These days,

19:57.090 --> 19:59.060
she's been acting strangely.

19:59.230 --> 20:01.560
When I call her, she keeps telling me to hang up.

20:02.230 --> 20:04.570
She says it's her bedtime. But it's not.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.900
Should I ask her to interpret my dream?

20:08.500 --> 20:09.640
Not that she's an expert.

20:09.640 --> 20:10.910
Then why?

20:11.410 --> 20:13.110
I'll feel at ease.

20:14.180 --> 20:18.480
If she were right, I'd be Billie Eilish by now.

20:19.050 --> 20:21.820
To your grandma, you're the best.

20:23.280 --> 20:26.390
I wish my mom was like your grandma.

20:37.830 --> 20:38.930
Stella!

20:50.240 --> 20:51.680
Give us a moment.

20:51.880 --> 20:52.710
Huh?

20:54.150 --> 20:55.050
Okay.

21:00.390 --> 21:01.520
Is it that bastard?

21:03.520 --> 21:04.520
Is it?

21:18.540 --> 21:20.780
Why are you suddenly quitting?

21:20.840 --> 21:22.640
It's only been three months.

21:22.640 --> 21:24.880
There's something I didn't tell you.

21:26.180 --> 21:27.920
I can't be here.

21:29.250 --> 21:30.950
I'm different from you.

21:40.190 --> 21:41.630
What do you mean?

21:42.100 --> 21:44.170
I didn't know when I followed you here.

21:45.530 --> 21:47.600
But being with you girls, I can tell.

21:48.370 --> 21:49.370
You might

21:50.140 --> 21:52.670
not be able to debut because of me.

21:53.640 --> 21:55.680
Even if you do, it might get difficult.

21:58.950 --> 21:59.880
I have to go.

22:00.750 --> 22:01.580
I hope

22:02.980 --> 22:04.550
you debut and be successful.

22:10.790 --> 22:12.560
I can't let you go like this.

22:13.930 --> 22:15.160
I'll hear you out

22:16.030 --> 22:18.000
then let go if I think I should.

22:23.140 --> 22:24.140
Stella...

22:29.380 --> 22:30.540
That movie

22:30.810 --> 22:32.450
wasn't for the theaters.

22:33.850 --> 22:36.150
You said the video service didn't work either.

22:36.750 --> 22:38.720
He even got drunk and deleted all the data.

22:38.720 --> 22:39.590
What's more,

22:39.590 --> 22:40.750
the external hard drive

22:41.060 --> 22:42.660
got burnt in a fire.

22:42.820 --> 22:44.960
Someone might've seen it.

22:46.690 --> 22:49.300
The guy at the club Hyun-ji fought with.

22:49.460 --> 22:51.270
He said he recognized me from somewhere.

22:54.700 --> 22:55.840
What did he say?

22:56.000 --> 22:57.270
Why did he come back?

22:57.770 --> 22:58.940
Does he want money?

23:01.510 --> 23:02.540
He wants

23:02.880 --> 23:04.480
to work with me again.

23:06.310 --> 23:08.250
He told me to wrap up Cotton Candy.

23:08.720 --> 23:09.720
What?

23:17.290 --> 23:18.230
So?

23:18.330 --> 23:19.490
What did you do?

23:22.200 --> 23:23.660
Did you do as we practiced?

23:23.660 --> 23:25.070
You looked him in the eye

23:25.730 --> 23:27.070
and told him firmly, right?

23:27.070 --> 23:29.240
You told him you're not the old Stella, right?

23:29.940 --> 23:31.240
You told him to get lost, right?

23:31.440 --> 23:33.110
We practiced a lot.

23:36.180 --> 23:37.240
Stella...

23:38.210 --> 23:40.250
It was no use.

23:41.050 --> 23:43.220
Once I saw his face...

23:43.580 --> 23:44.650
I returned

23:46.250 --> 23:48.660
to the idiot I used to be.

23:48.660 --> 23:50.690
Get a grip, Stella.

23:50.690 --> 23:52.760
He's just a pathetic fraud.

23:53.260 --> 23:55.600
He's not as great as you think he is.

23:55.830 --> 23:58.170
What if he blabs about my past?

23:59.400 --> 24:00.330
Then

24:00.700 --> 24:02.440
people will know.

24:03.640 --> 24:05.000
And the others...

24:07.840 --> 24:08.940
They

24:08.940 --> 24:10.340
might round Cotton Candy up

24:10.340 --> 24:11.750
- and say we're all filthy...
- Stella!

24:13.380 --> 24:14.250
Okay.

24:14.980 --> 24:16.920
Being in an adult film when you were young.

24:17.990 --> 24:20.050
That is the only fact.

24:21.160 --> 24:22.920
Besides, that wasn't even your fault!

24:23.360 --> 24:24.690
He tricked a young girl,

24:24.690 --> 24:26.690
drugged her and filmed you. He's the bastard!

24:26.690 --> 24:28.800
It was my fault that I got tricked.

24:29.100 --> 24:31.600
It was my fault that I got tricked.

24:34.540 --> 24:36.240
I said it's not!

24:36.970 --> 24:38.210
If he harasses you again, let's report him.

24:38.210 --> 24:39.910
No!

24:40.940 --> 24:42.240
Don't do that.

24:42.380 --> 24:45.110
If the press finds out, you know what'll happen.

24:46.180 --> 24:48.080
Don't tell the others.

24:50.650 --> 24:51.820
I...

24:55.020 --> 24:56.920
I hate that I'm different from you.

24:56.920 --> 24:59.490
Why do you think you're different from us?

25:05.800 --> 25:07.570
Why is it so hard to reach Ae-rin

25:07.570 --> 25:10.640
these days? She won't pick up her phone.

25:10.640 --> 25:12.270
What if something happened to her?

25:13.210 --> 25:14.310
What's wrong?

25:31.360 --> 25:32.630
Did something happen?

25:55.480 --> 25:58.380
I thought I was the most unfortunate person.

26:01.120 --> 26:03.620
I would've struck a deal with the devil

26:04.790 --> 26:06.760
if I could remove my dad from my life.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.930
That crazy pervert!

26:14.200 --> 26:15.700
Let's just report him!

26:22.340 --> 26:24.850
He didn't threaten her for money.

26:24.850 --> 26:27.010
He didn't stalk her severely.

26:27.350 --> 26:29.480
He didn't upload the video on the internet.

26:30.350 --> 26:32.920
It'll take a long time to prove his crime.

26:33.690 --> 26:36.090
In the meantime, word will get out.

26:36.860 --> 26:38.090
It'll be exaggerated.

26:38.730 --> 26:40.460
All kinds of rumors will be added.

26:44.770 --> 26:46.170
That snake...

27:08.490 --> 27:09.490
Mom...

27:12.690 --> 27:13.660
What?

27:13.990 --> 27:15.500
What is it this time?

27:16.060 --> 27:17.060
Well...

27:17.760 --> 27:19.630
I have to pay for after-school activity

27:19.630 --> 27:21.640
and lunch by tomorrow.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.740
Your father was supposed to send you that.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.410
He didn't send it? Call him.

27:26.410 --> 27:27.570
I did.

27:28.240 --> 27:30.810
But he's vacationing with his family right now.

27:31.550 --> 27:32.610
He's in Europe.

27:32.610 --> 27:34.050
That bastard...

27:34.050 --> 27:36.850
You should've told your father in advance!

27:36.850 --> 27:39.420
Don't you know he always procrastinates?

27:39.620 --> 27:40.850
I'm sorry.

27:41.820 --> 27:43.960
Oh, and...

27:45.890 --> 27:48.360
I need to pay rent.

27:48.360 --> 27:50.760
Your dad was supposed to send you money.

27:50.760 --> 27:52.130
He didn't send you that either?

27:52.870 --> 27:53.770
No.

27:54.900 --> 27:57.740
I asked the landlady to give me a few more days.

27:57.740 --> 27:59.110
But she said no...

28:00.670 --> 28:02.510
When the contract is up, move somewhere else.

28:02.510 --> 28:05.450
She's so rigid.

28:05.780 --> 28:06.880
And you...

28:07.350 --> 28:09.980
Did you call Se-hoon out and buy him snacks?

28:09.980 --> 28:10.880
What?

28:12.220 --> 28:13.650
Oh, yes...

28:13.790 --> 28:15.360
I got my part time pay.

28:16.190 --> 28:18.530
If you have the money, pay for your lunch.

28:19.430 --> 28:21.160
Don't call Se-hoon out.

28:21.460 --> 28:23.000
His dad doesn't like it.

28:23.560 --> 28:24.560
I know

28:24.670 --> 28:26.970
even a half-brother is precious to you,

28:26.970 --> 28:28.800
but he's fond of you now because he's young.

28:28.800 --> 28:29.640
Once he gets older,

28:29.640 --> 28:31.310
you'll be worse than strangers.

28:32.170 --> 28:34.640
Our relationship isn't any better.

28:36.080 --> 28:39.580
When you grow up, you have to be independent.

28:39.580 --> 28:41.420
I have a family now.

28:41.420 --> 28:44.320
We'll meet less, and things will be awkward.

28:48.890 --> 28:51.660
This will sound harsh, but it's for your own good.

28:51.830 --> 28:53.290
You need to be self-reliable!

28:53.290 --> 28:55.030
Have a dream and work for it!

28:56.560 --> 28:58.700
What about becoming an actress?

29:00.200 --> 29:02.840
I gave birth to a pretty daughter!

29:02.840 --> 29:04.710
Why can't you do something with that beauty?

29:04.870 --> 29:07.170
If you keep relying on us,

29:07.370 --> 29:09.180
what will you be when you graduate?

29:17.180 --> 29:18.420
You idiot...

29:40.840 --> 29:41.880
By the way...

29:41.880 --> 29:43.410
Why did Stella and Jenna fight?

29:43.410 --> 29:45.050
Was it because of what happened yesterday?

29:45.450 --> 29:46.610
They didn't fight.

29:47.180 --> 29:48.120
Get ready.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.120
We don't have much time.

29:49.780 --> 29:50.950
Looks good.

29:51.690 --> 29:53.520
I'm finished getting ready.

30:16.540 --> 30:17.540
Jenna.

30:32.490 --> 30:33.690
I'm scared.

30:35.530 --> 30:36.930
But I'll fight.

30:52.010 --> 30:53.680
I'll fight with you.

30:55.620 --> 30:57.450
We'll succeed if we fight with our lives.

30:58.550 --> 30:59.890
Just like we always have.

31:16.170 --> 31:17.910
- What do you think?
- It's good.

31:17.910 --> 31:18.870
What about you?

31:19.340 --> 31:19.970
Not bad.

31:19.970 --> 31:21.210
- Hey!
- Hey!

31:22.480 --> 31:24.480
You know that's the worst thing to say, right?

31:25.010 --> 31:27.180
What? It's not bad, so that's what I said.

31:27.810 --> 31:28.750
Should I have said it's good

31:28.750 --> 31:29.780
when I feel like it's not bad?

31:29.880 --> 31:30.350
Not the worst?

31:30.350 --> 31:32.320
Forget it.

31:32.490 --> 31:34.170
Are you an AI or what?

31:35.120 --> 31:36.190
Jeez.

31:36.920 --> 31:38.060
Let's revise it to this.

31:38.060 --> 31:39.160
Finally, a pass?

31:39.160 --> 31:41.930
It's easier without Jenna.

31:42.230 --> 31:44.160
You two keep fighting.

31:44.160 --> 31:46.030
It was so awkward for me in the middle.

31:46.030 --> 31:47.570
We were exchanging opinions.

31:47.930 --> 31:49.440
We weren't fighting.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.610
Kim Jenna

31:52.140 --> 31:53.870
We're meeting him today.

31:53.870 --> 31:55.640
Take care of our schedule for me.

31:59.180 --> 32:00.280
Tell Stella

32:00.980 --> 32:02.550
not to lose to him.

32:02.880 --> 32:03.880
Tell her we got her back.

32:03.880 --> 32:04.890
I'm here.

32:04.890 --> 32:05.990
Come on in.

32:05.990 --> 32:07.850
Elle, where's Chae-ah?

32:08.220 --> 32:09.860
- Chae-ah?
- What?

32:11.930 --> 32:13.160
Are you really

32:13.490 --> 32:15.300
going to reject Dan's request?

32:15.800 --> 32:16.360
What?

32:16.360 --> 32:17.560
What request?

32:18.370 --> 32:19.370
Oh...

32:19.530 --> 32:20.770
Dan asked Chae-ah to...

32:20.770 --> 32:21.700
Oh!

32:22.300 --> 32:24.100
Elle will do it.

32:24.740 --> 32:26.070
Don't worry.

32:30.710 --> 32:32.610
I don't know what's going on.

32:32.610 --> 32:33.810
But I won't do it.

32:36.450 --> 32:38.450
If you listen to the song,

32:38.690 --> 32:40.550
you'll know why he asked you.

32:41.560 --> 32:42.090
But...

32:42.090 --> 32:44.420
I don't believe you people.

32:44.420 --> 32:47.130
I said we have to suck up to Calla!

32:47.130 --> 32:49.160
Your flat refusal

32:49.160 --> 32:51.330
has Dan totally depressed.

32:51.600 --> 32:53.430
What? Why?

32:54.000 --> 32:55.040
What happened to Dan?

32:55.040 --> 32:57.470
He said he'll never write a song again.

33:06.780 --> 33:08.420
Why can't you do it?

33:08.420 --> 33:10.480
I know what Dan's fans will say.

33:10.480 --> 33:12.450
That I mooched off of my team,

33:12.790 --> 33:14.860
and now I'm mooching off of Dan.

33:14.860 --> 33:15.920
Are you a psychic or what?

33:15.920 --> 33:16.960
I know.

33:17.520 --> 33:18.890
I'm pathetic.

33:20.330 --> 33:22.800
But talented people like you don't know.

33:23.660 --> 33:24.230
I even

33:24.230 --> 33:25.600
heard people say

33:26.570 --> 33:29.370
I was born mooching off of my sister.

33:30.840 --> 33:32.410
That I have

33:33.110 --> 33:34.510
a moocher's DNA inside of me.

33:34.510 --> 33:36.510
Is that important to you right now?

33:37.980 --> 33:39.150
You...

33:42.120 --> 33:43.120
So?

33:43.320 --> 33:44.820
Do you pity yourself?

33:45.950 --> 33:46.320
What?

33:46.320 --> 33:48.660
You said you don't want to feel sorry for yourself.

33:49.460 --> 33:50.990
But look at your actions.

33:50.990 --> 33:52.390
Your actions are the exact opposite.

33:52.390 --> 33:52.960
Elle.

33:52.960 --> 33:54.330
Answer me!

33:55.360 --> 33:58.570
Do people say that because you mooch off?

33:59.200 --> 34:01.900
Or do you mooch off because people say that?

34:04.840 --> 34:06.710
Think hard what comes first.

34:18.150 --> 34:19.190
Chae-ah.

34:23.790 --> 34:24.929
Chae-ah.

34:28.400 --> 34:29.400
Troy.

34:31.570 --> 34:33.670
I can't do it without practice.

34:34.670 --> 34:36.600
But there's no time.

34:38.310 --> 34:40.909
Dan asked me because he felt sorry for me.

34:41.440 --> 34:42.710
He's kind.

34:43.909 --> 34:45.650
What you need right now...

34:46.380 --> 34:47.650
Is it practice?

34:47.650 --> 34:49.679
Is it assurance? Is it the truth?

34:52.020 --> 34:53.690
I'll listen to Dan's song.

34:54.520 --> 34:56.420
Then I'll see if Dan was right.

34:57.320 --> 34:58.960
Or if it was just out of good will.

35:00.590 --> 35:01.800
Troy.

35:01.800 --> 35:03.700
I won't blindly take your side

35:04.500 --> 35:06.730
just to cheer you up.

35:07.630 --> 35:08.970
Let's find out now.

35:10.340 --> 35:12.210
If you're useful or not.

35:12.940 --> 35:13.940
No.

35:14.680 --> 35:15.710
Don't.

35:17.340 --> 35:19.110
It'll all be over soon.

35:19.110 --> 35:20.390
Why do we have to do that?

36:09.960 --> 36:11.640
You brought a friend?

36:12.270 --> 36:15.240
She must be an aspiring actress, too.

36:16.370 --> 36:17.240
Sit.

36:26.150 --> 36:27.580
Let's see.

36:30.580 --> 36:32.350
The glitter in your eyes is good.

36:32.350 --> 36:33.490
Great.

36:35.520 --> 36:36.520
Wait.

36:36.860 --> 36:38.460
You look familiar.

36:39.190 --> 36:40.390
Oh!

36:41.690 --> 36:44.160
She's the leader, right?

36:44.630 --> 36:46.570
Don't contact Stella anymore.

36:46.570 --> 36:48.800
Huh? What did you say?

36:50.370 --> 36:51.240
Hey.

36:52.510 --> 36:54.570
What is she talking about?

37:04.050 --> 37:05.420
Do you want money?

37:05.420 --> 37:06.220
Money?

37:06.240 --> 37:07.860
Ha!

37:08.390 --> 37:11.090
You insult me.

37:11.090 --> 37:13.160
I guess you don't understand

37:13.160 --> 37:14.960
because you're in the commercial art field,

37:14.960 --> 37:18.330
but I believe money corrupts art.

37:19.830 --> 37:22.740
I came to tell it to you straight.

37:23.140 --> 37:24.900
I'm not your tool.

37:24.900 --> 37:27.270
You have nothing to do with me.

37:27.470 --> 37:30.910
So if you keep harassing me, I'll report you!

37:36.220 --> 37:37.220
What a headache.

37:39.720 --> 37:41.160
Hey, Actress Jang.

37:41.350 --> 37:43.790
How can you say I have nothing to do with you?

37:43.790 --> 37:45.290
I told you.

37:45.290 --> 37:47.330
You're my persona.

37:47.330 --> 37:48.630
Stop that crap!

37:48.630 --> 37:51.460
Yikes. Why are you all so crude?

37:51.460 --> 37:52.660
So undignified.

37:54.670 --> 37:55.800
Stella.

37:56.440 --> 37:58.640
If you want to be an idol, then do it.

37:59.110 --> 38:00.740
Dreams can change.

38:00.740 --> 38:02.840
It's a shame, though.

38:03.940 --> 38:06.610
I'll just have to change my plans.

38:07.650 --> 38:10.880
How about a win-win situation?

38:12.820 --> 38:13.490
What are you talking about?

38:13.490 --> 38:14.720
It looks like

38:15.120 --> 38:17.360
you're trying to draw attention with issues.

38:17.360 --> 38:19.890
People are very interested in

38:20.360 --> 38:21.960
the day you'll release your song.

38:21.960 --> 38:24.660
So let's announce your casting on that day.

38:24.660 --> 38:26.900
Then we'll get a synergy effect.

38:29.500 --> 38:30.270
What?

38:33.540 --> 38:34.470
Let's go.

38:34.870 --> 38:35.940
Do whatever you want.

38:35.940 --> 38:38.580
You think Stella's past is her weakness?

38:39.580 --> 38:41.480
How was that past made?

38:41.820 --> 38:44.020
You tricked a child, saying it's an art film.

38:44.020 --> 38:45.520
You drugged her and filmed it.

38:45.520 --> 38:46.850
That's a crime.

38:47.720 --> 38:48.820
A crime?

38:51.720 --> 38:53.330
You're insulting me again.

38:53.330 --> 38:54.260
Hey.

38:54.860 --> 38:56.530
Don't you know the world has changed?

38:57.160 --> 38:59.600
We're more than capable of persuading people.

38:59.600 --> 39:00.800
Stella will

39:01.100 --> 39:04.300
no longer live as a hostage to the past you made.

39:09.240 --> 39:10.180
Let's go.

39:11.610 --> 39:14.150
Will you really be able to persuade people?

39:15.380 --> 39:16.620
Stella.

39:17.380 --> 39:19.350
I made a mistake,

39:19.550 --> 39:22.260
and our film disappeared without a trace.

39:27.530 --> 39:31.100
So that's why my Stella has no sense of reality.

39:31.100 --> 39:32.330
You know,

39:32.630 --> 39:33.970
I have

39:34.330 --> 39:36.370
a behind-the-scene clip.

39:37.070 --> 39:38.140
To boot,

39:38.910 --> 39:41.240
it's my favorite scene.

40:04.800 --> 40:05.830
Stella.

40:06.030 --> 40:07.030
Calm down.

40:07.170 --> 40:08.330
It's over.

40:09.100 --> 40:10.270
Stella!

40:10.470 --> 40:12.670
Hearing about it and seeing it are different.

40:12.770 --> 40:14.370
It's a totally different situation now.

40:14.740 --> 40:16.540
If it's a behind-the-scene clip...

40:18.980 --> 40:20.110
I'll leave.

40:21.110 --> 40:22.450
Let me disappear.

40:24.750 --> 40:25.820
Jenna...

40:26.950 --> 40:27.990
Please...

40:27.990 --> 40:30.160
I'm begging you...

40:36.100 --> 40:36.960
Stella.

40:37.600 --> 40:38.730
Look at me.

40:39.370 --> 40:40.900
Look at me.

40:44.040 --> 40:45.440
We can fix this.

40:46.970 --> 40:48.780
Get a grip.

40:49.040 --> 40:50.180
No.

40:50.180 --> 40:51.410
No, no.

40:51.410 --> 40:52.850
I can disappear.

40:53.250 --> 40:55.980
It'll be okay if he can't find me.

41:00.390 --> 41:02.060
Will you run your whole life?

41:02.060 --> 41:04.290
Yes. I will.

41:04.590 --> 41:06.930
What's the use of fixing this situation?

41:07.660 --> 41:10.460
As long as the video exists, there's no fixing it.

41:11.660 --> 41:13.070
I have to die.

41:13.330 --> 41:14.800
Or I have to kill him.

41:14.800 --> 41:15.940
It's one or the other.

41:23.610 --> 41:24.940
Let's solve this together.

41:27.210 --> 41:28.410
All of us.

41:36.120 --> 41:37.560
It's okay.

41:41.830 --> 41:43.160
It's okay.

41:47.030 --> 41:48.370
What...?

41:48.800 --> 41:51.340
Poor Stella...

41:54.110 --> 41:55.010
Let's kill him.

41:55.010 --> 41:55.740
- Come on.
- Hey!

41:55.740 --> 41:56.810
Hyun-ji!

41:56.810 --> 41:57.910
Let go!

41:57.910 --> 42:01.010
We can't sit still. We must do something!

42:01.250 --> 42:02.770
Let's tell CEO Cha.

42:02.950 --> 42:05.250
He'll do something.

42:08.490 --> 42:09.490
No.

42:12.690 --> 42:14.130
We must fix this ourselves.

42:14.430 --> 42:15.630
Ourselves?

42:16.400 --> 42:17.530
How?

42:34.750 --> 42:36.780
Will this really work?

42:36.780 --> 42:37.880
It will.

42:39.390 --> 42:40.990
He's a dimwit.

42:40.990 --> 42:42.860
So there will be clues everywhere.

42:43.560 --> 42:45.360
You know the first keywords I gave you, right?

42:45.690 --> 42:46.530
Let's divide them and search.

42:46.530 --> 42:48.460
Once you find a piece,

42:49.100 --> 42:50.730
let that lead you to another clue.

42:51.160 --> 42:53.900
Let's start with finding out who he is.

42:54.700 --> 42:55.770
Okay.

42:59.070 --> 43:01.070
I already found a piece.

43:02.240 --> 43:04.080
He's such a blockhead.

43:04.080 --> 43:07.650
The googling skills I mastered while tracking trolls

43:08.480 --> 43:10.180
will come in handy.

43:14.020 --> 43:16.090
Director Kim Ho-Yong

43:25.300 --> 43:26.600
Did you get something?

43:26.600 --> 43:28.400
Kim Ho-yong's social media

43:28.400 --> 43:31.300
"A Connection Formed with a Touch" Director

43:36.840 --> 43:37.640
What?

43:38.950 --> 43:39.510
You got something?

43:39.510 --> 43:40.310
Yes.

43:40.310 --> 43:41.950
I found something on a weird website.

43:41.950 --> 43:43.320
It's him, right?

43:43.320 --> 43:44.550
Right?

43:51.790 --> 43:53.660
Chae-ah, you look this up.

43:53.660 --> 43:55.060
And you, Hyun-ji, should...

43:55.060 --> 43:57.900
I'm the only one who can reveal your true value

43:57.900 --> 43:58.530
to the world.

43:58.530 --> 43:59.500
Just like old times, huh?

43:59.500 --> 44:02.200
Entrust me with your dream.

44:02.200 --> 44:04.970
How can you say I have nothing to do with you?

44:04.970 --> 44:06.110
I told you.

44:06.110 --> 44:07.810
You're my persona.

44:07.810 --> 44:08.940
Stella will

44:08.940 --> 44:12.180
no longer live as a hostage to the past you made.

44:19.250 --> 44:21.390
I don't know what you're doing right now,

44:24.020 --> 44:25.320
but count me in.

44:35.900 --> 44:38.040
I'm glad Stella plucked up courage.

44:39.710 --> 44:40.810
Yeah.

44:42.480 --> 44:43.510
Jenna.

44:47.010 --> 44:48.050
This all happened

44:48.050 --> 44:50.480
because Cotton Candy got famous.

44:51.750 --> 44:53.090
If we don't succeed tomorrow

44:53.720 --> 44:55.720
and if it looks like Stella will get hurt,

44:56.520 --> 44:57.520
let's...

44:58.520 --> 45:00.930
Give up our goal to disband at the music show.

45:03.330 --> 45:04.610
Let's stop here.

45:08.270 --> 45:11.070
Why did Dan suddenly make that request?

45:11.070 --> 45:11.900
Why?

45:11.900 --> 45:13.140
Does it seem like he was being patronizing?

45:13.710 --> 45:16.040
You give him too much credit.

45:16.310 --> 45:18.010
Dan doesn't think too much.

45:18.010 --> 45:20.380
If he wants to do it, he just goes for it.

45:24.750 --> 45:26.020
I opened the file. Listen.

45:26.020 --> 45:27.250
Okay. Is this it?

45:27.250 --> 45:28.020
Yeah.

45:29.390 --> 45:30.520
Play it.

45:33.790 --> 45:34.760
Oh, Sir.

45:34.760 --> 45:36.800
We got word from

45:36.800 --> 45:38.500
the K-pop Arena Consortium.

45:38.500 --> 45:39.870
Yikes!

45:40.030 --> 45:42.070
You jumped out of nowhere!

45:42.070 --> 45:43.200
You think you're an elk?

45:43.200 --> 45:44.240
I almost hit you.

45:44.240 --> 45:46.770
What's the schedule for the Starpeace kids' camp?

45:47.470 --> 45:48.470
Why do you want to know that?

45:48.470 --> 45:50.680
The first round of auditions have ended.

45:50.680 --> 45:52.550
Yes. Why do you want to know?

45:52.550 --> 45:54.750
You got a civil complaint, right?

45:54.910 --> 45:55.820
No.

45:55.820 --> 45:58.550
Can I get the list of the ones who passed?

45:58.980 --> 45:59.990
Jenna.

45:59.990 --> 46:01.650
You must have misunderstood me.

46:01.650 --> 46:03.360
Of course not.

46:03.360 --> 46:05.360
Then can you tell me if a certain person passed?

46:06.760 --> 46:07.360
Jenna.

46:07.360 --> 46:09.460
There's no way of knowing and I can't tell you.

46:09.460 --> 46:12.000
I don't think you have time to worry about that.

46:13.830 --> 46:15.530
I have a favor to ask of you.

46:15.700 --> 46:17.970
That darned favor asking...

46:17.970 --> 46:19.870
Stop asking for favors.

46:24.040 --> 46:25.040
Yeah.

46:25.580 --> 46:26.950
I got everything covered here.

46:27.150 --> 46:28.450
Are you guys ready, too?

46:29.980 --> 46:30.980
Okay.

46:31.350 --> 46:32.950
Let's end this.

46:37.460 --> 46:38.790
She won't do it?

46:39.260 --> 46:40.490
No, she won't.

46:41.990 --> 46:43.330
Bring Stella.

46:43.330 --> 46:45.570
I want to talk to her.

46:45.570 --> 46:47.170
I relayed the message clearly.

46:47.170 --> 46:48.870
What if

46:49.470 --> 46:51.640
the behind-the-scene clip

46:51.640 --> 46:53.240
spreads with Stella's name on it?

46:53.970 --> 46:55.010
Are you scared?

46:55.510 --> 46:57.910
So why act so tough?

46:58.380 --> 47:00.550
With that pure and innocent face,

47:00.550 --> 47:02.450
Stella filmed an X-rated movie.

47:02.450 --> 47:03.720
What do you think will happen?

47:04.080 --> 47:05.990
You know how entrancing Stella looks

47:05.990 --> 47:08.020
when she's high on drugs?

47:17.360 --> 47:18.860
How much do you want?

47:19.060 --> 47:20.070
Hey.

47:20.870 --> 47:22.230
How many times do I have to tell you?

47:22.230 --> 47:23.840
I don't need money.

47:23.840 --> 47:24.700
Bring Stella.

47:24.700 --> 47:26.440
So how much?

47:27.270 --> 47:29.010
I know you need money.

47:29.340 --> 47:31.010
Let's not waste each other's time.

47:37.150 --> 47:38.150
About...

47:38.780 --> 47:39.550
KRW 50 mil.?

47:39.550 --> 47:40.550
KRW 50 mil.?

47:41.650 --> 47:42.220
Okay.

47:42.220 --> 47:43.220
No, no.

47:43.360 --> 47:44.360
Umm...

47:45.490 --> 47:46.160
KRW 100 mil.

47:46.160 --> 47:46.930
KRW 100 mil.?

47:47.490 --> 47:47.890
Okay.

47:47.890 --> 47:49.090
No, no.

47:49.090 --> 47:50.130
Wait, wait.

47:50.130 --> 47:51.930
Give me some time to think.

47:53.900 --> 47:54.900
About...

47:55.670 --> 47:56.670
KRW 200 mil.

47:56.900 --> 47:58.370
No, KRW 300 mil.

47:58.600 --> 48:00.170
How about KRW 500 mil.?

48:00.670 --> 48:01.640
Or KRW 1 bil.?

48:02.580 --> 48:03.780
KRW 10 bil.?

48:13.120 --> 48:14.390
Kim Ho-Yong.

48:14.550 --> 48:15.720
Age 52.

48:16.020 --> 48:18.320
7 years since you divorced your wife.

48:18.520 --> 48:20.430
Now living out of study rooms.

48:20.430 --> 48:21.330
What?

48:21.330 --> 48:22.800
Majored in film directing.

48:22.800 --> 48:25.360
Flunked twice, graduated after 6 years.

48:25.360 --> 48:26.830
Exempt from military service.

48:26.830 --> 48:29.800
Began film work as a scripter in 2000.

48:29.800 --> 48:31.140
Got married in 2005.

48:31.140 --> 48:34.110
Debuted as a director for a film in 2007.

48:34.110 --> 48:35.640
But got replaced immediately.

48:35.640 --> 48:38.010
Was jobless for a year.

48:38.440 --> 48:40.380
Failed in all the script contests that year.

48:40.380 --> 48:42.310
By being an assistant director

48:42.310 --> 48:44.080
in the parody film of the 2007 film,

48:44.080 --> 48:45.550
got out of being jobless.

48:45.890 --> 48:47.920
Didn't get any follow-up film offers,

48:47.920 --> 48:48.520
so became jobless again.

48:48.520 --> 48:50.420
Signed a contract with "Pink Movie,"

48:50.420 --> 48:52.490
an adult film production company in 2009.

48:52.490 --> 48:55.430
Excessive acting directing led to actors quitting.

48:55.430 --> 48:56.600
Got kicked out.

48:56.760 --> 48:57.830
Should we go on?

48:59.430 --> 49:00.470
Movie?

49:00.870 --> 49:01.670
Art?

49:01.670 --> 49:02.800
The Cannes?

49:03.340 --> 49:05.570
What a load of bull crap.

49:07.410 --> 49:08.270
Hey, Stella...

49:08.270 --> 49:10.580
Want to know how we found out?

49:10.580 --> 49:12.480
Kim Ho-Yong told us himself.

49:12.480 --> 49:14.650
In a script writers' website.

49:14.650 --> 49:16.580
"I Am a Director" website.

49:16.580 --> 49:18.620
"Stories of Life" website.

49:18.620 --> 49:19.890
"Knowledge and People."

49:19.890 --> 49:21.220
The comment section in film-related articles.

49:21.220 --> 49:23.220
Cannes Festival community websites.

49:23.220 --> 49:24.290
"Worst Daily."

49:24.290 --> 49:25.660
"Lonely Divorcé" group.

49:25.660 --> 49:27.330
"I Love My Daughter" group.

49:27.330 --> 49:30.960
Japanese manga website, etc.

49:31.460 --> 49:35.300
You whined all over the place.

49:40.040 --> 49:42.740
You have a daughter that lives with your ex-wife.

49:43.480 --> 49:44.940
She's in 8th grade.

49:45.010 --> 49:46.450
There's a photo of her, too.

49:46.610 --> 49:48.780
"My soul's One Ring."

49:49.620 --> 49:51.350
"My lovely Jung-yeon"?

49:51.950 --> 49:53.820
Even though you can't give her an allowance,

49:53.820 --> 49:55.650
she's proud of you, thinking you're an artist.

49:55.650 --> 49:57.990
Has no idea her dad lured and drugged a minor,

49:57.990 --> 50:00.260
filmed an illegal video, and is threatening her.

50:00.260 --> 50:02.860
Has no idea her dad's a pitiful buffoon.

50:05.630 --> 50:06.800
I'm surprised.

50:06.800 --> 50:08.830
An animal loving its cub.

50:12.000 --> 50:13.410
Jung-yeon's dream is

50:13.540 --> 50:14.970
becoming an idol singer.

50:15.540 --> 50:16.640
So

50:17.110 --> 50:18.640
you're using

50:18.640 --> 50:20.050
a little girl

50:20.050 --> 50:21.550
to threaten me?

50:21.550 --> 50:24.080
Are you even human? Huh?

50:25.120 --> 50:26.120
Jung-yeon

50:25.890 --> 50:26.520
Pick up.

50:26.520 --> 50:27.800
It's our answer.

50:32.560 --> 50:33.390
No.

50:33.390 --> 50:35.030
You'll regret it if you don't.

50:45.600 --> 50:46.600
Dad!

50:47.010 --> 50:49.210
Guess who I'm with!

50:49.380 --> 50:52.180
This is incredible!

50:53.910 --> 50:54.950
You see that?

50:55.280 --> 50:56.950
Do you know where this is?

50:56.950 --> 50:58.850
It's Starpeace!

50:58.850 --> 51:00.350
Awesome, right?

51:00.350 --> 51:01.420
Jung-yeon!

51:01.690 --> 51:03.320
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!

51:05.390 --> 51:07.430
The dance studio is that way.

51:07.430 --> 51:08.490
Okay!

51:08.790 --> 51:09.460
This is my dad.

51:09.460 --> 51:11.100
Say hello, please.

51:11.530 --> 51:13.630
Hello, I'm Cotton Candy's Elle.

51:13.630 --> 51:15.600
Hello, I'm Chae-ah.

51:15.600 --> 51:17.300
Hello, I'm Hyun-ji.

51:17.300 --> 51:18.140
Dad!

51:18.140 --> 51:19.470
The Cotton Candy members

51:19.470 --> 51:23.380
will give me a special vocal and dance lesson!

51:23.380 --> 51:24.640
They said I got eliminated from the audition

51:24.640 --> 51:26.750
for the Starpeace kids' camp by a neck.

51:26.750 --> 51:27.650
I'm so...

51:27.650 --> 51:30.850
I'm so happy I'm going to go crazy!

51:30.850 --> 51:32.990
You know who's my favorite?

51:33.290 --> 51:35.920
Stella!

51:36.420 --> 51:40.290
They don't know if she'll make it today.

51:40.290 --> 51:42.130
I hope she does.

51:42.560 --> 51:44.200
Come on, Jung-yeon! Let's go learn dance moves.

51:44.200 --> 51:44.830
Let's go.

51:44.830 --> 51:45.700
- Okay!
- Let's go!

51:45.700 --> 51:48.000
Dad, I have to go now. Bye!

51:54.270 --> 51:56.540
You probably have no interest,

51:56.780 --> 51:58.640
but she was a boy band fan,

51:58.640 --> 52:00.910
then changed to being a Cotton Candy an.

52:00.910 --> 52:03.650
Because they gave her hope that she could do it.

52:05.050 --> 52:07.560
What will she think if she knew

52:07.590 --> 52:09.660
her dad is threatening us?

52:17.430 --> 52:19.130
This is Jung-yeon's application.

52:20.570 --> 52:22.430
What your daughter likes...

52:22.430 --> 52:24.000
What she dreams...

52:24.200 --> 52:25.670
What kind of person she wants to be...

52:25.670 --> 52:27.240
It's all there.

52:27.810 --> 52:30.140
I'm giving this to you so you'll be a proper dad.

52:30.480 --> 52:35.380
Starpeace Entertainment
2021 Kids' Camp Program Application

52:37.250 --> 52:40.550
Favorite Artist
Cotton Candy (Stella)

52:46.430 --> 52:47.690
It was wrong of me to do it.

52:49.500 --> 52:50.800
I'm sorry.

52:53.900 --> 52:55.600
There's no clip.

52:56.300 --> 52:57.840
I lied.

52:59.440 --> 53:00.670
I think

53:01.940 --> 53:03.880
I did so many bad things to you.

53:04.680 --> 53:05.780
I will never

53:06.080 --> 53:07.810
appear in front of you again.

53:07.980 --> 53:09.310
I won't bother you.

53:10.950 --> 53:11.820
We...

53:11.820 --> 53:13.990
have never met.

53:14.750 --> 53:16.430
You should completely

53:17.520 --> 53:19.200
erase me from your life.

53:22.930 --> 53:24.000
I...

53:24.330 --> 53:25.330
I...

53:26.170 --> 53:28.630
I vow it on my daughter's life, okay?

53:30.640 --> 53:32.070
I've no right to say this

53:35.610 --> 53:37.110
but I hope you live a happy life.

54:08.740 --> 54:10.340
You did well, Stella.

54:16.980 --> 54:18.020
You know...

54:18.020 --> 54:19.890
I'm...

54:20.250 --> 54:21.490
I'm in disbelief, too...

54:21.490 --> 54:22.760
But you...

54:26.560 --> 54:28.490
You got a commercial deal.

54:28.730 --> 54:29.630
Com...

54:30.260 --> 54:31.500
Commercial?

54:31.500 --> 54:33.370
It's the chicken burger shop

54:33.530 --> 54:35.130
where Jenna works.

54:35.130 --> 54:37.600
The chicken burger commercial

54:37.600 --> 54:39.300
that hires only top idols

54:40.040 --> 54:41.570
wants Cotton Candy.

54:41.570 --> 54:44.040
Does this make sense? Jeez.

54:44.040 --> 54:45.180
S...S...S...Seriously?

54:45.180 --> 54:47.150
Yeah. I was shocked, too.

54:52.920 --> 54:53.820
Director Yoon!

54:53.820 --> 54:55.090
Di...Director Yoon!

54:55.090 --> 54:57.020
- Is this a dream or for real?
- Don't, don't.

54:57.020 --> 54:58.260
What the? Don't.

54:58.260 --> 54:59.620
It's not a dream.

55:00.630 --> 55:01.750
Director Yoon!

55:08.370 --> 55:10.700
Mom's Touch.

55:11.440 --> 55:12.840
Wow, looks good.

55:16.040 --> 55:18.340
- It's too much.
- It's too much.

55:18.870 --> 55:19.950
Thanks for coming.

55:19.950 --> 55:21.450
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

55:21.450 --> 55:22.450
Okay.

55:23.850 --> 55:25.880
I'm going to put it up on the wall.

55:25.880 --> 55:27.050
We're going to disband soon.

55:27.050 --> 55:29.290
So it'll become a rare item.

55:29.660 --> 55:30.920
Bon appetit!

55:30.920 --> 55:33.030
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

55:35.990 --> 55:38.830
- Thanks for the food.
- Thanks for the food.

55:42.570 --> 55:43.670
It's good.

55:46.740 --> 55:47.810
It's so good.

55:48.010 --> 55:49.510
- It's good?
- Yeah.

55:49.510 --> 55:51.110
- It's so crispy.
- It's really good.

55:51.110 --> 55:52.650
It's moist

55:52.650 --> 55:53.680
and crispy.

55:53.680 --> 55:54.580
You're not crying, right?

55:54.580 --> 55:55.580
I...

55:56.650 --> 55:58.550
Should've gone with you.

55:58.550 --> 56:00.750
Then I could've seen that pervert

56:00.750 --> 56:02.760
crumble and fall with my own eyes.

56:02.760 --> 56:03.760
Yeah, right!

56:03.760 --> 56:06.190
You played with Jung-yeon with the most gusto.

56:06.190 --> 56:07.360
See?

56:07.530 --> 56:08.730
My dream was right.

56:08.730 --> 56:10.060
The missing one was Stella.

56:10.060 --> 56:10.800
Come on.

56:10.800 --> 56:12.130
She didn't go missing.

56:12.130 --> 56:15.670
You're too literal.

56:16.600 --> 56:17.700
Sorry.

56:17.700 --> 56:18.340
Because of me...

56:18.340 --> 56:19.540
Knock it off.

56:19.740 --> 56:21.710
You don't apologize for something

56:21.710 --> 56:23.040
you didn't do wrong.

56:23.280 --> 56:24.410
Cotton Candy rule.

56:24.740 --> 56:26.480
From this moment, it's Day 1.

56:28.380 --> 56:29.750
What's with Elle?

56:30.750 --> 56:32.990
- From this moment, it's Day 1.
- From this moment, it's Day 1.

56:47.400 --> 56:48.430
Excuse me...

56:48.970 --> 56:51.840
Sorry for bothering you with a big event ahead.

56:52.400 --> 56:54.140
I'll ask someone else.

56:55.540 --> 56:56.780
I'm sorry.

57:01.780 --> 57:02.780
Hey.

57:05.480 --> 57:07.150
Chae-ah. We're leaving.

57:07.150 --> 57:08.450
To Lia Kim's studio.

57:09.690 --> 57:10.690
Troy.

57:10.790 --> 57:11.720
Huh?

57:12.020 --> 57:13.290
You said

57:14.560 --> 57:15.960
you'll listen to Dan's song.

57:15.960 --> 57:17.130
You said no.

57:17.130 --> 57:18.730
I know you listened to it.

57:19.700 --> 57:21.300
Why won't you say anything?

57:23.540 --> 57:24.600
See?

57:25.800 --> 57:26.970
I was right, huh?

57:28.010 --> 57:29.690
Dan was just being nice?

57:32.180 --> 57:35.080
There's no way I'm irreplaceable in this biz.

57:36.620 --> 57:39.420
There are so many talented people here.

57:39.790 --> 57:43.320
Dan gave up. Why are you bothered?

57:44.690 --> 57:45.760
Well...

57:48.090 --> 57:49.290
I don't know

57:49.800 --> 57:51.200
what I really want.

57:55.030 --> 57:56.330
I guess

57:56.330 --> 57:57.970
I wanted to try it.

57:59.500 --> 58:00.500
Chae-ah.

58:03.460 --> 58:04.540
You're right.

58:05.910 --> 58:08.350
You're not the most talented person.

58:10.250 --> 58:11.320
But...

58:12.480 --> 58:14.020
I listened to the song.

58:15.020 --> 58:16.620
Dan is right.

58:17.390 --> 58:18.760
It has to be you.

58:19.490 --> 58:20.490
The song's yours.

58:20.990 --> 58:22.690
- Huh?
- Your voice

58:22.690 --> 58:26.470
has to be there to complete it.

58:27.100 --> 58:28.100
Hey.

58:28.900 --> 58:30.700
Instead of being the most talented,

58:30.700 --> 58:33.170
isn't it better to be irreplaceable?

58:37.640 --> 58:40.150
Why didn't you say anything earlier?

58:40.150 --> 58:41.980
I'm saying it now.

58:42.310 --> 58:43.820
Since Dan gave up.

58:49.620 --> 58:50.720
Go on.

58:53.760 --> 58:55.330
I'll ask her one more time.

58:56.600 --> 58:58.560
Hey! Park Eun-dan!

59:04.700 --> 59:05.700
Let's do it!

59:06.640 --> 59:07.140
What?

59:07.140 --> 59:08.310
I said let's do it!

59:09.340 --> 59:10.440
No big deal.

59:10.440 --> 59:11.680
I'll do it.

59:13.250 --> 59:16.080
I'm doing it out of my busy schedule.

59:26.460 --> 59:27.590
Fight on!

59:28.030 --> 59:29.690
Fight on! I hope you do well.

59:29.690 --> 59:31.230
Let's do well, Dan.

59:36.740 --> 59:37.840
Ready?

59:38.100 --> 59:39.140
We'll begin.

59:40.910 --> 59:44.910
Three, two, one.

59:49.310 --> 59:53.690
Oh boy I got a secret place that we can go

59:53.690 --> 59:58.420
A place I never invited anyone

59:58.420 --> 1:00:03.060
Leaving a scent only you can know

1:00:03.060 --> 1:00:07.030
I make you yearn for me before you know it

1:00:07.030 --> 1:00:11.500
Maybe I already know that this is dangerous

1:00:11.500 --> 1:00:15.740
My head says no, but I want you more, girl

1:00:15.740 --> 1:00:18.240
You grip my breath

1:00:18.240 --> 1:00:21.050
Make me give up

1:00:21.050 --> 1:00:25.680
Even if everything of me gets burned

1:00:25.680 --> 1:00:30.060
Put everything of yours in my hand

1:00:30.060 --> 1:00:34.090
Put your breath onto my lips

1:00:34.090 --> 1:00:36.260
We dance the same dance

1:00:36.260 --> 1:00:39.300
We sing of each other

1:00:39.300 --> 1:00:41.630
It's okay, it's just for tonight

1:00:41.630 --> 1:00:44.350
We don't say anything tonight

1:01:04.990 --> 1:01:07.190
Try me, What's wrong with me?

1:01:07.190 --> 1:01:09.530
You hate me, I'll show you who I am

1:01:09.530 --> 1:01:12.200
Baby, I gotta live it up

1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:16.230
Try me, What's wrong with me?

1:01:16.230 --> 1:01:18.640
You hate me, Now I've changed

1:01:18.640 --> 1:01:21.570
Baby, I gotta live it up

1:01:23.140 --> 1:01:25.380
Honestly, it's ludicrous

1:01:25.380 --> 1:01:27.680
You scorned me

1:01:27.680 --> 1:01:30.520
But now you only follow me

1:01:30.520 --> 1:01:32.120
Level up, level up

1:01:32.120 --> 1:01:34.420
My patience is running thin

1:01:34.420 --> 1:01:36.720
You must've looked down on me

1:01:36.720 --> 1:01:40.290
Now, take a look at me

1:01:41.490 --> 1:01:43.730
Don't judge me (I know)

1:01:43.730 --> 1:01:46.330
Got no limit

1:01:46.330 --> 1:01:48.600
Every moment of crisis

1:01:48.600 --> 1:01:50.570
I turn it into an opportunity

1:01:50.570 --> 1:01:53.340
I want to do whatever I want

1:01:53.340 --> 1:01:56.980
I can't stop that easily

1:01:56.980 --> 1:01:57.910
As for me

1:01:57.910 --> 1:01:59.680
I gotta live it up

1:02:11.490 --> 1:02:12.820
Great.

1:02:12.820 --> 1:02:13.690
Good job.

1:02:13.690 --> 1:02:14.590
Alright!

1:02:14.860 --> 1:02:16.430
- Good job, Ji-han.
- You, too.

1:02:16.430 --> 1:02:18.140
It's over!

1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:20.300
It's the last song!

1:02:20.300 --> 1:02:22.370
It's finished!

1:02:35.120 --> 1:02:37.420
Mars Video Lyrics Album Production Proposal

1:02:35.410 --> 1:02:36.550
I asked each member

1:02:36.550 --> 1:02:38.020
to pick a meaningful spot

1:02:38.020 --> 1:02:40.490
or a place they'd like to reminisce.

1:02:40.490 --> 1:02:41.920
It's more interesting than I thought.

1:02:41.920 --> 1:02:44.590
Because the places are ordinary and personal,

1:02:44.590 --> 1:02:46.790
the picture will be more diverse.

1:02:46.960 --> 1:02:47.890
Really?

1:02:48.060 --> 1:02:49.730
Why don't you continue to insist

1:02:49.730 --> 1:02:51.160
adding tourist sites?

1:02:51.160 --> 1:02:52.060
Sir?

1:02:55.900 --> 1:02:57.300
He's so petty.

1:02:57.300 --> 1:02:58.570
You realize that now?

1:03:00.040 --> 1:03:01.310
He also has sharp ears.

1:03:01.310 --> 1:03:02.310
Of course!

1:03:02.310 --> 1:03:04.340
I can hear

1:03:04.340 --> 1:03:06.910
a needle drop 244 miles away.

1:03:06.910 --> 1:03:08.210
He's insane!

1:03:10.520 --> 1:03:12.080
A real wacko.

1:03:13.650 --> 1:03:14.720
Yes?

1:03:14.550 --> 1:03:17.560
Ji-han's spot
Oranbi Village

1:03:19.160 --> 1:03:20.260
Wacko, wacko.

1:03:30.900 --> 1:03:31.900
What?

1:03:32.370 --> 1:03:33.670
Oranbi Village.

1:03:33.870 --> 1:03:36.210
I didn't know you remembered it.

1:03:37.510 --> 1:03:38.810
If you're free now, you want to go?

1:03:38.810 --> 1:03:39.880
It's not that far.

1:03:39.880 --> 1:03:40.880
What?

1:03:42.150 --> 1:03:43.850
It's been a long time since I last went.

1:03:44.150 --> 1:03:45.650
Forget it. It's so out of the blue.

1:03:45.650 --> 1:03:47.690
No one will be there now.

1:03:47.920 --> 1:03:48.890
Get up.

1:03:48.890 --> 1:03:50.620
It's because I'm curious.

1:03:50.620 --> 1:03:52.620
I want to know how much it changed.

1:03:52.620 --> 1:03:53.530
No!

1:03:53.530 --> 1:03:54.660
Get up, buster.

1:03:54.660 --> 1:03:55.360
Come on.

1:03:55.360 --> 1:03:56.690
I have a schedule tomorrow.

1:03:56.690 --> 1:03:57.630
I'll clear it.

1:03:57.630 --> 1:03:58.000
- Let's go.
- No.

1:03:58.000 --> 1:03:59.360
I made arrangements with Calla.

1:03:59.360 --> 1:04:00.900
I'm the CEO, okay?

1:04:06.370 --> 1:04:07.870
I must be mad.

1:04:07.870 --> 1:04:09.710
I'm on a rare break,

1:04:09.910 --> 1:04:11.840
but I'm spending it with you.

1:04:12.140 --> 1:04:13.810
You're cute.

1:04:13.810 --> 1:04:14.880
Are you crazy?

1:04:14.880 --> 1:04:15.850
Hey.

1:04:15.850 --> 1:04:17.980
Cool, stylish and sexy.

1:04:17.980 --> 1:04:19.050
You want to be like that, right?

1:04:19.050 --> 1:04:22.220
But to me, you just look plain cute.

1:04:22.220 --> 1:04:23.870
What are you doing?

1:04:24.520 --> 1:04:25.290
Hey.

1:04:25.290 --> 1:04:26.420
Tell me.

1:04:26.420 --> 1:04:28.860
Why is that place your memorable spot?

1:04:29.360 --> 1:04:31.400
There's nowhere else I know in Korea.

1:04:31.400 --> 1:04:33.370
I put it in because it just came to mind.

1:04:33.870 --> 1:04:36.400
My grandparents adored you. You were cute.

1:04:36.400 --> 1:04:38.240
Stop saying I was cute.

1:04:38.240 --> 1:04:40.970
If they were alive, they'd still adore you.

1:04:40.970 --> 1:04:42.740
You cute rascal!

1:04:42.740 --> 1:04:43.780
You're crazy!

1:04:44.140 --> 1:04:45.510
I'm 25 years old now.

1:04:45.510 --> 1:04:47.150
Oh, are you? Good for you.

1:04:47.610 --> 1:04:49.080
Let's get in the car now.

1:04:49.080 --> 1:04:50.820
I'm almost half fifty!

1:05:01.860 --> 1:05:04.360
It's time to use this.

1:05:17.640 --> 1:05:19.240
Special thanks to Son Byung-ho, Oh Yun-Hong
and Oh Jung-yeon for their special appearance

1:05:29.190 --> 1:05:31.590
IDOL
[IDOL: The Coup]

1:05:31.590 --> 1:05:32.790
I'll use this photo and write

1:05:32.790 --> 1:05:34.790
a romance scandal about you two.

1:05:34.790 --> 1:05:35.930
If you want to do that so much,

1:05:35.930 --> 1:05:36.700
go ahead and do it.

1:05:36.700 --> 1:05:38.760
Don't hide behind others like a kid.

1:05:38.760 --> 1:05:39.930
Come here, you bastard!

1:05:39.930 --> 1:05:40.670
Come here!

1:05:40.670 --> 1:05:42.330
To get what you wanted,

1:05:42.330 --> 1:05:44.300
it's true you used Ji-han.

1:05:44.300 --> 1:05:45.300
Since we're the crazy women

1:05:45.300 --> 1:05:46.970
of this area!

1:05:46.970 --> 1:05:47.740
Disband!

1:05:47.740 --> 1:05:49.370
Let's go!

1:05:49.370 --> 1:05:50.310
What?

1:05:50.310 --> 1:05:51.610
Oh Hyun-ji isn't here?

1:05:51.610 --> 1:05:53.080
I think we have to do it by ourselves.

1:05:53.080 --> 1:05:54.710
Hyun-ji won't be coming.

1:05:54.710 --> 1:05:56.650
For the past 3 months, no regrets, right?

1:05:56.650 --> 1:05:57.950
You did all you wanted to do, right?

1:05:57.950 --> 1:05:59.150
Let's disband!
