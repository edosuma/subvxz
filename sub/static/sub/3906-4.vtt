What, you think the military created us?

18:24.040 --> 18:25.530
<i>I don't know. I don't know.</i>

18:25.600 --> 18:28.365
But this, this, this could be key, Sarah.

18:30.120 --> 18:31.201
CAL: Now you turn it around...

18:33.000 --> 18:34.570
I'm going to come back tonight.

18:36.600 --> 18:38.125
Don't you think that's really dangerous?

18:39.200 --> 18:42.204
Mrs S lied straight to my face about Project LEDA.

18:42.520 --> 18:45.330
<i>I need to know where she is,
I need to know what she knows.</i>

18:45.560 --> 18:47.289
She's the key to all of this.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.408
<i>Okay, let me handle this LEDA stuff.</i>

19:01.800 --> 19:05.486
Well, I thought it was a butterfly but an angel will do.

- Thank you.
- Sure.

19:13.400 --> 19:14.561

19:18.440 --> 19:20.681
They put up roadblocks but they're behind us.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.764
There's a BOLO out on my truck.

19:24.440 --> 19:27.046
- A "be on the lookout".
- Yeah, I know what it means.

19:27.560 --> 19:30.006
I don't know why you're doing any of this, Cal.

19:33.040 --> 19:34.929
I need a favour.

19:35.720 --> 19:37.688
I have to go back home to find someone.

19:48.360 --> 19:51.443
- Jesus!
- Hello, Benjamin.

19:52.120 --> 19:53.360
Siobhan, you're okay?

19:53.440 --> 19:54.521
Why wouldn't I be?

19:54.880 --> 19:56.962
I heard that someone did the birdwatchers.

19:58.920 --> 20:02.163
- You!
- It was a trap. It backfired.

20:02.520 --> 20:05.524
I didn't... I had no idea.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.810
If you had, we wouldn't be talking right now.

20:11.560 --> 20:14.040
- What do you want?
- New papers.

20:15.120 --> 20:17.885
I have to get to London to find somebody.

20:17.960 --> 20:20.884
If it's who I think it is, you don't have to go to London.

Carlton's here.

20:44.880 --> 20:47.611
- Felix!
- Oh, my God!

Hi! So this is what
the world looks like sober.

They won't let me out unless somebody takes me.

20:53.800 --> 20:55.450
What do you mean? What about Donnie?

20:55.520 --> 20:56.681
He put me here!

20:56.760 --> 20:58.728
He's my monitor.

20:59.880 --> 21:04.010
- Are you sure?
- Yes, yes, yes, he institutionalised me.

21:04.080 --> 21:09.166
No, darling, I mean that rehab
usually requires some form of consent.

21:10.800 --> 21:12.006
This was my idea?

That's disturbing but sort of the point, love.

You go away for a week, you come
back from the spa, fresh as a daisy,

no one's the wiser, plus no Donnie.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.604
- Okay, one week.
- Brilliant!

Oh, God, or just brunch.

in the camper tonight.

Well, I've never really been a dad before.

22:48.560 --> 22:49.641
Thank you.

22:53.880 --> 22:55.041
Uh, you should...

- Yeah.

- I'll text you a safe number.

23:06.320 --> 23:08.243
- Eh?
- Just give me the name.

23:11.160 --> 23:12.400
Dyad Group.

23:14.680 --> 23:16.842
You must have really gotten under their skin.

23:16.920 --> 23:19.002
They sort of got under mine first.

24:10.360 --> 24:11.441
How'd you find me?

24:11.520 --> 24:12.646
I heard you were in the neighbourhood,

24:12.720 --> 24:15.451
so I looked for the nearest place
to find a pint and a pair of tits.

24:15.520 --> 24:18.410
- I do have my weaknesses.
- Well, let me go

Still a poet.

24:39.440 --> 24:41.727
I wasn't sure I'd ever see you again.

24:41.960 --> 24:44.531
It took me a long time to come to terms with that.

24:45.240 --> 24:48.562
And now that you have seen me again?

24:49.560 --> 24:51.847
I'm not sure this is wise at all.

24:53.240 --> 24:55.402
God, I missed you, woman.

24:56.320 --> 24:59.085
Well, I thought about you once or twice.

25:03.600 --> 25:05.841
What about your friend upstairs?

25:05.920 --> 25:09.402
- We could go ask her to join us.
- (LAUGHING) Careful.

- Don't tell me you've gotten shy.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll explain later.

26:07.120 --> 26:09.248
Anything from Siobhan? Anything?

26:09.800 --> 26:11.404
Nothing from Mumsy, no.

- I'm not on anything.

- No birth control?
- No.

26:54.720 --> 26:56.961
Well, you won't need it in here, anyway,

26:57.040 --> 26:59.646
'cause there's no relations,
especially with other residents.

- Alison!

- you have issues.
- (SCOFFS)

27:46.600 --> 27:49.080
And until you get those sorted out,

27:50.320 --> 27:51.970
I don't think you should be around the children.

27:52.040 --> 27:53.849
That is not your decision to make.

27:53.920 --> 27:57.083
It is if you leave rehab before the programme's finished.

27:57.160 --> 27:59.686
At least, that's what my lawyer says.

28:01.440 --> 28:03.249
Get well, Ali.

28:08.720 --> 28:11.246
So, what exactly do we expect to find down memory lane?

28:11.320 --> 28:14.483
Something about S's network.

28:15.080 --> 28:16.605
Which has got to be somewhere.

32:33.800 --> 32:35.609
What did you find out about the professors?

32:35.680 --> 32:40.049
Okay, Susan and Ethan Duncan, they were geneticists,

32:40.120 --> 32:44.569
both British citizens, um, they went
to Cambridge for molecular biology.

32:45.040 --> 32:49.250
In '74, they joint-published
a paper on recombinant DNA

32:49.320 --> 32:51.891
and there were several more papers
that they published after that,

32:51.960 --> 32:54.042
until the last one in '76.

32:54.520 --> 32:56.204
Is that when they started Project LEDA?

32:56.280 --> 32:58.123
Yeah, well, it makes sense if
they were working on something

32:58.200 --> 32:59.406
totally top secret

32:59.480 --> 33:02.882
because they kind of disappear
until the big lab explosion.

33:03.680 --> 33:05.728
So, they were Rachel's parents, then?

33:06.000 --> 33:07.001
Adoptive parents. I mean,

33:07.080 --> 33:10.687
Amelia carried you for them until she hid you and then...

33:10.760 --> 33:13.286
And then they somehow ended up with Rachel instead.

33:13.360 --> 33:15.727
<i>FELIX: just think, Sarah,
you could have been Rachel.</i>

33:15.800 --> 33:17.802
Well, she's got good taste.

33:21.880 --> 33:23.245
And a boy toy.

33:23.320 --> 33:24.321
<i>FELIX: Oh, really?</i>

33:24.440 --> 33:26.602
Well, at least she's got feelings somewhere in her body.

33:26.680 --> 33:28.762
Yeah, just not in her soul.

33:29.960 --> 33:32.247
You know, she would have been raised
totally self-aware.

33:32.320 --> 33:35.767
(STAMMERING)
And that sense of being the only self-aware clone

33:35.840 --> 33:39.162
might have created a very profound sense of narcissism.

33:39.240 --> 33:42.130
She probably thinks that she's elite.

33:42.200 --> 33:45.090
<i>I feel like the whole thing would have been very clinical,</i>

33:45.160 --> 33:46.764
<i>like every aspect of her life</i>

33:46.840 --> 33:50.162
<i>totally controlled for one singular purpose.</i>

33:50.240 --> 33:52.971
She would have been raised
without any emotional attachments,

33:53.040 --> 33:55.202
so that she could be the perfect,

33:55.280 --> 33:57.442
like, corporate leader, totally able to make decisions

33:57.520 --> 33:59.488
based solely on strategic advantage.

34:00.000 --> 34:03.482
<i>FELIX: $0, Rachel</i> 3 <i>evil because Mummy
and Daddy didn't hug her enough?</i>

34:03.560 --> 34:05.210
<i>I love you, too, Daddy.</i>

34:06.560 --> 34:07.686
I don't think so.

34:07.760 --> 34:09.842
<i>COSIMA: Well, the psychology
makes sense, Sarah.</i>

34:11.639 --> 34:12.880
Shit, I gotta go.

34:21.159 --> 34:23.322
It's me.
Yeah, well, there's been a problem.

34:23.400 --> 34:24.639
Sarah Manning's gone.

34:25.600 --> 34:27.568
I did and now I don't.

34:28.800 --> 34:30.005
There was an accident.

34:31.120 --> 34:32.360
No, she took it with her.

34:33.120 --> 34:34.121
I don't know.

34:35.600 --> 34:37.329
No, Rachel's not back till morning.

34:38.400 --> 34:41.051
No, she has no idea and she's not going to find out.

34:41.960 --> 34:43.928
Leekie, relax!

34:44.000 --> 34:47.163
We'll find Sarah and we'll find out what she knows.

34:48.280 --> 34:49.690
Gently, yes.

34:50.800 --> 34:51.801
Yes.

34:59.240 --> 35:01.129
Well, look who it is.

35:01.200 --> 35:02.486
You can't shoot me, can you?

35:02.560 --> 35:04.961
You're not allowed to. Right?

35:10.640 --> 35:12.290
You're right.

35:31.920 --> 35:33.490
(STRUMMING GUITAR)

35:36.240 --> 35:38.766
My mom's not coming tonight, is she?

35:39.240 --> 35:42.084
She's late, probably not.

35:46.240 --> 35:48.402
Hey, we'll talk to her tomorrow.

35:51.800 --> 35:52.801
Are you sad?

35:54.560 --> 35:58.121
Sad's okay sometimes.
Just don't be worried.

35:58.200 --> 36:01.647
I'm not. She has a guardian angel.

36:12.920 --> 36:13.921
It's cute.

36:17.920 --> 36:19.649
Thought this would be a good place to talk.

36:19.920 --> 36:21.285
Easier to clean up after.

36:25.360 --> 36:27.966
Tell me where you got this and who else knows about it.

36:28.800 --> 36:31.770
Better idea. Eat me.

36:37.320 --> 36:38.321
(SIGHS)

36:38.960 --> 36:41.361
You're not really the smartest clone, are you?

36:41.440 --> 36:44.205
Smart enough to know you're shagging Rachel.

36:44.280 --> 36:48.490
The way you operate, that means you're her monitor, right?

36:49.720 --> 36:52.087
You report to Leekie on her.

36:52.160 --> 36:54.288
I thought it would be somebody higher up.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.525
Somebody who looks like me.

37:00.720 --> 37:03.769
Well, don't flatter yourself.
There's already too many of you.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.001
Daniel...

37:10.040 --> 37:13.840
What are you so scared for us
to find out about Project LEDA?

37:14.960 --> 37:16.325
What makes you think

37:16.400 --> 37:18.926
you're going to be able to tell anyone when we're done?

37:22.520 --> 37:23.601
You wouldn't...

37:25.400 --> 37:27.607
- Daniel... Daniel...
- What?

37:27.680 --> 37:29.603
I look like her, don't I?

37:30.320 --> 37:32.687
I look just like her.

37:33.800 --> 37:35.006
This is happening.

37:36.800 --> 37:38.564
- You wouldn't.
- Leekie wouldn't.

37:39.280 --> 37:42.363
Rachel might. But this, this is for me.

37:42.800 --> 37:44.404
No... No...

37:44.800 --> 37:45.801
Don't fight.

Hello, <i>sestra.</i> Good to see you.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.968
Helena, what you doing here?

39:12.760 --> 39:15.001
I followed you from Mother's house.

39:15.080 --> 39:17.128
I shot you. You were dead.

39:17.320 --> 39:19.402
- You were dead!
- Yes, you did.

39:21.960 --> 39:23.246
It's a miracle.

39:25.320 --> 39:27.687
And we were meant to be together.

39:27.760 --> 39:29.125
Stay away from me!

39:32.320 --> 39:36.723
Please, <i>sestra,</i> I need your help.

It's a promotion, Paul.

Are you asking me if I'm interested
or reminding me I have no choice?

You're safe here.
