15:45.377 --> 15:49.146
And if we don't find
some way to get a grip,
we're gonna become the bad guys.

15:49.213 --> 15:51.715
Well, we've gotta
get that crystal
away from Doomquest.

15:51.782 --> 15:53.283
It's our only hope.

16:00.058 --> 16:03.861
Oh, what a story.
They saved the station.

16:03.929 --> 16:07.998
April O'Neil,
how would you like to cover
the story of the century?

16:08.066 --> 16:11.101
Just give me a van
and stand clear.

16:11.169 --> 16:13.170
Take one
and get on it.

16:14.439 --> 16:16.407
[ Hi-Tech ]
The engines are repaired.

16:16.474 --> 16:19.609
[ Dregg ] Now our quest
for the Vortex Crystal
can begin.

16:20.846 --> 16:23.313
- [ Power Winding Down ]
- What the--

16:23.381 --> 16:27.284
Doomquest must have the entire
<i>Dreggnought</i> under some kind
of electronic restraint.

16:27.352 --> 16:29.720
Then bypass it.

16:29.788 --> 16:32.122
My lord,
I-- I don't know if--

16:32.891 --> 16:34.658
Now, Hi-Tech,

16:34.726 --> 16:38.829
get this ship free,
or I'll blast you to atoms.

16:38.897 --> 16:44.334
Are you saying
that crystal has the power
to stabilize our mutations?

16:44.402 --> 16:47.904
Well, according
to these waveforms, uh, yes.

16:47.972 --> 16:50.540
They almost match the pattern
of the mutagen's instability.

16:50.608 --> 16:54.478
And when Raphael and I were
exposed to the crystal's energy,

16:54.546 --> 16:56.046
we de-mutated.

16:56.113 --> 16:58.048
But can you be sure?

16:58.115 --> 17:00.050
Yeah. Well,
uh, almost sure.

17:00.185 --> 17:02.886
Somehow I'd really prefer
you were sure sure...

17:02.954 --> 17:04.989
before we go risking
our necks for that thing.

17:05.056 --> 17:07.057
Raphael,
it's our only hope.

17:07.125 --> 17:10.994
The next time we mutate,
we might tear each other apart.

17:19.904 --> 17:23.839
Anybody know where
we can get a good deal
on a new set of wheels?

17:23.907 --> 17:26.776
[ Donatello ]
The crystal's gotta
be inside somewhere.

17:26.844 --> 17:28.978
We'll have to search
for it.
[ Raphael ] Terrific.

17:29.046 --> 17:31.148
That'll only take,
what, a couple of years?

17:36.988 --> 17:40.424
If it's not in here,
I don't know where else
it could be.

17:40.492 --> 17:41.725
Dudes, check it out.

17:41.792 --> 17:43.526
The crystal!

17:46.231 --> 17:50.033
I've been expecting you.
[ Donatello ]
It figures.

17:50.101 --> 17:52.770
[ Doomquest ]
If you want
the Vortex Crystal,

17:52.837 --> 17:54.938
you'll have
to get past me.

17:55.006 --> 17:58.108
We'll have to take
this overstuffed
turkey down.

17:58.176 --> 18:02.379
No sweat, dude.
So long as we don't... mutate.

18:02.446 --> 18:06.116
You had to open
your big, fat beak,
didn't you?

18:06.183 --> 18:09.786
Come on. Let's knock
this jumbo jerk for a loop.

18:09.854 --> 18:12.823
Michelangelo,
don't tell me
you're losing it too?

18:12.891 --> 18:16.560
[ Doomquest ]
As your brawn increases,
your brains diminish.

18:16.628 --> 18:21.031
You pathetic worms,
this is almost going
to be too easy.

18:21.098 --> 18:22.766
[ All Yelling ]

18:24.969 --> 18:27.037
I gotta get to that crystal.

18:29.273 --> 18:32.709
You four simpletons
will never get my crystal.

18:32.777 --> 18:34.845
Its work is almost done.

18:34.913 --> 18:38.381
Darkrealm will soon
obliterate this pitiful world.

18:38.449 --> 18:42.118
On my count of three,
we jump that sucker.

18:42.186 --> 18:45.221
I ain't waiting
for your stupid count, dude.

18:50.161 --> 18:51.595
Arrogant insects!

18:51.663 --> 18:54.998
[ Both Yell, Grunt ]

18:55.066 --> 18:57.834
[ Hi-Tech ]
The restraints have
been bypassed, Lord Dregg.

18:57.902 --> 19:02.105
At last,
the time has come.

19:03.908 --> 19:05.943
[ Hi-Tech ]
My lord,
this is a mistake.

19:18.556 --> 19:20.591
My micro-saw
never lets me down.

19:21.993 --> 19:24.595
Oh, nice going,
dipstick.

19:24.662 --> 19:28.331
Why'd you trip me up
like that?
You got in my way, melon head.

19:28.399 --> 19:30.233
[ Chortling ]

19:30.301 --> 19:33.303
You fools would probably
destroy yourselves.

19:33.371 --> 19:35.305
But I'd hate
to miss the fun.

19:35.373 --> 19:38.141
Now to blast you all
out of existence.

19:38.209 --> 19:40.343
- [ Karate Yell ]
- [ Grunts ]

19:43.448 --> 19:46.716
[ All Groaning, Grunting ]

19:46.784 --> 19:48.918
The crystal.
It worked.

19:48.986 --> 19:51.221
It destabilized
our mutations.

19:53.290 --> 19:57.828
All right, Doomquest,
this is the finish.

19:59.731 --> 20:03.500
Destroying you
will be a pleasure.

20:05.069 --> 20:08.071
We're not
letting this thing
out of our sight.

20:13.277 --> 20:15.245
They've got
my crystal!

20:15.313 --> 20:17.347
The crystal is mine!

20:23.888 --> 20:26.356
[ Carter ]
The city's still the same,

20:26.424 --> 20:28.858
and those creatures
are still loose.

20:28.926 --> 20:31.495
Removing the crystal
must have only stopped
the process.

20:31.563 --> 20:33.630
We still have
to reverse it somehow.

20:33.697 --> 20:36.500
Ah, this is gonna take
a minute to figure out.

20:36.567 --> 20:40.237
Uh, guys,
we don't have a minute.

20:40.305 --> 20:41.938
Let's book.

20:49.981 --> 20:51.548
P.U.!

20:51.649 --> 20:53.984
This situation
could not possibly
get any worse.

20:55.720 --> 20:57.855
You had to go and open
your big mouth.

21:04.762 --> 21:07.964
Dudes, we can't let
either of those wackos
get that crystal.

21:08.032 --> 21:12.469
And we need to send
Doomquest and his homeboys back
to the Darkrealm... and fast.

21:12.536 --> 21:15.438
But what about us?
We need the crystal.

21:15.506 --> 21:19.042
There's more at stake
than what happens
to the four of us.

21:19.110 --> 21:21.812
This is your
last chance, deviants.

21:21.879 --> 21:25.281
Turn over the crystal
or be obliterated.

21:25.349 --> 21:28.885
You want it?
You got it!
[ Grunts ]

21:40.498 --> 21:44.868
Noooooooooo!

21:44.935 --> 21:46.236
Whoa.

21:46.271 --> 21:50.006
Well, with that little rock
goes our last chance
at a normal life.

21:51.976 --> 21:55.579
[ Creatures Screeching ]

22:00.284 --> 22:03.887
- Oh, well, everything's
returning to normal.
- You can say that again.

22:06.190 --> 22:10.160
We must go before we, too,
get pulled into the Darkrealm.

22:10.227 --> 22:14.665
But, Lord Dregg--
Take us off this
wretched planet at once.

22:20.371 --> 22:23.707
<i>This reporter has finally</i>
<i>gotten the truth about Dregg.</i>

22:23.774 --> 22:25.809
<i>Listen to his own words.</i>

22:25.877 --> 22:28.011
<i>With this ship</i>
<i>at my command,</i>

22:28.079 --> 22:31.849
-<i> I can finally blast planet</i>
<i>Earth into submission...</i>
- [ Crowd Gasping ]

22:31.916 --> 22:37.020
<i>and you mutants' efforts</i>
<i>to stop me will have</i>
<i>been in vain.</i>

22:37.088 --> 22:39.189
Well, that ought
to give them the message.

22:39.257 --> 22:40.991
Way to go, dudette.

22:41.058 --> 22:44.227
Excuse the heck out of me.
I don't know what you're
all so happy about.

22:44.295 --> 22:46.363
Dregg got away.
We trashed the van.

22:46.431 --> 22:49.699
And without that crystal,
we're still four
over-the-top super mutants.

22:49.767 --> 22:53.203
Raphael, you have to learn
to think positively.

22:54.672 --> 22:57.708
I'm positive
we'll be taking
public transportation.

22:57.775 --> 23:00.610
With this baby,
we'll be rolling again
in no time.

23:00.678 --> 23:03.480
Whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute.
Let me see that.

23:03.548 --> 23:06.249
It looks like
traces of the crystal.

23:06.317 --> 23:09.219
Yeah. Hey, I used it
to remove the crystal.

23:09.287 --> 23:11.288
If we can analyze
these traces,

23:11.355 --> 23:14.390
maybe we can discover
why the crystal
stabilized your mutations.

23:14.458 --> 23:17.727
Now do you believe
in the power of positive
thinking, Raphael?

23:17.795 --> 23:19.262
Oh, yeah. Sure.

23:19.264 --> 23:23.834
I say we positively,
absolutely need
to hail a cab.
