WEBVTT

03:41.958 --> 03:43.667
Did you hear that?

03:51.426 --> 03:52.634
Come on.

04:00.101 --> 04:01.685
Freeze, this is the police.

04:01.769 --> 04:03.770
Drop your weapons
and place your hands above your heads.

04:34.928 --> 04:36.053
And in the local news,

04:36.137 --> 04:39.264
six youth gang members were killed
in a shoot-out last night

04:39.349 --> 04:41.683
with police in South Los Angeles.

04:41.768 --> 04:45.103
Police Commissioner Davidson called
a news conference earlier this morning

04:45.188 --> 04:46.980
to comment on the shooting.

04:47.065 --> 04:49.232
As Police Commissioner
of Los Angeles County,

04:49.317 --> 04:53.737
I have called this emergency
news conference. We have a crisis.

04:53.821 --> 04:57.240
The juvenile gang problem
is completely out of control.

04:57.325 --> 05:00.452
The missing automatic weapons
have not been recovered.

05:00.536 --> 05:02.037
We now have a lead which shows

05:02.121 --> 05:05.582
that some of the weapons
have fallen into the wrong hands.

05:05.667 --> 05:09.586
It's true that law enforcement
is being driven to deplorable extremes,

05:09.671 --> 05:13.382
but those guns are out there.
And believe me,

05:13.466 --> 05:17.970
if the people who have them get organized,
no one will stand a chance.

05:18.054 --> 05:19.388
Commissioner Davidson also said

05:19.472 --> 05:20.722
that several weapons have been...

05:41.786 --> 05:43.203
For the six.

07:37.443 --> 07:41.780
One-W-90, this is Lieutenant Bishop in
unmarked vehicle, requesting assignment.

07:41.864 --> 07:43.698
Is Staff Seven there?

07:45.118 --> 07:46.368
Stand by.

07:48.871 --> 07:51.206
One-W-20, this is Staff Four.

07:51.290 --> 07:54.584
If I look around real hard,
maybe I can find something for you to do.

07:54.669 --> 07:59.714
Hey, hey, Captain Collins. Hello there.
I'm surprised to hear your voice, sir.

08:01.217 --> 08:05.137
W-20, so, how's it going
so far, Lieutenant?

08:05.221 --> 08:10.976
One-W-90, okay. Seeing as
I've been on the job exactly four minutes.

08:11.060 --> 08:14.229
W-20, I've got a temporary reassignment
for you tonight.

08:14.313 --> 08:17.732
A little supervisory job
for the Police Department.

08:17.817 --> 08:22.237
Proceed to Precinct Nine, Division 13,
and take over from Captain Gordon.

08:24.031 --> 08:27.409
- Isn't that the Anderson Precinct?
- Affirmative.

08:29.328 --> 08:30.912
But they're closing it down.

08:30.997 --> 08:35.000
Nothing for me to do there,
except stare at the packing crates.

08:35.083 --> 08:38.336
You wanna be a hero your first
night out, Lieutenant?

08:38.421 --> 08:40.380
Yes, sir.

08:40.464 --> 08:42.090
There are no heroes
anymore, Bishop,

08:42.174 --> 08:45.343
only men who follow orders.

08:45.428 --> 08:50.015
W-90, yes, sir.
Proceeding to Precinct Nine, Division 13.

08:50.099 --> 08:52.434
KMA-492 off.

09:16.751 --> 09:17.959
Starker?

09:23.799 --> 09:25.008
This way.

09:26.177 --> 09:30.305
- Well, they sure gave you some sweet job.
- Better than some.

09:30.389 --> 09:34.517
Carrying a busload of hate
is not my idea of better than anything.

09:42.944 --> 09:45.695
This is Wells and Caudell.

09:45.780 --> 09:48.823
- Is he all right?
- He's just got a little cold.

09:50.326 --> 09:53.453
- Where's Wilson?
- We got him in a special room.

10:02.672 --> 10:04.631
This is Napoleon Wilson.

10:05.925 --> 10:08.718
- Got a smoke?
- Close the door.

10:12.723 --> 10:16.434
I want you to know something, Wilson.

10:16.519 --> 10:20.522
Now, I don't enjoy driving
anybody to death row.

10:20.606 --> 10:23.566
You try anything, anything,

10:23.651 --> 10:28.280
I've got two guards with shotguns
and they'll blow you apart.

10:28.364 --> 10:33.285
- Sure could use a smoke.
- You understand me, Wilson?

10:33.369 --> 10:37.872
You mumble a little bit,
but I get the general idea.

10:39.375 --> 10:40.667
Let's go.

10:54.140 --> 10:56.433
Slipped right out of the chair.

11:00.855 --> 11:04.566
Yeah. I don't sit in chairs
as well as I used to.

11:06.736 --> 11:09.279
- Get him up.
- Come on, let's go.

11:33.929 --> 11:37.932
I'm all jealous of you, Wilson.
You get all this VIP treatment.

11:38.017 --> 11:40.268
Here they let me walk around almost free.

11:40.353 --> 11:42.187
- Hey.
- What?

11:42.271 --> 11:44.689
- You got a smoke on you?
- Yeah.

11:44.774 --> 11:47.567
- But I'm not gonna give it to you.
- Why not?

11:47.651 --> 11:53.281
- Not good for you. Smoking can kill you.
- You don't like competition, huh?

11:53.783 --> 11:58.620
- You think you're real fancy, don't you?
- I have moments.

11:58.704 --> 12:01.915
All right, knock off the talking.
Let's move. Move.

12:10.966 --> 12:14.302
Okay if I stretch a minute?

12:14.303 --> 12:16.763
You're gonna chain me to a seat
and drive for hours.

12:16.847 --> 12:19.349
We get to Sonora,
you're gonna chain me in a cell.

12:19.433 --> 12:25.522
Maybe for as long as 90 years.
Chains is all I got to look forward to.

12:25.606 --> 12:26.856
Go ahead.

12:32.822 --> 12:35.407
You know, Wilson, I'm gonna miss you.

12:39.328 --> 12:41.496
That's not the truth, Warden.

12:45.334 --> 12:48.086
Now, you should always tell the truth.

12:48.170 --> 12:51.339
Even a little white lie
can sometimes trip a man up.

13:00.850 --> 13:03.560
He don't stand up as good as he used to.

13:21.370 --> 13:24.247
...but the sun-spotting caused an unusually...

13:24.331 --> 13:26.583
...with the early morning
shooting of six youths,

13:26.667 --> 13:28.042
now known to be members of

13:28.127 --> 13:31.296
a South Los Angeles gang
known as Street Thunder.

13:31.380 --> 13:35.508
Davidson also commented on
the highly unusual interracial mixture

13:35.593 --> 13:38.094
of the gang victims, and pointed...

13:51.567 --> 13:55.153
All right, let's go over this again.
Now, what are you gonna tell Margaret?

13:55.237 --> 13:58.531
- I forget.
- You're gonna say, "Margaret,

13:58.616 --> 14:01.326
"I want you to come up and live with us
now that Fred is gone."

14:01.410 --> 14:04.996
I want you to come and live with us,
now that Fred is dead.

14:05.080 --> 14:06.831
- Gone.
- Gone.

14:07.958 --> 14:11.085
"We have a big spare room
all ready for you."

14:11.170 --> 14:13.755
We have a big spare room all ready for you.

14:13.839 --> 14:18.468
"And I told my daddy,
if you don't come up and live with us,

14:19.345 --> 14:23.181
- "then I'm gonna run away from home."
- She'll never buy that.

14:25.017 --> 14:26.476
Okay, drop that one.

14:26.560 --> 14:28.311
- Daddy?
- Yeah?

14:28.395 --> 14:30.605
I'm hungry.

14:30.689 --> 14:35.693
You'd rather eat than get your nanny
out of this horrible neighborhood.

14:35.778 --> 14:39.948
Well, I'd know what to say to her better
if I had something to eat.

14:40.032 --> 14:43.826
Where is that street?
I can never seem to find that street.

14:48.832 --> 14:50.708
Why don't we ask them?

14:51.919 --> 14:57.131
Bonaire Place. I think it's down here,
just a couple of blocks more.

14:57.216 --> 15:00.385
Mrs. Seward says a policeman's
always there to answer questions

15:00.469 --> 15:02.971
and to help you when you're in trouble.

15:03.055 --> 15:07.892
Obviously, Mrs. Seward has never taken
any big steps outside of the sixth grade.

15:08.686 --> 15:09.811
Huh?

15:11.146 --> 15:13.481
We're not in any trouble, honey.

18:26.049 --> 18:28.718
- Yeah?
- Hello, I'm Lieutenant Bishop.

18:30.804 --> 18:35.641
Yes, sir.
One moment. I'll tell the Captain you're here.

18:56.038 --> 18:58.331
- Hello, Lieutenant.
- Hi.

18:58.415 --> 19:01.125
- I'm Leigh.
- Ethan Bishop.

19:01.210 --> 19:02.710
This is Julie.

19:04.171 --> 19:06.172
- Hello, Julie.
- Hello.

19:07.716 --> 19:09.801
- Things are quiet.
- For a change.

19:09.885 --> 19:13.888
- You took over at the right time.
- Apparently.

19:13.972 --> 19:15.598
When are you moving?

19:15.682 --> 19:19.018
They shut off the phones and the electricity
at 10:00 tomorrow morning.

19:19.102 --> 19:22.480
- That sounds pretty final.
- Would you like some coffee, Lieutenant?

19:22.564 --> 19:25.066
- Yes, thank you.
- Just made some fresh. I'll get you a cup.

19:25.150 --> 19:26.359
Thanks.

19:29.321 --> 19:31.072
Hello, 7814.

19:33.242 --> 19:35.576
No, I'm sorry,
the precinct has been relocated.

19:35.661 --> 19:41.499
Let me give you the new number. 734-3612.

19:42.835 --> 19:44.418
You're welcome.

19:44.503 --> 19:49.090
The phone company should be doing this.
They're supposed to cut in at 5:00.

19:51.468 --> 19:55.471
Hello. May I speak to Supervisor 12, please?

19:55.556 --> 19:58.766
Yes, hello. This is 734-374...

20:08.944 --> 20:12.405
- Black?
- For over 30 years.

20:14.032 --> 20:17.952
I'm sorry. Two sugars.

20:23.208 --> 20:25.793
I grew up four blocks from here.

20:29.298 --> 20:33.676
When I was about four or five, my father
sent me in here one day with a note.

20:33.760 --> 20:38.514
Detective read it and said,
"We lock up little boys who can't behave."

20:38.599 --> 20:39.765
When he went to call my father,

20:39.850 --> 20:43.936
I carved something on the top of his desk
with a letter opener.

20:44.021 --> 20:48.566
For months, I was afraid he might see it
and come after me.

20:48.650 --> 20:50.818
Why did your father send you in here?

20:50.903 --> 20:54.488
For using foul language
in the presence of my mother.

20:56.825 --> 20:59.118
What did you carve on the desk?

21:04.333 --> 21:06.584
Kind of advanced for a little kid.

21:09.379 --> 21:13.507
Your father or somebody obviously
got you out of Anderson early enough.

21:18.680 --> 21:21.515
The Captain would like
to see you now, Lieutenant.

21:21.600 --> 21:23.476
Be right there.

21:25.354 --> 21:28.230
By the way,

21:28.315 --> 21:31.943
no one took me out of Anderson
when I was a baby.

21:32.027 --> 21:35.529
I walked out, myself, when I was 20.

21:35.614 --> 21:41.077
- Enjoy your new police station.
- I will. Thanks for the coffee.

21:44.373 --> 21:48.125
Well, are they out?
Then get them out!

21:48.210 --> 21:51.420
Double your patrols.
Go ahead. Send them up there.

21:51.505 --> 21:55.383
Don't call over here every time
another division stubs its toe.

21:58.261 --> 22:02.473
What a night.
We've had a 3-12 every 15 minutes.

22:02.557 --> 22:06.852
Twelve stolen cars, three burglaries,
eight aggravated assaults.

22:06.937 --> 22:08.854
And it's not even 8:00.

22:19.408 --> 22:21.242
Could be the sunspots.

22:23.412 --> 22:25.538
Pressure on the atmosphere.

22:27.124 --> 22:29.083
I heard it on the radio.

22:31.753 --> 22:36.632
It's 7:00. I'm going over
to the new station on Ellendale.

22:36.717 --> 22:41.595
You take over here
till Weaver comes in at 4:00.

22:41.680 --> 22:46.767
All you do is answer the telephone
and send over any strays.

22:46.852 --> 22:50.563
There may be some who still think
this is a police station.

22:58.363 --> 23:04.452
- Are there any facilities left over here?
- A couple of cells and a bathroom.

23:04.536 --> 23:07.496
I don't understand
why this place is still open.

23:07.581 --> 23:12.918
Well, it is and it isn't, Lieutenant.
The result of transition.

23:13.003 --> 23:15.212
I really think someone in the central office

23:15.297 --> 23:19.091
wanted to give you
something special on your first night out.

23:22.345 --> 23:24.388
That sure got around fast.

25:57.667 --> 26:00.711
I'm going to talk to Wilson. Watch me.

26:11.932 --> 26:14.475
You don't mind if I sit down
a minute or two, do you, Wilson?

26:14.559 --> 26:17.853
- Got a smoke on you?
- You asked me before.

26:17.938 --> 26:22.191
- Well, I never got a definite answer.
- I don't smoke.

26:22.275 --> 26:24.276
That's a definite answer.

26:26.029 --> 26:27.696
Another one gone.

26:29.407 --> 26:32.493
When you're in my position,
days are like women.

26:33.995 --> 26:39.333
Each one is so goddamn precious.
They always end up leaving you.

26:41.044 --> 26:42.753
What do you want?

26:42.837 --> 26:47.174
- Why? Do I have to want something?
- You're a cop.

26:47.259 --> 26:51.011
You're either curious about me,
or you wanna give me some shit.

26:51.096 --> 26:55.641
- I don't understand you, Wilson.
- Curious.

26:57.519 --> 27:02.439
- You're not a psychopath. You're not stupid.
- I am an asshole.

27:03.400 --> 27:08.904
- Can't take everything away from me.
- Why did you kill those men?

27:14.244 --> 27:16.704
Everybody asks me the same question.

27:18.373 --> 27:20.874
I always tell them the same thing.

27:23.545 --> 27:25.337
First time I ever saw a preacher,

27:25.422 --> 27:30.342
he said to me,
"Son, there's something strange about you.

27:30.427 --> 27:36.056
"You got something to do with death."
Being real young, I believed him.

27:37.392 --> 27:41.770
- Turned out he was right.
- That's no answer.

27:43.565 --> 27:49.486
- I thought it was pretty good.
- Where'd you get a name like Napoleon?

27:49.571 --> 27:52.239
- I'll tell you sometime.
- When?

27:53.700 --> 27:55.284
Moment of dying.

27:56.745 --> 28:00.164
I'm gonna do my best to be there
when your time comes.

28:06.087 --> 28:07.171
Hey.

28:08.715 --> 28:10.341
He's really sick.

28:18.808 --> 28:22.144
I thought the warden said it was only a cold.

28:22.228 --> 28:24.104
The man is sick.

28:32.614 --> 28:37.701
- How long till we get to Sonora?
- Another six hours.

28:37.786 --> 28:39.453
We gotta stop.

28:41.539 --> 28:43.707
What's the closest precinct?

28:47.087 --> 28:48.337
Anderson.

29:31.005 --> 29:35.717
- Descanso to Pinehurst.
- Daddy?

29:35.802 --> 29:37.761
- To Glen Oaks?
- Daddy?

29:37.846 --> 29:41.140
- Daddy, the ice-cream man.
- Wait a second, Margaret.

30:06.708 --> 30:11.086
Here you go. Okay, by your place?

30:14.674 --> 30:18.719
Descanso to Pine...
I mean, Descanso to Glen Oaks, right?

30:20.096 --> 30:21.722
Right. Then I...

30:30.899 --> 30:32.774
Can I get an ice cream?

30:33.860 --> 30:38.155
- It's late, sweetheart. I'm closed.
- The music's still playing.

30:50.293 --> 30:52.711
Please, can't I get an ice cream?

30:54.547 --> 30:56.673
- What flavor?
- Vanilla twist.

31:17.403 --> 31:19.488
Oh, Jesus. Come on.

31:19.572 --> 31:23.700
Come on, I'll give you my money.
Just don't hurt me, please. Please.

31:44.806 --> 31:47.933
Hey, this is regular vanilla.

31:54.607 --> 31:56.483
I wanted vanilla twist.

32:11.958 --> 32:15.794
Okay, Margaret, I'll see you
in a few minutes. Right, bye.

32:54.751 --> 32:59.463
Gun. In the truck, under the dash.

34:36.476 --> 34:39.603
- Hello.
- Hello, Lieutenant, Special Officer Starker.

34:39.688 --> 34:41.231
Ethan Bishop.

34:41.315 --> 34:43.692
I'm on my way to Sonora
with three prisoners.

34:43.775 --> 34:46.235
About half an hour ago
one of them got pretty sick.

34:46.320 --> 34:48.237
- I think it's serious.
- What is it?

34:48.322 --> 34:52.242
Well, I don't know, but I'd like to put him in
your holding tanks until I can call a doctor.

34:52.326 --> 34:54.828
I guess you didn't see the sign.

34:54.911 --> 34:57.914
Well, the station isn't here anymore.
It's being relocated.

34:57.999 --> 34:59.249
Well, yeah, but you're here.

34:59.333 --> 35:01.168
Waiting for the electricity
to go off in the morning.

35:01.252 --> 35:05.172
Are you telling me that
I can't put them in your holding tanks?

35:05.715 --> 35:09.176
If you just get back on the main boulevard,
go about 10 blocks...

35:09.260 --> 35:11.803
Look, I don't have a lot of time to discuss it.

35:11.888 --> 35:16.391
Now, if what that man has in the bus
is infectious, then all of us will have it.

35:16.476 --> 35:18.602
Now, the sooner we can put him
in the holding tanks

35:18.686 --> 35:20.479
and I get on the phone and call a doctor...

35:20.563 --> 35:23.064
- Okay. Bring him in.
- All right.

36:20.248 --> 36:24.918
- Isn’t that overdoing it a little?
- Napoleon Wilson.

36:26.337 --> 36:27.712
No kidding.

36:36.097 --> 36:40.433
- Got a smoke?
- No. Sorry.

36:43.938 --> 36:48.692
Well, you see one floating around,
snag it for me, will you?

37:03.291 --> 37:06.626
- May be a sick man back there.
- Just passing through.

37:27.773 --> 37:32.694
I have to admit it, Wilson.
You do have some fancy moves.

37:32.778 --> 37:34.654
For a man in leg irons.

40:20.321 --> 40:23.865
Come on, man, pull yourself together.
Come on, speak up.

40:25.326 --> 40:26.576
Speak up.

40:29.830 --> 40:31.206
Lieutenant?

40:34.168 --> 40:36.044
- Who?
- Wait a minute.

40:36.128 --> 40:42.092
- Lot of action for a closed-down station.
- Ease up a little, Chaney. He can't talk.

40:42.176 --> 40:44.844
He says there's somebody following him.

40:46.680 --> 40:47.889
Who...

40:48.307 --> 40:52.185
Come on. Look, operator,
I have been waiting 10 minutes.

40:53.854 --> 40:56.940
What do you mean?
Where's he gone to?

40:57.024 --> 40:59.317
- He's gone on a coffee break.
- What's your name?

40:59.401 --> 41:01.319
What do you mean
he's not available?

41:01.403 --> 41:03.113
Who's after you?

41:03.197 --> 41:04.739
Who's after you?

41:04.824 --> 41:09.035
Where is he? Coffee break?
Get him off the coffee break.

41:10.287 --> 41:14.415
Yes, I'll continue holding. Police doctors.

41:16.836 --> 41:18.378
- Just relax.
- Just a minute. Let's calm down...

41:18.462 --> 41:21.172
- There's nobody out there.
- Let's try to...

41:21.257 --> 41:22.298
You're safe now.

41:22.383 --> 41:24.259
Chaney, help me take him
to the Captain's office.

41:24.343 --> 41:25.718
- Take it easy.
- Come on.

41:25.803 --> 41:28.555
Hello? I just got cut off.

41:31.016 --> 41:32.100
Do we have a blanket somewhere?

41:32.184 --> 41:33.476
- Yeah.
- Okay, wrap him up.

41:33.561 --> 41:35.061
- Make sure he stays warm.
- Right.

41:35.146 --> 41:37.105
- I'll call the doctor.
- Good luck.

41:37.189 --> 41:42.235
I mean, first I got put on hold, then I got
cut off, and now I can't even get a dial tone.

41:45.030 --> 41:46.239
They didn't cut you off.

41:46.323 --> 41:48.491
- What are you talking about?
- The phone's dead.

41:48.576 --> 41:51.828
Maybe the company shut it off early.

41:51.912 --> 41:54.455
That's it. I'm leaving.

41:54.540 --> 41:57.834
Lieutenant, you run this station
like chicken night in Turkey.

41:57.918 --> 41:59.419
Thanks a lot!

42:05.134 --> 42:08.178
He was mumbling,
something about his daughter being shot.

42:08.262 --> 42:11.890
- Where?
- I don't know. He still can hardly talk.

42:11.974 --> 42:13.766
What about the phone?

42:23.194 --> 42:25.945
- Now what?
- Power failure?

42:26.030 --> 42:28.281
The streetlights are still on.

42:34.580 --> 42:37.582
I'll call Ellendale on the two-way in my car.

42:48.469 --> 42:50.929
Chaney just fell down.

43:18.082 --> 43:22.585
- He didn't fall. He was shot.
- What?

43:22.670 --> 43:24.587
Couldn't tell if he was still alive.

43:24.672 --> 43:29.008
- But there wasn't any sound.
- Silencers. They're using silencers.

43:35.849 --> 43:37.600
They're in those trees over there.

43:37.685 --> 43:40.561
Why would anybody shoot
at a police station?

43:48.195 --> 43:51.990
Starker! Lock the doors!
Stay down, away from the windows!

43:57.871 --> 44:00.123
Phone breaks down,
the lights go off.

44:00.207 --> 44:03.710
With the highway patrol running this place,
it's amateur night in Dixie.

44:15.556 --> 44:19.183
Open the door! Let me in!

44:24.231 --> 44:25.440
Get up!

44:57.931 --> 45:03.227
You're not gonna let us sit in here.
At least take these cuffs off.

45:03.312 --> 45:04.687
Hey! Hey!

47:33.170 --> 47:34.879
- Leigh?
- Yeah?

47:41.845 --> 47:44.263
I want you to stay at the window.

47:49.353 --> 47:51.103
I'll be right back.

47:55.400 --> 47:58.569
- You both all right?
- Fabulous, as usual.

47:58.654 --> 48:02.114
What's happening out there?

48:10.457 --> 48:15.962
Hey. Come on! We got a right
to know what's happening. Hey!

48:17.714 --> 48:22.760
Left out again.
Life just seems to pass us by, doesn't it?

48:31.353 --> 48:35.940
- I think they're gone. I can't see anything.
- Is there a back way out?

48:36.024 --> 48:38.401
Past the holding tanks,
there's a door at the rear.

48:38.485 --> 48:42.655
- We're blocked off back there.
- How come?

48:42.739 --> 48:45.408
There's a big wall
with a barbed wire fence around it.

48:45.492 --> 48:48.953
The only way out from the back
is to come around front.

48:50.289 --> 48:51.747
Come with me.

49:06.930 --> 49:10.182
- What about the houses behind the wall?
- Empty.

49:10.267 --> 49:12.727
All the houses in back are condemned
and boarded up.

49:12.811 --> 49:14.854
No one lives nearby anymore?

49:14.938 --> 49:17.857
There are two houses
at the end of the block.

49:19.026 --> 49:23.362
- How far are they from the station?
- 500, 600 yards.

49:39.630 --> 49:43.215
- That means no one nearby heard anything.
- That's impossible!

49:44.801 --> 49:49.972
They're using silencers. No gun shots.
The only sounds are the windows breaking.

49:50.057 --> 49:52.558
Well, somebody could've heard that.

49:54.603 --> 49:58.356
I really think they're gone.
I mean, take a look.

50:09.534 --> 50:12.912
- I found a box of magnesium flares.
- No flare gun.

50:12.996 --> 50:17.208
Figures. Try to get that open.

50:22.673 --> 50:24.173
Nothing.

50:24.257 --> 50:27.176
- Not a goddamn thing moving anywhere.
- See?

50:27.260 --> 50:31.138
If you'll just look outside,
you'll see they're gone.

50:31.223 --> 50:33.349
Look, I can't get this open.

50:45.570 --> 50:46.654
Damn thing's solid.

50:46.738 --> 50:49.949
What are you doing with that thing?
We should be figuring a way to get out of...

50:50.033 --> 50:51.992
You got any suggestions?

50:58.625 --> 51:02.837
We're gonna stay here and hold
until somebody comes. Okay?

51:02.921 --> 51:06.424
We're in the middle of a city,
inside a police station.

51:07.801 --> 51:10.970
Someone is bound to drive by eventually.

51:12.889 --> 51:15.725
It may take 15, 20 minutes. They'll come.

51:26.319 --> 51:31.991
It doesn't look like they cut our phone lines.
They're still connected to the pole.

51:32.075 --> 51:35.161
I'll bet they took out
a whole pole down the block.

51:35.245 --> 51:37.913
What does that mean?

51:37.998 --> 51:43.461
If phone lines are down in the area,
no one nearby can call in.

51:43.545 --> 51:45.755
But doesn't the phone company
automatically know

51:45.839 --> 51:50.926
- where there's a line down?
- Wait a minute. There they are.

52:36.348 --> 52:40.768
- They've set up a road block.
- Someone's coming!

53:40.620 --> 53:42.413
What does that mean?

53:47.460 --> 53:51.046
I think
we've just been marked for something.

53:51.131 --> 53:57.928
- Let me guess what it is.
- This is a siege. It's a goddamn siege.

54:05.729 --> 54:07.646
He's the one they want.

54:10.025 --> 54:12.276
Why don't we give him to them?

54:15.238 --> 54:17.990
Well, don't give me that civilized look.

54:20.327 --> 54:24.663
This is my station tonight.
He came in here for help.

54:24.748 --> 54:27.708
He's gonna get all the help we can give him.

54:30.754 --> 54:34.798
- Very nice, Lieutenant.
- Thank you.

54:37.052 --> 54:38.052
No!

54:42.349 --> 54:44.516
Get them out of the cells.

55:05.205 --> 55:08.832
Come on, baby. Hurry it up.

55:13.880 --> 55:19.051
Okay. Get out front. Quick. Move!

55:33.441 --> 55:34.441
Hide!

56:11.688 --> 56:16.233
Give me a gun!
They're coming down the hall.

56:18.653 --> 56:22.114
- I can't hold it.
- Shit!

56:58.318 --> 56:59.735
The windows!

57:11.664 --> 57:13.332
Watch the front.

59:41.481 --> 59:42.648
Julie?

01:00:53.219 --> 01:00:55.637
Wilson?

01:00:55.722 --> 01:00:58.932
We gotta barricade that door.
Give me a hand.

01:00:59.017 --> 01:01:02.060
Wells, you watch the front
and the two offices.

01:01:57.784 --> 01:01:59.951
You saved my life. Twice now.

01:02:01.621 --> 01:02:02.871
Twice?

01:02:02.955 --> 01:02:05.665
First time outside by the bus.

01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:09.544
I figured that was a mistake on your part,
so I let it go.

01:02:09.629 --> 01:02:14.549
Then you did it again
when you pulled us out of the cells.

01:02:14.634 --> 01:02:17.469
You must be serious
about keeping me alive.

01:02:19.138 --> 01:02:21.014
I want all of us alive.

01:02:23.976 --> 01:02:29.481
This time I know somebody heard us.
There'll be squad cars here in five minutes.

01:02:47.917 --> 01:02:49.251
Acetylene.

01:02:51.337 --> 01:02:55.257
- If a stray bullet had hit this...
- Come look at this.

01:03:05.852 --> 01:03:07.769
How is it?

01:03:07.854 --> 01:03:11.148
I can't move it,
and it hurts like a son of a bitch.

01:03:17.697 --> 01:03:20.866
That was close timing in there.
You were good.

01:03:23.953 --> 01:03:27.539
If I'd been any good in here,
maybe she'd still be alive.

01:03:40.052 --> 01:03:41.803
They moved the cars.

01:03:43.473 --> 01:03:47.809
Can't believe it.
They parked them where they were before.

01:03:47.894 --> 01:03:52.022
- Why'd they do that?
- From a distance, the street looks normal.

01:03:52.106 --> 01:03:57.194
- Like nothing happened.
- Like nothing happened?

01:03:57.278 --> 01:04:01.490
They gunned down five police
officers, a secretary, one prisoner!

01:04:01.574 --> 01:04:05.160
We killed a dozen of them,
and that's "nothing happened"?

01:04:06.746 --> 01:04:08.580
Where are the bodies?

01:04:22.386 --> 01:04:24.262
They took them away.

01:04:30.895 --> 01:04:35.357
- How'd they do it so fast?
- Maybe they got the good fairy to help them.

01:04:35.441 --> 01:04:37.734
You really are a smart ass.

01:04:42.949 --> 01:04:47.953
- Prison bus is gone and so are the bodies.
- They dragged old Starker away.

01:04:49.747 --> 01:04:54.793
Too bad. I promised to tell him something.

01:04:54.877 --> 01:04:58.922
What's going on?
What are they doing out there?

01:04:59.006 --> 01:05:03.635
They're hiding every single sign that
there's been an attack on this building.

01:05:03.719 --> 01:05:07.305
What I wanna know is
what started all of this?

01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:12.727
He came running in here,

01:05:12.812 --> 01:05:18.942
- Jesus Christ, 30 minutes ago!
- Now, all of this about one man?

01:05:19.026 --> 01:05:23.822
Don't forget the Cholo.
They delivered it to us.

01:05:26.993 --> 01:05:30.120
You look like somebody spit in your socks.

01:05:30.204 --> 01:05:33.540
No one said anything about the Cholo.

01:05:33.624 --> 01:05:38.044
All right, all right. What does it mean?
What does it mean?

01:05:38.129 --> 01:05:40.171
It means they don't care.

01:05:43.509 --> 01:05:45.969
They're not afraid to die. Any of them.

01:05:46.053 --> 01:05:50.015
They want to rip us apart,
no matter what it costs.

01:05:51.183 --> 01:05:56.896
- It means to the death.
- How do you know so much about it?

01:05:56.981 --> 01:06:01.318
I spent some time in a cell with one of them
crazy young bastards once.

01:06:02.737 --> 01:06:07.324
This can't happen.
Not in the middle of a city.

01:06:08.451 --> 01:06:12.370
- Not today.
- Then let's pinch each other and wake up.

01:06:12.455 --> 01:06:18.293
There was gun fire for a minute and a half,
two minutes.

01:06:18.377 --> 01:06:23.965
- I can't believe no one heard us.
- Maybe they heard it. What do they see?

01:06:24.050 --> 01:06:27.344
An empty street? An empty police station?

01:06:27.428 --> 01:06:30.639
Maybe somebody from
the new precinct will come by.

01:06:30.723 --> 01:06:36.561
In the meantime, I've got this plan.
Now, it's called save ass.

01:06:37.647 --> 01:06:38.647
Now, the way it works is this.

01:06:38.731 --> 01:06:42.275
I slip out of one of these windows,
and I run like a bastard.

01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:43.568
Wells.

01:06:45.988 --> 01:06:51.159
- You know I can't let you do that.
- I'm not asking you to let me.

01:06:51.243 --> 01:06:53.161
They'll cut you down before you get 10 feet.

01:06:53.245 --> 01:06:58.792
- Are you on his side, Wilson?
- No sides to it. We're all together.

01:07:03.130 --> 01:07:05.256
I've been shot once tonight.

01:07:06.884 --> 01:07:09.219
I don't feel like a second time.

01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:18.019
I just wanted to say one thing to you
before you jump out that window.

01:07:18.104 --> 01:07:19.229
When they drag you off,

01:07:19.313 --> 01:07:22.774
I'll lean out and ask them
if they wouldn't mind saying a little prayer

01:07:22.858 --> 01:07:26.820
as they dump you in some vacant lot
next to the five other police officers

01:07:26.904 --> 01:07:29.239
and your sick, handcuffed friend.

01:07:37.623 --> 01:07:40.959
I go through all that
and his gun isn't even loaded.

01:07:50.511 --> 01:07:55.056
Goddamn silencer.
I've been clicking off empty shots all night,

01:07:55.141 --> 01:07:57.058
and I didn't even know it.

01:08:02.273 --> 01:08:06.443
Very close timing. You are good.

01:08:08.279 --> 01:08:09.612
Sometimes.

01:08:12.074 --> 01:08:14.159
Problem is he's not alone.

01:08:16.036 --> 01:08:18.787
This goddamn thing's
got three shots left in it.

01:08:18.872 --> 01:08:21.332
- Wilson?
- Three rounds.

01:08:21.417 --> 01:08:24.002
- Leigh.
- Two shots.

01:08:24.086 --> 01:08:28.339
If there's any spare ammunition
around here, I don't know where it is.

01:08:38.684 --> 01:08:40.477
Anybody got a smoke?

01:08:52.698 --> 01:08:54.115
Got a light?

01:09:25.189 --> 01:09:27.649
One-X-Five, we have
a series of reports

01:09:27.733 --> 01:09:29.692
of firecrackers and/or gunfire

01:09:29.777 --> 01:09:31.277
between Ninth and Warren.

01:09:31.362 --> 01:09:36.658
The telephone service is still out in
the fourth quadrant from Warren to Vermont.

01:09:36.742 --> 01:09:40.703
Telephone repair vehicle does not
respond to radio communication.

01:09:40.787 --> 01:09:44.999
Jesus Christ. We got a war going on
down here and we can't find the damn thing.

01:09:45.084 --> 01:09:49.754
This is Unit Seven. We are making
a rapid circuit of Quadrant Four.

01:09:49.839 --> 01:09:54.091
Everything looks quiet and normal.
Nothing unusual to report at this time.

01:09:54.176 --> 01:09:55.552
We're gonna make another full circuit.

01:09:55.636 --> 01:09:59.889
Suggest backup vehicles
and helicopter surveillance, over.

01:09:59.974 --> 01:10:03.017
One-X-Five, as soon as
other units are available,

01:10:03.102 --> 01:10:05.311
they will be sent into your area.

01:10:05.396 --> 01:10:08.147
All helicopters are in use at this time.

01:10:08.232 --> 01:10:11.109
How the hell do they expect us
to find anything without backup?

01:10:11.193 --> 01:10:16.865
- It's that damn Saturday night overload.
- This is Unit Seven, 10-4.

01:10:19.368 --> 01:10:21.494
Hey, don't you want to check that street?

01:10:21.579 --> 01:10:23.705
- That's Gramercy, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

01:10:23.789 --> 01:10:27.000
- Nothing down there but the old station.
- Don't you wanna cruise it?

01:10:27.084 --> 01:10:28.334
What for?

01:10:38.762 --> 01:10:41.180
- It'll work.
- You guys are crazy.

01:10:41.265 --> 01:10:43.016
- You sure about the basement?
- I'm sure.

01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:44.642
- What if you're wrong?
- I said I was sure.

01:10:44.727 --> 01:10:45.768
But what if you're wrong?

01:10:45.853 --> 01:10:48.563
I've worked here for five years.
I ought to know the place.

01:11:01.410 --> 01:11:06.623
- Looks pretty good to me.
- Looks like hell, but it's all we got.

01:11:07.708 --> 01:11:09.000
Who goes?

01:11:10.419 --> 01:11:13.963
I gotta tell you,
I don't know how to hot wire a car.

01:11:16.133 --> 01:11:17.467
I'm a cop.

01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:25.266
- Between me and Snow White.
- Shit! Shit, shit!

01:11:25.351 --> 01:11:28.227
What's wrong?
We haven't flipped a coin yet.

01:11:28.312 --> 01:11:30.355
I'm gonna lose.

01:11:30.439 --> 01:11:34.233
- You got a bad attitude, Wells.
- I always lose.

01:11:34.318 --> 01:11:37.862
Had bad luck all my life.
How do you think I ended up in here?

01:11:37.947 --> 01:11:44.494
- Maybe it'll change.
- It might. If we don't flip a coin.

01:11:44.578 --> 01:11:46.955
- Let's do something else.
- What?

01:11:47.039 --> 01:11:48.331
Potatoes.

01:11:51.627 --> 01:11:53.002
All right.

01:11:58.425 --> 01:12:00.176
One potato, two potato,
three potato, four.

01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:01.803
Five potato, six potato, seven potato, more.

01:12:01.887 --> 01:12:04.639
Eight potato, nine potato, ten potato,
eleven. Kiss my ass and go to heaven.

01:12:04.723 --> 01:12:06.224
Y-O-U spells you.

01:12:06.308 --> 01:12:08.476
I told you I'd lose.
God damn it, we're gonna do it again.

01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:10.687
Hey, hey. There isn't time.

01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:17.902
- Well, how come she's out of it?
- All right, if I can do it with one arm.

01:12:20.531 --> 01:12:24.033
Still no sign of them. Let's get moving.

01:12:24.118 --> 01:12:28.830
- You want me to show you where it is?
- I'll take him down. You stay up here.

01:12:32.626 --> 01:12:35.920
It's right next to the furnace.
You can't miss it.

01:12:39.258 --> 01:12:42.135
Nobody gonna wish me luck?

01:12:42.219 --> 01:12:44.345
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

01:12:44.430 --> 01:12:49.017
Look at that. Two cops wishing me luck.
I'm doomed.

01:13:18.589 --> 01:13:24.093
Five feet down to the sewer,
20 yards straight ahead to the manhole.

01:13:24.178 --> 01:13:26.262
Right.

01:13:26.346 --> 01:13:30.516
What I wanna know is
what the hell is the difference between this

01:13:30.601 --> 01:13:34.604
- and what I was gonna do 10 minutes ago?
- No difference.

01:13:34.688 --> 01:13:37.315
But you stopped me then. Why not now?

01:13:40.652 --> 01:13:43.488
One thing, when you get out of here,

01:13:43.572 --> 01:13:48.409
make sure you call the cops
before you take off for the border, huh?

01:13:48.494 --> 01:13:51.454
Now, what makes you think I'd do that?

01:13:53.332 --> 01:13:55.124
I'll see you, Wilson.

01:14:46.426 --> 01:14:49.804
That basement's not a bad place to be
if they come at us again.

01:14:49.888 --> 01:14:52.515
The only way in is down
that long, narrow hallway.

01:14:52.599 --> 01:14:55.643
We might be able to hold them back
for a couple of minutes.

01:14:55.727 --> 01:14:57.311
We'd be trapped down there.

01:14:57.396 --> 01:15:00.857
But we're not gonna last up here
with only eight shots between us.

01:15:00.941 --> 01:15:03.985
The upstairs is out. Wide open up there.

01:15:09.241 --> 01:15:15.538
- Someone will come.
- A man with faith, a rare quality.

01:15:19.126 --> 01:15:20.585
What about you?

01:15:20.669 --> 01:15:23.963
I've never had too much faith
in anyone coming to my rescue.

01:15:24.047 --> 01:15:26.883
Maybe you've been associating
with the wrong people.

01:15:26.967 --> 01:15:33.431
- I've been with policemen for five years.
- That's enough to grow hair on a rock.

01:15:34.766 --> 01:15:38.019
- And you?
- I believe in one man.

01:15:38.103 --> 01:15:39.896
Hey! He's there!

01:15:43.317 --> 01:15:45.151
It's still clear. Move.

01:15:51.617 --> 01:15:53.951
What the hell is he waiting for?

01:15:55.621 --> 01:15:56.662
He's clear in front.

01:15:59.291 --> 01:16:00.458
Move, damn it!

01:16:04.546 --> 01:16:05.588
He's out.

01:16:15.641 --> 01:16:17.183
Go, you son of a bitch.

01:16:23.315 --> 01:16:24.398
They've seen him.

01:16:28.987 --> 01:16:29.987
Save it for us.

01:16:44.419 --> 01:16:46.337
He made it. He made it!

01:17:00.269 --> 01:17:02.436
- Go, go.
- Hit it, hit it!

01:17:06.191 --> 01:17:07.233
He's gonna make it.

01:17:26.378 --> 01:17:29.088
Maybe it was just a window breaking.

01:17:36.179 --> 01:17:38.139
Sons of bitches.

01:17:41.393 --> 01:17:46.731
Too bad, Wells.
He never got to see the border.

01:17:50.235 --> 01:17:55.448
We'd better get down in that basement.
Look, we're out of time, out of ammunition.

01:17:55.532 --> 01:17:58.993
Just like Wells, we're out of luck.
Take a look.

01:18:08.670 --> 01:18:09.920
Let's go.

01:19:04.893 --> 01:19:06.977
We can make one last stand.

01:19:07.062 --> 01:19:09.563
Take that sign,
put it down the end of the hallway.

01:19:09.648 --> 01:19:12.566
It'll help us stand them off.

01:19:12.651 --> 01:19:16.487
- What do we use to hold them back with?
- Anything we can find.

01:19:23.495 --> 01:19:28.958
- You still have the gun?
- Two shots. Do I save it for the two of us?

01:19:29.042 --> 01:19:32.753
You save them for the first two assholes
who come through that vent.

01:19:32.838 --> 01:19:36.757
They're bound to have seen Wells
come up out of the manhole.

01:19:36.842 --> 01:19:40.052
What do I use on the rest of them
that come climbing through?

01:19:40.137 --> 01:19:43.222
Then you'll have to wing it.

01:19:43.306 --> 01:19:48.436
None of us know who he is,
what happened to him, or what he's done.

01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:52.022
He could be anybody or anything.

01:19:52.107 --> 01:19:56.402
- I'm curious about one thing.
- Just one?

01:19:58.113 --> 01:20:02.283
No, there are other things, but at
the moment this one interests me the most.

01:20:02.367 --> 01:20:05.619
- What's that?
- Why didn't you climb through that vent

01:20:05.704 --> 01:20:08.747
and take off down the sewer
in the other direction?

01:20:08.832 --> 01:20:11.292
There are two things
a man should never run from,

01:20:11.376 --> 01:20:14.086
even if they cost him his life.

01:20:14.171 --> 01:20:18.132
One is a man who's helpless
and can't run with you.

01:20:18.216 --> 01:20:19.884
What's the other?

01:20:23.847 --> 01:20:25.931
Come here a minute, Wilson.

01:20:28.727 --> 01:20:32.188
The very least of our problems
is we've run out of time.

01:20:32.272 --> 01:20:37.526
It's an old story with me.
I was born out of time.

01:20:50.081 --> 01:20:54.001
Acetylene tank, magnesium flares.

01:20:54.085 --> 01:20:58.756
We strap the flares onto the tank
then tie them both up on that pipe.

01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:03.594
I stand in the doorway with my rifle.
I shoot the flares, they ignite the tank.

01:21:05.388 --> 01:21:08.974
We blow the hell out of
everybody in this hallway!

01:21:09.059 --> 01:21:12.978
And what's gonna keep it
from blowing the hell out of us?

01:21:13.063 --> 01:21:16.440
You hold up that sign
in front of the door for cover.

01:21:18.777 --> 01:21:22.613
- Can you hit it from there?
- I got three shots. That's enough.

01:21:25.534 --> 01:21:28.536
- Can't argue with a confident man.
- Let's go.

01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:43.008
This is Unit Seven. We've just checked
the fire lane between Gramercy and Imperial.

01:21:43.093 --> 01:21:47.429
Dark, quiet and deserted.
Request instructions, over.

01:21:47.514 --> 01:21:49.807
What are those cars doing over there?

01:21:49.891 --> 01:21:51.725
There's supposed to be
a few people on duty.

01:21:51.810 --> 01:21:54.061
They've been moving things out of there
for the past couple of weeks.

01:21:54.145 --> 01:21:58.148
They're probably between here
and the new station.

01:21:58.233 --> 01:22:00.234
We're wasting time here.

01:22:19.296 --> 01:22:22.798
I don't know.
There's something funny back there.

01:22:22.882 --> 01:22:25.092
One-X-Five, we have
continued reports

01:22:25.176 --> 01:22:27.094
of gunfire between Ninth and Warren.

01:22:27.178 --> 01:22:29.138
How come we don't hear a goddamn thing?

01:22:29.222 --> 01:22:31.140
Most reports are from residents

01:22:31.224 --> 01:22:34.476
who are unable to pinpoint
the location of the gunfire.

01:22:34.561 --> 01:22:38.439
The telephone repair vehicle
is officially reported lost.

01:22:38.523 --> 01:22:42.151
We are sending four backup units in
to assist you.

01:22:42.235 --> 01:22:45.613
This is Unit Seven.
Still nothing unusual to report.

01:22:45.697 --> 01:22:48.616
We cannot locate the source of the gunfire.

01:22:48.700 --> 01:22:52.036
Repeat request for immediate
helicopter surveillance. Over.

01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:54.913
One-X-Five, as soon as
a helicopter is available,

01:22:54.998 --> 01:22:56.457
we will send it in.

01:22:56.541 --> 01:22:58.959
This is Unit Seven, 10-4.

01:23:01.755 --> 01:23:03.339
There's something wrong here somewhere.

01:23:04.549 --> 01:23:08.844
Would you listen to that?
It's starting to rain. Just what we need.

01:23:08.928 --> 01:23:11.930
There's something funny
about that old station back there.

01:23:12.015 --> 01:23:16.226
Hey, that's not rain. What the hell is that?

01:23:24.736 --> 01:23:26.236
Jesus Christ.

01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:35.663
This is Unit Seven, emergency
to all precincts and vehicles.

01:23:35.747 --> 01:23:37.539
Emergency. Emergency.

01:23:53.264 --> 01:23:57.559
Molotov cocktails.
They'll set the goddamn place on fire.

01:23:57.644 --> 01:23:59.019
This is it.

01:24:01.648 --> 01:24:02.940
Let's go.

01:24:58.705 --> 01:25:02.583
- Sorry.
- Kind of pretty.

01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:08.922
Can I ask you a question?

01:25:11.301 --> 01:25:15.262
Being a cop,
I figured you'd get around to it eventually.

01:25:18.016 --> 01:25:22.144
How did you come to be
named Napoleon Wilson?

01:25:22.228 --> 01:25:24.146
I'll tell you sometime.

01:25:26.399 --> 01:25:29.693
- When will you tell me?
- Maybe in a minute or two.

01:26:19.869 --> 01:26:22.287
Can't argue with a confident man!

01:27:48.333 --> 01:27:50.208
Anybody got a smoke?

01:28:16.736 --> 01:28:19.196
We have a stretcher for you, miss.

01:28:22.408 --> 01:28:23.742
Miss.

01:28:56.317 --> 01:28:57.985
Get away from him!

01:29:13.376 --> 01:29:16.628
It would be a privilege
if you'd walk outside with me.

01:29:18.548 --> 01:29:20.132
I know it would.

01:29:24.595 --> 01:29:26.763
You're pretty fancy, Wilson.
