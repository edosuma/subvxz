<i>Mysteries in History,
with your host, Peter Graves.</i>

00:30.031 --> 00:33.951
<i>Although no one has ever been able
to prove their existence,</i>

00:34.118 --> 00:37.288
<i>a quasi-government agency,
the Men in Black,</i>

00:37.455 --> 00:40.791
<i>supposedly carries out operations
here on Earth</i>

00:40.958 --> 00:45.046
<i>in order to keep us safe from aliens
throughout the galaxies.</i>

00:45.212 --> 00:48.716
<i>Here is one of their stories
that "never happened"</i>

00:48.883 --> 00:53.095
<i>from one of their files
that doesn't exist.</i>

00:53.679 --> 00:57.850
<i>1978. The leaders of Zartha
flee their planet</i>

00:58.017 --> 01:03.272
<i>in order to escape the clutches
of the evil Kylothian, Serleena.</i>

01:03.773 --> 01:07.651
<i>- Arriving on Earth, the Zarthans bring</i>-

01:08.027 --> 01:12.073
<i>The Light of Zartha,
a cosmic force so powerful,</i>

01:12.239 --> 01:16.786
<i>that in the wrong hands it could
lead to the annihilation of Zartha.</i>

01:17.286 --> 01:20.664
<i>The Zarthans' princess, Lauranna,
beseeched the Men in Black,</i>

01:20.831 --> 01:23.209
<i>to hide the Light from Serleena.</i>

01:23.709 --> 01:25.669
<i>But they had no choice.</i>

01:25.836 --> 01:29.340
<i>Intervention would have meant
the destruction of the Earth.</i>

01:30.716 --> 01:35.846
<i>However, in an act of galactic bravery,
the Men in Black subdued Serleena,</i>

01:36.013 --> 01:38.224
<i>allowing the Zarthans to escape</i>

01:38.390 --> 01:42.061
<i>so they might hide the Light
on another planet.</i>

01:43.187 --> 01:47.858
<i>Serleena, released from her captors,
vowed that the Light would be hers,</i>

01:48.025 --> 01:52.947
<i>and that she would destroy
any planet that stood in her way.</i>

01:54.156 --> 01:56.909
<i>And so,
never knowing what happened,</i>

01:57.076 --> 02:02.289
<i>the people of Earth were saved
by a secret society of protectors</i>

02:02.456 --> 02:05.543
<i>known as the Men in Black.</i>

03:44.683 --> 03:46.560
Harvey!

03:47.645 --> 03:50.189
Harvey, get over here!

03:50.648 --> 03:52.858
Harvey. Heel, heel!

03:53.025 --> 03:55.277
You're barking at the moon, moron.

03:55.444 --> 03:57.196
Harvey. Harvey!

03:57.363 --> 03:58.572
Harvey!

05:58.525 --> 06:00.319
Hey, pretty lady.

06:01.278 --> 06:02.946
You taste good.

06:07.117 --> 06:08.160
Hey, what the...?

06:13.499 --> 06:15.918
Yeah, you too.

07:04.967 --> 07:07.428
Nothing fancy, no heroics.
By the book.

07:07.594 --> 07:09.054
Got it. Hey!

07:09.221 --> 07:12.516
Ooh. Hey, Jeff.
What's happening, buddy?

07:12.683 --> 07:16.687
We were wondering why you're here.
The man's talking to you.

07:17.020 --> 07:21.108
You know our arrangements.
Stay in the E, F and R subway lines

07:21.275 --> 07:23.694
and you get all the garbage
you want.

07:23.861 --> 07:26.572
What the hell are you doing here,
worm boy?

07:26.738 --> 07:29.741
Uh, Tee. Jeff, uh...

07:29.908 --> 07:32.119
Excuse my partner.
He's new and he's...

07:37.082 --> 07:39.209
- ...Kind of stupid.
- Whoa!

07:45.966 --> 07:48.927
You getting big, Jeff.
Boy, what you been eating?

07:52.264 --> 07:54.308
Oh. You like jokes, huh?

07:57.436 --> 07:59.021
Jeffrey!

08:04.860 --> 08:05.986
Ah!

08:06.153 --> 08:07.404
All right.

08:08.864 --> 08:10.699
Sweet dreams, big boy.

08:45.734 --> 08:47.277
Sweet dreams...

08:52.032 --> 08:53.492
...big boy.

08:53.659 --> 08:56.453
Transit authority.
Move to the forward car.

08:56.620 --> 08:59.206
We got a bug
in the electrical system.

09:00.541 --> 09:06.296
Yo! People! We got a bug
in the electrical system!

09:10.133 --> 09:11.843
Now y'all running'?

09:12.010 --> 09:13.720
No, no, no! Sit down!

09:13.887 --> 09:15.847
It's only a 600-foot worm.

09:19.142 --> 09:23.188
Everybody out before I knock heads.
Put the hammer down on this thing.

09:23.355 --> 09:26.483
I'm Captain Larry Bridgewater.
I decide what happens.

09:26.650 --> 09:29.653
Oh, oh. You decide? Oh.
Okay, come here. Come here.

09:29.820 --> 09:31.863
Larry? That's my man, Jeff.

09:35.200 --> 09:39.371
Larry just made a decision.
Larry need to take his ass in there.

09:46.878 --> 09:49.339
Don't make me do this, Jeff!

10:15.198 --> 10:17.034
Eighty-first Street.

10:21.079 --> 10:22.205
Just a second.

10:23.540 --> 10:26.376
May I have your attention, please?

10:26.918 --> 10:29.796
We thank you
for participating in our drill.

10:29.963 --> 10:33.050
Had this been an emergency,
you'd have been eaten.

10:33.216 --> 10:35.761
Because you don't listen.
You're ignorant.

10:35.927 --> 10:40.098
How a man gonna bash through...?
That's the problem with New Yorkers.

10:40.265 --> 10:43.894
"We've seen it all. A 600-foot worm!
Save us, Mr. Black Man!"

10:44.061 --> 10:48.273
I ask you nice, "Move to the next
car." You just sit there like...

10:50.233 --> 10:51.902
Thank you for participating.

10:52.069 --> 10:55.947
Hopefully, you enjoyed our smaller,
energy-efficient subway cars.

10:56.406 --> 10:59.534
Watch your step.
You will have a nice evening.

11:03.080 --> 11:06.708
I need a cleanup crew
at 81st and Central Park West.

11:06.875 --> 11:09.378
Revoke Jeff's movement privileges.

11:09.544 --> 11:12.381
Have him escorted
to the Chambers Street station.

11:12.547 --> 11:17.511
And please check the expiration date
on the unipod worm tranquilizers.

11:21.848 --> 11:23.684
Sorry, fellas. Station closed.

11:23.975 --> 11:28.230
Emergency drill. For your safety.
Do you believe these putzes?

11:29.815 --> 11:31.316
You're welcome.

11:44.996 --> 11:47.249
I know, by the book.

11:47.416 --> 11:51.878
Tee, when was the last time
we just looked at the stars?

11:52.045 --> 11:55.048
This is a test. I can do this.

11:57.467 --> 12:00.053
Ever feel like you're alone
in the universe?

12:00.220 --> 12:01.722
Yes.

12:03.724 --> 12:05.350
No.

12:07.644 --> 12:10.647
Hey, let me buy you a piece of pie.
Really?

12:11.398 --> 12:12.649
Thanks.

12:13.400 --> 12:16.153
Hey, you're not alone
in the universe.

12:16.319 --> 12:18.530
Remove the arm.
Okay.

12:21.533 --> 12:23.827
Please, shut up, Charlie.

12:23.994 --> 12:27.414
I'm tired of you constantly talking
behind my back.

12:29.166 --> 12:33.044
You meet a girl. She's into it.
The best line you come up with is:

12:33.211 --> 12:36.298
"Wanna come back to my place for
some tonsil hockey and egg salad?"

12:36.465 --> 12:39.342
Whoa! Who are you
and how'd you get in?

12:39.509 --> 12:41.178
You like egg salad?

12:44.473 --> 12:45.849
Serleena!

12:46.016 --> 12:49.269
Why didn't you say it was you?

12:50.061 --> 12:52.647
- Where's the Light?
- Here's the deal.

12:52.814 --> 12:55.192
You're looking for this Light.
We found it.

12:55.358 --> 12:59.654
You want it, it'll cost you 50 mill.
Here's how it'll work. First...

12:59.821 --> 13:02.365
Where is the Light?

13:07.704 --> 13:12.042
We couldn't find it, but we found
a guy who might know where it is.

13:12.209 --> 13:15.253
He runs a pizza parlor
on Spring Street.

13:16.546 --> 13:20.383
Let's go.
And wipe your nose, idiot.

13:25.597 --> 13:29.559
Mmm. Oh. Good pie.
Yeah.

13:31.061 --> 13:32.562
Crowded.

13:32.729 --> 13:34.523
Well, they got good pie.

13:39.986 --> 13:41.321
What is wrong with you?

13:41.488 --> 13:43.698
You're gonna neuralyze me.
No, I'm not.

13:43.865 --> 13:46.409
You took me here
so I wouldn't make a scene.

13:46.576 --> 13:48.411
You making a scene.

13:49.079 --> 13:52.415
Let me ask you a question.
Why did you join MiB?

13:52.582 --> 13:56.127
Six years in the Marines.
I like the action. Protect the planet.

13:56.294 --> 13:59.589
You like being a hero?
You joined the wrong organization.

14:00.298 --> 14:03.760
You ever heard of James Edwards?
No.

14:04.219 --> 14:07.931
Well, he saved the lives of 85 people
on the subway tonight.

14:08.098 --> 14:10.141
No one knows he exists.

14:10.642 --> 14:14.563
And if no one knows he exists,
how can anyone ever love him?

14:19.317 --> 14:21.570
Hey, how long we been partners?

14:21.736 --> 14:24.698
Feb 1.
Five months, three days.

14:24.865 --> 14:27.576
Started at noon.
Nine hours.

14:34.624 --> 14:37.085
Get married.
Have a bunch of kids.

14:37.586 --> 14:39.254
Okay.

14:41.965 --> 14:47.512
Excuse me. My buddy's kind of shy,
but he thinks you are hot.

14:52.809 --> 14:55.312
Here it is. Ta-da.

14:55.478 --> 14:57.147
Ben, I don't know what to say.

14:57.314 --> 15:00.025
Years from now,
you know what people'll say?

15:00.191 --> 15:03.528
"Employee" is spelled wrong?
Eh, they charge by the letter.

15:03.695 --> 15:07.824
They'll say, "imagine that. Big shot
like her used to work here."

15:07.991 --> 15:09.409
Ben...
You deserve it.

15:09.576 --> 15:12.704
Bring up a case of Mountain Dew
from the basement.

15:15.498 --> 15:17.292
Hey, Bruno.

15:18.293 --> 15:22.839
Two slices of pepperoni and
information about the Light of Zartha.

15:23.006 --> 15:26.343
- Whoever you are, don't hurt me.
- Where's the Light, Ben?

15:26.509 --> 15:28.136
I don't know what
you're talking about.

15:28.303 --> 15:31.056
Let me down, ma'am.
I want to report a robbery...

15:39.689 --> 15:41.316
There.

15:41.858 --> 15:43.151
Noise.

15:44.653 --> 15:46.112
Kitchen!
Oh.

15:50.116 --> 15:52.202
You idiots see anything?

15:52.369 --> 15:55.413
Wind blew the door open.

15:56.081 --> 15:58.041
Nothing out of the ordinary.

15:58.416 --> 16:01.544
For 25 years, I've traveled
the universe looking for it.

16:01.711 --> 16:04.673
But it never left Earth, did it?
You kept it here.

16:04.839 --> 16:06.549
What are you talking about?

16:06.716 --> 16:09.260
I'm running out of time.
Where's the Light?

16:09.427 --> 16:12.222
- I don't know what you mean.
- Listen, Zarthan.

16:12.389 --> 16:14.975
You hid the Light on Earth.
I'll find it.

16:15.141 --> 16:18.687
Once we have the Light,
Zartha will be ours.

16:18.853 --> 16:21.398
You're too late.
Tomorrow at midnight,

16:21.564 --> 16:25.110
the Light will leave
the third planet and be back home.

16:25.276 --> 16:27.612
Sorry you made the trip for nothing.

16:37.831 --> 16:40.417
Now we don't know
if it's on Earth or not.

16:40.583 --> 16:42.961
He said third planet.
It's here, you idiot.

16:43.128 --> 16:46.840
<i>Third Rock</i> from the Sun.
I never got that till now.

16:47.340 --> 16:51.219
It's on Earth, and I know
who's gonna tell me where it is.

17:16.036 --> 17:18.704
Don't you ever go home?
Nope.

17:18.872 --> 17:21.665
I see you neuralyzed
another partner.

17:28.256 --> 17:30.925
Bee, Dee, when you use
a fission carbonizer,

17:31.092 --> 17:34.804
attach a de-atomizer
so it doesn't sound like a cannon.

17:34.971 --> 17:38.308
Hey, get some booties on them things.
You're crapping up the floor.

17:42.687 --> 17:44.105
Check his visa.

17:44.272 --> 17:48.443
The Cephalopods have been making
counterfeits at Kinko's on Canal.

17:48.610 --> 17:53.865
Why do I have a dead Tricrainasloph
going through passport control?

17:54.032 --> 17:58.203
That'd be my fault. I'm very sorry.
Please don't neuralyze me, sir.

17:58.369 --> 18:01.623
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing, sir.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.003
Good work in the subway.

18:07.170 --> 18:09.005
I remember Jeff
when he was yea high.

18:09.172 --> 18:11.049
What you got for me?

18:11.216 --> 18:13.510
Look. See those guys in black suits?

18:13.676 --> 18:16.763
They work here. We got it covered.
Zed, what you got?

18:16.930 --> 18:21.184
Dedication's one thing, but this job
will eat you up and spit you out.

18:21.351 --> 18:24.312
You want to look like me
when you hit 50...

18:25.605 --> 18:26.648
ish?

18:27.524 --> 18:29.734
I'll be in the gym if you need me.

18:30.360 --> 18:33.738
All right, there was a killing earlier.
177 Spring.

18:33.905 --> 18:35.198
Alien-on-alien.

18:35.365 --> 18:37.909
Take Tee with you
and make a report.

18:38.076 --> 18:40.912
Um... Tee. Right.

18:41.079 --> 18:43.498
What happened...
What happened with Tee...

18:43.665 --> 18:46.668
Passports. No rush.
How they hanging, Jay?

18:46.835 --> 18:49.879
You have got to stop neuralyzing
MiB personnel.

18:50.046 --> 18:52.257
He was crying
in the middle of the diner.

18:52.423 --> 18:53.967
I hate that.

18:54.551 --> 18:56.761
And plus, you can't count Elle.

18:56.928 --> 18:59.889
She wanted to go back
to the morgue. I helped her.

19:00.056 --> 19:02.934
You need a partner.
I'm cool.

19:03.226 --> 19:05.228
I'll be his partner.

19:06.104 --> 19:09.107
Jay, wait up.
I appreciate the shot, man.

19:09.274 --> 19:11.484
Thought I'd never get out.
Lose the suit.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.862
Sure thing.
Just going for the look.

19:14.028 --> 19:16.739
But if I say so myself,
I find it slimming.

19:16.906 --> 19:19.534
Not that I've had problems
with the ladies.

19:19.701 --> 19:21.286
When you get down to... Whoa.

19:21.452 --> 19:23.204
Nice sled, very swank.

19:23.371 --> 19:25.498
Heated seats?
Sometimes I get hives.

19:46.936 --> 19:48.271
Frank!

19:49.230 --> 19:52.775
Bring your head in this window
before I roll it up in there.

19:52.942 --> 19:54.319
Got it.

20:00.325 --> 20:01.784
Frank!

20:03.203 --> 20:04.996
My money? It's missionary.

20:05.163 --> 20:08.249
I was in the Bowery,
and I meet this Great Dane.

20:08.416 --> 20:10.668
A little thick in the body,
but pretty.

20:10.835 --> 20:13.963
That's just not appealing
to me, man. Seriously.

20:14.130 --> 20:16.424
I say we do the
good cop, bad cop thing.

20:16.591 --> 20:19.135
You interrogate the witness
and I growl. Grrr!

20:19.302 --> 20:23.556
How about we do the good cop, dumb
dog thing, and you just shut up?

20:23.723 --> 20:26.100
You got it, partner.
Total silence.

20:26.267 --> 20:29.604
Absolute quiet.
Not a word out of me.

20:30.313 --> 20:31.940
What do we got?

20:32.774 --> 20:33.816
Zip.

20:34.651 --> 20:37.528
What do we got?
There's residue on the wall.

20:37.695 --> 20:42.617
We sent samples to Em for analysis.
Hey, Jay, zero percent body fat.

20:45.370 --> 20:47.038
Funny.
Witness?

20:47.956 --> 20:49.540
Girl. Saw everything.

20:50.333 --> 20:52.293
She's taking it well.

20:52.460 --> 20:56.631
I won't answer any more questions.
I want to know what happened here.

20:56.965 --> 20:59.092
- I'll handle this one.
- You got it.

20:59.259 --> 21:02.637
Alone. A talking dog might be
a bit much for her now.

21:02.804 --> 21:04.847
What do you want me to do?

21:05.181 --> 21:06.349
Sniff around.

21:08.101 --> 21:09.352
What?

21:09.852 --> 21:10.979
Funny.

21:11.145 --> 21:13.606
Take a deep breath.
Everything is all right.

21:13.773 --> 21:16.901
What part is she supposed
to feel all right about?

21:20.154 --> 21:21.698
I'm Agent Jay.

21:21.864 --> 21:23.366
Tell me what you saw.

21:23.533 --> 21:26.035
A two-headed guy and a woman.
Caucasian?

21:26.202 --> 21:29.205
Gray, with tentacles
that she used to rip...

21:29.372 --> 21:30.456
His skin off.

21:30.623 --> 21:35.920
It's not skin. It's protoplasma polymer
similar to the gum in baseball cards.

21:36.087 --> 21:38.673
What was the last thing you ate?
Calzone.

21:38.840 --> 21:39.966
What time?
Lunch.

21:40.133 --> 21:41.467
Spinach?
Mushroom.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.219
Hm.

21:43.386 --> 21:44.929
You need pie.

21:45.888 --> 21:48.099
They kept asking Ben about a light.

21:48.266 --> 21:50.476
Light of Zartha,
something like that.

21:50.977 --> 21:52.520
You okay?

21:52.687 --> 21:55.982
An hour ago, a man I've known
my whole life vanished

21:56.149 --> 21:58.735
because of a woman with
things coming out her fingers

21:58.901 --> 22:01.612
and a two-headed guy
with the IQ of a cannoli.

22:01.779 --> 22:04.449
So yeah, everything's okay.

22:06.034 --> 22:09.746
When we're kids,
before we're taught how to think,

22:09.912 --> 22:13.249
our hearts tell us there is
something else out there.

22:13.416 --> 22:18.338
I know what I saw. Tell me
what I'm supposed to believe.

22:23.968 --> 22:29.098
I'm a member of a secret organization
that monitors alien activity on Earth.

22:29.265 --> 22:31.476
Ben was an alien.
So were his killers.

22:31.642 --> 22:35.646
I don't know why they did it,
but I promise I'm gonna find out.

22:36.939 --> 22:38.900
Okay.

22:39.275 --> 22:41.819
Okay?
Okay.

22:43.237 --> 22:44.655
Okay.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.786
Uh... Uh...

22:49.952 --> 22:52.747
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to...
Kill me.

22:52.914 --> 22:54.457
No! Ha-ha.

22:54.624 --> 22:58.544
Just a little flash and everything
goes back the way it was.

22:58.961 --> 23:02.298
After you flash me,

23:02.465 --> 23:04.926
if I see you again,
will I know it's you?

23:05.093 --> 23:07.136
I'll see you.

23:09.806 --> 23:11.516
But you won't see me.

23:11.682 --> 23:13.768
Must be hard.

23:13.935 --> 23:15.812
Must be very lonely.

23:31.577 --> 23:32.620
Excuse me.

23:33.955 --> 23:36.958
I gotta go.
What about the flashy thing?

23:37.125 --> 23:40.753
Uh... I'll flash you
some other time.

23:58.855 --> 24:00.189
What?

24:04.694 --> 24:10.199
Did you tell the girl you love her?
She's a witness to a crime. That's it.

24:10.408 --> 24:14.495
Yada, yada. You're attracted. She's
not my species, and I'm attracted.

24:14.662 --> 24:18.624
I should take advice on love from
a dude that chases his own ass?

24:18.791 --> 24:22.837
Easy, pal. That's canine profiling,
and I resent it.

24:39.562 --> 24:40.897
Hey, Jay, wait up.

24:41.063 --> 24:44.066
Coming through. MiB brass.
Look sharp.

24:44.233 --> 24:48.196
I'm Agent Eff, Jay's new partner.
Who are you eyeballing, huh?

24:48.362 --> 24:50.615
Frank, just cool out, dog.

24:52.408 --> 24:53.951
Got kids?
No.

24:54.118 --> 24:55.161
Want them?

24:58.789 --> 25:00.750
Get him off me!

25:09.133 --> 25:11.761
<i>Talk to me.</i>
It's Kylothian, class C.

25:11.928 --> 25:12.970
<i>Serleena.</i>

25:13.137 --> 25:15.473
<i>Serleena. Old girlfriend?</i>
She wishes.

25:15.640 --> 25:18.351
<i>The perps were looking
for the Light of...</i>

25:18.518 --> 25:20.186
Zartha.
<i>Yeah, what is it?</i>

25:20.353 --> 25:22.813
This makes no sense.
It's not on Earth.

25:22.980 --> 25:26.275
We took care of this a long time ago.
Obviously not.

25:26.442 --> 25:28.444
<i>That is very bad news.</i>

25:28.611 --> 25:32.323
The Zarthans came to Earth
to hide the Light from Serleena.

25:32.490 --> 25:35.993
<i>We don't do that.</i>
Right. I ordered it off the planet.

25:36.160 --> 25:37.787
Well, Zed...

25:37.954 --> 25:42.416
I got a Kylothian class C in my park.
Are you sure this Light isn't here?

25:42.583 --> 25:46.170
Positive. I gave the order.
My best agent carried it out.

25:46.337 --> 25:48.923
It's as if I gave the order to you.
Ask <i>the</i> agent.

25:49.090 --> 25:50.174
Can't.
<i>Dead?</i>

25:50.341 --> 25:52.718
Sort of. He works at the post office.

25:54.679 --> 25:55.805
No.

25:55.972 --> 25:58.641
<i>If Serleena gets to Kay
before we do, he's dead.</i>

25:58.808 --> 26:01.852
The Earth's very existence
may rest on what Kay knows.

26:02.019 --> 26:04.480
Too bad you wiped out
his memory of it.

26:04.647 --> 26:06.148
Bring him in.

26:06.482 --> 26:07.525
Now.

26:07.692 --> 26:11.779
How cool is this? Going to get Kay.
The legend, the go-to guy.

26:11.946 --> 26:14.490
Your mentor, the guy who taught you
everything you know.

26:14.657 --> 26:19.287
- The greatest agent in MiB history!
- Frank! Stop talking.

26:23.082 --> 26:24.375
Stay.

26:24.542 --> 26:28.296
Listen, partner. I may look like a dog,
but I only play one here on Earth.

26:30.172 --> 26:33.050
Whatever. Wipe your mouth.
Hey, babe.

26:39.181 --> 26:42.310
People of Truro, may I
kindly have your attention?

26:42.476 --> 26:44.895
To facilitate your shipping needs,

26:45.062 --> 26:47.732
all packages must be
properly wrapped.

26:47.898 --> 26:51.777
This one is an example of
"go home and do it again."

26:51.944 --> 26:54.739
I think you know what I mean,
Mrs. Vigushin. Heh, heh.

26:54.905 --> 26:59.785
Brown paper and triple-twist twine
are the preferred media.

26:59.952 --> 27:01.704
Thank you for your time.

27:03.039 --> 27:05.791
Kay.
C. Express mail, two-day air.

27:07.710 --> 27:10.379
Kevin. Heh. Wow.

27:10.546 --> 27:13.758
Kevin. That's funny.
You don't have a "Kevin"...

27:16.510 --> 27:18.721
You don't remember.
We worked together.

27:18.888 --> 27:23.017
I never worked in a funeral home.
Something I can do for you, slick?

27:23.184 --> 27:24.810
Straight to the point.

27:25.561 --> 27:29.774
You were an agent of an organization
that monitors aliens on Earth.

27:29.940 --> 27:34.028
We're the Men in Black. We have
a situation. We need your help.

27:34.195 --> 27:37.907
There is a free mental health clinic on
the corner of Lilac and East Valley.

27:38.074 --> 27:40.076
- Next.
- Excuse me.

27:40.576 --> 27:42.620
- Twenty <i>Rugrats</i> stamps.
- Elizabeth.

27:42.787 --> 27:47.083
The Postal Service hasn't kept up
with today's youth, but we have

27:47.249 --> 27:49.919
Berlin airlift stamps. Opera legends?
No. No.

27:50.086 --> 27:53.089
American Samoa? Amish quilts.
No.

27:53.255 --> 27:55.966
I'm sorry, got a world to save here.

27:57.343 --> 27:59.387
There was no coma.
It was a cover.

27:59.553 --> 28:01.347
Who are you?
Who are you?

28:01.514 --> 28:05.810
Postmaster of Truro, Massachusetts,
and I'm ordering you to leave.

28:08.729 --> 28:10.189
Is that decaf?
Sorry.

28:10.356 --> 28:12.733
We have a breach.
Cordon off this area.

28:12.900 --> 28:15.903
Full perimeter wipe-down,
right here, right now.

28:16.070 --> 28:20.449
Get a mop and escort all civilian
personnel from this site immediately.

28:20.616 --> 28:23.786
Listen to yourself, Kay.
Who talks like that?

28:30.835 --> 28:32.211
Boo.

29:19.800 --> 29:22.678
Why do you think you're
so comfortable here?

29:24.221 --> 29:27.850
Just about everybody who works
in a post office is an alien.

29:35.733 --> 29:36.901
No smoking.

29:46.702 --> 29:47.828
Kay.

29:48.120 --> 29:51.749
My wife and I saw Siegfried and Roy
fly a tiger around a room.

29:51.916 --> 29:53.417
You're nothing special.

29:53.584 --> 29:56.504
When you look at the stars,
you get a feeling,

29:56.670 --> 29:58.672
like you don't know who you are.

29:58.839 --> 30:02.468
Like you know more about out there
than you do down here.

30:02.635 --> 30:07.223
That's why she left you, Kay.
That's why your wife left you.

30:09.225 --> 30:11.060
Okay, I'll tell you what.

30:11.227 --> 30:15.147
You want to know who you really are,
take a ride with me.

30:15.314 --> 30:19.193
If not, people are waiting
for their <i>TV Guides.</i>

30:22.363 --> 30:23.864
Think he'll bite?

30:29.745 --> 30:33.499
I'm just going for a ride. If things
don't add up, it's <i>hasta luego.</i>

30:33.666 --> 30:35.251
Hey, Kay.

30:36.585 --> 30:38.838
How's it hanging?

30:53.143 --> 30:54.979
Good to see you, Kay.

30:55.145 --> 30:58.232
Good to see you too,
whoever you are.

30:59.608 --> 31:03.779
Well, let's see
what you got here, chief.

31:14.248 --> 31:16.542
Welcome back, Agent Kay.

31:17.793 --> 31:19.086
Agent Kay.

31:19.670 --> 31:21.714
Greetings, Kay.

31:23.966 --> 31:25.301
Wow, look who's back.

31:25.467 --> 31:28.012
I don't mean to bother you...
You're Agent Kay!

31:28.178 --> 31:31.348
That's what they tell me.
This is an honor. Agent Gee.

31:31.515 --> 31:33.976
The most respected agent
in MiB history.

31:34.143 --> 31:36.645
The most feared human
in the universe.

31:36.812 --> 31:39.815
Maybe I could
buy you a cup of coffee?

31:39.982 --> 31:42.651
Black, two sugars, if you're going.
An honor.

31:42.818 --> 31:46.155
- Yeah, I'll take a... My man?
- Good to see you, Kay.

31:47.823 --> 31:49.241
How'd it go?

31:49.408 --> 31:51.869
<i>The Drolacks are gone
and the treaty is signed.</i>

31:52.036 --> 31:53.078
Good work.

31:53.245 --> 31:56.540
<i>What about that position you
promised me in Men in Black?</i>

31:56.707 --> 32:00.169
Still working on the alien
affirmative action program.

32:00.336 --> 32:02.588
<i>That's not what you promised me.</i>

32:02.755 --> 32:04.840
You're breaking up
<i>Zed? Hello?</i>

32:05.007 --> 32:08.260
I'll call you back.
<i>I could be Agent Em. Zed, you...</i>

32:09.637 --> 32:14.141
I think Earth might be in a bad way.
You're the only one that could save it.

32:14.308 --> 32:17.394
Well, neither rain, sleet, snow...
Good man.

32:17.561 --> 32:21.482
Get him armed and up to speed
and over to deneuralyzation.

32:22.650 --> 32:23.776
Frank?
Yeah?

32:23.984 --> 32:25.945
I'm gonna need them together
on this one.

32:26.111 --> 32:27.196
Ouch.

32:27.363 --> 32:31.033
I need an assistant. It's not
field work, but you get dental.

32:31.200 --> 32:32.701
Dental?

32:35.454 --> 32:39.667
The most advanced technologies from all
over the universe are in this room.

32:39.833 --> 32:41.001
What's this?

32:42.920 --> 32:45.297
All is lost! All is lost!

32:46.382 --> 32:47.925
Don't touch that!

32:48.884 --> 32:50.761
I didn't do anything.

32:50.928 --> 32:54.098
Hands in your pockets.

33:03.524 --> 33:05.693
Your favorite weapon.

33:08.445 --> 33:10.739
That?
Yep.

33:11.240 --> 33:13.325
Let's go put it on.
What?

33:13.492 --> 33:15.828
The last suit you'll ever wear.

33:15.995 --> 33:17.496
Again.

33:17.663 --> 33:18.998
The...

33:24.670 --> 33:26.005
The deneuralyzer.

33:27.589 --> 33:30.634
Magneto-energy will surge
through your brain,

33:30.801 --> 33:35.431
unlocking information that could hold
the key to Earth's very survival.

33:35.597 --> 33:38.267
Okay. What's that thing?

33:39.601 --> 33:41.645
The deneuralyzer.

33:49.111 --> 33:53.115
Welcome to planet Earth. There
are some rules and regulations.

33:53.282 --> 33:54.700
Go out only at night.

33:54.867 --> 33:59.121
If you must go out during the
daylight, only the East Village.

34:03.542 --> 34:05.085
Hey, hey, hey!

34:09.297 --> 34:12.217
Name and planet of origin?

34:12.384 --> 34:16.138
Sylona Gorth. Planet Jorn.
Kaluth system.

34:17.139 --> 34:21.143
Any fruits or vegetables?
Yeah, two heads of cabbage.

34:21.310 --> 34:22.351
Reason for visit?

34:22.518 --> 34:26.023
Education. I want to learn
how to be an underwear model.

34:26.190 --> 34:28.942
They told me I've got real potential.
Hmm?

34:31.487 --> 34:33.280
Help! Heart attack!

34:34.489 --> 34:35.949
Clear!

34:37.201 --> 34:39.203
Wake up, champ!

34:44.416 --> 34:45.458
Oh, jeez.

34:45.626 --> 34:47.920
<i>Lockdown. Code 101.</i>

34:48.837 --> 34:50.797
<i>Lockdown.</i>

34:51.672 --> 34:54.342
This is not good.
This is not good.

35:01.016 --> 35:02.684
Breach! We're being flushed.

35:02.851 --> 35:04.019
Flushed?
Yep.

35:04.561 --> 35:06.647
Ever been to a water park?
I don't know.

35:40.472 --> 35:42.891
Whoo! Heh. Flushed. Heh.

35:44.351 --> 35:48.480
Yeah, man, back when you was
an agent, you loved getting flushed.

35:48.647 --> 35:53.235
Yeah, every Saturday night, you'd
be like, "Flush me, Jay. Flush me."

35:53.402 --> 35:55.154
I'd be like, "No."

35:56.780 --> 35:58.282
You can't quit on me.

35:58.448 --> 36:01.368
I save the world, you tell me
why I stare at the stars.

36:01.535 --> 36:03.078
Cool.

36:05.414 --> 36:07.124
Hop in.
Hop in what?

36:13.255 --> 36:16.133
Does that come standard?
It came with a black dude,

36:16.300 --> 36:19.094
but he kept getting pulled over.
Yep.

36:21.597 --> 36:26.476
Silly little planet. I could rule the place
with the right set of mammary glands.

36:26.852 --> 36:28.437
Trapped like rats

36:29.146 --> 36:30.230
in a Chia Pet.

36:30.397 --> 36:32.983
Computer, surveillance MiB.

36:36.695 --> 36:39.615
Hmm. MiB is locked down.

36:41.700 --> 36:45.287
Computer, magnify. Times 10.

36:46.455 --> 36:48.332
Communicator. Frank.

36:48.624 --> 36:50.959
- Jay, where are you?
<i>- We got flushed.</i>

36:51.126 --> 36:53.295
<i>MiB is code 101.</i>
Yeah, who did it?

36:53.462 --> 36:56.423
Some hot-looking biker chick.
Want me to tail her?

36:56.590 --> 37:01.470
Stay where you are. I'll be in touch.
Stay where I am. Easy for you to say.

37:01.637 --> 37:03.013
Find Kay?
Neuralyzed.

37:03.180 --> 37:05.807
Not active. Civilian.
What?

37:05.974 --> 37:07.017
He was...
Here.

37:07.184 --> 37:08.518
To get...
Deneuralyzed.

37:08.685 --> 37:13.232
Memory's shot. But we'll find him.
Don't put anything in our ears.

37:14.149 --> 37:15.192
What?

37:15.359 --> 37:18.820
What do you make of that?
Found it in my pocket. Weird, huh?

37:18.987 --> 37:21.740
Yeah, you're smiling.
Is that the only deneuralyzer?

37:21.907 --> 37:24.826
Officially. The plans leaked out
on the Internet.

37:24.993 --> 37:26.995
Computer, Internet.

37:27.162 --> 37:28.997
Deneuralyzer.

37:33.085 --> 37:35.045
Perfect. It's an old friend.

37:42.844 --> 37:44.846
Jay, ain't seen you in a while.

37:45.013 --> 37:47.766
Did you peep that drop-top thing
out front?

37:47.933 --> 37:50.060
My business is banging, dog.

37:50.560 --> 37:53.939
You gotta check out the website.
It's Jeebsie dot...

37:54.189 --> 37:56.191
Okay, whoa. He's retired, right?

37:56.650 --> 37:58.402
We need the deneuralyzer.

37:58.568 --> 38:01.905
You're kidding.
The meter's running, Jeebs.

38:04.324 --> 38:06.535
Do you remember me?

38:07.077 --> 38:09.204
Can't say I do.
I'm good with faces.

38:09.371 --> 38:11.164
Heh. I think I'd remember that.

38:12.708 --> 38:14.751
The great Kay's a neutral.

38:14.918 --> 38:19.214
You're between me and my memories. Do
you have this deneuralyzer or not?

38:19.381 --> 38:20.716
No.

38:21.883 --> 38:23.385
Fresh out.

38:24.594 --> 38:26.263
Can't help you. Heh.

38:28.348 --> 38:29.891
Don't got it.

38:38.567 --> 38:42.446
Even if I did, if it doesn't work,
he dies, you blow my head off.

38:42.612 --> 38:46.658
If it does, I've brought back Kay,
who, for fun, blows my head oh'.

38:46.825 --> 38:48.744
So, what's my incentive?

38:49.077 --> 38:53.248
Okay, homey, I keep it downstairs
next to the snow blowers.

38:56.668 --> 39:00.005
<i>Alien prisoners released,
armed and ready for your orders.</i>

39:00.172 --> 39:03.592
Prisoners of MiB,
the scum of the universe.

39:04.009 --> 39:05.594
Now it's the scum's turn.

39:05.761 --> 39:08.221
I'm in a jam,
so I'll make this simple.

39:08.638 --> 39:12.100
I need the Light of Zartha,
and Kay knows where it is.

39:12.267 --> 39:14.603
Whoever brings Kay to me
gets Earth.

39:14.770 --> 39:18.065
Find a deneuralyzer.
They want his memory back.

39:18.231 --> 39:20.067
Check.

39:20.734 --> 39:22.277
Now.

39:25.655 --> 39:27.616
Jarra, good to see you.

39:31.620 --> 39:33.497
Okay, that should do it.

39:33.663 --> 39:38.043
If I could have your attention while
we go over the safety procedures.

39:38.210 --> 39:40.754
Keep your hands inside
the vehicle.

39:40.921 --> 39:44.007
If, during the ride,
you become disoriented,

39:44.174 --> 39:46.843
there's nothing we can do about it.

39:48.303 --> 39:50.764
Have you removed all your jewelry?

39:52.349 --> 39:54.768
Are you allergic to shellfish?
Jeebs!

39:54.935 --> 39:57.729
Right, then!
Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

40:04.277 --> 40:05.695
Have you used this before?

40:05.904 --> 40:09.658
I used it to make some
hot-air popcorn. That's about it.

40:09.825 --> 40:12.786
Okay! Let's make it happen, cap'n!

40:44.401 --> 40:45.861
Hm.

41:07.966 --> 41:09.384
Perfect.

41:23.064 --> 41:25.150
You're back.
No.

41:25.317 --> 41:26.693
How'd you know
his head grows back?

41:26.860 --> 41:28.528
It grows back?

41:31.031 --> 41:34.910
Real nice. Okay, that's the
last time I help out a friend.

41:37.412 --> 41:39.915
Kay, you remember anything?
Goodbye.

41:40.081 --> 41:41.625
Kay, Wait! Kay!

41:42.459 --> 41:46.004
I never got the updated software.
Still working off the 6.0.

41:46.171 --> 41:48.089
Your brain needs to reboot.

41:49.341 --> 41:50.675
Give it a minute.

41:50.842 --> 41:52.260
Kay!

41:52.511 --> 41:57.766
Bottom of my heart, I'm really sorry.
I hope it won't affect our friendship.

41:57.933 --> 42:02.479
All those years of loyalty and trust,
respect for one another.

42:04.940 --> 42:06.233
Right over there!

42:07.776 --> 42:10.237
- Where's Kay?
- He's not here! He went...

42:10.445 --> 42:13.782
Kay's retired. I'm his
trigger-happy replacement.

42:13.949 --> 42:17.494
Right in the pie hole. Now
nothing's gonna taste right.

42:17.661 --> 42:20.121
Lower your weapon.
No.

42:25.627 --> 42:28.171
Jay, how are you, boo-boo?

42:28.338 --> 42:31.007
These guys really need Kay.
He's a neutral.

42:31.174 --> 42:34.844
Tell me something we don't know.
Yeah, tell me something... Achoo!

42:35.011 --> 42:36.638
I am so sorry.

42:36.805 --> 42:38.807
God bless you.
Thank you.

42:40.058 --> 42:44.104
If I don't bring Kay back to MiB,
Serleena's gonna kick my ass.

42:44.271 --> 42:46.314
Now, where is he?
Where is who?

42:46.481 --> 42:48.650
You don't look too good.

42:49.985 --> 42:51.653
Yeah, and you look like crap.

42:54.489 --> 42:57.325
I take that back. He look like crap.

42:59.953 --> 43:01.830
Bend him!
Bend him.

43:01.997 --> 43:03.873
Wait, don't bend him.

43:25.812 --> 43:28.106
Hey, honey, how you doing?

43:41.661 --> 43:43.455
Damn decent of you.

43:44.039 --> 43:45.332
Don't mention it.

44:06.186 --> 44:08.980
I'm gonna be sick.
You don't wanna do that.

44:09.147 --> 44:11.941
Fellas, I think he's telling the truth.
Then he's no good to us.

44:15.528 --> 44:18.531
Didn't I teach you anything, kid?
Pineal eye!

44:21.076 --> 44:22.786
Go for the mosh tendrils!

44:27.082 --> 44:28.833
Kay, he's a ball-chinnian.
Oh.

44:33.254 --> 44:35.799
You were in a tight spot.
I handled it.

44:35.965 --> 44:38.760
You need a partner.
I had one. Job got too tough.

44:38.927 --> 44:41.262
I'm back. You got
some dust on your coat.

44:41.429 --> 44:43.306
So you got your memory back.
Yeah.

44:43.473 --> 44:45.934
What the hell is going on?
Don't know.

44:46.101 --> 44:48.603
The Light of Zartha?
Never heard of it.

44:48.770 --> 44:49.771
Cool.

44:53.316 --> 44:55.443
You don't remember
the Light of Zartha?

44:55.610 --> 44:58.321
Must've neuralyzed myself
to keep it from myself.

44:58.488 --> 45:01.783
Good plan. What you doing?
I do the driving.

45:01.950 --> 45:03.952
Wait, no. Whoa, whoa.
I remember that.

45:04.119 --> 45:08.039
What you remember is you used
to drive that old, busted jawn.

45:08.206 --> 45:11.292
I drive the new hotness.

45:11.459 --> 45:15.088
Old and busted, new hotness.

45:24.013 --> 45:26.141
Old busted hotness.

45:26.474 --> 45:29.185
- Serleena, please.
- Been a long time, Zed.

45:29.352 --> 45:32.981
I'm just touched you remembered me.
Makes me fuzzy all over.

45:33.148 --> 45:36.484
Never forget a pretty
whatever you are.

45:37.318 --> 45:39.487
Unh!
Zed?

45:40.822 --> 45:42.490
Zed? Look at you.

45:42.657 --> 45:45.660
Twenty-five years,
and you're still such a looker.

45:45.827 --> 45:47.537
Cut out the meat and dairy.

45:47.704 --> 45:51.499
And you, still a pile of squirmy
crap in a different wrapper.

45:51.833 --> 45:55.503
So feisty.
Look, we both need the same thing.

45:58.423 --> 45:59.966
Bring him in.

46:00.633 --> 46:01.718
Don't think so.

46:01.885 --> 46:05.847
What about the Light's secret?
If it's not off Earth by midnight,

46:06.014 --> 46:09.476
it self-destructs,
annihilating your little planet.

46:09.642 --> 46:13.521
I lose, you lose.
I win, everything keeps spinning.

46:13.897 --> 46:17.859
You don't want the Light on Earth
any more than I do.

46:20.528 --> 46:22.197
All right, Serleena.

46:23.448 --> 46:25.033
You win.

46:26.910 --> 46:30.246
<i>Zed? Is that you?
I could be Agent Em.</i>

46:30.622 --> 46:32.040
<i>Zed. Hello?</i>

46:42.550 --> 46:44.636
So feisty.

46:49.098 --> 46:52.769
Fastest way back to MiB,
you take this right on 39th.

46:52.936 --> 46:54.521
Right here. Right.

46:56.689 --> 46:58.441
Next right on 37th.

46:58.608 --> 47:01.069
Right here.
Thirty... Thirty... Right!

47:01.402 --> 47:02.987
We're not going back to MiB.

47:03.154 --> 47:08.243
Headquarters has been breached. We
need to peel caps and split wigs.

47:08.409 --> 47:10.036
Not ready.

47:10.453 --> 47:13.915
Look, you've been out for five years.
That's a long time.

47:14.082 --> 47:17.210
I understand you're scared.
I'm a little scared too.

47:17.377 --> 47:19.420
I'm not scared.
Me neither.

47:20.004 --> 47:22.423
I just thought we was bonding.

47:23.258 --> 47:27.345
You're acting like a rookie
. Splitting wigs and stepping on caps.

47:27.512 --> 47:31.599
No wonder Zed brought me back.
He did it because you messed up.

47:31.766 --> 47:34.477
Your attitude makes for
a stressful environment.

47:34.644 --> 47:38.731
Tell it to the hand. Stressful
is what we got back at MiB.

47:38.898 --> 47:43.486
Exactly. Serleena broke into MiB
in order to lure me back.

47:43.653 --> 47:45.738
Into a trap.

47:45.905 --> 47:48.449
Which is why we can't
bust in there.

47:48.616 --> 47:51.619
We need a plan. Where we going?
Scene of the crime?

47:51.786 --> 47:55.999
You're the boss.
Scene of the crime. That's a left.

47:58.459 --> 48:00.962
I'll contact the witness.
We'll talk to her.

48:01.129 --> 48:04.382
Things have changed. We
used to neuralyze witnesses.

48:05.717 --> 48:07.468
See, originally, I'd, um...

48:08.469 --> 48:12.974
No, I was going to, uh...
I interrogated her.

48:13.141 --> 48:14.809
- Then neuralyzed her?
- What?

48:14.976 --> 48:20.356
MiB code 773/I-1 clearly states
that all civilian personnel...

48:21.357 --> 48:22.859
Drop that weapon!
No, no, no!

48:23.026 --> 48:24.652
Jay, I'm... I'm sorry.

48:24.819 --> 48:27.906
No, no, I'm fine. It's my fault.
Uh... Uh...

48:28.072 --> 48:30.533
Kay, my partner.
Laura, the witness.

48:30.700 --> 48:31.826
Pleasure.

48:33.119 --> 48:37.707
Thanks for sending those agents over
to keep an eye on me last night.

48:37.874 --> 48:39.876
MiB procedural code 594-B

48:40.043 --> 48:43.212
states that MiB personnel
shall never be used...

48:43.379 --> 48:48.718
Ben, the Zarthan, was vaporized here.
I assume the perp was over here.

48:48.885 --> 48:50.470
Ben.

48:50.637 --> 48:53.473
Was he 5'7", thinning hair?
You knew him?

48:53.890 --> 48:56.142
Nope. Never seen him before
in my life.

48:56.309 --> 48:59.187
That is a hell of a fish.

49:01.397 --> 49:03.191
Wait a minute.

49:08.363 --> 49:09.739
You left yourself clues?

49:09.906 --> 49:13.993
In case I was deneuralyzed because
my replacement couldn't handle it.

49:14.160 --> 49:18.831
If the joker that had got deneuralyzed
hadn't created the situation...

49:18.998 --> 49:20.333
Boys.

49:22.210 --> 49:25.129
All right.
You pointing at something.

49:27.757 --> 49:29.133
Okay.

49:29.300 --> 49:30.677
Excuse me.

49:32.220 --> 49:33.346
The astronaut.

49:35.390 --> 49:36.557
Jay?

49:37.058 --> 49:39.352
Okay, all right. He's pointing...

49:39.519 --> 49:41.729
He's like... He like...

49:44.232 --> 49:46.067
Who would stack boxes like this?

49:46.234 --> 49:50.071
A box stacker who's not
stacking boxes. He's leaving clues.

49:50.238 --> 49:51.739
It's an arrow.

49:55.868 --> 49:58.121
Jay?
You're slowing me down, slick.

49:58.287 --> 50:01.916
Whatever we're looking for
is in these cabinets, right here.

50:03.334 --> 50:06.421
Anchovy filets in virgin olive oil.

50:09.924 --> 50:12.301
I hope I'm not slowing you down.

50:12.927 --> 50:15.555
Good work, partner. Yeah.

50:15.722 --> 50:18.099
We gotta figure out where it goes.
I know where.

50:18.266 --> 50:23.104
Whoa. No. Not yet.
MiB code 773 clearly says...

50:23.271 --> 50:26.441
I know the code,
but she might be important to me.

50:27.066 --> 50:29.569
To us. Well, for help.
To help us later.

50:30.236 --> 50:32.947
Well, she can't stay here.
They'll be back.

50:35.616 --> 50:39.328
You can stay with friends of mine.
People like you?

50:39.620 --> 50:40.621
Kind of.

50:40.788 --> 50:42.373
Jay!

50:42.540 --> 50:45.001
Low bridge!
What's going on, man?

50:45.168 --> 50:47.295
Hey, what's happening, fellas?
MiB is code 101.

50:49.088 --> 50:50.465
Bad.
Very bad.

50:50.631 --> 50:54.677
- I need your help. This is Laura.
- Laura!

50:54.844 --> 50:56.471
Easy, easy!

50:56.637 --> 50:57.680
They're worms.

50:57.847 --> 50:59.974
Once you go worm,
that's what you'll yearn.

51:00.141 --> 51:01.142
Yaah.

51:01.309 --> 51:04.645
I've dated worse.

51:05.188 --> 51:07.815
They're suspended
for stealing from duty-free shop.

51:07.982 --> 51:10.777
We were framed.
Zed's wormophobic.

51:10.943 --> 51:12.236
- Kay!
- You're back!

51:12.403 --> 51:15.156
They said you were dead.
We're double-parked.

51:15.323 --> 51:17.200
Laura's very important to me.

51:17.909 --> 51:21.496
To us. To the stuff... Me and
you, man, the stuff we're doing.

51:22.663 --> 51:25.666
Keep an eye on her.
I'll keep both on her.

51:25.833 --> 51:26.834
No problem!

51:27.585 --> 51:28.878
Hey, hey, hey.

51:29.045 --> 51:31.839
Why don't you sit here?
Like you got a shot.

51:32.006 --> 51:33.174
Hey, shut up!

51:36.344 --> 51:39.013
My communicator,
in case you need it.

51:40.056 --> 51:42.517
Ooh. Ha-ha.

51:42.683 --> 51:45.061
Nice move.
Okay. Um...

51:45.228 --> 51:46.771
Oh. Uh...

51:46.938 --> 51:50.191
Just watch out for Neeble.
Which one's Neeble?

51:50.358 --> 51:51.776
Um, he's...

51:53.194 --> 51:55.404
Which one of y'all is Neeble?
Yo, mama!

51:55.571 --> 51:59.784
Ah. Him, right there. It's fine.
Everything's straight. It's safe.

51:59.951 --> 52:01.953
Don't fall asleep.

52:03.704 --> 52:05.373
Twister!

52:07.375 --> 52:12.046
Run over your plan one more time.
I'm struggling with it.

52:12.213 --> 52:16.050
You neuralyzed memory of the
Light but left yourself clues.

52:16.217 --> 52:17.260
Right.

52:17.426 --> 52:22.515
Photo pointing to a key in a pizzeria
which opens a locker at Grand Central.

52:22.682 --> 52:25.810
In the locker, we'll find another clue.
That's the plan.

52:25.977 --> 52:27.311
Ah.

52:29.188 --> 52:32.775
I like to keep my enemies confused.
We all confused, Kay.

52:35.069 --> 52:36.612
Are you gonna slow me down?

52:36.779 --> 52:39.407
Your brain's working on old software.

52:39.574 --> 52:41.784
Why don't you go
grab us some coffee?

52:41.951 --> 52:45.454
Sure. How do you take it? Black?
Couple cubes of kiss my ass?

52:45.621 --> 52:49.041
I don't know what's in there,
so step back.

52:49.208 --> 52:52.670
Kay, for real, man.
Open the damn locker.

52:57.258 --> 52:59.635
Kay! He's back! The light giver!

52:59.802 --> 53:02.305
All hail Kay! All hail Kay!

53:06.726 --> 53:09.562
You are the man who would be
king of the train locker.

53:09.729 --> 53:10.771
Praise Kay!

53:10.938 --> 53:15.735
Oh, good and gentle townfolk
of Locker C-18,

53:15.902 --> 53:19.447
did I leave anything here?
Yes. The timekeeper.

53:19.614 --> 53:22.283
Left to illuminate our streets
and hearts.

53:22.450 --> 53:26.954
- I've been looking everywhere for this.
- Merciful one! The clock tower!

53:27.121 --> 53:29.832
I got y'all, it's cool.
Check this out.

53:30.124 --> 53:33.252
Titanium case.
Waterproof to over 300 meters.

53:34.003 --> 53:36.589
That's banging.
Who are you, stranger?

53:37.006 --> 53:38.633
- Jay.
- Hmm.

53:39.050 --> 53:41.260
All hail Jay!
All hail Jay!

53:43.888 --> 53:46.974
Oh, merciful Jay, the keeper of...
Come on.

53:47.475 --> 53:49.644
- Wait! The commandments!
- The tablet!

53:49.810 --> 53:52.855
The tablet! The tablet!
The tablet! The tablet!

53:53.022 --> 53:57.068
We have lived by its word, and
peace has reigned throughout our world.

53:57.235 --> 54:00.655
Pass it on to others! So that they too
may be enlightened!

54:00.821 --> 54:02.490
Be kind! Rewind!

54:02.657 --> 54:04.492
Reconcile your past,

54:04.909 --> 54:07.328
in order to move tranquilly
into your future!

54:07.495 --> 54:09.830
Two for one every Wednesday.

54:09.997 --> 54:13.376
Give twice as much as ye receive
on our most sacred of days.

54:13.668 --> 54:14.710
Every Wednesday.

54:14.877 --> 54:18.005
Large adult entertainment
section in the back.

54:22.093 --> 54:23.678
That's just nasty.

54:24.512 --> 54:26.764
What's with the video card?
Don't know.

54:26.931 --> 54:28.432
The watch?
A reminder.

54:28.599 --> 54:29.976
Of what?
Can't remember.

54:30.142 --> 54:31.185
Guess.

54:31.352 --> 54:35.106
I guess we have till midnight,
that's 59 minutes to figure it out.

54:37.525 --> 54:41.654
Look. Here's an idea. Let's
stop chasing butt-backwards clues,

54:41.821 --> 54:45.992
get a couple fission carbonizers
and get our headquarters back.

54:46.158 --> 54:48.327
It's all about to make sense, kid.

54:48.494 --> 54:50.246
Is this card valid?

54:51.872 --> 54:55.710
- This card hasn't been used in years.
- I've been away on business.

54:55.876 --> 54:58.212
- Billions of frequent flier miles.
- Try and use them.

54:58.379 --> 55:02.425
I wanted to go to Cambodia. You can
get a lobster dinner for a dollar.

55:02.800 --> 55:08.139
The airlines black out holidays.
It's a conspiracy, I'm sure, I mean...

55:08.306 --> 55:11.017
Can you tell us anything
about the account?

55:11.392 --> 55:13.352
You never checked out a tape.

55:13.519 --> 55:16.272
You reserved one once,
but you never picked it up.

55:17.732 --> 55:19.817
Newton.
There's a rat in the toilet.

55:19.984 --> 55:24.238
It's all stopped up. You're
gonna have to pee in the sin...

55:27.450 --> 55:30.411
Still think I'm paranoid?
Yeah.

55:31.203 --> 55:36.667
Gentlemen, my name is Newton. I run the place.
Seen any aliens lately?

55:36.834 --> 55:41.088
You need professional help.
He's getting it. It's not working.

55:41.255 --> 55:43.466
Okay, so, new case, huh?

55:43.632 --> 55:46.093
Episode 27, Light of Zartha.

55:47.595 --> 55:48.929
Got it.

55:49.555 --> 55:53.309
Jarra, it's a sin they've kept
a genius like you locked away.

55:53.476 --> 55:57.438
Their agent Jay caught me siphoning
ozone to sell on the black market.

55:57.605 --> 55:59.565
They're touchy
about global warming.

55:59.732 --> 56:03.277
I need a spacecraft that can travel
300 times the speed of light.

56:03.444 --> 56:05.446
I'll give you
whatever you want.

56:05.613 --> 56:08.115
Give me Jay. We'll call it even.
Groovy.

56:08.908 --> 56:11.369
You've got till midnight.

56:15.539 --> 56:19.126
Gatbot, I got a little
something special for you.

56:23.631 --> 56:26.425
Newton? Newton, is that you?

56:26.592 --> 56:29.095
Yes, Mom, I'm up here
with some friends.

56:29.261 --> 56:30.846
I wanna have your baby.

56:31.013 --> 56:33.140
Would you like some mini-pizza?

56:34.058 --> 56:37.144
You guys want some mini-pizzas?
They're good.

56:37.311 --> 56:40.523
They're like mini-bagels,
with pizza stuff on them.

56:40.689 --> 56:43.484
She'll put
a little fontina cheese on.

56:43.651 --> 56:47.655
She has palsy, so she ends
up putting a lot of cheese on.

56:52.284 --> 56:54.412
No, thanks, we're cool.

56:54.578 --> 56:55.830
All right.

56:57.581 --> 56:58.958
Over here.

57:03.629 --> 57:05.089
- This is it.
- Hm.

57:05.256 --> 57:07.550
Finally some hard evidence.

57:07.800 --> 57:11.512
Gentlemen, before I play the tape,
one question:

57:12.096 --> 57:13.848
What's up with anal probing?

57:14.014 --> 57:17.935
Aliens travel billions of light
years just to check out our...

57:18.102 --> 57:20.354
Boy, move.

57:20.521 --> 57:23.441
Okay. Just a question.

57:24.483 --> 57:28.028
<i>Here is one of
their stories that "never happened"</i>

57:28.195 --> 57:31.449
<i>from one of their files
that doesn't exist.</i>

57:33.492 --> 57:38.497
<i>1978. Devastating war of Zartha
had raged on for 50 years.</i>

57:38.664 --> 57:40.416
Hm, looks like Spielberg's work.

57:40.583 --> 57:44.503
<i>But the Zarthans had
a great treasure, the Light of Zartha.</i>

57:44.670 --> 57:48.048
<i>A source of
power so awesome, it alone</i>

57:48.215 --> 57:51.802
<i>could mean victory and restoration
for the Zarthans</i>

57:51.969 --> 57:56.390
<i>or complete annihilation, if it
fell into the hands of the Kylothians.</i>

57:56.557 --> 57:58.726
<i>A group of Zarthans
made the journey,</i>

57:58.893 --> 58:00.686
<i>led by the Keeper of the Light...</i>

58:00.853 --> 58:02.313
Lauranna.

58:02.730 --> 58:04.857
<i>Princess Lauranna.</i>

58:05.149 --> 58:09.737
<i>Lauranna beseeched the Men in Black
to help her hide the Light on Earth.</i>

58:09.904 --> 58:12.239
<i>But they could not intervene.</i>

58:12.406 --> 58:13.657
No.

58:14.366 --> 58:15.493
It was night.

58:17.703 --> 58:19.121
And it was raining.

58:19.747 --> 58:21.207
<i>You've been very wise.</i>

58:21.373 --> 58:25.920
<i>Kay, please. If Serleena takes
the Light, it's the end of our world.</i>

58:26.587 --> 58:29.924
<i>If we extend protection
for the Light beyond Earth,</i>

58:30.090 --> 58:33.427
<i>we put Earth in jeopardy.
We must remain neutral.</i>

58:33.594 --> 58:36.180
- Where is it?
- We're neutral, remember?

58:36.388 --> 58:38.599
If you want it, go get it.

58:42.811 --> 58:44.313
No!

59:13.467 --> 59:15.761
<i>And so never knowing it happened,</i>

59:15.928 --> 59:18.847
<i>the people of Earth
were once again saved</i>

59:19.014 --> 59:21.141
<i>by a secret society of protectors...</i>

59:23.269 --> 59:24.937
I shouldn't have.

59:25.896 --> 59:28.315
You never sent it off the planet.

59:29.441 --> 59:30.859
You hid it here.

59:32.861 --> 59:34.280
The worm guys.

59:38.450 --> 59:41.245
Are you one of Newton's
friends from therapy?

59:41.412 --> 59:43.289
Yes, ma'am, I am.
Look here, please.

59:43.455 --> 59:44.623
Would you like some mini-pizz...?

59:46.792 --> 59:47.835
A neuralyz...

59:49.587 --> 59:53.173
Okay, first, get some contact lenses.

59:53.340 --> 59:55.634
Joints look like they pick up cable.

59:55.801 --> 01:00:00.389
Second, take her to Cambodia. Get
her lobster. Pay more than a dollar.

01:00:00.556 --> 01:00:03.851
Third, the second y'all get back
from Cambodia,

01:00:04.018 --> 01:00:07.062
move your bum ass
out of your mom's house.

01:00:07.229 --> 01:00:09.648
- Let's go.
- Boy, you like 40 years old.

01:00:09.815 --> 01:00:12.109
Agent Jay?
All right, all right.

01:00:12.276 --> 01:00:16.280
Oh. And there ain't no such thing
as aliens or Men in Black.

01:00:22.494 --> 01:00:25.706
You wanna go to Cambodia?
Yeah.

01:00:27.833 --> 01:00:29.209
Hey, Mom?

01:00:29.835 --> 01:00:31.462
Communicator, Jay.

01:00:32.838 --> 01:00:35.591
Laura, it's me.
Jay, we're playing Twister.

01:00:35.758 --> 01:00:37.551
What's up, Jay?

01:00:37.718 --> 01:00:41.013
Quit touching my butt!
I thought it was your face.

01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:44.224
They're good at this.
They don't have spines.

01:00:44.391 --> 01:00:47.353
Oh. They were telling me about
Oprah, from Chicago.

01:00:47.519 --> 01:00:51.065
Maybe landed in Chicago. Ha-ha-ha.

01:00:51.398 --> 01:00:53.901
- Are you wearing a bracelet?
- Yeah.

01:00:54.068 --> 01:00:55.152
Is it glowing?

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:03.243
It's never done that before.
We're on our way.

01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:04.953
Communicator, Frank.

01:01:05.245 --> 01:01:07.748
<i>Frank, get down to Level C.
Deactivate lockdown.</i>

01:01:07.915 --> 01:01:10.793
<i>We're headed to the worm guys.
We found the Light.</i>

01:01:10.959 --> 01:01:12.378
Got it, Jay.

01:01:12.544 --> 01:01:13.712
Scrad?

01:01:13.879 --> 01:01:15.005
Bitch.

01:01:15.172 --> 01:01:17.091
Why didn't you say I love you?

01:01:17.257 --> 01:01:21.887
He's a dog. I don't even like him.
No, the girl. You're sweet on her.

01:01:22.054 --> 01:01:25.224
That's why you didn't neuralyze her.
You got emotionally involved.

01:01:25.391 --> 01:01:29.895
Like you did with Lauranna?
I put the entire planet in danger.

01:01:30.062 --> 01:01:33.315
I don't want to see you
making my mistakes.

01:01:33.482 --> 01:01:35.067
Whatever, man.

01:01:39.446 --> 01:01:40.656
Laura?

01:01:44.952 --> 01:01:46.286
Oi.

01:01:47.621 --> 01:01:48.664
Damn!

01:01:53.544 --> 01:01:55.045
Never stood half a chance.

01:01:56.296 --> 01:01:57.381
Oh, boy.

01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:59.758
Unh. That's gonna leave a scar.

01:02:01.927 --> 01:02:02.970
Where's Laura?

01:02:03.137 --> 01:02:05.472
MiB headquarters.
Some dumb two-headed guy.

01:02:05.639 --> 01:02:07.057
They got the bracelet.

01:02:07.224 --> 01:02:09.977
We got 39 minutes.
You guys, um,

01:02:10.144 --> 01:02:12.312
pull yourselves together.

01:02:13.063 --> 01:02:14.148
Damn.

01:02:15.524 --> 01:02:17.609
Oh, that's feeling better.

01:02:17.776 --> 01:02:20.487
- Hey, guys, wait up!
- Let me grab my drink!

01:02:20.654 --> 01:02:22.698
Serleena has the bracelet.
Why take Laura?

01:02:22.865 --> 01:02:24.032
She also wants me.

01:02:24.199 --> 01:02:27.494
What's the book say?
We're off book. I say split some wigs.

01:02:27.661 --> 01:02:29.913
We need wig-splitting weapons.
Got them.

01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:38.505
<i>Ah. Paw Paw's coming to visit me.
Hello, Paw Paw.</i>

01:02:38.672 --> 01:02:41.675
<i>Paw Paw and ZuZu love to see
what's going on in the garden.</i>

01:02:41.842 --> 01:02:46.263
Don't worry, folks. I used to live
here. Came to pick up a few things.

01:02:50.309 --> 01:02:51.810
Nice place.

01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:55.522
Hoo-ah.

01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:57.858
Hoo-eeh.

01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:01.195
Yah!

01:03:04.281 --> 01:03:05.532
See you.

01:03:15.375 --> 01:03:18.170
You did not see a room
full of weapons or four aliens.

01:03:18.337 --> 01:03:21.048
You will cherish and love each
other for the rest of your lives.

01:03:21.215 --> 01:03:25.219
Which could be the next 28 minutes,
so get to loving and cherishing.

01:03:25.385 --> 01:03:28.055
Oh. And she can stay up
as late as she want

01:03:28.222 --> 01:03:30.849
and have cookies
and candy and stuff.

01:03:41.735 --> 01:03:43.904
<i>Four minutes to launch.</i>

01:03:44.071 --> 01:03:46.031
<i>Four minutes to launch.</i>

01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:50.744
<i>Your ship is ready.</i>
Good. Send it to Kyloth now.

01:03:54.122 --> 01:03:55.374
Ready, guys?

01:03:55.541 --> 01:03:57.751
Lock and load, baby.

01:03:57.918 --> 01:03:59.586
You ready, kid?
Kid?

01:03:59.753 --> 01:04:02.756
I saved the world
from a Kreelon invasion.

01:04:02.923 --> 01:04:07.094
They're the Backstreet Boys of the universe.
They throw snowballs?

01:04:07.886 --> 01:04:09.346
Know what you're doing?

01:04:09.513 --> 01:04:12.516
I'm about to attack one
of the most feared aliens

01:04:12.683 --> 01:04:15.936
with four worms and a mailman.
Let's make it hot.

01:04:16.103 --> 01:04:17.396
No, no, wait!

01:04:23.151 --> 01:04:25.445
A code 101 lockdown!

01:04:25.612 --> 01:04:29.658
The building gets pressurized.
Nothing in, nothing out. I knew that.

01:04:29.825 --> 01:04:31.869
Yeah, you knew.
Front and center, worms!

01:04:32.035 --> 01:04:33.328
You got it.

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:45.465
It's about time you guys got here.
That lady is causing all kinds of hell.

01:05:05.819 --> 01:05:09.072
Yummy. Someone I need to eat.

01:05:09.281 --> 01:05:12.951
Get to the launch pad. The bracelet
shows the departure point.

01:05:13.118 --> 01:05:15.370
Do not come back for me.
What do you mean?

01:05:15.537 --> 01:05:18.248
Do not come back for me.

01:05:22.502 --> 01:05:24.671
Worm guys,
give me some cover fire.

01:05:24.838 --> 01:05:26.590
Too scared, can't move.

01:05:36.266 --> 01:05:37.476
Go!

01:05:48.195 --> 01:05:51.114
Limber.
Go to subcontrol panel 7-R-Delta.

01:05:51.281 --> 01:05:56.787
Shut off power so they can't take off.
Can't. Too scared.

01:05:57.746 --> 01:06:00.374
Oh, that way.
Away from the bullets.

01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:02.167
No problem. Hoo-ah.

01:06:04.169 --> 01:06:05.587
Alley-oop.

01:06:16.807 --> 01:06:18.725
Nice to see you again, Kay.

01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:25.023
<i>3 minutes to launch.</i>
Jay!

01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:27.401
<i>Three minutes to launch.</i>

01:06:27.901 --> 01:06:29.361
Hello, Jay. Long time.

01:06:29.528 --> 01:06:32.030
Jarra! What's up, man?
You look great.

01:06:32.197 --> 01:06:34.825
What's it been? Five years?
And 42 days.

01:06:34.992 --> 01:06:37.494
You count every one
when you're locked away.

01:06:37.661 --> 01:06:41.748
You shouldn't have tried to steal
our ozone. Be there in one minute.

01:06:42.874 --> 01:06:45.460
Over our dead titanium bodies!

01:06:45.627 --> 01:06:47.087
Two minutes.

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:55.595
Uh, let's play this one by ear.

01:06:58.390 --> 01:07:02.602
I should have vaporized you before.
You really did love Lauranna.

01:07:02.769 --> 01:07:04.646
Didn't you, Kay?

01:07:04.938 --> 01:07:06.982
You silly little man.

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:28.045
Unh! Aah!
Ha-ha.

01:07:30.589 --> 01:07:33.884
Ow! Aah!

01:07:35.218 --> 01:07:37.304
<i>Two minutes to launch.</i>

01:07:39.222 --> 01:07:40.640
Just go, I'll be fine!

01:07:41.475 --> 01:07:43.977
What you talking about?
I'm winning.

01:07:44.144 --> 01:07:48.148
Jarra, you are under arrest
for being that ugly,

01:07:48.315 --> 01:07:51.151
and for making that many copies.
Surrender!

01:07:51.318 --> 01:07:52.360
I want him in pieces.

01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:55.655
Aah! Whoo!

01:07:55.864 --> 01:07:58.200
Jarra Jr. is going, going,

01:07:58.867 --> 01:08:00.660
gone!

01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:15.092
- Rectum.
- Damn near killed him!

01:08:16.468 --> 01:08:17.844
Never get tired of that one.

01:08:18.011 --> 01:08:19.429
Where do we shut off the power?

01:08:19.595 --> 01:08:20.680
I don't know.

01:08:26.685 --> 01:08:30.607
- I'm fine. I'll be there in a minute.
- No, he won't.

01:08:35.821 --> 01:08:38.156
Uh-huh. Down to one now, Jarra!

01:08:48.416 --> 01:08:50.794
<i>Thirty seconds to launch.</i>

01:08:58.885 --> 01:09:01.263
<i>Fifteen seconds to launch.</i>

01:09:04.182 --> 01:09:06.309
<i>Ten seconds to launch.</i>

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:07.853
<i>Eight.</i>

01:09:08.019 --> 01:09:09.354
<i>Seven.</i>

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:10.897
<i>Six.</i>

01:09:11.064 --> 01:09:12.399
<i>Five.</i>

01:09:12.566 --> 01:09:13.692
<i>Four.</i>

01:09:13.859 --> 01:09:15.861
<i>Three. Two.</i>

01:09:17.737 --> 01:09:19.698
<i>Launch terminated.</i>

01:09:20.157 --> 01:09:23.618
What did you mean, leave you?
Well, he took your gun.

01:09:23.785 --> 01:09:26.621
Cracked your head.
Slammed you across the room.

01:09:26.787 --> 01:09:30.876
Half the time you were on your back.
Look, that's how I fight.

01:09:31.585 --> 01:09:34.045
You've lost, you insignificant speck.

01:09:34.212 --> 01:09:37.256
You've wasted 25 years
of my time, and for what?

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:41.553
The total annihilation of Zartha.
All because you went mushy.

01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:45.932
I'll give you one last chance to
surrender, you slimy invertebrate.

01:09:46.099 --> 01:09:49.685
What are you gonna do to stop me?
Not me. Him.

01:09:51.729 --> 01:09:54.024
Your flight's been canceled.

01:10:00.739 --> 01:10:05.160
Shut down power. Shut down power.
Buttons, buttons. I'm guessing, uh...

01:10:05.327 --> 01:10:06.453
Yeah.

01:10:08.538 --> 01:10:10.790
- Worms!
- Sorry.

01:10:15.879 --> 01:10:18.548
Give me the bracelet.
I'm going with you.

01:10:18.715 --> 01:10:21.426
Everybody in the car.
Everybody.

01:10:34.606 --> 01:10:37.484
This bracelet is what
everybody's been after?

01:10:37.651 --> 01:10:39.361
It's often something small.

01:10:39.527 --> 01:10:42.489
It's not the Light.
It tells us the departure point.

01:10:42.656 --> 01:10:45.575
What?
If we don't get there in 11 minutes,

01:10:45.742 --> 01:10:48.828
that bracelet will go nuclear
and destroy Earth.

01:10:48.995 --> 01:10:50.455
What?!

01:10:51.039 --> 01:10:52.666
Hello.
Oh.

01:10:53.083 --> 01:10:55.168
Wait, Kay, no.
I know what I'm doing.

01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:11.142
Damn.

01:11:12.811 --> 01:11:16.022
Modified to hyper-speed!
Seat belts.

01:11:19.401 --> 01:11:20.443
What's that?

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:23.363
At hyper-speed, you have
to use the navigational stalk.

01:11:28.285 --> 01:11:32.539
Toggle switches for the ailerons
. Joysticks for the stabilizer and rudder.

01:11:32.706 --> 01:11:34.124
Okay.

01:11:37.585 --> 01:11:38.670
I just want you to know...

01:11:40.046 --> 01:11:41.881
Hold on to that for one second.

01:11:45.468 --> 01:11:47.137
Computer, worms.

01:11:47.304 --> 01:11:50.471
I said, "Bitch, if you
don't want me to kick your

01:11:50.472 --> 01:11:54.019
skinny Zone Diet ass, turn
around and exit the planet."

01:11:54.185 --> 01:11:56.354
<i>Frank, where are you?</i>

01:11:56.521 --> 01:11:57.981
Main hall, egg display.

01:11:58.148 --> 01:12:01.026
We're taking fire.
Kay pushed the red button.

01:12:01.192 --> 01:12:04.112
Computer at MiB can destroy
bogey. I'll walk you through it.

01:12:07.449 --> 01:12:11.995
Jay? Frank. You were the best darn
partner a Remoolian could ever have.

01:12:12.787 --> 01:12:14.080
Godspeed.

01:12:15.749 --> 01:12:20.253
Frank? Frank?
Okay, here we go, automatic pilot.

01:12:22.505 --> 01:12:25.842
It is not automatic piloting.
He doesn't operate at hyper-speed.

01:12:26.009 --> 01:12:30.263
I could use a steering wheel here!
This is what we got.

01:12:32.057 --> 01:12:34.976
Didn't you ever have a Game Boy?
What is a Game Boy?

01:12:35.143 --> 01:12:37.437
You know what? Move. Move.
Okay.

01:12:38.021 --> 01:12:40.357
Oh! Hey, that is not
the navigational stalk!

01:12:52.327 --> 01:12:54.329
Okay, straight down.

01:12:59.042 --> 01:13:00.460
Idiots.

01:13:10.512 --> 01:13:11.805
Subway may not be the best place

01:13:11.971 --> 01:13:13.264
to lose her.
Shh.

01:13:15.683 --> 01:13:17.143
Where is he?
He?

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:18.853
Jeff. Hang on!

01:13:21.147 --> 01:13:22.524
Oops.

01:13:23.358 --> 01:13:24.484
Teeth.

01:13:58.435 --> 01:14:01.438
Running out of time, Kay.
Where is the Light?

01:14:02.647 --> 01:14:04.149
Right here.

01:14:05.150 --> 01:14:07.360
What?
What, I'm the Light?

01:14:08.278 --> 01:14:10.864
No. No way.
You have a planet to save.

01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:13.533
You're mistaken. I work at a pizzeria.

01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:17.662
Two days ago, I was running a post
office. You are who you are.

01:14:17.829 --> 01:14:20.915
Laura, you are the Light.

01:14:21.082 --> 01:14:24.836
The leader of your people.
Their spirit and their hope.

01:14:25.003 --> 01:14:27.714
The power is within you
to save a planet.

01:14:27.881 --> 01:14:32.177
I protected you until it was
your time. Your time is now.

01:14:36.639 --> 01:14:40.393
You will save a world. You
know things before they happen.

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:42.687
I'm a Libra.
You're Zarthan.

01:14:42.854 --> 01:14:47.066
When you get sad, it rains.
Lots of people get sad when it rains.

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:50.069
It rains because you're sad, baby.

01:15:43.289 --> 01:15:44.916
It's not fair.

01:15:50.797 --> 01:15:52.465
Never is.

01:15:54.217 --> 01:15:55.843
We are who we are,

01:15:56.010 --> 01:15:58.513
even if we sometimes forget.

01:16:07.939 --> 01:16:10.483
Jeff, I am so not
in the mood for you!

01:16:10.650 --> 01:16:12.402
Get back in the subway!
Now!

01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:20.201
That's not good.

01:16:22.078 --> 01:16:24.747
Wait! No! Aah!

01:16:25.039 --> 01:16:26.374
Jay!

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:31.421
I cannot emphasize enough how much
we need you on that transport.

01:16:32.839 --> 01:16:35.133
Laura! You have to go!

01:16:35.550 --> 01:16:36.926
Oh, jeez.

01:16:38.970 --> 01:16:41.764
Go. He's fine.
He does this all the time.

01:16:42.849 --> 01:16:44.100
Nope!

01:16:46.477 --> 01:16:49.355
About to lay the smackdown
on your candy ass.

01:16:49.772 --> 01:16:52.108
Laura! It's your destiny!

01:16:52.358 --> 01:16:54.277
I was talking, Kay! Aah!

01:16:55.778 --> 01:16:57.947
Hey! No biting.

01:16:59.699 --> 01:17:02.076
If you don't go, we all die.

01:17:05.288 --> 01:17:07.874
You're just as beautiful
as your mother.

01:17:14.547 --> 01:17:16.382
Kay? A little help?

01:17:29.228 --> 01:17:30.355
Kay?

01:17:32.190 --> 01:17:34.734
Might I suggest a bigger gun?

01:18:01.260 --> 01:18:02.845
Kid?
Yeah.

01:18:03.304 --> 01:18:06.641
Thanks for bringing me back.
No problem.

01:18:07.266 --> 01:18:08.768
Why didn't you tell me?

01:18:08.935 --> 01:18:11.062
Would you have let her go?

01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:36.379
So, what's it like on the outside?
Not doing this every day?

01:18:36.546 --> 01:18:37.964
It's nice.

01:18:38.131 --> 01:18:41.968
Sleep late on the weekends.
Watch the Weather Channel.

01:18:45.471 --> 01:18:47.598
I did miss this city.

01:18:48.808 --> 01:18:52.353
So Laura is Princess
Lauranna's daughter.

01:18:54.272 --> 01:18:57.650
Did y'all...?
MiB is a mess. Let's go, kid.

01:18:58.443 --> 01:18:59.652
Let's go?

01:18:59.819 --> 01:19:04.115
Thousands of people in New York
and New Jersey saw our little event.

01:19:04.282 --> 01:19:08.661
Plan needs to be thought out. Plan
needs to be cool. What you...?

01:19:13.332 --> 01:19:15.293
Kid, I'll get you trained yet.

01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:17.003
I want one of those.

01:19:17.170 --> 01:19:18.421
Damn!

01:19:23.259 --> 01:19:24.469
Hey
Hey.

01:19:24.635 --> 01:19:27.054
How you doing?
I'm good, man.

01:19:27.221 --> 01:19:31.768
We've all been there. The girl is
gone and it hurts. Wanna talk'?

01:19:31.934 --> 01:19:33.478
No.
I can help.

01:19:33.644 --> 01:19:34.687
No.

01:19:34.854 --> 01:19:35.855
Still sulking?

01:19:36.022 --> 01:19:37.064
No.
Yeah.

01:19:37.231 --> 01:19:41.486
Hell, you miss her. It happens to all of us.
I knew this hot young thing.

01:19:41.652 --> 01:19:45.239
When our bodies were in the
positions of the Kamasutra...

01:19:45.406 --> 01:19:46.949
Zed!
Ah...

01:19:47.158 --> 01:19:49.035
Come on, man! Damn!

01:19:49.410 --> 01:19:54.040
I'll tell you about dames. They say they want
to be scratched, but they really want is:

01:19:55.541 --> 01:19:56.709
Hey! Frank.

01:19:56.876 --> 01:19:59.587
What? Still sitting shiva?
Want my advice?

01:19:59.754 --> 01:20:01.672
No. No advice.

01:20:01.839 --> 01:20:03.382
No talking.

01:20:04.008 --> 01:20:05.301
Hell, no.

01:20:05.468 --> 01:20:08.137
Fellas, I swear, I'm fine.

01:20:09.096 --> 01:20:11.891
All hail Jay! All hail Jay!

01:20:12.433 --> 01:20:14.227
I brought them
from Grand Central.

01:20:14.393 --> 01:20:16.062
Why put them in my locker?

01:20:16.229 --> 01:20:18.564
I thought it would put things
in perspective.

01:20:18.731 --> 01:20:21.400
It's kind of sad.
We need to let them out.

01:20:21.567 --> 01:20:23.778
They need to know the world
is bigger than that.

01:20:25.112 --> 01:20:26.447
Still a rookie.

01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:31.077
Whoa.
