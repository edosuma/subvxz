00:03.637 --> 00:05.004
(theme music playing)

00:08.476 --> 00:11.510

00:11.512 --> 00:14.279

00:14.281 --> 00:19.284

00:49.183 --> 00:51.650
Challenge of the Brave?
Looks like some kind
of tournament.

00:51.652 --> 00:54.219
(chuckles)
Not just any tournament.

00:54.221 --> 00:56.355
I hear the fiercest fighters
from all over are coming

00:56.357 --> 00:58.223
-to compete!
-Whoa!

00:58.225 --> 01:00.392
Let me tell you,
whoever walks away champ

01:00.394 --> 01:02.394
will have earned
the respect of every warrior

01:02.396 --> 01:04.229
in the seven kingdoms.

01:17.545 --> 01:19.244
Ugh!

01:34.628 --> 01:36.428
(sighs)

01:41.569 --> 01:43.602
Oh! Stop! Thief!

01:44.638 --> 01:47.506
Stay back! We'll handle it.

01:57.585 --> 01:58.650
Ha!

02:01.589 --> 02:05.290
-(owl hoots)
-Whoa! It's Princess Rapunzel!

02:05.292 --> 02:06.458
-Huh?
-Huh?

02:06.460 --> 02:08.594
(kids cheering)

02:08.596 --> 02:10.496
(grunts, laughs)

02:10.498 --> 02:12.264
(hoots)

02:12.266 --> 02:14.633
Wow, Cass.
What is all this?

02:14.635 --> 02:18.270
Nothing. I'm warming up
for the Challenge of the Brave
this morning.

02:18.272 --> 02:22.608
It's just a competition
to find the toughest warrior
in all of Corona. No big deal.

02:22.610 --> 02:25.410
Ooh! Sounds exciting.
Where can I sign up?

02:25.412 --> 02:28.280
Yeah, like I said, no big--
Oh, sorry, what?

02:28.282 --> 02:30.482
-I wanna sign up!
-You mean compete?

02:30.484 --> 02:32.251
Let's do it together!

02:32.253 --> 02:33.318
-Yeah, do it!
-That would be great!

02:33.320 --> 02:34.453
-Do it!
-You could be princess,

02:34.455 --> 02:36.421
and the most
"reveredest" warrior!

02:36.423 --> 02:38.323
Aw. (laughs)

02:38.325 --> 02:42.628
That would be fun.
But I'm not so sure
that's the best idea.

02:42.630 --> 02:46.331
I'm brave. And I'm always
up for a challenge.

02:46.333 --> 02:49.668
But the-- the thing
is, the challenge is
by invitation only,

02:49.670 --> 02:51.336
so you can't do it.

02:51.338 --> 02:54.506
Oh, man, ugh!
Rules are rules.

02:55.442 --> 02:58.610
-(hoots)
-Oh. Okay.

02:58.612 --> 03:01.580
But you can always count on me
to cheer you on.

03:04.618 --> 03:07.386
Announcer:
Welcome to the Challenge
of the Brave,

03:07.388 --> 03:09.388
where you will see
skilled combatants

03:09.390 --> 03:11.523
from all the lands
compete in a series

03:11.525 --> 03:15.661
of death-defying
challenges that culminate
in the main event!

03:15.663 --> 03:17.629
The ultimate melee!

03:17.631 --> 03:19.731
Only one will walk away
with the respect

03:19.733 --> 03:21.700
of the seven kingdoms!

03:21.702 --> 03:25.470
Today's favorite is the world's
most renowned warrior.

03:25.472 --> 03:30.475
Some say he's the meanest,
most ruthless fighter the world
has even seen!

03:30.477 --> 03:32.344
Wreck Marauder!

03:32.346 --> 03:34.413
(crowd cheering)

03:34.415 --> 03:35.714
(bees buzzing)

03:35.716 --> 03:36.782
(screaming)

03:39.653 --> 03:41.453
(screams, grunts)

03:42.389 --> 03:43.488
(whimpers)

03:44.825 --> 03:47.459
-Boo! (cackles)
-(screaming)

03:49.396 --> 03:50.495
(crowd gasps)

03:50.497 --> 03:55.500
Whose house is this?
This is Wreck's house!

03:55.502 --> 03:56.835
(growls)

03:59.740 --> 04:01.406
(crowd groans)

04:01.408 --> 04:03.742
Yeah! That's my boy right there!

04:03.744 --> 04:06.378
Wreck Marauder!

04:06.380 --> 04:08.614
I have seen that guy fight
all over the world.

04:08.616 --> 04:09.715
He's undefeated!

04:09.717 --> 04:12.684
¶ Challenge of the Brave ¶

04:12.686 --> 04:15.721
-¶ Challenge of the Brave ¶
-(chittering)

04:15.723 --> 04:17.723
Everybody, come on!

04:17.725 --> 04:20.525
All right,
the beard of bees lady!

04:20.527 --> 04:21.827
(bees buzzing)

04:25.699 --> 04:27.733
Oh, yeah!

04:27.735 --> 04:29.368
How about these seats, huh?

04:29.370 --> 04:31.537
If I were any closer
to the action,

04:31.538 --> 04:33.705
they'd be scraping my face off
of Wreck Marauder's knuckles!

04:35.643 --> 04:38.510
(horn blaring)

04:40.614 --> 04:44.783
Uh, sir? Some of the competitors
are requesting we move you
to a new seat.

04:44.785 --> 04:50.422
Oh, you see that?
Moving this super fan
to the super fan section.

04:50.424 --> 04:51.890
Ha! I wish I could say
this has been fun,

04:51.892 --> 04:55.527
but I respect you all
too much to lie
to your faces.

05:03.370 --> 05:06.772
She's just here 'cause she's
Rapunzel's lady in waitin'.

05:06.774 --> 05:08.740
(laughing)

05:09.777 --> 05:12.444
Hi! Hello! Good morning!
How are you?

05:12.446 --> 05:15.814
Ooh! Wow! Your teeth
are so sharp!

05:15.816 --> 05:17.616
(gasps)
Hook Foot!

05:17.618 --> 05:19.584
Why so mad?
Just do a dance,

05:19.586 --> 05:21.853
and give that smile
a second chance.

05:21.855 --> 05:23.588
(laughs)

05:23.590 --> 05:26.591
Probably not the best place
for hugs, Raps.

05:26.593 --> 05:27.926
What are you doing
down here?

05:27.928 --> 05:29.761
This is for competitors only.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.496
I came to wish you luck!

05:31.498 --> 05:33.465
Thanks, but I don't need luck.

05:33.467 --> 05:36.435
I need to use
this time to get inside
the competition's head.

05:36.437 --> 05:38.603
You know, psyche 'em out
with some trash talk.

05:38.605 --> 05:39.638
Trash talk?

05:39.640 --> 05:41.807
Like talk about garbage,
literally?

05:41.809 --> 05:44.776
What? No,
that's not even close.

05:44.778 --> 05:45.844
(sighs)

05:45.846 --> 05:47.579
Watch this.

05:50.851 --> 05:53.618
Hey, you!
You do realize
when they put the call up

05:53.620 --> 05:56.521
for the strongest warriors,
they weren't talking
about breath.

05:56.523 --> 05:57.689
Right?

05:57.691 --> 05:59.691
(belches)

05:59.693 --> 06:01.560
(gags)

06:01.562 --> 06:05.530
Why don't you go back
to the castle, lady-in-waiting?

06:05.532 --> 06:07.799
-(guffaws)
-Well, that wasn't
very nice, Cass.

06:07.801 --> 06:09.668
Yeah. That's the point.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.937
All right.
I'll give it a shot.
I guess.

06:15.542 --> 06:18.810
Excuse me, you?
Yeah, you. Uh-huh.

06:18.812 --> 06:20.645
Prepare to be talked trash to.

06:20.647 --> 06:24.750
Look at you with those...
decorative tattoos.

06:24.752 --> 06:26.651
Oh, wow.

06:26.653 --> 06:28.987
Sorry. I'm sorry,
but those are amazing.

06:28.989 --> 06:31.923
And did you see the lettering
on "Skull Kickr"? Wow.

06:31.925 --> 06:34.826
What about it?

06:34.828 --> 06:37.829
Ah. It's lovely.

06:37.831 --> 06:40.832
Yeah, well, it--
it was my mother's name.

06:40.834 --> 06:43.802
Your mom is really special
to you, isn't she?

06:45.839 --> 06:47.839
Well, I think she'd
be really proud

06:47.841 --> 06:50.842
of the menacing goon
you've become.

06:50.844 --> 06:53.912
(crying) I'm gonna go
see my mom!

06:56.583 --> 06:58.884
(growling)

06:58.886 --> 07:01.586
Whoa! Look at you!

07:01.588 --> 07:03.855
You're a big guy,
aren't you?

07:03.857 --> 07:05.857
Come on, Rapunzel.

07:05.859 --> 07:07.759
What do we have here?

07:07.761 --> 07:11.930
No one told me
they were letting
table scraps compete.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.965
-(laughs)
-Scraps? You're the one
that's gonna walk out of this

07:13.967 --> 07:15.600
in pieces.

07:15.602 --> 07:19.971
I look forward
to makin' everyone
who ever loved you

07:19.973 --> 07:22.040
cry their eyes out.

07:22.042 --> 07:26.611
-(chuckles)
-Whoa! Listen, mister,
trash talk is one thing,

07:26.613 --> 07:27.879
but that was just mean.

07:27.881 --> 07:30.949
-Rapunzel...
-Uh, Cassandra has feelings,

07:30.951 --> 07:34.820
-you know?
-Aw, poor little baby.

07:34.822 --> 07:38.623
-(chuckles)
-And another thing,
you should be--

07:38.625 --> 07:42.861
-Okay. That'll do, Rapunzel.
-(guffawing)

07:44.631 --> 07:50.769
Listen. I have to warm up,
so why don't you find Eugene
in the stands?

07:50.771 --> 07:52.904
You can cheer me on from there.

07:52.906 --> 07:54.906
Way back there.

07:54.908 --> 07:56.808
Yeah. Yeah, sure, okay.

07:56.810 --> 07:57.909
I got it. I got it.

07:57.911 --> 08:00.812
You need to focus.
No distractions.

08:02.015 --> 08:06.618
-Oh! Sorry.
I forgot a good luck hug!
-(grunts)

08:06.620 --> 08:10.088
Oh, right.
It's not a place
for hugging, I'm sorry.

08:10.090 --> 08:11.790
Good luck!

08:11.792 --> 08:14.860
(guffawing)

08:21.835 --> 08:24.002
Ladies and gentlemen,
take your seats!

08:24.004 --> 08:26.838
It's time to meet
today's contestants!

08:26.840 --> 08:31.877
Give it up
for Razorblade McDoom!

08:31.879 --> 08:33.945
(growling)

08:33.947 --> 08:35.881
The Razor's gonna carve ya...

08:35.883 --> 08:37.949
like a turkey!

08:37.951 --> 08:42.687
Ha! McDoom!
More like McDone For!

08:42.689 --> 08:43.822
(laughing)
Am I right?

08:43.824 --> 08:45.757
(panting)

08:45.758 --> 08:47.691
Hey, Blondie, you got
the deluxe seats, too, huh?

08:47.694 --> 08:50.862
You know, they put you up here
so you can see all the action.

08:50.864 --> 08:53.732
Really?
It's kind of far.

08:53.734 --> 08:59.638
Next up,
the unstoppable
Wreck Marauder!

08:59.640 --> 09:01.706
(growling)

09:03.010 --> 09:06.144
Wreck has three words for you!

09:06.146 --> 09:10.081
You're gonna get wrecked!

09:10.083 --> 09:12.817
Hey. If I didn't know
any better, I'd swear

09:12.819 --> 09:16.721
that guy down there
looks just like... Cassandra?

09:16.723 --> 09:20.892
That is Cassandra!
Wow! I've never seen Cass
so nervous.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.695
-Ooh...
-I guess I can't blame her.

09:23.697 --> 09:27.666
I mean, she worked
so hard to get invited
to this competition.

09:27.668 --> 09:29.901
Invited? No, you don't need
an invitation to compete.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.836
You just have
to be dumb enough
to do it.

09:31.838 --> 09:34.739
Like Cassandra.
Ha-ha! Wooo!

09:34.741 --> 09:36.741
Anyone can compete?

09:36.743 --> 09:40.679
We can do this together!

09:40.681 --> 09:42.781
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you,
thank you!

09:42.783 --> 09:44.849
Oh oh oh, hey, uh, Blondie,
if you're making a snack run,

09:44.851 --> 09:46.751
I'm all about the popcorn!

09:46.753 --> 09:50.755
And finally,
the Iron Handmaiden,

09:50.757 --> 09:55.927
Caaasan--
Wow. Ladies and gentlemen,

09:55.929 --> 09:59.864
we have a last-minute
surprise entry!

09:59.866 --> 10:03.034
Please welcome
the Fearsome Follicle,

10:03.036 --> 10:05.203
the Heir with the Hair,

10:05.205 --> 10:11.876
the Maid with the Braid,
Rapunzel!

10:11.878 --> 10:14.879
(cheering)

10:14.881 --> 10:17.048
Yay, Rapunzel!

10:19.086 --> 10:23.054
Cassandra!
This is gonna be
so much fun!

10:23.056 --> 10:26.958
Oh, Blondie,
what have you done?

10:26.960 --> 10:29.194
Did I not bring enough
of the popcorn?

10:32.165 --> 10:35.066
Good news, Cassandra.
We can compete together!

10:35.068 --> 10:36.101
Isn't that great?

10:36.103 --> 10:37.135
Eeee!

10:37.137 --> 10:39.738
That is so great!

10:39.740 --> 10:44.109
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's time for the first event!

10:44.111 --> 10:47.178
The Gauntlet!

10:50.817 --> 10:52.150
Aah! Ooh-ooh-ooh!

10:52.152 --> 10:54.786
-(clattering)
-(audience cheering)

10:54.788 --> 10:56.121
You're sure
you wanna do this?

10:56.123 --> 10:57.155
Sure do!

10:57.157 --> 11:01.159
Next up for The Gauntlet,
Cassandra!

11:01.161 --> 11:03.128
(panting) Excuse me.
Comin' through.

11:03.130 --> 11:06.031
Emergency. Naive princess
making horrible life decision.

11:06.033 --> 11:07.098
Pardon me.

11:13.273 --> 11:15.774
What's that supposed to be?

11:15.776 --> 11:20.278
It's a knot...
as in you're knot
going to win.

11:20.280 --> 11:21.946
(laughs)

11:22.949 --> 11:24.883
It's a thinker.

11:25.952 --> 11:27.952
Woo! Go, Cass!

11:32.192 --> 11:35.160
Way to go, Cassandra!
Woo-hoo!

11:35.162 --> 11:39.864
Next up,
Princess Rapunzel!

11:39.866 --> 11:42.901
(rapidly)
Please don't get smashed
with a hammer. Please don't
get smashed with a hammer...

11:47.074 --> 11:48.873
(humming)

11:52.212 --> 11:54.079
(cheering)

11:54.081 --> 11:55.880
Oh, yeah!
(laughs)

11:55.882 --> 11:57.982
That's my girlfriend
right there!

11:57.984 --> 11:59.918
What? I wasn't worried,
she's got this.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.152
Wooo!

12:01.154 --> 12:03.054
Yay, Rapunzel!

12:03.056 --> 12:04.155
Wooo!

12:04.157 --> 12:06.057
(cheering)

12:11.198 --> 12:13.098
Cassandra, did you see that?

12:13.100 --> 12:15.166
I told you
I could handle myself.

12:15.168 --> 12:17.102
Nice dance, Rapunzel.

12:17.104 --> 12:19.003
Uh, thanks?

12:19.005 --> 12:21.172
Not sure that routine
will do much good
against Wreck

12:21.174 --> 12:23.074
in the Dead Man's Circle.

12:25.045 --> 12:27.312
But, hey, maybe
you'll get lucky again.

12:29.850 --> 12:31.282
That wasn't luck.

12:31.284 --> 12:35.320
Announcer:
Challengers! Prepare
for the next event!

12:41.228 --> 12:42.927
Yes!

12:49.369 --> 12:52.070
(cheering)

12:52.072 --> 12:54.239
(horn blaring)

12:54.241 --> 12:55.373
Yeah!

13:13.927 --> 13:15.393
(horn blares)

13:28.141 --> 13:30.909
(cheering)

13:30.911 --> 13:32.410
(horn blaring)

13:40.253 --> 13:41.986
Wow!

13:45.325 --> 13:46.391
(Rapunzel laughs)

13:48.962 --> 13:50.328
Do you even know the rules?

13:50.330 --> 13:53.097
Aren't shoes required
for the Log Roll?

13:53.099 --> 13:55.400
Ugh, somebody check
the Rulebook of the Brave!

13:59.139 --> 14:02.207
Guys! Am I the only one
that has a problem with this?

14:02.209 --> 14:05.376
The princess is making a mockery
of this competition!

14:05.378 --> 14:08.980
Hey, it's okay, kid.
When you're mad, do a dance!

14:08.982 --> 14:12.350
-Give that smile a se--
-Oh, go eat a turkey leg, Hook!

14:15.021 --> 14:17.989
Okay, listen, Rapunzel,
this has gone far enough.

14:17.991 --> 14:20.642
Let's call it a day.

14:20.643 --> 14:23.294
Ha-ha. I will call it a day...
the day I won the championship.

14:23.296 --> 14:26.030
Boom! Trash talk!

14:26.032 --> 14:29.167
Let's see where you land
after the Dead Man's Circle.

14:29.169 --> 14:32.036
Yeah, okay, yeah.
We'll totally see where we land

14:32.038 --> 14:34.005
after the Dead Man's Circle.

14:34.007 --> 14:35.306
And what is
the Dead Man's Circle?

14:35.308 --> 14:38.076
It's the final event.
And believe me,

14:38.078 --> 14:40.445
your little dances
won't save you this time.

14:42.482 --> 14:44.282
This is awkward.

14:46.086 --> 14:50.221
I am beginning to question
their definition of VIP seating.

14:50.223 --> 14:53.124
(grunts)

14:53.125 --> 14:56.026
Hello, my good man.
I'd like to forgo
my VIP seat

14:56.029 --> 14:58.029
and re-enter the arena.

14:58.031 --> 14:59.197
Your ticket, please?

14:59.199 --> 15:02.500
Seriously?
Oh! Oh oh! It's in my wallet.

15:02.502 --> 15:05.036
Which I left
inside the arena.

15:05.038 --> 15:07.238
Well, then you have
to buy another ticket.

15:07.240 --> 15:11.075
But because my money
is also in my wallet,

15:11.077 --> 15:12.410
which is still
inside the arena--

15:12.412 --> 15:15.346
No money, no ticket,
no entry.

15:15.348 --> 15:18.316
(children laughing)

15:23.256 --> 15:26.357
Announcer:
Time for the final event!

15:26.359 --> 15:30.261
The Dead Man's Circle!

15:30.263 --> 15:35.433
Each warrior will battle
to the finish, using the weapon
of their choice!

15:39.539 --> 15:42.206
Get your princess wigs
right here!

15:44.210 --> 15:47.045
Wow, Rapunzel's really
killin' in there, huh?

15:47.047 --> 15:48.546
I mean, these things
are sellin' like hotcakes!

15:48.548 --> 15:50.515
You know what?
This one's on the house.

15:59.492 --> 16:02.160
Hey, you dropped the--

16:10.136 --> 16:13.137
One golden-haired wig
for you!

16:15.241 --> 16:17.308
Okay, one ticket, please.

16:22.315 --> 16:25.416
I got one ticket.
Anybody need a ticket?

16:25.418 --> 16:26.517
I need a ticket!

16:26.519 --> 16:30.188
Then let the bargaining begin.

16:32.525 --> 16:35.493
(cheering)

16:41.601 --> 16:47.171
Hey, I-- I know today's
been weird.

16:47.173 --> 16:50.174
I just-- I wanted to--
I don't know, I guess...

16:50.176 --> 16:53.411
uh, I just wanted to say
good luck.

16:55.281 --> 16:57.448
Right, right.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

16:57.450 --> 17:00.385
No hugging,
gotta remember that.

17:01.554 --> 17:03.554
-Raps, I just wanna--
-It's now time

17:03.556 --> 17:07.492
for the no-holds-barred
elimination round!
-(cheering)

17:07.494 --> 17:11.462
Remember folks,
once someone steps
outside the ring,

17:11.464 --> 17:13.331
they are out!

17:13.333 --> 17:16.567
The last one standing
is our champion!

17:16.569 --> 17:19.404
(cheering)

17:19.406 --> 17:22.240
-I just wanna say--
-Are you ready for this?

17:22.242 --> 17:24.609
'Cause it's gonna
get ugly in here.

17:25.545 --> 17:30.281
Ready! Set! Battle!

17:36.389 --> 17:38.256
Oh, w-- wait wait wait!

17:38.258 --> 17:41.225
Has anyone seen
a frying pan?

17:42.262 --> 17:44.162
Whoa!

17:44.164 --> 17:46.230
Ha! (laughs)

17:46.232 --> 17:49.233
Looks like
I got the drop on you!

17:54.340 --> 17:55.573
Yee-uhh!

17:56.509 --> 17:57.608
Is that all you got?

17:57.610 --> 18:00.178
(grunting)

18:00.180 --> 18:02.413
-You fools take on Wreck!
-(clears throat)

18:04.217 --> 18:05.583
(growling)

18:09.222 --> 18:10.688
(grunts)

18:10.690 --> 18:12.690
(crowd gasps)

18:12.692 --> 18:14.459
Ohhh!

18:15.428 --> 18:17.395
(bell rings)

18:17.397 --> 18:18.463
(bell rings twice)

18:18.465 --> 18:21.532
Announcer:
Wow, what a poetic move
by Rapunzel!

18:21.534 --> 18:24.702
Crowd (chanting):
Rapunzel! Rapunzel!

18:24.704 --> 18:28.539
Rapunzel!
Rapunzel!

18:28.541 --> 18:32.376
That chirpy little hairball
is mine!

18:32.378 --> 18:34.545
Not if I get to her first!

18:36.316 --> 18:38.416
(grunts)

18:38.418 --> 18:40.485
Hey, Wreck! Stick around.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.689
Uh, that was close.

18:46.426 --> 18:49.427
Well, looks like
it's just you and me.

18:49.429 --> 18:51.729
Ooh... aah!

18:51.731 --> 18:53.664
That all you got?

19:00.740 --> 19:03.341
Cass, what's gotten into you?

19:03.343 --> 19:04.642
(Wreck laughing)

19:04.644 --> 19:06.744
Hey!

19:06.746 --> 19:09.313
Whoa whoa whoa
whoa whoa!

19:10.316 --> 19:13.317
Wait, stop!
We're supposed to be friends!

19:13.319 --> 19:16.687
A friend wouldn't
be so oblivious, Rapunzel.

19:16.689 --> 19:19.657
You have no idea
what this contest
means to me.

19:19.659 --> 19:22.493
I mean, you're a princess,
you've got nothing to prove.

19:22.495 --> 19:25.329
To you, this was just a fun way
to blow off a Saturday,

19:25.331 --> 19:28.666
but to me, it was a chance
to show everyone
that I am more

19:28.668 --> 19:32.303
than just your lady-in-waiting.

19:32.305 --> 19:36.407
And just when I thought
I might get even the slightest
bit of respect.

19:38.444 --> 19:39.677
Never mind.

19:39.679 --> 19:42.713
Respect?
Cassandra, I respect you

19:42.715 --> 19:47.385
more than you could possibly
imagine. I mean, I-- I look up
to you.

19:47.387 --> 19:49.687
Why do you think I wanted
to enter this thing
in the first place?

19:49.689 --> 19:53.724
You are my friend,
and... as your friend,

19:53.726 --> 19:58.362
ahh-- I should've realized
how important this was to you.

19:58.364 --> 20:02.366
I'm so... so sorry.

20:05.471 --> 20:06.571
(cheering)

20:06.573 --> 20:09.740
(growling)

20:09.742 --> 20:11.475
Look out!

20:12.579 --> 20:14.412
(growling)

20:17.817 --> 20:19.550
(groans)

20:21.821 --> 20:24.755
(shouting)

20:28.361 --> 20:30.394
(crowd gasps)

20:36.402 --> 20:40.438
-(bell rings)
-Hey, Wreck! Looks like
I'm not not going to win!

20:40.440 --> 20:42.506
Heh... it's a thinker!

20:42.508 --> 20:44.508
(cheering)

20:44.510 --> 20:46.410
(bell rings)

20:47.513 --> 20:49.413
(crowd groaning)

20:57.624 --> 21:01.559
(cheering)

21:01.561 --> 21:03.427
Congratulations.

21:03.429 --> 21:05.363
I didn't mean
for this to happen, Cass.

21:05.365 --> 21:07.598
I just thought
it would be fun
to compete.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.767
(sighs)
Doesn't matter.

21:09.769 --> 21:12.637
I should've realized
how important this
all was to you.

21:13.706 --> 21:17.742
I don't think I'm the one
who deserves this.

21:17.744 --> 21:20.778
(cheering)

21:26.552 --> 21:28.619
Yay, Cassandra!

21:28.621 --> 21:30.488
Woo hoo! Haha!

21:34.727 --> 21:36.494
What, no hug?

21:44.671 --> 21:47.571
How do you sleep
at night, Shorty?

21:47.573 --> 21:49.874
Challenge of the Brave,
here I come!

22:01.521 --> 22:03.921
Shorty, I want
my money back!

22:06.793 --> 22:09.927
(theme music playing)

22:09.929 --> 22:12.830
<i> ¶ Now I got my eyes open</i>
<i> and wide ¶</i>

22:12.832 --> 22:15.599
<i> ¶ My heart burnin' like fire ¶</i>

22:15.601 --> 22:17.835
<i> ¶ Feels like I'm so alive ¶</i>

22:17.837 --> 22:19.704
<i> ¶ I'm never goin' back ¶</i>

22:19.706 --> 22:22.707
<i> ¶ Whatever I want now</i>
<i> I'm gonna chase ¶</i>

22:22.709 --> 22:25.509
<i>¶ Who I am I can't contain it ¶</i>

22:25.511 --> 22:28.612
<i> ¶ I'm not gonna hold it in ¶</i>

22:28.614 --> 22:30.881
<i> ¶ 'Cause there's more of me</i>
<i> to give ¶</i>

22:32.485 --> 22:35.686
<i> ¶ Oh yeah</i>
<i> There's more of me to give ¶</i>
