WEBVTT

00:03.120 --> 00:04.148
Oh, good.

00:04.149 --> 00:05.348
Your whole gang's here.

00:05.350 --> 00:06.583
Aah!

00:06.585 --> 00:09.753
Are you okay? 'Cause
your nails are hitting bone.

00:09.755 --> 00:11.788
It's just, your friends
are such a tight knit bunch.

00:11.790 --> 00:13.710
They joke around with each
other, and I feel like

00:13.734 --> 00:15.592
the new girl who doesn't
know who to sit with

00:15.594 --> 00:16.760
in the cafeteria.

00:16.762 --> 00:18.528
Well, you're in luck,
because you get to sit

00:18.530 --> 00:20.730
next to the big man on campus.

00:21.866 --> 00:22.866
Me.

00:23.935 --> 00:25.402
Hey, everybody.

00:25.404 --> 00:27.404
Say hi, loudly, to Charlotte.

00:27.406 --> 00:28.638
- Hey, Charlotte.
- Hello!

00:28.640 --> 00:29.906
Hello, Charlotte!

00:31.142 --> 00:33.443
Why didn't you tell me
Charlotte was deaf?

00:33.445 --> 00:37.781
Emily, can you bring over
another chair, please?

00:37.783 --> 00:40.350
Oh! Great.

00:40.352 --> 00:42.419
Thanks.

00:43.521 --> 00:46.022
Glad I didn't wear a skirt. (chuckles)

00:46.024 --> 00:48.858
You guys want any appetizers?

00:48.860 --> 00:51.928
Yeah. How about a big veggie
platter for the table?

00:54.332 --> 00:56.499
Are you joking?

00:56.501 --> 00:58.969
Of course I am.

00:58.971 --> 01:00.537
Ha!

01:00.539 --> 01:02.706
Just bring us one of everything, fried.

01:02.708 --> 01:05.408
(laughs) Yeah. The way to win
our hearts is to clog 'em.

01:05.410 --> 01:06.509
MURPH: Oh, hey! Guys.

01:06.511 --> 01:08.411
My segment's about to start.

01:08.413 --> 01:09.713
Hey, pipe down, everybody!

01:09.715 --> 01:11.781
My client is about to come on TV.

01:12.817 --> 01:14.417
(chuckling): No. N-Not Oscar.

01:14.419 --> 01:16.386
My new client, Murph.

01:16.388 --> 01:18.755
CROWD: Oh!

01:18.757 --> 01:20.390
I'm in this segment, too.

01:20.392 --> 01:22.192
Shh!

01:22.194 --> 01:24.995
I'm Marcus Murphy,
and this is Pick Against a Pro,

01:24.997 --> 01:28.131
where a local sports fan goes up
against a professional analyst.

01:28.133 --> 01:31.067
This week, our sport is hockey.

01:31.069 --> 01:34.504
And our pro is veteran
radio host, Oscar Madison.

01:34.506 --> 01:35.905
"Veteran"?

01:35.907 --> 01:38.441
Oh. That doesn't mean soldier,
it just means old.

01:39.577 --> 01:41.378
It's not a stretch, but I got to go

01:41.380 --> 01:44.080
with the Islanders over
the Hurricanes, 'cause...

01:44.082 --> 01:46.583
He kept talking. (chuckles)

01:46.585 --> 01:48.351
Now let's hear from our amateur.

01:48.353 --> 01:49.819
He works at the Central Park Zoo,

01:49.821 --> 01:51.621
and let's just say he's a pretty...

01:51.623 --> 01:54.157
cool customer.

01:54.159 --> 01:55.725
The Ice Man.

02:01.932 --> 02:04.067
(trilling)

02:04.069 --> 02:05.769
And there you have it. The Ice Man

02:05.771 --> 02:08.405
seems pretty confident
with the Hurricanes.

02:08.407 --> 02:10.573
Unless he's just... winging it.

02:12.910 --> 02:15.712
Murph, you could've told me
The Ice Man was not a human.

02:15.714 --> 02:17.414
Oh, sorry. I-I, personally,

02:17.416 --> 02:20.350
I always just assume bird
unless told otherwise.

02:21.786 --> 02:24.154
Hey. I almost forgot.
I have extra tickets

02:24.156 --> 02:27.724
to tonight's performance of
kabuki Shakespeare. Any takers?

02:27.726 --> 02:29.793
- (groaning)
- Yuck!

02:31.429 --> 02:33.797
Everyone said no to you!

02:35.585 --> 02:38.581
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<font color="#33FF00"><b>awaqeded</b></font> for <font color="#33FF00"><b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

02:39.243 --> 02:41.658
Big deal. So the penguin
randomly waddled

02:41.659 --> 02:43.425
through the Maple Leafs gate.

02:43.427 --> 02:45.728
Any dumb animal can get lucky.

02:45.730 --> 02:49.498
MAN: So far, the penguin's 9-2,
while you're 4-7.

02:49.500 --> 02:52.101
Who's the dumb animal again, huh?

02:53.303 --> 02:55.070
Yeah. Well, unlike The Ice Man,

02:55.072 --> 02:58.974
none of my family
has been eaten by seals.

03:00.110 --> 03:01.710
That's our show. Thanks for listening.

03:01.712 --> 03:03.879
I'm Oscar Madison.

03:03.881 --> 03:05.915
Wow. People can't stop
talking about that bird.

03:05.917 --> 03:07.449
I wonder if he has an agent.

03:07.451 --> 03:09.585
Yeah. That Ice Man is pretty adorable.

03:09.587 --> 03:12.755
More adorable than me,
when I sign your paychecks?

03:12.757 --> 03:14.757
Don't make me choose
between cute and money.

03:18.762 --> 03:19.762
(humming)

03:19.764 --> 03:20.930
Hey.

03:20.932 --> 03:22.965
How was your sports
discussion broadcast?

03:22.967 --> 03:25.034
Wall-to-wall penguins.

03:25.036 --> 03:27.836
Global warming can't
happen fast enough.

03:27.838 --> 03:30.072
Well, I got to go. Work stuff.

03:30.074 --> 03:32.942
Hi. I'd like to order a
gift basket for a penguin.

03:32.944 --> 03:34.877
Oh, hey.

03:34.879 --> 03:37.580
Hey, everyone! Great news.

03:37.582 --> 03:40.149
So, blings.com just asked me

03:40.151 --> 03:43.252
- to be their Jewelry Designer of the Month!
- Oh!

03:43.254 --> 03:46.121
Insert cocky hair flip here.

03:46.123 --> 03:48.290
(laughs) Look at you,
getting all successful.

03:48.292 --> 03:49.458
I know!

03:49.460 --> 03:51.160
They even want a photo of me.

03:51.162 --> 03:53.028
And lucky for me,

03:53.030 --> 03:55.364
I know a very gifted photographer.

03:56.299 --> 03:57.800
Who is it? Felix must know him.

03:58.768 --> 04:00.736
What do you say, Felix?

04:00.738 --> 04:02.638
I would be honored.
We could do it at my studio.

04:02.640 --> 04:04.120
I'll block out the whole day for you.

04:04.144 --> 04:05.307
Thank you so much!

04:05.309 --> 04:06.709
My pleasure.

04:06.711 --> 04:08.631
Oscar, would you like
to help me with the dishes?

04:08.655 --> 04:10.221
(scoffs) No.

04:11.581 --> 04:14.083
There's a blueberry muffin
batter bowl that needs licking.

04:14.085 --> 04:16.218
Yes.

04:19.322 --> 04:20.822
Can you believe how far we've come?

04:20.825 --> 04:24.260
It's the kitchen.
It's, like, eight feet.

04:24.262 --> 04:27.496
Me and Emily. We're finally on
the path to being friends again.

04:27.498 --> 04:29.418
Don't you think that's
gonna be a little awkward?

04:29.442 --> 04:31.500
You two being alone
after she dumped you?

04:31.502 --> 04:33.068
No. It's the perfect
way for us to get back

04:33.070 --> 04:34.637
to how it was before we started dating.

04:34.639 --> 04:36.999
I don't know. The last time
you looked at her Facebook page,

04:37.023 --> 04:39.508
you got so worked up,
you had to take a bubble bath.

04:39.510 --> 04:42.144
That was months ago,

04:42.146 --> 04:44.446
and those were foaming bath salts.

04:46.349 --> 04:49.952
And I chose the perfect
dress to showcase the jewelry.

04:49.954 --> 04:52.588
(chuckles) Are you sure
this is a good idea?

04:52.590 --> 04:55.124
- What?
- A full-day photoshoot with your ex?

04:55.126 --> 04:57.026
The last time you asked
him to do something,

04:57.028 --> 04:58.727
it was to stop being your boyfriend.

05:00.864 --> 05:02.498
That's why I chose him.

05:02.500 --> 05:03.899
I already rejected him once.

05:03.901 --> 05:05.964
If he heard I went with
a different photographer,

05:05.965 --> 05:06.966
it would break his heart.

05:06.990 --> 05:09.538
So, you're doing this
because you feel guilty?

05:09.540 --> 05:12.441
That's why I do most things.

05:12.443 --> 05:15.144
My parents were very religious.

05:15.146 --> 05:18.247
Besides, Felix is an incredibly
talented photographer.

05:18.249 --> 05:20.649
When we were dating, he used
to take my picture all the time.

05:20.673 --> 05:21.317
Hmm.

05:21.319 --> 05:23.252
In fact, he took some very tasteful...

05:23.254 --> 05:24.153
Don't say it.

05:24.155 --> 05:26.789
...Boudoir photos.

05:26.791 --> 05:29.271
I just think you guys are in a
different place now, and I just,

05:29.295 --> 05:31.460
really think you should
find another photographer.

05:31.462 --> 05:33.395
No. I don't want to
look for someone new.

05:33.397 --> 05:35.030
I want Felix.

05:35.032 --> 05:38.567
I can't imagine anyone
being better for me than him.

05:40.837 --> 05:42.237
Oh, my God.

05:42.239 --> 05:45.207
Yeah. I'm not proud.

05:45.209 --> 05:46.809
No, no. I just overheard Emily,

05:46.811 --> 05:48.731
and I think she might
still have feelings for me.

05:48.755 --> 05:50.746
- Really?
- Yes. I don't know what to do.

05:50.748 --> 05:52.843
I've spent the past few months
getting over her, and now,

05:52.844 --> 05:54.116
suddenly she's opening the door again.

05:54.118 --> 05:55.284
This is very confusing.

05:55.286 --> 05:57.052
How are you gonna
handle the photo shoot?

05:57.054 --> 05:58.614
Well, I'll just have to hide my anxiety

05:58.638 --> 06:00.723
and appear completely professional.

06:00.725 --> 06:02.658
I'll be calm and cool and collected.

06:02.660 --> 06:03.659
- Felix?
- (screams)

06:03.661 --> 06:06.595
Ooh! Sorry.

06:06.597 --> 06:09.164
(chuckles) I was just gonna say,
I will see you tomorrow.

06:09.166 --> 06:10.632
And I'm looking forward to it.

06:10.634 --> 06:13.369
Forward is also the direction
that I am looking.

06:13.371 --> 06:14.770
To it.

06:14.772 --> 06:18.874
"It" being the photo shoot.
<i>Hasta ma√±ana.</i>

06:21.478 --> 06:22.611
Hi, Felix.

06:22.613 --> 06:24.913
Oh! Emily. Welcome to the photo studio.

06:24.915 --> 06:26.482
(they chuckle)

06:26.484 --> 06:28.084
- You can put your coat over there.
- Oh.

06:30.086 --> 06:31.320
(shrieks)

06:31.322 --> 06:33.088
Is that what you're wearing?

06:33.090 --> 06:34.757
Yeah. Is it too much?

06:34.759 --> 06:36.759
No. (chuckles)

06:36.761 --> 06:39.161
Maybe it's too little. Ha, ha...

06:40.130 --> 06:41.697
(exhales)

06:41.699 --> 06:42.865
Well. Shall we get started?

06:42.867 --> 06:45.868
Great. So, what do you
want to do with me?

06:52.075 --> 06:54.109
Are you okay?

06:56.646 --> 07:00.149
Ah. Okay. So, let's just, uh...

07:00.151 --> 07:02.184
- get you, uh, on your mark over here.
- Okay.

07:02.186 --> 07:03.485
And, uh...

07:03.487 --> 07:05.888
Okay. Good. Um... And the, uh,

07:05.890 --> 07:07.623
uh, the necklace needs to move

07:07.625 --> 07:09.525
a little bit more,
into the, uh, the center,

07:09.527 --> 07:11.493
- of, uh, you're, um...
- Hmm?

07:11.495 --> 07:13.462
Chestal region, there.

07:13.464 --> 07:15.149
- Oh.
- I'll let you do that.

07:15.150 --> 07:17.150
Great! And perfect. Let's
start shooting, shall we?

07:17.174 --> 07:17.433
Oh!

07:17.435 --> 07:18.834
Okay. (chuckles)

07:18.836 --> 07:21.703
Great. Shoulders back. Okay, not
that far back. And long neck,

07:21.705 --> 07:23.080
Long neck. Way longer.

07:23.081 --> 07:24.947
Not that long.
Obviously, not that long.

07:24.949 --> 07:26.237
Great. And tilt the head?

07:26.238 --> 07:27.559
Let's get a head tilt. Other way.

07:27.583 --> 07:29.251
Other way, obviously.
Obvi... Okay. Great.

07:29.253 --> 07:31.287
And smile. It's great.

07:31.289 --> 07:33.055
This feels a little awkward.

07:33.057 --> 07:35.324
You're telling me. (sniffles)

07:36.593 --> 07:38.480
MURPH: <i>After a week,</i>

07:38.481 --> 07:41.315
The Ice Man is ahead
with a record of 21-7,

07:41.317 --> 07:44.652
while Oscar Madison is 14-14.

07:44.654 --> 07:48.522
Seems like Oscar's picks
are... for the birds.

07:48.524 --> 07:50.825
Yeah!

07:50.827 --> 07:52.460
Hey, everybody.

07:52.462 --> 07:53.828
I brought snacks.

07:53.830 --> 07:56.197
I already ate.
I had a baby carrot yesterday.

07:56.199 --> 07:58.532
No. Not veggies.

07:58.534 --> 08:00.134
Heart-clogging hot wings!

08:00.136 --> 08:01.402
- Ooh, girl!
- Oh!

08:01.404 --> 08:03.070
- If you insist.
- Bring 'em here, woman!

08:03.072 --> 08:04.672
Hmm-hmm... Uh-uh-uh!

08:04.674 --> 08:07.575
You better not, Oscar. You know
how birds make you choke.

08:07.577 --> 08:09.377
(laughter)

08:09.379 --> 08:11.019
Yeah. Instead of calling
them bird brains,

08:11.021 --> 08:12.588
they should call them Oscar brains.

08:12.590 --> 08:13.681
(laughter)

08:13.683 --> 08:16.784
Yeah, Oscar. You know,
the penguin's your arch enemy,

08:16.786 --> 08:18.419
but you're no Batman.

08:19.855 --> 08:21.689
- What?
- You got it, Charlotte!

08:21.691 --> 08:23.724
You go, girl. Burn, baby. Burn!

08:23.726 --> 08:25.893
Laugh all you want,
but I'm not giving up.

08:25.895 --> 08:29.530
I'm gonna tap into my NHL source
and get some inside information.

08:29.532 --> 08:32.732
The penguin's lucky
streak is about to end.

08:32.735 --> 08:34.869
- Well, you're gonna need this.
- Why?

08:34.871 --> 08:38.205
'Cause you're about
to get foiled again!

08:38.207 --> 08:40.775
(laughter)

08:40.777 --> 08:42.376
(grunting)

08:42.378 --> 08:46.247
Actually, that is not from
the Batman world, that's from...

08:46.249 --> 08:47.548
Whatever, nerd!

08:47.550 --> 08:48.849
(laughter)

08:48.851 --> 08:50.418
Have a wing, have a wing, girl.

08:50.420 --> 08:51.162
Go Bailey!

08:58.821 --> 09:00.789
So...

09:00.791 --> 09:03.425
What do you think?

09:03.427 --> 09:05.817
My mom told me that if I don't
have something nice to say,

09:05.818 --> 09:07.884
to just change the subject.

09:09.320 --> 09:11.788
Isn't is amazing how long turtles live?

09:11.790 --> 09:13.223
(groans)

09:13.225 --> 09:15.258
You hate these pictures
as much as I do.

09:15.260 --> 09:17.160
I'm sorry, girl, but these stink.

09:17.162 --> 09:19.863
I know. You were right.
It was so uncomfortable.

09:19.865 --> 09:21.431
Felix wouldn't even touch me.

09:21.433 --> 09:24.968
It was like I was a motel bedspread.

09:24.970 --> 09:28.772
You have got to get new photos,
and if you can't relax with him,

09:28.774 --> 09:30.807
then you got to use somebody else.

09:30.809 --> 09:32.109
No. I can't fire Felix.

09:32.111 --> 09:34.745
I'm trying to erase my
guilt, not add to it.

09:34.747 --> 09:36.713
Then you need to ask
him for another shoot,

09:36.715 --> 09:39.316
but this time,
do it someplace where you,

09:39.318 --> 09:41.351
you feel comfortable
and-and you're relaxed,

09:41.353 --> 09:43.887
not when you're looking
like someone who...

09:43.889 --> 09:46.590
- Ate bad Mexican food?
- Mm.

09:46.592 --> 09:47.624
Swallowed a bug?

09:47.626 --> 09:48.992
Girl...

09:48.994 --> 09:50.861
- Just got their kidneys stolen?
- Mm-hmm.

09:52.196 --> 09:55.265
Hey, Felix. This is Luc
Robitaille. He was a King.

09:55.267 --> 09:58.135
Your Highness.

09:58.137 --> 10:01.304
No, no. He used to play
hockey for the L.A. Kings.

10:01.306 --> 10:03.473
He's giving me the inside
scoop on all the games.

10:03.475 --> 10:04.674
Inside scoop?

10:04.676 --> 10:06.516
- I thought we were just catching up.
- We are.

10:06.540 --> 10:08.211
We're catching up on, uh, the fact

10:08.213 --> 10:10.013
that the Rangers' goalie has insomnia,

10:10.015 --> 10:12.549
Duran's being audited,
and, uh, what's up with Korczak?

10:12.551 --> 10:14.017
He's been terrible lately.

10:14.019 --> 10:15.185
His mom's in a coma.

10:15.187 --> 10:17.521
Yes!

10:17.523 --> 10:19.723
I mean, because she still
has a chance to pull through.

10:20.691 --> 10:24.528
Oilers... to lose.

10:24.530 --> 10:26.997
I have to go. Bye, Oscar.

10:26.999 --> 10:29.199
Give it up. That bird's your daddy.

10:35.373 --> 10:38.508
Oscar, I'm in a tough spot.
I need some advice.

10:38.510 --> 10:40.544
Really? Are you having
your ass handed to you

10:40.546 --> 10:42.579
by a penguin?

10:42.581 --> 10:45.115
No, it's Emily. Now I am positive

10:45.117 --> 10:46.477
that she wants to rekindle things.

10:46.501 --> 10:48.518
At the photo shoot,
she wore a sexy dress,

10:48.520 --> 10:50.400
and she was practically
begging me to touch her.

10:50.424 --> 10:52.823
And take a look at the sexual tension

10:52.825 --> 10:54.024
in these photos, huh?

10:54.026 --> 10:56.993
Love, love...

10:56.995 --> 11:00.130
lust.

11:00.132 --> 11:02.399
Really? 'Cause that looks like a still

11:02.401 --> 11:05.202
from a hostage video.

11:05.204 --> 11:06.303
What are you gonna do?

11:06.305 --> 11:07.971
I don't know. I mean,

11:07.973 --> 11:09.413
if she's up for it, maybe I am, too.

11:09.437 --> 11:11.107
Well, just be careful.

11:11.109 --> 11:12.429
I would hate to see you get hurt.

11:12.453 --> 11:13.877
(phone vibrates)

11:13.879 --> 11:15.879
Pittsburgh lost?

11:15.881 --> 11:18.548
How could a penguin
not pick the Penguins?

11:19.750 --> 11:21.551
Hey, Felix.

11:21.553 --> 11:22.986
Emily.

11:22.988 --> 11:24.087
- Hey.
- Hello.

11:24.089 --> 11:25.422
Hi. (chuckles)

11:25.424 --> 11:28.692
Um, I just looked at the
photos... love them.

11:28.694 --> 11:31.561
In fact, um, I love them so much

11:31.563 --> 11:33.497
I actually want more.

11:33.499 --> 11:35.298
I was wondering,

11:35.300 --> 11:37.234
could we maybe do another day together?

11:37.236 --> 11:39.236
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:39.238 --> 11:42.105
And I was thinking that,
um, maybe this time

11:42.107 --> 11:46.576
we could do it in a more,
uh, relaxed setting.

11:46.578 --> 11:48.979
Maybe I could come to your place.

11:48.981 --> 11:50.881
What do you say?

11:52.416 --> 11:54.718
I say okay.

11:54.720 --> 11:57.454
Great. It is a date.

11:59.000 --> 12:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:15.273 --> 12:17.107
- Hello.
- Oh, hey, Charlotte.

12:17.109 --> 12:19.075
- There she is!
- Hey.

12:19.077 --> 12:21.478
I just heard the score
of the Devils-Flyers game.

12:21.480 --> 12:24.414
Sorry, you lose. Peng-win!

12:24.416 --> 12:27.017
(laughter)

12:27.019 --> 12:29.219
I don't understand how this
bird is winning so much.

12:29.221 --> 12:30.420
Unless someone's helping him.

12:30.422 --> 12:31.588
Someone from the inside.

12:31.590 --> 12:33.456
If you weren't my boss,
I'd call you crazy.

12:33.458 --> 12:34.958
Charlotte, call him crazy.

12:36.527 --> 12:39.095
No, actually, I think
maybe Oscar's right.

12:39.097 --> 12:42.666
Maybe the penguin's got
a mole on the inside.

12:42.668 --> 12:44.935
An actual mole!

12:44.937 --> 12:46.169
(laughter)

12:46.171 --> 12:48.471
Damn, Char, you are bringing it!

12:48.473 --> 12:51.141
Ah-ah!

12:51.143 --> 12:53.443
Oscar, the show starts in a minute.

12:53.445 --> 12:55.645
Yeah, I'll be right back there.

12:55.647 --> 12:58.315
Did you see that?
I'm finally fitting in.

12:58.317 --> 12:59.397
They even called me "Char."

12:59.421 --> 13:01.585
That's, like, halfway to a nickname.

13:01.587 --> 13:03.787
Yeah, and all you had to do was

13:03.789 --> 13:06.756
- throw me under the bus.
- What?

13:06.758 --> 13:08.191
Just because they're being jerks

13:08.193 --> 13:10.694
doesn't mean you have to
go all Don Rickles on me.

13:10.696 --> 13:12.963
I wish somebody had my back.
I wish you had my back.

13:12.965 --> 13:15.298
Are you serious right now?

13:15.300 --> 13:17.867
Is all the yelling and
arm waving not clear?

13:19.103 --> 13:22.072
I'm sorry, I'm just in a bad place.

13:22.074 --> 13:24.274
Because of the penguin thing?

13:24.276 --> 13:26.710
I know it's silly, but
knowing sports is my job,

13:26.712 --> 13:28.411
and now I'm turning
into a laughing stock

13:28.413 --> 13:30.780
at the one thing I'm
supposed to be good at.

13:30.782 --> 13:32.916
If I lose that, what do I have?

13:32.918 --> 13:35.518
Oscar, I'm sorry.

13:35.520 --> 13:37.420
I didn't know it was
bothering you so much.

13:37.422 --> 13:39.322
That's because I'm good at hiding it.

13:39.324 --> 13:42.325
I've got many levels.

13:42.327 --> 13:43.827
Well, two.

13:45.796 --> 13:47.899
Oscar, the show starts in 30 seconds.

13:47.900 --> 13:49.318
Oh, and there's a zoo in Florida

13:49.401 --> 13:51.101
that wants to see if you
can outwit a manatee.

13:51.103 --> 13:52.583
But don't worry, I did some research,

13:52.607 --> 13:53.510
and they're real dumb.

13:53.512 --> 13:54.671
You probably can do it.

14:00.845 --> 14:02.912
(man clucking)

14:04.682 --> 14:07.617
Well, that doesn't sound
like a penguin at all.

14:07.619 --> 14:09.185
That sounds like a chicken,

14:09.187 --> 14:11.421
so the joke's on you.

14:11.423 --> 14:14.024
My point was you're
scared of the penguin,

14:14.026 --> 14:15.258
so you're a chicken.

14:16.694 --> 14:18.728
Oh, well, that's pretty good.

14:19.830 --> 14:22.332
Please tell me that's our last caller.

14:22.334 --> 14:24.901
Nope. Up next is Charlotte,
from Manhattan.

14:27.304 --> 14:29.739
Hello, Charlotte, you're on the air.

14:29.741 --> 14:31.474
Hi, Oscar.

14:31.476 --> 14:34.244
Everybody thinks
that penguin is so classy

14:34.246 --> 14:36.713
because he looks like
he's wearing a tuxedo,

14:36.715 --> 14:38.381
but I think you're right.

14:38.383 --> 14:41.418
Deep down he's a cheating,
flightless little bastard.

14:43.187 --> 14:45.889
Go on.

14:45.891 --> 14:48.324
If I were you, I'd go down to that zoo

14:48.326 --> 14:49.626
and see what he's up to.

14:49.628 --> 14:51.188
And if you have a
supportive girlfriend,

14:51.190 --> 14:52.430
maybe you could bring her, too.

14:52.454 --> 14:55.365
Charlotte from Manhattan,
that is a great idea.

14:55.367 --> 14:56.366
Thanks for calling.

14:56.368 --> 14:58.468
I'm gonna go get that penguin.

14:58.470 --> 15:00.570
Oscar? Oscar, you got...

15:00.572 --> 15:02.806
Oh, yeah, 40 minutes of show left.

15:14.761 --> 15:16.829
Do you really need sunglasses?

15:16.831 --> 15:18.965
I don't want The Ice
Man to recognize me.

15:20.334 --> 15:23.569
Ugh! Do penguins not have noses?

15:23.571 --> 15:26.138
OSCAR: Well,

15:26.140 --> 15:28.508
something definitely
smells fishy around here.

15:32.246 --> 15:33.579
I'm doing a Batman thing.

15:33.581 --> 15:36.682
Yeah, I got it. It's good.

15:38.485 --> 15:39.986
So...

15:39.988 --> 15:42.655
what's your theory on how
the penguins are cheating?

15:42.657 --> 15:44.524
Well, you see that bucket
of fish right there?

15:44.526 --> 15:46.325
Maybe somebody who knows
a lot about hockey

15:46.327 --> 15:48.895
is luring The Ice Man
through the right gate.

15:48.897 --> 15:49.862
But how do we bust them?

15:51.398 --> 15:53.165
Well, Batman would wait

15:53.167 --> 15:54.267
till the coast was clear,

15:54.269 --> 15:55.535
and then he'd scale this wall

15:55.537 --> 15:57.470
and catch the bad guys red-handed.

15:57.472 --> 16:00.606
Whoa. Maybe you're Batman.

16:00.608 --> 16:03.843
Uh, no, Oscar, that's your thing.

16:03.845 --> 16:05.678
No, I like it.

16:05.680 --> 16:08.514
I'm dating Batman.

16:08.516 --> 16:11.050
- Okay, come on.
- What?

16:11.052 --> 16:13.486
- Come on.
- In...

16:13.488 --> 16:17.223
It's a two-foot wall.
Scale it, scale it!

16:18.926 --> 16:23.729
Whoa. The smell is definitely
not getting better.

16:25.098 --> 16:26.978
MURPH: Hey, you guys set
up in your usual spots.

16:27.002 --> 16:27.900
- Murph's here!
- Hide!

16:27.902 --> 16:28.901
Hide, hide!

16:28.903 --> 16:31.203
Oh...

16:38.478 --> 16:40.479
Hey, Felix. Are you ready?

16:40.481 --> 16:42.715
I think so. Not totally sure.

16:42.717 --> 16:44.550
I've been thinking about it all day.

16:44.552 --> 16:46.632
I guess let's just proceed
and see what happens, hmm?

16:46.656 --> 16:48.455
(hesitantly): Okay.

16:49.356 --> 16:51.424
Well, um, just to make it

16:51.426 --> 16:53.492
a little more comfortable this time,

16:53.494 --> 16:55.027
do you mind if I put on some music?

16:55.029 --> 16:56.495
- Uh, okay, sure.
- Okay, great.

16:56.497 --> 16:57.630
- Of course.
- Ooh.

16:57.632 --> 16:59.632
Can I dim the lights a little?

17:00.901 --> 17:04.002
Ooh, maybe I'll pour some wine.

17:04.005 --> 17:05.137
It'll set the mood.

17:05.138 --> 17:07.607
Help us relax.

17:07.608 --> 17:09.141
(romantic music playing)

17:09.143 --> 17:12.578
Okay. (chuckles)

17:12.579 --> 17:14.646
Second time's a charm.

17:14.648 --> 17:16.648
Emily, I can't do this.

17:16.651 --> 17:18.317
No, you can relax.

17:18.319 --> 17:19.752
I saw you do it once.

17:22.356 --> 17:24.290
No, what I mean is...

17:24.291 --> 17:27.893
we can't get back together.

17:27.895 --> 17:29.729
W-Wait, what?

17:29.731 --> 17:31.849
I heard you say that you want me,

17:31.850 --> 17:33.531
and then you invented
a reason to come here

17:33.533 --> 17:34.766
for the second photo shoot,

17:34.768 --> 17:37.870
with the wine and the freaky sex music.

17:37.872 --> 17:38.871
Felix...

17:38.873 --> 17:41.574
(shushing)

17:43.010 --> 17:44.944
Don't embarrass yourself, kid.

17:44.946 --> 17:46.345
It's funny, a couple months ago

17:46.347 --> 17:48.347
this would have been exactly
what I was hoping for.

17:48.349 --> 17:50.229
But I know that since
our breakup, I have grown,

17:50.253 --> 17:52.218
and in my heart, I have moved on.

17:52.220 --> 17:54.687
And, yes, it was hard to get over.

17:54.689 --> 17:58.157
But I did it, and you can, too.

18:01.128 --> 18:02.695
Wow. (chuckles)

18:02.697 --> 18:07.066
You really put all that
together, didn't you?

18:08.402 --> 18:10.102
Uh, news flash,
when you want something,

18:10.104 --> 18:12.238
you are not a subtle woman.

18:12.240 --> 18:14.140
(laughs)

18:14.142 --> 18:16.942
You know what? You are right.

18:16.944 --> 18:18.310
Of course.

18:18.312 --> 18:21.047
- And I'm-I'm really glad that you
- Mm-hmm.

18:21.049 --> 18:24.750
Picked up on all my obvious clues,

18:24.752 --> 18:27.019
and didn't think this was all just some

18:27.021 --> 18:30.122
crazy ploy to get photos
for that Web site.

18:30.124 --> 18:33.192
As if.

18:33.194 --> 18:35.895
And since you kind of

18:35.897 --> 18:38.798
just broke up with me,

18:38.800 --> 18:41.434
now it's like we're even.

18:41.436 --> 18:44.303
I mean, now we can hang out as friends,

18:44.305 --> 18:46.172
and I don't have to feel bad

18:46.174 --> 18:48.407
about breaking up with you anymore.

18:48.409 --> 18:50.042
Yes. Emily,

18:50.044 --> 18:52.178
I'm setting you free.

18:52.180 --> 18:54.447
Oh...

18:54.449 --> 18:56.649
(chuckles)

18:56.651 --> 18:59.652
Well, I mean, since we're here,

18:59.654 --> 19:01.854
should we take some
pictures just for fun?

19:01.856 --> 19:04.690
Sure.

19:04.692 --> 19:06.792
Just as friends?

19:06.794 --> 19:09.428
Just as friends.

19:09.430 --> 19:12.765
Wait, don't move. You look perfect.

19:12.767 --> 19:14.467
(camera shutter clicks)

19:21.134 --> 19:23.366
- Are they still there?
- OSCAR: It may be a while.

19:23.367 --> 19:25.901
Murph's having trouble
pronouncing the word "Montreal""

19:27.404 --> 19:29.572
What's that?

19:29.574 --> 19:30.706
Um...

19:30.708 --> 19:33.042
Bat Juice.

19:33.044 --> 19:34.510
You okay?

19:34.512 --> 19:37.463
There's something I didn't tell you.

19:37.464 --> 19:39.764
Birds absolutely terrify me,

19:39.765 --> 19:42.332
with their pointy beaks
and their flesh-ripping talons.

19:42.334 --> 19:45.802
- I don't think...
- They used to be dinosaurs!

19:45.804 --> 19:47.905
Wow, you're really scared,

19:47.907 --> 19:50.807
and you still did this for me?

19:50.809 --> 19:53.176
Of course.

19:53.178 --> 19:54.378
I love you, Oscar.

19:54.380 --> 19:57.548
And I've got your back no matter what.

20:01.920 --> 20:03.887
(Oscar grunts)

20:03.889 --> 20:08.392
Pointy nails on my bone again.

20:08.394 --> 20:12.129
(whispering): Look behind you.

20:14.866 --> 20:17.868
So many birds.

20:17.870 --> 20:20.637
Okay, let's get you out of here.

20:20.639 --> 20:23.140
No, we can't go now.

20:23.142 --> 20:25.475
We still haven't figured out
how the penguins are cheating.

20:25.477 --> 20:26.957
And what if the camera crew sees you?

20:26.981 --> 20:28.579
Oh, I don't care about them anymore.

20:28.581 --> 20:30.681
All I care is that
Charlotte from Manhattan

20:30.683 --> 20:32.115
is on my side.

20:32.117 --> 20:34.818
Okay?

20:34.820 --> 20:36.119
Don't look directly at them.

20:39.791 --> 20:42.025
Oscar?

20:42.027 --> 20:43.293
Oh, guys,

20:43.295 --> 20:46.063
forget the "Mon-treel" segment,
shoot this.

20:47.165 --> 20:50.434
Oh, no, another one.

20:50.436 --> 20:51.902
(trills)

20:55.873 --> 20:57.941
Well, well, well...

20:57.943 --> 21:00.210
we finally meet face to face.

21:00.212 --> 21:02.713
You may think you're pretty cool,

21:02.715 --> 21:04.214
but you're just a penguin,

21:04.216 --> 21:05.949
and I'm Batman!

21:06.344 --> 21:13.844
