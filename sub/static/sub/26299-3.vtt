WEBVTT

00:01.835 --> 00:02.836
Every afternoon,
I've been going to Luke's campus

00:02.936 --> 00:04.838
to help him train
for rugby tryouts.

00:04.938 --> 00:07.541
What do you say we practice
that lineout lift one last time?

00:07.641 --> 00:08.942
And...
I got to go.

00:09.043 --> 00:10.511
I don't want to be late
for women's studies.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.213
That's what I call
my lunch break.

00:12.313 --> 00:13.214
All right.

00:13.314 --> 00:15.083
Good luck at tryouts.

00:15.183 --> 00:16.250
PHIL: The other day,

00:16.350 --> 00:19.887
something pretty interesting
caught my eye.

00:19.987 --> 00:21.889
Uh...

00:21.989 --> 00:23.891
modifications must be made

00:23.991 --> 00:26.394
to standard
microeconomic procedures

00:26.494 --> 00:30.131
to apply
supply and demand analysis.

00:30.231 --> 00:31.265
Hmm.

00:31.365 --> 00:34.268
First, we construct
a utility function,

00:34.368 --> 00:36.104
where Y equals income

00:36.204 --> 00:38.439
and X equals
the cost of services.

00:38.539 --> 00:39.640
Well...

00:40.541 --> 00:42.776
Uh, next, we vary either X --

00:42.876 --> 00:44.412
Pffffbbbbb.

00:44.512 --> 00:46.880
What --
What's on your mind?

00:46.980 --> 00:49.383
Well, um,
with all due respect,

00:49.483 --> 00:52.120
uh, you have a roomful
of aspiring Realtors here,

00:52.220 --> 00:54.588
and I worry that you might
be turning them off

00:54.688 --> 00:57.091
with all those numbers
and formulas.

00:57.191 --> 01:00.294
It's actually
a very exciting business.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.663
It's about people
and -- and emotional connections

01:02.763 --> 01:04.665
and magnets
with your face on them.

01:04.765 --> 01:06.600
You think you can
just walk in here

01:06.700 --> 01:08.336
and start
teaching this class?

01:08.436 --> 01:09.737
I'm so sorry.
I shouldn't have --

01:09.837 --> 01:11.672
No, I'm asking --
can you teach this class for me?

01:11.772 --> 01:14.575
If I leave now, I won't have to
pay the all-day parking rate.

01:18.412 --> 01:19.447
PHIL:
10 minutes with the dean,

01:19.547 --> 01:22.015
who, it turns out,
I'd sold a house to,

01:22.116 --> 01:23.817
and I was official.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.686
Imagine Phil Dunphy
shaping minds

01:25.786 --> 01:28.289
in the hallowed halls
of Sequoia Community College,

01:28.389 --> 01:30.624
established 2016.

01:30.724 --> 01:37.165
As you can see from this graph,
it's not about X's and Y's.

01:37.265 --> 01:41.369
It's about oohs and ahs.

01:44.372 --> 01:45.473
Mm. Okay.

01:45.573 --> 01:48.642
So, what does
real estate equal?

01:48.742 --> 01:51.945
80%...

01:52.045 --> 01:52.946
eye contact.

01:53.046 --> 01:53.981
(marker clacks)

01:54.081 --> 01:59.487
**

01:59.587 --> 02:04.958
**

02:07.961 --> 02:10.198
All right. Your breakfast
is almost ready.

02:10.298 --> 02:12.500
You're gonna need all your
energy for the courtroom today

02:12.600 --> 02:14.034
in case you have to yell,
"I'm out of order?

02:14.134 --> 02:15.068
You're out of order.

02:15.169 --> 02:16.870
The whole damn system's
out of order!"

02:16.970 --> 02:18.206
Might not do that.

02:18.306 --> 02:19.907
I think I'm winning, so big fan
of the system right now.

02:20.007 --> 02:21.309
Anyway, it can't hurt
Cam.

02:21.409 --> 02:23.877
to have some experienced eyes
take a look at this police work.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.713
Sloppy.
Sloppy, sloppy.

02:25.813 --> 02:28.682
Okay, I know you fancy yourself
some sort of detective.

02:28.782 --> 02:31.419
You know, I was quite
the amateur sleuth as a boy,

02:31.519 --> 02:33.221
a real-life
Encyclopedia Brown.

02:33.321 --> 02:34.722
They called me
Thesaurus Jones.

02:34.822 --> 02:36.824
What I really need right now is
just a few minutes of silence,

02:36.924 --> 02:38.426
just like --
I would say
my toughest case

02:38.526 --> 02:41.161
was "The Case
of the Missing Snowman."
(papers thud)

02:41.262 --> 02:43.364
You know, at first,
I thought he'd come to life,

02:43.464 --> 02:45.233
but turns out --
Oh. Shh! My trial!

02:45.333 --> 02:46.567
REPORTER:
Today marks the fourth day

02:46.667 --> 02:47.935
of witness questioning
by the DA's office.

02:48.035 --> 02:49.737
Oh, my God.
(sputters) Is that you?

02:49.837 --> 02:51.171
I look like an elf
that just walked

02:51.272 --> 02:52.406
into his own
surprise party.

02:52.506 --> 02:53.874
No, it's like the time we tried
to microwave a squash.

02:53.974 --> 02:56.544
I -- Okay,
this is my first big trial,

02:56.644 --> 02:58.412
a-a chance to make
a name for myself.

02:58.512 --> 03:01.415
All anyone's gonna be talking
about is that awful picture!

03:01.515 --> 03:03.016
Okay,
this is a disaster.

03:03.116 --> 03:04.352
Th-- There's a place
downtown

03:04.452 --> 03:05.453
where all the lawyers
go to drink.

03:05.553 --> 03:06.687
It's called The Side Bar.

03:06.787 --> 03:08.689
They put courtroom sketches
on the wall

03:08.789 --> 03:10.591
from everyone's
first big trial.

03:10.691 --> 03:11.559
Maybe nobody saw it.

03:11.659 --> 03:12.693
(cellphone chiming)

03:12.793 --> 03:14.061
Um...

03:14.161 --> 03:16.564
Don't assume the worst.
It could just be an Amber Alert.

03:16.664 --> 03:17.631
(chiming continues)

03:17.731 --> 03:19.467
CLAIRE: Hey, Dad.
JAY: Yo.

03:19.567 --> 03:21.269
Since it's our first day
with our new partners,

03:21.369 --> 03:22.870
I thought maybe
you could get to work

03:22.970 --> 03:25.105
as close to on time
as poss--

03:25.205 --> 03:26.974
I will try my best.

03:27.741 --> 03:29.377
(cellphone beeps)
Hi.

03:29.477 --> 03:30.978
(chuckles)
I'm sorry. Am I late?

03:31.078 --> 03:32.280
NICK: No, no, no, no.
Oh.

03:32.380 --> 03:33.914
And we're not
real time sticklers here.
Ah.

03:34.014 --> 03:35.549
We've found that team members
really excel

03:35.649 --> 03:36.817
when they follow
their own energy rhythms.

03:36.917 --> 03:38.319
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Interesting,
'cause I've found

03:38.419 --> 03:39.587
team members are happiest

03:39.687 --> 03:41.589
when the company stays
in business,

03:41.689 --> 03:44.325
which means
asses in chairs by 9:00.

03:45.426 --> 03:47.561
Dad, could I just have
a quick -- quick sec with you?

03:47.661 --> 03:48.729
Sure.

03:48.829 --> 03:51.432
Um...so, Dad, look,

03:51.532 --> 03:53.667
the culture
is just different here.

03:53.767 --> 03:55.969
And you just can't
come in with a sledgehammer,

03:56.069 --> 03:57.305
or it's gonna create
tension.

03:57.405 --> 03:59.139
You don't want
to alienate people.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.808
So you want me to change
who I am?
No.

04:00.908 --> 04:03.744
I just want you
to hide who you are.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.346
I mean, come on.
Just a little bit.

04:05.446 --> 04:06.314
Let's get rid of this.

04:06.414 --> 04:07.648
Look at that.
That's better already.

04:07.748 --> 04:10.083
Who is this 50-something,
huh?

04:10.183 --> 04:12.853
Fine.
I will be on my best behavior.
Thanks, Dad.

04:12.953 --> 04:14.422
(sighs)

04:14.522 --> 04:16.457
So sorry about that.

04:16.557 --> 04:17.458
Well, it's no problem.

04:17.558 --> 04:18.992
Family time is so important.
Uh-huh.

04:19.092 --> 04:21.429
That's why we offer 14 months
paid paternity leave.

04:21.529 --> 04:23.297
Mm-kay.
Let's see an update

04:23.397 --> 04:25.198
on that Thinfinity model.

04:25.299 --> 04:27.200
Ooh.
Cool design.

04:27.301 --> 04:29.102
Who do I high-five
for that, huh?
Everybody.

04:29.202 --> 04:31.805
Our design meetings
are organized around burstiness,

04:31.905 --> 04:33.807
which is a rapid-fire
creative process

04:33.907 --> 04:36.176
that really just unlocks
the unconscious.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.311
Oh!
(chuckles)

04:37.411 --> 04:39.212
Does anybody else
find that distracting?

04:39.313 --> 04:42.049
Actually, it's great
for left-brain stimulation.

04:42.149 --> 04:43.384
I got winner!

04:43.484 --> 04:44.518
(chuckles)
We don't keep score.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.620
No?
WOMAN:
(muffled) Watch out!

04:46.720 --> 04:47.688
What the hell?!

04:47.788 --> 04:49.323
You don't know
about Zorbing?

04:49.423 --> 04:50.691
It promotes
mind/body balance.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.826
It's kind of like
the German version of Flerming.

04:52.926 --> 04:54.695
Okay, that's it.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.029
Now, I'm about
to introduce you squids

04:56.129 --> 04:57.365
to a little thing called

04:57.465 --> 05:00.334
back-breaking, soul-crushing
hard work.
Mm.

05:00.434 --> 05:02.836
How many heart attacks have you
had here in the last five years?

05:02.936 --> 05:05.005
Zero?
Where am I?!

05:05.105 --> 05:06.840
America loves closets,

05:06.940 --> 05:09.242
and I'm here to build them,
damn it!

05:10.077 --> 05:13.814
And you get this back when I see
people pull up in the morning

05:13.914 --> 05:15.649
crying in their cars.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.520
YYYYYeah.

05:21.054 --> 05:22.656
(indistinct conversations)

05:22.756 --> 05:23.657
Okay, must you?

05:23.757 --> 05:25.325
You know what,
we are gonna make sure

05:25.426 --> 05:27.995
that sketch artist sees the best
possible version of you.

05:28.095 --> 05:30.230
Let's get those apples
a-shining!

05:30.330 --> 05:31.899
Okay, okay, stop.
Don't!

05:31.999 --> 05:33.667
Okay, your face gets weird
when you make that "O" sound,

05:33.767 --> 05:35.235
so avoid that.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.269
A-Are you serious?

05:36.370 --> 05:37.938
The defendant runs
the Orange County

05:38.038 --> 05:39.940
Oceanic and Ornithological
Organization.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.442
That was hard to watch.
Wha--

05:41.542 --> 05:43.176
All rise.

05:43.276 --> 05:44.878
Last looks.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.214
JUDGE: Be seated.

05:47.314 --> 05:51.051
Mr. Pritchett, you may resume
your questioning of the witness.

05:51.151 --> 05:52.553
Okay.

05:52.653 --> 05:54.388
Mitchell. Mitchell.
He's here.

05:54.488 --> 05:56.590
Only give him
your best side.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.426
Avoid the fluorescent lights,
no O's,

05:58.526 --> 06:00.093
and whatever you do, do not
stand next to the bailiff.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.195
He is breathtaking!

06:02.295 --> 06:04.432
Oh, my God.
Counselor?

06:04.532 --> 06:07.100
Uh, sorry, Your Honor.
Um...

06:07.200 --> 06:08.469
Miss Carpenter...
Bad side!

06:08.569 --> 06:13.941
...do you recall seeing this man
on the night in question?

06:14.041 --> 06:15.108
Yes, sir.

06:15.208 --> 06:18.646
And is he,
to your knowledge, the C.E.O...

06:18.746 --> 06:21.782
of the Orange County Oceanic
and Ornithological Organization?

06:21.882 --> 06:23.316
Counselor,
you're mumbling.
Oh --

06:23.417 --> 06:24.485
Can you repeat that,
please?

06:24.585 --> 06:26.920
Does he run
the bird and water place?

06:27.020 --> 06:27.921
He does.

06:28.021 --> 06:30.624
And is he here today
in this, uh...

06:30.724 --> 06:32.392
(scribbling)

06:32.493 --> 06:35.295
As I was saying...
Little further.

06:35.395 --> 06:39.900
...is he here today in this,
uh -- in this courtroom?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.001
That's him.

06:41.101 --> 06:43.336
Let the court note
that I am pretty sure

06:43.437 --> 06:46.306
that the witness has identified
the defendant.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.008
(gasps)

06:53.747 --> 06:54.915
(scribbling)

06:55.015 --> 06:56.149
Elbow patches?

06:56.249 --> 06:58.085
Did you burn through
another blazer at Benihana's?

06:58.185 --> 07:00.320
Actually, it is for
my new position

07:00.420 --> 07:02.956
teaching real estate
at your school.

07:03.056 --> 07:04.024
What are you
talking about?

07:04.124 --> 07:05.292
They offered me a job.

07:05.392 --> 07:06.960
But hey, listen --
listen to me.

07:07.060 --> 07:08.462
Lifelong dreams aside,

07:08.562 --> 07:10.297
I'm not taking this
unless you're on board.

07:10.397 --> 07:11.431
I'm definitely not.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.133
(refrigerator door opens)

07:13.233 --> 07:14.635
I get it.

07:14.735 --> 07:16.169
Don't want your old Pops
cramping your style,

07:16.269 --> 07:17.304
so I'm -- I'm out.

07:17.404 --> 07:18.639
(chuckling)
It's just funny.

07:18.739 --> 07:20.307
I Can't remember the last time
I was this excited.

07:20.407 --> 07:21.542
But it wouldn't --
wouldn't make any sense

07:21.642 --> 07:22.876
unless you were
excited, too.

07:22.976 --> 07:25.613
Not even a little bit.

07:25.713 --> 07:26.947
Right.

07:27.047 --> 07:28.115
Those poor kids,
though, huh?

07:28.215 --> 07:30.183
I have so much to offer.

07:30.283 --> 07:31.485
For example,

07:31.585 --> 07:34.955
which house styles are sold
by which cookie type?

07:35.055 --> 07:37.190
French Revival --
(French accent) macaroons.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.659
(normal voice)
English Tudor --

07:38.759 --> 07:40.193
(British accent)
shortbread.

07:41.361 --> 07:43.564
(normal voice) But...
we both know what you want,

07:43.664 --> 07:45.966
so, uh, I'll resign
and go back

07:46.066 --> 07:49.503
to trying to figure out
what to do with my final years.

07:49.603 --> 07:51.304
Okay.

07:52.540 --> 07:53.707
(knock on door)

07:55.308 --> 07:56.810
I need a place to stay
for a couple of days.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.145
Can't go home,
can't go to school,

07:58.245 --> 07:59.513
don't want
to talk about it.

07:59.613 --> 08:00.648
Got it.

08:00.748 --> 08:03.083
I knew that Alex wanted
to talk about it,

08:03.183 --> 08:05.385
but I had a lot on my mind.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.655
I had a rough morning with Joe.

08:07.755 --> 08:10.357
Have a great first day.

08:10.457 --> 08:12.492
Aren't you gonna
walk me in?

08:12.593 --> 08:15.062
No. In first grade,
you have drop-off.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.731
No one said anything
about drop-off.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.567
What if I can't find
my cubby?

08:19.667 --> 08:21.902
They don't have cubbies.
They have lockers here.

08:22.002 --> 08:24.838
Wait. Wait a second.
Where's my lunchbox?

08:24.938 --> 08:27.440
Oh, I signed you up
for the hot-lunch program.

08:27.541 --> 08:30.177
(inhales sharply)
What is this place?

08:30.277 --> 08:31.879
Okay, I've been feeling
some pressure

08:31.979 --> 08:33.914
about what to do
after I graduate this year,

08:34.014 --> 08:36.216
and my parents are constantly
asking me about it.

08:36.316 --> 08:37.718
I thought that you were
going to work.

08:37.818 --> 08:41.622
So did I, but lately, I've been
questioning everything.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.423
I even thought
about becoming a fellow.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.959
(gasps) Ay, Alex,
that's a big change.

08:46.059 --> 08:48.528
But at least you get
to keep the same name.

08:48.629 --> 08:49.930
I'm not even sure
it's what I really want.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.198
Okay, you have to be
very sure,

08:51.298 --> 08:54.301
because I heard
it's even harder to reverse it.

08:54.401 --> 08:56.136
Can we talk about anything else?
Where's Joe?

08:56.236 --> 08:57.304
He started school today.

08:57.404 --> 09:00.107
He was so panicky
when I dropped him off.

09:00.207 --> 09:02.142
I don't know why.
It's just first grade.

09:02.242 --> 09:03.410
Just first grade?!

09:03.510 --> 09:04.645
That's when
the pressure starts!

09:04.745 --> 09:06.747
Ay!
You're freaking me out!

09:06.847 --> 09:10.250
Alex is going to be
a very nervous man.

09:10.350 --> 09:11.819
(indistinct conversations)

09:11.919 --> 09:13.821
Uh, e-excuse me,
sketch man.

09:13.921 --> 09:15.889
We'd like a word with you
about your little drawings.
Yes.

09:15.989 --> 09:17.958
You don't remember me,
do you?

09:18.058 --> 09:18.992
Uh...

09:19.092 --> 09:20.460
It's -- Um...

09:20.560 --> 09:22.963
Well, obviously,
we have offended you somehow.

09:23.063 --> 09:25.465
Oh, were you the barista
we had fired?

09:25.565 --> 09:28.802
Here's a hint -- I once stayed
in your upstairs rental.

09:28.936 --> 09:29.903
Oh.

09:30.003 --> 09:31.504
Who consumes
an entire welcome basket?

09:31.605 --> 09:33.573
We usually reuse
half this stuff.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.242
All the Altoids.
He was here one night.

09:35.342 --> 09:37.477
He -- He even ate
the horseradish mustard.

09:37.577 --> 09:38.612
What did he put it on?

09:38.712 --> 09:40.513
We purposely
don't give crackers.

09:40.614 --> 09:42.182
JONAH: Ugh!

09:43.416 --> 09:45.452
Hey.
Hey.

09:45.552 --> 09:47.755
We are so sorry
we offended you, but --

09:47.855 --> 09:49.456
Ooh, too late.

09:49.556 --> 09:50.523
I own you two.

09:50.624 --> 09:52.960
And I haven't even gotten
to my best stuff yet.

09:53.060 --> 09:54.662
I can go redder.

09:54.762 --> 09:56.363
You wouldn't.

09:56.463 --> 09:57.831
Just wait
till I connect the brows.

09:57.931 --> 09:58.832
Please.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.500
We have a child.

10:01.334 --> 10:03.637
Oh, fun --
a reporter from CNN.

10:03.737 --> 10:06.807
Looks like this pretty little
portrait's about to go national.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.976
Uh...
What --
What are we gonna do?

10:09.076 --> 10:10.543
Okay, is it just me,
or does this sound

10:10.644 --> 10:12.179
like a job
for Thesaurus Jones?

10:12.279 --> 10:14.047
It's just you.
No. Blackmail, Mitchell!

10:14.147 --> 10:16.549
We just have to dig
something up on this guy.

10:16.650 --> 10:20.120
Shouldn't be a problem, because
everyone's hiding something.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.321
Everyone.

10:21.421 --> 10:23.824
I feel like you're sitting
on one more...

10:23.924 --> 10:25.392
Everyone.
Yep.

10:27.194 --> 10:29.129
CLAIRE: (sighs shakily)
(hushed conversations)

10:29.229 --> 10:31.498
-(Clears throat)
-Shh! Shh! Shh!

10:31.598 --> 10:34.167
CLAIRE: Just as I feared,
my dad had crushed the spirit

10:34.267 --> 10:36.336
of everyone in that office.

10:36.436 --> 10:37.671
I had to do something to prove

10:37.771 --> 10:39.572
we weren't
some stuffy killjoys.

10:39.673 --> 10:41.909
It was time to bust out
Party Claire.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.010
(chuckles)

10:43.110 --> 10:45.245
She'd retired
after spring break '89.

10:45.345 --> 10:46.313
(sniffs)

10:46.413 --> 10:47.981
And again in '92.

10:49.349 --> 10:50.417
Hey,
do you have a second?

10:50.517 --> 10:52.252
If this is about
my respecting your process --

10:52.352 --> 10:54.888
Actually, we want to thank you
for laying down the law before.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.724
Because we have gone soft
as a company,

10:56.824 --> 10:58.358
we needed a couple grown-ups
to come in

10:58.458 --> 10:59.693
and put us
back on track.

10:59.793 --> 11:00.828
You know, thanks to you,

11:00.928 --> 11:02.062
we've gotten rid
of all the distractions --

11:02.162 --> 11:03.931
no more ping-pong tables,
squirt guns.

11:04.031 --> 11:06.066
The only thing we couldn't find
was that giant --

11:06.166 --> 11:07.868
CLAIRE:
Break time, bitches!

11:09.502 --> 11:11.004
Uh, it turns out
this is a little --

11:11.104 --> 11:12.572
Oh, my God!
The Thinfinity!

11:12.672 --> 11:13.573
I'm so sorry!

11:13.673 --> 11:15.442
Oh, my God!
I'm so sorry!

11:15.542 --> 11:16.944
I -- Oh!

11:17.044 --> 11:18.545
(creaking)

11:18.645 --> 11:19.947
(clatter)

11:20.047 --> 11:21.248
Sorry.

11:28.588 --> 11:30.690
Sketch boy
was unusually well-groomed

11:30.791 --> 11:34.061
for somebody coming out
of a government-subsidized gym.

11:34.161 --> 11:35.628
Something wasn't right.

11:35.729 --> 11:39.066
I was getting
that old Thesaurus Jones tingle.

11:39.166 --> 11:40.267
I decided to do
some sniffing around.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.534
(sniffs, exhales sharply)

11:41.634 --> 11:43.771
Sketch guy's face had
a kind of glow

11:43.871 --> 11:46.774
that can only be achieved with
expensive creams and unguents,

11:46.874 --> 11:50.243
yet all I found were packets
of cut-rate all-purpose lotions.

11:51.078 --> 11:53.814
According to my sources,
the gym had an executive level

11:53.914 --> 11:56.583
that provides all manner
of fancy spa products,

11:56.683 --> 11:58.819
but it's for judges
and attorneys only.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.453
I created a diversion

12:00.553 --> 12:02.122
by convincing
the security detail

12:02.222 --> 12:03.590
there was
a towel emergency...

12:03.690 --> 12:05.893
There's a towel
emergency.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.932
...and hacked
into the gym's computer system.

12:12.032 --> 12:15.435
Turns out he's been accessing
the executive level

12:15.535 --> 12:18.571
by swiping the ID
of one Victor Graham,

12:18.671 --> 12:20.407
a retired judge.

12:22.642 --> 12:23.811
MITCHELL:
Members of the jury,

12:23.911 --> 12:26.313
the defendant, Mr. Kane,
would have you believe

12:26.413 --> 12:29.282
that he was working
at the time of the crime.

12:29.382 --> 12:30.750
Bald?!

12:32.452 --> 12:33.586
...faced lies!

12:33.686 --> 12:35.488
(door opens)
Counselor?

12:35.588 --> 12:36.489
Ah.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.992
Because evidence
would clearly suggest

12:39.092 --> 12:41.661
that, um...

12:41.761 --> 12:42.629
Oh.

12:42.729 --> 12:43.964
...that while James Kane

12:44.064 --> 12:48.201
does have an office on
his company's executive floor,

12:48.301 --> 12:50.470
he was nowhere near it
that night.

12:50.570 --> 12:53.640
Nice try,
executive-level Jim.

12:55.542 --> 12:56.810
...Kane...

12:56.944 --> 12:58.311
we're onto you.

12:58.411 --> 13:02.682
Ladies and gentlemen,
before you've retired, judge...

13:03.783 --> 13:04.818
...for yourself

13:04.918 --> 13:09.289
and draw
a more accurate conclusion

13:09.389 --> 13:11.724
than the one Mr. Kane
would have you believe...

13:11.825 --> 13:14.161
Counselor,
you're speaking weirdly.

13:14.261 --> 13:17.030
I'm sure you will find
the defendant's alibi

13:17.130 --> 13:18.465
to be thin.

13:18.565 --> 13:20.233
(scribbling)

13:20.333 --> 13:21.334
Even thinner.

13:21.434 --> 13:23.403
(scribbling)

13:26.974 --> 13:27.875
(door opens)

13:27.975 --> 13:30.677
Good afternoon,
young Realtors.

13:30.777 --> 13:32.846
I have a very important
announcement

13:32.946 --> 13:34.147
to make after class,

13:34.247 --> 13:37.017
but in the meantime,
if you would be so kind

13:37.117 --> 13:39.219
as to open your books --

13:40.153 --> 13:41.721
(voice breaking)
Oh, boy. I can't do this.

13:41.821 --> 13:46.193
Students, today is
our last day together.

13:46.293 --> 13:47.895
(students murmuring)
Shh, shh.

13:47.995 --> 13:50.063
I've treasured
our time together.

13:50.163 --> 13:52.432
Brett, I know we got off
to a rough start,

13:52.532 --> 13:54.601
but once we broke down
those walls,

13:54.701 --> 13:56.336
I'm not sure
who was teaching who.

13:57.170 --> 14:00.073
Whitney, you're the toughest
single mother I know.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.942
Lucy, you be good to your mom.

14:03.076 --> 14:05.678
Bob, amazing how you battle
that dyslexia.

14:05.778 --> 14:08.181
Maybe ease off on the anger
toward your parents, though.

14:08.281 --> 14:10.017
They did you a solid
giving you that name.

14:10.117 --> 14:11.751
We're gonna miss you,
Mr. Nudphy.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.254
It's -- You -- You --
You flipped it, but...

14:14.354 --> 14:16.056
(voice breaking)
I'm gonna miss you guys, too.

14:16.156 --> 14:16.924
(sighs)

14:17.024 --> 14:20.627
Location. Location.
Location.

14:20.727 --> 14:22.195
You memorized it.

14:23.530 --> 14:27.200
Now, for the second
and last time...

14:27.300 --> 14:29.436
class dismissed.

14:31.704 --> 14:32.605
LUKE: Dad.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.274
Luke?

14:34.374 --> 14:35.943
How long
have you been back there?

14:36.043 --> 14:37.444
I pretty much saw
the whole thing.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.112
(sighs)

14:39.212 --> 14:40.247
Hey, Dad?

14:40.347 --> 14:42.149
Yeah?

14:42.249 --> 14:43.816
Don't forget
your coffee mug.

14:43.917 --> 14:45.085
O-Oh.

14:47.420 --> 14:49.422
I'm sure this all worked out
for the best.

14:49.522 --> 14:50.924
I'll, uh, probably miss

14:51.024 --> 14:53.760
a few spontaneous
Frisbee opportunities and...

14:53.860 --> 14:56.096
apparently,
a tumbling exchange program --

14:56.196 --> 14:57.597
oh, well --

14:57.697 --> 14:58.999
and an Amateur Inventors
Association.

14:59.099 --> 15:01.434
How much fun could it be
changing the world, anyway?

15:03.570 --> 15:05.939
"The Sequoia College
Players Present:

15:06.039 --> 15:09.276
A Hall and Oates
Magic Show."

15:10.310 --> 15:11.178
(car door opens)

15:11.278 --> 15:13.313
Dad, wait.
Yes, Luke?

15:13.413 --> 15:14.948
Don't forget your mug
again.

15:15.048 --> 15:16.449
Come on!

15:16.549 --> 15:18.485
Can't you see
I'm meant to be here?

15:18.585 --> 15:21.154
I'm sorry, but I've never
had a school to myself.

15:21.254 --> 15:24.291
I was always Alex's dumb brother
or Manny's hot nephew.

15:24.391 --> 15:27.527
Now I can finally
be my own person.

15:27.627 --> 15:29.129
I'm sorry. I get it.

15:29.229 --> 15:30.964
I-I r-- I-I really do.

15:31.064 --> 15:32.699
I think I was just getting
a little overexcited.

15:32.799 --> 15:34.767
I'll, uh...

15:34.867 --> 15:36.136
I'll see you at home.

15:38.205 --> 15:39.372
COACH WALLS: Dunphy.

15:39.472 --> 15:41.941
Glad I ran into you so I can
congratulate you personally.

15:42.042 --> 15:43.810
Wait.
I made the team?
First string.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.013
I got to say, your form
on that lineout lift

15:46.113 --> 15:47.847
(chuckles)
was impeccable.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.382
Thanks.
Yeah.

15:52.485 --> 15:55.055
(cellphone beeps)

15:55.155 --> 15:56.856
Hey, Dad.
I made the team.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.025
PHIL:
That's amazing!

15:58.125 --> 16:00.027
I knew you would.
You're a natural.

16:00.127 --> 16:01.694
Well,
I had a great teacher.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.030
Aww!

16:03.997 --> 16:05.332
So, listen.

16:05.432 --> 16:07.000
This is a big campus.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.568
Maybe we could both be here

16:08.668 --> 16:11.638
if we promise to stay
out of each other's way.
(tires screech)

16:11.738 --> 16:12.839
(engine revs)

16:12.939 --> 16:14.807
Well, I'd hate
to step on your toes.

16:14.907 --> 16:16.576
No, no, y-you wouldn't.

16:16.676 --> 16:17.710
(tires screech)
I would hate to stop you

16:17.810 --> 16:19.146
from doing something
you're so good at.

16:19.246 --> 16:20.747
I guess I could
think about it.

16:20.847 --> 16:23.583
I mean, it's not like
I'd be there all the time.

16:23.683 --> 16:26.686
I, uh, have class
and office hours,

16:26.786 --> 16:29.222
and I have the 11:00 a.m.
to 2:00 p.m. slot

16:29.322 --> 16:33.160
at the campus radio station
on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

16:33.260 --> 16:35.728
Hey, if you want
to be my sidekick...

16:36.563 --> 16:37.664
Dad?
You're right.

16:37.764 --> 16:39.232
It's better if I do
all the voices.

16:39.332 --> 16:40.600
What's up?!

16:43.203 --> 16:44.337
What's all this?

16:44.437 --> 16:47.207
Well, you got me so nervous
about Joe's terrible day

16:47.307 --> 16:49.909
that I put all this out
to cheer him up --

16:50.009 --> 16:51.444
sundae, video game.

16:51.544 --> 16:54.547
I even wrote him
a little pep talk.

16:54.647 --> 16:56.049
We're lucky to live
in the golden age of medicines.

16:56.149 --> 16:57.917
Hey, Grandpa, I'm staying here
for a couple of days,

16:58.017 --> 16:59.386
and I do not want
to talk about it.

16:59.486 --> 17:00.387
Cool.

17:00.487 --> 17:03.022
(doorbell rings)
(gasps) That's Joe.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.894
Hey, is my dad home?

17:07.994 --> 17:09.762
(whispering) Crap.
What is my mom doing here?

17:09.862 --> 17:11.264
Come with me.

17:11.364 --> 17:12.599
I owe him an apology.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.934
I made a huge scene
at work.

17:15.034 --> 17:18.371
Well, sometimes
the best way to say "I'm sorry"

17:18.471 --> 17:19.706
is in an e-mail.

17:19.806 --> 17:24.211
Why don't you write him
at JaysComputerMail@aol.com?

17:24.311 --> 17:27.247
(voice breaking)
I plowed over a bunch of people
in a giant hamster ball.

17:27.347 --> 17:29.316
And then I tried
to impress the foodies

17:29.416 --> 17:30.817
by ordering Indian
for lunch.

17:30.917 --> 17:31.951
And then I chewed some gum

17:32.051 --> 17:33.653
to get rid
of my coriander breath,

17:33.753 --> 17:35.588
and I'm pretty sure
some's in my hair.

17:35.688 --> 17:37.324
And then I -- Oh --

17:37.424 --> 17:39.659
tripped and fell
and skinned my knee,

17:39.759 --> 17:41.628
and everybody saw
my underwear.

17:41.728 --> 17:42.629
(door opens)

17:42.729 --> 17:43.763
Crushed it!

17:43.863 --> 17:45.798
First days are easy
when you're cool.

17:45.898 --> 17:46.766
Uh-huh.

17:46.866 --> 17:48.601
I do feel bad
for Conner B.

17:48.701 --> 17:51.471
He brought stinky egg salad
for lunch.

17:51.571 --> 17:54.341
He's gonna have to eat
with the nurse.

17:54.441 --> 17:55.642
Oh, God!
Ay.

17:55.742 --> 17:58.178
Uh, Joe,
why don't you go upstairs?

17:58.278 --> 17:59.279
Ugh.

17:59.379 --> 18:00.947
I just want to go back
to my old office,

18:01.047 --> 18:02.415
where I had friends.

18:02.515 --> 18:03.683
I know.

18:03.783 --> 18:04.651
Sometimes...
(sighs)

18:04.751 --> 18:08.255
...you know,
we all have bad days.

18:09.322 --> 18:10.790
And...(Sighs)

18:10.890 --> 18:15.795
And sometimes, we have to --
to deal with mean boys.

18:15.895 --> 18:17.130
Boys are mean.

18:17.230 --> 18:18.831
You're right, Gloria.

18:18.931 --> 18:19.866
I am right?

18:19.966 --> 18:21.100
Mm.

18:21.201 --> 18:23.870
Oh, you know what I love
about this family?

18:23.970 --> 18:24.937
Mnh-mnh.

18:25.037 --> 18:28.208
We're not quitters --
especially you.

18:28.308 --> 18:33.012
Remember how hard it was
for you to learn how to swim?

18:33.112 --> 18:34.481
It wa hard.

18:35.282 --> 18:38.117
But now it's your favorite thing
in the world

18:38.218 --> 18:42.189
because it reminds you
of how strong you are.

18:42.289 --> 18:44.023
I mean,
I like to swim...

18:44.123 --> 18:45.992
Tomorrow can
only be better.

18:46.092 --> 18:47.059
Mm.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.695
But just in case,
I'll come at lunch,

18:48.795 --> 18:51.631
and I will kiss you
through the fence.

18:52.365 --> 18:54.066
How about I text you
around 11:00

18:54.167 --> 18:55.335
and let you know
how I'm doing?

18:55.435 --> 18:58.405
So, you want to tell me
why you're avoiding your mom?

18:58.505 --> 18:59.372
I'm not avoiding her.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.308
Hey, what's --
what's all this?

19:01.408 --> 19:03.876
Danger O'Shea memorabilia.
I'm a big collector.

19:03.976 --> 19:04.977
Who's Danger O'Shea?

19:05.077 --> 19:06.313
Legendary daredevil.

19:06.413 --> 19:09.081
Got famous for jumping over
a school bus on his motorcycle.

19:09.182 --> 19:10.550
Get over here!
Talk to me.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.485
Tell me why
you're avoiding your mom.

19:12.585 --> 19:13.753
Okay.

19:13.853 --> 19:16.389
Well, I've been on
a science track my whole life,

19:16.489 --> 19:18.725
which my parents love --
"Alex the scientist."

19:18.825 --> 19:21.728
But...lately, I've been
having second thoughts.

19:21.828 --> 19:24.697
I've always loved singing,
and -- and I've been doing

19:24.797 --> 19:26.433
some open-mic nights
recently,

19:26.533 --> 19:28.235
and it's been going
really well.

19:28.335 --> 19:30.437
I see where this is going.
Sing for me.

19:30.537 --> 19:32.505
What, like...right now?

19:32.605 --> 19:33.940
Just sing.

19:36.042 --> 19:41.013
* Somewhere
over the rainbow *

19:41.113 --> 19:43.583
* Skies are blue

19:43.683 --> 19:45.518
That was great.

19:46.953 --> 19:48.221
Stick to science.

19:48.321 --> 19:51.190
Wow. You really got a knack
for pep talks in this house.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.393
I'm not saying
it's impossible.

19:53.493 --> 19:54.594
I'm saying play the odds.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.696
For example,
you take this O'Shea guy.

19:56.796 --> 19:58.931
Oh, good.
We're back to him.
But he was smart.

19:59.031 --> 20:01.701
He started a business,
got established.

20:01.801 --> 20:03.536
And when he couldn't kick
the daredevil dream,

20:03.636 --> 20:04.637
he went for it.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.406
And he was good --
real good --

20:06.506 --> 20:08.040
until that fateful day
he tried to jump

20:08.140 --> 20:10.943
over a motorcycle
in a school bus.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.446
Fortunately for him,
unlike his act,

20:13.546 --> 20:14.547
he had a safety net.

20:14.647 --> 20:16.816
His business.
Jumped right back in.

20:16.916 --> 20:18.150
Within a year,
it was bigger than ever.

20:18.251 --> 20:20.920
The point is, you've been on
the science track for 15 years.

20:21.020 --> 20:23.723
See it through.
Build a foundation.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.792
If in a couple of years,
you still have the singing bug,

20:25.892 --> 20:26.793
go for it!

20:26.893 --> 20:28.395
I guess you're right.

20:28.495 --> 20:30.062
It would be pretty dumb
of me

20:30.162 --> 20:31.898
to give up
on the career path I'm on.

20:31.998 --> 20:34.401
I could make half a mil
my first year out of school.

20:34.501 --> 20:36.269
Wow!
What do they pay men?

20:36.369 --> 20:37.570
(scoffs)

20:38.738 --> 20:41.408
So, Danger never did
another stunt again?

20:41.508 --> 20:44.176
He still brings that maverick
spirit to everything he does,

20:44.277 --> 20:45.912
which is why he got
to the top of his industry.

20:46.012 --> 20:49.482
Some people think
it's the greatest stunt
he ever pulled off.

20:49.582 --> 20:50.683
(scoffs)

20:50.783 --> 20:53.152
Thanks for the talk...

20:53.252 --> 20:54.854
Danger.

20:57.957 --> 21:00.593
So, I won my case,
and even better,

21:00.693 --> 21:03.363
this is going up
at The Side Bar.
Yeah.

21:03.463 --> 21:05.031
And now maybe
you'll have some respect

21:05.131 --> 21:06.299
for my investigative
skills.

21:06.399 --> 21:09.001
It was a pretty simple case,
because, as I've said,

21:09.101 --> 21:12.171
everyone has
something to hide.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.673
Everyone.

21:23.516 --> 21:25.952
You know --
Everyone.

21:28.855 --> 21:31.123
