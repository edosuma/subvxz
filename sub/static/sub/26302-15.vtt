00:00.807 --> 00:02.449
Previously on Empire...

00:02.473 --> 00:03.746
I'm here for you

00:03.747 --> 00:04.914
if ever you need to talk.

00:06.483 --> 00:07.627
I can tell you like her,

00:07.651 --> 00:08.818
and she's into you, too.

00:08.818 --> 00:11.921
- Are you drinking alone?
- I hope not.

00:11.922 --> 00:15.791
When Cookie met Lucious,
I lost everything.

00:15.792 --> 00:17.293
You are my son.

00:17.294 --> 00:19.395
I took the thing that you value most,

00:19.396 --> 00:21.040
and I made it better
than you ever could.

00:21.064 --> 00:22.932
I need you to believe me right now.

00:22.933 --> 00:26.769
The only thing I have energy for
is for caring for Andre.

00:26.770 --> 00:28.771
We need to immediately
start you on chemo.

00:28.772 --> 00:30.039
We treat it aggressively.

00:32.308 --> 00:36.545
Andre has been battling lymphoma

00:36.546 --> 00:40.182
for the past six weeks.

00:40.183 --> 00:43.185
And... in a couple of days,

00:43.186 --> 00:46.122
the doctors are gonna let us know

00:46.123 --> 00:47.857
if he's winning that battle.

00:47.858 --> 00:50.124
But I believe in something

00:50.125 --> 00:52.393
mightier than medicine.

00:54.663 --> 00:58.031
I believe in the power of God.

00:58.033 --> 01:00.434
Amen.

01:00.435 --> 01:04.405
So, let's lift my Andre

01:04.406 --> 01:09.076
and the entire Lyon family up
in prayer

01:09.077 --> 01:11.578
and welcome Pastor Brown.

01:13.000 --> 01:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:23.892 --> 01:25.893
God is good. Amen?

01:25.894 --> 01:27.428
Yes.

01:27.429 --> 01:29.730
Thank you, Sister Teri.

01:29.731 --> 01:32.399
As we pray for Andre,

01:32.400 --> 01:35.469
let us all remember
that the Lord is ever-gracious.

01:35.470 --> 01:38.405
Ever-loving.

01:38.406 --> 01:43.076
And He asks you to make peace
with foe and friend alike

01:43.078 --> 01:45.646
to make room for His healing.

01:45.647 --> 01:47.848
Put your house in order,

01:47.849 --> 01:50.050
and let God work in your life.

01:50.051 --> 01:52.719
Amen.

01:52.721 --> 01:54.221
And now,

01:54.222 --> 01:58.659
Tina Jenkins Crawley
will lead us in song.

04:10.225 --> 04:12.225
You look good, baby.

04:12.227 --> 04:15.262
I've been dealing with cancer
for six weeks, Ma. You...

04:15.263 --> 04:17.363
you don't have to lie to me.

04:17.365 --> 04:19.433
You still have your hair.
That should...

04:19.434 --> 04:20.968
that should be a good sign, right?

04:22.637 --> 04:24.871
I was just telling Andre

04:24.873 --> 04:27.541
the entire church is praying for him.

04:27.542 --> 04:30.644
And Andre,

04:30.645 --> 04:32.646
you would've been so proud
of Teri today.

04:32.647 --> 04:35.415
You were absolutely amazing.

04:37.619 --> 04:39.129
Baby, you want me to make you a plate?

04:39.153 --> 04:41.321
I'm-I'm not hungry, Ma. Thanks.

04:43.124 --> 04:44.858
I got him, Cookie.

04:44.859 --> 04:46.994
Okay. Well, we'll be just upstairs.

04:46.995 --> 04:48.195
All right, baby?

04:48.196 --> 04:50.430
If you need anything...

04:50.431 --> 04:52.599
I love you.

04:53.468 --> 04:56.003
I love you, too, Ma.

05:03.945 --> 05:06.079
I'm starting to think that...

05:06.080 --> 05:08.982
maybe that preacher was right.

05:08.983 --> 05:10.784
"Preacher" and "right."

05:10.785 --> 05:14.321
Two words I never thought
you'd use in the same sentence.

05:14.322 --> 05:16.056
No, I'm serious, honey.

05:16.057 --> 05:19.259
Maybe we need
to get our house in order.

05:19.260 --> 05:22.062
You know, maybe if I made peace
with Kingsley,

05:22.063 --> 05:24.598
maybe the karma would turn around

05:24.599 --> 05:26.243
and things could work out well
for Andre.

05:26.267 --> 05:29.302
Okay, if you think
that will save Andre

05:29.304 --> 05:32.472
or unburden your soul,
then do it, Lucious.

05:33.408 --> 05:35.842
Look, baby, I know that...

05:35.843 --> 05:38.612
that it's been really hard lately,

05:38.613 --> 05:42.182
but... it's getting better,

05:42.183 --> 05:43.950
I promise you.

05:43.952 --> 05:47.054
- We might lose Andre.
- Don't-don't you say that.

05:47.055 --> 05:49.556
You got to stop
saying stuff like that!

05:49.557 --> 05:51.825
I don't know what to do.

05:51.826 --> 05:53.593
Lucious, I feel helpless.

05:53.595 --> 05:55.328
No, you've got to be positive.

05:55.330 --> 05:57.931
You cannot have
all these negative thoughts

05:57.932 --> 06:00.333
about our son.

06:06.240 --> 06:09.943
So I got to sit here

06:09.944 --> 06:14.548
and listen to you go on and on
about Kingsley.

06:18.987 --> 06:22.255
But you can't hear how I feel?

06:24.158 --> 06:28.261
No, what I'm saying is
all your fears about Andre,

06:28.262 --> 06:30.430
that ain't helping you or me.

06:30.431 --> 06:33.033
- I mean, we got to be positive.
- I got to go.

06:33.034 --> 06:36.236
- I-I don't have time for this.
- Now where you going?

06:36.237 --> 06:39.072
I, got to meet with Carol.
We got to talk

06:39.073 --> 06:41.308
about phase two of the Trust Tour.

06:42.644 --> 06:44.478
Look, this is me being positive, okay?

06:44.479 --> 06:46.213
I'm going back to work.

06:52.787 --> 06:54.821
Babe.

06:56.624 --> 06:58.058
Wow, dang.

06:58.059 --> 06:59.336
All right. All right.

06:59.360 --> 07:00.940
All right.

07:04.732 --> 07:06.043
Damn, babe. What's the...

07:06.067 --> 07:07.734
I missed you, too. What's the rush?

07:07.735 --> 07:09.369
Well, I'm only in town for two days,

07:09.370 --> 07:11.371
and you have a tour to get back to.

07:11.372 --> 07:12.906
I know.

07:14.575 --> 07:16.443
You forgot, didn't you?

07:17.478 --> 07:20.347
Come on, babe. Check your calendar.

07:20.348 --> 07:24.851
We haven't been... together in weeks.

07:26.521 --> 07:28.155
Sex date.

07:28.156 --> 07:30.524
Boom. Sex date.

07:30.525 --> 07:32.659
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

07:32.660 --> 07:34.261
I just got a lot going on right now.

07:34.262 --> 07:35.562
Give me a second, all right?

07:35.563 --> 07:37.030
The tour, you know,

07:37.031 --> 07:39.432
it's really good, it's just...

07:39.434 --> 07:41.635
I don't know, I just...

07:41.636 --> 07:44.805
feel like I want to shake it up
or something, you know?

07:44.806 --> 07:46.706
How'd the tux fittings go?

07:46.708 --> 07:48.608
Y-You're on tux duty, babe.

07:48.609 --> 07:50.010
No, I'm not, Kai.

07:50.011 --> 07:52.345
Did you even look at the spreadsheet

07:52.346 --> 07:54.014
I spent hours on?

07:56.884 --> 07:59.619
I just heard myself, and I sound

07:59.620 --> 08:02.455
like freakin' groomzilla. I'm sorry.

08:04.525 --> 08:07.060
- Did I kill the mood?
- Absolutely not.

08:07.061 --> 08:10.063
Besides, I have been dreaming

08:10.064 --> 08:11.864
- of kissing your neck all day.
- There it is.

08:20.475 --> 08:22.809
You know,
the sex date is off the chain.

08:39.559 --> 08:41.995
I'm glad you called.
It's good to see you.

08:41.996 --> 08:44.197
It's good to see you, too.

08:44.198 --> 08:45.699
Come in.

08:45.700 --> 08:47.320
I'm just about finished making dinner.

08:57.145 --> 08:59.646
I have given you weeks
to think about it.

08:59.647 --> 09:02.182
We need an answer.

09:03.451 --> 09:05.552
Lucious and I don't exactly play catch

09:05.553 --> 09:07.120
in the park on Sundays.

09:07.121 --> 09:09.155
If I turn up all of a sudden
out of nowhere,

09:09.157 --> 09:10.267
he's gonna know something's up.

09:10.291 --> 09:12.058
Lyon is a street hustler.

09:12.059 --> 09:13.827
He will always think something's up.

09:13.828 --> 09:16.396
And you're smarter. Aren't you?

09:16.397 --> 09:19.165
I mean, at least that's
what you've been telling me.

09:19.167 --> 09:20.967
Convince him otherwise.

09:24.539 --> 09:26.239
This...

09:26.240 --> 09:28.942
is a recording device.

09:28.943 --> 09:30.510
You're gonna put it on,

09:30.511 --> 09:32.422
and then you're gonna have
a conversation with your dad

09:32.446 --> 09:33.980
about how he recently got

09:33.981 --> 09:35.782
a large sum of money out of Panama

09:35.783 --> 09:37.517
with the help of Damon Cross.

09:37.518 --> 09:40.320
You expect me to wear a wire,
just like that?

09:40.321 --> 09:42.455
No.

09:42.456 --> 09:44.958
You're under no obligation.

09:44.959 --> 09:46.993
But if you want to have
the satisfaction

09:46.994 --> 09:48.872
of knowing that you're the one
who took down Lucious Lyon

09:48.896 --> 09:51.831
for everything he did to you
and your mother,

09:51.833 --> 09:54.134
then you'll help us.

10:03.678 --> 10:06.846
Show me how this thing works.

10:07.748 --> 10:13.616
_ _

10:16.890 --> 10:19.692
And now he wants to bring
Kingsley back into our lives.

10:19.693 --> 10:21.027
Now?

10:21.028 --> 10:22.595
Not the best timing.

10:22.596 --> 10:24.697
He asking a lot of you.

10:25.866 --> 10:27.900
Well, that and...

10:30.270 --> 10:32.405
what Andre is going through.

10:34.908 --> 10:37.643
I'm trying to keep it together,
but sometimes...

10:37.644 --> 10:39.278
You can't.

10:39.279 --> 10:40.813
And that's okay.

10:40.814 --> 10:43.282
You know,
what you're feeling is normal.

10:45.619 --> 10:48.020
Terrified, guilty, useless...

10:48.021 --> 10:49.889
all of that is normal?

10:49.890 --> 10:53.059
Yes. When your child's facing a
situation like this, absolutely.

10:53.060 --> 10:56.929
That's what I felt
when my daughter was sick.

11:00.367 --> 11:02.902
Lucious say we got to be strong,

11:02.903 --> 11:05.438
got to stay tough.

11:05.439 --> 11:07.473
That's not enough
for a person like you.

11:07.474 --> 11:09.275
You know how I got through it?

11:09.276 --> 11:12.278
I had to stop being a tough guy.

11:12.279 --> 11:15.181
I didn't stuff down my fear.

11:15.182 --> 11:17.283
I let myself feel it.

11:17.284 --> 11:20.453
I had to... I had to feel it
for my baby girl.

11:20.454 --> 11:23.155
I needed to.

11:26.526 --> 11:29.428
Lucious won't let me say it, but...

11:31.031 --> 11:33.632
I can't bury my son, Damon.

11:33.634 --> 11:36.002
Cookie, just feel it.

11:37.437 --> 11:40.606
You know, you can't run away from it.

11:52.219 --> 11:54.253
Thank you.

11:55.222 --> 11:57.189
You know how we do.

11:57.190 --> 11:59.592
I'm always gonna be here for you.

11:59.593 --> 12:01.861
Always.

12:18.445 --> 12:20.646
I wish that you were

12:20.647 --> 12:23.182
at my counseling session...

12:23.183 --> 12:25.051
with Pastor Brown.

12:26.320 --> 12:28.988
Did you talk about me?

12:30.357 --> 12:31.490
We did.

12:33.327 --> 12:36.695
So you want to have
the God talk now?

12:42.903 --> 12:44.904
If you're up for it.

12:44.905 --> 12:47.807
I'm glad you have the church
to lean on, Teri.

12:49.776 --> 12:52.945
I don't feel the same way
about God that you do.

12:53.947 --> 12:56.082
You don't believe?

12:56.083 --> 12:58.217
I believe in God.

13:00.354 --> 13:02.154
In fact, many lifetimes ago,

13:02.155 --> 13:05.057
me and God... were boys.

13:06.893 --> 13:09.762
So what changed?

13:09.763 --> 13:11.430
I loved Him.

13:14.968 --> 13:17.470
He repaid that love with punishment,

13:17.471 --> 13:21.140
time and time again.

13:23.677 --> 13:28.013
Andre, God doesn't punish.

13:28.015 --> 13:31.117
- God can test us.
- No, God didn't

13:31.118 --> 13:34.553
just test me, this was
more than a test, Teri.

13:34.554 --> 13:36.622
This was personal.

13:38.558 --> 13:40.993
I'm sure that wasn't the case.

13:49.036 --> 13:51.504
God took my wife.

13:53.473 --> 13:56.041
God took my son.

13:59.980 --> 14:03.349
There's nothing
that God can do for me,

14:03.350 --> 14:07.153
because I don't want nothing
to do with God, Teri.

14:07.154 --> 14:09.922
You're gonna have to accept that.

14:12.993 --> 14:15.661
No.

14:15.662 --> 14:17.863
I can't.

14:22.102 --> 14:24.937
But I can drop it...

14:24.938 --> 14:26.539
for now.

14:28.475 --> 14:31.010
Thank you.

14:42.956 --> 14:44.690
Hey, little lady.

14:46.760 --> 14:48.093
I didn't know we had

14:48.095 --> 14:51.163
a-a "drop by unannounced"
type relationship.

14:51.164 --> 14:53.899
- Excuse me.
- What do you want, Lucious?

14:53.900 --> 14:56.235
Last time you dropped by
you spent the time

14:56.236 --> 14:58.103
- denying your own son.
- No.

14:58.105 --> 15:00.239
I stopped by to ask you about the son

15:00.240 --> 15:03.108
that you never told me I had.

15:03.110 --> 15:04.910
So what?

15:04.911 --> 15:07.146
Now, all of a sudden, you feel like

15:07.147 --> 15:09.281
being his dad after all?

15:10.851 --> 15:13.485
Look, Tracy, I didn't come here
to argue with you

15:13.487 --> 15:15.988
about something that happened
35 years ago.

15:15.989 --> 15:19.992
Why not? I'm still paying for
what you did to me 35 years ago.

15:19.993 --> 15:21.860
What I did to you?

15:21.862 --> 15:24.096
What did I do to you?

15:24.097 --> 15:25.864
Tell me.

15:27.567 --> 15:28.968
You know.

15:28.969 --> 15:31.270
All I know is some story Jeff told me

15:31.271 --> 15:34.073
about you bringing him to my house.

15:34.074 --> 15:36.809
I mean, back at a time
I couldn't even remember.

15:36.810 --> 15:38.644
I wanted you to know your son.

15:38.645 --> 15:42.514
You wanted me to know my son
that you never told me I had.

15:42.516 --> 15:45.251
And now you blaming me for that.

15:46.620 --> 15:48.654
Or you blaming me for all of this?

15:48.655 --> 15:50.889
- All of it. It's all your fault.
- My fault?

15:50.891 --> 15:53.659
You were the one that got cracked out.

15:55.395 --> 15:58.697
You turned my son into my enemy.

15:58.698 --> 16:01.867
You made me the bad guy
'cause you couldn't deal

16:01.868 --> 16:03.636
with your own crap.

16:03.637 --> 16:05.371
And you told him those lies.

16:09.943 --> 16:12.778
Look... Tracy,

16:12.779 --> 16:14.913
I didn't come here

16:14.915 --> 16:18.484
to try and rewrite or fix our past.

16:18.485 --> 16:20.352
I just want to make

16:20.353 --> 16:23.689
a better future for our son.

16:23.690 --> 16:26.392
Okay? I just want to have

16:26.393 --> 16:29.628
a relationship with my son.

16:35.602 --> 16:38.537
We were so fly back then.

16:40.974 --> 16:43.309
You always dressed so fresh,

16:43.310 --> 16:46.245
and I was that cute white girl
who could dance.

16:50.116 --> 16:52.318
You know, I used to dream
that we'd get married

16:52.319 --> 16:55.821
and have a baby and move
into a big house.

16:59.859 --> 17:02.027
One out of three ain't bad, right?

17:07.867 --> 17:10.868
Tracy.

17:13.440 --> 17:16.141
I'm asking you...

17:16.142 --> 17:18.977
to help build a bridge

17:18.979 --> 17:22.348
between me and my son.

17:26.118 --> 17:28.687
I'm saying please.

17:28.688 --> 17:30.923
It's gonna be his decision.

17:33.093 --> 17:34.927
But I'll talk to him.

17:34.928 --> 17:38.030
Thank you.

17:38.031 --> 17:39.965
Thank you.

18:03.484 --> 18:05.885
Hey, Keem.

18:05.886 --> 18:07.753
Hakeem. Um...

18:07.754 --> 18:10.056
There we go. Hi.

18:10.057 --> 18:13.226
So, I need a favor.

18:13.227 --> 18:15.094
Talk to me.

18:15.095 --> 18:17.163
All right. So...

18:17.164 --> 18:19.465
Devon has finally finished his album,

18:19.466 --> 18:21.611
and, honestly, it's incredible,
and even more honestly,

18:21.635 --> 18:23.736
I had a lot to do with that, so...

18:25.305 --> 18:27.306
you know, thank you,

18:27.307 --> 18:28.941
but I was thinking

18:28.942 --> 18:31.310
what better way

18:31.311 --> 18:33.913
to introduce Devon to the fans

18:33.914 --> 18:35.481
than through you.

18:35.482 --> 18:37.083
Nah.

18:39.353 --> 18:41.354
Hi! I'm still here.

18:41.355 --> 18:42.922
Why not?

18:42.923 --> 18:45.057
- Because I brought Blake out.
- So?

18:45.058 --> 18:46.892
And that "solid" brought us
a lot of drama.

18:46.894 --> 18:48.494
So nah.

18:50.097 --> 18:51.998
All right, first of all...

18:51.999 --> 18:53.766
Devon is not Blake,

18:53.767 --> 18:56.502
and secondly, that drama
was all you and you know it.

18:56.503 --> 18:58.104
See, here you go again.

18:58.105 --> 19:00.106
I need to focus on myself these days.

19:00.107 --> 19:02.508
How is that different
than any other day?

19:09.082 --> 19:10.816
We're done here.

19:10.817 --> 19:13.252
All right, well, thanks a lot.

19:21.728 --> 19:23.896
Good morning, Cook.

19:23.897 --> 19:25.642
So I'm guessing you got
my check ready, right?

19:25.666 --> 19:27.566
What the hell check
are you talking about?

19:27.568 --> 19:29.201
Is Lucious around?

19:29.203 --> 19:31.437
No, Lucious ain't here,
he left already. Why?

19:31.438 --> 19:34.106
Honey, you know he had the nerve
to call me looking for you?

19:34.107 --> 19:36.676
Apparently, you and I are doing
phase two of the tour.

19:36.677 --> 19:38.878
No, just relax.

19:38.879 --> 19:41.013
Relax, though, I didn't say nothing.

19:41.014 --> 19:43.049
Thank God.

19:43.050 --> 19:45.751
Honey, don't thank God, thank me.

19:45.752 --> 19:47.620
Is this about the guy
that you were with?

19:47.621 --> 19:49.889
Sis, I thought he was one and done.

19:49.890 --> 19:52.792
We're not sleeping together,
okay, so relax.

19:52.793 --> 19:55.594
So then why you got me covering
for your non-cheating ass?

19:55.596 --> 19:57.730
Because... because I've had a...

19:57.731 --> 19:59.632
a friendship for six weeks,

19:59.633 --> 20:02.535
and that Lucious wouldn't understand.

20:02.536 --> 20:04.804
Well, you have my full attention.

20:05.772 --> 20:07.807
Damon Cross has been
helping me get through

20:07.808 --> 20:09.942
since Andre got sick, okay?

20:09.943 --> 20:11.711
Well, what about me or your husband?

20:11.712 --> 20:13.512
- We can't help you get through?
- Look,

20:13.513 --> 20:16.849
Damon understands because
his daughter battled cancer,

20:16.850 --> 20:18.294
so he knows what I'm going through.

20:18.318 --> 20:20.386
And Lucious...

20:20.387 --> 20:22.021
he won't hear me.

20:22.022 --> 20:23.489
Damon is different.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.425
Sis, I think the only difference is

20:26.426 --> 20:30.062
is that you're not sleeping
with him yet.

20:30.063 --> 20:31.731
I mean, you're really not, right?

20:31.732 --> 20:35.134
Everybody ain't a ho like you,
Carol, okay?

20:35.135 --> 20:36.302
No, I'm not.

20:36.303 --> 20:37.837
I love Lucious.

20:37.838 --> 20:41.273
He's just not giving me
what I need right now.

20:42.209 --> 20:44.543
All right, sis, do you.

20:44.544 --> 20:46.746
But I'm telling you, if you're
lying to your husband,

20:46.747 --> 20:48.814
and leaning on another man,
that right there

20:48.815 --> 20:50.916
is a threat to your marriage.

20:54.921 --> 20:57.990
Everything looks clean, you know?

20:59.192 --> 21:01.227
How you holding up?

21:01.228 --> 21:02.661
What's the word on Andre?

21:02.663 --> 21:04.463
I don't know. Man, they've been

21:04.464 --> 21:06.276
talking about, well, maybe they
were gonna get some good news

21:06.300 --> 21:07.600
in a couple days.

21:07.601 --> 21:09.268
He'll be all right. He's strong.

21:09.269 --> 21:10.870
Hey, Lucious.

21:10.871 --> 21:12.438
Kingsley.

21:13.373 --> 21:15.841
Damn. Glad to see you.

21:15.842 --> 21:17.543
Look who's back.

21:17.544 --> 21:19.178
The runt of the litter.

21:19.179 --> 21:20.846
Thirsty.

21:21.782 --> 21:24.550
Lucious, could I talk to you
for a second in private?

21:24.551 --> 21:26.719
Absolutely.

21:26.720 --> 21:28.954
- Make some room.
- Are you serious?

21:28.955 --> 21:30.900
- You're damn right I'm serious.
- All right.

21:30.924 --> 21:33.069
You might need your lawyer.
I still think you need to take

21:33.093 --> 21:35.227
a DNA test for the forgotten son here.

21:35.228 --> 21:36.796
I'm so glad

21:36.797 --> 21:40.499
you came, man. It's really good
to see you, son.

21:42.002 --> 21:43.202
You want a drink?

21:43.203 --> 21:44.437
Yeah.

21:47.874 --> 21:50.443
- Dark or light?
- Dark, please.

22:02.523 --> 22:05.445
- Thank you for seeing me.
- Man, I figured

22:05.446 --> 22:09.115
you weren't here to try
and erase my music again.

22:10.451 --> 22:12.018
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

22:12.019 --> 22:13.553
I was being...

22:13.554 --> 22:15.788
vindictive and emotional.

22:15.789 --> 22:17.590
But you're here now, right?

22:17.591 --> 22:18.925
We're good.

22:20.494 --> 22:22.695
Congratulations on the Trust Tour.

22:22.696 --> 22:24.264
Brilliant move.

22:24.265 --> 22:27.755
Well, I had to handle a few repairs

22:27.756 --> 22:29.145
with the fans,

22:29.146 --> 22:30.225
especially after all the mess

22:30.226 --> 22:32.828
we all made around here,
you know what I mean?

22:32.829 --> 22:35.664
Again, that's my fault.

22:35.665 --> 22:38.233
And for whatever
it's worth, I'm sorry.

22:38.234 --> 22:40.783
Wow. Hey, I thought
you would come here

22:40.784 --> 22:44.153
expecting me to do
a whole lot of apologizing.

22:44.154 --> 22:45.721
Apologize for what?

22:45.723 --> 22:47.824
For... for abandoning me?

22:47.825 --> 22:49.192
No.

22:49.193 --> 22:51.227
- Doing crack with my mom?
- No, no, no,

22:51.228 --> 22:54.497
no, I can't apologize
for something I never did, son.

22:54.498 --> 22:56.432
I was a hustler.

22:56.433 --> 22:59.368
But I never used any of that stuff.

22:59.370 --> 23:00.803
I wasn't that foolish.

23:00.804 --> 23:02.863
- Really?
- Really.

23:02.864 --> 23:05.198
Never touched the stuff.

23:05.199 --> 23:07.968
Well, I just wanted
to congratulate you

23:07.969 --> 23:09.546
on pulling off the impossible.

23:09.570 --> 23:11.204
Empire's back from near death.

23:11.205 --> 23:13.373
Yeah, it's hard to kill a Lyon.

23:13.374 --> 23:15.242
King of the jungle,

23:15.243 --> 23:17.277
master of the universe, right?

23:18.412 --> 23:19.713
Lucious...

23:19.714 --> 23:22.382
I could learn a lot from you.

23:23.317 --> 23:25.685
I mean, this-this last deal
that you did...

23:26.587 --> 23:28.088
was a master class.

23:30.925 --> 23:32.626
My last deal?

23:32.627 --> 23:34.761
No, I mean, you obviously,

23:34.762 --> 23:37.330
raised a lot of money
to fund the tour.

23:37.331 --> 23:39.232
The tour.

23:39.233 --> 23:41.468
No offense, but nobody's giving Empire

23:41.469 --> 23:43.803
any loans right now, though, so...

23:43.805 --> 23:46.539
cash infusion or...

23:46.541 --> 23:49.276
overseas money?

23:49.277 --> 23:52.746
No, maybe a personal contact,
a f-a friend,

23:52.747 --> 23:54.681
so no stock changes hands.

23:54.682 --> 23:57.817
I'm in awe of you, Lucious.

23:57.819 --> 23:59.552
Truly.

24:02.089 --> 24:04.190
I meant what I said.

24:05.359 --> 24:07.994
I'm sorry for what I did.

24:07.995 --> 24:09.763
Honestly.

24:09.764 --> 24:12.666
Yeah. You've said that a few times.

24:17.038 --> 24:20.173
Y... Your mama didn't
tell you to come here?

24:21.676 --> 24:22.876
My mom?

24:22.877 --> 24:24.978
No, this is all me.

24:31.419 --> 24:33.420
Damn.

24:35.223 --> 24:37.657
Excuse me. You know what,
we're gonna have to...

24:37.658 --> 24:39.759
cut this a little short.

24:41.829 --> 24:44.931
I just realized I got a fire
I need to put out.

24:44.932 --> 24:46.800
Right now?

24:46.801 --> 24:48.668
Yeah. Um...

24:48.669 --> 24:51.638
Hey, get Thirst back in here!

24:51.639 --> 24:54.874
You and me, um,
why don't we get together,

24:54.876 --> 24:57.177
like, later on, you know,

24:57.178 --> 24:58.845
have a bite to eat or something?

24:58.846 --> 25:00.180
Sounds great.

25:00.181 --> 25:02.015
It's good seeing you, son.

25:02.950 --> 25:04.884
Likewise.

25:07.722 --> 25:10.323
What did the hellspawn want?

25:13.761 --> 25:15.462
You all right?

25:16.764 --> 25:18.765
I don't know.

25:18.766 --> 25:20.500
I mean, he started off

25:20.501 --> 25:23.570
asking all these questions about...

25:23.571 --> 25:26.406
our financing the tour.

25:29.677 --> 25:32.545
I think he's working
with the Feds, man.

25:32.546 --> 25:34.948
He in here trying to set me up.

25:40.755 --> 25:42.288
So...

25:42.290 --> 25:44.424
although the lymphoma
is not in remission

25:44.425 --> 25:47.127
you've been responding really
well to the treatments, Andre.

25:47.128 --> 25:49.662
At six weeks, I'd hope so.

25:49.664 --> 25:51.308
So, does that mean that the cancer

25:51.332 --> 25:53.366
has dropped from stage IV?

25:53.367 --> 25:55.402
That's not quite how it works.

25:55.403 --> 25:57.704
The goal isn't to lessen it,
so to speak.

25:57.705 --> 25:59.572
The goal is to remove it.

25:59.573 --> 26:02.909
Doc, why can't you just give us
the bottom line on this thing?

26:02.910 --> 26:04.544
I don't like to make predictions.

26:04.545 --> 26:06.746
But given the way
you've been fighting, Andre,

26:06.747 --> 26:08.915
I believe that
after this next treatment,

26:08.916 --> 26:11.618
you could be cancer-free.

26:12.620 --> 26:15.055
- My God!
- Thank God! Thank God.

26:15.056 --> 26:16.790
- Thank you, God!
- Thank God.

26:16.791 --> 26:18.091
And thank you, Dr. Swain.

26:18.092 --> 26:21.094
- Of course.
- Thank you, God! Thank you.

26:21.095 --> 26:22.862
Let's not forget Western medicine

26:22.863 --> 26:25.432
and-and the good doctor's skills.

26:25.433 --> 26:26.443
Yes, yes.

26:26.467 --> 26:28.701
I am so happy for you, son.

26:28.703 --> 26:30.303
- Yeah, thanks, Ma.
- Ooh!

26:30.304 --> 26:32.839
He's gonna get better. He's gonna...

26:32.840 --> 26:34.741
I knew it.

26:34.742 --> 26:36.643
He's gonna be okay.

26:39.447 --> 26:41.581
Hey, Ma.

26:41.582 --> 26:43.249
Hey, baby.

26:50.791 --> 26:53.660
Lucious came to see me today.

26:53.661 --> 26:56.162
He tried to sweet-talk me.

26:56.163 --> 26:58.832
His ego is so freakin' big.

26:58.833 --> 27:02.335
He actually thinks he can get me back.

27:02.336 --> 27:03.536
What did he say?

27:03.537 --> 27:05.538
He's the Devil.

27:05.539 --> 27:08.374
He's brought us nothing but pain
since the day I met him.

27:08.376 --> 27:09.609
I hate him.

27:10.911 --> 27:13.012
You must have liked him enough
to sleep with him.

27:13.014 --> 27:14.314
You watch your mouth, boy.

27:15.249 --> 27:17.984
No, I was so young and stupid.

27:17.985 --> 27:20.587
I was just trying so hard to fit in,

27:20.588 --> 27:22.422
and he... he just...

27:23.324 --> 27:25.291
He just what?

27:25.292 --> 27:27.293
He just what, Mom?

27:27.294 --> 27:29.462
Tell me.

27:30.431 --> 27:32.499
Did he...

27:32.500 --> 27:34.467
did he force you?

27:34.468 --> 27:36.970
He was too slick for that.

27:38.406 --> 27:40.673
But I-I didn't even know about crack

27:40.674 --> 27:44.010
until I started hanging around him.

27:44.011 --> 27:47.780
I mean, he was doing it,
so I partied with him.

27:47.782 --> 27:50.617
- You both did it together?
- Yes.

27:50.618 --> 27:53.286
But he said that he
was only ever a dealer,

27:53.287 --> 27:55.922
- that he wasn't a user.
- He's a liar.

27:55.923 --> 27:57.624
He destroyed me.

27:57.625 --> 28:00.493
Destroyed us.

28:00.494 --> 28:03.630
You know, when I told him
I was pregnant with you,

28:03.631 --> 28:06.466
he said he was gonna
beat you out of me.

28:06.467 --> 28:08.201
He said he didn't want you.

28:08.202 --> 28:09.869
He said that?

28:09.870 --> 28:12.138
I saved you.

28:12.139 --> 28:14.707
And if you love me
the way you are supposed to,

28:14.708 --> 28:16.743
you'll stop asking me

28:16.744 --> 28:19.746
- all these damn questions.
- I'm-I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

28:19.747 --> 28:21.681
I'm in a lot of pain.

28:21.682 --> 28:23.483
What can I do?

28:25.453 --> 28:27.754
Well, you can...

28:27.755 --> 28:30.490
give me a kiss like a good boy.

28:36.464 --> 28:38.565
That's so nice.

28:42.903 --> 28:45.205
Now, will you go tell
that damn lazy nurse

28:45.206 --> 28:48.775
that she needs to give me
something so I can sleep?

28:48.776 --> 28:50.877
Go.

28:50.878 --> 28:52.879
Now.

29:00.301 --> 29:01.401
_ _

29:23.471 --> 29:25.538
New Jersey!

29:27.441 --> 29:31.010
How y'all doing?!

29:33.047 --> 29:36.349
Okay, so before I
do my thing out here,

29:36.350 --> 29:39.752
I want to introduce
the newest member of the family.

29:39.754 --> 29:42.922
This is his first time on tour,

29:42.923 --> 29:45.291
y'all, so make him feel at home.

29:45.292 --> 29:47.393
He is amazing.

29:47.394 --> 29:48.995
We love you, Tiana!

29:48.996 --> 29:51.164
Yes.

29:51.165 --> 29:53.266
Please welcome Devon.

30:59.166 --> 31:02.535
- Yay!
- There we go.

31:02.536 --> 31:04.637
Celebration.

31:04.638 --> 31:06.205
Yes.

31:06.207 --> 31:08.174
- That's good, that's good.
- Okay, okay.

31:11.412 --> 31:12.979
To miracles.

31:12.980 --> 31:14.681
Miracles.

31:18.352 --> 31:19.919
This is delicious.

31:19.920 --> 31:21.921
And it tastes expensive.

31:21.922 --> 31:23.900
As it should... we're
celebrating your son's life.

31:23.924 --> 31:26.626
Yes. And this...

31:26.627 --> 31:28.394
was amazing.

31:28.395 --> 31:30.330
So you a chef chef.

31:30.331 --> 31:33.059
Well, something told me it was a
rosemary chicken kind of day.

31:34.068 --> 31:36.035
Shall we?

31:36.036 --> 31:37.870
Thank you so much.

31:37.872 --> 31:40.807
Of course. You know, making you happy

31:40.808 --> 31:43.176
make me happy, Cookie, I mean that.

31:45.412 --> 31:48.915
Yeah, I couldn't wait to
tell you the news about Andre.

31:48.916 --> 31:50.227
I couldn't have gotten
through this without you.

31:50.251 --> 31:53.519
Yeah, these last few weeks,
man, been no joke.

31:53.520 --> 31:55.521
Tell me about it, man.

31:55.522 --> 31:57.523
But here we are on the other side.

31:57.524 --> 31:59.726
Amen.

31:59.727 --> 32:02.428
Amen, baby.

32:05.466 --> 32:07.934
You're lying to your husband
and leaning on another man,

32:07.935 --> 32:10.636
that right there is
a threat to your marriage.

32:10.638 --> 32:12.638
Put your house in order.

32:12.640 --> 32:14.240
You're my everything, Cookie.

32:22.049 --> 32:23.983
I shouldn't be here.

32:23.984 --> 32:25.460
What, you trying to
take it somewhere else?

32:25.461 --> 32:26.263
No, no, no, no.

32:26.287 --> 32:29.589
I can't be here in-in your
apartment, doing this with you...

32:29.590 --> 32:31.568
- What? Yeah, yeah, this...
- whatever this is... it's over.

32:31.592 --> 32:33.826
- Why? It's perfectly fine.
- No, it's not, and...

32:33.827 --> 32:37.130
I'm sorry, I probably
sent you mixed signals.

32:37.131 --> 32:38.775
Nah, we... went through
the fire already.

32:38.799 --> 32:40.410
We're coming out
the other side, it's okay.

32:40.434 --> 32:42.835
Yeah, so did Lucious.

32:42.836 --> 32:44.337
Come on, we both know...

32:44.338 --> 32:47.607
I give you something Lucious can't.

32:49.043 --> 32:51.511
You were there for me...

32:51.512 --> 32:54.781
and I am grateful for that,
but this-this... this is over.

33:21.642 --> 33:24.210
You know, those puppy dog eyes
don't look too good on you.

33:24.211 --> 33:25.578
Who? Tiana?

33:25.579 --> 33:27.547
It ain't like that.

33:27.548 --> 33:29.182
Really?

33:29.183 --> 33:31.227
'Cause from where I'm standing,
it looks exactly like it.

33:31.251 --> 33:33.286
It's not like that.

33:37.191 --> 33:39.592
Well, good.

34:03.917 --> 34:06.018
Lucious?

34:10.290 --> 34:13.559
I need to know the real story
about how Tracy met Lucious.

34:14.928 --> 34:17.830
Is it true that you got my mom
hooked on crack?

34:29.710 --> 34:32.545
When your mother first met me

34:32.545 --> 34:34.547
and saw I was hustling,

34:34.547 --> 34:37.817
she asked if she could try my stuff.

34:37.818 --> 34:40.520
Against every warning I gave her,

34:40.521 --> 34:42.554
she tried it

34:42.556 --> 34:44.556
and she liked it.

34:46.960 --> 34:49.228
How can I believe you?

34:49.228 --> 34:51.998
Because I admit what I do wrong.

34:52.933 --> 34:55.434
I admit I sold it to her.

34:55.436 --> 34:58.638
And in my warped thinking,
I felt that,

34:58.639 --> 35:00.973
you know, maybe I was
protecting her because

35:00.974 --> 35:02.608
the stuff I was selling was clean

35:02.609 --> 35:04.621
compared to the crap
those other cats were selling

35:04.645 --> 35:07.747
- on the street...
- So big of you.

35:11.351 --> 35:13.619
It wasn't.

35:16.056 --> 35:18.791
Your mama was a good girl.

35:20.127 --> 35:23.062
She deserved better
than what I did for her.

35:26.100 --> 35:28.234
Is it true
that you threatened to kill her

35:28.235 --> 35:30.203
if she didn't abort me?

35:30.204 --> 35:32.605
That's absolutely not true.

35:32.606 --> 35:35.174
She didn't even tell me
she was pregnant with you,

35:35.175 --> 35:38.010
and then all the cats that she...

35:38.011 --> 35:39.912
Just say it.

35:39.913 --> 35:42.648
- I can take it.
- Look, man,

35:42.649 --> 35:45.351
Tracy went from being...

35:45.352 --> 35:47.653
Cute Tracy...

35:49.123 --> 35:52.091
to Crackhead Tracy to.

35:52.092 --> 35:54.694
Strawberry Tracy.

35:55.996 --> 35:58.764
I'm sorry. But there was no way

35:58.765 --> 36:02.368
I would let somebody like that
raise one of my children.

36:04.671 --> 36:06.872
But she always said
you didn't want me.

36:08.041 --> 36:11.077
That's the furthest thing
from the truth, son.

36:38.505 --> 36:40.606
You know, there's a...

36:40.607 --> 36:42.708
a lot of things

36:42.709 --> 36:44.810
I've done in my life...

36:46.180 --> 36:48.981
that I'm not proud of,

36:48.982 --> 36:51.384
but not being there for my family...

36:51.385 --> 36:53.719
not taking care of my children...

36:53.720 --> 36:57.523
that's... that's a sin
I have never committed.

36:58.592 --> 37:01.260
Your mother robbed me

37:01.261 --> 37:04.263
of the opportunity to raise you.

37:05.999 --> 37:09.635
But she ain't gonna rob us of
this moment, though, you know?

37:09.636 --> 37:12.371
I could still be your father.

37:13.707 --> 37:17.076
Let me be your father.

37:19.746 --> 37:21.847
Let me.

37:27.354 --> 37:29.522
Come on, man.

37:47.616 --> 37:48.644
I'm done.

37:48.645 --> 37:50.384
You're done when I say you're done.

37:50.385 --> 37:53.153
I heard your little bonding moment.

37:53.154 --> 37:54.225
Lucious played you.

37:54.226 --> 37:56.827
I don't care.
I'm through being your snitch.

37:56.828 --> 37:58.362
Did he threaten you?

37:58.363 --> 38:01.232
Because, you know,
we can get a warrant.

38:01.233 --> 38:02.900
We can protect you.

38:02.901 --> 38:04.535
You don't get it.

38:06.571 --> 38:08.773
Are you a Lyon all of a sudden?

38:08.774 --> 38:11.142
I don't know about being a Lyon,
Ms. Conway,

38:11.143 --> 38:14.578
but I've decided I am not a rat.

38:14.579 --> 38:17.982
All right, well, have at it,
Kingsley. Just know this.

38:17.983 --> 38:20.017
Lyon or not,

38:20.018 --> 38:22.453
I'm coming after
every single one of you.

38:28.026 --> 38:30.261
- Where's Dad?
- Who knows, child?

38:30.262 --> 38:32.740
But there's no sense in letting
this food get cold. Let's eat.

38:32.764 --> 38:35.266
Wait. What about grace?

38:35.267 --> 38:38.135
Hey, I'm sorry, everybody.
We're a little late.

38:38.136 --> 38:41.238
Come on in, man.

38:41.239 --> 38:43.607
Wait, wait, wait.
What is this clown doing here?

38:43.608 --> 38:45.376
This is your brother, son.

38:47.145 --> 38:50.281
I would like
to properly introduce Kingsley.

38:50.282 --> 38:52.883
He is a Lyon,

38:52.884 --> 38:55.286
and he is my son.

38:59.758 --> 39:02.193
I know that I've caused a lot of pain

39:02.194 --> 39:04.962
and... done real damage,

39:04.963 --> 39:06.397
and that it will take time

39:06.398 --> 39:09.099
to make things right with you all,

39:09.101 --> 39:11.502
but I hope that we can start.

39:13.605 --> 39:15.606
Here, come on. Sit down, man.

39:15.607 --> 39:18.976
Now listen, everybody at this table

39:18.977 --> 39:21.779
I've had to make amends with
at some time.

39:21.780 --> 39:25.783
Me and my son need time to heal,

39:25.784 --> 39:27.718
and I'm asking

39:27.719 --> 39:29.653
that you give us that chance.

39:31.490 --> 39:33.591
Here, take my plate.

39:41.566 --> 39:43.434
Thank you, dear.

39:43.435 --> 39:46.036
- And let me take this.
- Thank you.

39:46.037 --> 39:47.897
And I'll get you something to drink.

39:49.174 --> 39:50.407
Thank you, Juanita.

39:50.408 --> 39:51.842
Sure.

39:56.882 --> 39:59.483
Juanita, I'm gonna need me
some more wine.

39:59.484 --> 40:02.219
- Right away.
- Yes. Right away.

40:10.862 --> 40:12.496
Okay.

40:14.466 --> 40:16.467
I like to be consulted

40:16.468 --> 40:18.969
about who's sitting
at my dinner table.

40:26.444 --> 40:29.813
But I'm feeling
a little charitable because

40:29.815 --> 40:32.483
my baby's gonna be okay.

40:35.954 --> 40:39.323
Welcome, Kingsley.

40:39.324 --> 40:41.325
This can't be fixed tonight,

40:41.326 --> 40:43.594
but, we can certainly start here.

40:44.896 --> 40:47.398
Thank you, baby.

40:47.399 --> 40:49.500
Eat up, son.

41:08.286 --> 41:10.154
All right, well,

41:10.155 --> 41:12.923
since everybody's being
all awkward and quiet...

41:14.559 --> 41:17.928
I guess I'd like to say something.

41:20.065 --> 41:22.733
Big brother, I love you so much.

41:22.734 --> 41:25.736
And I'm so grateful
that you're well again.

41:25.737 --> 41:28.305
Thank you, brother.

41:28.306 --> 41:32.176
Watching you literally
fight for your life has...

41:32.177 --> 41:34.745
has reminded me and Kai
just how precious life is.

41:35.680 --> 41:37.381
And that it should be lived.

41:37.382 --> 41:40.451
- Not just planned.
- No. -

41:40.452 --> 41:42.553
Look, all y'all know
that we're getting married.

41:44.556 --> 41:47.157
But we want to get married
as soon as possible.

41:47.158 --> 41:49.159
What? Are you-are you sure?

41:49.160 --> 41:50.995
Yeah, Ma, just-just want
to get hitched

41:50.996 --> 41:52.696
and start life, you know.

41:52.697 --> 41:54.631
We just got tired of worrying about

41:54.633 --> 41:57.234
tuxedos and place settings

41:57.235 --> 41:59.013
- and Dada-Dada-da.
- It's horrible. We hate it.

41:59.037 --> 42:01.805
That's wonderful.

42:01.806 --> 42:03.340
Congratulations.

42:03.341 --> 42:04.475
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

42:04.476 --> 42:06.977
You know, that's a big move, Mal.

42:06.978 --> 42:08.612
There it is.

42:08.613 --> 42:11.782
Let's toast to Jamal and Kai.

42:11.783 --> 42:13.350
We're having a Lyon wedding, y'all.

42:13.351 --> 42:15.619
Yes.

42:15.620 --> 42:18.422
Yes.

42:20.558 --> 42:21.759
Get that one open, yeah.

42:23.161 --> 42:24.261
Hey!

42:24.262 --> 42:27.231
Hey, what the hell do y'all
think y'all doing?!

42:27.232 --> 42:28.966
Hey, I need to see a warrant!

42:28.967 --> 42:31.035
We have that, Ms. Williams.

42:31.036 --> 42:34.505
Now kindly step aside
and let my men do their job.

42:34.506 --> 42:37.775
Bitch, you don't think I know
that this is harassment?

42:37.776 --> 42:39.410
You're not our target, Ms. Williams.

42:39.411 --> 42:40.811
Are you volunteering?

42:40.812 --> 42:43.347
Is that what you're doing? No?

42:43.348 --> 42:45.315
Then you're one
of the smart ones. Your boss,

42:45.317 --> 42:47.351
not so much. For some reason,

42:47.352 --> 42:48.952
he can't let go of the past.

42:48.954 --> 42:51.255
He wants to relive
his glory days using this tour

42:51.256 --> 42:53.257
to move narcotics across the country.

42:53.258 --> 42:55.259
Check the buses,
the venue, everything.

42:55.260 --> 42:57.061
And if I were you, I would let

42:57.062 --> 43:00.631
your adoring fans out there know
that the Trust Tour is over.

43:00.632 --> 43:02.633
Somebody get bus number two open now.

43:02.634 --> 43:04.835
Yeah, yeah.
