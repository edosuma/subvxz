00:00.867 --> 00:04.644
ALL: (CHANTING) Ted! Ted!
Ted! Ted! Ted! Ted!

00:04.938 --> 00:08.977
LESLIE: Article Two, Section Two
of the Pawnee Charter reads,

00:09.075 --> 00:11.954
"Be it decreed:
Should the taxation of tea

00:12.012 --> 00:13.787
"rise to
an unacceptable level,

00:13.847 --> 00:17.192
"citizens shall dump
Ted into Ramsett Lake."

00:17.417 --> 00:18.623
(ALL CHEERING)

00:19.352 --> 00:20.456
Does anyone object?

00:20.520 --> 00:22.261
As always, I object.

00:22.322 --> 00:24.063
Nay,
enough dithering!

00:24.124 --> 00:26.400
Dump the miscreant!
Boo!

00:26.493 --> 00:27.699
(ALL CHEERING)

00:27.794 --> 00:31.241
<i>LESLIE: Today is Ted Party
Day, where we commemorate</i>

00:31.297 --> 00:33.641
<i>the great Pawnee
tea dump of 1817.</i>

00:33.700 --> 00:34.906
Historical fun fact,

00:34.968 --> 00:37.209
when the Founding Fathers
wrote the charter,

00:37.270 --> 00:38.806
<i>their old-time y script made</i>

00:38.872 --> 00:40.579
<i>one of the As look like a D,</i>

00:40.640 --> 00:42.142
<i>so "tea" became "ted."</i>

00:42.275 --> 00:43.515
<i>It's just one of
those little things</i>

00:43.576 --> 00:46.386
<i>that reminds us of Pawnee's
rich and vibrant past.</i>

00:46.446 --> 00:49.552
Plus, we get to go find a guy named
Ted and throw him into the lake.

00:49.616 --> 00:50.720
CROWD: One!

00:50.784 --> 00:52.457
I don't even
go by Ted!

00:52.519 --> 00:53.554
Two!

00:53.686 --> 00:54.721
I go by Theodore!

00:54.788 --> 00:56.096
Three!

01:19.546 --> 01:21.389
Hey, Ted.
Great job today.

01:21.448 --> 01:22.927
You were so funny
when you were like,

01:23.049 --> 01:24.960
"My cell phone,
I left it in my pocket."

01:25.018 --> 01:26.656
Then you checked it, remember,
and it didn't work.

01:26.719 --> 01:28.323
(LAUGHS)
Yeah, that was hilarious.

01:28.421 --> 01:31.698
Listen, I am just here to say that
I am done with Ted Party Day.

01:31.791 --> 01:34.135
Ha! Classic Ted.
TED: I'm serious.

01:34.260 --> 01:35.898
I'm not getting dumped
in that lake anymore.

01:35.962 --> 01:37.100
And I talked to
the other Teds in town,

01:37.230 --> 01:38.402
and they're not
doing it either.

01:38.498 --> 01:40.034
Come on, Ted Party
Day is protected

01:40.166 --> 01:41.736
by Article Two in
the town charter.

01:41.801 --> 01:43.872
And we have the right,
nay, the obligation,

01:44.003 --> 01:46.108
to dump Ted into
the lake every year.

01:46.172 --> 01:47.344
That's the way
it's always been done.

01:47.474 --> 01:49.420
Okay, first of all, "that's the
way it's always been done"

01:49.476 --> 01:51.752
is not a good reason
to keep doing something.

01:51.811 --> 01:54.348
Second, it was a misprint.
They clearly meant tea.

01:54.414 --> 01:56.291
I just think you
need to be careful

01:56.416 --> 01:58.327
about speculating
what the Founders meant

01:58.418 --> 02:00.193
when they were
writing the town charter.

02:00.253 --> 02:03.325
Okay, fine. You want to enforce every
single old law we have on our books?

02:03.456 --> 02:05.163
Hey, can I see your
keys for a second?

02:05.792 --> 02:07.066
Here's a quarter.

02:07.293 --> 02:08.601
I own your car now.

02:09.262 --> 02:10.297
Sorry.

02:10.395 --> 02:13.002
The Pawnee Charter clearly
states that any white citizen

02:13.066 --> 02:16.206
has the right to seize any
Indian property for 25 cents.

02:16.302 --> 02:18.942
That is an outdated
and racist law.

02:19.005 --> 02:21.076
And obviously,
they meant American Indian.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.677
Whoa, I think
we should be careful

02:22.742 --> 02:24.653
when we speculate
what the Founders intended

02:24.711 --> 02:25.985
when they wrote the charter.

02:26.045 --> 02:29.185
Okay, Ted. I know what you're doing.
You're quoting me back to me.

02:29.249 --> 02:31.058
But I'm gonna
quote me back to you

02:31.184 --> 02:33.027
and say that Ted Party
Day will never change.

02:33.153 --> 02:37.829
Uh-oh. You, a woman, just raised
your voice to a landowning male.

02:38.057 --> 02:40.560
According to a Pawnee statute
passed in 1868,

02:40.894 --> 02:42.100
I get to do this.

02:46.666 --> 02:48.668
I was not aware
of that statute.

02:51.037 --> 02:52.141
Ron, you have
to help me.

02:52.272 --> 02:53.615
Chris is making
me do some stupid

02:53.673 --> 02:55.414
management training
leadership course.

02:55.575 --> 02:57.452
Now that you run the
Animal Control department,

02:57.510 --> 03:00.389
you have qualified for the Chris
Traeger Management Training Seminar

03:00.780 --> 03:02.054
or CTMTS.

03:02.582 --> 03:04.653
It's not a great acronym,
but it is a great seminar.

03:05.385 --> 03:06.693
Can you get
me out of it?

03:06.753 --> 03:07.754
Yes.

03:08.154 --> 03:11.499
RON: <i>Normally, if given a choice
between doing something and nothing,</i>

03:11.558 --> 03:12.662
<i>I'd choose to do nothing.</i>

03:12.926 --> 03:15.566
But I will do something if it
helps someone else do nothing.

03:15.728 --> 03:18.231
I'd work all night
if it meant nothing got done.

03:18.798 --> 03:20.471
CHRIS: Ron Swanson
and April Ludgate,

03:20.600 --> 03:23.046
literally my two favorite people
in the cataloged universe.

03:23.403 --> 03:26.850
April will not be participating
in your pointless course

03:26.906 --> 03:29.182
because she has more
important things to do

03:29.242 --> 03:32.519
like not participating
in your pointless course.

03:32.779 --> 03:36.158
I just want April to become as great
a department head as yourself.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.889
Which is why
this is pointless.

03:38.084 --> 03:40.621
I've been head of the Parks
Department for 12 years,

03:40.753 --> 03:43.233
and I never had any
management training course.

03:43.489 --> 03:46.231
Ron, you've never
been CTMTSed?

03:46.726 --> 03:49.605
I am legally required to CTMTS
every department head.

03:49.796 --> 03:51.673
Otherwise, we are open
to all kinds of liability.

03:51.798 --> 03:52.799
What are you saying?

03:52.932 --> 03:54.377
I'm saying that
tomorrow during the seminar,

03:54.500 --> 03:55.979
April is going to
have a classmate.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.476
And spoiler alert...

03:57.537 --> 03:59.141
It's you.
It's ALF.

04:00.573 --> 04:01.916
This went poorly.

04:02.542 --> 04:03.543
(DOOR OPENS)

04:03.843 --> 04:05.516
What, no. Damn it!

04:05.778 --> 04:06.779
What are you bidding on?

04:07.013 --> 04:09.619
It better not be Terrence Howard's
tank top from Hustle <i>& Flow.</i>

04:09.749 --> 04:11.228
Good.
It is not.

04:11.284 --> 04:13.423
'Cause I am bidding on it and
I am ready to spend an amount

04:13.486 --> 04:15.830
that my accountant calls
"dangerous and irresponsible."

04:16.089 --> 04:18.695
JJ's Diner put an old
waffle iron up for auction.

04:18.757 --> 04:21.034
It's the perfect Breakfast
Day gift for Leslie.

04:21.160 --> 04:22.161
"Breakfast Day"?

04:22.228 --> 04:24.265
ANN: <i>Leslie has
anniversaries for everything.</i>

04:24.464 --> 04:26.569
"Zoo Day," first time we went
to the zoo together.

04:26.766 --> 04:29.076
"Double Date Day," it was the first
time we went on a double date.

04:29.135 --> 04:30.341
"Daniel Day-Lewis Day."

04:30.403 --> 04:31.473
"Talk Like A Pirate Day."

04:31.537 --> 04:33.016
"Talk Like
A Pittsburgh Pirate day,"

04:33.072 --> 04:34.847
which, why and how?

04:35.008 --> 04:38.012
This calendar was last
year's Calendar Day present

04:38.077 --> 04:41.650
celebrating the first time she
ever bought me a calendar.

04:41.848 --> 04:42.849
(sums)

04:43.216 --> 04:44.820
You have to buy a present
for every one of these?

04:44.917 --> 04:47.261
She always tells me not to, but
then she buys me something

04:47.320 --> 04:49.163
that's awesome and thoughtful,
and then I feel terrible.

04:49.255 --> 04:51.201
But that's the thing.
This is the perfect present.

04:51.257 --> 04:54.932
I just keep getting outbid by someone
named "Tall Tyrion Lannister."

04:54.994 --> 04:56.769
What kind of name
is Tyrion anyway?

04:57.030 --> 04:59.135
You're kidding, right?
Tyrion Lannister?

04:59.632 --> 05:02.203
Lord of Casterly Rock?
The Half-Man?

05:02.702 --> 05:03.908
You don't watch
Game of Thrones?

05:03.970 --> 05:05.881
No. You do?
Hell yeah.

05:05.972 --> 05:08.077
Have you seen
those Dothraki dudes?

05:08.308 --> 05:09.446
They can get it.

05:09.542 --> 05:11.920
Everybody on that
show can get it.

05:13.513 --> 05:15.254
I think I know who
I'm bidding against.

05:16.249 --> 05:18.456
LESLIE: I now realize
that I was wrong,

05:18.584 --> 05:20.621
and it's time that
we purged the books

05:20.687 --> 05:24.260
of many of our town's
outdated and obscure laws.

05:24.624 --> 05:27.264
The bill that I have written with the
full support of the city council

05:27.427 --> 05:30.533
will repeal
110 obsolete laws

05:30.596 --> 05:34.442
such as all menstruating women shall
be confined to their bathtubs

05:34.500 --> 05:37.811
and Article Two,
aka, Ted Party Day.

05:38.071 --> 05:40.142
The floor is now open
for public comments.

05:40.239 --> 05:41.547
Oh, here we go.
Thank you.

05:41.607 --> 05:45.248
My name is Garth Blundin, and I
object to your ridiculous proposal.

05:45.578 --> 05:49.253
Uh, the Pawnee Charter
shall not be changed.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.760
Not today, not ever!

05:50.850 --> 05:53.330
Wow, a lot of passion, Mr. Blundin.
Thank you so much.

05:53.386 --> 05:55.059
Your objection is noted
and officially in the record.

05:55.121 --> 05:56.395
Shall we proceed to...

05:56.522 --> 05:57.796
No. No, we shall not.

05:57.924 --> 06:01.997
Article Seven, Section Three
allows for a citizen filibuster.

06:02.128 --> 06:05.507
If I stand here and
refuse to yield my time,

06:05.631 --> 06:08.271
you are prohibited
from voting on the bill.

06:08.968 --> 06:12.415
That section defines buffalo
meat as acceptable currency.

06:12.472 --> 06:13.974
Is that the buffalo meat one?
Mm-hmm.

06:14.574 --> 06:18.021
I meant Article Three,
Section Seven.

06:18.111 --> 06:21.354
(CLEARS HIS THROAT)
Let the filibustering begin.

06:21.714 --> 06:24.194
I would now like to
share some ideas I have

06:24.317 --> 06:26.820
for J.J. Abrams'
seventh chapter

06:26.986 --> 06:28.431
<i>'m the Star Wars Saga.</i>

06:28.521 --> 06:31.400
Pan down from
the twin suns of Tatooine.

06:31.457 --> 06:34.404
We are now close on the
mouth of the Sarlacc pit.

06:34.460 --> 06:35.495
After a beat,

06:35.561 --> 06:39.771
the gloved Mandalorian armor
gauntlet of Boba Fett

06:40.066 --> 06:42.637
grabs onto the sand
outside the Sarlacc pit

06:42.702 --> 06:45.808
and the feared bounty
hunter pulls himself

06:45.938 --> 06:49.351
from the maw of
the sand beast. Then...

06:49.409 --> 06:50.683
Ugh. He's right.
He can do this.

06:50.743 --> 06:51.778
(GARTH CONTINUES
INAUDIBLY)

06:51.844 --> 06:53.323
This is exactly why we need
to modernize these laws.

06:53.379 --> 06:56.292
This kind of thing made sense
when we had council in a barn

06:56.382 --> 06:58.055
and there were 80
people in the town.

06:58.184 --> 06:59.629
But now, this is nuts.

06:59.719 --> 07:01.392
GARTH: If he holds
the reality gem,

07:01.654 --> 07:04.658
that means he can jump
from different realities.

07:04.724 --> 07:06.362
This will be our link

07:06.426 --> 07:08.929
to the Marvel Universe
from the Star Wars Universe.

07:10.797 --> 07:13.368
Imagine those two going up
against Robot Chewbacca,

07:13.433 --> 07:14.605
'cause that's gonna happen.

07:14.667 --> 07:16.613
After a beat, Luke says,

07:16.669 --> 07:19.013
"Darth Vader was my father, but
Ben Kenobi was my master."

07:19.071 --> 07:20.914
And he cuts
Hannibal Lecter in half.

07:20.973 --> 07:22.111
Mr. Blundin,

07:22.175 --> 07:23.848
look, the laws I'm
trying to get rid of

07:23.976 --> 07:25.649
have no more relevance
in modern society

07:25.711 --> 07:27.315
and they're
embarrassing to Pawnee.

07:27.580 --> 07:30.322
Repealing them would show that
we're changing with the times.

07:30.550 --> 07:33.053
You can't just change
the charter willy-nilly.

07:33.386 --> 07:36.162
You start by casually repealing
a couple of old laws,

07:36.289 --> 07:38.963
the next thing you know,
your jackbooted Stormtroopers

07:39.025 --> 07:40.732
are kicking in my door
and arresting my wife

07:40.860 --> 07:42.601
for no reason,
if I were married.

07:42.662 --> 07:45.700
By "jackbooted Stormtroopers," do you
mean the Pawnee Police Department?

07:45.865 --> 07:47.003
Hey, Clyde.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.271
Hi, Leslie.

07:48.434 --> 07:49.777
Good Danish today.

07:50.136 --> 07:52.707
The Pawnee Charter is not a
living document, Ms. Knope.

07:52.839 --> 07:54.876
You have no respect for the
traditions of this town.

07:54.941 --> 07:56.477
I absolutely do.

07:56.542 --> 07:59.045
I used to give tours at the
Pawnee Historical House.

07:59.212 --> 08:01.158
Three times Employee
Of The Fortnight.

08:01.280 --> 08:03.760
Oh, big deal, you put on a
costume for a couple hours.

08:04.050 --> 08:07.759
By that logic, every time I go
to bed at night, lam Wolverine.

08:08.221 --> 08:09.598
You bought
X-Men pajamas?

08:09.689 --> 08:11.930
I won them,
madam, in a raffle.

08:12.191 --> 08:13.693
The point is is that
our Founding Fathers

08:13.826 --> 08:15.362
were brilliant and
they were courageous,

08:15.428 --> 08:18.773
but they also had wooden teeth and
pooped in holes in the ground.

08:18.898 --> 08:20.571
It was a more
primitive time.

08:20.633 --> 08:22.044
It was a better time.

08:22.101 --> 08:23.136
(SCOFFS)

08:23.202 --> 08:25.148
You wouldn't have survived
two weeks in their day.

08:25.204 --> 08:27.309
Oh, really?
How about a little wager?

08:27.373 --> 08:29.751
How about you and I go live
in that historical house,

08:29.809 --> 08:32.881
no modern technology,
1817 rules.

08:33.078 --> 08:34.854
If you last longer,
I withdraw my bill.

08:35.014 --> 08:36.994
I win, you
stop this nonsense.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.458
(LAUGHING) You have
yourself a deal.

08:41.187 --> 08:44.168
Please write down what you
hope to gain from the seminar,

08:44.222 --> 08:46.829
seal it in the envelope, and then
we'll open it when it's over.

08:46.993 --> 08:48.438
When is this over?

08:48.561 --> 08:49.835
As soon as you
learn to embrace

08:49.962 --> 08:51.236
the power of
positive motivation.

08:52.698 --> 08:54.302
It's a nine-hour
seminar over two days.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.172
Whoa!
Oh, good.

08:56.369 --> 08:57.404
All right,
let's begin.

08:57.470 --> 08:59.450
Hop on board
The Management Train.

08:59.505 --> 09:01.781
First stop,
Motivation Station.

09:02.108 --> 09:03.109
(BLOWS TRAIN WHISTLE)

09:03.509 --> 09:04.920
(SHOUTING) All aboard!

09:05.611 --> 09:07.955
Stop bidding on
my waffle iron.

09:08.014 --> 09:09.550
You're "Future
Mrs. Tiger Woods"?

09:09.649 --> 09:12.152
I made that profile, like, ten years ago.
I don't know how to change it.

09:12.251 --> 09:15.721
The point is, I'm getting that waffle
iron for Leslie for Breakfast Day.

09:15.788 --> 09:18.826
No, you're not. I'm getting
it for her for Waffle Day.

09:18.891 --> 09:20.427
Wait, you have
a Breakfast Day, too?

09:20.493 --> 09:22.302
Mine's in June.
Please, Ben.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.874
This is the celebration
of the anniversary

09:23.996 --> 09:25.498
of the first time
we hung out at JJ's,

09:25.565 --> 09:27.545
which she considers the
beginning of our friendship.

09:27.633 --> 09:29.340
Well, imagine being
married to her.

09:29.502 --> 09:32.142
It's like being smothered
with a hand-quilted pillow

09:32.204 --> 09:33.911
filled with
cherished memories.

09:34.173 --> 09:36.483
I can't believe I'm complaining
about how thoughtful my wife is.

09:36.943 --> 09:38.422
I'm sorry, honey.
I love you.

09:38.477 --> 09:39.979
Look, I have
known her for longer,

09:40.112 --> 09:41.614
I have five years'
worth of anniversaries,

09:41.681 --> 09:42.921
so I have seniority.

09:42.982 --> 09:44.552
Oh, God. Oh, no.
We've lost the auction.

09:44.617 --> 09:45.618
What? No.

09:45.685 --> 09:48.529
Somebody swooped in at the last
second, and now we're both screwed.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.829
No. Okay,
Tyrion Lannister,

09:50.890 --> 09:52.130
why don't you
just cast a spell

09:52.258 --> 09:53.498
and get us
the waffle iron back?

09:53.559 --> 09:56.199
Okay. I don't even have time
to tell you how wrong you are.

09:56.629 --> 09:58.131
Actually, it's gonna
bug me if I don't.

09:58.197 --> 10:00.006
The Lannisters,
while very wealthy,

10:00.132 --> 10:01.975
do not possess
the magical abilities

10:02.034 --> 10:03.980
of, say, the Warlocks
of Qarth for example.

10:04.337 --> 10:06.248
This is why we
don't hang out.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.781
CHRIS: Think of
yourselves as engineers

10:09.909 --> 10:11.684
steering a locomotive
of positivity

10:11.744 --> 10:13.189
that runs on team power.

10:13.346 --> 10:16.054
First of all, you don't
steer a locomotive.

10:16.182 --> 10:17.286
The tracks do.

10:17.516 --> 10:20.122
Second, there are only three
ways to motivate people.

10:20.186 --> 10:21.893
Money, fear,
and hunger.

10:22.054 --> 10:23.192
Oh, I disagree.

10:23.255 --> 10:25.758
What about encouragement,
appreciation,

10:25.825 --> 10:27.429
and smiles.

10:27.526 --> 10:31.030
When people feel supported, they will
literally explode with productivity.

10:31.364 --> 10:33.275
Can you guys just figure
out which way is better

10:33.366 --> 10:34.470
and tell me
so we can leave?

10:34.533 --> 10:35.534
Thank you for
your input, April,

10:35.601 --> 10:38.548
but the CTMTS requires that we
follow a very specific syllabus.

10:38.604 --> 10:40.208
You're not being
very inclusive, Chris.

10:40.272 --> 10:42.115
I feel like my input
isn't being appreciated.

10:42.642 --> 10:43.780
You've killed
my spirit.

10:44.677 --> 10:46.350
My spirit blood
is on your hands.

10:47.680 --> 10:49.455
My God, I've taught
you so much already.

10:49.515 --> 10:51.495
Ron, I propose
a challenge

10:51.550 --> 10:54.326
to see whose motivational
methods are more effective.

10:54.754 --> 10:56.256
RON: Challenge accepted.

10:56.422 --> 10:58.459
I don't want to
seem overdramatic,

10:58.524 --> 11:01.198
but this is literally a
battle for April's soul.

11:01.627 --> 11:03.732
I don't want to
seem overdramatic,

11:03.796 --> 11:06.299
but I don't really
care what happens here.

11:07.600 --> 11:10.103
ANDY: Oh, God.
I hate this place.

11:10.403 --> 11:12.974
Everything is old.
Old things are dumb.

11:13.105 --> 11:15.016
It's like,
just be new.

11:15.074 --> 11:16.178
I don't know, Tom.

11:16.242 --> 11:17.812
I think there's some pretty
cool things from back then.

11:17.877 --> 11:19.379
That is a dope bonnet.
(DOOR OPENS)

11:19.478 --> 11:21.355
Oh, just
getting here, I see.

11:21.414 --> 11:23.223
Yikes. Did you sleep
here last night?

11:23.349 --> 11:25.329
Indeed. I want to be
here when the cock crows

11:25.384 --> 11:26.419
to get the
chores done.

11:26.552 --> 11:28.156
Already, I've
done the preserves

11:28.220 --> 11:30.962
and chased off an interloping
cable installer.

11:31.090 --> 11:34.537
Okay, well, let's put all
modern devices in this pail.

11:34.760 --> 11:37.240
Nothing can be used that
was invented past 1817.

11:37.797 --> 11:39.799
Andy, Tom, you will
be our referees.

11:39.865 --> 11:40.900
Thank you
for volunteering.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.105
Definitely didn't volunteer. I
had much better things to do.

11:43.169 --> 11:44.341
Leslie said she'd
pay me 100 bucks.

11:44.403 --> 11:46.747
And I had nothing better to do.
I'm doing it for free.

11:46.939 --> 11:48.612
<i>LESLIE: There's no way I'm
losing this contest.</i>

11:48.774 --> 11:50.219
Old-timey dress? Check.

11:50.276 --> 11:52.916
Extensive knowledge about early
prairie life? Right here.

11:53.079 --> 11:54.251
Rickets? Cured.

11:54.313 --> 11:55.348
Don't need to
worry about rickets.

11:55.414 --> 11:58.088
Antiperspirant?
Not allowed.

11:58.784 --> 12:00.354
Might get a little
rough in there.

12:01.087 --> 12:03.431
Hey, I was wondering if
you could help me out.

12:03.689 --> 12:05.100
Say no more.

12:05.191 --> 12:06.693
Here's a bunch of guns.

12:07.226 --> 12:08.967
Nope. Different thing.

12:09.328 --> 12:12.935
I saw that you recently won an auction
for the JJ's diner waffle iron.

12:13.165 --> 12:14.872
And I'd like to...
That's it right there.

12:14.934 --> 12:16.641
I'd like to buy it.
You and everyone else.

12:17.870 --> 12:19.076
Hello, Ben.

12:19.138 --> 12:21.675
Seems like I love
Leslie more than you do.

12:21.874 --> 12:23.251
Get in line.
ROZ: Yeah.

12:23.743 --> 12:24.813
Get in line, pal.

12:25.010 --> 12:26.318
Who are you?
I'm Roz.

12:26.378 --> 12:28.483
I'm Leslie's mailwoman,
and I need to get her

12:28.614 --> 12:30.753
a Mail Day present
by next Wednesday.

12:31.317 --> 12:32.728
It's the anniversary
of the first...

12:32.818 --> 12:35.298
BOTH: Time you delivered
her mail. Yeah, we get it.

12:35.354 --> 12:37.300
Looks like we've got
ourselves an old-fashioned

12:37.356 --> 12:39.358
pawnshop waffle
iron bidding war.

12:39.525 --> 12:42.005
Let's start the bidding
at $650,000.

12:42.294 --> 12:44.501
Okay, I'll counter
with 100 bucks.

12:44.563 --> 12:45.667
200.

12:45.731 --> 12:47.108
I'll let you take
anything out of this bag.

12:47.166 --> 12:48.167
OWNER: I'll tell you
what, Ann.

12:48.267 --> 12:49.746
I'll give it to you if
you go on a date with me.

12:50.703 --> 12:52.979
Oh, God. I can't believe I'm
about to do this, but fine.

12:53.272 --> 12:55.775
One date. But let me make
one thing perfectly clear...

12:55.841 --> 12:57.445
500 bucks.
Sold.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.248
What?
You still want to go out?

12:59.378 --> 13:02.916
I just come into some money.
$500 buys a lot of nitrous.

13:03.215 --> 13:06.856
Yeah, nothing warms the blood
like an old whirly-bout

13:06.919 --> 13:08.159
with the old
butter-gyre, eh, Leslie?

13:08.287 --> 13:09.527
Indeed.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.791
(WHISPERING) Man, this guy's
tougher than I thought.

13:11.857 --> 13:13.666
I don't know how either
of you guys are doing this.

13:13.726 --> 13:15.296
One time my refrigerator
stopped working,

13:15.427 --> 13:16.997
I didn't know what to do.
I just moved.

13:17.296 --> 13:19.173
I just don't think
he's ever gonna quit.

13:19.298 --> 13:21.835
He has that look in his eye that
Ben gets when he plays <i>Risk.</i>

13:22.234 --> 13:24.214
(SOUND OF CHURN
RATTLING QUICKLY)

13:25.304 --> 13:27.147
Oh, wow.
That is really good.

13:27.339 --> 13:28.716
LESLIE: Andy.
No, I'm sorry.

13:28.841 --> 13:29.979
This tastes great.

13:30.109 --> 13:31.486
All my favorite foods
have butter on 'em.

13:31.544 --> 13:34.753
Pancakes, toast,
popcorn, grapes.

13:34.814 --> 13:35.815
(GASPS)

13:36.382 --> 13:37.690
Butter is my favorite food.

13:37.783 --> 13:39.660
Well, then you're gonna love
what I'm churning up. (CHUCKLES)

13:39.752 --> 13:41.095
Take a look at... Oh, my God.
This is horrifying.

13:41.153 --> 13:42.791
(GASPS)
Nobody eat that.

13:43.489 --> 13:45.264
<i>LESLIE: I think I'm in
over my head.</i>

13:45.324 --> 13:46.769
<i>Garth really
knows his stuff.</i>

13:47.193 --> 13:49.195
<i>He planted an entire
field of barley.</i>

13:49.428 --> 13:51.339
How long is he
planning on staying here?

13:52.097 --> 13:55.635
Hey, um, aren't we husband
and wife in this scenario?

13:55.701 --> 13:57.374
I mean, like, shouldn't you...
Not a chance.

13:57.436 --> 13:58.540
Okay.

14:04.143 --> 14:05.451
Wait, what's that?

14:05.511 --> 14:06.854
Do you guys feel that?

14:07.880 --> 14:09.518
(SCREAMS)
(CHICKEN CLUCKING)

14:09.582 --> 14:10.959
How long was
that under there?

14:11.016 --> 14:13.053
TOM: Man, Garth
is a machine.

14:13.118 --> 14:15.155
He brought his own whale
blubber to light the lamps.

14:15.254 --> 14:17.234
I thought he was
gonna last an hour max.

14:17.289 --> 14:19.826
It's like he's getting stronger
the longer he stays here.

14:19.892 --> 14:20.996
GARTH: Wee!

14:21.126 --> 14:22.935
Look at
my hoop, Leslie.

14:22.995 --> 14:24.269
Look at my hoop!

14:24.563 --> 14:26.133
(SCOFFS) Who could
live like this?

14:26.398 --> 14:28.537
No one. That's why
we've moved on.

14:28.634 --> 14:31.547
It's fun to be here on, like, a
school field trip or something.

14:31.604 --> 14:32.639
It's so, so, so fun.

14:32.771 --> 14:33.806
So, so fun.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.784
But to live like
this is insane.

14:36.175 --> 14:37.916
He must have
cheated somehow.

14:38.043 --> 14:40.114
I mean, there's no way a man
who's into X-Men that much

14:40.179 --> 14:41.624
can stay away from
the Internet that long.

14:41.981 --> 14:43.119
We should check
his phone.

14:43.182 --> 14:45.219
GARTH: (SINGING)
Goodness, how delicious

14:45.284 --> 14:47.059
<i>Eating goober peas</i>

14:48.254 --> 14:49.665
CHRIS: Jerry Gergich.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.724
I need you to stop whatever
it is you're doing

14:51.857 --> 14:53.894
and file as many
of these as you can.

14:54.126 --> 14:58.097
Wow, Duraflex cut-top
A350s in deep maroon?

14:58.631 --> 15:00.508
(CHUCKLES)
The honor is all mine.

15:00.599 --> 15:02.408
Well, I knew you were
the man for the job.

15:02.801 --> 15:04.974
You are smart
and capable.

15:05.137 --> 15:07.617
And I believe you can
accomplish anything.

15:08.173 --> 15:09.379
Thank you so much.

15:09.942 --> 15:11.546
You got it, champ.
Get filing.

15:11.610 --> 15:12.987
Ho-ho!
Aye, aye, Captain.

15:14.346 --> 15:16.451
CHRIS: That is one
motivated worker bee.

15:16.515 --> 15:18.153
You guys doing
experiments on Jerry?

15:18.484 --> 15:19.485
Yes.
Yes.

15:19.551 --> 15:20.655
Cool.

15:23.722 --> 15:24.928
(RATTLING SOUND)

15:25.291 --> 15:26.599
TOM: Got it.

15:26.792 --> 15:28.135
Okay, now let's not
read anything.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.603
That's an invasion
of his privacy.

15:29.662 --> 15:31.471
Let's just look at
his browser history

15:31.530 --> 15:33.601
and his inbox and his outbox
and his Facebook page.

15:33.666 --> 15:35.145
Yeah, he doesn't
have any new emails.

15:35.267 --> 15:36.803
Oh, my God.
It's true.

15:36.902 --> 15:38.904
He hasn't gotten
an email in

15:38.971 --> 15:40.279
twelve days!

15:40.339 --> 15:41.477
Is he a ghost?

15:41.807 --> 15:43.309
The only ones
he gets are spam.

15:43.575 --> 15:44.952
And he responds to them.

15:45.077 --> 15:46.454
I think I'm
gonna be sick.

15:46.545 --> 15:48.582
Oh, man. This guy
has no friends.

15:48.714 --> 15:50.990
ANDY: I don't know. Seems like
he's friends with that mule.

15:51.216 --> 15:52.217
(sums)

15:54.954 --> 15:56.297
What's that?

15:56.355 --> 15:58.995
Well, since I can't give her
a waffle iron for Breakfast Day,

15:59.058 --> 16:01.766
lam making her a miniature
Leslie out of breakfast food.

16:01.994 --> 16:02.995
Good lord.

16:03.095 --> 16:04.096
Well, listen,
I've been thinking.

16:04.163 --> 16:06.609
How would you feel about going
in on the waffle iron together?

16:06.765 --> 16:08.676
Seriously?
That would be great,

16:08.934 --> 16:10.538
but whose holiday
are we celebrating?

16:10.636 --> 16:12.547
Well, I think I may have
a plan that'll get us

16:12.671 --> 16:14.617
out of Breakfast
Day and Waffle Day

16:14.673 --> 16:17.586
and all the other Days without making
us seem like ungrateful people

16:17.643 --> 16:19.953
who are annoyed at
how amazing Leslie is.

16:20.312 --> 16:22.485
Dude, whatever
it is, I'm in.

16:22.548 --> 16:23.549
Okay, great.

16:23.615 --> 16:24.616
What should
I do with this?

16:24.683 --> 16:27.789
Uh, just burn it and bury the ashes
and pray it doesn't haunt you.

16:30.789 --> 16:34.032
Jerry, stop filing
those red folders at once.

16:34.126 --> 16:35.901
Begin filing
these blue ones.

16:35.961 --> 16:38.134
Oh, sorry, Ron.
I promised Chris that...

16:38.263 --> 16:39.640
This is the
top priority.

16:39.698 --> 16:41.439
I need these blue
folders done now.

16:41.500 --> 16:44.447
You can eat when
you have finished.

16:45.070 --> 16:46.105
(YELLING) File!

16:46.171 --> 16:47.479
Oh, my goodness.

16:48.574 --> 16:51.145
Money, fear, hunger.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.460
LESLIE: Hey, there, Garth.
Whatcha whittling?

16:56.515 --> 16:58.426
A birthing stick.
What's that?

16:58.484 --> 16:59.656
You do not
want to know.

16:59.785 --> 17:00.957
Oh, my God.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.226
Oh, you look beautiful.

17:02.287 --> 17:03.925
I mean, you
changed clothes.

17:03.989 --> 17:05.730
Violation.
I challenge...

17:05.790 --> 17:07.566
You are bonnetless!
Yes, you're right.

17:07.626 --> 17:09.502
I admit, I can't take
it anymore. You win.

17:09.560 --> 17:12.166
Huzzah!
The day is mine.

17:12.631 --> 17:13.973
(CLEARS THROAT) I...

17:14.633 --> 17:16.407
I'm gonna miss saying huzzah.
Yeah.

17:16.635 --> 17:18.512
Garth, I have another
proposition.

17:18.569 --> 17:20.446
Yes, I will go out
on a date with you,

17:20.571 --> 17:22.449
but I realize
you're a modern woman,

17:22.508 --> 17:24.385
so I will
let you pay.

17:24.777 --> 17:26.518
No. I was wondering,
would you like to join

17:26.645 --> 17:28.420
the Pawnee Historical
Commission?

17:28.513 --> 17:30.721
Those clowns?
No, thank you.

17:31.083 --> 17:32.994
They haven't answered a
single one of my complaints

17:33.052 --> 17:36.056
about their anachronistic use
of fonts in their newsletter.

17:36.221 --> 17:38.599
Well, I'm a member, and I think
we could really use you.

17:38.991 --> 17:42.131
But the only problem is
there's tons of meetings,

17:42.194 --> 17:45.403
lots of work with people
who also love history,

17:45.464 --> 17:48.809
and many social occasions that
you're gonna have to attend,

17:48.867 --> 17:50.676
like cocktail
parties and such.

17:50.803 --> 17:53.010
I can understand if it's something
you don't want to commit to.

17:53.472 --> 17:56.146
Just sounds like such a big bite
out of my soap-making time.

17:56.542 --> 17:58.920
(SIGHS) My cousin's
arraignment is in May.

17:59.044 --> 18:01.923
But that's a day. I just fly
out, I come back the same day.

18:01.980 --> 18:03.220
On atrial basis, yes.

18:03.282 --> 18:04.488
Yes, yes.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.195
Great. Welcome
to the team.

18:06.885 --> 18:08.159
<i>LESLIE: Garth dropped
his protest,</i>

18:08.220 --> 18:11.326
<i>and we were able to get rid of all the
outdated laws in the town charter.</i>

18:11.390 --> 18:13.427
I mean, the charter is
a wonderful document,

18:13.492 --> 18:17.531
but we've had the benefit of almost
200 years of learning and advancing.

18:17.596 --> 18:19.473
Seems to me we
ought to use it.

18:19.531 --> 18:21.807
I did not change
Article Two, though.

18:21.867 --> 18:24.643
I just couldn't vote against a
good, old-fashioned lake dunking.

18:24.703 --> 18:26.478
Though Garth and I did
come up with a compromise

18:26.538 --> 18:28.415
that I think will
make everybody happy.

18:28.474 --> 18:32.115
From this year hence,
a volunteer will represent Ted

18:32.177 --> 18:35.283
in our town's most historic
and cherished tradition.

18:35.347 --> 18:38.817
This year, the honor goes
to Mr. Garth Blundin!

18:38.984 --> 18:40.588
(ALL CHEERING)

18:41.653 --> 18:44.657
Huzzah, I'm Ted!
I'm Ted!

18:44.723 --> 18:46.066
ANDY: I'm Ted,
too, guys.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.695
LESLIE: Andy!
Yeah!

18:47.893 --> 18:49.770
He's naked, everybody!
Put that away!

18:49.895 --> 18:50.930
We're all Ted! Yeah!

18:50.996 --> 18:51.997
LESLIE: No, Andy!

18:52.197 --> 18:54.336
(ALL CHEERING)

18:55.167 --> 18:56.168
Woo!

18:56.602 --> 18:58.946
Thank God.
I don't know how to swim.

19:00.873 --> 19:02.409
DONNA: Okay, final tally.

19:02.574 --> 19:05.418
Jerry filed
268 red files.

19:05.477 --> 19:06.683
Yes!

19:06.745 --> 19:09.817
And 384 blue files.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.890
Yes. Wait a minute.
How is that possible?

19:11.950 --> 19:14.089
Well, he was so happy when you
told him he was doing a great job

19:14.153 --> 19:16.429
that he spent 20 minutes on the
phone telling Gayle about it.

19:16.488 --> 19:17.831
And the
prosecution rests.

19:17.956 --> 19:19.299
Not so fast.

19:19.358 --> 19:20.803
He may have
filed more blue ones,

19:20.926 --> 19:22.371
but they're
almost all filed wrong.

19:22.427 --> 19:25.135
Not surprising since he was a
mess after you talked to him.

19:25.230 --> 19:27.836
Another fascinating
edition of CTMTS.

19:28.267 --> 19:30.508
We may never know conclusively
which way works better.

19:30.669 --> 19:32.046
But I do know this,

19:32.104 --> 19:34.607
when we first started
the seminar, I hoped to

19:34.740 --> 19:37.243
be able to engage
you in the process.

19:37.643 --> 19:39.350
And by that
measure I succeeded.

19:39.411 --> 19:43.120
And I predicted that I would
learn nothing from this process.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.386
Mission accomplished.

19:46.451 --> 19:47.623
What did April write?

19:47.753 --> 19:49.289
Where is April?

19:51.990 --> 19:54.527
"I will pit Ron and
Chris against each other.

19:54.626 --> 19:56.299
"They'll argue
about dumb stuff..."

19:56.361 --> 19:58.272
<i>APR“; ...that doesn't
matter, and I will bail.</i>

19:58.330 --> 20:02.210
<i>Then I'll steal $20 from Chris's
wallet and buy pizza with Andy.</i>

20:02.267 --> 20:05.043
<i>Oh. and I'll also steal
Ron's watch, just for fun.</i>

20:06.038 --> 20:08.177
I think April will
be a fine manager.

20:08.840 --> 20:09.944
I agree.

20:10.008 --> 20:11.817
It's my favorite
kind of battle.

20:12.244 --> 20:14.781
Two men enter,
one me leaves.

20:15.647 --> 20:18.253
BEN: Happy Waffle Day.
ANN: Happy Breakfast Day.

20:18.317 --> 20:19.955
Oh, my God!

20:20.285 --> 20:23.596
You guys, this is the best Breakfast
Day/Waffle Day joint present

20:23.655 --> 20:25.532
I have ever received.

20:25.724 --> 20:27.601
Wow. Thank you so much.

20:27.659 --> 20:28.899
You're welcome.

20:28.961 --> 20:31.100
But Ann and I
wanted to tell you

20:31.163 --> 20:32.972
that this is
the last Breakfast Day

20:33.098 --> 20:34.907
and Waffle Day
we'll be celebrating.

20:35.267 --> 20:36.644
Wait, what?

20:36.902 --> 20:38.142
Oh, my God.
You're both dying.

20:38.337 --> 20:41.443
No, no. We just can't keep up
with all the anniversaries.

20:41.640 --> 20:43.813
It's too much, especially
'cause you're so good at them.

20:43.875 --> 20:45.445
I'm no better at
them than you are.

20:45.510 --> 20:47.490
That's ridiculous, I'm so much better.
Point taken.

20:47.846 --> 20:49.223
But we have
a compromise.

20:49.281 --> 20:51.420
Every year, there will
be one day, Ann Day,

20:51.550 --> 20:53.723
where you can celebrate
all of Ann's holidays

20:53.785 --> 20:56.925
and Ben Day, where we can
celebrate all of ours.

20:57.189 --> 20:59.135
What about Ann
Month and Ben Month?

20:59.858 --> 21:01.064
How about a week?

21:02.094 --> 21:03.164
Fine.

21:03.328 --> 21:06.468
We went in with a day, figuring
she'd counter with a month.

21:06.531 --> 21:08.533
We were fine
with a week.

21:09.968 --> 21:12.346
But there will be a third week.
It will be called Friend Week.

21:12.404 --> 21:14.281
It will be commemorating
this week,

21:14.339 --> 21:15.750
the week that my
two best friends

21:15.874 --> 21:17.285
became each
other's best friends.

21:17.342 --> 21:18.946
I have a Friend Week present
for you right now.

21:19.011 --> 21:20.149
Here you go.

21:20.312 --> 21:22.519
How did you
already have these?

21:22.581 --> 21:24.026
BEN: Thank you.
ANN: Thanks.
