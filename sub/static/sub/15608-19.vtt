(SIGHS) Yes,
but I'm keeping them,

02:03.040 --> 02:05.210
because we're playing poker,
not Go Fish.

02:06.290 --> 02:07.830

I fold, too.

Guys, guess what?

I just found out
I don't have to go to juvie
after camp is over!

02:20.330 --> 02:22.330
Really?
That's great, Griff!

02:22.330 --> 02:23.620
Congratulations!

02:23.620 --> 02:27.380
Ooh, are they
putting you in the
Witness Protection Program?

02:27.380 --> 02:30.670
No, because
I'm not a witness
to any crime,

02:30.670 --> 02:32.380
other than the ones
you commit in the bathroom.

02:34.380 --> 02:37.080
Ah, I get it.

02:37.080 --> 02:38.330
You can't talk about it.

02:38.330 --> 02:40.540
(CHUCKLES)
Because there's nothing
to talk about!

02:40.540 --> 02:41.580
Man, he's good!

02:43.170 --> 02:45.580
So, Griff, why are they
releasing you early?

02:45.580 --> 02:47.290
Because juvie is overcrowded,

02:47.290 --> 02:49.460
so they're sending me
to a group home.

02:49.460 --> 02:51.330
And you are happy
about that?

02:51.330 --> 02:52.290
Of course!

02:52.290 --> 02:54.580
There's no toilet in the
middle of my bedroom,

02:54.580 --> 02:57.290
oh, and you can walk
out the front door
without getting tazed!

02:58.420 --> 02:59.790
That does sound homey.

03:03.670 --> 03:05.250
So, Emma,
in my nightmare,

03:05.250 --> 03:07.000
you were wearing
a court jester costume,

03:07.000 --> 03:08.250
with an ugly
argyle sweater,

03:08.250 --> 03:10.080
and you got punched!

03:10.080 --> 03:12.500
For that fashion choice,
I deserved it.

03:12.500 --> 03:14.380
And then you were
standing in broken glass.

03:14.380 --> 03:16.170
And then, you were running
through the woods

03:16.170 --> 03:18.620
being chased by this
shadowy, menacing creature!

03:18.620 --> 03:20.330
Sounds like
every night in Central Park.

03:22.290 --> 03:24.000
It made this
horrible groaning noise,

03:24.000 --> 03:25.670
and then there was
this bright light,

03:25.670 --> 03:28.330
and then, suddenly,
it grabbed you
and you disappeared!

03:28.330 --> 03:30.250
Ah, Lou,
it was just a dream.

03:30.250 --> 03:32.420
Right, and usually,
I don't remember my dreams.

03:32.420 --> 03:35.080
But when I do,
they always come true.

03:35.080 --> 03:36.580
No, they don't.

03:36.580 --> 03:40.290
You once told me
you had a dream about
Zac Efron kissing you.

03:40.290 --> 03:41.540
That happened!

03:41.540 --> 03:44.960
I have a pig
named Zac Efron.

03:44.960 --> 03:47.380
I fell in the trough,
and he planted a big,
wet one on me.

03:48.170 --> 03:49.580
Ew!
That's horrible!

03:49.580 --> 03:51.540
The horrible part
is he never called.

03:53.170 --> 03:55.290
Yeah,
because he's a pig.

03:55.290 --> 03:56.920
Oh, sure,
make excuses for him.

03:57.710 --> 04:01.000
(GASPS)
Ah, my shirt!

04:01.000 --> 04:03.290
Hey, that was
part of my dream!

04:03.290 --> 04:05.420
I told you
it would come true!

04:05.420 --> 04:08.120
What? You didn't
dream a kid would
bump into Emma

04:08.120 --> 04:09.710
and make her spill
juice on herself.

04:09.710 --> 04:11.210
That wasn't juice.
It was punch.

04:11.210 --> 04:14.210
Emma just got punched.
Just like in my dream!

04:14.210 --> 04:16.170
Well, in your dream,
did you get me a napkin?

04:19.250 --> 04:22.620
You know, I have this
weird recurring dream
where I'm bowling.

04:22.620 --> 04:24.000
What's so weird
about that?

04:24.000 --> 04:26.330
My ball is
Albert Einstein's head.

04:26.330 --> 04:29.670
And every time I put
my thumb in the hole,
he bites me.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.620
E equals MC yikes!

04:37.500 --> 04:39.210
Ha! Your turn.

04:43.330 --> 04:44.540
Ha! I win.

04:45.960 --> 04:48.620
Jorge, that is not
how you play the game.

04:48.620 --> 04:50.040
I know, but I was bored.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.620
Excuse me,
I'm Mr. Gribbly,

04:52.620 --> 04:54.290
from Moose Rump
County Services.

04:54.290 --> 04:56.120
I'm here to pick up
Griff Jones.

04:57.040 --> 04:58.580
You're kind of skinny.

04:58.580 --> 05:01.040
I'm not sure
you can lift him.

05:01.040 --> 05:03.580
Look, kid,
I'm not in the mood
for jokes.

05:03.580 --> 05:06.290
I had to walk five miles
from town to get here.

05:06.290 --> 05:07.750
Why did you walk?

05:07.750 --> 05:11.420
Because the county's
transportation budget is zero.

05:11.420 --> 05:15.120
I got thrown off the bus
when they discovered
I paid with a button.

05:15.120 --> 05:16.420
And now
my shirt looks weird.

05:18.920 --> 05:22.380
Wow, it sounds like the
county has even less money
than this camp.

05:22.380 --> 05:26.330
When we play baseball,
home plate is an actual plate.

05:26.330 --> 05:29.120
Well, at least
you get to work
in the fresh air.

05:29.120 --> 05:32.960
I'm stuck in my teeny
tiny cubicle all day.

05:32.960 --> 05:36.040
It just makes me want to
staple my hand to my desk

05:36.040 --> 05:39.290
over, and over,
and over again.

05:39.290 --> 05:41.170
Good thing
they won't pay for staplers.

05:42.460 --> 05:45.040
I can get you a stapler
from Arts and Crafts,

05:45.040 --> 05:46.580
and you could use
one of our tables.

05:47.210 --> 05:48.380
Jorge!

05:48.380 --> 05:49.290
What? I want to see that.

05:51.250 --> 05:53.120
So, where is this Griff kid?

05:53.120 --> 05:54.750
I'm here to take him
back to juvie.

05:54.750 --> 05:56.250
Juvie?

05:56.250 --> 05:58.330
But I thought he was
going into a group home,

05:58.330 --> 05:59.920
because juvie
was overcrowded?

05:59.920 --> 06:01.210
Not anymore.

06:01.210 --> 06:04.000
A kid escaped, so now
we have a cot available.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.080
By the way, keep on the
lookout for a 12-year-old

06:07.080 --> 06:09.790
with an orange jumpsuit
and a mustache.

06:09.790 --> 06:11.620
A 12-year-old
with a mustache?

06:11.620 --> 06:14.120
Yes. And be careful,
she's mean.

06:22.080 --> 06:25.460
That toilet you sent me to
was just a tree stump.

06:25.460 --> 06:28.080
That was one
unhappy chipmunk.

06:28.080 --> 06:30.750
Mr. Gribbly, why do you
have to take Griff today?

06:30.750 --> 06:32.460
There's still a week
of camp left.

06:32.460 --> 06:36.250
Look, all I know is,
they want me to
pick him up today,

06:36.250 --> 06:38.290
and if I don't do
what I'm told,

06:38.290 --> 06:39.620
they'll demote me
to Crossing Guard.

06:40.830 --> 06:42.500
I cannot wear
that vest again.

06:42.500 --> 06:45.500
Which, FYI, does not keep
people from trying to hit you!

06:47.250 --> 06:48.710
Tell me about it.

06:48.710 --> 06:51.250
I barely survived
three days
as a hall monitor.

06:52.250 --> 06:55.080
They kicked me
in the sash.

06:55.080 --> 06:57.080
Could you at least
let us break the news
to our friend,

06:57.080 --> 06:59.420
and give us a little time
to say goodbye?

06:59.420 --> 07:02.710
I suppose so,
but make it snappy.

07:02.710 --> 07:05.750
I need to make it home
in time for me
and my cat, Muffles,

07:05.750 --> 07:07.670
to watch Madame Wanda:
Pet Therapist.

07:08.790 --> 07:10.620
Ooh, I love that show!

07:10.620 --> 07:13.120
It helped my pet turtle
come out of his shell.

07:13.120 --> 07:16.040
They are not supposed to
come out of their shell.

07:16.040 --> 07:19.380
Yeah, I found that out.

07:19.380 --> 07:22.830
Which scored us
an appearance on
Doctor Steve: Pet Embalmer.

07:24.120 --> 07:25.710
What channel is this?

07:29.750 --> 07:32.170
(FUSSES) That was my
last clean sweatshirt.

07:32.170 --> 07:35.460
Now I have nothing to wear
but a hideous sweater.

07:35.460 --> 07:37.960
Wow, that is the
Hazel of sweaters.

07:37.960 --> 07:41.250
It's loud, weird,
and I want to run from it.

07:41.250 --> 07:43.210
It's from
my crazy Aunt Eileen.

07:43.210 --> 07:45.330
She gives the worst presents.

07:45.330 --> 07:46.460
Not to me.

07:46.460 --> 07:50.120
I gave all our relatives
strict instructions.

07:50.120 --> 07:53.620
Presents not in the
form of cash, check,
or precious metals,

07:53.620 --> 07:55.120
will be returned
to sender.

07:57.330 --> 07:58.920
Wait a minute...

07:58.920 --> 08:01.120
That's the sweater
you were wearing
in my dream!

08:02.290 --> 08:04.170
Really?

08:04.170 --> 08:05.170
That's weird.

08:05.170 --> 08:07.330
What?
No, it's not.

08:07.330 --> 08:09.420
Lou was aware
of the sweater's existence,

08:09.420 --> 08:12.250
therefore it was
already embedded
in her subconscious,

08:12.250 --> 08:15.380
and manifested itself
in a nocturnal epiphenomenon.

08:15.380 --> 08:17.000
I was gonna
say the same thing,

08:17.000 --> 08:19.460
just, you know,
without sounding like
I swallowed a dictionary.

08:23.040 --> 08:24.330
ZURI: Uh-oh...

08:24.330 --> 08:26.080
Broken glass!

08:26.080 --> 08:28.080
And Emma
is standing in it.

08:28.080 --> 08:30.420
Just like you dreamed!

08:30.420 --> 08:32.960
Your dream is
really coming true.

08:32.960 --> 08:35.540
Zuri, don't tell me
you actually believe this.

08:35.540 --> 08:38.620
I'm telling ya'll,
heed my dream warnings.

08:39.460 --> 08:41.040
My Uncle Skeeter didn't,

08:41.040 --> 08:44.170
and he got hit by a flying bat
and lost his ear!

08:44.170 --> 08:45.750
Ew, that's horrible!

08:45.750 --> 08:47.080
Was he in a cave?

08:47.080 --> 08:49.920
No, a Minor League
Baseball game.

08:49.920 --> 08:52.710
The batter lost his grip
and let her fly.

08:52.710 --> 08:55.460
Knocked Skeeter's ear
right into his nachos.

08:57.290 --> 08:59.330
Forget about your
stupid dream.

08:59.330 --> 09:00.880
This sweater is
the real nightmare.

09:06.170 --> 09:07.170
XANDER: Hey, Griff,

09:08.080 --> 09:10.120
we need to
talk to you.

09:10.120 --> 09:12.210
I am afraid we
have some bad news.

09:12.210 --> 09:14.380
Did the lake
catch on fire again?

09:14.380 --> 09:16.290
(SCOFFS)
That's not so bad.

09:16.290 --> 09:18.080
At least when you catch the
fish, they're already cooked.

09:19.670 --> 09:21.500
It's not about
the lake.

09:21.500 --> 09:24.920
We just found out that
you have to go back
to juvie after all.

09:26.080 --> 09:27.500
What?

09:27.500 --> 09:29.040
How do you know?

09:29.040 --> 09:31.500
There is a Mr. Gribbly
here from County Services.

09:31.500 --> 09:32.710
He said he has
to take you back.

09:33.210 --> 09:34.420
Now?

09:34.420 --> 09:36.170
But there's still a week
left of camp!

09:36.170 --> 09:38.500
We told him that,
but he doesn't care.

09:38.500 --> 09:39.920
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

09:39.920 --> 09:41.460
GRIBBLY: Okay, you've had
time for goodbyes.

09:43.210 --> 09:46.040
Wait! I think
I have an idea
of how to fix this.

09:46.040 --> 09:48.380
Ooh, is it to
fill Griff up with helium

09:48.380 --> 09:50.380
so he can float away?

09:50.380 --> 09:53.040
Let's call that
Plan F.

09:53.040 --> 09:55.960
My plan is,
Griff should hide while
I try to figure this out.

09:55.960 --> 09:57.580
(KNOCKING CONTINUES)

09:57.580 --> 09:59.080
Hide in
Mrs. Kipling's cage!

09:59.080 --> 10:00.170
What?

10:00.170 --> 10:01.290
It is safe in there.

10:01.290 --> 10:02.540
She is at Tai chi
until 4:00.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.210
Okay,
where's Griff?

10:09.210 --> 10:10.710
I've got to go.

10:10.710 --> 10:12.670
Sorry,
Griff's not in here.

10:12.670 --> 10:13.750
Really?

10:13.750 --> 10:15.620
Then you won't mind
if I take a quick look.

10:18.460 --> 10:19.580
Oh, my goodness.

10:19.580 --> 10:21.120
And I thought that
tree stump was bad.

10:24.830 --> 10:27.000
Well, I guess
he's not here.

10:27.580 --> 10:29.080
A-ha!

10:29.080 --> 10:31.330
(GROANS)
Threw out my shoulder!

10:36.250 --> 10:38.540
Did you really think
Griff was hiding in there?

10:38.540 --> 10:39.670
It's juvie.

10:39.670 --> 10:42.330
Those tiny criminals
can hide anywhere.

10:42.330 --> 10:43.620
Like in there.

10:43.620 --> 10:45.380
Oh, I would not
do that.

10:45.380 --> 10:48.880
That is the domicile
of my giant pet lizard.

10:48.880 --> 10:50.580
She loves finger food...

10:50.580 --> 10:51.920
And by that,
I mean fingers.

10:53.880 --> 10:57.920
Well, I feel like
you guys know more
than you're letting on.

10:57.920 --> 10:59.080
Well, not that one.

11:05.670 --> 11:07.000
(COUGHS)

11:07.000 --> 11:09.500
Okay, Xander,
your plan better be good,

11:09.500 --> 11:12.330
because I'm not spending
my last week of camp hiding

11:12.330 --> 11:13.960
in a pile of mouse bones,

11:13.960 --> 11:15.250
and what I hope
is not a human toe.

11:16.380 --> 11:17.790
Just trust me.

11:17.790 --> 11:19.170
I have gotta go
make some calls.

11:19.170 --> 11:22.460
Ravi and Jorge,
you two do whatever you can
to stall Mr. Gribbly.

11:22.460 --> 11:25.210
On it. I'll ask him
where babies come from.

11:25.210 --> 11:30.080
It usually takes people
about 40 minutes
just to stop saying, "Uh..."

11:35.290 --> 11:36.830
Okay, Zuri,
now that you're a believer,

11:36.830 --> 11:39.250
we should take turns
guarding Emma
while she sleeps.

11:39.250 --> 11:41.290
Great.
How about you start,

11:41.290 --> 11:43.290
and I'll relieve you
around 8:00 a.m.

11:44.620 --> 11:45.750
(SCREAMS)

11:45.750 --> 11:47.750
Have you looked
in the mirror?

11:47.750 --> 11:49.170
It's Emma.

11:49.170 --> 11:51.670
She can't go 30 seconds
without checking
her reflection.

11:51.670 --> 11:53.250
That's not true.

11:56.330 --> 11:59.750
Emma, why are you dressed
just like you were
in my nightmare?

11:59.750 --> 12:02.500
To prove to you
that this whole
dream thing is nonsense.

12:02.500 --> 12:05.170
Emma, you
can't mess with destiny.

12:05.170 --> 12:07.380
There's no such thing
as destiny!

12:07.380 --> 12:09.210
That's just how
simple-minded people

12:09.210 --> 12:11.670
explain the random
occurrences of life.

12:11.670 --> 12:13.380
Destiny brought
Xander and me together.

12:13.380 --> 12:16.120
See?

12:16.120 --> 12:19.330
So, Emma and I are going
to the woods to prove,
once and for all,

12:19.330 --> 12:22.250
that Lou's dream is
not going to come true.

12:22.250 --> 12:24.620
Then maybe you'll see
that you're being ridiculous.

12:28.380 --> 12:30.620
Yeah, we're the
ridiculous ones.

12:31.580 --> 12:33.290
We can't let her do this.

12:33.290 --> 12:34.420
You can't.

12:34.420 --> 12:35.670
My shift starts
tomorrow morning.

12:41.460 --> 12:43.210
(BOTH LAUGHING)

12:43.210 --> 12:47.670
I can't believe
we ditched Gribbly
in that abandoned mine.

12:47.670 --> 12:49.330
Yes, when we
see him again,

12:49.330 --> 12:51.580
he will either be
very angry, or very rich.

12:53.290 --> 12:56.210
I can't stay in that cage
for one more second!

12:56.210 --> 12:57.540
It smells like death,

12:57.540 --> 12:59.830
I'm freaking out about
going back to juvie,

12:59.830 --> 13:03.880
and that upside down
water bottle keeps dripping
on my forehead!

13:03.880 --> 13:05.710
That is not water.
That is liquefied crickets.

13:06.620 --> 13:07.750
Great.

13:07.750 --> 13:09.330
Could this
day get any worse?

13:10.540 --> 13:12.170
(GASPS)
There's Gribbly!

13:12.170 --> 13:13.170
(GASPS) Hide!

13:16.710 --> 13:17.830
GRIBBLY: Hey!

13:17.830 --> 13:19.620
I can't believe
you two abandoned me.

13:19.620 --> 13:21.250
There was a cave-in,

13:21.250 --> 13:24.330
and I had to dig myself out
using my ID card.

13:24.330 --> 13:26.710
They're going to charge me
five dollars to replace that.

13:28.120 --> 13:29.170
Abandoned you?

13:29.170 --> 13:31.290
Why ever
would you think that?

13:31.290 --> 13:33.830
Because this one yelled,
"See ya, sucker!"

13:34.710 --> 13:38.670
No, I said, "See...
A sucker!"

13:38.670 --> 13:39.750
(CELL PHONE DINGS)

13:41.580 --> 13:42.960
Good one.

13:42.960 --> 13:45.000
But how did you happen
to have that in your pocket?

13:45.000 --> 13:47.170
I have a lot of things
in my pocket.

13:47.170 --> 13:51.290
I also could've gone with,
"See, a half-eaten pancake!"

13:54.080 --> 13:55.580
I don't know
what's going on here,

13:55.580 --> 13:58.330
but since Griff
is clearly trying
to elude the authorities,

13:58.330 --> 14:01.330
I'm going to recommend he get
even more time in juvie!

14:01.330 --> 14:02.880
What?
You cannot do that!

14:09.250 --> 14:12.250
So the answer
to the question,

14:12.250 --> 14:15.000
"Is there any place
more disgusting than
Kipling's cage?"

14:15.000 --> 14:16.170
Is, "Yes".

14:26.670 --> 14:28.960
It's impossible to get
cell phone service
around here.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.120
Stupid radioactive lake.

14:32.420 --> 14:33.540
Okay.

14:33.540 --> 14:34.920
Whoa.

14:34.920 --> 14:36.380
Since I last saw you,

14:36.380 --> 14:38.330
I have crawled through
a caved-in mine,

14:38.330 --> 14:40.460
and opened every
dresser drawer in this camp,

14:40.460 --> 14:42.380
and I still can't find Griff.

14:42.380 --> 14:43.920
I know you know
where he is.

14:44.210 --> 14:45.830
Um...

14:45.830 --> 14:48.210
I have no idea
where Griff is.

14:48.210 --> 14:50.290
My campers
tend to wander off.

14:50.290 --> 14:52.960
Oh, then you must be
Counselor of the Year.

14:54.710 --> 14:57.580
Actually, I think I know
where he might be.

14:57.580 --> 14:59.330
He's probably down
at the dump.

14:59.330 --> 15:01.460
Why would he
be down there?

15:01.460 --> 15:04.710
He... Uh,
he needs parts.

15:04.710 --> 15:06.380
He's making a robot.

15:06.380 --> 15:08.080
Yeah,
don't tell anyone,

15:08.080 --> 15:10.830
but I think he's
building an army.

15:10.830 --> 15:14.080
If he's going to use it
to destroy this camp,
I'm all for it.

15:19.250 --> 15:20.830
Okay, shadowy figure!

15:20.830 --> 15:22.120
I'm here!

15:22.120 --> 15:23.380
Come and get me!

15:23.380 --> 15:24.540
(CHUCKLES)
Emma, stop it!

15:24.540 --> 15:26.120
This isn't funny.

15:26.120 --> 15:29.170
Yeah, I can't believe
you're tempting fate
like this!

15:29.170 --> 15:30.170
Oh, come on,

15:30.170 --> 15:32.170
the only thing I'm tempting
is the Fashion Police.

15:33.290 --> 15:35.330
Okay, so,
here we are.

15:35.330 --> 15:36.330
We're in the woods,

15:36.330 --> 15:38.920
Emma looks exactly
as she did in Lou's dream,

15:38.920 --> 15:40.960
and nothing
has happened!

15:40.960 --> 15:43.500
Face it, there's
no such thing as fate.

15:43.500 --> 15:46.170
The shadowy figure
is not coming.

15:46.170 --> 15:48.040
(EERIE GROANING)
(ALL GASP)

15:48.040 --> 15:50.750
(WHIMPERING) Lou,
wasn't there groaning
in your dream?

15:50.750 --> 15:52.420
Scary groaning.

15:52.420 --> 15:54.210
(GASPS)
And a bright light?

15:54.210 --> 15:55.210
(WHINING IN HIGH-PITCH)
Scary bright!

15:56.250 --> 15:58.000
Lou's dream
is coming true.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.330
That thing
is gonna get me.

15:59.330 --> 16:00.420
What do we do?

16:00.420 --> 16:02.620
Well, I'm gonna start of
by saying I told you so.

16:09.620 --> 16:12.170
Lou, in your dream,
what happened after
the thing grabbed me?

16:12.170 --> 16:13.330
I don't know.
I woke up!

16:13.330 --> 16:15.210
Well, fall back asleep
and find out.

16:15.210 --> 16:18.750
It's a little hard
to fall asleep
under these circumstances!

16:18.750 --> 16:20.120
Tell me a story?

16:21.380 --> 16:22.460
Once upon a time...

16:22.460 --> 16:23.920
Your best friend
was killed in the woods.

16:23.920 --> 16:25.750
The end.
Go to sleep!

16:25.750 --> 16:26.830
(BEAST GROWLS)

16:26.830 --> 16:27.830
(ALL SCREAM)

16:29.210 --> 16:30.880
Wait, you're not the one
I'm looking for!

16:30.880 --> 16:32.040
You're right.

16:33.710 --> 16:34.920
She is.

16:35.710 --> 16:38.540
That's just cold.

16:38.540 --> 16:42.170
No, I'm Mr. Gribbly,
from Moose Rump
County Services.

16:42.170 --> 16:43.620
I'm looking for
Griff Jones.

16:43.620 --> 16:46.210
I heard whispering
over here, and I thought
it might be him.

16:46.790 --> 16:47.920
Oh.

16:47.920 --> 16:49.290
Sorry, Zuri.

16:49.290 --> 16:50.080
Mmm-hmm.

16:52.210 --> 16:54.380
We thought you were
a hideous creature.

16:54.380 --> 16:56.210
Thanks. You should
write birthday cards.

16:57.330 --> 16:58.710
And if you must know,

16:58.710 --> 17:01.080
I've just been crawling
around the town dump.

17:01.080 --> 17:05.120
Which, by the way,
is in better shape
than that camp.

17:05.120 --> 17:06.830
But why were
you groaning?

17:06.830 --> 17:08.920
Because I hate my life.

17:10.250 --> 17:12.540
I told you guys
this was all silly.

17:12.540 --> 17:14.380
I wasn't scared
for a second.

17:14.380 --> 17:15.330
You were so!

17:15.330 --> 17:16.960
You were screaming
like a hyena.

17:16.960 --> 17:18.500
I was not.

17:18.500 --> 17:21.500
That's just
how I say hi
to strangers.

17:21.500 --> 17:24.380
(YELLS) Hi!

17:24.380 --> 17:26.210
You guys are weird.

17:26.210 --> 17:30.290
And I'm not even going to ask
why this one is dressed like
a preppy court jester.

17:30.290 --> 17:32.250
It all started with this
spooky dream that I...

17:32.250 --> 17:34.710
Ooh, I had a really
spooky dream once.

17:34.710 --> 17:38.040
I was bowling with
Albert Einstein's head.

17:38.040 --> 17:40.420
(SCOFFS)
Who's the weird one now?

17:41.250 --> 17:42.080
Still you.

17:48.170 --> 17:49.670
Well, boys,
I didn't find Griff,

17:49.670 --> 17:52.330
but I did find four
more troublemakers.

17:52.330 --> 17:53.620
Oh, they're troublemakers.

17:53.620 --> 17:55.080
I'm actually delightful.

17:56.420 --> 17:59.120
Emma,
what are you wearing?

17:59.120 --> 18:01.120
Oh, I have that
exact same sweater.

18:01.120 --> 18:03.210
Aunt Eileen gives
the coolest presents.

18:03.210 --> 18:04.540
Enough chit-chat.

18:04.540 --> 18:07.380
I've got to find Griff
and get him back to juvie.

18:07.380 --> 18:09.420
And then I'm going to
call your parents

18:09.420 --> 18:12.380
and tell them you've
been interfering with
a government official.

18:12.380 --> 18:15.170
No, please don't call
my mother.

18:15.170 --> 18:18.120
Uh, but if you do,
ask her to send Jorge
more underwear.

18:18.120 --> 18:19.670
He ran out a month ago.

18:19.670 --> 18:21.500
Two, if you do not count
inside-outsies.

18:23.080 --> 18:25.250
Please don't
get my brother in trouble.

18:25.250 --> 18:29.250
My parents will
take away his Museum
of Natural History card.

18:29.250 --> 18:32.290
That cave woman
is the closest thing
he has to a girlfriend.

18:33.250 --> 18:34.830
Lucy just gets me.

18:36.080 --> 18:37.170
Wait.

18:37.170 --> 18:39.330
I don't want anyone else
to get in trouble.

18:39.330 --> 18:41.210
Well, look who it is!

18:41.210 --> 18:43.170
Moose Rump's Most Wanted.

18:43.170 --> 18:45.500
Well, at least since
they caught that guy
who kept double-parking.

18:46.620 --> 18:49.120
Look, I'm sorry
I was hiding earlier.

18:49.120 --> 18:52.080
But I'm ready
to go now,

18:52.080 --> 18:54.580
just please leave
my friends out of this.

18:54.580 --> 18:56.040
They were
just trying to help.

18:56.040 --> 18:59.040
I wish they'd helped me
when that mine caved in.

18:59.040 --> 19:00.670
I don't do mud,

19:00.670 --> 19:03.170
unless Muffles and I
are having a spa day.

19:04.710 --> 19:06.420
Is Muffles
your wife?

19:06.420 --> 19:08.380
No, my feline soulmate.

19:10.620 --> 19:11.920
Let's go.

19:11.920 --> 19:13.500
I never thought
I'd miss my cubicle,

19:13.500 --> 19:15.420
but this camp
has managed to do that.

19:15.420 --> 19:17.250
Griff,

19:17.250 --> 19:19.120
we're so sorry
you have to go.

19:19.120 --> 19:20.620
It's just not fair.

19:20.620 --> 19:22.420
It's okay, guys.

19:22.420 --> 19:24.670
Don't feel bad.

19:24.670 --> 19:27.120
Hanging out with you
this summer has been
the best time of my life.

19:29.120 --> 19:30.880
It was like
a dream come true.

19:30.880 --> 19:32.880
Just like
my dream came true!

19:32.880 --> 19:34.540
(CHUCKLES)

19:34.540 --> 19:37.080
Okay, not the time.
I get that.

19:38.620 --> 19:42.580
But like all dreams,
you have to wake up
sometime.

19:45.120 --> 19:47.500
I would say
I'll see you guys later,

19:47.500 --> 19:49.540
but I think we
all know that's not true.

19:52.330 --> 19:53.330
XANDER: Wait!

19:53.330 --> 19:55.880
Ugh! Madame Wanda
starts in an hour!

19:55.880 --> 19:58.790
Do none of you understand
the definition
of appointment TV?

20:00.380 --> 20:02.290
Griff, I just got off
the phone.

20:02.290 --> 20:06.250
And I think I found a way
for you not to have to
go back to juvie!

20:06.250 --> 20:08.210
What are you
talking about?

20:08.210 --> 20:10.620
Well, you know how
you're always saying

20:10.620 --> 20:12.040
how much you
look up to me

20:12.040 --> 20:14.460
and that I'm kind of
like a big brother to you?

20:14.460 --> 20:17.080
I've, literally,
never said
anything like that.

20:19.250 --> 20:20.620
Oh.

20:20.620 --> 20:25.290
But I've thought it,
every single day,

20:25.290 --> 20:28.290
because you're the one
who took a chance on me,

20:28.290 --> 20:29.080
and let me come to camp.

20:31.210 --> 20:34.540
I mean, you're the closest
thing to a big brother
I've ever had.

20:34.540 --> 20:36.120
I'm glad
you feel that way,

20:36.120 --> 20:39.170
because I just talked
to my parents and...

20:39.170 --> 20:41.210
We want you to
come live with us.

20:41.210 --> 20:43.790
Wait a minute, young man,
you can't just do that.

20:43.790 --> 20:47.210
You can if your dad
used to play football
with the governor.

20:47.210 --> 20:48.790
Then I guess
you can do that.

20:50.040 --> 20:51.170
Are you serious?

20:51.170 --> 20:53.170
Yes! I mean,
if it's okay with you.

20:54.170 --> 20:56.330
Wow...
This is crazy.

20:56.330 --> 20:57.710
I... I don't know
what to say!

20:57.710 --> 20:58.710
Say yes!

20:59.380 --> 21:00.210
Yes!

21:03.710 --> 21:05.080
Thank you,
Xander.

21:05.080 --> 21:07.290
You're welcome,
little bruh.

21:08.500 --> 21:10.210
We're so happy
for you, Griff.

21:10.210 --> 21:11.460
Me too!

21:12.330 --> 21:15.210
Wait, you are happy?

21:15.210 --> 21:18.210
I did not think
that was possible.

21:18.210 --> 21:21.580
Hey, it's really touching
how much you all
love your friend.

21:21.580 --> 21:23.380
I haven't been
this moved

21:23.380 --> 21:27.120
since Madame Wanda
talked all those lemmings out
of going over that cliff.

21:28.670 --> 21:30.330
Good luck
in your new home.

21:30.330 --> 21:32.250
Thank you,
Mr. Gribbly.

21:32.250 --> 21:33.540
This is awesome!
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

21:33.540 --> 21:37.080
Wait, so you're
not gonna punish Griff
for hiding,

21:37.080 --> 21:39.330
or us for helping him?

21:39.330 --> 21:42.540
Nah. You guys
spent all summer
at this camp.

21:42.540 --> 21:43.960
That's punishment enough.

21:49.960 --> 21:51.880
Hey, Zuri.
What ya got there?

21:51.880 --> 21:55.250
My Aunt Eileen sent me
an early birthday present.

21:55.250 --> 21:57.120
I hope she got me
something good this year!

22:00.040 --> 22:01.250
Gold bars?

22:01.250 --> 22:02.500
I know!

22:02.500 --> 22:03.750
Again?

22:03.750 --> 22:04.920
Boring.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.120
Lou, do you want these?

22:08.120 --> 22:10.290
Does a cow
like to be milked
counter-clockwise

22:10.290 --> 22:12.210
on Valentine's Day?

22:12.210 --> 22:13.580
I have no idea.

22:14.880 --> 22:17.040
Yes! Yes, I will
take the gold bars.

22:17.040 --> 22:19.670
(GASPING)
I'm rich, rich, rich!

22:19.670 --> 22:22.620
Rich, rich, rich, rich!

22:23.120 --> 22:24.290
Lou!

22:24.290 --> 22:25.960
Who's Rich,
and when are we
gonna meet him?

22:27.380 --> 22:29.210
Zuri,

22:29.210 --> 22:31.380
is that a package
from your Aunt Eileen?

22:31.380 --> 22:32.710
Yes.

22:32.710 --> 22:34.750
Is it an early
birthday present?

22:34.750 --> 22:35.960
Yes.

22:35.960 --> 22:37.210
(WHINING)
Is it gold bars?

22:39.420 --> 22:40.790
Yes!

22:40.790 --> 22:42.790
And you're gonna
give them to me?

22:42.790 --> 22:43.880
Not a chance.
