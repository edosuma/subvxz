00:29.160 --> 00:31.520
Isn't it a bit fucked up,
wearing his clothes?

00:39.360 --> 00:41.960
I think the fucked-up bit
was murdering him.

01:01.200 --> 01:02.040
Sorry.

01:02.680 --> 01:03.640
It's OK.

01:04.400 --> 01:05.600
Should we go to the police?

01:06.280 --> 01:07.120
What?

01:09.200 --> 01:10.240
It was self-defense.

01:12.200 --> 01:15.160
-We broke into his house, James.
-Yeah, he was gonna hurt you.

01:15.720 --> 01:17.160
You think they're gonna believe that? It's the truth.

01:18.760 --> 01:20.640
<i> Alyssa seemed weirdly calm.</i>

01:21.320 --> 01:22.520
<i> Fuck. Fuck!</i>

01:22.600 --> 01:24.200
We need to get rid of the body.

01:27.160 --> 01:28.040
Come on.

01:29.240 --> 01:30.240
James!

01:31.640 --> 01:32.600
Sorry.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.720
One, two, three!

01:43.000 --> 01:44.240
Shit.

01:44.600 --> 01:45.640
Again.

01:45.880 --> 01:47.560
One, two, three!

01:52.840 --> 01:55.680
Dead people are heavier
than alive people. I read that.

01:56.800 --> 01:57.840
Good to know.

02:00.600 --> 02:02.440
We need to clean everything up.

02:02.520 --> 02:04.760
We need to get rid of any trace of us.

02:05.320 --> 02:06.560
Do you hear me, James?

02:07.400 --> 02:08.479
Do you understand?

02:09.280 --> 02:11.040
No one can know that we've been here, OK?

02:12.120 --> 02:14.320
If we can't get rid of him,
we got to get rid of us.

02:14.400 --> 02:15.880
Go find some bleach.

02:18.360 --> 02:21.160
Take your shoes off!
And clean up that blood.

02:23.960 --> 02:27.040
<i> This is bad.</i>
<i>This is really fucking bad.</i>

02:28.400 --> 02:30.560
<i> Alyssa seemed to know</i>
<i>what she was doing.</i>

02:30.640 --> 02:33.120
<i>I figured that,</i>
<i>if I just did what I was told,</i>

02:33.200 --> 02:34.640
<i>then it might be all right.</i>

02:36.080 --> 02:38.640
<i> I don't know</i>
<i>if this is the right thing to be doing.</i>

02:39.240 --> 02:42.680
<i>I'm just thinking about what people</i>
<i>on the TV do when they've done this.</i>

02:44.000 --> 02:46.440
<i> She said it'd help</i>
<i>to have music on whilst we cleaned.</i>

06:23.640 --> 06:24.480

07:23.040 --> 07:24.240

07:32.560 --> 07:33.400
James?

07:36.960 --> 07:37.800
James!

07:37.880 --> 07:39.160
We should wait for a bit.

07:39.880 --> 07:40.880
What

07:41.840 --> 07:44.560
If we get this one, we're traveling peak.

07:47.600 --> 07:48.440
It's more expensive.

07:49.240 --> 07:51.200
<i> I think there's something</i>

<i>What if someone recognizes us?</i>

08:10.720 --> 08:11.800
<i>Fuck!</i>

08:14.280 --> 08:16.200
We need to change the way we look.

08:19.080 --> 08:21.640
<i> Turns out James is</i>
<i>quite a good hairdresser.</i>

08:25.120 --> 08:27.200
<i>My mum always wanted me</i>
<i>to go blonde.</i>

08:27.840 --> 08:30.240
<i>Guess she'd be</i>
<i>really fucking pleased with me.</i>

08:33.720 --> 08:35.240
We need new clothes.

08:36.560 --> 08:37.720
<i> Think it's fair to say</i>

08:37.799 --> 08:40.480
<i>that my disguise wasn't</i>
<i>as effective as Alyssa's.</i>

08:41.800 --> 08:43.360
<i>I looked pretty much the same.</i>

08:44.080 --> 08:46.720
Was there not another size?
These are a bit tight.

08:48.200 --> 08:50.560
It was a shit Oxfam.
They had about ten things.

08:50.640 --> 08:53.320
It's not my fault
that you look thinner than you are.

08:55.480 --> 08:57.240
<i> I don't recognize myself.</i>

09:00.040 --> 09:02.320
Jesus. It's so quiet here.

09:19.360 --> 09:21.080
Where did you get the knife from?

09:22.200 --> 09:23.080
What?

09:26.840 --> 09:28.400
The one you killed him with. Was it yours?

Jesus.

10:18.840 --> 10:20.120
Hiya.

10:20.280 --> 10:21.520
Hi.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.320
Brought you this.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.800
It's a crime scene.

10:30.160 --> 10:31.280
-So...
-So...

10:31.840 --> 10:34.320
-Sorry, you go...
-Please, go ahead. Please.

10:34.400 --> 10:37.280
I was just gonna say:
Clive Koch. Late forties.

10:37.360 --> 10:38.520
Clive what?

10:40.000 --> 10:42.080
Koch. Let me just...

10:42.160 --> 10:43.480
Let me see.

10:43.800 --> 10:47.320
K-O-C-H. Probably German.

10:48.480 --> 10:51.280
<i> He was found by his mother.</i>
<i>Late seventies.</i>

10:51.360 --> 10:53.120
<i> God.</i>
<i> Poor thing.</i>

10:53.200 --> 10:55.640
<i> She didn't have a clue</i>
<i>what was going on.</i>

10:56.680 --> 10:57.760
Is that a new coat?

10:59.800 --> 11:00.840
No.

11:02.440 --> 11:03.440
Really nice...

11:04.960 --> 11:05.840
cut.

11:19.640 --> 11:21.160
Fucking hell!

11:22.640 --> 11:23.960
Quite a buff on that.

11:25.360 --> 11:28.120
I found this. Under the bed.

11:30.600 --> 11:31.440
Teri?

11:33.480 --> 11:35.800
You wanna tell us
why we've got your wallet here?

11:35.880 --> 11:38.760
She said she was 17, I swear to you.

11:38.840 --> 11:43.800
I asked. I asked, like, a few times.
She showed me her ID.

11:43.880 --> 11:44.880
It said 17!

11:44.960 --> 11:47.040
-I swear I checked. I promise you!
-Calm down!

11:49.240 --> 11:51.760
OK. Now let me see
if I've got this straight.

11:51.960 --> 11:55.520
You met this girl for the first time
yesterday, completely randomly,

11:55.800 --> 11:57.680
and went back to this house with her.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.520
-No. We never had sex.

11:59.600 --> 12:02.560
The sex or lack thereof is not
why you're here.

12:03.680 --> 12:04.520
What?

12:05.600 --> 12:07.680
You had no idea whose house it was?

12:08.240 --> 12:09.920
What are you talking about The man whose house it was...

12:21.120 --> 12:22.840
He was murdered last night.

12:24.320 --> 12:26.880
Oh. Fuck me, oh...

12:26.960 --> 12:28.880
-this is all just...
-Tell me about the girl.

12:28.960 --> 12:30.320
What was her name?

12:31.760 --> 12:32.680
<i> Alyssa.</i>

12:34.360 --> 12:35.920
Alyssa, what are we going to do?

12:38.200 --> 12:39.880
Are we still going to your dad's?

12:41.960 --> 12:44.120
We should probably eat something.

12:51.720 --> 12:53.920
<i> Alyssa had started</i>
<i>being weird with me.</i>

12:58.840 --> 13:00.200
It was a present from my dad.

13:02.600 --> 13:03.640
The knife.

13:05.760 --> 13:06.680
What's it for? Hunting.

13:10.400 --> 13:13.200
Yeah, 'cause that's a big thing
where we live, isn't it?

13:16.040 --> 13:18.680
Who carries a hunting knife
around with them, James?

13:22.280 --> 13:24.240
<i> I realized</i>
<i>that she was scared of me.</i>

13:26.640 --> 13:28.400
<i>That felt kind of unfair.</i>

13:28.720 --> 13:30.320
<i>I'd been her protector.</i>

13:32.520 --> 13:35.600
<i> Did you notice</i>
<i>anything distinctive about her?</i>

13:35.680 --> 13:37.160
Angry

13:37.880 --> 13:39.480
Almost pretty, but...

13:39.680 --> 13:41.560
actually average.

13:41.640 --> 13:44.000
Do you want to give her
a score out of ten?

13:45.280 --> 13:47.240
-Like, I--
-I'm joking.

13:49.320 --> 13:52.160
Oh, no! No. I mean, like, she's fine.
She's fine.

13:52.240 --> 13:55.360
She's just not, like, a model, you know?

13:56.480 --> 13:57.640
What was she wearing?

13:59.800 --> 14:02.600
Before you undressed her
and tried to have sex with her, I mean.

14:04.240 --> 14:05.760
Just, like, normal.

14:05.840 --> 14:10.720
I dunno. Just jeans.
A t-shirt. And this weird jacket.

14:11.400 --> 14:12.320
Weird, like, how?

14:13.440 --> 14:15.840
It was, like, quite shit.

14:16.520 --> 14:20.880
Weird because it was quite shit,
but sort of cool because it was?

14:21.120 --> 14:22.080
Do you know what I mean?

14:23.280 --> 14:24.120
No.

14:26.480 --> 14:28.160
It was, like, a brown leather jacket.

14:28.240 --> 14:29.680
Sort of baggy on her.

14:31.320 --> 14:33.720
Oh, and it wasn't just her.

14:34.680 --> 14:36.640
In the house.
Yeah, there was another guy, too.

14:37.680 --> 14:38.520
This guy?

14:38.600 --> 14:39.840
No! No, no, no.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.400
He was younger. Um...

14:42.080 --> 14:43.720
Aww, I think his name was...

14:44.640 --> 14:45.680
<i> James?</i>

14:47.160 --> 14:49.920
<i> I decided to put on a calmer,</i>
<i>more relaxed demeanor...</i>

14:51.360 --> 14:52.680
<i>to reassure Alyssa.</i>

14:54.680 --> 14:57.040
<i>There's definitely</i>
<i>something wrong with him.</i>

14:59.360 --> 15:00.360
You OK?

15:00.800 --> 15:01.640
What?

15:03.200 --> 15:04.360
Are you OK?

15:05.160 --> 15:06.000
Yeah.

15:07.120 --> 15:08.440
<i> It didn't work.</i>

15:10.000 --> 15:11.200
What's the matter?

15:12.920 --> 15:14.200
What's the matter?

15:16.040 --> 15:17.360
What's the matter?

15:17.440 --> 15:21.040
The matter, James, is that last night,
you fucking murdered someone.

15:21.800 --> 15:25.600
And every time I try to close my eyes,
or think about anything, anything else,

15:25.680 --> 15:27.720
all I can see is his face...

15:28.600 --> 15:31.520
and his neck, and you stabbing him.

15:33.640 --> 15:34.560
Thanks.

15:38.120 --> 15:39.480
Do you want mustard, too?

15:40.920 --> 15:42.040
On chips?

15:43.120 --> 15:44.280
Some people like it.

16:02.440 --> 16:03.400
Alyssa?

16:03.480 --> 16:04.920
I don't want to hold your hand.

16:09.960 --> 16:11.520
I'm going to the toilet.

16:26.040 --> 16:27.160
Oh.

16:27.760 --> 16:28.960
Sorry.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.360
So, his alibi checks out.

16:32.440 --> 16:34.400
What?

16:35.240 --> 16:37.440
Clive Koch died
between midnight and 3am.

16:37.520 --> 16:40.000
The twat in there was
at a house party during that time.

16:40.080 --> 16:41.680
-Yes.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.240
Lots of other twats.

16:44.560 --> 16:45.400
OK.

16:47.880 --> 16:50.200
Listen, I've been meaning to, um...

16:52.840 --> 16:54.720
Could we have a quick chat at some point?

What about?

16:57.000 --> 16:58.960
Well, you know, I thought...

17:00.160 --> 17:03.960
Should we... talk
about what happened the other night?

17:08.320 --> 17:10.680
You know what? Don't worry about it.

17:13.320 --> 17:15.760
OK, let's put out a request
for any sightings

17:15.840 --> 17:18.680
or any crimes
involving two teenagers in the area.

17:18.760 --> 17:20.200
Give them a description
of the jacket

17:20.280 --> 17:23.040
and put the names Alyssa
and James into Missing Persons.

17:23.680 --> 17:27.359
Either they killed him,
or they might have seen who did.

17:28.720 --> 17:30.120
We need to find them.
