- Previously onGood Witch...
- Between the Lines is

00:03.754 --> 00:06.038
gonna be the biggest thing
in internet matchmaking ever.

00:06.063 --> 00:07.412
- You know he likes you.
- No.

00:07.455 --> 00:08.766
He likes you.

00:08.791 --> 00:11.746
I look forward to every
minute whenever I'm with you,

00:11.808 --> 00:14.114
so stick around. OK?

00:14.158 --> 00:15.455
I'm not going anywhere.

00:15.480 --> 00:16.511
Your English teacher

00:16.554 --> 00:19.380
was just telling me about the
wonderful story you wrote.

00:19.424 --> 00:22.383
Apparently, you have
quite the gift for prose.

00:22.427 --> 00:24.864
- I got some options for dates.
- Sam, I can't wait

00:24.908 --> 00:27.432
to get married, but I don't
know why we have to make

00:27.475 --> 00:29.129
all these decisions now.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074

00:38.501 --> 00:41.025
There's a toy store
at the end of the street

00:41.069 --> 00:43.985
and a place down there
called Nothing but Yarn.

00:44.028 --> 00:45.987
And this is Cassie's shop.

00:46.030 --> 00:48.250
- What does she sell here?
- Don't let the sign

00:48.294 --> 00:50.208
fool you. She's got lots
of books and candles,

00:50.252 --> 00:52.077
but I hardly ever see any bells.

00:54.082 --> 00:56.302
I sell a little bit of everything.

00:56.345 --> 00:58.042
Has your personal tour guide
been showing you

00:58.086 --> 01:00.697
- the best Middleton has to offer?
- Well, I've been showing him

01:00.741 --> 01:03.004
what Middleton has to offer, but
there's not really a best of.

01:03.047 --> 01:04.700
Oh, I've really been
enjoying it, actually.

01:04.745 --> 01:06.964
- You have?
- Oh, yeah. I always hear about

01:07.008 --> 01:10.228
places with small town charm,
but this town actually has it.

01:10.272 --> 01:11.317
Everywhere you look.

01:16.844 --> 01:18.367
And thank you so much

01:18.411 --> 01:19.847
for letting me extend
my stay at Grey House.

01:19.890 --> 01:22.719
Oh, you can have the room
as long as you want it.

01:22.763 --> 01:25.766
And if you want a memento,

01:25.809 --> 01:28.159
I had these made for anyone who
wants to remember their stay.

01:28.203 --> 01:29.944
Oh...

01:29.987 --> 01:33.164
Well, I can see why someone
would want to remember.

01:33.208 --> 01:34.818
I wonder what the mayor wants.

01:34.862 --> 01:36.517
- Who?
- Good morning!

01:36.561 --> 01:39.519
Cassie, I need your advice
and perhaps even Abigail's.

01:39.562 --> 01:41.477
Oh, and you're Mr. Technology,

01:41.521 --> 01:44.393
so maybe you have an opinion too.
I was looking at our city's

01:44.437 --> 01:47.091
website, and I realized
it is woefully out of date.

01:47.135 --> 01:49.355
- Oh, it's not that bad.
- It's embarrassing!

01:49.398 --> 01:51.574
It still has a reference to
how we won Cleanest Streets

01:51.618 --> 01:53.794
two years in a row,
but that was ages ago!

01:53.837 --> 01:56.100
We've actually won it five.

01:56.144 --> 01:58.320
Now, I need someone
to rewrite the sections

01:58.364 --> 02:01.845
- on our town's history.
- Well, you could ask Grace.

02:01.889 --> 02:04.239
That's a good idea.
She proved how great a writer

02:04.282 --> 02:06.676
she is with those Elizabeth
Merriwick stories.

02:06.720 --> 02:09.418
- Who's Elizabeth Merriwick?
- Oh! Now you see,

02:09.461 --> 02:12.203
if our website was more current,
he wouldn't even have to ask.

02:12.247 --> 02:14.597
I can tell Grace to stop by
and talk to you about doing

02:14.641 --> 02:16.643
- the job, if you'd like.
- I'd love.

02:16.686 --> 02:19.428
And now, if you'll all excuse me,
I have to stop by Table Tops

02:19.472 --> 02:21.996
and get some new doilies
for my dining room credenza.

02:23.476 --> 02:26.479
There is a store in
Middleton that sells doilies?

02:26.522 --> 02:28.002
Yep. It's right next

02:28.045 --> 02:30.744
- to Nothing but Yarn.
- What?

02:44.932 --> 02:46.890
Hey.

02:46.934 --> 02:48.892
Are we expecting any guests tomorrow?

02:48.936 --> 02:52.200
- Uh... Not for a few days.
- Good.

02:52.243 --> 02:54.985
I'm going to take this
opportunity to do nothing.

02:55.029 --> 02:57.379
I was gonna suggest you try that.

02:57.423 --> 02:58.641
- Goodnight.
- Night.

03:01.252 --> 03:03.124
Hmm.

03:08.172 --> 03:10.871
Hi, Sam.

03:12.699 --> 03:14.352
Oh. I didn't know
you were working tonight.

03:17.225 --> 03:19.967
I had a little bit of an accident.

03:20.010 --> 03:22.491
Ow! Sorry. It's a little bit
of a muscle strain.

03:27.801 --> 03:29.237
I'll be right there.

03:37.867 --> 03:45.868
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

03:55.785 --> 03:57.874
- Cassie.
- Hi. Sam...

03:57.918 --> 04:00.790
- It's OK. I'm all right.
- What happened?

04:00.834 --> 04:03.358
- He was trying to help me.
- I saw a loose

04:03.401 --> 04:05.969
- shingle on this guy's roof.
- And you know how Sam feels

04:06.013 --> 04:07.710
about things that are out of place.

04:07.754 --> 04:10.017
And I got up there and fixed
it, and then I slipped on

04:10.060 --> 04:13.411
- another one... on my way down.
- You fell off a roof.

04:13.455 --> 04:15.413
Right onto three baby pine trees

04:15.457 --> 04:17.546
- that I had just planted.
- Oh, don't worry about me.

04:17.589 --> 04:19.286
What? You grow back.

04:19.329 --> 04:21.985
It's no big deal, Cassie, really.

04:22.029 --> 04:24.292
So right when we're about
to get married, you decide

04:24.335 --> 04:27.077
you just have to go
crawling around on roofs?

04:27.121 --> 04:29.123
I just don't want you getting
too banged up, that's all.

04:29.166 --> 04:31.995
Well, I'll try to keep
my feet on the ground.

04:36.434 --> 04:38.436
My mom said that you wanted me

04:38.480 --> 04:40.308
- to do some work on the website?
- Oh, yes!

04:40.351 --> 04:42.005
And I think you're the
perfect person for the job.

04:42.049 --> 04:44.355
You love history and you love to write

04:44.399 --> 04:46.009
and this job involves both.

04:46.053 --> 04:48.359
Don't you have people
who work here that take care

04:48.403 --> 04:50.100
- of that kind of stuff?
- Well, there might be someone

04:50.144 --> 04:52.494
in IT, but I can never get them
to stop playing 'Minecrafter'

04:52.538 --> 04:54.888
long enough to pay attention.
Also, this isn't

04:54.931 --> 04:57.020
- really in the budget.
- Hmm.

04:57.064 --> 04:59.414
- I would be happy to volunteer.
- That's what I

04:59.439 --> 05:00.571
was hoping to hear!

05:02.286 --> 05:04.158
- OK.
- Now, there is one

05:04.201 --> 05:06.247
particular section of this website

05:06.290 --> 05:08.815
that always fills me with pride.

05:08.858 --> 05:11.208
It's about my own family, the Endicotts.

05:11.252 --> 05:12.993
Oh, I remember reading about them!

05:13.036 --> 05:15.212
Yes, well Douglas Endicott was hailed

05:15.256 --> 05:18.346
as a hero for saving a family
from a burning building,

05:18.389 --> 05:20.740
carrying each and every one
of them to safety.

05:20.783 --> 05:22.655
They misspelled safety there.

05:22.698 --> 05:25.788
Oh. Well, now you see
why we need your help.

05:25.832 --> 05:27.616
It was that act of bravery

05:27.660 --> 05:30.227
that established my family
as being so prominent

05:30.271 --> 05:32.708
in the community, and it's
why there's an Endicott Road

05:32.752 --> 05:35.102
that passes through some of the
most desirable neighbourhoods

05:35.145 --> 05:36.712
- in Middleton.
- You must be

05:36.756 --> 05:39.323
- very proud of your heritage.
- Oh, well, all the Endicotts

05:39.367 --> 05:41.238
were interesting in their own right.

05:41.282 --> 05:42.805
Douglas's wife Doris was

05:42.849 --> 05:44.894
a formidable lady
who apparently used to play

05:44.938 --> 05:47.706
a mean game of seven-card stud,

05:48.289 --> 05:50.813
which also happens to be one
of my own hidden passions,

05:50.857 --> 05:53.076
but don't tell anyone that
your Mayor occasionally likes

05:53.120 --> 05:56.123
to hold out until the river to
see if she hits her straight.

05:56.166 --> 05:58.125
- Your secret's safe.
- JARED!

05:59.430 --> 06:01.215
- Yes, Madam Mayor?
- I want you

06:01.258 --> 06:03.957
to give Grace unlimited access
to the archives room, so she can

06:04.000 --> 06:06.612
research any history she needs
to learn for the website.

06:06.655 --> 06:08.178
- Yes, ma'am.
- And also, she'll need

06:08.222 --> 06:10.790
the password into
the city account, so she can

06:10.833 --> 06:13.619
- go onto our computers.
- It's password.

06:13.662 --> 06:15.316
The city's password

06:15.359 --> 06:17.057
- is "password"?
- Yeah, the mayor wanted it

06:17.100 --> 06:18.904
to be something
that was easy to remember.

06:20.800 --> 06:22.802
Mm-hmm.

06:22.845 --> 06:24.673
Everybody says that here
in the town square is where

06:24.717 --> 06:26.980
the most exciting things
in Middleton happen.

06:27.023 --> 06:29.330
We have the Lights Festival in December,

06:29.373 --> 06:31.071
and we had a book release party

06:31.114 --> 06:33.943
for the third book in the
Terrenceville series too.

06:33.987 --> 06:35.510
The Enchantress Unites.

06:35.553 --> 06:37.730
- You've read that?
- My niece

06:37.773 --> 06:40.515
made me read her a couple
of chapters and then I needed

06:40.558 --> 06:41.734
something to read on the plane.

06:41.777 --> 06:43.257
Oh, so it wasn't the romance

06:43.300 --> 06:45.389
- that sucked you in.
- I just always have to know

06:45.433 --> 06:46.782
where a story's going.

06:49.002 --> 06:50.873
I really do love it here.

06:50.917 --> 06:52.309
Yeah, it's a place to live.

06:54.181 --> 06:56.531
What made you end up in Middleton?

06:56.574 --> 06:58.794
I just wanted to get away from New York.

06:58.838 --> 07:01.188
Oh. Was that after your friends

07:01.231 --> 07:03.103
who weren't really your
friends stole your ad company

07:03.146 --> 07:05.583
- out from under you?
- How do you know about that?

07:06.846 --> 07:08.935
I found some stuff online.

07:08.978 --> 07:11.198
I didn't realize there was
anything about that on there.

07:11.241 --> 07:12.982
Yeah, I had to dig through
a few filters, but...

07:14.331 --> 07:16.290
I can't imagine
all the embarrassing stuff

07:16.333 --> 07:18.727
- you probably found!
- No!

07:18.771 --> 07:21.425
What I found was a person who's
honest and free and tells people

07:21.469 --> 07:23.176
exactly what she thinks...

07:23.558 --> 07:26.256
and has worn the same Christmas sweater

07:26.300 --> 07:27.388
for like, three years.

07:28.606 --> 07:30.260
Yeah, I need a new one.

07:30.304 --> 07:31.871
I thought it looked nice.

07:33.524 --> 07:37.050
I should probably admit
I looked you up too.

07:37.093 --> 07:39.226
But the best thing about
being a computer programmer

07:39.269 --> 07:41.054
is I know how to hide all
the most embarrassing things.

07:41.097 --> 07:42.882
Oh. So when do I get to find out

07:42.925 --> 07:44.823
the stuff you don't want me to know?

07:45.536 --> 07:48.539
I guess you'll have to
learn to get past my filter.

07:48.583 --> 07:49.995
I'll keep working on that.

07:54.458 --> 07:55.808
How are you feeling?

07:55.851 --> 07:58.114
Well, I'm still sore, but it's...

07:58.158 --> 08:00.421
- starting to get better.
- OK.

08:00.464 --> 08:02.379
No, no. Shouldn't you be off your feet?

08:02.423 --> 08:03.946
I know that's what a doctor would say.

08:03.990 --> 08:07.036
Doctors tend to be
a little bit too cautious

08:07.080 --> 08:08.734
- about these things.
- Well, some of them actually

08:08.777 --> 08:10.953
know what they're talking about.

08:10.997 --> 08:12.520
- Hey, Nick.
- Hey.

08:12.563 --> 08:15.175
The soup is mostly for your
dad, but help yourself too.

08:15.218 --> 08:16.460
- Thanks.
- How are those college

08:16.485 --> 08:19.074
- applications coming?
- I haven't started filling them

08:19.099 --> 08:21.623
- out yet.
- The deadline is three days

08:21.648 --> 08:23.911
- from now.
- So I still have three days.

08:25.446 --> 08:26.969
All right. Let's get you

08:27.013 --> 08:29.537
on the couch, get some rest.
I brought you a heating pad.

08:29.580 --> 08:31.452
Oh, we've got one of those, but thanks.

08:31.477 --> 08:34.524
Yeah, but it's broken. It
doesn't go past barely warm.

08:35.804 --> 08:37.284
Well, I guess I can use it.

08:37.327 --> 08:38.981
Well, I'll be in my room.

08:39.025 --> 08:42.592
- Working on those college apps.
- Eventually.

08:44.726 --> 08:46.815
I can never find this outlet.

08:46.859 --> 08:48.425
Here, you want some more light?

08:49.818 --> 08:50.906
I got it.

08:50.950 --> 08:52.908
Here we go.

08:52.952 --> 08:55.041
All right. Can I get you anything else?

08:55.084 --> 08:57.739
I've got heat, I've got soup,
everything a man can want.

08:57.783 --> 08:59.697
Yeah. Well then, my work is done.

09:02.048 --> 09:03.527
Hey, um...

09:03.571 --> 09:05.703
I was thinking about what you
said at the hospital.

09:05.747 --> 09:07.140
What'd I say?

09:07.183 --> 09:08.837
It was about how,

09:08.881 --> 09:10.796
with our wedding coming up,
maybe I shouldn't

09:10.839 --> 09:13.494
be climbing around on a friend's roof.

09:13.537 --> 09:15.539
Well, you know, I wanted our first dance

09:15.583 --> 09:17.411
to be an actual dance.

09:17.454 --> 09:19.892
That was the first time
you've brought up the wedding

09:19.935 --> 09:22.111
in I don't know how long.

09:23.852 --> 09:25.071
Was it?

09:25.114 --> 09:26.550
Been a while, yeah.

09:28.248 --> 09:31.817
And all we've decided on is
what song we want to be played.

09:31.860 --> 09:34.036
What about everything else?
Have you walked past that place

09:34.080 --> 09:36.604
on the beach where you want
the wedding to happen? Or...

09:36.647 --> 09:39.650
seen that perfect colour of
flower you were hoping to find?

09:39.694 --> 09:40.956
Not really, no.

09:42.610 --> 09:45.004
You're not having
second thoughts, are you?

09:45.047 --> 09:47.267
Sam, of course not.

09:47.310 --> 09:49.225
'cause... I'm good to go.

09:49.269 --> 09:50.444
I'm all set.

09:53.273 --> 09:55.405
So just let me know when you are. OK?

10:05.285 --> 10:06.852
Where would the original photo be?

10:06.895 --> 10:10.333
Somewhere in here.
They're sorted by date.

10:10.377 --> 10:11.900
Oh. Well, the fire took place

10:11.944 --> 10:15.077
on April 12th, 1922.

10:15.121 --> 10:17.297
19...

10:17.340 --> 10:19.212
20... 2.

10:19.255 --> 10:20.866
It's the photo on the website.

10:20.909 --> 10:22.563
It's of Douglas Endicott
receiving his award

10:22.606 --> 10:24.043
for saving that family.

10:25.783 --> 10:27.829
The one where he's getting
the ribbon, sure.

10:27.873 --> 10:30.440
Let's see, let's see. April. Here we go.

10:32.616 --> 10:33.879
All right.

10:35.184 --> 10:36.446
Thanks.

10:37.795 --> 10:38.927
Oh!

10:38.971 --> 10:40.320
Yeah, that's the one.

10:42.844 --> 10:43.960
Wait...

10:44.672 --> 10:46.152
the photo on the website

10:46.195 --> 10:47.980
cropped out everyone else who was there.

10:48.023 --> 10:51.418
- Hmm.
- He does look heroic.

10:51.461 --> 10:54.073
And his wife, she looks so proud.

10:54.116 --> 10:55.988
It looks like there are
actually a few more of him

10:56.031 --> 10:58.599
- from that same year.
- Oh, well maybe I can use them

10:58.642 --> 11:00.253
- on the website too.
- Yeah.

11:03.473 --> 11:06.607
- Is that Douglas Endicott?
- It looks like it.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.959
"Opening day, Chicago, 1922."

11:11.003 --> 11:12.830
Can I take that?

11:12.874 --> 11:15.616
- Yeah, take whatever you want.
- And if you ever need to get

11:15.659 --> 11:18.662
back in here, you come on down.
That door is always unlocked.

11:18.706 --> 11:21.056
Shouldn't you keep stuff like this

11:21.100 --> 11:23.580
- more secure?
- Well, yeah. We used to,

11:23.624 --> 11:25.843
but the mayor kept
losing her key, and I got

11:25.887 --> 11:27.671
a little tired of hearing, "Jared!"

11:27.715 --> 11:29.630
- So...
- I understand.

11:29.673 --> 11:32.459
- Mm-hmm.
- Here you are.

11:32.502 --> 11:33.843
Have a nice day.

11:34.504 --> 11:36.724
So, where have they set up camp?

11:36.767 --> 11:37.943
Are there serious injuries?

11:39.335 --> 11:42.077
Um... yeah, let me see
if I can get there.

11:42.121 --> 11:45.428
I'll let you know. Eve, will you
get in touch with Dr. Legett

11:45.472 --> 11:46.995
and see if he can cover me
for the next few days?

11:47.039 --> 11:49.171
- Is everything OK?
- Yeah, not really.

11:49.215 --> 11:51.347
You know I did some work
with that aid organization

11:51.391 --> 11:52.816
- last summer?
- In South America.

11:52.859 --> 11:54.960
Right. They've had a series of
storms near one of the villages

11:55.003 --> 11:57.788
I visited before. And they
really need medical personnel

11:57.832 --> 12:00.386
down there to help with
the evacuation sites.

12:00.411 --> 12:01.879
When do they need you?

12:01.923 --> 12:03.533
As soon as possible. I'm
gonna see how quickly I can

12:03.577 --> 12:05.144
- get a flight.
- I'll get in touch

12:05.187 --> 12:07.885
- with Dr. Legett.
- I need to tell Cassie.

12:17.504 --> 12:19.288
- Hello, Eve!
- Hello!

12:23.423 --> 12:24.641
Do you think

12:24.685 --> 12:26.687
- that Sam would like this?
- He would.

12:26.730 --> 12:28.689
I am putting together
a few things for him to take

12:28.732 --> 12:30.778
to Columbia. Also, I got him this.

12:32.040 --> 12:33.650
It's a pen light.

12:33.694 --> 12:36.001
- What can I help you find?
- A wedding gift.

12:36.044 --> 12:39.221
Not for you. It's for my friend Karen.
Although, I am

12:39.265 --> 12:42.311
to know when you and Dr. Radford
are going to set a date.

12:42.355 --> 12:44.705
We'll be setting a date very soon.

12:46.837 --> 12:49.057
Are you worried
about Dr. Radford being gone?

12:49.101 --> 12:50.841
Oh, no. He's been there before. I'm sure

12:50.885 --> 12:53.018
- he'll be fine.
- It's just with the storms

12:53.061 --> 12:55.890
- going on...
- Storms?

12:55.933 --> 12:58.806
That's why he needs
to get there so quickly.

12:58.849 --> 13:01.722
- Oh. He didn't mention that to me.
- He just said he was going.

13:01.765 --> 13:03.550
Oh. Well, I'm sure it's nothing

13:03.593 --> 13:06.770
- to be too concerned about.
- Yeah, probably.

13:09.295 --> 13:11.819
- Mayor Tinsdale?
- Oh, Grace! Hello.

13:11.862 --> 13:13.473
I need to talk to you about the website.

13:13.516 --> 13:15.518
- Oh, then I'm glad you caught me.
- Have you found a way

13:15.562 --> 13:17.694
to feature my family
even more prominently?

13:17.738 --> 13:20.349
- I found something.
- I found this photo

13:20.393 --> 13:23.091
of Douglas Endicott in the
archives getting his award.

13:23.135 --> 13:24.875
- Oh!
- And this one of him

13:24.919 --> 13:27.139
- at a Cubs game.
- My great-grandfather was

13:27.182 --> 13:29.445
a Cubs fan, so I guess
it runs in the family.

13:29.489 --> 13:31.099
That was on opening day,

13:31.143 --> 13:33.319
April 12, 1922.

13:33.362 --> 13:35.582
- So?
- So that was the same day

13:35.625 --> 13:37.540
that he was supposed to have
been saving that family

13:37.584 --> 13:39.890
- from the burning building.
- Well...

13:39.934 --> 13:41.805
that's impossible! How could he have

13:41.849 --> 13:44.547
been in Middleton and Chicago
at the same time?

13:44.591 --> 13:46.027
He couldn't have been...

13:46.071 --> 13:47.985
and he definitely wasn't here.

13:48.029 --> 13:49.854
That photo proves it.

13:50.336 --> 13:54.557
Well... then that would mean
that the legend isn't true.

13:54.601 --> 13:56.081
There's no way it could be.

13:58.039 --> 14:00.346
Then my family name is a...

14:00.389 --> 14:01.608
a fraud.

14:05.481 --> 14:06.569
Oh...

14:07.875 --> 14:09.927
Why didn't you tell me about the storms?

14:09.971 --> 14:11.748
Didn't I?

14:11.792 --> 14:13.315
I didn't mean not to.

14:13.359 --> 14:14.648
I guess I was just thinking
about everything I had to do

14:14.692 --> 14:17.189
about my flights and make sure
all my patients were covered.

14:17.232 --> 14:19.800
Right. And when are you getting there?

14:19.843 --> 14:22.324
Well, if I can make the
connection in Bogota, I should

14:22.368 --> 14:25.284
get to the evacuation centre
not too late in the morning.

14:25.327 --> 14:27.100
I'll be back in a few days.

14:27.764 --> 14:29.686
I got you a couple
of things before you go.

14:32.856 --> 14:34.684
Ah.

14:34.728 --> 14:36.773
To keep you warm
if the winds get too strong.

14:38.819 --> 14:40.255
- I love it.
- And...

14:40.299 --> 14:42.257
in case you need to plug
something in in the dark...

14:43.693 --> 14:45.130
- It's a pen light.
- Ah!

14:46.609 --> 14:48.176
Thanks.

14:48.220 --> 14:49.830
You sure you don't want me
to take you to the airport?

14:49.873 --> 14:52.528
Nick said he wanted to,
and he promised he's gonna

14:52.572 --> 14:54.182
work on those college
applications while I'm gone.

14:54.226 --> 14:56.793
OK. Well, I'll make sure he
gets done what he needs to.

14:59.535 --> 15:01.798
- Call me when you get there.
- Yeah, I'll try.

15:01.842 --> 15:04.018
That cell service is really
spotty in the mountains.

15:04.061 --> 15:05.759
OK. Just know I'm thinking of you.

15:07.195 --> 15:08.544
I'm thinking about you too.

15:10.067 --> 15:11.156
I love you.

15:12.461 --> 15:13.984
Yeah. I love you.

15:23.037 --> 15:24.343
I have to...

15:24.386 --> 15:26.171
- Yeah. Go.
- OK.

15:51.326 --> 15:53.154
- Dr. Radford.
- Yeah.

15:53.198 --> 15:55.112
Shannon Calderon, physician in charge.

15:55.156 --> 15:56.810
- Ah, nice to meet you.
- Thank you so much for coming

15:56.853 --> 15:59.987
- here so quickly.
- Oh, sure. No problem.

16:00.030 --> 16:01.423
- How's it going inside?
- It's all right.

16:01.467 --> 16:04.034
We got about a couple hundred
people in here.

16:04.078 --> 16:05.949
Some of them are injured and
they're in the medical tent,

16:05.993 --> 16:07.386
which is where we're
gonna need you, of course.

16:07.429 --> 16:09.953
All right. Is this wind
supposed to get any worse?

16:09.997 --> 16:11.346
Well, I hope not.

16:14.306 --> 16:16.786
- Do you speak Spanish?
- Ah... un poco.

16:16.830 --> 16:18.788
Well, you should be able to get by.

16:18.832 --> 16:21.530
Here. So, we have plenty of food,

16:21.574 --> 16:23.271
but not very much drinking water.

16:23.315 --> 16:25.099
- Thanks.
- And...

16:26.361 --> 16:28.276
our generator is just strong enough

16:28.320 --> 16:29.712
to barely keep the lights on.

16:31.061 --> 16:32.411
This is your first patient here.

16:32.454 --> 16:34.804
This gentleman fractured his wrist

16:34.848 --> 16:37.285
when he was trying to get
his car out of the mud.

16:40.245 --> 16:41.942
If you need anything, I'm in
that tent there. Good luck.

16:41.985 --> 16:43.639
OK. Thank you. Sure.

16:48.126 --> 16:50.126
_

16:55.042 --> 16:56.478
Ah...

17:08.534 --> 17:10.884
Hola. I'm a doctor.

17:10.926 --> 17:12.364
Soy medico.

17:20.633 --> 17:22.503
Thanks for letting me
come over for breakfast.

17:22.548 --> 17:24.463
You are welcome here
any time your dad is gone,

17:24.506 --> 17:26.073
and even when he's here.

17:27.428 --> 17:28.951
Where are you headed off to?

17:29.076 --> 17:31.513
Phil wanted me to show him
more of Middleton.

17:31.557 --> 17:33.776
You sure all those tours
aren't just an excuse

17:33.820 --> 17:36.431
- for him to be with you?
- Of course they are.

17:36.475 --> 17:38.564
Why do you think I keep saying yes?

17:38.607 --> 17:40.870
Taken him to the old mill yet?

17:40.914 --> 17:42.437
I hadn't thought of that.

17:42.481 --> 17:45.266
It's such a part of Middleton's history,

17:45.310 --> 17:47.573
and I'm pretty sure it snowed
out there last night,

17:47.616 --> 17:50.706
so you might wanna see
how beautiful things look.

17:50.750 --> 17:52.317
- That's a good idea.
- Mm-hmm.

17:54.319 --> 17:55.929
- Morning!
- Hello.

17:55.972 --> 17:59.149
- Hey. Oh, did I miss breakfast?
- Oh, you can grab anything

17:59.193 --> 18:00.586
before Nick puts it away.

18:00.629 --> 18:02.857
- Help yourself.
- Thanks.

18:04.067 --> 18:07.375
So, have you made any progress
on the website for the mayor?

18:07.419 --> 18:10.160
I made some progress,
but not the kind she likes.

18:10.204 --> 18:11.640
- Oh.
- I found out

18:11.684 --> 18:14.077
that Mayor Tinsdale's
great-grandfather didn't save

18:14.121 --> 18:16.689
the family like everyone thought
he did, because he wasn't

18:16.732 --> 18:19.387
- even there when it happened.
- Hmm.

18:19.431 --> 18:22.738
At the corner of Endicott
Road and Shanaman Avenue.

18:22.782 --> 18:24.784
- Where's that?
- Well, there's a park

18:24.827 --> 18:26.829
there now, but it's
where the hotel used to be.

18:26.873 --> 18:29.745
They named the streets
after Douglas Endicott and...

18:29.789 --> 18:31.573
somebody Shanaman.

18:31.617 --> 18:34.054
I can show you where it was, if...

18:35.925 --> 18:39.842
Oh, yeah. I thought I still
had one of those in here.

18:39.886 --> 18:41.409
What am I supposed to do with this?

18:41.453 --> 18:42.541
It's a map.

18:42.584 --> 18:44.847
You use it to find your way to places.

18:44.891 --> 18:46.719
I thought that's what phones were for.

18:46.762 --> 18:48.547
Yeah, except this one
folds, and you can put it

18:48.590 --> 18:50.766
- in your glove box.
- Then how come there are never

18:50.810 --> 18:53.247
- any gloves in there?
- Will you just take it?

18:53.290 --> 18:56.206
- See where it leads you.
- Do you need help

18:56.250 --> 18:58.644
- with the dishes?
- Already taken care of.

19:00.254 --> 19:01.473
Huh.

19:01.516 --> 19:03.170
- Wish me luck.
- OK.

19:04.867 --> 19:06.695
Any word from Dad?

19:06.739 --> 19:08.697
- Not yet.
- Well, I'm sure he'll call

19:08.741 --> 19:10.482
when he can.

19:10.525 --> 19:11.831
Yeah.

19:15.225 --> 19:18.620
So, you had a chance to work
on those college applications?

19:18.664 --> 19:20.187
Well, I really want to,

19:20.230 --> 19:22.450
but we have all these dishes, so...

19:22.494 --> 19:25.018
- Uh-huh.
- Plus, I'm...

19:25.061 --> 19:26.976
not sure where I should apply.

19:27.020 --> 19:28.674
All my friends seem to be excited

19:28.717 --> 19:30.589
about where they're gonna be,

19:30.632 --> 19:32.591
but I have no idea.

19:32.634 --> 19:34.680
I haven't even figured out
what I wanna do.

19:34.723 --> 19:36.203
You don't have to have your entire

19:36.246 --> 19:38.379
- future planned out right now.
- Yeah.

19:38.423 --> 19:40.686
Tell that to... everybody.

19:42.209 --> 19:43.340
Hey, why don't you have dinner

19:43.384 --> 19:45.125
with me and Grace at The Bistro tonight?

19:45.168 --> 19:47.301
You can work on those applications

19:47.344 --> 19:49.129
while you have
whatever dessert it'll take

19:49.172 --> 19:51.436
to bribe you to work
on those applications.

19:52.567 --> 19:53.873
Well, they do have

19:53.916 --> 19:55.527
my favourite apple pie.

19:55.570 --> 19:57.703
See? You have that part
of your future planned.

20:22.554 --> 20:24.033
You're gonna wanna keep this tight. OK?

20:24.077 --> 20:26.296
Tight. You understand?

20:26.340 --> 20:27.689
It's gonna be OK.

20:30.866 --> 20:32.651
- Excuse me, Doctor?
- Yeah.

20:32.694 --> 20:35.088
- My sister has been crying all day.
- Can you find out what's wrong?

20:35.131 --> 20:37.177
- Sure, I can take a look.
- Her name is Isabelle.

20:37.220 --> 20:39.832
- Isabelle. What's your name?
- Rosa.

20:39.875 --> 20:41.921
Rosa. Won't you take a seat right here

20:41.964 --> 20:43.705
and let's see what's making

20:43.749 --> 20:45.402
little Isabelle so cranky.

20:50.320 --> 20:52.409
It's OK. Shh. Shh. It's all right.

20:54.455 --> 20:55.674
Ah...

20:55.717 --> 20:57.698
Oh. Ah...

21:01.419 --> 21:02.985
Oh, there you go.

21:06.859 --> 21:08.730
Ah... I need more light.

21:10.832 --> 21:12.181
Ah!

21:15.432 --> 21:16.912
This'll give me a better look.

21:22.657 --> 21:24.616
- Ah... Yeah.
- Isabelle.

21:28.184 --> 21:29.621
- Isabelle.
- There you go.

21:29.664 --> 21:31.231
That's not supposed to be there.

21:34.887 --> 21:37.846
A little piece of wood against
her tympanic membrane.

21:40.066 --> 21:42.634
Eardrum. Which would make me cranky too.

21:42.677 --> 21:44.374
- Yeah.
- Thank you so much.

21:44.418 --> 21:47.464
De nada.

21:54.515 --> 21:56.909
- Gracias.
- Gracias. Gracias.

22:01.391 --> 22:04.133
It says I'm supposed to be...

22:04.177 --> 22:06.571
I don't know how anybody ever
read one of these things.

22:08.736 --> 22:10.129
Oh!

22:10.154 --> 22:11.547
There I am.

22:16.668 --> 22:18.626
- Mayor Tinsdale?
- Oh.

22:18.670 --> 22:20.585
- Grace.
- What are you doing here?

22:20.628 --> 22:23.022
Just basking in the false memories

22:23.065 --> 22:25.633
of my ancestral glory. I thought I'd take

22:25.677 --> 22:27.766
some pictures of the street
sign before they consign it

22:27.809 --> 22:30.769
and my family name
to the dustbin of history.

22:30.812 --> 22:33.946
Wait. On the map, it says it's
supposed to be Shanaman Avenue,

22:33.989 --> 22:36.644
but the sign says "Norman Way."
Yes, I think they

22:36.688 --> 22:39.255
- changed that some years ago.
- Why would they do that?

22:39.299 --> 22:41.475
I don't know. I just sign the requests.

22:43.651 --> 22:45.479
Is that where the hotel used to be?

22:46.872 --> 22:48.090
Yes.

22:48.134 --> 22:50.049
The hub of activity in those days.

22:50.092 --> 22:53.705
Hmm. I wonder what else
might've been going on there.

22:53.748 --> 22:55.358
Sadly, the answer involves

22:55.402 --> 22:57.534
no glory for the Endicotts.

22:59.580 --> 23:00.712
Maybe.

23:01.843 --> 23:04.150
- I'll see you later.
- Mm.

23:04.193 --> 23:05.673
Ta-ta.

23:07.936 --> 23:09.808
Cassie said there'd be snow
out here, but I didn't know

23:09.851 --> 23:13.115
- there would be this much.
- Well, it was worth the trip.

23:13.159 --> 23:15.074
What'd they used to do here?

23:15.117 --> 23:17.293
I guess they milled stuff?

23:18.643 --> 23:20.340
Yeah, this'd be the place to do that.

23:21.602 --> 23:23.909
Just let me know if you see any ghosts.

23:23.952 --> 23:26.433
A lot of people think
this place is haunted.

23:26.476 --> 23:28.870
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

23:28.914 --> 23:32.526
Apparently, there was this
woman whose husband left her,

23:32.569 --> 23:34.354
and she had no place to live,

23:34.397 --> 23:36.312
so she moved in here.

23:36.356 --> 23:38.837
And every night, she would
lie down next to the furnace,

23:38.880 --> 23:40.926
hoping he would return.

23:40.969 --> 23:42.231
But he never did.

23:43.624 --> 23:46.235
She died of a broken heart,

23:46.260 --> 23:49.089
and she's haunted this place ever since.

23:49.151 --> 23:50.457
Do all stories about Middleton

23:50.482 --> 23:52.702
have something to do
with mystery or romance?

23:52.764 --> 23:54.591
Not all of them.

23:54.635 --> 23:56.202
Some of them are about magic.

24:01.207 --> 24:02.633
Are there any stories about...

24:03.557 --> 24:04.732
a man and a woman

24:04.776 --> 24:08.083
walking on a bridge, and then he just...

24:08.127 --> 24:10.651
kind of... kissed her?

24:12.697 --> 24:14.220
I don't think so...

24:15.961 --> 24:17.440
but maybe there should be.

24:26.754 --> 24:28.451
Did I tell you that I love it here?

24:30.236 --> 24:31.803
Yeah, it's pretty nice.

24:54.739 --> 24:56.436
What colleges are you applying to?

24:56.479 --> 24:58.090
Well, so far, none of them.

24:58.133 --> 25:00.745
But he's gonna fill out some
applications during dessert.

25:00.788 --> 25:03.922
So I might as well finish this slowly.

25:03.965 --> 25:06.272
I am so sorry for the
confusion, Mrs. Hannah,

25:06.315 --> 25:08.535
but there's really nothing I can do.

25:08.578 --> 25:10.145
I'm sorry.

25:11.930 --> 25:13.366
Oh! I will take those.

25:13.409 --> 25:15.629
You go clear and set up table six. OK?

25:17.239 --> 25:18.763
Ooh, it's a busy night.

25:18.806 --> 25:21.026
Ugh! Well, I could use an extra arm.

25:21.069 --> 25:23.768
And a delivery person. Poor Mrs. Hannah

25:23.811 --> 25:25.465
ordered food to go and thought

25:25.508 --> 25:26.945
that that meant for delivery.

25:27.989 --> 25:29.034
I'd take it to her myself

25:29.077 --> 25:31.384
if I wasn't so swamped, but...

25:31.427 --> 25:32.994
clearly, I can't do that.

25:34.343 --> 25:35.562
I can take it.

25:36.596 --> 25:39.087
Really? That would be great.

25:39.131 --> 25:40.959
Oh, but I thought
you were gonna be working

25:41.002 --> 25:45.224
- on those college apps.
- And this way, I don't have to.

25:45.267 --> 25:47.835
Well, it is already
boxed up and ready to go.

25:49.184 --> 25:51.708
You know what? I need
to get down to City Hall.

25:51.752 --> 25:53.232
Jared said that he would
go get some stuff for me

25:53.275 --> 25:55.582
out of the basement, and he gets scared

25:55.625 --> 25:56.888
when he's down there by himself.

25:57.976 --> 25:59.238
- Bye.
- Bye.

26:02.632 --> 26:05.897
- Hi!
- What's going on?

26:05.940 --> 26:07.594
- What?
- You look happy.

26:08.769 --> 26:10.118
Am I not normally?

26:10.143 --> 26:13.389
There's just something
different with your face.

26:14.166 --> 26:15.602
Huh...

26:19.911 --> 26:22.348
- Cassie?
- Oh, hi.

26:23.784 --> 26:25.133
Is everything all right?

26:25.177 --> 26:27.987
- Yeah, I'm good.
- No, you're not.

26:29.094 --> 26:31.705
I can't help but wonder how Sam is doing.

26:32.793 --> 26:34.360
You haven't heard from him.

26:34.403 --> 26:36.362
No, and I wasn't sure I would, but...

26:37.580 --> 26:39.147
ever since I said goodbye, I've

26:39.191 --> 26:41.541
had this weird feeling that I
haven't had in a long time.

26:43.238 --> 26:44.674
You know...

26:44.718 --> 26:45.980
it's the same thing I felt

26:46.024 --> 26:48.809
every time Jake would leave,

26:48.853 --> 26:51.159
when he'd put on his uniform
and walk out the door...

26:52.944 --> 26:55.207
...not knowing for sure
if he was ever coming back.

26:57.122 --> 26:58.688
That must've been really hard.

26:58.732 --> 27:00.690
Yeah, it was.

27:02.736 --> 27:04.346
It is.

27:05.870 --> 27:08.829
You know, I keep checking
the news where Sam is, but...

27:08.873 --> 27:11.223
there's hardly any news at all.

27:15.096 --> 27:16.358
It's gonna take this bone

27:16.402 --> 27:18.099
a long time to set.
Can we get him in a cast?

27:18.143 --> 27:19.840
Yeah, as soon as we get some
more supplies, but right now,

27:19.884 --> 27:21.146
we're out of pretty much everything.

27:23.496 --> 27:25.585
Does he understand he's
gonna be in a lot of pain?

27:25.628 --> 27:26.934
Yeah, I'm gonna try to explain.

27:26.978 --> 27:28.109
All right.

27:30.851 --> 27:34.159
Rosa, how long has your
father's arm been hurting?

27:34.202 --> 27:35.769
- What do you mean?
- Well, he's been favouring

27:35.812 --> 27:37.031
that left arm all day.

27:42.994 --> 27:44.996
He said it's been hurting all day.

27:45.039 --> 27:46.693
He never tells us how he really feels.

27:47.999 --> 27:49.957
May I? Esta bien?

27:50.001 --> 27:51.393
Si.

27:53.004 --> 27:54.919
Does it hurt when I do this?

27:54.962 --> 27:56.485
- Aie!
- Yeah, the area's tender.

27:56.529 --> 27:58.661
It's probably sprained. We
need to get him in a sling,

27:58.705 --> 28:00.794
and I just used the last one.

28:00.837 --> 28:03.579
Ah! I have that scarf Cassie gave me.

28:07.975 --> 28:10.756
OK. Tell your father...

28:11.413 --> 28:13.154
he's gonna need to stay
in this for a few days.

28:13.198 --> 28:16.549
OK? Here you go.
Put your arm through here.

28:16.592 --> 28:18.377
- Si.
- And tell him he needs to let

28:18.420 --> 28:20.031
you know when he's not feeling well.

28:20.074 --> 28:22.381
Let the people that care
about you care about you.

28:23.512 --> 28:25.950
- Gracias, doctor.
- Thank you.

28:28.691 --> 28:30.432
- Doctor Radford?
- Yeah?

28:30.476 --> 28:32.869
- We got trucks moving in here.
- We've been ordered to evacuate.

28:32.913 --> 28:35.437
- All right. So what's wrong?
- The storm has changed course

28:35.481 --> 28:37.526
and it's threatening our
site, so we need to move

28:37.570 --> 28:39.398
to a safer location
about 80 miles from here.

28:39.441 --> 28:41.182
- OK?
- OK.

28:41.226 --> 28:44.533
- Por favor, atencion!
- OK. No rush.

28:44.577 --> 28:47.362
No rush. Can you walk? OK.

28:50.975 --> 28:52.628
I went to where it happened,

28:52.672 --> 28:54.979
and I just... I had this feeling

28:55.022 --> 28:56.806
that maybe something else

28:56.850 --> 28:58.373
was going on there.

29:00.375 --> 29:02.290
Wait, what's all that?

29:02.334 --> 29:04.771
Oh, I don't know. I keep on thinking

29:04.814 --> 29:07.730
I'll have time to catalogue
all this stuff, but frankly,

29:07.774 --> 29:09.863
I'd need an assistant
of my own to do that.

29:14.781 --> 29:15.869
What's in this?

29:18.350 --> 29:21.266
Oh. "Items recovered
from Richard Shanaman's

29:21.309 --> 29:23.398
illegal poker game."

29:23.442 --> 29:24.965
Richard Shanaman?

29:25.009 --> 29:27.315
They named a street after him,
but then they changed it.

29:27.359 --> 29:29.883
- Why would they do that?
- Because he was running

29:29.926 --> 29:32.146
an illegal poker game?

29:32.190 --> 29:34.148
Does it say on there
when all this was recovered?

29:34.192 --> 29:37.847
Uh... "April 12, 1922."

29:39.414 --> 29:40.763
The hotel fire.

29:50.382 --> 29:51.774
Well, this is weird.

29:52.819 --> 29:53.994
Why?

29:55.126 --> 29:56.301
In those days,

29:56.344 --> 29:57.954
poker was a man's game.

29:57.998 --> 29:59.826
Any woman who would have been
there would've been looked at

29:59.869 --> 30:02.307
as being... of ill repute.

30:03.830 --> 30:05.353
There's something in here.

30:07.138 --> 30:08.617
What does it say?

30:10.837 --> 30:12.360
Who the purse belonged to.

30:15.668 --> 30:16.930
And now I understand

30:16.973 --> 30:19.019
why she couldn't say she was there.

30:27.071 --> 30:29.943
- Who is it?
- Delivery from The Bistro.

30:29.986 --> 30:32.728
Oh! Thank you.

30:32.772 --> 30:36.080
I'm sorry, I just can't
see anything out here.

30:36.123 --> 30:37.559
You know, that light's

30:37.603 --> 30:40.345
been out for a week. I tried
getting up on the ladder,

30:40.388 --> 30:42.782
but it's too wobbly for me.

30:42.825 --> 30:45.263
I can do that if you have a lightbulb.

30:45.306 --> 30:47.047
I have one right here.

30:50.572 --> 30:51.834
Here you go.

30:52.966 --> 30:54.054
Thanks.

30:57.188 --> 30:58.276
So...

30:58.319 --> 30:59.973
how many delivery guys

31:00.016 --> 31:02.323
does it take to change a lightbulb?

31:05.631 --> 31:06.675
One.

31:08.416 --> 31:10.592
One very helpful one.

31:12.159 --> 31:15.075
Oh, thank you so much!

31:15.119 --> 31:17.033
Now, what do I owe you?

31:17.077 --> 31:19.775
Oh, maintenance is free
with every delivery.

31:19.819 --> 31:21.386
Well, now, here. You...

31:23.083 --> 31:27.174
You have one of these.
I just made the batch.

31:27.218 --> 31:28.697
- Thank you.
- I was about to take

31:28.741 --> 31:30.656
them down to the homeless
shelter, but I can always

31:30.699 --> 31:33.963
make some more. Well, you know,

31:34.007 --> 31:36.140
I've never asked you your name.

31:36.183 --> 31:38.838
- Nick Radford.
- Like Dr. Radford?

31:38.881 --> 31:40.535
Yeah. That's my dad.

31:40.579 --> 31:42.494
Oh, and are you going
to be just like him?

31:42.537 --> 31:43.802
Are you going to be a doctor?

31:44.800 --> 31:46.179
Uh...

31:46.889 --> 31:49.057
I don't know what I wanna do.

32:05.473 --> 32:07.780
Any news about Sam?

32:07.823 --> 32:09.129
No.

32:10.609 --> 32:12.524
I just wanna know that he's OK.

32:13.829 --> 32:16.267
Oh, you usually have

32:16.310 --> 32:18.530
a good sense of how things
are gonna turn out.

32:18.573 --> 32:20.662
Yeah, most of the time, but...

32:22.708 --> 32:24.593
I'm sure he's gonna be all right.

32:25.580 --> 32:27.321
You know, I want...

32:27.365 --> 32:30.759
I wanted Sam to be safe,
so I even put sort of a...

32:30.803 --> 32:32.370
good luck charm in his pocket.

32:33.588 --> 32:35.721
Sam doesn't really believe in luck.

32:35.764 --> 32:37.462
That's why I didn't tell him I did it.

32:38.767 --> 32:41.109
I understand why you're
trying to protect him.

32:42.118 --> 32:44.599
You're looking at a lifetime together

32:44.643 --> 32:46.558
and you wanna make sure you do everything

32:46.601 --> 32:49.300
you can to make sure you don't lose him.

32:49.343 --> 32:51.828
- Well, Sam and I are in love.
- That's forever.

32:52.912 --> 32:54.653
Oh, no. I don't mean it like that.

32:54.696 --> 32:57.569
I mean... really lose him.

33:00.093 --> 33:01.137
Yeah.

33:01.181 --> 33:03.052
I shouldn't be feeling that way.

33:03.096 --> 33:04.793
But you are,

33:06.012 --> 33:08.536
because the last time you said the words

33:09.537 --> 33:11.147
'til death do us part,

33:13.106 --> 33:14.760
it happened a lot sooner than any of us

33:14.803 --> 33:16.240
thought it would.

33:17.710 --> 33:18.972
So you...

33:18.997 --> 33:21.347
you can't help but think
it might happen again.

33:23.334 --> 33:24.552
I keep falling in love

33:24.596 --> 33:27.030
with men who wanna change the world.

33:28.295 --> 33:30.950
Why do they have to take so many
risks while they're doing it?

33:32.386 --> 33:34.519
Because if they didn't...

33:34.562 --> 33:36.434
the world would never change.

33:49.098 --> 33:50.491
OK. Just lie here. OK? You'll be fine.

33:50.535 --> 33:52.014
You OK?

33:54.800 --> 33:56.236
- How are you doing?
- Hey. How many people

33:56.280 --> 33:57.933
- are left inside?
- I think there's just a few.

33:57.977 --> 34:00.066
OK. We need to get them all
in the truck now.

34:03.112 --> 34:04.940
Rosa! Your family has to

34:04.984 --> 34:07.334
- get on the truck.
- My mom says she needs help.

34:07.378 --> 34:09.467
She's been getting weaker all day.

34:09.510 --> 34:11.164
How long has it been since
she had anything to drink?

34:12.469 --> 34:13.667
Not since we got here.

34:13.710 --> 34:15.342
They said they were running low
on supplies and she was giving

34:15.386 --> 34:17.213
- all of it to the baby.
- She's dehydrated.

34:17.257 --> 34:20.739
- Help me get her up.
- OK. Mama. Mama. Mama.

34:20.782 --> 34:22.958
Sit up. There you go.

34:26.594 --> 34:27.768
- OK.
- Good.

34:27.793 --> 34:29.447
All right. OK. Come on.

34:33.795 --> 34:36.407
Tell your mother I can help her
once we get on the truck, OK?

34:36.449 --> 34:39.757
You good? Hey, is everything

34:39.801 --> 34:42.326
- OK here?
- Yeah. I need saline bags.

34:42.369 --> 34:43.804
- I got some more in the truck.
- Just one.

34:43.849 --> 34:45.110
- I'm on it.
- Yeah.

34:46.938 --> 34:48.462
- Here you go. I can help.
- Gracias.

34:48.505 --> 34:50.594
I got her. I got her.

34:50.638 --> 34:51.987
OK, Isabelle.

34:54.033 --> 34:55.687
Here you go!

34:55.730 --> 34:57.210
OK. Thanks.

35:02.041 --> 35:04.609
All right. I can get this
started once we get moving,

35:04.652 --> 35:06.045
all right? I just need
somewhere to hang this.

35:10.528 --> 35:11.746
This'll work.

35:17.317 --> 35:19.493
All right. Just put this
around your neck. OK?

35:20.712 --> 35:22.322
There you go.

35:22.366 --> 35:23.932
Once I get this drip started,
tell your mother

35:23.976 --> 35:25.978
she has to keep her arm below
the bag to get the fluid

35:26.021 --> 35:28.633
in her system. OK?

35:30.330 --> 35:31.984
OK.

35:32.027 --> 35:33.507
Isabelle wants to sit with you.

35:33.551 --> 35:34.943
Oh.

35:36.336 --> 35:37.859
OK.

35:37.903 --> 35:41.210
All right, Isabelle. It's gonna be fine.

35:41.254 --> 35:42.951
We're just going for a little ride.

36:03.972 --> 36:07.323
- Madam Mayor?
- Oh, Grace. Come on in.

36:07.367 --> 36:09.761
I found something out
about your ancestors.

36:09.804 --> 36:11.763
Well, I hope you're not
gonna put it on the website.

36:11.806 --> 36:13.504
I'm embarrassed enough as it is.

36:13.547 --> 36:16.245
No. This is good.

36:16.289 --> 36:17.856
I showed you this photo before

36:17.899 --> 36:20.815
- of Douglas getting his award.
- The one he didn't deserve.

36:20.859 --> 36:23.862
But look what Mrs. Endicott was holding.

36:23.905 --> 36:27.169
Those two children, the ones who
were carried out of the building.

36:27.213 --> 36:28.867
Well, I did mention she was formidable.

36:28.910 --> 36:31.260
And... she was a poker player.

36:31.304 --> 36:33.480
And do you know what was
going on in the basement

36:33.524 --> 36:35.439
of the building the night of the fire?

36:35.482 --> 36:38.006
A poker game. Jared and I found

36:38.050 --> 36:40.139
a box of items that were
recovered after the fact,

36:40.182 --> 36:42.620
and... this was in there.

36:42.663 --> 36:44.491
A lady's purse.

36:44.535 --> 36:46.406
And any woman who would've
been caught there would've been

36:46.450 --> 36:48.408
- too embarrassed to admit it.
- Well, yes.

36:48.452 --> 36:50.845
That was during prohibition,
so any such activities

36:50.889 --> 36:53.152
would have been frowned upon by everyone.

36:53.195 --> 36:55.937
Which is why Doris couldn't
admit that she was the one

36:55.981 --> 36:58.679
who saved the family,
but she left her purse there

36:58.723 --> 37:01.247
- while doing it.
- How do we know this was hers?

37:01.290 --> 37:03.510
Because I found something inside.

37:06.818 --> 37:09.385
"To Doris, love Douglas."

37:09.429 --> 37:11.387
They had to come up
with a different story

37:11.431 --> 37:13.781
in order to protect the family name,

37:13.825 --> 37:15.522
and Doris was smart enough to say

37:15.566 --> 37:17.481
that it was Douglas who was there.

37:17.524 --> 37:19.961
So an Endicott did save the day!

37:20.005 --> 37:22.311
Just not the Endicott people thought.

37:22.355 --> 37:24.618
So that means that the
street sign for Endicott Road

37:24.662 --> 37:26.402
can remain exactly where it is.

37:26.446 --> 37:29.362
I think it should,
to honour your family name.

37:29.405 --> 37:32.408
Well, you know,
we are very highly esteemed.

37:36.325 --> 37:37.805
Thank you for thinking of me.

37:37.849 --> 37:40.025
Oh, I know how much
you like lavender candles,

37:40.068 --> 37:42.680
and I wanted you to be the first
to know when they got here.

37:42.723 --> 37:44.899
- Come back any time.
- You know I will.

37:49.208 --> 37:50.731
Sam. Are you OK?

37:50.775 --> 37:52.733
I am, yeah. Everything's fine.

37:52.777 --> 37:54.779
We had to move to
a new location, but they had

37:54.822 --> 37:57.216
- a phone I could use.
- When are you coming home?

37:59.392 --> 38:01.916
Everybody here is safe,
but I'm glad I came to help.

38:01.960 --> 38:04.484
Yeah, I'm glad you did too.

38:04.528 --> 38:07.095
And... thanks for looking out for me.

38:08.401 --> 38:10.229
What did I do?

38:13.188 --> 38:14.842
I couldn't have done
what I did without you.

38:14.886 --> 38:17.628
- Dr. Radford?
- OK, I gotta go.

38:17.671 --> 38:20.152
- I'll see you tomorrow night.
- I'll be waiting up for you.

38:20.195 --> 38:23.416
- You don't have to do that.
- I'll do it anyway.

38:23.459 --> 38:25.244
- I love you.
- I love you too.

38:39.301 --> 38:41.477
- Hey, Cassie.
- Hi.

38:41.521 --> 38:44.524
- I just got a call from Dad.
- Yeah, he just called me too.

38:44.568 --> 38:46.880
It sounds like he's doing
a lot of good down there.

38:46.924 --> 38:49.790
By the way, Mrs. Hannah was just here,
and she told me

38:49.834 --> 38:52.663
that you helped her change a lightbulb.

38:52.706 --> 38:53.838
It was dark.

38:53.881 --> 38:55.883
Mm-hmm. And then after that, you took

38:55.927 --> 38:57.624
some cookies she made
down to a homeless shelter

38:57.668 --> 38:59.670
and stayed there for a couple of hours.

38:59.713 --> 39:02.020
It was either that
or go home and fill out

39:02.063 --> 39:03.761
those college applications, so...

39:03.804 --> 39:07.025
Is that the only reason you
went, to get out of doing work?

39:07.068 --> 39:09.462
Or maybe because you
really like to help people?

39:12.552 --> 39:14.162
I don't know.

39:14.206 --> 39:15.294
You know something, Nick?

39:15.337 --> 39:18.123
You are a lot like your father.

39:18.166 --> 39:19.820
And the world is gonna be a better place

39:19.864 --> 39:21.259
because you're in it.

39:22.083 --> 39:24.390
Once I decide what I'm actually gonna do.

39:24.433 --> 39:26.653
Well, maybe deciding what you're gonna do

39:26.697 --> 39:30.048
isn't as important
as realizing who you are,

39:30.091 --> 39:31.440
because it's the goodness in a person

39:31.484 --> 39:33.268
that's really gonna change the world.

39:35.586 --> 39:37.926
So why did you want to
come back to this old mill?

39:37.951 --> 39:39.187
Because I've decided

39:39.231 --> 39:42.626
that this is one of the most
romantic places in Middleton.

39:42.669 --> 39:44.802
It does have a lot going for it.

39:44.845 --> 39:48.675
And... I've decided that this
would be the perfect place

39:48.719 --> 39:51.330
to put my company's headquarters.

39:51.373 --> 39:54.638
- In a run-down old mill?
- Yeah!

39:54.681 --> 39:57.336
I already put an application
in with City Hall to buy it

39:57.379 --> 39:59.425
and restore it,
and once I get the approval,

39:59.468 --> 40:01.122
I can start moving my operations here.

40:01.166 --> 40:02.907
So that means you'd
be living in Middleton.

40:02.950 --> 40:05.649
Yeah!

40:05.692 --> 40:07.999
So it's a good thing I already
really like the people here.

40:16.485 --> 40:17.748
Sam.

40:19.097 --> 40:21.012
Cassie.

40:21.055 --> 40:22.274
Welcome home.

40:23.667 --> 40:25.146
I told Nick I wanted to wait up

40:25.190 --> 40:27.932
for you so I could see you
as soon as you got back.

40:28.409 --> 40:30.238
Well, I'm back.

40:30.282 --> 40:31.788
It's good to see you.

40:39.291 --> 40:41.032
What are those?

40:41.075 --> 40:43.556
Nick finished filling out
his college applications.

40:44.731 --> 40:45.993
- Wow.
- Uh-huh.

40:46.037 --> 40:47.952
I'm gonna leave you in charge more often.

40:47.995 --> 40:49.736
I was hoping you wouldn't
have to leave at all.

40:50.998 --> 40:53.609
But I understand why you do.

40:53.653 --> 40:55.307
Hmm.

40:57.483 --> 40:59.311
Life is a risk,

40:59.354 --> 41:01.400
and we don't know
what might happen tomorrow,

41:01.443 --> 41:03.054
which makes every moment

41:03.097 --> 41:05.273
we do have together even more important.

41:06.666 --> 41:08.624
So...

41:08.668 --> 41:10.104
I'm gonna love you as if

41:10.148 --> 41:11.932
each day was the only one we had.

41:14.718 --> 41:17.721
Sounds like the perfect way
to start a life together.

41:19.200 --> 41:20.636
Speaking of that...

41:22.813 --> 41:24.815
What's this?

41:24.858 --> 41:27.600
I wrote down when I wanted
our wedding day to be.

41:34.128 --> 41:36.019
That's less than three weeks away.

41:36.957 --> 41:38.089
We better get to work.

41:38.132 --> 41:41.832
So amazing
