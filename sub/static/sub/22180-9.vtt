WEBVTT

00:06.385 --> 00:07.786
Julie, honey, don't move.

00:07.787 --> 00:09.321
- Okay? Just...
- Just stay.

00:09.322 --> 00:11.056
- Just don't move.
- Stay, just-just stay right where you are.

00:11.057 --> 00:12.557
- Stay very still, sweetheart. You're okay.
- Everything's fine.

00:12.558 --> 00:13.992
- Everything's fine.
- No, stay...

00:13.993 --> 00:15.960
- Will somebody please call for help?
- Mom?

00:15.961 --> 00:17.418
MAN: Everything's fine.
We need help over here!

00:17.419 --> 00:18.685
You're okay, baby.
You're gonna be fine.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.297
- You're all right.
- Mom?

00:24.135 --> 00:25.704
JAY: Can you imagine?

00:25.705 --> 00:28.473
BLAKE: Why is the chopper up so high?

00:28.474 --> 00:30.208
So its downdraft
doesn't set the mines off.

00:30.209 --> 00:31.910
- MAN (ON VIDEO): Yeah.
- WOMAN: All right, Julie.

00:31.911 --> 00:33.945
MATT: Would not have thought of that.

00:33.946 --> 00:35.413
(CHEERING)

00:35.414 --> 00:36.715
ELIZABETH: Oh, good,

00:36.716 --> 00:37.882
you guys are watching the video?

00:37.883 --> 00:39.751
- Yes.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:39.752 --> 00:41.853
What do you see?

00:41.854 --> 00:45.056
Uh, a heroic rescue of a child?

00:45.057 --> 00:46.725
- Some really stupid parents.
- Yeah.

00:46.726 --> 00:49.259
Well, I see an opportunity.

00:54.032 --> 00:55.266
BLAKE: Whoa.

00:55.267 --> 00:56.668
- Holy...
- This...

00:56.669 --> 00:57.902
is an antipersonnel land mine.

00:57.903 --> 00:59.170
Don't worry, it's deactivated.

00:59.171 --> 01:01.506
But if it weren't, it would just take

01:01.507 --> 01:03.441
a few pounds of pressure...

01:03.442 --> 01:06.211
say, the weight of
a young girl's foot...

01:06.212 --> 01:08.613
to detonate it. But, interestingly,

01:08.614 --> 01:10.315
these aren't designed to kill.

01:10.316 --> 01:11.449
The idea

01:11.450 --> 01:13.284
is to burden the enemy

01:13.285 --> 01:15.053
with logistical difficulties

01:15.054 --> 01:17.856
like evacuation and field surgery

01:17.857 --> 01:21.626
by blowing off the leg
of the soldier who steps on it.

01:21.627 --> 01:23.895
Of course, very often,

01:23.896 --> 01:26.197
the victims aren't soldiers at all.

01:26.198 --> 01:27.532
They're civilians.

01:27.533 --> 01:30.068
Children.

01:30.069 --> 01:31.770
Thank you.

01:31.771 --> 01:34.005
Good morning to you, too, ma'am.

01:34.006 --> 01:35.573
Where'd you get that thing anyway?

01:35.574 --> 01:37.275
ELIZABETH: Friend of mine at DOD.

01:37.276 --> 01:38.943
Wasn't easy, which is weird,

01:38.944 --> 01:42.547
because there are 100 million

01:42.548 --> 01:45.183
of them buried around the world,

01:45.184 --> 01:47.819
and another 110 million stockpiled.

01:47.820 --> 01:50.622
I'm sorry for the dramatics.

01:50.623 --> 01:54.292
I just want us all to be real
focused on the opportunity

01:54.293 --> 01:55.860
- at hand here.
- Which is what, ma'am?

01:55.861 --> 01:58.096
The Calgary Treaty on Land Mines.

01:58.097 --> 01:59.531
Called for the worldwide ban

01:59.532 --> 02:01.733
on the production, stockpiling, use

02:01.734 --> 02:03.368
and transfer
of antipersonnel land mines.

02:03.369 --> 02:05.236
It was ratified
in the late '90s, I believe?

02:05.237 --> 02:08.440
- Yup.
- And was signed by at least 100 countries,

02:08.441 --> 02:09.707
of which the U.S. was not one,

02:09.708 --> 02:11.509
but we are... broadly compliant.

02:11.510 --> 02:13.511
Okay, but why haven't we signed it?

02:13.512 --> 02:15.204
JAY: Ratification would
take a two-thirds vote

02:15.205 --> 02:17.940
in the Senate, which
no previous administration

02:17.941 --> 02:19.408
has been able to secure.

02:19.409 --> 02:21.915
Because the Pentagon has issues.
We don't use land mines, except

02:21.916 --> 02:24.451
on the Korean Peninsula.
But DOD doesn't want to create

02:24.452 --> 02:27.054
a legal slippery slope for other
effective but controversial

02:27.055 --> 02:30.357
weapons systems, like... cluster bombs,

02:30.358 --> 02:32.492
and white phosphorus munitions,

02:32.493 --> 02:34.361
or, I don't know, exploding puppies.

02:34.362 --> 02:35.896
JAY: Plus, Russia and China

02:35.897 --> 02:37.731
are big producers, too, but also

02:37.732 --> 02:39.466
- won't sign.
- ELIZABETH: Right. I mean,

02:39.467 --> 02:41.435
correct answers.
Check pluses all around.

02:41.436 --> 02:43.203
But why else haven't we

02:43.204 --> 02:45.305
signed this treaty?

02:45.306 --> 02:46.873
This is the scariest pop quiz ever.

02:46.874 --> 02:49.609
What <i>aren't</i> the thousands

02:49.610 --> 02:50.877
of innocent civilians

02:50.878 --> 02:55.115
who are maimed or killed
by land mines every year?

02:55.116 --> 02:56.350
Americans.

02:56.351 --> 02:58.352
- Exactly.
- But that video's gotten

02:58.353 --> 03:00.253
- five million views already.
- So, for this

03:00.254 --> 03:02.289
brief moment in time,

03:02.290 --> 03:05.759
Americans are actually
thinking about land mines.

03:05.760 --> 03:09.496
Imagine how many thousands
of lives we could save

03:09.497 --> 03:11.565
- if the U.S. would finally
- (PHONE RINGS)

03:11.566 --> 03:13.367
provide real moral leadership

03:13.368 --> 03:15.469
- and ratify Calgary.
- BLAKE: Secretary's office.

03:15.470 --> 03:17.637
- But we got to act fast. Right?
- Yes, I'll let her know. Ma'am,

03:17.638 --> 03:19.673
Russell Jackson just asked
to see you as soon as possible.

03:19.674 --> 03:22.275
He <i>asked?</i>
He even used the word "please."

03:22.276 --> 03:24.277
Oh, I don't like the sound of that.

03:24.278 --> 03:26.747
NOLAN: <i>Recent leaks to the
Russians could be traced back</i>

03:26.748 --> 03:28.982
to Senate Majority Leader
Beau Carpenter.

03:28.983 --> 03:30.450
Now, the evidence was gathered

03:30.451 --> 03:32.619
by CIA's Special Activities Division,

03:32.620 --> 03:34.354
but it won't be admissible in court.

03:34.355 --> 03:35.889
That is the purpose

03:35.890 --> 03:38.024
of this inter-agency task force:

03:38.025 --> 03:39.760
to build a case against
Carpenter that sticks.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.261
RUSSELL: Here's what's bumping me:

03:41.262 --> 03:43.964
Carpenter's one of the most
powerful men in the country.

03:43.965 --> 03:46.166
He's plenty rich.
He's not an ideologue.

03:46.167 --> 03:47.968
Do we really think

03:47.969 --> 03:50.070
he could've been coerced
by the Russians?

03:50.071 --> 03:51.538
HENRY: Well, that's the question.

03:51.539 --> 03:53.106
What leverage do they have on him?

03:53.107 --> 03:55.642
Anthony Colvert from the FBI
will lead the investigation.

03:55.643 --> 03:57.878
Thank you, Mr. Attorney General.

03:57.879 --> 03:59.513
It's true, Leader Carpenter

03:59.514 --> 04:01.548
doesn't have many
obvious pressure points.

04:01.549 --> 04:04.351
His wife of 40 years,
Helen, passed away

04:04.352 --> 04:06.853
five years ago. His son
Richard is in business

04:06.854 --> 04:08.722
and seems to be reasonably successful.

04:08.723 --> 04:10.891
The most compelling answer
to Dr. McCord's question

04:10.892 --> 04:13.760
is Carpenter's housekeeper: Magda Nagy.

04:13.761 --> 04:15.829
She grew up under
communist rule in Budapest,

04:15.830 --> 04:17.397
presumably speaks some Russian.

04:17.398 --> 04:19.599
Became an American citizen
15 years ago.

04:19.600 --> 04:21.101
Started working
as Carpenter's housekeeper

04:21.101 --> 04:22.536
shortly after his wife died.

04:22.537 --> 04:25.172
NOLAN: The leaks we believe Leader
Carpenter is responsible for

04:25.173 --> 04:27.574
have blown operations and cost lives.

04:27.575 --> 04:30.076
CIA will assist
in intelligence gathering

04:30.077 --> 04:32.546
but, obviously, FBI runs point on this.

04:32.547 --> 04:34.480
Thanks, everyone.

04:35.615 --> 04:37.117
RUSSELL: If I may.

04:37.118 --> 04:41.321
I've known Beau Carpenter for 25 years.

04:41.322 --> 04:44.257
He's charming as all hell.

04:44.258 --> 04:46.626
He's also crafty

04:46.627 --> 04:49.496
and has this town wired.

04:49.497 --> 04:51.698
Don't let him see you coming.

04:51.699 --> 04:54.434
Land mines only cost
a few dollars to make,

04:54.435 --> 04:56.269
but thousands to clean up.

04:56.270 --> 04:59.639
They render otherwise arable
land useless for decades.

04:59.640 --> 05:01.608
Yes, and the U.S. contributes

05:01.609 --> 05:05.011
far more to de-mining operations
than any other country.

05:05.012 --> 05:06.980
Sure, but how can we tell them

05:06.981 --> 05:10.383
to stop using and selling mines
when they can say to us,

05:10.384 --> 05:13.920
"Well, you won't ratify
Calgary. Why should we".

05:13.921 --> 05:15.856
I'm sympathetic.

05:15.857 --> 05:18.258
But we have other
legislative priorities

05:18.259 --> 05:20.827
to get through Congress
before the recess.

05:20.828 --> 05:22.596
Conrad, you've seen, firsthand,

05:22.597 --> 05:23.964
the damage they can do.

05:23.965 --> 05:25.866
Yes, I have.

05:25.867 --> 05:27.434
So believe me when I tell you

05:27.435 --> 05:29.336
that I understand this issue, Bess.

05:29.337 --> 05:31.371
Well, then you, of all people,

05:31.372 --> 05:33.106
can understand the moral imperative

05:33.107 --> 05:35.175
to putting an end to their use.

05:35.176 --> 05:36.309
RUSSELL: Mr. President.

05:36.310 --> 05:37.677
- Elizabeth.
- Hey.

05:37.678 --> 05:40.447
Did you bring a land mine
to the office?

05:40.448 --> 05:42.682
- I was making a point.
- Yeah.

05:42.683 --> 05:44.017
That's what most people
who bring weapons

05:44.018 --> 05:45.252
to the workplace say.

05:45.253 --> 05:47.454
She's passionate
on the subject, Russell.

05:47.455 --> 05:49.289
Yeah, well, my two cents:

05:49.290 --> 05:51.191
sending a treaty to the
Senate is just asking them

05:51.192 --> 05:52.459
to stick a thumb in your eye.

05:52.460 --> 05:54.127
And why the hell did that family

05:54.128 --> 05:56.530
have to go to Cambodia
instead of on a Disney cruise,

05:56.531 --> 05:57.898
like normal people?

05:57.899 --> 05:59.666
(ELIZABETH SIGHS)

05:59.667 --> 06:02.135
I know it's risky, but I think

06:02.136 --> 06:04.170
right now we have the public's support

06:04.171 --> 06:05.572
to get something done here.

06:05.573 --> 06:09.342
A two-thirds majority
is a high bar, Bess.

06:09.343 --> 06:12.279
I don't want to squander
my capital on a political loser.

06:12.280 --> 06:14.147
I know.

06:14.148 --> 06:15.448
(SIGHS)

06:15.449 --> 06:17.183
But I tell you what.

06:17.184 --> 06:19.052
On an issue like this,

06:19.053 --> 06:21.254
you have the stature

06:21.255 --> 06:23.423
to try and whip the votes yourself.

06:23.424 --> 06:26.626
If you can do that, I'll sign.

06:26.627 --> 06:28.828
(EXHALES) Well, I love a challenge.

06:28.829 --> 06:31.531
- Thank you, sir.
- Just remember what he said

06:31.532 --> 06:33.499
about political losers.

06:39.573 --> 06:41.007
You're in a mood.

06:41.008 --> 06:42.642
Ugh.

06:42.643 --> 06:45.679
You got any plans this weekend?

06:45.680 --> 06:47.547
Um... I don't know,

06:47.548 --> 06:49.349
reading, mostly.

06:49.350 --> 06:51.484
Got to hit the grocery store.

06:51.485 --> 06:53.753
You know, probably
put on my yoga pants,

06:53.754 --> 06:55.055
but not actually go.

06:55.056 --> 06:56.590
- (CHUCKLES)
- You?

06:56.591 --> 06:58.491
Well, I was supposed
to go to Bunny Duncan's

06:58.492 --> 06:59.693
big holiday party.

06:59.694 --> 07:01.428
Well, you know, she has one every year.

07:01.429 --> 07:03.263
She passed away last night. I heard.

07:03.264 --> 07:05.999
Russell, I'm so sorry.
You were friends.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.867
Bunny? God no, I hated her.

07:07.868 --> 07:09.369
Oh.

07:09.370 --> 07:11.304
Everybody loved her parties.

07:11.305 --> 07:12.906
They were just scared
of getting left out.

07:12.907 --> 07:15.775
It was like drinking eggnog
at Saddam Hussein's palace.

07:15.776 --> 07:17.177
No, no, no, the point is...

07:17.178 --> 07:19.813
the real estate's free,
but not for long.

07:19.814 --> 07:23.049
So if you and Henry want to
throw a party of your own,

07:23.050 --> 07:25.118
you need to jump now.

07:25.119 --> 07:26.353
Well, it's a good thing...

07:26.354 --> 07:28.187
- we don't.
- What, uh...

07:28.888 --> 07:30.924
Maybe I'm not making myself clear.

07:30.925 --> 07:32.192
Fair to say.

07:32.193 --> 07:34.461
POTUS is thinking about his legacy.

07:34.462 --> 07:35.695
When the time comes,

07:35.696 --> 07:39.466
- he wants to pass the torch to you, so...
- Oh, wow.

07:39.467 --> 07:40.867
- If you're gonna run...
- I'm not.

07:40.868 --> 07:42.569
...we need to start making moves now...

07:42.570 --> 07:44.571
getting the right team together,
meeting the right people.

07:44.572 --> 07:46.873
- Throwing the right parties.
- You'll do it, then.

07:46.874 --> 07:49.676
- Thank you.
- Maybe I'm the one not being clear.

07:49.677 --> 07:51.878
I came here to serve the president,

07:51.879 --> 07:53.979
not <i>be</i> the president.

07:56.383 --> 07:58.084
Just think about it, please?

07:58.085 --> 07:59.919
Good-bye, Russell.

07:59.920 --> 08:01.655
And fast.

08:01.656 --> 08:04.491
All right, so, to ratify
Calgary, we need 67 senators.

08:04.492 --> 08:06.226
There are basically
three pools of votes.

08:06.227 --> 08:08.428
The yeses, of whom
there aren't enough. But then,

08:08.429 --> 08:11.731
there are two kinds
of no votes: the defense hawks,

08:11.732 --> 08:13.600
who tend to take their
cues from the military;

08:13.601 --> 08:15.635
and those who will never
vote for any treaty

08:15.636 --> 08:16.870
because they're afraid

08:16.871 --> 08:19.039
of a loss of U.S. sovereignty.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.473
AKA the black helicopter crowd.

08:20.474 --> 08:23.176
- Carlos Morejon jumps to mind.
- Fun fact:

08:23.177 --> 08:25.211
his wife Vicki did retweet
the rescue video.

08:25.212 --> 08:27.514
- His heartlessness completes her.
- Oh.

08:27.515 --> 08:29.449
Long story short, ma'am,
getting the votes

08:29.450 --> 08:30.550
before the congressional recess

08:30.551 --> 08:33.119
- will be a pretty heavy lift.
- Yup.

08:33.120 --> 08:34.621
- Gordon Becker is your answer.
- Okay.

08:34.621 --> 08:36.655
- Mike B, ma'am.
- Yes,

08:36.657 --> 08:39.458
with his impeccable timing. Mike,

08:39.460 --> 08:42.361
this is my new policy
advisor, Kat Sandoval.

08:42.363 --> 08:44.297
Kat, Mike; Mike, Kat.

08:44.298 --> 08:47.267
Mr. Barnow, good to meet you.
Your reputation precedes you.

08:47.268 --> 08:48.468
As does yours.

08:48.469 --> 08:50.270
Didn't you go crazy or something?

08:50.271 --> 08:53.373
Actually, I just moved to an
avocado farm in California.

08:53.374 --> 08:55.709
That sounds like the same thing.

08:55.710 --> 08:57.644
What's this really about?

08:57.645 --> 08:59.779
Ah, troubled by a nagging feeling

08:59.780 --> 09:02.148
your dog likes me more than you.

09:02.149 --> 09:04.050
I will have you know that Gordon and I

09:04.051 --> 09:05.719
are in a really good place right now.

09:05.720 --> 09:06.920
Gordon?

09:06.921 --> 09:08.855
(LAUGHS): Wait, Go... I'm sorry.

09:08.856 --> 09:10.523
Gordon the dog, as in

09:10.524 --> 09:12.559
- Gordon the SecDef?
- For the record, he's named after

09:12.560 --> 09:14.594
G. Gordon Liddy,
who also had his quirks,

09:14.595 --> 09:16.463
but was fanatically loyal.

09:16.464 --> 09:18.465
To an unworthy master. Makes sense.

09:18.466 --> 09:20.500
Getting back to the Gordon
that matters,

09:20.501 --> 09:22.135
tell us how SecDef figures into this.

09:22.136 --> 09:23.503
Way to keep us on track.

09:23.504 --> 09:24.704
You're no Nadine, but I appreciate

09:24.705 --> 09:27.407
the effort. Look, even if a senator,

09:27.408 --> 09:28.808
in their heart,

09:28.809 --> 09:30.610
wants to vote yes,
they can't look weak on defense.

09:30.611 --> 09:32.011
So you have to give them some cover.

09:32.012 --> 09:34.547
And getting Becker to come out in favor

09:34.548 --> 09:36.816
of ratifying Calgary does just that.

09:36.817 --> 09:38.485
I like it. Blake, get me a meeting

09:38.486 --> 09:41.154
with SecDef, will you?

09:41.155 --> 09:43.123
So, I hear you're throwing
a party this weekend.

09:43.124 --> 09:44.390
And Bunny Duncan's

09:44.391 --> 09:46.359
not even in the ground yet.

09:46.360 --> 09:47.994
I love it. Sounds like the White House

09:47.995 --> 09:50.130
is having you lay the
groundwork for a run.

09:50.131 --> 09:53.099
Oh, she didn't tell you? Oops.

09:53.100 --> 09:55.068
Because it's not happening.

09:55.069 --> 09:56.803
JAY: What, you just

09:56.804 --> 09:58.004
turned POTUS down?

09:58.005 --> 09:59.239
Well, Russell.

09:59.240 --> 10:01.374
Look, I'm not into all that

10:01.375 --> 10:04.644
backslapping, join-the-club malarkey.

10:04.645 --> 10:07.013
Oh, and I don't want to be president.

10:07.014 --> 10:09.315
Although if you did
throw the party, you could

10:09.316 --> 10:11.050
use the informal setting...

10:11.051 --> 10:12.519
not to mention
official Washington's curiosity

10:12.520 --> 10:13.820
with The Glamorous McCords...

10:13.821 --> 10:15.622
as a lure to trawl

10:15.623 --> 10:18.892
- for more treaty votes.
- So not glamorous, just...

10:18.893 --> 10:21.461
But nevertheless, I like it.

10:21.462 --> 10:22.896
- Right?
- That's a good idea.

10:22.897 --> 10:25.265
No. No, it's not a good idea.

10:25.266 --> 10:27.100
It's a terrible idea.

10:27.101 --> 10:28.968
These parties are non-partisan;

10:28.969 --> 10:30.537
therefore, they're actually fun.

10:30.538 --> 10:32.605
I mean, sure, tell everyone
you want to run for president,

10:32.606 --> 10:33.973
but don't...

10:33.974 --> 10:36.576
don't dance on poor
Bunny's grave talking politics.

10:36.577 --> 10:37.877
Blake, call the White House.

10:37.878 --> 10:40.647
Tell Russell Jackson
I'll throw the stupid party.

10:40.648 --> 10:43.783
Don't say "stupid".

10:43.784 --> 10:51.426
Subtitle sync and corrections by

10:55.117 --> 10:57.619
Madam Secretary? I'm Meghan Pearl.

10:57.620 --> 11:00.201
Russell Jackson suggested I ride
over to the Pentagon with you.

11:00.202 --> 11:01.456
Oh. Yes, the-the party planner.

11:01.457 --> 11:03.292
Uh, event coordinator.

11:03.293 --> 11:05.694
Oh. Apologies.

11:05.695 --> 11:08.541
This is Blake, my assistant.

11:08.542 --> 11:11.044
Oh. Great. You'll probably
want to take notes.

11:11.045 --> 11:13.680
We are going to cover a lot of ground.

11:13.681 --> 11:15.448
Shall we?

11:15.449 --> 11:18.051
After you.

11:18.052 --> 11:20.352
Thank you.

11:21.854 --> 11:23.790
ELIZABETH: <i>Meghan, thank you</i>

11:23.791 --> 11:25.658
for coming on such short notice.

11:25.659 --> 11:27.727
Well, normally, I don't do
events this small, and,

11:27.728 --> 11:30.663
honestly, I was this close to
doing Bunny Duncan's memorial.

11:30.664 --> 11:33.099
- "Oh.
- But Russell Jackson swore

11:33.100 --> 11:35.334
up and down that you would be worth it.

11:35.335 --> 11:38.771
Well, let's hope I don't let you down.

11:38.772 --> 11:40.540
- "(CHUCKLES)
- Uh, so, Meghan,

11:40.541 --> 11:42.274
shall we talk about your
vision for the party?

11:42.275 --> 11:45.178
Yes. Nothing too
elaborate... passed apps;

11:45.179 --> 11:48.181
two to three dining stations;
three or four full bars;

11:48.182 --> 11:51.384
TBD live entertainment;
plus, a tasteful DJ;

11:51.385 --> 11:53.286
heated tents, front and back;

11:53.287 --> 11:55.722
valets; and then, of
course, party favors.

11:55.723 --> 11:57.423
So, you know, simple.

11:57.424 --> 11:59.325
Party favors. Huh.

11:59.326 --> 12:01.360
You know, a small gift
for each of your guests.

12:01.361 --> 12:04.163
I know what a party favor... is, I...

12:04.164 --> 12:07.500
Just wondering if they're necessary.

12:07.501 --> 12:09.736
Well, I mean,

12:09.737 --> 12:12.004
that's how it's done.

12:12.005 --> 12:13.439
Mm.

12:13.440 --> 12:15.875
But, of course, it's up to you.

12:15.876 --> 12:17.542
Thank you.

12:19.345 --> 12:22.615
So, with the...

12:22.616 --> 12:24.684
- valets,
- Mm-hmm.

12:24.685 --> 12:27.053
the caterer, bars...

12:27.054 --> 12:28.087
The party favors.

12:28.088 --> 12:29.722
Party favors. Thank you.

12:29.723 --> 12:32.091
How much is this all gonna cost?

12:32.092 --> 12:34.293
Well, typically, I don't
discuss that with clients

12:34.294 --> 12:36.763
this early in the process.

12:36.764 --> 12:38.731
Oh.

12:38.732 --> 12:39.966
Well, I'll tell you what.

12:39.967 --> 12:43.034
Uh, why don't you write it down for me?

12:46.506 --> 12:48.940
Sure.

12:51.878 --> 12:54.180
Again, thanks so much for making time.

12:54.181 --> 12:56.649
Thank you, ma'am. And let me
know about those ice sculptures.

12:56.650 --> 12:58.117
Oh, you bet!

12:58.118 --> 13:01.754
- Yeah, she's not gonna work.
- No.

13:01.755 --> 13:04.690
One concern is setting a legal
precedent that could be used

13:04.691 --> 13:05.892
to ban other weapons in the future.

13:05.893 --> 13:07.894
Well, I understand that,

13:07.895 --> 13:09.862
but we banned nerve gas

13:09.863 --> 13:12.899
and it's not like our troops
are out there with peashooters.

13:12.900 --> 13:15.134
Fair point. Two other stumbling blocks:

13:15.135 --> 13:17.303
the Korean Peninsula
and our good friends,

13:17.304 --> 13:19.338
- the Russians and the Chinese.
- I agree.

13:19.339 --> 13:23.810
We'd have to find something
to carve out for South Korea.

13:23.811 --> 13:26.345
But talk to me about Russia and China.

13:26.346 --> 13:28.381
Well, unlike us, they're
actively selling and deploying

13:28.382 --> 13:30.616
their APLs. If our two
biggest adversaries

13:30.617 --> 13:32.418
won't disarm, why should we?

13:32.419 --> 13:34.487
Because we haven't used
land mines in combat

13:34.488 --> 13:36.022
since the '90s anyway.

13:36.023 --> 13:38.057
And it's doubtful we ever will.

13:38.058 --> 13:41.327
Nevertheless, I say the onus
is on Russia and China.

13:41.328 --> 13:43.296
Well, I hear you.

13:43.297 --> 13:45.563
Want to?

13:46.299 --> 13:49.001
Why not?

13:49.002 --> 13:51.070
I don't know. Just seems...

13:51.071 --> 13:52.839
(SIGHS)

13:52.840 --> 13:54.674
With everything going on,

13:54.675 --> 13:57.310
I do think that Russia's
a bridge too far.

13:57.311 --> 13:59.245
But...

13:59.246 --> 14:00.913
if I could deliver China?

14:00.914 --> 14:02.882
(CHUCKLES) Deliver China.

14:02.883 --> 14:05.384
- Just like that?
- I mean,

14:05.385 --> 14:07.953
I'm not saying it would be easy.

14:09.121 --> 14:10.523
- Yeah.
- Nice.

14:10.524 --> 14:12.658
But if I could,

14:12.659 --> 14:15.661
would you come out
in support of ratification?

14:15.662 --> 14:18.531
Depends exactly what China agrees to.

14:18.532 --> 14:19.999
But...

14:20.000 --> 14:22.468
yes, I would.

14:22.469 --> 14:24.869
Hmm. Okay, then.

14:26.339 --> 14:28.341
Nice putting game there,
Madam Secretary.

14:28.342 --> 14:33.012
We both know anybody can
smack a ball down a fairway.

14:33.013 --> 14:36.349
It's staying calm and executing
when the hole is right there,

14:36.350 --> 14:39.217
that's the tricky part.

14:39.952 --> 14:41.888
Thank you, Gordon.

14:41.889 --> 14:44.156
You're very welcome, Elizabeth.

14:44.157 --> 14:46.392
Let's kick around
this whole Magda theory.

14:46.393 --> 14:48.361
And, please, no a priori arguments

14:48.362 --> 14:50.329
or confirmation bias.
Give me the facts.

14:50.330 --> 14:52.665
44 years old. Divorced.

14:52.666 --> 14:54.000
One daughter, age 12.

14:54.001 --> 14:55.868
Been working
for Majority Leader Carpenter

14:55.869 --> 14:58.137
for about five years
since his wife died.

14:58.138 --> 15:00.239
Works most days, leaves at night.

15:00.240 --> 15:02.275
- And does she?
- From what

15:02.276 --> 15:03.943
we've been able to glean,
no one in town thinks

15:03.944 --> 15:05.244
there's anything going on between them.

15:05.245 --> 15:06.946
And with the wife gone,
why keep a secret

15:06.947 --> 15:08.681
when they don't have to?

15:08.682 --> 15:10.616
So the honey trap
theory's kind of squishy.

15:10.617 --> 15:13.886
Is there any possibility that she's...

15:13.887 --> 15:16.522
just his handler for the Russians?

15:16.523 --> 15:18.024
ANGELA: FBI's still doing

15:18.025 --> 15:19.325
their background check, but, so far,

15:19.326 --> 15:21.027
her financials
don't really give us much.

15:21.028 --> 15:24.196
No big deposits or purchases in cash.

15:24.197 --> 15:27.700
(GRUNTS) So, in the words of Aristotle,

15:27.701 --> 15:30.002
we got jack squat.

15:30.003 --> 15:31.070
But here's something.

15:31.071 --> 15:32.738
Sometimes she posts the route

15:32.739 --> 15:34.573
of her runs on social media.

15:34.574 --> 15:35.675
Why do people do that,

15:35.676 --> 15:36.943
by the way?

15:36.944 --> 15:39.812
I mean... Anyway, most
mornings, she goes through

15:39.813 --> 15:42.148
the Woodmont Triangle
neighborhood in Bethesda.

15:42.149 --> 15:43.399
It's something concrete
to go on, at least.

15:43.400 --> 15:46.352
I'm gonna get in touch with Colvert.
If Magda takes a run in the morning,

15:46.353 --> 15:47.687
we should be ready for her.

15:47.688 --> 15:49.889
ELIZABETH: <i>So, what is in it</i>

15:49.890 --> 15:51.090
for China?

15:51.091 --> 15:52.458
Why should they sign the treaty?

15:52.459 --> 15:53.993
MIKE: Don't look at me. I'm just here

15:53.994 --> 15:55.461
to get out of picking
my kid up from hockey.

15:55.462 --> 15:58.731
Truth is, we can't offer much

15:58.732 --> 16:00.199
that would mean anything to them.

16:00.200 --> 16:01.233
KAT: Maybe we appeal

16:01.234 --> 16:02.234
to their vanity?

16:02.235 --> 16:03.469
How so?

16:03.470 --> 16:05.404
Well, China's a superpower now.

16:05.405 --> 16:07.239
Do they really need
to mine their borders?

16:07.240 --> 16:09.275
- Who's going to invade China?
- JAY: And land mines

16:09.276 --> 16:10.743
are a pretty grubby export

16:10.744 --> 16:12.545
when you're making
everything else under the sun.

16:12.546 --> 16:13.746
ELIZABETH: Maybe.

16:13.747 --> 16:14.780
Could work.

16:14.781 --> 16:16.782
Look who's here.

16:16.783 --> 16:18.284
Hi, Mom.

16:18.285 --> 16:19.885
Mom's staff.

16:19.886 --> 16:22.888
Hi, honey. This is a... surprise.

16:22.889 --> 16:25.658
Sure is. Yeah.

16:25.659 --> 16:28.227
Oh, my God.

16:28.228 --> 16:29.862
- He didn't.
- Russell thought

16:29.863 --> 16:32.698
that since money seemed
to be an issue with Meghan,

16:32.699 --> 16:36.035
maybe a... volunteer family member

16:36.036 --> 16:38.270
- might be more in your price range.
- Ouch.

16:38.271 --> 16:39.538
ELIZABETH: And he thinks

16:39.539 --> 16:42.008
just because you're a woman, of course,

16:42.009 --> 16:44.176
you'd want to plan a party?

16:44.177 --> 16:48.848
I think it's more that
you just can't fire me.

16:48.849 --> 16:49.849
Right.

16:49.850 --> 16:51.517
And you're okay with this?

16:51.518 --> 16:54.320
Yeah. Absolutely.

16:54.321 --> 16:55.888
My God, it's like a hostage video.

16:55.889 --> 16:59.358
Um, so I-I have options

16:59.359 --> 17:01.494
for caterers, valets,
decorations and everything.

17:01.495 --> 17:03.729
I also have a draft of the guest list

17:03.730 --> 17:06.298
- that you kind of need to look over.
- Yeah. Okay, well, we're just

17:06.299 --> 17:08.768
sort of busy around here. So
we'll go over it tonight.

17:08.769 --> 17:11.537
- Okay? All right.
- Okay. Mom, this party is tomorrow.

17:11.538 --> 17:14.773
I know. Ticktock. We'll be okay.

17:14.775 --> 17:16.809
Also, I'm a public servant
and your dad's a teacher,

17:16.810 --> 17:18.310
so whatever you think
something should cost,

17:18.310 --> 17:19.979
make it half that, okay?
I love you. Bye.

17:19.980 --> 17:22.213
- What? Mom...
- Bye, honey.

17:26.484 --> 17:28.287
Minister Chen, as you know,

17:28.288 --> 17:30.623
APLs stay lethal for decades,

17:30.624 --> 17:32.992
killing women and children who are just

17:32.993 --> 17:35.428
trying to grow crops or fetch firewood.

17:35.429 --> 17:38.431
Can you honestly tell me
that China, with all of its

17:38.432 --> 17:41.267
economic and military
might, still needs

17:41.268 --> 17:43.669
such weapons?

17:43.670 --> 17:45.638
There have been
some internal discussions

17:45.639 --> 17:47.506
about that very topic.

17:47.507 --> 17:48.974
So let's make something happen.

17:48.975 --> 17:51.877
The world's two great powers
coming together on this issue

17:51.878 --> 17:54.346
holds some appeal.

17:54.347 --> 17:56.215
We might consider it, if...

17:56.216 --> 17:58.184
- If what?
- If you go first.

17:58.185 --> 17:59.385
Well, I told you we can't do that.

17:59.386 --> 18:00.820
So why should we?

18:00.821 --> 18:01.954
Good day, Madam Secretary.

18:01.955 --> 18:04.990
Wait, wait, wait. Are you saying that

18:04.991 --> 18:07.860
if we ratify first, you'll follow suit?

18:07.861 --> 18:10.229
We would take it as a heartening sign

18:10.230 --> 18:12.231
and move to match it.

18:12.232 --> 18:14.166
Well, let me get back to you.

18:14.167 --> 18:16.635
Madam Secretary, a little bird

18:16.636 --> 18:19.138
told me you're having a holiday party

18:19.139 --> 18:21.540
in place of the late Bunny Duncan.

18:21.541 --> 18:23.709
Now, what are we to make of that?

18:23.710 --> 18:26.112
Nothing to make of it, Ming.

18:26.113 --> 18:27.980
Talk soon.

18:27.981 --> 18:30.483
Wow, the world has gotten
way too small.

18:30.484 --> 18:31.984
But that was promising.

18:31.985 --> 18:34.253
KAT: So, to sum up, in
order to get the White House

18:34.254 --> 18:36.455
on board, we have to get
the votes in the Senate.

18:36.456 --> 18:39.091
Uh, in order to get those,
we have to get the SecDef.

18:39.092 --> 18:40.726
In order to get him,
we have to get China.

18:40.727 --> 18:42.526
And in order to get China,
we have to get POTUS?

18:42.527 --> 18:44.930
- POTUS. We're back where we started.
- Yeah.

18:44.931 --> 18:47.967
Yes, but we've learned so much.
I'm actually serious.

18:47.968 --> 18:49.568
The White House couldn't
have been clearer

18:49.569 --> 18:52.705
that they didn't want to expend
political capital on this.

18:52.706 --> 18:53.839
And yet, that is

18:53.840 --> 18:56.408
exactly what we are going
to ask them to do.

18:56.409 --> 18:58.310
Well, that's one way to cool their jets

18:58.311 --> 18:59.678
on you running for president.

18:59.679 --> 19:02.614
Two birds, one stone. Perfect.

19:07.482 --> 19:11.135
First, I want to thank you all
for taking the time to meet with me.

19:11.136 --> 19:13.109
- JASON: Oh, God,
Stevie's cycling high.

19:13.110 --> 19:14.978
I knew I should've eaten at school.

19:14.979 --> 19:17.013
STEVIE: As you know,
it has fallen to me

19:17.014 --> 19:19.549
to plan Mom's holiday party
at the house.

19:19.550 --> 19:22.852
I'm not gonna lie,
it's-it's pretty stressful.

19:22.853 --> 19:24.120
Because... here is the point
of this meeting...

19:24.121 --> 19:26.656
Mom is not helping.

19:26.657 --> 19:27.924
ALISON: Let me guess,

19:27.925 --> 19:30.426
she resents having the
party, so she's doing

19:30.427 --> 19:32.428
that thing where she doesn't
really engage and kind of

19:32.429 --> 19:34.397
makes you feel like a sellout
for even being involved?

19:34.398 --> 19:35.832
- Exactly.
- HENRY: Wow.

19:35.833 --> 19:37.200
Is that what you guys do all day,

19:37.201 --> 19:38.935
sit around and psychoanalyze us?

19:38.936 --> 19:40.603
Of course you would think that.

19:40.604 --> 19:42.539
STEVIE: So, I need you

19:42.540 --> 19:45.642
to help me help Mom. Ali,

19:45.643 --> 19:47.877
I would like for you to pick out
no more than three outfits

19:47.878 --> 19:49.145
for her. And, also, make sure

19:49.146 --> 19:51.114
that she gives herself
enough time before the party

19:51.115 --> 19:53.049
- for hair and makeup.
- I'm on it.

19:53.050 --> 19:54.717
- Great.
- Mwah.

19:54.718 --> 19:56.019
Bye. Dad,

19:56.020 --> 20:01.558
just be your normal, charming self.

20:01.559 --> 20:03.293
Mingle. Make Mom mingle.

20:03.294 --> 20:04.627
With all the right people.

20:04.628 --> 20:06.462
And who would that be?

20:06.463 --> 20:08.464
The potential campaign donors
that the White House invited.

20:08.465 --> 20:11.367
Oh, and, Dad, it's kind of tricky,

20:11.368 --> 20:13.937
but, um, gonna need you
to police your bookshelves

20:13.938 --> 20:15.672
for any controversial titles.

20:15.673 --> 20:18.675
Nope! No, no. Not happening.

20:18.676 --> 20:22.078
The First Amendment still abides
in the McCord house.

20:22.079 --> 20:22.979
Mom...

20:22.980 --> 20:25.048
What can I do to help, Stephanie?

20:25.049 --> 20:26.215
(HENRY GROANS)

20:26.216 --> 20:29.719
Just don't be a pain in the ass.

20:29.720 --> 20:31.254
Can I invite my beloved Piper?

20:31.255 --> 20:32.355
- No.
- Of course.

20:32.356 --> 20:33.523
- Mom.
- Oh, great.

20:33.524 --> 20:35.391
- So, meeting adjourned.
- Okay, I got to get to work.

20:35.392 --> 20:36.926
- Bye, honey.
- Wait, are... But you're gonna... Bye.

20:36.927 --> 20:38.266
- Bye!
- But you're gonna be at the party, right?

20:38.267 --> 20:40.597
Wait, wait, wait. Dad, did you
get all of that? Are you good?

20:40.598 --> 20:42.131
- (LAUGHS)
- Dad?

20:42.132 --> 20:44.399
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

20:47.670 --> 20:50.472
Suspect moving west.

20:53.977 --> 20:55.578
She's heading your way.

20:55.579 --> 20:57.679
Copy that.

20:59.000 --> 21:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

21:06.356 --> 21:08.557
Alexander, hand me that binder,
would you?

21:09.892 --> 21:12.160
Thanks.

21:15.765 --> 21:18.468
Okay, that guy in the driveway
works for the Russian Embassy.

21:18.469 --> 21:20.336
This is the meet.

21:20.337 --> 21:21.938
Be advised, the man

21:21.939 --> 21:23.773
at the end of the driveway is a bogie.

21:23.774 --> 21:24.941
Remember, all we need to do

21:24.942 --> 21:26.609
is document the meet. Do not approach

21:26.610 --> 21:28.844
or intercept.

21:31.547 --> 21:33.216
Tony, who the hell are those guys?

21:33.217 --> 21:37.353
COLVERT: All units, don't follow
the bogie. We're blown.

21:37.354 --> 21:39.956
(SIGHS)

21:39.957 --> 21:41.758
What was that?

21:41.759 --> 21:42.825
We agreed to coordinate on this,

21:42.826 --> 21:44.270
and you spring two extra guys on me?

21:44.271 --> 21:46.306
This is an FBI op, and
we let you come on board.

21:46.307 --> 21:48.281
Look, the brass wanted
extra assets on scene.

21:48.282 --> 21:49.622
We lost the evidence we need

21:49.623 --> 21:50.843
- to break this case.
- This wasn't my call.

21:50.844 --> 21:52.579
And now the Russians are onto us.

21:52.580 --> 21:55.014
Carpenter will be onto us, too.

21:55.015 --> 21:58.685
Unless we grab up Magda now,
as quietly as possible.

21:58.686 --> 22:01.454
What do you think, Beau?
Do we have the votes?

22:01.455 --> 22:03.656
It'll be a squeaker,

22:03.657 --> 22:06.726
but you'll get your treaty,
Mr. President.

22:06.727 --> 22:08.428
ELIZABETH: Great.
And I hope you'll attend

22:08.429 --> 22:09.562
the signing ceremony.

22:09.563 --> 22:10.964
It'll be low-key.

22:10.965 --> 22:13.299
With a vote this close, there's
always a chance it won't pass,

22:13.300 --> 22:15.234
and I don't want to
have a bunch of cameras

22:15.235 --> 22:17.170
recording me falling on my face.

22:17.171 --> 22:19.205
- Understood?
- RUSSELL: Yes, sir.

22:19.206 --> 22:20.406
I'll set it up.

22:20.407 --> 22:21.674
Beau.

22:21.675 --> 22:23.942
Mr. President.

22:33.486 --> 22:34.787
Everything,

22:34.788 --> 22:36.522
uh, all right there, Senator?

22:36.523 --> 22:37.724
Where to start?

22:37.725 --> 22:40.326
The cold makes my knees ache.

22:40.327 --> 22:44.263
And now I've got a stack
of briefing books

22:44.264 --> 22:46.265
to read that are taller than I am.

22:46.266 --> 22:48.568
(LAUGHTER)

22:48.569 --> 22:51.137
And, uh, my cleaning woman called in

22:51.138 --> 22:52.372
sick this morning.

22:52.373 --> 22:53.873
Very unusual.

22:53.874 --> 22:57.010
Apologies. At my age,

22:57.011 --> 23:00.647
the smallest inconveniences
give a person fits. (LAUGHS)

23:00.648 --> 23:02.248
Well, then,

23:02.249 --> 23:03.883
I must be mature beyond my years.

23:03.884 --> 23:06.252
(LAUGHTER)

23:06.253 --> 23:08.087
I'm looking forward to visiting

23:08.088 --> 23:10.773
with you and your
husband at your party.

23:10.774 --> 23:12.792
Well, we look forward
to seeing you there.

23:12.793 --> 23:13.960
Well, in that case,

23:13.961 --> 23:15.995
I'll say good-bye to you both.

23:15.996 --> 23:18.296
Thank you.

23:19.065 --> 23:20.600
Come on. What's next?

23:20.601 --> 23:22.435
You think he knows something's up?

23:22.436 --> 23:24.303
Not yet.

23:24.304 --> 23:25.872
Okay.

23:25.873 --> 23:28.241
We had to loop in Carpenter's
Capitol Police detail,

23:28.242 --> 23:31.177
not to mention that snake Morejon.

23:31.178 --> 23:33.746
OpSec is hanging on by a thread here.

23:33.747 --> 23:37.116
But if by some miracle,
we do actually bust him,

23:37.117 --> 23:40.653
I remind you, Carpenter
is your 67th vote.

23:40.654 --> 23:46.124
If he gets arrested,
where'll your treaty be then?

23:49.095 --> 23:51.397
Look, Magda, we know
you're not telling us the truth.

23:51.398 --> 23:53.833
And you're not getting
out of here until you do.

23:53.834 --> 23:55.301
So start talking.

23:55.302 --> 23:56.936
Yes, okay.

23:56.937 --> 23:58.604
I passed messages from the senator

23:58.605 --> 24:00.673
to the man that you say is Russian.

24:00.674 --> 24:03.176
Sometimes the other way, too.

24:03.177 --> 24:04.444
But I don't know him.

24:04.445 --> 24:07.346
I don't know what the messages mean.

24:07.347 --> 24:09.649
They're usually just two
or three words.

24:09.650 --> 24:11.250
I just pass them along.

24:11.251 --> 24:13.386
Because you're a Russian asset.

24:13.387 --> 24:16.089
You obviously don't know the
history of Russia and Hungary.

24:16.090 --> 24:17.657
Then why are you passing

24:17.658 --> 24:20.325
classified intelligence
to the Russians?

24:22.695 --> 24:26.132
He helped my daughter
to get into a good school.

24:26.133 --> 24:27.967
He paid me for all the time

24:27.968 --> 24:30.236
I took off when my mother got sick.

24:30.237 --> 24:32.504
He's a good man.

24:33.172 --> 24:35.007
NOLAN: What do you think?

24:35.008 --> 24:36.022
I believe her.

24:36.023 --> 24:37.710
Me, too. So now what?

24:37.711 --> 24:39.779
Well, we've got enough to charge her,

24:39.780 --> 24:41.981
but still not much
of a case against Carpenter.

24:41.982 --> 24:44.183
All he'd need to do is
deny sending her messages,

24:44.184 --> 24:45.536
and then it's his word against hers.

24:45.537 --> 24:46.860
The longer Carpenter
doesn't hear from her,

24:46.861 --> 24:48.026
the more suspicious he'll be.

24:48.027 --> 24:50.469
And once he gets wind of the
investigation and lawyers up,

24:50.470 --> 24:52.037
this case gets much harder to prove.

24:52.038 --> 24:54.139
Look, we have enough PC for a warrant,

24:54.140 --> 24:56.742
but a high-profile raid on the
Senate majority leader's house?

24:56.743 --> 24:58.544
You better know what you're gonna find

24:58.545 --> 24:59.912
before you go in there.

24:59.913 --> 25:02.114
This is counterintelligence,
so we do have some latitude

25:02.115 --> 25:04.349
for a secret search.
What we don't have is time.

25:04.350 --> 25:06.617
Wait. The party.

25:07.586 --> 25:10.155
He's coming to my wife's
holiday party tonight.

25:10.156 --> 25:12.456
We can hit the house then.

25:19.563 --> 25:22.708
So, uh, given the time and...

25:22.709 --> 25:25.077
financial constraints, here's my plan.

25:25.078 --> 25:26.779
First, food.

25:26.780 --> 25:29.782
Uh, my friend Javi owns one of
the hottest food trucks in town,

25:29.783 --> 25:31.350
so he is going to be doing

25:31.351 --> 25:33.952
passed appetizers and three
different taco preparations.

25:33.953 --> 25:35.099
Please enjoy.

25:35.100 --> 25:36.750
Ma'am, I got to say,
these tacos are legit.

25:36.751 --> 25:40.053
Right? Drinks-wise, we've got
a couple wines and beers,

25:40.054 --> 25:42.989
champagne and one signature cocktail.

25:42.990 --> 25:44.591
It is a Mexican twist

25:44.592 --> 25:46.693
on a traditional holiday punch.

25:46.694 --> 25:48.228
- (MOUTH FULL): Can we try that, too?
- I wish.

25:48.229 --> 25:50.296
Entertainment will be provided

25:50.297 --> 25:53.266
by the amazing Seventh Floor Singers.

25:53.267 --> 25:54.801
(CLEARS THROAT)

25:54.802 --> 25:58.604
And in accordance
with federal ethics guidelines,

25:58.605 --> 26:00.667
they will be there only as guests,

26:00.668 --> 26:03.162
so they can perform as few
or as many songs as they like.

26:03.163 --> 26:05.565
More than karaoke, less than a concert.

26:05.566 --> 26:06.966
- Thank God.
- Here

26:06.967 --> 26:10.002
is the finalized guest list per
The White House and Mike B.

26:10.003 --> 26:11.939
- What? No POTUS and FLOTUS?
- They don't want to take up

26:11.940 --> 26:12.803
all the oxygen.

26:12.804 --> 26:15.705
Also, notice the names
Jacob and Natalie Barker.

26:15.706 --> 26:18.808
Those are the bigwigs
I'm supposed to suck up to?

26:18.809 --> 26:20.310
Or just feign interest in
for 15 minutes.

26:20.311 --> 26:21.477
What about the five

26:21.478 --> 26:23.479
senators I'm trying to win over,

26:23.480 --> 26:26.049
and... and the-the family
from the video?

26:26.050 --> 26:27.183
Already RSVP'd.

26:27.184 --> 26:28.685
Oh.

26:28.686 --> 26:30.086
Oh, no.

26:30.087 --> 26:31.321
No, no.

26:31.322 --> 26:32.689
Carlos Morejon?

26:32.690 --> 26:34.057
MATT: And his wife Vicki,

26:34.058 --> 26:35.758

36:11.748 --> 36:13.649
on the land mines treaty.

36:13.650 --> 36:15.785
- Oh.
- I could use yours.

36:15.786 --> 36:18.020
That's why you had
the couple from that video

36:18.021 --> 36:19.588
in my wife's ear all night.

36:19.589 --> 36:21.257
- (LAUGHS)
- Clever.

36:21.258 --> 36:22.907
But it's not gonna work.

36:22.908 --> 36:27.311
Look, protecting American
sovereignty and safety,

36:27.312 --> 36:29.980
that's why I take the tough votes.

36:29.981 --> 36:32.917
Carlos, everyone already
knows you're tough.

36:32.918 --> 36:36.230
What the voters don't
know is whether or not

36:36.231 --> 36:38.166
you've got a soul.

36:38.167 --> 36:40.568
If you buck

36:40.569 --> 36:42.770
your more extreme colleagues now,

36:42.771 --> 36:46.674
no one will care by the time
the primaries roll around.

36:46.675 --> 36:48.976
But those suburban moms in...

36:48.977 --> 36:51.279
St. Louis and Tampa,

36:51.280 --> 36:53.714
they will still remember the video

36:53.715 --> 36:56.350
of that little girl in the minefield,

36:56.351 --> 36:58.820
and they will respect that you

36:58.821 --> 37:02.557
had the guts to stand up and cast

37:02.558 --> 37:05.293
the decisive vote for what's right.

37:05.294 --> 37:08.963
("Have Yourself a Merry
Little Christmas" continues)

37:08.964 --> 37:12.733
(QUIETLY):
Well, something to think about.

37:12.734 --> 37:16.804
♪ A merry little Christmas... ♪

37:16.805 --> 37:20.474
I want to thank you for
having us, Madam Secretary.

37:20.475 --> 37:23.544
Thanks for coming, Senator.

37:23.545 --> 37:25.745
(SONG ENDS, SCATTERED APPLAUSE)

37:28.282 --> 37:31.452
Please tell me that you're
not friends with him now.

37:31.453 --> 37:32.753
No.

37:32.754 --> 37:36.390
But he is more complex than I thought.

37:36.391 --> 37:37.692
(SCOFFS SOFTLY)

37:37.693 --> 37:41.229
Hey, if you can find the
humanity in <i>that</i> guy,

37:41.230 --> 37:43.130
you got my vote.

37:43.131 --> 37:44.732
Well, that's very sweet of you.

37:44.733 --> 37:48.002
I'm not sure Russell and Mike B.
would give my performance

37:48.003 --> 37:50.004
such a high rating.

37:50.005 --> 37:52.206
So what? I see the way

37:52.207 --> 37:54.942
Dalton carries himself,
the way people react to him.

37:54.943 --> 37:58.345
I saw the same thing tonight.

37:59.080 --> 38:00.848
I saw a president.

38:00.849 --> 38:05.419
But also kind of a pain
in the ass, right?

38:05.420 --> 38:07.188
I'm being serious.

38:07.189 --> 38:09.990
Then I'm gonna be serious, too.

38:11.359 --> 38:13.294
Stevie...

38:13.295 --> 38:16.864
you did amazing work

38:16.865 --> 38:19.032
with this party.

38:20.067 --> 38:22.469
With me.

38:23.237 --> 38:24.338
Thank you...

38:24.339 --> 38:26.574
(WHISPERS): and I'm sorry.

38:26.575 --> 38:28.809
You're welcome.

38:28.810 --> 38:31.745
(PHONE CHIMES)

38:34.181 --> 38:37.751
Got to go check something
with Javi before he takes off.

38:40.221 --> 38:42.522
Hardworkin' girl.

38:47.061 --> 38:48.496
Hi.

38:48.497 --> 38:50.865
Hey.

38:50.866 --> 38:53.299
How was your party?

38:54.669 --> 38:56.636
Good.

38:57.371 --> 38:59.273
So you were just...

38:59.274 --> 39:02.610
out for a random late-night run?

39:02.611 --> 39:04.946
Hmm. Something like that.

39:04.947 --> 39:06.280
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

39:06.281 --> 39:09.283
I really just wanted
to see you all dressed up.

39:09.284 --> 39:10.885
Oh...

39:10.886 --> 39:12.452
Okay.

39:13.187 --> 39:14.722
Here it is.

39:14.723 --> 39:17.858
- Want to see the whole thing?
- Uh... yeah, I do.

39:17.859 --> 39:19.827
(BOTH LAUGH)

39:19.828 --> 39:20.995
Well?

39:20.996 --> 39:22.196
Well?

39:22.197 --> 39:24.131
Well...

39:24.132 --> 39:26.833
you already know what I think.

39:31.939 --> 39:34.942
- MAN: Car's all set, Congressman.
- Thank you.

39:34.943 --> 39:38.645
Well, I have to go. Uh...

39:39.380 --> 39:41.681
Okay.

39:43.617 --> 39:45.185
(LAUGHS)

39:46.954 --> 39:48.589
Hey, you should have,

39:48.590 --> 39:49.957
um...

39:49.958 --> 39:53.094
you should have said,
"I got to run," 'cause the...

39:53.095 --> 39:55.495
Oh. 'Cause... Yeah.

39:56.530 --> 39:58.264
- (LAUGHS)
- All right.

40:06.173 --> 40:08.009
So your son says, "Dad, I screwed up.

40:08.010 --> 40:10.111
"I'm looking at bankruptcy,
maybe even prison.

40:10.112 --> 40:11.479
"But these Russian bankers

40:11.480 --> 40:13.347
have offered to bail me out."

40:13.348 --> 40:15.282
And you want to help,
so you take the money,

40:15.283 --> 40:16.650
pass it through shell corporations,

40:16.651 --> 40:18.786
then give it to him so it
looks like a family loan...

40:18.787 --> 40:19.954
- is that accurate?
- Don't answer that,

40:19.955 --> 40:21.055
Senator.

40:21.056 --> 40:22.556
AGENT: It'd be better
for him if he does.

40:22.557 --> 40:24.492
- We already have the documents.
- Obtained through

40:24.493 --> 40:26.360
- a highly questionable search, which...
- (DOOR BUZZES)

40:26.361 --> 40:28.396
- Who the hell is this?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

40:28.397 --> 40:29.897
Was it worth it?

40:29.898 --> 40:33.134
I'm not generally in the
habit of making confessions

40:33.135 --> 40:34.735
to the CIA!

40:34.736 --> 40:36.237
Wait a minute, this guy is CIA?

40:36.238 --> 40:37.505
Was it worth it?

40:37.506 --> 40:40.474
I sent courageous, dedicated
Americans into the field,

40:40.475 --> 40:41.709
and they trusted us.

40:41.710 --> 40:44.345
They trusted you to have
their backs, and you...

40:44.346 --> 40:45.780
betrayed them.

40:45.781 --> 40:48.416
So you could keep your
son out of a Club Fed

40:48.417 --> 40:49.850
for a couple of years?

40:49.851 --> 40:52.253
What about their families?

40:52.254 --> 40:54.655
Those families won't
even know how they died.

40:54.656 --> 40:56.624
I can barely live with it.

40:56.625 --> 40:58.426
- How can you?
- That's enough.

40:58.427 --> 41:00.361
It's a very simple question, Senator.

41:00.362 --> 41:02.829
Was it worth it?

41:07.001 --> 41:09.804
What have I done?

41:09.805 --> 41:11.539
Sweet...

41:11.540 --> 41:13.506
Jesus.

41:14.842 --> 41:17.244
What have I done?

41:17.245 --> 41:19.213
This is all inadmissible.

41:19.214 --> 41:22.081
It's... it's over, Carl.

41:24.752 --> 41:26.620
It's over.

41:26.621 --> 41:28.289
DALTON: <i>With today's vote,</i>

41:28.290 --> 41:32.660
the Senate has officially
ratified the Calgary Treaty,

41:32.661 --> 41:35.162
and the United States has
finally assumed the mantle

41:35.163 --> 41:36.730
of moral leadership

41:36.731 --> 41:39.300
to eradicate the scourge of land mines

41:39.301 --> 41:40.468
from this Earth.

41:40.469 --> 41:41.669
I'm heartened

41:41.670 --> 41:43.404
that President Li of China,

41:43.405 --> 41:46.674
one of the world's largest producers

41:46.675 --> 41:49.610
of antipersonnel land mines,
has also agreed to take

41:49.611 --> 41:50.945
this crucial step.

41:50.946 --> 41:53.914
This is indeed a proud moment,

41:53.915 --> 41:57.685
not just for the United States,
but for the world.

41:57.686 --> 41:59.519
Thank you.

42:03.324 --> 42:05.558
(APPLAUSE CONTINUES)

42:07.661 --> 42:09.130
Big day.

42:09.131 --> 42:11.065
Too bad no one's watching,

42:11.066 --> 42:13.567
- with all this Beau Carpenter business.
- Yeah.

42:13.568 --> 42:15.903
And Morejon was the swing vote.

42:15.904 --> 42:17.505
I still don't know
how you pulled it off,

42:17.506 --> 42:18.706
but I'm impressed.

42:18.707 --> 42:20.174
And so are the Barkers.

42:20.175 --> 42:21.876
Well...

42:21.877 --> 42:23.511
good for them.

42:23.512 --> 42:25.779
I thought you'd be pleased.

42:25.780 --> 42:30.484
Russell, I told you
I don't care about that.

42:30.485 --> 42:33.020
Russia just pulled off the
highest-level infiltration

42:33.021 --> 42:36.590
of our government in our history.

42:36.591 --> 42:39.226
And I intend to do
everything in my power

42:39.227 --> 42:41.027
to hold them accountable.
