WEBVTT

00:06.270 --> 00:08.591
Looks like
a standard car alarm.

00:10.210 --> 00:12.201
Then go ahead
and disarm it.

00:14.440 --> 00:15.702
ODIN (deep male voice):
You have approached Odin.

00:15.740 --> 00:17.469
Your photograph has been taken

00:17.510 --> 00:19.239
and forwarded
to the authorities.

00:19.280 --> 00:21.646
You have ten seconds
to back away.

00:21.680 --> 00:22.715
Ten.

00:22.750 --> 00:24.149
Nine.

00:24.190 --> 00:25.418
Eight...

00:25.450 --> 00:27.315
It's a talking
car alarm.

00:27.360 --> 00:30.158
They are the pet rock
of automotive security;

00:30.190 --> 00:31.418
they are a gimmick.

00:31.460 --> 00:32.688
They were a gimmick.

00:32.730 --> 00:35.290
I can't crack it.

00:47.610 --> 00:50.147
You have approached Odin.

00:50.180 --> 00:51.602
Your photograph has been taken

00:51.650 --> 00:53.072
and forwarded to the author--

00:55.150 --> 00:57.789
The sensor's field extends
a full 360 degrees?

00:59.460 --> 01:01.212
Well, it's
an interesting problem.

01:01.260 --> 01:03.387
I appreciate the help.

01:03.430 --> 01:04.727
I'll leave it here.

01:04.760 --> 01:05.829
We gotta go.

01:05.860 --> 01:07.225
Meeting starts in 20.

01:07.260 --> 01:09.694
Doing battle with Odin

01:09.730 --> 01:12.699
seems like a more stimulating
way to spend an hour to me.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.093
I'm not skipping
a meeting.

01:14.140 --> 01:16.563
I don't think
you should, either.

01:16.610 --> 01:17.759
What's going on with you?

01:17.810 --> 01:19.402
Been bailing on meetings

01:19.440 --> 01:20.839
and then when you do show,
you never talk.

01:20.880 --> 01:22.677
Your enthusiasm
for the program

01:22.710 --> 01:24.371
never waxes and wanes?

01:24.410 --> 01:26.173
Sure it does.
But I still go.

01:26.220 --> 01:28.074
(doorbell rings)

01:30.420 --> 01:32.217
My name's Shauna Milius.

01:32.260 --> 01:33.750
I used to work with Joan Watson.

01:33.790 --> 01:35.212
This is her address, right?

01:35.260 --> 01:37.751
It was. She no longer
lives here, sorry.

01:37.790 --> 01:39.189
Can you tell me where she went?

01:39.230 --> 01:40.390
I want to hire her.

01:40.430 --> 01:41.692
One second.

01:41.730 --> 01:43.527
Duty calls, Alfredo.

01:43.570 --> 01:44.821
I'll let you know
when I've defeated Odin.

01:44.870 --> 01:46.394
ALFREDO:
About that...

01:46.440 --> 01:48.237
While I was waiting
for you downstairs,

01:48.270 --> 01:50.534
I stashed a few of the sensors
around the place.

01:50.570 --> 01:52.401
Just to keep the problem
fresh in your mind.

01:54.310 --> 01:57.245
Excuse me.

02:00.350 --> 02:03.581
It's my friend,
Marissa Ledbetter.

02:03.620 --> 02:05.315
We started as O.R. nurses
on the same day.

02:05.350 --> 02:07.181
We've been
close srnce.

02:07.220 --> 02:09.188
Last week,
she finished up a shift

02:09.230 --> 02:10.822
and told me she was headed home.

02:10.860 --> 02:13.328
None of her neighbors
saw her come into the building.

02:13.360 --> 02:14.657
Nobody's seen her since.

02:14.700 --> 02:16.827
I'm sorry.
Marissa's parents

02:16.870 --> 02:19.259
are down in Florida. They're not
well enough to travel,

02:19.300 --> 02:22.201
so I've kind of been
keeping track of things.

02:22.240 --> 02:24.663
You made some notes
based on your conversations

02:24.710 --> 02:26.598
with the detectives?
May I?

02:33.550 --> 02:35.177
It says here
she used her credit card

02:35.220 --> 02:37.313
at a bodega on West 44th Street

02:37.350 --> 02:39.511
shortly after leaving hospital.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.209
Where does Marissa live?

02:41.260 --> 02:42.352
Cobble Hill.

02:42.390 --> 02:43.755
Right.
And you and her work

02:43.790 --> 02:46.258
at Watson's old hospital
in the West Village. Yes?

02:47.400 --> 02:48.856
Hell's Kitchen is hardly
on the way home

02:48.900 --> 02:50.322
from the West Village
to Brooklyn.

02:50.370 --> 02:52.338
Is anyone looking into this?

02:52.370 --> 02:54.691
They think maybe Marissa
owed money to some bad people.

02:54.740 --> 02:56.537
They were pretty
fixated on that.

02:56.570 --> 02:59.368
Money-lenders to not want their
indigent clients to disappear;

02:59.410 --> 03:01.230
they want them to work
and make money.

03:01.280 --> 03:04.272
It's a game of chance,
going to the police,

03:04.310 --> 03:06.278
but you're in
good hands now.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.242
ODIN:
You have approached Odin.

03:08.280 --> 03:09.349
Your photograph has been taken

03:09.390 --> 03:11.312
and forwarded...
Disregard this.

03:11.350 --> 03:12.612
...to the authorities.
I'm doing a favor
for a friend.

03:12.660 --> 03:14.412
You have ten seconds
to back away.

03:14.460 --> 03:16.348
So someone I used
to work With IS mIssmg,

03:16.390 --> 03:17.425
another old
colleague friend

03:17.460 --> 03:19.325
tries to hire me
to look into it,

03:19.360 --> 03:22.227
and somehow, Sherlock
winds up on the case.

03:22.270 --> 03:24.921
He just sort of
slipped into it.

03:24.970 --> 03:26.790
I think he did it
mostly to get out of

03:26.840 --> 03:28.296
going to a meeting
with Alfredo.

03:28.340 --> 03:30.399
He wants us to catch up
on the case file

03:30.440 --> 03:31.930
while he looks
into something.

03:31.970 --> 03:34.609
I've circled something
on the first page.

03:34.640 --> 03:38.371
Looks like Marissa received
a payment of $150,000

03:38.410 --> 03:40.014
right before she disappeared.

03:40.050 --> 03:41.278
What is "Purgatorium,
Incorporated"?

03:41.320 --> 03:43.345
It's a company

03:43.390 --> 03:45.950
based in Luxembourg,
founded a month ago.

03:45.990 --> 03:47.787
There's no information
about them anywhere.

03:47.820 --> 03:49.822
Luxembourg's a tax haven,
apparently,

03:49.860 --> 03:51.282
so the police
can't find out

03:51.330 --> 03:54.254
anything about the people
that founded it.

03:54.300 --> 03:55.528
Well, you said
on the phone

03:55.560 --> 03:57.391
that Marissa had debts,

03:57.430 --> 03:59.261
but this is hardly
the same thing

03:59.300 --> 04:00.562
as a payday loan joint.

04:00.600 --> 04:02.329
What did Sherlock
say about it?

04:02.370 --> 04:04.429
(phone chimes)
He doesn't know
about it yet.

04:04.470 --> 04:06.870
He's looking into
the last place that she
used her credit card.

04:06.910 --> 04:08.468
It's Sherlock.

04:08.510 --> 04:10.398
WATSON: What does he say?

04:10.450 --> 04:11.599
I don't know.

04:11.650 --> 04:13.447
These abbreviations
that he uses...

04:13.480 --> 04:15.744
"At 748 West 45th Street.

04:15.780 --> 04:16.986
"In rear. Bring Watson.

04:17.020 --> 04:17.918
Wear sensible shoes."

04:20.590 --> 04:22.581
WATSON: So why did you
want us to meet you

04:22.630 --> 04:24.450
in the allewNay
behind a bar?

04:24.490 --> 04:26.458
Not just any bar.

04:26.500 --> 04:27.922
This Dumpster
services Vladi's.

04:27.960 --> 04:29.928
It's the kind
of establishment which,

04:29.970 --> 04:32.291
despite the rapidly gentrifying
neighborhood around it,

04:32.340 --> 04:33.762
still manages to attract

04:33.800 --> 04:35.768
a thoroughly
seedy clientele.

04:35.800 --> 04:37.904
Pins in this padlock

04:37.940 --> 04:40.636
were too heaw
for my lock picks, so...

04:46.820 --> 04:48.310
I'm not getting in there

04:48.350 --> 04:50.818
until you tell me what
it is I'm looking for.

04:52.460 --> 04:54.451
_ When I was
Investigating the, uh...

04:54.490 --> 04:56.481
the area around the bodega

04:56.530 --> 04:59.328
where Marissa Ledbetter
last used her credit card,

04:59.360 --> 05:02.466
I couldn't help noticing
that this place

05:02.500 --> 05:04.491
is subject to

05:04.530 --> 05:06.395
a litany of complaints

05:06.440 --> 05:07.429
from the neighbors.

05:07.470 --> 05:08.835
Noise complaints,

05:08.870 --> 05:11.031
public urination,
that kind of thing.

05:11.070 --> 05:12.469
(clears throat)

05:12.510 --> 05:14.478
One stood out.

05:14.510 --> 05:17.047
A couple of days ago, two
businesses complained of a f...

05:17.080 --> 05:18.445
Oof.

05:18.480 --> 05:19.947
...a foul smell

05:19.980 --> 05:21.572
coming from
this Dumpster.

05:21.620 --> 05:22.882
It does smell awful,

05:22.920 --> 05:24.615
but isn't it supposed
to smell awful?

05:24.650 --> 05:26.459
Yeah.

05:26.490 --> 05:29.425
It's rancid... ugh!

05:34.160 --> 05:35.422
(groans)

05:37.170 --> 05:38.660
I'm sorry, Watson.

06:04.760 --> 06:06.694
BELL:
So you found this on her body?

06:06.730 --> 06:08.129
It's a list of dosages.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.798
Marissa was a nurse.

06:09.830 --> 06:11.127
It doesn't look like

06:11.170 --> 06:12.660
an official hospital
communication.

06:12.700 --> 06:13.667
I've sent Kitty to St. Andrew's

06:13.700 --> 06:14.962
with a photograph of that.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.558
I'm curious as to whether it has

06:16.610 --> 06:18.828
anything to do
with her work there.

06:18.870 --> 06:20.132
You all right, Watson?

06:21.740 --> 06:23.002
acquainted with Ms. Ledbetter.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.507
Well, I hadn't seen her
in a long time,

06:25.550 --> 06:27.177
but she was a really
sweet person.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.745
We're all done.

06:31.050 --> 06:33.587
Your friend died shortly
after she went missing.

06:33.620 --> 06:35.679
She was, uh, struck in the head
about a dozen times,

06:35.720 --> 06:37.859
before someone wrapped
their hands around her neck

06:37.890 --> 06:39.596
and squeezed.

06:41.230 --> 06:42.697
I'm sorry.

06:42.730 --> 06:45.597
Was there any evidence
on the body?

06:45.630 --> 06:47.564
She had someone else's DNA
under her fingernails.

06:47.600 --> 06:48.692
She must have
scratched her attacker,

06:48.740 --> 06:49.934
trying to fight him off.

06:49.970 --> 06:51.198
I had someone at the lab run

06:51.240 --> 06:52.639
a preliminary check on the DNA.

06:52.680 --> 06:54.204
It matches a sample someone left

06:54.240 --> 06:55.901
when they applied for a job
at the DA's Office.

06:55.940 --> 06:58.943
Guy's name is
Christopher Jacoby.

07:00.480 --> 07:03.608
So, we have
the probable killer's name

07:03.650 --> 07:05.083
and his DNA.

07:05.120 --> 07:06.712
He has a current address
on file, too.

07:08.490 --> 07:10.026
Watson, if you like, I could...

07:10.060 --> 07:11.652
give your friend the bad news.

07:11.690 --> 07:14.454
Oh, I'll do it. Thanks.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.627
Detective Bell, let us know when
you have the killer in custody.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.126
Yeah, hold on.
I'm, uh...

07:18.170 --> 07:19.865
checking something on
the department intranet.

07:19.900 --> 07:22.801
Jacoby... Jacoby...

07:22.840 --> 07:24.205
I knew I recognized that name.

07:24.240 --> 07:26.629
It keeps coming up
in our briefings.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.500
He's missing, too.

07:28.540 --> 07:29.643
His wife filed a report

07:29.680 --> 07:31.773
last Wednesday.

07:32.980 --> 07:35.517
I'm sorry.

07:35.550 --> 07:37.780
You're saying Chris is
a suspect in a murder?

07:37.820 --> 07:39.879
Well, his DNA was found

07:39.920 --> 07:41.512
under the fingernails
of the victim.

07:41.560 --> 07:43.721
It looks like it happened
around the same time

07:43.760 --> 07:44.988
your husband
went missing.

07:45.030 --> 07:47.498
There has to be a mistake.

07:47.530 --> 07:48.451
Chris is a kind man.

07:48.500 --> 07:51.992
Did he know a woman
named Marissa Ledbetter?

07:52.030 --> 07:53.998
Not that he mentioned.

07:54.040 --> 07:55.667
BELL: Well, according
to the report

07:55.700 --> 07:57.236
you filed,
the last time you saw Chris,

07:57.270 --> 07:59.704
he told you he was going to
spend a couple nights upstate

07:59.740 --> 08:01.776
with some college buddies,
but his friends say

08:01.810 --> 08:03.277
they didn't have any plans
with your husband.

08:03.310 --> 08:05.505
Well, I don't know why Chris
lied about that,

08:05.550 --> 08:08.917
but he wouldn't cheat on me,
if that's what you're wondering.

08:08.950 --> 08:10.838
Chris is a good man.

08:10.890 --> 08:12.812
We've been struggling
since he got laid off,

08:12.860 --> 08:13.884
but we're
dealing with it.

08:13.920 --> 08:17.583
Something happened to him.

08:17.630 --> 08:18.927
He wouldn't run away
from our life,

08:18.960 --> 08:20.154
and he definitely
wouldn't kill someone.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.622
(knocking at door)

08:21.660 --> 08:23.992
Uh, sorry to interrupt.

08:25.870 --> 08:28.634
Did you bring a child
to work with you today?

08:28.670 --> 08:30.729
Oh, no, that's Mason.

08:30.770 --> 08:32.067
He's older
than he looks.

08:32.110 --> 08:33.304
A bit.

08:33.340 --> 08:34.739
He passed a note to me.

08:34.780 --> 08:36.133
Said to give it to you.

08:36.180 --> 08:38.000
Said it was urgent.

08:43.890 --> 08:45.983
Okay, first of all,
I don't mean to be rude,

08:46.020 --> 08:47.612
but your computers suck.

08:47.660 --> 08:48.752
HOLMES:
You said you found

08:48.790 --> 08:50.849
Chris Jacoby.
MASON:
I think so.

08:50.890 --> 08:52.323
I compared his picture
to the cached images

08:52.360 --> 08:54.157
from surveillance cameras
all around the City.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.656
There was a match
from yesterday,

08:55.700 --> 08:56.792
right by Morningside Park.

08:56.830 --> 08:58.320
It's weird, though.

08:58.370 --> 09:00.099
You gave me a picture

09:00.140 --> 09:02.700
of a clean-cut guy.

09:02.740 --> 09:04.560
The match I found was...

09:04.610 --> 09:06.032
something else.

09:07.810 --> 09:09.334
That's Chris Jacoby?

09:09.380 --> 09:10.802
MASON :
Software says

09:10.850 --> 09:11.942
it's a perfect match.

09:11.980 --> 09:13.743
WATSON:
So how often are you here?

09:13.780 --> 09:15.919
WOMAN:
I play here every day.

09:15.950 --> 09:17.611
I have a permit from the city

09:17.650 --> 09:19.618
that covers the entrance
to the park.

09:19.660 --> 09:21.082
Would it be fair to say

09:21.120 --> 09:23.827
you're familiar with
the local homeless population?

09:23.860 --> 09:26.795
You get to know the faces.

09:26.830 --> 09:28.923
Do you recognize this man?

09:28.960 --> 09:30.769
WOMAN:
Him, I know for sure.

09:30.800 --> 09:33.268
He's come up to talk to me

09:33.300 --> 09:35.063
a few times this week.

09:35.100 --> 09:38.103
He seems quite damaged.

09:38.140 --> 09:39.801
So you've seen him
more than once?

09:39.840 --> 09:40.807
I've seen him coming out

09:40.840 --> 09:42.068
from the park in the morning.

09:42.110 --> 09:43.941
I get the impression

09:43.980 --> 09:46.301
that he's sleeping nearby.

09:48.320 --> 09:49.947
So how are you doing?

09:49.990 --> 09:52.652
I beg your pardon?

09:52.690 --> 09:54.282
How are you?

09:54.320 --> 09:56.288
Well, my heart rate
is normal for a man my age

09:56.320 --> 09:57.787
and my blood pressure
is good to excellent,

09:57.830 --> 09:59.650
last time I checked.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.691
You know better than to ask me
such a non-speCIfic question.

10:01.730 --> 10:02.924
What are you getting at?

10:02.970 --> 10:04.289
Well, Kitty said you
ducked out of a meeting

10:04.330 --> 10:05.866
this morning.

10:05.900 --> 10:07.162
And I know that
you were upset

10:07.200 --> 10:09.134
because that guy posted
your shares on his blog.

10:09.170 --> 10:11.161
Firstly, I didn't
"duck out" of anything.

10:11.210 --> 10:12.837
I took a case.

10:12.880 --> 10:15.098
And secondly,
I've come to believe

10:15.140 --> 10:17.279
that the recent _violation
of my anonymity was,

10:17.310 --> 10:18.846
on balance,
a good thing.

10:18.880 --> 10:20.814
Good? How?

10:20.850 --> 10:23.148
Well, it's given me some
distance from the program.

10:23.190 --> 10:25.681
A chance to _evaluate which
aspects of it work for me

10:25.720 --> 10:27.859
and which don't.

10:27.890 --> 10:29.824
I don't think
it's really

10:29.860 --> 10:31.657
an la carte kind
of arrangement.

10:31.690 --> 10:32.998
Yes, it is.

10:33.030 --> 10:36.864
At any rate, all systems
can be improved upon, Watson.

10:36.900 --> 10:38.026
What is it?

10:38.070 --> 10:40.368
Looks like a good spot
for an encampment.

11:00.060 --> 11:02.187
WATSON:
Sherlock!

11:07.260 --> 11:08.898
Hello?

11:08.930 --> 11:10.898
Mr. Jacoby?

11:19.010 --> 11:19.908
(sighs heavily)

11:21.840 --> 11:22.909
I'll text Marcus.

11:29.250 --> 11:31.480
Hold on.

11:31.520 --> 11:34.956
This earth's been disturbed.

11:48.440 --> 11:49.759
What is it?

11:49.810 --> 11:50.902
Well, it seems Mr. Jacoby

11:50.940 --> 11:52.931
has kept a journal.

11:52.980 --> 11:56.006
And he considered its contents
important enough to keep hidden.

11:58.950 --> 12:00.838
"The room never changed.

12:00.880 --> 12:03.747
"Day after day,
year after year,

12:03.790 --> 12:06.759
"decade after decade.

12:06.790 --> 12:09.509
"I went insane
a dozen different times.

12:09.560 --> 12:12.927
"Then I became convinced I died

12:12.960 --> 12:14.052
and went to Hell.

12:14.100 --> 12:15.192
"I thought no one would ever

12:15.230 --> 12:17.892
"come for me until the morning
the woman came for me.

12:17.930 --> 12:19.363
I was ready to strike."

12:19.400 --> 12:22.039
He's describing the murder
of Marissa Ledbetter.

12:22.070 --> 12:25.904
Maybe the version of it
that existed in his head.

12:25.940 --> 12:29.068
So, we found
Marissa Ledbetter's killer,

12:29.110 --> 12:31.101
who's dead.

12:31.150 --> 12:33.072
So, now what are
we investigating?

12:33.120 --> 12:34.917
Chris Jacoby's murder?

12:34.950 --> 12:38.044
We know who did what to whom.

12:38.090 --> 12:41.116
The why of the matter
escapes me utterly.

12:42.830 --> 12:44.422
A man lies to his wife

12:44.460 --> 12:45.950
about a trip upstate.

12:45.990 --> 12:47.992
Within days,
he's driven to utter madness.

12:48.030 --> 12:50.419
His victim received a mysterious
and untraceable payment

12:50.470 --> 12:52.961
to her bank account.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.467
We don't know what
Chris Jacoby was really

12:54.500 --> 12:56.297
up to the day
he disappeared,

12:56.340 --> 12:58.262
just as we don't know what
Marissa Ledbetter was doing

12:58.310 --> 13:00.107
in Hell's Kitchen.
And we don't know how they met

13:00.140 --> 13:01.971
or where he killed her.

13:03.180 --> 13:04.841
(computer buzzes)

13:04.880 --> 13:05.904
Hmm!

13:05.950 --> 13:07.144
What is it?

13:07.180 --> 13:09.011
This is Chris Jacoby's laptop.

13:09.050 --> 13:10.847
His wife lent it to me.

13:10.890 --> 13:13.154
I'd been poking around and
I found a number of e-mails,

13:13.190 --> 13:14.487
which suggested
that he'd opened a new

13:14.520 --> 13:17.921
bank account shortly
before his disappearance.

13:17.960 --> 13:19.222
She didn't know
anything about it.

13:19.260 --> 13:21.125
I'd been guessing
at his password and...

13:21.160 --> 13:22.559
voila.

13:22.600 --> 13:24.124
"Purgatorium."
That's the same company

13:24.170 --> 13:26.195
that put money
into Ledbetter's account.

13:26.230 --> 13:27.834
Why'd they both receive payments

13:27.870 --> 13:30.236
for $150,000 in
the same week?

13:30.270 --> 13:31.532
The slip of paper
we found on her

13:31.570 --> 13:33.174
with the list of dosages on it--

13:33.210 --> 13:35.474
you took it to the hospital
where she worked?

13:35.510 --> 13:37.569
None of the doctors had
any idea what it was.

13:37.610 --> 13:39.475
Why?

13:39.510 --> 13:42.149
I'm not sure yet.

13:42.180 --> 13:45.047
But Jacoby's autopsy is
scheduled for the morning.

13:45.090 --> 13:47.058
If it reveals what
I think it might,

13:51.060 --> 13:53.221
I don't know how it happened,
but Chris Jacoby incurred

13:53.260 --> 13:55.490
heavy brain damage recently.

13:55.530 --> 13:57.168
There's serious deterioration

13:57.200 --> 13:59.168
of the cerebellum and
the cerebral cortex

13:59.200 --> 14:02.135
and basal ganglia.
He had a baseline scan

14:02.170 --> 14:03.398
done recently.

14:03.440 --> 14:05.431
_You can see
he was fine a few months ago.

14:05.470 --> 14:10.078
The autopsy performed
on Marissa Ledbetter

14:10.110 --> 14:12.169
did not detect
similar results, did it?

14:12.210 --> 14:14.110
And the toxicology test

14:14.150 --> 14:15.469
you did on Jacoby,

14:15.520 --> 14:18.489
did you find any strange
or unusual substances?

14:18.520 --> 14:20.078
We did.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.587
There was a chemical
in his system--

14:21.620 --> 14:23.326
I haven't seen it before.

14:23.360 --> 14:25.180
We're trying to figure
out what it is.

14:25.230 --> 14:26.629
Don't bother.
You won't find it registered.

14:26.660 --> 14:28.150
How do you know that?

14:28.200 --> 14:29.189
Jacoby was unemployed.

14:29.230 --> 14:30.527
He was desperate for money.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.128
He receives a payment

14:32.170 --> 14:33.637
from an untraceable
shell corporation.

14:33.670 --> 14:34.989
Then he goes missing.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.189
When he turns up a week later,

14:36.240 --> 14:39.038
he's a killer
with a destroyed brain.

14:39.070 --> 14:40.378
And a mysterious chemical
in his system.

14:40.410 --> 14:43.004
Marissa Ledbetter.
She has crushing debt.

14:43.050 --> 14:44.677
She receives a payment.
She's then found murdered

14:44.710 --> 14:48.043
with a list of chemical dosages
in her pocket.

14:48.080 --> 14:49.672
So, you think someone
paid Chris Jacoby

14:49.720 --> 14:52.041
to take whatever drug
we found in his system.

14:52.090 --> 14:54.081
You're talking about
an illegal drug trial.

14:54.120 --> 14:55.656
I think your friend
Ms. Ledbetter

14:55.690 --> 14:57.453
was the nurse in charge
of administering

14:57.490 --> 14:59.481
whatever chemical
Purgatorium, Incorporated,

14:59.530 --> 15:01.259
is manufacturing.

15:01.300 --> 15:02.927
The drug clearly did not work

15:02.970 --> 15:04.460
the way that
they intended it to.

15:04.500 --> 15:06.092
It destroyed Jacoby's brain.

15:06.130 --> 15:08.291
And in his delusional state,
he attacked Marissa

15:08.340 --> 15:10.535
and escaped whatever facility
they were using.

15:10.570 --> 15:12.128
Whoever was in charge
of the trial

15:12.170 --> 15:14.001
put her body in the Dumpster.

15:14.040 --> 15:15.632
KITTY: If that's true,
whoever did the trial

15:15.680 --> 15:18.171
must've been desperate
to find Chris Jacoby.

15:18.210 --> 15:20.110
Given what we know,

15:20.150 --> 15:22.311
I find it very hard
to believe that his murder

15:22.350 --> 15:24.989
is the petty robbery
that it appears to be.

15:25.020 --> 15:27.113
I_ think someone's
tying up loose ends.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.082
So, you're saying
that Jacoby killed Marissa,

15:29.120 --> 15:31.259
but in a way,
he wasn't responsible for it.

15:31.290 --> 15:33.121
The truly guilty party
is whoever set up the trial

15:33.160 --> 15:35.321
and ruined his brain.
And what's more,

15:35.360 --> 15:37.567
_ no_ scientific trial
is gomg to administer

15:37.600 --> 15:40.239
experimental drugs
to just one recipient.

15:40.270 --> 15:41.294
Results would be
meaningless.

15:41.340 --> 15:44.434
The document we found
on Marissa Ledbetter's body...

15:44.470 --> 15:46.665
It has five different dosages

15:46.710 --> 15:50.498
of the chemical
they call E-Zed-M-77.

15:50.550 --> 15:53.144
Five dosages, five patients.

15:53.180 --> 15:55.478
They gave the drug
to four other people.

16:01.190 --> 16:03.283
So, you think
somebody is running

16:03.330 --> 16:05.389
an unauthorized drug trial

16:05.430 --> 16:07.557
in the middle of the city?

16:07.600 --> 16:09.192
What does this...

16:09.230 --> 16:12.358
EZM-77 do?

16:12.400 --> 16:14.038
We don't know
what it's supposed to do,

16:14.070 --> 16:15.662
but if you take it,
you get brain damage.

16:15.700 --> 16:17.065
I've studied
plenty of drug trials

16:17.110 --> 16:18.737
in medical school.
These things don't happen

16:18.770 --> 16:20.203
in a vacuum.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.037
They're expensive
and they take time.

16:22.080 --> 16:23.445
_ There are four _
or five companies that drive

16:23.480 --> 16:25.402
almost every advancement
in the field.

16:25.450 --> 16:27.315
This probably traces
back to one of them.

16:27.350 --> 16:28.749
Now, you're talking
about public corporations.

16:28.780 --> 16:31.214
Would they really risk
an illegal trial?

16:31.250 --> 16:32.717
If a company thought
they were on to something,

16:32.750 --> 16:34.217
and it could increase
their market share?

16:34.260 --> 16:35.284
Sure, I could definitely see it.

16:35.320 --> 16:37.083
Get a drug that works first,

16:37.130 --> 16:38.427
and then try and fast-track it
through the system.

16:38.460 --> 16:40.223
So, how do we figure out

16:40.260 --> 16:41.750
which company it is?

16:41.800 --> 16:43.768
Well, Jacoby was just one
participant in the experiment.

16:43.800 --> 16:45.199
We think there were four others.

16:45.230 --> 16:47.289
The fastest way is
to find one of them,

16:47.340 --> 16:49.160
and see if they can lead us
back to the company

16:49.200 --> 16:51.168
that staged the trial.

16:51.210 --> 16:53.178
"Bella, Edward,

16:53.210 --> 16:55.337
'Uacob.

16:55.380 --> 16:57.575
Immune to supernatural
powers of the mind."

16:57.610 --> 16:59.475
Wait a minute.

16:59.510 --> 17:02.217
Are you guys researching
the Twilight books?

17:02.250 --> 17:04.309
We heard back from our friends
at Everyone.

17:04.350 --> 17:06.511
They've agreed to compile a list
of everyone who's received

17:06.550 --> 17:09.189
a payment from Purgatorium,
Incorporated,

17:09.220 --> 17:10.380
since its inception

17:10.430 --> 17:11.658
last month.

17:11.690 --> 17:13.294
In exchange, they want me
to compose a treatise

17:13.330 --> 17:15.457
on why the character of Bella
should've ended up

17:15.500 --> 17:17.695
with Jacob rather than Edward.

17:17.730 --> 17:19.618
Apparently, there's some kind
of convention in town,

17:19.670 --> 17:22.230
and then want me to read
my essay out loud in the lobby.

17:22.270 --> 17:24.306
Personally, I see no reason
why they couldn't have come

17:24.340 --> 17:26.399
to some arrangement which
involved all three of them.

17:26.440 --> 17:27.737
But that's the position
that Everyone

17:27.780 --> 17:29.407
has asked me to take, so...

17:29.440 --> 17:31.374
Everyone never gets tired
of embarrassing you, do they?

17:31.410 --> 17:34.277
Humiliation is the favorite
currency of the hacker.

17:34.320 --> 17:36.413
Everyone didn't mention
anything about me

17:36.450 --> 17:38.111
reading anything
out loud, did they?

17:38.150 --> 17:40.357
No.
Excellent.

17:40.390 --> 17:41.550
Well, I'm gonna...

17:41.590 --> 17:43.649
work from home.

17:43.690 --> 17:47.319
(classical music playing)

17:51.430 --> 17:54.399
(lock clicks)

17:54.440 --> 17:56.590
(door opening, latches clicking)

17:56.640 --> 17:58.608
Hello?

17:58.640 --> 18:02.406
*

18:02.440 --> 18:04.305
Hmm, that's pretty.

18:04.350 --> 18:07.274
It seems suitable_
for pondering eternity.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.311
You came in

18:09.350 --> 18:11.341
using keys, not lock picks.

18:11.390 --> 18:12.812
Kitty had a key made for me.

18:12.850 --> 18:14.818
She didn't want me
to have to break in

18:14.860 --> 18:17.420
every time you didn't feel like,
uh, answering the door.

18:17.460 --> 18:21.191
And why are we pondering
eternity this morning?

18:21.230 --> 18:23.198
These are the _five men
who received

18:25.230 --> 18:28.336
You're familiar
with Christopher Jacoby.

18:28.370 --> 18:30.361
The man next to him,
Spencer Redding,

18:30.410 --> 18:31.604
checked into a hospital
three days ago

18:31.640 --> 18:33.335
with tremors in his limbs.

18:33.380 --> 18:35.200
He died a day later.

18:35.240 --> 18:36.776
An autopsy revealed damage

18:36.810 --> 18:38.505
to his cerebellum,
cerebral cortex

18:38.550 --> 18:40.472
and basal ganglia.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.169
Now, there have been
missing persons complaints

18:42.220 --> 18:43.312
filed on behalf of two

18:43.350 --> 18:44.385
of the remaining men.

18:44.420 --> 18:46.718
The last one, Louis Carlisle,

18:46.750 --> 18:48.183
not officially missing,
but he hasn't shown up

18:48.220 --> 18:49.619
for work in almost a week.

18:49.660 --> 18:51.787
I've dispatched Kitty
to inquire after him,

18:51.830 --> 18:53.627
although I'm not very hopeful.

18:53.660 --> 18:55.321
So, you think
these men were murdered

18:55.360 --> 18:56.554
by the same person
who killed Jacoby?

18:56.600 --> 18:58.329
Spencer Redding was
barely coherent

18:58.370 --> 19:00.395
when he checked into hospital.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.829
But he was awake long enough
for a doctor to ask him his age.

19:02.870 --> 19:05.930
Apparently, Spencer said
he was 34 years old,

19:05.970 --> 19:08.177
but he'd been alive
for many more years than that.

19:08.210 --> 19:11.407
Sounds like the same things that
Jacoby wrote in his journal.

19:11.450 --> 19:13.748
What are the chances
of two men with brain damage

19:13.780 --> 19:15.543
experiencing virtually
identical delusions?

19:15.580 --> 19:18.310
Miniscule._
I have a notion

19:18.350 --> 19:20.511
what E-Zed-M-77 is meant to do.

19:20.560 --> 19:21.879
I think someone has
been experimenting

19:21.920 --> 19:24.525
with time-dilating drugs.

19:24.560 --> 19:26.949
Such chemicals target
the regions of the brain

19:26.990 --> 19:29.356
which govern
the perception of time.

19:29.400 --> 19:30.719
The cerebellum,
the cerebral cortex

19:30.770 --> 19:33.398
and the basal ganglia.
These drugs

19:33.440 --> 19:35.465
would speed up the functioning
of these regions

19:35.500 --> 19:37.309
so that the person
who took them would experience

19:37.340 --> 19:39.467
one hour as, say, two hours.

19:39.510 --> 19:42.274
Or a week or, theoretically...

19:42.310 --> 19:43.675
hundreds of years.

19:43.710 --> 19:46.543
Sounds like you're saying
that these drugs stop time.

19:46.580 --> 19:49.378
Not quite. They just cram
more neurological function

19:49.420 --> 19:51.581
into a shorter
period of time. Now...

19:51.620 --> 19:54.350
the potential
applications are vast.

19:54.390 --> 19:55.459
You could learn a new language

19:55.490 --> 19:57.526
_ or a new skill
in a couple of weeks.

19:57.560 --> 19:59.448
You could sentence a prisoner
to one day in prison,

19:59.490 --> 20:01.321
and he would emerge
having experienced

20:01.360 --> 20:03.419
the equivalent of ten years
worth of punishment.

20:03.470 --> 20:04.926
You think someone invented that?

20:04.970 --> 20:06.369
I think there are still
kinks to be worked out.

20:06.400 --> 20:08.960
Now, whether or not
Jacoby and the others

20:09.000 --> 20:11.366
experienced
actual time dilation?

20:11.410 --> 20:12.934
It's very difficult to say.

20:12.970 --> 20:14.608
They would presumably
have been briefed

20:14.640 --> 20:16.676
on the potential effects
of the drug,

20:16.710 --> 20:19.406
so it's possible their damaged
brain seized on that information

20:19.450 --> 20:21.611
and built a delusion around it.

20:21.650 --> 20:24.448
ODIN: You have approached Odin.
Your photograph has been taken

20:24.490 --> 20:25.787
I'm helping Alfredo
with something, so...

20:25.820 --> 20:27.458
and forwarded to the
authorities. You have...

20:27.490 --> 20:29.879
(phone chimes)

20:29.920 --> 20:33.424
Kitty went
to Carlisle's workplace.

20:33.460 --> 20:34.950
He hasn't been there
for a while.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.399
One of his colleagues said

20:36.430 --> 20:38.796
they received an e-mail
from him last night.

20:38.830 --> 20:41.469
Apparently, he's gone
into hiding.

20:41.500 --> 20:43.365
Someone who took the drug
is still alive?

20:45.440 --> 20:48.034
Lou's only been into work
once this week.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.479
And he had to go home early.

20:49.510 --> 20:50.977
He was in bad shape.

20:51.010 --> 20:52.443
Did his e-mail say

20:52.480 --> 20:54.368
why he planned to
go into hiding?

20:54.420 --> 20:55.876
He said people were
following him.

20:55.920 --> 20:57.911
He thinks his life's in danger.

20:59.890 --> 21:01.653
Is that true?

21:01.690 --> 21:03.658
I thought he was having

21:03.690 --> 21:04.782
a breakdown or something.

21:04.830 --> 21:06.479
We're not sure.

21:06.530 --> 21:08.350
Did he mention
where he was going?

21:08.400 --> 21:09.753
Uh-uh.

21:09.800 --> 21:11.768
Jessa and I talked
before you got here.

21:11.800 --> 21:13.768
Apparently, Lou's been having
money problems.

21:13.800 --> 21:16.633
Yeah, ever since
his mom got cancer.

21:16.670 --> 21:18.331
He was helping pay
for her treatments

21:18.370 --> 21:19.462
right up until she died.

21:19.510 --> 21:22.604
Any idea what happened to her
apartment after she died?

21:22.640 --> 21:25.643
I think Lou was getting it
ready to go on the market.

21:25.680 --> 21:28.012
An empty apartment and
a desperate young man

21:28.050 --> 21:30.416
in need of a hiding place.

21:36.520 --> 21:39.523
Louis Carlisle,
we're with the NYPD.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.991
Hello?

21:45.530 --> 21:47.361
If you'd like
to test your skills

21:47.400 --> 21:49.539
in a practical environment,
the floor is yours.

21:55.880 --> 21:58.872
That's a bit unwieldy for the
job at hand, don't you think?

22:02.450 --> 22:04.418
Um, that's too delicate
for the deadbolt.

22:04.450 --> 22:05.610
Would you two mind?

22:09.720 --> 22:11.585
(clicking)

22:12.590 --> 22:14.592
Hello?

22:14.630 --> 22:16.495
Louis Carlisle?

22:18.430 --> 22:20.398
Mr. Carlisle,
we're here to help you!

22:20.440 --> 22:22.590
Stay away from me!

22:22.640 --> 22:24.039
(panicked muttering)

22:24.070 --> 22:27.107
We're from the NYPD,
we're not gonna hurt you.

22:27.140 --> 22:28.038
Mr. Carlisle,
we know about E-Zed-M.

22:28.080 --> 22:29.968
We know that there are
people after you.

22:30.010 --> 22:31.568
If you tell us
about the trial,

22:31.610 --> 22:33.749
we'll make sure that _
they never threaten you again.

22:35.020 --> 22:36.612
You'll keep me safe?

22:40.020 --> 22:41.988
If you can help me,

22:42.020 --> 22:44.454
I'll t-tell you... I'll tell you
whatever you want to know.

22:44.490 --> 22:46.481
I'll tell you everything.

22:52.100 --> 22:53.636
KITTY:
It's odd, the other people

22:53.670 --> 22:55.035
who took this drug
could barely talk.

22:55.070 --> 22:56.697
One of them
we know went insane.

22:56.740 --> 22:58.105
But he seems...

22:58.140 --> 23:00.734
not fine, exactly,
but he's functioning.

23:00.780 --> 23:03.169
The experimenters gave
different amounts of the drug

23:03.210 --> 23:06.145
to everyone who participated
in the experiment.

23:06.180 --> 23:08.148
Clearly got some sort
of brain damage.

23:08.180 --> 23:09.738
Look at his hand.

23:09.780 --> 23:12.487
Must have gotten the
smallest dosage.

23:17.490 --> 23:19.458
Just so we're clear,
Mr. Carlisle,

23:19.490 --> 23:21.458
you're not under arrest.

23:21.500 --> 23:24.924
We just want to ask you
some questions, all right?

23:24.970 --> 23:27.097
Who did this to you?

23:27.130 --> 23:29.189
I wish I could
give you names.

23:29.240 --> 23:32.630
Wait a minute, you participated
in an experimental drug trial

23:32.670 --> 23:34.570
without even knowing
who was conducting it?

23:35.980 --> 23:37.948
It was a lot of money.

23:37.980 --> 23:40.949
It was 150 grand, up front.

23:40.980 --> 23:43.619
Another 150 grand a year
for the rest of my life,

23:43.650 --> 23:46.915
ifI didn't, you know,
tell anyone about the study.

23:46.950 --> 23:48.884
They were gonna give you
$150,000 a year

23:48.920 --> 23:50.478
for the rest
of your life?

23:50.530 --> 23:53.158
They said it was
incentive to keep quiet.

23:55.830 --> 23:58.799
I mean, did it
seem shady?

23:58.830 --> 24:00.491
Of course, but...

24:00.540 --> 24:02.963
that kind of money,
I can live with shady.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.809
How'd you find out
about the study?

24:04.840 --> 24:05.966
It was just
an ad online.

24:06.010 --> 24:07.875
Had an e-mail address.

24:07.910 --> 24:10.003
I wrote them,
they wrote back.

24:10.040 --> 24:12.008
It was all anonymous.

24:12.050 --> 24:15.019
But the wire
transfer cleared,

24:15.050 --> 24:17.985
and, you know, it-it
seemed professional.

24:18.020 --> 24:20.580
And the trial itself,
where did it take place?

24:20.620 --> 24:23.987
Just some office
they rented out.

24:24.030 --> 24:27.022
They gave me the drugs, and
I spent the night there.

24:30.030 --> 24:33.193
They said, um, I might feel
like a lot of time is passing,

24:33.230 --> 24:34.891
and it definitely
felt weird,

24:34.940 --> 24:36.066
but I was okay.

24:36.100 --> 24:38.159
Till a couple days later...

24:41.180 --> 24:43.171
...when this started.

24:45.180 --> 24:47.148
I sent them an e-mail.

24:47.180 --> 24:49.740
Thought they'd help.

24:49.780 --> 24:51.782
Instead, people start
following me.

24:51.820 --> 24:54.015
People, who?
What did they look like?

24:54.060 --> 24:56.187
I don't know, I never got
a great look at anybody.

24:56.220 --> 24:58.723
How about the people who came
to you to conduct the study?

24:58.760 --> 24:59.784
Can you describe them?

24:59.830 --> 25:02.549
Yeah, sure, um...

25:02.600 --> 25:04.227
There was a nurse.

25:04.270 --> 25:06.522
You guys know
about her already.

25:06.570 --> 25:08.538
I saw another person.

25:08.570 --> 25:10.936
Once.

25:10.970 --> 25:12.938
Black guy.

25:12.970 --> 25:15.177
He was about 40.

25:15.210 --> 25:17.178
I think he, uh...

25:17.210 --> 25:19.098
I think he was
the one in charge.

25:22.750 --> 25:24.741
(cell phone chimes)

25:30.990 --> 25:33.026
(door opens)

25:33.060 --> 25:36.689
Hey.

25:36.730 --> 25:39.563
To what do I owe the pleasure
of this unannounced visit?

25:39.600 --> 25:41.033
Alfredo called me.

25:41.070 --> 25:43.163
He said you missed
a meeting, he was worried.

25:43.200 --> 25:45.907
I'm working, Watson.

25:45.940 --> 25:48.170
We have a sketch of the
man who is in charge

25:48.210 --> 25:50.178
of the illegal drug trial.
Now...

25:50.210 --> 25:52.644
someone with a talent for
dabbling in time-dilating drugs

25:52.680 --> 25:54.648
is not your
average citizen.

25:54.680 --> 25:56.216
He is, in all likelihood,
connected to one

25:56.250 --> 25:58.013
of the major pharmaceutical
conglomerates.

25:58.050 --> 26:00.018
So, you're going
through their annual reports,

26:00.050 --> 26:01.654
looking for a picture
that matches.

26:01.690 --> 26:04.250
I was looking through
their annual reports,

26:04.290 --> 26:08.021
till I found a photograph
of Dr. Dwyer Kirke, PhD.

26:08.060 --> 26:10.927
Hmm.

26:10.970 --> 26:12.221
That's him.

26:12.270 --> 26:14.238
Dr. Kirke heads up a
research laboratory

26:14.270 --> 26:16.830
at Ubient
Pharmaceuticals.

26:16.870 --> 26:19.805
He's a leading light in the
field of neurochemistry.

26:19.840 --> 26:21.808
I do believe we
have found our man.

26:21.840 --> 26:23.000
Did you tell Marcus?

26:23.040 --> 26:26.077
The NYPD are on the prowl
for Dr. Kirke.

26:26.110 --> 26:27.042
Okay, that's great.

26:27.080 --> 26:28.377
So, you're not exactly
working anymore, right?

26:28.420 --> 26:29.944
I mean, the police know
who did it.

26:29.980 --> 26:31.117
So why not go
to a meeting

26:31.150 --> 26:32.947
while they go
and find this guy Kirke?

26:32.990 --> 26:35.083
I sent Kitty to look
through the office space

26:35.120 --> 26:37.850
where the trial was conducted,
and I need to be available

26:37.890 --> 26:40.051
should she wish
to get in touch.

26:40.090 --> 26:42.399
What's going on?

26:42.430 --> 26:43.795
Hmm?

26:43.830 --> 26:45.889
You're skipping meetings.

26:48.070 --> 26:50.391
What is going on?

26:50.440 --> 26:53.204
Sherlock?

26:56.140 --> 26:58.108
Okay.

26:58.150 --> 27:00.744
Well, I can't force you
to talk to me.

27:01.880 --> 27:03.939
But I wish you would.

27:08.120 --> 27:11.089
If you must know, Watson...

27:11.130 --> 27:13.826
I've been feeling a
little bit down of late.

27:15.730 --> 27:18.426
It's the process
of maintaining my sobriety.

27:18.470 --> 27:21.098
It's repetitive.

27:21.140 --> 27:23.438
And it's relentless.

27:23.470 --> 27:26.837
And above all, it's tedious.

27:31.480 --> 27:34.449
When I left rehab, I...

27:34.480 --> 27:36.448
I accepted your influence.

27:36.480 --> 27:39.119
I committed to my recovery.

27:39.150 --> 27:41.118
And now...

27:41.160 --> 27:43.458
two years in...

27:43.490 --> 27:47.119
I found myself asking,

27:47.160 --> 27:49.651
is this it?

27:52.230 --> 27:54.835
My sobriety is simply a grind.

27:57.240 --> 27:59.003
It's just this leaky faucet

27:59.040 --> 28:02.407
which requires
constant maintenance.

28:02.440 --> 28:05.477
And in return offers only...

28:05.510 --> 28:07.717
not to drip.

28:10.220 --> 28:13.018
You have your work.

28:13.050 --> 28:14.449
You have me.

28:14.490 --> 28:15.809
You're alive.

28:15.860 --> 28:18.078
I've told myself that
many times.

28:21.100 --> 28:25.764
So many times that it has become
unmoored from all meaning.

28:25.800 --> 28:28.064
(chuckles)

28:28.100 --> 28:29.499
Odd.

28:29.540 --> 28:32.509
I, uh...

28:32.540 --> 28:36.499
I used to imagine that
a relapse would be the climax

28:36.540 --> 28:40.101
to some grand drama.

28:44.790 --> 28:48.089
Now I think that
if I were to use drugs again,

28:48.120 --> 28:51.954
it would _in_fact be
an anticlimax.

28:54.560 --> 28:56.528
It would be a surrender

28:56.560 --> 29:00.098
to the incessant drip,
dnp,dnp

29:00.130 --> 29:02.132
of existence.

29:17.920 --> 29:20.309
I'm sorry you're
feeling this way.

29:23.320 --> 29:25.322
What can I do to help?

29:29.100 --> 29:31.295
Do you want to maybe
speak to Alfredo?

29:31.330 --> 29:34.299
Yes, I think perhaps
I will see Alfredo.

29:40.570 --> 29:43.539
But in any case,

29:43.580 --> 29:45.400
I shan't be using drugs
this evening.

29:51.190 --> 29:53.181
(playing "Reveille" on bugle)
(Watson gasps)

29:57.190 --> 29:58.851
(groans)

29:58.890 --> 30:00.221
Cold feet on the
warm deck, Watson.

30:00.260 --> 30:01.852
(groans)

30:01.900 --> 30:03.049
It's a wonderful morning
to be preoccupied

30:03.100 --> 30:04.499
by the meaninglessness
of existence.

30:04.530 --> 30:06.259
(groans)
Why is that?

30:06.300 --> 30:08.029
It led you to spend
the night here.

30:08.070 --> 30:10.436
Which, in turn, affords me
the opportunity to rouse you.

30:10.470 --> 30:11.937
I've missed it.

30:11.970 --> 30:13.164
Food.

30:13.210 --> 30:14.575
Clothing.

30:14.610 --> 30:17.170
Which you left here
when you moved out.

30:17.210 --> 30:18.609
I didn't know
you played the bugle.

30:18.650 --> 30:19.742
I have a bugle.

30:19.780 --> 30:22.078
I spent the last hour learning
that particular tune.

30:22.120 --> 30:25.214
The police searched Dwyer
Kirke's apartment last night.

30:25.250 --> 30:27.343
They found several hidden
vials of a chemical,

30:27.390 --> 30:29.051
which matches the
one that we found

30:29.090 --> 30:30.387
inside Chris Jacoby's body.

30:30.420 --> 30:32.388
And some written
records of the trial.

30:32.430 --> 30:34.398
We have everything we need
to make an arrest.

30:34.430 --> 30:35.954
Except for Dwyer Kirke himself.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.968
I have a notion where
we might find him.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.968
With a bit of luck,
we can apprehend him

30:40.000 --> 30:41.592
and convince him
to turn on his superiors

30:41.640 --> 30:43.938
at Ubient Pharmaceutical
by, say, lunchtime.

30:43.970 --> 30:45.039
Are you gonna wake up Kitty?

30:45.070 --> 30:46.207
Of course not.

30:46.240 --> 30:48.435
I am a courteous housemate.

30:52.510 --> 30:54.375
BELL:
This guy, Kirke,

30:54.420 --> 30:56.479
he's running
from murder charges.

30:56.520 --> 30:58.283
Why exactly are you
expecting him to show up

30:58.320 --> 30:59.412
at his aunt's nursing home?

30:59.450 --> 31:01.418
Dvwer Kirke has
power of attorney

31:01.460 --> 31:02.586
over his aunt's affairs.

31:02.620 --> 31:04.622
He's responsible
for her care.

31:04.660 --> 31:07.220
She raised him, and,
according to the staff here,

31:07.260 --> 31:08.921
he's a regular visitor.

31:08.960 --> 31:12.088
Poor woman is recovering
from a broken hip.

31:12.130 --> 31:13.939
That can be the kiss of death
to elderly patients.

31:13.970 --> 31:14.994
Isn't that right, Watson?

31:15.040 --> 31:15.995
It's a psychological thing.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.462
They have a tendency to give up.

31:17.500 --> 31:19.309
SHERLOCK: Mr. Kirke has
accompanied his aunt

31:19.340 --> 31:22.070
to every physical therapy
session she's undergone.

31:22.110 --> 31:24.078
I think it's fair to say
that his presence,

31:24.110 --> 31:26.078
motivating factor that it is,

31:26.110 --> 31:28.112
could be the difference between
life and death for her.

31:28.150 --> 31:30.277
She has a physical therapy
session starting in 20 minutes.

31:31.950 --> 31:34.350
I'm just saying-- you're
putting a lot of faith in a guy

31:34.390 --> 31:36.017
behind at least
three homicides.

31:36.060 --> 31:38.551
The killings were
an undesired side effect

31:38.590 --> 31:41.150
of his experiment gone
disastrously wrong.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.191
He's not a murderer
by avocation.

31:43.230 --> 31:45.221
(elevator bell dings,
doors sliding open)

31:48.070 --> 31:49.196
Marcus.

31:51.970 --> 31:53.403
Dvwer Kirke?

31:53.440 --> 31:55.931
You're a good nephew.

31:55.980 --> 31:58.608
You're also under arrest.

32:01.050 --> 32:03.109
Listen...

32:03.150 --> 32:04.139
you've got me.

32:04.190 --> 32:05.248
I understand that.

32:05.290 --> 32:06.245
Just, please...

32:06.290 --> 32:08.155
be careful with
my research.

32:08.190 --> 32:09.009
It's important.

32:09.060 --> 32:10.948
It needs to be
published.

32:10.990 --> 32:13.458
People will want to continue
this work once I'm in prison.

32:13.490 --> 32:15.048
GREGSON:
You're referring
to the work

32:15.100 --> 32:17.989
that ruined the brains
of five different people?

32:18.030 --> 32:20.066
Obviously,
there were issues.

32:20.100 --> 32:21.089
We had dosage problems.

32:21.140 --> 32:22.960
But this is
incredible stuff.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.036
Some of those people
experienced

32:25.070 --> 32:26.264
actual time dilation.

32:26.310 --> 32:27.663
You don't know that.

32:27.710 --> 32:30.099
BELL:
You don't strike me as someone

32:30.140 --> 32:32.005
who's eager to throw
their life away.

32:32.050 --> 32:33.642
Why wouldn't you
just test the drug

32:33.680 --> 32:35.079
through the proper channels?

32:35.120 --> 32:36.542
We couldn't.
We had to move quickly.

32:36.580 --> 32:38.081
Why?

32:38.120 --> 32:41.988
GREGSON:
You said "we,"
Dr. Kirke.

32:42.020 --> 32:43.453
Right now,
there is no "we."

32:43.490 --> 32:45.287
You're the one
taking the charges.

32:45.330 --> 32:48.390
The trial cost
north of $1 million.

32:48.430 --> 32:51.126
There's no way that
you could've financed that

32:51.170 --> 32:53.024
on your own.

32:53.070 --> 32:54.196
We're also reasonably certain

32:54.240 --> 32:55.992
you weren't the one
running around

32:56.040 --> 32:57.359
killing people when
things went south.

33:00.040 --> 33:02.474
Tell us about Ubient.

33:02.510 --> 33:05.445
Give us names, and we'll do
what we can for you.

33:05.480 --> 33:08.040
I'm not telling you anything
about where the money came from.

33:08.080 --> 33:10.469
GREGSON:
You think they're gonna pay you
to carry the weight on this?

33:10.520 --> 33:12.647
KIRKE:
It's got nothing to do
with getting paid.

33:12.690 --> 33:14.715
I'll tell you about the study,

33:14.760 --> 33:17.058
I'll take responsibility
for the deaths,

33:17.090 --> 33:19.183
but I will never
say a word

33:19.230 --> 33:20.288
about the funding.

33:22.200 --> 33:24.122
I'd like my lavwer now.

33:27.230 --> 33:29.664
Why would he go to prison
for the rest of his life

33:29.700 --> 33:31.668
just to protect his bosses?

33:31.710 --> 33:34.178
No one gives up everything
just for a corporation.

33:34.210 --> 33:35.404
No, that kind of resolve...

33:35.440 --> 33:37.738
This is personal
to him.

33:37.780 --> 33:40.169
WATSON:
You think we were wrong
about Ubient.

33:40.210 --> 33:42.178
They didn't
give him the money.

33:42.220 --> 33:46.111
Dr. _Kirke is not
protecting a company.

33:46.150 --> 33:48.152
He's protecting a person.

33:55.260 --> 33:57.592
ALFREDO:
There some reason we
can't turn the lights on?

33:57.630 --> 33:59.359
HOLMES:
Yes.

33:59.400 --> 34:02.597
The sensor is
remarkably sophisticated.

34:02.640 --> 34:05.200
It's virtually impossible
to approach it

34:05.240 --> 34:08.232
without incurring
Odin's wrath.

34:08.280 --> 34:09.736
ODIN:
You have approached Odin.

34:09.780 --> 34:11.372
Your photograph has been taken
and forwarded

34:11.410 --> 34:13.241
to the authorities.
There isn't enough time

34:13.280 --> 34:15.168
to deactivate it
before the alarm goes off.

34:15.220 --> 34:17.211
You have ten seconds
to back away.
However...

34:17.250 --> 34:19.684
Ten. Nine.

34:19.720 --> 34:22.257
Eight. Seven.
If you manipulate
the electrolytic capacitor

34:22.290 --> 34:24.758
_Six. Five.
on a disposable camera
and run our rigging

34:24.790 --> 34:26.280
Four.
through a suitable
load coil,

34:26.330 --> 34:28.298
Three.
you can generate
an electromagnetic pulse

34:28.330 --> 34:31.595
Two. One. _
capable of scrambling
the alarm's electronics.

34:31.630 --> 34:33.291
(alarm whooping,
alarm shuts off)

34:35.340 --> 34:38.161
As you can see, the Norseman
falls quite silent.

34:38.210 --> 34:40.201
You ruined the rest
of the electronics.

34:40.240 --> 34:43.175
You didn't beat the alarm
if you can't steal the car.

34:43.210 --> 34:45.201
Actually,
electronic devices

34:45.250 --> 34:48.378
are more susceptible to an
EMP if they're turned on.

34:48.420 --> 34:49.773
You simply calibrate the pulse

34:49.820 --> 34:51.287
so it doesn't affect

34:51.320 --> 34:52.446
the automobile'_s
dormant electronics,

34:52.490 --> 34:55.755
and the prize is yours.

34:55.790 --> 34:56.757
(phone buzzes)

34:56.790 --> 34:58.280
An electromagnetic pulse.

34:58.330 --> 34:59.456
Mm-hmm.

34:59.490 --> 35:01.219
Well, I never would've
thought of that.

35:01.260 --> 35:02.796
Yes, well, you're a burglar.

35:02.830 --> 35:04.297
You're a very good one,

35:04.330 --> 35:06.195
but you're not
an electrical engineer.

35:06.230 --> 35:07.458
Well, neither are you.

35:07.500 --> 35:09.138
Mmm.

35:11.840 --> 35:13.535
So we haven't talked
about the meetings.

35:13.570 --> 35:15.709
What's up?

35:15.740 --> 35:18.743
You coming back?

35:18.780 --> 35:20.247
Yeah, I can't promise

35:20.280 --> 35:22.817
I'm gonna find any more meaning
in them, but...

35:22.850 --> 35:25.887
I respect you and everything
you have done for me.

35:25.920 --> 35:27.547
So if you want me there,
I'll go.

35:27.590 --> 35:29.410
Think that'd be a good idea.

35:29.460 --> 35:30.859
(phone ringing)

35:32.960 --> 35:33.779
Watson.

35:33.830 --> 35:35.593
WATSON:
Hey, I got your message to call,

35:35.630 --> 35:36.892
but if you're still
with Alfredo...

35:36.930 --> 35:38.659
No, we're just finishing up.

35:38.700 --> 35:39.928
So what's going on?

35:39.970 --> 35:41.938
I think I know who funded

35:41.970 --> 35:43.767
Dvwer Kirke's illegal trial.

35:43.800 --> 35:45.802
(intercom buzzes)

35:47.670 --> 35:48.637
MAN (over intercom):
Hello?

35:48.680 --> 35:49.635
Oh, good evening!

35:49.680 --> 35:50.806
We'd like a quick word

35:50.840 --> 35:51.943
with Jack
Connaughton, please.

35:51.980 --> 35:53.572
I'm afraid Mr. Connaughton

35:53.610 --> 35:55.214
isn't feeling well this evening.

35:55.250 --> 35:57.468
Oh, I'm confident
he'll make time for us.

35:57.520 --> 35:59.784
Tell him our business involves
an illegal clinical trial,

35:59.820 --> 36:02.857
several murders and a drug
which promises its users

36:02.890 --> 36:05.358
a kind of
immortality.

36:13.430 --> 36:14.397
Ah.

36:14.440 --> 36:15.737
Thank you, Brett.

36:17.740 --> 36:19.731
Something to drink?

36:19.770 --> 36:21.806
I don't touch the hard stuff
myself anymore.

36:21.840 --> 36:22.807
HOLMES:
Mr. Connaughton,

36:22.840 --> 36:24.649
did you know the NYPD

36:24.680 --> 36:26.875
arrested a_ man named
Dvwer Kirke today?

36:26.910 --> 36:28.741
He's been pursuing
the invention

36:28.780 --> 36:30.919
of time-dilating drugs.

36:30.950 --> 36:32.838
I hadn't heard that.

36:32.890 --> 36:33.743
HOLMES:
At first, we assumed

36:33.790 --> 36:35.781
that Mr. Kirke was working

36:35.820 --> 36:38.357
on behalf of his employers
at Ubient Pharmaceutical.

36:38.390 --> 36:41.791
But he's been strangely reticent
to name his sponsors.

36:41.830 --> 36:43.889
That led us to believe

36:43.930 --> 36:46.763
that he was being funded
by a private benefactor.

36:46.800 --> 36:48.734
You know Dvwer
Kirke, don't you?

36:48.770 --> 36:51.807
Name sounds familiar.

36:52.810 --> 36:54.471
Well, the two of
you crossed paths

36:54.510 --> 36:55.932
not long after you
sold your first patent

36:55.980 --> 36:58.278
for $20 million.

36:58.310 --> 37:00.642
You set up a
scholarship fund

37:00.680 --> 37:02.443
for promising kids from
inner-city neighborhoods.

37:02.480 --> 37:04.812
Your charity pulled him
out of a terrible school

37:04.850 --> 37:06.818
and placed him into
the Appleford Academy,

37:06.850 --> 37:09.353
and you gave his
aunt a stipend

37:09.390 --> 37:10.414
to help
raise him.

37:10.460 --> 37:12.553
We've helped a lot of kids.

37:12.590 --> 37:14.399
But he's the one you called

37:14.430 --> 37:15.897
when you learned
that you were dying

37:15.930 --> 37:17.522
of pulmonary hypertension,
isn't he?

37:17.560 --> 37:21.530
I haven't told anyone
about my diagnosis.

37:21.570 --> 37:23.367
You paid Dvwer Kirke

37:23.400 --> 37:25.368
to develop E-Zed-M.

37:25.410 --> 37:26.832
He owed you everything,

37:26.870 --> 37:28.838
so he obliged.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.404
You were looking
for a pharmaceutical

37:30.440 --> 37:31.748
fountain of youth.

37:31.780 --> 37:33.998
A way to prolong
your perception

37:34.050 --> 37:37.019
of the time you have left
on this Earth.

37:37.050 --> 37:39.587
Weeks could feel like months--
years, even.

37:39.620 --> 37:41.554
It wouldn't be
the best of lives,

37:41.590 --> 37:43.012
but at least
you could work.

37:43.060 --> 37:45.585
Beats the grave, in any case.

37:46.790 --> 37:49.623
I'm not saying that I...

37:49.660 --> 37:52.891
have anything to do
with this trial,

37:52.930 --> 37:54.568
but what you're describing

37:54.600 --> 37:57.330
sounds incredible.

37:57.370 --> 37:59.759
It should elicit praise,

37:59.810 --> 38:02.677
not threats of arrest.

38:02.710 --> 38:06.976
We will prove that you founded
Purgatorium, Incorporated...

38:07.010 --> 38:08.841
just as we will prove
that you had

38:08.880 --> 38:10.814
surviving trial participants
executed.

38:12.950 --> 38:15.680
Admit what you did.

38:15.720 --> 38:17.415
Do it now,

38:17.460 --> 38:19.951
and we will see to your comfort

38:19.990 --> 38:22.697
in your final days.

38:24.730 --> 38:25.719
Brett...

38:28.370 --> 38:30.736
I'm tired.

38:30.770 --> 38:32.533
I'd like
to go to bed.

38:42.780 --> 38:44.714
The man's facing death.

38:44.750 --> 38:48.413
We have precious little
leverage over him.

38:48.460 --> 38:50.087
Maybe Jack Connaughton
isn't the one

38:50.120 --> 38:51.951
we should be
appealing to.

38:58.100 --> 38:59.829
BRE'I'I':
I don't know
why you asked me

38:59.870 --> 39:00.859
to come in here.

39:00.900 --> 39:02.367
I'm just a nurse.

39:02.400 --> 39:04.436
I'm not involved
in any of this.

39:04.470 --> 39:05.937
Well, in my experience,
Mr. Won,

39:05.970 --> 39:08.768
employees in the homes
of the very wealthy

39:08.810 --> 39:10.675
are often seen as little more
than sentient furniture.

39:10.710 --> 39:13.076
As such, their overseers
will often do

39:13.110 --> 39:14.941
or say things in their company

39:14.980 --> 39:17.073
they would never share
in public.

39:17.120 --> 39:18.485
You've cared for
Jack Connaughton

39:18.520 --> 39:19.487
for the last nine months.

39:19.520 --> 39:21.613
Did you hear
anything strange

39:21.660 --> 39:23.855
during that time?

39:23.890 --> 39:24.857
BELL:
Brett...

39:24.890 --> 39:26.983
people are dead.

39:28.660 --> 39:30.696
I can't talk to any of you
about this.

39:30.730 --> 39:32.027
I signed a
nondisclosure agreement

39:32.070 --> 39:33.128
when I took
this job.

39:33.170 --> 39:34.660
I could get sued.

39:34.700 --> 39:35.860
GREGSON:
There isn't an NDA

39:35.900 --> 39:38.460
on this planet
that can protect against

39:38.510 --> 39:40.501
criminal activity.

39:43.980 --> 39:46.847
BELL:
That's Marissa Ledbetter.

39:46.880 --> 39:48.871
She was a nurse, too.

39:52.190 --> 39:53.748
These are
the men

39:53.790 --> 39:55.451
that signed up for the study.

39:57.690 --> 39:59.988
Two of them
are missmg.

40:00.030 --> 40:03.056
Two of them are dead.

40:03.100 --> 40:04.988
Their families
don't have closure.

40:05.030 --> 40:07.999
You can help us
bring it to 'em.

40:18.110 --> 40:20.874
A little while back...

40:20.910 --> 40:22.616
Mr. Connaughton had me look

40:22.650 --> 40:25.084
through his safe
for a business card.

40:25.120 --> 40:27.884
When I was in the safe,
I saw a bunch of papers

40:27.920 --> 40:30.559
with the name of the business
you asked him about on them.

40:30.590 --> 40:32.581
Purgatorium, Incorporated.

40:34.030 --> 40:35.850
I found the business card.

40:35.900 --> 40:37.527
It-it didn't have
any names on it,

40:37.560 --> 40:40.028
just a phone number.

40:40.070 --> 40:43.164
He called the number,
and two men came over.

40:43.200 --> 40:44.861
They didn't introduce
themselves.

40:44.910 --> 40:48.164
They made a point of not
introducing themselves.

40:48.210 --> 40:51.771
I heard most of what
they talked about.

40:51.810 --> 40:53.243
Mr. Connaughton...

40:53.280 --> 40:56.010
mentioned these men.

40:56.050 --> 40:58.484
Said they all had to be
"taken care of."

41:10.100 --> 41:11.863
Jack Connaughton,

41:11.900 --> 41:13.026
wake up.

41:13.070 --> 41:14.697
You're under arrest.

41:22.840 --> 41:24.000
What's wrong with him?

41:30.080 --> 41:31.684
His pulse is okay.

41:31.720 --> 41:34.143
I don't think it's
from the hypertension.

41:34.190 --> 41:36.658
He's taken a dose
of Dr. Kirke's medicine.

41:36.690 --> 41:38.214
These are unlabeled,
but I'll wager

41:38.260 --> 41:39.989
they contained E-Zed-M.

41:40.030 --> 41:41.998
That drug kills people,
doesn't it?

41:42.030 --> 41:45.158
Dr. Kirke believes
it also dilates time.

41:45.200 --> 41:47.168
If Mr. Connaughton thought
he was going to be arrested

41:47.200 --> 41:51.034
for murder, why not extend
his last few hours of freedom?

41:51.070 --> 41:53.709
The most he'd have to lose
is a few weeks of life.

41:53.740 --> 41:55.731
We need EMS down here.

41:59.980 --> 42:01.675
Oh...

42:01.720 --> 42:04.018
You think his brain
is just tearing itself apart,

42:04.050 --> 42:06.939
or is he just living in there?

42:06.990 --> 42:08.241
I don't know.

42:10.260 --> 42:13.684
The best we can do is wait
for him to come around and...

42:13.730 --> 42:16.597
see how much of Jack
Connaughton is left

42:16.630 --> 42:19.019
when he does.

42:21.970 --> 42:24.131
You know, I've been thinking.

42:24.170 --> 42:26.229
If it helps to have me around,
even for a little bit,

42:26.270 --> 42:28.773
I can come back for a while.

42:28.810 --> 42:30.835
That's very kind of you, Watson.

42:32.180 --> 42:33.841
But it's a temporary malaise.

42:33.880 --> 42:35.108
It's nothing more.

42:37.220 --> 42:41.714
I will be fine.

42:41.760 --> 42:42.909
