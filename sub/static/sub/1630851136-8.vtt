broke in through my back door.</i>

00:16.391 --> 00:17.350
<i>For a guy who says</i>

00:17.392 --> 00:19.185
<i>he doesn't handle much fentanyl,</i>

00:19.227 --> 00:20.770
<i>Jackson handles
a fuckload of fentanyl.</i>

00:20.812 --> 00:23.314
<i>If I were you, I might put
a camera out back there.</i>

00:23.356 --> 00:26.359
<i>And I'll use Jackson to get
to this Bobby Jesus prick.</i>

<i>You want to find this Bobby guy

<i>You can have
two different reasons</i>

<i>-for doing the right thing.
- No.</i>

00:36.077 --> 00:37.412
<i>If it's the wrong reason,
it corrupts everything.</i>

00:37.454 --> 00:39.039
<i>The guy who named Billy
is a drug dealer?</i>

00:39.080 --> 00:42.000
<i>-Can you prove it?
- Not yet, but I'm trying.</i>

00:42.042 --> 00:43.543
<i>Don't worry.
You'll figure it out.</i>

00:43.585 --> 00:45.003
<i>We're in this together.</i>

00:45.045 --> 00:46.421
<i>Lawyer's here, Poe. Let's go.</i>

00:46.463 --> 00:47.589

I'm not interested.</i>

<i>It's Rachel.
Public defender Rachel.</i>

00:55.764 --> 00:57.932
<i>Oh. Shit. Hi.</i>

00:57.974 --> 00:59.642
<i>Your son is refusing to see me.</i>

00:59.684 --> 01:01.728
<i>I can't be his lawyer
until he signs the paper.</i>

01:01.770 --> 01:03.146
<i>I can get you in to talk to him.</i>

01:03.188 --> 01:04.230
<i>How do you know that?</i>

01:04.272 --> 01:05.857
<i>Because he's in love with me.</i>

01:05.899 --> 01:08.485
<i>I just want to know
how much he's willing to pay you</i>

01:08.526 --> 01:12.072
<i>to come here and talk us out
of what's owed to us.</i>

01:12.113 --> 01:13.073

Someone'll test you.</i>

01:18.369 --> 01:21.247
<i>Do not engage.
You hear me, Billy?</i>

01:27.212 --> 01:29.214
<i>dramatic music</i>

01:36.262 --> 01:37.806
<i>-Okay.</i>

01:39.182 --> 01:40.600
<i>What?</i>

01:40.642 --> 01:42.936
<i>Can you ask Rylan
to shut off the music?</i>

01:42.977 --> 01:44.479
<i>-Will he do that?
- He better.</i>

01:44.521 --> 01:46.231
<i>Considering what I laid out
for all this beer.</i>

01:46.272 --> 01:48.566
<i>Okay.</i>

01:48.608 --> 01:51.152
<i>-</i>

01:56.116 --> 01:57.826
<i>All right.</i>

01:59.369 --> 02:01.621
<i>Hey! Listen up, everyone!</i>

02:05.125 --> 02:07.460
<i>-Hi.</i>

02:07.502 --> 02:09.254
<i>I want to thank you all
for coming out for this.</i>

02:09.295 --> 02:10.630
<i>I hope
you're enjoying your drinks.</i>

02:10.672 --> 02:13.675
<i></i>

02:15.343 --> 02:17.971
<i>I know that some of you
are still on the fence</i>

02:18.012 --> 02:20.807
<i>about what's going on.</i>

02:20.849 --> 02:23.143
<i>Seems like
this five-letter word, union,</i>

02:23.184 --> 02:25.979
<i>has some of you thinking it's
actually a four-letter word.</i>

02:26.020 --> 02:28.815
<i>-But it's not.</i>

02:28.857 --> 02:30.650
<i>It's a good word.</i>

02:30.692 --> 02:32.277
<i>I assure you.</i>

02:32.318 --> 02:34.654
<i>And I wanted to urge all of you</i>

02:34.696 --> 02:38.825
<i>to join me in voting in favor
of unionizing tomorrow.</i>

02:38.867 --> 02:40.869
<i>We need 51%.</i>

02:40.910 --> 02:42.162
<i>Please join us.</i>

02:42.203 --> 02:45.039
<i>51% and we got ourselves
a union.</i>

02:45.081 --> 02:47.000
<i>I know, in a lot of ways,</i>

02:47.041 --> 02:49.377
<i>Mr. Gelsey has been good to us.</i>

02:49.419 --> 02:50.795
<i>-Not always.</i>

02:50.837 --> 02:53.339
<i>But most of the time.</i>

02:53.381 --> 02:55.300
<i>I've been working for him
as long as anybody here,</i>

02:55.341 --> 02:57.844
<i>and, uh, I appreciate
the steady paycheck.</i>

02:57.886 --> 02:59.512
<i>And the working conditions
aren't terrible.</i>

02:59.554 --> 03:00.555
<i>But you know what?</i>

03:00.597 --> 03:03.433
<i>"Not terrible" is not enough.</i>

03:03.474 --> 03:05.059
<i>-That's right.
- We deserve more.</i>

03:05.101 --> 03:07.187
<i>By a long shot.</i>

03:07.228 --> 03:09.647
<i>We are entitled
to medical benefits.</i>

03:09.689 --> 03:12.025
<i>We are entitled to a pension.</i>

03:12.066 --> 03:13.985
<i>And we are entitled
to proper vacation time.</i>

03:14.027 --> 03:16.863
<i>Jeanie Potts,
when your baby's born,</i>

03:16.905 --> 03:19.115
<i>you should be able
to take paid maternity leave</i>

03:19.157 --> 03:21.034
<i>and know that your job
is secure. Am I right?</i>

03:21.075 --> 03:23.536
<i>-Yeah.
- Lisa, you've been working here</i>

03:23.578 --> 03:24.829
<i>for 16 years.</i>

03:24.871 --> 03:26.623
<i>It's crazy
you don't have a pension.</i>

03:26.664 --> 03:29.542
<i>Wouldn't you like
to be able to retire at 66</i>

03:29.584 --> 03:31.377
<i>with something to fall back on?</i>

03:31.419 --> 03:32.879
<i>Or are you gonna be
hunched over that zigzag</i>

03:32.921 --> 03:34.214
<i>for the rest of your life,
hemming dresses</i>

03:34.255 --> 03:35.715
<i>until you're
in your frickin' 70s?</i>

03:35.757 --> 03:37.383
<i>-Look, I've been sewing lace</i>

03:37.425 --> 03:39.469
<i>onto dresses since...</i>

03:41.054 --> 03:42.889
<i>....as long as my son's
been alive.</i>

03:42.931 --> 03:45.058
<i>And I am proud of that work.</i>

03:45.099 --> 03:47.560
<i>Yeah. That's right. Yeah.</i>

03:47.602 --> 03:49.729
<i>We make damn good dresses
at Gelsey's.</i>

03:49.771 --> 03:51.648
<i>-Yeah.
<i>-Hear, hear.</i></i>

03:52.607 --> 03:54.234
<i>Ladies,</i>

03:54.275 --> 03:56.611
<i>these are basic,</i>

03:56.653 --> 04:00.323
<i>fundamental workers' rights
we're asking for.</i>

04:00.365 --> 04:01.741
<i>Yep.</i>

04:01.783 --> 04:04.244
<i>Please stand in solidarity
with me tomorrow</i>

04:04.285 --> 04:07.038
<i>and cast your vote
for unionization.</i>

04:08.248 --> 04:11.042
<i>Let's take control of our lives
for once.</i>

04:11.084 --> 04:12.752
<i></i>

04:17.298 --> 04:19.050
<i>Don't lean on the fence.</i>

04:19.092 --> 04:20.969
<i>It's a good way to get shanked.</i>

04:29.477 --> 04:31.104
<i>Hey.</i>

04:32.272 --> 04:34.440
<i>It's Bill, right?</i>

04:34.482 --> 04:35.942
<i>-Billy.
- Billy.</i>

04:35.984 --> 04:38.027
<i>My bad. I'm Jerry.</i>

04:38.069 --> 04:39.904
<i>I came to let you know
you're welcome</i>

04:39.946 --> 04:41.948
<i>to come over and use
the fitness equipment.</i>

04:46.577 --> 04:48.454
<i>Don't worry.
No one's gonna hurt you.</i>

04:48.496 --> 04:49.664
<i>Dealer's choice.</i>

04:49.706 --> 04:52.250
<i>You got the pull-up bar,
the bench</i>

04:52.292 --> 04:53.710
<i>and a whole rack of dumbbells.</i>

04:56.796 --> 04:57.964
<i>I'll go bench.</i>

04:58.006 --> 04:59.465
<i>All right. Come on.</i>

05:03.469 --> 05:05.471
<i>It's all yours.</i>

05:09.183 --> 05:10.226
<i>I'll spot you.</i>

05:10.268 --> 05:12.270
<i>-I got it.
- Mm.</i>

05:31.789 --> 05:34.792
<i>You did good the other night.</i>

05:34.834 --> 05:37.837
<i>Not a lot of guys could handle
themselves the way you did.</i>

05:37.879 --> 05:40.798
<i>You strike hard, quick.</i>

05:40.840 --> 05:43.593
<i>You can take a hit.</i>

05:43.634 --> 05:46.012
<i>I'm Milo, by the way.</i>

05:48.848 --> 05:50.600
<i>It's Billy, right?</i>

05:52.727 --> 05:54.812
<i>low, ominous music</i>

06:17.210 --> 06:19.045
<i>Here's his personal items</i>

06:19.087 --> 06:20.630
<i>-and the goods.
Copy that.</i>

06:20.671 --> 06:21.923
<i>Thanks, Steve.</i>

06:21.964 --> 06:23.716
<i>-Chief.
- Hey.</i>

06:31.265 --> 06:33.434
<i>Could I see you in my office?</i>

06:42.944 --> 06:45.405
<i>You mind telling me
what the fuck's going on here?</i>

06:45.446 --> 06:47.240
<i>Offinger caught the guy dealing</i>

06:47.281 --> 06:49.659
<i>to a couple of construction
workers over on Swan Boulevard</i>

06:49.700 --> 06:50.743
<i>and called for backup.</i>

06:50.785 --> 06:52.245
<i>We apprehended him</i>

06:52.286 --> 06:53.579
<i>just before he reached
the outskirts of town</i>

06:53.621 --> 06:55.081
<i>and brought him in
to the station.</i>

06:55.123 --> 06:56.666
<i>So who called Deluca?</i>

06:56.707 --> 06:57.667
<i>I did.</i>

06:57.708 --> 06:59.544
<i>Why?</i>

06:59.585 --> 07:00.461
<i>Because it's related
to his case.</i>

07:00.503 --> 07:01.504
<i>Trent Tisdell</i>

07:01.546 --> 07:02.630
<i>overdosed in Buell,</i>

07:02.672 --> 07:04.090
<i>which is my jurisdiction.</i>

07:04.132 --> 07:06.008
<i>-Your jurisdiction?
- Our jurisdiction.</i>

07:06.050 --> 07:07.635
<i>Buell fucking Township.</i>

07:07.677 --> 07:08.970
<i>It's not Deluca's case.</i>

07:09.011 --> 07:10.346
<i>But everyone knows</i>

07:10.388 --> 07:12.056
<i>the perp is linked
to that Bobby guy.</i>

07:12.098 --> 07:13.391
<i>Based on what evidence?</i>

07:13.433 --> 07:14.934
<i>Based on the fact
that he was dealing</i>

07:14.976 --> 07:16.936
<i>the exact same baggies of coke,</i>

07:16.978 --> 07:19.480
<i>which likely contained
the exact same contents.</i>

07:19.522 --> 07:22.608
<i>Just because the baggies are the
same fucking brand from Costco</i>

07:22.650 --> 07:24.444
<i>doesn't confirm anything.</i>

07:24.485 --> 07:27.321
<i>Every goddamn drug dealer from
here to Boise fucking Idaho</i>

07:27.363 --> 07:28.739
<i>uses those baggies.</i>

07:28.781 --> 07:30.658
<i>They haven't even sent his stash
to the lab</i>

07:30.700 --> 07:32.076
<i>for testing yet.</i>

07:32.118 --> 07:34.078
<i>Look,
you're not on that case, Chief.</i>

07:36.456 --> 07:38.291
<i>Can I ask you a question, Park?</i>

07:38.332 --> 07:39.959
<i>Very basic question.</i>

07:40.001 --> 07:42.253
<i>Of course.</i>

07:42.295 --> 07:45.131
<i>Whose fucking side are you on?</i>

08:17.246 --> 08:19.540
<i>The guard standing over
by the food line.</i>

08:19.582 --> 08:20.791
<i>Brown eyes, goatee.</i>

08:22.251 --> 08:23.503
<i>Don't look.</i>

08:24.420 --> 08:26.506
<i>Do you know
who I'm talking about?</i>

08:29.217 --> 08:30.551
<i>Tomorrow,</i>

08:30.593 --> 08:33.304
<i>during the second
mess shift change,</i>

08:33.346 --> 08:35.389
<i>in the hall connecting
that entrance over there</i>

08:35.431 --> 08:37.558
<i>to our cell block--</i>

08:37.600 --> 08:39.185
<i>Look at it.</i>

08:40.186 --> 08:41.687
<i>By the clock.</i>

08:42.647 --> 08:44.565
<i>Got it?</i>

08:46.067 --> 08:48.027
<i>Down that hallway,</i>

08:48.069 --> 08:50.404
<i>that's where
you're gonna take him out.</i>

08:53.991 --> 08:57.036
<i>A necessary item
will be provided to you.</i>

08:57.078 --> 08:59.789
<i>It'll be
approximately four inches long</i>

08:59.830 --> 09:02.291
<i>and plenty sharp.</i>

09:02.333 --> 09:04.377
<i>I'd advise going for the throat.</i>

09:07.338 --> 09:10.716
<i>He needs to cease existing.</i>

09:12.051 --> 09:13.719
<i>What did he do?</i>

09:15.346 --> 09:18.057
<i>Not what he was supposed to.</i>

09:18.099 --> 09:21.060
<i>low, tense music</i>

09:23.646 --> 09:26.857
<i>Nod twice to let me know
you understand your mission.</i>

09:32.863 --> 09:34.490
<i>Good.</i>

09:59.724 --> 10:01.934
<i>- Oh, my friend</i>

10:01.976 --> 10:03.603
<i>- We have reached</i>

10:03.644 --> 10:05.605
<i>- The end...</i>
<i></i>

10:05.646 --> 10:06.939
<i>How you feeling?</i>

10:06.981 --> 10:09.609
<i>I've been better.</i>

10:09.650 --> 10:12.278
<i>You've been asleep for 20 hours.</i>

10:12.320 --> 10:15.114
<i>You should drink some water.</i>

10:15.156 --> 10:17.408
<i>I left some Advil there for you.</i>

10:17.450 --> 10:19.619
<i>I'm told you can take
up to six at a time.</i>

10:19.660 --> 10:23.456
<i>When all my roads are ending</i>

10:25.666 --> 10:27.960
<i>You mind me asking
what happened to you?</i>

10:28.002 --> 10:29.128
<i>Run</i>

10:29.170 --> 10:31.964
<i>It isn't you</i>

10:32.006 --> 10:34.467
<i>- I'm running from</i>

10:34.508 --> 10:37.136
<i>And after all this,
I still...</i>

10:37.178 --> 10:38.804
<i>I paid for all that.</i>

10:38.846 --> 10:40.640
<i>So you're welcome to it.</i>

10:40.681 --> 10:42.600
<i>If you're looking for something
a bit more nutritious,</i>

10:42.642 --> 10:44.185
<i>there's an entire
Tupperware container</i>

10:44.226 --> 10:46.270
<i>of leftover chicken soup
in the fridge.</i>

10:46.312 --> 10:49.023
<i>Feel free to heat it up
in the microwave.</i>

10:52.068 --> 10:54.528
<i>I washed your jacket.</i>

10:54.570 --> 10:56.822
<i>I couldn't get
all the spray paint out.</i>

10:56.864 --> 11:00.076
<i>Might need to take
some turpentine to it.</i>

11:00.117 --> 11:02.078
<i>I left some fresh towels
and clean clothes for you</i>

11:02.119 --> 11:03.663
<i>in the bathroom.</i>

11:03.704 --> 11:06.999
<i>Hot water takes
about ten seconds to kick in.</i>

11:07.041 --> 11:08.334
<i>Call your bluff</i>

11:08.376 --> 11:11.671
<i>It reminds me of</i>

11:11.712 --> 11:14.924
<i>An ocean caught between us</i>

11:17.635 --> 11:21.764
<i>So, I got 200 bucks
in this shoebox.</i>

11:21.806 --> 11:24.892
<i>I keep it up on the shelf
in the closet in my bedroom.</i>

11:25.476 --> 11:27.478
<i>And there's a Blu-ray player
right over there,</i>

11:27.520 --> 11:28.896
<i>but that's about it.</i>

11:29.939 --> 11:31.482
<i>TV's a piece of shit.</i>

11:31.524 --> 11:34.026
<i>In case you were planning
to rob me.</i>

11:34.068 --> 11:36.654
<i>I'm not gonna rob you.</i>

11:45.037 --> 11:46.997
<i>Okay, then.</i>

11:57.758 --> 11:59.719
<i>gentle, contemplative music</i>

12:48.267 --> 12:49.727
<i>Hey, Ma.</i>

12:51.270 --> 12:53.606
<i>What have they done to you?</i>

12:55.107 --> 12:57.735
<i>-I got in a fight.
- You got in a fight?</i>

13:00.321 --> 13:03.282
<i>Already? I mean, what happened?</i>

13:06.660 --> 13:08.704
<i>In the shower.</i>

13:11.999 --> 13:14.543
<i>It was no big deal.</i>

13:15.503 --> 13:16.962
<i>I am sitting here,</i>

13:17.004 --> 13:18.881
<i>looking at your face.</i>

13:20.132 --> 13:22.635
<i>How can you tell me
it's no big deal?</i>

13:22.676 --> 13:24.470
<i>No contact.</i>

13:24.512 --> 13:26.055
<i>Sorry.</i>

13:31.435 --> 13:32.728
<i>Did you see a doctor?</i>

13:32.770 --> 13:35.147
<i>I don't need a doctor, Ma.</i>

13:41.403 --> 13:42.863
<i>How are your hands?</i>

13:42.905 --> 13:44.448
<i>I don't give a shit
about my hands right now.</i>

13:44.490 --> 13:47.827
<i>Are you sure
you don't need to see a doctor?</i>

13:49.578 --> 13:51.831
<i>I've been hit harder
playing football.</i>

13:51.872 --> 13:53.791
<i>Trust me,</i>

13:53.833 --> 13:55.543
<i>I'll be okay.</i>

14:01.382 --> 14:03.676
<i>Tell me what's going on.</i>

14:07.346 --> 14:09.890
<i>Everything's fine, Ma.</i>

14:09.932 --> 14:12.226
<i>I promise.</i>

14:13.561 --> 14:15.980
<i>I just had a little fight.</i>

14:17.857 --> 14:19.733
<i>It's over.</i>

14:24.738 --> 14:26.699
<i>Okay.</i>

14:26.740 --> 14:28.993
<i>I don't got a lot of time,</i>

14:29.034 --> 14:31.704
<i>so I need to ask you something.</i>

14:31.745 --> 14:34.665
<i>And I need you
to be honest with me.</i>

14:34.707 --> 14:36.625
<i>Okay.</i>

14:36.667 --> 14:38.961
<i>Why aren't you talking
to Rachel?</i>

14:43.090 --> 14:44.884
<i>Do you not trust her?</i>

14:47.887 --> 14:50.389
<i>If we have any chance
of getting you out of here,</i>

14:50.431 --> 14:52.391
<i>you have to engage with her.</i>

14:52.433 --> 14:53.726
<i>Do you understand that?</i>

14:53.767 --> 14:55.352
<i>She wants to help you.</i>

14:55.394 --> 14:57.438
<i>But she can't
if you won't let her.</i>

14:57.479 --> 14:59.273
<i>Sorry.</i>

15:02.318 --> 15:04.737
<i>Can you at least promise me
that you'll see her again?</i>

15:04.778 --> 15:06.405
<i>Can you promise me that?</i>

15:10.743 --> 15:12.369
<i>Say it.</i>

15:15.205 --> 15:17.541
<i>I promise you
I'll see her again.</i>

15:17.583 --> 15:19.543
<i>soft, somber music</i>

15:27.468 --> 15:30.429
<i></i>

15:33.057 --> 15:34.266
<i>The Trent Tisdell overdose</i>

15:34.308 --> 15:36.226
<i>happened in my jurisdiction, Frank.</i>

15:36.268 --> 15:38.103
<i>I'm not sure
what you're concerned about.</i>

15:38.145 --> 15:40.439
<i>I'm concerned
how your handling of this guy</i>

15:40.481 --> 15:42.566
<i>might affect
whatever syndicate led the drugs</i>

15:42.608 --> 15:44.401
<i>to that house party in Buell.</i>

15:44.443 --> 15:47.112
<i>You nab one tomcat
and all the other cats scramble.</i>

15:47.154 --> 15:49.615
<i>Now, what's this guy
actually giving you?</i>

15:49.657 --> 15:50.741
<i>He's giving us a lot.</i>

15:50.783 --> 15:52.117
<i>A lot for what case?</i>

15:52.159 --> 15:53.953
<i>The drugs
in Trent Tisdell's tox screen</i>

15:53.994 --> 15:56.288
<i>were a direct match
with the couple who OD'd</i>

15:56.330 --> 15:57.289
<i>at that Little League game.</i>

15:57.331 --> 15:59.291
<i>Melanie and Tom Bayer.</i>

15:59.333 --> 16:00.626
<i>Also my jurisdiction.</i>

16:00.668 --> 16:01.585
<i>Goddamn it!</i>

16:01.627 --> 16:02.711
<i>-Del.
- What?!</i>

16:02.753 --> 16:03.754
<i>Sit down.</i>

16:22.147 --> 16:23.691
<i>And calm down.</i>

16:29.321 --> 16:30.906
<i>-You calm?
- I'm calm.</i>

16:30.948 --> 16:31.949
<i>Good.</i>

16:31.991 --> 16:33.742
<i>Now listen to me.</i>

16:35.285 --> 16:37.496
<i>-I'm listening.
- Sue Herlitz is willing</i>

16:37.538 --> 16:40.499
<i>to cut this guy a deal
if he can give us any intel,</i>

16:40.541 --> 16:42.418
<i>anything to help track
this line of traffic back</i>

16:42.459 --> 16:44.461
<i>to our Bobby Jesus character.</i>

16:54.805 --> 16:57.474
<i>You knocking on doors
for her, too?</i>

16:57.516 --> 16:59.977
<i>You'd think she was running
for attorney general.</i>

17:00.019 --> 17:02.062
<i>Look, Del,
if this guy reveals anything</i>

17:02.104 --> 17:05.190
<i>that might relate
to Tisdell's overdose,</i>

17:05.232 --> 17:07.860
<i>I promise you,
you'll be the first one to know.</i>

17:10.988 --> 17:13.866
<i>It's not that I'm afraid</i>

17:16.827 --> 17:19.538
<i>- Of the houses in the deep</i>

17:23.417 --> 17:25.836
<i>It's just I know your name</i>

17:27.463 --> 17:30.466
<i>They call</i>

17:30.507 --> 17:32.926
<i>You the Beast</i>

17:34.511 --> 17:37.556
<i>Do, do, do, do, do, do, do</i>

17:43.270 --> 17:46.023
<i>-Excuse me, sir.
- Please keep your distance.</i>

17:46.065 --> 17:47.733
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

17:47.775 --> 17:49.735
<i>Talk to me.</i>

17:51.278 --> 17:53.822
<i>An inmate told me
I had to take out another guard.</i>

17:55.074 --> 17:57.159
<i>I-I need to be transferred.</i>

17:58.118 --> 17:59.453
<i>Can you help me?</i>

18:02.748 --> 18:04.458
<i>You did the right thing.</i>

18:04.500 --> 18:06.335
<i>Come with me.</i>

18:14.093 --> 18:16.053
<i>low, ominous music</i>

18:17.805 --> 18:19.223
<i>I'm glad you came to me.</i>

18:19.264 --> 18:20.974
<i>That took a lot of guts.</i>

18:25.229 --> 18:27.439
<i>Approach the urinal.</i>

18:28.398 --> 18:29.733
<i>Why?</i>

18:29.775 --> 18:32.319
<i>Because there's something
in there for you.</i>

18:41.578 --> 18:43.288
<i>Reach inside.</i>

18:51.797 --> 18:54.174
<i>Now drop it in the toilet.</i>

19:01.515 --> 19:03.559
<i>I'd go in after it
if I were you.</i>

19:13.068 --> 19:16.238
<i>That should help you
carry out your mission.</i>

19:24.246 --> 19:25.831
<i>After the glow</i>

19:25.873 --> 19:27.499
<i>You're still here.</i>

19:27.541 --> 19:29.334
<i>The sad talk</i>

19:29.376 --> 19:31.962
<i>I thought
you'd be long gone by now.</i>

19:32.004 --> 19:34.339
<i>I'll never forget</i>

19:34.381 --> 19:35.799
<i>Hey, you got to pay...</i>

19:35.841 --> 19:37.676
<i>So what'd you do all day?</i>

19:37.718 --> 19:39.386
<i>Slept, mostly.</i>

19:39.428 --> 19:40.888
<i>Looks like you had a shower.</i>

19:40.929 --> 19:42.389
<i>-Was the water okay?
- Yeah.</i>

19:42.431 --> 19:45.100
<i>-It was perfect.
- Did you eat?</i>

19:45.142 --> 19:47.269
<i>I had that chicken soup.</i>

19:47.311 --> 19:48.437
<i>It's good, right?</i>

19:48.478 --> 19:50.147
<i>Yeah. It's good.</i>

19:50.189 --> 19:53.525
<i>Right or wrong,
it's all that I can do</i>

19:53.567 --> 19:57.779
<i>And I wouldn't want
to let you be</i>

19:57.821 --> 20:02.034
<i>I want a range life</i>

20:02.075 --> 20:04.995
<i>If I could settle down</i>

20:05.037 --> 20:07.372
<i>Why are you being so nice to me?</i>

20:07.414 --> 20:10.042
<i>- If I could settle down</i>
<i></i>

20:10.083 --> 20:11.835
<i>Then I would settle...</i>

20:11.877 --> 20:13.212
<i>See these?</i>

20:13.253 --> 20:14.880
<i>They're all fake.</i>

20:14.922 --> 20:16.340
<i>These six.</i>

20:16.381 --> 20:18.508
<i>Range life</i>

20:18.550 --> 20:19.885
<i>About six months ago,</i>

20:19.927 --> 20:21.720
<i>I was coming out of work,</i>

20:21.762 --> 20:24.431
<i>walking to my car
in the parking lot,</i>

20:24.473 --> 20:27.184
<i>and this guy jumps me
with a baseball bat.</i>

20:27.226 --> 20:28.727
<i>Knocked out my teeth.</i>

20:28.769 --> 20:31.063
<i>Broke my nose.
Busted my collarbone.</i>

20:31.104 --> 20:33.357
<i>Cracked three ribs.</i>

20:33.398 --> 20:35.025
<i>Turns out,</i>

20:35.067 --> 20:36.777
<i>he had mistook me
for this other guy</i>

20:36.818 --> 20:39.238
<i>who was fucking his wife.</i>

20:40.489 --> 20:42.407
<i>I spent three days in the ICU.</i>

20:42.449 --> 20:43.951
<i>Took me over a month</i>

20:43.992 --> 20:46.745
<i>before I was able
to raise my arms above my head.</i>

20:49.581 --> 20:51.959
<i>But my point is,
when it comes to recognizing</i>

20:52.000 --> 20:55.462
<i>someone else
who's been through something...</i>

20:55.504 --> 20:57.756
<i>it's like I've developed
superpowers.</i>

20:57.798 --> 21:00.926
<i>You had that look.</i>

21:00.968 --> 21:03.262
<i>Something bad happened to you.</i>

21:03.303 --> 21:05.764
<i>This crime,
it is never complete</i>

21:05.806 --> 21:09.101
<i>Plus, what they spray-painted
on the back of your jacket.</i>

21:09.142 --> 21:12.980
<i>You're never gonna feel free</i>

21:14.147 --> 21:16.608
<i>Um...</i>

21:16.650 --> 21:18.694
<i>I don't even know where I am.</i>

21:18.735 --> 21:19.778
<i>You're in Chadron.</i>

21:19.820 --> 21:21.738
<i>Chadron, Nebraska.</i>

21:21.780 --> 21:23.448
<i>Northwest corner of the state.</i>

21:23.490 --> 21:25.450
<i>We're about 15 miles
below South Dakota,</i>

21:25.492 --> 21:26.868
<i>a few hours east of Wyoming.</i>

21:26.910 --> 21:30.122
<i>No one but myself to blame</i>

21:31.373 --> 21:33.333
<i>Don't worry</i>

21:33.375 --> 21:36.920
<i>We're in no hurry</i>

21:39.172 --> 21:41.174
<i>So how many of them were there?</i>

21:41.216 --> 21:43.343
<i>What did you expect?</i>

21:43.385 --> 21:46.096
<i>Two or... three. Maybe four.</i>

21:47.055 --> 21:48.432
<i>Never actually saw them.</i>

21:49.057 --> 21:52.936
<i>They hit me pretty hard
from behind, and I went down.</i>

21:54.521 --> 21:57.149
<i>I just remember
feeling their boots</i>

21:57.190 --> 22:00.193
<i>blasting into my ribs
and my face,</i>

22:00.235 --> 22:02.154
<i>my shoulder blades.</i>

22:05.324 --> 22:07.868
<i>Then they took my backpack
and ran off.</i>

22:09.328 --> 22:11.747
<i>From the looks of it,
they got you pretty good.</i>

22:12.789 --> 22:16.460
<i>If I could settle down</i>

22:16.501 --> 22:18.086
<i>I'm starting to think I'm...</i>

22:18.128 --> 22:20.547
<i>the kind of person
bad things happen to.</i>

22:21.548 --> 22:23.508
<i>I think I know how you feel.</i>

22:38.565 --> 22:41.818
<i>Hopefully things
will turn around for you.</i>

22:45.238 --> 22:47.199
<i>The pinewood derby's finest.</i>

22:49.868 --> 22:51.536
<i>That's some bowl.</i>

22:51.578 --> 22:53.705
<i>It's a magic bowl.</i>

22:53.747 --> 22:55.916
<i>- I don't understand</i>

22:55.957 --> 22:57.542
<i>What they mean</i>

22:57.584 --> 23:01.505
<i>And I could really give
a fuck</i>

23:02.464 --> 23:04.383
<i>Stone Temple Pilots</i>

23:04.424 --> 23:06.510
<i>They're elegant bachelors</i>

23:06.551 --> 23:07.969
<i>They're foxy to me</i>

23:08.011 --> 23:10.639
<i>Are they foxy to you?</i>

23:10.680 --> 23:12.641
<i>You happen to be in the presence</i>

23:12.682 --> 23:16.895
<i>of the 1995 pinewood derby champ
of Beatrice, Nebraska.</i>

23:22.067 --> 23:23.568
<i>Dream, dream, dream</i>

23:23.610 --> 23:25.404
<i>Lights out in the gallery.</i>

23:29.616 --> 23:31.576
<i>soft, haunting music</i>

23:46.758 --> 23:49.136
<i>The new phone book's here!
The new phone book's here!</i>

23:49.177 --> 23:51.471
<i>[Harry]</i> <i>Well, I wish I could
get that excited about nothing.</i>

23:51.513 --> 23:53.140
<i>Nothing?! Are you kidding?!</i>

23:53.181 --> 23:55.100
<i>Page 73!</i>

23:55.142 --> 23:58.103
<i>"Johnson, Navin R."!</i>

23:58.145 --> 23:59.771
<i>I'm somebody now!</i>

23:59.813 --> 24:02.607
<i>Millions of people look
at this book every day!</i>

24:06.278 --> 24:08.071
<i>Here's to small victories.</i>

24:23.253 --> 24:27.132
<i>"What victories?" he's thinking,
as he drinks his lady's bourbon.</i>

24:33.138 --> 24:35.640
<i>I convinced Billy
to meet with his lawyer again.</i>

24:42.606 --> 24:44.399
<i>Gave a bona fide speech
last night.</i>

24:44.441 --> 24:46.985
<i>Stood on a chair in front
of a gathering of my coworkers.</i>

24:47.027 --> 24:49.321
<i>I think it went pretty well.
We might have a...</i>

24:49.362 --> 24:51.656
<i>a legitimate shot
at this union thing.</i>

24:54.326 --> 24:56.077
<i>Good for you, Grace.</i>

24:57.037 --> 24:58.580
<i>What is going on?</i>

25:00.499 --> 25:02.626
<i>Did something happen?</i>

25:04.753 --> 25:07.130
<i>The county sheriff's office
brought in this guy</i>

25:07.172 --> 25:08.840
<i>for questioning today.</i>

25:10.008 --> 25:11.843
<i>He was dealing
from the same batch</i>

25:11.885 --> 25:14.471
<i>as our Bobby Jesus character.</i>

25:15.639 --> 25:18.266
<i>So, it's only a matter of time</i>

25:18.308 --> 25:20.519
<i>before they connect the dots.</i>

25:20.560 --> 25:24.022
<i>If Herlitz and Deluca
get to him first...</i>

25:24.064 --> 25:26.024
<i>They'll protect him.</i>

25:26.066 --> 25:28.318
<i>Oh, they'll more
than protect him.</i>

25:28.360 --> 25:32.030
<i>They'll rehab his reputation
till he goes on the stand and...</i>

25:32.072 --> 25:34.032
<i>names Billy.</i>

25:34.074 --> 25:36.409
<i>That'll be that.</i>

25:38.245 --> 25:40.288
<i>Even if I go pick him up first.</i>

25:40.330 --> 25:41.623
<i>Same result.</i>

25:41.665 --> 25:43.708
<i>Exactly.</i>

25:43.750 --> 25:45.710
<i>low, tense music</i>

25:48.380 --> 25:50.924
<i>Okay. Um...</i>

25:53.927 --> 25:55.512
<i>Okay.</i>

25:55.554 --> 25:58.056
<i>So what can we do?</i>

25:58.098 --> 25:59.057
<i>We?</i>

25:59.099 --> 26:01.226
<i>You know what I mean.</i>

26:01.268 --> 26:03.019
<i>What do you need from me?</i>

26:03.061 --> 26:05.230
<i>I didn't realize that my needs</i>

26:05.272 --> 26:06.982
<i>were suddenly
under consideration.</i>

26:07.023 --> 26:08.358
<i>Oh, come on, Del.</i>

26:09.693 --> 26:11.361
<i>Seriously.</i>

26:14.197 --> 26:15.574
<i>I'm gonna go.</i>

26:15.615 --> 26:16.783
<i>No.</i>

26:17.742 --> 26:19.077
<i>Stay.</i>

26:20.370 --> 26:23.248
<i>You don't really need me here.</i>

26:29.629 --> 26:31.590
<i>Why would you say that?</i>

26:32.882 --> 26:34.718
<i>Del.</i>

26:39.431 --> 26:41.725
<i></i>

26:47.772 --> 26:51.860
<i>For your own protection</i>

26:51.901 --> 26:54.863
<i>Over their affection</i>

26:54.904 --> 26:57.616
<i>Nobody broke your heart</i>

27:04.414 --> 27:06.041
<i>Finish what you start</i>

27:06.082 --> 27:08.418
<i>Walk down Alameda</i>

27:08.460 --> 27:10.629
<i>Brushing off the nightmares</i>

27:10.670 --> 27:13.423
<i>You wish could plague me</i>

27:13.465 --> 27:16.217
<i>When I'm awake</i>

27:16.259 --> 27:18.136
<i>So now you see</i>

27:18.178 --> 27:22.807
<i>Your first mistake</i>

27:23.767 --> 27:25.393
<i>Was thinking</i>

27:25.435 --> 27:29.230
<i>That you could relate</i>

27:29.272 --> 27:32.192
<i>For one or two</i>

27:32.233 --> 27:35.320
<i>-Do you want to?</i>

27:35.362 --> 27:38.114
<i>-You sure?</i>

27:38.156 --> 27:43.203
<i>In</i>

28:03.598 --> 28:07.644
<i>You're all pretension</i>

28:07.686 --> 28:09.938
<i>I never pay attention</i>

28:09.979 --> 28:14.484
<i>Nobody broke your heart</i>

28:15.443 --> 28:17.404
<i>low, sinister music</i>

28:49.769 --> 28:51.062
<i>low, tense music</i>

28:56.276 --> 28:58.278
<i></i>

29:05.952 --> 29:07.912
<i>-What the fuck?</i>

29:07.954 --> 29:10.415
<i>Come here, you motherfucker.</i>

29:17.547 --> 29:20.008
<i>Code two! Code two!
South corridor!</i>

29:20.049 --> 29:22.135
<i>-Stay down.</i>

29:22.177 --> 29:24.596
<i>Tell me about your necklace.</i>

29:24.637 --> 29:27.140
<i>It's St. Sebastian.</i>

29:27.182 --> 29:30.685
<i>He's the patron saint
of athletes or...</i>

29:30.727 --> 29:32.896
<i>archers or something like that.</i>

29:33.855 --> 29:35.857
<i>Legend has it
he was tied to a tree</i>

29:35.899 --> 29:38.943
<i>and shot with arrows during
the Roman emperor's persecution</i>

29:38.985 --> 29:40.195
<i>of the Christians.</i>

29:40.236 --> 29:42.322
<i>Somehow the arrows
didn't kill him,</i>

29:42.363 --> 29:45.408
<i>and he was rescued
by St. Irene of Rome.</i>

29:47.577 --> 29:49.120
<i>And she nursed him back
to health.</i>

29:51.289 --> 29:53.792
<i>But shortly after that,
he was clubbed to death anyway.</i>

29:53.833 --> 29:55.627
<i>-Yikes.</i>

29:55.668 --> 29:57.712
<i>-Rough life.</i>

29:59.506 --> 30:02.425
<i>My mother gave it to me.</i>

30:02.467 --> 30:04.052
<i>It was hers.</i>

30:05.345 --> 30:09.307
<i>I think something about
his martyrdom spoke to her.</i>

30:12.185 --> 30:14.646
<i>Does your mother know
where you are?</i>

30:15.605 --> 30:17.232
<i>No.</i>

30:17.273 --> 30:19.818
<i>She must be worried sick.</i>

30:21.736 --> 30:23.488
<i>You might want
to give her a call,</i>

30:23.530 --> 30:25.865
<i>just to let her know
you're okay.</i>

30:29.202 --> 30:31.079
<i>My mom's dead, Nate.</i>

30:33.081 --> 30:34.791
<i>Oh.</i>

30:36.000 --> 30:38.253
<i>She passed away a few years ago.</i>

30:40.380 --> 30:43.174
<i>Isaac, I'm sorry.</i>

30:45.051 --> 30:46.511
<i>Were you close?</i>

30:50.181 --> 30:52.225
<i>How about your dad?</i>

30:53.518 --> 30:55.353
<i>He's still around.</i>

30:55.395 --> 30:57.897
<i>He's turning into the kind
of person you can talk about</i>

30:57.939 --> 31:00.525
<i>when they're right there
in the room with you.</i>

31:02.360 --> 31:05.029
<i>He's a checked-out,
bitter old man.</i>

31:08.157 --> 31:10.827
<i>Do you think your mother knew?</i>

31:10.869 --> 31:12.453
<i>About you?</i>

31:17.083 --> 31:19.711
<i>They always know, Isaac.</i>

31:21.921 --> 31:24.716
<i>Maybe that's why she gave you
this necklace.</i>

31:25.758 --> 31:29.888
<i>She knew
St. Sebastian would protect you.</i>

31:45.445 --> 31:47.530
<i>Open number nine.</i>

31:54.829 --> 31:57.373
<i>Picked the wrong group
to fuck with, Poe.</i>

31:57.415 --> 32:00.168
<i>Good luck with the Aryans
when you get out of here.</i>

32:01.961 --> 32:04.088
<i>Close nine.</i>

32:04.130 --> 32:06.591
<i>gentle, melancholy music</i>

32:21.648 --> 32:23.066
<i>There you go.</i>

32:23.107 --> 32:24.776
<i>Nice clear mark
on the ballot, please.</i>

32:36.663 --> 32:38.331
<i>Open nine.</i>

32:38.373 --> 32:39.874
<i></i>

32:42.001 --> 32:44.629
<i>Your lawyer, Rachel Walton,
is here to see you.</i>

33:00.019 --> 33:01.437
<i>Hey.</i>

33:02.313 --> 33:04.357
<i>Hey.</i>

33:06.776 --> 33:08.277
<i>How are you?</i>

33:08.319 --> 33:09.612
<i>Good.</i>

33:09.654 --> 33:11.698
<i>I'm good.</i>

33:13.032 --> 33:14.575
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

33:14.617 --> 33:16.119
<i>Your dad okay?</i>

33:16.160 --> 33:19.414
<i>-Everything's fine.
- Take a seat, Billy.</i>

33:24.961 --> 33:27.505
<i></i>

33:29.716 --> 33:32.093
<i>How are you doing?</i>

33:32.135 --> 33:34.262
<i>-I'm okay.
- I understand</i>

33:34.303 --> 33:36.180
<i>from your mom
that you got in a fight.</i>

33:36.222 --> 33:38.808
<i>Yeah, one fight.
It's no big deal.</i>

33:38.850 --> 33:41.310
<i>And the warden just informed me
that you wound up</i>

33:41.352 --> 33:44.230
<i>in solitary confinement for
accosting two fellow inmates.</i>

33:44.272 --> 33:46.816
<i>So there were two fights.</i>

33:46.858 --> 33:49.652
<i>Do you want to tell
me what happened?</i>

33:51.946 --> 33:53.906
<i>The first one was sort of, um...</i>

33:53.948 --> 33:55.867
<i>an initiation thing.</i>

33:55.908 --> 33:57.326
<i>Mm.</i>

33:57.368 --> 33:59.203
<i>I had no choice
about the second one.</i>

33:59.245 --> 34:00.496
<i>I'll just leave it at that.</i>

34:01.914 --> 34:03.374
<i>All this fighting is not going</i>

34:03.416 --> 34:04.959
<i>to look good
to the D.A.'s office.</i>

34:05.001 --> 34:07.170
<i>They will try and use it
against you at your trial.</i>

34:07.211 --> 34:08.588
<i>I hope you realize that.</i>

34:09.881 --> 34:12.884
<i>Your mom also told me
you're ready to talk to me.</i>

34:14.010 --> 34:16.220
<i>-I'm open to it.
- Good.</i>

34:19.849 --> 34:23.394
<i>So, let's talk about what
happened at the steel mill.</i>

34:23.436 --> 34:25.730
<i>According to Sheriff Deluca,
the anonymous source</i>

34:25.772 --> 34:27.815
<i>who named you
described you in detail.</i>

34:27.857 --> 34:29.817
<i>He said you accosted
Pete Novick,</i>

34:29.859 --> 34:31.360
<i>that you "coldcocked him,"</i>

34:31.402 --> 34:33.446
<i>and that there was blood.</i>

34:36.866 --> 34:39.077
<i>So were you there?</i>

34:49.796 --> 34:51.756
<i>quiet, tense music</i>

34:53.758 --> 34:55.259
<i>Billy...</i>

34:55.301 --> 34:58.805
<i>whatever you are going to say,
please say it.</i>

35:08.064 --> 35:09.982
<i>Billy, I can't help you
unless you talk to me.</i>

35:10.024 --> 35:12.735
<i>Please, let me help you.</i>

35:16.197 --> 35:18.699
<i>Was there anyone else there
besides you,</i>

35:18.741 --> 35:21.494
<i>Pete Novick and the other guy
who made the anonymous call?</i>

35:27.458 --> 35:29.752
<i>If someone else was with you</i>

35:29.794 --> 35:33.047
<i>in that steel mill,
now is the time to tell me.</i>

35:45.268 --> 35:47.603
<i>Billy, this may be</i>

35:47.645 --> 35:50.231
<i>your last chance.</i>

35:51.524 --> 35:54.652
<i>Do you really want to stay here
for the rest of your life?</i>

36:20.094 --> 36:22.180
<i>I have nothing else to say.</i>

36:22.221 --> 36:25.183
<i>What? Why?</i>

36:25.224 --> 36:27.393
<i>I'm sorry, but I don't want you
to represent me anymore.</i>

36:31.564 --> 36:33.357
<i>Guard.</i>

36:49.081 --> 36:51.709
<i>-Hello?
- Grace, it's Rachel.</i>

36:51.751 --> 36:53.878
<i>Hey. What's going on?
Is everything okay?</i>

36:53.920 --> 36:56.214
<i>Billy fired me.</i>

36:56.255 --> 36:57.798
<i>What?</i>

36:57.840 --> 37:00.176
<i>-Why?
- I have no idea.</i>

37:00.218 --> 37:03.095
<i>I'm afraid you're gonna have
to find your son another lawyer.</i>

37:03.137 --> 37:04.889
<i>-Good luck.
- What? Hey--</i>

37:04.931 --> 37:07.433
All right,
that's all she wrote, ladies.

37:11.812 --> 37:13.397
<i>What?</i>

37:13.439 --> 37:14.982
<i>What happened?</i>

37:15.024 --> 37:16.692
<i>We got less than 30%.</i>

37:20.738 --> 37:22.573
<i>That's impossible.</i>

37:24.033 --> 37:26.827
<i>Thank you for your
trust in me, ladies.</i>

37:26.869 --> 37:28.996
<i>Uh, I'm sorry you all had
to go through this.</i>

37:29.038 --> 37:30.915
<i>I know it's been
a-a trying time.</i>

37:30.957 --> 37:34.585
<i>I'm just happy that, uh...</i>

37:34.627 --> 37:37.672
<i>we can get things
back to normal now.</i>

37:40.466 --> 37:42.593
<i>Uh, why don't we take</i>

37:42.635 --> 37:44.053
<i>a 20-minute break</i>

37:44.095 --> 37:45.429
<i>before we get back to work?</i>

37:45.471 --> 37:46.806
<i>All right? 20 minutes.</i>

37:52.812 --> 37:56.482
<i>Grace...
Well, clearly they got scared.</i>

37:58.985 --> 38:01.362
<i>I'm done playing
by the fucking rules.</i>

38:02.405 --> 38:04.365
<i>dramatic music</i>

38:06.534 --> 38:09.036
<i></i>

38:45.364 --> 38:46.991
<i>Going cold turkey.</i>

38:47.033 --> 38:48.617
<i>That's a lot of pills.</i>

38:48.659 --> 38:49.994
<i>You sure you're up for this?</i>

38:50.036 --> 38:51.454
<i>It could make things
a little erratic.</i>

38:51.495 --> 38:53.205
<i>It's time.</i>

38:54.999 --> 38:56.834
<i>Suit yourself.</i>

38:57.460 --> 39:00.421
<i>County sheriff's office
picked up the guy who sold</i>

39:00.463 --> 39:03.424
<i>that lethal dose of tainted
cocaine to Trent Tisdell.</i>

39:03.466 --> 39:05.343
<i>So that's good news.</i>

39:05.384 --> 39:07.595
<i>That is good news.</i>

39:07.636 --> 39:09.055
<i>Had him in for questioning.</i>

39:09.096 --> 39:11.223
<i>Hoping to work it back</i>

39:11.265 --> 39:13.601
<i>to whoever's selling
around the county.</i>

39:14.602 --> 39:17.188
<i>Well, I mean, sounds
like the sheriff is doing</i>

39:17.229 --> 39:19.148
<i>-good police work.
- Yeah, sometimes</i>

39:19.190 --> 39:21.442
<i>our community leaders
actually come through for us.</i>

39:21.484 --> 39:24.528
<i>Restores your faith in people.</i>

39:26.155 --> 39:28.407
<i>-Take care, Jackson.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

39:38.793 --> 39:41.712
<i>slow, mysterious music</i>

40:38.686 --> 40:40.771
<i>Isaac.</i>

40:51.991 --> 40:53.951
<i>Whoa, hey, hey!</i>

40:56.871 --> 40:59.457
<i>Isaac.</i>

41:01.584 --> 41:02.710
<i>Isaac.</i>

41:04.170 --> 41:06.088
<i>-It's okay.</i>

41:06.130 --> 41:09.133
<i>It's okay. It's okay. I got you.</i>

41:11.677 --> 41:14.054
<i>Just breathe, Isaac.</i>

41:16.682 --> 41:18.726
<i>-Breathe.</i>

41:22.021 --> 41:23.939
<i>It wasn't murder.</i>

41:23.981 --> 41:26.317
<i>It was self-defense.</i>

41:26.358 --> 41:28.986
<i>Sort of.</i>

41:29.028 --> 41:31.530
<i>We were heading out of town.</i>

41:31.572 --> 41:33.782
<i>We were walking.
He was seeing me off.</i>

41:33.824 --> 41:38.037
<i>And then Billy saw this guy dip
into an abandoned steel mill.</i>

41:39.246 --> 41:41.457
<i>It was this ex-cop who
had messed with him in the past,</i>

41:41.499 --> 41:44.668
<i>so... Billy went in after him.</i>

41:44.710 --> 41:48.339
<i>After a minute, Billy didn't
come out, so I followed him in.</i>

41:48.380 --> 41:51.300
<i>And I saw that this...</i>

41:51.342 --> 41:53.844
<i>other guy had
a knife to his neck,</i>

41:53.886 --> 41:56.138
<i>like... a hunting knife.</i>

41:57.223 --> 41:59.391
<i>And the ex-cop was
on the ground, about ten feet</i>

41:59.433 --> 42:01.101
<i>away from them, I think.</i>

42:01.143 --> 42:03.687
<i>Billy must've knocked him down.</i>

42:03.729 --> 42:05.689
<i>And then the ex-cop got up
and it looked like</i>

42:05.731 --> 42:07.316
<i>he was getting a knife when...</i>

42:07.358 --> 42:10.444
<i>I came up behind him
with a wrench</i>

42:10.486 --> 42:12.863
<i>I found on the floor
of the steel mill.</i>

42:15.366 --> 42:17.326
<i>slow, intense music</i>

42:19.578 --> 42:21.497
<i>I hit the ex-cop
in the back of the head</i>

42:21.539 --> 42:23.541
<i>as hard as I could.</i>

42:30.047 --> 42:31.966
<i>It seemed like
he was gonna hurt Billy.</i>

42:32.007 --> 42:34.385
<i>I-I was sure of it, I...</i>

42:35.719 --> 42:38.180
<i>It was a lot of blood.</i>

42:39.807 --> 42:41.308
<i>And where's Billy now?</i>

42:42.268 --> 42:44.311
<i>Just found out he's in prison.</i>

42:45.563 --> 42:47.565
<i>Awaiting trial.</i>

42:47.606 --> 42:50.025
<i>He was charged with murder one,</i>

42:50.067 --> 42:51.944
<i>for the man I killed.</i>

42:55.781 --> 42:59.034
<i>I think he's giving up his life
for me.</i>

43:10.713 --> 43:13.299
<i>You know, when you say his name,
your face changes.</i>

43:15.884 --> 43:17.803
<i>You care about him a lot.</i>

43:20.806 --> 43:23.267
<i>-Were you two...?
- No.</i>

43:23.309 --> 43:25.936
<i>It wasn't like that.</i>

43:35.571 --> 43:38.365
<i>Seems like you have
a big decision to make.</i>

43:45.039 --> 43:48.125
<i>Well, I was young
and hungry</i>

43:48.167 --> 43:50.961
<i>And about to leave
that place</i>

43:51.003 --> 43:53.922
<i>When just as I was leaving</i>

43:53.964 --> 43:56.925
<i>Well, she looked me
in the face</i>

43:56.967 --> 43:59.803
<i>I said,
"You must know the answer"</i>

43:59.845 --> 44:02.556
<i>She said,
"No, but I'll give it a try"</i>

44:02.598 --> 44:05.809
<i>And to this very day,
we've been living our way</i>

44:05.851 --> 44:08.562
<i>Here is the reason why</i>

44:08.604 --> 44:11.398
<i>Blow up your TV</i>

44:11.440 --> 44:13.901
<i>Throw away your paper</i>

44:13.942 --> 44:16.779
<i>Go to the country</i>

44:16.820 --> 44:20.240
<i>Build you a home</i>

44:20.282 --> 44:23.243
<i>Plant a little garden</i>

44:23.285 --> 44:26.163
<i>Eat a lot of peaches</i>

44:26.205 --> 44:28.999
<i>Try and find Jesus</i>

44:29.041 --> 44:32.503
<i>On your own.</i>

45:01.782 --> 45:03.701
<i>tense, percussive music</i>

46:11.101 --> 46:13.771
<i>distortion-heavy rock music</i>

46:44.343 --> 46:46.470
<i>-Thanks, Belle.
- Thanks.</i>

46:47.679 --> 46:49.306
<i>Uh...</i>

46:49.348 --> 46:52.559
<i>don't go too close
to that corner.</i>

46:52.601 --> 46:55.312
<i>It's the bad luck corner.</i>

46:55.354 --> 46:59.149
<i>You're fine here and-and there.</i>

47:07.699 --> 47:10.410
<i>Well, enjoy your tea, boys.</i>

47:10.452 --> 47:11.662
<i>Chamomile.</i>

47:11.703 --> 47:13.497
<i>Supposed to be calming.</i>

47:21.421 --> 47:23.632
<i>So what are you doing here,
Jackson?</i>

47:23.674 --> 47:25.843
<i>It appears the county sheriff</i>

47:25.884 --> 47:27.719
<i>is getting wise to things.</i>

47:27.761 --> 47:30.138
<i>They've been questioning
the Emaciated One.</i>

47:30.180 --> 47:32.057
<i>And it's only a matter of time
until he slips up</i>

47:32.099 --> 47:33.600
<i>and gives them
your friend Michael.</i>

47:33.642 --> 47:35.352
<i>-Great.
- And I'll bet my flat,</i>

47:35.394 --> 47:37.521
<i>white ass that nimrod will take</i>

47:37.563 --> 47:40.023
<i>a fucking deal from the D.A.
and rat us out.</i>

47:40.065 --> 47:42.526
<i>Look, the bottom line here?</i>

47:42.568 --> 47:45.279
<i>We can't have anything leading
the police back to Michael,</i>

47:45.320 --> 47:47.990
<i>because it'll lead them
directly to this porch,</i>

47:48.031 --> 47:50.284
<i>and then to my fucking pharmacy.</i>

47:50.325 --> 47:53.620
<i>And we are now in the center
of a complete fucking shit show.</i>

47:53.662 --> 47:55.706
<i>Hey, just chill out, okay?</i>

47:55.747 --> 47:57.040
<i>I'll take care of it.</i>

47:57.082 --> 47:59.126
<i>You'll take care of it how?</i>

48:00.669 --> 48:02.462
<i>Just drink your tea.</i>

48:02.504 --> 48:03.964
<i>Like the old lady said...</i>

48:04.006 --> 48:05.716
<i>it's calming.</i>

48:11.388 --> 48:13.348
<i>soft, dramatic music</i>

48:19.521 --> 48:21.565
<i>Isaac?</i>

48:28.947 --> 48:30.866
<i>Isaac?</i>

49:14.159 --> 49:16.244
<i>Thank you.</i>

49:24.044 --> 49:25.671
<i>I just got off the phone</i>

49:25.712 --> 49:27.673
<i>with Eddie Roe
at the fire department.</i>

49:27.714 --> 49:29.800
<i>They're looking
at possible arson.</i>

49:31.635 --> 49:34.846
<i>Surrounding property is fine.</i>

49:37.057 --> 49:39.977
<i>I can't believe
somebody actually did that.</i>

49:42.187 --> 49:44.439
<i>It's a beautiful piece
of land, Grace.</i>

49:44.481 --> 49:47.109
<i>You'll always have that.</i>

49:50.779 --> 49:52.489
<i>Is there anything we can do?</i>

49:52.531 --> 49:54.157
<i>About the fire?</i>

49:54.199 --> 49:56.576
<i>About Billy.</i>

49:57.828 --> 50:00.080
<i>My son is gonna spend
the rest of his life</i>

50:00.122 --> 50:02.249
<i>in that prison,
and he's not gonna make it.</i>

50:04.376 --> 50:06.503
<i>I mean, you should've seen him.
He-he looked like a...</i>

50:06.545 --> 50:08.338
<i>abused animal.</i>

50:08.380 --> 50:10.507
<i>-Grace.</i>

50:10.549 --> 50:12.676
<i>You have been through a lot.
You're exhausted.</i>

50:12.718 --> 50:15.512
<i>What you need is
a good night's sleep.</i>

50:16.722 --> 50:19.307
<i>Yeah. Sorry. My mind's...</i>

50:19.349 --> 50:21.935
<i>it's all over the place.</i>

50:25.731 --> 50:28.316
<i>Thank you for taking me in.</i>

50:28.358 --> 50:31.737
<i>You can stay here as long
as you need to, okay?</i>

50:31.778 --> 50:34.031
<i>What's mine is yours.</i>

50:34.072 --> 50:37.909
<i>Bud and me are gonna be
the best roommates you ever had.</i>

50:37.951 --> 50:41.038
<i>You should see what Bud can do
with a load of laundry.</i>

50:41.079 --> 50:43.999
<i>World-class folding skills.</i>

50:51.965 --> 50:55.719
<i>I am gonna take
such good care of you.</i>

50:55.761 --> 50:58.805
<i>I'm gonna take
good care of you, too, Grace.</i>

51:00.599 --> 51:03.226
<i>Because this is
what this is now, right?</i>

51:03.268 --> 51:05.979
<i>This is what this is now.</i>

51:07.355 --> 51:09.399
<i>Yes.</i>

51:15.530 --> 51:17.741
<i>I am all yours, Del.</i>

51:19.367 --> 51:21.787
<i>You have me completely.</i>

51:25.082 --> 51:28.085
<i>And we are gonna go above
and beyond for each other.</i>

51:28.126 --> 51:31.046
Because I would do
anything for you.

51:34.299 --> 51:36.134
<i>Would you do anything for me?</i>

51:36.176 --> 51:37.385
<i>Yes.</i>

51:37.427 --> 51:39.471
<i>Yeah.</i>

51:39.513 --> 51:41.473
<i>low, tense music</i>

51:46.311 --> 51:48.396
<i>I know where he is.</i>

51:50.482 --> 51:52.526
<i>Who?</i>

51:53.777 --> 51:55.821
<i>That Bobby guy.</i>

51:57.155 --> 51:59.199
<i>I found him.</i>

52:08.291 --> 52:10.919
<i>-You found him?
- Yeah.</i>

52:20.345 --> 52:22.389
<i>Then you know
what has to be done.</i>

52:30.272 --> 52:32.691
<i>I want to hear you say it.</i>

52:32.732 --> 52:34.818
<i>Say it, Del.</i>

52:39.239 --> 52:41.867
<i>I know.</i>

52:41.908 --> 52:43.994
<i>You know what?</i>

52:47.247 --> 52:49.624
<i>I know what has to be done.</i>

52:59.384 --> 53:01.386
<i>dramatic, pulsing music</i>

53:20.572 --> 53:22.532
<i>quiet, tense music</i>
