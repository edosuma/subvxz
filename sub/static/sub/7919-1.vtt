01:37.256 --> 01:38.598
Then... You've made up your mind?

01:38.790 --> 01:40.679
You are going through with it?

01:41.629 --> 01:42.780
Why not?

01:42.278 --> 01:44.548
For one thing, he's an excellent chap.

01:44.936 --> 01:47.140
At least try to get some sleep.

01:47.367 --> 01:49.756
And if I were you, no more cognac.

01:49.959 --> 01:51.869
We'll come for you at five.
It'd give you three hours.

01:52.709 --> 01:53.500
You will be here.

01:53.703 --> 01:55.971
I don't mind so much being killed.

01:56.327 --> 02:00.800
But you know how hard it is for
me to get up in the morning.

02:01.159 --> 02:01.509
Good night.

02:01.735 --> 02:04.550
Good night.

02:08.328 --> 02:12.550
I'm afraid this time, Stefan has picked
a fight with the wrong man

02:12.742 --> 02:17.663
I wonder if he'll be here
when we come back?

02:17.862 --> 02:18.626
Who is it?

02:18.822 --> 02:19.553
Brand.

02:19.782 --> 02:24.517
Good morning, Mr. Brand.

02:37.958 --> 02:39.584
Cheer up, John.

02:39.782 --> 02:42.848
This is one engagement
that I have no intention of keeping.

02:43.469 --> 02:46.395
Honor is a luxury,
only gentlemen can afford.

02:46.631 --> 02:48.929
Pack my things...

02:48.295 --> 02:53.794
Whatever you think
that I'll need for an indefinite stay.

02:53.991 --> 02:55.878
I have a cab downstairs...

02:56.102 --> 03:00.543
In about an hour,
I'll go out the back way.

03:00.742 --> 03:06.438
I'm sorry.
I won't be here to see their faces.

03:10.854 --> 03:14.519
Did this come during the night?

03:14.247 --> 03:19.943
Would you bring me
some coffee... with cognac?

04:21.798 --> 04:26.533
"By the time you read this letter,
I may be dead."

04:26.886 --> 04:31.163
"I have so much to tell you,
perhaps very little time."

04:31.367 --> 04:32.893
"Will I ever send it?"

04:33.126 --> 04:36.901
"I don't know."

04:38.374 --> 04:42.783
"I must find the strength to write, now
before it's too late."

04:43.143 --> 04:47.485
"And as I write, it may become clear
that what happened to us"

04:47.687 --> 04:51.997
"...had its own reason beyond
our poor understanding."

04:52.232 --> 04:53.692
"If this reaches you..."

04:53.927 --> 04:55.682
"You'll know how I became yours..."

04:55.879 --> 05:00.516
"When you didn't know who I was,
or even that I existed."

05:00.711 --> 05:05.446
"I think everyone has two birthdays.
The day of his physical birth..."

05:05.672 --> 05:08.966
"... and the beginning
of his conscious life."

05:09.160 --> 05:11.396
"Nothing is vivid...
or really my memory."

05:11.591 --> 05:13.348
"Before that day in spring..."

05:13.574 --> 05:14.468
"When I came home from school,"

05:14.855 --> 05:20.550
"And found a moving
van in front of our building."

05:38.343 --> 05:39.935
"I wondered about our new neighbour..."

05:40.136 --> 05:42.307
"Who owned such beautiful things."

05:42.663 --> 05:45.850
Lisa! Come in, Lisa!

05:45.287 --> 05:48.963
Come in this minute, did you hear?

05:49.319 --> 05:50.562
Lisa!

05:50.790 --> 05:53.605
Yes, mother.

05:55.654 --> 05:57.279
Who is going to clean that up?

05:57.478 --> 05:58.590
Me. I suppose.

05:58.951 --> 06:02.725
I haven't enough to do.

06:03.814 --> 06:04.708
You better get another rope.

06:04.934 --> 06:05.350
Uh?

06:05.703 --> 06:06.848
You better get another rope.

06:07.470 --> 06:09.151
Alright!

06:09.511 --> 06:11.499
Get another rope!

06:11.367 --> 06:13.254
This is the last time I move a musician.

06:13.478 --> 06:19.175
Why does he have to play the piano?

06:23.591 --> 06:26.439
Where do these go?

06:26.824 --> 06:29.637
What?

06:33.158 --> 06:35.973
In the study.

06:41.223 --> 06:42.206
Thank you.

06:42.439 --> 06:44.446
Lisa, what are you doing out there?

06:44.678 --> 06:47.494
Come inside.

07:00.934 --> 07:05.156
"I didn't see you that day,
or from many days there after."

07:05.382 --> 07:11.779
"But I could listen to your playing."

07:36.558 --> 07:38.598
I wish he'd stop that noise.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.813
It's not noise.

07:41.007 --> 07:45.033
Don't bite my head off.
Mr. Brand is playing.

07:45.509 --> 07:45.765
You called that playing?

07:45.966 --> 07:48.781
Shh...

07:57.390 --> 07:58.918
How old is he?

07:59.118 --> 08:02.099
Who?

08:01.486 --> 08:04.334
Him!

08:04.814 --> 08:06.341
Quite old, I guess.

08:06.702 --> 08:08.612
Oh.

08:08.846 --> 08:11.082
You know the boy
I was talking to outside the school?

08:11.438 --> 08:14.754
The bony one with the yellow
hair and the long nose.

08:14.990 --> 08:17.163
One who lives next to the grocery.

08:17.358 --> 08:18.668
I'm gonna do something about it...

08:18.862 --> 08:22.637
If he doesn’t keep his hands to himself.

08:22.990 --> 08:28.108
These things he does,
right out in the street.

09:05.519 --> 09:10.637
Thank you, John.
I'll be home later.

09:19.663 --> 09:22.478
Thank you.

09:23.023 --> 09:25.838
Good morning.

09:36.110 --> 09:41.708
Why, Lisa! You're all red in the face.

09:41.903 --> 09:44.042
You're blushing!

09:44.590 --> 09:46.573
I'll get you for that!

09:46.767 --> 09:48.709
"Yes, I was blushing."

09:48.911 --> 09:51.497
"And hard as it
may be for you to realize..."

09:51.695 --> 09:56.038
"From that moment on,
I was in love with you."

09:56.590 --> 09:59.533
"Quite consciously,
I was preparing myself for you."

09:59.887 --> 10:04.328
"I kept my clothes neater,
so you wouldn't be ashamed of me."

10:04.687 --> 10:07.000
Bow, two three four...

10:06.639 --> 10:08.199
"I went to dancing school."

10:08.559 --> 10:13.927
"I wanted to become more graceful,
and learn good manners for you."

10:15.070 --> 10:18.411
Bow... two three, and one two three...

10:18.607 --> 10:22.382
And one two three...

10:24.911 --> 10:27.431
"So I would know more about you,
and your world..."

10:27.791 --> 10:28.968
"I went to the library..."

10:29.199 --> 10:34.895
"And study the lifes
of great musicians of the past."

10:46.063 --> 10:48.397
"Though I was not able to
go to your concerts,"

10:48.751 --> 10:54.447
"I found ways of sharing in
your success."

11:04.110 --> 11:08.040
"As months went by,
I began to know your friends."

11:08.590 --> 11:13.935
"Many of them are women. Most of them."

11:14.447 --> 11:17.820
Lisa!

11:20.751 --> 11:21.645
Lisa!

11:21.839 --> 11:25.614
Where are you, Lisa?

11:28.302 --> 11:33.999
Aren't you going to finish your dinner?

11:34.543 --> 11:37.460
Sorry, mother.

11:42.511 --> 11:46.701
"But I really lived for
those evenings when you're alone."

11:46.895 --> 11:52.591
"And I pretended
that you're playing just for me."

12:06.430 --> 12:08.076
"I know you didn't know it..."

12:08.431 --> 12:14.127
"You're giving me some
of the happiest hours of my life."

13:31.182 --> 13:33.671
"Then came a great day for me."

13:33.871 --> 13:35.562
"In the building where we lived..."

13:35.791 --> 13:41.487
"... Thursday was rug-beating day."

13:47.151 --> 13:47.817
Come on, let's help him!

13:48.174 --> 13:49.516
Oh! I've got to do my own.

13:49.711 --> 13:56.934
I'll do it for you afterwards.
Come on!

13:59.055 --> 13:59.982
Remember what you've promised!

14:00.175 --> 14:02.989
I will.

14:07.374 --> 14:10.156
Beautiful rug.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.333
It's a beautiful rug, isn't it?

14:11.535 --> 14:12.614
Oh, it's just a rug.

14:12.815 --> 14:16.590
Oh, you wouldn't know.

14:17.103 --> 14:18.794
Say, what are we doing this for?

14:18.991 --> 14:20.300
Shh! He will hear you.

14:20.399 --> 14:22.733
Oh, he can't talk.

14:22.927 --> 14:28.524
Well, he can hear, can't he?

14:34.191 --> 14:36.362
You're welcome.

14:36.559 --> 14:37.639
Come on, Lisa.

14:37.998 --> 14:38.860
I'll be right down.

14:39.054 --> 14:40.036
What are you going to do?

14:40.590 --> 14:41.449
Go away, I'll be right down.

14:41.807 --> 14:42.700
What are you going to do?

14:42.927 --> 14:46.309
Go away, or I'll throw you downstairs.

14:46.671 --> 14:49.485
Are you crazy?

16:51.663 --> 16:54.477
Lisa!

16:57.518 --> 17:00.104
What are you doing up there?

17:00.302 --> 17:03.302
Come dear, I've something to tell you.

17:03.695 --> 17:06.826
It's really good news.

17:07.021 --> 17:13.930
If you think about it sensibly,
you'll be very very happy.

17:15.059 --> 17:17.134
Sit down.

17:28.398 --> 17:29.924
I can understand
that you must've been startled...

17:30.158 --> 17:32.679
When you saw
Herr Kastner and me in the hall.

17:32.878 --> 17:37.515
Perhaps it's my fault for not telling
you something about it before...

17:37.711 --> 17:41.539
You see, dear,
your mother is not really old.

17:41.742 --> 17:42.757
She can have admirers, too.

17:43.119 --> 17:47.975
She can even... well, be in love with a man.

17:48.173 --> 17:53.180
Someday you'll understand
better what that means.

17:52.654 --> 17:53.124
Besides...

17:53.326 --> 17:56.621
You know how hard it is for us to
get along on my small pension.

17:56.814 --> 17:58.756
Herr Kastner has a comfortable business in Linz.

17:58.958 --> 18:01.926
A military tailor.

18:03.059 --> 18:07.981
And he's done me the honor
of asking to marry him.

18:09.391 --> 18:13.130
Besides, he is a kind man,
and he likes you very much.

18:12.494 --> 18:14.981
I'm sure with his help,
it'll be much easier for you to...

18:15.182 --> 18:17.604
Mother!

18:17.806 --> 18:18.602
What is it?

18:18.831 --> 18:20.040
Would we have to go to Linz?

18:20.399 --> 18:22.057
Would we have to live there?

18:22.414 --> 18:23.461
But why not?

18:23.662 --> 18:24.873
What is there to keep us here?

18:25.500 --> 18:26.309
I won't go!

18:26.542 --> 18:27.076
I won't go!

18:27.311 --> 18:28.586
Lisa!

18:28.783 --> 18:30.319
What's the matter?

18:30.413 --> 18:32.007
But... what is it?

18:32.799 --> 18:33.035
Lisa!

18:33.509 --> 18:34.092
I won't go.

18:35.069 --> 18:35.497
I won't go.

18:35.855 --> 18:38.788
Now Lisa!
Do be reasonable and tell your mother.

18:38.990 --> 18:39.818
I won't! I won't!

18:40.047 --> 18:42.861
Lisa!

18:47.918 --> 18:49.479
Let see...
We've eleven altogether.

18:49.678 --> 18:54.697
One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six.
Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Eleven.

18:55.055 --> 18:55.948
It comes, Dear.

18:56.142 --> 18:57.419
Don't worry, dear.
I'll take care of everything.

18:57.614 --> 19:00.712
The adjustment promised the trunk
said that...

19:00.942 --> 19:04.488
Oh, either I'd lost half a minute...
or the station parts ahead.

19:04.686 --> 19:06.028
How much would that be, please?

19:06.740 --> 19:06.756
It's up to you, sir.

19:06.958 --> 19:08.584
Up to me?

19:08.814 --> 19:10.722
One dollar should be enough.

19:10.927 --> 19:12.715
The guy promised the trunk
would be here on time.

19:12.910 --> 19:13.859
With all the boxes...

19:14.420 --> 19:17.157
One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six.

19:17.357 --> 19:21.831
Uh... how long will it take
if we send them through Linz third class?

19:22.030 --> 19:22.532
Two weeks, maybe.

19:22.894 --> 19:24.301
Two weeks... very good.

19:24.494 --> 19:26.915
Now each of these... second class.

19:27.151 --> 19:28.164
Third class...

19:28.526 --> 19:30.019
Each of these... third class.

19:30.430 --> 19:30.921
Yes...

19:31.117 --> 19:33.671
Ah... what did I tell you.

19:33.871 --> 19:35.463
When you're going to a thing,
do it one time.

19:35.693 --> 19:36.903
That is always nice.

19:37.819 --> 19:37.861
Hello. Thank you.

19:38.420 --> 19:39.170
You can unload it here.

19:39.375 --> 19:40.683
Our train doesn't leave until 12:00.

19:41.038 --> 19:41.932
Yes, 12:00, darling.

19:42.125 --> 19:44.973
The twelve!

19:48.942 --> 19:49.989
Please don't get excited, dear.

19:50.191 --> 19:53.006
I'd be calm.

19:56.654 --> 20:00.517
"Suddenly I knew
I couldn't live without you."

20:00.750 --> 20:02.538
"I didn't know what I had in mind, or..."

20:02.734 --> 20:05.635
"...what my parents would do
when they found me missing."

20:05.999 --> 20:09.096
"All I wanted was to see you once more."

20:10.140 --> 20:10.025
"To be near you again."

20:10.420 --> 20:14.360
"To throw myself at your feet,
cling to you, and never leave you."

20:14.574 --> 20:20.900
"Nothing else. Nothing else mattered."

20:23.501 --> 20:26.567
Alright, alright.

20:26.767 --> 20:28.653
Oh, it's you, Lisa.

20:29.006 --> 20:32.355
I thought by now
that you're half way to Linz?

20:32.557 --> 20:35.019
Didn't your train leave in about...

20:34.478 --> 20:38.730
I forgot something.

21:58.798 --> 22:03.402
"These rooms where I'd lived,
have been filled with your music."

22:03.597 --> 22:05.987
"Now they were empty."

22:06.190 --> 22:08.500
"Would they ever come to life again?"

22:08.431 --> 22:09.990
"Would I?"

22:10.190 --> 22:12.100
"Only you could answer."

22:12.302 --> 22:14.636
"So, I waited."

22:14.862 --> 22:17.677
"Waited..."

22:18.062 --> 22:21.789
"For what seemed endless hours
I sat outside your door..."

22:21.453 --> 22:23.429
"Try to keep myself awake."

22:23.630 --> 22:26.690
"...afraid that
I might fall asleep and miss you."

22:26.446 --> 22:30.140
"Then..."

22:33.069 --> 22:34.052
Who is it?

22:34.740 --> 22:34.788
Brand!

22:34.990 --> 22:39.725
Good morning, Mr. Brand.

23:19.823 --> 23:22.538
"And so, there was nothing left for me."

23:22.734 --> 23:26.509
"I went to Linz."

23:32.142 --> 23:34.630
"You who have always lived so freely..."

23:34.990 --> 23:39.976
"Have you any idea
what life's like in a little garrison town?"

23:40.173 --> 23:41.799
"I was eighteen now..."

23:41.998 --> 23:46.634
"And was expected to take
my place in society."

23:46.830 --> 23:49.383
Come now, Lisa.
Don't look down at your feet.

23:49.583 --> 23:51.590
Please be tactful and
let him do the talking.

23:51.789 --> 23:55.700
But not all the talking.
Do you hear me, Lisa?

23:55.405 --> 23:56.420
Good morning, Colonel.

23:56.622 --> 23:59.437
Good morning, Colonel.

23:59.630 --> 24:02.444
Good morning.

24:03.950 --> 24:06.950
Mrs. Kastner, Miss Kastner.
Mr. Kastner.

24:07.150 --> 24:09.150
May I have the honor to
present you my nephew...

24:08.653 --> 24:11.500
Lt. Leopold von Kaltnegger.

24:11.693 --> 24:13.635
I have the honor to kiss your hand.

24:13.838 --> 24:15.016
Very pleased to make your acquaintance.

24:15.374 --> 24:15.972
Thank you, Lieutenant.

24:16.334 --> 24:18.668
Mr. Kastner, I have the honor, Sir.

24:18.862 --> 24:20.007
I'm very pleased to make
your acquaintance.

24:20.700 --> 24:21.634
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Thank you.

24:21.998 --> 24:23.972
Allow me to present our daughter, Lisa.

24:24.173 --> 24:27.949
Lt. Leopold von Kaltnegger.

24:34.638 --> 24:38.413
Good morning...

24:40.782 --> 24:43.596
Excuse me.

24:46.701 --> 24:48.524
Do you like it here in Linz?

24:48.878 --> 24:52.190
Quiet well.

24:51.501 --> 24:54.348
It must seemed
very restfull after living in Vienna?

24:54.701 --> 24:56.196
I liked Vienna.

24:56.557 --> 24:58.500
Indeed.

24:58.734 --> 25:02.923
What did you like about it?

25:03.980 --> 25:04.456
Perhaps you were fond of the music?

25:04.653 --> 25:06.542
Yes.

25:06.734 --> 25:09.003
We also have good music here.

25:09.198 --> 25:12.744
Every other Saturday afternoon
they gave a concert on the Kursalon.

25:12.942 --> 25:15.039
Oh, really?

25:14.478 --> 25:17.194
Perhaps someday you'll allow
me the honor to escorting you?

25:17.390 --> 25:19.081
Very nice of you.

25:19.980 --> 25:21.699
When I was a cadet,
I took part of myself.

25:21.902 --> 25:22.632
I played second trumpet.

25:22.830 --> 25:23.975
Oh, how nice.

25:24.334 --> 25:26.755
I must say I'm glad we both like music.

25:27.630 --> 25:33.326
You see there's nothing wrong
with a child if she only meets the right people

25:40.799 --> 25:43.521
Up! Up! Up! Up!

25:43.726 --> 25:46.573
Up! Up! Up!

25:49.645 --> 25:50.790
"The Lieutenant was right."

25:50.990 --> 25:52.878
"Linz was a musical town."

25:53.500 --> 25:55.302
"So twice a month
that summer we listened..."

25:55.501 --> 26:00.138
"The Lieutenant and I."

26:27.597 --> 26:30.663
Before the afternoon is over,
I'm sure we'll hear an announcement

26:30.862 --> 26:32.750
Nothing could please us more, Colonel.

26:32.941 --> 26:37.676
Is that right, my dear?

26:39.980 --> 26:44.328
Miss Lisa, this is a subject
which I wish to bring up for some time

26:44.526 --> 26:48.500
I trust you'd forgive me to
presume the action that I allow myself...

26:48.398 --> 26:51.059
It maybe unnecessary to mention that...

26:50.670 --> 26:51.847
Ever since you first came
to my attention,

26:52.046 --> 26:53.671
I've been most favourably impressed.

26:53.870 --> 26:54.501
Thank you.

26:54.734 --> 26:56.676
And I believe
that your parents are not opposed...

26:56.878 --> 26:59.813
...my keeping company
that is dedicated with you.

27:00.173 --> 27:00.674
But, Lieutenant, I...

27:00.878 --> 27:03.661
Oh, please allow me to finish.

27:04.013 --> 27:06.500
As far as my prospects are concerned,
you must be aware that...

27:06.701 --> 27:08.556
It's generally believed
by my uncle and others,

27:08.942 --> 27:11.396
That I have qualifications
for an outstanding military career.

27:11.758 --> 27:12.619
It's no doubt of that.

27:12.814 --> 27:15.049
Naturally, it's too soon to
discuss any definite steps.

27:15.660 --> 27:16.674
We should know each other
for a reasonable time...

27:16.878 --> 27:17.161
But, Lieutenant...

27:17.518 --> 27:18.924
I'm sorry, it's impossible.

27:19.117 --> 27:21.322
It's impossible?

27:21.518 --> 27:22.565
Please allow me to explain.

27:22.798 --> 27:26.059
I must insist.
Is there someone else?

27:26.740 --> 27:27.365
Yes.

27:27.566 --> 27:28.644
I'm engaged to be married.

27:29.006 --> 27:30.315
Engaged to be married?

27:30.509 --> 27:32.529
I should've told you before,
but I didn't realize how...

27:32.430 --> 27:33.378
But all the time you've been in Linz,

27:33.582 --> 27:34.727
I haven't seen anyone's company.

27:34.926 --> 27:36.301
He doesn't live in Linz.
He lives in Vienna.

27:36.653 --> 27:37.581
In Vienna?

27:37.774 --> 27:39.977
He... he writes music, he's a musician.

27:40.173 --> 27:41.189
But how can that be?

27:41.549 --> 27:43.491
Your mother and father,
they gave my uncle the encouragement...

27:43.693 --> 27:45.003
They don't know yet!

27:45.357 --> 27:49.100
You're engaged to a man,
and your parents don't even know him?

27:50.140 --> 27:50.341
Um...

27:50.542 --> 27:53.837
I'm sorry, I...

27:54.029 --> 27:56.779
Then, please.

27:59.182 --> 28:04.878
Waiter, the wine. The wine.

28:13.669 --> 28:16.518
Up! Up!

28:40.197 --> 28:40.764
But I don't understand.

28:40.998 --> 28:44.031
Lisa, sit down. What happened?

28:44.389 --> 28:44.639
Nothing.

28:45.500 --> 28:45.404
But after all...

28:45.606 --> 28:46.751
But you must've said something.

28:46.950 --> 28:47.648
What did you say to him?

28:48.260 --> 28:49.471
I only told him the truth.

28:49.702 --> 28:51.709
The truth! What do you mean the truth?

28:52.070 --> 28:53.347
What did you say to him?

28:53.542 --> 28:56.640
I told him, I wasn't free.

28:56.998 --> 28:57.793
What...?

28:57.990 --> 29:01.056
"My poor parents,
for them this was the end."

29:01.253 --> 29:06.950
"For me, it was a new beginning."

29:07.462 --> 29:09.697
"Vienna, when I saw it again,"

29:10.740 --> 29:12.446
"seemed to have taken
on a new splendour."

29:12.677 --> 29:14.565
"All the time I've been away,"

29:14.790 --> 29:17.310
"I thought longingly, it's your city."

29:17.510 --> 29:20.476
"Now, it was our city."

29:20.677 --> 29:22.915
"Madam Spitzer's where I found work."

29:23.109 --> 29:26.405
"It's the kind of establishment
where one learns many things."

29:26.758 --> 29:28.099
Miss Lisa, please.

29:28.293 --> 29:31.140
Coming.

29:39.340 --> 29:41.668
Hold your breath.

29:42.022 --> 29:47.716
Miss Lisa, we're waiting.

29:56.709 --> 29:57.603
Very pretty.

29:57.798 --> 30:00.500
Yes.

30:00.230 --> 30:03.077
Very.

30:25.318 --> 30:29.091
Very charming. Very charming, indeed.

30:29.318 --> 30:29.983
Do you think...

30:30.182 --> 30:32.931
She is not like the others,
I don't understand that girl...

30:33.126 --> 30:34.052
But every evening,

30:34.244 --> 30:37.955
As soon as these shutters are closed,
off she goes straight home.

30:38.148 --> 30:40.964
Really?

30:44.134 --> 30:46.467
"Madam Spitzer spoke the truth."

30:46.694 --> 30:48.799
"I was not like the others."

30:49.157 --> 30:52.605
"Nobody waited for me."

30:52.965 --> 30:55.551
"Off I went, not home..."

30:55.909 --> 31:00.165
"But to the only place
that it ever seemed home to me."

31:00.358 --> 31:05.109
"Night after night,
I returned to the same spot."

31:05.029 --> 31:10.725
"But you never noticed me...
until one evening."

32:20.326 --> 32:24.994
I've seen you before, few nights ago.

32:25.190 --> 32:28.505
Right here. Or... you live near here?

32:29.500 --> 32:31.716
No.

32:31.909 --> 32:34.277
You like to listen to the street singers?

32:34.629 --> 32:35.774
Um... yes.

32:35.973 --> 32:38.788
Neither do I.

32:42.022 --> 32:42.980
I should introduce myself.

32:43.174 --> 32:47.745
No. I know who you are.

32:55.462 --> 33:00.300
I suppose sooner or later,
we have to decide where we're walk

33:00.005 --> 33:02.526
I have something I should call off.

33:02.725 --> 33:08.422
I'd never get to the place
where I start out for, anyway.

33:46.629 --> 33:47.523
Pardon.

33:47.716 --> 33:49.921
Excuse me.

33:50.118 --> 33:51.328
Very charming.

33:51.524 --> 33:51.972
Thank you.

33:52.325 --> 33:54.000
Anything else I can do for you,
Mr. Brand?

33:54.181 --> 33:55.129
Will you please tell Bowlish,

33:55.334 --> 33:58.082
I won't be at the rehearsal this evening.

33:58.277 --> 33:59.935
Congratulations.

34:00.134 --> 34:02.205
Fritz, is that gentleman free now?

34:02.406 --> 34:03.137
Just moment, sir.

34:03.332 --> 34:05.221
Don't you see I'm busy with Mr. Brand?

34:05.414 --> 34:09.504
Now... how about Lily?

34:09.701 --> 34:11.391
If she comes,
how am I going to tell her?

34:11.589 --> 34:12.766
Well, tell her...

34:12.965 --> 34:16.446
I'll tell her... It was most important
and you had to work.

34:16.645 --> 34:17.539
Yes, that's it. That's fine.

34:17.732 --> 34:18.496
I'm sure she will understand.

34:18.692 --> 34:19.139
I'm sure.

34:19.333 --> 34:19.648
Thank you.

34:20.248 --> 34:21.371
Bye.

34:21.605 --> 34:25.085
Stefan, I missed you yesterday.
I have to talk with you.

34:25.284 --> 34:26.649
Later.

34:26.116 --> 34:29.378
I saw the ? group at the conerto.
It's a young man I met...

34:29.734 --> 34:32.318
His father owns half of the...

34:32.677 --> 34:36.539
I thought it was something
for one of your concerts.

34:36.068 --> 34:36.962
If you just go outside...

34:37.157 --> 34:38.237
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

34:38.437 --> 34:41.284
Tomorrow...

34:57.092 --> 34:58.139
Now, don't be frightened.

34:58.500 --> 35:02.210
If it's not to becoming,
the lobster would have no intention.

35:02.404 --> 35:04.346
I was wrong. It is becoming.

35:04.549 --> 35:07.582
Let's see,
when do they have lobster again?

35:07.781 --> 35:09.374
Friday. How about Friday?

35:09.572 --> 35:11.263
A week is a long time.

35:11.460 --> 35:13.730
How about Wednesday.
That's pheasant.

35:13.957 --> 35:15.331
They have pheasant on Monday.

35:15.717 --> 35:17.147
Could you possibly make it on Monday?

35:17.348 --> 35:19.770
I've no engagement at all.

35:19.972 --> 35:23.071
I've none, either.
We'll have dinner tomorrow night.

35:23.428 --> 35:25.403
Wiener Schnitzel.

35:25.604 --> 35:28.539
Excuse me, Mr. Brand.
The lady in the next room,

35:28.260 --> 35:30.082
If I'm not mistaken,
it's The Countess Newesky.

35:30.277 --> 35:33.659
Would you sign her the program
of this afternoon's concert?

35:34.020 --> 35:35.299
Certainly.

35:34.980 --> 35:38.080
She said, Mozart
himself could not have done better.

35:38.020 --> 35:39.899
How nice of her.

35:40.004 --> 35:40.670
There you are.

35:41.499 --> 35:41.917
Thank the Countess for the compliment.

35:42.116 --> 35:43.609
Thank you, Mr. Braun.

35:43.076 --> 35:44.964
The note is not the least she deserves.

35:45.156 --> 35:47.263
Four years ago
when you played the D Minor.

35:47.460 --> 35:48.408
You remember that?

35:48.644 --> 35:50.466
The morning review, also.

35:50.660 --> 35:51.642
Compare too young Mozart.

35:52.259 --> 35:55.619
I was very young.

35:57.957 --> 36:00.772
You like it?

36:01.252 --> 36:02.910
Valpolicelli, it's called.

36:03.109 --> 36:06.622
First thing you see
when you come down the other side of the Alps.

36:07.009 --> 36:08.991
The Italians say,
it is such a good wine,

36:09.381 --> 36:11.966
Because the grapes have
their roots in the valley,

36:12.324 --> 36:14.495
And their eyes on the mountains.

36:14.692 --> 36:15.390
Please...

36:15.589 --> 36:17.498
Please what?

36:17.701 --> 36:20.484
Please talk about yourself.

36:20.676 --> 36:24.899
I believe you really want to hear about me.
Why?

36:25.093 --> 36:27.165
Uh, never mind why.

36:27.397 --> 36:31.073
The truth is,
I've had rather an easy time of it.

36:31.268 --> 36:34.301
People accepted my music very quickly.

36:34.532 --> 36:36.572
Perhaps too quickly.

36:37.399 --> 36:41.245
Sometimes it's easier
to please others than oneself.

36:41.444 --> 36:43.267
What're you going to say?

36:43.460 --> 36:45.053
You know you don't talk very much.

36:45.253 --> 36:47.293
Well... I can't say it very well. But...

36:47.493 --> 36:48.955
Yes.

36:49.189 --> 36:51.644
Sometimes,
I felt when you're playing that...

36:52.249 --> 36:53.667
Go on.

36:54.409 --> 36:59.556
That... you haven't quite found
what you're looking for.

37:01.317 --> 37:04.284
How long have you
been hiding in my piano?

37:04.484 --> 37:06.372
Uh, never mind explaining.

37:06.564 --> 37:09.020
I just assume you're a sorceress,

37:09.220 --> 37:12.962
And that
you can make yourself very tiny.

37:13.156 --> 37:16.287
It might be a good thing
to have a sorceress for a friend.

37:16.644 --> 37:19.393
Who knows?

37:19.589 --> 37:25.284
You maybe able to help me someday.

37:30.948 --> 37:33.119
How could I help you?

37:33.316 --> 37:36.350
So, that's what you've been thinking?

37:36.708 --> 37:38.946
You're a very strange girl.

37:39.140 --> 37:42.369
Who ever you are,
where ever you came from...

37:42.564 --> 37:43.611
Don't you have any problems?

37:43.929 --> 37:47.587
Not... important ones.

37:51.364 --> 37:56.732
It's been a long
while since anyone did that for me?

37:56.964 --> 37:57.793
Stop here, please.

37:57.988 --> 38:01.199
Woo... Ah.

38:05.156 --> 38:05.952
Good evening, Mr. Brand.

38:06.149 --> 38:07.743
Good evening.

38:07.940 --> 38:08.354
Roses?

38:08.548 --> 38:09.476
Yes. Please.

38:09.700 --> 38:10.234
Nice red ones?

38:10.436 --> 38:17.769
No. Red is the wrong color.
I think a single white rose would be perfect.

38:17.092 --> 38:19.459
This is a special occasion.

38:19.929 --> 38:20.412
Here you are. Good night.

38:20.772 --> 38:22.147
Good night, Mr. Brand.

38:22.340 --> 38:26.115
Enjoy yourself.

38:26.340 --> 38:27.518
Did I guess right?

38:27.716 --> 38:29.091
Is it your flower?

38:29.476 --> 38:31.964
From now on it will be.

38:32.324 --> 38:33.753
Would you like me to close it?

38:33.989 --> 38:34.687
No.

38:35.649 --> 38:40.580
Hah... and now to the park.

38:56.548 --> 38:57.628
Do you think it would all be close?

38:58.089 --> 39:00.643
I hope not.

39:02.116 --> 39:03.677
I never come here in the season.

39:04.036 --> 39:06.142
It's more pleasant in the winter.
I don't know why.

39:06.340 --> 39:07.288
It's perhaps...

39:07.493 --> 39:10.176
Because you prefer to imagine
how it will be in the spring.

39:10.372 --> 39:13.787
Because if it's spring,
then it's nothing to imagine and to wish for.

39:14.020 --> 39:16.560
Is there anything about
me you don't know?

39:16.100 --> 39:17.049
A few things.

39:17.412 --> 39:18.906
For instance, one thing I don't know,

39:19.109 --> 39:21.792
If one day they would
make a wax figure of you and put you in there.

39:21.989 --> 39:24.290
Because you'll be so famous.

39:24.484 --> 39:28.281
Well, if they do, will you pay your
penny to come in and see me?

39:28.484 --> 39:32.259
If you come alive.

39:41.604 --> 39:43.709
Now I see you as a little girl.

39:43.908 --> 39:46.723
You do?

39:48.196 --> 39:50.335
When my father was alive,
we travelled a lot.

39:50.532 --> 39:52.549
He went nearly everywhere.

39:52.068 --> 39:53.344
We've had a wonderful time.

39:53.540 --> 39:55.002
I didn't know you travelled so much.

39:55.205 --> 39:56.252
Oh, yes.

39:56.452 --> 39:59.219
Perhaps we've been in some
of the same places.

39:59.044 --> 40:01.129
No, I don't think so.

40:01.028 --> 40:02.049
Where did you go?

40:02.020 --> 40:03.907
Well, it was a long time. But...

40:04.132 --> 40:05.955
For instance, there was Rio de Janeiro.

40:06.308 --> 40:09.089
Beautiful, exotic,
real with its botanical garden.

40:09.188 --> 40:11.577
Its Avenue palms, Sugarloaf fountain,

40:11.781 --> 40:16.156
And the harbour where you can
look down and see the flying fishes...

40:16.357 --> 40:16.956
We're in Venice.

40:17.156 --> 40:18.051
Yes, we've arrived.

40:18.244 --> 40:21.375
Where would you like to go next?
France? England? Russia?

40:21.732 --> 40:22.015
Switzerland.

40:22.212 --> 40:22.681
Switzerland.

40:23.330 --> 40:28.548
Excuse me a moment
while I talk with the engineer.

40:30.917 --> 40:32.639
You and the lady,
are you enjoying the trip?

40:33.169 --> 40:36.480
Very much.
We're off to Switzerland.

40:36.676 --> 40:37.439
There you go. Thank you.

40:37.668 --> 40:40.286
Oh... thank you.

40:40.484 --> 40:42.721
Switzerland.

40:42.917 --> 40:44.029
Switzerland.

40:44.228 --> 40:47.043
Switzerland.

41:06.788 --> 41:10.716
So, you're looking
down at the flying fish. Then what?

41:10.917 --> 41:13.299
Aren't you going to finish the trip?

41:12.997 --> 41:15.649
Well, there weren't any trips,
do you mind?

41:15.109 --> 41:17.759
You see, my father
had a friend in the travel bureau.

41:17.956 --> 41:19.167
My father worked across the street.

41:19.363 --> 41:22.113
He was an assistant super
attendant of the municipal water?

41:22.308 --> 41:26.912
And he used to bring photos home
with pictures in them.

41:27.141 --> 41:28.482
And in the evening,
he'd put on his travelling coat.

41:29.169 --> 41:31.040
That's what he called it,
'Cause I was very young.

41:31.237 --> 41:32.763
And he'd say:
where should we go this evening?

41:32.964 --> 41:36.160
And I would say: Vera Cruz.
Because it's a beautiful name.

41:36.516 --> 41:38.785
And then he would say: um...
it's summer there,

41:38.980 --> 41:41.401
You don't want to roast
like a coffee bean, do you?

41:41.604 --> 41:42.781
So, you never did get there?

41:43.140 --> 41:45.726
No. It's just like I tripped the land
with the midnight sun.

41:46.116 --> 41:47.043
What stopped you this time?

41:47.236 --> 41:47.967
The weather.

41:48.196 --> 41:48.927
I thought of India.

41:49.123 --> 41:51.360
But then father remembered
it was the raining season.

41:51.556 --> 41:53.214
Your father was an expert on climates.

41:53.412 --> 41:54.241
My mother used to say that...

41:54.436 --> 41:58.234
He knew what the weather
was everywhere except home.

41:58.596 --> 41:59.196
What mountain was that?

41:59.556 --> 42:01.378
That's the Matterhorn.

42:01.572 --> 42:02.619
You've climbed it?

42:03.330 --> 42:03.746
Um hum.

42:03.940 --> 42:06.787
Tell me when you've climbed up
the mountain,
what then?

42:08.420 --> 42:14.116
Well, you come down again.

42:17.668 --> 42:20.209
Tell me more about your father.

42:20.036 --> 42:24.346
Well, then he finally did go away.

42:24.548 --> 42:25.922
He had the nicest eyes.

42:26.276 --> 42:29.374
Yes, I can see them.

42:29.572 --> 42:31.711
Why do you like to climb mountains?

42:32.069 --> 42:33.443
Well, I suppose because,

42:33.636 --> 42:37.459
No matter how high you climb,
there's always a higher one.

42:37.060 --> 42:39.427
And you like to imagine
that the other one is even more wonderful.

42:39.781 --> 42:40.162
Like the spring in the park.

42:40.388 --> 42:41.730
You know far too much about me already,

42:41.924 --> 42:44.706
And I know almost nothing about you

42:44.900 --> 42:49.505
Except you have travelled a great deal.

42:49.732 --> 42:54.336
End of the line.
All change.

42:54.532 --> 42:57.347
All change.

43:07.639 --> 43:08.028
What now?

43:08.228 --> 43:09.243
Where haven't we been?

43:09.604 --> 43:11.459
We have no more countries left.

43:11.652 --> 43:13.790
Then we'll begin all over again.

43:14.020 --> 43:17.598
There you are.
Thank you.

43:17.796 --> 43:21.593
We'll revisit the scenes of your youth.

43:49.060 --> 43:50.915
I don't know about them
but I'm going home.

43:51.109 --> 43:51.936
Right after this number.

43:52.132 --> 43:55.034
Me too, if he is not paying
me 50 quarters.

43:55.268 --> 44:02.458
I'd like to play for married people.
They've got homes.

44:12.323 --> 44:14.178
You're sorceress.

44:14.372 --> 44:18.715
Now I'm sure,
how else could we dance this way.

44:19.172 --> 44:22.303
Unless we've danced together before.

44:22.500 --> 44:28.196
And yet if we had,
should I remember it.

44:33.956 --> 44:37.199
Please.

45:10.564 --> 45:11.677
Promise me something.

45:12.569 --> 45:14.364
Anything.

45:14.596 --> 45:16.964
But I don't even know where you live.

45:17.156 --> 45:19.457
Promise me you won't vanish.

45:19.652 --> 45:25.348
I won't be the one who vanishes.

45:48.323 --> 45:48.955
We're here.

45:49.156 --> 45:52.003
Thank you.

46:02.596 --> 46:05.411
Thank you.

46:14.051 --> 46:14.913
Who is it?

46:15.109 --> 46:16.002
Brand.

46:16.196 --> 46:20.931
Good morning, Mr. Brand.

47:02.347 --> 47:05.664
Please be seated.

47:05.868 --> 47:08.835
Lisa, leave it on.
Someone wants to see it.

47:09.036 --> 47:09.602
Oh.

47:09.804 --> 47:15.500
Real customer. Looks like a good one.

47:16.569 --> 47:18.887
One moment.

47:22.119 --> 47:28.361
You'll like this one, I'm sure.
I'm sure.

47:29.900 --> 47:34.689
I like it very much.
Very much.

47:34.891 --> 47:36.386
How did you find me?

47:36.619 --> 47:38.081
I'm a good detective, what you think?

47:38.444 --> 47:42.119
You are.

47:47.319 --> 47:51.799
I'm afraid we have to put off
our play for tonight.

47:51.403 --> 47:54.054
I couldn't go away without seeing you.

47:54.719 --> 47:55.299
Where are you going?

47:55.403 --> 47:56.647
Milano.

47:56.844 --> 48:00.389
The whole orchestra is going.
We go to play at L'escala.

48:00.588 --> 48:02.824
It's wonderful.

48:03.020 --> 48:05.867
I've forgotten all about it.

48:06.730 --> 48:08.674
It won't be long.
Just two weeks.

48:09.036 --> 48:11.011
The train leaves at 5:30.

48:11.319 --> 48:14.375
Do you suppose you could see me off?

48:14.572 --> 48:15.466
I'll try.

48:15.819 --> 48:21.897
I'll look for you then.
Good bye. Thank you.

48:23.083 --> 48:28.779
Good-bye. You will be there.

48:29.324 --> 48:31.319
How did it go?

48:31.404 --> 48:32.713
He wasn't interested in the suit.

48:33.068 --> 48:36.101
But... Madam,
could I leave a bit earlier today?

48:36.300 --> 48:38.983
How early?
About 5:00.

48:39.181 --> 48:41.798
Yes.
Sure.

48:41.995 --> 48:43.108
Thank you, Madam.

48:43.307 --> 48:48.042
Congratulations, my dear.

49:07.820 --> 49:12.424
Stefan, the train is leaving.
Just a minute.

49:12.619 --> 49:16.362
How long have you been standing here?

49:16.556 --> 49:20.003
I don't want to go. Do you believe that?

49:20.599 --> 49:21.698
I'll be here when you get back.

49:22.059 --> 49:22.442
Come on.

49:22.636 --> 49:25.799
Yes.
Stefan, hurry, please.

49:25.995 --> 49:28.865
I still know so little about you.

49:29.068 --> 49:32.778
You like mystery.

49:32.971 --> 49:36.320
That a woman like you exist,
and I found you.

49:36.523 --> 49:39.338
That's mystery to me.

49:39.531 --> 49:43.492
Say "Stefan",
the way you said it last night.

49:43.692 --> 49:46.329
Stefan.

49:46.411 --> 49:47.873
As if you've said it all your life.

49:48.076 --> 49:48.457
Better hurry, sir.

49:48.812 --> 49:50.502
Yes.

49:50.859 --> 49:51.619
Good-bye.

49:51.436 --> 49:55.746
Stefan.
Good-bye.

49:56.011 --> 50:00.549
Won't be long.
I'll be back in two weeks.

50:03.339 --> 50:07.114
Good-bye. Two weeks.

50:22.443 --> 50:26.600
"Two weeks... Stefan,
how little you knew of yourself."

50:27.372 --> 50:33.068
"That train was taking
you out of my life."

51:08.460 --> 51:11.754
"He was a married man."

51:11.947 --> 51:15.722
"Does he live here in Vienna?"

51:16.107 --> 51:17.449
"If we knew who he was,"

51:17.644 --> 51:23.339
"He might be willing
to accept his responsibility."

51:24.747 --> 51:30.443
You won't tell us his name?

51:33.931 --> 51:37.127
But you haven't the means
to take care of the child.

51:37.323 --> 51:41.098
We'll get along.

51:41.676 --> 51:43.500
It's your duty to tell us.

51:43.404 --> 51:44.352
When a man does...

51:44.556 --> 51:49.826
I'm feeling tired.
Would you go?

51:52.172 --> 51:55.073
"You may wonder
why I never came to you for help."

51:55.467 --> 51:59.029
"I wanted to be one woman
you've had known,"

51:58.507 --> 52:00.842
"Who had asked you for nothing."

52:01.480 --> 52:05.024
"My deep regret is
that you never saw your son."

52:05.489 --> 52:09.984
"There were times during those years,
I prefer not to remember."

52:10.188 --> 52:12.130
"But this I can assure you,"

52:12.331 --> 52:17.187
"Whatever the cost,
he'd repaid me a thousand times."

52:17.547 --> 52:20.449
"You'd have been proud of him, too."

52:20.683 --> 52:22.538
"When he was almost nine."

52:22.764 --> 52:26.442
"As much for his sake as mine,
I married."

52:26.668 --> 52:28.490
"You know who my husband is."

52:28.684 --> 52:30.571
"Johann Stauffer asked to marry me."

52:30.923 --> 52:33.705
"Knowing the truth about us,
and about our child."

52:33.899 --> 52:34.946
Oh. How lovely.

52:35.179 --> 52:37.667
Thank you, Johann.

52:37.867 --> 52:39.629
What a nice birthday!

52:39.596 --> 52:41.768
This..., and Stefan home.

52:41.963 --> 52:44.330
You know,
I'm not good at saying such things.

52:44.523 --> 52:48.582
But... Lisa, I want you to be
as happy as you've made be.

52:48.780 --> 52:55.173
If I were really deserving why,
I'll be ready on time.

52:55.371 --> 52:58.389
You are happy?

53:02.155 --> 53:03.781
You are?

53:03.980 --> 53:07.754
"Why shouldn't I be?"

53:08.879 --> 53:12.042
Let's say good night.

53:15.628 --> 53:18.944
Is he another talent?

53:19.179 --> 53:24.875
He has a lot of talents,
but not for finishing his milk.

53:26.571 --> 53:28.611
Or for brushing his teeth.

53:28.812 --> 53:29.989
Made in Switzerland.

53:30.347 --> 53:33.379
Switzerland must be a very nice place,
don't you think?

53:33.419 --> 53:34.596
Who gave it to you, darling?

53:34.795 --> 53:35.527
Herr Frank.

53:35.723 --> 53:36.617
Who's Herr Frank?

53:36.811 --> 53:37.739
His music teacher.

53:38.091 --> 53:40.001
He said that he thinks
that I've a natural talent.

53:40.569 --> 53:41.317
For harmonica?

53:41.515 --> 53:43.784
No. For music.

53:43.980 --> 53:46.663
Oh.

53:46.859 --> 53:47.807
Good night, Stefan.

53:48.012 --> 53:50.980
Good night, Sir.

53:51.179 --> 53:52.073
Good night, darling.

53:52.427 --> 53:56.500
Good night, mother.

53:58.828 --> 53:59.394
Mother!

53:59.628 --> 54:00.521
Yes!

54:00.748 --> 54:04.522
I'll be right back.

54:05.835 --> 54:08.323
You remember the last time,
first night I was home from school.

54:08.683 --> 54:09.665
Um-hum, what about it?

54:09.867 --> 54:12.769
When you went out,
you let me sleep in your room.

54:12.620 --> 54:12.935
Alright.

54:13.131 --> 54:15.465
It's a special concession
because it's your first night home.

54:15.659 --> 54:19.434
But hurry. I'm late.

54:22.763 --> 54:25.513
In just a minute.
There's no hurry.

54:25.708 --> 54:26.918
Good night, Sir.

54:27.147 --> 54:29.962
Good night.

54:33.996 --> 54:35.752
You know, Stefan, it might be nicer...

54:35.947 --> 54:39.013
If you could say "Good night,
father!"instead of „Good night, Sir"

54:39.371 --> 54:40.746
But I've always said it that way.

54:40.971 --> 54:44.000
I think he'd like it
if you could manage to change it.

54:43.403 --> 54:45.475
Suppose you said to me
"Good night, Madam."

54:45.675 --> 54:48.130
It would sound pretty silly, wouldn't it?

54:48.331 --> 54:50.917
Now, promise me you'd go to sleep,
and not wait up for me.

54:51.116 --> 54:52.043
I promise.

54:52.569 --> 54:53.829
Would you bring me
the program of the opera?

54:54.027 --> 54:56.842
I promise.

54:58.027 --> 54:59.783
Good night, Madam.

54:59.980 --> 55:01.605
Good night, Sir.

55:01.803 --> 55:04.803
After all when a person treats
you so much like his son,

55:05.035 --> 55:06.661
he is in a sense your father.

55:06.859 --> 55:08.835
Alright, mother, if you say so.

55:09.195 --> 55:12.043
Good night.

55:20.559 --> 55:24.675
"The course of our lives can
be changed by such little things"

55:24.876 --> 55:30.039
"So many passing by,
each intent on his own problems."

55:29.483 --> 55:35.047
"So many faces,
that one might be easily lost."

55:35.639 --> 55:39.520
"I know now. Nothing happens by chance."

55:39.915 --> 55:46.407
"Every moment is measured.
Every step is counted."

55:46.603 --> 55:48.391
Curtain. Curtain going up.

55:48.587 --> 55:49.350
Second act.

55:49.547 --> 55:54.567
Curtain going up. Second act.

55:54.763 --> 55:57.000
Look! Isn't that Stefan Brand?

55:57.480 --> 55:59.463
He played last week.
Is that a concert tour?

55:59.659 --> 56:02.059
Pleasure trip, most likely.

56:01.483 --> 56:07.877
The way he's burning himself up,
it's a wonder he's still alive.

56:08.076 --> 56:10.858
Ten years ago, he showed great promise.

56:11.052 --> 56:12.099
Too bad.

56:12.491 --> 56:15.393
With that talent,
he could've been a great pianist.

56:15.596 --> 56:17.352
Perhaps talent is not enough.

56:17.547 --> 56:19.817
Perhaps he's have too many talents.

56:20.172 --> 56:21.000
Second act!

56:21.195 --> 56:24.971
Curtain going up!

56:34.367 --> 56:35.894
Sorry.

56:36.096 --> 56:36.956
We're late.

56:37.152 --> 56:39.835
You know the colonel Kohner...

56:40.031 --> 56:41.657
Everyone is asking for you.

56:41.855 --> 56:42.684
You've made a conquest.

56:42.879 --> 56:48.576
My dear, you should have joined us.

57:07.819 --> 57:10.907
"Suddenly, in that one moment."

57:11.103 --> 57:13.012
"Everything was in danger."

57:13.407 --> 57:15.895
"Everything I thought was safe."

57:16.255 --> 57:22.398
"Somewhere out there were your eyes.
And I knew I couldn't escape them."

57:22.591 --> 57:25.079
"It's like the first time I saw you."

57:25.279 --> 57:30.829
"The years between were melting away."

57:30.911 --> 57:31.577
I have a headache.

57:32.460 --> 57:32.058
I'll take you home.

57:32.255 --> 57:33.182
No. Please don't worry.

57:33.535 --> 57:38.685
I'll be alright.
Please stay here.

57:51.263 --> 57:52.986
Would you be kind enough
to give my husband a message.

57:53.183 --> 57:55.139
He's in 17. Not now.

57:54.943 --> 57:55.891
But after the show.

57:56.096 --> 57:58.135
Tell him, I've decided to go home.
Tell him not to worry.

57:58.495 --> 58:01.310
Thank you.

58:10.911 --> 58:11.893
Call my carriage, please.

58:12.096 --> 58:14.462
Yes, Madam.

58:14.815 --> 58:15.230
Sergeant!

58:15.455 --> 58:18.270
Yes, Madam.

58:47.007 --> 58:48.317
Excuse me.

58:48.543 --> 58:50.615
You must realized
that where there's a pursuit.

58:50.815 --> 58:53.150
And there'd also be a pursuer.

58:53.343 --> 58:56.506
I've seen you somewhere, I know.

58:57.099 --> 58:58.045
I followed you upstairs.

58:58.239 --> 58:59.800
And watched you in your box.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.366
But I couldn't place you.

59:02.899 --> 59:05.850
And I had to speak with you.

59:06.047 --> 59:10.487
I know how it sounds.
I assure you in this case that it's true.

59:10.899 --> 59:13.629
Believe that, don't you?

59:12.991 --> 59:14.814
Yes.
Thank you.

59:15.167 --> 59:16.663
Now please, just a moment.

59:16.864 --> 59:20.245
Is there any place we could have met,
that I might have seen you?

59:20.447 --> 59:23.000
At one of my concerts?

59:23.199 --> 59:25.629
There must have been sometime ago.

59:25.022 --> 59:28.056
I haven't given any concerts
in Vienna lately.

59:28.255 --> 59:30.841
Or anywhere else in that matter.

59:31.039 --> 59:33.460
You don't play anymore?

59:33.663 --> 59:35.550
Oh, it's not quite as final as that.

59:36.139 --> 59:38.426
I always tell myself that,
"Beginning next week."

59:38.623 --> 59:40.663
And when next week comes,
it's this week.

59:41.023 --> 59:42.616
So, I wait for next week again.

59:42.975 --> 59:45.364
What are you waiting for?

59:45.567 --> 59:47.127
It's a very disturbing question.

59:47.327 --> 59:47.926
My carriage...

59:48.127 --> 59:51.542
You can't ask such a question,
and just walk away.

59:52.139 --> 59:55.139
I have a feeling...
please don't think I'm mad.

59:54.943 --> 59:58.489
I know it sounds strange.
I can't explain it.

59:58.687 --> 01:00:03.607
But I feel that you understand
what I can't even say.

01:00:03.807 --> 01:00:07.255
And that you can help me.

01:00:07.455 --> 01:00:13.152
Have you ever shopped
for places like cards,

01:00:13.695 --> 01:00:14.939
Hoping to find the one...

01:00:15.135 --> 01:00:18.681
Lies somewhere at the edge
of your memory.

01:00:18.879 --> 01:00:21.913
The one you've been waiting for.

01:00:22.271 --> 01:00:24.376
But tonight, when I first saw you.

01:00:24.576 --> 01:00:27.128
And later
when I watched you in the darkness.

01:00:27.326 --> 01:00:31.898
It looked like one face amongst others.

01:00:32.126 --> 01:00:34.942
Who are you?

01:00:36.318 --> 01:00:39.500
Promise me, I'll see you again.
I must see you.

01:00:38.911 --> 01:00:41.969
I don't know.

01:01:03.809 --> 01:01:09.406
Johann,
you don't think I want this to happen?

01:01:10.431 --> 01:01:12.373
What are you going to do?

01:01:12.576 --> 01:01:15.390
I don't know.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.828
Lisa. We have a marriage.

01:01:20.031 --> 01:01:22.933
Perhaps it's not all you once
hoped for. But...

01:01:23.135 --> 01:01:27.161
You've a home, and your son.
People who care for you.

01:01:27.519 --> 01:01:29.428
I know that, Johann.

01:01:29.631 --> 01:01:31.321
I'll do anything to avoid hurting you.

01:01:31.551 --> 01:01:35.179
But I can't help it.

01:01:35.103 --> 01:01:37.208
And your son?

01:01:37.407 --> 01:01:39.163
Can you avoid hurting him?

01:01:39.359 --> 01:01:44.116
He won't be harmed I'll see to that.

01:01:44.319 --> 01:01:49.534
There're such things as honor,
and decency.

01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:52.062
I told myself that hundred times
this one evening.

01:01:52.447 --> 01:01:54.935
You talk like it is out of your hands.

01:01:55.294 --> 01:01:58.523
It's not, Lisa.
You have a will.

01:01:59.219 --> 01:02:01.686
You can do what's right,
what's best for you.

01:02:02.047 --> 01:02:04.152
Or you can throw away your life.

01:02:04.351 --> 01:02:07.429
I've had no hope but his ever.

01:02:06.975 --> 01:02:09.339
That's romantic nonsense.

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:10.388
Is it?

01:02:11.210 --> 01:02:12.029
Johann, I can't help it.

01:02:11.935 --> 01:02:14.074
I can't dispute that.

01:02:14.271 --> 01:02:19.541
What about him?
Can't he help himself, either?

01:02:20.606 --> 01:02:24.381
I know now that he needs me
as much as I've always needed him.

01:02:24.606 --> 01:02:27.803
Isn't it a bit late for him
to find that out?

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:32.439
We're home, Sir.

01:02:41.663 --> 01:02:43.139
Good night.

01:02:42.942 --> 01:02:46.879
Good night, Sir.

01:02:59.614 --> 01:03:04.830
Lisa. If you do this,
you can never turn back.

01:03:05.022 --> 01:03:06.299
You know that, don't you?

01:03:06.494 --> 01:03:09.309
Yes.

01:03:13.247 --> 01:03:17.404
I warn you. I shall do everything in
my power to prevent it.

01:03:49.379 --> 01:03:50.109
Hello, darling. Wake up.

01:03:51.327 --> 01:03:57.022
It's time to go to your own room.

01:03:59.199 --> 01:04:00.987
Did you have a nice time?

01:04:01.183 --> 01:04:03.998
Yes, darling.

01:04:04.864 --> 01:04:06.357
Good night, father.

01:04:06.899 --> 01:04:08.606
Good night.

01:04:08.799 --> 01:04:10.522
Did you hear? I just said it.

01:04:10.899 --> 01:04:12.573
Yes, darling.

01:04:13.379 --> 01:04:18.463
Tell me about the opera...
was it exciting?

01:04:24.384 --> 01:04:25.015
How's that?

01:04:25.214 --> 01:04:27.931
You're wonderful.

01:04:28.127 --> 01:04:31.902
You're wonderful.

01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:35.005
You've always been a wonderful boy.

01:04:35.199 --> 01:04:38.559
You know how much that it's meant to me?

01:04:37.982 --> 01:04:41.277
Be so proud of you, always.

01:04:41.471 --> 01:04:44.318
I know it.

01:05:10.335 --> 01:05:12.855
Don't worry, mother.

01:05:13.054 --> 01:05:15.672
Two weeks will go like an express train.

01:05:15.871 --> 01:05:17.016
You sure you're coming?

01:05:17.215 --> 01:05:18.163
Of course. I promise.

01:05:18.399 --> 01:05:20.188
You can even get
my room in the village for me.

01:05:20.543 --> 01:05:22.038
I'll get you the same
one you're there last time.

01:05:22.398 --> 01:05:24.308
The one with the balcony.

01:05:24.511 --> 01:05:30.207
Didn't I tell you
that compartment was quarantined?

01:05:30.655 --> 01:05:31.548
I'm sorry, Madam.

01:05:32.129 --> 01:05:34.197
This compartment had to be closed up.

01:05:34.399 --> 01:05:35.925
I'll take you to the next cart forwards.

01:05:36.127 --> 01:05:38.909
That's good.
I'll be near the locomotive.

01:05:39.103 --> 01:05:42.877
I'll take the box.

01:05:44.030 --> 01:05:46.250
Do we have two locomotives
on our train?

01:05:45.951 --> 01:05:47.608
We usually get along with one.

01:05:47.807 --> 01:05:49.869
But I will talk to the engineer.

01:05:49.919 --> 01:05:52.286
How about that one over there?
You can have two seats in there.

01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:54.682
He's travelling alone.

01:05:55.038 --> 01:05:56.413
Don't worry about it, Madam.

01:05:56.639 --> 01:05:57.467
I'll take good care of him.

01:05:57.663 --> 01:05:59.353
We leave in about a minute.

01:05:59.550 --> 01:06:02.579
Better hurry and get your seat.

01:06:01.982 --> 01:06:03.990
You'll see better if you sit over here.

01:06:04.190 --> 01:06:05.914
And if you get chilly,
you can put up the window.

01:06:06.143 --> 01:06:08.925
Yes, mother.

01:06:09.119 --> 01:06:13.974
Stefan. You know how I've
longed for you to being home.

01:06:14.335 --> 01:06:16.157
And now I can't even explain.

01:06:16.318 --> 01:06:19.635
I hope some day, very soon...
I'll be able to give you a reason.

01:06:19.998 --> 01:06:24.089
But now, you just have to believe
that it's for your own good.

01:06:24.288 --> 01:06:25.913
I don't mind going back so much.

01:06:26.143 --> 01:06:28.183
Especially when you're coming so soon.

01:06:28.542 --> 01:06:29.687
It'd be like two vocations.

01:06:29.887 --> 01:06:31.064
Alright, darling.

01:06:31.422 --> 01:06:34.389
I'll show you the new walk
we found since you're there last time.

01:06:34.591 --> 01:06:38.366
Better get out, lady.

01:06:42.559 --> 01:06:44.282
You'll write me often, won't you?

01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:50.807
Yes mother. But I can't write very often.
We've only two weeks.

01:06:51.007 --> 01:06:57.000
Good-bye, mother. Two weeks.

01:07:29.375 --> 01:07:32.221
Make way, please.

01:07:32.414 --> 01:07:34.599
Make way, please.

01:07:33.982 --> 01:07:37.679
What happened?

01:07:37.087 --> 01:07:38.581
Someone hurt?

01:07:39.529 --> 01:07:40.027
No reason to get alarmed.

01:07:40.223 --> 01:07:41.467
They said that it's typhus.

01:07:41.663 --> 01:07:42.164
Typhus?

01:07:42.558 --> 01:07:47.293
Yes. Typhus on the train.

01:08:01.375 --> 01:08:01.876
Yes. Madam.

01:08:02.078 --> 01:08:04.183
Yes. Is Mr. Brand here? Stefan Brand.

01:08:04.542 --> 01:08:09.299
Brand? One moment, please.

01:08:09.535 --> 01:08:10.942
Fritz!

01:08:11.262 --> 01:08:13.848
Um?

01:08:17.598 --> 01:08:20.447
Could you tell me has Mr. Brand
been here this evening?

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:23.645
Oh, Mr. Brand is no longer
a customer of ours.

01:08:23.837 --> 01:08:25.300
Not for sometime.

01:08:25.662 --> 01:08:28.596
Mr. Brand these days
is more likely to be found at the Ritz.

01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:31.645
Thank you.

01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:01.661
Good evening, Madam.

01:09:01.854 --> 01:09:04.572
I still have nice flowers left.
I'm closing up.

01:09:05.368 --> 01:09:10.331
And I've saved you
a nice bouquet. Very cheap.

01:09:14.270 --> 01:09:18.011
I'll take those, the white ones.

01:09:18.367 --> 01:09:19.479
Don't bother wrapping them up.

01:09:19.679 --> 01:09:23.453
Doesn't matter.

01:10:07.007 --> 01:10:11.318
Now, drive.
Drive on!

01:10:35.210 --> 01:10:39.485
Stefan Brand. Is he in?

01:10:48.318 --> 01:10:51.134
Thank you.

01:11:36.639 --> 01:11:38.134
This is a surprise.

01:11:38.494 --> 01:11:41.015
But I assure you're a very happy one.

01:11:41.375 --> 01:11:46.644
John didn't prepare me
for such pleasant occasion.

01:11:47.006 --> 01:11:48.894
I thought last night...

01:11:49.086 --> 01:11:52.533
The darkness might've
played tricks with my eyes.

01:11:52.894 --> 01:11:55.416
You're even more
beautiful than I imagined.

01:11:56.449 --> 01:11:57.083
Very kind of you.

01:11:57.310 --> 01:12:00.408
This is just the hour
for a bit late supper.

01:12:00.606 --> 01:12:01.533
Or is it too late?

01:12:01.970 --> 01:12:03.449
Oh, it makes no difference.
You're here.

01:12:03.646 --> 01:12:06.646
As far as I'm concerned,
all the clocks in the world have stopped.

01:12:06.846 --> 01:12:08.570
Excuse me a moment.

01:12:09.369 --> 01:12:10.555
John!

01:12:10.943 --> 01:12:12.470
John, I'm sorry to send you out so late.

01:12:12.863 --> 01:12:14.871
Would you go out to the corner,
and get a few things.

01:12:15.070 --> 01:12:21.369
We're going to have supper.
The usual things.

01:12:25.502 --> 01:12:29.528
John makes life possible for
a hopelessly single man.

01:12:29.970 --> 01:12:32.246
She fascinates you, too!

01:12:32.479 --> 01:12:33.242
Do you remember...

01:12:33.438 --> 01:12:36.155
The Greeks built a
statue to a God they didn't know.

01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:38.554
But hoped someday would come to them.

01:12:38.911 --> 01:12:40.820
But mine happened to be a Goddess.

01:12:41.023 --> 01:12:43.324
And you've never found her?

01:12:43.679 --> 01:12:46.068
For years, I never woke in the morning,

01:12:46.462 --> 01:12:48.568
but I said to myself,

01:12:49.369 --> 01:12:53.501
"Perhaps today she will come.
My life will really begin."

01:12:53.970 --> 01:12:57.043
Sometimes it seemed very near.

01:12:57.246 --> 01:13:02.844
But now I'm older, and I know better.

01:13:03.487 --> 01:13:05.939
Even for yourself,
you don't play anymore?

01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:09.595
Oh, I remember last night,
you're kind enough to be interested...

01:13:10.609 --> 01:13:11.679
I forgot John locked
it when I went away.

01:13:11.871 --> 01:13:14.621
Nowadays, I'm away quite a lot of time.

01:13:14.815 --> 01:13:19.037
I'll ask him for the key
when he comes back.

01:13:19.230 --> 01:13:20.953
You are very lovely.

01:13:21.150 --> 01:13:22.427
It's a beautiful dress.

01:13:22.622 --> 01:13:24.215
Thank you.

01:13:24.414 --> 01:13:27.318
How could you do that?
Give it up altogether.

01:13:27.679 --> 01:13:30.264
Well, if you're so curious,
I'll tell you.

01:13:30.622 --> 01:13:33.045
One night I came back to this room.

01:13:33.246 --> 01:13:35.668
I had given a concert like
all the others.

01:13:35.903 --> 01:13:38.520
Not bad, and not worse.

01:13:38.389 --> 01:13:41.185
Afterwards,
they said all the usual things.

01:13:41.387 --> 01:13:44.550
The things you say
when you are not really convinced.

01:13:44.746 --> 01:13:45.827
So, I happened to look into the mirror.

01:13:46.527 --> 01:13:49.079
This one here.

01:13:49.278 --> 01:13:51.699
The young protégée was no longer young.

01:13:51.903 --> 01:13:55.033
Certainly wasn't perpetual.

01:13:55.230 --> 01:13:57.849
Since then, I found other things to do.

01:13:58.046 --> 01:14:01.822
More amusing things.

01:14:06.590 --> 01:14:12.287
I knew last night. Didn't you?

01:14:27.614 --> 01:14:32.054
I haven't even
offered to fix you a drink.

01:14:32.255 --> 01:14:32.636
Stefan?

01:14:32.990 --> 01:14:34.965
Yes.

01:14:35.166 --> 01:14:38.550
I came here...
I have something to tell you.

01:14:37.983 --> 01:14:39.291
If it has something to do with you,
l'm very interested.

01:14:39.646 --> 01:14:41.240
It has to do with us.

01:14:41.599 --> 01:14:44.447
We can't possible
be serious this early in the morning.

01:14:44.670 --> 01:14:46.012
At least not without
a glass of champagne.

01:14:46.367 --> 01:14:49.684
Won't take a minute.

01:14:49.886 --> 01:14:53.367
Champagne tastes much better
after midnight, don't you think?

01:14:54.167 --> 01:14:55.279
Much better.

01:14:55.638 --> 01:14:56.718
I've just came back from America.

01:14:56.919 --> 01:14:58.445
It's a fascinating country.

01:14:58.646 --> 01:14:59.955
The men are fond of money.

01:15:00.409 --> 01:15:02.612
And their wives... are fond of Europeans.

01:15:02.806 --> 01:15:04.464
Must have been a wonderful trip?

01:15:04.663 --> 01:15:09.201
Have you travelled a great deal?

01:15:09.789 --> 01:15:14.594
I couldn't get
you out of my mind all day.

01:15:15.629 --> 01:15:16.476
No, I don't believe you.

01:15:16.674 --> 01:15:18.431
If I only knew you're coming...

01:15:18.627 --> 01:15:19.673
To tell you the truth,

01:15:20.034 --> 01:15:22.455
I never dared to hope
that you could arranged it so soon.

01:15:23.299 --> 01:15:25.753
But you're so clever,
you managed so beautifully.

01:15:25.954 --> 01:15:29.052
You know, you're a very strange woman.

01:15:29.282 --> 01:15:30.230
Am I?

01:15:30.594 --> 01:15:35.678
Something you've said last night,
it keeps running through my mind.

01:15:36.549 --> 01:15:37.401
What was that?

01:15:37.602 --> 01:15:42.043
I'll tell you in just a moment
as soon as I get the ice.

01:15:42.243 --> 01:15:44.993
Are you getting lonely out there?

01:15:45.186 --> 01:15:48.034
Very lonely.

01:15:52.610 --> 01:15:55.600
"I come to tell you about us."

01:15:55.106 --> 01:15:57.922
"To offer you my whole life."

01:15:58.114 --> 01:16:03.909
"But you didn't even remember me."

01:16:39.971 --> 01:16:42.458
Can I take you somewhere, young lady?

01:16:42.690 --> 01:16:45.342
Anywhere at all?

01:16:45.538 --> 01:16:50.273
It makes no difference.

01:17:09.954 --> 01:17:12.409
"I don't remember where I went."

01:17:12.610 --> 01:17:14.585
"Time will pass me."

01:17:14.786 --> 01:17:16.793
"Not in days, or in hours."

01:17:17.154 --> 01:17:21.440
"But in the distance
that put between us."

01:17:21.058 --> 01:17:24.353
"Now I think again.
I went to my son."

01:17:24.706 --> 01:17:27.008
"But it was too late."

01:17:27.201 --> 01:17:30.518
"He died last night of typhus."

01:17:30.722 --> 01:17:34.669
"Without even knowing I was there."

01:17:34.083 --> 01:17:36.503
"Now I'm all alone."

01:17:36.739 --> 01:17:40.535
"My head throbs,
and my temples are burning."

01:17:40.770 --> 01:17:46.007
"Perhaps God has been kind.
and I too have caught the fever."

01:17:46.210 --> 01:17:50.172
"If this letter reaches you,
believe this..."

01:17:50.370 --> 01:17:54.145
"That I love you now as
I've always loved you."

01:17:54.498 --> 01:17:55.446
"My life can be measured...

01:17:55.650 --> 01:17:59.611
"By the moments
that I've had with you and our child."

01:17:59.909 --> 01:18:03.290
"If only you could've shared
those moments."

01:18:03.490 --> 01:18:07.418
"If only you could've recognized
what was always yours."

01:18:07.618 --> 01:18:10.781
"Could've found what was never lost."

01:18:10.978 --> 01:18:13.793
"If only..."

01:19:53.922 --> 01:19:57.696
You remembered her?

01:20:16.034 --> 01:20:19.299
Lisa...

01:20:22.114 --> 01:20:24.766
Lisa...

01:20:58.946 --> 01:21:02.721
Bring my things.

01:21:29.954 --> 01:21:33.730
Ready, gentleman?

01:21:36.257 --> 01:21:40.382
"If only you could've recognized
what was always yours."

01:21:40.737 --> 01:21:46.433
"Could've found what was never lost..."
