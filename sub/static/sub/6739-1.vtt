00:44.546 --> 00:48.446
Watch that line, now.
Watch that line.

00:48.547 --> 00:51.947
{y:i} - Po Lazarus
{y:i} - Po Lazarus!

00:51.947 --> 00:54.848
{y:i} Po Lazarus...

00:54.948 --> 01:00.149
{y:i} Well, the high sheriff,
{y:i} he told the deputy

01:00.149 --> 01:07.351
{y:i} Won't you go out
{y:i} and bring me Lazarus?

01:07.951 --> 01:12.852
{y:i} Well, the high sheriff,
{y:i} he told the deputy

01:12.952 --> 01:20.854
{y:i} Won't you go out
{y:i} and bring me Lazarus?

01:20.854 --> 01:24.055
{y:i} Oh, bring him dead or alive

01:24.255 --> 01:25.855
{y:i} O Lord

01:26.055 --> 01:30.656
{y:i} Bring him dead or alive

01:31.356 --> 01:36.357
{y:i} Well, the deputy,
{y:i} he told the high sheriff

01:36.357 --> 01:43.259
{y:i} Well, I ain't gonna mess
{y:i} with Lazarus

01:44.059 --> 01:48.060
{y:i} Well, the deputy,
{y:i} he told the high sheriff

01:48.060 --> 01:54.662
{y:i} Said I ain't gonna mess
{y:i} with Lazarus...

01:54.662 --> 01:59.363
- Pick up that hammer, boy.
- Yes, sir, boss.

01:59.463 --> 02:02.963
{y:i} Well, he's a dangerous man

02:03.063 --> 02:10.065
{y:i} O Lord, he's a dangerous man...

02:10.365 --> 02:14.566
Go on, hit it! Go!

02:24.568 --> 02:27.069
{y:i} One evening as the sun went down

02:27.169 --> 02:29.569
{y:i} And the jungle fire was burning

02:29.769 --> 02:32.170
{y:i} Down the track came a hobo hikin'

02:32.270 --> 02:34.771
{y:i} And he said, boys, I'm not turning

02:34.771 --> 02:37.571
{y:i} I'm headed for a land
{y:i} that's far away

02:37.671 --> 02:39.972
{y:i} Beside the crystal fountains

02:40.072 --> 02:44.973
{y:i} So come with me, we'll go and see
{y:i} the big rock candy mountains

02:44.973 --> 02:47.473
{y:i} In the big rock candy mountains

02:47.674 --> 02:50.074
{y:i} There's a land
{y:i} that's fair and bright

02:50.174 --> 02:52.375
{y:i} Where the handouts grow on bushes

02:52.575 --> 02:55.175
{y:i} And you sleep out every night

02:55.275 --> 02:57.676
{y:i} Where the boxcars all are empty

02:57.776 --> 02:59.476
{y:i} And the sun shines every day

02:59.576 --> 03:02.877
{y:i} On the birds and the bees
{y:i} and the cigarette trees

03:02.977 --> 03:04.977
{y:i} The lemonade springs
{y:i} where the bluebird sings

03:05.177 --> 03:08.878
{y:i} In the big rock candy mountains

03:08.878 --> 03:11.179
{y:i} In the big rock candy mountains

03:11.379 --> 03:13.679
{y:i} All the cops have wooden legs

03:13.879 --> 03:16.280
{y:i} And the bulldogs
{y:i} all have rubber teeth

03:16.480 --> 03:18.781
{y:i} And the hens lay soft-boiled eggs

03:18.881 --> 03:21.181
{y:i} The farmers' trees
{y:i} are full of fruit

03:21.281 --> 03:23.582
{y:i} And the barns are full of hay

03:23.682 --> 03:25.882
{y:i} Oh, I'm bound to go
{y:i} where there ain't no snow

03:26.082 --> 03:28.283
{y:i} Where the rain don't fall,
{y:i} the wind don't blow

03:28.383 --> 03:31.984
{y:i} In the big rock candy mountains

03:31.984 --> 03:34.384
{y:i} In the big rock candy mountains

03:34.484 --> 03:36.585
{y:i} You never change your socks

03:36.685 --> 03:38.985
{y:i} And the little streams of alcohol

03:39.185 --> 03:41.386
{y:i} Come a-trickling down the rocks

03:41.486 --> 03:43.786
{y:i} The brakemen have to tip their hats

03:43.886 --> 03:46.087
{y:i} And the railroad bulls are blind

03:46.187 --> 03:48.587
{y:i} There's a lake of stew
{y:i} and of whiskey, too

03:48.687 --> 03:50.888
{y:i} You can paddle all around 'em
{y:i} in a big canoe

03:51.088 --> 03:54.889
{y:i} In the big rock
{y:i} candy mountains...

03:57.089 --> 03:59.090
{y:i} The jails are made of tin

03:59.290 --> 04:01.290
{y:i} And you can walk right out again

04:01.490 --> 04:03.891
{y:i} As soon as you are in

04:03.991 --> 04:06.091
{y:i} There ain't no
{y:i} short-handle shovels

04:06.191 --> 04:08.392
{y:i} No axes, saws or picks

04:08.492 --> 04:10.992
{y:i} I'm a-goin' to stay
{y:i} where you sleep all day

04:11.092 --> 04:12.993
{y:i} Where they hung the jerk
{y:i} that invented work

04:13.193 --> 04:17.194
{y:i} In the big rock candy mountains

04:22.595 --> 04:24.696
{y:i} I'll see you all this comin' fall

04:24.896 --> 04:28.896
{y:i} In the big rock candy mountains

05:03.104 --> 05:04.405
Say,

05:04.605 --> 05:08.205
any of you boys smithies?

05:09.106 --> 05:10.706
Or if not smithies per se

05:10.706 --> 05:13.507
were you otherwise trained
in the metallurgic arts

05:12.706 --> 05:17.608
before straitened circumstances forced
you into a life of aimless wanderin'?

05:26.109 --> 05:29.110
Jesus! Can't I count on you people?

05:29.210 --> 05:30.911
Sorry, Everett.

05:31.111 --> 05:35.812
Well, all right.
...we take off through that bayou...

05:35.912 --> 05:37.212
Wait a minute!

05:37.412 --> 05:40.013
Who elected you leader of this outfit?

05:40.013 --> 05:43.913
Pete, I figured it should be the one
with the capacity for abstract thought,

05:44.114 --> 05:47.114
but if that ain't the consensus'
view, then hell, let's put it to a vote.

05:47.214 --> 05:49.715
Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly.

05:49.815 --> 05:53.716
Well, I'm votin' for yours truly, too.

05:56.816 --> 06:00.217
OK, I'm with you fellas.

06:23.222 --> 06:26.123
Mind if we join you, old-timer?

06:26.223 --> 06:31.424
Join me, m'son. Join me.

06:32.324 --> 06:35.525
You work for the railroad, Grandpa?

06:35.725 --> 06:37.926
I work for no man.

06:38.126 --> 06:42.127
- You got a name, do you?
- I have no name.

06:42.227 --> 06:46.328
That right there may be the reason
you had difficulty finding employment.

06:46.428 --> 06:49.328
Y'see, in the mart of competitive commerce...

06:49.528 --> 06:51.329
You seek a great fortune,

06:51.429 --> 06:53.929
you three who are now in chains.

06:54.129 --> 06:56.830
You will find a fortune,

06:56.930 --> 07:00.231
though it will not be
the fortune you seek.

07:00.331 --> 07:02.431
But first...

07:02.631 --> 07:08.433
first you must travel a
long and difficult road,

07:08.533 --> 07:13.234
a road fraught with peril, mm-hmm.

07:13.334 --> 07:16.334
You shall see things...

07:16.434 --> 07:18.535
wonderful to tell.

07:18.735 --> 07:22.136
You shall see a... a cow...

07:22.336 --> 07:26.837
on the roof of a cotton house, ha.

07:26.937 --> 07:31.238
And, oh, so many startling sights.

07:31.238 --> 07:34.339
I cannot tell you how
long this road shall be,

07:34.539 --> 07:37.739
but fear not the obstacles in your path,

07:37.739 --> 07:39.140
for fate has...

07:39.340 --> 07:42.440
vouchsafed your reward.

07:42.540 --> 07:45.341
Though the road may wind,

07:45.541 --> 07:48.042
and yea, your hearts grow weary,

07:48.142 --> 07:50.942
still shall ye follow them,

07:51.042 --> 07:55.943
even unto your salvation.

08:07.046 --> 08:10.947
No, the treasure's still
there, boys, believe me.

08:10.947 --> 08:13.247
But how did he know about the treasure?

08:13.447 --> 08:17.348
I don't know, Delmar. The blind
are reputed to have sensitivities
reputedly possess sensitivities

08:17.448 --> 08:19.249
compensating for their lack of sight,

08:19.449 --> 08:22.149
even to the point of developing
paranormal psychic powers.

08:22.249 --> 08:25.750
Clearly, seeing into the future
would fall neatly into that category.

08:25.950 --> 08:29.951
It's not so surprising then that an
organism deprived of its earthly vision...

08:29.951 --> 08:32.952
He said we wouldn't get it. We
wouldn't get the treasure we seek,

08:33.052 --> 08:34.751
on account of our obstacles.

08:34.852 --> 08:37.653
What the hell does he know?
He's an ignorant old man.

08:37.753 --> 08:40.554
Jesus, Pete. I told you I'd buried it myself.

08:40.654 --> 08:42.654
If your cousin still has
this here horse farm

08:42.854 --> 08:46.155
a forge and some shoeing impedimenta
to restore our liberty of movement...

08:47.555 --> 08:49.256
Hold it right there!

08:49.356 --> 08:53.156
You men from the bank?

08:53.156 --> 08:54.657
You Wash's boy?

08:54.857 --> 08:58.558
Yes, sir. And Daddy told me
I'm to shoot whoever's from the bank!

08:58.658 --> 09:01.158
Well, we ain't from the bank, young fella.

09:01.258 --> 09:04.759
Yes, sir. I'm supposed to shoot folks
servin' papers!

09:04.759 --> 09:08.360
- We ain't got no papers, neither.
- I nicked the census man.

09:08.560 --> 09:10.760
Now, there's a good boy.

09:10.860 --> 09:12.961
Is... is your daddy about?

09:24.864 --> 09:26.564
Hello, Pete.

09:26.764 --> 09:28.764
Who are your friends?

09:28.965 --> 09:31.765
Pleased to make your
acquaintance, Mr. Hogwallop.

09:31.965 --> 09:37.066
- My name's Ulysses Everett McGill...
- And I'm Delmar O'Donnel.

09:36.866 --> 09:38.667
How you been, Wash?

09:38.967 --> 09:41.867
Been what, 12, 13 years?

09:44.468 --> 09:46.568
Yeah...

09:46.769 --> 09:50.369
I expect you want them chains knocked off.

09:50.469 --> 09:53.270
They foreclosed on Cousin Vester.

09:53.270 --> 09:56.171
He hanged hisself a year come May.

09:56.271 --> 09:58.071
And Uncle Ratliff?

09:58.271 --> 10:00.472
The anthrax took most of his cows.

10:00.672 --> 10:02.272
The rest don't milk.

10:02.572 --> 10:05.373
He lost a boy to mumps.

10:05.373 --> 10:09.174
Where's Cora, Cousin Wash?

10:11.674 --> 10:15.675
Couldn't say.

10:15.575 --> 10:21.877
Mrs. Hogwallop up and R-U-N-N-O-F-T.

10:21.776 --> 10:24.877
She must have been lookin' for answers.

10:25.077 --> 10:28.278
Possibly. Good riddance,
as far as I'm concerned.

10:28.378 --> 10:31.279
I do miss her cooking, though.

10:31.379 --> 10:35.280
- This stew's awful good.
- You think so?

10:35.380 --> 10:38.080
I slaughtered this horse last Tuesday.

10:38.080 --> 10:42.681
I'm afraid she's startin' to turn.

10:45.882 --> 10:48.683
{y:i} You are my sunshine

10:48.783 --> 10:51.683
{y:i} My only sunshine

10:51.783 --> 10:53.484
{y:i} You make me happy

10:53.784 --> 10:56.084
{y:i} When skies are grey

10:56.284 --> 10:58.785
{y:i} You'll never know, dear

10:58.785 --> 11:01.385
{y:i} How much I love you

11:01.485 --> 11:06.287
{y:i} Please don't take
{y:i} my sunshine away

11:06.287 --> 11:11.388
Well, that winds up tonight's: Pass The
Biscuits, Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour.

11:11.388 --> 11:12.788
This is Pappy O'Daniel,

11:12.888 --> 11:15.789
hopin' you folks have been
enjoyin' that old-timey music.

11:15.889 --> 11:17.789
And remember:

11:17.989 --> 11:21.490
When you're fryin' up some flapjacks,
or baking a mess of biscuits,

11:21.590 --> 11:23.390
use cool, clear water,

11:23.490 --> 11:27.691
and good, pure, Pappy O'Daniel flour.

11:27.791 --> 11:32.993
Well, guess I'll be turnin' in.
Say, uh, Cousin Wash,

11:32.993 --> 11:35.193
I suppose it'd be the acme of foolishness

11:35.393 --> 11:37.194
to enquire if you had a hairnet?

11:37.394 --> 11:40.094
I got a bunch in yond bureau.

11:40.194 --> 11:42.695
Mrs. Hogwallop's, as a matter of fact.

11:42.795 --> 11:47.296
Help yourself. I won't be needing them.

11:47.396 --> 11:48.996
{y:i} You are my sunshine

11:49.096 --> 11:52.497
{y:i} My only sunshine

11:52.597 --> 11:54.998
{y:i} You make me happy

11:55.098 --> 11:56.598
{y:i} When skies are grey...

11:58.698 --> 11:59.899
- All right, boys!

12:00.199 --> 12:01.999
How's my hair?

12:02.099 --> 12:06.500
It's the authorities!
We got you surrounded.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.501
Damn, we're in a tight spot.

12:08.701 --> 12:11.601
Just come on out and grab at air!

12:11.701 --> 12:14.202
And don't try nothin' fancy.

12:14.302 --> 12:16.803
Your situation is pretty nigh hopeless.

12:16.903 --> 12:20.603
- Damn! We're in a tight spot!
- What in the Sam Hill...?

12:20.803 --> 12:22.504
Pete's cousin turned us in for the bounty.

12:22.704 --> 12:23.804
What the hell you sayin'?!

12:24.004 --> 12:25.705
Wash is kin!

12:25.905 --> 12:27.005
Sorry, Pete!

12:27.305 --> 12:30.906
I know we're kin,
but they got this depression on.

12:30.906 --> 12:32.606
I got to do for me and mine.

12:32.806 --> 12:37.107
I'm gonna kill you!
Judas Iscariot Hogwallop!

12:37.207 --> 12:41.508
You miserable, horse-eatin' son of a bitch!

12:41.508 --> 12:43.209
Damn! We're in a tight spot.

12:43.409 --> 12:45.009
Damn his eyes!

12:45.109 --> 12:48.910
Pa always said, "Never trust a Hogwallop".

12:49.010 --> 12:51.510
Come and get us, coppers!

12:53.011 --> 12:56.512
You boys ain't leavin' us no
choice but to smoke you out.

12:56.612 --> 12:58.312
Damn! We're in a tight spot.

12:58.412 --> 12:59.412
Light her up!

12:59.712 --> 13:03.013
Hold on, boys!
Ain't you ever heard of negotiating?

13:03.113 --> 13:05.514
Maybe we can talk this thing out.
I hate fire.

13:05.514 --> 13:08.314
You lousy, low-down,
yellow-bellied skunks!

13:08.314 --> 13:10.315
Pete, we gotta speak
with one voice here.

13:10.415 --> 13:13.916
Careful with that fire, boys!

13:14.516 --> 13:16.416
Light the loft, son.

13:16.516 --> 13:18.817
Aah! I hate fire!

13:18.917 --> 13:23.118
Gapped-toothed, carpetbaggin',
motherless spawn of hell!

13:23.218 --> 13:25.918
Step back. Damn it. Look out.

13:26.118 --> 13:27.819
Holy Saint Christopher!

13:27.919 --> 13:30.419
Get away from that vehicle, champ.
She's lickin' fire.

13:31.920 --> 13:36.021
Take cover, boys! That ain't popcorn!

13:45.323 --> 13:48.223
Scatter, boys!

13:49.224 --> 13:52.124
God damn it!

13:54.925 --> 13:56.225
Get in, boys!

13:56.425 --> 13:58.826
I'm gonna R-U-N-N-O-F-T!

13:58.926 --> 14:02.727
Come on, boys! Come on! Come on!

14:02.827 --> 14:06.928
What are you doing here? You ought
to be in bed, clump snatcher.

14:07.028 --> 14:10.028
You ain't the boss of me!

14:16.030 --> 14:19.730
You candy-butted, car-thievin' so-and-sos!

14:19.930 --> 14:21.931
I curse your names!

14:22.131 --> 14:24.832
Go back home and mind your pa!

14:28.332 --> 14:31.833
What's the damn problem?

14:32.433 --> 14:35.934
I can get the part from Bristol.
It'll take two weeks. Here's your pomade.

14:36.034 --> 14:38.835
Two weeks?
That don't do me no good.

14:39.035 --> 14:41.535
Nearest Ford auto man's in Bristol.

14:41.535 --> 14:44.836
Hold on. I don't want this pomade,
I want Dapper Dan.

14:45.036 --> 14:47.937
I don't carry Dapper Dan.
I carry Fop.

14:48.037 --> 14:51.438
Well, I don't want Fop. Goddamn it!
I'm a Dapper Dan man!

14:51.538 --> 14:54.138
Watch your language, young fellow,
this is a public market.

14:54.338 --> 14:58.639
Now, if you want Dapper Dan, I can order
it so you'll have it in a couple of weeks.

14:58.739 --> 15:02.240
Ain't this a geographical oddity!
Two weeks from everywhere.

15:02.440 --> 15:04.341
Forget it.

15:04.441 --> 15:08.241
Just a dozen hairnets.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.942
Well, didn't look like a one-horse town,

15:11.042 --> 15:13.443
but try finding a decent hair jelly.

15:13.543 --> 15:17.744
- Gopher, Everett?
- And no transmission belt for two weeks.

15:17.744 --> 15:20.444
Huh? They dam that river on the 21st.

15:20.544 --> 15:22.945
- Today is the 17th.
- Don't I know it.

15:23.145 --> 15:25.745
We got but four days to get to that treasure.

15:25.845 --> 15:28.646
After that, it'll be at the bottom of a lake.

15:28.746 --> 15:30.647
We ain't gonna make it walkin'.

15:30.847 --> 15:32.847
- That's right...
- Gopher, Everett?

15:33.047 --> 15:35.348
But the old tactician's got a plan.

15:35.448 --> 15:39.348
For the transportation, that is. I don't
know how I'll keep my coiffure in order.

15:39.449 --> 15:42.549
How's this a plan?
How we gonna get a car?

15:42.549 --> 15:47.050
Sell that. I figure you can only have
painful association for Wash.

15:47.150 --> 15:51.651
"To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop,

15:51.751 --> 15:53.152
from his lovin' Cora."

15:53.352 --> 15:58.753
- "Amor fidel... lis."
- It was in his bureau,

15:58.753 --> 16:02.054
I reckon it'll fetch us enough
cash for a good auto voiture

16:02.054 --> 16:03.854
and a little leftover besides.

16:04.054 --> 16:06.455
Whoo! You got light fingers, Everett.

16:06.655 --> 16:10.356
- Gopher?
- You miserable little snake.

16:10.456 --> 16:12.256
You stole from my kin!

16:12.356 --> 16:14.957
Who was fixin' to betray us.

16:15.057 --> 16:17.057
You didn't know that at the time.

16:17.257 --> 16:19.258
So I borrowed it till I did know.

16:19.358 --> 16:21.358
That don't make no sense!

16:21.458 --> 16:24.359
It's a fool who looks for logic
in the chambers of the human heart.

16:24.459 --> 16:28.960
Now... What the hell is that singing?

16:30.160 --> 16:35.761
Appears to be some kind
of a... congregation.

16:35.861 --> 16:39.462
Care for some gopher?

16:41.062 --> 16:42.863
No, thank you, Delmar.

16:42.963 --> 16:45.964
A third of a gopher'd
only arouse my appetite

16:46.064 --> 16:48.364
without beddin' her back down.

16:48.464 --> 16:50.765
Oh, you can have the whole thing.

16:50.865 --> 16:53.765
Me and Pete already had one.

16:53.965 --> 17:02.767
We ran across a whole...
gopher... village.

17:05.167 --> 17:08.669
{y:i} O brothers, let's go down

17:08.769 --> 17:12.470
{y:i} Let's go down, come on down

17:12.569 --> 17:15.970
{y:i} Come on, brothers, let's go down

17:16.069 --> 17:20.271
{y:i} Down in the river to pray

17:20.271 --> 17:24.071
{y:i} As I went down
{y:i} in the river to pray

17:24.071 --> 17:26.973
{y:i} Studyin' about that good old way

17:27.173 --> 17:30.574
{y:i} And who shall wear
{y:i} the starry crown

17:30.574 --> 17:34.975
{y:i} Good Lord, show me the way

17:35.075 --> 17:38.676
{y:i} O fathers, let's go down

17:38.676 --> 17:42.176
{y:i} Let's go down, come on down

17:42.276 --> 17:45.577
{y:i} O fathers, let's go down

17:45.777 --> 17:49.978
{y:i} Down in the river to pray

17:50.078 --> 17:53.979
{y:i} As I went down
{y:i} in the river to pray

17:53.979 --> 17:57.080
{y:i} Studying about that good old way

17:57.280 --> 18:00.581
{y:i} And who shall wear
{y:i} the robe and crown

18:00.681 --> 18:05.382
{y:i} Good lord, show me the way

18:05.382 --> 18:08.782
{y:i} O mothers, let's go down

18:08.782 --> 18:12.083
{y:i} Come on down,
{y:i} don't you wanna go down?

18:12.283 --> 18:15.984
{y:i} Come on, mothers,
{y:i} let's go down...

18:15.984 --> 18:19.085
Well, I guess hard times flush the chumps.

18:19.285 --> 18:21.385
Everybody's lookin' for answers.

18:24.986 --> 18:26.686
Where the hell's he going?

18:26.886 --> 18:30.787
The Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.

18:30.887 --> 18:34.788
{y:i} Good Lord, show me the way

18:34.888 --> 18:39.289
{y:i} O sinners, let's go down...

18:39.389 --> 18:41.690
Well, I'll be a son of a bitch.

18:41.890 --> 18:43.790
Delmar's been saved.

18:43.990 --> 18:46.891
Well, that's it, boys. I been redeemed.

18:47.091 --> 18:51.292
The preacher done washed away
all my sins and transgressions.

18:51.292 --> 18:54.193
It's the straight and narrow
from here on out.

18:54.293 --> 18:56.793
And heaven everlasting's my reward.

18:56.993 --> 19:00.194
Delmar, what are you on about?
We got bigger fish to fry.

19:00.194 --> 19:03.195
The preacher said
all my sins is washed away,

19:03.395 --> 19:06.395
including that Piggly Wiggly
I knocked over in Yazoo.

19:06.495 --> 19:08.496
I thought you said you were
innocent of those charges?

19:08.696 --> 19:10.896
Well, I was lying.

19:11.096 --> 19:14.797
And the preacher said that
that sin's been washed away, too.

19:14.897 --> 19:18.198
Neither God nor man's
got nothin' on me now.

19:18.298 --> 19:23.199
Come on in, boys. The water is fine.

19:28.700 --> 19:31.501
Come on, boy. There, boy. Good doggy.

19:33.902 --> 19:37.703
All right, boys, we got the scent.

19:40.003 --> 19:43.704
- The preacher said it absolved us.
- For Him, not for the law.

19:43.904 --> 19:46.605
I'm surprised. I gave you credit
for more brains than Delmar.

19:46.605 --> 19:50.705
- But there were witnesses seen us redeemed.
- That's not the issue, Delmar.

19:50.805 --> 19:54.106
Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the
state of Mississippi's a little more hard-nosed.

19:54.106 --> 19:57.507
You shoulda joined us, Everett.
It couldn'a hurt none.

19:57.707 --> 20:01.108
Hell, at least it woulda washed away
the stink of that pomade.

20:01.208 --> 20:04.809
Joining you fools in a ridiculous
superstition? Thank you, anyway.

20:04.909 --> 20:10.210
And I like the smell of my hair treatment,
the pleasin' odour's half the point.

20:10.210 --> 20:12.210
Baptism.

20:12.310 --> 20:14.611
You two are dumber
than a bag of hammers.

20:14.811 --> 20:16.611
Well, I guess you're just my cross to bear.

20:16.911 --> 20:21.813
Pull over, Everett. Let's give
that coloured boy a lift.

20:27.314 --> 20:29.614
You folks going past Tishomingo?

20:29.714 --> 20:32.615
Sure, hop in.

20:39.216 --> 20:41.617
How you doin', son? Name's Everett.

20:41.717 --> 20:45.118
These two soggy sons of bitches
are Pete and Delmar.

20:45.118 --> 20:48.919
Keep your fingers away from Pete's
mouth, he ain't eaten for 13 years,

20:49.119 --> 20:51.419
'cept prison food, gopher,
and a little greasy horse.

20:51.519 --> 20:55.520
Thanks for the lift, sir.
My name's Tommy. Tommy Johnson.

20:55.520 --> 20:57.421
How you doin', Tommy?

20:57.521 --> 21:00.621
Say, I haven't seen a house
out here for miles.

21:00.721 --> 21:03.222
What are you doing out
in the middle of nowhere?

21:03.422 --> 21:06.123
Well I had to be at that there
crossroads last midnight.

21:06.123 --> 21:08.023
Sell my soul to the Devil.

21:08.323 --> 21:10.824
Ain't it a small world, spiritually speakin'?

21:10.824 --> 21:15.025
Pete and Delmar have just been baptized and saved.
I guess I'm the only one that remains unaffiliated.

21:15.125 --> 21:17.325
This ain't no laughin' matter, Everett.

21:17.425 --> 21:19.226
What'd the Devil give you for your soul, Tommy?

21:19.426 --> 21:22.826
Well, he taught me to play
this here guitar real good.

21:22.826 --> 21:27.127
Oh, son, for that you traded
your everlasting soul?

21:27.227 --> 21:28.728
Well, I wasn't usin' it.

21:28.928 --> 21:33.029
I've always wondered,
what's the Devil look like?

21:33.029 --> 21:36.529
Well, of course there are all manner
of lesser imps and demons, Pete,

21:36.629 --> 21:40.330
but the great Satan himself is red
and scaly with a bifurcated tail,

21:40.430 --> 21:43.931
- and carries a hayfork.
- Oh, no. No, sir.

21:43.931 --> 21:47.332
He's white. As white as you folks.

21:47.532 --> 21:50.333
With empty eyes and a big, hollow voice.

21:50.533 --> 21:54.233
He loves travel around with
a mean old hound, that's right.

21:54.233 --> 21:56.234
He told you to go to Tishomingo?

21:56.334 --> 21:59.235
Well, no, sir.
Why, that was my idea.

21:59.335 --> 22:01.235
I heard there's a man down there,

22:01.335 --> 22:03.736
he pays folks money to sing into his can.

22:03.836 --> 22:07.737
They say he pays extra
if'n you play real good.

22:07.737 --> 22:09.637
Tishomingo, huh?

22:09.737 --> 22:11.337
How much he pay?

22:27.041 --> 22:31.742
All right, boys, follow my lead.

22:35.443 --> 22:37.843
Hello?

22:38.043 --> 22:42.644
- Who's the honcho around here?
- I am. Who are you?

22:42.644 --> 22:47.145
Well, sir, I'm Jordan Rivers, and
these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys,

22:47.145 --> 22:49.146
out of Cottonillia, Mississippi.

22:49.246 --> 22:51.646
Songs of salvation to salve the soul.

22:51.847 --> 22:55.647
Uh, we hear that you pay good
money to sing into a can.

22:55.747 --> 22:59.048
Well, that all depends.
You boys do Negro songs?

22:59.048 --> 23:03.949
Um... Well, uh, sir, we are Negroes.

23:03.949 --> 23:07.950
All except for our accomp... accomp...
the fella that plays the guitar.

23:08.050 --> 23:10.251
Yeah, well, I don't record Negro songs.

23:10.451 --> 23:13.852
No, I'm lookin' for
some old-timey material.

23:13.752 --> 23:15.952
You see, people can't seem
to get enough of it

23:16.052 --> 23:19.553
since we started broadcasting it
on the Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour,

23:19.653 --> 23:21.953
so thank you for stopping by...

23:22.053 --> 23:26.955
Sir, the Soggy Bottom Boys have been
steeped in old-timey material.

23:26.854 --> 23:29.555
- Heck, we're silly with it, ain't we, boys?
- That's right.

23:29.755 --> 23:31.756
That's right. We ain't really Negroes.

23:31.956 --> 23:34.056
Except for our accompanist.

23:36.457 --> 23:40.758
{y:i} I am a man

23:40.858 --> 23:43.658
{y:i} Of constant sorrow

23:43.658 --> 23:49.760
{y:i} I've seen trouble all my days

23:49.760 --> 23:54.161
{y:i} I bid farewell

23:54.161 --> 23:56.761
{y:i} To old Kentucky

23:56.861 --> 23:59.262
{y:i} The place where I

23:59.362 --> 24:02.062
{y:i} Was born and raised

24:02.062 --> 24:04.863
{y:i} The place where he

24:05.063 --> 24:08.464
{y:i} Was born and raised

24:08.564 --> 24:12.965
{y:i} For six long years

24:12.965 --> 24:15.566
{y:i} I've been in trouble

24:15.666 --> 24:18.366
{y:i} No pleasure here

24:18.466 --> 24:21.767
{y:i} On Earth I found

24:21.967 --> 24:26.168
{y:i} For in this world

24:26.168 --> 24:28.368
{y:i} I'm bound to ramble

24:28.468 --> 24:31.469
{y:i} I have no friends

24:31.669 --> 24:34.270
{y:i} To help me now

24:34.470 --> 24:36.970
{y:i} He has no friends

24:37.070 --> 24:40.671
{y:i} To help him now

24:40.671 --> 24:45.172
{y:i} Maybe your friends think

24:45.172 --> 24:47.773
{y:i} I'm just a stranger

24:47.873 --> 24:50.373
{y:i} My face you never

24:50.473 --> 24:51.774
{y:i} Will see no more

24:54.074 --> 24:58.975
{y:i} But there is one promise

24:58.975 --> 25:00.976
{y:i} That is given

25:01.176 --> 25:03.676
{y:i} I'll meet you on

25:03.876 --> 25:06.477
{y:i} God's golden shore

25:06.577 --> 25:09.278
{y:i} He'll meet you on

25:09.378 --> 25:14.379
{y:i} God's golden shore

25:15.379 --> 25:18.980
Whoo! Hot damn, son! I do believe
you did sell your soul to the Devil!

25:19.080 --> 25:20.380
Whoo-ee!

25:20.480 --> 25:24.381
Boy, that was some mighty fine
a-pickin' and a-singin'.

25:24.381 --> 25:25.681
I'll tell you what.

25:25.981 --> 25:28.182
Ahem. You come on in here, you...

25:28.382 --> 25:32.883
you sign these papers here,
I'm gonna give you $10 apiece.

25:32.883 --> 25:39.084
Uh, OK, sir, but Mert and
uh... Aloysious'll have to sign X's.

25:39.084 --> 25:43.085
- Only four of us can write.
- That'd be fine.

25:43.085 --> 25:45.586
- Ha ha!
- Whoo!

25:45.786 --> 25:49.087
Hey, mister, I don't mean to
be telling tales out of school,

25:49.187 --> 25:52.988
but there's a fella in there'll pay
you $10 if you sing into his can.

25:53.088 --> 25:56.088
I'm not here to make a record,
you dumb cracker.

25:56.288 --> 25:58.089
They broadcast me on the radio.

25:58.289 --> 26:01.189
That's Governor Menelaus,
"Pass the Biscuits, Pappy O'Daniel".

26:01.289 --> 26:05.490
And he'd appreciate it if you ate his
farina and voted him a second term.

26:05.490 --> 26:08.191
- Finest governor we ever had in Mississippi.
- In any state.

26:08.291 --> 26:10.592
Lord, yes, every parish or precinct.
He was making a bigger point.

26:10.692 --> 26:14.492
Ain't you gonna press the flesh, Pappy?
Do some politickin'?

26:14.492 --> 26:16.693
I'll press your flesh,
you dim-witted son'bitch.

26:16.893 --> 26:20.694
Don't tell your Pappy how to court the
electorate. We ain't one-at-a-timin' here.

26:20.794 --> 26:22.494
We're mass communicatin'!

26:22.594 --> 26:25.195
Oh, yes, that's a powerful new force.

26:25.395 --> 26:26.695
Shake a leg, Junior.

26:26.995 --> 26:29.396
Thank God your mammy died givin' birth.

26:29.496 --> 26:31.096
If she'd seen you she'd have died of shame.

26:31.196 --> 26:33.097
Well, hi there! How you doin'?

26:34.997 --> 26:40.598
{y:i} Hard time yearnin'
{y:i} where you go

26:40.598 --> 26:46.200
{y:i} Times is harder
{y:i} than ever been before

26:50.901 --> 26:54.001
{y:i} And the people are driftin'

26:54.101 --> 26:56.702
{y:i} From door to door

26:56.802 --> 26:58.202
{y:i} Can't find no heaven

26:58.302 --> 27:01.703
{y:i} I don't care where they go

27:01.903 --> 27:07.104
{y:i} Mm-hmm, mm-hmm

27:07.204 --> 27:11.705
{y:i} Mm-hm, mm-hmm

27:11.805 --> 27:14.306
{y:i} Say you had money

27:14.306 --> 27:16.807
{y:i} You better be sure

27:16.907 --> 27:18.807
{y:i} These hard times will drive you

27:18.907 --> 27:21.808
{y:i} From door to door

27:21.908 --> 27:24.208
{y:i} Uh-hmm

27:24.308 --> 27:27.109
{y:i} Mm-hmm

27:27.209 --> 27:33.210
{y:i} Uh-hmm, mm-hmm...

27:33.010 --> 27:35.411
Let's bed down here for the night.

27:35.511 --> 27:39.212
Yeah, it stinks in that old barn.

27:39.312 --> 27:40.712
Suits me.

27:40.912 --> 27:46.813
Pretty soon it'll be nothin' but
featherbeds and silk sheets.

27:46.913 --> 27:49.514
{y:i} Mm-hm...

27:49.514 --> 27:51.314
A million dollars.

27:51.615 --> 27:53.515
Million point two.

27:53.715 --> 27:58.416
- 500,000 each.
- 400, Delmar.

27:58.416 --> 28:05.118
Pete, what are you gonna do
with your share of the treasure?

28:05.018 --> 28:07.618
Go out west somewhere.

28:07.718 --> 28:11.319
Open a fine restaurant.

28:11.219 --> 28:14.720
I'm gonna be the maitre d'.

28:14.820 --> 28:17.520
Greet all the swells.

28:17.520 --> 28:20.821
Go to work every day in a bow tie,

28:21.021 --> 28:23.022
tuxedo.

28:23.222 --> 28:26.722
And all the staff say "yes, sir" and...

28:26.822 --> 28:28.123
"no, sir"...

28:28.323 --> 28:31.724
and "in a jiffy, Pete".

28:31.824 --> 28:35.825
And all my meals for free.

28:38.625 --> 28:40.426
What about you, Delmar,

28:40.626 --> 28:43.826
what are you gonna do with
your share of that dough?

28:43.926 --> 28:47.627
I'm gonna visit them
foreclosin' son of a guns

28:47.727 --> 28:51.328
down at the Indianola Savings and Loan.

28:51.328 --> 28:57.429
Slap that money on the barrel head
and buy back the family farm.

28:57.429 --> 29:02.030
You ain't no kind of man
if you ain't got land.

29:02.030 --> 29:03.931
What about you, Everett?

29:04.131 --> 29:07.932
What you have in mind when
you stole it in the first place?

29:07.932 --> 29:14.233
Ahem. I... didn't have no plan.

29:14.233 --> 29:17.134
Well, that hardly sounds like you.

29:17.234 --> 29:20.435
All right, boys! It's the authorities!

29:20.635 --> 29:23.235
Your situation is pretty hopeless!

29:23.235 --> 29:25.636
Damn, they found our car.

29:25.736 --> 29:28.937
We ain't got the time
and nary the inclination

29:29.037 --> 29:31.537
to chat with you boys any further.

29:31.637 --> 29:33.738
Damn, we got to skedaddle.

29:33.938 --> 29:37.839
I left my pomade in the car.
Maybe I can creep up.

29:37.939 --> 29:42.240
Don't be a fool, Everett.
We got to R-U-N-N-O-F-T.

29:42.340 --> 29:44.240
Where's Tommy?

29:44.340 --> 29:49.541
Already lit out, scared out of his wits.

29:50.541 --> 29:53.442
Let's go!

29:53.542 --> 29:55.543
Well, hell, it ain't square one.

29:55.643 --> 29:59.744
Ain't no one gonna pick up three
filthy unshaved hitchhikers.

29:59.744 --> 30:03.744
And one of them a know-it-all
who can't keep his trap shut.

30:03.844 --> 30:08.045
Pete, the personal rancour reflected in that
remark I don't intend to dignify with comment.

30:08.145 --> 30:12.346
But I would like to address your general
attitude of hopeless negativism.

30:12.446 --> 30:15.247
Consider the lilies of the goddam field.

30:15.347 --> 30:18.248
Or, hell, look at Delmar here
as your paradigm of hope.

30:18.448 --> 30:20.048
Yeah. Look at me.

30:20.148 --> 30:24.149
You may call it an unreasoning
optimism, you may call it obtuse,

30:24.149 --> 30:27.350
but the plain and simple fact
is that we got close to...

30:27.550 --> 30:30.150
three days before they...

30:34.651 --> 30:38.852
...dam that river.

30:59.857 --> 31:03.758
Is this the road to Itta Bena?

31:03.758 --> 31:06.559
Uh... Itta Bena?

31:06.659 --> 31:10.960
Itta Bena?
If you stay on this here road.

31:11.060 --> 31:14.360
That ain't right,
I was thinking of, uh...

31:14.460 --> 31:16.761
- Take this road.
- Nah, that ain't right.

31:16.961 --> 31:19.062
Seems to me there's a road...

31:19.262 --> 31:21.962
Cow road that used to lead all the way...

31:22.162 --> 31:25.463
Well, most of the way...
Er, that ain't right, either.

31:25.463 --> 31:32.365
- Hop in while you give it a think.
- Right. Delmar.

31:39.166 --> 31:41.967
Any of you boys know your
way around a Walther PPK?

31:42.067 --> 31:47.468
Well, see, that's where we can't help ya.
I don't believe it's in Mississippi.

31:47.868 --> 31:51.269
Friend, some of your folding
money has come unstowed.

31:51.269 --> 31:54.069
Just stuff it down that
sack, will you?

31:54.170 --> 31:56.270
You boys aren't bad men, I take it?

31:56.370 --> 31:58.570
Well, it's funny you should ask.

31:58.771 --> 32:02.871
I was bad till yesterday, but me
and Pete here have been saved.

32:02.871 --> 32:05.672
I'm Delmar, and that there is Everett.

32:05.872 --> 32:09.673
George Nelson. It's a pleasure.

32:09.673 --> 32:13.874
Grab the tiller, will you, buddy?

32:17.775 --> 32:19.775
Hand me that chopper.

32:19.975 --> 32:23.076
Say, what line of work you in, George?

32:23.176 --> 32:24.976
Ha ha ha ha!

32:25.077 --> 32:26.477
Come and get me, coppers!

32:26.577 --> 32:30.878
You flatfooted, lame-brained,
soft-ass sons of bitches!

32:30.878 --> 32:35.979
Ah ha ha ha ha! No one can catch me!
I'm George Nelson!

32:35.979 --> 32:40.280
I'm bigger than any John,
live or limp!

32:40.280 --> 32:45.181
I'm ten an' a half feet tall
and ain't yet fully grown!

32:46.081 --> 32:52.083
Cows. I hate cows worse than coppers!

32:52.683 --> 32:54.883
Oh, George... Not the livestock.

32:55.083 --> 33:00.385
Come on, you miserable salaried
sons of bitches! Come and get me!

33:15.288 --> 33:18.089
Come on, boys, we're going for the record.

33:18.089 --> 33:19.589
Three banks in two hours!

33:26.791 --> 33:30.091
OK, folks, hold the applause
and drop your drawers!

33:30.091 --> 33:35.793
I'm George Nelson, and I'm here
to sack the city Itta Bena!

33:35.592 --> 33:37.893
He's a live wire, though, ain't he?

33:37.993 --> 33:41.094
All the money in a bag.
What are you lookin' at, grandpa?

33:41.094 --> 33:43.794
Pardon me, George, you got a
plan for getting outta here?

33:43.894 --> 33:45.495
Sure, boys.

33:45.695 --> 33:47.795
Here's my plan. Ha ha ha ha!

33:47.995 --> 33:50.596
They ain't never seen
ordnance like this!

33:50.696 --> 33:52.496
Thank you, folks.

33:52.796 --> 33:57.798
And remember, Jesus saves,
but George Nelson withdraws!

33:57.798 --> 33:59.698
Go fix the auto voiture, Pete.

33:59.898 --> 34:02.899
That's Babyface Nelson.

34:02.999 --> 34:05.899
Who said that?

34:06.099 --> 34:09.900
What ignorant, low-down, slanderisin'

34:10.000 --> 34:13.201
son of a bitch said that?!

34:13.301 --> 34:17.802
My name is George Nelson, get me?!

34:17.902 --> 34:21.103
She didn't mean nothin' by it, George.

34:21.203 --> 34:24.304
George Nelson! Not Babyface!

34:24.404 --> 34:28.504
You remember!
And you tell your friends!

34:28.605 --> 34:31.005
I'm George Nelson.

34:31.105 --> 34:34.406
Born to raise hell.

34:50.509 --> 34:53.710
Well, that was some fun,
now, wasn't it, George?

34:53.810 --> 34:55.011
Yeah.

34:55.110 --> 34:57.911
Almost makes me wish
I hadn'ta been saved.

34:58.111 --> 34:59.412
Jacking up banks.

34:59.512 --> 35:03.012
I can see how a fella'd derive
a whole lot of pleasure

35:03.212 --> 35:05.113
and satisfaction out of it.

35:05.213 --> 35:09.414
- It's OK.
- Hoo, dawgies!

35:12.414 --> 35:15.415
Well...

35:15.415 --> 35:19.216
I'm takin' off.

35:19.416 --> 35:27.718
You boys might as well keep my...
share of the riches.

35:27.518 --> 35:32.519
Well, where
are you going, George?

35:32.319 --> 35:35.420
I don't know. Who cares?

35:38.020 --> 35:41.021
Now, what do you suppose
is eatin' George?

35:41.121 --> 35:45.822
Well, they say that with
the thrill-seeking personality,

35:45.822 --> 35:47.522
what goes up must come down.

35:47.722 --> 35:50.923
Top of the world one minute,
haunted by megrims the next.

35:51.023 --> 35:55.624
Yes, sir, it's as if our old
friend George is a alley cat

35:55.724 --> 35:58.725
and his own damn humours
are swingin' him by the tail.

35:58.825 --> 36:02.526
I wouldn't worry, Delmar.
He'll be back on top again.

36:02.626 --> 36:08.327
I don't think we've seen
the last of George Nelson.

36:25.231 --> 36:28.332
Don't be saps for Pappy.

36:28.432 --> 36:30.732
Homer Stokes for governor.

36:30.932 --> 36:35.533
Let's sweep this state clean.
Vote for Stokes, brother.

36:35.533 --> 36:39.134
{y:i} ...meet with the darkness
{y:i} and strive

36:39.234 --> 36:44.135
{y:i} The sunny side you also may view

36:44.035 --> 36:46.536
{y:i} Keep on the sunny side

36:46.636 --> 36:48.536
{y:i} Always on the sunny side

36:48.736 --> 36:51.937
Aw, shh shh. Hang on!
I'm gonna slap one on here.

36:52.137 --> 36:54.438
Folks, here's my cousin Ezra's niece,

36:54.638 --> 36:56.438
Eudora from out of Greenwood,

36:56.638 --> 36:59.739
doin' a little number
with her cousin Tom-Tom,

36:59.839 --> 37:04.740
which I predict you
gonna enjoy thoroughly.

37:06.940 --> 37:11.241
Now, what can I do you for,
Mr. French?

37:11.341 --> 37:14.542
How can I lay a hold
of them Soggy Bottom Boys?

37:14.542 --> 37:18.043
Soggy Bottom.
I don't precisely recollect them.

37:18.143 --> 37:21.644
They cut a record a few days ago,
an old-timey harmony thing,

37:21.744 --> 37:23.744
with a guitar accomp... accomp...

37:23.944 --> 37:27.045
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I remember them.

37:27.145 --> 37:28.945
Coloured fellas, I believe.

37:29.145 --> 37:31.646
Yes, sir, they a fine bunch of boys.

37:31.746 --> 37:35.147
They sang into yonder can, then skedaddled.

37:35.247 --> 37:38.948
Well, that record is just
goin' through the goddam roof.

37:39.048 --> 37:41.448
- They playin' it far away as Mobile.
- No.

37:41.548 --> 37:43.549
Whole damn state's goin' apey.

37:43.649 --> 37:46.949
Well, it was a powerful air.

37:47.050 --> 37:50.550
Hot damn, we gotta find them boys
and sign 'em to a big fat contract.

37:50.650 --> 37:54.551
Hell's bells, Mr. Lund, if we don't,
the goddam competition will.

37:54.551 --> 37:57.752
Oh, mercy, yes, we got
to beat that competition.

37:57.952 --> 37:59.452
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

37:59.652 --> 38:01.353
{y:i} Fly away

38:01.453 --> 38:06.154
{y:i} Like a bird,
{y:i} from these prison walls I'll fly

38:06.254 --> 38:10.855
{y:i} I'll fly away, fly away

38:10.955 --> 38:15.856
{y:i} I'll fly away, fly away, o glory

38:15.956 --> 38:18.657
{y:i} I'll fly away, fly away

38:18.757 --> 38:20.357
{y:i} In the mornin'

38:20.557 --> 38:25.058
{y:i} When I die,
{y:i} hallelujah by and by

38:25.158 --> 38:29.859
{y:i} I'll fly away, fly away

38:29.959 --> 38:34.460
{y:i} Just a few more weary days
{y:i} and then

38:34.460 --> 38:39.061
{y:i} I'll fly away, fly away

38:39.161 --> 38:40.862
{y:i} To a land where joys

38:41.062 --> 38:43.562
Woo hoo, whoo!
{y:i} will never end...

38:43.662 --> 38:46.263
{y:i} I'll fly away, fly away...

38:48.263 --> 38:53.165
{y:i} I'll fly away, fly away, o glory

38:53.165 --> 38:56.765
{y:i} I'll fly away, fly away

38:56.965 --> 38:57.966
{y:i} In the mornin'

38:58.166 --> 39:02.867
{y:i} When I die hallelujah by and by

39:02.967 --> 39:07.768
{y:i} I'll fly away, fly away

39:07.768 --> 39:12.369
{y:i} When the shadows
{y:i} of this life have gone

39:12.369 --> 39:17.170
{y:i} I'll fly away, fly away

39:17.270 --> 39:21.971
{y:i} Like a bird from
{y:i} these prison walls I'll fly

39:22.071 --> 39:23.471
{y:i} I'll fly away, fly away...

39:23.671 --> 39:27.772
Delmar! Over here!

39:34.874 --> 39:38.575
Do you have the Soggy Bottom Boys
performing "Man of Constant Sorrow"?

39:38.575 --> 39:41.275
No, ma'am. We got a new
shipment in yesterday.

39:41.275 --> 39:44.776
Sorry, but we just can't
keep 'em on our shelves.

39:44.776 --> 39:49.577
{y:i} I'll fly away, fly away, o glory

39:49.677 --> 39:52.678
{y:i} I'll fly away, fly away

39:52.778 --> 39:54.578
{y:i} In the mornin'

39:54.678 --> 39:59.380
{y:i} When I die, hallelujah by and by

39:59.480 --> 40:03.680
{y:i} I'll fly away, fly away

40:03.781 --> 40:08.582
{y:i} Just a few more weary days
{y:i} and then

40:08.682 --> 40:12.983
{y:i} I'll fly away, fly away

40:13.083 --> 40:17.884
{y:i} To a land where joys
{y:i} will never end

40:17.984 --> 40:22.585
{y:i} I'll fly away, fly away

40:22.685 --> 40:27.086
{y:i} I'll fly away, fly away, o glory

40:27.186 --> 40:30.487
{y:i} I'll fly away, fly away

40:30.587 --> 40:32.387
How are you?
{y:i} In the mornin'

40:32.587 --> 40:36.488
Delmar, come on. Go.
{y:i} When I die, hallelujah by and by

40:36.488 --> 40:41.089
{y:i} I'll fly away, fly away

40:41.089 --> 40:44.090
{y:i} I'll fly away, fly away

40:44.290 --> 40:50.291
{y:i} In the mornin'

40:56.993 --> 41:00.593
{y:i} Go to sleep, you little baby

41:00.593 --> 41:01.794
Shut up, Delmar.

41:06.095 --> 41:10.596
Ohh!

41:10.596 --> 41:15.197
Pull over! Pull over!

41:20.398 --> 41:23.999
Guess old Pete's got the itch.

41:25.199 --> 41:29.300
{y:i} Go to sleep, you little baby

41:29.400 --> 41:33.101
{y:i} Go to sleep, you little baby

41:33.101 --> 41:36.402
{y:i} Your mama's gone away,
{y:i} and your daddy's gonna stay

41:36.602 --> 41:42.903
{y:i} Didn't leave nobody but the baby

41:42.803 --> 41:47.204
- Howdy do, ladies? Name of Pete.
{y:i} Go to sleep, you little baby

41:47.304 --> 41:50.705
{y:i} Go to sleep, you little baby

41:50.905 --> 41:54.506
{y:i} Everybody's gone
{y:i} in the cotton and the corn

41:54.506 --> 41:59.707
{y:i} Didn't leave nobody
{y:i} but the baby...

41:59.807 --> 42:01.207
You gonna introduce us?

42:01.307 --> 42:05.008
I don't know their names.
I seen 'em first!

42:05.208 --> 42:08.609
{y:i} You're sweet, little baby

42:08.709 --> 42:13.210
{y:i} Honey in the rock,
{y:i} and the sugar don't stop

42:13.310 --> 42:18.111
{y:i} Gonna bring a bottle to the baby

42:18.211 --> 42:23.212
{y:i} Don't you weep, pretty baby

42:23.312 --> 42:26.713
{y:i} Don't you weep, pretty baby

42:26.813 --> 42:30.714
{y:i} She's long gone
{y:i} with her red shoes on

42:30.814 --> 42:36.015
{y:i} Gonna need another
{y:i} lovin' baby...

42:37.915 --> 42:42.216
Ladies, my name is
Ulysses Everett McGill,

42:42.316 --> 42:45.917
and, well, you three ladies
are about the... the prettiest...

42:45.917 --> 42:49.018
{y:i} You and me
{y:i} and the Devil makes three

42:49.118 --> 42:54.419
{y:i} Don't need no other
{y:i} lovin' baby...

42:54.419 --> 42:55.519
Water lilies, uh...

42:55.820 --> 43:00.321
{y:i} - Go to sleep, you little baby...
- Corn liquor.

43:00.421 --> 43:03.721
{y:i} Go to sleep, you little baby

43:03.821 --> 43:07.422
{y:i} You and me
{y:i} and the Devil makes three

43:07.522 --> 43:13.724
{y:i} Don't need no other lovin' baby

43:13.624 --> 43:18.025
{y:i} Go to sleep, you little baby

43:18.125 --> 43:21.525
{y:i} Go to sleep, you little baby

43:21.625 --> 43:25.326
{y:i} Your mama's gone away,
{y:i} and your daddy's gonna stay

43:25.326 --> 43:31.728
{y:i} Didn't leave nobody but the baby

43:31.828 --> 43:35.929
{y:i} Go to sleep, you little baby

43:35.929 --> 43:39.930
{y:i} Go to sleep, you little baby

43:39.930 --> 43:43.530
{y:i} Come lay your bones
{y:i} on the alabaster stones

43:43.730 --> 43:50.932
{y:i} And be my everlovin' baby

44:29.241 --> 44:32.541
Everett.

44:33.142 --> 44:36.742
- Everett.
- My hair!

44:36.942 --> 44:39.943
Look at this.

44:51.946 --> 44:53.646
Pete!

44:53.946 --> 44:56.247
Where the heck are you?!

44:56.347 --> 44:58.147
Pete!

44:58.347 --> 45:02.648
We ain't got time
for hide-and-seek!

45:03.248 --> 45:05.349
We ain't got time for shenanigans!

45:05.549 --> 45:07.649
Sweet Jesus, Everett.

45:07.849 --> 45:11.650
They left his heart!

45:33.255 --> 45:35.956
Delmar, what the heck's got into you?

45:36.056 --> 45:37.556
Can't you see it, Everett?

45:37.756 --> 45:41.157
Them sirens did this to Pete.

45:41.157 --> 45:46.958
They loved him up and turned
him into a... horny toad.

45:50.759 --> 45:52.159
Pete!

45:52.460 --> 45:54.760
Pete! Pete!

45:54.960 --> 45:58.561
Pete! Pete!

45:58.561 --> 46:03.362
Pete! Pete!

46:08.963 --> 46:13.364
Pete, it's me... Delmar.

46:13.464 --> 46:16.765
It's me... Delmar.

46:16.865 --> 46:20.166
- Everett.
- Delmar, what the...?!

46:20.366 --> 46:23.767
What are we gonna do?!

46:32.269 --> 46:33.869
I'm not sure that's Pete.

46:34.069 --> 46:37.270
Of course it's Pete. Look at him.

46:37.370 --> 46:43.471
We got to find some kind of...
wizard can change him back.

46:45.272 --> 46:49.172
I'm just not sure that's Pete.

46:51.073 --> 46:53.873
You can't display a toad in a
fine restaurant like this one.

46:53.974 --> 46:55.574
The good folks'd go off their feed.

46:55.774 --> 46:59.475
Hey. I just don't think it's right
keeping him under wraps,

46:59.475 --> 47:01.075
like we was ashamed of him.

47:01.275 --> 47:03.376
If it is Pete, I am ashamed of him.

47:03.476 --> 47:07.477
The way I see it, he got what he deserved.
Fornicatin' with some whore of Babylon.

47:07.677 --> 47:09.977
These things don't happen
for no reason, Delmar.

47:10.077 --> 47:11.978
It's obviously a judgment
on Pete's character.

47:12.278 --> 47:16.779
Well, the two of us was fixin' to fornicate.

47:16.879 --> 47:19.579
You're going to have to excuse
my rusticated friend,

47:19.579 --> 47:22.780
unaccustomed as he is
to city manners and all.

47:22.880 --> 47:23.880
Hmm?

47:24.080 --> 47:27.081
I guess we'll have ourselves
a couple of steaks

47:27.281 --> 47:29.282
and some, uh, gratinated potatoes,

47:29.382 --> 47:31.982
and wash it down with
your finest bubbly wine.

47:32.182 --> 47:36.483
Oh, I don't suppose you have any
nits or grubs back in the pantry?

47:36.483 --> 47:38.984
Maybe the chef could prepare...

47:39.184 --> 47:42.685
No, just bring us a couple
of leaves of raw cabbage.

47:42.785 --> 47:44.585
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

47:44.685 --> 47:48.886
I don't believe I've seen you boys around
here before. Allow me to introduce myself.

47:48.986 --> 47:52.887
Name of Daniel Teague, known Known in
these precincts as Big Dan Teague,

47:52.987 --> 47:55.688
Or, pressed for time, Big Dan!
Tout court!

47:55.888 --> 48:00.289
How you doing, Big Dan? My name's Ulysses Everett
McGill. This is my associate, Delmar O'Donnel.

48:00.289 --> 48:03.989
I detect, like me, you're
endowed with the gift of gab.

48:03.989 --> 48:07.890
I flatter myself that such is the case.
In my line of work, it's plum necessary.

48:08.090 --> 48:11.391
The one thing you don't want

48:11.491 --> 48:13.892
is air in the conversation.

48:14.092 --> 48:17.292
Once again, we find ourselves in agreement.
What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?

48:17.392 --> 48:19.793
Sales, Mr. McGill, sales!
And what do I sell?

48:19.993 --> 48:21.893
The truth. Every blessed word of it.

48:22.093 --> 48:24.094
From Genesis on down to Revelations.

48:24.294 --> 48:26.895
That's right, the word of God,
which, let me tell you,

48:27.095 --> 48:30.895
there's damn good money in
during these times of woe and want.

48:30.996 --> 48:35.096
People are looking for answers, and Big Dan
sells the only book that's got 'em.

48:35.196 --> 48:39.798
And what do you do, you and
your, uh, tongue-tied friend?

48:39.898 --> 48:41.998
We, uh...

48:42.098 --> 48:43.698
We're adventurers, sir,

48:43.898 --> 48:45.499
currently pursuing a certain opportunity,

48:45.799 --> 48:47.699
but we're open to others as well.

48:47.899 --> 48:50.900
I like your style, young man. So
I'm going to propose you a proposition.

48:50.900 --> 48:55.501
You cover my bill so I won't have to go back upstairs,
get your waitress to wrap your dinner picnic-style

48:55.601 --> 48:58.102
and we shall retire to more private environs,

48:58.202 --> 49:00.802
where I'll tell you of the vast amounts of money

49:01.002 --> 49:02.903
in the service of God Almighty.

49:03.003 --> 49:06.804
Well, why not? If nothing else, I could
use some civilised conversation.

49:06.904 --> 49:09.204
Don't forget your shoe box, friend.

49:09.304 --> 49:12.605
Damn shame!
Goddam campaign is lagging!

49:12.705 --> 49:17.106
We need a shot in the arm. You
hear me, boys? In the goddam arm!

49:17.206 --> 49:21.507
If the election was held tomorrow, that
sumbitch Stokes would win in a walk!

49:21.607 --> 49:24.408
He's the reform candidate, Daddy.

49:24.508 --> 49:27.308
- Yeah?
- People like that reform.

49:27.408 --> 49:29.609
Maybe we should get us some.

49:29.709 --> 49:32.910
I'll reform you, you
soft-headed son of a bitch.

49:33.110 --> 49:35.810
How we gonna run reform
when we're the damn incumbent?!

49:35.810 --> 49:38.911
Is that the best idea you boys
can come up with? Reform?!

49:39.011 --> 49:41.512
Weepin' Jesus on the cross.

49:41.712 --> 49:43.212
That's it!

49:43.312 --> 49:46.013
You may as well start drafting my
concession speech right now.

49:46.213 --> 49:47.713
OK, Pappy.

49:47.813 --> 49:50.313
I'm just making a point,
you stupid son'bitch.

49:50.514 --> 49:53.814
- Give me back that hat! Harry up!
- Pappy's just makin' a point.

49:54.014 --> 49:56.515
Shut up!

50:10.618 --> 50:14.619
Thank you boys for that fricassee.
I'm a man of large appetites.

50:14.719 --> 50:17.720
Even with lunch under my belt,
I was feelin' a mite peckish.

50:17.720 --> 50:18.820
It's our pleasure, Big Dan.

50:19.020 --> 50:22.321
Thank you, as well, for
the conversational hiatus.

50:22.421 --> 50:25.421
I generally refrain from
speech during gustation.

50:25.521 --> 50:28.522
There are those who attempt
both at the same time.

50:28.722 --> 50:30.623
I find it coarse and vulgar.

50:30.723 --> 50:33.823
- Where were we?
- Making money in the Lord's service.

50:34.023 --> 50:37.424
You don't say much friend, but when you do,
it's to the point and I salute you for it.

50:37.524 --> 50:39.325
Yes, Bible sales.

50:39.425 --> 50:43.726
Now, the trade is not a complicated one.
There are but two things to learn.

50:43.726 --> 50:45.326
One: being able to find a wholesaler,

50:45.626 --> 50:47.126
The word of God in bulk, as it were.

50:47.326 --> 50:51.327
Two: how to recognise your customer.
Who are you dealing with?

50:51.327 --> 50:54.328
It's an exercise in psychology, so to speak.

50:54.428 --> 51:02.030
And it is that which I propose
to give you a lesson in right now.

51:02.030 --> 51:05.631
I like to think I'm a pretty astute
student of the human scene too, Big Dan.

51:05.631 --> 51:08.931
No doubt, brother. I figured
as much back at the restaurant.

51:09.031 --> 51:14.233
That's why I invited you all out here
for this advanced tutorial.

51:14.233 --> 51:16.733
What's going on, Big Dan?

51:16.933 --> 51:19.934
It's all about the money, boys!
That's the answer!

51:20.034 --> 51:24.735
Gol... durned... money!

51:24.835 --> 51:25.735
I don't get it, Big Dan.

51:25.835 --> 51:28.936
Raah!

51:28.836 --> 51:32.437
Now, I'll just take your show cards.

51:32.637 --> 51:37.138
Yaah!

51:40.538 --> 51:44.139
And whatever you got in the hole.

51:47.040 --> 51:51.441
What the... there ain't
nothin' but a damn toad.

51:51.541 --> 51:57.442
No, you don't understand.
That's Pete.

51:59.643 --> 52:01.143
Pete.

52:01.243 --> 52:05.144
You know these things give you warts?

52:12.146 --> 52:13.546
End of lesson.

52:16.047 --> 52:18.447
So long, boys. Hee hee hee!

52:18.547 --> 52:20.748
See you in the funny papers.

52:20.948 --> 52:25.149
Y'all seen the end of Big Dan Teague.

52:45.853 --> 52:51.154
Where are they? Talk, you
unreconstructed whelp of a whore!

52:51.154 --> 52:53.055
Where they headed?

52:53.255 --> 52:56.456
- Aah!
- Your screams ain't gonna save your flesh.

52:56.656 --> 52:59.156
- Aah!
- Only your tongue is, boy.

52:59.256 --> 53:01.857
- Where they headed?
- Aah!

53:13.260 --> 53:16.660
Whoa, hound.

53:22.562 --> 53:26.162
Sweet summer rain.

53:27.663 --> 53:31.064
Like God's own mercy.

53:31.164 --> 53:34.064
Your two friends
have abandoned you, Pete.

53:34.264 --> 53:37.465
They don't seem to care about your hide.

53:42.166 --> 53:45.367
OK.

53:48.968 --> 53:52.468
Stairway to heaven, Pete.

53:54.369 --> 53:55.969
We shall all meet by and by.

53:56.169 --> 53:58.770
God damn it!

54:00.670 --> 54:02.271
God forgive me!

54:02.471 --> 54:05.571
Hold.

54:15.274 --> 54:18.974
Believe me, Delmar, he would
have wanted us to press on.

54:19.174 --> 54:23.175
Pete, rest his soul,
was one sour-ass son of a bitch

54:23.275 --> 54:26.376
and not given to acts
of pointless sentimentality.

54:26.376 --> 54:29.377
It just don't seem right, diggin'
up that treasure without him.

54:29.577 --> 54:32.678
Maybe it was for the best
that he was squished.

54:32.778 --> 54:36.178
Why, he... was barely
a sentient being and.

54:36.178 --> 54:39.479
As soon as we get ourselves cleaned up,
get a little smell'um in our hair,

54:39.679 --> 54:42.480
we're going to feel 100%
better about ourselves,

54:42.580 --> 54:45.580
and about... life in general.

54:47.081 --> 54:50.682
Must be near Parchment Farm.

54:50.682 --> 54:52.382
Sorry sons of bitches.

54:52.582 --> 54:56.083
Seems like a year ago
we busted off the farm.

55:04.985 --> 55:06.585
Pete got a brother?

55:06.785 --> 55:10.786
Not that I'm aware.

55:12.086 --> 55:14.187
Heat must be getting to me.

55:22.389 --> 55:26.590
{y:i} Oh, the storm and its fury
{y:i} raged today

55:26.690 --> 55:31.291
{y:i} Crushing hope
{y:i} that we cherished so dear

55:31.291 --> 55:36.492
{y:i} The cloud and storm
{y:i} will in time pass away

55:36.492 --> 55:41.693
{y:i} And the sun again
{y:i} will shine bright and clear

55:41.693 --> 55:44.194
{y:i} Keep on the sunny side

55:44.294 --> 55:46.594
{y:i} Always on the sunny side

55:46.694 --> 55:50.995
{y:i} Keep on the sunny side of life

55:51.095 --> 55:53.196
{y:i} It will help us every day

55:53.296 --> 55:55.496
{y:i} It will brighten all the way

55:55.596 --> 56:00.197
{y:i} If we'll keep on
{y:i} the sunny side of life

56:00.297 --> 56:05.098
{y:i} If we'll keep on
{y:i} the sunny side of life

56:06.799 --> 56:10.600
That was wonderful.
That sure was. Yes.

56:10.700 --> 56:13.700
Now, I know The Sunnysiders
would agree with me

56:13.900 --> 56:16.401
when I say that the great
state of Mississippi

56:16.501 --> 56:20.402
cannot afford four more years
of Pappy O'Daniel!

56:20.502 --> 56:23.303
Four more years of cronyism!

56:23.403 --> 56:26.303
Nepotism! Rascalism!

56:26.303 --> 56:30.104
Of service to the interests!

56:30.304 --> 56:33.405
Now, the choice, she's a clear.

56:33.505 --> 56:37.006
Pappy O'Daniel, slave of the interests.

56:37.206 --> 56:41.407
Homer Stokes, servant of the
little man. Right, little fella?

56:41.507 --> 56:42.707
He ain't lyin'!

56:42.907 --> 56:46.808
And ladies and gentlemen,
the little man has admonished me

56:46.808 --> 56:49.208
to grasp the broom of reform

56:49.409 --> 56:51.909
and sweep this state clean!

56:52.109 --> 56:55.210
It's gonna be,
"Back to the flour mill, Pappy"!

56:55.310 --> 56:57.710
The interests can take care of themselves!

56:57.810 --> 57:01.711
Come Tuesday, we're gonna
sweep the rascals out!

57:03.512 --> 57:07.413
Clean government is yours for the asking!

57:09.413 --> 57:12.214
Folks, now the little Wharvey gals!

57:13.714 --> 57:17.815
"Wharvey gals"? Did he just say
"Little Wharvey gals"?

57:17.815 --> 57:20.015
Come here, girls.

57:20.216 --> 57:22.016
What y'all gonna sing for us?

57:22.116 --> 57:24.116
"In the Highways".

57:24.316 --> 57:27.417
- God damn it all!
- You know them gals, Everett?

57:27.517 --> 57:28.817
{y:i} In the highways

57:29.017 --> 57:30.718
{y:i} In the hedges

57:30.818 --> 57:33.218
{y:i} In the highways

57:33.318 --> 57:34.919
{y:i} In the hedges

57:35.019 --> 57:37.419
{y:i} In the highways

57:37.519 --> 57:39.320
{y:i} In the hedges

57:39.420 --> 57:43.421
{y:i} I'll be somewhere
{y:i} a-working for my Lord

57:43.421 --> 57:45.421
{y:i} I'll be somewhere a-working

57:45.521 --> 57:47.422
{y:i} I'll be somewhere a-working

57:47.622 --> 57:51.623
{y:i} I'll be somewhere
{y:i} a-working for my Lord

57:51.623 --> 57:53.523
{y:i} I'll be somewhere a-working

57:53.623 --> 57:55.624
{y:i} I'll be somewhere a-working

57:55.824 --> 58:01.125
{y:i} I'll be somewhere
{y:i} a-working for my Lord

58:01.125 --> 58:02.925
Hey, girls!

58:03.025 --> 58:05.326
Daddy! Daddy!

58:05.426 --> 58:07.426
Ha ha ha!

58:07.626 --> 58:09.527
Daddy? He ain't our daddy.

58:09.727 --> 58:12.827
Hell I ain't. What's this Wharvey gals?
Your name's  McGills.

58:12.927 --> 58:15.228
No, sir, not since you
got hit by that train.

58:15.428 --> 58:16.928
What are you talkin' about?
I wasn't hit by a train.

58:17.128 --> 58:21.029
- Mama says you was hit by a train.
- Blooey! Nothin' left.

58:21.129 --> 58:22.830
Just a grease spot on the L & N.

58:23.030 --> 58:25.630
Damn it, I wasn't hit by any train!

58:25.730 --> 58:27.331
That's right, Mama's got
us back to Wharvey.

58:27.531 --> 58:30.631
- That's her maiden name.
- You got a maiden name, Daddy?

58:30.631 --> 58:32.732
No, Daddy don't have a maiden name...

58:32.932 --> 58:34.132
That's your misfortune.

58:34.332 --> 58:37.933
- That's right. And now mama's got a new beau.
- He's a suitor.

58:38.033 --> 58:39.734
Yeah, I heard about that.

58:39.834 --> 58:42.934
Mama says he's bona fide.

58:43.134 --> 58:45.635
Mmm. He give her a ring?

58:45.735 --> 58:47.035
Yes, sir. A big 'un.

58:47.135 --> 58:49.636
- Gold and gems.
- Mama checked it.

58:49.836 --> 58:51.736
- It's bona fide.
- He's a suitor.

58:51.936 --> 58:54.337
- What's his name?
- Vernon T Waldrip.

58:54.437 --> 58:56.237
- Uncle Vernon.
- Till tomorrow.

58:56.337 --> 58:57.638
Then he's gonna be Daddy.

58:57.938 --> 59:01.739
I am the only daddy you got.
I am the damn pater familias.

59:01.739 --> 59:05.239
But you ain't bona fide.

59:06.940 --> 59:08.440
Where's your mama?

59:08.540 --> 59:12.941
- At the Five-and-dime.
- Buying nipples.

59:13.441 --> 59:15.942
{y:i} This way

59:16.042 --> 59:20.143
{y:i} To take me home

59:20.243 --> 59:24.844
{y:i} Kiss me more...

59:27.644 --> 59:31.445
- Daddy!
- Hello, sugar! Ha ha!

59:31.545 --> 59:33.246
How's my little girl?

59:33.446 --> 59:34.946
Hi.

59:35.246 --> 59:37.747
- Who the hell's that?
- Starla Wharvey.

59:37.847 --> 59:39.747
Starla McGill, you mean.

59:39.847 --> 59:42.748
- How come you never told me about her?
- Cos you was hit by a train.

59:42.748 --> 59:45.248
That's another thing. Why are you
telling our gals I was hit by a train?

59:45.448 --> 59:47.949
Lots of respectable people
have been hit by trains.

59:48.149 --> 59:49.949
Judge Hobby, over in Cookeville,
was hit by a train.

59:50.149 --> 59:51.850
What was I supposed to tell them?

59:52.050 --> 59:54.751
That you were sent to the penal farm
and I divorced you from shame?

59:54.751 --> 59:59.252
I take your point. But it does put me in a
damn awkward position vis-á-vis my progeny.

59:59.252 --> 01:00:05.853
Hello, Penny.
Is this gentleman bothering you?

01:00:06.253 --> 01:00:07.553
You Waldrip?

01:00:07.854 --> 01:00:11.054
Uh-huh. That's right.

01:00:11.054 --> 01:00:14.255
Hmm.

01:00:22.957 --> 01:00:25.157
You been using my hair treatment?

01:00:25.257 --> 01:00:27.358
Your hair treatment?

01:00:27.458 --> 01:00:30.859
Excuse me.

01:00:32.359 --> 01:00:36.460
I got news  for you. In case you hadn't
noticed, I wasn't hit by a train,

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:38.961
and I have travelled many a weary mile

01:00:39.061 --> 01:00:43.362
to be back with my wife
and my six daughters.

01:00:43.562 --> 01:00:46.762
- Seven, Daddy!
- That ain't your daddy, Alvanelle.

01:00:46.762 --> 01:00:48.163
Your daddy was hit by a train.

01:00:48.363 --> 01:00:49.763
Penny, you stop that!

01:00:49.963 --> 01:00:51.863
You stop it! Vernon here's got a job.

01:00:52.064 --> 01:00:55.164
Vernon's got prospects.
He's bona fide. What are you?

01:00:55.364 --> 01:00:56.865
I'll tell you what I am...

01:00:57.065 --> 01:01:00.265
I'm the pater familias,
and you can't marry him!

01:01:00.265 --> 01:01:02.266
I can, I am and I will, tomorrow.

01:01:02.466 --> 01:01:04.766
I gotta think about the Wharvey gals.

01:01:04.866 --> 01:01:07.067
They look to me for answers.

01:01:07.167 --> 01:01:09.467
Vernon can buy 'em
lessons on the clarinet.

01:01:09.568 --> 01:01:13.368
The only good thing you ever did for
the gals was get hit by that train!

01:01:13.568 --> 01:01:17.669
Well, you lying, unconstant succubus.

01:01:17.769 --> 01:01:21.770
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
You can't swear at my fiancée!

01:01:21.770 --> 01:01:26.671
Oh, yeah?
Well, you can't marry my wife!

01:01:47.176 --> 01:01:49.977
Who is that man?

01:01:50.077 --> 01:01:52.777
He's not my husband.

01:01:52.977 --> 01:01:58.779
Just a drifter, I guess.
Just some no-account drifter.

01:02:00.679 --> 01:02:04.680
And stay out of the Woolsworth!

01:02:08.681 --> 01:02:11.081
I'll bet she does
imitations, too.

01:02:11.281 --> 01:02:14.182
Deceitful, two-faced she-wolf.

01:02:14.382 --> 01:02:16.683
Never trust a female, Delmar.

01:02:16.783 --> 01:02:21.384
Remember that one simple precept and your
time with me won't have been ill-spent.

01:02:21.484 --> 01:02:24.484
- OK, Everett.
- "Hit by a train".

01:02:24.484 --> 01:02:27.085
Truth means nothing to a woman, Delmar.

01:02:27.185 --> 01:02:30.786
Triumph of the subjective.
You ever been with a woman?

01:02:30.886 --> 01:02:33.587
Well, I've...

01:02:33.787 --> 01:02:37.387
I got to get the family farm back
before I can start thinking about that.

01:02:37.387 --> 01:02:39.288
That's right. If then.

01:02:39.488 --> 01:02:43.489
Believe me Delmar, woman's the
most fiendish instrument of torture

01:02:43.589 --> 01:02:46.189
ever devised to be Devil the days of man.

01:02:46.289 --> 01:02:49.190
Everett, I never figured you
for a pater familias.

01:02:49.290 --> 01:02:53.691
Ohh, yes. I have spread my seed.

01:02:53.791 --> 01:02:55.291
And look what it's...

01:02:57.092 --> 01:03:02.193
God damn it. What the hell...?

01:03:57.606 --> 01:04:02.507
OK, boys.
Enjoy your picture show.

01:04:06.508 --> 01:04:10.108
{y:i} I have no money, honey

01:04:10.108 --> 01:04:12.309
{y:i} How can I change?

01:04:12.409 --> 01:04:18.010
Do... not... seek the treasure.

01:04:19.711 --> 01:04:25.912
Do not... seek the treasure.

01:04:26.012 --> 01:04:27.912
It's a bushwhack.

01:04:28.113 --> 01:04:31.013
They're fixin' an ambush.

01:04:31.113 --> 01:04:35.414
Do not seek the treasure.

01:04:38.215 --> 01:04:43.816
We... we thought you was...

01:04:43.816 --> 01:04:47.017
a toad.

01:04:49.517 --> 01:04:58.619
We... thought...
you... was... a... toad.

01:04:58.519 --> 01:05:02.620
Do not seek the treasure.

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:07.021
Quiet there!
Watch the picture!

01:05:11.122 --> 01:05:12.623
I signed that bill.

01:05:12.923 --> 01:05:15.523
I signed a dozen agriculture bills.

01:05:15.623 --> 01:05:18.424
Everyone knows
I'm a friend of the farmer.

01:05:18.524 --> 01:05:21.325
What I gotta do,
start diddling livestock?

01:05:21.525 --> 01:05:24.725
We can't do that, Daddy.
We might offend our constituency.

01:05:24.825 --> 01:05:30.227
We ain't got a constituency!
Stokes got a constituency!

01:05:30.027 --> 01:05:32.227
Well, it's a well-run campaign.

01:05:32.327 --> 01:05:34.228
Midget and broom and whatnot.

01:05:34.428 --> 01:05:37.328
- Devil his due.
- Hell of an organisation.

01:05:37.428 --> 01:05:40.629
- Say, I got an idea.
- What's that, Junior?

01:05:40.729 --> 01:05:44.430
We can hire us a little fella
even smaller than Stokes's.

01:05:44.430 --> 01:05:46.630
You slump-shouldered sack of nuts!

01:05:46.730 --> 01:05:49.631
Why, we'd look like a bunch
of johnny-come-latelys.

01:05:49.831 --> 01:05:51.832
Bringin' out our own midget.

01:05:51.932 --> 01:05:53.532
Don't matter how stumpy!

01:05:53.632 --> 01:05:58.433
And that's the goddam problem, right there.
people think Stokes has got fresh ideas.

01:05:58.433 --> 01:06:00.533
He's au courant and we're the past!

01:06:00.734 --> 01:06:02.034
It's a problem of...

01:06:02.334 --> 01:06:03.834
- Perception.
- That's right.

01:06:04.034 --> 01:06:06.935
- He's pulling our pants down.
- Gonna paddle some behind.

01:06:07.035 --> 01:06:09.235
Ain't gonna paddle it.
Gonna kick it. Real hard.

01:06:09.435 --> 01:06:13.036
- No, I believe he's gonna paddle it.
- I don't believe that's a proper description.

01:06:13.036 --> 01:06:19.038
- Well, that's how I'd characterise it.
- I believe it's more of a kickin' situation.

01:06:32.941 --> 01:06:38.442
God... God forgive me.

01:06:38.342 --> 01:06:42.643
I could not gaze upon that fireshow.

01:06:42.643 --> 01:06:45.644
- Pete.

01:06:45.844 --> 01:06:50.345
- Hold still!
- Can't... stand much longer.

01:06:50.445 --> 01:06:53.345
It was... it was
a mo-moment of weakness.

01:06:53.545 --> 01:06:55.446
Quit babblin', we gotta skedaddle.

01:06:55.646 --> 01:06:57.646
That's all I got.

01:06:57.846 --> 01:06:59.447
They lured me out for a bathe

01:06:59.547 --> 01:07:03.048
and then they dunked me,
and trussed me up like a hog,

01:07:03.248 --> 01:07:04.948
and turned me in for the bounty.

01:07:05.048 --> 01:07:07.749
Shoulda guessed it.
Typical womanly behaviour.

01:07:07.849 --> 01:07:10.349
Just lucky we left before
they came back for us.

01:07:10.449 --> 01:07:12.250
We didn't abandon you, Pete.

01:07:12.350 --> 01:07:14.550
We just thought you was a toad.

01:07:14.650 --> 01:07:17.051
No, they never did turn me into a toad.

01:07:17.151 --> 01:07:19.951
Well, that was our mistake, then.

01:07:20.052 --> 01:07:24.953
And we was beat up by a Bible salesman
and banished from Woolworths.

01:07:24.953 --> 01:07:27.953
I don't know, Everett, was it
the one branch or all of them?

01:07:28.153 --> 01:07:30.854
Well, I ain't had it easy, either, boys.

01:07:31.054 --> 01:07:35.755
Frankly, uh, well, I...

01:07:36.355 --> 01:07:38.856
I spilt my guts about the treasure.

01:07:39.056 --> 01:07:41.656
Huh?

01:07:41.856 --> 01:07:46.057
I'm awful sorry I betrayed you, fellas.

01:07:46.057 --> 01:07:49.658
Must be my Hogwallop blood.

01:07:50.458 --> 01:07:52.259
That's all right, Pete.

01:07:52.459 --> 01:07:55.460
Awful white of you to take it
like that, Everett.

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:58.060
I feel wretched.

01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:01.761
Spoiling your play for
a million dollar point two.

01:08:01.961 --> 01:08:04.962
You should rip out my guts.

01:08:04.962 --> 01:08:07.262
No, that's all right.

01:08:09.163 --> 01:08:13.864
You boys are true friends! Ohh!

01:08:13.664 --> 01:08:16.363
You're my beaucoup friends.

01:08:16.464 --> 01:08:20.365
Pete, I don't want you to
beat yourself up about this, eh?

01:08:20.465 --> 01:08:28.067
I can't help it, but that's a...
a wonderful thing to say.

01:08:29.466 --> 01:08:33.968
Yeah. Pete, uh...

01:08:34.468 --> 01:08:38.769
Well, fact of the matter is...

01:08:40.670 --> 01:08:42.270
Damn it...

01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:45.770
There ain't no treasure.

01:08:47.371 --> 01:08:49.671
Fact of the matter is there never was.

01:08:49.772 --> 01:08:51.572
But...

01:08:51.671 --> 01:08:57.573
So where's all the money
from the armoured car job?

01:08:57.374 --> 01:09:00.174
I never knocked over no armoured car.

01:09:00.274 --> 01:09:03.675
I was sent up for practising
law without a license.

01:09:03.774 --> 01:09:05.475
- But...
- Damn it, I had to bust out.

01:09:05.675 --> 01:09:10.977
My wife wrote me she was getting
married, I gotta stop it.

01:09:10.877 --> 01:09:13.877
I had two weeks left on my sentence.

01:09:14.077 --> 01:09:16.078
I couldn't wait two weeks.
She's getting married tomorrow.

01:09:16.278 --> 01:09:24.380
My added time for the escape,
I don't get out now till 19... 87.

01:09:24.279 --> 01:09:25.979
Now, I am sorry about that.

01:09:26.279 --> 01:09:31.581
I'll be... 84 years old.

01:09:31.481 --> 01:09:35.381
I guess they'll tack on
50 years for me, too.

01:09:35.482 --> 01:09:39.783
Boys, we was chained together.
I had to tell you something.

01:09:39.883 --> 01:09:45.084
Busting out alone was not
an option. I'm sorry.

01:09:45.184 --> 01:09:48.785
84 years old.

01:09:48.685 --> 01:09:51.986
Well, I'll only be 82.

01:09:52.185 --> 01:09:54.887
You! You ruined my life!

01:09:54.987 --> 01:09:57.687
You ruined my life!

01:09:57.787 --> 01:09:59.888
I do apologize about that, Pete.

01:09:59.988 --> 01:10:04.389
84 years old! I'm becoming Papillon!

01:10:04.389 --> 01:10:05.889
Delmar!

01:10:09.990 --> 01:10:13.791
Now, boys. Boys.

01:10:26.294 --> 01:10:33.295
{y:i} Eeny meeny meiny mo

01:10:33.295 --> 01:10:37.396
{y:i} Oh hi lo hi

01:10:37.396 --> 01:10:41.097
{y:i} Oh hi lo

01:10:41.197 --> 01:10:46.898
{y:i} Oh oh-ohhhh...

01:11:09.303 --> 01:11:14.705
{y:i} Oh death

01:11:14.605 --> 01:11:19.806
{y:i} Whoa death

01:11:19.806 --> 01:11:24.807
{y:i} Won't you spare me over
{y:i} till another year?

01:11:29.608 --> 01:11:32.609
{y:i} Well, I am death, none can excel

01:11:32.809 --> 01:11:37.110
{y:i} I'll open the door
{y:i} to heaven or hell

01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:39.810
{y:i} Whoa, death, someone would pray

01:11:39.910 --> 01:11:44.712
{y:i} Could you wait to call me
{y:i} another day?

01:11:44.812 --> 01:11:45.812
{y:i} Children pray...

01:11:46.012 --> 01:11:50.513
That's Tommy.
They got Tommy!

01:11:51.313 --> 01:11:52.613
Noose.

01:11:52.713 --> 01:11:55.714
{y:i} No longer prayin'...

01:11:55.914 --> 01:12:00.315
Sweet Jesus, we got to save him.

01:12:00.315 --> 01:12:03.016
{y:i} I'll fix your feet
{y:i} till you can't walk

01:12:03.116 --> 01:12:08.217
{y:i} I'll lock your jaw
{y:i} till you can't talk

01:12:08.317 --> 01:12:11.518
{y:i} I'll close your eyes
{y:i} so you can't see

01:12:11.618 --> 01:12:16.119
{y:i} - It's very dark...
- The colour guard.

01:12:16.319 --> 01:12:19.819
{y:i} Death, I come to take the soul

01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:24.621
{y:i} Leave the body and leave it cold

01:12:24.621 --> 01:12:28.121
{y:i} Oh death

01:12:28.221 --> 01:12:32.422
{y:i} Whoa death

01:12:32.522 --> 01:12:38.224
{y:i} Won't you spare me over
{y:i} till another year?

01:12:39.724 --> 01:12:42.425
Brothers!

01:12:42.625 --> 01:12:45.225
Oh, brothers!

01:12:45.425 --> 01:12:53.227
We have all gathered here to preserve
our hallowed culture and heritage

01:12:53.127 --> 01:12:59.028
from intrusion,
inclusion and dilution

01:12:59.128 --> 01:13:01.929
of colour, of creed,

01:13:02.129 --> 01:13:04.130
and of our old-time religion.

01:13:04.230 --> 01:13:08.731
We aim to pull evil up by the root

01:13:08.831 --> 01:13:14.832
before it chokes out the flower
of our culture and heritage.

01:13:14.732 --> 01:13:18.533
And our women, let's not
forget those ladies, y'all,

01:13:18.633 --> 01:13:21.433
looking to us for protection

01:13:21.633 --> 01:13:26.435
from Darkies, from Jews, from Papists,

01:13:26.435 --> 01:13:29.135
and from all those smart-ass folks

01:13:29.235 --> 01:13:32.136
say we come descended from monkeys.

01:13:32.236 --> 01:13:35.437
- That's not my culture and heritage.
- Yes!

01:13:35.437 --> 01:13:36.837
Is that your culture and heritage?

01:13:37.137 --> 01:13:39.237
No!

01:13:39.438 --> 01:13:41.938
And so...

01:13:42.138 --> 01:13:44.039
we gonna hang us a Negro.

01:13:44.139 --> 01:13:47.939
Hooray!

01:13:57.242 --> 01:14:02.343
I ain't never harmed you,
neither of you gentlemen.

01:14:02.943 --> 01:14:06.944
Uh...

01:14:19.247 --> 01:14:23.347
Mm-hmm.

01:14:23.247 --> 01:14:27.148
I ain't never harmed nobody.

01:14:28.649 --> 01:14:30.949
- Hey, hey, Tommy.
- Huh?

01:14:31.049 --> 01:14:32.850
Tommy, we come to rescue you.

01:14:32.950 --> 01:14:35.050
That's mighty kind of you boys,

01:14:35.250 --> 01:14:38.451
but I don't think nothing's
going to save me now.

01:14:38.451 --> 01:14:42.352
The Devil's come
to collect his due.

01:14:42.552 --> 01:14:44.452
Don't be crazy, Tommy.

01:14:44.552 --> 01:14:46.353
You don't wanna get hanged.

01:14:46.453 --> 01:14:48.553
Well, naw, I don't reckon I do,

01:14:48.753 --> 01:14:52.854
but that's the way it seems
to be workin' out.

01:14:54.054 --> 01:14:55.755
Listen, Tommy, I got a plan.

01:14:58.555 --> 01:15:01.056
No!

01:15:05.057 --> 01:15:06.857
The colour guard is coloured.

01:15:08.858 --> 01:15:12.359
Who made them the colour guard?

01:15:13.659 --> 01:15:15.959
Run, boys!

01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:22.161
Whoa!

01:15:22.361 --> 01:15:23.461
No, no, son!

01:15:26.262 --> 01:15:30.963
Can't let that flag
touch the ground!

01:15:53.468 --> 01:15:55.468
Get your hand off me.
I can do this myself.

01:15:55.668 --> 01:15:58.169
Get away from here. I didn't
tell you to sit over here.

01:15:58.169 --> 01:16:00.069
I'm saying we should hire this man away.

01:16:00.369 --> 01:16:02.670
- That's a good idea, Pappy.
- Hell of an idea.

01:16:02.770 --> 01:16:03.670
Can't beat 'em, join 'em.

01:16:03.770 --> 01:16:06.471
Have him join us, run our campaign,
instead of that egghead's.

01:16:06.571 --> 01:16:10.672
- Enticements of power, wealth, et cetera.
- No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.

01:16:10.672 --> 01:16:14.373
- Oh, gracious, no, not with his blandishments.
- And powers of persuasion.

01:16:14.573 --> 01:16:17.573
- What's his name again?
- The campaign manager?

01:16:17.673 --> 01:16:19.374
- Waldrip.
- Vernon Waldrip.

01:16:19.574 --> 01:16:23.075
- Vernon T Waldrip.
- Hmm.

01:16:27.876 --> 01:16:30.076
It's an invitation-only affair.

01:16:30.176 --> 01:16:32.077
We'll have to sneak in at
the service entrance.

01:16:32.277 --> 01:16:34.677
Hold on. Wait a minute.

01:16:34.777 --> 01:16:37.078
Who elected you leader of this outfit?

01:16:37.278 --> 01:16:41.379
Since we've been following your lead,
we got nothing but trouble.

01:16:41.379 --> 01:16:44.179
I've gotten this close to being strung up

01:16:44.279 --> 01:16:47.380
and consumed in a fire and whipped no end

01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:49.181
and sunstroked and soggied.

01:16:49.381 --> 01:16:50.781
And turned into a frog.

01:16:50.981 --> 01:16:52.481
He wasn't turned into a frog.

01:16:52.581 --> 01:16:56.882
Almost loved up, though.

01:16:56.882 --> 01:16:59.883
So, you're against me now, too?

01:17:00.083 --> 01:17:03.684
Is that how it is, boys?

01:17:04.184 --> 01:17:10.785
The whole world and God Almighty...
and now you?

01:17:13.386 --> 01:17:15.286
I guess I deserve it.

01:17:15.487 --> 01:17:19.087
Boys...

01:17:19.187 --> 01:17:22.088
I know that I made some
tactical mistakes,

01:17:22.288 --> 01:17:25.389
but if you just stick with me,
I got a plan.

01:17:25.389 --> 01:17:27.689
Believe me, boys, we
can fix this thing.

01:17:27.889 --> 01:17:30.390
And I'll get my wife back,
and we can get out of here.

01:17:34.291 --> 01:17:37.191
Goddam disgrace!

01:17:37.191 --> 01:17:39.792
Made a travesty of the entire evening.

01:17:39.892 --> 01:17:43.693
Ohh! What I wouldn't give
to get a hold of those agitators.

01:17:43.793 --> 01:17:47.494
I mean, whoever heard of such behaviour,
even amongst the coloured?

01:17:47.694 --> 01:17:52.295
Mulattos, maybe. I suspect some miscegenation
in their heritage. How else you gonna explain it?

01:17:52.295 --> 01:17:54.995
Using a Confederate flag as a missile!

01:17:55.196 --> 01:17:58.496
Crazy! No one's ever gonna
believe we're a real band.

01:17:58.496 --> 01:18:01.397
This gonna work. I just gotta get
close enough to talk to her.

01:18:01.497 --> 01:18:04.998
Coming with us has more future
than marrying a guy named Waldrip.

01:18:04.998 --> 01:18:07.498
I'm goddam bona fide.
I got the answers.

01:18:07.698 --> 01:18:10.899
Everett, my beard itches.

01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:18.701
Hey, hey!

01:18:21.501 --> 01:18:26.002
"In the Jailhouse Now", fellas.
Neighbourhood of B.

01:18:31.604 --> 01:18:33.604
Psst!

01:18:33.704 --> 01:18:37.705
Penny. Ahem.

01:18:38.005 --> 01:18:42.806
- It's me.
- No.

01:18:42.706 --> 01:18:44.107
Honey!

01:18:44.307 --> 01:18:48.007
{y:i} I had a friend named Ramblin' Bob

01:18:48.007 --> 01:18:50.708
{y:i} He used to steal, gamble and rob

01:18:50.908 --> 01:18:56.009
{y:i} He thought he was
{y:i} the smartest guy around

01:18:56.109 --> 01:18:57.410
{y:i} Well, I...

01:18:57.610 --> 01:19:02.311
We're leaving the state, pursuing
opportunities in another venue.

01:19:02.311 --> 01:19:04.411
I've got big plans.

01:19:04.611 --> 01:19:07.312
Not minstrelsy. This here's just a dodge.
I'm going to be a dentist.

01:19:07.412 --> 01:19:12.113
I know this guy who'll
print me up a license.

01:19:12.113 --> 01:19:15.214
{y:i} He's in the jailhouse now

01:19:15.314 --> 01:19:18.814
{y:i} Well, I told him once or twice

01:19:19.015 --> 01:19:23.115
{y:i} To stop playin' cards
{y:i} and a-shootin' dice

01:19:23.115 --> 01:19:26.716
{y:i} He's in the jailhouse now

01:19:26.816 --> 01:19:29.117
{y:i} Ah hee yodel-lay-hee-hoo

01:19:29.117 --> 01:19:32.718
{y:i} Yo heeeeee

01:19:33.018 --> 01:19:34.918
{y:i} Ah dee yodel-lay-hee

01:19:35.018 --> 01:19:38.819
{y:i} Oh de-lo tee

01:19:38.819 --> 01:19:41.820
{y:i} Yodel-lay-hee hee,
{y:i} yodel-lay-hee hee

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:45.821
{y:i} Yodel-lay-heeeee

01:19:46.121 --> 01:19:48.121
{y:i} Bob liked to play his poker...

01:19:50.222 --> 01:19:52.522
Why, that is an improper suggestion.

01:19:52.622 --> 01:19:57.723
I-I-I can't switch sides
in the middle of a campaign...

01:19:57.623 --> 01:20:01.124
especially to work for a man
who lacks moral fibre.

01:20:01.224 --> 01:20:04.525
Moral fibre?
Why, you pasty-face son'bitch.

01:20:04.625 --> 01:20:06.225
I invented moral fibre.

01:20:06.425 --> 01:20:09.726
Pappy O'Daniel was displaying
rectitude and high-mindedness while

01:20:09.726 --> 01:20:12.127
that egghead you work for
was still messin' his drawers!

01:20:12.227 --> 01:20:15.027
- Psst! Honey.
- Go away.

01:20:15.127 --> 01:20:17.628
I want to be what
you want me to be, honey.

01:20:17.728 --> 01:20:20.528
I want you and the gals
to come with me.

01:20:20.729 --> 01:20:25.430
{y:i} To stop playin' cards
{y:i} and a-shootin' dice...

01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:28.830
What are you doing here, Pappy?

01:20:28.930 --> 01:20:31.031
I guess someone let on
we were giving out liquor.

01:20:31.131 --> 01:20:34.032
You'll be laughing out the other
side of your face come November.

01:20:34.232 --> 01:20:35.932
Pappy O'Daniel will be laughing then.

01:20:36.132 --> 01:20:39.733
- Not out the other side of his face, though.
- No. Just the regular side.

01:20:39.833 --> 01:20:43.834
{y:i} Yodel-lay-hee hee,
{y:i} yodel-lay-hee hee

01:20:44.034 --> 01:20:48.435
{y:i} Yodel-lay-heeeeee

01:20:53.036 --> 01:20:55.236
They're my daughters, too, Penny.

01:20:55.336 --> 01:20:56.837
Ain't you ever heard of...?

01:20:57.037 --> 01:20:59.337
{y:i} In constant sorrow

01:21:15.841 --> 01:21:19.742
{y:i} I am the man

01:21:19.742 --> 01:21:22.442
{y:i} Of constant sorrow

01:21:22.643 --> 01:21:25.043
{y:i} I've seen trouble...

01:21:25.143 --> 01:21:27.844
Hot damn! It's the Soggy Bottom Boys!

01:21:28.044 --> 01:21:32.645
{y:i} I bid farewell

01:21:32.645 --> 01:21:34.645
{y:i} To old Kentucky

01:21:34.745 --> 01:21:40.347
{y:i} The place where
{y:i} I was born and raised

01:21:40.447 --> 01:21:42.947
{y:i} The place where he

01:21:42.947 --> 01:21:47.248
{y:i} Was born and raised...

01:21:54.650 --> 01:21:58.151
Whoo!

01:22:05.752 --> 01:22:08.253
Holy moly! These boys are a hit!

01:22:08.353 --> 01:22:10.753
But, Pappy, they's integrated.

01:22:10.953 --> 01:22:13.254
Wait a minute.

01:22:13.254 --> 01:22:15.655
Well, I guess folks don't mind integration.

01:22:15.855 --> 01:22:19.956
You's miscegenated.
All you boys is miscegenated!

01:22:20.056 --> 01:22:21.256
Gimme a microphone!

01:22:21.456 --> 01:22:24.557
Gimme a microphone!
Gimme a microphone!

01:22:24.757 --> 01:22:30.058
These boys is not white.
Hell, they ain't even old-timey.

01:22:30.058 --> 01:22:32.558
I happen to know, ladies and gentlemen,

01:22:32.658 --> 01:22:35.459
that this band of miscreants
here, this very evening,

01:22:35.659 --> 01:22:41.060
interfered with a lynch mob
in the performance of its duties.

01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:42.561
It's true!

01:22:42.661 --> 01:22:45.161
See, I belong to a
certain secret society.

01:22:45.361 --> 01:22:48.362
I don't believe I gotta
mention its name, you know?

01:22:48.462 --> 01:22:50.863
Let 'em play! Go on!
I wanna hear them sing.

01:22:50.963 --> 01:22:52.363
Hmm.

01:22:52.563 --> 01:22:54.463
And these boys here,

01:22:54.563 --> 01:22:58.364
they trampled all over our
venerated observances and rituals.

01:22:58.364 --> 01:23:01.265
Now, this here music is
over, all right?

01:23:01.365 --> 01:23:02.865
And I have... No! Hey!

01:23:03.065 --> 01:23:05.566
Hey, I ain't... listen to me.

01:23:05.766 --> 01:23:07.766
Folks, listen to me. I...

01:23:07.866 --> 01:23:11.067
These boys desecrated a fiery cross.

01:23:12.167 --> 01:23:14.368
We's all havin' a good time!

01:23:14.468 --> 01:23:18.569
And they's convicts, folks,
fugitives escaped off the farm.

01:23:18.669 --> 01:23:22.470
Now, folks, these boys gotta
be remanded to the authorities.

01:23:22.570 --> 01:23:23.870
Criminals!

01:23:23.970 --> 01:23:26.371
And I have it from
the highest authority

01:23:26.471 --> 01:23:29.571
that that Negro sold
his soul to the Devil!

01:23:29.671 --> 01:23:31.272
Oh!

01:23:31.372 --> 01:23:34.472
W-W-Wait a minute, folks.
It's true!

01:23:34.672 --> 01:23:35.473
It's true!

01:23:36.673 --> 01:23:37.773
Wait a minute.

01:23:37.973 --> 01:23:41.074
Is you is, or is you
ain't my constituency?

01:23:41.274 --> 01:23:42.274
No!

01:23:42.374 --> 01:23:44.875
Is you is, or is you
ain't my constituency?

01:23:45.075 --> 01:23:47.175
No!

01:23:47.275 --> 01:23:49.876
Is you is...

01:23:50.076 --> 01:23:54.377
Is you is, or is you
ain't my constituency?

01:23:54.477 --> 01:23:56.878
Oh, come on, folks.

01:23:57.078 --> 01:23:58.578
No. It's Homer now.

01:23:58.778 --> 01:24:00.878
I'm a friend of the little man.

01:24:11.681 --> 01:24:14.882
This is not fair!
Hey! Come on!

01:24:17.882 --> 01:24:23.484
Come on, we got a little
misunderstanding here. God damn!

01:24:27.785 --> 01:24:32.186
{y:i} It's fair to tell

01:24:32.186 --> 01:24:34.786
{y:i} My only lover

01:24:34.886 --> 01:24:37.287
{y:i} I never expect

01:24:37.487 --> 01:24:41.088
{y:i} To see you again

01:24:41.288 --> 01:24:45.489
{y:i} For I'm bound to ride

01:24:45.689 --> 01:24:48.389
{y:i} That northern railroad

01:24:48.389 --> 01:24:53.290
{y:i} Perhaps I'll die upon that train

01:24:53.390 --> 01:24:58.992
{y:i} Perhaps he'll die
{y:i} upon his train...

01:24:58.992 --> 01:25:02.392
God damn! Opportunity knocks!

01:25:02.492 --> 01:25:04.793
Get out of my way!

01:25:04.993 --> 01:25:07.494
{y:i} I'm just a stranger

01:25:07.594 --> 01:25:10.194
{y:i} In case you ever

01:25:10.394 --> 01:25:12.595
{y:i} See your man...

01:25:13.895 --> 01:25:18.596
{y:i} But there is one promise

01:25:18.596 --> 01:25:20.797
{y:i} That is given

01:25:20.997 --> 01:25:23.397
{y:i} I'll meet you on

01:25:23.597 --> 01:25:26.198
{y:i} God's golden shore

01:25:26.398 --> 01:25:29.098
{y:i} He'll meet you on

01:25:29.198 --> 01:25:31.799
{y:i} God's golden shore

01:25:31.899 --> 01:25:35.800
That's fine. That's fine!

01:25:38.301 --> 01:25:40.801
Ladies and gentlemans,

01:25:40.901 --> 01:25:43.302
here and listening at home,

01:25:43.402 --> 01:25:46.502
the great state of Mississippi...

01:25:46.602 --> 01:25:48.503
Pappy O'Daniel, Governor...

01:25:48.703 --> 01:25:54.604
wants to thank the Soggy Bottom Boys
for that wonderful performance.

01:25:56.705 --> 01:26:00.506
And it looks like the only man
in this great state

01:26:00.606 --> 01:26:02.506
who ain't a music lover

01:26:02.706 --> 01:26:06.307
is my esteemed opponent
in the upcoming, Homer Stokes.

01:26:06.407 --> 01:26:08.907
There ain't no accounting for taste.

01:26:10.308 --> 01:26:13.408
Sounded to me like he was harbouring
some kind of hateful grudge

01:26:13.508 --> 01:26:15.309
against the Soggy Bottom Boys

01:26:15.409 --> 01:26:17.909
on account of their
rough and rowdy past.

01:26:19.910 --> 01:26:22.911
Looks like Homer Stokes
is the kind of fellow

01:26:23.011 --> 01:26:25.311
who wants to cast the first stone.

01:26:25.411 --> 01:26:28.112
Well, I'm with you, folks.

01:26:28.312 --> 01:26:31.413
I'm a forgive-and-forget
Christian, and I say...

01:26:31.513 --> 01:26:37.114
if their rambunctiousness and
misdemeanoring is behind them...

01:26:37.114 --> 01:26:38.214
It is, ain't it?

01:26:38.314 --> 01:26:40.015
Yes, sir, it is.

01:26:40.215 --> 01:26:42.215
Well, then, I say,

01:26:42.315 --> 01:26:44.716
by the power vested in me,

01:26:44.816 --> 01:26:49.217
these boys is hereby pardoned!

01:26:51.617 --> 01:26:54.018
And furthermore...

01:26:54.218 --> 01:26:56.918
in the second Pappy
O'Daniel administration,

01:26:57.018 --> 01:27:00.319
these boys is gonna be my brain trust!

01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:06.220
What's that mean, Everett?

01:27:06.420 --> 01:27:10.421
Well Delmar, it means you and me
and Pete and Tommy are gonna be

01:27:10.621 --> 01:27:12.822
the power behind the
throne, so to speak.

01:27:13.022 --> 01:27:15.623
Oh, OK.

01:27:15.723 --> 01:27:20.424
So, without further ado, and
by way of endorsing my candidacy,

01:27:20.424 --> 01:27:21.924
the Soggy Bottom Boys

01:27:22.124 --> 01:27:26.325
is gonna lead us all in a
chorus of "You Are My Sunshine".

01:27:27.425 --> 01:27:30.126
Ain't you, boys?

01:27:30.026 --> 01:27:31.226
One of our favourites.

01:27:31.526 --> 01:27:36.327
Son... you're gonna go far.

01:27:36.127 --> 01:27:38.628
{y:i} You are my sunshine

01:27:38.728 --> 01:27:41.028
{y:i} My only sunshine

01:27:41.228 --> 01:27:43.729
{y:i} You make me happy

01:27:43.829 --> 01:27:46.129
{y:i} When skies are grey

01:27:46.230 --> 01:27:48.730
{y:i} You'll never know, dear

01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:51.531
{y:i} How much I love you

01:27:51.731 --> 01:27:53.131
{y:i} Please don't take

01:27:53.331 --> 01:27:57.932
{y:i} My sunshine away

01:28:00.133 --> 01:28:03.733
I guess Vernon T Waldrip
is gonna be going on relief.

01:28:03.733 --> 01:28:06.634
Maybe I can throw a
little patronage his way,

01:28:06.734 --> 01:28:09.735
get him a job digging ditches
or rounding up stray dogs.

01:28:09.735 --> 01:28:12.235
So, is the marriage off, Miss Wharvey?

01:28:12.435 --> 01:28:16.036
McGill. No. The marriage
will take place as planned.

01:28:16.136 --> 01:28:17.437
With little change of cast.

01:28:17.537 --> 01:28:20.237
Me and the little lady are
gonna pick up the pieces

01:28:20.437 --> 01:28:23.638
and re-tie the knot,
mixaphorically speaking.

01:28:23.738 --> 01:28:25.838
You boys are invited, of course.

01:28:26.039 --> 01:28:27.739
Hell, you're the best men.

01:28:27.939 --> 01:28:30.139
I already got the rings.

01:28:30.340 --> 01:28:33.940
- Where's your ring, honey?
- I ain't worn it since our divorce came true.

01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:37.141
Must still be in the roll-top in the
old cabin. Never thought I'd need it.

01:28:37.241 --> 01:28:39.542
Vernon bought one, encrusted with jewels.

01:28:39.742 --> 01:28:42.942
Now's the time to buy it off him cheap.

01:28:42.942 --> 01:28:46.643
We ain't getting married with
his ring. You said you'd changed.

01:28:46.843 --> 01:28:49.244
- Yours is just an old pewter thing.
- There ain't gonna be no weddin'.

01:28:49.444 --> 01:28:51.944
- It's just a symbol, honey.
- No wedding.

01:28:51.944 --> 01:28:53.345
We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.

01:28:53.645 --> 01:28:56.445
It's just... Shut up, Delmar.
It's just a symbol.

01:28:56.545 --> 01:29:00.046
I've spoken my piece and counted to three.

01:29:00.146 --> 01:29:03.947
She counted to three. God damn it.

01:29:04.047 --> 01:29:06.948
She counted to three. Son of a bitch!

01:29:07.048 --> 01:29:09.548
You have any idea how far that cabin is?

01:29:25.652 --> 01:29:26.952
George?

01:29:27.052 --> 01:29:28.753
Hello, boys!

01:29:28.953 --> 01:29:33.154
Well, these little men finally caught
up with the criminal of the century.

01:29:33.154 --> 01:29:35.354
Looks like the chair for George Nelson!

01:29:35.454 --> 01:29:41.956
Yup, gonna electrify me. I'm gonna
go off like a roman candle!

01:29:41.956 --> 01:29:45.357
20,000 volts chasing a rabbit
through yours truly!

01:29:45.557 --> 01:29:49.257
Goddamn, I'm gonna suck all
the power right out of the state!

01:29:49.357 --> 01:29:53.958
Gonna shoot sparks out of my head
and lightning from my fingertips!

01:29:53.958 --> 01:29:58.359
I'm George Nelson, and I'm
feeling ten feet tall!

01:29:58.359 --> 01:30:03.161
Looks like George is
right back on top again.

01:30:03.261 --> 01:30:04.461
Cow killer!

01:30:17.064 --> 01:30:20.765
Well, at least you boys get
to see the ancestral manse,

01:30:20.965 --> 01:30:25.466
the home where I spent so many
happy day in the bosom of my family.

01:30:25.566 --> 01:30:28.866
Refugin', if you will, with
a mighty oak tree out front

01:30:28.866 --> 01:30:33.367
and a happy little tyre swing on it.

01:30:36.468 --> 01:30:41.569
Where's the happy little tyre swing?

01:30:41.769 --> 01:30:44.870
End of the road, boys.

01:30:44.970 --> 01:30:47.071
- No. Wait a minute.
- Let's go, boys.

01:30:47.171 --> 01:30:51.672
It's had its twists and turns,
now it deposits you here.

01:30:51.772 --> 01:30:52.872
Wait a minute.

01:30:53.072 --> 01:30:58.573
You have eluded fate and you have
eluded me for the last time.

01:30:58.473 --> 01:31:01.574
- Tie their hands, boys.
- You can't do this, now.

01:31:01.674 --> 01:31:04.474
Didn't know you'd be bringing a friend.

01:31:04.574 --> 01:31:08.675
He'll just have to wait his turn,
share one of your graves.

01:31:08.675 --> 01:31:12.176
You can't do it, we just got
pardoned by the Governor himself!

01:31:12.276 --> 01:31:16.377
- It went out on the radio.
- Is that right?

01:31:19.078 --> 01:31:22.979
Well, we ain't got a radio.

01:31:23.979 --> 01:31:27.780
God have mercy.

01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:33.381
{y:i} You

01:31:33.481 --> 01:31:35.181
{y:i} Got to go

01:31:35.381 --> 01:31:38.182
{y:i} To that lonesome valley

01:31:38.282 --> 01:31:42.083
{y:i} You

01:31:42.183 --> 01:31:48.284
{y:i} Whoa, got...

01:31:48.184 --> 01:31:49.785
It ain't fittin'.

01:31:49.985 --> 01:31:51.285
It ain't the law.

01:31:51.385 --> 01:31:54.686
- The law?
{y:i} To go...

01:31:54.786 --> 01:31:57.887
The law is a human institution.

01:31:57.987 --> 01:32:01.487
{y:i} Nobody else

01:32:01.687 --> 01:32:04.488
{y:i} Can go there for you, no...

01:32:04.588 --> 01:32:07.489
Perhaps you should start
making your prayers.

01:32:07.589 --> 01:32:12.390
{y:i} Whoa

01:32:12.390 --> 01:32:18.891
{y:i} Got

01:32:18.791 --> 01:32:20.492
{y:i} To go...

01:32:20.592 --> 01:32:24.993
Oh, my God. Everett?

01:32:25.193 --> 01:32:28.594
Tommy, I'm sorry we got you into this.

01:32:28.694 --> 01:32:32.394
Good Lord... What do we do?

01:32:32.494 --> 01:32:38.496
{y:i} By yourself

01:32:38.596 --> 01:32:41.797
{y:i} Whoa...

01:32:41.897 --> 01:32:44.797
Oh, Lord...

01:32:44.897 --> 01:32:49.798
Please look down and
recognise us poor sinners.

01:32:51.099 --> 01:32:53.099
Please, Lord.

01:32:53.399 --> 01:32:57.200
I just want to see my daughters again.

01:32:57.300 --> 01:33:01.201
I've been separated
from my family for so long.

01:33:01.201 --> 01:33:04.602
I know I've been guilty of
pride and sharp dealing.

01:33:04.702 --> 01:33:06.902
I'm sorry that I turned my back on you,

01:33:07.102 --> 01:33:10.003
forgive me.

01:33:10.003 --> 01:33:12.904
We're helpless, Lord.

01:33:13.004 --> 01:33:16.504
For the sake of my family,
for Tommy's sake.

01:33:16.704 --> 01:33:20.405
For Delmar's and Pete's.

01:33:21.406 --> 01:33:25.406
Let me see my daughters again, Lord.

01:33:25.706 --> 01:33:30.708
Help us, please.

01:33:43.611 --> 01:33:47.811
{y:i} You got to go

01:33:47.811 --> 01:33:50.812
{y:i} To the lonesome valley

01:33:50.912 --> 01:34:00.214
{y:i} Yes, sir, you, whoa

01:34:00.014 --> 01:34:05.415
{y:i} Got

01:34:05.415 --> 01:34:10.417
{y:i} To go

01:34:10.517 --> 01:34:13.817
{y:i} There

01:34:13.917 --> 01:34:15.918
{y:i} Hey

01:34:16.018 --> 01:34:19.819
{y:i} By

01:34:19.919 --> 01:34:22.419
{y:i} Yourself

01:34:22.519 --> 01:34:25.420
{y:i} Nobody else

01:34:25.420 --> 01:34:29.221
{y:i} Nobody else can go for you

01:34:29.321 --> 01:34:35.622
{y:i} You, whoa

01:34:37.523 --> 01:34:43.824
{y:i} Got

01:34:43.824 --> 01:34:47.925
{y:i} To go

01:34:48.025 --> 01:34:51.826
{y:i} There

01:34:51.826 --> 01:34:53.926
{y:i} Ohh

01:34:54.027 --> 01:34:58.828
{y:i} By

01:34:58.928 --> 01:35:01.728
{y:i} Yourself

01:35:01.928 --> 01:35:07.430
{y:i} Mmmm

01:35:35.836 --> 01:35:37.636
Ahh. Ahh.

01:35:37.736 --> 01:35:41.537
- A miracle. It was a miracle!
- Delmar, don't be ignorant.

01:35:41.737 --> 01:35:44.138
I told you they were
flooding this valley.

01:35:44.238 --> 01:35:47.639
- No! That ain't it!
- We prayed to God and he pitied us!

01:35:47.739 --> 01:35:49.139
Well, it never fails.

01:35:49.239 --> 01:35:52.940
Once again you two hayseeds are showin'
how much you want for intellect.

01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:55.741
There's a perfectly scientific
explanation for what just happened.

01:35:55.841 --> 01:35:59.141
That ain't the tune you was
singin' back at the gallows!

01:35:59.241 --> 01:36:02.242
Well, any human being'll cast
about in a moment of stress.

01:36:02.442 --> 01:36:04.342
No, the fact is, they're
flooding this valley

01:36:04.542 --> 01:36:07.843
so they can hydroelectric
up the whole darn state.

01:36:07.943 --> 01:36:10.844
Yes, sir, the South is gonna change.

01:36:10.844 --> 01:36:13.645
Everything's gonna be put on electricity
and run on a payin' basis.

01:36:13.845 --> 01:36:18.146
Out with the old spiritual mumbo-jumbo,
the superstitions and the backward ways.

01:36:18.246 --> 01:36:23.447
We gonna see a brave new world where they run
everybody a wire and hook us up to a grid.

01:36:23.447 --> 01:36:25.547
Yes, sir, a veritable age of reason.

01:36:25.747 --> 01:36:31.049
Like the one they had in France.
Not a moment too soon.

01:36:33.749 --> 01:36:37.950
Not a moment too soon.

01:36:38.050 --> 01:36:39.450
Hey, there's Tommy.

01:36:39.650 --> 01:36:42.351
Tommy, what you ridin' there?

01:36:42.451 --> 01:36:45.452
Unh! Whoa.

01:36:45.552 --> 01:36:47.352
Roll-top desk.

01:36:47.552 --> 01:36:52.953
{y:i} My latest sun
{y:i} is sinking fast

01:36:52.753 --> 01:36:56.354
{y:i} My race is nearly run...

01:36:56.454 --> 01:36:59.155
"All's well that ends well",
some poet said.

01:36:59.355 --> 01:37:00.755
That's right, honey.

01:37:00.855 --> 01:37:03.056
I don't mind telling you
that I'm awful pleased

01:37:03.256 --> 01:37:05.856
my adventuring days
have come to an end.

01:37:06.056 --> 01:37:08.857
Time for this old boy
to enjoy some repose.

01:37:08.957 --> 01:37:10.457
That's good, honey.

01:37:10.557 --> 01:37:12.558
You were right about that ring, too.

01:37:12.758 --> 01:37:15.559
Any other wedding band wouldn't do.

01:37:15.759 --> 01:37:17.459
This here was fore-ordained.

01:37:17.659 --> 01:37:19.359
Fate was a-smilin' on me and you
just have to have confidence...

01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:21.260
That's not my ring.

01:37:21.460 --> 01:37:25.161
- What? Not your ring?
- That's one of Aunt Herlene's.

01:37:25.361 --> 01:37:28.161
- You said it was in the roll-top desk.
- I said I thought it was in the roll-top desk.

01:37:28.161 --> 01:37:30.662
- No, you said...
- Or under the mattress.

01:37:30.862 --> 01:37:32.562
- No...
- Or maybe in my chifforobe. I don't know.

01:37:32.762 --> 01:37:35.363
Well, I'm sorry, honey.

01:37:35.563 --> 01:37:36.863
We need that ring.

01:37:37.063 --> 01:37:39.464
Well, that ring is at the bottom
of a pretty darn big lake.

01:37:39.664 --> 01:37:41.765
- Uh-uh.
- A 9,000 hectare lake.

01:37:41.865 --> 01:37:45.465
I don't care if it's 90,000.
That lake was not my doing.

01:37:45.565 --> 01:37:48.666
- I've counted to three.
- No, wait, honey.

01:37:48.866 --> 01:37:51.767
Findin' one little ring
in the middle of all that water

01:37:51.767 --> 01:37:58.268
- is one hell of a heroic task!
{y:i} ...And gives me victory

01:37:58.268 --> 01:38:03.269
{y:i} O, come, angel band

01:38:03.369 --> 01:38:05.170
{y:i} Come and

01:38:05.370 --> 01:38:07.870
{y:i} Around me stand

01:38:07.970 --> 01:38:12.772
{y:i} O, bear me away
{y:i} on your snow white wings

01:38:12.872 --> 01:38:18.073
{y:i} To my immortal home

01:38:18.173 --> 01:38:23.274
{y:i} O, bear me away
{y:i} on your snow white wings

01:38:23.274 --> 01:38:30.776
{y:i} To my immortal home

01:38:36.577 --> 01:38:42.378
{y:i} My latest sun is sinking fast

01:38:42.478 --> 01:38:48.080
{y:i} My race is nearly run

01:38:47.980 --> 01:38:53.981
{y:i} My strongest trials now are past

01:38:53.981 --> 01:38:59.782
{y:i} My triumph has begun

01:38:59.982 --> 01:39:02.983
{y:i} O, come

01:39:03.083 --> 01:39:05.784
{y:i} Angel band

01:39:05.884 --> 01:39:11.085
{y:i} Come and around me stand

01:39:11.085 --> 01:39:16.486
{y:i} O, bear me away
{y:i} on your snow white wings

01:39:16.586 --> 01:39:22.187
{y:i} To my immortal home

01:39:22.287 --> 01:39:27.689
{y:i} O, bear me away
{y:i} on your snow white wings

01:39:27.589 --> 01:39:33.490
{y:i} To my immortal home

01:39:39.891 --> 01:39:45.793
{y:i} O, bear my longin' heart to him

01:39:45.793 --> 01:39:51.494
{y:i} Who bled and died for me

01:39:51.394 --> 01:39:57.295
{y:i} Whose blood
{y:i} now cleanses from all sin

01:39:57.395 --> 01:40:03.397
{y:i} And gives me victory

01:40:03.397 --> 01:40:06.097
{y:i} O, come

01:40:06.297 --> 01:40:08.898
{y:i} Angel band

01:40:08.998 --> 01:40:14.099
{y:i} Come and around me stand

01:40:14.099 --> 01:40:19.800
{y:i} O, bear me away
{y:i} on your snow white wings

01:40:19.700 --> 01:40:25.302
{y:i} To my immortal home

01:40:25.302 --> 01:40:30.903
{y:i} O, bear me away
{y:i} on your snow white wings

01:40:30.803 --> 01:40:40.605
{y:i} To my immortal home

01:40:56.309 --> 01:41:00.810
{y:i} There's a dark
{y:i} and a troubled side of life

01:41:00.810 --> 01:41:05.011
{y:i} There's a bright
{y:i} and a sunny side, too

01:41:05.111 --> 01:41:09.512
{y:i} Though we meet with
{y:i} darkness and strife

01:41:09.512 --> 01:41:14.013
{y:i} The sunny side be also with you

01:41:14.013 --> 01:41:15.913
{y:i} Keep on the sunny side

01:41:16.113 --> 01:41:17.914
{y:i} Always on the sunny side

01:41:18.114 --> 01:41:21.814
{y:i} Keep on the sunny side of life

01:41:21.914 --> 01:41:23.815
{y:i} It will help us every day

01:41:24.015 --> 01:41:26.015
{y:i} It will brighten all the way

01:41:26.215 --> 01:41:31.817
{y:i} If we'll keep on
{y:i} the sunny side of life

01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:51.621
{y:i} The storm and its fury
{y:i} broke today

01:41:51.621 --> 01:41:55.522
{y:i} Crushing hopes
{y:i} that we cherished so dear

01:41:55.522 --> 01:41:59.623
{y:i} Clouds and storms
{y:i} again will pass away

01:41:59.723 --> 01:42:04.524
{y:i} And the sun will shine again,
{y:i} bright and clear

01:42:04.524 --> 01:42:06.425
{y:i} Keep on the sunny side

01:42:06.625 --> 01:42:08.525
{y:i} Always on the sunny side

01:42:08.725 --> 01:42:12.426
{y:i} Keep on the sunny side of life

01:42:12.526 --> 01:42:14.326
{y:i} It will help us every day

01:42:14.526 --> 01:42:16.427
{y:i} It will brighten all the way

01:42:16.527 --> 01:42:21.328
{y:i} If we'll keep on
{y:i} the sunny side of life

01:42:21.328 --> 01:42:23.328
{y:i} Keep on the sunny side

01:42:23.528 --> 01:42:25.429
{y:i} Always on the sunny side

01:42:25.529 --> 01:42:29.130
{y:i} Keep on the sunny side of life

01:42:29.330 --> 01:42:31.330
{y:i} It will help us every day

01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:33.431
{y:i} It will brighten all the way

01:42:33.631 --> 01:42:37.832
{y:i} If we'll keep on
{y:i} the sunny side of life

01:42:37.832 --> 01:42:43.533
{y:i} If we'll keep on
{y:i} the sunny side of life
