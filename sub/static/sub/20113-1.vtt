00:21.448 --> 00:22.897
Welcome!

00:22.897 --> 00:24.663
Ladies and Gentlemen...!

00:24.755 --> 00:29.710
To the final round of the biannual
free fighting championship!

00:35.088 --> 00:39.025
Tonight we have a very special event.

00:39.652 --> 00:44.420
On one side, we have
Claire, "The Bull" Stronsom.

00:50.097 --> 00:51.569
On the other...!

00:52.251 --> 00:55.422
You've heard her name
echo through these walls.

00:56.028 --> 00:57.363
A myth!

00:57.695 --> 00:59.815
An urban legend!

00:59.880 --> 01:03.699
Right here!
Before your very own eyes!

01:03.699 --> 01:06.593
Bex "The Beast" Holt!

01:08.860 --> 01:10.333
No weapons...

01:11.182 --> 01:12.756
No dying.

01:14.000 --> 01:20.074

01:40.936 --> 01:42.879
Come on!
Knock her out!

02:38.491 --> 02:40.954
Hey!
Show me your hands, now!

02:41.026 --> 02:43.676
Hands up!
Now! Come on!

02:44.144 --> 02:45.836
Hands up!

02:57.755 --> 02:59.785
Buster, behave!

03:03.201 --> 03:04.829
Hey, Quincy!

03:05.488 --> 03:08.751
It's gonna be your lucky day today, 
buddy, what do you say?

03:11.803 --> 03:13.685
I know, I know...

03:13.777 --> 03:16.803
Hey, do you wanna know a little secret?

03:19.491 --> 03:21.801
You're my favorite dog of all.

03:23.661 --> 03:25.678
This is one of our favorites.

03:25.703 --> 03:27.145
Hey, sweetie!

03:27.807 --> 03:29.385
- Three legs?
- Yeah...

03:29.385 --> 03:30.376
How did that happen?

03:30.401 --> 03:32.511
He was in an accident
with his owner...

03:32.511 --> 03:33.516
Aw...

03:33.541 --> 03:34.710
What?

03:34.929 --> 03:36.905
Are you heroes or what?

03:37.091 --> 03:39.394
- Who is this little guy over here?
- Who?

03:39.501 --> 03:43.720
This guy is actually
another nice guy.

03:43.745 --> 03:45.875
He loves his belly rubs.

03:50.161 --> 03:52.197
- How old is he?
- Ahm, three?

03:52.222 --> 03:53.008
Yes.

04:04.043 --> 04:06.004
Becca, could you
lock up for the day?

04:06.029 --> 04:08.761
There's one more client with Randy
and that should be it for the day.

04:08.786 --> 04:11.195
Yeah, sure thing.

04:13.129 --> 04:14.877
Still daydreaming about that place?

04:14.877 --> 04:15.927
Sorry, I was...

04:15.927 --> 04:18.005
Some thing,
it's good to dream, hey...

04:18.005 --> 04:20.761
Do a good work around here 
and we'll help you in any way we can.

04:20.817 --> 04:22.922
- Thanks.
- All right.

04:23.201 --> 04:25.921
Sorry guys,
we're closed for the day.

04:26.079 --> 04:29.757
No worries, please...
We lost my dog.

04:31.102 --> 04:33.374
And we just came by to
see if it turned up.

04:33.374 --> 04:35.314
Please, I beg you,
it'll take two seconds...

04:35.314 --> 04:36.799
Two seconds,
two seconds.

04:36.799 --> 04:39.157
Well, let me check in the system.

04:46.661 --> 04:47.960
What breed is it?

04:47.960 --> 04:49.964
It's a brown and white pit-bull.

04:56.838 --> 04:59.403
No, we don't have anything
in the system, guys.

04:59.403 --> 05:00.840
Look again.

05:01.134 --> 05:04.221
I already looked, we don't have it,
we don't have the dog.

05:04.221 --> 05:06.365
Take your little fingers
and look again.

05:06.365 --> 05:08.097
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

05:08.097 --> 05:10.339
I'm gonna tell you one
more fucking time...

05:10.339 --> 05:12.147
Look for my
fucking dog.

05:12.147 --> 05:13.525
I need you to leave right now.

05:13.525 --> 05:15.907
Get me my dog!
Get me my dog!

05:15.907 --> 05:18.544
I'll kill every fucking dog in there!
Bring it!

05:18.544 --> 05:19.692
I got it.

05:20.180 --> 05:23.447
If you go past that door,
I'm gonna call he cops.

05:31.957 --> 05:35.494
Wait! You're not even going
the right way, just wait.

05:35.767 --> 05:39.641
Get the fuck off! What's wrong with you?
Are you a fucking stupid ass?

05:39.910 --> 05:41.482
Hey, asshole!

06:39.030 --> 06:42.609
Damn! You look good!

06:43.281 --> 06:44.649
How did you find me?

06:44.649 --> 06:48.368
Five million hits in less than a week?
That's pretty good!

06:50.171 --> 06:52.672
What?
Did you not wanna be found?

06:53.693 --> 06:55.160
Are you OK?

06:57.014 --> 06:59.783
That is the last thing I am right now.

07:00.510 --> 07:02.234
What happened?

07:03.640 --> 07:05.687
I owe money to some
very bad people.

07:05.687 --> 07:08.074
Of course you do... and?

07:08.074 --> 07:09.652
I'm not lying,
they'll fucking kill me...

07:09.652 --> 07:12.049
They'll fucking kill me
if I don't give them the money.

07:12.049 --> 07:14.736
- I'm serious, Becca.
- Really?

07:15.269 --> 07:16.886
How much?

07:17.570 --> 07:19.251
A hundred K.

07:20.211 --> 07:21.786
Even if I had that kind of cash,
I wouldn't...

07:21.786 --> 07:23.681
But you could have it.

07:30.046 --> 07:31.806
I'm not gonna fight.

07:31.921 --> 07:33.625
I'm not asking you to.

07:33.625 --> 07:36.342
Just help me win.
I've got a group of girls...

07:36.342 --> 07:37.678
No.

07:38.687 --> 07:40.768
The prize is 150 K.

07:40.780 --> 07:43.736
The girls and I agree,
100 for the debt,

07:43.915 --> 07:46.740
25 for you and we'll
just split the rest.

07:46.740 --> 07:48.923
Well, I don't want your money, Kate.

07:49.287 --> 07:51.411
What do you want then?

07:58.759 --> 08:01.059
Get the fuck out.

08:01.928 --> 08:04.424
I knew this was a waste of time.

08:11.750 --> 08:14.984
Yeah, she called in a couple of
days ago. She got me worried.

08:14.984 --> 08:18.425
Yeah, big surprise, Dad.

08:18.705 --> 08:22.203
Make your own decisions.
Just don't forget about the consequences.

08:22.401 --> 08:23.905
I don't wanna do it!

08:23.905 --> 08:27.119
I didn't wanna do it then, I don't
wanna do it now. I don't wanna do it!

08:27.172 --> 08:31.186
Yeah, neither did I wanna do it either,
but look, here we are.

08:31.219 --> 08:34.428
Do you expect us to be the fucking
Brady Bunch when you get out?

08:34.597 --> 08:37.453
Hold hands by the camp fire?
Sing Kum-Ba-Yah?

08:37.453 --> 08:40.360
No, I expect to see
my daughter still alive.

08:40.385 --> 08:42.687
But if you don't
help your sister,

08:42.687 --> 08:44.540
I might not get to.

08:52.741 --> 08:55.834
- I'll sleep on it.
- All right, sleep on it.

08:58.163 --> 08:59.779
I love you.

08:59.949 --> 09:01.553
I love you too.

09:09.319 --> 09:13.666
That's gonna be $3.200 for the flight.

09:13.872 --> 09:15.455
That's one way?

09:15.553 --> 09:20.846
Yes, that's one way.
Would you like to book for return?

09:23.449 --> 09:25.866
No, erm, no return.

09:27.082 --> 09:30.204
You know what?
Ahm, I'm gonna have to call back.

09:30.204 --> 09:33.868
- Thank you, though.
- OK, anything else I can help you with?

09:34.031 --> 09:37.281
- That's all.
- No problem. Have a good day.

09:38.521 --> 09:39.909
You too.

11:13.207 --> 11:15.627
Jeb, Jeb, right hand.

11:16.033 --> 11:18.335
Jeb, Jeb, right hand.

11:18.666 --> 11:20.319
You're slouching!
No slouch!

11:20.319 --> 11:24.228
On you, that's... Jeb, Jeb, right hand!
Good! Again!

11:24.268 --> 11:26.925
Jeb, Jeb, right hand!
Good!

11:28.355 --> 11:31.324
OK, OK, OK... take five.

11:31.324 --> 11:34.177
- I got you.
- Yeah, whatever.

11:36.161 --> 11:39.826
Don't tell me! It's that feeling
you get when you're in here.

11:39.905 --> 11:41.951
There's nothing
quite like it, right?

11:42.168 --> 11:43.557
Yeah, yeah...

11:44.652 --> 11:46.142
How you doing?

11:47.281 --> 11:50.784
I've seen better days but as long
as the engine keeps running...

11:53.928 --> 11:57.045
- Where have you been all these years?
- L.A.

11:57.348 --> 11:59.824
Aha! Chasing your dreams?

12:00.060 --> 12:02.345
Just trying to wash away all the filth.

12:02.925 --> 12:05.170
Why come back to the mud?

12:07.050 --> 12:08.982
I'm gonna train Kate.

12:09.374 --> 12:12.085
They're gonna drag you
back to that snake pit.

12:12.128 --> 12:14.056
You girls go there...

12:14.056 --> 12:17.541
Sooner or later,
you're going to get bit.

12:19.839 --> 12:21.622
Does your father know about this?

12:21.698 --> 12:23.392
Kate didn't leave us much of a choice.

12:23.407 --> 12:27.211
Hey, don't... you know what?
Don't say that. There's always a choice.

12:29.332 --> 12:31.246
Where is she?

12:34.282 --> 12:36.074
You really wanna know?

12:46.976 --> 12:49.836
Better the devil you know, I guess...

12:51.938 --> 12:54.274
You're still doing it wrong, you know?

13:15.039 --> 13:17.770
I'm not gonna ask you
why you're here.

13:18.040 --> 13:20.814
You're not gonna ask me to fight.

13:23.086 --> 13:25.590
I'll have to undo all your bad habits.

13:25.590 --> 13:27.908
Build you from the ground up.

13:29.113 --> 13:31.618
Guess we'll give it a whirl then, huh?

13:34.079 --> 13:37.282
- I've got other girls too.
- That's fine.

13:39.741 --> 13:42.261
You're not fucking with me, are you?

13:42.876 --> 13:45.046
There's still payment involved?

13:48.049 --> 13:49.366
Yes!

13:50.960 --> 13:53.355
Then, no,
I'm not fucking with you.

13:56.122 --> 13:58.362
You get out tomorrow, right?

13:59.344 --> 14:01.927
Oh, you're not going
to bail me out of here?

14:09.818 --> 14:12.907
- See you at three.
- Are you serious?

14:13.388 --> 14:14.718
Becca!

14:14.810 --> 14:16.619
Oh, come on!

14:17.179 --> 14:18.706
Becca?

14:22.337 --> 14:24.175
You're a cop?

14:30.608 --> 14:32.166
What the fuck?

14:32.521 --> 14:34.322
Where have you been all this time?

14:35.083 --> 14:36.932
I can take you for a coffee and explain?

14:36.932 --> 14:39.005
I already had a cup of coffee today.

14:39.045 --> 14:40.907
OK, erm...

14:42.376 --> 14:43.646
A beer?

14:43.683 --> 14:48.002
No, you can tell me whatever you got
to say to me right here, right now.

14:50.908 --> 14:53.320
You know? That's fine.
I don't really care.

14:53.320 --> 14:54.489
Just wait,
I can explain...

14:54.489 --> 14:55.935
Wait?

14:57.105 --> 14:59.551
It's been five years, Becca.

14:59.671 --> 15:01.723
Five years.

15:02.444 --> 15:05.284
I stopped waiting for you
a long time ago.

15:05.284 --> 15:07.458
Look, I'm sorry.
You have no idea what I went through.

15:07.458 --> 15:09.995
Don't you think it's
a little bit late for that?

15:14.216 --> 15:16.882
Excuse me, I've got work to do.

15:35.170 --> 15:36.900
You're ready?

15:37.462 --> 15:38.895
You're late!

15:40.482 --> 15:42.883
Yeah, well, I had an
emergency at home.

15:42.883 --> 15:45.087
Yeah, yeah, dog ate
your homework?

15:45.111 --> 15:46.887
This place's changed a bit.

15:46.887 --> 15:49.673
This place runs an import-export
company for the most part.

15:49.698 --> 15:51.693
The real money is in the fights.

15:51.718 --> 15:52.877
Holt...?

15:53.423 --> 15:54.630
What is this?

15:54.630 --> 15:58.065
Just bringing by some new customers.
Back off.

15:58.389 --> 16:00.539
Does Landon know about it?

16:01.894 --> 16:05.018
She's got money...
Isn't that what matters?

16:12.055 --> 16:13.502
Girlfriend of yours?

16:13.502 --> 16:16.754
She's just a guard dog...
All bark and no bite.

16:16.890 --> 16:21.597
Seems like a lot of trouble to be
betting on illegal fights in Sin City.

16:21.606 --> 16:25.317
No, we got a lot of little depo junkies
that can't bet on the big shows.

16:25.360 --> 16:28.168
Sounds like a
shitty Comfort version.

16:28.193 --> 16:29.985
Anything high stakes?

16:29.985 --> 16:32.798
Oh, we get a couple of high
rollers that come in here.

16:32.884 --> 16:34.750
Why would the come here?

16:34.775 --> 16:36.831
They burnt too many bridges.
This place is a nest

16:36.831 --> 16:38.541
for all kinds of
illegal activity.

16:38.541 --> 16:40.292
Dog fights, cock fights...

16:40.292 --> 16:43.801
Most people come here to watch two
women beat the shit out of each other.

16:45.283 --> 16:46.875
Lovely.

16:54.019 --> 16:56.535
Hey, Sal, you got the door?

17:51.309 --> 17:54.401
"Bull" wins again, ladies and gentlemen,
thank you...

17:54.401 --> 17:57.551
for your bets. Collect your winnings
at the register on your way out.

17:57.551 --> 18:01.551
And may we see you
and your green paper again soon.

18:02.160 --> 18:03.377
Hey!

18:03.958 --> 18:07.575
You don't fight today, do you?
I didn't see you in the entries.

18:07.575 --> 18:10.213
No, just being a tour guide.

18:10.386 --> 18:12.663
Hmm... welcome then.

18:12.663 --> 18:13.838
How may I be of service?

18:13.838 --> 18:16.529
Slow down, guv'nor...
she's off limits.

18:16.554 --> 18:19.897
Yeah, I've heard that before.
My name's Micah.

18:20.463 --> 18:22.069
Becca.

18:23.110 --> 18:24.674
You have beautiful eyes.

18:24.745 --> 18:27.663
Have you seen them lately?
They're great.

18:29.624 --> 18:32.957
Anyway, I should be back to work...
before I'm made redundant.

18:32.982 --> 18:34.219
Cheers.

18:35.969 --> 18:37.504
A friend?

18:37.564 --> 18:40.118
Yeah, he's a good guy.

18:40.143 --> 18:42.732
He makes sure we don't break any rules.

18:43.395 --> 18:44.913
Which are...?

18:44.913 --> 18:47.198
No weapons.
No dying.

18:48.128 --> 18:50.106
You mean "killing"?

18:50.131 --> 18:54.600
No, Jones makes it clear from the start,
if you die, it's on you.

18:54.801 --> 18:55.954
Jones?

18:55.954 --> 18:58.648
Yeah, it's his joint.

18:58.648 --> 19:00.543
He used to be a fight
promoter until he got banned

19:00.543 --> 19:03.045
by the Commission for
illegal betting.

19:05.520 --> 19:07.687
He runs a lot of stuff out of here...

19:07.763 --> 19:10.126
But he started Pit Nights
to give fighters a home.

19:10.264 --> 19:12.656
A chance to earn some extra cash.

19:13.001 --> 19:16.423
Yeah, I'm sure he's
quite the philanthropist.

19:20.695 --> 19:22.921
He's the guy you owe money to?

19:27.248 --> 19:29.425
What about the cops?

19:30.565 --> 19:33.526
That's the Chief of police right there.

19:38.052 --> 19:40.229
Welcome home, Becca.

19:44.429 --> 19:45.596
Hey!

19:54.306 --> 19:57.273
Katy, babe!
You're out!

19:57.273 --> 20:01.842
And you brought mama a
fresh piece of meat from the snabber.

20:01.842 --> 20:04.600
- Becca, meet Winter.
- Why Winter?

20:04.600 --> 20:07.315
'Cos I knock bitches out cold!

20:08.997 --> 20:10.060
Good.

20:14.206 --> 20:16.097
This is Lisa Nu Wing...

20:16.097 --> 20:19.363
She's our sexy Vietnamese ringleader.

20:19.753 --> 20:22.135
She's got as mid-ass kick too.

20:22.315 --> 20:25.408
And this over here is little Gaby.

20:25.440 --> 20:28.137
Little, feisty Gaby.

20:30.313 --> 20:32.103
What do you think?

20:33.838 --> 20:35.615
Can they fight?

20:42.169 --> 20:43.889
Let's go, Barbie.

20:43.902 --> 20:45.788
She's so pretty, right?

20:52.401 --> 20:53.962
You ready?

21:00.616 --> 21:02.131
Let's go!

21:02.887 --> 21:04.733
Let's do this.

21:43.372 --> 21:45.133
You suck!

21:51.662 --> 21:54.774
Too many quesadillas, puta.

21:54.907 --> 21:56.866
Why don't you come in here
and see what you can do?

21:56.866 --> 21:59.725
Shit!
 I thought you'd never ask!

22:07.470 --> 22:09.354
Fuck you.

22:14.686 --> 22:16.810
All right, Lisa,
you got this.

22:24.510 --> 22:26.449
Come on, you got this.

22:32.824 --> 22:35.089
- Shake it up!
- Come on, come on!

22:41.535 --> 22:43.893
- You're in the corner!
- Get out of there!

22:54.672 --> 22:58.340
You're flat-footed. You'll never
generate enough power like that.

22:58.371 --> 23:02.467
Your technique is sloppy
and she sacrifices power for speed.

23:02.467 --> 23:05.981
Kate, put a muzzle on this bitch
before I break her face.

23:05.981 --> 23:08.599
You are aware you have to make
contact to do that, right?

23:08.599 --> 23:11.039
Are you gonna tell us
who your mystery girl is, huh?

23:11.039 --> 23:12.745
She's your new trainer.

23:12.873 --> 23:14.718
She's Bex Holt.

23:15.565 --> 23:18.943
- You're Bex?
- Who the fuck is Bex?

23:18.943 --> 23:21.881
She used to fight in "The Brew"
back in the day. You're "Bex Beast".

23:21.881 --> 23:24.719
But she isn't,
she's a dog-whisperer now, huh?

23:24.719 --> 23:25.899
Right?

23:29.351 --> 23:31.331
See you guys tomorrow.

23:44.193 --> 23:46.762
So, you wanna come over
for dinner tonight?

23:48.651 --> 23:50.949
No, I got other plans.

23:51.015 --> 23:52.396
Really?

24:06.893 --> 24:10.234
Becca?
What the hell are you doing?

24:10.550 --> 24:11.875
Sleeping?

24:11.875 --> 24:14.395
Aren't you real smart?
In an open car like this.

24:14.395 --> 24:17.001
Grab you bag, I'm gonna
drive you to the gym.

24:17.001 --> 24:21.267
OK, just stop pointing that
flashlight on my face.

24:22.197 --> 24:23.956
Let me get that for you.

24:23.956 --> 24:25.401
Thanks.

24:25.924 --> 24:28.739
How long have you been doing
this security gig for?

24:29.035 --> 24:31.144
Since you Dad went to prison.

24:31.221 --> 24:33.598
You know,
this place is a money pit.

24:33.806 --> 24:36.418
I gotta do this task
just to keep it going.

24:37.594 --> 24:39.823
Sam better make good
on getting out,

24:39.823 --> 24:43.088
because I can't swing
this record much longer.

24:44.175 --> 24:46.456
Anyway, the room's a little small...

24:46.456 --> 24:49.291
I use it sometimes when
I'm too beat-up to go home but...

24:49.291 --> 24:51.086
I'm sure it'll be fine.

24:51.619 --> 24:53.440
It's great.

24:56.793 --> 24:58.299
What happened there?

24:58.504 --> 24:59.982
Oh, that?

25:00.035 --> 25:02.001
I used to have a fighting
fish in there...

25:02.001 --> 25:05.297
Until my ex-wife took one of my
trophies and threw it at him.

25:05.322 --> 25:08.884
Well, she actually threw it at me
but I ducked and...

25:09.252 --> 25:10.996
That's what happened.

25:11.469 --> 25:12.841
She sounds lovely.

25:12.841 --> 25:14.542
Yeah, she was lovely.

25:14.736 --> 25:17.816
In fact, I never realized what
a good house-keeper she was.

25:17.841 --> 25:20.944
We got divorced,
she kept the house!

25:23.486 --> 25:26.122
Look, I gotta tell you something.

25:26.352 --> 25:28.635
I need to get it off my chest.

25:29.070 --> 25:31.689
I still can't believe
your Dad killed those kids.

25:31.689 --> 25:34.085
Even after what they did to Kate.

25:36.411 --> 25:37.503
Why not?

25:37.509 --> 25:40.860
Your Dad and I have known each other
since we were seven years old.

25:40.860 --> 25:42.804
We used to chase girls together.

25:42.804 --> 25:44.978
We drank our first beer together.

25:45.129 --> 25:47.548
We even built this place together.

25:47.548 --> 25:50.881
And I've seen him go through
some tough shit in his life.

25:51.095 --> 25:54.677
But he was always a kind person.

25:54.890 --> 25:58.929
I just never thought
it was in his nature.

26:01.391 --> 26:04.941
All right, all right,
all right, come on... Circle up.

26:11.828 --> 26:13.817
Fighting in its purest form

26:13.817 --> 26:16.377
is about subduing your opponent
without actually fighting.

26:16.484 --> 26:19.370
First class and you hand us
some shitty paradox?

26:19.370 --> 26:21.043
What are we supposed
to do with that?

26:21.051 --> 26:23.475
It's an impossibility in most cases,

26:23.475 --> 26:26.799
but the closer you are to that form,

26:26.799 --> 26:29.699
the easier it is
to defeat your opponent.

26:31.218 --> 26:33.780
What's the most important quality
a fighter should have?

26:33.780 --> 26:34.859
- Strength!
- Speed!

26:34.859 --> 26:37.054
- Come on. - No.
- You're wrong.  - I told you.

26:37.054 --> 26:39.702
- Brains.
- Yes.

26:43.944 --> 26:47.106
You can be strong,
you can be fast, but...

26:47.318 --> 26:50.376
If you're not smart about
how you fight...

26:51.776 --> 26:53.719
None of it matters.

26:53.839 --> 26:55.107
Excuse me!

26:55.107 --> 26:56.654
Teacher, a question.

26:56.654 --> 27:00.539
Are we gonna get going?
Or is this a theory class?

27:04.496 --> 27:06.264
OK, spring roll.

27:15.172 --> 27:17.936
Think about it.
I already know you're coming fast.

27:17.936 --> 27:21.607
You already know I'm faster than you so,
what do you do?

27:22.508 --> 27:25.834
Plant your feet.
Speed is not your friend here.

27:32.749 --> 27:35.631
You gotta stop beating
that orange chicken.

27:36.599 --> 27:39.580
You went for the face
and sacrificed your footing.

27:40.258 --> 27:41.794
Again!

27:42.178 --> 27:44.092
All right, Morpheus.

27:46.218 --> 27:47.991
Last try.

27:56.804 --> 27:58.821
In your face!

27:58.821 --> 28:00.153
Good!

28:00.523 --> 28:01.942
Next?

28:09.450 --> 28:11.630
I was a bit harsh the other night.

28:14.319 --> 28:17.844
- What?
- I was a bit harsh the other night.

28:20.325 --> 28:21.776
An apology?

28:21.776 --> 28:25.998
No, I think I'm entitled to my reaction.

28:27.091 --> 28:31.770
I'm just reconsidering your request.

28:34.792 --> 28:36.538
I'm sorry for everything.

28:36.538 --> 28:39.399
I'm sorry for not calling,
I'm sorry for not coming back, I'm...

28:39.643 --> 28:42.139
What do you want me to say?
I'm sorry.

28:42.924 --> 28:47.293
After what happened to Kate and Dad,
I didn't know up from down.

28:48.806 --> 28:50.782
Why did you come back?

28:52.099 --> 28:54.790
I'm helping Kate with some...

28:54.873 --> 28:56.547
personal issues.

28:59.441 --> 29:01.170
Where's the uniform?

29:01.462 --> 29:04.284
Hmm.
I'm off duty.

29:04.284 --> 29:07.066
- When did that happen?
- About two hours ago.

29:07.091 --> 29:08.994
No, your badge.

29:10.133 --> 29:11.776
Three years ago.

29:12.392 --> 29:16.779
I got fired from the track.
Decided to join the Force.

29:17.076 --> 29:20.480
Decent pay, benefits, a future.

29:24.412 --> 29:26.096
Where are you staying?

29:27.387 --> 29:29.154
At the gym.

29:29.574 --> 29:32.504
- Just up the street.
- I know where it is.

29:35.136 --> 29:39.644
You know, I actually,
I should really get going.

29:40.124 --> 29:43.142
Try not to go Houdini on me again.

29:47.138 --> 29:49.513
You've gotta be smart
about how you fight.

29:49.561 --> 29:52.211
And how you fight depends
on who you fight.

29:52.242 --> 29:53.858
What do you see here?

29:53.920 --> 29:55.417
Existential torment?

29:55.417 --> 29:57.792
Why don't you come
give it a spin, Socrates?

29:57.792 --> 30:00.850
It's Nietzsche to be precise,
but you wouldn't know that, right?

30:00.850 --> 30:02.574
- Why don't you try to hit me, little shit?
- Don't mind if I do.

30:02.574 --> 30:04.598
- See if I can even feel it.
- OK.

30:04.598 --> 30:08.145
Off of Zeke's point,
just like him, the Bull's thick.

30:09.562 --> 30:11.911
- But it's all muscle.
- She's a big bitch, for sure!

30:11.911 --> 30:13.862
You're a big bitch for sure!

30:13.862 --> 30:16.761
Yeah, but I flow
like a butterfly!

30:17.499 --> 30:20.403
You got it, now you see me,
now you don't!

30:22.639 --> 30:24.720
Muscle acts like armor,

30:24.745 --> 30:27.499
the more you have,
the more protected you are.

30:27.700 --> 30:31.996
So, there's no point
attacking here... here.

30:33.324 --> 30:34.888
Or there.

30:36.669 --> 30:39.625
- Can I hit back?
- Would love it if you did.

30:41.082 --> 30:45.580
So, we're gonna learn how to manipulate
the joints through technique.

30:45.605 --> 30:48.478
And attack where
there's no muscle. Right?

30:49.349 --> 30:50.588
Come on.

30:51.299 --> 30:54.059
Elbows, wrist, knees.

30:54.059 --> 30:57.656
It's not about size and strength,
it's about technique.

30:57.727 --> 31:00.860
I think we all get the point, Becca.
We get the point.

31:02.364 --> 31:04.047
What about the throat?

31:04.134 --> 31:06.152
It's a dangerous spot, Kate.

31:06.152 --> 31:09.176
- Yeah, but lay everyone out.
- Or kill them.

31:09.518 --> 31:13.465
OK. Just break in case
of emergency then, OK?

31:15.005 --> 31:18.358
So, who's up first?

31:20.824 --> 31:23.591
Hey, hey, one at a time,
one at a time.

31:25.300 --> 31:27.231
Got any dinner plans?

31:27.433 --> 31:28.586
No.

31:29.971 --> 31:33.784
I think that maybe you could come by...
See my place?

31:33.810 --> 31:37.504
I'm exhausted, Kate.
Maybe another time.

31:37.854 --> 31:39.419
Come on, man,
I'm trying.

31:39.419 --> 31:41.679
You're never gonna stop asking, are you?

31:44.027 --> 31:45.696
Is that a yes?

31:48.575 --> 31:50.512
You own this place?

31:51.166 --> 31:52.598
I rent.

31:52.776 --> 31:55.525
- Mummy!
- Hey!

31:56.601 --> 31:58.775
Hi, Kate! Sorry the place
is kind of a mess,

31:58.775 --> 32:02.481
we were playing indoor tag-mat,
got completely out of control.

32:02.506 --> 32:04.110
Thank you... wow.

32:04.454 --> 32:06.655
Thank you so much for getting her.

32:06.809 --> 32:09.361
This is my sister, Becca.

32:09.467 --> 32:12.467
Oh, hi! 
I've heard so much about you.

32:13.301 --> 32:15.216
All good things, of course.

32:15.301 --> 32:17.362
You've a beautiful family.

32:17.437 --> 32:18.996
Thanks.

32:19.997 --> 32:23.308
OK, well, I will let you...

32:23.308 --> 32:26.158
Oh, yeah, sorry, I've got, mhm...

32:26.158 --> 32:28.504
Here we go.
Do you wanna give it to her?

32:29.561 --> 32:31.158
Thank you.

32:31.803 --> 32:34.277
Bye, ahm, it's nice to meet you.

32:35.622 --> 32:39.369
Lily, I want you
to meet someone.

32:39.501 --> 32:41.607
This is your Aunt Becca.

32:43.421 --> 32:46.027
Don't hide... hey.

32:46.508 --> 32:48.319
What do we say when we meet someone?

32:48.319 --> 32:49.854
Nice to meet you.

32:49.854 --> 32:51.948
Right! 
Will you say it to her, please?

32:51.948 --> 32:53.696
Nice to meet you.

32:57.686 --> 32:59.380
- Hi, Lily.

33:00.594 --> 33:03.543
- How old are you?
- Five.

33:06.392 --> 33:11.467
- Hey, why don't you go clean your
room for Aunt Becca, OK? - OK. - OK.

33:20.018 --> 33:23.730
So... a whole mess in here.

33:38.978 --> 33:42.058
So, this guy you owe money to...
Jones.

33:42.555 --> 33:44.511
What about him?

33:45.162 --> 33:47.251
How well do you know him?

33:47.506 --> 33:49.275
Well enough.

33:49.870 --> 33:52.786
He's a business man,
ruthless...

33:52.786 --> 33:55.545
One of those not-to-be-fucked-with
kind of guys.

33:58.048 --> 34:02.309
How ruthless?
Can you be a bit more specific?

34:04.689 --> 34:06.724
A couple of months ago,

34:06.903 --> 34:09.476
these two guys 
showed up at the Pit.

34:09.632 --> 34:11.934
Just coming fresh of a hot streak.

34:12.416 --> 34:14.614
Fifty grand buy-in.

34:15.185 --> 34:17.956
And they bet it all on this first-timer.

34:18.246 --> 34:19.592
She didn't stand a chance.

34:19.592 --> 34:22.842
She was up against one of the
toughest chicks in the entire circle.

34:23.079 --> 34:25.527
And yet, she won.

34:26.071 --> 34:28.960
- Four hundred grand pay-out.
- Jesus!

34:29.284 --> 34:30.255
Yap.

34:30.445 --> 34:34.396
The problem came when Jones found out
the whole thing was staged.

34:42.946 --> 34:47.830
Both fighters were in on it
and a hundred grand each.

34:49.536 --> 34:50.824
Why?

34:51.235 --> 34:53.831
Because I needed the money
for medical bills.

34:53.831 --> 34:57.634
What's wrong with you, Kate? Hmm?
What's so wrong with you?

34:57.853 --> 34:59.678
I'm done, mum.

35:00.404 --> 35:02.474
Lay back,
you're ready?

35:02.659 --> 35:04.409
Can Aunt Becca do it?

35:04.547 --> 35:07.750
Of course, sweetie.
You can show her how.

35:11.384 --> 35:13.199
Open it.

35:18.535 --> 35:22.051
So, put that in there,

35:22.051 --> 35:25.543
and then push that
and then put it to three,

35:25.543 --> 35:28.004
and then I'll get all better.

35:28.047 --> 35:30.912
Push that thing
and put that right there.

35:32.264 --> 35:34.861
- Then turn it to three.
- Ready?

35:36.292 --> 35:38.300
Push that thing.

35:42.957 --> 35:45.866
- All better?
- A-ha! Mummy?

35:46.008 --> 35:50.994
Oh, honey, there...
why don't you go show me your room, huh?

35:51.483 --> 35:53.118
Come here.

36:28.497 --> 36:30.324
Excuse me.

36:39.450 --> 36:41.559
Are you planning on building something?

36:42.617 --> 36:45.954
Thinking about it.
A house, maybe?

36:46.411 --> 36:47.652
Hmm.

36:47.916 --> 36:49.719
In France?

36:50.429 --> 36:55.896
Oh, no... I wanna go to Africa,
the part where they speak French.

36:59.756 --> 37:01.994
Pourquoi l'Afrique?

37:03.674 --> 37:05.286
Pourquoi pas?

37:06.989 --> 37:08.921
Oui... Pourquoi pas.

37:09.770 --> 37:12.473
I guess a little adventure is good
when you're young.

37:15.480 --> 37:17.301
How about you?

37:20.922 --> 37:23.723
It's a little hobby of mine. I...

37:24.786 --> 37:27.337
I build bird houses on my spare time.

37:28.402 --> 37:29.702
Hmm...

37:30.045 --> 37:32.941
- How many have you built?
- Phew...

37:33.461 --> 37:34.877
Hundreds.

37:35.012 --> 37:36.728
- Wow.
- Hmm.

37:37.364 --> 37:38.662
Do you sell them?

37:38.662 --> 37:43.615
No, no, it's more of a therapeutic type
of thing I do... helps me to relax.

37:43.640 --> 37:46.011
- Have you tried a stress ball?
- Hmm.

37:46.234 --> 37:48.669
Stress ball, Zen garden...

37:48.867 --> 37:50.549
I've tried it all...

37:50.601 --> 37:54.608
But there's nothing
like building a house...

37:54.633 --> 37:59.965
Where animals can come, take shelter,
eat, procreate...

38:00.525 --> 38:02.981
It helps just to make
things right in my world.

38:03.221 --> 38:05.332
Must be a hell of a world.

38:05.332 --> 38:08.211
Hell's got nothing on this,
mademoiselle.

38:10.035 --> 38:13.666
Well, good luck with
everything, Mister...?

38:13.691 --> 38:16.927
Je m'appelle Landon. Et vous?

38:17.959 --> 38:20.203
Je m'appelle Rebecca.

38:22.759 --> 38:24.466
Enchanté.

38:26.139 --> 38:28.204
You got strong hands.

38:28.432 --> 38:30.940
Builder's hands.

38:31.239 --> 38:32.662
Merci.

38:34.257 --> 38:37.674
Au revoir!
Petit oiseau.

38:51.419 --> 38:54.406
- Yo, Becca!

38:54.980 --> 38:56.332
Hey.

38:57.205 --> 39:00.311
So, I've been doing some digging,

39:00.311 --> 39:04.213
and a friend of mine told me about
her first time at a bin night fight.

39:05.765 --> 39:11.044
She said she bet on this
huge Goliath-looking girl,

39:11.044 --> 39:14.017
who was fighting a scrawny newbie.

39:14.128 --> 39:15.161
So, check this,

39:15.161 --> 39:19.193
not only does this tiny ass bunny
beat the Goliath...

39:19.459 --> 39:21.194
but when the house
wouldn't pay her,

39:21.194 --> 39:24.138
she took out the two
bouncers at the joint!

39:24.445 --> 39:27.150
She said as she was
walking out to the Brewery,

39:27.206 --> 39:29.972
all she could hear was
the crowd chanting:

39:29.972 --> 39:35.192
"Bex, Bex, Bex!"

39:35.812 --> 39:39.404
- Sound familiar?
- A nice story.

39:40.816 --> 39:44.747
Why don't you go rest up? Maybe someone
will be chanting your name tonight, huh?

39:45.003 --> 39:48.393
All right.
I see how it is.

39:49.422 --> 39:54.795
This conversation is not over...
Bexy Bex.

39:54.795 --> 39:56.111
OK.

40:06.615 --> 40:10.770
Did she say two bouncers?
I remember three!

40:19.716 --> 40:23.999
- You're going to the Pit, right?
- What would you have me do?

40:24.007 --> 40:28.197
The both of you should just go.
Take Lily and leave!

40:33.735 --> 40:35.714
It's just a fight.

40:35.714 --> 40:37.668
What's the worst that can happen?

40:37.668 --> 40:40.043
She loses... she's dead anyways.

40:40.043 --> 40:44.402
You're wrong!
Far worst things can happen.

40:45.444 --> 40:47.821
I expect to see my
daughter still alive,

40:47.821 --> 40:50.216
but if you don't
help your sister,

40:50.216 --> 40:51.824
I might not get to.

40:58.023 --> 40:59.992
Ladies and Gentlemen,

40:59.992 --> 41:06.080
welcome to the qualifying round
of the Free Fight Championship!

41:07.008 --> 41:09.170
That's right, bitches.
Come on!

41:11.341 --> 41:15.488
You know the game,
you know the rules.

41:15.957 --> 41:20.251
The challenger that wins,
advances to the next round.

41:20.338 --> 41:22.182
No weapons...

41:22.778 --> 41:24.417
No dying.

41:24.954 --> 41:27.650
Gaby, remember what I told you
and you'll be just fine.

41:27.650 --> 41:30.124
One punch to the throat.

41:35.309 --> 41:37.449
Mademoiselle Rebecca...

41:38.383 --> 41:40.363
Fancy seeing you here.

41:40.363 --> 41:41.669
Yeah.

41:43.753 --> 41:46.435
How's the French coming along?

41:46.526 --> 41:49.582
Good. 
How are the bird houses?

41:49.913 --> 41:51.727
Spectacular.

41:52.304 --> 41:54.405
Would you like to take a look?

41:55.937 --> 41:58.107
The fights are gonna start.

41:58.712 --> 42:01.935
Hmm,  hmm...
No, they won't start without me.

42:02.219 --> 42:04.026
I own the place.

42:06.952 --> 42:08.673
Shall we?

42:10.854 --> 42:12.875
It's right this way.

42:17.088 --> 42:19.680
Claire, sunshine...

42:19.999 --> 42:23.091
Would you be so kind
and give us the room, please?

42:24.002 --> 42:25.651
Everything all right?

42:25.651 --> 42:27.459
Spectacular.

42:27.677 --> 42:31.677
I'm just showing our new friend here
what I've built.

42:52.527 --> 42:54.794
I'll be right outside.

42:58.100 --> 42:59.906
Awkward.

43:02.396 --> 43:05.280
She likes to mark her territory.

43:06.470 --> 43:08.710
She's very loyal, that one.

43:09.108 --> 43:11.248
She's a part of my family now.

43:11.910 --> 43:15.789
Family means so much to me.

43:16.333 --> 43:19.466
Yeah... speaking of family...

43:22.173 --> 43:25.333
The Jones family crest,
Celtic in origin.

43:25.333 --> 43:26.436
Impressive!

43:26.436 --> 43:27.904
Merci.

43:30.990 --> 43:33.981
I come from a long line of...

43:34.095 --> 43:37.171
degenerate drinkers and gamblers.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.968
But that's my family.

43:41.323 --> 43:42.898
You can't choose your family.

43:42.898 --> 43:46.109
You take the good with the bad.

43:48.102 --> 43:49.916
Do you gamble much?

43:50.345 --> 43:52.059
From time to time.

43:52.084 --> 43:58.860
I don't. 
I lean more towards secure investments.

43:59.477 --> 44:01.625
Guaranteed pay-outs.

44:01.670 --> 44:03.372
Is there such a thing?

44:03.372 --> 44:05.202
Oui. Yes. Of course!

44:05.202 --> 44:08.249
One just has to look
for the right opportunity.

44:08.249 --> 44:12.388
The right amount of risk
versus the right amount of incentive,

44:12.388 --> 44:17.037
can equal a guaranteed
return on an investment.

44:17.937 --> 44:20.334
Although there are times where
the variables don't add up,

44:20.334 --> 44:25.358
and usually someone has tampered
with another wise, good formula.

44:28.626 --> 44:31.083
I wanna show you something.

44:31.525 --> 44:33.858
By the way, 
who are you betting on tonight?

44:33.965 --> 44:38.786
Wait, don't tell me, don't tell me
'cos I already know.

44:41.147 --> 44:43.285
Would you like an ice-cream?

44:44.032 --> 44:45.495
No, thanks.

44:45.495 --> 44:48.351
I've got lots of flavors.

44:51.191 --> 44:52.925
Ooops.

44:55.120 --> 44:58.244
I put Kate's old friends in time-out.

45:00.642 --> 45:03.107
Excuse me...

45:04.933 --> 45:06.305
Hmmm.

45:15.637 --> 45:17.679
They took my ice-cream...

45:17.715 --> 45:19.860
without my permission.

45:21.346 --> 45:23.976
So I had to set them free.

45:25.156 --> 45:29.909
Do you think Kate or
any of her new friends...

45:30.949 --> 45:33.345
have a chance at winning?

45:35.775 --> 45:39.852
'Cos if none of them win,
where's the guarantee?

45:40.709 --> 45:42.927
Who's gonna pay me back?

45:45.710 --> 45:48.126
[INDISTINCT]

45:51.292 --> 45:55.531
We inherit the problems,
these are our issues now.

45:58.431 --> 46:00.485
I like Kate...

46:00.919 --> 46:03.169
but she's not very...

46:04.382 --> 46:06.932
How do you say...?
Smart.

46:09.175 --> 46:11.390
What I do like...

46:11.415 --> 46:13.444
Your father.

46:13.469 --> 46:21.057
Ah, there's a man who's willing to
sacrifice himself to protect the flock.

46:22.398 --> 46:24.249
Admirable.

46:27.906 --> 46:30.013
Little Kate, erm...

46:31.007 --> 46:33.615
She's not a part of my family.

46:37.223 --> 46:39.428
When it's done,

46:39.973 --> 46:42.355
the debt is paid.

46:43.825 --> 46:48.247
Don't come near her or our family again.

46:51.736 --> 46:53.632
Got it?

46:55.008 --> 46:57.280
Yes, I got it!

47:01.352 --> 47:03.884
Welcome back...

47:04.556 --> 47:06.222
Bex.

47:09.450 --> 47:11.351
Baby-face.

47:12.426 --> 47:15.499
Rip her up,
rip her up, you got it!

47:17.545 --> 47:19.256
You fuck her up.

47:27.988 --> 47:29.622
Take your time.

47:34.567 --> 47:36.894
Get up! Get out of there!
Get up!

47:37.810 --> 47:39.593
Hit the floor!

47:39.648 --> 47:40.593
Break it!

47:40.593 --> 47:42.166
Tap, Winter, tap!

47:42.191 --> 47:43.286
Break it!

47:43.286 --> 47:46.023
She's gonna break her arm,
tap it out!

47:46.061 --> 47:47.794
Winter, tap!

47:55.806 --> 48:00.061
Piece of shit.
I swear Ima get up and fuck you up.

48:04.466 --> 48:07.846
That's it, baby.
You did it for Papa, baby.

48:15.186 --> 48:17.320
Oh, no, you're good,
you're good.

48:17.664 --> 48:18.662
You're good.

48:18.691 --> 48:21.536
But if you're gonna do it,
you might as well do it right.

48:22.498 --> 48:23.910
Grab one more...

48:24.180 --> 48:25.318
Come on!

48:31.776 --> 48:33.695
That felt good.

48:40.373 --> 48:41.637
Yeah!

48:42.539 --> 48:44.370
I got a lot of money riding on this.

48:44.370 --> 48:45.550
Good!

49:32.402 --> 49:34.821
Hmmm...
two more chances.

50:03.837 --> 50:05.117
Yeah!

50:05.188 --> 50:07.764
That's what I'm talking about!

50:27.975 --> 50:29.955
Come on, get her!
Come on!

50:52.841 --> 50:55.240
- OK, let me help you.
- Yeah.

51:05.407 --> 51:08.072
And now we're down to one.

51:08.097 --> 51:12.109
Wakie, wakie!
Come on, Gaby, baby, breathe...

51:14.991 --> 51:17.312
What are you doing?

51:17.956 --> 51:20.053
You smell lovely.

51:23.708 --> 51:26.935
- I won, right?
- Of course, you did!

51:27.022 --> 51:31.215
Bitches are lined up outside
so you can sign their titties... look...

51:32.257 --> 51:35.532
Yo all, come on, let's go,
I need a drink, for real.

51:35.532 --> 51:37.746
- She ought to rest.
- Come on.

51:38.762 --> 51:40.446
Come with us.

51:40.809 --> 51:44.165
I'm not going and neither should you.

51:44.165 --> 51:47.020
Becca, the fight is in two days.
I think I can handle one drink...

51:47.020 --> 51:51.602
Are you listening to yourself?
You're the last one, you're it.

51:51.602 --> 51:55.427
If you lose,
how are you gonna pay this guy back?

52:00.333 --> 52:02.234
I can't do this.

52:02.382 --> 52:03.668
Hey!

52:04.499 --> 52:07.310
I have a bad feeling about this.

52:07.335 --> 52:09.476
It's gonna be fine!

52:10.282 --> 52:12.352
Look, I know I've been a fuck-up...

52:12.549 --> 52:15.074
That's not who I am anymore!

52:16.044 --> 52:18.330
Kiss and make up already!

52:21.531 --> 52:23.085
Come with us.

52:25.041 --> 52:27.092
I'll see you tomorrow.

52:33.323 --> 52:36.252
Come on, Kate!
Let's go get some poison tonight!

52:36.573 --> 52:39.130
- Get up!
- I'll give you some poison!

52:41.475 --> 52:44.013
You want a piece of this, fuckface?

52:45.585 --> 52:47.335
Yes, please.

52:49.783 --> 52:51.639
Calm down.

52:53.256 --> 52:55.481
- We'll get some tequila...
- Wow!

52:57.078 --> 53:00.046
- All right, OK.
- I'm cool. - Woooow!

53:30.191 --> 53:31.769
Who is it?

53:31.769 --> 53:33.593
Hey, it's Potter.

53:35.151 --> 53:36.828
Hold on.

53:44.346 --> 53:46.997
It's stuck!
Come down here!

53:50.184 --> 53:52.280
- Hey!
- Hey!

53:52.551 --> 53:55.404
I'm not interrupting
anything in here, am I?

53:55.957 --> 53:58.735
No, I was hitting the bags.

53:59.420 --> 54:02.801
I see... 
D'you work up an appetite?

54:02.953 --> 54:05.251
I was gonna order from Joey's.

54:10.649 --> 54:11.809
OK.

54:12.530 --> 54:14.115
- OK!
- All right!

54:21.203 --> 54:22.618
What?

54:24.802 --> 54:26.682
I needed this.

54:28.391 --> 54:29.829
Me too.

55:10.692 --> 55:11.673
No.

55:31.513 --> 55:34.063
- Well done, officer.
- Yeah.

55:35.654 --> 55:37.728
You mocking me?

55:39.464 --> 55:41.524
What are you gonna do about it?

55:42.315 --> 55:44.890
Don't make me get the handcuffs.

55:45.022 --> 55:47.964
Promises, promises...

55:52.222 --> 55:53.354
Hello?

55:53.354 --> 55:56.258
Hello, this is Doctor Badell
from Valley Medical Center.

55:56.258 --> 55:57.658
Is this Becca Holt?

55:57.658 --> 55:59.954
- What?
- Is this Becca Holt?

55:59.954 --> 56:04.663
We have your sister here, Kate Holt, in IC.
We need you to come in immediately.

56:04.663 --> 56:06.239
Where?

56:35.346 --> 56:38.316
You look like shit.

56:40.803 --> 56:42.404
Hey, champ.

56:43.420 --> 56:44.968
Lily...

56:44.968 --> 56:46.674
She's fine.

56:48.111 --> 56:50.377
She's with Zeke.

56:51.213 --> 56:54.279
Take care of her, OK?

56:54.420 --> 56:57.038
No, no...

56:57.524 --> 57:01.298
You'll be just fine. 
You can take care of her yourself.

57:02.948 --> 57:06.241
If I make it out of this...

57:08.144 --> 57:10.804
I won't make it out there.

57:25.612 --> 57:27.690
I love you.

57:33.188 --> 57:36.242
I got about 25 grand stashed away.

57:36.934 --> 57:38.834
It's not enough.

57:39.289 --> 57:41.031
What about you?

57:41.678 --> 57:43.993
- I can handle one fight.
- Yeah.

57:43.993 --> 57:47.108
Or maybe I should just follow you...
Call your ex and the cavalry,

57:47.108 --> 57:50.266
and put an end to this bullshit
you're getting yourself into!

57:51.531 --> 57:54.127
It's not gonna do any good
and you know that.

57:54.127 --> 57:58.244
I just need to know you have Lily
and Dad if I can't pull this off.

57:58.850 --> 58:02.699
You know I will, you know that.
But what about you?

58:05.494 --> 58:08.768
How long's it been
since you fought? Huh?

58:09.457 --> 58:13.456
You think you're just gonna step
in there and beat that monster?

58:13.843 --> 58:16.033
Shit, Becca, come on!

58:19.173 --> 58:21.627
Guaranteed pay-outs.

58:23.027 --> 58:24.352
What?

58:30.237 --> 58:32.451
How much money
did you say you have?

58:39.815 --> 58:43.079
Welcome...
Ladies and Gentlemen...!

58:43.079 --> 58:48.260
To the final round of the biannual
free fighting championship!

58:53.507 --> 58:57.649
Tonight we have a very special event.

58:58.184 --> 59:02.878
On one side, we have
Claire "The Bull" Stronsom.

59:08.417 --> 59:10.427
On the other...!

59:10.505 --> 59:14.031
You've heard her name
echo through these walls.

59:14.297 --> 59:18.204
A myth...
An urban legend!

59:18.483 --> 59:22.203
Right here!
Before your very own eyes!

59:22.203 --> 59:25.496
Bex "The Beast" Holt!

59:34.686 --> 59:37.834
Ladies, ready?

59:38.603 --> 59:42.872
No weapons...
No dying...

01:00:26.251 --> 01:00:28.076
Come on!
Knock her out!

01:00:47.997 --> 01:00:50.104
You know you got this, Becca!

01:01:00.544 --> 01:01:05.864
You're still undefeated FFC champion,
Claire "Bull" Stronsom!

01:01:28.267 --> 01:01:29.564
OK.

01:01:31.358 --> 01:01:33.880
Give it up for the "The Bull", yeah?

01:01:46.792 --> 01:01:48.964
Your winnings.

01:01:51.696 --> 01:01:53.881
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

01:01:56.177 --> 01:01:58.387
You should have won.

01:02:06.421 --> 01:02:08.388
Excuse me.

01:02:09.542 --> 01:02:11.385
Miss, I really don't think she should...

01:02:11.385 --> 01:02:13.777
That's fine.
She can sit right here.

01:02:13.802 --> 01:02:15.642
Here, Lily.

01:02:16.695 --> 01:02:19.776
OK, I'm gonna go see
how mummy's doing, OK?

01:02:19.776 --> 01:02:22.008
You just sight right
here until I get back.

01:02:22.166 --> 01:02:24.938
When she gets better,
will you stay with us?

01:02:24.938 --> 01:02:28.298
You be a good girl,
and we'll see, OK?

01:02:38.164 --> 01:02:39.623
Hi!

01:02:52.568 --> 01:02:56.063
Breathe, Kate.
Breathe, baby...

01:02:57.485 --> 01:02:59.137
Nurse!

01:02:59.954 --> 01:03:02.422
- Help!
- What happened?

01:03:02.657 --> 01:03:05.711
- She pulled the tube out.
- That's impossible, she can't move.

01:03:05.781 --> 01:03:07.005
Oh, God!

01:03:07.534 --> 01:03:10.250
Code blue 316,
code blue 316!

01:03:10.250 --> 01:03:14.299
Who unplugged her ECG? I'm gonna have to ask you
to wait outside, please, and wait for me there!

01:03:14.299 --> 01:03:17.588
- Plug-out time? - Two and half minutes.
- Cardiac arrest? - No respiratory.

01:03:17.588 --> 01:03:21.422
- The crash cart? - It's already on it's way.
- So, it's coming, we're starting out with 100!

01:03:23.509 --> 01:03:25.129
Where's that cart?

01:03:25.930 --> 01:03:28.627
Wait, hey, miss, wait! Hey!

01:03:28.736 --> 01:03:32.287
- Excuse me! Miss, hey...!
-Lily, stay right there, OK?

01:03:32.364 --> 01:03:34.184
Take care of her!

01:04:05.153 --> 01:04:06.717
Talk!

01:04:07.591 --> 01:04:11.488
Bex "The Beast",
What are you gonna do?

01:04:12.328 --> 01:04:15.333
Are you gonna kill me?
Kill me!

01:04:17.647 --> 01:04:19.316
Talk!

01:04:19.964 --> 01:04:23.015
It was him, wasn't it?
It was him!

01:04:23.015 --> 01:04:25.285
We lost everything tonight,

01:04:25.310 --> 01:04:27.544
betting on Bex "The Beast".

01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:30.549
You shouldn't have done that.

01:04:31.781 --> 01:04:35.310
You're gonna have to hurry if you
wanna save the rest of the family.

01:06:00.679 --> 01:06:02.859
Oh, shit.

01:06:03.550 --> 01:06:05.734
Everything all right in there, Holt?

01:06:07.301 --> 01:06:09.679
No, but it will be.

01:06:10.788 --> 01:06:13.120
Don't hurt yourself now.

01:06:13.653 --> 01:06:15.976
Big day for you tomorrow.

01:06:16.122 --> 01:06:19.200
Yeah, it will be for you
if I don't get the system working.

01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:22.506
Hell, D block can go a couple of days
without hot water.

01:06:22.690 --> 01:06:24.377
Oh, yeah?

01:06:24.712 --> 01:06:27.474
Ever met the guys in D block?

01:06:27.759 --> 01:06:30.182
No, never had the pleasure.

01:06:30.243 --> 01:06:33.253
Well, pleasure is the last thing
you get from those guys.

01:06:33.361 --> 01:06:36.940
Yeah, well, if you fix this, we ain't
gonna have no problems now, are we?

01:06:48.274 --> 01:06:52.059
You know the water PH levels
are way off the chart, right?

01:06:52.059 --> 01:06:54.556
You should have that checked out soon.

01:06:55.648 --> 01:06:59.126
What are you, a fucking
scientist now, old man?

01:07:04.078 --> 01:07:09.544
Erm... well, I got a master's degree
in chemical engineering, so, yes.

01:07:11.657 --> 01:07:16.578
You know, like, PH level can cause
corrosive damages to your pipe ring.

01:07:18.076 --> 01:07:20.141
Like this one.

01:08:42.742 --> 01:08:45.225
Not bad for an old man, huh...

01:09:13.404 --> 01:09:16.113
I don't know what got
into these guys...

01:09:16.270 --> 01:09:19.328
Beat each other up pretty
bad, I tried to stop them,

01:09:19.328 --> 01:09:21.703
they just wouldn't listen.

01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:24.776
Look, I don't want any trouble.

01:09:24.801 --> 01:09:26.857
Stop tight there, Holt.

01:09:26.881 --> 01:09:29.349
If you're gonna shoot
me with that Taser,

01:09:29.349 --> 01:09:34.040
there's no guarantee it's gonna
paralyze me, if it doesn't... well...

01:09:35.524 --> 01:09:38.413
I don't know if I can keep my cool,
if you know what I mean...

01:09:41.197 --> 01:09:42.491
Yeah.

01:09:43.237 --> 01:09:45.776
Well, I did my job...

01:09:46.353 --> 01:09:48.312
fixed that pipe...

01:09:48.689 --> 01:09:52.535
and in return, 
what I would really love...

01:09:53.416 --> 01:09:55.704
is to make a phone call.

01:09:58.705 --> 01:10:00.352
Yeah.

01:10:04.778 --> 01:10:06.627
Good choice.

01:10:12.328 --> 01:10:14.338
She's asleep.

01:10:18.712 --> 01:10:21.047
What do you wanna do now?

01:10:21.913 --> 01:10:24.380
I can help you.

01:10:27.559 --> 01:10:30.461
Paul Tardielo, remember him?

01:10:32.333 --> 01:10:35.812
They found his blood
smeared on my Dad's shirt.

01:10:36.388 --> 01:10:38.613
Along with two others, remember?

01:10:38.613 --> 01:10:39.938
Yeah.

01:10:39.938 --> 01:10:43.174
He always had a sick obsession with her.

01:10:43.174 --> 01:10:44.952
And now, he's dead.

01:10:44.977 --> 01:10:48.382
Your Dad made sure of that
when he bashed in his skull.

01:10:50.065 --> 01:10:52.430
But he didn't.

01:10:55.338 --> 01:10:58.654
He didn't find Kate crying that night.

01:11:07.207 --> 01:11:08.722
I did.

01:11:08.722 --> 01:11:12.512
I wanted to call the cops, 
I wanted to tell Dad, but...

01:11:14.329 --> 01:11:16.411
More than that...

01:11:17.038 --> 01:11:19.833
I just wanted them to die.

01:11:24.073 --> 01:11:26.262
They were laughing when I got there.

01:11:29.143 --> 01:11:30.937
I killed them.

01:11:33.433 --> 01:11:35.659
And I killed them some more.

01:11:39.091 --> 01:11:41.167
And I liked it.

01:11:51.565 --> 01:11:55.736
By the time Kate told Dad
and he got there,

01:11:55.774 --> 01:11:58.376
it was too late for them.

01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:04.987
He gave me his hoodie...

01:12:05.806 --> 01:12:09.280
covered my face 
and told me to walk straight home.

01:12:19.309 --> 01:12:23.131
I let my Dad take the fall
for a crime he didn't even commit.

01:12:27.104 --> 01:12:30.018
I thought he'd be fine
if I left, you know?

01:12:31.172 --> 01:12:33.466
That I could just leave it behind.

01:12:37.218 --> 01:12:42.133
Every move has led me to this...
Right now.

01:12:47.091 --> 01:12:49.071
I'd like to know why.

01:13:01.051 --> 01:13:02.685
Hello?

01:13:03.444 --> 01:13:04.935
You OK?

01:13:05.221 --> 01:13:07.256
I'm fine, Dad.

01:13:09.455 --> 01:13:11.053
But Kate...

01:13:13.775 --> 01:13:15.545
She's gone.

01:13:19.159 --> 01:13:22.700
Listen, take Lily to Bakersfield.

01:13:23.192 --> 01:13:25.233
- I'll be there...
- No!

01:13:25.898 --> 01:13:29.183
Listen to me, try to understand
what I'm trying to tell you.

01:13:29.183 --> 01:13:30.467
I know what
you're thinking.

01:13:30.467 --> 01:13:33.721
If you do this 
and it doesn't work out well,

01:13:33.721 --> 01:13:38.140
everything we've done, this five years,
everything will be for nothing.

01:13:38.296 --> 01:13:41.188
We'll be back where we started,
do you understand?

01:13:44.706 --> 01:13:47.653
I can help you,
we can fix this.

01:13:47.919 --> 01:13:50.084
I don't wanna fix it.

01:13:51.086 --> 01:13:53.246
I wanna end it!

01:14:26.368 --> 01:14:29.562
Rick, front door camera's out,
give it a look, yeah?

01:14:29.919 --> 01:14:31.828
Rick, are you there, bruv?

01:14:51.952 --> 01:14:52.897
Claire!

01:14:52.897 --> 01:14:56.405
I understand, mhmm,
I get it.

01:14:57.127 --> 01:14:59.217
I'll make it up to you.

01:15:00.198 --> 01:15:03.357
Mhmm...
I'll double our next fight.

01:15:04.676 --> 01:15:05.857
Mhmm.

01:15:07.095 --> 01:15:08.342
Yeah...

01:15:09.982 --> 01:15:11.540
Landon...

01:15:12.721 --> 01:15:14.443
She's here.

01:15:21.777 --> 01:15:24.190
God dammit, Micah!
Find her!

01:15:39.359 --> 01:15:41.034
What happened?

01:15:41.461 --> 01:15:44.301
Landon, we need to leave.

01:15:44.326 --> 01:15:46.468
I don't think this is gonna end,
we need to leave now...

01:15:46.468 --> 01:15:47.764
No.

01:15:49.422 --> 01:15:50.286
No.

01:15:50.286 --> 01:15:53.102
Are you mental, bruv?
She's bashed a man's skull in!

01:15:53.102 --> 01:15:55.075
It's a fucking devil woman, bruv!

01:15:55.075 --> 01:15:58.703
- I don't want none of it!
- Not going anywhere!

01:16:00.610 --> 01:16:02.819
I built this place!

01:16:03.196 --> 01:16:05.108
I made you!

01:16:10.509 --> 01:16:16.992
I am not letting no majie
crow take down this nest!

01:16:22.501 --> 01:16:24.579
You hear that?

01:16:29.219 --> 01:16:30.974
Claire...

01:16:31.473 --> 01:16:33.543
Sunshine...

01:16:37.937 --> 01:16:40.548
I want you to set her free.

01:18:08.964 --> 01:18:11.182
She's still breathing.

01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:13.955
And what are you gonna do about it, huh?

01:18:14.181 --> 01:18:16.700
Get her a Band-Aid?

01:18:17.675 --> 01:18:21.549
Leave her and
kill that little bitch!

01:18:24.898 --> 01:18:27.380
Did I stutter?

01:18:30.582 --> 01:18:32.935
Get the fuck out of my face!

01:18:44.602 --> 01:18:47.480
May God hold you on
the palm of His hand...

01:18:56.959 --> 01:18:59.443
I don't care what you do here.

01:19:00.476 --> 01:19:02.790
I'm not like this...

01:19:03.673 --> 01:19:05.896
Never have been.

01:19:06.690 --> 01:19:08.960
Don't underestimate him.

01:19:11.205 --> 01:19:13.385
Do it for Kate.

01:19:17.896 --> 01:19:19.238
Micah?

01:19:20.773 --> 01:19:22.888
♪ Micah... ♪

01:19:37.244 --> 01:19:43.137
All you had to do...
was do what you do best.

01:19:44.801 --> 01:19:49.411
But no...
you had to fuck me!

01:19:50.752 --> 01:19:53.449
Yeah, I'll go for you...

01:19:54.408 --> 01:19:57.243
But I'll tell you what's
gonna happen now.

01:19:57.579 --> 01:20:00.047
I'm gonna play a little game.

01:20:02.499 --> 01:20:06.297
I'm going to find
your little fucking niece...

01:20:06.628 --> 01:20:11.021
I'm gonna choke her
until she can't breathe anymore.

01:20:11.247 --> 01:20:15.812
And then I'm gonna find your father
and I'm gonna fucking kill him.

01:20:16.866 --> 01:20:19.820
This is the best deal
you're gonna get!

01:20:50.770 --> 01:20:55.938
Do you think you're the
only monster here? Huh?

01:20:56.312 --> 01:20:57.448
Huh?

01:21:01.812 --> 01:21:03.819
Need some air?

01:21:35.834 --> 01:21:38.622
How sweet revenge, yes?

01:21:39.888 --> 01:21:42.419
This is not revenge.

01:21:44.461 --> 01:21:46.993
This is justice.

01:22:49.968 --> 01:22:53.148
I'm not gonna be able
to make this go away.

01:22:53.691 --> 01:22:55.601
You won't need to.

01:22:57.804 --> 01:23:00.778
You know they're all gonna come
after you for this.

01:23:01.715 --> 01:23:03.512
I know.

01:23:05.333 --> 01:23:07.398
Why, Becca?

01:23:10.623 --> 01:23:13.724
'Cos sometimes our true nature
isn't good enough.

01:23:17.384 --> 01:23:22.097
Sometimes people deserve more than
what the world does allow them to be.

01:23:27.505 --> 01:23:30.384
I MADE IT ACROSS

01:23:35.781 --> 01:23:40.188
Sometimes sacrifice
needs to be rewarded.

01:23:49.779 --> 01:23:52.375
I think I can buy you...

01:23:53.090 --> 01:23:54.694
a couple of days.

01:23:57.483 --> 01:23:59.214
That's it.

01:24:00.062 --> 01:24:01.932
That's enough.

01:24:12.710 --> 01:24:14.739
Where will you go?

01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:50.168
Hi!

01:24:51.962 --> 01:24:53.479
Hey!

01:24:55.666 --> 01:24:57.929
Out of all the places...

01:25:05.807 --> 01:25:09.087
- I missed you.
- I missed you too.

01:25:14.556 --> 01:25:17.432
So what do you think, Lily? 
Hmm?

01:25:19.492 --> 01:25:20.684
I like it.

01:25:20.709 --> 01:25:22.018
Yeah...

01:25:22.018 --> 01:25:24.187
Of course you do.
