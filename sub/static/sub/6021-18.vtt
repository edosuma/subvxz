WEBVTT

00:10.210 --> 00:12.041
-Elaine, cake?
-Oh, no thanks.

00:12.212 --> 00:13.577
It's Walter's special day.

00:14.147 --> 00:16.138
There are 200 people
who work in this office.

00:16.315 --> 00:18.784
Every day is somebody's
special day.

00:19.819 --> 00:21.252
Elaine, where you going?

00:21.421 --> 00:23.412
It's Walter's last day.
We have to celebrate.

00:23.590 --> 00:25.421
It's his birthday
and it's his last day?

00:25.592 --> 00:27.560
This is other Walter from returns.

00:27.727 --> 00:29.422
Hey, what's going on here?

00:29.596 --> 00:31.063
Surprise!

00:31.231 --> 00:32.424
Oh, guys.

00:32.799 --> 00:35.393
Elaine, it's my last day.

00:35.568 --> 00:36.592
Have a piece.

00:36.770 --> 00:39.204
All right, pile it on.

00:41.000 --> 00:47.074

00:54.421 --> 00:56.514
What is so bad about having
a piece of cake?

00:56.689 --> 00:59.089
It is the forced socializing.

00:59.259 --> 01:01.250
Just because
we work in the same office...

01:01.428 --> 01:03.396
...why do we have to act like
we're friends?

01:03.563 --> 01:04.791
Why aren't you there now?

01:04.964 --> 01:08.695
I had to take a sick day,
I'm so sick of these people.

01:10.170 --> 01:12.866
I talked to Lisi and tomorrow night's
good for her.

01:13.039 --> 01:16.998
I shouldn't go out with
a friend of yours. I foresee messiness.

01:17.177 --> 01:19.737
You're better off sitting around
reading comic books...

01:19.913 --> 01:21.847
...and eating spaghetti
at 2 in the morning.

01:22.015 --> 01:24.984
Hey, speaking of tomato sauce,
wanna come with me to Mario's Pizza?

01:25.151 --> 01:29.247
-Your old high school hangout. Why?
-They're closing. Going for a last slice.

01:30.156 --> 01:33.387
Hey. All right. Hi. Check it out, huh?

01:33.560 --> 01:36.859
Official police caution tape.

01:37.030 --> 01:38.588
Look at that.

01:39.566 --> 01:42.592
Step back, son,
there's nothing to see here.

01:43.269 --> 01:44.327
Where did you get this?

01:44.504 --> 01:46.131
I got it from my cop buddy, Doug.

01:46.306 --> 01:49.275
You sure have a lot of friends.
How come I never see any of them?

01:49.442 --> 01:51.307
They wanna know
why they never see you.

01:55.348 --> 01:57.213
I'm gonna eat that later.

01:57.584 --> 01:58.778
So they just gave you this?

01:58.952 --> 02:01.785
Oh, no, no, I had to fish around
in the evidence room for it.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.183
They're all preoccupied...

02:03.356 --> 02:05.824
...trying to hunt down
this new psycho serial killer...

02:05.992 --> 02:08.187
...the Lopper. All right, I'll see you.

02:08.360 --> 02:10.488
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Who is the Lopper?

02:10.663 --> 02:11.652
It's no big deal.

02:11.831 --> 02:15.358
It's just some guy, he's been running
around Riverside Park, you know...

02:15.535 --> 02:18.470
-...cutting people's heads off.
-How have I never read about this?

02:18.638 --> 02:22.802
The police, they've been having some
internal dissension about the name.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.307
What are the other titles?

02:24.477 --> 02:28.504
Heads-o. The De-Nogginizer.

02:29.282 --> 02:30.681
Son of Dad.

02:30.850 --> 02:33.011
-Son of Dad?
-Yeah, that was my suggestion.

02:33.186 --> 02:35.586
It's sort of a catch-all.

02:38.391 --> 02:40.018
Mario's Pizza.

02:40.193 --> 02:42.354
Just as she was.

02:42.529 --> 02:44.929
Hey, Mario. Remember us?

02:45.298 --> 02:46.788
No.

02:47.600 --> 02:49.261
We used to come in every day.

02:49.435 --> 02:51.062
So where you been?

02:51.237 --> 02:52.568
We're tanking here.

02:53.439 --> 02:55.839
We'll have two slices
and two grape sodas.

02:56.009 --> 02:58.876
Oh, thanks. That'll save us.

02:59.245 --> 03:01.805
All right, make it the large sodas.

03:02.815 --> 03:05.716
Hey, Jerry, remember Frogger?

03:05.885 --> 03:09.013
I used to be so into this game.

03:09.189 --> 03:12.124
Getting that frog across the street
was my entire life.

03:12.292 --> 03:14.783
Yeah, and then you went on to....

03:15.328 --> 03:16.955
It's a good game.

03:17.330 --> 03:18.456
Watch the truck.

03:18.631 --> 03:19.859
Double jump.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.365
Eat the fly. Eat it!

03:23.836 --> 03:25.428
Thanks a lot.

03:25.605 --> 03:27.232
Beat it, punk.

03:28.341 --> 03:30.707
Hey, look at the high score. "GLC."

03:30.877 --> 03:32.902
George Louis Costanza.
That's not you, is it?

03:33.246 --> 03:34.474
Yes.

03:34.647 --> 03:36.171
Eight hundred and sixty thousand.

03:36.349 --> 03:38.112
I can't believe it's still standing.

03:38.284 --> 03:40.184
No one has beaten me
in, like, ten years.

03:40.353 --> 03:44.983
-I remember that night.
-Oh, I was unstoppable.

03:45.225 --> 03:48.956
Perfect combination of Mountain Dew
and mozzarella.

03:49.128 --> 03:51.961
Just the right amount of grease
on the joystick.

03:52.131 --> 03:54.793
Here's your pizza, pea brains.

03:57.203 --> 04:00.070
I think I remember
why we stopped coming here.

04:03.743 --> 04:06.940
<i>This pen smells really bad.</i>

04:07.113 --> 04:09.513
<i>So why do I keep smelling it?</i>

04:09.882 --> 04:12.817
<i>Is it too late for me
to go to law school?</i>

04:15.421 --> 04:17.411
-What is this?
-You were out sick yesterday...

04:17.589 --> 04:19.057
...so we got you a get-well cake.

04:19.225 --> 04:20.920
It's carrot. It's good for you.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.460
<i>Get well, get well soon
We wish you to get well--</i>

04:23.630 --> 04:26.190
Stop it! That's not even a song.

04:27.467 --> 04:29.867
I mean, now we're celebrating
a sick day?

04:30.169 --> 04:33.002
-I think it's nice.
-What? What is nice?

04:33.172 --> 04:35.231
Trying to fill the void
in your life...

04:35.408 --> 04:38.468
...with flour and sugar
and egg and vanilla?

04:38.645 --> 04:41.637
I mean, we are all unhappy.

04:41.814 --> 04:44.339
Do we have to be fat too?

04:45.418 --> 04:48.012
Not you, Becky. I know you have
a slow metabolism.

04:49.622 --> 04:52.955
I don't want one more piece of cake
in my office.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.889
<i>Get well, get well soon--</i>

04:55.061 --> 04:56.858
It's not happening.

04:58.631 --> 05:00.531
Can we still eat it?

05:05.271 --> 05:07.705
I'll tell you, Lisi, I never expected
that movie to--

05:07.874 --> 05:09.171
End underwater.

05:09.342 --> 05:11.970
--be that long.
I mean, most action movies are--

05:12.145 --> 05:13.976
So much more violent.

05:14.380 --> 05:16.746
--not as long.

05:17.950 --> 05:20.475
-Well, I should probably--
-Get going.

05:21.354 --> 05:22.343
Yeah.

05:22.722 --> 05:25.213
Well, it was nice meeting you.
I'm sure, I'll see you--

05:25.391 --> 05:27.382
-Eight tomorrow?
-Actually, that's--

05:27.560 --> 05:28.754
What you were thinking.

05:30.296 --> 05:31.320
Right.

05:35.501 --> 05:39.335
Oh, here you are. You want to...?

05:39.505 --> 05:42.872
Sure. How about this one?

05:43.976 --> 05:46.103
Well, I'm doing it, Jerry.

05:46.279 --> 05:48.008
I'm buying the Frogger machine.

05:48.181 --> 05:51.617
-Now the torch will burn forever.
-Fabulous.

05:51.784 --> 05:54.344
-Now, you're really doing something.
-Yeah.

05:55.321 --> 05:58.119
Wanna come to Mario's Pizza
and help me pick up the Frogger?

05:58.291 --> 06:01.192
Hey, how you gonna keep the machine
plugged in while you move it?

06:01.361 --> 06:02.385
What?

06:02.562 --> 06:06.123
Once you unplug the machine,
all the scores will be erased.

06:11.070 --> 06:12.503
You're right.

06:13.272 --> 06:15.934
Why must there always be
a problem?

06:16.109 --> 06:18.634
You'd think just once,
I could get a break.

06:18.811 --> 06:21.143
God knows I earned it
with that score.

06:24.917 --> 06:26.475
Well, more bad news, Jerry.

06:26.652 --> 06:29.644
The police found another victim
of the Lopper in Riverside Park.

06:29.822 --> 06:32.882
I saw the photo
and it looked a lot like you.

06:33.059 --> 06:35.892
There's a lot of people walking around
that look like me.

06:36.195 --> 06:38.561
Not as many as there used to be.

06:40.566 --> 06:43.535
No, I need a guy that can rig
a Frogger machine...

06:43.703 --> 06:47.230
...so that I can move it without losing
power because I have the high score.

06:48.441 --> 06:49.999
Hello?

06:50.576 --> 06:53.101
George, you're not gonna find
an electrician like that...

06:53.279 --> 06:54.337
...in the yellow pages.

06:54.514 --> 06:56.914
No, I know just the guy
who can do this.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.950
-Another friend?
-Oh, no, no, no. This guy is no friend.

07:00.119 --> 07:02.212
In fact, we don't even get along.

07:02.388 --> 07:03.912
Well, is he good, Kramer?

07:04.090 --> 07:05.489
Oh, he's the best.

07:05.658 --> 07:07.421
And the worst.

07:08.694 --> 07:10.685
Kramer, listen to me.

07:11.164 --> 07:13.632
I'm never gonna have a child.

07:14.734 --> 07:17.862
If I lose this Frogger high score...

07:18.037 --> 07:19.971
...that's it for me.

07:21.340 --> 07:25.470
Believe me, George,
you can count on Slippery Pete.

07:27.180 --> 07:30.377
-Slippery Pete?
-I don't care for the name, either.

07:30.550 --> 07:32.950
In fact, that's one of the things
that we argue about.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.313
All right.

07:34.487 --> 07:36.614
I'm gonna find a guy with a truck.

07:36.789 --> 07:38.882
GLC must live on.

07:43.362 --> 07:44.829
Come on.

07:48.267 --> 07:50.701
-Hello?
-So how's it going with my friend?

07:50.870 --> 07:54.465
She's a sentence finisher.
It's like dating Mad Libs.

07:56.142 --> 07:58.610
-What is that?
-Oh, it's a cake party.

07:58.778 --> 08:01.269
It's the third one today.

08:01.714 --> 08:05.206
I didn't realize how hooked
I got on that 4:00 sugar rush.

08:05.384 --> 08:08.945
-So join in.
-I can't. I denounced them.

08:09.522 --> 08:11.285
Maybe I'll go raid Peterman's fridge.

08:11.457 --> 08:13.584
He's always got a truffle
or something in there.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.829
-Hey, what? What is--?
-Yeah, I dropped an egg.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.067
Be careful.

08:27.840 --> 08:29.432
Anybody here?

08:29.609 --> 08:31.406
Peter-boy?

08:40.953 --> 08:42.852
It's a cakewalk.

08:46.058 --> 08:49.357
<i>Get well, get well soon
We wish you to get well</i>

08:51.397 --> 08:54.924
Oh, what a stirring little anthem
of wellness.

08:55.101 --> 08:56.568
Elaine.

08:56.736 --> 09:00.069
-Mr. Peterman.
-We missed you at the get-well party.

09:00.239 --> 09:03.731
Poor old Walt has a polyp
in the duodenum.

09:05.278 --> 09:08.042
It's benign but, oh, still a bastard.

09:09.081 --> 09:10.639
Oh, Elaine...

09:10.816 --> 09:14.217
-...can you keep a secret?
-No, sir, I can't.

09:15.154 --> 09:20.387
Inside that small, college-boy
mini-fridge is my latest acquisition.

09:21.460 --> 09:23.155
A slice of cake from the wedding...

09:23.329 --> 09:27.732
...of King Edward VIII
to Wallis Simpson, circa 1937.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.197
The price?

09:29.368 --> 09:31.893
Twenty-nine thousand dollars.

09:37.910 --> 09:40.970
-Well, Lisi, that was another--
-Lovely evening.

09:41.147 --> 09:43.081
--really bad meal.

09:43.249 --> 09:44.682
I was thinking maybe we should--

09:44.850 --> 09:46.545
Go for a hansom cab ride?

09:46.719 --> 09:49.813
--call it a night. I'll walk you home.
Where do you live?

09:49.989 --> 09:51.684
84th Street, right off Riverside Park.

09:51.857 --> 09:53.256
Riverside Park.

09:53.426 --> 09:56.862
-I thought we were going--
-Back to my place, that's right.

09:59.999 --> 10:01.193
So you slept with her?

10:01.367 --> 10:03.858
She lives right off Riverside Park.

10:04.036 --> 10:06.834
I was scared of the Lopper,
so I let her stay over.

10:07.006 --> 10:09.167
And you automatically
sleep with her?

10:09.342 --> 10:11.776
I just wanted to make out a little,
but she kind of--

10:11.944 --> 10:14.276
-Finished your thought.
-Yeah.

10:16.882 --> 10:17.940
Guess what I ate?

10:18.117 --> 10:19.550
An ostrich burger?

10:20.820 --> 10:25.348
No. A $29,000 piece of cake.

10:25.524 --> 10:28.288
Peterman got it at the Duke
and Duchess of Windsor auction.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.793
It was the most romantic thing
I've ever eaten.

10:30.963 --> 10:33.363
-How did it taste?
-A little stale.

10:34.367 --> 10:37.996
So you sleeping with Peterman?

10:38.170 --> 10:39.330
No.

10:41.207 --> 10:42.504
He doesn't know I ate it.

10:42.675 --> 10:44.074
In fact, he almost caught me.

10:44.243 --> 10:47.144
I have to sneak back in
and even it out.

10:47.580 --> 10:51.846
Well, they say ostrich has less fat,
but you eat more of it.

10:53.819 --> 10:56.515
Hey, so I talked to Lisi...

10:57.423 --> 11:00.256
...and she has got
a big surprise for you.

11:00.426 --> 11:03.395
She's planning a weekend trip
to Pennsylvania Dutch country.

11:03.562 --> 11:05.860
Pennsylvania Dutch country?

11:06.032 --> 11:09.024
No, that's the serious-relationship
weekend place.

11:09.201 --> 11:12.102
-What is going on with you two?
-I think by sleeping with her...

11:12.271 --> 11:14.603
...I may have sent her
the wrong message.

11:15.474 --> 11:16.463
What's that?

11:17.009 --> 11:18.499
Four o'clock sugar fix.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.373
Well, I'm calling this off right now.

11:20.579 --> 11:23.844
No, no, you are way past
the phone-call-breakup stage.

11:24.016 --> 11:26.416
I'm not going over there.
That's where the Lopper is.

11:26.886 --> 11:29.150
It's daylight.
It won't take you that long.

11:29.321 --> 11:31.789
Just make a clean break.

11:36.062 --> 11:40.590
Just a little off the side. Perfect.

11:42.535 --> 11:45.060
No point in wasting 1200 bucks.

11:50.710 --> 11:53.770
<i>Oh, commander,
isn't the wedding marvelous?</i>

11:55.214 --> 11:57.114
<i>The cake? Oh, I shouldn't.</i>

11:57.283 --> 11:58.807
<i>I mustn't.</i>

11:58.984 --> 12:00.611
What the hell.

12:04.223 --> 12:07.886
Now, each of you is here because
you're the best at what you do.

12:08.060 --> 12:09.049
Slippery Pete.

12:10.029 --> 12:13.396
Kramer tells me you are one hell
of a rogue electrician.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.796
And, Shlomo,
you're the best truck driver.

12:15.968 --> 12:18.300
I don't know if I'm the best.

12:18.471 --> 12:19.460
You're very good.

12:19.638 --> 12:21.503
Let's say good.

12:21.674 --> 12:23.539
Okay, good.

12:23.709 --> 12:26.109
Kramer, you're in charge
of taping off a loading zone.

12:26.278 --> 12:27.745
Lock and load.

12:27.913 --> 12:29.778
Think you can handle that,
numb-nuts?

12:29.949 --> 12:31.780
All right, all right, come on now.

12:31.951 --> 12:33.680
That was my mail-order bride.

12:33.853 --> 12:35.582
You weren't home,
so I signed for her.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.019
It doesn't give you the right
to make out with her.

12:38.190 --> 12:39.589
You weren't even married yet.

12:39.759 --> 12:44.093
All right, all right, calm down.
Calm down. Calm down.

12:44.263 --> 12:46.697
Whatever happened
in the past, is past.

12:46.866 --> 12:49.300
All right. Now, this is the--

12:49.468 --> 12:51.527
The basic layout for Mario's Pizza.

12:51.704 --> 12:56.073
So, what kind of jail time
are we looking at if we're caught?

12:57.777 --> 12:58.766
What do you mean?

12:58.944 --> 13:00.935
We're stealing this thing, right?

13:01.113 --> 13:03.104
No, I paid for it.

13:03.682 --> 13:06.446
-I thought we were stealing it.
-Feels like we're stealing it.

13:06.619 --> 13:07.608
We're not stealing.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.187
-I definitely thought we're stealing it.
-All right.

13:10.356 --> 13:13.120
Let's focus.
Can we get back to the plan?

13:13.292 --> 13:15.351
Well, I need a battery
for this kind of job.

13:15.528 --> 13:17.553
Can I at least steal a battery?

13:17.897 --> 13:19.660
Fine, steal the battery.

13:20.199 --> 13:23.396
Now, all right, here is the Frogger.

13:23.569 --> 13:24.968
This is the front door...

13:25.137 --> 13:26.502
...and this is the outlet.

13:26.672 --> 13:27.866
What's that?

13:28.040 --> 13:29.439
The outlet?

13:29.809 --> 13:32.300
That's where the electricity
comes out of.

13:32.478 --> 13:34.708
Oh, you mean the holes?

13:36.882 --> 13:40.409
-Which one's the bathroom?
-Here.

13:40.586 --> 13:43.350
They put the Frogger with the toilet?

13:43.522 --> 13:44.921
The Frogger is here.

13:45.090 --> 13:47.024
George, I thought that was the door.

13:47.193 --> 13:50.788
-Where are the pizza ovens?
-I thought the bathroom was here.

13:51.697 --> 13:53.858
All right? You understand now?

13:54.900 --> 13:56.868
It's not that complicated.

14:00.506 --> 14:03.168
I need to replace
an antique piece of cake.

14:03.642 --> 14:05.337
Do you have anything that's been...

14:06.111 --> 14:08.375
...you know, lying around for a while?

14:09.348 --> 14:11.680
Something pre-war
would be just great.

14:13.419 --> 14:14.977
Oh, hey, Elaine.

14:15.154 --> 14:16.746
Oh, you got the munchies?

14:16.922 --> 14:19.413
No, Kramer, I am in big,
big, big trouble.

14:19.592 --> 14:22.152
I need a cake that looks like this.

14:22.561 --> 14:24.153
Oh yeah, Sotherby's.

14:24.330 --> 14:26.389
Yeah, they make good cake.

14:27.366 --> 14:29.698
-Do any of these look close?
-No.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.700
But I know,
I've seen cake just like that.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.270
Oh, Entenmann's, yeah.

14:33.439 --> 14:35.566
Entenmann's?
From the supermarket?

14:35.741 --> 14:37.572
No, they're not really
in the supermarket.

14:37.743 --> 14:40.405
They got their own case
at the end of the aisle.

14:44.316 --> 14:45.305
Hi, Lisi.

14:45.484 --> 14:48.476
-Hi, honey. Is that a bat?
-Yeah.

14:48.654 --> 14:50.588
I found it on the street.

14:50.756 --> 14:52.621
It's gotta be worth something.

14:52.791 --> 14:55.055
So, what do you want to do,
sweetheart?

14:55.227 --> 14:57.388
Well, before we do anything...

14:59.098 --> 15:00.565
...maybe we should talk.

15:02.234 --> 15:04.828
Then this Pennsylvania Dutch thing
comes out of nowhere.

15:05.004 --> 15:07.495
I mean, how am I supposed
to respond to that?

15:07.673 --> 15:11.734
Then may I say something
without being interrupted?

15:11.911 --> 15:14.402
Well, I'm sorry if I ruined your life.

15:14.580 --> 15:17.845
That's exactly what I set out to do.

15:22.454 --> 15:24.251
Are you afraid to kiss me in public?

15:24.423 --> 15:26.288
Have we even been in public?

15:26.458 --> 15:28.426
Now you're gonna tell me
what I'm thinking.

15:28.594 --> 15:32.052
Well, go ahead, because
I'd really like to know.

15:32.231 --> 15:33.721
You are not dumb.

15:33.899 --> 15:35.161
Don't say that.

15:36.502 --> 15:38.333
These beans are pretty good.

15:38.504 --> 15:39.596
Twenty minutes.

15:40.139 --> 15:43.074
Well, I'm sorry. I'm not Brad.

15:43.242 --> 15:44.903
I'm me.

15:45.311 --> 15:47.472
Nice to meet you.

15:48.514 --> 15:51.972
Boy, did your mother
do a number on you.

15:55.854 --> 15:58.288
Fine. So it's over.

15:58.457 --> 15:59.981
Oh, thank God.

16:01.727 --> 16:03.888
Why is it dark out? What time is it?

16:04.530 --> 16:05.519
Nine-thirty.

16:05.698 --> 16:07.893
We've been breaking up
for 10 hours?

16:08.067 --> 16:09.659
Goodbye, Jerry.

16:10.402 --> 16:11.562
Lopper.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.636
We should give this
a little more time.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.469
-See how it looks in the light of day.
-Out.

16:28.854 --> 16:30.481
Lopper.

16:32.491 --> 16:34.015
Lisi. Lisi, let me in.

16:34.193 --> 16:37.959
We can work this out. I was wrong,
you were right. I'll do anything.

16:45.371 --> 16:47.339
Jerry, you came for the big moment.

16:47.506 --> 16:48.996
No, I'm waiting for....

16:49.174 --> 16:50.835
Everything's timed out to perfection.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.137
Pete's got the Frogger
running on battery power.

16:53.312 --> 16:55.837
The truck'll be there.
Kramer's taped out a loading zone.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.073
-Sounds great.
-Yeah.

16:57.249 --> 17:00.082
-Come over tonight. We can play.
-Oh, I can't, I'm busy.

17:00.319 --> 17:01.911
I'm going away on a long weekend.

17:02.087 --> 17:04.714
-Where?
-Look what I found.

17:04.890 --> 17:07.324
I got one for you too.

17:09.661 --> 17:10.923
Oh, great.

17:11.497 --> 17:14.057
Why don't you put it in the car
so I don't accidentally...

17:14.233 --> 17:17.099
-...toss it in that dumpster?
-Okay.

17:17.269 --> 17:20.568
I'll meet thee in front of your place.
15 minutes.

17:21.807 --> 17:25.367
A long, long weekend.

17:25.544 --> 17:27.340
I hear thee.

17:31.116 --> 17:32.378
Elaine, excellent.

17:32.551 --> 17:35.281
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine,
Irwin Lubeck.

17:35.454 --> 17:37.081
-Oh, hello.
-Charmed.

17:37.756 --> 17:39.383
All right.

17:39.558 --> 17:40.786
Brace yourself, Lubeck...

17:40.959 --> 17:43.120
...you are about to be launched,
via pastry...

17:43.295 --> 17:46.822
...back to the wedding of one
of the most dashing and romantic...

17:46.999 --> 17:50.435
...Nazi sympathizers
of the entire British royal family.

17:50.602 --> 17:54.402
-I guess, I'll just--
-Oh, no, Elaine, stay. Lubeck here...

17:54.573 --> 17:57.406
...is the world's foremost
appraiser of vintage pastry.

17:58.610 --> 18:02.307
All right, Lubeck,
how much is she worth?

18:02.481 --> 18:03.948
I'd say about 219.

18:05.684 --> 18:08.812
Two hundred
and nineteen thousand dollars.

18:08.987 --> 18:10.682
Lubeck, you glorious tit-willow...

18:10.856 --> 18:14.189
...you just made me
a profit of a $190,000.

18:14.359 --> 18:17.453
No. $2.19.

18:17.629 --> 18:18.755
It's an Entenmann's.

18:21.500 --> 18:23.627
Do they have a castle in Windsor?

18:24.136 --> 18:27.003
No, they have a display case
at the end of the aisle.

18:28.707 --> 18:30.800
Oh, good Lord.

18:30.976 --> 18:33.001
You all right, Peterman?
You look ill.

18:34.780 --> 18:39.808
<i>Get well, get well soon
We want you to get well</i>

18:39.985 --> 18:44.115
<i>Get well, get well soon
We want you to get well</i>

18:46.859 --> 18:48.793
Hey. What are you guys doing?

18:48.961 --> 18:52.158
Eat the fly. Eat the fly. Got it.

18:52.331 --> 18:54.697
You idiots.
You're gonna wear down the battery.

18:54.867 --> 18:56.391
Oh, the batteries are fine.

18:56.568 --> 18:58.160
We've got...

18:58.337 --> 19:01.238
-...oh, God, only three minutes left.
-All right, quick.

19:01.406 --> 19:04.466
-Get this thing back in the pizzeria.
-George, they closed up.

19:04.643 --> 19:06.736
-I need an outlet.
-A what?

19:06.912 --> 19:11.178
-Holes. I need holes.
-The pharmacy's still open.

19:11.350 --> 19:15.719
All right, Kramer, you block off traffic.
You two, go sweet-talk the pharmacist.

19:16.555 --> 19:18.887
You owe me a quarter.

19:21.960 --> 19:23.621
Slippery Pete.

19:24.096 --> 19:25.256
Kramer, hurry up.

19:29.401 --> 19:31.562
I'm out. No tape left.

19:31.737 --> 19:33.500
Come on, I'll help you
push it across.

19:33.672 --> 19:35.970
Wait a minute. This looks familiar.

19:36.141 --> 19:38.268
This reminds me of something.

19:40.012 --> 19:42.071
-I can do this.
-By yourself?

19:42.247 --> 19:46.707
Jerry, I've been preparing
for this moment my entire life.

20:02.267 --> 20:04.394
He looks like a frog.

20:06.138 --> 20:07.867
So do you.

20:33.665 --> 20:35.394
Game over.

20:44.209 --> 20:46.234
Mr. Peterman, you wanted
to see me, sir?

20:46.411 --> 20:48.242
Elaine, up until a moment ago...

20:48.413 --> 20:51.849
...I was convinced that I was on the
receiving end of one of the oldest...

20:52.017 --> 20:53.575
...baker's grift in the books.

20:54.987 --> 20:56.318
The Entenmann's shim sham.

20:57.589 --> 21:01.184
Until I remembered the videotape
surveillance system...

21:01.360 --> 21:05.023
...that I installed to catch other Walter
using my latrine.

21:06.265 --> 21:10.031
But it also caught this.

21:25.117 --> 21:29.713
-Mr. Peterman, l--
-Elaine, I have a question for you.

21:29.888 --> 21:32.379
Is the item still...

21:32.557 --> 21:33.546
...with you?

21:37.129 --> 21:38.721
As far as I know.

21:38.897 --> 21:41.798
Do you know what happens
to a butter-based frosting...

21:41.967 --> 21:46.233
...after six decades in
a poorly-ventilated English basement?

21:47.439 --> 21:48.633
I guess I hadn't--

21:48.807 --> 21:51.139
I have a feeling what you
are about to go through...

21:51.310 --> 21:53.244
...is punishment enough.

21:56.748 --> 21:58.409
Dismissed.
