08:11.621 --> 08:14.189
Wrinkle?
You're the wrinkle, Voorhees.

08:17.584 --> 08:19.542
You know, moving forward,
you need to...

08:19.586 --> 08:21.370
I am not working
with that guy, Anthony.

08:21.413 --> 08:23.851
Come again?Me and Jamie caught him

U-Uh, but he's alleging
that Hobbs is hurting women,

08:41.042 --> 08:43.000
so we need to investigate.

08:43.044 --> 08:45.873
No, only if we can trust him.

08:45.916 --> 08:49.659
So, are you in or do I tap
the next undercover in line?

08:59.277 --> 09:00.801
Want me to play bad cop?

I can't report
what I didn't see.

09:56.900 --> 09:58.859

anyone who will listen

10:01.339 --> 10:02.863

when he asked why.

10:08.825 --> 10:10.479
Officer Valle is a good kid.

10:10.522 --> 10:12.307
I'm sorry he feels that way.

He also claims you referred
to the perp by name.

10:16.006 --> 10:17.399
I did.

10:17.442 --> 10:18.922
So you know her.

Sounds like
you're pulling for her.

10:27.104 --> 10:30.107
Isn't compassion
part of the job?

10:30.151 --> 10:32.196
Especially for your fellow cops.

10:34.155 --> 10:35.809
Lieutenant, it's rarely
black-and-white out there.

10:35.852 --> 10:37.985
That's why we're trained
to use our discretion.

10:38.028 --> 10:40.640
A cop gets assaulted,
I call that black-and-white.

10:44.818 --> 10:46.733
I don't have
anything else to say.

10:48.735 --> 10:50.693
Even if it's
your old man asking?

10:52.695 --> 10:56.830
Got to be some "I owe you one,
Dad" I can cash in on.

10:59.310 --> 11:02.662
I'm sorry. Sir.

11:06.883 --> 11:09.625
Then return to your command,
Sergeant.

11:17.067 --> 11:19.417
[exhales]

11:24.031 --> 11:26.860
[door closes]

11:26.903 --> 11:28.296
Well?

11:29.427 --> 11:31.778
I'd say he's lying his ass off.

11:39.263 --> 11:40.308
Don't.

11:41.309 --> 11:42.789
She'll use it on drugs.

11:45.313 --> 11:46.749
Come on, you're going to rehab.

11:46.793 --> 11:47.881
I'm not going anywhere.

11:47.924 --> 11:49.012
You promised you'd go

11:49.056 --> 11:50.057
the moment you got out of jail.

11:50.100 --> 11:54.322
I can't face it sober.

11:55.671 --> 11:57.455
That's the same thing
you said last time.

11:57.499 --> 11:59.631
So leave me alone.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.069
I never asked you to help me

12:02.112 --> 12:03.244
in the first place.

12:03.287 --> 12:04.985
Jill, listen to me.

12:05.028 --> 12:07.074
Every day is a new day,

12:07.117 --> 12:09.337
every day is a new chance. Hey.

12:09.380 --> 12:11.078
And there are places
that will help you.

12:11.121 --> 12:12.775
They keep kicking me out.

12:12.819 --> 12:14.385
Because you keep using.

12:14.429 --> 12:17.040
And then you go and get arrested
so you get a warm bed

12:17.084 --> 12:18.215
and a hot meal and over

12:18.259 --> 12:19.564
and over and over
and over and over again.

12:19.608 --> 12:22.785
I appreciate what you did
for me the other day.

12:22.829 --> 12:24.526
You should know that.

12:24.569 --> 12:25.875
I do.

12:25.919 --> 12:29.400
And I was a good person, once.

12:29.444 --> 12:30.924
You still are.

12:30.967 --> 12:33.622
It's just the addiction
that's bad.

12:33.665 --> 12:35.798
So do something about it.

12:35.842 --> 12:37.452
Hey, Jill.

12:37.495 --> 12:38.975
You're a fighter,

12:39.019 --> 12:40.498
so come with me
and let's fight this thing.

12:40.542 --> 12:43.371
I can't do this, Jamie.

12:44.938 --> 12:49.638
I lost this fight,
and no one can help me.

12:49.681 --> 12:52.380
So leave me be.

12:53.947 --> 12:55.731
Got it?

13:02.216 --> 13:04.609
It doesn't make sense,
him doing this.

13:04.653 --> 13:06.046
I mean, the guy was a genius.

13:06.089 --> 13:08.309
Oh, he's the "Get out
of my face" guy?

13:08.352 --> 13:11.268
Yeah, he's the "Get
out of my face" guy,

13:11.312 --> 13:12.792
but he's got
a lot more bits than that.

13:12.835 --> 13:13.923
[knocks on door]

13:13.967 --> 13:15.446
One of the greats.

13:18.493 --> 13:20.190
I did not order a pizza.

13:20.234 --> 13:22.845
Huh. Already
with the jokes.

13:22.889 --> 13:24.499
I'm Detective Reagan,

13:24.542 --> 13:25.674
this is my partner,
Detective Baez.

13:25.717 --> 13:26.893
Do you have a minute for a word?

13:26.936 --> 13:28.982
Hell, I got all year.

13:30.548 --> 13:32.376
Can I get you a coffee
or a bourbon?

13:32.420 --> 13:34.552
Or some Schedule II narcotics?

13:34.596 --> 13:36.032
Excuse me?

13:36.076 --> 13:38.992
I'm kidding.
I don't actually have coffee.

13:39.035 --> 13:41.037
You know, I went
to that show right there.

13:41.081 --> 13:42.560
You mind telling me
what you're doing here?

13:42.604 --> 13:44.171
BAEZ:Mr. Fells, on
Tuesday night

13:44.214 --> 13:45.868
at the Comedy Shop,
you tried to pull

13:45.912 --> 13:47.870
a female comic
off the stage?

13:47.914 --> 13:50.917
That vapid hack?
I did that crowd a favor.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.701
We're here trying
to get an understanding

13:52.744 --> 13:56.096
of what happened at the comedy
club the night Doc was murdered.

13:57.097 --> 13:58.750
Doc's dead?

13:58.794 --> 14:00.448
Uh-- It's all
over the papers.

14:00.491 --> 14:02.885
I black out sometimes.

14:02.929 --> 14:04.931
I just woke up now
when you guys knocked.

14:09.761 --> 14:11.894
I can't believe Doc's dead.

14:11.938 --> 14:13.548
Really? After she
had you thrown out?

14:13.591 --> 14:16.899
Wait a minute,
did you guys show me a warrant?

14:16.943 --> 14:18.553
You invited us in, remember?

14:18.596 --> 14:19.946
Do we need a warrant?

14:19.989 --> 14:22.035
No, you need to leave.

14:22.078 --> 14:24.428
You know, it's weird, you
say you black out sometimes,

14:24.472 --> 14:25.429
yet you remember

14:25.473 --> 14:26.343
that Ricki Blanton

14:26.387 --> 14:27.692
was a "vapid hack."

14:27.736 --> 14:29.520
Get out of my face.

14:29.564 --> 14:31.783
[chuckles] You're gonna
use your tagline on us?

14:33.089 --> 14:34.743
I'm serious. I want my lawyer.

14:34.786 --> 14:36.527
Okay.

14:36.571 --> 14:38.878
We will see you again,
Mr. Fells.

14:39.835 --> 14:40.531
Great.

14:49.932 --> 14:52.021
Hey. Anything
from the security cameras

14:52.065 --> 14:53.588
outside the Comedy Shop?

14:53.631 --> 14:56.199
No, there was just one in the
back alley, picked up squat.

14:56.243 --> 14:57.940
[sighs]
What about inside?

14:57.984 --> 15:01.074
Don't audiences film with
their cell phones these days?

15:01.117 --> 15:02.945
Usually, but not in this club,

15:02.989 --> 15:06.253
because the comics don't want
their acts being leaked, so...

15:06.296 --> 15:09.256
Well, time for you to work some
of that old Danny Reagan magic

15:09.299 --> 15:11.432
and find us a new way
to nail Emmett Fells.

15:11.475 --> 15:13.434
Yeah, except I'm not
sure he's our guy.

15:13.477 --> 15:15.349
What? Excuse me?

15:15.392 --> 15:17.264
Weren't you in that
same smelly apartment

15:17.307 --> 15:19.440
with that half-plastered guy

15:19.483 --> 15:21.659
with that bathrobe
that wouldn't quite close?

15:21.703 --> 15:23.313
Yeah, I was there, but,
you know, it kind of sounds

15:23.357 --> 15:25.054
like maybe you just
don't like him.

15:25.098 --> 15:26.751
[exhales]
I like him for this.

15:26.795 --> 15:28.928
Okay, well, did you know
that Doc's landlords

15:28.971 --> 15:31.669
don't like her, and her
employees don't like her

15:31.713 --> 15:33.845
because she only
pays minimum wage?

15:33.889 --> 15:35.412
And her comics
don't even like her

15:35.456 --> 15:37.153
'cause she's playing
gatekeeper with their careers.

15:37.197 --> 15:39.721
Danny, this is our guy.

15:39.764 --> 15:41.418
Well, not until we can rule out

15:41.462 --> 15:43.812
the other million possibilities
in this city.

15:43.855 --> 15:46.293
You know what?
Knock yourself out.

15:46.336 --> 15:49.731
Okay. I will.

15:51.341 --> 15:55.171
Woman's name is
Jill Camargo, 46.

15:55.215 --> 15:57.652
Apparently a model citizen

15:57.695 --> 16:00.960
until seven years ago,
when she dropped off the grid.

16:04.354 --> 16:06.530
My sense is Jamie knows why.

16:07.705 --> 16:09.533
Well, that's when
the collars started.

16:09.577 --> 16:11.144
22 and counting.

16:11.187 --> 16:12.493
Drug offenses,
disorderly conduct.

16:12.536 --> 16:14.321
How many are Jamie's?

16:14.364 --> 16:15.496
Six.

16:15.539 --> 16:16.845
In the last three years.

16:16.888 --> 16:18.673
And like he said, no felonies.

16:18.716 --> 16:20.849
Except for shoving
Officer Valle.

16:20.892 --> 16:23.243
Well, we don't really know
she did that.

16:23.286 --> 16:24.592
Actually, we do.

16:25.897 --> 16:27.247
We have his body
cam footage.

16:27.290 --> 16:29.771
I mean, I've ignored
abuse worse than that,

16:29.814 --> 16:32.078
but for a cop new to the street?

16:33.079 --> 16:34.210
[sighs]

16:34.254 --> 16:35.646
Yeah.

16:35.690 --> 16:37.126
Especially if your partner
doesn't have your back.

16:37.170 --> 16:39.955
Which is how it's playing out
on the precinct level.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.783
And in the mayor's office.

16:43.306 --> 16:44.873
You're kidding me.

16:44.916 --> 16:46.875
And they know that how?

16:46.918 --> 16:48.877
The deputy chief of staff
mentioned it to me,

16:48.920 --> 16:52.533
just a "hey, by the way,"
in a scheduling meeting.

16:52.576 --> 16:54.665
Apparently, they've
been keeping their eye

16:54.709 --> 16:56.537
on Valle since the academy.

16:56.580 --> 16:59.018
Top grades,
compassionate, diverse,

16:59.061 --> 17:01.237
the whole "new breed of cop"
trailer.

17:01.281 --> 17:02.891
What's wrong with the old breed?

17:02.934 --> 17:05.111
Sid, find a mirror now.

17:06.503 --> 17:08.810
Boss, it's other people
making hay of this.

17:08.853 --> 17:10.725
Valle is just hurt.

17:10.768 --> 17:13.336
Till the other day,
he and Jamie were peas in a pod.

17:14.381 --> 17:16.252
Yeah, well, now it's today.

17:17.253 --> 17:18.776
So talk to your son again.

17:18.820 --> 17:21.388
He's said all he's gonna say.

17:21.431 --> 17:23.999
You can be very persuasive.

17:24.043 --> 17:25.914
Not when he gets like this.

17:25.957 --> 17:28.177
That's years
of experience talking.

17:29.135 --> 17:30.397
Call Erin.

17:30.440 --> 17:32.181
This all started
a complaint review.

17:34.096 --> 17:36.446
I've been trying
not to do that.

17:38.796 --> 17:41.495
No. This goes one way
and one way only.

17:45.673 --> 17:47.283
DANNY:
Very brave of you, Ricki,

17:47.327 --> 17:49.068
getting back up
on the stage so quickly

17:49.111 --> 17:50.678
after what happened to you.

17:50.721 --> 17:53.594
Hi? I'm emceeing a benefit
in Doc's name tonight.

17:53.637 --> 17:55.596
Trying to keep this place
from going under.

17:55.639 --> 17:58.251
Very cool.
Uh, I'm Detective Reagan.

17:58.294 --> 17:59.861
You have a second to talk?

17:59.904 --> 18:01.036
Yeah.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.516
So you want

18:02.559 --> 18:04.257
me to say Emmett Fells
is a monster

18:04.300 --> 18:06.085
for throwing me off this stage?

18:06.128 --> 18:07.695
So he did attack you.

18:07.738 --> 18:09.305
I got his slot.

18:09.349 --> 18:12.569
He probably saw his career
flash before his eyes.

18:12.613 --> 18:13.831
But, uh, till the other night,

18:13.875 --> 18:15.268
Emmett's always
treated me right.

18:15.311 --> 18:16.965
Interesting.
He told my partner and I

18:17.008 --> 18:19.315
that you were a hack.

18:19.359 --> 18:21.448
Compared to him,
we all kind of are.

18:21.491 --> 18:23.014
True.Besides,

18:23.058 --> 18:26.279
trade secret: most comics
are pretty screwed up.

18:26.322 --> 18:27.454
I mean, when he grabbed me,
I was doing a bit

18:27.497 --> 18:28.890
about how stupid

18:28.933 --> 18:30.718
kids are and how
they ought to be outlawed.

18:30.761 --> 18:32.198
Uh, speaking of him
grabbing you,

18:32.241 --> 18:33.677
did he say anything

18:33.721 --> 18:36.158
might let you
know why he did?

18:36.202 --> 18:39.205
No, only to Doc
after she threw him out.

18:39.248 --> 18:41.642
But again, he was drunk.

18:41.685 --> 18:43.818
Well, what did he say to Doc?
Do you know?

18:43.861 --> 18:46.647
That he was gonna
"make her pay."

18:46.690 --> 18:48.301
It seemed like
an empty threat.

18:48.344 --> 18:52.000
So I left.
I went to a party uptown.

18:52.043 --> 18:54.829
But I guess his threat
wasn't empty after all.

18:54.872 --> 18:57.484
Okay, well, thank you.

18:57.527 --> 18:59.007
And good luck with the benefit.

18:59.050 --> 19:00.313
You gonna stick around?

19:00.356 --> 19:01.836
No. I got work to do.

19:01.879 --> 19:03.620
Lots of laughs.Thanks.

19:03.664 --> 19:05.318
So?

19:05.361 --> 19:08.190
So I thought you didn't
want to come with.

19:08.234 --> 19:10.801
I want to hear
who your new suspect is.

19:10.845 --> 19:13.674
Well, based on my conversations
with everyone here,

19:13.717 --> 19:17.547
and talking to Ricki,
apparently it is Emmett Fells.

19:17.591 --> 19:19.549
Hmm. So I was right.

19:19.593 --> 19:22.117
No, we still have to
talk to the landlords.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.380
Oh, come on, Reagan,
what is it with you?

19:24.424 --> 19:26.034
What...?Are you so starstruck

19:26.077 --> 19:27.340
that you can't see
that Emmett is our guy?I'm...

19:27.383 --> 19:29.385
Hold on, I'm not
starstruck, okay?

19:29.429 --> 19:31.213
So you lost your edge?

19:31.257 --> 19:34.869
No. Look, I don't care how
much I like the guy's comedy.

19:34.912 --> 19:37.567
I'm gonna pinch him like
I would any other murderer.

19:37.611 --> 19:39.308
But you just can't see it yet.

19:39.352 --> 19:42.616
No, what I see is
circumstantial evidence so far.

19:42.659 --> 19:45.271
You saying this as a cop
or as a fan?

19:45.314 --> 19:49.623
[scoffs] Okay, look, yes,
Linda and I went to his show

19:49.666 --> 19:52.321
on one of our first dates,
and we had a great time.

19:54.018 --> 19:55.368
I never saw her laugh like that.

19:55.411 --> 19:57.370
That doesn't mean
I won't do my job.

19:57.413 --> 19:59.285
You just don't want
to ruin the memory.

20:00.416 --> 20:01.983
I guess not.

20:04.768 --> 20:06.814
[horn blows in distance]

20:12.428 --> 20:15.910
[grunts, shouts]

20:15.953 --> 20:17.259
JANKO:
Now finish the job.

20:17.303 --> 20:19.740
Throw yourself in, too.

20:19.783 --> 20:22.569
Fine, I'm a janitor.
What, are you here to gloat?

20:22.612 --> 20:24.266
I'm just here to tell you
I'm not gonna be

20:24.310 --> 20:25.833
a part of that investigation.

20:25.876 --> 20:27.095
I swear, I brought this
to you guys

20:27.138 --> 20:28.923
out of the goodness of my heart.

20:28.966 --> 20:30.098
Lie.

20:30.141 --> 20:32.622
You got to believe me.Lie.

20:32.666 --> 20:34.276
You can really trust me.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.278
Lie. Lie. Lie.

20:36.322 --> 20:37.584
You know what,
Voorhees?

20:37.627 --> 20:39.325
You're always gonna be a liar.

20:40.804 --> 20:41.936
A-All right, okay.

20:41.979 --> 20:43.459
There's-there's an angle.

20:43.503 --> 20:46.288
[laughs softly]
What?

20:46.332 --> 20:48.334
I need a job.

20:48.377 --> 20:49.944
You have a job.

20:49.987 --> 20:52.294
There's a security firm
in Queens.

20:52.338 --> 20:54.949
They hire a lot
of ex-law enforcement.

20:54.992 --> 20:56.603
The guy there likes me.

20:56.646 --> 20:58.213
Then he pulled up
your arrest record.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.475
He says I need

20:59.519 --> 21:00.955
a recommendation
from someone solid.

21:00.998 --> 21:03.305
It was gonna be Anthony.
But coming from you?

21:03.349 --> 21:05.046
The cop that busted me?
That'd go so much further.

21:05.089 --> 21:08.484
But I know you don't like me
and you don't trust me.

21:08.528 --> 21:10.878
Well, that's the understatement
of the year.

21:12.401 --> 21:15.143
I'm trying to learn
how to be a good person.

21:15.186 --> 21:16.884
For the first time in my life.

21:18.364 --> 21:20.148
Please help me do that.

21:20.191 --> 21:22.237
If we land
Hobbs, you...

21:22.281 --> 21:25.284
you got to say I've changed.

21:25.327 --> 21:27.286
That I'm someone you can trust.

21:33.727 --> 21:35.337
Hey, Officer Valle.

21:35.381 --> 21:37.034
Hey, you banged
in sick yesterday.

21:37.078 --> 21:38.253
Yeah, I'm fine.

21:38.297 --> 21:39.646
Just took the day.

21:39.689 --> 21:41.517
Good to hear.
Is it?

21:41.561 --> 21:43.345
Or do you think I'm lying,
like I did about that woman?

21:43.389 --> 21:44.868
I didn't call you a liar.

21:44.912 --> 21:46.435
I asked what was going on,
you said you'd handle it,

21:46.479 --> 21:48.742
and then you went and
back-stabbed me to that A.D.A.,

21:48.785 --> 21:50.047
all over some crazy bag lady?

21:50.091 --> 21:51.266
Hey, don't call her that.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.659
Then what is she?

21:52.702 --> 21:54.225
Look, boss, I-I...

21:54.269 --> 21:56.227
I know I'm green and all,
and you're a Reagan...

21:56.271 --> 21:57.707
What does that have
to do with anything?

21:57.751 --> 21:59.535
What, in this department,
are you joking?

21:59.579 --> 22:01.668
All right, look, that's enough,
Officer Valle.

22:01.711 --> 22:03.670
Oh, so that's how you "maintain
your higher level of dignity"?

22:03.713 --> 22:05.367
You need to stop.You pull rank when someone
calls you out?

22:05.411 --> 22:07.021
Back off, right now!

22:07.064 --> 22:08.414
You gonna hit me like she did?

22:09.415 --> 22:11.591
Is there a problem,
gentlemen?

22:11.634 --> 22:13.244
Nothing, sir.

22:14.681 --> 22:16.422
Just a friendly
disagreement, boss.

22:16.465 --> 22:18.119
Well, Valle,
you get to work.

22:19.860 --> 22:21.427
And, Reagan, you go home.

22:21.470 --> 22:23.385
My shift's not over
for another two hours, boss.

22:23.429 --> 22:25.518
You're suspended
on direct orders of the PC.

22:25.561 --> 22:27.215
Gun and shield.

22:49.933 --> 22:52.545
DANNY: It's sad, the guy had
everything going for him-- fame,

22:52.588 --> 22:55.461
money, success and...
just blew it.

22:55.504 --> 22:56.418
It's tragic.

22:56.462 --> 22:58.202
A wise man once said,

22:58.246 --> 22:59.856
"Life's not meant to be fair,

22:59.900 --> 23:01.205
only eventful."

23:01.249 --> 23:02.685
What wise man was that?

23:02.729 --> 23:03.730
You're looking at him.

23:03.773 --> 23:05.122
[Danny laughs]

23:05.166 --> 23:07.908
Maybe that explains
why I got suspended.

23:09.736 --> 23:11.694
Are we missing
something?

23:11.738 --> 23:13.130
No, I did what I had to do.

23:13.174 --> 23:14.697
And some people above me
disagreed.

23:14.741 --> 23:16.612
I got suspended.
End of story.

23:16.656 --> 23:19.049
You know, I never liked that
CO of yours, uh, Espinoza...

23:19.093 --> 23:21.791
His CO didn't do it.

23:21.835 --> 23:24.228
Okay.

23:24.272 --> 23:28.276
Either of you want to
explain what happened?

23:28.319 --> 23:29.712
Nope.

23:29.756 --> 23:31.148
Not really.

23:31.192 --> 23:33.890
So now we're keeping secrets?

23:33.934 --> 23:35.152
Like most families?

23:35.196 --> 23:36.719
Oh, cut it out.

23:36.763 --> 23:38.417
You never kept anything
from the rest of us, Dad?

23:38.460 --> 23:39.896
Nothing important.

23:39.940 --> 23:41.332
Well, wouldn't we have
to know what it is

23:41.376 --> 23:42.551
to know whether or not
it's important?

23:42.595 --> 23:44.379
Now you're arguing transparency.

23:44.423 --> 23:45.902
JAMIE: I'm just saying I think
a guy has a right to keep

23:45.946 --> 23:47.251
his own counsel
once in a while around here.

23:47.295 --> 23:48.470
Even in this tribe.

23:48.514 --> 23:50.298
DANNY: You now,
not for nothing,

23:50.341 --> 23:53.606
a few moments ago,
both of you said you were fine

23:53.649 --> 23:56.347
with whatever it is that's going
on that none of us know about.

23:56.391 --> 23:57.697
I am fine.

23:59.350 --> 24:00.351
Me, too.

24:00.395 --> 24:01.962
Could have fooled me.

24:02.005 --> 24:04.704
I agree with Jamie.

24:04.747 --> 24:07.184
Of course.

24:08.534 --> 24:11.275
I just mean
we-we try to be honest

24:11.319 --> 24:13.060
around this table,
but we don't need

24:13.103 --> 24:15.366
to be honest about everything.

24:15.410 --> 24:16.411
Like what?

24:16.455 --> 24:17.760
Yeah, you can't chicken out now.

24:17.804 --> 24:18.892
Like what?

24:20.807 --> 24:22.635
Meatloaf.

24:22.678 --> 24:23.984
It stays with me
for a few days.

24:24.027 --> 24:26.508
And not in a good way.

24:26.552 --> 24:28.205
That's what it's supposed to do.

24:28.249 --> 24:30.643
Fortifies you
for the week ahead.

24:30.686 --> 24:32.253
Well, thanks for sharing.

24:32.296 --> 24:34.168
And that English essay
that I told you I aced?

24:34.211 --> 24:35.517
Yeah?
A better word

24:35.561 --> 24:37.171
would be "bombed."

24:37.214 --> 24:39.347
DANNY: Okay, better
than cheating.

24:39.390 --> 24:42.393
SEAN:
Now you, can't chicken out.

24:42.437 --> 24:44.831
DANNY: Sometimes
I like to go off

24:44.874 --> 24:46.572
on Erin just for sport.

24:47.660 --> 24:51.098
But I also think she's
very good at what she does.

24:51.141 --> 24:52.534
JANKO:
Oh, see?

24:52.578 --> 24:54.188
Positive secret, positive.DANNY: Well...

24:54.231 --> 24:56.016
Yeah!
DANNY:
That's right.

24:56.059 --> 24:57.104
You go.

24:57.147 --> 24:58.758
You should really put

24:58.801 --> 25:00.542
that sweater out of its misery.

25:00.586 --> 25:01.717
DANNY:
You're the one
that gave it to me!

25:01.761 --> 25:03.284
Two Christmases ago!

25:03.327 --> 25:04.720
Well, I obviously

25:04.764 --> 25:06.548
was mad at you when I bought it.

25:06.592 --> 25:07.854
DANNY:
Wow.

25:07.897 --> 25:08.985
Thanks.

25:10.465 --> 25:12.119
Jamison?

25:12.162 --> 25:14.208
I guess I thought we all agreed

25:14.251 --> 25:15.862
that trust was
a two-way street around here.

25:15.905 --> 25:17.559
I was wrong.

25:17.603 --> 25:20.388
Took the words
right out of my mouth.

25:21.911 --> 25:23.957
[quietly]:
Mm, well...

25:40.626 --> 25:42.497
Why'd you do it?

25:42.541 --> 25:44.325
Because she took
your spot?

25:44.368 --> 25:46.283
'Cause she threw
you out, what?

25:46.327 --> 25:47.894
No comment.

25:47.937 --> 25:50.592
"No comment" or "I'm too
hungover to comment"?

25:50.636 --> 25:52.463
And that was uncalled for.

25:52.507 --> 25:55.205
Mr. Fells, you attacked
Ricki Blanton.

25:55.249 --> 25:57.512
You threatened Ms. Pressly.

25:57.556 --> 25:59.819
Save the D.A.
the hassle of going to trial,

25:59.862 --> 26:01.995
you may get yourself
a more favorable sentence.

26:02.038 --> 26:04.301
No comment.
DANNY: All right,
knock it off

26:04.345 --> 26:06.260
with the "no comment"
already, okay?

26:06.303 --> 26:08.001
It's not funny!
Nothing's funny...

26:08.044 --> 26:09.263
Are you going
to arrest my client?

26:09.306 --> 26:10.917
Yeah, he's gonna
arrest me!

26:10.960 --> 26:13.267
Emmett, shut up...No, he's right!

26:13.310 --> 26:14.442
What'd you do, Emmett?

26:14.485 --> 26:15.617
Emmett.

26:15.661 --> 26:16.749
Say the words, Emmett.

26:16.792 --> 26:17.924
Not one more word...

26:17.967 --> 26:19.447
What the hell did you do,
Emmett?!

26:19.490 --> 26:21.449
I attacked Ricki and I went back
and I killed Doc!

26:21.492 --> 26:22.972
You hear me? I did it!

26:25.061 --> 26:26.497
And you remember all this?

26:27.498 --> 26:29.544
Some of it's a blur.

26:31.328 --> 26:33.940
But I hated Ricki
for being up there.

26:33.983 --> 26:36.333
And I wanted Doc dead
for kicking me out.

26:37.378 --> 26:39.336
Seems like
all I ever do anymore

26:39.380 --> 26:41.991
is let people down.

26:42.035 --> 26:44.820
Well, now you're under arrest.

26:45.908 --> 26:47.693
Mr. Fells, you're under arrest

26:47.736 --> 26:49.259
for the murder
of Elaine Pressly.

26:49.303 --> 26:51.522
Please stand up and put your
hands behind your back.

26:56.092 --> 26:57.441
[knocking at door]

26:57.485 --> 26:59.530
[grunts]

27:03.709 --> 27:05.145
Oh.

27:05.188 --> 27:06.799
Hey.

27:06.842 --> 27:08.496
Well, I wasn't expecting
a brass band,

27:08.539 --> 27:10.019
but "hey"?

27:10.063 --> 27:11.673
That's all you got?

27:11.717 --> 27:13.849
Sorry, Pop. Come on in.

27:13.893 --> 27:15.634
No, you come out.

27:15.677 --> 27:17.853
There's a, there's a,
a new coffee joint a block over

27:17.897 --> 27:20.943
that I want to try--
Java The Hut.

27:20.987 --> 27:23.163
Star Trekreference.

27:23.206 --> 27:24.991
Star Wars.

27:25.034 --> 27:26.383
And you didn't come for coffee.

27:26.427 --> 27:27.558
Dad sent you.

27:27.602 --> 27:28.690
Says who?

27:28.734 --> 27:30.431
A lifetime of knowing him.

27:30.474 --> 27:32.999
Is his nose out of joint
because one of his cops

27:33.042 --> 27:35.001
won't come clean? Sure.

27:35.044 --> 27:37.090
But he's really more worried

27:37.133 --> 27:39.440
about a son
who won't talk to him.

27:39.483 --> 27:41.268
Could you just let it go?

27:41.311 --> 27:43.357
Ah, you're making
a mistake, kid.

27:43.400 --> 27:45.098
If I am...

27:45.141 --> 27:47.187
then I'll survive.

27:47.230 --> 27:49.798
It's not about this woman,
whoever she is.

27:49.842 --> 27:52.627
It's about shutting us out.

27:52.671 --> 27:55.064
Look, I know we can all be

27:55.108 --> 27:57.023
a bunch of Nosey Nancys.

27:57.066 --> 28:00.069
But a family is a resource
like no other.

28:00.113 --> 28:03.638
Lifetimes of experience on tap.

28:03.682 --> 28:06.249
From people who...

28:06.293 --> 28:09.383
are willing to listen to you
with an open heart.

28:09.426 --> 28:12.299
Can you just go, Pop?

28:13.604 --> 28:16.129
So you're slamming the door
in my face, too?

28:17.783 --> 28:19.567
Not even the Star Trekcoffee?

28:19.610 --> 28:22.396
Another day, okay?

28:22.439 --> 28:23.963
[stammers]

28:36.279 --> 28:38.064
VOORHEES:
So where's the wire?

28:38.107 --> 28:39.674
It's a manner of speech.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.763
These days we use an app
that connects to Bluetooth

28:41.807 --> 28:44.244
and that connects my mic
and my earpiece.

28:44.287 --> 28:45.985
Oh.Yeah.

28:46.028 --> 28:47.769
You wanted to help run it
down her shirt, didn't you?

28:47.813 --> 28:49.902
I was just trying to help.

28:49.945 --> 28:51.773
Give him a break, Anthony.Oh!

28:51.817 --> 28:53.775
Now you're gonna be soft
on the guy?
No.

28:53.819 --> 28:55.298
I just want to get this done.

28:55.342 --> 28:56.778
Yeah, for that we need Hobbs.

28:56.822 --> 28:58.824
Who said he'd arrive at 4:00.

28:58.867 --> 29:01.000
It's now a quarter past.

29:01.043 --> 29:02.479
He said he'd be here, I swear!

29:02.523 --> 29:03.785
Yeah, and if he doesn't,

29:03.829 --> 29:04.830
it's your ass, pal,
I'm telling you.

29:11.314 --> 29:13.621
[indistinct chatter]

29:13.664 --> 29:15.579
FRANK:
How you doing, Jill?

29:20.846 --> 29:22.848
[chair scraping]

29:29.637 --> 29:31.726
You're Jamie's dad.

29:31.770 --> 29:34.555
Don't worry, Jamie
kept his word to you.

29:34.598 --> 29:37.558
But if he didn't say anything...

29:39.168 --> 29:42.476
One of your booking
pictures showed a tattoo.

29:43.912 --> 29:46.654
Well, see...

29:46.697 --> 29:48.743
I'm a Marine, too.

29:52.878 --> 29:55.489
So I did some checking.

29:55.532 --> 29:58.013
Combat Battalion 1,

29:58.057 --> 30:00.886
1st Marines Logistics Group.

30:03.497 --> 30:06.282
And it turns out,
that's the unit that supported

30:06.326 --> 30:09.633
my son Danny's company
in Fallujah.

30:11.026 --> 30:12.985
I was driving lead vehicle

30:13.028 --> 30:16.162
in the convoy
when an IED went off.

30:17.903 --> 30:20.993
Blown clear out of the cab.

30:21.036 --> 30:23.865
Before I knew it,
they were on us.

30:23.909 --> 30:25.954
Danny was next to me.

30:31.307 --> 30:33.483
Tough fight.

30:36.835 --> 30:40.273
The after-action report said
you gave 'em hell.

30:41.622 --> 30:43.929
Jamie knew about that, too.

30:43.972 --> 30:47.106
It's how he recognized
my name first time we met.

30:47.149 --> 30:49.848
He's been looking out
for me ever since.

30:49.891 --> 30:51.284
God knows why.

30:52.459 --> 30:54.635
God does know why.

30:57.420 --> 30:59.248
You're a hero.

30:59.292 --> 31:01.337
Some hero.

31:03.731 --> 31:05.776
Look at me.

31:09.519 --> 31:11.565
I see you.

31:13.697 --> 31:16.744
I see the hero
that kept my son Danny alive.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.575
And so does Jamie.

31:41.682 --> 31:44.641
Hey, it's all done, finished.

31:44.685 --> 31:46.774
Just turned Emmett over
to Central Booking.

31:46.817 --> 31:48.080
Except it isn't.

31:48.123 --> 31:49.516
What are you talking about?

31:49.559 --> 31:51.387
Emmett gave us
a false confession.

31:51.431 --> 31:53.259
[laughs] Oh,
come on, seriously?

31:53.302 --> 31:55.304
I told you I didn't
like him for this.

31:55.348 --> 31:57.828
And now I finally come on
board to your way of thinking,

31:57.872 --> 31:59.569
and you're jumping ship?

31:59.613 --> 32:01.963
Well, you remember in the box,
when Emmett kept stonewalling us

32:02.007 --> 32:04.052
until you brought up
that he let his fans down?

32:04.096 --> 32:06.402
No, I didn't say that,
hesaid that.

32:06.446 --> 32:08.230
I merely broke a perp.

32:08.274 --> 32:10.363
Well, Emmett took it further
and said that

32:10.406 --> 32:11.799
he let everyone down.

32:11.842 --> 32:13.235
Okay...Did you know that he had

32:13.279 --> 32:14.671
a four-year-old daughter
in Ohio?

32:14.715 --> 32:16.195
Yeah, Natalie.

32:16.238 --> 32:18.197
Um, she was conceived
on a one-night stand

32:18.240 --> 32:19.546
when he was on tour.

32:19.589 --> 32:20.764
He tweets about her
all the time,

32:20.808 --> 32:22.157
says she's the light
of his life. So?

32:22.201 --> 32:24.725
Except he stopped tweeting
about her a year ago

32:24.768 --> 32:27.075
when he drunkenly
crashed his car

32:27.119 --> 32:29.773
with her in the back seat.Oh, okay, yeah.

32:29.817 --> 32:32.037
He never tweeted about that.

32:32.080 --> 32:34.996
Or the order of protection
her mother filed against him.

32:35.040 --> 32:38.130
Reagan, Emmett started
spiraling the moment

32:38.173 --> 32:39.870
he couldn't see Natalie anymore.

32:39.914 --> 32:43.309
And his-his career
just fell apart.

32:43.352 --> 32:45.093
And then Ricki, the other night,
made those comments

32:45.137 --> 32:46.790
about little kids.

32:46.834 --> 32:48.618
So what you're saying is

32:48.662 --> 32:51.970
because he's constantly
blacked out and hates Doc

32:52.013 --> 32:55.669
and himself so much
that he just assumed

32:55.712 --> 32:57.932
that he killed Doc.

32:57.976 --> 33:00.108
Exactly.

33:00.152 --> 33:03.068
So if not him, it must be
one of those other

33:03.111 --> 33:06.723
million possibilities
that I suggested before, huh?

33:08.334 --> 33:10.205
I just keep getting
his voice mail.

33:10.249 --> 33:11.815
Or you been jerking our chain
this whole time.

33:11.859 --> 33:13.904
And I believed you.

33:16.037 --> 33:19.040
Wait, there-- there he is.

33:19.084 --> 33:21.042
EDDIE:
Ah. Well, you failed to mention

33:21.086 --> 33:22.609
that he's built like Bigfoot.

33:22.652 --> 33:24.567
We just need him to offer
leniency for sex

33:24.611 --> 33:25.829
and I'll be there in a flash.

33:25.873 --> 33:29.007
Okay. I'm going in.

33:31.096 --> 33:32.097
Hey.

33:33.228 --> 33:34.969
Good luck.

33:43.108 --> 33:44.152
Mr. Hobbs?

33:44.196 --> 33:45.936
Pam Toner.

33:45.980 --> 33:50.985
So I hear that you're friends
with Don Voorhees.

33:51.029 --> 33:53.988
What, you want to be
my friend?Sure.

33:54.032 --> 33:55.424
I'll be your friend.

33:55.468 --> 33:58.297
Hey, yo, let me get two pints.

33:58.340 --> 34:00.168
You got it, buddy.

34:01.256 --> 34:05.565
So, my boyfriend
is in prison.

34:05.608 --> 34:07.784
He gets out soon,

34:07.828 --> 34:09.612
but I'd do anything

34:09.656 --> 34:12.093
to help make his life
a little easier.

34:12.137 --> 34:14.052
I like the sound of "anything."

34:15.879 --> 34:18.186
I can't get any service in here.

34:19.666 --> 34:23.017
HOBBS:
How many bars you got?
Hmm? Let me see.

34:23.061 --> 34:24.279
Oh, I don't really...

34:24.323 --> 34:26.803
Let me see this.Oh, hey...

HOBBS:
You know, I know Voorhees
is a dick,

34:29.023 --> 34:31.852
But I didn't take him for this.What?

34:35.203 --> 34:36.509
What?

34:36.552 --> 34:37.640
We just lost...What's going on?

34:37.684 --> 34:39.642
Is he onto her?

34:39.686 --> 34:41.688
Why did you throw my phone
in some beer? That's crazy.

34:41.731 --> 34:43.472
Yeah, I don't know.

call the cops.

you brought me in here?

arrested, and Doc said

36:40.285 --> 36:41.329
you just needed help.

36:41.373 --> 36:42.939
She was right about that.

37:03.177 --> 37:07.225
After we told her we checked
her social media accounts

37:07.268 --> 37:10.402

the photos she took with fans,

at the comedy club
