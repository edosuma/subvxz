WEBVTT

00:46.658 --> 00:48.317
I just can't believe that you've done that.

00:48.385 --> 00:50.282
I got a court order and I followed it.

00:50.519 --> 00:51.874
You violated protocol.

00:52.077 --> 00:54.041
When I was in patrol,
we did what we were told.

00:54.550 --> 00:56.141
You're not in patrol anymore.

01:13.796 --> 01:15.083
Hey.

01:15.117 --> 01:16.540
Yeah. Hey, hey.

01:18.470 --> 01:19.893
Come here.

01:20.706 --> 01:22.500
All units, I've got a 315 in progress.

01:22.501 --> 01:25.414
Officer needs assistance. I'm at the
Biscayne Courthouse on Flagler.

01:38.334 --> 01:39.756
Do you remember me ?

01:39.418 --> 01:40.773
No.

02:00.114 --> 02:01.435
Brad !

02:02.767 --> 02:04.077
Don't do it !

02:18.965 --> 02:19.692
Calleigh ?

02:20.003 --> 02:20.724
Calleigh ?

02:23.542 --> 02:24.984
Oh my god. Calleigh ?

02:39.910 --> 02:42.506
Horatio Caine?
You know where Horatio Caine is?

02:43.443 --> 02:44.753
You're Horatio Caine ?

02:45.171 --> 02:46.932
- Speaking.
- You run the crime lab ?

02:47.045 --> 02:48.410
I run my shift. And you are ?

02:48.411 --> 02:49.979
Brad Manning. I got a case coming up

02:49.980 --> 02:51.685
in court today at 4:00.

02:51.793 --> 02:53.983
Mr. Manning, I'm not allowed
to discuss that with you.

02:54.062 --> 02:55.291
I love my little girl.

02:55.292 --> 02:56.873
I would never do anything to hurt her.

02:57.324 --> 02:59.955
I want to thank you for
everything that you've done.

03:01.847 --> 03:03.202
I'm just doing my job.

03:03.428 --> 03:05.245
I just want to protect my little girl.

03:05.674 --> 03:08.077
I believe you, but that is
a matter for the judge.

03:10.061 --> 03:11.574
See, that's the problem.

03:11.868 --> 03:13.651
They always rule for the woman.

03:13.742 --> 03:15.243
My ex-- she's crazy.

03:15.509 --> 03:16.864
He stole my daughter.

03:17.746 --> 03:19.507
Please don't let him take her away.

03:19.872 --> 03:21.494
Well, I can't make any promises,

03:21.920 --> 03:23.631
but I think you have got a good case.

03:23.945 --> 03:25.227
This is it.

03:25.228 --> 03:27.207
It's the end of the line for me.
Do you understand ?

03:27.207 --> 03:28.398
I understand.

03:28.612 --> 03:31.408
- You said 4:00 today ?
- That's right. 4:00

03:31.530 --> 03:32.813
today.

03:34.015 --> 03:35.336
You gonna be there ?

03:36.242 --> 03:37.613
I am now.

04:26.429 --> 04:28.013
Horatio, I just got a callout on a jumper

04:28.014 --> 04:29.385
in Miami Shores. You heading out ?

04:29.624 --> 04:32.340
Would you mind taking Eric, Frank ?
I'm working on something else.

04:32.341 --> 04:33.049
What's the case ?

04:33.096 --> 04:35.159
It's a child abuse case with allegations

04:35.159 --> 04:37.808
from both parents and there's a pretrial hearing today.

04:37.921 --> 04:40.349
Yeah, well, I've heard that old song before. "He said, she said."

04:40.588 --> 04:41.958
Yes.

04:41.959 --> 04:43.997
The problem is is that the child

04:44.469 --> 04:46.218
ends up paying the price.

04:46.897 --> 04:48.670
Yeah, well, you can't make people

04:48.671 --> 04:51.399
- be good parents.
- No, we can't, but we can make sure

04:51.400 --> 04:53.627
we never get a callout
on this little girl.

05:12.923 --> 05:14.269
Thank you, ma'am.

05:18.962 --> 05:20.270
That...

05:22.031 --> 05:23.465
That looks like a good book.

05:24.685 --> 05:26.107
It's about a talking cat.

05:27.637 --> 05:29.951
- Have you read it ?
- No, I haven't.

05:30.743 --> 05:31.865
I have.

05:31.976 --> 05:33.309
Twice.

05:33.473 --> 05:34.781
But I still like it.

05:42.399 --> 05:43.732
You're a policeman, aren't you ?

05:44.046 --> 05:45.531
That's right. How did you know ?

05:45.996 --> 05:47.670
You look like all the other ones.

05:47.785 --> 05:49.131
Except for the red hair.

05:52.490 --> 05:54.023
You've spoken to a lot of police officers

05:54.024 --> 05:55.420
lately, haven't you, Amy ?

05:56.648 --> 05:58.447
They asked me lots of questions

05:59.176 --> 06:00.547
about my mom and dad.

06:00.560 --> 06:01.868
What'd you tell them ?

06:04.308 --> 06:05.667
That they argued a lot.

06:06.379 --> 06:08.341
I tried to make them stop,
but they didn't.

06:09.133 --> 06:11.723
Now I have to go to court
and not tell any lies.

06:12.303 --> 06:13.624
That's right.

06:14.026 --> 06:15.335
Have you ever told a lie ?

06:17.001 --> 06:19.096
- No.
- No ? Not even a little one ?

06:23.247 --> 06:24.555
Okay.

06:25.418 --> 06:28.185
You know, Amy,
sometimes we tell a lie

06:28.739 --> 06:30.574
to protect the people we love,

06:30.638 --> 06:32.272
but it's still a lie, isn't it ?

06:34.495 --> 06:35.778
Yes.

06:42.692 --> 06:45.284
My dad said it was our little secret.

06:47.246 --> 06:48.692
Daddy, what are you doing here ?

06:48.705 --> 06:50.363
Thought I'd surprise you, pumpkin.

06:50.831 --> 06:52.177
Let's go for a ride.

06:57.584 --> 06:58.892
What was your secret ?

07:00.276 --> 07:02.123
I don't want to get him in trouble.

07:04.023 --> 07:05.344
Okay.

07:05.923 --> 07:07.558
Okay. I understand.

07:12.929 --> 07:14.325
Is this our child abuse case ?

07:14.357 --> 07:15.779
Hearing's at 4:00 today.

07:16.030 --> 07:17.727
Horatio asked me to give you a hand.

07:22.194 --> 07:23.829
Would you mind not doing that ?

07:24.125 --> 07:26.075
I'm just, I'm very particular
about my evidence.

07:26.264 --> 07:28.163
It's not a big deal.
I was sorting it by date.

07:28.264 --> 07:29.886
I usually do it by item number.

07:30.238 --> 07:32.125
I'm sorry. I appreciate it. I really do.

07:32.204 --> 07:34.330
It's just that I like to get all my ducks

07:34.331 --> 07:35.878
in a row before I go to court.

07:39.245 --> 07:41.118
Looks like Mom and Dad
have been battling for custody

07:41.119 --> 07:42.993
since the divorce last year.

07:43.308 --> 07:44.729
The court sided with her,

07:44.830 --> 07:46.591
even granted a TRO.

07:47.302 --> 07:48.948
That didn't sit well
with Dad. Two weeks ago,

07:48.949 --> 07:50.332
he grabbed the kid from school.

07:50.333 --> 07:53.086
The police picked them up in
an alley off Northwest 5th Street.

07:53.566 --> 07:55.841
DCS found blood on the girl's underwear.

08:00.359 --> 08:02.419
DNA doesn't match Dad or the girl.

08:03.629 --> 08:05.013
How is that possible ?

08:05.126 --> 08:07.023
It's one of Valera's cases.

08:07.222 --> 08:09.421
She's already been
suspended for one mistake.

08:09.422 --> 08:11.283
I really hope that's not another one.

08:11.436 --> 08:13.410
Right or wrong, the defense is gonna be all over it.

08:13.411 --> 08:15.120
We gotta get the blood retested.

08:16.556 --> 08:17.901
Could you do me a favor ?

08:18.228 --> 08:20.101
Can you handle the DNA retest ?

08:22.291 --> 08:23.624
Yeah, sure.

08:23.700 --> 08:26.101
And just make sure to put
the report in with the file.

09:04.717 --> 09:06.000
You all right ?

09:06.050 --> 09:06.807
Yeah.

09:07.158 --> 09:08.178
I guess.

09:08.202 --> 09:09.500
Why don't you...

09:09.610 --> 09:11.547
step out of the car, please.
I need to see your license.

09:11.633 --> 09:12.527
Hey.

09:12.928 --> 09:14.223
You hit me, right ?

09:14.224 --> 09:17.104
Oh, it doesn't matter. We have to
exchange information. File a police report.

09:17.293 --> 09:18.626
Come on, man.

09:18.941 --> 09:20.902
The cops don't need
to know about this, right ?

09:21.041 --> 09:22.713
Well, the cops already know about it.

09:22.740 --> 09:23.962
MDPD.

09:24.501 --> 09:26.200
So why don't you just step out of the car

09:26.225 --> 09:27.747
and let me see your driver's license ?

09:29.445 --> 09:30.753
Hey.

09:41.615 --> 09:43.892
Dispatch, we got Code 18. Hit-and-run.

09:44.438 --> 09:45.885
Code 18, any victim.

09:46.338 --> 09:47.797
Yeah, there's a victim : me.

09:52.011 --> 09:53.646
It's a long way down, Alexx.

09:54.155 --> 09:55.627
The bigger they are,

09:56.306 --> 09:57.702
the harder they fall.

09:58.809 --> 10:00.531
The question is how did he fall.

10:03.924 --> 10:06.312
I think we can rule out suicide.

10:06.917 --> 10:08.602
Multiple fractures to the ulna

10:08.603 --> 10:10.138
and radius.

10:10.465 --> 10:13.630
- His forearms are broken ?
- Yeah. Means he tensed up,

10:13.680 --> 10:15.088
tried to break his fall.

10:15.340 --> 10:17.101
Not what you'd expect with a jumper.

10:24.934 --> 10:25.792
Hey.

10:28.619 --> 10:29.953
What happened to you ?

10:30.217 --> 10:31.663
Traffic. What do we got ?

10:32.300 --> 10:34.036
We got this guy.
He took the expressway.

10:34.551 --> 10:36.048
16 stories down.

10:36.514 --> 10:37.634
We got a name ?

10:37.658 --> 10:39.394
Manager ID'd him as Bill Keeler.

10:39.570 --> 10:41.331
Said he lived in 1623.

10:45.073 --> 10:46.946
Wonder what made him go over the edge ?

10:47.728 --> 10:49.073
What or who ?

10:54.018 --> 10:55.300
High railing.

10:55.301 --> 10:57.036
No way he tripped and went over this.

10:57.528 --> 10:59.350
I guess that rules out accidental.

11:00.987 --> 11:02.000
Yeah.

11:03.233 --> 11:04.541
So does this.

11:08.610 --> 11:09.512
Check this out.

11:12.468 --> 11:15.183
Well, you know what they say: Good fences make good neighbors.

11:18.672 --> 11:20.937
Unless your neighbor's jacking
your satellite dish.

11:22.177 --> 11:24.999
Mr., uh, Rondinelli,

11:25.034 --> 11:27.018
you live next-door to Bill Keeler ?

11:27.053 --> 11:28.786
Yeah, I do. Did.

11:29.387 --> 11:31.437
It's a hell of a thing, him falling
over the side like that.

11:31.472 --> 11:33.237
Yeah, well, we think
he had a little help.

11:33.272 --> 11:35.548
Did you see or hear anything
unusual this morning ?

11:36.291 --> 11:38.546
I left the apartment at
5:30, went to the gym.

11:39.238 --> 11:40.389
Anyone see you leave ?

11:41.795 --> 11:42.870
What is this ?

11:43.289 --> 11:45.042
You think I had something
to do with it ?

11:45.077 --> 11:46.825
I'm thinking you might
be angry with him.

11:46.860 --> 11:47.834
How do you figure ?

11:48.497 --> 11:50.184
Let's start with your
satellite dish.

11:50.776 --> 11:53.567
You found out the two of you
were sharing more than just a wall.

12:02.288 --> 12:03.955
Guy was skanking my feed.

12:04.419 --> 12:06.381
I started getting billed
for his pay-per-view porno.

12:06.416 --> 12:08.142
So, yeah, I got angry.

12:08.177 --> 12:09.431
Angry enough to kill him ?

12:09.466 --> 12:12.387
Look... I didn't like him,

12:13.814 --> 12:14.924
but I didn't kill him.

12:19.987 --> 12:22.404
Mr. Wolfe, my
child abuse case ?

12:23.085 --> 12:25.247
Tell you one thing, that
hearing's gonna be short and sweet.

12:25.282 --> 12:26.270
Why do you say that ?

12:26.305 --> 12:30.332
DCS requires a DNA sample from
all family members in a custody case.

12:31.148 --> 12:33.514
Mother and daughter
are a familial match.

12:34.172 --> 12:35.706
But Dad's the odd man out.

12:42.638 --> 12:45.488
Brad Manning is not
the biological father.

12:45.523 --> 12:49.518
Looks like he's been spending a lot of time
and money fighting for a kid that's not his.

13:01.418 --> 13:02.284
Hey, Brad,

13:02.582 --> 13:04.715
what about that restraining order ?

13:07.146 --> 13:08.787
I believe the distance...

13:10.090 --> 13:12.049
is about a hundred feet, isn't it ?

13:12.214 --> 13:14.071
I got a measuring
tape in the car.

13:14.106 --> 13:15.217
You're welcome to use it.

13:15.252 --> 13:17.921
Were you looking for trouble or
just another chance to grab her ?

13:17.956 --> 13:18.932
I'm her father.

13:18.967 --> 13:20.034
Really ?

13:20.069 --> 13:23.202
Hey, Brad, news flash:
you're not her father.

13:23.933 --> 13:25.092
What are you talking about ?

13:25.127 --> 13:29.494
I've got a DNA confirmation that says
she's not your biological daughter.

13:39.455 --> 13:41.652
Different state, same BS.

13:43.286 --> 13:45.290
That little girl belongs to me.

13:46.835 --> 13:48.451
We shall see.

14:02.584 --> 14:04.057
I'm a little confused.

14:04.092 --> 14:06.414
The defendant in your abuse
case, Brad Manning,

14:06.449 --> 14:08.012
was charged in Florida, right ?

14:08.047 --> 14:08.831
That's right.

14:09.255 --> 14:11.168
So, why did you want me
to run him out-of-state ?

14:11.203 --> 14:12.600
Something he said to me.

14:14.728 --> 14:16.434
Well, I'm running
him coast to coast.

14:16.469 --> 14:18.258
His name is not
showing up anywhere.

14:18.293 --> 14:20.082
Okay, try the wife, please.

14:20.117 --> 14:21.105
Okay.

14:22.949 --> 14:24.242
So, how'd it go ?

14:24.663 --> 14:25.777
How did what go ?

14:26.396 --> 14:28.221
That business with Ray's file.

14:29.978 --> 14:31.524
There's nothing
more to it, right ?

14:31.559 --> 14:35.243
Yeah, um, the file was fine.

14:36.129 --> 14:36.994
That's good.

14:40.937 --> 14:43.924
Wow. Cheri was no
stranger to the system.

14:44.703 --> 14:47.049
"Wire fraud,
extortion, blackmail."

14:47.771 --> 14:50.235
The Feds were putting a
case together against her.

14:50.702 --> 14:53.560
Victims in New
York, Illinois, Arizona.

14:54.371 --> 14:55.747
Wonder what she was selling.

14:57.525 --> 14:59.534
The question is,
what wasn't she selling ?

14:59.569 --> 15:00.486
Look at that.

15:02.953 --> 15:05.626
She was running personal ads
online, selling her photos.

15:07.710 --> 15:11.207
Complaint says that she was making thousands
of dollars scamming these men.

15:12.505 --> 15:16.371
"I am willing to meet in person
for the right price."

15:17.060 --> 15:18.910
More to her than meets the eye.

15:19.145 --> 15:20.642
You fooled me, Ms. Lyle.

15:20.877 --> 15:21.958
You fooled a lot of people.

15:21.993 --> 15:22.967
What do you mean ?

15:24.359 --> 15:25.542
Do you care to explain ?

15:30.941 --> 15:32.780
I run an online business.

15:32.815 --> 15:35.498
I sell photos and merchandise.

15:35.533 --> 15:36.920
It's perfectly legal.

15:36.955 --> 15:39.655
Apparently, the Attorney
General's office doesn't think so.

15:39.990 --> 15:41.570
You're a scam artist.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.056
Those are business disputes.

15:44.091 --> 15:45.129
Nothing more.

15:45.164 --> 15:47.269
So, you seek out these men
and take their money.

15:47.304 --> 15:48.454
What does that make you ?

15:48.789 --> 15:50.446
A survivor.

15:50.481 --> 15:53.293
Look, I've been on my
own since I was 15.

15:53.328 --> 15:56.164
I've done a lot of things
that I'm not proud of.

15:56.888 --> 15:58.920
I don't want Amy to
ever go through that.

15:59.255 --> 16:01.207
That's no excuse for
committing fraud.

16:02.055 --> 16:03.326
That's unproven.

16:03.561 --> 16:04.785
For now.

16:04.820 --> 16:08.420
Well, until it is, I'll do what
I have to to protect my daughter.

16:08.455 --> 16:09.620
So will we.

16:11.218 --> 16:12.545
Just about to call you.

16:13.572 --> 16:15.701
Finished up the
post on our falling guy.

16:16.238 --> 16:17.247
What'd you get ?

16:17.282 --> 16:19.758
Small puncture wounds
on his hands.

16:20.479 --> 16:22.123
Now, they could have been
from the struggle.

16:22.620 --> 16:23.790
But look at this.

16:23.825 --> 16:25.354
On his neck.

16:26.297 --> 16:28.242
The skin is discolored.

16:28.277 --> 16:30.481
I sent the swab to Trace.

16:31.642 --> 16:33.289
And there's one other thing.

16:33.324 --> 16:34.104
What ?

16:34.139 --> 16:35.959
I found split ends.

16:35.994 --> 16:37.747
So, the guy doesn't
use conditioner.

16:37.782 --> 16:39.914
Found them further south.

16:40.637 --> 16:41.823
This ought to be good.

16:41.858 --> 16:42.957
It's anecdotal,

16:42.992 --> 16:47.621
but I have seen a correlation between
damaged pubic hair and sexual deviance.

16:47.656 --> 16:51.108
Okay, so, what turned him on ?

16:51.143 --> 16:53.170
That's up to you to find out.

16:56.058 --> 16:57.309
Lieutenant ? Lieutenant Caine ?

16:57.344 --> 16:58.323
Yeah ?

16:58.358 --> 17:00.095
Nicole Talcott
from night shift.

17:00.130 --> 17:01.600
I'm covering DNA for Valera.

17:01.635 --> 17:03.694
Anyway, you're not going
to believe this.

17:03.729 --> 17:05.290
Bill Keeler, your falling guy

17:05.325 --> 17:07.434
it turns out he's a
registered sex offender.

17:09.701 --> 17:11.117
But that's not the best part.

17:11.152 --> 17:12.550
What is the best part ?

17:12.585 --> 17:14.351
Got a second case: child abuse.

17:14.386 --> 17:16.662
Matched Keeler to blood
found on the victim's underwear.

17:18.448 --> 17:20.705
Underwear. Amy Manning.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.484
Yeah. How'd you know ?

17:26.522 --> 17:28.053
These cases are related.

17:28.734 --> 17:30.499
Of course I
knew him, Lieutenant.

17:31.107 --> 17:32.332
Bill and I were dating.

17:33.077 --> 17:34.572
Who would want to kill him ?

17:35.376 --> 17:36.337
I don't know.

17:36.372 --> 17:38.162
Everyone loved Bill.

17:39.530 --> 17:41.288
Amy's going to be heartbroken.

17:41.323 --> 17:42.884
Did you know

17:42.919 --> 17:45.044
that Bill was molesting Amy ?

17:48.583 --> 17:49.878
That's not possible.

17:49.913 --> 17:51.799
So, you're
saying you didn't know ?

17:51.834 --> 17:52.964
Well, of course not.

17:52.999 --> 17:55.554
I would never put my
daughter in that kind of jeopardy.

17:57.864 --> 18:00.074
I'm not a monster,
Lieutenant Caine.

18:01.717 --> 18:05.219
Delko found these pictures
on Bill Keeler's hard drive.

18:06.114 --> 18:07.258
More personal ads.

18:09.729 --> 18:11.464
"More personal ads" ?

18:24.278 --> 18:25.471
"Instant family.

18:25.506 --> 18:26.758
"Package deal.

18:28.346 --> 18:31.261
"Two... for the price of one."

18:31.662 --> 18:33.285
That is not what you think.

18:33.820 --> 18:35.237
What do I think ?

18:36.078 --> 18:37.081
You're twisting it,

18:37.316 --> 18:38.701
making it dirty.

18:39.367 --> 18:40.865
I'm just being honest.

18:41.100 --> 18:42.994
You haven't been
honest with us yet.

18:43.722 --> 18:46.296
Most women lie about the
fact that they have a kid.

18:46.531 --> 18:48.549
Try not to scare the guys off.

18:49.337 --> 18:50.770
I put it right out front.

18:51.194 --> 18:52.834
What you see is what you get.

18:54.074 --> 18:59.817
What I see is a woman who's
selling her own child.

19:00.669 --> 19:02.638
I don't care
what you people think.

19:02.873 --> 19:04.546
I love my daughter.

19:07.697 --> 19:08.666
Calleigh,

19:08.901 --> 19:11.262
we got a court order from
Brad Manning's defense attorney.

19:11.497 --> 19:13.730
Okay, Dad, I'll be
there as soon as I can.

19:13.765 --> 19:14.782
Will you just sit tight ?

19:14.817 --> 19:16.074
Great.

19:16.858 --> 19:19.871
They want his original vial of
blood sent to a private lab.

19:19.906 --> 19:21.546
Questioning our
chain of custody.

19:22.336 --> 19:23.856
Can you take care of it, Ryan ?

19:23.891 --> 19:25.944
Uh, yeah, sure. What's up ?

19:25.979 --> 19:27.653
Nothing. I just have
to take care of something.

19:28.951 --> 19:30.126
Okay.

19:30.161 --> 19:31.531
All right, thank you very much.

19:31.566 --> 19:32.733
I will see you at court at 4:00.

19:32.768 --> 19:33.752
4 a clock.

19:40.431 --> 19:41.881
Horatio

19:41.916 --> 19:42.869
Yes, Alexx ?

19:42.904 --> 19:44.988
I've got the findings
on our falling guy.

19:45.023 --> 19:46.243
Thought you'd like to see them.

19:49.450 --> 19:51.706
Streaks on the neck
are hair dye, Alexx ?

19:51.741 --> 19:53.513
Yeah. Hair dye gel.

19:53.548 --> 19:57.228
Acetic acid, methylparaben,
yellow dye #3

19:57.263 --> 19:58.897
stains skin brown.

19:58.932 --> 20:01.018
Probably
transferred from the killer.

20:04.659 --> 20:06.380
Seen that look before.

20:06.615 --> 20:07.732
Got a suspect ?

20:07.767 --> 20:09.958
Yes. I spoke to
him this morning.

20:10.678 --> 20:11.935
You Horatio Caine ?

20:12.506 --> 20:13.738
Speaking. And you are... ?

20:13.773 --> 20:17.242
Brad Manning. I got a case coming
up in court today at 4:00.

20:18.178 --> 20:20.552
Alexx, I'm beginning to get
the picture of his day.

20:21.900 --> 20:23.085
After he left me,

20:23.120 --> 20:26.293
he went to see a man who he believed
was molesting his child.

20:33.564 --> 20:36.732
So, Brad was actually
trying to protect her.

20:37.320 --> 20:39.039
And I don't think
he's done yet, Alexx.

20:39.074 --> 20:40.740
You think he's after
the ex-wife ?

20:40.775 --> 20:41.914
He knows where she is,

20:41.949 --> 20:43.559
and when she'll be there.

21:01.867 --> 21:03.548
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:03.997 --> 21:05.798
I've got that sample for
the custody hearing.

21:05.833 --> 21:06.842
How do you want to handle it ?

21:07.435 --> 21:08.443
What sample ?

21:08.768 --> 21:10.298
The blood sample; I
got it right here.

21:12.581 --> 21:14.111
You took a biological out of the lab ?

21:14.146 --> 21:15.507
It's not even in a Kapak.

21:15.942 --> 21:16.842
What ?

21:18.563 --> 21:19.971
I just can't believe
that you've done that.

21:20.706 --> 21:22.485
I got a court order,
and I followed it.

21:22.520 --> 21:23.372
What's the problem ?

21:23.947 --> 21:25.524
You never bring
blood to court.

21:25.559 --> 21:26.924
You violated protocol.

21:27.319 --> 21:29.439
When I was in patrol,
we did what we were told.

21:29.474 --> 21:30.873
You are not in patrol anymore.

21:30.908 --> 21:31.997
What you should have done

21:32.032 --> 21:35.470
is call the State Attorney and
have him appeal the court order.

21:35.505 --> 21:36.876
Well you know, I
could've used that advice,

21:36.911 --> 21:38.661
but you were off
bailing out your dad again.

21:53.901 --> 21:56.534
Amy, why don't you go get
yourself something to drink ?

21:56.569 --> 21:58.013
I'll meet you inside, okay ?

22:23.134 --> 22:23.950
Hey.

22:26.242 --> 22:28.290
Hey, come here a minute. Hey.

22:31.312 --> 22:33.159
All units, I've got
a 315 in progress.

22:33.188 --> 22:36.734
Officer needs assistance. I'm at the
Biscayne Courthouse on Flagler.

22:37.712 --> 22:39.011
You remember me ?

22:39.059 --> 22:39.675
No.

22:41.006 --> 22:41.995
Sorry.

22:42.023 --> 22:43.255
I got to go.

22:43.312 --> 22:44.759
No, come here a minute.

23:05.952 --> 23:06.990
Brad !

23:08.075 --> 23:09.383
Don't do it.

23:30.167 --> 23:31.347
Calleigh !

23:31.754 --> 23:33.023
Calleigh...?

23:34.530 --> 23:35.823
Oh, my God.

23:37.149 --> 23:38.362
It's okay.

23:39.527 --> 23:40.835
I'm not hit.

23:48.627 --> 23:50.909
All right, twice in
one day. What's going on ?

23:50.941 --> 23:51.834
Nothing.

23:51.882 --> 23:54.388
Okay, Mary Poppins, what's
the deal with the umbrella ?

23:54.419 --> 23:56.175
Not a cloud in the sky.

23:58.857 --> 24:01.426
Oh, you're blocking the
security camera, are you ?

24:01.682 --> 24:02.894
All right.

24:03.280 --> 24:04.908
Let's take a little ride.

24:25.333 --> 24:27.647
Don't let her
take my little girl.

24:30.678 --> 24:31.923
I won't.

24:40.028 --> 24:41.005
I won't.

25:01.814 --> 25:03.904
God ! It hurts.

25:04.016 --> 25:07.542
Get used to it. I'm going to have
to extract that bullet for evidence.

25:07.623 --> 25:10.001
Thank you for saving my life.

25:10.224 --> 25:13.830
My only concern is your
daughter right now. Officer...

25:14.567 --> 25:16.641
Can you bring her to
the hospital, please ?

25:16.673 --> 25:17.918
Yes, ma'am.

25:19.497 --> 25:22.194
The little girl stays with
us, you understand ?

25:28.550 --> 25:31.630
You want me to place
this child in protective care

25:32.236 --> 25:34.454
against the wishes
of the parent ?

25:34.687 --> 25:37.495
We believe that protection
is warranted in this case.

25:37.529 --> 25:39.125
- Anything you'd like to share ?
- The mother

25:39.141 --> 25:42.061
is involved in pandering and
using her child as bait.

25:42.141 --> 25:43.704
You think, or you know ?

25:43.784 --> 25:45.843
I need more time.

25:51.295 --> 25:53.912
This child has nowhere
else to go.

25:55.351 --> 25:58.255
I can hold her as long as
her mother's in the hospital.

25:58.383 --> 25:59.564
After that,

25:59.604 --> 26:00.992
Mom has a right to custody.

26:01.008 --> 26:03.122
Understood. And appreciated.

26:04.877 --> 26:06.361
Low five. Ready ?

26:06.388 --> 26:07.729
Here it comes.

26:10.856 --> 26:13.537
Ran into you this
morning, literally.

26:13.842 --> 26:16.188
Then you show up at
our little shoot-out

26:16.890 --> 26:18.182
with this.

26:19.701 --> 26:22.222
I have a skin condition.

26:22.302 --> 26:23.499
Sun's harmful.

26:23.531 --> 26:26.189
So is video surveillance when
you're trying to kill someone.

26:26.212 --> 26:27.089
Hey,

26:27.753 --> 26:30.577
I was just standing there.

26:30.625 --> 26:31.630
Yeah.

26:31.808 --> 26:35.621
Eyewitness accounts aren't as reliable
as a security camera. Now you were there.

26:35.653 --> 26:37.855
Your job was to obstruct
the view.

26:38.209 --> 26:40.395
- Hey, come here a minute.
- Sorry.

26:40.443 --> 26:41.847
I got to go.

26:41.943 --> 26:42.545
No.

26:45.982 --> 26:48.216
And, Don, that sounds
like conspiracy to me.

26:48.264 --> 26:50.498
Now I can make this
day very long day for you.

26:55.115 --> 26:56.089
Okay.

26:58.084 --> 27:00.381
I picked up this
guy at the airport.

27:00.461 --> 27:02.201
Said he didn't drive.

27:02.735 --> 27:05.416
Wanted me to take
him around all day.

27:05.527 --> 27:06.979
Paid cash.

27:07.043 --> 27:08.767
Told me where to go,

27:09.191 --> 27:10.611
what to do.

27:14.643 --> 27:15.984
Is that him ?

27:18.250 --> 27:18.899
No.

27:19.430 --> 27:20.851
That's not him.

27:21.514 --> 27:22.871
Sit tight, Don.

27:26.741 --> 27:27.374
Hi.

27:28.856 --> 27:31.282
Dade Memorial pulled
a round out of Mom.

27:31.314 --> 27:32.670
Patrol ran it over here.

27:32.686 --> 27:34.011
It's a.45.

27:34.706 --> 27:37.355
That's weird. Brad fired a.38.

27:38.298 --> 27:40.628
Horatio carries a nine-mil,
department-issue.

27:40.708 --> 27:42.766
Yeah, but he only fired once.

27:42.791 --> 27:45.329
Alexx pulled his
round out of Brad's chest.

27:45.561 --> 27:46.950
What about the umbrella man ?

27:46.973 --> 27:48.473
Tripp had him the whole time.

27:48.521 --> 27:50.851
So if Brad didn't shoot
Cheri, who did ?

27:55.137 --> 27:55.983
Hey.

27:56.736 --> 27:59.847
If you're here about the courthouse
security camera, there's nothing.

27:59.879 --> 28:01.571
What about the news cameras ?

28:01.651 --> 28:03.262
WFOR was out there.

28:03.318 --> 28:04.818
Their raw footage
just came in.

28:04.850 --> 28:06.110
Let's take a look.

28:07.629 --> 28:10.055
... an accusation the defense
vehemently denies.

28:10.231 --> 28:13.231
Closing arguments are scheduled
for 8:00 a.m. Monday morning.

28:14.316 --> 28:15.608
Good. I think was good.

28:15.633 --> 28:17.054
Do you think we should...

28:21.431 --> 28:23.474
They didn't get it on video.

28:23.738 --> 28:26.020
It doesn't matter. We just
need the sound anyway.

28:26.068 --> 28:28.398
Will you back it up and
play it again slower.

28:37.945 --> 28:39.828
There it is, three shots.

28:39.874 --> 28:41.621
Can we do it again ? And will
you give me an audiogram of it.

28:41.622 --> 28:43.368
Yeah.

28:49.512 --> 28:51.985
See, there's a small spike
after the second shot.

28:52.049 --> 28:53.565
Bullet hitting something ?

28:53.613 --> 28:55.576
Or the sound
hitting something.

28:55.799 --> 28:57.060
An echo maybe ?

28:57.104 --> 28:59.578
I don't know. Shots one
and three didn't have it.

28:59.945 --> 29:02.067
Tyler, will you download
this onto my laptop ?

29:02.068 --> 29:04.189
I'm going to take
this show on the road.

29:19.582 --> 29:21.792
Are you sure this is a
WFOR microphone ?

29:21.793 --> 29:24.002
I want to make sure it has
the same sensitivity.

29:24.034 --> 29:26.603
Well, they let me pull it
right out of their van.

29:26.825 --> 29:30.384
According to the video, you're
standing where the news lady was.

29:30.521 --> 29:33.146
Horatio was standing
approximately here,

29:33.147 --> 29:35.771
facing northwest when
he discharged his weapon.

29:36.954 --> 29:39.539
Brad fired his.38 from
where you're standing.

29:40.146 --> 29:41.422
Let's light'em up.

29:43.552 --> 29:45.387
Fire in the hole !

30:00.646 --> 30:04.332
Shots from Horatio and Brad's
position didn't leave an echo stamp.

30:04.757 --> 30:07.198
So the mystery
shooter provided the echo.

30:08.109 --> 30:10.694
Find the echo, find the
shooter's position.

30:50.457 --> 30:51.402
We got it.

30:53.482 --> 30:57.878
It's might explain why Cheri survived.
It's a tough shot from this distance.

30:59.883 --> 31:01.383
I've got something.

31:04.328 --> 31:05.860
It's newspaper.

31:06.020 --> 31:07.711
Looks like it's charred.

31:14.376 --> 31:15.924
Explains why nobody saw him.

31:15.940 --> 31:19.211
Unfortunately, anyone with spare
change can buy a newspaper.

31:19.243 --> 31:20.903
It's a little bit of a reach.

31:20.953 --> 31:22.038
Maybe.

31:23.060 --> 31:24.272
Maybe not.

32:04.795 --> 32:07.667
Mass spec found carbon
black, microcrystalline.

32:08.497 --> 32:11.242
I'm not surprised.
It's newspaper ink.

32:12.344 --> 32:14.354
Hey, wait a minute.
What is this, soy ink ?

32:14.378 --> 32:16.588
Commercial printers in the Northeast
are just starting to use it.

32:16.620 --> 32:18.561
It's, uh, cheaper. It's better
for the environment.

32:18.608 --> 32:22.304
Okay, so our newspaper was bought
by someone in the Northeast.

32:22.325 --> 32:24.497
Unfortunately, that doesn't
narrow it down that much.

32:24.506 --> 32:28.192
Tripp said umbrella man's passenger didn't
drive. It sounds like a New Yorker to me.

32:28.216 --> 32:29.700
A New Yorker with motive.

32:30.141 --> 32:31.714
Vincent Lesca.
He's from Brooklyn.

32:31.730 --> 32:34.730
He was one of the victims in
Cheri Lyle's federal fraud case.

32:34.746 --> 32:36.565
How much did
she take him for ?

32:36.598 --> 32:39.534
$50,000. I think it's certainly enough
to make him want to kill her.

32:39.598 --> 32:43.572
What are the odds that two men would
attempt to kill the same woman

32:43.667 --> 32:45.263
on the same day ?

32:45.072 --> 32:46.669
Gosh, I would say,
judging from her Web site,

32:46.670 --> 32:48.266
it could be as
many as a hundred men.

32:48.289 --> 32:50.348
Okay, so where...

32:51.146 --> 32:52.725
is Vincent ?

32:54.523 --> 32:57.539
Picked up Vincent here at the
Shore Club. Says he's on vacation.

32:57.571 --> 32:59.343
Was nowhere
near the courthouse.

32:59.510 --> 33:01.521
It's not exactly
in the tourist books.

33:01.850 --> 33:04.452
No, it's not, but
Cheri Lyle was there today.

33:04.739 --> 33:06.510
You remember Cheri,
don't you, Vincent ?

33:06.606 --> 33:08.457
Took you for 50
grand back in Brooklyn.

33:08.492 --> 33:09.844
Small world.

33:10.212 --> 33:12.603
Yours is about to get smaller.

33:12.811 --> 33:14.594
Someone took a shot at her.

33:14.968 --> 33:16.869
I don't know
anything about that.

33:16.985 --> 33:18.769
Yeah, well, your
driver says different.

33:18.923 --> 33:20.523
He ID'd you on the way in.

33:21.949 --> 33:23.471
I got nothing to say.

33:24.206 --> 33:25.002
That's all right.

33:25.644 --> 33:27.035
We'll do the talking for you.

33:27.079 --> 33:29.037
I'm going to get
this swab to DNA.

33:33.864 --> 33:34.970
Hey, come here.

33:36.597 --> 33:38.446
Hey, have you seen Calleigh ?

33:39.515 --> 33:40.387
No. What's up ?

33:40.491 --> 33:42.942
Well, just found something
interesting.

33:43.117 --> 33:44.261
Take a look.

33:47.222 --> 33:48.613
What do you see ?

33:48.805 --> 33:50.546
Horatio fired first.

33:50.632 --> 33:53.853
Echo recognition tells us
the second shot was Vincent.

33:53.860 --> 33:54.918
Brad was third.

33:54.922 --> 33:56.820
He squeezed off a
round as he went down.

33:56.960 --> 33:59.266
But what do you hear ?

34:02.024 --> 34:03.174
Same three shots.

34:03.210 --> 34:05.331
Yeah, but listen to the first two.

34:06.036 --> 34:08.273
Almost on top of each other.

34:10.311 --> 34:11.837
What are you getting at, Tyler ?

34:11.908 --> 34:15.639
Second shot came only .15
seconds after the first.

34:16.884 --> 34:20.164
World-class sprinters don't
get off the blocks that fast.

34:20.668 --> 34:23.341
There wasn't enough time for
Vincent to react to Horatio's shot.

34:23.369 --> 34:24.763
Which means he
couldn't have known

34:24.764 --> 34:26.934
that Brad was going to get
hit first and go down.

34:26.969 --> 34:28.960
Vincent Lesca wasn't
trying to shoot Cheri.

34:28.960 --> 34:30.484
He was trying to hit Brad.

34:45.429 --> 34:47.188
Question is, why ?

34:48.399 --> 34:50.301
Maybe somebody put
him up to it.

34:50.926 --> 34:54.085
Look, I'm the one that got shot.
I gave my statement.

34:54.129 --> 34:55.603
What more do you need from me ?

34:55.681 --> 34:59.211
The bullet in your shoulder came
from a third shooter, Ms. Lyle.

34:59.597 --> 35:01.142
And we have him in custody.

35:01.320 --> 35:03.652
Oh. But I thought
it was my ex-husband...

35:03.890 --> 35:06.401
He came right at
me. He had a gun.

35:11.958 --> 35:12.944
Hey.

35:13.641 --> 35:14.946
Uh...

35:15.329 --> 35:17.702
I was just getting some clarification
from Ms. Lyle about the...

35:17.737 --> 35:19.444
Tyler already
got me up to speed.

35:19.567 --> 35:21.638
I think I can
handle it from here, Ryan.

35:22.882 --> 35:24.917
Do you recognize this man, Ms. Lyle ?

35:27.169 --> 35:28.345
Brooklyn Vinnie.

35:28.905 --> 35:30.749
I always wondered if
he'd show up again.

35:31.263 --> 35:32.584
You must be good.

35:33.248 --> 35:36.225
He came all the way down from
New York to help you murder your ex.

35:37.929 --> 35:38.880
What ?

35:39.693 --> 35:41.368
Vincent's bullet was
meant for Brad,

35:41.369 --> 35:44.438
and I think you arranged it to
guarantee custody of your daughter.

35:44.503 --> 35:45.853
I'm not a murderer.

35:46.157 --> 35:47.422
And you have no proof.

35:48.112 --> 35:49.241
I'm a mother.

35:49.479 --> 35:51.640
Actually, we have no
proof of that either.

35:53.704 --> 35:57.106
Unless you have something
to back up these accusations,

35:57.537 --> 35:59.186
I'm going to walk out of here.

36:19.405 --> 36:21.762
That woman is bad news,
and she's gonna get custody

36:21.763 --> 36:22.599
of that little girl.

36:22.604 --> 36:24.220
Not if we can help it.

36:24.222 --> 36:25.805
How do you want to do it ?

36:25.840 --> 36:27.388
You need to call in a favor.

36:41.012 --> 36:41.972
Uh, hey.

36:42.870 --> 36:44.763
Hey, Ryan. You
remember my dad.

36:44.764 --> 36:45.807
I sure do.

36:45.968 --> 36:47.337
It's good to see
you, Mr. Duquesne.

36:47.518 --> 36:49.084
Ah, same, Ryan.

36:54.107 --> 36:56.010
How are things these days ?

36:57.798 --> 36:58.355
Well...

36:58.358 --> 37:00.433
if you're referring to my DUI,

37:00.765 --> 37:02.833
I don't know what I would
do without Calleigh.

37:05.604 --> 37:07.847
Uh, you know, I have
something you should look at.

37:08.144 --> 37:09.407
Okay, in a minute.

37:10.283 --> 37:11.041
Are you set ?

37:11.148 --> 37:12.467
Can you put the wheels in motion ?

37:12.597 --> 37:14.482
Yep, yep. We'll talk soon.

37:14.516 --> 37:15.396
- Okay.
- Bye.

37:20.624 --> 37:21.645
Thanks, Dad.

37:21.738 --> 37:22.592
Bye.

37:25.351 --> 37:27.564
About the interview,
I left you a message.

37:27.743 --> 37:29.941
I didn't get it, and
you should've waited.

37:30.451 --> 37:32.707
- Okay, what I wanted...
- I know what you wanted.

38:13.087 --> 38:14.526
What is this ?

38:14.688 --> 38:16.202
What am I looking at here ?

38:16.313 --> 38:18.347
You're looking at your
daughter's DNA.

38:18.843 --> 38:21.466
You're Amy
Manning's biological father.

38:27.803 --> 38:29.822
When I saw that Web site,

38:30.621 --> 38:33.748
it was like looking in a mirror.
There was no doubt at all.

38:33.822 --> 38:35.074
She was mine.

38:35.986 --> 38:37.032
Legally,

38:37.829 --> 38:39.502
she was Brad Manning's
daughter.

38:39.598 --> 38:42.009
He's connected by a piece
of paper. I'm her blood.

38:42.074 --> 38:43.370
So, what, you thought by

38:43.775 --> 38:46.148
getting him out of the way,
you'd step in and be Daddy ?

38:46.173 --> 38:47.988
I always wanted a family.

38:48.506 --> 38:50.006
And there it was.

38:50.753 --> 38:51.957
And I could've made it work.

38:51.992 --> 38:53.147
Well, you could
have made it work

38:53.148 --> 38:54.806
if you had done
it the right way.

38:54.825 --> 38:55.402
You mean, uh,

38:55.403 --> 38:57.295
let the legal system run its course ?

38:57.981 --> 39:01.107
Come on, that's a battle
I'd lose, and you know it.

39:01.198 --> 39:02.275
I know this.

39:03.261 --> 39:06.494
With an attempted murder charge,
It's all gone, Vinnie.

39:07.813 --> 39:08.942
It's all gone.

39:13.794 --> 39:14.326
Horatio.

39:14.341 --> 39:14.881
Uh-huh ?

39:15.186 --> 39:15.984
Amy's missing.

39:15.992 --> 39:16.494
What ?

39:22.487 --> 39:25.351
Her mom showed up at DCS. The
little girl ran out the back.

39:25.386 --> 39:26.796
Counselor
found an open window.

39:26.803 --> 39:28.560
She's running from
her mother, Frank.

39:28.563 --> 39:29.846
Let's put out a BOLO.

39:29.881 --> 39:31.558
I'm on it. We got
cars at the school.

39:31.559 --> 39:32.836
We're canvassing
all the bus stations

39:32.871 --> 39:34.224
between here and Broward.

39:34.344 --> 39:36.313
If she found transportation,
she could be anywhere.

39:36.314 --> 39:37.505
Not necessarily.

39:40.027 --> 39:41.327
That looks like a good book.

39:41.661 --> 39:44.892
It's about a talking
cat. Have you read it ?

39:46.872 --> 39:49.984
Frank, she'll go
where she feels safe.

40:17.270 --> 40:19.050
You already know how it ends.

40:19.546 --> 40:20.425
Yeah,

40:20.898 --> 40:22.498
but it's still good.

40:28.220 --> 40:31.285
Amy, your mom came
looking for you,

40:31.323 --> 40:32.866
but nobody could find you.

40:33.491 --> 40:35.395
I didn't want to go with her.

40:37.696 --> 40:40.709
I can't be nice to
her boyfriends anymore.

40:43.107 --> 40:45.176
I understand.

40:45.773 --> 40:47.779
Is that why your dad

40:48.094 --> 40:50.709
took you from school ?
Was that the secret ?

40:53.454 --> 40:55.595
He was going to take me away.

40:56.024 --> 40:58.300
Somewhere they
couldn't hurt me.

40:59.670 --> 41:01.484
Well, he got his wishes...

41:02.400 --> 41:05.194
because no one will
ever hurt you again.

41:05.748 --> 41:06.505
Okay ?

41:09.949 --> 41:10.922
Okay.

41:12.856 --> 41:14.721
Thank you for finding Amy.

41:14.850 --> 41:16.098
I can't believe DCS.

41:16.133 --> 41:19.199
They just let her walk
right out from under their noses.

41:21.815 --> 41:22.396
So where is she ?

41:22.403 --> 41:25.702
I can assure you she's in
excellent hands, Ms. Lyle.

41:25.794 --> 41:26.962
I want to see her.

41:27.212 --> 41:29.154
Ms. Lyle, I'm afraid
you're gonna have to direct

41:29.172 --> 41:32.091
all your questions
to Amy's attorney.

41:33.107 --> 41:34.407
What are you talking about ?

41:34.423 --> 41:35.361
Ms. Lyle,

41:35.544 --> 41:37.021
Kenwall Duquesne.

41:37.176 --> 41:42.206
Mr. Duquesne will represent Amy in
all matters pertaining to child custody.

41:42.241 --> 41:44.344
A lawyer ? She's
eight years old.

41:44.413 --> 41:47.411
The Department of Child
Services has been provided sufficient

41:47.446 --> 41:50.410
evidence by Lieutenant Caine
to file a dependency action.

41:50.414 --> 41:51.898
No, she is my daughter.

41:51.958 --> 41:54.792
The DCS feels that she should
become a ward of the state.

41:55.049 --> 41:56.347
You can't do this.

41:56.840 --> 41:58.209
I'm afraid we can.

41:58.328 --> 42:00.338
Judge signed off
on the petition.

42:02.217 --> 42:03.751
Oh, this is not over.

42:03.769 --> 42:07.103
It is over, Ms. Lyle. You're
under arrest for trafficking

42:07.241 --> 42:09.033
and child endangerment.

42:09.216 --> 42:10.313
Right, counselor ?

42:11.104 --> 42:12.435
That's right, sir.

42:13.780 --> 42:14.592
Take care.

42:38.173 --> 42:40.921
I didn't know
about your, your dad

42:40.956 --> 42:43.670
and, uh, what you
were trying to do.

42:47.723 --> 42:49.839
You know, I've
learned in this business,

42:49.874 --> 42:51.879
just because you know
one thing about a person

42:51.914 --> 42:53.885
doesn't mean you know
everything about him.

43:18.901 --> 43:20.558
You lost your place.

43:21.579 --> 43:23.130
I can find it.

43:40.383 --> 43:41.945
Yeah, you can.
