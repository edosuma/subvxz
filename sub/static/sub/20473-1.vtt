01:04.908 --> 01:06.439
Good morning, Herr Minister.

01:06.440 --> 01:08.904
Good morning, Eric. To
the Reichstag, please.

01:44.371 --> 01:46.612
What are they doing?

01:49.704 --> 01:51.874
Eric!

01:51.875 --> 01:53.598
Walther Rathenau,

01:53.599 --> 01:54.972
Minister of

01:54.973 --> 01:57.046
- Foreign Affairs for the Weimar Republic?
- Eric,

01:57.047 --> 01:59.063
- drive!
- Death to the Elders of Zion.

02:08.638 --> 02:10.935
And this is for ruining Germany,

02:10.936 --> 02:13.431
Jew pig.

02:14.672 --> 02:16.107
All right.

02:20.994 --> 02:23.872
Go, go, go, go!

02:36.127 --> 02:37.563
I have a proposition to make.

02:37.564 --> 02:39.288
Not now, Albert.

02:39.289 --> 02:40.884
It is an unorthodox idea, but...

02:40.885 --> 02:42.193
Please be quiet.

02:46.282 --> 02:48.388
But crazier thoughts of mine have worked

02:48.389 --> 02:49.696
- in the past.
- Pick me up!

02:51.773 --> 02:53.208
Oh, God.

02:53.209 --> 02:55.283
- Oh, God! Oh, God!
- God would

02:55.284 --> 02:58.573
most likely disapprove of this
idea, but I would convince him.

02:59.914 --> 03:01.445
Move in with me, Betty.

03:27.500 --> 03:29.000
You haven't given me

03:29.001 --> 03:31.330
an answer.

03:31.331 --> 03:33.597
You're late for your lecture.

03:33.598 --> 03:34.875
My lecture can wait.

03:34.876 --> 03:36.566
Fine.

03:36.567 --> 03:39.185
Since you have so much time,
shall we address your schedule?

03:39.186 --> 03:42.060
The Telegraph, Life Magazine

03:42.061 --> 03:45.411
and the Los Angeles Times have
all requested interviews, and

03:45.412 --> 03:47.199
please don't forget you
invited Minister Rathenau

03:47.200 --> 03:48.572
to dinner on Sunday.

03:48.573 --> 03:49.977
Betty,

03:49.978 --> 03:51.414
move in with me.

03:51.415 --> 03:53.967
You have a wife.

03:53.968 --> 03:55.276
Whom I adore.

03:55.277 --> 03:56.364
You're insane.

03:56.365 --> 03:58.343
No.

03:58.344 --> 04:00.864
I'm quite rational, actually.

04:00.865 --> 04:03.610
Monogamy is not natural.

04:03.611 --> 04:06.835
It is a construct of
religious authority.

04:06.836 --> 04:09.709
And a foolish faith in
authority, my dear Betty,

04:09.710 --> 04:11.593
is the worst enemy of truth.

04:11.594 --> 04:14.146
Truth being that rules
don't apply to you?

04:14.147 --> 04:17.019
I love Mozart and Bach.

04:17.021 --> 04:20.628
I love the Swiss Alps
and the Baltic Sea.

04:20.629 --> 04:23.694
Why can't I love you and Elsa?

04:23.695 --> 04:26.759
For a man who is an
expert on the universe,

04:26.760 --> 04:29.729
you don't know the first
thing about people, do you?

04:29.730 --> 04:31.069
No, no, no.

04:31.070 --> 04:33.438
Forgive me, Betty.

04:35.220 --> 04:37.423
Perhaps...

04:37.424 --> 04:41.547
triangular geometry is not as
simple as I'd like it to be.

04:47.768 --> 04:50.897
Professor Einstein's office.

04:50.898 --> 04:52.237
Yeah, one moment, please.

04:52.238 --> 04:53.999
It's Mileva Maric.

04:54.793 --> 04:58.081
I can't.

04:58.082 --> 05:00.443
Not now.

05:00.444 --> 05:02.518
I apologize. The professor is busy.

05:02.519 --> 05:04.467
May I take a message?

05:04.468 --> 05:06.351
Yes, Frau.

05:06.352 --> 05:07.978
She says it's urgent.

05:07.979 --> 05:10.603
As you said, I'm late for my lecture.

05:11.971 --> 05:13.661
What is...

05:13.662 --> 05:15.163
time?

05:15.164 --> 05:17.652
A deceptively simple question,

05:17.653 --> 05:21.005
yet it is the key to
understanding relativity.

05:21.006 --> 05:22.953
It is also the reason
my hair is going gray.

05:24.263 --> 05:26.433
When we describe motion,

05:26.434 --> 05:28.860
we do so as a function of time:

05:28.861 --> 05:32.244
ten meters per second,
100 miles per hour.

05:32.245 --> 05:35.533
But a mathematical
description of velocity is moot

05:35.534 --> 05:40.129
unless we can define "time."

05:40.130 --> 05:41.919
Is time universal?

05:41.920 --> 05:44.631
In other words, is there
an audible tick-tock

05:44.632 --> 05:46.261
throughout the galaxy?

05:46.262 --> 05:48.143
A master clock, so to speak,

05:48.144 --> 05:51.561
forging ahead like Mozart's metronome?

05:51.562 --> 05:53.636
The answer, my friends,

05:53.637 --> 05:55.168
is no.

05:55.169 --> 05:57.722
Time is not absolute.

05:57.723 --> 06:00.755
In fact, for us believing
physicists, the distinction

06:00.756 --> 06:03.182
between the past, present

06:03.183 --> 06:08.068
and future is but a stubborn illusion.

06:17.264 --> 06:19.664
A lot to consider, I know.

06:20.744 --> 06:23.712
I know.

06:26.012 --> 06:28.533
But understanding time is essential

06:28.534 --> 06:30.513
to understanding relativity.

06:30.514 --> 06:32.844
Now,

06:32.845 --> 06:34.951
I want you all to close your eyes.

06:34.952 --> 06:36.963
Not to worry. I don't bite.

06:36.964 --> 06:39.197
But I am on the lookout for a new pen.

06:40.475 --> 06:42.550
Go on.

06:42.551 --> 06:44.721
Close your eyes.

06:44.722 --> 06:48.202
To truly grasp the idea of time,

06:48.203 --> 06:51.337
we must take a step back
and ask: what is light?

06:52.449 --> 06:56.310
So, journey with me to the Sun.

07:06.179 --> 07:09.944
Light travels from the Sun to
the Earth through space, yes?

07:09.945 --> 07:12.658
When I was your age,
I wanted to know how

07:12.659 --> 07:15.053
can something... light...
travel through nothing...

07:15.054 --> 07:18.565
space? Let us isolate a light beam

07:18.566 --> 07:22.653
and travel alongside
it, but let us go faster.

07:22.654 --> 07:24.989
Are you there with me?

07:25.973 --> 07:29.197
Faster. Faster!

07:31.146 --> 07:34.089
What is time?

07:35.010 --> 07:37.052
Herr Einstein, wake up!

07:37.053 --> 07:38.807
I wasn't sleeping, sir. I was thinking.

07:38.808 --> 07:40.213
Oh, really?

07:40.214 --> 07:42.128
About what, exactly?

07:42.129 --> 07:45.705
The secrets of the cosmos, I suppose.

07:45.706 --> 07:48.004
I suggest you think about
trigonometry instead.

07:48.005 --> 07:49.344
With your eyes open.

07:49.345 --> 07:52.511
And sit up!

07:56.561 --> 08:00.199
Laws of Sines and Cosines.

08:00.200 --> 08:02.595
C-squared equals

08:02.596 --> 08:08.183
A-squared plus B-squared
subtract two-AB-cosine-C.

08:08.184 --> 08:09.939
Area of a triangle.

08:09.940 --> 08:15.366
Area equals C-squared Sine-A
Sine-B over two-Sine-C.

08:16.739 --> 08:21.048
What is the...

08:21.049 --> 08:24.279
...differential equation?

08:28.207 --> 08:31.241
Herr Einstein, are you still too busy

08:31.242 --> 08:33.509
contemplating the secrets of the cosmos

08:33.510 --> 08:35.169
to solve this equation?

08:35.171 --> 08:37.155
Oh, no, sir. I-I've already solved it.

08:38.171 --> 08:39.607
Leave. Now.

08:39.609 --> 08:40.884
On what offense?

08:40.885 --> 08:42.193
Your mere presence

08:42.195 --> 08:44.493
spoils the respect of the class for me!

08:44.494 --> 08:46.351
- That is not an objective reason!
- Out!

08:51.838 --> 08:55.380
The natural log of a constant
multiplied by X equals

08:55.381 --> 08:58.094
the natural log of one plus V-squared.

08:58.095 --> 09:00.009
And since V equals

09:00.010 --> 09:01.765
Y over X, that gives us

09:01.766 --> 09:04.544
the final function:
X-squared plus Y-squared

09:04.545 --> 09:07.640
minus C-X-cubed equals zero.

09:07.641 --> 09:09.301
And speaking truthfully, sir,

09:09.302 --> 09:11.505
your mere presence spoils
my respect for the future

09:11.506 --> 09:12.844
of Prussian mathematics.

09:12.845 --> 09:14.031
Out.

09:28.747 --> 09:30.157
Boots, pay attention.

09:33.568 --> 09:35.354
Well?

09:35.355 --> 09:37.845
What do you have to say for yourself?

09:37.846 --> 09:39.600
How do people get pleasure by

09:39.601 --> 09:41.964
marching in step? It makes me think

09:41.965 --> 09:44.294
they've been given their
big brains only by mistake.

09:44.295 --> 09:45.732
Turn around!

09:45.733 --> 09:48.892
Look at me.

09:48.893 --> 09:52.372
I want you to listen to
me very carefully, son.

09:52.373 --> 09:55.596
Rebellion will get you nowhere in life.

09:55.597 --> 09:57.321
You step on enough toes,

09:57.322 --> 10:00.227
and I promise you,
one day you will trip.

10:00.228 --> 10:02.196
I'm not going to apologize
for thinking that...

10:02.197 --> 10:03.480
That's exactly what you're going to do.

10:03.481 --> 10:06.293
The headmaster is willing
to give you one last chance,

10:06.294 --> 10:09.039
so I want you to go in
there and say you're sorry.

10:10.413 --> 10:12.072
Wait. No, Father, please.

10:12.073 --> 10:13.445
No, I can't.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.329
- You need an education.
- I agree!

10:15.330 --> 10:17.020
But blind regurgitation

10:17.021 --> 10:20.437
and rote memorization
is not an education.

10:20.438 --> 10:24.301
Let me study on my own, and
I promise I'll make you proud.

10:24.302 --> 10:25.897
How exactly will you do that, huh?

10:25.898 --> 10:28.163
Look around you. What do you see?

10:28.164 --> 10:30.591
- I see my impudent son.
- Yes, but

10:30.592 --> 10:32.506
what am I made of? Matter.

10:32.507 --> 10:35.092
And what keeps my feet
on the ground? Gravity.

10:35.093 --> 10:35.923
Oh, Albert,

10:35.924 --> 10:37.264
I don't have time for... This is not...

10:37.265 --> 10:39.626
Time, yes, that, too!
And light and magnetism.

10:39.627 --> 10:43.586
These invisible forces that
nobody fully understands.

10:43.587 --> 10:45.725
Where do they come from?
What are they made of?

10:45.726 --> 10:47.321
And why do they act as they do?

10:47.322 --> 10:49.683
I want to be the one who
solves those mysteries.

10:49.684 --> 10:52.557
Solving mysteries is not a vocation.

10:52.558 --> 10:54.793
But it is. I'm-I'm
going to be a physicist.

10:54.794 --> 10:57.250
No, not without a degree you won't!

10:57.251 --> 11:01.082
And if you get thrown out again,
I will not be here to save you.

11:01.083 --> 11:04.594
I don't need saving, Father.
No, I-I don't... mean that.

11:04.595 --> 11:07.857
I mean, I will not... be here at all.

11:10.565 --> 11:12.512
What are you talking about?

11:12.513 --> 11:17.307
Your mother, sister and
I are moving to Italy.

11:20.975 --> 11:22.889
Italy? I don't understand.

11:22.890 --> 11:23.974
- Why?
- Well...

11:23.975 --> 11:27.424
big demand for street lamps in Milan.

11:27.425 --> 11:30.106
But what about your business here?

11:30.107 --> 11:33.081
Our business is bankrupt.

11:36.364 --> 11:38.278
Why didn't you tell me?

11:38.279 --> 11:40.610
It is not your concern.

11:40.611 --> 11:42.589
- Let me come with you. Please.
- Albert. Albert.

11:42.590 --> 11:43.802
You don't speak Italian.

11:43.803 --> 11:45.749
How would you expect to go to school?

11:45.750 --> 11:47.028
I'll learn Italian. I'll Le...

11:47.029 --> 11:48.746
- I'll learn faster than anyone has ever
- Albert.

11:48.747 --> 11:50.412
Learned it before. So...

11:50.413 --> 11:52.488
- So you're abandoning me?
- No

11:52.489 --> 11:55.456
I'm looking out for your future.

11:55.457 --> 11:58.521
It's time you learn to be independent

11:58.522 --> 12:00.756
and take responsibility for yourself.

12:00.757 --> 12:01.970
You will live with your cousins

12:01.971 --> 12:05.066
until your studies are complete.

12:05.067 --> 12:08.488
Now go back to school.

12:15.225 --> 12:17.049
Pauline!

12:17.050 --> 12:18.847
Maja! The train will not wait

12:18.848 --> 12:20.572
- for your hair to be pinned up.
- Coming.

12:20.573 --> 12:21.854
Coming already.

12:30.183 --> 12:33.249
Albert, I left you two roast hens,

12:33.250 --> 12:34.781
green beans and potatoes.

12:34.782 --> 12:36.664
Oh, and I ordered extra milk delivery

12:36.665 --> 12:38.325
to your aunt's house,

12:38.326 --> 12:40.592
- so drink plenty. Come.
- I won't forget to eat, Mother.

12:41.773 --> 12:43.370
Oh

12:43.371 --> 12:45.700
I also left you

12:45.701 --> 12:46.817
a few extra marks.

12:46.818 --> 12:48.063
Don't tell your father.

12:48.064 --> 12:50.392
It's not his money, anyway.

12:50.393 --> 12:52.411
Make us proud.

12:55.120 --> 12:56.843
Come on, now, we must hurry.

12:56.844 --> 12:58.216
This is awful.

12:58.217 --> 13:00.712
I know. How will I ever sleep

13:00.713 --> 13:02.302
without your incessant snoring?

13:05.817 --> 13:07.380
Promise me you'll write.

13:07.381 --> 13:09.046
Of course, Maja.

13:16.353 --> 13:17.851
Driver.

13:17.852 --> 13:19.390
Hyah.

13:29.348 --> 13:32.155
Derivative of logarithmic functions.

13:32.156 --> 13:33.433
The X derivative

13:33.434 --> 13:34.869
of natural log X

13:34.870 --> 13:36.116
is one over X.

13:36.117 --> 13:37.487
One,

13:37.488 --> 13:39.244
two, three, four.

13:39.245 --> 13:40.073
Hydrogen.

13:40.074 --> 13:41.479
- One.
- Carbon

13:41.480 --> 13:42.628
Twelve.

13:42.629 --> 13:44.130
- Lithium.
- Seven.

13:44.131 --> 13:45.151
Nitrogen.

13:45.152 --> 13:46.587
Fourteen. J'aille.

13:46.588 --> 13:47.864
- Tu ailles.
- Come on, come on.

13:47.865 --> 13:49.493
Il aille. Nous allions.

13:49.494 --> 13:51.089
Vous alliez.

13:51.090 --> 13:52.079
Ils aillent.

13:52.080 --> 13:53.707
Double angle formulas.

13:53.708 --> 13:54.665
Sine 2 theta

13:54.666 --> 13:55.750
equals 2 sine theta...

13:56.965 --> 13:59.013
- ...cosine theta.
- Cosine.

13:59.902 --> 14:01.593
Cosine 2 theta equals cosine...

14:01.594 --> 14:02.743
No!

14:02.744 --> 14:04.403
I beg your pardon,

14:04.404 --> 14:05.202
Herr Einstein?

14:05.203 --> 14:06.286
I am feeling sick.

14:06.287 --> 14:08.464
I must go.

14:20.529 --> 14:22.507
60 beats per minute.

14:22.508 --> 14:23.784
- Normal.
- Take my temperature.

14:23.785 --> 14:25.124
I already did. It's normal.

14:25.125 --> 14:26.434
- Then take it again.
- Albert.

14:26.435 --> 14:28.317
I'm feeling feverish. I may faint.

14:28.318 --> 14:29.595
You're fine.

14:29.596 --> 14:31.183
Then I must have a rash somewhere.

14:31.184 --> 14:32.405
Albert, what's going on?

14:32.406 --> 14:34.064
I'm not asking as your doctor,

14:34.065 --> 14:36.331
but as a friend of your family.

14:36.332 --> 14:39.110
I must leave Germany, Dr. Talmud.

14:39.111 --> 14:40.738
Uh-huh.

14:40.739 --> 14:43.132
Your father wants you to stay.

14:43.133 --> 14:45.399
My father doesn't understand me.

14:45.400 --> 14:46.644
Chin up.

14:46.645 --> 14:48.242
It's only two more years.

14:48.243 --> 14:50.795
Maybe to you two years feels
like the blink of an eye,

14:50.796 --> 14:52.233
but to me, it's an eternity.

14:52.234 --> 14:54.627
I don't mean that literally, of course.

14:54.628 --> 14:57.947
Everybody knows that time can't
move at two different speeds.

14:57.948 --> 15:01.338
What do you want me to do? Hmm?

15:03.727 --> 15:06.860
Deem me medically
unfit to finish school.

15:07.750 --> 15:10.176
For what reason?

15:10.177 --> 15:12.187
The Prussian malaise?

15:12.188 --> 15:14.486
Nervous breakdown will do.

15:36.134 --> 15:38.209
Spelt, milk, and do not forget the...

15:38.210 --> 15:40.922
Eggs. Yes, please, I heard you.

15:40.923 --> 15:42.743
I'm late. Eggs, eggs, eggs.

15:42.744 --> 15:44.818
I can't afford to be
late. I always ha...

15:44.819 --> 15:47.312
Buongiorno, Papa.

15:48.846 --> 15:51.511
That is the extent of
my Italian thus far.

15:51.512 --> 15:54.703
You were right. It is a
difficult language to grasp.

15:54.704 --> 15:56.141
Why are you not in school?

15:56.142 --> 15:57.832
I've decided to go

15:57.833 --> 15:59.333
to Zurich Polytechnic instead.

15:59.334 --> 16:02.622
Zurich Polytechnic? No,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

16:02.623 --> 16:05.081
You cannot expect to enter university

16:05.082 --> 16:07.061
- without finishing your studies.
- They'll admit me...

16:07.062 --> 16:09.678
if I pass the entrance exam in June.

16:09.679 --> 16:11.850
I-I was hoping I
could stay here with...

16:11.851 --> 16:13.606
with you and Mother and Maja

16:13.607 --> 16:14.754
while I study.

16:14.755 --> 16:16.000
Hermann, who are you talking to?

16:16.001 --> 16:17.117
- Hello, Mother.
- Oh.

16:17.118 --> 16:18.241
Albert.

16:19.257 --> 16:21.779
- Hermann, let the boy in.
- No.

16:21.780 --> 16:23.919
He will go back to Munich immediately

16:23.920 --> 16:24.990
and finish his studies.

16:24.991 --> 16:26.997
- And that is an order.
- I'm sorry, Father,

16:26.998 --> 16:29.328
but I'm not going back to Germany.

16:29.329 --> 16:31.404
Ever again.

16:31.405 --> 16:34.570
All right, let us all open our eyes...

16:35.460 --> 16:38.083
...and return to Germany.

16:45.428 --> 16:48.687
Here is our traveling light beam.

16:48.688 --> 16:51.145
Now, I will ask you again.

16:51.146 --> 16:52.741
How can something... light...

16:52.742 --> 16:55.933
travel through nothing... space?

16:55.934 --> 16:57.339
It cannot,

16:57.340 --> 16:58.424
Herr Professor.

16:58.425 --> 16:59.860
Cannot. Good.

16:59.861 --> 17:01.810
Therefore, if light
is only a wave, then...

17:01.811 --> 17:03.054
Space is not empty?

17:03.055 --> 17:04.809
Exactly.

17:04.810 --> 17:06.759
So just as sound waves
travel through air,

17:06.760 --> 17:11.483
light waves must travel through
some sort of medium in space.

17:11.483 --> 17:14.357
Scientists called it the ether,

17:14.358 --> 17:16.847
an invisible

17:16.848 --> 17:19.880
but all-encompassing substance

17:19.881 --> 17:22.122
pervading the universe.

17:24.446 --> 17:27.065
I believed in it when I was your age.

17:27.066 --> 17:28.278
Trust me.

17:28.279 --> 17:30.736
I knew everything.

17:31.918 --> 17:33.099
But as it turns out,

17:33.100 --> 17:34.855
I was wrong.

17:36.165 --> 17:38.367
Walther Rathenau is dead.

17:38.368 --> 17:40.388
Assassinated in the street.

17:49.894 --> 17:51.905
I just saw him yesterday.

17:51.906 --> 17:55.769
He was coming to dinner on Sunday.

17:58.291 --> 17:59.536
I'll get it.

17:59.537 --> 18:00.930
That's quite all right, Fraulein.

18:00.931 --> 18:02.280
If you don't mind,

18:02.281 --> 18:04.548
I'd like some time
alone with my husband.

18:11.734 --> 18:13.679
Why did you send her away?

18:13.680 --> 18:15.723
I don't want to be
disturbed by the press.

18:15.724 --> 18:17.256
I need Betty to answer the phone.

18:17.257 --> 18:19.811
I know why you need Betty.

18:21.791 --> 18:23.322
And that is not the press. It's Mileva.

18:23.323 --> 18:24.924
She's been calling all morning.

18:26.452 --> 18:27.697
Why should I talk to her?

18:27.698 --> 18:30.410
She brings us nothing
but misery and pain.

18:30.411 --> 18:32.842
We have enough of that as it is.

18:44.396 --> 18:46.630
Where are you going?

18:46.631 --> 18:47.684
My study.

18:47.685 --> 18:48.737
Please don't.

18:48.738 --> 18:49.822
Don't what?

18:49.823 --> 18:51.355
Do what you always do.

18:51.356 --> 18:53.654
Hide in your work.

18:53.655 --> 18:56.981
Your friend just died.

18:57.837 --> 19:00.077
You need to grieve.

19:11.791 --> 19:15.205
Machine gun...

19:15.206 --> 19:18.558
and grenade.

19:18.559 --> 19:20.984
What sort of animals would do this?

19:20.985 --> 19:25.364
You know exactly what sort of animals.

19:26.221 --> 19:28.780
Death to the Elders of Zion!

19:33.406 --> 19:34.427
Hold.

19:36.055 --> 19:38.418
We die for our ideals!

20:25.448 --> 20:27.907
The revolution is coming,

20:27.908 --> 20:29.860
and Germany will rise again.

20:49.076 --> 20:51.343
Good day, Frau Einstein.

20:51.344 --> 20:53.289
Captain Muller. Berlin Police.

20:53.290 --> 20:56.424
Is your husband at home?

20:57.281 --> 20:59.803
Good day, Herr Professor.

20:59.804 --> 21:01.080
It's an honor to meet you,

21:01.081 --> 21:03.220
though I regret the circumstances.

21:03.221 --> 21:06.252
I understand you and
Minister Rathenau were close.

21:06.253 --> 21:08.710
We were. Thank you.

21:08.711 --> 21:10.691
You may have heard that
we located and killed

21:10.692 --> 21:12.414
Minister Rathenau's assassins.

21:12.415 --> 21:13.756
Who were they?

21:13.757 --> 21:15.512
The members of a fringe group

21:15.513 --> 21:17.269
called the Organization Consul.

21:17.270 --> 21:19.472
What is your definition
of "fringe," Captain?

21:19.473 --> 21:20.588
A hundred members?

21:20.589 --> 21:21.834
Ten members? A thousand?

21:21.835 --> 21:23.302
Elsa.

21:23.303 --> 21:25.378
You're not here to
offer your condolences,

21:25.379 --> 21:26.814
are you, Captain?

21:26.815 --> 21:30.263
No, sir, I'm not.

21:30.264 --> 21:31.923
In the possession of the assassins,

21:31.924 --> 21:33.614
we found a list of targets.

21:33.615 --> 21:35.722
Minister Rathenau's
name was on that list,

21:35.723 --> 21:37.388
and so was yours, Herr Professor.

21:39.428 --> 21:41.628
These men are part of a larger movement.

21:41.629 --> 21:45.466
I'm afraid it may not be safe
for you to remain in Berlin.

21:51.217 --> 21:52.717
I'll call the movers in the morning.

21:52.718 --> 21:56.357
They can have the
apartment packed by Friday.

21:56.358 --> 21:58.624
We can go to the Baltic
Sea for the summer.

21:58.625 --> 22:00.347
That would give us a chance to consider

22:00.348 --> 22:01.725
a more permanent option.

22:03.765 --> 22:05.782
Albert, are you even listening to me?

22:08.874 --> 22:10.404
We're not going anywhere, Elsa.

22:10.405 --> 22:12.544
Did you hear what the man
said? You're on a list.

22:12.545 --> 22:13.501
The killers are dead.

22:13.502 --> 22:15.481
- And they have accomplices.
- No

22:15.482 --> 22:17.269
I will not kowtow to bullies.

22:17.270 --> 22:20.531
And I will not sit by and wait
for fascists to kill my husband.

22:23.017 --> 22:26.209
I want to leave, Albert. Please.

22:26.210 --> 22:28.987
You don't even like Germany.

22:28.988 --> 22:30.872
This is not about Germany.

22:30.873 --> 22:33.201
Elsa, this is about my work,

22:33.202 --> 22:34.989
my colleagues at the Academy,

22:34.990 --> 22:37.257
our friends, my sailboat,

22:37.258 --> 22:40.162
this apartment. Our life.

22:40.163 --> 22:42.875
It's all here. It's home.

22:42.876 --> 22:45.079
That's what Walther
Rathenau thought, too.

22:45.080 --> 22:48.240
Walther was killed because
he was a politician.

22:48.241 --> 22:49.517
I'm only a scientist.

22:49.518 --> 22:51.534
And you're both Jews.

22:53.893 --> 22:56.127
Where on God's Earth would you go?

22:56.128 --> 22:58.043
I have teaching offers abroad.

22:58.044 --> 23:00.086
Oxford. Princeton.

23:00.087 --> 23:03.279
Ha! I've known you for
over a decade, Albert.

23:03.280 --> 23:04.971
You despise British formality,

23:04.972 --> 23:07.078
you despise American exceptionalism.

23:07.079 --> 23:08.514
I also despise

23:08.515 --> 23:09.759
German nationalism.

23:09.760 --> 23:12.027
So do most Germans.

23:12.028 --> 23:14.933
The country has declared
a national holiday

23:14.934 --> 23:17.934
for Walther's funeral
tomorrow, for God's sake.

23:17.935 --> 23:20.558
Elsa is overreacting.

23:21.829 --> 23:23.744
Do you know what I find extraordinary

23:23.745 --> 23:25.500
about you, Fritz Haber?

23:25.501 --> 23:27.256
It might be my brilliant mind

23:27.257 --> 23:30.065
or my scintillating
wit, but knowing you,

23:30.066 --> 23:31.950
you're not about to flatter me.

23:31.951 --> 23:35.942
That you see yourself as one
of them, and not as one of us.

23:35.943 --> 23:38.016
One of us?

23:38.017 --> 23:39.644
You talk like a Zionist.

23:39.645 --> 23:41.305
No, I'm a realist.

23:41.306 --> 23:43.380
And I'm a German patriot,

23:43.381 --> 23:46.318
a proud war veteran,
and a devout Christian.

23:46.319 --> 23:47.691
Really, Fritz?

23:47.692 --> 23:49.734
You're proud of your military service?

23:49.735 --> 23:53.022
You may have changed your
religion, but don't think

23:53.023 --> 23:55.034
for a second you can
change your heritage.

23:55.035 --> 23:57.078
Is that how you really see me?

23:57.079 --> 23:59.408
As some sort of fraud?

23:59.409 --> 24:01.995
No, no. It's not how
I see you that matters.

24:01.996 --> 24:04.772
It's how men like this Adolf
Hitler character see you.

24:04.773 --> 24:07.104
Adolf Hitler is a
loud-mouthed art school reject

24:07.105 --> 24:08.412
with a handful of supporters

24:08.413 --> 24:11.157
in country of 60 million.

24:11.158 --> 24:12.722
He'll be gone in a year.

24:12.723 --> 24:16.431
Tell that to the
esteemed Professor Lenard.

24:17.672 --> 24:19.396
Read it to me.

24:19.397 --> 24:21.216
"Albert Einstein

24:21.217 --> 24:23.354
"should hereby be barred

24:23.355 --> 24:26.611
"from attending the annual
conference for German science

24:26.612 --> 24:28.654
"on grounds that his
theory of relativity

24:28.655 --> 24:32.390
offends against the common
sense of scientists."

24:32.391 --> 24:34.945
I'm quite certain it
took him all the restraint

24:34.946 --> 24:37.467
he could muster not
to refer to relativity

24:37.468 --> 24:39.351
as a Jewish theory.

24:39.352 --> 24:40.946
Forget Lenard.

24:40.947 --> 24:43.502
- He's just jealous of your success.
- Perhaps.

24:43.503 --> 24:45.640
But look how many others have signed it.

24:45.641 --> 24:49.349
People are listening to him, Fritz.

24:50.431 --> 24:52.984
He's dangerous.

24:52.985 --> 24:55.027
Please, Professor Lenard, I beg of you.

24:55.028 --> 24:56.816
It's only one day of classes.

24:56.817 --> 24:58.220
I couldn't agree more.

24:58.221 --> 24:59.625
That's why I'm choosing to teach.

24:59.626 --> 25:02.499
But a national day of
mourning has been declared.

25:02.500 --> 25:05.564
The University of
Heidelberg must respect it.

25:05.565 --> 25:07.800
A national day of mourning
for a Bolshevik Jew

25:07.801 --> 25:10.385
who bankrupted our nation
and left behind a generation

25:10.386 --> 25:13.674
of jobless young men? No, thank you.

25:13.675 --> 25:17.146
The death of Walther Rathenau
should be cause for celebration,

25:17.147 --> 25:18.226
not mourning.

25:18.227 --> 25:19.663
- Professor.
- No.

25:19.664 --> 25:21.674
This funeral is a garish spectacle

25:21.675 --> 25:25.121
led by left-wing radicals
like Albert Einstein

25:25.122 --> 25:27.326
to paint German patriots as criminals.

25:27.327 --> 25:29.178
Philipp, I'm begging you.

25:29.179 --> 25:30.518
As your friend.

25:30.519 --> 25:33.423
Don't let old skirmishes
cloud your vision.

25:33.424 --> 25:35.500
If that is what you think this is, sir,

25:35.501 --> 25:37.515
then we are not friends.

25:59.383 --> 26:00.600
Stand!

26:08.770 --> 26:11.003
Gentlemen,

26:11.004 --> 26:13.813
there is a new war festering.

26:13.814 --> 26:16.143
A war against reason,

26:16.144 --> 26:18.283
against clarity,

26:18.284 --> 26:21.156
against this very institution.

26:21.157 --> 26:23.908
Germany and German
physics are under threat.

26:28.246 --> 26:30.990
Quite the turnout for a Jew,

26:30.991 --> 26:32.490
wouldn't you say?

26:32.491 --> 26:35.812
Our forefathers based their science

26:35.813 --> 26:38.206
on experimentation and fact.

26:38.207 --> 26:39.834
Not artificial formulae

26:39.835 --> 26:42.771
based on arbitrary definition

26:42.772 --> 26:45.103
or publicity-seeking fabrications

26:45.104 --> 26:47.592
of space and time.

26:47.593 --> 26:48.678
Einstein.

26:50.276 --> 26:51.904
- Einstein.
- Einstein?

26:51.905 --> 26:53.309
Einstein.

26:53.310 --> 26:54.841
This foreign influence has been

26:54.842 --> 26:56.661
gaining momentum for far too long.

26:56.662 --> 26:58.512
And it is your job,

26:58.513 --> 27:01.961
as the future of this great nation,

27:01.962 --> 27:03.845
to protect our Aryan respect

27:03.846 --> 27:05.920
for empirical observation.

27:05.921 --> 27:08.730
Abstruse theories devoid of reality

27:08.731 --> 27:10.710
have no place in our field.

27:10.711 --> 27:13.775
If we do not fight against
them, I promise you,

27:13.776 --> 27:16.169
the foreigner will spread
through these hallowed halls

27:16.170 --> 27:19.553
like a virus. And before
we have time to react,

27:19.554 --> 27:22.363
German physics will be no more.

27:22.364 --> 27:25.332
It is time to stand up, gentlemen.

27:25.333 --> 27:28.494
Stand up for Germany!

27:42.480 --> 27:45.447
Excuse me. Dr. Einstein?

27:45.448 --> 27:47.810
We would just like to say

27:47.811 --> 27:51.417
that we are deeply sorry
for the loss of your friend.

27:51.418 --> 27:54.355
And we want you to
know that we are proud

27:54.356 --> 27:57.995
to call men such as Minister
Rathenau and yourself

27:57.996 --> 27:59.822
our compatriots.

28:06.776 --> 28:08.793
Nice to meet you, Professor Einstein.

28:14.152 --> 28:15.557
It's an honor, sir.

28:15.558 --> 28:17.855
Rathenau's killers are German heroes!

28:17.856 --> 28:21.303
Rathenau's killers are German heroes!

28:21.304 --> 28:24.784
Rathenau's killers are German heroes!

28:24.785 --> 28:27.434
- Rathenau's killers are German heroes!
- We should leave. Now.

28:28.037 --> 28:29.569
No.

28:29.570 --> 28:32.339
We're not going home
until the funeral is over.

28:32.340 --> 28:34.318
And we're not leaving Germany.

28:34.319 --> 28:35.788
Albert.

28:35.789 --> 28:37.166
If we leave...

28:38.884 --> 28:40.257
...they win.

28:40.258 --> 28:41.695
...German heroes!

28:41.696 --> 28:44.351
Killers are German heroes!

29:30.673 --> 29:32.689
Herr Einstein?

29:41.401 --> 29:43.315
- I am Professor...
- Weber.

29:43.316 --> 29:45.998
Heinrich Weber. Chair of the
physics department, I know.

29:45.999 --> 29:48.712
I... I read your paper
on heat conduction.

29:48.713 --> 29:50.979
It seems you have read
quite a few papers,

29:50.980 --> 29:53.660
young man.

29:53.661 --> 29:56.502
You passed the mathematics
and science sections

29:56.503 --> 29:57.908
with flying colors.

29:57.909 --> 29:59.280
Where did you learn all of this?

29:59.281 --> 30:01.419
- I am self-taught, Herr Professor.
- Ah.

30:01.420 --> 30:03.112
That makes sense.

30:03.113 --> 30:04.324
Why is that?

30:04.325 --> 30:06.720
Because you failed everything else.

30:06.721 --> 30:08.858
Literature, zoology,

30:08.859 --> 30:10.584
botany, French, politics,

30:10.585 --> 30:12.594
to be specific.

30:12.595 --> 30:17.159
That's... that's quite a few subjects.

30:17.160 --> 30:20.102
Indeed.

30:21.408 --> 30:23.992
Oh, my father...

30:23.993 --> 30:27.154
Can you make an exception, sir?
I-I only want to study physics.

30:27.155 --> 30:29.100
No, that is not how a university works.

30:29.101 --> 30:30.890
But literature is a pastime.

30:30.891 --> 30:33.027
I-I've never been to a zoo in my life.

30:33.028 --> 30:34.848
Botany I place under
the same sub-section

30:34.849 --> 30:36.699
as literature... bourgeois.

30:36.700 --> 30:38.169
And French, well...

30:38.170 --> 30:39.670
pourquoi, sir?

30:39.671 --> 30:42.320
You forgot about politics.

30:42.321 --> 30:44.041
Politics are frivolous.
They're only a matter

30:44.042 --> 30:46.790
of present concern. But
a mathematical equation,

30:46.791 --> 30:50.085
Professor, well... that stands forever.

30:54.038 --> 30:55.954
I tell you what,

30:55.955 --> 30:58.027
I am going to bend the rules

30:58.028 --> 30:59.720
and invite you to audit my classes

30:59.721 --> 31:01.349
and to work in my laboratory.

31:01.350 --> 31:03.106
Will I be an official student?

31:03.107 --> 31:04.158
No.

31:04.159 --> 31:06.744
I need to earn a degree, sir.

31:06.745 --> 31:08.628
Because without one,

31:08.629 --> 31:11.316
I'll never be taken
seriously as a physicist.

31:12.876 --> 31:16.010
And I'll never get an
office like this, will I?

31:18.271 --> 31:20.219
There is a good school

31:20.220 --> 31:22.069
25 miles west of here. I know a teacher

31:22.070 --> 31:24.752
who will take you in.
You study for a year,

31:24.753 --> 31:26.827
well, you go to a zoo,
you learn some French,

31:26.828 --> 31:28.839
and then you'll come back here

31:28.840 --> 31:30.435
and you'll retake the exam.

31:30.436 --> 31:32.612
I won't disappoint you, sir.

32:12.359 --> 32:14.624
- Get the door!
- No, you get the door!

32:14.625 --> 32:17.026
- I'm doing homework!
- Liar, you're in the bathroom!

32:17.027 --> 32:19.549
- I have cramps!
- She always says that.

32:19.550 --> 32:21.565
Everyone relax. I'll get it.

32:24.020 --> 32:26.190
Hello. May I help you?

32:26.191 --> 32:29.383
Yes. I... I am...

32:29.384 --> 32:30.723
Well, spit it out, then.

32:30.724 --> 32:31.936
Buzz off, you gnat.

32:31.937 --> 32:33.500
Mother! Marie called me a gnat!

32:33.501 --> 32:34.810
I must apologize.

32:34.811 --> 32:36.184
Oh, my God.

32:36.185 --> 32:38.257
- Marie has a boyfriend.
- What?

32:38.258 --> 32:40.368
- Paul!
- I'm so sorry.

32:40.369 --> 32:41.675
Who are you?

32:41.676 --> 32:42.760
Marie's boyfriend.

32:42.761 --> 32:44.005
Mathias, shut it.

32:44.006 --> 32:45.729
Marie has a boyfriend? Since when?

32:45.730 --> 32:47.103
Do you have brothers and sisters?

32:47.104 --> 32:48.577
Anna, you said you couldn't do dishes

32:48.578 --> 32:49.561
because you had cramps.

32:49.562 --> 32:50.679
I do, but look A real boy.

32:50.680 --> 32:51.795
Who are you?

32:51.796 --> 32:52.977
I already asked him.

32:52.978 --> 32:55.371
Yes. Right. I-I am...

32:55.372 --> 32:57.127
Albert Einstein.

32:57.128 --> 32:59.459
Your reputation precedes you.

32:59.460 --> 33:01.469
Disobedient son,

33:01.470 --> 33:03.321
perennial truant,

33:03.322 --> 33:06.228
unrepentant flouter of authority.

33:06.229 --> 33:07.441
Please, please, sir, I can explain.

33:07.442 --> 33:09.101
I'm not chastising you.

33:09.102 --> 33:12.230
I'm congratulating you.

33:12.231 --> 33:14.017
We Wintelers respect a true rebel.

33:14.018 --> 33:16.860
You are welcome here
for as long as you like.

33:16.861 --> 33:18.040
Thank you, sir.

33:18.041 --> 33:19.670
Julius, Show him in.

33:19.671 --> 33:21.304
Quick.

33:22.512 --> 33:24.203
Thank you.

33:24.204 --> 33:25.576
Darling, Albert is here.

33:25.577 --> 33:26.853
And I quote...

33:29.696 --> 33:32.090
...understand the things
of nature as philosophers,

33:32.091 --> 33:34.930
and not to stare at them
in astonishment like fools,

33:34.931 --> 33:37.293
are soon considered
heretical and impious.

33:37.294 --> 33:39.208
Oh, please, Baruch Spinoza is a buffoon,

33:39.209 --> 33:40.583
not a philosopher.

33:40.584 --> 33:42.205
At least Descartes was a military man.

33:42.206 --> 33:43.072
Oh, here we go again.

33:43.073 --> 33:44.478
Piss off, Anna.

33:44.479 --> 33:45.851
Julius, language.

33:45.852 --> 33:47.095
Fine.

33:47.096 --> 33:49.011
Albert, eat.

33:49.012 --> 33:50.794
But did you know that
Spinoza never taught

33:50.795 --> 33:52.076
a day in his life?

33:52.077 --> 33:54.567
He was a lowly optical lens grinder.

33:54.568 --> 33:56.994
Why should someone's
vocation define his intellect?

33:56.995 --> 33:59.036
- Well said, darling.
- Thank you.

33:59.037 --> 34:01.399
Fine, fine, but his
treatise on God is hearsay.

34:01.400 --> 34:02.836
"Natura Naturans?" Please.

34:02.837 --> 34:04.464
And what does it even mean?

34:04.465 --> 34:06.923
It means God and Nature
are one and the same.

34:06.924 --> 34:09.476
I am a certified teacher now,
if you need a Latin tutor.

34:09.478 --> 34:11.681
Very funny.

34:11.681 --> 34:13.409
Albert may take you up on that.

34:16.663 --> 34:18.831
I will?

34:18.833 --> 34:21.067
Professor Weber tells
me you need a little help

34:21.068 --> 34:22.664
in the humanities.

34:22.665 --> 34:25.025
Is that why you are so silent tonight?

34:25.027 --> 34:28.284
My opinions are usually unwelcome.

34:28.284 --> 34:30.646
Not here, they aren't. Speak.

34:30.647 --> 34:32.562
Yes, speak, Albert. We want to hear it.

34:32.563 --> 34:34.157
Speak. Albert, speak.

34:34.158 --> 34:37.420
Yes. We really want to hear it.

34:46.929 --> 34:49.994
From a scientific perspective,

34:49.995 --> 34:52.643
what Marie said is very exciting...

34:52.645 --> 34:55.422
- and-and, well, funny enough,
- "Very exciting."

34:55.424 --> 34:58.902
it's an idea I've been
considering for a while now.

34:58.903 --> 35:01.903
"Natura Naturans."

35:01.904 --> 35:04.808
Everything is connected.

35:04.809 --> 35:07.555
Nature isn't a product of God,

35:07.556 --> 35:09.631
nature is God.

35:09.632 --> 35:13.110
And if we suppose that's true,
well, then, we must conclude

35:13.111 --> 35:17.070
the universe isn't some
mystical netherworld

35:17.071 --> 35:18.890
outside our grasp of understanding.

35:18.891 --> 35:22.402
From the smallest molecule
to the largest galaxy...

35:22.403 --> 35:25.723
every question must
have a definable answer.

35:25.724 --> 35:27.701
And, well,

35:27.702 --> 35:30.830
I intend to find those answers.

35:30.831 --> 35:34.558
Well, that is the most hedonistic thing

35:34.559 --> 35:36.570
I have heard all night.

35:36.571 --> 35:37.713
Show us a bit of respect, Julius.

35:37.714 --> 35:40.938
- Julius, don't be rude.
- There are no more potatoes.

35:40.939 --> 35:42.828
Thank you so much.

36:09.323 --> 36:11.462
Newton's second law of motion.

36:11.463 --> 36:13.058
You all know it,

36:13.059 --> 36:16.378
but as we delve deeper
into Newtonian mechanics,

36:16.379 --> 36:19.731
I need you to more than "know" it.

36:19.732 --> 36:22.731
I need you to be able to see it.

36:22.732 --> 36:25.510
So when I ask, what is acceleration?

36:25.511 --> 36:27.680
Don't immediately think "numbers."

36:27.681 --> 36:29.921
Instead, close your eyes...

36:32.791 --> 36:35.120
Good.

36:35.121 --> 36:37.100
And imagine a ball

36:37.101 --> 36:39.494
being shot across the sky.

36:39.495 --> 36:43.708
Now imagine an identical
ball in outer space

36:43.709 --> 36:47.572
racing with the ball on Earth,
with the same force applied.

36:47.573 --> 36:51.467
Which ball would win a race?

36:51.468 --> 36:54.277
You don't need to raise your
hand to speak here, Albert.

36:54.278 --> 36:57.092
Oh. Really? Well...

36:59.451 --> 37:01.461
Uh, the ball in outer space would win

37:01.462 --> 37:02.962
'cause it's travelling in a vacuum.

37:02.963 --> 37:05.516
But I have another question.

37:05.517 --> 37:06.984
Go on.

37:06.985 --> 37:08.326
Well,

37:08.327 --> 37:09.923
now I'm imagining

37:09.924 --> 37:13.376
that the ball is
traveling in deep space...

37:19.151 --> 37:21.454
...with...

37:30.358 --> 37:33.460
...with no stars or planets around it.

37:34.827 --> 37:37.859
Acceleration is the
derivative of velocity

37:37.860 --> 37:39.903
with respect to time.

37:39.904 --> 37:42.778
How do we know that the
ball is moving at all

37:42.779 --> 37:45.683
if there's nothing to
compare its motions to?

37:45.684 --> 37:48.395
In other words...

37:48.396 --> 37:51.371
what is time?

37:52.708 --> 37:54.723
And for that matter...

37:56.634 --> 37:59.859
what is space?

37:59.860 --> 38:02.253
Newton's Principia, Volume One:

38:02.254 --> 38:04.840
"Absolute, true, and
mathematical time, of itself

38:04.841 --> 38:06.563
and from its own nature, flows..."

38:06.564 --> 38:08.990
"Equitably without relation
to anything external."

38:08.991 --> 38:10.427
Time and space are absolute, I know.

38:10.428 --> 38:12.087
Yes, well, then, let's move on.

38:12.088 --> 38:13.995
But when pressed on the
subject of absoluteness,

38:13.996 --> 38:17.260
Newton said, "The Deity endures forever,

38:17.261 --> 38:20.739
"and by existing always and everywhere,

38:20.740 --> 38:23.516
He constitutes duration and space."

38:23.517 --> 38:26.774
Which, in short, is saying...

38:26.775 --> 38:30.610
"I have no idea, but
God must, so there."

38:35.491 --> 38:36.767
Albert.

38:36.768 --> 38:38.045
I-I know. I sh... I should go.

38:38.046 --> 38:39.680
Sit down.

38:41.717 --> 38:45.134
Well, it looks like we are going

38:45.135 --> 38:47.980
to have an interesting year.

38:53.850 --> 38:56.148
So let us move on to the next chapter.

38:56.149 --> 38:59.436
When we are looking at Newton
and some of his other ideas...

38:59.437 --> 39:00.778
Here you are, sir.

39:00.779 --> 39:02.215
Thank you.

39:02.216 --> 39:04.131
"The surest way to corrupt a youth

39:04.132 --> 39:06.461
"is to hold in higher esteem

39:06.462 --> 39:07.707
"those who think alike

39:07.708 --> 39:09.253
than those who think differently."

39:09.254 --> 39:10.355
Nietzsche?

39:10.356 --> 39:11.824
Excellent.

39:11.825 --> 39:14.827
"If you step on enough
toes, one day you'll trip."

39:14.828 --> 39:16.199
Confucius?

39:16.200 --> 39:18.403
Close. My father.

39:18.404 --> 39:19.774
Albert.

39:19.775 --> 39:22.648
A letter for you. Looks official.

39:22.649 --> 39:24.116
I don't believe it.

39:24.117 --> 39:25.974
What is it?

39:33.601 --> 39:36.256
My application to renounce
my German citizenship.

39:39.923 --> 39:41.550
It's been approved.

39:41.551 --> 39:43.434
I'm officially stateless.

39:43.435 --> 39:45.382
So now you have no passport?

39:45.383 --> 39:47.137
That seems reckless.

39:47.138 --> 39:48.511
Why would you do that?

39:48.512 --> 39:51.161
Because nationalism is
an infantile disease.

39:51.162 --> 39:52.726
The measles of mankind.

39:52.727 --> 39:54.519
Where on Earth did you get such an idea?

39:56.366 --> 39:58.313
Papa, you didn't.

39:58.314 --> 39:59.622
I'm proud of you, Albert.

39:59.623 --> 40:01.921
Now you are a citizen of the world.

40:01.922 --> 40:04.029
- Let us celebrate.
- Sorry, that will have to wait.

40:04.030 --> 40:05.368
Albert and I have work to do.

40:05.369 --> 40:07.554
"And though she be but
little, she is fierce."

40:07.555 --> 40:09.044
William Shakespeare.

40:09.045 --> 40:10.244
Good luck.

40:21.337 --> 40:22.740
Are you listening to me?

40:22.741 --> 40:23.921
Of course.

40:23.922 --> 40:25.168
You were sleeping.

40:25.169 --> 40:26.923
I wasn't. I promise.

40:26.924 --> 40:29.548
I was having the most wonderful thought.

40:30.308 --> 40:32.191
Oh, yes? And what was that?

40:32.192 --> 40:35.256
It's been bothering
me for over a year now.

40:35.257 --> 40:39.727
How does something...
travel through nothing?

40:39.728 --> 40:42.695
What are you talking about, Albert?

40:42.696 --> 40:45.378
I... I-I imagined I was riding

40:45.379 --> 40:48.475
alongside a light beam.

40:48.476 --> 40:50.389
Guess what happened?

40:50.390 --> 40:52.115
I have no idea.

40:52.116 --> 40:53.456
Let me show you.

40:53.457 --> 40:54.573
Come.

40:54.574 --> 40:55.691
Ah...

40:55.692 --> 40:57.382
Come on!

40:57.383 --> 40:58.730
Come!

41:01.992 --> 41:03.811
Imagine I'm a light beam

41:03.812 --> 41:05.887
traveling to Earth. Now catch me!

41:05.888 --> 41:07.324
How fast must we go?

41:07.325 --> 41:09.781
About 300,000 kilometers a second.

41:09.782 --> 41:11.409
Albert! You are mad!

41:11.410 --> 41:12.656
No, I'm a wave.

41:12.657 --> 41:13.869
Traveling through the ether.

41:13.870 --> 41:15.183
Come on!

41:17.509 --> 41:19.552
Come on!

41:19.553 --> 41:21.601
Catch me!

41:43.978 --> 41:45.637
As you catch up to me,

41:45.638 --> 41:47.010
the strangest thing happens:

41:47.011 --> 41:48.990
I appear to slow down. Am I right?

41:53.429 --> 41:55.120
But here is the best part...

41:55.121 --> 41:56.716
When you are traveling the speed

41:56.717 --> 42:00.005
of light alongside the wave... me...

42:00.006 --> 42:02.527
I appear...

42:02.528 --> 42:04.059
frozen in time.

42:04.060 --> 42:06.391
Is that it?

42:06.392 --> 42:09.200
Well, so far, yes.

43:39.836 --> 43:42.364
Have you read this?

43:43.350 --> 43:44.434
Yes.

43:44.435 --> 43:46.828
Hitler didn't win.

43:46.829 --> 43:49.158
He won 230 seats.

43:49.159 --> 43:50.436
That's almost a majority.

43:50.437 --> 43:52.287
Elsa, please.

43:52.288 --> 43:53.597
Not now.

43:53.598 --> 43:54.810
Albert, you've been saying "not now"

43:54.811 --> 43:55.959
for ten years.

43:55.960 --> 43:57.269
You know why?

43:57.270 --> 43:59.473
Because my old friend Sir Isaac Newton

43:59.474 --> 44:01.579
was really right about some things.

44:01.580 --> 44:04.326
An object at rest really
does tend to stay at rest.

44:04.327 --> 44:06.343
Albert, this is not a joke.

44:07.774 --> 44:08.955
Where are you going?

44:08.956 --> 44:10.966
- I need tobacco.
- No.

44:10.967 --> 44:12.947
I-It's not safe. I'll send someone.

44:12.948 --> 44:14.318
I'm an able man.

44:14.319 --> 44:16.905
And I am scared.

44:16.906 --> 44:18.694
When Walther was murdered,

44:18.695 --> 44:21.088
you chose to stay, and I accepted.

44:21.089 --> 44:22.332
It was brave

44:22.333 --> 44:23.865
and defiant.

44:23.866 --> 44:25.813
But this is different.

44:25.814 --> 44:27.472
Enough already, Albert.

44:27.473 --> 44:29.075
Everything is fine.

44:30.188 --> 44:32.200
Hitler did not win.

44:56.050 --> 44:58.572
One loaf per family.

44:58.573 --> 45:00.939
Move along. One loaf per family.

45:01.798 --> 45:03.202
Keep moving.

45:03.203 --> 45:04.670
Afternoon, Ernst.

45:04.671 --> 45:08.629
I took your advice and
listened to Erik Satie.

45:08.630 --> 45:12.972
Little too French for
me, but you were right.

45:12.973 --> 45:15.941
His ability to evoke complex emotions

45:15.942 --> 45:18.878
with simplicity is remarkable.

45:18.879 --> 45:20.794
Though I must admit I am surprised

45:20.795 --> 45:22.932
that a Wagnerian such as yourself

45:22.933 --> 45:27.249
should enjoy experimental minimalism.

45:29.384 --> 45:32.065
Is everything all right, Ernst?

45:32.066 --> 45:34.682
Yes, Professor. Of course.

45:34.683 --> 45:38.513
Well, that will be all for today.

45:38.514 --> 45:40.978
Elsa has me cutting back.

45:50.168 --> 45:53.010
It is only because

45:53.011 --> 45:54.862
my customers requested them.

45:54.863 --> 45:58.731
Everyone has a choice, Ernst.

46:11.255 --> 46:12.275
Oh, no.

46:12.276 --> 46:13.938
- Damn it.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

46:13.939 --> 46:15.440
Dear God, Jakob, not now.

46:15.441 --> 46:16.067
Patience.

46:16.068 --> 46:17.450
No, no, no. I have to
deliver this by Monday

46:17.451 --> 46:18.537
or I don't get paid.

46:18.538 --> 46:19.846
I'll fix it.

46:19.847 --> 46:21.729
Your induced voltage is too high.

46:21.730 --> 46:22.911
Thank you, nephew.

46:22.912 --> 46:25.498
That is obvious.

46:25.499 --> 46:28.817
Energy equals magnetic field
times length of conductor.

46:28.818 --> 46:30.573
Times velocity of conductor.

46:30.574 --> 46:32.586
I don't need a physics lesson.

46:32.587 --> 46:36.156
I need to get the damn rotor
spinning at the correct speed.

46:36.157 --> 46:38.264
So why not shorten the
length of the conductor

46:38.265 --> 46:40.402
instead of trying to change
the speed of the rotor?

46:40.403 --> 46:42.702
How the hell do we do that?

46:42.703 --> 46:46.091
Wire cutters.

47:11.278 --> 47:13.613
Try it now.

47:36.533 --> 47:39.029
I think the patient will survive.

47:42.441 --> 47:44.052
You should have seen him, Pauline!

47:44.053 --> 47:45.425
He's here for one week...

47:45.426 --> 47:47.978
one week... and he
fixes all our problems.

47:49.321 --> 47:50.501
We should have school vacations

47:50.502 --> 47:52.034
more often.

47:52.035 --> 47:53.311
Albert. Albert.

47:53.312 --> 47:55.520
I'm very proud of you.

47:56.409 --> 48:00.176
Thank you, Father.

48:00.177 --> 48:01.517
How is Marie, darling?

48:01.518 --> 48:02.635
Wonderful.

48:02.636 --> 48:03.752
She sends her regards.

48:03.753 --> 48:04.869
She's teaching me French.

48:04.870 --> 48:07.040
I bet she's teaching you more than that.

48:07.041 --> 48:08.094
Maja, please.

48:08.095 --> 48:10.967
I've been corresponding with her mother.

48:10.968 --> 48:12.851
Everyone is quite excited.

48:12.852 --> 48:15.342
- Excited? About what?
- The courtship, of course.

48:15.343 --> 48:16.715
The potential of it.

48:16.716 --> 48:18.247
Albert, your Uncle Jakob

48:18.248 --> 48:20.428
was mentioning how we could
use another gifted engineer

48:20.429 --> 48:22.358
- in our company.
- I've been saying that for years.

48:22.359 --> 48:24.499
I'm sure Marie would love Milan.

48:24.500 --> 48:25.777
The food,

48:25.778 --> 48:27.308
the fashion. We could even help them

48:27.309 --> 48:28.618
rent a nice apartment,

48:28.619 --> 48:29.639
couldn't we, Hermann?

48:29.640 --> 48:30.916
Mother, I appreciate

48:30.917 --> 48:33.246
your interest, and I adore Marie,

48:33.247 --> 48:34.971
but I'm not ready for marriage,

48:34.972 --> 48:36.731
and I don't plan on moving to Milan.

48:36.732 --> 48:38.566
Not immediately, of course. I
mean, obviously you would have

48:38.567 --> 48:39.899
to finish your
engineering studies first.

48:39.900 --> 48:41.184
I'm sorry, Father,

48:41.185 --> 48:42.397
but I-I have no intention

48:42.398 --> 48:43.580
of becoming an engineer.

48:43.581 --> 48:45.373
Well...

48:46.008 --> 48:47.711
Such an aptitude for it.

48:47.712 --> 48:49.594
Maybe, but I can't bear the thought

48:49.595 --> 48:52.484
of having to spend my creative energy

48:52.485 --> 48:54.175
making practical, everyday life

48:54.176 --> 48:57.591
more refined for-for the
sole purpose of capital gain.

48:57.592 --> 48:59.507
- It's...
- Dear God. What in God's name

48:59.508 --> 49:00.690
have they been teaching you

49:00.691 --> 49:01.775
in Switzerland?

49:01.776 --> 49:03.276
You sound like a communist.

49:03.277 --> 49:05.158
I'm not a communist,
I'm an Internationalist.

49:05.159 --> 49:07.114
Inter... What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

49:07.115 --> 49:07.734
I wouldn't expect you

49:07.735 --> 49:09.043
- to understand.
- Really? Oh, why?

49:09.044 --> 49:11.244
Because I'm not as
brilliant as you, I suppose?

49:11.245 --> 49:12.362
Hermann, please don't.

49:12.363 --> 49:13.768
- May I be excused?
- No.

49:13.769 --> 49:15.748
Tell me, my son, the genius.

49:15.749 --> 49:17.631
Yeah, how do you
propose to make a living

49:17.632 --> 49:19.196
- without a job?
- I've told you before.

49:19.197 --> 49:20.472
I'm going to be a professor.

49:20.473 --> 49:21.623
I will think

49:21.624 --> 49:22.676
for thinking's sake.

49:22.677 --> 49:23.890
That is the most indulgent thing

49:23.891 --> 49:24.774
I've ever heard.

49:24.775 --> 49:26.243
I'm sure from your bourgeois perspective

49:26.244 --> 49:27.520
it would seem indulgent.

49:27.521 --> 49:28.732
What? My bourgeois per...

49:28.733 --> 49:30.073
But I'm going to Zurich Polytechnic.

49:30.074 --> 49:31.446
Y-You failed

49:31.447 --> 49:33.586
- your entrance exam.
- I won't fail again.

49:33.587 --> 49:34.928
- Stop it, both of you.
- Who do you think's

49:34.929 --> 49:36.588
gonna pay for this
Zurich Polytechnic, huh?

49:36.589 --> 49:38.136
The same people who pay for you

49:38.137 --> 49:40.929
to keep plundering your
businesses into the ground.

49:40.930 --> 49:41.950
Mother's family.

49:41.951 --> 49:42.846
- That's who.
- Oh.

49:42.847 --> 49:43.931
Like hell they will.

49:43.932 --> 49:46.133
They've already agreed.

49:46.134 --> 49:47.321
Did you arrange this?

49:48.049 --> 49:49.040
No, no.

49:49.041 --> 49:50.603
It was entirely my doing.

49:50.604 --> 49:51.689
When you left me behind

49:51.690 --> 49:52.838
in Germany,

49:52.839 --> 49:54.658
you told me to be independent,

49:54.659 --> 49:56.543
to take responsibility for myself.

49:56.544 --> 49:58.139
At first, I thought
you were being cruel,

49:58.140 --> 50:00.469
but now I see you did
me a great service.

50:00.470 --> 50:01.906
You were right.

50:01.907 --> 50:04.683
My future is mine and mine alone,

50:04.684 --> 50:06.796
so I must take charge of it.

50:07.877 --> 50:09.186
Thank you

50:09.187 --> 50:10.559
for the lovely holiday, Mother.

50:10.560 --> 50:12.443
Maja.

50:12.444 --> 50:14.070
Oh, don't leave

50:14.071 --> 50:15.188
like this, Albert.

51:16.716 --> 51:19.492
Physics, pass.

51:19.493 --> 51:21.184
Mathematics, pass.

51:21.185 --> 51:25.654
Zoology, botany, literature...

51:25.655 --> 51:27.474
pass.

51:27.475 --> 51:30.121
Oh, which brings us to French.

51:30.122 --> 51:32.487
Specifically, your essay.

51:32.488 --> 51:35.680
And, uh, oh, I translate:

51:35.681 --> 51:37.788
"I will enroll in Zurich Polytechnic.

51:37.789 --> 51:39.999
"I will stay there four
years and study physics

51:40.000 --> 51:41.532
"and mathematics.

51:41.533 --> 51:43.735
"I suppose I will become
a teacher in these fields,

51:43.736 --> 51:47.031
focusing on the theoretical parts."

51:48.621 --> 51:51.080
Your vocabulary is elementary,
the syntax simplistic,

51:51.081 --> 51:53.926
you did not use the future simple.

52:00.691 --> 52:02.644
But I think it is an excellent plan.

52:04.140 --> 52:05.836
Welcome to Zurich Polytechnic.

52:07.556 --> 52:09.157
Thank you, sir, thank you.

52:10.333 --> 52:11.705
Good-bye, Albert.

52:11.706 --> 52:13.147
I'm so proud of you.

52:15.506 --> 52:17.778
- Safe travels.
- Albert, come here, son.

52:19.497 --> 52:23.284
Don't let those academic fools
in Zurich change you, Albert.

52:23.285 --> 52:25.689
Their knowledge is their
weakness, while your imagination

52:25.690 --> 52:26.966
is your strength.

52:26.967 --> 52:28.371
Thank you.

52:28.372 --> 52:30.963
- Thank you for everything.
- Oh.

52:33.578 --> 52:35.848
Well...

52:36.993 --> 52:38.404
...have a safe journey.

52:45.039 --> 52:46.251
- Marie, wait!
- Just go, Albert.

52:46.252 --> 52:47.534
Please!

52:50.979 --> 52:53.819
Marie, I'm going to write to you.

52:53.820 --> 52:56.181
And Zurich's not that far.

52:56.182 --> 52:57.683
- I'll visit.
- It's all right.

52:57.684 --> 53:00.173
I am happy for you.

53:00.174 --> 53:03.116
You're going to do great things.

53:04.994 --> 53:07.803
I'll... I'll find a
formula to freeze time,

53:07.804 --> 53:09.112
you won't even know I'm gone.

53:09.113 --> 53:11.257
What a lovely thought.

53:20.991 --> 53:22.906
...true example

53:22.907 --> 53:24.502
of this nation's youth...

53:24.503 --> 53:26.577
selfless, strong, courageous...

53:26.578 --> 53:27.950
then sign up!

53:27.951 --> 53:30.185
We must rise against
the Weimar Republic!

53:30.186 --> 53:32.708
Rise against the conniving,

53:32.709 --> 53:34.463
- corrupt, and conquering Jew!
- Excuse me!

53:34.464 --> 53:35.997
You're disrupting our business.

53:35.998 --> 53:37.432
- Could you...
- We have an agitator!

53:37.433 --> 53:38.998
This is our livelihood!

53:38.999 --> 53:40.530
Get your swine hands off of me!

53:40.531 --> 53:42.828
I said stand back!

53:42.829 --> 53:45.224
- Leave Germany!
- You have no right!

53:47.491 --> 53:48.672
Lousy Jew!

53:48.673 --> 53:50.109
Stay down!

53:50.110 --> 53:51.450
You better get down,

53:51.451 --> 53:53.275
you dirty Jew!

53:54.036 --> 53:56.525
We should stop this.

53:56.526 --> 53:59.112
Kampf! Kampf! Kampf!
Kampf! Kampf! Kampf! Kampf!

53:59.113 --> 53:59.943
Stop!

53:59.944 --> 54:01.795
Kampf! Kampf! Kampf!
Kampf! Kampf! Kampf!

54:01.796 --> 54:04.258
Albert Einstein?

54:05.946 --> 54:08.179
Herr Einstein!

54:08.180 --> 54:10.733
Herr Einstein!

54:10.734 --> 54:12.879
Herr Einstein!

54:16.290 --> 54:17.406
Stop!

54:17.407 --> 54:18.908
May I have...

54:18.909 --> 54:20.765
your autograph, sir?

54:26.092 --> 54:28.007
I'm sorry, young man, I...

54:28.008 --> 54:30.018
seem to have lost my pen.

54:30.019 --> 54:31.935
Bruno! Back here now!

54:31.936 --> 54:35.384
When I grow up, I want to be
a scientist, just like you.

54:35.385 --> 54:36.659
Germany Heil!

54:42.408 --> 54:44.547
Elsa.

54:44.548 --> 54:46.180
Elsa.

54:47.421 --> 54:49.175
You're right.

54:49.176 --> 54:51.384
It's time.

54:52.466 --> 54:54.795
Oh. Um...

54:54.796 --> 54:57.350
um...

54:57.351 --> 54:59.808
I'll, um...

54:59.809 --> 55:01.665
I'll call Princeton.

55:43.373 --> 55:45.288
Oh, I'm sorry.

55:45.289 --> 55:46.186
For what?

55:46.187 --> 55:47.590
I must have the wrong room.

55:47.591 --> 55:49.187
What class are you looking for?

55:49.188 --> 55:51.357
Physics. Good day.

55:51.358 --> 55:54.581
Tell me, do you know Empedocles?

55:54.582 --> 55:55.507
Excuse me?

55:55.508 --> 55:57.455
Empedocles.

55:57.456 --> 56:00.839
The pre-Socratic philosopher
who studied cosmogony.

56:00.840 --> 56:03.235
As I said, I am in... Physics.

56:03.236 --> 56:05.469
Yes, you made that quite clear.

56:05.470 --> 56:09.077
Cosmogony is the study of
the origins of the cosmos.

56:09.078 --> 56:11.791
And Empedocles, he was
the first known person

56:11.792 --> 56:14.504
to ask the simple
question, what is light?

56:14.505 --> 56:16.006
I'm sorry, who are you?

56:16.007 --> 56:18.560
He believed that Aphrodite, a woman...

56:18.561 --> 56:20.091
in case you didn't know...

56:20.092 --> 56:22.646
formed the human eye
and lit a fire in it,

56:22.647 --> 56:24.555
allowing us to see.

56:24.556 --> 56:26.478
Well, that's ridiculous.
If that were the case,

56:26.479 --> 56:29.351
well, then we could see
equally well at night.

56:29.352 --> 56:32.322
Empedocles thought the same,

56:32.323 --> 56:34.653
so he postulated that the
sun's rays may be linked

56:34.654 --> 56:36.726
to the rays shooting from our eyes.

56:36.727 --> 56:39.665
A fanciful idea, I
know, but if not for him,

56:39.666 --> 56:42.538
we might not have had the
counter-theories of Aristotle,

56:42.539 --> 56:44.773
then Euclid, then Alhazen,

56:44.774 --> 56:46.370
Kepler, Newton, Faraday,

56:46.371 --> 56:49.499
and, finally, James Clark Maxwell.

56:49.500 --> 56:51.797
Light is electromagnetic radiation.

56:51.798 --> 56:53.393
I apologize. I didn't think...

56:53.394 --> 56:54.959
That a woman could possibly

56:54.960 --> 56:57.545
understand that the curl of
the electric field is equal

56:57.546 --> 57:00.258
to the negative time derivative
of the magnetic field?

57:00.259 --> 57:02.141
Faraday's Law.

57:02.142 --> 57:03.899
The Maxwell-Faraday equation,

57:03.900 --> 57:05.655
if we are being specific.

57:05.656 --> 57:09.517
You see, Empedocles was
wrong about how we see,

57:09.518 --> 57:11.753
but he stumbled upon a universal truth:

57:11.754 --> 57:13.923
human perception is frightfully narrow.

57:13.924 --> 57:15.967
We believe we see the
whole, when, in fact,

57:15.968 --> 57:18.145
we've only seen a fraction.

57:19.830 --> 57:21.012
Good morning.

57:21.013 --> 57:22.225
Professor Weber.

57:22.226 --> 57:23.407
Herr Einstein.

57:23.408 --> 57:24.843
I see you have met

57:24.844 --> 57:26.854
the only student to have
scored higher than you

57:26.855 --> 57:29.728
in the mathematics section
of our entrance exam.

57:29.729 --> 57:33.246
Say hello to Mileva Maric.

57:48.471 --> 57:50.105
Albert?

57:51.568 --> 57:53.068
It's probably Mileva.

57:53.069 --> 57:55.719
I can't take any more bad news.

57:55.720 --> 57:58.208
You have to talk to her.

58:07.788 --> 58:09.957
Hello, Mileva.

58:09.958 --> 58:12.065
Oh. Uh, uh, apologies. I thought...

58:12.066 --> 58:14.784
No, would you repeat that, please?

58:16.633 --> 58:18.553
It's the United States Embassy.

58:33.172 --> 58:36.433
This way, please.

58:45.143 --> 58:47.122
Dr. and Mrs. Einstein.

58:47.123 --> 58:49.358
Thank you for coming
in on such short notice.

58:49.359 --> 58:51.847
I'm Deputy Consul General Raymond Geist.

58:51.848 --> 58:53.923
It's a real honor to meet you both.

58:53.924 --> 58:55.717
Please have a seat.

58:57.531 --> 59:00.742
I must say, we were quite
surprised by your call.

59:00.743 --> 59:02.815
We've been to the United
States three times now,

59:02.816 --> 59:04.956
and we've never had a
problem obtaining visas.

59:04.957 --> 59:06.519
Yes, ma'am.

59:06.520 --> 59:09.234
You are aware, young man,
that our boat leaves tomorrow.

59:09.235 --> 59:11.310
It's all right, Elsa.

59:11.311 --> 59:13.480
How can we help you, Mr. Geist?

59:13.481 --> 59:17.056
What is the purpose for your
travel to America, Professor?

59:17.057 --> 59:18.653
I'm giving a series of lectures

59:18.654 --> 59:21.303
at the California
Institute of Technology

59:21.304 --> 59:25.229
and opening the Institute for
Advanced Study at Princeton.

59:25.230 --> 59:27.145
But you knew that already.

59:27.146 --> 59:29.125
Is that all you plan on doing?

59:29.126 --> 59:30.593
How do you mean?

59:30.594 --> 59:34.271
What is your political creed, Professor?

59:37.906 --> 59:40.332
Is this a joke, Mr. Geist?

59:40.333 --> 59:42.317
I'm afraid it isn't.

59:45.793 --> 59:48.058
Are you now or have you ever been

59:48.059 --> 59:50.613
a member of any political organization?

59:50.614 --> 59:51.927
That is none of your business.

59:53.168 --> 59:56.519
Then perhaps we can
talk about Mileva Maric,

59:56.520 --> 59:58.653
your ex-wife, yes? Are
you in frequent contact?

59:58.654 --> 59:59.969
What has she to do with this?

59:59.970 --> 01:00:02.523
Well, to our understanding,
her political background is

01:00:02.524 --> 01:00:03.384
quite radical.

01:00:03.385 --> 01:00:04.821
This is nonsense.

01:00:04.822 --> 01:00:06.896
May I remind you, Mr. Geist,

01:00:06.897 --> 01:00:10.472
your country has invited
me, not the other way around.

01:00:10.473 --> 01:00:13.187
Yes, Professor, but
you have a history of...

01:00:13.188 --> 01:00:15.964
how shall I put this... controversy,

01:00:15.965 --> 01:00:17.641
which calls into
question your loyalties...

01:00:17.642 --> 01:00:18.294
My loyalties?

01:00:18.295 --> 01:00:19.924
And it is my job to ensure

01:00:19.925 --> 01:00:21.838
that any individual coming to our shores

01:00:21.839 --> 01:00:23.117
does not pose a threat.

01:00:23.118 --> 01:00:24.392
If you wish to talk about threats,

01:00:24.393 --> 01:00:26.053
Mr. Geist, perhaps you should

01:00:26.054 --> 01:00:27.586
take a look outside your window.

01:00:27.587 --> 01:00:30.779
Have you noticed the charming
fellows in brown shirts

01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:33.876
who call me Jewish swine

01:00:33.877 --> 01:00:36.472
and want people like me dead?

01:00:36.473 --> 01:00:39.463
If you are referring to the
National Socialist Party,

01:00:39.464 --> 01:00:41.379
they are not in power.

01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:42.943
Oh, no? You want to take a walk with me?

01:00:42.944 --> 01:00:44.630
Professor, I have not
called you here today

01:00:44.631 --> 01:00:47.056
for a-a lesson in German politics.

01:00:47.057 --> 01:00:48.716
I'm not giving you one. Because I doubt

01:00:48.717 --> 01:00:50.952
you'd be smart enough to be in my class.

01:00:50.953 --> 01:00:51.852
Albert.

01:00:53.315 --> 01:00:56.219
Dr. Einstein, I am
conducting this inquiry

01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:57.496
at the request of the director

01:00:57.497 --> 01:01:00.371
of the United States
Bureau of Investigation.

01:01:00.372 --> 01:01:02.286
Hoover?

01:01:02.287 --> 01:01:03.500
Yes.

01:01:03.501 --> 01:01:05.415
Mr. J. Edgar Hoover.

01:01:05.416 --> 01:01:07.618
What does he want with me?

01:01:07.619 --> 01:01:10.109
He's been quite interested
in your political activities

01:01:10.110 --> 01:01:13.021
and affiliations since your
first visit to New York.

01:01:14.164 --> 01:01:16.717
So, unless you answer my questions

01:01:16.718 --> 01:01:18.633
to his satisfaction,

01:01:18.634 --> 01:01:22.310
you will not be granted entry
to the United States of America.
