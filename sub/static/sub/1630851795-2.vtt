[jeremy schwartz]
<i>  this time on moonshiners...</i>

00:08.609 --> 00:10.809
[mike] we up on a mountain
up here, ain't we, brother?

00:10.811 --> 00:12.444
The heat's been on me
and j for a while,

00:12.446 --> 00:14.513
<i>  we just crossed over</i>
<i>  into north carolina.</i>

00:14.515 --> 00:16.382
We've got to
build something new.

00:16.384 --> 00:18.784
I'm gonna solder it
from the inside.

00:18.786 --> 00:20.519
Whoa!

00:20.521 --> 00:21.787
[groaning] oh, god!

00:21.789 --> 00:23.355
Here, you wanna do what
I'm doing? For a while there,

00:23.357 --> 00:25.090
it reminds you of being
a teenager again.

00:26.060 --> 00:29.928
The recipe that jb wants
is all corn, no sugar.

00:29.930 --> 00:32.631
Damn, you ain't never had
a whooping for holding
your breath, have you?

00:32.633 --> 00:34.366
Glad I'm driving you
out of here.

00:34.368 --> 00:38.404
That's the biggest damn
green strawberry
I ever seen in my life, josh.

00:38.406 --> 00:40.773
This is only going to make
one still full of mash.

00:40.775 --> 00:44.343
<i>  So what we're going to do</i>
<i>  is go back down to one</i>
<i>  of our old still sites</i>

00:44.345 --> 00:46.145
and we're gonna run it there.

00:46.147 --> 00:47.212
Somebody's coming
across the bridge.

00:47.214 --> 00:48.547
[man yelling]

00:50.951 --> 00:53.786
<i> [man] this is how</i>
<i>  we make the moonshine!</i>

00:56.490 --> 00:59.158
[country music playing]

00:59.160 --> 01:01.560
-[mark] oh, my god.
-[digger]
would you look at that.

01:01.562 --> 01:05.531
This is where you
and popcorn sutton
made his last run.

01:05.533 --> 01:08.967
I never thought
we'd be up here thinking
about making a run of liquor.

01:10.204 --> 01:12.471
<i> [jeremy] in haywood county,</i>
<i>  north carolina,</i>

01:12.473 --> 01:15.407
<i>  jb is leading</i>
<i>  mark and digger to the site</i>

01:15.409 --> 01:20.646
<i> where their friend and mentor,</i>
<i>  popcorn sutton,</i>
<i>  made his infamous last run.</i>

01:20.648 --> 01:22.815
Tennessee's home to us.
If we're gonna run liquor,

01:22.817 --> 01:24.383
I'd rather run it
in my back door.

01:24.385 --> 01:26.385
<i>  But right now,</i>
<i>  that's not an option,</i>

01:26.387 --> 01:30.022
because the police
are back out in full force.

01:30.024 --> 01:32.591
They are on their a-game
right now.

01:32.593 --> 01:34.193
20 years.

01:34.195 --> 01:36.228
It's been 20 years
right now, come July.

01:36.230 --> 01:38.430
-Yeah, that's what we are,
it'll be 20 years.
-Yeah.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.933
Jb, this is sacred ground.

01:40.935 --> 01:42.067
You're damn right it is.

01:43.070 --> 01:45.771
If there's a holy grail
of moonshine,

01:45.773 --> 01:47.039
it's right here.

01:47.041 --> 01:48.207
Wow.

01:48.275 --> 01:51.577
[digger]
<i>  this is where the rage</i>
<i>  of moonshine began.</i>

01:51.579 --> 01:54.680
This is where popcorn sutton
did his video

01:54.682 --> 01:55.714
<i>  the last run.</i>

01:56.784 --> 01:58.550
What little liquor
comes off of this,

01:58.552 --> 02:00.519
the right people will
pay you $100 a gallon for it.

02:00.521 --> 02:03.889
Popcorn,
he was the outlaw moonshiner.

02:03.891 --> 02:08.627
I'm just doing this so
people can see how rough
an old moonshiner's life was.

02:08.629 --> 02:11.797
He kept telling me,
"wish we could do a video

02:11.799 --> 02:13.866
the way my granddaddy
and daddy had done it."

02:13.868 --> 02:16.902
<i>  he said, "we're gonna keep</i>
<i>  the moonshine tradition</i>
<i>  going."</i>

02:16.904 --> 02:19.404
this is the last damn run
of liquor I'm gonna ever make.

02:19.406 --> 02:21.039
I guess I'm letting you off.

02:21.041 --> 02:23.542
They'll be glad of that 'cause
they won't have to watch me
no damn more.

02:23.544 --> 02:25.811
<i> [jb] he done it out</i>
<i>  in the open too much.</i>

02:25.813 --> 02:29.248
That's the reason
he got caught,
'cause he got too bold.

02:29.250 --> 02:32.050
If I hadn't quit when I did,
I'd have went to the pen.

02:32.052 --> 02:34.520
Cold chills runnin'
over my arm.
I swear, it's just...

02:34.522 --> 02:37.322
Yeah, you're darn right.
His spirit's here.

02:37.324 --> 02:39.591
[jb] oh, yeah,
so something will go wrong.

02:39.593 --> 02:42.361
That's exactly
what was going through
my mind.

02:42.363 --> 02:44.062
[mark]
look, here, the old furnace.

02:44.064 --> 02:47.399
Yeah, we cooked on this.
Pot of beans
and fried potatoes.

02:47.401 --> 02:48.467
Fried potato.

02:48.469 --> 02:50.903
Boys, we ain't gonna
disturb none of this stuff.

02:50.905 --> 02:52.371
No. Hell, no.

02:52.373 --> 02:55.941
That'd be like jumping on
the statue of liberty
and cutting her ear off.

02:55.943 --> 02:57.342
[mark]
well, that's a fine stream.

02:57.344 --> 02:58.810
[jb] yeah, it's good water.

02:58.812 --> 03:01.313
Is this far enough
back from the law?

03:01.315 --> 03:02.648
I think it ought to do it.

03:02.650 --> 03:04.983
If this ain't far enough
out of the dadgum way,

03:04.985 --> 03:07.219
-we deserve to be caught.
-Caught. Yeah, right.

03:07.221 --> 03:08.420
[laughs]

03:08.422 --> 03:11.123
with the fact
that law enforcement's
on our trail,

03:11.125 --> 03:13.926
<i>  we need to exercise</i>
<i>  all caution.</i>

03:13.928 --> 03:16.929
And, right now, we're just
gonna hang out over here
in north carolina a while.

03:16.931 --> 03:18.664
-I'll tell you what, rader.
-Yeah.

03:18.666 --> 03:20.699
Seeing how
you drug us in here,

03:20.701 --> 03:22.968
this first run,
it's gonna be yours.

03:22.970 --> 03:24.803
You tell us how you want it,

03:24.805 --> 03:26.838
-we'll do whatever
you dictate.
-Okay.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.907
You got anything in mind
you want to do?

03:28.909 --> 03:31.276
Well, popcorn always said
something about

03:31.278 --> 03:33.478
making some
pure corn, no sugar,

03:33.480 --> 03:35.514
but he ain't never did do it.

03:35.516 --> 03:38.917
Jb tells us that
popcorn always promised him

03:38.919 --> 03:43.155
that they would do
an all-grain corn run,
no sugar.

03:43.157 --> 03:44.890
I want just pure corn choice,

03:44.892 --> 03:47.426
he always said
it was damn good,

03:47.428 --> 03:49.161
but didn't produce much.

03:49.163 --> 03:50.429
-[digger]
don't make a lot of it.
-No.

03:50.431 --> 03:52.764
[mark] it'll get you about
a half the run of
what sugar would.

03:52.766 --> 03:55.934
Yeah, yeah.
Pure corn, about 103 proof.

03:55.936 --> 03:58.904
You know, we always knew
popcorn wanted to make
an all-grain run.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.472
<i>  He always talked about it.</i>

04:00.474 --> 04:03.542
But the thing that it is,
popcorn didn't have
the patience.

04:03.544 --> 04:06.211
Let's get down here
and get us
a plan ciphered out.

04:06.213 --> 04:08.247
Yeah. We gotta round us up
some materials.

04:08.249 --> 04:10.682
<i>  47 miles to get back out</i>
<i>  and get something.</i>

04:10.684 --> 04:13.318
[dramatic music playing]

04:17.558 --> 04:20.192
[country music playing]

04:23.063 --> 04:25.497
well, jerry, it looks like
we've made it over
the mountain, buddy.

04:25.499 --> 04:27.933
Look at these valleys.
Look at these mountains
on both sides.

04:27.935 --> 04:30.435
Yeah, bud, it's beautiful
out here.

04:30.437 --> 04:33.138
[jeremy]
<i>  on the north carolina-</i>
<i>  tennessee border</i>

04:33.140 --> 04:37.376
<i>  after a police raid</i>
<i>  cleaned out a season's cache</i>
<i>  of moonshine,</i>

04:37.378 --> 04:40.545
<i>  mike and jerry are slipping</i>
<i>  across the state line</i>

04:40.547 --> 04:43.348
<i>  where they can operate</i>
<i>  as relative unknowns.</i>

04:43.350 --> 04:45.384
The heat's been on me
and j for a while,

04:45.386 --> 04:47.753
<i>  so we just crossed over</i>
<i>  into north carolina.</i>

04:47.755 --> 04:50.489
We need to be in a place
we know we'll be safe

04:50.491 --> 04:53.859
and can evade the law
or any other human coming in
and finding us.

04:53.861 --> 04:57.229
So, where in the hell are we
going to look for a still
site out around here, buddy?

04:57.231 --> 04:59.298
There should be a road
that turns off to the left.

04:59.300 --> 05:01.133
You know, I mean,
some people would feel like

05:01.135 --> 05:04.936
they're invading on somebody
else's territory, but to me,
it's neutral ground.

05:04.938 --> 05:06.638
<i>  You know, we got to do</i>
<i>  what we got to do.</i>

05:06.640 --> 05:09.241
If there's anybody else
over here that thinks we're
stepping on their toes,

05:09.243 --> 05:11.143
we'll deal with it
when it comes to us.

05:11.145 --> 05:12.444
Well, this is nice,
ain't it, jerry?

05:12.446 --> 05:14.146
Sure is.

05:14.148 --> 05:16.515
You know, we've been running
in tennessee for
the last two seasons.

05:16.517 --> 05:18.583
You know, I think it's time,
with the heat we got going on,

05:18.585 --> 05:21.687
we've got to figure out
something, and we got to
do it pretty quick.

05:21.689 --> 05:23.355
What's that over yonder?

05:23.357 --> 05:25.090
That's a damn flag over there.

05:25.092 --> 05:26.892
That means somebody
put that there.

05:26.894 --> 05:28.293
Somebody's been in here
clearing this out

05:28.295 --> 05:29.428
-for some reason.
-It's a no-go.

05:29.430 --> 05:31.063
That's just something
we can't have.

05:31.065 --> 05:32.264
[jerry]
don't look too old, either.

05:32.266 --> 05:34.032
No, it does not.

05:34.034 --> 05:36.401
I'm not gonna put
our operation here.

05:36.403 --> 05:39.538
Ain't happening.
We got to bust this place,
we got to move on.

05:39.540 --> 05:42.307
You know, this area that
we're in right now, you know,
I know it really good.

05:42.309 --> 05:43.342
It's not where I grew up,

05:43.344 --> 05:44.576
<i>  but it's dang close.</i>

05:44.578 --> 05:47.245
<i>  It's a great little valley</i>
<i>  to hide in, lots of woods.</i>

05:47.247 --> 05:49.514
This is not my domain.

05:49.516 --> 05:52.417
<i>  Over in tennessee,</i>
<i>  people know exactly</i>
<i>  who me and jerry is.</i>

05:52.419 --> 05:55.087
<i>  You know,</i>
<i>  here in north carolina,</i>
<i>  we're just two regular guys.</i>

05:55.089 --> 05:57.522
<i>  It makes me feel</i>
<i>  a little more comfortable,</i>
<i>  a little more hid.</i>

05:57.524 --> 05:59.124
It's kind of under the radar.

05:59.126 --> 06:01.727
Nice, some good-looking water
right down through here
coming out.

06:01.729 --> 06:04.229
This is where the infamous
popcorn sutton's from.

06:04.231 --> 06:07.032
<i>  He made a lot of liquor</i>
<i>  over here, and he's got</i>
<i>  a big name over here,</i>

06:07.034 --> 06:08.133
<i>  and I respect that.</i>

06:08.135 --> 06:09.701
But it's mine
and jerry's turn now.

06:10.771 --> 06:13.238
We up on a mountain up here,
ain't we, brother?

06:13.240 --> 06:15.040
This is a pretty place.
I guarantee.

06:18.178 --> 06:19.511
[mike]
<i>  I'll tell you what, man.</i>

06:19.546 --> 06:22.247
Me and jerry, we are struck
by the sheer beauty
of this place.

06:22.249 --> 06:24.116
That's some big old timber in
here, ain't there, buddy?

06:24.118 --> 06:26.284
[jerry] sure is.
Away from civilization.

06:26.286 --> 06:27.986
You know, the harder it is
for me and jerry

06:27.988 --> 06:30.255
to get to where we're
gonna go to our still site,

06:30.257 --> 06:33.558
the damn harder it is
for anybody else,
and especially the police.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.527
Man, look at the waterfall
in there.

06:36.530 --> 06:38.663
I say that right there
won't never dry up, will it?

06:38.665 --> 06:40.565
That ought to give us
all the water we need.

06:40.567 --> 06:41.800
[mike] think we can get
down there.

06:41.802 --> 06:43.568
I don't know about getting
back up through here.

06:43.570 --> 06:46.204
We got to get down to
the creek and taste the water.

06:46.206 --> 06:49.174
<i>  I know it's fine water,</i>
<i>  but I always like</i>
<i>  to put my mouth on it.</i>

06:50.878 --> 06:51.943
You're tasting it wrong.

06:51.945 --> 06:53.211
You got to get
your face in it.

06:53.213 --> 06:54.913
[mike] you're gonna put
your mouth on it, ain't ya?

06:54.915 --> 06:56.281
There you go.

06:56.283 --> 06:57.816
Is that not good water
or what?

06:57.818 --> 07:00.051
It's done that it's cold,
clean as it can be.

07:00.053 --> 07:01.620
<i> [jerry] you know, this</i>
<i>  water source right here,</i>

07:01.622 --> 07:03.188
<i>  coming down</i>
<i>  the side of this mountain,</i>

07:03.190 --> 07:06.591
we shouldn't have no problem
having water all season
long and plenty of it.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.393
What do you think about
this little spot
right in here?

07:08.395 --> 07:10.462
I like being able to
see the water.

07:10.464 --> 07:13.498
Yeah. Well, the closer we are
to the water, the better off
we gonna be, ain't we?

07:13.500 --> 07:14.533
Yeah.

07:14.535 --> 07:15.967
You know, I don't
want to haul that rig

07:15.969 --> 07:17.469
and everything across
the mountain over here.

07:17.471 --> 07:18.970
You take a chance
on getting caught with it.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.071
So we got to do something.

07:20.073 --> 07:22.641
I don't want to get caught
crossing down state lines

07:22.643 --> 07:24.843
with something illegal
in the back of my truck.

07:24.845 --> 07:26.545
<i>  That's a federal offense,</i>
<i>  then.</i>

07:26.547 --> 07:28.814
So we've got to build
something new.

07:28.816 --> 07:30.849
Well, what's your thoughts
on what we're gonna
run this year?

07:30.851 --> 07:32.250
I ain't got no damn clue,
really.

07:32.252 --> 07:34.386
From what I've been hearing
through the grapevine,

07:34.388 --> 07:36.621
you know, people's getting
some money back
in their pocket now,

07:36.623 --> 07:39.357
they're buying
high-end alcohol.
A lot of barrel-aged,

07:39.359 --> 07:42.194
good, high-end whiskeys
and stuff is what
they're buying.

07:42.196 --> 07:46.164
Everybody that I've talked
to are wanting high-end,
barrel-aged whiskey.

07:46.166 --> 07:47.632
And they don't mind
paying for it.

07:47.634 --> 07:50.202
And that stuff takes time.
That's something
we don't have, a lot of time.

07:50.204 --> 07:52.337
We definitely don't have time
to start filling up barrels

07:52.339 --> 07:54.639
'cause we've got to start
making money 'cause
we have none.

07:57.578 --> 07:59.444
What if we had
the best of both worlds?

07:59.446 --> 08:02.614
What if we actually ran
our liquor in a wooden barrel?

08:03.584 --> 08:05.350
Run liquor out of
a wooden barrel?

08:05.352 --> 08:07.118
-Yeah.
-A charred white oak barrel.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.286
Yeah.

08:08.288 --> 08:09.788
And how in the hell
are we gonna do that?
It's wood.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.490
We're gonna just put
a core through it.

08:11.492 --> 08:12.958
Still don't get hot.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.494
It'll get hot, but--
all we're doing
is heating the steam.

08:15.496 --> 08:16.595
We can mash right
in the barrel.

08:16.597 --> 08:18.230
I'll just have
to draw it out and show you.

08:18.232 --> 08:21.433
I just come up with an idea
I just don't think
nobody's ever tried.

08:21.435 --> 08:24.603
I mean, who's going to try
to make a moonshine still
out of a wooden barrel?

08:24.605 --> 08:26.071
Let's see what we got here.

08:26.073 --> 08:27.572
-Here's our barrel, right?
-Right.

08:27.574 --> 08:30.375
We come in here,
we cut us in a copper core

08:30.377 --> 08:33.645
and we'll put heat to it
and all that heat
will come up this flute.

08:33.647 --> 08:37.349
We're gonna try to put
that barrel-aged aroma
and taste into it

08:37.351 --> 08:39.417
in the beginning
while we're doing our mash.

08:39.419 --> 08:40.552
What we'll do is we'll stop us

08:40.554 --> 08:42.654
-a couple of
pieces of pipe on top...
-Mmm-hmm.

08:42.656 --> 08:44.890
...So the core itself
becomes part of the flue.

08:44.892 --> 08:46.791
-Wood soaking all
that mash in.
-Mmm-hmm.

08:46.793 --> 08:48.360
<i>  And then as we run it off,</i>

08:48.362 --> 08:50.529
we're gonna have
something that's going to be
essentially a charred taste,

08:50.531 --> 08:52.230
but it's gonna be clear.

08:52.232 --> 08:54.232
I think it's gonna give us
a flavor like none other
when this thing heats up.

08:54.234 --> 08:55.500
Oh, it definitely will.

08:55.502 --> 08:58.136
Usually, to get
that wood charred flavor,
you've got to let,

08:58.138 --> 09:01.106
you know, your alcohol sit
for two to four years.

09:01.108 --> 09:02.841
That should give us
the best of both worlds.

09:02.843 --> 09:07.145
But our goal is to make it
unaged aged alcohol.

09:07.147 --> 09:09.080
I'm ready to rock and roll
with it, brother.

09:10.517 --> 09:12.450

09:21.562 --> 09:22.794

09:22.796 --> 09:24.162
[josh] hell yeah.

09:24.164 --> 09:26.331
-How's it going, boss man?
-What's up, josh?

09:26.333 --> 09:27.332
How is everybody?

09:27.334 --> 09:28.700
Good to see you guys.

09:28.702 --> 09:32.370
<i> [jeremy] arriving</i>
<i>  in franklin county</i>

<i>  to his shine partners,</i>

09:37.044 --> 09:41.413

<i>  their season with a run</i>
<i>  of strawberry brandy.</i>

09:41.415 --> 09:43.381
Boys, I've been through hell.

09:43.383 --> 09:45.317
-Yeah?
-What do you mean hell?

09:45.319 --> 09:49.387
Well, I joshed it up again.

09:49.389 --> 09:53.625
Actually, the biggest damn
green strawberry I ever seen
in my life, josh.

09:53.627 --> 09:55.594
Go back to the truck.
I'm expecting strawberries.

09:55.596 --> 09:58.029
And lo and behold,
what we got, watermelons.

09:58.031 --> 10:00.098
And then
I look a little closer
and there's pineapple.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.334
Dang, josh.
You look like you done
skinned a gator!

10:02.336 --> 10:03.501
Lord almighty!

10:04.972 --> 10:07.572
Make me up a gator skin
boot right there.

10:07.574 --> 10:08.840
Yes, sir.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.809
I really truthfully think

10:10.811 --> 10:13.144
that that would make
some good moonshine
right there.

10:13.146 --> 10:15.113
Maybe if the cores
were out of it.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.215
-[scoffs] I don't know
about that [bleep].
-They're awful dry.

10:17.217 --> 10:18.583
They're about rotten.

10:18.585 --> 10:20.952
Yeah, we tried a lot
of things over the years,

10:20.954 --> 10:24.456
but alligator skin pineapple,
that's just not on our list.

10:24.458 --> 10:26.091
What you got in mind, josh?

10:26.093 --> 10:28.259
There's a family recipe
from back home

10:28.261 --> 10:30.228
that's super famous
called the green lizard.

10:30.230 --> 10:32.931
We make it out of
the watermelon, the rind,
everything.

10:32.933 --> 10:34.432
Just smash it all up.

10:34.434 --> 10:37.535
It really brings out
that watermelon flavor
if you'd use the rinds.

10:37.537 --> 10:41.606
I remember seeing the adults
drinking green lizard
when I was a kid, you know?

10:41.608 --> 10:45.744
And my dad passed
this recipe down, and that's
how I found out about it.

10:45.746 --> 10:48.279
We're not gonna use any sugar.
When we run it,

10:48.281 --> 10:52.384
we run it twice,
double distill it,
and it comes out so good.

10:52.386 --> 10:55.186
This is only enough
for maybe one pot.

10:55.188 --> 10:57.222
I don't know
how much this is going
to wind up being.

10:57.224 --> 11:00.425
You know, we've built
this great big still site.
There's eight pots.

11:00.427 --> 11:03.428
<i>  This looks like</i>
<i>  a lot of watermelons.</i>

11:03.430 --> 11:05.964
That right there,
that's gonna mash
in one pot.

11:05.966 --> 11:09.000
Look, man, this may
not be enough to mash in
all these stills,

11:09.002 --> 11:11.269
but I think it'll bring
good money. It's going
to be good liquor.

11:11.271 --> 11:13.238
-Ready to roll with it.
-I'm for it.
What do you think?

11:13.240 --> 11:15.440
-Sounds good to me.
-We got it,
let's roll with it.

11:15.442 --> 11:17.842
Now, how are you going
to plan on busting
all this stuff up?

11:17.844 --> 11:20.779
-I got a smasher over there.
-Let's go check it out.

11:20.781 --> 11:25.450
Josh is telling us that
he's got a special purpose
for these watermelons.

11:25.452 --> 11:28.620
<i>  We're gonna make</i>
<i>  a little higher-end liquor</i>
<i>  this year</i>

11:28.622 --> 11:30.522
than what we made during
the pandemic.

11:30.524 --> 11:32.524
<i>  Now, that everybody</i>
<i>  is coming out of it,</i>

11:32.526 --> 11:36.027
it's gonna be like
the roaring '20s
all over again.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.296
<i>  People are gonna be out,</i>
<i>  they're gonna be</i>
<i>  wanting to drink.</i>

11:38.298 --> 11:40.398
They're gonna
want to be celebrating.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.634
We're gonna make sure
they celebrate with
our moonshine.

11:42.636 --> 11:46.004
Basically,
this fits pretty tight
in there, okay?

11:46.973 --> 11:50.141
And then
this goes on here, okay?

11:50.143 --> 11:51.476
What do you mean?
Which way?

11:51.478 --> 11:53.378
It'll go up here,
like this right here

11:53.380 --> 11:55.980
and then attach to this,
okay?

11:55.982 --> 11:59.484
And then that pushes it down
and smash everything.

11:59.486 --> 12:01.319
Josh has got this thing.

12:01.321 --> 12:04.656
<i>  It's basically the biggest</i>
<i> beer can crusher in the world.</i>

12:04.658 --> 12:09.060
He says we're gonna be able
to smash these watermelons
up with that.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.428
Let's see what she'll do.

12:10.430 --> 12:13.765
I ain't no rocket scientist,
but a hammer does
the same thing.

12:13.767 --> 12:14.799
[josh] there we go.

12:16.303 --> 12:18.570
-No.
-Lift up on it
and jerk it down.

12:18.572 --> 12:19.938
Yeah, bring it up
and jerk.

12:19.940 --> 12:23.541
We're having a slight problem
with this fruit crusher.

12:23.543 --> 12:27.545
It's a little bit tougher
to get the rind busted down.

12:27.547 --> 12:29.380
-Is it smashing 'em?
-Yeah, it's smashing 'em.

12:29.382 --> 12:30.749
Smash. Keep on getting it.

12:32.586 --> 12:33.651
[josh] that ain't gonna work.

12:37.557 --> 12:39.791
[country music playing]

12:39.793 --> 12:42.127
damn, I thought
that was gonna do it.

12:42.129 --> 12:45.463
It got a good start on it,
but that's about it.

12:45.465 --> 12:48.600
Well, I don't like
how much work it is.

12:48.602 --> 12:50.502
We've got these watermelons
in this masher.

12:50.504 --> 12:52.270
<i>  We can't get</i>
<i>  enough leverage on it.</i>

12:52.272 --> 12:54.372
It just...
It's not going to do it.

12:54.374 --> 12:57.275
What if we put
a hydraulic ram on it?

12:57.277 --> 12:59.778
You know, just hook it to
a battery and use a little...

12:59.780 --> 13:01.412
Button up and down,
up and down?

13:01.414 --> 13:03.782
I got a hydraulic arm
back here.

13:03.784 --> 13:05.316
Kind of a ditch witch.

13:05.318 --> 13:07.952
[henry] show me
what you talking about.
I have to see what you mean.

13:07.954 --> 13:10.155
Let's see.
Where's that bastard at?

13:10.157 --> 13:11.856
Back over yonder
beside that table.

13:11.858 --> 13:13.391
I call it the ol' boneyard.

13:14.995 --> 13:17.295
[josh] right here's
the hydraulic ram.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.264
[henry]
oh, no, no, no, no, no.

13:19.266 --> 13:21.065
That's my damn
wood splitter, hoss.

13:21.067 --> 13:23.401
-I think we can make
it work though.
-Check it out.

13:23.403 --> 13:25.036
Y'all can't tear out
my wood splitter.

13:25.038 --> 13:26.704
-It's got our handle.
-Yeah.

13:26.706 --> 13:28.640
All we got to do
is unbolt it right here.

13:28.642 --> 13:29.974
It's not even mine.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.075
Whose is it?

13:31.077 --> 13:32.544
It's been sitting here
for five years.

13:33.647 --> 13:35.647
[tickle] damn sounds like
it's his now.

13:35.649 --> 13:38.349
Well, I can't watch this.
I can't watch it.
Go on, take it apart.

13:38.351 --> 13:39.984
-For real?
-Yeah, for real.
Take it apart.

13:39.986 --> 13:42.554
Henry, he's got
an old log splitter

13:42.556 --> 13:45.690
and this suits
our purposes perfectly.

13:45.692 --> 13:49.394
This thing's probably got
about a 20-ton cylinder on it,

13:49.396 --> 13:51.930
and it's made to hook up
to a tractor.

13:51.932 --> 13:56.701
And so what we'll do is
we're gonna make
this fruit smasher hydraulic.

13:57.771 --> 14:00.138
We're gonna take it
and mount this up in a frame,

14:00.140 --> 14:04.008
change that plate out
to what we got on our smasher
and put it right here.

14:04.010 --> 14:08.513
Hook this to henry's tractor
and smash fruit

14:08.515 --> 14:10.248
and let back up off of it.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.083
[henry] so be gentle.
Be gentle.

14:12.085 --> 14:14.786
This is where we're going
to put our fruit in.

14:14.788 --> 14:20.058
We're going to come up
and build a frame up here,
over and down,

14:20.060 --> 14:24.329
and then we're gonna take
this hydraulic cylinder
and mount it right here.

14:24.331 --> 14:25.930
Perfect.

14:25.932 --> 14:28.633
And then we'll hook it
to henry's tractor,
and when we pull the lever,

14:28.635 --> 14:32.036
it's going to mash down
with about 20 tons of force.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.338
All right. So, let's
fire us some metal

14:33.340 --> 14:34.939
and let's put this baby
together.

the whole thing
on fire welding.

we got to

and get us a flow
of water started.

hose run from?
-Up over there.

17:22.308 --> 17:23.841
Hell yeah, it's cold.

17:23.843 --> 17:27.512
[mark] there's one more thing
I got to do here before
we get started.

17:27.514 --> 17:31.916
I've got something here
that popcorn gave me
before he died.

17:31.918 --> 17:35.019
It's an irreplaceable
piece of history.

17:35.021 --> 17:39.590
People just forgot about it
years ago
and it showed back up.

17:39.592 --> 17:40.725
[digger] I will be damned.

17:42.095 --> 17:43.961
Looky there, boys.

17:43.963 --> 17:46.431
Popcorn gave that to me.
I asked him for it.

17:46.433 --> 17:48.866
Six months
or eight months later,

17:48.868 --> 17:50.301
he showed up at the house.

17:50.303 --> 17:52.503
He said, "I brought
a few of that damn sign,"
and he doesn't want 'em.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.672
He was notorious
for building signs

17:54.674 --> 17:56.374
-and making signs.
-Oh, he loved
making signs.

17:56.376 --> 17:57.909
He couldn't spell for [bleep].

17:57.911 --> 17:59.977
It ain't worth two cents,

17:59.979 --> 18:01.979
but I wouldn't trade it
for a damn rembrandt.

18:01.981 --> 18:06.050
Well, it's time to quit
being reminiscent
and get to work.

18:06.052 --> 18:07.085
Let's get after it.

18:09.522 --> 18:11.956
There's the way I go now,
the dreaded tri-stream.

18:11.958 --> 18:14.392
[laughing]

18:14.394 --> 18:17.228
wake up in the morning,
and you're pissing
in three different directions.

18:19.532 --> 18:22.667
Why don't you do the honors
and light this here burner
and warm this water up.

18:24.938 --> 18:25.870
[digger] oh, yeah.

18:25.872 --> 18:27.205
Yeah, it's lit good.

18:27.207 --> 18:29.574
You want to get that water
kind of rolling a little bit

18:29.576 --> 18:31.542
-before we add that corn.
-Oh, yeah.

18:31.544 --> 18:32.944
-Corn?
-Corn.

18:32.946 --> 18:36.614
The recipe that jb wants
is all corn and no sugar.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.616
[digger]
coarse ground white cornmeal.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.218
<i> [mark] when you do all grains,</i>

18:40.220 --> 18:43.254
you have to use quadruple
the amount of grain

18:43.256 --> 18:45.323
in order to generate
enough starch

18:45.325 --> 18:49.327
and natural sugars
to produce any volume at all.

18:49.329 --> 18:50.761
-That thing is settled down?
-Yeah.

18:50.763 --> 18:52.396
It ain't going down none
too fast,

18:52.398 --> 18:54.565
but it might again when we
get this bucket in there.

18:54.567 --> 18:57.602
Once it starts releasing,
the starches comes
into a clump,

18:57.604 --> 18:58.970
that's when it'll burn.

18:58.972 --> 19:03.341
So when we dump
all that corn in here,
we go flame out.

19:03.343 --> 19:06.110
We've got to keep stirring.
We don't need no lumps.

19:06.112 --> 19:10.314
We let this sit here from
the 210-degree temperature
it's at right now

19:10.316 --> 19:12.950
<i>  till it gets down</i>
<i>  to about 160.</i>

19:12.952 --> 19:16.053
Then we'll put
our magic dust in there
and let it do its work.

19:18.358 --> 19:20.158
Here, you want to do
what I'm doing.
For a while there,

19:20.160 --> 19:22.093
it reminds you of being
a teenager again.

19:22.095 --> 19:23.227
[all laughing]

19:24.631 --> 19:27.498
I tell you, it feels just like
I'm stirring up

19:27.500 --> 19:30.902
a dadgum giant bowl
of cornbread batter.

19:30.904 --> 19:35.473
As we stir and
this corn's swelling back up,
all the sugars are coming out.

19:35.475 --> 19:36.574
Look at it.

19:36.576 --> 19:38.543
<i> [digger] well, they're still</i>
<i>  in long chains.</i>

19:38.545 --> 19:42.046
They just clump up,
and then it becomes
one big large mass,

19:42.048 --> 19:43.915
just like cooking grits
or oatmeal.

19:43.917 --> 19:45.583
[mark] I mean,
I love the way it looks,

19:45.585 --> 19:49.153
but I never thought
I'd ever see any liquor mash
that looks like that.

19:49.155 --> 19:50.955
<i> [digger] if everything goes</i>
<i>  the way it's supposed to,</i>

19:50.957 --> 19:52.523
<i>  that amylase</i>
<i>  will break it down.</i>

19:52.525 --> 19:54.525
When it comes
to making all-grain liquor,

19:54.527 --> 19:57.461
<i>  there's a secret weapon</i>
<i>  that nobody</i>
<i>  can survive without,</i>

19:57.463 --> 19:59.463
<i>  and that's amylase enzyme.</i>

19:59.465 --> 20:01.532
Get that whooped in.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.201
Oh, we'll whoop it.

20:03.203 --> 20:04.435
Hella fun.

20:05.338 --> 20:07.038
It's like mixing cement.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.640
The amylase is
a digestive aid basically.

20:09.642 --> 20:12.410
<i>  It's in insect bellies,</i>
<i>  it's in our bellies.</i>

20:12.412 --> 20:14.212
Well, you can already
see it's working.

20:14.214 --> 20:16.247
In the name of simeon.

20:16.249 --> 20:20.017
This amylase, basically,
it's a meat cleaver
for the sugar chains,

20:20.019 --> 20:22.253
and it just chops
them up into smaller bites

20:22.255 --> 20:25.456
that the yeast can take in
and convert into alcohol.

20:25.458 --> 20:27.892
[mark] look at that, jb.
Look how it's done
loosened up.

20:27.894 --> 20:30.127
It's making those sugars

20:30.129 --> 20:32.263
-more accessible to yeast.
-Yeah, right.

20:32.265 --> 20:34.165
-This is insane.
-All right.

20:34.167 --> 20:35.766
No, it's science.

20:37.237 --> 20:39.070
[mark] this is jb's run.

20:39.072 --> 20:43.107
He come up with this,
and digger has learned
me something here so special,

20:43.109 --> 20:46.410
I volunteered to do all
the bucketing over.

20:46.412 --> 20:48.246
[digger] don't splash that
on your leg.

20:48.248 --> 20:49.313
[jb] no, it'd be hot.

20:49.315 --> 20:51.115
You talk about doing
that thumped keg walk,

20:51.117 --> 20:53.384
you'll be doing
the burnt sack boogie.

20:53.386 --> 20:55.086
"burnt sack boogie."
[laughing]

20:55.989 --> 20:58.289
damn, don't want that.

20:58.291 --> 21:01.525
You couldn't
even hardly shake it off
of the mash stick before.

21:01.527 --> 21:03.461
<i>  And now it just...</i>

21:03.463 --> 21:06.163
It looks like mash
is supposed to look.

21:06.165 --> 21:07.465
Boys, you've done great.

21:07.467 --> 21:09.333
Let's don't jinx ourselves,
guys.

21:09.335 --> 21:11.535
We ain't turned it
into liquor yet.

21:12.572 --> 21:14.138
We gave it
a good healthy dose.

21:14.140 --> 21:16.140
You can't never pitch
too much yeast.

21:16.142 --> 21:18.542
-No.
-Looky here at this, jb.

21:18.544 --> 21:19.844
-Yeah.
-What do you think of that?

21:19.846 --> 21:22.313
Oh, yeah, that's one
good-looking mash.

21:22.315 --> 21:24.782
-Now, we got to
make some liquor.
-Yeah.

21:24.784 --> 21:27.218
-And make it 103.
-103.

21:27.220 --> 21:29.186
That's an honest day's work.

21:29.188 --> 21:31.122
-For half a day's wages.
-Yeah.

21:32.592 --> 21:34.025
[jb] yeah,
I might give you a raise.

21:40.133 --> 21:43.200
[rock music playing]

21:45.371 --> 21:47.238
<i> [josh] we're using</i>
<i>  this watermelon smasher</i>

21:47.240 --> 21:49.206
<i>  and that stuff's</i>
<i>  flying everywhere.</i>

21:49.208 --> 21:52.410
I'm talking about
if you mash down
and hold it down,

21:52.412 --> 21:54.912
and it squirting dang
8-10 feet straight up.

21:54.914 --> 21:58.149
I want to start
squeezing down,
slow down on it.

21:58.151 --> 22:01.152
It works awesome
and it cuts our time down,

22:01.154 --> 22:03.220
<i>  and this thing</i>
<i>  has got a ton of power.</i>

22:03.222 --> 22:05.022
It's badass.

22:05.024 --> 22:08.993
This stuff only got
to be busted up a little bit,
it ain't got to be real fine.

22:08.995 --> 22:10.528
As long as this stuff's
broke up enough

22:10.530 --> 22:13.230
to actually get it in there
and get juice out of it,

22:13.232 --> 22:15.099
that's all we really need.

22:15.101 --> 22:17.201
[henry] this baby here
is almost ready to put in

22:17.203 --> 22:19.170
once I bring the water up
to about right here.

22:19.172 --> 22:20.905
Then we're going
throw the yeast in it, baby.

22:20.907 --> 22:22.506
Gonna make that green lizard,
brother.

22:22.508 --> 22:26.077
<i> [tickle] as we're smashing</i>
<i>  these watermelons,</i>
<i>  I'm noticing that</i>

22:26.079 --> 22:29.914
we might fill four barrels up,
which is enough
for one small pot.

22:29.916 --> 22:33.150
<i>  You know, we built</i>
<i>  this great big still site.</i>
<i>  There's eight pots.</i>

22:33.152 --> 22:35.453
<i>  The watermelon's gonna</i>
<i>  make some good brandy.</i>

22:35.455 --> 22:38.322
It's just not gonna
make enough of it.

22:38.324 --> 22:40.157
What's fixin' to happen here?

22:40.159 --> 22:41.792
[henry]
what we're gonna do here,

22:41.794 --> 22:46.097
we're gonna kick
this yeast off before
we pour it in the tub.

22:46.099 --> 22:48.599
We're taking a little bit
of warm water, we're taking
some of the mash bill.

22:48.601 --> 22:50.468
And you'll see
that baby kick in.

22:50.470 --> 22:54.438
We're not gonna add
any sugar at all
to our liquor.

22:54.440 --> 22:57.174
We want this thing
to be all watermelon.

22:57.176 --> 22:58.476
[henry]
baby is working.

22:58.478 --> 22:59.510
Get them in the barrels.

22:59.512 --> 23:01.245
It's gonna make better liquor.

23:01.247 --> 23:03.381
-Looks good.
-Yes, it does.

23:03.383 --> 23:07.051
<i> [tickle] now that we've got</i>
<i>  everything mashed in</i>
<i>  and getting it working,</i>

23:07.053 --> 23:10.321
it's just a matter of waiting
for this stuff to work off.

23:10.323 --> 23:13.524
When it gets ready,
we're gonna take this stuff
down to the still site

23:13.526 --> 23:15.893
and, hopefully, we come out
with a great product.

23:15.895 --> 23:17.228
Looky yonder.

23:17.230 --> 23:19.163
Henry, this thing
is working like hell.

23:19.165 --> 23:20.798
-Perfect.
-That's what we want
right there.

23:23.035 --> 23:26.170
[dramatic music playing]

23:35.782 --> 23:37.915
bettin' ol' davey's got
what we're looking for?

23:37.917 --> 23:40.050
I'll bet if anybody stands
a chance, he's going
to have it.

23:40.052 --> 23:41.385
<i> [mike] jerry come up with</i>
<i>  a good idea</i>

23:41.387 --> 23:43.954
about trying to run
some alcohol
in a wood barrel

23:43.956 --> 23:47.625
so we can have
that aged charred flavors
through a clear alcohol.

23:47.627 --> 23:48.592
Dave.

23:48.594 --> 23:50.127
Mike and jerry.

23:50.129 --> 23:53.264
Me and jerry, we are
mutual friend with
a guy named dave angel.

23:53.266 --> 23:55.332
<i>  He owns a distillery here</i>
<i>  in maggie valley.</i>

23:55.334 --> 23:58.769
So we need to go talk
to him and see if we can't get
a few barrels off of him

23:58.771 --> 24:00.504
and try to work out
some kind
of price arrangement.

24:00.506 --> 24:03.908
What we're looking for
is some good charred barrels.

24:03.910 --> 24:05.910
-How many you needing?
-About three.

24:05.912 --> 24:09.313
I just got done
emptying some about two,
three days ago,

24:09.315 --> 24:10.781
so I got a few barrels here.

24:10.783 --> 24:13.317
They were once used up
in kentucky to make bourbon,

24:13.319 --> 24:15.619
so we've reused them
to make whiskey out of them.

24:15.621 --> 24:17.421
They're made out
of american white oak.

24:17.423 --> 24:20.191
That charred layer,
I tell you, the whiskey
I got out of here

24:20.193 --> 24:23.461
had some nice vanilla
and caramel notes in it,
so that should come through.

24:23.463 --> 24:27.264
We're looking to do
some top-quality small-batch
whiskeys this season.

24:27.266 --> 24:29.400
People's got money.
They're ready to spend.

24:29.402 --> 24:31.869
Economy's coming back
and people want
to spend that money.

24:31.871 --> 24:33.437
They want good stuff.
I hear that.

24:33.439 --> 24:35.039
-Here's another big question.
-Yeah.

24:35.041 --> 24:36.907
What do you got
to have for these barrels?

24:36.909 --> 24:39.944
Well, I'm gonna have
to replace them.
I think we can do $150 each.

24:39.946 --> 24:41.145
I'd say that's pretty fair.

24:41.147 --> 24:43.547
And I want me just a taste
of what that tastes like.

24:43.549 --> 24:44.949
[mike]
I'll tell you what we'll do.

24:44.951 --> 24:48.319
We'll bring you
a bottle of our finest

24:48.321 --> 24:51.422
for one of these barrels
and pay you for the other two.
How about that?

24:51.424 --> 24:52.590
I think we could do that.

24:52.592 --> 24:54.558
We'll call it
"experimental research"
for me.

24:54.560 --> 24:55.893
How's that sound?

24:55.895 --> 24:57.528
-Sounds like a deal to
me, brother.
-All right, brother.

24:57.530 --> 24:59.063

we're off to the races.

It beats the alternative.

Well, the day has come
to get in here early
in the morning,

25:30.229 --> 25:33.097
get this mash pumped
over into the steel pot.

25:33.099 --> 25:34.965
Oh, that smells good.

25:34.967 --> 25:38.302
Today is the day,
we run jb's all-corn recipe.

25:38.304 --> 25:39.570
Yeah, that one's ready, boys.

25:40.640 --> 25:42.339
<i>  We come in, check the mash.</i>

last year's calendar.

this little fella right here.

the general vicinity

25:49.549 --> 25:51.415
-it's got to go.
-Yeah.

25:51.417 --> 25:54.552
Well, we've got a bigger pot
than popcorn had.

25:54.554 --> 25:55.953
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

25:55.955 --> 25:58.255
You might can set
the pot right here.

25:58.257 --> 26:00.224
Yeah, that'd work.

26:00.226 --> 26:04.028
We want to put
the still exactly
where popcorn had his.

26:04.030 --> 26:05.896
Let's see how
it'll sit right there.

26:05.898 --> 26:08.999
-Then that'd be real,
real close, jb.
-You're darn right.

26:09.001 --> 26:12.603
It means a lot
to be back here.
It's fond memories.

<i>  since 20 years ago.</i>

26:18.044 --> 26:20.110
"what the hell
them boys are doing?"

26:20.112 --> 26:21.779
finish up what
you're going to finish up.

26:21.781 --> 26:23.180
I'm gonna build us
a little fire

26:23.182 --> 26:25.215
so we can have some
coals cook on here directly.

26:25.217 --> 26:27.184
All righty. Sounds good to me.

26:27.186 --> 26:29.620
I'll work on putting
some mash in the pot.

26:29.622 --> 26:31.322
This is just a small run,

26:31.324 --> 26:33.223
so we're gonna do it
the same way that

26:33.225 --> 26:34.959
<i>  the old man did it</i>
<i>  back in the day.</i>

26:34.961 --> 26:38.429
We're just going to bucket it
from the mash barrel
to the still.

26:38.431 --> 26:40.631
<i>  It's going to be</i>
<i>  a lot different run,</i>

26:40.633 --> 26:45.202
but we want to do it
as close as we possibly could
to the original.

26:45.204 --> 26:47.671
[digger] risk that falls down,
I'm going to rake it back

26:47.673 --> 26:48.973
and get us
a bed of coals going.

26:48.975 --> 26:50.608
I'll get us some...

26:50.610 --> 26:53.377
Bacon going,
and I'll make us some
ramps and eggs.

26:53.379 --> 26:54.545
All right.

26:54.547 --> 26:57.014
That's what you call
ranch lettuce.
That's good stuff.

26:57.016 --> 26:59.416
<i> [digger] popcorn loved to cook</i>
<i>  when he was making liquor.</i>

26:59.418 --> 27:01.452
His menu was limited,

27:01.454 --> 27:04.888
<i>  but he liked to</i>
<i>  flaunt his skills.</i>

27:04.890 --> 27:06.590
<i>  We're going to pay</i>
<i>  homage to that as well,</i>

27:06.592 --> 27:09.059
<i>  but it'll be something</i>
<i>  a little bit different.</i>

27:09.061 --> 27:10.628
We're gonna make
a big run of ramps and eggs

27:10.630 --> 27:12.229
while we run
this liquor.

27:12.231 --> 27:14.164
It's going to be delish.

27:14.166 --> 27:16.400
<i> [mark] digger is gonna feed</i>
<i>  the heck out of us.</i>

27:16.402 --> 27:17.801
We're going to eat good.

27:17.803 --> 27:21.205
Right there under is
some crispy bacon
and fried tater.

27:21.207 --> 27:24.108
-Look what's going in there
next, rader.
-Mmm-mmm.

27:24.110 --> 27:25.976
[jb]
that's the main one there.

27:25.978 --> 27:27.111
[digger] almost right.

27:27.113 --> 27:29.079
[jb]
that's the main ingredient.

27:29.081 --> 27:31.081
I brought my old
cast iron skillet.

27:31.083 --> 27:33.384
[digger] this kind of like
a mixed-up omelet.

27:33.386 --> 27:35.919
-Yep, it is.
-Appalachian style.

27:35.921 --> 27:38.956
[jb] appalachian omelet.
Yeah.

27:38.958 --> 27:41.892
Honestly and truly,
this is our kind of chow.

27:41.894 --> 27:44.094
<i>  This is...</i>
<i>  This is what we love.</i>

27:44.096 --> 27:46.797
They all right?
You've outdone yourself.

27:46.799 --> 27:49.566
This is as country cooking
as it gets.

27:49.568 --> 27:51.168
<i>  This stuff is so good.</i>

27:51.170 --> 27:54.605
I mean, you almost
about got to lay down
to eat it.

27:54.607 --> 27:57.307
[jb] well, we better get
some paste made.

27:57.309 --> 27:59.810
You know, I never thought
in a million years

27:59.812 --> 28:02.279
<i>  that we would ever</i>
<i>  come back to this spot.</i>

28:02.281 --> 28:04.415
-A little more.
-Yeah.

28:04.417 --> 28:07.351
But we thought it was,
you know, just lost to nature.

28:07.353 --> 28:10.187
<i>  And probably</i>
<i>  if jb hadn't brought us</i>
<i>  up here,</i>

28:10.189 --> 28:12.656
it would have continued
to have been forgotten.

28:12.658 --> 28:14.792
[mark] thank god,
jb's the paste master.

28:14.794 --> 28:16.760
We're just trying
to live something

28:16.762 --> 28:19.897
<i>  that we didn't get to live</i>
<i>  20 years ago.</i>

28:19.899 --> 28:23.634
<i>  We're trying to</i>
<i>  relive this thing through jb.</i>

28:23.636 --> 28:25.235
You know,
we're still fortunate.

28:25.237 --> 28:27.938
We're blessed to have
jb with us here still.

28:27.940 --> 28:29.973
-We're getting ready here,
boys.
-Yeah.

28:29.975 --> 28:32.242
-We'll have liquor there,
sure enough, any time.
-Yeah.

28:40.352 --> 28:42.352
Oh, we got liquor coming out.

28:42.354 --> 28:43.887
-[digger] well, we do,
don't we?
-[jb] yeah.

28:43.889 --> 28:46.356
[digger] better put this
ol' coon dodger in.

28:46.358 --> 28:50.427
<i> [jeremy] on hallowed ground</i>
<i>  in maggie valley,</i>
<i>  north carolina,</i>

28:50.429 --> 28:55.232
<i>  mark, digger, and jb</i>
<i>  near completion on</i>
<i>  the first damn run of liquor</i>

28:55.234 --> 28:56.600
<i>  anyone's made here</i>

28:56.602 --> 29:00.270
<i>  since popcorn sutton did his</i>
<i>  last damn run of liquor</i>

29:00.272 --> 29:01.805
<i>  20 years ago.</i>

29:01.807 --> 29:03.640
Seeing this liquor run,
you know,

29:03.642 --> 29:05.542
this... This is wonderful.

29:05.544 --> 29:07.277
-We're gonna get it here,
ain't we, old buddy?
-Yeah.

29:07.279 --> 29:08.479
<i> [digger] we're up here</i>

29:08.481 --> 29:11.181
<i>  in a place that started</i>
<i>  the rage of moonshine</i>

29:11.183 --> 29:13.083
with popcorn and jb.

29:13.085 --> 29:15.919
<i>  I couldn't ask for</i>
<i>  anything better to be sitting</i>
<i>  in this spot right now</i>

29:15.921 --> 29:17.521
and liquor running out of
that worm.

29:17.523 --> 29:20.691
-It's your liquor, jb,
you get the first holdin'.
-All righty.

29:21.660 --> 29:23.527
-Oh, it smells good, digger.
-Oh, god.

29:23.529 --> 29:25.028
It ain't no doubt.

29:28.667 --> 29:31.335
Damn, you ain't never had
a whooping for holding
your breath, have you?

29:31.337 --> 29:32.970
Glad I'm driving you
out of here.

29:34.039 --> 29:35.139
-Here we go.
-What do you think?

29:35.141 --> 29:36.406
Nailed it.

29:36.408 --> 29:38.876
-You like it?
-Damn right I like it.

29:38.878 --> 29:40.377
By god!

29:40.379 --> 29:43.347
You know, 100% corn liquor.

29:43.349 --> 29:45.215
Nothing even compares.

29:45.217 --> 29:48.385
I mean, it's...
It's the best of the best.

29:48.387 --> 29:50.521
I'm glad I got to do this
with you, rader.

29:50.523 --> 29:51.488
I am too.

29:51.490 --> 29:54.324
This still site.
This is hallowed ground.

29:54.326 --> 29:57.928
I sense popcorn's presence
around here.

29:57.930 --> 30:01.632
<i>  I miss him.</i>
<i>  I could see him over</i>
<i>  doing that thump keg walk.</i>

30:02.768 --> 30:06.837
-Yay!
-And here we go. And...

30:06.839 --> 30:08.939
<i> [mark] a lot of things are</i>
<i>  special about today.</i>

30:08.941 --> 30:12.609
None more important than
the fact that we get
to be here with jb.

30:12.611 --> 30:15.846
-We've made
three-and-a-half gallons.
-Yeah, but hell.

30:15.848 --> 30:18.348
We get it all tempered up,
we'll have four.

30:18.350 --> 30:20.017
Fine run on nothing
but grain though.

30:20.019 --> 30:21.151
You're damn right.

30:21.153 --> 30:23.420
-Out of
a little old pot like that.
-Hell yeah.

30:23.422 --> 30:25.022
[digger]
<i>  this liquor right here,</i>

30:25.024 --> 30:27.925
I'll temper it to 103,
and I'll put it in his hands.

30:27.927 --> 30:29.193
It's his liquor.

30:29.195 --> 30:32.396
-Jb, thank you, my brother.
-Yeah.

30:32.398 --> 30:33.597
Rader...

30:33.599 --> 30:35.365
-Yeah. Yeah.
-I love you, brother.

30:35.367 --> 30:37.901
You know, moreover,
this wasn't
about making a big run

30:37.903 --> 30:39.303
to have a lot of quantity.

30:39.305 --> 30:42.573
We were about quality
and paying homage
to popcorn

30:42.575 --> 30:45.008
and honor to jb.

30:45.010 --> 30:46.410
Good and clear, too.

30:46.412 --> 30:47.544
Some powerful stuff,
right there.

30:47.546 --> 30:49.246
Yeah, that's powerful stuff.

30:49.248 --> 30:51.181
<i> [jb] I'm proud of</i>
<i>  what we made today</i>

30:51.183 --> 30:54.251
and I think
popcorn would've been
proud of us.

31:07.233 --> 31:08.365
[henry]
it's looking good, y'all.

31:08.367 --> 31:09.633
Tell you what,
it tastes pretty good,

31:09.635 --> 31:11.468
but it's still got
a couple of days
left to work out.

31:11.470 --> 31:13.403
Yeah, at least
a couple of days, I'd say.

31:13.405 --> 31:16.039
Man, you want to just go on
ahead and get it down to
the still site,

31:16.041 --> 31:17.407
let it finish working off?

31:17.409 --> 31:19.543
Well, I've been thinking
about that.

31:19.545 --> 31:20.444
You know...

31:20.446 --> 31:23.013
Good run in and out
of a still site,

31:23.015 --> 31:25.449
you're taking
a risk every single time
you hit the road.

31:25.451 --> 31:26.650
Every time.

31:26.652 --> 31:30.187
We got that site,
got a lot of money tied up.

31:30.189 --> 31:32.522
We got stills here.
We've got worms here.

31:32.524 --> 31:35.125
We've got an old site
that we used last year.

31:35.127 --> 31:39.296
Why not we take it down
to the old site
and make this one run

31:39.298 --> 31:41.565
and not have
to worry about losing

31:41.567 --> 31:43.433
-the eight
we already got set up?
-Yeah.

31:43.435 --> 31:44.935
I know it's a little more work

31:44.937 --> 31:48.071
setting up a still and all,
but we've got big man
here with us.

31:48.073 --> 31:49.139
It should be pretty easy.

31:49.141 --> 31:51.241
We get set it up, we
get it running and get it out.

31:51.243 --> 31:53.043
You want bryan
to set these in the truck?

31:53.045 --> 31:54.845
-Yeah. Sounds good to me.
-Josh has been working out.

31:54.847 --> 31:56.847
Here's your chance of
hauling that barrel in, boss!

31:56.849 --> 31:59.082
And I believe we'll take
a kubota while
you're all flexing.

32:00.552 --> 32:02.786
This is only gonna make
one still full of mash.

32:02.788 --> 32:05.389
<i>  The risk is not justifiable</i>

32:05.391 --> 32:07.491
to endanger eight pots.

32:07.493 --> 32:08.692
All right, pull it up some.

32:08.694 --> 32:10.027
[tickle]
<i>  so, what we're going to do is</i>

32:10.029 --> 32:12.396
go back down
to one of our old still sites,

32:12.398 --> 32:14.197
<i>  just set up a small pot</i>

32:14.199 --> 32:15.732
and we're gonna run this
green lizard there.

32:18.804 --> 32:21.271
[country music playing]

32:23.375 --> 32:25.242
[tickle]
all right, nothing to it
but to do it.

32:25.244 --> 32:27.878
[henry] these old damn stills
are a whole lot harder to load
than the big ones.

32:27.880 --> 32:30.914
This still site,
it has served us well.

32:30.916 --> 32:33.383
<i>  We've made</i>
<i>  a lot of good liquor here.</i>

32:33.385 --> 32:35.786
<i>  We've done built a bridge</i>
<i>  across the creek.</i>

32:35.788 --> 32:37.621
This still site,
it'll work just fine.

32:37.623 --> 32:39.189
What we wanna do,
we'll split this stick.

32:39.191 --> 32:41.325
That still come on out,
we're going to
do the same thing.

32:41.327 --> 32:42.592
So go back a little bit more.

32:42.594 --> 32:44.995
Maybe a little bit
more work bringing
in all this equipment

32:44.997 --> 32:47.364
<i>  and setting up another</i>
<i>  little still site.</i>

32:47.366 --> 32:49.333
<i>  But it's not like</i>
<i>  we don't have the help</i>

32:49.335 --> 32:51.668
and the equipment
to do it with.

32:51.670 --> 32:53.470
[henry]
now, you all push back.
So, we'll kick out.

32:54.773 --> 32:55.772
Come on, then.

32:56.809 --> 32:58.141
That looks pretty good there.

32:58.143 --> 33:00.911
Man, I'm all fired up
about this green lizard.

33:00.913 --> 33:02.112
All right, there you go.

33:02.114 --> 33:03.981
<i>  Josh's family handed it down</i>

33:03.983 --> 33:06.016
<i>  and telling us</i>
<i>  how great it is.</i>

33:06.018 --> 33:08.185
<i>  We ready to make some</i>
<i>  high-end liquor.</i>

33:08.187 --> 33:09.419
[tickle]
<i>  these watermelon rinds,</i>

33:09.421 --> 33:11.121
<i>  they've been in there</i>
<i>  long enough.</i>

33:11.123 --> 33:12.990
<i>  We're going to drain</i>
<i>  the solids out,</i>

33:12.992 --> 33:15.892
get it over into our pot
to finish fermenting.

33:15.894 --> 33:18.328
<i>  And in the meantime,</i>
<i>  we can get everything else</i>
<i>  together</i>

33:18.330 --> 33:21.865
that we need to set this up
as a working still site.

33:21.867 --> 33:23.800
That's it right there, boss.
It's full.

33:23.802 --> 33:25.035
That's what we want.

33:25.037 --> 33:26.269
Cover this baby up.

33:26.271 --> 33:28.071
[tickle] all right, let's get
the hell out of here.

33:28.073 --> 33:29.639
Now, that we got
the mash in the still...

33:29.641 --> 33:31.108
Let's roll.

33:31.110 --> 33:33.477
...It's only going to be
a matter of a few days.

33:33.479 --> 33:35.779
We're gonna be able
to come back down here
and run this thing.

33:50.662 --> 33:52.029
Let's see if we can
get this barrel off

33:52.031 --> 33:53.196
and get a core in it,
what do you think?

33:53.198 --> 33:54.765
Something like that, bubba.

33:54.767 --> 33:57.300
Me and jerry,
we're making a still out of
a wooden barrel.

33:57.302 --> 33:58.969
-You got it?
-Oh, yeah.

33:58.971 --> 34:02.139
Usually, it's done been
mashed in even before
we got a still completed,

34:02.141 --> 34:04.775
because we got all these
barrels that laid out
in the woods.

34:04.777 --> 34:07.611
In this case, we're
going to be mashing it
inside the still.

34:07.613 --> 34:10.080
I'm just ready to get
this damn thing built
and get in the woods.

34:10.082 --> 34:11.581
And I'm ready to get
a run done.

34:11.583 --> 34:12.482
Heard that, man.

34:12.484 --> 34:13.817
Basically, what
we're trying to do

34:13.819 --> 34:15.852
is we're going to try to use
an american white oak barrel

34:15.854 --> 34:17.487
<i>  to mash in and run.</i>

34:17.489 --> 34:19.523
And how we're gonna do
that is we're gonna put
a core

34:19.525 --> 34:20.657
<i>  through the center</i>
<i>  of this thing.</i>

34:20.692 --> 34:23.126
<i>  This metal core can heat it</i>
<i>  from the inside out.</i>

34:23.128 --> 34:27.030
We can't just put a fire out
under the barrel.
It'll burn the barrel up.

34:27.032 --> 34:29.232
[gasps] smells like whiskey!

34:29.234 --> 34:30.434
[jerry] check that out.

34:30.436 --> 34:32.135
[mike] yeah, well,
there's liquor in there.

34:32.137 --> 34:33.303
We can bottle that up.

34:33.305 --> 34:35.772
There's no damn way
I'm letting this go to waste.

34:35.774 --> 34:38.141
<i> We're going to go drain it out</i>
<i>  and take us a snort of it</i>

34:38.143 --> 34:39.409
and keep it for later on.

34:41.246 --> 34:42.913
[jerry]
what do you think? Hot?

34:42.915 --> 34:44.414
It's good, by god.
But it's hot.

34:44.416 --> 34:45.849
Let me try it.

34:45.851 --> 34:47.250
God dang.

34:47.252 --> 34:49.186
I'll tell you what, boy,
this whiskey it's strong

34:49.188 --> 34:51.288
and it's got a really
good taste to it.

34:51.290 --> 34:54.057
<i>  You can taste</i>
<i>  the white oak barrel</i>
<i> coming through it all the way.</i>

34:54.059 --> 34:55.425
I mean, it's charred.

34:55.427 --> 34:58.462
I believe we're
going to be in damn hot
with this charred barrel.

34:58.464 --> 35:02.165
That's what we need
for this mash to potentially
have its flavor.

35:02.167 --> 35:04.301
[jerry] well, get to
rolling this core,
get her soldered up.

35:04.303 --> 35:06.536
[mike] and we got to put this
right in that damn hole
right there.

35:06.538 --> 35:07.370
And it's got to fit.

35:07.372 --> 35:08.472
Yeah, I know.

35:08.474 --> 35:11.374
Making a 4-inch core
about 36 inches long,

35:11.376 --> 35:13.610
stick straight through
the middle of this barrel.

35:13.612 --> 35:15.612
It's sealed, baby.

35:15.614 --> 35:17.114
<i>  You know,</i>
<i>  the most important thing</i>

35:17.116 --> 35:18.548
<i>  about this whole entire</i>
<i>  build here</i>

35:18.550 --> 35:21.885
is getting this core
slammed through the center

35:21.887 --> 35:23.820
<i>  nice and tight where</i>
<i>  nothing's going to leak.</i>

35:23.822 --> 35:26.490
<i>  That's my biggest concern</i>
<i>  with this whole rig</i>

35:26.492 --> 35:28.925
that we're going to sit here
and leak out mash out

35:28.927 --> 35:30.961
before we ever
get a chance to run it.

35:30.963 --> 35:32.662
There it is, right there.

35:32.664 --> 35:33.997
That looks pretty good, mike.

35:33.999 --> 35:36.166
Now that we got the core
through the barrel,
all we got to do is

35:36.168 --> 35:39.970
flange one end's direction
with this hammer as we go.
That way, it's a perfect fit.

35:39.972 --> 35:42.739
With the flange to it,
let's see what it looks like.

35:42.741 --> 35:44.841
<i> [jerry] I am super excited</i>
<i>  to get this thing</i>
<i>  in the woods.</i>

35:44.843 --> 35:47.978
You know, to my knowledge,
I have never seen anything
like this done before.

35:47.980 --> 35:51.248
<i>  And if it works out good,</i>
<i>  it can be a whole new</i>
<i>  stepping stone</i>

35:51.250 --> 35:52.516
for the moonshine industry.

35:52.518 --> 35:54.117
[mike] looks good, don't it?

35:54.119 --> 35:58.054
My only concern, I think
I need to solder this seam
a little bit more.

35:58.056 --> 36:00.624
These flanges should be
air and watertight.

36:00.626 --> 36:03.460
You can see it right there,
but I'll tell you, I'd like
to come on up with it.

36:03.462 --> 36:06.963
And I noticed my solder joint
soldered good all the way up,

36:06.965 --> 36:09.599
but I want to put just a
little more solder to kind of

36:09.601 --> 36:11.868
ease on up with it up
toward that wood.

36:11.870 --> 36:13.003
Let's do it.

36:13.005 --> 36:15.472
Right. I am gonna solder it
from the inside.

36:16.375 --> 36:17.407
Whoa!

36:18.010 --> 36:18.942
[groaning] dang it!

36:18.944 --> 36:20.377
Oh, god!

36:20.379 --> 36:22.512
[groaning]

36:30.622 --> 36:32.422
[digger]
they have ramps everywhere.

36:32.424 --> 36:35.091
Oh, there's
plenty right there,
plenty more right there.

36:35.093 --> 36:37.561
I might pick this little mess.

36:37.563 --> 36:39.996
You get up around
west virginia,
they call them wild leeks.

36:39.998 --> 36:41.364
We call them ramps.

36:41.366 --> 36:43.533
<i>  They come up for</i>
<i>  about three weeks out</i>
<i>  of the year</i>

36:43.535 --> 36:45.368
<i>  and they're a delicacy.</i>

36:45.370 --> 36:47.604
These big clumps like this,
you've got to work for them.

36:47.606 --> 36:50.941
They make you work at it.
And there's your prize
right there.

36:50.943 --> 36:53.109
Fry you up a couple
of pounds of bacon,

36:53.111 --> 36:56.112
throw them ramps in there
and you've got a meal fit
for a king,

36:56.114 --> 36:57.447
and they are delicious.

36:57.449 --> 36:59.916
But they'll make
your breath nuclear.

36:59.918 --> 37:02.519
I guess that's why we
like them. That way,
nobody gets in your face.

37:03.956 --> 37:05.956
[mike] I think I need
to solder this seam
a little bit more.

37:05.958 --> 37:07.057
Let's do it.

37:07.059 --> 37:08.592
I'm gonna solder it
from the inside.

37:09.294 --> 37:10.393
Whoa!

37:10.796 --> 37:12.462
Damn!

37:12.464 --> 37:13.563
Oh, god!

37:14.600 --> 37:16.700
[mike groaning
and gasping]

37:19.972 --> 37:21.304
<i>  stick the flame to it,</i>

37:21.340 --> 37:25.342
that bastard blows up
the side of my head,
burns my arm all up.

37:25.344 --> 37:27.611
[bleep] barrel blowed up
with alcohol in it.

37:27.613 --> 37:31.081
I need something, I need...
I need something
to get on my arm.

37:31.083 --> 37:33.283
It [bleep] got me up all
the way down through here.

37:33.285 --> 37:36.786
If my face would have been
one inch closer to that hole,

37:36.788 --> 37:39.623
I'd be in a bad burn unit
some damn where right now.

37:39.625 --> 37:41.992
That could have got somebody
damn killed right there.

37:43.195 --> 37:46.496
I'm gonna be fine.
It's burnt, it's burnt up

37:46.498 --> 37:49.633
and it come up the side
of my damn head.

37:49.635 --> 37:53.103
We're just trying to get
the build done
and wasn't thinking.

37:54.172 --> 37:56.139
Alcohol vapor is volatile.

37:56.141 --> 37:59.976
When you put flame
to volatile vapor,
it's going to explode.

37:59.978 --> 38:01.811
Me and mike just
poured a gallon of alcohol
in this thing.

38:01.813 --> 38:04.281
I mean, we might as well have
poured gas out of this barrel.

38:04.283 --> 38:05.849
This barrel could have
blown apart to shreds,

38:05.851 --> 38:08.184
and this thing would have
splintered apart, lost eyes.

38:08.186 --> 38:10.287
I mean, I'd even
hate to think
what would have happened.

38:11.256 --> 38:12.656
Man, you all right?

38:12.791 --> 38:16.126
I'm gonna make it, man.
That scared me to damn death,
I know that.

38:16.128 --> 38:18.295
You know the crazy thing
about it is,
both of us is welders.

38:18.297 --> 38:20.664
I don't know why
neither one of us
was thinking about this,

38:20.666 --> 38:22.799
but here we are
in a damn hurry.

38:22.801 --> 38:26.569
Building a damn still pot
that's already soaked
in alcohol vapors.

38:26.571 --> 38:28.238
<i>  I'm beginning to think</i>
<i>  me and jerry</i>

38:28.240 --> 38:30.373
both ain't nothing but
a bunch of dumbasses.

38:31.376 --> 38:33.510
God almighty dang, man.

38:33.512 --> 38:37.047
Look at that, man.
Flatter than a pancake, son.

38:37.049 --> 38:38.048
Whoo!

38:40.185 --> 38:41.351
[mike] well, that right there

38:41.353 --> 38:45.055
prime damn example
of damn alcohol fumes
in a vacuum.

38:45.057 --> 38:47.524
You know, the only damn thing
that's going through
my mind right now,

38:47.526 --> 38:49.459
<i>  we're down on our luck.</i>
<i>  We're broke.</i>

38:49.461 --> 38:51.061
We're on the other side
of the mountain.

38:51.063 --> 38:54.764
<i>  Ain't nothing we can do now,</i>
<i>  but start all damn over.</i>

38:54.766 --> 38:57.701
I'm beginning to think
our damn season's over
before it ever gets started.

39:07.446 --> 39:09.746
[country music playing]

39:09.748 --> 39:12.515
straight back, all right.
That's it. Good.

39:12.517 --> 39:13.917
[josh] all right, though!

39:13.919 --> 39:16.319
Well, today's the day.
We're gonna run
the green lizard,

39:16.321 --> 39:21.157
got to bring everything in
worms, caps,
all that expensive stuff.

39:21.159 --> 39:24.227
She's ready?
Gonna make some money,
some green lizard, baby.

39:24.229 --> 39:26.062
<i> [tickle] we've had a few</i>
<i>  battles to fight.</i>

39:26.064 --> 39:28.365
First off, it was
supposed to be strawberry.

39:28.367 --> 39:29.899
<i>  We managed</i>
<i>  with the watermelons</i>

39:29.901 --> 39:32.635
and it filled up one
of our small pots.

39:32.637 --> 39:33.870
All right.

39:33.872 --> 39:35.438
<i>  By the time you split</i>
<i>  a dollar up five ways,</i>

39:35.440 --> 39:38.074
<i>  don't no nobody got</i>
<i>  enough money to buy anything.</i>

39:38.076 --> 39:40.310
<i>  We're going to have to go</i>
<i>  a whole lot bigger this year.</i>

39:40.312 --> 39:42.312
<i>  We got to pump liquor</i>
<i>  and keep it going.</i>

39:42.314 --> 39:43.613
We got to get us more fruit.

39:43.615 --> 39:45.315
Oh!

39:45.317 --> 39:48.151
I hate that freaking pump.
I mean, listen to it.

39:48.153 --> 39:49.619
<i>  That pump is so loud,</i>
<i>  you can hear it</i>

39:49.621 --> 39:51.054
<i>  for a quarter of a mile,</i>
<i>  half a mile,</i>

39:51.056 --> 39:52.789
but we don't have to
run it very long,

39:52.791 --> 39:55.325
just long enough
to fill that water box up.

39:55.327 --> 39:56.426
All right.

39:57.662 --> 39:58.795
Damn that pump's loud.

39:58.797 --> 40:00.163
[henry] so we'll be firing
in a second.

40:01.099 --> 40:02.565
[josh] go ahead
and fire that bitch up.

40:03.835 --> 40:05.702
Don't pull that hose out.
Don't pull that hose out!

40:05.704 --> 40:09.339
Hold on. Put that block
on that hose,
so it won't pull out.

40:09.341 --> 40:10.540
There you go.

40:10.542 --> 40:12.242
Lights, camera, action.

40:13.879 --> 40:15.612
There you go.

40:15.614 --> 40:17.781
Won't be long.
We'll have some
green lizard.

40:17.783 --> 40:19.482
I tell you what,
it smells real good.

40:19.484 --> 40:21.317
Hell yeah,
it's going to be good.
I am telling you.

40:21.319 --> 40:22.952
-That better be good.
-It will be.

40:22.954 --> 40:24.354
[tickle]
it's all lizard liquor.

40:24.356 --> 40:25.555
A lizard liquor.

40:25.557 --> 40:27.357
Yes, sir,
it's all lizard liquor.

40:27.359 --> 40:28.358
Are you a lizard licker?

40:28.360 --> 40:29.392
[tickle laughing]

40:29.394 --> 40:31.161
on a normal basis,
if somebody told me

40:31.163 --> 40:33.396
something was called
green lizard, I wouldn't
want to drink it,

40:33.398 --> 40:35.465
<i>  but I know what</i>
<i>  went into this.</i>

40:35.467 --> 40:37.834
And, uh, hell, I'll drink
any liquor we make.

40:37.836 --> 40:41.671
Where's your cap at?
We'll get some paste
made up, or something.

40:41.673 --> 40:46.242
Baking cornbread.
They don't know it yet.
That's not too bad.

40:46.244 --> 40:48.578
[tickle]
don't eat up the damn paste.

40:48.580 --> 40:50.880
I'm really excited about
making the green lizard.

40:50.882 --> 40:52.449
I think we oughta
go ahead and cap it off.

40:52.451 --> 40:54.150
It's been steaming
for a few minutes now.

40:54.152 --> 40:55.218
I grew up with it,

40:55.220 --> 40:56.786
<i>  and the old-timers</i>
<i>  would say,</i>

40:56.788 --> 40:59.222
"hey, take a drink
off of this stuff right here!

40:59.224 --> 41:01.324
<i>  This'll put some</i>
<i>  hair on your chest.</i>

41:01.326 --> 41:04.594
Either put it on
or take it off, warn.
I guarantee you.

41:04.596 --> 41:05.829
This thing's good.

41:05.831 --> 41:07.797
That's green lizard, baby.
That's what we want.

41:07.799 --> 41:09.365
<i> [henry] it's so good to get</i>
<i>  outside again.</i>

41:09.367 --> 41:11.634
You know, we were
inside through the winter
and that was okay.

41:11.636 --> 41:13.903
<i>  But there's nothing like</i>
<i>  getting out in the woods,</i>

41:13.905 --> 41:17.207
setting up on a nice creek.
All that nice fresh air.

41:17.209 --> 41:19.809
Here you go, bryan,
you need you some paste
over yonder?

41:19.811 --> 41:21.911
-Yeah.
-All right, there you go.

41:21.913 --> 41:23.346
Y'all got enough over yonder?

41:23.348 --> 41:25.482
[josh]
this stuff works awesome.

41:25.484 --> 41:27.050
Somebody's coming
across the bridge.

41:27.052 --> 41:27.784
[man yelling]
