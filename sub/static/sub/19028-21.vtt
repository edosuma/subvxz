00:03.202 --> 00:06.534
<i>The reason time had slowdown was
because I had just been blindsided</i>

00:06.535 --> 00:08.460
<i>by the two most important women in my life.</i>

00:09.005 --> 00:10.583
<i>First, Elliot asked me this...</i>

00:11.109 --> 00:11.709
JD...

00:12.826 --> 00:14.851
Do you think I'm making
a mistake by marrying Keith?

00:15.399 --> 00:18.911
<i>And then my ex-girlfriend Kim, who had
lied and told me she had a miscarriage</i>

00:19.099 --> 00:21.584
<i>followed me back from a medical
convention and asked me this...</i>

00:22.082 --> 00:22.702
JD...

00:23.849 --> 00:25.361
How could you just leave me there?

00:26.009 --> 00:27.671
Holy frick! You're still pregnant!

00:28.450 --> 00:30.128
Hey, do you think that I should marry Keith?

00:30.138 --> 00:33.536
<i>Fortunately, Carla had
special maid-of-honor radar</i>

00:33.537 --> 00:35.332
<i>that let her know
when Elliot was obsessing.</i>

00:39.343 --> 00:41.311
Elliot, I already told you...

00:41.312 --> 00:43.980
you're just going through
some pre-wedding panic, here.

00:45.248 --> 00:48.431
This is how it'll feel when you'll
walk out of that church married.

00:49.586 --> 00:50.347
Clap, dammit!

00:53.154 --> 00:53.746
Thank you!

00:55.849 --> 00:56.713
Thank you all!

00:57.794 --> 00:59.089
Look, I know you're angry.

00:59.606 --> 01:02.637
But you promised we'd talk, and then you
just left me stranded there at that bar.

01:02.958 --> 01:04.028
You know what? You're right.

01:04.479 --> 01:06.920
I'm sorry. Let me just
file these, and we'll talk.

01:07.315 --> 01:07.981
Great.

01:13.784 --> 01:14.112
Hello?

01:15.709 --> 01:17.230
How could you do this to me again?

01:17.231 --> 01:20.075
Cut me some slack! I just found
out I'm still having a baby.

01:20.479 --> 01:21.155
I get it.

01:21.558 --> 01:24.214
Look, I just ordered a cup of coffee.
I know you can't have caffeine,

01:24.215 --> 01:26.309
but you want me to get you some
tea and we can sit and talk?

01:26.657 --> 01:28.112
That would be great.

01:32.826 --> 01:33.784
It's open, Kim.

01:36.056 --> 01:37.292
JD, what the hell?

01:37.326 --> 01:39.915
Ok, that one was a little
excessive. I'm sorry.

01:39.916 --> 01:42.727
It's just that every time I think about
running away, I look at the fat guy

01:42.728 --> 01:45.468
in the track suit with a giant rabbit
head, and he doesn't say anything.

01:46.024 --> 01:47.376
Ok, elaborating would help.

01:47.873 --> 01:49.244
He's my conscience!

01:49.245 --> 01:52.869
I realized that I'd listen to it more if
I imagined something I was really afraid of.

01:53.254 --> 01:55.414
The track suit, because I had this mean

01:55.415 --> 01:57.508
Phys Ed teacher in high school
named Mr. Fratelli,

01:57.894 --> 02:01.377
and the rabbit head, because my uncle
once ate a rabbit and he got belly worms.

02:01.863 --> 02:06.335
Look, I wanted to talk to you because,
well, the baby's due in a month

02:07.590 --> 02:12.013
and I guess I was hoping that you'd want me
to have it here, y' know, so that we could...

02:12.895 --> 02:14.820
go through it together.

02:17.554 --> 02:18.239
Really?

02:18.699 --> 02:20.070
I'm sorry, Kim.

02:20.276 --> 02:21.866
This is a big deal for me.

02:22.534 --> 02:24.097
I think I need to be alone right now.

02:25.111 --> 02:26.989
Thanks for being alone with me, Choco.

02:27.722 --> 02:28.848
So, what should I do?

02:29.112 --> 02:30.764
Oh, that's a tough call.

02:32.071 --> 02:34.428
When it comes to babies, women are crazy.

02:37.254 --> 02:39.320
If you would please,

02:39.442 --> 02:41.982
can you hold her by that
rim over there? Right?

02:42.385 --> 02:46.416
I'm gonna Photoshop a basketball
into her hand and Photoshop you out!

02:46.517 --> 02:48.347
Everybody's gonna
think my baby can dunk. Right?

02:48.826 --> 02:50.056
It's gonna be crazy!

02:50.563 --> 02:52.066
Maybe I should ask another dad.

02:53.286 --> 02:57.238
I know what Kim did to you was
just crazy, but pregnant women

02:57.239 --> 03:01.435
are among a selected group of people
who are actually allowed to act insane,

03:01.436 --> 03:06.053
much like sport's mascots, local weathermen,
theme park performers, and that guy with

03:06.054 --> 03:09.976
the question marked jacket who teaches people
how to get free money from the government.

03:10.596 --> 03:13.535
Besides, we're talking about your kid.

03:15.423 --> 03:17.301
I think we both know what you're gonna do.

03:18.721 --> 03:19.548
Ok, I'm in.

03:20.175 --> 03:21.963
- Really?
- Yeah, you can even stay here.

03:22.366 --> 03:25.013
- But this is only a one bedroom.
- This couch isn't that uncomfortable.

03:25.583 --> 03:26.290
Thanks.

03:27.161 --> 03:29.467
Actually, I'm gonna go
lie down right now, huh!

03:30.549 --> 03:33.125
Wowowowo, you get the couch,
I get the bed. Was that not clear?

03:33.591 --> 03:36.077
Dorian, she's pregnant! Give her the bed!

03:36.888 --> 03:38.358
Fine, you can have the bed.

03:38.592 --> 03:39.991
You're a great guy, JD.

03:46.339 --> 03:49.513
Dorian, don't watch a nudie movie,
with the mother of your child

03:49.514 --> 03:51.094
- in the next room!
- Really?

03:51.619 --> 03:53.093
No, I'm cool with it.

03:53.403 --> 03:55.788
Whooo, have I got a carrot for her!

04:12.584 --> 04:16.029
<i>Since Kim didn't have an o.b. here in town,
we made her an appointment at the hospital.</i>

04:16.584 --> 04:19.843
<i>Unfortunately, that meant she had
to face all the people who were mad at her</i>

04:19.844 --> 04:23.355
<i>for what she'd done. There was
my best friend, who was furious,</i>

04:23.825 --> 04:27.186
<i>and my mentor, who was equally
upset but didn't wanna show it.</i>

04:27.187 --> 04:28.651
- Hi, Kim.
- Hey, Perry.

04:29.158 --> 04:32.107
<i>And other acquaintances, who were
much more loyal than I thought.</i>

04:32.285 --> 04:33.478
- Hussy!
- Liar!

04:33.740 --> 04:34.341
Jerk!

04:35.111 --> 04:36.079
Who is that?

04:37.440 --> 04:41.228
All this group anger's made me hungry! Of
course, everything makes me hungry right now.

04:42.289 --> 04:43.481
Well, I have to go to check out a patient.

04:43.482 --> 04:44.796
- I'll meet you upstairs?
- Great.

04:45.560 --> 04:48.396
Hem, by the way, all this sympathy
that's coming your way, that's gonna turn,

04:48.593 --> 04:52.725
and when it does, I'm gonna be here, and
I'm going to enjoy... Hey! Not finished!

04:55.004 --> 04:55.427
It.

04:58.714 --> 05:01.551
Mr. Fulton, the reason you're having
chronic pain and trouble walking

05:01.552 --> 05:03.919
is you have peripheral arterial disease.

05:04.044 --> 05:05.232
How do you treat it?

05:05.409 --> 05:07.394
Well, that's why I brought in
a surgical consult.

05:07.395 --> 05:09.612
- Dr. Turk...
- One second, please.

05:09.613 --> 05:12.716
<i>Turk liked patients to see him
intensively studying their charts</i>

05:12.811 --> 05:14.241
<i>because he felt it instilled confidence.</i>

05:14.628 --> 05:17.145
<i>Only I knew the clipboard was blank.</i>

05:17.146 --> 05:18.929
Interesting stuff.

05:19.382 --> 05:22.347
We are gonna discuss some
options and get back to you.

05:22.382 --> 05:25.081
<i>Since Turk was a surgeon,
he always had the same answer.</i>

05:25.246 --> 05:26.921
I'm slicin' that guy open.

05:27.021 --> 05:29.286
Vascular surgery on a guy his age?

05:29.386 --> 05:30.807
Dude, I've done tons of these.

05:30.907 --> 05:33.446
And yes, there's a risk.
But with this type of surgery,

05:33.546 --> 05:35.332
his quality of life would improve like that.

05:35.562 --> 05:37.541
Tommy, here, could be
playing tennis by the weekend.

05:37.967 --> 05:39.291
What do you think, Perry?

05:39.426 --> 05:42.504
Let me phrase my response
in the form of a riddle:

05:42.496 --> 05:44.258
What's black and white,

05:44.358 --> 05:47.177
and should never, ever, ever,

05:47.277 --> 05:49.311
be allowed inside of a hospital?

05:49.312 --> 05:51.421
Oh, is it Lloyd e Sharise?

05:51.422 --> 05:54.979
Because their PDA has gotten out of control.

05:58.610 --> 06:02.256
And yet, you two still nauseate me more.

06:05.398 --> 06:08.064
Oh, my God!

06:08.065 --> 06:10.355
Is it still funny to yell "get a room"?

06:10.356 --> 06:11.931
I don't care, I'm going for it.

06:12.395 --> 06:13.705
Get a room!

06:16.663 --> 06:16.996
Hey, guys.

06:18.665 --> 06:18.965
Hey, Kim.

06:20.270 --> 06:21.326
How could you be so nice to her?

06:21.361 --> 06:22.756
- That was not nice. That was neutral!
- Neutral!

06:22.757 --> 06:24.205
"Hey, Kim!". That's neutral?!

06:24.215 --> 06:25.015
She's with child.

06:25.050 --> 06:26.154
- Oh, so, she's with child..
- Fine!

06:26.861 --> 06:27.493
I'll do it over.

06:28.712 --> 06:29.159
Kim.

06:31.767 --> 06:32.932
Great.

06:33.771 --> 06:34.995
Ugh, that sucked!

06:35.730 --> 06:37.173
How did you get so good at being mean?

06:37.208 --> 06:38.596
It gets much easier when you're married.

06:38.857 --> 06:41.995
Ah! Speaking of which, I'm
throwing you a bachelorette party.

06:42.231 --> 06:43.062
Carla!

06:43.063 --> 06:45.828
I'm your maid of honor and you
haven't let me do anything yet!

06:45.829 --> 06:48.555
Since you've got engaged you've
become much more of a control freak.

06:48.590 --> 06:49.943
Oh, I'm not that bad.

06:50.048 --> 06:51.367
You wrote my wedding toast.

06:51.502 --> 06:53.527
Yeah, I just wanted to make sure
there weren't any sex jokes in there,

06:53.705 --> 06:55.177
because my grandma
Lati still thinks I'm a virgin,

06:55.277 --> 06:57.253
despite what was painted
on our town's water tower.

06:57.527 --> 06:58.634
And what about your honeymoon?

07:00.618 --> 07:02.656
I just want a hotel that's on the beach.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.447
Oh, and it's got to have
a bathroom with a bidet.

07:04.547 --> 07:06.798
'cause I cannot wear my going-out thong
if I've got sand in my patootie.

07:07.121 --> 07:09.126
That's why Travelocity's so great.

07:09.127 --> 07:10.874
You can compare 4 hotels at once,

07:10.974 --> 07:13.118
plus, there's tons of
user reviews to help you.

07:13.376 --> 07:15.001
See, wouldn't I make a great spokesperson?

07:15.308 --> 07:17.479
Screw Hawaii.
You know where you should go?

07:17.804 --> 07:20.457
Turk, for the last time. There's
no place called Cocoa Mo.

07:20.492 --> 07:22.541
Where'd the Beach Boys shoot the video, huh?

07:23.418 --> 07:24.587
I'm going to Hawaii.

07:26.038 --> 07:27.180
I'm booked.

07:27.181 --> 07:28.023
Hey, babe.

07:28.489 --> 07:30.703
Still thinking about going
skiing for our honeymoon?

07:30.827 --> 07:32.996
Oh, sure sweetie.
That's a total possibility.

07:34.844 --> 07:36.376
Ok, so I know what I like.

07:38.021 --> 07:39.428
Kim, everything looks good.

07:40.112 --> 07:42.307
But since you're a new patient,
I'd like to do an ultrasound.

07:42.712 --> 07:43.762
I'll be right back.

07:44.284 --> 07:45.682
I hate ultrasounds.

07:46.034 --> 07:48.319
That gel feels like a whale
hocked a loogie on my belly.

07:48.720 --> 07:51.525
Plus, I'm always afraid in the first few seconds
they're not gonna feel a little heartbeat.

07:51.723 --> 07:55.097
Relax, Kim. Dorians are known
for their strong will to live.

07:55.351 --> 07:59.319
JD, thank you for being here. It's making it
a lot easier to get through this.

08:00.073 --> 08:01.636
Well, I'm glad I'm here.

08:02.615 --> 08:05.958
So, do you wanna know the sex of the baby?
Because I've already found out.

08:07.104 --> 08:07.985
Hit me.

08:08.331 --> 08:09.330
It's a boy.

08:10.389 --> 08:13.950
A boy! What's his name?

08:13.951 --> 08:15.953
He didn't say. We have to pick one.

08:16.388 --> 08:18.122
Can we name him Sam, after my dad?

08:18.322 --> 08:21.165
After what I did to you, you can name
this kid whatever the hell you want.

08:21.243 --> 08:23.648
We can name him Sam Perry Gilligan Dorian?

08:24.151 --> 08:27.819
- Perry just 'cause I kinda like the ring to it.
- Sure.

08:28.080 --> 08:30.305
And Gilligan 'cause
I've lost that bet to Turk.

08:30.306 --> 08:33.970
Those are all better than anything
nerdy like Aragorn or Chewbecca.

08:34.306 --> 08:35.604
Turk has dibs on Chewy.

08:39.155 --> 08:42.379
Turk, should I get a male stripper
for Elliot's bachelorette party?

08:42.414 --> 08:46.622
Are you, uh, looking for
a caucasian boy or more exotic fare?

08:47.252 --> 08:48.050
What?

08:48.051 --> 08:51.943
Once spring rolls around,
Enid gets a little randy,

08:51.986 --> 08:55.580
so I throw a twenty to Churro,
our neighbour's guatemalan house boy,

08:55.605 --> 08:58.499
to get in our basement and let
Enid chase him around in a wheelchair

08:58.500 --> 08:59.734
until the juice runs out.

09:00.939 --> 09:02.512
Churro hates America.

09:02.756 --> 09:04.115
Yeah, I wonder why.

09:04.659 --> 09:08.223
Ok, Mr. Fulton, it's almost
time to prep you for surgery.

09:08.929 --> 09:11.608
Hello! Cute grandaughter.

09:11.631 --> 09:14.172
Actually... she's my daughter.

09:14.990 --> 09:17.848
Congratulations.
I've got a daughter too.

09:19.984 --> 09:22.721
Six months. Already playing basketball.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.687
So, check out the party plans.

09:31.004 --> 09:34.133
A limo takes all the girls to the spa
for a Margi-Marti-Pedi-Party.

09:34.408 --> 09:36.032
That's Margaritas, Martinis e Pedicures.

09:36.033 --> 09:38.274
Oh, what about a Margi Marti Mani Pedi Party?

09:38.275 --> 09:41.673
You can't get manis! You need your hands
free for the Margaritas and the Martinis.

09:41.674 --> 09:44.095
- Oh, Carla, this rocks!
- I know... - Oh-oh.

09:44.428 --> 09:46.715
What? What? What can possibly be wrong?

09:46.716 --> 09:50.374
Well, I just noticed that you've
put Ronni Ippolito on the list.

09:51.499 --> 09:54.080
See, I just like being the only girl
on the list with a boy's name.

09:54.180 --> 09:55.994
And I find it odd that
a month after I started working here

09:55.995 --> 09:58.098
she changes her name from Veronica to Ronni.

09:58.188 --> 10:00.951
Heh, sure Ronni claims that it's 'cause
she doesn't want the same name as her mom.

10:01.493 --> 10:04.704
Because her mum snapped
and set fire to that pre-school.

10:04.804 --> 10:06.461
But I still think it's a
tinsy bit coinkidinky!

10:06.752 --> 10:09.051
- No problem, Ronni is out.
- Wait, I'm not sure yet.

10:09.202 --> 10:12.401
I mean, Ronni has also got, like,
the best crazy mum stories.

10:12.501 --> 10:17.559
We are talking multiple felonies, including
the attempted assassination of a federal judge.

10:17.560 --> 10:20.186
- Oh... Fun!
- Right?

10:20.286 --> 10:23.738
Plus, I'm not so sure we don't
wanna have a sit-down dinner,

10:23.739 --> 10:25.766
You know, maybe do something
a little less girly,

10:25.767 --> 10:28.846
like bowling, or paintball, or fight club.

10:30.701 --> 10:32.256
Ok, let's make a list.

10:32.650 --> 10:33.596
Sounds great.

10:37.013 --> 10:38.965
And that's his heart, right there.

10:41.418 --> 10:44.751
Wow! That's amazing.

10:45.398 --> 10:48.864
Just don't get freaked out by how big his head
is in comparison to the rest of his body.

10:50.472 --> 10:51.776
Trick or treat!

10:51.988 --> 10:55.774
What great costumes!
I wouldn't recognize any of you.

10:55.974 --> 10:59.208
Well, except for you.
You're Dorians' kid.

10:59.209 --> 11:00.446
Damn it!

11:02.113 --> 11:05.033
I bet you could fit a lot of candy
corns in those cheeks.

11:07.822 --> 11:12.398
I just hope he doesn't get my dad's dainty hands
and my mom's patchy facial hair,

11:12.498 --> 11:14.233
and, no, I didn't pluck those.

11:14.317 --> 11:16.845
I just want what every
father wants for his son...

11:17.296 --> 11:21.869
Health, happiness and a life long
obsession with American Musical Theatre.

11:23.203 --> 11:26.823
This has been the first good day for me
in a long time, JD. Thank you.

11:27.403 --> 11:28.668
I'm glad.

11:29.246 --> 11:31.897
- I have to admit something.
- Oh-oh.

11:32.710 --> 11:36.058
Last night, when I went
into your room, I couldn't fall asleep.

11:36.059 --> 11:40.309
I just... laid on the bed staring at the door,

11:41.697 --> 11:43.031
hoping you might come in.

11:44.189 --> 11:45.456
- Kim...
- I know,

11:45.522 --> 11:49.084
you don't trust me, and I
don't even know if you like me.

11:49.085 --> 11:50.845
I don't really like myself right now.

11:51.408 --> 11:53.793
But do you think there's a
one in a million chance

11:53.794 --> 11:56.297
that a year from now, or 5 years from now

11:56.397 --> 11:59.394
you could get to a place
where you forgive me, and then maybe,

12:00.101 --> 12:00.880
you know,

12:02.528 --> 12:04.288
We could give it another shot?

12:04.855 --> 12:06.760
<i>"No" is a powerful word.</i>

12:08.295 --> 12:10.361
<i>It can surprise a colleague...</i>

12:11.248 --> 12:13.522
Aren't you suppose to do
surgery on that guy today?

12:13.820 --> 12:16.508
No. I decided to cancel it.

12:20.017 --> 12:23.274
Ok, I just got us into a great gay bar
for some grope-free dancing,

12:23.275 --> 12:25.661
then I just have to call
a few restaurants.

12:26.067 --> 12:28.164
<i>"No" can piss off a friend...</i>

12:28.779 --> 12:31.681
- Do you want some help, Elliot?
- No, Carla, I've got it.

12:35.818 --> 12:40.072
<i>Luckily with Kim it was easy just
to say "yes" and make her feel better.</i>

12:40.420 --> 12:45.428
No, Kim, I'm sorry.
There's not any chance.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.329
<i>Unfortunately, I couldn't do it.</i>

12:51.839 --> 12:53.050
Oh, what'd I miss?

12:58.979 --> 13:03.277
<i>I felt bad about hurting Kim, so out of
compassion I pawned her off on my friends..</i>

13:03.411 --> 13:06.527
Fine, she can come with us,
but I'm not gonna be nice to her.

13:06.829 --> 13:09.411
Thanks. And listen, any time
you need a weekend to yourself

13:09.412 --> 13:12.188
and you want me to take that annoying
husband off your hands, just let me know.

13:12.325 --> 13:13.139
Done!

13:13.239 --> 13:15.194
<i>Win-win.</i>

13:15.195 --> 13:16.668
So where are you guys gonna go?

13:16.847 --> 13:19.111
We're gonna go look at bridesmaid
dresses to see what Carla thinks.

13:19.211 --> 13:21.512
Oh, yeah, because my
opinion matters so much.

13:22.004 --> 13:24.532
- What the frick is with you?!
- Mrow!

13:24.533 --> 13:26.764
Are you really that immature?!

13:26.924 --> 13:27.441
Meow!

13:28.184 --> 13:30.143
I'm gonna go check on mr. Fulton's recovery.

13:30.305 --> 13:32.544
Oh, mr. Fulton didn't have the surgery.

13:32.761 --> 13:34.183
What?

13:35.108 --> 13:37.342
Damn it, Ted, I want a cat fight!

13:42.640 --> 13:43.784
That'll do.

13:46.781 --> 13:48.674
Hey, JD, check it out.

13:49.146 --> 13:50.638
Ugly Betty holding Izzie.

13:50.756 --> 13:53.194
I don't care about your
stupid photoshopping, Turk!

13:53.256 --> 13:56.110
Dude, what the hell?! That was real!
We saw her at Costco!

13:56.310 --> 13:59.080
Uh-uh! You apologize
to your friend right now.

13:59.348 --> 14:00.856
I'm sorry about your picture.

14:01.056 --> 14:03.199
Gym teacher bunny conscience?

14:03.310 --> 14:06.633
Yeah. What the hell, man?
Why didn't you operate on Mr. Fulton?

14:06.831 --> 14:10.349
Dude, I know the pain sucks,
but it's not gonna kill him.

14:10.350 --> 14:13.930
And vascular surgery is way
too risky for a guy that age.

14:14.095 --> 14:15.445
Wasn't too risky yesterday.

14:15.546 --> 14:18.191
Well, that was before
I found out he had a kid.

14:24.111 --> 14:28.248
I really want to thank you guys for bringing
me out. It's nice to get out of the house,

14:28.249 --> 14:29.759
even if you won't talk to me.

14:37.846 --> 14:40.026
- Actually, Kim...
- Yeah?

14:40.596 --> 14:44.509
Would you mind just trying on
this dress for my cousin Layla?

14:44.974 --> 14:46.277
Is she pregnant, too?

14:46.491 --> 14:48.106
Oh, no, just a fatty-fatty-fatty.

14:51.261 --> 14:53.075
"Can you try on this dress
for my cousin Layla?!"

14:53.276 --> 14:54.476
Ok, what is your problem?

14:54.628 --> 14:57.066
You totally took over
the bachelorette party!

14:57.302 --> 14:59.066
You're a crazy control freak!

14:59.067 --> 15:00.079
I am not!

15:00.278 --> 15:01.141
Really?

15:01.725 --> 15:05.333
Because even though I know you don't
want the bridesmaids to wear any jewellery,

15:05.627 --> 15:08.529
i thought I would wear this tiara.

15:08.666 --> 15:09.690
Is that all right with you?

15:10.214 --> 15:11.077
Of course it is.

15:11.195 --> 15:13.332
Good. Because I think...

15:13.803 --> 15:14.862
I said no bling!

15:15.203 --> 15:16.458
See, i told you!

15:16.879 --> 15:17.938
I'll pay for that.

15:23.311 --> 15:24.335
Kim, are you ok?

15:24.664 --> 15:26.170
What am I doing here?

15:26.959 --> 15:28.707
Everybody hates me!

15:29.586 --> 15:33.194
I can't get the zipper up on
your big fat cousin's dress.

15:33.272 --> 15:36.821
No wonder JD said what he said!

15:37.762 --> 15:38.703
What did he say?

15:39.524 --> 15:41.642
How coud you do that
to the mother of your child?

15:41.813 --> 15:44.490
Yeah, all Kim asked was if there was
a one in a million chance for the two of you,

15:44.500 --> 15:45.993
and you couldn't just
give her a little hope?

15:46.160 --> 15:47.227
Now you're on her side?!

15:47.461 --> 15:50.736
She's pregnant! You're supposed to tell
her what she wants to hear.

15:50.853 --> 15:52.598
Yeah, like rember
when Carla was pregnant?

15:52.599 --> 15:55.285
And we all told her how beautiful she was
even though she looked like George Lopez?

15:55.286 --> 15:56.840
It's the same thing. Right?

15:58.197 --> 16:01.059
Ok, my time-out is over,
now I'm really pissed at you.

16:03.530 --> 16:06.667
Well, well, well. I told you
they'd turn on you.

16:06.863 --> 16:07.942
That's just 2 people.

16:08.498 --> 16:09.400
Boys?

16:09.477 --> 16:11.719
- She's pregnant, man!
- That's uncool.

16:11.751 --> 16:13.154
How could you do such a thing?

16:13.940 --> 16:14.587
What'd he do?

16:17.619 --> 16:18.364
Hey, Turk!

16:18.536 --> 16:20.026
You might want to buckle up,

16:20.027 --> 16:22.085
because the Coxian Express...

16:22.416 --> 16:24.685
Coxian is not the adjective
version of your name,

16:24.690 --> 16:26.995
it's a clever combination
of Cox and Dorian.

16:27.097 --> 16:27.685
Oh.

16:28.081 --> 16:32.412
Anyway, the afore mentioned express, is about
to drop some knowledge on your brown ass.

16:32.413 --> 16:36.851
You can't change who you are as a doctor
just because you're a dad. Tell him, Per.

16:36.859 --> 16:39.907
Of course being a father
changes who you are as a doctor.

16:39.908 --> 16:42.144
For God's sake, it changes
everything about you.

16:42.177 --> 16:43.841
Why did you come here if you're
just going to contradict me?

16:44.387 --> 16:47.848
I don't know. Intentionally
annoying you seems pretty Coxian.

16:47.949 --> 16:49.894
That is the adjective version.

16:50.131 --> 16:52.493
Now, if you'll excuse me
I'm going to step over there

16:52.542 --> 16:54.876
so that we can present
a united front against you.

16:57.675 --> 17:02.714
Listen, noobie, having a kid changes
the way you think about everything.

17:02.754 --> 17:04.005
Hell, yeah, it does.

17:04.625 --> 17:08.153
Before Izzie was born if I saw
a half-eaten meatball sub in the trash

17:08.154 --> 17:11.934
you better believe I would dust that
bad boy off and go to town on it!

17:12.044 --> 17:12.881
But now...

17:13.675 --> 17:16.080
I'm not riskin' my health eatin' trash food.

17:17.118 --> 17:18.766
I mean, unless it's a corndog.

17:20.376 --> 17:21.692
Thank God you procreated.

17:22.214 --> 17:23.722
Noobie, the point is,

17:24.123 --> 17:25.955
when that kid comes, you...

17:27.236 --> 17:29.982
You'll start seeing the world
a whole lot differently.

17:30.218 --> 17:31.529
You develop patience.

17:31.565 --> 17:33.234
You learn to forgive easier.

17:33.430 --> 17:35.273
If you got baby poop on your thumb,

17:35.469 --> 17:37.837
it's no big deal, you can just
rub it off on your jeans like that.

17:38.332 --> 17:40.097
I've seen the Wiggles live in concert!

17:41.865 --> 17:42.475
Twice.

17:43.189 --> 17:44.542
Did they perform Big Red Car?

17:44.640 --> 17:46.390
They opened and closed the show with it.

17:46.476 --> 17:48.005
It... was awesome.

17:54.401 --> 17:56.518
Carla, we need to talk.

17:56.580 --> 17:57.423
Mrow!

17:57.424 --> 17:59.109
No, sir, not "mrow!"

18:02.044 --> 18:05.416
Look, I know that I'm a control freak,
but it's just my nature.

18:05.809 --> 18:09.028
For example, you've got one maverick hair
sticking out of that right eyebrow

18:09.029 --> 18:10.222
that is driving me crazy

18:10.223 --> 18:13.006
and I want nothin' morethan to pin you
down and to pluck the hell out of it.

18:13.141 --> 18:14.209
But of course I won't.

18:14.905 --> 18:15.866
Unless you want me to.

18:17.219 --> 18:17.905
Never mind.

18:19.556 --> 18:21.086
What I really wanted to say is that...

18:22.122 --> 18:24.671
You're my best friend and I'm sorry.

18:26.344 --> 18:26.918
Good.

18:27.143 --> 18:28.339
'cause the party's still on.

18:28.711 --> 18:29.819
But on one condition...

18:30.574 --> 18:34.182
You gotta go the next 20 minutes without
asking any questions about what we're doing.

18:34.535 --> 18:35.319
I can do that.

18:38.933 --> 18:41.208
Wow, this is so cool!

18:43.098 --> 18:45.382
And, time!
That's 20 minutes.

18:45.383 --> 18:47.243
What are we doing? Where's everyone?
This feels all wrong.

18:47.244 --> 18:49.609
Elliot, relax. This is your night.

18:49.610 --> 18:51.465
You get to make all the decisions.

18:51.712 --> 18:53.793
Now, all your friends are standing by.

18:54.316 --> 18:58.043
I made reservations at 4 different restaurants.
I booked a paintball field,

18:58.102 --> 19:02.086
4 leads at the bowling alley and I made
reservations at various gay dance clubs.

19:02.087 --> 19:04.680
You get to pick what we'll do,
what we'll talk about,

19:04.699 --> 19:07.138
and at the end, Keith will show
up to carry you out the door,

19:07.349 --> 19:10.173
reminding the rest of us that
you are the one that's getting married.

19:10.251 --> 19:12.241
And what if I don't like the outfit
that some of the girls are wearing?

19:12.242 --> 19:14.732
Everyone's been told that
they have to bring a bag of outfits.

19:14.782 --> 19:15.937
Is Ronni Ippolito coming?

19:15.947 --> 19:19.156
Ronni is waiting at the next corner,
and she has no idea why.

19:19.623 --> 19:22.702
If you want, we can pick her up.
If not, we can fly right by.

19:23.042 --> 19:25.476
Carla, you're the most
amazing friend ever!

19:25.847 --> 19:26.376
Duck!

19:32.637 --> 19:33.985
I love you.

19:34.147 --> 19:35.284
I love you, too.

19:38.383 --> 19:40.343
- Oh, my god!
- Oh, my god!

19:41.720 --> 19:45.925
We're getting married! We're getting married!
Elliot's getting married!

19:45.926 --> 19:48.039
<i>I was glad I was late
and that Kim was asleep.</i>

19:48.049 --> 19:51.054
<i>It gave me time to think
about what Turk and dr. Cox said</i>

19:51.055 --> 19:53.040
<i> about fatherhood changing you.</i>

19:53.615 --> 19:56.211
Here's Jack right after
he's feeding some ducks.

19:57.084 --> 19:58.594
Izzie driving a tonka truck.

19:59.280 --> 20:02.162
<i>And how Elliot was getting married
and moving on with her life.</i>

20:04.045 --> 20:05.849
Did she try to control everything?

20:06.327 --> 20:07.307
She wasn't so bad.

20:08.649 --> 20:11.257
Other shoulder, Keith!
It's more comfortable.

20:14.280 --> 20:16.287
<i>But mostly I thought
about how much it sucked</i>

20:16.288 --> 20:18.339
<i>that my parents were
divorced when I was a kid.</i>

20:19.401 --> 20:21.168
Right here.
I'm just checking.

20:21.169 --> 20:23.677
<i>And how much easier life would be for my son</i>

20:23.678 --> 20:24.811
<i>if Kim and I were together.</i>

20:24.812 --> 20:27.099
Sam just told me he's
very ticklish right here.

20:27.100 --> 20:28.231
Right there?!

20:32.750 --> 20:34.378
<i>It wasn't just about me anymore.</i>

20:35.429 --> 20:36.757
<i>I had to give us a shot.</i>

20:38.885 --> 20:39.488
Hey.

20:40.569 --> 20:41.071
Hey.

20:41.453 --> 20:43.464
<i>Even if it was only one in a million.</i>

20:45.000 --> 20:51.074

20:54.292 --> 20:56.762
<i>It felt good to be holding
the mother of my child.</i>

20:57.340 --> 20:58.312
This is nice.

20:58.717 --> 21:02.197
<i>But given recent events
cuddling was as far as I was gonna go</i>

21:02.357 --> 21:04.134
<i>Kim and I had to get
to know each other again</i>

21:04.135 --> 21:08.224
<i>and build trust, and... Oh,
my god, is that side boob?</i>

21:08.225 --> 21:10.339
Whoa, careful with the side boob, big guy.

21:10.407 --> 21:11.973
My hormones are going crazy.

21:11.983 --> 21:13.708
I might just pounce your skinny ass.

21:13.718 --> 21:15.410
Kim, I really don't think we should.

21:15.631 --> 21:16.443
I won't.

21:17.489 --> 21:19.381
I got a giant boogie in my nose.

21:19.391 --> 21:21.137
<i>Look at her saying "I won't"</i>

21:21.138 --> 21:23.142
<i>with a giant boogie in her nose.</i>

21:23.363 --> 21:24.375
<i>I must have her!</i>

21:24.376 --> 21:25.539
You know what? On second thought...

21:25.662 --> 21:26.142
Yes?

21:26.375 --> 21:27.863
<i>Still, I wonder what it'll be like</i>

21:27.864 --> 21:29.424
<i>having sex with a pregnant woman.</i>

21:30.536 --> 21:32.828
That was so cool... And weird.

21:33.248 --> 21:35.252
Yeah, somebody else liked it, too.

21:35.639 --> 21:36.974
He's going crazy in there.

21:37.232 --> 21:38.634
And now it's disgusting.

21:40.396 --> 21:42.168
<i>The next 3 weeks flew by.</i>

21:42.769 --> 21:44.478
<i>We stayed up nights talking.</i>

21:46.506 --> 21:48.222
<i>We got the place ready for a baby.</i>

21:52.428 --> 21:54.807
<i>And before you knew it,
we were a couple again.</i>

21:54.865 --> 21:55.697
Bye.

21:56.981 --> 21:58.198
Bye, Sammy.

22:02.305 --> 22:05.428
<i>Now that Elliot's wedding was only
a week away, things were getting tense.</i>

22:05.538 --> 22:08.157
I just don't understand why our
families can't sit at the same table.

22:08.231 --> 22:11.006
Keith, it's impossible to fit all the
Dudemeister at one table without

22:11.007 --> 22:12.556
our wedding looking like Oktoberfest.

22:12.709 --> 22:14.540
Plus, when our families met last month,

22:14.541 --> 22:16.643
my mum ended up bonking
your uncle Roland in our basement.

22:16.815 --> 22:19.249
Uncle Ronald and aunt Alicia
have been together for 30 years!

22:19.250 --> 22:21.306
Yeah, welcome to my family, Keith.

22:21.523 --> 22:21.965
Look...

22:22.850 --> 22:25.315
I know that I'm being a bridezilla,
so to make it up to you,

22:25.316 --> 22:27.025
here's a kiss with extra tongue.

22:34.805 --> 22:36.919
Ok, now go try on that tux
that I picked up for you.

22:37.469 --> 22:38.087
Chop, chop!

22:38.088 --> 22:39.129
Quick like a bunny!

22:40.115 --> 22:41.089
Hey, and you!

22:41.265 --> 22:43.191
You are the only one who hasn't
R.S.V.P'ed to my wedding yet.

22:43.192 --> 22:43.794
What the hell?

22:44.313 --> 22:45.426
I didn't know I was invited.

22:45.799 --> 22:47.284
But I sent your invitation to...

22:48.487 --> 22:50.206
One North Cemetery Drive.

22:50.577 --> 22:52.645
That's the address
of the Addams family.

22:53.081 --> 22:54.903
- Oh.
- I changed my records to mess with Kelso,

22:54.904 --> 22:56.340
'cause he's always calling me Lurch.

22:56.550 --> 22:58.931
It was either that or 1313 Mockingbird Lane.

23:00.468 --> 23:02.091
The Monsters?
Tv show?

23:02.496 --> 23:02.927
I'm old.

23:04.283 --> 23:05.183
So can you make it?

23:05.785 --> 23:07.651
Are you crazy? I wouldn't
miss it for the world.

23:08.278 --> 23:09.288
Thank you!

23:09.823 --> 23:11.456
Not a big hugger,
but...

23:11.928 --> 23:12.790
There we go.

23:13.059 --> 23:13.514
There it is.

23:13.625 --> 23:15.493
<i>Things weren't
as heartwarming everywhere.</i>

23:15.494 --> 23:17.830
<i>Dr. Cox wasn't exactly super-psyched</i>

23:17.840 --> 23:19.401
<i>about me being his daughter's godfather.</i>

23:19.402 --> 23:21.836
Jordan, here some things I rather see happen

23:21.837 --> 23:24.371
than Dinkus over there becoming the godfather.

23:24.751 --> 23:27.382
A nuclear war, a sequel to Hope Floats,

23:27.432 --> 23:29.210
Hugh Jackman winning an oscar...

23:29.220 --> 23:31.719
Yeah, yeah, funny, long list. We get it.

23:32.580 --> 23:34.752
- You need a new thing, big guy.
- Huh.

23:35.580 --> 23:36.452
Sweetie!

23:36.482 --> 23:38.416
Why would i get rid of him as godfather

23:38.417 --> 23:41.184
when you keep letting me know
how much it bothers you?

23:41.194 --> 23:42.717
It's like he's never met you.

23:42.776 --> 23:44.587
- Right?
- And I love Hope Floats.

23:45.445 --> 23:47.633
Anyone that's going
to the christening...

23:48.530 --> 23:49.637
Not you.

23:52.490 --> 23:53.965
It's at the hospital chapel.

23:54.209 --> 23:56.679
<i>And then Jordan pushed dr. Cox over the edge</i>

23:56.680 --> 23:59.370
<i>by calling their daughter,
little Jennifer Dylan, this.</i>

23:59.901 --> 24:01.155
Ok, come on, JD.

24:04.699 --> 24:06.312
- Dr. Cox...
- Leave.

24:07.048 --> 24:07.577
Yes.

24:08.105 --> 24:09.507
That goes for everyone.

24:15.324 --> 24:16.524
All living things.

24:22.332 --> 24:24.140
<i>This might not blow over.</i>

24:25.750 --> 24:27.702
Ooh, I gotta hurt someone.

24:27.971 --> 24:30.606
<i>It's amazing
how some couples are so close</i>

24:30.607 --> 24:32.591
<i>that they can finish each other sentences.</i>

24:32.715 --> 24:36.028
So there we were,
hottest day of the year,

24:36.274 --> 24:39.344
at the beach, and we're both wearing jeans!

24:39.345 --> 24:40.282
Isn't that crazy?

24:40.819 --> 24:43.379
- Guess who we run into...
- Also in jeans.

24:43.533 --> 24:45.330
It was dr. J, Kim!

24:45.331 --> 24:47.593
And unless you wanna
hear this for the next hour

24:47.594 --> 24:49.524
please change the subject.

24:49.745 --> 24:51.025
Ok, uh...

24:51.388 --> 24:53.720
My lease is up on my
apartment in Washington,

24:53.919 --> 24:57.618
my ob said that my mucus plug is holding firm.

24:57.619 --> 24:59.669
And that's, uh, all I've got.

24:59.980 --> 25:01.921
Ugh. Why don't you just
give up that apartment?

25:01.922 --> 25:03.138
You said it's so small.

25:03.451 --> 25:06.210
Plus, I think it'd be fun if the baby
was around here for a few months.

25:06.948 --> 25:08.012
Ok, i'll give it up.

25:08.022 --> 25:10.375
Incidentally, that's not the
first time she's said that today,

25:10.376 --> 25:11.671
- if you know what I'm talking about.
- Mm-mmh.

25:11.925 --> 25:13.218
I know what you're
talking about.

25:13.228 --> 25:14.720
I hit it, and I hit it good.

25:14.755 --> 25:16.089
- Yes, you did.
- Rowdy style.

25:16.099 --> 25:18.092
We have to look out for
that belly, it's dangerous!

25:18.102 --> 25:21.564
Listen, I have a video that you might
be a little interested in watching.

25:21.710 --> 25:24.166
- Are you sure?
- Welcome to my world.

25:30.506 --> 25:32.807
Babe, I like this tuxedo more than
the one you picked out.

25:33.436 --> 25:35.251
Yeah, it looks really great, Keith.

25:35.657 --> 25:38.998
You know, if you plan on sawing me in half
at the altar and yelling "abracadabra!"

25:39.099 --> 25:40.499
But it's comfortable.

25:40.550 --> 25:42.343
You think that I'm gonna be comfortable

25:42.353 --> 25:44.953
in my 5 inch heels and my rib-crushing
corset and my nipple tape?

25:45.951 --> 25:47.951
There will be no poppers
in my wedding photos, Keith.

25:48.828 --> 25:51.452
Look, you have to remember
this is probably the only time

25:51.462 --> 25:53.221
that all of our closest
friends and our family

25:53.231 --> 25:54.955
are going to be all
together in the same room.

25:55.904 --> 25:57.979
So this wedding really isn't about us, ok?

25:58.565 --> 26:00.165
- Ok.
- It's about me!

26:00.168 --> 26:01.566
Now come on, focus!

26:01.641 --> 26:03.256
There's no "you"
in "wedding," huh?

26:05.932 --> 26:08.523
This is Mr. Cole. He's in a
persistent vegetative state

26:08.524 --> 26:10.637
and was admitted with
community-acquired pneumonia.

26:11.012 --> 26:12.767
It's most likely
related to aspiration,

26:12.768 --> 26:14.750
given his prior phrenic nerve paralysis.

26:17.659 --> 26:18.834
His doctor's creepy.

26:18.835 --> 26:20.122
- That's his wife.
- Oh, right, right.

26:21.473 --> 26:23.219
Men, I've gathered the brain trust

26:23.220 --> 26:26.494
because I have been invited
to Blond Doctor's wedding.

26:27.499 --> 26:30.074
Now, none of you guys should feel bad
because you weren't invited,

26:30.075 --> 26:31.473
it doesn't mean
she doesn't like you.

26:31.474 --> 26:34.205
It just means that you're not
one of her favorite 385 people.

26:34.752 --> 26:37.241
- I couldn't make it anyway.
- They gotta have a cut off somewhere.

26:37.596 --> 26:40.930
Now, what I need from you is gift ideas.
Impress me.

26:41.155 --> 26:43.765
You could check their registry
and get her some nice linens.

26:43.950 --> 26:47.315
Or I could check the boring
and get her some boring boring.

26:47.756 --> 26:48.695
What the hell does that mean?

26:49.221 --> 26:52.890
Oh! You know what I got my mom
that she really loved?

26:53.027 --> 26:58.929
That weird birth control thing
that they sew under your arm skin!

26:59.164 --> 27:02.046
Ok, highly disturbing, but
you're thinking outside the box.

27:02.234 --> 27:03.379
Oh, yeah.

27:03.840 --> 27:08.337
What's goin' on, guys? I didn't get beeped
on my special brain trust pager.

27:08.572 --> 27:12.694
This is awkward. Look, uh, Doug, I'm only
comfortable with a 3-man brain trust,

27:12.814 --> 27:14.708
and right now, I'm giving
Lloyd here a tryout.

27:15.443 --> 27:16.628
I'm gonna have to ask for the pager back.

27:18.181 --> 27:19.281
Thanks, kid.

27:20.551 --> 27:21.812
You can still come to the picnic.

27:23.286 --> 27:25.453
Here you go, Lloyd. Here's your pager.

27:26.489 --> 27:28.582
- Your idea?
- There's this amazing house

27:28.583 --> 27:31.550
on my delivery route, with all kinds of
valuable stuff and no alarm.

27:32.038 --> 27:34.348
- We could rob it.
- I'm gonna need that back.

27:35.111 --> 27:36.357
Hold onto this for a little while.

27:38.202 --> 27:40.127
So, it turns out my hospital in Tacoma

27:40.145 --> 27:42.756
won't grant me more than
a 6-week leave of absence.

27:43.108 --> 27:44.686
Just look for a job here.

27:44.792 --> 27:46.542
I'd love to have my kid
in the same city.

27:46.652 --> 27:50.048
Plus, Kelso hates the urologist
he hired to replace you.

27:50.315 --> 27:50.915
<i>Are you sure?</i>

27:51.218 --> 27:53.718
Hey, I love being the new urologist here.

27:53.753 --> 27:56.420
But I'm having some trouble with my peers.

27:56.821 --> 27:58.754
Get it? Pee-ers?

27:59.555 --> 28:00.703
God, I hate you.

28:01.456 --> 28:02.303
I'm pretty sure.

28:02.926 --> 28:04.121
All right, I'll check it out.

28:05.653 --> 28:06.855
Rog, rerun.

28:07.393 --> 28:12.076
Ok, Tina, here's what I'm prepared to offer
you to relinquish the post of godfather.

28:12.654 --> 28:13.434
Not interested.

28:13.535 --> 28:16.035
Effective immediately I will
stop calling you girl's names.

28:16.972 --> 28:18.372
Interested now?

28:18.440 --> 28:19.840
I'm still here, aren't I?

28:20.750 --> 28:23.578
- Be strong. You can get more.
- Good thinking.

28:23.688 --> 28:24.912
What else you got, Per-Per?

28:25.049 --> 28:28.049
I'll give you my real pager number.

28:28.116 --> 28:29.716
I'll be able to page him 24/7!

28:29.826 --> 28:31.084
- No deal.
- What are you doing?!

28:32.155 --> 28:33.088
Put a cherry on top.

28:34.091 --> 28:34.957
One hug.

28:35.994 --> 28:36.694
Per week.

28:36.760 --> 28:38.260
- Decade.
- Month.

28:38.612 --> 28:40.753
- Year.
- Done. You're welcome.

28:43.042 --> 28:46.067
<i>And then, as I was about
to close the deal of the century...</i>

28:46.423 --> 28:47.269
<i>It hit me...</i>

28:47.940 --> 28:51.204
Wait a minute, if I agree to that,
I only get that stuff until you retire.

28:51.607 --> 28:53.945
But if I'm godfather,
I'm in your life forever.

28:54.548 --> 28:55.984
I'll see you at the christening.

28:57.581 --> 28:59.345
I think this time I'm
actually gonna kill him.

29:00.650 --> 29:01.283
Yep.

29:02.021 --> 29:02.593
It's the one.

29:04.964 --> 29:09.448
Babe, should the valets at our reception
wear green or red vests?

29:09.600 --> 29:11.359
Doesn't matter. Why
didn't you just pick one?

29:11.469 --> 29:15.092
Because I want every detail of our wedding
to be exactly the way you want it.

29:16.237 --> 29:18.960
I've never loved you more
than I do at this moment.

29:19.654 --> 29:20.809
And I want them to wear green.

29:20.856 --> 29:22.908
- Forest, not lime.
- Got it.

29:26.111 --> 29:27.898
How did you get him to be like that?

29:28.612 --> 29:31.842
Did you do that thing all guys want us
to do but we swore we'd never do?

29:32.396 --> 29:33.818
I didn't have to.
He just loves me.

29:34.552 --> 29:35.385
Why, did you?

29:35.624 --> 29:37.924
I'm saving that bullet
for a diamond tennis bracelet.

29:40.634 --> 29:44.499
By the way, Frank's breathing was
labored, so i suctioned his airway.

29:44.999 --> 29:49.044
Mrs. Cole, I have to say I am blown away
by how you're taking care of your husband.

29:49.495 --> 29:50.960
Especially till 2 years.

29:51.495 --> 29:53.758
Isn't it hard to make
yourself do it every day?

29:54.556 --> 29:55.458
No.

29:56.176 --> 29:58.776
We were married 19 years before his accident.

29:59.177 --> 30:00.243
You're getting married.

30:01.181 --> 30:02.847
You understand that kind of love.

30:05.062 --> 30:07.438
Sorry. My husband has a little eye-gunk.

30:15.764 --> 30:18.633
Ok, I've got something we can't
give her permanently,

30:18.894 --> 30:22.058
but I can guarantee she'll enjoy it
while she has her hands on it.

30:22.206 --> 30:24.839
No! Preemptive strike on the sex joke.

30:24.975 --> 30:25.805
Take a time-out.

30:27.818 --> 30:30.613
What about a nice tour
in the wine country?

30:30.679 --> 30:32.746
Come on, Doug, now you're just
embarrassing yourself.

30:33.037 --> 30:34.548
I still don't know what I did.

30:34.577 --> 30:37.093
You're old news, bro. Just go.

30:39.591 --> 30:41.458
Ok, maybe I didn't make myself clear.

30:41.919 --> 30:44.893
I don't wanna give Blond Doctor
just a thing, you know?

30:45.006 --> 30:48.295
I wanted her married life to be full of joy.
I want to give her happiness.

30:48.905 --> 30:50.869
Well, that's not really up to us.

30:52.204 --> 30:53.504
It's up to him.

30:54.811 --> 30:59.008
We can't control what kind
of husband he'll be.

30:59.643 --> 31:01.076
Lloyd, give me those glasses.

31:02.277 --> 31:04.477
Say that again.
Exactly the same way.

31:04.980 --> 31:09.514
We can't control what kind
of husband he'll be.

31:10.816 --> 31:11.585
Or can we?

31:13.252 --> 31:13.985
Dorian?

31:15.085 --> 31:17.654
Tell your baby mama
that she can have her job back.

31:18.047 --> 31:21.690
By the way, I think it's hilarious
that you trust her again.

31:22.090 --> 31:23.388
I know, sir. I got your email.

31:24.626 --> 31:29.923
Well, I'm off to my thinking spot to put
the finishing touches on my goddad speech.

31:30.264 --> 31:33.698
A word of advice...
Bring your hankies.

31:34.771 --> 31:36.671
You can't do this to me.

31:37.007 --> 31:39.774
Perry, I... I didn't do this to torture you.

31:39.847 --> 31:43.509
I asked Nancy No-chin to be
the godfather because I know

31:43.510 --> 31:45.294
deep down you really care about him.

31:45.482 --> 31:49.960
And you know that he would be an
excellent godfather for our little girl.

31:50.261 --> 31:51.988
- I'll do anything.
- Here's what I want.

31:52.098 --> 31:54.673
When I buy matching outfits for you
and Jack, you have to wear them.

31:55.002 --> 31:57.198
And I get to go on one movieday

31:57.199 --> 31:59.462
with that maitre dee at that new
Italian restaurant we go to.

31:59.575 --> 32:02.158
And no asking what happened after I go.

32:02.439 --> 32:03.707
- Done. May I go now?
- Yeah.

32:04.843 --> 32:07.379
<i>Let's see,
what rhymes with baptism?</i>

32:08.113 --> 32:11.364
<i>Faptism, raptism, naptism.</i>

32:11.693 --> 32:13.426
<i>I'm so tired. I could use a naptism.</i>

32:14.473 --> 32:16.391
<i>And there is my opening joke.</i>

32:16.590 --> 32:19.709
<i>I should write down "Pause for
laughs", so I don't forget to.</i>

32:20.310 --> 32:22.210
You! You're out as Godfather!

32:23.507 --> 32:25.193
How did he find my thinking spot?

32:27.162 --> 32:30.130
I can't believe who they picked
to be the new Godfather!

32:30.904 --> 32:33.836
Look at him over there,
all smug and cocky!

32:35.670 --> 32:36.784
Doodie!

32:36.972 --> 32:38.251
Doodie to you, sir.

32:39.905 --> 32:41.559
Is that blood on your scrubs?

32:41.664 --> 32:43.342
Yeah, just got out of surgery!

32:43.913 --> 32:46.705
What, you gonna get all up in Jesus's face
because he don't have his shirt on?

32:47.256 --> 32:50.165
Perry? We forgot
to pick out the Godmother.

32:52.952 --> 32:54.688
Who...

32:54.806 --> 32:56.037
wants to be the Godmother?

32:57.328 --> 32:58.688
Put your hand out.

32:58.794 --> 33:00.600
Carla? Do the honors.

33:01.277 --> 33:02.368
Yes.

33:02.415 --> 33:04.116
- Oh, that's bullsh--
- Ssshhh!

33:04.714 --> 33:06.075
- Rabbi?
- Father.

33:06.134 --> 33:07.483
Don't care. Hit it!

33:07.749 --> 33:10.705
Whether we think of baptism,
we think of commitment.

33:11.081 --> 33:14.506
For when a couple decide
to bring a child into the world...

33:14.887 --> 33:16.353
or share their lives together...

33:16.584 --> 33:19.048
<i>It's amazing how quickly panic can set in.</i>

33:19.095 --> 33:21.757
<i>Like panic over whether or not
you love your fiance enough.</i>

33:22.015 --> 33:24.749
I've got some gunk in my eye.
Can you get it out for me?

33:25.348 --> 33:25.615
Uhm...

33:26.399 --> 33:29.226
<i>Or panic over suddenly
finding yourself in too deep.</i>

33:29.730 --> 33:30.844
Look at them!

33:30.997 --> 33:32.616
Mum, Dad and baby!

33:32.882 --> 33:34.477
That's gonna be us.

33:42.990 --> 33:47.037
Look, Jen, if you need any legal help
concerning your accident you can talk to Jim.

33:47.319 --> 33:49.911
who's a very successful,
esteemed bulldog of a lawyer.

33:49.993 --> 33:52.912
Or you can talk to Ted, who... well...

33:53.544 --> 33:55.292
My mum calls me thunder.

33:56.206 --> 33:58.283
I'll go with the less shiny one.

33:58.623 --> 33:59.702
Tough break, thunder.

34:00.043 --> 34:03.398
You're not my Mum, Jim.
You're not my Mum.

34:04.758 --> 34:09.826
Sorry, Kim, I know I said I'd come straight
home but I got stopped covering a shift.

34:10.021 --> 34:11.699
Well, no problem. I'll wait up for you.

34:11.828 --> 34:14.455
Do you know that half glass of wine
my doctor said I'm allowed every night?

34:14.851 --> 34:17.043
I'm gonna hold off until you get here,

34:17.091 --> 34:19.426
because it makes me super randy.

34:19.844 --> 34:20.864
Can't wait.

34:20.922 --> 34:24.431
<i>I really didn't have to cover that shift,
but I just needed some time alone.</i>

34:27.899 --> 34:28.873
What are you doing here?

34:29.244 --> 34:31.708
Hiding from my significant other
due to a massive panic attack

34:31.726 --> 34:33.699
over the life-altering commitment
I'm about to make.

34:34.188 --> 34:35.197
You?

34:35.233 --> 34:36.241
Same.

34:36.389 --> 34:38.619
I told Keith that I was working
tonight here and he went home.

34:40.284 --> 34:41.364
Good night.

34:46.514 --> 34:48.567
Actually, your night has just begun.

34:49.739 --> 34:51.840
I'm getting married in a week, a week.

34:51.887 --> 34:54.080
I mean, what was I thinking being
engaged for two months?

34:54.139 --> 34:56.331
My Mum was engaged
for three years. She had time...

34:56.411 --> 34:58.864
to soul search, to figure out
if this was right.

34:58.911 --> 35:02.055
To sail around the world with
an insatiable Pakistani oil baron.

35:02.239 --> 35:03.388
Why was I in such a hurry?

35:03.482 --> 35:07.095
Oh, wait, I'll answer for you. Because I'm
the biggest idiot in the whole entire world?

35:07.631 --> 35:09.238
Really, Elliot? The biggest?

35:09.391 --> 35:12.300
Because few weeks ago I got back
together with the woman who lied to me,

35:12.327 --> 35:14.118
about being pregnant with my child.

35:14.363 --> 35:18.434
You should also know that even though I
promised myself that I was gonna take it slow

35:18.492 --> 35:20.381
I convinced her to
give up her appartment,

35:20.493 --> 35:23.472
quit her job, move in with me,
and start working here.

35:23.621 --> 35:24.630
Why?

35:24.701 --> 35:27.187
I don't know. I'm just realizing
right now that I did all of that.

35:27.281 --> 35:30.331
I just wish there was a test I could take
to tell me if I'm doing the right thing.

35:30.398 --> 35:31.547
I mean, look at Turk and Carla.

35:31.594 --> 35:34.574
They are so meant to be together. You spend
one minute with them and you know that.

35:34.632 --> 35:36.533
They just have this
amazing give and take.

35:36.845 --> 35:39.508
Don't you love this tennis bracelet?

35:41.092 --> 35:42.652
That was awesome!

35:43.758 --> 35:47.406
I'm going through the same things you are,
except I'm also having a baby.

35:47.547 --> 35:51.102
So imagine your situation multiplied by...
what's a fair number?

35:51.172 --> 35:52.498
A hundred billion?

35:52.674 --> 35:55.794
Why it is so important to you that
your freak-out is better than mine?

35:56.040 --> 35:58.620
I'm a story topper, Elliot,
you know that about me.

35:58.961 --> 36:01.717
When I was a kid I had a friend
like that, he drove me crazy.

36:01.811 --> 36:04.650
When I was a kid I also had a friend
like that except he snapped

36:04.706 --> 36:07.451
and start playing hide the peanut
butter with my dog whiskers.

36:07.639 --> 36:09.738
You, my friend, have just
been story topped.

36:09.844 --> 36:10.853
I will kill you.

36:11.447 --> 36:14.755
How am I supposed to handle
a relationship and a kid at the same time?

36:15.482 --> 36:18.649
I don't know. Dr. Cox and Jordan are totally
dysfunctional but they seem to make it work.

36:19.232 --> 36:22.434
Wow! You guys look great!

36:24.347 --> 36:25.989
I'm gonna get the photographer.

36:28.121 --> 36:29.552
Jordan, I hate this.

36:29.595 --> 36:30.639
Why?

36:30.686 --> 36:34.792
I would think an arrogant ass like you
would love having his very own clone.

36:35.140 --> 36:38.741
- Up yours, Bobo.
- Yeah, up yours Bobo.

36:40.818 --> 36:42.566
Outstanding. Come.

36:46.320 --> 36:49.900
Ok, incredibly handsome guy,
you are about to marry Blond doctor.

36:50.009 --> 36:53.657
My gift to her is to train you
to be a good husband.

36:54.152 --> 36:55.853
Well,... I think I'm ok.

36:56.087 --> 36:58.732
Really? would you know what to do
if she suddenly woke up

37:01.085 --> 37:02.492
That's ridiculous.

37:02.553 --> 37:03.573
It's that what you gonna say?

37:03.620 --> 37:06.271
When she looks at you with those
big blue eyes and cries out:

37:06.377 --> 37:09.157
l-m-t-k-p-k-l-t-s

37:11.042 --> 37:14.420
Look, if I learned one thing
from my parents is this:

37:14.473 --> 37:19.329
The key to a good marriage is
keeping your emotions bottled up

37:19.583 --> 37:22.551
until they finally explode and
you have to lash out physically.

37:23.055 --> 37:26.608
- D'you mean... beat each other up?
- I mean beat yourself up.

37:27.437 --> 37:31.249
My mother once snapped her own index finger
because my father was late for church.

37:31.953 --> 37:33.912
She turned at the car
he threw himself down the stairs.

37:35.499 --> 37:36.508
Boys, anything?

37:36.871 --> 37:40.731
Whatever you do, don't go bald.

37:41.106 --> 37:42.115
Lloyd, anything?

37:42.185 --> 37:44.789
Yeah, I'm still not sure who Elliot is.

37:45.376 --> 37:48.015
Oh, come on! This guy sucks.

37:52.936 --> 37:54.696
The thing that freaked me out
was watching this woman

37:54.743 --> 37:56.866
wipe eye gunk off
her brain-dead husband.

37:57.020 --> 38:00.527
I mean, I don't think I can't spend 2 years
wiping eye gunk off Keith's brain dead face.

38:00.915 --> 38:04.505
Elliot, they were married for like
20 years before that guy was on a coma.

38:04.962 --> 38:06.886
I'm sure once you and Keith
had that much time together

38:06.907 --> 38:07.858
you'll feel differently.

38:09.214 --> 38:11.619
Still, maybe we are freaking out
about nothing, you know?

38:12.378 --> 38:14.091
Maybe we are with the right people.

38:14.900 --> 38:15.909
Really?

38:15.979 --> 38:17.903
I don't know. Last night
Kim and I had a moment

38:17.950 --> 38:19.721
that made me think we are
perfect for each other.

38:21.235 --> 38:25.013
Argh, this salad has beets.
Do you like beets?

38:25.042 --> 38:27.422
- I hate beets.
- Me too!

38:27.423 --> 38:28.852
We're both
beet-haters.

38:29.602 --> 38:31.701
- You know, people is all passionate
about beets. - JD?

38:32.283 --> 38:33.750
JD!

38:34.187 --> 38:37.624
A mutual hatred of beets is not
enough to base a relationship on.

38:37.788 --> 38:40.662
I know, Elliot but you
interrupted my flash back.

38:41.015 --> 38:45.250
After the beets conversation I confided
in Kim that I was really scared about...

38:45.426 --> 38:47.631
being a doctor and being
a dad at the same time

38:47.680 --> 38:51.175
because both of those things require
the throw of all of yourself into them.

38:51.594 --> 38:55.829
And she was amazing, she really...calmed me
down and made me feel good about it.

38:57.321 --> 38:58.102
Oh.

38:58.411 --> 39:00.452
<i>Plus we both really hate beets.</i>

39:00.745 --> 39:02.458
You know, Keith is pretty incredible?

39:03.619 --> 39:05.695
I've never felt this love in my entire life.

39:06.994 --> 39:08.933
Let's face it.. Keith would
walk through fire for me.

39:09.316 --> 39:12.284
Yeah, I'm not walking through
fire to prove my love to Elliot.

39:12.636 --> 39:14.055
I find that a little suspect.

39:14.935 --> 39:17.867
Still, I suppose we could
switch to some role playing.

39:17.949 --> 39:21.528
Here is the scenario. You have
just come home from work late,

39:21.691 --> 39:24.889
Blond doctor made you dinner and she's
angry because you didn't call ahead.

39:25.010 --> 39:27.298
Plus you've brought along with you, Lance,

39:27.353 --> 39:29.957
your gay ultimate freesbie
buddy, played by Todd.

39:30.579 --> 39:34.027
- I should probably take my pants off.
- Wait for your cue.

39:35.777 --> 39:39.367
And Ted, you'll be playing
Blond doctor. Get in the character.

39:40.610 --> 39:44.876
Ok, falling in love with you,
long blond hair...

39:45.099 --> 39:49.228
talking very fast, talking very fast,
frick, frick... ok, I'm ready.

39:51.094 --> 39:53.416
Good. Ok, ready and...

39:53.921 --> 39:54.930
Action!

39:57.217 --> 39:58.812
Todd, did you hear a cue?

39:58.883 --> 40:00.666
- It's just...
- That's it! Look...

40:01.185 --> 40:03.461
The only person I have
to prove my love to is Elliot.

40:03.543 --> 40:06.218
And I plan on doing that
every day for the rest of my life.

40:07.766 --> 40:09.221
I'm done here.

40:10.194 --> 40:13.111
- Shall we go and get him?
- No, haven't you heard what he just said?

40:13.498 --> 40:16.623
He's gonna be a great husband and you
know why? Because we got him there.

40:17.041 --> 40:18.718
We really got brain trust. Hands in.

40:20.838 --> 40:23.043
- Not you Lloyd. You're out.
- I figured.

40:23.161 --> 40:24.639
One, two, three... Braintrust!

40:28.397 --> 40:32.849
Why are you wearing scrubs? I haven't
seen you in those in like two years.

40:33.206 --> 40:35.200
I didn't wanna get my
christening dress wrinkly.

40:35.229 --> 40:36.614
That was the only thing
I had in my locker.

40:38.397 --> 40:39.898
I like you in the scrubs.

40:41.009 --> 40:42.933
It reminds me when we used to date.

40:43.250 --> 40:44.927
It was a disaster!

40:45.643 --> 40:47.707
- All of it?
- No!

40:50.073 --> 40:53.944
If anything, maybe we were perfect for
each other. We just had the same fatal flow.

40:54.679 --> 40:56.627
You mean that whenever we get
too close to a commitment

40:56.642 --> 40:58.550
we totally freak out and try to escape?

40:58.914 --> 41:00.498
That's what we've been
doing here all night, right?

41:00.787 --> 41:02.910
Besides I've thought about it
and there's no escape in this one.

41:02.969 --> 41:05.608
The gifts are all here.
People bought plane tickets.

41:07.204 --> 41:08.693
I'm getting married.

41:09.692 --> 41:13.168
- I've reached the point of no return.
- You and me both.

41:13.575 --> 41:18.804
I mean, to get out of this,
I'd have to do something huge.

41:19.131 --> 41:20.761
I'd have to go nuclear.

41:31.104 --> 41:32.347
<i>So there we were.</i>

41:35.303 --> 41:36.946
<i>Together...</i>

41:47.356 --> 41:49.128
<i>But not together.</i>

42:03.613 --> 42:04.862
<i>And as always...</i>

42:06.073 --> 42:08.747
<i>Not knowing what the hell we were doing.</i>

42:11.293 --> 42:12.005
Hey.

42:13.874 --> 42:14.639
Hey.
