<i>Double espresso straight out.</i>

00:09.589 --> 00:11.567
<i>Okay, where's my waitress?</i>

00:12.675 --> 00:14.540
Double cap, no foam...

00:15.203 --> 00:17.291
skim milk, light whip, and the

00:17.292 --> 00:19.715
double Americano, old school.
Who's next?

00:19.716 --> 00:21.196
- Oh, yes, $6.50, thank you.
- Okay,

00:23.677 --> 00:25.201
there's your change.

00:27.741 --> 00:28.411
All right,

00:29.516 --> 00:32.930
got your chocolate mint...
and yours. Thank you.

00:34.957 --> 00:37.725
Hi. You did not just do that.

00:40.524 --> 00:41.669
What can I get you?

00:42.544 --> 00:44.812
Uh, thanks, I've already
been helped.

00:44.974 --> 00:45.730
Great.

00:45.959 --> 00:46.773
Next?

00:46.851 --> 00:48.705
University of Miami?

00:48.706 --> 00:49.478
Yeah.

00:49.479 --> 00:54.397
I just don't see you trading
in your flannels for flip-flops.

00:54.398 --> 00:56.513
Well, I figure, if you've
got a chance to start over,

00:56.517 --> 00:58.308
why not start over
where there's a beach?

00:59.519 --> 01:01.191
I am feeling a bit
guilty leaving my

01:01.217 --> 01:02.817
parents to run the
farm without me.

01:02.818 --> 01:04.799
Yeah, I guess you would be
really hard to replace,

01:04.800 --> 01:06.995
with all your skills and everything.

01:06.996 --> 01:07.735
Skills?

01:07.736 --> 01:09.178
Um, Lois, hey,

01:09.227 --> 01:10.752
can I get a double cappuccino?

01:10.753 --> 01:11.912
Yeah, just a sec.

01:14.229 --> 01:15.324
Oh, my god.

01:15.325 --> 01:16.792
We've just been robbed.

Clark?

02:02.252 --> 02:03.694

Season 4 Episode 19

03:06.300 --> 03:08.800
Original Airdate April 27, 2005

03:40.498 --> 03:42.103
It must be kind of
weird seeing the house

03:42.105 --> 03:44.003
you grew up in for
the first time.

03:45.550 --> 03:47.909
Do you recognize anything?

03:47.910 --> 03:50.809
I mean, the house or the cows...

03:50.810 --> 03:52.906
the tractor, anything?

03:53.405 --> 03:54.884
You sure this is where I live?

03:55.980 --> 03:56.929
Yeah.

03:58.340 --> 04:01.262
Um, you spend most of
your time over there.

04:04.939 --> 04:05.876
In a barn?

04:05.878 --> 04:08.640
Well, normal was never really
your style, Clark.

04:11.320 --> 04:13.359
That was my attempt at humor.

04:13.364 --> 04:15.829
Sometimes I crash
and burn. Sorry.

04:30.389 --> 04:31.265
Clark.

04:32.130 --> 04:33.437
It's your house.

04:35.664 --> 04:36.527
Right.

04:46.110 --> 04:47.553
I... it was

04:48.388 --> 04:49.843
it was stuck.

04:50.819 --> 04:53.112
Actually, I think it was locked.

05:10.534 --> 05:11.853
Mr. Kent!

05:12.588 --> 05:14.191
Mrs. Kent!

05:16.393 --> 05:18.167
What the hell
happened to the door?

05:18.168 --> 05:19.236
You know, I tried to open it...

05:19.237 --> 05:22.972
yeah, and then some freak wind
came and blew it right off.

05:23.802 --> 05:24.801
Right.

05:25.610 --> 05:27.768
So, Lois, do you know
where the Kents are?

05:28.263 --> 05:31.050
They're in Metropolis
for Mr. Kent's heart exam.

05:31.117 --> 05:32.831
Clark, you know that.

05:33.089 --> 05:34.579
Well, not so much.

05:34.580 --> 05:36.658
He has amnesia,
and he's having a hard time...

05:36.659 --> 05:37.422
again?

05:37.668 --> 05:39.036
What do you mean "again"?

05:42.247 --> 05:44.688
Well, at least this time,
you got clothes on.

05:44.689 --> 05:46.771
Lois, we need to get
his parents back home.

05:46.772 --> 05:48.074
Well, that's gonna be a little hard.

05:48.075 --> 05:50.939
Mr. Kent has a one-way ticket
on the ambient express.

05:50.940 --> 05:53.431
He's gonna be out of
commission for a few days.

05:54.334 --> 05:55.776
So, what happened?

05:56.788 --> 06:00.061
Well, the last thing I remember,
I woke up in the alley. I was with...

06:00.062 --> 06:00.900
Chloe.

06:00.999 --> 06:02.575
I'm thinking he caught
up to whoever was

06:02.585 --> 06:04.735
behind the "robbery in
plain sight" incident.

06:05.226 --> 06:08.258
And, what, we have a thief
with memory repo?

06:10.330 --> 06:13.582
I guess that could explain why,
in some weird Smallville an way,

06:13.583 --> 06:16.588
I zoned on eight coffee orders
before I found the till was empty.

06:16.589 --> 06:18.901
I'm gonna go to the Torch and see
what I can find out about amnesia.

06:18.902 --> 06:21.071
Yeah, just leave
Mr. Memory reboot to me.

06:21.097 --> 06:22.776
I'm getting to be
a pro at this.

06:22.777 --> 06:24.486
But you know what? You're
gonna have to put up with

06:24.489 --> 06:27.271
pb&j because that's the
extent of my culinary skills.

06:29.154 --> 06:30.103
Okay?

06:30.679 --> 06:33.707
Uh, please tell me I'm not related to her.

06:33.708 --> 06:35.791
No. I am. You live with her.

06:35.904 --> 06:36.668
Clark.

06:39.508 --> 06:40.445
Uh...

06:41.679 --> 06:42.727
you know what?

06:43.734 --> 06:47.112
I'm gonna take him up to the barn,
see if anything up there jogs his memory.

06:47.538 --> 06:49.055
All right, suit yourself.

06:49.688 --> 06:51.007
We need to talk.

06:59.437 --> 07:01.730
What's with the Cheshire cat routine?

07:02.772 --> 07:05.583
A little something from central Kansas.

07:06.190 --> 07:07.399
Congratulations.

07:07.425 --> 07:08.770
I think if they were
gonna reject you, they

07:08.778 --> 07:10.543
probably wouldn't have
sent you a novella.

07:10.648 --> 07:12.725
No, probably not.

07:12.726 --> 07:14.442
Hey, I was thinking
that we could go check out

07:14.445 --> 07:16.115
the dorms on campus this weekend.

07:16.681 --> 07:19.849
Jason, I'm not sure that
I'm gonna go to central Kansas.

07:20.039 --> 07:23.007
I'm not even sure
if I'm gonna go to college at all.

07:24.651 --> 07:26.634
I've actually given this a lot of thought.

07:26.635 --> 07:27.609
Which part...

07:28.279 --> 07:31.026
the part that we've been planning
this for an entire year?

07:31.529 --> 07:33.128
Lana, I thought this was our one chance

07:33.129 --> 07:36.387
to put everything that's happened
over the past couple months behind us.

07:36.731 --> 07:38.679
It would be like Paris all over again.

07:38.680 --> 07:39.511
How?

07:42.089 --> 07:44.789
Jason, last summer was incredible.

07:44.907 --> 07:46.831
But we have to face it.

07:47.208 --> 07:49.001
We haven't been able to recreate that here,

07:49.002 --> 07:51.115
not with everything that's happened,

07:51.116 --> 07:54.518
not with the stones or your mom
and all of the lies.

07:54.568 --> 07:55.850
How long have you known?

07:57.397 --> 07:59.567
I mean, your feelings don't
just change overnight, so

07:59.593 --> 08:01.616
you've obviously been
thinking about this a while.

08:01.617 --> 08:02.974
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

08:03.719 --> 08:06.019
Ever since this turned into the same relationship

08:06.020 --> 08:08.671
I was trying to leave
behind when I went to Paris.

08:08.672 --> 08:10.009
Oh, so this is about Clark.

08:10.010 --> 08:12.569
No, it's not about Clark.

08:12.570 --> 08:14.432
Jason, it's about us.

08:15.353 --> 08:17.338
There are too many secrets.

08:18.573 --> 08:22.776
I kept wishing that we could wipe
the slate clean, but we can't.

08:24.126 --> 08:25.470
A chance like that...

08:26.874 --> 08:29.377
maybe it only comes
around once in a lifetime.

08:41.173 --> 08:42.808
You were the one
part of my life that

08:42.817 --> 08:44.733
made me forget what
I've turned into.

08:45.267 --> 08:46.379
What are you talking about?

08:46.380 --> 08:47.895
Just don't give up on me.

08:48.310 --> 08:49.049
Jason...

08:49.050 --> 08:52.711
okay? You have no idea
how much I've been protecting you.

08:53.394 --> 08:54.257
Do you?

09:11.702 --> 09:12.553
Here.

09:12.783 --> 09:13.954
Bend this.

09:16.552 --> 09:18.697
This is metal. I can't bend this.

09:18.994 --> 09:22.198
Just like you can't pull
a door off its hinges, right?

09:22.350 --> 09:23.250
Try it.

09:36.156 --> 09:37.537
How did I do that?

09:41.170 --> 09:45.105
Why did I always picture myself
on the other end of this conversation?

09:47.607 --> 09:49.703
Um, here, come here, sit.

09:51.658 --> 09:56.520
Smallville was hit with the world's biggest
meteor shower when you were little.

09:56.521 --> 10:00.010
Now, I know this sounds
way out there, but

10:00.137 --> 10:02.764
some of the meteor rocks have had an...

10:02.765 --> 10:06.611
an extraterrestrial effect on
certain people in the town.

10:07.027 --> 10:10.366
And it's my theory that
you were one of them.

10:11.076 --> 10:14.045
Extraterrestrial powers?
You mean I'm some sort of alien?

10:14.046 --> 10:15.846
No, of course not.

10:15.925 --> 10:17.119
A mutant?

10:19.949 --> 10:20.863
Uh...

10:21.939 --> 10:23.031
yeah.

10:23.549 --> 10:27.098
Who has saved my life
on more than one occasion.

10:27.580 --> 10:29.195
See, you've sort of

10:29.529 --> 10:33.364
taken it up on yourself
to be Smallville's self-appointed hero.

10:33.756 --> 10:35.766
And if you ask me, I...

10:35.767 --> 10:38.812
I think that that is... amazing.

10:53.239 --> 10:56.460
We must've been pretty good friends
if I trusted you with all this.

11:00.428 --> 11:02.869
Yeah, well, actually...

11:03.895 --> 11:05.091
you didn't.

11:07.359 --> 11:10.009
It's okay. I mean, you were just
protecting yourself.

11:10.282 --> 11:12.809
A lot of people would be
tray you if they knew.

11:15.014 --> 11:16.279
But you wouldn't...

11:17.393 --> 11:18.293
would you?

11:21.596 --> 11:22.397
Never.

11:30.453 --> 11:34.336
So, Lois said that she was standing
right here the whole time.

11:34.856 --> 11:37.196
I don't know why we just
don't call the police.

11:37.777 --> 11:41.358
The same reason why I didn't just
take you to the hospital. Clark...

11:41.359 --> 11:43.089
the last thing we want
is to get you on the

11:43.090 --> 11:45.234
radar of Smallville's
friendliest authorities.

11:45.389 --> 11:48.742
Now, can you see
if you can find anything?

11:58.093 --> 11:59.030
Chloe.

11:59.631 --> 12:01.529
Is there something there?

12:02.155 --> 12:05.139
Back behind the... near your feet.
Under the mat.

12:05.689 --> 12:08.079
Okay, how'd you know that was there?

12:08.728 --> 12:10.109
Well, I... I could...

12:10.184 --> 12:11.934
I guess...

12:12.344 --> 12:14.330
I... I can see through things.

12:15.423 --> 12:19.799
Hold on a minute, are you telling me that
you can see through solid objects?

12:22.736 --> 12:24.361
I guess that's one
you didn't know about, huh?

12:24.375 --> 12:25.989
No, uh,

12:26.024 --> 12:30.287
and, uh, that might be one of those abilities
you're gonna want to keep a lid on.

12:31.118 --> 12:32.967
You know, I've been thinking about that.

12:33.149 --> 12:33.901
You know,

12:34.945 --> 12:37.788
I don't know why I was worried
so much about what people think.

12:37.789 --> 12:40.465
I don't know why I let it ruin my life.
I mean, you understood.

12:40.466 --> 12:43.210
Yeah, but, Clark, unfortunately,

12:43.211 --> 12:45.428
some people in Smallville
aren't as progressive...

12:45.454 --> 12:46.862
as your post-amnesia
tour guide.

12:46.863 --> 12:48.800
That should be their problem, not mine.

12:48.801 --> 12:54.269
Look, I understand how eager you are
to throw an impromptu coming-out party.

12:54.270 --> 12:56.790
I mean, I've only spent
the last couple of hours

12:56.800 --> 12:58.055
blocking for the man behind the mask,

12:58.060 --> 13:00.172
and it's not as easy as
I thought it would be.

13:00.173 --> 13:02.227
But, please, just sleep on it.

13:02.228 --> 13:03.631
I know. It's just...

13:04.304 --> 13:07.534
I mean, how can anyone ever get
to know me if I'm never myself?

13:07.545 --> 13:09.270
I know it's hard,

13:09.315 --> 13:11.560
but I imagine that if you
didn't tell people, you

13:11.567 --> 13:14.193
must've had a lifetime of
reasons for not doing it.

13:14.787 --> 13:18.227
So that's why we need
to get your memory back.

13:18.342 --> 13:19.645
So I can do what...

13:19.646 --> 13:20.926
get back to lying to everyone?

13:20.927 --> 13:21.531
Clark...

13:21.538 --> 13:22.814
Chloe, I'm not sure
I want that life back.

13:22.815 --> 13:25.466
At least wait until you can talk
to your parents, okay?

13:32.021 --> 13:32.825
Clark?

13:34.232 --> 13:35.132
Clark?

13:55.509 --> 13:59.072
Premature combustion.
That's one I didn't need to know about.

14:04.444 --> 14:05.643
Who is that?

14:08.228 --> 14:08.967
That...

14:10.447 --> 14:11.924
is Lana Lang.

14:19.569 --> 14:21.098
The love of your life.

15:02.581 --> 15:05.207
Looks like one more thing you don't remember.

15:05.482 --> 15:08.059
You usually hide all those emotions.

15:12.168 --> 15:15.312
I came to ask if you were doing okay.

15:16.124 --> 15:16.888
But...

15:17.874 --> 15:19.785
it looks like I got my answer.

15:20.293 --> 15:22.963
My life is a complete void.
How would you feel?

15:23.759 --> 15:26.237
Oh, pity party... these are fun.

15:26.765 --> 15:30.007
Look, Chloe's very protective of me.

15:31.280 --> 15:33.696
I guess there's a lot
of people that I can't trust.

15:34.157 --> 15:36.117
And you can't tell who they are.

15:38.278 --> 15:41.250
Look, you may not remember
all the players on the board,

15:41.401 --> 15:43.583
but you can still play the game.

15:45.064 --> 15:47.061
Are you gonna tell me
how I'm supposed to do that?

15:47.682 --> 15:49.002
Trust your gut.

15:53.114 --> 15:54.791
Like, what's it say about me?

15:58.045 --> 15:59.969
We don't like each other very much.

16:02.084 --> 16:03.441
You're on the right track.

16:04.153 --> 16:05.422
Keep it up, Smallville.

16:44.716 --> 16:45.989
Hi, Clark.

16:47.490 --> 16:48.291
Hi.

16:48.652 --> 16:50.760
I heard about what happened to you.

16:52.527 --> 16:55.879
Oh, I'm sorry. I suppose you
don't even know who I am.

16:55.880 --> 16:56.879
Lana.

17:04.980 --> 17:07.150
I was gonna come by later.

17:07.151 --> 17:09.346
I didn't think I'd see you here.

17:09.875 --> 17:11.772
I actually came here to see you.

17:15.398 --> 17:17.125
Chloe... she...

17:18.429 --> 17:20.623
she told me that we used to, uh...

17:20.624 --> 17:21.561
Yeah,

17:22.185 --> 17:23.185
Yeah, we did.

17:26.108 --> 17:27.306
What happened?

17:31.746 --> 17:33.336
Please, I just...

17:35.092 --> 17:36.800
I'd really like to know.

17:37.541 --> 17:38.909
So would I.

17:42.296 --> 17:43.517
It was me?

17:53.602 --> 17:55.118
I don't understand.

17:57.089 --> 18:00.379
If I felt anywhere near like I feel now...

18:02.265 --> 18:03.708
you know, don't tell me.

18:04.660 --> 18:06.078
I don't want to know.

18:06.938 --> 18:09.160
I don't want to know,
because this time,

18:10.251 --> 18:11.533
it'll be different.

18:15.335 --> 18:16.666
This time?

18:19.434 --> 18:20.346
Um...

18:22.323 --> 18:24.973
I don't think we should talk
about this right now.

18:28.945 --> 18:31.300
When can we talk about this?

18:37.106 --> 18:38.549
How did he get here?

18:41.111 --> 18:43.762
Looks like the heart remembers
more than the brain.

18:46.630 --> 18:48.039
Come on, cuz,

18:48.040 --> 18:49.390
don't give one more second of

18:49.398 --> 18:51.796
thought to those
vacant baby blues.

18:52.995 --> 18:53.784
Hey,

18:53.978 --> 18:54.940
good news. Uh,

18:54.941 --> 18:58.529
we traced that day pass we found...
to grand view motocross park.

18:58.581 --> 19:00.430
It belongs to a guy
named Kevin Grady.

19:00.742 --> 19:04.229
He lives in Smallville, so we thought
we'd go check out the address.

19:04.321 --> 19:05.270
Coming?

19:23.035 --> 19:23.997
Kevin?

19:26.193 --> 19:27.496
What are you doing here?

19:27.497 --> 19:29.856
Look, I'm sorry, dad,
but I couldn't stay there any longer.

19:29.857 --> 19:32.460
Kev, you have to go back.
You're in the middle of your treatment.

19:32.461 --> 19:33.818
It's not working.

19:34.187 --> 19:37.036
Look, I know you want to keep
what I did to Dylan a secret,

19:37.334 --> 19:40.097
but no matter what they do
to try to make me forget it,

19:40.434 --> 19:41.866
I'll always know the truth.

19:41.867 --> 19:42.471
Kev...

19:42.489 --> 19:43.650
don't worry about me,

19:43.651 --> 19:45.944
okay? I've got money together.
I'll be fine.

19:46.951 --> 19:50.511
After what I did, I can't expect you
to look at me every day.

19:51.774 --> 19:53.323
Kevin, please let us help you.

19:53.324 --> 19:54.773
You can't.

19:55.684 --> 19:58.450
That place turned me into
some kind of freak.

19:59.068 --> 20:00.276
What do you mean?

20:01.014 --> 20:02.111
This.

20:14.192 --> 20:15.130
Yes?

20:15.554 --> 20:16.417
Hi.

20:16.552 --> 20:19.076
I'm here to collect on a little
spontaneous line of credit

20:19.077 --> 20:20.929
your son decided to take out
with the talon,

20:20.930 --> 20:22.761
along with two minutes
of my memory.

20:22.762 --> 20:24.487
Uh, you must be mistaken.

20:24.488 --> 20:27.003
Well, actually, Mr. Grady,
we found this

20:27.047 --> 20:29.171
by the register at the talon.
It's Kevin's.

20:29.172 --> 20:30.594
We just want to talk to him.

20:31.560 --> 20:34.250
I'm afraid that's not possible.
My son is out of town at the moment.

20:34.255 --> 20:36.175
And by "out of town",
I'm guessing you're meaning

20:36.180 --> 20:39.275
undergoing some kind of treatment
at Summerholt institute.

20:40.751 --> 20:44.800
I'm sorry, I couldn't help but notice
the parking pass on your windshield.

20:47.895 --> 20:50.653
I believe that's nobody's
business but ours. Excuse me.

20:50.654 --> 20:52.208
Look, we're not saying he did it.

20:52.674 --> 20:54.523
We just need to find out what he knows.

21:05.589 --> 21:06.353
All right.

21:08.056 --> 21:11.397
Yes, my son is a patient at summerholt.

21:12.142 --> 21:14.768
Last fall, I took both my boys hunting

21:15.465 --> 21:16.870
at Audrey clearing.

21:17.801 --> 21:19.207
There was an accident.

21:20.584 --> 21:23.049
Kevin was loading his gun, and, uh...

21:25.610 --> 21:27.298
I lost my son Dylan.

21:32.337 --> 21:33.928
Mr. Grady, I'm sorry.

21:36.060 --> 21:38.665
Kevin couldn't live with himself.
He was, uh...

21:40.232 --> 21:42.377
and I didn't know which way to turn,

21:42.733 --> 21:43.645
so I...

21:44.283 --> 21:47.510
well, we thought that if summerholt

21:47.658 --> 21:49.864
could help erase those memories, well, then

21:49.865 --> 21:52.195
maybe Kevin could get on with his life.

21:55.260 --> 21:56.629
Excuse me, uh,

21:56.751 --> 21:58.477
I need to try and find my son.

21:58.478 --> 21:59.254
Thank you.

22:05.976 --> 22:08.041
Look, it tugs at the heartstrings, but

22:08.042 --> 22:09.842
I'm not sure I totally buy it.

22:10.073 --> 22:11.590
I'm gonna go have a look around.

22:19.794 --> 22:21.114
Clark, are you okay?

22:22.084 --> 22:23.662
I can hear someone running.

22:24.209 --> 22:24.913
What?

22:24.961 --> 22:27.799
And the super Wheaties abilities
just keep coming.

22:27.800 --> 22:28.891
Where are they?

22:28.892 --> 22:30.394
They're on the side of the house.

22:30.395 --> 22:31.392
Well, go get them.

22:31.393 --> 22:33.662
It sounds like he's on a motorcycle now.

22:34.634 --> 22:36.025
Trust me on this one, Clark. Run.

22:36.026 --> 22:37.862
- Chloe...
- Just run, Clark!

23:07.827 --> 23:10.897
I guess the whole castle thing
didn't take off in the neighborhood?

23:11.173 --> 23:13.110
I can't believe I'm friends with a billionaire.

23:13.111 --> 23:15.897
Funny. You never seemed
that impressed before.

23:18.997 --> 23:20.317
Mr. Luthor.

23:22.614 --> 23:23.675
Lex.

23:23.893 --> 23:26.205
I'm guessing you don't remember it,
but we kind of dropped

23:26.208 --> 23:28.631
the formalities the
day I ran you off a bridge.

23:28.720 --> 23:31.473
Look, as much as I'm sure we're all
enjoying this little icebreaker,

23:31.474 --> 23:33.222
we did come here for a reason.

23:33.223 --> 23:36.181
I was hoping that you still had your contact
at the summerholt institute.

23:36.182 --> 23:38.833
Chloe mentioned that they had done
some experiments on you.

23:38.883 --> 23:41.063
Yeah, we were guessing that
the guy that did this to Clark

23:41.064 --> 23:44.418
is undergoing some sort of treatment
to have his memory wiped.

23:45.080 --> 23:49.001
Probably not too far of a leap, given
their unnerving advancements in the field.

23:49.037 --> 23:52.053
Look, I'll make a few calls,
see what I can find.

23:52.554 --> 23:54.573
Chloe, if you don't mind, uh,

23:54.574 --> 23:56.313
I'd like to have a word with Clark.

23:57.286 --> 24:00.196
Well, I promised his parents
that I would get him home.

24:00.315 --> 24:02.472
Well, I think I can manage that.

24:03.849 --> 24:06.278
It's all right, Chloe. You could use
a break from chaperone duty.

24:06.279 --> 24:07.448
I'll be okay.

24:09.541 --> 24:10.379
Okay.

24:17.854 --> 24:18.913
Clark...

24:19.263 --> 24:20.619
be careful.

24:26.848 --> 24:30.144
Clark, I think I might know something
that could jog your memory.

24:35.940 --> 24:37.716
I found these caves?

24:38.115 --> 24:40.615
And ever since, the two of us
have been working together

24:40.616 --> 24:42.724
trying to solve its mysteries.

24:43.141 --> 24:45.100
But that's just between you and me.

24:47.156 --> 24:48.809
What do all these symbols mean?

24:49.738 --> 24:53.350
I know it'll probably sound strange,
but we think they're about you.

24:56.243 --> 24:57.143
Wait.

24:58.063 --> 25:00.628
There should be a two-headed
monster over here.

25:03.348 --> 25:05.394
Then you remember this place.

25:05.402 --> 25:08.139
No, I recognize it
from the drawings in the loft.

25:10.322 --> 25:12.593
We were, uh, documenting them.

25:13.800 --> 25:14.614
Wait.

25:15.972 --> 25:18.007
This wall shouldn't be here.

25:18.955 --> 25:19.978
What do you mean?

25:20.058 --> 25:23.431
Well, in the drawings,
it shows a room behind this wall.

25:26.205 --> 25:29.187
Clark, maybe we should head back to the loft
and take a closer look at the pictures.

25:29.188 --> 25:31.000
I could help explain them to you.

25:35.562 --> 25:38.669
No, I should probably get back.
I don't want my parents to worry.

25:39.684 --> 25:40.645
Of course.

27:01.860 --> 27:03.383
- Hello?
- Lois.

27:03.384 --> 27:04.537
Hey, Chloe, are you in?

27:04.539 --> 27:06.684
Yeah, Incoming. Check my e-mail.

27:06.685 --> 27:07.865
I've got it.

27:12.408 --> 27:13.628
Chloe...

27:14.486 --> 27:15.411
Lois.

27:15.461 --> 27:17.162
Clark, you've got to look at this.

27:17.926 --> 27:20.021
Chloe called and told me
to download some files

27:20.022 --> 27:21.641
she e-mailed from summerholt.

27:21.642 --> 27:22.733
How'd she get in?

27:22.734 --> 27:26.630
I've learned never to underestimate Chloe,
especially when it comes to helping you.

27:27.771 --> 27:29.050
You don't have to do this.

27:29.051 --> 27:30.914
I won't tell anyone, I promise.

27:30.915 --> 27:32.407
I won't tell them what happened.

27:33.111 --> 27:34.615
I know it was an accident.

27:34.989 --> 27:36.597
I know you didn't mean to.

27:36.825 --> 27:38.526
Kevin didn't kill his brother.

27:38.527 --> 27:41.967
Whoever erased Kevin's memories
must've planted a few new ones.

27:41.968 --> 27:43.743
Why would someone do that...

27:43.823 --> 27:46.683
let Kevin walk around thinking
he killed his own brother?

27:46.793 --> 27:49.426
Someone who obviously
can't live with themselves.

27:50.181 --> 27:51.870
I need to find Kevin.

27:52.189 --> 27:53.632
And where are you gonna find him?

27:53.633 --> 27:56.274
Where his brother died.
It seems like a pretty good place to start.

27:56.275 --> 27:58.491
Wait a minute.
Didn't his dad say

27:58.492 --> 28:00.094
that the accident happened at...

28:00.828 --> 28:02.148
Audrey clearing?

28:04.140 --> 28:05.175
Clark?

28:27.590 --> 28:28.453
Kevin.

28:28.588 --> 28:29.833
No, it's okay.

28:29.974 --> 28:32.242
Listen, I came here
to talk to you about summerholt.

28:35.457 --> 28:37.085
You're the guy from the talon.

28:38.287 --> 28:39.814
How do you remember me?

28:40.210 --> 28:41.221
I don't.

28:41.713 --> 28:44.056
Whatever you did to me
erased all my memories.

28:44.355 --> 28:45.379
All of them?

28:47.150 --> 28:49.546
Everyone else... it just wiped out
the last few minutes.

28:49.547 --> 28:51.491
I guess I'm not like everyone else.

28:52.983 --> 28:56.361
Look, Kevin, I know it's gonna be hard,
but I need to talk to you about the accident.

29:00.331 --> 29:01.922
Is this where it happened?

29:04.323 --> 29:05.815
Somewhere here.

29:09.043 --> 29:11.978
I know. It was somewhere here.

29:12.953 --> 29:14.802
Just tell me what happened that day.

29:29.654 --> 29:32.293
Do you have any real memories
from that day?

29:45.892 --> 29:47.261
Kevin, what is it?

29:49.250 --> 29:50.459
I'm not sure.

29:51.561 --> 29:53.816
I've been trying to block
the memories out.

29:54.073 --> 29:55.404
Or maybe

29:55.600 --> 29:57.733
someone has already blocked
them out for you.

30:03.498 --> 30:04.349
No.

30:04.719 --> 30:07.560
No. I was loading my gun.
It was right here.

30:07.561 --> 30:09.333
But do you actually remember that?

30:09.334 --> 30:10.530
Do you remember loading your gun,

30:10.531 --> 30:12.366
or do you remember
someone telling you that?

30:36.971 --> 30:38.328
I didn't do it.

30:41.738 --> 30:43.104
It was my dad.

30:48.217 --> 30:49.894
How could he do that to me?

30:52.937 --> 30:54.442
I'm sorry, Kevin.

31:00.335 --> 31:01.604
I don't get it.

31:02.389 --> 31:05.756
I robbed the talon,
and I 86'd your memory.

31:06.511 --> 31:08.752
I mean, why would you go
through all this trouble for me?

31:11.044 --> 31:12.590
I guess I just know what it's like

31:12.591 --> 31:14.280
to lose a part of your life.

31:19.636 --> 31:21.805
I'm sorry, there's nothing
I can do for you.

31:22.064 --> 31:24.948
I mean, our only chance is
to break into summerholt, but

31:24.999 --> 31:27.033
there's no way
I can get you in there.

31:28.054 --> 31:29.053
Maybe I can.

31:35.718 --> 31:38.193
Look, this guy's kid robbed
me, then plucked

31:38.198 --> 31:40.425
the last forget-me-not petal
from my friend's brain.

31:40.426 --> 31:44.029
You will let me back there, and
you can do it with or without handcuffs.

31:44.030 --> 31:47.570
Like I said, if you would sign in,
I'll let someone know that you're here.

31:47.788 --> 31:49.959
What part of this isn't
getting through to you?

31:49.960 --> 31:52.308
The last time I spoke
to my cousin, she was here.

31:52.309 --> 31:55.255
And I'm sure the psycho
is holding her back there somewhere.

31:56.277 --> 31:57.399
Ms. Lane.

31:59.849 --> 32:01.938
Maybe they pay you enough to be rude,

32:01.939 --> 32:05.157
but I doubt they pay you enough
to do time in the county jail.

32:12.979 --> 32:14.619
Wait. Wasn't it locked?

32:15.386 --> 32:16.792
I think it was broken.

32:31.590 --> 32:34.154
We should be able to reach
the main office from down here.

32:39.551 --> 32:40.438
Clark.

32:41.834 --> 32:43.177
Clark, are you okay?

32:43.982 --> 32:45.758
You go ahead. I'll catch up.

33:06.429 --> 33:09.257
I wish I could erase your memories
from just the last three days,

33:09.258 --> 33:11.465
but I'm afraid I can't take that chance.

33:11.654 --> 33:13.762
I'm gonna have to go back
much further than that.

33:13.763 --> 33:15.547
Mr. Grady, please don't do that.

33:15.548 --> 33:17.151
Think of it as a gift.

33:17.791 --> 33:20.861
Do you realize how many experiences in life

33:20.902 --> 33:22.986
would be so much less painful

33:24.496 --> 33:27.122
if we didn't have the memories to haunt us?

33:41.190 --> 33:44.074
Dad! What, were you just gonna lie
to me my whole life, huh?

33:44.405 --> 33:46.576
To make me think I killed my own brother.

33:46.577 --> 33:47.774
Kevin, calm down.

33:47.775 --> 33:50.919
You're obviously having a psychological
reaction to your treatment.

33:53.139 --> 33:55.642
No one regrets what
happened more than I do.

34:53.368 --> 34:54.194
Chloe!

35:18.963 --> 35:20.257
Wow.

35:20.559 --> 35:22.532
Dear god in heaven.

35:37.435 --> 35:39.543
Lois, sheriff.

35:40.887 --> 35:43.784
I guess I shouldn't
call you Smallville anymore.

36:04.115 --> 36:05.746
Clark, what are you doing?

36:05.747 --> 36:08.691
Are you just gonna stand there all day,
or are you gonna untie her?

36:11.780 --> 36:12.766
Hi.

36:12.919 --> 36:13.868
Thanks.

36:21.739 --> 36:24.365
You said how'd you come across
those tapes, miss Sullivan?

36:24.488 --> 36:26.337
Well, I was being led into the data room...

36:41.081 --> 36:42.080
Hey.

36:44.321 --> 36:45.921
You're that kid from the alley.

36:47.536 --> 36:49.434
I tried to pull you out of your car,

36:49.661 --> 36:52.891
and that's the last thing I remember
before what just happened in the lab.

36:53.794 --> 36:57.129
Yeah, I'm sorry about that again, Clark.
That was kind of my fault.

36:57.839 --> 37:00.428
I don't know what you did
back there or why,

37:01.491 --> 37:03.031
but I get the feeling I owe you one.

37:03.052 --> 37:06.353
I like to see it as
a "now we're even" situation.

37:08.075 --> 37:10.599
Something tells me
I shouldn't stop you from leaving.

37:10.600 --> 37:13.250
It's better if people don't ask
too many questions about me.

37:19.055 --> 37:21.557
Thanks for the chance
at a clean slate, Clark.

37:40.990 --> 37:41.877
Clark...

37:42.763 --> 37:44.451
I was just looking for you.

37:45.780 --> 37:48.816
Congratulations.
I heard you got full retrieval.

37:49.234 --> 37:50.344
Everything.

37:53.590 --> 37:55.970
Everything except the last 24 hours.

37:56.279 --> 37:58.314
Well, you didn't miss much, but

37:58.335 --> 38:01.219
I wanted to come in person
to see the old Clark back.

38:04.170 --> 38:04.984
Lex...

38:06.284 --> 38:09.467
Chloe said she left me at the mansion
because you wanted to talk.

38:10.137 --> 38:12.085
What is it you wanted to talk about?

38:14.211 --> 38:16.899
I just told you about
my own memory loss.

38:17.198 --> 38:18.948
I thought it might be comforting.

38:21.847 --> 38:24.880
I'm lucky to have so many
good friends watching out for me.

38:26.016 --> 38:28.235
Nothing you wouldn't
have done for me, Clark.

39:30.795 --> 39:33.286
Hi, I'm early, I know. I'm sorry.

39:38.054 --> 39:39.978
I guess I'm just a little nervous.

39:40.215 --> 39:41.694
What are you nervous about?

39:44.688 --> 39:46.957
Were we supposed to do something?

39:49.444 --> 39:52.292
Lana, I'm sorry. I don't remember
anything from the last day.

39:53.612 --> 39:54.340
Oh.

39:56.102 --> 39:58.272
But everything else you remember now.

40:00.987 --> 40:02.269
It's probably for the best.

40:05.824 --> 40:07.268
Were our plans,

40:07.340 --> 40:09.621
like, date kind of plans?

40:12.130 --> 40:13.869
Because what about Jason?

40:17.812 --> 40:20.339
Clark, you just wanted to talk.

40:20.395 --> 40:22.443
It's nothing that can't wait till later.

40:27.088 --> 40:28.384
Lana, wait.

40:31.586 --> 40:33.287
I can't do this.

40:35.918 --> 40:38.225
I can't let you walk out, not again.

40:40.980 --> 40:42.138
It's okay.

40:42.588 --> 40:44.348
We both know better than this.

40:44.349 --> 40:45.336
I know.

40:49.630 --> 40:51.899
That's why this time it'll be different.

40:56.541 --> 40:57.713
This time?

41:15.845 --> 41:18.357
"Summerholt memory Lane shut down."

41:27.383 --> 41:28.689
Are you Chloe?

41:32.021 --> 41:33.254
That's funny.

41:33.441 --> 41:35.365
It's not hilarious, but it's funny.

41:36.353 --> 41:37.972
My parents told me
that you Clark-sat and

41:37.985 --> 41:39.830
you called them home
from Metropolis.

41:40.533 --> 41:41.815
I want to say thanks.

41:42.752 --> 41:45.828
Well, you could still use some help
with your comedy routine,

41:45.829 --> 41:48.971
but it's not like I taught you
to eat solid foods again.

41:49.103 --> 41:50.200
Still.

41:50.453 --> 41:51.600
You're welcome.

41:54.610 --> 41:56.610
So it must've been kind
of strange to have a zombie

41:56.620 --> 41:58.573
best friend walking around.

41:59.675 --> 42:03.682
Yeah, I mean, you know,
I never really realized how

42:03.688 --> 42:06.265
complicated that zombie's life was.

42:08.127 --> 42:09.396
Complicated.

42:12.213 --> 42:14.099
Did I do something unusual?

42:16.793 --> 42:19.481
You had a clean slate to start all over with,

42:19.482 --> 42:21.836
and you made all the same choices...

42:22.065 --> 42:23.409
except for one.

42:27.070 --> 42:29.806
Chloe, I need you to be
completely honest with me.

42:30.721 --> 42:32.090
Honest, huh?

42:36.355 --> 42:37.576
What'd I do?

42:40.782 --> 42:42.421
You trusted me.
