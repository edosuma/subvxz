WEBVTT

00:02.709 --> 00:04.844
Ohh.

00:04.911 --> 00:07.212
Oh, this family spends too much time watching TV

00:07.280 --> 00:08.614
and not enough time talking.

00:08.682 --> 00:12.050
Honey, you're talking right now.

00:12.118 --> 00:13.552
Mike.

00:13.620 --> 00:14.753
Besides, this is educational.

00:14.821 --> 00:16.989
Oh, come on.
How is that educational?

00:17.056 --> 00:21.793
I'm teaching Eve here how not
to be a gator-huntin' hillbilly.

00:21.861 --> 00:23.691
Hey, dad, can we get a swamp boat?

00:23.811 --> 00:24.853
Yep.

00:26.431 --> 00:28.933
Ohh. Well, Boyd's down. Ooh.

00:29.001 --> 00:30.267
Did they catch that big gator yet?

00:30.335 --> 00:32.136
No, but the toothless guy
fell in the water

00:32.204 --> 00:34.972
trying to save his jug.

00:35.039 --> 00:37.574
Speaking of jugs, look at the grandma.

00:38.743 --> 00:39.977
That's-- that's enough.

00:40.044 --> 00:42.946
Come on. That's enough of this. Come on.

00:43.014 --> 00:45.181
All right. I'll turn it off. We'll talk. Let's go.

00:45.249 --> 00:51.001
Great. So, Kristin, are you
excited, college girl?

00:51.388 --> 00:54.390
Mom, I'm taking one class.
It's hardly college.

00:54.457 --> 00:56.959
She's right. It's not college
till you take six classes

00:57.027 --> 00:59.461
<i>and only show up for one.</i>

01:01.498 --> 01:03.365
I am really excited, though,
because they say that

01:03.433 --> 01:04.667
students who spend time
in the real world

01:04.735 --> 01:06.300
do better in college.

01:06.368 --> 01:07.702
Why?

01:07.770 --> 01:08.837
You know, because their
life experience helps them.

01:08.905 --> 01:09.971
Why?

01:10.039 --> 01:12.240
I don't know, Eve.
I can't explain it.

01:12.307 --> 01:15.777
Well, then maybe it hasn't helped you.

01:15.845 --> 01:16.811
Mom!

01:16.879 --> 01:17.946
All right, honey, relax.

01:18.014 --> 01:19.047
It's gonna be great.

01:19.114 --> 01:20.815
Look, college transformed me.

01:20.883 --> 01:22.282
I was a nerd in high school,

01:22.350 --> 01:25.819
and then I went to Ohio State,
and I totally blossomed.

01:25.887 --> 01:29.890
Right, into the coolest girl
in the geology lab.

01:31.960 --> 01:35.395
Whoa. Showtime.

01:35.463 --> 01:37.364
Hey, you can run, but you can't hide!

01:37.432 --> 01:39.732
Was that
the ding dong ditcher?

01:39.800 --> 01:42.068
I don't know what that is.

01:42.135 --> 01:44.637
This is the guy that's ringing
the doorbell and running away.

01:46.707 --> 01:48.507
Did you I.D. The perp?

01:48.576 --> 01:51.878
No, but my motion-activated
video camera did.

01:51.946 --> 01:54.179
All the information's right here
on this little S.D. Card.

01:54.246 --> 01:55.346
Oh, I hope you put that camera up...

01:55.414 --> 01:56.582
After I came home,

01:56.649 --> 01:58.483
because my hair was in a bun

01:58.551 --> 02:00.586
and my makeup was running.

02:00.653 --> 02:02.120
Why was your makeup running?

02:02.188 --> 02:04.122
I just-- I was crying
my eyes out in the car.

02:04.190 --> 02:07.425
God, that Adele-- she cannot keep a man.

02:11.396 --> 02:12.763
This is more suspenseful
than on "The Bachelor"

02:12.831 --> 02:14.298
when Jason Mesnick broke up with Melissa

02:14.365 --> 02:16.133
and proposed to Molly.

02:16.201 --> 02:17.969
Yeah, that was amazing,

02:18.036 --> 02:19.770
- 'cause he had the whole date planned. They went out--
-  you remember?

02:19.838 --> 02:22.039
I didn't see it.
I don't know why I said that.

02:24.042 --> 02:25.976
All right. There we go.

02:26.043 --> 02:28.144
There we go. Right there.
Here he is.

02:28.212 --> 02:30.446
Ringing the doorbell.
Turn around.

02:31.882 --> 02:34.417
It's just a person in a red hoodie.

02:34.485 --> 02:37.153
Is he also carrying a basket
of goodies and knocking

02:37.221 --> 02:39.288
on grandma's door?

02:40.691 --> 02:43.033
Wow.
Look who remembered a book.

02:47.831 --> 02:50.232
I'm, uh, gonna get
something from the kitchen.

02:50.299 --> 02:54.044
I'm gonna go reload the video camera.

02:59.374 --> 03:00.374
Ben?

03:01.910 --> 03:02.977
Ben?

03:05.514 --> 03:06.648
Hey.

03:06.715 --> 03:09.283
Hey.
What are you doing here?

03:09.351 --> 03:10.785
I had to talk to you.

03:10.853 --> 03:12.319
Why didn't you just call?

03:12.387 --> 03:14.354
I wanted to see you.

03:14.421 --> 03:16.422
Oh.

03:18.192 --> 03:20.393
So... what did you need to say?

03:20.461 --> 03:21.528
That I can't wait to see you tomorrow.

03:23.264 --> 03:24.931
Me, too.

03:27.135 --> 03:28.068
Okay.

03:28.136 --> 03:29.602
- Okay.
- All right.

03:29.670 --> 03:31.582
- Bye.
- Bye.

03:32.088 --> 03:34.459
Last Ma Standing - S01E19
Ding Dong Ditch

03:34.579 --> 03:36.415
Original air date

Sync and corrections by Gatto
for www.addic7ed.com

03:40.547 --> 03:44.050
All right, now make sure
my bear is nice and clean.

03:44.117 --> 03:45.417
Yes, sir.

03:47.053 --> 03:49.954
Mr. Alzate, this ladder feels
a little unsteady.

03:50.022 --> 03:54.271
I know. You wanna know why?
Because it's poorly made.

03:56.095 --> 03:57.495
Please don't let go.

03:57.563 --> 03:59.664
I wouldn't dream of it.
Watch it now.

03:59.732 --> 04:01.099
Easy. Easy.

04:01.167 --> 04:02.066
There you go.

04:03.668 --> 04:05.324
Hey, Mike.

04:08.606 --> 04:10.574
What's the matter?
You look a little sleepy.

04:10.641 --> 04:13.911
I haven't been sleeping well.
There's a kid prankin' my house.

04:13.978 --> 04:15.412
Oh. Ouch. Oh.

04:15.479 --> 04:16.880
Well, I have to admit,
I like a good prank, though.

04:16.947 --> 04:18.346
- I love it. Yeah.
- Ohh.

04:18.415 --> 04:19.515
I remember in Vietnam we used
to play some dumb jokes...

04:19.583 --> 04:20.716
Mm.
I'll tell ya, like once,

04:20.784 --> 04:23.884
I opened my mess kit,
and inside was a face.

04:26.556 --> 04:27.890
But be creative
with the prank, you know,

04:27.958 --> 04:30.727
like, um, leave
a flaming bag of dog poop

04:30.794 --> 04:32.128
- on a porch or, uh... That's--
- That's good.

04:32.196 --> 04:33.395
Or a flaming box of dog poop...

04:33.463 --> 04:34.996
- Mm.
- Or put a flaming dog

04:35.064 --> 04:37.199
- in a box of poop.
- Yeah.

04:37.266 --> 04:39.567
Well, I gotta give that kid a taste

04:39.635 --> 04:40.902
of his own medicine somehow.

04:40.970 --> 04:42.704
All right.
Well, I-I like--

04:42.772 --> 04:44.106
I like where you're heading with this.

04:44.173 --> 04:46.641
All right. Okay.
How about...

04:46.709 --> 04:48.777
Bear trap?

04:48.845 --> 04:50.144
You know, I don't think I want the kid

04:50.212 --> 04:51.311
on the front lawn screaming,

04:51.379 --> 04:53.513
trying to chew his leg off.

04:53.581 --> 04:55.582
Wait a second.
Wait a second.

04:55.650 --> 04:57.051
- Mm?
- You know how loud these things are?

04:57.119 --> 04:58.619
- Oh, an air horn.
- That's right.

04:58.686 --> 05:01.255
What if I could wire this up
so when he rings my bell,

05:01.322 --> 05:02.623
he gets a little bit
of his own medicine?

05:04.059 --> 05:05.126
Ohh! Ohh!

05:09.529 --> 05:12.365
I'm okay. Don't worry.

05:12.432 --> 05:14.067
We're not.

05:14.135 --> 05:16.702
What you want to do is take
a string like this...

05:18.472 --> 05:20.807
And as such,
organic compounds are classified

05:20.875 --> 05:22.775
according to functional groups,

05:22.842 --> 05:25.477
such as carboxylic acids...

05:25.544 --> 05:27.279
Yes?

05:27.346 --> 05:30.082
Hi. Uh, is this organic chemistry?

05:30.150 --> 05:32.918
Yes. In fact, it has been
for the past ten minutes.

05:32.986 --> 05:37.422
I'm, uh... hi. Sorry.
I'm really sorry I'm late.

05:37.490 --> 05:39.356
Um, my-- my sister Mandy
drove me halfway,

05:39.424 --> 05:40.758
and then I got out and ran

05:40.826 --> 05:42.293
because it was faster and much safer.

05:44.196 --> 05:46.898
And now it's 11 minutes.

05:46.965 --> 05:49.600
Okay, now this next part
will be on the test--

05:49.668 --> 05:52.270
our good friends aliphatic hydrocarbons.

05:52.337 --> 05:53.804
Who can tell me the three groups that

05:53.871 --> 05:55.892
these hydrocarbons are divided into?

05:58.042 --> 05:59.604
What about you?

06:00.744 --> 06:02.578
Hmm? What?

06:02.646 --> 06:05.148
Uh, I-I'm, uh...

06:05.216 --> 06:07.150
I'm sorry.
Can you repeat the question?

06:07.218 --> 06:09.885
What about you?

06:15.258 --> 06:18.127
Oh. Honey, what are you doing
sitting down here in the dark?

06:19.296 --> 06:20.162
Cut the light out!

06:20.230 --> 06:21.130
Cut the light out!

06:23.200 --> 06:24.766
Kid's running late.

06:24.835 --> 06:29.337
He must have changed his pattern.

06:29.404 --> 06:31.906
Honey, you've-- you've been
down here over an hour.

06:31.974 --> 06:35.276
I've waited in duck blinds
a lot longer than this,

06:35.344 --> 06:37.645
and it would've been worth it
if you hadn't burnt the duck.

06:37.713 --> 06:41.349
Oh, stop.

06:41.416 --> 06:42.482
Shh, shh.

06:42.550 --> 06:43.583
What?

06:43.651 --> 06:44.852
- I hear him. Listen.
- Where?

06:44.919 --> 06:46.019
All right.

06:48.356 --> 06:49.356
Aah!

06:53.594 --> 06:55.929
Come on.

06:55.997 --> 06:58.597
All right. All right.

06:59.632 --> 07:00.699
Call the police.

07:00.767 --> 07:01.800
- Oh, come on, honey.
- What?

07:01.869 --> 07:03.502
Don't you think that's excessive?

07:03.570 --> 07:04.536
Yeah, you're probably right.
Let's put him in the cage

07:04.604 --> 07:07.373
- in the basement.
- No, just--

07:07.440 --> 07:09.641
Who are you?
What's your name?

07:09.709 --> 07:10.542
If I tell you, will you let me go?

07:10.610 --> 07:11.744
Yes.

07:11.811 --> 07:13.045
All right.
It's Ben Milbauer.

07:13.113 --> 07:14.312
I lied.

07:14.380 --> 07:15.347
- To the cage in the basement.
- Come on!

07:15.414 --> 07:17.015
Honey, honey, wait.

07:17.083 --> 07:18.950
But wh-why are you doing this?

07:19.018 --> 07:20.651
I don't know.

07:20.719 --> 07:23.221
You don't-- you don't know why
you're ringing our doorbell?

07:23.289 --> 07:25.823
Mom, dad, what are you doing?

07:25.892 --> 07:28.559
- We're not doing anything.
- We caught little red running hood.

07:30.328 --> 07:32.363
We-- we just want to--
we want to talk to him.

07:32.430 --> 07:34.265
Just come here. Come here.
Come sit down.

07:34.332 --> 07:36.267
Look, Ben,
I-I mean, I just-- are--

07:36.334 --> 07:38.202
do you think you're being funny?

07:38.270 --> 07:39.236
Uh, what-- what would your mother think?

07:39.304 --> 07:40.804
You know what?
Yeah.

07:40.872 --> 07:42.239
I tell you what she'd think.
She'd say you were being rude.

07:42.307 --> 07:43.840
I mean, I just-- I don't know
any other word for it.

07:43.909 --> 07:45.342
- Right.
- It's just rude

07:45.410 --> 07:47.643
and-- and, uh, and inconsiderate
and, uh, and thoughtless.

07:47.711 --> 07:50.446
Uh... uh, it's ill-mannered.

07:50.514 --> 07:52.448
Boorish.
It's just boorish to me.

07:52.516 --> 07:54.784
I-I can't even--
not to mention annoying.

07:54.851 --> 07:58.348
That cage is starting to sound
like a good idea right now.

08:00.057 --> 08:01.224
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

08:01.292 --> 08:02.557
What if he promises never
to do it again?

08:02.625 --> 08:04.726
Do you know him?

08:04.794 --> 08:06.194
No. Of course not.

08:06.262 --> 08:08.330
No, no, no. Look,
I-I promise, okay?

08:08.398 --> 08:11.033
Look, I promise it'll never
happen again. Please.

08:12.735 --> 08:15.103
He does look scared.

08:15.171 --> 08:17.872
Honey, maybe we should let him go.

08:17.940 --> 08:20.174
This is why I don't go fishing with you.

08:24.612 --> 08:25.446
All right.
Catch and release.

08:25.513 --> 08:28.549
Let's go. Come on.

08:28.616 --> 08:29.951
But you don't come back here!

08:30.018 --> 08:31.085
You come back here,

08:31.153 --> 08:32.019
next time you know what I'll do?

08:32.087 --> 08:33.321
I'll twist your head off

08:33.388 --> 08:34.955
like a hungry chimp
with a spider monkey!

08:35.022 --> 08:36.823
Whack!

08:36.890 --> 08:38.758
They do that.

08:50.015 --> 08:52.916
Hi.
Frank Milbauer, Ben's dad.

08:52.984 --> 08:55.552
Oh, hey. Mike Baxter.
Come on in.

08:55.620 --> 08:56.487
- That's my wife Vanessa.
- Hi.

08:56.554 --> 08:57.554
Hi.

08:57.622 --> 08:59.490
- Hi.
- Listen, uh, your son

08:59.557 --> 09:01.625
came by and apologized,
so we're all good.

09:01.693 --> 09:03.059
No need for you to apologize.

09:03.127 --> 09:05.729
However, if there was
a 6-pack of, uh, pale ale

09:05.797 --> 09:08.398
on the doorstep,
I wouldn't throw it away.

09:11.468 --> 09:15.104
How does it feel to bully
a 13-year-old boy?

09:15.171 --> 09:17.840
I don't think
we're getting that pale ale.

09:20.176 --> 09:22.177
You scared the hell out of my son.

09:22.245 --> 09:24.112
Well, he was trespassing, uh, Frank.

09:24.179 --> 09:25.514
Yeah, well, he was playing
a harmless prank,

09:25.581 --> 09:27.816
and <i>you</i> became Rambo.

09:27.884 --> 09:32.721
Well, you shouldn't pull
a prank on Rambo.

09:32.789 --> 09:35.757
Uh, what-- what
my husband is trying to say is

09:35.825 --> 09:37.692
your son was on our property.

09:37.760 --> 09:39.060
And while he was on your property,

09:39.128 --> 09:40.494
he sprained his wrist...

09:40.562 --> 09:41.796
And we had to get an x-ray for it,

09:41.863 --> 09:44.064
- and it cost us $300.
- Mm.

09:44.132 --> 09:45.365
- Wow. Yeah, we're-- we're very sorry about that.
- We're sorry about that.

09:45.434 --> 09:46.567
Yeah.

09:46.635 --> 09:48.569
I want you to pay for the hospital bill.

09:48.637 --> 09:49.937
- Not <i>that</i> sorry.
- Yeah.

09:52.574 --> 09:53.774
Fine.

09:55.009 --> 09:55.909
I'll see you in court.

09:55.976 --> 09:57.176
Oh, come on, Frank.

09:57.244 --> 09:58.377
- Oh, come on.
- Listen, look--

09:58.446 --> 10:01.915
my husband will kick your ass first!

10:07.721 --> 10:10.122
There you are.

10:10.190 --> 10:11.790
I've been waiting for, like, 20 minutes,

10:11.858 --> 10:14.259
and I texted you a lot of frowny faces.

10:15.995 --> 10:17.563
I know. I know. I'm sorry.

10:17.630 --> 10:19.197
I'm just looking over my quiz score.

10:19.265 --> 10:21.266
So this is <i>college,</i> huh?

10:21.334 --> 10:23.469
It's sort of
exactly like high school,

10:23.536 --> 10:25.771
but the girls have let themselves go.

10:28.841 --> 10:30.975
Mandy, I'm a disaster.

10:31.042 --> 10:33.277
Oh, you haven't gained any weight. Nope.

10:33.345 --> 10:34.745
All right. Come on.
You ready? Let's go.

10:34.813 --> 10:36.581
No. Look. Look at my score.

10:36.648 --> 10:39.550
He gave you a "go."

10:39.618 --> 10:41.452
That's a 60.

10:45.189 --> 10:46.155
That's the lowest score

10:46.223 --> 10:48.124
I've ever gotten in my entire life.

10:48.192 --> 10:49.693
Show-off.

10:51.906 --> 10:53.463
No, back in high school,

10:53.531 --> 10:55.966
I was that annoying girl
who had all of the answers,

10:56.033 --> 10:58.635
and now I'm that clueless girl
who puts her head down

10:58.703 --> 11:01.303
and prays that she doesn't
get called on.

11:01.371 --> 11:03.171
Kristin, I have a really good
trick for that, okay?

11:03.239 --> 11:07.109
Say you have bad cramps.
No teacher wants to touch that.

11:09.546 --> 11:10.679
I think I'm gonna quit.

11:10.747 --> 11:13.448
No. Come on. Why?

11:13.517 --> 11:15.083
Because I've been out of the game for three years,

11:15.151 --> 11:19.420
and everyone is smarter
and faster than me.

11:19.488 --> 11:22.757
Look, I'm not
the world's greatest student...

11:22.825 --> 11:25.459
Did somebody accuse you of that?

11:25.528 --> 11:27.461
But there's a lot more to me
than just school,

11:27.530 --> 11:29.230
like how I can look
at what someone's wearing

11:29.297 --> 11:31.232
and tell you why it does or doesn't work

11:31.299 --> 11:33.567
or how I make old people smile.

11:34.969 --> 11:37.037
Mandy, I know you're trying to help,

11:37.104 --> 11:38.805
but I want to be a doctor.

11:38.873 --> 11:41.141
Yeah, and you know what doctors do?

11:41.208 --> 11:44.545
They listen and they're compassionate,

11:44.612 --> 11:47.647
and you're like that
every single day with Boyd.

11:47.714 --> 11:49.849
Yeah, well, that's very sweet,

11:49.917 --> 11:52.952
but Boyd is not gonna help me
pass organic chemistry.

11:53.020 --> 11:56.121
Oh, <i>please!</i> Ohh!
You're such a nerd.

11:56.189 --> 11:58.490
Seriously you're gonna catch up
and pass everybody.

11:58.559 --> 12:01.260
Just thinking about it makes me sick.

12:04.664 --> 12:06.798
Thank you.

12:06.866 --> 12:09.034
Now let's <i>go</i>. Come on.

12:09.101 --> 12:11.803
Ugh. Okay.
Where'd you park?

12:11.871 --> 12:14.405
Oh, right out front.
Left the car with the valet.

12:14.473 --> 12:16.074
No, Mandy.
There is no valet.

12:18.377 --> 12:20.044
There's no valet! Run!

12:22.714 --> 12:24.815
Hey, fellas.

12:24.883 --> 12:26.984
Good-lookin' fin.

12:27.052 --> 12:29.887
Mike Baxter here for Outdoor Man.

12:29.955 --> 12:32.355
Today I want to talk about
accountability and a fishhook.

12:32.423 --> 12:34.391
What do I mean?
Most people look at a fishhook

12:34.459 --> 12:35.825
and they go, "oh, I'll put
a little fishin' line on there

12:35.893 --> 12:37.193
and go fishin',"

12:37.260 --> 12:38.861
but it must be confusing
to some other people,

12:38.929 --> 12:41.330
'cause they put a warning label
on a bag of fishhooks--

12:41.398 --> 12:42.865
"do not swallow."

12:42.933 --> 12:44.601
<i>Really?</i>

12:44.668 --> 12:47.704
You gotta be told not to swallow
these things?

12:47.771 --> 12:49.672
That's a warning?

12:49.740 --> 12:51.540
That's the warning for <i>these</i> things.

12:51.608 --> 12:53.942
<i>They</i> should read that.

12:54.010 --> 12:56.277
What kind of person swallows
one of these?

12:56.345 --> 12:58.513
And mistakes it for what, a garnish?

12:58.581 --> 13:01.182
Instead of going to the emergency room,

13:01.250 --> 13:02.651
tail between your legs...

13:02.719 --> 13:04.019
"Sorry, I got into the cookin' sherry,

13:04.087 --> 13:06.154
and I thought it was a cherry tomato."

13:06.222 --> 13:08.522
No! You morons won't take
responsibility.

13:08.590 --> 13:11.959
You want to sue the manufacturer
of the fishhook?!

13:12.027 --> 13:14.128
Take some responsibility.

13:14.195 --> 13:16.063
You do something stupid,
it's your fault.

13:16.131 --> 13:17.665
And you know what?
If you're that kind of guy

13:17.733 --> 13:19.166
that can't figure out whether
you should eat this

13:19.234 --> 13:23.203
or hook with it,
don't come to Outdoor Man,

13:23.271 --> 13:25.471
'cause we got all sorts of stuff
we don't want you putting

13:25.539 --> 13:27.206
in your mouth around here.

13:27.274 --> 13:29.609
The rest of you, stop down.

13:29.677 --> 13:33.246
We're having a big sale on shotguns.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.949
Great job, Mr. B.

13:36.017 --> 13:36.384
Yeah, thanks.

13:36.504 --> 13:38.752
I didn't know you could sue
over little things like that.

13:38.819 --> 13:40.519
It's a litigious society, Kyle.

13:40.586 --> 13:41.987
You sue over anything--
slippin' on the sidewalk,

13:42.055 --> 13:43.722
fallin' off a ladder.

13:43.790 --> 13:46.058
I fell off a ladder.

13:46.126 --> 13:50.896
Okay. That's just about enough
of that subject.

13:50.964 --> 13:54.733
How about that Madonna?
Can she sing or what, huh?

13:54.801 --> 13:56.534
It was probably my fault, though.

13:56.601 --> 13:58.836
Doesn't matter in today's world
whose fault it is, right, Ed?

13:58.904 --> 14:00.604
Uh, listen, Mike,

14:00.673 --> 14:02.106
we're talking about
Madonna here, all right?

14:02.174 --> 14:03.875
Have-- have you seen her arms?

14:03.942 --> 14:06.343
Looks like the world's strongest bird.

14:11.749 --> 14:13.116
Hey, you know, you're right.

14:13.184 --> 14:15.518
- The live version is totally better.
- Yeah.

14:15.586 --> 14:16.853
Did you just hear the door shut?

14:16.921 --> 14:18.822
What?

14:18.890 --> 14:23.326
She said, "did you just hear the door shut?"

14:32.217 --> 14:34.911
This would be a great time
for an explanation.

14:37.323 --> 14:40.833
You're home early.

14:42.493 --> 14:44.428
That's not an explanation.

14:44.495 --> 14:46.896
You remember Ben.

14:46.964 --> 14:48.465
Hey. Yeah.

14:48.533 --> 14:51.335
Yeah, I-I'd shake your hand,
but I sprained my wrist. Yeah.

14:53.189 --> 14:54.771
Might be a good time for you to go home.

14:54.839 --> 14:56.573
Yes, sir.

14:56.641 --> 14:58.741
Bye.

14:58.809 --> 15:00.075
Why did you lie to me?

15:00.143 --> 15:01.377
How did I lie?

15:01.445 --> 15:02.745
You said you didn't know him.

15:02.813 --> 15:04.480
I... forgot?

15:07.150 --> 15:09.117
And there goes
the other wrist! Ohh!

15:14.890 --> 15:16.424
I don't know why
you have to get so mad, dad.

15:16.492 --> 15:17.925
We didn't do anything.

15:17.993 --> 15:20.094
I'm not mad about that. I'm glad
you didn't do anything,

15:20.162 --> 15:21.863
but you <i>know</i> that kid.

15:21.930 --> 15:23.365
You lied to me.

15:23.432 --> 15:25.333
I-I'm sorry, okay?

15:25.401 --> 15:27.134
No, it's not okay.
You stood in this house,

15:27.202 --> 15:28.536
and you said you didn't know him.

15:28.604 --> 15:30.036
Why did you lie to me?

15:30.104 --> 15:32.406
I don't know.

15:32.474 --> 15:36.377
Does nobody your age know
why they do anything?

15:36.444 --> 15:37.845
You're not gonna like
my answer.

15:37.912 --> 15:39.613
Try me.

15:39.681 --> 15:42.437
I don't know.

15:44.318 --> 15:46.318
Yeah, well, that's too bad.

15:48.455 --> 15:50.556
So what's my punishment?

15:50.624 --> 15:52.992
I don't know.

15:55.962 --> 15:57.663
That's it?

15:57.731 --> 15:58.765
What am I gonna do so I can feel

15:58.832 --> 16:00.199
the same way about you as I did

16:00.267 --> 16:01.831
before I came into this house?

16:10.910 --> 16:12.277
You wanted to see me, sir?

16:12.344 --> 16:14.078
Oh, please, please.

16:14.146 --> 16:16.848
You call me "sir,"
I look around for my father.

16:20.776 --> 16:23.821
My name is Edward,
but you can call me "Ed."

16:23.889 --> 16:25.423
But I've never called you "Ed."

16:25.490 --> 16:28.292
Go on.
Have a seat. Have a seat.

16:28.359 --> 16:30.494
No, have <i>my</i> seat.

16:30.562 --> 16:32.530
There you go.

16:34.365 --> 16:35.498
Oh, this is nice.

16:35.566 --> 16:37.567
Yeah. Huh?
You like it, huh?

16:37.635 --> 16:40.404
Have a cigar. Come on.

16:40.471 --> 16:43.907
Come on, huh? Have that.
There you go.

16:43.975 --> 16:46.476
All right.

16:46.544 --> 16:48.611
Thank you.

16:48.679 --> 16:50.646
Okay.

16:50.713 --> 16:55.151
Kyle, here at Outdoor Man,

16:55.218 --> 16:57.320
we take care of our own, which is why

16:57.387 --> 17:00.089
I'm offering you three nights
at the mile high inn.

17:00.157 --> 17:02.724
It's right near the airport.

17:02.792 --> 17:04.792
Huh?

17:04.861 --> 17:08.195
I do like to watch the planes take off.

17:08.263 --> 17:09.763
I know that, and you can enjoy

17:09.832 --> 17:12.133
the communal hot tub there, right?

17:12.201 --> 17:14.654
And a wide range
of free cable television.

17:15.904 --> 17:18.705
Vibrating mattress.

17:18.773 --> 17:20.842
Wow.

17:20.909 --> 17:23.542
Thanks... Ed.

17:23.611 --> 17:27.381
Uh, but before you go,
I need you to sign this form.

17:27.449 --> 17:28.882
What is it?

17:28.950 --> 17:29.883
Oh, it's nothing.
Just sign.

17:29.951 --> 17:30.884
Should I read it?

17:30.952 --> 17:31.952
I wouldn't.

17:35.023 --> 17:37.524
This looks like a liability waiver.

17:37.592 --> 17:40.346
You want to enjoy the hot tub or not?

17:42.363 --> 17:45.476
Mr. Alzate, are you worried
that I'm gonna sue you?

17:47.968 --> 17:49.235
Well...

17:49.303 --> 17:52.372
I would never do that, sir.

17:52.439 --> 17:54.072
I think of you like family...

17:56.409 --> 17:59.211
Like a father.

18:03.216 --> 18:05.517
Kyle.

18:05.584 --> 18:08.353
I'm feeling something
I don't often feel...

18:14.226 --> 18:16.093
Shame.

18:16.161 --> 18:17.794
Here. Here.

18:17.862 --> 18:19.196
Enjoy the motel.

18:19.264 --> 18:20.731
- Go and have some fun. Go.
- That's not necessary.

18:20.798 --> 18:23.767
Please. I insist, and take
my chair, too. Go ahead.

18:25.137 --> 18:26.169
You're giving me your chair?

18:26.237 --> 18:27.337
Oh, no. H-here. Here.

18:27.405 --> 18:28.538
Here are the keys. Go on.

18:28.605 --> 18:31.441
You're giving me your car?

18:31.509 --> 18:33.576
In the trunk,
there's a set of golf clubs.

18:33.644 --> 18:35.026
You can use those.
Go ahead.

18:36.280 --> 18:37.680
I don't golf.

18:37.748 --> 18:40.448
I'll teach you, son.

18:48.091 --> 18:50.359
Hey. You wanted to see me?

18:50.427 --> 18:52.227
Yeah. Um, come on in.

18:52.295 --> 18:54.696
Sit down, okay, Eve?

18:56.899 --> 18:58.632
Listen, I'm just gonna ask you

18:58.700 --> 19:00.000
one more time why you lied to me,

19:00.069 --> 19:01.936
and "I don't know"--

19:02.003 --> 19:03.804
that's not an answer.

19:03.872 --> 19:05.506
Because Ben was the ding dong ditcher,

19:05.574 --> 19:07.408
and you would have hated him.

19:07.476 --> 19:10.878
Wow. Well, you're probably right, too...

19:12.347 --> 19:15.115
'Cause that is, like, the lamest prank.

19:15.183 --> 19:17.084
You know, you're doing what
the pizza guy does.

19:17.151 --> 19:18.518
Come up and ring the doorbell.

19:18.586 --> 19:20.753
"Gotcha!"

19:20.821 --> 19:24.458
That was just his signal
that he wanted to see me.

19:24.525 --> 19:27.227
Why didn't he just throw
pebbles against your window?

19:27.295 --> 19:29.796
Uh, he doesn't have the arm.

19:32.031 --> 19:37.303
That kid is a disappointment
on many levels.

19:37.370 --> 19:40.839
Then I didn't come clean because...

19:40.907 --> 19:43.344
I know I'm your favorite.

19:46.212 --> 19:49.414
I-I wanted to be the person
you thought I was.

19:49.482 --> 19:50.982
I have three girls. I...

19:51.049 --> 19:53.284
I don't have any favorites.

19:54.853 --> 19:57.149
You're still my favorite.

19:58.924 --> 20:00.825
Are we okay?

20:00.892 --> 20:02.493
There's still a punishment
involved, though.

20:02.560 --> 20:03.760
What?

20:03.828 --> 20:05.429
I want you to pay for his hospital bill.

20:05.497 --> 20:09.495
That's $300, and he got hurt
because of your air horn.

20:12.303 --> 20:14.638
All right.

20:14.705 --> 20:17.241
We'll go halves, counselor.
Is that fair?

20:17.308 --> 20:19.041
That sounds fair.

20:19.109 --> 20:21.757
It is...
'Cause you're my favorite.

20:24.581 --> 20:26.182
And you know what?
You want to play a prank

20:26.250 --> 20:29.452
on somebody, ask the master, you know?

20:29.520 --> 20:31.787
We'll get a paper bag and some matches,

20:31.855 --> 20:34.222

20:54.129 --> 20:57.798

21:12.813 --> 21:14.781

21:25.525 --> 21:28.628
