00:02.003 --> 00:03.368
Previously on Lost:

00:03.462 --> 00:05.327
- Let me ask you something.
- Anything.

00:05.423 --> 00:07.209
How'd you know Claire was drowning?

00:20.605 --> 00:21.811
Claire!

00:21.898 --> 00:25.857
[chuckles] I could hear her
calling for help.

00:26.110 --> 00:29.318
You hear the lightning as well?

00:38.456 --> 00:40.321
[baby cries]

00:44.086 --> 00:48.170
[Desmond] I wasn't saving Claire,
Charlie. I was saving you.

00:49.133 --> 00:54.378
When I saw the lightning hit the roof,
you were electrocuted.

00:54.472 --> 00:58.260
And when you heard Claire
was in the water, you...

00:58.351 --> 01:01.218
You drowned trying to save her.

01:01.312 --> 01:04.896
I've tried, brother,
I've tried twice to save you, but...

01:04.982 --> 01:06.483
No matter what I try to do...

01:09.153 --> 01:11.565
...you're gonna die, Charlie.

01:24.835 --> 01:26.211
[Charlie] You're insane, mate.

01:26.671 --> 01:31.131
Superman can fly around the
entire planet in the blink of an eye.

01:31.217 --> 01:34.129
Dude, if we're going by
a pure foot race,

01:34.220 --> 01:36.085
Supes would get dusted by the Flash.

01:36.180 --> 01:40.219
Why would the Man of Steel
agree to a sodding foot race?

01:40.518 --> 01:42.554
For charity.

01:42.645 --> 01:46.888
And Flash would totally win, because
he can vibrate through walls and stuff.

01:46.983 --> 01:51.477
Vibration! Whatever would Superman do
if he came up against a wall?

01:51.570 --> 01:53.526
Well, no smashing allowed.

01:54.031 --> 01:57.774
No flying, no smashing... Any other
restrictions I need to know about?

01:57.868 --> 02:00.860
Perhaps we should fit Superman
with a pair of kryptonite...

02:03.332 --> 02:04.367
What the hell?

02:08.713 --> 02:09.793
[choking]

02:09.880 --> 02:10.960
Charlie!

02:12.800 --> 02:14.791
- Don't touch it!
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

02:14.885 --> 02:15.920
Just breathe...

02:16.846 --> 02:19.053
Don't try to talk.
We've got to get him back.

02:19.140 --> 02:20.846
- No! You help!
- I can't help!

02:20.933 --> 02:22.798
[gasping]

02:23.144 --> 02:24.509
I'm sorry, mate.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.575
[distorted echoes]

02:47.752 --> 02:50.459
[Charlie] Superman can fly
around the entire planet.

03:03.934 --> 03:05.470
[survivors chatter]

03:22.828 --> 03:25.911
Hey! Where's the wire?

03:27.124 --> 03:29.536
You eat those mushrooms
Jack warned us about?

03:29.627 --> 03:33.540
Listen to me. There's a wire,
a cable, buried in the sand.

03:35.091 --> 03:36.922
Do you know what I'm talking about?

03:37.676 --> 03:41.168
- This is future crap, isn't it?
- The cable! Do you know where it is?

03:42.807 --> 03:45.389
- This is important.
- Why?

03:47.895 --> 03:50.102
- [Charlie] Superman.
- [distorted echoes]

03:54.985 --> 03:56.771
Because someone's coming.

04:17.508 --> 04:17.542
[bells tolling]

04:17.550 --> 04:20.667
[bells tolling]

04:50.374 --> 04:52.956
God tests our faith in many ways.

04:53.043 --> 04:56.956
As you well know,
we have our own test here.

04:57.047 --> 05:01.290
A vow of silence that lasts
as long as we see fit.

05:01.385 --> 05:07.381
This challenges both
one's patience and his faith.

05:07.600 --> 05:10.808
For some it may last a week,

05:10.895 --> 05:14.058
those we're less sure about, a month.

05:14.982 --> 05:17.314
Personally, Desmond,

05:17.401 --> 05:19.687
I never thought you'd last.

05:21.906 --> 05:24.113
And so now I stand corrected.

05:25.576 --> 05:29.990
For whatever reason,
your path has led you here.

05:32.333 --> 05:33.869
And now you're one of us.

05:37.922 --> 05:39.503
Welcome, brother.

05:40.466 --> 05:45.085
Thank you... brother.

05:51.852 --> 05:52.841
Morning, Jack.

05:57.566 --> 05:59.431
Must be nice to wake up
in your own bed.

06:00.069 --> 06:02.856
Yeah. Home sweet home.

06:04.240 --> 06:07.448
Listen, I was wondering if I could
borrow your first aid kit.

06:09.119 --> 06:12.077
I've twisted my ankle.

06:16.210 --> 06:18.997
- You want me to take a look at it?
- No, you're all right.

06:19.713 --> 06:23.171
- I've taped my share of ankles.
- Right.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.048
Thanks.

06:31.976 --> 06:34.058
Something wrong, Hurley?

06:34.144 --> 06:38.888
No, just keeping Desmond company...

06:40.985 --> 06:42.691
...because we're friends.

06:44.989 --> 06:47.571
- Bring that back when you're done.
- Absolutely.

06:50.661 --> 06:53.903
What the hell was that?
Do you want him to get suspicious?

06:53.998 --> 06:55.033
Suspicious of what?

06:57.334 --> 06:59.711
This is like when
you knew Claire was drowning.

06:59.795 --> 07:03.128
That's why you got the first aid kit,
someone's gonna get hurt.

07:03.215 --> 07:06.002
- Is it me?
- No. This is just a precaution.

07:06.093 --> 07:09.961
Look, dude, you want me to take you
to the wire, I want an explanation.

07:19.356 --> 07:23.850
I saw a sequence of events.
Things that are gonna happen.

07:24.194 --> 07:29.780
- What'd you see?
- It was like a jigsaw puzzle.

07:29.867 --> 07:32.324
Only I didn't have
the picture on the box,

07:32.411 --> 07:34.697
so I don't know how
the pieces fit, exactly.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.619
One of the pieces, the first one...

07:40.544 --> 07:43.661
It was you pulling the cable
out of the sand.

07:46.383 --> 07:47.919
So what're the other pieces?

07:48.552 --> 07:52.136
If I tell you that,
it'll change the picture on the box.

07:52.222 --> 07:57.012
So what? Isn't that the point?
Preventing something bad?

07:57.811 --> 07:59.142
Not this time.

07:59.229 --> 08:02.016
So you're not trying to stop
something from happening.

08:03.525 --> 08:05.231
You actually want it to happen?

08:15.996 --> 08:17.702
More than anything.

08:27.716 --> 08:29.877
Hey, Freckles, you home?

08:30.636 --> 08:33.218
[Kate] Thought you weren't
allowed to use nicknames.

08:33.305 --> 08:38.516
You weren't around
when I lost the bet, so you're...

08:41.188 --> 08:42.177
...exempt.

08:47.861 --> 08:51.854
- What's up?
- I wanted to ask you something.

08:51.949 --> 08:53.109
Yeah?

08:55.369 --> 08:56.700
I'm up here.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.449
Did you tell him?

09:04.002 --> 09:05.788
Did I tell who, What?

09:05.879 --> 09:11.374
You know, did you tell the doc
about you and me?

09:14.304 --> 09:17.592
No. But he knows.

09:18.142 --> 09:20.679
He saw us on one of their
surveillance monitors.

09:20.769 --> 09:24.182
- You said the camera was broken.
- Well, they had another camera.

09:24.648 --> 09:26.479
Those perverts.

09:26.775 --> 09:28.891
Anyway, he knows.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.686
Well, now that that's out of the way...

09:34.199 --> 09:36.781
How about a little afternoon delight?

09:40.456 --> 09:42.242
- That means sex.
- I know.

09:42.332 --> 09:43.663
Come on, Freckles, wait!

09:44.585 --> 09:47.998
- You need me to make you a mix tape?
- Yeah, why don't you do that.

09:56.054 --> 09:58.340
Dude, you're gonna
have to tell me again.

09:58.432 --> 10:02.095
- What do we need Jin for?
- Because he was there with us.

10:02.186 --> 10:04.848
On the beach, when I find the cable.

10:05.814 --> 10:06.849
This way.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.100
Here it is!

10:08.192 --> 10:11.434
- That's right.
- In one of your puzzle flashes.

10:12.613 --> 10:14.820
Aye.

10:16.533 --> 10:19.650
So if he doesn't come,

10:19.745 --> 10:23.363
then neither does the "someone"
you won't tell me anything about.

10:23.457 --> 10:25.448
That'd be the long and short of it.

10:28.670 --> 10:32.128
But I have no bloody idea how
I'm gonna get him to come with us.

10:33.008 --> 10:34.088
Watch the master.

10:41.225 --> 10:44.809
- Camping?
- Yeah, sleeping under the stars,

10:44.895 --> 10:46.977
a fire on the beach...

10:47.064 --> 10:48.600
Marshmallows.

10:49.733 --> 10:52.145
Camping.

10:58.534 --> 11:01.651
- Yes.
- Everybody likes marshmallows.

11:02.246 --> 11:05.864
Good man. Get food, water...

11:05.958 --> 11:08.745
- Where are you going?
- We need one more.

11:11.296 --> 11:13.673
How daft do you think I am?

11:13.757 --> 11:19.002
This isn't a camping trip.
You've had another vision, haven't you?

11:21.265 --> 11:22.425
What was it this time?

11:25.227 --> 11:26.967
Someone's coming to the island.

11:27.938 --> 11:30.930
"Coming?" As in someone
who's not already here?

11:31.024 --> 11:32.355
How is that gonna happen?

11:34.444 --> 11:35.479
I can't tell you.

11:38.323 --> 11:40.029
It's got nothing to do with me?

11:40.117 --> 11:43.109
Well, you're a part of it,
as are Jin and Hurley.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.818
Right, but with all due respect,

11:44.913 --> 11:48.280
you haven't previously told Jin
or Hurley that they're gonna die.

11:51.336 --> 11:53.918
Well, that's not gonna happen.
Not this time.

12:01.805 --> 12:03.261
Can I bring my guitar?

12:04.600 --> 12:06.056
Absolutely.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.312
All right, I'm in.

12:10.939 --> 12:12.679
You had me worried for a second.

12:22.326 --> 12:25.614
[Jâ€˜ whistling The Colonel Bogey March I]

12:43.680 --> 12:44.669
This is it!

12:47.559 --> 12:49.265
Well, how can you tell?

12:49.353 --> 12:52.140
That's where I followed
the wire into the jungle.

12:52.689 --> 12:54.020
Where is it then?

12:55.692 --> 12:56.681
[speaks in Korean]

12:57.945 --> 12:59.151
Way to go, dude!

13:03.200 --> 13:04.531
Here it is!

13:06.536 --> 13:07.525
[distorted echoes]

13:07.621 --> 13:08.610
Here it is!

13:10.540 --> 13:13.668
Just one thing. Last time I followed
this wire into the jungle,

13:13.752 --> 13:17.119
I almost got kebabbed by one of
Rousseau's spiky deathtrap things.

13:20.801 --> 13:23.793
We're not going into the jungle.
Well, not yet.

13:23.887 --> 13:27.880
It's getting late.
So we'll camp here the night.

13:28.392 --> 13:30.053
Camp.

13:33.563 --> 13:35.019
So when do they get here?

13:36.274 --> 13:38.265
Your mysterious someone?

13:39.653 --> 13:40.642
Soon.

13:49.663 --> 13:52.746
You do realize you are free
to talk again, Brother Desmond.

13:56.086 --> 13:58.077
Used to being quiet, I suppose.

13:59.881 --> 14:01.496
Moriah.

14:02.551 --> 14:06.590
I find the name the brothers
have chosen for the wine made here...

14:08.098 --> 14:11.135
-...interesting.
- And why is that, brother?

14:11.226 --> 14:14.684
Well, Moriah is the mountain where
Abraham was asked to kill Isaac.

14:16.356 --> 14:20.019
It's not the exactly the most
festive locale, is it?

14:20.110 --> 14:22.396
And yet God spared Isaac.

14:22.946 --> 14:26.109
Well, one might argue that
God need not have asked

14:26.199 --> 14:28.736
Abraham to sacrifice his son
in the first place.

14:30.037 --> 14:33.370
Then it wouldn't have been
much of a test, would it, brother?

14:33.874 --> 14:36.786
Perhaps you underestimate
the value of sacrifice.

14:38.045 --> 14:41.629
[Monk] Brother Desmond,
I met this man down by the gates.

14:41.715 --> 14:43.706
Says he needs to have a word with you.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.006
[grunts]

14:50.140 --> 14:51.505
Sorry, sir.

15:00.692 --> 15:02.353
Forgive me, brother.

15:18.877 --> 15:21.368
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:22.881 --> 15:25.793
- The oatmeal's awesome.
- It is, huh?

15:29.179 --> 15:32.717
- It's strange, huh?
- What's that?

15:33.183 --> 15:38.598
Being back. Not looking
for a way out of a cage.

15:38.688 --> 15:42.681
Not finding a reason to go running
off into the jungle again.

15:42.776 --> 15:45.233
I almost don't know
what to do with myself.

15:46.071 --> 15:50.110
Well, enjoy it. I'm sure something
will go wrong soon enough.

15:54.329 --> 15:58.447
Well, my big,
dangerous adventure for tonight

15:58.542 --> 16:01.830
is gonna be doing the dishes...
in the ocean.

16:02.796 --> 16:05.378
- Be careful.
- I'll try.

16:08.385 --> 16:11.877
- Can I borrow that spoon?
- Yeah.

16:19.062 --> 16:20.051
Thanks.

16:28.822 --> 16:31.279
- Good night.
- Yeah, good night.

17:00.312 --> 17:02.394
What, my doorbell busted again?

17:04.608 --> 17:08.817
- What the hell are you doing?
- Shut up and don't talk.

17:18.121 --> 17:21.534
- You crying?
- I said shut up.

17:28.048 --> 17:29.208
You got it.

17:48.652 --> 17:52.520
[guitar music]

17:52.614 --> 17:54.354
[speaking in Korean]

18:15.512 --> 18:16.797
[screams]

18:16.888 --> 18:18.389
[all laugh]

18:22.978 --> 18:26.937
[Hurley] Dude, I love the part
about the bird. There was a bird, right?

18:27.023 --> 18:29.730
[Jin] You.
[Hurley] Me? OK...

18:30.485 --> 18:33.943
Have you heard the one
about the Chupacabra?

18:34.030 --> 18:35.531
Chupa...?

18:35.615 --> 18:39.449
Yeah, it's like this bear
with spines, but Mexican...

18:39.536 --> 18:40.525
Thanks.

18:42.956 --> 18:43.991
Who's that?

18:52.299 --> 18:53.755
Her name's Penny.

18:54.634 --> 18:57.546
That's not bad, Des.
Not bad at all.

18:57.637 --> 19:01.255
So how did you manage to
leave her behind and come here?

19:04.269 --> 19:06.385
Because I'm a coward.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.144
Sorry.

19:09.941 --> 19:11.602
You and me both, pal.

19:13.737 --> 19:16.900
You know, I tried to run away from her,
and she tracked me down.

19:19.034 --> 19:23.744
"With enough money and determination,
you can find anyone," she said.

19:25.707 --> 19:30.667
I used to get through my nights
thinking that she actually meant it,

19:30.754 --> 19:33.086
that she never gave up.

19:34.299 --> 19:36.915
That, maybe, she spent
the last three years...

19:38.428 --> 19:40.168
...looking for me.

19:46.936 --> 19:48.142
[helicopter sounds]

19:49.272 --> 19:50.432
What's that?

20:03.161 --> 20:05.777
- Is that a helicopter?
- Rescue!

20:10.627 --> 20:12.242
[engine sputters]

20:14.506 --> 20:17.122
Uh, is that how a helicopter's
supposed to sound?

20:19.135 --> 20:20.295
No.

20:28.478 --> 20:32.062
[splash]

20:41.366 --> 20:42.572
We gotta go out there.

20:42.659 --> 20:44.524
- Out there?
- Well, yeah.

20:44.619 --> 20:47.156
- In what?
- Well, we gotta do something!

20:49.165 --> 20:50.154
[Jin] Look!

20:51.418 --> 20:52.407
Look!

21:06.516 --> 21:08.507
Oh, my God.

21:15.024 --> 21:17.276
- Pallet?
- Nah, dude. It's not a food drop.

21:17.360 --> 21:20.067
You saw the beacon thing.
Someone, like, ejected.

21:20.155 --> 21:23.443
But that was a helicopter.
You can't eject from a helicopter.

21:23.533 --> 21:27.117
Well, maybe theyjumped.
All that matters is that they're here.

21:27.203 --> 21:29.114
They?
How do we even know it's a person?

21:29.205 --> 21:31.161
Because he said "someone" was coming.

21:34.210 --> 21:37.953
- Where're you going?
- Out to where it fell. Let's go.

21:38.047 --> 21:41.289
No. Whoa, slow down.
We're not going into the jungle

21:41.384 --> 21:43.625
- in the middle of the night.
- Yes, we are.

21:44.220 --> 21:48.054
Were you even listening to Hurley when
he mentioned Rousseau's deathtrap?

21:48.141 --> 21:50.632
It's gonna be light in two hours,
we'll wait...

21:50.727 --> 21:53.764
- She can't wait!
- "She?"

21:53.855 --> 21:57.063
They! Whoever it is, could be hurt.

21:57.734 --> 21:59.565
We have to go, all four of us. Now.

22:00.069 --> 22:01.400
VVhy?

22:01.488 --> 22:04.195
Because that's the way
it's supposed to happen.

22:06.993 --> 22:09.951
Right, well, I guess it's
supposed to happen without me.

22:13.750 --> 22:14.830
[distorted echoes]

22:28.473 --> 22:30.464
We'll leave at first light, then.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.012
Together.

22:36.523 --> 22:37.729
Terrific.

22:42.403 --> 22:43.859
[knocking]

22:46.199 --> 22:47.564
Is your sister in?

22:49.827 --> 22:52.739
Leave. Now.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.914
Let him be, Derek.

23:02.924 --> 23:04.505
Hello, Ruth.

23:09.097 --> 23:10.587
So you're a monk now, are you?

23:10.682 --> 23:14.266
Well, technically, I'm still
a novice till the Abbot says...

23:14.352 --> 23:15.683
Why are you here, Desmond?

23:18.606 --> 23:20.688
Now that my initiation's done...

23:22.652 --> 23:24.608
I felt like I owed you an explanation.

23:25.530 --> 23:31.491
Desmond, you could never begin
to explain what you did.

23:32.287 --> 23:34.369
You left one week before the wedding.

23:34.455 --> 23:37.071
Everything was planned,
bought and paid for.

23:37.166 --> 23:39.908
You just disappeared completely.

23:40.003 --> 23:41.959
I had a calling.

23:42.046 --> 23:45.630
We dated for six years
and the closest you ever came

23:45.717 --> 23:49.050
to a religious experience
was Celtic winning the Cup.

23:49.137 --> 23:52.925
Look, yes,
I was scared about the wedding.

23:53.016 --> 23:58.306
So I had a few pints
too many maybe, and I...

23:58.396 --> 24:01.513
I raised my eyes and I asked,

24:01.608 --> 24:04.941
"Am I doing the right thing?"

24:05.028 --> 24:07.895
And that's the last thing I remember.

24:07.989 --> 24:11.777
When I woke up, I was lying
on my back in the street,

24:11.868 --> 24:13.904
and I don't know how I got there.

24:13.995 --> 24:17.863
And there was this man
standing over me, Ruth.

24:18.333 --> 24:23.293
And he reached out his hand
and he said to me,

24:23.379 --> 24:24.994
"Can I help you, brother?"

24:25.715 --> 24:29.173
And the first thing I noticed was
the rope tied around his waist.

24:30.678 --> 24:36.674
I looked at him and I knew.
I knew I was supposed to go with him.

24:38.102 --> 24:43.472
I was supposed to leave
everything that mattered behind...

24:45.109 --> 24:49.569
Sacrifice all of it
for a greater calling.

24:53.576 --> 24:57.364
Well, it's a good thing
a bloody shepherd didn't help you up,

24:57.455 --> 25:00.322
or I suppose you'd be off
with the sheep, wouldn't ya?

25:03.294 --> 25:08.834
Next time you want to break up with
someone, Des, don't join a monastery.

25:09.926 --> 25:13.794
Just tell the girl
you're too bloody scared.

25:23.064 --> 25:24.554
You a doctor or a carpenter?

25:24.649 --> 25:27.482
What, your dad never taught you
to use a hammer?

25:28.277 --> 25:30.268
No, my dad taught me how to drink.

25:30.738 --> 25:32.239
Well, it's something.

25:35.034 --> 25:37.025
Hope I'm not interrupting.

25:37.870 --> 25:40.452
You two arguing over
who's your favorite Other?

25:40.540 --> 25:42.405
What do you want, Sawyer?

25:43.126 --> 25:45.037
What I wanted, Doc, was to inform you

25:45.128 --> 25:47.665
there's been developments
since you were AWOL.

25:49.757 --> 25:50.746
So tell me...

25:54.721 --> 25:56.461
How's your backhand?

25:59.308 --> 26:00.764
Where'd you get the table?

26:00.852 --> 26:04.936
Don't you recognize it? Fell out of the
purple haze after the hatch went blammo.

26:06.315 --> 26:10.433
If we don't play every 108 minutes,
the island's gonna explode.

26:12.488 --> 26:14.820
Finally. Something I can beat you at.

26:17.285 --> 26:20.243
You know, considering
I haven't played since I was 12,

26:20.329 --> 26:22.490
I wouldn't be too proud.

26:23.916 --> 26:25.656
What is that, 18 point?

26:28.087 --> 26:31.625
It's kinda strange, huh? Being back.

26:33.676 --> 26:35.177
Something funny?

26:35.970 --> 26:38.427
Kate said the same thing
in the kitchen last night.

26:40.016 --> 26:42.257
- She did, huh?
- She did.

26:45.521 --> 26:46.681
Nineteen point.

26:51.152 --> 26:52.813
So you guys ate together, huh?

26:53.237 --> 26:55.819
No, Juliet and I
had dinner together last night.

27:07.668 --> 27:11.661
- Best two out of three?
- You got it.

27:15.760 --> 27:18.251
[Charlie] So what's next?
[Desmond] Next?

27:18.346 --> 27:21.759
Yeah, you saw the wire, the
flashy thing falling out of the sky...

27:21.849 --> 27:23.931
Now what?
Maybe I can help you find...

27:24.018 --> 27:27.306
That's it. There is no "next."

27:27.396 --> 27:29.182
We find the beacon.

27:29.273 --> 27:31.855
- Why are you lying to me, mate?
- Look, mate...

27:32.527 --> 27:34.483
I've saved your life three times now.

27:34.570 --> 27:37.403
If that hasn't bought me your trust,
don't know what will.

27:39.200 --> 27:40.189
Let's move.

27:50.294 --> 27:53.627
Dude, seriously,
I'm gonna have a coronary.

27:53.714 --> 27:56.376
Actually, you're not.
And if you don't get a move on,

27:56.467 --> 27:59.800
- we're not gonna make it...
- Hey! Look at this!

28:01.597 --> 28:02.882
[Jin speaks in Korean]

28:03.015 --> 28:05.347
Can't be Rousseau's.
If it was Rousseau's,

28:05.434 --> 28:08.050
a massive rock would be
flying at my head right now.

28:10.106 --> 28:11.141
Don't move.

28:11.232 --> 28:13.188
- What are you doing...
- Don't move.

28:13.276 --> 28:14.311
Ow!

28:21.492 --> 28:24.484
Did that come down with
the flashing red light thingy?

28:28.124 --> 28:29.159
Walkie-talkie?

28:31.878 --> 28:34.540
No, dude, that's a satellite phone!

28:38.718 --> 28:41.505
- Crap. It's dead.
- Shocker.

28:48.853 --> 28:50.263
Oh, my God.

28:50.897 --> 28:52.228
Is that you?

28:57.194 --> 28:58.525
Then who is she?

28:59.947 --> 29:02.404
That would be Penny.

29:19.842 --> 29:22.424
- What's this?
- Your mix tape.

29:27.183 --> 29:29.174
Well, you gonna take it, or ain't ya?

29:31.354 --> 29:33.094
The Best of Phil Collins, huh?

29:33.189 --> 29:36.147
Don't get picky.
And if Bernard asks,

29:36.233 --> 29:39.066
- I don't know a thing about it.
- Thanks, James.

29:41.072 --> 29:43.063
So why'd you jump me last night?

29:44.533 --> 29:45.909
What?

29:45.993 --> 29:48.450
Because you saw the doc
hanging out with Juliet?

29:51.040 --> 29:53.622
- It is not like that.
- It's not?

29:55.795 --> 30:00.505
You ain't gotta use me, Freckles.
All you gotta do is ask.

30:12.019 --> 30:15.807
- You think it's her, don't you?
- Who?

30:17.066 --> 30:19.773
Your girl, Penny.

30:20.569 --> 30:23.732
You think it's actually her
who bailed out of the helicopter.

30:24.323 --> 30:26.314
Earlier I hoped it.

30:26.409 --> 30:28.365
Now I know it.

30:32.331 --> 30:33.537
Why didn't you tell us?

30:34.333 --> 30:38.246
- Would you've come if I had?
- Of course. Why wouldn't I?

30:40.089 --> 30:42.250
I didn't want to tell you because...

30:43.384 --> 30:45.420
...I didn't want anything to change.

30:46.137 --> 30:47.126
Fair enough.

30:48.055 --> 30:51.764
Look, if whatever you're seeing
leads to your girl getting us rescued,

30:51.851 --> 30:54.433
why would we want to
change anything? Right?

30:55.938 --> 30:56.927
Right.

31:05.531 --> 31:06.520
Right.

31:12.371 --> 31:15.408
Thanks for the heads-up about
bringing an umbrella, dude.

31:25.051 --> 31:29.966
[Desmond sings: The Celtic Song]
I It's a grand old team to play for

31:32.683 --> 31:36.722
Jâ€˜ And itâ€™s a grand old team to see

31:36.812 --> 31:41.681
Jâ€˜ And if you know your history...

31:41.776 --> 31:43.812
[Brother Campbell] Brother Desmond...

31:43.903 --> 31:45.313
What are you doing?

31:46.280 --> 31:50.398
Well, I believe I'm getting pissed
on our lovely wine.

31:51.911 --> 31:55.495
That bottle of our lovely wine
fetches over a hundred quid.

31:56.373 --> 31:59.115
We've only bottled
a 108 cases this year.

32:00.211 --> 32:03.578
It's just as well we've taken
a vow of poverty then, isn't it?

32:03.672 --> 32:06.334
We've also taken a vow of charity.

32:08.761 --> 32:10.092
Aye.

32:19.563 --> 32:23.306
Something tells me, Desmond,
that you're not cut out to be a monk.

32:24.235 --> 32:26.897
Well, you know,
I've had a tough week.

32:34.036 --> 32:38.655
I'm sorry for the wine.
I'll take the penance.

32:39.875 --> 32:42.207
I'm afraid you're
beyond penance, Desmond.

32:43.629 --> 32:45.415
Brother Desmond.

32:46.549 --> 32:48.039
Not anymore.

32:51.303 --> 32:53.294
Are you... Are you firing me?

32:53.389 --> 32:54.879
I am indeed.

32:57.017 --> 32:59.554
You can't do that. I heard the call.

32:59.645 --> 33:01.306
I'm sure you did hear the call.

33:01.397 --> 33:04.355
But the Abbey, clearly,
isn't where you're meant to end up.

33:04.775 --> 33:07.482
I have little doubt
that God has different plans

33:07.570 --> 33:10.312
than you being a monk, Desmond.
Bigger plans.

33:10.406 --> 33:11.691
Oh, I'm sure he does.

33:11.782 --> 33:15.946
He does. You've just spent
too much time running away

33:16.036 --> 33:18.869
to realize what you
may be running toward.

33:31.760 --> 33:32.840
Hey!

33:37.892 --> 33:39.507
What am I supposed to do now?

33:41.312 --> 33:43.268
Whatever comes next.

33:57.411 --> 33:58.491
Who's Penny?

33:59.288 --> 34:01.449
She's a chick Desmond used to date.

34:01.749 --> 34:03.740
Now he thinks she fell from the sky.

34:03.834 --> 34:07.122
So we're gonna go save her life,
and she's gonna get us rescued.

34:12.927 --> 34:15.714
Even if I spoke Korean,
it wouldn't make any sense.

34:15.804 --> 34:19.763
Hey, we'll move faster
if we stop talking. She might be hurt.

34:20.226 --> 34:22.217
I'm moving as fast as I can.

34:22.311 --> 34:25.303
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm not exactly the Flash.

34:25.648 --> 34:27.479
The Flash is pathetic.

34:28.192 --> 34:30.729
You got something against
the fastest man alive?

34:31.528 --> 34:32.654
You're insane, mate.

34:32.738 --> 34:36.401
Superman can fly around the
entire planet in the blink of an eye.

34:36.492 --> 34:38.824
Dude, if we're going by
a pure foot race,

34:38.911 --> 34:40.867
Supes would get dusted by the Flash.

34:40.955 --> 34:44.322
Why would the Man of Steel
agree to a sodding foot race?

34:44.416 --> 34:45.917
For charity?

34:46.001 --> 34:49.710
Flash would totally win, because
he can vibrate through walls and stuff.

34:49.797 --> 34:53.289
Vibration! And what would Superman do
if he came up against a wall?

34:53.384 --> 34:55.170
Well, no smashing allowed.

34:57.471 --> 34:59.757
No flying, no smashing.

34:59.848 --> 35:02.180
Any other restrictions
I need to know about?

35:03.936 --> 35:07.929
Perhaps we should fit Superman with
a pair of kryptonite ballet slippers.

35:10.693 --> 35:11.682
What the hell?

35:13.404 --> 35:14.439
Charlie, duck!

35:27.126 --> 35:28.206
Dude...

35:39.722 --> 35:40.711
This way.

35:42.391 --> 35:44.632
No, the beacon fell
this side of the rise.

35:44.727 --> 35:45.887
No, there!

35:46.812 --> 35:49.645
How about we split up?
Me and Charlie will go that way.

35:49.732 --> 35:53.065
You and Jin go around, and we'll
meet up at that ridge over there.

35:53.152 --> 35:56.144
You and Jin. I'll stick with Desmond.

36:07.541 --> 36:08.621
You said "duck."

36:09.626 --> 36:12.038
- Sorry?
- You shouted "duck."

36:14.006 --> 36:18.124
You knew, even before we set off.
You knew all this time, didn't you?

36:18.218 --> 36:20.470
- Aye.
- Why didn't you say anything?

36:20.554 --> 36:23.045
If I'd told you the truth,
you wouldn't have come.

36:23.140 --> 36:26.678
And you needed me to come...
because I was part of your vision.

36:26.769 --> 36:31.809
You thought the way you could get your
girl was if I took an arrow in the head.

36:31.899 --> 36:35.062
- You were gonna sacrifice me!
- If the flashes don't happen

36:35.152 --> 36:38.110
exactly how I saw them,
the picture changes.

36:40.157 --> 36:42.364
I was supposed to let you die, Charlie.

36:42.451 --> 36:46.114
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means it's bloody pointless!

36:47.331 --> 36:50.118
I keep saving your life.
And what good has it done?

36:50.292 --> 36:54.706
It's going to keep happening. Maybe
that's the point? Maybe it's a test.

36:54.797 --> 36:57.539
- A test?
- Like God testing Abraham!

36:57.633 --> 37:01.751
Except I failed.
Because I changed what I saw.

37:03.555 --> 37:05.967
[Jin shouts in Korean]

37:17.569 --> 37:20.481
Hey! Hey, can you hear me?

37:20.572 --> 37:22.187
Hello!

37:26.912 --> 37:28.368
Dude, she's not moving.

37:31.708 --> 37:35.621
I'm sorry, Penny. I'm sorry.

37:40.759 --> 37:41.794
[knocking]

37:50.310 --> 37:52.847
I was afraid you'd left
without saying goodbye.

37:52.938 --> 37:54.348
No.

37:56.859 --> 37:58.895
I nearly took this with me.

38:03.323 --> 38:04.608
If you're not in a hurry,

38:04.700 --> 38:08.443
Brother Martin's heading into town
in a few hours. He can give you a ride.

38:09.538 --> 38:12.575
That is, if you don't mind
doing some heavy lifting.

38:15.043 --> 38:17.170
All ten cases are ready to go.

38:17.546 --> 38:20.128
Desmond, there,
is just getting the last one.

38:20.215 --> 38:22.831
Thank you, and my father
sent the check in advance.

38:22.926 --> 38:25.383
Please thank him for his
generous donation.

38:25.471 --> 38:27.382
Always a pleasure to see you.

38:30.893 --> 38:32.133
Goodbye, Desmond.

38:39.526 --> 38:41.983
[Penny] We should be able
to fit it all in the back,

38:42.070 --> 38:44.152
and if not, we'll
put the rest in the front.

38:46.617 --> 38:47.732
Is that all right?

38:50.162 --> 38:51.322
Absolutely.

39:03.759 --> 39:05.465
You'd better drive safe, Miss.

39:06.220 --> 39:09.678
This vineyard only makes a limited
number of these cases each year.

39:09.765 --> 39:13.428
[Penny] Is that so?
[Desmond] Because the monks are lazy.

39:14.603 --> 39:17.185
It's easier making
grape jelly than wine.

39:17.898 --> 39:19.854
And how do you know
so much about monks?

39:19.942 --> 39:22.354
- Because I'm an ex-monk.
- Really?

39:22.444 --> 39:25.902
As of last night. I was fired.

39:25.989 --> 39:27.650
Uaughs]

39:28.450 --> 39:30.190
Oh, it wasn't that funny.

39:30.285 --> 39:33.869
I'm sorry, I've never...
I didn't know monks could be fired.

39:33.956 --> 39:35.071
Well, they can.

39:35.791 --> 39:38.533
I was told in no uncertain terms that

39:38.627 --> 39:41.209
the Abbey wasn't where
I was meant to end up.

39:41.296 --> 39:45.005
It's just a step along a path.

39:45.092 --> 39:47.834
God allegedly has bigger plans for me.

39:53.141 --> 39:56.133
[Penny] Something tells me
you don't entirely believe that.

39:56.228 --> 39:59.186
- I suspect that's because I don't.
- Maybe they're right.

39:59.273 --> 40:02.390
If you hadn't got fired,
we wouldn't have met, and then...

40:02.484 --> 40:05.897
How could you possibly help me
unload these crates in Carlisle.

40:07.489 --> 40:09.650
Did I say I was coming
to Carlisle with you?

40:10.492 --> 40:11.652
Not yet.

40:22.588 --> 40:25.330
Of course, if an ex-monk
already has plans, then...

40:25.424 --> 40:27.756
I don't usually get
into cars with strangers.

40:27.843 --> 40:30.255
Well, in that case, I'm Penelope.

40:32.556 --> 40:33.591
Penny.

40:35.392 --> 40:36.882
Desmond.

40:39.354 --> 40:40.935
Very nice to meet you, Penny.

40:51.533 --> 40:52.568
She's alive!

40:54.911 --> 40:58.153
Stand back! Get away from her!

41:00.375 --> 41:02.627
I'm here. I'm here, Penny.

41:02.711 --> 41:05.327
- Be careful...
- Just get off, Charlie.

41:05.422 --> 41:07.413
Sorry, Penny, sorry...

41:15.098 --> 41:16.383
Desmond...
