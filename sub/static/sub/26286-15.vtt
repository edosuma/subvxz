WEBVTT

00:00.031 --> 00:01.687
Previously on This Is Us

00:01.712 --> 00:03.023
I was just wondering

00:03.382 --> 00:04.843
if maybe we should...

00:05.421 --> 00:08.734
put a pin in your being a dance teacher.

00:08.736 --> 00:10.156
So you get to have your dream,

00:10.181 --> 00:12.915
and I'm just supposed to quit mine?

00:13.142 --> 00:15.531
Kevin, I know that you're in
there. Will you open the door?

00:16.895 --> 00:18.070
The Nicky thing?

00:18.095 --> 00:19.461
It messed me up a little bit.

00:19.522 --> 00:21.023
And I had a drink.

00:21.742 --> 00:23.718
I think my water just broke.

00:23.797 --> 00:26.080
I'm only 28 weeks. It's too soon.

00:26.105 --> 00:28.742
Toby, it's me. Listen, I'm
in the car with Kate and, uh,

00:28.767 --> 00:30.700
I really think we should
call an ambulance.

00:31.100 --> 00:33.476
- Because I've been drinking all day.
- Kate?

00:33.626 --> 00:35.312
That shot that they
gave you, it's working.

00:35.337 --> 00:37.367
It's delayed your labor
ten hours so far.

00:37.392 --> 00:39.757
I don't need hours, Kev, I need weeks.

00:41.000 --> 00:47.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:49.992 --> 00:51.296
Aw.

00:53.012 --> 00:54.351
Congratulations.

01:02.180 --> 01:03.406
And we can see

01:03.431 --> 01:05.851
that they live their lives
in the fast lane.

01:06.032 --> 01:08.945
In flight, they are just a blur.

01:10.351 --> 01:14.148
It's only when you slow down
their supercharged lives...

01:19.601 --> 01:21.250
Who's calling you at 4:00 a.m.?

01:21.833 --> 01:24.460
It's 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.

01:24.869 --> 01:27.382
One second stretched out to...

01:32.391 --> 01:34.458
Kev, can I see your charger?

01:34.992 --> 01:36.860
You can see it but you can't use it.

01:37.109 --> 01:39.296
Uh, you're at 70%.

01:39.523 --> 01:42.343
Okay, so, like,
I need 30 more percent, then.

01:42.368 --> 01:44.334
Why do you need your phone
so bad right now, Randall?

01:44.336 --> 01:45.469
It's for work.

01:45.742 --> 01:47.304
You're gonna work right now?

01:48.750 --> 01:50.156
- I have mine.
- Yeah?

01:50.342 --> 01:51.609
Thanks.

02:02.953 --> 02:05.689
It's an Advil, okay?
And I have a headache.

02:06.039 --> 02:08.023
- I didn't say anything.
- All right.

02:10.995 --> 02:12.898
I can't-I can't sit here anymore,

02:13.127 --> 02:14.406
just do nothing.

02:16.336 --> 02:18.249
This is ridiculous, right?

02:18.648 --> 02:21.546
Her water breaks and we're just,
uh, we're just waiting?

02:21.992 --> 02:24.500
I mean, it's been hours since
Toby came out with an update.

02:25.070 --> 02:27.511
- He's probably just focused on Kate.
- I'm sure.

02:27.585 --> 02:29.859
But I'll tell you what,
if Meghan Markle were here,

02:30.125 --> 02:31.448
right, her doctor would be out here

02:31.450 --> 02:33.014
giving us updates every two minutes.

02:33.039 --> 02:34.320
And Kate better not be back there

02:34.345 --> 02:36.328
getting anything less
than Meghan Markle treatment.

02:37.578 --> 02:38.820
Whatever that is.

02:39.897 --> 02:41.054
Baby Markle.

02:43.049 --> 02:44.632
Y'all know Baby Markle's gonna pop out

02:44.657 --> 02:46.090
in full hair and makeup, right?

02:46.245 --> 02:47.703
Little crown and scepter?

02:49.967 --> 02:51.320
Let me see if I can get an update.

02:51.345 --> 02:52.757
I just checked 20 minutes ago.

02:52.759 --> 02:54.867
Well, you're not the only one
that can get an update, Randall.

02:54.892 --> 02:56.742
Boys, please.

02:58.882 --> 03:00.421
Look, I know you're worried about her.

03:00.446 --> 03:02.343
We're all worried about her.

03:03.465 --> 03:05.280
And I know you got a lot going on.

03:05.875 --> 03:07.898
All right, but you just need to relax.

03:08.708 --> 03:09.914
- Relax.
- Yeah.

03:09.939 --> 03:11.625
- How am I supposed to do that?
- Sit down.

03:11.789 --> 03:14.531
- Shut your eyes for a minute.
- I'm not falling asleep right now.

03:14.556 --> 03:16.125
Well, then, learn something about birds.

03:16.150 --> 03:18.226
Birds? I know everything I want
to know about birds, Randall.

03:18.251 --> 03:21.812
Okay, look, I'm fine here,

03:21.837 --> 03:25.585
just, you know, you-you got to,
you got to let me breathe, man.

03:27.523 --> 03:29.382
- Okay.
- Hi.

03:40.265 --> 03:42.898
In the mountains, insects are...

03:43.527 --> 03:44.789
You okay, Mom?

03:45.232 --> 03:47.365
Want to get up and stretch?

03:48.500 --> 03:50.726
- Mom.
- Hmm? No.

03:50.751 --> 03:51.969
I'm fine.

03:54.754 --> 03:59.101
Have you ever noticed
that electrical outlets

03:59.126 --> 04:01.875
look like little surprised faces?

04:03.851 --> 04:06.944
Like little faces frozen mid-scream.

04:10.164 --> 04:11.402
- You see that?
- Yeah.

04:15.500 --> 04:18.367
- Are you Kate Pearson's family?
- Yes.

04:21.774 --> 04:26.882
synced and corrected by susinz
*www.addic7ed.com*

04:27.189 --> 04:29.921
The good news is that Kate
made it to 28 weeks.

04:29.977 --> 04:32.778
That's a huge milestone
in fetal development.

04:33.039 --> 04:34.505
So far, the tocolytics are working.

04:34.507 --> 04:36.070
Labor has been delayed, and that's good.

04:36.095 --> 04:38.343
We want to keep the baby in
as long as possible

04:38.368 --> 04:40.734
to develop his brain, lungs.

04:41.080 --> 04:44.031
But the longer we wait, the more
we run the risk of infection.

04:44.179 --> 04:45.695
So we've got Kate on antibiotics...

04:45.720 --> 04:48.054
So, uh, what are... you're saying
Kate has an infection?

04:48.415 --> 04:50.625
No, but there is a risk.

04:53.507 --> 04:55.500
Have you all been here
since Kate was admitted?

04:56.117 --> 04:59.363
Uh, we all arrived at different
times, but yes, sir.

04:59.365 --> 05:01.687
26 hours. Do we smell like it?

05:02.101 --> 05:04.484
There's really no
need for all of you to stay.

05:04.695 --> 05:06.334
Uh, we'll call you if we have any news.

05:06.359 --> 05:08.898
Feel free to freshen up,
get some normal food.

05:08.923 --> 05:10.187
We're staying.

05:11.500 --> 05:13.765
- I know you feel like you...
- This family stays.

05:15.398 --> 05:16.514
Dr. Monroe,

05:16.516 --> 05:20.284
um, what kind of tocolytic
did you actually administer?

05:20.286 --> 05:22.585
Because if it was, uh,

05:22.610 --> 05:25.890
ter-terbutaline,
there's a whole list of...

05:26.177 --> 05:28.937
Uh, do me a favor,
for all of our sanities,

05:28.962 --> 05:30.815
let's stay off of the Internet.

05:30.840 --> 05:32.304
I like to pretend
we still live in a world

05:32.329 --> 05:34.132
where only doctors are doctors.

05:35.180 --> 05:36.789
Do you have any more questions for me?

05:37.542 --> 05:38.773
Just, uh...

05:39.899 --> 05:41.796
All right, here's the thing. Listen, um,

05:41.821 --> 05:45.560
all due respect, uh,
I have the financial means

05:45.585 --> 05:48.279
to get Kate any doctor
in Los Angeles, okay?

05:48.281 --> 05:50.148
So if there's a point
in time that you reach

05:50.173 --> 05:52.296
where you're like, "Well, I
might not be able to administer

05:52.321 --> 05:53.985
the best possible care" for my sister...

05:54.010 --> 05:55.367
- Mm.
- I can make a call.

05:55.507 --> 05:57.827
And hey, listen,
I realize how awful that sounds,

05:57.852 --> 06:00.086
but I'm way past the point
of self-consciousness, so...

06:00.851 --> 06:02.578
- I'll make that call.
- You'll have to excuse

06:02.603 --> 06:05.281
my brother, Doc, he's not
his best self right now.

06:05.306 --> 06:07.070
Yeah, excuse me for helping to
try and make sure that Kate...

06:07.095 --> 06:09.609
Now, we trust that you are
doing your best. Thank you.

06:12.574 --> 06:14.617
I'll update you as soon
as I have more information.

06:14.642 --> 06:15.929
Sure. Okay, yeah.

06:17.649 --> 06:19.316
You can all relax, trust me.

06:19.451 --> 06:20.992
The fact that you're seeing me out here

06:21.017 --> 06:23.257
means that nothing crazy
is happening in there.

06:23.615 --> 06:24.812
Okay?

06:25.627 --> 06:26.820
Yeah.

06:37.457 --> 06:40.025
Has a bizarre
way of impressing the female.

06:40.497 --> 06:42.398
- Its courtship lasts...
- Kev.

06:43.587 --> 06:46.312
And was unnoticed
until the high-speed camera

06:46.337 --> 06:47.570
revealed its...

06:48.324 --> 06:52.351
Hey, I used to, uh, I used
to play this game with my kids.

06:53.022 --> 06:56.203
Name a food, any food,
that isn't made better

06:56.228 --> 06:57.890
with either chocolate or ranch.

06:58.548 --> 06:59.906
- What if you don't like ranch?
- Well,

06:59.931 --> 07:01.578
in order to play this game,
you have to like ranch.

07:01.678 --> 07:02.820
I'm out.

07:03.654 --> 07:04.906
Hmm.

07:06.341 --> 07:08.343
- Cantaloupe.
- That's chocolate.

07:08.580 --> 07:10.828
- It's always better with chocolate.
- Hmm.

07:13.199 --> 07:15.593
Uh... how about oysters?

07:15.904 --> 07:17.531
- Ranch.
- Really?

07:17.556 --> 07:18.956
- I don't know if I'd put ranch on...
- Ranch.

07:24.527 --> 07:26.617
I'm fine. I'm just a little hungover.

07:28.491 --> 07:30.158
You know, a hangover, it's when you, uh,

07:30.183 --> 07:31.968
when you drink too much alcohol
and you don't have enough,

07:31.993 --> 07:33.367
- enough water.
- Yeah.

07:34.893 --> 07:36.835
Guys, I know Toby told you I was drunk,

07:36.906 --> 07:38.929
that's why we took an
ambulance to the hospital.

07:40.397 --> 07:41.890
I had an intense week, okay?

07:41.915 --> 07:44.048
I had a few drinks, I didn't go
back to the pain pills,

07:44.073 --> 07:45.445
if that's what you're wondering.

07:45.876 --> 07:48.492
Wasn't a shining moment,
but it was not out of control.

07:50.208 --> 07:51.804
No one here is judging you.

07:52.525 --> 07:55.414
Just, haven't been
my best self recently.

07:55.439 --> 07:57.718
Everyone, just, let's wait.

07:58.080 --> 07:59.328
It will be fine.

08:05.168 --> 08:07.085
She's barely moved in hours.

08:08.025 --> 08:09.226
I know.

08:13.833 --> 08:14.914
You can get that.

08:14.939 --> 08:17.062
Oh, can I? Thank you.

08:20.428 --> 08:21.468
She's just tired.

08:21.493 --> 08:22.500
Mm.

08:23.687 --> 08:24.808
Wonder why.

08:24.880 --> 08:26.031
Yeah, well, we're all tired.

08:26.056 --> 08:27.414
Oh, we are, aren't we?

08:30.603 --> 08:32.046
- Sushi.
- Ranch.

08:33.025 --> 08:35.109
- Really?
- Yeah. 100%.

08:35.134 --> 08:36.359
Think about it.

08:47.321 --> 08:48.351
It's gel.

08:49.812 --> 08:51.796
It's supposed to last longer, but, uh,

08:52.382 --> 08:54.171
always end up peeling it off.

08:57.214 --> 09:00.039
I got it just after you got back
from seeing your uncle.

09:01.056 --> 09:03.851
When we were supposed
to go for lunch, uh,

09:04.334 --> 09:07.070
you said that you had
this audition thing come up.

09:09.684 --> 09:11.054
Were you drinking then?

09:16.909 --> 09:18.968
- Were you drinking in Vietnam?
- No.

09:19.959 --> 09:21.460
I wasn't drinking then.

09:21.772 --> 09:22.812
I wasn't.

09:25.471 --> 09:26.890
Are we gonna talk about this?

09:27.570 --> 09:28.859
Hey, guys.

09:29.539 --> 09:30.750
I got doughnuts.

09:31.171 --> 09:32.806
It's all I could find that was open.

09:32.808 --> 09:35.335
There was Chinese,
but that seemed too saucy.

09:36.112 --> 09:37.726
Any word from Toby?

09:38.007 --> 09:40.000
- No.
- Oh.

09:40.398 --> 09:42.890
Well, no news is good news, right?

09:44.031 --> 09:47.117
Okay, so there is regular,

09:47.142 --> 09:50.164
blueberry, glazed and gluten free.

09:51.560 --> 09:53.375
Very nice of you. Thanks.

09:57.117 --> 09:58.312
Oh, Kevin,

09:58.742 --> 10:00.167
how was Vietnam?

10:00.169 --> 10:01.368
Was it so humid?

10:01.370 --> 10:03.562
It looked humid on Instagram.

10:06.346 --> 10:08.375
I mean, uh, yeah.

10:11.192 --> 10:13.546
Well, I am dying to go.

10:18.601 --> 10:21.140
Hey, Madison, we're, uh,
we're playing a game.

10:21.329 --> 10:23.398
Name any food, any food at all,

10:23.423 --> 10:27.953
that is not made better
by either chocolate or ranch.

10:28.943 --> 10:30.015
Oh.

10:32.346 --> 10:33.585
Toothpaste.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.072
That's not a food. It doesn't count.

10:39.781 --> 10:40.992
What about gum, then?

10:41.088 --> 10:42.955
- Also not a food.
- Huh.

10:43.804 --> 10:45.179
Everything okay?

10:45.181 --> 10:46.648
Yeah, it was the studio.

10:46.673 --> 10:48.882
They just wanted to know
if I could cover a class today.

10:49.742 --> 10:51.171
I'm sorry you're missing that.

10:52.488 --> 10:54.414
- Thanks for being here.
- Mm.

10:55.724 --> 10:56.960
Hey, are we gonna air this out?

10:57.460 --> 10:59.328
Or are you just gonna
keep on being weird to me

10:59.353 --> 11:01.679
till Kate and Toby's kid is in college?

11:02.068 --> 11:03.328
College.

11:03.593 --> 11:06.429
Hey, I didn't mean that you
shouldn't teach dance at all.

11:06.812 --> 11:08.835
I just asked if it was the right time.

11:08.860 --> 11:10.593
- We got a lot of stuff going on.
- That is why

11:10.618 --> 11:12.683
I asked you to drop out of
the race in the first place...

11:12.708 --> 11:15.225
But I didn't, and I won. So here we are.

11:15.250 --> 11:17.835
All right, I don't want to do this
right now, okay? We're here for Kate.

11:18.273 --> 11:19.468
I'll take a gluten one.

11:19.493 --> 11:21.601
- Hey, Beth...
- Okay, you know what, Randall?

11:21.626 --> 11:22.639
You want to talk about it, then let's

11:22.664 --> 11:24.289
just talk about it with everybody.
Right?

11:24.314 --> 11:26.281
So, Randall thinks that I shouldn't

11:26.306 --> 11:28.578
- be teaching dance right now.
- I never said that.

11:29.191 --> 11:31.539
- What are you teaching? Oh.
- Ballet.

11:31.564 --> 11:33.437
Yeah, on nights and weekends.

11:33.853 --> 11:35.726
It's just, you know, I feel like...

11:36.656 --> 11:38.398
if your wife wants to try something new,

11:38.400 --> 11:39.833
- you should support that.
- Hey, thanks, Kev.

11:39.835 --> 11:42.234
I appreciate your advice
in this private matter.

11:42.569 --> 11:45.137
Hey, I just want to
teach dance classes, okay?

11:45.522 --> 11:48.234
I love Misty Copeland.
Do you follow her?

11:48.929 --> 11:51.345
God, it must seem like
I'm only on Instagram.

11:51.750 --> 11:53.976
- I am. I love it.
- I'm sorry,

11:54.001 --> 11:55.433
what exactly are you doing here?

11:58.921 --> 12:00.387
Oh, I, um...

12:01.109 --> 12:03.335
No, it's, uh, it's weird that I'm here.

12:03.360 --> 12:05.426
This is a... family thing.

12:05.451 --> 12:07.785
Um, I'll go. Uh...

12:08.234 --> 12:10.297
can someone text me if you, um...

12:10.299 --> 12:11.812
if you hear of anything?

12:13.367 --> 12:14.609
I'll just, um...

12:14.742 --> 12:17.398
- I'll just leave the doughnuts.
- I-I'm sorry.

12:27.497 --> 12:30.187
I'm sorry, I'm being an ass, um...

12:31.645 --> 12:33.468
I'm-I'm sorry. I'm gonna take a walk.

12:34.531 --> 12:36.710
- Where? Where you going?
- Uh, the elevator, I don't know.

12:36.735 --> 12:38.812
- Want some company?
- No. I'm...

12:39.711 --> 12:41.554
I'm just gonna get some air.
I'll be okay.

12:51.714 --> 12:53.280
Did you know he was drinking again?

12:53.861 --> 12:55.007
No.

12:59.783 --> 13:01.687
Other birds found a different way

13:02.705 --> 13:03.882
in the high mountains...

13:06.609 --> 13:09.164
The circles on the chairs
look like bacteria.

13:10.945 --> 13:13.609
Right? Isn't that what
bacteria looks like?

13:13.970 --> 13:16.890
What a strange choice for a hospital.

13:33.543 --> 13:35.406
So we're just not gonna
talk about his relapse?

13:37.169 --> 13:39.304
I feel like we should be trying
to get ahead of it this time.

13:39.329 --> 13:40.929
One thing at a time, Randall.

13:49.372 --> 13:51.031
Did Miguel just "dad voice" me?

13:52.601 --> 13:55.296
Yeah, you know
what they say about the second.

13:56.099 --> 13:58.257
Yep, it just slid right out.

13:58.282 --> 14:01.718
Yeah, she pushed for,
like, ten minutes. Yeah.

14:03.293 --> 14:05.093
No, they're stitching her back up now.

14:06.828 --> 14:09.335
I know. I'm a double grandma.

14:10.667 --> 14:14.093
I know. Oh... yeah, okay.

14:14.513 --> 14:15.820
Bye-bye.

14:16.350 --> 14:17.625
Mm.

14:18.084 --> 14:21.437
- Congratulations.
- Oh, thanks.

14:21.735 --> 14:24.742
I was hoping for a boy,
but all girls in my family.

14:42.916 --> 14:45.687
This aggravating moment
brought to you by Rold Gold.

14:46.751 --> 14:48.017
Wait, I got a better one.

14:48.489 --> 14:53.203
Rold Gold Pretzels, diffusing
tense family moments since 1923.

14:56.015 --> 14:57.382
This woman's about to get drop-kicked.

14:57.407 --> 14:58.687
You're not gonna drop-kick a grandma.

14:58.712 --> 15:01.648
Watch me. Drop-kick...

15:06.933 --> 15:11.136
Baby... it's not that I don't
want you to do what you love.

15:11.161 --> 15:13.750
I just have some practical questions.

15:14.808 --> 15:17.140
City council isn't volunteer work,

15:17.165 --> 15:19.351
but it's a fraction
of what I used to make.

15:19.921 --> 15:21.609
- And without your salary...
- I know.

15:21.634 --> 15:23.765
So I'm just saying,
if we're gonna get childcare,

15:23.954 --> 15:27.117
is the cost of that childcare
greater than or equal to

15:27.142 --> 15:28.664
what we'd be bringing in?

15:29.875 --> 15:31.250
You mean what I'd be bringing in.

15:31.275 --> 15:32.820
I didn't say... oh...

15:37.287 --> 15:38.414
What about pumpkin?

15:38.439 --> 15:40.546
- Chocolate.
- Really?

15:40.571 --> 15:42.170
Or ranch, actually,

15:42.195 --> 15:45.148
depending on whether it's
a savory or sweet pumpkin dish.

15:45.745 --> 15:46.750
Huh.

15:47.003 --> 15:49.812
Jack's least favorite pie was pumpkin.

15:51.539 --> 15:54.492
Hey, Rebecca, you want me to
get you something to eat?

15:55.335 --> 15:56.382
- Mm.
- Oh, she's...

15:56.426 --> 15:57.984
she's got water, and she had a bar...

15:58.009 --> 16:00.859
Miguel, please, you don't have
to answer for her.

16:01.828 --> 16:04.265
I did. I had a bar. I'm okay.

16:09.371 --> 16:10.523
Bathroom.

16:22.001 --> 16:23.679
If you want to teach, I'm on board.

16:25.758 --> 16:27.289
I just want you to be happy.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.572
If you're not happy, I'm not happy.

16:29.574 --> 16:31.328
Which is a very selfish thing to say.

16:31.353 --> 16:35.187
Uh, why are you twisting around
everything that I say?

16:35.212 --> 16:38.164
Because I want you to see it
the way I'm hearing it.

16:38.603 --> 16:39.953
Want me to...?

16:41.085 --> 16:42.921
- Ooh.
- Oh, hey.

16:43.148 --> 16:45.570
- Hey...
- I-I'm okay. I'm just... I'm...

16:47.525 --> 16:48.843
a little lightheaded.

16:48.868 --> 16:50.281
When did you have that bar?

16:51.027 --> 16:54.054
I don't remember, but I'm not hungry.

16:54.079 --> 16:56.421
- You look hungry.
- I'm fine, Beth.

16:56.446 --> 16:58.156
- How about a doughnut?
- No, I...

16:58.181 --> 16:59.718
I really don't want a doughnut.

16:59.743 --> 17:01.203
You know what, Rebecca?

17:01.881 --> 17:03.992
There was one year
where Annie refused to eat

17:04.017 --> 17:05.444
anything that wasn't orange.

17:05.608 --> 17:07.054
So I got mad skills.

17:07.173 --> 17:09.492
Don't make me airplane
a doughnut into your mouth.

17:09.791 --> 17:10.906
I'm not a kid.

17:10.931 --> 17:12.117
Okay, here we go.

17:12.142 --> 17:13.890
- Here comes the doughnut.
- Okay.

17:21.478 --> 17:22.585
Mmm.

17:26.916 --> 17:28.140
Thank you.

17:49.441 --> 17:51.242
- Hey.
- Hi.

17:55.544 --> 17:57.390
- Still here.
- I see.

17:57.464 --> 17:59.046
- Uh, yeah.
- Are you all right?

17:59.553 --> 18:00.750
Yeah.

18:01.537 --> 18:02.570
Okay.

18:06.041 --> 18:08.000
She had a really clear birth plan.

18:10.184 --> 18:12.289
They tell you not to make a plan
but, I mean...

18:12.686 --> 18:13.843
come on.

18:14.407 --> 18:16.039
Well, people make plans.

18:16.182 --> 18:17.343
Exactly.

18:17.487 --> 18:19.148
And Kate makes plans.

18:19.468 --> 18:21.125
She had a playlist to push to,

18:21.251 --> 18:23.078
I was supposed to take the first
public pictures

18:23.103 --> 18:24.531
because I have portrait mode...

18:25.650 --> 18:26.882
And she needs Ruth.

18:27.790 --> 18:28.914
Ruth?

18:29.666 --> 18:30.953
Bader Ginsburg.

18:31.841 --> 18:33.775
We were out after group a few months ago

18:33.800 --> 18:35.666
and we passed this baby store.

18:36.059 --> 18:37.500
She didn't want to go in.

18:37.959 --> 18:40.926
And I was like, "Kate,
you need to show the universe

18:40.951 --> 18:42.885
you believe this is going to happen."

18:43.648 --> 18:45.921
So she got this Ruth Bader Ginsburg doll

18:45.946 --> 18:47.406
to give him as soon as he was born.

18:48.026 --> 18:50.757
Because she wanted him
to be immediately surrounded

18:50.782 --> 18:52.484
by strong female influences.

18:52.723 --> 18:53.789
Yeah.

18:54.745 --> 18:56.578
The baby's coming too early.

18:56.841 --> 18:58.441
The doll's locked in her apartment.

18:58.646 --> 18:59.820
Her plan is falling apart,

18:59.845 --> 19:01.648
but I was supposed to
be here the whole time.

19:02.942 --> 19:04.359
At least I can give her that.

19:07.164 --> 19:08.304
But I should go.

19:08.404 --> 19:09.703
Kevin's right, I...

19:10.401 --> 19:11.929
it's weird that I'm here.

19:11.954 --> 19:13.140
I'm not family.

19:14.031 --> 19:15.164
Look, it's...

19:16.545 --> 19:17.726
it's tough.

19:18.275 --> 19:20.140
Feeling on the outside of this family.

19:20.836 --> 19:22.789
When Rebecca and I first, um...

19:24.449 --> 19:25.625
I've tried...

19:26.549 --> 19:29.296
to find my place
in the family, you know?

19:29.953 --> 19:31.078
Without...

19:31.441 --> 19:33.241
sitting in s-somebody else's seat.

19:33.415 --> 19:34.718
And the thing is...

19:35.208 --> 19:36.914
I don't mind standing.

19:37.353 --> 19:38.781
When you stand, you...

19:39.096 --> 19:40.414
you can just listen.

19:41.244 --> 19:42.382
Observe.

19:42.968 --> 19:45.671
You can, you can lighten up
the conversation...

19:45.989 --> 19:47.679
if it's getting too intense.

19:48.207 --> 19:49.617
Oh, and you're closest to the kitchen

19:49.642 --> 19:51.308
when somebody else needs some iced tea.

19:54.289 --> 19:56.320
Look, Madison...

19:56.514 --> 19:59.046
if you really want
to help Kate through this...

20:00.981 --> 20:02.398
I'm sure you can find a way.

20:06.110 --> 20:07.468
- Thank you.
- Mhm.

20:09.961 --> 20:11.195
Nope.

20:16.752 --> 20:17.984
Any news?

20:19.359 --> 20:20.970
No. Uh-uh.

20:21.456 --> 20:22.570
Oh.

20:32.309 --> 20:33.492
You hungry?

20:35.131 --> 20:36.343
No, not really.

20:39.267 --> 20:40.882
There's a great new restaurant nearby.

20:41.241 --> 20:42.382
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

20:42.407 --> 20:43.765
Has a Michelin star.

20:44.671 --> 20:45.796
I can get us a table.

20:45.915 --> 20:46.948
- Really?
- Mm.

20:47.270 --> 20:48.921
It's called "Vending Machine."

20:51.448 --> 20:52.859
Just stand in front of it.

20:59.517 --> 21:00.890
So when did it start?

21:06.655 --> 21:07.820
At my uncle's.

21:10.164 --> 21:11.593
Well, you could've
talked to me about it.

21:11.618 --> 21:14.812
I've... I mean,
I've shared so much with you.

21:14.837 --> 21:16.484
I-I didn't want to drag you into it.

21:17.885 --> 21:19.742
It's too late. I'm in it.

21:25.427 --> 21:28.976
I had a rough couple of weeks, you know,

21:29.001 --> 21:30.836
and we'll-we'll talk about it, um...

21:31.107 --> 21:32.343
I know I owe you that.

21:35.735 --> 21:37.875
I just, I need to know
you're not lying to me.

21:38.970 --> 21:41.367
I know. It's over.

21:41.392 --> 21:42.617
Okay, I promise.

21:46.446 --> 21:47.507
Feel like I just... I...

21:47.532 --> 21:49.218
I feel like I just got
some eye contact there.

21:49.243 --> 21:51.277
- I'm gonna see if I can get some Intel.
- Okay.

21:51.302 --> 21:52.890
- I'm going to Vending Machine.
- Yeah?

21:53.060 --> 21:54.961
Pick me up some steak frites, will you?

21:54.986 --> 21:56.023
Sure.

22:00.676 --> 22:01.976
You want to get out of here?

22:03.146 --> 22:04.312
Go where?

22:04.337 --> 22:07.546
I don't know. I was thinking,
like, Kauai or Bali

22:07.703 --> 22:09.531
or anywhere with a bunch of vowels

22:09.556 --> 22:10.718
where these crazy-ass brothers

22:10.743 --> 22:13.398
- can't find us.
- Man, what about the girls?

22:13.423 --> 22:15.062
Oh, I'll send for them.

22:17.338 --> 22:19.742
You know, you and Randall,

22:19.767 --> 22:21.304
you always figure it out.

22:23.235 --> 22:24.320
Yeah.

22:25.903 --> 22:27.054
How you doing?

22:27.644 --> 22:30.117
I... I mean, now it all makes sense.

22:30.194 --> 22:33.734
Right? I thought he just needed space

22:33.759 --> 22:36.526
after everything with his uncle,
and I get that.

22:36.611 --> 22:38.351
I invented needing space.

22:40.521 --> 22:42.211
What gets me is that he lied.

22:44.461 --> 22:46.070
I know you're in there like,

22:46.224 --> 22:48.468
"I got to bounce. I got to go."

22:50.977 --> 22:52.742
I wouldn't judge you if you did.

22:55.678 --> 22:56.757
Would you...

22:57.905 --> 22:59.679
would you judge me if I stayed?

23:04.587 --> 23:05.711
Never.

23:19.359 --> 23:20.976
I feel like I need something.

23:22.359 --> 23:24.514
Coffee or breakfasts

23:24.539 --> 23:26.781
or a cocktail at this point.

23:28.327 --> 23:30.046
- Sorry.
- I get it.

23:34.750 --> 23:35.833
Squash.

23:35.858 --> 23:37.057
Ranch.

23:37.171 --> 23:39.999
Yeah, p-pumpkin is technically
a squash. We did pumpkin.

23:40.024 --> 23:41.823
- We already did pumpkin.
- You know what?

23:41.825 --> 23:43.468
- Screw this game.
- Mm-hmm.

23:47.890 --> 23:50.781
So does anyone know if they've
picked out a name yet?

23:51.578 --> 23:53.802
Uh, well, it's a boy, right?
So I just...

23:53.804 --> 23:55.671
Yeah, we kind of assumed
that it would...

23:55.673 --> 23:57.343
No, they want to meet him first...

23:57.675 --> 23:59.320
- Oh.
- And then decide on his name

23:59.345 --> 24:02.344
because it's hard to name
a person you haven't met before.

24:02.634 --> 24:03.703
That's right.

24:03.968 --> 24:06.523
Kate used to name her stuffed
animals the craziest things.

24:07.640 --> 24:10.976
There was "Tuesday." Uh... "Marvelous."

24:11.001 --> 24:13.538
There was, um... "Evelyn."

24:13.563 --> 24:14.829
- Which one was Evelyn?
- That monkey, remember?

24:14.831 --> 24:16.898
That's right, the monkey.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:17.593 --> 24:18.804
And, um...

24:19.470 --> 24:22.226
she would say good night to each
of them before she went to bed.

24:24.411 --> 24:27.921
She wanted each one to hear
its name before she fell asleep.

24:29.120 --> 24:30.226
It took forever.

24:33.187 --> 24:34.570
She was destined to be a mom.

24:36.749 --> 24:37.812
Right, Mom?

24:39.046 --> 24:40.078
Mom?

24:40.453 --> 24:42.914
There's 17 chairs in here.

24:42.977 --> 24:44.648
You would think there would be

24:45.380 --> 24:46.828
an even number.

24:49.566 --> 24:50.789
Mom, you sure you don't want to...

24:50.814 --> 24:51.914
Randall.

25:00.336 --> 25:01.351
Hey.

25:01.557 --> 25:02.898
We gonna figure this out.

25:04.609 --> 25:07.171
Maybe Mom and Miguel can help us out.

25:08.195 --> 25:09.695
- Hmm?
- What can Miguel do?

25:09.889 --> 25:11.822
Beth and I are just
starting to figure out

25:11.847 --> 25:13.881
what our schedule looks like
once I get sworn in.

25:13.906 --> 25:15.472
Apparently, being a city councilman

25:15.497 --> 25:16.789
requires a lot of hours,

25:16.814 --> 25:18.914
which comes as a real shock to Randall.

25:18.939 --> 25:20.976
Sorry, sorry. I forgot we changed tones.

25:21.273 --> 25:23.046
So I was thinking maybe you guys

25:23.071 --> 25:24.637
could help us out with the girls.

25:24.836 --> 25:26.039
You know, you're always asking

25:26.064 --> 25:27.750
to spend more time with them, so...

25:28.601 --> 25:29.804
Merry Christmas!

25:30.033 --> 25:32.300
Or happy Easter.
What day is today? I don't know.

25:32.482 --> 25:33.685
Well, um...

25:34.968 --> 25:36.921
We've actually... It's okay.

25:36.946 --> 25:38.609
We've been thinking about, uh,

25:38.967 --> 25:41.914
about relocating, out to California.

25:45.292 --> 25:46.328
What?

25:47.150 --> 25:48.257
Just...

25:48.844 --> 25:51.640
You know, to be there for Kate,
to help out with the baby.

25:54.360 --> 25:55.453
Okay.

25:57.761 --> 25:59.586
Were you gonna tell us?

25:59.813 --> 26:01.625
- Randall... I'm sorry, listen.
- Of course.

26:01.650 --> 26:03.718
I know you called dibs on Mom
for the past 38 years,

26:03.743 --> 26:05.381
but I'm pretty sure
it's not a binding contract.

26:05.406 --> 26:07.765
- Will you shut the hell up, please?
- This is just something

26:07.790 --> 26:09.500
- that we are considering.
- Exactly.

26:09.525 --> 26:11.803
There are retirement communities,

26:11.828 --> 26:14.125
very nice retirement communities,
just outside of the city,

26:14.150 --> 26:16.398
and your mom loves succulents.

26:16.423 --> 26:19.203
- Since when?
- It's just an idea

26:19.228 --> 26:20.718
that we're considering,
Randall, that's all.

26:20.743 --> 26:21.820
Okay. I can't do this.

26:22.046 --> 26:23.093
What are you doing?

26:23.118 --> 26:24.945
Oh, I'm gonna turn off these damn birds.

26:24.970 --> 26:27.704
Kev, leave the TV alone, man.
Hey, hey. It's not our...

26:27.729 --> 26:29.468
- Kevin! Leave the...
- There.

26:29.633 --> 26:30.857
There you go, no more birds.

26:30.882 --> 26:32.265
I can't watch those things anymore.

26:32.290 --> 26:33.609
I don't care how they store their food.

26:33.634 --> 26:35.695
Look, man, I know we're
all a little stressed out, okay?

26:35.720 --> 26:37.539
Stressed out?
Well, that's a casual word.

26:37.564 --> 26:38.742
Do I look stressed to you, huh?

26:38.767 --> 26:40.804
I'm not stressed, Randall,
I'm losing my mind.

26:41.879 --> 26:43.914
None of us know
what's going on back there.

26:44.770 --> 26:47.132
All right?
There-there-there's a whole host

26:47.157 --> 26:48.842
of-of potential horrible problems

26:48.867 --> 26:50.921
that could be going on right
now. And, yes, I googled it.

26:50.946 --> 26:53.265
Okay? And-and I know
the half-assed doctor

26:53.290 --> 26:54.992
told me not to Google it,
but I googled it.

26:55.212 --> 26:57.367
There's a plethora of problems
that could happen

26:57.392 --> 26:59.031
if a baby's born that early, all right?

26:59.056 --> 27:00.742
A brain hemorrhage, for one.

27:01.015 --> 27:02.726
Could have trouble breathing
for the rest of its life.

27:02.751 --> 27:05.398
- I could go on and on and on.
- Please stop it. Stop it. Okay?

27:13.911 --> 27:15.243
I'm just saying, we don't know anything.

27:15.268 --> 27:17.968
And we haven't seen that doctor,
right, in-in God knows how long.

27:18.453 --> 27:20.014
- That can't be good.
- Look, if you're gonna spiral,

27:20.016 --> 27:21.007
why don't you go do it
somewhere else, huh?

27:21.032 --> 27:23.718
You know what? Excuse me. Hi. Hi.

27:23.937 --> 27:25.578
How are you? Listen, uh,

27:26.177 --> 27:28.664
I really need an update on my sister.

27:28.804 --> 27:29.914
- Sir, I...
- I need you to

27:29.939 --> 27:32.725
go back there, please,
and get an update on my sister.

27:32.750 --> 27:35.597
Now, we have been sitting out
here, relatively patiently...

27:35.599 --> 27:36.731
- Sir, I can't...
- No, no,

27:36.733 --> 27:38.900
I think it's fair,
just walk back there, please,

27:38.902 --> 27:41.906
- and get an update on my sister.
- One minute.

27:43.540 --> 27:46.711
Yes, I have the Pearson family
wanting an update from Dr. Monroe.

27:49.698 --> 27:51.468
He's in emergency surgery.

27:52.696 --> 27:54.257
Sir, I can't give you an update yet.

27:56.296 --> 27:57.429
Randall.

27:58.089 --> 27:59.421
Mom, um...

28:00.744 --> 28:03.046
Dr. Monroe just went into
emergency surgery.

28:04.703 --> 28:06.906
What? What kind of surgery?

28:06.931 --> 28:08.328
- Is it Kate?
- I don't know.

28:08.353 --> 28:10.720
- She wouldn't tell me.
- Let me try.

28:10.964 --> 28:12.464
I just did, Randall.

28:13.171 --> 28:14.702
How you doing? My sister,

28:14.704 --> 28:16.784
Kate Pearson,
is she in surgery right now?

28:23.263 --> 28:25.726
Hi, again. I know I'm
all up in your business.

28:25.751 --> 28:27.320
I was just wondering if Dr. Monroe

28:27.345 --> 28:28.914
is in with my sister, Kate Pearson.

28:29.045 --> 28:31.789
The doctor will come and talk
to you once he's out of surgery.

28:32.081 --> 28:33.703
Cool. Cool, cool, cool.

28:33.798 --> 28:36.171
I'm sorry, what does that mean?

28:36.487 --> 28:38.101
Does the doctor have something to say?

28:39.171 --> 28:41.586
The doctor will come
and update you with any news.

28:42.398 --> 28:43.414
- Randall.
- Sorry.

28:43.439 --> 28:44.929
I'm just getting some clarity. Sorry.

28:44.954 --> 28:47.742
If the doctor has an update,
he will share it with you.

28:47.876 --> 28:49.961
You realize you just said
the same thing three times,

28:49.986 --> 28:51.179
but with different words.

28:51.774 --> 28:53.976
Just as you've been asking me
the same question.

28:54.745 --> 28:55.836
Copy that.

29:00.830 --> 29:02.929
- Any new info?
- Nope.

29:03.762 --> 29:06.546
- That's interesting.
- How so, Kev?

29:07.367 --> 29:08.429
Well, I just think it's obvious

29:08.454 --> 29:09.820
that she wouldn't
tell me anything, right?

29:09.845 --> 29:12.080
I mean, I'm just a fallen drunk,
but you, I mean,

29:12.105 --> 29:13.371
I figured they'd trust you.

29:13.373 --> 29:14.562
- You know, I'm not gonna do this...
- I mean, one look at you

29:14.587 --> 29:15.984
and it's like, that's the guy
we want in charge.

29:16.009 --> 29:17.492
- I'm not gonna do this...
- Watermelon.

29:18.724 --> 29:20.468
Nope. Chocolate.

29:20.744 --> 29:22.484
Basically all fruit is chocolate.

29:22.509 --> 29:23.937
Miguel, I swear before God...

29:24.067 --> 29:27.015
You know what, maybe if you
hadn't left me with Nicky...

29:27.397 --> 29:29.156
- Hmm?
- He had to get home, Kevin.

29:29.181 --> 29:30.726
- Okay?
- That's our dad's brother.

29:32.921 --> 29:34.711
You didn't even care, though, right?

29:34.736 --> 29:35.851
You just, you just left me with him.

29:35.876 --> 29:37.617
Because you were the best
equipped to deal with him.

29:37.642 --> 29:38.708
Why am I the most...

29:38.733 --> 29:40.531
Because we're both,
uh, we're both messes?

29:40.556 --> 29:42.593
- We're both weak, disorganized messes?
- Hey, guys...

29:42.618 --> 29:43.796
Hey, not now, Miguel.

29:43.821 --> 29:45.211
I don't appreciate being
talked to that way.

29:45.236 --> 29:46.640
Honestly, man, this doesn't concern you.

29:46.665 --> 29:48.726
And it never does, does it?
I never get a seat at the table.

29:48.751 --> 29:50.351
- What table?
- Why don't you just, uh, relax

29:50.376 --> 29:52.765
and understand that Randall
gets the final say

29:52.790 --> 29:55.424
in our family, okay?
He's the moral center over here.

29:55.654 --> 29:58.875
- Right, he's the, uh, de facto hero dad.
- I'm just saying...

29:58.900 --> 30:00.100
In fact, I'm-I'm surprised
he's not back there

30:00.125 --> 30:01.500
delivering Kate's baby with
his bare hands right now.

30:01.525 --> 30:02.877
Oh, man. There you go again, Kev.

30:02.902 --> 30:04.187
- Turn it around on me.
- I'm just saying, I shouldn't have

30:04.212 --> 30:05.824
- to stand. I shouldn't have to stand.
- God forbid you take

30:05.849 --> 30:07.211
any responsibility for your damn life.

30:07.236 --> 30:09.296
What're you talking about? You think
I feel good about myself right now?

30:09.321 --> 30:11.468
I don't know, Kev.
You always somehow manage

30:11.493 --> 30:12.945
- to come out on top. Yeah.
- Really?

30:12.970 --> 30:15.632
- How... What am I on top of?
- Anything you want to do...

30:15.657 --> 30:16.687
- Randall.
- Stop it!

30:17.202 --> 30:19.429
Everyone, stop it.

30:23.499 --> 30:25.078
None of this matters.

30:29.364 --> 30:32.281
Do you know that I remember
every single detail

30:32.964 --> 30:35.625
of the waiting room the night
that I took your father in

30:35.650 --> 30:36.929
to see about his burn?

30:39.141 --> 30:41.046
Six other people waiting,

30:41.829 --> 30:43.171
two of them asleep.

30:45.486 --> 30:47.429
Only one electrical outlet.

30:49.982 --> 30:53.211
A big fake potted plant.

30:56.071 --> 30:59.218
Chairs pushed so close together
that when he leaned on me,

30:59.243 --> 31:02.453
my fingers got pinched between the arms.

31:05.660 --> 31:07.577
The arms of the chair were covered

31:07.602 --> 31:09.484
in something sticky, like...

31:12.255 --> 31:16.590
kid's candy fingers
or someone else's sweat.

31:19.065 --> 31:20.601
Bright green cushions...

31:22.622 --> 31:24.554
covered in plastic

31:24.579 --> 31:26.452
so they could be wiped easily.

31:30.277 --> 31:32.336
Your father said that they looked like

31:33.258 --> 31:35.257
"key lime pie you could sit on."

31:36.796 --> 31:39.000
And then he said,
"At least we still have pie,"

31:39.303 --> 31:42.414
and I said, "We'll always have pie."

31:43.654 --> 31:45.851
And then we sat there,
waiting for the doctor,

31:45.876 --> 31:48.859
ranking pies from our favorite
to our least favorite.

31:51.813 --> 31:54.703
And I realized I hadn't eaten
anything since chili for lunch,

31:54.728 --> 31:57.656
and that the house was gone,

32:00.055 --> 32:01.343
but it didn't matter.

32:01.672 --> 32:05.781
Nothing mattered, because you were safe.

32:07.230 --> 32:09.125
We were safe, we were alive...

32:11.753 --> 32:14.226
sitting, waiting,

32:15.194 --> 32:17.859
in bright green chairs.

32:23.080 --> 32:26.843
I'm sorry, but anything
that's bothering you right now

32:27.326 --> 32:30.789
that doesn't have to do
with Kate or my grandson,

32:31.903 --> 32:33.312
it doesn't belong here.

32:35.020 --> 32:36.265
It doesn't matter.

32:38.170 --> 32:41.586
And I need you to put it away,
right now.

32:56.823 --> 32:57.976
You're right, Mom.

33:00.093 --> 33:01.234
I'm sorry.

33:09.257 --> 33:10.492
Hey, everybody.

33:20.656 --> 33:21.836
Uh, he's here.

33:22.703 --> 33:25.726
It's a boy, and he's very premature.

33:25.728 --> 33:28.329
- What happened?
- Uh...

33:28.331 --> 33:29.897
So his-his heart rate dropped,

33:29.899 --> 33:31.843
and they had to do
an emergency C-section.

33:32.201 --> 33:33.868
And e-everything happened so fast

33:33.870 --> 33:36.015
that I-I didn't have time to-to...

33:36.656 --> 33:37.882
It's okay.

33:38.067 --> 33:39.781
He's, he...

33:41.382 --> 33:43.218
He's really, really small.

33:44.429 --> 33:47.448
Y-You know? And-and so-so they put him,

33:47.450 --> 33:49.617
they, they put him on a machine

33:50.153 --> 33:51.619
because he can't breathe on his own yet,

33:51.621 --> 33:54.422
and-and he's in this plastic box
to keep him warm

33:54.424 --> 33:57.679
and they took him back to, uh, to...

33:59.789 --> 34:01.062
But he's here.

34:01.461 --> 34:02.664
How is Kate?

34:03.305 --> 34:05.205
Uh, amazing.

34:05.621 --> 34:06.937
Um, through the whole thing.

34:07.104 --> 34:08.648
When can we go see her?

34:08.759 --> 34:10.882
Uh, I-I don't know.

34:10.907 --> 34:14.320
Um, as soon as possible,
hopefully, but, uh...

34:14.835 --> 34:16.750
She asked to see Miguel first.

34:17.333 --> 34:18.460
Really?

34:19.875 --> 34:21.342
No, not really.

34:21.368 --> 34:25.958
She... I'm sorry, that was
my poor attempt at some humor.

34:25.984 --> 34:27.117
I'm really tired.

34:27.119 --> 34:28.929
I'm sorry, I should-I should
probably head back.

34:28.954 --> 34:30.148
Go, man, go.

34:31.039 --> 34:32.281
Tell her we love her.

34:32.750 --> 34:34.467
Uh, yeah, I will-I will, and...

34:35.054 --> 34:36.648
will somebody call my parents?

34:36.795 --> 34:38.507
- I'm on it.
- I'll send you their numbers.

34:38.532 --> 34:41.414
No, I have them. I-I saved them,
just for this, uh,

34:41.438 --> 34:43.554
- this kind of occasion.
- Thanks, Migs.

34:44.523 --> 34:46.976
Uh, Toby. Yeah...

34:48.179 --> 34:49.398
Would you tell her I'm here?

34:49.831 --> 34:50.976
She knows.

35:01.920 --> 35:03.328
Want to know the end of the game?

35:04.226 --> 35:05.265
Hmm.

35:05.778 --> 35:08.445
You can't put chocolate on ranch.

35:11.042 --> 35:12.828
- Well done.
- Thank you.

35:14.146 --> 35:15.914
Thank you for putting up with us.

35:16.259 --> 35:17.484
It's my pleasure.

35:17.819 --> 35:19.859
- Your pleasure? Really?
- Mm-hmm.

35:20.562 --> 35:22.367
I'm gonna send you guys

35:22.392 --> 35:24.317
- up to the NICU.
- Okay.

35:24.342 --> 35:25.828
- Fourth floor.
- Thank you.

35:26.077 --> 35:28.109
And thank you for putting up with us.

35:28.218 --> 35:29.921
- You've been fine.
- No, really.

35:29.946 --> 35:31.859
Do you have some kind of
employee of the month program?

35:31.884 --> 35:33.884
Because your face belongs
on a bulletin board.

35:33.909 --> 35:36.054
- Starting to sound like pandering.
- Uh, yes, dear. I just...

35:36.667 --> 35:38.492
Thank you for your service.
We'll head right up.

35:38.517 --> 35:40.929
- Thanks.
- I suggest you get some food

35:40.954 --> 35:42.515
and change your clothes first.

35:42.805 --> 35:44.101
This could be a long road.

35:46.331 --> 35:47.406
Thanks.

35:47.883 --> 35:49.265
Okay. Thank you.

35:51.468 --> 35:52.695
Miguel.

35:53.757 --> 35:54.781
Hey.

35:54.806 --> 35:56.506
So I waited outside their building

35:56.531 --> 35:59.953
until I saw the maintenance guy
and I told a very elaborate lie

35:59.978 --> 36:01.601
and he let me into their apartment.

36:02.147 --> 36:03.328
Can you give this to Kate?

36:03.353 --> 36:05.921
Oh, and tell her if she ever
gets a call from Sven,

36:05.946 --> 36:08.570
- just to agree with everything.
- Okay, I will.

36:08.595 --> 36:10.257
Uh, wow... well done.

36:11.620 --> 36:12.796
Madison.

36:13.646 --> 36:14.961
Thanks for putting up with us.

36:20.695 --> 36:22.054
Is this the right one?

36:22.400 --> 36:23.507
Yeah. Yeah.

36:26.678 --> 36:28.414
I think it'll be good for you guys,

36:29.054 --> 36:30.414
to be so close to Kate.

36:30.772 --> 36:32.453
- She's gonna need you.
- Yeah?

36:32.796 --> 36:35.414
Yeah. Kate and little Tobe deserve some

36:35.439 --> 36:37.239
local Grandpa and Grandma time, too.

36:37.651 --> 36:40.500
Are you sure you guys are gonna
be okay with everything?

36:40.839 --> 36:43.226
Of course. We always are.

36:43.660 --> 36:44.906
We got this.

36:45.226 --> 36:46.250
All right.

36:50.510 --> 36:51.726
We got this, right?

36:52.297 --> 36:53.468
Most def.

36:55.320 --> 36:58.039
There's got to be a, like,
a term or a word

36:58.064 --> 36:59.820
for when your twin has a baby.

36:59.845 --> 37:01.171
There's got to be
a word for that, right?

37:01.726 --> 37:03.781
- Twuncle.
- Twuncle, that's it.

37:03.806 --> 37:05.492
It was right in front of me,
I didn't see it.

37:06.350 --> 37:07.640
Uh, hey.

37:12.070 --> 37:13.812
I thought I had it under control,

37:14.764 --> 37:19.367
but, uh, I don't know, it all
feels so fragile right now.

37:22.944 --> 37:24.976
I don't think I can do this
without you, Zoe.

37:26.017 --> 37:27.062
Any of it.

37:40.214 --> 37:42.375
I feel like I need some
caffeine. Do you want anything?

37:42.441 --> 37:43.554
- Are you sure?
- Mm.

37:43.579 --> 37:44.664
Okay.

37:52.066 --> 37:53.476
I'm proud of you, cuz.

37:54.159 --> 37:57.382
I know how hard it is,
to step out of old patterns.

37:59.918 --> 38:04.132
His, uh, water bottle was full of vodka.

38:39.106 --> 38:40.340
Hi.

38:40.365 --> 38:42.152
Hey, little man.

38:45.887 --> 38:47.715
You came early.

38:49.047 --> 38:50.738
You're impatient, too, huh?

38:51.855 --> 38:53.301
I think you get that from me.

38:55.926 --> 38:57.317
Oh, my God, I already love him

38:57.342 --> 39:00.832
so much... this is, this is insane.

39:04.418 --> 39:06.738
I think I would murder
somebody for him, Toby.

39:07.121 --> 39:08.770
- Full-on dragon.
- Mm-hmm.

39:09.919 --> 39:13.145
Is his-is his chest supposed to be
jerking like that when he breathes?

39:17.793 --> 39:19.590
Yeah, I think he's just figuring it out.

39:20.567 --> 39:21.621
Okay.

39:22.149 --> 39:23.731
He's just, he's just...

39:23.833 --> 39:26.262
I just cannot...
Can't believe how small he is.

39:27.133 --> 39:29.512
He just, he doesn't look
like a regular...

39:29.537 --> 39:31.027
Well, because he's not.

39:37.132 --> 39:38.559
Toby, I've been hesitant...

39:41.502 --> 39:43.027
but I want to name him Jack.

39:44.023 --> 39:45.324
Okay? Is that okay?

39:45.512 --> 39:46.590
Yeah.

39:48.738 --> 39:49.832
Jack.

39:51.827 --> 39:52.965
I can't...

39:54.926 --> 39:56.027
Tobe.

39:56.918 --> 39:58.238
Take my hand.

39:59.442 --> 40:00.824
Look at our son.

40:02.520 --> 40:05.207
I'm gonna do something weird,
but just go with it, please?

40:05.232 --> 40:06.340
Mm-hmm.

40:12.981 --> 40:14.160
Hey, Dad.

40:17.747 --> 40:21.340
I don't know where you are,
but I know that you're there.

40:24.557 --> 40:27.215
I don't know why I'm looking up,
'cause I know you're not up.

40:27.896 --> 40:29.215
You're everywhere.

40:31.742 --> 40:34.902
Ugh, I promised myself I would
never talk to you like this,

40:35.649 --> 40:40.481
never ask for something like this...

40:43.881 --> 40:46.973
but I need you to do
something for me and I swear,

40:48.415 --> 40:51.395
I swear that I will never
ask for anything again.

40:55.535 --> 40:57.101
This is Jack.

40:58.878 --> 41:00.426
This is your grandson.

41:05.699 --> 41:08.199
And I need him to be okay.

41:12.699 --> 41:14.496
And I don't know why, but I,

41:14.657 --> 41:15.871
I know...

41:19.751 --> 41:21.199
I know that you...

41:24.201 --> 41:25.574
you can do that.

41:29.846 --> 41:31.942
- Oh, I need...
- I got you, I got you.

41:37.191 --> 41:38.387
Look.

41:39.076 --> 41:42.254
She's tough, you're tough.

41:48.712 --> 41:50.067
Oh, my goodness.

41:53.335 --> 41:54.434
Oh...

41:54.733 --> 41:56.363
He's gonna be okay.

42:00.891 --> 42:02.168
He's gonna be okay.

42:04.882 --> 42:06.098
He is.

42:08.257 --> 42:09.664
He's gonna be okay.
