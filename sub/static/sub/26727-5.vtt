WEBVTT

00:00.875 --> 00:02.544
There we go.

00:04.170 --> 00:05.088
WEATHER FORECAST

00:05.630 --> 00:06.506
The weather forecast?

00:06.589 --> 00:10.260
Actually, there's a weather lady I like.

00:11.886 --> 00:14.389
Good evening, everyone.
I'm here at the Fountain Plaza.

00:14.597 --> 00:15.932
Look, that's her.

00:16.891 --> 00:18.643
Looks like he really likes her.

00:18.727 --> 00:20.395
As long as he's enjoying himself.

00:20.729 --> 00:22.689
Tomorrow, it will snow
for the first time in a while.

00:23.273 --> 00:26.943
It has been freezing all day.
We may even have colder weather.

00:29.529 --> 00:32.907
So, have a good night, everyone,
and please stay warm!

00:42.292 --> 00:43.293
A street slasher!

00:43.376 --> 00:44.627
Are we still live?

00:51.342 --> 00:53.678
What the hell is this?

02:35.196 --> 02:36.030
Anzai?

02:37.157 --> 02:39.742
-Yanagi, the sedative.
-Oh, right.

02:40.451 --> 02:41.703
What's that?

02:42.036 --> 02:43.079
I gave that to him.

02:43.371 --> 02:46.583
It's a gas mask that's effective
in blocking color and smell.

02:47.041 --> 02:50.545
Attention, Public Safety Division 5!
A Level 5 vampire incident arose.

02:50.795 --> 02:54.215
Send human personnel to Ikebukuro
West Gate Park's Fountain Plaza now.

02:54.424 --> 02:55.466
The victim is bleeding a lot.

02:55.550 --> 02:58.261
It was at the live weather forecast area.
There were many bystanders.

02:58.386 --> 03:00.513
Vampires may have witnessed it
and transformed as well.

03:02.307 --> 03:03.141
Why?

03:03.725 --> 03:04.851
Why is she there?

03:05.393 --> 03:06.436
Don't push me, idiot.

03:06.686 --> 03:08.021
Wait, I'll take a photo with my phone!

03:08.980 --> 03:09.898
Sit here for a while.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.193
I'll go stop that vampire
in the knitted hat and come back.

03:14.527 --> 03:16.279
The person he's drinking blood from
might die.

03:16.446 --> 03:18.114
The cameras should have
already stopped rolling.

03:18.448 --> 03:19.490
Give me around three minutes.

03:21.409 --> 03:22.744
No, I'll be back in a minute.

03:25.872 --> 03:27.999
I feel like throwing up.

03:28.833 --> 03:32.837
I never thought a slasher would strike
during a live TV broadcast.

03:33.421 --> 03:36.507
And coincidentally, there's a vampire
right in front of her.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.052
Is it a coincidence?

03:39.719 --> 03:42.055
That weather forecast happens every day.

03:42.722 --> 03:47.310
Does that mean the culprit knew
there was a vampire among the staff?

03:47.977 --> 03:50.563
Then, does it mean the slasher
only killed the woman,

03:51.272 --> 03:53.191
to expose the human blood to vampires?

03:54.567 --> 03:55.985
Monster.

04:01.574 --> 04:03.993
Due to having witnessed
the vampire attack on TV,

04:04.202 --> 04:06.371
vampires in the entire Kanto region
are transforming.

04:06.621 --> 04:08.373
If this continues,
things will get out of hand.

04:12.418 --> 04:15.463
Has anyone informed the police
and called an ambulance?

04:16.631 --> 04:17.757
I'll tie the guy up. Someone...

04:17.840 --> 04:21.636
You're really impressive.
You can take down a monster like that.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.638
There's no need to help him, right?

04:23.805 --> 04:26.432
You might as well kill the monster,
just to be sure.

04:27.684 --> 04:28.518
Stop filming.

04:28.601 --> 04:30.103
This is not a show and I won't kill him.

04:30.353 --> 04:33.064
Why? Who cares? Just kill him already.

04:33.398 --> 04:34.315
Hurry!

04:34.857 --> 04:36.442
What's up with this guy?

04:40.905 --> 04:43.241
Can you run? You have to run.

04:43.324 --> 04:45.827
Get away from here, hurry!

05:03.136 --> 05:04.887
Where should I go?

05:06.014 --> 05:08.099
Isn't the monster after the girl?

05:08.474 --> 05:10.393
Let's get away from her, just to be safe.

05:29.203 --> 05:31.164
What the hell is that? Another monster?

05:50.141 --> 05:51.142
Mr. Anzai,

05:52.602 --> 05:53.519
thank you.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.107
Sawazaki, it's Anzai.

05:58.524 --> 06:01.277
Tsukasa Taira is safe. Can you get her?

06:02.195 --> 06:04.030
Sorry, it's impossible for now.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.990
Report your status...

06:13.581 --> 06:15.708
Take these. They're sedatives.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.003
When you're alone in a situation
like this, inject a vampire with it.

06:19.545 --> 06:22.715
I can't! I have no idea
how to inject someone.

06:23.925 --> 06:26.260
It doesn't matter how.
Just insert the needle...

06:31.933 --> 06:34.894
I'm sorry! I got scratched
by the vampire earlier.

06:35.561 --> 06:37.980
It's all right. I'm wearing a mask now.

06:38.689 --> 06:42.110
I can't recognize a smell or color.
Don't think of it as blood!

06:44.320 --> 06:46.239
No, don't go.

06:47.865 --> 06:49.200
I'll hide my wound!

06:49.659 --> 06:52.286
If it makes it better, I'll go somewhere
to wash the blood off now!

06:52.745 --> 06:57.125
Just don't leave me again.

07:01.754 --> 07:03.381
Inject me with a sedative.

07:04.632 --> 07:07.468
If you do it within ten seconds,
I'll stay here.

07:11.931 --> 07:13.641
This will sting a bit.

07:15.560 --> 07:18.146
Done. How is it?

07:21.065 --> 07:22.150
Are you okay?

07:23.526 --> 07:25.528
"This will sting a bit," you said.

07:25.611 --> 07:27.530
I'm sorry. Did it hurt?

07:27.780 --> 07:28.781
No, it's not that.

07:31.117 --> 07:34.245
It was just a little funny.

07:37.206 --> 07:38.374
It's really effective.

07:39.584 --> 07:42.336
My movements will be weak
for ten minutes or so.

07:43.045 --> 07:44.505
Wait here for now.

07:50.094 --> 07:53.014
I'm sorry! I got carried away.

07:57.894 --> 07:58.853
Do it again.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.608
Can you do it again?

08:11.199 --> 08:12.575
Can you do it again?

08:17.371 --> 08:18.372
That...

08:21.959 --> 08:23.294
This is Makimura of Squad B!

08:23.669 --> 08:25.505
An officer opened fire on a vampire!

08:25.588 --> 08:28.090
She's a vampire who transformed
after seeing the incident!

08:28.382 --> 08:30.468
The officer didn't know
she was a vampire and was shocked.

08:30.801 --> 08:31.719
What now?

08:32.094 --> 08:33.846
Looks like a police officer shot
a vampire.

08:33.971 --> 08:36.641
Police! Everyone, please calm down!

08:37.725 --> 08:38.643
Lower your gun!

08:39.310 --> 08:43.189
If you see anyone who's changed,
don't make a move. Please inform us!

08:44.899 --> 08:45.733
Tsukasa.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.029
When I can move again,
I'll move you somewhere else.

08:51.280 --> 08:53.032
I don't know if it's safe here or not.

08:56.494 --> 08:57.411
What is it?

08:59.080 --> 08:59.997
Nothing.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.292
But Lee is still down there.

09:03.417 --> 09:05.086
He might be looking for me.

09:06.420 --> 09:08.089
Are you friends with him?

09:08.381 --> 09:10.841
No! I was only looking for you.

09:11.467 --> 09:14.178
When I went to the back alley,
he was there.

09:14.762 --> 09:17.014
He said he was looking for a cross.

09:18.766 --> 09:22.687
When I said I was looking for you,
he offered to help me.

09:27.275 --> 09:28.276
A cross?

09:28.484 --> 09:30.403
His necklace was like this, too.

09:31.153 --> 09:33.698
A black cross with long ends.

09:34.740 --> 09:38.327
It's the mark of ONLO, the institution
that I used to be in.

09:39.078 --> 09:42.748
It's near Obihiro. They gather
and raise orphaned vampires.

09:44.166 --> 09:45.459
So, that's what it was.

09:45.960 --> 09:46.794
Don't mind it.

09:47.712 --> 09:49.463
Maybe it's better not to talk
about these things.

09:50.131 --> 09:52.008
I don't care anyway.

09:52.967 --> 09:56.137
I still don't know anything about you.

09:56.929 --> 09:59.098
That's why I'm happy to hear it.

10:05.313 --> 10:08.065
If you don't want to talk about it,
it's okay not...

10:11.277 --> 10:12.111
What?

10:18.159 --> 10:20.661
It's been a while since you last hit me.

10:21.245 --> 10:22.580
He laughed again.

10:24.081 --> 10:25.166
How cute.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.085
It would be nice if he laughs more.

10:29.337 --> 10:31.589
If he had this cross,

10:32.256 --> 10:34.925
there's a great chance
we're from the same place,

10:35.426 --> 10:38.596
but, among the kids in my age group,
there wasn't a foreigner like him.

10:39.472 --> 10:42.975
Actually, everyone was a full vampire
and I was the only half-vampire.

10:43.684 --> 10:45.186
Are half-vampires rare?

10:45.478 --> 10:46.562
Well, that's to be expected.

10:46.687 --> 10:48.272
Having one vampire parent...

10:50.107 --> 10:52.610
Is that even possible?

10:53.361 --> 10:55.154
Vampires and humans can't have sex.

10:55.988 --> 10:59.659
A vampire-human hybrid would be
impossible to give birth to.

11:02.411 --> 11:03.537
Are you okay?

11:17.385 --> 11:20.221
How are you okay with being with me?

11:21.389 --> 11:22.515
That time before, too!

11:22.848 --> 11:24.225
I was about to attack you.

11:24.475 --> 11:25.976
I could have killed you!

11:27.186 --> 11:28.771
Also, I might not even be a half-vampire.

11:28.938 --> 11:30.314
Just a pure vampire.

11:30.564 --> 11:31.482
Why?

11:33.943 --> 11:34.860
But,

11:35.319 --> 11:37.405
I like you.

11:39.156 --> 11:42.660
Oh, that. Well...

11:43.077 --> 11:44.245
I don't care anyway.

11:44.662 --> 11:46.831
Whether you're a half-vampire,
a vampire, or just a human,

11:47.081 --> 11:48.457
it's irrelevant.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.836
It doesn't change
the fact that you are you.

11:52.586 --> 11:57.842
I worry more
about being good enough for you.

12:07.726 --> 12:09.311
What the heck is going on?

12:09.478 --> 12:11.564
The TV was saying something
about vampires...

12:12.356 --> 12:16.152
This is bad. The sedatives
still haven't worn off completely.

12:16.902 --> 12:19.196
My knees can't take it any longer.

12:20.156 --> 12:21.574
Hey, hold on to the railing.

12:22.533 --> 12:23.367
I'm going to fall.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.845
You fall quite often, don't you?

12:45.389 --> 12:46.307
You.

12:47.725 --> 12:48.642
Who are you?

12:49.059 --> 12:53.647
Hey, did you really inherit vampire blood?
Why are your physical abilities too weak?

12:53.981 --> 12:56.317
It's because I sedated him earlier.

12:57.318 --> 12:59.236
Hey, you. What's with your eyes?

12:59.778 --> 13:03.365
You don't even know what this is?
Are you really a half-vampire?

13:05.618 --> 13:08.537
The situation at Ikebukuro West Gate
is coming to an end.

13:08.871 --> 13:10.581
Right now, the human personnel
of the squads

13:10.664 --> 13:14.376
will be handling vampire transformations
occurring in the Kanto area.

13:14.668 --> 13:19.089
In addition, this investigation
will be limited to human personnel only.

13:19.423 --> 13:20.841
Vampire personnel are to await orders.

13:21.175 --> 13:22.843
I have a lot to ask you.

13:23.552 --> 13:24.637
Ask away, then.

13:24.720 --> 13:25.638
Sawazaki.

13:25.846 --> 13:26.680
Kikuhara.

13:27.306 --> 13:29.308
Is everyone from Squad F okay?

13:29.725 --> 13:32.061
No problems here. And you?

13:32.311 --> 13:33.938
We don't have any casualties.

13:34.396 --> 13:37.316
Actually, I was late
because I got stuck in traffic...

13:39.068 --> 13:40.945
He's a civilian who happened
to be at the scene.

13:41.695 --> 13:42.821
This is one of my members.

13:43.113 --> 13:44.615
Anzai. Greet him.

13:45.074 --> 13:46.242
It's your first meeting, right?

13:48.035 --> 13:48.953
I'm Anzai.

13:49.286 --> 13:51.455
I'm Kikuhara of Squad A.
I'll be in your care.

13:53.749 --> 13:56.252
Something is scary about this guy.

13:56.835 --> 14:00.422
Excuse me, have we met somewhere before?

14:00.756 --> 14:01.590
Before?

14:02.675 --> 14:03.842
Maybe at the new staff ceremony.

14:04.301 --> 14:06.929
Chief Kikuhara,
about the next deployment...

14:07.346 --> 14:08.180
Right.

14:08.764 --> 14:11.600
Well, then, Sawazaki.
See you again at the next meeting.

14:15.104 --> 14:16.021
Are you okay?

14:16.981 --> 14:18.732
Was there anything wrong with Kikuhara?

14:19.233 --> 14:20.651
No, nothing at all.

14:22.945 --> 14:26.282
His hand was unusually warm.

14:30.744 --> 14:32.788
I'm so glad, you guys are fine.

14:33.205 --> 14:35.499
I've prepared the fireplace.
Hurry to the second floor.

14:36.000 --> 14:36.876
Oh, hey.

14:36.959 --> 14:38.335
Sorry, but we've got two more.

14:38.794 --> 14:40.004
This is Tsukasa Taira.

14:40.296 --> 14:41.463
Are you Yuki's girlfriend?

14:41.797 --> 14:43.048
Well...

14:43.299 --> 14:44.592
I'm the shop owner, Sakaki.

14:44.758 --> 14:46.302
I'm Tsukasa Taira.

14:47.678 --> 14:51.015
I'm Hans Lee,
a friend of Anzai and Tsukasa.

14:51.849 --> 14:54.393
They're witnesses in the sniper incident
and the one just now.

14:54.935 --> 14:56.812
Please let him stay here until I return.

14:57.688 --> 15:00.524
I would also like to talk to Taira later
about what she saw.

15:00.900 --> 15:01.817
Yes.

15:02.359 --> 15:06.196
We have a guest room
and a large lounge with a fireplace.

15:06.363 --> 15:07.948
Be comfortable and make yourself at home.

15:08.240 --> 15:09.074
Thank you.

15:09.575 --> 15:13.662
This building is my property.
I rent out the third floor and up.

15:14.163 --> 15:15.748
There isn't an empty room as of now,

15:16.040 --> 15:19.501
but Yuki lives here,
so you could stay with him instead.

15:19.710 --> 15:20.628
No way.

15:21.462 --> 15:22.880
My room is still a mess.

15:26.967 --> 15:30.012
Oh, right. I need to tell him
about the way to get used to blood.

15:31.347 --> 15:34.141
Will life be easier for you then?

15:34.892 --> 15:37.311
Can we be together more?

15:40.564 --> 15:41.482
What's up?

15:42.232 --> 15:43.067
Well,

15:43.692 --> 15:46.070
that thing about building
a tolerance for blood.

15:46.445 --> 15:49.615
Oh, right. It's better to do it.

15:49.823 --> 15:51.241
His lifespan will extend, too.

15:51.408 --> 15:52.409
Lifespan?

15:52.576 --> 15:56.080
Don't you know?
A vampire's average lifespan is 39 years.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.752
Hey, everyone's here.

16:02.086 --> 16:04.588
I'm going back to the crime scene.
I'll leave these guys to you.

16:05.464 --> 16:06.757
You're getting busy.

16:07.049 --> 16:09.259
An investigation headquarters
will probably be established.

16:09.635 --> 16:12.471
I won't be back until past midnight.

16:13.097 --> 16:14.056
I've been contacted.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.142
-The Ikebukuro case is unclear...
-I heard on the radio.

16:17.768 --> 16:20.604
-They finally decided without vampires.
-Cases like this one keep happening...

16:21.897 --> 16:24.817
-Vampires are seen equally in the force.
-The police are trying to deal with it.

16:25.317 --> 16:27.528
Places vampires can go to
may disappear as well.

16:27.778 --> 16:29.989
It doesn't mean they've decided
to get rid of vampires.

16:30.447 --> 16:35.369
Who knows? The point is, vampires
have always been seen as trouble.

16:35.828 --> 16:36.912
Isn't it troublesome?

16:37.246 --> 16:39.081
Reacting to human blood each and every...

16:40.332 --> 16:41.875
You belong here.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.628
Don't you get it?

16:46.672 --> 16:48.340
Anzai. You, too.

16:48.882 --> 16:50.467
I'll protect all of you.

16:51.260 --> 16:52.261
Stay here and wait for me.

16:53.554 --> 16:54.388
Sawazaki.

16:57.391 --> 16:58.976
Sorry for trying to attack you.

16:59.852 --> 17:00.936
It wasn't your fault.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.858
Yanagi, I have something to ask you.

17:06.483 --> 17:07.609
-Is it okay?
-Yes?

17:08.277 --> 17:11.989
If Anzai isn't a half-vampire,
even if he's a pure-blooded vampire,

17:12.364 --> 17:14.700
will he be able to build
a tolerance for blood like Lee?

17:15.242 --> 17:16.493
Sorry, I kept you all waiting.

17:17.327 --> 17:19.663
I'll lend a hand.
You're making supper, right?

17:19.955 --> 17:20.956
That would be helpful.

17:21.290 --> 17:22.791
-Me too.
-And, me.

17:23.250 --> 17:24.376
What are we making?

17:24.585 --> 17:26.086
If you mention supper staples...

17:26.503 --> 17:27.588
Ramen?

17:29.381 --> 17:30.466
I'm Tsukasa Taira.

17:30.924 --> 17:33.761
Officer Juliana Lloyd.
Pure-blooded vampire.

17:34.011 --> 17:35.512
My parents are American and Russian.

17:35.846 --> 17:36.722
A half?

17:37.139 --> 17:38.265
When it comes to nationality.

17:38.515 --> 17:40.684
Here are your aprons, you two.

17:46.732 --> 17:47.566
What is it?

17:48.233 --> 17:51.028
I think you're as beautiful as
a Hollywood actress.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.822
What the heck was that?
I'm so embarrassed!

17:53.947 --> 17:54.823
Well...

17:55.574 --> 17:58.452
I've always admired beautiful
and mature-looking women.

17:58.744 --> 17:59.578
So...

18:02.331 --> 18:04.083
Let's stop this already, Zero-Seven.

18:04.249 --> 18:06.043
What do you get from following me?

18:06.460 --> 18:08.170
The first plan already ended.

18:08.670 --> 18:13.467
I know you were against Plan B,
but it was the leader who decided on it!

18:13.884 --> 18:15.552
Are you saying
you're not responsible for it?

18:16.345 --> 18:17.846
I never said anything like that!

18:18.263 --> 18:21.600
By sacrificing a few people,
the vampires' existence will be exposed!

18:22.267 --> 18:25.813
It's the first step
in ridding this society of vampires!

18:26.563 --> 18:28.065
Don't come near me. Drop the gun!

18:28.482 --> 18:29.900
I didn't bring one.

18:30.317 --> 18:32.653
You trust humans so easily!

18:33.862 --> 18:36.907
Actually, I have another mission.

18:39.034 --> 18:41.703
If it looks like you'll interfere
with Plan B...

18:42.621 --> 18:43.539
Mura...

18:44.331 --> 18:49.294
I'm sorry. If you're around,
it'll be too hard for the team.

18:54.299 --> 18:57.928
Sex between humans and vampires?
I think there are ways.

18:58.804 --> 19:01.974
Like binding the vampire or using a gag.

19:02.307 --> 19:03.725
It's not impossible.

19:04.309 --> 19:05.561
What about artificial insemination?

19:05.978 --> 19:08.105
That's even more difficult in this state.

19:10.232 --> 19:11.567
Don't worry too much, Anzai.

19:12.192 --> 19:15.654
A child is innocent no matter
how he or she is born.

19:18.740 --> 19:20.242
Oh, I'm sorry.

19:21.201 --> 19:23.495
I'm taking orders for the ramen soup.

19:24.079 --> 19:25.080
Miso for me.

19:25.289 --> 19:26.123
Soy sauce.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.459
Well, Mr. Anzai...

19:30.210 --> 19:31.378
I'll go ahead.

19:31.879 --> 19:34.673
It's okay if you guys
make out here or something.

19:34.756 --> 19:35.591
What?

19:36.800 --> 19:37.634
See you!

19:41.847 --> 19:42.931
Lee told me

19:44.224 --> 19:45.934
that a vampire's average lifespan
is 39 years.

19:46.393 --> 19:47.436
What's that supposed to mean?

19:48.061 --> 19:50.647
Vampires try to stop themselves
from drinking blood, right?

19:51.148 --> 19:54.151
He said that it only shortens
a vampire's lifespan.

19:54.526 --> 19:55.444
Stop it.

19:55.694 --> 19:57.905
I've never seen data
about vampires' lifespans.

19:58.071 --> 20:00.240
Anyway, the government
doesn't release those numbers.

20:00.824 --> 20:04.411
That night, you were healed
by drinking blood.

20:04.828 --> 20:05.829
That stuff he said...

20:05.913 --> 20:09.124
Lee drinks blood to heal his wounds.

20:09.458 --> 20:12.044
He takes a sip every day
to make his body used to it.

20:12.461 --> 20:16.131
That's why he can heal his wounds,
has a strong body, and can live longer.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.135
Mr. Anzai,

20:21.386 --> 20:22.763
drink my blood.

20:25.015 --> 20:27.351
I'll give you a little every day!

22:04.031 --> 22:05.157
Zero-Two!

22:06.033 --> 22:09.453
I know it has been hard for you, Fifteen.

22:09.953 --> 22:11.496
No problem, it was for the team.

22:11.830 --> 22:13.582
If it's for you, I can do any...

22:13.832 --> 22:15.625
My apologies, Murakami.

22:22.049 --> 22:23.759
Ren Murakami. Unemployed.

22:24.176 --> 22:27.262
Weather forecaster
Yuriko Hyuuga's stalker.

22:27.512 --> 22:30.348
He hated her for not reciprocating
his feelings, so he slashed her.

22:30.432 --> 22:32.768
He then felt guilty while on the run,

22:33.185 --> 22:36.063
so he stabbed himself
and jumped off a building.

22:37.439 --> 22:39.524
Plan B ends here.

22:40.192 --> 22:41.693
No, please...

22:42.194 --> 22:45.238
A few sacrifices will save the society.

22:54.122 --> 22:57.876
Why did you have to kill Murakami?

22:58.794 --> 23:01.254
Don't kill humans, Kikuhara.

23:02.005 --> 23:04.674
We should only be killing vampires!

23:11.223 --> 23:13.975
Before you die, tell me something.

23:15.602 --> 23:16.728
Do I,

23:19.147 --> 23:21.399
look human to you?

23:34.204 --> 23:35.205
Devil's Line.

23:35.914 --> 23:36.832
Line 6.

23:37.457 --> 23:38.542
Dogmatic.

23:38.792 --> 23:40.794
