00:02.160 --> 00:03.880
Previously on
The Vampire Diaries:

00:03.920 --> 00:05.410
- I'm Elena.
- I'm Stefan.

00:05.560 --> 00:09.246
<i>Love brought me to Mystic Falls.
Love drove me away.</i>

00:09.440 --> 00:11.807
I am not sorry that I'm in love with you,
Damon.

00:13.320 --> 00:16.369
- We've all made sacrifices.
- Bonnie, what did you do?

00:16.520 --> 00:19.444
I brought you back.
You can see ghosts, we can talk.

00:19.600 --> 00:22.080
- No, you can't be dead.
- Party at Whitmore House.

00:22.680 --> 00:24.523
<i>Even though we're trying to move on...</i>

00:24.720 --> 00:26.449
- I love college.
- Hi.

00:26.600 --> 00:28.443
- Who are you?
- I'm Megan. Your roommate.

00:28.640 --> 00:30.961
<i>- Please help me!
- Oh, my God.</i>

00:31.160 --> 00:32.241
This was a vampire.

00:32.439 --> 00:33.920
<i>...New enemies have emerged.</i>

00:34.040 --> 00:35.201
Nadia?

00:38.080 --> 00:39.809
<i>Just as our greatest threat...</i>

00:39.960 --> 00:41.962
- Silas.
- Hello, my shadow self.

00:44.640 --> 00:46.369
<i>...ls finally making his move.</i>

00:46.600 --> 00:48.602
- Where's Stefan?
- Bring me Katherine...

00:48.760 --> 00:51.206
and then I will tell you
where your brother is.

00:51.400 --> 00:53.004
You can't take me back there, Jeremy.

00:57.160 --> 01:00.084
You all know Elena Gilbert.
Well, the girl I'm looking for...

01:00.280 --> 01:03.489
looks exactly like her.

01:08.400 --> 01:12.803
<i>It was supposed to be</i> a <i>nice family
event, so I stopped in to see my dad.</i>

01:14.920 --> 01:16.843
<i>Then Silas showed up.</i>

01:17.000 --> 01:20.925
<i>He said he was testing how powerful
his mind control had become.</i>

01:21.080 --> 01:24.004
Nobody make a sound or move a muscle.

01:24.160 --> 01:26.527
The entire town did exactly what he said.

01:31.400 --> 01:35.803
<i>He didn't want any witnesses,
so he told them to forget what he did.</i>

01:35.960 --> 01:38.406
They watched my dad die.
They couldn't do anything.

01:40.440 --> 01:42.124
<i>Or tell anyone.</i>

01:47.000 --> 01:48.684
What are you gonna do?

01:49.600 --> 01:50.931
You gonna hug me?

01:53.120 --> 01:54.201
I want to.

01:54.800 --> 01:55.961
But you can't.

01:57.200 --> 02:00.841
You can't touch me and I can't touch you
because I'm dead.

02:02.160 --> 02:06.006
Just like my dad, except he's not
supernatural, so I don't get to see him.

02:06.200 --> 02:07.804
He's just dead.

02:14.320 --> 02:16.687
Silas is using his mind control
to find Katherine.

02:16.840 --> 02:20.845
He told everyone in the square to keep an
eye out for anyone that looks like Elena.

02:21.040 --> 02:23.691
Whatever he wants with Katherine...

02:25.000 --> 02:26.729
we can't let him have it.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.241
You okay, hon?

02:50.440 --> 02:54.525
- You're gonna get yourself sick out here.
- Thank you so much for stopping.

02:56.760 --> 02:59.161
You look just like Elena Gilbert.

02:59.400 --> 03:02.768
- Actually, I'm much prettier.
- Katherine Pierce, right?

03:02.960 --> 03:05.042
I'm supposed to be
keeping my eye out for you.

03:19.840 --> 03:21.524
Damn it. Ah.

03:21.720 --> 03:22.767
Hurts, doesn't it?

03:26.000 --> 03:27.809
Not as much as this will.

03:41.720 --> 03:44.326
We could be doing anything
right now, Stefan.

03:44.520 --> 03:46.807
Be anywhere. Why here?

03:47.640 --> 03:49.244
Why this?

03:51.080 --> 03:52.491
These are the good moments.

03:53.040 --> 03:55.407
The simple ones. The ones that matter.

03:56.800 --> 04:00.327
These are the moments
that keep me from falling apart.

04:09.600 --> 04:11.682
This can't last forever.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.967
You're just distracting yourself.

04:26.200 --> 04:27.281
Elena. Elena.

04:30.680 --> 04:32.091
<i>Elena.</i>

04:35.520 --> 04:37.045
No.

04:52.640 --> 04:55.610
Megan's memorial outside
is growing by the minute.

04:55.760 --> 04:59.731
Ugh. College kids are so dramatic.
She was on campus for, like, one day.

04:59.880 --> 05:03.168
- She couldn't have made that many friends.
- Caroline, she's dead.

05:03.400 --> 05:04.890
You can stop competing with her.

05:05.040 --> 05:06.804
Ugh, sorry. I'm in a mood.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.482
You talk to Tyler?

05:10.680 --> 05:13.889
He's deferring from enrolling,
and deferring from returning my calls...

05:14.080 --> 05:16.481
so I'm deferring from having
sex with him ever again.

05:16.640 --> 05:19.086
Heh. How's the snooping going?

05:19.240 --> 05:21.720
Any explanation why our vervain-laced...

05:23.800 --> 05:26.770
vampire-slaughtered roommate
had a picture of my dad?

05:26.960 --> 05:28.007
No.

05:28.160 --> 05:31.323
Oh, um, I went by the hospital
this morning.

05:31.520 --> 05:34.524
Megan's death certificate.
It says she died of suicide.

05:34.720 --> 05:37.929
No mention of the gaping
vampire bites on her neck.

05:38.080 --> 05:42.005
So whoever signed off on the cause
of death was part of the cover-up.

05:42.200 --> 05:44.362
Just like the Founder's Council
back home.

05:44.520 --> 05:46.170
Dr. Wesley Maxfield?

05:46.360 --> 05:49.569
A.k.a. our Applied Microbiology
professor.

05:49.720 --> 05:52.405
- I switched our classes around so...
- Applied what what?

05:52.560 --> 05:56.929
Uh, Elena, we are supposed to be taking
Intro to Communication.

05:57.160 --> 06:00.721
What happened to getting drunk
and making bad decisions about boys?

06:00.920 --> 06:02.888
What happened
to our fun freshman year?

06:03.080 --> 06:04.809
I am supposed to be a drama major.

06:04.960 --> 06:08.601
You're not going to be an anything major
if we get exposed as vampires.

06:12.360 --> 06:16.968
We are still gonna have our fun year,
Caroline. We have to protect ourselves.

06:17.120 --> 06:19.282
The way Damon kept his secret
in Mystic Falls...

06:19.560 --> 06:22.131
was because he infiltrated
the Founder's Council.

06:22.280 --> 06:25.568
So bust out those alleged acting skills...

06:26.640 --> 06:28.768
and let's get on it. Okay?

06:33.440 --> 06:37.684
Damon, I know I said I'd help find your
brother, but I can't dredge this entire quarry.

06:37.880 --> 06:38.961
It's enormous.

06:39.160 --> 06:42.323
I'm aware of that. That's why
we wanted to dump Silas' body here.

06:42.560 --> 06:44.562
It's big, deep and no one would find him.

06:44.720 --> 06:48.327
Now, say I'm Silas, and I want to take over
my doppelgangers life...

06:48.520 --> 06:51.763
why wouldn't I dump him
in a place where no one would find him?

06:51.960 --> 06:55.407
I already agreed to hold off on telling
anyone about the mayor's death...

06:55.640 --> 06:56.971
until you figure this out.

06:57.120 --> 07:00.203
I can't devote those resources
to finding one person...

07:00.360 --> 07:03.091
- ...who may not be down there.
- It's a place to start.

07:03.240 --> 07:07.450
And if Stefan's down there, he's been
drowning over and over again all summer...

07:07.640 --> 07:09.688
while I've been
playing house with Elena.

07:09.840 --> 07:13.640
Do I need to further elaborate
the source of my urgency?

07:14.800 --> 07:16.529
I'll get some deputies on it.

07:17.320 --> 07:19.209
Thank you, Liz.

07:22.160 --> 07:25.243
- Please tell me you found her.
- I didn't. But Matt did.

07:26.160 --> 07:28.891
Ah. How shockingly useful.

07:29.440 --> 07:30.851
Those blue eyes.

07:31.320 --> 07:35.211
They made me soft. I should've ripped
your head off when I had the chance.

07:35.360 --> 07:37.761
She was mid-cat fight
with some lady who maced her.

07:37.920 --> 07:41.288
We think Silas might have mind-controlled
himself some new friends.

07:41.480 --> 07:44.563
How did the Gilbert-Donovan
brain trust put all that together?

07:44.760 --> 07:47.331
<i>Never mind. It doesn't matter.
Just hide her.</i>

07:47.520 --> 07:50.410
If Silas wants her enough to sic
the town on her, we want her more.

07:50.560 --> 07:53.370
<i>Stay out of sight. You're the last person
Silas saw her with.</i>

07:55.800 --> 07:57.484
Are these ropes really necessary?

07:57.640 --> 08:00.849
A bullet would've been more effective,
but we're trying to be nice.

08:01.080 --> 08:03.208
You crashed my car and left me to die.

08:03.360 --> 08:06.409
You were gonna hand me over to Silas
to get Stefan back.

08:06.560 --> 08:08.483
I was just protecting myself.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.567
How many people have you killed
using that excuse?

08:11.840 --> 08:15.162
- Just be glad we got you some clothes.
- Don't play the hero.

08:15.320 --> 08:19.245
You two are just waiting for the convenient
time to hand me back over to him.

08:19.840 --> 08:22.923
I've done this a thousand times. I get it.

08:23.160 --> 08:28.451
I'm the leverage.
I'm that thing that everybody wants.

08:29.880 --> 08:32.167
I'm the freaking moonstone.

08:42.760 --> 08:44.444
Hey, blow-off girl.

08:45.840 --> 08:48.571
Aren't you a freshman?
How are you in this class?

08:48.760 --> 08:54.130
What? Um, heh, I love...
"Applied Microbiology."

08:54.760 --> 08:58.446
It's, like, my favorite biology.
You know, little things are just so cute.

08:58.680 --> 09:01.126
Are you going to the bonfire tonight?

09:01.320 --> 09:04.244
Or are you gonna get really close
and then turn around and leave again?

09:04.400 --> 09:06.641
Heh. She'll be there.

09:07.200 --> 09:08.645
Sweet.

09:09.760 --> 09:11.444
We'll hang.

09:18.040 --> 09:19.451
What?

09:19.640 --> 09:22.291
You said you wanted to make
bad decisions about boys.

09:22.440 --> 09:28.607
He's cute, he's interested, and most
importantly, unlike Tyler, he's here.

09:32.800 --> 09:34.290
Morning, everyone.

09:34.440 --> 09:35.885
I'm Dr. Maxfield.

09:36.080 --> 09:38.970
First name is Wes,
but call me Dr. Maxfield.

09:39.760 --> 09:42.889
One day, when you're out of med school,
you'll understand.

09:43.080 --> 09:46.368
So you're all going
to this bonfire tonight, right?

09:46.560 --> 09:48.528
Here's a quick history lesson for you.

09:48.760 --> 09:51.843
Whitmore was founded
as a hospital during the Civil War...

09:52.000 --> 09:55.083
the deadliest war in American history,
over 600,000 casualties.

09:55.280 --> 10:00.002
Disease was so prevalent that once a week
they had to gather all the rotting bodies...

10:00.280 --> 10:03.204
put them in a pile,
and light the whole thing on fire.

10:04.400 --> 10:08.291
So tonight, when you're getting drunk
and partying...

10:08.480 --> 10:10.687
stop for a second, close your eyes...

10:10.920 --> 10:14.288
and imagine the rancid smell
of a hundred rotting corpses.

10:14.440 --> 10:16.522
- Creep-e.
- Which brings us to microbiology.

10:16.680 --> 10:17.966
But hot-e.

10:18.160 --> 10:19.764
That rancid smell comes from...

10:19.920 --> 10:21.649
- ...specific bacteria.
- He is.

10:21.800 --> 10:24.280
Isn't that right, chatty girls in the back?

10:27.600 --> 10:29.204
And what is that bacteria?

10:31.880 --> 10:33.848
Uh, that's the, um...

10:35.120 --> 10:36.963
Um, I don't know.

10:37.120 --> 10:40.044
Maybe because you're freshmen
who shouldn't be in this class.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.766
How do I know? I'm observant.

10:42.920 --> 10:45.844
A skill you'll learn in Bio 101.

10:46.080 --> 10:48.082
Down the hall.

10:49.160 --> 10:53.085
<i>It was mortifying.
We just sat there in silence.</i>

10:53.240 --> 10:55.242
<i>DAMON'. You want me to beat him up?
- Not yet.</i>

10:55.440 --> 10:57.568
Whatever he knows,
I'm gonna get it out of him.

10:57.760 --> 10:59.250
- Did you compel him?
- No.

10:59.400 --> 11:02.768
Chances are if he knows about vampires,
he also knows about vervain.

11:02.960 --> 11:05.088
How about violence?
Did you threaten him?

11:05.240 --> 11:06.480
No, I didn't threaten him.

11:06.680 --> 11:09.524
- At least tell me you used torture.
- Damon.

11:09.680 --> 11:12.445
You do realize that you are dating
a reformed serial killer, right?

11:14.200 --> 11:15.964
What would a hero do?

11:16.160 --> 11:18.845
That, I have no idea.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.683
Stefan?

11:22.400 --> 11:25.404
I don't know. He'd probably mope at him.
Heh.

11:25.560 --> 11:28.484
- Stefan's here, right now.
- What?

11:29.520 --> 11:30.760
Turn off your phone.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.443
Elena? Whoa, that is not S...

11:45.120 --> 11:49.170
I know you're upset that I didn't call,
so I just wanted to apologize in person.

11:53.440 --> 11:57.206
Never do that again, okay?

11:57.440 --> 11:59.488
I thought something
terrible happened to you.

11:59.680 --> 12:03.287
Something terrible did happen to me.
You fell in love with my brother.

12:05.240 --> 12:06.287
Ouch.

12:06.440 --> 12:08.408
Can't blame me for needing a little space.

12:08.560 --> 12:10.085
I know.

12:10.320 --> 12:12.561
- Where did you go?
- It's not important.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.848
I'm sure Damon will fill you in eventually.

12:15.880 --> 12:19.487
You talked to Damon? Because I just
spoke to him, he didn't say anything.

12:19.680 --> 12:21.170
Oh, weird.

12:21.360 --> 12:25.684
Maybe he has his hands full with the whole,
you know, Jeremy situation.

12:26.520 --> 12:29.171
- What Jeremy situation?
- Oh, it's not a big deal.

12:29.320 --> 12:32.005
- Uh, Jeremy got expelled.
- Expelled?

12:32.160 --> 12:35.243
Yeah, then he and Damon got into a fight.
And then Jeremy bolted.

12:35.520 --> 12:38.364
How do I not know about this?
Where the hell is Jeremy?

12:38.520 --> 12:41.046
That's why I'm here.
I was hoping maybe you'd know.

12:53.200 --> 12:56.488
Ugh, thank God we're stopping.
If I can only get out of the car...

12:56.640 --> 13:00.247
Well, you can't. Because as soon as
we get gas, we're back on the road.

13:01.640 --> 13:03.051
But I'm dying back here.

13:03.240 --> 13:05.368
You're not getting out
because you want an aspirin.

13:05.560 --> 13:08.882
Then maybe I can get out because
I need to pee? Like, in a bathroom?

13:09.080 --> 13:10.127
Like a lady?

13:24.080 --> 13:27.721
- Hurry.
- My throat is really scratchy.

13:28.040 --> 13:31.647
And my head hurts, like, right here.

13:31.880 --> 13:35.089
And when I cough, it's green.

13:36.680 --> 13:38.569
So get me some stuff for all that.

13:38.760 --> 13:41.570
Silas knows I'm with you.
Sorry, I can't risk being seen.

13:43.560 --> 13:46.803
- Please?
- Fine.

14:01.080 --> 14:02.241
Just this.

14:15.080 --> 14:16.320
Is that Elena Gilbert?

14:17.840 --> 14:20.889
- Or Katherine Pierce?
- Jeremy! Katherine!

14:28.520 --> 14:30.124
Stop running.

14:35.000 --> 14:39.369
- Damon? Towel. Knock.
- Caroline. No one cares. No.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.604
- Where's Elena?
- I don't know.

14:41.760 --> 14:46.322
She probably went to the bonfire
to get more intel on our weirdo professor.

14:46.480 --> 14:49.563
Silas is here. He's with Elena,
pretending to be Stefan. Get dressed.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.209
I thought that Stefan dropped his body
in the quarry.

14:53.400 --> 14:56.643
- Join the club. Get dressed.
- Oh, my God.

14:56.840 --> 14:58.330
Oh, my God, Elena was right.

14:58.520 --> 15:01.922
All summer, she's had this pit
in her stomach about Stefan.

15:02.400 --> 15:03.640
- What?
- I don't know.

15:03.880 --> 15:07.327
She said she had this weird feeling
that something was wrong with him.

15:09.320 --> 15:13.211
Just put some clothes on and meet
me out there. We have to find her.

15:15.920 --> 15:18.048
Jeremy's still not answering.

15:18.840 --> 15:21.446
I'm gonna hold on to your phone
in case he calls back.

15:21.640 --> 15:25.725
- Why are you so worried about him?
- Damon made a mess, I want to clean it up.

15:25.920 --> 15:28.730
Did he really think
that I wasn't gonna find out?

15:29.000 --> 15:31.526
He's Damon. Are you surprised?

15:31.720 --> 15:35.691
I just figured we were at a place
where he wouldn't have to lie to me.

15:38.640 --> 15:41.166
I probably shouldn't be
talking about this with you.

15:41.320 --> 15:42.845
It's okay.

15:44.280 --> 15:48.888
I know exactly what you're thinking.

15:53.840 --> 15:58.209
I don't mean to cut this short, but someone
said they just saw Jeremy on Route 9.

15:58.400 --> 16:01.051
- Do you know where he might be going?
- Route 9?

16:01.240 --> 16:05.325
I mean, there was this old campsite
that we used to go to when we were kids.

16:05.520 --> 16:06.726
Oh.

16:08.040 --> 16:09.690
Wait, who texted you?

16:20.240 --> 16:21.480
Hello, brother.

16:23.880 --> 16:28.204
But I suppose "distant nephew"
is probably more accurate.

16:28.640 --> 16:30.404
- Mm.
- Where the hell's Elena?

16:30.560 --> 16:34.406
Ugh. There's no need
for violence, Damon.

16:35.320 --> 16:37.448
You'll find her eventually.

16:37.680 --> 16:39.762
There you go.

16:39.920 --> 16:44.289
Look, I get why you like her. I mean,
I have a soft spot for brunettes too.

16:44.520 --> 16:47.330
What I don't get is why she likes you.

16:47.560 --> 16:49.449
That's because you haven't
had sex with me.

16:50.800 --> 16:53.087
Cockiness masking fear.
How transparent.

16:53.320 --> 16:56.290
You expect me to believe
you came all this way just to talk?

16:56.440 --> 16:59.444
No. That doesn't really make
much sense, does it?

16:59.640 --> 17:04.726
But if I told you exactly what I did,
then it would ruin the fun.

17:06.280 --> 17:07.611
Enjoy the bonfire, Damon.

17:20.440 --> 17:23.569
- Why would Silas want to hurt her?
- Because he wants to hurt me.

17:23.760 --> 17:27.287
If you would have told the truth,
all of this could have been avoided.

17:27.520 --> 17:31.684
Gee, thanks, Caroline. Your hindsight
is invaluable in this situation.

17:32.480 --> 17:34.881
Watch where you're going, douche.

17:35.080 --> 17:39.085
- Have you seen Elena Gilbert?
- I have no idea who that is.

17:39.320 --> 17:42.483
And if I were her,
I'd probably run from you too.

17:43.560 --> 17:44.686
Wrong answer.

17:46.720 --> 17:48.609
Forget all this and get out of here.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.490
You have to calm down.

17:52.680 --> 17:55.251
He turned the entire town square
into a hunting party.

17:55.480 --> 17:57.050
How am I supposed to calm down...

17:57.240 --> 18:00.687
when every single person here
could be working for Silas?

18:09.240 --> 18:11.163
I got that.

18:16.600 --> 18:18.090
Whoa. I...

18:19.840 --> 18:21.604
- Boyfriend drama.
- Wow.

18:21.760 --> 18:24.650
Boyfriend drama, kicked out of class.
Today is not your day.

18:26.280 --> 18:27.725
What is his deal, anyway?

18:27.960 --> 18:29.928
- Dr. Dickfield?
- Yeah, him.

18:31.320 --> 18:34.051
Tell you what.
Help me grab some more firewood...

18:34.200 --> 18:37.363
and I will tell you
everything you need to know.

18:38.400 --> 18:40.129
Okay.

18:42.920 --> 18:45.969
I had Dr. Maxfield
for a few classes last year.

18:46.160 --> 18:50.484
He's a jerk, but he's brilliant,
so I'll give him a pass.

18:50.680 --> 18:52.808
Brilliant and creepy.

18:57.960 --> 19:02.841
There's a rumor that he's a part
of this secret society on campus.

19:05.440 --> 19:08.171
What, like, middle-aged men
at an elk lodge?

19:08.360 --> 19:09.566
I have no idea.

19:09.760 --> 19:13.560
All I know is that a few times a week,
they supposedly meet...

19:13.720 --> 19:15.563
at Whitmore House.

19:17.800 --> 19:19.609
But you didn't hear that from me.

19:21.400 --> 19:23.323
Damon? What the hell?

19:23.560 --> 19:25.927
Seriously? That's Jesse.

19:26.120 --> 19:27.326
I kind of liked him.

19:37.600 --> 19:39.762
Don't even think about it.

19:39.960 --> 19:42.884
Please.
I wouldn't even know how to use it.

19:43.080 --> 19:45.811
I've never shot a gun in my life.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.288
Didn't need to. I was much more deadly.

19:49.480 --> 19:51.130
Key word? Was.

19:53.520 --> 19:57.241
I'm gonna go get some wood for the fire.
I'll be back.

19:58.720 --> 20:02.645
I survived childbirth,
the death of my entire family...

20:02.880 --> 20:06.407
and 500 years of running
from an immortal hybrid.

20:07.200 --> 20:09.248
You can understand why
I'm a little upset...

20:09.440 --> 20:13.331
that I'm on the verge
of being defeated by a sinus infection.

20:49.920 --> 20:54.721
Not a word out of you. You can't talk.
You can't scream.

20:58.040 --> 21:01.806
Yeah, actually, I can.

21:02.360 --> 21:04.010
Jeremy, run!

21:04.720 --> 21:06.643
Let's go.

21:10.280 --> 21:12.408
Why can't I get inside your head?

21:27.240 --> 21:30.722
Now I see why.
Somebody's already in there.

21:30.920 --> 21:33.890
Why are you watching me, Traveler?

22:09.320 --> 22:11.084
Jeremy?

22:12.160 --> 22:14.766
Jeremy, hey, there you are, man. What...?

22:20.080 --> 22:22.082
What the hell?

22:23.600 --> 22:25.284
Freaky, isn't it?

22:25.440 --> 22:27.522
The feeling.

22:27.760 --> 22:29.569
The void.

22:29.960 --> 22:31.041
The emptiness.

22:31.760 --> 22:33.285
Bonnie?

22:33.440 --> 22:35.886
What's going on? Where the hell am I?

22:36.120 --> 22:39.602
The Other Side. The Gilbert ring
brought you here when you died.

22:39.800 --> 22:40.961
That's how it works.

22:41.160 --> 22:43.049
It temporarily brings your spirit here.

22:43.280 --> 22:45.647
To go back,
you have to reconnect to your body.

22:49.280 --> 22:51.282
My body's not even here.

22:51.480 --> 22:54.609
Each time you die, you wake up
farther and farther away from it.

22:54.800 --> 22:56.882
You wander the Other Side
until you find it.

22:58.280 --> 23:03.411
Wait, if I'm on the Other Side,
how can you see me?

23:05.080 --> 23:07.447
There's something you should know.

23:09.720 --> 23:11.324
All right.

23:11.720 --> 23:14.121
- Before you get mad...
- Mad can wait. Sit.

23:18.320 --> 23:20.687
Mm. Mm.

23:20.840 --> 23:24.242
Elena, wait, wait.

23:25.440 --> 23:27.602
As much as I'd like to do this right now...

24:02.840 --> 24:05.127
Silas got into your head, didn't he?

24:09.400 --> 24:10.970
What did Stefan tell you to do?

24:11.160 --> 24:13.242
Get you alone, weaken you...

24:14.480 --> 24:15.811
and then kill you.

24:37.520 --> 24:39.921
Damon, I'm so sorry, I...

24:40.480 --> 24:41.891
What the hell is happening?

24:42.120 --> 24:44.327
You were in some sort of Silas trance.

24:44.520 --> 24:46.204
But I think you snapped out of it.

24:47.360 --> 24:48.600
Silas?

24:48.840 --> 24:51.002
- But, I...
- Before you ask, no.

24:51.200 --> 24:55.000
He's not in the quarry. It's a common
misconception. You talked to him today.

24:56.800 --> 24:58.643
How is that possible?

24:58.840 --> 25:01.366
I was in a crowd full of people.

25:01.600 --> 25:04.251
I hugged him. I was talking to him
about my life, about...

25:04.480 --> 25:05.766
Me?

25:05.960 --> 25:07.928
I bet he had some choice things to say.

25:09.480 --> 25:11.881
Wait, if that was Silas,
then where's Stefan?

25:16.280 --> 25:19.602
What happened to Stefan, Damon?

25:21.520 --> 25:22.646
Where is he?

25:22.800 --> 25:25.770
Can we talk about this when you don't
have that murder-y look in your eyes?

25:25.960 --> 25:30.727
You're right. Every time I look at you,
all I wanna do is kill you.

25:33.800 --> 25:36.610
It must be Silas' mind control.

25:36.840 --> 25:40.322
He's using your anger at me like a trigger.

25:40.520 --> 25:42.045
You have to resist it.

25:42.240 --> 25:44.766
- I can't.
- Elena, you have to resist it.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.610
I'm frying!

26:03.440 --> 26:05.761
Tell me what's going on.

26:08.760 --> 26:11.650
Sorry. This is all I could find out there.

26:15.400 --> 26:17.641
Sorry my friend went aggro.

26:17.880 --> 26:19.325
He's got anger issues.

26:19.520 --> 26:21.887
- And a serious right hook.
- Heh.

26:22.080 --> 26:26.290
But hey, it got us alone together,
so that's a win.

26:39.800 --> 26:41.848
I have a boyfriend.

26:46.440 --> 26:49.489
And where is he? Other than not here.

26:49.680 --> 26:53.571
Well, he was supposed to be here.
He deferred a semester.

26:55.160 --> 26:57.970
You don't have to say anything.
I know how these things go.

26:58.160 --> 27:00.128
People go to school and they drift apart.

27:00.320 --> 27:02.561
Yeah, and sometimes they don't.

27:02.800 --> 27:04.325
Exactly. Sometimes they don't.

27:04.520 --> 27:07.603
Sometimes you change,
but what you had still means something.

27:07.800 --> 27:08.881
Yes. Yes.

27:09.080 --> 27:13.165
And sometimes, when you're thinking all those
things, your girlfriend is moving on...

27:13.400 --> 27:15.368
and sleeping with somebody
back home...

27:15.560 --> 27:18.450
and has no intention
of getting back with you.

27:18.640 --> 27:20.130
Oh, my God.

27:21.120 --> 27:23.805
Ugh. I am so sorry.

27:26.960 --> 27:29.008
It was a while ago.

27:29.920 --> 27:32.969
And honestly,
until the worst actually happened...

27:33.160 --> 27:36.050
I wouldn't listen to anybody
tell me otherwise.

27:36.240 --> 27:39.847
I could always find an excuse. So I get it.

27:50.880 --> 27:52.325
Get in the truck and drive.

27:52.960 --> 27:55.281
- Where are you going?
- I can't leave Matt.

27:56.920 --> 27:59.207
How do you think I survived 500 years?

27:59.440 --> 28:01.090
It wasn't because I was a vampire.

28:01.320 --> 28:03.926
It's because I never looked back.

28:04.160 --> 28:06.322
Don't be dumb. Survive.

28:06.520 --> 28:10.411
That's why people treat you
like an object and not like a person.

28:13.800 --> 28:15.370
It actually hasn't been so bad.

28:15.560 --> 28:20.851
I have Jeremy
and I see Grams sometimes.

28:21.040 --> 28:26.080
Last night with my dad
was the first really hard time.

28:30.880 --> 28:33.690
I'll be okay. I just have to get past
these next few days.

28:35.080 --> 28:38.562
Bonnie, you don't have to pretend
like it's okay.

28:39.320 --> 28:40.731
Your dad died.

28:40.920 --> 28:44.925
And you died.

28:47.840 --> 28:49.490
It's not okay.

28:49.680 --> 28:51.489
It has to be.

28:51.680 --> 28:53.762
Because there's nothing I can do about it.

28:57.400 --> 29:01.166
I am so sorry.

29:26.400 --> 29:27.970
Matt.

29:32.960 --> 29:35.850
Now, if my best friend died...

29:36.360 --> 29:37.964
I'd at least pretend to cry.

29:38.400 --> 29:40.687
Which leads me to believe
he's not really dead.

29:40.920 --> 29:43.241
I take it that tacky ring
somehow protects him?

29:43.760 --> 29:46.809
Too bad you can't get inside my head
to find out for sure.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.650
Hunter's perk.

29:49.000 --> 29:53.927
Heh. That's what you don't get. When I can
read your mind, I at least have use for you.

29:54.440 --> 29:57.091
Now I'm just gonna kill you.

29:57.280 --> 30:01.410
You can try, but none of your abilities work on me.
So right now, you're nothing.

30:01.600 --> 30:04.729
Slower than a vampire.
Weaker than a vampire.

30:04.920 --> 30:07.571
I, on the other hand, am a hunter.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.240
Plus, I work out.

30:41.120 --> 30:46.809
You might be stronger than me,
but you're forgetting that I am immortal.

31:09.720 --> 31:12.041
I thought you didn't know
how to use that.

31:12.240 --> 31:14.607
I figured it out.

31:18.200 --> 31:19.770
Poor Bonnie.

31:19.960 --> 31:23.328
She must have tried to call me
right after Silas stole my phone.

31:23.560 --> 31:26.086
Has anyone talked to her? Is she okay?

31:26.920 --> 31:28.285
I don't know.

31:28.480 --> 31:30.642
I've had more important things
to worry about.

31:32.080 --> 31:34.128
My best friend's dad died.

31:34.320 --> 31:36.163
That's pretty damn important.

31:36.360 --> 31:39.011
Yeah, so is protecting your brother,
finding mine...

31:39.200 --> 31:41.931
figuring out what the hell Silas wants
with Katherine.

31:42.120 --> 31:44.930
I just left.
What the hell is wrong with you?

31:45.120 --> 31:47.407
You're getting angry at me again, Elena.

31:47.600 --> 31:49.170
Remember, trigger.

31:49.800 --> 31:51.723
My brother got expelled.

31:51.920 --> 31:58.280
You've got him playing white knight to
Katherine, who's tried to kill me repeatedly.

32:00.080 --> 32:02.128
Stefan's been...

32:02.320 --> 32:06.086
He's been suffering for months...

32:06.280 --> 32:12.208
while I've been rolling around with you,
a self-proclaimed serial killer.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.968
Oh, my God.

32:17.600 --> 32:18.681
Oh, my God.

32:21.760 --> 32:26.243
Elena, that is the gas. Stop.
You don't really want to kill me, Elena.

32:26.440 --> 32:29.887
You have to realize this before
you're gonna break Silas' compulsion.

32:30.080 --> 32:34.369
I can%, okay?
All I can think about is killing you.

32:34.560 --> 32:38.201
Think about something stronger
than your desire to kill me...

32:38.400 --> 32:40.767
or you're gonna kill us both.

32:47.920 --> 32:49.843
<i>Ste'? an .</i>

32:50.040 --> 32:52.611
Stefan. Think about Stefan.

32:52.800 --> 32:56.725
Caroline told me you've been worried
about him. You had a pit in your stomach.

32:56.920 --> 33:00.766
- Describe it. Tell me about it.
- What? No, I can't.

33:00.960 --> 33:02.769
Think about him.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.241
Think about the feelings you're getting.

33:05.440 --> 33:07.602
Describe it to me.

33:09.720 --> 33:15.489
It's this... It's a chill. I can't explain
it, but it's like I can feel him.

33:17.320 --> 33:19.004
<i>He's trying to reach out to me.</i>

33:19.200 --> 33:23.125
<i>But I don't know where he is and I can't
understand what he's trying to say.</i>

33:23.320 --> 33:27.211
All I know is that he's scared.
And he's lonely.

33:27.440 --> 33:28.930
He's in a lot of pain.

33:30.360 --> 33:32.806
<i>He's in a lot of pain.</i>

33:40.320 --> 33:42.448
We have to find him.

33:43.600 --> 33:45.409
We Will.

33:47.560 --> 33:49.528
I swear.

33:55.880 --> 33:59.089
The rage. It's gone.

34:10.760 --> 34:14.685
I think we need to set some ground rules
for when boyfriends come to visit.

34:22.080 --> 34:24.560
I think someone moved my body.

34:25.320 --> 34:29.120
It's weird, but I can feel it.
It's like I'm drawn to it.

34:29.320 --> 34:31.322
There it is.

34:34.800 --> 34:38.282
So if this happens every time I die
with the Gilbert ring...

34:38.719 --> 34:42.690
the second I go back that means
I'm just gonna forget about all of this.

34:46.639 --> 34:48.051
I'll forget that you're dead.

34:49.239 --> 34:53.130
Bonnie, you and Jeremy
can't keep this a secret anymore.

34:53.360 --> 34:56.204
I'm sorry your dad died.

34:56.440 --> 34:57.726
I know it's hard...

34:57.920 --> 35:01.891
but how are you gonna deal with his death
if you can't even deal with your own?

35:05.320 --> 35:07.368
It's really good to see you, Matt.

35:23.760 --> 35:25.762
Welcome back to the land of the living.

35:30.360 --> 35:31.930
What the hell happened?

35:32.880 --> 35:37.807
- Heh. Silas killed you, tried to kill me. Then...
- I shot him.

35:38.880 --> 35:42.646
So we're even. No more whining.

35:43.360 --> 35:46.489
Let's go. Silas won't be down for long.

35:50.480 --> 35:53.450
Hey, I left the hatchet.
I'll be right back.

35:57.160 --> 35:58.650
<i>Hey-</i>

35:59.000 --> 36:00.889
You Okay?

36:02.400 --> 36:05.643
I'm not ready to be dead yet, Jeremy.

36:05.840 --> 36:06.966
I'm just not.

36:07.160 --> 36:10.164
Maybe I will be one day,
but it's not today.

36:12.040 --> 36:17.126
And I don't know what to do about my dad.
Or what to do when the sheriff calls.

36:17.360 --> 36:19.886
- Because she's...
- It's okay. We'll get through this.

36:20.080 --> 36:22.242
I can tell everybody
that you're with family.

36:22.440 --> 36:25.250
That it was too hard for you to be here.

36:25.760 --> 36:29.242
I might not be able to touch you
or hold you...

36:29.440 --> 36:31.090
but I'm here for you.

36:31.280 --> 36:32.964
No matter what you need.

37:02.560 --> 37:05.609
Did you find that girl
that you were looking for?

37:05.880 --> 37:08.121
Yes, I did.

37:08.320 --> 37:10.368
And then she shot me.

37:10.560 --> 37:15.088
So I'm little bit angry
and I'm a little bit hungry.

37:15.320 --> 37:20.360
But luckily, you can help me out
with one of those things.

37:31.560 --> 37:32.721
Fill her up.

37:53.520 --> 37:56.490
Oh, goody. Gypsies are here.

37:56.680 --> 37:57.966
Oh, I'm sorry.

37:58.160 --> 38:01.482
You call yourselves Travelers now,
right?

38:01.680 --> 38:03.170
That's much more P.C.

38:03.360 --> 38:08.002
You can call me whatever you want
when I'm gutting you.

38:09.920 --> 38:11.001
I see.

38:11.200 --> 38:14.727
You're mad that I killed your blond-haired,
blue-eyed host, right?

38:15.400 --> 38:18.882
That's what you get for taking over
somebody's body to spy on me.

38:19.080 --> 38:23.369
But congrats, you found me.
So now what? What do you want?

38:23.560 --> 38:27.087
You, back in that tomb,
sealed away for eternity.

38:28.200 --> 38:31.647
That's what the Travelers
have always wanted.

38:35.880 --> 38:39.248
Luckily for you,
I've never really considered myself one.

38:39.920 --> 38:42.491
I know you can see inside my mind.

38:44.040 --> 38:46.441
And I have my own agenda.

38:48.200 --> 38:50.009
Yes.

38:50.720 --> 38:52.643
I see that you do.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.286
I'll be back, roomie.

38:56.520 --> 38:59.126
I don't know when, but I will be back.

38:59.320 --> 39:01.561
Call me the minute
you hear from Bonnie, okay?

39:01.760 --> 39:06.084
- I've left her a hundred messages.
- I will. I promise.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.843
You're gonna find him, Elena.

39:10.640 --> 39:11.721
Yeah, I know.

39:13.440 --> 39:16.046
- Bye.
- Bye.

39:17.200 --> 39:20.443
I didn't think Elena Gilbert
would give up so easily.

39:21.360 --> 39:25.081
Sorry about being a hard ass earlier.
It's kind of my thing.

39:25.600 --> 39:28.046
You're Grayson Gilbert's daughter,
aren't you?

39:28.240 --> 39:30.208
- You knew my dad?
- Knew of him.

39:30.400 --> 39:32.687
He's a legend around here. Brilliant.

39:32.880 --> 39:34.484
I've studied all his research.

39:34.720 --> 39:36.927
I can only hope
to do the kind of work he did.

39:37.120 --> 39:40.329
So does that mean
that he forged death certificates too?

39:42.000 --> 39:45.004
And here I thought you were
just passionate about microbiology.

39:45.840 --> 39:49.128
I have office hours tomorrow.
Come by. We can chat.

39:49.480 --> 39:53.280
Um, yeah, I would, but I've got other
important things on my plate right now.

39:55.360 --> 39:57.806
Let me know when that plate clears.

40:01.120 --> 40:03.964
Well, I guess that's how
a hero would do it.

40:04.160 --> 40:05.685
Honesty.

40:05.920 --> 40:07.445
Who'd have thunk it?

40:10.400 --> 40:12.050
Aren't you the least bit curious...

40:12.240 --> 40:15.210
<i>about the whole Nancy Drew
and the Creepster Professor thing?</i>

40:15.400 --> 40:16.811
Caroline'll take over.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.241
I can't stay knowing
that Stefan's out there.

40:19.440 --> 40:20.646
Yeah, well...

40:22.840 --> 40:26.447
- That's Stefan's daylight ring.
- I snagged it from Silas yesterday.

40:26.640 --> 40:29.689
And for the record,
I'm secure enough in our relationship...

40:29.880 --> 40:33.930
that you having psychic dreams about
your ex-boyfriend does not bother me.

40:36.120 --> 40:37.201
But it still sucks.

40:40.080 --> 40:41.206
I love you.

40:42.160 --> 40:48.645
We're gonna save Stefan
and I'm still going to love you. Okay?

41:09.200 --> 41:10.770
Yeah?

41:10.920 --> 41:12.570
<i>We found something.</i>

41:13.520 --> 41:17.161
We didn't find anything in the quarry,
a deputy found this a few miles away.

41:17.360 --> 41:19.249
He didn't open it.

41:19.440 --> 41:25.004
If Stefan's been in there for three months,
chances are he's hungry.

41:37.520 --> 41:39.329
Oh, my God.

41:39.520 --> 41:42.967
- It's not Stefan.
- But you're right. He was hungry.

41:46.720 --> 41:48.802
Bet he still is.
