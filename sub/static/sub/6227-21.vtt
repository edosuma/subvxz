WEBVTT

00:00.751 --> 00:02.173
Previously on Grimm...

00:02.252 --> 00:04.254
Yeah, we got you
on breaking and entering,

00:04.338 --> 00:06.466
assaulting an officer,
drugs in the car.

00:06.548 --> 00:07.800
Why'd you pick
that house?

00:07.883 --> 00:09.055
What were you after?

00:09.134 --> 00:10.181
We've got a problem.

00:10.344 --> 00:12.597
Burkhardt is here. He's
taking me to a safe house.

00:12.679 --> 00:14.647
What do you want me to do?
Cooperate.

00:14.765 --> 00:16.017
So, you don't
want to talk.

00:16.099 --> 00:18.227
Then I guess you won't be
needing your mouth.

00:21.772 --> 00:22.819
What is it?

00:22.898 --> 00:24.525
I think it saved
Monroe's life.

00:24.608 --> 00:25.700
He was bitten on his arm.

00:25.776 --> 00:28.199
The wound healed.
It completely disappeared.

00:28.278 --> 00:30.076
It's not just a stick.

00:30.155 --> 00:31.828
Damn! That's kind of big.

00:32.991 --> 00:34.163
Thank you, everyone!

00:34.243 --> 00:35.711
I have a lot of people
I need to thank tonight,

00:35.786 --> 00:37.663
but I would like to begin
with the love of my life

00:37.746 --> 00:39.748
and the mother
of my children, Ada/ind.

00:39.831 --> 00:41.003
Come here, you.

00:45.963 --> 00:47.385
You're dead.

00:58.100 --> 01:00.649
In a remarkable
campaign that was put together

01:00.727 --> 01:03.196
after the assassination
of the party candidate,

01:03.272 --> 01:05.366
Police Captain,
Sean Renard, has won

01:05.440 --> 01:07.989
a decisive victory
in the race for Mayor.

01:08.151 --> 01:09.994
How could Adalind
do this to Nick?

01:10.070 --> 01:11.287
Unbelievable.

01:11.363 --> 01:13.331
There's not even
a word to describe this.

01:13.448 --> 01:15.416
Sean Renard to take
Andrew Dixon's place...

01:15.492 --> 01:18.041
I can't believe
this is even happening.

01:18.203 --> 01:21.753
I can't imagine what must be going
on in Nick's head right now.

01:21.832 --> 01:23.209
I can.

01:25.168 --> 01:27.421
Renard wanted me
to join Black Claw.

01:27.671 --> 01:28.923
I'm sure he did.

01:29.006 --> 01:30.929
Having you on their side
would be very advantageous.

01:31.008 --> 01:32.100
Her, too.

01:32.175 --> 01:33.347
Why do they want us?

01:33.427 --> 01:35.600
To control Wesen that won't
agree with their agenda.

01:35.679 --> 01:37.181
Grimms have always
been very good at that.

01:37.306 --> 01:40.435
Black Claw will use the system at
first, getting elected into office.

01:40.517 --> 01:42.861
Once they're there, they're
gonna start making changes.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.438
Lower level positions
at first.

01:44.521 --> 01:46.865
Power grid, fire department,
then the police.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.784
They'll work their way up, all
the way to council members,

01:49.860 --> 01:52.989
commissioners, assistant district
attorneys, heads of department.

01:53.071 --> 01:54.869
Zuri wasn't trying
to recruit me.

01:55.532 --> 01:56.875
No, she was just
trying to figure out

01:56.950 --> 01:58.270
what kind of information
you have.

01:58.577 --> 02:01.626
They're gonna try and take down
everyone around the Grimm.

02:01.705 --> 02:03.423
This won't be a war
you can fight alone.

02:03.498 --> 02:04.875
And friends
make you vulnerable.

02:06.209 --> 02:07.961
I've gotten as much
out of her as I could.

02:08.044 --> 02:09.170
Is she, uh...

02:09.253 --> 02:10.550
She's not dead.

02:11.381 --> 02:13.383
Good, I think.

02:13.884 --> 02:14.885
What'd you get?

02:14.968 --> 02:17.187
She was recruited by Black Claw
five and a half months ago,

02:17.262 --> 02:18.684
specifically to go
after Hank.

02:18.764 --> 02:21.483
She suggested that it wasn't a
decision she was happy with,

02:21.558 --> 02:23.310
but she said she was sorry.

02:23.393 --> 02:25.646
But I think she was just trying
to play on my sympathies.

02:25.729 --> 02:27.151
Bet that didn't
go down so well.

02:27.230 --> 02:28.322
What about contacts?

02:28.398 --> 02:30.651
She resisted, but I convinced
her to dig deeper.

02:30.859 --> 02:32.236
Sounds uncomfortable.

02:32.319 --> 02:33.536
It was.

02:33.695 --> 02:35.663
She gave up a name.
Bonaparte.

02:35.739 --> 02:37.616
Conrad Bonaparte?
He's here?

02:37.699 --> 02:38.951
You know him?

02:39.242 --> 02:42.542
He's one of
the founders of Black Claw.

02:42.829 --> 02:45.628
If he's here,
he's running the operation.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.636
So, what are you
gonna do with Zuri?

02:49.711 --> 02:52.214
She's being taken
to a secure site.

02:55.509 --> 02:56.886
Griffin.

02:57.386 --> 02:58.638
It's dispatch.

02:59.221 --> 03:01.269
3045 Hudson Street?

03:02.766 --> 03:04.234
Yeah, thanks.

03:04.518 --> 03:05.838
Something wrong
with that address?

03:05.894 --> 03:07.316
Yeah, it's mine.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.690
We'll check in
with you later.

03:10.941 --> 03:13.035
Can you just...
Can you turn the TV off?

03:13.110 --> 03:15.158
It's like, I can't even
listen to that right now.

03:19.366 --> 03:22.085
And that damn truck
is still out there!

03:22.452 --> 03:25.046
And how long is
this supposed to go on?

03:25.122 --> 03:26.874
I think this is
just starting.

03:26.957 --> 03:28.425
Well, I'm sick of it.

03:28.500 --> 03:29.547
What are you doing?

03:29.626 --> 03:31.594
I'm gonna tell them
to get off our damn street!

03:31.712 --> 03:34.010
Monroe! No! We are not
living like this!

03:34.089 --> 03:35.306
Monroe!

03:36.174 --> 03:37.391
Monroe!

03:37.801 --> 03:39.644
Monroe, don't do this!

03:39.803 --> 03:40.975
They could have guns!

03:41.054 --> 03:42.397
No, I just wanna find out
who they voted for!

03:42.472 --> 03:44.395
Hey, guys. How are you doing?
Are you lost or something?

03:44.474 --> 03:46.818
I mean, you've been sitting
out here for a long time!

03:46.893 --> 03:48.019
Will you stop?

03:48.103 --> 03:49.446
I mean, you must be
getting kinda tired

03:49.521 --> 03:50.943
of looking at our house
by now,

03:51.022 --> 03:52.069
because we're sure
as hell getting tired

03:52.149 --> 03:55.403
of looking at you
looking at our house!

03:55.819 --> 03:57.821
What do you think
you're doing?

03:58.780 --> 04:01.033
What I should have done
a long time ago!

04:01.116 --> 04:02.493
I'm sorry.
This is our home.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.954
We are letting those
idiots rule our lives!

04:05.036 --> 04:06.396
I know, but getting
yourself killed

04:06.413 --> 04:07.756
is not gonna make
our lives any better!

04:07.831 --> 04:09.083
Thank you very much!

04:12.836 --> 04:15.089
I'm sorry.
But this is just...

04:15.422 --> 04:17.516
It's getting out of hand!

04:19.843 --> 04:21.060
Are you okay?

04:21.261 --> 04:22.763
Just a little stressed.

04:22.846 --> 04:25.816
I know. I'm sorry,
I'm sure I'm not helping.

04:30.520 --> 04:31.942
Yeah, you feel
a little warm.

04:32.022 --> 04:33.148
That's because I'm angry.

04:34.483 --> 04:35.826
Here's the license plate
to the truck.

04:35.901 --> 04:39.201
I thought we should call
Trubel and give it to her.

04:39.488 --> 04:42.241
At least one of us
wasn't being stupid.

04:48.997 --> 04:50.795
Do you need any help
with the kids?

04:50.874 --> 04:52.376
We can manage, thanks.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.177
Let's get you to bed.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.525
Congratulations
on this victory.

05:09.476 --> 05:11.399
I obviously wouldn't
be here without you.

05:11.478 --> 05:15.028
No, but you won
the election legitimately.

05:15.357 --> 05:17.780
I won,
let's just leave it at that.

05:17.984 --> 05:21.363
It's politics, nothing
is ever what it seems.

05:21.571 --> 05:23.619
But this is just
the first step.

05:23.698 --> 05:26.201
Now, we need your new life
with Adalind to work,

05:26.284 --> 05:27.752
if we're going
to move forward.

05:28.411 --> 05:29.879
That's not entirely
up to me.

05:30.038 --> 05:31.836
Would you mind
if I talked to her?

05:33.416 --> 05:34.918
Would it matter if I did?

05:37.671 --> 05:39.014
Good night.

05:39.422 --> 05:40.765
Good night.

05:43.593 --> 05:44.810
Good night, honey.

05:44.928 --> 05:46.180
You were
very good tonight.

05:46.263 --> 05:47.515
We love you.

05:48.723 --> 05:50.942
Good night, Mommy.
Good night, Daddy.

06:18.128 --> 06:20.802
So, Mr. Mayor,
how does it feel?

06:21.256 --> 06:22.508
Sudden.

06:23.049 --> 06:24.642
And somehow, well deserved.

06:25.635 --> 06:28.559
Nothing like standing on a dead
guy's shoulders to get there.

06:40.150 --> 06:41.197
What?

06:42.527 --> 06:43.995
I'm not sure,

06:45.322 --> 06:46.414
I just...

06:52.913 --> 06:53.914
Mmm.

07:52.514 --> 07:54.687
No!

07:59.938 --> 08:02.191
What the hell's
the matter with you?

08:02.273 --> 08:03.570
Don't you see
what's going on?

08:03.650 --> 08:04.697
You know,
I thought I did!

08:04.776 --> 08:06.619
You moron!
It's our daughter!

08:06.695 --> 08:08.242
She's the one
doing this, not us!

08:08.321 --> 08:09.641
What are you
talking about? Diana?

08:09.698 --> 08:11.575
Oh, God! Do you really think that
I just all of a sudden decided

08:11.658 --> 08:13.205
you were the hottest guy
on Earth

08:13.284 --> 08:14.456
and couldn't wait to
take my clothes off

08:14.536 --> 08:15.753
and hop into bed with you?

08:15.829 --> 08:17.706
Well, lam the new Mayor.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.254
I didn't vote for you.

08:20.417 --> 08:22.419
You may not want to
be here, but you are.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.012
You better get used to it.

08:24.087 --> 08:26.931
Because this is a position
you can't quit.

08:53.158 --> 08:54.455
What the hell?

08:56.119 --> 08:57.291
Are there detectives here?

08:57.370 --> 08:58.462
Yes, sir, inside,

08:58.538 --> 08:59.710
but they're in the middle
of the investigation.

08:59.789 --> 09:01.086
No, this is my house.

09:01.166 --> 09:03.326
Oh, they're definitely gonna
want to talk to you, then.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.549
Go ahead.

09:17.724 --> 09:19.476
I've never seen
these guys before.

09:24.814 --> 09:26.066
I have.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.078
Sorry, I'm in a hurry.

09:31.738 --> 09:32.830
What?

09:32.906 --> 09:33.998
These guys are Black Claw.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.166
How do you know that?

09:35.241 --> 09:36.584
They were following me.

09:36.659 --> 09:37.956
When?
Last night.

09:38.119 --> 09:39.291
You did this?

09:39.370 --> 09:40.872
Well, I didn't
have a choice.

09:40.955 --> 09:42.753
I was on my way to HW.

09:42.832 --> 09:44.800
Somebody is
setting you up.

09:47.003 --> 09:48.050
Who let you in?

09:48.171 --> 09:50.515
This is my house.
I'm Detective Griffin.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.262
Detective Burkhardt.

09:52.509 --> 09:53.476
We got a call
from dispatch.

09:53.551 --> 09:54.598
They thought
it was a mistake.

09:54.677 --> 09:56.679
Boyd Baribeau,
North Precinct.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.310
This is Kate Masters.

09:58.389 --> 09:59.436
Wanna tell us
what two dead guys

09:59.516 --> 10:00.563
are doing in your
living room?

10:00.642 --> 10:01.985
I have no idea.

10:02.060 --> 10:03.061
Uh-uh.

10:03.520 --> 10:04.612
No, he couldn't have
done this.

10:04.687 --> 10:05.904
He's been with me
most of the night.

10:05.980 --> 10:07.460
Most of the night
might not be enough.

10:07.524 --> 10:08.946
You sound like you know
what happened here.

10:09.025 --> 10:11.073
If these two guys
were killed here,

10:11.152 --> 10:13.120
there would be blood
all over the floor.

10:13.196 --> 10:14.288
We have a witness.

10:14.364 --> 10:15.957
Who?
Neighbor.

10:16.074 --> 10:17.075
Called 911.

10:17.158 --> 10:19.035
Reported a gunshot and
yelling earlier tonight.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.121
And described
an African-American male,

10:21.204 --> 10:22.877
forties,
about six foot tall.

10:22.956 --> 10:25.960
Positively identified as
Police Detective Hank Griffin,

10:26.042 --> 10:28.170
running out of the house
at about 10:00 this evening.

10:28.253 --> 10:29.846
No, they're wrong.
What neighbor told you that?

10:29.921 --> 10:31.719
A Mrs. Miller.
Lives across the street.

10:32.006 --> 10:33.258
You know
how this works.

10:33.341 --> 10:34.684
We're gonna have to take
you in for questioning.

10:34.759 --> 10:35.976
We'll clear this thing up.

10:36.052 --> 10:38.601
So, anything you say can
and will be used against you.

10:39.222 --> 10:41.725
We're gonna need
your badge and gun.

10:51.401 --> 10:52.618
Let's go.

10:56.531 --> 10:57.953
I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave.

10:58.032 --> 10:59.659
These bodies
were dumped here.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.119
I don't wanna
have to explain

11:01.202 --> 11:04.376
how a police detective
contaminated a crime scene.

11:04.455 --> 11:05.752
Let's go.

11:26.811 --> 11:30.111
Wu. Sorry to wake you up,
but we've got a problem.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.408
Meet me at the precinct.

11:32.942 --> 11:34.569
I'll tell you
when I get there.

11:34.652 --> 11:35.778
Be there in 15.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.534
Conrad Bonaparte.

11:40.617 --> 11:41.869
Very little
we know about him.

11:41.951 --> 11:43.624
And what we do know
is not very helpful.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.580
He's in his 40s,
maybe 50s.

11:45.663 --> 11:49.258
He lives in Prague, Paris,
Macau, take your pick.

11:49.334 --> 11:51.007
And he's either
from Morocco, Egypt,

11:51.085 --> 11:52.678
Budapest or Iran.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.552
So we know
nothing of value.

11:54.631 --> 11:56.474
We do know
he's a very bad man.

11:56.549 --> 11:57.926
I've got something
you should see.

11:58.009 --> 11:59.761
This is the laptop
Nick brought in.

11:59.886 --> 12:01.888
Belongs to Tony Talamonti,

12:01.971 --> 12:03.518
the guy who stole
Hank's phone.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.817
Here, we know Black Claw
is watching everybody,

12:05.975 --> 12:08.694
but now they're making sure
everybody has them.

12:08.770 --> 12:10.818
Every single one of these photos
was shared over the Internet.

12:10.939 --> 12:12.699
This is more than
just surveillance.

12:15.151 --> 12:16.949
It's Monroe.
Take it.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.196
Monroe?
I'm with Eve and Meisner.

12:18.279 --> 12:19.326
You're on speaker.

12:19.405 --> 12:20.657
Yeah, that's great,

12:20.740 --> 12:21.912
I didn't even know
if I'd get you.

12:21.991 --> 12:23.083
You okay?

12:23.159 --> 12:24.160
Uh, yeah.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.372
No, I just, I had
a little confrontation

12:26.454 --> 12:27.421
with the, um,
Black Claw guys

12:27.497 --> 12:28.840
stationed outside my house.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.126
You need clean-up?
No, no.

12:32.001 --> 12:34.174
I didn't go that far,
not that I didn't want to,

12:34.254 --> 12:36.973
but, uh, look, Rosalee got
their license plate.

12:37.048 --> 12:38.049
Give it to us.

12:38.132 --> 12:41.352
Okay, it's Oregon plate,
483 WHF.

12:41.511 --> 12:42.558
Are they still out there?

12:42.637 --> 12:44.139
No. No.
They took off when I,

12:44.222 --> 12:45.822
you know, went out
to have a little chat.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.101
I just thought
you should have this.

12:48.184 --> 12:49.276
Plus, next time I see them,

12:49.352 --> 12:51.400
I'd like to address them
by their first names.

12:51.521 --> 12:53.194
We'll let you know
what we find out.

12:53.314 --> 12:54.691
Sounds good.

12:54.774 --> 12:55.900
It's in our system.

12:55.984 --> 12:58.362
Truck is registered
to 521 Skyline Drive.

12:58.444 --> 12:59.696
It's the same address
we got off

12:59.779 --> 13:01.579
the Black Claw operatives
we killed in Nevada.

13:03.074 --> 13:04.997
Map it.

13:06.869 --> 13:09.873
Find out everything about it
and what's around it.

13:10.498 --> 13:12.216
Then, we go see 'em.

13:20.758 --> 13:22.260
Why aren't you asleep?

13:23.011 --> 13:24.308
I don't know.

13:38.359 --> 13:41.533
Maybe this is
why you're not asleep.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.575
How come you and Daddy
don't like each other?

13:47.076 --> 13:49.795
We haven't spent
a lot of time together.

13:50.079 --> 13:52.548
And sometimes
that makes people

13:52.623 --> 13:53.920
not know
each other very well.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.177
But you can't
push people together,

13:56.252 --> 13:58.300
especially not
a mommy and daddy.

13:58.379 --> 13:59.926
You understand?

14:00.757 --> 14:02.555
I don't like Rachel.

14:03.009 --> 14:04.261
Why not?

14:04.344 --> 14:06.221
Because she likes Daddy.

14:06.804 --> 14:09.182
That's not something
you have to worry about.

14:09.265 --> 14:11.359
Now, it's been a long day

14:11.434 --> 14:13.107
and you need to get
some sleep, okay?

14:13.519 --> 14:15.396
Will you stay with me?

14:15.938 --> 14:17.110
Sure.

14:26.783 --> 14:28.456
Just so
you don't feel guilty,

14:28.534 --> 14:29.877
I wasn't sleeping anyway.

14:29.952 --> 14:31.044
What's the problem?

14:31.120 --> 14:33.589
Somebody dumped two bodies
at Hank's house.

14:33.664 --> 14:34.790
What?

14:35.041 --> 14:36.088
Who killed them?

14:36.167 --> 14:38.340
I did. Why is not
important right now,

14:38.419 --> 14:40.592
but somebody wants Hank
to take the fall for it.

14:40.671 --> 14:43.345
And there's a witness,
Hank's neighbor, Mrs. Miller.

14:43.424 --> 14:44.425
This is her.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.303
There's a witness
for something he didn't do,

14:46.386 --> 14:47.638
that you did?

14:47.720 --> 14:49.768
No record,
retired school teacher,

14:49.847 --> 14:51.520
been in the same house
for 30 years.

14:51.599 --> 14:53.567
Okay, that makes her
sound kind of reliable.

14:53.643 --> 14:55.566
Either she's being forced
to lie by Black Claw,

14:55.645 --> 14:57.363
or she is Black Claw.

14:57.438 --> 14:59.907
Either way, we're gonna
have to talk to her.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.162
Get out.

15:16.374 --> 15:17.500
Okay.

15:20.086 --> 15:21.338
This isn't right.

15:21.421 --> 15:22.843
You need to answer
some questions.

15:25.007 --> 15:26.930
So, we're not doing this
by the book.

15:27.009 --> 15:28.352
Not exactly.

15:28.511 --> 15:30.311
But I'm sure you're pretty
familiar with that.

15:32.014 --> 15:33.574
Look, I guess if you
were gonna shoot...

15:57.373 --> 16:00.126
We need him alive.
Not for much longer.

16:05.882 --> 16:06.974
We've got him.

16:27.069 --> 16:29.037
It's her car.
She should be home.

16:29.113 --> 16:30.660
How do you wanna
handle this?

16:30.740 --> 16:32.993
If she's Black Claw, she's
gonna know why we're here.

16:33.075 --> 16:34.201
Yeah. But if she's not
Black Claw,

16:34.285 --> 16:35.787
she may be too scared
to talk to us.

16:35.912 --> 16:38.085
Well, no matter what she is,
she's not innocent.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.290
She lied.

16:39.373 --> 16:40.420
You take the back.

16:53.054 --> 16:54.772
Nick. Back door's open.

17:24.794 --> 17:26.090
House is clear.

17:26.170 --> 17:27.547
No Mrs. Miller.

17:27.630 --> 17:30.030
I think we should go with the
"she was forced to lie" theory.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.471
Check the 911 call.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.804
See what phone it was
made from and what time.

17:34.136 --> 17:36.355
I'm gonna talk to the detectives
who took her statement.

17:36.430 --> 17:38.398
If their witness is gone,
they can't hold Hank.

17:38.474 --> 17:39.726
Yep.

17:41.727 --> 17:44.230
I'm glad you came over.
Mmm.

17:44.647 --> 17:45.864
So am I.

17:47.650 --> 17:49.277
But you can't
stay the night.

17:49.360 --> 17:50.577
I know.

17:51.529 --> 17:53.827
I have an image
to protect now.

17:58.703 --> 18:00.171
I'm gonna miss this.

18:00.621 --> 18:02.498
We don't have to stop.

18:05.668 --> 18:07.386
I'm afraid we do.

18:08.421 --> 18:09.798
Adalind needs to understand

18:09.880 --> 18:12.850
how important family values
are to the Cause.

18:13.134 --> 18:15.057
Our relationship
isn't helping.

18:16.345 --> 18:18.097
Well, it's helping me.

18:19.849 --> 18:21.226
Get out.

18:38.743 --> 18:40.586
Hey. Detective Burkhardt.

18:40.661 --> 18:43.835
I'm looking for Detectives
Masters and Baribeau.

18:43.914 --> 18:45.006
Yeah?

18:45.124 --> 18:46.296
You got a problem?

18:46.375 --> 18:47.968
Yeah, I got a problem.

18:48.044 --> 18:49.466
Hey, Lieutenant.
Yeah.

18:49.545 --> 18:53.095
Got a Detective Burkhardt over
here, who's got a problem.

18:53.174 --> 18:57.099
Detective Burkhardt,
what is your problem?

18:57.720 --> 18:59.563
My problem is
a case being handled

18:59.639 --> 19:02.062
by Detectives
Masters and Baribeau.

19:02.266 --> 19:04.314
They brought in my partner,
Detective Griffin.

19:04.393 --> 19:05.895
Uh, that's too bad.

19:06.562 --> 19:08.235
But, I don't think
your partner's here.

19:08.564 --> 19:12.159
You're right, Lieutenant,
no Detective Griffin here.

19:12.234 --> 19:15.204
I feel real sorry for you,
Detective Burkhardt.

19:15.613 --> 19:17.661
You must be very frustrated.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.333
What the hell's
going on here?

19:21.369 --> 19:23.497
You're in
the wrong place, Grimm.

19:23.579 --> 19:25.456
No one's gonna
help you here.

19:25.539 --> 19:26.916
Where's my partner?

19:26.999 --> 19:28.039
Got a problem, Lieutenant?

19:28.084 --> 19:29.084
No.

19:29.126 --> 19:30.924
I got a Grimm
asking for help.

19:33.756 --> 19:35.303
Maybe you haven't heard,

19:35.383 --> 19:36.885
we got ourselves
a new Mayor.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.598
Things are changing
around here.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.021
And they already have.

19:43.224 --> 19:46.273
Go ahead,
let's see what you got.

19:50.940 --> 19:52.112
Maybe next time.

20:01.951 --> 20:03.669
How much longer
do we have to wait?

20:03.744 --> 20:05.792
If I knew, I'd tell you.

20:05.996 --> 20:07.168
Why isn't he here?

20:07.373 --> 20:09.375
If I knew, I'd tell you.

20:10.501 --> 20:11.753
Call him!

20:11.836 --> 20:13.258
I'm not calling him.

20:13.337 --> 20:15.214
If you wanna call him,
go ahead.

20:15.297 --> 20:16.469
I don't like waiting.

20:16.549 --> 20:17.675
Neither do I.

20:17.758 --> 20:20.181
We should just kill him and
get the hell out of here!

20:20.553 --> 20:22.681
Your partner killed
two of our people.

20:22.763 --> 20:25.061
You don't think there's consequences
for something like that?

20:25.141 --> 20:28.236
Yeah, I believe in
consequences, for everybody.

20:29.729 --> 20:33.108
Yeah, and you're
gonna be first.

20:42.491 --> 20:44.209
Something doesn't
feel right.

20:44.285 --> 20:45.377
Then call him.

20:54.378 --> 20:56.506
I'm telling you,
something's not right here.

21:01.469 --> 21:03.096
You wanted to see me?

21:03.179 --> 21:04.522
Yes, I did.

21:04.972 --> 21:06.724
Please, have a seat.

21:14.356 --> 21:17.906
Adalind, I know you're
not in love with Sean.

21:18.194 --> 21:19.446
I'm doing the best I can.

21:19.528 --> 21:20.905
I don't believe you are.

21:20.988 --> 21:22.615
Well, you're not a woman.

21:23.199 --> 21:24.701
I'm not asking you
to be in love.

21:24.784 --> 21:26.411
Then what
are you asking me?

21:26.577 --> 21:29.080
I want you to think
about the children,

21:29.163 --> 21:30.881
about how important
their future is.

21:30.956 --> 21:32.333
If I wasn't thinking about

21:32.416 --> 21:34.885
what's best for my children,
I wouldn't be here.

21:35.044 --> 21:36.261
I know that.

21:36.796 --> 21:39.549
Sean just isn't my type.

21:40.132 --> 21:42.806
And unfortunately
that's not gonna change.

21:45.888 --> 21:47.561
Adalind,

21:49.600 --> 21:52.149
you need to know
something about me.

21:52.436 --> 21:54.109
I'm not like Sean.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.065
There's more to me than that.

22:07.660 --> 22:10.789
We need to understand
each other on a deeper level.

22:17.878 --> 22:20.848
And if you're going to
be stubborn about it...

22:26.011 --> 22:28.105
Then you should
look like what you are.

22:41.777 --> 22:44.030
Now, is this really
how you want

22:44.113 --> 22:46.161
your children
to see you? Hmm?

23:01.714 --> 23:02.840
I'm sorry.

23:03.132 --> 23:04.475
That hurt.

23:05.134 --> 23:06.306
A lot!

23:06.468 --> 23:08.470
Sometimes a point
has to be made.

23:08.804 --> 23:12.479
But we are not asking you
to do this for nothing.

23:14.977 --> 23:16.024
What's that?

23:17.229 --> 23:18.526
A wedding ring.

23:19.148 --> 23:22.368
You are a princess and
Sean will be your prince.

23:22.735 --> 23:24.737
People love a fairy tale.

23:25.571 --> 23:28.450
It's beautiful.

23:29.116 --> 23:31.039
Oh, one more thing.

23:33.329 --> 23:35.832
Do not take this ring off,

23:36.123 --> 23:39.093
because it would be
extremely painful

23:39.168 --> 23:40.215
for your children.

23:44.256 --> 23:47.510
It's very nice, thank you.

23:48.302 --> 23:49.349
Hmm.

23:50.471 --> 23:51.939
You're most welcome.

23:57.686 --> 23:59.984
Did you check the 911 call? Yep.

24:00.064 --> 24:01.441
It took a while
because I had to check

24:01.523 --> 24:02.775
every call for
a 10-hour period

24:02.858 --> 24:05.031
only to find out
no call was made.

24:05.110 --> 24:06.908
No 911 call came in
from Mrs. Miller?

24:06.987 --> 24:08.204
Or from anyone else.

24:08.280 --> 24:11.409
There were no crimes reported
on Hank's street at all.

24:11.492 --> 24:12.493
What'd you get?

24:13.786 --> 24:15.959
The detectives who took
Hank are Black Claw.

24:16.956 --> 24:18.082
How'd you find that out?

24:18.165 --> 24:19.508
I just got back
from the precinct.

24:19.583 --> 24:21.301
Almost every cop
I saw was Wesen.

24:21.377 --> 24:23.675
What? And they all
knew I was a Grimm.

24:23.754 --> 24:25.301
And they're holding
Hank there?

24:25.381 --> 24:27.804
They said he's not there.
I don't know where he is.

24:27.883 --> 24:31.353
Even if he is, I can't get
to him, at least not alone.

24:31.971 --> 24:33.223
Check to see
if they booked him,

24:33.305 --> 24:35.273
and if they did
he'll be in the system.

24:38.227 --> 24:39.979
Nope, nothing.

24:40.062 --> 24:41.405
They haven't
filed any paperwork,

24:41.480 --> 24:42.732
so whatever they're up to,

24:42.815 --> 24:44.112
it's not by the book.

24:44.191 --> 24:46.114
These guys
are Black Claw,

24:46.193 --> 24:47.866
the charge is bogus
and they know it.

24:47.945 --> 24:50.243
I doubt they even
took him in.

24:50.447 --> 24:51.915
Then how are
we gonna find him?

24:52.741 --> 24:55.961
We still have the guy who
Hank brought in for the B&E?

24:56.245 --> 24:58.043
Tony Talamonti, yeah,
he's still in holding.

24:58.122 --> 25:00.124
He's Black Claw, he's got
to be connected to this.

25:00.207 --> 25:01.504
He's got to know something.

25:01.583 --> 25:03.210
Yeah, but he already knows
I'm a Grimm.

25:03.293 --> 25:05.091
So you can’t just
scare it out of him.

25:05.754 --> 25:06.846
No.

25:07.673 --> 25:11.394
We need someone who he knows
has a real reason to kill him.

25:12.928 --> 25:14.020
Nick.

25:14.138 --> 25:15.264
You have any customers?

25:15.389 --> 25:16.732
Not at the moment.
What's up?

25:20.894 --> 25:22.191
Black Claw has Hank.

25:22.271 --> 25:23.488
What?
No.

25:23.564 --> 25:24.907
We're trying to figure out
where they have him.

25:24.982 --> 25:26.502
We've got a guy
who I think might know.

25:26.567 --> 25:27.944
- Who?
- Tony.

25:28.027 --> 25:29.620
Tony?
Tony?

25:29.778 --> 25:31.280
We still
have him in custody.

25:31.363 --> 25:33.616
He stole Hank's cell phone so we
know he was assigned to Hank.

25:33.699 --> 25:35.076
I'll get it out of him.

25:35.159 --> 25:36.786
But you can't kill him.

25:36.952 --> 25:38.579
He just has to
believe you will.

25:38.954 --> 25:40.627
I don't think that's
gonna be a problem.

25:41.123 --> 25:42.545
I want you to go in first.

25:42.624 --> 25:45.304
I want you to identify him as the
guy who attacked you in this shop.

25:45.335 --> 25:47.053
No. Why?
I can do that.

25:47.129 --> 25:49.473
You're her husband,
he attacked your wife.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.300
I want him to know
this is personal.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.135
Oh, it's personal.

25:53.677 --> 25:54.803
When do you wanna do it?

25:54.887 --> 25:55.979
Now.

26:07.232 --> 26:09.155
I've got nothing to say.
Yeah, we know.

26:10.319 --> 26:12.447
So, what're we gonna do,
stare at each other?

26:12.529 --> 26:13.872
Something like that.

26:15.991 --> 26:18.335
Two detectives
took my partner.

26:20.162 --> 26:22.039
You mean,
the guy that arrested me.

26:22.206 --> 26:25.426
Gee, I'm really sorry
to hear that.

26:25.501 --> 26:26.627
Where did they take him?

26:27.211 --> 26:29.088
Mmm. Don't know.

26:29.171 --> 26:30.331
How'd you hurt
your hand, Tony?

26:30.339 --> 26:31.386
Tripped.

26:31.507 --> 26:32.679
Over a Hexenbiest?

26:34.885 --> 26:37.513
Pretty, blonde.
About this tall.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.189
Bet you were feeling
pretty tough at the time.

26:39.306 --> 26:41.104
Where did
they take Hank, Tony?

26:41.183 --> 26:44.403
- Let me think. Uh...
-  Barbados.

26:51.527 --> 26:53.074
Is this the guy
who hit you?

26:53.153 --> 26:54.370
Yeah. That's him.

26:54.446 --> 26:56.039
Well, look what
happened to me!

26:56.490 --> 26:58.163
If you know where
Hank is, tell them.

26:59.952 --> 27:02.296
You're still
so pretty, Rosie,

27:02.371 --> 27:04.590
especially when
you're upset.

27:06.917 --> 27:08.669
It's all right.
It's okay. It's all right.

27:10.796 --> 27:15.723
So, Tony, I guess
we'll be adding an assault.

27:16.135 --> 27:18.354
Yeah, sure,
just add it to my list.

27:19.221 --> 27:21.394
It's not your assault.

27:22.891 --> 27:25.861
I'm not sure if you've met
Rosalee's husband.

27:26.728 --> 27:28.981
Monroe, Tony.

27:29.314 --> 27:32.158
Tony, Monroe.

27:33.235 --> 27:35.329
Hey, hey!
What are you doing?

27:35.404 --> 27:36.530
Tony.

27:37.781 --> 27:39.783
How nice to finally
meet you.

27:43.704 --> 27:45.081
No, no.

27:45.164 --> 27:46.541
No, no, no, no!

27:57.342 --> 27:59.265
How long do we give him?

28:02.764 --> 28:04.391
About that long.

28:07.895 --> 28:10.023
521 Skyline Drive.

28:10.480 --> 28:12.778
Thanks.
Oh, no. Thank you.

28:19.698 --> 28:20.950
What do we do
with the address?

28:21.033 --> 28:23.786
If this is Black Claw,
I can't do this alone.

28:23.911 --> 28:25.003
I'm gonna take it to HW.

28:25.078 --> 28:26.170
- Way to go, Captain.
- Thank you.

28:26.246 --> 28:27.793
God bless the mayor.

28:27.873 --> 28:28.920
Thank you.

28:28.999 --> 28:30.342
Congratulations, sir.

28:39.301 --> 28:40.302
Hey.

28:40.427 --> 28:42.179
That son of a bitch.

28:42.679 --> 28:44.226
Keep an eye on him.

28:44.306 --> 28:45.478
Let me know if he leaves.

28:45.557 --> 28:46.649
Yep.

28:52.397 --> 28:54.991
521 Skyline
Drive, we know it. How?

28:55.067 --> 28:57.115
We got the address off one of the
Black Claw we killed in Nevada.

28:57.194 --> 28:58.634
And, it's the same
address registered

28:58.654 --> 29:00.334
to the truck parked
outside Monroe's house.

29:00.405 --> 29:02.157
The property is rural.
Five acres.

29:02.282 --> 29:04.330
Two-story house,
three points of entry,

29:04.409 --> 29:05.911
front, south side,
and the back.

29:05.994 --> 29:08.434
If that's where they've got Hank,
you have to be very careful.

29:08.497 --> 29:10.090
Just give me
Trubel and Eve.

29:11.458 --> 29:12.755
Okay.

29:13.377 --> 29:14.924
Let's go.

29:33.188 --> 29:34.781
What do you guys
hope to do here?

29:34.856 --> 29:35.948
Shut up.

29:36.024 --> 29:37.776
You think kidnapping me
is gonna get you

29:37.859 --> 29:39.532
some kind of freedom
you didn't have.

29:39.611 --> 29:41.363
You know what's going on.

29:41.446 --> 29:42.743
You work with a Grimm.

29:42.823 --> 29:44.791
I know the cost of whatever
you get out of this

29:44.866 --> 29:46.163
is gonna be very high.

29:46.243 --> 29:47.620
You're not Wesen.

29:47.703 --> 29:48.829
You'll never understand.

29:48.912 --> 29:50.835
I wonder if you do.

29:53.166 --> 29:54.338
Shut up.

29:56.503 --> 29:57.846
Back off.

30:59.232 --> 31:01.030
I don't think
Bonaparte's coming.

31:02.903 --> 31:05.622
What does he want
with this guy, anyway?

31:05.697 --> 31:07.370
He's the Grimm's partner.

31:07.449 --> 31:08.746
He knows a lot.

31:09.117 --> 31:11.415
If what he knows
is so damn valuable,

31:11.495 --> 31:13.042
why aren't we getting it
out of him?

31:13.163 --> 31:15.211
I'm guessing he doesn't
trust you with what I know.

31:15.290 --> 31:16.883
Your partner's one of us.

31:17.751 --> 31:20.550
What makes you think
that he won't switch sides

31:20.629 --> 31:22.256
when he realizes
who's going to win this?

31:42.317 --> 31:43.739
Is there anyone else here?

31:43.819 --> 31:44.911
I don't think so.

31:46.279 --> 31:47.371
There's only two?

31:48.365 --> 31:49.867
There's another one
back here.

31:55.539 --> 31:57.166
She was already dead
when I came through.

32:00.669 --> 32:02.046
I know her.

32:02.587 --> 32:04.180
That's my neighbor,
Mrs. Miller.

32:04.297 --> 32:05.389
The witness?

32:06.133 --> 32:08.181
Yeah, they got to her.

32:08.260 --> 32:09.762
This doesn't make sense.

32:09.845 --> 32:12.473
We got the same address
from three different sources

32:12.556 --> 32:14.516
and there were only two
people here guarding Hank.

32:14.558 --> 32:17.562
Yeah, you're still alive,
why didn't they kill you?

32:17.644 --> 32:19.021
They were waiting
for somebody.

32:19.104 --> 32:20.356
Who was never gonna come.

32:20.480 --> 32:21.857
They were getting
rid of us.

32:22.441 --> 32:23.909
We're in the wrong place.

32:54.598 --> 32:55.599
Ah!

33:56.451 --> 33:59.170
Go ahead, answer it.

34:02.415 --> 34:04.543
You might wanna
tell 'em what happened.

34:07.629 --> 34:08.880
Eve.

34:08.964 --> 34:10.681
Are we too late?
Yes.

34:10.757 --> 34:12.179
Don't come back.
Are you safe?

34:12.509 --> 34:14.603
No. I'm with Sean Renard.

34:15.094 --> 34:16.187
I think he wants
to kill me.

34:16.263 --> 34:17.310
No!

34:21.851 --> 34:23.853
You chose
the wrong side, Sean.

34:24.228 --> 34:25.981
I never choose sides.

34:26.606 --> 34:28.324
You shouldn't either.

34:31.360 --> 34:33.079
It doesn't have
to end here.

34:33.737 --> 34:35.739
Black Claw is Wesen only.

34:36.533 --> 34:38.534
For you, I think
we'd make an exception.

34:39.034 --> 34:40.661
There are no exceptions.

34:52.632 --> 34:54.179
That's enough.
Stay out of it!

35:09.107 --> 35:10.359
I said that's enough!

35:40.972 --> 35:42.849
You are compassionate,

35:44.059 --> 35:46.562
and that's dangerous
for all of us.

35:55.904 --> 35:57.998
This effectively
eliminates whatever presence

35:58.073 --> 36:00.075
Hadrian's Wall
had in this area.

36:00.158 --> 36:01.831
That's incredible.

36:02.577 --> 36:05.797
Rachel, you had
a big part in the success.

36:05.872 --> 36:06.998
Thank you.

36:07.582 --> 36:10.631
I don't think it could have
gone any better than it did.

36:10.710 --> 36:12.633
Except maybe
for the Grimms.

36:12.921 --> 36:14.719
We have plans
for the Grimms.

36:15.256 --> 36:17.054
And all their friends.

36:17.842 --> 36:20.436
But I'm more concerned
about Adalind.

36:21.471 --> 36:24.566
She's a Hexenbiest,
she'll come around.

36:25.016 --> 36:26.438
I'll keep my eye on her.

36:26.518 --> 36:27.895
And Renard?

36:28.061 --> 36:30.029
I have
no problem with that.

36:30.105 --> 36:32.984
I'd like you to spend
more time with Diana.

36:33.775 --> 36:35.652
I think it would
be a good idea

36:35.735 --> 36:37.578
if the two
of you get closer.

36:38.780 --> 36:40.748
Well, that
shouldn't be hard.

36:40.824 --> 36:42.292
Kids love me.

36:42.617 --> 36:43.618
Hmm.

36:56.631 --> 36:58.008
This is bad.

37:03.304 --> 37:05.557
How did they know
HW was here?

37:06.057 --> 37:07.149
Zuri.

37:07.225 --> 37:08.317
What?

37:08.476 --> 37:10.228
They knew
we would bring her here.

37:10.311 --> 37:11.437
We were all set up.

37:11.521 --> 37:14.400
Then, why didn't they attack
us when we were here?

37:14.482 --> 37:15.904
They're afraid of Eve.

37:15.984 --> 37:18.828
They wanted to get her
out of the way.

37:18.903 --> 37:21.156
I should have
seen this coming.

37:46.806 --> 37:49.935
I thought Meisner was Renard's
friend, why would he do this?

37:50.268 --> 37:52.487
Sean Renard has no friends.

37:55.732 --> 37:57.029
Nick.

37:58.568 --> 38:00.991
HW's dead in Portland.

38:02.405 --> 38:05.625
There's no one to fight
Black Claw here but us.

38:06.242 --> 38:08.620
If there's anything
important, take it.

38:08.703 --> 38:11.502
Meet me back at my place.
Drive separately.

38:11.581 --> 38:13.174
Make sure
you're not followed.

38:42.403 --> 38:43.404
Mmm.

38:55.583 --> 38:56.584
Diana?

38:56.835 --> 38:58.257
Leave us alone.

38:58.711 --> 39:00.679
I don't think you...

39:00.755 --> 39:03.008
They're my mommy
and daddy, not yours.

39:06.427 --> 39:08.100
What're you doing?

39:08.388 --> 39:09.388
Diana!

39:09.430 --> 39:12.024
Stop!

39:12.267 --> 39:14.611
Please, honey.

39:14.894 --> 39:16.692
Help, somebody!

39:16.771 --> 39:17.897
Diana, stop!

39:18.022 --> 39:19.569
Mommy,

39:20.859 --> 39:22.532
I wanna show you something.

39:32.078 --> 39:34.126
Diana,
what are you doing?

39:39.961 --> 39:42.134
Diana, stop it!

39:45.466 --> 39:47.935
She won't take
Daddy away anymore.

40:14.495 --> 40:16.293
You're not gonna do
anything stupid, are you?

40:16.372 --> 40:17.624
Hank.

40:17.916 --> 40:19.213
What the hell happened?

40:19.292 --> 40:20.509
Too much.

40:20.668 --> 40:21.840
What?

40:21.961 --> 40:23.338
Cheers. Bye.

40:25.548 --> 40:27.016
Nick, think about it.

40:27.091 --> 40:28.468
I have.

40:37.685 --> 40:39.028
Meisner's dead.

40:40.063 --> 40:41.280
Really.

40:41.356 --> 40:42.778
And how did that happen?

40:42.857 --> 40:44.609
A coward shot him.

40:45.777 --> 40:47.779
You think you're gonna
get away with this?

40:47.862 --> 40:52.538
Oh, come on, Nick, you really
want to tally up the dead?

40:53.451 --> 40:54.543
Yeah.

40:58.706 --> 41:00.458
Let's start with you.

41:12.512 --> 41:13.559
It's locked.

41:13.638 --> 41:14.639
Captain.

41:14.847 --> 41:15.848
Nick!

41:49.549 --> 41:51.597
It's over!
No!

41:58.891 --> 42:00.268
Arrest him.

42:06.274 --> 42:07.821
They can't do this.

42:08.401 --> 42:11.951
We can't help him if we’re in
the cell right next to him.

42:12.405 --> 42:15.124
They will kill him.

42:36.054 --> 42:37.977
Anybody want to tell me what
the hell happened out there?

42:38.139 --> 42:39.231
Not now.

42:39.307 --> 42:40.354
You want me to
come with you?

42:40.433 --> 42:41.935
No. Stay there.

42:42.018 --> 42:44.316
You okay? Captain's office
looks like a war zone.

42:44.395 --> 42:45.715
Why would you go
after the Captain

42:45.772 --> 42:47.240
like that right here
in the precinct?

42:47.315 --> 42:49.033
He killed Meisner.
What?

42:49.150 --> 42:50.823
Black Claw wiped out HW.

42:50.902 --> 42:51.949
No one is safe.

42:53.613 --> 42:55.456
I need you to get
everyone to my place.

42:55.531 --> 42:57.283
We can't leave you in here,
they'll get to you.

42:57.366 --> 42:58.367
If you try to
get me out now,

42:58.451 --> 42:59.651
they're gonna get
to all of us.

42:59.994 --> 43:01.371
And don't try
to do this alone.

43:01.454 --> 43:02.706
We won't.

43:10.379 --> 43:11.756
That's enough for today.

43:11.839 --> 43:14.467
Clean up the rest tomorrow.
Thank you.

43:20.681 --> 43:21.853
Yes?

43:22.183 --> 43:23.856
I just had
Burkhardt arrested.

43:23.935 --> 43:25.357
For what?
Assault.

43:25.520 --> 43:28.023
Yeah, apparently, he was
upset about Meisner's death.

43:28.106 --> 43:29.653
I've got him
in the holding cell.

43:29.732 --> 43:31.075
Well, well...

43:31.150 --> 43:33.949
This is an opportunity
I didn't think we'd have.

43:34.028 --> 43:35.780
I'd like to talk
to the Grimm.

43:35.863 --> 43:36.864
Where?

43:36.948 --> 43:38.700
You shouldn't be involved.
I'll handle it.

43:38.908 --> 43:40.080
What do you want me to do?

43:40.535 --> 43:42.208
Enjoy your night.

43:44.372 --> 43:46.170
The Grimm was arrested.

43:46.249 --> 43:48.468
He's in a holding cell
at the South Precinct.

43:48.543 --> 43:50.143
How long will it take you
to get him out?

43:50.211 --> 43:53.636
We'll need some paperwork. Couple
of hours and we'll have him.

43:53.714 --> 43:54.715
Get it done.

44:02.723 --> 44:04.100
Stay here.
Keep an eye on Nick.

44:04.183 --> 44:05.355
I'll be back
as soon as I can.

44:05.434 --> 44:06.560
Mmm-hmm.

44:07.520 --> 44:09.193
Look, I know this is
difficult for both of you.

44:09.272 --> 44:10.444
More difficult for Nick.

44:10.523 --> 44:11.820
Well, he brought this
on himself.

44:11.899 --> 44:12.991
Did he?

44:13.067 --> 44:14.410
Let me give you
a bit of advice.

44:14.485 --> 44:15.953
Stay out of it.

44:16.028 --> 44:17.154
He did this in a precinct.

44:17.238 --> 44:18.865
Do you know how many witnesses
there were to this?

44:18.948 --> 44:20.040
I had no choice.

44:20.116 --> 44:21.743
I'm sure you didn't.

44:21.826 --> 44:23.828
There are gonna be
some serious changes.

44:23.911 --> 44:25.504
You're good cops.

44:25.580 --> 44:28.459
You understand what's
really happening here.

44:29.500 --> 44:32.595
I'm hoping we can work
through our differences.

44:38.009 --> 44:39.135
Did he just say,

44:39.218 --> 44:40.686
"work through
our differences"?

44:40.761 --> 44:43.480
I know a couple of ways
we can do that.

44:43.890 --> 44:45.733
If anybody goes
near Nick, call me.

44:45.808 --> 44:46.900
Yep.

44:47.059 --> 44:49.482
I'll wait up to hear
from Nick, okay?

44:49.562 --> 44:52.691
You are drinking this tea,
and I am putting you to bed.

44:52.773 --> 44:55.151
Because if it's a stomach
bug, you need to sleep.

44:55.234 --> 44:56.907
And if you're not feeling
better in the morning,

44:56.986 --> 44:59.330
I'm taking you to a doctor.

45:00.031 --> 45:01.704
Are you okay in there?

45:01.782 --> 45:02.874
Yeah.

45:03.117 --> 45:04.243
I'll be right out.

45:04.327 --> 45:05.624
Okay.

45:05.745 --> 45:08.123
I'm gonna try Nick
one more time.

45:25.932 --> 45:28.060
You've reached Nick Burkhardt.
Leave a message.

45:28.142 --> 45:29.940
Tea's on the table.

45:30.478 --> 45:32.105
Still no answer.

45:32.480 --> 45:33.527
Monroe?

45:33.606 --> 45:35.483
Are you freakin'
kidding me?

45:35.650 --> 45:37.243
What is it?
They're back again.

45:37.318 --> 45:38.820
Same truck.

45:39.070 --> 45:41.198
What do you think
we can't see you?

45:41.280 --> 45:42.532
Enough is enough.

45:42.615 --> 45:44.208
Monroe, not tonight.

45:44.283 --> 45:45.751
I have to tell you...

45:45.826 --> 45:46.873
Did you hear that?

45:46.953 --> 45:48.455
Someone's breaking in.

45:57.546 --> 45:58.547
Whoa!

46:00.758 --> 46:01.884
Sorry.

46:02.385 --> 46:04.479
Black Claw was out front,
I had to come around back.

46:04.553 --> 46:05.679
I know, we just saw them.

46:05.763 --> 46:07.015
They're the same guys
that were here yesterday.

46:07.098 --> 46:08.975
Did you find Hank?
Yeah, we got him.

46:09.058 --> 46:11.527
But it was just to
get us out of HW.

46:11.602 --> 46:13.024
Black Claw hit the compound.

46:13.145 --> 46:14.988
What?
Killed everybody.

46:15.147 --> 46:16.147
Including Meisner.

46:16.190 --> 46:17.863
Oh, my God. Meisner?

46:18.985 --> 46:21.033
Yeah, that's why I'm here.
You guys aren't safe.

46:21.112 --> 46:22.614
Nick wants us all
to meet back at his place.

46:22.697 --> 46:24.574
Okay, but what about the
Black Claw guys out front?

46:24.657 --> 46:26.284
Shouldn't we deal
with them first?

46:26.659 --> 46:28.332
Oh, we got it covered.

46:33.541 --> 46:35.009
You know her?

46:35.376 --> 46:37.003
I don't think so.

46:42.341 --> 46:43.593
Oh, crap.

46:43.718 --> 46:45.015
Start the truck!

46:45.094 --> 46:46.311
Start the truck!

46:46.387 --> 46:47.684
Start the damn truck!

46:47.763 --> 46:49.606
What do you think
I'm trying to do?

46:49.682 --> 46:50.899
It won't start!

46:50.975 --> 46:52.943
Is it getting
hot in here? It is.

46:53.019 --> 46:54.020
It is!

46:54.103 --> 46:55.821
It's getting hot in here.

46:57.523 --> 46:59.446
Get out!

46:59.525 --> 47:00.742
Get out!

47:31.182 --> 47:32.399
Rachel.

47:41.776 --> 47:43.619
I need you to wake up.

47:44.987 --> 47:47.206
Something I have
to tell you.

47:49.367 --> 47:50.994
Rachel, hey.

48:08.010 --> 48:09.728
Nick actually
attacked him?

48:09.804 --> 48:11.477
He saw Renard
and just snapped.

48:11.555 --> 48:12.727
Inside the precinct?

48:12.807 --> 48:13.899
He couldn't be stopped.

48:13.974 --> 48:16.727
I gotta say, I'm surprised he held
it together as long as he did.

48:16.811 --> 48:17.983
I mean,
the guy took his kid!

48:18.062 --> 48:19.109
And Adalind.

48:19.188 --> 48:20.906
And killed Meisner?

48:21.148 --> 48:23.617
Renard could charge Nick with
assault, or attempted murder.

48:23.692 --> 48:25.239
Nick won't last the night.

48:25.319 --> 48:27.071
Black Claw will get to him.

48:27.154 --> 48:28.531
We gotta get him
outta there.

48:28.614 --> 48:29.991
With a precinct
full of cops?

48:30.074 --> 48:31.200
How are we gonna do that?

48:31.283 --> 48:32.830
You're not. We will.

48:32.952 --> 48:34.952
You need to get to the spice
shop and hide anything

48:34.995 --> 48:36.542
you don't want
Black Claw to find.

48:36.622 --> 48:37.714
Hide, like, where?

48:37.790 --> 48:39.292
I mean, we've got all the
books and the drawings and...

48:39.375 --> 48:40.592
And weapons.

48:40.668 --> 48:42.261
Black Claw can't get their
hands on any of that stuff.

48:42.336 --> 48:44.088
I think we gotta move it
out of the basement...

48:44.171 --> 48:46.344
No! It is too late to move anything.
Black Claw will be watching.

48:46.424 --> 48:48.017
Hide it the best you can.

48:48.843 --> 48:50.845
What about the opening
to the old sewer line?

48:51.137 --> 48:52.480
Yeah.

48:52.555 --> 48:55.183
I don't think anybody would look
down there. I know I wouldn't.

48:55.266 --> 48:57.189
Okay, then get back
to the loft.

48:57.268 --> 48:58.690
Hopefully we'll have
Nick by then.

48:59.728 --> 49:01.321
And if you don't?

49:02.356 --> 49:03.733
Then you're on your own.

49:30.926 --> 49:32.098
Rachel's dead.

49:32.928 --> 49:34.100
What are you talking about?

49:34.180 --> 49:35.648
Suffocated to death.
In her bed.

49:35.723 --> 49:38.476
And it wasn't an accident or
something a normal person could do.

49:38.559 --> 49:39.651
Do we know who did it?

49:39.727 --> 49:41.980
Someone who didn't
like her very much.

49:42.062 --> 49:44.110
Where is Adalind?
She's upstairs.

49:44.773 --> 49:46.275
But I don't think
Adalind even knew

49:46.358 --> 49:47.826
about your relationship
with Rachel.

49:48.527 --> 49:51.497
And even if she did, she
doesn't care enough about you

49:51.572 --> 49:52.869
to have done
anything about it.

49:52.948 --> 49:54.996
Well, somebody had
the ability to do it.

49:55.075 --> 49:56.327
It wasn't me.

49:56.410 --> 49:57.411
Then who?

50:01.207 --> 50:05.553
I didn't think she was
capable at such a young age,

50:05.628 --> 50:06.720
but maybe she is.

50:08.047 --> 50:09.173
Diana?

50:09.965 --> 50:11.763
She could have perceived
Rachel as a threat

50:11.842 --> 50:12.889
to her mother and you.

50:12.968 --> 50:14.094
And her family.

50:14.261 --> 50:16.309
But Diana hasn't even
left the house.

50:17.306 --> 50:18.774
Would she need to?

50:26.106 --> 50:27.779
All right. Everything
should fit in here.

50:27.858 --> 50:29.658
We're just gonna have
to cover it really well.

50:29.777 --> 50:31.199
I miss Juliette,
but I'm sure glad

50:31.278 --> 50:32.655
we have Eve
on our side right now.

50:32.738 --> 50:35.708
Well, I have a feeling we're gonna
need her and a whole lot more.

50:35.783 --> 50:36.875
Oh, my God.

50:36.951 --> 50:40.125
This is one of the books
my Uncle Felix died for.

50:40.788 --> 50:42.335
Oh, the Grimm Ancestry book.

50:42.414 --> 50:44.963
Can you imagine if Black
Claw got a hold of this?

50:45.042 --> 50:47.886
They could hunt down
and kill every Grimm.

50:47.962 --> 50:49.760
There's no way

50:49.838 --> 50:52.216
they are getting their
stinking hands on this baby.

50:55.511 --> 50:56.888
Are you okay?

50:56.971 --> 50:58.689
Your stomach still
bothering you?

50:58.764 --> 50:59.765
Um...

51:01.141 --> 51:03.564
No, I was just thinking...

51:04.687 --> 51:06.906
What if Black Claw
is successful?

51:06.981 --> 51:08.574
What's the world
gonna be like?

51:09.650 --> 51:12.119
Black Claw is not
gonna be successful.

51:13.320 --> 51:15.414
Not as long as
I'm alive anyway.

51:20.160 --> 51:22.379
What do you wanna
do with these weapons?

51:23.497 --> 51:25.465
Take what we can
to Nick's, I guess.

51:25.541 --> 51:27.339
God, I hope he's okay.

51:28.168 --> 51:29.385
Me, too.

51:34.341 --> 51:35.763
Can you freakin'
believe this?

51:35.843 --> 51:38.141
At this hour, all these crimes
happening at the same time?

51:38.220 --> 51:40.097
We got 911 calls
coming out of our ass.

51:40.180 --> 51:42.603
I know, I know. I got a robbery
in progress in the Pearl.

51:42.683 --> 51:44.777
Here's another one.
Yeah, that's one of six.

51:44.852 --> 51:46.320
You coming?
I'll catch up with you.

51:50.274 --> 51:52.117
We can't bail Nick
out until bail is set,

51:52.192 --> 51:53.819
And that won't happen
until he's in front of a judge.

51:53.944 --> 51:55.984
Black Claw's
not gonna wait that long.

51:56.030 --> 51:57.373
I say we go in there
and break him out.

51:57.448 --> 51:58.950
Too many cops.

51:59.533 --> 52:00.750
What's up, Wu?

52:00.826 --> 52:02.999
Something weird is going on.

52:03.245 --> 52:04.337
What?

52:04.413 --> 52:06.165
Precinct just got slammed
with 911 calls.

52:06.248 --> 52:09.001
Place cleared out except for
me and a couple of desk cops.

52:09.084 --> 52:10.336
They're going after Nick.

52:10.419 --> 52:12.137
They're getting rid of
anyone who can stop them.

52:12.212 --> 52:13.839
We need to slow them down.

52:13.922 --> 52:15.720
Lock the precinct up.
We're on our way.

52:31.398 --> 52:32.945
Ada/ind?

52:33.901 --> 52:35.995
Wu? Where's Nick?

52:37.905 --> 52:39.202
He's been arrested.

52:39.281 --> 52:40.328
What?

52:40.407 --> 52:44.002
He and Renard kind of got into it.
And I don't mean verbally.

52:44.078 --> 52:46.672
HW was wiped out.
Renard killed Meisner.

52:46.789 --> 52:48.336
Meisner is dead?

52:48.415 --> 52:49.507
Really can't talk
right now.

52:49.583 --> 52:50.675
Uh, wait, Wu.

52:50.751 --> 52:52.378
Okay, can you get Nick
a message for me?

52:52.503 --> 52:54.380
I can try.

52:54.463 --> 52:57.262
Uh, can you just
tell him I'm sorry

52:57.341 --> 53:00.720
and that Kelly's good
and I love him.

53:00.803 --> 53:02.020
And if there's any...

53:04.223 --> 53:05.896
Adalind?

53:17.319 --> 53:18.445
Hey.

53:19.947 --> 53:21.119
You're still awake.

53:21.281 --> 53:24.285
Just a little hard to sleep with
all that's going on downstairs.

53:24.952 --> 53:27.046
What happened
to your face?

53:27.121 --> 53:29.123
Rough night
at the precinct.

53:32.876 --> 53:34.173
Rachel's dead.

53:34.962 --> 53:36.009
Dead?

53:36.088 --> 53:38.056
Yeah, smothered to death
in her own bed.

53:38.549 --> 53:39.926
How long's Diana
been asleep?

53:40.008 --> 53:41.430
Couple of hours. Why?

53:41.468 --> 53:43.311
I think we need to talk to her.
About what?

53:43.387 --> 53:44.730
About killing people.

53:46.515 --> 53:47.937
Did you encourage her?

53:48.016 --> 53:50.610
To kill your girlfriend?
Yeah, Sean.

53:50.686 --> 53:52.984
I told my daughter to murder
her daddy's mistress.

53:53.063 --> 53:54.406
What kind of mother
do you think I am?

53:54.481 --> 53:57.234
She wants us to be together. She might
have perceived Rachel as a threat.

53:57.359 --> 53:59.782
Well, that's your doing,
not mine.

54:00.654 --> 54:01.951
Who gave you that?

54:03.073 --> 54:04.416
Oh, you don't know?

54:04.575 --> 54:05.792
Know what?

54:05.909 --> 54:07.877
I guess you forgot
you proposed.

54:07.953 --> 54:09.170
We're getting married.

54:09.246 --> 54:10.418
When is that happening?

54:10.539 --> 54:11.756
I don't know.

54:11.832 --> 54:14.051
You'll have to ask Bonaparte.
He's the wedding planner.

54:14.209 --> 54:16.177
Well, then I guess
I'm staying here tonight.

54:16.253 --> 54:18.693
Don't want Bonaparte to think
we're not taking this seriously.

54:21.049 --> 54:22.346
Relax.

54:23.093 --> 54:24.970
I'll sleep over there.

54:25.179 --> 54:27.807
I've had enough tragedy
for one night.

54:46.158 --> 54:48.081
Sure sent a lot
of you for one guy.

54:48.160 --> 54:49.457
Apparently,
he's not safe here.

54:49.536 --> 54:51.083
Hey, Detective, I guess
you're getting transferred

54:51.163 --> 54:52.163
to the North Precinct.

54:52.206 --> 54:53.753
No, they have no authority
to move me.

54:53.832 --> 54:55.709
Paperwork says they do.

55:01.048 --> 55:03.221
Don't make this any harder
than it has to be.

55:20.943 --> 55:22.695
We got him.
We're on our way.

55:22.778 --> 55:23.995
Any problems?

55:24.071 --> 55:25.197
He's smarter than that.

55:26.073 --> 55:27.074
Good.

55:28.742 --> 55:29.994
Hey, whoa, whoa.
What's going on here?

55:30.077 --> 55:31.124
We're moving a prisoner.

55:31.245 --> 55:33.043
Uh, not that one. Just got a
call from Captain Renard.

55:33.121 --> 55:34.839
Told me to get Burkhardt
into an interrogation room,

55:34.915 --> 55:35.915
he's on his way here.

55:35.958 --> 55:37.210
Back off, Sergeant!

55:37.292 --> 55:39.670
He is not leaving
this precinct.

55:41.088 --> 55:43.762
Get off me!
These are Captain's orders!

55:55.853 --> 55:57.150
Wu.

56:02.109 --> 56:03.531
Wu, it's me!

56:03.694 --> 56:05.241
Wu!

56:18.417 --> 56:19.464
What happened?

56:20.627 --> 56:22.254
- They got Nick.
- Who?

56:23.005 --> 56:24.348
These guys are
North Precinct.

56:24.423 --> 56:26.266
Same as the guys
that arrested me.

56:26.341 --> 56:28.435
Nick told me that precinct
was Black Claw.

56:28.510 --> 56:31.138
Well, if they control it, that's
probably where they took him.

56:31.221 --> 56:32.313
Are you okay?

56:32.389 --> 56:34.608
No, I'm pissed.
Good. Let's go.

56:56.413 --> 56:57.960
You're in
our house now, Grimm.

56:58.040 --> 56:59.963
Welcome to the North
Precinct, Detective.

57:00.042 --> 57:03.137
We do things a little
differently around here.

57:15.307 --> 57:17.526
I tell you,
you're dead, Grimm!

57:17.768 --> 57:19.486
The Grimm killed
my family.

57:19.561 --> 57:21.279
Never seen
a Grimm before.

57:21.355 --> 57:22.732
What a letdown!

57:22.814 --> 57:24.254
What do
you think you are?

57:24.608 --> 57:25.860
You're dead, Grimm.

57:26.193 --> 57:27.536
You're dead!

57:27.694 --> 57:28.911
Guys...

57:44.211 --> 57:45.463
Detective Burkhardt.

57:45.545 --> 57:46.797
Thanks for coming.

57:46.880 --> 57:48.006
What do you want?

57:48.090 --> 57:49.387
What everybody wants.

57:49.549 --> 57:50.801
Freedom.

57:51.218 --> 57:53.220
Freedom to be who we are.

57:53.595 --> 57:55.939
But I guess you wouldn't
understand that.

57:56.223 --> 57:57.600
I hope you didn't
bring me here

57:57.683 --> 57:59.936
to complain about
how unfair life is.

58:00.018 --> 58:01.691
No.

58:01.895 --> 58:03.772
I find that boring, too.

58:04.898 --> 58:06.741
You have a book I want.

58:08.151 --> 58:10.495
We had just found out
where it was.

58:10.570 --> 58:13.039
In the hands of
another Grimm,

58:13.115 --> 58:16.915
a Mr. Josef Nebojsa
in Prague.

58:18.245 --> 58:22.466
We tracked it to
a book dealer in Leipzig

58:22.541 --> 58:25.511
and then here
to Portland.

58:26.378 --> 58:29.598
Turns out the book dealer
who bought it

58:30.924 --> 58:33.427
is related to
a friend of yours.

58:34.720 --> 58:38.315
The book dealer
was Blutbaden,

58:38.390 --> 58:41.269
yet he chose to give
the book to a Grimm.

58:42.269 --> 58:45.648
I believe that you now
have that book.

58:46.940 --> 58:49.034
And you will
give it to me.

58:53.488 --> 58:55.411
All of this for a book?

58:55.490 --> 58:57.618
That book is one of a kind.

58:58.035 --> 59:01.790
It documents every Grimm,
living or dead.

59:02.497 --> 59:04.591
Some will join
our revolution,

59:04.666 --> 59:06.839
and others, like you,
will not.

59:08.128 --> 59:10.222
But we need to know
who they are.

59:10.464 --> 59:13.183
Well, I'd like to help you,
but I'm not going to.

59:13.258 --> 59:15.431
Oh, I believe you are.

59:30.525 --> 59:32.072
Are you all right?

59:32.152 --> 59:33.620
I don't know.

59:33.820 --> 59:35.697
Must have been a dream.

59:36.031 --> 59:37.533
Yeah, I guess.

59:37.741 --> 59:39.334
What time is it?

59:42.037 --> 59:43.334
3230.

59:43.497 --> 59:45.124
Go back to sleep.

59:57.803 --> 59:59.771
Where's Kelly?
What are you talking about?

59:59.846 --> 01:00:01.189
He's asleep in the crib.

01:00:01.264 --> 01:00:02.937
No, he's not. Where is he?

01:00:11.858 --> 01:00:12.859
No!

01:00:36.550 --> 01:00:38.518
Kelly.

01:00:39.052 --> 01:00:42.181
Give me the book and you
can have your son back.

01:00:42.722 --> 01:00:45.646
If you don't,
you will never see him again.

01:00:45.767 --> 01:00:48.486
And, I mean, never.

01:00:48.562 --> 01:00:49.734
Where is he?

01:00:50.522 --> 01:00:52.570
What did you do with him?

01:00:52.899 --> 01:00:54.867
Where's my son?

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:57.488
It's an easy choice,
Burkhardt.

01:00:58.071 --> 01:00:59.493
Give me the book.

01:01:08.915 --> 01:01:10.258
I need your help.

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:11.630
What's wrong?

01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:13.758
I'm looking for
Detective Burkhardt.

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:16.764
Uh, there's no
Detective Burkhardt here.

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:18.842
- I think there is.
- Didn't you hear her?

01:01:18.925 --> 01:01:20.973
There's no Burkhardt here.

01:01:25.849 --> 01:01:27.476
Let me rephrase.

01:01:27.559 --> 01:01:30.108
I'm looking for
Detective Burkhardt.

01:01:31.396 --> 01:01:32.739
He's here.

01:01:32.939 --> 01:01:34.316
He's upstairs.

01:01:46.036 --> 01:01:48.209
If I tell you
where the book is,

01:01:48.288 --> 01:01:50.006
what's to stop you
from killing me?

01:01:50.415 --> 01:01:52.213
We set up an exchange.

01:01:53.084 --> 01:01:54.882
How's that gonna work?

01:01:55.295 --> 01:01:57.138
Adalind will
never give up her son.

01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:59.508
I'll deal with Adalind.

01:02:00.175 --> 01:02:03.224
You arrange for the book
to be delivered here,

01:02:03.303 --> 01:02:07.149
and I'll arrange for Kelly to
be delivered wherever you want.

01:03:09.202 --> 01:03:10.875
You must be Eve.

01:03:38.064 --> 01:03:39.111
Where's Eve?

01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:41.989
She went after Bonaparte.
Which way?

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:21.032
I didn't know...

01:04:21.107 --> 01:04:23.610
I didn't know
he was a Zauberbiest.

01:04:26.321 --> 01:04:27.664
We need to get you
out of here.

01:04:27.739 --> 01:04:29.207
She's losing
a lot of blood.

01:04:29.282 --> 01:04:30.454
We can't take her
to the hospital,

01:04:30.533 --> 01:04:31.973
that's the first place
they'll check.

01:04:32.243 --> 01:04:33.961
He got out.
The loft.

01:04:34.037 --> 01:04:35.038
I'll bring the car up.

01:04:35.455 --> 01:04:37.002
Get Monroe and Rosalee.

01:04:37.082 --> 01:04:39.881
Black Claw will try
to kill them tonight.

01:04:42.545 --> 01:04:43.967
Something's not right.

01:04:44.923 --> 01:04:46.095
Oh, with you?

01:04:46.299 --> 01:04:47.471
No.

01:04:47.675 --> 01:04:48.767
Eve.

01:04:51.096 --> 01:04:52.894
I think she's dying.

01:04:52.972 --> 01:04:54.189
What?

01:04:55.141 --> 01:04:56.233
How do you know?

01:04:56.851 --> 01:04:59.855
I don't know,
I just feel it.

01:05:06.986 --> 01:05:08.112
Who is it?

01:05:08.196 --> 01:05:09.493
Bonaparte.

01:05:13.201 --> 01:05:15.044
What's wrong?
What's going on?

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:16.121
Where's Burkhardt?

01:05:16.871 --> 01:05:18.088
How would I know
where he is?

01:05:18.164 --> 01:05:19.666
Tell me where he lives.

01:05:21.334 --> 01:05:23.757
You think this is a game?

01:05:28.466 --> 01:05:30.013
Tell me where he lives.

01:05:35.515 --> 01:05:36.562
Tell him.

01:05:36.891 --> 01:05:37.892
Tell him!

01:05:38.393 --> 01:05:40.191
Bonaparte, we need her.

01:05:40.353 --> 01:05:42.697
Where does he live?

01:05:44.023 --> 01:05:47.448
5720
Northwest Nicolai Street.

01:05:51.030 --> 01:05:52.623
They all die tonight.

01:06:04.377 --> 01:06:06.254
What about the chest?
Should we hide the chest?

01:06:06.463 --> 01:06:07.885
Why would we hide the chest?
There's nothing in it.

01:06:08.047 --> 01:06:09.173
Yeah, I know.

01:06:09.257 --> 01:06:10.975
But, like, what if they knew
my Uncle Felix had it?

01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:12.410
If they knew
my Uncle Felix had it,

01:06:12.469 --> 01:06:13.721
then they would know
he gave it to me.

01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:15.726
And if they knew he gave it to me, then...
Stop, stop.

01:06:15.805 --> 01:06:16.852
Let them find the chest.

01:06:16.931 --> 01:06:18.057
If they know about it,
they'll think

01:06:18.141 --> 01:06:19.421
we took the books
someplace else.

01:06:19.517 --> 01:06:20.518
Yeah.

01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:22.903
Okay, I think that's right.

01:06:22.979 --> 01:06:24.196
But what if...

01:06:24.272 --> 01:06:25.398
What was that?

01:06:25.899 --> 01:06:27.526
Someone's in the shop.

01:06:52.175 --> 01:06:54.598
Monroe, Rosalee,
you down there? Trubel?

01:06:55.637 --> 01:06:58.231
Yeah, it's me and Wu.

01:06:58.306 --> 01:06:59.432
How many more are there?

01:06:59.516 --> 01:07:01.063
None alive.
We gotta go now.

01:07:11.528 --> 01:07:12.654
Keep pressure on the wound.

01:07:12.737 --> 01:07:13.738
Where you going?

01:07:13.821 --> 01:07:14.993
The tunnel.

01:07:56.155 --> 01:07:57.327
Diana.

01:07:57.407 --> 01:07:58.408
Honey, wake up.

01:07:58.491 --> 01:08:00.243
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

01:08:01.286 --> 01:08:02.754
I need your help.

01:08:02.829 --> 01:08:04.376
What's wrong, Mommy?

01:08:04.497 --> 01:08:06.625
I need you to get a message
to Kelly's daddy, Nick.

01:08:06.708 --> 01:08:09.382
His mommy helped raise you when
you were a little girl, remember?

01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:12.263
Well, he needs
our help now.

01:08:12.463 --> 01:08:13.965
Is he in trouble?

01:08:14.507 --> 01:08:15.599
Yes.

01:08:15.675 --> 01:08:18.303
That's why I need you
to get him a message.

01:08:18.386 --> 01:08:20.604
But it has to be
a secret, okay?

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:22.182
Nobody can know
what we did.

01:08:22.307 --> 01:08:23.524
Okay.

01:08:24.517 --> 01:08:25.564
Okay.

01:08:26.685 --> 01:08:28.609
We're losing her, Nick.

01:08:36.571 --> 01:08:38.331
I hope that thing does
what we think it does.

01:08:38.406 --> 01:08:39.749
Yeah, me, too.

01:08:45.872 --> 01:08:46.964
Nothing's happening.

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:48.212
Maybe we're crazy.

01:08:51.544 --> 01:08:52.716
Wait...

01:08:54.046 --> 01:08:55.299
Her skin is turning white.

01:08:55.381 --> 01:08:56.473
Something is happening.

01:08:56.549 --> 01:08:57.595
Yeah.

01:09:00.595 --> 01:09:01.812
Yeah, looks like
it's working.

01:09:01.888 --> 01:09:03.231
It's healing her.

01:09:06.893 --> 01:09:09.237
I don't believe
what I just saw.

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:11.613
How does that work?

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:13.612
I'm not going to worry
about it right now.

01:09:13.733 --> 01:09:14.984
Nick...

01:09:15.068 --> 01:09:18.162
Eve, how do you feel?

01:09:18.904 --> 01:09:20.372
I don't know.

01:09:22.575 --> 01:09:23.952
Something is...

01:09:37.048 --> 01:09:39.095
What's happening?
I don't know.

01:09:52.729 --> 01:09:53.947
Eve.

01:09:54.732 --> 01:09:56.075
I don't know
what went wrong.

01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:57.868
Maybe because
she's a Hexenbiest.

01:10:08.663 --> 01:10:10.040
Black Claw hit the shop.

01:10:10.123 --> 01:10:11.215
Got out just in time.

01:10:11.290 --> 01:10:13.258
The books are safe.
At least for now.

01:10:13.793 --> 01:10:15.045
What's wrong with Eve?

01:10:15.128 --> 01:10:17.551
Well, she had a fight with
Bonaparte and was hurt.

01:10:17.922 --> 01:10:19.424
She has a pulse,
but it's weak.

01:10:19.507 --> 01:10:21.134
How the hell did Bonaparte
get the best of Eve?

01:10:21.217 --> 01:10:23.185
Well, he's a Zauberbiest.
What?

01:10:23.261 --> 01:10:24.558
A full-blown Zauberbiest?

01:10:24.637 --> 01:10:25.889
Like nothing
I've ever seen before.

01:10:25.972 --> 01:10:27.269
We used the stick
to heal her.

01:10:27.348 --> 01:10:28.816
What do you mean?
It didn't work?

01:10:28.891 --> 01:10:31.771
Well, we thought it did, and then she
Woged and had some kind of seizure.

01:10:31.811 --> 01:10:33.563
I think we're dealing
with something very powerful,

01:10:33.646 --> 01:10:36.365
and we have no idea what this thing is.

01:10:36.441 --> 01:10:38.114
Oh, I don't like that.

01:10:42.155 --> 01:10:44.123
Nick?

01:10:53.708 --> 01:10:56.131
Mommy wants me
to tell you something.

01:10:56.335 --> 01:10:57.427
Diana?

01:10:58.087 --> 01:11:00.966
Daddy's bad friend made
Mommy tell him something.

01:11:01.048 --> 01:11:02.391
What did she tell him?

01:11:02.467 --> 01:11:03.969
Where you live.

01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:05.265
Oh, boy.

01:11:05.470 --> 01:11:09.020
She feels bad. And she wants
me to tell you she's sorry.

01:11:11.184 --> 01:11:12.652
That was Diana?

01:11:12.769 --> 01:11:14.066
It had to be.

01:11:14.145 --> 01:11:15.362
They know
where we are, Nick.

01:11:15.438 --> 01:11:16.439
They'll come after us.

01:11:16.522 --> 01:11:18.524
Monroe, go to the fire
escape, keep watch.

01:11:18.608 --> 01:11:19.609
Trubel, go with him.

01:11:19.692 --> 01:11:21.865
Wu, Hank, help me
close the shutters.

01:11:27.033 --> 01:11:28.580
I don't see anything.
Do you see anything?

01:11:28.659 --> 01:11:29.876
Not yet.

01:11:30.912 --> 01:11:32.952
Maybe we still have
time to get out of here.

01:11:36.542 --> 01:11:38.169
I told them, Mommy.

01:11:38.252 --> 01:11:40.220
You sure Nick got the message?
Yes.

01:11:40.379 --> 01:11:42.177
There were a lot
of people there.

01:11:42.256 --> 01:11:43.803
You did
such a good job.

01:11:43.883 --> 01:11:45.635
You're such a good girl.

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:50.143
Mommy, what happened
to your neck?

01:11:51.224 --> 01:11:53.318
Someone got angry with me.

01:11:53.893 --> 01:11:55.236
He hurt you.

01:11:55.311 --> 01:11:57.484
Yes, he did.

01:11:58.564 --> 01:11:59.907
Was it Daddy?

01:12:00.066 --> 01:12:02.068
No, no, of course not.

01:12:02.735 --> 01:12:04.078
Then who?

01:12:05.613 --> 01:12:07.160
It was a friend of Daddy's,

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:09.584
but don't worry
about that, okay?

01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:11.706
Let's get you back to bed.

01:12:11.786 --> 01:12:13.709
Come on,
I'll lie down with you.

01:12:16.874 --> 01:12:18.421
Oh, my God, look.

01:12:20.336 --> 01:12:22.179
There's more over there.

01:12:31.889 --> 01:12:33.436
Black Claw is
surrounding the building.

01:12:33.516 --> 01:12:34.688
There's way too
many of them, Nick.

01:12:34.767 --> 01:12:35.939
We cannot fight
our way out!

01:12:36.018 --> 01:12:37.520
We have to stop them
from getting in.

01:12:37.603 --> 01:12:38.855
All right,
can we lock the elevator?

01:12:38.938 --> 01:12:40.940
Only by turning off the power.
Where is it?

01:12:41.566 --> 01:12:43.443
Downstairs.

01:12:44.402 --> 01:12:45.654
What the hell was that?

01:12:52.076 --> 01:12:53.248
They're in.

01:13:03.796 --> 01:13:05.423
Everybody into the tunnel!

01:13:05.464 --> 01:13:07.387
Tunnel? What tunnel? But we
don't know where it leads.

01:13:07.466 --> 01:13:08.558
Time to find out.

01:13:08.634 --> 01:13:10.307
Nick, if we get trapped
down there, we're dead.

01:13:10.386 --> 01:13:11.466
If we stay here,
we're dead.

01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:12.813
What about Eve?

01:13:12.889 --> 01:13:14.141
I got her.

01:13:25.234 --> 01:13:26.360
Go.

01:13:26.485 --> 01:13:27.532
Eve.

01:13:35.828 --> 01:13:37.705
Eve, we have to go.

01:13:38.998 --> 01:13:40.875
Where are
you taking me?

01:13:40.958 --> 01:13:42.175
We have to hide.

01:13:43.878 --> 01:13:44.925
What's happening to me?

01:13:45.004 --> 01:13:46.472
I don't know.

01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:51.097
I don't understand.

01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:56.441
Nick, what's
happening to me?

01:13:59.810 --> 01:14:01.187
Juliette...

01:14:03.064 --> 01:14:04.190
Nick, we gotta go.

01:14:08.361 --> 01:14:09.704
Come on.

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:29.302
Nick, come on, let's go.

01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:33.302
Keep moving.

01:14:33.386 --> 01:14:34.558
What? No!
Nick!

01:14:36.013 --> 01:14:37.811
Nick! Nick!
Trubel!

01:14:37.890 --> 01:14:39.490
Trubel, let's go.
We have to keep moving.

01:14:39.517 --> 01:14:41.190
Come on, this way.

01:16:51.607 --> 01:16:53.575
All right,
through here.

01:16:53.651 --> 01:16:54.777
There's a ladder.

01:16:54.902 --> 01:16:56.779
- Nick's up there alone, I have to go back!
- No!

01:16:56.862 --> 01:16:58.284
Listen,

01:16:58.697 --> 01:17:00.620
the only thing we can do
for Nick right now

01:17:00.699 --> 01:17:02.201
is make sure
we all get out of here

01:17:02.284 --> 01:17:06.130
so we can come back and kill every
last one of those bastards.

01:17:07.498 --> 01:17:08.795
Trubel, Monroe's right.

01:17:08.874 --> 01:17:12.299
Nick bought us time. We have
to keep moving. Come on.

01:17:25.349 --> 01:17:26.349
Which way?

01:17:26.392 --> 01:17:27.484
We went this way
last time.

01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:28.937
Come on.

01:17:31.438 --> 01:17:32.439
Hey.

01:17:37.069 --> 01:17:39.697
I'm gonna stay here with Eve,
make sure nobody follows us.

01:17:42.241 --> 01:17:44.869
It's a good place
to defend ourselves.

01:17:45.035 --> 01:17:47.288
Okay, well, be careful.

01:18:00.217 --> 01:18:02.936
This is as far as
we got the last time.

01:18:05.222 --> 01:18:07.065
We'll check out down here.

01:18:07.141 --> 01:18:10.441
We'll see if there's an exit
further down this way.

01:18:12.479 --> 01:18:13.651
How you feeling?

01:18:15.858 --> 01:18:17.451
I feel...

01:18:18.611 --> 01:18:19.783
A lot.

01:19:29.556 --> 01:19:31.604
It's over.

01:19:31.684 --> 01:19:32.731
Yeah.

01:19:34.186 --> 01:19:35.312
Yeah.

01:19:35.396 --> 01:19:36.773
Roger that.

01:19:39.608 --> 01:19:41.235
HOW the hell?

01:19:51.078 --> 01:19:52.796
There's an
opening up ahead.

01:19:52.871 --> 01:19:54.043
Well,
can you see what it is?

01:19:54.123 --> 01:19:55.796
I think it might
be away out.

01:20:08.053 --> 01:20:09.054
Hey.

01:20:10.472 --> 01:20:12.190
Oh, come On!

01:20:12.266 --> 01:20:15.566
We need, like, a
hacksaw to cut through this.

01:20:15.644 --> 01:20:17.564
We're gonna have to go back
and find another way.

01:20:18.605 --> 01:20:20.027
Monroe. Hank might
have found a way.

01:20:20.107 --> 01:20:21.233
I'm pregnant.

01:20:23.861 --> 01:20:25.033
What did you say?

01:20:27.031 --> 01:20:30.877
I'm sorry, I... This is not
how I wanted to tell you.

01:20:31.243 --> 01:20:33.763
I kept thinking that the right
time would present itself, but...

01:20:35.664 --> 01:20:37.792
Yeah, I'm pregnant.

01:20:39.084 --> 01:20:42.088
How did you...
I mean, when?

01:20:42.504 --> 01:20:44.051
Earlier today.

01:20:44.673 --> 01:20:46.641
I did the home test,
like, three times.

01:20:49.845 --> 01:20:51.222
I know this is...

01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:55.017
This is
probably like the last thing

01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:56.647
you want to hear right now

01:20:56.727 --> 01:20:58.445
with everything
that's going on.

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:00.318
Are you kidding me?

01:21:00.522 --> 01:21:02.695
It's the only thing
I want to hear.

01:21:04.818 --> 01:21:06.866
No matter what's going on.

01:21:37.976 --> 01:21:39.819
I underestimated you.

01:21:42.106 --> 01:21:44.825
I didn't think
a Grimm could do this.

01:21:46.026 --> 01:21:50.873
Book or no book, I should have
killed you when I had the chance.

01:21:53.283 --> 01:21:55.832
But I won't make
that mistake again.
