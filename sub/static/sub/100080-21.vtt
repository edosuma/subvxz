able to make it to things.

00:20.107 --> 00:21.978

to date a SWAT officer,

00:22.022 --> 00:24.285

He's gonna continue driving
drunk until he hurts himself

00:30.030 --> 00:32.380

all of SWAT to get to me.

on an El Septimo warehouse.

01:42.058 --> 01:44.016

to the Mexican government

01:44.060 --> 01:46.367
that he and his El Septimo
cartel are above the law.

01:46.410 --> 01:48.543
He thinks he's untouchable,
and in Mexico he might be,

01:48.586 --> 01:51.894
which is why he hasn't steppedfoot on U.S. soil in five years.

01:51.937 --> 01:54.375
Agent Simons here and the
rest of his DEA colleagues

01:54.418 --> 01:56.551

we've had no idea how

02:03.558 --> 02:05.516
Before he was grabbed,he managed to transmit

02:11.696 --> 02:13.089
That's right, the
El Septimo cartel

02:13.133 --> 02:15.047
takes full advantageof this public use landing strip

02:15.091 --> 02:17.180
because it has no customs
or control tower.

02:17.224 --> 02:18.921
They drop their drugs,turn around and take off?

02:18.964 --> 02:21.097
What about border security? Howdo they even make it this far?

02:21.141 --> 02:23.230
Apparently, the Septimos
have been analyzing

02:23.273 --> 02:25.362
the FAA monitoring practices,
studying their radar

02:25.406 --> 02:27.538

and they found a blind spot.

02:27.582 --> 02:29.018
The planes cross
the border

02:29.061 --> 02:30.976
way out over the ocean,
but they stay low enough

02:31.020 --> 02:33.283
to avoid radar
until they reach...

02:33.327 --> 02:36.025
Catalina Island...
where they pivot,

02:36.068 --> 02:37.461
slip right throughthe airspace gap

02:37.505 --> 02:39.246
into Baldwin Hills Airport.

02:39.289 --> 02:41.248

it just looks like your average

02:43.598 --> 02:45.339

02:45.382 --> 02:47.254
According to our intel,
tomorrow morning a twin-engine

prepared for a large-scale

02:55.349 --> 02:56.872

02:56.915 --> 02:58.395
SWAT to be the primary.

02:58.439 --> 03:00.267
Our pleasure.Now, El Septimo

03:00.310 --> 03:02.225
is highly trained,
heavily armed,

03:02.269 --> 03:04.140

about mental health resources
that they can take advantage of

04:50.594 --> 04:51.943
in the LAPD.

04:51.987 --> 04:53.728

get it on their radar

04:53.771 --> 04:55.773
early in their careers,
normalize the discussion...

04:55.817 --> 04:57.427
It cuts through the stigma.Right.

04:57.471 --> 04:59.255
But then I was thinking
it might be more effective

04:59.299 --> 05:01.083
if it came from somebody
that they admire,

05:01.126 --> 05:03.346

discuss anything personal.

10:32.762 --> 10:34.721
We need Mobile Command on-site
to broadcast

10:34.764 --> 10:37.724
any prowler 911 calls
and pull every security cam

10:37.767 --> 10:39.421
in the area to help us
narrow down the search.

10:39.464 --> 10:41.336
All right. Roger that,Hondo. We're on our way.

10:41.379 --> 10:44.469
This is R-Commander. I needall units in the area responding

10:44.513 --> 10:46.733
and a K-9 grid search initiated.

10:46.776 --> 10:48.517
Each handler getwith a SWAT team.

10:48.560 --> 10:49.910
What the hell happened
to the mission?

10:49.953 --> 10:53.000
Air-17, let's expand that grid
on all four sides.

10:53.043 --> 10:54.610
MAN:
Roger that, Commander.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.394
We have a serious situation.

11:02.226 --> 11:03.924
Some blood in the cockpit

11:03.967 --> 11:05.447
and outside the plane,but no heroin.

11:05.490 --> 11:07.362
If they weren'tsmuggling heroin,

11:07.405 --> 11:09.320
what were they smuggling?We'll figure that out later.

11:09.364 --> 11:10.670
Right now it looks like
we got six Septimos

11:10.713 --> 11:11.932
at large in this neighborhood.

11:11.975 --> 11:13.673
Chris and Street,
you partner with K-9.

11:13.716 --> 11:16.153
See if they can pick up a
trail on Stockwell Avenue.

11:16.197 --> 11:17.459
We know at least one
of them is injured,

11:17.502 --> 11:18.852
so keep your eyes
open for blood.

11:18.895 --> 11:21.550
Luca, Tan, we got to
get you a block east.

11:21.593 --> 11:23.813
Deacon and I will follow
a street over on Vesta.

11:23.857 --> 11:25.293
We'll sweep from south to north.

11:25.336 --> 11:26.903
Becker's teamis en route.

11:26.947 --> 11:29.123
They'll start on Segundoand move south towards us.

11:29.166 --> 11:30.864
If the suspects are inthis grid, then we squeeze them.

11:30.907 --> 11:32.735
This op ain't over
until all six of them

11:32.779 --> 11:33.997
are brought in. Am I clear?

11:34.041 --> 11:35.956

12:24.961 --> 12:27.442

12:34.492 --> 12:36.059
Which way?I didn't get eyes.

12:36.103 --> 12:37.408
Had to duck for cover
and wait for you all.

12:37.452 --> 12:38.801
Okay. You did
the right thing.

12:38.845 --> 12:40.411
LUCA:
Hey, he needs an ambulance.

12:40.455 --> 12:41.978
It could be a few minutes
before we stop the shooter

12:42.022 --> 12:43.414
and clear the area.LUCA:
That's too long.

12:43.458 --> 12:46.330
Hondo, we got to get
this guy to a hospital!

12:46.374 --> 12:47.767
I can get him there.
I can do it.

13:02.216 --> 13:03.347

This is gonna be really hardfor you to hear.

14:38.790 --> 14:40.792
No.

14:42.272 --> 14:45.275
My teammates,they rushed him to the hospital.

The others got to be close.

15:06.470 --> 15:09.821
You take Chris and the K-9 and
see if you can pick up a trail.

15:09.865 --> 15:12.650
Deacon and I will search

15:15.131 --> 15:17.003
Guy just killed a cop.Hey.

15:17.046 --> 15:19.831
Stay focused. We still
got five Septimos

15:19.875 --> 15:20.876
on the loose.

15:30.059 --> 15:32.148
Wait a minute. Hold on a second.

15:32.192 --> 15:33.889
Hey, guys.
Check this out.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.238
What do you got?

15:39.764 --> 15:43.029
Right there. The tattoo
from El Diablo's video.

15:43.072 --> 15:44.508
Our suspect's got the same one.

15:51.776 --> 15:53.169
La Mano.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.482
[exhales]You said "La Mano,"

16:01.525 --> 16:03.745
as in...Manuel Reyes.

16:03.788 --> 16:06.008
El Diablo'spersonal bodyguard?

16:06.052 --> 16:09.577
That's right. And he is never
not by El Diablo's side.

16:09.620 --> 16:11.971
What are you saying?El Diablo is here?

16:12.797 --> 16:13.973
If La Mano was on that plane,

16:14.016 --> 16:15.322
El Diablo was, too.

16:16.410 --> 16:18.325
He's on U.S. soil.

16:25.636 --> 16:27.551
HICKS: Yeah. Roger that.
Rocker's squad

16:27.595 --> 16:28.552
arrested two more Septimos.

16:28.596 --> 16:30.076
He's sending photos.

16:30.119 --> 16:31.555
Three out of the sixare now in custody.

16:31.599 --> 16:33.035
Now, as far as we know,

16:33.079 --> 16:34.906
the remaining threehave not escaped the perimeter,

16:34.950 --> 16:37.518
including El Diablo.El Diablo coming here,risking capture

16:37.561 --> 16:39.781
by U.S. authorities,it's out of character.

16:39.824 --> 16:41.652
I'll let you ask him why
when we bring him in.

16:41.696 --> 16:43.654
Hold it. Got him.

16:43.698 --> 16:45.569
That's El Diablo with
the red striped jacket.

16:45.613 --> 16:46.701
HICKS:
Where's that location?

16:46.744 --> 16:48.529
77th Street seven
minutes ago.

16:48.572 --> 16:50.574
R-Commander to SWAT team,
patrol units.

16:50.618 --> 16:53.142
Suspects were last observed
crossing 77th Street.

16:53.186 --> 16:55.057
Heading north.
Sending descriptors now.

16:55.101 --> 16:56.493
Look how they're moving.

16:56.537 --> 16:58.060
The last three
guys regrouped.

16:58.104 --> 17:00.236
It's like they know this
area and have a plan.

17:00.280 --> 17:01.759
Yeah, they're heading
somewhere specific.

17:01.803 --> 17:03.587
Well, there's more thana few public use landing strips

17:03.631 --> 17:05.067
in the L.A. area.The Septimos

17:05.111 --> 17:06.329
use Baldwin Hillsbecause it's near

17:06.373 --> 17:07.504
one of their maindistribution hubs.

17:07.548 --> 17:08.940
Meaning El Diablo
could have

17:08.984 --> 17:10.768
an entire network
of allies close by.

17:10.812 --> 17:13.597
Who's the head of El Septimo's
distribution in South L.A.?

17:13.641 --> 17:15.730
Well, it used to be a guynamed Bernie Guzman,

17:15.773 --> 17:17.775
but he spent the last six monthsin California State Prison

17:17.819 --> 17:19.429
in Lancaster.
We're still gathering intel

17:19.473 --> 17:21.431
on who replaced him.You thinkwe could flip Bernie?

17:21.475 --> 17:23.042
DEA already tried. No dice.

17:23.085 --> 17:24.434
If we can figure out

17:24.478 --> 17:26.610
who El Diablo's new
L.A. connection is,

17:26.654 --> 17:28.960
maybe we can figure out where
he's going and get ahead of him

17:29.004 --> 17:30.571
in case he manages to
slip our perimeter.

17:30.614 --> 17:32.616
All right.

17:37.230 --> 17:39.971
Find him.

to be El Diablo's jacket.

17:48.284 --> 17:50.199
We're in an alley
between 67th and 68th.

17:50.243 --> 17:51.592
HICKS:
Airship-17,

17:51.635 --> 17:53.463

coming through here?

18:03.125 --> 18:05.127
Nah. I'm sorry.
I don't want to be involved.

18:05.171 --> 18:06.215
Hey, wait, wait, wait.If you saw anything,

18:06.259 --> 18:07.434

18:08.826 --> 18:10.045

18:10.089 --> 18:11.568
You need to talkto us right now.

All right, look,
I don't know if it's anything,

18:14.223 --> 18:15.703
but I did see somebody
come running through here

18:15.746 --> 18:17.008
a couple minutes ago. All right?

18:17.052 --> 18:18.836
He had a gun,so I waited him out,

18:18.880 --> 18:20.447
but I have no ideawhich way he went.

18:20.490 --> 18:22.710
Was he wearing this jacket?

18:22.753 --> 18:24.451
Yeah, I think so.

18:24.494 --> 18:26.148
That's it?That's it.

18:34.635 --> 18:36.332
matching El Diablo's
description.

18:36.376 --> 18:38.160
Sounds like El Diablo might haveditched his two friends

18:38.204 --> 18:39.422
to keep a low profile.

18:39.466 --> 18:40.684

22:18.380 --> 22:19.425
That's a negative.

22:19.468 --> 22:20.687

23:27.710 --> 23:29.190
Are you aware that

23:29.233 --> 23:31.497
Bernie is a member of
the cartel El Septimo?

23:31.540 --> 23:33.194
He's pretty high up, too.

23:33.237 --> 23:35.326
Sold El Septimo's dope

23:37.067 --> 23:39.200
happen to know who took over forhim after he went to prison?

23:39.243 --> 23:41.768
How would I know that?Yeah, I figured as much.

23:41.811 --> 23:44.161
Bernie hasn't told you anything.

23:44.205 --> 23:46.337
I'll probably have better luck
with the blonde he's sweet on.

23:46.381 --> 23:48.339
Wait.

23:48.383 --> 23:50.341

23:56.347 --> 23:58.349
You thought you were theonly one making conjugal visits

23:58.393 --> 23:59.873
to Bernie in Lancaster?

23:59.916 --> 24:02.223
I have an ID here

Bernie mention his name
a few times.

24:33.776 --> 24:35.038
Okay.

32:47.617 --> 32:49.358
Come on, man.
There's got to be something.

32:49.402 --> 32:51.273
A little more.

32:51.317 --> 32:52.971
Some reason you've come here

32:53.014 --> 32:54.929
after so long.
What do you want?

32:56.104 --> 32:58.367
I want you to remember.

32:58.411 --> 33:00.369
When it happens,

33:00.413 --> 33:02.241
when the citygoes up in flames...

33:03.807 --> 33:05.896
...remember I triedto stop it.

33:05.940 --> 33:07.594
When what happens?

33:09.378 --> 33:10.423
I'm clean.

33:11.380 --> 33:12.816
[gunshot]

33:12.860 --> 33:14.427
[woman cries loudly]

33:17.212 --> 33:19.301
[panting]

33:20.520 --> 33:23.088
Code 4.

33:23.131 --> 33:24.611
Suspect down.

33:24.654 --> 33:26.308
Hostage is safe.

33:34.577 --> 33:37.493
Simons and the DEA are gonna
interrogate the Septimos

33:37.537 --> 33:40.061
in custody and go through
El Diablo's burner phone,

33:40.105 --> 33:42.846
try to piece together
why he came stateside.Must have been

33:42.890 --> 33:45.197
something big to draw him outof hiding after all these years.

33:45.240 --> 33:48.548
What do you think he meant--
"Remember I tried to stop it"?

33:48.591 --> 33:50.028
Stop what?

33:50.071 --> 33:52.204
I'll shake some trees,
see what I hear.

33:52.247 --> 33:54.162
Do that.

33:54.206 --> 33:55.685
What's wrong?

33:55.729 --> 33:57.644
I don't know.

33:57.687 --> 34:00.821
I just got a feeling
this isn't over yet.

34:14.661 --> 34:16.141
Hey.

34:16.184 --> 34:17.664
How you doing?

34:17.707 --> 34:19.709
[helicopter whirring]

34:21.189 --> 34:24.497
You know, Gatens wanted
to be SWAT one day.

34:24.540 --> 34:26.542
Bet he would've made it, too.

34:30.416 --> 34:33.897
Maybe it's notmy place, but...

34:33.941 --> 34:36.987
I know today wasa really hard day for you.

34:37.031 --> 34:40.904
One that you... you mighthave trouble processing.

34:43.081 --> 34:45.822
We have a doctor at SWAT--

34:45.866 --> 34:48.347
Dr. Wendy Hughes--and she's-she's good.

34:51.350 --> 34:52.873
Maybe when the time is right,

34:52.916 --> 34:55.528
you-you might considertalking to her about all this.

34:55.571 --> 34:58.052
Appreciate it,

34:58.096 --> 35:00.446
but I'll figure
it out on my own.

35:01.534 --> 35:03.101
Sound like me.

35:04.406 --> 35:07.583
I tend to buryall my feelings.

35:10.064 --> 35:14.112
Until recently, they, uh...they all caught up.

35:16.592 --> 35:19.029
And I talked to her, and...

35:21.119 --> 35:23.773
I don't know. Might help.

35:24.774 --> 35:27.125
Really?

35:30.780 --> 35:32.739
I'll think about it.

35:32.782 --> 35:34.262
Thanks.

35:34.306 --> 35:36.656
I'm so sorry.

35:43.097 --> 35:45.491
[garbled radio transmission]

35:45.534 --> 35:47.319
Rough day.

35:47.362 --> 35:49.059
Yeah, rough
damnday, man.

35:49.103 --> 35:50.757
You sureyou missed all this?

35:50.800 --> 35:52.237
Yeah.

35:52.280 --> 35:54.413
Missed you guys a lot.

36:11.604 --> 36:13.040
Hey.Hey.

36:13.083 --> 36:14.433
Did you speak
to them already?

36:14.476 --> 36:15.869
I was just about to.

36:15.912 --> 36:17.262
I'll do it.

36:17.305 --> 36:19.046
I didn't meanto pressure you yesterday.

36:19.089 --> 36:22.092
I know. I want to.You sure?

36:22.136 --> 36:24.530
You said it could make a
difference coming from me.

36:24.573 --> 36:26.096
You really believe that?

36:26.140 --> 36:29.012
I do.Then, yeah, I'm sure.

36:33.495 --> 36:35.584
DEACON:
Now I'm sure you have a dozen

36:35.628 --> 36:38.239
questions about SWAT,
and I'll be happy

36:38.283 --> 36:41.242
to talk tactics and training
in just a minute.

36:41.286 --> 36:44.593
But first, I want to talk aboutsomething else, something I wish

36:44.637 --> 36:46.073
I'd paid a little
bit more attention to

36:46.116 --> 36:48.293
when I was
in the Academy.

36:48.336 --> 36:50.947
In this job,

36:50.991 --> 36:53.907
you are going to see things
you wish you wouldn't.

36:53.950 --> 36:56.605
You're gonna feel things
you wish you hadn't.

36:59.217 --> 37:01.697
For a long time, I, uh...

37:03.221 --> 37:06.267
I ran away from...

37:06.311 --> 37:08.356
getting any kind of help.

37:11.403 --> 37:14.841
But now that I am open to it,

37:14.884 --> 37:16.973
the hope is that's it's...

37:17.017 --> 37:19.062
it's gonna make me
a better officer.

37:20.673 --> 37:24.329
Better husband, better father.

37:26.200 --> 37:28.376
So if you ever feel
yourself struggling,

37:28.420 --> 37:30.378
just know,

37:30.422 --> 37:33.076
the LAPD will have your back.

37:34.556 --> 37:36.558
Certainly has mine.

37:42.869 --> 37:45.219
DEACON:Good night, Hondo.

37:55.360 --> 37:57.362
[line ringing]

37:58.885 --> 38:00.408
NICHELLE:
Hey.

38:00.452 --> 38:02.454
Hey.

38:03.803 --> 38:05.805
Thanks for picking up.

38:07.241 --> 38:09.243
Sybil told me
you stopped by yesterday.

38:09.287 --> 38:12.202
I did. I did. I...

38:12.246 --> 38:15.162
The changes look like they're
gonna be amazing. [laughs]

38:15.205 --> 38:17.338
Thanks.

38:17.382 --> 38:19.297
I hear
you're quite the traveler now.

38:19.340 --> 38:22.474
Yeah, well, that donation comeswith a lot of responsibility.

38:22.517 --> 38:24.389
I'm trying
to do right by these kids.

38:24.432 --> 38:26.956
Oh, come on. Come on.
I know you will.

38:29.002 --> 38:31.091
Look, um...

38:31.134 --> 38:35.051
I was hoping to tell you this
in person, but...

38:37.140 --> 38:38.881
Nichelle, I am so sorry

38:38.925 --> 38:41.710
about the way I handled things
the last time I saw you.

38:41.754 --> 38:44.583
That's not how I want to be.

38:44.626 --> 38:47.107
And I know I upset you.

38:47.150 --> 38:50.066
I'm not upset, Hondo.

38:50.110 --> 38:52.242
It just clarified things.

38:54.593 --> 38:56.899
You sound so far away right now.

38:56.943 --> 38:58.945
That's because I am.

38:58.988 --> 39:01.208
We're in different places.

39:01.251 --> 39:03.210
We want different things.

39:03.253 --> 39:07.475
It's not a crime.
It's just... sad.

39:07.519 --> 39:09.912
[rolling thunder]

39:09.956 --> 39:12.785
I really am trying
to be someone different.

39:12.828 --> 39:14.917
I hope you get there.

39:14.961 --> 39:18.268
But for now, my focus has
to be on something else.

39:18.312 --> 39:20.140
[Nichelle sighs]

39:20.183 --> 39:21.620
Listen, I have to go.

39:21.663 --> 39:23.970
I've got people here
waiting to talk to me.

39:24.013 --> 39:26.407
Okay.

39:26.451 --> 39:27.756
Okay.

39:27.800 --> 39:29.976
Bye.

39:47.123 --> 39:48.821
Got a nice bruise?

39:48.864 --> 39:51.127
Badge of honor.

39:51.171 --> 39:52.302
Damn right.

39:55.480 --> 39:57.133
Tell me something.[inhales sharply]

39:57.177 --> 39:58.613
In this job,

39:58.657 --> 40:02.008
we get shot at,
we get injured.

40:03.313 --> 40:04.619
Come face-to-face

40:04.663 --> 40:07.622
with cartel bosses
and their hit men.

40:07.666 --> 40:10.190
Are we crazy
for signing up for this?

40:11.887 --> 40:14.150
Yeah, probably.

40:14.194 --> 40:17.806
Almost every SWAT opwould be the scariest day

40:17.850 --> 40:19.591
of most people's lives.

40:19.634 --> 40:21.593
We're not most
people. You and me--

40:21.636 --> 40:24.291
we already experienced our
worst day when we were kids.

40:24.334 --> 40:26.206
Can't argue that.

40:27.207 --> 40:29.818
Probably what led us here.

40:29.862 --> 40:32.691
Always trying
to save the next kid.

40:33.735 --> 40:35.737
Yeah.

40:36.825 --> 40:38.523
Sometimes I wonder, though.

40:40.046 --> 40:43.353
If my life
would have been better

40:43.397 --> 40:46.661
if I'd had normal parents,

40:46.705 --> 40:48.707
normal childhood.

40:48.750 --> 40:52.711
Maybe, but then
you would have never met me.

40:57.411 --> 40:59.544
Well, that's one wayof looking at it.

41:03.548 --> 41:05.898
[rhythmic vocalizing]

41:10.119 --> 41:13.732
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

41:16.082 --> 41:18.476
Thought you left.

41:18.519 --> 41:21.261
I guess I wasn't readyto go home just yet.

41:21.304 --> 41:23.524
You good?

41:23.568 --> 41:25.526
[panting]

41:25.570 --> 41:27.659
I'm trying.

41:27.702 --> 41:29.791
Okay.

41:29.835 --> 41:32.272
Save something for tomorrow.

41:32.315 --> 41:35.057
I always do.

41:35.101 --> 41:37.103
Good night.

41:39.279 --> 41:41.760
