WEBVTT

00:05.169 --> 00:06.861
Previously on ER...

00:07.007 --> 00:09.393
So you quit your job and get
married in the same week?

00:09.478 --> 00:10.910
I'm a new guy now.

00:10.933 --> 00:14.040
Maybe some of that love will
rub off on all of us here

00:14.226 --> 00:17.304
and help us find someone
as special as you two have.

00:20.813 --> 00:23.888
I got them the honeymoon suite
at the Ritz for a few nights, but...

00:24.096 --> 00:26.608
they say they can't use it on
account of Joe and everything.

00:26.617 --> 00:28.085
Oh, it's go time.

00:28.627 --> 00:30.181
You're a real prick, you know that?

00:31.577 --> 00:33.010
Stop it!
Tony!

00:33.074 --> 00:34.573
I don't love you.

00:35.307 --> 00:36.413
So that's it?

00:37.574 --> 00:38.932
- We're done?
- Yeah.

00:39.439 --> 00:41.621
Because Ray couldn't get over you?

00:48.358 --> 00:50.671
Have you seen my other sock?
I just bought these.

00:50.847 --> 00:52.933
Nobody wears socks in Hawaii.

00:53.967 --> 00:58.532
- Ugh, I can't believe it's almost 9:00.
- I can't believe Joe's still asleep.

00:59.186 --> 01:01.630
Couldn't find anyone
to cover your shift for today?

01:01.657 --> 01:05.061
No, that's the problem with surprise
weddings. It's hard to plan.

01:07.285 --> 01:08.973
I'll stop by later.

01:09.686 --> 01:12.073
I have to tie up loose ends
with Anspaugh.

01:12.908 --> 01:15.983
- You've got to be kidding me.
- What?

01:17.585 --> 01:21.821
Married five days and I'm already getting
mail addressed to Mrs. Luka Kovac.

01:21.856 --> 01:23.052
Nice.

01:24.365 --> 01:27.462
You know, being married isn't gonna
change the fact that I don't cook...

01:27.725 --> 01:32.022
- or sew... or keep track of your socks.
- Okay.

01:32.048 --> 01:36.753
That's fine in Chicago,
but on our honeymoon...

01:36.928 --> 01:40.600
you're going to be serving me
Martinis wearing only this.

01:41.406 --> 01:43.330
Got me a bikini.

01:43.767 --> 01:47.260
I'm a liberated modern husband.

01:49.935 --> 01:51.830
I like to shop.

02:00.108 --> 02:02.740
Abby and Luka are crazy.
Who turns down

02:02.835 --> 02:06.542
three free nights in the honeymoon
suite at the Ritz? Hope?

02:11.158 --> 02:13.523
Oh, my... Oh...

02:15.198 --> 02:20.042
You know, when I was eight, I found
this book in my parents' bedroom,

02:20.285 --> 02:24.603
Sex and the Christian Marriage.
And the very first page, it said,

02:24.636 --> 02:27.623
"Orgasms bring a couple closer to God."

02:27.797 --> 02:31.443
So that night at the dinner table,
I asked my parents what an orgasm was.

02:31.686 --> 02:32.893
What'd they say?

02:33.495 --> 02:38.242
An orgasm is a very special kind of prayer.
Which is fine and actually kind of sweet,

02:38.276 --> 02:42.180
but, like, later that week, I had my first
sleepover at a friend's house.

02:42.216 --> 02:45.450
So her mom asks me what my bedtime
routine is and I said,

02:46.108 --> 02:49.733
- "bath, toothbrushing, orgasm, sleep."
- You did not.

02:49.808 --> 02:53.122
I did. I was never invited back.

02:54.986 --> 02:58.703
- Champagne? It's 8:00 in the morning.
- I have no sense of time in this place.

02:58.735 --> 03:00.921
Arch, you got to be at work in,
like, an hour.

03:01.095 --> 03:02.602
- Dirty word.
- What is?

03:02.615 --> 03:04.022
- Work.
- Oh.

03:04.946 --> 03:07.230
Well, I don't have to be
in till 4:00, so...

03:07.278 --> 03:09.863
you go ahead and then
I'll check us out of the room.

03:10.087 --> 03:13.932
No. No, no, no.
We're staying another night.

03:14.076 --> 03:17.780
- Another three nights.
- What? That's crazy.

03:17.996 --> 03:21.080
This room must be like
a thousand dollars a night.

03:21.388 --> 03:23.050
They comped us.

03:24.566 --> 03:26.013
Why would they do that?

03:26.476 --> 03:30.160
I guess we're spending so much on room
service, we made it worth their while.

03:30.355 --> 03:34.991
- Now... mimosa?
- Nimosa.

03:44.775 --> 03:45.922
Damn it.

03:46.205 --> 03:48.632
Hey, hey, Betina, hey.
Hold up.

03:50.386 --> 03:52.150
All right, all right, look, look.

03:53.276 --> 03:55.811
I got it now.
I figured you out.

03:56.056 --> 03:57.341
Figured me out?

03:57.546 --> 03:59.402
You've had it with the guys
who are trying to be cool

03:59.416 --> 04:01.072
and you're ready for someone real.

04:01.256 --> 04:03.051
Got someone you want
to set me up with?

04:03.105 --> 04:05.680
Come on now, help me out, okay?
I've seen the light.

04:05.775 --> 04:08.773
Or maybe you're just saying what you
think I need to hear to go out with you?

04:08.806 --> 04:11.613
Oh, it's not like that.
Really. Really.

04:12.186 --> 04:14.650
Greg... I like you.

04:14.796 --> 04:17.470
But I have been dating
guys like you for years.

04:17.505 --> 04:20.822
You will do whatever it takes
to get the girl, but in the end,

04:20.976 --> 04:22.591
it's just about the chase.

04:22.987 --> 04:25.803
Betina, I'm not like that anymore.

04:26.976 --> 04:28.173
I've changed.

04:29.795 --> 04:32.632
This is it?
They closed the ER for a paint job?

04:32.837 --> 04:36.082
Well, it's only been a few days.
You can't expect a drastic change overnight.

04:36.267 --> 04:38.381
Mine point exactly, Dr. Pratt.

04:38.577 --> 04:40.820
See you later.
I've got radiology rounds in the ICU.

04:40.845 --> 04:41.812
- Wait!
- Pratt...

04:41.837 --> 04:45.281
- I got a hypotensive patient here, 87/45.
- All right, what's the baseline?

04:45.317 --> 04:48.843
- She runs low. Always has.
- Why is it that you know that an I don't?

04:48.876 --> 04:52.571
- She's febrile, too, 103.
- Okay, any vomiting, any coughing?

04:52.618 --> 04:55.981
Just a little belly pain. I could see
my doctor tomorrow when I get home.

04:56.005 --> 04:57.102
- Where's home?
- Boston.

04:57.178 --> 05:00.260
- We're here for her physics conference.
- I'm gonna cut his eyes out

05:00.306 --> 05:02.871
- and send him home in a box!
- Need some help here!

05:02.917 --> 05:06.431
Sam, liter of saline, find her a monitored
bed, and I'll be in as soon as I can.

05:06.466 --> 05:07.923
Can't you just give me an antibiotic?

05:07.945 --> 05:10.173
We've been waiting in triage
nearly three hours.

05:10.197 --> 05:11.832
I know, I'm sorry,
that's the way it goes around here.

05:11.855 --> 05:14.662
You know what, let me see if there's
an open bed. I'll be right back.

05:15.806 --> 05:19.893
Sam... meet my parents, Barb and Len.
They're visiting from Long Island.

05:19.918 --> 05:22.883
- Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hey, Weston, come on, man, you're up.

05:22.918 --> 05:25.202
- This guy needs a chest tube.
- I'll find you guys later.

05:26.726 --> 05:29.582
Well, you must be very proud of Larry.
Have a good tour.

05:30.038 --> 05:32.392
You're even prettier
than he said you were.

05:32.968 --> 05:35.893
We're so happy
he finally found a girlfriend.

05:45.547 --> 05:48.651
- Let me out of here, you bastard!
- Where had they move the ortho stuff?

05:48.698 --> 05:50.973
I'm sorry for springing
my parents on you like that.

05:51.008 --> 05:53.210
I am not your girlfriend, Larry,
you know that, right?

05:53.248 --> 05:54.720
Oh, come on.

05:55.636 --> 05:56.902
Sam...

05:58.806 --> 06:01.342
We made out... at a wedding.

06:01.568 --> 06:04.251
That's what drunk single people
do at weddings.

06:04.447 --> 06:05.772
Doesn't mean we're an item.

06:06.218 --> 06:08.881
Well, I'm not the type
to take sex casually, Sam.

06:09.055 --> 06:10.741
We did not have sex.

06:10.937 --> 06:14.361
- Depends on how you define sex.
- Larry, we did not have sex.

06:14.595 --> 06:16.082
Outercourse doesn't count?

06:16.105 --> 06:17.950
- Oh, my God.
- What?

06:18.865 --> 06:20.960
- Ace or splint?
- Ace is cool.

06:21.007 --> 06:24.310
So where are all the so-called improvements
you guys did while you were closed?

06:24.405 --> 06:26.532
Oh, what, you didn't see
the new admit desk?

06:26.568 --> 06:30.031
Or how about our electrical outlets?
They are a new shade of red.

06:30.548 --> 06:33.280
All right. How did you hurt your ankle?

06:33.308 --> 06:35.650
Running all over the hospital
with Dr. Moretti.

06:35.708 --> 06:36.562
Who?

06:36.757 --> 06:39.471
Dr. Moretti.
He's head of the ICU.

06:39.745 --> 06:42.282
- I'm doing a month up there with him.
- Wiggle your toes.

06:42.908 --> 06:45.011
I'm wearing a pager for
the Rapid Response team.

06:45.215 --> 06:47.440
- The what?
- It's Moretti's latest invention.

06:47.477 --> 06:50.703
When nurses get a bad feeling about
the patients, they call us and we run.

06:50.806 --> 06:54.570
- Like a code team.
- More like a pre-code team.

06:55.158 --> 06:57.951
Why don't you let me have the docs
take a look at your ankle just to be sure?

06:58.206 --> 07:00.703
- As long as it's not Ray.
- Yeah, you got it.

07:02.838 --> 07:06.173
Okay, Morris... you finally
close the deal with Hope or not?

07:06.207 --> 07:11.053
Hey, all I can say... this is the first
time I left our hotel room in three days.

07:11.588 --> 07:15.551
Mostly we're just praying.
Lot of special prayers, huh?

07:16.006 --> 07:18.712
Hey, what about you and
our favorite radiologist?

07:18.777 --> 07:20.732
Come on, you got to respect
a woman's privacy, right?

07:20.778 --> 07:23.190
- You sly dog.
- Anybody seen Ray around?

07:23.215 --> 07:24.431
No. He's a couple hours late.

07:24.447 --> 07:27.402
He's probably still hung over from the
wedding. He was in pretty bad shape.

07:27.417 --> 07:31.722
- And, Sam, whoo, baby, wild night, huh?
- Please shut up.

07:32.126 --> 07:34.582
Katey Alvaro's in curtain two.
She twisted her ankle.

07:34.615 --> 07:39.272
- Doesn't look broken, but... take a look.
- I'm on it. Larry?

07:39.577 --> 07:41.160
I'm gonna kill him.

07:41.688 --> 07:44.772
Hey, anybody see our physicist
in curtain three?

07:44.805 --> 07:47.373
Yeah, I got to slow down in SVT,
but she's next for sure.

07:47.478 --> 07:49.550
Excuse me,
we're still waiting for a doctor.

07:49.574 --> 07:51.823
I'm sorry, we're really busy.

07:52.027 --> 07:54.773
- How are you feeling?
- Run down.

07:55.304 --> 07:58.612
I've been working my ass off for the last
six months prepping for this conference.

07:58.649 --> 08:01.510
Six months? Try 20 years.

08:01.696 --> 08:05.170
You've been working on quantum
processing your entire career.

08:05.975 --> 08:08.041
- Quantum processing?
- Oh, theory...

08:08.115 --> 08:12.240
in physics which says that an atom
can exist in two places at the same time

08:12.298 --> 08:14.750
and I showed that it can work
in a larger matrix.

08:14.916 --> 08:17.623
I have no idea what you just said,
but it sounds impressive.

08:17.676 --> 08:20.462
It pretty much blew
the lid off the entire field.

08:20.647 --> 08:22.960
Well, I think what
you've got is probably viral,

08:23.148 --> 08:25.601
but I'm going to send
some blood tests to be safe.

08:26.215 --> 08:29.800
Sam, we're gonna do dinner
at 8:00 at Osteria Angelo.

08:30.066 --> 08:32.221
Great! Have a good time.

08:36.476 --> 08:39.191
Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't mean
to sound like uptight mainlander,

08:39.226 --> 08:43.160
but I find it hard to believe that you
can't rent a car with a car seat in it.

08:43.807 --> 08:44.833
Okay.

08:45.535 --> 08:48.303
Right, we'll bring our own.
Yes, mahalo for nothing.

08:48.518 --> 08:52.083
Sophia Van Brummellen, 35,
fell down a 15-foot flight of stairs.

08:52.117 --> 08:53.602
I'm Dr. Morris.
Can you tell me your name?

08:53.618 --> 08:55.612
- I'm gonna be sick.
- Okay, roll her on her side.

08:55.637 --> 08:58.331
- Please be okay. Let her be okay.
- Abby, need some help here.

08:58.345 --> 09:00.711
- Um, hello.
- What happened?

09:00.746 --> 09:02.803
- She fell down stairs...
- I want to hear it from her.

09:02.878 --> 09:06.170
She slipped and she fell down--
her head was bouncing down the stairs;

09:06.258 --> 09:09.300
when she got to the bottom,
she wasn't moving and she wasn't talking.

09:09.318 --> 09:11.562
I'm Dr. Lockhart,
any medications or allergies?

09:11.578 --> 09:13.222
- No, she's healthy.
- My...

09:13.276 --> 09:14.123
Okay, hang in there,

09:14.137 --> 09:15.673
- we're going to take care of you.
- What's her access?

09:15.687 --> 09:17.833
- 18 gauge in the right antecube.
- She's seizing.

09:17.937 --> 09:20.212
Ativan, two migs,
let's get Trauma down here.

09:20.278 --> 09:23.083
I need a second line
and 50 of Manninol right away.

09:23.277 --> 09:26.913
We've got a dilated stomach with
exaggerated incisura. Call Ultrasound.

09:27.116 --> 09:27.911
Why?

09:27.947 --> 09:30.200
Caterpillar sign;
could be pyloric stenosis.

09:30.387 --> 09:33.400
Pratt, I need an antibiotics order
for our physicist in Three.

09:33.526 --> 09:36.182
Micro called, she's got gram
positive cocci on the stain.

09:36.277 --> 09:38.970
That's probably just contaminated,
she looks too good to be septic.

09:39.036 --> 09:41.702
She's still febrile and tachy,
and how would you know how she looks?

09:41.735 --> 09:43.560
You haven't seen her since
we brought her back an hour ago.

09:43.578 --> 09:46.543
I've got an obstructed newborn,
a perfed ulcer on his sixth unit of blood,

09:46.576 --> 09:49.312
and my aphasic boxer
just dropped his pressure in CT.

09:49.428 --> 09:52.821
Give her two grams of Ceftriaxone
and I'll see her as soon as I can, okay?

09:53.127 --> 09:56.203
Guess what? I'll be house-sitting
for Luby while they're away.

09:56.565 --> 09:58.871
- Luby?
- Luka and Abby.

09:59.108 --> 10:01.963
You know, like Brangelina,
Bennifer, Tomkat.

10:02.016 --> 10:05.030
I hear it's a nice place, and Abby
says it's okay if you sleep over.

10:05.076 --> 10:07.010
What? Are you for real?

10:07.046 --> 10:11.240
I didn't think it would be right to have
sex in their bed without at least asking.

10:12.276 --> 10:14.792
- Load with a gram of Dilantin.
- What is that?

10:14.876 --> 10:16.763
A medicine to keep her
from seizing again.

10:16.778 --> 10:19.512
If you want to be here, you're going
to have to step back. More suction.

10:19.558 --> 10:21.842
It's cranked all the way up.
Nothing's coming out.

10:21.877 --> 10:23.890
- Come on, Gates.
- I'm trying, I can't see crap.

10:23.906 --> 10:25.582
- Sat's are down to 86.
- Is that bad?

10:25.617 --> 10:28.112
- Abby, switch with Gates.
- I haven't even tried yet.

10:28.138 --> 10:30.273
- Exactly.
- I'm being blamed for equipment failure?

10:30.307 --> 10:32.273
Don't make this about you, please.

10:33.256 --> 10:35.781
- What are you doing?
- The tube will protect her airway

10:35.807 --> 10:38.292
- and allow us to breathe for her.
- Is he still mad about the Propofol?

10:38.316 --> 10:40.443
Yeah, that or the thing
that happened at the wedding.

10:40.476 --> 10:43.791
- What happened at the wedding?
- Nothing. Yeah, it's the propofol.

10:43.946 --> 10:45.203
Wants me to kiss the ring.

10:45.277 --> 10:47.412
Why don't you just apologize
and get it over with?

10:47.437 --> 10:49.192
'Cause I have nothing to apologize for.

10:50.685 --> 10:54.412
Post-op morbidity and mortality are
up seven percent this year.

10:54.456 --> 10:56.462
- Really? Why?
- I don't know, but I'm going to find out.

10:56.508 --> 10:58.833
I'm conducting an internal audit
into the post-op unit.

10:58.878 --> 11:02.130
I want every med, every hiccup
meticulously recorded.

11:02.177 --> 11:05.113
- Nurses are going to hate you.
- No, they're going to hate you.

11:05.207 --> 11:08.482
You're in charge of the investigation.
ER Trauma call.

11:08.518 --> 11:10.801
Not you, Dusty.
I want you hands-on at the PACU unit.

11:10.825 --> 11:13.212
You're not doing consults
till the audit's over.

11:13.247 --> 11:14.853
Oh, boo.

11:29.977 --> 11:31.211
Surgery's here.
What do you got?

11:31.237 --> 11:33.873
A 35-year-old fell down a flight of stairs.

11:33.977 --> 11:36.761
Head trauma, intubated,
FAST negative, labs pending.

11:36.807 --> 11:39.763
Came in altered,
five-centimeter scalp lac.

11:40.135 --> 11:41.202
Access?

11:41.278 --> 11:45.393
18-gauge times two.
First crit 37, second one cooking.

11:45.618 --> 11:47.422
- Want me to bag for you?
- No, I got it.

11:47.448 --> 11:50.253
- Bolus is done.
- Hey, Run D five half at 75 an hour.

11:50.278 --> 11:52.852
You don't want a fluid overload till
we know what's going on in her head.

11:52.876 --> 11:55.381
- It was a nice wedding.
- Thanks.

11:56.485 --> 11:58.093
Sorry I got so crazy.

11:58.127 --> 12:01.613
I think because I knew I was leaving.
I let it all hang out.

12:02.195 --> 12:05.802
I mean, you hardly even know me,
and then I had to go and be like that.

12:07.188 --> 12:08.240
Don't worry about it.

12:08.715 --> 12:12.491
- Dr. Morris, your TPA patient is seizing.
- I'm busy here. Find Pratt.

12:12.536 --> 12:14.173
Don't worry about it. I got it. Go.

12:14.378 --> 12:16.440
Mae Lee, call CT.
Tell 'em we're coming up.

12:16.845 --> 12:19.792
- Is there a Megan Strand here?
- That's me.

12:20.388 --> 12:22.762
Neighbors heard screaming
in your house this morning.

12:23.056 --> 12:24.842
We were having an argument.

12:28.318 --> 12:30.940
Where the hell is my Ceftriaxone?

12:31.636 --> 12:32.891
No, it's Pratt.

12:33.268 --> 12:35.083
P-R-A-T-T.

12:35.738 --> 12:37.511
Hell, no, I'm not new!
Are you?

12:37.626 --> 12:39.292
Listen, just send
the stuff down, all right?

12:39.317 --> 12:41.391
I ordered the antibiotics
over an hour ago.

12:41.578 --> 12:43.992
Learned helplessness
is pervasive in the ER.

12:44.017 --> 12:47.213
Can't have a home-schooled
pharmacy tech wag the dog.

12:49.635 --> 12:51.053
You rang?

12:51.198 --> 12:52.823
What's going on? Who are you?

12:52.876 --> 12:56.100
I'm Dr. Kevin Moretti.
I'm the clinical director of the ICU.

12:56.138 --> 12:58.880
They called me down here 'cause
your wife's condition is deteriorating.

12:58.906 --> 13:00.660
- Talk to me.
- Fever to 103.

13:00.678 --> 13:03.940
- Stain showed gram positive cocci.
- Yeah, we thought it was a contaminant.

13:03.975 --> 13:07.031
Which is stupid.
Katey, set up for a subclavian,

13:07.078 --> 13:11.531
prime the line and get a CVP monitor.
Draw a lactate now, you, and, uh,

13:11.577 --> 13:14.513
give me six units of packed blood cells
standing by in the blood bank.

13:14.837 --> 13:16.701
- Who was the attending on this case?
- Me.

13:16.727 --> 13:19.100
Really?
Well, you dropped the ball, didn't you?

13:19.337 --> 13:21.282
- Excuse me?
- She's septic.

13:21.315 --> 13:23.201
It's obvious.
You should have anticipated this.

13:23.217 --> 13:25.361
She's young, she's healthy.
She had no reason...

13:25.377 --> 13:27.212
She doesn't need a reason.

13:28.048 --> 13:30.363
A reason.
Breathe, please.

13:30.735 --> 13:34.421
Katey, do you see any signs
of impending shock here?

13:34.628 --> 13:37.762
Tachycardia out of proportion with
the fever, widening pulse pressure.

13:37.986 --> 13:41.531
See that? Even a medical student
could see it coming from a mile away.

13:41.548 --> 13:43.173
Must be some new-attending thing.

13:43.206 --> 13:44.982
We'll take care of your wife, sir.
Don't worry about it.

13:45.018 --> 13:47.051
- I can manage my own patients, thank you.
- Really?

13:47.107 --> 13:50.363
Then why did one of your nurses
activate my team? Excuse me.

13:50.918 --> 13:53.340
I knew you were getting slammed.
She needed attention.

13:53.558 --> 13:56.043
The Rapid Response team
doesn't even cover the ER!

13:56.108 --> 13:59.733
Well, if you can't handle slam dunk
cases like this, maybe we should.

13:59.975 --> 14:02.180
Give me one percent lido. Let's go.

14:02.956 --> 14:04.941
Explain this again.
I don't understand.

14:04.978 --> 14:06.982
- My wife is healthy.
- All right, calm down, sir. Look,

14:07.016 --> 14:09.053
the bacteria could have seeded
the bloodstream through the lungs,

14:09.108 --> 14:11.712
- a cut in the skin, her intestines.
- Second liter's in.

14:12.676 --> 14:15.553
Goal-directed resuscitation
for septic shock

14:15.705 --> 14:18.573
is so easy,
yet so difficult for you ED types.

14:18.597 --> 14:20.933
- She's in shock?
- Systolic's only 82.

14:21.018 --> 14:22.323
That would be a yes.

14:22.358 --> 14:24.641
The key is to preserve
effective tissue perfusion

14:24.677 --> 14:27.531
while avoiding excessive
myocardial oxygen consumption.

14:27.576 --> 14:31.090
Translation-- get oxygen to the body
without stressing the heart.

14:31.117 --> 14:35.121
We need CVP monitoring and continuous
central venous sats to keep track of that.

14:35.147 --> 14:37.143
See that?
He's learning already.

14:37.386 --> 14:41.163
That requires ICU-level monitoring. We're
too busy down here. We can't do that.

14:41.335 --> 14:44.271
Really? You can't?
You can, and you will.

14:44.307 --> 14:46.531
- Watch.
- We don't have the nursing capacity.

14:46.575 --> 14:50.150
Patients come in, we stabilize them,
then we send them up. That's how it works.

14:50.188 --> 14:53.870
Yeah? You forget about that eight
hours that they sit around in triage.

14:53.908 --> 14:58.260
- And wait another five to get a bed.
- Look, it's not great, but it's the reality.

14:58.307 --> 15:01.190
Reality is nothing more
than a persistent illusion.

15:01.215 --> 15:04.323
Einstein said that.
I'm a physicist.

15:04.338 --> 15:06.521
Memorized everything that guy ever wrote.

15:06.545 --> 15:09.161
See that? Even more reason
not to sit around and let your

15:09.186 --> 15:12.921
- organs rot away like rancid meat.
- Nobody's organs are rotting.

15:12.945 --> 15:15.502
Free air under the diaphragm.
Probably a perfed diverticulum.

15:15.528 --> 15:17.723
- What's that mean?
- Um, what that means is,

15:17.746 --> 15:20.251
an infection in your intestines
has eroded through the wall.

15:20.278 --> 15:22.333
We need to get in there,
clean up and repair the hole.

15:22.425 --> 15:25.411
Lucien, don't you tired
of ER docs waiting around

15:25.436 --> 15:27.932
for the surgeons to come down
and save the day?

15:28.006 --> 15:29.800
Give 'em a break, Kevin.
You know what it's like down here.

15:29.835 --> 15:31.662
I'm going to call the OR,
tell them we're bringing her up.

15:31.677 --> 15:36.882
It's true-- I know that we're just monkeys
on a minor planet on an average star, but...

15:36.907 --> 15:40.010
let's not pretend
that sepsis is beyond our reach.

15:40.038 --> 15:43.772
If you're trying to quote Hawking,
you mangled it.

15:43.998 --> 15:46.360
- I think I'm in love.
- Alison! What are you doing here, Blake?

15:46.416 --> 15:48.110
Hey, look, she called me, all right?

15:48.137 --> 15:50.513
- Hey, whoa, guys, hey!
- You don't get to do this!

15:50.557 --> 15:52.570
- Hey, hey, come on.
- She wants me here, okay?

15:52.605 --> 15:53.632
Take it easy, all right?

15:55.078 --> 15:57.392
Stay away from my wife!

16:02.307 --> 16:03.863
- Where are you taking her?
- CT scan.

16:04.257 --> 16:05.373
- Can I go, too?
- No, no, no.

16:05.386 --> 16:08.121
Why don't you stay here?
Dr. Gates will be with her the whole time.

16:08.886 --> 16:10.222
Is everything okay?

16:11.217 --> 16:13.422
No, my girlfriend's in a coma.

16:13.645 --> 16:16.390
It's all my fault, so, no,
everything is not okay.

16:16.847 --> 16:18.743
All your fault? How is that?

16:19.676 --> 16:22.273
I left my roller blades
at the top of the stairs.

16:22.377 --> 16:24.862
It's polished concrete.
It's very slippery.

16:25.085 --> 16:27.082
We were fighting, and she tripped.

16:28.325 --> 16:30.001
Well, did you explain
to the cops what happened?

16:30.038 --> 16:31.751
- I'm sure they'll sort it out.
- Yeah.

16:33.198 --> 16:35.402
No, it's been a bad year.

16:36.018 --> 16:37.432
How so?

16:39.165 --> 16:42.703
Moved to Chicago
five months ago for my job.

16:43.498 --> 16:46.702
Ever since,
we've been fighting constantly.

16:46.986 --> 16:51.723
These huge, dish-breaking fights.
And we never used to do that.

16:52.007 --> 16:55.662
You know?
It's like the city's changed her.

16:56.698 --> 16:59.190
Well, transitions are hard.

17:01.506 --> 17:03.793
Been together ever since college.

17:04.006 --> 17:05.593
Been through a lot.

17:06.056 --> 17:11.142
You know, us coming out to her family,
and her brother dying.

17:13.107 --> 17:15.301
You think you can make it through
that kind of stuff,

17:15.337 --> 17:17.652
you think you can make it
through anything.

17:21.066 --> 17:27.582
Who knew, after 15 years,
and everything would turn so much?

17:29.527 --> 17:31.020
It's scary.

17:33.627 --> 17:34.983
Yeah.

17:36.008 --> 17:39.472
Quantum information processing,
teleportation.

17:39.575 --> 17:42.412
You know, we've been chasing
the same questions since grad school.

17:42.537 --> 17:44.302
I'm sorry if he feels threatened by it,

17:44.335 --> 17:46.743
but there are certain conversations
she can only have with me.

17:46.775 --> 17:49.532
- Vice versa.
- But it's only work, right?

17:49.606 --> 17:52.180
Yeah, we're both married.
Happily married.

17:53.236 --> 17:56.000
Can't say that the idea has
never crossed my mind, but...

17:56.026 --> 17:58.843
Alison and I just really click.
I don't know anybody else, male or female,

17:58.875 --> 18:01.100
who challenges me like she does.

18:02.958 --> 18:05.043
They have this thing.

18:05.508 --> 18:07.652
They're together in the lab
all day, and then

18:07.677 --> 18:11.813
she gets home, and everything's,
"Blake said this, Blake did that."

18:12.057 --> 18:14.243
Something about it has always felt weird.

18:14.466 --> 18:16.262
He's her work husband.

18:17.338 --> 18:20.022
Yeah, people spend more time
at work than they do at home.

18:20.107 --> 18:23.941
Share experiences,
develop a verbal shorthand.

18:24.717 --> 18:26.770
Of course, some intimacy develops.

18:27.067 --> 18:29.922
The two men in my life--
they don't get each other.

18:29.956 --> 18:31.593
Really?
Never would have noticed that.

18:31.618 --> 18:33.333
- The OR's ready.
- Okay.

18:33.995 --> 18:36.382
Two planets revolving
around the same sun.

18:36.818 --> 18:38.340
Collision is inevitable, right?

18:38.376 --> 18:40.750
They try to stay out of each
other's orbits to keep the...

18:40.808 --> 18:45.021
solar system in order, but...
it's a useless exercise.

18:45.106 --> 18:47.393
- Disorder rules.
- Oh, yeah.

18:47.615 --> 18:50.403
The universe always
reverts to equilibrium.

18:51.347 --> 18:53.282
- I'll see you upstairs, okay?
- Wait!

18:54.687 --> 18:57.350
Honey, I'm sorry.
I went a little crazy.

18:57.376 --> 18:59.581
James. James.

19:00.416 --> 19:02.660
I want you to do something for me.

19:02.778 --> 19:05.472
- So, am I going to have a scar?
- No. The edges came together nicely.

19:05.517 --> 19:08.283
- It'll be small.
- Hey. I have to head back up to the ICU,

19:08.316 --> 19:11.963
but I wanted to suggest that you write
this case up for M and M next week.

19:12.015 --> 19:13.223
What's M and M?

19:13.456 --> 19:18.300
Uh, it's a conference where we present
our mistakes and learn from them.

19:18.315 --> 19:22.390
- You made a mistake with Alison?
- No. Will you please excuse us for a minute?

19:25.406 --> 19:28.173
- What-what are you trying to do?
- Trying to wake you up.

19:28.206 --> 19:30.791
Why are you talking like that in front
of a patient? How does that help anyone?

19:30.818 --> 19:32.600
Where'd you go to medical school?

19:33.106 --> 19:35.233
- Here.
- And your residency?

19:35.468 --> 19:37.652
- Here.
- Mm-hmm. Your internship?

19:37.688 --> 19:39.510
Why are you asking?
You know it was here.

19:39.537 --> 19:42.302
Because I think that you have
been lulled into complacency

19:42.328 --> 19:44.261
by too many years in this place.

19:44.768 --> 19:47.093
You know what? You got a problem
with the ER, you talk to Kovac.

19:47.115 --> 19:50.373
Well, no, it's too late for Kovac.
He's the old guard.

19:50.645 --> 19:53.010
I think you could really
turn things around here.

19:53.046 --> 19:55.132
You know what? Now, you're really
starting to bore me. How about this?

19:55.156 --> 19:58.500
How about you go up and harass your
own department, and stay out of mine?

19:59.158 --> 20:01.372
It's always nice to talk to you,
Dr. Pratt.

20:03.476 --> 20:05.421
Will someone please
make this jerk disappear?

20:05.457 --> 20:07.390
- Who?
- The guy is toxic.

20:07.426 --> 20:10.162
What guy?
Oh, hey, excuse me.

20:11.237 --> 20:12.452
Excuse me? Can you hold up?

20:12.476 --> 20:15.283
- Did you finish interviewing Megan Strand?
- Yeah.

20:15.317 --> 20:17.953
We're just waiting to see if we can get
a statement from Sophia when she wakes up.

20:18.006 --> 20:20.223
Oh, that might be a while.
She's intubated, but, listen,

20:20.247 --> 20:24.003
I was talking to Megan, and
her affect seems totally appropriate.

20:24.025 --> 20:25.920
The injury matches her story,
and I'm just...

20:26.118 --> 20:27.871
I don't know.
I'm not getting that abuse vibe.

20:27.978 --> 20:29.000
- Thanks, Doc.
- Yeah.

20:29.065 --> 20:31.681
Make sure you write that in the record.
It'll be helpful if this goes to court.

20:31.716 --> 20:34.681
- Right. Thanks.
- How much ? No-no promotional rate?

20:34.967 --> 20:37.173
What about frequent flyer programs?

20:37.387 --> 20:38.712
Triple A?

20:39.297 --> 20:41.623
Fine. Uh, three more nights
at the honeymoon suite.

20:41.645 --> 20:44.170
Charge the card. Don't get snarky.
I'm too fragile.

20:44.216 --> 20:46.051
Oh, I thought things were going well
with you and Hope.

20:46.077 --> 20:47.992
Yeah, they are.
Really well.

20:48.236 --> 20:50.253
Staircase girl has a head bleed.

20:52.578 --> 20:54.142
Frontal parenchymal bleed?

20:54.177 --> 20:57.113
Yeah, less common than a sub or epidural,
but consistent with a fall.

20:57.145 --> 20:59.162
Okay, I'll call Neurosurge.
Thanks.

20:59.378 --> 21:00.911
Hey, Neela, hey.

21:01.257 --> 21:04.801
- Have you heard anything from Ray yet?
- Why, no. I thought he'd be here.

21:05.288 --> 21:09.143
Yeah, well, I mean, that the ER closed,
maybe schedules got confusing.

21:09.176 --> 21:11.743
- Yeah.
- I'll try paging him again.

21:11.955 --> 21:14.173
Hey, Mayday, I hear you're
taking the gastroschisis kid up.

21:14.215 --> 21:16.151
Yeah, I'm just about to write
the admission orders.

21:16.176 --> 21:18.501
Operating on adhesions
create new adhesions?

21:18.538 --> 21:21.612
Possibly, but we don't have a choice
if he's acutely obstructed.

21:21.657 --> 21:23.953
All right. I'll keep him NPO.
Thanks.

21:24.188 --> 21:26.562
Hey, Morris, you got a snake breeder
with a fang in her leg.

21:26.607 --> 21:28.821
Nice seeing you, Tony.
Thanks for the consult.

21:33.177 --> 21:35.532
Hey, what?
What did I do?

21:35.947 --> 21:37.880
- This is easy for you, isn't it?
- What?

21:37.925 --> 21:40.710
"Hey, Mayday, did you see my gastroschisis
kid?" Like nothing happened.

21:40.738 --> 21:42.932
- Come on, Neela, you're not being fair.
- I mean, how can you be so casual?

21:42.946 --> 21:45.273
Hey, you're the one that broke up
with me, remember?

21:45.476 --> 21:47.693
- Everything just rolls right off of you.
- All right, you know what?

21:47.725 --> 21:49.462
Why don't you tell me
how upset you want me to be?

21:49.556 --> 21:51.280
On a scale of one to ten, what, a seven?

21:51.335 --> 21:53.393
And then, when you're feeling needy,
we'll crank it up to an eight,

21:53.436 --> 21:55.420
put it down to a five when
you want to get your work done.

21:55.466 --> 21:57.771
- Now you're just being an ass.
- You think this doesn't upset me?

21:57.786 --> 22:00.702
It does. This is painful for me,
but you want what you want.

22:00.735 --> 22:03.772
You know, so I just... We're trying to
figure how to work without the drama.

22:03.828 --> 22:06.840
But now I realize something-- you,
you like this. You want the drama.

22:06.875 --> 22:08.243
- That's not true.
- It is true.

22:08.276 --> 22:09.422
- I don't want the drama.
- No matter how I act,

22:09.447 --> 22:11.613
- you're gonna be upset.
- You're the one at the wedding being...

22:11.635 --> 22:14.663
Because that's the only way you can
maintain this stupid, narcissistic game.

22:19.805 --> 22:22.683
Wow. I hope that never happens to us.

22:25.866 --> 22:29.283
They managed to repair her damaged intestine,
but her blood pressure dropped very low.

22:29.315 --> 22:31.560
It'll be a while before we know anything.

22:32.405 --> 22:36.362
Six hours ago she was giving a talk
in front of hundreds of people.

22:37.097 --> 22:38.950
How did she end up here?

22:39.665 --> 22:45.623
Well, sometimes things just... happen.
There's really no way to make sense of it.

22:46.015 --> 22:47.640
She's not in pain?

22:47.925 --> 22:50.391
I'll make sure she has a morphine order.

22:52.315 --> 22:53.523
How's she doing?

22:53.658 --> 22:57.412
Still needs dopa to keep her systolic above 85.
And I think she's third spacing.

22:57.475 --> 23:00.470
She had a touch of DIC,
lost two liters in the OR.

23:00.748 --> 23:02.490
Hey, um, why didn't you scrub in?

23:02.645 --> 23:04.393
Well, I wasn't sure that you'd want me to.

23:04.437 --> 23:05.730
Why wouldn't I?

23:06.877 --> 23:08.950
- Men are impossible.
- Listen, Neela, about...

23:09.095 --> 23:11.100
Do you think I'm a narcissist?

23:11.848 --> 23:15.560
Well, to a certain extent, all surgeons are.
Yeah, it's good for the job.

23:15.607 --> 23:17.650
Hey, guys, uh, Mae Lee's off to the airport.

23:17.675 --> 23:21.172
I just wanted to thank you guys
for an amazing experience.

23:21.245 --> 23:24.631
- Good-bye, Mae Lee.
- Yeah, strong work this month, Mae Lee.

23:25.345 --> 23:28.270
- It's the ER.
- One final consult before you go?

23:30.965 --> 23:33.753
Call me if you're ever
in San Francisco.

23:36.085 --> 23:38.571
Little freak tried
to kiss me at the wedding.

23:39.295 --> 23:41.432
What's she still doing here?
Get her to the ICU.

23:41.446 --> 23:43.203
Oh, runs of v-tach,
she's not ready to move.

23:43.217 --> 23:45.542
Oh, come on.
It's a hundred feet of corridor,

23:45.576 --> 23:47.642
and it'd be better for her to code
in the ICU instead of here.

23:47.677 --> 23:49.573
- Well, for her or for us?
- I'm serious, Neela.

23:49.606 --> 23:52.292
You know, we got five full ORs,
we need to make room.

23:52.455 --> 23:53.641
Let's go.

23:54.976 --> 23:57.483
She loves tulips.
uh... yellow.

23:57.516 --> 23:59.782
No, no, no, no, no, uh, white. White.

23:59.825 --> 24:01.681
Two, two dozen white tulips...

24:01.865 --> 24:05.192
Hey, newlyweds, to be delivered
to room 1258 at the Ritz.

24:05.236 --> 24:06.732
How, how's it feel, guys?

24:06.906 --> 24:09.221
You know Morris is staying
in our honeymoon suite?

24:09.247 --> 24:11.131
- What?
- Yup. With Hope.

24:11.176 --> 24:12.170
They won't leave.

24:12.328 --> 24:14.512
Did you wake up the next
day feeling different?

24:14.546 --> 24:15.592
- Uh, not really.
- Yeah.

24:15.616 --> 24:17.272
- Just a little.
- Well... not that much.

24:17.466 --> 24:18.712
Well, your wedding was awesome.

24:18.747 --> 24:21.153
I just hope that thing I did didn't
make you lose your security deposit.

24:21.207 --> 24:22.900
- What thing?
- What?

24:23.037 --> 24:28.482
Hey, everyone, in the ER, for
the first time, Mr. and Mrs. Luka Kovac!

24:29.067 --> 24:33.311
Oh, sorry, Abby, Dr. and Mrs. Luka Kovac.
Doctor and doctor. Sorry.

24:33.355 --> 24:35.353
Hey, Chief, aren't you supposed
to be in Bora Bora by now?

24:35.376 --> 24:38.393
Uh, Hawaii. And I just attended
my last department head meeting

24:38.436 --> 24:41.251
- so I'm officially no longer your chief.
- You're kidding.

24:41.685 --> 24:45.133
It's like your wedding happened
and now everything's changed.

24:45.205 --> 24:49.112
You're married, uh, I'm with Hope,
uh, you're not the chief anymore,

24:49.158 --> 24:51.811
there's new ramps in the bathroom--
It's a brave new world.

24:51.835 --> 24:54.823
Gates is still a pain in the ass, though.
At least there's something you can count on.

24:54.858 --> 24:56.543
You done, Morris?
You had enough?

24:56.706 --> 24:59.222
Tony, there's a lawyer out there
who says he needs to talk to you.

24:59.248 --> 25:00.232
Thanks, Dawn.

25:00.256 --> 25:02.492
Hide, Gates.
I'll tell him you went home sick.

25:02.758 --> 25:05.340
- I'm going. See you at home.
- Okay.

25:05.747 --> 25:08.501
Uh... being married does
feel a little different.

25:08.527 --> 25:10.082
Yeah, it does.

25:10.298 --> 25:12.951
Aww... look at that.

25:13.915 --> 25:15.150
- Lucien.
- Hey, Luka.

25:15.208 --> 25:16.702
Abby, I saw the Cheetos bezoar.

25:16.737 --> 25:18.911
Send him home on Miralax,
have him follow up with GI.

25:19.017 --> 25:20.901
- Okay, done.
- Nice wedding, by the way.

25:20.956 --> 25:22.790
I offered to replace the bidet.

25:23.595 --> 25:24.753
What bidet?

25:24.927 --> 25:28.013
Abby! Your head injury
in Trauma Two lost her pulse.

25:28.298 --> 25:29.571
Clear!

25:30.605 --> 25:32.443
- Still v-fib.
- Going again.

25:32.576 --> 25:34.351
And... clear!

25:36.176 --> 25:38.340
I was on the phone, they paged me.
What's going on?

25:38.408 --> 25:40.103
Sophia's heart went
into a dangerous rhythm.

25:40.127 --> 25:41.370
- Oh, my God.
- Epi's in.

25:41.406 --> 25:43.800
All right, back up, back up!
Clear!

25:44.715 --> 25:47.380
- Resuming CPR.
- Oh, no, no, baby, don't do this.

25:47.396 --> 25:49.711
- Lidocaine's ready.
- Okay, is neurosurge involved?

25:49.736 --> 25:52.112
No, there's nothing to evacuate,
the bleed's parenchymal.

25:52.137 --> 25:55.042
- You can't leave me now, you hear me?
- Go ahead, give the lido.

25:55.115 --> 25:58.731
Things that we said and the way we were,
it's not us, right?

26:00.148 --> 26:03.260
- You're my rock, always calm.
- Another epi, charge 360.

26:03.307 --> 26:06.021
Megan, when you said Chicago changed her,
what did you mean?

26:06.216 --> 26:10.422
That she's so testy, and, and paranoid.
Please don't die.

26:10.866 --> 26:13.201
Okay, clear. Please clear.
Watch out.

26:20.356 --> 26:22.182
- We have a pulse.
- She's back.

26:29.218 --> 26:30.673
What do you think of this film?

26:31.347 --> 26:34.082
Uh... Frontal lobe bleed, no shift.

26:35.736 --> 26:39.971
You think it could be a preexisting AVM
exacerbated by the head trauma?

26:40.325 --> 26:44.160
I mean, a frontal lobe mass would explain
the personality and the behavioral changes--

26:44.796 --> 26:47.043
- You're a romantic, Abby.
- What?

26:47.325 --> 26:49.482
You don't want to believe
that after years of partnership,

26:49.516 --> 26:51.333
they started hating each other.

26:52.217 --> 26:54.742
Call Radiology.
If you're right, she needs angio.

26:57.527 --> 26:59.521
The girl's lived with you for ten years.

26:59.547 --> 27:01.573
You're the closest thing
she's had to a father.

27:01.596 --> 27:03.143
So, that's gotta count for something, right?

27:03.155 --> 27:07.013
It does. Given the situation, I'd say
you have equal standing to seek custody.

27:07.035 --> 27:09.960
Equal? The same as her grandparents?
Even though I'm not a blood relative?

27:10.006 --> 27:12.463
Yep. Especially if Sarah wants
to stay with you.

27:12.637 --> 27:15.032
Wow. Well, I just thought
because I wasn't related...

27:15.046 --> 27:18.002
This is good. All right, okay, good, good.
What, what else? What's next?

27:18.028 --> 27:20.983
Well, first thing is to talk to Sarah.
Make sure she wants to stay.

27:21.006 --> 27:22.270
She does. I know she does.

27:22.327 --> 27:25.212
12-year-olds can be fickle.
I've got two adolescents at home.

27:25.248 --> 27:26.863
- Talk to her.
- All right, then what?

27:27.077 --> 27:29.752
Then call the grandparents
and let them know.

27:29.958 --> 27:31.802
- So, that's it?
- That's it.

27:33.385 --> 27:34.453
Okay.

27:35.767 --> 27:38.221
Injecting the cyanoacrylate.

27:38.615 --> 27:42.023
Amazing pickup, Abby.
What made you think of AVM?

27:42.358 --> 27:44.732
Well, her girlfriend kept going
on about how she'd become

27:44.777 --> 27:46.532
like a totally different person lately.

27:46.558 --> 27:48.093
Lots of couples go through that,

27:48.118 --> 27:51.443
they don't all have arterio-venous
malformations in their brain.

27:52.075 --> 27:54.402
Well, it was just a hunch, I guess.

27:55.547 --> 27:57.042
Congrats on the wedding.

27:57.246 --> 28:00.143
You think it's going to be strange to be
a husband and wife working together?

28:00.235 --> 28:03.361
No, it's definitely strange
to have people refer to us that way.

28:03.376 --> 28:05.431
Get used to it. Contrast.

28:05.628 --> 28:07.322
- Are you married?
- Oh, no.

28:07.346 --> 28:12.210
Only people I ever meet are doctors.
And doctors make crummy husbands.

28:12.407 --> 28:13.762
No offense.

28:15.127 --> 28:19.772
You know, I used to think it'd be cool
to end up with a composer or an artist,

28:19.806 --> 28:22.942
someone that would bring something totally
different to the dinner table, but...

28:23.816 --> 28:27.110
you know, it's really nice to go home
to somebody who understands all this.

28:27.925 --> 28:29.172
I can see that.

28:29.598 --> 28:33.002
Look. No more antegrade
opacification of contrast.

28:33.037 --> 28:35.031
- So the embolization worked?
- Yep.

28:35.245 --> 28:36.912
- Great.
- Very nice.

28:37.966 --> 28:39.760
What are you doing here?

28:41.375 --> 28:43.132
Oh, I just came to check on the patient.

28:43.207 --> 28:47.500
Uh... wait a minute, I thought that
Morris was the attending, so you...

28:48.955 --> 28:52.592
Okay, uh, thanks, Betina.
I'm going to give Megan the good news.

28:53.246 --> 28:56.082
I was on a little break, so I thought
I'd bring you some coffee.

28:56.117 --> 28:58.141
Oh, don't drink coffee.

28:58.618 --> 29:01.013
Well, that's, uh... good to know.

29:01.876 --> 29:03.421
Now, listen, Betina...

29:04.168 --> 29:06.400
I just want to hangout
with you for a while.

29:07.235 --> 29:12.180
- No plans, no games, just me.
- And the patient here on the table.

29:13.628 --> 29:16.313
You can stay but don't touch anything.

29:16.955 --> 29:20.051
Hospital day 12 for this
72-year-old with a GI bleed.

29:20.117 --> 29:22.033
Vitals stable overnight,
pressures in the 90 to...

29:22.048 --> 29:24.733
Who was the first person to measure
blood pressure, anybody?

29:25.055 --> 29:27.972
It was a clergyman in the year 17...
blah, blah, blah.

29:28.137 --> 29:32.471
And he took a glass tube and he stuck it
into the carotid artery of a horse

29:32.486 --> 29:35.991
and he was very surprised to see the blood
rise up into the air about nine feet.

29:36.008 --> 29:38.513
Why he did this exactly, I have no idea.

29:38.538 --> 29:40.900
I mean it's very, you know,
impractical for human beings.

29:40.918 --> 29:43.262
And I'm sure the horse didn't appreciate
it. Sorry about that.

29:43.278 --> 29:45.472
Go ahead, go ahead.
F-Finish, Katey, go.

29:45.576 --> 29:48.310
Uh... next we have
a 64-year-old presenting...

29:48.325 --> 29:51.231
Hi, we need a room! This is Alison MacKenzie,
our septic with the bowel perf.

29:51.277 --> 29:54.400
Lost a lot of blood, having some ectopy, and
didn't tolerate the trip down the hall too well.

29:54.425 --> 29:56.663
Tachy, on two pressors.
CVP is only six.

29:56.676 --> 29:58.750
- Run of v-tach.
- Can I ask you a question?

29:58.776 --> 30:00.701
Why didn't you stabilize
this patient in post-op

30:00.725 --> 30:03.740
instead of bringing us
this shocky, fragile mess?

30:03.805 --> 30:05.581
Well, she got four units of blood and...

30:05.595 --> 30:08.703
Look, I'm not an idiot, I know about
the post-op audit that Dubenko's doing.

30:08.726 --> 30:11.482
He doesn't want this patient in his PACU
because it'll mess up his data.

30:11.506 --> 30:13.772
- No, that's not what's happening here.
- He'd rather have her code and die

30:13.787 --> 30:16.001
- in the ICU than on his watch.
- Die?

30:16.015 --> 30:17.943
Yeah, well, we'll try to avoid that.

30:18.108 --> 30:21.273
- You tell Lucien this can't happen again.
- You know, this wasn't his idea.

30:21.308 --> 30:22.671
- Yeah, right.
- You know, I...

30:22.697 --> 30:25.051
- I thought she was ready to move.
- V-tach!

30:26.078 --> 30:27.142
No pulse.

30:28.006 --> 30:31.490
- Starting compression.
- Oh, no, this can't be happening.

30:32.046 --> 30:34.241
- Charge to 200.
- Nice job, Neela.

30:34.275 --> 30:36.652
Let's just stay focused
on the patient, shall we?

30:36.918 --> 30:37.933
Clear.

30:38.065 --> 30:40.570
Katey, someone on the phone says
they've got to talk to you right now,

30:40.605 --> 30:42.433
- it's an emergency.
- I'm in the middle of a code.

30:42.447 --> 30:43.691
No, go, just go, just go.

30:43.925 --> 30:47.153
And there's a guy outside begging
to come in to see this patient.

30:47.445 --> 30:50.963
- He's not family. He can't be here.
- You might want to rethink that.

30:51.007 --> 30:51.833
What?

30:51.846 --> 30:54.671
Look, your wife is doing everything
she can not to die right now.

30:54.728 --> 30:56.692
She could probably use all
the support she could get.

30:56.716 --> 30:58.973
- Epi's in.
- Okay, going again.

30:59.508 --> 31:00.693
Clear.

31:05.115 --> 31:07.943
Well, her heart is beating
at a normal rhythm, but...

31:08.138 --> 31:10.793
her blood pressure
is still dangerously low.

31:10.817 --> 31:12.300
Isn't there something
you can do about that?

31:12.317 --> 31:15.000
We've maxed out the medications.
They're not helping.

31:15.028 --> 31:17.850
It's possible that the part of her brain
that controls the blood pressure

31:17.875 --> 31:19.423
isn't functioning properly.

31:19.616 --> 31:21.303
- What?
- Why not?

31:21.537 --> 31:24.220
Because she received 45 minutes of CPR.

31:24.236 --> 31:26.921
Her brain was deprived
of oxygen during that time.

31:26.947 --> 31:30.742
And when that happens, we often
see some degree of neurologic injury.

31:30.778 --> 31:34.552
She walked in here today with
a stomach ache and now you're telling me

31:34.577 --> 31:36.281
her brain is damaged.

31:38.636 --> 31:42.603
Look, I don't want to take away all hope,
but I want to be realistic here.

31:42.815 --> 31:44.623
If she survives...

31:44.868 --> 31:47.843
there most likely
will be neurologic deficits.

31:48.787 --> 31:52.143
- When will we know?
- Well, there's no way to predict.

31:52.407 --> 31:54.440
It's a waiting game now, I'm afraid.

31:55.696 --> 31:56.933
Sorry.

31:57.515 --> 31:58.681
I see.

32:03.227 --> 32:04.623
You can go.

32:06.875 --> 32:08.301
Please go.

32:16.407 --> 32:20.210
Before she went into surgery,
she asked me to give this to you.

32:20.238 --> 32:24.980
James. I resented it for so long
this thing you two have.

32:26.287 --> 32:28.713
Even now I've got to share her with you.

32:36.528 --> 32:38.052
What did he give him?

32:39.378 --> 32:40.471
I don't know.

32:40.878 --> 32:42.173
Data.

32:43.098 --> 32:46.480
- Some kind of treasured lab secret.
- Well, how do you know?

32:47.037 --> 32:49.312
Well, you work in the ICU long enough,

32:49.338 --> 32:52.680
you start to recognize these scenes
are frighteningly familiar.

32:53.608 --> 32:57.031
They kiss their spouse, their kids,
they say good-bye to friends...

32:57.317 --> 32:59.342
A certain percentage have a deep,
dark secret,

32:59.378 --> 33:03.413
like an illegitimate child or
a secret debt or something,

33:03.445 --> 33:06.712
but occasionally you see something
like this. Practicalities.

33:07.047 --> 33:09.372
Information that must be passed on.

33:10.287 --> 33:14.523
A computer password or a combo
to a safe or something.

33:15.388 --> 33:19.422
- You're pretty jaded.
- Many long, tortuous cases.

33:20.085 --> 33:23.482
You know, the human psyche was
not designed to deal with this.

33:23.925 --> 33:27.063
Cave dwellers had to deal
with a lot more actual death,

33:27.948 --> 33:34.151
but they were not subjected to the slow,
mechanized torture that is the ICU.

33:34.205 --> 33:35.623
Well, why do you do it then?

33:36.025 --> 33:40.701
To save the salvageable and
to give the rest a dignified death.

33:41.955 --> 33:44.511
Just a little low on dignity these days.

33:46.005 --> 33:49.330
Well, I'd have a hard time working here.

33:49.708 --> 33:53.200
Surgeons just like to get in,
do their job, and get out.

33:53.356 --> 33:55.793
Yeah, well, that's your job, but...

33:56.338 --> 33:59.781
we are left to deal
with the dregs and it's not pretty.

34:02.135 --> 34:04.012
I just want us all to do better.

34:05.107 --> 34:06.973
I'm sick of seeing people die.

34:10.856 --> 34:13.502
She had what's known as
an arterial venous malformation

34:13.525 --> 34:16.380
in the part of her brain that's
responsible for mood and personality.

34:16.416 --> 34:18.520
That explains why
she seemed different to you.

34:18.666 --> 34:19.880
And it's fixed now?

34:19.906 --> 34:23.340
Yes, the radiologist was able to clot off
the veins using a special kind of glue.

34:23.418 --> 34:27.292
- And she'll go back to the way she was?
- Uh, that's the hope, yeah.

34:29.407 --> 34:31.051
Did you hear that, baby?

34:31.915 --> 34:33.293
It's all going to be okay.

34:33.527 --> 34:36.650
All right, she's waking up, so we're going
to take out her breathing tube now.

34:36.705 --> 34:39.030
Nifs are good and
she's following commands perfectly.

34:39.085 --> 34:41.473
Okay, I'll need you to cough
on the count of three. Okay?

34:41.614 --> 34:44.503
Ready? One, two, three.

34:52.117 --> 34:53.382
Megan...

34:53.908 --> 34:58.431
I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry.

34:59.608 --> 35:01.760
I was upset. I just...

35:02.998 --> 35:04.921
I didn't mean to push you.

35:17.627 --> 35:20.500
Chocolate-covered strawberries,
room 1258.

35:21.225 --> 35:23.793
No. No, n-n-no, I haven't checked out.

35:24.518 --> 35:26.903
- No, there must be some mistake.
- There's not a mistake.

35:26.926 --> 35:30.281
- I checked out of the hotel.
- What? No. W-Why?

35:30.298 --> 35:33.921
- I-I paid for three more nights.
- I know you did, which is crazy.

35:33.976 --> 35:35.953
- I got them to refund your card.
- I don't, I don't want a refund.

35:36.007 --> 35:37.212
Let's call them.

35:37.246 --> 35:40.013
Archie, stop.
No, look...

35:40.046 --> 35:45.872
the flowers, the spa treatments--
it's all lovely, but I don't need it.

35:46.087 --> 35:48.671
- Time to get back to real life.
- I don't want real life.

35:48.706 --> 35:52.281
I-I-I like fake life where we,
where we wake up together

35:52.315 --> 35:54.810
and take bubble baths
and eat bonbons for breakfast.

35:54.838 --> 35:57.272
I don't want our crazy
wedding fling to end.

36:00.018 --> 36:02.312
Who said anything about it ending?

36:03.577 --> 36:04.923
I wasn't sure if...

36:06.516 --> 36:14.290
Dr. Morris, I have not done
this with anyone in a long,

36:15.017 --> 36:18.532
long time, and it's not because...

36:19.338 --> 36:21.663
I haven't had the opportunity.

36:23.415 --> 36:27.700
I decided to sleep with you
because it means something.

36:30.958 --> 36:32.412
This isn't a fling.

36:33.276 --> 36:35.953
At least not for me.

36:44.348 --> 36:47.433
She snapped; she had a momentary lapse.
It's not like she's a chronic abuser.

36:47.477 --> 36:50.041
We don't know that, and even
if we did, it doesn't matter.

36:50.078 --> 36:51.810
Hey, guys.
Did Ray ever show up?

36:51.877 --> 36:53.273
- No. - No.
- Well, did he call?

36:53.307 --> 36:55.681
It's not like Megan was trying
to throw her down the stairs.

36:55.716 --> 36:57.362
Oh, please, give me a break.
She pushed her.

36:57.418 --> 37:00.760
If this didn't happen, Sophia's AVM
wouldn't have been diagnosed.

37:00.805 --> 37:03.303
Excuse me, is Dr. Pratt still in?
Nurses' station.

37:03.335 --> 37:05.240
All I'm saying is one incident
doesn't make it abuse.

37:05.275 --> 37:08.280
She responded to anger with violence.
That's, like, the definition.

37:08.448 --> 37:10.472
- Dr. Pratt.
- Oh, boy.

37:10.517 --> 37:13.272
- I thought I was done with you already.
- Millicent Lawford.

37:13.308 --> 37:17.563
MI in the ER waiting room, sat there
seven hours without being triaged.

37:17.755 --> 37:19.003
Gertie Minton.

37:19.185 --> 37:23.701
Renal failure, 12 hours to be seen,
and then arrested from hyperkalemia.

37:24.097 --> 37:29.183
Derek Shank, in the ER three days
without DVT prophylaxis,

37:29.228 --> 37:33.872
died-- died--
of a PE before he made it to the floor.

37:34.708 --> 37:37.883
- We can do better for these people.
- Okay, look, look, I get your point, okay?

37:37.916 --> 37:41.252
But the problems are systemic.
Too many people, not enough resources.

37:41.278 --> 37:43.781
Now, how do you suppose
that we address that?

37:43.978 --> 37:48.232
Well, first, I think we start by not
believing that this is the best we can do.

37:48.438 --> 37:49.652
Because it's not.

37:50.327 --> 37:52.860
- Right.
- These are for you.

38:40.695 --> 38:43.980
So I could totally tell that Melissa
was copying off my paper,

38:44.016 --> 38:47.280
but if I tell on her,
then I'm a snitch, and if I don't,

38:47.316 --> 38:50.033
- then I'm like an accomplice, right?
- Right.

38:50.488 --> 38:53.940
And I know, I know,
she's just cheating herself,

38:54.028 --> 38:57.090
but it still seems like
she wouldn't do that.

38:59.805 --> 39:05.112
Yeah, and, uh, we learned in chemistry
today how to freebase cocaine.

39:05.157 --> 39:06.101
Really?

39:07.545 --> 39:10.922
Tony, you're totally not listening to me.

39:15.148 --> 39:19.370
Sarah, when your grandparents wanted
you to move in with them, I thought 

39:19.418 --> 39:22.262
that, maybe, it was the best thing.

39:23.517 --> 39:27.722
I don't want to go to a new school, Tony.
I don't want to go and live with them.

39:28.507 --> 39:30.272
I was scared and I...

39:30.595 --> 39:34.921
I just didn't think I had
what it takes to do this,

39:35.766 --> 39:39.491
but then when we took the test,
I realized that...

39:40.816 --> 39:44.400
I wish it had gone the other way.
I wanted to be your dad.

39:47.127 --> 39:48.620
I wanted that, too.

39:50.495 --> 39:51.571
So...

39:52.798 --> 39:57.232
I work a lot and I'm messy

39:57.518 --> 40:01.492
and I may embarrass you
at father-daughter dances...

40:06.497 --> 40:09.122
...but I really love you, Sarah.
You're my family.

40:10.935 --> 40:12.330
And it turns out that...

40:14.915 --> 40:19.031
if you want to stay with me, you can,

40:19.117 --> 40:21.642
if you-- I mean, if you still want to.

40:47.596 --> 40:50.142
- I missed you guys.
- Missed you, too.

40:54.478 --> 40:55.673
How was your shift?

40:55.875 --> 40:58.531
Oh... who cares?
It's done.

40:58.786 --> 41:01.881
No work for two weeks,
the honeymoon starts now.

41:02.427 --> 41:05.131
Does that mean you're ready
to change into the bikini?

41:05.378 --> 41:09.142
- Maybe after Joe goes to bed.
- Joe, go to bed now.

41:14.068 --> 41:15.061
I got him.

41:15.875 --> 41:17.062
Sweetie...

41:18.135 --> 41:19.450
You playing soccer?

41:20.775 --> 41:22.102
Hello.

41:49.425 --> 41:51.883
Hey, Donald, it's Kevin.
Yeah.

41:52.085 --> 41:53.880
Look, I'm glad I caught you.

41:54.576 --> 41:59.263
Do you remember the thing that
we discussed earlier about the ER?

41:59.876 --> 42:02.701
Yeah, well, I can't believe
I'm saying this, but, um,

42:03.236 --> 42:05.893
I think I've changed my mind.
I have changed my mind.

42:06.275 --> 42:08.032
I'll do it.
Okay.

42:08.105 --> 42:09.621
- Have a good one.
- Oh, good night.

42:10.005 --> 42:11.470
Oh, good night, good night.

42:11.676 --> 42:14.403
Stay out of the ICU.
That guy's a dick.

42:37.006 --> 42:41.002
