00:11.400 --> 00:13.038
Hiya, Daddy.

00:13.120 --> 00:15.680
Shh, shh. Mummy's asleep.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.074

00:38.160 --> 00:40.594
Morning.
- Thanks, Pete.

00:41.880 --> 00:43.598
United, eh?

00:43.680 --> 00:47.116
Feel free to put some posters
of your own up, you know.

00:47.200 --> 00:48.633
Captains of industry.

00:48.720 --> 00:50.199
Ugh!

00:50.280 --> 00:51.759
Oh, sorry. No sugar.

00:51.840 --> 00:54.912
Oh, we do have some.
- Great, just the one spoon, thanks.

00:59.600 --> 01:03.434
<i>Darling, that's lovely.</i>

01:03.520 --> 01:05.397
Can I play it again for you?

01:05.480 --> 01:07.755
Not right now, but in a minute maybe.

01:07.840 --> 01:09.353
Ramona, are you free tonight?

01:09.440 --> 01:11.874
I'm having a few friends round
for a girls' night in.

01:11.960 --> 01:13.712
Yeah, that sounds good.

01:13.800 --> 01:16.030
So how many are coming?
- Thus far, two.

01:16.120 --> 01:17.678
You and me, but I'm only up to the Ds.

01:17.760 --> 01:18.875
Ah.

01:20.400 --> 01:22.709
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, great!</i>

01:22.800 --> 01:24.756
OK, you turd. See you later.

01:24.840 --> 01:27.070
Pete. Drink tonight. Whoo-hoo!

01:27.160 --> 01:29.993
We're supposed to be filling in
our adoption forms tonight.

01:30.080 --> 01:32.913
Oh, another day won't make any difference.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.117
It's a question of priorities, Adam.
Which is more important?

01:38.240 --> 01:39.798
Hello?

01:39.880 --> 01:41.279
Karen, hi!

01:42.320 --> 01:44.276
Tonight, erm...

01:44.360 --> 01:46.430
Yeah, that would be really great.

01:46.520 --> 01:48.476
What time?

01:48.560 --> 01:50.915
Fine. OK, I'll see you there. Bye!

01:51.960 --> 01:53.552
Well, you're going out with Pete.

01:53.640 --> 01:56.279
And, anyway,
she needs some support at the moment.

01:56.360 --> 01:58.794
Oh, no, it's a question of priorities.

02:00.400 --> 02:02.356
Ooh! Hey, you!

02:11.240 --> 02:13.117
I thought you were staying in a hotel.

02:13.200 --> 02:16.556
Yeah, I did for the first couple of days.
It didn't suit me, really.

02:16.640 --> 02:18.119
Too expensive?

02:18.200 --> 02:19.758
No.

02:19.840 --> 02:24.038
It wasn't cheap but, er,
it was going down to breakfast, actually.

02:24.120 --> 02:25.712
What?

02:25.800 --> 02:27.518
You might think I'm being paranoid,

02:27.600 --> 02:30.034
<i>but the place seemed to be
full of people like me.</i>

02:30.120 --> 02:34.591
<i>Middle-aged men, cast out of the marital
home for some transgression or other.</i>

02:36.760 --> 02:38.716
So depressing.

02:38.800 --> 02:40.756
Maybe they were sales reps.

02:42.080 --> 02:43.832
No, they didn't look that depressed.

02:44.920 --> 02:46.433
How's it going with him?
- Good.

02:46.520 --> 02:48.954
No, really.

02:49.040 --> 02:50.996
It beats living on your own by a long chalk.

02:51.080 --> 02:53.435
Pete reckons I've improved his
quality of life.

02:53.520 --> 02:56.080
Oh, yeah? How've you done that?
- Well, one example...

02:56.160 --> 02:58.754
Everything you ever need to know is here.

03:00.480 --> 03:03.677
Indian, Chinese, Italian.

03:03.760 --> 03:05.591
Modern eclectic.

03:06.640 --> 03:09.916
Thai, Mexican,
good old-fashioned fish and chips.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.956
Right. I'll tell you what...

03:13.680 --> 03:15.750
Why don't we sort them into
separate drawers?

03:15.840 --> 03:18.115
You know, those that deliver
and those that don't.

03:18.200 --> 03:19.474
<i>That is a good idea.</i>

03:19.560 --> 03:21.915
The simplest ones are often the best.

03:22.960 --> 03:26.919
Right, so where shall we three amigos
eat tonight?

03:27.000 --> 03:30.879
Can Daddy read me a story tonight?

03:30.960 --> 03:34.111
Not tonight, my angel, no,
because Daddy is staying with Uncle Pete.

03:34.200 --> 03:36.998
Oh, my God!
How many girls are coming tonight?

03:37.080 --> 03:39.753
Five. And that is including you and me.

03:39.840 --> 03:42.149
Well, I don't think we are
going to go thirsty.

03:42.240 --> 03:45.437
Honestly, Ramona, I have been phoning
around all day. It's pathetic.

03:45.520 --> 03:47.715
It's not like people have got better
things to do.

03:47.800 --> 03:51.190
Ah, but they do because Bad Girls
is on the television tonight.

03:51.280 --> 03:53.999
Honestly, it was either,
''The baby's got a cough,''

03:54.080 --> 03:57.197
or, ''Simon's too tired to baby-sit,''
or - I know what was one -

03:57.280 --> 04:00.158
''It was too short notice.''
What are we supposed to do?

04:00.240 --> 04:03.437
Pencil in next Thursday
for a bit of spontaneity?

04:03.520 --> 04:05.351
Uh-huh. Actually, Bella is coming.

04:05.440 --> 04:08.477
Now, Bella, I have not seen for years
and that woman is a laugh.

04:08.560 --> 04:10.516
God, we used to cane it.

04:10.600 --> 04:12.670
Actually, I don't know if we've got enough.

04:13.760 --> 04:15.512
So, how about a curry?

04:15.600 --> 04:17.351
I vote for Chinese.

04:17.440 --> 04:19.589
What about modern eclectic?

04:19.680 --> 04:20.908
All right, then, curry.

04:22.520 --> 04:23.953
Bella!

04:24.040 --> 04:25.871
Hello!
- Hello!

04:25.960 --> 04:27.837
Gosh, hi, how are you?

04:27.920 --> 04:31.754
Well, I hope I'm not late. I had terrible
trouble getting the children off.

04:31.840 --> 04:33.671
Francesca didn't want me to go out.

04:33.760 --> 04:36.149
You know what they're like at that age.
- Yes, I do!

04:36.240 --> 04:37.753
Oh, you look lovely!

04:37.840 --> 04:40.752
Thanks. You look...very floral.

04:40.840 --> 04:42.398
Come in. Let me get you a drink.

04:42.480 --> 04:45.119
Oh, just water for me.
If I drink, I'll be up all night.

04:45.200 --> 04:49.193
I will be anyway because Oscar's teething.
Anyway, I'm driving.

04:49.280 --> 04:51.236
I'll get the door.

04:51.320 --> 04:54.198
Can I introduce Jo? Jo, this is Bella.

04:54.280 --> 04:57.113
Hi, nice to meet you.
- Hello, nice to meet you too.

04:57.200 --> 04:58.633
I'll go and get the door.

04:58.720 --> 05:01.518
Would you like a drink?
- Oh, no, I'm just drinking water.

05:01.600 --> 05:04.068
Hello! - You don't mind me bringing
a friend, do you?

05:04.160 --> 05:05.832
<i>God, not at all. The more the merrier.</i>

05:05.920 --> 05:07.876
You know Jane.
- Yes, hello.

05:07.960 --> 05:09.916
Jane? No!

05:10.000 --> 05:12.434
Told me straight. Wants us to
get back together.

05:12.520 --> 05:17.116
She said that when we met on the street,
it wasn't a coincidence, she contrived it.

05:17.200 --> 05:18.758
You mean, she's stalking you?

05:18.840 --> 05:21.752
No, not stalking, no. She's just around.

05:21.840 --> 05:23.478
Does Rachel know about this?

05:23.560 --> 05:26.028
Are you wise?
- Are you? You're playing with fire.

05:26.120 --> 05:28.554
Oh, bollocks.
I admit, at my stag do, I wobbled a bit.

05:28.640 --> 05:31.632
Which Rachel knows nothing about.
- Yeah, and doesn't need to.

05:31.720 --> 05:35.156
Look, it's OK. It's not a problem.
Jane knows I'm not interested.

05:35.240 --> 05:38.152
Adam, look, I really don't think
you should see her again.

05:38.240 --> 05:40.993
That's not very nice.
She's new in town, doesn't know anyone.

05:41.080 --> 05:44.516
She'll meet someone else
and forget all about me. Tell him, will you?

05:44.600 --> 05:46.716
No, I agree.

05:46.800 --> 05:48.677
I don't think you should see her again.

05:52.280 --> 05:55.670
Well, you'll forgive me if I don't take
marriage guidance from you two.

05:58.120 --> 06:01.078
Oh, God, the first time, oh!

06:01.160 --> 06:02.639
It's too long ago to remember.

06:02.720 --> 06:05.917
It is!

06:06.000 --> 06:10.869
Ah, well, it was on a bench - which didn't
help - erm, and it was freezing -

06:10.960 --> 06:13.554
which didn't help either,
if you know what I mean.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.073
Was it Adam?

06:15.160 --> 06:16.798
Oh, my God!

06:18.320 --> 06:23.110
It was romantic, though, I swear, cos the
waves were crashing against the rocks below,

06:23.200 --> 06:27.159
and the spray was raining down from above,
but, my God, it was so cold.

06:27.240 --> 06:30.312
I never knew pneumonia could be
a sexually transmitted disease.

06:31.400 --> 06:34.597
Well, my first time, I threw up...
and so did he.

06:35.840 --> 06:37.478
My first time, I cried.

06:37.560 --> 06:39.516
Mind you, so did he.

06:41.800 --> 06:44.837
Yeah, but if you're in love, you know,
like I was.

06:44.920 --> 06:46.911
I mean, my God, he was so special.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.991
No-one else has ever come close.

06:49.080 --> 06:51.640
Oh, God!

06:53.440 --> 06:57.433
First love, it's just a pain in the arse.
It ruins you for everybody else.

06:57.520 --> 06:59.476
I'm not sure I agree with that, actually.

06:59.560 --> 07:00.754
What about you?

07:00.840 --> 07:03.957
No. The most recent is definitely the best.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.958
Do you know what?
I'm not sure I agree with that, either.

07:08.040 --> 07:10.891
I don't...
I don't.

07:13.360 --> 07:15.510
What about you, Bella?
- Lord, erm...

07:15.600 --> 07:20.674
My first time erm...
was with my driving instructor.

07:20.760 --> 07:23.320
God, I was a completely different
person then.

07:23.400 --> 07:25.356
Yep. You certainly were.

07:25.440 --> 07:28.671
Have you thought about

07:28.760 --> 07:32.469
when you're going to tell your children
about sex? I mean...

07:33.680 --> 07:35.636
Right, back to The Nag's Head.

07:36.680 --> 07:38.238
Where's your boyfriend?

07:38.320 --> 07:40.470
What?

07:40.560 --> 07:42.949
Oh, he's having a pee, I think.

07:43.040 --> 07:47.477
Excuse me, you haven't got any change,
have you, for the cigarette machine?

07:47.560 --> 07:50.313
Yeah, sure, yeah.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.428
Somewhere.

08:00.920 --> 08:02.876
It must be a No.2.

08:02.960 --> 08:04.598
Adam!

08:04.680 --> 08:05.908
Come on!

08:06.000 --> 08:08.389
Quick, quick, lend me 50p.
- What for?

08:08.480 --> 08:10.789
I think I might have just pulled.

08:10.880 --> 08:13.519
What? In the loo?
- No! No, by the fag machine.

08:13.600 --> 08:14.828
Oh, nice.

08:14.920 --> 08:17.480
It might be nice if you hurry up.
I might miss my chance.

08:17.560 --> 08:19.232
Come on, you're not serious, are you?

08:19.320 --> 08:21.914
Why?
- What about Jenny?

08:22.000 --> 08:26.312
Jenny left me. - It's a bit quick
to be looking for somebody else.

08:26.400 --> 08:28.356
David, it's just a bit of fun.

08:28.440 --> 08:30.590
Actually, she looks like she
could be a lot of fun.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.751
Don't wait up.

08:40.679 --> 08:44.389
Well, I'd say she'll help keep
the voices at bay.

08:45.440 --> 08:47.032
What voices?

08:52.280 --> 08:58.150
I mean, skiing is very expensive, particularly
if you take the children, but they love it.

08:58.240 --> 09:00.913
They look so sweet coming down the slopes.

09:01.000 --> 09:05.152
<i>Yeah, especially when they fall over
and break their precious necks.</i>

09:05.240 --> 09:09.518
Well, I am sorry, I'm sorry, but...

09:09.600 --> 09:12.398
do you have to talk about children
all night long, Bella?

09:12.480 --> 09:16.598
Well, I don't think we have, have we?

09:16.680 --> 09:19.877
Well, actually, yes, you have.
I'm sorry, but you have.

09:19.960 --> 09:22.997
I mean, Jesus, you used to have
a real personality, you know.

09:23.080 --> 09:25.355
You used to be such a laugh and it's now...

09:25.440 --> 09:29.877
Now it's like you've got no personality left.
It's like they've sucked the life out of you.

09:29.960 --> 09:33.794
Precious little Francesca
and darling bloody Oscar!

09:33.880 --> 09:36.713
I mean, Jesus, it's like you've been
taken over by the aliens.

09:36.800 --> 09:45.390
I mean, God, Bella, it's like you're dying inside
and I feel like I'm dying listening to you!

09:46.480 --> 09:47.879
I like my life.

09:47.960 --> 09:51.873
Yeah, well, you know what?
You're welcome to it.

09:58.840 --> 10:00.239
Joshy! Come on!

10:00.320 --> 10:02.276
I'm playing for Mummy!

10:02.360 --> 10:04.669
I think she wants to hear later,
yeah? Come on!

10:04.760 --> 10:07.832
Let's go get something to eat.
There's a good boy.

10:22.040 --> 10:23.996
You make the breakfast.

10:24.080 --> 10:27.072
No, you make breakfast.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.558
Sorry.

10:38.560 --> 10:40.152
Morning.
- Morning.

10:48.520 --> 10:51.318
The state you're in,
I thought you could do with a fry-up.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.038
Are you the naked chef?

10:54.960 --> 10:56.359
Jane!

10:56.440 --> 10:57.714
Nice look.

10:57.800 --> 11:01.156
Does Rachel know you're here?
- Of course. She invited me to stay.

11:01.240 --> 11:03.879
Heavy night at Karen's last night.
- What? You were there?

11:03.960 --> 11:06.474
Mm-mm. Comparing notes. First love.

11:06.560 --> 11:07.879
Oh, God.

11:07.960 --> 11:11.236
Don't worry, I didn't mention your name.
First time.

11:11.320 --> 11:12.912
Oh, wait. Come on, it was very cold.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.594
Not a problem.
Kris had to contend with going for Rachel.

11:15.680 --> 11:17.272
Bollocks.

11:17.360 --> 11:19.191
Oh, juicy.

11:19.280 --> 11:20.838
Jane, what are you doing?

11:20.920 --> 11:24.071
I'm teasing you.
You should be called the ''little'' chef.

11:24.160 --> 11:25.513
<i>Good morning.</i>

11:25.600 --> 11:26.715
Oh, hi!

11:26.800 --> 11:29.234
Adam, cover yourself up, mate.

11:29.320 --> 11:32.153
Jane's going to think that you're
harassing her.

11:32.240 --> 11:34.800
Well, you know,
you could have told me she was here.

11:36.840 --> 11:38.398
Right, well, I'll call you, then.

11:38.480 --> 11:40.550
Yeah, that's great.
- Yeah.

11:40.640 --> 11:41.993
Bye.
- Bye.

11:42.080 --> 11:43.798
See you.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.479
So, anything of any interest?

11:48.560 --> 11:51.120
It looks like the divorce papers
have come through.

11:51.200 --> 11:55.159
What?
Oh, God, we never even mentioned divorce.

11:56.320 --> 11:59.596
Oh, I don't believe this.
I've only been here a week.

12:00.880 --> 12:02.836
My divorce papers.

12:02.920 --> 12:04.876
Oh, thank God for that.

12:04.960 --> 12:08.475
I mean, you know, I'm sorry, Pete.
That's terrible.

12:10.040 --> 12:11.758
Is there anything for me?

12:19.880 --> 12:21.313
Has Jane gone?

12:21.400 --> 12:24.233
Yes. Where have you been hiding?

12:24.320 --> 12:27.790
I wasn't hiding.
I was going through the adoption stuff.

12:27.880 --> 12:30.678
We've got to decide
who we want to act as our referees.

12:30.760 --> 12:33.274
Oh, yeah, that's all in hand.
Clive says he'll do it.

12:33.360 --> 12:34.759
Your boss?

12:34.840 --> 12:37.638
Yeah, he'd be perfect.
I mean, he actually is a referee.

12:37.720 --> 12:40.792
Non-league, admittedly, but still.
- I hope that's a joke.

12:43.760 --> 12:46.035
It is serious, you know.

12:46.120 --> 12:48.076
Uh, I hate that!

12:49.920 --> 12:52.195
We don't have to be serious about it.

12:52.280 --> 12:54.350
You know, we need two referees.

12:54.440 --> 12:57.591
First one's easy - Pete.
- Adam, this is not like picking a best man.

12:57.680 --> 13:00.831
If he makes a speech like at our wedding,
we'll never be approved.

13:00.920 --> 13:02.876
He won't. He knows how important this is.

13:02.960 --> 13:04.791
He's not exactly a model parent himself.

13:04.880 --> 13:07.075
His family live 3,000 miles away.

13:07.160 --> 13:09.355
He might only see his son
a couple of times a year.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.556
Well, what's that got to do with it?

13:11.640 --> 13:13.437
We're the ones doing the adopting.

13:13.520 --> 13:16.671
I mean, they need to know us,
and Pete knows us best.

13:16.760 --> 13:17.988
No.

13:21.160 --> 13:23.116
Well, you'll have to tell him.

13:23.200 --> 13:24.599
Adam!

13:24.680 --> 13:28.468
We said we'd agree
before we talked to anyone.

13:28.560 --> 13:30.835
I know, I know, it slipped out.

13:30.920 --> 13:34.595
Oh, Rach, you should have seen him
when I told him. He was so made up about it.

13:34.680 --> 13:35.908
I don't know what to say.

13:36.000 --> 13:40.391
It's like you've asked me to be godfather
for the kid or something.

13:40.480 --> 13:41.993
<i>Well, give it time.</i>

13:42.080 --> 13:45.038
Oh, I'm honoured. I really am honoured.

13:45.120 --> 13:50.148
Eh, Adam's just asked me to be
a referee for this adoption thing.

13:50.240 --> 13:51.992
Oh, you have to have a referee?

13:52.080 --> 13:53.877
You need two.

13:53.960 --> 13:55.279
Two?

13:56.920 --> 13:58.035
David?

13:58.120 --> 13:59.269
Well, I had to.

13:59.360 --> 14:02.591
For God's sake, Adam.
Do you even want to get approved?

14:02.680 --> 14:04.318
He's separated too!

14:04.400 --> 14:07.198
He had an affair
when his children were still breast-feeding.

14:07.280 --> 14:10.158
It wasn't an affair.
- They're both completely unsuitable.

14:10.240 --> 14:12.310
And, anyway, I've already asked Karen.

14:12.400 --> 14:15.870
What? Oh, well, excuse me,
Miss Holier-Than-Thou,

14:15.960 --> 14:18.679
I thought we had to discuss this first.
- Well, you didn't.

14:18.760 --> 14:20.876
Well, Karen's separated!

14:20.960 --> 14:23.030
And she drinks.
- What?

14:23.120 --> 14:26.430
She always has a bottle on the go.
I bet she was in a right state last night.

14:26.520 --> 14:27.748
Bollocks!

14:31.200 --> 14:35.113
Don't you dare criticise my friend! So she
likes to let her hair down every so often.

14:35.200 --> 14:36.918
Oh, great! Our referee, the lush.

14:37.000 --> 14:41.152
You shit! I'd pick her over your
cheating bastard friends any day.

14:41.240 --> 14:43.754
I tell you what, you're all the same.

14:47.560 --> 14:50.472
How long have you been
living with your friend now?

14:50.560 --> 14:53.279
Pete? About a fortnight.

14:53.360 --> 14:54.793
And how's that going?

14:54.880 --> 14:56.871
Well...
- Good.

14:56.960 --> 15:01.112
No, sorry, I don't mean, ''well''. I mean,
''Well...it's not going at all well.''

15:01.200 --> 15:02.997
It did at first, but...

15:03.080 --> 15:04.911
Have you filled out those divorce papers?

15:05.000 --> 15:06.956
Yes.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.678
No, you haven't.

15:08.760 --> 15:10.352
Mind your own business.

15:10.440 --> 15:12.556
I mean, every morning, it's the same.

15:15.520 --> 15:17.078
Sorry.

15:17.160 --> 15:18.752
Sorry.

15:24.120 --> 15:26.429
Well, you have to admit you're on a roll.

15:26.520 --> 15:29.034
Yeah, and I haven't even told you
about last night yet.

15:29.120 --> 15:30.553
What happened last night, Pete?

15:30.640 --> 15:32.915
Well, as usual, it started badly.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.878
We're not watching The Money Programme.
- Hey!

15:36.960 --> 15:40.635
Well, I am not watching
Pets Do The Darndest Things.

15:41.720 --> 15:43.597
Right, well, it's going off, then.

15:46.360 --> 15:48.351
Tidy up, if you like.

15:56.320 --> 15:58.072
Bollocks, let's go to the pub.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.194
Yeah.

16:01.280 --> 16:03.191
Excuse me.

16:03.280 --> 16:04.713
Here.

16:04.800 --> 16:06.313
Aye aye.

16:06.400 --> 16:07.799
Oh, Pete, no!

16:07.880 --> 16:09.199
Go on!

16:10.280 --> 16:14.910
No! Look, I'm sorry, you might be trying to
shag your wife out of your memory but I'm not.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.592
And you weren't even married to her.

16:16.680 --> 16:18.636
What?
- Forget it.

16:18.720 --> 16:22.918
Look, you don't have to do anything.
Just...just laugh at my jokes.

16:26.440 --> 16:28.749
So, how do you two know each other, then?

16:28.840 --> 16:33.960
Oh, let's see. Erm...my wife's best friend
is his best friend's wife.

16:34.040 --> 16:37.112
I see. So you're not married, then?

16:37.200 --> 16:41.273
No, he is. You see, his wife is also
a friend of his best friend.

16:42.520 --> 16:44.192
You twat!

16:44.280 --> 16:46.032
What did you have to go and say that for?

16:47.080 --> 16:48.513
It's all true.

16:48.600 --> 16:51.114
Look, sorry, Pete. I'm just a bit
out of practice.

16:51.200 --> 16:53.794
You should have told me
that's what you had in mind.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.836
I wasn't prepared.

16:55.920 --> 16:58.957
You don't have to prepare, just relax.

16:59.040 --> 17:00.996
Come on, loosen up!

17:01.080 --> 17:02.479
Be myself?

17:02.560 --> 17:05.028
Yeah! Well, not too much.

17:06.240 --> 17:10.028
He says, ''A bloke came in for a shite
the other day. It was like a breath of fresh air.''

17:12.240 --> 17:15.550
So, er...how do you two know each other?

17:17.599 --> 17:20.717
Twins? What a missed opportunity.
- Who said it was missed?

17:20.800 --> 17:22.279
Ah, no, P...

17:22.359 --> 17:23.792
Which one?

17:23.880 --> 17:25.632
The pretty one.

17:26.720 --> 17:29.518
You know what?
Tonight, I might even go for the full set.

17:29.600 --> 17:31.556
Pete Gifford, what would your mother say?

17:31.640 --> 17:33.039
''Did you wash your hands?''

17:33.120 --> 17:35.793
I bet you never thought life after Jenny
would be this good.

17:37.120 --> 17:38.678
Pints.
- Mm.

17:45.400 --> 17:47.391
Have you thought any more about David?

17:47.480 --> 17:48.833
Not now, Rach.

17:48.920 --> 17:50.672
Let's wait till we get there, eh?

17:54.040 --> 17:56.315
You know he thinks
you're going to take him back.

17:59.200 --> 18:01.350
Well, you are, aren't you?
- I don't know.

18:01.440 --> 18:04.000
I was trying to imagine my life without him.
I can't.

18:04.080 --> 18:06.196
Now I think of it with him, it just
irritates me.

18:07.480 --> 18:11.359
What are you going to do?
- I don't know. Have fun for a change, I think.

18:11.440 --> 18:14.671
Which I might - after I've done
five miles on this.

18:17.080 --> 18:19.150
Can I have a guava juice, please?

18:20.400 --> 18:22.755
Could I have a glass of Chardonnay - cold?

18:24.000 --> 18:26.070
Well...actually, we don't serve alcohol.

18:26.160 --> 18:28.879
But we do have grape juice.
- What?

18:28.960 --> 18:32.077
Well, technically, wine is grape juice.
- Yes, thank you very much.

18:32.160 --> 18:35.072
If I wanted a lecture on fine wine,
I'll ask my husband.

18:35.160 --> 18:36.878
Shall we go and get a proper drink?

18:36.960 --> 18:39.679
Well, actually, I quite fancied
that juice, so...

18:44.440 --> 18:47.238
Grape juice and make it a double.

18:49.040 --> 18:51.429
So, come on.
What's the chat with you and Adam?

18:51.520 --> 18:55.832
I gather you rowed the other day.
- Oh, God. We did.

18:55.920 --> 18:57.876
And since. This morning.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.551
So we have to say what kind of child
we would be prepared to adopt.

19:03.640 --> 19:07.315
For instance, a child who's been abandoned.
- Yep.

19:07.400 --> 19:09.152
Neglected.
- Yes.

19:09.240 --> 19:11.470
Born as a result of rape or incest.

19:15.800 --> 19:18.268
A child with specific medical needs.

19:18.360 --> 19:20.351
A child with unclear medical prognosis.

19:20.440 --> 19:23.671
A child who is visually impaired or blind.
- Hang on, hang on. Hang on.

19:25.320 --> 19:26.958
I'm not sure about blind.

19:27.040 --> 19:29.235
Why not?

19:29.320 --> 19:32.517
Bringing up a child that's blind
would be hard work. I'm not sure.

19:33.600 --> 19:37.593
I'm sorry.
I didn't know this was meant to be a picnic.

19:38.680 --> 19:40.750
You know I don't mean it like that.

19:42.840 --> 19:44.558
How about visually impaired?

19:44.640 --> 19:46.596
Well, how bad?

19:46.680 --> 19:48.636
I don't know.

19:48.720 --> 19:50.711
Can't see the wood for the trees.

19:50.800 --> 19:54.110
Blind in the left eye. Or would you be
prepared to accept the right?

19:54.200 --> 19:57.909
Oh, hold on, Rach. There's a corker here.
Child with facial disfigurement.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.912
I suppose it depends how ugly they are.
- I'm being realistic.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.513
You're trying to be selfish.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.158
Who are we doing this for?
- For us.

20:04.240 --> 20:08.074
Precisely! Which is exactly why we should
accept whoever they place with us.

20:08.160 --> 20:09.991
That is ridiculous.

20:10.080 --> 20:11.991
Right. What do you want me to write?

20:12.080 --> 20:15.390
Dear Sir, Can we have a nice, white,
middle-class child who is no trouble?

20:15.480 --> 20:16.833
Preferably English.

20:16.920 --> 20:19.559
Think about it. Think about it.
- What?

20:20.480 --> 20:25.349
Could we really cope with a child that's
got Down's syndrome or cystic fibrosis?

20:28.200 --> 20:30.430
Look it up if you don't know what I mean.

20:30.520 --> 20:35.036
But don't treat this like some kind of pub quiz
where you get points for giving right answers.

20:35.120 --> 20:37.156
I'm not doing that.

20:37.240 --> 20:42.758
Adam, it's our lives we're talking about.
It's not just the child's. It's our lives.

20:42.840 --> 20:46.958
Do you really want to be a carer
for the rest of your life?

20:47.040 --> 20:48.758
Think about it.

20:56.160 --> 20:57.673
So, where is Adam now, then?

20:58.760 --> 21:00.830
I don't know and I don't care.

21:00.920 --> 21:03.150
<i>All we seem to do is argue at the minute.</i>

21:03.240 --> 21:05.959
It's all down to this bloody adoption thing.

21:07.040 --> 21:10.350
I'd give you a hug, only I don't want
you to take it the wrong way.

21:16.120 --> 21:19.317
Jenny. That's who I used to tell
all my problems to.

21:19.400 --> 21:21.391
Now she's on the other side of the Atlantic.

21:22.440 --> 21:24.635
It's OK. I mean, it's a difficult time.

21:24.720 --> 21:26.676
Especially if you're not sure.

21:30.320 --> 21:33.517
Hey, do you remember that time in Donegal?

21:34.560 --> 21:37.393
Remember? I've been trying to forget.

21:39.720 --> 21:41.676
It's all right. I'll get it.

21:43.960 --> 21:45.439
Hello.

21:45.520 --> 21:47.431
Oh, hi, Karen. Yeah, he's right here.

21:48.520 --> 21:49.999
What?

21:52.000 --> 21:55.037
Oh. Yeah. Sure. Sure.

21:55.120 --> 21:56.553
Yeah, I suppose so.

21:57.920 --> 21:59.876
Erm...yeah, that's fine.

22:00.920 --> 22:03.195
OK. Yeah. Yeah. What time?

22:03.280 --> 22:04.872
Yeah, OK. All right.

22:04.960 --> 22:06.473
See you. Bye. Thanks.

22:08.640 --> 22:11.359
Didn't she want to speak to me?
- Oh, sorry, I never asked.

22:11.440 --> 22:12.873
What was all that about, then?

22:12.960 --> 22:16.077
Erm...she's asked me to go for a drink.
You don't mind, do you?

22:24.320 --> 22:27.039
Yep. Oh, hiya. Yeah.

22:29.760 --> 22:31.159
Oh, right. Yeah.

22:31.240 --> 22:32.719
Karen.

22:35.600 --> 22:37.477
Hello.

22:37.560 --> 22:39.278
Yes.

22:40.840 --> 22:42.637
Baby-sitting?

22:42.720 --> 22:44.312
Yes, I suppose I could.

22:46.480 --> 22:48.357
So, what time do you want me?

22:57.520 --> 22:58.839
Bloody hell.

22:58.920 --> 23:01.434
<i>We'll never get in.
- Leave it to me.</i>

23:01.520 --> 23:03.112
Karen, we're not members.

23:03.200 --> 23:05.555
Just look enigmatic.

23:13.240 --> 23:15.196
How did you do that?

23:15.280 --> 23:17.874
I told them you were a film star.

23:17.960 --> 23:19.552
And he recognised me?

23:19.640 --> 23:21.835
He doesn't watch those kind of films!

23:37.960 --> 23:39.916
Daddy?
- Yes, Joshy.

23:40.960 --> 23:43.793
Can you come and see me play tomorrow?

23:43.880 --> 23:45.836
Course I will, darling.

24:10.960 --> 24:12.916
It's the only way to fly.

24:14.400 --> 24:17.073
I'm going to go and make some shapes.
- Eh?

24:24.800 --> 24:26.916
Yours, I believe.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.479
Oh, cheers.

24:28.560 --> 24:30.312
Who was that?

24:31.840 --> 24:33.831
I've no idea.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.072
Rach, can we talk?

24:46.560 --> 24:48.516
Come on, Rach. This is silly.

24:48.600 --> 24:50.795
Look, Rach, will you open the door?

24:50.880 --> 24:52.757
Hello.

24:52.840 --> 24:55.752
What?

24:59.960 --> 25:02.474
I think we should ask Pete
and Karen to be our referees.

25:02.560 --> 25:05.552
There's nothing wrong with them.
- What about David?

25:05.640 --> 25:07.596
I'll talk to him. He'll be fine.

25:08.720 --> 25:11.712
I'm sorry I've been a bit sharp
with you recently.

25:11.800 --> 25:14.598
Hey, six of you, half a baker's dozen of me.

25:17.320 --> 25:18.878
Do you need a bath?

25:18.960 --> 25:20.518
I do need a bath, actually.

25:23.640 --> 25:26.313
Erm...you're right, you know.

25:26.500 --> 25:32.430
I should be more realistic about...
children with disabilities and so on.

25:32.520 --> 25:35.432
You think?
- Yeah.

25:36.520 --> 25:38.476
Why make it harder on ourselves?

25:38.560 --> 25:41.233
It's gonna be tough enough anyway, you know.

25:41.320 --> 25:42.594
Well, yeah.

25:43.840 --> 25:45.239
That's what Jane said.

25:46.880 --> 25:48.074
Jane?

25:48.160 --> 25:49.752
Has she rung?

25:50.960 --> 25:52.598
N-No. I met her for a drink.

25:52.680 --> 25:53.999
You didn't tell me.

25:54.080 --> 25:57.789
You didn't tell me
you were taking her to Karen's party.

25:57.880 --> 25:59.791
That's slightly different.

25:59.880 --> 26:01.757
It was just a drink.

26:01.840 --> 26:04.274
Which you didn't mention to me.

26:04.360 --> 26:05.713
Because it was unimportant.

26:05.800 --> 26:07.791
In which case, why didn't you
mention it to me?

26:07.880 --> 26:10.348
I'm sorry, have I done something wrong here?

26:10.440 --> 26:13.113
I don't know, but you're acting
very strangely.

26:13.200 --> 26:14.599
Oh, come on.

26:14.680 --> 26:16.830
Adam, why didn't you invite me?

26:16.920 --> 26:18.478
Because we had a row.

26:18.560 --> 26:20.118
Right.

26:20.200 --> 26:26.230
So, we have a row and you run to your...
ex-girlfriend for a shoulder to cry on.

26:26.320 --> 26:27.673
No!

26:30.040 --> 26:31.519
Where are you going?

26:32.600 --> 26:34.556
I've already had my bath.

26:42.040 --> 26:43.393
<i>Funny that, wasn't it?</i>

26:43.480 --> 26:46.870
<i>Yeah, it was very funny.
- Do you want a drink or what?</i>

26:46.960 --> 26:49.315
No, thanks.
- Come on, have a drink.

26:49.400 --> 26:50.833
<i>No, really. Thank you.</i>

26:52.720 --> 26:54.597
Hey, baby!

26:54.680 --> 26:56.591
Do you know where the loos are?

26:56.680 --> 26:58.318
I'm absolutely busting...

27:04.840 --> 27:06.796
I'm really sorry, Pete!

27:06.880 --> 27:08.632
No! No, thanks!

27:08.720 --> 27:10.597
Tosser. Do you want another drink?

27:10.680 --> 27:14.036
Yeah. But can I have a beer this time?
I'm trying to cut down on salt.

27:14.120 --> 27:16.315
Hey, loos are back there.
- Right.

27:41.320 --> 27:42.673
He said, ''I'm a welder.''

27:49.160 --> 27:50.957
Hiya, baby.

27:54.040 --> 27:56.838
Pete, what the hell are you doing?
- What?

27:58.600 --> 28:01.398
This is Rick. He owns the bar.

28:01.480 --> 28:03.357
This is Pete, a friend of mine.

28:03.440 --> 28:05.590
How are you doing?
- Good.

28:05.680 --> 28:07.636
I'm...I'm sorry. Sorry.

28:08.640 --> 28:09.868
Sorry.

28:10.600 --> 28:12.238
Does he always greet you like that?

28:12.960 --> 28:14.837
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

28:14.920 --> 28:16.319
Thanks.

28:21.800 --> 28:22.949
Karen?

28:24.000 --> 28:25.718
David, you're still here?

28:25.800 --> 28:27.756
Oh, hi, Ramona.

28:27.840 --> 28:31.116
Yes, Karen's not back yet.
- It's very late.

28:31.200 --> 28:33.270
If you want, I can take over
and you can go home.

28:33.360 --> 28:35.715
I mean...back to Pete's.

28:38.480 --> 28:39.833
Well, if you're sure.

28:39.920 --> 28:41.592
Yeah. Of course.

28:41.680 --> 28:43.636
Oh, thanks, Ramona.
- That's OK.

28:53.440 --> 28:56.591
<i>So, Pete, I was telling you
about my holiday, wasn't I, eh?</i>

28:56.680 --> 28:59.717
Went skiing. Have you been skiing?
- No. No.

28:59.800 --> 29:05.477
<i>No? I tell you, you would find it brilliant.
It's fantastic. Found this little bar, rlight?</i>

29:05.560 --> 29:08.028
They had these little shots...
- Excuse me, love.

29:08.120 --> 29:09.599
Yeah. Oh.

29:16.840 --> 29:18.034
Hey!

29:19.080 --> 29:20.069
Hey!

29:20.160 --> 29:23.755
Look... I thought I'd call us both a cab.

29:24.800 --> 29:27.553
Won't your date mind?

29:27.640 --> 29:29.358
Come on.

29:29.440 --> 29:31.317
It's not like that.
- Yeah, right.

29:32.400 --> 29:34.516
It's all right. You go on.

29:34.600 --> 29:35.828
No, no, no.

29:35.920 --> 29:37.558
Look, it's fine. I'll stay here.

29:37.640 --> 29:39.198
Pete!

29:39.280 --> 29:42.192
Go home!

29:43.280 --> 29:45.794
Karen, I am David's friend.

29:45.880 --> 29:48.189
You're like the police!

29:48.280 --> 29:51.556
Aren't I allowed to go out on my own?

29:51.640 --> 29:54.359
Not if you're gonna do something
you'll regret!

29:54.440 --> 29:59.958
It's a bit late for you to start
getting moral, mate.

30:04.400 --> 30:05.628
<i>Hello.</i>

30:07.280 --> 30:09.032
This man bothering you?

30:10.880 --> 30:12.279
Yes.

30:18.840 --> 30:20.558
For you.

30:22.160 --> 30:24.355
You happy?
- Yeah.

30:24.440 --> 30:26.874
Can we go somewhere else?

30:26.960 --> 30:28.951
Sure.

31:22.200 --> 31:23.952
Have you had a good time?

31:29.120 --> 31:30.553
Get off.

31:31.880 --> 31:35.350
Is that your car?

31:35.440 --> 31:37.396
Hey, you turn me on.

31:38.960 --> 31:40.473
Oh, get off.

31:40.560 --> 31:42.073
I said get off!

31:53.240 --> 31:54.832
Get off!

31:54.920 --> 31:57.593
You know, if I really wanted to...

31:57.680 --> 31:59.750
but right now...

31:59.840 --> 32:01.717
you're not in the least bit attractive.

32:26.640 --> 32:28.198
<i>Oh, God.</i>

32:30.520 --> 32:33.114
<i>Good morning. Jennifer Lopez...</i>

32:37.160 --> 32:40.470
I thought I heard you up.
So, how was last night?

32:40.560 --> 32:42.551
Did Karen have a good time?

32:42.640 --> 32:45.200
Yeah. You know.

32:48.080 --> 32:50.992
Right... Mind, if I use the bathroom?

33:06.280 --> 33:07.759
Don't put it back.

33:10.160 --> 33:12.116
Buy it for me.

33:12.200 --> 33:14.270
You know it's my favourite album.

33:14.360 --> 33:16.316
Our favourite album.

33:21.080 --> 33:23.036
When did you last buy me a CD?

33:23.120 --> 33:25.076
What's going on here, Adam?

33:25.880 --> 33:29.156
You said that Jane was history.
Nothing special.

33:29.240 --> 33:33.358
If you're going to buy all your exes CDs, I think
we're gonna have to start making cutbacks.

33:35.280 --> 33:37.271
<i>That's right. Put it back, Adam.</i>

33:37.360 --> 33:38.918
Oh, leave the guy alone.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.877
All the time it's nag, nag, nag.

33:40.960 --> 33:43.076
No wonder he'd rather be with me than you.

33:43.160 --> 33:44.878
Rubbish!

33:44.960 --> 33:47.918
I'm the love of his life. I can give
him children.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.514
You can't. You just give him grief.

33:50.600 --> 33:52.431
We love each other.

33:52.520 --> 33:56.672
He doesn't love you. You're
just...nostalgia.

33:56.760 --> 33:58.990
Put the CD back, Adam.

33:59.080 --> 34:01.275
Buy it for me, Adam.
- Put it back.

34:01.360 --> 34:03.396
Buy it.
- Put it back.

34:03.480 --> 34:04.674
Buy it, Adam. Please.

34:04.760 --> 34:06.557
Put it back.
- Buy it, Adam.

34:06.640 --> 34:08.152
Girls, will you just shut up?

34:19.960 --> 34:22.030
So, did you have fun last night...

34:24.120 --> 34:25.678
...with Pete?

34:25.760 --> 34:27.351
Yeah, thanks.

34:28.440 --> 34:30.112
Why? Did he say anything?

34:30.199 --> 34:31.871
He said you had a good time.

34:33.440 --> 34:37.956
Not now, Josh, please.
Just wait till we get inside. Sh! Go on. Go.

34:51.639 --> 34:53.915
Hiya.
- Hey.

34:57.120 --> 34:59.076
For you.

34:59.160 --> 35:02.277
You old romantic.

35:02.360 --> 35:05.830
God, I've not heard this in years.
Not since... - Donegal.

35:05.920 --> 35:07.876
Yeah.

35:07.960 --> 35:09.473
Thank you.

35:13.360 --> 35:15.920
I think it's best if we didn't see
each other again.

36:08.560 --> 36:10.516
Awful, isn't it?
- God, yes.

36:15.920 --> 36:18.388
Tell me you're not in love with me.

36:18.480 --> 36:21.199
Oh, I don't know. What is love?

36:21.280 --> 36:25.990
Yes, I am not in love with you.
- You're lying, Adam, to yourself as well as me.

36:26.080 --> 36:29.834
Jane...I will always love you.

36:30.880 --> 36:32.996
You were first.

36:33.080 --> 36:36.311
But that was a long time ago.
If we hadn't met again in Ireland...

36:36.400 --> 36:39.039
But we did. And what happened then was...

36:39.120 --> 36:40.348
A mistake.

36:40.440 --> 36:42.476
Nothing has changed.
- Of course it has!

36:42.560 --> 36:44.118
It was my stag do, for God's sake!

36:44.200 --> 36:48.034
I know you feel for Rachel and you don't
want to hurt her. She's a great girl.

36:48.120 --> 36:51.749
God, it's better to do it now than
six months down the line, a year, whatever.

36:51.840 --> 36:53.239
I love Rachel.

36:53.320 --> 36:54.514
I love you.

36:54.600 --> 36:56.192
I choose her.

36:58.640 --> 37:00.596
And you think you have that choice?

37:01.680 --> 37:05.229
Do you think if she knew about me
that you'd have that luxury?

37:05.320 --> 37:07.038
You wouldn't tell her.

37:07.120 --> 37:09.634
Isn't that what you want me
to do, deep down?

37:09.720 --> 37:10.789
No!

37:10.880 --> 37:13.872
Force the issue.
- No. Jane, for me, please, don't.

37:13.960 --> 37:15.837
I'd do it for you.

37:17.120 --> 37:22.558
I know you, Adam.
You love me, I love you. It's in your eyes.

37:22.640 --> 37:27.760
That is why I gave up everything.
That's why I gave up Ireland for you.

37:27.840 --> 37:30.912
And that is why you must give up
Rachel for me.

37:33.880 --> 37:35.359
Leave us allone.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.958
Well, that seemed to go
pretty well, didn't it?

37:53.040 --> 37:54.951
It was awful.

37:55.040 --> 37:57.759
But you were excellent, Josh.
Wasn't he, David?

37:57.840 --> 37:59.193
Yes, you were, Joshy.

37:59.280 --> 38:00.633
Easily the best.

38:00.720 --> 38:03.678
Actually, I didn't mean the concert,
I meant us.

38:03.760 --> 38:05.955
David, this is not a good time
to be talking...

38:06.040 --> 38:08.076
You must admit...
- David, just leave it!

38:08.160 --> 38:09.149
Watch out!

38:11.320 --> 38:13.550
Shit!
- Why weren't you looking?!

38:13.640 --> 38:16.552
You distracted me! David!

38:16.640 --> 38:17.755
Shit! Shit! Shit!

38:21.840 --> 38:24.354
Is there any damage?
- Of course there is.

38:27.080 --> 38:30.629
Oh, no. No! No! Oh, no!

38:31.680 --> 38:33.352
Oh, wonderful.

38:33.440 --> 38:35.715
David. David.

38:35.800 --> 38:38.997
David, I think I'm over the limit.
- You only had a couple of glasses.

38:39.080 --> 38:40.832
Three.

38:40.920 --> 38:42.990
And I had a drink before I came out.

38:44.720 --> 38:46.676
What?
- I was dreading it!

38:46.760 --> 38:48.990
David, please, will you say you
were driving?

38:49.080 --> 38:50.513
Josh, stay on the pavement.

38:50.600 --> 38:53.239
Sir. Madam. What's happened here?

38:55.640 --> 38:57.756
Um...we've had a slight accident.

38:59.600 --> 39:03.593
It was all my fault, officer.
We had a bit of a row.

39:05.240 --> 39:08.915
And...I took my eyes off the road.
- And you were driving, were you, sir?

39:09.000 --> 39:11.150
Absolutely, officer.

39:11.240 --> 39:13.117
This your son, sir?
- Yes.

39:13.200 --> 39:15.236
Do you mind if I have a word?
- No, of course.

39:18.640 --> 39:21.916
So what's your name, young man?
- Josh.

39:22.000 --> 39:27.074
Tell me, Josh, who was driving the car -
your daddy or your mummy?

39:29.640 --> 39:31.392
Daddy.

39:35.160 --> 39:39.039
All right, we'll still have to do a breath
test, sir. Step over to the car, please.

39:39.120 --> 39:40.872
Certainly.

39:57.200 --> 40:00.158
You always do this.
- I haven't for aeons.

40:00.240 --> 40:02.959
No, I mean make up
when it's me who's at fault.

40:09.800 --> 40:12.189
Was it on offer?
- Two for 22 quid.

40:12.280 --> 40:13.952
What else did you get?

40:15.040 --> 40:16.439
I was joking.

40:18.640 --> 40:21.234
I'll put these in water.
- I'll put this on.

40:28.360 --> 40:30.715
Here, you'd better drive.

40:30.800 --> 40:32.756
How could you do that?

40:34.280 --> 40:37.556
Get behind the wheel of the car
when you knew you were over the limit.

40:37.640 --> 40:39.153
Didn't you think of Josh?

40:39.240 --> 40:43.995
It was an outrageous thing to do,
to put your family's life at risk!

40:44.080 --> 40:46.878
You're way out of control, Karen,
you know that?

40:46.960 --> 40:49.918
I have no idea what it is you want.
Do you want a divorce?

40:50.000 --> 40:51.718
Do you want a custody battle?

40:51.800 --> 40:56.794
Cos I'm telling you this, Karen, I am not going
to let my family be driven around by a drunk!

40:59.240 --> 41:00.798
Get in the car.

41:11.960 --> 41:14.679
Cheers.
- I'll look for a flat in the morning.

41:14.760 --> 41:16.591
It's not that bad yet.

41:17.640 --> 41:20.279
You can always leave it till the day after.

41:20.360 --> 41:22.191
I've told you, you can stay with me.

41:22.280 --> 41:24.077
No, I meant long-term.

41:24.160 --> 41:27.516
You'll sort it.
You and Karen are meant for each other.

41:27.600 --> 41:29.192
No, no, no.
- Look, you are!

41:29.280 --> 41:32.078
They've given me tofu! I said no tofu!

41:38.600 --> 41:42.070
<i>You have three messages. Message One.</i>

41:42.160 --> 41:43.513
<i>David, it's me.</i>

41:43.600 --> 41:48.879
<i>Listen, I'm really sorry about what happened
earlier. It was really irresponsible of me.</i>

41:49.960 --> 41:53.748
<i>Anyway, just to prove to you
that I do not have a drink problem,</i>

41:53.840 --> 41:58.868
<i>I'm going to pour myself a glass of wine
and I'm not going to touch it all evening.</i>

42:01.320 --> 42:04.437
<i>And I'm sure you'd agree
that if I did have a drink problem,</i>

42:04.520 --> 42:07.751
<i>or, as you so eloquently put it,
if I were a drunk,</i>

42:07.840 --> 42:11.833
<i>that I would not be able to exercise
this degree of self-control.</i>

42:16.080 --> 42:18.355
<i>I'll call you in the morning.</i>

42:18.440 --> 42:20.158
<i>Sober.</i>

42:50.160 --> 42:52.515
<i>I couldn't do it, Pete. I had to
have a drink.</i>

42:52.600 --> 42:54.556
David's right, Pete.

42:55.640 --> 42:57.312
I think I might be an alcoholic.

42:58.400 --> 43:00.630
One drink does not make you an alcoholic.

43:02.600 --> 43:04.556
Would you like a cup of tea?

43:08.120 --> 43:09.997
Anyway, I'm going to go and see a shrink.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.355
Don't suppose you know any good therapists,
do you?

43:15.880 --> 43:17.552
Hang on.

43:18.880 --> 43:20.518
There you go.

43:21.720 --> 43:23.836
Be my guest.

43:23.920 --> 43:25.990
Do you see a therapist?

43:26.080 --> 43:28.310
Come on! I'm not nuts.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.752
Neither are you.

43:35.680 --> 43:37.432
No, I found it down the side of the sofa.

43:37.520 --> 43:39.715
Must have slipped down there, I suppose.

43:39.800 --> 43:41.756
A Freudian slip!

43:43.360 --> 43:45.430
Sorry.

43:46.800 --> 43:48.392
I wonder whose it is.

43:48.480 --> 43:54.112
Well, to be honest...there's been quite a few
women round here in the last fortnight,

43:54.200 --> 43:58.398
and I don't want to sound harsh,
but it could be any one of theirs.

44:00.320 --> 44:02.595
That's awful.

44:02.680 --> 44:04.636
That is awful.

44:04.720 --> 44:07.678
Look at the state of us, Pete,
for God's sake.

44:07.760 --> 44:10.228
Out every night,
pretending we're having a good time.

44:10.320 --> 44:13.118
How sad is that? How sad...is that?

44:15.840 --> 44:17.751
What kind of life's that?

44:21.320 --> 44:24.835
Next time you do a shopping list,
can you put all the vegetables together?

44:24.920 --> 44:28.117
What is the point being married
to an idiot...

44:29.600 --> 44:31.079
Oh, my God!

44:38.280 --> 44:39.679
What are you doing here?

44:39.760 --> 44:42.194
What? Adam!
- You bitch.

44:42.280 --> 44:45.397
Is that what you think of me?
- Whatever she's told you, it's not true.

44:45.480 --> 44:47.948
OK, my stag weekend, I spent
the night with her.

44:48.040 --> 44:50.315
I did not sleep with her and, Jane,
I do not love you!

44:50.400 --> 44:51.799
What?

44:53.560 --> 44:55.312
I came to say goodbye.

44:55.400 --> 44:57.755
I'm going back to Ireland.

45:00.560 --> 45:02.278
I didn't say a word.

45:03.880 --> 45:05.233
I wouldn't.

45:05.320 --> 45:06.912
God, I love you too much for that.

45:10.080 --> 45:11.798
Rachel, I am so sorry.

45:14.160 --> 45:17.994
And I am so sad that you have
such a low opinion of me. Excuse me.

45:47.080 --> 45:50.959
Hi. Can I make an appointment
to see Mr Campbell, please?

45:51.040 --> 45:52.951
Could we make it next Thursday?
- Yes.

45:53.040 --> 45:55.270
David?

45:55.360 --> 45:57.237
Karen.

45:57.320 --> 46:00.596
What are you doing here?
- I was visiting a client.

46:00.680 --> 46:02.796
Mr Campbell.
- Yeah, right, David.

46:02.880 --> 46:04.598
<i>I'm Mr Campbell.</i>

46:04.680 --> 46:06.636
My therapist.

46:08.080 --> 46:09.798
This is Karen, my wife.

46:09.880 --> 46:11.598
Nice to meet you.

46:11.680 --> 46:13.398
David has mentioned you.

46:15.720 --> 46:18.757
I had no idea.
- I'm sorry. I thought it would help.

46:18.840 --> 46:21.308
No, David, I think that's fantastic.

46:21.400 --> 46:23.118
You do?

46:24.840 --> 46:26.512
<i>David, I need help.</i>

46:27.600 --> 46:29.556
<i>I really need some help.</i>

46:31.040 --> 46:34.510
<i>David, I need help really badly.</i>

46:43.720 --> 46:45.233
I'm sorry.

46:45.320 --> 46:46.753
I'm sorry.

46:47.800 --> 46:49.199
I'm sorry.

46:52.000 --> 46:55.197
David, please will you come to lunch
on Sunday?

46:55.280 --> 46:57.589
I'd love to. And the children would like it.

46:59.160 --> 47:01.230
No, David, I'd really like it.

47:01.320 --> 47:03.276
I'd really like it.

47:09.680 --> 47:13.434
Don't suppose you do
a family discount, do you?
