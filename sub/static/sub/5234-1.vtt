Hey.

01:32.493 --> 01:34.293
He stole
my fucking watch.

01:34.295 --> 01:36.328
It's too late
to be calling, Andie.
What?

01:36.796 --> 01:38.864
The guy that I met
at the Hairy Lemon.
We had sex,

01:38.866 --> 01:41.767
he stole my watch,
which cost more than
his fucking car.

01:42.168 --> 01:44.636
Um, I think I have your watch.

01:45.505 --> 01:46.572
What?

01:46.574 --> 01:48.774
You left it here

it's my Dad's.
I don't give a shit.

I'll talk
to you tomorrow.
ANDIE:  <i>No. Wait.</i>

02:39.425 --> 02:41.860
I got the gross
zucchini kind you like.

02:43.930 --> 02:46.165
You know, I had a friend
who went through
eight rounds of IVF

02:46.167 --> 02:47.533
before she got pregnant.

02:48.469 --> 02:52.838
Okay, maybe
it wasn't eight.
It was more like two.

02:52.840 --> 02:53.906
What are you
talking about?

02:55.208 --> 02:57.309
We should probably
get going.

I can't believe
you're in therapy.

I just don't understand
why you have to tell her
everything.

03:09.423 --> 03:12.291
I don't
tell her everything.

03:12.293 --> 03:14.459
Well, she knows
we're doing
another round of IVF,

03:14.461 --> 03:15.928
which, by the way,
was news to me.

03:16.330 --> 03:19.264
I mean, how are we
even gonna pay for it?

03:19.266 --> 03:20.933
We couldn't afford it
the last three times.

03:20.935 --> 03:23.635
Well, I could do
some more tutoring.

03:23.637 --> 03:25.837

covers groceries.

You know, you don't
have to drive such an
expensive car, Peter.

03:32.780 --> 03:35.681
Well, I have
an image to present
to my clients.

03:36.683 --> 03:37.816
Okay.

03:37.818 --> 03:42.721
I have said from the start
that I would always
be straight with you both.

03:42.723 --> 03:45.390
And I'm willing
to stroke the shaft,

03:45.392 --> 03:47.826
but I'm not gonna
cradle the balls.

03:49.295 --> 03:51.730
Because, the thing is,
this is, um...

03:53.233 --> 03:54.366
This is boring.

03:54.368 --> 03:57.903
Yeah. Really,
I've been watching
the two of you.

03:57.905 --> 04:00.906
You're drowning in the sea
of boring bullshit,

04:01.274 --> 04:02.908
and I am choking
on the fumes.

04:02.910 --> 04:06.011
I mean, you have been coming
in here, I don't know, maybe,

04:06.013 --> 04:07.713
well, over a year,

04:07.715 --> 04:10.015
and I don't think any of us
have really said anything.

04:10.717 --> 04:13.252
It's like
we're talking about
the weather every week.

04:13.254 --> 04:17.956

It's always sunny.
Nobody gives a fuck.

04:17.958 --> 04:20.726

on something else.

Thank you,
Dr. Grayson,
thank you.

04:30.770 --> 04:33.005

was a professor of botany,
and he...

04:33.007 --> 04:36.441
You can tell he took care
of his garden,
and rightfully so,

04:36.443 --> 04:38.777
considering
the beautiful vista.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.679
You would probably spend
a lot of time back here.

Now this...
No, you don't want
to get wet?

04:43.684 --> 04:48.353
Hi. This house just
went on the market,
and considering its beauty,

04:48.488 --> 04:50.956
it is probably gonna go
pretty fast.

26:52.144 --> 26:54.645
Use your words,
sweetheart.

26:54.647 --> 26:55.879
God! "Use your words"?

26:55.881 --> 26:58.382
That is so fucking
patronizing.

Don't you ever say that
to this kid, Lizzie.

if you count
the guest-house.

Banister you're holding onto,
recently reinforced.

27:19.371 --> 27:20.938
Brand new,
as a matter of fact.

27:21.640 --> 27:25.109
Now, my favorite spot
in the entire house.

27:26.044 --> 27:27.778
You'll immediately see why.

27:28.113 --> 27:31.215
Because, the view,
which is so spectacular,

27:31.217 --> 27:32.950
takes in most of...
Yeah, no, it's...

27:33.084 --> 27:34.251
It's too white.

27:35.220 --> 27:36.720
Too white, right.

27:36.855 --> 27:39.223
Well, you could paint it.

27:39.225 --> 27:41.659
Yeah, you know what?
I actually
can't even be here anymore.

27:41.661 --> 27:43.060
It's burning out my retina.

27:43.062 --> 27:44.228

27:44.230 --> 27:45.729
Right.
We got vertigo.

Wow. Vertigo.

Okay, Pete.

27:50.335 --> 27:52.770

can only really...
Yep.

27:52.971 --> 27:56.674
You know, be appreciated
when you look at it.

28:14.125 --> 28:16.193
I'm sporting baby trout
right now.

28:16.327 --> 28:18.362
I need a house
that's gonna make me hard.

28:34.979 --> 28:36.413
Aren't they beauteous?

28:36.415 --> 28:37.981
It looks like
an engorged scrotum.

28:37.983 --> 28:39.283
Yeah? Look at that.

28:39.285 --> 28:41.819
Wow.
That looks like a good time.

28:42.821 --> 28:45.355
Lizzie, do you have any
interviews lined up?

28:45.357 --> 28:47.391
Uh, no, not yet.

28:49.160 --> 28:51.061
We're not gonna make
our mortgage this month.

28:53.765 --> 28:55.432
Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.

28:56.367 --> 28:57.901
I could start
selling drugs again.

How much
do you need?

29:01.206 --> 29:03.006
I could ask my Dad.
Casey, don't get her
riled up.

29:03.174 --> 29:04.775
All right?
Come on. Yeah.

29:04.777 --> 29:05.909
Seriously,
I can make a call.

29:05.911 --> 29:07.211
No, that's okay. Thanks.

Joyce, where's that ball?

29:09.081 --> 29:10.914
Oh! That's a good dog.
Casey, outside!

is going on
in this house?

Get it.

29:17.356 --> 29:19.123
(LAUGHING)
Get it.

29:29.267 --> 29:31.235
Hey, sweetie.
Mmm.

29:31.237 --> 29:32.936
Will you sing for me?

29:36.107 --> 29:37.374
Not tonight, hon.

29:38.510 --> 29:39.943
I'm really tired.

29:43.515 --> 29:44.882
Okay.

29:52.357 --> 29:53.557
I love you.

29:55.059 --> 29:56.393
Love you, too.

30:01.499 --> 30:03.100
You know what?

30:03.102 --> 30:04.968
I think we should just
go with Vanilla Dream. Hmm?

30:05.436 --> 30:07.871
Mmm. Sounds like
a porno color.

30:12.210 --> 30:14.545
Honey, do you like
this color for
the baby's room?

30:14.547 --> 30:15.879
Where's Casey?

30:16.581 --> 30:18.048
Uh.

30:18.183 --> 30:20.150
I don't know.
He said he'd be back later.

30:20.485 --> 30:22.452
Great.
He's probably with a girl.

30:22.454 --> 30:26.456
You know, he's supposed to
keep his dick in his pants
for the first year,

30:26.458 --> 30:30.327
Honey, he might
have just gone
to a meeting.

30:30.995 --> 30:32.863
Whatever.
I'm gonna take a shower.

30:34.566 --> 30:35.999
Peter?

30:36.001 --> 30:40.337
Don't you think it's time
we just told him
what's going on?

30:40.339 --> 30:42.372
I mean, Andie's gonna
start showing soon.

30:42.374 --> 30:45.242
Okay, I, I am
gonna tell him, but
when the time is right.

30:45.410 --> 30:47.010
PETER:
I just don't want to
make him feel like

30:47.012 --> 30:48.445
a bigger loser
than he already is.

30:48.447 --> 30:51.215
Peter!
Than he already feels like,
that's what I meant.

30:52.016 --> 30:53.517
I feel like
I'm having a boy.

30:55.153 --> 30:56.420
I hope he's gay.

30:58.289 --> 30:59.389
Why?

30:59.391 --> 31:02.159
Well, then when we dress
him up as a doll,

31:02.161 --> 31:03.627
he won't be an asshole
about it.

31:03.962 --> 31:05.195
(GIGGLES)

31:05.197 --> 31:06.430
PETER: Hey.

31:06.432 --> 31:07.931
We're not dressing him up
like a doll.

31:07.933 --> 31:09.299
He's not gonna be gay.

31:09.301 --> 31:11.501
What if he is gay, Peter?

31:11.636 --> 31:13.036
You're not gonna
love him then?

31:13.439 --> 31:19.142
But I might be
and he might wind up
being a butt pirate,

31:19.144 --> 31:21.044
so you need to
fucking come to terms
with that.

31:21.046 --> 31:22.446
Why are we
even talking about it?

31:22.448 --> 31:24.348

does that mean?

31:32.523 --> 31:33.924
Lizzie, where are you going?

31:34.192 --> 31:36.059
I'm just gonna go
do some gardening.

31:54.479 --> 31:56.146
I know
what you're gonna say.

31:57.548 --> 32:00.450
I need you
to get the threats
under control.

32:01.653 --> 32:03.053

I can't help it.

did I wake you?

I'm sorry.

32:31.049 --> 32:32.282
It's okay.

you could ask Andie
for a loan?

hiding anywhere,
let me know.

same time next week, right?

33:15.994 --> 33:19.129
do you have any friends
who might need tutoring?

I don't know.
Well, could you ask?

Because I can teach
English and Math, too.

Nothing!
Just forget it, okay?

50:53.117 --> 50:55.151
See,
you always do that.
I do what?

50:55.153 --> 50:56.419
You shut down.

50:56.421 --> 51:01.190

to me when I feel like
I'm being ganged up on.

51:01.192 --> 51:02.825

ganging up on you.

51:03.393 --> 51:05.161
That's how it feels.

All right,
no one can make
you feel anything, Lizzie.

such bullshit.

look like it right now,

just had a breakdown.

So why don't we play it...

Why don't we just
play it by ear?

she was so full of rage.
Hmm.

Oh, it's always been there.
It's just been
buried deep down.

goddamned right!

Yeah?

53:14.958 --> 53:16.458
What were yours?

53:51.962 --> 53:53.395
It's just,
I think it's just the latch,
you know.

53:53.397 --> 53:55.664
Yes.
You just do that
and it just closes.

53:55.800 --> 53:59.802
because, look,
see, it's bent
and doesn't close.

54:02.539 --> 54:04.707

and sucker me,
all right?

this is broken.

01:05:51.113 --> 01:05:52.414

PETER: I can barely see
anything. Maybe
we should call it a night.

01:06:51.073 --> 01:06:52.374
I wanna keep looking.

01:06:53.342 --> 01:06:55.377
Lizzie,
someone will see her tags.

01:06:56.178 --> 01:06:58.279
Okay, I'm, I'm gonna
keep looking.

01:07:01.184 --> 01:07:05.653
but I got a real early meeting
tomorrow, so.

01:07:11.727 --> 01:07:13.294
I waited for you.

01:07:15.464 --> 01:07:16.798
Lizzie.

01:07:18.067 --> 01:07:20.468
I just don't understand

01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:22.270
why you married me

01:07:22.272 --> 01:07:24.439
when you knew
I wanted children someday.

01:07:31.213 --> 01:07:33.681
I thought someday
I'd want them, too.

01:07:36.652 --> 01:07:38.286
I got to go.

01:07:40.689 --> 01:07:42.123

CASEY: Did you just drool
on yourself?

01:08:16.792 --> 01:08:18.126
PETER: No, no,
I spat on the floor.

01:08:18.127 --> 01:08:19.794
Oh, that's nice.
I'm good.

01:08:19.796 --> 01:08:22.764
PETER: All right, man,
sorry to bother you.

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:25.800
I didn't mean
to waste your time,
but I'm gonna drive. I'm good.

01:08:25.801 --> 01:08:27.535
Peter, give me
your fucking keys.

01:08:27.537 --> 01:08:29.671
No, I'm. Don't worry
about it. I'm gonna drive.
Peter...

01:08:29.673 --> 01:08:31.872
Let me see your keys.
You want to see them?

01:08:32.308 --> 01:08:34.709

Oh, yeah.
Yeah, early.

01:08:42.486 --> 01:08:44.519
Really early.
I'm gonna be up and at 'em.
I'm not joking man.

I know you're not,
you're not gonna get up.
You're serious.

You're not gonna get up.

01:08:48.357 --> 01:08:49.724

this piece of shit?

Just, look at her tags.

It says Joyce.
Honey.

01:11:07.931 --> 01:11:10.798
That's a lucky guess.
It says Joyce,
but how do you spell it?

Come on, I want to see
where this is going.

Why did you leave
your gate open?
Yeah?

01:11:26.749 --> 01:11:29.584
Yeah, we're
gonna call
the animal people.

01:11:31.353 --> 01:11:33.488
The people
that are in charge
of animals.

01:11:33.490 --> 01:11:34.789
They're half animal,
half people.

01:11:35.858 --> 01:11:37.592
It would be terrible
if they were in charge.

01:11:37.594 --> 01:11:39.327
If half animal, half people
were in charge of animals.

01:11:39.329 --> 01:11:40.662
Well, I mean
if they had people brains.

not ready to throw
in the towel here.

Come on, kid,
get off the ropes.

Give him hell.
Atta boy.
Give me your uppercut.

Use your reach.
Will you please
shut the hell up?

01:11:56.746 --> 01:11:59.314
But what if they were, like,
they're in charge
of all the animals

01:11:59.316 --> 01:12:01.516
and they were half animal,
half people.
That way they could...

01:12:01.518 --> 01:12:03.384
They can decide between,

01:12:03.386 --> 01:12:04.886
if there was a dispute
between animals and people.

01:12:04.888 --> 01:12:06.754
They're like.
"Well. I'm half of each,
so I'll decide".

I don't even know
what you're talking about.

a smart idea.

01:18:53.428 --> 01:18:54.895
DR. GRAYSON:
Oh, what happened?

01:18:54.897 --> 01:18:56.964
LIZZIE:
Well, we laughed a lot.

01:18:57.933 --> 01:18:59.967
I can't remember the last time
we laughed that much.

01:19:02.738 --> 01:19:05.406
And he told me
how proud he was of Casey,

01:19:09.177 --> 01:19:10.511
<i>and of me.</i>

01:19:37.839 --> 01:19:39.507
I guess I just couldn't see

01:19:39.509 --> 01:19:42.510
what was happening before,
or maybe
I just didn't want to see it.

01:19:43.211 --> 01:19:44.411
I saw it.

01:19:44.946 --> 01:19:46.147
Oh?

01:19:47.082 --> 01:19:50.117
So, why didn't you
say anything?

01:19:51.453 --> 01:19:53.053
It wasn't my place.

01:19:54.222 --> 01:19:55.890
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:20:14.442 --> 01:20:16.510
Did that hurt?
This?

01:20:16.512 --> 01:20:18.045
Yeah.
Ah.

01:20:18.047 --> 01:20:21.315
Over time.
So it's really not that bad.
Do it gradual.

01:20:21.850 --> 01:20:24.251
Just relax.
You'll be fine.
(SIGHS)

01:20:24.253 --> 01:20:26.353
Okay.
Want a shot
of tequila?

01:20:31.126 --> 01:20:32.293
Do it.

01:20:34.296 --> 01:20:37.264
LIZZIE: Fuck! Oh, fuck!

01:20:40.268 --> 01:20:42.102
What do you think
of that, Joyce?

01:20:42.104 --> 01:20:43.337
She likes it.

01:20:52.881 --> 01:20:55.349
Uh, I'm gonna go,
but I'll see you next week.

01:20:55.917 --> 01:20:57.484
Okay. See you, Justin.

01:21:22.177 --> 01:21:23.244
Hi.

01:21:24.346 --> 01:21:25.613
Come on, Joyce.

01:21:26.047 --> 01:21:28.148
Hello, Joyce.
Say hi.

01:21:28.150 --> 01:21:29.984
How are you doing?
(SIGHS)

01:21:29.986 --> 01:21:31.352
(BABY COOING)

01:21:34.422 --> 01:21:35.656
Wow.

01:21:38.159 --> 01:21:41.295
I don't think we ever got
a formal introduction.
Right.

01:21:42.931 --> 01:21:43.998
This is Gus.

01:21:47.135 --> 01:21:48.435
So big.

01:21:48.670 --> 01:21:50.104
I know.

01:21:50.572 --> 01:21:52.606
He's like
a giant mutant.

01:21:55.477 --> 01:21:56.944
So, how's it going?

01:21:58.079 --> 01:22:00.314
Pretty fucking hard,
actually.

01:22:01.216 --> 01:22:02.483
Yeah?

01:22:02.485 --> 01:22:04.385
Yeah, I had to
move back in
with my dad.

01:22:05.453 --> 01:22:07.121
Hmm.
It's,

01:22:07.355 --> 01:22:08.656
It's been all right.

01:22:09.224 --> 01:22:10.624
He, um,

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:13.928
he really loves
being a grandpa.

01:22:15.230 --> 01:22:16.597
Well, that's great.

01:22:22.037 --> 01:22:23.304
So, how about you?

01:22:24.706 --> 01:22:26.073
Me?

01:22:26.408 --> 01:22:27.675
Um,

01:22:30.345 --> 01:22:32.446
I'm considering
my options.

01:22:37.652 --> 01:22:39.720
It's going to be
one lucky kid.

01:22:40.555 --> 01:22:42.156
(BABY COOING)

01:22:42.958 --> 01:22:44.058
Hey.

01:22:44.060 --> 01:22:48.028
I really should
get him home
for his nap, so.

01:22:48.997 --> 01:22:50.230
Well, we're
going that way.

01:22:55.437 --> 01:22:56.603
Come on, Joyce.

01:22:57.205 --> 01:22:58.272
Come on.

01:22:58.606 --> 01:22:59.707
Let's go visit.

01:23:02.143 --> 01:23:03.610
Are you
okay there?
Yeah.

01:23:03.612 --> 01:23:05.012
Okay.

01:23:05.146 --> 01:23:06.213
Good dog.

01:23:07.182 --> 01:23:08.482
So, um.

01:23:09.284 --> 01:23:10.985
ANDIE: Is Justin
legal yet?

01:23:10.987 --> 01:23:12.252
(LIZZIE LAUGHS)

01:23:13.488 --> 01:23:15.723
He's got another
couple of weeks.
ANDIE: Yeah?

01:23:16.157 --> 01:23:17.658
Send him
my way.
I will.

01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:19.626
His French
is very, very good.

01:23:20.528 --> 01:23:22.363
Getting better
all the time.

01:23:22.365 --> 01:23:24.164
Action's a little
slow these days.

01:23:24.166 --> 01:23:26.200
I'm happy to go
a little bit younger.

01:23:26.202 --> 01:23:28.335
Well, you gotta do
what you gotta do.

01:23:29.104 --> 01:23:31.205
You know,
I think my dad's
new girlfriend

01:23:31.207 --> 01:23:32.773
is actually younger
than Justin.

01:23:33.308 --> 01:23:34.475
Oh, my God.

01:23:35.444 --> 01:23:38.779
Do you know
that they actually have
a kid on the way?

01:23:38.781 --> 01:23:40.280
(GASPING) No way.

01:23:40.282 --> 01:23:46.120
No, really. It's weird,
because I don't know if she's
sure how babies get made.
