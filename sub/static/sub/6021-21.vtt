00:30.630 --> 00:32.290
To see this movie
we gotta get moving.

00:32.465 --> 00:33.659
Let's roll.

00:33.833 --> 00:35.391
Come on, people. Previews.

00:41.307 --> 00:44.140
Oh, hello.

00:44.310 --> 00:45.641
Nine years.

00:45.812 --> 00:48.804
Seems like a long time,
doesn't it? It is.

00:48.982 --> 00:51.576
And we've packed a lot in,
the four of us.

00:51.751 --> 00:54.345
It seems like every week
a whole new set of problems...

00:54.521 --> 00:56.352
...would just crop up out of nowhere.

00:56.523 --> 00:57.922
Except for summer...

00:58.091 --> 01:00.685
...where nothing seemed to happen
for months at a time.

01:00.860 --> 01:03.226
Anyway, the point is,
over the last nine years--

01:03.396 --> 01:05.260
-<i>We're gonna miss the movie!</i>
-I'm coming!

01:05.432 --> 01:09.061
-<i>Previews, Jerry!</i>
-Just go already!

01:09.569 --> 01:12.697
Over the last nine years,
we've had a lot of experiences.

01:12.872 --> 01:16.535
And I'll tell you, when you stop
and add them all up...

01:16.709 --> 01:20.201
...that's what you realize.
Watch this.

01:20.380 --> 01:22.678
-<i>Jerry!</i>
-Shut up!

03:24.237 --> 03:25.636
What is this?

03:25.805 --> 03:29.468
Do you ever get the feeling like you
had a haircut, but you didn't have one?

03:29.642 --> 03:31.906
I'm all itchy back here.

03:37.016 --> 03:38.984
-What?
-What are we doing?

03:39.152 --> 03:42.383
-What in God's name are we doing?
-What?

03:42.555 --> 03:44.546
What-- What kind of
lives are these?

03:44.724 --> 03:46.453
We're like children. We're not men.

03:46.626 --> 03:49.094
No, we're not. We're not men.

03:49.762 --> 03:51.457
We're pathetic, you know that?

03:51.631 --> 03:53.895
Like I don't know that I'm pathetic.

03:58.938 --> 04:00.337
Oh, my God.

04:00.506 --> 04:03.134
I'm sorry, I thought
this was the baby's room.

04:03.610 --> 04:05.669
I'm really sorry.

04:09.882 --> 04:11.850
I was in the pool!

04:12.018 --> 04:13.508
I was in the pool!

04:16.289 --> 04:17.846
Since when do you smoke?

04:19.459 --> 04:21.188
I've always smoked.

04:22.228 --> 04:23.422
I've never seen you smoke.

04:23.596 --> 04:26.622
Oh, yeah, well. Big smoker.

04:26.799 --> 04:29.529
I gave it up for a while,
but it was too tough.

04:29.702 --> 04:33.468
You know, I don't got the willpower.

04:33.640 --> 04:35.767
I don't like this one bit.

04:35.942 --> 04:38.342
Well, I can't stop now.

04:40.913 --> 04:43.609
I'm addicted.
They got a hold on me.

04:44.350 --> 04:46.181
Well, you are gonna have to quit.

04:46.352 --> 04:48.217
Oh, God.

04:49.789 --> 04:51.154
That's why I'm different.

04:51.324 --> 04:54.293
I can sense the slightest
human suffering.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.627
Are you sensing anything
right now?

05:19.352 --> 05:21.217
Mrs. Enright!

05:21.387 --> 05:22.718
Mrs. Enright!

05:22.889 --> 05:24.652
Do you have a woman?

05:25.358 --> 05:27.326
-No.
-Do you have any prospects?

05:28.561 --> 05:30.392
No.

05:30.563 --> 05:32.929
You got anything on the horizon?

05:36.169 --> 05:37.864
No.

05:38.037 --> 05:41.495
Do you have any conceivable reason
for even getting up in the morning?

05:42.608 --> 05:45.236
I like to get the <i>Daily News.</i>

05:46.612 --> 05:48.944
How come
I didn't get a Christmas card?

05:49.115 --> 05:50.878
Everybody else got one.

05:51.050 --> 05:54.349
Jerry got one. Kramer got one.
I thought we were good friends.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.954
I don't get a Christmas card.
I don't get it.

05:57.123 --> 05:59.182
Want a Christmas card?
Want a Christmas card?

05:59.359 --> 06:02.123
All right, here.
Here's your Christmas card.

06:07.900 --> 06:11.199
Every group has someone
that they all make fun of.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.702
Like us, with Elaine.

06:22.749 --> 06:24.580
You're bald!

06:25.985 --> 06:27.646
No, I'm not.

06:27.820 --> 06:31.051
I was bald.

06:32.692 --> 06:34.182
Elaine.

06:34.794 --> 06:37.524
-Hey, hey, hey. Come on.
-No!

06:39.132 --> 06:40.759
No! No! No, Elaine!

06:40.933 --> 06:43.458
I don't like this thing!

06:43.636 --> 06:45.831
And here's what I'm doing with it!

06:46.005 --> 06:47.666
Stop!

06:49.509 --> 06:51.534
Stella.

06:54.514 --> 06:56.744
Stella!

06:58.284 --> 07:00.775
-Elaine, you don't like the movie?
-I hate it!

07:01.621 --> 07:03.179
Oh, go to hell!

07:03.356 --> 07:04.823
-Are you a liar?
-Are you?

07:04.991 --> 07:07.619
-Get your finger out of my face.
-I was here first.

07:07.794 --> 07:09.557
-I don't care.
-Get it out.

07:09.729 --> 07:11.128
Get it out.

07:11.297 --> 07:14.095
Hey, hey, hey. All right.
Hey, hey. Come on. Stop it.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.531
Come on. Break it up.

07:17.136 --> 07:18.763
Hey, hey!

07:18.938 --> 07:21.031
What's the matter with you?

07:22.141 --> 07:26.771
Now, don't you two see
that you're in love with each other?

07:29.148 --> 07:31.412
Kramer goes to a fantasy camp.

07:31.584 --> 07:34.144
His whole life is a fantasy camp.

07:34.320 --> 07:38.188
People should plunk down $2000
to live like him for a week.

07:38.357 --> 07:39.346
Do nothing.

07:39.525 --> 07:42.460
Fall ass-backwards into money.
Mooch food off your neighbors...

07:42.628 --> 07:45.791
...and have sex without dating.
That's a fantasy camp.

07:49.635 --> 07:51.830
Well, looks like
you've adjusted to the boxers.

07:52.004 --> 07:53.835
Well, I wouldn't go as far as that.

07:54.006 --> 07:56.975
-You went back to the Jockeys?
-Wrong again.

07:58.544 --> 08:00.569
Oh, no.

08:02.648 --> 08:04.548
What? What?

08:04.717 --> 08:07.481
Don't you see
what's going on here?

08:08.054 --> 08:10.079
No boxers, no Jockeys.

08:13.826 --> 08:16.989
The only thing between him and us
is a thin layer of gabardine.

08:17.163 --> 08:21.099
I'm out there, Jerry,
and I'm loving every minute of it.

08:28.241 --> 08:30.175
A facecloth for your--

08:39.751 --> 08:40.741
Hey!

08:41.254 --> 08:45.782
Ladies and gentlemen, it's our
good friend, George Costanza.

08:45.958 --> 08:48.153
What a surprise.

08:51.130 --> 08:53.223
Kramer, he's just a dentist.

08:53.399 --> 08:56.197
Yeah, and you're an anti-dentite.

08:58.804 --> 09:00.465
I am not an anti-dentite.

09:00.640 --> 09:03.905
You're a rabid anti-dentite.

09:04.076 --> 09:06.874
Next thing, you're saying
they should have their own schools.

09:07.046 --> 09:09.776
-They do have their own schools.
-Yeah!

09:09.949 --> 09:12.747
What kind of a person are you?

09:13.286 --> 09:15.186
I think I'm pretty much like you.

09:15.354 --> 09:17.322
Only successful.

09:24.096 --> 09:26.291
No! No!

09:26.465 --> 09:29.025
Anyway, I wanted to talk to you
about Dr. Whatley.

09:29.201 --> 09:31.897
I have a suspicion
that he's converted to Judaism...

09:32.071 --> 09:34.835
...purely for the jokes.

09:35.007 --> 09:37.498
And this offends you
as a Jewish person?

09:37.677 --> 09:40.339
No, it offends me as a comedian.

09:42.615 --> 09:44.606
<i>Would you be interested in
switching over...</i>

09:44.784 --> 09:48.242
-<i>...to TMI long distance service?</i>
-Oh, gee, I can't talk right now.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.981
Give me your home number
and I'll call you later.

09:51.157 --> 09:53.250
<i>Well, I'm sorry,
we're not allowed to do that.</i>

09:53.426 --> 09:55.724
I guess you don't want
people calling you at home.

09:55.895 --> 09:58.728
-<i>No.</i>
-Well, now you know how I feel.

10:03.202 --> 10:04.863
Hey, buddy.

10:06.005 --> 10:09.668
I'm on no sleep. No sleep!
You don't know what it's like in there.

10:09.842 --> 10:12.174
All night long, things are creaking
and cracking.

10:12.345 --> 10:15.337
And that red light
is burning my brain.

10:15.514 --> 10:18.540
-You look a little stressed.
-Oh, I'm stressed.

10:22.054 --> 10:24.488
Jerry. Kill me.

10:26.292 --> 10:27.987
Kill me now. I'm begging you.

10:32.365 --> 10:34.833
Well, what, kind of like this?

10:35.001 --> 10:36.832
What-- What are you doing?

10:37.570 --> 10:38.730
Jerry!

10:39.472 --> 10:40.905
Jerry!

10:42.174 --> 10:44.074
Jerry.

10:46.145 --> 10:49.376
Elaine. What are you doing here?

11:00.860 --> 11:02.987
Oh, my God.

11:47.773 --> 11:50.401
What percentage of people
would you say are good-looking?

11:50.576 --> 11:53.204
-25 percent.
-25 percent?

11:53.379 --> 11:56.041
No way. It's, like, four to six percent.

11:56.215 --> 11:57.477
It's a 20-to-1 shot.

11:57.650 --> 11:59.345
-You're way off.
-Way off?

11:59.518 --> 12:03.215
Have you been to the motor vehicle
bureau? It's a leper colony there.

12:03.956 --> 12:05.981
So basically what you're saying is...

12:06.158 --> 12:08.558
...95 percent of the population
is undatable?

12:08.728 --> 12:10.355
Undatable!

12:10.529 --> 12:12.656
Then how are all these people
getting together?

12:12.832 --> 12:14.299
Alcohol.

12:17.636 --> 12:19.900
What about you?
Did people make fun of your name?

12:20.072 --> 12:21.903
Are you kidding?
What do you expect...

12:22.074 --> 12:24.975
...when your name rhymes
with a part of the female anatomy?

12:30.149 --> 12:31.514
Oh, Jerry.

12:31.684 --> 12:34.414
Oh, you.

12:34.587 --> 12:37.317
Love is a spice with many tastes.

12:37.490 --> 12:41.187
A dizzying array
of textures and moments.

12:42.061 --> 12:44.495
All right, let's go.
I'll give you half an hour.

12:47.933 --> 12:49.992
-What?
-Come on.

12:50.169 --> 12:52.000
-Are you serious?
-Look, Jerry.

12:52.171 --> 12:54.935
We have to have sex
to save the friendship.

12:56.375 --> 12:59.606
Sex to save the friendship.

13:02.548 --> 13:06.541
Well, if we have to, we have to.

13:14.660 --> 13:15.854
What's going on?

13:16.028 --> 13:17.928
It was a pleasure
doing business with you.

13:18.097 --> 13:20.088
But I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to get going.

13:20.266 --> 13:23.030
"Get going"?
But we haven't really, you know....

13:23.202 --> 13:25.067
Eight dollars? Eight dollars?

13:25.237 --> 13:27.068
What are you doing?
You're robbing me?

13:27.239 --> 13:30.572
I wasted my whole morning
on you for $8?

13:30.743 --> 13:33.541
-Wait a second, what are you doing?
-I'm taking your clothes.

13:33.712 --> 13:35.179
No, no, no! That's my only suit!

13:35.347 --> 13:38.248
It cost me $350.
I got it at Moe Ginsburg!

13:38.417 --> 13:41.716
-Bye, George.
-Wait, you can't just leave me here.

13:41.887 --> 13:44.378
Will I see you again?

13:44.557 --> 13:46.684
You just tell him
that you're my boyfriend...

13:46.859 --> 13:49.123
...and that we're in love, okay?
Can you do that?

13:49.295 --> 13:52.093
-Yeah, yeah. I'm your boyfriend. Yeah.
-Okay.

13:52.264 --> 13:54.027
Have we been intimate?

13:56.302 --> 13:58.429
Yeah. Yeah, we've been intimate.

13:58.604 --> 14:00.367
All right, how often do we do it?

14:02.141 --> 14:03.608
Kramer, how is that important?

14:03.776 --> 14:05.607
Do you really think
he's gonna ask that?

14:05.778 --> 14:09.578
Elaine, he's a psychiatrist.
They're interested in stuff like that.

14:10.149 --> 14:14.745
All right, all right.
We do it five times a week.

14:14.920 --> 14:16.785
-Okay?
-Oh, baby.

14:16.956 --> 14:18.446
Oh, man.

14:19.491 --> 14:21.755
So we're fooling around there,
you know.

14:21.927 --> 14:26.762
It's getting a little passionate
and she starts with the dirty talking.

14:26.932 --> 14:31.835
All right. All right.
Hold on. Time out.

14:33.505 --> 14:35.473
-What did she say?
-Typical things.

14:35.641 --> 14:38.838
What's typical? Give me typical.
Give me some typical.

14:39.678 --> 14:41.373
She says....

14:49.755 --> 14:51.086
George.

14:51.257 --> 14:52.417
What are you doing?

14:56.061 --> 14:57.961
You know.

14:58.130 --> 14:59.256
Pleasuring you.

14:59.431 --> 15:03.094
It feels like aliens
poking at my body.

15:04.069 --> 15:07.129
-So you think you're spongeworthy?
-Yes, I think I'm spongeworthy.

15:07.306 --> 15:09.604
I think I'm very spongeworthy.

15:10.175 --> 15:13.167
Run down your case for me again.

15:13.345 --> 15:14.972
Well, we've gone out several times.

15:15.147 --> 15:17.581
We obviously have a good rapport.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.274
I eat well. I exercise.

15:19.451 --> 15:21.851
Blood tests, immaculate.

15:22.988 --> 15:27.288
-Do something about your sideburns?
-Yeah, I told you. I'm gonna.

15:28.360 --> 15:30.385
-All right, let's go.
-Okay.

15:31.830 --> 15:34.094
I might tell her that I love her.

15:34.266 --> 15:37.258
Well, that's a big move,
Georgie boy.

15:37.436 --> 15:40.405
Are you confident
in the "I love you" return?

15:40.906 --> 15:42.806
Fifty-fifty.

15:42.975 --> 15:45.603
Because if you don't
get that return...

15:45.778 --> 15:48.975
...that's a pretty big matzo ball
hanging out there.

15:51.450 --> 15:53.543
Well, I just gotta say it once.

15:53.719 --> 15:56.745
Everybody else gets to say it.
Why can't I say it?

15:56.922 --> 15:58.446
What, you've never said it?

15:58.624 --> 16:00.751
Once, to a dog.

16:02.261 --> 16:04.786
He licked himself and left the room.

16:05.798 --> 16:08.323
How is it that a man like you...

16:08.500 --> 16:12.732
...so bald and so quirky and funny...

16:12.905 --> 16:14.497
...how is it you're not taken?

16:16.976 --> 16:18.773
Well, Marisa...

16:18.944 --> 16:21.276
...see, the thing is...

16:23.282 --> 16:25.546
...I'm sort of engaged.

16:43.736 --> 16:46.671
I'm not married. I'm not allowed
to go out with somebody else?

16:46.839 --> 16:48.739
-Depends.
-Depends on what?

16:48.907 --> 16:51.034
-On many factors.
-Like what?

16:51.210 --> 16:54.304
Well, how long
you've been seeing her.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.038
What's your phone call frequency?

16:56.215 --> 16:58.115
-Are you on a daily?
-No.

16:58.283 --> 17:00.183
Semi-daily.
Four or five times a week.

17:00.352 --> 17:03.082
Do you have to ask her out
or is the date implied?

17:03.756 --> 17:04.744
Implied.

17:05.324 --> 17:07.723
She got anything
in your medicine cabinet?

17:07.893 --> 17:10.156
Might be some moisturizer.

17:11.896 --> 17:13.797
Let me ask you this.

17:13.965 --> 17:16.730
Is there any Tampax in your house?

17:21.906 --> 17:23.568
Yeah.

17:24.443 --> 17:26.273
Well, I'll tell you what you got here.

17:26.444 --> 17:29.846
-You got yourself a girlfriend.
-Oh, no, no, no.

17:32.151 --> 17:35.882
I mean, what are you thinking about,
Jerry? Marriage? Family?

17:36.321 --> 17:38.983
-Well....
-They're prisons.

17:39.158 --> 17:42.127
Man-made prisons.
You're doing time.

17:42.294 --> 17:44.592
You get up in the morning,
she's there.

17:44.763 --> 17:46.526
You go to sleep at night,
she's there.

17:46.698 --> 17:50.225
It's like you gotta ask permission to--
To use the bathroom.

17:50.402 --> 17:54.065
"Is it all right
if I use the bathroom now?"

17:54.239 --> 17:55.228
-Really?
-Yeah.

17:55.407 --> 17:58.103
And you can forget about
watching TV while you're eating.

17:58.277 --> 18:00.268
Because it's dinnertime.

18:00.446 --> 18:02.437
-And you know what you do at dinner?
-What?

18:02.614 --> 18:04.844
You talk about your day.

18:05.017 --> 18:06.177
"How was your day today?"

18:06.351 --> 18:08.182
"Did you have a good day
or a bad day?"

18:08.353 --> 18:12.414
"Well, what kind of day was it?"
"Well, I don't know, how about you?"

18:12.591 --> 18:16.493
-I'm glad we had this talk.
-You have no idea.

18:16.662 --> 18:18.527
Do I have to break up with her
in person?

18:18.697 --> 18:21.791
Can't I do it over the phone?
I have no stomach for these things.

18:21.967 --> 18:25.596
You should just do it like a Band-Aid.
One motion, right off.

18:26.839 --> 18:28.466
What's the matter?

18:28.640 --> 18:29.834
Nothing.

18:30.008 --> 18:32.067
You're acting weird.
Is anything wrong?

18:32.244 --> 18:33.370
No.

18:33.545 --> 18:35.706
Are you breaking up with me?

18:36.915 --> 18:38.746
Are we going out?

18:39.251 --> 18:41.446
You're breaking up with me,
aren't you?

18:41.820 --> 18:44.812
-Do you want me to break up?
-If that's what you want.

18:45.023 --> 18:46.684
I don't know
what you're talking about.

18:46.859 --> 18:50.454
-Okay, fine. Break up with me.
-All right. We're broken up.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.196
Can we still be friends?

18:56.802 --> 18:59.270
Listen to this.
Marcy comes over and she tells me...

18:59.438 --> 19:01.838
...that her ex-boyfriend
was over late last night...

19:02.007 --> 19:05.067
...and, "yada, yada, yada,
I'm really tired today."

19:06.545 --> 19:08.206
What do you think
she was tired from?

19:08.380 --> 19:11.144
Well, obviously the yada, yada.

19:12.217 --> 19:15.118
You don't think
she'd yada, yada sex?

19:15.287 --> 19:17.551
I've yada, yada'd sex.

19:17.723 --> 19:19.088
-Really?
-Yeah.

19:19.258 --> 19:21.123
I met this lawyer,
we went out to dinner.

19:21.293 --> 19:23.625
I had the lobster bisque.
We went back to my place.

19:23.795 --> 19:26.730
Yada, yada, yada,
I never heard from him again.

19:28.534 --> 19:30.593
But you yada, yada'd
over the best part.

19:30.769 --> 19:33.169
No, I mentioned the bisque.

19:35.908 --> 19:38.274
Allison spoke to me...

19:38.443 --> 19:40.638
...and she wanted me
to speak to you.

19:42.047 --> 19:44.948
So Allison and I think that
the best thing to do is just...

19:45.117 --> 19:46.709
...make a clean break.

19:46.885 --> 19:48.580
Can't we discuss this?

19:48.754 --> 19:52.451
We just don't think you're ready
for a serious relationship.

19:53.091 --> 19:55.286
I didn't even know
you wanted to get serious.

19:55.460 --> 19:57.621
So, what am I in this for?

19:58.597 --> 20:00.690
You know, I'm getting to a point
in my life...

20:00.866 --> 20:03.562
...where I need something more
than just...

20:03.735 --> 20:05.600
...a good time.

20:06.738 --> 20:09.263
Kramer, please.

20:09.875 --> 20:13.470
You didn't have make-up sex?
How could you not have make-up sex?

20:13.645 --> 20:16.637
That's the best feature
of the heavy relationship.

20:16.815 --> 20:19.181
I missed out on the make-up sex.

20:21.153 --> 20:24.452
The only sex you're gonna have
better than make-up sex...

20:24.623 --> 20:27.854
...is if you're sent to prison
and you have a conjugal visit.

20:28.961 --> 20:32.124
Yeah, conjugal visit sex.
That is happening.

20:32.297 --> 20:34.925
David, I'm going to hell.

20:35.100 --> 20:37.068
The worst place in the world.

20:37.236 --> 20:42.105
With devils and those caves,
and the ragged clothing.

20:42.274 --> 20:45.505
And the heat. My God, the heat.

20:45.677 --> 20:47.838
I mean, what do you think
about all that?

20:48.013 --> 20:49.844
It's gonna be rough.

20:50.015 --> 20:51.607
You should be trying to save me.

20:51.783 --> 20:54.115
Don't boss me.
This is why you're going to hell.

20:54.286 --> 20:55.514
I am not going to hell.

20:55.687 --> 20:59.145
And if you think I'm going to hell,
you should care that I'm going to hell.

20:59.324 --> 21:01.849
Even though I am not.

21:02.461 --> 21:04.190
You stole my Jesus fish, didn't you?

21:04.363 --> 21:06.854
Yeah, that's right.

21:07.432 --> 21:10.367
If she is allowed
to infiltrate this world...

21:10.535 --> 21:14.972
...then George Costanza
as you know him ceases to exist.

21:15.140 --> 21:18.541
You see, right now,
I have relationship George.

21:18.710 --> 21:22.441
But there is also
independent George.

21:22.614 --> 21:25.515
That's the George you know.
The George you grew up with.

21:25.684 --> 21:30.314
Movie George. Coffee shop George.
Liar George. Bawdy George.

21:30.489 --> 21:32.821
-I love that George.
-Me too.

21:32.991 --> 21:35.585
And he's dying, Jerry.

21:35.761 --> 21:38.628
If relationship George
walks through this door...

21:38.797 --> 21:42.233
...he will kill independent George.

21:42.401 --> 21:46.633
A George divided against itself
cannot stand!

21:46.805 --> 21:49.137
Would you like some bread, Jerry?

21:50.008 --> 21:52.636
No. No thanks, I'm just not hungry.

21:52.811 --> 21:54.904
Then at least drink your beer.

21:58.383 --> 21:59.372
Twist-off.

21:59.551 --> 22:02.418
You have a little something
on your face.

22:03.855 --> 22:05.482
She had man hands.

22:05.657 --> 22:07.557
-He's a re-gifter.
-She's a two-face.

22:07.726 --> 22:09.023
She's got the jimmy legs.

22:09.194 --> 22:11.389
-She's a virgin.
-He's poor.

22:11.563 --> 22:14.760
She's got everything I've always
wanted in another human being.

22:14.933 --> 22:15.991
Except for the walking.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.932
She eats her peas one at a time.

22:19.104 --> 22:20.731
She just took credit for my salad.

22:20.906 --> 22:23.602
He's a male bimbo. He's a mimbo.

22:23.775 --> 22:26.209
-She's one of these low talkers.
-He's a high talker.

22:26.378 --> 22:29.074
-Bit of a close talker.
-She can't hear very well.

22:29.247 --> 22:31.841
-She's bald?
-She's bald!

22:32.017 --> 22:33.678
He's a bad breaker-upper.

22:33.852 --> 22:35.410
She went out with Newman.

22:35.587 --> 22:37.054
He's like a Svengali.

22:37.222 --> 22:38.689
-She's too tan.
-She's too good.

22:38.857 --> 22:40.222
She wasn't my type.

22:40.392 --> 22:43.225
She just dislikes me so much.

22:44.062 --> 22:45.859
It's irresistible.

22:51.203 --> 22:52.363
How could I do this?

22:52.537 --> 22:55.028
How can I move back in
with those people? Tell me.

22:55.207 --> 22:56.834
They're insane. You know that.

22:57.008 --> 22:59.033
Hey, my parents
are just as crazy as yours.

22:59.211 --> 23:00.769
-I'm paying.
-Dad, I'm paying.

23:00.946 --> 23:02.607
-Get out of here.
-You're not paying.

23:02.781 --> 23:05.147
Now, Jerry, please
do not do this to your father.

23:05.317 --> 23:07.285
I can't get it open.

23:09.020 --> 23:12.285
Yay, Jerry got it open.

23:13.492 --> 23:16.052
How can you compare your parents
to my parents?

23:16.228 --> 23:18.788
I told everybody about it.
Everybody knows.

23:18.964 --> 23:20.022
I stopped short.

23:20.699 --> 23:22.860
<i>It's Frank Costanza,
Mr. Steinbrenner's here...</i>

23:23.034 --> 23:24.695
<i>...George is dead, call me back.</i>

23:24.870 --> 23:26.497
Georgie, I'm a divorcée.

23:26.671 --> 23:28.730
You're not a divorcée.
You're just separated.

23:28.907 --> 23:30.602
You're a "separatée."

23:30.776 --> 23:33.176
-Well, I'm out there, George.
-You're not out there.

23:33.345 --> 23:35.336
-I am too.
-You're not out there.

23:35.514 --> 23:38.574
You can't be, because I am out there.
And if I see you out there...

23:38.750 --> 23:40.843
...there's not enough voltage
in this world...

23:41.019 --> 23:43.920
...to electroshock me
back into coherence.

23:45.757 --> 23:47.952
This is delicious, Mrs. Ross.

23:48.360 --> 23:50.294
Let me understand.

23:50.462 --> 23:53.454
You got the hen, the chicken
and the rooster.

23:53.632 --> 23:55.964
The rooster goes with the chicken.

23:56.134 --> 23:58.102
So who's having sex with the hen?

23:59.004 --> 24:01.802
-We'll talk about it another time.
-But you see my point?

24:01.973 --> 24:05.340
You only hear of a hen,
a rooster and a chicken.

24:05.510 --> 24:08.809
-Something's missing.
-Something's missing, all right.

24:08.980 --> 24:11.540
They're all chickens.

24:11.716 --> 24:13.877
The rooster has sex with all of them.

24:15.654 --> 24:17.485
That's perverse.

25:06.204 --> 25:09.173
Hello, and welcome
to Movie Phone.

25:09.341 --> 25:13.607
If you know the name of the movie
you'd like to see, press one.

25:13.778 --> 25:14.972
Come on, come on.

25:15.146 --> 25:17.239
Using your touch-tone keypad...

25:17.415 --> 25:20.851
...please enter the first three letters
of the movie title now.

25:23.121 --> 25:27.387
You've selected <i>Agent Zero</i>.

25:27.559 --> 25:30.050
If that's correct, press one.

25:31.463 --> 25:32.896
What?

25:33.064 --> 25:36.090
You've selected <i>Brown-Eyed Girl</i>.

25:36.268 --> 25:38.498
If this is correct, press one.

25:42.674 --> 25:46.132
Why don't you just tell me
the name of the movie you selected?

25:46.311 --> 25:48.404
That couple is breaking up.

25:50.048 --> 25:51.777
They're breaking up?

25:51.950 --> 25:54.214
-How do you know?
-She reads lips.

25:56.555 --> 25:58.147
Oh, my God.

25:58.323 --> 26:00.814
I-- I just had a great idea.

26:01.326 --> 26:04.887
She could come to the party tomorrow
and read Gwen's lips for me.

26:06.698 --> 26:08.222
What?

26:09.434 --> 26:11.402
We bring her to the party...

26:11.570 --> 26:14.937
...and she tells me
what Gwen is saying about me.

26:16.775 --> 26:18.606
She's not a novelty act, George...

26:18.777 --> 26:22.440
...that you hire out
for weddings and bar mitzvahs.

26:22.614 --> 26:26.380
Look, it's a skill, just like juggling.

26:26.551 --> 26:29.418
She'll probably enjoy showing it off.

26:31.089 --> 26:33.319
I don't know, George.

26:33.491 --> 26:36.187
I'm not sure about this.

26:36.361 --> 26:39.353
Would you ask her? Just ask her.

26:40.432 --> 26:43.492
-If she says no, case closed.
-All right.

26:46.104 --> 26:48.698
Laura, George was wondering--

26:48.873 --> 26:50.807
Sure. I'll do it.

26:52.644 --> 26:54.202
Hey, there.

26:59.951 --> 27:02.818
One mulligatawny, and....

27:03.989 --> 27:06.719
-What is that? Is that lima bean?
-Yes.

27:06.891 --> 27:09.121
Never been a big fan.

27:12.263 --> 27:14.231
You know what?
Has anyone ever told you....

27:14.399 --> 27:17.232
...you look exactly like Al Pacino?

27:17.402 --> 27:19.427
You know, <i>Scent of a Woman</i>.

27:22.474 --> 27:25.341
Very good. Very good.
You know something?

27:25.510 --> 27:27.478
-No soup for you!
-What?

27:27.646 --> 27:29.307
Come back, one year.

27:31.416 --> 27:34.078
Kramer, I've been
reviewing your work.

27:34.252 --> 27:36.516
Quite frankly, it stinks.

27:37.322 --> 27:39.085
Well, l....

27:39.257 --> 27:42.158
I've been having trouble
at home, and....

27:42.327 --> 27:44.352
I mean, you know, I'll work harder.

27:44.529 --> 27:46.292
Nights, weekends,
whatever it takes.

27:46.464 --> 27:50.059
No. No, I don't think
that's going to do it.

27:50.235 --> 27:53.671
These reports you handed in,
it's almost as if...

27:53.838 --> 27:55.931
...you have
no business training at all.

27:57.609 --> 28:00.043
I don't know
what this is supposed to be.

28:00.211 --> 28:04.170
Well, I'm just trying to get ahead.

28:05.016 --> 28:08.383
Well, I'm sorry. There's just no way
that we could keep you on.

28:08.553 --> 28:10.817
I don't even really work here.

28:13.425 --> 28:15.325
That's what makes this so difficult.

28:17.462 --> 28:19.521
I will never understand people.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.563
They're the worst.

28:24.569 --> 28:26.969
Why do they call it Ovaltine?

28:27.138 --> 28:28.571
The mug is round.

28:28.740 --> 28:30.298
The jar is round.

28:30.475 --> 28:32.773
They should call it "Roundtine."

28:34.679 --> 28:37.512
That's gold, Jerry. Gold.

28:44.489 --> 28:46.081
Stop.

28:51.763 --> 28:54.254
Well, you ladies look lovely tonight.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.695
Good night, honey.

28:58.236 --> 28:59.760
Good night.

29:01.039 --> 29:03.906
Come on, Uncle Leo, I've seen
the way women look at you.

29:04.075 --> 29:06.908
When's the last time you looked
in the mirror? You're an Adonis.

29:07.078 --> 29:09.512
You're the only one I know
who's got the good stuff.

29:09.681 --> 29:12.707
And I need it bad. I feel like
I've got bugs crawling up my skin.

29:12.884 --> 29:15.910
-Now, you gotta help me out.
-Not on my watch!

29:16.087 --> 29:19.022
I won't have you turning my office
into a den of iniquity.

29:19.190 --> 29:21.215
-Get your fix somewhere else!
-Hey! Hey!

29:21.392 --> 29:23.587
Go on, cretin!

29:26.598 --> 29:28.190
Look at you, you're disgusting.

29:28.366 --> 29:30.334
If a woman
can take your presence...

29:30.535 --> 29:34.631
...for more than 10 seconds, you
should hang onto her like grim death.

29:34.806 --> 29:37.070
Which is not far off, by the way.

29:37.242 --> 29:39.938
Tim, do you think you should be
making jokes like that?

29:40.111 --> 29:42.272
Why not? I'm Jewish, remember?

29:43.281 --> 29:45.340
-I know, but--
-Jerry.

29:45.517 --> 29:49.783
It's our sense of humor that sustained
us as a people for 3000 years.

29:50.922 --> 29:54.323
-Five thousand.
-Five thousand. Even better.

29:56.194 --> 29:57.684
Okay.

29:57.862 --> 30:02.162
Crissy, give me a shtickl of flouride.

30:02.333 --> 30:05.029
What do you think, I've never
ridden in a Cadillac before?

30:05.203 --> 30:08.138
Believe me, I have ridden
in a Cadillac hundreds of times.

30:08.306 --> 30:09.568
Thousands.

30:11.943 --> 30:14.309
You put the balm on?
Who told you to put the balm on?

30:14.479 --> 30:16.674
I didn't tell you to.
Why'd you put the balm on?

30:16.848 --> 30:18.475
Where did you get
that balm, anyway?

30:18.650 --> 30:20.208
-The Maestro.
-The who?

30:21.820 --> 30:23.219
Jerry.

30:23.688 --> 30:26.714
Tonight you in for a real treat.

30:26.891 --> 30:29.451
I'm personally
gonna prepare the dinner...

30:29.627 --> 30:32.152
...for you and my Audrey.

30:40.672 --> 30:43.800
Hey, Cedric, Bob.
This guy won't wear a ribbon.

30:45.243 --> 30:48.144
Who? Who doesn't want
to wear the ribbon?

30:53.651 --> 30:55.642
Hello, Jerry. May I come in?

30:55.820 --> 30:59.381
Perhaps there's more to Newman
than meets the eye.

30:59.824 --> 31:01.291
No, there's less.

31:03.628 --> 31:05.653
Hello, Mrs. Seinfeld.

31:06.264 --> 31:09.131
Hello, Newman.

31:09.801 --> 31:11.701
Excellent.

31:12.704 --> 31:14.569
Excellent.

31:14.739 --> 31:16.673
I've looked into his eyes.

31:16.841 --> 31:18.001
He's pure evil.

31:18.743 --> 31:20.608
All right. All right.

31:20.778 --> 31:23.770
All right, you go ahead.
You go ahead, you keep it secret.

31:23.948 --> 31:25.279
But you remember this.

31:25.450 --> 31:30.820
When you control the mail,
you control information.

31:41.499 --> 31:44.024
Oh, the humanity!

31:47.205 --> 31:50.003
<i>Believe it or not,
George isn't at home</i>

31:50.174 --> 31:53.234
<i>Please leave a message
At the beep</i>

31:54.212 --> 31:57.477
<i>I must be out,
Or I'd pick up the phone</i>

31:57.649 --> 32:00.675
<i>Where could I be?</i>

32:00.852 --> 32:04.879
<i>Believe it or not, I'm not home</i>

32:05.056 --> 32:06.045
It's funny, George.

32:06.224 --> 32:08.624
You don't know how you're
feeling about something...

32:08.793 --> 32:12.559
...until a person like you comes along
and articulates it so perfectly.

32:13.164 --> 32:14.563
Articulate?

32:23.441 --> 32:24.840
What?

32:25.209 --> 32:26.437
-Live.
-Live?

32:26.611 --> 32:27.669
-Live.
-Live?

32:27.845 --> 32:31.303
-Live.
-Oh, right, right, right, right, right.

32:39.891 --> 32:42.257
No. No. No. No. No.

32:42.427 --> 32:43.951
Oh, yeah!

32:47.298 --> 32:50.290
All right. All right. All right!

32:50.468 --> 32:51.662
-George, Marla.
-Marla.

32:51.836 --> 32:53.463
-George.
-Jerry, Stacy.

32:53.638 --> 32:55.162
-Jerry.
-George, Stacy.

32:55.340 --> 32:56.967
-Stacy.
-George.

32:57.141 --> 32:58.836
-George.
-Jerry.

32:59.010 --> 33:00.773
Marla. Stacy.

33:00.945 --> 33:02.071
-Newman.
-Jerry.

33:02.246 --> 33:03.645
-Elaine.
-George.

33:03.815 --> 33:05.180
-Newman.
-Jerry.

33:05.350 --> 33:06.442
-Kramer.
-Whatley.

33:06.617 --> 33:08.744
-Newman.
-Jambalaya.

33:08.920 --> 33:10.353
Are we finished?

33:10.521 --> 33:12.045
Done.

33:17.628 --> 33:21.189
-So you're still master of your domain?
-Yes. Yes, I am.

33:21.366 --> 33:24.631
But I will tell you this.
I am going over to her apartment...

33:24.802 --> 33:27.032
...and I'm telling her
to put those shades down.

33:27.205 --> 33:28.832
Wait, wait. What did you just say?

33:29.007 --> 33:31.874
I can't take it anymore.
She's driving me crazy.

33:32.043 --> 33:35.206
I can't sleep, I can't leave the house.
I'm climbing the walls.

33:35.380 --> 33:37.245
I'm dating a virgin,
I'm in this contest.

33:37.415 --> 33:39.178
Something's gotta give.

33:42.687 --> 33:44.154
He took it out.

33:49.694 --> 33:51.025
He what?

33:51.195 --> 33:53.220
He took...

33:54.265 --> 33:56.062
...it out.

33:56.734 --> 33:58.463
What are you doing to yourself?

33:58.636 --> 34:00.695
I can't stop.

34:01.672 --> 34:03.537
Alex thinks I'm naturally hairless.

34:03.708 --> 34:05.437
What? You can't keep this up.

34:05.610 --> 34:07.237
Don't you know
what's gonna happen?

34:07.412 --> 34:11.246
Every time you shave it, it's gonna
come in thicker and fuller and darker.

34:11.416 --> 34:13.077
Oh, that's an old wives' tale.

34:13.251 --> 34:15.811
Is it? Look at this.

34:16.687 --> 34:19.485
-What--? What is that?
-Jerry, look at it!

34:19.657 --> 34:21.454
Look at it!

34:25.496 --> 34:27.760
Could it be because you
don't want him to know...

34:27.931 --> 34:29.922
...you have a friend
who pees in the shower?

34:30.101 --> 34:32.034
-No, that's not it.
-Oh, I think it is.

34:32.203 --> 34:34.728
-That's exactly what it is!
-Why couldn't you wait?

34:34.906 --> 34:37.033
I was there! I saw a drain!

34:37.208 --> 34:38.937
Since when is a drain a toilet?

34:39.110 --> 34:41.168
It's all pipes! What's the difference?

34:41.344 --> 34:43.404
Different pipes
go to different places.

34:43.581 --> 34:45.139
I'll call a plumber right now!

34:45.315 --> 34:47.614
Could we just drop
all the pee-pipe stuff here?

34:47.784 --> 34:48.842
Okay!

35:09.107 --> 35:10.904
What is that?

35:13.044 --> 35:15.137
I think it's the horse.

35:15.313 --> 35:17.042
Oh, my God.

35:17.215 --> 35:20.116
Hey, how's everything?
You need anything?

35:20.284 --> 35:22.013
I can't-- I can't take this.

35:26.124 --> 35:28.388
We can't breathe back here.

35:28.559 --> 35:30.493
Rusty!

35:32.330 --> 35:34.298
Rusty!

35:34.465 --> 35:37.491
So we're gonna make the post office
pay for my new stereo now?

35:37.668 --> 35:39.158
It's a write-off for them.

35:39.337 --> 35:42.101
-How is it a write-off?
-They just write it off.

35:42.707 --> 35:44.140
Write it off what?

35:44.308 --> 35:47.334
Jerry, all these big companies,
they write off everything.

35:47.979 --> 35:50.675
You don't even know
what a write-off is.

35:52.250 --> 35:54.810
-Do you?
-No, I don't.

35:54.986 --> 35:56.385
But they do.

35:56.554 --> 35:59.489
And they're the ones writing it off.

36:02.493 --> 36:04.620
I like sports.
I could do something in sports.

36:10.801 --> 36:13.133
In what capacity?

36:14.772 --> 36:17.866
You know, like the general manager
of a baseball team.

36:21.846 --> 36:24.280
Yeah, well,
that can be tough to get.

36:25.383 --> 36:28.546
Well, it doesn't even have to be
the general manager.

36:28.719 --> 36:31.552
Maybe I could be, like, an announcer.
Like a color man.

36:31.722 --> 36:35.658
You know how I always make those
interesting comments during the game.

36:35.826 --> 36:38.056
Yeah.
Yeah, you make good comments.

36:38.229 --> 36:39.787
So, what about that?

36:39.964 --> 36:43.559
Well, you know, they tend to
give those jobs to ex-ballplayers...

36:43.734 --> 36:48.228
...and people that are,
you know, in broadcasting.

36:52.610 --> 36:55.670
-Well, that's really not fair.
-I know.

36:55.846 --> 36:58.440
And I'll tell you another thing,
Cosmo Kramer.

36:58.616 --> 37:00.982
The kissing thing is over.
There's no more kissing.

37:01.152 --> 37:03.780
And I don't care
what the consequences are.

37:24.909 --> 37:28.310
Kramer, what the hell is going--?

37:28.479 --> 37:30.777
Jerry, come on, man.

37:36.053 --> 37:37.884
-Are you in?
-What, are you kidding?

37:38.055 --> 37:40.649
You see those ladies
I got showing?

37:40.825 --> 37:43.919
You think they're scared?

37:47.198 --> 37:48.790
Oh, man, you're killing me.

37:56.474 --> 37:57.532
Oh, forget it.

37:57.708 --> 37:59.505
Julia's still laughing.

37:59.677 --> 38:01.042
Okay.

38:04.815 --> 38:07.875
There's no point in going.
Julia's laughing.

38:08.052 --> 38:09.815
-No I'm not.
-Okay, can we go?

38:09.987 --> 38:13.479
-No. She's laughing. Right now.
-Yes. Yes. We can go.

38:13.658 --> 38:15.853
Go ahead, waste the film.
Waste everyone's time.

38:16.027 --> 38:18.757
Okay, here we go. All right.

38:18.929 --> 38:21.659
And action.

38:24.635 --> 38:26.159
Kasha?

38:35.413 --> 38:37.005
Hello.

38:37.181 --> 38:38.648
What are you doing here?

38:40.751 --> 38:42.343
I don't know.

38:45.323 --> 38:47.348
You telling me there's
not one condo available...

38:47.525 --> 38:49.584
...in all of Del Bofa--
Del-- Del Boca Vista?

38:49.760 --> 38:50.749
That's right.

38:50.928 --> 38:55.024
In all of Del-- Del-- Del Vista--
Del-- Del Boca Visto?

38:55.199 --> 38:58.293
-In all of Del Besta Bicko?
-That's right.

38:58.469 --> 39:01.336
In all of Del Visto Becko?

39:01.505 --> 39:03.405
-Hey.
-You ought to come over.

39:03.574 --> 39:05.439
Tonight's pipe night.

39:11.782 --> 39:13.545
No, thanks.

39:14.452 --> 39:15.851
Come on.

39:18.656 --> 39:20.521
What happened to your face?

39:20.691 --> 39:22.989
It looks like an old catcher's mitt.

39:25.463 --> 39:27.328
It's-- It's all that s--

39:27.732 --> 39:29.199
Come on.

39:31.102 --> 39:33.195
What did you expect?

39:37.975 --> 39:41.809
-What?
-Your teeth are all brown.

39:43.314 --> 39:44.679
No.

39:44.849 --> 39:46.316
Look away, I'm hideous.

42:17.301 --> 42:18.666
See you.

42:22.806 --> 42:25.775
-Okay, where's my boy?
-Oh, my God.

42:26.510 --> 42:29.035
My George isn't clever enough
to hatch a scheme like this.

42:29.213 --> 42:30.805
You got that right.

42:30.981 --> 42:32.539
What the hell does that mean?

42:41.158 --> 42:43.922
What the hell does that--?

42:46.630 --> 42:48.723
Come on. Okay. Let's go, let's go.

42:48.899 --> 42:51.424
That means whatever the hell
you want it to mean.

42:51.902 --> 42:54.166
You're saying
you want a piece of me?

43:02.580 --> 43:04.411
You saying you want a piece of me?

43:11.589 --> 43:14.683
You saying you want a piece of me?

43:24.301 --> 43:26.895
You want a piece of me?

43:27.605 --> 43:29.038
You got it!
