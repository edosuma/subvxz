All right, class.
For homework,

00:04.129 --> 00:06.548
I want you to translate
all 20 word problems

00:06.548 --> 00:09.301
at the end of the chapter
into algebraic equations.

why can't you get off my back

00:20.187 --> 00:21.939
and solve your own problems?

00:22.814 --> 00:24.650
Well, I love math.

00:24.650 --> 00:26.026

Excuse me, Olive.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.160
Could I see you for a moment?

00:35.160 --> 00:36.662
Sure, Ms. Williams.

00:37.371 --> 00:40.457
Oh, no.
Was I over‐participating?

00:43.085 --> 00:46.213
I am so sorry, Ms. Williams.
It won't happen again.

00:46.213 --> 00:47.673
See that it doesn't.

00:47.673 --> 00:50.175
Although, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

00:50.759 --> 00:53.220
Actually, Olive, it's good news.

00:54.388 --> 00:57.307
In eighth grade,
we start to separate students
into different levels,

00:57.307 --> 00:59.142

00:59.142 --> 01:02.187
I've selected you to be
in the advanced math class.

an advanced math class?

01:10.696 --> 01:12.948
So, tell me.
Is everything okay?

01:12.948 --> 01:14.908
Yes! You won't believe it.

01:14.908 --> 01:17.327
Ms. Williams just
invited me to join

01:17.327 --> 01:19.204
a new advanced math class.

01:19.204 --> 01:21.540
There's an advanced math class?

01:21.540 --> 01:23.375
Yeah. I'm so excited,

01:23.375 --> 01:26.128

are covered in goosebumps.

Advanced math?

01:31.091 --> 01:32.301
Good for you.

01:32.301 --> 01:33.802
I know what you're thinking.

01:33.802 --> 01:35.971
Advanced math sounds terrible.

01:35.971 --> 01:39.016
No, I'm thinking,
why didn't Ms. Williams ask me?

01:39.016 --> 01:41.852
What? I didn't think
you liked math that much.

01:41.852 --> 01:43.979
(scoffs)
Where'd you get that idea?

01:43.979 --> 01:47.316
You told math to go
solve its own problems.

01:47.316 --> 01:49.735
Oh, I know what's happening.

01:49.735 --> 01:52.195
They're probably telling kids
one at a time.

01:52.195 --> 01:53.989
Yeah. Probably.

01:53.989 --> 01:56.992
Anyway, I'm gonna go
call my mom and tell her
the good news.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.202
There it goes again!

02:01.496 --> 02:03.999
Oh, Syd, good.
You're still here.

I mean, where's my head, right?

02:53.173 --> 02:55.509
So, I was just talking to Olive,

02:55.509 --> 02:57.636
and she mentioned that
you invited her to join

02:57.636 --> 02:59.179
an advanced math class.

in high school.

03:03.684 --> 03:04.893
Uh‐huh.

03:04.893 --> 03:06.478
Totally get it. So,

03:06.478 --> 03:09.606
I was just wondering
if you were planning
on inviting me

03:09.606 --> 03:10.732

03:10.732 --> 03:12.442
Actually, I wasn't.

03:18.740 --> 03:21.159
But this new class
is gonna be very challenging.

03:21.159 --> 03:24.162
Ms. Williams, there's something
you should know about me.

03:24.162 --> 03:27.457
When I'm challenged,
I rise to the occasion.

03:27.457 --> 03:29.126
Grrrr!

03:30.627 --> 03:31.962
Are you sure?

03:31.962 --> 03:33.672
Because it's gonna move
pretty fast.

03:33.672 --> 03:35.966
Fast is my only speed.

03:35.966 --> 03:38.385
Again... grrrr!

03:39.302 --> 03:41.680
Well, you do seem
pretty determined.

03:42.305 --> 03:43.515
Tell you what,

03:43.515 --> 03:45.684
let's give it a try.
If it doesn't work out,

03:45.684 --> 03:47.310
you can always go back
to regular math.

03:47.310 --> 03:49.563
You won't have to
worry about that, Ms. Williams.

03:49.563 --> 03:51.731

Wait. Did I just say

You know what?
You should get yourself
a pair of skates

04:13.420 --> 04:15.380

the roller rink together!

your hair looks nice,

of wanting something.

04:58.173 --> 05:01.802
Yes, we have done that
little dance a time or two.

05:01.802 --> 05:04.095
So I'm just gonna ask it.

05:04.095 --> 05:06.056

This is really important to me.

had anything to do with

05:23.323 --> 05:25.450
your giant crush on her,

05:25.450 --> 05:28.119
I might consider
buying them for you.

Okay, fine.

Look at that.
I even use math in my free time!

06:26.261 --> 06:28.805
So, Ms. Williams
did ask you, after all.

06:28.805 --> 06:31.266
Well... let's just say
we had a little talk,

06:31.266 --> 06:33.435
and bottom line, I'm in.

20:17.174 --> 20:18.342
(door closes)

20:18.342 --> 20:19.927
What do you want, Max?

20:19.927 --> 20:23.389
To tell you I'm really,
really sorry about the way
I acted yesterday.

20:23.389 --> 20:26.475
You're cool. You're, like,
the coolest person I know.

20:26.475 --> 20:27.810
Really?

20:27.810 --> 20:30.354
Then why'd you say
the things you did?

20:33.065 --> 20:35.985
Because I can't skate.

20:35.985 --> 20:39.029
I tried, and I just
fell on my face.

20:39.029 --> 20:41.073
That's what this is all about?

20:41.073 --> 20:42.825
Why didn't you just tell me?

20:42.825 --> 20:46.412
I was embarrassed,
and afraid you'd laugh at me.

20:46.412 --> 20:48.497
No way.
I'd never laugh at you.

20:48.497 --> 20:50.958
I would've thought
it was really sweet of you
to try skating

20:50.958 --> 20:52.460
just so you could
hang out with me.

20:52.460 --> 20:55.296
Really? Wow.

20:55.296 --> 20:57.006
My mom was right.

20:57.006 --> 20:58.924
How'd that happen?

21:00.509 --> 21:03.471
Hey, how about I teach you
how to skate?

21:03.471 --> 21:06.056
You'd do that?
That would be great.

21:06.056 --> 21:07.808
But you should know,

21:07.808 --> 21:10.060
every teacher that has
ever tried to help me

21:10.060 --> 21:11.645
has lived to regret it.

21:11.645 --> 21:13.522
(laughs)

21:17.359 --> 21:18.986
Hey, Olive.

21:18.986 --> 21:20.446
Can we talk?

21:20.446 --> 21:23.324
Sorry, I'm busy with
my new best friend.

21:23.324 --> 21:25.826
Math. She gets me.

21:27.995 --> 21:30.331
But I want to apologize.

21:32.416 --> 21:34.668
Olive, I've been
so awful to you.

21:35.669 --> 21:38.964
I just wanted to stay
in this class so badly that...

21:38.964 --> 21:41.008
I took advantage
of our friendship.

21:41.967 --> 21:44.637
And you're right.
Math is your thing.

21:44.637 --> 21:46.138
I should've been happy for you,

21:46.138 --> 21:48.224
instead of making it about me.

21:48.974 --> 21:53.020
Maybe it's time to accept
that I don't need to be
good at everything.

21:53.020 --> 21:56.732
Yeah. You're good at
so many things already.

21:56.732 --> 21:58.901
‐It's almost kind of annoying.
‐(both giggle)

21:58.901 --> 22:01.862
Olive, I'm so sorry.

22:01.862 --> 22:03.531
I so forgive you.

22:03.531 --> 22:06.575
Thank you.
I'll see you at lunch.

22:06.575 --> 22:08.994
What do you mean?
We have class.

22:09.537 --> 22:10.996
I spoke to Ms. Williams,

22:10.996 --> 22:13.874
and I'm switching back
to regular math.

22:13.874 --> 22:16.502
I never should've been in
this class in the first place.

22:16.502 --> 22:17.837
Are you sure?

22:17.837 --> 22:20.673
Yeah. I'm sure.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.925
Okay. But for the record,

22:22.925 --> 22:24.802
math isn't my best friend.

22:24.802 --> 22:28.097
You are.
And math is just gonna
have to get over it.

22:30.140 --> 22:33.644
♪

22:33.644 --> 22:36.647
So, Max, we both know
you're a great boarder,

22:36.647 --> 22:39.149
but skates are different.
Just try and be patient.

22:39.149 --> 22:40.359
Okay.

22:40.359 --> 22:43.863
Now, why don't we just try
standing in the skates first?

22:46.198 --> 22:47.449
See?

22:47.449 --> 22:48.826
There you go!

22:48.826 --> 22:50.452
‐(stumbling)
‐Whoa!

22:50.452 --> 22:51.954
(thuds)

22:53.789 --> 22:55.499
Nailed it!

22:55.499 --> 22:57.251
(laughs)

22:58.627 --> 22:59.795
Here.

23:00.671 --> 23:01.839
Take my hand.

23:06.218 --> 23:08.971
Now just pretend
you're wearing
two tiny skateboards.

23:09.889 --> 23:11.348
(skates clacking)

23:14.018 --> 23:15.269
There you go!

23:15.269 --> 23:16.896
You're gonna get this
in no time.

23:16.896 --> 23:18.772
I don't know.

23:18.772 --> 23:20.941
I have a feeling
this is gonna take a while.
