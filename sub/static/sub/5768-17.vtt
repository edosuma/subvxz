what has tried *

00:22.150 --> 00:25.483
* Swapping your blood
with formaldehyde? *

00:28.390 --> 00:31.484
* Monsters?

00:31.530 --> 00:36.229
* Whiskey-plied voices
cried fratricide *

00:36.270 --> 00:38.465
* Jesus, don't you know
that you could've died? *

00:38.500 --> 00:40.491
(newscaster speaks indistinctly)
* You should've died

00:40.540 --> 00:42.633
* With the monsters what talk

00:42.670 --> 00:44.558
* Monsters what walk the earth

NEWSCASTER:
...one we plan to follow closely
throughout the evening.

00:47.340 --> 00:49.672
* And she's got red lipstick

00:49.710 --> 00:52.213
* And a bright pair
of shoes... *

00:52.250 --> 00:54.616
Zach, seriously.

00:54.650 --> 00:56.538
Why aren't
you serious with me?

00:56.590 --> 00:59.457
Iam.

00:59.490 --> 01:01.151
It's really
not that far away.

01:01.190 --> 01:03.420
Yeah, well,
college changes people.

01:03.460 --> 01:05.155
You sound so old.

01:05.190 --> 01:06.726
You're going to be
going to college, too.

01:06.760 --> 01:09.399
Yeah, well,
not till next year.

01:09.430 --> 01:10.658
Then we'll both change.

01:10.700 --> 01:12.691
* In her eyes for you...

01:15.500 --> 01:16.501
Mom's home!

01:16.540 --> 01:18.303
Yes, Mom's home.

01:18.340 --> 01:19.637
Put your clothes on.

01:19.680 --> 01:20.874
NEWSCASTER:
And now onto local...

01:20.910 --> 01:23.447
73% with the precincts
reporting...

01:23.480 --> 01:25.607
ZACH:
Hey, Mom.

01:25.650 --> 01:27.641
NISA:
Mrs. Florrick, how are you?

01:27.680 --> 01:28.612
I'm good.

01:28.650 --> 01:30.208
How are we doing in here?

01:30.250 --> 01:32.616
We're just watching
the results.

01:32.660 --> 01:33.615
Dad hasn't won yet.

01:33.660 --> 01:34.410
Uh, they say they won't

01:34.460 --> 01:36.325
have the results
in till tomorrow.

01:36.360 --> 01:37.452
Yeah, but he's ahead.

01:37.490 --> 01:38.582
Maddie's down
by five percent.

01:38.630 --> 01:39.551
Mm-hmm.

01:39.600 --> 01:40.624
And Kresteva?

01:40.660 --> 01:42.696
He won the
Republican primary,

01:42.730 --> 01:44.266
so Dad knows who he's
got to beat, anyway.

01:44.300 --> 01:45.619
NISA:
Uh, Mrs. Florrick, my parents

01:45.670 --> 01:47.160
want Zach _to come _over
tomorrow night for dInner.

01:47.200 --> 01:48.337
(phone ringing)
Is that all right?

01:48.370 --> 01:49.564
I'm sure it's fine.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.339
Just have your parents call me.

01:51.370 --> 01:53.577
Mom, there's someone
on the phone for you.

01:53.610 --> 01:55.703
Janie Ludwig.

01:55.740 --> 01:57.469
You should be studying
in the same room.

01:57.510 --> 01:59.512
(news program continues
in background)

02:01.480 --> 02:02.879
Janie, hi.

02:02.920 --> 02:05.115
Everything okay?

02:06.660 --> 02:07.854
What?

02:10.260 --> 02:11.522
Alicia.

02:11.560 --> 02:12.697
Janie, how are you?

02:12.730 --> 02:14.721
I'm good.

02:14.760 --> 02:15.829
I'm not good, actually.

02:15.860 --> 02:18.397
I don't know why
I just said that.

02:18.430 --> 02:19.897
The insurance lawyer is here.

02:19.940 --> 02:21.862
He made me so angry
I had to step outside.

02:21.900 --> 02:23.936
Janie, you don't need
to be here. Go home.

02:23.970 --> 02:25.767
Roger always said my best
quality was my toughness,

02:25.810 --> 02:28.699
and I'm not going to let
him down, not now.

02:28.740 --> 02:30.640
Okay.

02:34.650 --> 02:35.674
Mr. Hobson?

02:35.720 --> 02:37.540
I love you, too, dear.

02:37.590 --> 02:39.956
No, this shouldn't
take long.

02:39.990 --> 02:41.912
The other side doesn't
have a leg to stand on.

02:41.960 --> 02:44.224
See you in about two hours.

02:44.260 --> 02:45.579
(phone beeps off)
Hello, Wilk Hobson.

02:45.630 --> 02:47.723
I'm so sorry about
your client's loss.

02:47.760 --> 02:49.625
Yes, but not
sorry enough to pay out

02:49.670 --> 02:50.921
her life insurance policy.

02:50.970 --> 02:52.892
My client, Wolf & Bland,
has some questions

02:52.940 --> 02:54.760
about the untimely death.

02:54.800 --> 02:55.767
Justice Ludwig
died in a car accident.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.836
I'm not sure how _much
more "accrdental" It gets.

02:57.870 --> 02:58.859
Justice Ludwig was talking

02:58.910 --> 03:00.775
on his cell
phone while driving

03:00.810 --> 03:03.540
and his car wasn't
Bluetooth enabled.

03:03.580 --> 03:05.468
Which isn't required
in Illinois.

03:05.510 --> 03:06.545
It speaks
to recklessness.

03:06.580 --> 03:09.481
Which is specifically
excluded from his policy.

03:09.520 --> 03:12.284
Which might be relevant,
had he been hang gliding.

03:12.320 --> 03:14.618
Wolf & Bland believes
the coroner's inquest

03:14.660 --> 03:15.809
will find in our favor,

03:15.860 --> 03:18.249
but we're willing
to pay ten percent

03:18.290 --> 03:19.655
to avoid the uncertainty.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.258
$200,000,
how's that sound?

03:21.300 --> 03:23.564
On a $2 million policy?

03:23.600 --> 03:24.965
(chuckling):
No, thanks.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.434
Ha-ha, more than usual.

03:27.470 --> 03:30.439
Yeah, most people
have trouble finding us

03:30.470 --> 03:31.732
down here in the basement.

03:31.770 --> 03:34.807
I'm, uh, sorry
for the cold in here.

03:34.840 --> 03:38.378
That's the way we ride
in the coroner's office.

03:38.410 --> 03:41.243
This is an inquest
as to the cause of the death

03:41.280 --> 03:42.816
of Illinois Supreme
Court Justice

03:42.850 --> 03:45.239
Roger Ludwig.

03:45.290 --> 03:48.487
Case file 591-R.

03:48.520 --> 03:52.957
Six jurors have been seated
from the regular jury pool.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.422
Welcome.

03:54.460 --> 03:56.690
I want to
stress that this

03:56.730 --> 03:58.823
is not a regular trial.

03:58.870 --> 04:03.034
Now, an inquest is merely
a fact-finding proceeding

04:03.070 --> 04:04.708
to answer the question:

04:04.740 --> 04:08.733
what is the cause and
the manner of death?

04:08.780 --> 04:12.443
So, uh, I will call
our first witness.

04:12.480 --> 04:14.471
The immediate cause of death:

04:14.520 --> 04:15.509
bleeding and trauma,

04:15.550 --> 04:16.414
_due to massive
Internal Injuries.

04:16.450 --> 04:19.283
Can you tell us
what, if any, substances

04:19.320 --> 04:21.550
you found in
the decedent's system?

04:21.590 --> 04:24.787
The toxicology report
was positive for cytrophynal,

04:24.830 --> 04:25.922
as well as alcohol.

04:25.960 --> 04:27.689
That's a lie.

04:27.730 --> 04:29.493
I know, we'll address it.
And did you
test for blood alcohol?

04:29.530 --> 04:31.066
Yes, it was .06.

04:31.100 --> 04:32.692
Thank you, Ms. Patel.

04:32.740 --> 04:33.991
Excuse me,
Mr. Coroner,

04:34.040 --> 04:35.769
may I ask a question?

04:35.800 --> 04:38.064
You... Who are you?

04:38.110 --> 04:39.737
Alicia Florrick,
Mr. Coroner.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.077
I represent the wife
of the deceased.

04:41.110 --> 04:44.045
Ah, yes, the wife of the
state's attorney

04:44.080 --> 04:46.514
in the one county
that's seen fit to do away

04:46.550 --> 04:48.939
with the office of
the coroner altogether.

04:48.980 --> 04:50.311
Please, probe away.

04:50.350 --> 04:51.681
Thank you.

04:51.720 --> 04:55.850
Ms. Patel, .06 BAC is below

04:55.890 --> 04:57.551
thelegal
intoxication limit, isn't it?
It is.

04:57.590 --> 05:00.957
.06 would be consistent
with the judge, having say,

05:01.000 --> 05:02.922
two glasses of wine,
with dinner,

05:02.970 --> 05:05.427
an hour before
the accident?

05:05.470 --> 05:07.461
Based on his weight
of 192 pounds,

05:07.500 --> 05:08.865
I suppose that's about right.

05:08.900 --> 05:11.460
And the cytrophynal,
a medication

05:11.510 --> 05:12.875
used to treat insomnia.

05:12.910 --> 05:15.105
Could there not be
residual traces of it

05:15.140 --> 05:16.107
from the night before?

05:16.140 --> 05:17.903
Yes, uh, cytrophynal can

05:17.950 --> 05:20.373
linger in the system
for several days.

05:20.420 --> 05:21.876
So, therefore, could Justice...

05:21.920 --> 05:22.909
I'm
5
o
rry
, m
al
a
m
I

05:22.950 --> 05:24.645
you've asked your
three questions.

05:24.690 --> 05:26.419
I...

05:26.460 --> 05:27.757
I'm sorry?

05:27.790 --> 05:29.883
You've asked
your three questions.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.921
Attorneys in an inquest
are permitted

05:31.960 --> 05:34.497
to ask questions,
but only a total of three.

05:34.530 --> 05:35.519
Really?

05:35.560 --> 05:36.993
Sorry.

05:37.030 --> 05:38.497
What if I'm fast?

05:38.530 --> 05:41.135
(chuckling)
No, I'm sorry.

05:41.170 --> 05:43.058
I'll have to ask you
to take your seat.

05:43.110 --> 05:44.907
HOBSON:
Uh, Mr. Claypool,

05:44.940 --> 05:46.009
I'm Wilk Hobson,

05:46.040 --> 05:48.679
counsel for
Wolf & Bland Insurance.

05:48.710 --> 05:50.598
Unlike Mrs. Florrick,

05:50.650 --> 05:52.447
I have just one
question, if that's okay.

05:52.480 --> 05:53.572
Yes, certainly.
Please.

05:53.620 --> 05:55.076
Ms. Patel,
in your opinion,

05:55.120 --> 05:57.509
can the amount of alcohol
that results

05:57.550 --> 05:59.450
in a .06 BAC still be enough

05:59.490 --> 06:00.980
to impair
someone's judgment...

06:01.020 --> 06:02.851
Objection,
goes beyond the scope.

06:02.890 --> 06:04.118
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
Mrs. Florrick,

06:04.160 --> 06:07.027
as I said before,
this is not a regular trial.

06:07.060 --> 06:09.028
There are no objections here.

06:13.070 --> 06:14.560
Will Gardner, please.

06:14.600 --> 06:17.398
Are you sure?

06:17.440 --> 06:18.600
No.

06:18.640 --> 06:20.835
Well, I'm just as
unfamiliar as Alic...

06:20.880 --> 06:21.835
Okay, I'll see you then.

06:21.880 --> 06:22.949
What was that?

06:22.980 --> 06:24.743
Janie Ludwig.

06:24.780 --> 06:26.099
Her husband's inquest.
Oh, yes,

06:26.150 --> 06:27.117
that car crash.

06:27.150 --> 06:28.469
It was horrible.

06:28.520 --> 06:29.885
How is she?
Upset.

06:29.920 --> 06:31.842
She wants me to help
Alicia at the inquest.

06:31.890 --> 06:33.152
Well, that sounds right.
What's the problem?

06:33.190 --> 06:35.511
Nothing. What's up?

06:35.560 --> 06:37.881
An invitation to the
Chicago Shamrock Dinner.

06:37.930 --> 06:39.625
We've been
asked to buy a table.

06:39.660 --> 06:40.854
They've never
invited us before.

06:40.900 --> 06:41.889
I know,
we're moving up in the world.

06:41.930 --> 06:43.818
And with
Alicia's husband there,

06:43.870 --> 06:45.462
it might be a slap
in the face if we say no.

06:45.500 --> 06:46.831
Peter didn't win yet, did he?

06:46.870 --> 06:49.088
The last I heard it
was neck and neck
between him and Maddie.

06:49.140 --> 06:52.029
I'll wait to see if he wins
before buying a table.

06:52.070 --> 06:53.435
DIANE:
Cary.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.038
Yes, you needed me?

06:55.080 --> 06:57.446
Congratulations.
What fantastic news.

06:57.480 --> 06:59.004
WILL:
Talk about landing
the big fish, good job.

06:59.050 --> 07:00.017
I...

07:00.050 --> 07:01.119
We weren't
even trying for

07:01.150 --> 07:02.913
Emmonds Pharmaceuticals.

07:02.950 --> 07:04.747
We thought they were
deep into Canning's pocket.

07:04.790 --> 07:05.814
How'd you do it?

07:09.060 --> 07:10.982
Well, I'm just
one part of a team.
That's not what I heard.

07:11.030 --> 07:13.624
Their chief counsel said it was
all because of you.

07:13.660 --> 07:14.797
DIANE:
This is a good way

07:14.830 --> 07:16.468
to stay on the equity
partner track, Cary.

07:16.500 --> 07:18.627
$5 million a year
in litigation costs?

07:18.670 --> 07:19.637
Pretty impressive.

07:19.670 --> 07:21.092
That's their spokesman now.

07:21.140 --> 07:22.198
He's in your office, Cary.

07:22.240 --> 07:24.162
He wants to say hello.
Okay.

07:24.210 --> 07:25.666
Emmonds Pharmaceuticals.

07:25.710 --> 07:28.099
Yes, good job.
(laughing)

07:37.050 --> 07:39.814
Hello.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.009
Dad?

07:41.060 --> 07:41.981
Cary.

07:42.020 --> 07:44.250
Sir, hi.

07:44.290 --> 07:46.497
This is a surprise.

07:46.530 --> 07:47.997
I hope so.

07:48.030 --> 07:50.498
And this is a very cool office.

07:50.530 --> 07:53.135
You have a view, two desks,

07:53.170 --> 07:54.967
you're on the same floor
as the partners.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.729
I'm impressed.

07:56.770 --> 07:58.135
Yeah, thanks, Dad.
So, what's going on?

07:58.170 --> 07:59.728
Well, I'm back in Chicago.

07:59.780 --> 08:00.576
Yeah.

08:00.610 --> 08:02.100
Sorry about that
press secretary job.

08:02.140 --> 08:03.903
No, no, no, look.

08:03.950 --> 08:05.042
That was inappropriate of me

08:05.080 --> 08:06.240
to even ask for that favor.

08:06.280 --> 08:08.919
And I realized that the job
wasn't quite

08:08.950 --> 08:10.042
the right fit
for me anyway.

08:10.090 --> 08:12.046
That's good.
I'm lobbying.

08:12.090 --> 08:13.580
For Emmonds
Pharmaceuticals now.

08:13.620 --> 08:16.054
And we were looking for
a firm to help us draft

08:16.090 --> 08:17.682
_a medical
marijuana statute

08:17.730 --> 08:20.949
to take to the general
assembly, and I...

08:21.000 --> 08:23.218
thought of you.

08:23.270 --> 08:24.965
You thought of me?

08:25.000 --> 08:26.661
Ha,dont
sound so surprised.

08:26.700 --> 08:27.928
Of course I
thought of you.

08:27.970 --> 08:28.994
You're good.

08:29.040 --> 08:30.530
Your firm is hot right now.

08:30.570 --> 08:32.709
A pharmaceutical
company wants to get

08:32.740 --> 08:35.607
__ a medical
marijuana law passed?

08:35.640 --> 08:37.608
Well, right now,
there is a competing

08:37.650 --> 08:39.140
initiative being written.

08:39.180 --> 08:41.717
We _want ours to take
a different approach.

08:41.750 --> 08:43.012
. There'sa. .. .
medical marijuana initiative

08:43.050 --> 08:45.939
being written
and Emmonds is concerned

08:45.990 --> 08:47.651
if it succeeds,
it'll cut into their profits,

08:47.690 --> 08:50.022
so they want to draft
a competing initiative

08:50.060 --> 08:51.129
to confuse the voters?

08:51.160 --> 08:53.128
(chuckling): Come on,
let's not put it like that.

08:53.160 --> 08:55.822
We-w_e want a more
sen5ible initiative.

08:55.860 --> 08:56.963
How's that sound?

08:57.000 --> 08:57.967
Sensible.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.991
Good.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.338
I thought that you
could draft the initiative

09:02.370 --> 09:05.635
and then represent us through
the legislative process.

09:07.110 --> 09:08.179
What?

09:08.210 --> 09:10.804
Ijust...

09:10.850 --> 09:12.579
I didn't think you
were going to talk to me again.

09:12.620 --> 09:16.044
(sighs):
Cary.

09:16.080 --> 09:17.911
You're my only son.

09:17.950 --> 09:19.781
_I'm never not
gomg to talk to you.

09:21.160 --> 09:23.822
NEWSWOMAN: We are now confident
reporting the projected

09:23.860 --> 09:26.055
Democratic primary winner
for Illinois governor

09:26.090 --> 09:28.058
is going to be State's Attorney
Peter Florrick.

09:28.100 --> 09:31.024
(cheering loudly)
Congratulations, sir.

09:31.070 --> 09:33.994
I said-said _
congratulations, Sir.

09:34.040 --> 09:36.838
Now we turn to Kresteva.

09:36.870 --> 09:40.374
I said now we turn
to Kresteva!

09:40.410 --> 09:43.106
Sir, I wanted to talk
to you about Jordan.

09:43.150 --> 09:45.641
I don't
think we need him.

09:45.680 --> 09:47.614
Are you sure?

09:47.650 --> 09:49.277
Because I think we're losing
our singularity of purpose.

09:50.350 --> 09:52.341
(whoops)
Yeah.

09:52.390 --> 09:53.709
No, I understand.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.284
Okay, okay.

09:55.320 --> 09:56.821
Good job, Eli.

09:56.860 --> 09:58.851
Well done.

09:58.890 --> 10:00.755
Oh, come on, let's hug.

10:01.360 --> 10:03.396
Now comes the real battle.

10:03.430 --> 10:05.068
Now it comes.

10:05.100 --> 10:08.661
On that note, I need
to show you something.

10:08.700 --> 10:10.167
Zach Florrick
has a girlfriend.

10:10.210 --> 10:11.962
Her name is Nisa Dalmar.

10:12.010 --> 10:13.170
I know, she's black.

10:13.210 --> 10:14.302
It's all fine.

10:14.340 --> 10:16.843
No, that's not it.

10:16.880 --> 10:19.041
Did you see this photo
that she tweeted today?

10:19.080 --> 10:20.411
It's a
Milad-un-Nabi festival.

10:20.450 --> 10:22.270
It's a celebration
of the Prophet's birth.

10:22.320 --> 10:24.845
I did a deeper
check into Nisa's father.

10:24.890 --> 10:27.313
He donated to the _
Hamas charity organization,

10:27.360 --> 10:28.657
Mouharib Mousalim.

10:28.690 --> 10:29.987
VVhen?

10:30.030 --> 10:31.429
His last
donation was in 2008.

10:31.460 --> 10:35.123
And Mouharib Mousalim was just
put on the treasury's list

10:35.160 --> 10:38.129
for terrorist affiliations
this past October.

10:41.770 --> 10:43.067
What?

10:43.110 --> 10:45.305
We should do
something about it.

10:47.240 --> 10:49.231
As you can see,
the skid marks on the road

10:49.280 --> 10:50.247
reveal a course COFFECthI’l.

10:50.280 --> 10:52.669
Uh, using the formula for
minimum skid speed

10:52.720 --> 10:54.870
we determined he
was driving roughly

10:54.920 --> 10:56.114
55 miles per hour,

10:56.150 --> 10:57.811
which is ten miles
over the speed limit.

10:57.850 --> 11:00.353
Speeding
equals reckless driving.

11:00.390 --> 11:02.881
Uh, Mr. Gardner.

11:02.930 --> 11:05.819
Time for the main event.
WILL (quietly):
I'm not here to replace you.

11:05.860 --> 11:08.420
Mrs. Ludwig just asked me
to assist, that's all.
It's okay.

11:08.460 --> 11:10.064
We, uh, recovered Justice
Ludwig's cell phone,

11:10.100 --> 11:12.739
which he was using
at the time of the crash.

11:12.770 --> 11:15.432
Um, that may also have
contributed to the accident.

11:15.470 --> 11:18.166
Anything from the gallery?
WILL:
Yes, sir, if I may.

11:18.210 --> 11:20.929
And you are?
Will Gardner.
I'm also on Mrs. Ludwig's

11:20.980 --> 11:22.436
legal team.
(quietly):
You only get three questions.

11:22.480 --> 11:24.243
You can only ask
three questions.

11:24.280 --> 11:25.747
CLAYPOOL:
She has a legal
team now.

11:25.780 --> 11:27.714
(chuckles)
This is getting serious.

11:27.750 --> 11:31.288
Proceed.
I, uh...

11:31.320 --> 11:33.185
Although there was
no Bluetooth

11:33.220 --> 11:37.452
in Justice Ludwig's car,
his phone had a speaker function

11:37.490 --> 11:40.220
making it possible for him to...

11:40.260 --> 11:43.161
make a call and not hold
his cell phone while driving...

11:43.200 --> 11:45.794
isn't that right?
Yes,

11:45.830 --> 11:48.196
but we have no way of knowing
if he was actually holding it

11:48.240 --> 11:50.299
or not.
Okay, but
rather than...

11:50.340 --> 11:54.436
the use of a phone
or the speed he was traveling,

11:54.480 --> 11:58.007
couldn't the presence
of black ice on the road

11:58.050 --> 11:59.301
have forced Justice Ludwig

11:59.350 --> 12:03.081
to make the course correction,
sending him into the guardrail,

12:03.120 --> 12:04.485
which by its mere presence

12:04.520 --> 12:07.887
implies this is a very sharp
curve in the road?

12:07.920 --> 12:12.152
Objection. Mr. Gardner is
combining several questions...
As I've said,

12:12.190 --> 12:14.158
Mr. Hobson, there are
no objections here.

12:14.200 --> 12:16.225
_ Officer? _
Taking the p0ints
one at a time,

12:16.260 --> 12:19.969
uh, guardrails are placed by
the Department of Transportation

12:20.000 --> 12:21.433
for various reasons, sir.

12:21.470 --> 12:24.359
And, yes, I observed black ice
on the road that night,

12:24.410 --> 12:26.366
but with those
road conditions,

12:26.410 --> 12:29.402
the victim should have been
driving under the speed limit.
Excuse me.

12:29.440 --> 12:32.841
Mr. Coroner, I would like
to reserve our third question.

12:32.880 --> 12:35.417
Objec... Uh, point of...
clarification.

12:35.450 --> 12:37.247
Uh, can he do that?

12:37.290 --> 12:40.259
I don't see why not.

12:40.290 --> 12:44.078
Now, Officer, let's talk
some more about this black ice.

12:44.130 --> 12:45.882
(camera shutter clicking)

12:45.930 --> 12:47.488
(phone ringing, vibrating)

12:53.000 --> 12:54.968
Hello?

12:55.000 --> 12:56.968
Oh, yeah, this is Robyn,
Mrs. Florrick,

12:57.010 --> 12:58.432
the other investigator
you hired.

12:58.470 --> 13:00.904
Oh, hi. How are you?
Good, good.

13:00.940 --> 13:03.477
Cold. Uh, I saw Kalinda's phone
ringing and I picked it up.

13:03.510 --> 13:05.478
Do you want me
to ask her something?
Yes.

13:05.510 --> 13:07.876
Ask her, is there anything
that can point to an accident

13:07.920 --> 13:09.069
and not recklessness?

13:09.120 --> 13:10.246
We're questioning
the officer right now.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.439
Hold on, Mrs. Florrick.

13:11.490 --> 13:13.856
Thanks.

13:13.890 --> 13:16.882
Hi, uh...

13:17.930 --> 13:20.319
Look, can I call you back?

13:21.560 --> 13:23.391
Yeah, I know.
I saw that.

13:23.430 --> 13:25.523
It's weird, huh?

13:25.570 --> 13:27.390
OFFICER:
...which is why

13:27.440 --> 13:29.829
we concluded that, uh, black ice
was not a likely cause.

13:29.870 --> 13:31.167
CLAYPOOL:
Very well.

13:31.210 --> 13:32.268
Thank you, Officer.

13:32.310 --> 13:34.073
Mr. Claypool,
may I ask a question?
Mr. Gardner

13:34.110 --> 13:35.475
has already asked
all the questions

13:35.510 --> 13:37.307
for Mrs. Ludwig's legal team,
Mr. Coroner.

13:37.350 --> 13:39.238
No, not all. We have one left.

13:39.280 --> 13:40.042
That is correct.

13:40.080 --> 13:42.071
Ask your question,
Mrs. Florrick.

13:42.120 --> 13:45.089
Officer Rivera...

13:45.120 --> 13:47.054
has the county been replacing

13:47.090 --> 13:50.389
the dimmer, orange incandescent
streetlights on that road

13:50.430 --> 13:52.352
with the brighter LED. lights,

13:52.390 --> 13:54.893
which would mean
that the night of the accident,

13:54.930 --> 13:57.023
in the hundred yards
preceding the bend

13:57.070 --> 13:58.389
in the road, the judge

13:58.430 --> 14:00.864
entered a darker stretch
that doesn't show

14:00.900 --> 14:02.390
the black ice as well,

14:02.440 --> 14:04.305
resulting in
the judge having

14:04.340 --> 14:06.900
to make a last-second
course correction?

14:11.410 --> 14:12.911
Yes.

14:12.950 --> 14:14.269
Thank you.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.380
Looks like an
accident to me.

14:17.420 --> 14:19.388
Mr. Hobson, any questions?

14:19.420 --> 14:23.379
Officer Rivera, upon looking
into the cell phone records,

14:23.430 --> 14:26.388
did you determine the call
the judge was making

14:26.430 --> 14:27.988
at the time of the accident?

14:28.030 --> 14:29.224
Yes, he'd called his voice mail.

14:29.260 --> 14:32.127
And from whom did he rec_eive
v0ice mail messages that night?

14:32.170 --> 14:33.467
There was only one.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.661
It was from the Illinois
Attorney General's office.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.429
Uh, their anti-corruption unit.

14:37.470 --> 14:39.233
Last question then.
To your knowledge,

14:39.270 --> 14:41.204
what does this anti-corruption

14:41.240 --> 14:42.946
unit investigate?

14:42.980 --> 14:43.901
Uh, public officials

14:43.950 --> 14:46.942
for, uh, corruption
and ethics violations.

14:46.980 --> 14:48.618
Mr. Coroner, I'm aware
that only you can

14:48.650 --> 14:52.017
introduce evidence, but it is
our belief that the deceased

14:52.050 --> 14:55.486
ran his car off the road in
an attempt to commit suicide.
WILL: Oh, come on.

14:55.520 --> 14:56.919
He can't just
spin a story

14:56.960 --> 14:58.621
in front of the jury.
Mr. Gardner,

14:58.660 --> 15:01.197
please. What evidence?

15:01.230 --> 15:03.266
Evidence regarding
the judge's last weeks,

15:03.300 --> 15:06.963
when he discovered that he was
being investigated for bribery.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.638
This is outrageous,
Mr. Coroner.

15:08.670 --> 15:11.503
Mr. Hobson is trying to void
a life insurance policy--

15:11.540 --> 15:14.429
that's the only reason
he's arguing for suicide.
Not at all.

15:14.480 --> 15:16.436
Like Mrs. Ludwig's
abundant legal team,

15:16.480 --> 15:18.448
I'm just trying to get
to the truth here.
CLAYPOOL:
Okay.

15:18.480 --> 15:22.177
Whether it is or is not
outrageous, I will decide.

15:22.220 --> 15:23.517
Please have your evidence

15:23.550 --> 15:27.281
ready tomorrow,
and I will review.

15:41.470 --> 15:45.133
What'd I do?
Nothing. We thought
we would just talk.

15:45.170 --> 15:47.309
You've been doing great work
with I.T., Zach.

15:47.340 --> 15:48.978
We are really
thrilled.

15:49.010 --> 15:50.648
Okay.

15:51.580 --> 15:53.514
So, you and your girlfriend,

15:53.550 --> 15:55.108
Y-YOU're pretty serious, right?

15:55.150 --> 15:56.981
Yeah.

15:57.020 --> 15:58.180
This is about Nisa?

15:58.220 --> 15:59.244
JORDAN:
No. Well...

15:59.290 --> 16:00.712
a little.

16:00.760 --> 16:03.058
I remember my first
girlfriend in high school.

16:03.090 --> 16:04.182
She meant everything to me.

16:04.230 --> 16:05.458
Nisa's not my first girlfriend.

16:05.490 --> 16:07.128
Oh. Well...

16:07.160 --> 16:08.593
that's good to know.

16:08.630 --> 16:11.599
Do you mind if, uh,
I show you a tweet

16:11.630 --> 16:13.166
that your girlfriend sent out?
(phone vibrates)

16:13.200 --> 16:15.998
Uh, wh-what tweet?
Yeah.

16:16.040 --> 16:17.598
(groans)
Okay.

16:17.640 --> 16:19.608
What, right now?
Okay, okay.

16:19.640 --> 16:22.074
They need me to change
something in the stump.

16:22.110 --> 16:24.101
I'll be right back.

16:26.210 --> 16:28.474
I can't believe you're
trying to break them up.

16:28.520 --> 16:32.149
Do you see me doing
anything? Hmm?

16:32.190 --> 16:34.158
JORDAN:
See, the thing is,

16:34.190 --> 16:37.159
Zach, that... you
have to start thinking

16:37.190 --> 16:40.421
about all your relationships
in relation to the campaign.

16:40.460 --> 16:44.169
'Cause there is already a
spotlight on your mom and dad.

16:44.200 --> 16:46.191
(quietly):
See if they're done.

16:46.230 --> 16:47.766
(quietly):
I'm not seeing if they're done.

16:47.800 --> 16:50.234
Nora, I am the boss.
You are the...

16:50.270 --> 16:52.033
Oh, Zach,

16:52.070 --> 16:53.571
is everything all right?
What's wrong?

16:53.610 --> 16:55.601
It's nothing. I'm fine.

16:55.640 --> 16:58.677
What is it? What'd he say?

16:59.680 --> 17:01.568
Mrs. Florrick.

17:01.620 --> 17:04.589
Mr. Agos, I heard we were
representing you now.
Yes,

17:04.620 --> 17:08.215
well, I figured, anything I
could do to help Cary, why not?

17:08.260 --> 17:10.524
You know, I saw your name
listed with the partners.

17:10.560 --> 17:12.482
Aren't you the same year
as Cary?
Well,

17:12.530 --> 17:14.327
we came in together,
but then Cary left

17:14.360 --> 17:16.328
and came back again,
and we're thriléed to have him.
0

17:16.360 --> 17:18.225
he's not on the partner track?

17:18.270 --> 17:20.238
No, no. I'm, um... Yes.

17:20.270 --> 17:22.261
He definitely
will be. Soon.
Dad.

17:22.300 --> 17:24.268
Hi, son. I got sidetracked
with Alicia.

17:24.310 --> 17:27.234
You know, it's fantastic
how quickly she made partner.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.601
And if that doesn't
light a fire under you,

17:29.640 --> 17:31.141
I don't know what will.

17:31.180 --> 17:32.602
(woman sighs)

17:32.650 --> 17:34.413
Christie Yeargin.
I've been an investigator

17:34.450 --> 17:37.180
at the Illinois Attorney
General's office for six years.

17:37.220 --> 17:39.211
Apologies for the
temperature in here, ma'am.

17:39.250 --> 17:42.083
I've asked for_ some
space heaters in here.
(chuckles)

17:42.120 --> 17:44.224
Now, you were in charge

17:44.260 --> 17:48.128
of the investigation into
Justice Roger Ludwig?
Yes.

17:48.160 --> 17:49.650
Ms. Yeargin,
what was the basis

17:49.700 --> 17:51.861
for the investigation
into Justice Ludwig?

17:51.900 --> 17:53.595
We had him pegged
as a bribery target.

17:53.640 --> 17:54.789
I see. Did this
have anything to do

17:54.840 --> 17:55.636
with his participation

17:55.670 --> 17:57.399
in a Wednesday night
basketball game

17:57.440 --> 18:00.671
with Mr. Gardner
over here?
Yes and no.

18:00.710 --> 18:02.405
We started looking
into the deceased

18:02.440 --> 18:04.806
because of the basketball
games, but...

18:04.850 --> 18:06.499
we continued our investigation

18:06.550 --> 18:09.474
because of Justice Ludwig's
financial troubles.

18:12.390 --> 18:14.813
You have only one more question,
Mr. Hobson.

18:14.860 --> 18:16.816
Yes. Thank you.

18:16.860 --> 18:19.385
Ms. Yeargin,
during your investigation

18:19.430 --> 18:21.523
of Justice Ludwig, would you say

18:21.560 --> 18:24.199
that the combination
of this attention,

18:24.230 --> 18:26.494
along with his obviously
precarious finances,

18:26.530 --> 18:29.795
was making him depressed--
depressed enough, in fact,

18:29.840 --> 18:32.206
to do something desperate,
something like suicide?

18:32.240 --> 18:33.832
YEARGIN: Well, he wasn't
happy about it.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.575
But beyond that, I couldn't say.

18:35.610 --> 18:38.579
(sighs)
Nice speech, Mr. Hobson.

18:38.610 --> 18:41.374
Way to hit the suicide theme.

18:41.420 --> 18:42.546
Ms. Yeargin,
how many judges

18:42.580 --> 18:45.344
does the Attorney General's
office investigate every year?

18:45.390 --> 18:46.584
Depends on the year.

18:46.620 --> 18:50.226
Oh, we're always looking for
potential corruption targets.

18:50.260 --> 18:51.921
And how many of these
investigations actually bear...

18:51.960 --> 18:56.351
Strike that. How many times
does your investigation

18:56.400 --> 18:59.369
actually lead to charges
being filed against the judge?

18:59.400 --> 19:01.265
Thankfully, not very often.
And in this case,

19:01.300 --> 19:03.632
you didn't have
any solid evidence

19:03.670 --> 19:06.468
that Justice Ludwig had actually
accepted a bribe, did you?

19:06.510 --> 19:08.273
Not yet,
but we were working on it.

19:08.310 --> 19:10.301
And did you feel that...
Ah.

19:10.350 --> 19:12.341
Thank you. Nothing further.

19:12.380 --> 19:15.918
Uh... you're sure you don't
want to wait for Kalinda?

19:15.950 --> 19:18.418
No, we have
to get back to...

19:18.450 --> 19:20.418
the morgue.
It's okay, Robyn.

19:20.460 --> 19:22.917
We just need a rundown
on the facts.

19:22.960 --> 19:25.588
Okay, um...

19:25.630 --> 19:28.758
well, the Ludwigs, they-they did
have financial problems.

19:28.800 --> 19:31.598
And as far as we can tell,
Mr. Ludwig-- Justice Ludwig--

19:31.630 --> 19:33.939
kept them from his wife--
the money troubles.

19:33.970 --> 19:37.360
And the bribery investigation
is based on a lawyer

19:37.410 --> 19:38.229
who was accused
of bribing judges.

19:38.270 --> 19:39.703
It's okay. We don't need
to go into that.

19:39.740 --> 19:41.970
Okay. Um,

19:42.010 --> 19:44.444
the justice's last day:
he had dinner that night

19:44.480 --> 19:46.846
at 8:00 pm. with a friend.
Jared Bigelow, a lobbyist.

19:46.880 --> 19:49.246
And... Oh, we were able
to download the judge's I-PASS.

19:49.280 --> 19:50.178
Do you know what that is?

19:50.220 --> 19:52.381
From the Tri-State Tollway?
Yes, we do.

19:52.420 --> 19:53.387
Well, the last record
we could find

19:53.420 --> 19:55.911
is that he exited the tollway
at 10:37 pm,

19:55.960 --> 19:58.724
but what's strange
is the accident was at 11:42.

19:58.760 --> 20:00.318
And why is that strange?

20:00.360 --> 20:02.851
It took him an hour
to travel four miles.

20:04.970 --> 20:06.722
You checked where
he might've stopped?

20:06.770 --> 20:08.328
There are only two options
at that exit:

20:08.370 --> 20:10.838
a gas station and a motel.

20:12.440 --> 20:16.536
Let's not update Mrs. Ludwig
on this until we know for sure.

20:16.580 --> 20:18.400
But keep up the good work.

20:19.450 --> 20:20.644
JEFFREY:
The application fee

20:20.680 --> 20:23.581
for a marijuana
dispensary

20:23.620 --> 20:26.589
increases from $2,000 to $5,000.
That's good. The license fee

20:26.620 --> 20:28.588
ought to increase as well
though, don't you think?

20:28.620 --> 20:30.019
I didn't want to get greedy.

20:30.060 --> 20:31.482
It's good for the state budget.

20:31.530 --> 20:33.794
Well... (sighs)
I think...

20:33.830 --> 20:35.798
it might start to seem obvious

20:35.830 --> 20:37.821
_ that the initiative
isn't exactly genume.

20:38.630 --> 20:40.439
Dispensary

20:40.470 --> 20:42.938
locations to be
at least 300 yards away

20:42.970 --> 20:45.438
from the nearest school.
We should change that to 500.

20:45.470 --> 20:48.405
We're the third-largest
school district in the country.

20:48.440 --> 20:50.032
If you make it 500...
It makes it

20:50.080 --> 20:52.298
more difficult to find
a location for a shop.

20:52.350 --> 20:53.578
It makes it transparent
that the law

20:53.620 --> 20:54.917
isn't about medical marijuana.

20:54.950 --> 20:56.611
It's about protecting
your market.

20:57.650 --> 20:59.845
Do we have some problem here?

21:01.520 --> 21:03.488
I don't think so.

21:03.530 --> 21:07.398
Maybe we should ask a partner
to sit in, help supervise.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.568
Sure.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.591
If that's what you want.

21:14.970 --> 21:16.562
KALINDA:
Hi.

21:16.600 --> 21:18.465
Would you two like a room?

21:19.510 --> 21:21.478
Uh, no.

21:21.510 --> 21:24.445
I just would like to ask
you some questions.

21:24.480 --> 21:26.971
Am I in some
kind of trouble?

21:27.010 --> 21:28.819
I don't think so.

21:28.850 --> 21:32.445
Were you working here
on the night of March 2?

21:32.490 --> 21:37.018
Um, I work every night except
Tuesday and Sunday, s-so...

21:37.060 --> 21:38.584
So, that's a yes.

21:38.630 --> 21:40.052
Do you remember

21:40.090 --> 21:42.320
if you saw this man that night?

21:42.360 --> 21:45.420
I'm not supposed to give
information out about our guests

21:45.470 --> 21:47.563
unless it's to the police.

21:47.600 --> 21:49.534
Are you the police?

21:49.570 --> 21:51.800
No.

21:56.680 --> 21:58.341
Sure.

21:58.380 --> 22:01.042
He was here.
He had a room, paid cash.

22:01.080 --> 22:02.616
Was he with anyone?
He checked in
alone, but...

22:02.650 --> 22:04.481
when he left,
he was with a woman.

22:04.520 --> 22:05.817
A blonde woman.

22:05.850 --> 22:07.556
They were arguing.

22:07.590 --> 22:08.557
Did you hear what
they were yelling?

22:08.590 --> 22:12.128
No. He got into his car,
she got into her SUV.

22:12.160 --> 22:14.492
They both left.
Do you remember
anything

22:14.530 --> 22:16.122
about the SUV?
It was nighttime.

22:16.160 --> 22:20.631
All I could see was that it was
a dark four-door, I think...

22:20.670 --> 22:23.434
Oh, it had... it had
one of those license plates.

22:23.470 --> 22:25.700
Which license plate?
The specialty ones.

22:25.740 --> 22:29.631
I-I didn't see the number,
but it had a bird on it.

22:29.680 --> 22:31.045
Okay.

22:31.080 --> 22:32.502
Thanks.

22:37.520 --> 22:40.080
It's hard to work with
a relative, isn't it?

22:40.120 --> 22:41.712
Not really.

22:41.760 --> 22:42.886
Why?

22:42.920 --> 22:45.650
Your dad. It must
be difficult.

22:45.690 --> 22:48.591
When personal feelings
enter into legal work,

22:48.630 --> 22:50.723
it makes everything
a big emotional stew.

22:50.770 --> 22:53.489
Did I do something?

22:53.540 --> 22:55.394
No, no.

22:55.440 --> 22:57.567
I just think, um...

22:57.610 --> 23:00.579
we want to give the Emmonds
team everything they want.

23:00.610 --> 23:02.430
Defer to them.

23:02.480 --> 23:05.142
It's a good client
to keep happy.

23:05.180 --> 23:06.499
Did my dad talk to you?

23:06.550 --> 23:07.812
That's not important, Cary.

23:07.850 --> 23:11.013
I should keep closer
tabs on this, anyway.

23:11.050 --> 23:13.018
What did he say?
Nothing.

23:13.050 --> 23:14.551
Cary...

23:14.590 --> 23:15.989
everything's fine.

23:16.020 --> 23:18.853
I'd just like to sit in
on the next meeting.

23:18.890 --> 23:21.859
If you don't mind.
No. I don't.

23:21.900 --> 23:23.595
That would be good.

23:23.630 --> 23:25.598
Great. Keep up
the good work.

23:29.800 --> 23:32.462
Last Saturday night?
Yeah. Gas station
on Route 2,

23:32.510 --> 23:34.102
down the road
from the motel.

23:34.140 --> 23:36.700
The attendant said he
couldn't see the road

23:36.740 --> 23:38.674
because your tanker
was blocking his view.

23:38.710 --> 23:40.849
So who are you two,
Cagney and Lacey?

23:40.880 --> 23:42.939
Uh, there was a crash
a few minutes later.

23:42.980 --> 23:45.210
We're just trying to find out
if anyone saw anything.

23:45.250 --> 23:47.855
Sure, I saw something.
What do I get for telling you?

23:47.890 --> 23:50.620
A clear conscience
that you did the right thing.

23:50.660 --> 23:52.082
(chuckles):
Yeah. What else?

24:16.850 --> 24:19.842
I didn't see the crash,
but I saw the cars.
Uh, cars?

24:19.890 --> 24:22.211
There was more than one?
Yes.

24:22.260 --> 24:25.229
There was a sedan in front
and a black SUV behind it.

24:25.260 --> 24:27.251
And it came up fast,
honking the horn,

24:27.290 --> 24:29.520
lights flashing--
it was totally out of control.

24:29.560 --> 24:30.561
Uh, the black SUV?

24:30.600 --> 24:31.692
Yes.

24:31.730 --> 24:32.697
(clears throat)

24:32.730 --> 24:33.936
And I'm sorry

24:33.970 --> 24:35.961
for the way I talked
to you before.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.604
That's okay.

24:38.640 --> 24:40.005
ALICIA:
Who's the woman?

24:40.040 --> 24:42.770
KALINDA (on speakerphone):
We're not sure.
All we know is that she's

24:42.810 --> 24:45.574
blonde, probably in her
405 and that she was
arguing with Ludwig.

24:45.610 --> 24:46.770
WILL:
Sounds like a jilted mistress.

24:46.810 --> 24:48.641
Well, we can't say
definitively.

24:48.680 --> 24:49.840
They had an argument.

24:49.880 --> 24:51.814
Maybe he broke it off,
she wasn't happy.

24:51.850 --> 24:53.909
She chases after him,
drives him off the road.

24:53.960 --> 24:56.611
Do you believe that?
It's not what I believe, it's
what the coroner believes.

24:56.660 --> 24:58.651
He's already intrigued
by suicide-- let's see

24:58.690 --> 25:00.897
if we can intrigue him
with murder. Kalinda,

25:00.930 --> 25:02.921
you line up this motel clerk
as a witness,

25:02.960 --> 25:04.291
and we'll look
for some precedent

25:04.330 --> 25:05.661
for admitting it in an inquest.

25:05.700 --> 25:07.099
Okay. Good.
(phone beeps)

25:07.130 --> 25:10.099
What did you tell that guy?

25:11.140 --> 25:13.529
Come on.

25:13.580 --> 25:15.275
Tell me.

25:24.050 --> 25:26.041
*

25:30.160 --> 25:32.856
* While the people sleep

25:32.890 --> 25:34.755
* I lie awake

25:34.800 --> 25:35.892
* Encased in dreams

25:35.930 --> 25:37.295
* That carry me

25:37.330 --> 25:39.594
* To a distant sound

25:39.630 --> 25:41.598
* To undertake

25:41.640 --> 25:43.267
* I feel its way

25:43.300 --> 25:45.632
* Even though I

25:45.670 --> 25:48.673
* Am helpless of

25:50.140 --> 25:53.769
* The force...

25:53.820 --> 25:55.742
What did you find?

25:55.780 --> 25:57.748
AML v. Hillman.

25:57.790 --> 26:00.008
Yes. That's
what I have.

26:00.050 --> 26:02.359
You do not.

26:02.390 --> 26:03.482
You're right.
What is it?

26:03.520 --> 26:06.785
Lawsuit over a biased inquest--
insufficient evidence.

26:06.830 --> 26:09.355
It'll make the coroner
so afraid of a lawsuit,

26:09.400 --> 26:11.698
he won't dar_e
pass on murder eVIdence.
Good.

26:11.730 --> 26:13.869
You argue it.
Okay.

26:13.900 --> 26:15.629
Will Peter have a problem

26:15.670 --> 26:19.106
if I go to the Chicago
Shamrock Dinner?

26:19.140 --> 26:22.678
Will he have a...
problem with it?

26:22.710 --> 26:24.769
No. Are you going?

26:24.810 --> 26:26.346
We got a table.

26:26.380 --> 26:27.642
Are you?

26:28.680 --> 26:30.648
Uh, yes.

26:32.950 --> 26:34.110
Okay.

26:35.690 --> 26:38.250
I don't want to be
wary of you, Alicia.

26:39.290 --> 26:41.326
I know.

26:41.360 --> 26:43.590
I don't like it.

26:44.370 --> 26:46.895
Feels like we're
av0iding each other.

26:46.930 --> 26:49.694
I know. I liked it
when we were friends.

26:49.740 --> 26:51.833
Me, too.

26:51.870 --> 26:53.929
Then let's do that.

26:55.310 --> 26:56.800
Okay.

27:03.380 --> 27:05.712
Okay. Good night.

27:25.370 --> 27:27.361
*

27:33.480 --> 27:35.448
(elevator bell dings)

27:35.480 --> 27:37.687
(elevator doors open)

27:53.870 --> 27:55.792
Nisa, I didn't know
you were here.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.899
I'm leaving.

27:59.010 --> 28:00.739
Nisa...

28:00.780 --> 28:02.202
is something wrong?
Um, nothing.

28:02.240 --> 28:04.401
I-I'm just, um... Nothing.

28:04.450 --> 28:06.304
Good night, Mrs. Florrick.

28:08.750 --> 28:09.944
Hey, Mom.

28:09.980 --> 28:12.187
Grace, do you know
what's wrong with Nisa?

28:12.220 --> 28:14.381
Oh, yeah. Zach
broke up with her.

28:14.420 --> 28:16.957
He... Wait, I thought
they were doing good.

28:16.990 --> 28:19.754
Yeah, well, the campaign
told Zach to cool it.

28:19.790 --> 28:21.929
The campaign?

28:21.960 --> 28:24.428
Yeah, the whole picture thing.
Okay, Grace,

28:24.470 --> 28:26.927
talk to me as if
I weren't omniscient.

28:26.970 --> 28:29.268
There's a picture
with Zach and Nisa

28:29.300 --> 28:31.131
and it's with
her Muslim parents,

28:31.170 --> 28:33.809
and it looked like
it might hurt Dad.

28:33.840 --> 28:35.899
According to who? Eli?

28:35.940 --> 28:37.840
Mm-mm, Jordan.

28:37.880 --> 28:39.438
He sat down
with Zach,

28:39.480 --> 28:42.142
and then Zach
broke up with Nisa.

28:42.180 --> 28:44.410
(wry laugh)
Why does everyone think

28:44.450 --> 28:47.180
it's all right
to parent my children?

28:51.260 --> 28:52.488
Alicia!

28:52.530 --> 28:53.997
Not now, Eli.

28:55.030 --> 28:56.452
How dare you

28:56.500 --> 28:58.468
counsel my son on
his personal life

28:58.500 --> 28:59.899
without my permission.

28:59.930 --> 29:01.466
Mrs. Florrick, I don't
think that you...

29:01.500 --> 29:04.003
Why don't we talk in here.
No.

29:04.040 --> 29:06.258
If this is about
the Muslim photo,

29:06.310 --> 29:09.507
Zach asked if the photo
was affecting the campaign,
and I told him the truth.

29:09.540 --> 29:11.474
I said that we were
taking a hit, that's it.

29:11.510 --> 29:13.444
I didn't tell him
what to do.
He's 17 years old,

29:13.480 --> 29:16.415
and adores his father-- what
did you think he would do?

29:16.450 --> 29:18.213
Mrs. Florrick,
with all due respect,

29:20.990 --> 29:23.550
a serious problem
for your husband.
That is not

29:23.590 --> 29:24.420
theissue!

29:24.460 --> 29:26.485
You stepped way
over the line.

29:26.530 --> 29:29.920
Don't you ever approach
my son again.

29:29.960 --> 29:31.791
(quietly):
Even

29:33.940 --> 29:35.259
Alicia.

29:35.300 --> 29:38.269
I am so sorry. I warned him
about the family issues,

29:38.310 --> 29:41.131
but I think his other
campaigns ran differently.

29:42.180 --> 29:44.000
Okay, Eli.

29:45.280 --> 29:47.544
I don't know what
the game is here,

29:47.580 --> 29:50.777
but if you're
using me, stop.

29:52.020 --> 29:53.817
Okay?

29:53.860 --> 29:54.918
Okay.

29:59.160 --> 30:01.822
WILL: _ _
Why don't you give it
a rest, Mr. Hobson.

30:01.860 --> 30:03.259
Obfuscation.
You're the one that
brought up suicide.

30:03.300 --> 30:04.995
Wait, wait,
wait...

30:05.030 --> 30:06.099
One at a time.

30:06.130 --> 30:08.860
Mr. Hobson.
Mr. Gardner is
advocating this witness

30:08.900 --> 30:12.006
to push the ridiculous
theory that Justice
Ludwig was murdered.

30:12.040 --> 30:13.530
AML v. Hellman, Mr. Coroner.

30:13.570 --> 30:16.300
The coroner in Hellman
was found biased

30:16.340 --> 30:19.343
because he only entertained
one proposition of a case.

30:19.380 --> 30:21.075
Fairness demands that

30:21.120 --> 30:23.315
a jury not only hear evidence
as to suicide...

30:23.350 --> 30:25.113
There is simply
no foundation...

30:25.150 --> 30:26.947
A moment, Mr. Hobson.

30:29.590 --> 30:31.979
(babeng)

30:32.030 --> 30:34.453
Danny, you can
bring in the jury.

30:34.500 --> 30:36.491
We'll hear from
your Witness,

30:36.530 --> 30:38.498
Mr. Gardner,
Mrs. Florrick.

30:38.530 --> 30:39.599
I better go
prepare her.

30:39.630 --> 30:41.131
Yes, good luck with that.

30:46.010 --> 30:47.875
Oh, God.

30:49.140 --> 30:50.573
I'm sorry.

30:52.480 --> 30:54.243
Janie, I hate
to ask you this, but do you

30:54.280 --> 30:55.542
have any idea who this
blonde woman might be?

30:55.580 --> 30:58.981
What, the one that my
husband was screwing
in a motel room? No!

30:59.020 --> 31:01.352
I'm sorry.

31:01.390 --> 31:02.459
I'm...

31:03.620 --> 31:05.451
(quietly):
I'm sorry.

31:06.630 --> 31:08.427
It's just that
I've-I've lost him

31:08.460 --> 31:10.519
and_ now his love
all in one week.

31:10.560 --> 31:13.393
I don't know
what I have left.

31:14.440 --> 31:17.364
_ (crying):
His debts, I suppose.

31:20.010 --> 31:22.672
Is everything
all right?

31:22.710 --> 31:24.541
Well, your father has

31:24.580 --> 31:27.447
some unfortunate news about the
Emmonds Pharmaceutical account.

31:27.480 --> 31:29.641
JEFFREY:
I was just telling Diane
that I owe your firm

31:29.680 --> 31:30.874
an apology...

31:30.920 --> 31:34.219
but a decision has been made
to go with Jennings/Albright.

31:34.260 --> 31:36.455
You're pulling your business?
Management has

31:36.490 --> 31:39.926
expressed concerns about
Lockhart/Gardner's history

31:39.960 --> 31:42.929
of pursuing big pharma
with class actions.
I have assured Mr. Agos

31:42.960 --> 31:44.291
that our past work
won't impede

31:44.330 --> 31:46.469
our total commitment
in this matter.
Of course not.

31:46.500 --> 31:47.694
There's no conflict here.

31:47.730 --> 31:50.665
That's the very point
I made to the board,
but the CEO thinks

31:50.700 --> 31:52.634
that the optics are wrong.

31:52.670 --> 31:54.638
(sighs):
This is my mistake.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.329
I should've prepared them.

31:56.380 --> 31:59.099
DIANE:
Is there any way for
us to resolve this?

31:59.150 --> 32:00.572
I'm afraid not.

32:00.610 --> 32:02.510
And I'm very sorry.

32:09.190 --> 32:12.182
Diane, this is...
this is a complete surprise.

32:12.230 --> 32:13.993
Yes.

32:14.030 --> 32:15.918
For me, too.

32:18.570 --> 32:20.697
(indistinct talking)

32:20.730 --> 32:21.697
Okay.

32:24.540 --> 32:25.438
Who's she?
No idea.

32:25.470 --> 32:27.267
CLAYPOOL: Ladies_ and
gentlemen of the jury,

32:27.310 --> 32:29.335
as you know, we
are now considering

32:29.380 --> 32:31.644
not only a theory
of accidental death

32:31.680 --> 32:33.705
as well as_ a
theory of SUIClde,

32:33.750 --> 32:37.277
but also a theory,
potentially, of homicide.

32:37.320 --> 32:39.709
Which is why...

32:39.750 --> 32:42.719
Assistant State's Attorney
of Lake County Shirley Mann

32:42.760 --> 32:44.227
has joined us
for the duration.

32:44.260 --> 32:45.352
Thank you, Mr. Claypool.

32:45.390 --> 32:46.652
At this time, if possible,

32:46.690 --> 32:49.124
I'd like to ask a few questions
of Mrs. Ludwig.

32:49.160 --> 32:51.526
Mr. Claypool,
I'm not sure

32:51.570 --> 32:53.367
how my client's testimony
is relevant

32:53.400 --> 32:55.129
in this regard.
I'm not, either.

32:55.170 --> 32:56.694
But the ASA has
an absolute right

32:56.740 --> 32:59.163
to join in these proceedings.

32:59.210 --> 33:01.132
Mrs. Ludwig, please.

33:01.180 --> 33:02.704
Make your answers short
and declarative.

33:02.740 --> 33:04.742
MANN:
Thank you, Mrs. Ludwig.

33:04.780 --> 33:07.146
I am very sorry for your loss,
and I apologize

33:07.180 --> 33:08.738
for having to question you
at this time.

33:08.780 --> 33:11.317
Now, according to the statement
you gave the police,

33:11.350 --> 33:14.581
you were home the night
of March 2, is that correct?

33:14.620 --> 33:16.156
Yes. I hadn't wanted to go

33:16.190 --> 33:18.158
to the dinner
my husband was attending.

33:18.190 --> 33:19.521
I didn't feel well.

33:19.560 --> 33:21.528
MANN:
And you were at home
until you were notified

33:21.560 --> 33:22.720
of your husband's
death at approximately

33:22.760 --> 33:24.421
12:20 a.m.?
Yes.

33:24.470 --> 33:26.461
Now, as Coroner Claypool
has explained,

33:26.500 --> 33:30.459
this is not a courtroom,
but you are still under oath.

33:30.500 --> 33:33.333
Do you wish to stand
by that statement?

33:35.280 --> 33:38.738
Mr. Claypool, I'm advising
my client to invoke her Fifth

33:38.780 --> 33:39.769
Amendment right not to testify.

33:39.810 --> 33:41.710
(gallery murmuring)

33:41.750 --> 33:43.741
_ All... all
right, everyone.

33:44.790 --> 33:48.009
Mrs. Ludwig?

33:49.860 --> 33:52.158
On counsel's advice,

33:52.190 --> 33:55.125
I am invoking my Fifth Amendment
right not to answer.

33:55.160 --> 33:56.696
MANN:
Mrs. Ludwig, this is

33:56.730 --> 33:58.561
an affidavit from your neighbor
stating that he heard you

33:58.600 --> 34:01.831
leave on the night in question,
shortly before 10:00 p.m.,

34:01.870 --> 34:03.394
and that according to him,

34:03.440 --> 34:06.136
you didn't return
until almost midnight.

34:06.170 --> 34:07.808
Mrs. Ludwig, where did you go

34:07.840 --> 34:09.831
between 10:00 pm.
and midnight, March 2?

34:09.880 --> 34:11.347
On counsel's advice,

34:11.380 --> 34:13.177
I am invoking
my Fifth Amendment right

34:13.210 --> 34:15.075
not to answer.

34:19.820 --> 34:22.687
So, you did know
about the affair?

34:22.720 --> 34:23.687
I suspected.

34:23.720 --> 34:25.187
I wasn't sure.

34:25.230 --> 34:26.754
Did you lie to the police
about your whereabouts

34:26.790 --> 34:28.326
at the time
of your husband's death?

34:28.360 --> 34:30.453
Yes.

34:30.500 --> 34:32.627
When he mentioned
the dinner,

34:32.670 --> 34:34.729
I got suspicious.
I thought about

34:34.770 --> 34:36.260
calling Bigelow, but I knew

34:36.300 --> 34:38.439
I wouldn't get a straight answer
out of him.

34:38.470 --> 34:40.358
He and Roger were very close,

34:40.410 --> 34:41.604
and he had covered
for Roger before.

34:41.640 --> 34:45.679
This wasn't the first time your
husband had been unfaithful?

34:45.710 --> 34:47.644
Where did you go that night,
Mrs. Ludwig?

34:47.680 --> 34:48.749
I drove to the
restaurant.

34:48.780 --> 34:50.771
W-When I saw he wasn't there,

34:50.820 --> 34:54.381
I drove around to a couple of
places I thought he might be.

34:54.420 --> 34:55.887
Then I just drove around angry

34:55.920 --> 34:58.320
for a while, and
then, I went home.

34:58.360 --> 35:01.693
Then the phone rang,
and everything changed.

35:01.730 --> 35:03.391
I know I should have told you.

35:03.430 --> 35:05.489
I just didn't think
that it was important,

35:05.530 --> 35:08.260
and I was embarrassed.

35:08.300 --> 35:10.666
Did I just lose this?

35:10.700 --> 35:14.375
It's not about losing
the insurance money anymore.

35:14.410 --> 35:16.435
You're in danger
of being arrested.

35:17.840 --> 35:19.740
Diane.

35:19.780 --> 35:21.213
Good to see you.

35:21.250 --> 35:22.615
Mr. Agos,
I wasn't expecting you.

35:22.650 --> 35:24.686
We received the call
from your general counsel.

35:24.720 --> 35:26.142
Yes, about that.

35:26.190 --> 35:28.215
Now, look, I may have
overstepped a bit

35:28.260 --> 35:31.229
in trying to help out my
son, and if so, mea culpa.

35:31.260 --> 35:33.626
Parents are blind when it
comes to their children.

35:33.660 --> 35:35.525
Indeed.
What I'm saying
is, I think

35:35.560 --> 35:38.222
there may be a way
for us to salvage this.

35:38.270 --> 35:40.420
If we could get a few more
partners on the account

35:40.470 --> 35:42.358
so that our GC
doesn't feel like

35:42.400 --> 35:44.459
we're in the hands_ of a
fourth-year assoaate.

35:44.510 --> 35:45.738
Mm-hmm.
Diane?

35:45.770 --> 35:47.931
I'd like you to
meet Dale Dazzo,

35:47.970 --> 35:49.676
the CEO
of Emmonds Pharmaceuticals.

35:49.710 --> 35:51.200
Well, it's a pleasure.

35:51.250 --> 35:52.774
Cary happened to
catch me at lunch.

35:52.810 --> 35:56.314
He's been telling me
about your firm's lobbying work.

35:56.350 --> 35:58.489
And your connection
to the SA's office.

35:58.520 --> 36:00.408
Very impressive.

36:00.450 --> 36:02.315
There was some nervousness

36:02.360 --> 36:04.521
from one of our VPs,

36:04.560 --> 36:07.529
but I think we'd be fools
to go anywhere else.

36:07.560 --> 36:10.256
I couldn't agree more.

36:10.300 --> 36:11.722
Well, we're happy to hear that.

36:11.770 --> 36:14.489
Dale, Dad, welcome
to Lockhart/Gardner.

36:14.540 --> 36:15.791
Again.

36:15.840 --> 36:18.263
(laughter)

36:18.310 --> 36:19.800
No, I am impressed, Cary.

36:19.840 --> 36:22.809
I mean, that was
a remarkable save.

36:22.840 --> 36:24.444
And you're good
with Dazzo.

36:24.480 --> 36:25.674
That is not easy.

36:25.710 --> 36:26.938
Oh, I don't know.

36:26.980 --> 36:28.811
He said that you're
doing pretty good, too.

36:28.850 --> 36:30.511
Well...

36:30.550 --> 36:32.882
You know, we could always
work together.

36:32.920 --> 36:35.980
Unfortunately, Mr. Dazzo
thought it would be better

36:36.020 --> 36:38.352
ifI worked directly
with the general counsel.

36:38.390 --> 36:39.948
Without any middlemen.

36:39.990 --> 36:42.697
You understand?

36:42.730 --> 36:44.698
He didn't say that.

36:44.730 --> 36:47.221
He did.

36:47.270 --> 36:49.568
You hold a grudge, don't you?

36:49.600 --> 36:51.568
No.

36:51.610 --> 36:53.703
Dad, no, I don't.

36:53.740 --> 36:56.004
I'm too busy to hold grudges.

36:56.040 --> 36:58.247
Take care.

36:58.280 --> 37:00.771
Thanks for
the business.

37:00.810 --> 37:02.778
(elevator bell dings)

37:02.820 --> 37:05.641
KALINDA:
Janie Ludwig said
you and her husband

37:05.690 --> 37:06.748
were good friends.

37:06.790 --> 37:07.848
We were.
(teakettle whistling)

37:07.890 --> 37:10.688
Bethany and I were devastated
when we heard the news.

37:10.720 --> 37:12.028
(whistling stops)

37:12.060 --> 37:14.790
Did he bring anyone
to dinner with him that evening?

37:14.830 --> 37:16.320
No, Janie didn't come.

37:16.360 --> 37:17.850
It was just us catching up.

37:17.900 --> 37:19.993
We meant, anyone

37:20.030 --> 37:22.032
besides Mrs. Ludwig.

37:22.070 --> 37:24.664
No.

37:24.710 --> 37:25.836
No, no, no, no. No.

37:25.870 --> 37:27.735
Janie and Roger had
some rough spots,

37:27.770 --> 37:31.274
but that_ was a...
a long time ago.

37:31.310 --> 37:34.370
There was a colleague he was
seeing about a year ago, but

37:34.420 --> 37:36.445
we sat him down,
and he broke it off.

37:36.480 --> 37:37.879
He's been a faithful man
ever Since.

37:37.920 --> 37:39.683
This colleague a year
ago-- was she blonde?

37:39.720 --> 37:40.948
(door closing)
No. Why?

37:40.990 --> 37:42.514
WOMAN:
Hey, babe.
Everything all right?

37:42.560 --> 37:45.825
Just some, uh, investigators
with the Ludwigs' attorneys.

37:45.860 --> 37:47.657
They had some questions
about Roger.

37:47.690 --> 37:49.692
It's terrible
what happened.

37:49.730 --> 37:51.459
They think Roger might
have been murdered.

37:51.500 --> 37:52.819
Oh, my gosh.

37:52.870 --> 37:54.997
What do you think?

37:56.640 --> 37:58.961
I think that's a very unique
license plate.

38:01.110 --> 38:03.135
What do you
want to do?

38:07.010 --> 38:09.410
(car alarm wailing,
dog barking)

38:12.890 --> 38:14.881
(door closing)

38:18.690 --> 38:20.658
(two beeps,
car alarm stops)

38:20.690 --> 38:22.794
(barking continues)

38:25.130 --> 38:27.098
What?

38:27.130 --> 38:29.598
You were sleeping
with Justice Ludwig,

38:29.640 --> 38:32.006
and you fought with him
the night he was murdered.

38:32.040 --> 38:34.065
Go away.
Okay, well,
if you won't talk with us,

38:34.110 --> 38:35.668
we can always
talk to your husband.

38:35.710 --> 38:38.679
Yes, Roger and I were
seeing each other,

38:38.710 --> 38:41.417
but I had nothing
to do with his death.

38:41.450 --> 38:44.544
We fought at the motel because
I was breaking up with him.

38:44.590 --> 38:46.478
After that,
I drove straight home.

38:46.520 --> 38:47.942
Right, and can anyone
confirm that?

38:47.990 --> 38:49.810
My husband.

38:49.860 --> 38:52.624
But it will destroy my marriage.
Please.

38:53.830 --> 38:55.957
We know _there was
another vehicle involved.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.854
Did you see anyone else
that night?

39:00.000 --> 39:01.991
As I was driving the other way,

39:02.040 --> 39:07.637
I passed an SUV speeding,
swerving.

39:07.670 --> 39:11.743
It was headed in
the same direction as Roger.

39:11.780 --> 39:12.849
And you didn't report it?

39:12.880 --> 39:14.074
I couldn't.

39:14.110 --> 39:16.044
Janie is a friend of mine.

39:24.120 --> 39:25.678
He was driven
off the road?

39:25.730 --> 39:28.085
Yes, by a drunk driver
with .10 blood alcohol.

39:28.130 --> 39:31.691
So, a new, new, new theory.

39:31.730 --> 39:33.493
I move that we skip
the preliminaries

39:33.530 --> 39:35.794
and just get to the man
on the grassy knoll.

39:35.840 --> 39:37.637
Yeah, before we get
to that, Mr. Hobson,

39:37.670 --> 39:39.399
I need to hear this one out.

39:39.440 --> 39:40.668
His name is Landon Boyce.

39:40.710 --> 39:43.099
20 minutes after Justice Ludwig
crashed his car,

39:43.140 --> 39:46.678
Landon Boyce was pulled over
for a DUI on the same road.

39:46.710 --> 39:47.847
HOBSON:
And yet the police haven't

39:47.880 --> 39:49.416
said boo about any of this?

39:49.450 --> 39:51.042
The Lake County Police
never mentioned this DUI

39:51.080 --> 39:52.616
because they didn't
know about it.

39:52.650 --> 39:54.015
The arrest happened two
miles into Cook County.

39:54.050 --> 39:56.689
HOBSON:
The only thing this proves is
that some guy on the same

39:56.720 --> 39:58.017
stretch of highway
got hit with a DUI.

39:58.060 --> 39:59.186
There's nothing
to suggest he drove

39:59.230 --> 40:00.549
the judge off the road.

40:00.590 --> 40:01.818
ALICIA:
Mr. Claypool,
we'd like to submit

40:01.860 --> 40:03.851
the EDR from Mr. Boyce's SUV.

40:03.900 --> 40:04.559
E.D...?

40:04.600 --> 40:05.897
ALICIA:
Event data recorder.

40:05.930 --> 40:07.192
It's like
the little

40:07.230 --> 40:08.458
black box for a car.

40:08.500 --> 40:11.037
11:42 p.m.,
the exact moment

40:11.070 --> 40:13.538
of the judge's
accident, the EDR shows

40:13.570 --> 40:15.936
Mr. Boyce's SUV
swerved and braked hard,

40:15.980 --> 40:19.074
coming to a full stop
before accelerating again.

40:19.110 --> 40:22.773
Justice Ludwig swerved
to avoid being hit and

40:22.820 --> 40:24.481
crashed into
the guardrail.

40:24.520 --> 40:25.714
CLAYPOOL:
Well,

40:25.750 --> 40:31.484
Mr. Hobson, of all the theories
I've heard from both sides,

40:31.530 --> 40:33.623
this is the first one

40:33.660 --> 40:36.595
that's had something
resembling hard evidence.

40:36.630 --> 40:39.463
I'm gonna let
the jury hear it.

40:40.730 --> 40:43.836
I never expected them to settle.

40:43.870 --> 40:46.031
Certainly not
for the full amount.

40:46.070 --> 40:48.209
Wilk Hobson coul_dn't risk it
gomg to a jury.

40:48.240 --> 40:49.969
If they'd ruled
it was an accident,

40:50.010 --> 40:51.898
Wolf & Bland would have had
to pay double.

40:51.950 --> 40:53.099
We're just sorry
about everything

40:53.150 --> 40:54.811
that was laid out
on the table.

40:54.850 --> 40:57.614
There's no need to be sorry
about the truth.

41:00.090 --> 41:02.058
A victory all around.

41:02.090 --> 41:04.058
Yup.

41:04.090 --> 41:06.081
I'll see you at the
Chicago Shamrock Dinner?

41:06.130 --> 41:08.496
Yes.

41:08.530 --> 41:10.589
You do know
it's white tie, right?

41:10.630 --> 41:12.825
What?

41:14.900 --> 41:16.891
What's going on here?

41:16.940 --> 41:18.601
I'm going.

41:18.640 --> 41:20.858
You're going?
Where are you going?

41:20.910 --> 41:24.903
Come on. You set me up,
and I didn't even see it coming.

41:24.950 --> 41:26.906
Nicely played.

41:26.950 --> 41:28.201
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

41:28.250 --> 41:29.569
Peter relieved me.

41:29.620 --> 41:31.019
Got involved
in the family business,

41:31.050 --> 41:33.746
so he asked me
to take a step back.

41:33.790 --> 41:37.783
Gosh. That's terrible.

41:37.820 --> 41:39.754
And all I wanted
to do was help him win, Eli.
Yeah.

41:39.790 --> 41:41.121
That's all you wanted to do.

41:41.160 --> 41:42.752
Some people
aren't like you.

41:42.800 --> 41:44.768
We're too busy dealing
with politics in the field

41:44.800 --> 41:46.199
to want politics in the office.

41:46.230 --> 41:48.698
Hold on, let me write that down.

41:48.740 --> 41:50.696
Good luck, Eli.

41:50.740 --> 41:52.833
You're gonna die a sad
and lonely old man

41:52.870 --> 41:54.098
'cause you don't trust anyone.

41:54.140 --> 41:56.938
The Florrick campaign thanks you
for your contribution. Good-bye.

41:56.980 --> 41:59.005
GRACE:
Wow.

41:59.050 --> 42:00.847
You look like
a princess.

42:00.880 --> 42:04.611
This was marked down 60%,
so, thank you.

42:04.650 --> 42:07.039
Nice, Mom.

42:07.090 --> 42:08.148
Grandma Veronica called.

42:08.190 --> 42:09.851
She said she's stopping by

42:09.890 --> 42:11.926
before she goes
to her St. Patrick's Day party.

42:11.960 --> 42:13.120
Ooh, that should be fun.

42:13.160 --> 42:14.821
You want us
to hide the alcohol?

42:14.860 --> 42:16.259
It's St. Patrick's
Day in Chicago.

42:16.300 --> 42:18.666
Hiding it won't make
a difference.

42:18.700 --> 42:19.826
GRACE:
Have fun tonight.

42:19.870 --> 42:21.121
Love you.
Love you, too.

42:22.870 --> 42:24.565
What happened with Nisa?

42:24.610 --> 42:26.828
Oh, it's okay, Mom.
No.

42:26.870 --> 42:29.805
Zach, the campaign,
these campaigns-- they...

42:33.610 --> 42:36.716
You date whoever you want.

42:36.750 --> 42:38.217
It really is okay, Mom.

42:38.250 --> 42:39.945
I was going to break
up with her anyways.

42:39.990 --> 42:42.208
No, Zach,
the campaign will survive.

42:42.260 --> 42:43.682
Seriously,

42:43.720 --> 42:45.221
H was going
to break up with her.

42:45.260 --> 42:47.353
College is right
around the corner,

42:47.390 --> 42:50.052
and she wanted to
get more serious.

42:50.100 --> 42:52.728
Go to your party. I'm fine.

42:52.770 --> 42:55.830
* My devw-eyed Disney bride,
what has tried *

42:55.870 --> 42:58.805
* Singles ads

42:58.840 --> 43:01.900
* They run you hot and cold
like a rheostat *

43:01.940 --> 43:03.828
* I mean a thermostat

43:03.880 --> 43:05.848
* So you bite on a towel

43:05.880 --> 43:09.919
* Hope it won't hurt too bad

43:09.950 --> 43:12.145
* And she says, "I like long
walks and sci-fi movies"... *
