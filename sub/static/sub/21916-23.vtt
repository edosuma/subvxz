Previously on Mystery Incorporated...

00:08.424 --> 00:10.025
The Hunters of Secrets.

00:10.093 --> 00:12.360
They were the original
group manipulated

00:12.428 --> 00:13.696
by the evil entity

00:13.763 --> 00:15.464
in hopes they would
set him free

00:15.531 --> 00:16.999
from his crystal sarcophogus.

00:17.067 --> 00:19.334
Instead of setting
the evil one free,

00:19.402 --> 00:21.269
they were about to destroy it

00:21.337 --> 00:24.607
with the heart of the jaguar.

00:24.674 --> 00:27.442
Jinkies! After all
we've been through,

00:27.510 --> 00:31.847
only to find out that we've been
manipulated by some evil entity.

00:31.915 --> 00:33.348
What are we gonna do?

00:33.416 --> 00:37.586
We have to find
the heart of the jaguar.

01:01.544 --> 01:03.646
Hi-hoo.
Angie Dinkley speaking.

01:03.713 --> 01:06.448
Angie!
I mean, senora Dinkley.

01:06.516 --> 01:07.916
It is I, Enrique.

01:07.984 --> 01:09.985
It's Professor Andelusossa.

01:10.053 --> 01:11.386
I have found it.

01:11.454 --> 01:14.556
I have found the temple
of the dark altar.

01:14.624 --> 01:17.292
Has he got it? Does he have
the heart of the jaguar?

01:17.360 --> 01:19.828
All my research indicates
the sacred spirit

01:19.896 --> 01:22.064
is located underneath
this temple.

01:22.132 --> 01:23.966
Ooh. Enrique,
be careful.

01:24.034 --> 01:27.136
Ha ha.
Do not worry, señora.

01:27.203 --> 01:30.005
There is nothing here
but myself and the jungle.

01:30.073 --> 01:32.141
I have nothing to fear.

01:32.208 --> 01:35.544
I only must make sure
this is the right temple.

01:39.248 --> 01:40.615
Huh? Huh?

01:43.286 --> 01:45.520
Enrique, what's going on?

01:45.588 --> 01:47.489
Aah!

01:47.557 --> 01:49.491
Enrique? Enrique!

01:49.559 --> 01:51.827
Aah!

01:53.930 --> 01:55.931
The jungle is consuming me.

01:55.999 --> 02:00.102
Angie, I must tell you now
before I am gone,

02:00.170 --> 02:06.775
I...have always...
loved you.

02:20.623 --> 02:22.290
Oh!

02:22.358 --> 02:24.593
Jinkies!

Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

03:04.209 --> 03:07.479
An ancient evil has been
manipulating us all along.

03:07.547 --> 03:09.714
It controlled our thoughts,
our feelings.

03:09.782 --> 03:11.817
Everything we know
could be a lie...

03:11.884 --> 03:14.352
Mystery Incorporated,
your love of traps,

03:14.420 --> 03:16.354
our entire relationship.

03:16.422 --> 03:17.656
Oh, no, never.

03:17.723 --> 03:19.357
Nothing could ever
fake that feeling.

03:19.425 --> 03:22.727
I really do so sincerely
love traps.

03:22.795 --> 03:25.396
And you.

03:25.465 --> 03:27.398
Our love is real, Daph.

03:27.467 --> 03:29.734
Oh, Freddie!

03:29.802 --> 03:33.237
If some great big evil dude
buried under Crystal Cove

03:33.305 --> 03:37.108
has been controlling us, like,
we have to question everything.

03:37.176 --> 03:38.816
We've been best buds
since you were a pup.

03:38.878 --> 03:42.080
But, like, how do we even
know we're really best buds?

03:42.147 --> 03:44.783
Could not best buds do this?

03:55.995 --> 03:58.229
Like, not in a gazillion years.

03:59.932 --> 04:02.701
How do you know
Professor Andelusossa anyway?

04:02.768 --> 04:05.036
Is there something
I should know?

04:05.104 --> 04:07.305
Oh, no, sweetie.
It was years and years

04:07.373 --> 04:10.308
it was years and years
before I ever met your father.

04:10.376 --> 04:12.577
I was 16, spending
a year aboard,

04:12.645 --> 04:14.679
studying to be
a flamenco dancer.

04:14.747 --> 04:18.149
Enrique was a gardener's apprentice
at one of the big resorts,

04:18.216 --> 04:21.386
but he longed to become
an explorer and antique dealer.

04:21.452 --> 04:23.922
He had been so handsome
and debonair.

04:23.990 --> 04:26.958
He danced on the beach,
dove the coral reefs.

04:27.026 --> 04:28.292
Ooh!

04:28.360 --> 04:30.795
But summer flings,
they don't mean a thing.

04:30.863 --> 04:35.099
But oh, oh, those
summer nights.

04:36.468 --> 04:39.638
They're very warm
in the tropics.

04:39.705 --> 04:43.542
Oy gevalt.
I asked.

04:58.524 --> 05:02.393
Oh, the Yucatan is just
like I remembered it.

05:05.831 --> 05:07.832
Hola. Chiquita bonita.

05:10.069 --> 05:11.036
Muy bonita!

05:11.103 --> 05:12.336
Beautiful girl,

05:12.404 --> 05:14.338
please, take these flowers.

05:14.406 --> 05:15.674
Oh, thank you.

05:15.741 --> 05:18.376
Oh, no, no.
For you, señorita.

05:18.444 --> 05:20.912
Uh, thanks?

05:23.115 --> 05:24.583
Targets identified.

05:24.650 --> 05:26.517
They won't get away,
you can count on it.

05:26.586 --> 05:29.187
Operation nightmare is go.

05:31.624 --> 05:35.060
This is Enrique's
antique store.

05:36.528 --> 05:39.397
Oh, my!

05:42.001 --> 05:45.003
Like, I think someone's
been looking for something.

05:45.071 --> 05:49.074
Or this Mr. Andelusossa
is a seriously sloppy hoarder.

05:49.141 --> 05:50.742
Whatever attacked Enrique

05:50.810 --> 05:52.510
must have been here, too.

05:52.578 --> 05:55.213
Like, velma, why is
there a picture of you

05:55.280 --> 05:57.448
taken years before
you were born?

06:03.555 --> 06:05.023
Mom, it's you.

06:05.091 --> 06:07.358
That explains the flowers.

06:07.426 --> 06:09.995
Those men remembered you
from all those years ago.

06:10.062 --> 06:12.697
A pretty girls leaves quite
an impression in the Yucatan.

06:12.765 --> 06:13.732
What do you mean pretty?

06:13.799 --> 06:15.634
You look just like me.

06:15.701 --> 06:18.103
Yes, you were lucky
not to get your father's looks.

06:18.170 --> 06:20.538
Besides, true beauty
is on the inside.

06:20.606 --> 06:22.774
Just like cream filling.

06:22.842 --> 06:24.709
I can taste the true beauty.

06:26.478 --> 06:29.347
Terrible.
Terrible monster!

06:29.414 --> 06:31.016
Huh?

06:31.083 --> 06:34.719
Hi, there. We're looking
for Professor Andelusossa.

06:34.787 --> 06:37.122
Why don't you ask her?

06:37.189 --> 06:40.692
Angie Dinkley, the temptress
who has stolen my Enrique.

06:40.760 --> 06:42.527
Ugh.

06:44.664 --> 06:47.866
With one phone call, she sends
him out into the jungle

06:47.933 --> 06:49.134
like ,

06:49.201 --> 06:51.102
looking for some silly spear.

06:51.170 --> 06:53.404
That silly spear is
the heart of the jaguar.

06:53.472 --> 06:55.473
It's the only thing
that can save the world

06:55.541 --> 06:56.941
from total and utter evil.

06:57.009 --> 06:58.677
And save my girlfriend, too.

06:58.744 --> 07:00.979
That's why we need
to find your husband.

07:01.047 --> 07:03.148
You leave my husband alone,

07:03.215 --> 07:04.816
or you will pay dearly.

07:04.884 --> 07:06.250
All of you!

07:06.318 --> 07:09.821
Well, I guess
we should be going.

07:22.134 --> 07:24.302
Ok, gang, start looking.

07:24.369 --> 07:25.837
What are we looking
for, exactly?

07:25.905 --> 07:27.238
Clue-shaped things.

07:27.306 --> 07:28.673
Like, there's
a million of them.

07:28.741 --> 07:32.276
It's a regular
clue disco in here.

07:32.344 --> 07:33.344
I found something.

07:33.412 --> 07:36.614
What is it?

07:36.682 --> 07:37.782
Never mind.

07:37.850 --> 07:39.617
It's nothing.

07:39.685 --> 07:40.819
Move along, move along.

07:45.191 --> 07:49.094
Look, there must have
been a map here.

07:49.161 --> 07:52.563
But, sweetie, how are we
going to find out where it led?

07:57.436 --> 07:59.704
See, here's where we are now.

07:59.772 --> 08:02.874
Professor's research
led him along the Apacu River.

08:02.942 --> 08:06.377
The last flag is
precisely here.

08:07.346 --> 08:09.280
That's where
the temple must be.

08:09.348 --> 08:11.116
Way to catch up, mom.

08:11.183 --> 08:13.151
All we have to do now
is go to the temple,

08:13.219 --> 08:15.353
find Enrique, and get
the ancient spear.

08:15.420 --> 08:18.656
Trust us, it's
never that simple.

08:18.724 --> 08:20.125
Huh?

08:21.927 --> 08:24.395
Like, see what we mean?

08:29.468 --> 08:31.636
Aah!

08:32.703 --> 08:34.873
Uhh! Aah!

08:34.940 --> 08:36.207
Shaggy!

08:36.275 --> 08:38.609
Huh?

08:57.702 --> 08:59.337
We've got to get free.

08:59.405 --> 09:01.572
Like, hurry, or I'll be
saving a lot of money

09:01.640 --> 09:03.074
on shoes and gloves.

09:03.142 --> 09:05.109
Scooby, throw me that sword!

09:11.150 --> 09:13.651
Whoa-oh-oh!

09:42.247 --> 09:44.115
Hear my curse...

09:44.183 --> 09:47.385
do not enter the jungle
or you will all be doomed!

09:47.453 --> 09:49.687
Especially you!

09:49.754 --> 09:51.189
Who, me?!

09:51.256 --> 09:52.756
No, her!

09:52.824 --> 09:55.159
Oh, thank goodness!

09:58.497 --> 10:00.831
Well, I think we know
what brought the Professor.

10:00.899 --> 10:02.933
Yeah, and what's waiting
for us at that temple.

10:03.002 --> 10:04.735
T-t-t-temple?!

10:04.803 --> 10:06.904
Did you hear what that
scary priestess just said

10:06.972 --> 10:09.307
about being doomed
if we go in the jungle?!

10:09.375 --> 10:11.842
Yeah! And she seemed to know
what she was talking about.

10:11.910 --> 10:14.145
Guys, we're
Mystery Incorporated!

10:14.213 --> 10:16.647
Intimidating tactics
don't work on us.

10:16.715 --> 10:19.583
Oh, yes, they do!

10:19.651 --> 10:22.786
Hmm. Interesting.

10:22.854 --> 10:25.789
Fred, honey, would you mind
bringing these canisters along?

10:25.857 --> 10:27.525
I think they may come in handy.

10:27.592 --> 10:30.194
Sure thing, Mrs. Velma's mom.

10:35.700 --> 10:37.335
This is the life.

10:37.403 --> 10:39.070
Deep in the jungle,
the promise of adventure,

10:39.138 --> 10:41.072
the river rushing by.

10:41.140 --> 10:44.808
They bite me, I bite 'em back.

10:44.876 --> 10:47.245
Whoo.

10:49.981 --> 10:52.517
We're getting close.
Just keep following the river.

10:52.584 --> 10:54.419
What's that?

10:55.354 --> 10:58.356
That's Enrique's boat!

10:58.424 --> 11:01.659
Mom, how could you
possibly know that?

11:01.726 --> 11:05.629
Well, it is called "The Angie".

11:05.697 --> 11:07.998
The priestess must have
attacked Professor Andelusossa

11:08.067 --> 11:11.635
on the river
and caused him to crash.

11:11.703 --> 11:14.939
There's something strange
about these vines.

11:18.009 --> 11:21.212
Abandon ship!

11:21.280 --> 11:22.746
Oh!

11:26.118 --> 11:28.852
Darn! Oh, well! I guess
we'll just have to go back!

11:28.920 --> 11:32.957
No, we're going forward.
On foot! This way.

11:38.063 --> 11:40.131
Targets moving through
jungle on foot.

11:40.199 --> 11:43.334
Operation nightmare continues.

11:45.537 --> 11:48.706
Local legend has it that this
tomb is the burial place

11:48.773 --> 11:50.908
of the Hunters of Secrets.

11:50.976 --> 11:53.344
The heart of the jaguar
should be buried here with them.

11:53.412 --> 11:57.281
Raggy, this looks just like
the temple from our dream.

11:57.349 --> 12:00.851
Like, don't remind me,
Scoob! Ooh-hoo!

12:00.919 --> 12:02.820
According to these hieroglyphs,

12:02.887 --> 12:05.156
which fortunately I can read
because I took a course

12:05.224 --> 12:08.326
in long dead languages at the
Crystal Cove learning annex,

12:08.393 --> 12:11.929
this reads...
"You must face your fears

12:11.997 --> 12:14.499
to enter here."

12:14.566 --> 12:17.535
Face. Hmm.

12:29.248 --> 12:31.915
Hold up, Mrs. Velma's mom.

12:31.983 --> 12:35.419
If I've learned anything from Dr. Rick
Spartan's Online Adventure University,

12:35.487 --> 12:37.388
it's that ancient burial tombs

12:37.456 --> 12:39.923
are filled
with diabolical traps!

12:41.293 --> 12:43.461
Ooh! Oh, like, lucky us!

12:43.529 --> 12:45.129
You said it, Shaggy.

12:45.197 --> 12:46.897
This is going to be
the best ever.

12:46.965 --> 12:49.534
Oh, Freddie, you're so
strong and self-assured.

12:49.601 --> 12:52.170
That's so hot!

13:15.827 --> 13:18.563
The heart of the jaguar.

13:18.630 --> 13:22.132
This must be the right place.

13:29.474 --> 13:31.975
Hmm. If I'm not mistaken,

13:32.043 --> 13:33.977
this is an arc rights
hidden net trap,

13:34.045 --> 13:37.548
with patented
pressure plate trigger.

13:39.651 --> 13:42.152
Thanks, Fred.

13:57.336 --> 14:00.404
A light-activated number three
blow dart device.

14:00.472 --> 14:05.008
Hmm, it's old school,
but...whoo, effective.

14:19.391 --> 14:22.727
Side-crushing
compound trap, nice!

14:34.573 --> 14:37.642
Hmm? Whoa!

14:37.709 --> 14:39.176
Breath-sensitive
spinning blades?

14:39.244 --> 14:44.282
Textbook! All right, gang,
hold your breath.

15:04.569 --> 15:06.203
Stop, stop!

15:06.271 --> 15:09.607
My shoe's untied.

15:44.269 --> 15:46.653
The heart of the jaguar.

15:52.617 --> 15:54.952
Ehh.

15:55.019 --> 15:56.387
Hmm.

15:56.455 --> 15:58.956
Hmm. I give it the Fred Jones

15:59.023 --> 16:01.258
certified trap-free guarantee.

16:01.326 --> 16:04.695
Like, go on, Scooby Doo.
It's all yours, buddy!

16:10.535 --> 16:12.737
Uh-oh!

16:15.974 --> 16:17.742
No way was that spear trapped!

16:17.809 --> 16:19.910
Everyone makes mistakes
now and then, Freddie!

16:19.978 --> 16:21.311
Whoa!

16:25.751 --> 16:27.551
Yes! That is great news.

16:27.619 --> 16:30.688
I knew that spirit
wasn't trapped.

16:41.387 --> 16:44.389
It's the priestess come
to grind our bones into powder!

16:44.456 --> 16:47.025
How dare you come
to this hallowed place

16:47.093 --> 16:49.427
and disrupt the sacred spear!

16:49.495 --> 16:51.596
We...we only wanted
to borrow it.

16:51.664 --> 16:54.232
Like, we promise that
we're going to put it back.

16:54.300 --> 16:56.734
As soon as we destroy
an ancient evil entity with it!

16:56.803 --> 16:59.004
You came only for the spear?!

16:59.071 --> 17:03.341
Do not you wish to find out where we
came upon Professor Andelusossa?!

17:03.409 --> 17:05.277
I totally
forgot about that guy.

17:05.344 --> 17:07.078
Then you will perish!

17:07.146 --> 17:08.880
- Especially you!
- Whoa!

17:08.948 --> 17:10.248
Mom!

17:10.316 --> 17:13.685
D-dear, get the canisters!

17:13.752 --> 17:15.420
10-4, Velma's mom.

17:15.487 --> 17:17.088
Yahh!

17:22.028 --> 17:23.261
What is that stuff?

17:23.329 --> 17:25.896
Ch3co2.

17:25.964 --> 17:28.266
He means ch3, co2.

17:28.334 --> 17:29.634
Vinegar?

17:29.702 --> 17:31.169
I've been using it for years
in my garden.

17:31.237 --> 17:33.671
Best organic weed killer
I've found.

17:35.308 --> 17:36.808
Mmm!

17:36.876 --> 17:39.644
Pickled vine monster, delicious!

17:46.118 --> 17:47.853
Like, Scoob, grab the spear

17:47.920 --> 17:50.956
and let's skedoodle
mucho pronto!

18:20.219 --> 18:21.853
Ahh!

18:21.921 --> 18:24.256
She's coming!

18:26.225 --> 18:28.360
Whoa! Ah!

18:43.910 --> 18:45.777
It's time to see
who this ancient

18:45.844 --> 18:48.646
jade mask wearing weirdo
really is.

18:48.714 --> 18:51.016
Professor Andelusossa?!

18:51.083 --> 18:52.517
Enrique!

18:52.584 --> 18:54.953
It was staring us
in the face all along.

18:55.021 --> 18:57.155
When the men in the village
thought I was my mom,

18:57.223 --> 19:00.625
it was clear that no one was able
to forget her over all these years.

19:00.692 --> 19:02.193
Then there were the vines.

19:02.261 --> 19:04.129
This plant isn't native
to the Yucatan.

19:04.196 --> 19:05.797
Only someone with a background
in gardening

19:05.864 --> 19:08.466
could have cultivated it
and made it grow so quickly.

19:08.534 --> 19:12.037
Professor Andelusossa's
first job was as a gardener.

19:12.104 --> 19:15.540
Finally, the vines on the boat
had been tied to the wheel.

19:15.607 --> 19:17.375
The boat had been scuttled
to make it look like

19:17.443 --> 19:19.510
the Professor had been attacked.

19:19.578 --> 19:21.379
But why, Enrique?

19:21.447 --> 19:23.415
For love. Angie,

19:23.482 --> 19:25.716
when you left me that summer
decades ago,

19:25.784 --> 19:27.518
you took my heart with you.

19:27.586 --> 19:30.555
Every night seems like
I dreamed of you.

19:30.622 --> 19:33.224
When you called asking
about the heart of the jaguar,

19:33.292 --> 19:35.393
I knew it was my only chance
to lure you back...

19:35.461 --> 19:38.363
and find out if you still
cared for me.

19:38.431 --> 19:40.731
So you decided to test her love

19:40.799 --> 19:44.169
by crushing her
with fast-growing killer plants!

19:44.236 --> 19:46.704
Wow. That's exactly
what I would have done.

19:46.772 --> 19:49.107
Oh, Freddie.
That's so romantic.

19:49.175 --> 19:52.177
In your usual,
unique kind of way.

19:52.244 --> 19:53.964
And I would have
gotten away with it, too,

19:54.013 --> 19:56.181
if...

19:56.248 --> 19:58.850
If you had really loved me.

19:58.917 --> 20:02.553
Oh, Enrique, sweetie,
that was all years ago.

20:02.621 --> 20:04.422
There's only one man
I ever truly loved,

20:04.490 --> 20:08.193
and that's my husband,
Mr. Dinkley.

20:08.260 --> 20:10.028
Enrique, you are not a man!

20:10.096 --> 20:12.897
You're a fool!

20:12.965 --> 20:14.466
Daw! Ugh!

20:14.533 --> 20:17.435
Mrs. Dinkley, you have won.
You can have him!

20:17.503 --> 20:19.371
- But I don't want him.
- Then I'll take him!

20:19.438 --> 20:21.239
Huh?!

20:21.307 --> 20:23.441
- Who are you?
- Tomita Kaczynski.

20:23.509 --> 20:25.310
Call sign: Ice princess.

20:25.378 --> 20:28.046
I've been tracking you ever
since you left Crystal Cove.

20:28.114 --> 20:30.882
- Like, why?
- Because I asked her to.

20:30.949 --> 20:33.084
- Huh?!
- Huh?!

20:33.152 --> 20:34.919
Ranger Meadows?!

20:34.987 --> 20:36.954
Lieutenant Kaczynski
is an old friend of mine

20:37.023 --> 20:40.291
from fighter weapons school.

20:40.359 --> 20:41.826
But why are you following us?

20:41.894 --> 20:43.995
Well, it's
kind of embarrassing,

20:44.063 --> 20:45.963
but three days ago,
I had a nightmare

20:46.032 --> 20:47.732
that told me you were in trouble

20:47.799 --> 20:49.300
and that I had to come
to the Yucatan

20:49.368 --> 20:51.736
to help you get
some spear thingie.

20:51.803 --> 20:53.271
The heart of the jaguar.

20:53.339 --> 20:55.740
Yeah, that! I'm supposed
to help you get it

20:55.807 --> 20:58.343
back over the border
and home to Crystal Cover.

20:58.411 --> 21:00.778
Ok, that's it. I give up.

21:00.846 --> 21:02.613
Grab your prisoner
and let's haul.

21:02.681 --> 21:06.317
I got a c130 waiting in an air
strip 30 clicks from here.

21:08.854 --> 21:11.156
Well, gang, let's go home.

21:11.223 --> 21:14.325
We have an evil entity
to destroy.

21:19.031 --> 21:21.699
Dear, is something wrong?

21:21.767 --> 21:24.069
Well, it's just that,

21:24.136 --> 21:25.697
everything that's been
happening lately,

21:25.704 --> 21:27.939
I've always thought
I could count on logic;

21:28.006 --> 21:29.774
deductive reasoning, facts.

21:29.841 --> 21:32.143
But all that's gone.
I never believed

21:32.211 --> 21:33.644
in the supernatural
like you did, and...

21:33.712 --> 21:35.646
Oh, sweetie,
you were never wrong.

21:35.714 --> 21:36.814
Believe in yourself.

21:36.882 --> 21:39.917
Everything
will work out just fine.

21:47.659 --> 21:49.627
Now, come on.
I've been wearing

21:49.695 --> 21:51.796
the same girdle for five days
in the jungle,

21:51.863 --> 21:55.266
and I really need to get
a change of clothes.
