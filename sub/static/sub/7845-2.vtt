01:01.105 --> 01:03.273
I've missed you, too, darling.

01:03.941 --> 01:06.943

Why did you leave me for...

Mm, still stings, doesn't it,<i> hero?</i>

01:11.482 --> 01:13.650

Sir Galavant? An honor. [Chuckles]

07:01.476 --> 07:03.443
I'll just need 100 shillings

07:15.456 --> 07:16.823
Nice beard.

07:16.824 --> 07:18.525
I'm talking about her, of course,

07:18.526 --> 07:20.393
but the facial hair is nice, as well.

07:22.396 --> 07:23.897
Oh, yes. That would have been a hoot.

07:23.898 --> 07:26.333
But, unfortunately,
we don't have the 100 shillings.

Madalena see'd-ya-later, huh, Gal?

scrape together an entry fee?

07:33.107 --> 07:35.342
W-we got more than a pesky entry fee.

07:35.343 --> 07:38.678

Jewel of Valencia as collateral.

07:38.679 --> 07:39.913
Absolutely not!

07:39.914 --> 07:42.082
The Jewel of Valencia is not collateral.

07:42.083 --> 07:44.985
It is the cornerstone of My Kingdom.
Wars have been waged over it.

07:44.986 --> 07:47.854
So I'll put it in the same
ballpark as the rooster, then?

- Yeah. I think that sounds... yeah.
- Yeah?

07:49.256 --> 07:51.491
Sir Galavant will fight the first match.

07:54.962 --> 07:56.296
I can tell you want to bail.

07:56.297 --> 07:58.544
I'll give you five seconds to bail.

I don't want to bail.

they're getting really old.

08:12.112 --> 08:13.613
Hmm, so is your mama.

08:13.614 --> 08:15.648
Seriously, Jean.
It's getting really worn out.

08:15.649 --> 08:16.950

- Don't.

Well, hello, there!

08:30.564 --> 08:33.066
Does this strap
go on the front or the back?

08:33.067 --> 08:34.833
I have no idea.
I haven't worn these in years.

08:34.835 --> 08:35.902
It goes like...

08:35.903 --> 08:37.669
Ow! Hold on.

08:39.653 --> 08:41.573
Yeah, um, feel the need to check in,

08:41.575 --> 08:44.744
'cause, remember, everyone I
love dies if we lose that jewel,

08:44.745 --> 08:47.380
so you definitely got this, right?

08:47.381 --> 08:50.349
Yes. I've got this.

08:50.350 --> 08:52.919
Oh, good God. Do I have to do everything?

08:52.920 --> 08:54.320
[Sighs]

of our entire kingdom.

08:57.091 --> 08:58.524
[Armor clattering]

08:58.525 --> 09:01.627
He will not participate in
a joust like some common knight.

This is a man who slays dragons.

09:04.465 --> 09:05.898
He is the lord of the...

09:05.899 --> 09:08.868
- Sword.
- Lo... no, sorry. I can't.

09:08.869 --> 09:10.336
Fair enough.

09:10.337 --> 09:12.872
Sir Galavant, we will advance
you to the final on merit.

09:12.873 --> 09:14.874

in no condition to do that. Do you agree?
