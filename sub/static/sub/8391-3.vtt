CAN YOU GO GET IT FOR ME?

15:31.300 --> 15:32.858
- MAX, YOU CAN GO UP AND
GET IT YOURSELF.

15:32.890 --> 15:33.993
- CAN I EARN AN EXTRA STICKER?

15:34.030 --> 15:37.682
- CAN YOU LOOK AT ME
WHEN YOU ASK THAT?

15:37.720 --> 15:39.893
- CAN I EARN
AN EXTRA STICKER?

15:39.930 --> 15:42.490
- YES, YOU CAN.

15:48.010 --> 15:49.216

15:49.250 --> 15:51.354

15:51.390 --> 15:53.039

A QUESTION.

15:53.090 --> 15:56.253
- OKAY.
- [exhales]

15:59.300 --> 16:02.337
MAX SHOWS
ABSOLUTELY NO INTEREST

16:02.370 --> 16:03.985
IN ANYTHING I HAVE TO SAY.
NONE.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.954
- WHAT'S THE QUESTION?

16:09.000 --> 16:11.207
- WELL, SHOULDN'T WE
BE TRYING TO WORK ON THAT?

16:11.240 --> 16:13.993
- HE'S MAKING REALLY
GOOD PROGRESS EVERY DAY.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.201
- YEAH.
- SO...

16:16.250 --> 16:19.139
- WELL, I'D LIKE TO SEE HIM
PROGRESSING TOWARDS TALKING,

16:19.180 --> 16:20.795
TOWARDS HAVING
A CONVERSATION.

16:20.840 --> 16:23.240
I CAME HOME LAST NIGHT,

16:23.290 --> 16:26.942
AND HE WAS UP IN BED,
AND I SAT DOWN WITH HIM.

16:26.980 --> 16:28.561
I ASKED HIM QUESTIONS
ABOUT HIS DAY,

16:28.600 --> 16:30.841
I ASKED HIM...
[sighs]

16:30.880 --> 16:33.701
YOU KNOW,
IT'S JUST HARD.

16:33.750 --> 16:38.153
AND I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE
A CONVERSATION WITH MY SON.

16:38.200 --> 16:39.599
- HE'LL GET THERE.

16:39.650 --> 16:43.404
- LISTEN, GABY, IT JUST
SEEMS LIKE LISTENING AND TALKING

16:43.450 --> 16:46.271
IS A PRETTY BASIC SKILL
HE NEEDS TO PRACTICE.

16:46.310 --> 16:47.925
- AND SOCIAL CONNECTION
IS THE MAIN THING

16:47.970 --> 16:49.414
THAT WE'RE WORKING ON.
- MM-HMM.

16:49.450 --> 16:52.578
- AND IT MIGHT TAKE
A WHILE FOR HIM

16:52.630 --> 16:55.906
TO BE ABLE TO APPLY WHAT HE'S
LEARNING IN HIS EVERYDAY LIFE.

16:55.940 --> 16:57.350
- I KNOW THAT.
- OKAY.

16:57.390 --> 17:01.042
- IT'S JUST...
TAKEN A LOT LONGER

17:01.080 --> 17:03.355
THAN I IMAGINED IT WOULD.

17:04.880 --> 17:07.257
- HE'S DOING REALLY WELL.

17:07.300 --> 17:09.700
HE IS.

17:09.750 --> 17:12.981
- OKAY.

17:13.030 --> 17:15.851
[sighs]
THANKS.

17:15.890 --> 17:18.370
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

17:18.410 --> 17:21.061

EVER BECOME A BIG PROBLEM,

17:21.100 --> 17:23.307
BUT, YOU KNOW,

17:23.350 --> 17:24.863

ON MAX'S SOCIAL SKILLS.

22:44.940 --> 22:47.329
- OKAY, HONEY.
THAT'S ALL SHE DOES.

22:47.360 --> 22:48.873

SHE'S HELPING HIM MAINTAIN
EYE CONTACT, YOU KNOW,

22:54.260 --> 22:56.774

- YEAH, I KNOW, BUT--
- WHERE IS THIS COMING FROM?

22:58.270 --> 22:59.498

22:59.550 --> 23:00.676
AND IT'S BEEN MONTHS,
AND A LOT OF MONEY.

23:00.720 --> 23:01.880
- THERE'S A TON,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT--

23:01.930 --> 23:03.579

23:07.240 --> 23:08.923
ARE YOU UPSET?

23:08.970 --> 23:11.029
BECAUSE HE BLEW YOU

23:11.070 --> 23:13.379
IS THAT WHAT THIS IS--
- THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

23:13.420 --> 23:15.001
- OKAY, THAT'S NOT
WHAT IT'S ABOUT, OKAY.

23:18.460 --> 23:19.768
I KNOW YOUR FEELINGS
WERE HURT.

23:19.810 --> 23:20.595
- ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

23:20.640 --> 23:22.904
- IT'S EXACTLY WHAT
IT'S ABOUT.

23:22.950 --> 23:25.225
OKAY?

23:25.260 --> 23:27.603
- I'M HIS FATHER. I WOULD LIKE
HIM TO BE INTERESTED IN ME.

23:27.640 --> 23:30.268
AND IF NOT, I WOULD LIKE HIM
TO BE TRAINED TO BE.

23:30.300 --> 23:31.642
THAT DIDN'T COME OUT RIGHT.

23:31.680 --> 23:33.363
- HONEY, "TRAINED TO BE,"
HE'S NOT A MONKEY.

23:33.410 --> 23:35.059
- I DON'T FEEL LIKE
SHE'S DOING THE WORK--

23:35.100 --> 23:37.091
- OKAY, I UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT
YOU'RE MAKING THIS ABOUT YOU.

23:37.130 --> 23:39.132
- WELL, WHAT'S WRONG WITH
MAKING IT ABOUT ME A LITTLE BIT?

23:39.170 --> 23:41.092
I'M HIS FATHER. I WOULD LIKE
HIM TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN ME.

23:41.140 --> 23:43.552
- I GET IT.
I WANNA CONNECT WITH HIM TOO.

23:43.590 --> 23:45.649
OKAY?
BUT IT'S NOT EASY.

23:45.700 --> 23:48.316
DON'T YOU THINK IT KILLS ME
WHEN I ASK HIM A QUESTION

23:48.350 --> 23:50.102
AND HE DOESN'T RESPOND?

23:50.150 --> 23:53.278
OR HE FLICKS MY HAND AWAY?
IT'S HURTFUL, I UNDERSTAND THAT.

23:53.320 --> 23:56.187
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
FROM NOW ON, ONCE A WEEK,

23:56.220 --> 24:00.088
MAX AND I ARE GONNA HAVE DINNER
TOGETHER, JUST THE TWO OF US.

24:00.120 --> 24:01.360
- OH, GREAT.

24:01.400 --> 24:02.560
- THIS IS A GOOD IDEA,
KRISTINA.

24:02.610 --> 24:06.785
- THIS IS TIME FOR US.
- MM-HMM.

24:06.820 --> 24:08.026
KRISTINA, WHAT IS IT?
WHY ARE YOU--

24:08.060 --> 24:09.539
I WOULD LIKE YOU
TO SUPPORT ME IN THIS.

24:09.580 --> 24:11.639
- I'M SUPPORTING YOU,
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU

24:11.690 --> 24:13.544
TO EXPECT TOO MUCH
TOO SOON FROM HIM.

24:13.590 --> 24:15.091
- [sighs]
- OKAY?

24:15.140 --> 24:16.721
- OKAY.

24:16.760 --> 24:19.513
- I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET
YOUR HOPES UP AND BE LET DOWN.

24:19.560 --> 24:22.245
- I GET IT, OKAY.

24:22.280 --> 24:24.692
SO...WE'RE GONNA START
THIS WEEK.

24:24.730 --> 24:27.176
- YOU CAN.
- DINNERS WITH MAX.

24:27.220 --> 24:28.141
- MM-HMM.

24:32.640 --> 24:34.528
- HI, BABY.

24:34.570 --> 24:37.676
THAT TOOK SO MUCH LONGER
THAN BILL THOUGHT IT WOULD.

24:37.710 --> 24:38.881
- I'M SO SORRY.
- THAT'S FINE.

24:38.920 --> 24:40.501
- UGH!

24:40.540 --> 24:42.405
HOW WAS BEDTIME?

24:42.440 --> 24:43.850
SHE ASLEEP ALL RIGHT?
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

24:43.890 --> 24:45.437
I'M GOING INTO WORK
LATE TOMORROW,

24:45.480 --> 24:47.516
I CAN ACTUALLY TAKE HER TO--
- DID YOU TELL YOUR BROTHER

24:47.550 --> 24:49.233
THAT WE'RE TRYING
TO HAVE ANOTHER BABY?

24:49.280 --> 24:52.374
- UH, I DON'T--
YOU KNOW...

24:52.420 --> 24:54.797
THAT MIGHT'VE SLIPPED OUT.

24:54.830 --> 24:57.958
- YEAH, A SLIP LIKE "JOEL AND I
ARE TRYING FOR NUMBER TWO."

24:58.010 --> 25:00.524
- YEAH, HE'S MY OLDER BROTHER
AND I WAS EXCITED,

25:00.560 --> 25:02.425
AND HE'S EXCITED AND--
- I SPECIFICALLY ASKED YOU

25:02.460 --> 25:05.145
NOT TO TALK
TO ANYBODY ABOUT THIS

25:05.190 --> 25:06.839
WITHOUT DISCUSSING IT FIRST.

25:23.930 --> 25:25.204
- NO...

25:25.240 --> 25:27.800
THAT'S
NOT THE POINT, JULIA.

25:27.830 --> 25:29.650
YOUR BROTHER
CONGRATULATED ME ON SOMETHING

25:29.700 --> 25:31.270
THAT WAS BETWEEN US.

25:31.320 --> 25:32.594
CAN YOU UNDERSTAND?

25:32.630 --> 25:33.722
IT REALLY
PUT ME IN A CORNER.

25:33.770 --> 25:35.931
- WAIT, IT'S GONNA PUT
YOU IN A CORN--

25:35.980 --> 25:38.005
THIS IS PUTTING YOU IN
A CORNER TO HAVE A BABY WITH ME?

25:38.050 --> 25:40.086
- NO, IT'S NOT. I KNEW YOU--
DON'T TURN THIS AROUND.

25:40.120 --> 25:41.803
- I'M NOT TURNING IT AROUND.
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID.

25:41.850 --> 25:45.149
- I SPECIFICALLY TOLD YOU
TO KEEP THIS BETWEEN US.

25:45.190 --> 25:47.818
- YEAH, AND YOU ALSO SAID
THAT IT SOUNDED GREAT.

25:47.850 --> 25:49.772
SO I THOUGHT THAT WE
HAD IT WORKED OUT, AND I--

25:49.820 --> 25:53.028
- NO, YOU KNOW WHAT,
YOU WORKED IT OUT FOR YOU.

25:53.060 --> 25:55.096
IF WE HAVE
ANOTHER BABY, JULIA,

25:55.130 --> 25:58.099
IT'S--IT'S MY DAY-TO-DAY LIFE
THAT'S MOST AFFECTED HERE.

25:58.140 --> 26:00.517
YOU GOT NINE MONTHS,
YOU GOT MATERNITY LEAVE,

26:00.550 --> 26:02.654
AND THEN WHAT?
YOU GO BACK TO WORK,

26:02.690 --> 26:05.079
IN A JOB, IN A WORLD
YOU LOVE FULL OF ADULTS.

26:05.110 --> 26:09.171
AND I'M THE ONE LOCKED
IN THE DIAPERS, AND DAYCARE,

26:09.220 --> 26:10.801
AND ALL OF THE LAUNDRY,

26:10.840 --> 26:13.491
AND FREAKING
PRESCHOOL POLITICS.

26:13.530 --> 26:15.350
- OKAY, YOU SAID--
YOU SAID "IF"?

26:15.400 --> 26:17.049
- YES, IF.
- IF?

26:17.090 --> 26:18.773
- IF.
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

26:18.810 --> 26:21.153
DO YOU WANNA POSTPONE--
- ARE YOU LISTENING

26:21.200 --> 26:23.532
TO ANYTHING I'M SAYING?
THIS IS NOT ABOUT THAT, JULIA--

26:23.580 --> 26:25.912
- AND YOU SAID "IF,"
SO DOES THAT MEAN

26:25.960 --> 26:27.507
THAT YOU WANNA POSTPONE,
OR YOU DON'T WANNA HAVE--

26:27.550 --> 26:30.189
- I DON'T KNOW ANYMORE.
I DON'T KNOW!

26:37.450 --> 26:40.624
[door slams]

26:51.810 --> 26:53.084
[door closes]

26:59.580 --> 27:01.741
- HI.
- HI.

27:01.790 --> 27:06.136
- DID YOU GET THE BOOK?
- YEAH, YEAH.

27:06.170 --> 27:07.967
- IT IS THE BEST BOOK
I'VE EVER READ.

27:08.000 --> 27:11.037
IT'S FANTASTIC.
ALL ABOUT THE SPEECH.

27:11.070 --> 27:14.176
- MM-HMM, THAT'S THE TITLE.
- IT'S GONNA HELP YOU OUT A LOT.

27:14.210 --> 27:16.349
- THANKS, THANK YOU.

27:16.390 --> 27:18.972
- IT'S LIKE THE BIBLE.

27:19.010 --> 27:21.251
- CLEAN UNDERWEAR, TOP DRAWER.
- THANKS.

27:21.290 --> 27:22.803
- EVERYTHING'S HIGHLIGHTED, SO--
- OKAY.

27:22.840 --> 27:25.729
- I'LL BE OUT HERE, BABE.

27:30.540 --> 27:31.768
YOU OKAY?

27:34.890 --> 27:35.925
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

27:35.960 --> 27:37.609
SHOULD I TUCK IT?
- MM.

27:37.650 --> 27:39.857
- BE NICE.

27:39.890 --> 27:42.199
- REALLY?
- IT'S...FINE.

27:42.240 --> 27:44.276
- IT'S TOTALLY OKAY.
- OH, GOOD!

27:44.310 --> 27:48.076
'CAUSE I
WANTED TO BE FINE.

27:48.110 --> 27:49.896
- I'M SORRY, I DON'T
KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU.

27:49.940 --> 27:52.625
- WHAT IS--
WHAT COULD MAKE IT BETTER?

27:52.670 --> 27:54.456
- I JUST THINK IT'S--
YOU LOOK LIKE, UM...

27:54.500 --> 27:56.309
- WELL, LIKE WHAT? HELP ME.
- I MEAN, THERE'S NO--

27:56.360 --> 27:59.420
THERE'S NOTHING TO--
GO IN THERE, GET OFF THE DOOR,

27:59.470 --> 28:01.256
RIGHT THERE, WITH THE BEADS.

28:01.300 --> 28:04.053
- OO
HEYl!”

28:04.090 --> 28:05.705
- HEY, THAT'S
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

28:05.750 --> 28:07.126
- LIKE THAT?
- YEAH, THAT'S BETTER.

28:07.160 --> 28:08.263
- OH, COOL.

28:08.300 --> 28:09.779
WILL YOU DO
MY EYELINER LIKE YOU?

28:09.820 --> 28:11.264
- NO.
- WHY?

28:11.310 --> 28:13.369
- BECAUSE WE'RE
NOT GONNA BE MATCHING.

28:13.410 --> 28:16.026
- LET'S HAVE
FUN TONIGHT, PLEASE.
- EXCUSE ME...

28:16.070 --> 28:18.061
- ARE THERE,
LIKE, PASSES, OR TICKETS?

28:18.110 --> 28:19.589
IS THERE A LIST?
ARE WE EVEN...?

28:19.620 --> 28:21.099
- NOBODY KNOWS ABOUT THIS.

28:21.140 --> 28:23.108
YOU CAN'T GET TICKETS.
YOU JUST GO AND YOU SHOW UP.

28:23.140 --> 28:25.244
IT'S GONNA BE FUN.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

28:25.280 --> 28:28.283
I GOT IT. I GOT IT.

28:29.460 --> 28:31.212
OKAY, THAN KS.

28:31.260 --> 28:34.013
- JUST DOESN'T MAKE ME
FEEL ANY BETTER.

28:34.050 --> 28:36.530
- OKAY.
TWO STRIKES, THREE BALLS.

28:36.570 --> 28:38.845
OOH, NICE HEAT.

28:38.880 --> 28:40.507
BRINGING THE THUNDER.

28:42.580 --> 28:45.094
NICE.
LITTLE HIGH, LITTLE HIGH.

28:45.130 --> 28:48.884
THIS IS FIXING UP TO BE
A NO-HITTER.

28:48.930 --> 28:51.649
- WHOA!
- WHOA! GOOD ONE!

28:51.690 --> 28:52.759
- GOOD ONE.

28:52.800 --> 28:54.199
- OKAY, TIME FOR DINNER.

28:54.240 --> 28:56.697
- YOU HEARD THE LADY.
WASH YOUR HANDS.

28:56.730 --> 28:58.721
NO DINNER FOR BOYS
WITH DIRTY HANDS.

28:58.770 --> 29:00.419
- I KNOW!
- DO YOU KNOW?

29:03.290 --> 29:05.736
UM, RENEE,
CAN I SAY SOMETHING?

29:09.400 --> 29:12.915
I FEEL LIKE WHEN I COME OVER
HERE, I'M AUDITIONING FOR YOU.

29:12.950 --> 29:15.396
BUT THE THING IS,
I ALREADY GOT THE GIG.

29:15.440 --> 29:17.886
I'M ACTUALLY HIS DAD.

29:17.920 --> 29:19.956
AND I THINK YOU CAN SEE
HOW MUCH I LOVE HIM,

29:19.990 --> 29:21.161
AND HOW MUCH
I'M HERE AND INVOLVED,

29:21.200 --> 29:23.475
YOU KNOW, ESPECIALLY
WITH JASMINE GONE.

29:23.520 --> 29:27.308
SO I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE
GIVING ME THE COLD SHOULDER.

29:27.350 --> 29:31.002
- CROSBY, I CAN SEE THAT
YOU ARE A LOT OF FUN.

29:31.040 --> 29:34.908
FUN, CHARMING,
HAPPY-GO-LUCKY.

29:34.940 --> 29:38.558
MY HUSBAND WAS TOO.
HE LOVED A GOOD TIME.

29:38.600 --> 29:41.945
BUT HE DIDN'T STICK AROUND
PAST JASMINE'S FOURTH BIRTHDAY.

29:41.980 --> 29:44.289
SO YOU'LL FORGIVE ME
IF I DON'T APPLAUD

29:44.330 --> 29:46.366
WHEN YOU WANNA TAKE JABBAR
TO A BASEBALL GAME.

29:46.400 --> 29:48.049
- WELL, WAIT, HOLD ON.

29:48.090 --> 29:51.025
YOU KNOW, YOU LOVE YOUR CHURCH,
AND YOUR CHURCH ROCKS.

29:51.060 --> 29:54.644
I'M GLAD I GOT TO GO, BUT...

29:54.680 --> 29:57.569
IN MY FAMILY, WE WENT TO
THE BASEBALL GAME EVERY SUNDAY.

29:57.620 --> 29:59.997
AND WE WENT AS A WHOLE GROUP,
AND WE SAT IN THE BLEACHERS,

30:00.030 --> 30:02.681
AND WE CHEERED TOGETHER, AND
MY DAD NARRATED THE WHOLE THING.

30:02.730 --> 30:04.823
AND IT WAS,
YOU KNOW, SPECIAL.

30:04.870 --> 30:06.758
IT WAS OUR RITUAL.

30:06.800 --> 30:08.768
- SO BASEBALL IS YOUR CHURCH,

30:08.800 --> 30:10.620
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL ME?

30:10.670 --> 30:11.978
- YEAH.

30:12.010 --> 30:13.978
- THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

30:14.010 --> 30:15.659
- OH, HOLD ON,
HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

30:15.710 --> 30:18.178
THAT'S NOT RIDICULOUS, OKAY?

30:18.230 --> 30:21.495
AND I WANT MY SON, JABBAR,
TO HAVE THAT SAME EXPERIENCE

30:21.540 --> 30:23.770
WITH ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE,
AND THE CAMARADERIE.

30:23.820 --> 30:26.880
SO I DISAGREE.

30:26.920 --> 30:28.888
AND ANOTHER THING,
IT'S NOT FAIR OF YOU

30:28.930 --> 30:30.158
TO HOLD
SOME GRUDGE AGAINST ME

30:30.200 --> 30:32.168
FOR SOME CRAP
YOUR HUSBAND DID YEARS AGO.

30:33.590 --> 30:36.309
I'M--I'M HERE FOR MY SON.

30:36.350 --> 30:38.443
OKAY, AND I'M
NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

30:38.490 --> 30:41.004
YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT.

30:47.670 --> 30:50.138
- WELL, THIS IS REALLY FUN,
I'M STANDING IN A PUDDLE.

30:50.190 --> 30:52.112
SUEDE SHOES
IN WATER PUDDLES.

30:52.160 --> 30:53.775
BUT YOU KNOW,
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

30:53.810 --> 30:55.254
I MEAN, I THOUGHT THIS
WAS A SECRET SHOW.

30:55.300 --> 30:57.222
SOMEONE TOLD ME THAT
THIS WAS A SECRET SHOW.

30:57.260 --> 30:58.704
- WELL, JUST IMAGINE
HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD BE HERE

30:58.750 --> 31:00.229
IF IT WAS NOT A SECRET SHOW.

31:00.270 --> 31:01.407
- I REALLY CAN'T IMAGINE
IT WOULD BE MORE THAN THIS.

31:01.440 --> 31:03.123
THIS LOOKS LIKE
EVERYONE IN BERKELEY.

31:03.170 --> 31:06.401
- WELL, LET'S NOT--LET'S NOT
GET ALL WORRIED, YOU KNOW.

31:06.450 --> 31:08.998
THEY HAVEN'T STARTED
LETTING PEOPLE IN, OR WHATEVER.

31:09.030 --> 31:10.611
- JUST TWO?
- OH, WE'RE THREE.

31:10.660 --> 31:12.139
BUT WE'RE--IS THAT--

31:12.180 --> 31:14.512
OH, NO, NO, WE'RE ON THAT.
WE CAN BE TWO.

31:14.560 --> 31:16.073
NO, WE'RE TWO.
- REALLY?

31:16.110 --> 31:17.486
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
- WAS THAT A JOKE?

31:17.530 --> 31:20.283
THAT'S DISGUSTING.
HI, HAVE A GREAT TIME, LADIES.

31:20.320 --> 31:23.005
- THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.
I THINK WE SHOULD GO.

31:23.050 --> 31:25.257
- NO, NO, NO!
- IT'S BEN HARPER, COME ON.

31:25.290 --> 31:27.326
- DUDE, WE'RE NEVER GONNA
GET IN, THIS IS LIKE A JOKE.

31:27.360 --> 31:29.180
- I'M GONNA TALK TO THE GUY.
OKAY, GIVE ME...

31:29.230 --> 31:30.083
WATCH THIS.
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT.

31:30.120 --> 31:31.678
- OKAY, DON'T DO ANYTHING
DISGUSTING.

31:31.710 --> 31:34.156
- DON'T YOU WORRY.
OKAY.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.332
OH, HI, I JUST WANTED
TO CHECK.

31:42.380 --> 31:43.472
OUR NAMES ARE ON THE LIST,
'CAUSE I'M WITH

31:43.520 --> 31:45.272
SOME REALLY IMPORTANT PEOPLE.
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

31:45.310 --> 31:49.383
- BRAVERMAN, I'M WITH
SOME BIG MUSIC INDUSTRY--

31:49.420 --> 31:50.933
- I DON'T HAVE A BRAVERMAN.
- WHAT?

31:50.970 --> 31:52.380
- DON'T HAVE A BRAVERMAN.
- ARE YOU SURE?

31:52.420 --> 31:54.001
- POSITIVE.
- [sighs] I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

31:54.050 --> 31:56.143
WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE ON THE LIST.

31:56.190 --> 31:59.045
IS THERE ANY WAY WE COULD--
- MA'AM.

31:59.080 --> 32:00.149
- GET IN--OH, GOD.
- MA'AM, I NEED YOU TO

32:00.190 --> 32:02.112
GET BACK IN LINE.
- DID YOU NOT GET THE HANDBOOK?

32:02.160 --> 32:04.845
'CAUSE THAT JUST CUTS
LIKE A KNIFE, I'M JUST SAYING.

32:04.880 --> 32:06.393
- MISS.
- OKAY, THANK YOU.

32:06.440 --> 32:08.396
- PLEASE GET BACK IN THE LINE.
- I KNOW MUSIC, I'M TELLING YOU.

32:08.440 --> 32:09.919
- I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

32:09.960 --> 32:11.746
OKAY, I WOULD--
ANYTHING, OKAY.

32:11.790 --> 32:14.475
WE'RE RIGHT BACK THERE,
WITH THE...

32:14.510 --> 32:17.092
- HERE SHE COMES.

32:17.140 --> 32:18.687
HOW'D THAT GO?

32:18.720 --> 32:20.961
- THAT WENT REALLY WELL.
HE SAID JUST A FEW MORE MINUTES.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.035
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

32:22.070 --> 32:23.276
- AWESOME.
- YEAH.

32:23.320 --> 32:24.890
YEAH, HE FOUND OUR NAMES
ON THE LIST.

32:24.940 --> 32:26.453
- REALLY?
- MM-HMM.

32:26.490 --> 32:27.969
- I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

32:28.010 --> 32:30.387
- [mutters]

32:33.150 --> 32:34.560
- LOOK AT THIS.
HOW ABOUT THAT RIGHT THERE?

32:34.600 --> 32:35.635

32:35.670 --> 32:38.082
THAT PIECE HAS AN EDGE,
IT COULD NEVER GO THERE.
