00:01.000 --> 00:03.588
In New York City's war on crime,

00:03.588 --> 00:06.778
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:06.778 --> 00:08.686
of the Major Case Squad.

00:08.686 --> 00:10.704
These are their stories.

00:14.166 --> 00:16.684
Allahu Akbar.

00:18.636 --> 00:21.129
Allahu Akbar.

00:22.524 --> 00:25.124
Allahu Akbar.

00:25.416 --> 00:27.874
Allahu Akbar.

01:05.876 --> 01:10.186
Chilly, don't leave these behind.
He wears bikinis.

02:20.951 --> 02:23.382
Cold beer.
Cold beer here.

02:23.791 --> 02:26.618
Cold beer. Cold beer here.
Nice, cold beer.

02:26.618 --> 02:28.405
Cold beer.

02:28.847 --> 02:31.050
Cold beer. Cold beer.

02:31.484 --> 02:34.332
Dude, look what I found.

02:34.586 --> 02:36.300
This is awesome.

02:36.300 --> 02:38.363
It's probably worth a lot of money.

03:45.598 --> 03:48.574
Floater in a scuba suit washing up
on the hottest day of the year.

03:48.574 --> 03:51.207
No ID.
He might have been stabbed.

03:51.207 --> 03:54.051
I hate the beach.
Why call major case?

03:54.051 --> 03:56.962
Someone called the FBI
told them he looked Middle Eastern.

03:56.962 --> 03:58.735
Thought you'd want to get here
before they did.

03:58.735 --> 04:01.532
What about the coast guard?
Anyone call in a missing diver?

04:01.532 --> 04:02.911
Not in two weeks.

04:02.911 --> 04:05.004
Seems fresher than that.

04:07.962 --> 04:12.221
Yeah, his corneas,
they're not even cloudy.

04:12.221 --> 04:14.641
He's been in the water
less than a day.

04:14.641 --> 04:16.564
And who decided
that he was Middle Eastern?

04:16.564 --> 04:20.860
I mean, take a look around.
Half our CSU guys look like him.

04:22.780 --> 04:25.456
Digital camera might
have a date stamp.

04:25.456 --> 04:27.599
Might even have a picture of his killer.

04:27.599 --> 04:30.770
We got entry wounds...
Right here on his side.

04:30.770 --> 04:32.656
Something penetrated his suit.

04:32.656 --> 04:34.390
And slashed his air tube.

04:34.390 --> 04:36.650
It's a closed circuit re-breather.

04:36.995 --> 04:39.669
Agent Corbett, FBI.

04:40.011 --> 04:41.850
Instead of exhaling into the water,

04:41.850 --> 04:44.127
the diver breathes out
to that CO2 scrubber.

04:44.127 --> 04:46.371
Come back at him as oxygen.

04:46.882 --> 04:49.180
No bubbles.
Technical divers use it

04:49.180 --> 04:51.333
when they stay underwater
for long periods of time.

04:51.333 --> 04:53.148
Or a terrorist who doesn't
wanna be detected

04:53.148 --> 04:56.648
while he's taking pictures of
our underwater gas lines.

04:57.098 --> 04:59.017
So you think he's a terrorist?

04:59.017 --> 05:02.165
Why else would someone
go diving in this muck?

05:02.165 --> 05:03.732
It's late summer, you know.

05:03.732 --> 05:07.793
Gulf stream brings in non-native
species from the Caribbean.

05:07.793 --> 05:11.165
Yeah, butterfly fish.
You know angel fish.

05:11.165 --> 05:13.268
You'd be surprised.

05:13.496 --> 05:17.824
If I find any pictures of Nemo,
you'll be the first one I call.

05:28.272 --> 05:30.794
He drowned?
He was stabbed.

05:30.794 --> 05:34.314
Twice. In the side.
Pierced his kidney.

05:34.314 --> 05:37.588
Didn't kill him, but made it hard for him
to swim to the surface.

05:37.588 --> 05:39.060
What was he stabbed with?

05:39.060 --> 05:41.848
Based on the morphology
of the wound blunt on top,

05:41.848 --> 05:44.446
serrated on the bottom,
a notch right there,

05:44.446 --> 05:46.623
it'd be something like this.

05:46.623 --> 05:48.990
This knife's his,
but the killer would have had his own.

05:48.990 --> 05:51.950
And they say it's safer
to dive with a partner.

05:52.232 --> 05:53.951
Good morning, Rogers.

05:53.951 --> 05:54.947
Captain.

05:54.947 --> 05:58.862
FBI matched the prints from the body
with a British national.

05:58.862 --> 06:00.549
They give you a name?

06:00.549 --> 06:02.687
We've been summoned.

06:03.241 --> 06:07.232
Our lab managed to salvage these photos.
From the diver's camera.

06:07.232 --> 06:10.018
Underwater natural gas line.

06:11.059 --> 06:13.216
Holland Tunnel.

06:14.737 --> 06:17.697
Retaining wall near the UN.

06:17.697 --> 06:20.158
All high value targets.

06:20.158 --> 06:22.273
As for the deceased,

06:22.273 --> 06:24.854
inspector Lindsay
from Scotland yard will take over.

06:24.854 --> 06:27.304
Diver's name is Tarek Agiza.

06:27.304 --> 06:29.964
Goes by the western name of Rick.

06:29.964 --> 06:32.062
29, born in Egypt.

06:32.062 --> 06:35.348
Comes from a scholarly family
of Islamic extremists.

06:35.348 --> 06:38.751
- Which one, Jamaat Al-Islamiyya?
- You got it.

06:38.751 --> 06:42.274
His father and grandfather
have been active since the 70s.

06:42.274 --> 06:45.940
Rick has mostly managed
to stay under the radar.

06:45.940 --> 06:47.095
Mostly?

06:47.095 --> 06:49.741
You arrested him for something
non-terror related?

06:49.741 --> 06:51.529
Yeah, for public drunkenness in 2000.

06:51.529 --> 06:54.576
Shortly after he arrived in London
to start University.

06:54.576 --> 06:56.220
He dropped out after 9/11.

06:56.220 --> 06:59.341
Since then, Rick has traveled
extensively to Muslim countries.

06:59.341 --> 07:04.880
Or ones with large Muslim communities.
Croatia, New Zealand, Indonesia.

07:04.880 --> 07:08.094
New Zealand. Wow.

07:09.305 --> 07:14.037
Is there a large community
of Muslims in New Zealand?

07:14.037 --> 07:16.780
Relatively small, but growing fast.

07:16.780 --> 07:19.083
All this travel,
how's he pay for it?

07:19.083 --> 07:21.338
He has no known job,
but look in his bank account,

07:21.338 --> 07:24.996
and, oh my, erratic deposits
of large amounts of cash.

07:24.996 --> 07:29.039
So, protocol, we'll continue with
the murder investigation.

07:29.039 --> 07:31.255
While we track down
the rest of Rick's cell.

07:31.255 --> 07:36.264
Remember, Patriot Act gives us
certain liberties regarding searches.

07:36.541 --> 07:38.711
We'll keep each other posted.

07:38.938 --> 07:42.362
Hopefully Rick's terror cell
won't get past the research stage.

07:42.362 --> 07:45.814
Rick dropped out of college
and was arrested for drinking.

07:45.814 --> 07:48.328
Aren't terrorist supposed
to be a little more disciplined than that?

07:48.328 --> 07:51.064
Well, with his family history,
maybe he didn't wanna fit the profile.

07:51.064 --> 07:53.631
Yeah, or maybe he's just
the black sheep of the family.

07:53.631 --> 07:58.256
And his travel.
Could be another explanation.

07:59.188 --> 08:01.823
We gotta go back to Coney Island.

08:02.163 --> 08:05.378
I'm out here every day, I told you.

08:08.712 --> 08:12.697
You keep on ignoring
the beeps, why is that?

08:12.945 --> 08:16.293
Can you tell the difference between
a bottle cap and a coin with that thing?

08:16.293 --> 08:18.598
Oh, yeah, yeah.
It beeps different.

08:18.598 --> 08:22.034
My partner, he loves Gadgets.

08:23.062 --> 08:27.053
I hid a bottle cap and a coin.
Tell me which is which.

08:30.865 --> 08:33.703
- There's your bottle cap.
- Yeah?

08:34.847 --> 08:36.751
That's coin.

08:38.530 --> 08:41.356
That's another coin.

08:41.356 --> 08:43.683
This a new hobby for you, Walter?

08:43.683 --> 08:46.091
Yesterday, when the body washed up,

08:46.091 --> 08:50.242
you and a bunch of guys
were looking for something. What?

08:50.560 --> 08:54.600
Dammit, I gave that kid ten bucks
and an icy for that coin.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.787
And I let him keep the fish
he found it in.

08:56.787 --> 08:58.320
A fish with a coin in its mouth?

08:58.320 --> 09:00.051
Where did you read that,
in the Bible, Walter?

09:00.051 --> 09:02.587
In its belly.
Bluefish will eat anything.

09:02.587 --> 09:04.704
I don't believe it.

09:13.331 --> 09:15.715
We're gonna wanna borrow this.

09:15.715 --> 09:18.121
You just, um...

09:21.535 --> 09:23.792
It's an 1861 double eagle.

09:23.792 --> 09:25.103
Is this what Rick was after?

09:25.103 --> 09:27.662
Exotic travel, unexplained cash.

09:27.662 --> 09:31.874
Rick wasn't a terrorist.
He was a treasure hunter.

10:10.664 --> 10:14.862
- I'll take one of those.
- What, you still don't trust me?

10:20.294 --> 10:22.175
Where's Rick? Huh?

10:22.175 --> 10:23.618
- What?
- What's he doing?

10:23.618 --> 10:26.152
I don't know.
I swear to God I don't know.

10:45.367 --> 10:47.420
Okay.

10:47.420 --> 10:50.509
All right. Have it your way.

10:50.509 --> 10:53.704
One key for you, one key for me.

10:53.704 --> 10:57.998
Until we hear from Rick...
You and me stick together.

11:08.613 --> 11:10.124
What do we know about the diver?

11:10.124 --> 11:13.926
Every country Rick Agiza traveled
to has a coast known for wreck diving.

11:13.926 --> 11:15.253
Including here.

11:15.253 --> 11:20.036
This area between Long Island
and New Jersey, it's called wreck valley.

11:20.036 --> 11:22.017
Each X marks a sunken ship.

11:22.017 --> 11:23.925
Well, it marks some of them.
There are thousands.

11:23.925 --> 11:27.922
Dating back to the 1600s.
Privateer ships, gunrunners, slave ships.

11:27.922 --> 11:32.094
So Rick's dive partner killed him
then framed him as a terrorist.

11:32.094 --> 11:34.553
Modern day pirates
still killing over treasure.

11:34.553 --> 11:37.296
Divers and recovery companies
are supposed to file for permission

11:37.296 --> 11:40.196
before bringing anything up,
so check the court records,

11:40.196 --> 11:41.743
but don't hold your breath.

11:41.743 --> 11:46.855
You know, one 1861 gold coin
sells for around $3,000.

11:46.855 --> 11:48.645
You mean sold for 3,000.

11:48.645 --> 11:53.715
In the last two days, prices have
dropped on several civil war-era coins.

11:56.362 --> 11:59.005
I'd give you 800 bucks.

11:59.276 --> 12:03.796
Well, for Pete's sake,
it's a 150 years old.

12:03.796 --> 12:07.006
The numismatic market
is extremely volatile.

12:07.006 --> 12:09.313
- Take it somewhere else.
- We already did.

12:09.313 --> 12:11.572
They said you're the guy
who buys stolen coins.

12:11.572 --> 12:13.171
Oh, man. Those were stolen?

12:13.171 --> 12:15.649
No, she told me that she inherited them
from her great aunt.

12:15.649 --> 12:17.536
She. Let me guess,

12:17.536 --> 12:20.544
she was pretty
and you didn't ask questions.

12:20.544 --> 12:23.592
Between you and I, she was smokin'.

12:23.804 --> 12:25.094
How smokin'?

12:25.094 --> 12:27.317
Kinda old. Like, 28.

12:27.317 --> 12:30.595
But kickass body,
short, blond hair.

12:30.801 --> 12:32.905
Did she bring any double eagles?

12:32.905 --> 12:35.005
Maybe a couple.

12:35.005 --> 12:36.299
Or more.

12:36.299 --> 12:39.196
I checked the police sheet.
None of these were reported stolen.

12:39.196 --> 12:41.600
Did you even ask for ID?

12:41.600 --> 12:44.116
I was asking for her license,
but she flew out of here.

12:44.116 --> 12:46.091
- She was getting a ticket.
- Yeah, right.

12:46.091 --> 12:49.855
No, really, she was parked
in front of the hydrant.

12:50.131 --> 12:52.902
Meter maid wouldn't cut her a break.

12:54.155 --> 12:57.113
I got 9 company cars
and 15 authorized drivers.

12:57.113 --> 12:58.960
I have no idea who got this ticket.

12:58.960 --> 13:01.809
So this would be the bright pink
Benz convertible

13:01.809 --> 13:04.975
driven by a smokin blond with a great body.

13:04.975 --> 13:07.290
Maybe your girlfriend.

13:07.290 --> 13:09.022
Somebody you'd want to be your girlfriend.

13:09.022 --> 13:11.628
She's my wife, buddy.

13:13.342 --> 13:15.710
Dana and I are separated.

13:15.710 --> 13:18.766
- Recently?
- Two years ago.

13:18.766 --> 13:20.863
But she still works with you
here at Camelot.

13:20.863 --> 13:22.995
No, not for two years.

13:22.995 --> 13:25.215
Dana's a diver. It's...

13:25.215 --> 13:29.269
one of two things
she has a special talent for.

13:29.567 --> 13:33.926
She ever dive with a guy named
Rick Agiza?

13:35.501 --> 13:37.218
I wouldn't know.

13:37.218 --> 13:38.792
We're out of touch.

13:38.792 --> 13:41.202
What's the last address
you have for her, Mr. Stipe?

13:41.202 --> 13:44.847
It's a condo on Manhattan beach
two years old.

13:44.847 --> 13:47.382
I gave her the down payment.

13:47.752 --> 13:49.678
Do me a favor.

13:49.678 --> 13:52.912
Tell her to pay
her own parking tickets.

14:00.841 --> 14:02.609
Guess she didn't bother to tell Stipe

14:02.609 --> 14:05.410
she cashed out his condo
and traded down for this.

14:05.410 --> 14:07.053
Wait for a warrant?

14:07.053 --> 14:11.328
I don't know, it's still an active
terror investigation.

14:13.555 --> 14:17.980
I got three pairs of Jimmy Choo heels.

14:18.585 --> 14:21.300
Four Versace dressed, never worn.

14:21.300 --> 14:24.374
Looks like Dana went on a shopping spree.

14:26.233 --> 14:27.835
Eames.

14:32.147 --> 14:35.091
I've got Rick Agiza's passport.

14:35.445 --> 14:38.016
So he's staying here?

14:42.490 --> 14:46.356
I can see a European in these.

14:47.496 --> 14:49.401
But these?

14:50.874 --> 14:52.534
Different size.

14:52.534 --> 14:55.637
Another guy.
Dana's been busy.

15:06.070 --> 15:07.727
Last call was from Camelot.

15:07.727 --> 15:10.510
Maybe Stipe did know she moved.

15:10.510 --> 15:13.889
- 2:00 pm.
- Right after we left.

15:13.889 --> 15:18.105
So he sent us on a goose chase
and then tipped her off.

15:21.972 --> 15:24.815
Uh, excuse me, Mr. Harper.

15:26.002 --> 15:28.218
- Do I know you?
- My name's Chilly.

15:28.218 --> 15:30.293
I work with Rick.

15:30.793 --> 15:34.402
I need to talk to you
about the expedition.

15:34.402 --> 15:39.257
Uh, Derek, why don't you
get us a couple lattes?

15:43.672 --> 15:46.044
I'm not sure if you know this,

15:46.044 --> 15:48.368
but we found something down there.

15:48.368 --> 15:50.702
A lot more than Rick told you about.

15:50.702 --> 15:53.485
It's gonna cost a lot to bring it out.

15:54.455 --> 15:57.263
I didn't tip Dana off.

15:57.263 --> 15:59.281
I called to tell her
I want my car back.

15:59.281 --> 16:01.399
You're a bad liar, Mr. Stipe.

16:01.399 --> 16:05.084
Which brings us
to your wife's lover, Rick Agiza.

16:05.084 --> 16:06.502
Sure you don't remember him?

16:06.502 --> 16:11.255
Yeah, okay, Rick did a job for me
in Charleston a few years ago.

16:11.677 --> 16:14.768
He was trying to con my clients
into financing his expedition.

16:14.768 --> 16:16.500
- Now, if you will excuse me...
- Hey, hey, hey...

16:16.500 --> 16:21.882
You think we could see a picture of Dana?
You don't happen to have one, do you?

16:28.070 --> 16:30.113
Wow, she's beautiful.

16:30.997 --> 16:34.233
Guess you could see it
all day long right there.

16:34.974 --> 16:36.932
Guess you're still in love with her, huh?

16:36.932 --> 16:40.039
Makes me wonder how far
you'd go to get her back.

16:40.039 --> 16:42.459
Maybe this far?

16:43.425 --> 16:47.339
Someone killed Rick
while he was still underwater.

16:48.410 --> 16:50.655
- I had nothing to do with this.
- Come on, man.

16:50.655 --> 16:54.626
You own of the largest wreck recovery
businesses in the east coast.

16:54.626 --> 16:58.779
You're telling me that you had nothing to do
with Dana's dive in wreck valley.

16:58.779 --> 17:00.306
I can't dive.

17:00.306 --> 17:03.351
I tore my labyrinthine
membrane five years ago.

17:05.602 --> 17:07.631
All right, then it's not you, it's Dana.

17:07.631 --> 17:10.705
Dana would never willingly go along
with something like this.

17:10.705 --> 17:12.561
Willingly?

17:14.092 --> 17:17.660
Yesterday, when I called to ask her
what this was all about,

17:17.660 --> 17:22.179
she sounded... off, like someone else
was in the room.

17:22.179 --> 17:23.445
Did you hear a voice?

17:23.445 --> 17:27.641
No, but I know Dana's.
I could hear fear in it.

17:28.160 --> 17:31.083
And that's why I told her
to get out of there.

17:31.083 --> 17:32.441
And go where?

17:32.441 --> 17:34.289
Well, how would I know?

17:34.736 --> 17:38.514
Before yesterday, I hadn't
talked to her in over a year.

17:40.715 --> 17:43.166
They found Dana Stipe's
pink Benz at JFK,

17:43.166 --> 17:44.882
but there's no flight record.

17:44.882 --> 17:48.122
And she hasn't used her credit
card or cell phone since yesterday.

17:48.122 --> 17:51.052
And we believe Stipe when he says
he hasn't been in contact with her.

17:51.052 --> 17:52.161
I pulled his LUDs.

17:52.161 --> 17:54.928
He called her obsessively
for the first six months,

17:54.928 --> 17:57.880
then went cold turkey till yesterday.

17:57.880 --> 18:00.774
Doesn't rule out Stipe
as Agiza's murderer.

18:00.774 --> 18:02.006
That's all we need to know.

18:02.006 --> 18:07.036
So Stipe's doctor confirms that
he has an inner ear condition.

18:07.036 --> 18:09.223
He can only dive as deep as a pool.

18:09.223 --> 18:13.159
Well, then maybe he captained the boat
and Dana killed Agiza.

18:13.159 --> 18:14.378
Or maybe there's a third man.

18:14.378 --> 18:17.834
Stipe told us that he sensed
someone else in the room

18:17.834 --> 18:19.896
threatening Dana
when he spoke to her.

18:19.896 --> 18:24.554
And we did find two different sizes
of men's underwear at her place.

18:24.554 --> 18:26.917
If there was someone else
on the treasure dive,

18:26.917 --> 18:30.202
whoever funded the expedition
might know who it was.

18:30.202 --> 18:32.005
Take a look at Stipe's investor list.

18:32.005 --> 18:34.670
Tell him we'll subpoena
if he doesn't hand it over.

18:38.666 --> 18:42.471
I met Rick on a dive I funded in Charleston.

18:42.471 --> 18:45.510
The Philomela?
Tom Stipe said it was a civil war wreck.

18:45.510 --> 18:47.647
Yes, they never found it.

18:47.647 --> 18:51.191
And then over Christmas
I bumped into Rick in St. Bart's.

18:51.191 --> 18:53.315
Was he with this woman?

18:55.458 --> 18:56.916
No.

18:56.916 --> 18:59.100
That was the first time
Rick and I hung out.

18:59.100 --> 19:02.959
He's charismatic.
Great ocean stories.

19:02.959 --> 19:05.396
My wife and I were enthralled.

19:05.396 --> 19:07.162
Well, after enthralling you,

19:07.162 --> 19:10.115
did he approach you
about the dive in wreck valley?

19:10.115 --> 19:14.220
Yes, he said he had a good lead
on a revolutionary war era ship.

19:14.220 --> 19:15.797
Revolutionary war?

19:15.797 --> 19:19.011
We were told that it was civil war era.

19:19.011 --> 19:22.142
Must be a different expedition.

19:22.944 --> 19:24.530
Excuse me.

19:25.918 --> 19:28.948
Here's a copy of his proposal.

19:29.493 --> 19:32.437
Maps, sketches, budget.

19:32.437 --> 19:36.049
The HMS Falkirk.
After the battle.

19:36.049 --> 19:38.640
We don't have any record
of you applying for ownership.

19:38.640 --> 19:41.423
Well, Rick said they hadn't...
found anything yet.

19:41.423 --> 19:44.270
I've been calling him for days.

19:44.270 --> 19:48.991
He won't be calling you back.
Rick's body washed up on Monday.

19:50.504 --> 19:53.789
Oh, my God.

19:56.293 --> 20:00.349
I didn't realize...

20:00.349 --> 20:03.514
Something you're not
telling us, Mr. Harper?

20:04.602 --> 20:10.598
Yesterday I was approached by this man
who called himself Chilly.

20:10.598 --> 20:12.384
He said he's working on the dive.

20:12.384 --> 20:15.543
And that Rick took off
with my seed money.

20:15.543 --> 20:17.885
50 grand.

20:18.503 --> 20:19.901
You call the cops?

20:19.901 --> 20:22.368
I was waiting to hear
Rick's side of the story.

20:22.368 --> 20:26.353
This man, Chilly, he knew Rick
wasn't coming back.

20:26.353 --> 20:29.545
Did he want money?
To further the expedition?

20:29.545 --> 20:33.502
Yes, he wanted half a million to launch
a full-scale operation.

20:33.502 --> 20:36.011
I tried to get a number, an address.

20:36.011 --> 20:39.107
He said he lived on a boat.
That' he'd get in touch with me.

20:39.107 --> 20:41.326
What'd he look like?

20:41.326 --> 20:46.269
Six foot. Athletic, tan.
I'm not good with faces.

20:46.549 --> 20:49.792
Detectives, this is my wife Trisha.

20:53.621 --> 20:56.785
You're, uh... congratulations.

20:56.785 --> 20:58.063
Thank you.

20:58.063 --> 20:59.461
- Are we done here?
- Yes.

20:59.461 --> 21:02.376
If... if you hear from your
friend again, Mr. Harper,

21:02.376 --> 21:05.075
- give us a call.
- I certainly will.

21:05.075 --> 21:06.955
You don't by chance
know what you're having?

21:06.955 --> 21:08.417
A boy.

21:08.417 --> 21:10.030
Simon Harper IV?

21:10.030 --> 21:12.645
Oh, we were thinking of Josiah.

21:13.001 --> 21:14.646
Nice.

21:16.659 --> 21:19.614
Well, if he was hanging out
at a marina with Dana,

21:19.614 --> 21:22.045
someone will remember her.

21:23.119 --> 21:25.429
Sure, who wouldn't remember her?

21:25.429 --> 21:27.934
A girl like that who can
captain a grand banks?

21:27.934 --> 21:30.842
- She have her own boat?
- Nah.

21:30.842 --> 21:32.983
She and some guy worked Chilly's boat.

21:32.983 --> 21:34.743
Chilly?

21:35.026 --> 21:37.108
He's the treasure hunter, right?

21:38.098 --> 21:41.700
Takes people fishing, dives.
You know, anything to make a buck.

21:41.700 --> 21:44.397
- His boat here now?
- It was here at sunrise.

21:44.397 --> 21:46.646
But when I got back at 3:00,
it was gone.

21:48.192 --> 21:49.964
All right, thanks.

22:29.746 --> 22:34.268
Well, it doesn't look like Chilly's boat
was headed towards Harper's treasure.

22:34.268 --> 22:36.718
Wreck site is closer to Southern Jersey.

22:36.718 --> 22:40.053
The suspects went in the opposite direction,
heading northeast.

22:40.053 --> 22:42.243
Hugging the coast
of Long Island for an hour.

22:42.243 --> 22:43.981
Then they shut off their GPS.

22:43.981 --> 22:46.505
Chilly's boat should be in this area.

23:04.575 --> 23:06.340
Dana Stipe.

23:07.496 --> 23:09.162
Chilly?

23:13.958 --> 23:16.720
Someone pulled the anchor.

23:17.066 --> 23:20.095
There's no one on this ship.
It's a ghost ship.

23:40.387 --> 23:44.452
So they used these lift bags
to bring up the buckets of coins.

23:45.105 --> 23:47.200
Could be Dana's size.

23:47.200 --> 23:49.531
I found a computer.

23:52.841 --> 23:54.662
Still wet.

24:01.126 --> 24:04.813
In the trash.
A folder named Rick.

24:09.906 --> 24:12.757
Those are the photos from the FBI
from Rick's camera.

24:12.757 --> 24:15.524
On Chilly's computer.

24:16.161 --> 24:21.310
Chilly might have framed Rick
as a terrorist before he killed him.

24:22.066 --> 24:25.951
So, Dana and Chilly, they took
the rest of the treasure.

24:25.951 --> 24:28.593
Staged their disappearance.

24:29.717 --> 24:32.652
If they did, they'd need another boat.

24:32.652 --> 24:35.506
I wonder where Dana would go to get one.

24:35.915 --> 24:37.431
Yeah, that's Chilly.

24:37.431 --> 24:40.506
His real name is Stan Chilton.

24:40.506 --> 24:44.601
Used him as a day hire on charter boats.

24:44.601 --> 24:47.597
He's working with Dana?

24:47.862 --> 24:50.300
It looks like more than that.

24:50.679 --> 24:53.323
From you to Rick to Chilly.

24:53.323 --> 24:55.491
Dana's trading down.

24:55.491 --> 25:00.913
You're the only one who actually...
cared about Dana, aren't you?

25:02.587 --> 25:06.985
Come on, Mr. Stipe.
Where is she?

25:07.279 --> 25:08.452
I don't know.

25:08.452 --> 25:11.385
Yesterday afternoon where were you?

25:14.436 --> 25:19.199
I was on my way to see
a client in Connecticut.

25:21.323 --> 25:24.918
Dana is like...
she's like a black widow.

25:24.918 --> 25:28.608
Isn't she? And you're just staring at that
red hourglass on her belly.

25:28.608 --> 25:31.949
And you're just thinking
that she's not gonna bite.

25:40.742 --> 25:42.371
Stipe's covering for Dana.

25:42.371 --> 25:46.871
I can't tell if he's in on it,
or if he's protecting her out of stupidity.

25:46.871 --> 25:49.960
Meanwhile, Dana's probably
on some beach with Chilly.

25:49.960 --> 25:53.937
Unlikely. A fishing boat found Chilly's body
off the coast of Fire Island.

25:53.937 --> 25:56.710
According to Rogers,
it's not a pretty picture.

25:56.710 --> 26:00.956
Whether Stipe's stupid or in on it,
he's lying.

26:00.956 --> 26:03.148
Call the coast guard
and the harbor unit.

26:03.148 --> 26:07.206
Have them search every boat
owned by Camelot undersea recovery.

26:10.487 --> 26:13.501
I'll add this to the list of "things
I didn't need to see."

26:13.501 --> 26:16.639
Worst example of Caisson disease
I've ever seen.

26:16.639 --> 26:19.564
The bends are rarely fatal.
What killed him? An embolism?

26:19.564 --> 26:20.830
Yeah.

26:20.830 --> 26:23.542
The excess nitrogen
formed bubbles in his blood,

26:23.542 --> 26:25.716
one of them got to his heart
and stopped it.

26:25.716 --> 26:30.388
But he'd know better
than to ascend too quickly.

26:30.388 --> 26:32.907
Something made him panic.

26:33.197 --> 26:35.302
Like the sight of his anchor pulling up?

26:35.302 --> 26:36.957
It was on the deck of his boat.

26:36.957 --> 26:39.039
He was in open water?

26:39.509 --> 26:41.186
That'd do it.

26:41.428 --> 26:43.761
Yeah, Goren.

26:43.761 --> 26:46.454
Okay, thanks.
Harbor unit found Dana.

26:46.667 --> 26:50.466
I should have gone to the cops
when Rick disappeared,

26:50.466 --> 26:52.681
but I panicked.

26:52.681 --> 26:54.497
I can get helpless.

26:54.497 --> 26:56.378
It's not my best side.

26:56.378 --> 27:00.265
So you turned to Chilly for support.

27:00.524 --> 27:02.463
Is that what he told you?

27:03.187 --> 27:06.122
I had to sleep with Chilly.

27:06.122 --> 27:08.497
He thought Rick and I
were cheating him,

27:08.497 --> 27:11.937
and I just wanted to show him
that he could trust me.

27:11.937 --> 27:13.947
That helpless thing again.

27:13.947 --> 27:20.888
How much treasure did the three of you...
bring up, Dana?

27:20.888 --> 27:24.911
Just a handful, I swear.

27:24.911 --> 27:28.550
Enough to buy three pairs of Jimmy Choos
and four Versace dresses.

27:28.550 --> 27:34.073
And those diamond earrings
really highlight your tan.

27:35.460 --> 27:38.482
Okay, so we skimmed
a little bit off the top.

27:38.482 --> 27:41.049
What, you've never worked as a waitress?

27:41.728 --> 27:45.132
Blonde like you?
I'm sure you did.

27:45.583 --> 27:48.747
I mean, Rick and Chilly said that there's
so many trunks down there,

27:48.747 --> 27:51.441
nobody was gonna miss
a handful of coins.

27:51.441 --> 27:54.060
What about your employer,
Simon Harper?

27:54.060 --> 27:57.519
Well, Rick said Harper
didn't care about the money.

27:57.519 --> 28:00.303
He was just looking for a thrill.

28:00.303 --> 28:04.484
I had no idea that Rick was dead
until Tommy called me.

28:04.484 --> 28:07.207
Tommy. Tom Stipe,
your ex-husband.

28:07.207 --> 28:08.837
Yeah.

28:08.837 --> 28:11.329
He called when I was with Chilly.

28:11.329 --> 28:13.566
And he somehow sensed
that I was in trouble.

28:13.566 --> 28:18.192
So he said to go hide out
on our old boat, The Guinevere.

28:18.421 --> 28:20.450
He'd take care of me.

28:26.591 --> 28:28.375
That's nice.

28:30.800 --> 28:35.753
Let's see. He did.
He took care of you.

28:36.025 --> 28:38.062
Oh, my God.

28:40.522 --> 28:44.532
Well, don't get all helpless now.
You have a bigger problem.

28:44.532 --> 28:48.097
We have evidence
you were on Chilly's boat.

28:50.047 --> 28:51.972
You can't think I did this.

28:51.972 --> 28:53.914
Oh, now I can.

28:54.207 --> 28:57.426
Yeah. Well, you sent Chilly
down for the treasure.

28:57.426 --> 29:01.893
You had Tom come along
with one of his boats.

29:01.893 --> 29:03.139
You know, you went away.

29:03.139 --> 29:05.798
You left Chilly to claw his way
to the surface.

29:05.798 --> 29:10.498
No, I've been dry docked
on Tommy's boat for the last two days.

29:13.500 --> 29:15.240
Where's you stash, Dana?

29:15.240 --> 29:18.408
It... it's at a warehouse.

29:18.408 --> 29:21.127
Chilly and I each had a key.

29:35.748 --> 29:38.739
You gotta be freaking kidding me!
Damn it.

29:38.739 --> 29:40.707
Someone other than Chilly have the key?

29:40.707 --> 29:44.658
No. No, I bought the locks myself.
It was just me and him.

29:44.658 --> 29:46.325
You guys show anybody else
where the treasure was?

29:46.325 --> 29:49.796
No... why would... I...

29:52.959 --> 29:56.159
Oh... Tommy.

29:56.159 --> 30:00.087
That baldheaded little bastard.

30:00.087 --> 30:02.710
I should have known never to trust him.

30:04.483 --> 30:07.114
Chilly is a loose cannon.

30:07.114 --> 30:10.076
With the money involved,
I knew he was a threat to Dana.

30:10.076 --> 30:14.334
I gave her a port in the storm.

30:14.334 --> 30:21.664
Well, this is the chance you've been
waiting for with Dana, isn't it?

30:22.340 --> 30:23.208
How's that?

30:23.208 --> 30:26.358
Well, a chance to restore... Camelot.

30:26.358 --> 30:29.398
You know, Dana's your Guinevere.

30:29.398 --> 30:32.535
Name of the boat that we found her on.
That's sweet.

30:32.535 --> 30:36.559
You killed Rick because
he stole your queen.

30:37.227 --> 30:40.748
I couldn't have killed Rick.
I can't dive.

30:40.748 --> 30:43.032
So you had Chilly do it for you.

30:43.032 --> 30:46.671
But whoever killed Chilly
didn't need to dive.

30:46.671 --> 30:49.676
He just had to pull anchor.

30:49.925 --> 30:52.597
He died of the bends,
trying to save himself.

30:52.597 --> 30:57.306
Our ME told us it was an agonizing death.

30:57.930 --> 31:01.205
I could never do this to another diver.

31:01.630 --> 31:05.461
Dana has an alibi.
She was on your boat.

31:05.461 --> 31:10.860
Every guy at the marina watched her
bronze herself on the deck.

31:10.860 --> 31:13.695
Who's gonna vouch for you?

31:18.448 --> 31:22.646
Dana's gonna let me go down for this.

31:22.646 --> 31:27.298
God. I have done nothing
but help her out with you,

31:27.298 --> 31:30.354
with the Chilly... warehouse.

31:30.354 --> 31:32.715
That warehouse, did you help her...

31:32.715 --> 31:36.006
- Or did you just help yourself?
- What?

31:36.006 --> 31:37.937
No, I...

31:37.937 --> 31:41.189
She told me where it was.
I never went there.

31:47.751 --> 31:51.375
This is what happens
when you can't let go of your ex.

31:51.375 --> 31:52.889
So much for Camelot.

31:52.889 --> 31:55.678
Dana had Chilly kill Rick.

31:55.678 --> 31:57.505
And then had Stipe kill Chilly.

31:57.505 --> 32:01.822
She takes the money,
and leaves Stipe holding the lift bag.

32:02.746 --> 32:05.614
Um, maybe.

32:08.029 --> 32:10.286
Uh, excuse me, counselor.

32:10.286 --> 32:16.900
Mr. Stipe, uh, a minute ago you told me
that you helped Dana with the warehouse.

32:16.900 --> 32:19.036
What did you mean?

32:20.902 --> 32:24.513
Simon Harper called me... really upset.

32:24.513 --> 32:27.713
He knew Chilly and Dana
had taken some of the treasure.

32:27.713 --> 32:29.955
He wanted it back.

32:30.971 --> 32:34.589
So you were, um...

32:34.589 --> 32:37.328
So you played the middle man.

32:39.223 --> 32:41.337
Yeah.

32:43.252 --> 32:47.252
And you told Harper
where the warehouse was.

32:53.473 --> 32:56.787
I never called Stipe.
I dealt exclusively with Rick.

32:56.787 --> 32:59.870
Until that other con artist came up to me.

32:59.870 --> 33:02.921
Tom Stipe said he told you
where the coins were.

33:02.921 --> 33:04.888
And now they're gone.

33:05.115 --> 33:10.073
Sister, I manage hundreds of millions
of dollars through my family trust.

33:10.073 --> 33:13.022
I don't need a bunch of coins
to support my family.

33:13.022 --> 33:15.436
In fact, you don't need to work at all
to support your family.

33:15.436 --> 33:17.460
No, I don't.

33:17.460 --> 33:19.937
Nor do I need to get caught up
in a murder investigation.

33:19.937 --> 33:23.034
Or two. We found Chilly's body
near Fire Island.

33:23.034 --> 33:25.829
He'd been diving at the wreck site.

33:25.829 --> 33:29.001
No, that's wrong.
That's nowhere near my wreck site.

33:29.001 --> 33:31.772
All right, maybe Rick lied to you
to confuse you.

33:31.772 --> 33:35.321
He obviously lied to you
about what kind of ship it was.

33:35.321 --> 33:39.975
Revolutionary war ship wouldn't be
carrying coins from the 1860s.

33:39.975 --> 33:42.852
My point exactly.
Obviously, that's not my ship.

33:42.852 --> 33:45.128
Rick take you to the wreck site?

33:45.128 --> 33:49.708
No, I was waiting to hear back from him
about that day he disappeared.

33:50.781 --> 33:53.914
It's my wife.
She may be going into labor.

33:53.914 --> 33:56.904
Oh, okay.
Uh, we'll be in touch.

33:57.974 --> 34:01.399
Why would he hire treasure hunters
if he doesn't want the treasure?

34:01.399 --> 34:03.597
This isn't the first ship
he's tried to salvage.

34:03.597 --> 34:06.948
He hired Stipe two years ago
to find a wreck in Charleston.

34:06.948 --> 34:08.505
Now, that was a civil war wreck.

34:08.505 --> 34:11.400
Harper said that they never found it.

34:12.300 --> 34:14.402
So find it.

34:23.094 --> 34:25.157
Any luck?

34:25.157 --> 34:30.184
Well, the Charleston boat
was called The Philomela.

34:30.184 --> 34:33.589
But I can't find its page
in the ship registry.

34:33.589 --> 34:36.466
It should be here somewhere.

34:46.938 --> 34:48.570
Look.

34:48.570 --> 34:52.074
This shadow.
A page has been cut out.

34:52.074 --> 34:55.166
It's just cut really close to the spine.

34:55.166 --> 34:59.571
The only people allowed in here
are academics and historians.

35:06.377 --> 35:09.355
Well, I bet they let benefactors in.

35:14.065 --> 35:19.798
You were right. Simon Harper made
a $100,000 donation to the archives.

35:20.616 --> 35:22.517
The Philomela.

36:47.443 --> 36:48.904
Josiah.

36:48.904 --> 36:50.976
That rings a bell.

36:51.981 --> 36:56.698
Josiah Roundtree.
The Quaker turncoat.

36:56.698 --> 37:00.537
The roundtrees were a revered
New York Quaker family,

37:00.537 --> 37:03.232
till Josiah's greed got in the way.

37:03.232 --> 37:06.101
The furs and the horseshoes to Brazil,
that's just a cover.

37:06.101 --> 37:10.531
He was sending money to the south
to help keep slavery legal.

37:10.531 --> 37:15.300
So the coins in the boat
prove Josiah's guilt.

37:15.300 --> 37:19.572
Is Harper so desperate to erase
his ancestor's shame,

37:19.572 --> 37:21.343
he'd murder two people?

37:21.343 --> 37:24.929
Well, can you imagine him
having to explain this to his wife?

37:24.929 --> 37:28.510
That's why Harper doesn't
want to bring the coins up.

37:28.772 --> 37:31.461
There's something on that ship that's...

37:31.461 --> 37:35.031
that will cost him more than it's worth.

37:38.763 --> 37:40.683
How's he doing with his new baby?

37:40.683 --> 37:45.288
That might have been another cover.
His wife never checked into a hospital.

37:47.958 --> 37:49.992
Okay, well, that's good.

37:49.992 --> 37:53.529
We have time to tell Harper
that we're raising The Philomela.

38:08.086 --> 38:09.592
Mr. Harper!

38:10.186 --> 38:11.832
Good news.

38:11.832 --> 38:15.337
I think we found your wreckage.
Philomela.

38:15.337 --> 38:18.073
I got Captain Fox,
part of our scuba unit,

38:18.073 --> 38:19.507
on the other end of this thing.

38:19.507 --> 38:23.752
He says as soon as they ID this wreck,
they can start recovery.

38:27.855 --> 38:30.322
That's not my ship.
Mine is The Falkirk.

38:30.322 --> 38:32.650
No, don't you remember?

38:32.650 --> 38:36.628
The Philomela is the name of the boat
you looked for off Charleston.

38:36.628 --> 38:39.135
Turns out your divers found it here.

38:39.135 --> 38:40.764
It's yours.

38:40.764 --> 38:43.490
I don't want to pay for the recovery.
Leave it.

38:43.490 --> 38:44.867
- Captain!
- What do you mean?

38:44.867 --> 38:47.359
There could be tens of millions of dollars
of gold coins on that thing.

38:47.359 --> 38:49.505
- Captain.
- Why wouldn't you wanna claim that?

38:49.505 --> 38:50.577
Bring that boat back.

38:50.577 --> 38:52.033
I told you before,
I don't need the money.

38:52.033 --> 38:54.445
Ah, that's just the Quaker in you talking.

38:54.445 --> 38:56.966
My family hasn't been religious
for generations.

38:56.966 --> 38:58.769
Family? The Harpers?

38:58.769 --> 39:02.903
Your father, grandfather?
Or the Roundtrees, as in Josiah?

39:03.227 --> 39:06.012
- We're all the same family.
- Oh, hardly.

39:06.012 --> 39:10.308
The Roundtrees have lived in disgrace,
while the harpers, well...

39:10.308 --> 39:14.416
they've prospered.
Especially you.

39:14.639 --> 39:16.676
You're the only Harper of your generation.

39:16.676 --> 39:18.413
And the last.

39:18.413 --> 39:20.134
I want my son to have the Roundtree name.

39:20.134 --> 39:22.691
Well, that's why you hired Rick the first time.

39:22.691 --> 39:25.313
To prove there was no money
on the Philomela.

39:25.313 --> 39:29.240
To prove your great grandfather
Josiah wasn't a traitor.

39:29.240 --> 39:31.894
Very good, detective.
You figured it out.

39:31.894 --> 39:35.035
If you raise those coins,
you'll reopen the family wound.

39:35.035 --> 39:36.175
Now get me out of here.

39:36.175 --> 39:38.509
No, we think there's more to it than that.

39:38.509 --> 39:42.161
You know, when Rick told you
they found that treasure,

39:42.161 --> 39:46.391
I guess you realized that that money
would prove that Josiah...

39:46.391 --> 39:49.344
Josiah defrauded his father.

39:49.344 --> 39:53.242
Josiah got wiped out
in the stock market in 1861.

39:53.242 --> 39:57.815
His father amended his will,
gave the land to him instead of his brother.

39:57.815 --> 39:59.259
But Josiah lied.

39:59.259 --> 40:02.787
He didn't lose that money,
he put it on The Philomela.

40:02.787 --> 40:04.290
What, you were there?

40:04.290 --> 40:05.827
I didn't have to be.

40:05.827 --> 40:10.824
Wills are filed in surrogate court.
We found a handwritten codicil.

40:10.824 --> 40:17.017
Statute of Limitations on fraud doesn't run out
until three years after discovery.

40:17.988 --> 40:19.511
That boat comes up,

40:19.511 --> 40:23.262
the Roundtrees... they could be entitled
to your entire fortune.

40:23.262 --> 40:25.863
No wonder you panicked
when Rick called you.

40:25.863 --> 40:28.254
So you convinced Rick to take you
down to the wreck

40:28.254 --> 40:30.232
so you could see for yourself.

40:30.232 --> 40:33.837
And once you did, you were
prepared to get rid of him.

40:33.837 --> 40:34.951
You know, that was good work.

40:34.951 --> 40:38.728
Planting those photos on Rick's camera
and then on Chilly's computer.

40:38.728 --> 40:41.041
We found the transom,
it's The Philomela.

40:41.041 --> 40:42.722
Shall we start the recovery?

40:42.722 --> 40:44.664
Yeah, hand on a second.
Wait till my orders.

40:44.664 --> 40:47.804
What do you think, Mr. Harper,
you gonna tell us what happened?

40:48.692 --> 40:50.765
Or should we bring up
Josiah's blood money

40:50.765 --> 40:52.601
and prove that the Roundtrees
were defrauded?

40:52.601 --> 40:53.869
No.

40:54.398 --> 40:56.087
Don't.

40:57.510 --> 40:59.657
The family trust is my son's birthright.

40:59.657 --> 41:02.229
Yeah, if you erase history.
That's what you tried to do, right?

41:02.229 --> 41:03.550
With Rick.

41:03.731 --> 41:05.767
With Chilly.
Dana was next.

41:05.767 --> 41:08.766
These people are lowlifes.
Bums.

41:08.766 --> 41:11.513
Rick, he's been dead
to his family for years.

41:11.513 --> 41:12.981
And you think they chose that?

41:12.981 --> 41:15.644
A man with no parents, no kids.

41:15.644 --> 41:17.211
What is he?
Nothing.

41:17.211 --> 41:18.419
His life is wasted.

41:18.419 --> 41:21.683
Yeah, well, not everyone can get
these things that they want.

41:21.955 --> 41:24.634
To you, they're what,
just orphans, right?

41:24.634 --> 41:28.780
All unloved. You left them floating
like driftwood, right?

41:28.780 --> 41:31.260
Is that why you got rid of them
the way that you did?

41:31.260 --> 41:33.242
I was just protecting my family.

41:33.242 --> 41:35.074
Protecting your family?

41:35.074 --> 41:36.915
You should have seen
the greed in Rick's eyes.

41:36.915 --> 41:39.377
- And Chilly's.
- No one can protect their family.

41:39.377 --> 41:40.918
- Not even you.
- My wife and son deserve...

41:40.918 --> 41:43.560
Simon Harper, you are under arrest
for the murder of Tarek Agiza...

41:43.560 --> 41:45.293
You won't take it from them.

41:50.879 --> 41:53.470
Fish him out and cuff him.

41:58.680 --> 42:01.427
So... what happened?

42:01.427 --> 42:03.979
Harper slipped and fell.
