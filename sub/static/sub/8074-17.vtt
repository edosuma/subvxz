WEBVTT

00:09.843 --> 00:11.445
Well, I give up.

00:11.479 --> 00:13.281
Our insurance
company only gave us

00:13.314 --> 00:16.284
$100 to fix this water damage.

00:16.317 --> 00:18.452
I mean, I can't get anybody
to paint it for that.

00:18.486 --> 00:19.587
Come on, Leon,
there's got to be

00:19.620 --> 00:21.289
some interior
decorator out there

00:21.322 --> 00:23.624
that owes you a big favor.

00:23.657 --> 00:27.095
Oh, what a classy
comment, Roseanne.

00:27.128 --> 00:29.897
You know, it's a wonder that
you work here in a diner

00:29.930 --> 00:32.700
and not in the world of opera,
where they would appreciate

00:32.733 --> 00:35.503
a woman of your girth.

00:35.536 --> 00:38.339
Don't talk to me about class,
and it's pronounced "Op-rah."

00:46.280 --> 00:49.783
Listen, Stacy, I'm really
sorry about you breaking up

00:49.817 --> 00:50.984
with your boyfriend.

00:51.018 --> 00:53.287
I know how hard that is.

00:53.321 --> 00:55.823
I mean, you feel
alone, you feel empty,

00:55.856 --> 00:58.526
you feel like a
part of you died.

00:58.559 --> 01:01.495
So if there's anything
I can do to help--

01:01.529 --> 01:04.465
Can you lend me $40?

01:04.498 --> 01:06.467
Well, I've got 12.

01:10.704 --> 01:11.505
Whenever.

01:15.008 --> 01:16.977
You know, if we
don't get him neutered,

01:17.010 --> 01:19.046
he's going to end up
spraying everywhere.

01:22.049 --> 01:23.717
It's just, I think
it's disgusting

01:23.751 --> 01:27.087
the way that Stacy is taking
advantage of our David.

01:27.121 --> 01:28.322
You're right.

01:28.356 --> 01:30.057
If anybody is going to take
advantage of our David,

01:30.090 --> 01:31.259
it'll be me.

01:31.292 --> 01:33.194
David, come over here.

01:33.227 --> 01:35.028
Yeah, Mrs. Conner?

01:35.062 --> 01:36.797
Uh, you can't hang
around here anymore.

01:36.830 --> 01:37.698
I can't?

01:37.731 --> 01:39.066
No.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.734
We've got this painter coming
in to do this wall tomorrow.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.370
It's going to be
way too crowded.

01:42.403 --> 01:44.205
And it's going to take
that painter probably

01:44.238 --> 01:45.839
all day to fix that wall.

01:45.873 --> 01:47.575
And then, he'll
probably stretch it out

01:47.608 --> 01:50.010
so he can just stand
there and stare at Stacy.

01:53.447 --> 01:56.484
Hey, what if I painted
the wall for you?

01:56.517 --> 01:59.787
You?
Well, that's right.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.855
You do paint.

02:01.889 --> 02:04.558
But I couldn't take advantage
of you like that, David.

02:04.592 --> 02:06.827
I've only got $20 to work with.

02:06.860 --> 02:08.829
No, I could do a mural.

02:08.862 --> 02:11.031
I mean, it would be a
great opportunity for me.

02:11.064 --> 02:13.201
I would feel like I was
taking advantage of you.

02:13.234 --> 02:16.337
Well, I wouldn't want
you to feel bad, David.

02:16.370 --> 02:17.505
I'll tell you what.

02:17.538 --> 02:19.039
I won't pay anything.

02:19.072 --> 02:20.308
OK.

02:20.341 --> 02:21.141
And bring your own paint.

02:23.777 --> 02:26.714
Could you help
me with my math?

02:26.747 --> 02:28.616
I'm not good at math.

02:28.649 --> 02:31.185
I don't care.

02:31.219 --> 02:33.654
Get out of here.

02:33.687 --> 02:35.223
Break's over, Stacy.

02:35.256 --> 02:39.227
Those dishes have been on
table three for an hour.

02:39.260 --> 02:41.362
Could someone else
clean that table?

02:41.395 --> 02:42.263
I can't.

02:42.296 --> 02:43.997
Why not?

02:44.031 --> 02:46.066
Because that's me
and Billy's table.

02:46.099 --> 02:48.035
It brings back
too many memories.

02:48.068 --> 02:51.305
I never saw the two
of you sitting there.

02:51.339 --> 02:52.406
Well, we didn't.

02:52.440 --> 02:54.275
Well, then, how can
you call it our table?

02:54.308 --> 02:55.776
I mean, if you didn't
even eat dinner there,

02:55.809 --> 02:57.778
what else could you--

02:57.811 --> 03:01.782
oh, my god, you had sex on it?

03:01.815 --> 03:03.517
Is that a problem?

03:03.551 --> 03:04.418
No.

03:04.452 --> 03:05.253
It's no problem.

03:07.488 --> 03:10.291
I've got to go talk to Roseanne.

03:10.324 --> 03:11.259
This isn't about you.

03:15.729 --> 03:17.931
Stacy had sex on
one of our tables.

03:17.965 --> 03:20.568
God, I hope they
left her a good tip.

03:20.601 --> 03:22.570
That's not funny.
I find it disgusting.

03:22.603 --> 03:23.971
I want to fire her.

03:24.004 --> 03:28.409
Well, I want to keep her and
install some security cameras.

03:28.442 --> 03:29.843
You think it's OK?

03:29.877 --> 03:31.245
Yeah.

03:31.279 --> 03:34.948
Don't be such a hypocrite after
all the places you've done it.

03:34.982 --> 03:37.551
I'd never do
something like that!

03:37.585 --> 03:38.986
You're jealous.

03:39.019 --> 03:44.124
I'm not jealous of that
slutty, trampy mother of ours.

03:44.157 --> 03:46.960
I like Mom.

03:46.994 --> 03:49.763
I really can't
clean table three.

03:49.797 --> 03:52.132
Could someone else please do it?

03:52.165 --> 03:53.534
OK, I'll do it.

03:53.567 --> 03:56.637
Just do me a favor and finish
cleaning up this ice machine.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.472
I can't clean that either.

04:04.044 --> 04:07.415
[theme music]

04:55.463 --> 04:56.330
Hi, Mark.

04:56.364 --> 04:57.698
Hey.

04:57.731 --> 05:00.534
Listen, do you think I could
watch you work on the pipes?

05:00.568 --> 05:03.871
I mean, I love to
watch guys fix things.

05:03.904 --> 05:05.205
You do, huh?

05:05.238 --> 05:07.708
That's, uh, pretty mental.

05:07.741 --> 05:10.644
[laughter] You're so funny.

05:10.678 --> 05:11.579
Do you want a coffee?

05:11.612 --> 05:12.713
Nah.

05:12.746 --> 05:13.547
OK.

05:17.250 --> 05:18.619
What the hell are you doing?

05:18.652 --> 05:19.520
What?

05:19.553 --> 05:20.688
You're a married man.

05:20.721 --> 05:22.890
You shouldn't be
coming on to Stacy.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.692
I'm not coming on to her.
She's coming on to me.

05:24.725 --> 05:26.694
Come on.
That doesn't even make sense.

05:26.727 --> 05:28.295
I'm the one who's available.

05:28.328 --> 05:31.599
Why would she want
you and not me?

05:31.632 --> 05:32.600
Hmm.

05:32.633 --> 05:34.535
I don't know, Mr.
Size-Seven-Shoes.

05:40.608 --> 05:41.475
Leon?

05:41.509 --> 05:42.309
Mm-hmm.

05:44.878 --> 05:46.246
Can I ask you a
question about women?

05:51.585 --> 05:53.854
Well, it's a bit like
asking Mrs. Conner about

05:53.887 --> 05:59.827
low-cal desserts, but go ahead.

05:59.860 --> 06:02.095
I was wondering.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.665
I was wondering what
they like in a guy.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.467
You know, since
you like guys, so--

06:09.236 --> 06:12.773
This is offensive, isn't it?

06:12.806 --> 06:17.545
Actually, it's
surprisingly interesting.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.947
Well, it's just--

06:19.980 --> 06:22.416
is Mark better looking than me?

06:22.450 --> 06:23.884
Come on, David.

06:23.917 --> 06:26.987
I mean, that's like
trying to compare apples

06:27.020 --> 06:31.124
and-- what do they call those
dinky little tiny oranges?

06:31.158 --> 06:32.726
Cumquats.

06:32.760 --> 06:36.163
Everyone loves cumquats.

06:36.196 --> 06:38.566
I think Stacy likes apples.

06:38.599 --> 06:39.733
Oh, don't worry
about it, David.

06:39.767 --> 06:43.036
You know, when I was
a kid about your age,

06:43.070 --> 06:45.038
I wasn't very popular
with the girls either.

06:45.072 --> 06:47.140
And things worked
out great for me.

06:50.544 --> 06:53.146
But you're gay.

06:53.180 --> 06:53.981
Best of luck to you.

07:01.188 --> 07:02.289
Hey, Stacy.

07:02.322 --> 07:07.895
I was wondering, could
I paint you in my mural?

07:07.928 --> 07:09.429
Wow, really?

07:09.463 --> 07:10.698
Yeah.

07:10.731 --> 07:12.833
That's why I've been, kind
of, staring at you a lot,

07:12.866 --> 07:13.967
not because I'm some creep.

07:17.204 --> 07:18.839
Hey, Mark, guess what?

07:18.872 --> 07:20.407
David's going to put
me in his picture.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.944
This is going to be so much fun.

07:23.977 --> 07:26.747
Boy, Mark, I bet you wish you
had used those crayons for more

07:26.780 --> 07:27.815
than just stabbing people.

07:31.418 --> 07:33.754
You still want to
watch me fix that pipe?

07:33.787 --> 07:34.922
- Sure.
- All right.

07:34.955 --> 07:35.756
Let's go.

07:38.158 --> 07:39.326
Hey, hey.

07:39.359 --> 07:40.360
What are you doing?

07:40.393 --> 07:41.695
Just proving a point.

07:41.729 --> 07:44.131
Why don't you get back to your
painting there, Fembrandt?

07:55.809 --> 07:58.345
Jackie, honey, you OK?

07:58.378 --> 08:01.014
Do we have to go
to the Lobo tonight?

08:01.048 --> 08:03.183
Can't we do something different?

08:03.216 --> 08:04.084
Like what?

08:04.117 --> 08:06.186
I don't know, man.

08:06.219 --> 08:07.655
I just want to go.

08:07.688 --> 08:10.758
I just want to go so far
I've got to come back

08:10.791 --> 08:12.259
just to see where I came from.

08:12.292 --> 08:15.095
Are you with me?

08:15.128 --> 08:17.565
As long as we're back home to
relieve the babysitter by 9:00.

08:17.598 --> 08:20.067
Oh, yeah, you're right.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.201
Fred, I'm just being silly.

08:25.472 --> 08:29.509
Honey, pull the car over.

08:29.543 --> 08:30.443
Why?

08:30.477 --> 08:31.444
You getting carsick?

08:31.478 --> 08:33.446
No.

08:33.480 --> 08:35.148
You know.

08:35.182 --> 08:35.983
Pull over.

08:40.087 --> 08:41.622
You know.
- Oh!

08:41.655 --> 08:42.522
What?

08:42.556 --> 08:43.724
In the car?

08:43.757 --> 08:44.625
You're crazy!

08:44.658 --> 08:45.793
Come on, Fred, it'll be fun.

08:45.826 --> 08:47.094
It'll be just like high school.

08:47.127 --> 08:50.964
I'll even let you
brag to your friends.

08:50.998 --> 08:52.566
Jackie, if you
wanted to have sex,

08:52.600 --> 08:56.369
you should have thought about
that before we left the house.

08:56.403 --> 08:57.805
I didn't want to have it then.

08:57.838 --> 08:58.906
Fine.

08:58.939 --> 09:00.774
I'll turn the car
around, we'll drive back

09:00.808 --> 09:04.077
to our home in our
comfortable bed, have the sex,

09:04.111 --> 09:05.412
and then go to the bar.

09:05.445 --> 09:07.114
I don't want to have
the sex in the bed.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.749
There are six rooms
in that house.

09:08.782 --> 09:11.852
The only room we have the
sex in is the bedroom.

09:11.885 --> 09:12.953
Yeah.

09:12.986 --> 09:15.689
And the only room we
cook in is the kitchen.

09:15.723 --> 09:16.590
Sometimes we barbecue.

09:19.326 --> 09:21.094
I'm really sorry, but
I just don't get it.

09:21.128 --> 09:23.964
I don't see anything good about
having sex in a cramped car.

09:23.997 --> 09:26.299
It's not just the sex.

09:26.333 --> 09:30.103
Fred, our whole
lives are boring.

09:30.137 --> 09:32.105
You're boring.

09:32.139 --> 09:33.306
Why?

09:33.340 --> 09:35.408
Because I don't want to
get an ashtray in my butt?

09:38.145 --> 09:40.714
Every single Thursday
night, we drive to happy hour,

09:40.748 --> 09:43.016
and every single time,
you take Kenter to Raleigh

09:43.050 --> 09:44.151
and a right on Radford.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.253
You don't take Sycamore
because of the potholes.

09:46.286 --> 09:47.821
OK.
I'm sorry.

09:47.855 --> 09:48.656
You're right.

09:52.626 --> 09:54.094
We'll take Sycamore.

09:58.465 --> 09:59.299
Woo-hoo!

09:59.332 --> 10:00.133
That's living.

10:13.013 --> 10:14.381
Hey, Dan, where's Roseanne?

10:14.414 --> 10:16.684
Oh, she was feeling
a little nauseous,

10:16.717 --> 10:18.852
so she filled her purse with
chicken wings and went on home.

10:21.521 --> 10:23.290
Great, well, I'm
glad I came then.

10:23.323 --> 10:25.025
While you two play pool,
I can sit at the bar

10:25.058 --> 10:26.526
and have a drink.

10:26.559 --> 10:27.795
That's what bars are for.

10:27.828 --> 10:31.464
Bars are for drinking, and
kitchens are for cooking,

10:31.498 --> 10:34.768
and cars are for driving.

10:34.802 --> 10:36.069
That's God's plan.

10:36.103 --> 10:37.570
You can either stick with
that or you can go to hell.

10:41.408 --> 10:42.542
Grouchy, party of one.

10:45.545 --> 10:48.581
We're having a few problems.

10:48.615 --> 10:49.783
Yup.

10:49.817 --> 10:51.952
Should've married yourself
a quiet, easy-going gal

10:51.985 --> 10:53.353
like I did.

10:53.386 --> 10:54.855
We're driving over here.

10:54.888 --> 10:56.223
All of a sudden,
out of nowhere, she

10:56.256 --> 10:58.892
starts blaming me for her life.

10:58.926 --> 11:00.660
She says it's lousy
and predictable.

11:00.694 --> 11:02.562
And get this-- boring.

11:02.595 --> 11:06.599
Ah, women-- they just
can't say they're happy.

11:06.633 --> 11:08.368
It's got me worried, Dan.

11:08.401 --> 11:12.039
It all started with this thing.

11:12.072 --> 11:12.873
What kind of thing?

11:15.575 --> 11:17.377
This weird sex thing.

11:20.814 --> 11:21.681
Chicken wing?

11:25.118 --> 11:27.620
I don't even know how to
begin to talk about this.

11:27.654 --> 11:30.657
I mean, this woman is
the mother of my child.

11:30.690 --> 11:33.126
There's hot sauce.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.796
Hey, I am all for having
some fun in the bedroom,

11:35.829 --> 11:37.597
but what she's
talking about is--

11:37.630 --> 11:39.666
it's bizarre.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.268
Boy, these must come
off tiny chickens.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.573
Dan, is this making
you uncomfortable?

11:46.606 --> 11:48.508
No, no.

11:48.541 --> 11:51.511
Speaking in front of a group
makes me uncomfortable.

11:51.544 --> 11:54.915
Listening to your and Jackie's
sex life makes me wish I were

11:54.948 --> 11:55.849
speaking in front of a group.

11:57.818 --> 11:58.685
OK.

11:58.718 --> 11:59.586
Forget it.

11:59.619 --> 12:02.022
No, I'm sorry.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.523
OK.

12:03.556 --> 12:04.424
What does she want you to do?

12:07.928 --> 12:12.065
She wanted us to
have sex in the car.

12:17.704 --> 12:21.241
She wanted to have sex
with her husband in the car?

12:21.274 --> 12:22.375
God, it's freaky.

12:22.409 --> 12:26.446
Someone like that living
right here in Lanford.

12:26.479 --> 12:28.048
You're making fun of me, Dan.

12:28.081 --> 12:31.018
No, it's just, if
your wife isn't happy,

12:31.051 --> 12:32.585
you can do something about it.

12:32.619 --> 12:34.855
Hey, I thought our
sex life was great.

12:34.888 --> 12:37.024
But apparently, she thinks
we're in some kind of a rut.

12:37.057 --> 12:38.025
Well, you are in a rut.

12:38.058 --> 12:39.026
We are not!

12:39.059 --> 12:40.093
Of course you are!

12:40.127 --> 12:41.394
That's why you're happy.

12:41.428 --> 12:44.531
Guys love being in a rut,
but women think it's boring.

12:44.564 --> 12:46.766
The trick is to keep
them from getting too

12:46.800 --> 12:48.335
bored before they leave you.

12:48.368 --> 12:52.105
Then, there goes your
nice, comfortable ride.

12:52.139 --> 12:55.943
But I don't want to
have sex in the car!

12:55.976 --> 12:59.913
Women like to try new things.

12:59.947 --> 13:02.249
If you love your wife,
you've got to give a little.

13:04.952 --> 13:07.988
I suppose doing it in the
car is not going to kill me.

13:08.021 --> 13:09.356
Not if you put
your flashers on.

13:13.060 --> 13:17.397
Dan, do you ever have sex
with Roseanne in your car?

13:17.430 --> 13:19.366
Oh, Fred, I've had sex
with Roseanne in your car.

13:23.270 --> 13:24.337
That's how much I love my wife.

13:29.676 --> 13:32.045
So we just left
on his motorcycle.

13:32.079 --> 13:34.114
I don't know why I always
end up dating jerks who

13:34.147 --> 13:35.949
just care about acting tough.

13:35.983 --> 13:39.019
I just wind up getting burned.

13:39.052 --> 13:41.221
Well, maybe you
should start dating,

13:41.254 --> 13:43.223
you know, more
sensitive guys, guys

13:43.256 --> 13:45.758
who aren't afraid of
showing their emotions.

13:50.230 --> 13:53.566
Oh, god, I said I
wouldn't do this.

13:53.600 --> 13:54.534
Yeah.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.203
You're right.

13:56.236 --> 13:58.038
But guys like that--
they just wind up feeling

13:58.071 --> 14:00.473
like my brother or my sister.

14:03.643 --> 14:05.412
Yeah.

14:05.445 --> 14:08.181
Boy, those wussy boys
just make me sick.

14:13.386 --> 14:15.322
Hey, listen, I've
got an extra ticket

14:15.355 --> 14:16.489
to The Dead concert tonight.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.191
The chick I was going to
go with had to cancel,

14:18.225 --> 14:19.927
because she had this--

14:19.960 --> 14:22.996
she had a baby.

14:23.030 --> 14:24.264
Are you kidding?

14:24.297 --> 14:25.598
That would be great!

14:25.632 --> 14:27.434
But it gets really
hot in the stadium.

14:27.467 --> 14:28.936
What do you think I
should wear tonight?

14:28.969 --> 14:29.836
I don't care, man.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.604
Wear whatever you want.

14:31.638 --> 14:32.705
I'll be wearing a tube top.

14:35.442 --> 14:37.177
Hey, Mark, guess what?

14:37.210 --> 14:39.679
David's going to take
me The Dead show later.

14:39.712 --> 14:40.580
Oh, yeah?

14:40.613 --> 14:41.514
He must like you.

14:41.548 --> 14:44.451
"Dr. Quinn" is on tonight.

14:44.484 --> 14:45.452
Hey.

14:45.485 --> 14:48.355
Hey, Dan-a-roo,
what's the good word?

14:48.388 --> 14:50.757
Well, it's not Dan-a-roo.

14:50.790 --> 14:53.560
David, this came
for you in the mail.

14:53.593 --> 14:55.028
Oh, it's my SAT scores.

14:55.062 --> 14:56.129
How come they're already open?

14:56.163 --> 14:58.031
Oh, Mrs. Conner made
an honest mistake.

14:58.065 --> 15:00.900
She forgot to reseal it.

15:00.934 --> 15:02.602
How'd you do?

15:02.635 --> 15:04.004
He did great!

15:04.037 --> 15:08.575
Spelling, deciphering, he done
whomped all they threw at him.

15:08.608 --> 15:09.642
Well, not great.

15:09.676 --> 15:10.610
But yeah, I did pretty good.

15:10.643 --> 15:12.845
Ah, don't be so modest.

15:12.879 --> 15:14.914
What's the capital of Montana?

15:14.948 --> 15:16.916
- Uh, Helena?
- It probably is!

15:19.953 --> 15:21.521
Hey, Dan, you know,
I've got that sink

15:21.554 --> 15:22.855
practically done in there.

15:22.889 --> 15:24.324
I was able to save a
lot more of that copper

15:24.357 --> 15:26.126
tubing than you thought.

15:26.159 --> 15:27.894
That's great.

15:27.927 --> 15:31.064
$0.60 a foot-- you
just made us $0.08.

15:31.098 --> 15:32.699
See yous later, egghead.

15:38.338 --> 15:40.473
Oh, come on.
Don't let it bother you, Mark.

15:40.507 --> 15:42.909
He was just all excited
about my test scores.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.611
By tomorrow, he'll
remember that I mostly

15:44.644 --> 15:47.480
just make him uncomfortable.

15:47.514 --> 15:48.648
Hey, Stacy, you
know, if you want

15:48.681 --> 15:50.583
me to help you with
your car, tonight's

15:50.617 --> 15:52.319
the only night I have free.

15:52.352 --> 15:54.687
But I'm going to
The Dead show tonight.

15:54.721 --> 15:57.657
Well, take it or leave it.

15:57.690 --> 15:58.992
Oh, all right.

15:59.026 --> 16:01.228
I mean, I really need
to get my car fixed.

16:01.261 --> 16:02.462
Sorry, David.

16:02.495 --> 16:05.465
Oh, hey, if you want
to pick up some beer,

16:05.498 --> 16:07.134
I'll hang out afterwards.

16:07.167 --> 16:07.967
OK.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.573
What the hell are you doing?

16:13.606 --> 16:15.442
Why do you have to
ruin this for me?

16:15.475 --> 16:17.677
It's not my fault she likes
me more than she likes you.

16:17.710 --> 16:19.079
Oh, don't give me that.

16:19.112 --> 16:20.947
You just can't stand it that I
was getting somewhere with her.

16:20.980 --> 16:24.984
Oh, you were just
closing in on a handshake.

16:25.018 --> 16:26.886
God, Mark, how
evil can you be?

16:26.919 --> 16:28.021
Fine, I'll ask you nicely.

16:28.055 --> 16:29.989
I really like Stacy.

16:30.023 --> 16:31.358
OK?

16:31.391 --> 16:35.062
Now, could you please, please,
as a brother, just back off

16:35.095 --> 16:36.996
and give me a chance?

16:37.030 --> 16:37.830
No.

16:40.933 --> 16:42.369
Why are you such a bastard?

16:42.402 --> 16:43.436
I'll tell you what.

16:43.470 --> 16:47.674
I might leave her alone
if you cry for me.

16:47.707 --> 16:48.508
Hey.

16:50.910 --> 16:51.778
Hey!

16:51.811 --> 16:54.281
What's going on?

16:54.314 --> 16:55.915
- Nothing.
- No, come on, Mark.

16:55.948 --> 16:57.617
Why don't you tell her
what we're fighting about?

16:57.650 --> 16:59.152
It's nothing.

16:59.186 --> 17:00.053
Yeah.

17:00.087 --> 17:00.887
What did you want?

17:03.723 --> 17:05.958
I came by to ask if you
want to go to a movie tonight.

17:05.992 --> 17:07.260
Hey, that's a good idea.

17:07.294 --> 17:11.064
Why don't you go to a movie
tonight with your wife?

17:11.098 --> 17:12.165
I can't.

17:12.199 --> 17:13.333
I'm busy.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.901
- Busy doing what?
- What?

17:14.934 --> 17:16.136
I don't know.

17:16.169 --> 17:18.037
What, I have to tell you
what I'm doing every second?

17:18.071 --> 17:19.005
What is the big deal?

17:19.038 --> 17:20.707
Why are you acting like this?

17:20.740 --> 17:22.442
It's not a big deal.

17:22.475 --> 17:24.544
I just have to fix a car.

17:24.577 --> 17:25.445
OK.

17:25.478 --> 17:26.979
Whose car?

17:27.013 --> 17:28.815
Whose?
You know, it's--

17:33.520 --> 17:36.356
What's going on, Mark?

17:36.389 --> 17:37.857
It's my car.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.659
Actually, it's a car I'm
thinking about buying.

17:39.692 --> 17:41.561
Mark said he'd come down
and take a look at it.

17:41.594 --> 17:43.796
Oh, well, why didn't
you just say so?

17:43.830 --> 17:45.398
Why does it have
to be so difficult?

17:45.432 --> 17:46.999
I'm sorry.

17:47.033 --> 17:47.934
OK.

17:47.967 --> 17:49.136
I guess I'll see
you at home then.

17:49.169 --> 17:49.936
Bye.

17:54.407 --> 17:58.978
Hey, look, when it comes to
my life, I don't need your help.

17:59.011 --> 18:00.847
No, I think you do.

18:00.880 --> 18:03.716
I can't believe you are risking
your marriage just to hurt me.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.285
Are you really that
jealous of me, Mark?

18:05.318 --> 18:07.454
No, I ain't jealous of
nobody, especially you.

18:07.487 --> 18:09.055
Oh, come on, let's face it.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.658
Mr. Conner is proud of me for
something you could never do.

18:11.691 --> 18:12.892
Oh, what?

18:12.925 --> 18:14.327
Walk under a table
without ducking?

18:17.730 --> 18:19.065
Fine.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.134
Put me down, take a girl away
from me-- whatever it takes

18:21.168 --> 18:22.935
to make you feel superior.

18:22.969 --> 18:24.204
Just remember one thing, Mark.

18:24.237 --> 18:26.306
Besides Becky, I'm the
only person around here

18:26.339 --> 18:27.640
that gives a crap about you.

18:34.214 --> 18:35.748
Hey.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.083
Hey.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.818
So what time are you going
to come by to fix my car?

18:42.422 --> 18:44.357
I can't do it.

18:44.391 --> 18:45.725
You should go to the concert.

19:00.072 --> 19:01.608
JACKIE: I still don't
see why you couldn't just

19:01.641 --> 19:04.344
get your wallet in the morning.

19:04.377 --> 19:11.017
Actually, honey, that's
not why I brought you here.

19:11.050 --> 19:11.918
Oh, god.

19:11.951 --> 19:13.052
Oh, Fred!

19:13.085 --> 19:18.958
Oh, god, let's do it
some place bad, real bad.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.993
Tables are bad.

19:21.027 --> 19:22.695
Don't I know it!

19:22.729 --> 19:25.598
Can't wait to get up on
top of this table and--

19:25.632 --> 19:26.899
it's not too sturdy.

19:26.933 --> 19:28.468
How about the counter?

19:28.501 --> 19:31.504
The counter-- the
counter is better!

19:31.538 --> 19:34.441
Oh, you get served
quicker there.

19:34.474 --> 19:36.643
Do you need to see a menu or do
you already know what you want?

19:40.179 --> 19:42.114
[laughter]

19:42.148 --> 19:43.850
What?

19:43.883 --> 19:45.017
It's, kind of, dirty.

19:45.051 --> 19:47.487
It's OK, though,
because you know,

19:47.520 --> 19:50.056
sex is supposed to be dirty.

19:50.089 --> 19:55.695
[laughing and squealing]

19:55.728 --> 19:58.765
You sure there's not, like,
a cot in here or something?

19:58.798 --> 20:01.200
Fred, I know you're,
kind of, tense about this,

20:01.234 --> 20:02.635
but you just have
to try and relax.

20:02.669 --> 20:05.305
Because it's supposed
to be a fantasy.

20:05.338 --> 20:08.441
You tell me what you want to do.

20:08.475 --> 20:09.776
Oh, you don't want
to know my fantasy.

20:09.809 --> 20:11.311
Fred, I'm your wife.

20:11.344 --> 20:13.513
We really should talk
about this stuff.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.348
- You're just going to get mad.
- No, I won't, Fred.

20:15.382 --> 20:16.449
I swear to you.

20:16.483 --> 20:17.450
Whatever it is, I'm
not going to judge you.

20:20.387 --> 20:24.291
Well, my fantasies are
you and me at home in bed.

20:24.324 --> 20:26.426
Really?

20:26.459 --> 20:27.427
Doing what?

20:32.532 --> 20:33.666
What we always do.

20:38.305 --> 20:40.172
I'm sorry, Jackie, but
that's what I like.

20:44.143 --> 20:46.479
Let's go home, Fred.

20:46.513 --> 20:47.380
You don't mind, do you?

20:47.414 --> 20:48.681
No, I don't, no, not at all.

20:48.715 --> 20:53.085
You tried and that's
the important thing.

20:53.119 --> 20:53.920
Thanks.

21:13.673 --> 21:16.108
[door shuts]

21:17.276 --> 21:19.912
Oh, man, I thought
they'd never leave.

21:19.946 --> 21:25.485
Oh, you know, baby, I really
missed you since we broke up.

21:25.518 --> 21:29.356
Hey, let's go do
it on our table.

21:29.389 --> 21:30.990
You know, I got a better idea.

21:38.398 --> 21:42.168
Have you seen the
new ice machine?
