Happy New Year.

02:19.280 --> 02:22.636
- We'll come to hear you sing tonight.
- Already going to join the others?

02:23.280 --> 02:24.952
Lots of people around now.

Screenwriter & Director: Jia Zhangke

<i>We're seeing off the cold winter</i>

02:56.600 --> 03:00.229
<i>and greeting the final spring of
the 20th century.</i>

03:00.680 --> 03:02.432
<i>Our first steps on the journey</i>

03:02.600 --> 03:06.513
<i>to welcome the 21st century's
new dawn!</i>

03:06.680 --> 03:10.309
<i>See spring's first footsteps!</i>

03:10.680 --> 03:13.911
<i>The Fenyang Spring Festival Gala
starts here!</i>

03:14.080 --> 03:15.911
<i>And now...</i>

03:16.080 --> 03:17.911
<i>Please enjoy</i>

03:18.080 --> 03:19.752
<i>the Yangge Umbrella!</i>

03:20.080 --> 03:22.116
I wish my cheekbones

03:22.360 --> 03:23.873
were smaller.

03:24.680 --> 03:26.432
You study yourself closely.

03:26.640 --> 03:27.470
Right.

03:28.080 --> 03:30.196
When will you start studying me?

03:31.080 --> 03:33.435
Study you? Are you a problem?

03:33.960 --> 03:36.394
A geometry problem or
a algebra problem?

03:36.560 --> 03:38.198
Either way, a problem.

03:40.240 --> 03:41.673
Studying takes time.

03:56.720 --> 03:59.109
Boss Zhang, you made it.

03:59.280 --> 04:00.554
Yeah, I got here.

04:00.760 --> 04:02.910
- Where have you come from, Jinsheng?
- Taiyuan.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.912
I hear your coal mine's doing
well this year.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.116
Our boss is desperate with
the low price of coal.

04:09.720 --> 04:12.393
When it bottoms out, I'll buy it.

04:13.360 --> 04:14.873
I bet you will.

04:15.160 --> 04:17.390
How's your gas station doing
this year?

04:18.600 --> 04:21.637
Okay... We're too busy bundling up
all the cash.

04:22.800 --> 04:23.915
Great!

04:24.080 --> 04:25.752
No false modesty, then!

04:34.080 --> 04:36.435
Gotta go...
We should do lunch sometime.

04:36.600 --> 04:39.319
Why did you bother to come?

04:46.880 --> 04:48.393
I thought you were leaving?

04:51.600 --> 04:53.318
Won't you see me off?

04:58.480 --> 04:59.879
Won't you?

05:00.560 --> 05:01.788
What is wrong?

05:01.960 --> 05:03.757
Are you serious?
Getting rich has gone

05:03.920 --> 05:06.878
- to your head.
- Won't you?

05:09.320 --> 05:09.911
Come on...

05:12.600 --> 05:14.795
<i>Not a care in the world!</i>

05:15.000 --> 05:16.638
Look, that's my car.

05:19.280 --> 05:20.429
It's red!

05:21.080 --> 05:23.640
- You're showing off!
- How could I?

05:24.000 --> 05:24.955
Looks good.

05:36.960 --> 05:38.996
Pretty damn cool!

05:39.600 --> 05:41.795
Just right for the new century!

05:42.560 --> 05:45.313
Take us for a spin sometime?

05:45.480 --> 05:46.469
Sure!

05:48.360 --> 05:50.794
Hong Kong has the best views...

05:50.960 --> 05:52.313
Hong Kong hell,

05:52.480 --> 05:55.040
I'll drive you to America!

05:55.200 --> 05:56.679
Spend some dollars!

05:57.120 --> 06:00.556
You have to cross the Pacific
to get there.

06:01.120 --> 06:02.235
My geography was never great...

06:02.400 --> 06:06.154
I need you to tutor me.

06:06.320 --> 06:09.312
Forget America.
Macau returns to China very soon.

06:09.480 --> 06:10.833
Just take us to Macau...

06:11.000 --> 06:12.433
- Okay, Liangzi?
- Fine by me.

06:13.280 --> 06:16.431
You bet! It will be on me.

06:22.400 --> 06:23.594
Take it easy.

07:16.760 --> 07:19.797
Doing great, Erxiao!

07:26.680 --> 07:27.795
Hey, Xiao Yue!

08:02.600 --> 08:05.398
<i>Our hometown is Fenyang,</i>

08:05.560 --> 08:08.358
<i>by Dragon's Gate</i>

08:08.520 --> 08:11.159
<i>Famed for our mountains</i>

08:11.320 --> 08:13.834
<i>and rivers</i>

08:14.000 --> 08:16.389
<i>A purple haze rises</i>

08:16.560 --> 08:19.028
<i>from Wenfeng pagoda</i>

08:19.360 --> 08:21.351
<i>We step proudly</i>

08:21.640 --> 08:23.790
<i>into the new century!</i>

09:07.040 --> 09:09.110
<i>A purple haze rises</i>

09:09.280 --> 09:11.589
<i>from Wenfeng pagoda</i>

09:11.760 --> 09:13.796
<i>We step proudly</i>

09:13.960 --> 09:16.474
<i>into the new century!</i>

09:30.400 --> 09:32.914
Left foot of the clutch...

09:33.080 --> 09:34.798
Right foot slowly on the gas.

09:34.960 --> 09:36.712
On the gas!

09:36.880 --> 09:37.915
Change gear!

09:38.080 --> 09:39.718
Don't yell! You  scare me!

09:39.880 --> 09:41.677
Look forwards!

09:43.040 --> 09:45.031
Turn... Turn left.

09:47.440 --> 09:49.715
Turn... Slowly.

09:50.760 --> 09:52.352
Turn right.

09:52.720 --> 09:54.153
Turn right!

09:54.360 --> 09:56.749
- I can manage!
- Turn left!

10:01.760 --> 10:02.988
You're insured, right?

10:07.240 --> 10:09.435
<b>Yellow River, Ninth Cove</b>

10:13.800 --> 10:15.233
I'm so sorry.

10:17.120 --> 10:18.951
Sorry... I'm terribly sorry.

10:19.120 --> 10:21.759
Never mind, I can deal with it.

10:21.920 --> 10:24.559
- You must be upset.
- I told you, it's nothing.

10:24.720 --> 10:26.597
You can rely on German technology.

10:28.920 --> 10:29.830
It's okay?

10:30.520 --> 10:31.589
Okay.

10:33.560 --> 10:34.549
Are you sure?

10:34.960 --> 10:36.871
Yes, it's German technology.

10:38.080 --> 10:39.718
But you have a Chinese body.

10:42.440 --> 10:44.317
Will the car still go?
Can we get back?

10:44.480 --> 10:46.038
- If not you can push it!
- No problem.

10:46.200 --> 10:47.633
Come on, let's make some noise.

10:51.120 --> 10:51.996
Okay.

10:52.240 --> 10:53.070
Let's do it.

11:34.240 --> 11:35.116
Tao...

11:36.240 --> 11:39.152
Let's do without Liangzi next time.

11:41.400 --> 11:42.594
What do you mean?

11:44.920 --> 11:46.069
Isn't two nicer

11:46.800 --> 11:47.949
than three?

11:52.240 --> 11:53.673
You're being small-minded.

11:54.520 --> 11:56.795
It has nothing to do with that.

12:00.360 --> 12:04.433
Then what?
Is it a geometry problem? Or algebra?

12:09.680 --> 12:10.829
It's a triangle problem.

12:11.880 --> 12:15.668
Isn't a triangle more stable?
What did you learn in middle school?

12:16.280 --> 12:20.193
I graduated in law from Shanxi
University! By correspondence course.

12:28.560 --> 12:30.152
So talented!

12:31.160 --> 12:33.674
They didn't want you for
a higher degree?

12:34.640 --> 12:35.675
They underestimated me.

12:36.720 --> 12:38.039
Such self confidence!

13:35.720 --> 13:36.789
Sanming...

13:47.560 --> 13:49.516
Have a quick bath and
come back for a drink.

13:50.440 --> 13:53.910
I've brought some braised pork
from home.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.349
Great! Then don't hang around.

14:06.400 --> 14:08.868
- Busy, Liangzi?
- Jinsheng! What brings you here?

14:09.040 --> 14:10.632
Business.

14:13.960 --> 14:16.076
I've just bought this coalmine.

14:16.840 --> 14:18.273
Can it make a profit?

14:19.480 --> 14:20.913
The price of coal is so low.

14:21.080 --> 14:24.675
You don't get it,
it cost me next to nothing.

14:26.600 --> 14:29.239
Help me run the place.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.353
Don't just run the helmet store.

14:35.160 --> 14:38.357
You deserve better, no prospects here.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.395
Liangzi...

14:44.440 --> 14:46.032
What are we going to do?

14:46.800 --> 14:48.153
About what?

14:50.160 --> 14:51.559
I like Tao too.

14:53.360 --> 14:54.952
Then tell her so yourself.

14:57.680 --> 14:59.193
I'll make it plain...

15:01.160 --> 15:02.991
Just stay away from her.

15:04.200 --> 15:05.349
You have no chance with her.

15:13.400 --> 15:16.312
Let's see what an elite face
looks like.

15:18.840 --> 15:20.956
I'm telling you this as a friend.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.115
Piss off.

15:31.400 --> 15:32.355
Okay...

15:33.680 --> 15:37.116
From now on, our friendship is over.

15:38.440 --> 15:40.874
And you'd better get the
fuck out of my mine

15:42.840 --> 15:43.875
Don't you worry.

15:44.040 --> 15:47.555
The day I beg you for a living,
I'll be dead.

15:49.520 --> 15:50.475
I see.

15:51.360 --> 15:52.918
You've got balls.

16:28.480 --> 16:29.993
Take care of yourself.

16:43.360 --> 16:45.590
- Hello.
- Hey, Liangzi.

16:46.440 --> 16:48.396
- How's business?
- Not bad.

16:50.160 --> 16:53.436
Hey Liangzi. Not working today?

16:54.680 --> 16:55.351
Dad...

16:55.800 --> 16:58.872
- You're back late.
- Had a couple of extra students.

16:59.320 --> 17:00.878
- I have to call someone back.
- Okay.

17:05.839 --> 17:07.272
Liangzi, watch the shop for me.

17:50.120 --> 17:51.314
Hey, you!

18:02.800 --> 18:03.994
Come on in!

18:04.720 --> 18:06.472
Look around.

18:09.120 --> 18:11.634
- Anything special?
- Can I see your stereos?

18:11.800 --> 18:14.030
Sure, we have a good choice.

18:17.800 --> 18:20.633
This one has a 3-disc tray...

18:20.800 --> 18:22.791
Two cassette slots, a radio...

18:22.960 --> 18:24.518
- Like to hear it?
- Sure.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.631
- Let's try a CD.
- Fine.

18:40.360 --> 18:43.158
Nice sound, isn't it?

18:47.200 --> 18:49.589
I'm famished...
You two want some?

18:58.440 --> 19:00.749
- Good bass sound, right?
- Not bad.

19:12.640 --> 19:15.552
- Lovely song... Who is it?
- Sally Yeh.

19:17.960 --> 19:20.394
It's lovely...
I wish I knew Cantonese.

19:26.640 --> 19:28.358
Come back if you want anything.

19:28.880 --> 19:29.869
Take care.

19:35.840 --> 19:36.829
- Chopsticks.
- Okay.

19:38.400 --> 19:40.038
Jinsheng, try one.

19:49.440 --> 19:51.317
Wasn't that a great song?

19:56.440 --> 19:59.352
- I made them, how's the taste?
- Good, as usual.

20:11.080 --> 20:14.072
- What's wrong with him?
- Who knows? He's the elite one.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.433
I brought you something good.

20:20.400 --> 20:23.119
- What is it?
- Hair Beauty, it's an elite product.

20:23.320 --> 20:24.389
Really?

20:24.840 --> 20:26.592
It creates ten or more styles.

20:27.160 --> 20:28.718
Thank you.

20:29.400 --> 20:31.311
- Have some more.
- Is there enough?

20:46.720 --> 20:48.119
What's the matter?

21:09.880 --> 21:11.154
You asked for it?

21:12.320 --> 21:13.548
Did you buy it?

21:14.560 --> 21:15.993
Or borrow it?

21:28.880 --> 21:30.154
What's the matter?

21:34.600 --> 21:36.079
Jinsheng...

21:38.840 --> 21:40.478
Have you gone crazy?

21:50.200 --> 21:51.872
Why are you following me?

21:52.320 --> 21:53.673
What is the matter?

21:55.520 --> 21:58.193
You really don't know?
Or are you pretending?

22:01.440 --> 22:02.714
What do you mean?

22:03.680 --> 22:07.150
You eat from the same bowl as him,
like a couple!

22:08.800 --> 22:11.075
I offered you some, but you

22:11.240 --> 22:12.229
- refused.
- Disgusting!

22:12.720 --> 22:14.278
You are being disgusting.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.518
You must stop hanging out with him.

22:26.080 --> 22:29.356
Who do you think you are? What right
have you to tell me what to do?

22:32.440 --> 22:33.759
You're hurting me.

22:40.440 --> 22:41.873
I don't get it.

22:47.080 --> 22:48.513
You're hurting me

22:49.880 --> 22:51.552
because I care for you.

26:14.600 --> 26:15.828
So you've made your decision.

26:51.480 --> 26:52.754
We are still good friends.

27:01.520 --> 27:02.635
Come on, Liangzi...

27:36.120 --> 27:38.998
Are you on Viagra?
Following her around all day?

28:00.520 --> 28:01.669
Liang Jianjun!

28:03.320 --> 28:04.719
Playing it rough, huh?

28:34.520 --> 28:36.431
You two make it hard for me.

28:38.240 --> 28:39.593
Missing him already?

28:50.080 --> 28:51.195
See you.

29:32.320 --> 29:34.436
Boss Zhang, long time no see.

29:36.240 --> 29:37.878
Do me a favor...

29:38.640 --> 29:39.675
What is it?

29:41.080 --> 29:42.672
Get me a gun.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.228
A gun?

29:47.040 --> 29:48.678
Sorry, there's no way.

30:12.440 --> 30:14.271
How long will the dog live?

30:15.800 --> 30:18.951
The guy said fifteen years,
if it's treated well.

30:19.480 --> 30:20.913
Fifteen years...

30:21.800 --> 30:23.597
Takes us to 2014.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.319
That's right.

30:27.560 --> 30:29.516
So we'll be turning forty

30:30.840 --> 30:32.353
when it dies.

30:35.000 --> 30:38.834
Why say that?
Can't you say something nice?

30:39.000 --> 30:40.433
You'll always be 18.

31:30.440 --> 31:31.634
Don't move!

31:34.120 --> 31:35.678
What is this for?

31:39.160 --> 31:41.628
To blow up that bastard Liangzi.

31:43.440 --> 31:44.839
Are you crazy?

34:02.120 --> 34:03.792
Are the peach buns dry yet?

34:06.640 --> 34:07.629
Not yet.

34:07.800 --> 34:11.475
Peach buns are white and
tasteless these days.

34:12.199 --> 34:13.838
The ones your mother made
were much better.

34:14.440 --> 34:16.873
The flour smells different, too.

34:18.400 --> 34:20.833
I'll have to go to Shahe
again in July.

34:22.040 --> 34:24.315
What's happening at your
old friend Wu's?

34:25.080 --> 34:27.150
His daughter Lilin is pregnant.

34:27.840 --> 34:29.717
The baby will turn one month in July.

34:40.440 --> 34:42.271
Dad, I have a boyfriend.

34:43.440 --> 34:44.270
Who?

34:46.360 --> 34:47.349
Jinsheng.

34:51.960 --> 34:53.313
You're not happy?

34:56.080 --> 34:58.355
It's your business,
you decide if it's good or not.

35:07.960 --> 35:09.552
I'll get some water.

35:36.080 --> 35:37.593
Let's go home.

36:02.640 --> 36:04.073
Come on!

36:04.880 --> 36:09.271
Great! I'll take you
all bowling sometime.

36:09.920 --> 36:12.150
That's fine.

36:12.320 --> 36:13.230
Of course!

36:14.040 --> 36:16.031
Can't you just turn it off?

36:16.200 --> 36:19.476
But my phone brings good news.

36:19.640 --> 36:23.235
Coal's gone up again,
another 100 per ton.

36:23.600 --> 36:25.158
Stop that! Come on...

36:29.280 --> 36:32.989
We're ready. Lovely lady, look at me.

36:44.080 --> 36:45.195
Liangzi...

36:49.800 --> 36:50.755
Liangzi...

36:54.920 --> 36:56.433
Liang Jianjun!

37:28.840 --> 37:30.592
Please page 72801.

37:32.480 --> 37:33.629
My name is Shen.

37:35.400 --> 37:36.958
Have him call me back.

38:51.040 --> 38:52.632
<i>In local news,</i>

38:52.800 --> 38:55.075
<i>the Forestry Authority has sent up
twelve planes</i>

38:55.240 --> 38:59.392
<i>to re-seed forest in the
Jinzhong-Luiliang district.</i>

38:59.600 --> 39:03.036
<i>In other news, Shanxi district....</i>

39:18.840 --> 39:19.909
Liangzi...

39:27.720 --> 39:29.790
I've been looking for you all day.

39:31.240 --> 39:32.514
Seriously?

39:41.920 --> 39:45.071
I'm getting married on May 26th.
Here's your invitation.

40:10.240 --> 40:11.673
You absolutely must come.

40:13.680 --> 40:15.671
I can't. I'm leaving.

40:32.920 --> 40:33.989
Where are you going?

40:36.480 --> 40:37.469
Dunno.

40:37.960 --> 40:39.234
Hebei...

40:40.360 --> 40:43.557
Henan, Inner Mongolia, wherever.

40:58.080 --> 40:59.433
When will you be back?

41:01.080 --> 41:02.308
Never.

41:12.040 --> 41:13.712
You don't mean it, do you?

41:27.840 --> 41:28.829
I'm going.

41:30.120 --> 41:31.951
You won't even say goodbye?

41:34.760 --> 41:36.796
I already did,
in the club the other night.

45:10.800 --> 45:13.712
Baby Zhang Daole.

45:14.600 --> 45:16.795
Are you really giving him that name?

45:17.440 --> 45:18.998
Sure I am!

45:21.360 --> 45:22.713
Zhang Daole.

45:23.880 --> 45:27.429
Daddy will make you lots of dollars.

45:47.480 --> 45:55.956
<b>MOUNTAINS MAY DEPART</b>

46:02.800 --> 46:05.473
Okay, get ready for the photo,

46:05.840 --> 46:07.637
move to the middle!

46:13.280 --> 46:14.838
Move to the middle,

46:15.440 --> 46:16.919
look this way!

46:18.480 --> 46:21.517
Come on, closer together,
look this way!

46:22.160 --> 46:25.232
Ready. 1, 2, 3, done!

46:44.520 --> 46:48.229
<b>2014</b>

47:18.320 --> 47:19.958
- Go to Daddy.
- Be good.

49:10.240 --> 49:11.389
Breathe in.

49:12.440 --> 49:13.509
Breath out.

49:14.480 --> 49:15.833
Breathe in again.

49:17.560 --> 49:18.197
Breathe out.

49:20.400 --> 49:21.515
Breathe out.

49:32.560 --> 49:33.834
Where do you work?

49:34.400 --> 49:35.879
Underground... Mining.

49:36.960 --> 49:40.509
I suggest you get another check-up
in a bigger hospital.

49:45.280 --> 49:46.599
Migrant worker?

49:48.400 --> 49:49.628
From where?

53:15.880 --> 53:17.472
Let's go to the hospital first.

53:30.520 --> 53:32.670
Surgery, chemotherapy...

53:33.760 --> 53:34.829
They cost big money.

53:39.200 --> 53:41.794
Then give me the numbers of your
friends and relatives.

53:42.280 --> 53:44.475
I'll borrow money from them tomorrow.

53:48.920 --> 53:50.114
Makes no sense.

53:51.480 --> 53:53.232
Borrowing money is a serious matter,

53:54.120 --> 53:55.599
I'd have to go in person.

54:24.680 --> 54:27.353
- Where's your wife from?
- Handan.

54:30.120 --> 54:31.473
Handan's okay?

54:33.320 --> 54:36.153
The price of coal stays low,
the mine may close.

54:37.760 --> 54:39.352
They're in trouble here too.

54:40.320 --> 54:42.117
Small mines are prohibited now.

54:42.600 --> 54:45.068
I've become a welder myself.

54:45.560 --> 54:47.710
A welder? Skilled work!

54:49.880 --> 54:51.552
You've just got back...

54:51.720 --> 54:55.105
- If you need anything, just say.
- Sure.

54:57.880 --> 54:59.552
You're back just in time.

54:59.960 --> 55:02.838
I'm off to Beijing next month
for my visa.

55:03.360 --> 55:04.713
Visa?

55:09.000 --> 55:10.479
For Almaty.

55:13.360 --> 55:16.113
China Petroleum is laying
pipelines there.

55:17.080 --> 55:18.559
They need welders.

55:20.360 --> 55:21.475
Almaty?

55:22.240 --> 55:25.391
It's in Kazakhstan.
Just beyond Mount Tian.

55:28.520 --> 55:29.953
I'm taking a chance.

55:31.040 --> 55:33.349
I have to deposit 30,000 yuans.

55:34.080 --> 55:36.116
Had to borrow it from my two brothers

55:36.880 --> 55:38.393
and a couple of other friends.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.116
It could take a year's salary
to pay them back.

55:44.280 --> 55:45.395
I'm sure you'll manage.

55:46.360 --> 55:48.669
- It will work out.
- Yeah.

55:48.840 --> 55:50.432
Oil is a good business.

55:55.840 --> 55:57.478
Zhang Jinsheng has gotten big.

55:58.960 --> 56:01.076
He has investments in Shanghai.

56:02.080 --> 56:03.672
He's a real capitalist.

56:12.080 --> 56:13.672
But he and Tao are divorced.

56:25.040 --> 56:26.075
Cheers.

56:29.960 --> 56:32.155
Just say if you need help
with anything.

56:45.000 --> 56:46.115
I'm fine.

57:10.560 --> 57:14.439
Standing next to me is our
French groom Olivier.

57:14.600 --> 57:18.275
With such a fragrant bride,
your future's bright,

57:18.440 --> 57:20.271
your home is a home, riches are yours!

57:20.440 --> 57:23.273
You'll be running the
Bank of China in no time.

57:25.440 --> 57:27.590
On this joyful occasion,

57:27.800 --> 57:29.358
I want to ask Olivier.

57:29.520 --> 57:31.431
Are you happy?

57:31.840 --> 57:32.829
I'm very happy.

57:33.000 --> 57:35.878
- Louder please. Are you happy?
- Happy!

57:38.240 --> 57:41.630
To celebrate the union of this
wonderful couple,

57:41.800 --> 57:45.713
Shen Tao, close friend of the
bride Wang Ting,

57:45.880 --> 57:47.916
is presenting them with
precious gifts.

57:48.080 --> 57:50.958
His-and-hers iPhones!

57:57.840 --> 58:00.593
Mrs Shen... Where are you?

58:00.618 --> 58:02.855
- Mrs Shen!
- I'm here!

58:06.560 --> 58:08.039
Congratulations!

58:11.480 --> 58:14.233
Now I ask the couple to
thank Mrs Shen.

58:14.400 --> 58:15.799
First bow!

58:16.800 --> 58:18.153
Second bow!

58:18.920 --> 58:20.399
Third bow!

58:23.080 --> 58:24.035
Mrs Shen?

58:24.880 --> 58:27.519
Mrs Shen...
Someone's asking for you outside.

58:28.200 --> 58:29.189
Oh, thank you.

58:39.080 --> 58:40.149
Shen Tao...

58:41.720 --> 58:42.835
You are... ?

58:44.280 --> 58:45.679
You don't know me.

58:46.680 --> 58:49.319
I'm... Liangzi's wife.

58:50.240 --> 58:51.309
Liangzi...

58:52.040 --> 58:53.359
Liangzi is back?

58:54.960 --> 58:56.188
Yes, he is.

58:59.200 --> 59:00.474
How is he?

59:06.760 --> 59:07.875
He's not good.

59:11.680 --> 59:12.954
Not good...

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:26.915
Come in.

01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:30.869
- You came.
- Yes.

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:34.709
Where's Liangzi?

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:39.113
He's a big boy.

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:42.154
- Oh, he's asleep.
- Just dropped off.

01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:57.595
Liangzi...

01:00:58.080 --> 01:00:59.149
you came back.

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:06.632
You should have told me.

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:26.592
Your's baby so cute.

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:29.669
He's alright.

01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:33.873
And you? How are you doing?

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:35.989
Okay.

01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:37.989
Where's your boy?

01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:42.959
He's with Zhang Jinsheng.

01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:46.394
Going to the International School
in Shanghai.

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:52.153
Not with you?

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:00.353
He won the custody.

01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:04.837
And conditions are better in Shanghai.

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:30.913
Can you afford it?

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:32.229
Don't worry.

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:38.758
Thank you for helping.

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:46.992
It's really no big deal.

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:54.950
Do you still sing at the New Year
dance party?

01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:58.513
Not any more.

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:08.674
I can't come up with good
lyrics any more.

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:31.109
Your keys.

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:21.195
He seems okay. He's from Yuci.

01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:23.919
He is in the building industry.

01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:26.355
He's a widower,
raising his daughter alone.

01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:29.469
He has enough money to
take care of her.

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:30.909
A daughter?

01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:34.591
Well, ask Tao to have a chat with him.

01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:39.033
She's past forty,
it gets harder to find someone.

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:41.270
She can't stay single all her life.

01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:43.391
She should have a family of her own.

01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:47.598
You talk to her.

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:49.833
She won't listen to me.

01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:55.113
Auntie...

01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:57.555
You're back, Tao.

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:02.075
It seems the gas station
is doing well.

01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:03.679
Yes, it's pretty good.

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:07.039
- We should be going, Dad.
- Lets.

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:09.315
You're off somewhere?

01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:11.436
Dad's wartime friend has a birthday.

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:14.319
I'll drive him to the station
for the train to Shahe.

01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:17.079
- I should be going.
- Please.

01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:19.591
- Come and see us, Tao.
- Look after yourself, Auntie.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:20.750
I'm leaving.

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:22.115
- Shall we, Dad?
- Let's go.

01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:30.510
- You have your ID?
- Yes.

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:33.156
- Train ticket?
- Yes.

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:35.151
- Cellphone?
- Yes.

01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:36.150
- Then let's go.
- Okay.

01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:40.992
- Xiao Xing, watch the place for me.
-  Yes, ma'am, drive safely.

01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:36.195
Old Wu?

01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:38.789
I've arrived.

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:42.831
No rush, take your time.

01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:47.036
I'll be in the waiting room.

01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:09.709
Doctor.

01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:12.154
The relative's here?

01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:17.069
You are...?

01:08:18.399 --> 01:08:19.469
I'm his daughter.

01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:22.518
Please show me your ID.

01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:35.631
Are you planning burial or cremation?

01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:38.398
You'll be taking the body, right?

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:43.033
Yes.

01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:45.158
Where's my dad?

01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:48.191
Wait a moment,
I'll make the preparations.

01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:10.549
Tao...

01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:16.031
It's fixed,
the ambulance will drive him back.

01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:17.549
But...

01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:19.595
What is it?

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:23.470
They want 12,000,
including the road toll.

01:09:24.359 --> 01:09:25.395
Gas excluded.

01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:27.109
It's fine.

01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:33.956
I'm very, very sorry...

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:38.356
that things turned out this way.

01:09:39.359 --> 01:09:42.636
Don't say that.
Your birthday was spoiled.

01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:03.672
Hello, are you Mrs Shen?

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.036
- I am.
- Please sign gere.

01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:16.358
Thank you, please follow me.

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:49.349
Daole...

01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:51.992
Why don't you talk to your Mama?

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:54.028
Call me Ma.

01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:56.949
Mummy.

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:02.477
Mummy? Who taught you that?

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:04.837
Be grown-up! Say "Ma".

01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:09.114
Ma.

01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:17.835
That scarf makes you look girlish.

01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:02.229
Let's go home.

01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:56.994
- Okay, Mum...
- Sister, don't be so sad.

01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:10.637
Mr Shen... has flown up to heaven.

01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:15.917
But his features remain.
Alas, it is sad indeed.

01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:21.756
His daughter cherishes his memory.
His grandson pays his respects.

01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:24.391
Light incense!

01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:28.517
Light incense for Grandad.

01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:42.909
Kneel.

01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:45.955
Kneel!

01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:48.832
Kneel for Grandad!

01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:58.514
Dad, Daole came back to see you.

01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:22.151
- Mummy!
<i>- Do you miss me?</i>

01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:24.353
What's happening there?

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:27.314
<i>Your Dad and I went to the
consulate today,</i>

01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:29.636
<i>the immigration paperwork is done.</i>

01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:34.191
<i>Dad called the lawyer in Melbourne,
we've bought the house.</i>

01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:36.356
The white one?

01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:38.469
<i>That's right.</i>

01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:40.832
Can we see penguins there?

01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:43.517
<i>The penguins are on Phillip Island...</i>

01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:46.558
<i>But there are kangaroos near
the house.</i>

01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:48.235
Kangaroos!

01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:49.515
Kangaroos!

01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:56.433
<i>Yes, the house is by
a conservation area.</i>

01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:59.160
<i>Your Dad has spoken to
the best local school.</i>

01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:02.437
<i>It has the best soccer team</i>

01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:04.358
<i>and the best dorm.</i>

01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:07.798
<i>You'll have such a grown-up
life, Dollar!</i>

01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:09.992
<i>The other boys will be Australians.</i>

01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:11.878
<i>Amongst them,</i>

01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:14.793
<i>you'll be speaking English in no time.</i>

01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:17.597
<i>How does that sound?</i>

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.036
Mama, smoking's bad for you.

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:16.791
You are truly Zhang Jinsheng's son.

01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:19.151
You both like lecturing people.

01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:24.119
- Dad's name is Peter now.
- Peter?

01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:28.398
He even has a foreign name.

01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:39.151
You're better off with your dad.

01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:42.152
Stay with him in Shanghai.

01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:46.077
You can go to International School
and then abroad.

01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:54.872
Your Mama is no use to you.

01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:10.440
Nobody can be with you all
through life.

01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:15.757
We're fated to be apart.

01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:18.516
Mummy...

01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:20.837
<i>- Have you eaten?</i>
- Not yet?

01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:24.398
<i>Didn't I tell you to eat your
meals on time?</i>

01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:28.040
<i>Dad's booked your flight back,</i>

01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:30.834
<i>and I've booked your
favourite restaurant.</i>

01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:33.875
Out of here!

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:37.318
Let me speak to Zhang Jinsheng!
Thank you.

01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:43.111
<i>- Tao.</i>
- Zhang Jinsheng...

01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:46.829
Will you tell that woman not to speak
to my son in front of me?

01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:50.115
<i>- What?</i>
- Do you two have no sense at all?

01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:53.431
<i>I need to book the ticket for Dollar.</i>

01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:56.837
The flight ticket?
No need. I'll book it myself.

01:21:58.600 --> 01:21:59.555
<i>Is that okay?</i>

01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:02.792
I'll get Daole back to you
safe and sound.

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:04.598
Okay? That's all.

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:25.516
Mama's made you some long dumplings.

01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:28.554
Eat long dumplings, grow taller!

01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:50.790
Like it?

01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:53.190
Tastes good! Very nice.

01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:36.395
Why's this train so slow, Mama?

01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:38.918
Because it's the slow train.

01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:42.318
Why didn't we fly or take
a fast train?

01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:48.389
The slow train gives me a bit
more time with you.

01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:29.752
Like the song?

01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:44.314
This is the place Dad wants
to take me to.

01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:05.356
I've made you a set of keys.

01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:09.789
The big one's for the yard,
the small one for the house.

01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:14.118
You should have a set of keys
to your home.

01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:20.832
You'll always be welcome there.

01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:52.511
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:54.950
Never seen you on the train before.

01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:58.876
Yeah, I just moved in and
train is easier.

01:28:00.278 --> 01:28:02.669
Oh... no wonder.

01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:14.919
We learned about surname yesterday.

01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:17.391
Which surname is...

01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:19.830
Xing!

01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:25.188
And as I have told you, there are
about 100 surnames in China,

01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:27.590
such as Zhaoqian Sun Lee.

01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:29.227
I think it's going to
take a little time

01:28:29.230 --> 01:28:31.261
for you to remember
all those surnames.

01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:33.916
Now, what about personal names?

01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:36.634
You will learned about
personal names which is

01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:38.269
Ming...

01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:42.435
Dollar! Dollar... what's your
personal name?

01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:45.113
Dollar is dollar.

01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:50.236
Oh, I know. i think Dollar
means the US dollar.

01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:54.989
And whoever gave you that name
must have been clueless,

01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:57.879
since the US dollar has been
free fall for ages.

01:28:58.040 --> 01:29:00.110
He should have called you, Renminbi.

01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:04.837
What's your mother name?

01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:07.393
I don't have a mother.

01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:10.635
No mother, so what are you?

01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:14.352
A Monkey King... Sun Wukong.

01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:15.748
Come out from the stone, right?

01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:20.193
I was a test tube baby.

01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:23.677
You still need a mother for that.

01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:29.276
What's your Chinese name, Mia?

01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:31.675
I forgot.

01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:34.070
Okay!

01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:39.914
It was in 2014, eleven years ago.

01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:43.758
The country was caught up in that
big anti-corruption campaign.

01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:47.319
I went to Hong Kong and ran into
Xing at the Four Seasons.

01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:51.038
He couldn't decide whether to
go back to Mainland China or not.

01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:54.429
I called him "Xing" and
he was furious.

01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:55.555
Why?

01:29:56.680 --> 01:29:59.558
Because "Xing" sounds like the
word "Criminal" in Chinese.

01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:00.914
Poor him!

01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:04.356
I said, that's the name you
inherited from your Dad!

01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:10.231
2014...

01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:13.474
Happens to be the year
we left Shanghai.

01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:17.237
I've just gone through customs when
I got a WeChat message...

01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:21.958
saying that Xing was being prosecuted.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.468
Jinsheng... You've been hiding
here long enough,

01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:26.993
it's about time to go back.

01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:28.195
We'll see.

01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:30.556
Your kid has suffered so
much because of you.

01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:33.837
- Yeah... How's boss Liu lately?
- He retired.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:35.274
A safe landing.

01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:38.432
Hi, key.

01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:41.476
- Where's yours?
- I lost it.

01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:42.959
Again?

01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:45.279
Boys...

01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:46.989
will be boys.

01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:49.799
Can I have a word with you?

01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:54.196
Talk.

01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:39.396
No problem.

01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:57.430
<b>... right now. I could be
doing anything.</b>

01:31:58.000 --> 01:31:59.479
<b>Just wanna tell you that I plan
to quit college.</b>

01:31:59.640 --> 01:32:00.749
<b>Don't even know what I wanna do.</b>

01:32:00.775 --> 01:32:01.940
<b>Maybe just live for the moment,
simple as that.</b>

01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:04.995
<b>I mean, nothing really interests
me right now.</b>

01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:17.515
Hi... Peter.

01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:43.511
You can do it all, can you?

01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:50.954
You're the Top Gun?

01:32:52.120 --> 01:32:53.473
Superman?

01:32:54.760 --> 01:32:56.557
Who do you think you are?

01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:02.278
- What?
- You say you can do anything?

01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:04.636
That's not right.

01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:07.360
Can't you learn your old
man's Chinese?

01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:14.998
You understand "old man"?

01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:18.951
Old man means Father.

01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:22.118
I'm your old man.

01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:25.110
The father of Zhang Daole.

01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:27.516
Yeah...

01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:31.993
You are my dad

01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:40.349
but it's like Google translate...
it's your real son.

01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:26.949
Dad...

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:09.629
<i>- Hello...</i>
- Hi...

01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:10.675
Delivery!

01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:28.235
Hi Dollar...

01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:31.510
- You live here?
- Yeah.

01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:33.758
Yeah, I told you I moved here.

01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:37.274
Guess what, you are my first guest.

01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:40.199
I'm not your guest.

01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:44.274
You wouldn't want me.
I'm just making a delivery.

01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:49.352
Whoever arrived is a guest.

01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:56.316
- Come in!
- Okay.

01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:02.151
- Here's your order.
- Come in.

01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:04.549
May I?

01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:07.555
Sure...

01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:10.432
You're officially invited.

01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:13.269
Okay!

01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:20.471
We'll take a 10 minutes break.

01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:24.778
And after that we
come back and then we can

01:36:24.801 --> 01:36:27.879
listen to some classic
old Chinese songs.

01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:29.438
10 minutes.

01:36:56.080 --> 01:36:56.956
Cantonese?

01:36:57.720 --> 01:36:59.438
It's Cantonese songs.

01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:01.795
One of these old classic
from the 90's.

01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:06.793
It seems like something
I have heard before.

01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:13.435
Okay, many Cantonese songs there

01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:16.598
sounds pretty much alike.

01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:22.589
You are from Kwang Tung?

01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:25.313
No, I'm from Hong Kong.

01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:28.429
But I moved to Toronto in 96.

01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:32.317
Why do you come to Australia?

01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:34.958
Why did you come to Australia?

01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:43.679
It wasn't my idea.

01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:48.392
My dad wants us to come.

01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:51.356
Then you're not a test tube baby.

01:37:52.920 --> 01:37:56.674
A test tube baby still has parents.

01:37:57.480 --> 01:37:59.072
Okay... then what's your
mother's name?

01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:03.199
Don't remember.

01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:23.672
- Hi!
- Hi!

01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:25.479
You have a table for two?

01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:26.597
Yes, this way please!

01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:42.472
- Sir.
- Thank you.

01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:47.473
Any jet lag?

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:49.752
You know me, I'm okay.

01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:51.638
I travelled a lot.

01:38:55.640 --> 01:38:58.393
Is it necesary for us to meet?

01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:02.633
I think my lawyer makes everything
very clear in the letter.

01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:06.591
You know a lot of details were missed.

01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:09.758
When we were married,
I pay all the utilities bills.

01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:11.797
My lawyer done some calculations.

01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:14.879
He says you should covered
half those bills.

01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:18.197
So... that's the way you want
to play it?

01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:22.636
What about all the money I paid for?

01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:24.119
Your clothes... your alcohol...

01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:26.271
And not to mention all the
groceries in the house.

01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:30.679
Maybe I should start doing
some calculations too.

01:39:56.520 --> 01:39:57.509
Hello?

01:39:57.520 --> 01:39:59.112
<i>It's me... Dollar.</i>

01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:03.079
I didn't order delivery.

01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:06.558
<i>I'm not here delivering.
I'm here as your guest.</i>

01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:16.995
Come in.

01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:49.509
- Hi!
- Hi!

01:40:51.640 --> 01:40:53.198
Haven't eaten, ain't you?

01:40:57.240 --> 01:40:58.275
Yeah, come in!

01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:06.794
Sorry you have to see all
those back there.

01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:10.274
I didn't see anything.

01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:15.439
He's my ex-husband.

01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:22.193
You don't have to tell me.

01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:26.197
I know about sex also.

01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:29.595
Really?

01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:36.755
So... how old are you?

01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:44.553
You know... You shouldn't let
these things bug you.

01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:49.793
They are best forgotten!

01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:56.349
Very true.

01:41:57.480 --> 01:41:59.391
That's just my story.

01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:02.712
Your story... his story.

01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:05.828
It's really nothing new.

01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:11.479
So... shall we eat?

01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:13.435
Of course!

01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:40.149
My dad.

01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:41.272
Hello.

01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:45.115
I really need to talk to him.

01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:47.153
Could you translate for us?

01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:50.556
- Please?
- Sure.

01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:18.430
Hello.

01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:22.549
Who are you?

01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:26.236
A friend...

01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:28.356
I am Dollar's friend.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.434
So you want to hear all about
our family problems?

01:43:50.040 --> 01:43:53.271
I think he wants to talk with you,
so he asked me to translate.

01:43:55.800 --> 01:43:56.676
Shoot!

01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:06.555
I want to move out and quit college,

01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:11.359
there's nothing in the world
that really interests me right now.

01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:16.911
I mean... I could be doing anything.

01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:25.196
He wants to move out and quit college.

01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:31.429
Nothing interests him,

01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:33.637
so he could end up doing anything.

01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:39.397
I have just one question for him.

01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:41.878
If he moves out,
where's he going to live?

01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:48.068
Who do you think you are? How will you
survive without a college degree?

01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:50.674
Where did you pick up all this shit?

01:44:55.240 --> 01:44:58.437
Just one question, where are
you going to live if not here?

01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:03.696
And... what're you going to live on if

01:45:03.722 --> 01:45:05.296
you don't even have a college diploma?

01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:07.590
I'm free to do what I want.

01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:12.599
He wants to have

01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:14.510
his freedom.

01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:18.069
Do you know

01:45:19.120 --> 01:45:20.633
what freedom is?

01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:27.950
China doesn't permit
individuals to own guns.

01:45:28.120 --> 01:45:32.318
But Australia just changed
the law, you can buy guns.

01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:36.959
I now own a pile of guns,
but no-one to fire them at!

01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:38.473
So what's freedom?

01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:40.039
Freedom is bullshit!

01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:45.479
Your dad says

01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:51.912
freedom can be interpreted in
many different ways.

01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:04.155
You know what...

01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:09.593
just go play with your guns.

01:46:13.080 --> 01:46:14.911
I don't need your permission.

01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:30.389
I'm...

01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:32.277
getting the feeling of dejavu.

01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:33.269
Yeah...

01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:37.270
Here... you're driving and
I'm your passenger.

01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:39.068
I have see this before.

01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:41.634
You're daydreaming.

01:47:44.200 --> 01:47:48.318
Didn't you says sometimes recalled
the previous incarnation?

01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:52.355
I don't believe in reincarnation.

01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:55.192
Live's just repeat itself.

01:47:56.320 --> 01:47:59.198
That's why you find it familiar.

01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:04.794
I really have lived this
moment before.

01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:09.711
Okay...

01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:04.635
Look, there's the Twelve Apostles.

01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:08.548
When I first came, there were eight.

01:50:09.080 --> 01:50:11.514
Now... there's only three.

01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:51.233
What's this?

01:51:01.320 --> 01:51:02.355
That's my secret.

01:51:07.760 --> 01:51:09.273
I wouldn't ask then.

01:51:23.440 --> 01:51:24.668
My mum...

01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:28.072
she gave them to me.

01:51:38.640 --> 01:51:40.517
There are the keys to my home.

01:51:51.760 --> 01:51:53.193
What's your mum like?

01:52:00.160 --> 01:52:01.673
I haven't seen her

01:52:04.360 --> 01:52:05.839
since I was seven.

01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:09.354
She's still alive?

01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:16.359
As far as I know,

01:52:20.520 --> 01:52:22.112
As far as you know,

01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:29.318
so you remember her?

01:52:39.880 --> 01:52:41.154
Her name is Tao

01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:44.799
like waves.

01:52:56.400 --> 01:52:57.992
You should go back to visit her.

01:53:00.160 --> 01:53:01.229
It's easy.

01:53:05.960 --> 01:53:07.791
You'll say the same to you.

01:53:16.520 --> 01:53:17.396
Yeah...

01:53:25.920 --> 01:53:28.070
When I first came to Australia,

01:53:30.840 --> 01:53:32.910
I always keep my phone on.

01:53:37.080 --> 01:53:38.638
My mum was old,

01:53:42.120 --> 01:53:43.269
I want her

01:53:44.480 --> 01:53:47.040
to be able to find me
whenever she wants.

01:53:52.320 --> 01:53:54.072
Then... Just go back to Toronto.

01:53:57.640 --> 01:54:00.154
I don't have many calls to
make in the city.

01:54:05.400 --> 01:54:08.517
Whenever the phone rings,

01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:12.153
I just panic.

01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:17.149
I'm so afraid something
bad had happen.

01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:23.118
You know the hardest thing,

01:54:24.840 --> 01:54:26.956
about love is caring.

01:54:32.920 --> 01:54:33.989
I guess

01:54:38.160 --> 01:54:40.151
we have to feel the pain

01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:42.711
to know that we're in love.

01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:05.229
Well, actually I'm looking
for... it's like...

01:55:05.400 --> 01:55:06.958
goes from A city

01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:09.475
to Beijing

01:55:10.120 --> 01:55:14.352
and then from Beijing to Taiyuan,
that's the province of Shanxi

01:55:16.920 --> 01:55:19.275
A week later, back to Beijing.

01:55:19.480 --> 01:55:21.630
and then... Toronto?

01:55:22.880 --> 01:55:25.394
I actually would highly
recommend flying business

01:55:25.560 --> 01:55:27.073
because it's actually
a very long journey.

01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:30.636
And it'll definitely going to be more
comfortable for you and your son.

01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:37.793
I think economy is good enough.

01:55:38.240 --> 01:55:40.284
We're actually having
having a very good promotion

01:55:40.310 --> 01:55:42.702
at the moment for business class.

01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:46.590
It's actually a very good deal.
Would you be interested in that?

01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:48.269
Let's go!

01:55:55.360 --> 01:55:56.395
Come on!

01:55:57.600 --> 01:55:59.079
How about I let you think about it,

01:55:59.080 --> 01:56:02.595
just so you know our company...

01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:25.033
What's wrong?

01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:29.071
Why is it so difficult?

01:56:33.800 --> 01:56:35.831
If I was still 20 years,
I probably won't make

01:56:35.857 --> 01:56:37.500
the suggestion of going back.

01:56:38.920 --> 01:56:41.309
Now we're talking about
blood relation.

01:56:41.520 --> 01:56:44.990
She's yours own mother and you're her
only son and it's not going to change.

01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:47.511
But it has been so long.

01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:52.873
Time doesn't changed every thing.
That's what it has taught me.

01:56:58.360 --> 01:57:01.875
That woman there... she was so rude.

01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:05.997
Yeah...

01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:09.068
she thought we were mother and son.

01:57:11.680 --> 01:57:14.831
How would you introduced me to your
mother when we get back to Fenyang?

01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:20.757
Your teacher... your elder sister?

01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:23.389
Your girlfriend?

01:57:31.320 --> 01:57:32.309
I see.

01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:40.835
I just...

01:57:42.200 --> 01:57:43.519
Well, I was thinking.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:56.989
It's alright!

01:58:01.600 --> 01:58:02.874
It's alright!

01:58:44.440 --> 01:58:45.589
I'm sorry.

01:58:53.880 --> 01:58:55.472
Freedom is yours.

01:59:26.320 --> 01:59:27.435
Tao!

01:59:55.520 --> 01:59:56.396
Tao!

02:00:38.240 --> 02:00:38.797
Let's go.
