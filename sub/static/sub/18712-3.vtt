00:15.506 --> 00:17.346
Go on! Just one drink.

00:17.386 --> 00:20.306
- You know I can't.
- You're only the assistant manager.

00:23.643 --> 00:25.026
Love you.

00:31.466 --> 00:33.229
Listen, you.

00:33.331 --> 00:36.531
Don't think that I can't get
another you.

00:36.571 --> 00:40.011
Don't think I'm standing here
just feeling blue...

00:41.851 --> 00:45.251
Still doing your reporting from
behind a martini glass, Mr. O'Hara?

00:45.291 --> 00:47.851
Well, technically, Miss. Garland,
it's bourbon.

00:47.891 --> 00:50.411
Don't know what made me
go and change my mind...

00:51.909 --> 00:54.571
Don't know why I was feeling
so unkind.

00:56.651 --> 00:58.986
Ladies and gentlemen,
please remain calm.

00:59.011 --> 01:01.811
I'm sure it's just another
false alarm.

01:01.850 --> 01:03.559
Quickly, please.

01:03.584 --> 01:05.075
Here we go again.

01:08.770 --> 01:10.770
Check the floors for strays.

01:11.770 --> 01:13.770
This way, please.

01:30.730 --> 01:33.050
- Another place to clean, then.
- Yeah.

01:34.170 --> 01:36.170
- Billy, look at you!
- Mum, leave off.

01:41.130 --> 01:43.370
Wonderful. She's found the Jew.

01:43.410 --> 01:45.530
Do you want to wait outside, Chef?

01:45.570 --> 01:47.570
Not in front of the guests.

01:51.970 --> 01:54.810
Ladies and gentlemen,
a moment, please.

01:57.650 --> 02:01.250
For those of you who have been
rudely awakened, I apologise.

02:01.290 --> 02:05.090
And for those still to go to bed,
you also have my sympathies.

02:05.130 --> 02:07.130
But I assure you,

02:07.170 --> 02:10.610
this is the safest place to be
in the city.

02:35.770 --> 02:39.610
These things are moving fast.

02:39.650 --> 02:43.930
No time left in my hourglass.

02:43.970 --> 02:47.210
No hopes for you and me.

02:47.250 --> 02:52.090
Long gone,
they left without apology.

02:52.130 --> 02:55.210
Nothing can stop these.

02:55.250 --> 02:57.250
Cold clock hands.

02:57.290 --> 02:59.690
From turning.

02:59.730 --> 03:02.970
Pray it won't stop these.

03:03.010 --> 03:06.250
Falling sands.

03:06.290 --> 03:09.130
Raining down.

03:19.370 --> 03:21.370
Are you serious, Tom?

03:21.410 --> 03:24.410
They don't even use them any more.
They've got the Cruiser now.

03:24.450 --> 03:26.850
That's a big pounder, spitting out
100 rounds at the front,

03:26.890 --> 03:30.050
three mounted Vicker machine guns
at the back.

03:30.090 --> 03:32.090
Yeah, I know that!

03:32.130 --> 03:34.650
Can, c'est Francais, oui?
Une francaise. Bien.

03:34.690 --> 03:38.370
Je suis desolee. Je suis desolee,
de vous avoir fait attendre la.

03:38.410 --> 03:40.410
Oui, je suis desolee.

03:43.010 --> 03:45.610
Chef needs these ingredients.

03:46.690 --> 03:48.810
He does know there's a war on,
right?

03:51.450 --> 03:53.650
More families coming from
France every day.

03:53.690 --> 03:55.370
A lot don't even speak English.

03:55.410 --> 03:57.410
At this rate we'll be
running to capacity.

03:57.450 --> 03:59.690
Remember to breathe occasionally.

03:59.730 --> 04:02.130
I still feel like I'm wearing
someone else's shoes.

04:03.050 --> 04:05.050
He's... here, Mr. Garland.

04:05.090 --> 04:09.050
Apparently the Count has already
checked out of the Dorchester

04:09.090 --> 04:11.410
and the Savoy.

04:11.450 --> 04:13.690
As long as nobody interferes
with my job,

04:13.730 --> 04:16.370
I'm sure he'll have
a long and happy stay with us.

04:24.610 --> 04:26.610
Your Excellency.

04:26.650 --> 04:28.650
Lady Hamilton...

04:30.090 --> 04:33.650
You are even more radiant than
your reputation led me to believe.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.690
You're very kind.

04:35.730 --> 04:38.170
And we're honoured
that you chose our hotel.

04:38.210 --> 04:40.210
Emma, the Regent Suite, please.

04:46.490 --> 04:48.490
Mr. D'Aberville.

04:48.530 --> 04:50.930
When did you and His Excellency
travel from France?

04:50.970 --> 04:53.210
We left the Cote D'Azur
two weeks ago,

04:53.257 --> 04:54.535
just ahead of the pack.

04:54.560 --> 04:57.410
The German wolves
snapping at our heels.

04:57.450 --> 04:59.970
Only a matter of time
before they reach Paris.

05:00.010 --> 05:02.570
If there's anything
His Excellency needs,

05:02.610 --> 05:05.090
please contact either me
or Miss. Garland.

05:05.130 --> 05:07.130
He'll need something.

05:07.170 --> 05:09.170
He always needs something.

05:12.210 --> 05:14.250
You're not exactly
a ray of sunshine.

05:14.290 --> 05:16.290
I thought I could do this job.

05:16.330 --> 05:18.450
I snapped at Chef
in front of everyone.

05:18.490 --> 05:21.210
I keep saying the wrong thing
at the wrong time.

05:21.250 --> 05:23.850
That's because
you're thinking about him.

05:23.890 --> 05:26.450
I'm not thinking about Freddie.

05:26.490 --> 05:28.570
Then how did you know
'him' was him?

05:30.210 --> 05:32.210
How's he getting on, anyway?

05:32.250 --> 05:34.050
I don't know.

05:34.090 --> 05:36.490
I haven't heard from him
since he left the base.

05:40.410 --> 05:43.570
I appreciate you boys letting me
take a look around.

05:43.610 --> 05:47.090
So, you're the gentleman that
Freddie hit, aren't you?

05:47.930 --> 05:49.930
Well, it was a sucker punch.

05:49.970 --> 05:52.450
And I guess I was the sucker.

05:53.650 --> 05:56.850
So, I wanted to start by asking you

05:56.890 --> 06:00.170
about the withdrawal at Dunkirk.

06:02.733 --> 06:06.130
We did our best to provide cover,
no matter what anyone says.

06:06.170 --> 06:08.170
I'm not disagreeing.

06:08.210 --> 06:10.210
I'm just trying to understand.

06:11.690 --> 06:14.090
Well, maybe that's
the best place to start.

06:14.130 --> 06:16.770
Let people know how it feels
to be one of you,

06:16.810 --> 06:19.850
in this situation, at this time.

06:30.970 --> 06:33.810
That's the last of your...

06:33.850 --> 06:35.850
luggage, Your Excellency.

06:36.970 --> 06:39.690
Do you know what this is?

06:39.730 --> 06:41.730
Well, it's a erm...

06:41.770 --> 06:43.850
A gun, sir.

06:43.890 --> 06:47.650
This is my family heirloom.

06:49.370 --> 06:53.370
My great-grandfather
went to fight for Napoleon III.

06:54.130 --> 06:57.050
Have you ever held a gun?

06:58.029 --> 07:00.029
No.

07:01.789 --> 07:03.789
Neither had he.

07:03.829 --> 07:07.669
On his first day,
they gave him this weapon.

07:07.709 --> 07:09.709
It never left his side.

07:09.749 --> 07:12.189
Not even when he came home.

07:12.989 --> 07:15.509
Saved his life many times.

07:17.509 --> 07:20.749
See, my great-grandfather knew that,

07:20.789 --> 07:23.909
beneath our veneer of
respectability,

07:23.949 --> 07:26.589
all men are savages.

07:50.909 --> 07:52.909
What is your name?

07:52.949 --> 07:54.949
Billy, sir.

07:56.829 --> 07:58.829
Thank you, Billy.

08:00.709 --> 08:03.349
Billy's all wide-eyed and excited.

08:03.389 --> 08:05.469
He's only turned 18 today

08:05.509 --> 08:08.909
and already he's put in a request
for the Royal Engineers.

08:08.949 --> 08:10.949
I suppose he feels it's his duty.

08:10.989 --> 08:13.549
They were the sewer rats
of the last war.

08:13.589 --> 08:15.589
Came home in pieces.

08:17.429 --> 08:19.429
If they came home at all.

08:23.789 --> 08:25.789
Switchboard.

08:27.349 --> 08:30.709
Of course, Your Excellency.
I have the manager right here.

08:32.029 --> 08:35.549
He has sent back the tete de veau
twice already.

08:35.589 --> 08:38.749
I have made it with gribiche
and I have made it with ravigote,

08:38.789 --> 08:40.948
and each one was top notch.

08:40.989 --> 08:44.352
Perhaps if you were to bring
the next dish to him yourself.

08:44.461 --> 08:45.180
Right.

08:45.359 --> 08:49.989
So, you expect me to bend and scrape
in front of that chump?

08:50.029 --> 08:52.869
I am so glad
we understand each other.

09:07.869 --> 09:10.189
Did you make this?

09:10.229 --> 09:13.029
No. It was our head chef.

09:14.629 --> 09:16.989
I think there is
some fire in the eyes

09:17.029 --> 09:19.189
of my little Austrian friend.

09:19.229 --> 09:21.949
Please, speak your mind.

09:22.669 --> 09:25.829
We are just two poor refugees,
far from our homes.

09:29.989 --> 09:33.189
This is the third time
the dish has been cooked for you.

09:33.229 --> 09:37.469
There are people on rations,
starving,

09:38.349 --> 09:41.469
and you're tossing away good food
like the world hasn't changed.

09:41.509 --> 09:44.269
But the world has not changed.

09:45.389 --> 09:47.389
Not for me, at least.

09:47.429 --> 09:51.069
It has merely... shifted latitude.

09:57.749 --> 09:59.927
The government wants you
to work for them? Really?

09:59.952 --> 10:01.614
Please keep your voice down.

10:01.639 --> 10:03.958
Trading it all in to become
a civil servant.

10:03.983 --> 10:06.949
- At least you dress the part.
- Thank you, Mother.

10:09.789 --> 10:12.269
You grew up so fast.

10:12.309 --> 10:14.189
Both of you.

10:24.869 --> 10:26.869
Lady Hamilton.

10:28.469 --> 10:30.469
- May I?
- Of course.

10:37.149 --> 10:39.149
You don't remember me, do you?

10:40.749 --> 10:42.829
It was a few years ago.

10:42.869 --> 10:45.389
Yes. Of course I do.

10:45.429 --> 10:47.429
No recollection at all.

10:47.469 --> 10:49.469
I'm so sorry.

10:50.709 --> 10:52.829
Weren't you one of
Dobby Tucker's set?

10:52.869 --> 10:55.309
And now the good lady
adds insult to injury.

10:56.109 --> 10:58.469
- I'll have a coffee, please.
- Yes, sir.

10:58.509 --> 11:02.749
Well, obviously, as a woman of taste
and good manners,

11:02.789 --> 11:05.669
you find gossip abhorrent.

11:05.709 --> 11:08.869
Absolutely. I can't stand it.

11:08.909 --> 11:10.829
Then I should warn you in advance,

11:10.869 --> 11:12.784
because you were the one
who brought up Dobby Tucker.

11:12.808 --> 11:15.749
Now, let me tell you...

11:21.189 --> 11:23.189
Dis pas ca, c'est pas possible!

11:23.229 --> 11:25.309
On me I'a vole, j'en suis sur!
On me I'a vole!

11:25.349 --> 11:27.349
Quelqu'un a vole!

11:29.589 --> 11:31.589
Qu'est-ce qui se passe, Excellence?

11:31.629 --> 11:35.749
My gun! Stolen from my room
by one of your staff!

11:38.909 --> 11:41.029
You're disappointed.

11:41.069 --> 11:43.669
You came here with your story
already written.

11:43.709 --> 11:45.709
Yeah? What story's that?

11:45.749 --> 11:49.069
'Those poor young pilots,
fearful of the coming conflict.'

11:49.109 --> 11:51.109
All right, all right.

11:51.149 --> 11:54.749
But with the situation in France,
and Britain being next in line,

11:54.789 --> 11:56.789
there's gotta be some trepidation.

11:56.829 --> 11:59.669
There's no space for fear
in the cockpit, Mr. O'Hara.

12:01.429 --> 12:03.189
What's happening?

12:03.229 --> 12:06.109
We're air cover for ships,
evacuating our people from France.

12:06.149 --> 12:09.109
I thought the evacuation was over.
In Dunkirk, yes. But St Nazaire,

12:09.149 --> 12:11.189
Nantes, we've still got
a lot of men out there.

12:11.229 --> 12:14.349
That sounds dangerous.
Don't worry about me, Mr. O'Hara.

12:27.440 --> 12:29.440
This is a very serious situation.

12:30.600 --> 12:33.120
I know guests like the Count
can be difficult.

12:34.680 --> 12:38.400
But if he says the gun is priceless,
we must accept that at face value.

12:38.440 --> 12:41.560
And the only people
with access to his room

12:41.600 --> 12:44.360
are us, the staff.

12:45.800 --> 12:47.800
Funny, innit?

12:47.840 --> 12:50.560
Nothing ever went missing before.

12:50.600 --> 12:53.200
Then er... Herr Klein shows up.

12:53.240 --> 12:56.280
I did not take the gentleman's gun!
You were in his room.

12:56.320 --> 12:58.440
Should have seen him
when he came back.

12:58.480 --> 12:59.988
Acting strange.

13:00.013 --> 13:02.480
Most of the kitchen staff
act strange.

13:02.520 --> 13:05.880
- Hardly a basis for guilt.
- Why not look in his locker, then?

13:05.920 --> 13:08.240
We're not turning this
into a witch-hunt.

13:08.280 --> 13:11.120
You could look in mine as well.
Look in them all.

13:16.640 --> 13:18.640
This is wrong.

13:18.680 --> 13:21.160
Mr. Klein was the last
member of staff to be seen

13:21.200 --> 13:24.200
in the Count's room,
and if there's nothing to hide...

13:27.000 --> 13:30.320
Very clean locker, Mrs. Hobbs.
Just get to the German's!

13:30.360 --> 13:32.360
Chef!

13:45.400 --> 13:47.794
Well, there's no gun.

14:24.480 --> 14:28.000
These belonged to the late
Lord Hamilton.

14:29.720 --> 14:32.400
Mr. Klein,
why are they in your locker?

14:35.400 --> 14:37.400
It's always the quiet ones.

14:38.320 --> 14:40.320
Miss. Garland, inform the police.

14:42.040 --> 14:43.840
Miss. Garland!

14:53.960 --> 14:56.600
That's what you were doing
during the siren.

14:56.640 --> 14:58.640
Taking the cufflinks.

14:58.680 --> 15:00.680
I'm sorry, Miss. Garland.

15:00.720 --> 15:02.720
It is my family.

15:02.760 --> 15:04.760
I had... I had no choice.

15:04.800 --> 15:07.200
It was the only way
I could get enough money.

15:35.240 --> 15:37.520
One a week for the past two months.

15:37.560 --> 15:41.160
Sent to his wife and daughter,
to where they're hiding in France.

15:41.200 --> 15:44.320
Each letter has been returned,
undelivered, unopened.

15:44.360 --> 15:48.120
Well, there's a simple answer
to that, then. You can't do that.

15:48.160 --> 15:50.760
Well, you shouldn't do that,
but yeah, you can.

15:50.800 --> 15:52.800
It's simple, you just, you know...

15:52.840 --> 15:55.600
Mr. O'Hara, I just wanted
your professional opinion.

15:55.640 --> 15:57.880
Do you think he was trying
to get money to...

15:57.920 --> 16:01.080
To bring his family over here?
Yeah. I'd bet on it.

16:01.120 --> 16:03.320
They're rounding up the Jews
in Europe,

16:03.360 --> 16:05.560
and France isn't exactly
sympathetic.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.600
I feel for the guy.

16:07.640 --> 16:09.640
No, thank you.

16:09.680 --> 16:11.680
Hey, be careful, though.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.560
Because?

16:13.600 --> 16:15.600
I know that look.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.600
Mr. O'Hara, you do not know my looks.

16:21.160 --> 16:23.160
You're thinking of getting involved.

16:24.520 --> 16:27.920
- Maybe.
- You check the temperature out there.

16:27.960 --> 16:30.480
People are increasingly suspicious
about foreigners.

16:30.520 --> 16:32.520
You're a foreigner!

16:32.560 --> 16:34.560
You know what I mean.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.600
Of course. Foreigners!

16:36.640 --> 16:38.640
Austrians. Jews.

16:38.680 --> 16:41.000
Not good, clean-living Americans.

16:41.040 --> 16:43.040
Wonderful, another lecture!

16:43.080 --> 16:45.880
- First Freddie and now you.
- Wait. You saw him today?

16:46.640 --> 16:48.331
Yeah, I went to the airfield.

16:48.356 --> 16:50.411
I wanted to interview
some of the pilots, you know,

16:50.436 --> 16:53.280
get out from behind my beloved
martini glass.

16:53.320 --> 16:55.040
How is he? Is he in danger?

16:55.080 --> 16:56.880
Well, they're flyboys, aren't they?

16:56.920 --> 16:58.920
What does that mean?

17:03.800 --> 17:06.440
You know, I grew up in this place...

17:06.480 --> 17:08.480
Farmersville, Illinois.

17:09.079 --> 17:11.079
Anyway, there was this kid.

17:11.119 --> 17:13.119
Danny Pacelli.

17:13.160 --> 17:16.200
He played ball, ran track.

17:16.960 --> 17:19.920
I never seen anyone so confident
in my life.

17:21.240 --> 17:23.359
Like nothing bad
could ever touch him.

17:24.480 --> 17:26.480
Freddie reminded me of him.

17:27.640 --> 17:29.640
A lot.

17:30.683 --> 17:31.862
Chef.

17:32.480 --> 17:33.720
Billy.

17:34.760 --> 17:36.760
One moment, please.

17:37.440 --> 17:39.440
Sit.

17:48.080 --> 17:51.400
Did you really think
you could get away with it?

17:52.920 --> 17:55.320
What? This is the kitchen, son!

17:55.360 --> 17:59.369
We see and hear everything.

18:01.920 --> 18:05.560
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you...

18:05.600 --> 18:09.320
You can't hide your birthday
from the Halcyon, boy!

18:09.360 --> 18:13.800
Happy birthday dear Billy.

18:13.840 --> 18:18.080
Happy birthday to you.

18:18.120 --> 18:20.120
Come on! Make a wish, come on.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.800
You tried champagne before?

18:43.440 --> 18:46.160
An example of the Barbizon School.

18:46.200 --> 18:48.600
Realism over romanticism.

18:49.320 --> 18:51.320
Lord Hamilton chose it.

18:51.360 --> 18:54.160
Though I doubt he ever gave it
a second glance.

18:55.240 --> 18:58.640
I find it dreary. Like a wet Sunday.

18:58.680 --> 19:01.360
Then why is it still here?

19:02.560 --> 19:05.600
Lady Hamilton, surely you're not
waiting for permission

19:05.640 --> 19:07.758
to make changes to your own hotel?

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Allow me.

19:14.240 --> 19:17.040
There we are.

19:17.080 --> 19:20.040
- Done.
- You are very wicked.

19:22.040 --> 19:24.040
She's doing this to provoke me.

19:24.080 --> 19:27.320
Or maybe she's just
enjoying her freedom.

19:27.360 --> 19:30.000
That woman doesn't enjoy anything.

19:30.040 --> 19:32.200
Apparently she enjoys provoking you.

19:32.240 --> 19:34.960
Mr. Garland. Er... Mrs... Mum.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Billy...

19:37.960 --> 19:39.960
When are his papers due?

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Any day now.

19:42.040 --> 19:44.040
There's nothing I can do, is there?

19:44.080 --> 19:46.080
Nothing anyone can do.

19:48.120 --> 19:50.120
Well, yeah, I do know a fella.

19:51.880 --> 19:53.880
But?

19:53.920 --> 19:55.920
Messing with call-ups...

19:55.960 --> 19:58.560
Some might say
that's a bit unpatriotic.

20:02.960 --> 20:04.960
We look after our own.

20:06.240 --> 20:08.240
I'll get in contact with him, then.

20:08.280 --> 20:10.280
Good.

20:10.320 --> 20:12.320
I'll erm...

20:12.360 --> 20:14.320
need you to keep watch tonight.

20:14.360 --> 20:17.080
We shouldn't rely on
the air raid sirens.

20:18.080 --> 20:20.080
Will I get time-and-a-half for that?

20:20.120 --> 20:22.480
I hoped you might do it
out of a sense of duty.

20:22.520 --> 20:25.320
Well, we look after our own, Mr. G.

20:27.400 --> 20:29.400
You worry too much.

20:29.440 --> 20:31.440
You know what they say?

20:31.480 --> 20:33.680
It'll all be over by Christmas.

20:35.920 --> 20:38.760
So YOU took the gun?
Shh! In here.

20:42.880 --> 20:46.720
I thought you were acting strange.
Where is it now?

20:46.760 --> 20:49.600
- I've hidden it.
- Bloody hell, Billy!

20:49.640 --> 20:51.560
I've... I've never held one before.

20:51.600 --> 20:55.000
I was gonna return it later,
when I had the chance.

20:55.040 --> 20:58.840
- Then all hell broke loose.
- Does anybody else know?

20:58.880 --> 21:00.880
No.

21:00.920 --> 21:02.920
When they do...

21:04.200 --> 21:06.200
I'm gonna lose my job.

21:06.240 --> 21:08.240
I won't be allowed in the army.

21:08.280 --> 21:10.000
God. My mum's gonna kill me.

21:10.040 --> 21:12.320
- Give it back, then.
- Yeah, and say what, though?

21:12.360 --> 21:13.960
Say nothing.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.480
Just need to put the gun somewhere
in the Count's room.

21:16.520 --> 21:19.560
Wait till he's having lunch
tomorrow, right?

21:22.280 --> 21:24.840
I'm not saying
what Max did was right.

21:27.640 --> 21:29.560
He stole from Lady Hamilton.

21:29.600 --> 21:32.000
This isn't something that can be
just washed away.

21:32.040 --> 21:34.080
But if he was trying to
help his family, then...

21:34.120 --> 21:36.480
We must be seen as united on this.

21:36.520 --> 21:38.800
Is that why you wanted me
to take this job?

21:38.840 --> 21:41.280
To have someone to blindly
back you up, no matter what?

21:41.320 --> 21:43.200
- Is that all I'm meant to be?
- Of course not.

21:43.240 --> 21:45.440
Well, then,
at least let me speak to him!

21:45.480 --> 21:48.640
- The matter is closed.
- You're forbidding me?

21:48.680 --> 21:51.800
As what? My parent? Or my superior?

21:51.840 --> 21:54.200
Both. Are we clear?

21:54.240 --> 21:58.280
Crystal, Mr. Garland.

22:18.640 --> 22:21.320
So, Mr. Hamilton's a working man now?

22:21.360 --> 22:23.160
Yes. Start next week.

22:23.200 --> 22:25.760
Can't help feeling they've made
a terrible mistake,

22:25.800 --> 22:28.322
accepting me into the War Office.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.920
- This... is confidence in a glass.
- OK.

22:33.080 --> 22:36.240
You know,
some people drink to forget.

22:36.280 --> 22:38.280
I say...

22:39.200 --> 22:41.200
drink to remember.

22:41.240 --> 22:43.240
To remember what?

22:43.280 --> 22:45.280
I don't know.

22:45.320 --> 22:50.240
Maybe that being Toby Hamilton
is something pretty special.

22:55.200 --> 22:57.200
You all right there, Toby?

22:58.760 --> 23:01.360
Not so bad, Mr. O'Hara.

23:01.400 --> 23:04.240
Bourbon on the rocks.
Make that two.

23:17.560 --> 23:20.160
- Housekeeping.
- Come.

23:28.120 --> 23:30.120
I'm sure it'll turn up.

23:31.760 --> 23:33.960
I know you must be feeling
like it won't,

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
but it's like my mam always says.

23:36.040 --> 23:38.240
Always in the last place
you look for it.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.760
Your kindness is much appreciated.

23:52.160 --> 23:55.000
My mam also says that a smile
doesn't cost anything.

23:56.280 --> 23:58.280
What is your name?

23:58.320 --> 24:01.000
Kate, sir.

24:01.040 --> 24:03.040
You...

24:03.080 --> 24:05.080
have a light.

24:06.080 --> 24:08.080
It shines from within you.

24:09.240 --> 24:11.240
A kindness.

24:11.280 --> 24:13.280
A warmth.

24:15.320 --> 24:17.320
Please.

24:17.360 --> 24:19.360
It would be of comfort.

24:41.880 --> 24:43.880
You scratched me!

24:53.920 --> 24:55.920
I opened one of Max's letters.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.760
One of the guests helped me
translate some of it.

25:02.120 --> 25:05.920
Something tells me it pulled
on the old heart strings.

25:06.600 --> 25:10.200
How would you feel if the people
you cared about were in danger,

25:10.240 --> 25:12.880
and there was so little
you could do to help them?

25:12.920 --> 25:14.920
Well, I've got a rule.

25:15.760 --> 25:17.760
Only one person I care about.

25:17.800 --> 25:19.440
Yourself?

25:19.480 --> 25:21.920
Well, actually,
I was referring to Mr. Jim Beam,

25:21.960 --> 25:23.880
but that's a good answer, too.

25:23.920 --> 25:26.360
Look, I'm making a point.

25:27.760 --> 25:29.960
You're an assistant manager
in a hotel.

25:30.760 --> 25:33.240
There's only so much you can do.

25:44.840 --> 25:46.840
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.

25:46.880 --> 25:50.280
I apologise for the interruption.

25:50.320 --> 25:53.160
The French have laid down
their arms...

25:55.440 --> 25:57.920
and asked Germany
for an armistice.

25:58.760 --> 26:00.760
It'll be signed
in the next few days,

26:00.800 --> 26:02.800
but as of now,

26:02.840 --> 26:04.960
France has effectively fallen.

26:07.040 --> 26:11.200
I am so sorry to be the bearer of...
such awful news.

26:11.240 --> 26:13.240
Thank you.

26:21.923 --> 26:24.523
It shouldn't be too long now.
Thank you so much.

26:24.563 --> 26:27.483
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,
for your patience.

26:27.523 --> 26:30.963
Britain stands alone now.
There's no-one else.

26:31.003 --> 26:35.163
We still have our army,
our ships, our air force.

26:35.203 --> 26:39.203
That kid I told you about
from my hometown, Danny Pacelli.

26:39.243 --> 26:42.163
He joins the Marines
straight after high school.

26:42.203 --> 26:44.323
He ships off to Nicaragua.

26:44.363 --> 26:46.363
Two weeks later...

26:47.123 --> 26:51.654
they send him back in a box
with a flag draped over it.

26:52.443 --> 26:56.754
He was just a kid.
But that's what they do.

26:56.779 --> 27:00.100
They send out the kids.
Like Freddie and his squad.

27:00.125 --> 27:01.790
They're more than that.
They've been trained.

27:01.814 --> 27:03.960
That won't make a difference.
They're outnumbered.

27:03.985 --> 27:04.735
Stop it.

27:04.759 --> 27:06.679
To go up against the Germans
in the sky with what they've got?

27:06.703 --> 27:08.943
- They don't stand a chance.
- I said stop it!

27:10.781 --> 27:12.661
You're not helping.

27:14.501 --> 27:16.501
All right. You wanna see Max?

27:17.741 --> 27:19.821
Well, let's go see Max.

27:30.861 --> 27:33.581
I'm sorry to be the one to tell you.

27:33.621 --> 27:36.741
What were France's
terms of surrender?

27:36.781 --> 27:38.781
We don't... we don't know yet.

27:42.461 --> 27:45.341
You must tell them to release me.
That I'm sorry.

27:45.381 --> 27:48.421
More than ever,
I must find a way to help my family.

27:48.461 --> 27:50.461
Max, you stole from the hotel.

27:50.501 --> 27:53.421
From Lady Hamilton herself.

27:53.461 --> 27:56.541
The cufflinks would have lain
in a drawer...

27:57.094 --> 27:59.094
dusty and unused.

28:00.294 --> 28:02.294
They compare us to vermin.

28:02.334 --> 28:04.334
To rats.

28:05.614 --> 28:07.694
My daughter is seven years old.

28:07.734 --> 28:10.516
And because she is Jewish...

28:11.974 --> 28:14.014
she is seen as
worse than an animal.

28:15.254 --> 28:17.254
She's not even a person.

28:20.163 --> 28:22.163
And if they have taken her...

28:24.001 --> 28:26.001
Please, Miss. Garland.

28:28.081 --> 28:30.881
You're the only hope I have.

28:32.241 --> 28:34.241
Get me out of here.

28:50.561 --> 28:52.561
I understand there was er...

28:52.601 --> 28:54.601
an incident with the Count.

28:54.641 --> 28:56.641
Best forgotten.

29:14.649 --> 29:16.961
Are you sure everything's OK?

29:17.001 --> 29:19.921
Just not seemed yourself
the last few days.

29:19.961 --> 29:22.844
Yeah, 'course I am.
Not done nothin'.

29:22.869 --> 29:25.361
'Not done anything'.

29:25.401 --> 29:27.401
Excellent.

29:27.441 --> 29:30.001
Just the man I was looking for.

29:30.041 --> 29:32.681
I believe these are
your call-up papers, Billy.

29:48.521 --> 29:50.321
Well, that's not right. They've...

29:50.361 --> 29:52.601
They've assigned me to
the Royal Artillery.

29:54.481 --> 29:57.201
Just round the bloody corner
at Hyde Park. I'm...

29:57.241 --> 30:00.481
I'm meant to be with the engineers,
out where the action is.

30:02.881 --> 30:05.001
I suppose the army has to look at

30:05.041 --> 30:07.481
how best to distribute
their resources.

30:08.401 --> 30:10.401
Why did the letter come here?

30:10.441 --> 30:12.441
Should've gone to the house.

30:14.481 --> 30:16.921
- Did you do this?
- Billy!

30:16.961 --> 30:20.281
- I promise, I don't know anything...
- I ain't a child no more.

30:29.761 --> 30:31.841
I am so sorry.

30:31.881 --> 30:33.801
I had no idea how upset he'd be.

30:35.081 --> 30:38.641
You've... nothing to be sorry about.

30:45.081 --> 30:48.281
You are officially awful!

30:48.321 --> 30:50.121
Sorry. I thought we were
supposed to be

30:50.161 --> 30:52.201
having breakfast together
this morning.

30:52.241 --> 30:54.241
There's plenty of room at the table.

30:55.721 --> 30:57.641
Mr. D'Aberville is a terrible person

30:57.681 --> 31:00.001
and I want you to ignore
everything he says.

31:00.881 --> 31:03.361
Toby does very important work
for the government.

31:03.401 --> 31:05.201
Or so he tells me.

31:05.241 --> 31:07.681
We were commiserating
over the situation in France.

31:07.721 --> 31:09.721
Well, yes.
It's most distressing.

31:09.761 --> 31:12.161
I know, I know.
I mean, where are they gonna find

31:12.201 --> 31:14.481
decent Sauerkraut in Paris?

31:21.041 --> 31:23.841
Erm... the Count's due to go
for his lunch in a bit.

31:23.881 --> 31:27.001
Gonna put the gun back then.
I just need you to keep watch.

31:27.041 --> 31:29.041
Er... I can't.

31:29.081 --> 31:31.081
I don't wanna go up there.

31:31.121 --> 31:33.921
What? Come on!
You said that you'd help me, Kate...

31:38.201 --> 31:40.201
What happened?

31:42.961 --> 31:44.961
Kate? What...

31:45.001 --> 31:47.001
He was upset.

31:48.201 --> 31:50.761
I was just being nice, but then...

31:50.801 --> 31:53.481
He wouldn't let me go, kept...

31:53.521 --> 31:55.721
pushing himself against me
and then...

31:55.761 --> 31:57.761
he kissed me.

31:57.801 --> 31:59.801
We'll erm...

32:00.801 --> 32:02.921
- We'll go and tell Mr. Garland right...
- No!

32:02.961 --> 32:04.961
Billy, don't.

32:05.001 --> 32:07.001
No-one's gonna believe me.

32:07.041 --> 32:09.041
He's the Count, and I'm...

32:09.081 --> 32:11.081
nobody.

32:11.121 --> 32:13.401
No. Don't say that. You're not.

32:13.441 --> 32:15.441
And I'm not gonna let him
do that to you.

32:15.481 --> 32:18.001
What's the point?
There's nothing you can do.

32:18.041 --> 32:20.641
Just... forget it.

32:20.681 --> 32:22.681
It doesn't matter.

32:38.561 --> 32:40.561
Young William.

32:40.601 --> 32:44.481
I believe they teach you to knock
before entering, yes?

32:46.601 --> 32:48.601
I've got your gun.

32:49.281 --> 32:51.921
That's wonderful!
Wherever did you find it?

32:56.307 --> 32:57.932
William?

32:58.761 --> 33:00.761
Hand over my property.

33:00.801 --> 33:03.441
- She felt sorry for you.
- Who?

33:03.481 --> 33:05.121
Kate! The chambermaid.

33:05.161 --> 33:08.841
There are things
you need to learn about women.

33:08.881 --> 33:11.081
What they say
and what they really want.

33:11.121 --> 33:13.921
No. I don't have to learn anything.
I'm not a child.

33:13.961 --> 33:17.241
What you did, it...
it was wrong and...

33:17.281 --> 33:19.321
- You like her.
- No. It's not about that.

33:19.361 --> 33:22.841
Maybe you are angry
because she wanted a man.

33:22.881 --> 33:25.521
Not a pathetic, mewling baby,

33:25.561 --> 33:28.521
one who shivers and shakes
with fear.

33:28.561 --> 33:30.561
Now, give me what is mine!

33:57.800 --> 33:59.800
This place is meant to be secure.

33:59.840 --> 34:01.840
An oasis from the outside world.

34:01.880 --> 34:03.880
And what do you do?
You threaten a guest.

34:03.920 --> 34:05.960
A count, for God's sake,

34:06.000 --> 34:08.280
with his own gun
that you stole from him!

34:09.760 --> 34:11.760
If word of this gets out...

34:19.040 --> 34:21.040
It's Kate.

34:21.960 --> 34:23.960
What?

34:26.080 --> 34:28.560
What about Kate?

34:28.600 --> 34:31.840
Now, I have no wish to shame her,
but...

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
to be threatened like that
by the boy?

34:35.960 --> 34:38.320
No. That shall not stand.

34:39.520 --> 34:41.520
I want him arrested.

34:41.560 --> 34:44.920
And I want financial restitution.

34:49.280 --> 34:51.760
More and more royalty are fleeing
Europe every day.

34:51.800 --> 34:54.920
We want them to know that
the Halcyon is their safe haven,

34:54.960 --> 34:56.960
a place they will be taken care of.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.840
Do you feel he acted
inappropriately?

34:59.880 --> 35:01.880
He's a titled man!

35:01.920 --> 35:04.920
Do you feel he acted
inappropriately?

35:06.760 --> 35:11.320
I feel that he disrespected me
and he disrespected my hotel.

35:11.360 --> 35:14.440
Then may I have a free hand
to deal with him as I see fit?

35:14.480 --> 35:16.600
As long as there are
no repercussions.

35:16.640 --> 35:18.640
I'm glad we can work together.

35:18.680 --> 35:22.080
Mr. Garland, you will be
getting your hands dirty,

35:22.120 --> 35:25.200
whilst mine remain
sparkling and clean.

35:29.280 --> 35:31.280
Before he came here,

35:31.320 --> 35:36.920
the Count stayed at both
the Dorchester and the Savoy.

35:37.963 --> 35:42.323
Seems odd that he'd change hotels
twice in eight days.

35:42.363 --> 35:44.843
Well, he is very particular.

35:47.763 --> 35:49.803
The incident with our chambermaid...

35:50.803 --> 35:53.683
It isn't the first time
this has happened, is it?

35:54.603 --> 35:56.363
He won't back down from his demands.

35:56.403 --> 35:58.443
Because he thinks
we won't go public with this.

35:58.483 --> 36:01.083
You wouldn't betray the
confidentiality of your guests.

36:01.123 --> 36:04.203
- Nobody would ever stay here again.
- You're right. We wouldn't.

36:04.243 --> 36:06.643
But there is an American.

36:06.683 --> 36:08.683
Mr. O'Hara.

36:08.723 --> 36:10.723
Journalist.

36:10.763 --> 36:12.683
Quite popular on the wireless.

36:12.723 --> 36:15.003
Always on the lookout for a story.

36:18.563 --> 36:21.123
I would hate to see your name
dragged into this.

36:25.323 --> 36:28.203
Well, I could explain it to him

36:28.243 --> 36:31.363
in a way that would
make him go quietly.

36:31.403 --> 36:33.683
And what would you want in return?

36:35.763 --> 36:38.563
Well, the Count left
a sizeable deposit for his suite.

36:38.603 --> 36:41.243
I'd like to use it for
a more modest room for myself.

36:41.283 --> 36:43.643
You're leaving his service?

36:43.683 --> 36:46.563
War tends to put things
into perspective.

36:49.323 --> 36:52.763
So, how are you finding
your new position?

36:52.803 --> 36:54.563
It's a challenge,

36:54.603 --> 36:56.883
but I feel I'm starting
to get to grips with it.

36:56.923 --> 36:59.163
Of course, you're totally
unsuited to the job.

37:01.243 --> 37:04.803
I don't say it to be cruel.
You're too soft around the edges.

37:04.843 --> 37:06.843
Your father...

37:06.883 --> 37:08.883
even with all his faults,

37:08.923 --> 37:10.963
isn't afraid to make enemies.

37:13.723 --> 37:16.963
So, now would be the wrong time
to talk to you about Mr. Klein?

37:17.003 --> 37:20.323
- He's the kitchen porter...
- The Austrian who stole from me.

37:21.643 --> 37:24.283
Yes, I know who Herr Klein is.

37:25.803 --> 37:28.123
He has a family in France.

37:28.163 --> 37:30.163
A wife. A daughter.

37:31.243 --> 37:33.243
What he did was wrong, but...

37:34.643 --> 37:36.643
he was desperate.

37:36.683 --> 37:38.683
And you want me to forgive him?

37:40.283 --> 37:42.283
To allow him to return?

37:45.283 --> 37:47.283
Why on earth would I do that?

37:51.443 --> 37:53.443
Because my father is against it.

38:16.003 --> 38:18.683
Waiting for someone?

38:19.963 --> 38:21.963
I made a decision about Mr. Klein.

38:22.003 --> 38:23.963
You went behind my back.

38:26.403 --> 38:28.403
Clever.

38:28.443 --> 38:31.203
Using me as leverage
with her Ladyship.

38:31.243 --> 38:33.243
I wouldn't have thought of that.

38:34.483 --> 38:36.483
Are you angry?

38:36.523 --> 38:39.443
- You undermined me.
- I couldn't think of any other way.

38:39.483 --> 38:42.963
As your manager,
I am not happy at all.

38:44.523 --> 38:46.523
As your father...

38:48.563 --> 38:50.563
I'm a little impressed.

38:50.603 --> 38:52.603
Proud, even.

38:53.563 --> 38:55.563
- But angry.
- Exactly.

39:03.392 --> 39:04.641
Mr. Klein.

39:04.666 --> 39:06.083
Mr. Garland.

39:06.123 --> 39:08.603
You're late for work.

39:08.643 --> 39:11.723
Please stop by my office later.

39:11.763 --> 39:15.723
We'll discuss how we can try
to locate your family.

39:19.643 --> 39:22.443
- Thank you.
- Yes, yes. No need for that.

39:22.483 --> 39:26.963
Miss. Garland has shown
great support for you.

39:27.003 --> 39:29.003
Please don't let her down.

39:29.043 --> 39:31.043
Of course, sir.

39:52.483 --> 39:54.483
You can do that again.

39:59.523 --> 40:01.523
No.

40:01.563 --> 40:03.563
No.

40:03.603 --> 40:07.163
That thieving piece of shit
is not working in my kitchen.

40:07.203 --> 40:08.963
Mr. Klein is rejoining us.

40:09.003 --> 40:12.043
I'm not discussing this
with the bloody receptionist.

40:12.083 --> 40:14.083
I fought in the Great War.

40:15.643 --> 40:17.643
We thought that was it.

40:17.683 --> 40:19.683
But it isn't, is it?

40:19.723 --> 40:21.803
It's starting all over again.

40:21.843 --> 40:23.843
I appreciate that.

40:23.883 --> 40:26.443
But I believe we must be measured
by our compassion

40:26.483 --> 40:28.323
and not our suspicion or fear.

40:28.363 --> 40:31.163
I don't give a fig what you believe,
Garland.

40:31.203 --> 40:33.203
This is not a negotiation.

40:33.243 --> 40:35.363
It's him or me.

40:36.923 --> 40:38.923
Are you sure you want to do this?

40:38.963 --> 40:40.963
Chef, er... maybe let it lie?

40:45.643 --> 40:47.643
Very well.

40:47.683 --> 40:49.683
Miss. Garland.

40:49.723 --> 40:53.123
I leave this situation
in your capable hands.

40:57.843 --> 40:59.843
I apologise, Mr. Parry.

41:01.803 --> 41:04.043
You've left me with little choice.

41:04.083 --> 41:05.883
Please clear out your locker.

41:05.923 --> 41:07.923
Robbie.

41:07.963 --> 41:09.963
The head chef station is yours.

41:10.003 --> 41:12.003
Mr. Klein.

41:12.043 --> 41:14.043
Sous chef.

41:14.083 --> 41:16.123
If that meets with
Robbie's approval?

41:16.163 --> 41:18.163
Y-yeah.

41:35.643 --> 41:37.643
I'll try and get some.

41:37.683 --> 41:39.683
Here we go.

41:41.923 --> 41:44.083
What? What is it?

41:46.963 --> 41:48.963
Take her away.

41:53.043 --> 41:55.043
Pick it up.

41:55.083 --> 41:57.083
Pick it up!

41:57.123 --> 42:00.003
You've got knees. Do it yourself.

42:00.043 --> 42:02.203
Your Excellency.

42:02.243 --> 42:05.243
I'm so sorry to hear about
your premature departure.

42:07.123 --> 42:10.363
England is finished, Mr. Garland.

42:10.403 --> 42:13.963
Soon your hotel will be little more
than rubble and dust.

42:21.403 --> 42:23.403
We can't put a stage in here.

42:23.443 --> 42:26.843
We'll need something.
I've gotta have space to perform.

42:26.883 --> 42:29.443
Especially if we keep ending up
down here.

42:29.483 --> 42:32.483
Couldn't you just lie
on top of the piano or something?

42:32.523 --> 42:35.283
- That might work.
- No! That was a joke.

42:35.323 --> 42:37.323
I don't know. It could be good.

42:38.500 --> 42:39.609
See?

42:40.003 --> 42:42.003
The big boss agrees with me.

42:44.683 --> 42:46.803
Break her heart,
I'll break your face.

42:46.843 --> 42:49.736
Lovely to have you back,
Lord Hamilton.

42:55.043 --> 42:57.043
How are you?

42:57.083 --> 42:59.803
I've... I've only got an hour.

42:59.843 --> 43:01.843
But I just...

43:01.883 --> 43:03.763
I needed to see you.

43:03.803 --> 43:05.803
What is it? What's happened?

43:10.483 --> 43:12.483
I couldn't make a difference.

43:14.043 --> 43:16.323
They came out of the sun.

43:19.803 --> 43:22.123
And they just opened up
their machine guns

43:22.163 --> 43:24.163
on the survivors in the water.

43:26.083 --> 43:28.083
We...

43:28.123 --> 43:30.443
We just couldn't stop them.

43:31.923 --> 43:33.843
But you'll keep trying.

43:33.883 --> 43:36.323
I don't know what's going to
happen to us all, but...

43:36.363 --> 43:39.769
there's something I've been
wanting to do for a long time.

43:47.923 --> 43:49.923
Was that it?

43:49.963 --> 43:53.438
I'm hoping it was,
because otherwise...

44:05.163 --> 44:07.163
'Everything is changing.

44:07.203 --> 44:09.443
You can feel it in the air.

44:09.483 --> 44:11.483
As I pass through London,

44:11.523 --> 44:14.283
I see it on the faces
of the men and women around me.

44:14.323 --> 44:16.323
Things are different.

44:16.363 --> 44:21.003
Now that France has fallen,
Britain is next in line.

44:21.043 --> 44:23.603
But I don't think
that means they're finished.

44:23.643 --> 44:25.643
Not by a long shot.

44:25.683 --> 44:30.341
They might be scared,
but they won't let fear win the day.

44:30.923 --> 44:33.523
That's the thing I'm learning
about the Brits.

44:33.563 --> 44:37.723
That they know how to make the best
of a bad situation.

44:37.763 --> 44:39.763
They'll pull together.

44:39.803 --> 44:41.603
They'll look out for each other

44:41.643 --> 44:44.083
and they'll surprise themselves
along the way.'

44:46.163 --> 44:48.203
'I don't think it'll be easy,

44:48.243 --> 44:50.523
and I don't envy those
on the front line.

44:50.563 --> 44:52.603
But I know this.

44:52.643 --> 44:55.883
Whatever the coming days and weeks
may bring...

44:57.003 --> 44:59.003
- they'll do their best...'
- Ready.

44:59.043 --> 45:01.243
'...to their very last breath.'

45:08.043 --> 45:10.043
For the people of Britain...

45:12.083 --> 45:15.923
the war is finally coming home.
