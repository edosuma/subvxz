[instrumental music]

00:19.758 --> 00:22.631
[music continues]

00:24.328 --> 00:26.287
He's from the A.G.'s office.
We're catching a hot one.

00:26.374 --> 00:27.636
Hooray!

00:27.723 --> 00:28.985
I was about to
go mad with boredom.

00:29.072 --> 00:31.031
Don't say "Hooray".
Someone's died.

00:31.118 --> 00:33.033
[Jane]
'Well, if they have'

00:33.120 --> 00:34.686
my happiness makes
no difference to them.

00:34.773 --> 00:36.688
Nor does catching the killer,
for that matter.

00:36.775 --> 00:39.909
True, but it makes
a difference to the killer.

00:39.996 --> 00:42.738
This e-mail just came to
the attorney general's office

00:42.825 --> 00:44.609
and the governor's office
20 minutes ago.

00:44.696 --> 00:46.046
"Pay attention.

00:46.133 --> 00:48.222
"At exactly 11:05 A.M. today

00:48.309 --> 00:50.572
"at 35.04 North

00:50.659 --> 00:53.879

and greedy person

"punished with death

'and you will know
I'm serious."'

00:59.581 --> 01:01.322
Signed, "Joe Q. Public."

01:01.409 --> 01:03.454
- Interesting.
- It's probably nothing.

01:03.541 --> 01:05.630
So why can't the local
police handle it then?

01:05.717 --> 01:07.415
Some fool let the governor
read the damn thing.

01:07.502 --> 01:10.374
So he talks to the A.G.,
the A.G. talks to Minelli

01:10.461 --> 01:12.768
and Minelli tells me we
have to handle it personally.

01:12.855 --> 01:14.639
Rigsby, you're
the fastest driver.

01:14.726 --> 01:16.902
'If we leave now and push it,
we can get there by 11:05.'

01:16.989 --> 01:17.947
Where is it?

01:18.034 --> 01:20.384
Mojave desert, middle of nowhere

01:20.471 --> 01:21.646
quarter of a mile
off the highway.

01:21.733 --> 01:23.518
- Interesting.
- Boring.

01:23.605 --> 01:24.867
Three hours away.

01:24.954 --> 01:26.434
Desert's beautiful
this time of year.

01:28.653 --> 01:29.741
Let's all go.

01:32.353 --> 01:33.658
We can bring a picnic lunch.

01:39.273 --> 01:40.578
Someone has to stay
and answer the phones.

01:52.851 --> 01:55.767
[dramatic music]

01:59.206 --> 02:00.381
How much further?

02:00.468 --> 02:01.686
About 50 feet.

02:03.514 --> 02:05.908
Look at that.
Look what I found.

02:05.995 --> 02:07.649
What is it?

02:07.736 --> 02:09.346
It's a worm.

02:09.433 --> 02:11.261
It's a fossilized worm.

02:11.348 --> 02:12.567
I'm happy for you.

02:14.177 --> 02:15.831
Yeah, this is it.
This is the spot.

02:17.485 --> 02:21.532
11:04 and change,
right on time.

02:21.619 --> 02:23.882
- For what?
- There's still 15 seconds.

02:23.969 --> 02:25.710
You know, when
this worm was alive

02:25.797 --> 02:28.626
this whole desert was
the floor of a great sea.

02:28.713 --> 02:30.802
There were dinosaurs
swimming above us.

02:30.889 --> 02:32.761
- That is kinda awesome.
- Yeah.

02:34.241 --> 02:35.807
Sharks the size of buses

02:35.894 --> 02:37.244
brilliantly colored
sea monsters.

02:37.331 --> 02:39.159
Those mountains..

02:39.246 --> 02:41.248
...they would've
been volcanoes.

02:41.335 --> 02:42.901
This is a goat turd
about six months old.

02:45.513 --> 02:48.907
Still giant sharks here.

02:51.083 --> 02:52.694
Okay, we've done our job.

02:52.781 --> 02:54.043
Somebody yanked
our chain pretty good.

02:54.130 --> 02:55.653
- Let's go.
- Wait.

02:55.740 --> 02:57.829
I think we should wait.

02:57.916 --> 02:59.918
What for?
What could possibly happen?

03:00.005 --> 03:01.529
I have no idea

03:01.616 --> 03:03.618
but it's a pleasant spot
and I have sandwiches.

03:03.705 --> 03:05.663
We'll eat 'em in the car.
We've wasted enough time.

03:05.750 --> 03:08.753
[screaming]
Hey, did you hear that?

03:08.840 --> 03:11.234
- Yeah.
- What is that?

03:11.321 --> 03:12.844
[fluttering]

03:19.590 --> 03:22.680

'Yeah, our victim's name
is David Whittaker'

03:32.777 --> 03:34.301

six casual skydivers'

03:34.388 --> 03:36.085
'that went up with
an instructor this morning.'

'All executives of a company
called Carnelian Prime Trust'

03:39.436 --> 03:41.395
'out here on an outdoor
adventure retreat.'

03:41.482 --> 03:44.398
Yeah, our victim was
V.P. of human resources.

03:44.485 --> 03:47.270
David Whittaker,
Carnelian Prime Trust.

03:47.357 --> 03:48.967
Got it.
I'll start digging.

03:51.274 --> 03:52.493
You see that right there?

03:52.580 --> 03:53.972
That's the master strap, okay?

03:54.059 --> 03:56.497
And it was cut
nearly clean through.

03:56.584 --> 03:58.890
Now that has to be
deliberate and that is evil.

03:58.977 --> 04:00.849
'Cause the minute
this thing deployed

04:00.936 --> 04:02.938
the chute would've
come clean off.

04:03.025 --> 04:05.897
- Who rigged the chute?
- Me. I did.

04:05.984 --> 04:08.291
Last night and I double
checked every one of 'em.

04:08.378 --> 04:10.598
They were A-okay.
I guarantee it.

04:10.685 --> 04:11.903
This was done after.

04:11.990 --> 04:13.818
By someone that
knows parachutes.

04:13.905 --> 04:15.559
Yes.

04:15.646 --> 04:16.995
I've been rigging
chutes for 15 years

04:17.082 --> 04:18.954
and I've never had
one accident, not one.

04:19.041 --> 04:21.522
- Never.
- There's a number on there.

04:21.609 --> 04:24.742
Is there any way to identify
which chute is for which jumper?

04:24.829 --> 04:26.657
Are they assigned
to individuals?

04:26.744 --> 04:29.573
I just tell the jumpers to grab
the first chute they come to.

04:29.660 --> 04:32.663
Those numbers are strictly
for the maintenance logs.

04:32.750 --> 04:34.491
Well, who had access to the
chutes after you rigged them?

04:34.578 --> 04:36.276
They're just,
they're in the hangar overnight

04:36.363 --> 04:37.755
not locked or anything.

04:37.842 --> 04:40.628
So anyone who had access
to the airport, basically.

[Rand Faulk]
'Agent Lisbon, is it?'

04:42.978 --> 04:45.067
We're leaving.
Keep my office informed.

04:45.154 --> 04:46.764
And you, you'll be hearing
from our lawyers.

04:46.851 --> 04:48.462
Do it now.

04:48.549 --> 04:49.767
Gonna let him
get away with that?

04:49.854 --> 04:50.942
Shh.

04:51.029 --> 04:53.467
- Mr. Faulk?
- Hold on.

04:53.554 --> 04:55.817
This is a murder
investigation.

04:55.904 --> 04:58.254
You can't leave until
we say you can leave.

05:00.169 --> 05:01.736
I apologize.

05:01.823 --> 05:03.303
I thought we had answered
all your questions.

05:06.393 --> 05:08.699
Do we have your permission
to leave, Agent Lisbon?

05:08.786 --> 05:10.179
Yes, you do,
but we're gonna have a lot

05:10.266 --> 05:11.267
of follow-up questions.

05:11.354 --> 05:13.835
You know our location.

05:13.922 --> 05:15.184
Yes, we do.

05:15.271 --> 05:16.707
We'll be in touch,
Mr. Faulk.

05:26.761 --> 05:28.197
Why isn't the body
on the move yet?

05:28.284 --> 05:30.112
Forensics is still
working the scene.

05:30.199 --> 05:31.331
He fell from the sky.

05:31.418 --> 05:32.984
What could they
work on for an hour?

05:33.071 --> 05:34.551
Nerds, they won't
be hurried.

05:36.858 --> 05:39.469
'So who is this
Randall Faulk guy?'

05:39.556 --> 05:42.167

of Carnelian Prime Trust.

05:43.299 --> 05:44.561
'They're one of the top ten'

'private equity firms
in the world.'

05:45.954 --> 05:48.391
'They buy and
sell big companies.'

05:48.478 --> 05:51.307
Oil, steel, auto plants,
hotel chains.

05:51.394 --> 05:53.831
- You name it, they own it.
- Uh-huh. Rich bastards.

05:53.918 --> 05:56.268
As soon as the scene's clear,
you two go to the airport.

05:56.356 --> 05:59.663
'Find out who had access to
the parachutes last night.'

05:59.750 --> 06:01.361
'And find out about
Spruell's history.'

06:01.448 --> 06:03.928
- 'See if anything bumps.'
- Yeah, you got it, boss.

06:04.015 --> 06:06.844
[cell phone ringing]

06:06.931 --> 06:07.976
Van Pelt, what's up?

06:08.063 --> 06:12.763
- Are you close to a TV?
- No, why?

06:12.850 --> 06:15.157
Oh, hell.

06:15.244 --> 06:16.898
Want your sandwich?

06:27.778 --> 06:29.432
Help you?

06:29.519 --> 06:31.042
We're looking
for Mr. Faulk.

06:31.129 --> 06:32.566
- Right up in the house.
- Thank you.

Thanks.

the past hour to the police'

change its ways."

Yours truly, "Joe Q. Public."

07:01.333 --> 07:04.249
- Illiterate nonsense.
- Perhaps.

07:04.336 --> 07:06.556
But the threat to
your lives is explicit.

07:06.643 --> 07:07.775
We need to set up
a security plan

with the marshal's services.

07:09.559 --> 07:10.908
What time are you planning
on going back to the city?

07:12.475 --> 07:15.173
We're not.
We're staying here.

07:15.260 --> 07:16.566
We're continuing the retreat.

07:16.653 --> 07:18.481
Oh, for God's sake, Rand.

07:18.568 --> 07:20.918
'Perhaps there are other
considerations here?'

07:21.005 --> 07:23.704
I'm not sure staying here is the
most advisable safety posture.

07:23.791 --> 07:24.922
We stay.

07:25.009 --> 07:27.055
I'm not letting some random

07:27.142 --> 07:29.361
lunatic disturb Carnelian.

07:29.449 --> 07:30.624
'This is a test
of our strength.'

07:30.711 --> 07:32.408
David would want us
to continue.

07:32.495 --> 07:34.323
Yes, he would.
Yes, he would.

07:34.410 --> 07:36.151
David would never back down.

07:36.238 --> 07:38.283
David wouldn't want you
to respectfully acknowledge

07:38.370 --> 07:40.982
his tragic
and untimely death?

07:41.069 --> 07:44.289
Oh, okay, he-he wouldn't
want it to interfere

07:44.376 --> 07:45.421
with your kayaking schedule.

07:49.469 --> 07:52.646
- Joan, is it?
- Jane, like the girl.

07:52.733 --> 07:55.387
- Jane.
- Mr. Jane.

07:56.911 --> 07:59.391
- Mr. Jane.
- Thank you.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.481
This week that we spent here
is not a vacation.

08:01.568 --> 08:03.526
This is a test.

08:03.613 --> 08:05.267
What we learn here
about ourselves

08:05.354 --> 08:07.356
and about each other is
at the core of the philosophy

08:07.443 --> 08:09.967
'of Carnelian's success.'

08:10.054 --> 08:12.361
Now there will come
an appropriate moment

08:12.448 --> 08:15.103
to mourn our dear friend.

08:15.190 --> 08:17.975
'This is the moment to
show resolve and courage.'

08:20.935 --> 08:24.286
And now perhaps you can give us
a briefing on the case so far.

08:24.373 --> 08:27.158
We investigate murders.
We don't give briefings.

08:27.245 --> 08:29.770
Why on earth not?
We have the right to know.

08:29.857 --> 08:31.249
We're the victims here.

08:31.336 --> 08:32.729
David Whittaker is
the victim here.

08:32.816 --> 08:34.775
Any one of us could've
picked that bad chute.

08:34.862 --> 08:36.516
Any one of us could
be dead right now.

08:36.603 --> 08:39.257
Yes, but the saboteur didn't
know which one of you would die.

08:39.344 --> 08:42.260
'He felt that any one
of you would fit the bill.'

08:43.610 --> 08:46.090
"Greedy and arrogant."

08:46.177 --> 08:49.529
- How does that make you feel?
- Is this group therapy?

08:49.616 --> 08:51.487
- You want group therapy?
- 'No.'

08:51.574 --> 08:54.534
We want a professional
police detective.

08:54.621 --> 08:56.013
I will be speaking
with your superiors

08:56.100 --> 08:58.146
'just to assure myself
that your people'

08:58.233 --> 08:59.539
'are the best option
going forward.'

08:59.626 --> 09:01.018
That's a good
assurance to get.

09:01.105 --> 09:03.847
Quick question,
what is the worst thing

09:03.934 --> 09:05.022
you people have done lately?

09:07.242 --> 09:09.461
We control assets
of over $50 billion.

09:09.549 --> 09:12.421
Our companies employ
over half a million people.

09:12.508 --> 09:14.597
In the last six months, the way
the economy has been going

09:14.684 --> 09:15.903
I've been forced to put

09:15.990 --> 09:17.557
'about 50,000 men
and women out of work.'

09:17.644 --> 09:19.428
Now some of them
will blame Carnelian

09:19.515 --> 09:22.126
for their misfortunes, I'm sure.
It's understandable.

09:22.213 --> 09:25.260
- Does that bother you?
- It most certainly does.

09:25.347 --> 09:28.219
I'm concerned about security
just like anyone else.

09:28.306 --> 09:30.004
I don't consider
myself bulletproof.

09:30.091 --> 09:31.571
That's not what I meant.

09:31.658 --> 09:32.615
I meant, does it bother you
that these people

09:32.702 --> 09:34.138
are out of work
on your say-so?

09:34.225 --> 09:36.053
No.

09:36.140 --> 09:38.969
That's my job,
to make the tough decisions.

09:39.056 --> 09:41.711
Tough, yet rational
and ethical.

09:41.798 --> 09:45.585
And, yes, I'm afraid people
will suffer because of it.

09:45.672 --> 09:46.977
So it's no surprise
that someone's making

09:47.064 --> 09:48.370
a stand against you?

09:48.457 --> 09:51.416
No, there's always
malcontents amongst us.

09:51.503 --> 09:52.853
I'll send you our register.

09:52.940 --> 09:55.116
Oh, you have a register
of malcontents?

09:55.203 --> 09:57.161
Anyone who's ever sued us
or threatened to sue us

09:57.248 --> 09:59.163
or written hostile letters,
that sort of thing

09:59.250 --> 10:00.512
get logged
in the register.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.384
It'd be good for us
to take a look at that.

10:02.471 --> 10:03.864
Yeah.

10:07.519 --> 10:09.478
[Rigsby]
'We'd like a list of everyone
with an airport security pass.'

10:09.565 --> 10:10.914
Do you have a warrant?

10:11.001 --> 10:12.437
It's not privileged
information, ma'am.

10:12.524 --> 10:14.048
You can give it to us
without prejudice.

10:14.135 --> 10:17.181
- Well, okay, if you're sure.
- Yeah, I'm sure.

10:17.268 --> 10:19.619
If you could, uh, send it
to that address, please?

10:22.230 --> 10:24.580
Hi, you'll be getting
the airport list any second now.

10:24.667 --> 10:29.106
Okay.
Got it.

10:29.193 --> 10:31.021
I'll crosscheck it against
the Carnelian list.

10:38.028 --> 10:39.464
One name on both lists..

10:39.551 --> 10:40.857
'...Lee Skelling.'

10:40.944 --> 10:42.859
Lee Skelling?

10:42.946 --> 10:45.122
Yeah, he works the baggage truck
a couple days a week.

10:45.209 --> 10:46.515
'He's not here today.'

10:46.602 --> 10:47.995
- Okay, thank you.
- Thank you.

10:48.082 --> 10:50.084
- Thanks, Van Pelt.
- Yep.

10:52.608 --> 10:55.872
Sniveling lackey pigs is
what you are, you know that?

10:55.959 --> 10:57.657
- Damn lackeys!
- Calm down, Lee.

10:57.744 --> 10:58.745
Make me.

10:58.832 --> 11:00.224
'Stop right there!'

11:00.311 --> 11:01.661
You let him go right now,
you hear me?

11:01.748 --> 11:04.141
It's not loaded!

11:04.228 --> 11:07.797
Now you put that down
right now, you idiot.

11:07.884 --> 11:09.712
- But, daddy!
- Get inside, boy.

11:16.980 --> 11:18.678
Scared the pants off you,
didn't he?

11:18.765 --> 11:19.722
Yeah, he did.

11:21.332 --> 11:22.420
No, he didn't.

11:30.341 --> 11:31.212
[Cho]
'Two years ago,
you sent this letter'

11:31.299 --> 11:32.996
'to Carnelian headquarters.'

11:33.083 --> 11:34.781
"You greedy sons of bitches
ought to know better than to

11:34.868 --> 11:37.087
"outright steal from decent
American citizens like myself.

11:37.174 --> 11:39.437
'"You're no better
than scum in my book.'

11:39.524 --> 11:42.049
You better pay up, or there's
gonna be consequences."

11:42.136 --> 11:43.180
You recall writing
this letter?

11:43.267 --> 11:44.921
Yes, I do.

11:45.008 --> 11:46.053
Tell me about it.

11:46.140 --> 11:47.750
Like the letter says

11:47.837 --> 11:50.971
which I wrote in
a moment of anger.

11:51.058 --> 11:52.973
They stole from me..

11:53.060 --> 11:55.410
...from my family.

11:55.497 --> 11:57.412
Then when I called them on it,
they not only didn't pay me

11:57.499 --> 11:59.675
they did their damnedest
to throw me in jail.

11:59.762 --> 12:01.198
How'd they steal from you?

12:01.285 --> 12:03.592
I used to work the line
at Grant Aerospace.

12:03.679 --> 12:05.942
Fan ducts for airliners.

12:06.029 --> 12:08.423
They had a whole
incentive thing going.

12:08.510 --> 12:10.686
If a shop floor guy
comes up with an idea

12:10.773 --> 12:13.515
that saves costs or speeds
the line, he gets a bonus.

12:13.602 --> 12:15.778
Fifty thousand dollars.

12:15.865 --> 12:17.867
So I came up with an
improvement on the riveting gear

12:17.954 --> 12:20.522
that saved them five
and a half cents per unit.

12:20.609 --> 12:22.263
That's huge.

12:22.350 --> 12:25.135
- So 50,000 for me, right?
- That's a lot of money.

12:25.222 --> 12:27.659
The C.E.O. shook my hand.

12:27.747 --> 12:30.140
I had it in writing.

12:30.227 --> 12:33.491
Then Carnelian Prime
buys Grant Aerospace.

12:33.578 --> 12:35.798
Come time to pay
my bonus, they welsh.

12:35.885 --> 12:38.583
I complained about it.
They sacked me.

12:38.670 --> 12:40.281
What'd you do then?

12:40.368 --> 12:43.197
Oh, I tried to
take them to court.

12:43.284 --> 12:45.373
Me and one old, cross-eyed
lawyer out of the phone book

12:45.460 --> 12:47.549
against 20 Ivy League weasels.

12:47.636 --> 12:49.290
'No contest.'

12:49.377 --> 12:51.031
I didn't even get a hearing.

12:51.118 --> 12:52.902
Sounds like a bad
injustice was done.

12:52.989 --> 12:54.164
Sounds like you have
a right to be angry.

12:54.251 --> 12:56.036
Yes, I do.

12:56.123 --> 12:57.385
I do have a right.

13:09.789 --> 13:10.746
Your friends already took Lee.

13:10.833 --> 13:13.270
What do you want?

13:13.357 --> 13:15.620
- Jessie Skelling?
- No, I'm Cindy Crawford.

13:17.231 --> 13:18.928
Jessie's on vacation
to Mexico.

13:33.769 --> 13:35.423
Ma'am?

13:35.510 --> 13:36.467
I can't even look at you people.

13:36.554 --> 13:39.122
'You make me so mad.'

13:39.209 --> 13:41.516
Lee's done nothing.
Nothing!

13:41.603 --> 13:43.170
Jessie, if your
husband is innocent

13:43.257 --> 13:44.780
we're your best friends.

13:44.867 --> 13:46.173
We'll prove he's innocent.

13:50.438 --> 13:51.352
Will you help us?

13:55.182 --> 13:57.227
You want some water
or a soda?

13:57.314 --> 13:59.273
Some water sounds lovely.

13:59.360 --> 14:01.014
Where were you
the night before last

14:01.101 --> 14:02.667
from 9:00 P.M. till
9:00 the next morning?

14:02.754 --> 14:05.192
I was at work
and then I was at home.

14:05.279 --> 14:07.672
- At work at the airport?
- Yes.

14:07.759 --> 14:10.588
And, yes, I could've
gotten into Spruell's hangar

14:10.675 --> 14:12.416
and messed with
that parachute.

14:12.503 --> 14:14.288
But I didn't.
Okay?

14:14.375 --> 14:16.594
I worked my shift,
I went home

14:16.681 --> 14:18.553
and that's all I did.

14:18.640 --> 14:19.902
I didn't even know
those Carnelian people

14:19.989 --> 14:21.773
were out there
jumping that day.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.515
And you know what? I wouldn't
give a damn even if I did know.

14:24.602 --> 14:25.560
No?

14:27.910 --> 14:29.607
Okay, yeah,
I would give a damn.

14:29.694 --> 14:31.914
They could give me
that money.

14:32.001 --> 14:35.744
It was peanuts to them.
Nothing.

14:35.831 --> 14:38.616
Cut a man's chute?

14:38.703 --> 14:40.053
No.

14:40.140 --> 14:41.184
Four years
with the rangers.

14:41.271 --> 14:43.273
You're familiar
with parachutes.

14:43.360 --> 14:44.884
Yes, I am.

14:44.971 --> 14:47.060
You ever been in
the military, Cho?

14:47.147 --> 14:50.411
- Yes.
- Then you know.

14:50.498 --> 14:53.196
I would chop a man's head off
and pee down his neck

14:53.283 --> 14:56.373
before I'd ever
cut his chute that way.

14:56.460 --> 14:58.854
I mean..

14:58.941 --> 15:00.116
...that's bad.

15:02.075 --> 15:03.467
That's out there.

15:05.687 --> 15:08.603
Lee is a God-fearing man.

15:08.690 --> 15:10.692
He wouldn't kill
somebody like that.

15:10.779 --> 15:12.563
- No way.
- He was a soldier.

15:12.650 --> 15:15.088
- He can kill.
- For his country.

15:15.175 --> 15:17.394
Not for himself.

15:17.481 --> 15:19.309
What's the difference,
you think?

15:19.396 --> 15:21.485
I don't know, but it makes all
the difference in the world.

15:21.572 --> 15:24.706
You're very confident
of his innocence.

15:24.793 --> 15:26.316
How can you be so sure?

15:28.710 --> 15:30.016
Cause I asked him
if he did it

15:30.103 --> 15:31.147
and he said, no,
he didn't do it.

15:31.234 --> 15:32.627
[Jane]
'Ah..'

15:32.714 --> 15:35.717
You suspected he might
indeed have done it.

15:35.804 --> 15:37.153
But he denied it.
You believe him.

15:37.240 --> 15:39.547
Lee don't lie to me.

15:39.634 --> 15:41.723
He'll cause me trouble
and grief a hundred which ways

15:41.810 --> 15:44.595
but he don't lie to me.

15:44.682 --> 15:47.511
Wives often say that
about their husbands.

15:47.598 --> 15:50.340
Easy to fool yourself that
the people you love are honest.

15:52.255 --> 15:53.300
Yeah, it is.

15:54.866 --> 15:56.781
But I know he wouldn't lie.

15:56.868 --> 15:58.740
- Why?
- Because..

16:00.785 --> 16:02.962
- Why?
- Because I'm dyin'.

16:06.617 --> 16:08.054
And he wouldn't want
to lie to somebody

16:08.141 --> 16:09.838
who's gonna sit next to
the almighty pretty soon.

16:12.928 --> 16:13.929
I'm sorry.

16:15.409 --> 16:17.063
Stuff happens.
Don't worry about it.

16:20.675 --> 16:22.633
The night before last,
what time did Lee get home?

16:22.720 --> 16:25.593
Same time as every night.
About half past midnight.

16:28.030 --> 16:28.988
Um..

16:33.166 --> 16:34.950
...yeah.

16:40.216 --> 16:42.740
My husband did not
do this thing.

16:42.827 --> 16:44.612
If he went to jail,
what would happen to the kids?

16:47.310 --> 16:48.790
They'd go into care.

16:51.227 --> 16:52.620
And he wouldn't
do that to me.

16:55.579 --> 16:56.711
He wouldn't.

16:58.756 --> 16:59.757
Thank you for your time.

17:04.110 --> 17:06.199
[Jane]
'Your wife said you wouldn't
do that to her.'

17:06.286 --> 17:08.201
I don't know.

17:08.288 --> 17:12.161
Maybe if you thought you could
get away with it, you would.

17:12.248 --> 17:13.902
When I was working
at Grant Aerospace

17:13.989 --> 17:16.774
Jessie was getting the best
treatment for her sickness.

17:16.861 --> 17:18.907
'If I hadn't made
a nuisance of myself'

17:18.994 --> 17:22.693
I'd still have my job
and my health insurance.

17:22.780 --> 17:24.043
Jessie'd be okay.

17:25.435 --> 17:28.786
So why did I bitch
and moan, right?

17:28.873 --> 17:32.660
I mean, why couldn't I
just be quiet, keep my job?

17:36.446 --> 17:38.361
I don't know.

17:38.448 --> 17:41.364
Ego and pride

17:41.451 --> 17:42.539
and vanity, I expect.

17:44.802 --> 17:46.674
Yeah, I guess
something like that.

17:51.070 --> 17:54.899
But if I thought
I could get away with it..

17:54.986 --> 17:58.251
...yes, I would kill every
last one of those bastards.

18:00.557 --> 18:02.690
But you can't kill rich people
and get away with it.

18:05.475 --> 18:08.043
Everybody knows that.

18:08.130 --> 18:10.611
- I know, I can read your mind.
- Oh, you can, really?

18:10.698 --> 18:12.700
You're thinking that
Mr. Skelling is innocent

18:12.787 --> 18:14.528
and we should release him.
Cho!

18:14.615 --> 18:16.312
That's amazing. That's exactly
what I was thinking.

18:16.399 --> 18:17.444
How do you do that?

18:17.531 --> 18:19.185
Let me try.

18:19.272 --> 18:22.057
You're thinking,
Jane is right.

18:22.144 --> 18:24.277
The man is innocent.
We should let him go.

18:24.364 --> 18:26.105
No, I think you just
want him to be innocent

18:26.192 --> 18:27.889
because his guilt
would be too simple.

18:27.976 --> 18:30.979
He has motive,
opportunity and no alibi.

18:31.066 --> 18:32.285
- Yeah.
- Yeah, boss?

18:32.372 --> 18:35.288
- Let Lee Skelling go.
- You sure?

18:35.375 --> 18:37.116
We have no hard
evidence against him.

18:37.203 --> 18:39.988
Okay. Will do.

18:40.075 --> 18:42.208
We should go and talk to
the Carnelian executives again.

18:42.295 --> 18:44.297
- Throw a cat among the pigeons.
- You think? Why?

18:44.384 --> 18:46.603
Well, what if this is not about
what it looks like it's about?

18:46.690 --> 18:47.909
What if it's about
something else entirely?

18:47.996 --> 18:49.911
- Like?
- I don't know.

18:49.998 --> 18:52.479
So you're suggesting we throw
a blind cat among the pigeons.

18:52.566 --> 18:55.656
- Yeah.
- No.

18:58.180 --> 19:01.096
[instrumental music]

19:19.070 --> 19:20.681
Howdy.

19:20.768 --> 19:22.770
I understand that you released
a promising suspect.

19:22.857 --> 19:25.076
Ah, we didn't
like him for it.

19:25.164 --> 19:28.602
We think, well, that is, I think
Agent Lisbon disagrees with me.

19:28.689 --> 19:31.909
I think the answer lies
with one of you here.

19:31.996 --> 19:34.782
- But that's absurd.
- Why?

19:34.869 --> 19:38.133
You think one of us sabotaged
David's parachute?

19:38.220 --> 19:39.352
Why not?

19:39.439 --> 19:40.831
Chutes were
clearly numbered.

19:40.918 --> 19:42.703
The saboteur would
simply have to make sure

19:42.790 --> 19:44.444
'not to choose the dud.'

19:44.531 --> 19:46.576
But how could they know
who would pick the dud?

19:46.663 --> 19:49.579
'They'd be killing a randomly
selected colleague.'

19:49.666 --> 19:51.233
Why would anyone
wanna do that?

19:51.320 --> 19:53.931
Yes, I don't know.
We'll find out.

19:54.018 --> 19:55.759
So tell us a little
about yourselves.

19:55.846 --> 19:58.109
Let's use this sadness to get
some real truths, shall we?

19:58.197 --> 20:00.895
Joyce, you first.

20:00.982 --> 20:03.767
Me first to do
what exactly?

20:03.854 --> 20:06.030
I'll tell you what I think,
just to get the ball rolling.

20:06.117 --> 20:08.163
I think you've made
your way in the world

20:08.250 --> 20:09.860
by concealing your
true feelings

20:09.947 --> 20:13.821
under a mask of
positivity and niceness

20:13.908 --> 20:15.823
but underneath you're
a seething mass of ugly

20:15.910 --> 20:17.085
bitter resentment.

20:17.172 --> 20:18.869
[chuckling]

20:18.956 --> 20:21.220
You think Faulk is
a stupid buffoon

20:21.307 --> 20:24.440
but you're far too clever to
be brave enough to tell him so.

20:24.527 --> 20:26.181
How dare you?

20:26.268 --> 20:29.358
And, you, Mr. Braemar,
Marine Corps, yes?

20:29.445 --> 20:30.925
- Yes.
- Yeah.

20:31.012 --> 20:33.710
Office politics must seem
kinda trivial in comparison.

20:35.886 --> 20:38.498
How often do you fantasize about
pulling a couple of weapons

20:38.585 --> 20:40.804
and showing these civilians
a little reality?

20:40.891 --> 20:43.372
That is baseless and
inappropriate and I resent it.

20:43.459 --> 20:46.636
Agent Lisbon, this is
a high-profile case

20:46.723 --> 20:50.379
a career-making case,
if concluded successfully.

20:50.466 --> 20:53.252
Is this how you wish to
proceed...with clownish games?

20:53.339 --> 20:56.124
I apologize.
Mr. Jane is a consultant.

20:56.211 --> 20:59.562
His statements in no way reflect
the official view of the CBI.

20:59.649 --> 21:01.869
I'm simply trying
to get a full picture

21:01.956 --> 21:03.349
of the group dynamic here,
for instance

21:03.436 --> 21:05.307
does anyone resent
the sexual relationship

21:05.394 --> 21:07.178
between Faulk and
Miss Sobell here?

21:08.745 --> 21:10.007
Anyone?

21:15.012 --> 21:19.060
- Why would anyone resent it?
- Don't engage with him, Nadia.

21:19.147 --> 21:20.888
Oh, you let him
tell you what to do.

21:20.975 --> 21:21.976
That's enough.

21:24.631 --> 21:26.589
- You can go now.
- Yes, we can.

21:29.592 --> 21:31.551
[instrumental music]

21:32.813 --> 21:34.510
You threw a cat, alright?

21:34.597 --> 21:37.731
What valuable insight
did you glean as a result?

21:37.818 --> 21:39.341
Nothing.

21:39.428 --> 21:41.604
It's a little disappointing.

21:41.691 --> 21:44.346
Well, maybe, just
maybe this case is exactly

21:44.433 --> 21:46.043
what it looks like
it's about.

21:46.130 --> 21:48.568
Bitter unsubs with a grudge
against the fat cats.

21:48.655 --> 21:50.961
Nice drive, though.

21:51.048 --> 21:53.877
Nice three hour drive.

21:53.964 --> 21:56.315
I'm hungry.
You hungry?

22:05.019 --> 22:06.499
- Ready?
- Ready.

22:09.719 --> 22:11.112
[Lisbon]
'You know what's weird
about those guys?'

22:11.199 --> 22:12.722
None of them seem
to give a damn.

22:12.809 --> 22:15.203
A colleague of theirs
falls out of the sky

22:15.290 --> 22:16.639
and they seem okay with it.

22:16.726 --> 22:18.162
Is that guilt
or indifference?

22:18.249 --> 22:20.948
Corporate brainwashing
turns them into robots.

22:21.035 --> 22:24.473
Grief isn't productive
and that's all.

22:24.560 --> 22:26.432
I don't buy that.
People make up their own minds.

22:26.519 --> 22:28.347
- You can't brainwash them.
- Oh, sure you can.

22:28.434 --> 22:30.827
That's what these corporate
retreats are all about.

22:30.914 --> 22:33.830
It's primitive brainwashing
via group suffering.

22:33.917 --> 22:37.486
It's like office karaoke
or, uh, fraternity hazing.

22:37.573 --> 22:39.009
How so?

22:39.096 --> 22:41.316
Oh, when the individual
is humiliated

22:41.403 --> 22:43.405
their perceived value
of the group is raised.

22:45.451 --> 22:48.105
I went on a retreat when I got
promoted to head of the unit.

22:48.192 --> 22:50.369
I mean, I wasn't humiliated.
I wasn't brainwashed.

22:50.456 --> 22:52.458
- So you say.
- I wasn't.

22:52.545 --> 22:54.198
It was useful, actually.

22:54.285 --> 22:55.722
How so?

22:55.809 --> 22:58.899
Learning about communication
and leadership skills

22:58.986 --> 23:01.467
building trust,
something you could profit from.

23:03.643 --> 23:04.992
What does that mean?

23:05.079 --> 23:08.343
Like you don't know
you have major trust issues.

23:08.430 --> 23:09.953
I trust people.

23:10.040 --> 23:11.477
I trust you.

23:11.564 --> 23:13.087
No, you don't.
I don't trust you either.

23:19.398 --> 23:21.617
It's upsetting to hear that.

23:21.704 --> 23:23.358
And really,
you don't trust me?

23:23.445 --> 23:24.490
Of course, not.

23:24.577 --> 23:26.187
How many times have
you lied to me

23:26.274 --> 23:27.928
misled me, tricked me?

23:28.015 --> 23:29.277
Is that trust?
No.

23:29.364 --> 23:30.757
Well, we have to
remedy this.

23:30.844 --> 23:31.801
Let's do a trust fall.

23:32.889 --> 23:34.325
- A trust fall?
- Yeah.

23:34.413 --> 23:36.415
I'm sure you did one
on your CBI retreat.

23:36.502 --> 23:38.765
It's when you turn around and
fall backward and I catch you.

23:38.852 --> 23:40.723
- Oh, yes, we did do that.
- Mm-hmm.

23:40.810 --> 23:42.290
- No.
- You won't?

23:42.377 --> 23:44.248
- We have a long drive still.
- Ah.

23:44.335 --> 23:46.120
Here we have two
co-workers recognizing

23:46.207 --> 23:48.035
the boundaries of their
professional relationship.

23:48.122 --> 23:49.950
See, you wanna trust me

23:50.037 --> 23:51.342
but there's something
holding you back.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.432
Yes, you're untrustworthy.

23:53.519 --> 23:55.085
It's my job
not to trust you.

23:55.172 --> 23:58.132
Lisbon, I want you to
know that you can trust me.

23:58.219 --> 24:00.917
No matter what happens,
I will be there for you.

24:01.004 --> 24:03.224
I will.

24:03.311 --> 24:04.355
I need you to know that.

24:06.749 --> 24:08.403
- Now can I catch you?
- Come on.

24:08.490 --> 24:10.536
Please?

24:10.623 --> 24:11.537
Fine.

24:15.541 --> 24:16.455
Come on.

24:19.545 --> 24:21.329
See, you can trust me.

24:21.416 --> 24:22.678
Oh, wow, that worked.

24:22.765 --> 24:25.202
- Suddenly, I trust you.
- Uh-huh.

24:25.289 --> 24:27.640
I allow you to drive me
around the country

24:27.727 --> 24:29.772
in this contraption.
That's serious trust.

24:42.132 --> 24:44.265
- Talk to me.
- Mm.

24:44.352 --> 24:46.615
- Do I have to?
- No.

24:46.702 --> 24:50.489
I can just fall asleep and we
can drift into oncoming traffic.

'Your call.'

25:03.284 --> 25:04.241
No.

Interesting.

25:20.780 --> 25:22.564
[cell phone ringing]

25:22.651 --> 25:26.046

message from Joe Q. Public.

they'd best say their goodbyes."

"When all go to bed,
they'd best say their goodbyes."

- 'Okay.'
- Okay, bye.

What are you doing here?

26:49.608 --> 26:51.522
Bare with us, Mr. Faulk,
we have reason to believe--

26:51.610 --> 26:52.698
Yeah, there it is.

26:54.090 --> 26:56.005
- Told you so.
- There's what?

26:56.092 --> 26:57.311
There's no need to gloat.

26:57.398 --> 26:59.139
Mr. Faulk, there is
an explosive device

26:59.226 --> 27:00.444

27:00.531 --> 27:01.924
- Oh, my God!
- Wait.

- Let me take a look.

No, I don't think
there's a pressure trigger.

- You don't think?

- Absolutely.

packed together.

28:24.050 --> 28:25.268

about the bomb

28:25.355 --> 28:27.706
he knew you people
would be on him.

28:27.793 --> 28:30.230
So he grabbed his gear
and he lit out of here.

28:30.317 --> 28:31.492
How did he know
about the bomb?

28:32.319 --> 28:33.755
I told him.

28:33.842 --> 28:36.192
I listen to
the police scanner.

28:36.279 --> 28:37.803
Kind of a hobby.

28:37.890 --> 28:40.544
- You hear some things, my God.
- Where did he go?

28:40.631 --> 28:43.025
- His truck's still here.
- Friend gave him a ride.

28:43.112 --> 28:45.462
- Friend's name?
- Sure, like I'm gonna tell you.

28:45.549 --> 28:47.900
Lee is only making
things worse by running.

28:47.987 --> 28:51.425
Right, he said to tell you

28:51.512 --> 28:54.515
that he's 100 percent innocent.
He didn't do it.

28:54.602 --> 28:56.865
But that's no matter once
the law gets a hold of you.

28:56.952 --> 28:58.432
Do you know
where he's gone to?

- Wouldn't you like to know?
- Oh, I know.

29:00.347 --> 29:02.479
- I'm just wondering if you do.
- Yeah? Where'd he go?

Well, you're welcome to look
for him. You won't find him.

I bet you're right.

- Capable man, your husband.
- Yes, he is.

29:11.662 --> 29:13.360
Is he armed?

29:13.447 --> 29:16.580
If he is, it's for huntin'
and nothing else.

29:16.667 --> 29:19.758
Send him my best wishes
next time you speak to him.

29:19.845 --> 29:20.802

29:28.157 --> 29:29.768
Damn it! I should've
never let him go.

29:29.855 --> 29:31.247
He didn't do it.

29:31.334 --> 29:34.033

but it sure looks like he did.

on Lee Skelling.

Carnelian needs to turn this
to their P.R. advantage

made money off the drop.

- Yeah.

[gunshots]
Aah! Aah!

32:12.365 --> 32:14.845
Nadia?

32:14.933 --> 32:16.064
Hey!

32:17.892 --> 32:18.980
Nadia?

32:20.416 --> 32:21.678
'Oh, my God!'

32:27.946 --> 32:30.644
[instrumental music]

32:50.272 --> 32:51.534
What do we have?

32:51.621 --> 32:53.319
The body went to
the lab a couple hours ago.

32:53.406 --> 32:55.060
Local PD's working a grid
search of the crime scene.

32:55.147 --> 32:56.800
Any word on Skelling?

32:56.887 --> 32:58.324
Nothing recent,
but the last good sighting

32:58.411 --> 33:00.326
we had of him was mid
morning at a trailhead

33:00.413 --> 33:02.632
'three and a half miles from the
ridge where Sobell was shot.'

33:02.719 --> 33:04.417
Timeline says
he could've made it easy.

33:04.504 --> 33:06.201
Coincidence.
He didn't do it.

33:06.288 --> 33:09.204
We don't..
Never mind.

33:09.291 --> 33:10.858
Whoever did this
thinks we're idiots.

33:10.945 --> 33:13.382
- Yes. A mistake.
- 'How so?'

33:13.469 --> 33:15.906
We certainly look like idiots
when our number one suspect

33:15.994 --> 33:17.517
gets shot practically
right in front of us.

33:17.604 --> 33:20.389
- Not in front of us.
- Any messages from Joe Public?

33:20.476 --> 33:23.175
- Not a word.
- Won't hear from him.

33:23.262 --> 33:25.177
That disguise has
grown boring, I suspect.

33:25.264 --> 33:27.222
What, you think
Joe Public's a ruse?

33:27.309 --> 33:29.007
So what's the motive for killing
Whittaker and Sobell then?

33:29.094 --> 33:30.747
Yes, well,
that's the question.

33:30.834 --> 33:32.358
Whittaker's death was random.

33:32.445 --> 33:34.186
Any one of them could
have taken the dud chute.

33:34.273 --> 33:36.536
But Sobell's wasn't.
What does that tell us?

33:39.321 --> 33:41.106
What?
We give up.

33:41.193 --> 33:42.629
Well, I'm not entirely sure.

33:45.023 --> 33:46.372
Are Faulk and the others
still inside?

33:46.459 --> 33:47.590
Yeah.

33:52.030 --> 33:53.422
What's in the bag?

33:53.509 --> 33:55.468
Oh. Picnic lunch.

33:55.555 --> 33:57.383
- What's in the bag?
- A bomb.

33:57.470 --> 34:00.168
Ha-ha. What's in the bag?
Seriously.

34:00.255 --> 34:02.388
Seriously, a bomb.

34:02.475 --> 34:04.172
'What happened?'

34:04.259 --> 34:06.566
Sobell and I were competing
against De Shaun and Joyce.

34:06.653 --> 34:08.698
'I was tracking Joyce
when I heard the shot.'

34:08.785 --> 34:11.701
And then I heard De Shaun
yelling from over the ridge.

34:15.183 --> 34:16.619
Mr. Faulk?

34:16.706 --> 34:18.491
Your cars are here
and the baggage is loaded.

34:18.578 --> 34:20.623
- Thank you, Jake.
- You're leaving?

34:20.710 --> 34:22.016
Yes.

34:22.103 --> 34:23.844
It was a mistake to stay.

34:23.931 --> 34:25.280
I was tempting fate
to prove a point

34:25.367 --> 34:27.456
and now poor Nadia
has paid for it.

34:27.543 --> 34:30.285
- It's too much.
- You can't blame yourself.

34:30.372 --> 34:32.157
Why not?

34:32.244 --> 34:35.421
- Excuse me?
- No, that's alright.

34:35.508 --> 34:37.379
The barb is well-placed.

34:37.466 --> 34:39.860
I've been wrong.
The company's been wrong.

34:39.947 --> 34:42.515
I need to issue a statement,
make an apology.

34:42.602 --> 34:44.995
No, no, you can't
let this psycho win.

34:45.083 --> 34:46.301
No, no, no,
not to Joe Public

34:46.388 --> 34:47.955
to the general public,
to the people.

34:48.042 --> 34:49.565
Carnelian is going to
change its ways

34:49.652 --> 34:51.089
and become a better company

34:51.176 --> 34:54.092
redeemed by its suffering,
reborn, rebranded

34:54.179 --> 34:56.268
ethical, honest, clean.

34:56.355 --> 34:59.271
- That's brilliant.
- Yes, it is.

34:59.358 --> 35:02.970
- It's brilliant.
- No, it's just necessary.

35:03.057 --> 35:04.972
However, I want a campaign on
those themes ready by next week.

35:05.059 --> 35:06.104
I'll get someone
working on..

35:06.191 --> 35:07.888
I got a phone call
from Van Pelt.

35:07.975 --> 35:09.150
Forensics got
a hit on the bullet

35:09.237 --> 35:10.325
that was taken
out of Sobell.

35:10.412 --> 35:13.372
It's a boat-tail.
264 caliber bullet

35:13.459 --> 35:15.852
'manufactured by
Winchester in 1989'

35:15.939 --> 35:18.768
as part of a custom batch to be
given to the top ten finalists

35:18.855 --> 35:20.901
in the Annual American
Cowboy Shootist competition

35:20.988 --> 35:22.250
in Reno, Nevada.

35:22.337 --> 35:25.775
- You're kidding.
- Let me guess.

35:25.862 --> 35:27.516
- Jake Cooby.
- Seventh place.

35:27.603 --> 35:29.953
Jake Cooby,
the ranch manager?

35:30.040 --> 35:32.260
Of course.
It all adds up.

35:32.347 --> 35:34.044
- It's perfect.
- It is?

35:34.132 --> 35:36.569
Why would Cooby want
to kill somebody?

35:36.656 --> 35:38.440
Well, let's go ask him.

35:38.527 --> 35:39.920
Mr. Faulk?

35:40.007 --> 35:42.357
Where does Mr. Cooby
put his feet up?

35:42.444 --> 35:44.316
- The staff kitchen.
- Ah, thank you.

35:44.403 --> 35:46.622
Uh, wait.

35:46.709 --> 35:48.233
Why is Jake involved?

35:48.320 --> 35:51.671
Uh, the bullet that killed
Nadia, apparently very special

35:51.758 --> 35:53.673
almost certainly
belongs to Mr. Cooby.

35:53.760 --> 35:57.111
- Jake? Can't be.
- You know him well, don't you?

35:57.198 --> 35:58.678
Yeah, I've been coming
here for six years.

35:58.765 --> 36:00.680
We're good friends.
This is a good man.

36:00.767 --> 36:03.726
Salt of the Earth.
This can't be.

36:03.813 --> 36:06.338
Forensics doesn't lie.

36:06.425 --> 36:07.861
He never expressed
animosity towards you?

36:07.948 --> 36:10.777
No, never.

36:10.864 --> 36:13.693
Must be a secret grudge.

36:13.780 --> 36:16.043
Staff kitchen,
you said, this way?

36:19.351 --> 36:21.309
- Maybe you can help us.
- Of course. Anything--

36:21.396 --> 36:22.745
Come with me when
I talk to Mr. Cooby.

36:22.832 --> 36:24.138
- Well, alright.
- Okay.

36:24.225 --> 36:27.097
Hold on. I don't think
that's such a good idea.

36:27.185 --> 36:28.664
Well, it's him
that Cooby's angry with.

36:28.751 --> 36:30.710
Let's use that, vex him,
open him up a little.

36:30.797 --> 36:32.233
Maybe it'll work,
but it's too risky.

36:32.320 --> 36:34.192
You can wait outside
with your gun drawn

36:34.279 --> 36:36.368
in case Cooby gets
a little haywire.

36:36.455 --> 36:39.327
[instrumental music]

36:43.462 --> 36:44.941
You saying it's me?

36:45.028 --> 36:46.378
I shot her?

36:46.465 --> 36:48.597
Yes, and cut
Whittaker's parachute

36:48.684 --> 36:50.643
and planted the bomb that
almost killed Mr. Faulk here.

36:50.730 --> 36:53.036
I surely did not.

36:53.123 --> 36:55.474
Jeez! Why in heck
would I do all that?

36:55.561 --> 36:57.954
- That's what we'd like to know.
- Are you guys for real?

36:58.041 --> 36:59.478
Come on!

36:59.565 --> 37:01.088
How long have you
known me, Mr. Faulk?

37:01.175 --> 37:02.959
Why, Jake?

37:03.046 --> 37:05.310
What did I ever do
to you to justify this?

37:05.397 --> 37:08.400
- Help me understand.
- Okay.

37:08.487 --> 37:11.620
Now see here,
I don't know how

37:11.707 --> 37:13.013
but you got the wrong
idea about me.

37:13.100 --> 37:15.320
Is that right?

37:15.407 --> 37:17.147
Then why was it that
one of your prize bullets

37:17.235 --> 37:18.192
killed Nadia Sobell?

37:18.279 --> 37:19.802
It was?

37:19.889 --> 37:22.327
And why did you build
this clever thing, huh?

37:22.414 --> 37:25.417
What?
Is that a bomb?

37:25.504 --> 37:27.636
Yes, Jake, it's your bomb.
You made it.

37:27.723 --> 37:29.943
No, I didn't!
What have you been smokin', man?

37:30.030 --> 37:31.553
Really?
No, it's not?

37:31.640 --> 37:33.860
This is not your trigger?

37:33.947 --> 37:35.209
Uh, for God's sakes!

37:35.296 --> 37:36.776
- Is that..
- It's okay.

37:36.863 --> 37:40.693
Everyone just stay calm.
It's no problem.

37:40.780 --> 37:43.261
I'm pretty sure,
you disarm it by removing

37:43.348 --> 37:44.305
this wire from
the red terminal.

37:44.392 --> 37:45.480
No!

37:45.567 --> 37:46.481
Idiot.

37:49.179 --> 37:50.920
There. What the hell
are you playin' at?

37:51.007 --> 37:53.836
Aha...as they say.

37:53.923 --> 37:56.361
What are you talkin' about?

37:56.448 --> 37:58.928
You knew how to
disarm the bomb..

37:59.015 --> 38:00.365
'...because you made it.'

38:00.452 --> 38:04.543
You planted it to divert
suspicion from yourself.

38:04.630 --> 38:07.981
Ergo, it was you that
killed Whittaker and Sobell.

38:10.113 --> 38:11.637
I hate to spoil your theory

38:11.724 --> 38:13.203
but it's obvious
how to disarm the bomb.

38:13.291 --> 38:14.944
No, it wasn't.

38:15.031 --> 38:16.555
I bet 90 percent of people
would think to remove

38:16.642 --> 38:17.773
this wire here, that'd be
the right thing to do.

38:17.860 --> 38:19.035
No!

38:19.122 --> 38:21.168
The bomb squad
took out the explosive.

38:21.255 --> 38:23.431
That's just Play-Doh
and you are a wretched

38:23.518 --> 38:24.867
scheming, cold-hearted murderer.

38:24.954 --> 38:26.826
Where do you keep
your tea, Mr. Cooby?

38:26.913 --> 38:28.828
Uh, in the cabinet.

38:28.915 --> 38:31.221
- You're mad.
- Thank you.

38:31.309 --> 38:34.529
Oh, uh, and could you please
ask Agent Lisbon to come in?

38:35.487 --> 38:36.879
Thanks, Mr. Cooby.

38:41.275 --> 38:42.885
You have no legal
proof whatsoever.

38:42.972 --> 38:44.887
Eh.

38:44.974 --> 38:47.586
Legal proof will be found,
no doubt.

38:47.673 --> 38:49.805
But personally,
I don't need it.

38:49.892 --> 38:53.200
I just like to know
that I'm right.

38:53.287 --> 38:56.464
Sir, put your hands
behind your back.

38:56.551 --> 38:58.814
'You're under arrest.'

38:58.901 --> 39:01.556
Let's go.

39:01.643 --> 39:04.516
[instrumental music]

39:12.088 --> 39:14.352
[goat bleating]

39:16.876 --> 39:18.225
I knew it was you as soon
as the bomb under your bed

39:18.312 --> 39:19.618
failed to go off.

39:19.705 --> 39:22.272
It was too clever, Randy.
Too clever.

39:22.360 --> 39:23.709
Don't call me Randy.

39:23.796 --> 39:25.537
But why would you
randomly want to kill

39:25.624 --> 39:27.539
one of your own executives?

39:27.626 --> 39:29.236
Doesn't make sense.

39:29.323 --> 39:31.020
Then Sobell was shot

39:31.107 --> 39:33.371
and I saw your whole game.

39:34.154 --> 39:35.764
Randy.

39:35.851 --> 39:37.070
That's very childish.

39:37.157 --> 39:39.289
Whittaker's death
was merely a camouflage

39:39.377 --> 39:42.031
to disguise Sobell's death.

39:42.118 --> 39:43.206
She's who you needed dead.

39:44.730 --> 39:47.254
I won't say anything
until my lawyer arrives.

39:47.341 --> 39:50.388
Suffice to say,
you have no proof.

39:50.475 --> 39:53.869
The question is,
what did Sobell have on you?

39:53.956 --> 39:56.350
- What was she going to do?
- Nothing.

39:58.134 --> 40:00.006
That was a
rhetorical question.

40:00.093 --> 40:02.269
We know everything
we need to now.

40:02.356 --> 40:06.360
This is an affidavit
from Nadia Sobell's lawyer.

40:06.447 --> 40:07.666
Nadia was secretly
negotiating to join KBT.

40:07.753 --> 40:09.363
your number one rival.

40:09.450 --> 40:11.670
'She was also drafting a sexual
harassment suit against you'

40:11.757 --> 40:13.106
to coincide with
her departure.

40:13.193 --> 40:14.455
That's why she was
shorting Carnelian Stock

40:14.542 --> 40:16.109
and that's why
you needed to kill her.

40:16.196 --> 40:19.634
Because nobody gets on top
of Randall Faulk, do they?

40:21.070 --> 40:22.202
Nobody.

40:24.378 --> 40:25.858
Where's my lawyer?

40:25.945 --> 40:27.076
But I gotta tell you

40:27.163 --> 40:30.166
the whole Joe Q. Public
ruse, genius.

40:32.125 --> 40:34.040
I couldn't see
how you could profit

40:34.127 --> 40:35.433
from attacking
your own company.

40:35.520 --> 40:37.435
But you, you have vision.

40:37.522 --> 40:41.134
"Carnelian reborn
and rebranded."

40:41.221 --> 40:42.788
Everybody loves a comeback.

40:42.875 --> 40:44.442
Everybody loves redemption.

40:46.356 --> 40:47.662
You have nothing.

40:47.749 --> 40:49.185
We have enough to
rip you to pieces.

40:49.272 --> 40:50.796
And you know it.

40:50.883 --> 40:51.884
'So before your
lawyer gets here'

40:51.971 --> 40:55.104
and ties everybody's hands

40:55.191 --> 40:56.236
let's make a deal.

41:03.069 --> 41:05.637
- I'm listening.
- Good.

41:05.724 --> 41:08.291
We'll call Whittaker
manslaughter one.

41:08.378 --> 41:10.032
We'll forget
about the bomb.

41:11.860 --> 41:13.601
And we won't go after
the death penalty.

41:19.172 --> 41:20.913
In exchange for what?

41:22.088 --> 41:24.960
