WEBVTT

00:05.255 --> 00:06.837
It's a locomotive engine
in there.

00:06.924 --> 00:08.460
Imagine the sound of that.

00:08.550 --> 00:10.007
Will it let us sleep,
do you think?

00:10.093 --> 00:12.335
Don't you worry.
We're gonna be so knackered,

00:12.429 --> 00:14.295
it would take this sinking
to wake us.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.382
Next in line.

00:17.476 --> 00:20.219
Good morning to you.
Have you your orders for me?

00:21.813 --> 00:24.055
Any tips, sir, for a first-timer?

00:25.776 --> 00:27.438
The advice
I'm about to give you holds

00:27.528 --> 00:30.111
whether it's your virgin voyage
or your twentieth.

00:30.864 --> 00:33.072
Then I'm keen to hear it, sir.

00:33.158 --> 00:35.866
When the ships set sail,
be sure you're aboard.

00:35.953 --> 00:36.989
- Here you are.
- Sir.

00:37.079 --> 00:40.163
See you in a month's time
for first muster, Mr. Hickey.

00:40.249 --> 00:42.662
Next up, step forward.

00:48.173 --> 00:50.881
Some of what these men have packed is...

00:50.968 --> 00:53.051
impractical at best, Francis.

00:55.681 --> 00:57.843
If we're to make it inland
before winter,

00:57.933 --> 00:59.925
this cannot hold.

01:00.018 --> 01:01.975
It's a long march, James.

01:03.313 --> 01:05.474
There will be time
to reconsider.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.683
Things will drop away.

01:08.986 --> 01:12.570
But to ask these men to see
these bits of who they are

01:12.656 --> 01:14.238
as one more threat to them...

01:16.702 --> 01:18.318
No.

01:18.412 --> 01:19.994
Let them get
some miles behind them

01:20.080 --> 01:21.742
before we ask them to do that.

01:22.457 --> 01:24.039
But these first miles

01:24.126 --> 01:25.833
are some of the hardest miles,

01:25.919 --> 01:29.708
and we don't know yet if the
advance party made it to shore.

01:29.798 --> 01:30.959
Exactly.

01:34.261 --> 01:36.548
The first land camp
must be up by now.

01:36.638 --> 01:38.470
Maybe they'll have
Tuesday dinner...

01:38.557 --> 01:41.516
We don't even know if they made it
back to shore, Manson.

01:44.730 --> 01:47.768
We would have heard word
by now if there was an attack.

01:48.525 --> 01:51.768
Somebody would have come back.
There's almost 50 of them.

01:51.862 --> 01:53.694
It could be attacking now.

01:53.780 --> 01:55.316
If it comes, it comes.

01:56.199 --> 01:59.112
All you can do is make sure
you're not the one in its jaws.

01:59.202 --> 02:00.534
Thank you, Mr. Hickey.

02:01.288 --> 02:03.575
I hope I'm stood next to you
when it comes.

02:03.665 --> 02:05.873
You've just given me permission
for a good shove.

02:07.586 --> 02:10.124
It's been waiting for us to do
exactly what we're doing.

02:11.340 --> 02:12.797
There's no defenses out there.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.959
Fear is a choice, Billy.

02:16.053 --> 02:17.965
Ignorance is a choice.

02:19.806 --> 02:21.547
As is believing
Lieutenant Fairholme

02:21.642 --> 02:23.349
is on his way back with help.

02:26.271 --> 02:28.854
Or that these natives
are our friends.

02:39.159 --> 02:41.947
- Gently with that one, please.
- It's alright.

02:44.581 --> 02:46.789
Has Mr. Bridgens
seen you today?

02:46.875 --> 02:48.457
Aye.

02:48.543 --> 02:50.284
The mandragora
is no longer helping?

02:52.047 --> 02:53.163
I'm sorry for that.

02:54.049 --> 02:56.257
Mr. Bridgens
will increase the dose

02:56.343 --> 02:59.507
the rest of what we safely can,
or try another remedy...

02:59.596 --> 03:01.588
coca wine or a stronger tonic.

03:02.307 --> 03:05.391
These might put you in a bit of a haze,
but it could be worth it.

03:06.895 --> 03:09.933
Are these our own choices,
Cornelius,

03:10.023 --> 03:12.015
or are they being made for us?

03:13.777 --> 03:15.769
What are you asking, Billy?

03:15.862 --> 03:19.026
They also told us lemon juice
would ward off the scurvy.

03:20.492 --> 03:22.529
I heard, when it gets bad,
your gums pull back.

03:22.619 --> 03:24.110
Scars dissolve
and open back up.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.615
No, no, no, no, no.

03:27.666 --> 03:29.407
Say what's on your mind.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.122
You're among friends.

03:33.255 --> 03:35.121
Am I?

03:38.260 --> 03:41.253
We could make a go of it
for ourselves, couldn't we?

03:43.056 --> 03:45.343
A smaller group.

03:45.434 --> 03:48.552
Because 40 men are going
to be too slow on that ice,

03:48.645 --> 03:50.807
let me tell you.

03:50.897 --> 03:53.640
Well, the ice will be
slow-going regardless.

03:54.568 --> 03:55.604
But once we make land...

03:55.694 --> 03:57.981
Then it would be better to wait...

03:58.071 --> 03:59.278
until the larger group

03:59.364 --> 04:01.606
hauls all the supplies
to solid ground.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.492
It would, yes.

04:06.663 --> 04:08.370
That gives us time, then,

04:08.457 --> 04:10.073
to think things through.

04:12.627 --> 04:15.711
I suspect there are others
who'd be friendly to this.

04:15.797 --> 04:17.880
It would be good
to find a few more.

04:19.593 --> 04:22.005
Sort the ranks out
of this in advance.

04:24.514 --> 04:27.473
We're leaving enough food
to see you through winter.

04:28.310 --> 04:30.677
Enough coal
to last that long as well.

04:32.022 --> 04:34.685
It will be enough
if all of you berth back here.

04:36.985 --> 04:39.477
A thaw may yet surprise us.

04:39.571 --> 04:43.941
If it does, sail south past
King William and hug the shore.

04:44.701 --> 04:46.909
That is what we
will be doing as well.

04:47.954 --> 04:50.992
If you make it back onto
the charts at Cape Herschel,

04:51.082 --> 04:53.916
sail east into the strait here

04:54.002 --> 04:56.119
that cuts King William off
from the mainland.

04:56.213 --> 04:59.331
It's either landblocked or,
as I believe, open.

04:59.424 --> 05:01.211
Either way, go no further.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.463
The mouth to
Back's Fish River is just here.

05:04.387 --> 05:06.049
We will signal
from the mainland side

05:06.139 --> 05:09.758
if we have yet to cross then
from the King William side.

05:11.436 --> 05:16.431
But if you do not see any sign
of us by September 1st,

05:16.525 --> 05:18.437
it means
we are already inland...

05:19.402 --> 05:21.485
and you should
turn around and sail hard...

05:22.614 --> 05:24.856
out and away.

05:24.950 --> 05:26.987
Any version of this,
you realize,

05:27.077 --> 05:30.195
makes you men the first
to complete the Passage.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.415
I hope it happens. I do.

05:35.877 --> 05:38.085
The sacrifice
that you men are making...

05:39.464 --> 05:41.706
deserves a great reward.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.792
You needn't
worry yourself, sir.

05:43.885 --> 05:46.844
If we're to perish,
we'd prefer to do it here,

05:46.930 --> 05:49.843
under English blankets
and smelling English coal.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.850
Not out there in that void.

05:53.603 --> 05:55.185
That's reward enough.

05:59.317 --> 06:01.559
Bid your farewells
to the others, then.

06:12.289 --> 06:15.373
Find your assigned sledge
and settle your personals.

06:16.126 --> 06:18.118
This next bit
a captain does alone.

06:21.673 --> 06:23.289
So I've heard.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.839
The men are behind you, sir.

06:34.311 --> 06:36.223
Very much behind you.

07:01.713 --> 07:04.956
Friend, mother, lover...

07:05.050 --> 07:07.463
all the things they say
a ship is to a captain...

07:07.552 --> 07:09.544
and they miss
the only thing that matters.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.514
Confessor.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.518
This ship knows everything
about me, Thomas.

07:18.772 --> 07:21.480
In '37 when George Back
wrecked it,

07:21.566 --> 07:23.398
tugged it home
across the Atlantic...

07:25.362 --> 07:26.648
she was barely afloat.

07:26.738 --> 07:28.946
No-one could believe
she'd kept herself up.

07:32.077 --> 07:34.285
She may well triumph.

08:31.428 --> 08:33.544
Give the word,
Lieutenant Irving.

08:35.347 --> 08:38.341
Forward, men!

09:23.980 --> 09:25.812
What do you report,
Mr. Hartnell?

09:25.899 --> 09:27.390
Just more spinning, sir.

09:27.484 --> 09:30.397
But we are definitely
on Lieutenant Little's tracks.

09:30.487 --> 09:32.649
I mean, they're windblown
and the ridges have shifted,

09:32.739 --> 09:35.026
but they're
definitely still intact.

09:35.116 --> 09:37.028
He's got a feeling for it,
this one.

09:37.118 --> 09:40.737
Very well.
I'll continue to rely on your eyes.

09:40.830 --> 09:43.243
Help us find our way safely,
Mr. Hartnell.

09:43.333 --> 09:44.540
Yes, sir.

09:44.626 --> 09:46.709
Right, move it on.
Move the boat.

09:51.716 --> 09:53.958
Lead them off, Lieutenant.

09:55.178 --> 09:58.091
Everyone. Including you, Mr. Hickey.

10:38.680 --> 10:40.137
Mr. Collins.

10:40.223 --> 10:42.431
Is Mr. Morfin camped near you?

10:42.517 --> 10:44.224
He's in the tent just next, sir.

10:47.355 --> 10:50.348
And how are you faring, then?
Well enough?

10:55.572 --> 10:58.360
A-Actually, I don't know
how any of us could be...

10:59.367 --> 11:01.734
"well", really,
with what's happened.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.698
Here.

11:07.792 --> 11:10.079
What's the worst of it, Collins...

11:10.170 --> 11:11.752
that you would be
willing to share?

11:11.838 --> 11:14.376
It... It might help to say it out loud.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.133
I've tried, sir.

11:18.219 --> 11:20.506
Well, you haven't tried with me.

11:31.316 --> 11:33.979
It's madness. I can't sleep.

11:43.077 --> 11:45.194
I didn't want to go
to Carnivale.

11:46.247 --> 11:48.455
I compelled myself to go.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.282
I compel myself
to do everything now.

11:51.419 --> 11:54.082
I have to try to convince myself that...

11:54.172 --> 11:55.379
there won't be any, uh...

11:56.591 --> 11:57.672
problems.

11:59.552 --> 12:00.668
And then there are.

12:02.263 --> 12:04.346
There are a lot
of problems now.

12:06.184 --> 12:08.301
In the dive helmet...

12:08.394 --> 12:10.181
it smells of grease.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.689
- Did you know that?
- No.

12:16.152 --> 12:18.815
It's a problem to be
in my job and be...

12:20.782 --> 12:22.819
Be what?

12:22.909 --> 12:25.026
Afraid of the smell of grease.

12:26.329 --> 12:28.412
I can smell it everywhere.

12:28.998 --> 12:30.705
I didn't used
to think about it at all,

12:30.792 --> 12:33.535
like the sawn wood from all the coffins
Mr. Honey's built.

12:33.628 --> 12:35.494
My father used to be
a belly builder.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.124
He made the wood parts
for pianos.

12:37.215 --> 12:39.377
I used to play in the shavings.

12:41.594 --> 12:44.462
Now I have a different
sense of that smell.

12:46.474 --> 12:48.966
And now I can't stop
smelling Carnivale.

12:50.311 --> 12:51.552
The smoke, you mean?

12:54.148 --> 12:56.356
More the meat.

12:58.653 --> 13:01.737
The boys who died...
they were cooking.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.778
Like fillets grilling.

13:04.867 --> 13:06.608
Some of them were my friends.

13:06.703 --> 13:08.990
I was screaming,
"Help them! Help them!"

13:09.080 --> 13:13.120
But my mouth went dry to wet
the second I smelled them.

13:14.252 --> 13:17.165
I couldn't stop it.
And I'm sorry for it.

13:21.050 --> 13:22.461
My nose and my stomach,

13:22.552 --> 13:24.839
they don't know horrible
from supper.

13:26.097 --> 13:27.508
But I do.

13:28.599 --> 13:30.431
I do.

13:48.369 --> 13:50.076
Captain.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.244
Come.

13:52.582 --> 13:54.665
Sorry to disturb you. Uh...

13:54.751 --> 13:57.585
The matter we discussed...
the tins, sir.

13:58.504 --> 14:00.587
What about them?

14:01.382 --> 14:02.964
The hunting parties
you proposed,

14:03.051 --> 14:05.213
might they begin now, please?

14:05.303 --> 14:09.718
Out here, on the pack?
What do you propose we'd hunt?

14:09.807 --> 14:12.174
- Seal, bear.
- It takes years for a Netsilik

14:12.268 --> 14:14.180
to learn how to hunt seal.
You know that.

14:14.270 --> 14:17.980
The men cannot continue
to eat these tins, sir.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.148
They must.

14:21.235 --> 14:23.272
For now.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.820
I know it's unhelpful to hear.

14:24.906 --> 14:26.989
Profoundly unhelpful... sir.

14:28.242 --> 14:30.529
Mr. Wall is preparing
the next round as we speak.

14:30.620 --> 14:33.078
Every tin consumed,
our situation is...

14:33.164 --> 14:35.531
The moment we set foot
on King William Island,

14:35.625 --> 14:37.662
I will commence
hunting parties.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.871
Who knows?

14:41.964 --> 14:44.001
We may get lucky
with some caribou.

14:49.764 --> 14:52.097
That you and Lieutenant Gore
found none a year ago

14:52.183 --> 14:54.345
does not mean
we can't fare better now.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.805
We share a burden, you and I.

15:02.527 --> 15:04.018
Keeping this.

15:08.991 --> 15:12.735
One line. One line.

15:33.975 --> 15:35.307
How much you want to wager

15:35.393 --> 15:37.680
that dog's rations
are equal to ours?

15:40.565 --> 15:42.648
He's earning his keep, I reckon.

16:04.213 --> 16:06.170
Ah! Oh.

16:10.178 --> 16:13.592
I've got you, I've got you!
That's it! That's it!

16:13.681 --> 16:15.092
You shouldn't be on any watch

16:15.183 --> 16:17.345
you haven't got the bottom for,
Morfin!

16:28.738 --> 16:30.479
I'm sure he'd relieve you
of watch duty

16:30.573 --> 16:32.610
if Mr. Goodsir knew you were...

16:34.160 --> 16:35.947
Oh, good Christ.

16:40.374 --> 16:41.660
Our sweep this morning

16:41.751 --> 16:43.868
was further out than
yesterday's dog watches,

16:43.961 --> 16:46.169
or Morfin here
would never have seen it.

17:15.992 --> 17:18.280
Can you make out who they are?

17:18.829 --> 17:21.242
Lieutenant Fairholme's
sledge party.

17:26.462 --> 17:29.546
Who else has seen this, or knows?

17:29.632 --> 17:31.544
Just us four now, sir.

17:32.802 --> 17:34.759
On pain of a full court martial,

17:34.845 --> 17:36.711
no-one is to hear of this

17:36.806 --> 17:40.015
until such time as
Captain Fitzjames and myself

17:40.101 --> 17:41.888
decide to share it
with the men.

17:41.978 --> 17:43.685
Yes, sir.

17:56.534 --> 17:59.151
Eighteen miles.

17:59.245 --> 18:01.032
That's all they made.

18:03.332 --> 18:04.948
Our rescue.

18:18.723 --> 18:20.965
- Halt!
- Halt!

18:44.081 --> 18:46.323
We'll have to go up
in switchbacks.

18:47.835 --> 18:50.623
We should send
a first runner group

18:50.713 --> 18:53.080
to set the belays.

18:53.174 --> 18:56.463
But there's no telling what
the other side will give us.

18:56.552 --> 18:59.511
This here might be
the handsome face of it.

18:59.597 --> 19:01.259
And the hopeful one.

19:02.099 --> 19:03.681
You're right.

19:04.852 --> 19:07.720
I'll go first... with James.

19:09.398 --> 19:11.640
We'll sight what we sight

19:11.734 --> 19:13.646
and report.

19:31.462 --> 19:33.624
Even the flag's up.

19:33.714 --> 19:35.797
We needn't have worried,
Francis.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.099
If we have luck finding game...

19:50.189 --> 19:52.727
we can spend
several weeks here.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.902
It would be best to tamp down
every trace of illness

19:57.988 --> 19:59.900
before continuing.

19:59.990 --> 20:01.322
It was a hard trip,

20:01.409 --> 20:03.776
even for the halest
in our party.

20:03.869 --> 20:06.031
I never want to feel ice
under my boots again.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.788
If we make it out of this...

20:11.877 --> 20:14.494
all these men deserve
medals in gold.

20:14.588 --> 20:16.204
If we make it out of this,

20:16.298 --> 20:18.881
the men deserve
every gold thing there is.

20:20.511 --> 20:23.094
Did you sight anything at all
on your trek here?

20:25.099 --> 20:26.715
We saw no signs
of the creature,

20:26.809 --> 20:28.892
if that's your question.

20:29.478 --> 20:31.219
Sir. Lieutenant.

20:33.524 --> 20:36.733
The perimeter's drawn now,
but it's not loaded.

20:37.486 --> 20:39.273
How do you mean, Sergeant?

20:39.363 --> 20:42.606
I'd like to recommend arming
some additional men in camp.

20:43.617 --> 20:45.700
Even with our camp
tightly pitched,

20:45.786 --> 20:48.654
the size of the perimeter
still concerns me.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.205
We're only eight Marines now,

20:50.291 --> 20:54.285
and it would be a help to us
to bolster our numbers, armed.

20:54.378 --> 20:55.869
Who first comes to mind?

20:55.963 --> 20:58.080
Well, I've put
some thought into it.

20:58.174 --> 21:00.086
Armitage. He's a crack shot.

21:00.176 --> 21:01.917
As is Crispe.

21:02.845 --> 21:04.802
Manson's up to it, seems to me.

21:05.890 --> 21:07.347
Teeley, Coombs.

21:07.433 --> 21:08.844
Mr. Hickey
would be a good help.

21:08.934 --> 21:10.345
We'll hold off on that.

21:11.312 --> 21:12.473
Sir, I recommend that we...

21:12.563 --> 21:15.146
It will be a waxing moon
tonight, yes?

21:15.232 --> 21:16.689
Near to full.

21:16.776 --> 21:19.359
We'll be able to see miles
in every direction.

21:20.488 --> 21:23.071
If something comes hunting us,

21:23.157 --> 21:25.444
there will be time to ring
the alarm and arm more men,

21:25.534 --> 21:27.526
even from sleep.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.577
This site was well chosen.

21:29.663 --> 21:31.495
It's going to be difficult
to surprise us

21:31.582 --> 21:33.619
on such level ground, hm?

21:34.335 --> 21:36.076
Aye, sir.

21:36.170 --> 21:37.581
We can revisit this,

21:37.671 --> 21:39.128
but for the moment,

21:39.215 --> 21:42.629
the armory is closed past arms
for Marines and officers.

21:42.718 --> 21:44.630
Aye, sir.

21:52.353 --> 21:55.096
I do understand
why he makes that request, sir.

21:55.189 --> 21:57.021
As do I.

21:57.107 --> 21:58.598
The reason is sound.

22:00.861 --> 22:02.397
Some of those names are not.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.055
I am trying.

23:24.570 --> 23:28.780
Who's that now?

23:30.784 --> 23:32.241
Somebody, help us!

23:32.328 --> 23:35.162
That doesn't promise well.

23:38.083 --> 23:40.325
There's no attack, men.
It's Morfin.

23:41.921 --> 23:43.958
He staggered out
and just collapsed, sir.

23:44.048 --> 23:46.085
What do you need, Morfin?

23:48.636 --> 23:51.128
I need you... to shoot me.

23:51.221 --> 23:53.463
Will you do it?
Will you, please?

23:54.516 --> 23:56.007
Put me down.

24:06.362 --> 24:08.274
John.

24:14.662 --> 24:16.278
My head.

24:16.372 --> 24:18.079
Cut it off.

24:19.667 --> 24:21.249
Put it with the others.

24:27.049 --> 24:28.881
No-one is going
to put you down.

24:34.723 --> 24:36.430
Private, be careful!

24:36.517 --> 24:38.349
No-one fire!
No-one fire!

24:40.396 --> 24:42.558
Mr. Morfin is in great pain.

24:44.149 --> 24:46.516
He'd like us to end it for him.

24:47.069 --> 24:49.231
Do not.

24:50.572 --> 24:51.733
Weapons down.

24:53.492 --> 24:54.573
Down.

24:58.956 --> 25:02.370
I... I have... options, Morfin.

25:03.085 --> 25:04.872
Things to try.
We discussed this.

25:04.962 --> 25:08.626
I have, uh... wine of coca, for instance.

25:08.716 --> 25:11.333
That will certainly be
a tonic for you

25:11.427 --> 25:13.510
now we're stopped and camped.

25:16.432 --> 25:18.890
John. John.

25:18.976 --> 25:22.060
If Dr. Goodsir thinks
that wine of coca will help...

25:23.188 --> 25:24.929
it's worth trying, isn't it?

25:26.275 --> 25:28.062
You'll never get back
to Gainsborough

25:28.152 --> 25:29.734
if you don't try everything.

25:31.030 --> 25:32.771
Gainsborough, yes?

25:34.450 --> 25:36.191
Where your people are.

25:38.704 --> 25:41.663
Seaman Morfin,
lower your weapon.

25:43.459 --> 25:45.041
That's an order.

26:08.233 --> 26:09.724
You're clear, Sergeant.

26:26.460 --> 26:28.543
Carry Mr. Morfin
to the stores tent.

26:31.215 --> 26:33.207
Bury him in the morning.

26:35.344 --> 26:38.257
Lieutenant Hodgson,
will you oversee it, please?

26:48.190 --> 26:50.022
Go back to your tents, men.

26:55.489 --> 26:57.071
Try to get some sleep.

28:29.875 --> 28:31.707
The night you accompanied Mr. Hickey

28:31.793 --> 28:33.284
to subdue Lady Silence...

28:33.378 --> 28:36.997
is there more to that story
than we've heard?

28:39.092 --> 28:42.631
Were others involved,
even indirectly?

28:46.600 --> 28:48.933
You have my trust,
Mr. Hartnell,

28:49.019 --> 28:51.602
but you needn't answer
if it puts you in a corner.

28:52.314 --> 28:54.397
It's not that, sir.

28:55.442 --> 28:57.183
There was a fourth man.

28:57.819 --> 29:01.062
- Sergeant Tozer?
- No, sir.

29:04.326 --> 29:06.409
Watch Mr. Armitage.

29:10.290 --> 29:13.328
We'll watch him together
if you're willing, Mr. Hartnell.

29:13.418 --> 29:16.001
- My apologies, sir.
- It's alright, Jopson.

29:16.713 --> 29:18.625
Thank you, Mr. Hartnell.

29:19.299 --> 29:22.007
- We'll speak again.
- Yes, sir.

29:24.137 --> 29:26.220
Thank you, sir.

29:30.060 --> 29:32.552
You should have fetched me
when you woke to dress, sir.

29:32.646 --> 29:34.478
I couldn't sleep.

29:35.399 --> 29:37.231
You should have fetched me
for that, too.

29:37.317 --> 29:40.901
I have the drops Dr. MacDonald
mixed for you last summer.

29:40.988 --> 29:44.447
And how does it feel, not being
fetched for drops or drawers?

29:44.533 --> 29:45.990
Miserable, sir.

29:47.077 --> 29:49.660
That is my job
you are shaving away.

29:52.291 --> 29:55.375
You should also know that, Mr. Wall

29:55.460 --> 29:57.702
reports that Neptune
is missing again.

29:58.672 --> 30:01.710
He says he thinks he may
have left the gate unlocked.

30:03.760 --> 30:06.673
Well, he'll come back
when he's hungry.

30:06.763 --> 30:08.755
Sir.

30:08.849 --> 30:12.058
Uh... I need to hold
a command meeting this morning

30:12.144 --> 30:14.807
for Captain Fitzjames
and the lieutenants.

30:14.896 --> 30:16.637
I'll let you gather them.

30:17.566 --> 30:19.102
Oh, thank you very much, sir.

30:30.746 --> 30:33.580
W <i>e have an emergency
with our tinned provisions,</i>

30:33.665 --> 30:35.076
<i>gentlemen.</i>

30:37.586 --> 30:39.327
Not just rotting.

30:40.839 --> 30:45.004
Dr. Goodsir has discovered
a more insidious issue,

30:45.093 --> 30:47.210
which has been silently
undercutting all of us

30:47.304 --> 30:48.545
for years.

30:50.474 --> 30:52.887
<i>It's how
they were manufactured.</i>

30:52.976 --> 30:54.638
All the cans?

30:57.522 --> 30:59.263
Every single one of them?

31:06.365 --> 31:08.573
Hunting parties begin today.

31:08.658 --> 31:10.570
One south, one east.

31:11.495 --> 31:14.408
Each party will have two
officers and four mixed men.

31:15.332 --> 31:16.994
They will surely have concerns

31:17.084 --> 31:20.122
about traveling any distance
in such small numbers,

31:20.212 --> 31:22.795
but it is a risk
we urgently need to take.

31:22.881 --> 31:24.417
If we're unable
to find game, sir?

31:24.508 --> 31:27.717
Then we will proceed as we have
and keep moving south.

31:29.304 --> 31:30.966
I'll take south.

31:31.056 --> 31:33.423
Lieutenant Irving
can take east.

31:33.517 --> 31:36.385
You'll stay in camp with
Commander Fitzjames and myself.

31:36.478 --> 31:39.437
We need to start planning
the fresh-water parties.

31:41.316 --> 31:44.559
But that leaves
only three lieutenants, sir.

31:44.653 --> 31:47.066
Because it is needed,

31:47.155 --> 31:48.521
and because it is deserved,

31:48.615 --> 31:50.356
I am making a promotion
this morning.

31:51.993 --> 31:54.406
An emergency measure,
if you will...

31:55.497 --> 31:58.240
but one that is wholly sincere.

32:00.043 --> 32:02.376
To my knowledge,
this has never been done.

32:03.422 --> 32:07.132
But then... much of what we are
now doing has never been done,

32:07.217 --> 32:10.585
so... I don't want there to be
any confusion over this.

32:10.679 --> 32:14.548
Someone on this expedition
has earned our trust,

32:14.641 --> 32:17.349
respect and confidence...

32:17.436 --> 32:21.646
in a way that merits absolute
a place at this table.

32:26.111 --> 32:27.397
Well, gentlemen,

32:27.487 --> 32:30.355
we have a new lieutenant
to welcome this morning.

32:31.032 --> 32:32.614
James.

32:52.137 --> 32:55.301
Let me clarify, Jopson.
I mean a third lieutenant.

32:56.016 --> 32:57.723
There is some
modicum of protocol

32:57.809 --> 32:59.391
that must be observed,
even here.

32:59.478 --> 33:01.185
Look at your face.

33:01.980 --> 33:03.972
Well, congratulations, Jopson.

33:06.943 --> 33:08.935
- Well done.
- Thank you.

33:09.029 --> 33:11.442
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

33:11.531 --> 33:13.272
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

33:23.335 --> 33:25.042
Did you hear about...

33:27.005 --> 33:28.496
Lieutenant Jopson?

33:30.717 --> 33:32.709
It's best if we keep
our talk low.

33:34.679 --> 33:36.762
Very well.

33:36.848 --> 33:39.716
What do you think happened
to Morfin last night?

33:41.353 --> 33:43.094
What was it?

33:43.897 --> 33:47.015
He was tired of being in pain.
It made him desperate.

33:47.108 --> 33:48.849
Because he was ill.

33:50.570 --> 33:52.232
Ill how?

33:53.406 --> 33:55.193
Scurvy.

33:55.283 --> 33:59.072
I suppose. Enough men
are showing sign of it.

33:59.162 --> 34:00.994
- It's not scurvy.
- Dr. Goodsir said...

34:01.081 --> 34:04.165
Dr. Goodsir's lying to you.
To all of us.

34:06.044 --> 34:07.785
As is the Captain.

34:08.630 --> 34:10.496
And not only about this.

34:11.299 --> 34:14.792
What happened to Morfin
is happening to all of us.

34:16.221 --> 34:18.634
And Goodsir, Crozier, know it.

34:19.975 --> 34:23.217
And it's going to keep happening,
as long as we're eating from the tins.

34:23.311 --> 34:27.429
Something in them
is making us weak and weird,

34:27.524 --> 34:29.641
building up in the body.

34:29.734 --> 34:31.896
And how do we know this?

34:33.196 --> 34:36.313
An Erebite heard Mr. Goodsir

34:36.408 --> 34:39.116
telling doctors MacDonald
and Peddie

34:39.202 --> 34:41.114
something of it at Carnivale.

34:43.081 --> 34:44.492
But no-one told you.

34:49.045 --> 34:50.706
But if that's true...

34:51.547 --> 34:53.540
what can we do about it?

34:53.632 --> 34:55.090
We've nothing else to eat.

34:55.176 --> 34:56.917
We're moving further south now.

34:58.013 --> 34:59.504
More chance
of running into game.

34:59.598 --> 35:01.305
Well, then, we'll be spared.

35:01.391 --> 35:04.099
Say we catch a ring seal.

35:04.185 --> 35:06.097
Let's say we catch three.

35:06.855 --> 35:08.938
Red meat.

35:10.025 --> 35:11.732
Fresh meat...

35:13.236 --> 35:15.353
that can get us off these tins.

35:15.447 --> 35:18.781
What happens on that day,
when you've finally got...

35:18.867 --> 35:20.950
a decent plate of meat
in front of you?

35:40.513 --> 35:42.379
Who is that?

35:43.600 --> 35:45.091
Who?

35:50.148 --> 35:53.061
It's... Lieutenant Hodgson,
it's not a man.

35:54.611 --> 35:56.648
Though it did belong to one.

35:57.989 --> 36:01.153
- What have you done?
- Just... keep listening.

36:02.035 --> 36:05.995
I know this will make sense to you.
Maybe only to you.

36:06.081 --> 36:08.198
With even this amount of meat,

36:08.291 --> 36:09.873
we could have a capital meal,

36:09.959 --> 36:12.702
right now, the three of us.

36:13.463 --> 36:15.876
We could make it last
several days.

36:16.800 --> 36:20.384
Under Crozier's plan,
we divide this... meat...

36:22.222 --> 36:23.713
into nearly 100 portions,

36:23.807 --> 36:25.924
until each of us
gets next to nothing.

36:26.017 --> 36:30.102
Even if we find game,
even bigger game than this,

36:30.188 --> 36:31.850
with the help of Crozier's...

36:33.149 --> 36:34.685
Esquimaux "friends"...

36:35.443 --> 36:38.060
it would have to be in
numbers we can all agree

36:38.154 --> 36:40.066
are next to impossible.

36:43.410 --> 36:46.244
Crozier's plan... is bootless.

36:50.750 --> 36:53.037
And you know it.

36:56.756 --> 36:58.622
God, blind me.

37:01.761 --> 37:04.094
You've made a mistake,
Mr. Hickey.

37:05.640 --> 37:07.848
This dog was our only alarm
against the creature.

37:07.934 --> 37:10.051
It broke its front leg
on the rocks.

37:10.145 --> 37:11.852
I found it.

37:13.815 --> 37:15.351
And I put it down.

37:16.776 --> 37:19.109
I'm not asking you
to believe me about that.

37:19.195 --> 37:20.857
What are you asking me?

37:22.782 --> 37:24.273
There will be a moment

37:24.367 --> 37:27.576
when the numbers make sense
to more of the men.

37:30.915 --> 37:32.451
And when that moment comes...

37:34.919 --> 37:37.161
we need an officer...

37:38.590 --> 37:40.331
who sees things clearly.

37:42.051 --> 37:43.713
I'm not a captain.

37:46.014 --> 37:47.471
I'm not made of that.

37:47.557 --> 37:49.924
You can be whatever
you need to be now.

37:53.897 --> 37:56.139
Survival is a nasty
piece of business.

37:57.692 --> 37:59.684
But we do what we have to do.

38:03.239 --> 38:05.026
We reconfigure.

38:05.116 --> 38:06.948
We reinvent.

38:07.911 --> 38:09.402
We rearrange.

38:10.830 --> 38:15.495
Let me be your lieutenant
in a new arrangement.

38:16.795 --> 38:18.787
Let us get out, together.

38:20.340 --> 38:22.673
Let's put our hope
in our own hands.

38:23.468 --> 38:25.334
Because what I have
to tell you next...

38:26.221 --> 38:29.385
is going to stamp out most
of the hope you've been given.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.940
A mate of mine was stationed
on a ship in Baffin Bay

38:44.030 --> 38:45.566
for two seasons

38:45.657 --> 38:48.741
and said caribou doesn't have
the tallow beef does.

38:49.410 --> 38:51.777
But the taste is strong...

38:51.871 --> 38:54.739
and tastes more strongly
of what is the animal's diet.

38:55.625 --> 38:57.617
Would that be rocks here, then?

38:58.962 --> 39:02.706
The word "diet"
comes from the Greek "diaita".

39:03.758 --> 39:05.499
"A way of life."

39:07.595 --> 39:10.258
We've an hour left
before we need to return.

39:10.348 --> 39:11.759
Let's cover more ground.

39:11.850 --> 39:14.433
I'll go east with Mr. Armitage
and Mr. Pocock.

39:16.688 --> 39:18.554
Farr, Hickey, you're with me.

39:20.066 --> 39:23.434
We'll go south,
walk half an hour, then turn back.

39:25.071 --> 39:27.063
We'll meet at this spot.

39:52.891 --> 39:54.382
Lieutenant.

40:02.233 --> 40:03.940
My God!

40:15.079 --> 40:16.570
Stay here.

40:18.833 --> 40:22.076
I'll approach them alone.
We don't want to spook them.

40:27.675 --> 40:29.712
The Captain said so, didn't he?

40:56.996 --> 40:58.862
My name is...

40:58.957 --> 41:02.496
Lieutenant John Irving...
of Her Majesty's Royal Navy.

41:16.557 --> 41:17.968
John.

41:29.278 --> 41:31.065
I'm John.

41:32.323 --> 41:33.814
Koveyook.

41:35.868 --> 41:37.325
Koveyook.

41:38.538 --> 41:40.825
- Koveyook.
- Koveyook.

41:40.915 --> 41:42.406
- Koveyook.
- John.

41:43.793 --> 41:45.910
John.

41:47.755 --> 41:48.916
John.

41:54.220 --> 41:56.428
Uh...

41:56.514 --> 41:59.507
My... My friends and I...
we are...

42:00.685 --> 42:02.017
are, uh...

42:02.103 --> 42:04.937
We're looking for game.

42:05.773 --> 42:06.889
Food.

42:07.608 --> 42:10.225
Food. Food. Food, yes.

42:10.319 --> 42:12.151
Yes. Um...

42:35.428 --> 42:37.511
Thank you.

42:49.484 --> 42:51.100
Thank you.

42:54.572 --> 42:56.108
Um...

43:23.684 --> 43:25.220
Uh...

43:27.146 --> 43:29.889
You... stay here.

43:30.942 --> 43:33.525
Please. You stay.

44:00.596 --> 44:02.007
What happened?

44:07.395 --> 44:09.387
Hickey!

44:09.480 --> 44:11.563
Hickey! Hickey!

44:59.780 --> 45:02.193
Head down.

45:03.868 --> 45:05.575
Welcome aboard, Mr. Morfin.

45:05.661 --> 45:07.527
Glad to be here, sir.

45:08.998 --> 45:10.739
Thank you. Head down.

45:23.221 --> 45:25.133
I see my signature here,
but I don't...

45:25.223 --> 45:26.634
Oh, I've grown a beard.

45:27.892 --> 45:29.599
- I thought it would be smart.
- Yes.

45:29.685 --> 45:31.176
It can't hurt, where we're off to.

45:31.270 --> 45:32.977
That's what I thought.

45:33.064 --> 45:35.147
- Head down.
- This way?

45:35.233 --> 45:36.394
- Yes.
- Thank you.

45:43.699 --> 45:45.361
Yes?

45:48.120 --> 45:50.328
Cornelius Hickey,
caulker's mate.

45:50.414 --> 45:52.155
Your new home, Mr. Hickey.

45:52.917 --> 45:55.751
Once you've unpacked, check in
with Mr. Darlington, the caulker.

45:55.836 --> 45:59.329
- He's on the orlop.
- The orlop, sir, is...

46:00.216 --> 46:01.423
Is it...?

46:01.509 --> 46:03.626
- The deck just below.
- Mm-hm.

46:03.719 --> 46:05.381
Have you been on a ship before?

46:06.138 --> 46:07.800
Not like this one, sir.

46:08.766 --> 46:10.758
A change of pace, then?

46:12.144 --> 46:13.726
A change of everything, sir.
