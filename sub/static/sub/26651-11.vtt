LESSON 3 HIDE YOUR TRAIL!

39:15.000 --> 39:17.120
Let me show you something.

39:28.360 --> 39:33.520
Suppose you're a large company
working with smaller companies.

39:33.600 --> 39:35.600
Smaller companies are there

39:35.680 --> 39:40.360
to hide your connection
to dodgy dealings.

39:40.440 --> 39:42.960
Obviously it's no good if
there's a direct connection

39:43.040 --> 39:45.360
between the large company
and the small companies

39:45.440 --> 39:49.000
that are doing the naughty things.

39:49.080 --> 39:51.240
You want to somehow

39:53.440 --> 39:55.120
create a disconnect

39:55.200 --> 39:59.080
between the large and
the small companies.

40:00.240 --> 40:02.440
So what you try to do

40:05.120 --> 40:09.880
is make a break between
the large and the small.

40:09.960 --> 40:12.480
Just cut the connection.

40:12.560 --> 40:14.560
So whatever the
small company does,

40:14.640 --> 40:17.200
it doesn't reflect badly
on the large company.

40:17.280 --> 40:20.240
Of course the
connection is still there.

40:21.600 --> 40:24.040
You just, you can't see it.

40:27.360 --> 40:29.280
One always had this
idea: it's socialism,

40:29.360 --> 40:31.200
people don't do that
kind of thing there.

40:31.280 --> 40:34.880
But if you're a faithful
Communist, so to speak,

40:34.960 --> 40:38.000
you want to bring in a
maximum to your own stores,

40:38.080 --> 40:40.680
and you are prepared to
use the enemy's resources.

40:40.760 --> 40:43.240
You have no ideological
problem with this

40:43.320 --> 40:45.840
because you say, "We're
going to win, anyway.

40:45.920 --> 40:47.320
So it's legitimate.

40:47.400 --> 40:49.000
And as long as capitalism exists,

40:49.080 --> 40:50.440
we're going to take
advantage of it."

40:50.520 --> 40:53.720
So it's only the petty-minded

40:53.800 --> 40:55.760
on the socialist side who say

40:55.840 --> 40:58.120
"We must abide perfectly
by the doctrine."

40:58.200 --> 40:59.480
Such people don't get it,

was, I was met at Tegel airport

that you are going to
send trains down here.

1:07:30.520 --> 1:07:33.600
every train is disappearing here,

1:07:33.680 --> 1:07:36.640

is sent out by boats

But I mean,

1:08:05.320 --> 1:08:07.680
it was way too much
for those purposes.

1:08:07.760 --> 1:08:10.680
So certainly there was
an export going on.

1:08:10.760 --> 1:08:13.280
Of course they
didn't tell me this.

1:08:30.760 --> 1:08:33.480
that they are going to Iran.

1:08:33.560 --> 1:08:35.320
Because they didn't
really have evidence.

1:08:35.400 --> 1:08:37.920
They had the suspicion
it was going to Iran,

1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:40.440
but they didn't really
have the evidence.

1:08:40.520 --> 1:08:42.320
Now with help of the
East German documents

1:08:42.400 --> 1:08:43.480
which we got hold of,

1:08:43.560 --> 1:08:46.040
we could fill in
the missing parts.

1:08:46.120 --> 1:08:47.960

we first understood

1:08:48.040 --> 1:08:50.080
how big this deal actually was.

1:08:50.160 --> 1:08:53.240

Yes, from East Germany.

RP13 had been reclassified

naturally then processed it all

1:11:56.640 --> 1:11:59.360

We're talking about several
hundred train loads.

NARRATOR: With all that gunpowder,

1:12:18.480 --> 1:12:21.400
East Germany could even
supply both warring parties.

1:12:21.480 --> 1:12:24.600
And the more one side got,
the more the other wanted.

1:12:24.680 --> 1:12:28.640
So the East Germans realized
they could not only supply Iran,

1:12:28.720 --> 1:12:31.080
they could also supply Iraq.

1:12:31.160 --> 1:12:35.760

to keep the war going.

1:12:45.520 --> 1:12:46.800
No one should win it.

1:12:46.880 --> 1:12:50.280

could export so much more.

but didn't you have a conscience?

1:13:03.080 --> 1:13:06.640
I mean, even if the
business was legal,

1:13:06.720 --> 1:13:08.880
don't you have any moral?

1:13:08.960 --> 1:13:11.920
Well, this is not an easy thing.

1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:14.000
The Bofors position
was that any business

1:13:14.080 --> 1:13:19.160
that can be done
legally shall be done:

1:13:19.240 --> 1:13:20.600
No morals.

1:13:20.680 --> 1:13:22.520
If the business is legal, do it.

1:13:22.600 --> 1:13:23.840
So East Germany is a winner

1:13:23.920 --> 1:13:27.520
and Bofors at Carlskoga
is a winner too.

1:13:27.600 --> 1:13:29.880
But the people who really lose,
they are not in the picture,

1:13:29.960 --> 1:13:31.200

1:13:31.280 --> 1:13:32.880

get killed in Iran

1:13:32.960 --> 1:13:34.640
and during the war with Iraq.

1:13:34.720 --> 1:13:36.480

NARRATOR: Within a few years,

1:14:28.680 --> 1:14:30.680
East Germany had
become a respected figure

1:14:30.760 --> 1:14:33.520
in the international arms trade.

1:14:33.600 --> 1:14:35.400
Business was so good

1:14:35.480 --> 1:14:36.840
that East Germany
didn't look too closely

1:14:36.920 --> 1:14:39.680
at who it was doing business with.

1:14:39.760 --> 1:14:42.960
Truth be told, it did
business with everyone,

1:14:43.040 --> 1:14:45.240
be it friend or foe.

1:14:45.320 --> 1:14:46.880
East Berlin was soon
the meeting point

1:14:46.960 --> 1:14:50.680
of the Who's Who of the
international arms trade.

1:14:50.760 --> 1:14:53.280
And so, in 1986,

1:14:53.360 --> 1:14:54.960
it even found itself
doing business

1:14:55.040 --> 1:14:56.440
with the archenemy, South Africa.

1:14:56.520 --> 1:14:59.120
Which brings us back
to the start of our story.

1:15:00.200 --> 1:15:02.400
While war raged in Angola

1:15:02.480 --> 1:15:04.200
and East Germany
supported the fight

1:15:04.280 --> 1:15:06.720
against the Apartheid
regime with all its vigor,

1:15:06.800 --> 1:15:11.200
a ship sailed from a harbor in
the north of East Germany.

1:15:11.280 --> 1:15:12.960
And so things took their course.

1:15:13.040 --> 1:15:14.920
(tanks rumbling)

1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:17.280
The middleman Georges Starckmann

1:15:17.360 --> 1:15:19.240
has been commissioned
by South Africa

1:15:19.320 --> 1:15:22.480
to buy weapons for
their war in Angola.

1:15:25.840 --> 1:15:29.280
The negotiations were very simple.

1:15:29.360 --> 1:15:31.680
We explained what
equipment we wanted

1:15:31.760 --> 1:15:33.040
and they answered:

1:15:33.120 --> 1:15:35.720
"We've got this, we
don't have that."

1:15:35.800 --> 1:15:38.400
They asked who the goods were for.

1:15:38.480 --> 1:15:42.600
And we told them the
truth or we said nothing.

1:15:42.680 --> 1:15:44.320
They understood this.

1:15:44.400 --> 1:15:47.400
Then we negotiated
prices and that was that.

1:15:47.480 --> 1:15:50.680
They issued an
invoice and we paid.

1:15:50.760 --> 1:15:53.240

government officials
in East Germany,

1:16:03.920 --> 1:16:05.400

1:16:05.480 --> 1:16:08.160
must have been aware of where
these weapons were going.

1:16:09.120 --> 1:16:11.360
(jet engine roaring)

1:16:11.440 --> 1:16:13.800
NARRATOR: Only the
story turned out different.

1:16:13.880 --> 1:16:16.840
Or at least to how the
South Africans imagined it.

1:16:16.920 --> 1:16:18.640
Because before Georges Starckmann

1:16:18.720 --> 1:16:19.840
flew to East Berlin,

1:16:19.920 --> 1:16:21.560
he had contacted the White House,

1:16:21.640 --> 1:16:23.160
a White House department

1:16:23.240 --> 1:16:24.960
that was under the
charge of this man.

1:16:25.040 --> 1:16:27.280
Oliver North.

1:16:27.360 --> 1:16:29.480
The White House was
against the Apartheid regime

1:16:29.560 --> 1:16:36.000
buying weapons to
wage war in Angola.

1:16:36.080 --> 1:16:38.160
The Americans were
against this war

1:16:38.240 --> 1:16:40.560
and wanted it to stop.

1:16:40.640 --> 1:16:42.640
And they were against Apartheid.

1:16:42.720 --> 1:16:43.960
But they said,

1:16:44.040 --> 1:16:46.000
"Okay, if the South Africans

1:16:46.080 --> 1:16:47.520
are already sending
money for weapons,

1:16:47.600 --> 1:16:50.880
we'll take the money and
support the Contras.

1:16:54.360 --> 1:16:58.320
They repurposed the
money from a project that

1:16:58.400 --> 1:17:00.720
the Americans didn't
support politically

1:17:00.800 --> 1:17:06.080
to a project that was
politically to their taste.

NARRATOR: That's how the
story took its decisive turn.

1:17:11.400 --> 1:17:13.560
The weapons South
Africa had paid for

1:17:13.640 --> 1:17:16.040
never set out in that direction.

1:17:16.120 --> 1:17:17.920
The ship, the Pia Vesta,

1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:21.640
crossed the Atlantic
heading west with a cargo

1:17:21.720 --> 1:17:24.920
that was destined for
a very different war.

1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:26.640
But even there it never arrived.

1:17:26.720 --> 1:17:30.880
In the port of Panama, its
mystery cargo was revealed

1:17:30.960 --> 1:17:35.120
and the world was
faced with an enigma.

1:17:35.200 --> 1:17:37.640
That the South
Africans felt cheated

1:17:37.720 --> 1:17:40.440
was a matter of indifference to
the comrades in East Berlin.

1:17:40.520 --> 1:17:41.800
They had their money

1:17:41.880 --> 1:17:44.200

of the arrangement.

1:17:44.280 --> 1:17:46.240
But despite the plan,

1:17:46.320 --> 1:17:48.520
it wasn't enough to
save East Germany.

1:17:48.600 --> 1:17:51.960
Three years after the
Pia Vesta came to light,

1:17:52.040 --> 1:17:53.840
the Wall fell in Berlin,

and with it, many of
its leaders' secrets.

1:17:59.040 --> 1:18:01.200
They sold more weapons to people

1:18:01.280 --> 1:18:03.080

1:18:03.160 --> 1:18:05.720
