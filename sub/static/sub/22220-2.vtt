WEBVTT

00:04.505 --> 00:10.876
(siren blaring)

00:22.148 --> 00:24.139
Where the Hezmana is that
siren coming from?

00:24.275 --> 00:26.231
Sounds like from the
inside of my head.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.736
What the Hezmana is it?

00:27.862 --> 00:29.898
It's definitely Peacekeeper.

00:30.031 --> 00:31.111
And don't do that at me.

00:31.240 --> 00:31.945
What?

00:32.074 --> 00:33.735
That... that...

00:33.868 --> 00:35.074
I can't help it.

00:35.203 --> 00:37.865
The sound frequency's doing
something to my eye.

00:39.498 --> 00:42.831
Feels like it's melting
my brain.

00:42.960 --> 00:44.916
It couldn't actually be doing
something to my brain, could it?

00:45.046 --> 00:48.288
DRDs have located the siren's
point of origin.

00:48.424 --> 00:50.881
Tier seven, rear storage
compartment.

00:51.010 --> 00:51.999
Zhaan:
We're there, Pilot.

00:52.136 --> 00:53.421
The DRDs are removing
the cover now.

00:53.554 --> 00:56.387
Rygel:
Can't you stop that noise?

01:05.983 --> 01:07.598
Let me see.

01:39.267 --> 01:40.302
(siren stops)

01:40.434 --> 01:41.389
Pilot, good work.

01:41.519 --> 01:42.725
You've stopped it.

01:42.853 --> 01:44.684
l have only neutralized
the internal sound.

01:44.814 --> 01:49.729
The device itself is still
broadcasting some kind of
signal into deep space

01:49.860 --> 01:52.397
using Moya's hull
as a maximizer.

01:52.530 --> 01:54.521
It's using my skull
as a maximizer.

01:54.657 --> 01:56.397
Why am I still twitching?

01:56.534 --> 01:58.115
It's a Paddac Beacon.

01:58.244 --> 02:02.203
It starts broadcasting unless it
gets a regular signal from the
Control Collar.

02:02.331 --> 02:03.867
Which we removed.

02:06.502 --> 02:08.788
And why didn't you tell
us about this?

02:08.921 --> 02:10.877
Well, not all Leviathan
transports have them.

02:11.007 --> 02:12.463
I had no way of knowing.

02:12.591 --> 02:15.924
Look, I'm new to all this
escaped prisoner crap,
all right?

02:18.931 --> 02:20.216
Oh, no...

02:26.397 --> 02:27.853
It won't let DRDs near it.

02:27.982 --> 02:31.395
Pilot:
The external broadcast is
increasing exponentially.

02:31.527 --> 02:34.690
If there's a Peacekeeper patrol
within a quarter light cycle

02:34.822 --> 02:37.529
they'll know exactly
where we are.

02:39.618 --> 02:42.530
Aeryn, can the device
be removed?

02:43.331 --> 02:44.912
I'll get it out.

02:55.551 --> 02:57.542
Zhaan:
Pilot, can the device
be removed?

02:57.678 --> 02:59.669
I'm running diagnostics now.

02:59.805 --> 03:02.217
Even if it can be removed,
it will take time.

03:02.350 --> 03:07.595
Meanwhile, we're broadcasting
our position like a two-headed
Tronkan shrill singer.

03:07.730 --> 03:10.267
Look, if we can't remove
it, can't we at least
muffle it somehow

03:10.399 --> 03:11.900
lessen the signal strength?

03:12.026 --> 03:13.857
It is using all of Moya's hull.

03:13.986 --> 03:17.774
John, there is no way to
insulate Moya's entire
outer skin.

03:17.907 --> 03:19.772
Pilot, shut down power
to this section.

03:19.909 --> 03:22.696
That is Moya's primary
neural nexus.

03:22.828 --> 03:25.319
I cannot shut that down.

03:27.583 --> 03:29.198
Water.

03:30.586 --> 03:34.625
Wa... Pilot, this system
we're passing through,
the middle planet.

03:34.757 --> 03:36.247
It's got water, right?

03:36.384 --> 03:38.921
30% surface moisture.

03:39.053 --> 03:42.216
Not so much water as... bog.

03:42.348 --> 03:43.098
Fine, fine. Bog.

03:43.224 --> 03:46.307
We'll use the bog as insulation.

03:46.435 --> 03:49.097
What, and take Moya down on
to the planet's surface?

03:49.230 --> 03:51.471
She can do that, right?

03:51.607 --> 03:52.517
Right?

03:52.650 --> 03:54.060
(snons)

03:55.611 --> 03:56.600
Pilot?

03:56.737 --> 03:59.319
When Leviathans are young

03:59.448 --> 04:02.360
they often play with a
planet's gravity.

04:02.493 --> 04:04.233
See how close they can come.

04:04.370 --> 04:07.203
There's a tale told about
an adult male

04:07.331 --> 04:09.947
who once touched down on
a planet's surface...

04:10.084 --> 04:15.078
though, no one knows if
it's true or not.

04:15.214 --> 04:16.954
Well, if she can't, she can't.

04:17.091 --> 04:21.710
We can stick our heads between
our legs and kiss our
asses good-bye.

04:24.932 --> 04:27.218
It's a saying.

04:33.399 --> 04:36.482
Wait! Wait! I'm not ready! Oh!

04:40.239 --> 04:41.729
(groaning)

04:41.866 --> 04:45.233
Somebody help tie me down.

04:47.663 --> 04:49.199
Pilot, how is Moya doing?

04:49.331 --> 04:52.664
Atmospheric friction within
tolerable limits

04:52.793 --> 04:55.079
but she's starting to
feel the gravity.

04:55.212 --> 04:57.168
Definitely feeling the
increased weight.

04:57.298 --> 05:00.506
Just put it down in that
swamp we targeted.

05:02.303 --> 05:03.509
Aeryn:
It's probably not going
to matter much.

05:03.637 --> 05:06.424
But you'd better get yourself
in position for "landing."

05:06.557 --> 05:08.969
That looks like Earth.

05:14.315 --> 05:16.226
Pilot:
Brace yourselves.

05:23.407 --> 05:24.692
(whimpering)

05:36.295 --> 05:37.410
(grunts)

05:49.642 --> 05:52.930
(groaning)

05:54.355 --> 05:56.016
We're down.

05:56.148 --> 05:58.264
Moya has... landed.

06:00.319 --> 06:02.981
Am I the only one seeing this?

06:03.113 --> 06:04.273
We're sinking!

06:04.406 --> 06:07.569
(birds calling)

06:07.701 --> 06:12.365
(ship creaking)

06:21.257 --> 06:23.339
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut...

06:23.467 --> 06:26.925
...a radiation wave hit and I
got shot through a wormhole...

06:27.054 --> 06:29.215
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe

06:29.348 --> 06:30.713
On a ship-- a living ship

06:30.849 --> 06:33.226
Full of strange alien
life-forms...

06:33.352 --> 06:34.216
Help me...

06:34.353 --> 06:35.388
Listen, please.

06:35.521 --> 06:37.432
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

06:37.565 --> 06:41.433
I'm being hunted by an insane
military commander...

06:41.569 --> 06:43.730
...doing everything I can...

06:43.862 --> 06:46.274
I'm just looking for
a way home.

07:05.884 --> 07:08.375
(birds calling)

07:11.307 --> 07:13.423
(rumbling)

07:15.311 --> 07:16.300
Pilot, does that mean we've...?

07:16.437 --> 07:17.677
...stopped sinking?

07:17.813 --> 07:21.806
Yes. We're almost
completely submerged.

07:29.116 --> 07:29.901
You okay?

07:30.034 --> 07:32.650
Okay? No, I'm not okay.

07:32.786 --> 07:35.949
We're in the mud...
under the mud.

07:36.081 --> 07:37.161
Aeryn:
You're Hynerian.

07:37.291 --> 07:39.873
You're aquatic.
What's your problem?

07:40.002 --> 07:42.709
Aquatic-- that's water, not mud.

07:42.838 --> 07:44.874
Mud is mud.

07:45.007 --> 07:46.122
You can't breathe in it.

07:46.258 --> 07:47.418
You can't move in it.

07:47.551 --> 07:48.381
It holds you.

07:48.510 --> 07:49.090
lt grabs you.

07:49.219 --> 07:50.299
It sucks you down.

07:50.429 --> 07:51.760
You want to know about mud?

07:51.889 --> 07:54.380
I know about mud.

07:54.767 --> 07:56.132
Guy knows mud.

07:56.268 --> 07:57.769
And the beacon?

07:57.895 --> 07:58.805
M uffled.

07:58.937 --> 08:01.428
The mud's insulating the
transmission.

08:03.901 --> 08:05.186
And how's Moya?

08:05.319 --> 08:07.651
Very scared.

08:10.282 --> 08:13.820
Aeryn:
This beacon was hastily
installed.

08:16.622 --> 08:20.114
So, we just cut it out of there
and we can fly off this
blasted planet.

08:20.250 --> 08:21.956
I told you, it won't let
DRDs near it.

08:22.086 --> 08:24.748
Crichton:
Well, somebody's got to
go in there.

08:26.215 --> 08:28.126
( groans )

08:28.258 --> 08:32.217
Oh, no. You covered me in mud
because I have no say

08:32.346 --> 08:36.305
but in this, l have a say,
and I say no.

08:36.433 --> 08:39.095
Get someone else to do
your dirty work.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.262
He'll do it.

08:43.399 --> 08:48.109
With apologies but that is
Moya's primary neural nexus.

08:48.237 --> 08:50.649
It is an intensely
sensitive area.

08:50.781 --> 08:52.396
Well, how sensitive
is sensitive?

08:52.533 --> 08:55.149
Look, she's just going to
have to endure it.

08:55.285 --> 08:56.491
Could you be a little sensitive?

08:56.620 --> 08:58.611
Can we cut this thing out?

08:58.747 --> 09:01.580
The level of pain will
be intolerable.

09:01.709 --> 09:03.540
She may die.

09:06.922 --> 09:09.254
Pilot, is there any kind
of anesthetic.

09:09.383 --> 09:12.125
Something we could use to apply
to ease Moya's pain?

09:12.261 --> 09:13.876
An anesthetic?

09:14.012 --> 09:15.388
For a Leviathan?

09:15.514 --> 09:18.927
There is without question
no such...

09:20.811 --> 09:22.017
Pilot?

09:23.105 --> 09:24.060
Clorium.

09:24.189 --> 09:25.178
Clorium?
Clorium?

09:25.315 --> 09:26.475
Zhaan:
It's an element.

09:26.608 --> 09:29.190
It is one of the six
forbidden cargoes.

09:29.319 --> 09:34.063
Leviathans cannot transport it
because it numbs them.

09:34.199 --> 09:35.234
Is there any on board?

09:35.367 --> 09:36.948
Never.

09:37.703 --> 09:39.239
It's a very common element.

09:39.371 --> 09:40.486
It's found in many forms.

09:40.622 --> 09:44.114
It's an atmospherically
induced isotope of twinium.

09:44.251 --> 09:46.162
Is there any out there?

09:49.631 --> 09:52.464
Yo, Aeryn, let's go.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.963
Hey, come on.
This is your chance to
flex those big,

09:56.096 --> 09:58.712
Peacekeeper commando muscles
out in the field.

09:58.849 --> 10:00.965
"Peacekeeper commando."

10:01.101 --> 10:03.137
Yeah, really.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.852
Is there a problem?

10:06.482 --> 10:08.973
Oh, I find and explain

10:09.109 --> 10:12.226
our top-secret tracking device
to a bunch of escaped prisoners

10:12.362 --> 10:14.148
and then lead a mission
to destroy it.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.647
Number one, you're not
leading the mission;

10:16.784 --> 10:20.117
Number two, those Peacekeepers
you're so concerned about

10:20.245 --> 10:22.156
they'd kill you right now.
It was the Peacekeepers...

10:22.289 --> 10:24.826
...turned on me for speaking
up for you.

10:24.958 --> 10:28.416
I don't know what
I was thinking.

10:28.545 --> 10:31.036
Well, back home we call it
being stand-up.

10:31.173 --> 10:34.040
Well, I stood up and | no
longer have a home.

10:34.176 --> 10:36.258
Well, join the club.

10:38.764 --> 10:42.256
Hey, does this bother you?

10:42.392 --> 10:45.179
Because it bugs the crap
out of me.

10:45.312 --> 10:50.306
So can we go, before we become
a permanent tourist attraction
in this bog?

10:50.442 --> 10:54.310
And my eye falls out? Jeez!

11:21.306 --> 11:23.262
Crichton:
It's kind of like Louisiana.

11:25.894 --> 11:27.725
Or Dagobah.

11:29.898 --> 11:32.981
Dagobah-- where Yoda lives.

11:33.443 --> 11:35.695
Who's Yoda?

11:36.488 --> 11:38.353
Just a little green guy.

11:38.490 --> 11:40.822
Trains warriors.

11:40.951 --> 11:42.987
Oh.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.842
This particle analyzer
is defective.

12:00.971 --> 12:03.713
It's Peacekeeper technology--
you use it.

12:03.849 --> 12:05.339
Techs use them, not infantry.

12:05.475 --> 12:10.765
Pilot said you press this,
this and... this.

12:11.982 --> 12:16.225
Well, it's just like a VCR...
except easier.

12:17.112 --> 12:18.522
Whoa. Whoa. We got something.

12:18.655 --> 12:20.270
Aeryn:
That's a weak reading.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.568
At that level we'll have to
bring back half the planet.

12:22.701 --> 12:26.159
We need to find a
concentrated source.

12:26.288 --> 12:28.244
(engine humming)

12:28.373 --> 12:29.988
What's that?

12:30.792 --> 12:32.783
What the hell is that?

12:36.548 --> 12:39.290
Aeryn:
Vehicle! Take cover!

12:45.766 --> 12:46.755
(men shouting )

12:46.892 --> 12:49.474
Can we get some light here?

12:49.603 --> 12:51.719
(animals barking )

12:51.855 --> 12:53.220
I swear I saw it.

12:53.357 --> 12:54.813
Nile Yunn said he saw it, too--
him and his wife.

12:54.942 --> 12:56.603
Big as two mallac fields.

12:56.735 --> 12:58.896
Came in low over the banja trees
like they was no bigger
than jaw picks.

12:59.029 --> 13:01.941
There's hascann and his sons
and the bosk twins!

13:02.074 --> 13:04.030
Let's see what's what.

13:12.250 --> 13:13.706
We need to draw them
away from the ship.

13:13.835 --> 13:15.291
We need clorium.

13:15.420 --> 13:17.331
Aeryn and I will distract them.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.170
You find the clorium

13:19.299 --> 13:21.676
and we'll all meet back
at the ship.

13:29.935 --> 13:31.846
Man:
Hey, over here.

13:35.482 --> 13:38.269
(roaring)

13:38.402 --> 13:39.482
Over there!

13:39.611 --> 13:40.771
There he is!

13:40.904 --> 13:42.860
I think I got him!

13:42.990 --> 13:44.105
(yelling)

13:44.241 --> 13:46.402
(guns firing)

14:00.424 --> 14:02.085
Pilot, did you send for me?

14:02.217 --> 14:04.799
l have completed tracing
the connection points

14:04.928 --> 14:08.011
between the Peacekeeper beacon
and Moya's neural system.

14:08.140 --> 14:09.300
Yes?

14:09.433 --> 14:12.300
The interlacing is
extremely intricate.

14:14.646 --> 14:17.308
Pilot, how did the Peacekeepers
ever get such a device aboard

14:17.441 --> 14:19.352
without you or Moya knowing
about it?

14:19.484 --> 14:22.772
Eh... hmm...

14:22.904 --> 14:26.146
When Peacekeepers capture a
Leviathan

14:26.283 --> 14:31.073
they immediately administer a
sleep agent-- very potent.

14:31.204 --> 14:38.576
The weak, the old do not survive
which, I suppose, is part
of its purpose.

14:38.712 --> 14:42.330
While the Leviathan sleeps the
Control Collar is set in place

14:42.466 --> 14:45.583
and modifications are made in
propulsion and guidance.

14:45.719 --> 14:51.680
I... thought I had discovered
all they had done to Moya.

14:51.808 --> 14:54.345
Obviously, I had not.

14:55.437 --> 14:57.302
Pilot, don't blame yourself.

14:57.439 --> 14:59.179
I'm afraid even with the clorium

14:59.316 --> 15:01.853
there will not be enough time
to complete the separation

15:01.985 --> 15:05.603
before Moya succumbs to her
own intense weight.

15:38.230 --> 15:41.688
( high-pitched beeping )

15:47.322 --> 15:49.062
Okay, clorium...

15:57.082 --> 15:59.243
Fertilizer?

16:05.507 --> 16:06.872
( beeping stops)

16:08.885 --> 16:13.003
This stuff could have been made
on Earth.

16:19.312 --> 16:22.975
Okay, maybe not.

16:23.108 --> 16:23.893
Crichton!

16:24.025 --> 16:25.811
Shh! yeah, I'm here.

16:25.944 --> 16:27.275
Aeryn:
Where are you?

16:27.404 --> 16:28.894
Where are you guys?
I'm in some kind of barn.

16:29.030 --> 16:30.861
-l'm with D'argo.
-Fine. You go.

16:30.991 --> 16:34.074
We're half a metra from the
ship-- still drawing fire
from the locals.

16:34.202 --> 16:35.658
Have you got the clorium yet?

16:35.787 --> 16:36.902
No, not yet.

16:41.418 --> 16:44.080
I'd feel a whole lot better if
we could hook up again.

16:46.423 --> 16:47.378
(gunfire echoing )

16:47.507 --> 16:49.043
Where are you guys?

16:49.176 --> 16:51.713
(gunfire and shouting over comm)

17:00.395 --> 17:03.307
(metal rattling )

17:04.858 --> 17:06.974
Who's there?

17:14.743 --> 17:15.903
Who are you?

17:16.036 --> 17:18.402
What are you doing around
my mom's stuff?

17:24.377 --> 17:27.460
Don't be afraid.

17:30.217 --> 17:32.333
I'm not going to hurt you.

17:39.100 --> 17:41.091
Where are you from?

17:41.228 --> 17:45.767
Um, I'm from a long...
long way away.

17:46.775 --> 17:48.686
You're from space?

17:48.818 --> 17:51.400
Yeah. I guess lam.

17:55.492 --> 17:56.948
So what's your name?

17:57.077 --> 17:58.157
Fostro.

17:58.286 --> 18:00.993
Well Fostro, my name is John.

18:02.499 --> 18:04.330
Fostro, wait! wait!

18:05.001 --> 18:06.866
Mom! Mom!

18:17.597 --> 18:19.258
It's not a weapon.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.515
I'm putting it down. Just...

18:22.644 --> 18:24.305
putting it down.

18:25.438 --> 18:26.518
Woman:
Fostro?

18:27.774 --> 18:28.604
Is that your mom?

18:28.733 --> 18:30.769
-Mom!
-No! Fostro, no!

18:36.783 --> 18:38.068
( grunts weakly)

18:38.201 --> 18:39.532
I can't move.

18:39.661 --> 18:41.743
Woman:
Fostro...
lam in the middle of what

18:41.871 --> 18:44.453
could be a very real
extraterrestrial event.

18:44.582 --> 18:46.868
This is not the moment
for you to...

18:51.214 --> 18:53.421
Why can't I move?

18:57.429 --> 18:59.920
I can't feel my body!

19:01.725 --> 19:04.558
Oh, my Gods.

19:04.686 --> 19:09.646
All my bones are...

19:11.818 --> 19:15.060
I'm going to recover
from this, right?

19:15.196 --> 19:16.185
Completely, right?

19:16.323 --> 19:18.609
Fostro, get back.

19:28.960 --> 19:30.245
Not another...

19:30.378 --> 19:31.413
step.

19:33.423 --> 19:35.209
Please, I already told your boy

19:35.342 --> 19:37.333
I'm not here to harm you.

19:38.178 --> 19:40.134
Where are you from?

19:40.263 --> 19:41.628
He's from space.

19:41.765 --> 19:45.178
He must have come down in that
thing you were tracking
last night.

19:45.310 --> 19:48.677
My name is John Crichton

19:48.813 --> 19:51.805
and I'm from...

19:52.567 --> 19:55.024
I'm talking to an alien?

19:55.153 --> 19:58.190
You're an alien, and I'm
talking to you?

19:58.323 --> 19:59.187
In my kitchen?

19:59.324 --> 20:01.030
Fostro:
You got to call somebody, Mom.

20:01.159 --> 20:02.444
Go outside. Get in the wheeler.

20:02.577 --> 20:03.566
Get in the wheeler now.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.534
Outside. Now.

20:05.663 --> 20:09.201
Hey, wait, you don't think
we came alone, do you?

20:09.334 --> 20:15.955
If we wanted to contact some
government, some agency
we would have.

20:16.091 --> 20:17.877
We chose you.

20:25.350 --> 20:28.842
If this is about me climbing
around in the ship's entrails

20:28.978 --> 20:32.971
then you can simply turn 'round
and go back the way you came.

20:33.108 --> 20:35.394
With permission, your eminence.

20:35.527 --> 20:36.812
Yes.

20:36.945 --> 20:38.481
Pilot's done all that he can

20:38.613 --> 20:42.151
but the device won't allow a DRD
or anything metal near it.

20:42.283 --> 20:44.148
We can't wait till the
others return.

20:44.285 --> 20:47.903
We have to start the separation
procedure immediately.

20:48.039 --> 20:51.873
And what about the
great ship's pain?

20:53.920 --> 20:57.458
Among my sect, I am a
ninth-level Pa'u.

20:57.590 --> 21:01.128
A priest of that level can
harbor the power to...

21:01.261 --> 21:04.344
share another being's pain.

21:04.472 --> 21:06.337
If you are willing to begin
the procedure

21:06.474 --> 21:10.763
I'll do all that I can to
alleviate Moya's discomfort.

21:12.439 --> 21:16.808
This... is an awfully big ship.

21:16.943 --> 21:19.104
Don't I know it.

21:39.257 --> 21:42.465
Careful, Peacekeeper.

21:44.012 --> 21:45.798
Peacekeepeh

21:45.930 --> 21:50.264
If I were still a Peacekeeper,
would I be sitting on this
planet next to you?

21:56.232 --> 21:58.223
It's been long enough.
I say we go.

21:58.359 --> 21:59.735
Not quite yet.

21:59.861 --> 22:01.397
Those hounds are still
out there.

22:01.529 --> 22:03.065
They could track us down
in a second.

22:03.198 --> 22:05.780
Oh, fine. Let'sjust perch here
and do nothing then.

22:05.909 --> 22:09.117
Listen, Aeryn, if you have a
problem with my strategy...

22:09.245 --> 22:14.831
Oh, I should have known that
this would be Luxan strategy.

22:14.959 --> 22:17.541
It's probably why you did so
well against the Grisoldians.

22:17.670 --> 22:19.285
Grisoldians?

22:19.422 --> 22:20.537
What do you know of them?

22:20.673 --> 22:22.538
Oh, everyone knows about
that battle.

22:22.675 --> 22:25.667
How the Luxans went screaming
into retreat so fast...

22:25.803 --> 22:29.887
Those monsters murdered
thousands of Luxan women
and children.

22:30.016 --> 22:33.099
We had no alternative
but to retreat.

22:33.228 --> 22:34.934
We soon took our revenge.

22:35.063 --> 22:39.102
Mmm, and murdered thousands of
their women and children.

22:39.234 --> 22:41.099
We had no alternative
to that either.

22:41.236 --> 22:44.774
Mmm, I'm sure the Grisoldians
said the same thing.

22:47.825 --> 22:51.033
Crichton:
I'm here because I
need something

22:51.162 --> 22:52.117
something for my ship.

22:52.247 --> 22:54.283
Where is your ship?

22:54.415 --> 22:56.155
It's not far from here.

22:57.752 --> 22:59.913
There are others like you?

23:00.046 --> 23:02.207
Like me?

23:03.216 --> 23:06.208
Well, there are others, yeah.

23:06.344 --> 23:09.131
My readings flew way
off the chart.

23:09.264 --> 23:11.505
The whole town is buzzing
about this...

23:11.641 --> 23:15.975
giant something that flew in
low over Kazda's Swamp.

23:16.104 --> 23:18.470
That's where your ship is--

23:18.606 --> 23:20.471
Kazda's Swamp.

23:20.608 --> 23:22.109
Mom, we got to tell.

23:22.235 --> 23:23.566
Fostro!

23:23.695 --> 23:26.983
Look, I understand what a
phenomenal moment this
is for you.

23:30.076 --> 23:31.236
Can you?

23:31.369 --> 23:36.204
I mean, to you, space travel is
commonplace but to us here...

23:36.332 --> 23:38.197
I mean, in one flash...

23:38.334 --> 23:41.292
You've learned that you're not
alone in the universe.

23:41.421 --> 23:43.127
That interstellar space
travel's possible.

23:43.256 --> 23:47.044
That a zillion of your empirical
facts about science,
religion are wrong,

23:47.176 --> 23:50.418
or... completely suspect.

23:53.224 --> 23:54.964
I do understand.

23:57.437 --> 24:01.806
I'm not... exactly what you
expected, am I?

24:01.941 --> 24:04.557
| always thought that when we
finally made contact--

24:04.694 --> 24:06.230
first contact--

24:06.362 --> 24:10.025
the beings we'd meet would be
so radically different.

24:10.867 --> 24:12.198
You're so much like us.

24:12.327 --> 24:15.444
Yeah, it's a real kick in
the pants, ain't it?

24:21.377 --> 24:25.120
So, have you been...
searching long?

24:25.256 --> 24:27.542
Since I was Fostro's age.

24:27.675 --> 24:29.711
My parents bought me
a telescope.

24:29.844 --> 24:35.180
| used to look up at the stars
at night and dream about...

24:35.308 --> 24:36.798
this moment.

24:38.561 --> 24:40.392
You said you chose me.

24:41.564 --> 24:44.647
Well, we saw the radio
telescopes and...

24:44.776 --> 24:48.234
we figured you might be
somebody who'd understand
us, not hurt us.

24:49.072 --> 24:50.733
Hoped you would be.

24:54.327 --> 24:57.285
You have, uh, star charts...

24:58.623 --> 24:59.908
and deep-space photographs?

25:00.041 --> 25:01.656
Yeah.

25:01.793 --> 25:04.034
There's a...

25:04.170 --> 25:06.832
chance I might recognize
something--

25:06.964 --> 25:08.249
constellations, galaxies.

25:08.383 --> 25:12.626
I might even get a fix on the
Milky Way maybe even Earth.

25:12.762 --> 25:15.344
Don't you even know where
you are?

25:18.267 --> 25:19.848
(rygel grunting)

25:19.977 --> 25:21.683
Are you in position?

25:21.813 --> 25:25.351
Yes, I'm in position.

25:25.483 --> 25:28.190
What is this thing I have
to cut with?

25:28.319 --> 25:30.901
Well, you can't use
a metal tool.

25:31.030 --> 25:32.816
I found that in D'argo's
quarters.

25:32.949 --> 25:34.189
I believe it's made from bone.

25:34.325 --> 25:37.067
( gasps ):
oh!

25:37.203 --> 25:38.864
This is a Tokaar knife.

25:38.996 --> 25:42.739
Do you know what ceremony
young Luxan males use this for?

25:42.875 --> 25:44.456
On themselves?

25:44.585 --> 25:46.997
At that... certain age?

25:47.130 --> 25:50.463
Then I suspect that D'argo will
want it back unharmed.

25:50.591 --> 25:52.798
(sighs)

25:55.096 --> 25:56.085
Are you ready?

25:56.222 --> 25:58.804
Yes, I'm ready.

26:05.523 --> 26:08.811
Moya, I will take your pain.

26:13.865 --> 26:15.105
You may begin.

26:15.241 --> 26:17.903
(inhales)

26:18.035 --> 26:19.366
Here goes.

26:20.246 --> 26:24.285
(groaning)

26:24.417 --> 26:27.204
Continue.
Rygel, you must continue.

26:36.637 --> 26:39.253
Aeryn:
This place reminds him of home.

26:39.390 --> 26:40.300
D'Argo:
What?

26:40.433 --> 26:43.095
Crichton. He says that
this primordial rock

26:43.227 --> 26:46.719
actually reminds him
of his Earth.

26:46.856 --> 26:50.895
No interplanetary travel,
retrograde technology,

26:51.027 --> 26:53.894
fossil fuel-burning
ground vehicles.

26:54.030 --> 26:55.440
He is a savage.

26:55.573 --> 26:57.313
Hmm.

26:59.160 --> 27:00.320
Does that bother you?

27:00.453 --> 27:04.742
No. Of course not.

27:04.874 --> 27:07.832
Look, he's had plenty of time
to find the clorium.
I'm going back.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.746
Signal me immediately if
he's there.

27:09.879 --> 27:11.915
And if he's not there?

27:12.048 --> 27:14.289
I will go find him.

27:15.218 --> 27:16.879
You think I will not?

27:17.011 --> 27:20.344
I think I'll be searching for
both of you in less
than an arne.

27:21.265 --> 27:22.926
Fostro, it's almost ready.

27:23.059 --> 27:24.299
But, mom, I'm not hungry.

27:24.435 --> 27:27.142
You haven't had breakfast
and you're going to eat!

27:31.025 --> 27:36.019
So, you, uh... work for
some kind of school?

27:37.615 --> 27:39.276
University?

27:39.408 --> 27:40.488
Military.

27:40.618 --> 27:43.610
They provide most of my funding
what's left of it.

27:43.746 --> 27:47.284
According to them, it's highly
unlikely you even exist.

27:49.377 --> 27:51.038
You're my biggest concern.

27:51.170 --> 27:53.707
I'm not quite sure how they'd
treat you if they knew
you were here.

27:53.840 --> 27:58.129
Our military isn't the most
compassionate, tolerant group.

27:59.262 --> 28:01.548
No. Militaries rarely are.

28:05.434 --> 28:07.174
So I'd be a real coup for you?

28:07.311 --> 28:08.926
( chuckles softly )

28:09.063 --> 28:12.851
Walking, talking evidence of
extraterrestrial life?

28:12.984 --> 28:16.977
Yeah, I'd say my funding would
be pretty much set for life.

28:17.113 --> 28:18.444
Fostro?

28:20.658 --> 28:22.364
I made some for you.

28:22.493 --> 28:24.074
Uh, I don't know if you eat.

28:24.203 --> 28:26.114
Don't even know if
you're hungry.

28:26.247 --> 28:29.114
Hell, for all I know this stuff
could be horribly toxic for you.

28:29.250 --> 28:30.205
( beeping )

28:30.334 --> 28:31.449
Aah! What was that?

28:31.586 --> 28:34.168
Oh, no, no, no, it's
just an analyzer.

28:34.297 --> 28:35.787
It's a science tool.

28:35.923 --> 28:39.836
It tells me there's some of what
I need somewhere near here.

28:39.969 --> 28:42.426
( higher-pitched beeping )

28:44.015 --> 28:45.471
It's in the food?

28:45.600 --> 28:48.433
How can it be in the...?

28:48.561 --> 28:50.847
Look, I'm looking for an
element called clorium.

28:50.980 --> 28:52.265
It's what I'm looking for

28:52.398 --> 28:55.765
and there's got to be some
somewhere here in this...

28:57.528 --> 28:59.314
( higher-pitched beeping )

28:59.447 --> 29:01.608
What the hell is this?

29:05.202 --> 29:06.237
What is this?

29:06.370 --> 29:10.704
(whimpering)

29:15.296 --> 29:20.256
Gee, I'm... I'm sorry.

29:20.384 --> 29:22.591
( soft gasp )

29:26.265 --> 29:29.473
Look, whatever is in
this container...

29:29.602 --> 29:32.264
this is what my ship needs.

29:34.690 --> 29:37.682
(vehicle approaching )

29:39.987 --> 29:42.820
It's the military.

29:43.699 --> 29:45.610
Man:
Lyneea?

29:48.204 --> 29:49.944
Fostro, take him to your room.

29:50.081 --> 29:51.787
-Go!
-But, mom...

29:51.916 --> 29:54.282
-No. You don't have to do...
-Go!

29:56.629 --> 29:59.962
(grunting)

30:06.555 --> 30:09.922
Moya is in intense pain.

30:13.020 --> 30:14.226
(groaning)

30:15.272 --> 30:17.228
Zhaan?

30:19.276 --> 30:22.439
Zhaan! Zhaan!

30:25.992 --> 30:28.699
Pilot, I think Zhaan is...

30:30.246 --> 30:31.861
Pilot?

30:33.040 --> 30:34.075
Pilot?

30:34.208 --> 30:36.540
(voice echoing ):
Pilot!

30:39.547 --> 30:40.787
Wake up!

30:40.923 --> 30:44.381
Wake up you worthless weak
shank of blue flesh!

30:51.559 --> 30:53.299
Pilot:
Are you there?

30:53.436 --> 30:54.300
Are you there?

30:54.437 --> 30:54.926
Pilot?

30:54.979 --> 30:55.729
Anyone there?

30:55.855 --> 30:57.095
Yes, of course, we're here.

30:57.231 --> 31:00.189
I've been screaming my
shaltan head off!

31:00.317 --> 31:02.444
(moaning)

31:04.113 --> 31:06.650
Moya is succumbing.

31:09.243 --> 31:12.576
She's collapsing.

31:27.261 --> 31:31.800
You know, when l was your age,
I used to dream of meeting
a real, live alien.

31:33.267 --> 31:35.258
Yeah. Me, too.

31:37.313 --> 31:38.393
Your phone's broken?

31:38.522 --> 31:40.604
I dropped it in all the
excitement when we thought...

31:40.733 --> 31:41.722
"Thought" nothing.

31:41.859 --> 31:43.224
We had confirmation this time.

31:43.360 --> 31:46.147
Mount Versant observatory says
that something definitely

31:46.280 --> 31:49.192
punched through the upper
atmosphere last night.

31:51.327 --> 31:52.282
This means so little to you?

31:52.411 --> 31:54.151
| just remember last year.

31:54.288 --> 31:57.576
Versant declared a definite
U.E.O. sighting.

31:57.708 --> 32:00.370
Turned out to be a
terrestrial anomaly.

32:00.503 --> 32:01.413
Anomaly?

32:01.545 --> 32:03.046
That's not what you reported
earlier.

32:03.172 --> 32:05.208
ljust want to be sure.

32:05.341 --> 32:07.673
I need more time to
check my data.

32:07.802 --> 32:10.965
There is definitely something
out there, Lyneea.

32:11.097 --> 32:12.928
Civilians have seen it.

32:13.057 --> 32:17.972
This is the day you prove all of
us who doubted you wrong.

32:18.854 --> 32:20.640
I don't understand.

32:20.773 --> 32:24.140
When you first contacted me you
were extremely excited about
your readings.

32:24.276 --> 32:26.187
I'm still excited.

32:26.320 --> 32:29.187
No. You're nervous.

32:40.292 --> 32:42.374
It looks like they're making
this their base of operations.

32:42.503 --> 32:45.210
Well, it's standard procedure
during an actual event

32:45.339 --> 32:47.375
and they know it's real
this time.

32:48.551 --> 32:51.293
Commander Ryymax was
asking where you were.

32:51.428 --> 32:54.295
You'd better go out there
or he'll get suspicious.

32:54.431 --> 32:55.216
Does he have to?

32:55.349 --> 32:58.341
You say nothing.

32:58.477 --> 33:00.559
You understand me?

33:14.535 --> 33:16.150
He's not going to...?

33:19.165 --> 33:26.412
Look, there's a very good chance
I'm going to get captured
here, right?

33:26.547 --> 33:32.167
Well, before I am | at least
need to let my ship know
about this.

33:32.303 --> 33:35.090
But it's only onlux. Just onlux.

33:35.222 --> 33:36.758
It is what they need.

33:36.891 --> 33:38.347
(sighs)

33:38.475 --> 33:41.387
Here, Aeryn! Here!

33:42.521 --> 33:44.477
What's wrong?

33:44.607 --> 33:46.188
We need to take off immediately.

33:46.317 --> 33:49.855
The ship is collapsing and
Pilot is refusing to follow
my commands.

33:49.987 --> 33:51.102
Zhaan.

33:51.238 --> 33:55.151
We've run out of time. We need
to remove the device right now.

33:55.284 --> 33:57.024
If you do it, you do it
without me.

33:57.161 --> 33:59.652
You're the only one small
enough. Come on.

33:59.788 --> 34:01.949
(growling)

34:07.755 --> 34:10.246
Wait outside.

34:10.382 --> 34:11.758
Please.

34:12.301 --> 34:13.882
Let me.

34:16.347 --> 34:21.262
Your greatest fear will come
to pass, Hynerian.

34:21.393 --> 34:24.851
Someday you will die at the
hands of a Peacekeeper.

34:30.110 --> 34:32.271
As though you'll get the chance

34:32.404 --> 34:34.565
before we're all crushed

34:34.698 --> 34:37.030
or I kill the ship myself.

34:39.787 --> 34:41.493
You're afraid.

34:41.622 --> 34:44.329
You're afraid this great ship
will die.

34:46.085 --> 34:48.076
ldon't know what I'm doing.

34:48.212 --> 34:51.170
I've always had others
to do for me.

34:51.715 --> 34:54.252
Even in prison, I...

34:55.719 --> 34:58.381
I don't even know how
to hold a tool.

34:59.515 --> 35:03.303
There is great pain in this for
all of us, isn't there?

35:04.270 --> 35:05.259
Come.

35:05.396 --> 35:08.012
We'll face the pain together.

35:21.078 --> 35:22.864
Will he do it?

35:24.373 --> 35:26.329
I believe so.

35:26.458 --> 35:28.289
l have something that'll
heal that.

35:28.419 --> 35:29.124
Later.

35:29.253 --> 35:30.868
We deal with the ship first.

35:31.005 --> 35:31.869
Of course.

35:32.006 --> 35:33.621
What's taking him so long?

35:33.757 --> 35:35.293
Give him a moment.

35:35.426 --> 35:38.759
It's a big responsibility riding
on those not-so-large shoulders.

35:38.887 --> 35:42.220
Are you truly able to take
away the ship's pain?

35:42.349 --> 35:44.010
This entire ship?

35:44.768 --> 35:46.929
| only share the pain.

35:47.062 --> 35:50.725
I'm afraid that Moya still
bears the larger portion.

35:50.858 --> 35:52.769
I don't know how she's doing it.

35:52.901 --> 35:55.153
What about how you're doing it?

35:57.740 --> 35:58.820
Are you laughing at me?

35:58.949 --> 36:03.192
Ah, no, no my dear.
I'm not laughing.

36:03.329 --> 36:07.072
You just seemed very briefly
to be concerned for me.

36:07.207 --> 36:11.792
I'm concerned only that you're
able to complete your
undertaking to share Moya's pain.

36:11.920 --> 36:13.876
Yes, of course.

36:19.053 --> 36:22.216
We're going to need
biological containment.

36:22.348 --> 36:24.589
No, we haven't trapped
anything yet

36:24.725 --> 36:27.637
but I want us to be 100%
ready when we do.

36:28.479 --> 36:30.891
Yes, I said when.

36:32.191 --> 36:34.898
A "wormhole"?

36:35.027 --> 36:37.484
That's what we call it.

36:37.613 --> 36:39.569
Well, I know the phenomenon
you're talking about.

36:39.698 --> 36:41.814
We call it a "ribbonhole."

36:41.950 --> 36:44.908
Although, theoretically,
they don't really exist.

36:45.037 --> 36:48.074
Well, they didn't exist for
me, either till I got
sucked down one.

36:48.207 --> 36:51.199
So, you don't even know
where your home is?

36:51.335 --> 36:53.121
Crichton:
l have no idea.

36:53.253 --> 36:55.869
You didn't really chose
me, did you?

36:57.633 --> 36:59.123
No.

36:59.259 --> 37:03.047
Okay, listen, I've routed this
through the main dishes outside.

37:03.180 --> 37:06.843
It's as strong as I can get it
and it's very broadband.

37:08.060 --> 37:11.393
( static crackling )

37:12.106 --> 37:14.188
Aeryn, D'argo, are you there?

37:14.316 --> 37:16.181
( static continues )

37:16.318 --> 37:18.730
Can you guys read me, Aeryn?

37:20.489 --> 37:22.070
Are you out there, D'argo?

37:22.199 --> 37:23.735
Crichton...

37:23.867 --> 37:26.244
Crichton, is that you?

37:26.370 --> 37:28.235
How is your signal
getting through?

37:28.372 --> 37:32.365
Our comms will not
penetrate the mud.

37:32.501 --> 37:34.833
Moya is bearing up...

37:34.962 --> 37:37.920
Crichton: Is this guy more
what you were expecting?

37:55.774 --> 37:57.150
Sir, you've got to come, quick!

37:57.276 --> 38:01.144
Now, sir!

38:01.280 --> 38:02.190
Pilot:
Crichton are you...

38:02.322 --> 38:03.937
-Mom!
-Fostro!

38:04.074 --> 38:05.985
Another one!
They've captured another one!

38:06.118 --> 38:07.073
Man:
Restrain him!

38:07.202 --> 38:10.410
(shouting and grunting)

38:43.947 --> 38:45.198
(moaning)

38:45.324 --> 38:50.364
Rygel: Sorry, Moya, but I
have to out fast.

38:50.496 --> 38:56.241
(groaning)

39:14.269 --> 39:16.055
Fostro.

39:20.150 --> 39:21.765
Wrong move.

39:26.865 --> 39:29.242
We found him less than a
half a milon from here.

39:29.368 --> 39:30.528
Look at him.

39:30.661 --> 39:32.401
He's phenomenal.

39:32.538 --> 39:35.200
You and Fostro are going to
have to get out of the
area immediately.

39:35.332 --> 39:38.244
It's no longer safe
for you here.

39:43.715 --> 39:44.704
Is he all right?

39:44.841 --> 39:46.706
What kind of ship are you?

39:46.843 --> 39:50.176
That thing on the computer in
there and now this one trying
to pull down my barn?

39:50.305 --> 39:53.172
You said you were a scientist
a science ship.

39:53.308 --> 39:55.299
I am a scientist.

39:55.435 --> 39:58.302
My ship is...

39:58.438 --> 40:01.145
it's a prison transport.

40:01.275 --> 40:03.140
Escaped prisoners.

40:03.277 --> 40:04.858
Prisoners?

40:04.987 --> 40:06.102
Yeah.

40:06.238 --> 40:07.273
You...?

40:07.406 --> 40:11.240
No, it's a... galactic
misunderstanding.

40:16.123 --> 40:17.283
Here.

40:17.416 --> 40:20.408
Take your precious onlux
and get out of my house.

40:20.544 --> 40:21.579
Go now!

40:21.712 --> 40:23.077
Not without my friend.

40:23.213 --> 40:25.249
Oh, it's too late for him.

40:25.382 --> 40:29.796
He's going to be laid open on an
autopsy table by dawn tomorrow.

40:29.928 --> 40:34.012
That's what I've been trying
to protect you from.

40:35.267 --> 40:37.428
I won't go without him.

40:40.272 --> 40:43.355
"Only if you want to go."

40:47.446 --> 40:50.358
(rumbling)

40:50.490 --> 40:53.072
(groaning)

40:55.203 --> 40:57.239
Get me back. Get me back.

40:57.372 --> 40:59.237
(groaning)

40:59.374 --> 41:00.989
Rygel, get it done in there.

41:01.126 --> 41:04.038
Your encouragement is
much appreciated.

41:04.171 --> 41:06.207
(groaning)

41:06.340 --> 41:07.625
Itjust started coming up.

41:07.758 --> 41:10.841
I was recalibrating, and all
of a sudden it started...

41:10.969 --> 41:13.836
Wait till you see it, Ryymax.
It is unbelievable.

41:13.972 --> 41:15.633
Watch. Watch this.

41:18.644 --> 41:19.554
Crichton?

41:19.686 --> 41:21.802
Crichton, is that you?

41:21.938 --> 41:23.849
How is your signal
getting through?

41:23.982 --> 41:27.440
Our comms will not
penetrate the mud.

41:29.488 --> 41:31.194
Moya is bearing up.

41:31.323 --> 41:37.159
Pa'u Zhaan is helping all she
can but we need the clorium.

41:38.997 --> 41:42.205
Do you have a fix on the
origin of this signal?

42:31.591 --> 42:33.673
Zeta team, move out.

42:42.978 --> 42:44.718
Stay back, boy.

43:03.790 --> 43:05.826
You took your time.

43:07.335 --> 43:10.293
Hey, kid. Want to shake
his hand?

43:10.422 --> 43:12.504
Go ahead. He doesn't bite.

43:24.519 --> 43:26.350
See?

43:31.026 --> 43:35.065
(grunting)

43:39.743 --> 43:42.234
(gasping)

43:50.086 --> 43:53.214
Here. This is yours.

43:53.340 --> 43:56.207
Ryymax and his men are off
searching Akon's Field.

43:56.343 --> 43:59.176
It's in the opposite direction
of the swamp.

43:59.304 --> 44:01.636
I wish there was more
I could do.

44:01.765 --> 44:06.179
You've altered the perceptions
and beliefs of an entire planet.

44:06.311 --> 44:08.893
Yeah. I guess that's enough for
one day.

44:09.022 --> 44:10.853
D'Argo:
Crichton, we must go.

44:10.982 --> 44:14.065
It will be dark soon.
We may not find our way back.

44:14.194 --> 44:17.027
Keep watching the skies.

44:17.155 --> 44:19.271
That's how you people
say good-bye?

44:19.407 --> 44:22.695
What? Your people don't do that?

44:26.373 --> 44:27.328
Fostro:
Good-bye...

44:27.457 --> 44:30.039
D'argo.

44:37.300 --> 44:40.212
You are the luckiest
nine-year-old around.

44:40.345 --> 44:47.092
Someday you are going to have a
very singular story to tell.

44:47.227 --> 44:52.392
You can't tell it for a long
time, of course, but someday.

44:53.942 --> 44:55.227
Oh, blast.

44:55.360 --> 44:56.941
Aeryn:
Rygel!

44:57.946 --> 45:00.153
Pilot!

45:00.824 --> 45:03.406
Pierce. Pierce. Pierce.

45:05.328 --> 45:06.613
Crichton:
Aeryn!

45:06.746 --> 45:08.122
Crichton, where are you?!

45:08.248 --> 45:10.159
We're back! D'argo and
I are back!

45:10.292 --> 45:12.374
Pilot, prepare for liftoff!

45:13.587 --> 45:14.372
I can't.

45:14.504 --> 45:15.835
What do you mean you can't?!

45:15.964 --> 45:18.250
The pain along the neural
nexus is too great.

45:18.383 --> 45:20.715
I can't get control of Moya's
propulsion systems.

45:20.844 --> 45:22.254
Crichton:
Just hold on. We're coming down.

45:22.387 --> 45:24.298
Hurry, will you?!

45:26.391 --> 45:28.848
(grunting and groaning)

45:28.977 --> 45:31.218
( screaming )

45:34.357 --> 45:35.938
Hurry!

45:45.410 --> 45:49.278
(Moya moaning)

45:49.414 --> 45:50.779
It's done.

45:50.916 --> 45:52.622
It's done.

45:52.751 --> 45:56.164
Pilot:
The beacon is no longer
broadcasting.

45:56.296 --> 45:58.002
I did it.

45:58.131 --> 45:59.291
I did it.

45:59.424 --> 46:01.085
I did it!

46:01.217 --> 46:02.878
Yo RygeI--

46:03.011 --> 46:07.254
start spreading this around,
everywhere you can.

46:09.517 --> 46:12.429
(warbling)

46:15.315 --> 46:16.395
Pilot:
Your attention.

46:16.524 --> 46:18.264
Prepare to liftoff.

46:18.401 --> 46:22.394
As Moya has never done this
before I don't know
what to expect.

46:23.323 --> 46:25.405
Oh.

46:27.035 --> 46:29.196
Hmm.

46:29.329 --> 46:31.661
Hmm...

46:31.790 --> 46:33.200
Hmm.

46:33.333 --> 46:36.245
(slurping)

46:56.523 --> 46:58.104
Zhaan...

46:58.858 --> 47:01.110
Zhaan.

47:01.236 --> 47:03.352
It's done.

47:03.822 --> 47:05.028
(moaning)

47:05.156 --> 47:07.021
Ouch.

47:10.578 --> 47:12.910
Crichton:
Aeryn, let's go.

47:17.252 --> 47:20.710
(sighing and gasping)

47:21.715 --> 47:28.132
Oh, oh. Oh, never, ever again.

47:49.367 --> 47:50.823
We're free!

47:50.952 --> 47:52.362
We're going to make it.

48:44.297 --> 48:47.334
Don't tell me you're going
to miss that rock.

48:49.552 --> 48:52.043
No, not that rock.
