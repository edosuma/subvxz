WEBVTT

00:00.300 --> 00:03.180
Although the council may
have its political differences,

00:03.180 --> 00:06.180
I know that we are united
in our contrition...

00:07.180 --> 00:08.540
Conviction.

00:11.060 --> 00:14.420
..that in order to tackle
the issues laid out in the...

00:15.980 --> 00:19.420
Beverage sounds a bit pompous.
Can't I just say drink?

00:19.420 --> 00:22.700
You could, if you weren't
talking about the economist

00:22.700 --> 00:25.940
William Beveridge and the report
which inspired the welfare state.

00:28.820 --> 00:30.820
So what do you think?
Do I look the part?

00:30.820 --> 00:32.060
It looked better on Mummy.

00:33.980 --> 00:36.340
Have you finished your chores?

00:36.340 --> 00:38.060
Found this under your bed.

00:42.020 --> 00:44.660
Silly me. I've been looking
everywhere for that.

00:47.300 --> 00:49.220
You only ever wear pearls.

00:49.220 --> 00:52.300
It's a leaving present. For Matilda.

00:54.740 --> 00:56.740
She handed in her notice last week.

00:56.740 --> 00:58.020
You never said.

00:58.020 --> 01:00.020
Why would I? It's got
nothing to do with you.

01:00.020 --> 01:02.300
She's been working for you
for six years.

01:02.300 --> 01:05.700
And hands in her notice right after
taking a fortnight's holiday.

01:05.700 --> 01:08.020
What was it doing under our bed?

01:08.020 --> 01:10.860
Must have fallen out of my pocket.

01:10.860 --> 01:12.460
Why isn't it in a box?

01:16.580 --> 01:18.820
Will you stop asking questions?

01:20.000 --> 01:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:54.660 --> 02:01.020
No, no, not south-facing,
the goldfish will overheat.

02:01.020 --> 02:03.420
Well, don't just stand there.

02:03.420 --> 02:06.220
Have you forgotten the mayor
will be gracing us

02:06.220 --> 02:09.340
with his presence
in less than an hour?

02:09.340 --> 02:13.220
How can we forget when you
remind us every five minute?

02:13.220 --> 02:16.820
I hope that humbug in your mouth
is not one you've counted already.

02:16.820 --> 02:18.700
What do you take me for?

02:20.180 --> 02:22.500
What have we got here?

02:22.500 --> 02:27.420
Faworki. Polish pastry.
We call it angel hair.

02:27.420 --> 02:30.260
Tentacles of Leviathan, more like.

02:30.260 --> 02:35.300
You see, that's what you get when
you support exotic causes, Father.

02:35.300 --> 02:38.140
Polish primary school, indeed!

02:40.780 --> 02:43.500
Father, do you know this mayor?

02:43.500 --> 02:47.500
No, but his wife's quite charming.

02:47.500 --> 02:51.020
Does a lot for charity. Oh.
Exceptionally clever woman.

02:51.020 --> 02:53.700
When he will start building school?

02:53.700 --> 02:56.620
We're only at the fundraising stage.

02:56.620 --> 02:59.220
But the men from his office
measured the whole camp.

03:01.980 --> 03:03.700
So? How many?

03:07.260 --> 03:08.940
How many humbugs in the jar?

03:16.980 --> 03:18.620
Morning, Matilda.

03:18.620 --> 03:20.100
Mr Mayor.

03:21.420 --> 03:23.900
You're fired, by the way.
As of tomorrow.

03:37.140 --> 03:40.500
Why she couldn't just dress up as
a princess like other girls her age.

03:40.500 --> 03:43.220
You know I can't award you
first prize.

03:43.220 --> 03:45.260
I have to give it to an orphan,

03:45.260 --> 03:48.460
or some other unfortunate.
Will you make enquiries?

03:50.420 --> 03:51.780
How was your holiday?

03:52.860 --> 03:57.100
Yes, good, thank you, yes.

03:57.100 --> 03:58.740
Margate. Lovely.

04:00.980 --> 04:02.460
Aren't you going to open it?

04:13.700 --> 04:16.940
A token of my appreciation
for all your hard work.

04:21.019 --> 04:24.940
I don't think she likes it.
I can't say I blame her.

04:24.940 --> 04:26.500
It's very cheap and tacky.

04:32.580 --> 04:34.820
Really? And again?

04:34.820 --> 04:37.500
Very beautiful dress, Lady Felicia.

04:37.500 --> 04:39.180
Oh, would you mind?

04:44.220 --> 04:45.700
Very expensive.

04:51.020 --> 04:52.140
Thank you so much.

04:54.500 --> 04:57.260
Your estate borders
the Polish camp, doesn't it?

04:57.260 --> 05:00.100
Quite possibly. Our estate's
rather sprawling. Why do you ask?

05:00.100 --> 05:02.820
Father. Ah. Edwin, isn't it?

05:05.140 --> 05:08.380
That's a waste of money.
There'll be no school.

05:09.740 --> 05:13.180
So what time's the mayor arriving?
Will he be giving a speech?

05:13.180 --> 05:17.660
May I remind you, today is a
family day, not a political rally.

05:17.660 --> 05:19.740
Father, we should be
at the gates by now.

05:19.740 --> 05:21.340
The mayor will be here any minute.

05:21.340 --> 05:24.820
Oh, and I thought you might like
to present this to his lady wife.

05:24.820 --> 05:28.380
I made it myself. Quite exquisite.

05:28.380 --> 05:30.900
Even if the apostrophe's
in the wrong place.

05:34.700 --> 05:37.500
What do you mean,
there'll be no school?

05:37.500 --> 05:38.780
Ask the mayor.

05:42.260 --> 05:44.020
I don't know why you bother
with make-up.

05:46.700 --> 05:48.980
You can't improve on perfection.

05:55.420 --> 05:58.700
Don't even think about coming
to me for a reference.

05:58.700 --> 06:00.380
What?

06:01.820 --> 06:05.180
Lord knows, you'll never be pretty,
Kathleen, but if you smile

06:05.180 --> 06:08.540
from time to time, you might look
less like the spawn of Satan.

06:14.540 --> 06:16.660
Your father's very stressed
at the moment.

06:16.660 --> 06:18.740
He doesn't know what he's saying.
He doesn't...

06:43.100 --> 06:45.020
Look at that!

06:45.020 --> 06:47.380
Do you mind? Certainly, Father.

06:48.620 --> 06:50.900
It's not a real rabbit.

07:00.620 --> 07:02.620
Can you saw people in half?

07:02.620 --> 07:04.460
Only little girls.

07:08.540 --> 07:09.980
For goodness' sake!

07:11.300 --> 07:14.180
What on earth did you say
to that poor girl?

07:14.180 --> 07:16.740
Nothing. It was the magician.

07:19.540 --> 07:22.140
Father, how much Pimm's
have you had?

07:22.140 --> 07:25.420
Come along, Father,
they'll be here by now!

07:26.980 --> 07:28.500
Father Brown!

07:33.140 --> 07:36.180
Now, don't forget, it's imperative
we make a good impression.

07:38.340 --> 07:41.740
Eleanor, good morning. Father Brown.
Pleased to meet you.

07:41.740 --> 07:44.780
Mr Mayor, on behalf
of the parish of St Mary,

07:44.780 --> 07:48.460
may I say how delighted we are
that you've chosen this

07:48.460 --> 07:52.620
special occasion to deliver
your inaugural mayoral speech.

07:52.620 --> 07:56.020
And, of course, we are extremely
grateful for your help

07:56.020 --> 08:00.140
in our fundraising. Remind me, what
are the proceeds going towards?

08:00.140 --> 08:02.860
The primary school...

08:02.860 --> 08:05.100
in a Polish resettlement camp.

08:05.100 --> 08:07.580
I'm sure you're familiar
with the community.

08:07.580 --> 08:10.660
Not really, no. No?

08:10.660 --> 08:13.660
No, well, why would you be?

08:15.020 --> 08:18.620
Kathleen, darling,
come and meet the vicar.

08:18.620 --> 08:19.940
Priest.

08:19.940 --> 08:21.900
No matter. Still in one piece.

08:21.900 --> 08:23.980
I don't believe in God.

08:23.980 --> 08:27.140
I do apologise.
She's a spirited little madam.

08:28.460 --> 08:29.580
Takes after her mother.

08:30.780 --> 08:34.940
An independent thinker
with a questioning mind -

08:34.940 --> 08:37.419
qualities I value highly.

08:37.419 --> 08:40.659
In a man, perhaps.
Rather unbecoming in a lady, however.

08:42.220 --> 08:45.220
Oh. Well, follow me, please.

08:45.220 --> 08:49.020
Matilda, haven't seen you in Mass,
lately. Are you feeling...?

08:49.020 --> 08:51.020
Better, yes. Thank you.

08:53.260 --> 08:55.020
Really go for it.

09:01.340 --> 09:05.300
Roll up, roll up!
Goldfish, win your goldfish.

09:29.060 --> 09:33.180
Fetch some help. Please!

09:33.180 --> 09:34.500
Oh!

09:34.500 --> 09:37.140
OK, but it'll cost you.

09:43.020 --> 09:45.940
You do know, most women would
kill to be in your shoes.

09:45.940 --> 09:47.780
You must be terribly proud.

09:47.780 --> 09:49.980
I hope he gets
everything he deserves.

09:52.260 --> 09:56.620
An award-winning strawberry scone?
I don't mind if I do.

10:04.940 --> 10:07.380
If you permit the observation,

10:07.380 --> 10:10.020
you don't seem quite yourself today,
Eleanor.

10:10.020 --> 10:12.620
I haven't been myself
for quite some time.

10:12.620 --> 10:15.100
But trust me,
all that's about to change.

10:15.100 --> 10:19.580
Father, Father!
Magic man take funny turn.

10:19.580 --> 10:21.900
I leave him in ambulance tent
but someone need to look.

10:21.900 --> 10:24.340
Magic man? Oh, a magician.

10:25.620 --> 10:27.020
Did you book a magician?

10:28.580 --> 10:31.460
Oh, whoever it is, I'll see to them.

10:31.460 --> 10:34.740
Now, be sure and tell the mayor
everything is ready for his speech.

10:37.340 --> 10:38.580
Father Brown.

10:39.620 --> 10:43.380
Inspector. You might want to keep
a close eye on your coffers.

10:43.380 --> 10:46.860
I'm afraid we've had reports
of a pickpocket on the loose.

10:46.860 --> 10:49.540
I've asked around.
The boy dressed as a robot

10:49.540 --> 10:51.340
recently lost his mother to polio.

10:51.340 --> 10:55.260
Will you stop gabbling? I cannot
bear the sound of your voice.

11:01.700 --> 11:03.700
Looking forward to
your father's big moment?

11:04.980 --> 11:09.780
My mother's, more like.
She's the one who should be mayor.

11:09.780 --> 11:11.420
It's not fair.

11:11.420 --> 11:15.020
Matilda was in the Wrens
before she became a secretary.

11:15.020 --> 11:16.900
Why can't married women
have careers?

11:18.540 --> 11:21.100
Kathleen, if you ever need
a friend... I don't.

11:21.100 --> 11:25.420
But if you did, my door
is always open.

11:25.420 --> 11:29.020
Ahem. Good morning.

11:30.580 --> 11:32.220
Sit up straight, darling.

11:33.820 --> 11:35.500
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

11:36.620 --> 11:40.660
Firstly, may I say what a great
pleasure it is to be here

11:40.660 --> 11:43.620
on such a pleasurable occasion.

11:59.300 --> 12:02.540
And on behalf of...

12:02.540 --> 12:03.860
Kathleen?

12:03.860 --> 12:07.900
..collectively, may I thank Mr Brown

12:07.900 --> 12:12.180
and his team of church...people...

12:13.660 --> 12:17.860
..without which, today would
have been implausible.

12:20.860 --> 12:22.500
My English is better than his, no?

12:23.660 --> 12:27.660
With your hope, we help to build

12:27.660 --> 12:31.580
a school for primary children

12:31.580 --> 12:35.940
in Poland, a project
which I feel, personally,

12:35.940 --> 12:38.540
extremely heartfelt about. Hypocrite!

12:40.260 --> 12:44.860
Mr Mayor, I have it on good
authority that you're

12:44.860 --> 12:49.020
conspiring with our local MP
to profit from the sale

12:49.020 --> 12:52.300
of a prime piece of property
in Kembleford.

12:52.300 --> 12:55.860
I know this man.
He courted my Polish friend.

12:55.860 --> 12:59.100
Isn't it true that you
recently purchased a large area

12:59.100 --> 13:02.620
of agricultural land
through a private company

13:02.620 --> 13:05.780
registered in your wife's
maiden name?

13:05.780 --> 13:07.420
I don't know
what he's talking about.

13:07.420 --> 13:12.940
And isn't it a coincidence that the
same area of land has been earmarked

13:12.940 --> 13:17.500
by central government to build
a new coal-fired power station,

13:17.500 --> 13:22.420
information detailed in a
confidential memo circulated within

13:22.420 --> 13:24.940
the Ministry of Fuel and Power,

13:24.940 --> 13:28.860
which our local MP leaked to you?

13:28.860 --> 13:32.500
Ladies and gentlemen, please
don't listen to this imbecile.

13:32.500 --> 13:36.140
It goes without saying
that such a development would

13:36.140 --> 13:40.180
exponentially increase the value
of the land in question.

13:40.180 --> 13:44.420
Presumably, you and Mr Carlisle plan
to divide the spoils between you?

13:44.420 --> 13:47.100
Where could they possibly build
a power station in Kembleford?

13:47.100 --> 13:52.220
I am talking, of course,
about the Polish resettlement camp!

13:52.220 --> 13:56.220
It's just sour grapes because
I was elected instead of him!

13:59.660 --> 14:01.340
It's hardly surprising.

14:01.340 --> 14:03.740
Who wants a mayor
who grew up on a pig farm?

14:05.420 --> 14:07.900
Only pigs want pigs
to represent them!

14:07.900 --> 14:10.260
I've heard enough. You, sir!

14:10.260 --> 14:12.260
Are you a pig, sir? Oink, oink!

14:13.580 --> 14:17.900
Why don't you ask him why he
withdrew from the elections, eh?

14:17.900 --> 14:20.660
Don't buy a pig in a poke.

14:20.660 --> 14:23.500
He's the one with the dirty secret.

14:23.500 --> 14:26.500
He's the one peddling porky pies.

14:26.500 --> 14:29.020
If you really want the truth,
I'll give you the truth!

14:41.540 --> 14:47.260
Ego te absolvo ab omnibus
censuris, et peccatis...

14:51.820 --> 14:54.420
We saw everyone leaving.
What's happened?

14:56.580 --> 14:58.140
Is he dead?

14:58.140 --> 14:59.540
I'm terribly sorry.

14:59.540 --> 15:01.340
Is it true, what he say?

15:01.340 --> 15:03.980
Is government planning
to throw us out from our homes?

15:03.980 --> 15:07.460
Susie, please. A man is dead.

15:07.460 --> 15:10.140
A husband and a father.
Now is not the time.

15:12.820 --> 15:15.060
Mummy?

15:15.060 --> 15:17.300
I'm thirsty. Are you thirsty?

15:18.380 --> 15:19.820
Let's get something to drink.

15:29.420 --> 15:31.300
William.

15:36.220 --> 15:37.660
He looks so peaceful.

15:39.940 --> 15:41.980
Please accept my condolences.

15:41.980 --> 15:43.860
I'll inform the relevant
authorities.

15:46.900 --> 15:48.940
He's very young to have had
a heart attack.

15:48.940 --> 15:53.660
He had a heart condition. That's
why he didn't serve in the war.

15:57.340 --> 15:59.700
Do you think it was the shock
of that man's accusations?

16:01.420 --> 16:02.580
Father?

16:15.420 --> 16:17.260
Mrs McCarthy?
Can I help you with...?

16:17.260 --> 16:20.980
Bridget. My name is Bridget.

16:24.860 --> 16:27.460
I don't understand
why she act crazy.

16:27.460 --> 16:29.340
She not the one making homeless!

16:30.740 --> 16:33.940
What happens to land when he dead?
If wife don't sell, maybe...

16:33.940 --> 16:36.500
No. I'm afraid it doesn't
quite work like that.

16:36.500 --> 16:38.500
If the government
want to build on the land,

16:38.500 --> 16:40.980
all they need do is issue
a compulsory purchase order.

16:47.060 --> 16:52.020
Father, I'm worried
about Mrs McCarthy.

16:52.020 --> 16:53.260
She's not herself.

16:55.860 --> 17:00.140
Probably just shock.
Strong cup of tea, plenty of sugar.

17:00.140 --> 17:02.460
It's not the first time
she's seen a dead body.

17:02.460 --> 17:06.099
Usually, she's planning the wake
while he's still warm.

17:06.099 --> 17:08.339
How long's she been like this?

17:08.339 --> 17:10.940
Since she see magic man
in the ambulance tent.

17:17.260 --> 17:20.900
A stranger in town and not much
of a magician, by all accounts.

17:22.339 --> 17:25.180
Why are you really here?
May I have a word?

17:25.180 --> 17:29.060
I have a few questions for
this gentleman, myself, first.

17:29.060 --> 17:33.420
Summer fete? The great and the good
in their Sunday best?

17:33.420 --> 17:37.100
Then the mayor has a heart attack
and everyone's distracted.

17:37.100 --> 17:39.820
Rich pickings, isn't that right?

17:39.820 --> 17:41.740
Father Brown!

17:41.740 --> 17:43.260
I'm a bit busy at the moment.

17:46.660 --> 17:48.220
Go on. Get out of here.

17:50.100 --> 17:53.820
And a very good day to you,
Sergeant. Inspector.

17:57.740 --> 17:59.420
It's the public address system.

17:59.420 --> 18:01.220
I know exactly what it is,
Inspector.

18:03.860 --> 18:06.860
The mayor had a burn mark on
his hand and then there was that

18:06.860 --> 18:08.460
strange crackling noise.

18:10.220 --> 18:14.580
What, you think he was electrocuted?
Suppose the system could be faulty.

18:14.580 --> 18:17.260
It's been tampered with.
The back's been unscrewed.

18:18.980 --> 18:20.620
Fresh solder.

18:23.220 --> 18:25.620
This has been connected
to the mains. Father?

18:25.620 --> 18:27.420
I think you better come, quickly.

18:35.060 --> 18:37.580
I don't know what's come over her.

18:37.580 --> 18:41.540
Hardly the behaviour of a grieving
widow. Or a guilty conscience.

18:41.540 --> 18:43.820
Mrs Mayor, I wonder
if there's somewhere

18:43.820 --> 18:46.060
we could have a quiet word?

18:46.060 --> 18:48.980
I suddenly feel a little sick.

18:48.980 --> 18:51.140
You were married to the man
for 12 years.

18:51.140 --> 18:52.780
Do you not feel anything at all?

18:52.780 --> 18:55.660
Matilda, is there someone who could
look after Kathleen for a while?

18:55.660 --> 18:59.060
I don't want that slut
anywhere near my daughter.

18:59.060 --> 19:01.140
Fine. She's not MY child.

19:02.340 --> 19:05.500
Mummy, why does a policeman
want to talk to you?

19:05.500 --> 19:07.260
I'm sure it's nothing serious.

19:07.260 --> 19:10.620
If you could just come with me,
please. I want to stay with my mum!

19:10.620 --> 19:11.660
My bag.

19:13.580 --> 19:15.580
I'll be back before
you know it, darling.

19:30.020 --> 19:32.580
Hay fever. Makes me terribly hungry.

19:36.140 --> 19:37.860
I just met the magician.

19:42.060 --> 19:45.100
We really should get
some new chairs.

19:45.100 --> 19:47.380
These are riddled with woodworm.

19:47.380 --> 19:50.340
I thought your husband
died in the trenches.

19:53.260 --> 19:57.300
When he didn't come home,
he was presumed missing in action.

19:58.940 --> 20:02.740
Mrs McCarthy, can I just...?
This is nothing to do with you!

20:02.740 --> 20:04.980
Would you please
just leave me alone?

20:25.620 --> 20:29.660
Mrs Mayor, how would you describe
your relationship with your husband?

20:29.660 --> 20:32.820
Susie has arranged for neighbours
to look after Kathleen

20:32.820 --> 20:34.580
until you get home. Thank you.

20:34.580 --> 20:36.940
Mrs Mayor?

20:36.940 --> 20:39.460
Would you like to hear
my husband's favourite joke?

20:39.460 --> 20:43.180
I'd prefer it
if you just answered... Please.

20:43.180 --> 20:46.780
A young boy and his father
go out for a drive one day.

20:46.780 --> 20:50.300
There's an accident,
the car goes off a cliff.

20:50.300 --> 20:51.780
The boy's rushed to hospital

20:51.780 --> 20:55.180
where the surgeon almost
collapses from shock,

20:55.180 --> 20:58.460
says, "That's my son
on the operating table."

21:01.340 --> 21:05.020
That's not funny.
It doesn't even make sense.

21:06.580 --> 21:08.140
The surgeon is a woman.

21:11.820 --> 21:14.100
Your husband felt threatened by you?

21:14.100 --> 21:16.140
With good reason.

21:16.140 --> 21:17.540
Intellectually.

21:18.980 --> 21:21.940
I got him elected.

21:21.940 --> 21:24.140
We met at school.

21:24.140 --> 21:28.820
He was tongue-tied, awkward,
he struggled academically.

21:29.900 --> 21:34.940
I thought he was sweet, so
I coached him through his exams,

21:34.940 --> 21:39.060
through university.
I wrote all his speeches.

21:39.060 --> 21:43.980
I thought, together,
we might make a difference.

21:45.300 --> 21:47.540
And then you found out
he was having an affair.

21:49.620 --> 21:51.820
Where did you find this?

21:51.820 --> 21:53.380
With his secretary.

21:55.260 --> 21:56.900
So you wanted to punish him?

21:56.900 --> 21:59.660
It opened my eyes.

21:59.660 --> 22:03.980
He didn't care about me.
He didn't care about Kathleen.

22:03.980 --> 22:07.100
All that was ever going to matter
to him was lining his own pockets

22:07.100 --> 22:09.300
and putting us back in our place.

22:09.300 --> 22:13.540
And while I was foolish enough
to throw my life away,

22:13.540 --> 22:16.020
Kathleen still has a bright future
ahead of her.

22:16.020 --> 22:19.500
Just as long as we were
free of him.

22:20.540 --> 22:21.660
I see.

22:23.500 --> 22:26.340
Eleanor Knight, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of murder.

22:28.340 --> 22:29.620
Murder?

22:29.620 --> 22:32.300
You're not obliged to say anything
unless you wish to do so.

22:32.300 --> 22:34.220
Whatever you do say
will be put in writing

22:34.220 --> 22:35.740
and may be given in evidence.

22:35.740 --> 22:39.260
I was planning to leave him,
not to kill him!

22:45.500 --> 22:49.140
I'm afraid I've taken
a terrible liberty.

22:49.140 --> 22:50.860
I know you said you didn't care,

22:50.860 --> 22:53.620
but one mustn't let fear
stand in the way of happiness.

22:56.340 --> 23:00.260
Bridget Maguire,
a chuisle mo chroi.

23:09.020 --> 23:13.380
I'm going home now.
It has been a dreadful day.

23:14.660 --> 23:19.740
All I want is a chance to explain.
Let me call on you this afternoon.

23:21.380 --> 23:24.340
And then will you leave me alone?

23:24.340 --> 23:27.420
I'll never bother you again,
if that's what you want.

23:29.060 --> 23:30.540
Three o'clock?

23:37.940 --> 23:39.180
Your ladyship.

23:41.820 --> 23:44.340
Is that really necessary?

23:44.340 --> 23:47.300
It's for your own protection
while I call for a car

23:47.300 --> 23:48.740
to take her back to the station.

23:50.140 --> 23:53.020
I didn't do it.
You have to believe me!

23:53.020 --> 23:56.020
Did you leak the details about
the power station to Edwin Bloom?

23:56.020 --> 24:00.340
I thought if his corruption
was exposed then we would have

24:00.340 --> 24:03.060
an excuse to leave
with our heads held high.

24:03.060 --> 24:05.700
Why? Do you think it was him?

24:05.700 --> 24:09.020
Just before he died, the mayor
said he had a secret.

24:09.020 --> 24:13.100
Do you know what
he was talking about? No.

24:13.100 --> 24:15.620
Do you know where
I might find Bloom now?

24:15.620 --> 24:19.020
We arranged to meet at three o'clock
this afternoon. Where?

24:19.020 --> 24:21.580
He was going to introduce me
to a journalist.

24:21.580 --> 24:23.980
He wrote the address down on a card.
It's in my bag.

24:35.380 --> 24:38.660
It's not mine.
The murderer must have planted it.

24:38.660 --> 24:41.340
Nice try, but I've
heard it all before.

24:41.340 --> 24:45.180
What if they're after
the whole family? Kathleen?

24:45.180 --> 24:46.580
I can take it from here, Father.

24:46.580 --> 24:49.380
Could Bloom have planted it in your
bag when he gave you the card?

24:49.380 --> 24:51.780
I said, I can take it from here.

24:57.260 --> 24:58.500
Hey, hey!

24:59.740 --> 25:04.460
I just wanted to thank you
for believing in me. Oh.

25:04.460 --> 25:08.340
I realise it must have gone against
all your instincts,

25:08.340 --> 25:10.420
as a friend. My instincts?

25:10.420 --> 25:14.940
I know, I hurt her terribly,
but I was young and foolish.

25:14.940 --> 25:18.460
Didn't know which side
my bread was buttered on.

25:18.460 --> 25:21.380
You understand that, I can tell.

25:21.380 --> 25:23.580
Fine filly like you,

25:23.580 --> 25:25.740
bet you've known your fair share
of married men.

25:43.900 --> 25:46.220
I write letter
to House of Parliament.

25:46.220 --> 25:47.900
Then they have to take notice, yes?

25:49.100 --> 25:51.500
"Dear sir, Mr Winston Churchill."

25:51.500 --> 25:55.300
Edwin Bloom. You said your friend
was courting him.

25:56.300 --> 25:57.780
Yes.

25:57.780 --> 26:01.100
Do you happen to know why he
withdrew his candidacy for mayor?

26:01.100 --> 26:03.900
I think he get found out
for criminal record.

26:03.900 --> 26:05.300
A criminal record? For what?

26:07.740 --> 26:09.620
How do you spell petition?

26:09.620 --> 26:12.740
P, E, T, I, T, I, O, N.
Criminal record for what?

26:13.980 --> 26:17.780
Yibby, jibby, GB...something.

26:17.780 --> 26:19.860
Do you know what it stand for?

26:35.700 --> 26:37.220
I was just passing.

26:39.140 --> 26:41.260
The Earl gives me so many,

26:41.260 --> 26:43.500
they've been cluttering up
the house for weeks.

26:43.500 --> 26:45.860
I thought someone ought to get
some pleasure out of them.

27:00.140 --> 27:03.140
Was there something in particular
you came to see me about?

27:05.260 --> 27:07.860
I just wanted to check
you were all right, that's all.

27:09.020 --> 27:11.420
Quite all right, thank you.

27:11.420 --> 27:13.340
And to say sorry.

27:13.340 --> 27:15.540
For interfering
when I shouldn't have.

27:17.980 --> 27:20.660
Please don't settle for
anything less than you deserve.

27:21.700 --> 27:24.140
You've changed your tune.

27:24.140 --> 27:27.340
I just don't want to see you
get hurt, that's all.

27:27.340 --> 27:31.340
And since when have you given
a flying fig about my feelings?

27:31.340 --> 27:32.860
We both know you think

27:32.860 --> 27:35.220
I'm a foolish old woman with ideas
above my station.

27:35.220 --> 27:37.100
Well, now, hang on! And, of course,

27:37.100 --> 27:41.180
I think you're a stuck-up madam
with too much time on your hands,

27:41.180 --> 27:44.780
so we'll leave it at that, shall we?

27:46.860 --> 27:48.340
I'll show myself out.

28:06.420 --> 28:08.900
Usual, please, Norma.

28:08.900 --> 28:11.060
You've heard the good news then?

28:13.180 --> 28:16.660
I'm not going to pretend to like
the man just because he's dead.

28:16.660 --> 28:20.220
Do you play? From time to time.

28:29.220 --> 28:32.340
Might I ask where you went
between leaving the fete

28:32.340 --> 28:34.220
and meeting Eleanor this morning?

28:34.220 --> 28:37.140
Straight-talking man, Father.
I don't appreciate playing games.

28:38.500 --> 28:40.220
What's this all about?

28:41.780 --> 28:43.540
The mayor was murdered.

28:48.100 --> 28:52.180
And you think I'm responsible?
What do you take me for?

28:52.180 --> 28:54.540
I'm a founding member
of the Peace Pledge Union.

28:54.540 --> 28:57.300
And yet you have a conviction
for GBH.

29:01.300 --> 29:05.740
If you must know, I punched
a Nazi sympathiser after

29:05.740 --> 29:07.780
he insulted my lady friend.

29:07.780 --> 29:10.740
You might be interested to learn,
it subsequently emerged that

29:10.740 --> 29:15.820
the man in question was paid for
provoking me and pressing charges,

29:15.820 --> 29:17.900
by the mayor.

29:17.900 --> 29:20.660
Must have made you very angry.
Of course it made me angry.

29:29.340 --> 29:32.820
Mr Bloom, where did you go
after leaving the fete?

29:32.820 --> 29:34.260
It's none of your business.

29:34.260 --> 29:36.860
It is my business if someone
innocent hangs for a crime

29:36.860 --> 29:38.220
they didn't commit.

29:39.260 --> 29:42.580
I went to the phone box to call
a journalist friend of mine

29:42.580 --> 29:46.420
to arrange a meeting with Eleanor.
He'll be here shortly.

29:46.420 --> 29:50.300
You can ask him yourself if you
don't believe me. Or Kathleen.

29:50.300 --> 29:53.420
Kathleen? The mayor's daughter.

29:53.420 --> 29:56.460
I saw her hiding from the inspector
outside the church.

30:26.300 --> 30:29.420
Thank goodness you're still here.
I need to speak with Kathleen.

30:29.420 --> 30:31.020
I'm afraid that could be difficult.

30:31.020 --> 30:32.140
Why? What's happened?

30:32.140 --> 30:34.540
Your neighbour's just
reported her missing. What?

30:34.540 --> 30:37.060
She left a note saying
she was going to see a friend

30:37.060 --> 30:39.220
and hasn't been seen since.
A friend? What friend?

30:39.220 --> 30:40.500
She doesn't have any friends!

30:40.500 --> 30:43.180
I'm sure there's a perfectly
innocent explanation.

30:43.180 --> 30:44.660
Mrs Knight, calm down!

30:44.660 --> 30:47.220
There's a killer on the loose,
my daughter is in danger.

30:47.220 --> 30:48.980
Why won't anyone believe me?

30:52.940 --> 30:55.420
I never meant to hurt you.

30:55.420 --> 30:58.540
But you did. If I could go back...

30:58.540 --> 31:00.540
And you can't.

31:20.540 --> 31:24.340
So if that's all you have to say,
Frank, I think it's best that you...

31:26.540 --> 31:28.420
Absolutely not.

31:46.500 --> 31:48.900
We danced to this on our bunnymoon.

31:56.780 --> 31:58.900
18 carrots, don't you know?

32:06.060 --> 32:07.780
Oh, Francis.

32:43.460 --> 32:48.620
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

32:48.620 --> 32:51.300
It's been three months
since my last confession.

32:53.420 --> 32:55.100
I've done something terrible.

32:56.260 --> 33:00.140
It's never too late
to seek forgiveness.

33:00.140 --> 33:01.820
Even if...?

33:01.820 --> 33:03.180
Even if what?

33:06.020 --> 33:07.940
I killed my father.

33:12.500 --> 33:17.460
I've changed, Bridget.
Tell me it's not too late.

33:18.900 --> 33:20.820
Oh, Francis!

33:27.620 --> 33:30.140
So much for having changed.

33:30.140 --> 33:35.220
Aye, and I can clearly see
you're still a nag.

33:35.220 --> 33:37.340
But I'm prepared to overlook that.

33:37.340 --> 33:40.540
Why are you here? Why now?

33:40.540 --> 33:41.820
Francis!

33:43.060 --> 33:46.780
What are you not telling me?
Francis?

33:51.020 --> 33:52.860
Cirrhosis of the liver.

33:54.980 --> 33:56.820
I'm dying, Bridget.

34:05.620 --> 34:08.020
And she'd always make sure
the house was neat and tidy

34:08.020 --> 34:10.219
when he got back from work.

34:10.219 --> 34:14.260
It wasn't enough,
nothing was ever enough.

34:14.260 --> 34:15.659
Hmm.

34:17.780 --> 34:22.699
How, might I ask, exactly,
did you kill your father?

34:22.699 --> 34:26.300
I prayed he would die. Hmm.

34:26.300 --> 34:31.540
Well, wishing him dead
isn't exactly the same

34:31.540 --> 34:32.820
as actually killing him.

34:34.219 --> 34:37.340
Why were you hiding from
the police this morning?

34:42.699 --> 34:44.300
You're the pickpocket?

34:44.300 --> 34:46.659
So I'd have enough money
to get away.

34:47.780 --> 34:51.219
Doesn't look like
I'll need to anymore.

34:51.219 --> 34:52.699
Will I go to prison?

34:52.699 --> 34:55.780
I don't think we need to involve
the police at this point.

34:55.780 --> 34:59.100
I'll see the contents are returned
to their rightful owners.

34:59.100 --> 35:00.660
Where did you get that?

35:05.260 --> 35:07.460
Matilda's hair-curler.

35:07.460 --> 35:10.700
I pinched it from her bag when
she went to call an ambulance.

35:10.700 --> 35:13.220
I don't know if it's worth much.
May I see it?

35:19.780 --> 35:22.060
Probably hoping to impress my dad.

35:22.060 --> 35:24.340
I think she was
actually in love with him.

35:24.340 --> 35:26.820
Earlier, you said that Matilda
had served in the Wrens.

35:26.820 --> 35:28.700
Do you know what she did
in the Navy?

35:28.700 --> 35:33.260
Something to do with submarines
and building engine wires, maybe.

35:33.260 --> 35:35.500
She was an electrician.

35:35.500 --> 35:38.300
You can ask her yourself
if you're quick.

35:38.300 --> 35:40.140
I saw her packing her car
on my way here.

35:41.620 --> 35:44.700
Said she was going on holiday.
Again.

35:49.140 --> 35:50.740
Father?

35:52.940 --> 35:54.340
Father Brown!

35:57.060 --> 35:58.780
Blast it.

36:10.780 --> 36:12.980
Yours, I believe.

36:14.900 --> 36:17.380
Used to solder the mains supply
to the microphone jack

36:17.380 --> 36:19.100
before you electrocuted the mayor.

36:19.100 --> 36:21.260
I don't know
what you're talking about.

36:21.260 --> 36:25.100
Did he break it off? After Eleanor
found out about your affair?

36:25.100 --> 36:27.500
Is that why you planted
the screwdriver in her bag?

36:27.500 --> 36:31.340
If you don't mind, I've got a train
to catch. She'll be hung!

36:31.340 --> 36:33.020
And Kathleen will be an orphan.

36:35.140 --> 36:36.660
Get out of my way!

36:41.260 --> 36:42.900
Get out of my way!

36:59.020 --> 37:00.820
So, how long?

37:02.100 --> 37:03.540
A year, if I'm lucky.

37:05.220 --> 37:08.380
I always told you
you'd drink yourself to death.

37:08.380 --> 37:12.580
You told me a lot of things.
And it serves you right...

37:13.580 --> 37:16.620
..running off with that floozy.
I'm not proud of myself.

37:18.020 --> 37:20.660
But I wasn't the same man
that came back from the Front.

37:20.660 --> 37:22.020
The things I'd seen.

37:23.220 --> 37:26.260
Well, I didn't want to
talk about them but you, you...

37:26.260 --> 37:29.180
asked too many questions.
Cared a bit too much.

37:30.500 --> 37:33.420
So I found comfort in the arms of
someone who didn't care much at all.

37:34.820 --> 37:37.340
And where is she now?

37:37.340 --> 37:39.540
Fled to the hills as soon
as the going got tough.

37:41.300 --> 37:42.740
Didn't want to play nurse.

37:44.780 --> 37:46.380
And you think I do?

37:47.700 --> 37:51.220
You're a good woman.
Try hard not to show it, but...

37:52.860 --> 37:55.380
..I know you still love me.

37:56.380 --> 37:59.900
Maybe this is our time.
Maybe it's supposed to be like this.

37:59.900 --> 38:02.100
You and me.

38:02.100 --> 38:05.780
We need each other.
We're both lonely.

38:06.860 --> 38:11.580
I mean, what kind of life is this
for you? Parish secretary? Ha!

38:13.140 --> 38:15.620
Oh, come on, you must be
bored out of your mind.

38:15.620 --> 38:17.420
And who've you got for company?

38:17.420 --> 38:20.460
An infantile priest
and a hoity-toity ice-queen?

38:22.940 --> 38:26.660
If you are talking about
Lady Felicia, I'll have you know,

38:26.660 --> 38:31.580
she is compassionate and cultured
and witty and intelligent!

38:31.580 --> 38:34.780
And a far better companion
than you could ever hope to be!

38:37.780 --> 38:41.380
And... Now, I think
I'd like you to leave.

38:43.260 --> 38:45.020
You don't mean that.

38:58.260 --> 38:59.940
Goodbye, Frank.

39:28.980 --> 39:32.820
I knew what we were doing was wrong,

39:32.820 --> 39:34.140
but I'm not like Eleanor.

39:35.300 --> 39:38.580
When I walk into a room,
I don't turn heads.

39:41.300 --> 39:43.940
I know I was weak, but...

39:43.940 --> 39:45.780
He made you feel special.

39:47.500 --> 39:48.740
For a while.

39:49.820 --> 39:51.500
Until I fell pregnant.

39:54.780 --> 39:56.940
I realised then,
he was never going to leave her.

39:58.860 --> 40:01.500
That it was all a lie.

40:01.500 --> 40:03.260
And the baby?

40:04.980 --> 40:06.660
He told me to get rid of it.

40:07.820 --> 40:11.700
Gave me the address of
a backstreet butcher.

40:18.860 --> 40:20.300
Saint Matilda.

40:20.300 --> 40:22.700
My mother gave me this
on my confirmation.

40:23.940 --> 40:28.100
I remember reaching for it
just before I lost consciousness.

40:30.220 --> 40:32.020
When I couldn't find it, I knew

40:32.020 --> 40:34.020
something dreadful
was going to happen.

40:35.980 --> 40:38.700
Saint Matilda's the patron saint
of large families.

40:40.860 --> 40:43.220
Now, I'm never going
to have children.

40:45.260 --> 40:47.300
I have nothing left to lose.

40:49.420 --> 40:50.820
I'm so sorry.

40:54.220 --> 40:58.340
No-one would have found out
if your secretary hadn't

40:58.340 --> 41:00.900
walked in before I could
put the screws back.

41:05.300 --> 41:06.660
And Eleanor?

41:06.660 --> 41:11.260
When I saw her bag unattended
by the stall,

41:11.260 --> 41:14.100
the way she just carried on
as if nothing had happened,

41:14.100 --> 41:16.980
when my whole world
was falling apart!

41:20.540 --> 41:23.580
But now I'm going straight to Hell,
I'll be stuck with him for ever.

41:23.580 --> 41:27.140
God forgives all those who repent.

41:27.140 --> 41:28.780
Mr Knight never had a chance.

41:28.780 --> 41:30.140
But you do.

41:31.180 --> 41:32.860
No, it's too late.

41:32.860 --> 41:37.100
For William, perhaps.
But not for Eleanor.

41:37.100 --> 41:38.860
You can save her from the scaffold.

41:40.020 --> 41:42.260
You can give her and Kathleen
their lives back,

41:42.260 --> 41:44.980
if you tell the police the truth.

41:48.220 --> 41:50.420
Will you tell the truth, Matilda?

42:00.980 --> 42:02.500
Mummy!

42:21.380 --> 42:22.820
I could have done that.

42:24.380 --> 42:28.820
You too old. Give me the boxes
when finish unpacking.

42:28.820 --> 42:30.020
We go live in them.

42:30.020 --> 42:32.500
Ah! You're both here! Marvellous.

42:32.500 --> 42:34.980
I leave you to it.
Not in a mood for party.

42:36.140 --> 42:38.780
I've just come back
from the town hall.

42:38.780 --> 42:40.180
So?

42:40.180 --> 42:42.860
In order for the power station
to go ahead, the government need

42:42.860 --> 42:44.340
access to the river and railway.

42:44.340 --> 42:46.860
Unfortunately for them,
there's another stretch of land

42:46.860 --> 42:49.540
between the Polish camp and the
station, which they don't own.

42:50.860 --> 42:53.900
So who does the land belong to?

42:53.900 --> 42:55.420
Me.

42:55.420 --> 42:58.420
And, having spoken to my husband,
who has Polish family,

42:58.420 --> 43:02.580
I can confirm, we won't be selling
at any price. And what's more,

43:02.580 --> 43:05.020
given his high-profile connections
in Westminster,

43:05.020 --> 43:07.980
no-one would dare put any pressure
on him to do otherwise.

43:07.980 --> 43:09.220
Oh!

43:10.700 --> 43:12.620
Mind my dress.

43:12.620 --> 43:14.420
We go drink at camp?

43:14.420 --> 43:16.980
Well, perhaps a small glass.

43:18.100 --> 43:19.940
Will Mrs McCarthy join us?

43:19.940 --> 43:24.180
Ah. I'm not sure Mrs McCarthy
has much cause to celebrate.

43:42.020 --> 43:46.460
Oh, Father. Whatever it is,
can it wait until tomorrow?

43:46.460 --> 43:48.260
Not without eating.

43:48.260 --> 43:50.540
If you're talking
about my strawberry scones,

43:50.540 --> 43:52.860
I think you've had your
fair share already today.

43:52.860 --> 43:56.660
I was thinking more
about plankton. Or worms.

44:00.260 --> 44:02.700
I thought, perhaps,
he could do with some company.

44:02.700 --> 44:05.500
And if I remember correctly,
your kitchen faces north.

44:07.260 --> 44:08.940
So it does.
