get out of there.

00:50.684 --> 00:53.419
I'm detecting micro-breaches
throughout the ship.

00:53.421 --> 00:54.653
Weapons and shields are down.

00:54.655 --> 00:56.255

Sub-light engines are back,
and working on FTL.

01:13.474 --> 01:16.075
[THREE] Well, that didn't go
exactly as planned, did it?

01:16.077 --> 01:18.343
But was it a successful
test of the Blink Drive?

01:18.345 --> 01:22.281
No, we fell well short
of our target destination.

01:22.283 --> 01:23.248
[TWO]
How short?

01:23.250 --> 01:25.384
We only traveled 1.2 miles.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.023
What happened?

01:31.024 --> 01:32.257
[THE ANDROID] I'll have to
run a thorough diagnostic,

01:32.259 --> 01:33.826
which may take some time.

01:33.828 --> 01:36.195
The Drive may also require
repair and adjustments,

01:36.197 --> 01:38.230
which could also delay
our next attempt.

01:38.232 --> 01:39.665
Next attempt?

01:39.667 --> 01:41.166
Are you kidding me?

01:41.168 --> 01:42.534
We barely survived
the first one.

01:42.536 --> 01:44.603

It's a distress call
from Regulus-12.

01:52.680 --> 01:55.180

02:08.229 --> 02:09.995
Just the one.

02:09.996 --> 02:11.762

They're ships.

03:02.616 --> 03:04.750
I'm detecting three in all.

03:04.752 --> 03:06.351
Onscreen.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.927
Hang on a sec.

03:14.929 --> 03:17.362
That looks like...

03:17.364 --> 03:18.730
[FOUR]
It can't be.

03:18.732 --> 03:19.698
It's...

03:19.700 --> 03:21.300

03:22.570 --> 03:23.969
It's the Raza.

03:46.260 --> 03:47.693
What the hell was that?

03:47.695 --> 03:49.228
It just disappeared.

03:49.230 --> 03:50.730
How is that possible?

03:50.731 --> 03:52.231
The residual negative
energy I'm detecting

03:52.233 --> 03:53.932
suggests they're in
possession of a Blink Drive

03:53.934 --> 03:55.867
not unlike our own.

03:55.869 --> 03:58.403
Well, a fully functioning one.

I don't know what the hell's
going on, but I've had enough.

Get us out of here.

04:03.310 --> 04:04.776
[ALL grunt]

04:04.778 --> 04:06.395
What was that?

04:06.396 --> 04:08.013
A third Mikkei destroyer
just dropped out of FTL

04:08.015 --> 04:09.514
and opened fire on us.

04:09.516 --> 04:10.766
Can we jump?

04:10.767 --> 04:12.017
FTL engines are still down.

04:14.888 --> 04:16.855
The damage to the Blink Drive
is impeding our ability

04:16.857 --> 04:18.357
to restore them.

We're about to
have more company.

04:41.315 --> 04:43.315
The other two Mikkei ships

04:58.932 --> 05:00.799
We are allies of

05:00.801 --> 05:02.601
We're not looking
for a fight here.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.872
[TRUFFAULT]
This is Commander Truffault.

05:06.874 --> 05:07.973
Truffault?

[TRUFFAULT] What the hell
are you trying to pull?

05:09.076 --> 05:10.475
What's going on?

05:10.477 --> 05:12.010
Why are your ships
attacking us?

05:12.012 --> 05:15.881
[TRUFFAULT] We're attacking
you because we're at war.

05:15.883 --> 05:17.516
What are you talking about?

05:17.518 --> 05:20.319
[TRUFFAULT] You've decimated
a dozen of our outposts,

05:20.321 --> 05:23.588
destroyed three of our ships,
and now you claim you don't

05:23.590 --> 05:26.425
know what's going on.

05:26.427 --> 05:27.926
The fact that you're even
talking to me suggests

05:27.928 --> 05:29.661
there's something wrong
with yo

05:29.663 --> 05:32.331
otherwise, you'd be

05:32.333 --> 05:33.565
How does she know
about the Drive?

05:33.567 --> 05:34.933
[TWO]
I don't know.

05:34.935 --> 05:37.369
[TRUFFAULT] Either you
surrender and let us board,

or we blast you to bits
and pick through your

05:39.340 --> 05:42.107
scattered remnants.

05:43.377 --> 05:45.010
Commander, I don't know
what's going on.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.778
[TRUFFAULT] Your delay
tactics won't work.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.947
The second we pick up
readings of a jump attempt,

05:48.949 --> 05:51.416
we will annihilate you.

05:51.418 --> 05:55.120
Again, awaiting
your decision, Raza.

05:58.625 --> 06:00.926
All right, I promise you
no resistance,

06:00.928 --> 06:03.428
provided you can guarantee
the safety of my crew.

06:03.430 --> 06:06.131
[TRUFFAULT] Turn over the Drive,
and you have a deal.

06:06.133 --> 06:08.600
Done. Raza out.

06:08.602 --> 06:10.769

06:17.978 --> 06:19.544
It's not good.

06:19.546 --> 06:21.446
The Blink Drive is fried.

06:21.448 --> 06:22.981
[TWO]
What about the FTL engines?

06:22.983 --> 06:24.082
[THE ANDROID]
We'll have to re-route

06:24.084 --> 06:25.984
through another access port.

06:25.986 --> 06:27.586
That will take some time.

06:27.588 --> 06:28.620
[TWO]
How long?

06:28.622 --> 06:30.956
Approximately 30 minutes.

06:30.958 --> 06:31.857
Good.

06:31.859 --> 06:33.125
Keep working on it.

06:33.127 --> 06:35.060
We're about to
have some company.

06:56.817 --> 06:58.650
[TWO] I've placed the
sections outside the air lock

06:58.652 --> 07:00.786
and the mess hall
under lockdown.

07:00.788 --> 07:02.187
This is as much
for their protection

07:02.189 --> 07:03.889
as it is for yours.

07:03.891 --> 07:06.525
Do not attack unless engaged.

07:09.096 --> 07:12.063
[TWO] And I need you all
to stay out of sight.

07:13.901 --> 07:17.135
[TWO] We need to draw this out,
buy some time to make repairs.

07:17.137 --> 07:18.804
Once we get the FTL
up and running,

07:18.806 --> 07:20.138
we'll make the jump.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.175
[GRIFFIN] They said they'd
open fire if we tried.

07:23.177 --> 07:24.976
I'm counting on
the fact that they won't--

07:24.978 --> 07:27.112
not with their own
people on board.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.747
Two out.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.083
[TWO]
Shouldn't you be with Five?

07:32.085 --> 07:34.820
She doesn't require
my assistance.

07:34.822 --> 07:37.456
Besides, I've made
a surprising discovery

07:37.458 --> 07:39.858
that I think you
should know about.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.660
I've detected
an anomalous distortion

07:41.662 --> 07:44.629
in the area of the ship's
exit point into normal space.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.231
Right, because we used
the Blink Drive.

07:46.233 --> 07:47.666
[THE ANDROID]
But likely not in the way

07:47.668 --> 07:49.100
in which it was intended.

07:49.102 --> 07:50.635
A slight variance
in the temperature

07:50.637 --> 07:52.137
of the cosmic
microwave background

07:52.139 --> 07:55.574
suggests a highly
unusual possibility:

07:55.576 --> 07:59.010
We may have inadvertently
traveled to a parallel universe.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.512
What?

08:00.513 --> 08:02.013
[THE ANDROID] The multiverse
theory of quantum physics

08:02.014 --> 08:03.514
posits the existence
of alternate worlds

08:03.517 --> 08:05.717
running parallel to our own--

08:05.719 --> 08:07.853
divergent time streams
that may differ slightly

08:07.855 --> 08:09.955
or even significantly
than the reality

08:09.957 --> 08:12.057
that we inhabit.

08:12.059 --> 08:14.059
They can theoretically
be accessed by--

08:14.061 --> 08:15.861
Punching a hole
through space-time.

08:15.863 --> 08:17.929
[THE ANDROID]
It would explain a lot--

08:17.931 --> 08:20.999
Mikkei's unusually
aggressive actions,

08:21.001 --> 08:23.902
Commander Truffault's
knowledge of the Blink Drive,

08:23.904 --> 08:27.739
and, of course, the other Raza.

08:29.877 --> 08:31.943
The rest of the crew will
no doubt have a hard time

08:31.945 --> 08:33.545
believing this.

08:34.681 --> 08:37.182
The rest of the crew is not
who I'm worried about.

08:39.286 --> 08:41.453
Are you done?

08:41.454 --> 08:43.621
If you want to run a scan,
I can give you the coordinates.

08:43.624 --> 08:45.757
I have no interest in either
proving or disproving

08:45.759 --> 08:47.559
your lunatic theory.

08:47.561 --> 08:50.028
I'm here for the Drive.

08:58.105 --> 08:59.304
I'm sure you
have someone on board

08:59.306 --> 09:01.273
who'll be able to
confirm it's genuine.

09:11.785 --> 09:13.718
I gave you the device.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.654
I held up my end of the deal.

09:15.656 --> 09:18.323
And so will I.

09:18.325 --> 09:21.960
I guarantee the safety
of you and your crew...

09:21.962 --> 09:25.564
...until delivery to Central,
at which point my superiors

09:25.566 --> 09:27.799
will decide what to do with you.

09:27.801 --> 09:30.201
I'm afraid it's not
gonna be that simple.

09:30.203 --> 09:32.020
Oh, no?

09:32.021 --> 09:33.838
This section of the ship
is under lockdown.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.173
My crew is armed and hidden.

09:35.175 --> 09:37.208
We won't be going down
without a fight.

09:37.210 --> 09:38.276
[chuckles]

09:38.278 --> 09:42.113
I will just have to
return to my ship, then.

09:42.115 --> 09:44.783
Making it back
might be a problem.

09:47.287 --> 09:50.088
Looks like we're
at an impasse.

09:51.725 --> 09:53.358
Have your men withdraw.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.060
You stay.

09:55.062 --> 09:57.329
Once our FTL is operational,
we will make the jump,

09:57.331 --> 10:00.665
and we will drop you off
at the nearest space station.

10:01.868 --> 10:03.835

10:03.837 --> 10:06.204
Granted, it's damaged,
probably irreparably,

10:06.206 --> 10:07.906
but it's possible
to study its components

10:07.908 --> 10:09.774
and reverse engineer
a working model.

...I believe you mentioned
something about us being allies.

24:47.753 --> 24:50.988
That's why you and the rest
of your crew are here.

24:50.990 --> 24:53.190
Instead of going
from point A to point B

24:53.192 --> 24:55.693
in your reality,
you punched a hole

24:55.695 --> 24:59.163
through space-time
and ended up here,

24:59.165 --> 25:02.500
where our Ishida
reclaimed his throne.

25:02.502 --> 25:04.902
Something you obviously
haven't done...

25:04.904 --> 25:07.638
...not yet.

25:07.640 --> 25:08.906
Mind you, I don't know
how you're gonna do that

25:08.908 --> 25:10.574
without the Blink Drive.

25:10.576 --> 25:12.877
Well, how did he do it?

25:12.879 --> 25:15.813
Little help from his friends.

25:17.617 --> 25:19.116
Go on.

25:21.787 --> 25:23.921
I can vent the
atmosphere in there,

25:23.923 --> 25:26.590
stand here, and watch you die.

25:26.592 --> 25:27.892
I'm shaking.

25:27.894 --> 25:28.926
Try me.

25:28.928 --> 25:31.095
[PORTIA]
Mmm.

25:31.097 --> 25:35.165
After Eos-7, the Corporations
backing Pyr pulled out.

25:35.167 --> 25:37.101
They had bigger things
to worry about,

25:37.103 --> 25:38.936
so we took advantage
and helped Zairon

25:38.938 --> 25:40.137
destroy their fleet.

25:40.139 --> 25:43.974
And they welcomed
you back with open arms.

25:43.976 --> 25:46.577
Did I have allies
in the palace?

25:46.579 --> 25:48.913
You made a deal with
a couple of old friends,

25:48.915 --> 25:50.314
members of the
royal court who you knew

25:50.316 --> 25:51.715
you could still trust.

25:51.717 --> 25:54.685
Your stepbrother,
Hiro, was one of them.

25:54.687 --> 25:58.255
That came back to
bite you in the ass.

25:58.257 --> 26:00.458
How?

26:00.459 --> 26:02.660
He started lobbying
for democratic rights.

26:02.662 --> 26:04.194
But you put an end to that.

26:04.196 --> 26:06.063
[rasps softly]

26:06.065 --> 26:08.866
[PORTIA] The Ryo we know
can make the hard decisions

26:08.868 --> 26:11.869
and exploit
the right opportunities.

26:13.839 --> 26:16.774
What's holding you back, hmm?

26:20.246 --> 26:21.745
[TWO] I know
what you're thinking--

26:21.747 --> 26:23.647
Ferrous Corp. is
too busy fighting a war

26:23.649 --> 26:26.216
to worry about some
insignificant mining community.

26:26.218 --> 26:27.818
But you're wrong.

26:27.820 --> 26:29.019
They're gonna come down
on you hard,

26:29.021 --> 26:30.788
because if they don't,
it'll send a message

26:30.790 --> 26:32.957
to every other insignificant
mining community

26:32.959 --> 26:36.060
that Ferrous is weak and can't
keep its own house in order.

26:36.062 --> 26:38.128
We won't be intimidated.

26:38.130 --> 26:39.763
[TWO]
You don't understand.

26:39.765 --> 26:40.364
We're not here to--

26:40.366 --> 26:41.966
[groans]

26:48.808 --> 26:49.707
[grunts]

26:49.709 --> 26:51.642
What the hell?!

26:51.644 --> 26:53.277
Said you could do the talking.

26:53.279 --> 26:54.812
[WOMAN moaning]

26:54.813 --> 26:56.346
I didn't say anything
about the shooting.

26:56.349 --> 26:57.948
Time to move.

27:01.053 --> 27:02.853
Let her go.

27:02.855 --> 27:03.387
What, you mean alive?

27:03.389 --> 27:05.356
Yes, alive.

27:05.358 --> 27:06.957
Now.

27:09.128 --> 27:10.794
The hell is your problem today?

27:12.898 --> 27:14.198
[WEXLER]
Raza, this is the Marauder.

27:14.200 --> 27:15.983
[JACE]
So do we spank them?

27:15.984 --> 27:17.767
Affirmative. Prep it.
We're on our way back.

27:17.770 --> 27:18.669
Prep what?

27:18.671 --> 27:20.204
[WEXLER]
The nuke.

27:20.205 --> 27:21.738
This mining colony's
about to learn the hard way,

27:21.741 --> 27:23.240
you don't mess
with Ferrous Corp.

27:30.916 --> 27:32.349
Raza, this is the Marauder.

27:32.351 --> 27:33.050
[JACE]
Yeah?

27:33.052 --> 27:34.318
Stand down.

27:34.320 --> 27:35.285
[JACE]
What?

27:35.287 --> 27:37.655
I'm ordering you
to stand down.

27:37.657 --> 27:40.057
And what have I told you
about giving me orders?

27:40.059 --> 27:41.325
I don't know what the
hell you think--

27:41.327 --> 27:42.893
Shut up.

27:42.895 --> 27:46.030
We are not dropping
a nuke on this facility.

27:46.032 --> 27:48.399
Why not?

27:48.400 --> 27:50.767
[TWO] Because there's another
way to deal with this situation.

27:50.770 --> 27:53.170
Sure, but we don't have
time to shoot them all.

27:53.172 --> 27:56.306
A way that doesn't involve
anyone getting killed.

27:58.844 --> 28:00.761
[TWO]
Corso?

28:00.762 --> 28:02.679
Hey, do I need to remind you
we have a job to do here?

28:02.682 --> 28:04.815
And we will get it done,
but not by destroying

28:04.817 --> 28:06.884
this colony and everyone in it.

28:08.854 --> 28:11.455
Corso, do you copy?

28:11.457 --> 28:12.256
Corso, do--

28:12.258 --> 28:13.857
[console beeps]

28:16.295 --> 28:17.428
What?

28:17.430 --> 28:20.431
Something's up.

28:20.433 --> 28:21.432
What do you mean?

28:21.434 --> 28:24.101
You're acting strange.

28:24.837 --> 28:26.303
What happened
on that space station?

28:26.305 --> 28:28.038
What did Ishida say to you?

28:29.008 --> 28:30.140
-I'll tell you back on the ship.

28:30.142 --> 28:31.842
You'll tell me now.

29:18.791 --> 29:19.423
[THE ANDROID]
Hello.

29:19.425 --> 29:20.858
Huh?

29:20.860 --> 29:21.959
Oh, hey.

29:21.961 --> 29:24.011
As this ship's
service android,

29:24.012 --> 29:26.062
it's my duty to inform the
crew of any impending danger.

29:26.065 --> 29:27.290
Yeah.

29:27.291 --> 29:28.516
[THE ANDROID]
In this case,

29:28.517 --> 29:29.742
it's the nuclear missile
we just launched

29:29.743 --> 29:30.968
that's headed towards
the planet's surface,

29:30.970 --> 29:32.803
where the Marauder
is presently located

29:32.805 --> 29:33.937
What?

29:33.939 --> 29:35.439
Can you override
its nav systems?

29:35.441 --> 29:37.274
Unfortunately, I can't.

29:37.276 --> 29:38.876
Oh, man.

29:56.128 --> 29:57.528
Shit.

30:08.274 --> 30:11.074
[beeping]

30:11.310 --> 30:13.377
[JACE]
Boom.

30:13.379 --> 30:14.978
Good night, Portia.

30:16.515 --> 30:18.348
You shifty son of a bitch.

30:18.350 --> 30:20.384
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

30:20.386 --> 30:21.352
What's up?

30:21.353 --> 30:22.319
You launched that nuke
while she was still

30:22.321 --> 30:25.322
down on the planet

30:25.324 --> 30:27.157
Yeah, The Android told me.

30:27.159 --> 30:29.359
That little snitch.

30:29.361 --> 30:32.596
I'm gonna have to re-jig
her neural interface...

30:32.598 --> 30:34.231
...but yours first.

30:34.233 --> 30:35.833
Yeah?

30:53.853 --> 30:55.452
Hello, lover.

30:58.090 --> 31:00.891
[TASH] I'll never forget the
first time I ever punched you.

31:00.893 --> 31:02.426
You told me
I hit like a girl.

31:02.428 --> 31:04.061
You do.

31:04.063 --> 31:07.998
You hit like a super-fit,
well-trained, scary, scary girl.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.869
For months, Corso's been
secretly gunning for you two,

31:11.871 --> 31:14.104
and I'm the only reason
you're still alive.

31:14.106 --> 31:16.440
Well, then I'm sure we can
both appreciate the irony

31:16.442 --> 31:19.109
of you standing over me
with that knife.

31:19.111 --> 31:21.011
[TWO]
Tash.

31:24.350 --> 31:26.049
You're on the
wrong side of this.

31:26.051 --> 31:28.552
Corso just tired to kill Wexler
and me down on that planet.

31:28.554 --> 31:30.387
He launched an orbital nuke
while we were still

31:30.389 --> 31:31.488
on the surface.

31:31.490 --> 31:32.489
Where is Wexler?

31:32.491 --> 31:34.258
He's back on the Marauder.

31:35.160 --> 31:36.660
Wexler, it's Tash.
Come in.

31:36.662 --> 31:39.263
He can't respond right now.

31:39.265 --> 31:40.597
Why not?

31:40.599 --> 31:43.934
Because he's unconscious,
but let me explain.

31:46.639 --> 31:49.072
Do we really have
to do this... again?

33:01.613 --> 33:03.213
[groans]

33:05.284 --> 33:07.250
As this ship's
service android,

33:07.252 --> 33:10.287
it's my duty to protect
the crew from harm...

33:10.289 --> 33:13.156
...and, on occasion,
each other.

33:13.158 --> 33:14.524
[BOTH grunt]

33:14.526 --> 33:16.126
Thank you.

33:16.128 --> 33:17.527
You're welcome.

33:28.073 --> 33:30.173
[GRIFFIN] You know why our Two
and Three aren't like them?

33:32.144 --> 33:34.411
Because of you.

33:34.413 --> 33:36.680
I don't know exactly
what happened,

33:36.682 --> 33:39.783
but in this reality, you weren't
there to save my life.

33:39.785 --> 33:42.452
There was no mind wipe, and...

33:42.454 --> 33:44.321
...everything turned
out different.

33:47.493 --> 33:50.093
[THE ANDROID] Sorry to
interrupt, but a Mikkei cruiser

33:50.095 --> 33:51.561
just dropped out of FTL.

33:51.563 --> 33:54.531
It launched a shuttle which
should be arriving shortly.

34:00.372 --> 34:01.772
[FOUR]
Lock us down.

34:11.116 --> 34:12.616
Any word from your people?

34:12.618 --> 34:14.217
Not yet.

34:16.588 --> 34:18.188
[BOTH groan]

34:23.262 --> 34:24.661
[TRUFFAULT]
Hmm.

34:54.560 --> 34:56.159
Something's wrong.

35:01.333 --> 35:02.666
Shut down.

35:02.668 --> 35:04.267
No.

35:06.472 --> 35:07.871
Do I have to shoot her?

35:11.510 --> 35:13.110
No.

35:16.582 --> 35:18.648
Bridge is secure.

35:18.650 --> 35:20.417
We have the Raza.

35:35.334 --> 35:36.733
[TWO]
Raza, this is Two.

35:36.735 --> 35:38.313
What's your situation?

35:38.314 --> 35:39.892
[TRUFFAULT]
I would best describe

35:39.893 --> 35:41.471
your current
situation as... dire.

35:41.473 --> 35:42.873
Truffault?

35:42.875 --> 35:44.441
What the hell's going on?

35:44.443 --> 35:47.711
Oh, please, this is just
a preemptive double-cross.

35:48.714 --> 35:50.147
[TWO]
I thought we had a deal.

35:50.149 --> 35:51.781
[TRUFFAULT] We did...
a deal you never had

35:51.783 --> 35:54.618
any intention of honoring.
We both know that.

35:54.620 --> 35:58.755
So, here's the new deal:
The lives of your people

35:58.757 --> 36:01.558
in exchange for the Drive.

36:03.428 --> 36:07.697
[TRUFFAULT] Look,
this universe or your own.

36:07.699 --> 36:09.633
What difference does it make?

36:09.635 --> 36:12.435
I mean, what the hell is
waiting for you back there?

36:12.437 --> 36:14.905
Our own mess.

36:14.907 --> 36:16.506
[sighs]

36:18.644 --> 36:22.412
The lives of your
people for the Drive.

36:22.414 --> 36:23.713
What's it gonna be?

36:36.895 --> 36:38.461
[SERGEANT]
The shuttle just docked.

36:38.463 --> 36:40.714
Good.

36:40.715 --> 36:42.966
Sergeant, as soon I confirm
we have the Blink Drive,

36:42.968 --> 36:45.936
you can bring the prisoners
down to the air lock.

36:45.938 --> 36:47.537
Roger that.

36:59.451 --> 37:00.851
[TRUFFAULT]
What is this?

37:00.852 --> 37:02.252
[SERGEANT]
Commander, this is the bridge.

37:02.253 --> 37:03.653
Something's wrong. We're locked
out of all controls.

37:03.655 --> 37:04.921
No, that's impossible.

37:04.923 --> 37:06.790
[TWO]
Sorry about this, Commander.

37:06.792 --> 37:08.325
I assume you had to
take out our android

37:08.327 --> 37:09.960
to get control of the Raza.

37:09.962 --> 37:12.395
That's fine.
We've got another one.

37:12.397 --> 37:14.331
And you just let her
on board your ship.

37:17.236 --> 37:19.569
[SERGEANT] Commander,
we're powering weapons.

37:31.617 --> 37:32.582
Wow.

37:32.584 --> 37:34.784
Didn't expect that.

37:34.786 --> 37:38.021
Looks like you just took out
their aft shield generator.

37:38.023 --> 37:40.690
All right, they're in no
position to take on one Raza,

37:40.692 --> 37:42.392
let alone two.

37:42.394 --> 37:44.027
So what's it gonna be?

37:59.945 --> 38:01.411
That's my coat.

38:01.413 --> 38:03.513
Not anymore.

38:03.515 --> 38:04.848
Where's Truffault?

38:04.850 --> 38:07.284
We already sent her
back to her ship.

38:07.286 --> 38:08.885
I gotta say,
I can't believe you

38:08.887 --> 38:12.422
work with that bitch.

38:12.423 --> 38:15.958
[TWO] Hmm. Well, ours seems
a little bit nicer. A little.

38:15.961 --> 38:18.528
Oh, by the way, you'll
find your crew members

38:18.530 --> 38:19.929
tied up in the mess.

38:28.540 --> 38:30.440
There you are.

38:30.442 --> 38:32.542
I'm happy to see you're up
and running again.

38:32.544 --> 38:34.077
Thank you.

38:34.079 --> 38:36.813
I understand you've decided
to return to your ship.

38:36.815 --> 38:39.416
My presence on this Raza
would be redundant.

38:39.418 --> 38:42.886
Besides, my loyalty
is to my crew...

38:42.888 --> 38:45.021
...and to Portia in particular.

38:45.023 --> 38:47.457
I owe her a debt of gratitude.

38:47.459 --> 38:48.491
For what?

38:48.493 --> 38:50.327
For making me what I am.

39:04.943 --> 39:06.543
Stand by.

39:14.853 --> 39:19.456
The Blink Drive is... online.

39:23.628 --> 39:25.562
I've completed
the nav calculations.

39:25.564 --> 39:26.963
We're good to go.

39:26.965 --> 39:28.765
You sure this is gonna work?

39:28.767 --> 39:30.800
Returning us to our
original point of departure

39:30.802 --> 39:33.002
should be relatively
straightforward.

39:33.004 --> 39:35.472
Outside of the theoretical
possibility of an overload

39:35.474 --> 39:37.474
that could destroy this ship.

39:37.476 --> 39:38.908
But the chances of that
are so remote,

39:38.910 --> 39:40.610
they're hardly worth
mentioning.

39:40.612 --> 39:43.646

1:04:57.994 --> 1:04:59.293
We're their
representatives.

1:04:59.295 --> 1:05:00.594
We're here to speak
on their behalf.

1:05:00.596 --> 1:05:03.064
Yeah, there ain't
nothing to talk about.

1:05:03.066 --> 1:05:04.498
We're declaring independence.

1:05:04.500 --> 1:05:06.667
You know Ferrous Corp.
isn't gonna let that happen.

1:05:06.669 --> 1:05:09.570
[MINING LEADER] Well, maybe we
need to show them we're serious.

1:05:09.572 --> 1:05:12.039
Willing to kill
for our freedom...

1:05:12.041 --> 1:05:13.607
...starting with you two.

1:05:15.678 --> 1:05:17.712
[TWO] Push comes to shove,
most would be willing to kill

1:05:17.714 --> 1:05:19.246
for their freedom.

1:05:19.248 --> 1:05:22.249
Willing to die?
That's another matter.

1:05:22.251 --> 1:05:23.751
Now, trust me,
there'll be plenty of time

1:05:23.753 --> 1:05:25.453
for both later.

1:05:25.455 --> 1:05:27.488
Right now, we just wanna talk.

1:05:32.095 --> 1:05:33.494
After you.

1:05:58.321 --> 1:05:59.720
[TASH]
Hey!

1:06:09.565 --> 1:06:11.532
[THREE]
Hey. What's up?

1:06:11.534 --> 1:06:12.666
[grunts]

1:06:12.668 --> 1:06:13.734
[THREE]
Mmm.

1:06:14.771 --> 1:06:16.037
Ah.

1:06:16.039 --> 1:06:17.405
Um, you know...

1:06:18.708 --> 1:06:20.207
[THREE]
Mmm.

1:06:20.209 --> 1:06:22.443
[THREE shouts, coughs]

1:06:26.816 --> 1:06:29.750
[grunts, groans]

1:06:29.752 --> 1:06:31.352
Hi.

1:06:34.190 --> 1:06:35.423
What?

1:06:35.424 --> 1:06:36.657
Maybe this isn't a good time.

1:06:36.659 --> 1:06:38.426
[TASH]
What are you talking about?

1:06:38.427 --> 1:06:40.194
We got maybe 20 minutes
before they get back.

1:06:40.196 --> 1:06:41.695
That's kinda tight, isn't it?

1:06:41.697 --> 1:06:43.230
Are you serious?

1:06:43.232 --> 1:06:46.167
Twenty minutes would
be a record for you.

1:06:46.169 --> 1:06:47.568
Really?

1:06:53.810 --> 1:06:55.643
Okay, look...

1:06:57.447 --> 1:07:01.482
Yeah, I've had a bad day,
and maybe we can just, uh...

1:07:01.484 --> 1:07:03.484
...pick it up again
tomorrow, all right?

1:07:09.659 --> 1:07:11.258
Ugh!

1:07:12.528 --> 1:07:14.128
Can't believe you
still fall for that.

1:07:14.697 --> 1:07:17.131
[groans]

1:07:17.133 --> 1:07:18.532
Later, loser.

1:07:20.803 --> 1:07:22.670
[grunts]

1:07:22.672 --> 1:07:24.271
Ugh.

1:07:43.793 --> 1:07:45.392
You tested the device
without making

1:07:45.394 --> 1:07:47.228
the proper adjustments.

1:07:47.230 --> 1:07:49.396
You didn't account for
temporal displacement.

1:07:49.398 --> 1:07:52.633
That's why you and the rest
of your crew are here.

1:07:52.635 --> 1:07:54.835
Instead of going
from point A to point B

1:07:54.837 --> 1:07:57.338
in your reality,
you punched a hole

1:07:57.340 --> 1:08:00.808
through space-time
and ended up here,

1:08:00.810 --> 1:08:04.145
where our Ishida
reclaimed his throne.

1:08:04.147 --> 1:08:06.547
Something you obviously
haven't done...

1:08:06.549 --> 1:08:09.283
...not yet.

1:08:09.285 --> 1:08:10.551
Mind you, I don't know
how you're gonna do that

1:08:10.553 --> 1:08:12.219
without the Blink Drive.

1:08:12.221 --> 1:08:14.522
Well, how did he do it?

1:08:14.524 --> 1:08:17.458
Little help from his friends.

1:08:19.262 --> 1:08:20.761
Go on.

1:08:23.432 --> 1:08:25.566
I can vent the
atmosphere in there,

1:08:25.568 --> 1:08:28.235
stand here, and watch you die.

1:08:28.237 --> 1:08:29.537
I'm shaking.

1:08:29.539 --> 1:08:30.571
Try me.

1:08:30.573 --> 1:08:32.740
[PORTIA]
Mmm.

1:08:32.742 --> 1:08:36.810
After Eos-7, the Corporations
backing Pyr pulled out.

1:08:36.812 --> 1:08:38.746
They had bigger things
to worry about,

1:08:38.748 --> 1:08:40.581
so we took advantage
and helped Zairon

1:08:40.583 --> 1:08:41.782
destroy their fleet.

1:08:41.784 --> 1:08:45.619
And they welcomed
you back with open arms.

1:08:45.621 --> 1:08:48.222
Did I have allies
in the palace?

1:08:48.224 --> 1:08:50.558
You made a deal with
a couple of old friends,

1:08:50.560 --> 1:08:51.959
members of the
royal court who you knew

1:08:51.961 --> 1:08:53.360
you could still trust.

1:08:53.362 --> 1:08:56.330
Your stepbrother,
Hiro, was one of them.

1:08:56.332 --> 1:08:59.900
That came back to
bite you in the ass.

1:08:59.902 --> 1:09:02.103
How?

1:09:02.104 --> 1:09:04.305
He started lobbying
for democratic rights.

1:09:04.307 --> 1:09:05.839
But you put an end to that.

1:09:05.841 --> 1:09:07.708
[rasps softly]

1:09:07.710 --> 1:09:10.511
[PORTIA] The Ryo we know
can make the hard decisions

1:09:10.513 --> 1:09:13.514
and exploit
the right opportunities.

1:09:15.484 --> 1:09:18.419
What's holding you back, hmm?

1:09:21.891 --> 1:09:23.390
[TWO] I know
what you're thinking--

1:09:23.392 --> 1:09:25.292
Ferrous Corp. is
too busy fighting a war

1:09:25.294 --> 1:09:27.861
to worry about some
insignificant mining community.

1:09:27.863 --> 1:09:29.463
But you're wrong.

1:09:29.465 --> 1:09:30.664
They're gonna come down
on you hard,

1:09:30.666 --> 1:09:32.433
because if they don't,
it'll send a message

1:09:32.435 --> 1:09:34.602
to every other insignificant
mining community

1:09:34.604 --> 1:09:37.705
that Ferrous is weak and can't
keep its own house in order.

1:09:37.707 --> 1:09:39.773
We won't be intimidated.

1:09:39.775 --> 1:09:41.408
[TWO]
You don't understand.

1:09:41.410 --> 1:09:42.009
We're not here to--

1:09:42.011 --> 1:09:43.611
[groans]

1:09:50.453 --> 1:09:51.352

1:09:51.354 --> 1:09:53.287
What the hell?!

1:09:53.289 --> 1:09:54.922
Said you could do the talking.

1:09:54.924 --> 1:09:56.457
[WOMAN moaning]

1:09:56.458 --> 1:09:57.991
I didn't say anything
about the shooting.

1:09:57.994 --> 1:09:59.593
Time to move.

1:10:02.698 --> 1:10:04.498
Let her go.

1:10:04.500 --> 1:10:05.032
What, you mean alive?

1:10:05.034 --> 1:10:07.001
Yes, alive.

1:10:07.003 --> 1:10:08.602
Now.

1:10:10.773 --> 1:10:12.439
The hell is your problem today?

1:10:14.543 --> 1:10:15.843
[WEXLER]
Raza, this is the Marauder.

1:10:15.845 --> 1:10:17.628
[JACE]
So do we spank them?

1:10:17.629 --> 1:10:19.412
Affirmative. Prep it.
We're on our way back.

1:10:19.415 --> 1:10:20.314
Prep what?

1:10:20.316 --> 1:10:21.849
[WEXLER]
The nuke.

1:10:21.850 --> 1:10:23.383
This mining colony's
about to learn the hard way,

1:10:23.386 --> 1:10:24.885
you don't mess
with Ferrous Corp.

1:10:32.561 --> 1:10:33.994
Raza, this is the Marauder.

1:10:33.996 --> 1:10:34.695
[JACE]
Yeah?

1:10:34.697 --> 1:10:35.963
Stand down.

1:10:35.965 --> 1:10:36.930
[JACE]
What?

1:10:36.932 --> 1:10:39.300
I'm ordering you
to stand down.

1:10:39.302 --> 1:10:41.702
And what have I told you
about giving me orders?

1:10:41.704 --> 1:10:42.970
I don't know what the
hell you think--

1:10:42.972 --> 1:10:44.538
Shut up.

1:10:44.540 --> 1:10:47.675
We are not dropping
a nuke on this facility.

1:10:47.677 --> 1:10:50.044
Why not?

1:10:50.045 --> 1:10:52.412
[TWO] Because there's another
way to deal with this situation.

1:10:52.415 --> 1:10:54.815
Sure, but we don't have
time to shoot them all.

1:10:54.817 --> 1:10:57.951
A way that doesn't involve
anyone getting killed.

1:11:00.489 --> 1:11:02.406

Corso?

1:11:02.407 --> 1:11:04.324
Hey, do I need to remind you
we have a job to do here?

1:11:04.327 --> 1:11:06.460
And we will get it done,
but not by destroying

1:11:06.462 --> 1:11:08.529

1:11:19.075 --> 1:11:22.076
Something's up.

1:11:22.078 --> 1:11:23.077
What do you mean?

1:11:23.079 --> 1:11:25.746
You're acting strange.

1:11:26.482 --> 1:11:27.948
What happened
on that space station?

1:11:27.950 --> 1:11:29.683
What did Ishida say to you?

1:11:30.653 --> 1:11:31.785
-I'll tell you back on the ship.

1:11:31.787 --> 1:11:33.487
You'll tell me now.

[THE ANDROID]
Hello.

1:12:21.070 --> 1:12:22.503
Huh?

1:12:22.505 --> 1:12:23.604
Oh, hey.

1:12:23.606 --> 1:12:25.656
As this ship's

1:12:25.657 --> 1:12:27.707
it's my duty to inform the
crew of any impending danger.

1:12:27.710 --> 1:12:28.935
Yeah.

1:12:28.936 --> 1:12:30.161
[THE ANDROID]
In this case,

1:12:30.162 --> 1:12:31.387
it's the nuclear missile
we just launched

1:12:31.388 --> 1:12:32.613
that's headed towards
the planet's surface,

1:12:32.615 --> 1:12:34.448

is presently located

1:12:34.450 --> 1:12:35.582

1:12:35.584 --> 1:12:37.084
Can you override
its nav systems?

1:12:37.086 --> 1:12:38.919
Unfortunately, I can't.

Oh, man.

it's a bad thing.

while she was still

1:13:23.966 --> 1:13:26.967
down on the planet

1:13:26.969 --> 1:13:28.802
Yeah, The Android told me.

I hit like a girl.

secretly gunning for you two,

1:14:13.516 --> 1:14:15.749
and I'm the only reason
you're still alive.

1:14:15.751 --> 1:14:18.085

both appreciate the irony

1:14:18.087 --> 1:14:20.754

1:18:39.959 --> 1:18:41.537
[TRUFFAULT]
I would best describe

1:18:41.538 --> 1:18:43.116
your current
situation as... dire.

1:18:43.118 --> 1:18:44.518
Truffault?

1:18:44.520 --> 1:18:46.086
What the hell's going on?

1:18:46.088 --> 1:18:49.356
Oh, please, this is just
a preemptive double-cross.

1:18:50.359 --> 1:18:51.792
[TWO]
I thought we had a deal.

1:18:51.794 --> 1:18:53.426
[TRUFFAULT] We did...
a deal you never had

1:18:53.428 --> 1:18:56.263
any intention of honoring.
We both know that.

1:18:56.265 --> 1:19:00.400
So, here's the new deal:
The lives of your people

1:19:00.402 --> 1:19:03.203
in exchange for the Drive.

1:19:05.073 --> 1:19:09.342
[TRUFFAULT] Look,
this universe or your own.

1:19:09.344 --> 1:19:11.278
What difference does it make?

1:19:11.280 --> 1:19:14.080
I mean, what the hell is
waiting for you back there?

1:19:14.082 --> 1:19:16.550
Our own mess.

1:19:16.552 --> 1:19:18.151
[sighs]

1:19:20.289 --> 1:19:24.057
The lives of your
people for the Drive.

1:19:24.059 --> 1:19:25.358
What's it gonna be?

1:19:38.540 --> 1:19:40.106
[SERGEANT]
The shuttle just docked.

1:19:40.108 --> 1:19:42.359
Good.

1:19:42.360 --> 1:19:44.611
Sergeant, as soon I confirm
we have the Blink Drive,

1:19:44.613 --> 1:19:47.581
you can bring the prisoners
down to the air lock.

1:19:47.583 --> 1:19:49.182
Roger that.

1:20:01.096 --> 1:20:02.496
[TRUFFAULT]
What is this?

1:20:02.497 --> 1:20:03.897
[SERGEANT]
Commander, this is the bridge.

1:20:03.898 --> 1:20:05.298
Something's wrong. We're locked
out of all controls.

1:20:05.300 --> 1:20:06.566
No, that's impossible.

1:20:06.568 --> 1:20:08.435
[TWO]
Sorry about this, Commander.

1:20:08.437 --> 1:20:09.970
I assume you had to
take out our android

1:20:09.972 --> 1:20:11.605
to get control of the Raza.

1:20:11.607 --> 1:20:14.040
That's fine.
We've got another one.

1:20:14.042 --> 1:20:15.976
And you just let her
on board your ship.

1:20:18.881 --> 1:20:21.214
[SERGEANT] Commander,
we're powering weapons.

1:20:33.262 --> 1:20:34.227
Wow.

1:20:34.229 --> 1:20:36.429
Didn't expect that.

1:20:36.431 --> 1:20:39.666
Looks like you just took out
their aft shield generator.

1:20:39.668 --> 1:20:42.335
All right, they're in no
position to take on one Raza,

1:20:42.337 --> 1:20:44.037
let alone two.

1:20:44.039 --> 1:20:45.672
So what's it gonna be?

1:21:01.590 --> 1:21:03.056
That's my coat.

1:21:03.058 --> 1:21:05.158
Not anymore.

1:21:05.160 --> 1:21:06.493
Where's Truffault?

1:21:06.495 --> 1:21:08.929
We already sent her
back to her ship.

1:21:08.931 --> 1:21:10.530
I gotta say,
I can't believe you

1:21:10.532 --> 1:21:14.067
work with that bitch.

1:21:14.068 --> 1:21:17.603
[TWO] Hmm. Well, ours seems
a little bit nicer. A little.

1:21:17.606 --> 1:21:20.173
Oh, by the way, you'll
find your crew members

1:21:20.175 --> 1:21:21.574
tied up in the mess.

1:21:30.185 --> 1:21:32.085
There you are.

1:21:32.087 --> 1:21:34.187
I'm happy to see you're up
and running again.

1:21:34.189 --> 1:21:35.722
Thank you.

1:21:35.724 --> 1:21:38.458
I understand you've decided
to return to your ship.

1:21:38.460 --> 1:21:41.061
My presence on this Raza
would be redundant.

1:21:41.063 --> 1:21:44.531
Besides, my loyalty
is to my crew...

1:21:44.533 --> 1:21:46.666
...and to Portia in particular.

1:21:46.668 --> 1:21:49.102
I owe her a debt of gratitude.

1:21:49.104 --> 1:21:50.136
For what?

1:21:50.138 --> 1:21:51.972
For making me what I am.

1:22:06.588 --> 1:22:08.188
Stand by.

1:22:16.498 --> 1:22:21.101
The Blink Drive is... online.

1:22:25.273 --> 1:22:27.207
I've completed
the nav calculations.

1:22:27.209 --> 1:22:28.608
We're good to go.

1:22:28.610 --> 1:22:30.410
You sure this is gonna work?

1:22:30.412 --> 1:22:32.445
Returning us to our
original point of departure

1:22:32.447 --> 1:22:34.647
should be relatively
straightforward.

1:22:34.649 --> 1:22:37.117
Outside of the theoretical
possibility of an overload

1:22:37.119 --> 1:22:39.119
that could destroy this ship.

1:22:39.121 --> 1:22:40.553
But the chances of that
are so remote,

1:22:40.555 --> 1:22:42.255
they're hardly worth
mentioning.

1:22:42.257 --> 1:22:45.291
[THREE]
And... yet you did.

1:22:45.293 --> 1:22:46.526
Let's do this.

1:22:46.528 --> 1:22:48.395
All right, everybody, get ready.

1:22:52.367 --> 1:22:53.666
[THREE clears throat]

1:23:09.184 --> 1:23:13.086
No pops, no sparks, no alarms...

1:23:13.088 --> 1:23:15.322
Looks promising.

1:23:15.323 --> 1:23:17.557
I'm detecting something--
a small vessel.

1:23:17.559 --> 1:23:19.259
It appears to have
just detached itself

1:23:19.261 --> 1:23:20.427
from the outer hull.

1:23:20.429 --> 1:23:21.828
Give us a visual.

1:23:23.465 --> 1:23:24.330
[GRIFFIN]
It's the Marauder.

1:23:24.332 --> 1:23:26.266
That's not our Marauder.

1:23:26.268 --> 1:23:28.501
Android, prepare to intercept.

1:23:31.339 --> 1:23:32.705
I'm sorry, Two.

1:23:32.707 --> 1:23:36.109
It appears this
Marauder was FTL capable.

1:23:36.111 --> 1:23:38.278
Who the hell did we
just bring back with us?

1:23:46.655 --> 1:23:49.622
We're within range
of Regulus-12's data hub.

1:23:49.624 --> 1:23:51.157
Stand by.

1:23:51.159 --> 1:23:53.226
Nice job, Kid.

1:23:53.228 --> 1:23:55.495
The station is
broadcasting normally.

1:23:55.497 --> 1:23:57.363
It worked.

1:23:57.365 --> 1:23:58.765
[TWO]
All right.

1:23:58.767 --> 1:24:00.633
Set a course for the station.

1:24:00.635 --> 1:24:02.469
Let's go get our people.

1:24:03.738 --> 1:24:05.338
Yeah...

1:24:13.482 --> 1:24:15.548
Any word about Devon?

1:24:15.550 --> 1:24:18.184
Nyx says she waited
for him for hours,

1:24:18.186 --> 1:24:19.853
and he never showed.

1:24:19.855 --> 1:24:22.288
--[THREE] Huh.
--He's not answering his comm.

1:24:23.892 --> 1:24:26.526
[THREE]
Wow.

1:24:26.528 --> 1:24:30.330
Sounds to me like he
decided to move on.

1:24:31.433 --> 1:24:33.033
Why would he do that?

1:24:33.034 --> 1:24:34.634
He wouldn't leave without
at least saying goodbye.

1:24:34.636 --> 1:24:36.436
How do you know?

1:24:36.438 --> 1:24:38.138
I mean, I'm sorry,
but did any of us

1:24:38.140 --> 1:24:39.539
really know the guy?
