Welcome to Altura.

Or if George has anything to say
about it, soon to be Newmerica.

00:06.223 --> 00:07.572
This is Roman Estes.

00:07.616 --> 00:09.966
He is the reason we have water
and power.

00:10.836 --> 00:12.447
She must really
be something, that George.

00:12.490 --> 00:15.319
I've laid down my life for her
many times.

00:15.363 --> 00:17.713
Are you gonna vote yes
on the new constitution?

00:17.756 --> 00:20.150
She says we should be
one nation.

00:20.585 --> 00:22.413
I vote Newmerica.

00:23.110 --> 00:25.025
Yeah, well what's
the alternative?

00:25.460 --> 00:27.375
Burn it all down.

00:27.636 --> 00:29.072
Let's get her up here. George!

George! George! George!

00:30.682 --> 00:31.857
Wish me luck.

01:10.679 --> 01:12.072
George!

01:34.050 --> 01:36.531
What...happened?

01:38.533 --> 01:40.317
Are we dead?

01:47.063 --> 01:48.717
Not everybody.

Oh shit.

Oh jeez. Uh...

02:04.950 --> 02:06.169
Hold still.

02:08.563 --> 02:12.001
You know what,
help will be here soon!

02:12.044 --> 02:15.091
You're gonna be fine. All right?

George?!

02:41.770 --> 02:42.423
You okay?

02:42.466 --> 02:43.815
What happened?

02:43.859 --> 02:45.556
Some kind of explosion!

02:46.035 --> 02:46.862
Doc!

02:48.124 --> 02:49.560
Hey, Doc.

02:55.436 --> 02:57.177

02:59.222 --> 03:01.006
CZ, what the...what happened?

03:01.050 --> 03:02.834
I dunno. Some kind of explosion.

03:02.878 --> 03:04.575
Where's Dante

03:04.619 --> 03:05.924
Haven't seen them.

03:05.968 --> 03:07.491
Let's help these people.

03:09.058 --> 03:10.451
First responders are rushing in

03:10.494 --> 03:12.757
to aid those injured
in the blast.

03:12.801 --> 03:15.717
Most of them delegates here for
the vote.

03:21.418 --> 03:24.204
Come here. Come here.
There you go.

03:26.858 --> 03:28.991
Okay, let's get you out of here.

03:29.731 --> 03:30.949
Wait.

03:35.258 --> 03:37.217
All right now.
Just take it easy, man.

03:37.260 --> 03:39.784
You know,
death ain't what it used to be.

03:39.828 --> 03:41.960
Little help here!

03:46.574 --> 03:48.793
Zombies! Oh my god!

04:16.473 --> 04:17.431
Thanks.

04:17.474 --> 04:18.736
You bet.

04:21.217 --> 04:22.392

walk into Altura.

05:01.388 --> 05:03.215
They look like they were
on vacation.

05:03.259 --> 05:04.521
Little late in the season.

05:05.261 --> 05:07.394
You never see so many
this far north.

05:07.437 --> 05:08.786
These Talkers
are getting twitchy.

05:08.830 --> 05:10.571
We need bizkits.

05:10.832 --> 05:12.442
Where's Dante?

05:14.226 --> 05:17.229
Mr. Stemple?
Hey, Leroy. Can you hear me?

05:17.273 --> 05:19.884
Bizkits are coming. Everything's
cool. Warren, a little help.

05:22.147 --> 05:23.671
We need bizkits!

05:30.504 --> 05:33.724
All right, Mr. Stemple,
here you go. Come on.

05:34.377 --> 05:35.683
That's it.

05:43.299 --> 05:45.606
Wow, these really work.

05:45.649 --> 05:47.085
Like insulin.

05:47.129 --> 05:48.609

Eight thousand two oh five.

Explosion in the Congress Hall.
They think a bomb.

06:29.519 --> 06:30.477
Bomb?

06:31.695 --> 06:32.348
Have you seen Red?

06:32.392 --> 06:33.218
No. Did she find you?

06:33.262 --> 06:35.395
Yes, but then I lost her again.

06:35.438 --> 06:37.614
Where did all these zombies
come from?

06:39.224 --> 06:39.964
I was starting to like it here.

06:43.185 --> 06:44.316
You all right?

06:47.494 --> 06:51.019
Let me know if there's anything
I can do for you, okay?

07:03.510 --> 07:05.990
Who would want to kill
the delegates?

07:07.775 --> 07:10.212
This was an
assassination attempt.

07:10.255 --> 07:11.692
Assassination?

07:12.127 --> 07:13.041
Who

07:13.084 --> 07:14.521
Or you.

07:18.525 --> 07:21.266
But...who?

07:22.311 --> 07:25.880
No, this referendum was gonna
pass. This was gonna work.

07:26.968 --> 07:28.622
Oh, thank god you're all right.

07:29.100 --> 07:31.320
I'm okay. You?

07:31.363 --> 07:34.845
I'm lucky. We lost
so many good people today.

07:35.280 --> 07:37.848
Gained so many Talkers.

07:37.892 --> 07:39.763
Yes, of course.

07:39.807 --> 07:41.548
We're lucky we had
enough bizkits on hand

07:41.591 --> 07:44.464
or we might not have been
able to stop this.

07:44.855 --> 07:47.728
I'm sorry. This is a dark day.

07:50.905 --> 07:52.428
I realize we're still tending to
the wounded,

07:52.472 --> 07:54.125
but this can't wait.

07:54.169 --> 07:58.129
George, my sources are reporting
a Talker may be behind this.

07:58.173 --> 08:01.219
A Talker? No, that doesn't make
any sense.

08:01.263 --> 08:03.091
They had the most to gain.
Look for yourself.

08:03.134 --> 08:04.614
I know. It was a landslide.

08:04.658 --> 08:07.095
The Talkers would have been
full citizens in Newmerica.

08:07.138 --> 08:09.445
This attack changes everything.

08:09.924 --> 08:15.146
It's early in the investigation.
Maybe Dante's heard something?

08:15.190 --> 08:19.716
He wasn't among the wounded.
I don't know where he is.

08:21.936 --> 08:23.981
Something you've got to see.

08:32.903 --> 08:35.166
Anybody else feeling a draft?

08:35.210 --> 08:38.256
Quiet down
and let the doctor work.

08:45.481 --> 08:48.005
Well that's a load off my mind.

08:48.049 --> 08:49.616
What's wrong with you?

08:49.659 --> 08:51.226
This blast is bad news.

08:51.269 --> 08:53.794
On the bright side, we have
fresh test subjects headed our

08:55.970 --> 08:58.581
Maybe it was...a...gas...leak.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.148
Doesn't matter.

09:00.191 --> 09:02.933
Once they call it a terrorist
attack, someone's got to pay.

09:02.977 --> 09:05.240
And how long before they start
blaming the red guy, huh?

09:05.283 --> 09:06.807
Murphy, I know you've been
through a lot...

09:06.850 --> 09:08.896
These people have given me
the hairy eyeball

09:08.939 --> 09:09.810
ever since I got here.

09:09.853 --> 09:11.289
You look like Satan.

09:11.333 --> 09:14.945
Yeah, and I'm rocking it.
But still, it's rude to stare.

09:16.599 --> 09:18.427
What the hell is that?

09:18.688 --> 09:20.429
Lockdown sirens.

09:20.472 --> 09:23.432
Lockdown siren?
And that's my exit.

09:23.475 --> 09:24.607
Murphy, no, wait.

09:24.651 --> 09:26.391
Nope! Bad things happen
to those who wait.

09:26.435 --> 09:28.480
Good luck on your science
experiment, Mister Wizard.

09:28.524 --> 09:30.526
I hope you get an A+.

09:35.662 --> 09:38.708
I feel like I'm having an
out of body experience.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.364
I want a complete perimeter
sweep. Secure this fence.

09:42.407 --> 09:46.368
Then locate and destroy
every zombie that got through.

09:46.411 --> 09:48.109
What did you find?

09:48.152 --> 09:51.721
This is no accident.
This is sabotage. An act of war.

09:54.419 --> 09:57.248
Where's Dante?

09:57.292 --> 09:59.729
What are you asking me?

10:01.862 --> 10:03.254
We have witnesses

10:03.298 --> 10:05.779
that Dante left the hall
just seconds before the blast.

10:05.822 --> 10:08.390
Nobody's been able to find him
since.

10:08.433 --> 10:11.611
We need to bring Dante in
for questioning.

10:31.456 --> 10:33.981
We got to find Dante
before this goes public.

10:34.024 --> 10:36.679
People are rattled. They could
turn on the Talkers and you.

10:36.723 --> 10:39.290
Not these people. I know them.

10:40.335 --> 10:43.686
Dante's wife works in the lab.
Maybe she'll know something.

10:44.252 --> 10:45.253
There she is.

10:45.296 --> 10:46.080
Red!

10:46.558 --> 10:47.951
10K?

10:48.952 --> 10:50.040
Keep moving.

10:51.868 --> 10:53.217
You're shaking.

10:53.522 --> 10:55.524
I'm fine. Really.

10:55.567 --> 10:56.699
You were there, and then...

10:56.743 --> 10:58.222
Zombies.

10:58.266 --> 11:00.442
But we need to talk, for real.

11:00.485 --> 11:01.922
All citizens and militia

11:01.965 --> 11:04.533
are to report back to your posts
for mandatory headcount.

11:04.576 --> 11:06.448
Copy you. Give us a minute.

11:06.491 --> 11:08.145
I have to go.

11:08.189 --> 11:10.800
I'm supposed to report to
Sun Mei's lab in an emergency.

11:10.844 --> 11:12.236
Meet me there when you can.

11:12.280 --> 11:14.935
I will. I promise.

11:25.380 --> 11:27.164
Does that rig of yours record?

11:27.208 --> 11:30.428
Yeah, it backs up to a chip
in the camera.

11:32.082 --> 11:33.431
Oh, right.

11:34.302 --> 11:35.564
The blast could be on here.

11:35.607 --> 11:36.565
Right.

11:39.829 --> 11:42.484
Oh man, I hope it was
turned the right way.

11:43.093 --> 11:46.140
So the bomb
was under the podium.

11:46.618 --> 11:48.925
How far back can you go?

11:48.969 --> 11:50.753
All right, let me,
let me rewind this a bit.

11:50.797 --> 11:53.277
Maybe the guy who planted it
is on here.

11:54.496 --> 11:55.976
Your camera survived?

11:56.019 --> 11:56.716
Yeah, it did.

11:58.021 --> 11:58.718
And I may have inadvertently
captured the guy

11:58.761 --> 12:00.023
who planted the bomb.

12:00.502 --> 12:03.113
I want to have frame
of that video analyzed.

12:03.157 --> 12:05.768
I'm heading up the investigation
personally.

12:05.812 --> 12:07.465
We'll need your camera,
if that's okay?

12:07.509 --> 12:09.119
Why don't you give him a minute?

12:09.163 --> 12:10.991
He might be able to solve it
for you.

12:11.905 --> 12:14.908
People are dead.
There could be more attacks.

12:15.299 --> 12:16.779
So I'm asking you again,

12:16.823 --> 12:20.217
if you will voluntarily
give me that camera.

12:23.481 --> 12:25.440
Yes, of course.

12:26.484 --> 12:31.011
I'll have it back to you
as soon as possible. I promise.

12:31.359 --> 12:32.795
Let's go.

12:39.541 --> 12:41.151
When Murphy told me
you were alive,

12:41.195 --> 12:42.152
I couldn't believe it.

12:42.196 --> 12:44.633
It's so good to see you.

12:44.676 --> 12:46.417
Where's Murphy? Didn't they
bring him here for testing?

12:46.461 --> 12:48.071
Yeah,

12:48.115 --> 12:49.290
but he got nervous and ran away
when the lockdown sirens started

12:49.333 --> 12:50.770
And we should do the same.

12:50.813 --> 12:52.989
Right now we're looking for
Dante.

12:53.033 --> 12:54.686
Have you seen him, Marjorie?

12:54.730 --> 12:59.430
No. Not since this morning.
I'm worried.

12:59.474 --> 13:01.824
He hasn't tried to contact you?

13:03.173 --> 13:06.089
You know you can trust
George and me, right?

13:06.133 --> 13:09.397
Dante is not involved
in any attack.

13:09.440 --> 13:12.530
Newmerica was his dream,
as much as yours.

13:12.574 --> 13:15.316
As long as he's on the run,
it doesn't look good for him

13:15.359 --> 13:17.100
or for Talkers.

13:18.754 --> 13:20.060
In here.

13:20.930 --> 13:21.757
What do you want?!

13:21.801 --> 13:23.063
Seizing your Talkers.

13:23.106 --> 13:25.500
We have orders to take them
to quarantine.

13:25.543 --> 13:27.458
I'm in the middle
of a test cycle.

13:27.502 --> 13:31.811
My orders are to detain
all Talkers. All of them.

13:31.854 --> 13:32.724
Immediately.

13:32.768 --> 13:34.074
On whose authority?

13:34.117 --> 13:37.381
CEO Estes. I'm gonna have to
ask you to step aside.

13:37.425 --> 13:38.643
Get out of my lab.

13:38.687 --> 13:43.648
I have my orders, ma'am.
Now please step aside.

13:49.089 --> 13:51.526
Sun Mei, do what she says.

13:51.569 --> 13:56.792
She's right. We'll talk to Estes
We'll get you out of there.

13:57.097 --> 13:58.968
Find Dante.

13:59.577 --> 14:01.188
We will.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.151
We'll be back
for your guinea pigs.

14:13.026 --> 14:15.985
I thought they'd never leave.

14:16.507 --> 14:17.117
God.

14:21.948 --> 14:24.559
Hold it. Don't move.

14:26.256 --> 14:28.084
You're red.

14:29.129 --> 14:30.652
And?

14:30.695 --> 14:33.220
I'm gonna need a pulse.

14:33.873 --> 14:38.703
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Yeah.
One red hot pulse coming up.

14:42.533 --> 14:46.059

democracy.

15:11.998 --> 15:13.695
Altura CEO Roman Estes

15:13.738 --> 15:17.655
has asked to update citizens on
the status of the investigation.

those who lost their lives

15:36.109 --> 15:37.414
Good evening,

15:39.025 --> 15:42.028
fellow citizens of Altura and
throughout all the outposts.

15:42.071 --> 15:46.423
Today was to have been a day of
joy, unity, and progress,

15:46.467 --> 15:49.774
not a day of death, fear,
and pain.

15:51.037 --> 15:54.997
I confess
this tragedy is my fault.

15:56.477 --> 16:01.525
Like many of us, I was taken by
the momentum of change.

16:01.569 --> 16:05.138
We failed you, but we
won't let our guard down again.

16:05.747 --> 16:06.661
As such,

16:08.228 --> 16:11.405
I've ordered a full lockdown
of Altura until further notice.

16:11.448 --> 16:15.191
We ask for your
patience in restoring order.

16:15.235 --> 16:18.890
Information has come to light
during our investigation

16:18.934 --> 16:21.589
that has resulted in us
identifying a person of interest

16:21.632 --> 16:23.025
who we wish to speak to

16:23.069 --> 16:25.027
in connection with
today's explosion.

16:25.071 --> 16:27.377
Don't rush to judgment, Estes.

16:27.421 --> 16:29.031
Altura authorities are asking

16:29.075 --> 16:32.730
Joseph Dante to turn himself in
for questioning.

16:32.774 --> 16:34.776
If you know the whereabouts
of Dante,

16:34.819 --> 16:39.172
do not contact him yourself.
Contact authorities immediately.

16:39.911 --> 16:43.524
Until the bombers
are brought to justice,

16:43.567 --> 16:47.006
I am calling for the quarantine
of all Talkers inside

16:47.049 --> 16:48.616
the gates of Altura.

16:51.401 --> 16:53.403
I know that sounds cruel.

16:53.447 --> 16:56.015
These are our family.
Our friends.

16:57.451 --> 16:58.800
This is for their safety

16:58.843 --> 17:01.629
and for the safety
of all Altura citizens.

17:01.672 --> 17:02.934
And there it is.

17:02.978 --> 17:04.240
God. What is he doing?

17:04.284 --> 17:06.808
We've had to make
difficult choices before.

17:06.851 --> 17:08.418
That's how we survived.

17:08.462 --> 17:11.508
Thank you for your cooperation
during this difficult time.

17:11.552 --> 17:14.076
We will restore security.

17:14.120 --> 17:16.600
Without that,
democracy is meaningless.

17:17.732 --> 17:19.081
I need to talk to him.

17:19.125 --> 17:23.520
Hey, hey. Not now.
Let's get out of here first.

17:31.572 --> 17:33.487
Where would Dante go?
We need to know what he knows.

17:33.530 --> 17:35.184
This is a waking nightmare.

17:35.228 --> 17:37.056
And it's not over yet.

17:37.099 --> 17:38.274
Stop that van!

17:56.423 --> 17:57.989
Someone's coming!

17:59.121 --> 17:59.948
He's not stopping!

17:59.991 --> 18:01.558
He's gonna crash the gate.

18:01.602 --> 18:02.603
Open it! Open the gate!

18:02.646 --> 18:04.039
10K, go! Now!

18:10.480 --> 18:11.351
Open fire!

18:12.743 --> 18:13.309
It's jammed!

18:13.353 --> 18:14.310
Forget it!

18:24.407 --> 18:27.106
Dante? Wait! Stop!

18:28.846 --> 18:30.283
Why would he run?

18:30.326 --> 18:32.850
And what the hell
is Murphy doing?

18:32.894 --> 18:35.897
Defend the gate until
someone gets here to fix it.

19:08.930 --> 19:11.193
Thanks for the lift.

19:17.895 --> 19:19.462
Do you hear that?

19:23.118 --> 19:27.427
There's hate in the air,
and it makes me feel so...

19:27.470 --> 19:30.343
Alive isn't the right word.

19:31.082 --> 19:33.215
Aroused.

19:34.477 --> 19:36.349
Humans.

19:36.697 --> 19:40.614
Why are the living
so damn predictable?

19:41.223 --> 19:43.094
Estes will listen to me.

19:43.138 --> 19:45.575
He'll see this quarantine
isn't gonna make us safer.

19:45.619 --> 19:47.011
It's gonna drive the Talkers
underground

19:47.055 --> 19:48.230
and cut them off
from their bizkits.

19:48.274 --> 19:49.536
It's already happening.

19:49.579 --> 19:50.276
Hey!

19:50.319 --> 19:51.538
I'm gonna kick your...

19:52.365 --> 19:55.063
Go on. Get out of here.
Leroy, are you all right?

19:55.455 --> 20:00.503
Doesn't hurt. I can't feel
anything. Not used to that yet.

20:00.547 --> 20:02.679
Hang in there.
This mess will be over soon.

20:02.723 --> 20:04.681
This is all your fault.

20:05.682 --> 20:08.337
You said they were
just like us, only dead.

20:08.381 --> 20:10.209
Now they want our brains.

20:10.557 --> 20:12.733
Well just let them try.

20:13.299 --> 20:15.736
I'll kill them all.
I swear I will.

20:15.779 --> 20:17.216
I don't want your brains.

20:17.259 --> 20:18.913
Somebody gonna get
an ass whoopin

20:18.956 --> 20:20.306
if you don't stop talking.

20:21.742 --> 20:24.048
No, no, no. Let him go.

20:24.092 --> 20:25.572
What?

20:26.094 --> 20:28.401
Let him go.

20:31.752 --> 20:36.496
Go home. Get out of here.
Your family needs you.

20:45.287 --> 20:47.158
Why'd we let him go?

20:47.202 --> 20:49.726
I recognized him.

20:49.770 --> 20:53.252
His brother was one of
the delegates killed today.

20:55.645 --> 20:56.516
Damn.

20:56.559 --> 20:58.039
Come on, man. We need bizkits.

20:58.082 --> 21:00.607
Hey, we're dying in here.
Get us some bizkits.

21:00.650 --> 21:01.172
Marjorie.

21:01.216 --> 21:02.391
Sun Mei.

21:02.435 --> 21:03.218
Marjorie.

21:03.262 --> 21:04.611
Thank god you're here.

21:04.654 --> 21:06.787
This is the fourth detention
area that I've checked.

21:06.830 --> 21:09.311
They couldn't tell me where
you were. Are you okay?

21:09.355 --> 21:11.095
I'm fine.

21:11.400 --> 21:12.749
Do you need anything?

21:12.793 --> 21:16.579
We need bizkits.
They aren't feeding us.

21:18.625 --> 21:19.843
Why aren't you feeding
the Talkers?

21:19.887 --> 21:21.802
No bizkits. They're all gone.

21:24.805 --> 21:26.937
These bucket heads
don't know anything.

21:26.981 --> 21:28.417
I need to find Estes.

21:28.461 --> 21:32.508
We need to find bizkits.
These Talkers are going to turn.

21:33.117 --> 21:35.337
We'll be back soon, okay?

21:44.999 --> 21:47.262
All right, right there
where it was repaired.

21:47.306 --> 21:48.307
Got it.

21:56.402 --> 21:58.795
Somebody's coming.
Stop right there!

22:00.623 --> 22:02.582
What's going on?
Why aren't you at your post?

22:02.625 --> 22:05.236
We caught them at the fence.

22:05.280 --> 22:07.413
Get away from there.
I told you it needed to...

22:09.806 --> 22:10.720
Was that necessary?

22:10.764 --> 22:12.026
Probably.

22:13.157 --> 22:15.856
Doc and CZ,
we're taking George to Pacifica.

22:15.899 --> 22:18.162
10K, you and Sarge
find Sun Mei and Red,

22:18.206 --> 22:21.383
and you join us as soon as you
can. We're gonna need you.

22:21.427 --> 22:22.297
Here, take this.

22:22.341 --> 22:23.211
Ready?

23:57.697 --> 23:59.350
Here, Talker Talker.

24:00.351 --> 24:02.397
Here we go, boys.

24:03.354 --> 24:04.965
Free lunch.

24:06.401 --> 24:07.794
Hey, Talkers.

24:12.842 --> 24:14.278
That's close enough.

24:14.583 --> 24:17.456
Your life depends
on the next decision you make.

24:26.900 --> 24:28.641
Ah, crap.

24:28.684 --> 24:30.381
We'll take those weapons.

24:35.604 --> 24:39.216
Hey, guys. Don't leave us
out here like this.

24:41.392 --> 24:43.569
Be thankful we don't mercy you.

24:46.397 --> 24:48.791
We'll leave these
just up the road.

24:50.227 --> 24:52.969
And just to prove we're not
all bad,

24:53.013 --> 24:56.495
here's a sock for each of you.
Catch.

24:58.671 --> 25:00.020
Let's go!

25:21.476 --> 25:23.173
Shit.

26:11.526 --> 26:12.527
What do you want?!

26:12.571 --> 26:17.227
Stop! I mean it! Who are you?!

26:23.538 --> 26:27.324
Wesson?
Is that really you?

26:27.368 --> 26:30.240
It's been a long time
since Murphytown, sir.

26:30.284 --> 26:32.329
What the hell
is wrong with you?!

26:32.373 --> 26:34.462
You scared the life
out of me!

26:34.941 --> 26:38.292
Good one.
We missed you, sir.

26:39.075 --> 26:39.989
We?

26:40.511 --> 26:43.123
We're a dozen blends strong,
sir.

26:43.558 --> 26:45.691
We've been waiting
for your return.

26:52.828 --> 26:54.743
Somebody's taken
all the bizkits.

26:54.787 --> 26:56.615
Marjorie keeps a stash
somewhere.

26:56.658 --> 26:59.487
Hi, Red. Where's Margie?
What are you guys...

26:59.530 --> 27:00.836
Where does Marjorie
keep bizkits?

27:00.880 --> 27:02.490
Underneath the microscopes
behind me.

27:03.056 --> 27:05.624
I have one
in my pocket too.

27:07.495 --> 27:08.627
Thanks.

27:09.932 --> 27:10.716
That should hold you over
till we get back.

27:10.759 --> 27:12.761
Delicious. I really love those.

27:12.805 --> 27:14.197
You can taste the brains
in every bite.

27:14.241 --> 27:15.024
Stay here.

27:15.068 --> 27:15.851
Okee dokee.

27:17.070 --> 27:17.723
Warren says we have to get out
of Altura.

27:17.766 --> 27:18.898
Like five minutes ago.

27:18.941 --> 27:20.247
I have a detention pen
full of Talkers

27:20.290 --> 27:22.597
who will melt down
without these bizkits.

27:22.641 --> 27:25.731
I'll go with Sun Mei. We'll
meet at the cut in the fence.

27:30.344 --> 27:31.693
Hi.

27:32.912 --> 27:34.130
Hi.

27:34.174 --> 27:37.220
So, you gonna introduce me
to your friend?

27:37.264 --> 27:40.528
Let's go someplace we can talk.
Alone.

27:41.790 --> 27:43.444
I can take a hint.

27:44.663 --> 27:48.318
Dante has escaped with two,
possibly three Talkers.

27:48.362 --> 27:50.233
He was driving the van
that crashed the gate.

27:50.277 --> 27:51.582
I assumed as much.

27:52.061 --> 27:53.584
We sent a patrol after them.

27:53.628 --> 27:55.064
And the Talkers?

27:55.456 --> 28:00.200
Almost fully contained.
Just tracking down the last few.

28:03.725 --> 28:05.640
And George?

28:07.729 --> 28:11.080
She appears to have left Altura
with a group of new arrivals.

28:12.342 --> 28:14.170
Well, keep trying to locate
them.

28:14.214 --> 28:16.129
They may be headed back
to Pacifica.

28:16.172 --> 28:18.566
If they are, we will find them.

28:25.791 --> 28:28.097
You can leave finding Dante
to me.

28:28.402 --> 28:30.926
He couldn't have gotten
that far.

28:48.683 --> 28:51.599
You make me feel
so alive.

29:05.004 --> 29:07.267
When I saw you in Altura,
I knew that was you.

29:07.310 --> 29:08.964
We've been really busy
in your absence, sir.

29:09.008 --> 29:10.183
I think you'll be pleased.

29:10.226 --> 29:14.753
Yes, well, let's not get
carried away...yet.

29:15.492 --> 29:16.493
Car!

29:25.241 --> 29:27.330
Get down,
get down, get down.

29:32.596 --> 29:33.728
What are you...
What are you doing?

29:33.772 --> 29:35.686
Don't be afraid, sir.

29:39.865 --> 29:40.909
What is this?

29:41.997 --> 29:43.477
You're all blends?

29:44.957 --> 29:46.088
Carpool.

29:46.132 --> 29:46.654
Carpool?

29:46.697 --> 29:47.394
Yeah.

29:47.437 --> 29:48.699
We all work together.

29:48.743 --> 29:50.353
Work?

29:50.397 --> 29:51.311
Where?

29:52.007 --> 29:53.052
Limbo.

29:53.095 --> 29:53.704
Limbo?

29:53.748 --> 29:54.967
Yes, sir.

29:55.010 --> 29:57.665
And I think you'll like it there
too.

30:10.069 --> 30:11.984
I can't believe
this is happening.

30:13.115 --> 30:14.551
Nothing good lasts.

30:14.595 --> 30:16.727
I hope you're wrong about that.

30:18.686 --> 30:22.733
I didn't know if you were dead
or turned or what happened.

30:22.777 --> 30:24.170
You were just gone.

30:29.001 --> 30:32.221
I didn't know
if I'd ever see you again.

30:32.265 --> 30:35.834
I checked every truckload
of new arrivals.

30:35.877 --> 30:40.795
I was so afraid I'd lost you
forever.

30:40.839 --> 30:43.711
I never stopped
thinking about you.

30:57.464 --> 31:00.859
I have to ask you...

31:02.469 --> 31:06.908
about you...and Sarge.

31:08.214 --> 31:09.389
Yeah?

31:10.346 --> 31:12.000
You seem so...

31:13.523 --> 31:15.047
connected.

31:17.005 --> 31:18.354
Yeah.

31:19.921 --> 31:23.316
But I mean it's different.
It's not like it is with you.

31:23.359 --> 31:26.014
Is that how she feels?

31:34.066 --> 31:36.938
I've known Dante
since the Black Rain.

31:36.982 --> 31:39.114
He'd risk his post-life
for any of us.

31:39.636 --> 31:44.424
Dante will go to Pacifica.
He'll have an explanation.

31:45.729 --> 31:49.908
Estes and his Talker round-up
is only making things worse.

31:49.951 --> 31:52.084
Estes is trying to
protect everyone,

31:52.127 --> 31:54.173
but it's so wrong headed.

31:55.261 --> 31:57.350
It's not like him.

32:11.494 --> 32:14.019
Is that Dante's van?

32:28.729 --> 32:30.861
Nobody's home.

32:31.601 --> 32:33.212
What's that smell?

32:33.255 --> 32:34.865
Over here.

32:43.135 --> 32:45.180
Oh my god.

33:03.503 --> 33:05.244
This is just getting started.

33:05.287 --> 33:07.724
We don't deserve a planet.

33:08.073 --> 33:09.422
Is Dante here?

33:09.683 --> 33:12.207
No. He must have escaped.

33:12.251 --> 33:13.904
Or been taken prisoner.

33:14.731 --> 33:16.777
We got a live one here.

33:19.040 --> 33:20.737
There we go.

33:21.695 --> 33:23.610
Who did this to you?

33:23.653 --> 33:24.959
Carlos.

33:25.481 --> 33:29.268
Carlos. Carlos, is Dante here?

33:31.226 --> 33:34.577
Blink once for yes
or twice for no.

33:37.798 --> 33:40.279
Were you headed to Pacifica?

33:41.497 --> 33:44.239
Did Altura Militia do this?

33:48.200 --> 33:52.726
They were tortured. Whoever
did this wanted information.

33:56.686 --> 33:59.820
I don't understand, Carlos.
I'm sorry.

34:00.734 --> 34:02.170
Let me.

34:10.352 --> 34:11.310
Mercy.

34:17.055 --> 34:18.708
I give you mercy.

34:39.903 --> 34:43.255
Marjorie. Marjorie.
Marjorie. Marjorie.

34:43.298 --> 34:45.083
Marjorie. Marjorie.

34:46.475 --> 34:47.868
Come here.

34:47.911 --> 34:49.696
Come on. Come on.

34:51.828 --> 34:55.093
Here, here. This is for you.
Here.

34:57.834 --> 34:59.662
Feeling better?

34:59.706 --> 35:00.228
Yes.

35:04.580 --> 35:05.973
You there! Get away from him!

35:06.016 --> 35:07.322
They're starving! Can't you see
they need bizkits?

35:07.366 --> 35:08.062
You're making them crazy!

35:08.106 --> 35:09.063
Hands off her, soldier!

35:09.107 --> 35:10.151
Let him go!

35:10.760 --> 35:11.239
Hey!

35:15.287 --> 35:16.984
No!

35:22.685 --> 35:24.992
Get out of here. Find Dante.

35:36.090 --> 35:37.526
Almost there.

35:37.570 --> 35:39.615
What about Sarge and Sun Mei?

35:39.659 --> 35:42.966
You worry about Sarge
a lot.

35:44.054 --> 35:45.621
See. It's all good.

35:48.711 --> 35:50.713
Go on. I'll be right there.

35:50.757 --> 35:54.456
[screaming and growling
continue]

35:54.500 --> 35:55.370
Hey!

35:57.938 --> 35:59.026
Get out of here!

36:12.822 --> 36:13.997
I'm not going.

36:14.041 --> 36:14.824
Sun Mei.

36:14.868 --> 36:16.348
My work is too important.

36:16.391 --> 36:19.264
I'm so close to a breakthrough.
I need the lab.

36:20.656 --> 36:21.657
10K.10K.

36:28.098 --> 36:29.752
Help 10K. I'll get the Zs.

36:29.796 --> 36:30.362
10K!

37:03.830 --> 37:05.310
Help! Sarge!

37:08.008 --> 37:08.922
Behind you!

37:08.965 --> 37:11.490
I got it! Help 10K!

37:58.972 --> 38:00.669
10K! Go!

38:04.934 --> 38:06.719
Sarge! No!

39:33.109 --> 39:34.676
I'm sorry, 10K.

39:35.460 --> 39:37.853
There was no other
way.

39:37.897 --> 39:40.421
I couldn't lose you
like that. I had to do it.

39:40.465 --> 39:43.250
There was...
there was no other way.

39:43.293 --> 39:47.167
Sarge is a hero.
She saved both of your lives.

39:49.256 --> 39:51.780
I'll be right back.

39:52.738 --> 39:53.652
The cut was clean.

39:54.783 --> 39:56.263
But we need to keep
a close eye on him.

39:56.306 --> 39:57.264
What do I say to him?

39:57.307 --> 39:59.397
You saved his life.

40:00.267 --> 40:02.051
I'll be right back.

40:21.636 --> 40:24.552
Who would do something
so terrible?

40:24.596 --> 40:26.815
I've met a few humans.

40:27.468 --> 40:30.819
And Talkers are just
human enough.

40:31.951 --> 40:36.390
Did Dante escape?
Or was he taken prisoner?

40:37.696 --> 40:40.394
Or what if Estes was right?

40:42.222 --> 40:44.529
What if Dante
was somehow behind the blast?

40:45.138 --> 40:49.447
What if he changed?
Became more zombie...

40:51.797 --> 40:53.451
And I missed it?

40:55.191 --> 41:00.109
No, no. Your belief in him came
from your gut, not your head.

41:00.153 --> 41:02.024
Always go with your gut.

41:02.068 --> 41:06.028
We were so close to having this
whole thing come together.

41:06.072 --> 41:08.378
So close.

41:10.511 --> 41:13.601
There's still time
to put it all together.

41:20.565 --> 41:22.697
But there's not that much time
left.

41:36.406 --> 41:38.539
Puppies and kittens.

41:38.583 --> 41:41.716
Puppies and kittens.
