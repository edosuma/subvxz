00:02.836 --> 00:04.546
Hello. Is somebody out there?

00:12.846 --> 00:13.847
John!

00:14.431 --> 00:15.432
John!

00:27.069 --> 00:28.278
John, stop!

00:46.213 --> 00:48.841
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

00:48.924 --> 00:51.343
-It's okay. Stop saying that.
-I'm sorry.

00:51.426 --> 00:53.011
Stop saying that. Stop.

00:53.095 --> 00:54.304
You're all right.

00:57.558 --> 00:58.892
I'm not all right.

01:01.103 --> 01:02.855
Thank you so much for coming.

01:06.191 --> 01:08.277
-That's the last of 'em, huh?
-Yep.

01:08.360 --> 01:09.403
Yeah.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.823
Surprised everybody
heading home to bed early.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.741
Well, you know, people have jobs to do.

01:14.825 --> 01:15.993
On a Sunday?

01:17.160 --> 01:18.328
What do you want, Danny?

01:18.412 --> 01:20.998
You throw this at me last minute,
rustle up a party for you.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.584
I did my best. I'm sorry
it wasn't fucking Woodstock, man.

01:23.667 --> 01:27.171
It's all right. It was a swell party,
all right? Don't sweat it.

01:28.255 --> 01:31.675
You know,
there is a lot of pressure on me.

01:31.758 --> 01:32.759
I--

01:32.843 --> 01:35.012
You write one book, you make one video,

01:35.095 --> 01:38.849
and right away, they're like, bam,
they're on you for the next one.

01:38.932 --> 01:41.476
"You better hustle,
before somebody comes along and--"

01:41.560 --> 01:43.061
Beats you to the punch?

01:45.397 --> 01:46.648
You want a drink?

01:48.567 --> 01:50.777
Yeah. What do you got?

01:52.029 --> 01:54.323
Forty-year-old Macallan.

01:55.574 --> 01:56.575
All right.

02:04.583 --> 02:06.710
Unless that's
too capitalist elitist of me.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.878
I had to save the good stuff
until the crowd leaves.

02:08.961 --> 02:10.923
-Isn't that what you said?
-Yeah. Here we go.

02:11.006 --> 02:13.800
-What am I? As bad as Reagan?
-Worse than Reagan.

02:13.884 --> 02:15.594
Worse than Reagan. That's right.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.723
-Here we-- Yeah, no. Really.
-Really?

02:20.682 --> 02:21.892
Here, just take it.

02:24.937 --> 02:27.314
You were always better
at dishing it out than taking it,

02:27.397 --> 02:28.565
you know that?

02:31.360 --> 02:32.361
I know.

02:37.574 --> 02:39.576
You've got a pretty good setup here.

02:41.411 --> 02:42.538
Yeah.

02:42.621 --> 02:44.873
I'm gonna say it
because it needs to be said,

02:44.957 --> 02:48.669
but I think you should lay off yourself
and enjoy it.

02:49.586 --> 02:53.298
I can't. It's just--
It's not the way I'm built.

02:53.382 --> 02:55.968
And besides, I'm jealous of what you have,
you know that.

02:56.051 --> 03:00.264
-Do not start with that shit.
-Why not? It's true.

03:00.347 --> 03:03.642
You are perched up here
on Mount Hollywood,

03:03.725 --> 03:06.520
and you are somehow envious
of my charming adherence

03:06.603 --> 03:08.230
to the ideology of our youth.

03:12.901 --> 03:14.069
She picked you.

03:15.654 --> 03:18.282
At the end of the day, she picked you, so…

03:20.367 --> 03:22.411
Babe, are you coming to bed?

03:22.494 --> 03:24.788
Honey, I will be right there.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.540
I miss you.

03:28.876 --> 03:31.795
-She is just so horny.
-Yeah.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.338
I can't keep up with it.

03:34.298 --> 03:36.592
And the noises she makes,
it's like an animal.

03:36.675 --> 03:39.052
Yeah, we had front-row seats last night.

03:39.136 --> 03:41.346
-You heard that?
-All of it. Yeah.

03:41.430 --> 03:43.515
Fucking open-plan house.

03:43.599 --> 03:44.600
Hon?

03:44.683 --> 03:46.602
Honey, I said I'd be right there, okay?

03:46.685 --> 03:50.147
I gotta finish my drink,
I've gotta do my rounds, set the alarm.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.815
-Come on.
-The alarm?

03:51.899 --> 03:53.901
You have a burglar alarm
up here in paradise?

03:53.984 --> 03:56.278
Yeah, everybody in the canyon does.
You know, after Manson.

03:56.361 --> 03:57.613
-Right.
-It's that or a shotgun.

03:57.696 --> 03:58.947
She won't let me get a shotgun--

03:59.031 --> 04:00.949
You can't set the alarm.
Sheila's not back yet.

04:01.033 --> 04:03.452
What? She's not in the bedroom, sleeping?

04:03.535 --> 04:06.288
-No, she left. Your car's gone.
-What?

04:12.836 --> 04:14.213
Are you well?

04:16.089 --> 04:17.673
You look well, still.

04:18.634 --> 04:20.802
And you look skinny, still.

04:20.886 --> 04:23.764
I'm well. A little tired.

04:23.847 --> 04:26.099
Maya's four now, so she's very active.

04:26.683 --> 04:29.061
And are you going to try for another one?

04:29.937 --> 04:32.731
Or does that not go along
with your lifestyle?

04:32.814 --> 04:34.983
All right, dear, just--

04:35.817 --> 04:39.446
Did you bring a photo for us to see,
at least?

04:39.530 --> 04:43.450
Yes, I should have something in my purse.
It might be a little dated.

04:54.378 --> 04:58.465
She's darling. Just darling. Yes.

04:58.549 --> 04:59.925
And those cheeks.

05:00.592 --> 05:01.885
And those eyes.

05:01.969 --> 05:04.763
You know, I knitted a hat for her.

05:04.847 --> 05:08.934
Of course,
it's probably way too small by now.

05:09.017 --> 05:11.103
Yeah, she does have a big head.

05:11.186 --> 05:12.813
Isn't she sweet here?

05:14.106 --> 05:15.107
A beaut.

05:17.067 --> 05:19.570
I know how angry you've been,

05:19.653 --> 05:23.365
but if we could just meet her, to just--
even for an afternoon,

05:23.448 --> 05:25.367
it would mean the world to me.

05:25.450 --> 05:27.244
You know she won't allow it.

05:27.327 --> 05:30.163
She's made that clear over the years,
and we have to accept it.

05:30.247 --> 05:31.415
All right, but she's here.

05:31.498 --> 05:33.375
I mean, she had to come here for a reason?

05:33.458 --> 05:35.669
We both know what the reason is.

05:36.670 --> 05:37.671
Don't we?

05:40.340 --> 05:42.676
Things-- Yeah, they haven't been great…

05:44.094 --> 05:45.554
financially speaking.

05:46.221 --> 05:47.222
How so?

05:50.475 --> 05:51.894
We could use some support.

05:54.521 --> 05:55.898
Danny's not a bad person.

05:55.981 --> 05:57.983
-We never thought so.
-One, two, three.

05:58.066 --> 06:01.195
He's just naive.
We know it's charming, but it's unstable.

06:01.278 --> 06:03.030
-One, two, three.
-All right. Enough, dear.

06:03.113 --> 06:04.823
How much support do you need?

06:04.907 --> 06:07.117
-One, two, three.
-Yes.

06:07.201 --> 06:08.327
How much will it take?

06:09.620 --> 06:11.330
Don't back down. Don't you dare.

06:11.413 --> 06:12.956
$5,000.

06:13.540 --> 06:14.791
That's an awful lot of money.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.835
That you have
sitting in your savings account.

06:16.919 --> 06:19.755
We will discuss it, won't we, Vaughn?
And let you know.

06:19.838 --> 06:22.716
It has to be tonight
or you won't get to meet your grandchild.

06:24.718 --> 06:27.179
Don't-- Don't…

06:34.436 --> 06:36.146
Are they still doing it?

06:36.647 --> 06:39.441
Can she still get what she wants
by taking it away?

06:43.362 --> 06:45.781
There you go, Mom. There you go.

06:53.539 --> 06:55.123
-Thank you.
-It's all right.

06:55.207 --> 06:56.208
No, it's not.

07:00.504 --> 07:04.341
It's kind of you… to take care of me.

07:04.424 --> 07:05.884
To take care of all of us.

07:08.804 --> 07:11.723
Can you tell me what happened?

07:11.807 --> 07:14.434
I just wanted to go for a swim.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.938
Got in a little trouble, that's all.

07:19.648 --> 07:20.649
Okay.

07:23.110 --> 07:26.363
But you can't. Swim, that is.

07:26.446 --> 07:27.614
That isn't true.

07:28.699 --> 07:30.534
I don't often…

07:31.577 --> 07:34.705
but it isn't true
that I can't necessarily.

07:35.706 --> 07:37.541
Okay, I thought that…

07:39.751 --> 07:40.961
But that's okay.

07:43.839 --> 07:47.676
But you can't swim well, John.
If I hadn't heard you out there--

07:47.759 --> 07:52.556
I used to as a child
in the lake by the cottage.

07:55.559 --> 07:58.312
It's big enough
that there's a strong current.

08:00.731 --> 08:02.608
My brothers and I, we used to race.

08:02.691 --> 08:06.069
I still remember that feeling
of getting to the middle.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.155
Point of no return.

08:08.238 --> 08:12.242
Where going back
was just as hard as going forward.

08:13.785 --> 08:15.037
I would keep going.

08:16.455 --> 08:17.581
And I would win.

08:21.668 --> 08:25.005
God was with me back then.

08:25.631 --> 08:27.257
He's still with you.

08:27.841 --> 08:31.011
Look at all we have together,
all our blessings.

08:31.094 --> 08:32.971
I feel that way most of the time.

08:34.139 --> 08:35.140
I do.

08:37.643 --> 08:38.936
But not all the time.

08:40.062 --> 08:44.358
There is so much on your mind
with the election, the development.

08:44.441 --> 08:47.569
Let's get a good night's sleep,
and in the morning, it will feel better.

08:49.238 --> 08:50.322
I'm unhappy.

09:01.542 --> 09:02.543
Wow. Seriously?

09:02.626 --> 09:06.129
You're not gonna call that?
That's not a foul anymore? Come on.

09:09.341 --> 09:10.425
Come on.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.263
Hey, Ernie, what are you watching?

09:14.847 --> 09:16.473
It's soccer.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.937
One of your European games?

09:23.647 --> 09:25.566
Must be. It's the middle of the night.

09:27.609 --> 09:31.947
I said is it one of your European games?

09:33.073 --> 09:34.741
Yes. Italy.

09:38.537 --> 09:40.414
I just wanted to be answered.

09:41.123 --> 09:43.417
It's hurtful to ask a question
and not get an answer.

09:43.500 --> 09:46.461
I'm sorry. It's a big qualifying match.

09:46.545 --> 09:48.463
It's fine. I don't care what you watch.

09:48.547 --> 09:51.300
I just want you to communicate with me.

09:51.383 --> 09:52.718
-I'm your wife.
-From the corner.

09:52.801 --> 09:55.345
Yeah, pass, pass, pass.
Yes. Yes. Get it for us.

09:55.429 --> 09:58.849
Pass, pass, pass. Come on!
You're right in front of--

09:59.433 --> 10:01.268
What did-- What you do that for?

10:04.980 --> 10:10.152
Do you remember
when we looked at this house?

10:10.235 --> 10:13.655
And we both had our moment
when we knew it was ours, right?

10:13.739 --> 10:15.490
Like, for me, it was that kitchen.

10:16.825 --> 10:19.036
All that space to prep and cook.

10:19.536 --> 10:22.372
And for you, it was this basement.

10:23.123 --> 10:25.459
All this privacy to what?

10:27.586 --> 10:29.046
To what, Ernie?

10:29.129 --> 10:32.758
To watch games.

10:33.926 --> 10:36.762
-Is that all?
-Can I please have my remote back?

10:41.016 --> 10:44.520
What the hell are you doing?
What are you--

10:52.903 --> 10:56.406
What happened to-- Who did that?

10:58.242 --> 10:59.243
I did it.

11:06.208 --> 11:07.292
Hey, man.

11:07.918 --> 11:10.420
It's Bunny. Again.

11:11.630 --> 11:12.965
You heard from Tyler at all?

11:14.466 --> 11:16.468
Yeah, yeah, I'm calling again.

11:17.594 --> 11:21.598
Because I still don't have
a fucking answer or a fucking boyfriend.

11:23.392 --> 11:26.019
Yeah, okay. Well, you know what?

11:26.562 --> 11:28.522
You're a fucking mental case as well.

11:28.605 --> 11:31.608
Dude, you need to take
a fucking bucket of chill pills.

11:31.692 --> 11:33.569
And so does your fucking mother!

11:35.571 --> 11:37.406
Call me if you hear anything, please.

11:54.923 --> 11:56.049
You need something there?

11:56.133 --> 11:57.342
No.

11:58.177 --> 12:00.429
It sure looks like you need some help.

12:00.512 --> 12:02.139
Well, guess what, fuckface? I don't.

12:10.689 --> 12:12.357
My boyfriend fucking flaked on me.

12:14.526 --> 12:17.154
Sorry to hear that. The guy must be crazy.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.324
Yeah, well, that's how it goes, right?

12:21.867 --> 12:23.577
And then I can't call anyone anymore

12:23.660 --> 12:25.996
because I threw my fucking change
in the sand.

12:26.580 --> 12:27.581
Well, don't give up.

12:28.457 --> 12:31.627
I actually have a metal detector
in my truck I can grab.

12:31.710 --> 12:33.921
You'd be amazed
what I can find with that thing.

12:34.505 --> 12:38.050
Diamond rings and gold teeth.

12:38.133 --> 12:41.094
Even found a bike once. I still ride it.

12:42.262 --> 12:45.641
What's the point? It's gone.

12:47.059 --> 12:49.645
Like Tyler. Like everything.

12:49.728 --> 12:51.104
It doesn't have to be that way.

12:51.188 --> 12:55.317
Pretty girl like you,
you should be waited on, hand and foot.

12:56.652 --> 12:57.778
Like a queen.

12:57.861 --> 13:00.197
I don't even want that.

13:00.739 --> 13:02.366
I can take care of myself.

13:02.950 --> 13:04.868
I have since I was 18.

13:04.952 --> 13:07.079
Then I met this cute guy,

13:07.162 --> 13:09.915
and all of a sudden,
I think I should trust somebody.

13:09.998 --> 13:13.043
That's my bad. That's on me.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.838
I can't trust anybody in this world.

13:15.921 --> 13:19.007
-Bam. I got one.
-Me too.

13:19.883 --> 13:20.884
See that?

13:21.468 --> 13:22.553
Yes, I do.

13:24.513 --> 13:26.098
You see this?

13:26.181 --> 13:27.432
Stick around, stick around.

13:30.727 --> 13:32.271
Oh, God.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.774
Man, I think I love you.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.695
They wanna do it, okay?
They-- All of them.

13:40.529 --> 13:42.239
They're not forced. They all agree.

13:43.240 --> 13:44.700
I insist on that.

13:44.783 --> 13:46.326
So, that's what you like?

13:46.869 --> 13:47.870
Why?

13:48.954 --> 13:52.082
I don't know. I just do.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.543
It's weird and it's embarrassing.

13:54.626 --> 13:59.548
And I just like it.
I really-- I always have.

13:59.631 --> 14:01.508
But I kept it private.

14:01.592 --> 14:07.389
And you violated my privacy,
and you had no right to do that.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.602
I'm so sorry.

14:13.228 --> 14:14.980
Oh, my God.
This wasn't fair to you at all.

14:15.063 --> 14:17.524
-I'm so sorry.
-Damn it, Greta, don't do that.

14:17.608 --> 14:20.194
-Don't back down so easy.
-I'm sorry.

14:20.277 --> 14:23.906
-You did it again.
-Oh, my God. Fine! I'm mad.

14:23.989 --> 14:25.657
I'm mad at you.

14:26.450 --> 14:29.077
You kept things from me.

14:29.161 --> 14:30.871
You made me scared.

14:30.954 --> 14:32.497
Why did you do that?

14:33.081 --> 14:34.958
-To protect you.
-From what?

14:35.542 --> 14:36.543
From me.

14:37.920 --> 14:39.505
That I'm-- That I'm--

14:41.131 --> 14:44.009
That I'm a monster and a sicko
and a pervert and a freak.

14:44.801 --> 14:50.307
We are all sickos. Inside, anyway.
Every single one of us.

15:14.164 --> 15:15.165
I am…

15:16.416 --> 15:17.417
What?

15:19.670 --> 15:21.171
You're what? Say what you are.

15:23.549 --> 15:27.511
Ernie, you have to say it to me
from now on,

15:27.594 --> 15:28.679
whatever it is.

15:32.057 --> 15:35.477
I'm so turned on.

15:42.776 --> 15:44.069
That's right, you are.

15:44.152 --> 15:45.487
-Yeah.
-I am.

16:09.469 --> 16:10.971
-Where am I?
-Hey, hey.

16:11.054 --> 16:12.181
You're in LA.

16:12.764 --> 16:15.309
Remember? We took a fundraising trip.

16:15.392 --> 16:16.435
Yeah.

16:17.811 --> 16:19.396
I just had the craziest dream.

16:21.064 --> 16:24.109
There was a mountain lion
loose in the house,

16:24.193 --> 16:26.695
and it was fucking huge.

16:26.778 --> 16:28.530
And I couldn't find Maya,

16:28.614 --> 16:30.324
and I couldn't find you.

16:31.700 --> 16:33.619
And I couldn't protect my girls.

16:37.414 --> 16:38.665
Where did you go?

16:38.749 --> 16:43.587
Pharmacy. Maya's stomach.
Your stomach. Pick a lie. Stick with it.

16:43.670 --> 16:46.089
I went home to my parents' house.

16:47.132 --> 16:48.133
Babe.

16:49.635 --> 16:50.802
Why did you do that?

16:50.886 --> 16:55.724
I just felt so terrible
about dragging you up here

16:55.807 --> 16:59.853
and making you do all of this,
and all for nothing.

17:00.354 --> 17:02.814
And I just wanted to make it right,
and I did.

17:03.649 --> 17:04.650
That's not--

17:07.736 --> 17:08.737
See?

17:13.534 --> 17:14.910
What do they want in return?

17:15.702 --> 17:18.372
Despicable. The depths to which you'll go.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.165
They wanna meet Maya.

17:20.249 --> 17:21.583
You gotta be kidding me.

17:22.459 --> 17:24.461
I will be there the whole time.

17:24.545 --> 17:26.171
She'd never be alone with them.

17:26.255 --> 17:28.757
-It would be totally safe.
-No. No, that is not happening.

17:28.841 --> 17:30.843
Please, please. Please don't.
No, no, no. Please.

17:30.926 --> 17:33.762
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said yes.

17:33.846 --> 17:37.349
But just think of all of the good
we could do with this.

17:37.432 --> 17:39.726
-Everything that you could do.
-I don't care.

17:39.810 --> 17:40.811
It is not worth it.

17:40.894 --> 17:43.522
I would rather owe my soul
to the Ku Klux Klan.

17:44.314 --> 17:48.986
Well, what if it was just my mother?

17:49.570 --> 17:51.613
-Just your mother?
-Well, it wasn't her fault.

17:51.697 --> 17:53.031
I mean, it was Dad's friend.

17:53.115 --> 17:56.201
You told her, and she did nothing.

17:57.286 --> 17:59.872
Well, I mean, what was she supposed to do?

17:59.955 --> 18:01.248
She could've believed you.

18:01.331 --> 18:02.541
Defended you.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.210
But she didn't have the guts.

18:05.294 --> 18:07.671
He really thinks it's that easy for us.

18:08.463 --> 18:09.548
And why wouldn't he?

18:09.631 --> 18:12.509
I mean, how old were you? Fourteen?

18:14.803 --> 18:16.680
I don't know exactly.

18:16.763 --> 18:22.186
Thirteen years old, round-faced,
soft belly. You know exactly.

18:22.686 --> 18:24.730
We don't owe those assholes anything.

18:24.813 --> 18:27.191
Your family is right here, okay?

18:28.025 --> 18:30.319
Maya and me.

18:30.402 --> 18:31.403
Okay.

18:32.362 --> 18:33.363
Okay?

19:06.897 --> 19:08.106
Are you kidding me?

19:08.190 --> 19:12.027
Let me just start by saying
I'm sorry, dude. I'm sorry.

19:12.611 --> 19:13.612
I did a bad thing.

19:13.695 --> 19:17.032
And I had this whole night
riding over here on my skateboard,

19:17.115 --> 19:19.535
trying to talk to you, and I just--

19:20.619 --> 19:21.620
I just--

19:22.579 --> 19:23.956
-Are you holding a knife?
-Yeah,

19:24.039 --> 19:25.791
because I'm pissed at you,
you piece of crap,

19:25.874 --> 19:27.543
and I'm gonna use it!

19:29.711 --> 19:31.338
Did someone creep on you?

19:33.423 --> 19:36.009
Who fucking creeped on you?
Crapped, creep, whatever.

19:36.093 --> 19:37.302
I'll fucking kill the guy.

19:39.304 --> 19:42.474
Some lurker.
I shouldn't have talked to him.

19:43.851 --> 19:46.478
I didn't know where you were!
I wasn't thinking!

19:48.021 --> 19:51.316
Fuck, dude.
That's not on you. That's on me.

19:57.197 --> 20:00.826
When you're not around me,
I make bad decisions.

20:03.579 --> 20:08.000
It's why I need you.
And also, that's-- I'm into you.

20:08.876 --> 20:09.918
Good.

20:10.460 --> 20:12.754
Because you're pretty much
everything I have.

20:12.838 --> 20:14.506
I don't have a backup plan.

20:20.804 --> 20:23.307
Did I ever tell you about that asshole,
Brian?

20:24.766 --> 20:25.809
Your brother?

20:25.893 --> 20:28.187
No, Brian, my brother, he's pretty cool.

20:28.270 --> 20:30.272
Just quiet since his accident.

20:31.690 --> 20:33.442
I mean Brian, my stepdad.

20:34.401 --> 20:35.402
No.

20:35.485 --> 20:37.738
He was just
your classic run-of-the-mill dickhead.

20:37.821 --> 20:39.907
Pushing us around, calling me an idiot.

20:39.990 --> 20:42.409
And my mom would always side with him.

20:42.492 --> 20:45.162
I kept waiting for her not to,
but she always did.

20:46.622 --> 20:48.457
Bullies only lose in the movies.

20:49.208 --> 20:50.459
In real life, they win.

20:54.087 --> 20:55.589
I am an idiot, though.

20:55.672 --> 20:56.882
I mean, I--

20:56.965 --> 21:00.552
I bought this board,
and I don't even remember doing it.

21:00.636 --> 21:03.055
I know we're trying to save.
I just-- I messed it up.

21:06.058 --> 21:08.435
Can we talk about it later?

21:10.062 --> 21:11.563
Fuck yeah.

21:11.647 --> 21:13.398
That is so chill by me.

21:14.691 --> 21:17.945
-Go, sweetie. Sit down.
-Does she need anything for the road?

21:18.028 --> 21:21.532
-Any snacks or anything?
-We're fine. Thank you for everything.

21:21.615 --> 21:25.911
Of course. I mean, I guess,
next time you see me, I'll be a mom too.

21:26.411 --> 21:29.414
I know it's the most natural thing
in the world

21:29.498 --> 21:33.293
and I shouldn't be scared,
but I'm a little scared.

21:33.377 --> 21:36.505
Say something. Reassure her.
Be a human being for once.

21:36.588 --> 21:40.342
No one feels ready. But trust me,
you have everything you need.

21:40.425 --> 21:41.718
There's no need to be scared.

21:42.594 --> 21:44.054
Of the giving birth part, anyway.

21:44.137 --> 21:47.933
Becoming a mom,
that's, you know, terrifying and forever.

21:48.016 --> 21:50.060
But good luck.

21:50.561 --> 21:51.562
You'll be fine.

21:53.814 --> 21:56.024
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

21:57.651 --> 21:59.778
-Bye.
-Great to see you. Good luck.

21:59.862 --> 22:01.405
We'll be rooting for ya.

22:01.488 --> 22:03.574
-Vote Rubin.
-Go Rubin.

22:03.657 --> 22:04.825
-Bye.
-Bye, Maya.

22:06.910 --> 22:10.205
Oh, my God. I thought they'd never go.

22:12.541 --> 22:13.542
Morning.

22:14.209 --> 22:15.210
Morning.

22:16.587 --> 22:19.965
I had the strangest dream last night.
You were in it.

22:20.632 --> 22:22.885
Well, what was I doing?

22:23.635 --> 22:24.928
Saving the world, I hope.

22:25.804 --> 22:27.097
No, you were drowning.

22:29.600 --> 22:31.351
Well, that doesn't sound good.

22:31.435 --> 22:35.063
You were yelling out, and Mom was there.

22:35.981 --> 22:38.942
It was confusing, but super real.

22:40.819 --> 22:42.821
You guys weren't swimming last night,
were you?

22:44.781 --> 22:47.701
That's what happens when
you watch television right before bed.

22:48.452 --> 22:50.829
Especially that Fantasy Island program.

22:51.538 --> 22:52.539
Yeah.

22:53.415 --> 22:54.458
Yeah, that's probably it.

22:55.542 --> 22:57.669
Is Mom still sleeping?
There's no breakfast.

23:24.029 --> 23:25.906
Your mother thought you wouldn't show up.

23:25.989 --> 23:27.241
I said I wasn't sure.

23:27.324 --> 23:29.785
You haven't exactly been reliable
in the past,

23:29.868 --> 23:31.703
so it was only natural to wonder.

23:31.787 --> 23:32.955
And where is she?

23:33.038 --> 23:36.250
She's in the car outside with her dad.

23:36.834 --> 23:38.669
And that's exactly where she's gonna stay.

23:39.461 --> 23:41.672
You know,
I've met a lot of assholes by now.

23:42.256 --> 23:45.175
Rude, nasty, even violent people.

23:45.259 --> 23:48.220
But you're the worst kind of asshole
there is.

23:48.303 --> 23:50.514
In the pretty house with the good manners,

23:50.597 --> 23:51.765
because no one sees it coming,

23:51.849 --> 23:54.726
what an actual blackhearted shithead
you really are!

23:56.687 --> 23:59.565
You pushed me around a lot as a teenager,
and I didn't know any better.

24:00.566 --> 24:02.442
Yeah, I thought you were my whole world.

24:02.526 --> 24:06.822
And now I know that you're just a couple
of scared, old suburban shitheads,

24:06.905 --> 24:08.407
terrified of the truth!

24:08.490 --> 24:10.200
You will not talk that way in my house!

24:10.284 --> 24:12.160
Do you know what happened in your house?

24:12.244 --> 24:13.704
What your old fraternity buddy did?

24:13.787 --> 24:14.830
He came into my bedroom

24:14.913 --> 24:17.207
and he pulled down my pajama pants
and spat on his hand--

24:17.291 --> 24:18.542
Stop it, just stop it!

24:18.625 --> 24:20.961
-Stop it right now!
-And you didn't believe me.

24:21.044 --> 24:24.131
And you still don't believe me.
Well, believe this!

24:26.550 --> 24:27.676
You doing okay?

24:28.218 --> 24:29.803
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

24:47.029 --> 24:48.989
That's my girl. Yeah.

24:54.286 --> 24:55.662
Let's get outta here.

25:23.524 --> 25:24.983
I'm going for a swim.

25:25.067 --> 25:27.778
-Is that a new bathing suit, Mommy?
-No, I've had it forever.

25:27.861 --> 25:29.947
-Your butt looks big.
-Like two pillows.

25:30.030 --> 25:32.157
-You should put on another bathing suit.
-Put on clothes.

25:32.241 --> 25:33.867
Hey, hey. That's enough. Don't be rude.

25:33.951 --> 25:35.786
Mommy's gonna go enjoy the pool.

25:36.453 --> 25:37.454
Enjoy it, sweetie.

25:38.121 --> 25:39.540
Thank you.

25:39.623 --> 25:41.625
All right, eat your cereal.

25:44.211 --> 25:46.547
-Thank you, Mommy.
-Thank you, Mommy.

25:48.215 --> 25:50.634
Rise and shine, sweetheart.
Time to get up.

25:50.717 --> 25:52.135
Look what I found here.

25:52.886 --> 25:55.931
Day's gone, time to see

25:56.932 --> 26:01.645
Hey, sweetheart.
Jesus is coming, look busy.

26:02.604 --> 26:06.066
I saw that on a bumper sticker once.
Sure gave me a chuckle.

26:08.151 --> 26:09.945
Honey, you really need to get up.

26:10.028 --> 26:13.699
My friend's coming home.
Also happens to be my boss.

26:13.782 --> 26:14.867
Oh, boy.

26:17.244 --> 26:19.162
Guess I'll clean up by myself then.

26:20.205 --> 26:22.416
Sure was fun last night, wasn't it?

26:25.836 --> 26:27.462
What do we have?

26:35.012 --> 26:39.016
I still hate LA. It's official.

26:40.100 --> 26:42.519
Thank God. We're home.

26:44.021 --> 26:45.856
-And I'll tell you what else.
-Yeah.

26:45.939 --> 26:50.319
I don't know if I'll be going back
anytime soon, if ever.

26:51.069 --> 26:53.322
However, I am glad that we went.

26:53.906 --> 26:56.825
It reminds me
of what I have right here at home

26:56.909 --> 26:58.368
and what we're fighting for.

26:58.452 --> 26:59.453
That's right.

27:00.746 --> 27:03.123
Well, well, well.

27:06.627 --> 27:11.757
Aren't you two just
as pretty as a nun's twat.

27:11.840 --> 27:14.343
-Hey, Jer. What's going on, man?
-I don't know, bud.

27:14.927 --> 27:16.470
Why don't you ask your wife?

27:17.429 --> 27:18.597
Huh, Sheil?

27:19.890 --> 27:21.850
What the hell's going on?
