one more big birthday

chipped in for that sweater

00:38.042 --> 00:39.042

00:48.043 --> 00:49.792
A birthday present.

00:49.834 --> 00:51.688
Mom and Dad gave Ravi

00:51.689 --> 00:53.542
an old astronaut

00:49.834 --> 00:53.542
for his birthday?

00:53.584 --> 00:55.688
That's even weirder than

00:55.689 --> 00:57.792

00:53.584 --> 00:57.792
me a book.

07:28.083 --> 07:31.959
everywhere.

07:37.083 --> 07:38.876
Uh, guys, hustle up!

07:38.918 --> 07:40.480
Ivan is here to

07:40.481 --> 07:42.042
take us to our old,

07:38.918 --> 07:42.042
rickety space shuttle.

07:42.083 --> 07:43.709
Why do I get the feeling

07:43.710 --> 07:45.334
those are gonna be

07:42.083 --> 07:45.334
my last words?

07:45.375 --> 07:47.292
- No, if history is
- any indication,

07:47.334 --> 07:48.792
Your last words will be,

07:48.834 --> 07:50.585
"Ah! These suits were

07:50.586 --> 07:52.334
supposed to be fireproof!"

07:48.834 --> 07:52.334
(LAUGHING)

07:54.083 --> 07:55.167
If we find an alien,

07:55.168 --> 07:56.250
can I keep it?

07:56.292 --> 07:57.646
Zuri, I think one disgusting

07:57.647 --> 07:59.000
creature in the house

07:56.292 --> 07:59.000
is enough.

07:59.042 --> 08:00.167
(CHUCKLES)

08:00.168 --> 08:01.292
Two, if you count

07:59.042 --> 08:01.292
Mrs. Kipling.

08:04.959 --> 08:06.543
Emma, we're going to space,

08:06.544 --> 08:08.125
not wintering in St. Bart's.

08:08.167 --> 08:10.042
I need to be prepared.

08:10.083 --> 08:12.059
- I don't know what - the weather is going
- To be like, in space.

08:12.083 --> 08:14.042
- There is no weather.
- It's space!

08:15.083 --> 08:16.500
So, I should layer?

08:18.500 --> 08:20.251
There's a twenty in it

08:20.252 --> 08:22.000
for you if you strand them

08:18.500 --> 08:22.000
on the moon.

08:23.375 --> 08:25.459
Have a safe trip,

08:25.500 --> 08:27.272
while I am here,

08:27.273 --> 08:29.042
sick, stuck on Earth,

08:29.083 --> 08:30.626
missing out on this

08:30.627 --> 08:32.167
once in a lifetime

08:29.083 --> 08:32.167
opportunity.

08:34.500 --> 08:35.522
You heard the man,

08:35.523 --> 08:36.542
let's boogie!

08:36.583 --> 08:37.583
(ALL CHEERING)

08:41.626 --> 08:42.833
It's okay, Ravi.

08:42.835 --> 08:44.042
I'll take good care

08:41.626 --> 08:44.042
of you.

08:44.082 --> 08:45.292
Thank you, Bertram.

08:45.334 --> 08:47.042
- Can I have some nice,
- hot soup?

08:47.083 --> 08:49.022
Sure, the deli menu is

08:49.023 --> 08:50.959
right next to the phone.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.168
Oh, and order me

08:52.169 --> 08:53.334
a corned beef on rye,

08:51.000 --> 08:53.334
while you're at it.

08:56.083 --> 08:57.417
(ALL SCREAMING)

08:59.918 --> 09:01.393
- JESSIE: Could you pass
- me the bathroom?

09:01.417 --> 09:03.000
ZURI: Occupado!

09:07.000 --> 09:08.563
Whoa, zero gravity

09:08.564 --> 09:10.125
is so cool.

09:10.167 --> 09:11.417
(BEEPING)

09:11.459 --> 09:12.751
Okay, we are

09:12.752 --> 09:14.042
safely in orbit.

09:14.083 --> 09:16.000
- All things considered,
- that's a miracle.

09:17.250 --> 09:18.334
Speaking of which,

09:18.335 --> 09:19.417
check it out.

09:21.083 --> 09:23.042
Wow,

09:23.083 --> 09:25.000
- I've never seen
- so many stars.

09:27.083 --> 09:28.375
(CHUCKLES)

09:28.417 --> 09:30.042
(CHUCKLES) I know.

09:30.083 --> 09:31.313
It's like someone

09:31.314 --> 09:32.542
bedazzled nighttime!

09:30.083 --> 09:32.542
(CHUCKLES)

09:32.584 --> 09:34.042
Wow.

09:34.083 --> 09:35.375
Can you believe it?

09:35.417 --> 09:36.814
We're among only

09:36.815 --> 09:38.209
a handful of people

09:35.417 --> 09:38.209
in history

09:38.250 --> 09:39.875
to ever experience

09:39.876 --> 09:41.500
the magic of space flight.

09:41.542 --> 09:42.751
I'm bored.

09:42.752 --> 09:43.959
Does this thing get cable?

09:45.459 --> 09:47.250
- Zuri, knock it off!
- This isn't Bertram,

09:47.292 --> 09:48.668
You can't just hit it

09:48.669 --> 09:50.042
and make it do

09:47.292 --> 09:50.042
what you want.

09:50.083 --> 09:52.042
- I.V.A.N.: Thank you.
- You're welcome.

09:52.083 --> 09:53.126
Wait, who said that?

09:53.127 --> 09:54.167
Did we pick up

09:52.083 --> 09:54.167
a hitch hiker?

09:55.334 --> 09:56.688
I am I.V.A.N.

09:56.689 --> 09:58.042
I-V-A-N.

09:58.083 --> 10:00.083
My name stands for

10:00.084 --> 10:02.083
Intelligent Vehicular

09:58.083 --> 10:02.083
Aerospace Navigator.

10:02.125 --> 10:04.000
I am your autopilot.

10:04.042 --> 10:05.626
Wow, you sound like Ivan,

10:05.627 --> 10:07.209
but you don't have

10:04.042 --> 10:07.209
his accent.

10:07.250 --> 10:08.334
That is because I am

10:08.335 --> 10:09.417
programmed to speak

10:09.459 --> 10:10.813
in the correct manner

10:10.814 --> 10:12.167
of whoever is on board.

10:12.209 --> 10:14.167
Oh, that's cool.

10:14.209 --> 10:15.918
Yeah, dawg.

10:17.083 --> 10:18.417
(CHUCKLES) That's so cute!

10:18.459 --> 10:20.042
Totes adorbs.

10:20.083 --> 10:21.250
(SNICKERS)

10:21.292 --> 10:22.668
Hey, that doesn't

10:22.669 --> 10:24.042
sound anything like me!

10:24.083 --> 10:25.042
Yeah, right.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.000
Mmm-hmm.

10:28.500 --> 10:30.167
- Hey, guys,
- let's let Ivan do his job,

10:30.209 --> 10:31.397
So we don't go crashing

10:31.398 --> 10:32.584
into the Sun.

10:32.626 --> 10:34.000
Okay.

10:34.042 --> 10:36.542
Are we there yet?

10:36.543 --> 10:39.042
Are we there yet?

10:34.042 --> 10:39.042
Are we there yet?

10:39.083 --> 10:40.250
- I.V.A.N.: Quit it!
- Okay.

10:41.083 --> 10:42.626
I'm thirsty.

10:42.667 --> 10:44.042
I'm thirsty.

10:44.083 --> 10:46.042
I'm thirsty!

10:46.083 --> 10:48.042
- Do not make me - turn this
- Spacecraft around.

10:48.083 --> 10:49.417
Welcome to my world.

10:49.459 --> 10:51.000
- Or the atmosphere
- outside it.

10:54.083 --> 10:56.000
- Hey, Ravi.
- How are you feeling?

10:56.334 --> 10:58.042
Hmm, let me see.

10:58.083 --> 10:59.709
How would you feel

10:59.710 --> 11:01.334
if your entire family

10:58.083 --> 11:01.334
left you alone,

11:01.375 --> 11:02.375
and ran off to

11:02.376 --> 11:03.376
outer space?

11:03.417 --> 11:05.393
- Have you met my mother? - Like Christmas
- And my birthday,

11:05.417 --> 11:08.125
All wrapped up into one.

11:08.167 --> 11:09.855
And the worst thing is,

11:09.856 --> 11:11.542
I am no longer feeling sick!

11:11.584 --> 11:12.668
It must have been

11:12.669 --> 11:13.751
a 24 hour thing.

11:13.792 --> 11:15.125
- Kind of like
- your last nap.

11:16.417 --> 11:18.059
- Look, Ravi,
- I know you're disappointed,

11:18.083 --> 11:19.685
- But did you really
- expect them to pass up

11:19.709 --> 11:20.876
The opportunity

11:20.877 --> 11:22.042
of a lifetime?

11:22.083 --> 11:23.709
Yes! Space was supposed

11:23.710 --> 11:25.334
to be my birthday present.

11:25.375 --> 11:26.709
I did not read the book

11:26.710 --> 11:28.042
Luke got for his birthday!

11:28.083 --> 11:29.334
Yes, you did.

11:29.375 --> 11:31.084
You caught two typos,

11:31.085 --> 11:32.792
and emailed the publisher.

11:32.834 --> 11:34.251
My point is,

11:34.252 --> 11:35.667
I should be the one

11:32.834 --> 11:35.667
in orbit!

11:35.709 --> 11:37.667
- If there is any justice
- in this world,

11:37.709 --> 11:39.042
They are having

11:39.043 --> 11:40.375
a horrible time in space!

11:40.417 --> 11:42.439
We are having

11:42.440 --> 11:44.459
the best time in space!

11:44.500 --> 11:45.938
And I am really loving

11:45.939 --> 11:47.375
this burrito paste.

11:48.667 --> 11:50.626
- I'm saving so much time
- on chewing.

11:50.667 --> 11:52.042
(CHUCKLES)

11:52.083 --> 11:54.042
- Luke, you don't chew
- on Earth.

11:54.083 --> 11:55.584
- (FARTS)
- Whoa!

11:55.626 --> 11:57.042
(BEEPING)

11:57.083 --> 11:58.855
Yuck. That reeks!

11:58.856 --> 12:00.626
Open a window!

12:00.667 --> 12:01.918
No! Don't open a window!

12:01.919 --> 12:03.167
Do not open a window!

12:04.250 --> 12:06.209
- Great. - Now we're gonna
- Have to smell that

12:06.250 --> 12:07.918
In our recycled air

12:07.919 --> 12:09.584
for the next two days!

12:09.626 --> 12:10.813
Okay, no more

12:10.814 --> 12:12.000
floating around.

12:09.626 --> 12:12.000
I'm turning on the gravity.

12:12.876 --> 12:15.709
(YELLS) Ow!

12:15.751 --> 12:17.334
Space hurts.

12:17.375 --> 12:19.000
(ALARM BLARING)

12:20.751 --> 12:22.417
- What's with
- the flashing lights?

12:22.459 --> 12:23.897
Club Deep Space

12:23.898 --> 12:25.334
in the house, y'all!

12:25.375 --> 12:26.459
Oh.

12:27.542 --> 12:29.042
Oh, no.

12:29.083 --> 12:31.059
- It looks like when Luke
- butt-burped into the wall,

12:31.083 --> 12:32.334
He hit the,

12:32.335 --> 12:33.584
Eject Autopilot Computer

12:31.083 --> 12:33.584
button!

12:33.626 --> 12:35.334
Hey, don't blame me.

12:35.375 --> 12:36.894
- Blame whoever thought
- a good space lunch

12:36.918 --> 12:37.980
Would be a tube of

12:37.981 --> 12:39.042
Mexican food.

12:39.083 --> 12:41.126
I.V.A.N.: Someone is

12:41.127 --> 12:43.167
not getting their

12:39.083 --> 12:43.167
tube of flan.

12:43.209 --> 12:44.834
Oh, no!

12:44.835 --> 12:46.459
The computer is

12:43.209 --> 12:46.459
drifting away!

12:46.500 --> 12:48.147
I told you not to

12:48.148 --> 12:49.792
touch anything,

12:49.834 --> 12:50.939
but, no!

12:50.940 --> 12:52.042
(ECHOING)

12:54.918 --> 12:56.376
Wait a minute,

12:56.377 --> 12:57.834
if I.V.A.N.'s gone,

12:57.876 --> 12:59.196
- then no one's flying
- the ship.

12:59.876 --> 13:01.334
We're,

13:01.375 --> 13:03.209
lost in space!

13:03.250 --> 13:04.709
(SCREAMING)

13:08.083 --> 13:09.334
Whoever said, "In space,

13:09.335 --> 13:10.584
no one can hear you scream,"

13:10.626 --> 13:12.417
clearly never met Emma.

13:14.918 --> 13:16.209
(ELEVATOR DINGS)

13:16.250 --> 13:19.042
Bad news, homies!

13:19.083 --> 13:21.063
The computer that pilots

13:21.064 --> 13:23.042
the craft has been

13:19.083 --> 13:23.042
ejected into space!

13:23.083 --> 13:24.334
What?

13:24.375 --> 13:26.042
- Wait, wait,
- wait, wait, wait.

13:26.083 --> 13:27.376
What about my family?

13:27.377 --> 13:28.667
Are they okay?

13:28.709 --> 13:30.126
Well, they drift

13:30.127 --> 13:31.542
hopelessly in space,

13:31.584 --> 13:33.042
- with only two
- days of oxygen,

13:33.083 --> 13:34.188
So ultimately

13:34.189 --> 13:35.292
they are doomed.

13:35.334 --> 13:37.000
(SOBS)

13:37.042 --> 13:39.189
But on the bright side,

13:39.190 --> 13:41.334
they have all the chimichanga

13:37.042 --> 13:41.334
paste they can eat.

13:41.375 --> 13:43.605
Why is it even possible

13:43.606 --> 13:45.834
to eject the computer that

13:41.375 --> 13:45.834
controls the ship?

13:45.876 --> 13:47.606
In my country, we fear

13:47.607 --> 13:49.334
computer becoming evil

13:49.375 --> 13:50.605
and turning against

13:50.606 --> 13:51.834
human crew.

13:51.876 --> 13:52.960
We see this in your

13:52.961 --> 13:54.042
American documentary,

13:54.083 --> 13:57.959
2001: A Space Odyssey.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.022
Uh, that wasn't real!

14:00.023 --> 14:02.042
It was a sci-fi movie

13:58.000 --> 14:02.042
from forty years ago!

14:02.083 --> 14:04.042
Not real? (LAUGHING)

14:04.083 --> 14:06.042
Hold your phones.

14:06.083 --> 14:07.438
Next thing you tell me

14:07.439 --> 14:08.792
Hogwarts wizard school

14:08.834 --> 14:10.147
is not accredited

14:10.148 --> 14:11.459
institution.

14:11.500 --> 14:12.584
(LAUGHING)

14:12.626 --> 14:13.730
Ivan, we have

14:13.731 --> 14:14.834
to do something!

14:14.876 --> 14:16.398
Is there any way to get

14:16.399 --> 14:17.918
to space and save my family?

14:17.959 --> 14:19.418
Well, we could maybe

14:19.419 --> 14:20.876
take older rocket.

14:20.918 --> 14:21.939
But price would have

14:21.940 --> 14:22.959
to be right.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.522
Oh! I will crack open

14:24.523 --> 14:26.042
my piggy bank.

14:26.083 --> 14:27.938
That is cute,

14:27.939 --> 14:29.792
but it would take

14:26.083 --> 14:29.792
great deal of monies.

14:29.834 --> 14:30.939
His piggy bank is

14:30.940 --> 14:32.042
ten feet tall

14:29.834 --> 14:32.042
and kept under

14:32.083 --> 14:33.230
armed guard in

14:33.231 --> 14:34.375
a corner of Fort Knox.

14:36.125 --> 14:38.042
In my country,

14:38.043 --> 14:39.959
piggy banks

14:40.000 --> 14:41.792
- Do not ask how
- we make withdrawal.

14:42.959 --> 14:44.293
We have to go!

14:44.294 --> 14:45.626
Every second counts.

14:45.667 --> 14:46.855

14:54.000 --> 14:55.439
I cannot believe

14:55.440 --> 14:56.876
we are doing this!

14:56.918 --> 14:58.105
I can't believe

14:58.106 --> 14:59.292
this thing has

I thought it was deadly

15:07.792 --> 15:09.292
we accidentally bring back

15:09.293 --> 15:10.792
to Earth in '86.

15:12.292 --> 15:13.918
We named him Norm.

15:15.834 --> 15:19.876
nervous enough.

This rocket is not

15:22.023 --> 15:24.125
as advanced as the one

15:19.918 --> 15:24.125
your family took,

15:24.167 --> 15:25.751

a hand crank?

15:38.250 --> 15:39.459
Oh, good catch.

Not yet,

17:03.773 --> 17:04.834

17:04.876 --> 17:06.106
now I can add spacewalking

you are stuck in space,

- Oh.

pass out this much

21:28.125 --> 21:32.667
since health class.

21:32.709 --> 21:34.814
Wait a minute!

21:34.815 --> 21:36.918
So, we did not go

21:32.709 --> 21:36.918
into space?

21:36.959 --> 21:38.480
No, but no one wishes

21:38.481 --> 21:40.000
more than I that you would.

21:41.083 --> 21:42.667
Oh, so, it must've

21:42.668 --> 21:44.250
all been a dream!

21:44.292 --> 21:46.168
And you were there,

21:46.169 --> 21:48.042
and you were there,

21:44.292 --> 21:48.042
and you were there,

21:48.083 --> 21:49.792
and your luggage was there.

- What happened
- in your dream?

21:53.167 --> 21:54.625

21:56.125 --> 21:57.834

- It might sound.

are you ready for your

22:06.083 --> 22:07.167
Absolutely!

22:07.168 --> 22:08.250
Just one thing.

22:08.292 --> 22:10.167
- If we pick up
- any alien life forms,

22:10.209 --> 22:11.626
Can we think of

22:11.627 --> 22:13.042
a better name than

22:10.209 --> 22:13.042
Norm?

22:13.083 --> 22:14.563
I think he hit his head

22:14.564 --> 22:16.042
harder than we thought.
