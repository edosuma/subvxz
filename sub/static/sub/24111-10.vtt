Fine. I admit it.
I'm broke.

12:02.288 --> 12:06.023
I only did this for the units, and
maybe because I missed you guys.

12:06.058 --> 12:07.792
Some of you, anyway.

12:09.462 --> 12:12.297
- Ah. Clearly, he means...
- I know who he means.

12:14.066 --> 12:16.033
Ha! I knew it!

12:16.068 --> 12:19.571
And I ain't leaving this till
I see what's in... [YELLING]

12:24.811 --> 12:26.744
[THUNDERCLAP]

12:26.779 --> 12:28.746
[GAMORA] That's the symbol of the Kree.

12:28.781 --> 12:31.115
[QUILL] As in Ronan the Accuser's Kree?

12:31.150 --> 12:32.817
Ruthless warmongers Kree?

12:32.852 --> 12:34.585
Yes, that Kree.

12:34.620 --> 12:36.921
Unless there is another Kree
I am unaware of.

12:36.956 --> 12:39.424
I am Groot! Aah! [GRUNTING]

12:41.861 --> 12:44.562
No, Howard did not
throw us to the Kree.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.097
He ain't like that.

12:46.132 --> 12:47.799
Hey!
[YELLS]

12:47.834 --> 12:50.768
Broke or not, we are not
getting mixed up with the Kree.

12:50.803 --> 12:52.737
I'm putting this thing back now.

12:52.772 --> 12:55.506
Why? The Kree'll
come after us anyway.

12:55.541 --> 12:59.143
[YELLS] We should finish the
job, take the units, and run.

12:59.178 --> 13:01.012
[FEMALE VOICE]
Interesting plan.

13:01.047 --> 13:02.814
I do anticipate one problem, though.

13:04.817 --> 13:07.351
I am Kree Accuser Phyla-Vell.

13:07.386 --> 13:10.221
And there's nowhere to run.

13:14.694 --> 13:16.661
[THUNDER RUMBLING]

13:16.696 --> 13:19.463
Now give me the case and surrender.

13:19.498 --> 13:23.668
If you're an Accuser, how come you don't
have one of those hammer thingies?

13:29.809 --> 13:31.275
Okay, never mind.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.611
I won't ask again.
[DRAX YELLS]

13:33.646 --> 13:35.613
[GRUNTS]

13:35.648 --> 13:38.182
The code says to never surrender.

13:38.217 --> 13:39.851
What are you talking about?

13:39.886 --> 13:43.154
The code says always surrender
and find a way out later.

13:47.526 --> 13:49.260
Just like old times, right?

13:50.696 --> 13:52.897

Aahh!

She doesn't want to hurt the case.

14:47.453 --> 14:49.687
Stand back, or I'll torch this thing!

14:49.722 --> 14:52.189
You have no idea
what's in there, do you?

14:52.224 --> 14:55.059
Nope. But I have it
and you don't.

14:55.094 --> 14:56.895
So drop your sword.

15:03.769 --> 15:05.469

We're about to color you taxidermied,

so tell us what this thing is and why
a Kree Accuser wants it so badly.

15:23.756 --> 15:26.390
Howard, you and me go way back,
but Quill's right.

15:26.425 --> 15:29.093
Ya gotta tell me what's in this case.

15:29.128 --> 15:32.563

Oh, relax. Howard's just being Howard.
He don't mean nothin' by it.

16:06.532 --> 16:08.132
Where's the case?

16:08.167 --> 16:11.002
We left it on the ship,
as per the code.

16:11.037 --> 16:13.637
Code says I can't hand over the units

16:13.672 --> 16:15.506
till you hand over the case.

16:15.541 --> 16:19.010
Code also says
I can't hand over the case

16:19.045 --> 16:21.812
till you hand over the units.

16:21.847 --> 16:23.447
Ugh! Okay, let me guess.

16:34.260 --> 16:38.229
You just added 11 additional

- I am Groot!
- Don't be ridiculous.

17:08.394 --> 17:11.028
Howard's got his own ship.
Why would he steal ours?

17:11.063 --> 17:13.931
Because he's also stealing the item
on board! [ENGINE POWERING UP]

17:13.965 --> 17:18.202
What? Let us go!
We gotta go after him!

17:18.237 --> 17:20.538
No one is going anywhere.

17:20.573 --> 17:23.074
Eyes on me, and everyone listen.

17:23.108 --> 17:25.076
Guardians of the Galaxy,

17:25.111 --> 17:27.211
you stand accused of trespassing,

17:27.246 --> 17:29.180
breaking and entering,
resisting an Accuser,

17:29.215 --> 17:33.184
and stealing a classified asset
from the Kree Empire.

17:33.219 --> 17:35.186
Uh, technically, the duck in our ship

17:35.221 --> 17:37.221
is still stealing said asset.

17:37.256 --> 17:40.024
I do not know what a duck is.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.693
But as soon as I've dealt
with you, I will personally

17:42.728 --> 17:47.098
hunt down your accomplice and retrieve
what's ours with extreme prejudice!

17:47.133 --> 17:48.899
Now hold out your hands.

17:48.934 --> 17:51.035
Don't worry.
I'll have us out of jail

17:51.070 --> 17:53.037

17:53.072 --> 17:57.141
And, thanks to Howard,
we'll still have half our units.

That krutackin',
double-crossin' birdbrain!

18:01.413 --> 18:04.248
Reneging on a payment
ain't part of the code!

The only code I care about
is the Kree Code of Justice.

18:10.289 --> 18:12.790
The volcano is reigniting.

Maybe it's just settling.

18:15.528 --> 18:17.228
[YELLS]

18:17.263 --> 18:19.997
Or it's an acid volcano!

18:24.637 --> 18:28.606
Why can't we ever just have
a regular volcano?

18:28.641 --> 18:31.175
[ROCKET] Howard wants
to steal our ship?

18:31.210 --> 18:33.344
Then we'll steal his.

18:52.998 --> 18:55.299

18:55.334 --> 18:58.636

But ain't no code worth more
than my best bud.

20:03.802 --> 20:05.336
[QUILL]
Called it!

20:05.371 --> 20:08.005
But coming back together
as a team ain't been all bad.

20:08.040 --> 20:11.208
Just, like, 98% bad.

20:11.243 --> 20:13.277
I would say 80% or less.

20:13.312 --> 20:16.581
I am Groot.
[GRUNTING]

20:21.553 --> 20:25.222
We are clearly better together.

20:25.257 --> 20:28.025
On a strictly professional
level, of course.

[GROANS]

20:29.328 --> 20:31.362
[GASPS]
Where am I?

20:31.397 --> 20:33.530
You are on a ship.
We saved you.

20:33.565 --> 20:36.133
[QUILL] Because we're heroes.

20:36.168 --> 20:39.370
And now that we know that, I bet
we all learned a valuable lesson

20:39.405 --> 20:43.374
about not judging... or
arresting... people too soon.

20:43.409 --> 20:45.142
I couldn't agree more.

20:45.177 --> 20:47.544
You idiots really are heroes.

20:47.579 --> 20:50.147
But that in no way changes my job.

20:50.182 --> 20:53.417
A Kree Accuser
never releases a prisoner.

20:53.452 --> 20:56.320
However, I will recommend
that once you are found guilty,

20:56.355 --> 20:58.822
your execution is swift.

20:58.857 --> 21:00.157
Oh, come on!

21:00.192 --> 21:05.262
Hmph! Best bud or not, next time,
I'm leaving her in the volcano.

21:05.297 --> 21:07.431
I am Groot.

21:18.377 --> 21:20.311
I gotta ask, why all the fuss?

21:20.346 --> 21:22.613
If you just wanted
whatever's in this case,

21:22.648 --> 21:24.949
why'd you make me ditch
the Guardians in the volcano?

21:25.951 --> 21:27.418
Because...

21:27.453 --> 21:31.455
they broke my things.
