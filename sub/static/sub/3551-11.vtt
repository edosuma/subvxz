WEBVTT

00:04.305 --> 00:06.107
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:06.107 --> 00:09.040
WILL YOU DO ME THE HONOR
OF MOVING IN WITH ME?

00:09.040 --> 00:11.512
PROPOSALS WERE MADE.

00:11.512 --> 00:14.085
I THINK STARTING AN INTERIOR
DESIGN BUSINESS IS...

00:14.085 --> 00:16.117
IT'S GENIUS.

00:16.117 --> 00:19.750
JUANITA LEARNED THE TRUTH.
 YOU'RE NOT MY MOMMY.

00:19.750 --> 00:23.094
SHE TOLD ME ABOUT THIS GUY
THAT SHE HAD A FLING WITH.

00:23.094 --> 00:25.096
SUSAN REVEALED SHE KNEW
A SECRET.

00:25.096 --> 00:28.159
HIS NAME WAS TOM SCAVO.

00:28.159 --> 00:30.030
THAT WAS NONE
OF YOUR DAMN BUSINESS.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.802
I AM LYNETTE'S FRIEND,
AND I'M NOT GONNA STAND BY

00:31.802 --> 00:34.135
AND WATCH YOU SCREW UP
HER MARRIAGE.

00:34.135 --> 00:36.537
HELP!
 AND WHEN A NEIGHBORHOOD
PROTEST GOT VIOLENT...

00:36.537 --> 00:39.070
JUANITA! GET OFF THE CAR!

00:39.070 --> 00:41.112
JUANITA WAS SAVED...
 (screaming)

00:41.112 --> 00:43.814
SUSAN WAS HURT...

00:43.814 --> 00:46.277
AND LATER, SOMEONE...

00:46.277 --> 00:48.719
(gunshot)
 GOT REVENGE.

00:57.788 --> 00:59.490
(Mary Alice)
SOMETHING HAPPENED

00:59.490 --> 01:01.792
IN THE SUBURBS LAST NIGHT.

01:03.434 --> 01:08.439
A MAN WAS SHOT
OUTSIDE HIS HOME.

01:08.439 --> 01:12.773
DETECTIVES WERE CALLED
TO INVESTIGATE.

01:12.773 --> 01:18.209
AND THEY SOON LEARNED
THIS MAN HAD ENEMIES.

01:18.209 --> 01:20.751
DETECTIVES,
I'M AN EXPERT MARKSMAN.

01:20.751 --> 01:22.753
IF I'D BEEN AIMING
FOR PAUL YOUNG,

01:22.753 --> 01:24.385
HE'D BE DEAD.

01:24.385 --> 01:26.387
I HAVE NO IDEA WHO SHOT PAUL.

01:26.387 --> 01:28.289
ALL I KNOW IS
I NEED A CHIROPRACTOR

01:28.289 --> 01:30.291
FOR ALL THE CARTWHEELS
I'VE BEEN DOING.

01:30.291 --> 01:32.823
IF YOU FIND OUT WHO DID IT,
LET ME KNOW.

01:32.823 --> 01:34.825
I WANT TO SEND THEM FLOWERS.

01:36.497 --> 01:39.800
YES, THE POLICE
HAD MANY SUSPECTS

01:39.800 --> 01:43.103
IN THE SHOOTING OF PAUL YOUNG.

01:43.103 --> 01:46.737
BUT HIS WIFE...

01:46.737 --> 01:50.311
HAD ONLY ONE.

01:51.682 --> 01:54.385
I WAS SURPRISED
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME.

01:54.385 --> 01:57.818
OUR LAST VISIT ENDED
LESS THAN... PLEASANTLY.

01:57.818 --> 01:59.890
ARE YOU HERE TO APOLOGIZE?

01:59.890 --> 02:02.393
YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHY
I'M HERE.

02:02.393 --> 02:03.724
NO, I DON'T.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.856
OBVIOUSLY, YOU DIDN'T
DO IT YOURSELF.

02:05.856 --> 02:07.858
SO WHO DID YOU HIRE?

02:07.858 --> 02:11.162
BETH, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

02:11.162 --> 02:12.703
PAUL'S BEEN SHOT.

02:12.703 --> 02:14.905
(whispers) WHAT?

02:16.267 --> 02:18.439
(normal voice) IS HE DEAD?
 NO.

02:18.439 --> 02:21.472
SORRY. HE'S IN THE HOSPITAL.

02:21.472 --> 02:23.474
WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?

02:23.474 --> 02:24.745
OH, STOP IT, MAMA.

02:24.745 --> 02:28.279
JUST STOP IT. I KNOW YOU HAD
SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS.

02:28.279 --> 02:30.251
BETH, YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.

02:30.251 --> 02:32.323
I-I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
 YOU'RE A LIAR.

02:32.323 --> 02:35.326
LOOK, I'M NOT GOING TO PRETEND
I DON'T HATE THE MAN. I DO.

02:35.326 --> 02:38.329
BUT MY GOAL ALL ALONG
HAS BEEN TO PROVE

02:38.329 --> 02:40.331
THAT HE MURDERED MY SISTER.

02:40.331 --> 02:43.534
WHY WOULD I HAVE HIM KILLED
BEFORE I COULD DO THAT?

02:43.534 --> 02:45.796
THEN WHO SHOT HIM?

02:45.796 --> 02:48.539
I DON'T KNOW.

02:48.539 --> 02:52.603
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO BELIEVE ANYMORE.

02:52.603 --> 02:56.777
I HAVE TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL.

03:02.583 --> 03:04.655
(door closes)

03:06.717 --> 03:09.760
WORD ON THE YARD IS THAT YOU
CAN GET ME A CLEAN CELL PHONE.

03:09.760 --> 03:11.592
FOR A PRICE.

03:11.592 --> 03:13.324
GET IT.

03:13.324 --> 03:16.327
(buzzer sounds,
cell door opens in distance)

03:19.400 --> 03:22.503
SOMEBODY'S BEEN A NAUGHTY BOY.

03:22.503 --> 03:29.380
I GUESS YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND
ABOUT THAT PROPOSAL I MADE.

03:29.380 --> 03:32.613
OH, DON'T GET ME WRONG.
I'M THRILLED.

03:32.613 --> 03:35.616
I JUST WISH YOU'D WAITED
TILL I GAVE YOU THE SIGNAL.

03:35.616 --> 03:40.251
YES, PAUL YOUNG HAD ENEMIES.

03:40.251 --> 03:42.593
I CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW.

03:42.593 --> 03:45.626
MORE THAN HE KNEW.

03:57.768 --> 04:00.641
IT'S SOMETHING WE NEED
TO BE REMINDED OF

04:00.641 --> 04:04.575
WHENEVER OUR WORLD HAS BEEN
TURNED UPSIDE DOWN.

04:04.575 --> 04:07.948
COME THE MORNING,
LIFE GOES ON.

04:07.948 --> 04:13.554
WE PULL OURSELVES TOGETHER
AND GO ON SHOPPING SPREES...

04:14.825 --> 04:18.589
OR REIGNITE A LOVE AFFAIR...

04:20.430 --> 04:23.634
OR GO BACK TO WORK.

04:23.634 --> 04:29.470
YES, WE MUST REMEMBER
LIFE WILL GET BETTER...

04:29.470 --> 04:31.542
UNLESS IT DOESN'T.

04:31.542 --> 04:33.774
YOU TOOK OUT MY KIDNEY?

04:33.774 --> 04:35.476
IT HAD RUPTURED.

04:35.476 --> 04:37.648
YOU WERE BLEEDING INTERNALLY.
WE HAD NO CHOICE.

04:37.648 --> 04:40.781
OH, MY GOD.

04:40.781 --> 04:43.384
BUT YOU CAN GET BY
ON ONE KIDNEY, RIGHT?

04:43.384 --> 04:46.787
USUALLY. BUT IN YOUR CASE,
IT'S A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.789
THE OTHER ONE IS DEFORMED.

04:48.789 --> 04:53.924
WELL, FINE. I WON'T ENTER IT
IN ANY KIDNEY BEAUTY CONTESTS.

04:53.924 --> 04:54.965
(chuckles)

04:54.965 --> 04:59.530
THE POINT IS, IT'S ONLY
OPERATING AT ABOUT 5%.

04:59.530 --> 05:01.702
IF THAT NUMBER DROPS
ANY LOWER,

05:01.702 --> 05:04.405
YOU'RE AT SERIOUS RISK
OF RENAL FAILURE.

05:04.405 --> 05:06.407
HOW DO I NOT KNOW THIS?

05:06.407 --> 05:08.579
I-I'VE NEVER HAD
ANY SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS.

05:08.579 --> 05:11.582
THAT'S BECAUSE THE OTHER KIDNEY
WAS DOING SUCH A GREAT JOB

05:11.582 --> 05:14.014
OF TAKING UP THE SLACK.

05:14.014 --> 05:16.447
YOU MEAN THE ONE YOU TOOK?

05:16.447 --> 05:18.889
YES.

05:18.889 --> 05:20.551
(monitor beeping steadily)

05:20.551 --> 05:25.025
SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
DO I NEED A TRANSPLANT?

05:25.025 --> 05:30.401
EVENTUALLY. BUT WE NEED
TO GET YOU ON DIALYSIS.

05:30.401 --> 05:32.332
THAT REQUIRES
A MINOR SURGICAL PROCEDURE

05:32.332 --> 05:34.605
TO INSTALL AN A.V. SHUNT,

05:34.605 --> 05:37.638
GOING--
 WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
SLOW DOWN. (chuckles)

05:37.638 --> 05:41.412
Y-YOU SAID IF
 IT GOES ANY LOWER.

05:41.412 --> 05:43.844
MAYBE IT WON'T.
MAYBE IT'LL GO UP.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.916
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.

05:45.916 --> 05:47.978
BUT YOU NEED TO COME TO TERMS

05:47.978 --> 05:51.051
WITH THE REALITY
OF WHAT'S HAPPENED TO YOU.

05:51.051 --> 05:52.723
YOUR LIFE HAS CHANGED.

05:52.723 --> 05:57.027
I HAVE SOME INFORMATION HERE
ON DIALYSIS.

05:57.027 --> 05:59.029
I SUGGEST YOU READ IT...

05:59.029 --> 06:01.732
TODAY.

06:08.368 --> 06:11.972
WELCOME TO MISS CHARLOTTE'S
DOLL ACADEMY.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.774
I'M MISS CHARLOTTE.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.506
HOW CAN I SERVE YOU TODAY?

06:15.506 --> 06:17.448
WE ARE HERE TO BUY A DOLL

06:17.448 --> 06:21.111
OH, I'M SORRY.
WE DON'T SELL DOLLS HERE.

06:21.111 --> 06:24.054
REALLY?

06:24.054 --> 06:27.518
WOW.
THIS PLACE GOT CREEPY FAST.

06:27.518 --> 06:32.162
BUT I DO LET GOOD LITTLE GIRLS
 ADOPT SOME OF MY FRIENDS.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.996
ARE YOU READY TO BE A MOMMY?

06:35.996 --> 06:38.398
I DON'T CARE.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.131
OH, SHE'S KIDDING. (laughs)

06:41.131 --> 06:44.134
SHE WOULD LOVE A DOLL,
AND I WANT TO DO

06:44.134 --> 06:46.006
SOMETHING SPECIAL
FOR HER BIRTHDAY.

06:46.006 --> 06:48.008
SO LET'S GET
THIS ADOPTION GOING.

06:48.008 --> 06:51.782
VERY GOOD. I HAVE SOMEONE
IN OUR ROYALTY CABINET

06:51.782 --> 06:53.814
I'D LOVE FOR YOU TO MEET.

06:55.686 --> 06:59.149
LOOK, I AM SORRY ABOUT
EVERYTHING YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH

06:59.149 --> 07:00.851
THE PAST FEW DAYS.

07:00.851 --> 07:03.794
BUT I'M TRYING TO SHOW YOU
HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU.

07:03.794 --> 07:06.026
CAN'T YOU MEET ME HALFWAY?

07:06.026 --> 07:08.428
THIS IS LADY CATHERINE.
 (gasps)

07:08.428 --> 07:10.961
SHE'S THE TOAST
OF BUCKINGHAM PALACE.

07:10.961 --> 07:14.434
THE TRIM ON HER CLOAK
IS REAL ERMINE.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.907
OOH!
(whispers) ISN'T SHE GORGEOUS?

07:16.907 --> 07:19.870
WOW.

07:19.870 --> 07:22.012
I'LL GO PREPARE HER PAPERS.

07:23.544 --> 07:25.646
ARE YOU HAPPY, SWEETIE?
 YEAH!

07:25.646 --> 07:27.948
(chuckles) OH.
LET ME GET MY PHONE OUT

07:27.948 --> 07:30.851
SO I CAN TAKE A PICTURE
OF MY TWO PRINCESSES.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.230
WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT GRACE?

07:40.230 --> 07:43.534
O-OH, I WASN'T. I WAS, UH...
I MUST HAVE SCROLLED TOO FAR.

07:43.534 --> 07:46.066
WHY DO YOU EVEN HAVE
THAT PICTURE?

07:46.066 --> 07:49.670
AND WHAT NAME
SHALL I PUT UNDER "MOTHER"?

07:49.670 --> 07:52.803
PUT WHATEVER YOU WANT.
I HATE THIS STUPID PLACE.

07:52.803 --> 07:54.905
OH--JUANITA!

07:54.905 --> 07:57.007
JUANITA, WAIT!

07:57.007 --> 07:58.178
(door opens)

07:59.980 --> 08:01.652
(door slams)

08:04.515 --> 08:07.918
SUSAN, HI.

08:07.918 --> 08:10.591
I HEARD ABOUT YOUR KIDNEY.

08:10.591 --> 08:13.063
AND I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
I HAVE TWO.

08:13.063 --> 08:15.025
SO LET'S TALK DEAL.

08:15.025 --> 08:18.028
RELAX.
I'M NOT TELLING LYNETTE.

08:18.028 --> 08:20.971
YOU'RE NOT?

08:20.971 --> 08:23.904
THING ABOUT HAVING SOMETHING
LIKE THIS HAPPEN TO YOU--

08:23.904 --> 08:27.207
YOU START TO THINK ABOUT
WHAT'S IMPORTANT AND WHAT'S NOT.

08:27.207 --> 08:30.510
AND I REALIZED IT'S NOT UP
TO ME TO TELL LYNETTE

08:30.510 --> 08:32.813
ABOUT SOMETHING
THAT HAPPENED 20 YEARS AGO.

08:32.813 --> 08:35.284
(sighs) OH. THANK GOD.

08:35.284 --> 08:37.688
IT'S UP TO YOU.

08:43.123 --> 08:45.195
HEY.

08:45.195 --> 08:47.958
Y-YOU OKAY?

08:47.958 --> 08:50.731
YOU'VE BEEN STANDING OUT HERE
FOR, LIKE, 20 MINUTES.

08:50.731 --> 08:53.634
I SAW SUSAN AT THE HOSPITAL.

08:53.634 --> 08:55.305
HOW'S SHE DOING?

08:55.305 --> 09:00.010
SHE'S NOT GONNA TELL LYNETTE
ABOUT OUR 20-YEAR-OLD MISTAKE.

09:00.010 --> 09:03.543
(gasps) OH, THANK GOD.
(laughs)

09:03.543 --> 09:05.646
WHAT A RELIEF!

09:05.646 --> 09:08.318
W-WHY AREN'T YOU RELIEVED?

09:08.318 --> 09:12.322
THERE'S ONE THING SHE SAID
I CAN'T GET OUT OF MY HEAD.

09:12.322 --> 09:14.054
(sighs)

09:14.054 --> 09:16.987
IF I NEVER TELL LYNETTE
WHAT HAPPENED,

09:16.987 --> 09:20.861
THEN MY FRIENDSHIP WITH HER
IS NOT REAL.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.893
SURE IT'S REAL.
 UGH.

09:22.893 --> 09:27.768
ALL MY LIFE, PEOPLE I THOUGHT
WERE MY FRIENDS HAVE LEFT ME.

09:27.768 --> 09:30.140
PEOPLE FROM COLLEGE,
FRIENDS I HAD WITH DOUG--

09:30.140 --> 09:33.073
THEY'RE ALL GONE.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.706
AND LYNETTE STAYED.

09:35.706 --> 09:37.748
I THINK I OWE HER THE TRUTH.

09:37.748 --> 09:40.711
NO. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

09:40.711 --> 09:45.085
SOMETIMES BEING A FRIEND
REQUIRES YOU TO LIE.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.857
I MEAN, COME ON.

09:46.857 --> 09:49.359
WE'VE ALL SEEN McCLUSKEY
IN THOSE JOGGING SHORTS

09:49.359 --> 09:52.192
AND YELLED, "LOOKIN' GOOD!"
THAT'S BEING A FRIEND.

09:54.024 --> 09:56.026
RENEE...

09:56.026 --> 09:58.168
YOU CAN'T TELL LYNETTE.

09:58.168 --> 10:00.701
SHE WOULD BE DEVASTATED.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.873
I KNOW.

10:02.873 --> 10:06.877
I JUST HAVE TO LIVE
WITH WHAT THAT SAYS ABOUT ME.

10:06.877 --> 10:09.780
GREAT. WE GOT A PLAN.

10:12.813 --> 10:14.945
(door closes)

10:14.945 --> 10:17.888
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT A COLD
ROOT BEER TO COOL YOU DOWN.

10:17.888 --> 10:19.720
I LIKE THE "COLD"
AND "BEER" PART.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.723
I KNOW LIVING WITH A WOMAN
WHO DOESN'T DRINK--

10:22.723 --> 10:24.154
IT MUST BE TORTURE.

10:24.154 --> 10:27.658
HOW'S THE REPLANTING COMING?
 IT'S TAKING A LITTLE WHILE.

10:27.658 --> 10:30.160
YARD GOT PRETTY MESSED UP
BY THE RIOT.

10:30.160 --> 10:33.804
I'LL WORK ON
THE SPRINKLERS LATER.
 THERE'S NO RUSH.

10:33.804 --> 10:36.266
AH, LOOK WHO'S DRINKING
OUT OF THE BOTTLE.

10:36.266 --> 10:38.739
(chuckles)
SEE WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO ME?

10:38.739 --> 10:41.812
THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, I'LL BE
FLOSSING ONLY ONCE A DAY.

10:41.812 --> 10:44.775
HEY. YOU STARTED
UNPACKING MY STUFF?

10:44.775 --> 10:46.877
YES. YOUR, UH, BOOKS
ARE ON THE SHELF.

10:46.877 --> 10:48.819
SPORTS TROPHIES
ARE IN THE DEN.

10:48.819 --> 10:51.782
AND ON A SAD NOTE, YOUR BEANBAG
CHAIR ACCIDENTALLY RIPPED

10:51.782 --> 10:54.925
WHEN I STUCK A KNIFE IN IT
AND STUFFED IT IN THE TRASH.

10:54.925 --> 10:56.656
HMM. MY LAVA LAMP?

10:56.656 --> 10:59.089
ACCIDENTALLY BROKE WHEN
I PUSHED IT OFF THE COUNTER.

10:59.089 --> 11:01.331
MAN, MY STUFF IS CLUMSY.

11:01.331 --> 11:05.135
I MAY NOT LOVE ALL YOUR THINGS,
BUT I LOVE THAT YOU'RE HERE.

11:05.135 --> 11:07.968
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED
OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS

11:07.968 --> 11:11.401
MADE ME REALIZE HOW IMPORTANT
YOU ARE TO ME.

11:13.003 --> 11:15.275
MM! WHEW!

11:15.275 --> 11:18.949
(laughs) STEER MANURE'S NOT
YOUR FAVORITE APHRODISIAC?

11:18.949 --> 11:21.151
IT'S ONLY SLIGHTLY WORSE
THAN YOUR AFTERSHAVE,

11:21.151 --> 11:24.855
WHICH ACCIDENTALLY
GOT POURED DOWN THE DRAIN.
 WELL, HOLD YOUR BREATH.
I'M KISSING YOU ANYWAY.

11:24.855 --> 11:26.857
(inhales deeply)
 (doorbell rings)

11:26.857 --> 11:30.190
THERE IS A GOD.
(exhales deeply)

11:30.190 --> 11:32.292
MM. CAN I HELP YOU?

11:32.292 --> 11:35.295
SOMEONE TO SEE YOU.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.469
ORSON.

11:39.469 --> 11:41.401
JUDY KICKED ME OUT.

11:41.401 --> 11:44.104
CAN I STAY HERE WITH YOU?

11:56.346 --> 11:58.348
I NEVER SAW IT COMING.

11:58.348 --> 12:02.292
ONE MINUTE, JUDY AND I WERE
ENJOYING A NICE PINOT NOIR,

12:02.292 --> 12:05.295
AND THE NEXT, SHE WAS
WHEELING ME TO THE CAB,

12:05.295 --> 12:08.158
AND TELLING ME IT WAS OVER.
 THAT'S TERRIBLE.

12:08.158 --> 12:12.432
WELL, DON'T YOU WORRY.
YOU CAN STAY HERE WITH US.
 ARE YOU SURE?

12:12.432 --> 12:16.006
I MEAN, I HAD NO IDEA THAT KEITH
HAD JUST MOVED IN WITH YOU.

12:16.006 --> 12:18.408
I MEAN, YOU'RE A NEW COUPLE.

12:18.408 --> 12:20.410
THE LAST THING
YOU NEED AROUND HERE

12:20.410 --> 12:22.242
IS A THIRD AND...
FOURTH WHEEL.

12:22.242 --> 12:25.776
(chuckles) NONSENSE. WE INSIST.
STAY AS LONG AS YOU WANT.

12:25.776 --> 12:26.947
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, KEITH?

12:26.947 --> 12:28.478
OH, YEAH. SURE.

12:28.478 --> 12:31.181
ANY IDEA HOW LONG
THAT MIGHT... BE?

12:33.253 --> 12:37.527
I JUST WANT TO KNOW HOW LONG
WE'LL BE ENJOYING HIS COMPANY.

12:37.527 --> 12:40.760
I GATHER AS SOON AS I CAN
FIND A NEW PLACE TO LIVE

12:40.760 --> 12:44.394
AND A CAREGIVER.
WOULD YOU MIND BACKING UP A BIT?

12:44.394 --> 12:46.997
YOUR COLOGNE
IS MAKING MY EYES WATER.

12:46.997 --> 12:49.269
ACTUALLY, IT'S STEER MANURE.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.471
TO EACH HIS OWN.

12:51.471 --> 12:53.373
UH, KEITH,
WHY DON'T YOU GO SHOWER?

12:53.373 --> 12:55.375
AND I'LL, UH,
GET ORSON SETTLED.

12:55.375 --> 12:58.178
(kiss)

13:00.981 --> 13:03.153
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME TEA?

13:03.153 --> 13:04.815
MM, NO. I'M FINE.

13:04.815 --> 13:06.516
SO...

13:06.516 --> 13:08.488
KEITH.

13:08.488 --> 13:10.390
INTERESTING CHOICE.

13:10.390 --> 13:14.064
JUST... SORT OF HAPPENED.

13:14.064 --> 13:15.525
HMM.

13:15.525 --> 13:17.267
BUT MOVING IN TOGETHER?

13:17.267 --> 13:19.970
I MEAN, AREN'T YOU TAKING
THIS REBOUND RELATIONSHIP

13:19.970 --> 13:21.801
A LITTLE TOO SERIOUSLY?

13:21.801 --> 13:23.803
IT'S NOT
A REBOUND RELATIONSHIP.

13:23.803 --> 13:27.207
WHAT KEITH AND I HAVE
IS VERY... SPECIAL.

13:27.207 --> 13:30.280
AND I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.
HE IS A BIT YOUNG.

13:30.280 --> 13:33.313
OH, NO. NOT AT ALL. I NOTICE
HE HAS ALL OF HIS BIG BOY TEETH.

13:33.313 --> 13:36.116
BUT HE AND I
HAVE A LOT IN COMMON.
 REALLY?

13:36.116 --> 13:37.948
HMM.

13:37.948 --> 13:41.091
I'M JUST... CURIOUS.

13:41.091 --> 13:43.823
WHICH LIL WAYNE SONG
IS YOUR FAVORITE?

13:43.823 --> 13:46.096
"FO SHEEZY"
OR "ASK THEM HOES"?

13:46.096 --> 13:49.099
JOKE IF YOU MUST, BUT I AM NOT
THE WOMAN YOU ONCE KNEW.

13:49.099 --> 13:51.902
I HAVE CHANGED,
AND KEITH IS RESPONSIBLE.

13:51.902 --> 13:54.204
WHAT I'M WONDERING IS
WHY WOULD SOMEONE CHANGE

13:54.204 --> 13:56.266
SOMETHING THAT WAS
ALREADY PERFECT?

14:07.417 --> 14:11.251
GOD, I NEVER THOUGHT
WE'D HAVE A KID IN THERAPY.

14:11.251 --> 14:15.185
WELL, I DID. I JUST THOUGHT
IT'D BE CELIA. (laughs)

14:19.930 --> 14:22.162
(sighs)

14:22.162 --> 14:24.164
I WISH WE WEREN'T
DOING THIS.

14:24.164 --> 14:26.466
YOU KNOW THE SHRINK
ALWAYS BLAMES THE MOTHER.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.868
THE HUSBAND BLAMES
THE MOTHER, TOO.

14:28.868 --> 14:33.203
HOW MANY TIMES
DO I HAVE TO SAY I'M SORRY?
 YOU KNOW WHAT? IT IS NOT
ABOUT US ANYMORE.

14:33.203 --> 14:35.275
JUANITA'S WORLD
IS COLLAPSING AROUND HER,

14:35.275 --> 14:38.208
AND THE ONLY THING THAT I CARE
ABOUT IS HEALING THE DAMAGE

14:38.208 --> 14:42.012
THAT'S BEEN DONE
TO THAT POOR LITTLE GIRL.

14:42.012 --> 14:44.915
I TOOK HER DOLL SHOPPING.
 (door opens)

14:44.915 --> 14:47.217
JUANITA, IF YOU'D LIKE
TO GO THROUGH THE MAGAZINES,

14:47.217 --> 14:50.190
I'LL TALK TO YOUR MOM AND DAD
FOR A MINUTE.

14:50.190 --> 14:52.062
OKAY.
 OKAY? PLEASE.

14:58.098 --> 14:59.529
(door closes)

14:59.529 --> 15:04.204
OBVIOUSLY, THIS IS
A VERY... UNUSUAL SITUATION.

15:04.204 --> 15:06.106
JUANITA UNDERSTANDS NOW

15:06.106 --> 15:09.209
THAT HER BIRTH PARENTS
ARE HECTOR AND CARMEN.

15:09.209 --> 15:11.211
BUT SHE FEELS NOTHING
FOR THEM.

15:11.211 --> 15:13.213
AND BECAUSE OF THAT,
SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND

15:13.213 --> 15:15.215
WHY YOU FEEL SO MUCH
FOR GRACE.

15:15.215 --> 15:17.187
WELL, IT'S A DIFFERENT
KIND OF LOVE.

15:17.187 --> 15:19.349
IT DOESN'T MEAN
WE LOVE JUANITA ANY LESS.

15:19.349 --> 15:21.051
WHAT SHOULD WE DO?

15:21.051 --> 15:24.054
REMOVE GRACE FROM YOUR LIFE.

15:24.054 --> 15:27.697
WE TOLD YOU.
SHE'S ALREADY GONE.

15:27.697 --> 15:29.960
JUANITA SAYS
THERE ARE PHOTOS OF HER.

15:29.960 --> 15:33.133
HER ARTWORK
IS ON YOUR REFRIGERATOR.

15:33.133 --> 15:35.505
YOU'RE SAYING GET RID
OF ALL THAT.

15:35.505 --> 15:39.609
YES. ONCE JUANITA FEELS
SHE IS AGAIN

15:39.609 --> 15:41.641
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
IN YOUR LIFE,

15:41.641 --> 15:44.344
SHE WILL START TO HEAL.

15:44.344 --> 15:46.576
WELL, OBVIOUSLY, I WANT
TO HELP MY DAUGHTER.

15:46.576 --> 15:49.149
BUT ALL THE PHOTOS?
(chuckles)

15:49.149 --> 15:51.421
WE'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES.

15:51.421 --> 15:53.253
GOOD.

15:57.127 --> 16:00.030
SO WE CANVASSED
YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD

16:00.030 --> 16:02.392
TO DETERMINE IF ANYONE
HAD ANY MOTIVE.

16:02.392 --> 16:04.564
AND, UH...

16:04.564 --> 16:06.696
THEY ALL DID.

16:06.696 --> 16:11.071
YES. BUT SO FAR,
ALL OF THEM HAVE AN ALIBI.

16:11.071 --> 16:15.205
SO... WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP?

16:15.205 --> 16:20.080
WELL, WE'D LIKE TO ASK
MRS. YOUNG A FEW QUESTIONS.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.651
WHAT KIND OF QUESTIONS?

16:21.651 --> 16:24.314
WELL, FOR STARTERS, WE'D LIKE
TO KNOW WHERE EXACTLY YOU WERE

16:24.314 --> 16:27.757
WHEN YOUR HUSBAND
WAS SHOT, AND--
 I'M GONNA STOP YOU
RIGHT THERE.

16:27.757 --> 16:30.660
MY WIFE IS NOT A SUSPECT
IN THIS INVESTIGATION.

16:30.660 --> 16:34.064
SHE IS THE ONE PERSON
IN THAT WHOLE CORRUPT,

16:34.064 --> 16:36.726
BACKSTABBING STREET
THAT I CAN TRUST.

16:40.600 --> 16:41.771
OKAY. UH...

16:41.771 --> 16:45.004
IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO MIGHT
HARBOR A GRUDGE AGAINST YOU

16:45.004 --> 16:47.777
OR WISH YOU HARM IN ANY WAY?
 NOT THAT I CAN THINK OF.

16:47.777 --> 16:50.009
WHAT ABOUT YOU, MRS. YOUNG?

16:53.643 --> 16:56.186
NO. (inhales deeply)

16:58.048 --> 17:00.420
NO ONE I CAN THINK OF.

17:03.723 --> 17:06.756
WELL, THEN, UH, IF YOU CAN
THINK OF ANYONE,

17:06.756 --> 17:09.598
PLEASE LET US KNOW.

17:11.601 --> 17:14.604
DID YOU CATCH THE LOOK
ON THE WIFE'S FACE?

17:14.604 --> 17:16.366
YEAH.

17:24.674 --> 17:27.317
(Carlos) GABY!

17:27.317 --> 17:28.618
WHAT?

17:28.618 --> 17:31.681
WHAT ARE THESE PHOTOS OF GRACE
STILL DOING HERE?

17:31.681 --> 17:34.554
OH. RIGHT. SORRY.
 YOU SHOULD HAVE
GOTTEN RID OF THESE

17:34.554 --> 17:37.627
THE SECOND WE GOT BACK
FROM THE DOCTOR'S.

17:37.627 --> 17:40.430
I'VE BEEN BUSY.
HERE, GIVE THEM TO ME.

17:40.430 --> 17:43.663
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH THEM?
 HIDE THEM IN THE CLOSET.

17:43.663 --> 17:46.436
NO.
WE HAVE TO THROW THESE AWAY.

17:46.436 --> 17:47.597
WHY?

17:47.597 --> 17:49.539
JUANITA COULD FIND THEM.

17:49.539 --> 17:52.772
SHE AND CELIA PLAY
IN YOUR CLOSET ALL THE TIME.

17:52.772 --> 17:55.275
FINE. I'LL PUT THEM
IN OUR SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX.

17:55.275 --> 17:57.277
THE GIRLS DON'T PLAY
AT THE BANK.

17:57.277 --> 17:59.649
WHY ARE YOU NOT
TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY?

17:59.649 --> 18:01.651
DR. LUNT NEVER SAID

18:01.651 --> 18:04.114
WE HAD TO THROW
GRACE'S PHOTOS IN THE TRASH.

18:04.114 --> 18:07.117
THE DOCTOR SAID WE HAVE TO
REMOVE GRACE FROM OUR LIVES.

18:07.117 --> 18:09.859
YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS?
AS FAR AS WE ARE CONCERNED,

18:09.859 --> 18:13.092
GRACE NO LONGER EXISTS.
NOW GIVE ME YOUR PHONE, PLEASE.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.864
WHY?

18:14.864 --> 18:16.726
I'M GOING TO DELETE
EVERY PHOTO OF GRACE.

18:16.726 --> 18:19.429
OH, YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.
 JUANITA IS IN PAIN!

18:19.429 --> 18:21.371
DO YOU NOT GET THAT?!

18:21.371 --> 18:23.633
SHE IS NO LONGER
A HAPPY LITTLE GIRL

18:23.633 --> 18:25.675
BECAUSE YOU DID NOT
PROTECT HER!

18:30.310 --> 18:32.312
SO WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

18:32.312 --> 18:34.744
JUST PRETEND
GRACE DOESN'T EXIST?

18:34.744 --> 18:36.746
YES!
AND THAT IS THE LAST TIME

18:36.746 --> 18:39.749
YOU WILL MENTION HER NAME
IN THIS HOUSE!

18:47.257 --> 18:48.528
(door opens and closes)

18:48.528 --> 18:50.530
OH, PLEASE, NO MORE MEDS.

18:50.530 --> 18:53.763
I'M GOOD FOR WHAT AILS YA.

18:53.763 --> 18:55.465
MIKE! OH!

18:55.465 --> 18:56.906
OH... (sighs)

18:56.906 --> 18:59.569
OH! OH!

18:59.569 --> 19:02.812
OH, I NEED TO LOOK AT YOU.
(sighs) NO, I NEED TO HUG YOU.

19:02.812 --> 19:04.514
(both laugh)

19:04.514 --> 19:05.815
HOW'S MY GIRL? HMM?

19:05.815 --> 19:08.147
HEAR YOU'RE ABOUT
A HALF-POUND LIGHTER.

19:08.147 --> 19:10.450
(sighs) THEY TOLD YOU
ABOUT THE KIDNEY?

19:10.450 --> 19:14.554
YEAH. BUT IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.
WE'RE GONNA GET THROUGH THIS.

19:14.554 --> 19:16.856
DIALYSIS IS NOT
AS BAD AS IT SOUNDS.

19:16.856 --> 19:19.559
I'M NOT DOING DIALYSIS.

19:19.559 --> 19:22.562
WHAT?
 IT'S LIKE SIX HOURS A DAY,
FOUR TIMES A WEEK.

19:22.562 --> 19:25.235
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH
GOSSIP RAGS IN THE WORLD

19:25.235 --> 19:27.237
TO FILL UP
THAT KIND OF TIME.

19:27.237 --> 19:30.240
PLUS, I HAVE A JOB
AND A KID TO RAISE.

19:30.240 --> 19:31.771
BUT THE DOCTOR SAID--

19:31.771 --> 19:33.473
MIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:33.473 --> 19:36.306
THE DOCTORS--
THEY DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING.

19:36.306 --> 19:39.449
LOOK AT THIS. THERE'S HERBAL
REMEDIES AND ALTERNATIVE DIETS.

19:39.449 --> 19:42.412
(sighs)
 THERE'S A LOT OF
OTHER WAYS TO HANDLE THIS

19:42.412 --> 19:44.384
THAN BEING HOOKED UP
TO A MACHINE.

19:44.384 --> 19:47.657
MIKE, I-I FEEL GREAT.

19:47.657 --> 19:50.590
(sighs) AND I JUST WANT
TO HANDLE THIS MY OWN WAY.

19:50.590 --> 19:52.592
(sighs) WELL,
I'D FEEL A LOT BETTER

19:52.592 --> 19:54.924
IF YOU'D LISTEN
TO THE DOCTORS.

19:54.924 --> 19:58.498
AND I'D FEEL A LOT BETTER
IF I HAD YOUR SUPPORT.

19:58.498 --> 20:00.530
OKAY.

20:00.530 --> 20:03.533
GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE BACK.

20:03.533 --> 20:05.505
(both chuckle)

20:05.505 --> 20:06.806
(kiss)

20:10.780 --> 20:13.683
SO THE OVERALL APPROACH
IS CRAFTSMAN,

20:13.683 --> 20:16.386
BUT WITH JAPANESE ACCENTS,
INCLUDING THE LIGHTING....

20:16.386 --> 20:19.319
THE VASES, THE CALLIGRAPHY.
THE TWO STYLES...

20:19.319 --> 20:20.620
WORK PERFECTLY TOGETHER.

20:20.620 --> 20:23.323
AND FOR YOUR HOTEL,
WE THINK IT WOULD LOOK...

20:23.323 --> 20:24.624
(both) JUST GORGEOUS.

20:24.624 --> 20:26.326
(both chuckle)

20:26.326 --> 20:30.860
WELL, I USUALLY RUN
EVERYTHING PAST MY BOARD...

20:30.860 --> 20:32.862
BUT NOT THIS TIME.

20:32.862 --> 20:34.764
I LOVE IT.
 (gasps)

20:34.764 --> 20:37.467
AND I LOVE THE WAY
YOU TWO ARE SO IN SYNC.

20:37.467 --> 20:40.510
WELL, WE SHOULD BE. WE'VE BEEN
BEST FRIENDS FOR 25 YEARS.

20:40.510 --> 20:41.811
(sighs)
WELL, ACTUALLY, UH, 26.

20:41.811 --> 20:43.473
OH.

20:43.473 --> 20:44.974
(chuckles) YOU CAN TELL.

20:44.974 --> 20:49.279
SO, LET'S SEE WHAT YOU HAVE
IN MIND FOR THE LIGHTING.

20:49.279 --> 20:52.282
YOU GUYS KEEP TALKING. I'M GONNA
GO GET THE WATER PITCHER,

20:52.282 --> 20:54.284
'CAUSE THE WAITER
WON'T REFILL MY GLASS.

20:54.284 --> 20:56.886
SO... THE LIGHTING.

20:56.886 --> 20:59.889
UH, YEAH, I HAVE A COMPANY

20:59.889 --> 21:02.992
THAT DOES THESE
JAPANESE PAPER LANTERNS.

21:02.992 --> 21:04.494
MM. THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.

21:04.494 --> 21:06.996
AND YOU KNOW
WE HAVE OTHER HOTELS.

21:06.996 --> 21:09.739
SO WE MAY NEED
SOME MORE CONVERSATIONS.

21:09.739 --> 21:13.973
HEY. LOOK WHAT I FOUND NEXT TO
THE WATER PITCHER. TEE... TA-DA!

21:13.973 --> 21:17.447
OATMEAL RAISIN.

21:17.447 --> 21:19.449
SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN
CRAZY ABOUT THEM.

21:19.449 --> 21:22.452
REMEMBER FRESHMAN YEAR, WHEN YOU
BROKE UP WITH THAT BOYFRIEND?

21:22.452 --> 21:25.455
I KEPT HER ON A STEADY DIET
OF THESE AND TEQUILA

21:25.455 --> 21:27.817
FOR TWO WEEKS.

21:27.817 --> 21:31.321
THE BAR IS ONE OF
MY FAVORITE AREAS.

21:31.321 --> 21:32.822
THOSE LANTERNS WITH THESE--

21:32.822 --> 21:34.364
ARE YOU OKAY?

21:36.666 --> 21:38.368
IT'S JUST, UH...

21:38.368 --> 21:39.599
(sniffles)

21:39.599 --> 21:42.902
(voice breaking)
OATMEAL RAISIN.

21:42.902 --> 21:44.904
YEAH?

21:44.904 --> 21:47.036
YOU'VE BEEN SUCH
A GOOD FRIEND TO ME.

21:47.036 --> 21:48.538
HEY...

21:48.538 --> 21:50.039
HEY, RELAX!

21:50.039 --> 21:53.012
THERE WAS, LIKE,
A HUNDRED OF 'EM ON A TRAY.

21:53.012 --> 21:56.315
(sobbing)

21:56.315 --> 21:57.887
(sniffling and coughing)

21:57.887 --> 21:59.889
SO, TAKE THE DRAWINGS HOME.

21:59.889 --> 22:03.453
LIVE WITH THEM.
AND WE WILL CHECK IN NEXT WEEK.

22:03.453 --> 22:05.725
RENEE, ARE YOU...

22:05.725 --> 22:07.727
YEAH, NO, SHE'S FINE.
SHE'S FINE.

22:07.727 --> 22:09.899
AND WE'LL CALL YOU NEXT WEEK.

22:09.899 --> 22:14.364
AND THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WE ARE SO EXCITED.

22:14.364 --> 22:16.005
(sobbing)

22:16.005 --> 22:19.068
(door opens)

22:19.068 --> 22:20.910
WHAT THE HELL?

22:20.910 --> 22:26.115
(panting) I HAVE TO
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

22:26.115 --> 22:27.777
20 YEARS AGO...

22:27.777 --> 22:30.650
I DID SOMETHING AWFUL.

22:30.650 --> 22:32.722
GOD, WHO CARES?

22:32.722 --> 22:38.057
TEN MINUTES AGO,
YOU DID SOMETHING AMAZING.

22:38.057 --> 22:40.930
(voice breaking)
I SLEPT WITH TOM.

22:48.868 --> 22:50.369
WHEN?

22:50.369 --> 22:53.843
IT WAS THAT WEEKEND
YOU WENT TO VISIT YOUR PARENTS.

22:53.843 --> 22:58.047
AND IT WAS JUST THE ONE TIME,
AND IT MEANT NOTHING.

22:58.047 --> 23:00.149
AND I'VE BEEN
CARRYING THIS AROUND

23:00.149 --> 23:03.112
EVER SINCE I MOVED HERE.

23:03.112 --> 23:06.115
AND IT'S BEEN EATING ME UP.

23:06.115 --> 23:09.088
THAT WAS AFTER
WE WERE ENGAGED.

23:09.088 --> 23:12.021
YEAH, BUT YOU HAD...
BROKEN UP...

23:12.021 --> 23:14.824
FOR THE WEEK.

23:20.430 --> 23:22.071
GOD, I'M SO SORRY.

23:22.071 --> 23:25.404
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.

23:25.404 --> 23:26.736
(inhales sharply)

23:26.736 --> 23:29.739
IN FACT, I CAN'T EVEN
LOOK AT YOU RIGHT NOW.

23:29.739 --> 23:31.881
I CAN'T EVEN...

23:31.881 --> 23:35.515
(voice breaking) BE IN THE SAME
ROOM AS YOU RIGHT NOW.

23:37.687 --> 23:40.520
(sobs)

23:40.520 --> 23:42.522
(door opens)

23:45.795 --> 23:48.558
BUT YOU ARE MY RIDE,
SO LET'S GO.

24:04.844 --> 24:06.546
DO YOU HATE ME?

24:06.546 --> 24:08.618
SHUT UP.

24:10.680 --> 24:12.682
LYNETTE, I JUST NEED TO--

24:12.682 --> 24:13.853
SHUT UP.

24:15.855 --> 24:17.557
(sighs) YES.

24:17.557 --> 24:19.829
I HATE YOU...

24:19.829 --> 24:21.190
A LOT.

24:21.190 --> 24:24.193
BUT I DO FORESEE A DAY
FAR IN THE FUTURE

24:24.193 --> 24:26.896
WHEN I MIGHT ONLY
HATE YOU A LITTLE.

24:28.838 --> 24:31.801
YOU KNOW WHAT THE WORST PART IS?
FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS,

24:31.801 --> 24:34.974
YOU TWO HAVE BEEN WALKING AROUND
KNOWING THIS, AND...

24:34.974 --> 24:36.676
I...

24:36.676 --> 24:38.748
(scoffs)

24:38.748 --> 24:40.810
DIDN'T.

24:40.810 --> 24:43.012
I'M SUCH AN IDIOT.

24:43.012 --> 24:46.786
YOU'RE NOT, YOU'RE NOT.
AND I AM SO SORRY--

24:46.786 --> 24:49.759
OH, MY GOD, YOU REALLY
NEED TO STOP SAYING THAT.

24:51.761 --> 24:55.625
BUT I DO NEED YOU
TO DO ME A FAVOR.

24:55.625 --> 24:56.996
ANYTHING.

24:56.996 --> 24:59.669
DON'T TELL TOM
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

24:59.669 --> 25:01.531
WHY?

25:01.531 --> 25:03.533
YOU SLEPT WITH MY HUSBAND.

25:03.533 --> 25:06.776
CAN WE JUST LEAVE IT
AT "'CAUSE I SAID SO"?

25:11.641 --> 25:14.213
(all)
♪ HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU ♪

25:14.213 --> 25:17.717
♪ HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU ♪

25:17.717 --> 25:21.290

25:28.898 --> 25:31.000
MWAH.

25:31.000 --> 25:34.764
HI. WE HAVEN'T MET YET.
I'M TINA'S MOTHER.

25:34.764 --> 25:37.066
JUANITA CAME TO OUR HOUSE
LAST WEEK.

25:37.066 --> 25:39.068
OH, RIGHT.
THANKS FOR COMING.

25:39.068 --> 25:40.770
(whispers) OF COURSE.
(chuckles)

25:40.770 --> 25:42.541
MOM.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.543
I KNOW.
YOU WANT SOME CAKE.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.545
HOLD ON.
WE'LL GET YOU SOME.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.618
(moans)

25:48.618 --> 25:50.580
SORRY.
THAT'S MY YOUNGEST, CELIA.

25:50.580 --> 25:51.881
OH, SHE'S ADORABLE.

25:51.881 --> 25:54.083
DO YOU HAVE
ANY OTHER CHILDREN?

25:57.727 --> 26:00.029
NO.

26:00.029 --> 26:02.662
I DON'T HAVE
ANY OTHER CHILDREN.

26:08.237 --> 26:11.240
I AM FINALLY HOME.

26:11.240 --> 26:14.774
AND JUST SO YOU KNOW,
I HAD THE WORST DAY EVER.

26:14.774 --> 26:16.075
DID YOU?

26:16.075 --> 26:19.048
YEAH, I-I-I HAD TO MEET WITH
ONE SURLY CLIENT AFTER ANOTHER.

26:19.048 --> 26:22.581
OUR COMPUTERS WENT DOWN.
I SPILLED COFFEE ON MY SHOE.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.583
SOUNDS LIKE YOU
WENT THROUGH A LOT.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.756
BUT I'M MUCH BETTER NOW.

26:26.756 --> 26:28.758
OH, M--OH, OH, OH, GOD!

26:28.758 --> 26:31.060
UH, I FORGOT TO ASK--
HOW DID THE PITCH GO?

26:31.060 --> 26:33.693
GOOD. WE GOT THE JOB.

26:33.693 --> 26:36.666
THAT IS FANTASTIC!

26:36.666 --> 26:39.168
OH, MY GOD. YOU GUYS
ARE JUST GETTING STARTED,

26:39.168 --> 26:42.201
AND YOU'RE ALREADY KICKING ASS!
I AM SO PROUD OF YOU!

26:42.201 --> 26:44.173
WELL, IT WAS MOSTLY RENEE.

26:44.173 --> 26:47.677
SHE DID
THE LION'S SHARE OF THE WORK.

26:47.677 --> 26:50.710
SHE'S AN AMAZING WOMAN.

26:50.710 --> 26:52.341
YEAH.

26:55.384 --> 26:58.187
EVERYTHING OKAY?

26:58.187 --> 27:00.750
YES, OF COURSE. I, UM...

27:00.750 --> 27:04.053
I MADE SOME HOT CHOCOLATE FOR
THE KIDS. WOULD YOU LIKE SOME?

27:04.053 --> 27:05.855
THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

27:05.855 --> 27:08.357
YEAH? MIGHT BE A LITTLE COLD.
DO YOU WANT ME TO HEAT IT UP?

27:08.357 --> 27:11.260
NO. IT'S OKAY.

27:11.260 --> 27:12.762
MM!

27:12.762 --> 27:14.263
AAH!

27:14.263 --> 27:17.266
(stammers)
IT'S--IT'S--IT'S BOILING!
 IS IT?

27:17.266 --> 27:19.338
I-I-I BURNED MY TONGUE!

27:19.338 --> 27:22.011
OH, I'M SORRY.

27:26.846 --> 27:29.118
(faucet turns on)

27:29.118 --> 27:31.721
HERE WE ARE.

27:31.721 --> 27:34.884
OH, BREE, YOU DIDN'T.
COQ AU VIN?

27:34.884 --> 27:36.856
WELL,
I KNOW IT'S YOUR FAVORITE,

27:36.856 --> 27:39.729
AND CONSIDERING
THE ROUGH FEW DAYS YOU'VE HAD...

27:39.729 --> 27:41.360
YOU ARE AMAZING.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.362
(kiss)

27:43.362 --> 27:44.694
HELLO.

27:44.694 --> 27:46.696
OH, GOOD, YOU'RE HERE.

27:46.696 --> 27:49.338
WE CAN EAT.

27:49.338 --> 27:53.703
WHAT'S THAT? I THOUGHT, UH,
WE WERE HAVING SLOPPY JOES.

27:53.703 --> 27:56.906
OH... UH, WELL...
SINCE WE'RE HAVING A GUEST,

27:56.906 --> 27:58.908
I THOUGHT I'D SERVE
SOMETHING MORE ELEGANT.

27:58.908 --> 28:00.249
YOU KNOW WHAT?

28:00.249 --> 28:02.752
TOMORROW NIGHT, YOU AND I
SHOULD MAKE OUR BOUILLABAISSE.

28:02.752 --> 28:05.454
(gasps) OF COURSE.
OH, KEITH, YOU'LL LOVE IT.

28:05.454 --> 28:08.217
IF IT'S FRENCH FOR
"SLOPPY JOES," THEN HAVE AT IT.

28:08.217 --> 28:11.690
BREE, THIS LOOKS WONDERFUL.

28:11.690 --> 28:12.822
MM.

28:12.822 --> 28:14.323
IF I MAY.

28:14.323 --> 28:16.365
"SHOW ME ANOTHER PLEASURE
LIKE DINNER

28:16.365 --> 28:18.998
WHICH COMES EVERY DAY
AND LASTS AN HOUR."

28:18.998 --> 28:20.399
TALLEYRAND.

28:20.399 --> 28:22.271
(clink)

28:22.271 --> 28:25.104
"SHUT UP AND EAT, VARMINTS!"

28:25.104 --> 28:26.375
(clears throat)

28:26.375 --> 28:28.908
YOSEMITE SAM.

28:28.908 --> 28:30.279
(laughs)
 (clink)

28:30.279 --> 28:34.183
WELL,
THIS IS QUITE A THRILL.

28:34.183 --> 28:38.287
I DIDN'T KNOW STANLEY KOWALSKI
WAS JOINING US FOR DINNER.

28:38.287 --> 28:41.450
IS HE A FRIEND OF YOU GUYS?

28:43.492 --> 28:46.455
UM, ACTUALLY, UM...

28:46.455 --> 28:49.158
IT'S A CHARACTER IN
"A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE."

28:50.900 --> 28:55.334
HE WORE A LOT OF T-SHIRTS
AND...

28:55.334 --> 28:57.166
YOU PROBABLY
HAVEN'T HEARD OF IT

28:57.166 --> 28:59.508
BECAUSE WILL FERRELL
HASN'T DONE A REMAKE.

28:59.508 --> 29:02.842
(clears throat)

29:02.842 --> 29:04.213
UM... (clears throat)

29:04.213 --> 29:07.216
SWEETHEART, WHY DON'T YOU
GO UP AND PUT A SHIRT ON?

29:07.216 --> 29:09.518
AFTER ALL, IT IS DINNER,
AND WE DO HAVE COMPANY.

29:09.518 --> 29:12.021
IF IT'S ALL THE SAME
TO EVERYONE, I'M COMFORTABLE,

29:12.021 --> 29:15.024
SO I'D LIKE TO STAY IN THIS.
 WHY DON'T I JUST GO UP
AND GRAB YOU ONE?

29:15.024 --> 29:17.356
IT WILL ONLY TAKE A SEC.
 BREE, SIT.

29:17.356 --> 29:21.190
PLEASE. I'M SURE OUR COMPANY CAN
ENDURE ONE NIGHT OF BARE ARMS.

29:21.190 --> 29:23.392
QUITE RIGHT. THOUGH I DON'T
KNOW WHAT THE FUSS IS.

29:23.392 --> 29:25.394
SEEMS LIKE
SUCH A REASONABLE REQUEST.

29:25.394 --> 29:28.397
GUESS I JUST LIKE DRESSING
THE WAY I WANT TO DRESS

29:28.397 --> 29:30.469
IN MY OWN HOME.
HERE'S AN IDEA.

29:30.469 --> 29:32.471
WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE OFF YOUR JACKET,

29:32.471 --> 29:34.473
SEE HOW MUCH MORE
COMFORTABLE IT IS?

29:34.473 --> 29:37.947
WELL, IF IT'S ALL THE SAME
TO YOU, I'D PREFER NOT TO.

29:37.947 --> 29:40.509
AREN'T YOU AFRAID
OF GETTING FOOD ON IT?

29:40.509 --> 29:42.211
NOT REALLY.

29:42.211 --> 29:45.855
I'M PLANNING ON EATING
WITH UTENSILS, NOT MY HANDS.

29:45.855 --> 29:47.516
(gasps)

29:47.516 --> 29:49.058
KEITH.
 (silverware clatters)

29:49.058 --> 29:50.559
WHOOPS.

29:50.559 --> 29:52.922
ACCIDENTS HAPPEN.

29:55.464 --> 29:58.167
WELL, I SUPPOSE
I SHOULD BE HAPPY

29:58.167 --> 30:01.100
IT WASN'T HIS OWN FECES.

30:01.100 --> 30:04.103
ORSON, I'M SO SORRY.
KEITH, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

30:04.103 --> 30:07.006
LET'S JUST PUT THIS BEHIND US,
SHALL WE?

30:07.006 --> 30:09.979
AND ENJOY THE LOVELY MEAL
THAT YOU'VE PREPARED.

30:09.979 --> 30:11.981
OH, AND PLEASE PASS THE PEAS.
 (sighs)

30:11.981 --> 30:13.282
THANK YOU.

30:13.282 --> 30:16.545
(sighs)

30:16.545 --> 30:18.948
(gasps)

30:21.120 --> 30:23.592
(thud)

30:23.592 --> 30:26.095
STOP IT THIS INSTANT!
YOU'RE ACTING LIKE CHILDREN,

30:26.095 --> 30:30.559
AND I WILL NOT STAND FOR IT!
DO YOU HEAR ME?!

30:32.601 --> 30:34.303
(gasps)

30:37.066 --> 30:39.138
AHH!

30:39.138 --> 30:40.509
OHH!
 (dish clatters)

30:50.419 --> 30:52.081
BREE.

30:52.081 --> 30:55.925
HI, JUDY. I'M SORRY TO JUST
COME OVER HERE WITHOUT CALLING,

30:55.925 --> 30:58.287
BUT I NEED TO SPEAK WITH YOU.

30:58.287 --> 31:00.159
COME IN.

31:04.493 --> 31:05.995
HOW'S ORSON?

31:05.995 --> 31:09.899
(sighs) YOU KNOW HE'S, UM,
STAYING WITH ME?

31:09.899 --> 31:12.001
FIGURED AS MUCH.

31:14.073 --> 31:16.075
(sighs)
WELL, I NEED A FAVOR.

31:16.075 --> 31:18.077
IT'S, UH,
JUST TOO DIFFICULT

31:18.077 --> 31:21.010
FOR ORSON TO LIVE WITH ME
AND MY NEW BOYFRIEND,

31:21.010 --> 31:23.312
AND I KNOW YOU BROKE UP
WITH HIM, BUT...

31:23.312 --> 31:27.086
IS THERE ANY WAY HE COULD STAY
HERE UNTIL HE FINDS A NEW PLACE?

31:27.086 --> 31:29.388
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
HE'S BEEN TELLING YOU,

31:29.388 --> 31:32.992
BUT ORSON LEFT ME.

31:32.992 --> 31:35.494
WHAT? WHY?

31:35.494 --> 31:39.668
BECAUSE HE'S STILL
IN LOVE WITH YOU.

31:47.977 --> 31:50.479
BEAUTIFUL, ISN'T SHE?

31:50.479 --> 31:53.482
(whispers) OH.

31:53.482 --> 31:56.145
SHE'S JUST PERFECT.

31:56.145 --> 31:58.547
(normal voice)
I'LL TAKE HER.

31:58.547 --> 32:01.290
I MUST SAY, YOUR DAUGHTER'S
A LUCKY LITTLE GIRL.

32:01.290 --> 32:03.192
MY DAUGHTER?

32:03.192 --> 32:05.924
I ASSUMED YOU WERE
BUYING HER A PRESENT.

32:05.924 --> 32:08.958
OH, NO.

32:08.958 --> 32:12.461
THIS IS FOR ME.

32:18.037 --> 32:19.368
HEY.

32:19.368 --> 32:21.010
(sighs)

32:22.671 --> 32:27.176
(sighs) I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

32:27.176 --> 32:30.479
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING
ABOUT YOUR EX...

32:30.479 --> 32:33.082
KEITH--
 I GET IT.
YOU HAD A RELATIONSHIP,

32:33.082 --> 32:35.084
IT'S OVER,
IT'S TOTALLY PLATONIC,

32:35.084 --> 32:37.086
AND I'M COOL WITH IT.

32:37.086 --> 32:40.129
ACTUALLY, I JUST SPOKE
WITH HIS EX-GIRLFRIEND.

32:40.129 --> 32:42.631
ORSON IS STILL
IN LOVE WITH ME.

32:42.631 --> 32:44.633
I KNEW IT. I KNEW IT.

32:44.633 --> 32:47.666
LET'S WHEEL HIS ASS
TO THE CURB RIGHT NOW.

32:47.666 --> 32:50.169
KEITH, KEITH, CALM DOWN.
BEFORE WE WHEEL HIS...

32:50.169 --> 32:52.171
ANYWHERE,
I NEED TO TALK TO HIM.

32:52.171 --> 32:56.205
I'M SURE I CAN GET HIM
TO MAKE OTHER ARRANGEMENTS.
 WELL, GET HIM TO MAKE 'EM NOW.

32:56.205 --> 32:58.707
I DON'T WANT THAT GUY
IN OUR HOME ANOTHER NIGHT.

32:58.707 --> 33:00.749
FINE.
JUST GIVE ME 15 MINUTES.

33:00.749 --> 33:02.311
(sighs, chuckles)

33:06.515 --> 33:09.418
I SPOKE WITH JUDY. (sighs)

33:12.321 --> 33:15.324
SHE TOLD ME THAT YOU WERE
THE ONE WHO LEFT...

33:15.324 --> 33:17.326
BECAUSE YOU STILL
HAVE FEELINGS FOR ME.

33:17.326 --> 33:20.129
IS THAT TRUE?
IS THAT... WHY YOU'RE HERE?

33:21.670 --> 33:24.673
LEAVING YOU WAS THE BIGGEST
MISTAKE I COULD HAVE MADE.

33:24.673 --> 33:26.475
I KNOW THAT NOW.

33:26.475 --> 33:28.507
(sighs) ORSON...

33:28.507 --> 33:31.009
TELL ME YOU DON'T
FEEL THE SAME WAY.

33:31.009 --> 33:34.743
JUST TELL ME YOU FEEL NOTHING,
AND I WILL GO AWAY. I PROMISE.

33:34.743 --> 33:37.746
DO YOU KNOW HOW EASY
IT WOULD BE FOR ME TO...

33:37.746 --> 33:39.448
BECOME THAT WOMAN AGAIN?

33:39.448 --> 33:42.491
TO SLIDE BACK INTO
THE ROLE OF YOUR WIFE?

33:42.491 --> 33:44.022
THEN DO IT.

33:44.022 --> 33:46.595
WE HAVE A CONNECTION, BREE,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

33:46.595 --> 33:49.328
WE USED TO.

33:49.328 --> 33:52.030
BUT I'VE MADE
A NEW CONNECTION.

33:52.030 --> 33:54.733
PLEASE, WITH THAT
TATTOOED NEANDERTHAL?

33:54.733 --> 33:57.806
(chuckles) YES, AND I WILL
ALWAYS HAVE FEELINGS FOR YOU,

33:57.806 --> 34:00.669
BUT I'VE... CHANGED.

34:00.669 --> 34:03.312
HOW HAVE YOU CHANGED?

34:03.312 --> 34:06.515
I...
I CAN'T ARTICULATE IT TO YOU

34:06.515 --> 34:08.577
BECAUSE I DON'T
UNDERSTAND IT MYSELF.

34:08.577 --> 34:11.650
ALL I KNOW IS THAT
BEING WITH KEITH

34:11.650 --> 34:14.052
HAS MADE ME
A DIFFERENT PERSON.

34:16.425 --> 34:18.087
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

34:22.091 --> 34:23.732
ORSON...

34:23.732 --> 34:27.735
YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE
A PIECE OF MY HEART,

34:27.735 --> 34:30.739
BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
THAT THIS IS OVER.

34:34.572 --> 34:36.605
I'M NOT GIVING UP.

34:36.605 --> 34:38.107
I'M NOT.

34:41.179 --> 34:43.581
(exhales deeply)

34:46.415 --> 34:47.656
SO?

34:47.656 --> 34:49.358
DID YOU TELL HIM?

34:49.358 --> 34:51.590
DOES HE NEED HELP
PACKING HIS STUFF?

34:51.590 --> 34:55.494
UM... ACTUALLY, ORSON'S GONNA BE
STAYING WITH US A LITTLE LONGER.

34:55.494 --> 34:57.626
WHAT?

34:57.626 --> 35:00.599
JUST, UM,
FOR A FEW MORE DAYS

35:00.599 --> 35:02.601
UNTIL HE FINDS A PLACE
OF HIS OWN.

35:02.601 --> 35:04.433
(sighs)

35:04.433 --> 35:06.405
PLEASE?
HE'S VERY FRAGILE RIGHT NOW.

35:06.405 --> 35:07.706
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

35:07.706 --> 35:10.479
WELL, I CAN'T JUST
THROW HIM OUT.

35:10.479 --> 35:13.782
YOU KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO.

35:13.782 --> 35:15.784
(sighs) I DON'T BLAME YOU.

35:15.784 --> 35:18.787
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT
YOU'RE STILL IN LOVE WITH HIM.

35:18.787 --> 35:20.449
WHAT?!

35:23.152 --> 35:26.255
WAIT! PLEASE STOP
AND TALK TO ME!

35:26.255 --> 35:29.298
BREE, THERE'S NOTHING
TO TALK ABOUT!

35:29.298 --> 35:31.300
WHY WOULD YOU WANNA BE
WITH SLOPPY JOE

35:31.300 --> 35:33.562
WHEN YOU CAN BE
WITH COQ AU VIN IN THERE?

35:33.562 --> 35:36.435
LET'S JUST CUT OUR LOSSES.

35:43.772 --> 35:45.644
YOU LISTEN TO ME.

35:45.644 --> 35:46.915
(panting)

35:46.915 --> 35:49.318
THAT'S WHO I WAS,
NOT WHO I AM NOW.

35:49.318 --> 35:52.221
I HAVE NEVER WORKED HARDER IN
MY LIFE TO KEEP A RELATIONSHIP,

35:52.221 --> 35:55.224
AND IF I HAVE TO SIT
IN A PILE OF STEER MANURE

35:55.224 --> 35:58.927
TO PROVE IT TO YOU,
THEN I'LL DO IT!

36:04.793 --> 36:07.466
(gasping)

36:07.466 --> 36:09.898
(Keith chuckles)

36:09.898 --> 36:12.941
(Bree) MMM.

36:12.941 --> 36:15.744
MIKE, JUST HANG UP.

36:15.744 --> 36:18.307
I DON'T WANNA DEAL
WITH ANY MORE DOCTORS.

36:18.307 --> 36:20.879
HE'S
A TOP KIDNEY SPECIALIST.

36:20.879 --> 36:22.711
I REALLY WANT YOU
TO TALK TO HIM.

36:22.711 --> 36:24.713
I CAN'T GET ANY RECEPTION
IN HERE.

36:24.713 --> 36:29.258
I'M GONNA GO DOWNSTAIRS.
M.J., TAKE CARE OF YOUR MOM.

36:29.258 --> 36:31.860
MOM, THIS PUDDING'S GROSS.

36:31.860 --> 36:33.862
I WISH THEY HAD ICE CREAM.

36:33.862 --> 36:36.365
WELL, I THINK THEY DO
IN THE CAFETERIA DOWNSTAIRS.

36:36.365 --> 36:40.229
WHEN YOUR DAD COMES BACK,
MAYBE HE CAN TAKE YOU.

36:40.229 --> 36:43.672
HOW MUCH LONGER ARE YOU
GONNA BE IN THE HOSPITAL?

36:43.672 --> 36:47.876
I DON'T KNOW. A LITTLE LONGER.

36:47.876 --> 36:52.341
IS A KIDNEY LIKE A HEART?
DO YOU NEED IT TO LIVE?

36:52.341 --> 36:55.314
(Velcro rips)

36:55.314 --> 36:58.917
UH, WELL... YES.

36:58.917 --> 37:03.792
SO... YOU COULD DIE?

37:07.396 --> 37:09.458
YOU KNOW WHAT?

37:09.458 --> 37:13.532
WHY DON'T YOU AND I
GO DOWN TO THE CAFETERIA

37:13.532 --> 37:16.234
RIGHT NOW
AND GET YOU SOME ICE CREAM?

37:16.234 --> 37:18.006
MRS. DELFINO,
YOU'RE IN NO CONDITION

37:18.006 --> 37:20.008
TO BE GETTING OUT OF BED.

37:20.008 --> 37:22.010
JUST TAKING HIM FOR ICE CREAM.

37:22.010 --> 37:24.012
LET ME AT LEAST CALL YOU
AN ORDERLY

37:24.012 --> 37:27.015
AND GET YOU A WHEELCHAIR.
 I DON'T NEED A WHEELCHAIR.

37:27.015 --> 37:30.018
(lowers voice) LOOK,
I NEED TO DO THIS. HE'S SCARED.

37:34.283 --> 37:38.487
SO HOW LONG TILL YOU'RE ABLE
TO PLAY BASKETBALL WITH ME?

37:38.487 --> 37:40.489
OH, NOT TOO LONG.
TRUST ME, SWEETIE.

37:40.489 --> 37:45.864
I CAN'T WAIT TO KICK YOUR BUTT
IN A LITTLE GAME OF ONE-ON-ONE.

37:45.864 --> 37:48.266
(chuckles) OH!

37:48.266 --> 37:51.400
ARE YOU OKAY?
 SURE.

37:53.702 --> 37:56.775
SO, WHAT--WHAT KIND OF
ICE CREAM DO YOU WANT, SWEETIE?

37:56.775 --> 37:58.777
CAN I HAVE
AN ICE CREAM SANDWICH?

37:58.777 --> 38:00.379
OH. YOU BET.

38:00.379 --> 38:02.381
YOU KNOW WHAT'S COOL?

38:02.381 --> 38:04.883
WHEN I WAS AT MY FRIEND JERRY'S
BIRTHDAY PARTY,

38:04.883 --> 38:10.419
WE MADE OUR OWN ICE CREAM
AND PUT GRAHAM CRACKERS IN IT.

38:10.419 --> 38:12.921
THAT SOUNDS... GREAT.

38:12.921 --> 38:16.995
OH. YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE WAS COOL?
ON ST. PATRICK'S DAY AT SCHOOL,

38:16.995 --> 38:19.998
THEY GAVE US GREEN ICE CREAM.

38:21.900 --> 38:23.772
THERE WERE GREEN M&M'S IN IT,
TOO.
 (thud)

38:23.772 --> 38:26.505
EVERYONE ELSE THOUGHT
IT WAS GROSS.

38:26.505 --> 38:28.737
MOMMY!

38:40.349 --> 38:42.851
SO YOU'RE HAVING SURGERY
TO PUT IN A SHUNT.

38:42.851 --> 38:44.493
IT'S FOR THE DIALYSIS.

38:44.493 --> 38:48.697
AND HOW LONG WILL YOU NEED
TO HAVE THIS?
 TILL THEY FIND ME A DONOR.

38:48.697 --> 38:50.829
WELL, THAT WON'T TAKE
VERY LONG, WILL IT?

38:50.829 --> 38:53.101
THREE TO FIVE YEARS.

38:53.101 --> 38:56.365
(monitor beeping steadily)

38:58.437 --> 39:00.569
IT'S WEIRD.

39:00.569 --> 39:04.543
I'M GOING THROUGH THIS WHOLE
THING LIKE IT WAS A MOVIE.

39:04.543 --> 39:06.615
IT WAS HAPPENING
TO SOMEONE ELSE.

39:08.116 --> 39:12.481
BUT NOW... (sighs)

39:12.481 --> 39:13.982
IT'S REAL.

39:15.824 --> 39:19.057
SO I NEED TO ASK YOU GUYS
SOMETHING.

39:19.057 --> 39:21.059
OF COURSE. WHAT IS IT?

39:21.059 --> 39:26.895
IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO ME...

39:26.895 --> 39:29.598
I NEED TO KNOW
IF YOU'LL BE THERE

39:29.598 --> 39:33.642
TO HELP... MIKE WITH M.J.

39:37.906 --> 39:40.909
HONEY, YOU'LL COME THROUGH THIS
WITH FLYING COLORS.

39:40.909 --> 39:43.952
YEAH, NOTHING'S GONNA
HAPPEN TO YOU.

39:43.952 --> 39:45.584
(chuckles)

39:51.590 --> 39:55.724
ABSOLUTELY. YES.
WE'LL BE THERE.

40:00.869 --> 40:03.772
MY HERO.

40:03.772 --> 40:06.635
(sighs) SAVE IT. I HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH WHAT HAPPENED.

40:06.635 --> 40:08.937
COULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR
NEXT TIME?

40:08.937 --> 40:12.410
A LITTLE DOWN...
(whispers) AND TO THE RIGHT.

40:12.410 --> 40:14.412
THERE'S NOT GONNA BE
A NEXT TIME.

40:14.412 --> 40:16.845
THERE WASN'T A THIS TIME.

40:16.845 --> 40:19.017
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU'D THINK ABOUT IT.

40:19.017 --> 40:21.720
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID,
AND I TOLD YOU "NO."

40:21.720 --> 40:24.022
I DIDN'T DO IT.

40:27.826 --> 40:29.758
THEN WHO DID?

40:36.505 --> 40:39.968
SOMETHING HAPPENED
IN THE SUBURBS LAST WEEK.

40:41.970 --> 40:45.874
A MAN WAS SHOT
OUTSIDE HIS HOME.

40:45.874 --> 40:50.178
DETECTIVES WERE CALLED
TO INVESTIGATE...

40:50.178 --> 40:55.784
AND THEY SOON LEARNED
THIS MAN HAD ENEMIES...

40:55.784 --> 41:00.458
SOME HE WAS NOT EVEN AWARE OF.

41:00.458 --> 41:02.591
WE'RE SORRY TO DISTURB YOU
AGAIN, SIR.

41:02.591 --> 41:06.194
NOT AT ALL. ANY LUCK
WITH THE INVESTIGATION?

41:06.194 --> 41:07.866
IS YOUR WIFE HERE?

41:07.866 --> 41:09.498
SHE'S IN THE CAFETERIA.

41:09.498 --> 41:13.071
DO YOU MIND? IT'S A BIT
OF A DELICATE MATTER.

41:13.071 --> 41:16.104
WHAT'S GOING ON?
 SIR, WHEN WE QUESTIONED YOU

41:16.104 --> 41:18.106
ABOUT ANY ENEMIES
YOU MIGHT HAVE,

41:18.106 --> 41:22.611
YOU DIDN'T MENTION
YOUR MOTHER-IN-LAW.
 MY MOTHER-IN-LAW?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

41:22.611 --> 41:25.884
UH, WE DID A LITTLE CHECKING
INTO YOUR WIFE'S BACKGROUND.

41:25.884 --> 41:27.886
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US

41:27.886 --> 41:30.759
HER MOTHER FRAMED YOU
FOR HER OWN MURDER?

41:34.162 --> 41:36.665
I MEAN, COME ON.
WE KNOW SHE'S IN JAIL,

41:36.665 --> 41:39.167
BUT FELICIA TILLMAN HAS GONE
TO SOME EXTRAORDINARY LENGTHS

41:39.167 --> 41:40.669
TO CAUSE YOU HARM.

41:40.669 --> 41:42.631
ARE YOU SURE
THERE ISN'T A POSSIBILITY

41:42.631 --> 41:45.804
THAT SHE SOMEHOW
WAS INVOLVED IN THIS?

41:53.041 --> 41:56.885
NOT AT ALL.
THAT'S WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE.

41:56.885 --> 41:58.647
WITH LOVE AND PRAYER,

41:58.647 --> 42:01.690
FELICIA AND I HAVE RESOLVED
THE ISSUES BETWEEN US.

42:05.694 --> 42:09.157
OKAY. IF ANYTHING ELSE TURNS UP,
WE'LL LET YOU KNOW.

42:09.157 --> 42:11.529
I APPRECIATE IT.

42:11.529 --> 42:14.132
OH, AND, OFFICERS?

42:14.132 --> 42:17.806
THANK YOU FOR NOT BRINGING
THIS UP IN FRONT OF MY WIFE.

42:17.806 --> 42:21.610
HER MOTHER IS SOMETHING THAT
WE NEVER REALLY DISCUSS.
