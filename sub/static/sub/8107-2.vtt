What happened?
You weren't answering.

01:14.909 --> 01:17.370
Because the damn comm cord

He was diagnosed allergic
to the aluminum dust in the makeup.

02:48.461 --> 02:52.173
His lungs failed. He nearly died.
Question is, why?

02:52.298 --> 02:53.883
Didn't you just
say he was allergic?

02:54.008 --> 02:57.720
You may not have legs, but you got ears.

07:32.787 --> 07:34.956
People who fly are immobile
for long periods.

07:35.081 --> 07:38.084
Could be a leg clot that embolized
to the brain through a PFO.

07:38.209 --> 07:39.752
That's an unusual choice.

07:39.877 --> 07:41.379

08:25.673 --> 08:27.633
Okay, here's her address.

08:27.758 --> 08:31.179
I want you to break in
and find out what she's hiding.

08:35.933 --> 08:38.686
Why don't we just ask
the patient for the key?

08:38.811 --> 08:40.771
Well, if you can find out
what she's hiding just by asking,

08:40.897 --> 08:42.440
we'd have to
redefine hiding.

08:43.274 --> 08:45.943
You want to live in this country,

and I want you to wash my car?

This is not why
I busted my ass in med school.

cleaning the car. Big deal.

09:00.917 --> 09:02.627

09:02.752 --> 09:05.213
Work is demeaning?
We're too good for this?

09:05.338 --> 09:07.423
Oh, don't give me that
honest day's labor crap.

09:07.548 --> 09:10.843
We all went to med school so we wouldn't
have to do an honest day's labor.

09:10.968 --> 09:12.803
What about an honest
hour's labor?

09:12.929 --> 09:14.263
In exchange, we get
a shot at learning

09:14.388 --> 09:16.599
from one of the best
diagnosticians in the world.

09:16.724 --> 09:18.893
No, we don't.

09:19.227 --> 09:22.813
If we did, we'd be one of the ones
drawing blood or checking for toxins.

09:22.939 --> 09:24.398
We're done.

09:24.523 --> 09:26.025
He's just not gonna
cut us loose

09:26.150 --> 09:29.904
until we've dusted his shelves
and starched his shirt.

Who's with me?

09:49.423 --> 09:51.175
Are we sure
he wasn't joking?

09:51.300 --> 09:53.427
Maybe this
is just a test.

09:53.552 --> 09:56.764

a test and he wants us to do it.

09:56.889 --> 09:57.890

get up here.

09:58.015 --> 10:00.851
Well, I could try,
but I pulled a muscle in 1987.

10:00.977 --> 10:03.396
I didn't waste two years
repeating medical school

10:03.521 --> 10:06.524
- to be arrested and deported.
- Why'd they make you repeat?

10:06.649 --> 10:08.567

10:08.693 --> 10:10.611

the state of New Jersey,

10:10.736 --> 10:14.532
medical schools in my country
suffer from not being from this country.

10:20.955 --> 10:23.332
You know, if you get it open, you're
gonna have to come down and let me in.

10:23.457 --> 10:25.418
Or, you could just
wait out here.

10:26.627 --> 10:28.296
This is a competition.

10:34.552 --> 10:35.886
Change your mind?

10:36.178 --> 10:37.221
No.

10:37.680 --> 10:40.182
- Then why are you here?
- Never intended to quit.

10:41.934 --> 10:44.854
- Then why did you...
- Intended to get everyone else to quit.

10:46.731 --> 10:48.107
Get off the car.

10:48.232 --> 10:50.735
I need to clean it.
We need to clean it.

10:51.861 --> 10:54.739
I stole his keys.
We'll take it to a car wash.

10:54.864 --> 10:56.615
He's got people breaking
into a woman's apartment.

10:56.741 --> 11:01.078
Obviously, respecting personal property
isn't one of the rules.

11:11.839 --> 11:13.924
I told the super I was
worried about my niece.

11:14.050 --> 11:16.010
She hasn't been
answering the telephone.

11:16.135 --> 11:18.179
Nice guy.
Two daughters in Mount Holyoke.

11:21.307 --> 11:25.853
No evidence of clots, and other than
elevated red blood cell count,

11:25.978 --> 11:29.357
the blood work
was unremarkable.

11:32.651 --> 11:34.904
You got a problem
with the naked female form?

11:36.447 --> 11:37.656
Not at all.

11:37.782 --> 11:41.744
Maybe she's just not used to seeing it
spooning with the naked dolphin form.

11:41.869 --> 11:44.538
That's not a dolphin,
it's a porpoise.

11:44.663 --> 11:47.333
There is a difference, you know.
Salary, for one thing...

11:47.458 --> 11:49.251
You want us to
give you a minute?

11:56.509 --> 11:57.968
High red blood cell
count likely means...

11:58.094 --> 11:59.345
Carbon monoxide poisoning.

11:59.470 --> 12:00.846
There are a lot of
different explanations

12:00.971 --> 12:02.181
for elevated red blood cells.

12:02.306 --> 12:03.724
Yeah, well,
which one fits best

12:03.849 --> 12:06.268
with the damaged flue
that your competitors found

12:06.394 --> 12:09.105
in the gas fireplace
in Osama's cave?

12:11.941 --> 12:12.775
Car's clean.

12:12.900 --> 12:15.861
Did you just see a blond guy
with a pretentious accent?

12:15.986 --> 12:17.405
Can't see an accent.

12:17.530 --> 12:18.697
Good point.

12:18.823 --> 12:20.282
Can I have my
car keys back?

12:22.952 --> 12:25.746
Give me the car keys,
put the patient in a hyperbaric chamber

12:25.871 --> 12:27.748
and no more
prime numbers for you.

12:29.333 --> 12:30.334
Thank you.

12:31.961 --> 12:35.589
The high pressure and oxygen will flush
the carbon monoxide from your system.

12:35.714 --> 12:38.634
This much oxygen for too long
can have some toxic effects,

12:38.759 --> 12:40.386
so we'll do this in cycles.

12:46.142 --> 12:49.019
You're working that thing all the time.

12:49.145 --> 12:51.063

her heart rate and blood pressure.

12:51.188 --> 12:53.232
Yeah, I was until you
pulled me over here.

12:53.941 --> 12:56.110
I'm sending out a consult
on another patient.

12:56.235 --> 12:57.236
COLE: Okay.

12:57.361 --> 12:59.864
What? I'm not quitting my old job
until I'm sure I've got a new one.

12:59.989 --> 13:01.907
- I didn't say anything.
- You had a look.

13:02.032 --> 13:05.077
Yeah, I did. Sorry.

13:05.536 --> 13:06.996
Hey, I think
she's having a heart attack.

13:07.121 --> 13:09.832
(BEEPING)
No, I just feel a little funny.

13:09.957 --> 13:11.083
(WARNING ALARM BEEPING)

13:11.208 --> 13:12.585
Tachyarrhythmia.

13:13.836 --> 13:15.504
Call the code!

13:19.133 --> 13:20.050
Nothing.

13:20.176 --> 13:21.552
COLE: V-fib. Where the hell is...

13:21.677 --> 13:22.761
- Clear!
- Are you crazy?

13:22.887 --> 13:24.180
You can't use those!
We're in a hyperbaric...

13:24.305 --> 13:25.347
Clear!
(DEFIBRILLATOR HUMMING)

13:30.227 --> 13:32.021
She's on fire!

13:32.146 --> 13:33.397
(FIRE ALARM WAILING)

13:43.699 --> 13:44.783
Her heart's beating.

13:44.909 --> 13:46.911
And we are so fired.

13:53.292 --> 13:55.419
KUTNER: We've started her
on nitro and blood thinners.

13:55.544 --> 13:58.088
Electrolytes and post-arrest EKG
were normal.

13:58.214 --> 14:00.216
The attack was not
caused by the procedure.

14:00.341 --> 14:02.134
So, what does cause
synesthesia,

14:02.259 --> 14:04.345
high red blood cell count
and heart attack?

14:04.470 --> 14:09.058
Aren't we gonna discuss what caused
the sudden appearance of burnt flesh?

14:10.309 --> 14:13.437
He brought charged paddles
into an oxygenated room.

14:13.562 --> 14:15.147
And you didn't stop him.

14:15.606 --> 14:19.652
Means either you thought it was a chance
worth taking, making you a hypocrite,

14:19.777 --> 14:23.155
or you thought he'd fail,
making you a cutthroat little pixie.

14:24.448 --> 14:26.450
- What causes...
- Takayasu's syndrome.

14:26.575 --> 14:29.245
Not without a rash and a fever.
It's gotta be Whipple's.

14:29.370 --> 14:31.997
No way. You ever see Whipple's
without abdominal pain?

14:32.122 --> 14:33.457
Stop it!

14:33.582 --> 14:36.877
This argument is distracting
every male and lesbian here.

14:37.002 --> 14:38.963
You're both right.
In the sense that you've convinced me

14:39.088 --> 14:40.673
that you're both wrong.

14:40.798 --> 14:42.800
What about cardiomyopathy?

14:42.925 --> 14:45.261
Structural abnormality
causes the heart attack

14:45.386 --> 14:49.431
and throws clots to the brain,
leading to synesthesia.

14:49.557 --> 14:50.432
How old are you?

14:50.558 --> 14:53.185
I'm 21,
unless it's relevant.

14:54.144 --> 14:55.729
Okay, Scooter.

14:56.230 --> 14:58.524
Do a transesophageal echo.

14:58.649 --> 15:03.028
And since the positive divisors
of 26, are 2 and 13, have them assist.

15:03.153 --> 15:05.364
The rest of you,
go to the cafeteria.

15:05.489 --> 15:09.577
Document 10 things that
can cause infection, each.

15:19.962 --> 15:20.879
I wouldn't.

15:21.005 --> 15:26.135
Someone named 17 thinks there could be
lysteria in the cream cheese.

15:27.136 --> 15:29.221
17's a stupid number.

15:30.472 --> 15:31.765
What's Chase doing here?

15:31.890 --> 15:33.267
You saw Chase?

15:33.392 --> 15:35.644
Last night.
Outside my office.

15:36.103 --> 15:37.438
That's interesting.

15:38.897 --> 15:39.898
It's more curious
than actually...

15:40.024 --> 15:44.862
Chase took a job at the Mayo Clinic
in Arizona a week ago.

15:48.032 --> 15:49.533
Interesting.

15:49.825 --> 15:55.706
It wasn't Foreman or Cameron you saw,
but Chase, the one you fired.

15:55.831 --> 15:57.666
Not interesting.

15:57.791 --> 16:01.170
Someone who looked like someone
I used to know walked by my office.

16:01.295 --> 16:06.383
It's always interesting when repressed
guilt starts unrepressing itself.

16:07.176 --> 16:10.220
The only thing I feel
guilty for is this.

16:16.060 --> 16:19.229
HENRY: We're gonna feed this
endoscope down your esophagus,

16:19.355 --> 16:22.149
try to find where your
heart might be damaged.

16:22.274 --> 16:25.944
It's gonna feel uncomfortable,
but just keep swallowing,

16:26.612 --> 16:28.739
I promise you'll be fine.

16:30.282 --> 16:31.492
She's ready.

16:34.078 --> 16:36.163
Go ahead, take a whack.

16:36.288 --> 16:39.708
Right, so if we don't find anything,
House blames me.

16:39.833 --> 16:41.627
Or you find something
and get a gold star.

16:41.752 --> 16:43.087
Why don't you wanna do it?

16:43.212 --> 16:46.924
House isn't gonna be impressed by a
gray hair doing his ten-thousandth echo.

16:47.049 --> 16:48.425
So, you're just
being altruistic?

16:48.550 --> 16:51.303
That makes you suspicious,
Doctor...

16:52.137 --> 16:55.516
Call me 13.
I'm not getting invested.

16:58.310 --> 17:00.062
Her heart's
structurally sound.

17:00.187 --> 17:03.524
No clots, no valvular defects,
no wall motion abnormalities.

17:03.649 --> 17:05.359
Got that from
structurally sound.

17:05.484 --> 17:07.319
- What did she say?
- Structurally sound.

17:07.444 --> 17:10.114
I assume you're not all walking with me
to tell me you found nothing...

17:10.239 --> 17:12.658
It showed a short
burst in the...

17:14.910 --> 17:16.245
Okay.
Who's next?

17:16.370 --> 17:17.996
It showed a short
burst of atrial flutter.

17:18.122 --> 17:19.748
I ran a rhythm strip twice
and got the same result.

17:19.873 --> 17:21.291
Stop.

17:22.042 --> 17:23.961
Okay, here's how we
diagnose in transit.

17:24.086 --> 17:28.382
I lead, you draft, I move, you move,
I stop, you stop. Got it?

17:28.507 --> 17:29.508
Flutter could mean
hormone overproduction...

17:29.633 --> 17:31.844
Wait a second. Why did you do the test?
I gave it to Scooter.

17:31.969 --> 17:33.011
We didn't think it mattered.

17:33.137 --> 17:34.096
HOUSE: It doesn't.

17:34.221 --> 17:36.056
It matters that you let her.

17:36.181 --> 17:41.979
Okay, 10, 24, 39, run a TRH
stimulation test for hyperthyroidism.

17:42.104 --> 17:44.440
That could cause
another heart attack.

17:44.565 --> 17:48.235
Proving her first attack
was caused by her thyroid,

17:48.360 --> 17:51.071
which is kind
of the point, right?

17:52.740 --> 17:54.366
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.

17:56.076 --> 17:57.661
I ride alone.

17:59.204 --> 18:00.914
The hormones
stimulate your thyroid.

18:01.039 --> 18:03.333
Don't worry if you get flushed
or you start to sweat.

18:03.459 --> 18:05.377
It means the
thyroid's working.

18:05.961 --> 18:08.422
And, if you want,
I can remove that mole.

18:09.798 --> 18:12.050
I'm a plastic surgeon.
You're allowed a little vanity.

18:12.176 --> 18:14.094
I'm fine with
the way I look.

18:14.219 --> 18:15.804
Good for you.

18:16.472 --> 18:21.101
Although, I do find it a bit odd
that someone so self-assured

18:21.226 --> 18:23.771
doesn't want her doctors
to find out what's wrong with her.

18:23.896 --> 18:25.981
What are you talking about?
Why else am I here?

18:26.106 --> 18:27.816
You're jerking us around.

18:27.941 --> 18:30.360
You're handcuffing us
with all these restrictions.

18:30.486 --> 18:31.945
I'm feeling warm.

18:32.946 --> 18:35.240
Her pulse is 120.
Stop pushing.

18:35.365 --> 18:36.867
MASON: If House thought
this would handicap us,

18:36.992 --> 18:37.826
he wouldn't have taken the case.

18:37.951 --> 18:39.411
Or maybe that's
why he took the case.

18:39.536 --> 18:41.622
He wants to see if
we can get it out of her on our own.

18:41.747 --> 18:44.041
What did you
find at her home?

18:44.166 --> 18:45.709
- You were in my home?
- Nothing.

18:45.834 --> 18:49.588
Travel pictures, yearbook,
her name on an employment slip?

18:49.713 --> 18:51.256
MASON: We weren't checking
for that stuff, okay?

18:51.381 --> 18:53.008
Obviously, House didn't
want us to.

18:53.133 --> 18:55.803
You're gonna...
You're gonna out me, aren't you?

18:55.928 --> 18:57.137
You're gonna
ruin everything.

18:57.262 --> 18:59.932
Nobody's trying to do anything,
just relax.

19:00.974 --> 19:04.478
This is not a normal response
to the test. Pulse and BP are too high.

19:04.603 --> 19:06.688
Get away from me.

19:10.859 --> 19:13.779
Get away from me!
Don't touch me!

19:21.078 --> 19:25.749
Paging me during Judge <i>Judy,</i>
not the best way to win my affections.

19:25.874 --> 19:27.292
She had another
episode of synesthesia.

19:27.417 --> 19:28.669
It set off
a psychotic attack.

19:28.794 --> 19:31.088
And now she ran in there, and must have
jammed something in the handles.

19:31.213 --> 19:32.965
So, you call me?

19:33.090 --> 19:35.676
The guy with one good leg
and zero leverage?

19:36.051 --> 19:40.347
We break that door down, security
shows up and her name goes in a file.

19:42.140 --> 19:45.269
Luckily, violence is
not the last resort.

19:45.561 --> 19:48.772
Extortion is.
So, go ahead. Extort her.

19:53.777 --> 19:55.904
If you don't open this door,
we're gonna break it down.

19:57.239 --> 19:58.740
Clever.

19:58.866 --> 20:01.827
An appeal to her deep concern
for hospital property.

20:01.952 --> 20:03.537
Let's see how that
works.

20:08.083 --> 20:10.586
If you don't open this door,
you're going to die.

20:10.711 --> 20:12.045
GRETA: Go away!

20:13.213 --> 20:14.298
HOUSE: Well, you seem
to be getting to her.

20:14.423 --> 20:16.133
She doesn't care
if she dies.

20:16.258 --> 20:17.384
You think she
wants to die?

20:17.509 --> 20:20.846
No, but I think she only wants to live
under certain circumstances.

20:24.641 --> 20:27.895
Open up, or I blab
your secret to everyone.

20:28.020 --> 20:29.313
GRETA: You don't
know anything.

20:29.771 --> 20:31.106
I do.

20:43.452 --> 20:44.328
No!

20:45.537 --> 20:46.914
Anybody think that
a sedative might...

20:47.039 --> 20:48.790
- I'm trying.
- Okay!

20:53.086 --> 20:54.504
Who's that?

21:02.179 --> 21:03.764
Who is she?

21:06.767 --> 21:08.310
Osama Bin Laden.

21:20.656 --> 21:22.282
Who is she?

21:25.369 --> 21:26.662
Is she okay?

21:26.787 --> 21:29.539
She's stable.
Who is she?

21:30.666 --> 21:32.000
HENRY: What did
House tell you?

21:32.125 --> 21:35.754
That she is on the run
from an international crime syndicate.

21:35.879 --> 21:37.172
That's what he told us.

21:37.297 --> 21:40.509
House may be your boss,
but I'm House's boss.

21:40.634 --> 21:43.136
You wanna work here,
I better be okay with it!

21:43.261 --> 21:46.139
Honestly, he didn't tell us anything
about who she was or what she...

21:46.264 --> 21:48.141
MASON: Her name's
Greta Cooper.

21:50.143 --> 21:51.311
Wants to be an astronaut.

21:51.436 --> 21:54.982
Doesn't want NASA to know her brain's
getting her ears confused with her eyes.

21:56.358 --> 21:58.151
I went through her mail.

22:00.028 --> 22:04.241
You're a virus, House. Now instead
of one liability, I've got 20.

22:04.366 --> 22:07.953
Apparently only 19.
Which number was it?

22:08.078 --> 22:10.580
From now on, everything you
do gets charted.

22:10.706 --> 22:12.833
With pen, on paper,
in a binder that says,

22:12.958 --> 22:15.043
"Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital"
on the cover.

22:15.168 --> 22:16.211
Mom!

22:16.336 --> 22:18.463
If you wanna run something
through the labs, I get a copy.

22:18.588 --> 22:20.632
If you do scans,
I get a copy.

22:20.757 --> 22:24.261
If you think about doing scans,
I get a copy.

22:24.386 --> 22:27.806
You know my current thoughts, right?
I don't have to put those on paper.

22:33.186 --> 22:34.730
Three issues.

22:34.855 --> 22:38.108
One, number 10,
you're fired.

22:38.567 --> 22:39.484
She told you?

22:39.609 --> 22:41.570
Well, it had to be someone
who went to her home.

22:41.695 --> 22:44.656
Number 26 is half asleep.
Missed his afternoon nap.

22:44.781 --> 22:46.033
Obviously,
he doesn't feel guilt.

22:46.158 --> 22:48.076
Number 2 is here on a visa,
she can't jeopardize.

22:48.201 --> 22:49.077
You can't know.

22:49.202 --> 22:52.289
And that chick's been pointing at you
since I walked in.

22:53.498 --> 22:56.835
Issue two,
what causes synesthesia,

22:56.960 --> 23:00.172
high RBC, tachyarrhythmia
and panic attacks?

23:00.297 --> 23:02.632
Slight glucose elevation.
That says thyroid.

23:02.758 --> 23:05.469
- Baseline thyrotropin's 1.1.
- 1.3.

23:05.594 --> 23:06.887
Whatever.
Her thyroid's working.

23:07.012 --> 23:08.013
What about her liver?

23:08.138 --> 23:10.640
Original ALT levels weren't abnormal,
but were near the edge.

23:10.766 --> 23:12.684
- She has patient data on her PDA.
- I do not.

23:12.809 --> 23:15.395
I saw the lab values. You said
we couldn't write anything down.

23:15.520 --> 23:16.813
I also said
I wanted answers.

23:16.938 --> 23:19.900
Liver cancer's the most likely.
Paraneoplastic syndrome.

23:20.025 --> 23:21.234
We need to do an MRI.

23:21.359 --> 23:22.569
Which brings us
to issue three.

23:22.694 --> 23:24.237
You're saying we
can write stuff down?

23:24.362 --> 23:25.822
To you, I'm saying,
you're fired.

23:25.947 --> 23:27.657
- To everyone else...
- But you said specifically...

23:27.783 --> 23:29.201
I hate tattletales.

23:29.326 --> 23:31.620
- She tattled on 10.
- Now, you've tattled twice.

23:32.662 --> 23:34.372
Issue three...

23:34.498 --> 23:36.041
Come on, let's go.

23:37.459 --> 23:40.629
Issue three, how do we do tests
when we can't do tests?

23:40.754 --> 23:43.840
Dr. Cuddy didn't say we can't do tests,
she said we have to chart.

23:43.965 --> 23:46.718
If we chart, we won't get consent,
so we can't.

23:46.843 --> 23:48.929
The patient's life may
depend on her consenting.

23:49.054 --> 23:51.973
Her dreams depend on
her not consenting.

23:52.099 --> 23:56.186
So, how do we do tests
when we can't do tests?

23:57.020 --> 23:59.106
You've got an hour.

24:03.610 --> 24:07.322
How do you scan a liver
without scanning a liver?

24:07.447 --> 24:09.366
And what's
Cameron doing here?

24:10.200 --> 24:13.537
Interesting,
so you're seeing Cameron now.

24:13.662 --> 24:18.500
No, not interesting,
because not seeing. Saw.

24:19.835 --> 24:22.671
My patient won't consent
to MRIs or ultrasounds.

24:22.796 --> 24:24.840
You've dealt with more liver cancer
than anyone else here.

24:24.965 --> 24:28.885
So, you want me to share the secret
scanning techniques I learnt in Nepal?

24:29.010 --> 24:31.638
Unfortunately, the monks made me
swear a blood oath.

24:31.763 --> 24:32.931
Where was she?

24:33.056 --> 24:34.099
In the lobby.

24:35.308 --> 24:37.519
I guess, we could palpate
the area around the liver.

24:37.644 --> 24:40.647
Which won't work unless
the tumor's enormous, which you know,

24:40.772 --> 24:43.567
which means you're here because
these visions are freaking you out.

24:43.692 --> 24:45.026
Did...

24:45.235 --> 24:48.530
She had blond hair.
Why would I hallucinate that?

24:48.655 --> 24:50.532
Yes! yes!

24:50.657 --> 24:53.577
Why are you merging
Cameron and Chase?

24:53.702 --> 24:57.372
We should find out before the next time
you see her, when she'll be black.

24:57.497 --> 24:59.916
Because, of course, it's scientifically
impossible for a person

25:00.041 --> 25:02.377
to go back and visit
somewhere they worked.

25:02.502 --> 25:04.504
No. But since
she's not a dead cat,

25:04.629 --> 25:08.383
it is scientifically impossible for her
to be in two places at once.

25:09.092 --> 25:11.595
Physics joke.
Don't hear enough of those.

25:11.720 --> 25:14.389
She just called
me from Arizona.

25:14.723 --> 25:16.850
Notice the area code, 480.

25:16.975 --> 25:19.561
They put an offer on
a place in Scottsdale.

25:19.686 --> 25:22.063
Do you want to talk or should I?
I guess we could both talk.

25:22.189 --> 25:24.608
Although, they're engaged,
and if you're staying in touch,

25:24.733 --> 25:26.568
you might wanna buy them...

25:31.364 --> 25:35.076
Maybe it's not repressed guilt,
maybe it's just panic.

25:35.785 --> 25:38.079
Right now, you've got enough fellows
to build a rail road,

25:38.205 --> 25:40.498
but you're gonna have to
narrow that room full of numbers

25:40.624 --> 25:41.541
down to three people.

25:41.666 --> 25:45.670
Any chance you could turn this creative
brilliance towards my patient's liver?

25:46.546 --> 25:48.256
I think you're
gonna choose people

25:48.381 --> 25:50.300
for reasons that have nothing
to do with their skills.

25:50.425 --> 25:54.387
I think you're gonna choose people
just because you can't stand them.

25:54.512 --> 25:57.724
Because if you like them,
well, that's just

25:58.850 --> 26:00.352
stressful.

26:02.062 --> 26:03.355
Stress.

26:04.689 --> 26:05.815
I like it.

26:10.070 --> 26:12.030
We need to stress
the patient's liver.

26:12.155 --> 26:13.281
You mean make her sick?

26:13.406 --> 26:15.617
I mean, make her
sick in a specific way.

26:15.742 --> 26:18.745
If her liver's given to malfunctioning,
we make it malfunction.

26:18.870 --> 26:20.747
Are we on the other
side of wrong here?

26:20.872 --> 26:23.541
Don't we have an ethics board
that we should consult, or...

26:23.667 --> 26:25.043
I fired you.

26:25.168 --> 26:26.336
No, you didn't.

26:26.461 --> 26:28.421
He fired you,
you're number 6.

26:28.546 --> 26:30.799
No, I'm not.
I'm number 9.

26:30.924 --> 26:33.426
I approve of
your shamelessness.

26:33.551 --> 26:35.262
You're still fired.

26:35.387 --> 26:37.013
So, how do we
stress her liver?

26:37.138 --> 26:39.557
Lying and paperwork, I get.
Shutting down organs, I think...

26:39.683 --> 26:42.560
We could give her intravenous vitamin D
and stick her in a tanning booth.

26:42.727 --> 26:46.231
If she goes into a coma,
we know it's a metabolic problem.

26:46.356 --> 26:47.440
Nice.

26:47.565 --> 26:49.859
But vitamin D's metabolized
by the liver and kidneys.

26:49.985 --> 26:51.611
It wouldn't tell us
which one's screwed up.

26:51.736 --> 26:53.989
KUTNER: We could
get her wasted.

26:55.532 --> 26:58.368
Give her shots of tequila and measure
how long it takes for her to pass out.

26:58.493 --> 27:01.371
If it's too fast, then we know her liver
is not processing alcohol.

27:01.496 --> 27:03.331
Means it's shot.

27:04.374 --> 27:06.376
I like you, number 9.

27:13.842 --> 27:15.051
You wanted to see me?

27:15.176 --> 27:16.386
You a Mormon?

27:18.680 --> 27:21.141
You're wearing
a ring from Brigham Young.

27:22.100 --> 27:24.436
Or did your folks
just do the lawns?

27:24.561 --> 27:27.063
The Church has a very progressive
attitude towards racial equality.

27:27.188 --> 27:29.983
Don't care.
Actually, I'm thanking God.

27:30.775 --> 27:33.194
You're the only
non-drinker we got.

27:33.320 --> 27:34.195
We need a control group

27:34.321 --> 27:38.199
to establish whether the liver's
deterioration is within normal range.

27:38.325 --> 27:41.578
Got a big drinker, a medium drinker,
now I got a no-drinker.

27:41.703 --> 27:43.621
Just do an MRI.

27:45.623 --> 27:48.835
You really think the guy
who created heaven and earth

27:48.960 --> 27:51.421
cares what you put in
your digestive tract?

27:51.546 --> 27:54.049
Her dream shouldn't
outrank my religious belief.

27:54.174 --> 27:56.760
Why not?
Her dream might come true.

27:59.137 --> 28:01.556
All life is sacred, right?

28:02.223 --> 28:04.768
We're not saving her life.
We're doing a diagnostic test.

28:04.893 --> 28:06.311
Not even a real
diagnostic test.

28:06.436 --> 28:10.106
Well, that fake test
might really save her life.

28:12.150 --> 28:15.570
Would you pull an ass out
of a pit on the Sabbath?

28:19.366 --> 28:25.663
Would you or would you not pull an ass
out of a pit on the Sabbath?

28:30.001 --> 28:32.170
Fine. I'll do it.

28:34.089 --> 28:35.256
Good.

28:40.637 --> 28:42.430
Why'd you have
to pick tequila?

28:42.555 --> 28:45.433
I assume a single malt
would've worked just as well.

28:45.558 --> 28:47.394
THIRTEEN: Wasn't our choice.

28:50.105 --> 28:53.817
Okay, two minutes,
then round number five.

28:55.402 --> 28:57.570
So, tell me about
the magic underwear.

28:59.781 --> 29:01.366
Is that why you're here?

29:01.491 --> 29:04.202
I'm the big drinker,
doing my part for science.

29:04.327 --> 29:07.705
The interesting question is
why your religious beliefs

29:07.831 --> 29:10.250
are suddenly less important
than her dreams.

29:10.375 --> 29:11.501
You're reversing
your argument?

29:11.626 --> 29:12.961
I know what I believe.

29:13.086 --> 29:14.504
I'm just not quite
sure what you believe.

29:14.629 --> 29:17.841
Well, IDS doesn't try
to dictate every detail of our lives.

29:17.966 --> 29:21.803
When a situation isn't clear, we're
encouraged to make our own decisions.

29:21.928 --> 29:23.680
But your judgment
was to say no.

29:24.472 --> 29:25.515
You used my judgment.

29:25.640 --> 29:27.142
You made a good argument.

29:27.267 --> 29:30.437
Rational arguments
don't usually work on religious people.

29:30.562 --> 29:32.730
Otherwise, there would
be no religious people.

29:32.856 --> 29:33.690
You're an atheist.

29:33.815 --> 29:35.400
HOUSE: Only on
Christmas and Easter.

29:35.525 --> 29:37.277
Rest of the time,
it doesn't really matter.

29:37.402 --> 29:38.862
Where's the fun in that?

29:38.987 --> 29:40.613
A finite un-mysterious universe?

29:40.738 --> 29:43.658
It's not about fun.
It's about the truth.

29:43.783 --> 29:45.493
The truth is we're having this debate

29:45.618 --> 29:47.829
because you wanna
figure something out about me.

29:47.954 --> 29:49.831
What have you got so far?

29:50.707 --> 29:52.125
(GRETA BREATHING HEAVILY)

29:52.250 --> 29:53.877
Greta! Greta!

29:54.002 --> 29:55.295
COLE: She can't breathe.
We need to intubate.

29:55.420 --> 29:56.546
GRETA: No!

29:56.671 --> 29:58.256
At least oxygen.

29:58.840 --> 30:00.884
NASA will need
to know why!

30:01.009 --> 30:03.136
(GASPING HEAVILY)

30:12.187 --> 30:13.813
I checked the tests
you ordered.

30:14.481 --> 30:15.440
Did you just see Foreman?

30:15.565 --> 30:18.151
You measured
the density of her teeth.

30:18.276 --> 30:21.029
It's a shortcut
test for hypocalcaemia.

30:21.154 --> 30:22.363
You had to have
just passed him.

30:22.489 --> 30:24.282
So, you suspected
hypocalcaemia

30:24.407 --> 30:26.451
from her complete
lack of broken bones?

30:26.576 --> 30:29.162
Is that why you also
ran three tox screens?

30:29.287 --> 30:31.372
Patient might have
been sneaking uppers.

30:31.498 --> 30:32.916
He was in a white coat.
Did you hire him back?

30:33.041 --> 30:36.044
Foreman is running the
diagnostic department at New York Mercy.

30:43.468 --> 30:45.345
Have you been drinking?

31:06.407 --> 31:07.408
She was having
trouble breathing.

31:07.534 --> 31:09.452
Refused oxygen
and intubation.

31:10.328 --> 31:12.121
So you put her
on a treadmill?

31:12.247 --> 31:14.040
Records will show
that we gave her oxygen

31:14.165 --> 31:17.293
as a part of
a routine cardio stress test.

31:17.418 --> 31:20.713
She gets to breathe,
your boss gets her paperwork.

31:20.838 --> 31:22.423
Whose idea was that?

31:23.508 --> 31:24.968
It was a joint decision.

31:25.677 --> 31:27.595
It never is.

31:29.013 --> 31:31.683
So, how old were you
when your brother left home?

31:31.808 --> 31:34.894
- Why do you think that I...
- Why aren't you answering?

31:35.144 --> 31:37.105
Did your mother
initiate the divorce?

31:37.230 --> 31:39.440
We should probably focus
on what's wrong with her lungs.

31:39.566 --> 31:40.525
Are you Wiccan?

31:40.650 --> 31:42.360
She really can't breathe.

31:43.570 --> 31:45.405
Okay. Hold still.

31:49.033 --> 31:49.909
What are you doing?

31:50.034 --> 31:51.995
Auscultatory percussion.

31:52.120 --> 31:54.205
If you have
a good ear, you can...

31:57.333 --> 31:59.085
You didn't have a lot of friends,
because you chose not to...

31:59.210 --> 32:01.087
You can hear
while you're talking?

32:02.005 --> 32:07.093
You can detect not only structural
details, but small, deep masses.

32:12.974 --> 32:14.601
Game's over.

32:15.643 --> 32:19.022
You either have lung cancer
or tuberous sclerosis.

32:20.273 --> 32:22.442
We need to cut
you open and biopsy.

32:23.610 --> 32:24.819
That'll

32:26.070 --> 32:27.447
leave a scar.

32:27.572 --> 32:30.074
NASA doctors will see it.
They'll know.

32:30.742 --> 32:34.621
I never opened for Springsteen
or slept with Barbara Feldon.

32:34.746 --> 32:37.874
You can live for years without dreams.
Without lungs...

32:37.999 --> 32:39.459
Find a way.

32:42.378 --> 32:43.796
Okay-

32:43.921 --> 32:47.675
As long as you keep saying it strongly,
you won't die.

32:49.677 --> 32:52.764
Find a way.

32:57.894 --> 33:00.813
How do we force
a patient into surgery?

33:01.564 --> 33:05.068
Texas bag scam?
Saratoga Wire?

33:05.193 --> 33:06.778
Paris Exposition Trick?

33:06.903 --> 33:09.197
The problem's not the surgery,
it's the scars,

33:09.322 --> 33:11.658
and we have a plastic surgeon
here who can hide them.

33:11.783 --> 33:14.869
Not that well. NASA's gonna
check every cranny.

33:14.994 --> 33:17.622
I say we just put ether in her oxygen
and do what we have to do.

33:17.747 --> 33:18.790
She'll sue.

33:18.915 --> 33:19.832
For what?

33:19.957 --> 33:22.794
Making it harder for her
to lie to the government?

33:22.919 --> 33:24.671
We don't need to hide them.

33:24.796 --> 33:27.215
We give her elective
cosmetic surgery.

33:27.340 --> 33:29.550
The incisions will give us
access to her lungs.

33:29.676 --> 33:32.220
And she's got an innocent
explanation for the scars.

33:32.345 --> 33:34.055
You mean, like, liposuction.

33:34.180 --> 33:37.225
No, no. Those incisions
are too far from the lungs.

33:37.350 --> 33:40.311
We don't subtract. We add.

33:41.354 --> 33:43.606
Turn her Bs into Cs.

33:44.732 --> 33:49.570
It's myth that fake hooters blow up
at high altitude. She'll be fine.

33:50.947 --> 33:54.283
Just think of it as
one giant rack for mankind.

33:55.076 --> 33:57.662
I fought for years
to be taken seriously.

33:57.787 --> 34:01.124
Trust me, you'll be taken
more seriously. Just sign the form.

34:02.792 --> 34:04.544
This'll make me a joke.

34:04.669 --> 34:05.962
There's gotta be another way.

34:10.174 --> 34:13.094
I've known a few people
who had dreams.

34:13.219 --> 34:17.557
One thing they all had in common
was they got laughed at

34:18.850 --> 34:21.185
and they didn't care.

34:31.738 --> 34:34.157
You bumped a splenectomy
for a boob job?

34:34.282 --> 34:35.992
Would you condemn
this woman to a life

34:36.117 --> 34:38.327
where people look at her face
when they talk to her?

34:38.453 --> 34:40.872
If you don't explain this,
I'll cancel the surgery.

34:40.997 --> 34:43.082
Can I explain
why you're here?

34:43.207 --> 34:44.876
I think I just
told you why I...

34:45.001 --> 34:49.589
I scheduled a diagnostic patient
for a boob job. Which is ridiculous.

34:49.714 --> 34:51.299
So, obviously you
had to confront me.

34:51.424 --> 34:52.633
With you so far.

34:52.759 --> 34:53.843
But I'm gonna
give you a reason.

34:53.968 --> 34:55.094
Not a good one.

34:55.219 --> 34:57.430
No. Not even close
to a good one.

34:58.890 --> 35:01.184
But here's the drag
from your point of view.

35:01.309 --> 35:03.436
My explanation
will make sense.

35:03.561 --> 35:06.689
Not to the board,
not to a judge, but to you.

35:06.814 --> 35:08.900
So you'll let me do it.

35:09.025 --> 35:12.820
Then, you're gonna have to sit next
to me at the administrative hearing.

35:13.946 --> 35:16.407
Don't you have
better things to do?

35:25.792 --> 35:28.836
It's in the best
interests of the patient.

35:33.216 --> 35:35.760
Trocar's in,
you're good to go.

35:42.558 --> 35:44.393
Deflate the lung.

35:45.353 --> 35:47.230
ASHKA: There, a cyst.

35:47.688 --> 35:49.857
TAUB: Cysts,
I count three of them.

35:49.982 --> 35:53.277
Probably the same, if not more,
on the left lung.

35:53.402 --> 35:58.074
Okay, so what's been working overtime
to kill Miss Bin Laden?

35:58.199 --> 35:59.784
ASHKA: We know her name now.

35:59.909 --> 36:01.577
Yeah, but I forgot it.

36:01.702 --> 36:05.039
Say the magic word and get immunity
from the next challenge.

36:05.164 --> 36:07.792
Alveolar hydatid disease.
Hits all the organs.

36:07.917 --> 36:09.710
She'd have had multiple
seizures by now.

36:09.836 --> 36:11.212
Pulmonary Langerhans'.

36:11.337 --> 36:13.339
Doesn't explain
the red blood cells.

36:14.257 --> 36:15.383
Come on!

36:15.508 --> 36:18.594
Cysts, synesthesia, heart attack.
You guys have gotta...

36:18.719 --> 36:20.805
<i>CHASE:
Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome.</i>

36:22.348 --> 36:25.810
<i>Raises red blood cell count,
causes masses on the organs.</i>

36:25.935 --> 36:28.563
<i>If one of the masses
is a pheochromocytoma,</i>

36:28.688 --> 36:31.566
<i>it could cause neurologic episodes
and a heart attack.</i>

36:36.195 --> 36:40.741
Do you see a blonde guy who still has
peach fuzz standing up there?

36:41.909 --> 36:43.160
Yeah.

36:43.828 --> 36:47.123
This is a closed procedure.
Gallery's off limits.

36:47.707 --> 36:49.000
<i>Not to the surgical staff.</i>

36:51.252 --> 36:53.629
Are you gonna hire
that guy instead of us?

37:02.305 --> 37:04.849
Not a chance.
I love you guys.

37:05.850 --> 37:09.729
Please dig out the cysts,
histology to confirm Von Hippel-Lindau.

37:09.854 --> 37:12.064
Don't forget her chesticles.

37:21.657 --> 37:24.410
Calling Arizona was
a very nice touch.

37:24.535 --> 37:25.745
You do have residual...

37:25.870 --> 37:28.122
Not only do I not
have residual feelings,

37:28.247 --> 37:29.790
I didn't even have
primary feelings.

37:29.916 --> 37:31.167
- You freaked...
- You lied!

37:31.292 --> 37:32.627
Because you knew it meant...

37:32.752 --> 37:34.003
It meant nothing!

37:34.128 --> 37:36.589
I saw him
'cause he was there.

37:36.714 --> 37:39.425
Did Cameron follow her bashert
to the surgery department?

37:39.550 --> 37:41.135
I think Chase
followed her.

37:41.260 --> 37:43.638
She's been a senior attending in the ER
the last three weeks.

37:43.763 --> 37:46.474
A blonde senior attending,
to be accurate.

37:46.599 --> 37:48.559
And Foreman,
is he back in neurology?

37:48.684 --> 37:51.646
He's at New York Mercy.
He's been there a month.

37:51.771 --> 37:54.815
- Did you see Foreman?
- No.

37:54.941 --> 37:58.402
<i>WOMAN OVER PA: Doctor Chang to OR.
Doctor Chang to OR.</i>

37:59.570 --> 38:02.073
So, I'm cured.

38:02.198 --> 38:05.034
You're fine for now, but
Von Hippel-Lindau is a genetic disease.

38:05.159 --> 38:06.577
There's no cure.

38:07.495 --> 38:10.539
Greta, you need to
come clean to NASA.

38:11.415 --> 38:13.250
You said you
got all the cysts.

38:13.376 --> 38:14.794
They could re-emerge.

38:15.836 --> 38:17.380
I'll go to radiology clinics.

38:17.505 --> 38:19.006
I'll get regular
screenings.

38:19.131 --> 38:21.425
If something happened
while you're up there,

38:21.550 --> 38:22.677
you'd be playing
Russian Roulette with...

38:22.802 --> 38:23.886
HOUSE: Relax.

38:25.596 --> 38:27.807
She doesn't have to tell,
and neither do you.

38:29.141 --> 38:30.977
Turns out the NASA doctors even know

38:31.102 --> 38:33.396
where the hyphen
in Von Hippel-Lindau goes.

38:35.272 --> 38:36.899
You called them?

38:37.483 --> 38:38.901
I'm not an idiot.

38:39.402 --> 38:41.529
Those shuttles fly over New Jersey.

38:53.165 --> 38:56.335
HOUSE: So, here we are.
The big moment!

38:56.460 --> 39:00.214
Which of you gets to live
to be abused another day?

39:00.339 --> 39:03.259
And which of you goes home
and rationalizes being fired

39:03.384 --> 39:05.302
as character building?

39:10.891 --> 39:12.476
The following numbers,
thanks for playing.

39:12.601 --> 39:17.481
21, 19, 8, 34,

39:17.857 --> 39:19.400
17,

39:19.859 --> 39:21.861
29, 5,

39:22.445 --> 39:24.822
36, 2.

39:26.282 --> 39:28.409
The rest of you,
8 a.m. sharp.

39:28.534 --> 39:31.203
I'll be in sometime
between 10:00 and 3:00.

39:31.328 --> 39:33.539
Oh, and 26,
stick around a while.

39:38.961 --> 39:40.838
I did nothing wrong.

39:41.088 --> 39:42.590
Lots of people did nothing wrong.

39:42.715 --> 39:44.383
Other people screwed up,
I never even...

39:44.508 --> 39:46.594
Other people took chances.

39:47.386 --> 39:48.846
26?

39:52.725 --> 39:54.226
Buddy Ebsen actually was allergic to...

39:54.351 --> 39:56.687
Yeah, I know.
How old are you?

39:56.812 --> 39:58.147
21.

39:58.272 --> 40:00.191
You don't think it's relevant.

40:00.316 --> 40:02.693
I'll likely have less time to use
the skills you teach us,

40:02.818 --> 40:04.612
but I don't think
that's significant to you.

40:04.737 --> 40:07.490
How about the fact that you
never went to medical school?

40:09.033 --> 40:12.244
Which is why you let
the unlucky number do the trans echo.

40:13.621 --> 40:16.290
At least you're
ethically unethical.

40:18.667 --> 40:22.588
30 years I worked in the
Columbia med school admissions office.

40:22.713 --> 40:26.509
Audited all the classes,
most of them, more than once.

40:27.927 --> 40:29.678
I just never got a diploma.

40:30.721 --> 40:32.723
You had to know I'd
find out sooner or later.

40:35.017 --> 40:36.519
I know you break rules.

40:37.436 --> 40:39.271
I thought maybe
you'd break one for me.

40:40.731 --> 40:41.857
(SIGHS)

40:41.982 --> 40:43.734
I can't hire you as a doctor.

40:44.527 --> 40:46.821
But you can still
tell me what you think.

40:46.946 --> 40:49.615
You could also fetch me coffee
and pick up my dry cleaning.

40:49.740 --> 40:52.076
Until I can decide
whether or not to keep you.

40:52.201 --> 40:56.163
So, I'm playing this whole game
to be, like, your secretary?

40:56.288 --> 40:59.083
Assistant sounds marginally
less demeaning.

40:59.750 --> 41:01.585
It's not my dream job.

41:01.710 --> 41:05.965
Actually, it is.
It's just not your dream title.

41:31.615 --> 41:33.159
Three weeks.

41:33.284 --> 41:36.912
For someone who never misses something
small, you missed something big.

41:38.831 --> 41:40.124
You're an idiot.

41:40.791 --> 41:43.210
The hair, where I'm working,
or both?

41:43.335 --> 41:45.546
The hair makes you
look like a hooker.

41:46.005 --> 41:47.756
I like it.

41:48.632 --> 41:51.051
Pulling pieces of windshield
out of car accident victims,

41:51.177 --> 41:54.555
and reattaching fingertips
sliced off cutting bagels?

41:55.014 --> 41:58.100
At least Chase's move
is only one step down.

41:58.225 --> 42:00.603
I can do good here.
Get it out of my system.

42:04.398 --> 42:06.650
Why'd you rat your
patient out to NASA?

42:07.568 --> 42:10.321
I don't know who's been gossiping
about ethics instead of sex,

42:10.446 --> 42:12.072
but I hope they've
already been fired.

42:13.115 --> 42:15.075
- Which number was it?
- Greta.

42:15.201 --> 42:17.536
- Number.
- No number, the patient.

42:17.661 --> 42:19.121
How do you think she got
your pager number?

42:19.246 --> 42:21.040
She came into the ER,
didn't want to talk...

42:21.165 --> 42:22.082
I didn't rat her out.

42:22.208 --> 42:24.043
You lied?

42:24.543 --> 42:27.588
I suppose I should tell her
that before she keys my car.

42:27.713 --> 42:29.173
Why lie?

42:29.298 --> 42:31.800
I had to stop some leaky faucets.

42:32.551 --> 42:33.886
What did it matter?

42:34.929 --> 42:36.222
It was no one's business.

42:37.556 --> 42:38.641
Right.

42:38.766 --> 42:40.935
She's gonna be
the safest astronaut up there.

42:41.769 --> 42:44.313
Certainly more vigilant than the guy
next to her who's got no clue

42:44.438 --> 42:46.607
about the aneurysm
in his head ready to pop.

42:46.732 --> 42:48.108
Right.

42:49.485 --> 42:51.362
You got a better reason?

42:54.406 --> 42:56.450
You couldn't kill her dream.
