WEBVTT

00:06.040 --> 00:09.960
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:17.080 --> 00:20.680
6 MONTHS EARLIER

01:39.000 --> 01:42.320
If you can't have anything from me

01:43.920 --> 01:46.800
I don't know why you chase me

01:48.280 --> 01:50.960
All the time, on the street

01:55.640 --> 01:58.400
You know that I'm married

01:59.960 --> 02:02.560
That I'm a devoted wife

02:03.760 --> 02:07.000
And that I can't be yours

02:11.080 --> 02:14.600
Just because you're rich and elegant

02:15.800 --> 02:19.200
You want me to be your lover

02:20.000 --> 02:23.400
Out of a whim or arrogance

02:28.920 --> 02:30.640
I thought that was you.

02:32.320 --> 02:33.360
May I?

02:34.560 --> 02:35.760
Have a seat.

02:41.840 --> 02:45.360
Fado and blues have a lot in common.

02:46.320 --> 02:49.640
They both have a certain sadness

02:49.720 --> 02:52.920
that only the poor
and the exploited can express.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.160
I would never have imagined
you coming here.

02:55.720 --> 02:59.200
This crowd is more fun
than the one that goes to São Carlos.

02:59.720 --> 03:01.800
-Silence.
-Sorry.

03:03.560 --> 03:05.280
Fado is being sung.

03:06.840 --> 03:09.240
Fátima, football, and fado.

03:09.760 --> 03:12.080
The Holy Trinity of the regime.

03:19.080 --> 03:21.560
Why don't we go
and have a drink somewhere else?

03:21.640 --> 03:22.920
I'm buying.

03:29.800 --> 03:30.840
Probably for the best.

03:30.920 --> 03:34.680
I won't sell

03:35.880 --> 03:40.040
Or give myself

03:40.120 --> 03:43.840
I already gave away all that I am

03:43.920 --> 03:47.440
To a love you don't know

03:50.120 --> 03:52.240
It's not just the war. It's everything.

03:52.960 --> 03:57.040
We are proud to be alone, as Salazar says.
But less and less by choice.

03:58.040 --> 04:00.600
Don't let your father hear you
say something like that.

04:00.680 --> 04:04.840
We are burying
an entire generation in Africa, Alexandre.

04:06.240 --> 04:08.560
You must have seen a lot
while you were there.

04:12.960 --> 04:14.240
The empire…

04:15.440 --> 04:16.480
the empire…

04:19.360 --> 04:20.440
it will fall.

04:21.160 --> 04:22.920
It's inevitable.

04:29.160 --> 04:32.200
I was face-to-face with the man
who killed Martin Luther King today.

04:36.880 --> 04:38.640
His name is James Earl Ray.

04:40.240 --> 04:41.480
And he's in Lisbon.

04:46.360 --> 04:48.000
How did you know it was him?

04:49.440 --> 04:52.360
PIDE is watching him,
but they won't do anything.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.360
I thought about killing him.

04:57.320 --> 04:59.560
What if you killed an innocent man?

05:10.040 --> 05:11.680
It wouldn't be the first time.

05:12.240 --> 05:14.840
In the war, you kill so you don't die.
It's different.

05:19.640 --> 05:24.160
What about you, Alexandre? You could be
living in any country in Europe.

05:24.800 --> 05:26.080
Why Portugal?

05:28.400 --> 05:30.720
My parents were supporters of the tsar,

05:30.800 --> 05:33.120
and after the communist revolution,
we had to run.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.480
From Finland, we went to France.

05:36.520 --> 05:39.160
And when the war started,
we had to come here.

05:39.240 --> 05:41.600
Do you think you'll be able
to go back to Russia?

05:42.160 --> 05:43.440
Russia?

05:44.680 --> 05:46.320
Russia doesn't exist anymore.

05:48.240 --> 05:51.240
And if you ask me,
it will probably never exist again.

05:55.720 --> 05:59.320
Can I tell you a secret?

06:02.160 --> 06:05.440
My family lived
in the memories of the past.

06:07.040 --> 06:09.200
And the more I heard those stories…

06:11.280 --> 06:14.920
the more sense it made to me
that the people started a revolution.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.240
Now I'm the one warning you
not to tell that story to my father.

06:18.320 --> 06:19.520
João…

06:21.640 --> 06:25.200
I know that you've been going
to the Portuguese Communist Party meetings

06:25.280 --> 06:27.000
since you got back from the war.

06:32.080 --> 06:33.160
Minister,

06:34.040 --> 06:37.640
if I had a son,
I would also prefer to know the truth.

06:39.960 --> 06:43.080
Especially since this could have
consequences for you.

06:44.120 --> 06:45.320
If it's true.

06:45.920 --> 06:47.880
Rumors are equally dangerous.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.560
More dangerous, even.

06:51.200 --> 06:53.760
Doubt always lingers.

06:55.280 --> 06:58.880
And as we know,
people always prefer to believe the worst.

07:00.760 --> 07:02.960
What you told me
is enough for an investigation,

07:03.040 --> 07:06.240
but at this stage, we should keep it
just between the two of us.

07:07.320 --> 07:11.880
If my son is working with the Communists,
I want to sign the arrest warrant myself.

07:13.280 --> 07:16.080
I'm sorry to bring you this news.

07:17.720 --> 07:19.200
But I'm just doing my job.

07:20.600 --> 07:22.920
How will I ever thank you?

07:23.440 --> 07:26.120
There's no need. There's no need at all.

07:27.320 --> 07:29.720
Your friendship is enough for me.

07:34.480 --> 07:35.600
Sofia?

07:37.120 --> 07:38.320
Sofia?

07:43.240 --> 07:44.160
Sofia?

11:28.040 --> 11:30.040
That fucking American is a bastard.

11:32.640 --> 11:35.120
What do you say we have dinner tonight?

11:35.800 --> 11:38.840
The usual guys, Hernâni, Bernardino.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.000
Count me in.

11:41.640 --> 11:42.800
Great.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.200
Connect me.

11:57.120 --> 11:58.160
Is it done?

12:02.800 --> 12:03.720
Hello?

12:04.520 --> 12:05.680
Hello, can you hear me?

12:06.480 --> 12:07.600
It's Ramiro.

12:08.480 --> 12:09.920
So how is my father-in-law?

12:10.520 --> 12:11.600
Me too.

12:11.680 --> 12:12.600
Beat it.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.160
Has Sofia arrived yet?

12:20.480 --> 12:21.480
She hasn't?

12:22.480 --> 12:23.640
She didn't call you?

12:24.680 --> 12:27.560
You're not lying to me, are you?

12:29.200 --> 12:31.440
Nothing. We're fine.

12:32.480 --> 12:35.280
She's just a little more sensitive,
given the pregnancy.

12:36.080 --> 12:39.640
Yes… No. No, we didn't fight.

12:40.480 --> 12:42.240
Is that what she told you?

12:45.440 --> 12:49.800
Listen, if Sofia is there,
please ask her to talk to me.

12:52.200 --> 12:53.040
Fine.

12:54.400 --> 12:57.080
I'm coming over tomorrow.
You tell her that.

12:57.760 --> 13:00.960
I'm coming over tomorrow.
I won't leave until she talks to me.

13:16.760 --> 13:18.720
I never meant to hurt you, Carolina.

14:59.400 --> 15:00.560
Graham Hill.

15:00.640 --> 15:02.320
-Graham Hill?
-Graham Hill! Trust me.

15:02.400 --> 15:05.680
No, listen. This year,
in the Formula One Championship,

15:05.760 --> 15:08.040
Jackie Stewart won seven out of eleven…

15:08.120 --> 15:10.480
-Are you crazy?
-He'll win it again next year.

15:10.560 --> 15:11.400
Graham Hill.

15:11.480 --> 15:12.800
-Wanna bet?
-Yes.

15:12.880 --> 15:14.400
-Should we bet?
-Yes.

15:14.480 --> 15:17.640
-What does the winner get? A ham?
-Didn't Gonçalo say he was coming?

16:25.000 --> 16:26.840
-Hello?
-Hello, sir.

16:26.920 --> 16:29.640
This is Gonçalo Ribeiro.
I found something you'll want to see.

16:29.720 --> 16:31.280
What did you find?

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
Recordings.

16:33.880 --> 16:35.200
Of the Americans.

16:35.280 --> 16:38.960
I found the tapes
when I searched the house.

16:40.560 --> 16:41.920
When can we meet?

16:42.000 --> 16:43.920
How about tonight, at your office?

16:44.000 --> 16:45.320
No, not at the ministry.

16:46.520 --> 16:49.680
We'll meet at Estrela Garden at 10:00 p.m.

16:50.200 --> 16:54.000
-Of course.
-And, Gonçalo, keep a low profile.

16:54.080 --> 16:56.120
Of course. You can trust me to do that.

16:57.720 --> 16:58.720
Thank you.

17:47.040 --> 17:49.040
Hello? Jaime?

17:53.560 --> 17:57.360
FERNANDO MARCELINO STREET
COLONIAL WAR HERO

18:05.400 --> 18:06.880
I don't think I was a hero.

18:09.640 --> 18:10.800
Take the tribute.

18:11.440 --> 18:13.200
Many didn't survive the war.

18:21.440 --> 18:22.520
-Afternoon.
-Afternoon.

18:40.400 --> 18:42.280
You should call it a night.

18:42.800 --> 18:44.040
I'm fine.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.560
Go to bed. Tomorrow is a new day.

21:34.520 --> 21:37.400
Gentlemen, I work for the services.
Just let me get my ID.

21:38.080 --> 21:39.000
Shut up.

21:42.600 --> 21:43.800
Stop!

21:43.880 --> 21:46.400
-I'm here to meet someone.
-And these reels?

21:47.880 --> 21:49.760
Call Minister Henrique Vidal, please.

21:49.840 --> 21:51.840
Right. We've spoken to the minister.

21:51.920 --> 21:52.920
You have?

21:55.560 --> 21:57.720
It was his son. He made these recordings.

21:57.800 --> 21:59.240
-Recordings of--
-Shut up!

21:59.320 --> 22:00.880
-Take them!
-Get in and shut up!

22:00.960 --> 22:04.040
Recordings of the Americans.
He was going to give them to Communists.

22:04.120 --> 22:07.000
-Please listen to me.
-You'd better shut up, you hear me?

22:13.400 --> 22:14.240
Vidal.

22:15.600 --> 22:16.520
What is this?

22:18.600 --> 22:19.680
Get in the car.

22:33.400 --> 22:34.800
We're going to the dam.

23:08.360 --> 23:09.640
Why did you kill her?

23:10.800 --> 23:11.640
Mia.

23:11.720 --> 23:13.120
It wasn't me.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.360
She worked for the Russians.

23:16.880 --> 23:19.280
If anyone killed her,
it was the CIA, or even PIDE.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.640
Sofia and Mia were friends.

23:26.160 --> 23:31.200
I heard from Parker
that you arrived in Berlin two days late.

23:33.560 --> 23:36.000
I suspected that Sofia was cheating on me,

23:36.520 --> 23:39.320
so I stayed to see
if I could catch her with her lover.

24:18.520 --> 24:20.600
-You recorded all of this?
-Never.

24:23.920 --> 24:25.440
Did you plan to blackmail me?

24:26.440 --> 24:27.680
Ramiro and me?

24:28.360 --> 24:29.760
I destroyed everything.

24:53.120 --> 24:54.920
-Mia, careful.
-Calm down.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.560
-Sofia. What's going on here?
-Don't come any closer.

24:57.640 --> 24:59.400
-Sofia, don't move.
-Let go of my wife.

24:59.480 --> 25:01.360
-Calm down.
-Let go of my wife.

25:01.440 --> 25:04.000
-Calm down.
-Mia, be careful with him. Mia!

25:04.600 --> 25:06.680
-Get in the car now!
-Be careful!

25:08.520 --> 25:10.200
What are you doing, Mia?

25:10.720 --> 25:12.840
-Stop. What are you doing?
-He won't hurt you.

25:12.920 --> 25:14.840
-He won't hurt you. Calm down.
-Stop.

25:14.920 --> 25:16.400
Be careful.

25:17.360 --> 25:19.080
Mia? Mia…

25:20.400 --> 25:21.240
Mia.

25:22.560 --> 25:24.080
Sofia, let's go.

25:24.160 --> 25:27.720
Mia! What did you do, Ramiro? Mia!

25:27.800 --> 25:30.160
Mia! What have you done, Ramiro?

25:30.240 --> 25:32.720
-Sofia…
-Let go of me! Mia!

25:33.320 --> 25:34.280
Let's go home!

25:34.880 --> 25:35.840
Let go of me!

25:35.920 --> 25:38.240
-She got what was coming to her.
-Get out!

25:39.320 --> 25:40.280
Get out of the car!

25:48.760 --> 25:49.600
My wife?

27:27.120 --> 27:29.240
It's been a while
since someone like this showed up.

27:30.880 --> 27:32.240
Can he be trusted?

27:33.080 --> 27:33.960
Completely.

27:38.920 --> 27:42.640
We haven't heard this piece
since the evening I recruited you.

27:45.680 --> 27:47.880
So Mia's death was a crime of passion?

27:49.120 --> 27:51.840
An ordinary crime, for love.

27:52.840 --> 27:54.360
Love is never ordinary.

27:56.560 --> 28:00.120
Almost everything we do in life
is motivated by that feeling.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.520
There were problems with the explosives.

28:06.080 --> 28:06.960
I heard.

28:08.440 --> 28:10.880
Roberto and Ermelinda were with us?

28:11.760 --> 28:12.800
She was, yes.

28:13.600 --> 28:17.000
One of our people got caught
and couldn't stand the torture--

28:17.080 --> 28:19.000
Can PIDE get to us?

28:19.080 --> 28:20.160
No.

28:21.680 --> 28:23.520
We will continue with the plan.

28:24.920 --> 28:28.560
Salazar always had doubts
about having a base in Portugal.

28:30.080 --> 28:34.040
If the Americans bring us more problems,
they will be asked to leave.

28:34.560 --> 28:37.960
That's why I don't want you
to put the explosives on the antennas.

28:38.480 --> 28:40.160
I want them inside RARET.

28:43.360 --> 28:46.360
Let's stick to the original plan.
There's no need for people to die.

28:46.440 --> 28:50.520
When you chop wood, chips fly.

28:50.600 --> 28:53.760
I won't kill people I know,
people that are innocent.

28:53.840 --> 28:56.000
No one is innocent, João.

29:06.280 --> 29:08.840
That was fantastic, Alcina. Thank you.

29:09.800 --> 29:11.560
Thank you, my dear boy.

29:11.640 --> 29:14.200
-I'll bring the coffee right away.
-Thank you, Alcina.

29:14.720 --> 29:16.040
Your father told me

29:16.120 --> 29:19.240
that some RARET employees
were killed in an explosion.

29:19.320 --> 29:20.600
It was a car accident.

29:20.680 --> 29:21.880
No, it wasn't.

29:22.880 --> 29:24.920
I heard your father on the phone.

29:25.000 --> 29:28.200
PIDE and the Americans
are investigating everyone.

29:28.720 --> 29:32.080
Quite frankly, I doubt they were
from the Communist Party at all.

29:32.600 --> 29:35.640
There were explosives in the car, João.

29:35.720 --> 29:37.400
I have no explanation for that.

29:37.480 --> 29:40.440
Your father is convinced
it was meant to be a distraction tactic.

29:41.040 --> 29:43.880
-A distraction tactic?
-Yes. That's what I heard.

29:44.480 --> 29:46.920
But I don't know why they think that.

29:47.560 --> 29:49.160
Thank you, Alcina.

29:49.240 --> 29:52.560
I forgot my cigarettes.
Will Dad have some in his office?

29:52.640 --> 29:54.320
Yes, he probably does.

29:55.280 --> 29:56.480
Excuse me.

30:42.360 --> 30:43.320
Hello?

30:45.240 --> 30:46.080
João?

30:47.120 --> 30:48.000
How are you?

30:48.520 --> 30:50.520
No, you're not bothering me.

30:50.600 --> 30:52.680
You're lucky you got ahold of me.

30:55.040 --> 30:56.960
Yes, your father told me about it.

30:58.800 --> 31:00.400
Who are you investigating?

31:03.240 --> 31:04.320
Yes, you can come over.

31:04.840 --> 31:07.320
I'll give you the permission needed
to access the file.

31:08.800 --> 31:10.800
Very well, then. Great talking to you.

31:11.320 --> 31:12.720
Send my best to your father.

31:12.800 --> 31:14.400
I will.

31:18.840 --> 31:19.880
Did you find them?

31:21.400 --> 31:24.120
Cigarillos. But they'll do.

31:56.240 --> 31:57.440
I can't.

32:11.640 --> 32:12.680
Fernando…

32:13.760 --> 32:15.200
I'm going for a smoke.

32:38.720 --> 32:40.120
Does my foot bother you?

32:40.640 --> 32:42.040
Fernando…

32:44.160 --> 32:45.720
What's that?

32:48.440 --> 32:50.840
I bought it from a guy
who was with me on the plane.

32:51.720 --> 32:55.040
It's 6.35 mm. Made by the Communists--

32:55.120 --> 32:57.720
Is it loaded? Put it away.

32:59.720 --> 33:01.920
What's the point
of having an unloaded gun?

33:04.920 --> 33:07.760
In Africa, it crossed my mind
to end it all, you know?

33:09.840 --> 33:12.320
The only reason
I didn't blow my brains out was you.

33:20.160 --> 33:22.520
If you leave me,
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

33:23.160 --> 33:24.240
It's okay.

33:27.600 --> 33:29.280
I'm right here, Fernando.

33:37.200 --> 33:38.360
I'm right here.

33:41.920 --> 33:43.560
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

33:43.640 --> 33:44.720
Would you like a chair?

33:44.800 --> 33:46.880
Maybe you'd be
more comfortable in an office?

33:46.960 --> 33:48.400
No, there's no need.

33:48.480 --> 33:51.160
All right, then.
I'll be in the archives if you need me.

33:56.760 --> 33:58.760
CONFIDENTIAL
MINISTRY OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS

34:02.160 --> 34:03.280
SANTARÉM EXPLOSIVES FILE

34:03.360 --> 34:06.200
The explosives were activated
by a device, triggered beforehand

34:06.280 --> 34:09.640
so the device could not be seized
and the agents could not be interrogated.

34:22.080 --> 34:23.880
DEFENDANTS

34:31.960 --> 34:33.240
Just a moment.

34:41.720 --> 34:42.560
Thank you.

34:50.920 --> 34:52.560
-Hello?
-Sir?

34:54.160 --> 34:58.000
Sorry to bother you, but I thought
you should be the first to know.

34:59.840 --> 35:04.360
Ramiro and Sofia
were found dead at the dam.

37:24.880 --> 37:27.480
I thought we didn't have
anything else to discuss.

37:29.440 --> 37:31.600
When will the new antenna be ready?

37:31.680 --> 37:32.840
It shouldn't be long now.

37:32.920 --> 37:36.640
James told me that the Russians
have given you more and more trouble,

37:36.720 --> 37:38.520
always blocking the signal.

37:38.600 --> 37:40.960
It's a cat and mouse game.

37:41.040 --> 37:43.960
And what are you? The mouse or the cat?

37:45.360 --> 37:47.120
Or both at the same time?

37:54.440 --> 37:55.840
I feel like walking.

38:08.720 --> 38:10.200
Who recruited you?

38:13.800 --> 38:15.240
So what happens now?

38:16.640 --> 38:18.520
You will leave for Brazil tomorrow.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.560
What will be the official version?

38:22.080 --> 38:25.680
You'll take care of some business
that your mother's family has over there.

38:27.080 --> 38:28.600
-And what then?
-What then?

38:28.680 --> 38:31.480
I hope you'll forget all about politics.
Or disappear.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.560
Make something up, an accident.

38:34.080 --> 38:37.320
The KGB is great at making stories up.

39:24.440 --> 39:29.160
I was going to take
the reels to Minister Henrique.

39:32.160 --> 39:36.720
Every time you insult the minister,
that is going to happen.

39:36.800 --> 39:40.160
I didn't do it.
What do you want me to say?

39:41.600 --> 39:42.760
That it was you.

39:49.840 --> 39:52.320
Come on. We just need your signature.

39:52.960 --> 39:54.640
We'll prepare the confession.

40:15.520 --> 40:17.600
I just signed it!
What are you gonna do to me?

40:17.680 --> 40:19.880
Leave me alone, please! I just signed it!

40:20.600 --> 40:22.160
Let me go!

44:12.600 --> 44:14.160
We can go now.
