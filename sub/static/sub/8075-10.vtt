figure out how to work this.

00:09.977 --> 00:11.879
Yep, well, here
let me show you.

00:11.912 --> 00:12.880
ROSEANNE: Dan, don't crowd me.

00:12.913 --> 00:14.915
I'm trying to turn it on.

00:14.948 --> 00:16.117
It is on.

00:16.150 --> 00:17.385
ROSEANNE: No, it's off.

00:17.418 --> 00:18.586
Look, now it's--

00:20.854 --> 00:21.722
OK.

00:21.755 --> 00:23.291
Hi, it's me.

00:23.324 --> 00:24.458
I'm your mom.

And here's you.

time capsule to be

00:31.232 --> 00:32.933
So today you're 16.

00:32.966 --> 00:37.805
And you either have really
long hair that's over your eyes

00:37.838 --> 00:39.740
or you're totally
bald and tattooed,

00:39.773 --> 00:41.809
whatever the thing it
is that will make me

00:41.842 --> 00:42.910

00:45.679 --> 00:47.881
I cannot even imagine
the stuff that you'll see

00:47.915 --> 00:50.284
in your lifetime, because
I saw unbelievable

00:50.318 --> 00:51.585
things in my lifetime.

00:51.619 --> 00:54.054
I saw people
walking on the moon.

00:54.088 --> 00:59.127
I saw a woman run
for vice president,

00:59.160 --> 01:04.332
the fall of communism, and
Michael Jackson marry Lisa

01:04.365 --> 01:07.335

event that will

01:07.368 --> 01:10.104

02:21.141 --> 02:25.379
I think this is like
about her 150th lifetime.

02:25.413 --> 02:28.216
She really has the power to
totally change the world if she

02:28.249 --> 02:30.083
can figure out how to
turn her negative crap

02:30.117 --> 02:31.685
into positive crap.

02:34.355 --> 02:37.325
She is the first person on
either side of our family

02:37.358 --> 02:39.927
ever to go to college,
which is incredible.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.895
I always thought it would be
Becky, though, because Becky

02:41.929 --> 02:42.963
is the one who had the grades.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.365
She had the straight
A's and everything.

falls in love with a guy

- No.

Hey, I can cook.

Now, Mark, when
you say cook, do you

03:30.544 --> 03:34.882
mean cook or put ragu on bread?

03:34.915 --> 03:36.116
Ooh, that sounds good.

while, the boxes will decay,

all over my body.

fitted for ski boots.

- Why?

06:19.079 --> 06:20.280
Is that odd?

06:20.313 --> 06:28.121
No, no, yeah, no, yeah,
no, not at all, not odd, no.

06:30.824 --> 06:31.625
Yes.

06:34.995 --> 06:36.930
Dan, Fred is skiing.

06:36.964 --> 06:38.599
Why the hell is Fred skiing?

06:38.632 --> 06:40.634
- To get down the hill faster.
- No.

06:40.668 --> 06:42.135
No.
No.

06:42.169 --> 06:43.036
It doesn't make sense.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.472
See, Fred is dull.

06:44.505 --> 06:46.574
When we were together, I
begged him to try skiing.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.709
You know what his
exact words to me were?

06:48.742 --> 06:49.843
Can't talk now.

06:49.877 --> 06:53.380
I'm pressing my slacks.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.415
I do not want to get
in the middle of this.

06:55.449 --> 06:59.987
Ah, so there's a this to
get in the middle of, huh?

07:00.020 --> 07:02.923
Oh, I get it.

07:02.956 --> 07:06.527
Oh, how pathetic.

07:06.560 --> 07:09.329
See, Jackie, I'm doing
stuff that you're like now.

07:09.362 --> 07:10.498
I'm skiing.

07:10.531 --> 07:11.932
I'm interesting.

07:11.965 --> 07:13.901
And that's supposed to make
me want to take him back.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.302
That's what it
is, isn't it, Dan?

07:15.335 --> 07:16.203
Huh?

07:16.236 --> 07:18.539
Huh?

07:18.572 --> 07:21.208
I'm going to go get a beer.

07:21.241 --> 07:23.777
Enjoy your tour of the galaxy.

07:23.811 --> 07:27.447
Yeah, well, you're not
saying that I'm wrong, are you?

07:27.481 --> 07:32.820
OK, I will take your
silence as a no.

07:32.853 --> 07:35.589
Thank you very much.

07:35.623 --> 07:37.791
Your dad works really hard.

07:37.825 --> 07:41.662
He always wanted to give
you guys everything.

07:41.695 --> 07:47.434
But over the years, I guess,
his dreams kind of fell down,

07:47.467 --> 07:50.003
one right after the other.

07:50.037 --> 07:51.505
But now, he's
working for the city,

07:51.539 --> 07:53.440
which is great because
you cannot be fired

07:53.473 --> 07:55.876
for any reason
whatsoever, you know,

07:55.909 --> 07:57.945
just like being in Congress.

07:57.978 --> 08:01.348
And I do have to say,
though, that no matter how

08:01.381 --> 08:03.617
hard he works, I've
always worked harder.

08:03.651 --> 08:09.623
I have worked, whether your
dad was laid up or laid off.

08:09.657 --> 08:11.191
I'm the one that
brought home the bacon.

08:11.224 --> 08:12.325
I cooked it up myself.

08:12.359 --> 08:15.128
And yeah, sure, I took
a few bites off the top.

08:15.162 --> 08:18.666
I figure I can reward
myself some way.

08:18.699 --> 08:21.501
And I have never complained
in my entire life.

08:21.535 --> 08:22.636
I've never complained.

08:22.670 --> 08:26.774
And I have never ever
asked anybody for help,

08:26.807 --> 08:28.275
because, you know,
even if I did,

08:28.308 --> 08:31.278
it's not like anybody would
lift a finger to help me anyway.

08:31.311 --> 08:33.647
You know there's a lot
of cool stuff in here.

08:33.681 --> 08:36.750
Hey, DJ, you ever seen the
TV Guide from before cable?

08:36.784 --> 08:40.554
Wow skinny.

08:40.588 --> 08:42.455
What are these?

08:42.489 --> 08:46.894
Oh, man, Becky and
Darlene's baby books.

08:46.927 --> 08:49.129
Look, there's Darlene's
first tooth-- careful, DJ,

08:49.162 --> 08:50.898
that is razor sharp.

08:50.931 --> 08:53.634
Cool is my baby book in here?

08:53.667 --> 08:56.036
Oh, it's probably
out in the garage.

08:56.069 --> 08:58.105
Great, I'm going
to go find it.

08:58.138 --> 08:59.707
OK, son, you do that.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.675
David, I'm going to
need your help here.

09:01.709 --> 09:02.676
Doing what?

09:02.710 --> 09:05.779
Making out DJ's baby book.

09:05.813 --> 09:06.947
Mr. Conner.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.081
It was 1981.

09:08.115 --> 09:11.084
I was still hung up on
the Bicentennial thing.

09:11.118 --> 09:16.323
OK, date of birth, middle name.

09:16.356 --> 09:18.425
We'll get back to that.

09:18.458 --> 09:19.259
Lock of hair.

09:23.130 --> 09:26.667
Too thick and greasy.

09:26.700 --> 09:30.337
Too course and manly.

09:30.370 --> 09:31.171
Too much like carpet.

09:47.520 --> 09:48.622
What?

09:48.656 --> 09:51.792
Has anyone ever told
you you have nice hair?

09:51.825 --> 09:53.260
Man, Andy was hungry.

09:53.293 --> 09:55.095
Andy, duh.

09:55.128 --> 09:57.430
Get the scissors.

09:57.464 --> 09:58.331
Hi, Jackie.

10:04.738 --> 10:11.378
So, Mark, Mark, Bobark.

You And.

10:12.312 --> 10:13.814

10:13.847 --> 10:15.949
Has he told you about
his little plan yet?

10:15.983 --> 10:19.386
His little Jackie likes
to ski so I'm going

10:19.419 --> 10:21.321
to ski to get her back plan?

10:21.354 --> 10:22.622
Oh, Fred's going skiing?

10:22.656 --> 10:26.093
I guess it got too cold for
him to go rock climbing.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.696
Wait, he's rock climbing, too?

10:28.729 --> 10:30.197
I don't like rock climbing.

10:30.230 --> 10:31.999
Why is he rock climbing?

10:32.032 --> 10:33.433
Why are you rock climbing?

10:33.466 --> 10:34.467
I don't like rock climbing.

10:34.501 --> 10:36.069
So you're doing it
doesn't impress me.

10:36.103 --> 10:37.705
So why do it?

10:37.738 --> 10:40.140
I wasn't doing
it to impress you.

10:40.173 --> 10:44.177
Then why the sudden
interest in skiing, mister--

10:44.211 --> 10:49.850

who's a skier guy.

10:49.883 --> 10:51.752

10:51.785 --> 10:53.453
Jean-Claude Killy, that's it.

10:53.486 --> 10:56.824
Jean-Claude Killy.

10:56.857 --> 10:59.426
Jackie, you know, I can
do things for me, too.

10:59.459 --> 11:00.861
I can go skiing.

11:00.894 --> 11:02.629
I can go rock climbing.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.798
I can be in a play.

11:04.832 --> 11:05.866
You are in a play?

11:05.899 --> 11:07.100
Yes.

11:07.134 --> 11:08.668
What the hell gives you
the right to be interesting.

11:08.702 --> 11:10.303
You were the one who
was always telling me

11:10.337 --> 11:11.839
that I should be more active.

11:11.872 --> 11:13.373
Yeah, before when
we were together.

11:13.406 --> 11:14.775
Doesn't do me any good now.

11:14.808 --> 11:15.943
Change back.

11:15.976 --> 11:17.978
Change back.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.280
Good bye, Jackie.

11:20.313 --> 11:21.548
You've lost your mind.

11:21.581 --> 11:24.351
Oh, so now you're
a psychiatrist.

11:24.384 --> 11:28.321
Look there goes Fred,
the skiing psychiatrist.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.824
[music playing]

11:35.262 --> 11:37.865
Me and your Aunt
Jackie are really close.

11:37.898 --> 11:40.801
We're about as close
as two sisters can be.

11:40.834 --> 11:42.435
But it is kind of funny
how life works out,

11:42.469 --> 11:45.538
because in high school,
she was the one that had

11:45.572 --> 11:46.774
all these boyfriends, you know.

11:46.807 --> 11:48.508
And I never had any boyfriends.

11:48.541 --> 11:51.912
But now, I'm the one that's
been married for 23 years,

11:51.945 --> 11:58.752
and Aunt Jackie just barely
got a divorce, which is sad.

11:58.786 --> 12:00.720
And I'm sure that her
little Andy is going to grow

12:00.754 --> 12:01.955
up to be some big old flamer--

12:05.458 --> 12:07.327
well, which isn't a bad thing.

12:07.360 --> 12:10.630
I mean, gay people
are cool, you know.

12:10.663 --> 12:14.234
They're just as good and
just as bad as other people.

12:14.267 --> 12:18.538
You might be gay yourself.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.040
So I want you to know
that there's nothing

12:20.073 --> 12:22.442
that you could ever do
or say or be that would

12:22.475 --> 12:24.444
make us not love you.

12:24.477 --> 12:27.114
Roseanne, Roseanne,
my name is Dan.

12:27.147 --> 12:29.817
I really want to be your man.

12:29.850 --> 12:32.886
Please say yes or
I'll be a mess.

12:32.920 --> 12:35.222
Leave your answer in my dess.

12:38.959 --> 12:41.128
Are you listening?

12:41.161 --> 12:42.495
Becky?

12:42.529 --> 12:44.898
Darlene, you've got to
read what Mom wrote here.

12:44.932 --> 12:46.733
It's really incredible.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.201
Wow.

12:48.235 --> 12:51.604
Hey, where's Dad?

12:51.638 --> 12:52.572
Dad, I'm going to--

12:52.605 --> 12:54.107
DJ, you slow down.

12:54.141 --> 12:55.375
Running is very dangerous.

12:55.408 --> 12:57.811
Now, you get back out
there and you walk in here.

12:57.845 --> 12:59.646
Go, go, go, go.

13:06.419 --> 13:07.487
Baby's footprint, done.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.156
I think that's everything.

13:09.189 --> 13:10.858
We're horrible frauds.

13:10.891 --> 13:12.993
Cool, thanks, David.

13:13.026 --> 13:13.894
DJ, good news.

13:13.927 --> 13:14.828
We found your book.

13:14.862 --> 13:16.196
It was in this box
the whole time.

13:16.229 --> 13:17.364
How about that?

13:17.397 --> 13:19.266
Oh, great, let me see.

13:22.302 --> 13:25.172
Hey, look, it's my first tooth.

13:25.205 --> 13:29.509
Ew, and it's all
sticky and minty.

13:29.542 --> 13:31.478
Well, it's a real good
reason for that, DJ.

13:31.511 --> 13:32.645
You see that particular tooth--

13:32.679 --> 13:36.383
Is a Tic Tac.

13:36.416 --> 13:38.351
Oh, that's right it is.

13:38.385 --> 13:39.752
That's right.

13:39.786 --> 13:41.254
That's right.

13:41.288 --> 13:44.624
You see, your real tooth--
there's quite a story here.

13:47.694 --> 13:50.197
Oh, my god, you've
got your mother's stare.

13:52.832 --> 13:58.738
OK, DJ, look, we made
the whole thing up.

13:58.771 --> 14:03.276
I'm sorry, we never did
keep a baby book for you.

14:03.310 --> 14:04.344
I mean you were the third kid.

14:04.377 --> 14:05.778
That happens sometimes.

14:05.812 --> 14:07.881
I'm really, really sorry.

14:07.915 --> 14:09.316
But it doesn't mean
we love you any less.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.783
I hope you know that.

14:10.817 --> 14:13.453
None of this was my idea, DJ.

14:13.486 --> 14:14.521
Come on DJ.

14:14.554 --> 14:16.256
I'll make it up to you.

14:16.289 --> 14:19.126
We can do some
father son things.

14:19.159 --> 14:20.493
You know any?

14:20.527 --> 14:22.862
Why don't you
just finish my book?

14:22.896 --> 14:24.564
Really?

14:24.597 --> 14:25.698
Yeah.

14:25.732 --> 14:28.969
Just write like what I
was like when I was two.

14:29.002 --> 14:32.372
Just kind of leverage,
I mean, just starting

14:32.405 --> 14:33.506
to put sentences together.

14:33.540 --> 14:34.341
Do better.

14:37.110 --> 14:39.112
Much smarter than
either of his sisters.

14:39.146 --> 14:42.415
Oh, right.

14:42.449 --> 14:44.651
Has x-ray eyes.

14:44.684 --> 14:45.618
Food.

14:45.652 --> 14:46.453
Now.

14:49.056 --> 14:51.124
All right, let's
get this over with.

14:51.158 --> 14:53.226
The pizza place
closes at 9:00, which

14:53.260 --> 14:55.095
doesn't give me much
time to eat this, puke,

14:55.128 --> 14:57.064
and then drive there.

14:57.097 --> 14:58.999
Hey, you knock it off.

14:59.032 --> 15:00.533
Yeah, leave Mark alone.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.469
This looks good.

15:02.502 --> 15:05.905
Dad, can I go to
bed without supper?

15:05.939 --> 15:06.940
No.

15:06.974 --> 15:07.840
Please?

15:07.874 --> 15:12.079
I smoked a cigarette today.

15:12.112 --> 15:15.015
I wish we had a dog.

15:15.048 --> 15:17.884
Maybe we did.

15:17.917 --> 15:18.785
All right, that's it.

15:18.818 --> 15:19.819
Dinner is over.

15:19.852 --> 15:21.388
You know, I worked
really hard in this.

15:21.421 --> 15:24.224
And all you people do is sit
around and make fun of me.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.825
Mark, Mark, bring
the plates back.

15:25.858 --> 15:27.060
We're sorry.

15:27.094 --> 15:29.329
Sorry only counts in horse
shoes and hand grenades.

15:35.068 --> 15:37.870
You guys are unbelievable.

15:37.904 --> 15:40.640
Mark really tried to make a
good dinner for you people

15:40.673 --> 15:42.575
and you just make fun of him.

15:42.609 --> 15:45.545
Well, I guess that's what passes
for thank you in this family.

15:50.650 --> 15:51.884
I feel really bad.

15:51.918 --> 15:52.785
Oh, yeah?

15:52.819 --> 15:53.686
Wait 10 minutes.

15:58.858 --> 16:02.562
Oh, my god.

16:02.595 --> 16:04.264
They're eating it.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.432
Really?

16:05.465 --> 16:07.834
Yeah, look for yourself.

16:07.867 --> 16:10.070
Oh, my god, they are.

16:10.103 --> 16:12.372
Suckers.

16:12.405 --> 16:17.177
It serves them right,
ragging on you all day.

16:17.210 --> 16:19.212
What is in that junk anyway?

16:19.246 --> 16:20.647
Well, lots of
stuff, but I think

16:20.680 --> 16:22.482
it's the Jergens that
they're really responding to.

16:27.687 --> 16:28.855
You didn't finish, Dad.

16:28.888 --> 16:29.689
Get back here.

16:36.896 --> 16:40.100
Teach you to
smoke a cigarette.

16:40.133 --> 16:43.236
If you're going in to eat, may
I suggest a few of these first.

16:43.270 --> 16:48.608
No, Dan, alcohol isn't
the answer to everything.

16:48.641 --> 16:51.010
Whoa, it's about the
whole Fred thing, isn't it?

16:51.044 --> 16:52.612
No, sit down.
Please, Dan.

16:52.645 --> 16:53.513
It's not about Fred.

16:53.546 --> 16:56.983
It's about me-- and Fred.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.286
Oh, my stomach hurts.
I can't get up.

16:59.319 --> 17:00.553
What?

17:00.587 --> 17:03.723
It's just that Fred has
suddenly gotten so interesting.

17:03.756 --> 17:05.158
And I've become so boring.

17:05.192 --> 17:06.526
And it's not fair, you know.

17:06.559 --> 17:07.727
I want to do stuff too.

17:07.760 --> 17:10.930
But I have to spend all
my time being a mother.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.468
Could you give Fred the
baby more hours a week?

17:15.502 --> 17:17.270
No, I don't want to do.

17:17.304 --> 17:19.272
Cut back on your
hours of work?

17:19.306 --> 17:21.908
I can't afford to do that.

17:21.941 --> 17:23.876
Take the baby and
move in with your mom?

17:23.910 --> 17:25.878
OK, that was just plain mean.

17:25.912 --> 17:27.514
Well, Jackie, I don't know.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.249
I'm out of ideas.

17:29.282 --> 17:31.017
You shot down all
my suggestions.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.686
You've rejected
alcohol out of hand.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.021
Oh, I know.

17:35.054 --> 17:38.591
It's just that I want to do
things, like ski and stuff.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.660
And I can't because I have Andy.

17:40.693 --> 17:43.630
And then I know it
sounds horrible.

17:43.663 --> 17:45.665
But I feel cheated.

17:45.698 --> 17:48.034
And then that makes me feel
all guilty because it's

17:48.067 --> 17:53.873
not little Andy's fault. It's
nobody's fault. I'm just stuck.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.209
I'm just-- I'm stuck.

17:56.243 --> 17:57.744
And I'm alone.

17:57.777 --> 18:00.280
And I don't know what to do.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.081
Roseanne and I are
always here for you.

18:02.115 --> 18:04.083
Well, yeah, I know.

18:04.117 --> 18:06.719
[baby crying]

18:06.753 --> 18:07.620
Oh, relax.

18:07.654 --> 18:09.021
I'll get him.

18:15.962 --> 18:17.530
ROSEANNE: Dan, get in here.

18:17.564 --> 18:19.766
It's your turn to
talk to the kid.

18:22.802 --> 18:25.972
It's not always
going to be like this.

18:26.005 --> 18:27.106
We will be here for you.

18:27.140 --> 18:28.241
I know, Dan.

18:28.275 --> 18:29.142
Thanks.

18:29.176 --> 18:30.109
It's OK.

18:30.143 --> 18:32.345
It's OK, sweetie.

18:32.379 --> 18:34.714
It's all right.

18:34.747 --> 18:36.683
Everything's OK.

18:36.716 --> 18:38.117
Oh, honey, shh.

18:46.593 --> 18:49.162
OK, I'm going to give your
dad a turn to talk to you now,

18:49.196 --> 18:51.831
but before I go, I want
to tell you one thing.

18:51.864 --> 18:54.234
You know that we had
you late in our lives,

18:54.267 --> 18:57.103
but we really wanted you.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.938
And that's basically
because you're

18:58.971 --> 19:01.941
our last hope for a good
retirement, which is totally

19:01.974 --> 19:04.544
going to happen, because
after all these years,

19:04.577 --> 19:06.746
I finally figured out how to
raise a kid that will grow

19:06.779 --> 19:08.981
up to be incredibly successful.

19:09.015 --> 19:11.318
And that is every
time you turn around,

19:11.351 --> 19:17.690
you tell them how wonderful they
are and how beautiful they are

19:17.724 --> 19:22.595
and how priceless they are
and how much they are loved.

19:22.629 --> 19:23.696
And you are.

19:23.730 --> 19:26.499
[music playing]

19:32.339 --> 19:34.541
Hi, I'm DJ, your
older brother.

19:34.574 --> 19:37.076
By the time you see this, I'll
have mustache because I just

19:37.109 --> 19:38.110
sent away for it.

19:40.913 --> 19:42.148
This is your cousin Andy.

19:42.181 --> 19:45.218
And he's going to show
you how smart he is.

19:45.252 --> 19:50.657
Honey, honey, honey,
where's mommy's nose?

19:50.690 --> 19:51.958
Where's mommy's nose?

19:51.991 --> 19:53.326
Huh?

19:53.360 --> 19:55.495
He's usually really
good at this.

19:55.528 --> 19:56.763
Honey.

19:56.796 --> 19:58.465
Honey, where's mommy's nose?

20:03.936 --> 20:05.838
Hey, Sis.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.674
OK, mom and dad don't
know we found this.

20:07.707 --> 20:11.711
So this is just
between us, all right?

20:11.744 --> 20:16.749
Dear Dan, we're getting
married tomorrow.

20:16.783 --> 20:19.652
As cool it is that you're
going to be my husband.

20:19.686 --> 20:20.953
It's even cooler
that you're going

20:20.987 --> 20:24.591
to be the father of my
children because I really

20:24.624 --> 20:26.693
want our family to be
different from the families we

20:26.726 --> 20:28.528
grew up in.

20:28.561 --> 20:31.631
Our kids are going to get
a better shot than that.

20:31.664 --> 20:33.199
We're going to make sure
they know that they're

20:33.232 --> 20:37.504
worth something, and that no
matter what they do, no matter

20:37.537 --> 20:41.641
how mad they make us, or
how bad they screw up,

20:41.674 --> 20:44.977
they can always come home.

20:45.011 --> 20:46.979
Pretty nice letter, huh?

20:47.013 --> 20:48.548
Still, watch your back.

20:51.684 --> 20:52.552
No.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.186
Come on, you can find it.

20:54.220 --> 20:57.189
He's so close.

20:57.223 --> 20:58.090
Honey.

20:58.124 --> 20:58.925
Honey.

21:02.161 --> 21:03.029
Hi.

21:03.062 --> 21:05.632
It's me, your dad.

21:05.665 --> 21:08.034
I went out and get this
baby book for you today.

21:08.067 --> 21:10.503
I'm going to fill it all out
for you and stay on top of it.

21:10.537 --> 21:15.107
I already put your
sonogram picture in there.

21:15.141 --> 21:17.243
That's you.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.311
You look real pretty.

21:18.345 --> 21:19.979
You get your
mother's eye sockets.

21:24.250 --> 21:25.318
I can't wait to meet you.

21:28.220 --> 21:29.422
ROSEANNE: Your
grandmother really,

21:29.456 --> 21:33.393
really wanted to be on this
tape, so go ahead, Mom.

21:33.426 --> 21:35.628
Thank you, Roseanne.

21:35.662 --> 21:37.096
Hello.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.466
Hello, little grand--

21:39.499 --> 21:40.367
Trust me.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.335
That was enough.

21:42.369 --> 21:44.471
So I'll see you in a few weeks.

21:44.504 --> 21:45.304
Can't wait.

21:48.240 --> 21:52.278
ROSEANNE: What do you got to do
to get some dinner around here.
