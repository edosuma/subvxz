WEBVTT

00:01.540 --> 00:03.670
Previously on "How to Get Away
With Murder"...

00:03.670 --> 00:04.670
Did Laurel tell you she got

00:04.670 --> 00:05.620
a creepy call from
a mouth-breather?

00:05.620 --> 00:06.460
She thinks
it was her mother.

00:06.460 --> 00:07.330
What did
Christopher see?

00:07.330 --> 00:08.080
I don't think
he saw anything.

00:08.080 --> 00:09.120
You don't think?!

00:09.120 --> 00:10.210
We're prepared
to offer you

00:10.210 --> 00:11.580
complete immunity,
Ms. Keating.

00:11.580 --> 00:13.420
They're now saying
they have to take my laptop.

00:13.420 --> 00:14.580
I'd feel
more comfortable

00:14.580 --> 00:16.420
if I was reassigned
to a new agent.

00:16.420 --> 00:17.920
I'm gonna have to
take you off Bonfire

00:17.920 --> 00:19.580
until further notice.

00:19.580 --> 00:21.250
Agent Telesco: This is FBI
Special Agent Claire Telesco.

00:21.250 --> 00:23.000
This is Laurel Castillo.
Call me back.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.750
Dr. Groff: When Officer Gladden
uncuffed the inmate,

00:25.750 --> 00:28.120
Mr. Lahey then reached
for her gun.

00:28.120 --> 00:30.040
I have a present
for you.

00:30.040 --> 00:31.540
From your father,
really.

00:31.540 --> 00:34.380
Thought you would like
to know how proud he was.

00:34.380 --> 00:35.750
It's late.

00:35.750 --> 00:36.670
Yeah, I'll go.

00:36.670 --> 00:38.290
I know who killed
Nate Senior.

00:38.290 --> 00:39.540
Emmett Crawford.

00:52.920 --> 00:54.710
Are we sure these
are Emmett's phone records?

00:54.710 --> 00:56.750
I'm not sure of anything
anymore.
I'm just saying.

00:56.750 --> 00:58.250
This is the same Governor
who played you before.

00:58.250 --> 01:00.620
Like I need you
to remind me.

01:00.620 --> 01:02.420
Okay, look at the time.

01:02.420 --> 01:06.000
Emmett called the female guard
just minutes after I quit C&G.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.920
Nate Senior was dead
two hours later.

01:07.920 --> 01:09.380
You don't kill a man

01:09.380 --> 01:10.580
because you're pissed
your employee quit.

01:10.580 --> 01:12.330
You do if you want
to destroy me.

01:12.330 --> 01:14.080
Or Birkhead's
made this all up.

01:14.080 --> 01:15.830
That's why
I invited you here --

01:15.830 --> 01:17.250
so you could tell me
who to believe.

01:18.620 --> 01:20.000
I can't tell you that.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.420
But I can tell you
Emmett Crawford is not a man

01:22.420 --> 01:24.000
who goes around
ordering hits on people.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.250
We don't know him.

01:25.250 --> 01:26.330
We don't know
the Governor either.

01:26.330 --> 01:27.960
I didn't invite the Governor
to my home,

01:27.960 --> 01:29.750
introduce her to my mom.

01:29.750 --> 01:31.420
Being polite to a lonely man
on Christmas

01:31.420 --> 01:32.460
doesn't make you a fool.

01:32.460 --> 01:34.080
I almost kissed him.

01:36.420 --> 01:38.210
You had already left.
I wasn't even drunk.

01:38.210 --> 01:39.750
I just...

01:39.750 --> 01:42.000
I needed something.
He was there.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.880
Well, there's your answer.

01:43.880 --> 01:46.120
That man's into you,
Annalise.

01:46.120 --> 01:48.920
Just the whiff of sex
will lower his defenses.

01:48.920 --> 01:50.500
So you're telling me
to play the whore?

01:50.500 --> 01:52.830
I'm telling you to use the gifts
your mamma gave you.

01:54.290 --> 01:56.210
Or drive yourself crazy
with not knowing.

02:18.790 --> 02:20.670
Can we talk?

02:20.670 --> 02:22.250
Of course.

02:22.250 --> 02:24.790
Let me again say thank you
so much for Christmas.

02:24.790 --> 02:27.460
Oh, that's exactly what I wanted
to talk to you about.

02:29.120 --> 02:30.750
About that, uh,
it was just a moment.

02:30.750 --> 02:32.620
You don't have to worry.

02:32.620 --> 02:33.710
I'm not worried.

02:35.080 --> 02:37.120
I-I just mean we can pretend
it never happened.

02:38.580 --> 02:40.210
What if I wanted it
to happen?

02:43.330 --> 02:45.210
Annalise, I --
I've already had

02:45.210 --> 02:48.250
one misconduct crisis
at this firm.

02:49.460 --> 02:52.250
So the board is why
you're saying no?

02:52.250 --> 02:54.620
No, please don't take this
as a no.

02:54.620 --> 02:56.920
Are you sure there's not
another reason?

03:00.500 --> 03:03.170
I'm attracted to you,
if that's what you mean.

03:03.170 --> 03:04.380
It wasn't.

03:06.250 --> 03:08.790
I just think it's best if
we keep this professional.

03:11.460 --> 03:13.380
I get it.

03:13.380 --> 03:16.500
You can't stop being
this firm's good little boy.

03:43.920 --> 03:45.790
BonBon.

03:45.790 --> 03:47.250
Hello to you, too.

03:47.250 --> 03:49.500
Everyone in here, including you,
Oliver!

03:49.500 --> 03:51.080
We have a project.

03:51.080 --> 03:52.920
So do we --
studying for our midterms.

03:52.920 --> 03:55.080
Yeah, or did you forget that
we're still hoping to graduate

03:55.080 --> 03:57.210
at the end of the year?
You won't get
the chance to graduate

03:57.210 --> 03:58.750
unless we get
Oliver's laptop back.

03:58.750 --> 04:00.250
Uh, I told you.
It's encrypted.

04:00.250 --> 04:02.040
Asher: And didn't Telesco
get suspended?

04:02.040 --> 04:04.750
She isn't the only FBI officer
investigating Miller's case.

04:04.750 --> 04:07.040
We have to write up a motion
to get the laptop back.

04:07.040 --> 04:09.580
I'm thinking we focus on 4th
Amendment violations to start.

04:09.580 --> 04:10.830
And let's be quick.

04:10.830 --> 04:12.290
I can only be out of the office
a few hours.

04:12.290 --> 04:14.380
BonBon back in charge.
I like it.

04:14.380 --> 04:15.710
Where's Laurel?

04:15.710 --> 04:18.210
Uh, Christopher has a check-up
at the pediatrician.

04:28.040 --> 04:29.170
Agent Telesco:
Ms. Castillo.

04:29.170 --> 04:30.960
You brought your baby.

04:30.960 --> 04:32.500
Christopher.

04:32.500 --> 04:33.750
Cute.

04:35.880 --> 04:37.670
You were vague on the phone.

04:37.670 --> 04:39.580
I assume this is about
the Miller investigation?

04:42.420 --> 04:44.750
No.

04:44.750 --> 04:48.620
Someone keeps calling me from
a blocked number and hanging up.

04:48.620 --> 04:50.920
You called me because you're
getting prank phone calls?

04:50.920 --> 04:52.120
I think it's my mother.

04:52.120 --> 04:54.380
I think she's trying to
warn me about something.

04:54.380 --> 04:56.420
What does this have to do
with the FBI?

04:56.420 --> 04:59.250
I haven't heard from her
since my father was arrested.

04:59.250 --> 05:01.250
I assumed you put her
in Witness Protection.

05:01.250 --> 05:02.710
You're making a lot
of assumptions here.

05:02.710 --> 05:05.210
I'm a mother. I have to assume
the worst to protect my son.

05:07.880 --> 05:10.330
I can find out who's calling

05:10.330 --> 05:12.920
and offer you and your son
protection,

05:12.920 --> 05:14.580
but I need information
in return.

05:15.790 --> 05:16.750
About my father?

05:16.750 --> 05:18.290
Your father's in prison.

05:18.290 --> 05:19.830
I'm more interested
in people you know

05:19.830 --> 05:22.500
who also deserve to be in prison
for crimes currently unsolved.

05:24.290 --> 05:25.710
I don't know what
you're talking about.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.120
You do.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.500
So talk,

05:31.500 --> 05:33.210
and perhaps I can get you
the same immunity deal

05:33.210 --> 05:34.620
your professor wanted.

05:38.500 --> 05:40.040
Clearly you need time
to think about it.

05:41.290 --> 05:42.750
Stay safe, little guy.

05:57.380 --> 05:59.080
What is that?

05:59.080 --> 06:00.960
I didn't want to tell you
until I knew it was true.

06:00.960 --> 06:02.210
Just show me, Annalise.

06:05.330 --> 06:06.750
Emmett called Paula Gladden

06:06.750 --> 06:08.210
on the night your father
was killed.

06:08.210 --> 06:09.540
And they were talking
weeks before,

06:09.540 --> 06:10.750
like they
were planning it.

06:13.880 --> 06:14.750
Who gave you this?

06:15.830 --> 06:16.880
The Governor.

06:19.620 --> 06:21.330
I know.

06:21.330 --> 06:23.620
She's doing exactly
what I'd do in her position.

06:23.620 --> 06:26.040
She's framing the only other
person she can think of --

06:26.040 --> 06:27.460
Or she's telling the truth.

06:29.670 --> 06:32.120
Pops' letters to your mom.

06:32.120 --> 06:34.670
"Yesterday some slick lawyer
visited,

06:34.670 --> 06:38.500
said he wanted me to fire
Annalise and hire him.

06:38.500 --> 06:40.210
I sent his sorry ass packing,
of course."

06:43.500 --> 06:45.420
Both: Emmett.

06:45.420 --> 06:46.710
Who else?

06:58.420 --> 07:02.290
You sure these are all
the visitors from that week?

07:02.290 --> 07:03.830
Everyone who signed in,
at least.

07:05.330 --> 07:06.380
Then get me
the security footage.

07:06.380 --> 07:08.210
I don't have access to that.

07:08.210 --> 07:09.670
And honestly,
I just need my money.

07:09.670 --> 07:10.790
What if I can get you
more money?

07:10.790 --> 07:12.000
I've done all I can, Nate.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.620
Name your price.

07:17.670 --> 07:19.420
How much?!
You're the one making all

07:19.420 --> 07:21.580
that blood money
from the firm.

07:21.580 --> 07:24.170
Fine. But he only gets paid
when he delivers.

07:26.790 --> 07:28.960
-Talk later.

07:30.290 --> 07:31.580
There's no clinic
during break -- you know that.

07:32.750 --> 07:35.580
My mom wants to visit me
this weekend.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.670
But she still thinks
I'm in Virginia.
What?

07:37.670 --> 07:39.920
I never told her
I transferred from UVA.

07:39.920 --> 07:42.040
Why are you telling me this?

07:42.040 --> 07:44.750
Because it involves you.
No, it involves you.

07:44.750 --> 07:46.210
You made the decision
to come here.

07:46.210 --> 07:47.670
You made the decision
to lie to her.

07:47.670 --> 07:48.880
What --

07:48.880 --> 07:50.960
I-I thought I was being
considerate coming to you.

07:50.960 --> 07:52.540
No, you came to me
because you wanted me

07:52.540 --> 07:54.330
to tell you what to do.

07:54.330 --> 07:55.750
I already saved your ass
from federal prison,

07:55.750 --> 07:57.170
so my work is done.

07:58.620 --> 08:02.080
Fine. Fine, I'll just --
I'll just tell her the truth.

08:02.080 --> 08:03.830
So just be ready when
she shows up at your door.

08:03.830 --> 08:05.580
Tell her the truth and she goes
back to snorting pills.

08:05.580 --> 08:06.710
You want that?

08:13.290 --> 08:15.080
Look, I...

08:15.080 --> 08:18.250
I'm just really confused
right now.

08:18.250 --> 08:20.830
I feel alone.
It's called adulthood,
Gabriel.

08:20.830 --> 08:24.290
Every single one of us
is alone all the time.

08:24.290 --> 08:26.670
Accept it now and you'll save
yourself a lot of pain later.

08:28.080 --> 08:29.750
Thanks for the advice.

08:36.290 --> 08:38.790
What horrible thing are you
about to ask me to do?

08:38.790 --> 08:41.000
Gabriel's mother
wants to visit.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.790
Obviously, that's not
what any of us want.

08:43.790 --> 08:46.500
Can't he just lie to her, say
he's buried studying for exams?

08:46.500 --> 08:49.210
See, you're already thinking
two steps ahead.

08:49.210 --> 08:52.580
Go to his place, make sure
he stops her visit.

08:52.580 --> 08:54.920
You mean go to his place
and use my boobs again.

08:54.920 --> 08:56.920
I want you to use your mind,
Michaela,

08:56.920 --> 08:58.290
just like you did
with Simon.

08:58.290 --> 08:59.880
You hated what
I did with Simon.

08:59.880 --> 09:00.960
And we haven't heard
from him since.

09:00.960 --> 09:02.170
Clearly, I was wrong.

09:03.750 --> 09:06.460
Don't look at me like
I've never said that before.

09:06.460 --> 09:08.420
You only say that when you're
trying to manipulate us.

09:12.670 --> 09:14.620
Look at me.

09:14.620 --> 09:15.790
Right now.

09:18.830 --> 09:20.290
I'm dealing
with a mess right now

09:20.290 --> 09:22.170
that makes me
want to cash out my savings

09:22.170 --> 09:24.830
and take a plane somewhere
none of you know exists.

09:26.380 --> 09:29.120
What is going on?

09:29.120 --> 09:31.460
Consider it a gift that
I'm not telling you.

09:39.290 --> 09:41.790
What's up?
Annalise's midterm
is in a week,

09:41.790 --> 09:44.790
and my roommates
don't care.
Makes sense.

09:44.790 --> 09:47.000
Annalise will probably
pass you all anyway.
Not true.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.540
But if you don't want
a study partner

09:48.540 --> 09:51.250
who consistently ranks
in the top 5% of her class,

09:51.250 --> 09:53.380
I'll let you figure
it out on your own.

09:53.380 --> 09:56.250
You're not gonna plant
another nanny cam, are you?

09:56.250 --> 09:58.040
I wouldn't even know
how to do that.

10:08.670 --> 10:10.880
Bet you didn't know
cars could fly.

10:10.880 --> 10:15.170
Well, they can't, but they will
when you're old enough to drive.

10:15.170 --> 10:16.750
He's really turned a corner
with his eye tracking.

10:16.750 --> 10:19.000
Laurel: Was Annalise gonna take
immunity from the FBI?

10:22.830 --> 10:24.500
Where'd you hear that?

10:24.500 --> 10:26.540
From her. She said she was gonna
talk to the FBI.

10:26.540 --> 10:28.040
It's obvious.

10:28.040 --> 10:29.710
Ah, they just wanted to
question her about Miller.

10:29.710 --> 10:31.170
And everything else.

10:31.170 --> 10:34.750
Look, Tegan got Telesco
suspended, so stop stressing.

10:34.750 --> 10:36.420
It's gonna rub off
on Christopher.

10:36.420 --> 10:37.670
Yeah, you mean more
than the wedding?

10:38.920 --> 10:40.790
Look at the guy.

10:40.790 --> 10:42.330
He's thriving, Laurel.

10:42.330 --> 10:43.500
Yeah, well, I'm not.

10:43.500 --> 10:44.920
Maybe that's because you
haven't forgiven Bonnie.

10:44.920 --> 10:46.790
Stop --
I'm serious.

10:48.040 --> 10:50.040
She's in a bad place.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.420
I'm not saying
that's on you.

10:53.170 --> 10:56.040
But I know she hates herself
for what happened.

10:56.040 --> 10:57.830
And that you talking to her

10:57.830 --> 11:00.170
and forgiving her

11:00.170 --> 11:01.830
could be the thing
that keeps her alive.

11:05.420 --> 11:08.460
Can you help me find out why
my mother is calling me?

11:08.460 --> 11:09.460
If she's calling --

11:09.460 --> 11:10.960
It's her.

11:10.960 --> 11:12.170
I know you think
I'm paranoid,

11:12.170 --> 11:14.170
but my father was never
just gonna sit in prison.

11:14.170 --> 11:16.250
I need to protect
Christopher.

11:16.250 --> 11:17.540
Why don't you get that?

11:18.790 --> 11:20.670
I'll call Otis.

11:20.670 --> 11:21.880
Thank you.

11:26.670 --> 11:28.790
Bonnie: "Special Agent Telesco
was recently exposed

11:28.790 --> 11:30.790
as committing misconduct,

11:30.790 --> 11:32.620
specifically planting
false evidence..."

11:32.620 --> 11:34.540
"...in the case
United States v. Maddox."

11:34.540 --> 11:36.500
"It's also come
to our attention

11:36.500 --> 11:39.000
that Agent Telesco engaged
in romantic relations

11:39.000 --> 11:40.420
with an FBI informant."

11:40.420 --> 11:41.500
Don't put that in.
We can't know that.

11:41.500 --> 11:42.670
Hey.

11:45.290 --> 11:46.120
Why are you here?

11:47.460 --> 11:49.670
Uh, we're getting
Oli's laptop back.

11:49.670 --> 11:51.500
How was the check-up?

11:51.500 --> 11:53.170
Fine.

11:53.170 --> 11:54.500
Do we think
it's smart to keep

11:54.500 --> 11:56.250
taking shots
at Telesco in court?

11:56.250 --> 11:57.710
Isn't that just like
poking the bear?

11:57.710 --> 11:58.960
Well, she's on probation.

11:58.960 --> 12:00.500
It's our best argument
for the motion.

12:04.960 --> 12:07.710
Okay, we are all proofed.

12:07.710 --> 12:11.040
Only thing left is, who's gonna
be Oli's attorney?

12:11.040 --> 12:13.750
Put Oliver.
He'll represent himself.

12:13.750 --> 12:15.620
What?
Seriously, no.

12:15.620 --> 12:17.500
I'll prep you.
You'll be fine.

12:17.500 --> 12:19.120
Okay.

12:19.120 --> 12:22.540
I mean, I guess I've watched
Annalise enough in court,

12:22.540 --> 12:24.750
and I did do musical theater
in high school.

12:24.750 --> 12:26.210
Why don't I do it?

12:26.210 --> 12:28.750
You need to be supervised
by a licensed attorney.

12:28.750 --> 12:31.040
I'm Oliver's husband.
I can be co-plaintiff.

12:31.040 --> 12:32.250
We'll just say that
the computer contains

12:32.250 --> 12:33.330
my personal
information, too.

12:33.330 --> 12:34.460
But it doesn't.

12:34.460 --> 12:36.380
Look, this isn't some
fender-bender case.

12:36.380 --> 12:39.790
We need to stack the deck
as best as we can here.

12:39.790 --> 12:42.420
Good. Add Connor and file it
with the judge right away.

12:42.420 --> 12:43.460
On it.

12:50.380 --> 12:51.710
Danielle said
you needed me?

12:51.710 --> 12:52.790
Come in.

12:55.080 --> 12:56.170
Please.

12:57.880 --> 13:00.120
So, how are you?

13:02.080 --> 13:03.670
Okay, you know me --
straight shooter.

13:03.670 --> 13:05.000
So if there's something
I've done wrong --

13:05.000 --> 13:06.500
That's for you to tell me.

13:09.960 --> 13:13.460
A few weeks ago, I.T. alerted me
to an e-mail you received

13:13.460 --> 13:16.710
in which you were referred
to as "Jane Doe."

13:16.710 --> 13:18.500
I never confronted
you about it

13:18.500 --> 13:20.080
because I didn't want
to believe it was true.

13:22.120 --> 13:24.330
Is it?
No.

13:24.330 --> 13:27.580
I think whoever sent that e-mail
was trying to frame me.

13:27.580 --> 13:28.880
Who would do that?

13:28.880 --> 13:31.540
That's what I can't
figure out.

13:31.540 --> 13:34.210
But Sandrine Castillo
informed against Antares,

13:34.210 --> 13:35.710
just like Laurel told us.

13:35.710 --> 13:38.000
I just didn't tell you about
that e-mail because...

13:40.210 --> 13:42.000
Well, I was afraid of this.

13:43.710 --> 13:45.880
Emmett, please.

13:47.250 --> 13:49.670
I'm not that stupid.

13:50.620 --> 13:51.880
I know.

13:53.330 --> 13:54.620
That's why I called you in.

13:56.040 --> 13:57.420
You want my job, right?

13:57.420 --> 13:58.830
I'm sorry?

13:58.830 --> 14:03.960
I've decided to pursue a job
opportunity outside of the firm.

14:03.960 --> 14:05.670
Why?
It's just time.

14:05.670 --> 14:07.670
You, on the other hand,
deserve a promotion --

14:07.670 --> 14:09.830
to managing partner
if it's up to me.

14:09.830 --> 14:11.170
You're kidding.

14:11.170 --> 14:12.580
Ah, you
single-handedly, uh,

14:12.580 --> 14:14.880
saved Ruthie's Burgers,
you brought in new accounts,

14:14.880 --> 14:16.790
not to mention
you're brilliant.

14:16.790 --> 14:18.040
Um...

14:18.040 --> 14:19.710
Unless
you're not interested.

14:19.710 --> 14:22.210
I'm interested.
Good.

14:22.210 --> 14:25.580
I'll make sure that e-mail
never sees the light of day,

14:25.580 --> 14:26.880
and I'll talk to the board.

14:27.960 --> 14:29.120
Thanks.

14:37.790 --> 14:39.210
That other job.

14:40.250 --> 14:42.210
It's a competing firm?

14:42.210 --> 14:43.540
No.

14:43.540 --> 14:45.000
Oh.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.880
Then what is it?

14:46.880 --> 14:48.000
Between us?

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
Always.

14:53.040 --> 14:55.040
Girl,
he's gonna run for D.A.

14:55.040 --> 14:56.500
Since when?

14:56.500 --> 14:59.620
I don't know, but it's
suspicious, right?

14:59.620 --> 15:01.960
Like maybe he knows you know
and that the Governor knows

15:01.960 --> 15:03.500
and this is just his way

15:03.500 --> 15:05.790
to protect himself
from going to jail.

15:05.790 --> 15:07.580
That's insane.

15:07.580 --> 15:09.880
This whole situation
is insane, Annalise.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.500
No wonder you drink.

15:26.880 --> 15:29.580
Your mom making sure her little
boy isn't working too hard?

15:30.750 --> 15:32.000
Not my mother.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.460
Janelle.

15:33.460 --> 15:34.540
You'd like her.

15:34.540 --> 15:36.330
Okay, how do you
have time to date

15:36.330 --> 15:38.040
with everything
that's going on?

15:38.040 --> 15:40.250
I compartmentalize --

15:40.250 --> 15:43.620
you know, find good things to
think about instead of the bad.

18:17.330 --> 18:18.920
We just got a court time
for this afternoon!

18:31.620 --> 18:34.000
Judge Singh:
Are the two of you 100% sure

18:34.000 --> 18:35.580
you want to proceed
without counsel?

18:35.580 --> 18:37.000
I'm a third-year law student

18:37.000 --> 18:38.420
and fully prepared to argue
the motion, Your Honor.

18:38.420 --> 18:40.540
Mr. Walsh, the seized
property at issue here

18:40.540 --> 18:42.420
doesn't appear
to belong to you.

18:42.420 --> 18:45.290
That's correct,
but as Mr. Hampton's husband,

18:45.290 --> 18:47.620
I also have personal information
on the computer,

18:47.620 --> 18:49.830
which qualifies me
as an aggrieved party

18:49.830 --> 18:52.170
pursuant to the Supreme Court's
determination of standing

18:52.170 --> 18:54.250
established in Wiebe v. NSA.

18:54.250 --> 18:56.500
Meaning
I have property rights

18:56.500 --> 18:57.920
that could be negatively
impacted

18:57.920 --> 18:59.330
by the government's actions.

18:59.330 --> 19:01.000
I know what
your property rights are.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.170
What I don't know is how
they're being violated here.

19:03.170 --> 19:04.500
Bordal:
They aren't, Your Honor.

19:04.500 --> 19:06.620
The FBI hasn't looked at
any materials on the computer

19:06.620 --> 19:08.210
beyond what's outlined
on the warrant.

19:08.210 --> 19:10.830
A warrant requested
by the same FBI agent

19:10.830 --> 19:12.710
who was recently called out
for misconduct

19:12.710 --> 19:14.080
in the case
of Gabriel Maddox.

19:14.080 --> 19:16.250
Agent Telesco's been removed
from this investigation.

19:16.250 --> 19:17.500
Well, then, doesn't
that invalidate

19:17.500 --> 19:18.920
your claim, Mr. Walsh?

19:18.920 --> 19:21.040
No. The basis for the warrant
was unfounded.

19:21.040 --> 19:22.460
But aren't there
legitimate reasons

19:22.460 --> 19:24.500
for the FBI's search
of the computer?

19:24.500 --> 19:26.620
-No. Any reason --
-I was asking the A.U.S.A.

19:26.620 --> 19:29.540
The wedding is the last place
Ronald Miller was seen alive.

19:29.540 --> 19:31.670
Their wedding photos could
contain vital information.

19:31.670 --> 19:32.830
Say the download thing.

19:32.830 --> 19:35.830
The FBI could have simply
downloaded the photos

19:35.830 --> 19:37.750
in our presence without
taking the computer.

19:37.750 --> 19:40.710
Not unless you and Mr. Hampton
already deleted some of them.

19:40.710 --> 19:42.620
Wedding photographer.
Young man.

19:42.620 --> 19:45.380
No more of that.
Sorry.

19:45.380 --> 19:48.670
My point is,
there is no legitimate reason

19:48.670 --> 19:51.210
why they needed access
to the entire computer.

19:51.210 --> 19:52.540
Judge Singh:
Well, I disagree, Counsel.

19:52.540 --> 19:54.000
While you are
quite confident,

19:54.000 --> 19:55.210
that doesn't make up
for the fact that

19:55.210 --> 19:57.080
the alleged bias
by Agent Telesco

19:57.080 --> 19:58.620
has been remedied.
Uh, but --

19:58.620 --> 20:01.710
I rule that the FBI can keep the
computer as long as they need.

20:01.710 --> 20:02.790
Motion denied.

20:04.880 --> 20:07.040
Too bad this wasn't
just a fender bender.

20:13.290 --> 20:15.460
Tell me all that money
was worth it.

20:15.460 --> 20:16.500
Check your e-mail.

20:20.540 --> 20:22.330
I thought we were
getting footage.

20:22.330 --> 20:23.580
He couldn't access
the full archives,

20:23.580 --> 20:24.830
just some compressed files.

20:25.880 --> 20:27.540
You think it's Emmett?

20:27.540 --> 20:29.000
Looks like him.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.040
I've wanted to smack the back
of that head enough times.

20:33.250 --> 20:34.420
It's not
the right contract.

20:34.420 --> 20:36.830
Get me the right one.
Otherwise, you're fired.

20:36.830 --> 20:38.420
If you're working on something,
I can come back.

20:38.420 --> 20:39.880
You're the boss.

20:39.880 --> 20:41.330
I'm here to do
whatever you need.

20:43.750 --> 20:46.420
Look, you're right.

20:46.420 --> 20:47.250
About?

20:49.290 --> 20:52.210
About me being
the firm's bitch.

20:52.210 --> 20:53.960
There's no reason
I should give up

20:53.960 --> 20:55.830
on the chance of you
outside of this place.

20:55.830 --> 20:59.830
So would you perhaps go to
dinner with me some time?

21:02.620 --> 21:04.290
Is tonight too soon?

21:15.000 --> 21:16.330
Frank:
So, I talked to Otis.

21:16.330 --> 21:17.330
He thinks this is the number
of the person

21:17.330 --> 21:19.170
who's been pranking you.

21:19.170 --> 21:20.620
It's a New York number,

21:20.620 --> 21:22.250
but Otis said
it's probably just a decoy

21:22.250 --> 21:23.920
so no one can trace
the location.

21:25.460 --> 21:27.120
You really want to open
this can of worms?

21:28.460 --> 21:30.670
It's fine.

21:35.080 --> 21:36.000
Woman's voice:
Nous sommes désolés.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.620
Le numéro que vous avez composé

21:37.620 --> 21:38.830
a été déconnecté.

21:38.830 --> 21:41.170
Ceci est un enregistrement.

21:41.170 --> 21:42.120
The hell does that mean?

21:42.120 --> 21:44.040
The number is disconnected.

21:47.210 --> 21:49.380
Maybe I should just
call my brother.

21:49.380 --> 21:52.210
Stop --
I need him to tell me
what's going on.

21:52.210 --> 21:54.380
Or maybe this is one of those
times where we do nothing.

21:54.380 --> 21:56.170
Look.

21:56.170 --> 21:57.960
We're never gonna be together --
I know that,

21:57.960 --> 22:00.420
but Christopher's my guy.

22:00.420 --> 22:02.750
I'll kill a whole army
of your family

22:02.750 --> 22:04.830
before I let them take him
from you again.

22:06.330 --> 22:08.960
I just want a normal life.

22:08.960 --> 22:11.120
Don't we all?

22:14.210 --> 22:17.120
-That's his poop cry.
-Yeah.

22:29.710 --> 22:31.170
You have sexy lipstick on.

22:31.170 --> 22:32.460
It's for my date
with Emmett.

22:32.460 --> 22:34.080
What?!
He changed his mind.

22:34.080 --> 22:36.420
You can't go.
It was your idea!

22:36.420 --> 22:38.750
Emmett had Nate Senior
killed, Annalise.

22:38.750 --> 22:43.120
I called in a favor and got
a copy of his phone records.

22:43.120 --> 22:45.000
They match what the Governor
gave you.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.540
You trust your I.T. guy?

22:46.540 --> 22:47.920
I.T. woman, and yes.

22:47.920 --> 22:49.290
She's my ex,
and she's a genius.

22:49.290 --> 22:50.960
Then why's she your ex?

22:50.960 --> 22:53.040
My point is,
Emmett's guilty.

22:57.500 --> 22:59.330
I want
to look him in the eye.

22:59.330 --> 23:01.040
Make his guilty ass sweat.

23:05.040 --> 23:06.250
Emmett:
I'm so glad

23:06.250 --> 23:07.830
you guys put the rib eye
back on the menu.

23:07.830 --> 23:08.790
Woman:
You've been here before?

23:08.790 --> 23:10.250
I've been a fan of the chef

23:10.250 --> 23:11.580
since her first restaurant
in New York.

23:11.580 --> 23:13.210
So you've had the crispy
Brussels sprouts?

23:13.210 --> 23:14.250
I'm mean, they're my crack.

23:14.250 --> 23:15.710
You might as well put in
the order now.

23:15.710 --> 23:18.540
Done.
What about cocktails?

23:18.540 --> 23:21.380
Uh, no, thanks.
We're not drinking tonight.

23:21.380 --> 23:23.250
Oh, don't not drink
because of me.

23:23.250 --> 23:25.250
Nah, it's fine.

23:25.250 --> 23:27.380
He'll have a double Scotch.
Keep 'em coming.

23:29.460 --> 23:30.790
Yeah.

23:30.790 --> 23:33.040
I hope that's not because
I seem nervous.

23:33.040 --> 23:34.330
Aren't you?

23:34.330 --> 23:36.290
A little.

23:36.290 --> 23:38.290
Is it me?
Am I making you nervous?

23:38.290 --> 23:40.080
Uh, I don't know how
to answer that.

23:40.080 --> 23:41.290
Well, how 'bout the truth?

23:43.460 --> 23:44.960
Uh, I don't know about you,

23:44.960 --> 23:46.830
but I haven't done this
in a while -- a date.

23:46.830 --> 23:47.620
And not with an employee.

23:47.620 --> 23:49.250
A colleague.

23:49.250 --> 23:51.500
You see, I'm --
I'm already screwing this up.

23:51.500 --> 23:53.500
Ah, that remains to be seen.

23:55.920 --> 23:58.040
Dinner is served.
Unless you're vegan.

23:58.040 --> 24:00.540
In that case,
there's no fake cheese here.

24:00.540 --> 24:02.000
Let me guess.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.210
You made Janelle
grilled cheese, too?

24:04.210 --> 24:06.620
Okay, first of all,
calling this "grilled cheese"

24:06.620 --> 24:08.960
is like saying LeBron James
is just a basketball player.

24:08.960 --> 24:12.170
No, no, this --
this is Crucolo on brioche.

24:16.380 --> 24:17.580
Damn.

24:17.580 --> 24:19.210
Yeah, I know my way
around a kitchen.

24:19.210 --> 24:22.170
Seriously, if you were to
make this for my whole house,

24:22.170 --> 24:24.540
they might actually
want you to stick around.

24:24.540 --> 24:26.210
You really want to know why
I want to stay here?

24:27.500 --> 24:30.170
You're in love with me.
I get it.

24:30.170 --> 24:31.420
I don't buy
that Wes killed Sam.

24:32.880 --> 24:34.620
And maybe you're okay
with not knowing anything

24:34.620 --> 24:36.170
about your birth parents,
but...

24:37.500 --> 24:40.210
I want to know
about my father.

24:40.210 --> 24:42.080
And that includes
finding out how he died.

24:44.880 --> 24:46.000
Okay.

24:50.620 --> 24:53.790
All I know
is what you know.

24:53.790 --> 24:56.670
No, you know more.
I can tell.

24:56.670 --> 24:59.330
Then you're just
making things up

24:59.330 --> 25:01.250
because you really
want to believe

25:01.250 --> 25:04.290
that half your DNA
isn't from a horrible man.

25:04.290 --> 25:07.170
I get that,
more than you know.

25:09.710 --> 25:10.580
What do you mean?

25:12.380 --> 25:14.460
My birth father
shot my mother.

25:16.620 --> 25:17.830
Do I know why?

25:18.880 --> 25:20.040
No.

25:22.670 --> 25:28.170
Because all I know is that
I am responsible for me --

25:28.170 --> 25:32.040
not my birth parents,
not my adoptive parents.

25:34.460 --> 25:36.500
And honestly,
I really like that.

25:38.380 --> 25:40.960
Because that means I don't
have to deal with their crap

25:40.960 --> 25:43.960
or expectations, and...

25:43.960 --> 25:45.000
And I get to be me.

25:47.380 --> 25:49.420
And on most days,
I really like me.

25:51.670 --> 25:53.920
None of my parents have
anything to do with that.

25:56.040 --> 25:58.210
Now I see why
Annalise sent you.

25:59.670 --> 26:01.210
What?

26:01.210 --> 26:02.580
You just made up
that story

26:02.580 --> 26:04.580
so we could stop
talking about Sam.

26:12.540 --> 26:13.790
Know what?

26:13.790 --> 26:16.080
Call your mother,
tell her everything --

26:16.080 --> 26:17.500
including
that Michaela Pratt

26:17.500 --> 26:19.790
will never ever
be with her lame son!

26:23.170 --> 26:24.580
Okay, okay, okay.

26:24.580 --> 26:25.540
Just let me go!

26:25.540 --> 26:26.790
I'm sorry.

26:26.790 --> 26:28.120
I believe you, all right?

26:28.120 --> 26:29.830
I hate myself for even
telling you any of that.

26:29.830 --> 26:31.620
Everything okay?

26:39.710 --> 26:41.750
What's going on?

26:41.750 --> 26:42.880
I'm just tired.

26:46.170 --> 26:47.750
What the hell'd you
say to her?

26:47.750 --> 26:49.120
Nothing.

26:50.460 --> 26:51.920
Hey.

26:51.920 --> 26:53.080
Walk away from me
and I'll...

26:55.040 --> 26:57.040
...beat your face.

26:57.040 --> 26:59.620
My family's fourth-generation
Concord --

26:59.620 --> 27:02.880
uh, ice-skating on Walden Pond,
lacrosse in the spring.

27:02.880 --> 27:04.750
I was there until Hotchkiss,
then Yale,

27:04.750 --> 27:07.000
Oxford for a semester --
This is the whitest crap
I have ever heard.

27:08.210 --> 27:09.380
So true.

27:09.380 --> 27:11.670
That was all set
before I was born --

27:11.670 --> 27:15.380
yeah, the poli sci major,
law school,

27:15.380 --> 27:18.040
partner track
at the white shoe law firm...

27:18.040 --> 27:19.380
I mean, it's pathetic
I'm only now

27:19.380 --> 27:20.920
thinking about getting off
the train.

27:20.920 --> 27:22.830
What do you mean?
New job?

27:22.830 --> 27:25.250
I'm not sure.

27:25.250 --> 27:27.670
And you? I-I mean, I know
you're not long for C&G.

27:27.670 --> 27:30.880
Mm, I think you're confusing me
with yourself.

27:30.880 --> 27:32.420
Sorry?

27:32.420 --> 27:34.210
You're running
for District Attorney.

27:37.830 --> 27:40.790
Yeah, I was, um...

27:40.790 --> 27:43.830
waiting until dessert
to tell you.

27:43.830 --> 27:45.290
Why?

27:45.290 --> 27:47.000
Isn't it obvious?
You don't approve.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.420
Who cares if I approve?

27:48.420 --> 27:49.250
I do.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.670
How long have you
been planning this?

27:53.670 --> 27:55.960
Not long.

27:55.960 --> 27:57.290
You inspired me,
actually.

27:57.290 --> 27:58.290
Me?

27:58.290 --> 28:00.290
I'm the firm's
good little boy, right?

28:02.080 --> 28:04.330
And not all of us can, uh,

28:04.330 --> 28:05.920
take a class action
to the Supreme Court.

28:05.920 --> 28:08.040
Maybe this is my version.

28:10.170 --> 28:11.500
You don't think
I should do it?

28:14.170 --> 28:16.420
I don't know
if I believe you.

28:16.420 --> 28:19.210
You don't believe my reasons
for wanting to do this

28:19.210 --> 28:20.330
or you just
don't like it?

28:20.330 --> 28:21.500
Both.

28:21.500 --> 28:23.120
See, I knew this would
ruin our dinner.

28:23.120 --> 28:24.670
No. Who says it's ruined?

28:24.670 --> 28:26.000
Well, you should see the way
you're looking at me.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.880
Well, I'm just trying to
get to know the real you.

28:27.880 --> 28:29.120
Well, I'm here.
Ask me anything.

28:29.120 --> 28:30.960
Well, that's not easy
for someone like you.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.330
What am I like, Annalise?

28:32.330 --> 28:35.460
You perform,
people-please.

28:35.460 --> 28:37.960
Why?
You covering up something?

28:37.960 --> 28:40.580
I have no idea what
the hell you're talking about.

28:40.580 --> 28:41.750
You don't get a big job

28:41.750 --> 28:43.210
at the most powerful law firm
in the world

28:43.210 --> 28:44.920
without burying
a few bodies.

28:44.920 --> 28:46.290
Is that what you're afraid of?
My past?

28:46.290 --> 28:47.500
I'm not afraid of
anything with you.

28:47.500 --> 28:48.830
You are. That's why
you're attacking me now.

28:48.830 --> 28:50.080
No.
This is me attacking you?

28:50.080 --> 28:51.620
Look, I got flaws, Annalise,
God knows --

28:51.620 --> 28:53.580
I'm noticing.
And you don't, right?
You're perfect.

28:53.580 --> 28:55.250
Smartest person in the room.

28:55.250 --> 28:56.830
I'm realer than anyone else
in the room.

28:56.830 --> 28:58.420
No, if that were true, you would
appreciate being with a man

28:58.420 --> 28:59.750
who calls you out
on your crap.

28:59.750 --> 29:01.040
But you can't handle that.

29:01.040 --> 29:03.120
You'd rather go in attack mode,
make me the enemy,

29:03.120 --> 29:05.830
even if it means pushing away
someone who cares about you.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.790
I just don't get you,
Annalise.

29:12.120 --> 29:13.250
Really?

29:14.540 --> 29:16.330
'Cause I get you completely.

29:36.420 --> 29:37.790
Bonnie: Where's Annalise?

29:37.790 --> 29:39.420
She was never coming.

29:46.250 --> 29:47.710
Sit.

29:56.080 --> 29:58.670
We're not sure the Governor
put the hit on my pops anymore.

30:00.210 --> 30:02.500
Then who did?

30:02.500 --> 30:03.710
Emmett Crawford.

30:06.750 --> 30:09.500
So Ron wasn't involved?

30:09.500 --> 30:12.420
We don't know who was involved
at this point.

30:15.920 --> 30:17.040
Why are you telling me this?

30:17.040 --> 30:18.580
Annalise clearly
didn't want you to.

30:18.580 --> 30:20.000
'Cause I need your help.

30:28.120 --> 30:31.380
We need the video
from this meeting.

30:31.380 --> 30:34.960
Warden Sykes is the only one
who can sign off.

30:34.960 --> 30:36.170
I don't know him.

30:36.170 --> 30:37.790
But you got something
on him.

30:43.710 --> 30:47.420
Police, medical examiner,
and inquest jury

30:47.420 --> 30:49.710
all came to the same
conclusion --

30:49.710 --> 30:52.120
my guards followed
all protocol that night.

30:52.120 --> 30:53.790
You can tell Lahey
I said that.

30:53.790 --> 30:55.290
I'm not here for him.

30:55.290 --> 30:58.000
Right. Think I haven't heard
he's still sniffing around this?

30:58.000 --> 31:00.290
There's people sniffing
around you, too.

31:00.290 --> 31:02.920
I'll get fired for telling
you this, disbarred,

31:02.920 --> 31:05.460
but the D.A.'s office is looking
into you for corruption.

31:05.460 --> 31:08.170
That's bull.

31:09.290 --> 31:10.540
This is Sykes.

31:10.540 --> 31:12.460
Jeff, hey. Ron Miller here.

31:12.460 --> 31:14.080
Oh. I didn't recognize
the number.

31:14.080 --> 31:15.880
Yeah, my phone died.

31:15.880 --> 31:17.830
Uh, listen, I'm calling
to thank you

31:17.830 --> 31:19.960
for handling the
Nate Lahey Senior transfer.

31:21.580 --> 31:22.880
I'm willing to tell you about
what's coming down the line.

31:22.880 --> 31:25.250
I just need you to agree.

31:25.250 --> 31:26.880
To what?

31:26.880 --> 31:28.250
Give me all
the security-cam footage

31:28.250 --> 31:30.120
from your visitor's room
on this date.

31:38.880 --> 31:40.880
Connor: That judge had it
out for me from the start.

31:40.880 --> 31:43.380
Plus that argument she made
about the removal of Telesco

31:43.380 --> 31:44.620
invalidating
our claim was wrong.

31:44.620 --> 31:45.920
Can you give me
your password again?

31:45.920 --> 31:47.580
"Bananas47" didn't work.

31:47.580 --> 31:49.330
Did you add
the exclamation point?

31:49.330 --> 31:51.330
It's the court's jurisdiction
to determine fairness

31:51.330 --> 31:53.710
in using
a biased affidavit,

31:53.710 --> 31:55.670
but she wouldn't
let me say that

31:55.670 --> 31:59.420
because she was so hell-bent
on putting me in my place.

32:03.250 --> 32:04.540
What are you doing?

32:04.540 --> 32:06.210
Hacking the judge's
credit card.

32:06.210 --> 32:07.920
On my computer?

32:07.920 --> 32:09.580
Your plan didn't work,
so now we're gonna do mine.

32:09.580 --> 32:11.960
It's a federal crime
to hack a judge, Oliver.

32:11.960 --> 32:13.420
I was reading
your ethics textbook

32:13.420 --> 32:14.750
and came across this thing

32:14.750 --> 32:17.960
about the appearance
of impropriety with judges.

32:17.960 --> 32:19.710
Well, you can't reargue
the same motion twice.

32:19.710 --> 32:21.170
Unless there's new evidence.

32:21.170 --> 32:23.040
Which there isn't.

32:23.040 --> 32:25.750
Then what do you call this?

32:31.290 --> 32:33.670
Just admit
you're impressed.

32:33.670 --> 32:36.960
Your motion states you have
newly discovered evidence.

32:36.960 --> 32:38.380
Or, like your husband,
do you plan

32:38.380 --> 32:40.920
to waste my time here
today, Mr. Hampton?

32:40.920 --> 32:43.210
Uh, o-of course not,
Your Honor.

32:43.210 --> 32:44.420
Then proceed.

32:44.420 --> 32:46.120
-Quickly.

32:46.120 --> 32:48.080
As you know,
I'm not a law student,

32:48.080 --> 32:50.290
but last night,
after the hearing,

32:50.290 --> 32:54.170
I was reading about how even
the appearance of impropriety

32:54.170 --> 32:59.580
can be just as problematic
as actual impropriety.

32:59.580 --> 33:02.880
As previously stated,
Agent Telesco's off this case.

33:02.880 --> 33:04.290
I'm not talking
about Agent Telesco.

33:04.290 --> 33:06.960
I'm talking about you,
Your Honor.

33:06.960 --> 33:08.580
Excuse me?
Let me know when it's over.

33:08.580 --> 33:10.710
Respectfully,
when you signed the warrant,

33:10.710 --> 33:12.210
it was Christmas Day,

33:12.210 --> 33:14.790
during which you ate at
Delmonicos Wine Bar.

33:14.790 --> 33:15.960
How do you know that?

33:15.960 --> 33:18.040
My old neighbor's
a waiter there.

33:18.040 --> 33:19.120
I talked to him
last night.

33:19.120 --> 33:21.040
Signing a warrant outside
the courtroom

33:21.040 --> 33:24.210
is completely within
a judge's discretion.

33:24.210 --> 33:26.290
Respectfully,
how can we know

33:26.290 --> 33:28.580
that you didn't
have wine with your meal?

33:28.580 --> 33:30.330
I didn't.
But it's
a wine bar.

33:30.330 --> 33:32.790
Unless I'm misinterpreting
the law,

33:32.790 --> 33:34.040
even if you weren't
drinking at the time

33:34.040 --> 33:35.250
that you signed
the warrant --

33:35.250 --> 33:37.000
You're worried about
the public appearance?

33:37.000 --> 33:39.210
Respectfully, yes,

33:39.210 --> 33:40.920
because according
to my research,

33:40.920 --> 33:43.710
you should be worried about
the public appearance, too,

33:43.710 --> 33:45.420
just in case anyone
even thinks

33:45.420 --> 33:48.080
that you had signed this warrant
under the influence.

33:48.080 --> 33:50.880
Judge, were you or were you not
under the influence

33:50.880 --> 33:52.170
at the time you signed
the warrant?

33:52.170 --> 33:53.330
Clearly, the answer is no.

33:53.330 --> 33:55.210
Yes,
but you only have my word.

33:55.210 --> 33:57.710
You are a renowned judge
in this district.

33:57.710 --> 34:01.040
Because I hold myself to
high standards, Mr. Bordal.

34:01.040 --> 34:04.540
Mr. Hampton,
I don't often say this...

34:04.540 --> 34:05.880
but well done.

34:05.880 --> 34:08.250
Bordal: Your Honor, this is
a District Attorney's death

34:08.250 --> 34:10.710
we're investigating --
The only way
I can expect others

34:10.710 --> 34:12.540
to hold themselves accountable
in my courtroom

34:12.540 --> 34:14.540
is if I do it myself.

34:14.540 --> 34:17.830
So thank you for being my
teacher here today, Mr. Hampton,

34:17.830 --> 34:20.790
and for doing it
so respectfully.

34:20.790 --> 34:24.330
Due to the potential appearance
of judicial impropriety

34:24.330 --> 34:26.790
and the fact that the FBI
has had ample time to download

34:26.790 --> 34:28.620
the necessary files,

34:28.620 --> 34:30.580
I hereby vacate the warrant

34:30.580 --> 34:33.120
and order the immediate return
of Mr. Hampton's computer.

34:35.620 --> 34:37.210
Asher:
Oliver for the win!

34:37.210 --> 34:38.920
How did you get it back?

34:38.920 --> 34:41.750
Apparently, Oliver's charm
works on judges

34:41.750 --> 34:43.380
just as well
as it does on me.

34:43.380 --> 34:45.000
It's the dimples.
Don't get too excited.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.880
I have to make sure they didn't
get past my firewalls.

34:53.040 --> 34:56.380
Researching ways
to kill off Gabriel?

34:56.380 --> 34:57.670
What?

34:57.670 --> 35:00.750
Whatever that was last night
looked pretty intense.

35:00.750 --> 35:02.210
Oh.

35:02.210 --> 35:03.830
He's just an idiot.

35:03.830 --> 35:06.420
Or you had feelings for him
and you know you shouldn't?

35:06.420 --> 35:07.920
No.

35:07.920 --> 35:10.000
You sure? Our secret.

35:11.750 --> 35:14.790
He won't shut up about Sam
or my birth parents.

35:14.790 --> 35:17.080
Wait, uh, back to Sam?

35:17.080 --> 35:18.580
Of course he doesn't
believe Wes did it.

35:18.580 --> 35:19.750
Why would he?

35:19.750 --> 35:22.540
And if that
weren't bad enough,

35:22.540 --> 35:25.040
he got in my head about
finding my birth parents.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.210
Okay, but, uh...

35:29.210 --> 35:31.580
I thought you always said
you'd never want to find them?

35:31.580 --> 35:33.000
I didn't.

35:34.750 --> 35:37.830
But Gabriel keeps making
me feel like, if I don't,

35:37.830 --> 35:41.080
then I'm never gonna
feel whole or something.

35:41.080 --> 35:43.540
And now here I am,
filling out this stupid form

35:43.540 --> 35:45.460
and hating myself for it.

35:45.460 --> 35:47.500
Okay.

35:47.500 --> 35:48.960
Uh, so...

35:48.960 --> 35:50.960
You're already whole.

35:50.960 --> 35:55.250
You're like the wholest woman
I've ever met.

35:55.250 --> 35:58.380
Then why do
I feel like I need to do this?

35:58.380 --> 36:02.040
For the...same reason
I called my mom.

36:03.250 --> 36:05.000
You called your mom?

36:05.000 --> 36:07.080
Yeah. On Christmas,

36:07.080 --> 36:09.710
after Pam was all,
"Where are your parents?"

36:12.540 --> 36:14.460
Still no call back,
by the way, which hurts,

36:14.460 --> 36:16.920
but, uh...
that's not my point.

36:16.920 --> 36:18.670
What is?

36:18.670 --> 36:20.670
Our lives suck.

36:22.420 --> 36:26.380
Like, everything's always
falling apart around us.

36:26.380 --> 36:29.580
So, yeah...

36:29.580 --> 36:32.210
...we want our mommy
or our daddy

36:32.210 --> 36:34.120
to tell us everything's
gonna be okay.

36:35.330 --> 36:38.120
I mean, it's actually pretty
damn understandable.

36:41.170 --> 36:42.290
I miss us.

36:44.290 --> 36:46.080
I know.

36:51.380 --> 36:53.170
Connor:
Michaela, Asher, get in here!

36:54.750 --> 36:56.460
What's going on?

36:56.460 --> 36:58.790
My laptop has a program
that takes a picture

36:58.790 --> 37:00.830
of anyone who tries to access
my encrypted files.

37:00.830 --> 37:01.880
Look.

37:04.290 --> 37:05.710
Of course Telesco
was gonna try and snoop.

37:05.710 --> 37:07.040
Look at the background.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.580
Oh, my God.

37:13.580 --> 37:15.960
They know about Sam,
Rebecca...

37:15.960 --> 37:17.330
Sinclair.

37:17.330 --> 37:18.620
They know everything.

37:22.880 --> 37:24.080
Are you still there?

37:24.080 --> 37:26.040
Yes. It's okay.

37:26.040 --> 37:27.920
Of course it's not okay.

37:27.920 --> 37:30.790
Listen, we'd be in jail right
now if they had any real proof.

37:30.790 --> 37:32.250
Shouldn't we not be talking
about this on the phone?

37:32.250 --> 37:33.500
Or getting out
of the country?

37:33.500 --> 37:34.580
Toronto's under
eight hours.

37:34.580 --> 37:35.830
Laurel:
Canada's not far enough.

37:35.830 --> 37:36.880
You need money
to be a fugitive.

37:36.880 --> 37:38.290
Asher: AK has money.

37:38.290 --> 37:40.040
And the $64,000
clinic prize,

37:40.040 --> 37:41.170
she can give to one of you.

37:42.290 --> 37:43.250
Who is that?

37:43.250 --> 37:44.830
Don't do anything
till I call back.

37:50.710 --> 37:52.380
What are you doing?

37:52.380 --> 37:53.960
You want me to be real?
Then you be real with me.

37:53.960 --> 37:55.670
We're done. There's no need
to drag this out.

37:55.670 --> 37:57.210
I didn't kill that man,
Annalise!

38:04.750 --> 38:08.040
You know what?
I want you out of my home.
No, not until
you accuse me to my face.

38:08.040 --> 38:09.420
Whoever told you that
is trying to get between us.

38:09.420 --> 38:11.500
You and Tegan told me!

38:11.500 --> 38:14.540
C&G has had a bug
in Tegan's office since Antares.

38:14.540 --> 38:16.210
I went and listened to it
after our dinner.

38:16.210 --> 38:17.960
Tegan: Emmett had Nate Senior
killed, Annalise.

38:17.960 --> 38:19.330
I got a copy
of his phone records.

38:19.330 --> 38:20.750
Emmett's guilty.

38:20.750 --> 38:23.920
You're too smart to believe
anything the Governor told you.

38:23.920 --> 38:25.170
Connor: Of course
she's not calling us back.

38:25.170 --> 38:27.170
Yeah, because
she's on a plane to Dubai.

38:27.170 --> 38:28.830
Look, I got about a grand
in my checking account.

38:28.830 --> 38:30.710
Maybe if we pool all our money
together, we can go, too.

38:30.710 --> 38:33.830
Or we just go to the FBI,
all negotiate immunity.

38:40.710 --> 38:42.210
What is this?

38:42.210 --> 38:43.620
I'm here as a friend.

38:43.620 --> 38:46.120
Since when?

38:46.120 --> 38:48.540
I'll tell you
who killed your father.

38:48.540 --> 38:50.000
You just need to
return the favor.

38:50.830 --> 38:52.830
It's right there.

38:52.830 --> 38:55.380
The night Nate Senior was shot,
you called Paula Gladden.

38:55.380 --> 38:57.330
I don't know who that is.
The guard who lied

38:57.330 --> 38:59.040
about Nate Senior
reaching for her gun!

38:59.040 --> 39:01.290
I never made a call.
T-This is all fake.

39:01.290 --> 39:03.880
Says you.
Th-- Why in the hell would
I kill Nate's father?!

39:03.880 --> 39:05.210
I quit, humiliated you.

39:05.210 --> 39:07.080
But that's not motive
to murder a man!

39:07.080 --> 39:08.170
Then why did you
visit him in prison?

39:08.170 --> 39:09.620
Who?
Nate Senior.

39:09.620 --> 39:11.250
There's a photo of you
meeting with him.

39:11.250 --> 39:12.710
Or are you gonna lie
about that, too?

39:15.580 --> 39:17.460
We're gonna be here all night.

39:17.460 --> 39:19.290
I'm gonna lose my job for this
footage, so go somewhere else

39:19.290 --> 39:20.670
if you're gonna be
all negative.

39:20.670 --> 39:21.880
There he is.

39:24.330 --> 39:25.830
You're playing yourself,
Annalise.

39:25.830 --> 39:27.540
I was genuinely happy

39:27.540 --> 39:28.920
when I was getting ready
for our dinner last night.

39:28.920 --> 39:30.500
I felt alive,
because finally

39:30.500 --> 39:32.000
I was doing something
I wanted to do.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.500
I was going on a date with
a brilliant, beautiful woman

39:34.500 --> 39:36.080
that I felt lucky
to be seen with.

39:36.080 --> 39:37.330
But for you, the whole night
was just a game.

39:37.330 --> 39:38.540
No, it was a game to you,

39:38.540 --> 39:39.710
some last-ditch effort

39:39.710 --> 39:40.960
to make me feel
sorry for you.

39:40.960 --> 39:42.670
No, I feel sorry for you
because you can't even

39:42.670 --> 39:44.710
recognize a good man when
he's standing in front of you.

39:44.710 --> 39:46.000
And you think that's you?

39:46.000 --> 39:47.420
Your first instinct is to
believe the worst in people.

39:47.420 --> 39:48.670
You know nothing about me.

39:48.670 --> 39:50.620
Was it your husband?
Was it he who broke you?

39:53.540 --> 39:55.000
FBI?

39:55.880 --> 39:57.330
Here we go.

40:02.710 --> 40:04.000
Can I help you?

40:04.000 --> 40:05.540
Package
for Laurel Castillo.

40:07.920 --> 40:09.210
That's me.

40:14.080 --> 40:15.710
You want to talk
about broken?

40:15.710 --> 40:17.000
Why the hell were you
so scared of me

40:17.000 --> 40:18.040
the second that you met me?

40:18.040 --> 40:19.620
I could smell it off of you.

40:19.620 --> 40:20.960
It's why I never
respected you.

40:20.960 --> 40:22.330
Ah, you don't respect
anyone but yourself!

40:22.330 --> 40:23.830
You let fear control
your whole life --

40:23.830 --> 40:25.580
fear of losing status,
losing face.

40:25.580 --> 40:27.460
Oh, and you're
just so strong, right?

40:27.460 --> 40:29.420
At least I don't hide behind
the color of my skin.

40:29.420 --> 40:31.080
No, you're hiding
in your anger.
No, that's you

40:31.080 --> 40:32.380
hiding behind
your white-boy privilege.

40:32.380 --> 40:33.960
You'd rather
sit behind a desk

40:33.960 --> 40:36.380
than to actually make a choice
that would cost you something.

40:36.380 --> 40:38.210
Trust me, just knowing you
has cost me.
So of course
I'm gonna believe

40:38.210 --> 40:39.880
that you killed
Nate Senior!

40:39.880 --> 40:42.040
Anything to hold on
to every pathetic crumb

40:42.040 --> 40:43.420
you think
is your birthright!

40:43.420 --> 40:46.210
But you know what?
Game over!

40:46.210 --> 40:48.460
The world doesn't belong to you
and your good old boys anymore!

40:48.460 --> 40:49.750
It belongs to me!

40:51.790 --> 40:53.670
Turn around, jackass.

40:54.880 --> 40:56.080
Patience.

40:58.750 --> 41:00.380
Bonnie: There.

41:10.580 --> 41:12.000
Who is that?

41:12.000 --> 41:13.580
Never seen him before.

41:15.460 --> 41:17.670
I have.

41:17.670 --> 41:21.170
It's the same size box that
the baptism gown came in.

41:21.170 --> 41:23.080
Then it must be
from your mother.

41:23.080 --> 41:25.210
A Christmas present
for Christopher?

41:25.210 --> 41:26.880
Maybe money we can
all run away with?

41:26.880 --> 41:28.080
Everyone, stop talking.

41:46.500 --> 41:49.500
Laurel.

41:49.500 --> 41:50.920
Is that...

41:54.250 --> 41:55.750
My mother.

41:58.170 --> 42:00.210
What?

42:00.210 --> 42:02.170
