00:14.101 --> 00:15.667
<i>
What comes to mind</i>

00:15.798 --> 00:18.366
<i>when you hear
the words Iran-Contra? </i>

00:18.496 --> 00:20.846
<i>The hearing
will please come to order. </i>

00:20.977 --> 00:22.892
<i>You may remember
a charismatic marine. </i>

00:25.416 --> 00:28.724
As you all know by now,
my name is Oliver North,

00:28.854 --> 00:31.074
lieutenant colonel,
United States Marine Corps.

00:31.205 --> 00:34.121
<i>Or an outcry about missiles
being sold to Iran. </i>

00:34.991 --> 00:36.862
Is it possible

00:36.993 --> 00:38.647
that fired White House
official Oliver North

00:38.777 --> 00:41.258
could have diverted profits
from Iran arms sales

00:41.389 --> 00:42.912
<i>to the Contras on his own?</i>

00:43.043 --> 00:44.870
<i>Maybe you recall
the funding of a covert war </i>

00:45.001 --> 00:46.133
<i>in Central America.</i>

00:48.657 --> 00:50.311
<i>It's a messy story</i>

00:50.441 --> 00:53.401
<i>that spanned
multiple continents, </i>

00:53.531 --> 00:57.013
<i>and it all started
in an office like this one. </i>

00:57.144 --> 01:00.364
<i>It was this tapestry
of intrigue. </i>

01:00.495 --> 01:02.410
<i>Every day
there was a surprise. </i>

01:02.540 --> 01:06.718
It was so outlandish.

01:06.849 --> 01:10.418
The first I heard about it,
I really couldn't believe it.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.771
<i>Perhaps because
of its complexity, </i>

01:15.901 --> 01:18.861
<i>Iran-Contra, unlike
other presidential scandals, </i>

01:18.991 --> 01:22.604
<i>barely left a mark
on our collective memory. </i>

01:22.734 --> 01:24.171
Watergate
was really easy-peasy

01:24.301 --> 01:26.260
compared to this.

01:26.390 --> 01:27.783
You didn't have to go to Iran.

01:27.913 --> 01:28.914
You didn't have to go
to Central America.

01:29.045 --> 01:31.221
The Sultan of Brunei
wasn't involved.

01:33.528 --> 01:35.965
It was far more sophisticated,
complex,

01:36.096 --> 01:39.360
and frankly scarier--
far scarier than Watergate.

01:39.490 --> 01:41.405
Why was it conducted
with such secrecy,

01:41.536 --> 01:42.493
and why were we all
kept in the dark

01:42.624 --> 01:43.886
for such a long period
of time?

01:46.758 --> 01:49.413
This was not low stakes.

01:49.544 --> 01:52.503
This was high stakes
on the world stage.

01:52.634 --> 01:55.071
<i>I think,
if you break down </i>

01:55.202 --> 01:57.465
<i>the whole scandal
piece by piece, </i>

01:57.595 --> 02:00.337
<i>a single clarifying theme
comes into focus. </i>

02:00.468 --> 02:03.123
We did not--repeat--did not

02:03.253 --> 02:07.039
trade weapons or anything else
for hostages.

02:07.170 --> 02:11.609
<i>Iran-Contra
is a story about hostages-- </i>

02:11.740 --> 02:14.351
<i>those who take them,
those who rescue them, </i>

02:14.482 --> 02:17.441
<i>and those who become
hostages themselves. </i>

02:17.572 --> 02:21.967
Any kind of hostage situation
creates a huge dilemma.

02:22.098 --> 02:25.536
It is a power game,
and the hostage taker

02:25.667 --> 02:27.495
largely controls
the situation,

02:27.625 --> 02:30.933
but it's also a challenge
you can't walk away from.

02:31.063 --> 02:33.501
You better make damn sure

02:33.631 --> 02:36.939
that you have looked
at every consequence,

02:37.069 --> 02:39.333
looked at
every possible nuance...

02:41.073 --> 02:43.598
Because once you give in
to a ransom,

02:43.728 --> 02:46.209
there is no stop.

02:48.864 --> 02:51.345
<i>I'm Leon Neyfakh.</i>

02:51.475 --> 02:54.913
<i>This is "Fiasco,"</i>

02:55.044 --> 02:57.307
<i>the story of Iran-Contra.</i>

03:05.359 --> 03:09.450
<i>While Iran-Contra is known
as Ronald Reagan's scandal, </i>

03:09.580 --> 03:10.842
<i>the stage was set
years earlier </i>

03:10.973 --> 03:12.279
<i>by a different president.</i>

03:17.153 --> 03:18.546
It's a long way
from Plains, Georgia,

03:18.676 --> 03:21.157
to Washington D.C.

03:21.288 --> 03:23.464
The strength of a person
can be measured

03:23.594 --> 03:26.467
by the path he takes
to travel there.

03:26.597 --> 03:28.382
For Jimmy Carter,
that road was one of hard work

03:28.512 --> 03:30.427
and determination.

03:30.558 --> 03:33.038
<i>This was the 1976
presidential campaign. </i>

03:36.564 --> 03:38.479
I heard he was
a peanut farmer.

03:40.524 --> 03:41.917
<i>Jimmy Carter
entered the race </i>

03:42.047 --> 03:43.875
<i>as a Washington outsider</i>

03:44.006 --> 03:45.921
<i>seeking an end
to the Nixonian era </i>

03:46.051 --> 03:48.010
<i>in American politics.</i>

03:48.140 --> 03:49.533
Hey, I'll go to your church
next Sunday, okay?

03:51.231 --> 03:53.058
<i>He was a man of faith.</i>

03:53.189 --> 03:54.843
<i>He wanted to advance
a human rights agenda </i>

03:54.973 --> 03:56.453
<i>across the world.</i>

03:56.584 --> 04:00.544
He is a genuine
moral beacon

04:00.675 --> 04:03.721
capable of making people
believe in something.

04:03.852 --> 04:05.375
He was the real thing.

04:07.638 --> 04:09.597
I just think
he's a very neat man.

04:09.727 --> 04:11.860
You got me, all right.

04:11.990 --> 04:14.123
I picture him
like one of us--

04:14.254 --> 04:15.429
one of the working people,
one of the common people.

04:22.566 --> 04:24.525
Jimmy Carter comes in

04:24.655 --> 04:28.920
promising to bring America
back to its best self.

04:29.051 --> 04:31.488
His number one campaign promise
in 1976

04:31.619 --> 04:33.447
was "I will not lie to you."

04:36.580 --> 04:37.973
We want Jimmy!

04:38.103 --> 04:40.454
We want Jimmy!
We want Jimmy!

04:40.584 --> 04:43.195
We want Jimmy!

04:43.326 --> 04:46.503
There's a new mood
in America.

04:46.634 --> 04:51.987
We've been shaken
by a tragic war abroad

04:52.117 --> 04:55.251
and by scandals
and broken promises at home.

04:55.382 --> 04:58.820
Our people are searching
for new voices

04:58.950 --> 05:01.475
and new ideas and new leaders.

05:03.433 --> 05:06.958
It was after our defeat
in the Vietnam War.

05:07.089 --> 05:09.613
It was after
the Watergate scandal.

05:09.744 --> 05:13.530
Jimmy Carter was elected
as a man who was supposed

05:13.661 --> 05:15.576
to be the antithesis
of all those things.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.710
It's now a time for healing.

05:19.841 --> 05:22.583
We wanna have faith again.

05:22.713 --> 05:24.672
We want to be proud again.

05:24.802 --> 05:27.022
We just want the truth again.

05:27.152 --> 05:28.676
It's time for the people
to run the government

05:28.806 --> 05:30.678
and not the other way around!

05:36.727 --> 05:39.687
He set out to change things,

05:39.817 --> 05:42.037
and he was a social engineer,

05:42.167 --> 05:44.431
and one of the things
that he wanted to do

05:44.561 --> 05:45.867
was create peace.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.097
<i>Election night</i>

05:59.228 --> 06:01.448
<i>from CBS News
Election Headquarters </i>

06:01.578 --> 06:02.927
<i>in New York.</i>

06:03.058 --> 06:05.408
Shortly before dawn,
Jimmy Carter reached

06:05.539 --> 06:09.020
the end of his improbable
two-year, half-million-mile

06:09.151 --> 06:11.545
political quest
and won the presidency.

06:16.158 --> 06:18.203
Remains to be seen
whether his politics

06:18.334 --> 06:21.685
of love and trust
and sweeping promises

06:21.816 --> 06:24.340
could capture a country
which has had reason

06:24.471 --> 06:26.516
to become mistrustful
of politicians.

06:35.351 --> 06:37.875
<i>Not long into
Carter's term, it became clear </i>

06:38.006 --> 06:39.964
<i>that he couldn't
just turn everything around </i>

06:40.095 --> 06:41.096
<i>like his campaign ads
had promised. </i>

06:43.794 --> 06:45.709
<i>The country
was being battered. </i>

06:45.840 --> 06:48.538
There is growing concern
about the general health

06:48.669 --> 06:51.628
of the American economy.

06:51.759 --> 06:53.717
<i>There were some
really big problems, </i>

06:53.848 --> 06:56.677
<i>and none of them
had simple solutions. </i>

06:56.807 --> 06:58.722
It's a profound change
that the American economy

06:58.853 --> 07:00.985
is undergoing,
a change with a name--

07:01.116 --> 07:02.596
deindustrialization.

07:05.120 --> 07:07.209
1979 in particular,

07:07.339 --> 07:08.689
average incomes
begin to decline,

07:08.819 --> 07:11.039
manufacturing jobs
in the United States

07:11.169 --> 07:13.998
begin to really
start tailing off,

07:14.129 --> 07:16.218
and people would say things
like, you know,

07:16.348 --> 07:17.915
"Well, my father certainly
didn't have to put up

07:18.046 --> 07:19.787
with this kind of crap."

07:19.917 --> 07:22.659
And, you know,
"My steel factory just closed,

07:22.790 --> 07:24.139
and now here I am
standing in line for gas."

07:27.447 --> 07:29.753
<i>The oil shortage of 1979</i>

07:29.884 --> 07:32.016
<i>forced Americans
to wake up before dawn </i>

07:32.147 --> 07:33.235
<i>just to fill up their tanks.</i>

07:36.151 --> 07:37.761
I'm all out.
Not a drop.

07:37.892 --> 07:39.502
How about five dollars?
That's it.

07:39.633 --> 07:41.243
Anger
and bewilderment are growing

07:41.373 --> 07:43.114
as more and more Americans
cope with gasoline lines

07:43.245 --> 07:45.160
and empty pumps.

07:45.290 --> 07:46.509
I have to be at work at00.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.252
For millions of Americans,

07:50.382 --> 07:51.993
this may be the worst weekend
they've ever faced

07:52.123 --> 07:54.169
for finding gasoline
to give them

07:54.299 --> 07:56.650
the automobile freedom
they take as their due.

07:56.780 --> 07:58.086
I'm in a line
two hours here,

07:58.216 --> 07:59.304
and I can't get gas.

07:59.435 --> 08:00.958
This is baloney.

08:03.874 --> 08:05.528
Carter doesn't get my vote
next year.

08:09.053 --> 08:12.317
<i>In July of 1979,
Carter did something </i>

08:12.448 --> 08:14.929
<i>politicians hardly ever do.</i>

08:15.059 --> 08:17.584
<i>He admitted to the voters
that good times </i>

08:17.714 --> 08:20.064
<i>were not around the corner,
and that the order of the day </i>

08:20.195 --> 08:21.979
<i>wasn't hope,
but self-sacrifice. </i>

08:24.416 --> 08:27.115
<i>It's clear
that the true problems </i>

08:27.245 --> 08:30.727
<i>of our nation are much deeper</i>

08:30.858 --> 08:33.164
than gasoline lines
or energy shortages,

08:33.295 --> 08:35.776
deeper even
than inflation or recession.

08:38.387 --> 08:41.216
<i>It is a crisis of confidence.</i>

08:43.131 --> 08:45.960
We can see this crisis
in the growing doubt

08:46.090 --> 08:48.484
about the meaning
of our own lives

08:48.615 --> 08:51.095
and in the loss
of a unity of purpose

08:51.226 --> 08:52.706
for our nation.

08:54.664 --> 08:57.928
The erosion of our confidence
in the future

08:58.059 --> 08:59.451
is threatening to destroy

08:59.582 --> 09:02.324
the social
and the political fabric

09:02.454 --> 09:04.718
of America.

09:04.848 --> 09:06.458
His advice
to the American people

09:06.589 --> 09:08.504
in his famous
"Crisis of Confidence" speech

09:08.635 --> 09:11.463
was that we have
to make do with less.

09:11.594 --> 09:14.249
We've lived too well,
and now we're paying the bill.

09:14.379 --> 09:19.210
<i>This is not a message
of happiness or reassurance, </i>

09:19.341 --> 09:21.735
<i>but it is the truth,</i>

09:21.865 --> 09:23.171
<i>and it is a warning.</i>

09:26.957 --> 09:30.221
I still think
he's a peanut farmer,

09:30.352 --> 09:31.701
and he don't know
how to run this country.

09:31.832 --> 09:32.746
Believe it.

09:34.530 --> 09:36.663
<i>Carter's hard truths
did not sit well </i>

09:36.793 --> 09:37.359
<i>with everyone.</i>

09:40.014 --> 09:40.797
Do you feel
that President Carter

09:40.928 --> 09:42.059
has been a good leader?

09:44.453 --> 09:46.324
No, I don't.

09:46.455 --> 09:47.891
I can't put my finger on it,

09:48.022 --> 09:49.414
but there's just something
he doesn't have.

09:52.026 --> 09:55.464
God has something
much better for everyone.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.858
<i>Some Americans
wanted a different answer. </i>

10:00.295 --> 10:01.775
<i>And if they switched
on their TV set </i>

10:01.905 --> 10:02.732
<i>on Sunday morning...</i>

10:02.863 --> 10:04.386
Ready.

10:04.516 --> 10:05.866
Baptist Church
in Lynchburg, Virginia.

10:05.996 --> 10:07.650
<i>...there was one
waiting for them </i>

10:07.781 --> 10:10.871
<i>in the form of a TV preacher
named Jerry Falwell. </i>

10:11.001 --> 10:12.873
Let's lead the way,
and under God,

10:13.003 --> 10:14.091
let's turn our country around.

10:14.222 --> 10:16.877
<i>The sense among Americans</i>

10:17.007 --> 10:19.053
<i>that things had gotten
fundamentally off track </i>

10:19.183 --> 10:21.316
went hand-in-hand
with the revival

10:21.446 --> 10:22.752
of religious feeling
in the United States.

10:24.406 --> 10:26.408
If America survives
this decade,

10:26.538 --> 10:27.452
it will be because
we experienced

10:27.583 --> 10:29.324
a spiritual awakening.

10:29.454 --> 10:31.239
My name is Ralph Reed,

10:31.369 --> 10:33.807
and I was a leader
of the Christian Coalition.

10:35.504 --> 10:38.376
I was a young person,
really lost spiritually.

10:38.507 --> 10:41.641
I opened up the Yellow Pages,
went to "Evangelical,"

10:41.771 --> 10:44.208
put my finger on a church,
and I walked in,

10:44.339 --> 10:46.123
and I sat in a pew,

10:46.254 --> 10:48.865
and the pastor turned around
to the organist,

10:48.996 --> 10:51.955
and he said,
"Stop the music."

10:52.086 --> 10:55.219
And he said,
"I don't know who you are.

10:55.350 --> 10:57.961
I don't know how you got here."

10:58.092 --> 11:01.225
He said, "But I want you
to know that today

11:01.356 --> 11:03.271
is your day of salvation."

11:07.231 --> 11:09.364
And Jerry Falwell,
I got to know him,

11:09.494 --> 11:12.628
and he is such
an important historic figure

11:12.759 --> 11:16.458
because he ushered
fundamentalists

11:16.588 --> 11:20.723
back into the mainstream
of American life,

11:20.854 --> 11:23.160
which is something that they
had been withdrawn from

11:23.291 --> 11:25.946
for many, many decades.

11:26.076 --> 11:28.383
<i>Falwell was part
of a new movement </i>

11:28.513 --> 11:30.602
<i>of televangelists
who offered Americans </i>

11:30.733 --> 11:33.649
<i>something precious,
a chance to be saved </i>

11:33.780 --> 11:35.912
<i>without ever leaving
their couch. </i>

11:38.828 --> 11:41.048
I want us to bow our heads
and close our eyes

11:41.178 --> 11:45.008
across this building,
there by television set.

11:45.139 --> 11:47.358
You know, Falwell had
"The Old Time Gospel Hour"

11:47.489 --> 11:49.926
and was seen
by millions of people.

11:54.061 --> 11:56.672
Those of you watching
by the television set,

11:56.803 --> 11:59.501
will you right now confess,
"Oh, God, I'm a sinner."

11:59.631 --> 12:01.590
And then write me and ask
for a free copy of my booklet,

12:01.721 --> 12:04.071
"How To Get Started Right."

12:04.201 --> 12:06.551
Literally, hundreds
of millions of dollars

12:06.682 --> 12:08.597
were being raised.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.991
Jerry Falwell built schools.

12:11.121 --> 12:13.297
He built a whole
social welfare system

12:13.428 --> 12:14.298
for his church members.

12:14.429 --> 12:16.605
You can say, "Bible."

12:16.736 --> 12:19.564
He had a TV empire.
He had a radio empire.

12:25.309 --> 12:27.224
It was this
all-encompassing culture

12:27.355 --> 12:29.444
in which one could kind of
live one's entire life

12:29.574 --> 12:30.140
in this kind of bubble.

12:32.055 --> 12:34.188
<i>By 1979,</i>

12:34.318 --> 12:38.670
<i>nearly a third of Americans
identified as evangelical. </i>

12:38.801 --> 12:41.456
Thank God that the parents
of these children

12:41.586 --> 12:45.460
didn't believe in abortion,
or they wouldn't be here.

12:45.590 --> 12:48.071
There was a view
in the late '70s

12:48.202 --> 12:50.378
that America
was in moral decline,

12:50.508 --> 12:54.164
and America, to us,
looked weak,

12:54.295 --> 12:57.211
and then I think a final thing
was profound disappointment

12:57.341 --> 12:59.517
with Jimmy Carter
and his presidency.

12:59.648 --> 13:01.389
One of the ironies
of this entire history

13:01.519 --> 13:03.217
was that Jimmy Carter

13:03.347 --> 13:04.784
was the first
presidential candidate

13:04.914 --> 13:08.396
who was a out and proud
evangelical Christian.

13:08.526 --> 13:10.572
But, again, he was, you know,
the old-fashioned kind

13:10.702 --> 13:13.923
of evangelical Christian
who kept his religious views

13:14.054 --> 13:14.968
out of his policy decisions.

13:15.098 --> 13:17.492
I see...

13:17.622 --> 13:19.407
the political situation

13:19.537 --> 13:22.149
and the military situation

13:22.279 --> 13:25.413
and the economic situation
and the energy problem.

13:25.543 --> 13:29.373
I see all of these
as crises that are pressing

13:29.504 --> 13:32.420
this planet towards a climax.

13:32.550 --> 13:35.075
<i>Falwell was tapping into
a sense that America </i>

13:35.205 --> 13:35.684
<i>was changing,
and that something </i>

13:35.815 --> 13:38.121
<i>had already been lost.</i>

13:38.252 --> 13:40.297
<i>He began to build
not just a religious movement, </i>

13:40.428 --> 13:42.038
<i>but a political one.</i>

13:42.169 --> 13:43.213
Right here in Washington,

13:43.344 --> 13:45.825
this city has become
as corrupt

13:45.955 --> 13:48.001
as any of the cities
in the Old Testament

13:48.131 --> 13:49.741
which God destroyed,

13:49.872 --> 13:53.702
and I think that unless we
have a fundamental change,

13:53.833 --> 13:55.312
I think this country
will be destroyed as well.

13:59.229 --> 14:01.057
<i>Jimmy Carter
wasn't just facing </i>

14:01.188 --> 14:02.319
<i>a changing landscape
on the home front. </i>

14:09.283 --> 14:12.547
<i>In 1979, it seemed
the whole world </i>

14:12.677 --> 14:15.071
<i>was going through
a transformative convulsion. </i>

14:15.202 --> 14:17.030
This is a day
when every nation is claiming

14:17.160 --> 14:18.205
its own identity.

14:20.120 --> 14:22.252
<i>That included Iran,</i>

14:22.383 --> 14:24.733
<i>America's most important ally
in the Middle East. </i>

14:34.830 --> 14:37.441
<i>In 1979, Iranians were looking</i>

14:37.572 --> 14:40.531
<i>to redefine
their national identity. </i>

14:40.662 --> 14:42.620
<i>For years, the country
had been caught </i>

14:42.751 --> 14:44.709
<i>in the middle
of an ideological battle </i>

14:44.840 --> 14:46.276
<i>between Soviet
and Western influence. </i>

15:00.682 --> 15:02.771
<i>After months of unrest...</i>

15:05.817 --> 15:08.733
<i>...Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi,
Iran's monarch, </i>

15:08.864 --> 15:10.344
<i>fled the country.</i>

15:13.913 --> 15:17.220
<i>America had been a friend
of the shah for years. </i>

15:17.351 --> 15:19.744
<i>Now that Iran was
no longer under his control, </i>

15:19.875 --> 15:22.312
<i>an uneasy
power vacuum prevailed, </i>

15:22.443 --> 15:26.751
<i>and Jimmy Carter found himself
in a delicate position. </i>

15:26.882 --> 15:29.015
The situation in Iran now,
politically speaking,

15:29.145 --> 15:32.409
is very sensitive.

15:32.540 --> 15:34.324
We do not have any intention
of interfering

15:34.455 --> 15:35.760
in the affairs of Iran,

15:35.891 --> 15:37.458
the internal affairs
of their government,

15:37.588 --> 15:39.112
and we don't want
any other country

15:39.242 --> 15:40.287
to do it either.

15:42.463 --> 15:45.945
<i>But as 1979 drew to a close,</i>

15:46.075 --> 15:48.425
<i>Carter unintentionally tripped
a live wire </i>

15:48.556 --> 15:50.601
<i>when he welcomed the shah
into the United States. </i>

15:50.732 --> 15:52.560
<i>Good evening.</i>

15:52.690 --> 15:54.170
<i>The American embassy in Tehran
is in the hands </i>

15:54.301 --> 15:56.520
<i>of Muslim students tonight.</i>

15:56.651 --> 15:58.174
<i>Spurred on
by an anti-American speech </i>

15:58.305 --> 15:59.828
<i>by the Ayatollah Khomeini,</i>

15:59.959 --> 16:01.525
<i>they stormed the embassy,</i>

16:01.656 --> 16:03.223
<i>fought the marine guards
for three hours, </i>

16:03.353 --> 16:05.181
<i>overpowered them,
and took dozens </i>

16:05.312 --> 16:06.226
<i>of American hostages.</i>

16:12.623 --> 16:14.234
I'm John Limbert.

16:14.364 --> 16:16.236
I was
a foreign service officer.

16:16.366 --> 16:18.325
I was held hostage
for 14 months

16:18.455 --> 16:21.589
between 1979 and 1981.

16:24.548 --> 16:26.246
It was--let's see.
It was November 4th.

16:26.376 --> 16:27.290
It was a Sunday,
which was the first day

16:27.421 --> 16:28.683
of our work week.

16:28.813 --> 16:33.296
It was chilly, drizzly.

16:33.427 --> 16:37.170
That morning, there was going
to be a big demonstration

16:37.300 --> 16:38.780
at Tehran University.

16:41.087 --> 16:44.438
And about- 00 or- 30
in the morning, as I remember,

16:44.568 --> 16:47.136
a group stopped
in front of the embassy,

16:47.267 --> 16:48.877
started shouting slogans.

16:53.577 --> 16:56.798
Death to America,
death to Carter.

16:56.928 --> 16:59.322
And I can remember
being in my office

16:59.453 --> 17:02.282
and hearing this shouting,
and it got--

17:02.412 --> 17:03.892
Instead of marching on,
it got louder.

17:21.649 --> 17:23.433
And then, all of a sudden,
these folks were--

17:23.564 --> 17:26.523
people were in the compound.

17:26.654 --> 17:28.743
My name is Alan Golacinski.

17:28.873 --> 17:31.485
I was the regional
security officer in Tehran.

17:33.791 --> 17:37.360
Based on previous experiences
and previous successes,

17:37.491 --> 17:38.579
I believed I could talk
these people out.

17:40.320 --> 17:43.453
I contacted the chargé

17:43.584 --> 17:46.717
and asked for permission
to go out

17:46.848 --> 17:50.504
and negotiate
with these people.

17:50.634 --> 17:54.508
They grabbed me,
tied my hands behind me,

17:54.638 --> 17:57.598
blindfold on me.

17:57.728 --> 18:00.122
We were pretty much
out of options at this point.

18:02.994 --> 18:03.821
There's a wonderful
Iranian word...

18:05.127 --> 18:07.869
Which means confusion.

18:07.999 --> 18:10.263
The students--I think
most of them

18:10.393 --> 18:12.917
were in their early 20s.

18:13.048 --> 18:15.050
I'm not sure
that they had thought about

18:15.181 --> 18:17.792
this whole project
beyond the first two steps.

18:17.922 --> 18:19.663
I mean, it was,
"We'll invade the embassy.

18:19.794 --> 18:21.448
Well, what do we do next?

18:21.578 --> 18:22.710
Well, we'll figure it out
when we get there."

18:31.458 --> 18:32.763
My name is Doyle McManus.

18:32.894 --> 18:34.635
I've spent 40 years
as a reporter

18:34.765 --> 18:36.289
covering
American foreign policy

18:36.419 --> 18:38.291
and American politics.

18:38.421 --> 18:39.901
I went into Tehran

18:40.031 --> 18:43.470
the day after
the embassy was seized.

18:47.822 --> 18:50.433
One of the big questions
we all wondered about

18:50.564 --> 18:52.261
was how scary
is this going to be

18:52.392 --> 18:53.480
for American journalists.

19:09.974 --> 19:11.802
And so
it was quite stunning,

19:11.933 --> 19:13.413
but also a relief

19:13.543 --> 19:16.372
to have the Iranians
waving flags

19:16.503 --> 19:18.069
that said, "Death to America,"

19:18.200 --> 19:20.420
put out their hands and say,
"Welcome to Iran,

19:20.550 --> 19:24.511
and want to have
an absolutely cheerful

19:24.641 --> 19:27.383
and generous conversation
with the individual American

19:27.514 --> 19:28.950
on the street in front of them.

19:32.519 --> 19:34.129
<i>The students
who had taken the embassy </i>

19:34.260 --> 19:36.566
<i>saw their newfound
media spotlight </i>

19:36.697 --> 19:39.395
<i>as an opportunity to appeal
to the American people. </i>

19:39.526 --> 19:41.745
The Iranian people
love American people

19:41.876 --> 19:44.618
and hate
the American government.

19:44.748 --> 19:47.838
We don't think
that American people

19:47.969 --> 19:51.494
were in support
of all the oppression

19:51.625 --> 19:55.890
that were going on in Iran
under the rule of the shah.

19:56.020 --> 19:59.154
<i>The hostage takers
really only had one demand. </i>

19:59.285 --> 20:01.678
<i>They wanted the shah
back in Iran </i>

20:01.809 --> 20:04.072
<i>to face the revolution
and stand trial. </i>

20:04.203 --> 20:05.813
Sources here say
that if the shah

20:05.943 --> 20:08.859
will return to Iran,
he would face certain death.

20:08.990 --> 20:11.427
<i>While many Iranians
saw the U.S. </i>

20:11.558 --> 20:13.473
<i>as harboring a criminal,</i>

20:13.603 --> 20:16.476
<i>the matter was more complicated
for Carter. </i>

20:16.606 --> 20:19.000
In October,
President Carter learns

20:19.130 --> 20:21.524
that the shah
is sick with cancer

20:21.655 --> 20:24.701
and is told
that he needs urgent treatment

20:24.832 --> 20:27.051
that he can get
only in the United States.

20:27.182 --> 20:30.881
President Carter,
he meets his advisors

20:31.012 --> 20:34.581
and basically says
what should he do,

20:34.711 --> 20:37.801
and he found his advisors
pretty much united

20:37.932 --> 20:43.111
in favor of admitting--
admitting the shah.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.505
At the end of this meeting,
President Carter

20:45.635 --> 20:48.464
turns to his advisors,
and he says,

20:48.595 --> 20:50.945
"All right, I'll do it,

20:51.075 --> 20:53.208
but tell me one thing.

20:53.339 --> 20:55.645
What are you gonna
advise me to do

20:55.776 --> 20:59.301
when our embassy is overrun
and our people taken hostage?"

21:02.086 --> 21:06.047
And history does not record
that there were any answers,

21:06.177 --> 21:07.396
so I expect there was
a lot of looking at shoes.

21:18.625 --> 21:19.930
<i>The students were convinced</i>

21:20.061 --> 21:21.497
<i>that the admission
of the shah </i>

21:21.628 --> 21:24.892
<i>was part of a CIA plot
to return him to power in Iran. </i>

21:28.983 --> 21:33.117
<i>They ransacked the embassy,</i>

21:33.248 --> 21:35.511
<i>searching for evidence
of what exactly America </i>

21:35.642 --> 21:37.426
<i>was doing in their country.</i>

21:54.661 --> 21:56.880
It seems
they really do believe

21:57.011 --> 21:59.187
that the shah's sickness
is just a cover

21:59.318 --> 22:01.276
and that he's in
the United States

22:01.407 --> 22:03.931
to plot a counterrevolution
with the Americans.

22:05.672 --> 22:07.543
Once we admit the shah,

22:07.674 --> 22:11.155
whatever explanation we give,

22:11.286 --> 22:16.509
the signal is going to be
1953 all over again.

22:23.603 --> 22:27.650
<i>"1953 all over again."</i>

22:27.781 --> 22:30.566
<i>To understand what that means,
we have to talk </i>

22:30.697 --> 22:33.308
<i>about Iran's
most precious resource. </i>

22:33.439 --> 22:35.397
<i>Developed
by British interests, </i>

22:35.528 --> 22:38.095
<i>Iranian oil has been
the subject of bitter dispute. </i>

22:38.226 --> 22:41.577
<i>In 1953, Iran was governed</i>

22:41.708 --> 22:43.318
<i>by Prime Minister
Mohammad Mosaddegh </i>

22:43.449 --> 22:45.320
<i>who was fighting
to reclaim control </i>

22:45.451 --> 22:48.236
<i>of Iran's oil
from the British. </i>

22:48.367 --> 22:52.022
<i>But just two years
after being voted into office, </i>

22:52.153 --> 22:54.938
<i>Mosaddegh was
forcibly removed from power. </i>

22:56.157 --> 22:57.941
<i>Former Premier
Mosaddegh's ruined house </i>

22:58.072 --> 22:59.987
<i>is a mute testimony
to three days </i>

23:00.117 --> 23:02.163
<i>of bloody rioting culminating
in a military coup. </i>

23:02.293 --> 23:04.644
<i>Mosaddegh
was finally apprehended </i>

23:04.774 --> 23:06.036
<i>and awaits trial for treason.</i>

23:09.170 --> 23:10.519
There is certainly
American meddling

23:10.650 --> 23:13.914
in 1953, there's no doubt.

23:14.044 --> 23:16.830
<i>What was made to look
like a popular uprising </i>

23:16.960 --> 23:19.615
<i>was actually a British plot
backed by the U.S. government </i>

23:19.746 --> 23:21.443
<i>to keep control of the oil.</i>

23:23.227 --> 23:25.795
The United States,
they joined the British effort

23:25.926 --> 23:27.188
to overthrow Mosaddegh.

23:29.320 --> 23:30.931
There is actually a meeting
at the State Department.

23:31.061 --> 23:32.628
We have the documents for it.

23:32.759 --> 23:34.891
"So how do we get rid
of this madman now?"

23:35.022 --> 23:37.285
So they begin to plan
to get rid of this madman.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.113
Is that meddling?
Of course it is.

23:39.243 --> 23:41.071
You had a million dollars
in cash

23:41.202 --> 23:43.857
- to run the coup, right?
- That's right.

23:43.987 --> 23:48.905
And we used about 60,000 of it.
That was all.

23:50.820 --> 23:53.170
<i>The $60,000 paid for the CIA</i>

23:53.301 --> 23:55.869
<i>to launch
a disinformation campaign </i>

23:55.999 --> 23:58.567
<i>aimed at ginning up support
for the eventual military coup </i>

23:58.698 --> 24:00.308
<i>against Mosaddegh.</i>

24:00.439 --> 24:04.921
Very competent agents
started a movement.

24:05.052 --> 24:08.795
They led a very large
and constantly growing mob

24:08.925 --> 24:12.407
up the avenue on which
the American embassy

24:12.538 --> 24:16.106
was at one end,
and Mosaddegh's house

24:16.237 --> 24:18.369
was towards
the middle of town.

24:18.500 --> 24:20.937
<i>With Mosaddegh
out of the way, </i>

24:21.068 --> 24:22.765
<i>the British got their oil,</i>

24:22.896 --> 24:24.941
<i>and the U.S.
got an ally in the shah. </i>

24:28.075 --> 24:30.251
It is a lot more complicated

24:30.381 --> 24:32.122
than simply saying
it was the meddling

24:32.253 --> 24:34.908
that overthrew Mosaddegh,

24:35.038 --> 24:38.694
but by '79,
it got some of these students

24:38.825 --> 24:41.828
thinking that they're
doing history's work

24:41.958 --> 24:44.439
fighting imperialism,

24:44.570 --> 24:47.268
responding to what
they thought was the injustice

24:47.398 --> 24:51.054
of the U.S. in 1953.

24:51.185 --> 24:53.143
My name is Mohsen Sazegara.

24:53.274 --> 24:57.539
I was a political activist
against shah.

24:57.670 --> 25:00.237
The word that we used
was "shah is a U.S. puppet."

25:00.368 --> 25:02.588
Do...music!

25:05.895 --> 25:08.071
<i>After the coup,
the shah launched </i>

25:08.202 --> 25:11.074
<i>a massive overhaul
of Iranian society. </i>

25:11.205 --> 25:13.294
<i>He called it
the White Revolution. </i>

25:14.774 --> 25:17.733
From music to Hollywood

25:17.864 --> 25:20.867
to jeans to Pepsi-Cola,

25:20.997 --> 25:25.001
the dominant cultural presence
was the U.S.

25:26.960 --> 25:29.179
Now my mother
and her two daughters

25:29.310 --> 25:31.138
went to university,
were educated,

25:31.268 --> 25:33.749
they could get
their own income.

25:33.880 --> 25:35.708
That was a very good step.

25:35.838 --> 25:38.449
<i>By the 1970s,</i>

25:38.580 --> 25:42.149
<i>Iran was one of the fastest
developing nations in the world. </i>

25:42.279 --> 25:43.803
The capital
has not just grown.

25:43.933 --> 25:46.283
It has exploded,
and in the process,

25:46.414 --> 25:48.677
members of the royal family
and leading businessmen

25:48.808 --> 25:50.549
have made massive profits.

25:53.290 --> 25:54.944
You have a shah
that was becoming

25:55.075 --> 25:58.034
increasingly self-righteous,
increasingly authoritarian.

26:00.123 --> 26:02.691
You can't import
all the productions

26:02.822 --> 26:04.954
of Western civilization,

26:05.085 --> 26:09.393
but don't import the software
of Western civilization

26:09.524 --> 26:12.222
like democracy,
like human rights.

26:12.353 --> 26:15.051
One of our laws is
that communism is not allowed.

26:16.923 --> 26:19.578
<i>Student groups espousing
left-wing ideology </i>

26:19.708 --> 26:22.450
<i>were targeted
by the shah's secret police, </i>

26:22.581 --> 26:25.279
<i>the SAVAK, which was formed
with the help of the CIA </i>

26:25.409 --> 26:27.934
<i>after the 1953 coup.</i>

26:28.064 --> 26:30.545
And if you went for
a demonstration, for instance,

26:30.676 --> 26:33.592
they attacked us
inside the university.

26:44.211 --> 26:46.909
<i>Stories of the regime's
brutality and torture </i>

26:47.040 --> 26:48.476
<i>of political prisoners
brought a chill </i>

26:48.607 --> 26:51.218
<i>over daily life in Iran.</i>

26:51.348 --> 26:55.265
If, for instance,
you distribute any pamphlets,

26:55.396 --> 26:57.180
the students knew

26:57.311 --> 27:00.662
that they shouldn't take it
from the ground

27:00.793 --> 27:03.926
because you could be sentenced
to six months jail,

27:04.057 --> 27:07.930
so they put their foot
on the pamphlet on the ground

27:08.061 --> 27:09.149
and read it
while it was on the ground.

27:21.030 --> 27:22.989
There was one force
that was allowed

27:23.119 --> 27:24.947
to organize, mobilize.

27:25.078 --> 27:26.645
That was the clergy.

27:26.775 --> 27:30.257
And the reason the shah
allowed the clergy

27:30.387 --> 27:34.304
is because he thought
the best way to fight communism

27:34.435 --> 27:35.958
is religion.

27:37.264 --> 27:39.919
This is an illusion
that Western powers held.

27:41.964 --> 27:45.054
We feel as responsible
for politic,

27:45.185 --> 27:49.015
for economy, and for morale.

27:50.799 --> 27:52.758
<i>The clergy gained a foothold
in the shadows </i>

27:52.888 --> 27:55.935
<i>of the high-rises that dotted
the new, urban landscape. </i>

27:56.065 --> 27:57.676
Outwardly,
progress and glitter.

27:57.806 --> 28:00.374
Beneath the surface,
thousands of people

28:00.504 --> 28:02.419
still live in mud huts
without running water

28:02.550 --> 28:04.987
or sanitation.

28:05.118 --> 28:08.338
You had peasants
who saw the affluence

28:08.469 --> 28:12.168
in the nouveau riche class,
and their resentment increased.

28:15.737 --> 28:20.568
They had profound
religious values.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.918
They were ill at ease
with the sight of a woman

28:23.049 --> 28:26.052
in a miniskirt, for example,

28:26.182 --> 28:29.142
and the clergy
were whispering in their ear

28:29.272 --> 28:31.927
that all of this is part
of a corrupting,

28:32.058 --> 28:34.930
Western, Israeli, Zionist,
Jewish conspiracy

28:35.061 --> 28:37.150
to break down Islam.

28:41.632 --> 28:44.635
<i>As this anti-Western
gospel spread, </i>

28:44.766 --> 28:47.682
<i>the student activists
decided to forge an alliance. </i>

28:47.813 --> 28:50.990
We thought
that a network of the clergy

28:51.120 --> 28:53.557
can be helpful
to the revolution.

28:53.688 --> 28:56.560
Led by the mullahs,
the Muslim priests,

28:56.691 --> 28:58.432
the crowds assembled
and then choked

28:58.562 --> 28:59.259
the center of the city.

29:06.092 --> 29:07.397
That was
one of our strategies

29:07.528 --> 29:10.052
to have a unity,

29:10.183 --> 29:14.056
a very powerful force
against shah.

29:22.151 --> 29:24.632
And you
as a church leader

29:24.763 --> 29:28.244
are ready to see them
start an armed struggle?

29:28.375 --> 29:31.334
The teaching of Quran says

29:31.465 --> 29:35.774
that when a peaceful struggle
is not useful,

29:35.904 --> 29:39.429
then you must begin
an armed struggle--jihad.

29:57.056 --> 29:58.622
Much of that coalition

29:58.753 --> 30:02.104
wanted a democratic,
secular nation,

30:02.235 --> 30:05.107
and it's remarkable
because the leader

30:05.238 --> 30:06.805
of that revolution
was someone who,

30:06.935 --> 30:09.590
if anybody had bothered
to read his writing,

30:09.720 --> 30:12.332
stood in opposition
to all of that.

30:20.470 --> 30:22.124
<i>Waiting in the serenity
of the French countryside </i>

30:22.255 --> 30:24.170
<i>was that leader,</i>

30:24.300 --> 30:27.347
<i>the exiled Islamic cleric
Ruhollah Khomeini. </i>

30:27.477 --> 30:31.655
There are some
isolated priests

30:31.786 --> 30:35.181
with whom I had...

30:35.311 --> 30:38.662
to take some strong measures.

30:40.795 --> 30:43.406
<i>Banished by the shah,
Ayatollah Khomeini </i>

30:43.537 --> 30:45.147
<i>relied on a network
of followers </i>

30:45.278 --> 30:47.062
<i>to distribute sermons
throughout Iran </i>

30:47.193 --> 30:47.889
<i>on cassette tape.</i>

30:56.202 --> 30:58.682
A close advisor
to Ayatollah Khomeini

30:58.813 --> 31:01.642
called me from Paris

31:01.772 --> 31:03.644
and told me that,
"Mohsen, we need you."

31:05.515 --> 31:06.516
That was00
in the afternoon.

31:06.647 --> 31:08.518
I borrowed $200,

31:08.649 --> 31:11.130
bought a ticket to Paris,

31:11.260 --> 31:13.393
and I was in the plane
00 at night.

31:17.876 --> 31:21.314
He had a type of mysticism,

31:21.444 --> 31:24.317
and contrary
to his public image,

31:24.447 --> 31:27.233
he was very kind.

31:27.363 --> 31:28.669
<i>Followers
of Ayatollah Khomeini </i>

31:28.799 --> 31:30.453
<i>gathered outside
the small house </i>

31:30.584 --> 31:31.672
<i>where he's been living
in France </i>

31:31.802 --> 31:33.065
<i>and cheered the news
that the shah </i>

31:33.195 --> 31:34.370
<i>had left Iran.</i>

31:36.764 --> 31:39.462
<i>When the shah fled
from Iran in January of 1979, </i>

31:39.593 --> 31:41.029
<i>Khomeini made his move.</i>

31:43.249 --> 31:45.338
<i>Flanked by Western reporters,</i>

31:45.468 --> 31:47.862
<i>he boarded a flight
home to Iran. </i>

31:47.993 --> 31:51.474
I was in charge
of media relationship.

31:51.605 --> 31:55.478
250 journalists wanted
to get on the aeroplane.

31:55.609 --> 31:58.394
We had to tell 100
of them that, "Sorry,

31:58.525 --> 32:00.135
we can't have you."

32:14.454 --> 32:16.282
<i>With the hesitant
steps of a man of 79, </i>

32:16.412 --> 32:19.285
<i>he walks onto Iranian soil
for the first time </i>

32:19.415 --> 32:20.590
<i>since the shah forced him
to leave the country </i>

32:20.721 --> 32:22.070
<i>16 years ago.</i>

32:30.861 --> 32:33.429
<i>Khomeini's arrival in
Tehran was everything and more </i>

32:33.560 --> 32:35.605
<i>than had been expected.</i>

32:35.736 --> 32:37.520
<i>His followers,
millions of them, </i>

32:37.651 --> 32:39.261
<i>fought and screamed
as they scrambled </i>

32:39.392 --> 32:40.741
<i>onto the motor van</i>

32:40.871 --> 32:43.178
<i>that carried him
through the city. </i>

32:52.666 --> 32:54.233
We believed--

32:54.363 --> 32:56.800
which I think
it was not wrong--

32:56.931 --> 33:00.674
that the absolute majority
of the country,

33:00.804 --> 33:02.719
they support
Ayatollah Khomeini

33:02.850 --> 33:04.634
and are with the revolution.

33:09.422 --> 33:11.380
It's extraordinary
how so many people can believe

33:11.511 --> 33:13.556
that this frail, old priest

33:13.687 --> 33:16.603
holds all the answers
to Iran's problems.

33:18.909 --> 33:21.782
<i>
Khomeini was back in Iran,</i>

33:21.912 --> 33:24.263
<i>and his first speech
made his intentions clear. </i>

33:35.622 --> 33:37.319
<i>Nine months later,</i>

33:37.450 --> 33:38.886
<i>when the students
took the embassy, </i>

33:39.017 --> 33:41.149
<i>Khomeini's power grab
was all but complete. </i>

33:42.977 --> 33:45.327
That hostage taking,

33:45.458 --> 33:48.548
you can think
about that as a turn point.

33:48.678 --> 33:53.292
It ended
to a totalitarian regime

33:53.422 --> 33:56.599
and a regime
that doesn't respect

33:56.730 --> 34:00.516
any international regulation
and convention.

34:08.655 --> 34:10.439
It was, like, I don't know,
00 in the morning

34:10.570 --> 34:12.485
or something like that.

34:12.615 --> 34:14.574
I got up groggy
and put on the first clothes

34:14.704 --> 34:16.271
that came to hand.

34:16.402 --> 34:18.186
Ended up
in the operations center

34:18.317 --> 34:20.667
in the State Department.

34:20.797 --> 34:23.365
It had speakers
on a long table,

34:23.496 --> 34:26.890
and each of those speakers
was connected

34:27.021 --> 34:29.328
to a phone inside the embassy,

34:29.458 --> 34:30.546
and we had
conversations back--

34:30.677 --> 34:32.548
"Can you hear anything?"

34:32.679 --> 34:36.204
And then one by one,
the phones suddenly went dead.

34:38.511 --> 34:42.428
That day was
when the first thoughts began

34:42.558 --> 34:46.388
to percolate about ways
to bring pressure on Iran.

34:46.519 --> 34:48.869
No one should underestimate
the resolve

34:48.999 --> 34:50.914
of the American government
and the American people

34:51.045 --> 34:53.091
in this matter.

34:53.221 --> 34:55.658
<i>Carter refused
to hand over the shah, </i>

34:55.789 --> 34:58.400
<i>instead imposing
a raft of sanctions... </i>

34:58.531 --> 35:00.359
I am ordering
that we discontinue

35:00.489 --> 35:04.058
the purchasing
of any oil from Iran.

35:04.189 --> 35:07.888
<i>...as part of an all-out
diplomatic offensive. </i>

35:08.018 --> 35:10.108
The message
the U.S. government

35:10.238 --> 35:12.110
wants to convey is that,
while you're trying

35:12.240 --> 35:15.417
to blackmail us by holding
our citizens hostage,

35:15.548 --> 35:17.071
we're going
to stand our ground.

35:17.202 --> 35:19.508
<i>But Iran's
revolutionary leader </i>

35:19.639 --> 35:21.597
<i>was not just hardnosed.</i>

35:21.728 --> 35:26.124
<i>He had changed the rules
of the game entirely. </i>

35:26.254 --> 35:28.909
Many people thought
he would be the figurehead,

35:29.039 --> 35:32.304
but he had no intention
of being a figurehead.

35:32.434 --> 35:35.045
He was more brutal
than all of them.

35:35.176 --> 35:37.483
As one official here
put it rather gloomily,

35:37.613 --> 35:40.399
you can't expect moderation
from a fanatic,

35:40.529 --> 35:42.923
so it's possible that,
for as long as the shah

35:43.053 --> 35:45.143
remains in this country,

35:45.273 --> 35:47.275
the Americans will remain
as hostages in Iran.

35:49.234 --> 35:52.541
I received a care package
from home,

35:52.672 --> 35:54.413
and it had some books in it--

35:54.543 --> 35:58.330
things like
"Brothers Karamazov,"

35:58.460 --> 36:02.725
"War and Peace,"
"Middlemarch."

36:02.856 --> 36:07.165
Average length about 900 pages.

36:07.295 --> 36:09.819
It was clear someone
was sending me a message

36:09.950 --> 36:11.865
that I was gonna have
plenty of time

36:11.995 --> 36:13.345
to read these books.

36:15.608 --> 36:17.436
<i>What was supposed to be
a quick stunt </i>

36:17.566 --> 36:21.135
<i>turned into weeks,
then months. </i>

36:21.266 --> 36:22.571
<i>Every day,
reporters and cameramen </i>

36:22.702 --> 36:23.964
<i>assemble at the gates.</i>

36:24.094 --> 36:26.401
<i>Thousands of words
are written, </i>

36:26.532 --> 36:28.925
<i>but facts
about the hostages are few. </i>

36:29.056 --> 36:31.798
The rise
of the hostage crisis

36:31.928 --> 36:34.844
coincided
with structural shifts

36:34.975 --> 36:38.108
in how the TV news business
was run,

36:38.239 --> 36:41.416
creating good guys
and bad guys

36:41.547 --> 36:43.592
and a melodramatic arc.

36:43.723 --> 36:47.248
<i>The Iran
America Held Hostage. </i>

36:47.379 --> 36:50.425
<i>ABC News even
launched a nightly program </i>

36:50.556 --> 36:52.122
<i>that made regulars
of hostage families. </i>

36:52.253 --> 36:54.734
<i>We know it today
as "Nightline." </i>

36:54.864 --> 36:56.649
Every morning,
Dotty Morefield

36:56.779 --> 36:58.912
writes to her husband Richard,
now a hostage.

36:59.042 --> 37:01.654
With us now
is Mrs. Morefield.

37:01.784 --> 37:04.874
Ted Koppel became Ted Koppel
as a result of all of this.

37:05.005 --> 37:07.268
<i>The media gave
each of the 53 Americans </i>

37:07.399 --> 37:10.445
<i>being held at the embassy
a face and a story. </i>

37:10.576 --> 37:11.838
21-year-old James Lopez

37:11.968 --> 37:13.970
is one of
the Iranian hostages.

37:14.101 --> 37:16.538
He knows that we're thinking
about him all the time.

37:16.669 --> 37:19.759
Weeping mothers
were a constant feature,

37:19.889 --> 37:22.544
and, you know,
the media celebrated

37:22.675 --> 37:24.546
what it called the rebirth
of American patriotism.

37:24.677 --> 37:27.549
What's on your mind
this Christmas Eve?

37:27.680 --> 37:29.203
The situation in Iran
right now--

37:29.334 --> 37:31.205
I wish the hostages
were back in here

37:31.336 --> 37:32.467
in this country
celebrating Christmas

37:32.598 --> 37:33.729
with their relatives.

37:36.123 --> 37:38.604
<i>In December,
the American news networks </i>

37:38.734 --> 37:40.214
<i>received a tape
from the Iranian students </i>

37:40.345 --> 37:42.695
<i>showing the hostages
participating </i>

37:42.825 --> 37:44.174
<i>in a bizarre
Christmas celebration. </i>

37:44.305 --> 37:46.307
One thing
you learn very quickly

37:46.438 --> 37:48.701
in a situation like this
is nothing's gonna make sense.

37:48.831 --> 37:50.877
All the Americans
here at the embassy

37:51.007 --> 37:52.095
have made
a special Christmas card

37:52.226 --> 37:54.054
to Imam Khomeini.

37:54.184 --> 37:57.536
A Christmas wish
especially for you.

37:57.666 --> 37:59.712
They ask us
to sing Christmas carols,

37:59.842 --> 38:01.714
which nobody wanted to do,
and the whole thing

38:01.844 --> 38:06.066
was so staged
and obviously a show.

38:07.285 --> 38:08.198
The students wanted to use it

38:08.329 --> 38:10.505
for their own purposes
to say,

38:10.636 --> 38:12.202
"Look how nice we are."

38:12.333 --> 38:13.856
<i>The sentimental
news coverage </i>

38:13.987 --> 38:16.294
<i>the hostage crisis
was receiving in America </i>

38:16.424 --> 38:18.731
<i>also gave the revolutionaries
an opening </i>

38:18.861 --> 38:20.950
<i>to once again
address the world. </i>

38:21.081 --> 38:23.866
I asked myself,
"What had the shah done?"

38:23.997 --> 38:26.216
My thinking
started to turn around.

38:26.347 --> 38:28.958
My eyes and mind were starting
to awake to the truth.

38:29.089 --> 38:31.178
The students,
they were very naive.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.789
They thought that Americans--
at least some Americans--

38:33.920 --> 38:35.617
would sympathize
with what they were doing.

38:35.748 --> 38:38.272
How much longer
can you go on doing this?

38:38.403 --> 38:40.840
We are ready to go on
until martyrdom.

38:40.970 --> 38:43.625
<i>
Hermitage, Pennsylvania--</i>

38:43.756 --> 38:46.106
<i>a flag for every day
the hostages have been held. </i>

38:46.236 --> 38:47.629
It would have been
a great moment

38:47.760 --> 38:49.805
to really, like,
explore the history

38:49.936 --> 38:52.460
of our dealings with Iran
and how high-handed

38:52.591 --> 38:54.114
and arrogant we were

38:54.244 --> 38:56.116
in our treatment
of the country,

38:56.246 --> 38:57.944
but we didn't seize
that opportunity,

38:58.074 --> 38:59.989
so we--a lot
of the coverage gave in

39:00.120 --> 39:02.775
to a kind of
nationalistic jingoism

39:02.905 --> 39:05.255
without any kind
of stocktaking of the policies

39:05.386 --> 39:06.953
that had gotten us
to this point.

39:07.083 --> 39:07.997
Down with Khomeini!
He's a murderer!

39:08.128 --> 39:09.608
He's a jerk!

39:09.738 --> 39:10.478
<i>
Yesterday in Houston,</i>

39:10.609 --> 39:12.654
<i>anti-Iranian demonstrators</i>

39:12.785 --> 39:14.874
<i>burned a flag in front
of the Iranian consulate. </i>

39:15.004 --> 39:16.876
<i>That demonstration
symbolizes what appears to be </i>

39:17.006 --> 39:18.834
<i>growing
anti-Iranian sentiment. </i>

39:18.965 --> 39:20.314
<i>Impatience
has turned to bitterness. </i>

39:20.445 --> 39:22.664
I don't see any reason
in this world

39:22.795 --> 39:25.101
for us to have to stand by
twiddling our thumbs.

39:25.232 --> 39:26.886
I feel we should show force.

39:27.016 --> 39:28.540
Let's take
some drastic action.

39:28.670 --> 39:30.585
I mean real drastic.

39:30.716 --> 39:32.065
<i>Pressure on President Carter
increased </i>

39:32.195 --> 39:33.632
<i>with each passing day</i>

39:33.762 --> 39:35.634
<i>the hostages
remained in captivity. </i>

39:35.764 --> 39:37.984
Do you have any plan
to resolve this?

39:38.114 --> 39:39.551
Do you plan to bring
any more pressures on Iran?

39:41.335 --> 39:44.077
We have done everything
we possibly could

39:44.207 --> 39:46.906
in the last four months
to try to preserve

39:47.036 --> 39:50.126
in every way the health
and the lives of those hostages

39:50.257 --> 39:53.652
and to work for their freedom.

39:53.782 --> 39:55.523
I don't know
when they'll be released.

39:56.872 --> 39:59.440
<i>By April of 1980,</i>

39:59.571 --> 40:03.705
<i>Carter felt he had no choice
but to respond with force. </i>

40:03.836 --> 40:06.404
<i>Diplomacy had failed,
and so he ordered </i>

40:06.534 --> 40:09.189
<i>a covert mission
to rescue the hostages. </i>

40:11.539 --> 40:13.541
<i>It would turn out to be
the greatest blunder </i>

40:13.672 --> 40:15.456
<i>of Carter's presidency.</i>

40:18.198 --> 40:19.678
<i>Good morning, everyone.</i>

40:19.808 --> 40:21.288
<i>I'm Tom Brokaw,
and we're starting </i>

40:21.419 --> 40:23.725
<i>at this early hour today
because of major developments </i>

40:23.856 --> 40:25.423
<i>in Iran.</i>

40:25.553 --> 40:27.729
<i>Eight American servicemen
were killed </i>

40:27.860 --> 40:29.862
<i>apparently in the crash
of a helicopter </i>

40:29.992 --> 40:32.995
<i>with a C-130 cargo plane
in Iran </i>

40:33.126 --> 40:34.910
<i>during a secret
United States mission </i>

40:35.041 --> 40:35.911
<i>to rescue the hostages.</i>

40:38.436 --> 40:40.089
My name's Jim Schaefer,

40:40.220 --> 40:43.441
major, United States
Marine Corps CH-53 pilot

40:43.571 --> 40:45.486
and a member
of the Iranian rescue attempt.

40:47.749 --> 40:50.752
It was just a loud thud.

40:50.883 --> 40:53.146
After that, I don't remember
much of anything.

40:53.276 --> 40:55.931
Waking up, and I know
the aircraft was on fire.

40:57.193 --> 40:58.760
So...

41:00.196 --> 41:01.937
This is the core
of the tragedy--

41:02.068 --> 41:03.722
the entire rotor assembly

41:03.852 --> 41:05.288
of one of
the American helicopters

41:05.419 --> 41:06.942
that were involved
in the rescue attempt.

41:12.295 --> 41:14.210
The molten aluminum
marked the intense heat

41:14.341 --> 41:16.343
of the blaze which followed,

41:16.474 --> 41:18.432
so intense that no American
could get near

41:18.563 --> 41:20.739
to drag clear the bodies
in the wreckage.

41:22.436 --> 41:25.831
It's just a horrible feeling
of failure,

41:25.961 --> 41:27.963
of letting our country down,
of letting the people,

41:28.094 --> 41:30.357
our troops down.

41:30.488 --> 41:33.534
It was really, really, really
a dark place.

41:38.844 --> 41:41.455
<i>News of the crash
ricocheted across Iran. </i>

41:41.586 --> 41:43.457
<i>
Word of the mission itself</i>

41:43.588 --> 41:45.981
<i>came as many thousands
of people were attending </i>

41:46.112 --> 41:48.723
<i>Friday prayers
at Tehran University. </i>

41:48.854 --> 41:50.072
<i>They heard it on their radios,</i>

41:50.203 --> 41:50.812
<i>and then there was
an announcement </i>

41:50.943 --> 41:52.031
<i>via the speaker.</i>

41:53.815 --> 41:54.990
<i>
That was a miracle.</i>

41:56.209 --> 42:00.126
That was divine support

42:00.256 --> 42:02.520
to Islamic revolution.

42:04.173 --> 42:06.088
I mean, the propaganda
was that

42:06.219 --> 42:07.525
<i>it was by the order of God.</i>

42:17.099 --> 42:20.799
I was able
to steal a newspaper.

42:20.929 --> 42:23.192
Not a lot of details,
but it was enough to know

42:23.323 --> 42:25.151
that there had been
a rescue attempt,

42:25.281 --> 42:28.328
that it had failed.

42:28.458 --> 42:30.330
After the raid,
we were scattered

42:30.460 --> 42:31.244
around the country.

42:33.942 --> 42:35.640
And I ended up
at Evin Prison,

42:35.770 --> 42:37.206
which is, like,

42:37.337 --> 42:38.773
one of the worst prisons
in the world,

42:38.904 --> 42:41.167
and I was way, way underground

42:41.297 --> 42:45.171
in a very small cell,

42:45.301 --> 42:47.260
and so I decide, okay,
I'm gonna take my own life.

42:47.390 --> 42:49.915
This is what I'm gonna do
because this is metal,

42:50.045 --> 42:52.178
and I played football
when I was younger and that,

42:52.308 --> 42:56.878
so I'm just gonna crash my head
into that door.

42:57.009 --> 42:58.445
And then I thought about it,
and I said,

42:58.576 --> 43:02.362
"Oh...that's real bright.

43:02.492 --> 43:03.755
You're not gonna die.

43:03.885 --> 43:04.669
You're just gonna
put yourself..."

43:06.366 --> 43:07.889
"You're gonna make
yourself irrelevant."

43:08.020 --> 43:11.980
I'd like to send a message
to the American people

43:12.111 --> 43:14.417
and the people of the world.

43:14.548 --> 43:17.464
I'd like to thank
all of them for the support

43:17.595 --> 43:19.901
that they have shown for us.

43:20.032 --> 43:21.468
There were sort of
really mixed emotions.

43:21.599 --> 43:24.776
Two things--one was,
of course, great sadness

43:24.906 --> 43:27.996
that brave people had died...

43:28.127 --> 43:30.564
in the attempt to get us out.

43:30.695 --> 43:33.219
The other, of course,
was great pride

43:33.349 --> 43:35.743
that, no,
we were not forgotten.

43:37.353 --> 43:40.879
Our rescue team knew
and I knew

43:41.009 --> 43:43.011
that the operation
was certain to be difficult,

43:43.142 --> 43:45.666
and it was certain
to be dangerous.

43:45.797 --> 43:48.843
To the families of those
who died and who were wounded,

43:48.974 --> 43:51.454
I want to express
the admiration I feel

43:51.585 --> 43:54.414
for the courage
of their loved ones

43:54.544 --> 43:55.807
and the sorrow
that I feel personally

43:55.937 --> 43:58.113
for their sacrifice.

43:58.244 --> 44:01.421
It was my decision to attempt
the rescue operation.

44:03.205 --> 44:06.426
The responsibility
is fully my own.

44:06.556 --> 44:09.081
To say, "Look,
this was my decision,

44:09.211 --> 44:13.215
and I take
full responsibility for it,"

44:13.346 --> 44:15.914
was a very hard thing
for him to do.

44:16.044 --> 44:18.960
It's a hard thing
for any president to do,

44:19.091 --> 44:20.962
and especially
a president who's involved

44:21.093 --> 44:23.704
in a very difficult
reelection campaign.

44:28.753 --> 44:30.624
<i>When Dorothea
Morefield heard the news, </i>

44:30.755 --> 44:32.321
<i>she did not know
what to make of it. </i>

44:32.452 --> 44:34.280
<i>Mrs. Morefield
kept switching channels </i>

44:34.410 --> 44:36.021
<i>looking for more information
on what happened. </i>

44:36.151 --> 44:37.631
They're Americans.

44:37.762 --> 44:38.806
They went in
to try and get them out,

44:38.937 --> 44:41.026
and I feel so badly.

44:41.156 --> 44:42.810
Do you think that it
will endanger Richard?

44:42.941 --> 44:44.682
I'm scared to death.

44:44.812 --> 44:48.163
It was yet one more image
of American humiliation

44:48.294 --> 44:51.384
to visit our television screens
every night.

44:51.514 --> 44:52.428
Are you concerned now
about the hostages?

44:52.559 --> 44:54.343
Very much so.

44:54.474 --> 44:56.302
I heard on the radio
this morning

44:56.432 --> 44:59.044
the mother of Rosen,
and she was crying bitterly

44:59.174 --> 45:01.263
and said that the president
was all wrong.

45:01.394 --> 45:06.051
After the abortive
rescue effort in Iran,

45:06.181 --> 45:07.835
one lady said, "My God,
can't we do anything right?"

45:13.101 --> 45:15.495
<i>Carter's failed mission
was red meat </i>

45:15.625 --> 45:17.366
<i>for televangelist
Jerry Falwell </i>

45:17.497 --> 45:19.020
<i>and his budding
political coalition </i>

45:19.151 --> 45:21.283
<i>of evangelicals.</i>

45:21.414 --> 45:23.155
<i>By this point,</i>

45:23.285 --> 45:25.374
<i>Falwell had given
this coalition a name-- </i>

45:25.505 --> 45:27.550
<i>the Moral Majority.</i>

45:27.681 --> 45:29.161
We are not preempted

45:29.291 --> 45:30.945
from going into
the political arena

45:31.076 --> 45:32.425
and fighting the battle there.

45:32.555 --> 45:34.514
As a matter of fact,
we're obligated to do it.

45:36.908 --> 45:39.127
<i>Mixing politics
with religion is a turnaround </i>

45:39.258 --> 45:41.303
<i>for this evangelist,
and he defends it vigorously. </i>

45:41.434 --> 45:43.001
If America's worth saving,

45:43.131 --> 45:45.090
then the preachers
need to fearlessly

45:45.220 --> 45:46.700
declare the issues

45:46.831 --> 45:49.094
no matter how unpopular
they may be.

45:51.183 --> 45:53.489
Evangelical
political involvement,

45:53.620 --> 45:57.319
it is ultimately a witness
of two things--

45:57.450 --> 46:02.368
our desire to serve others,
including those less fortunate,

46:02.498 --> 46:06.024
and our desire to share
our love for our God.

46:06.154 --> 46:08.026
Just pass
the envelopes out, please.

46:08.156 --> 46:09.592
Print your name and address.

46:09.723 --> 46:12.770
Make your checks payable
to Moral Majority.

46:12.900 --> 46:16.730
Make them as generous
as you can, please.

46:16.861 --> 46:19.994
By 1980, Jimmy Carter
is the enemy

46:20.125 --> 46:22.083
for a lot of these people.

46:22.214 --> 46:23.998
And I know people
have been telling me

46:24.129 --> 46:26.261
that Jimmy Carter's
doing his best,

46:26.392 --> 46:27.959
and that's our problem.

46:29.569 --> 46:31.310
<i>
To the nation's evangelicals,</i>

46:31.440 --> 46:33.878
<i>Ronald Reagan was a politician
who spoke their language. </i>

46:36.968 --> 46:41.146
Even though he was divorced
and he came out of Hollywood,

46:41.276 --> 46:44.627
there was great identification
with him rhetorically,

46:44.758 --> 46:46.499
and he welcomed them.

46:48.370 --> 46:51.547
He, at this time,
is standing firmly

46:51.678 --> 46:54.637
for those moral issues that we
are very concerned about.

46:54.768 --> 46:56.596
<i>And when it came
to the hostage crisis, </i>

46:56.726 --> 46:59.077
<i>Reagan's point of view
was simple. </i>

46:59.207 --> 47:02.515
I don't understand
why 52 Americans

47:02.645 --> 47:04.604
have been held hostage
for almost a year now.

47:06.519 --> 47:09.087
<i>Strong-arm Iran
and get the hostages back. </i>

47:09.217 --> 47:10.784
It was absolutely
at the center

47:10.915 --> 47:12.786
of his political
and moral imagination

47:12.917 --> 47:15.049
that America rescued
its hostages.

47:15.180 --> 47:16.616
We've endured
this humiliation

47:16.746 --> 47:18.618
for just lacking one week
of a year now.

47:18.748 --> 47:20.489
So, you know,
if you wanted to vote

47:20.620 --> 47:22.056
for a hawk, you know,
you might as well

47:22.187 --> 47:23.579
vote for the guy
who promised you

47:23.710 --> 47:25.277
a 30% tax cut
over the guy who tells you

47:25.407 --> 47:26.191
you're gonna have
to make do with less.

47:28.193 --> 47:31.761
This country
needs a new administration

47:31.892 --> 47:35.243
with a renewed dedication
to the dream of an America,

47:35.374 --> 47:38.029
an administration that will
give that dream new life.

47:38.159 --> 47:42.468
We will
make America great again.

47:44.862 --> 47:49.388
The greatness of America
as a city set upon a hill

47:49.518 --> 47:52.391
that would be a moral example
to the rest of the world

47:52.521 --> 47:55.611
that the rest of the world
would want to emulate--

47:55.742 --> 47:58.571
particularly for evangelicals,

47:58.701 --> 48:02.183
that was a very powerful view
of America.

48:02.314 --> 48:06.666
Inside this little packet
is an Old Glory flag pin.

48:06.796 --> 48:08.581
Now, if you're ashamed
of America, don't wear it.

48:08.711 --> 48:11.192
Go on over and join Khomeini.

48:11.323 --> 48:13.412
You might say it was
a marriage made in heaven.

48:13.542 --> 48:15.109
Heyo.

48:15.240 --> 48:17.764
Religious America
is awakening

48:17.895 --> 48:21.115
perhaps just in time
for our country's sake.

48:26.642 --> 48:28.296
Just to bring you up to date
on the presidential race,

48:28.427 --> 48:30.385
it is looking very good
for Ronald Reagan at this time.

48:30.516 --> 48:32.300
It's a tremendous landslide.

48:32.431 --> 48:35.173
Unanticipated, unexpected.

48:35.303 --> 48:37.523
The hostage thing came in
in a sneaky way,

48:37.653 --> 48:39.133
and it just collapsed
for Carter.

48:39.264 --> 48:41.266
And all of this arrived
on top of inflation,

48:41.396 --> 48:42.876
unemployment, and so on--

48:43.007 --> 48:44.138
all of the problems
we know about.

48:44.269 --> 48:47.794
And roughly 25%

48:47.925 --> 48:51.363
of all voters told pollsters

48:51.493 --> 48:53.452
they were regular viewers
of Christian television.

48:55.236 --> 48:57.238
<i>Carter only won six states.</i>

48:57.369 --> 48:59.762
<i>It was a wipeout.</i>

49:05.812 --> 49:09.163
I promised you four years ago

49:09.294 --> 49:12.297
that I would never lie to you,

49:12.427 --> 49:14.734
so I can't stand here tonight
and say it doesn't hurt.

49:22.394 --> 49:24.439
In all the days and months
when I have served you

49:24.570 --> 49:26.267
and served this country,

49:26.398 --> 49:28.791
you've readily given me
your shoulders,

49:28.922 --> 49:31.794
your faith, and your prayers.

49:31.925 --> 49:34.667
No man could ask any more
of his friends.

49:36.277 --> 49:39.585
He wasn't a showman,

49:39.715 --> 49:43.241
but he really
gave the American people

49:43.371 --> 49:47.462
full value for their election.

49:47.593 --> 49:50.248
Jimmy Carter actually asked
the American people to think

49:50.378 --> 49:54.339
and to take
their job seriously,

49:54.469 --> 49:58.647
and a lot of people
really do appreciate that

49:58.778 --> 50:00.998
and understand it,

50:01.128 --> 50:03.043
and I think a lot
of other people really don't.

50:05.437 --> 50:06.307
Do the Carter people feel
that they could have

50:06.438 --> 50:08.353
done it differently?

50:08.483 --> 50:10.616
Any one single thing
they should have done better.

50:10.746 --> 50:14.576
John, they point constantly
to this hostage situation.

50:14.707 --> 50:17.231
<i>Even after his loss,
Carter continued </i>

50:17.362 --> 50:19.929
<i>to negotiate for the hostages,</i>

50:20.060 --> 50:23.237
<i>but Iran continued
to deny him a resolution </i>

50:23.368 --> 50:24.673
<i>right up until
the very last minute </i>

50:24.804 --> 50:25.805
<i>of his presidency.</i>

50:30.984 --> 50:32.942
<i>
Live from Washington D.C.,</i>

50:33.073 --> 50:35.162
<i>NBC News
covers the inauguration </i>

50:35.293 --> 50:36.642
<i>of Ronald Reagan.</i>

50:43.823 --> 50:46.652
Well, the night before,
oh, about00,

50:46.782 --> 50:48.306
00 at night,
they came in,

50:48.436 --> 50:49.698
and they said,
"We're letting you go."

50:55.487 --> 50:58.490
That day, I was
in the Oval Office.

50:58.620 --> 51:00.492
Both planes
at the end of the runway.

51:00.622 --> 51:02.929
And then we started
to get notices

51:03.060 --> 51:05.236
the hostages were moving.

51:05.366 --> 51:06.541
We'll let you know
when to take off.

51:06.672 --> 51:08.674
What is--that's close.

51:08.804 --> 51:11.894
We were sitting in a room.

51:12.025 --> 51:14.419
These guys exploded
in there saying,

51:14.549 --> 51:16.421
"Get your stuff.
Let's go."

51:16.551 --> 51:18.249
They took off our blindfolds,
and we walked

51:18.379 --> 51:19.554
towards the airplane.

51:21.469 --> 51:22.949
We do think
that the hostages

51:23.080 --> 51:26.039
will be leaving Tehran Airport
before long.

51:26.170 --> 51:28.694
The idea that the release
would come

51:28.824 --> 51:31.871
within minutes of Ronald Reagan
raising his right hand

51:32.001 --> 51:36.571
is to be believed
in fiction only.

51:36.702 --> 51:39.661
Reagan arrived on the steps
of the White House,

51:39.792 --> 51:43.404
and Carter went down,
got in the car with him.

51:43.535 --> 51:46.364
So at that point
I left and went down

51:46.494 --> 51:48.627
to the operations center
in the basement,

51:48.757 --> 51:51.238
and I followed the situation.

51:56.243 --> 51:58.376
Were people talking about
the hostages down there?

51:58.506 --> 52:00.943
Someone said
that they were airborne.

52:01.074 --> 52:02.293
Mr. President,
are the hostages out?

52:02.423 --> 52:03.990
Can't say yet.

52:04.121 --> 52:05.818
Not yet.
They've cheated him.

52:05.948 --> 52:07.733
They've cheated him
right down to the end.

52:10.039 --> 52:13.521
Reverend Falwell,
what does this day mean to you?

52:13.652 --> 52:16.307
I think this is a day with
a real supernatural meaning.

52:16.437 --> 52:19.701
I--the hostages'
potential release,

52:19.832 --> 52:22.095
a new president,
a new administration.

52:22.226 --> 52:23.575
Perhaps God
may give to this country

52:23.705 --> 52:24.793
a new beginning.

52:28.971 --> 52:31.409
Raise your right hand
and repeat after me.

52:31.539 --> 52:33.933
I, Ronald Reagan,
do solemnly swear...

52:34.063 --> 52:36.631
I, Ronald Reagan, do
solemnly swear...

52:36.762 --> 52:38.938
...that I will faithfully
execute the office

52:39.068 --> 52:40.940
of president
of the United States.

52:41.070 --> 52:42.768
...that I will
faithfully execute

52:42.898 --> 52:44.944
the office of president
of the United States.

52:45.074 --> 52:48.774
- So help you God.
- So help me God.

52:48.904 --> 52:51.429
<i>Minutes after Reagan
raised his right hand, </i>

52:51.559 --> 52:52.647
<i>the plane
carrying the hostages </i>

52:52.778 --> 52:55.433
<i>left the ground in Tehran.</i>

52:58.000 --> 53:00.873
The stands are filled.

53:01.003 --> 53:02.701
The weather is easy.

53:02.831 --> 53:05.617
- The hostages are free.
- Hooray!

53:05.747 --> 53:08.924
Looks as though
President Reagan

53:09.055 --> 53:11.840
has been spared the requirement
of dealing on the hostages.

53:11.971 --> 53:13.451
<i>Spared for now.</i>

53:15.627 --> 53:20.719
Reagan was allowed
to bask in this victory

53:20.849 --> 53:23.461
that the hostages had returned
safe and sound by and large.

53:25.767 --> 53:28.770
<i>And the cheering
begins even before we see </i>

53:28.901 --> 53:30.337
<i>the first
of the returning Americans. </i>

53:32.644 --> 53:35.124
<i>This is one of the first
national experiences </i>

53:35.255 --> 53:38.911
<i>that America's had in years
in which everybody feels good. </i>

53:39.041 --> 53:40.521
How are you?
Nice to see you.

53:40.652 --> 53:41.435
I didn't know
what I was coming back to.

53:41.566 --> 53:44.482
I thought, "Wow, boy,

53:44.612 --> 53:46.527
are we gonna be
in some trouble."

53:46.658 --> 53:52.011
And, of course, we were
just treated like gold.

53:52.141 --> 53:54.405
John Limbert believes
that wholesale condemnation

53:54.535 --> 53:56.537
of the Iranian people
is wrong.

53:56.668 --> 53:58.887
I do say they're people
of talent,

53:59.018 --> 54:02.239
ability, great kindness,
great hospitality.

54:02.369 --> 54:04.284
That's what I thought before.
I still think so.

54:06.634 --> 54:08.375
<i>Seven days
after taking office... </i>

54:11.204 --> 54:13.293
<i>...Reagan welcomed
the hostages home </i>

54:13.424 --> 54:16.296
<i>with a patriotic celebration
fit for American heroes. </i>

54:20.648 --> 54:24.696
You come home to a people
who for 444 days

54:24.826 --> 54:27.481
suffered the pain
of your imprisonment,

54:27.612 --> 54:29.918
prayed for your safety,
and most importantly

54:30.049 --> 54:32.225
shared your determination

54:32.356 --> 54:34.053
that the spirit
of free men and women

54:34.183 --> 54:36.751
is not a fit subject
for barter.

54:40.059 --> 54:42.235
Now, I'll not be
so foolish as to say,

54:42.366 --> 54:43.584
"Forget what
you've been through."

54:43.715 --> 54:46.065
You never will.

54:46.195 --> 54:48.633
But turn the page
and look ahead.

54:50.287 --> 54:52.854
To me,
that's Reaganism to a T--

54:52.985 --> 54:54.987
the idea that history

54:55.117 --> 54:57.250
is not something
to learn from,

54:57.381 --> 55:00.558
that we don't
transcend our traumas

55:00.688 --> 55:02.908
by facing them unflinchingly,

55:03.038 --> 55:07.042
but that we kind of create
this sort of fantasy America

55:07.173 --> 55:09.218
in which
there are no problems,

55:09.349 --> 55:11.003
except for problems
that are kind of visited

55:11.133 --> 55:13.266
upon America from,
you know, forces

55:13.397 --> 55:14.528
that are not really
American at all.

55:15.312 --> 55:17.662
Let terrorists be aware

55:17.792 --> 55:19.968
that when the rules
of international behavior

55:20.099 --> 55:22.971
are violated,
our policy will be one

55:23.102 --> 55:26.584
of swift
and effective retribution.

55:28.368 --> 55:32.285
And then five years later,
it comes up again.

55:32.416 --> 55:34.374
<i>And that's how we get back
to Iran-Contra... </i>

55:36.463 --> 55:38.160
<i>...when Ronald Reagan
found himself </i>

55:38.291 --> 55:40.511
<i>enveloped in a hostage crisis
of his own. </i>

55:42.251 --> 55:43.818
<i>Reagan had reached
the White House </i>

55:43.949 --> 55:45.690
<i>in part by attacking
his opponent's approach </i>

55:45.820 --> 55:48.301
<i>to the same exact problem.</i>

55:48.432 --> 55:50.608
<i>In doing so,
the new president </i>

55:50.738 --> 55:52.740
<i>had painted himself
into a corner, </i>

55:52.871 --> 55:55.656
<i>a hostage of his own making.</i>

55:55.787 --> 55:58.267
And maybe
that's the Greek tragedy--

55:58.398 --> 56:01.706
that you cannot
escape your fate.

56:01.836 --> 56:03.708
<i>The hearing
will please come to order. </i>
