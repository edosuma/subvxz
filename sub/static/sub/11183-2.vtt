00:24.725 --> 00:26.329
We're approaching foreign territory.

00:26.393 --> 00:29.772
It's about this picture.
Which one is my Father?

00:29.830 --> 00:32.037
What would you do if it was your son?

00:32.098 --> 00:33.305
MiGs on our 6.

00:37.938 --> 00:39.178
He's a traitor.

00:39.239 --> 00:40.684
So how do you tell them from us?

00:40.741 --> 00:42.118
We wear white hats.

00:42.175 --> 00:45.179
Now all we have to do is
attack Russia, steal a kid,

00:45.245 --> 00:47.282
and try not to get caught
by our own government.

03:27.908 --> 03:31.446
How would you like to see your Father?

03:32.713 --> 03:33.748
Come on.

03:33.814 --> 03:36.624
I know they taught you English
before they shut down the orphanage.

03:36.683 --> 03:38.492
And I speak lousy Vietnamese.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.929
You are Ho Minh Truong, right?

03:48.862 --> 03:52.639
My Father is in America. He's a pilot.

03:53.800 --> 03:56.610
He's gone. My Mother, too.

04:00.340 --> 04:01.444
Answer my question.

04:01.508 --> 04:03.852
How would you like to see your Father?

04:09.549 --> 04:11.324
Want to try it again, Dom?

04:11.384 --> 04:13.990
What would you do if I was paid overtime?

04:22.763 --> 04:26.336
0.98, Mach point 0.99.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.238
Mach 1.

04:28.301 --> 04:30.076
Prepare to retrograde in 10 seconds.

04:30.137 --> 04:31.582
Do I have a choice?

04:31.638 --> 04:33.584
8 seconds… 6…

04:33.640 --> 04:36.280
Why can't we hover like
regular helicopter people?

04:36.343 --> 04:37.413
4 seconds.

04:37.477 --> 04:38.979
This is a hell of a way to stop a…

04:39.045 --> 04:40.217
2…

04:41.381 --> 04:42.621
Now.

04:42.749 --> 04:44.387
Turbos off

04:52.125 --> 04:53.229
I need more power.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.795
Engaging rotors.

04:57.931 --> 04:59.103
I need more power.

04:59.166 --> 05:00.304
You've got it all.

05:00.367 --> 05:02.313
Abort! Give me back the turbos.

05:17.918 --> 05:19.522
I was lousy?

05:22.122 --> 05:23.795
We're alive.

05:23.924 --> 05:25.631
Yeah, but I was lousy.

05:25.692 --> 05:27.638
Need a little more practice.

05:28.028 --> 05:30.030
Yeah, maybe tomorrow, String.

05:30.497 --> 05:32.704
I'll be on straight time then.

05:58.024 --> 06:01.369
It shouldn't take more than a couple of weeks.

06:02.529 --> 06:05.032
It's not like you'd be missing anything.

06:05.098 --> 06:06.907
Well, maybe some cello music

06:06.967 --> 06:09.504
and the mellow mating tones
of the red-tipped sparrow,

06:09.569 --> 06:11.549
but I can always send you a cassette of that.

06:11.605 --> 06:13.676
You can't send me pure, fresh air.

06:13.740 --> 06:17.210
You'll be flying Radar Officer
on a high-altitude recon jet.

06:17.277 --> 06:19.086
You'll be on oxygen most of the time.

06:19.145 --> 06:20.920
What's purer than oxygen?

06:21.381 --> 06:23.258
Forget the view. Forget fresh air.

06:23.316 --> 06:26.058
I'm talking about an American
pilot who's going to steal

06:26.119 --> 06:27.462
our hottest tactical aircraft

06:27.520 --> 06:29.761
and deliver it to the Russians.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.535
Somebody's got to stop him.

06:31.591 --> 06:33.036
We don't know who he is.

06:33.093 --> 06:35.130
We only know that the plan is to steal one

06:35.195 --> 06:37.402
when we deploy the first planes next week.

06:37.464 --> 06:39.341
He could be any one of those pilots.

06:39.399 --> 06:40.434
Replace them.

06:40.500 --> 06:41.478
We can't.

06:41.534 --> 06:44.481
The ferry pilots are also the
training officers after delivery.

06:44.537 --> 06:48.383
Replacing them could slow everything
down by at least 6 months.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.190
What a shame.

07:00.987 --> 07:04.525
A multi-million dollar plane is about
to be handed over to the Russians

07:04.591 --> 07:07.800
and your classification
of the problem is "shame."

07:08.061 --> 07:09.438
I compliment you.

07:09.496 --> 07:11.498
Your mastery of silence is exceeded

07:11.564 --> 07:13.475
only by your facility at understatement.

07:13.533 --> 07:15.979
But measuring this with the word "shame"

07:16.036 --> 07:19.540
surpasses all your previous
achievements in articulation.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.051
Why, thank you.

07:21.608 --> 07:25.215
Since you seem to be removed from
the problems of the world today,

07:25.545 --> 07:27.786
perhaps we should bring you up-to-date.

07:27.981 --> 07:30.825
You see, there are these bad guys.

07:31.384 --> 07:33.421
They're called the Russians.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.290
I think I've heard of them.

07:35.722 --> 07:37.167
And then there's us.

07:37.223 --> 07:38.634
What do they call us?

07:38.692 --> 07:40.763
It varies in different parts of the world,

07:40.794 --> 07:43.468
but for the sake of this conversation,

07:43.830 --> 07:45.867
we'll call ourselves the "good guys."

07:45.932 --> 07:47.878
So how do you tell them from us?

07:47.934 --> 07:49.311
That's easy.

07:49.369 --> 07:51.042
We wear white hats.

07:52.605 --> 07:55.245
You'd look good in a white hat, Mr. Hawke.

07:55.308 --> 07:56.582
Very good.

08:01.581 --> 08:02.719
Well,

08:03.583 --> 08:05.995
I guess we'd better get one for Dominic, too.

08:06.052 --> 08:09.192
Dominic will never pass as a military pilot.

08:10.857 --> 08:12.700
We'll work somethin' out.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.029
They're great.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.745
Sure glad they're ours.

08:58.138 --> 08:59.913
Hey, if you're going for a tan,

08:59.973 --> 09:02.783
I'd suggest you slip out of that flight suit.

09:02.842 --> 09:04.583
What are you starin' at?

09:05.145 --> 09:08.092
You remember an Army Captain in Nam
by the name of Stringfellow Hawke?

09:08.148 --> 09:09.889
Flew Hueys.

09:10.350 --> 09:12.557
He pulled me out of Indian territory once.

09:12.619 --> 09:13.825
Good reason to remember.

09:13.887 --> 09:16.299
Who could forget a name
like Stringfellow Hawke?

09:16.356 --> 09:17.892
Said he was gonna fly civilian.

09:17.957 --> 09:19.334
Been assigned here.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.429
On the Army exchange program.

09:21.494 --> 09:22.996
No kiddin'.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.373
He probably couldn't make it on the outside.

09:26.866 --> 09:30.245
Some of us just make lousy
civilians, you know what I mean?

09:44.317 --> 09:45.819
See you later, Chief.

10:04.838 --> 10:07.751
Do you still expect people
to read your silences?

10:12.412 --> 10:14.619
Only if I don't know what to say.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.491
It's been 10 years, Nhi Huong.

10:19.552 --> 10:21.657
A little over 11.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.400
Did you look for me?

10:29.863 --> 10:32.309
By the time I got out of the hospital,

10:32.699 --> 10:33.905
Saigon had fallen.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.241
Did you try?

10:37.103 --> 10:38.480
Does it matter?

10:39.973 --> 10:40.974
No.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.386
What are you doing here?

10:45.612 --> 10:48.024
Trying to bring my family together.

10:56.723 --> 10:58.964
I've been hanging around here waiting for you

10:59.025 --> 11:00.163
for 10 minutes.

11:00.226 --> 11:03.469
You know what they call guys
that hang around men's rooms?

11:03.530 --> 11:05.134
What do you want? A tip?

11:05.198 --> 11:07.644
Look, I said I'd be your cover,

11:07.700 --> 11:10.647
but you could have made me a
pilot or a mechanic, but no.

11:10.703 --> 11:12.740
I told you, I need you on and off the base.

11:12.805 --> 11:14.443
Nobody notices a guy with a mop.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.487
They do in a room like this.

11:16.543 --> 11:18.045
Just a minute, we want privacy.

11:18.111 --> 11:20.455
Hold the… hold the flying
pattern for a minute, will you?

11:20.513 --> 11:23.084
We're changin' the ice in the head.

11:24.884 --> 11:26.386
We've got privacy.

11:28.655 --> 11:30.794
There's a Nhi Huong Truong on the base.

11:30.857 --> 11:33.235
I want to know her status
and reason for being here.

11:33.293 --> 11:34.567
Personal or business?

11:34.627 --> 11:35.765
Personal.

11:36.496 --> 11:37.839
Don't press it.

11:38.298 --> 11:40.642
What did you learn from those guys out there?

11:40.700 --> 11:43.579
That their capacity for
alcohol hasn't diminished.

11:43.636 --> 11:45.912
You better duck into a stall
before I let this guy in

11:45.972 --> 11:47.974
or you're gonna get some funny looks.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.385
For what? I'm an officer…

11:50.944 --> 11:52.321
and a gentlemen.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.198
Nhi Huong Truong.

12:03.022 --> 12:04.592
If his Mother was still in Vietnam,

12:04.657 --> 12:06.659
you think he'd tell you where?

12:11.064 --> 12:13.271
He's never even seen his Father.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.745
All this is unnecessary.

12:16.135 --> 12:17.876
Look, you're supposed to be helping me,

12:17.937 --> 12:19.439
not holding an interrogation.

12:19.505 --> 12:21.485
Would you please just sign the visa form?

12:21.541 --> 12:25.148
Mr. Zimmer, this is my country, not yours.

12:26.312 --> 12:29.122
I decide what is necessary here or not.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.958
As long as it doesn't
take more than 20 minutes.

12:32.185 --> 12:34.791
My country runs on a precise schedule.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.680
His Father is whoever I say he is.

12:59.345 --> 13:01.848
Now you just sign the visa and say goodbye,

13:02.115 --> 13:04.459
because I know what your orders are.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.457
We're on our 5th bottle here

13:37.517 --> 13:40.020
and we have yet to have a legitimate toast.

13:40.086 --> 13:42.362
Not enough booze in us to get that silly.

13:42.422 --> 13:44.766
It's not silly, it's a
responsibility to the champagne.

13:44.824 --> 13:45.996
It's a… it's a formality.

13:46.059 --> 13:48.198
It's not like we're drinkin'
a case of beer here.

13:48.261 --> 13:50.366
Okay, okay, that's enough.

13:50.963 --> 13:54.001
Who has anything nice

13:54.300 --> 13:56.871
to say about Stringfellow Hawke?

14:09.048 --> 14:10.186
He's quiet.

14:10.249 --> 14:11.887
That's good. He's quiet. That's good.

14:11.951 --> 14:12.986
He's pretty.

14:13.086 --> 14:15.999
He's pretty. That's good.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.567
He looks nice in that new uniform, too.

14:18.624 --> 14:20.228
Not that nice.

14:20.293 --> 14:22.170
I think you're right about that.

14:22.261 --> 14:25.367
Maybe we ought to stick
with, "He's pretty quiet."

14:27.266 --> 14:29.610
Here's to Hawke. Welcome home.

14:30.269 --> 14:32.681
Wait a minute. Hold it.
There's more to the ceremony.

14:32.739 --> 14:35.777
You've got to make a speech, Hawke. Stand up

14:36.609 --> 14:39.783
and be a fool, or all this don't count.

14:54.694 --> 14:56.230
I got to go to the bathroom.

15:02.068 --> 15:03.240
Okay, Josh, my boy,

15:03.302 --> 15:05.179
why don't you give me a little port rudder

15:05.238 --> 15:07.616
and pull your nose up about 5°.

15:07.673 --> 15:09.983
Can't you just say take a
left turn and don't fall?

15:10.042 --> 15:11.646
That wouldn't be military, would it?

15:11.711 --> 15:12.985
Right. Right.

15:14.180 --> 15:15.454
And we're not fit

15:15.515 --> 15:18.655
for the world of civilians and humans, right?

15:19.652 --> 15:20.687
It's different.

15:20.753 --> 15:23.199
Different. Different.

15:24.657 --> 15:26.534
You know, for guys like us, it's like a,

15:26.592 --> 15:28.663
it's a ballpark with no fences.

15:28.728 --> 15:31.004
There's no way to hit a home run.

15:31.497 --> 15:33.875
But if you don't get a hit once in a while,

15:33.900 --> 15:37.780
they're… they're just waiting to beat on you

15:37.904 --> 15:40.384
and tell you you're not fit for anything

15:40.440 --> 15:42.647
besides burnin' out villages.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.286
Tried his luck as a civilian
a couple of years ago.

15:45.344 --> 15:46.755
It kicked him around pretty good.

15:46.813 --> 15:48.622
Don't talk for me, Sam.

15:49.949 --> 15:52.930
You know, I've been wearing blue uniforms

15:52.952 --> 15:55.364
since… since my first shave.

15:55.421 --> 15:57.958
Yeah, I… I've been into this

15:58.057 --> 16:00.697
wave the flag and go for broke business

16:00.760 --> 16:03.400
since I, since I traded in my virginity

16:03.429 --> 16:06.603
for a pair of wings and a,
and a fancy football helmet

16:06.666 --> 16:07.701
with a microphone in it.

16:07.767 --> 16:09.405
And you wanna know something?

16:09.469 --> 16:11.471
You want to know something?

16:11.537 --> 16:14.279
You know, it all don't mean nothin'

16:15.107 --> 16:19.055
outside of this prefabricated
world that we live in here.

16:23.382 --> 16:25.362
Could be bull! It is.

16:26.452 --> 16:28.728
I… I went out into the world

16:29.388 --> 16:31.493
of worsteds and attaché cases

16:31.557 --> 16:34.367
and I was introduced around
as the resident freak.

16:35.127 --> 16:36.731
Oh, I mean, they… they treat you nice

16:36.796 --> 16:38.935
and all that kind of social puke

16:39.732 --> 16:42.770
and then they, they wanted to see my medals.

16:43.469 --> 16:46.814
And then they asked me how many people

16:47.073 --> 16:50.179
I figured I… I burned to death

16:50.243 --> 16:51.517
at 4,000 feet.

16:51.577 --> 16:54.057
'Cause they don't know. They don't care.

16:54.647 --> 16:57.184
I spent 3 years of my life in hell.

16:57.783 --> 16:59.854
And they don't give a damn.

17:00.219 --> 17:02.722
It don't have nothin’ to do with them.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.469
Then who the hell are we doing it for?

17:05.525 --> 17:07.266
I do it for myself.

17:12.198 --> 17:13.733
Let go of me, Sam.

17:15.768 --> 17:18.544
I can stagger without any help at all.

17:23.542 --> 17:25.614
How long has he been like that?

17:25.912 --> 17:28.415
Since they passed him over for promotion.

17:30.983 --> 17:32.485
When was that?

17:32.552 --> 17:33.929
Over a year ago.

17:36.322 --> 17:37.858
And before?

17:37.924 --> 17:39.403
What in the hell are you up to?

17:39.458 --> 17:40.528
My job.

17:40.593 --> 17:41.731
Which is?

17:43.129 --> 17:46.042
Working with you as an exchange pilot.

17:46.098 --> 17:48.305
That's what your orders say.
You have as much business

17:48.367 --> 17:50.074
doing that as I do shuttlin' a Huey.

17:50.136 --> 17:53.015
They brought you back, recalled
you for this one mission.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.380
How do you know?

17:54.440 --> 17:56.215
My wife is General Masello's secretary.

17:56.275 --> 17:58.721
I also know your orders didn't
come from Air Force HQ.

17:58.778 --> 18:01.691
They came from Washington.
Langley, to be exact.

18:01.747 --> 18:04.819
She can lose her job
digging into things like that.

18:04.884 --> 18:06.454
I don't think so.

18:07.219 --> 18:08.630
You and Nhi Huong were too close

18:08.688 --> 18:10.929
for you to do something like that to her.

18:12.692 --> 18:14.603
You've got a check ride at 0700 hours.

18:14.660 --> 18:16.037
Be on time.

18:16.395 --> 18:18.739
I understand your IP is real tough.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.111
You'll have to move that jeep.

18:54.166 --> 18:55.804
You can't leave it there, I'm sorry.

18:55.868 --> 18:59.077
Hey, you know where I
can find a Captain Hawke?

18:59.138 --> 19:02.278
What'd he do, make a mess in the
Officers' Club, or something?

19:03.609 --> 19:05.816
He's the Army exchange pilot.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.051
Who's he up with?

19:10.116 --> 19:11.288
An instructor pilot.

19:11.350 --> 19:12.590
Does he have a name?

19:12.652 --> 19:13.892
Major Roper.

19:15.221 --> 19:16.962
High-frequency recorders?

19:17.657 --> 19:18.863
Functioning.

19:18.924 --> 19:20.403
High-speed surveillance?

19:20.459 --> 19:22.166
I can't reach it.

19:22.228 --> 19:25.141
Loosen your shoulder straps and
check the negative displacer.

19:29.235 --> 19:30.737
MiGs on our 6.

19:39.745 --> 19:42.157
Something just ain't right up there.

20:01.901 --> 20:03.505
I got both of 'em.

20:03.569 --> 20:04.980
And me.

20:38.104 --> 20:39.378
You're grounded.

20:39.438 --> 20:41.509
What are you talking about?
You can't ground me.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.053
The hell I can't.

20:43.109 --> 20:44.053
I was right!

20:44.110 --> 20:46.590
You're not here as an
exchange pilot, are you?

20:46.645 --> 20:48.386
Hawke, I have to make that ferry flight.

20:48.447 --> 20:49.448
Why?

20:49.515 --> 20:50.823
'Cause it's my job!

20:52.051 --> 20:53.792
All right, there's more.

20:54.854 --> 20:55.924
What?

20:56.522 --> 20:58.468
I can't tell you, Hawke.

20:58.824 --> 20:59.928
Then you're grounded.

20:59.992 --> 21:02.029
I'm callin' in all favors.
Whatever you figure,

21:02.094 --> 21:04.267
you owe me for old times' sake.

21:05.498 --> 21:07.944
I think you're askin' me to overpay.

21:12.805 --> 21:15.752
If you won't do it for me,
do it for Nhi Huong.

21:19.845 --> 21:22.792
I asked for a meeting, but why here?

21:22.848 --> 21:24.759
I thought you'd like my office.

21:24.817 --> 21:26.819
You assigned me.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.994
I'm sorry I don't have time to
discuss your choice of furnishings.

21:30.055 --> 21:32.899
It's not my choice. Watch your feet.

21:32.958 --> 21:35.063
What did you want to tell me?

21:36.228 --> 21:38.765
That now we both know Roper is our man.

21:38.831 --> 21:40.868
Don't tell me what I know.

21:41.066 --> 21:43.603
How about telling me something I don't know?

21:45.504 --> 21:48.815
Will you have your gladiator
sheath his sword first?

21:54.013 --> 21:55.390
Thank you.

21:56.949 --> 21:59.054
Roper is married to a Vietnamese national.

21:59.118 --> 22:00.188
Not out of the ordinary.

22:00.252 --> 22:03.631
But when you requested information
on her through your janitor,

22:03.689 --> 22:06.067
I had her checked into more thoroughly.

22:06.125 --> 22:07.729
I guess that means I talked too much.

22:07.793 --> 22:09.067
Rare, but a fact.

22:09.128 --> 22:11.972
Mrs. Roper has a child, an Amerasian son.

22:12.031 --> 22:13.840
She's been trying to get him to the States

22:13.899 --> 22:15.344
ever since you first arrived here.

22:15.401 --> 22:17.745
Mothers have been known to do that.

22:18.337 --> 22:19.873
So, I've heard.

22:21.006 --> 22:22.610
We checked and found that the boy…

22:23.876 --> 22:25.378
The kid got a name?

22:25.444 --> 22:26.684
Ho Minh.

22:26.745 --> 22:29.749
He was housed at an orphanage
till the government closed it.

22:29.815 --> 22:32.091
Then he managed to survive
in the streets for a while.

22:32.151 --> 22:34.688
The kid doesn't have half a chance.

22:35.855 --> 22:37.994
Can't you get him out of there?

22:39.491 --> 22:42.370
It seems he is now a ward of the USSR.

22:42.428 --> 22:44.669
With the cooperation of the VC government.

22:44.730 --> 22:47.768
Ho Minh has been transported
to a Russian air base

22:47.867 --> 22:49.505
at Omrylkot, Russia.

22:49.902 --> 22:51.279
So what?

22:51.937 --> 22:56.147
Omrylkot is only 180 miles from Alaska.

22:56.575 --> 22:58.612
One of the planes is scheduled to be delivered

22:58.677 --> 23:01.283
to Shemya Air Force Base in Alaska.

23:01.347 --> 23:02.553
And Roper is the pilot?

23:02.615 --> 23:03.616
Not yet.

23:03.682 --> 23:07.220
But since he's the Commander,
he makes out the duty chart.

23:07.920 --> 23:10.059
You've done quite well, Hawke.

23:10.122 --> 23:12.398
By intuition, you've managed to open the latch

23:12.458 --> 23:14.062
that opened the door for us.

23:14.126 --> 23:15.696
What about Roper?

23:16.362 --> 23:17.500
He's a traitor.

23:17.563 --> 23:18.667
Not yet, he's not.

23:18.731 --> 23:20.904
Well, the Firm is not
going to wait till he is.

23:20.966 --> 23:22.206
And the boy?

23:25.938 --> 23:28.282
A 12-year-old waif is no trade

23:28.340 --> 23:31.321
for a newly designed,
multi-million dollar plane.

23:32.711 --> 23:35.521
Depends on who does the trading, doesn't it?

23:35.581 --> 23:36.753
I do.

23:39.818 --> 23:41.798
When is Ho Minh's birthday?

23:45.824 --> 23:49.328
He's 12 years old. Don't let your
imagination run away with you.

23:52.131 --> 23:55.544
I don't want you to do anything
about Roper. Let him be.

23:55.601 --> 23:57.808
You expect me to just sit back and let him…

23:57.870 --> 24:00.783
I'll guarantee no plane will be
turned over to the Russians.

24:00.839 --> 24:02.785
You're not co-signing an auto loan.

24:02.841 --> 24:04.787
Your guarantee is not enough.

24:04.843 --> 24:06.322
It'll have to be.

24:06.512 --> 24:08.048
And if it's not?

24:13.352 --> 24:15.764
I'll trade Airwolf for the boy.

25:02.368 --> 25:04.006
What do you want?

25:13.946 --> 25:15.755
You knew that was comin'.

25:15.814 --> 25:17.384
I know I deserved it, too.

25:17.449 --> 25:18.757
Get up.

25:22.554 --> 25:24.329
What was that one for, interest?

25:24.390 --> 25:26.700
That was instead of a firin' squad.

25:28.794 --> 25:31.707
They don't shoot you for makin' a
fool of yourself on a check ride.

25:31.764 --> 25:34.768
They do for turnin' aircraft
over to the Russians.

25:36.001 --> 25:37.878
I don't know what you're talking about.

25:37.936 --> 25:39.916
You'd better start rememberin'.

25:40.472 --> 25:44.079
Because I'm the only thing standing
between you and a blindfold.

28:01.980 --> 28:04.893
Hey, mister, could you tell me something?

28:06.251 --> 28:08.060
Are you hungry again?

28:08.253 --> 28:10.164
Yeah, that, too.

28:10.556 --> 28:14.094
But it's about this picture.

28:16.195 --> 28:18.175
Yeah. What about it?

28:18.497 --> 28:22.104
Could you tell me which one is my Father?

28:25.470 --> 28:27.643
Which one would you like it to be?

28:27.773 --> 28:30.185
Any one of them is okay.

28:35.180 --> 28:38.024
Damn it, Sam. You're too smart to
think you could get away with this.

28:38.083 --> 28:40.586
I'm not a traitor. Before I'd
turn that plane over to anybody,

28:40.652 --> 28:42.393
I'd ditch with it in the Bering Sea.

28:42.454 --> 28:44.263
Yeah, and freeze to death in 11 minutes.

28:44.323 --> 28:46.064
It'd be worth the gamble.

28:46.858 --> 28:48.360
You've never been an idiot before.

28:48.427 --> 28:50.600
I've never been a Father before either.

28:51.563 --> 28:53.167
I have a son, Hawke.

28:53.298 --> 28:55.175
A son I've never seen before.

28:55.234 --> 28:57.271
A son who doesn't even know who I am.

29:00.172 --> 29:01.947
Why didn't he come out with Nhi Huong?

29:02.040 --> 29:03.576
They were separated.

29:03.642 --> 29:05.553
He was in the Swiss Hospital there.

29:05.611 --> 29:08.114
He was due to come on the next
flight, but he never made it.

29:08.180 --> 29:09.352
Nhi wanted to stay.

29:09.414 --> 29:11.860
I convinced her he'd be all
right. That was the only way.

29:11.917 --> 29:13.453
How did the Russians contact you?

29:13.518 --> 29:15.395
Hanoi contacted Nhi first.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.927
They strung us out for over a year,

29:17.990 --> 29:20.300
finally turned us over to a Russian.

29:24.396 --> 29:26.342
You really think you can pull this off?

29:26.398 --> 29:28.105
I figured I'd make a navigational error

29:28.166 --> 29:29.907
and be forced down in their territory.

29:29.968 --> 29:31.845
In time, I'd be exchanged.

29:31.903 --> 29:34.213
You said you'd ditch the plane
before you'd turn it over.

29:34.273 --> 29:36.514
That's exactly what I was
going to do. Call an emergency

29:36.575 --> 29:38.680
and ditch before I get to the island.

29:38.744 --> 29:41.054
I figured they'd give me
my boy just for tryin'.

29:41.113 --> 29:42.717
You really believe that?

29:42.781 --> 29:44.556
It will work.

29:44.616 --> 29:46.926
If you'd just stay out of it, Hawke.

29:49.888 --> 29:51.993
I can't stay out of it.

29:52.057 --> 29:54.503
What would you do if it was your son?

29:56.395 --> 29:58.102
You owe it to Sam.

29:58.163 --> 30:01.042
He saved your life when it
still meant something to you.

30:01.099 --> 30:02.669
I never told you that.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.382
What about it, Hawke?

30:12.944 --> 30:14.355
Pay Sam back.

30:16.748 --> 30:19.490
A man has a right to see his son.

30:27.359 --> 30:29.839
No! Not a chance!

30:29.895 --> 30:31.238
Just hold on, Dom.

30:31.296 --> 30:34.038
I can't have an excitable man
making precision adjustments on it.

30:34.099 --> 30:37.046
You see what I mean? You're
not even thinking straight.

30:37.135 --> 30:39.547
Look, you can't say a thing
about it on the phone.

30:39.604 --> 30:41.379
Archangel probably has it tapped.

30:41.440 --> 30:44.853
That only saves me from havin' to
make a direct call to Michael.

30:45.110 --> 30:46.612
Just don't you pick up a tail.

30:46.945 --> 30:50.085
Me? Nobody tails me.

30:50.182 --> 30:52.685
Then I can trust you to handle everything.

30:52.751 --> 30:55.664
Doesn't my saying no mean anything to you?

30:56.121 --> 30:59.193
Only when you mean it. See you later.

31:05.330 --> 31:06.536
Michael,

31:06.598 --> 31:10.045
you'll find that if you add
some pine-scented detergent

31:10.102 --> 31:11.740
to your scrub water,

31:11.803 --> 31:15.808
you'll give your bathrooms
that fresh outdoor aroma.

31:19.211 --> 31:21.316
All, right, we're takin' off in 3 sections.

31:21.380 --> 31:23.656
Winner and Jones to Corpus Christi,

31:23.715 --> 31:25.456
Simms and Lewis to Orlando,

31:25.517 --> 31:27.326
and I'm taking the Alaska run with Hawke.

31:27.386 --> 31:30.026
These flight plans and re-fueling points

31:30.088 --> 31:31.761
read like a crossword puzzle, Sam.

31:31.823 --> 31:34.269
That's exactly how they’ll read
to foreign satellite radar.

31:34.326 --> 31:36.863
I want to use low-level
flying whenever possible.

31:36.928 --> 31:38.236
Desert and water.

31:38.296 --> 31:39.969
Let's make this as difficult as we can.

31:40.031 --> 31:42.375
For who? I didn't think
this was still a secret.

31:42.434 --> 31:45.005
Maybe not, we're not advertisin' either.

31:46.304 --> 31:47.908
Any further questions?

31:48.673 --> 31:50.914
All right then, good luck to you all.

31:52.043 --> 31:54.614
Hawke, I'd like to see you for a second.

31:57.983 --> 32:00.554
Everything going the way you want it so far?

32:01.052 --> 32:04.192
Well, the flight plan ought
to put enough gaps in radar

32:04.256 --> 32:05.496
to keep Air Defense busy.

32:05.557 --> 32:08.163
Unless we messed them up too much
and they call the flight back.

32:08.226 --> 32:10.365
Once you take off, there's no turnin' back.

32:10.429 --> 32:13.899
You just go deaf and dumb and
you do just what I tell you.

32:13.965 --> 32:17.174
Thank you. You want to tell me
now how you're going to do it?

32:17.536 --> 32:19.106
With a helicopter.

32:25.510 --> 32:27.421
Eagle flight, you're cleared for take off.

32:27.746 --> 32:29.692
Eagle flight rolling.

32:57.609 --> 33:00.146
We've just passed the point of no return.

33:00.312 --> 33:01.382
Roger.

33:46.291 --> 33:48.328
Sir, I've lost contact with Eagle 3.

33:48.393 --> 33:49.565
Give him a call.

33:49.628 --> 33:51.369
It could be atmospheric.

34:02.073 --> 34:03.177
You're a janitor.

34:03.241 --> 34:04.686
You see how clean that desert is?

34:05.810 --> 34:08.984
You'll get a radio signal
when it's time to take off.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.856
Resume your present flight plan.

34:10.916 --> 34:12.987
How am I gonna explain you're not with me?

34:13.051 --> 34:14.688
You won't have to.

34:30.601 --> 34:32.741
Sure is cold out here.

34:32.804 --> 34:35.580
Cold? You call this cold?

34:36.074 --> 34:37.643
I remember the time your Dad and me

34:37.708 --> 34:40.280
were ferrying planes from Thule to England.

34:40.344 --> 34:42.382
We had to stop over in Iceland.

34:42.447 --> 34:45.188
It got so cold on that one flight

34:45.250 --> 34:47.696
that the engines froze right
in the middle of the air

34:47.752 --> 34:49.594
and we couldn't come down.

35:14.646 --> 35:18.116
That ought to warm you up.

36:21.446 --> 36:23.926
2,000… 4,000…

36:25.483 --> 36:28.828
8,000… 12,000…

36:31.623 --> 36:32.658
There he is.

36:32.724 --> 36:33.998
Eagle 3, Base.

36:34.059 --> 36:35.834
Eagle 3 to Base.

36:35.894 --> 36:37.737
3, we've have been unable to read you

36:37.796 --> 36:39.332
for the past 20 minutes. Over.

36:39.397 --> 36:42.207
Sorry, Base. I had a
pressurization leak indicated,

36:42.267 --> 36:44.679
I dropped to below Angel's 10 to check it out.

36:44.736 --> 36:46.579
3 are you declaring an emergency?

36:46.671 --> 36:48.241
Negative. Negative.

36:48.306 --> 36:51.116
It's a malfunctioning light.
I'm climbing back to Angel's 30.

36:51.176 --> 36:53.884
Roger, Eagle 3. Cleared 300.

36:54.012 --> 36:56.652
Keep an eye on him, if he drops
off again, I want to know.

36:56.715 --> 36:57.750
Yes, sir.

36:59.417 --> 37:01.055
We got away with it so far.

37:01.119 --> 37:02.257
Sure.

37:02.320 --> 37:05.358
Now all we have to do
is attack Russia, steal a kid,

37:05.423 --> 37:07.699
and try not to get caught
by our own government.

37:07.759 --> 37:09.830
In the meantime, I still don't know

37:09.894 --> 37:12.340
what all these knobs and…
and… and buttons are for.

37:12.397 --> 37:14.035
I wouldn't sweat it, Dom.

37:14.099 --> 37:17.137
If you touch that eject button,
you'll be the first to know.

37:27.712 --> 37:29.157
Hey, what's that?

37:29.280 --> 37:31.055
Put on the descrambler.

37:31.116 --> 37:32.823
Oh, sure.

37:35.453 --> 37:36.989
That's not the one.

37:37.989 --> 37:39.366
Okay, which one is it?

37:39.424 --> 37:40.596
Upper left.

37:40.925 --> 37:43.735
Right next to the Shrike missile. Be careful.

37:46.531 --> 37:49.102
Good afternoon, Stringfellow.

37:49.467 --> 37:52.573
I don't suppose you'd consider
giving me your coordinates?

37:52.637 --> 37:54.514
Dom's the navigator here.

37:54.572 --> 37:57.553
Oh, good. Then at least the cockpit
has been freshly scrubbed.

37:57.809 --> 37:59.811
How long did it take you to figure out

37:59.878 --> 38:01.118
what I was going to do?

38:01.179 --> 38:04.058
When you disappeared on the radar screen.

38:04.249 --> 38:07.696
Hawke, I'd like to see you bring the boy back.

38:07.752 --> 38:09.356
But we've got to keep the plane.

38:09.420 --> 38:10.592
Amazing!

38:10.655 --> 38:14.364
Behind that impeccable
white suit beats a heart

38:14.425 --> 38:16.632
of recyclable plastic.

38:16.694 --> 38:18.139
That's very good, Dominic.

38:18.196 --> 38:21.370
Hawke, please give him a sugar
cube and a pat on the neck for me.

38:21.432 --> 38:23.810
I may not be accurate about your location,

38:23.868 --> 38:25.643
but I can sure make an educated guess

38:25.703 --> 38:28.513
as to your destination. Can I assist?

38:29.040 --> 38:30.781
Yeah, you can feed my dog.

38:33.077 --> 38:34.852
How did you know I was…

38:36.447 --> 38:39.087
Sometimes, Hawke, you amaze even me.

38:39.150 --> 38:40.322
Good luck.

38:42.787 --> 38:44.596
How come Archangel's "good luck"

38:44.656 --> 38:45.999
always sounds like "goodbye?"

38:46.057 --> 38:47.764
Turn on the radar scanner.

38:48.193 --> 38:51.697
Do I guess, or will you give me a hint?

38:51.763 --> 38:54.676
It's the green light next
to the chain gun power.

38:56.267 --> 38:59.840
Says here we're 2.5 miles from Nome, Alaska.

38:59.904 --> 39:01.008
Whatever happened to that

39:01.072 --> 39:02.847
"flying by the seat of your pants" stuff?

39:02.907 --> 39:04.580
It went out when designers started

39:04.642 --> 39:06.519
to write their names on your behind.

39:06.578 --> 39:08.057
Ferry 3 to Control.

39:08.479 --> 39:09.651
Eagle 3, Go.

39:09.714 --> 39:13.161
Ferry 3, I'll be dropping
altitude and altering directions.

39:13.218 --> 39:15.061
This is not an emergency.

39:15.420 --> 39:17.832
I repeat, this is not an emergency.

39:17.889 --> 39:20.665
Negative Eagle 3! Maintain your
present heading and altitude.

39:20.725 --> 39:23.501
You are not authorized to deviate
from the flight plan, over.

39:23.561 --> 39:25.404
Strap her down, Dom.

39:49.320 --> 39:52.324
Why not let those people
mow their own lawns?

39:52.690 --> 39:54.636
Increasing speed.

40:03.268 --> 40:05.475
I can't think of any way to help him.

40:05.870 --> 40:07.747
Short of an invasion of Russia,

40:07.805 --> 40:10.479
all we can do is be restrained spectators.

40:12.710 --> 40:14.951
Too bad. He's a very capable man.

40:15.013 --> 40:16.651
Hawke or Dominic?

40:17.615 --> 40:19.595
I never met Dominic Santini.

40:20.385 --> 40:23.491
Well, he's not nearly as
attractive as Stringfellow.

40:24.656 --> 40:27.000
Well, I hope both of them make it.

40:27.592 --> 40:29.697
For professional reasons, I'm sure.

40:30.461 --> 40:31.804
Of course.

41:17.475 --> 41:20.888
String, it's time for some
serious thoughts on religion.

41:21.245 --> 41:23.020
We just crossed our protective zone.

41:23.081 --> 41:24.856
We're approaching foreign territory.

41:24.916 --> 41:26.293
I'm slowing.

41:27.685 --> 41:30.029
I'm going to match Ferry 3's air speed.

41:40.431 --> 41:42.468
Hey, you invite anyone else on this trip?

41:42.533 --> 41:43.511
How many?

41:49.073 --> 41:52.282
The readout says MiG-23, 20 miles away.

41:52.977 --> 41:55.184
Now will you act a little worried?

42:03.955 --> 42:07.129
Check the ground scanner and
see what's at the airstrip.

42:08.559 --> 42:12.200
3 low buildings, some equipment,
and a radar trailer.

42:12.263 --> 42:14.265
Which one shows the most heat on the scanner?

42:14.332 --> 42:17.040
The one on the west end is
giving off the hottest signals.

42:17.101 --> 42:18.307
That's where Ho Minh will be.

42:18.369 --> 42:19.939
I'll blind them, you make them deaf

42:20.004 --> 42:21.813
You're forgetting the MiGs.

42:21.906 --> 42:24.011
We'll send 'em a decoy missile to chase.

42:24.075 --> 42:25.053
You ready?

42:25.109 --> 42:26.782
Will you take no for an answer?

42:26.844 --> 42:27.879
Sure.

42:40.425 --> 42:42.427
They're deaf but they're not blind.

42:42.493 --> 42:43.972
We're coming in like a jet.

42:44.028 --> 42:45.132
You know the procedure.

42:45.196 --> 42:46.675
I know we never did it right once!

42:46.731 --> 42:48.540
There's always a first time.

42:50.234 --> 42:52.043
Targeting countdown.

42:52.103 --> 42:55.209
Yeah, yeah, all right, I'm ready.
You've got all the firepower.

42:55.273 --> 42:57.082
Be ready to cut turbos.

44:14.685 --> 44:16.323
Come on, kid. We're headin' back

44:16.387 --> 44:18.833
for the land of hamburgers and heartburn.

45:47.144 --> 45:48.987
Are you my Father?

45:56.120 --> 45:58.430
You'll know him when you see him.

46:14.038 --> 46:15.244
Get the ball now, boy.

46:15.306 --> 46:17.343
You're going to receive a reprimand

46:17.408 --> 46:18.443
on your service record

46:18.509 --> 46:20.648
for not arriving in Alaska with Roper.

46:20.711 --> 46:22.554
Does that mean I'm not gonna make General?

46:22.613 --> 46:24.251
I certainly hope so.

46:24.348 --> 46:27.420
Have you considered a
career in airplane theft?

46:28.119 --> 46:30.565
I still haven't quite
figured out how you managed

46:30.621 --> 46:34.034
to keep switching planes and still
keep our radar in the dark.

46:36.794 --> 46:39.240
You have to ask Dominic about that.

46:39.297 --> 46:40.605
Dominic's not talking to me.

46:40.665 --> 46:42.736
I'd like to keep it that way.

46:46.170 --> 46:49.947
Well, if you'll excuse me, I think
I'll just go stare at the lake.

46:54.812 --> 46:58.259
Looking at them, I know it was all worth it.

47:02.253 --> 47:05.427
Maybe it's about time for
some truth about Ho Minh?

47:07.191 --> 47:10.434
Ho Minh's last name is Roper.

47:12.063 --> 47:13.542
It always has been.

47:17.968 --> 47:20.414
I guess I gotta live with that answer.

47:22.473 --> 47:24.714
It's the only answer I'll ever give.

47:27.445 --> 47:28.890
Fair enough.

47:31.716 --> 47:34.663
But if your son ever needs me, I'll be there.

47:36.821 --> 47:38.198
You'll have to be.

47:38.656 --> 47:40.897
We're giving him an American name.

47:41.392 --> 47:42.564
What's that?

47:42.960 --> 47:44.166
Guess?

47:51.836 --> 47:54.612
Stringfellow's no name for a kid like that.
