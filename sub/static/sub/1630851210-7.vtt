[ethereal music playing]

00:11.960 --> 00:13.520
[Lily] After eating her mother,

00:13.600 --> 00:17.400
Glenoxi found herself
exiled from Oblivion 6

00:17.480 --> 00:19.840
and left to wander the desolate crevices

00:19.920 --> 00:21.960
of the planet Zorg on her own.

00:26.240 --> 00:28.800
-With no food and no water…
-[Glenoxi groans]

00:28.880 --> 00:31.360
…Glenoxi was feeling
her lifeblood drain away.

00:31.440 --> 00:32.680
[Glenoxi groans]

00:32.760 --> 00:35.120
She made her peace with dying like this.

00:35.720 --> 00:38.240
As a creature
that never felt she belonged,

00:38.320 --> 00:41.240
facing the end on her own
seemed only fitting.

00:42.280 --> 00:44.200
[electronic music playing]

00:44.800 --> 00:49.360
But then Glenoxi saw Starlanza
for the first time.

00:55.080 --> 01:00.120
As the water hit her lips,
Glenoxi knew that this was her soulmate.

01:00.200 --> 01:02.280
The only creature in the whole universe

01:02.360 --> 01:05.240
who would understand
and accept her completely.

01:05.760 --> 01:09.120
And she was overwhelmed
that Starlanza felt the same.

01:22.840 --> 01:25.720
[video game music playing]

01:29.360 --> 01:30.560
Lily Pad,

01:31.280 --> 01:33.200
you should get ready for school.

01:33.720 --> 01:34.880
I'm not going.

01:35.400 --> 01:37.400
[coughs] Still feel sick.

01:38.320 --> 01:40.000
Well, it's been three days.

01:42.960 --> 01:45.200
Ola's called on the house phone again.

01:45.760 --> 01:47.360
Have you two had a fight?

01:48.800 --> 01:50.160
No, we're fine.

01:50.960 --> 01:52.680
[inhales] Well,

01:53.680 --> 01:55.160
I've got to go to work now.

01:56.200 --> 01:58.360
Hopefully, you'll feel better tomorrow.

02:04.720 --> 02:06.160
[Hugh, straining] 193.

02:06.240 --> 02:08.640
194, 195,

02:08.720 --> 02:09.960

02:10.040 --> 02:12.600
197, 198,

02:12.680 --> 02:14.960
199, 200.

02:15.040 --> 02:16.200
Yeah!

02:16.280 --> 02:18.000
[panting]

02:19.440 --> 02:20.280
[exclaims]

02:20.360 --> 02:22.920
Can you change this bulb for me?

02:23.000 --> 02:24.800
[pants] Sure.

02:26.040 --> 02:28.120
[Hugh breathing heavily]

02:31.280 --> 02:32.360
Thank you.

02:35.200 --> 02:36.240
[grunts]

02:38.680 --> 02:39.560
Ah.

02:40.120 --> 02:41.120
There you go.

02:43.160 --> 02:44.440
Bit sweaty. [chuckles]

02:45.120 --> 02:46.000
Sorry.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.440
I'll jump in the shower.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.320
[radio] Thanks for that report
from our traffic correspondent.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.560
And all eyes
are on Moordale Secondary today

02:56.640 --> 02:58.200
as they hold their first open day

02:58.280 --> 03:00.680
since the "Sex School" controversy
of last term.

03:00.760 --> 03:04.040
Hope Haddon has said she aims
to clean up Moordale's dirty name--

[knocking at door]

03:19.920 --> 03:20.920
Yeah?

03:24.040 --> 03:25.640
Gotta get my jacket.

03:27.280 --> 03:30.080
We have our session
with Dr. Cutton later today.

03:32.800 --> 03:33.760
I'll think about it.

03:34.880 --> 03:36.760
Good luck with your TV interview.

03:38.480 --> 03:40.480
[music continues]

03:44.480 --> 03:45.520
Oh f…

03:45.600 --> 03:46.640
[exhales]

03:48.160 --> 03:49.120
Hey.

03:49.840 --> 03:50.840
Hey.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.480
I'm worried about Lily.

03:54.560 --> 03:58.040
She hasn't spoken to me
since everything that happened with Hope.

03:58.840 --> 04:02.480
-Could you go talk to her, please?
-I'm not a therapist, Ola.

04:02.560 --> 04:07.240
I know, but she told me about how much
you helped her with the vaginismus stuff.

04:07.320 --> 04:08.840
I think she really trusts you.

04:08.920 --> 04:11.000
I'm not the right person to ask. Sorry.

04:11.520 --> 04:14.320
Could you please do up my buckle, Otis?

04:18.480 --> 04:19.480
Really?

04:20.080 --> 04:22.800
I thought we'd grown out
of the silent treatment phase.

04:24.920 --> 04:25.760
[Jean] Look,

04:26.800 --> 04:31.560
I know that you're both aware
that Jakob and I are having some issues,

04:31.640 --> 04:34.760
but I want you to still feel
that this is your family home

04:34.840 --> 04:38.640
and a safe space
for you to talk about your feelings.

04:38.720 --> 04:40.880
Why is my dad
not part of this conversation?

04:40.960 --> 04:45.080
Your dad feels it's better not to talk
about these things with you guys.

04:45.160 --> 04:48.320
So you can't even agree on
how to tell us you might be splitting up?

04:48.400 --> 04:52.280
Lots of couples have differing opinions
on how to parent children.

04:52.360 --> 04:55.960
Maybe you should have thought about that
before you decided to have a baby

04:56.040 --> 04:58.920
and make us
all pretend to be a bizarre family!

04:59.880 --> 05:01.080
I'm going to school!

05:06.160 --> 05:07.720
-[door opens]
-I'm sorry.

05:07.800 --> 05:10.240
-It's all a bit of a mess.
-[door closes]

05:12.440 --> 05:13.720
[Jean exhales]

05:19.880 --> 05:23.480
[sighs] Everything you do
seems to turn into a mess, Mum.

05:29.560 --> 05:32.240
[door opens, closes]

05:34.880 --> 05:37.400
Through! And over! Over!

05:37.960 --> 05:41.200
Up! Yes! Well done! Yes!

05:41.280 --> 05:42.400
[dog barks]

05:42.480 --> 05:44.840
-Yeah! Good girl. Oh!
-[dog barks]

05:44.920 --> 05:46.320
Didn't know she could do that.

05:47.200 --> 05:49.760
Don't forget, it's your uncle Peter's
dinner party this evening.

05:49.840 --> 05:51.760
Oh, no. I'm not going.
Uncle Peter's a dick.

05:51.840 --> 05:53.640
-Adam!
-I'm just saying.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.880
You're not with Dad anymore.
I don't know why you're going.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.520
Okay. Yeah, you're right.

06:00.160 --> 06:02.800
Peter is a bit of a dick.

06:03.480 --> 06:05.840
But I'm just trying
to ease the adjustment process.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.800
[doorbell rings]

06:10.320 --> 06:12.560
-Is your friend Eric back?
-Yep. Okay.

06:12.640 --> 06:13.680
-Bye.
-Bye.

06:17.320 --> 06:18.160
Hey.

06:19.200 --> 06:20.080
[Eric] Hey!

06:22.280 --> 06:23.600
-How are you?
-Yeah, good.

06:23.680 --> 06:24.680
Yeah?

06:25.640 --> 06:26.920
Ooh! My mum.

06:27.000 --> 06:27.880
Mm-hmm.

06:30.960 --> 06:32.240
Okay, let's go.

06:33.800 --> 06:35.000
Hello, Maureen.

06:35.080 --> 06:37.120
[laughing]

06:37.200 --> 06:38.120
Okay.

06:39.720 --> 06:41.680
[pensive music playing]

06:47.480 --> 06:48.480
I missed you.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.440
-I missed you too.
-Yeah?

06:51.520 --> 06:52.680
Yeah.

06:53.960 --> 06:54.800
Come.

06:55.840 --> 06:56.840
Let's go.

07:18.040 --> 07:18.880
Hello?

07:18.960 --> 07:19.960
[Erin] Yeah. Hey.

07:20.960 --> 07:22.440
-Mum?
-Um…

07:23.320 --> 07:24.320
Where are you?

07:25.920 --> 07:28.080
-Mum, you need to bring Elsie ba--
-[dial tone]

07:30.040 --> 07:31.520
Have they found Elsie yet?

07:32.880 --> 07:33.760
No.

07:34.560 --> 07:36.240
I think I know where my mum is though.

07:36.920 --> 07:38.320
[sighs]

07:38.400 --> 07:41.200
So you haven't been replying to my texts.

07:41.840 --> 07:44.240
Yeah, well,
I am quite annoyed at you right now.

07:45.960 --> 07:48.040
Fair enough. I would be too.

07:48.120 --> 07:51.360
Listen, we don't have to talk about this
when you've got stuff to worry about.

07:51.440 --> 07:52.440
Okay, fine.

07:53.240 --> 07:56.600
But I just want you to know
that I'm confused about all of this.

07:58.960 --> 08:00.560
What am I supposed to say to that, Maeve?

08:01.240 --> 08:03.960
If you're not sure you wanna be with me,
then it's probably not right.

08:08.440 --> 08:09.600
-Isaac.
-Look.

08:10.360 --> 08:12.440
I need to be with someone
who's sure about me

08:13.120 --> 08:14.480
because I think I deserve that.

08:14.560 --> 08:17.520
And even if you and I
were able to work this out,

08:17.600 --> 08:20.960
I would still be worried
that you'd regret not trying with Otis,

08:21.040 --> 08:22.360
and I can't do that.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.240
So with respect,

08:26.000 --> 08:27.480
I'm taking my heart off the table.

08:29.120 --> 08:30.320
Good luck finding your mum.

-You both still wanna do this?
-Absolutely.

08:52.160 --> 08:53.600
-Yep.
-Yes!

08:53.680 --> 08:54.600
Incoming.

08:57.360 --> 08:58.960
Happy Open Day!

08:59.520 --> 09:00.720
Are you prepped?

09:01.320 --> 09:03.080
I'm really looking forward to it.

09:03.960 --> 09:04.920
That's good.

09:06.560 --> 09:09.080
-Eric! You're back! Yes!
-Hey! [laughs]

09:09.160 --> 09:11.760
I missed you!
How was Nigeria? Tell me everything!

09:11.840 --> 09:15.840
Oh, it was good. The wedding was great,
and my family was the best!

09:17.960 --> 09:19.720
What are you doing?

09:19.800 --> 09:22.920
I've run out of clean pants,
and I'm chafing real bad.

09:23.000 --> 09:23.960
[Otis sighs]

09:25.880 --> 09:28.360
-What is that?
-It's my shame sign.

09:29.120 --> 09:31.280
I threw a poo
out the coach window in France.

09:31.360 --> 09:33.880
Except it wasn't me. It was Rahim.

09:34.680 --> 09:35.960
We're kinda friends now.

09:36.560 --> 09:38.400
-You're friends with Rahim?
-Kind of.

09:38.920 --> 09:41.280
Whoa, whoa, wow. Wow! Wow!

09:41.360 --> 09:43.720
What? It's itchy.
You know how big my balls are.

09:43.800 --> 09:46.400
Okay, fine. But we are in public.

09:46.480 --> 09:48.480
Go to the bathroom and sort yourself out.

09:49.600 --> 09:51.000
-Fine.
-Fine.

09:51.080 --> 09:53.440
You need to tell him about the thing.

09:54.160 --> 09:55.160
What thing?

09:55.800 --> 09:58.280
-Hey! Sorry. Hi. Have you seen Aimee?
-Oh!

09:58.360 --> 10:01.120
-Hi. No. Maeve?
-Okay. Yeah?

10:01.200 --> 10:04.880
I was gonna text you to apologize,
but that felt pathetic. Can we maybe talk?

10:04.960 --> 10:07.400
I don't really have time right now.
I think I found my mum, so…

10:08.400 --> 10:11.120
-Do you need any help?
-It's okay. I'll let you know how it goes.

10:11.200 --> 10:13.200
[mischievous music playing]

10:17.560 --> 10:19.000
What are we apologizing for?

10:21.200 --> 10:22.160
Okay, okay.

10:22.240 --> 10:24.080
So, in France,

10:24.160 --> 10:26.080
and please don't freak out, but…

10:27.320 --> 10:28.680
Maeve and I kissed.

10:33.960 --> 10:34.960
You okay?

10:36.840 --> 10:39.880
I'm actually speechless.

10:41.080 --> 10:44.480
What kind of kiss?
A peck-on-the-cheek kiss or a kiss-kiss?

10:44.560 --> 10:46.600
[splutters] Um, it was a kiss-kiss.

10:46.680 --> 10:49.480
What happened after this kiss-kiss?
Are you guys a couple now?

10:49.560 --> 10:52.280
No. I messed it all up again.

10:52.880 --> 10:56.320
She thinks I don't care about anything
now I don't do the clinic.

10:56.840 --> 10:58.240
You think that's true?

10:58.320 --> 10:59.680
You don't do the clinic anymore

10:59.760 --> 11:02.920
because you had your heart broken,
and you couldn't be around Maeve.

11:03.480 --> 11:06.560
I don't think you stopped caring.
I think you had to protect yourself.

11:08.240 --> 11:12.720
Please, tell me this was at least
the best kiss of your entire life!

11:12.800 --> 11:15.160
-It was pretty amazing.
-Aha! I'm so proud of you!

11:15.240 --> 11:17.920
Otis! Can you help me out
with something for the thing?

11:18.000 --> 11:20.280
Our computer guy has dropped out,
so we need a replacement.

11:20.360 --> 11:23.480
I thought of you 'cause you seem nerdy.

11:23.560 --> 11:24.720
-Yes.
-Mm-hmm.

11:24.800 --> 11:25.640
-So, yeah.
-Okay.

11:25.720 --> 11:28.200
Well, I was kinda hoping
to stay out of this one.

11:28.280 --> 11:31.920
Um, what?
Of course you'll help. I'll help too.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.120
Thank you.
Hey, be more Eric, okay? Thank you.

11:36.200 --> 11:38.000
I agree with that, actually.

11:39.160 --> 11:40.240
What's the thing?

11:40.840 --> 11:42.840
[mischievous music playing]

11:46.760 --> 11:49.760
-Thought you were shutting down the stall.
-It's for the thing!

11:49.840 --> 11:50.840
[Steve] They look great.

11:50.920 --> 11:53.680
-Aimee, have you got a sec?
-Thought we weren't talking.

11:55.080 --> 11:56.240
I've been an absolute arse.

11:57.360 --> 11:59.520
Me too. Steve, hold the cakes.

12:02.880 --> 12:03.920
[Aimee sighs]

12:04.000 --> 12:05.560
[Maeve] I'm so sorry. You're right.

12:05.640 --> 12:07.800
I'm shit at asking for help,
and I push people away.

12:07.880 --> 12:10.720
No. I should never have done
what I did without asking first.

12:10.800 --> 12:12.960
I didn't realize how hurtful it would be.

12:13.040 --> 12:15.560
Thing is, I need help now,
and you're the only person I can trust.

12:15.640 --> 12:17.320
Okay. What we doing?

12:17.920 --> 12:19.360
Can you drive me to Lockwood-on-Sea?

12:21.160 --> 12:24.000
Right. Steve, you're in charge
of vulvas from now on.

12:24.080 --> 12:27.000
If anyone asks, the wobbly bits
aren't mistakes because…

12:27.080 --> 12:28.920
All vulvas are unique.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Good lad.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.120
They better not be squished.

12:43.560 --> 12:45.560
It's only been a few months.

12:46.200 --> 12:48.640
I shouldn't be
so irritated by him, should I?

12:48.720 --> 12:49.920
Are there any positives?

12:50.720 --> 12:52.160
We have lots of sex.

12:52.240 --> 12:54.240
Ooh. [chuckles]

12:54.760 --> 12:57.600
Well, a healthy sex life is important
for many people.

12:58.200 --> 12:59.320
I know it won't last though.

12:59.400 --> 13:03.120
There was a time that Michael and I
couldn't keep our hands off each other.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.040
And then

13:05.680 --> 13:07.200
it just stopped.

13:07.280 --> 13:09.480
Well, that doesn't have to be inevitable.

13:10.400 --> 13:14.040
Oh, I've been meaning to tell you
that Michael stopped by the other day.

13:14.120 --> 13:17.720
He was returning something that
belonged to me. We ended up having a chat.

13:17.800 --> 13:18.640
About what?

13:18.720 --> 13:23.360
I think he's struggling a bit
and just needed someone to talk to.

13:23.880 --> 13:24.800
[scoffs]

13:25.320 --> 13:26.760
That's a bit rich.

13:29.120 --> 13:30.920
Sorry. [sighs]

13:31.000 --> 13:33.600
It's just… Why wouldn't he talk
to me all those years?

13:33.680 --> 13:36.680
And Adam's exactly the same. [sighs]

13:36.760 --> 13:42.600
It's just so lonely sometimes
with all these men.

13:42.680 --> 13:44.880
[Jean] Well, Adam will talk to you
when he's ready.

13:44.960 --> 13:48.200
You know, I'm not very good
at letting Otis come to me.

13:48.280 --> 13:50.200
I admire your restraint.

13:52.680 --> 13:54.320
-Twenty minutes.
-Thank you.

13:55.440 --> 13:56.920
Oh, that looks nice.

14:00.520 --> 14:02.840
We are making way for a brighter,

14:03.720 --> 14:04.880
cleaner future

14:04.960 --> 14:07.200
here at Sparkside Academy.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.640
You can fucking do this.

14:14.480 --> 14:16.320
[woman] The press are arriving.

14:16.400 --> 14:17.880
It's Superman pose.

14:17.960 --> 14:20.120
It helps with nerves.
There's a TED Talk on it.

14:20.200 --> 14:22.680
-[scoffs]
-[clears throat, sniffles]

14:22.760 --> 14:24.920
[whimsical music continues]

14:25.000 --> 14:25.880
Right.

14:29.440 --> 14:31.480
Making way for a brighter,

14:32.240 --> 14:33.680
cleaner future

14:34.760 --> 14:36.960
at Sparkside fucking Academy.

14:37.520 --> 14:38.360
Fuck.

14:38.880 --> 14:39.840
Yes.

14:44.560 --> 14:47.120
-Why are you wearing that?
-You told me to.

14:47.200 --> 14:49.440
Okay, take it off now.

14:49.520 --> 14:50.440
Yeah.

14:53.520 --> 14:56.640
-Hope! It's a good turnout.
-Yes!

14:56.720 --> 15:00.880
Lots of prospective students,
the press, and all our private investors,

15:00.960 --> 15:03.280
so, uh, no pressure at all. [chuckles]

15:03.360 --> 15:06.440
Right. Well, I'll be interested
to hear your feedback.

15:06.520 --> 15:09.160
Would you, um, just excuse me a second?

15:09.240 --> 15:10.280
Mm. Yeah.

15:19.000 --> 15:19.840
Cal?

15:21.080 --> 15:22.160
Come with me.

15:27.960 --> 15:29.320
[Cal] Get your hands off me!

15:29.920 --> 15:33.120
You have been told repeatedly
to change your behavior,

15:33.200 --> 15:35.720
but you are clearly innately disobedient.

15:35.800 --> 15:36.800
[scoffs]

15:37.760 --> 15:39.920
The press would be interested
to hear about

15:40.000 --> 15:42.120
the way I've been discriminated against

15:42.200 --> 15:43.720
due to how I present.

15:46.840 --> 15:51.080
I'm left with no choice but to keep you
in here for the remainder of Open Day.

15:51.160 --> 15:54.400
-You're in violation of my rights.
-[door rattling]

15:55.160 --> 15:56.160
Let me go!

15:56.240 --> 15:58.960
-[indistinct chattering]
-[camera shutters clicking]

16:01.280 --> 16:03.520
Well, this… this is different.

16:05.480 --> 16:06.440
[Colin] Oh.

16:19.880 --> 16:22.960
[Jackson] So, yeah,
all pretty self-explanatory.

16:23.040 --> 16:23.920
-Mm-hmm.
-Um…

16:24.000 --> 16:25.480
-Stop.
-Okay.

16:25.560 --> 16:27.200
-Start.
-Okay.

16:27.280 --> 16:28.280
-Dimmer.
-Mm-hmm.

16:28.360 --> 16:30.840
-And do not press these red--
-This one?

16:30.920 --> 16:32.480
-[Jackson] Yeah. Don't press that.
-Okay.

16:33.600 --> 16:34.960
-I'll keep him--
-[Eric] Okay.

16:35.040 --> 16:36.320
-[Jackson] Yeah?
-[Eric] Yeah.

16:36.400 --> 16:39.760
I mean, I was imagining something
more center stage, but this is cool.

16:39.840 --> 16:41.760
It's like we're in Ocean's Eleven, innit?

16:41.840 --> 16:44.000
Maybe I'm George Clooney,
and you're Brad Pitt?

16:44.080 --> 16:45.720
-No.
-I'm Brad Pitt. You're George Clooney.

16:45.800 --> 16:47.880
-I'm Andy García. If I'm anyone.
-Who's Andy García?

16:47.960 --> 16:50.920
Okay, well, I'm gonna go
while you boys hash that out.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.960
-Yeah.
-I'll see you both on the other side.

16:53.040 --> 16:55.520
-Thank you! Don't do that.
-Yeah! Yeah.

16:56.080 --> 16:59.840
I think that
Jackson is Rihanna in Ocean's Eight

17:00.440 --> 17:03.320
-Because of the bone structure and eyes.
-I've not seen it.

17:03.400 --> 17:04.240
-No?
-No.

17:04.320 --> 17:05.280
-Okay.
-But fine.

17:05.360 --> 17:06.400
It was very good.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.200
-Ugh, this fucking fringe.
-Aimee, can you please look at the road?

17:10.280 --> 17:11.600
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

17:12.720 --> 17:16.440
Right, come on. You and Otis kissed
in France. What happened?

17:17.400 --> 17:18.320
I don't know.

17:18.400 --> 17:20.320
My head's all over the place
at the moment.

17:20.400 --> 17:21.760
[breathes deeply]

17:21.840 --> 17:23.880
-Things are over with Isaac as well.
-Hmm.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.680
I feel bad about hurting his feelings.

17:25.760 --> 17:27.280
I'm sorry, babes.

17:27.960 --> 17:31.560
Does this mean you and Otis
might actually finally get together?

17:32.360 --> 17:33.360
I don't know.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.240
We've changed a lot,
so I don't know if it would work out.

17:36.800 --> 17:39.040
I think you should just
bloody go for it, love.

17:39.680 --> 17:41.440
It's like Simone de Beauvoir says,

17:41.520 --> 17:43.600
"From the hour you're born,
you begin to die."

17:44.120 --> 17:46.040
I think it means "live for the day."

17:47.280 --> 17:50.280
Yeah. Once I realized
she wasn't a lad called Simon,

17:50.360 --> 17:52.280
her writing started
to make a lot more sense.

17:52.360 --> 17:53.480
[chuckles]

17:53.560 --> 17:55.600
[pop music playing over stereo]

17:55.680 --> 17:58.240
I shouldn't have said
that stuff about you and Steve.

17:58.320 --> 18:00.520
I didn't mean it.
I think you're great together.

18:01.200 --> 18:03.560
No, you were right. It's not working out.

18:04.920 --> 18:06.760
-I'm sorry.
-[car horn honking]

18:06.840 --> 18:09.040
-Can you please look at the road?
-Sorry.

18:09.120 --> 18:10.800
[exhales]

18:11.400 --> 18:12.960
-I love you, love.
-I love you, love.

18:13.040 --> 18:15.360
-[Aimee] My concentration's not great.
-It's all right.

18:23.400 --> 18:28.200
I'm sure some of you probably had
your reservations about coming here today.

18:28.280 --> 18:32.040
[chuckles] I don't think anybody wants
to send their child to a school

18:32.120 --> 18:37.160
that's famous for STIs and sex musicals.

18:37.240 --> 18:40.480
But I'm here to assure prospective parents

18:40.560 --> 18:43.680
that these scandals are
a thing of the past.

18:44.240 --> 18:46.480
And so it is my promise to you

18:47.600 --> 18:51.040
that if you should choose
Sparkside Academy for your child,

18:51.120 --> 18:54.120
that they will receive their education
on a safe

18:54.200 --> 18:55.920
and sex-free campus…

18:56.000 --> 18:58.400
Sex-free camp-- People fuck in the bushes!

18:58.480 --> 19:01.800
We will protect our youth at all costs.

19:02.560 --> 19:06.640
Now, let's hear it from a shining example
of Sparkside's new ethos,

19:06.720 --> 19:08.440
Vivienne Odusanya.

19:09.120 --> 19:10.440
[cheering]

19:11.280 --> 19:13.080
-Here we go.
-Whoo!

19:13.680 --> 19:14.520
Come on, Viv!

19:16.760 --> 19:20.040
Thank you, Hope, for giving me
the opportunity to speak today.

19:20.120 --> 19:23.800
Firstly, I'd like to invite
Jackson Marchetti onstage

19:23.880 --> 19:26.880
to reclaim his position as head boy.

19:26.960 --> 19:29.560
[audience clapping, cheering]

19:30.920 --> 19:32.120
Whoo!

19:32.200 --> 19:33.400
Thank you, Viv.

19:34.760 --> 19:35.680
Ah.

19:36.280 --> 19:37.600
It's good to be back.

19:37.680 --> 19:40.840
We agree with Hope
that students should feel protected

19:40.920 --> 19:42.280
whilst on campus.

19:42.360 --> 19:45.880
The students of Moordale Secondary
would like to share some ideas

19:46.600 --> 19:47.680
on how we think

19:47.760 --> 19:49.600
listening to young people

19:49.680 --> 19:54.480
could make our new campus
the safest place to study in the UK.

19:55.840 --> 19:56.880
We hope you enjoy.

19:56.960 --> 19:58.840
What the hell is going on?

19:58.920 --> 20:00.720
[audience cheering]

20:06.600 --> 20:08.600
[screen motor whirring]

20:14.800 --> 20:17.000
-[Otis] It's a very slow screen.
-It is a slow screen.

20:17.800 --> 20:18.840
[whirring stops]

20:18.920 --> 20:21.040
And here we go.

20:22.640 --> 20:23.920
[upbeat music playing]

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
[audience clapping, cheering]

20:28.360 --> 20:31.200
Hi! We're the students of Sex School.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.080
You might recognize us from the press.

20:34.160 --> 20:37.560
We're the deviant youths
having loads of S-E-X.

20:38.080 --> 20:39.520
And catching chlamydia.

20:39.600 --> 20:41.400
And writing musicals about dicks!

20:41.480 --> 20:43.920
[Jackson] But I'm not embarrassed
to be a student of Sex School.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.840
Sex, well, it's part of being human.

20:45.920 --> 20:47.680
[Vivienne] Whoa!

20:47.760 --> 20:49.480
How did you let this happen?

20:50.040 --> 20:53.280
-I'm going to stop the video.
-Do it quickly. Don't make a scene.

20:53.360 --> 20:55.600
[Vivienne] …bodies and identities.

20:55.680 --> 20:58.000
[Jackson] Which is why
schools need safe spaces

20:58.080 --> 21:00.840
for people to ask those things
that some might find a little awkward,

21:00.920 --> 21:04.240
where there's no shame, stigma, or fear.

21:04.320 --> 21:06.360
[Vivienne] Because when shame
is used as a weapon,

21:06.440 --> 21:07.680
it doesn't just hurt people.

21:07.760 --> 21:09.400
It can damage them forever.

21:09.480 --> 21:12.400
But the opposite of shame is pride.

21:12.480 --> 21:17.040
And the students of Sex School are proud
of the things people like to shame us for.

21:17.120 --> 21:19.240
[Vivienne] Because if Lily Iglehart
is a weirdo

21:19.320 --> 21:21.960
for writing short stories
about aliens with penis hands,

21:22.040 --> 21:24.040
we're definitely weirdos too.

21:24.120 --> 21:26.360
[audience laughter, applause]

21:27.240 --> 21:30.560
[Aimee] I love my clitoris,
and I feel no shame.

21:30.640 --> 21:32.720
Ladies, get your wank on!

21:32.800 --> 21:34.320
[audience laughter, whistling]

21:34.400 --> 21:36.400
[mischievous music playing]

21:58.000 --> 22:00.360
I bind my chest, and I feel no shame!

22:00.440 --> 22:04.320
-I have a hairy bum, and I feel no shame.
-[audience laughing]

22:04.400 --> 22:06.480
[Ruby] I am literally perfect…

22:07.160 --> 22:09.240
Stop the video now!

22:09.760 --> 22:12.600
[Anwar] I'm great at anal douching,
and I feel no shame.

22:12.680 --> 22:14.720
-I'm great--
-That's not gonna do anything.

22:14.800 --> 22:15.920
There's nothing to see here.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.760
-Get out of my way!
-Eric!

22:26.440 --> 22:29.080
I'm great at anal douching.
I'm great at anal douching.

22:29.160 --> 22:30.720
I'm great at anal douching.

22:30.800 --> 22:32.920
[audience groaning]

22:33.000 --> 22:33.960
[Ruby] Drop the plug.

22:34.040 --> 22:35.800
-[Eric] What?
-[Otis] Ruby?

22:36.400 --> 22:38.320
-I said, drop it! Ah!
-[grunts]

22:38.400 --> 22:40.280
-[Otis] Ruby. Miss!
-[Eric] Miss!

22:40.360 --> 22:42.120
[grunts]

22:42.200 --> 22:43.680
-Oh my-- Is that?
-That's a burn.

22:43.760 --> 22:45.240
Ow! What are you doing?

22:45.320 --> 22:46.280
[Eric] Yes, yes.

22:46.360 --> 22:47.680
Oh my God! Wow!

22:47.760 --> 22:48.800
Ruby!

22:50.400 --> 22:51.400
[video continues playing]

22:51.480 --> 22:54.080
I'm great at anal douching,
and I feel no shame.

22:54.160 --> 22:55.160
Right.

22:55.240 --> 22:57.240
-[Eric] Ru-- Ruby!
-[Ruby exclaiming]

22:57.320 --> 22:59.680
[Eric] You cannot do that!
You mustn't do that!

23:00.840 --> 23:01.720
[audience groans]

23:04.200 --> 23:05.560
[screaming]

23:05.640 --> 23:07.840
-[Otis] Ow!
-[Eric] Oh God! Jeez!

23:07.920 --> 23:08.840
[Hope groans]

23:08.920 --> 23:09.960
[video continues playing]

23:10.040 --> 23:11.440
I'm great at anal douching…

23:11.520 --> 23:14.280
That is very expensive perfume.

23:14.360 --> 23:16.520
-You're incredible!
-I know.

23:16.600 --> 23:20.440
[Connor] I'm attracted to boys and girls,
and I'm trying not to feel shame.

23:20.520 --> 23:22.440
What have you done? [sighs]

23:22.520 --> 23:25.320
[girl] I have a third nipple,
and I have no shame.

23:26.400 --> 23:29.120
-[Otis sighs]
-Now, was that Fleurs du Mal?

23:29.200 --> 23:31.320
[girls moaning]

23:31.400 --> 23:33.720
-[girl 2] Come on! Come on!
-[Cal] What the fuck?

23:34.400 --> 23:36.600
-Oh, this school…
-[girl 2 moaning]

23:39.160 --> 23:42.640
A lot of shame comes from
old-fashioned views on sex.

23:42.720 --> 23:44.840
Sadly, schools have taught a lot of people

23:44.920 --> 23:47.640
to feel ashamed
of their identities and bodies.

23:47.720 --> 23:49.360
The cycle continues today.

23:49.440 --> 23:52.920
[Jackson] But the world is changing,
and young people have had enough.

23:53.000 --> 23:56.520
So if you agree that communication
and empathy are better tools

23:56.600 --> 23:58.240
than silence and shame,

23:58.320 --> 24:01.160
then join us

[woman] What's wrong
with schools teaching abstinence?

27:18.080 --> 27:20.480
Well, schools that teach abstinence

27:20.560 --> 27:24.080
actually have a higher rate
of teen pregnancies and STIs

27:24.160 --> 27:26.960
than schools
with comprehensive SRE programs.

27:27.040 --> 27:28.560
And when we give teens

27:28.640 --> 27:31.680
agency, information, and trust,

27:31.760 --> 27:33.560
there's a much higher success rate--

27:33.640 --> 27:35.160
Sorry, Dr. Milburn, apologies.

27:35.240 --> 27:38.800
It appears there's a situation developing
as we speak at Moordale Secondary.

Let's go live there now
to our reporter on the ground.

27:42.600 --> 27:44.440
[female reporter]
What was meant to be the day

27:44.520 --> 27:48.000
that Moordale Secondary squashed
the title of "Sex School"

27:48.080 --> 27:50.880
has evolved
into something quite the opposite.

27:50.960 --> 27:52.880
Students have taken to protest,

27:52.960 --> 27:56.160
doubling down
on their belief in sex positivity,

27:56.240 --> 27:59.600
and saying that
new head teacher Hope Haddon

27:59.680 --> 28:02.640
is quite simply behind the times.

28:02.720 --> 28:04.120

as kids all the time,

about something.

when someone is sick.

35:30.880 --> 35:33.480
-Like a beautiful soul. Know what I mean?
-Jackson. [chuckles]

35:34.120 --> 35:35.400
Don't worry about it. [chuckles]

35:35.920 --> 35:37.280
-Okay.
-Mm.

35:46.720 --> 35:48.240
I really didn't mean what I said.

35:50.560 --> 35:51.400
I'm sorry.

35:51.480 --> 35:54.000
No, it's… it's fine. It's okay.

35:54.800 --> 35:55.800
Okay.

36:02.320 --> 36:03.760
I just feel like I fucked up.

36:07.560 --> 36:08.800
Should we just stop?

36:12.760 --> 36:13.760
[chuckles]

36:14.600 --> 36:20.400
Um, yeah. I mean, you seem tense,
and now I'm tense too.

36:22.320 --> 36:23.200
Yeah.

36:23.880 --> 36:26.080
-We can try again another time.
-Yeah.

36:26.680 --> 36:27.560
Yeah.

36:40.040 --> 36:42.520
If this was going to become more serious,

36:42.600 --> 36:44.720
then you would be in a queer relationship.

36:44.800 --> 36:46.160
Is that okay with you?

36:48.560 --> 36:49.400
Yeah.

36:49.960 --> 36:52.520
Yeah, I haven't, like,
got a problem with that…

36:52.600 --> 36:53.640
Hm.

36:55.240 --> 36:56.120
…at all.

37:07.720 --> 37:09.880
[breathes deeply]

37:10.960 --> 37:12.120
-I have to go.
-What?

37:12.200 --> 37:15.160
Just… I just gotta help my mum out
with some stuff.

37:15.240 --> 37:16.400
-Oh yeah?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:17.320 --> 37:18.280
Okay.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.560
But I'm… Yeah, okay.

37:27.520 --> 37:29.040
-Bye.
-Bye.

37:34.880 --> 37:35.880
[thud]

37:39.960 --> 37:40.800
Ugh!

37:43.120 --> 37:45.640
You don't wanna do this, Mum.
That's why you called me.

37:45.720 --> 37:47.520
Don't tell me what I wanna do.

37:48.040 --> 37:51.040
Who is that girl who keeps staring at us?
She's freaking me out.

37:51.680 --> 37:54.000
It's my best friend, Aimee.
She gave me a ride here.

37:54.080 --> 37:56.320
-And what? Is she undercover, is she?
-No.

37:56.400 --> 37:57.440
Thanks very much.

37:57.960 --> 38:00.680
How am I supposed to know?
You're good at calling the police on me.

38:00.760 --> 38:04.040
-You have any idea how that fucked me up?
-You've been fucked up about it?

38:04.120 --> 38:07.120
-Try having your kid taken off you!
-Mum, I'm 17!

38:07.720 --> 38:11.640
-I should never have had to report you!
-I know I wasn't there for you, okay?

38:12.360 --> 38:16.080
But it's different with Elsie.
I'm gonna give her a better life.

38:17.640 --> 38:19.920
Mum, you can't stay clean.

38:21.160 --> 38:23.080
It doesn't make you a bad person.

38:23.160 --> 38:25.360
It's just Elsie needs someone
in her life who isn't using.

38:25.440 --> 38:26.320
What, like Anna?

38:27.400 --> 38:29.360
Can we go and see Anna?

38:32.880 --> 38:33.960
Come on, Els, let's go.

38:37.640 --> 38:39.960
Did you get onto that thing
for smart kids in America?

38:40.040 --> 38:43.520
-How'd you know about that?
-That boy Isaac told me about it.

38:45.400 --> 38:47.400
Yeah, I did, but I can't afford it.

38:47.480 --> 38:49.640
[Elsie] Mummy, I want to see Anna.

38:54.480 --> 38:56.160
Do you think Anna loves her?

38:57.680 --> 38:58.520
Yeah, I do.

39:04.800 --> 39:07.760
Hey. You're gonna stay with Maeve.

39:08.360 --> 39:11.680
-I wanna stay with you, Mummy.
-It's not very nice where I'm going.

39:11.760 --> 39:14.240
It rains all the time,
and there's no chips!

39:14.320 --> 39:15.440
I love you.

39:16.160 --> 39:17.520
Oh, I love you too, darling.

39:18.240 --> 39:21.120
[voice breaking] You go back to Anna's
with Maeve, and I'll visit.

39:21.200 --> 39:22.480
-[Erin sobs] Okay?
-Okay.

39:24.160 --> 39:27.600
Oh, I'm a lucky mummy.
Bye-bye, darling. Bye-bye.

39:28.160 --> 39:30.600
[sobs] Please just take her
before I change my mind.

39:30.680 --> 39:33.320

Can I come in?

40:05.160 --> 40:06.520
We missed you today.

40:08.240 --> 40:12.240
And the school realized
what Hope did to you guys was wrong.

40:13.160 --> 40:17.120
We all got together to fight
for what we wanted Moordale to be like.

40:17.840 --> 40:19.160
It was kind of amazing.

40:21.400 --> 40:22.880
[emotional music playing]

40:22.960 --> 40:24.560
It also made me kind of sad

40:25.840 --> 40:26.880
'cause, uh…

40:33.560 --> 40:36.720
I've realized
I've shut myself off recently.

40:38.640 --> 40:41.600
I stopped believing
it was my place to try and help anyone.

40:44.280 --> 40:45.960
I got hurt last term.

40:47.120 --> 40:47.960
Badly.

40:48.760 --> 40:50.920
And I didn't wanna do the clinic anymore.

40:53.440 --> 40:54.680
But that doesn't mean

40:55.360 --> 40:57.560
I shouldn't try and be a good friend.

40:59.920 --> 41:00.920
I saw you

41:02.280 --> 41:04.000
after Hope humiliated you.

41:04.720 --> 41:06.600
I didn't even ask if you were all right.

41:09.080 --> 41:10.480
I should've checked in.

41:11.240 --> 41:12.160
I'm…

41:12.760 --> 41:14.280
I'm really sorry I didn't.

41:15.160 --> 41:16.320
Ooh! [exhales]

41:17.640 --> 41:18.680
Why are you on the floor?

41:20.640 --> 41:23.800
Do you want some alien stuff?
I'm throwing it away.

41:25.080 --> 41:26.040
I'm okay.

41:26.560 --> 41:27.400
Thanks.

41:33.360 --> 41:35.320
Ola said you guys aren't speaking.

41:35.880 --> 41:37.240
We're kind of fighting.

41:39.160 --> 41:40.960
I think she's going through
a tough time too.

41:41.840 --> 41:43.360
She's really missing her mum.

41:46.280 --> 41:50.560
Maybe I've been a bit distracted,
but I'm not ready to talk to her yet.

41:53.840 --> 41:55.680
I didn't think we were friends.

41:55.760 --> 41:58.160
Well, I… I know we don't hang out much,

41:59.000 --> 42:00.480
but I think we like each other.

42:01.600 --> 42:03.320
Meh, you're all right.

42:05.120 --> 42:06.760
I know what you mean about shutting off.

42:07.360 --> 42:08.440
I do that, too,

42:09.640 --> 42:14.320
when I'm hurt
or I feel like I don't fit in.

42:21.120 --> 42:22.640
What do you do when you shut off?

42:23.680 --> 42:24.880
Hm.

42:24.960 --> 42:26.320
Think about my stories.

42:27.400 --> 42:31.720
About alien planets and galaxies.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.960
I used to do it all the time
when I was a kid, but…

42:38.720 --> 42:41.000
I guess it's just weird
now that I'm getting older.

42:43.320 --> 42:45.240
It's really common

42:45.320 --> 42:48.920
for people to create
rich fantasy worlds to escape into.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
It's what most artists do.

42:51.520 --> 42:54.080
They are brave enough
to show the weirdest,

42:54.160 --> 42:56.480
most vulnerable sides
of themselves in their work.

42:57.080 --> 42:59.480
Which helps a lot of people
not feel as alone.

42:59.560 --> 43:00.560
Thanks, Otis.

43:01.600 --> 43:03.360
But I don't think I'm an artist.

43:05.680 --> 43:07.080
I wouldn't be so sure.

43:07.840 --> 43:11.680
And even if you do decide
to not write about aliens anymore,

43:13.160 --> 43:16.320
you shouldn't ever give someone
the power to humiliate you.

43:17.360 --> 43:18.400
You're great.

43:19.160 --> 43:20.400

Maeve, I know
you don't like emotional shit,

how you don't really have a proper mum,

that even though my mum has money,

51:19.160 --> 51:21.160
she's also crap sometimes too.
