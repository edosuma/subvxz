00:09.147 --> 00:10.424
-I don't know about
this, Rhydian.

00:10.458 --> 00:11.770
-Just trust me, OK?

00:11.804 --> 00:13.289
I know exactly what I'm doing.

00:13.323 --> 00:14.462
Just don't move.

00:16.878 --> 00:18.466
-There's no way you
can do this.

00:24.162 --> 00:25.508
-[exhales]

00:32.686 --> 00:34.172
[interposing voices]

00:34.206 --> 00:35.863
-OK, let's see, come on.

00:38.659 --> 00:42.180
-It's like watching one of those
nature films, but not as

00:42.214 --> 00:43.353
educational.

00:48.255 --> 00:49.394
-Go for it.

00:53.432 --> 00:59.369
[laughter]

00:59.404 --> 01:01.199
-Whoa.

01:01.233 --> 01:02.648
How is that even possible?

01:09.172 --> 01:10.484
THEME SONG: A promise
that I keep.

01:10.518 --> 01:12.865
I'll never share, I'll
never speak.

01:12.900 --> 01:17.215
To my grave the secret goes.

01:17.249 --> 01:19.596
The beating heart, the
beating heart.

01:19.631 --> 01:21.495
Where mystic creatures
wandered far.

01:21.529 --> 01:25.326
Through these a wolfblood
flows.

01:25.361 --> 01:30.124
A change will come I know
behold my future.

01:30.159 --> 01:32.471
A promise that I keep.

01:32.506 --> 01:34.370
I'll never share, I'll
never speak.

01:34.404 --> 01:36.337
Through these veins
a wolfblood flows.

01:39.651 --> 01:41.135
-Oy.

01:41.170 --> 01:42.274
Oy, you.

01:44.276 --> 01:44.966
-Hey, Mads.

01:45.001 --> 01:46.658
-Don't hey Mads me.

01:46.692 --> 01:47.900
What just happened?

01:47.935 --> 01:50.627
-I've been putting in
a lot of practice.

01:50.662 --> 01:51.835
-This is me.

01:51.870 --> 01:53.389
I know what we can
and can't do.

01:53.423 --> 01:56.702
And what you just pulled
off is not on the list.

01:56.737 --> 01:58.256
-You're a real pain,
you know that?

01:58.290 --> 01:59.533
-Uh-hm.

01:59.567 --> 02:01.224
-Do you really wanna know?

02:01.259 --> 02:02.363
-Spill.

02:04.745 --> 02:06.264
-Not here.

02:06.298 --> 02:08.610
Meet me in the woods
after school.

02:08.645 --> 02:12.304
[school bell ringing]

02:12.339 --> 02:13.788
-Focus on my eyes.

02:13.823 --> 02:16.481
-OK.

02:16.515 --> 02:19.000
-OK, don't get all
creepy on me.

02:19.035 --> 02:19.725
Just--

02:19.760 --> 02:20.830
just relax.

02:20.864 --> 02:23.453
Breathe.

02:23.488 --> 02:27.319
Mum told me that the wildbloods
call it Eolas.

02:27.354 --> 02:31.875
She said you can't just look,
you have to feel, feel what's

02:31.910 --> 02:34.464
under you, feel what's
around you.

02:34.499 --> 02:36.811
If you can, you'll connect to
your oldest instincts, your

02:36.846 --> 02:37.916
primal nature.

02:37.950 --> 02:40.021
And then you'll know
what Eolas is.

02:40.056 --> 02:41.885
-Shh.

02:41.920 --> 02:43.508
I'm trying to focus here.

02:55.865 --> 02:56.969
-Are you OK?

03:11.881 --> 03:18.646
-I can see everything,
hear everything.

03:18.681 --> 03:19.820
This is amazing.

03:26.482 --> 03:27.828
RHYDIAN [OFFSCREEN]: Maddy!

03:27.862 --> 03:29.726
Maddy, not that way.

03:29.761 --> 03:33.074
Maddy, wait!

03:33.109 --> 03:33.627
Maddy!

03:33.661 --> 03:34.766
-Whoa!

03:37.907 --> 03:40.323
RHYDIAN [OFFSCREEN]: Maddy!

03:40.358 --> 03:41.773
-Ah!

03:41.807 --> 03:51.023
[piercing noise]

03:51.058 --> 03:51.886
-Snap out of it.

03:51.921 --> 03:52.991
-[groans]

03:53.025 --> 03:55.304
-You're near the pylon.

03:55.338 --> 03:57.375
Maddy!

03:57.409 --> 03:58.548
Maddy, wake up.

04:03.795 --> 04:05.417
-What just happened?

04:05.452 --> 04:08.524
-Seriously, Maddy, you've got to
be careful with this stuff.

04:08.558 --> 04:10.457
-You did what?

04:10.491 --> 04:12.321
-Emm, go easy.

04:12.355 --> 04:14.530
-I don't see the problem, Mom.

04:14.564 --> 04:15.772
It's amazing.

04:15.807 --> 04:17.394
-It's not amazing.

04:17.428 --> 04:18.741
It's dangerous.

04:18.774 --> 04:19.880
-Well, how would you know if
you've never tried it?

04:19.914 --> 04:22.019
-That's not the point.

04:22.053 --> 04:23.711
-I'm the one who should
be upset.

04:23.746 --> 04:26.818
I'm the one who had to find out
from someone else's mom.

04:26.852 --> 04:28.544
-Ceri taught you
how to do this?

04:28.578 --> 04:31.754
-Uh, no, she taught me and
then I taught Maddy.

04:31.788 --> 04:33.411
It just went a-- a bit wrong.

04:33.445 --> 04:34.619
-A bit wrong?

04:34.653 --> 04:36.137
She passed out.

04:36.172 --> 04:38.623
That's exactly why we didn't
want you finding out about

04:38.657 --> 04:40.003
this nonsense.

04:40.038 --> 04:41.315
-I think Maddy's right.

04:41.350 --> 04:43.766
I think it was our
job to tell her--

04:43.800 --> 04:46.389
uh, my job.

04:46.424 --> 04:46.976
I've been there.

04:47.010 --> 04:48.115
I've done that.

04:50.117 --> 04:51.394
-You've used Eolas.

04:51.429 --> 04:52.844
-I dabbled a bit when
I was younger.

04:52.878 --> 04:53.914
-Dan.

04:53.948 --> 04:55.364
-What?

04:55.398 --> 04:57.469
It was fun, as long as you
keep it in the wild.

04:57.504 --> 05:00.058
She only came across it because
of the electricity.

05:00.092 --> 05:01.370
It's no one's fault.

05:03.613 --> 05:04.959
-I think you'd better
go home, Rhydian.

05:10.827 --> 05:11.966
-See you tomorrow, Mads.

05:15.694 --> 05:18.870
[door closes]

05:18.904 --> 05:20.561
-Well, that was rude.

05:20.596 --> 05:22.667
-I don't want you messing
with it again.

05:22.701 --> 05:24.151
Do you understand?

05:24.185 --> 05:26.636
Eolas wrecks families, lives.

05:26.671 --> 05:28.880
-The only person wrecking
things is you.

05:32.918 --> 05:34.679
-Nice job, very supportive.

05:34.713 --> 05:38.199
-[chuckles]

05:38.234 --> 05:40.029
EMMA [OFFSCREEN]: We're
supposed to be a team.

05:40.063 --> 05:41.617
DANIEL [OFFSCREEN]: Yeah,
my thoughts exactly.

05:41.651 --> 05:42.825
EMMA [OFFSCREEN]: Don't you
care about your daughter?

05:42.859 --> 05:43.722
DANIEL [OFFSCREEN]:
Of course I care.

05:43.757 --> 05:44.758
I'm talking about you.

05:44.792 --> 05:46.104
This is my opinion, and this--

05:46.138 --> 05:48.002
[music playing]

05:51.420 --> 05:52.697
-Yeah, wait.

05:52.731 --> 05:53.939
Come on, come on.

05:53.974 --> 05:55.527
-You know Jeffries will
confiscate those?

05:55.562 --> 05:57.840
-I'm terrified.

05:57.874 --> 05:59.876
-First she had a go at
me and then Dad.

05:59.911 --> 06:03.915
She's driving us nuts, like
I'm still some cub.

06:03.949 --> 06:04.778
-Some what?

06:04.812 --> 06:06.883
-Nothing.

06:06.918 --> 06:08.057
-15 seconds.

06:10.093 --> 06:12.820
-What are you doing?

06:12.855 --> 06:15.996
Using Eolas, in here?

06:16.030 --> 06:18.895
Well, glad to see you're putting
your primal nature to

06:18.930 --> 06:20.069
such good use.

06:22.934 --> 06:24.694
-Tha--

06:24.729 --> 06:27.973
well, this is a pleasant
surprise.

06:36.534 --> 06:37.120
MADDY [OFFSCREEN]: Dad, you OK?

06:37.155 --> 06:38.259
-Ah!

06:38.294 --> 06:41.642
Oh, Maddy, don't creep
up on a person.

06:41.677 --> 06:42.574
Oh.

06:42.609 --> 06:44.438
-What are you doing?

06:44.473 --> 06:46.544
-Uh, yoga.

06:46.578 --> 06:47.061
[coughs]

06:47.096 --> 06:48.062
Yeah.

06:48.097 --> 06:49.754
No, just doing a bit of yoga.

06:49.788 --> 06:51.169
It's, uh, it's very
good, you know.

06:51.203 --> 06:52.584
It's tough.

06:52.619 --> 06:53.274
Ooh.

06:53.309 --> 06:54.621
Oh, but it's good.

06:54.655 --> 06:55.794
-Oh, really?

06:55.829 --> 06:58.763
-[chuckles]

06:58.797 --> 07:01.041
-You're a terrible liar, Dad.

07:01.075 --> 07:02.214
-Oh, I'll take that
as a compliment.

07:07.772 --> 07:13.191
-Dad, how old were you when you
first learned about Eolas?

07:13.225 --> 07:15.089
-Well--

07:15.124 --> 07:17.298
16, 17.

07:17.333 --> 07:18.748
-Why did you stop?

07:18.783 --> 07:21.475
-I met your mom.

07:21.510 --> 07:23.788
And, uh, she's always been one
for emphasizing the human.

07:23.822 --> 07:25.548
You know what she's like.

07:25.583 --> 07:27.067
She's right, mostly.

07:27.101 --> 07:30.726
So it's us to fit in, not
the other way around.

07:30.760 --> 07:35.524
-I just don't see why we can't
fit in and be special.

07:35.558 --> 07:38.527
Why can't you do it anymore?

07:38.561 --> 07:39.735
-Don't know.

07:39.769 --> 07:42.151
Maybe if you don't use
it, you lose it.

07:42.185 --> 07:43.324
Maybe it's just beyond me now.

07:43.359 --> 07:44.774
I mean, it has been decades.

07:44.809 --> 07:46.293
-It's awful.

07:46.327 --> 07:48.709
-Well, it's not like I
need it or anything.

08:03.379 --> 08:04.242
-Dad?

08:04.276 --> 08:05.312
-Madeline?

08:05.346 --> 08:06.900
-Are you and Mom OK?

08:06.934 --> 08:08.177
-[chuckles]

08:08.211 --> 08:09.523
Course we are.

08:09.558 --> 08:11.698
-Well, I heard you fighting
last night.

08:11.732 --> 08:12.768
-[chuckles]

08:12.802 --> 08:13.631
And how often does
that happen?

08:13.665 --> 08:15.356
-Never, that's my point.

08:15.391 --> 08:17.255
-Sweet heart, we're fine.

08:17.289 --> 08:19.568
Your mom's just a bit worried
about you, that's all.

08:19.602 --> 08:22.571
-It wasn't all about me.

08:22.605 --> 08:24.124
-Maddy, [sighs]

08:24.158 --> 08:28.162
as you grow older, you'll
realize that relationships

08:28.197 --> 08:29.025
aren't easy.

08:29.060 --> 08:31.200
And these things happen.

08:31.234 --> 08:32.683
-Where is Mom, anyway?

08:47.216 --> 08:48.838
-Are you looking for
me, Mrs. Smith?

08:51.841 --> 08:53.360
How can I help you?

08:53.394 --> 08:57.053
-You can help by promising not
to use Eolas around Maddy, or

08:57.088 --> 08:58.330
encourage her in any way.

08:58.365 --> 09:00.056
I don't even want you
talking about it.

09:00.091 --> 09:01.610
Do you understand?

09:01.644 --> 09:03.335
-Can't really tell us what we're
allowed to talk about.

09:03.370 --> 09:04.854
-That's exactly what
I'm doing.

09:04.889 --> 09:06.407
-Don't you think you're being
a bit unreasonable?

09:06.442 --> 09:08.168
-If you though about someone
other than yourself for once,

09:08.202 --> 09:10.411
you'd realize this is
for her own good.

09:10.446 --> 09:12.034
Do we have an agreement?

09:12.068 --> 09:13.000
-Has Maddy agreed to this?

09:13.035 --> 09:16.038
-I'm telling you, not Maddy.

09:16.072 --> 09:18.074
-All right, I'll do it--

09:18.109 --> 09:19.593
if Maddy agrees.

09:19.628 --> 09:21.802
-Right, that's it, you're
not seeing her again.

09:21.837 --> 09:22.803
-Excuse me.

09:22.838 --> 09:24.011
-You're not seeing her again.

09:24.046 --> 09:25.357
-We're in the same class.

09:25.392 --> 09:27.670
-Then I forbid you to see
her out of class.

09:39.130 --> 09:41.995
-Before electricity, most
wolfbloods lived in towns--

09:42.029 --> 09:43.617
well, on the outskirts anyway.

09:43.652 --> 09:47.000
And Eolas was just taken for
granted, a way to stay

09:47.034 --> 09:49.002
connected to the power.

09:49.036 --> 09:50.244
Hello, where did you get to?

09:50.279 --> 09:51.901
-I went to see Rhydian.

09:51.936 --> 09:53.075
-Rhydian?

09:53.109 --> 09:55.008
-You're not to hang out
with him anymore.

09:55.042 --> 09:57.113
-[scoffs]

09:57.148 --> 09:58.356
Excuse me?

09:58.390 --> 09:59.875
-Outside of school, he's
persona non grata.

09:59.909 --> 10:00.876
Do I make myself clear?

10:00.910 --> 10:02.015
-No.

10:02.049 --> 10:03.395
No, you do not make
yourself clear.

10:03.430 --> 10:04.880
You can't tell us what to do.

10:04.914 --> 10:06.640
-Well, yes I can, young lady.

10:06.675 --> 10:08.815
You're not seeing him again
until both of you promise me

10:08.849 --> 10:11.783
to my face that you'll never
use Eolas ever again.

10:11.818 --> 10:15.028
-How dare you just come in here
and talk to me like that.

10:15.062 --> 10:18.238
I'm a wolfblood now, not some
little cub you can just boss

10:18.272 --> 10:19.722
around.

10:19.757 --> 10:21.068
-In my house, under my rules,
you are a cub-- our cub.

10:21.103 --> 10:24.140
And you'll do as you're told.

10:24.175 --> 10:24.969
-Dad doesn't agree.

10:25.003 --> 10:26.971
-[chuckles]

10:27.005 --> 10:28.144
-Tell her.

10:33.149 --> 10:34.150
Oh, great.

10:34.185 --> 10:35.082
You're scared of her.

10:35.117 --> 10:35.738
-No.

10:35.773 --> 10:36.774
No, I'm not.

10:36.808 --> 10:37.947
-Yeah, you are.

10:37.982 --> 10:39.052
You're both scared.

10:39.086 --> 10:42.987
We're wolfbloods,
Mom, not humans.

10:43.021 --> 10:44.022
And Eolas is mine.

10:44.057 --> 10:45.092
So I can do what
I want with it.

10:45.127 --> 10:46.887
-Madeline, you get back here.

10:46.922 --> 10:48.820
I'm talking to you.

10:48.855 --> 10:50.753
-You handled that well.

10:50.788 --> 10:52.272
-Yeah, well, somebody had to.

10:52.306 --> 10:56.034
-You know, mostly speaking,
living with two alpha females

10:56.069 --> 10:57.484
is a total joy ride.

10:57.518 --> 10:58.865
But this has to stop.

10:58.899 --> 11:00.176
-Yeah, well, do more
to control your

11:00.211 --> 11:01.350
daughter and it will.

11:08.875 --> 11:10.773
[owl hooting]

11:50.399 --> 11:51.089
-What's happened?

11:51.124 --> 11:52.332
-Me mother.

11:52.366 --> 11:53.954
Can you put us up
for a few days?

11:53.989 --> 11:54.886
-Can I what?

11:54.921 --> 11:56.094
-Rhydian, please?

11:56.129 --> 11:57.095
She's driving us mad.

11:57.130 --> 11:58.787
I can't live with her anymore.

11:58.821 --> 12:00.305
-Maddy, do you have any idea
what your mom would do to me?

12:00.340 --> 12:01.375
-She doesn't have to know.

12:01.410 --> 12:02.998
-Oh, no.

12:03.032 --> 12:04.240
Because she'd never be able to
track you back to my house.

12:04.275 --> 12:06.553
What was I thinking?

12:06.587 --> 12:08.210
She told you what
she said to me?

12:08.244 --> 12:11.489
-Yeah, that I'm not allowed to
see you outside of school.

12:11.523 --> 12:13.146
It's ridiculous.

12:13.180 --> 12:16.874
-Well, maybe you should just
take it on the chin, knuckle

12:16.908 --> 12:18.082
under, and wait for
it to calm down.

12:18.116 --> 12:19.600
-No way.

12:19.635 --> 12:20.912
What's wrong with every one?

12:20.947 --> 12:22.949
All I want to do is
live my life as a

12:22.983 --> 12:24.882
wolfblood, which I am.

12:24.916 --> 12:27.988
I'm sick of being lied
to and manipulated.

12:28.023 --> 12:30.439
-You know your parents care
about you, even if they have

12:30.473 --> 12:31.509
got a weird way of showing it.

12:31.543 --> 12:32.993
-They don't care about us.

12:33.028 --> 12:35.340
They're just scared of
being wolfbloods.

12:35.375 --> 12:36.617
-Hang on.

12:36.652 --> 12:37.998
I'd give my canines to
have what you have.

12:38.033 --> 12:40.242
Stop being such a brat
and go home.

12:40.276 --> 12:42.140
-Great.

12:42.175 --> 12:43.970
Well, thanks for all
the support.

12:44.004 --> 12:45.212
-Oh, come on.

12:45.247 --> 12:46.627
Look, it'll work out.

12:46.662 --> 12:47.559
You know it will.

12:47.594 --> 12:48.940
Where are you going?

12:48.975 --> 12:50.114
-What do you care?

12:56.983 --> 12:58.812
-[sighs]

12:58.847 --> 13:00.262
Her uniform's gone.

13:00.296 --> 13:01.919
-Well, maybe she just didn't
feel like having breakfast

13:01.953 --> 13:03.230
with us.

13:03.265 --> 13:05.060
-And some of her clothes
and-- and her rucksack.

13:05.094 --> 13:06.130
-Oh, right, OK.

13:06.164 --> 13:07.303
Well, sorry to trouble you.

13:07.338 --> 13:08.649
And, uh, thanks anyway.

13:08.684 --> 13:09.374
-OK.

13:09.409 --> 13:11.135
-Take care, bye.

13:11.169 --> 13:13.033
Rhydian's gone to school
as normal, she said.

13:20.178 --> 13:21.490
-Where is she?

13:21.524 --> 13:23.078
-I haven't seen her since
late last night.

13:23.112 --> 13:24.976
-You saw her last night?

13:25.011 --> 13:26.150
-She came to mine.

13:26.184 --> 13:27.323
But I told her to go
home and she left.

13:27.358 --> 13:29.015
-So she's not been
to school today?

13:29.049 --> 13:30.085
-No.

13:30.119 --> 13:31.500
-Well, where's Tom
and Shannon?

13:31.534 --> 13:33.502
-They're in class, but they
haven't seen her either.

13:33.536 --> 13:34.296
-Well, how do you know?

13:34.330 --> 13:35.953
-Trust me, I know.

13:35.987 --> 13:37.368
-Don't worry, she's
making a point.

13:37.402 --> 13:40.198
We'll find her in the woods
somewhere cooling off.

13:40.233 --> 13:41.165
-I'll come with you.

13:41.199 --> 13:41.924
-No, you can't miss school.

13:41.959 --> 13:42.614
We'll find her.

13:42.649 --> 13:43.857
-But I can see her.

13:43.892 --> 13:45.963
We don't need you
seeing anything.

13:45.997 --> 13:48.897
-You think a wolfblood can't
track their own cubs?

13:48.931 --> 13:50.277
-Thanks anyway.

13:50.312 --> 13:53.004
-Mr. and Mrs. Smith, what
do we owe the pleasure?

13:53.039 --> 13:54.143
-Maddy's not well.

13:54.178 --> 13:55.696
-Ah, well, I'm sorry
to hear that.

13:55.731 --> 13:58.630
-Yeah, so, um, we came to ask
Rhydian to bring any homework

13:58.665 --> 13:59.908
that she might get.

13:59.942 --> 14:01.633
So, uh, thanks, Rhydian.

14:01.668 --> 14:03.463
And, uh, bye, Mr. Jeffries.

14:03.497 --> 14:04.636
-Bye.

14:27.487 --> 14:30.697
-Emm, can you smell that?

14:30.731 --> 14:32.561
[sniffs]

14:38.498 --> 14:40.155
-You still mad at me?

14:40.189 --> 14:41.294
-What do you think?

14:41.328 --> 14:42.640
You pushed her to this.

14:42.674 --> 14:43.365
-Yeah, I know.

14:43.399 --> 14:44.745
-Well, why?

14:44.780 --> 14:46.506
You haven't given us a
decent reason why.

14:46.540 --> 14:49.026
-Do you remember me telling
you about Louise?

14:49.060 --> 14:51.304
-Your cousin who moved away
when you were at school?

14:51.338 --> 14:53.616
-She didn't move away.

14:53.651 --> 14:55.308
She ran away.

14:55.342 --> 14:56.309
-Why?

14:56.343 --> 14:57.448
-Because she discovered Eolas.

15:04.317 --> 15:07.976
It's all she ever talked about,
all she cared about.

15:08.010 --> 15:11.703
And she didn't have any time
for me anymore or family.

15:11.738 --> 15:13.464
She was playing truant
every day, and

15:13.498 --> 15:15.121
then she just vanished.

15:18.434 --> 15:20.160
We finally had no choice
but to call the police.

15:20.195 --> 15:22.991
But as far as they were
concerned, she was just

15:23.025 --> 15:25.648
another missing young girl--

15:25.683 --> 15:26.926
still is.

15:28.755 --> 15:30.067
But we knew better.

15:30.101 --> 15:32.241
-She ran wild.

15:32.276 --> 15:34.209
Why did you never
tell us this?

15:34.243 --> 15:37.108
-Because I keep thinking that
she's going to come back.

15:37.143 --> 15:38.247
-Oh.

15:40.525 --> 15:43.735
-We're gonna find Maddy,
I promise.

15:43.770 --> 15:45.013
-Ow!

15:47.567 --> 15:49.293
-Maddy!

15:49.327 --> 15:50.432
-Madeline!

15:53.435 --> 15:54.539
-Maddy!

15:57.163 --> 15:58.647
-I've got a scent.

15:58.681 --> 16:00.028
-No, it's this way.

16:14.249 --> 16:15.388
-Where'd she go?

16:23.085 --> 16:24.190
-I can find her.

16:34.407 --> 16:35.339
MADDY [OFFSCREEN]: Stop.

16:35.373 --> 16:36.512
Traitor.

16:36.547 --> 16:38.825
You're supposed to be on
my side, our side.

16:38.859 --> 16:40.620
-Maddy, you don't know
what you're doing.

16:40.654 --> 16:42.208
MADDY [OFFSCREEN]: No, you don't
know what you're doing,

16:42.242 --> 16:43.036
helping them.

16:43.071 --> 16:44.175
This is who we are.

16:44.210 --> 16:45.832
This is what we're
meant to be.

16:45.866 --> 16:47.420
-Maddy, listen to me.

16:47.454 --> 16:48.835
MADDY [OFFSCREEN]:
No, you listen.

16:48.869 --> 16:50.285
You lied to us.

16:50.319 --> 16:53.598
You knew about Eolas, and
withheld it from us.

16:53.633 --> 16:55.290
You withheld me birth right.

16:55.324 --> 16:56.739
-But I'm sorry.

16:56.774 --> 16:57.395
It's my fault.

16:57.430 --> 16:58.189
Come out.

16:58.224 --> 16:59.087
We'll talk about it.

16:59.121 --> 17:00.398
-Eolas is our birth right.

17:00.433 --> 17:02.228
And I'll use it how I please.

17:02.262 --> 17:03.643
-Well, that's just it.

17:03.677 --> 17:04.575
You're not using it, Maddy.

17:04.608 --> 17:05.886
It's using you.

17:05.921 --> 17:07.612
MADDY [OFFSCREEN]: Come
and get us, then.

17:07.646 --> 17:09.131
-Maddy, wait!

17:47.514 --> 17:48.619
I've lost her.

18:03.427 --> 18:16.716
[piercing noise]

18:21.479 --> 18:24.310
-Sorry, Mrs. S. If I'd known
this would happen, I wouldn't

18:24.344 --> 18:27.175
have let Maddy anywhere
near Eolas.

18:27.209 --> 18:30.730
-What I don't understand is why
you're not crazy with it.

18:30.764 --> 18:32.525
-Don't know.

18:32.559 --> 18:36.356
Maybe it just in my genes, my
mom being wild and all.

18:36.391 --> 18:39.773
-Well, I appreciate your helping
us and any trouble you

18:39.808 --> 18:43.329
get into missing school, we'll
come up with something to

18:43.363 --> 18:45.917
explain it.

18:45.952 --> 18:46.746
-Thanks.

18:46.780 --> 18:47.885
-It's OK.

19:17.880 --> 19:19.882
-Where exactly are we going?

19:19.917 --> 19:20.780
She could be anywhere.

19:20.814 --> 19:21.850
-Just keep going.

19:21.884 --> 19:23.369
-Can you see her?

19:23.403 --> 19:26.648
-No, it's just a feeling.

19:26.682 --> 19:27.614
Ah!

19:27.649 --> 19:29.547
[piercing noise]

19:29.582 --> 19:30.928
-Get us away from
those pylons.

19:35.346 --> 19:47.047
[sirens]

19:47.082 --> 19:52.536
[piercing noise]

20:02.580 --> 20:03.685
-Stop the car, that's it.

20:03.719 --> 20:04.582
That's the truck.

20:04.617 --> 20:05.273
-Where's Maddy.

20:05.307 --> 20:07.240
Can you see her?

20:07.275 --> 20:08.931
-Rhydian?

20:08.966 --> 20:10.209
Rhydian.

20:14.282 --> 20:15.283
DANIEL [OFFSCREEN]:
Let's get him to a

20:15.317 --> 20:15.800
park, closer to nature.

20:19.114 --> 20:20.046
-Come on.

20:20.080 --> 20:21.254
We've got you.

20:21.289 --> 20:23.049
-Come on, that's it.

20:23.083 --> 20:24.361
You'll be OK.

20:32.300 --> 20:33.646
-[sniffles]

20:33.680 --> 20:34.992
[whimpering]

20:35.026 --> 20:36.269
-Wait here.

20:40.411 --> 20:41.723
-Please, Rhydian, try.

20:41.757 --> 20:43.863
If you're in this state,
imagine how she feels.

20:48.971 --> 20:50.110
-No, can't do it here.

20:50.145 --> 20:51.077
I'm sorry.

20:51.111 --> 20:51.802
-T-- try again.

20:51.836 --> 20:52.734
-Emm, enough.

20:52.768 --> 20:54.080
You're torturing the boy.

20:54.114 --> 20:55.357
-Our daughter's out
there in pain.

20:55.392 --> 20:58.326
-Yeah, I know that.

20:58.360 --> 20:59.465
Let me try.

21:05.712 --> 21:07.990
-You don't look happy.

21:08.025 --> 21:09.820
You look a right state.

21:09.854 --> 21:10.993
Been on this long?

21:13.444 --> 21:14.928
I'm Jude.

21:14.963 --> 21:16.344
-Maddy.

21:16.378 --> 21:17.517
-So what you running
away from, Maddy?

21:20.071 --> 21:22.522
-I don't know anymore.

21:22.557 --> 21:23.420
-Don't cry.

21:23.454 --> 21:24.628
It will be all right.

21:24.662 --> 21:26.319
-I don't even know
why I'm here.

21:29.184 --> 21:31.842
I hate to say, um,
me head hurts.

21:31.876 --> 21:32.981
-Maybe you need some food.

21:36.053 --> 21:40.644
I'd get you a burger or
something, but I'm skint.

21:40.678 --> 21:42.646
-I've got money.

21:42.680 --> 21:43.819
-Yeah?

21:46.063 --> 21:47.582
Where?

21:47.616 --> 21:50.101
In your, uh, rucksack, is it?

21:53.484 --> 21:55.037
-Just relax, Dan.

21:55.072 --> 21:55.693
You're tense.

21:55.728 --> 21:56.694
-I'm trying.

21:56.729 --> 21:57.695
-But you're not supposed
to try.

22:01.216 --> 22:02.044
-Where are you going?

22:02.079 --> 22:02.942
-To find our daughter.

22:02.976 --> 22:04.392
Stay there with Rhydian.

22:19.234 --> 22:21.063
-Where you going?

22:21.098 --> 22:22.617
There's no help down there.

22:37.563 --> 22:40.082
Just give me the rucksack
and you won't get hurt.

22:43.707 --> 22:44.846
-[growls]

22:44.880 --> 22:45.916
-Are you--

22:45.950 --> 22:47.538
are you growling at me?

22:47.573 --> 22:48.850
[laughs]

22:48.884 --> 22:49.678
She's growling at me.

22:49.713 --> 22:50.783
[laughter]

22:50.817 --> 22:52.888
-[growls]

22:52.923 --> 22:55.201
[laughter]

22:58.756 --> 23:00.965
-Give it me.

23:01.000 --> 23:01.932
-[growls]

23:01.966 --> 23:03.382
-[screams]

23:06.557 --> 23:09.491
-Get away from my daughter.

23:09.526 --> 23:11.424
[growling]

23:17.568 --> 23:20.951
-Like werewolves, do you?

23:20.985 --> 23:22.746
Well, they don't like you.

23:22.780 --> 23:23.263
[growls]

23:23.298 --> 23:26.508
[screams]

23:26.543 --> 23:27.647
-Mom.

23:30.547 --> 23:31.927
I'm sorry.

23:31.962 --> 23:33.135
I'm so sorry.

23:33.170 --> 23:34.620
-It's OK, pet.

23:34.654 --> 23:36.794
You're safe now.

23:36.829 --> 23:39.452
You're safe.

23:39.487 --> 23:42.075
I'm never using Eolas again.

23:52.672 --> 23:55.537
I'm sorry about the mean
things that I said.

23:55.572 --> 23:57.574
-What mean things?

23:57.608 --> 23:58.954
Mom said I've got
you to thank.

23:58.989 --> 24:00.818
You're the one who
tracked us down.

24:00.853 --> 24:04.650
-I lost you once you jumped
in the back of that truck.

24:04.684 --> 24:07.825
-So how exactly did
you find us?

24:07.860 --> 24:09.171
-Good old fashioned scent.

24:09.206 --> 24:11.967
Like I told Rhydian, a wolfblood
can always track

24:12.002 --> 24:12.830
their cub.

24:12.865 --> 24:14.314
-Mom, how many times?

24:14.349 --> 24:15.592
I'm not a cub.

24:15.626 --> 24:17.041
-Don't you flash your
eyes at me.

24:17.076 --> 24:18.215
-Well, stop calling us a cub.

24:18.249 --> 24:19.872
-Well, stop behaving like
one and I will.

24:19.906 --> 24:21.977
-Stop treating us like one and
I'll stop behaving like one.

24:22.012 --> 24:23.910
-You don't set the
rules, Maddy.

24:23.945 --> 24:25.498
-What's it got to
do with rules?

24:25.533 --> 24:26.982
-It's got everything
to do with rules.

24:27.017 --> 24:28.984
-Why are you changing
the subject?

24:29.019 --> 24:30.330
-I'm not changing the subject.

24:30.365 --> 24:31.780
-Well, you obviously are.

24:31.815 --> 24:33.610
-Mostly speaking, living
with two alpha females

24:33.644 --> 24:35.266
is a total joy ride.

24:35.301 --> 24:37.027
-Ha.

24:37.061 --> 24:42.066
