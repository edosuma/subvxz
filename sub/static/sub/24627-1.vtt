01:13.606 --> 01:16.904
Do not be afraid, child.

01:17.123 --> 01:19.200
You must be Harker's boy.

01:19.201 --> 01:20.800
Yes.

01:21.678 --> 01:24.336
Quincey, sir. Of course you are!

01:27.053 --> 01:29.031
The devil has returned.

01:29.570 --> 01:30.688
Van Helsing!

01:30.689 --> 01:34.046
Was delicious.

01:36.963 --> 01:42.038
Did you really think you
could flee to the Americas

01:42.238 --> 01:45.235
and I would not find you?

01:50.050 --> 01:51.647
Go to the house.

01:51.648 --> 01:56.083
House Harker... how delightful!

01:56.084 --> 01:57.501
I killed the last vampire.

01:57.502 --> 02:02.297
You may have killed Count Dracula,
but he was not the last.

02:02.298 --> 02:04.814
And there will be more.

02:04.815 --> 02:06.852
You do not have the Master's power...

02:06.853 --> 02:13.527
From the ashes and bone I devoured the
Master's skull and consumed his power.

02:13.826 --> 02:17.821
Now I... Am... The Master...

02:17.822 --> 02:21.539
I can't concentrate if you
keep mouthing my lines, Gerry.

02:21.778 --> 02:22.557
I'm not!

02:22.558 --> 02:24.336
Yeah... you are.

02:25.035 --> 02:26.193
Amateurs.

02:26.194 --> 02:32.087
But like I was saying... we
picture the house! It's 1912!

02:34.146 --> 02:37.102
Now that I have Dracula's power,

02:37.103 --> 02:41.877
I will turn you and your
family into vampires!

02:41.878 --> 02:45.833
A new legion of undead will rise!

02:45.834 --> 02:47.433
Never!

02:48.351 --> 02:49.950
Jonathan!

03:25.654 --> 03:27.971
And then the boy cries...

03:27.972 --> 03:28.690
Father!

03:28.691 --> 03:30.030
Quincy! No!

03:40.080 --> 03:43.637
He pulled me too hard. Again.

04:04.535 --> 04:06.394
The lights dim.

04:07.792 --> 04:09.429
The lights dim.

04:09.430 --> 04:12.808
Yeah. Got it... Got it.

04:14.206 --> 04:15.864
And big finish.

04:16.035 --> 04:19.539
Before he died, our
great-great grandfather,

04:19.540 --> 04:21.536
Jonathan Harker, told his son

04:21.538 --> 04:24.614
to burn the bones of the last vampire.

04:24.615 --> 04:28.550
But... the boy chose to keep one piece.

04:28.551 --> 04:31.407
The head of the monster.

04:31.408 --> 04:34.504
A skull of the first vampire.

04:34.505 --> 04:40.758
The power to turn others
and create a legion of vampires.

04:40.759 --> 04:45.833
A reminder of that fateful night
and to stay vigilant

04:45.834 --> 04:51.828
and if the forces of evil
should ever rise again.

04:51.868 --> 04:52.946
Shit.

04:52.947 --> 04:55.683
Applause... applause... applause!

04:55.684 --> 04:57.401
Mr. Harker...

04:57.402 --> 05:00.039
Call me Gerry. My dad was 'Mr. Harker.'

05:00.040 --> 05:02.238
Yes, and I am sorry for your...

05:02.657 --> 05:04.576
loss.

05:04.635 --> 05:07.751
But when the Leechwood
County Clerk's office

05:07.752 --> 05:12.007
granted you fifty thousand dollars
for property renovations...

05:12.008 --> 05:14.844
we never agreed to financing this...

05:14.845 --> 05:15.643
Masterpiece?

05:15.644 --> 05:20.558
It's a disaster piece!
Have you completely lost your mind?!

05:20.559 --> 05:23.339
That money was supposed
to make this home

05:23.340 --> 05:26.312
a safe and suitable
historical landmark!

05:26.313 --> 05:30.208
Not bankroll a god-awful
freak show about vampires!

05:30.209 --> 05:33.666
This house is a deathtrap!

05:34.945 --> 05:36.123
Broken glass.

05:36.124 --> 05:37.581
We're gonna fix that.

05:37.582 --> 05:40.338
What is this even attached to?!

05:40.339 --> 05:41.477
Zip ties.

05:41.478 --> 05:43.275
This actually looks pretty good.

05:43.276 --> 05:47.193
Well we did start the renovation!
Then Gerry came home.

05:47.612 --> 05:51.387
Why is there a wood-chipper
at the top of the stairs?!

05:51.388 --> 05:53.245
Do you see any wood up here?

05:53.246 --> 05:53.805
Really?!

05:53.806 --> 05:54.685
Props for the show.

05:54.686 --> 05:56.043
You're using real wooden stakes?

05:56.044 --> 05:57.161
Those aren't real.

05:57.162 --> 05:58.801
Wait, those are real?!

06:00.839 --> 06:03.495
Why are their spices in the fuse-box?

06:03.496 --> 06:05.475
I thought it was a spice rack.

06:06.454 --> 06:08.650
You can't latch the spice rack.

06:08.651 --> 06:12.027
A person could wander in off the streets
and find themselves on that stage.

06:12.028 --> 06:14.704
If the cable was pulled at the wrong
moment, they could step out

06:14.705 --> 06:17.681
without having any idea they're
about to be impaled in the throat!

06:17.682 --> 06:19.259
Way ahead of you, lady.

06:19.260 --> 06:21.977
Did it ever occur to you
that it could get stuck?!

06:21.978 --> 06:24.355
Trust me this thing is safe!

06:26.853 --> 06:27.951
Is everyone okay?

06:27.952 --> 06:29.070
You have one week.

06:29.071 --> 06:32.226
One week to finish renovations and we
won't sue for misappropriation of funds.

06:32.227 --> 06:32.947
About the money.

06:32.948 --> 06:35.004
I mean look at the detail
of that background!

06:35.005 --> 06:36.322
It's like he's really there!

06:36.323 --> 06:37.921
One week!

06:38.142 --> 06:39.739
And fix your damn door!

06:39.740 --> 06:40.958
Wait!

06:40.959 --> 06:43.096
You forgot your T-shirrrr...

06:43.996 --> 06:45.273
Got it!

06:45.274 --> 06:46.909
If you cannot
reimburse the fifty

06:46.910 --> 06:48.930
thousand, this property
will be condemned

06:48.931 --> 06:50.089
and seized by the state.

06:50.090 --> 06:53.365
And I'm afraid Leechwood
has very strict water usage hours.

06:53.366 --> 06:57.242
So I'll be sure to add this to the fine.
Good day, gentlemen.

06:57.762 --> 07:00.160
You forgot your free T-shirt!

07:25.054 --> 07:25.734
We blew it.

07:25.735 --> 07:27.171
I fucking nailed it, man!

07:27.172 --> 07:29.349
You can't break character!
Not in the middle of a scene.

07:29.350 --> 07:31.767
Well you're the big Hollywood actor.
You play the vampire!

07:31.768 --> 07:33.346
No, it has to be a
Harker who tells the

07:33.347 --> 07:35.123
story... and Charlie
does not want to do it!

07:35.124 --> 07:36.202
What about your sister then?

07:36.203 --> 07:38.400
No, Paige thinks this whole
thing is a bad idea.

07:38.401 --> 07:39.200
Yeah, well it is.

07:39.201 --> 07:41.357
Dammit. Charlie was so
proud of making these.

07:41.358 --> 07:44.449
That does it! You darn Harkers!
I warned ya

07:44.450 --> 07:47.471
about that damn dog
shitting in my yard...

07:47.472 --> 07:49.709
Mavis, that is not our dog!
I keep telling you that...

07:49.710 --> 07:53.965
You Harkers are all alike!
Making a mess of everything.

07:54.765 --> 07:55.764
For the record, I'm not a Harker.

07:55.765 --> 07:59.079
Whoa whoa whoa... Mavis!
Leave those boys alone.

07:59.080 --> 08:02.376
Shut your mouth, you old fart!

08:02.377 --> 08:06.314
Now you... clean it up!

08:08.771 --> 08:09.609
She didn't like the shirt?

08:09.610 --> 08:10.589
Nah, it's shit.

08:10.590 --> 08:12.506
Okay, from the top.

08:12.507 --> 08:14.804
No, no, no... I can't
be late for work again,

08:14.805 --> 08:17.201
because my manager will kill me, man,
because he's a psycho.

08:17.202 --> 08:20.638
Like a serial killer psycho, like I'm
gonna wake up in a trunk or something.

08:20.639 --> 08:23.115
But I don't give a shit!
Because he pays me.

08:23.116 --> 08:24.574
I don't even know why I help you guys.

08:24.575 --> 08:26.174
I'm back!

08:51.848 --> 08:54.364
Hey, Paige! Need any help with that?

08:54.365 --> 08:56.484
I'm good. Give Wayne a hand.

08:59.060 --> 09:00.939
Aww, dadgummit!

09:00.978 --> 09:03.575
Man... thank you, Charlie.

09:03.576 --> 09:05.713
When are you gonna end it
with that dick socket?

09:05.714 --> 09:06.573
Real classy, Ned.

09:06.574 --> 09:08.570
I told you before, I
do not trust that guy.

09:08.571 --> 09:11.527
You don't trust my fiance...
the Sheriff?

09:11.528 --> 09:13.427
Your brothers hate him.

09:13.786 --> 09:15.483
They're humoring him.

09:15.484 --> 09:17.421
So I take it you're not
coming to the wedding?

09:17.422 --> 09:21.737
Well, actually I'm making you a
special gift for the big day.

09:21.738 --> 09:23.755
It's not a wood carving, is it?

09:23.756 --> 09:27.191
Yeah it's a wood carving!
Gerry loved the one I made for him...

09:27.192 --> 09:28.470
where is it, by the way?

09:28.471 --> 09:29.929
It was... stolen.

09:29.930 --> 09:31.587
Hey, stolen?! Why didn't you tell me?!

09:31.588 --> 09:33.885
How'd it go with the County Clerk?

09:33.886 --> 09:37.001
Did she 'have a bloody good
time' at House Harker?

09:37.002 --> 09:39.319
Shut up, Wayne! It was awful...

09:39.320 --> 09:41.497
Awfully good. Awfully good.

09:41.498 --> 09:42.017
Really?!

09:42.018 --> 09:45.473
I told you, Paige. People want
to hear about our family.

09:45.474 --> 09:47.692
Well, hope you boys are hungry.

09:49.890 --> 09:50.927
Famished.

09:50.928 --> 09:52.466
I thought you were late for work.

09:52.467 --> 09:54.644
Hey! Wanna take a ride in the squad car?

09:54.645 --> 09:56.082
Get you there in a jiffy! Whoop-whoop!

09:56.083 --> 09:57.980
We all know you're
a big shot now, Wayne,

09:57.981 --> 09:59.419
but I don't need your charity.

09:59.420 --> 10:01.278
Okay... okay.

10:02.677 --> 10:05.773
Hey! It looks like all your wood
carvings are selling like hot cakes!

10:05.774 --> 10:07.373
All gone!

10:13.386 --> 10:15.443
Okay! Okay! Okay!

10:15.444 --> 10:17.043
Ha ha!

10:52.027 --> 10:52.587
You're late, Morris.

10:52.588 --> 10:57.880
Sorry, Kevin. I
lost track of time, pal.

10:57.881 --> 11:00.200
Funny... we lost track of time too.

11:00.599 --> 11:02.076
Playing with our new toy.

11:02.077 --> 11:05.974
It slices and dices up to
twenty-two carvings in minutes.

11:06.353 --> 11:07.452
What?!

11:07.532 --> 11:11.247
No... no... NO!!

11:11.248 --> 11:13.904
We put all of your carvings
in the wood chipper.

11:13.905 --> 11:17.141
No!!

11:17.142 --> 11:20.338
You're fired, Morris. This should
be easy enough to carry home.

11:20.339 --> 11:24.913
Two years... two years of work
in a goddamn wood chipper!

11:24.914 --> 11:26.074
Get out!

11:32.347 --> 11:32.786
Potato...

11:32.787 --> 11:33.486
Fingers.

11:33.487 --> 11:36.762
No, you have to say, 'french fries' or
my 'potato' sounds stupid, so... Potato!

11:36.763 --> 11:37.801
Open potato.

11:37.802 --> 11:38.800
Never mind.

11:38.801 --> 11:40.318
What the hell am I gonna do now, guys?!

11:40.319 --> 11:43.255
Wanna know what we're gonna do? Charlie,
can we fix the house in one week?

11:43.256 --> 11:43.895
No.

11:43.896 --> 11:46.752
Therefore our only shot is the show.

11:46.753 --> 11:49.149
The show? It's not gonna work, pal!

11:49.150 --> 11:50.967
People love vampire stuff!

11:50.968 --> 11:54.166
People love male models
that sparkle and pout.

11:54.425 --> 11:55.723
Gorgeous people.

11:55.724 --> 11:59.559
No one's scared of vampires anymore.
Thank those stupid Stacey Mendler books.

11:59.560 --> 12:03.355
The Nix County Necro has struck...
again.

12:03.356 --> 12:05.753
Law Enforcement are baffled
as they have discovered

12:05.754 --> 12:09.910
five defiled bodies in
the Nix County area.

12:09.969 --> 12:13.864
Sheriff's Deputy Denny Green reminds
us that 'even if he kills you...

12:13.865 --> 12:16.322
you're still not safe.'

12:16.323 --> 12:17.481
And in other news...

12:17.482 --> 12:20.298
We should show them the
real vampire skull!

12:20.299 --> 12:21.517
What real vampire skull?

12:21.518 --> 12:23.077
This is a bad idea.

12:25.394 --> 12:27.571
Alas, poor Yorick!

12:29.010 --> 12:32.406
This is a bad idea!

12:32.407 --> 12:33.826
No, mine!

12:36.782 --> 12:38.841
Stop it!

13:00.399 --> 13:01.998
Charlie?

13:14.245 --> 13:15.564
Keep em coming, Bart.

13:17.202 --> 13:18.560
Can we have another?

13:18.561 --> 13:19.360
We'll have another.

13:19.361 --> 13:22.356
What is with the fucking pencil?

13:22.357 --> 13:24.434
When we were kids, he used
to talk to the walls.

13:24.435 --> 13:26.004
One day my Dad hands
him the pencil and

13:26.005 --> 13:28.250
says, "Use this to get
out your feelings."

13:28.251 --> 13:29.489
He took it literally.

13:29.490 --> 13:30.707
Like Asperger's?

13:30.708 --> 13:31.667
Who's getting burgers?

13:31.668 --> 13:33.744
Hey, kid... what's in the bag, kid?

13:33.745 --> 13:35.423
Look, dude! It's your movie!

13:35.424 --> 13:36.701
Hey, kid!

13:36.702 --> 13:38.719
Leave me alone! I'm
just going to school!

13:38.720 --> 13:40.579
Leave me alone!

13:40.599 --> 13:45.153
"He was an outsider in a small town
with dreams of making it big."

13:45.154 --> 13:48.590
Your daddy was an accountant, dammit,
and you're gonna be one too!

13:48.591 --> 13:51.948
Your mother was right!
You're nothin' but an accountant!

13:52.027 --> 13:56.582
"Based on the true story of one
boy who defied the odds..."

13:56.583 --> 14:00.878
Twirl, baby. Twirl.

14:07.572 --> 14:11.128
"From the team who brought you...
Kazoo."

14:16.682 --> 14:18.839
"Twirl."

14:18.840 --> 14:21.821
What a piece of shit!

14:22.497 --> 14:24.454
They might not be your demographic.

14:24.455 --> 14:25.633
Hey, Gerry...

14:25.634 --> 14:27.850
Twirl, baby! Twirl!

14:27.851 --> 14:30.148
Let's go. Let's go.

14:30.149 --> 14:34.405
Aw, come on! I love when
you guys come in here!

14:34.445 --> 14:39.660
Once people find out you're here,
they show up just to mess with you.

14:39.859 --> 14:42.596
Gives me a ton of business!

14:47.871 --> 14:51.447
You guys know I spent like six fucking
months learning how to twirl that thing.

14:51.448 --> 14:53.165
I thought it was gonna be a good movie.

14:53.166 --> 14:55.822
It was supposed to be the 'Billy
Elliot' of baton twirling films.

14:55.823 --> 15:00.100
It was a great movie! Do you know
how many little boys you touched?

15:00.219 --> 15:01.816
Their lives!

15:01.817 --> 15:04.014
Why does everyone in this
town hate us so much?

15:04.015 --> 15:05.694
They don't hate us.

15:07.552 --> 15:10.469
What? What?!

15:12.407 --> 15:13.944
I can't even... talk to you right now.

15:13.945 --> 15:15.303
Come on, they're jealous!

15:15.304 --> 15:15.763
No!

15:15.764 --> 15:18.560
I'm awesome. You're awesome.
Your sister is hot!

15:18.561 --> 15:20.160
Wait, what?

15:20.658 --> 15:22.336
She's beautiful!

15:22.337 --> 15:24.094
Come on, Gerry!

15:24.095 --> 15:27.491
She's been this whole town's
spank bank since she grew tits!

15:27.492 --> 15:29.469
Are you...?! My God.

15:29.470 --> 15:32.066
She is! She's beautiful!
That's disgusting. That's disgusting.

15:32.067 --> 15:34.324
Like a sister, Charlie. Like a sister!

15:34.325 --> 15:35.064
That makes it worse!

15:35.065 --> 15:36.901
Twirling is something they can
never take away from you.

15:36.902 --> 15:38.480
Every single time you do
it, I get inspired...

15:38.481 --> 15:38.999
Charlie. Every single time
you do it, I get inspired...

15:39.000 --> 15:39.078
Charlie.

15:39.079 --> 15:40.857
I mean the last time I was
sad, I just put on the movie...

15:40.858 --> 15:41.151
Charlie... Charlie! I lied, okay?!
I mean the

15:41.152 --> 15:41.582
last time I was sad, I
just put on the movie...

15:41.583 --> 15:44.755
Charlie... Charlie! I lied, okay?!

15:46.165 --> 15:47.963
I never learned how to twirl.

15:48.882 --> 15:50.599
I tried... I tried...

15:50.600 --> 15:52.918
I just was too embarrassed to tell you.

15:53.297 --> 15:57.474
They hired a stunt-man, and
it was visual effects.

15:57.813 --> 15:59.472
Shit.

16:02.648 --> 16:04.447
Well now you've done it.

16:05.745 --> 16:09.880
The performance of your life!
That was amazing, Gerry! Wow.

16:09.881 --> 16:14.297
I believed him for a second there. He's
gonna be twirling till the day he dies!

16:14.596 --> 16:16.213
I'm going to watch every time.

16:16.214 --> 16:17.813
You fucker.

16:25.525 --> 16:27.184
Fuck, man!

16:30.101 --> 16:31.818
Did somebody leave the door open?

16:31.819 --> 16:32.717
Where's the fucking money?!

16:32.718 --> 16:33.596
Come on!

16:33.597 --> 16:34.516
Where's the fucking money?!

16:34.517 --> 16:36.114
You could not have picked
a worse day to rob us!

16:36.115 --> 16:38.671
You kidding me?! I saw the sign
outside, all this dusty old shit...

16:38.672 --> 16:39.870
I know this place is loaded!

16:39.871 --> 16:40.290
We're not...

16:40.291 --> 16:41.852
Don't lie to me, fucking
Dopey, I'll paint

16:41.853 --> 16:43.306
your brains all over
this fucking wall!

16:43.307 --> 16:44.206
Might have a few quarters!
My credit cards are all in...

16:44.207 --> 16:44.741
Shut the fuck up and sit the fuck down!
Might have

16:44.742 --> 16:45.224
a few quarters! My credit
cards are all in...

16:45.225 --> 16:48.582
Shut the fuck up and sit the fuck down!

16:52.498 --> 16:54.215
It's the Nix County Necro!

16:54.216 --> 16:56.315
He's gonna kill us then fuck us!

16:57.793 --> 16:58.752
What do we got here, boys?

16:58.753 --> 17:01.388
That's just an ordinary box!
There's nothing in that box...

17:01.389 --> 17:03.207
We keep our money... in a box with...

17:03.727 --> 17:05.326
Smoother edges.

17:06.404 --> 17:09.422
What the fuck is this?

17:09.981 --> 17:11.660
That thing is freaky.

17:14.836 --> 17:16.894
What the fuck is that?!

17:20.190 --> 17:23.747
Ooh-ho-ho-hoo... What do we got here?

17:24.107 --> 17:25.864
There's a sign, pal.

17:25.865 --> 17:29.581
This sign? The 'do not pull' sign?!

17:29.702 --> 17:33.416
What, are you running some kind of
freaky-deeky kinky sex show here?!

17:33.417 --> 17:36.293
It's a family show! It's sort
of a tourist attraction!

17:36.294 --> 17:37.572
Bout what?

17:37.573 --> 17:39.692
Vampires.

17:39.731 --> 17:42.987
Vampires?
What, are you guys con artists?

17:42.988 --> 17:45.244
You dupe people to come in here
and believe this dogshit?!

17:45.245 --> 17:48.301
Hey! You cannot just come in here
and make fun of their beliefs.

17:48.302 --> 17:49.580
No, Ned, it's okay.

17:49.581 --> 17:52.738
I got this!
Now I may not believe in this...

17:53.018 --> 17:56.373
a person could wander in off the streets
and find themselves on that stage...

17:56.374 --> 17:58.831
if the cable was pulled at the wrong
moment, they could step out

17:58.832 --> 18:01.648
without having any idea they're
about to be impaled in the...

18:01.649 --> 18:03.646
Shhh! Now I may not believe
in this vampire stuff...

18:03.647 --> 18:05.124
I said shut the fuck up.
But these assholes do...

18:05.125 --> 18:06.681
and they are my assholes!

18:06.681 --> 18:10.252
I said... shut the fuck up!

18:13.857 --> 18:17.912
No, no, no!
Don't pull it! Leave it in! Leave it in!

18:27.523 --> 18:29.062
You okay, pal?

18:37.933 --> 18:39.051
That could've been me!!

18:39.052 --> 18:40.969
We're in trouble!
Dad was right! It is dangerous!

18:40.970 --> 18:43.926
I'm pretty sure it was cause that
fuckhead yanked on the cable!

18:43.927 --> 18:45.844
There is a sign!

18:45.845 --> 18:48.022
Whoa, what're you doing, man?!
We can't call the cops!

18:48.023 --> 18:48.722
But Wayne!

18:48.723 --> 18:50.897
Sure, he'll bail you
two out, but he knows

18:50.898 --> 18:52.957
I'm his only
competition for Paige!

18:52.958 --> 18:56.313
I'm not spending the next five years
getting my turd-cutter tongue punched

18:56.314 --> 18:59.590
by a cellmate named daddy
with a straw doll collection!

18:59.591 --> 19:02.827
You guys, this was not our fault!
It was an accident!

19:02.828 --> 19:04.745
Actually, the official
citation from the County Clerk

19:04.746 --> 19:06.743
did say something like
this could happen.

19:06.744 --> 19:08.022
Something like this did happen!

19:08.023 --> 19:10.380
Could this day get any worse?!

19:33.837 --> 19:36.873
Dude, we can't use paper towels...
there is blood everywhere!

19:36.874 --> 19:37.792
Well, what then?!

19:37.793 --> 19:39.092
Got it!

19:42.688 --> 19:45.784
Charlie! Get something to wrap him in
and I'll pull around the car!

19:45.785 --> 19:46.883
Vacuum, Ned.

19:46.884 --> 19:48.463
Aw, man.

20:14.936 --> 20:18.173
Come on. Come on!

20:20.330 --> 20:22.108
Yes!

20:24.466 --> 20:25.365
Walter!

20:25.366 --> 20:28.461
Those Harkers are up to something...
I know it!

20:28.462 --> 20:31.260
Dammit, Mavis! Leave them boys be.

20:32.398 --> 20:36.654
Get over there now
or I'll smother you in your sleep!

20:36.894 --> 20:38.493
You would.

20:44.206 --> 20:45.664
Whoa.

20:45.665 --> 20:48.121
It looks pretty damn clean in here.
Good work.

20:48.122 --> 20:49.580
Well, you know.

20:49.581 --> 20:51.240
Let's turn him over!

20:54.056 --> 20:55.894
I didn't know rigor
mortis set in so fast.

20:55.895 --> 20:56.654
It doesn't.

20:56.655 --> 20:58.671
Well he was on a lot of drugs.

20:58.672 --> 21:01.288
Man, if you could show
this to kids, and say look...

21:01.289 --> 21:02.888
Look what can happen!

21:03.427 --> 21:05.044
Hey, hey, Walter!

21:05.045 --> 21:09.260
Sorry to bother you, but you know
that soul-sucking succubus of a wife...?

21:09.261 --> 21:12.397
She literally threatened to kill me
if I didn't come over and find out

21:12.398 --> 21:14.175
what's going on with all the ruckus.

21:14.176 --> 21:15.933
Just sprucing the place up.

21:15.934 --> 21:17.741
You know I heard about what happened.

21:17.933 --> 21:19.090
Yeah. The County Clerk.

21:19.091 --> 21:20.549
Yeah! Yeah, yeah...

21:20.550 --> 21:21.768
You need any help?

21:21.769 --> 21:23.488
No, no, no... we're fine.

21:24.626 --> 21:27.202
That's a damn shame about
your father's passing.

21:27.203 --> 21:30.379
He did such a fine job of
raising you kiddos on his own.

21:30.380 --> 21:33.098
I never knew your mother,
but she was a...

21:35.295 --> 21:37.094
handsome woman.

21:38.132 --> 21:39.610
Yeah.

21:39.611 --> 21:41.208
How you boys holding up?

21:41.209 --> 21:42.427
We're fine!

21:42.428 --> 21:46.924
Well... if you need anything,
I'll probably be murdered by my wife.

21:47.403 --> 21:49.002
Goodnight.

21:50.340 --> 21:51.398
Ned.

21:51.399 --> 21:52.998
Walter.

22:24.706 --> 22:27.562
Let's dump it right here. Come on.

22:37.952 --> 22:39.631
Where do you think it goes?

22:40.630 --> 22:42.567
Probably Lake Superior.

22:42.768 --> 22:43.727
This isn't going to work.

22:43.728 --> 22:46.203
Charlie... it's gonna work!

22:46.204 --> 22:49.222
I saw it on an episode
of Unsolved Mysteries.

22:50.540 --> 22:52.017
Hello...

22:52.018 --> 22:53.957
'Unsolved.'

22:54.436 --> 22:57.632
At least we know the body is
gonna be far away from here. Come on.

23:13.916 --> 23:15.815
Hey, Kip?

23:16.014 --> 23:17.713
Yeah, Denny?

23:20.610 --> 23:22.367
Found a body.

23:29.661 --> 23:31.839
You guys are up early.

23:31.898 --> 23:34.655
Or you never went to bed.
Long night?

23:34.656 --> 23:37.492
How... how... how was your night?

23:37.493 --> 23:39.931
It was... fine.

23:39.990 --> 23:42.527
We just... watched TV.
Cuddled on the couch.

23:42.528 --> 23:45.865
Twirl was on, so we watched
my brother the superstar.

23:46.863 --> 23:48.941
Heard you boys got into
some trouble last night.

23:51.139 --> 23:52.737
Hey! Hey, hey...

23:52.738 --> 23:55.434
Those boneheads at the
tavern giving you guys guff?

23:55.435 --> 23:58.830
Look, what they don't
understand is that.

23:58.831 --> 24:02.846
Twirl is like the 'October
Sky' of baton twirling movies.

24:02.847 --> 24:04.844
All right? Cheer up.

24:04.845 --> 24:07.442
Hey, Sheriff?
You're gonna want to come and see this.

24:07.443 --> 24:08.641
Copy.

24:08.642 --> 24:09.341
I gotta go, babe.

24:09.342 --> 24:12.219
Okay... see you later. Bye.
I know, sorry.

24:12.518 --> 24:14.936
All right! See you guys!

24:16.614 --> 24:19.849
Well I'm off to go yawn a
big bright chunky rainbow.

24:19.850 --> 24:21.849
I'm gonna... pay the...

24:23.158 --> 24:24.057
What's going on?

24:24.058 --> 24:24.816
Nothing.

24:24.817 --> 24:27.355
What are you not telling me?

24:30.791 --> 24:32.390
No.

24:36.465 --> 24:39.742
You're okay. You just had a little fall.

24:43.718 --> 24:46.194
He's fine... he just rolled off...

24:46.195 --> 24:49.072
I don't know. Looks
pretty scuffed up to me.

24:49.073 --> 24:50.690
Maybe I should just use yours?

24:50.691 --> 24:52.228
No... that's... I...

24:52.229 --> 24:55.247
That's...
Spit it out, special ed!

24:56.066 --> 24:57.123
Nothing?

24:57.124 --> 24:59.422
Well maybe I will use your pencil then.

25:00.741 --> 25:03.297
No! No, please don't... give it back!

25:03.298 --> 25:06.934
No? Don't give you the pencil back?!
Okay, I'll keep it then!

25:06.935 --> 25:09.052
Hey, dipshit's pencil. I'm Chad.

25:09.053 --> 25:11.369
And I'm gonna pay my bill with you
and then snap you in half

25:11.370 --> 25:14.506
to teach your special friend here that
you're just an inanimate fucking pencil!

25:14.507 --> 25:16.106
Chad Cheever?

25:17.005 --> 25:19.401
Quarterback for the
Leechwood Devils...?!

25:19.402 --> 25:20.381
Sup, Paige?

25:20.382 --> 25:22.518
How'd a chick like you wind
up in a family with him?

25:22.519 --> 25:24.116
He's not so bad.

25:24.117 --> 25:27.115
He's got his strengths...
not unlike yourself.

25:27.394 --> 25:29.473
Yeah you're not so bad yourself.

25:30.191 --> 25:33.447
I'm sure we can find something much
better to do with these hands of yours,

25:33.448 --> 25:35.087
don't you think?

25:35.106 --> 25:38.222
What'd you have in mind? Wouldn't
want to piss off the town Sheriff...

25:38.223 --> 25:40.262
That shouldn't be a problem for you.

25:40.841 --> 25:42.859
You're all muscle, right?

25:43.858 --> 25:45.335
And not much else.

25:45.336 --> 25:46.015
What?

25:46.016 --> 25:48.512
You see, Chad... I need
the whole package.

25:48.513 --> 25:53.049
And the word around town is that you
don't have much of a package at all.

25:53.489 --> 25:57.465
So unfortunately for you, it's a...
small town.

25:57.904 --> 25:59.421
What did you say, bitch?!

25:59.422 --> 26:00.760
What did you say to me?!

26:00.761 --> 26:02.258
Your family is such a freakshow!

26:02.259 --> 26:04.216
Hey, you don't know the first
thing about my family, asshole!

26:04.217 --> 26:04.997
Yeah?

26:04.998 --> 26:07.593
Retard... Faggot... and the
princess who thinks she's better

26:07.594 --> 26:10.191
because she happens to be mildly hot!

26:11.210 --> 26:12.248
What is wrong with you people?

26:12.249 --> 26:13.447
Fuck you, Chad!

26:13.448 --> 26:15.366
I might if you ask nicely.

26:18.482 --> 26:20.081
Chad Cheever!

26:21.599 --> 26:23.198
Go Devils!

26:25.136 --> 26:26.593
We're going to State!

26:26.594 --> 26:27.972
God, will you let go of me!?

26:27.973 --> 26:29.990
If I do, will you calm down?

26:29.991 --> 26:31.448
Let's just go.

26:31.449 --> 26:33.947
I can take care of myself.

26:35.485 --> 26:36.963
No you can't, Charlie!

26:36.964 --> 26:38.381
Are you kidding me?

26:38.382 --> 26:40.100
Then I should've just let
them break the pencil

26:40.101 --> 26:42.479
cause then you'd stop
acting like such a...

26:49.831 --> 26:53.248
Say it again! Say it again!

26:53.927 --> 26:55.524
What was I supposed to do?

26:55.525 --> 26:57.302
It's not like Charlie could
do anything about it.

26:57.303 --> 26:59.580
Yes he can, Paige.

26:59.581 --> 27:01.518
You just have to let him try.

27:01.519 --> 27:05.435
I'm the only girl in the world
who has to protect her big brother.

27:07.793 --> 27:09.230
He'll surprise you someday.

27:09.231 --> 27:12.389
Until he does... you better plan on
picking me up from detention.

27:12.428 --> 27:13.648
Every day.

27:17.223 --> 27:20.521
I'm sorry. Charlie, I'm
sorry, I didn't mean...

27:22.338 --> 27:23.937
Charlie!

27:29.891 --> 27:32.129
I feel like I missed something.

27:36.005 --> 27:37.182
Grabeste-Te!

27:37.183 --> 27:39.781
Unde îl îngropam?

27:40.300 --> 27:42.177
Bury?!

27:42.178 --> 27:45.156
No, this traitor we
feed to the wild dogs.

27:48.326 --> 27:52.868
Hahaha! Look! Haha!
Dog is hungry!

27:53.387 --> 27:55.626
Be bones by morning.

27:55.805 --> 27:59.362
Hahaha!

27:59.501 --> 28:04.036
Hey, doggy doggy... you hungry, doggy?

28:04.037 --> 28:08.193
Come on little doggy... time to eat...

28:12.628 --> 28:15.784
Tu Dracul! Strigoi!

28:21.559 --> 28:24.755
Whoa!...what is... that?!

28:24.756 --> 28:27.632
We've ID'ed him. It's that
killer who's been on the loose.

28:27.633 --> 28:31.088
He was just spotted less than
twelve hours ago outside of Leechwood.

28:31.089 --> 28:35.144
Decay around the lacerations show he's
only been dead a couple of hours.

28:35.145 --> 28:36.844
It's his blood...

28:37.004 --> 28:38.042
it's gone.

28:38.043 --> 28:38.862
What do you mean gone?

28:38.863 --> 28:41.558
Completely! Like something
just sucked it out of him!

28:41.559 --> 28:42.797
Like something came along and...

28:42.798 --> 28:44.795
All right, let me stop you
right there, okay, Gil?

28:44.796 --> 28:47.252
It's that kind of talk that causes
pandemonium in this town.

28:47.253 --> 28:50.509
The legends, the stories...
they really freak folks out. All right?

28:50.510 --> 28:53.286
Boys? Mums the word.
Let's keep your lips sealed.

28:53.287 --> 28:55.184
Right, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:55.185 --> 28:56.983
You too, Gil. Okay?

28:56.984 --> 29:00.188
Okay? Got it?

29:04.516 --> 29:05.854
Everything okay, Doc?

29:05.855 --> 29:06.754
Yeah, yeah... I'm fine.

29:06.755 --> 29:10.249
Hey, everyone knows about
the body they found this morning.

29:10.250 --> 29:11.768
I can't talk about it.

29:11.769 --> 29:12.608
Time to take the edge off?

29:12.609 --> 29:16.363
No, no... I'm sober now.
I've been through the 12-Step program...

29:16.364 --> 29:20.401
And here's to step 13.

29:25.656 --> 29:27.892
Something just chewed up his neck!

29:27.893 --> 29:30.109
I've seen animal attacks and this...

29:30.131 --> 29:34.160
No blood... and bitten right here!

29:35.425 --> 29:40.839
It was probably a drive-by! You know,
like one of those gang-bang thingies!

29:40.840 --> 29:42.677
If you're scared I can protect you.

29:42.678 --> 29:45.074
No thanks! Vampires are hot!

29:45.075 --> 29:46.853
Chad, I'm saving myself.

29:46.854 --> 29:50.269
Babe, it's vampires.
We gotta repopulate the Earth.

29:50.270 --> 29:52.947
How many people constitute a mob?

29:55.045 --> 29:57.682
Calm down! Calm down! Calm down!

29:57.683 --> 29:59.474
I'm hearing a lot of rumors...

29:59.474 --> 30:02.317
and any such talk of vampires,
well that's just plain silly!

30:02.318 --> 30:06.654
If there were vampires, those Harkers
would've said something about it, right?

30:08.232 --> 30:10.291
Dadgummit, Denny.

30:16.764 --> 30:18.442
Guys?

30:22.438 --> 30:23.876
Where do they come from?!
Have they been here the whole time?!

30:23.877 --> 30:26.654
How do we stop them?!
What are they, terrorists?

30:27.113 --> 30:30.309
You know, the body the
cops found this morning!

30:30.310 --> 30:31.388
Awful. Tragic.

30:31.389 --> 30:32.647
Always use the buddy system.

30:32.648 --> 30:34.605
Okay, guys! Guys! Please disperse!

30:34.606 --> 30:37.002
Everyone go home...
there's nothing to see here, okay?

30:37.003 --> 30:38.741
These guys don't know shit.

30:41.179 --> 30:42.397
Guys, I am so so sorry.

30:42.398 --> 30:43.556
I don't even know what's going on!

30:43.557 --> 30:45.914
It's okay, honey. We just found
a dead body this morning...

30:45.915 --> 30:49.070
neck was mangled, blood was
drained, had fang marks...

30:49.071 --> 30:50.449
People just get a little paranoid.

30:50.450 --> 30:52.907
See, this is why I was worried
about the whole show thing.

30:52.908 --> 30:56.763
Yeah, of course, vampires!

30:56.764 --> 31:00.159
We know a lot about vampires!

31:00.160 --> 31:02.137
We were just... hey... come back!

31:02.138 --> 31:04.215
Solid, solid police work, Wayne.

31:04.216 --> 31:06.493
Send the whole town over
here to terrorize us!

31:06.494 --> 31:07.212
Good job, pal!

31:07.213 --> 31:08.092
Hey, Ned!

31:08.093 --> 31:12.227
No, no, honey. I am so sorry,
this is completely my fault.

31:12.228 --> 31:14.705
They just hear the word...

31:14.706 --> 31:18.143
and they think of your family.
Let's get inside.

31:25.515 --> 31:27.412
Wayne!
I can't believe I didn't think of it!

31:27.413 --> 31:28.771
How were we supposed to know?

31:28.772 --> 31:32.107
We dumped a dead body with a mutilated
neck drained of blood in the lake!

31:32.108 --> 31:33.806
Well when you say it like that...

31:33.807 --> 31:35.644
I knew it!

31:35.645 --> 31:36.484
Have you been here the...?

31:36.485 --> 31:39.180
The whole time, you sickos!

31:39.181 --> 31:41.378
Mavis, put down the gun! Please!

31:41.379 --> 31:44.894
This here gun is for my protection...
you murderers!

31:44.895 --> 31:47.991
I saw you the other night out my window.

31:47.992 --> 31:49.510
That? We were just...

31:49.511 --> 31:52.827
Get back in here and shut the fuck up!

31:52.828 --> 31:57.162
I know what you did,
I saw it with my own eyes!

31:57.163 --> 31:58.042
Mavis!

31:58.043 --> 31:59.340
Get over there! Both of you!

31:59.341 --> 32:00.300
They're good boys, just like their
daddy. Get over there! Both of you!

32:00.301 --> 32:01.738
They're good boys,
just like their daddy.

32:01.739 --> 32:06.872
These 'good' boys murdered that man
in cold blood and dumped his body!

32:06.873 --> 32:08.870
Mavis, please...

32:08.871 --> 32:12.787
You can all rot in hell...
the whole bunch of ya!

32:12.788 --> 32:14.125
I've had it!

32:14.126 --> 32:19.580
I'm turning you in...
and you Harkers will be done!

32:19.581 --> 32:24.616
You're finished! You're...

32:27.693 --> 32:29.332
Mavis?!

32:34.146 --> 32:35.745
She's dead.

32:36.004 --> 32:38.582
Why does this keep happening?!

32:41.779 --> 32:43.418
Boys...?

32:43.856 --> 32:45.495
We gotta talk.

32:48.072 --> 32:49.590
Well?
I think I'm gonna throw up.

32:49.591 --> 32:51.408
That's the craziest
idea I've ever heard.

32:51.409 --> 32:52.087
Definitely.

32:52.088 --> 32:53.006
I admire his candor.

32:53.007 --> 32:53.865
It would work.

32:53.866 --> 32:54.606
He's right.

32:54.607 --> 32:57.702
Guys, everyone in this town
hates us... we know that.

32:57.703 --> 32:59.600
But for a brief moment, they didn't.

32:59.601 --> 33:01.358
They were interested
in what we had to say.

33:01.359 --> 33:02.896
Which was nothing, apparently.

33:02.897 --> 33:04.455
But what if they did
believe in vampires?!

33:04.456 --> 33:05.095
Exactly.

33:05.096 --> 33:06.713
You don't even believe in vampires.

33:06.714 --> 33:07.792
You're right, I don't.

33:07.793 --> 33:10.629
But I believe people pay
good money to feel safe

33:10.630 --> 33:12.747
and I sure as hell know you
do not want to lose our house!

33:12.748 --> 33:13.367
Charlie?

33:13.368 --> 33:14.745
The probability of your plan's success

33:14.746 --> 33:17.262
isn't high enough to warrant
the desecration of your wife's body.

33:17.263 --> 33:18.461
She tried to kill us, dude!

33:18.462 --> 33:19.981
That's true.

33:21.938 --> 33:23.477
Work shed.

33:33.986 --> 33:34.785
Okay.

33:34.786 --> 33:36.323
I'm not gonna do it! You do it!

33:36.324 --> 33:37.642
You carve things all the time...

33:37.643 --> 33:40.241
I don't carve people with my chainsaw!

33:40.620 --> 33:43.497
I'd love to help you, but...
might get messy.

33:44.696 --> 33:46.295
Help.

33:46.714 --> 33:49.571
Now don't hesitate.
We don't want it to bind up.

33:59.820 --> 34:02.118
It's in my mouth!

34:04.076 --> 34:06.653
Gerry, why are we doing this?!

34:06.654 --> 34:08.411
It's a bad idea!

34:14.945 --> 34:16.724
One down!

34:29.190 --> 34:31.909
Yeah, that'll do it.

34:33.206 --> 34:34.906
Good job, buddy.

34:35.085 --> 34:36.984
I'll get the Shop Vac.

34:37.782 --> 34:40.960
All right, boys.
Here's the plan...

34:41.139 --> 34:44.415
After we lay her outside, I'll draw as
much attention as possible.

34:44.416 --> 34:48.130
You boys go out to the forest
and make yourselves dirty.

34:48.132 --> 34:51.248
I'll call 911 to set things in motion.

34:51.248 --> 34:54.525
And in less than 10 minutes
the news will show up.

34:54.525 --> 34:57.402
So once you see the lights...
make your way back.

34:57.403 --> 34:58.980
Can you tell us what
happened here tonight?

34:58.981 --> 35:02.598
It was a vampire!

35:04.775 --> 35:07.012
Don't worry... I'll make
believers out of all of them.

35:07.013 --> 35:10.369
Those were the ones who saved me!

35:11.449 --> 35:14.944
What was it? What was it?

35:14.945 --> 35:16.083
We chased it!

35:16.084 --> 35:17.043
We staked it!

35:17.044 --> 35:18.501
It got away.

35:18.502 --> 35:20.039
Vampires in Leechwood?

35:20.040 --> 35:22.257
You expect us to believe
this was a real vampire?!

35:22.258 --> 35:24.515
Of course it was a vampire!

35:24.516 --> 35:27.772
We could be dealing with a maniac
on the loose! Where's your proof?

35:29.531 --> 35:32.806
Fine! Fine! You want proof?!
We'll capture it...

35:32.807 --> 35:34.225
and we'll show it to you!

35:34.226 --> 35:37.821
Okay? We're gonna catch the vampire and
you can all see for yourselves! Okay?

35:37.822 --> 35:41.357
Right here! At House Harker! All right?!

35:41.358 --> 35:44.044
You heard it here first, ladies...

35:44.176 --> 35:45.973
Well that wasn't exactly
in the script, Gerry.

35:45.974 --> 35:47.639
It's beginning to feel
now like we drilled

35:47.640 --> 35:49.190
a hole in my wife's
neck for no reason!

35:49.191 --> 35:51.568
I know! I'm sorry... I'm sorry!
I panicked!

35:51.569 --> 35:53.885
Prove it... How are we
going to prove it, Gerry?!

35:53.886 --> 35:56.974
We show them the real vampire skull.

35:56.975 --> 36:00.706
- Where's the real vampire skull?
- I'm sorry, Gerry. We hid it.

36:00.707 --> 36:03.215
From me? Why?!

36:03.216 --> 36:04.853
We're going to lose the house, Charlie!

36:04.854 --> 36:06.791
We had to. I'm sorry.

36:06.792 --> 36:08.769
Your father said that
the skull was cursed.

36:08.770 --> 36:09.769
Wait, you've seen it?

36:09.770 --> 36:13.145
Yeah. I'm no stranger to
the forces of darkness, fellas.

36:13.146 --> 36:16.801
I mean when I first met your pops...
I was still a Priest.

36:16.802 --> 36:20.018
Where do you think I learned on
how to handle the situation with Mavis?

36:20.019 --> 36:23.594
I mean, misdirection of information
is the church's specialty.

36:23.595 --> 36:25.073
Makes sense.

36:25.074 --> 36:26.651
I mean it was ages ago.

36:26.652 --> 36:30.489
But I used to handle exorcisms,
demonic possessions... you name it!

36:46.222 --> 36:50.268
Our Father, who art in Heaven...

36:50.269 --> 36:53.686
NuqDaq-OH puchpa-e.

36:55.224 --> 36:57.534
The power of Christ compels you!

36:57.829 --> 36:59.939
The power of Christ compels you!

37:00.298 --> 37:03.682
The power of Christ compels you!

37:12.546 --> 37:13.764
Fuck you!

37:13.765 --> 37:15.523
The power of Christ...

37:17.921 --> 37:19.599
Not so bad.

37:24.494 --> 37:28.130
You fucking moron!

37:28.930 --> 37:32.307
I cast you out, in the name of...

37:32.606 --> 37:34.845
Jesus Christ!

37:37.002 --> 37:39.740
Yeah... yeah...

37:39.879 --> 37:42.457
Can I get you something to drink?

37:44.994 --> 37:46.332
Really?!

37:46.333 --> 37:52.226
I have seen some stupid
fucking imbeciles, but...

37:52.227 --> 37:55.243
you are the worst!

37:55.244 --> 37:59.239
A person can only be yelled at
and puked on so many times

37:59.240 --> 38:01.698
by the spawn of Satan.

38:02.456 --> 38:06.053
I guess you could say... I just lost it.

38:06.872 --> 38:11.067
I had left the Priesthood.
I was lost. But then...

38:11.567 --> 38:14.543
Watch where you're going,
you pecker-head!

38:14.544 --> 38:16.202
You damn near killed me!

38:16.203 --> 38:21.258
Why, I've met some morons in my day...
pick up my damn groceries!

38:21.258 --> 38:24.855
I'd spent my entire life
getting yelled at by demons.

38:24.974 --> 38:27.011
I guess I sort of missed it.

38:27.012 --> 38:29.728
What the hell are you looking at?!

38:29.729 --> 38:32.246
Man... your breath smells!

38:32.247 --> 38:34.463
Your hair looks like a dog cut it!

38:34.464 --> 38:37.061
I couldn't even stand looking
at you everyday of my life...

38:37.062 --> 38:39.578
I'd shoot myself in the face.

38:39.579 --> 38:42.775
Golly... I would never want to
be a part of your life!

38:42.776 --> 38:44.622
All those years we were
together, I figured

38:44.623 --> 38:47.071
she was just probably
possessed by a demon.

38:48.330 --> 38:50.327
Sorry to interrupt story-time.

38:50.328 --> 38:51.486
Hey!

38:51.487 --> 38:53.086
Gerry, can I have a word?

38:54.245 --> 38:55.844
Sure.

38:58.960 --> 39:00.158
What were you thinking?

39:00.159 --> 39:01.796
No such thing as bad publicity?

39:01.797 --> 39:03.015
This isn't a movie, Gerry...
It's our lives!

39:03.016 --> 39:04.554
This isn't a
movie, Gerry... It's our lives!

39:05.273 --> 39:06.872
Hang on.

39:13.745 --> 39:15.523
Shut-up!

39:20.558 --> 39:22.477
She seems pretty miffed!

39:23.555 --> 39:25.432
That is a nice one.

39:25.433 --> 39:26.872
That is...

39:28.570 --> 39:31.546
Hey, I was thinking that maybe you and
I could...

39:31.547 --> 39:32.986
have a little talk.

39:35.024 --> 39:36.583
It's just...

39:38.960 --> 39:41.097
I saw you that one time...

39:41.098 --> 39:43.894
she, she said that one...

39:46.832 --> 39:50.188
I'm gonna go check on Charlie. Okay?

39:50.189 --> 39:51.901
All right, good.

39:57.761 --> 40:00.377
It's bad enough that you
dragged Charlie into this sideshow,

40:00.378 --> 40:02.515
now you've got the evening news
waving a camera in his face!

40:02.516 --> 40:03.994
He's fine.

40:03.995 --> 40:05.472
You saw what happened at the diner.

40:05.473 --> 40:08.351
He still believes all the crazy stories.

40:08.370 --> 40:10.387
Everything Dad ever told him.

40:10.388 --> 40:13.085
All I'm trying to do
is give this shithole

40:13.086 --> 40:15.282
of a town a reason
to believe him.

40:15.283 --> 40:17.562
Would they pick on him then?

40:17.581 --> 40:19.558
No.

40:19.559 --> 40:22.415
They'd be sorry they
messed with the Harkers.

40:22.416 --> 40:23.696
Right?

40:26.282 --> 40:28.189
You always do this.

40:28.190 --> 40:30.327
You always make me feel like
you know what you're doing.

40:30.328 --> 40:33.386
And that's how I got my first part.

40:37.541 --> 40:39.318
I have an idea!

40:39.319 --> 40:40.557
We kill Wayne!

40:40.558 --> 40:44.213
No! Proof?! They want proof...

40:44.214 --> 40:45.813
Hey...

40:46.172 --> 40:47.370
We hire an actor.

40:47.371 --> 40:48.489
All right I'll do it.

40:48.490 --> 40:49.588
Not you. Who?

40:49.589 --> 40:51.166
He played my coach in Twirl.

40:51.167 --> 40:53.624
He's kind of an arrogant
asshole, but he was good.

40:53.625 --> 40:56.821
Like, really good. Like Daniel-Day
Lewis level of commitment.

40:56.822 --> 40:57.681
Go on.

40:57.682 --> 41:00.757
People are coming here on
Friday night looking for a show.

41:00.758 --> 41:02.835
We give them a show!

41:02.836 --> 41:05.252
And then we swoop in and save the day!

41:05.253 --> 41:06.093
The probability of...

41:06.094 --> 41:10.229
What choice do we have?
This is our Hail Mary pass!

41:10.288 --> 41:11.887
Amen!

41:11.907 --> 41:14.923
We are thrilled to welcome
Stacey Mendler...

41:14.924 --> 41:18.559
best-selling author of the
'Succulent' book series.

41:18.560 --> 41:22.755
Now, Ms. Mendler, you've captivated
millions by taking this violent,

41:22.756 --> 41:28.389
horrific monster and turning it into
a sensitive, sexy, sparkling hero.

41:28.390 --> 41:31.226
What inspired you to
reinvent this creature?

41:31.227 --> 41:33.226
Okay, well first of
all, they're not

41:33.227 --> 41:35.822
creatures... they're just
misunderstood people.

41:35.823 --> 41:39.298
I mean someone had to tell
their side of the story.

41:39.299 --> 41:41.057
I've just brought the humanity back.

41:41.058 --> 41:44.312
As you may have heard, we
recently made national

41:44.313 --> 41:47.170
news with two alleged
'vampire attacks'...

41:47.171 --> 41:49.548
But this behavior is in
stark contrast to the

41:49.549 --> 41:53.104
misunderstood and loving
people that you write about.

41:53.105 --> 41:54.623
Would you care to comment?

41:54.624 --> 41:55.802
Let me be clear.

41:55.803 --> 41:58.959
Whoever is staging this hoax
are low-down con artists

41:58.960 --> 42:00.597
looking to make a quick buck.

42:00.598 --> 42:03.814
This insensitivity and, I'm
sorry, flat out racism

42:03.815 --> 42:05.792
towards vampires is sickening.

42:05.793 --> 42:07.530
I've got news for them...

42:07.531 --> 42:10.727
My book tour was never
coming to Leechwood.

42:10.728 --> 42:12.327
Now it is.

42:20.638 --> 42:21.736
So you'll do it?

42:21.737 --> 42:23.734
A thousand bucks. Non-negotiable.

42:23.735 --> 42:24.753
Eight-hundred.

42:24.754 --> 42:25.792
Done.

42:25.793 --> 42:26.991
I'm sure it'll be worth it!

42:26.992 --> 42:29.808
Are you kidding me? After I
transform, I'll be the character.

42:29.809 --> 42:32.545
The make-up, the hair... I'll be the
scariest thing you've ever seen.

42:32.546 --> 42:35.983
Thanks again, Tanner! So
good to catch up after...

42:40.778 --> 42:42.636
You got eight hundred bucks?

43:03.515 --> 43:04.254
What d'ya think?!

43:04.255 --> 43:05.952
Sup, Nedward Scissorhands?

43:05.953 --> 43:06.952
Fuck off, Gerry.

43:06.953 --> 43:09.348
If we are gonna be vampire hunters...
we are gonna look good.

43:09.349 --> 43:11.388
I forgot the best part!

43:15.603 --> 43:16.661
How kickass is that?!

43:16.662 --> 43:18.259
Will that even work?

43:18.260 --> 43:21.757
It'll work.
Made something for you too, pal.

43:22.336 --> 43:24.035
It's a baton!

43:24.154 --> 43:25.632
Made out of wood!

43:25.633 --> 43:27.870
'Twirl, baby. Twirl.'

43:27.871 --> 43:28.989
Thanks, man?

43:28.990 --> 43:31.426
Come on!
You guys are not ruining this for me!

43:31.427 --> 43:34.684
I wore that stupid vampire
costume for your show!

43:35.063 --> 43:37.242
Your turn.

43:38.780 --> 43:41.236
I feel like the Robin
Hood of fetish porn.

43:41.237 --> 43:44.173
Vampires beware!

43:44.174 --> 43:46.251
You guys look like a bunch of dweebs.

43:46.252 --> 43:48.289
How are we on the live stream?

43:48.290 --> 43:50.327
You really think we can get
enough viewers to make any money?

43:50.328 --> 43:53.964
Even if we monetize, it's gonna take
millions of views. How many we got?

43:53.965 --> 43:55.382
Currently...? Four.

43:55.383 --> 43:56.982
All right.

43:59.319 --> 44:01.358
What's this bullshit?

44:01.856 --> 44:04.648
I need you on the door, Paige!

44:04.881 --> 44:07.225
- What are you doing?
- It looks like a haunted house!

44:07.225 --> 44:09.305
It looks like we have
painters coming over.

44:09.305 --> 44:11.323
Have you seen our budget?

44:13.825 --> 44:15.444
You guys look...

44:16.202 --> 44:18.161
unbelievable!

44:18.360 --> 44:19.959
I told you!

44:20.478 --> 44:22.015
All right...

44:22.016 --> 44:26.231
Ten bucks each if they want to see
the show... and proof of purchase?

44:26.232 --> 44:28.349
They gotta wear one of these!

44:28.350 --> 44:29.168
Great.

44:29.169 --> 44:33.285
Once the sun goes down...
things are going to get crazy!

44:51.827 --> 44:53.764
♪ I'm driving in my car ♪

44:53.765 --> 44:55.602
♪ I'm in my car alone ♪

44:55.603 --> 44:57.440
♪ I like to drive it fast ♪

44:57.441 --> 44:59.590
♪ I like to drive it slow ♪

45:05.932 --> 45:07.929
Hey... you didn't say you were
in the middle of nowhere.

45:07.930 --> 45:08.988
Hey, man... where are you?

45:08.989 --> 45:09.988
Says I'm an hour out.

45:09.989 --> 45:12.345
Park a few blocks away and
call me when you're close.

45:12.346 --> 45:13.544
And remember, no one can know...

45:13.545 --> 45:16.842
Yeah, I got... Yeah, I got it, I got it.
Discreet.

45:17.561 --> 45:18.799
Dipshit.

45:18.800 --> 45:20.197
Lord have mercy.

45:20.198 --> 45:23.734
Are the centuries-old legends
of Leechwood County true?

45:23.735 --> 45:26.747
Two bodies have been
discovered with mutilated

45:26.748 --> 45:29.248
necks and drained
completely of blood.

45:29.249 --> 45:31.792
In a town anxious for
answers, there are

45:31.793 --> 45:34.523
three men who claim
that vampire hunting...

45:34.524 --> 45:37.122
is in their blood.

45:38.580 --> 45:40.478
This is the place.

45:40.478 --> 45:44.553
Lord have mercy on
my tired old bones.

45:44.554 --> 45:47.550
My God, Stacey... I love you!

45:52.206 --> 45:54.365
Will you sign my boobs?

45:54.484 --> 45:57.500
I've read all your books!
I love you, I love you!

45:57.501 --> 46:00.958
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much for coming.

46:01.956 --> 46:03.555
Hey!

46:04.993 --> 46:07.869
I think what you're
doing is super tacky.

46:07.870 --> 46:12.125
I mean, vampires are beautiful
and sensual creatures.

46:12.126 --> 46:17.440
This sort of exploitation undermines
any real knowledge there is to vampires.

46:17.441 --> 46:20.898
And if you read my books,
you would know that.

46:21.956 --> 46:25.532
I'm really looking forward to
scaring the shit out of these people.

46:29.049 --> 46:32.167
No such thing as too much!

46:32.606 --> 46:36.301
I super-glued a guy's dick
and sent him to the E.R.,

46:36.302 --> 46:38.560
but I thought it was hilarious.

46:38.561 --> 46:40.557
Everything in the wood-chipper!

46:40.957 --> 46:42.175
Quite the turnout.

46:42.176 --> 46:45.452
I know, right?
It's actually kind of amazing.

46:45.453 --> 46:48.410
But it looks like it's
going to be a lost cause.

46:48.430 --> 46:49.369
I'm sorry, what?

46:49.370 --> 46:52.904
Given there are those foolish enough
to pay for this pathetic attempt,

46:52.905 --> 46:55.264
I've calculated that you
won't come even close to

46:55.265 --> 46:57.720
reimbursing the fifty-thousand
dollars by tomorrow.

46:57.721 --> 46:59.977
You can say goodbye to House Harker.

46:59.978 --> 47:03.935
I just came by to see which room
I'd like to make my office.

47:06.452 --> 47:07.889
What can we expect for tonight?

47:07.890 --> 47:10.047
Tonight is not for
the faint of heart...

47:10.048 --> 47:12.605
We're trained professionals though,
and you're gonna expect...

47:12.606 --> 47:13.305
Enjoying yourself?

47:13.306 --> 47:15.262
One sec. Okay?

47:15.263 --> 47:16.780
Can this wait?

47:16.781 --> 47:18.499
When were you going to tell me?!

47:18.500 --> 47:21.855
After we were evicted?!
After we lost everything?!

47:21.856 --> 47:23.594
Hold on, it's not what you think...

47:23.595 --> 47:26.011
You can't talk your way
out of this one, Gerry.

47:26.012 --> 47:28.189
This whole thing was
your idea, not mine.

47:28.190 --> 47:31.106
Not Charlie's. And it
sure as hell wasn't dads.

47:31.107 --> 47:34.001
Dad always wanted to hide things.
People need to know...

47:34.002 --> 47:35.716
About you!

47:35.717 --> 47:37.160
Right, Gerry?!

47:37.161 --> 47:39.518
It's always about you.

47:39.519 --> 47:42.281
You left and you didn't
even care about us.

47:42.414 --> 47:46.023
You never called once to
see how dad was doing.

47:46.172 --> 47:50.207
He died and you were too
busy focusing on you!

47:50.208 --> 47:52.395
And then when you weren't
getting enough attention,

47:52.395 --> 47:55.342
you tucked your tail between your legs
and came back to see us.

47:55.343 --> 47:57.755
And now you're trying to help.

47:58.380 --> 48:00.418
We don't need your help, Gerry.

48:04.019 --> 48:05.820
We don't need you.

48:06.170 --> 48:08.747
We were doing fine without you.

48:13.143 --> 48:15.701
I'll go pack my things.

48:21.335 --> 48:23.334
Paige!

48:25.303 --> 48:27.436
This is my gift.

48:30.878 --> 48:32.935
I made it.

48:32.936 --> 48:37.051
Not for the wedding... not for Wayne...

48:37.052 --> 48:39.025
for you.

48:39.669 --> 48:41.268
I love you.

48:41.467 --> 48:43.426
I always have.

48:44.824 --> 48:47.220
You're my beautiful mermaid.

48:47.221 --> 48:50.061
Jesus, Ned. Not now!

48:52.656 --> 48:54.233
So you don't like the carving?

48:54.234 --> 48:56.327
No!

49:05.823 --> 49:08.679
Are you kidding me, man?!
I almost killed you!

49:09.080 --> 49:10.797
Great. Another vampire.

49:10.798 --> 49:15.194
Nobody said there was gonna be
two vampires. Look, buddy...

49:16.812 --> 49:18.191
Buddy?

49:30.178 --> 49:33.234
Tanner? Hey!

49:33.235 --> 49:35.072
What, is this guy lost?

49:35.073 --> 49:37.070
I don't think we should
go through with this.

49:37.071 --> 49:38.669
Gerry, I stole these costumes!

49:38.670 --> 49:39.828
Well that was your id...
Wait, what?

49:39.829 --> 49:41.026
This is our chance!

49:41.027 --> 49:45.782
The entire town paid money to see
us catch a real vampire, just...

49:45.783 --> 49:49.918
We only made twelve-hundred dollars!
That's not even close!

49:49.919 --> 49:52.776
Come tomorrow, we lose the house.

49:57.311 --> 49:59.150
I lost the house.

50:00.148 --> 50:02.227
This whole mess is my fault.

50:08.060 --> 50:09.318
It's definitely your fault.

50:09.319 --> 50:11.176
Come on, Charlie.

50:11.177 --> 50:12.116
But look at us.

50:12.117 --> 50:14.713
We look fantastic.
Especially me.

50:14.714 --> 50:17.989
When we were little...
people used to stare at us and point...

50:17.990 --> 50:22.905
And they'd say, "Look at those weirdo
Harker kids and their loser friend Ned."

50:22.906 --> 50:24.684
No they didn't.

50:25.283 --> 50:27.162
But what did Dad say?

50:27.421 --> 50:29.899
He said, "Life is a chess match..."

50:30.298 --> 50:32.956
and the game isn't
over until checkmate."

50:33.455 --> 50:37.330
Gerry, you think you've lost
the house, but you haven't.

50:37.331 --> 50:41.166
Not yet. It's still on the board.
It's like when you left.

50:41.167 --> 50:44.843
Paige and I thought we'd lost you,
but Dad always said...

50:44.844 --> 50:47.202
"He has to play his own game."

50:48.420 --> 50:52.037
He was so proud of you, Gerry.
Because you'd won.

50:52.076 --> 50:57.551
You made Twirl! The 'Karate
Kid' of baton twirling films.

50:57.831 --> 51:01.168
So if we lose the house, it's okay.

51:01.307 --> 51:03.785
There are other pieces on the board.

51:04.284 --> 51:06.203
We still have each other.

51:06.842 --> 51:08.181
And Ned.

51:11.617 --> 51:13.216
Harkers.

51:15.273 --> 51:18.529
And their mutherfucking
bad ass friend, Ned Morris.

51:18.530 --> 51:21.747
All right, let's go find our vampire.

51:24.444 --> 51:27.959
Holy shit, man! Now
that is fucking scary!

51:27.960 --> 51:31.075
That make-up is next level, Tanner!

51:31.457 --> 51:33.154
Like I said... kind of an asshole.

51:33.155 --> 51:34.134
He doesn't sound very healthy.

51:34.135 --> 51:36.173
He's probably in character.

51:36.672 --> 51:39.190
We should probably get him out of sight.
Come on!

51:41.926 --> 51:43.144
That's a great idea!

51:43.145 --> 51:45.901
Yeah, yeah! Go inside and
lay low until we're ready!

51:45.902 --> 51:47.200
There's snacks downstairs.

51:47.201 --> 51:50.419
Hey, make yourself comfortable.
Mi casa es su casa.

52:05.922 --> 52:07.340
Hey! I want to talk to you!

52:07.341 --> 52:08.719
Wayne, I know... Paige is pissed.

52:08.720 --> 52:10.097
No, no, not you.

52:10.098 --> 52:11.776
No... Hey, Charlie. Not you.

52:11.777 --> 52:14.213
Hey, you! I know you
have feelings for Paige.

52:14.214 --> 52:15.192
Come on.

52:15.193 --> 52:17.591
Hey... hey look!

52:18.230 --> 52:20.027
I know you love her, okay?

52:20.028 --> 52:21.806
I've learned to accept that.

52:21.807 --> 52:27.701
But why can't you accept me and stop
being so dad-gum mean all the time?!

52:56.931 --> 53:03.146
Once you become a best-selling
author, it is so hard to meet guys.

53:03.785 --> 53:06.541
It's like they can't handle my gift.
You know?

53:06.542 --> 53:07.101
Yeah.

53:07.102 --> 53:10.697
My special connection with vampires.

53:10.698 --> 53:14.048
I can sense their presence, you know?

53:14.049 --> 53:18.928
I mean if one was near...
it's like I could feel him...

53:18.929 --> 53:21.767
I know. It's a lot to take in.

53:28.600 --> 53:30.417
You know what? I love her.

53:30.418 --> 53:33.454
And I'm gonna take good care of
her and you know that!

53:33.455 --> 53:34.634
Guys, maybe we should get inside.

53:34.635 --> 53:38.011
Give the guy a break!
He's pouring his heart out here.

53:38.410 --> 53:42.267
See what I mean?
It's like he doesn't even listen!

53:43.485 --> 53:46.369
Am I sparkling?

53:53.695 --> 53:56.552
Aw, man. People are
trying to leave already.

54:09.599 --> 54:11.298
I'm sorry?

54:16.592 --> 54:19.110
Was that... was that so hard?

54:21.707 --> 54:24.842
Ha ha... okay, pal.

54:24.843 --> 54:26.982
Okay. That's good.

54:29.239 --> 54:31.517
Yeah. Okay.

54:32.336 --> 54:35.192
Let's get back in there,
before we miss all the fun, right? Yeah.

54:35.193 --> 54:36.792
Okay. Okay.

54:36.931 --> 54:38.768
Hey, where'd you go?

54:38.769 --> 54:41.186
Line for the pisser was too long.

54:41.187 --> 54:44.228
And I brought my private stock.

54:50.658 --> 54:52.726
What the fuck?!

54:52.735 --> 54:55.112
Hey, Doc, what in the
Sam Hell are you doing?

54:55.113 --> 54:57.330
Are you taking to the bottle again?

54:57.331 --> 55:00.381
His wife is gonna be so disappointed.

55:00.668 --> 55:02.761
What's wrong with his face?!

55:02.762 --> 55:04.874
Step back.

55:11.226 --> 55:14.762
Sheriff Wayne for Kip...
Sheriff Wayne for Kip, do you copy?

55:14.763 --> 55:16.280
Sheriff, we've got a situation here!

55:16.281 --> 55:19.217
Another dead body on the side of the
road... neck mangled like the others...

55:19.218 --> 55:20.896
few miles outside of Leechwood.

55:20.897 --> 55:24.392
His ID says his name is... Tanner.

55:24.393 --> 55:26.230
Tanner Scott.

55:26.231 --> 55:29.908
Wearing a funny costume like he's from
Transylvania or something like that.

55:30.907 --> 55:32.005
Shit!

55:32.006 --> 55:33.164
We knew he didn't sound healthy.

55:33.165 --> 55:36.920
How could I be so stupid?!
We invited it inside the house!

55:36.921 --> 55:39.099
Repeatedly. The skull?!

55:41.416 --> 55:43.893
Because I didn't think there
would be an actual vampire.

55:43.894 --> 55:46.230
We agreed to put it in the basement.
It has all things that Gerry hates!

55:46.231 --> 55:48.428
It's dark and constricted
and it has spiders...

55:48.429 --> 55:49.907
Yes, I know that's all
things that vampires love.

55:49.908 --> 55:51.345
Dad would be so pissed right now!

55:51.346 --> 55:52.364
Hey!

55:52.365 --> 55:55.163
Will somebody tell me what
the hell is going on?!

56:02.215 --> 56:03.014
So the actor...? Yes!

56:03.015 --> 56:03.633
Was a...? Yes!

56:03.634 --> 56:04.992
And he's a...? Yep.

56:04.993 --> 56:07.111
Vampires can't be real!

56:07.330 --> 56:08.630
Can they?

56:10.967 --> 56:12.518
Hey Kip, I'm gonna
want you to step away

56:12.519 --> 56:14.222
from that body... it
might spring up on you.

56:14.223 --> 56:16.840
Nah... I don't think so.
He looks like...

56:16.841 --> 56:18.398
He looks like shit.

56:18.399 --> 56:19.557
He looks like shit, Wayne.

56:19.558 --> 56:21.735
He was just feeding. Gaining power.

56:21.736 --> 56:25.732
All he needed was the skull and
now he can create a legion of vampires!

56:27.290 --> 56:28.229
Why aren't they escaping?

56:28.230 --> 56:30.002
Well there's crosses
on the doorway and

56:30.003 --> 56:31.865
on the door handles...
and the windows...

56:31.866 --> 56:34.382
Looks like your great-grandpa
made this house apotropaic.

56:34.383 --> 56:35.382
Aca-paca-what?!

56:35.383 --> 56:36.540
Wards off evil.

56:36.541 --> 56:37.639
They're trapped!

56:37.640 --> 56:38.419
For now.

56:38.420 --> 56:41.315
If they can't get outta the house...
we're home free!

56:41.316 --> 56:43.173
Sun comes up, they're fried!

56:43.174 --> 56:45.411
Come on, fellas. First rounds on Wayne!

56:45.412 --> 56:47.111
Guys?

56:47.850 --> 56:49.529
Where's Paige?

56:53.364 --> 56:55.634
Fuck!

56:55.922 --> 56:57.701
I'm going in!

57:00.297 --> 57:03.253
No, no, no, no! Close the...
door!

57:03.254 --> 57:04.192
Dick!

57:04.193 --> 57:04.892
What?

57:04.893 --> 57:07.729
Come on, Wayne is a cop with a gun.
I'm sure he's fine...

57:07.730 --> 57:09.727
Dadgummit!

57:09.728 --> 57:11.327
Jeez...

57:11.486 --> 57:15.521
So... how long do you think it
would take for your sister

57:15.522 --> 57:18.298
to get over the fact
that I accidentally...

57:18.299 --> 57:21.097
shoved her fiance
into a den of vampires?

57:21.416 --> 57:22.219
Three months?

57:22.244 --> 57:23.720
Paige!

57:23.894 --> 57:25.334
Paige!

57:26.471 --> 57:28.426
Come on, pick up!

57:30.847 --> 57:32.546
Hey!

57:33.544 --> 57:36.821
And now they know there's
someone upstairs.

57:37.740 --> 57:39.339
Oops.

57:48.449 --> 57:49.887
It's time?

57:49.888 --> 57:51.547
Yeah...

58:02.255 --> 58:04.294
Hold this.

58:06.591 --> 58:08.348
In nomine Patris et Filii
et Spiritus Sancti...

58:08.349 --> 58:09.008
You sure?

58:09.009 --> 58:10.506
This is gonna work!

58:10.507 --> 58:12.106
Yes!

58:12.125 --> 58:13.804
Maybe.

58:16.161 --> 58:17.280
Fuck it!

58:25.712 --> 58:27.289
Now!

58:27.290 --> 58:29.249
Now!

58:29.848 --> 58:31.065
Boys... now!

58:31.066 --> 58:33.425
I did! It isn't working!

58:34.423 --> 58:36.162
Now, boys!

58:39.498 --> 58:41.337
Get outta here!

58:48.969 --> 58:50.006
Charlie, you did it!

58:50.007 --> 58:50.686
Potato!

58:50.687 --> 58:51.386
French toast!

58:51.387 --> 58:54.743
No it has to be french fries...
that's the joke! Never mind!

59:08.149 --> 59:10.586
Gerry... turn on your sunlamp!

59:10.587 --> 59:11.785
I need an outlet!

59:11.786 --> 59:13.724
There's a light right here!

59:23.514 --> 59:26.330
She scratched me!
Am I gonna turn into a vampire?!

59:26.331 --> 59:28.629
It has to be a full moon I think!

59:29.048 --> 59:31.846
Do you guys know
anything about vampires?

59:39.178 --> 59:41.297
I am so sorry!

59:47.610 --> 59:49.612
Die!

59:54.203 --> 59:56.462
I'm gonna make sure she's dead.

01:00:05.072 --> 01:00:07.451
Yep, she's dead.

01:00:19.758 --> 01:00:21.015
Where is everybody?

01:00:29.448 --> 01:00:31.666
Go go go go go go!

01:00:42.315 --> 01:00:44.114
Why are they popping?!

01:00:45.572 --> 01:00:47.930
They always do that!

01:00:48.229 --> 01:00:50.166
Will you put that thing down?!

01:00:50.167 --> 01:00:52.206
It just needs some juice!

01:00:54.143 --> 01:00:56.721
Come on, baby!
Give me some juice!

01:01:02.515 --> 01:01:05.113
Here comes the juice!

01:01:11.726 --> 01:01:13.784
Here it comes.

01:01:22.015 --> 01:01:24.114
Hell yeah, it worked!

01:01:24.433 --> 01:01:26.032
Fake...

01:01:37.859 --> 01:01:39.818
I can take care of myself.

01:01:58.299 --> 01:02:00.158
Go Devils.

01:02:03.594 --> 01:02:05.412
Paige?

01:02:08.549 --> 01:02:10.148
Pai...?

01:02:19.298 --> 01:02:21.656
Where's your clothes, big fella?

01:02:31.765 --> 01:02:34.103
No, no, no, no...!

01:02:34.623 --> 01:02:36.941
Please don't pop.

01:02:40.776 --> 01:02:42.414
It's warm.

01:02:49.787 --> 01:02:52.086
I don't want to talk to you, Gerry.

01:03:01.016 --> 01:03:02.715
Gerry!

01:03:04.113 --> 01:03:07.231
Twirl!

01:03:46.131 --> 01:03:47.989
And... big finish.

01:03:50.167 --> 01:03:51.345
Thank you.

01:03:51.346 --> 01:03:54.242
You are my sunshine...

01:03:54.243 --> 01:03:57.459
my only sunshine...

01:03:57.460 --> 01:04:01.015
you make me happy...

01:04:01.016 --> 01:04:03.240
when skies are...

01:04:03.277 --> 01:04:06.350
- What do I even do?!
- Kick him in the fuse box!

01:04:06.351 --> 01:04:07.350
What does that mean?

01:04:07.351 --> 01:04:09.029
The spice rack!

01:04:19.458 --> 01:04:22.215
I said, I don't want to talk to you...

01:04:25.232 --> 01:04:27.111
Walter, come on!

01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:31.067
Go!
I'll hold them off as best I can!

01:04:34.144 --> 01:04:36.001
Go, boys.

01:04:36.002 --> 01:04:38.119
Get Paige outta here.

01:04:45.472 --> 01:04:49.669
Come get some, you
satanic sons-a-bitches!

01:05:04.173 --> 01:05:05.772
Ned?

01:05:06.931 --> 01:05:08.670
Hey, Gerry.

01:05:08.749 --> 01:05:10.286
Charlie.

01:05:10.287 --> 01:05:13.605
If you're not too busy, could you
get this hairy fucker off of me?

01:05:19.818 --> 01:05:21.836
What is that... pee?

01:05:24.833 --> 01:05:27.311
If anything, he peed on me!

01:05:27.690 --> 01:05:29.468
Make me piss myself...

01:05:31.466 --> 01:05:33.505
Get off of me, Kevin!

01:06:00.177 --> 01:06:01.215
Paige?

01:06:01.216 --> 01:06:03.355
We came here to...

01:06:04.973 --> 01:06:05.912
Save you?

01:06:05.913 --> 01:06:07.769
Who says I need saving?

01:06:10.107 --> 01:06:11.965
I feel really bad losing the house.

01:06:11.966 --> 01:06:12.844
How everything went...

01:06:12.845 --> 01:06:14.444
DOWN!

01:06:15.063 --> 01:06:17.000
You can't lie to me, Gerry!

01:06:17.001 --> 01:06:19.257
You're right! I've been selfish.

01:06:19.258 --> 01:06:23.853
If we're gonna be family,
we have to be honest with each other!

01:06:23.854 --> 01:06:26.771
I know! I promise!

01:06:28.209 --> 01:06:30.448
I know I wasn't there for you guys...

01:06:30.927 --> 01:06:32.945
but I'm here now.

01:06:33.744 --> 01:06:36.821
And I want to be a part of everything.

01:06:39.418 --> 01:06:41.637
I love you guys!

01:06:42.155 --> 01:06:43.913
And we love you, Paige!

01:06:43.914 --> 01:06:45.411
Dammit, Ned! Not now!

01:06:45.412 --> 01:06:47.710
Got it. We'll talk later.

01:06:49.468 --> 01:06:51.645
Hey, has anyone seen Wayne?!
Where's Wayne?

01:06:51.646 --> 01:06:53.184
Anyone seen Wayne...

01:06:56.861 --> 01:06:58.520
Hey, Wayne!

01:07:08.189 --> 01:07:12.465
Aww, is that Paige?
That is so beauti...

01:07:15.302 --> 01:07:17.499
Wait, you really liked it?

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:19.998
Now I feel terrible.

01:07:20.137 --> 01:07:21.856
Guys?

01:07:22.535 --> 01:07:24.172
He seems pissed.

01:07:24.173 --> 01:07:25.571
Don't move!

01:07:25.572 --> 01:07:29.627
He can't see you if you don't move.

01:07:29.628 --> 01:07:31.786
Not moving.

01:07:36.201 --> 01:07:37.619
No!!

01:07:40.657 --> 01:07:43.255
Look! I'm immune!

01:07:46.071 --> 01:07:50.188
Not immune! Not immune!
This sucks so bad!

01:07:55.362 --> 01:07:56.961
Ned?

01:08:10.547 --> 01:08:12.265
Thank you!

01:08:46.711 --> 01:08:48.669
Check.

01:08:51.685 --> 01:08:53.964
Look at the whole board.

01:08:57.640 --> 01:08:59.359
Broken glass.

01:09:00.837 --> 01:09:03.754
You're using real wooden stakes?

01:09:03.774 --> 01:09:07.669
Why is there a wood-chipper
at the top of the stairs?

01:09:07.670 --> 01:09:10.527
You can't latch the spice rack.

01:09:10.787 --> 01:09:12.962
I can't get out.

01:09:12.964 --> 01:09:15.640
Don't... don't overthink it.

01:09:15.642 --> 01:09:17.461
Just look.

01:09:19.037 --> 01:09:21.696
They hit him again, Dad.

01:09:23.334 --> 01:09:26.930
I still don't know what to do.

01:09:27.050 --> 01:09:28.966
Don't be scared, Charlie.

01:09:28.968 --> 01:09:31.885
I know... It can get crazy out there.

01:09:31.886 --> 01:09:34.901
But you know when that
happens to me what I do?

01:09:34.902 --> 01:09:38.080
I use... this.

01:09:39.358 --> 01:09:41.274
What is this even attached to?

01:09:41.276 --> 01:09:43.252
You're my beautiful mermaid, Paige.

01:09:43.254 --> 01:09:45.233
Maybe I will use your pencil then.

01:09:55.242 --> 01:09:57.540
I need you, buddy.

01:10:14.942 --> 01:10:17.261
Oh, come on!

01:10:28.549 --> 01:10:30.046
Shit. My head.

01:10:30.047 --> 01:10:31.786
My God! Ned!

01:10:33.064 --> 01:10:35.063
You're alive!

01:10:39.278 --> 01:10:40.877
Okay.

01:10:42.075 --> 01:10:44.292
Not now. Not ever.

01:10:44.293 --> 01:10:45.892
Take your time.

01:10:47.250 --> 01:10:48.947
My God, did you piss yourself?

01:10:48.948 --> 01:10:50.406
No... no.

01:10:50.407 --> 01:10:53.205
They're monsters, Paige.
They peed on me!

01:10:55.382 --> 01:10:57.399
How did Ned change back?

01:10:57.400 --> 01:10:59.337
Maybe if you kill the big bad guy...?

01:10:59.338 --> 01:11:01.621
Before the first sunrise,
the power of the

01:11:01.622 --> 01:11:04.613
first is destroyed...
the rest are restored.

01:11:29.088 --> 01:11:31.886
Yeah, but they were all assholes.

01:11:33.204 --> 01:11:36.560
No. Paige, I didn't mean...

01:11:36.561 --> 01:11:40.416
About Wayne, I'm so sorry.
I had to.

01:11:42.135 --> 01:11:45.452
Thank you for taking
care of us, big brother.

01:11:58.758 --> 01:12:00.357
Wayne!

01:12:00.936 --> 01:12:04.793
That smarts! Dadgummit!

01:12:05.911 --> 01:12:08.867
Wayne's alive. Yay.

01:12:08.868 --> 01:12:13.504
If staking a guy in the shoulder
killed a vampire... I'd be a goner!

01:12:13.704 --> 01:12:15.762
That's a good job!

01:12:16.021 --> 01:12:17.900
What about Walter?

01:12:18.679 --> 01:12:20.416
What about me?

01:12:23.194 --> 01:12:27.950
Well, this isn't the first time I've
been bathed in the blood of vampires.

01:12:28.169 --> 01:12:29.768
Ooh...

01:12:32.245 --> 01:12:34.563
I'm so sorry.

01:12:34.782 --> 01:12:36.741
I made T-shirts.

01:13:11.266 --> 01:13:14.383
Sorry you lost your pencil, Charlie.

01:13:19.757 --> 01:13:22.274
- Potato.
- French Fries.

01:13:22.275 --> 01:13:23.712
So...

01:13:23.713 --> 01:13:25.970
they really are...

01:13:25.971 --> 01:13:27.599
vampires.

01:13:28.529 --> 01:13:30.277
Vampires?

01:13:30.278 --> 01:13:34.486
They're nothing compared to
the goddamn werewolves.

01:13:37.418 --> 01:13:47.618

*** SONG LIVES FOR EVER ***

01:15:30.953 --> 01:15:33.358
Is this thing still recording?

01:15:33.359 --> 01:15:36.806
The live stream? My God...

01:15:36.807 --> 01:15:38.977
How many views?

01:15:38.978 --> 01:15:40.915
A hundred and twenty-five...

01:15:40.916 --> 01:15:44.323
- All right.
- Million. Okay.

01:15:45.308 --> 01:15:48.240
We could do the show!

01:15:50.219 --> 01:15:53.503
- What?
- We could definitely do the show.

01:15:53.504 --> 01:15:55.161
Wait. Did we make money?
I was thinking that first, we should...

01:15:55.162 --> 01:15:57.538
maybe get a kitchen. We
don't have a kitchen anymore.

01:15:57.539 --> 01:15:59.976
I mean, the kitchen can come after.
We've got to focus like right now.

01:15:59.977 --> 01:16:02.174
We have momentum. Look at this.

01:16:02.175 --> 01:16:03.493
Our house is halfway through a remodel.

01:16:03.494 --> 01:16:05.910
I know, but right now we can't
stop the progress. We made money.

01:16:05.911 --> 01:16:07.988
- Wait, can they hear us?
- Every word.

01:16:07.989 --> 01:16:11.884
Hel... Hello!
If you can hear us, Hello!

01:16:11.885 --> 01:16:13.782
Hello! Hello!

01:16:13.783 --> 01:16:14.941
We've gotta strike while the iron's
hot, you know? Hello! Hello!

01:16:14.942 --> 01:16:16.060
We've gotta strike while
the iron's hot, you know?

01:16:16.061 --> 01:16:18.717
Like, like... we'll focus on the show...
You know what else? We could make...

01:16:18.718 --> 01:16:20.336
and go to Bed, Bath & Beyond.
More money, guys.

01:16:20.337 --> 01:16:23.333
And we will get some stuff...
Let's not just make money off of this...

01:16:23.334 --> 01:16:25.051
I mean, we also have to go to, like...
Let's make money off Ned's wood.

01:16:25.052 --> 01:16:27.129
To Home Depot.
If you are looking for Ned's Wood.

01:16:27.130 --> 01:16:29.986
You can't just go to Bed, Bath & Beyond
to get everything. You can go to http.

01:16:29.987 --> 01:16:33.542
Because it's a great store, but that's
where you get... I think it's a colon...

01:16:33.543 --> 01:16:35.940
just the stuff you put in a finished
house. Two... two forward slashes...

01:16:35.941 --> 01:16:37.978
And we don't have a finished house.
We have

01:16:37.979 --> 01:16:40.096
half a house. Ned's,
N-E-D-S, underscore...

01:16:40.097 --> 01:16:41.754
You know, we've got a...
Wood.org.

01:16:41.755 --> 01:16:43.832
A... a fuse-box for a spice rack.
Go there...

01:16:43.833 --> 01:16:45.052
And Ned goes to the
bathroom in a bucket...

01:16:45.053 --> 01:16:46.190
I don't have any
sculptures right now...

01:16:46.191 --> 01:16:48.188
I don't even have a bucket.
Because I had a little accident with.

01:16:48.189 --> 01:16:49.555
You don't have a bucket?
I have to go to the

01:16:49.556 --> 01:16:52.183
bathroom in... the other
wood that I had there.

01:19:04.133 --> 01:19:05.619
What's up?

01:19:05.620 --> 01:19:08.531
Shit!
I should've been there.

01:19:08.532 --> 01:19:09.846
Been there? Sheriff Wayne
said the whole town is dead.

01:19:09.847 --> 01:19:13.141
Yeah, but I wanted in
on some of the action.

01:19:13.142 --> 01:19:16.545
Action?
We would have died first, bro.

01:19:17.251 --> 01:19:19.896
- No, not me.
- Especially you. No.

01:19:19.897 --> 01:19:21.774
Guys like us don't live long
in situations like that.

01:19:21.775 --> 01:19:23.991
What do you mean 'guys like us'?

01:19:23.992 --> 01:19:26.729
When you wake up in the morning and
you look in the mirror, what do you see?

01:19:26.730 --> 01:19:28.167
John McClane.

01:19:28.168 --> 01:19:30.033
No, what do you see?

01:19:30.034 --> 01:19:31.986
John Rambo.

01:19:32.184 --> 01:19:35.320
You've seen the movies, bro.
We always die first.

01:19:35.321 --> 01:19:37.321
Always.

01:19:37.399 --> 01:19:40.151
Look at us. What are we?

01:19:40.616 --> 01:19:42.532
Cops.

01:19:43.305 --> 01:19:49.621
