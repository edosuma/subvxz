WEBVTT

00:01.069 --> 00:02.636
**

00:02.703 --> 00:03.904
Twilight: As you've
all probably noticed,

00:03.971 --> 00:06.707
it's been quite some time
since the map has sent us

00:06.774 --> 00:08.342
on a mission of friendship.

00:08.409 --> 00:10.278
Yeah, ever since
Starlight messed with it

00:10.344 --> 00:12.746
to go back in time and
tried to change history.

00:12.813 --> 00:16.217
Yes. Since then. But
as part of her studies,

00:16.284 --> 00:18.119
Starlight's been
assisting me

00:18.186 --> 00:20.221
and together we think
we've come up with a spell

00:20.288 --> 00:21.722
that will get it
working again.

00:21.789 --> 00:23.391
Woo-hoo! Oooh!
Well done!

00:25.693 --> 00:27.161
Now, without further ado...

00:30.931 --> 00:36.370
[whoosh]

00:37.705 --> 00:40.408
Everyone: Oooh!

00:40.474 --> 00:42.410
Fluttershy and
Twilight in Appleoosa!

00:42.476 --> 00:44.645
NO! Me and Rainbow
Dash in Las Pegasus!

00:44.712 --> 00:46.814
NO! Rainbow Dash and
Twilight in Yakyakistan!

00:46.880 --> 00:49.483
NO! TWILIGHT AND TWILIGHT IN
TWILIGHT'S CASTLE!? [gasp]

00:49.550 --> 00:52.186
ME! ME! OH! ME!

00:52.253 --> 00:55.389
AND RARITY! Oooooh I hope
it's some faraway place

00:55.456 --> 00:57.825
that nopony has
gone before!

00:57.891 --> 01:01.829
[laugh] Well. [chuckle]
Maybe not TOO far away.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.198
An adventure somewhere that
has modern conveniences

01:04.265 --> 01:06.167
would be preferable.

01:06.234 --> 01:09.470
[gasp] CANTERLOT! [gasp]
This is wonderful!

01:09.537 --> 01:10.671
I can check the boutique!

01:10.738 --> 01:12.206
Perhaps there will
be some social events

01:12.273 --> 01:13.407
that we can attend!

01:13.474 --> 01:14.642
[gasp] I'll have to
pack extra outfits!

01:14.708 --> 01:17.445
What will I wear!

01:17.511 --> 01:19.313
You know, some
ponies get excited

01:19.380 --> 01:21.149
about the
silliest things.

01:24.652 --> 01:27.921
* My little pony,
my little pony *

01:27.988 --> 01:29.890
* Aaaahhh *

01:29.957 --> 01:31.559
* My little Pony *

01:31.625 --> 01:34.528
* I used to wonder what
friendship could be. *

01:34.595 --> 01:36.297
* My Little Pony *

01:36.364 --> 01:38.832
* Until you all shared
its magic with me. *

01:38.899 --> 01:40.634
* Big adventure! *
* Tons of fun *

01:40.701 --> 01:42.470
* A beautiful heart! * *
Faithful and strong! *

01:42.536 --> 01:45.173
* Sharing kindness *
* it's an easy feat *

01:45.239 --> 01:47.408
** And magic makes it
all complete! *

01:47.475 --> 01:49.510
* To have my little pony *

01:49.577 --> 01:52.813
* Do you know you're all
my very best friends? *

01:52.880 --> 01:55.349
**

02:00.354 --> 02:04.892
**

02:04.958 --> 02:08.329
[sigh] Now then. As far as
finding a friendship problem,

02:08.396 --> 02:10.364
I suggest we start
at the castle

02:10.431 --> 02:11.699
and begin to
question the proper--

02:11.765 --> 02:14.468
Oh, Rarity, you don't
find a friendship problem.

02:14.535 --> 02:17.571
It finds you! We just
need to go with the flow

02:17.638 --> 02:19.773
and eventually KABLAM! We
get friendship problem'd

02:19.840 --> 02:21.575
right between
the eyes!

02:21.642 --> 02:23.811
Well, this is a
team effort

02:23.877 --> 02:25.979
so if you feel we
should go with the flow,

02:26.046 --> 02:28.716
then with the flow
we shall go!

02:28.782 --> 02:31.485
Where is the flow
saying we should go?

02:31.552 --> 02:34.322
You know Canterlot! What
do you think we should do?

02:34.388 --> 02:37.491
Oh! Take your pick!
Culture, couture, cuisine!

02:37.558 --> 02:39.560
[rumbling]

02:41.529 --> 02:43.664
Oh my. Well, it sounds
like your stomach

02:43.731 --> 02:46.300
is saying we should
flow towards some lunch?

02:46.367 --> 02:47.668
I know JUST where to go!

02:49.570 --> 02:51.004
Restaurant Row!

02:51.071 --> 02:53.241
The absolute best
place for fine dining

02:53.307 --> 02:54.842
in all of Equestria.

02:54.908 --> 02:57.345
Ooooooh, so many choices!

02:57.411 --> 03:00.414
Where should we go? This
one? That one? Those ones?

03:00.481 --> 03:02.850
Any establishments
that have this.

03:02.916 --> 03:04.918
The three-hoof rating.

03:04.985 --> 03:06.887
Um... whose hooves?

03:06.954 --> 03:10.424
Why, Zesty Gourmand,
the queen of cuisine.

03:10.491 --> 03:12.760
When it comes to food, she
is the ultimate authority

03:12.826 --> 03:15.263
in Canterlot and
thus all Equestria!

03:15.329 --> 03:17.598
She judges a restaurant
on cuisine, dÃ©cor

03:17.665 --> 03:19.867
and presentation.
Without her approval,

03:19.933 --> 03:22.336
a restaurant simply
cannot survive.

03:22.403 --> 03:24.672
What's so important
about her approval?

03:24.738 --> 03:26.774
Zesty grew up around
fine dining

03:26.840 --> 03:29.710
and everypony hangs
on her every word

03:29.777 --> 03:31.412
when it comes
to cuisine.

03:31.479 --> 03:34.682
WOW. Then the food
here must be AMAZING!

03:34.748 --> 03:37.985
Lead the way, partner!
Wheeeeee! [giggle]

03:41.855 --> 03:45.659
[gasp] Oh my. Such
presentation!

03:45.726 --> 03:47.961
* [classical music] *

03:48.028 --> 03:54.435
[chews] Oh. [chews]
Ah, yes. Very nice.

03:54.502 --> 03:57.571
[chews and gulps]

03:57.638 --> 04:02.009
Ugh. Maybe I'm not in the
mood for... whatever this is.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.677
Can we try someplace else?

04:04.978 --> 04:08.582
[chews] Ugh. Maybe
one more stop?

04:10.083 --> 04:11.552
[blech!] Nope.

04:13.521 --> 04:16.023
Maybe instead of trusting
somepony else's hooves,

04:16.089 --> 04:17.925
I should pick
the next place?

04:17.991 --> 04:19.860
Ugh! Very well.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.929
[sniffing]

04:24.798 --> 04:27.468
[sniffing]

04:27.535 --> 04:28.369
[gasp]

04:32.706 --> 04:37.478
The Tasty Treat.
It's very... rustic.

04:37.545 --> 04:40.748
It looks like it
hasn't even been rated!

04:40.814 --> 04:42.816
Thank goodness! [giggle]

04:45.052 --> 04:46.487
[door closes]

04:48.622 --> 04:53.527
* [East Indian music] *

04:53.594 --> 04:56.096
Are we sure
they're open?

04:56.163 --> 04:58.466
[sniffs] Mmmm! It
smells open!

04:58.532 --> 05:00.468
[clatter]

05:00.534 --> 05:03.036
Oh! Are you here for lunch?

05:03.103 --> 05:04.805
Yes indeedy!

05:04.872 --> 05:08.642
I'm Saffron Masala, the chef
here at the Tasty Treat!

05:08.709 --> 05:11.579
The most exotic
cuisine in Canterlot.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.547
Would you like to hear
about the specials?

05:13.614 --> 05:15.082
We're actually in
a bit of a hu--

05:15.148 --> 05:15.949
YES, PLEASE!

05:16.016 --> 05:18.686
We have a curried oatcake--

05:18.752 --> 05:20.053
We'll take one!

05:20.120 --> 05:23.123
And a grass sandwich that
has been marinated overnight

05:23.190 --> 05:25.426
in a mustard
Dijon dressing.

05:25.493 --> 05:27.395
How can we say
no to that?

05:27.461 --> 05:28.696
A-And for you?

05:28.762 --> 05:30.631
Oh! Me? Oh, I'm
fine. Thank you.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.601
No rating.

05:34.868 --> 05:38.005
[sigh] [Mumbling]
Anyway they won't come.

05:38.071 --> 05:39.840
Hiya! What's your name?

05:39.907 --> 05:41.709
Coriander Cumin.

05:41.775 --> 05:43.076
Are you a chef here, too?

05:43.143 --> 05:45.746
My daughter cooks. I host.

05:45.813 --> 05:47.848
Then why are you
stacking chairs?

05:47.915 --> 05:52.986
Without customers, I have no
pony to host for. So, I stack.

05:53.053 --> 05:54.321
Father! STOP IT!

05:54.388 --> 05:57.558
Don't close up the restaurant
around our guests!

05:57.625 --> 05:59.627
What does it matter?
When they leave,

05:59.693 --> 06:02.195
nopony else will
be coming in!

06:02.262 --> 06:05.833
Well, your attitude isn't
going to bring anyone in!

06:05.899 --> 06:08.802
Can't you at least
pretend to be positive?

06:08.869 --> 06:13.474
[slurp] Sooooooo
goooooood! [gobbles]

06:13.541 --> 06:16.510
Father: You are doing enough
pretending for the both of us.

06:16.577 --> 06:20.180
Nopony here wants
to try anything new.

06:20.247 --> 06:22.850
I know when to
throw in the towel!

06:22.916 --> 06:25.886
Um. Pinkie, perhaps we
should excuse ourselves.

06:25.953 --> 06:29.757
[chews] Oh Rarity,
try this!

06:29.823 --> 06:32.860
[gulps] Oooh!

06:32.926 --> 06:35.996
Maybe if you would listen
to my ideas for once--

06:36.063 --> 06:39.567
Oh yes, I did not move
halfway across Equestria

06:39.633 --> 06:43.070
for my daughter that
I NEVER listen to!

06:43.136 --> 06:45.138
Rarity. I think that
friendship problem

06:45.205 --> 06:47.808
just KABLAMMED us
right between the eyes.

06:47.875 --> 06:51.044
These two? Oh I
don't know, darling.

06:51.111 --> 06:54.047
The food IS excellent, but
I'm not sure there's much

06:54.114 --> 06:56.650
you and I can do
to help them.

06:56.717 --> 06:57.985
What would you
have me do?

06:58.051 --> 06:59.653
We can't even get
Zesty Gourmand

06:59.720 --> 07:01.088
to come to our
restaurant!

07:01.154 --> 07:03.090
She took one look
at how empty it was

07:03.156 --> 07:05.125
and said it wasn't
even worth rating!

07:05.192 --> 07:06.794
THAT'S IT!

07:06.860 --> 07:09.897
YES! Uh, what's it?

07:09.963 --> 07:13.033
The flow HAS led us here!
THIS is our mission!

07:13.100 --> 07:15.636
We are going to get
you a Three Hoof rating

07:15.703 --> 07:20.007
and save your restaurant! I
can get Zesty Gourmand here.

07:20.073 --> 07:22.943
[gasp] And I can pack
this place with ponies!

07:23.010 --> 07:25.946
Hmph! And how do you
intend to do such a thing?

07:26.013 --> 07:27.781
Just leave it to us!

07:35.188 --> 07:38.759
Father, will you PLEASE
stop packing things?

07:38.826 --> 07:40.761
When the lovely
pony comes back

07:40.828 --> 07:43.263
and says she couldn't
convince Zesty Gourmand

07:43.330 --> 07:46.567
to come visit us, we will
need to pack all this up.

07:46.634 --> 07:48.569
I'm just getting
a head start.

07:48.636 --> 07:50.771
You really don't
know Rarity.

07:50.838 --> 07:53.006
I've done it!

07:53.073 --> 07:54.608
See?

07:54.675 --> 07:56.644
It took all of my
charm and cajoling,

07:56.710 --> 07:58.946
but I was able to
convince Zesty Gourmand

07:59.012 --> 08:00.681
to come and try the food!

08:00.748 --> 08:02.850
What is the catch?

08:02.916 --> 08:07.254
Ah, yes. Well, um, there
IS a bit of a challenge.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.724
The only time she can make
herself available is tonight.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.760
Pfft! Oh yeah, right.

08:12.826 --> 08:13.861
What is it?

08:13.927 --> 08:16.163
Zesty rates a restaurant
on cuisine, decor

08:16.229 --> 08:20.233
AND presentation. And she
has very specific tastes.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.703
If she's coming tonight,
there IS quite a bit of work

08:22.770 --> 08:23.971
that needs to get done.

08:24.037 --> 08:25.272
Like what?

08:25.338 --> 08:27.040
Oh a tweak here, a tuck there.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.810
Some slight modifications
to the menu. [chuckle]

08:29.877 --> 08:32.079
We just need the place to
feel more cosmopolitan.

08:32.145 --> 08:33.547
[scoffs]

08:33.614 --> 08:36.884
Father, after Rarity went to
all of this trouble for us,

08:36.950 --> 08:39.319
can't we at least try?

08:39.386 --> 08:41.321
Why don't I stay
behind with Coriander

08:41.388 --> 08:43.724
to get the restaurant
ready for Zesty's arrival.

08:43.791 --> 08:46.293
You and Saffron can try
and drum up some business.

08:46.359 --> 08:49.897
One packed restaurant
coming right up.

08:49.963 --> 08:53.266
Coriander, I understand
your trepidation.

08:53.333 --> 08:56.003
But I promise you, we will
get those hooves by making

08:56.069 --> 08:58.138
this place feel just like
all of the other restaurants

08:58.205 --> 09:00.373
on Restaurant Row!

09:00.440 --> 09:03.977
[sigh] I hope my father
doesn't drive Rarity crazy.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.346
It'll be fine. Rarity's
going to make sure that

09:06.413 --> 09:08.649
The Tasty Treat is the
most unique and beautiful

09:08.716 --> 09:10.250
restaurant in Canterlot!

09:10.317 --> 09:13.553
Not like all those stuffy
places on Restaurant Row!

09:16.089 --> 09:20.994
* [upbeat Indian music] *

09:21.061 --> 09:22.896
* Here's what I know *

09:22.963 --> 09:24.698
* If you want to succeed *

09:24.765 --> 09:28.636
* You must follow the
trends; That's the key. *

09:28.702 --> 09:30.070
* If you want to show *

09:30.137 --> 09:31.772
* That you've got
what it takes *

09:31.839 --> 09:34.808
* You must be what
they want you to be *

09:34.875 --> 09:41.715
* *

09:41.782 --> 09:43.416
* Here's what I know *

09:43.483 --> 09:45.018
* Your food is so good *

09:45.085 --> 09:48.922
* The flavors so fancy and
free *

09:48.989 --> 09:50.991
* You just need to show *

09:51.058 --> 09:52.492
* That unique sense of taste *

09:52.559 --> 09:56.096
* Go on, be yourself,
let them see! *

09:56.163 --> 09:57.698
* It's gonna work *

09:57.765 --> 10:00.000
* I know it's gonna work *

10:00.067 --> 10:03.671
* It's gonna work out
just fine; trust me. *

10:03.737 --> 10:05.072
* It's gonna work *

10:05.138 --> 10:07.407
* I swear it's gonna work *

10:07.474 --> 10:10.678
* It's gonna work out
just fine you'll see. *

10:10.744 --> 10:17.384
* *

10:17.450 --> 10:19.152
* You need to change *

10:19.219 --> 10:20.854
* If you want to compete *

10:20.921 --> 10:24.858
* But fear not, for
I know what to do. *

10:24.925 --> 10:26.760
* I know it feels strange *

10:26.827 --> 10:28.495
* But trust me when we're done *

10:28.561 --> 10:32.199
* We'll make sure that
you're a hit too. *

10:32.265 --> 10:33.366
* Don't ever change *

10:33.433 --> 10:36.036
* Being different is good *

10:36.103 --> 10:39.840
* Don't let what others
do be your cue! *

10:39.907 --> 10:41.441
* Never rearrange *

10:41.508 --> 10:43.176
* Cause somepony said
you should *

10:43.243 --> 10:46.847
* Just trust your heart,
it will know what to do *

10:46.914 --> 10:47.981
* It's gonna work *

10:48.048 --> 10:50.483
* I know it's gonna work *

10:50.550 --> 10:54.021
* It's gonna work out
just fine trust me. *

10:54.087 --> 10:55.756
* It's gonna work *

10:55.823 --> 10:58.125
* I swear it's gonna work *

10:58.191 --> 11:01.829
* It's gonna work out
just fine you'll see. *

11:01.895 --> 11:04.131
* Be unique! *

11:04.197 --> 11:06.033
* Just be the same! *

11:06.099 --> 11:07.901
* Trust your heart! *

11:07.968 --> 11:09.636
* You'll make your name! *

11:09.703 --> 11:13.073
* We'll help you every
step of the way! *

11:13.140 --> 11:15.308
* Because we know
what you need to do *

11:15.375 --> 11:17.044
* and you should know it too. *

11:17.110 --> 11:18.178
* It's gonna work *

11:18.245 --> 11:19.913
* I know it's gonna work *

11:19.980 --> 11:24.017
* It's gonna work out
just fine trust me. *

11:24.084 --> 11:25.819
* It's gonna work *

11:25.886 --> 11:28.121
* I swear it's gonna work *

11:28.188 --> 11:31.391
* It's gonna work out
just fine you'll see! *

11:31.458 --> 11:37.898
* *

11:37.965 --> 11:40.300
* [song ends] *

11:40.367 --> 11:42.502
[gasp] The day is almost over

11:42.569 --> 11:45.806
and we haven't found
anyponies! What will we do?

11:45.873 --> 11:49.276
Try harder! FILLIES
AND GENTLECOLTS!

11:49.342 --> 11:52.279
Check out the super stupendous
and amazing cuisine

11:52.345 --> 11:57.117
of the Tasty Treat! GRAND
RE-OPENING TONIGHT!

11:57.184 --> 11:58.986
How many Hooves
does it have?

11:59.052 --> 12:02.255
No hooves yet, but
hopefully soon!

12:02.322 --> 12:05.358
Well, when it gets
rated, let us know!

12:05.425 --> 12:07.360
Ughh! Stupid hooves!

12:10.864 --> 12:12.365
Oh, look at this, hon!

12:12.432 --> 12:14.267
Oh, The Tasty Treat.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.003
Do you think that's
a restaurant, Sugar?

12:16.069 --> 12:17.437
Yes! Yes it IS!

12:17.504 --> 12:19.306
We came to Canterlot
from Winnieapolis

12:19.372 --> 12:21.141
to be adventurous!

12:21.208 --> 12:24.577
But so far the food in all
these hoity- toity places

12:24.644 --> 12:28.882
tastes like somepony cooked up
nuthin' with a side of nuthin!

12:28.949 --> 12:31.551
Well, please, come
try The Tasty Treat.

12:31.618 --> 12:33.386
I think it's going
to be exactly

12:33.453 --> 12:34.822
what you're
looking for!

12:40.293 --> 12:42.229
[sigh] This is
going to be exactly

12:42.295 --> 12:43.596
what Zesty is looking for!

12:43.663 --> 12:45.398
[door opens]

12:45.465 --> 12:48.068
Father, we're ba-- [gasp]

12:48.135 --> 12:51.138
Rarity. What did
you do?

12:51.204 --> 12:53.173
Welcome to The Tasty Treat.

12:53.240 --> 12:56.844
You can eat here if you
want. Or not. Who cares?

12:56.910 --> 13:00.447
I know! Isn't it perfect?
Zesty is sure to love it!

13:00.513 --> 13:02.916
I thought we were trying to
make this the most unique

13:02.983 --> 13:04.617
and beautiful
restaurant in Canterlot.

13:04.684 --> 13:08.021
Not make it exactly like
every other restaurant!

13:08.088 --> 13:10.090
[chuckle] We want
to help our friends

13:10.157 --> 13:12.592
by getting them three hooves.
That will only happen

13:12.659 --> 13:14.361
if this IS like every
other restaurant.

13:16.463 --> 13:19.332
Father, what is this?

13:19.399 --> 13:23.070
NOT THAT! ANYTHING BUT THAT!

13:23.136 --> 13:26.974
This is what we must cook
if we want to succeed here!

13:27.040 --> 13:29.176
This isn't what I wanted!

13:29.242 --> 13:32.946
I wanted Canterlot
to like US for US!

13:33.013 --> 13:35.415
Rarity, how could you
ruin the restaurant!

13:35.482 --> 13:38.919
Ah! [splutters] We've
helped SAVE the restaurant!

13:38.986 --> 13:41.088
Now where are the
other guests?

13:41.154 --> 13:43.523
How many other
ponies are coming?

13:43.590 --> 13:44.925
Two.

13:44.992 --> 13:48.495
Just TWO? I thought you
said you could pack a place

13:48.561 --> 13:50.430
with ponies no matter what!

13:50.497 --> 13:51.932
YOU said you would make
the restaurant better

13:51.999 --> 13:54.935
so I guess we both didn't know
what we were talking about!

13:55.002 --> 13:56.403
[knock at door]

13:56.469 --> 13:59.106
[gasp] ZESTY GOURMAND!
Everypony! Places!

14:14.021 --> 14:16.623
Welcome to the Tasty Treat.

14:16.689 --> 14:19.159
What can I get you
this evening?

14:19.226 --> 14:21.094
I hardly think it matters.

14:21.161 --> 14:24.998
But by all means, try
your best to impress.

14:25.065 --> 14:27.167
Well, we'll both try the
special this evening,

14:27.234 --> 14:29.202
maybe with a little
kick to it, eh?

14:29.269 --> 14:31.438
Yeah, we've been craving
some food with actual taste.

14:35.442 --> 14:38.278
Saffron Masala!
What are you doing?

14:38.345 --> 14:42.215
I'm trying to save
our reputations.

14:42.282 --> 14:45.485
I've given it at least
a little bit of flavor.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.720
No, no, no, no! But that's
not what Zesty wants!

14:47.787 --> 14:50.423
What kind of food expert
DOESN'T want flavor?

14:50.490 --> 14:51.992
That's insane!

14:55.595 --> 14:57.197
I'm taking this out there.

14:57.264 --> 14:59.732
No! Zesty will hate it!

14:59.799 --> 15:02.035
You are going to
RUIN this for them!

15:02.102 --> 15:06.439
No! I'm trying to fix
it after YOU ruined it!

15:06.506 --> 15:09.376
Nooooooooooo!

15:09.442 --> 15:10.410
[splat]

15:13.546 --> 15:17.384
I think we are done here.

15:17.450 --> 15:20.988
Zesty! Please wait.
Allow me to explain.

15:21.054 --> 15:24.557
Rarity. When it comes to
fashion, you are adequate.

15:24.624 --> 15:27.127
But take some advice
from a friend.

15:27.194 --> 15:29.662
Keep your opinions
out of restaurants.

15:29.729 --> 15:33.766
Substandard food, laughable
service and I would think

15:33.833 --> 15:36.703
even YOU could recognize
that the decor here

15:36.769 --> 15:41.041
is trying desperately
while desperately failing.

15:41.108 --> 15:44.177
Recommending a disreputable
place such as this

15:44.244 --> 15:47.747
could do serious damage
to your social standing.

15:47.814 --> 15:49.149
Disreputable?

15:49.216 --> 15:52.419
You mean a place with food
that actually tastes good?

15:52.485 --> 15:55.755
Anypony can throw
ingredients together

15:55.822 --> 15:59.692
and create an obvious taste
that uncultured ponies

15:59.759 --> 16:02.062
like those two can register.

16:02.129 --> 16:03.530
Hey!

16:03.596 --> 16:06.366
But it takes a TRUE
culinary artist

16:06.433 --> 16:08.568
to create a subtle taste.

16:08.635 --> 16:11.671
The barest hint
of a sensation.

16:11.738 --> 16:15.575
That's what I bring to
Canterlot. That's art.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.216
I'm so embarrassed.

16:23.283 --> 16:25.485
I don't know that there are
words to adequately express

16:25.552 --> 16:28.088
how truly sorry we are.

16:28.155 --> 16:32.792
The worst has happened. No use
crying over spilled food now.

16:32.859 --> 16:36.396
Here, this always cheered
me up when I was younger.

16:36.463 --> 16:40.633
[gasp] My spicy flat
noodle soup! [slurps]

16:40.700 --> 16:46.339
Mmm! Oh my, this is
truly delightful.

16:46.406 --> 16:48.808
This is the best thing
you've made so far.

16:48.875 --> 16:51.478
And I thought the food
before was the best!

16:51.544 --> 16:54.314
That's all I've ever
wanted to do, Father.

16:54.381 --> 16:56.549
Make food for the
ponies of Canterlot

16:56.616 --> 17:00.187
like the food we made
together when I was younger.

17:00.253 --> 17:03.690
It has been so long since
we've cooked together. [laugh]

17:03.756 --> 17:05.758
Remember how you used
to hide the ingredients

17:05.825 --> 17:06.793
you did not like.

17:06.859 --> 17:09.662
[laugh]

17:09.729 --> 17:11.398
You know what?

17:11.464 --> 17:13.366
Who cares what
some stuffy unicorn

17:13.433 --> 17:16.236
thinks of the food
here. It's exquisite.

17:16.303 --> 17:18.171
That's true.

17:18.238 --> 17:20.240
And you don't need three
silly hooves in your window

17:20.307 --> 17:21.408
to prove it.

17:21.474 --> 17:23.310
That's double true!

17:23.376 --> 17:26.546
You just need ponies in
here to give it a chance.

17:26.613 --> 17:29.249
Ponies that will tell
everypony else in Canterlot

17:29.316 --> 17:31.718
that the Tasty Treat is
the best food in the city!

17:31.784 --> 17:34.354
THAT'S TRUE TIMES THREE!

17:34.421 --> 17:38.558
But without Zesty's approval,
nopony will even try our food.

17:38.625 --> 17:41.294
Oohoho, yes they will.

17:41.361 --> 17:44.164
Pinkie! We ARE the
perfect team for this;

17:44.231 --> 17:45.898
we were just doing
the wrong jobs.

17:45.965 --> 17:48.135
I will go out and
bring the crowd.

17:48.201 --> 17:51.271
You stay here and make sure
this place is every bit

17:51.338 --> 17:54.741
as unique and rustic as it
was the moment we walked in.

17:54.807 --> 17:56.643
And what about us?

17:56.709 --> 18:00.713
You two? You are going to
cook. Make whatever you want.

18:00.780 --> 18:03.750
And make a lot of it. I
intend to bring a crowd!

18:03.816 --> 18:06.453
* [upbeat Indian music] *

18:06.519 --> 18:10.157
Would the owner of one of the
premier boutiques in Canterlot

18:10.223 --> 18:11.924
put her stamp of
approval on something

18:11.991 --> 18:13.826
that wasn't fabulous?

18:13.893 --> 18:24.171
**

18:24.171 --> 18:32.645
**

18:35.848 --> 18:37.016
It's almost time.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.819
Is everypony ready for
the grand re-re-opening?

18:39.886 --> 18:43.890
Before we open, my father and
I just wanted to say thank you

18:43.956 --> 18:45.225
for all of your help.

18:45.292 --> 18:47.760
We've both been so stressed
about the restaurant

18:47.827 --> 18:50.630
succeeding that we forgot
what it was we loved about it

18:50.697 --> 18:52.031
in the first place.

18:52.098 --> 18:54.934
Cooking is something we
used to love to do together.

18:55.001 --> 18:56.736
No matter what happens next,

18:56.803 --> 18:59.439
thank you for
reminding us of that.

18:59.506 --> 19:02.642
Oh you guys! GROUP HUG!

19:02.709 --> 19:04.911
[grunt][laugh]

19:04.977 --> 19:08.315
Now come on! We've
got a party to throw!

19:10.683 --> 19:13.920
Oooh! Wow! It
smells really good!

19:13.986 --> 19:18.358
Welcome to the Tasty Treat!
Make yourselves comfortable!

19:24.731 --> 19:27.834
Please, feel free
to sample the food!

19:27.900 --> 19:29.736
Zesty: What's this?

19:29.802 --> 19:34.341
What is everypony doing here?
This place has no hooves.

19:34.407 --> 19:36.743
It is not in keeping
with the level of cuisine

19:36.809 --> 19:39.512
that I have set
for Canterlot.

19:39.579 --> 19:42.815
Nopony told you this
place was acceptable.

19:42.882 --> 19:46.719
Uh, Rarity and her friend said
it was good. They told us.

19:46.786 --> 19:51.491
They told you? And who are
they to tell you anything?

19:51.558 --> 19:55.027
Rarity can tell you what hats
to wear with which skirts.

19:55.094 --> 19:57.830
Her friend can tell you how
to maintain a tragic look

19:57.897 --> 19:59.666
for a frizzy mane.

19:59.732 --> 20:02.802
They can't tell you
what food you can eat.

20:02.869 --> 20:05.872
No, we can't. And
neither can you.

20:05.938 --> 20:08.675
Nopony has the right to tell
these ponies what to think.

20:08.741 --> 20:11.278
Zesty, you have very specific--

20:11.344 --> 20:12.479
And very strange!

20:12.545 --> 20:15.348
Yes and very strange
opinions about food.

20:15.415 --> 20:16.949
And that's your right.

20:17.016 --> 20:19.319
But just because you like
your food a certain way,

20:19.386 --> 20:20.920
there is no reason
to tell these ponies

20:20.987 --> 20:22.489
that they need to
do the same.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.023
Rarity is right!

20:24.090 --> 20:26.859
I for one think the
food here is delicious.

20:26.926 --> 20:29.796
I own the Smoked Oat
on Restaurant Row!

20:29.862 --> 20:32.031
I hate the food we make!

20:32.098 --> 20:36.769
From now on, it's all
smoked, basted and grilled!

20:36.836 --> 20:41.341
This food is an inspiration!
I own the Bake Shop!

20:41.408 --> 20:43.343
I'm going to bake my
mother's Bundt cake

20:43.410 --> 20:46.446
the way she made
it! Full of flavor!

20:46.513 --> 20:49.949
Yes! Yeah!

20:50.016 --> 20:52.852
Zesty, are you sure you
wouldn't like to try the food?

20:52.919 --> 20:55.455
Ignoring a unique and fresh
establishment such as this

20:55.522 --> 20:59.058
could do serious damage
to your social standing.

20:59.125 --> 21:00.727
[huffs]

21:02.729 --> 21:03.896
[slam]

21:04.931 --> 21:09.035
[cheers]

21:09.101 --> 21:10.903
Thank you so much!

21:10.970 --> 21:13.473
You are both truly amazing.

21:13.540 --> 21:18.578
**

21:18.645 --> 21:23.350
Nothing can stop the dynamic
duo of Pinkie and Rarity!

21:23.416 --> 21:27.987
[happy chattering]
