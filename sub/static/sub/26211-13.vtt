also like that.

Copy, I'll be right there.

09:52.600 --> 09:54.133
How are you?

09:54.166 --> 09:57.533
- I understand we had
an issue last night.

09:58.600 --> 10:00.000
- Coming up...

10:00.033 --> 10:02.734
- So I'm a bit
of a hectic chef.

10:02.767 --> 10:04.500
- I like that.

10:04.533 --> 10:05.700
- Obviously,
she has a crush on me.

10:05.734 --> 10:07.233
Awkward.

10:12.467 --> 10:13.200
- I understand we had

10:13.200 --> 10:13.600
- I understand we had
an issue last night.

10:14.734 --> 10:16.100
- Yeah.
- Okay.

10:16.133 --> 10:19.333
Here's all I need.
- Okay.

10:19.367 --> 10:21.734
- I need you to do your job.
- Yep.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.066
- I don't need you to have
a confrontation

10:24.100 --> 10:26.166
with our chief stew
in front of guests.

10:26.200 --> 10:28.066
- Yeah.

10:28.100 --> 10:30.133
- I don't really care
what prompted it.

10:30.166 --> 10:32.700
- Out of all of the times
she's humiliated me

10:32.734 --> 10:34.667
in front of everyone,

10:34.700 --> 10:38.233
did it cross my mind to go to
the captain and tattle on her?

10:38.266 --> 10:39.600
No.

10:39.633 --> 10:42.300
I honestly am not
an angry person.

10:42.333 --> 10:47.133
Unfortunately, it came out
in a less-than-eloquent way,

10:47.166 --> 10:49.667
but I agree
with everything you're saying,

10:49.700 --> 10:52.266
and I will just do my job.

10:52.300 --> 10:55.400
- Nothing more, nothing less.
- Smooth sailing ahead.

10:55.433 --> 10:59.133
- Great, thank you.
- Thank you.

10:59.166 --> 11:01.166
- She let her mouth
write a check

11:01.200 --> 11:02.333
that her ass couldn't cash.

11:02.367 --> 11:04.233
We've got two charters to go.

11:04.266 --> 11:07.700
She's gonna have to suck it up
and do the right thing.

11:07.734 --> 11:09.100
[slurps]

11:10.734 --> 11:12.734
- Morning.
- Hey, how are you?

11:12.767 --> 11:16.166
- Not very good, and now
I'm having a bad hair day,

11:16.200 --> 11:18.200
which is in general
just a bad day.

11:25.266 --> 11:26.633
- Copy.

11:26.667 --> 11:28.166
- And you guys
are doing the slide?

11:28.200 --> 11:29.700
- Yeah.

11:29.734 --> 11:31.667
- Okay.
It's frustrating as hell.

11:31.700 --> 11:34.000
I don't ever get to sit
through the slide setup,

11:34.033 --> 11:35.734
and I'm never on anchor
in the morning

11:35.767 --> 11:37.300
to really learn
how that goes down.

11:37.333 --> 11:39.066
- Have you ever dropped
an anchor before?

11:39.100 --> 11:41.100
- Not on a boat of this size.
I'd like to learn.

11:41.133 --> 11:42.700
- Just shadow him.

11:42.734 --> 11:46.200
- I keep bringing it up,
but I'm usually shut down.

11:46.233 --> 11:48.066
Doesn't ----ing matter
what I say.

11:48.100 --> 11:50.667
I'm literally doing exactly
what all of you guys want,

11:50.700 --> 11:53.233
which is put my head down
and be a ----ing day worker.

11:53.266 --> 11:56.266
- Fix the attitude
or ship out, bud.

11:56.300 --> 11:57.734
- Yes, sir.

11:57.767 --> 11:59.367
It's annoying.
All right.

11:59.400 --> 12:01.066
I'm gonna go fix that up first

12:01.100 --> 12:02.066
'cause they're
laying out there.

12:02.100 --> 12:04.734
- Oh, thank you.

12:04.767 --> 12:06.633
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

12:06.667 --> 12:08.633
- Man, that looks like rain
in the distance, hey?

12:08.667 --> 12:09.734
- How are you doing?

12:09.767 --> 12:11.333
- Good, and you?
- Good.

12:11.367 --> 12:13.200
- Have you guys
sorted your sh-- out again?

12:13.233 --> 12:14.467
- No.
- No?

12:14.500 --> 12:16.333
- I've been taking
so much sh--.

12:16.367 --> 12:18.233
- Mm-hmm.

12:18.266 --> 12:20.200
The only thing that people
were, like, a bit taken back by

12:20.233 --> 12:22.066
was just
the way you snapped.

12:22.100 --> 12:25.200
- Fair enough, fair enough.
It's just crazy.

12:28.367 --> 12:30.400
- Look at how pretty.
- I know.

12:33.400 --> 12:35.166
- We have some croissants.

12:35.200 --> 12:37.700
There's plain and chocolate.

12:37.734 --> 12:39.333
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

12:39.367 --> 12:41.500
- Pardon me. I'm just gonna
scoot this in here.

12:41.533 --> 12:43.300
- Mmm, that's delicious.

12:43.333 --> 12:45.433
- Very good.
- It's the perfect omelet.

12:45.467 --> 12:47.133
- All I can tell from
this group of guests

12:47.166 --> 12:50.367
is that at least two of them
are in the Mafia.

12:50.400 --> 12:52.300
At least they're not
too high maintenance.

12:52.333 --> 12:54.667
I bet Laura wouldn't
tell Richard to check himself.

12:54.700 --> 12:57.767
That's what cement boots will
scare people into, submission.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.467
So we're getting ready
to pull the anchor

12:59.500 --> 13:01.133
and head to the next spot.

13:01.166 --> 13:02.667
We'll have all
the water toys out.

13:02.700 --> 13:03.767
- Sounds like a plan.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.100
- Okay, Ash, pull 'em up.

13:06.133 --> 13:07.166
- Copy, Cap.

13:10.066 --> 13:11.066
- Morning.

13:14.200 --> 13:15.400
- Anchor's in the pocket.

13:15.433 --> 13:17.400
- Lock it in.
We're out of here.

13:17.433 --> 13:19.400
- Can I wash these fenders up?
Kind of grimy, a little bit.

13:19.433 --> 13:21.367
- If you want to just give it
a quick wipe, yeah.

13:21.400 --> 13:23.433
Good job, Tyler.

13:23.467 --> 13:27.266
Tyler picks up on things
really fast, and with Rhylee

13:27.300 --> 13:29.767
in such a great mood,
it's a breath of fresh air.

13:48.066 --> 13:49.066
Whatever.

13:53.467 --> 13:56.033
- We have some guests.
- Good morning.

13:56.066 --> 13:57.767
- Morning, how we doing?
- Good.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.300
- Is this the cove we're gonna
stay in for tonight?

13:59.333 --> 14:01.266
- Uh-huh.
We're making our approach in.

14:01.300 --> 14:03.233
Deck crew,
get ready for arrival.

14:03.266 --> 14:05.000
I'm gonna want four shots.

14:05.033 --> 14:06.100
- Four shots, copy that.

14:06.133 --> 14:08.433
- And drop.

14:08.467 --> 14:10.767
- We really appreciate you
allowing us up here.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.767
- Yeah, it's not a problem.
- Wow.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.300
- Hey, Tyler, get with Ashton.

14:15.333 --> 14:16.467
You guys start
setting up the slide, man.

14:16.500 --> 14:18.133
Rhylee will do this.

14:18.166 --> 14:19.567
- Copy.
- While we're doing this,

14:19.600 --> 14:21.033
do you want
to set up that line?

14:21.066 --> 14:22.133
- I already did.
- Oh, you did?

14:22.166 --> 14:24.033
- [sighs]

14:24.066 --> 14:25.433
- The guys are bro-ing up
and thinking they need

14:25.467 --> 14:28.266
all this muscle man power,
and I'm tired of it.

14:28.300 --> 14:31.233
I'm tired of being overlooked,
and what point does it end?

14:31.266 --> 14:33.033
- Ready?
- Okay.

14:33.066 --> 14:34.433
- We can readjust it
once we inflate it a bit.

14:34.467 --> 14:36.200
- Okay.

14:36.233 --> 14:37.500
- Are you gonna be
joining us for dinner tonight?

14:37.533 --> 14:39.033
- I'd be glad to.

14:39.066 --> 14:40.767
- There you go, go.

14:42.200 --> 14:43.266
- How are we doing?
- Fabulous.

14:43.300 --> 14:44.500
- Would you like
a glass of rosé?

14:44.533 --> 14:46.200
- Sure, I'll have
a glass of rosé.

14:46.233 --> 14:48.066
- Yeah?
Kate, Kate, Josiah.

14:48.100 --> 14:49.100
Can we have a glass
of Whispering Angel, please?

14:49.133 --> 14:50.500
- Copy.
- Okay.

14:50.533 --> 14:52.200
You know I have a store
in Beverly Hills,

14:52.233 --> 14:53.467
so that would be fabulous.

14:53.500 --> 14:55.100
We were looking for one.
Thank you.

14:55.133 --> 14:56.467
- All good?

14:56.500 --> 14:58.166
- I'm gonna need
to use your laptop,

14:58.200 --> 14:59.300
and I'm just gonna
give her a checklist,

14:59.333 --> 15:01.300
because she said
when she arrived

15:01.333 --> 15:03.200
that she had
so much experience,

15:03.233 --> 15:04.767
but, clearly, she doesn't know
what she's doing.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.166
I don't care
if she's lying or not,

15:07.200 --> 15:09.033
but what I do care about
is the fact that the guests

15:09.066 --> 15:11.266
have no towels to wipe
their body after a shower

15:11.300 --> 15:15.133
and no toilet paper to wipe
their ass after they sh--.

15:22.166 --> 15:25.233
- Oh, my gosh.
Do you see how far up it is?

15:25.266 --> 15:26.600
This is insane.

15:26.633 --> 15:29.367
I'm getting heart palpitations
just looking.

15:29.400 --> 15:32.233
Doreen, are you gonna
give it a whirl?

15:32.266 --> 15:33.500
- Oh, no,
I'm afraid of heights.

15:33.533 --> 15:35.066
- Is Bruce going?

15:35.100 --> 15:36.533
- Oh, I don't think
he'll go either.

15:36.567 --> 15:38.300
- I'm really big
on active guests.

15:38.333 --> 15:41.133
On my old fire crew,
my nickname was Throttle.

15:41.166 --> 15:42.567
I love the rush,

15:42.600 --> 15:45.367
but these guests,
they are just super lame.

15:45.400 --> 15:47.233
- Darn, it's raining.

15:47.266 --> 15:49.166
- I'm gonna take a risk
for lunch.

15:49.200 --> 15:51.533
- Oh, really? Lobster?
- Duck confit.

15:51.567 --> 15:54.033
- I love duck confit.
- And something else salad.

15:54.066 --> 15:55.400
Like, something fresh.

15:55.433 --> 15:57.567
- So just big plates?
- Yeah, big white plates.

15:57.600 --> 15:59.266
- Yep.

16:02.567 --> 16:06.066
- You all right?
- Just let me do it. I got it.

16:06.100 --> 16:08.500
- It's like she wants
to prove something.

16:08.533 --> 16:10.433
- What? What?

16:10.467 --> 16:12.133
- Just stop trying to do
too much on your own.

16:12.166 --> 16:13.433
If you need help,
just come get me.

16:13.467 --> 16:14.533
- I don't.
- If I'm here to help,

16:14.567 --> 16:16.166
just let me ----ing help.

16:16.200 --> 16:17.266
Just let me know
when you need help, bloke.

16:17.300 --> 16:18.667
- I will. I will--

16:18.700 --> 16:20.266
- You're trying to do
too much on your own.

16:20.300 --> 16:21.667
- How?
- You just are. I can see it.

16:21.700 --> 16:24.033
- Got it.
- Rhylee, there's things

16:24.066 --> 16:25.333
why I do it, obviously, okay?

16:25.367 --> 16:27.133
- Got it. Got it. Got it.
Got it.

16:27.166 --> 16:28.600
- Are you sure?
- Got it. I ----ing got it.

16:28.633 --> 16:30.333
I'll say it one more time
before the fifth time,

16:30.367 --> 16:31.367
and I'll say it even more rude
than the fourth time

16:31.400 --> 16:32.633
I just said it.

16:32.667 --> 16:34.266
- This is how
you're talking to me?

16:34.300 --> 16:35.533
- Yeah.
Ask me four more--ask me

16:35.567 --> 16:37.567
four times if I got it,
and I say yes,

16:37.600 --> 16:39.600
and then ask me the fifth time,
I'm gonna get attitude.

16:39.633 --> 16:41.433
- It's the way you--it's
the way you're saying it.

16:41.467 --> 16:43.066
- Yeah. The fifth time,
I'm gonna get attitude.

16:43.100 --> 16:44.300
I said I got it
five ----ing times,

16:44.333 --> 16:45.400
so you want
to handle this sh--?

16:45.433 --> 16:46.433
Then do it.

16:50.667 --> 16:51.066
- I said

16:51.066 --> 16:51.567
- I said
I got it five ----ing times.

16:53.266 --> 16:54.633
I said five ----ing times
I got it,

16:54.667 --> 16:56.333
and you want me
to go somewhere else

16:56.367 --> 16:57.667
and you want
to handle this sh--?

16:57.700 --> 16:59.500
Then do it.
- No. You can do this, Rhylee.

16:59.533 --> 17:01.367
- Then let me ----ing do it.
- I'm saying as when--

17:01.400 --> 17:03.367
- I said I got it
four ----ing times.

17:03.400 --> 17:04.633
- But the way you're saying it.
I don't need attitude from you.

17:04.667 --> 17:05.700
- Because you asked me
a fifth time.

17:05.734 --> 17:07.433
- Listen, dude.

17:07.467 --> 17:09.233
I'm gonna come back--
- Quit asking me.

17:09.266 --> 17:10.500
- What the hell is going on?

17:10.533 --> 17:12.433
She's been
in such great spirits

17:12.467 --> 17:15.166
these past couple of charters
and now this?

17:15.200 --> 17:17.433
I can't keep up.
Here we ----ing go again.

17:17.467 --> 17:20.533
Listen here. You're so short.
You have an attitude problem.

17:20.567 --> 17:21.767
- Yeah, I do have an attitude

17:22.000 --> 17:23.500
when I keep
getting interrupted.

17:23.533 --> 17:25.300
Okay, tell me--tell me
what you want to say.

17:25.333 --> 17:26.700
- Okay, great. Thank you.
The fifth time you asked me

17:26.734 --> 17:29.300
the same question,
I copped the attitude--

17:29.333 --> 17:30.767
- It doesn't matter how much
times I have to ask you,

17:31.000 --> 17:33.667
you're like, "Okay, got it."
That's not a response.

17:33.700 --> 17:35.367
That's not how
you should be replying.

17:35.400 --> 17:36.700
Just so I can--sorry.

17:36.734 --> 17:38.300
- Uh...

17:38.333 --> 17:39.600
- I'm doing what
I'm supposed to doing.

17:39.633 --> 17:41.500
- Rhylee, give me
attitude--listen, listen.

17:41.533 --> 17:43.433
- I'm giving you attitude
'cause you're interrupting me.

17:43.467 --> 17:45.200
- No, I'm not gonna listen,
because you won't listen to me.

17:45.233 --> 17:46.667
- All right, Rhylee.
This is how it's gonna be.

17:46.700 --> 17:48.266
When you want to listen to me,
I'll listen to you.

17:48.300 --> 17:49.667
- Okay. If you're not
gonna listen, look,

17:49.700 --> 17:51.467
I can find someone else
that's gonna listen, all right?

17:51.500 --> 17:52.700
- Sounds great. Do that, Ross.
- All right, then.

17:52.734 --> 17:54.667
All right, buddy.
- (BLEEP) off, Ross.

17:54.700 --> 17:56.567
- You have a problem with me?
Get rid of me.

17:56.600 --> 17:58.400
- All right.
I'm just ----ing over it.

17:58.433 --> 18:00.266
I'm over it.

18:00.300 --> 18:02.300
Rhylee's had seven charters
to learn her place

18:02.333 --> 18:03.734
and trust me,
and I'm just done.

18:03.767 --> 18:05.433
I'm sick of it.
She's got to go.

18:05.467 --> 18:07.200
----ing hell.

18:07.233 --> 18:08.734
- Yeah, bloody hell is right.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
- Oh, for (BLEEP) sakes.

18:17.633 --> 18:19.433
- What happened?

18:22.533 --> 18:25.333
- So do I, man.
- Just gonna eat more.

18:25.367 --> 18:27.767
I love to see people
lose their sh--.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.300
It's, like,
the best entertainment for me,

18:31.333 --> 18:34.633
as long as I'm not the one
in the middle of it.

18:38.667 --> 18:40.667
- Hi.
- Is there anything happening?

18:40.700 --> 18:42.734
- Nope, all the guests
are sleeping.

18:42.767 --> 18:44.500
- Cool.

18:49.633 --> 18:51.734
- Oh, yeah, ----ing-- ----ing
I forgot about that.

18:51.767 --> 18:53.467
I just got sidetracked.

18:53.500 --> 18:56.266
- That's okay. I did it.
- I was gonna say, Rhylee,

18:56.300 --> 18:57.700
if she's not gonna
reason or listen,

18:57.734 --> 18:59.700
then I'm gonna find
someone else that will listen.

18:59.734 --> 19:02.066
Like, she's just giving me
so much ----ing attitude.

19:02.100 --> 19:03.734
- What, now?
- Just now.

19:03.767 --> 19:05.767
Like, she's screaming.
She's just being so--actually,

19:06.000 --> 19:08.533
I'm just like--I just have
to find someone that listens.

19:08.567 --> 19:10.533
- This is happening again?

19:10.567 --> 19:14.333
You know, one day she's happy,
and then today she's miserable.

19:14.367 --> 19:16.233
It's so annoying.

19:16.266 --> 19:17.533
- I just don't need
the ----ing attitude from her.

19:17.567 --> 19:18.533
Plain and simple.
- It's called noise, bro.

19:18.567 --> 19:20.266
- Sweet.
- Sweet.

19:20.300 --> 19:21.300
- Okay, watch your step.
It's a little slippery.

19:21.333 --> 19:22.600
- Rhy, you okay?

19:22.633 --> 19:24.467
- Can I give you
my blacks to wash?

19:24.500 --> 19:26.400
- Yeah, I can.
What's wrong?

19:26.433 --> 19:28.467
- Nothing. I'm good right now.
- Okay, you let me know.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.266
- Thanks. Thanks, Laura.
- Laura, Laura.

19:30.300 --> 19:32.033
Can you please go
around the cabins and make sure

19:32.066 --> 19:34.433
they've got full toilet paper
and fresh towels, please?

19:34.467 --> 19:37.734
- No problem.
- Did she copy? I don't know.

19:37.767 --> 19:40.567
- I didn't hear.
- Laura, did you copy?

19:40.600 --> 19:42.533
- Sorry, yep, I copied.

19:42.567 --> 19:45.567
I answered you on my mic piece,
but it wasn't plugged in.

19:45.600 --> 19:46.667
- Copy.

19:53.767 --> 19:56.266
- ----ing a dragon?

20:00.700 --> 20:02.066
- Kate, Kate, all
of the guests at the table,

20:02.100 --> 20:03.433
and I've just given them
all water.

20:03.467 --> 20:07.133
- Copy.
- So good.

20:07.166 --> 20:09.100
- Okay, we're good?
- Amen.

20:09.133 --> 20:10.500
- Ooh, that smells good.

20:10.533 --> 20:12.533
- Okay, so this is duck confit

20:12.567 --> 20:16.700
on some mirin-roasted
red cabbage and kohlrabi salad,

20:16.734 --> 20:18.700
which I infused with sake.
Enjoy.

20:18.734 --> 20:20.567
- Thank you.
- Wow.

20:21.667 --> 20:23.467
- Yeah.
- Oh, okay.

20:23.500 --> 20:25.066
- I'm cringing.

20:25.100 --> 20:26.433
I mean, it puts me
in an awkward position.

20:26.467 --> 20:28.066
Obviously,
she has a crush on me,

20:28.100 --> 20:31.533
and she's married
to Tony Soprano, so, awkward.

20:31.567 --> 20:34.567
- I think this may end up being
one of my favorite meals.

20:34.600 --> 20:37.567
The piece of basil, little
bit of cabbage. It's so good.

20:37.600 --> 20:39.467
- Hey.
- Helen's saying this is her

20:39.500 --> 20:42.300
favorite meal so far,
so good job.

20:42.333 --> 20:44.033
- Bet she ----ing loves it.

20:44.066 --> 20:46.133
- Uh-huh, and she's been
on many bodies of water.

20:46.166 --> 20:48.700
- I prefer she doesn't
get onto my body.

20:48.734 --> 20:49.700
- Oh, she's already on it.

20:49.734 --> 20:51.066
- [laughs]

20:56.467 --> 20:59.700
- So it looks like
there's a bit of wind outside.

20:59.734 --> 21:03.600
- Yeah. I mean, the weather's
going south quickly, 24 knots.

21:03.633 --> 21:07.066
- Are we fine with the slide
hanging off with this wind?

21:07.100 --> 21:09.000
- Yeah, we're gonna have
to get that in.

21:09.033 --> 21:10.700
- Deck crew, deck crew.

21:10.734 --> 21:12.567
Can someone just quickly come
to the bridge deck aft?

21:12.600 --> 21:14.700
The covers are flapping around
a little bit.

21:14.734 --> 21:16.433
- Let's go get everything
nailed down.

21:16.467 --> 21:18.133
Get the slide down,
get everything

21:18.166 --> 21:20.400
buttoned back up there
so we don't lose any covers.

21:20.433 --> 21:22.066
- Yep, copy.

21:24.667 --> 21:26.333
We'll start pulling these in.

21:26.367 --> 21:29.367
- We're starting to spin,
like in that movie.

21:29.400 --> 21:30.667
- "The Perfect Storm."

21:30.700 --> 21:32.433
- Now you can't even
see the mountains.

21:32.467 --> 21:34.100
- ----ing hell.

21:34.133 --> 21:36.200
- Do you still want me
down here or what?

21:36.233 --> 21:39.033
- Yeah, you just
stay on the controls.

21:39.066 --> 21:41.066
- Ride on, cowboy.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.467
Yeah, getting
my freshwater shower.

21:43.500 --> 21:45.433
- Looks like the weather's
picking up.

21:45.467 --> 21:47.066
- Could you feel it
in your ballsack again?

21:47.100 --> 21:49.100
- Yeah, and my nipples
started getting hard.

21:49.133 --> 21:51.633
- Ross' balls shrivel up
when he feels rain coming.

21:51.667 --> 21:53.433
[laughter]

21:54.100 --> 21:56.500
- Cleaned those plates.

21:56.533 --> 22:00.166
Do we have to dance still?
I'm not in the mood.

22:00.200 --> 22:03.166
- Better start getting your
Tahitian dance routine on.

22:03.200 --> 22:06.467
- Are you ----ing kidding me?

22:06.500 --> 22:09.400
- Where would you like me?
- Yeah, you can go.

22:09.433 --> 22:11.533
Yeah, we don't need you.

22:11.567 --> 22:14.767
- I'm ----ing over it.
I literally feel like Tyler,

22:15.000 --> 22:18.233
who has no experience
on yachts, is now above me.

22:18.266 --> 22:19.767
I just don't respect
any of these guys

22:20.000 --> 22:21.500
because they're not treating me

22:21.533 --> 22:23.033
with any kind of respect
that I deserve.

22:26.533 --> 22:28.400
- Coming up...

22:28.433 --> 22:30.033
- Are you excited for tonight?
- Usually when we go out,

22:30.066 --> 22:31.767
Ash is going after
all the girls.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.633
- Ew.

22:33.667 --> 22:35.166
I'm definitely not a girl
that just hooks up

22:35.200 --> 22:36.734
with random guys.
Stop putting sh--

22:36.767 --> 22:39.533
in my head, Adrian.
You're just miserable.

22:44.066 --> 22:44.600
- Yeah, oh, and, by the way,

22:44.600 --> 22:45.100
- Yeah, oh, and, by the way,
dinner's at 7:30.

22:47.066 --> 22:49.467
- Perfect. Do you think we can
have a night without drama?

22:49.500 --> 22:50.767
- I know I can.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.700
- She's quite
a dramatic person.

22:52.734 --> 22:55.200
- Sometimes it's better just
to let the captain handle it,

22:55.233 --> 22:57.500
'cause you're big and bad
when you're yelling at me,

22:57.533 --> 22:59.600
but to the captain,

22:59.633 --> 23:03.033
you're not saying
the same things, are you?

23:03.066 --> 23:06.200
- What's up?
- Changing.

23:06.233 --> 23:08.100
- Nap and a shower for me.

23:15.066 --> 23:18.633
- We need to fit you
for your Tahitian costume.

23:18.667 --> 23:20.734
- I thought we were gonna pick
on the new guy.

23:20.767 --> 23:22.200
- Come on.

23:22.233 --> 23:24.133
They requested
dancing entertainment,

23:24.166 --> 23:25.533
and you're like, "Not me."

23:25.567 --> 23:27.266
- The guests have all requested

23:27.300 --> 23:30.066
a Polynesian-inspired dinner
party with the yacht crew

23:30.100 --> 23:32.667
performing Tahitian-style
entertainment.

23:32.700 --> 23:34.734
- We'll throw some lima beans
in a water bottle.

23:34.767 --> 23:37.533
That's a maraca. We'll put
Ashton in some palm fronds

23:37.567 --> 23:40.367
'cause he's got a good body,
and we'll hope for the best.

23:40.400 --> 23:41.700
Laura, are you
still up for dancing?

23:41.734 --> 23:43.133
- [groans]

23:43.166 --> 23:44.333
- Yep. That's a yes.
- Yeah, she's in.

23:53.266 --> 23:56.100
- All righty. Okay, Adrian.

23:56.133 --> 23:58.033
I have to have heels on
in the kitchen.

23:58.066 --> 23:59.367
[laughter]

23:59.400 --> 24:02.600
- So you've been enjoying
your trip so far?

24:02.633 --> 24:05.200
- Well, you guys have
made it amazing.

24:05.233 --> 24:06.734
- Great.
- Yes.

24:06.767 --> 24:09.333
- Okay, I'm a bit
of a hectic chef.

24:09.367 --> 24:12.567
- I like that.

24:12.600 --> 24:14.033
So what are you doing here?

24:14.066 --> 24:16.066
- This is a truffled cream
of celery.

24:16.100 --> 24:17.567
- Okay.

24:17.600 --> 24:22.033
- I creamed it a bit
and just truffled it.

24:22.066 --> 24:23.600
- Have you got a new
sous chef, Adrian?

24:23.633 --> 24:25.033
- Yeah.

24:25.066 --> 24:26.233
- Well, he needs
to give me a job.

24:26.266 --> 24:28.367
I'm waiting for a job.

24:28.400 --> 24:31.000
- Helen reminds me of one
of my first girlfriends:

24:31.033 --> 24:34.667
Peruvian, big-breasted,
very extravagant,

24:34.700 --> 24:36.367
but her husband,
I'm a little bit worried

24:36.400 --> 24:40.266
that he's gonna
put me in a body of water.

24:40.300 --> 24:43.033
- Dinner is how I unwind.

24:43.066 --> 24:47.100
You know, the anticipation
of what's to come later on

24:47.133 --> 24:50.000
can be as amazing
as the experience.

24:50.033 --> 24:54.266
- Oh, for sure, yeah.
- [laughs]

24:54.300 --> 24:57.567
- The clouds come over.
Yes, and the rain comes down.

24:57.600 --> 24:59.700
- We want to kind of
script a story

24:59.734 --> 25:01.233
about the guest's time
on the boats,

25:01.266 --> 25:03.000
and we want to bring
some humor into it.

25:03.033 --> 25:05.600
The guests all scatter,
and the slide is no more.

25:05.633 --> 25:07.200
[laughter]

25:07.233 --> 25:08.667
We're trying to get creative.

25:08.700 --> 25:09.734
We're trying to do
some cool movements.

25:09.767 --> 25:11.200
It's gonna be fun.

25:11.233 --> 25:13.633
- Around.
- Yes, I love it.

25:13.667 --> 25:15.166
- How's your day going, Rhylee?

25:15.200 --> 25:16.734
- That's a
loaded question, Kate.

25:16.767 --> 25:18.633
- What's the matter?
- Ross is, like,

25:18.667 --> 25:20.700
telling me I have an attitude,

25:20.734 --> 25:22.700
and, like, basically
threatening to get rid of me.

25:22.734 --> 25:25.000
- You know you're not
going anywhere.

25:25.033 --> 25:27.133
Do you want advice from me?
- Sure.

25:27.166 --> 25:28.333
- You're really good
at your job,

25:28.367 --> 25:30.600
but you're in a very
fortunate situation,

25:30.633 --> 25:32.734
which is no responsibility.

25:32.767 --> 25:37.133
You could right now
just be, like, worry-free.

25:37.166 --> 25:38.700
- I should just let them
do all the heavy sh--.

25:38.734 --> 25:41.033
- Yeah. Let them worry.
Let them stress.

25:41.066 --> 25:42.767
I don't think Ross is serious
about getting rid of Rhylee.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.066
I think he's just
at his wit's end,

25:45.100 --> 25:48.333
but at least Rhylee uses
sentences that are about work

25:48.367 --> 25:50.000
instead of just saying,
"Check yourself.

25:50.033 --> 25:52.033
Check yourself.
Check yourself."

25:52.066 --> 25:54.100
Just be honest and be like,
"I want to finish the season.

25:54.133 --> 25:55.767
I'm sorry for
any misunderstandings."

25:56.000 --> 25:58.266
Just be the better person.
Don't get sassy.

25:58.300 --> 26:02.200
- [laughs]
- Okay?

26:02.233 --> 26:04.100
- Okay.

26:04.133 --> 26:06.667
Ross, Ross, can you meet me
in the beach club?

26:06.700 --> 26:10.066
- Yeah, copy, on my way.
- Oh, I love it.

26:10.100 --> 26:11.400
- Perfect.

26:11.433 --> 26:13.667
- What's up?

26:13.700 --> 26:16.400
- Ross, you know that I enjoy
working with you,

26:16.433 --> 26:20.433
but sometimes I feel like
I miss out on the big things.

26:20.467 --> 26:23.333
I want to feel more respected.

26:23.367 --> 26:26.100
I'm not called upon
to do a lot of things.

26:26.133 --> 26:28.266
Tyler's been called upon
to do slide sh--.

26:28.300 --> 26:30.100
I've got to feel like
I'm doing more than, like,

26:30.133 --> 26:31.767
the ----ing new guy coming on.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.133
- What you're doing is
----ing very important to me.

26:34.166 --> 26:35.767
I leave you
on the swim platform.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.500
That's more important
than doing a ----ing slide.

26:37.533 --> 26:39.433
I can't trust Tyler
being on the swim platform

26:39.467 --> 26:41.433
because he's new.
You are very valuable.

26:41.467 --> 26:45.066
What I don't like
is this backchat that I get.

26:45.100 --> 26:46.400
I don't want to let you go.

26:46.433 --> 26:48.100
I love working with you.
You're talking about,

26:48.133 --> 26:49.300
"Oh, you don't
give me important sh--.

26:49.333 --> 26:50.367
You don't give me
this and that."

26:50.400 --> 26:52.033
- That's how I start
to feel

26:52.066 --> 26:54.133
when I'm sitting up here
----ing cleaning, okay?

26:54.166 --> 26:55.667
It's menial.

26:55.700 --> 26:57.400
It feels like I'm ----ing
underneath

26:57.433 --> 26:59.300
every ----ing person,
and that's why I'm like,

26:59.333 --> 27:01.200
"I don't give a (BLEEP)
if you want to let me go."

27:01.233 --> 27:02.734
- If she would just stop

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
questioning
everything I ask her to do,

27:05.033 --> 27:07.700
she would realize everything
I put on her is important.

27:07.734 --> 27:11.133
It's just so frustrating to me
that she can't see that.

27:11.166 --> 27:13.433
I'm gonna let this whole
conversation go, okay?

27:13.467 --> 27:15.200
I don't--look,
the last thing I want

27:15.233 --> 27:16.400
is for me to have to make
----ing changes.

27:16.433 --> 27:18.333
I don't want you to go.

27:18.367 --> 27:20.500
I like ----ing having you here,
but this is--like, Rhylee,

27:20.533 --> 27:22.300
you can argue with me all
----ing day,

27:22.333 --> 27:24.000
or you can just agree
with me and say,

27:24.033 --> 27:27.300
"Okay, I ----ing got it."

27:27.333 --> 27:28.767
All right.

27:36.300 --> 27:38.300
- We ready?
- Yep.

27:38.333 --> 27:40.333
- Thank you for joining us.
We're so excited.

27:40.367 --> 27:42.066
- My pleasure, thanks
for having me, thank you.

27:42.100 --> 27:43.767
- So glad to have you.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.734
- I made a bunch of checklists
for Laura.

27:45.767 --> 27:47.333
She's going
to checklist herself.

27:47.367 --> 27:49.033
- Ladies.
- Thank you.

27:49.066 --> 27:50.467
- Okay, that's good.
- So what's going on?

27:50.500 --> 27:55.233
- I'm going with my list.
- Checklist yourself.

27:55.266 --> 28:00.100
- That was good. That was good.
- In every--in every room.

28:00.133 --> 28:03.166
- Yes, give me the checklist.
Let me know how you do things.

28:03.200 --> 28:06.200
I will admit that I've been
messing up on my turndowns,

28:06.233 --> 28:08.367
however, it's really hard
to stay motivated

28:08.400 --> 28:10.500
when you're being treated
in such a way.

28:10.533 --> 28:12.166
- We're ready when you are.

28:12.200 --> 28:13.166
The guests have just moved
to the table.

28:13.200 --> 28:14.433
- Cool.

28:14.467 --> 28:15.433
- God, you hear
that reef out there?

28:15.467 --> 28:17.166
- Yes.

28:17.200 --> 28:18.734
- So, Rhylee, do you want to--
- I'm good.

28:18.767 --> 28:20.233
- Lunch makes them sleepy.

28:24.166 --> 28:26.166
- I know I have a temper.

28:26.200 --> 28:28.600
It's something
that I got from my father.

28:28.633 --> 28:32.166
I don't know how to fix it,
and it's hard for me

28:32.200 --> 28:38.066
to admit that,
but, obviously, I'm the issue.

28:38.100 --> 28:39.333
- Coming up...

28:39.367 --> 28:41.133
- Walk up the stairs
and do your thing.

28:41.166 --> 28:43.200
- Hey, are we chanting?

28:43.233 --> 28:45.133
- Tonight is probably the most
important night of my life.

28:45.166 --> 28:47.166
- We have some
local performers.

28:47.200 --> 28:49.500
- Oh, my God. I'm loving this.

28:55.734 --> 28:56.400
- Once the sauce is on,

28:56.400 --> 28:56.700
- Once the sauce is on,
we're good to go.

28:58.200 --> 29:00.467
- Thanks, Chef.
- Okay.

29:00.500 --> 29:02.333
- Adrian has prepared
seared tuna,

29:02.367 --> 29:04.633
truffled celery cream,
and snow peas.

29:04.667 --> 29:06.266
- This is like
eating a painting.

29:06.300 --> 29:07.500
- Mmm.

29:07.533 --> 29:09.533
- This guy's got mad skills.

29:12.734 --> 29:14.100
- Look how small I am
compared to you.

29:14.133 --> 29:15.300
- You look good.

29:17.200 --> 29:19.500
- (BLEEP), these things
are quite pokey.

29:19.533 --> 29:21.433
- Is that too tight?

29:21.467 --> 29:23.266
- Tonight is probably the most
important night of my life.

29:23.300 --> 29:25.700
I'm going to be a Tahitian god
in front of strangers

29:25.734 --> 29:27.166
on a yacht.
I'm stoked.

29:27.200 --> 29:29.100
[laughs]

29:29.133 --> 29:30.266
- How are cabins?
- Good.

29:30.300 --> 29:32.266
- Good? Okay.

29:32.300 --> 29:34.233
- Well, I don't look Tahitian
compared to you guys at all.

29:36.600 --> 29:38.567
- That just look all right?
- All right, that looks good.

29:38.600 --> 29:40.367
- Wish I was dancing now.

29:40.400 --> 29:42.700
- Look at us.
We look brilliant.

29:42.734 --> 29:45.467
- Hm. Okay.

29:45.500 --> 29:48.233
Yes, Laura has done a great job

29:48.266 --> 29:50.233
now that I have
given her a checklist.

29:50.266 --> 29:52.600
Good job.
You did your job.

29:52.633 --> 29:55.667
- I'm so excited.
- When I say "Ia ora na,"

29:55.700 --> 29:58.467
that means walk up the stairs
and do your thing.

29:58.500 --> 30:01.467
- Hey, are we chanting?
Just feel the vibe.

30:01.500 --> 30:02.633
- That was so yummy.

30:02.667 --> 30:04.600
- I actually sliced
the cauliflower.

30:04.633 --> 30:07.100
- Ia ora na.

30:07.133 --> 30:10.600
If you guys don't mind,
we have some local performers,

30:10.633 --> 30:13.300
just to finish
off your evening.

30:13.333 --> 30:15.166
- Oh, my God.

30:15.200 --> 30:16.700
- I love it.

30:16.734 --> 30:18.700
[laughter]

30:18.734 --> 30:22.433
- So this is one of the sacred
Tahitian storybooks

30:22.467 --> 30:24.367
that's been passed on
through generations

30:24.400 --> 30:26.467
and generations of our tribe.

30:26.500 --> 30:31.233
The sun comes up
and shares its warm rays.

30:31.266 --> 30:34.633
- I'm loving this.
- The guests enjoy Jet Skiing

30:34.667 --> 30:38.166
'round and 'round the boat,

30:38.200 --> 30:43.266
but the clouds come over
and the rain comes down.

30:43.300 --> 30:47.233
The guests all scatter,
and the slide is no more.

30:47.266 --> 30:48.633
[laughter]

30:48.667 --> 30:50.500
But the guests are in luck,

30:50.533 --> 30:54.533
because Adrian
serves them duck.

30:54.567 --> 30:55.533
The end.

30:55.567 --> 30:57.667
- Bravo.
- Bravo.

30:57.700 --> 31:01.200
- Thank you, guys. Thank you.
- You have quite the crew,

31:01.233 --> 31:03.567
I have to say, Captain Lee.

31:03.600 --> 31:06.367
- Ashton, you nailed it.
- Did I?

31:06.400 --> 31:08.633
- I have goosebumps.
- Yes!

31:08.667 --> 31:10.266
- I will bid you all
good night.

31:10.300 --> 31:12.166
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

31:12.200 --> 31:14.266
- Yeah, I'm getting
----ing beat.

31:14.300 --> 31:16.400
- Good night.

31:16.433 --> 31:18.266
- Meet you in the bow.
- Yeah.

31:27.300 --> 31:28.266
- Don't put your feet
near there.

31:28.300 --> 31:29.533
- Is it dirty?

31:29.567 --> 31:30.667
- It's not dirty, but--
- Oily.

31:30.700 --> 31:32.266
- It's just--that's an anchor.

31:32.300 --> 31:33.533
If something breaks
or something,

31:33.567 --> 31:35.233
your foot
goes in there with it.

31:38.033 --> 31:39.333
- Right.

31:50.567 --> 31:53.333
I love having Ashton around,
considering everything

31:53.367 --> 31:55.300
I'm going through
with Kate and Josiah.

31:55.333 --> 31:56.633
He has a really good heart.

31:56.667 --> 31:58.500
I don't really know him
too well yet,

31:58.533 --> 32:00.600
but what I do know,
I really like,

32:00.633 --> 32:01.633
and he's adorable.

32:01.667 --> 32:03.266
- Let's go.

32:08.300 --> 32:09.734
[alarm blaring]

32:17.633 --> 32:19.633
- Let's get ready
for departure.

32:19.667 --> 32:21.467
- Ready, bow and anchor, Cap.
- Let's pull it up.

32:21.500 --> 32:22.700
- Copy that.
- Hi.

32:22.734 --> 32:24.667
Good morning. How are you?
- Good.

32:27.367 --> 32:29.033
- Oh, here. Scoot you over.

32:29.066 --> 32:30.533
- Hug it out?
- What did you say?

32:30.567 --> 32:33.700
- Hug it out?
- Come here.

32:33.734 --> 32:35.433
You all right?
Feeling better today?

32:35.467 --> 32:37.000
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

32:37.033 --> 32:38.734
I do have a soft spot
for Rhylee,

32:38.767 --> 32:40.767
'cause I know she means well.
I'm done with the attitude,

32:41.000 --> 32:43.066
but we've been through
a lot this season,

32:43.100 --> 32:45.467
and I'm just hoping
that I got through to her

32:45.500 --> 32:48.033
so that we can end the season
on a good note.

32:48.066 --> 32:51.433
- Tow line all the way out.
- We're out of here.

32:51.467 --> 32:54.367
- Don't drop it.

32:54.400 --> 32:56.033
- This is ham, cheese,
and mushroom crepe,

32:56.066 --> 32:58.467
and then there's Nutella
and banana crepes down there.

32:58.500 --> 32:59.667
- So I have to learn
how to make these?

32:59.700 --> 33:01.000
- Very good.

33:01.033 --> 33:02.734
- Wow.
- Yeah.

33:02.767 --> 33:05.667
- What are you doing up here?
- Watching that weather.

33:05.700 --> 33:07.533
- We need to get on land
and, like, explore.

33:07.567 --> 33:09.467
- I know.

33:09.500 --> 33:11.400
- I think it'd be cool to see
what the jungles are like.

33:11.433 --> 33:13.333
Yeah, I've got
feelings for Tyler.

33:13.367 --> 33:15.467
- There's got to be
some epic sh-- up there.

33:15.500 --> 33:18.567
- I feel like I've been able
to be myself more with Tyler

33:18.600 --> 33:20.567
than I have with anybody
on the boat.

33:20.600 --> 33:22.633
Maybe that's because
we had sex right away,

33:22.667 --> 33:25.567
and, damn it, Rhylee,
learn your lesson.

33:25.600 --> 33:28.333
- I'm gonna try to get
on a boat here.

33:28.367 --> 33:30.767
- There's a lot
of fishing boats too.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.734
- Eh.

33:32.767 --> 33:35.400
- I need radio silence
till we get to the dock.

33:38.567 --> 33:41.266
And drop.

33:41.300 --> 33:44.000
- Both lines off.
Pull 'em tight. Secure.

33:44.033 --> 33:45.633
- Copy that.

33:45.667 --> 33:48.633
I need all crew on the aft deck
in your whites ASAP.

33:48.667 --> 33:49.734
- Okay, copy that.

34:01.333 --> 34:04.467
- Oh, this is so sad.
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

34:04.500 --> 34:06.033
- Bye.
- Adrian.

34:06.066 --> 34:07.700
- My tan now.
- Absolutely.

34:07.734 --> 34:09.467
- Adrian.
- Bye.

34:09.500 --> 34:11.033
- I'm gonna miss you.

34:11.066 --> 34:13.600
It was a pleasure meeting you,
and thank you.

34:13.633 --> 34:16.133
- It's nice to have
a very interesting group.

34:16.166 --> 34:18.000
Let's call it that.

34:18.033 --> 34:19.667
- I want to hand
that over to you.

34:19.700 --> 34:22.300
You guys were fabulous,
each and every one of you.

34:22.333 --> 34:23.533
Thank you very much.

34:23.567 --> 34:24.567
- Adrian.

34:24.600 --> 34:26.066
[laughter]

34:28.500 --> 34:31.333
- Let's go to work.

34:31.367 --> 34:34.734
- All right, I'm gonna do
the beach club.

34:34.767 --> 34:37.500
- I'll rinse down here.
You start the bow.

34:37.533 --> 34:39.000
- Attention all crew,
attention all crew.

34:39.033 --> 34:41.567
I need everybody
in the crew mess in five.

34:47.100 --> 34:48.700
The little skit you guys
did last night

34:48.734 --> 34:51.033
I thought was hilarious.

34:51.066 --> 34:52.667
I am a little bit concerned

34:52.700 --> 34:57.567
that we may be starting
to lose focus.

34:57.600 --> 35:00.000
This is not a democracy.

35:00.033 --> 35:03.567
You don't get
a ----ing vote, period.

35:03.600 --> 35:05.667
I'm asking you to love
everybody that you work with.

35:05.700 --> 35:09.633
You don't have to, but if
everybody's doing their job,

35:09.667 --> 35:12.033
then nobody should have
any complaints.

35:12.066 --> 35:15.100
So there's no reason
that we can't pull together

35:15.133 --> 35:19.066
and end this
on a really strong finish.

35:19.100 --> 35:22.133
20 grand.

35:22.166 --> 35:23.767
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.633
- Thank you, sir.
- You as well.

35:25.667 --> 35:29.433
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Kate.

35:29.467 --> 35:31.633
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

35:31.667 --> 35:33.166
- Well, thanks, guys.

35:35.400 --> 35:37.500
- What are you wearing tonight?

35:40.734 --> 35:44.100
- [whispers]
The lights off.

35:44.133 --> 35:45.467
- You look cute.
Are you wearing that?

35:45.500 --> 35:46.633
- Yeah.
- I did my hair,

35:46.667 --> 35:50.033
and I had to glue down.

35:50.066 --> 35:51.767
- Shoes. Shirt. Pants.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.767
- I wonder how crazy
it's gonna get.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.700
- You know what?

35:55.734 --> 35:57.600
I'm not wearing ripped pants
tonight. That's weird.

35:57.633 --> 35:59.567
- What time is it now?
- I don't know.

35:59.600 --> 36:01.567
- Ah, sh--.
- What did you do?

36:01.600 --> 36:05.033
- This is way better.
- I literally just slept, guys.

36:05.066 --> 36:08.734
- Walk of shame. Walk of shame.
- We're never leaving on time.

36:08.767 --> 36:10.633
- Hey, boo boo.
- Hi.

36:10.667 --> 36:12.533
Are you excited for tonight?

36:15.533 --> 36:17.100
Anybody starts talking
to a girl, within two minutes,

36:17.133 --> 36:19.600
he's there grinding up on her.

36:19.633 --> 36:22.734
- Ew. I'm just a number?

36:22.767 --> 36:26.000
I'm a little unsettled
by Adrian's comment.

36:26.033 --> 36:28.133
I'm definitely not a girl that
just hooks up with random guys,

36:28.166 --> 36:29.767
and I'm definitely not a girl

36:30.000 --> 36:31.433
that's just
another notch on a guy's belt.

36:31.467 --> 36:33.200
I'm not into it.

36:33.233 --> 36:35.400
Stop putting sh--
in my head, Adrian.

36:35.433 --> 36:36.400
- What?

36:36.433 --> 36:39.166
- You're just miserable.

36:39.200 --> 36:40.767
- Coming up...

36:41.000 --> 36:42.433
- I've got to sit
on my rocking chair

36:42.467 --> 36:44.600
when I'm 75
with some ----ing stories.

36:50.767 --> 36:51.400
- All right, let's go.

36:51.400 --> 36:51.533
- All right, let's go.
- Ooh.

36:52.633 --> 36:54.200
It's chilly tonight, huh?

36:54.233 --> 36:55.500
- Here, let's go. I got you.

36:55.533 --> 36:57.266
- Oh, it's so--
- [snores]

36:57.300 --> 37:00.000
No! Wake up!

37:02.166 --> 37:04.000
Just--
all you gotta do is ask.

37:04.033 --> 37:07.100
- Nobody wants to hear that
the guy they're talking to

37:07.133 --> 37:08.600
is this massive player,

37:08.633 --> 37:11.233
but I'm hoping
that he proves me wrong.

37:16.633 --> 37:18.166
- At the same time.
- [laughs]

37:18.200 --> 37:21.033
- I saw a nipple.
- No, you didn't.

37:21.066 --> 37:25.200
- I'm having a sex-istential
crisis. I can go six weeks.

37:25.233 --> 37:26.734
- We can get out.
Let's go.

37:30.700 --> 37:33.300
- Our favorite place.
- I know!

37:33.333 --> 37:34.734
Let's go to the bar.

37:38.266 --> 37:39.667
- Why?

37:42.633 --> 37:44.133
- Hey.

37:47.066 --> 37:48.600
- Cheers!

37:48.633 --> 37:50.667
Cheers!

37:50.700 --> 37:53.200
- Let's go!

37:59.567 --> 38:01.767
- Oh!

38:24.667 --> 38:26.100
- I'm a bit confused.

38:26.133 --> 38:28.266
We've been on this good vibe,

38:28.300 --> 38:30.266
but now she's being
all cold towards me.

38:30.300 --> 38:33.233
It's definitely not gonna stop
me from having a good time.

38:33.266 --> 38:36.000
I'm gonna wingman you, and
we're gonna scope some ladies.

38:42.700 --> 38:44.266
- I have one speed
when I go out,

38:44.300 --> 38:48.133
and it's, like, 200%.

38:48.166 --> 38:50.567
I'm young. I've got to sit
on my rocking chair

38:50.600 --> 38:53.100
when I'm 75 with some
----ing stories.

38:54.200 --> 38:55.667
- [screams]

39:07.100 --> 39:09.667
We're not in a relationship,
so, of course,

39:09.700 --> 39:11.667
like, I can't hold him
to any standard.

39:11.700 --> 39:15.033
I don't think he thinks
about intentions.

39:15.066 --> 39:16.333
I think he's thinking
with his dick.

39:37.133 --> 39:39.333
Have a ball of a time.
Have all the fun you want,

39:39.367 --> 39:42.734
but don't hold my hand
an hour or two prior

39:42.767 --> 39:46.100
and then go start dancing
with all of these other girls.

39:46.133 --> 39:48.200
It's just rude.

39:52.433 --> 39:55.667
- Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

39:55.700 --> 39:57.233
- I have to pee.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.734
- Get in the van.

40:02.500 --> 40:04.000
- [laughs]

40:04.033 --> 40:07.100
- Ash and Tyler,
I noticed you guys

40:07.133 --> 40:10.700
did not hold back going after
that local Tahitian--

40:10.734 --> 40:13.433
- No, I set Tyler up
with a local.

40:13.467 --> 40:17.467
- I'm gonna chalk it up
to drunken brotherhood.

40:17.500 --> 40:19.467
Oh, I got to pee.
Oh, don't push on me.

40:19.500 --> 40:21.100
- Don't be a (BLEEP).

40:21.133 --> 40:23.233
- Thank you.
Are you gonna carry me?

40:23.266 --> 40:26.166
- Oh, my goodness.
Everyone come home. Come on.

40:27.333 --> 40:29.367
- Uh-oh.

40:29.400 --> 40:31.400
- Rossy.

40:31.433 --> 40:33.066
Ugh.

40:39.266 --> 40:41.166
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:41.200 --> 40:43.333
What the hell do you
want to talk about?

40:43.367 --> 40:45.333
You drunken ----ing fool.

40:47.400 --> 40:49.266
- It's not like I forgive him.

40:49.300 --> 40:52.333
It's just, I'm in the mood
for sex right now,

40:52.367 --> 40:55.367
so this time,
Tyler gets a pass.

41:00.133 --> 41:01.133
- No, no.

41:01.166 --> 41:04.533
- Really?
- Really what?

41:04.567 --> 41:07.100
Like, what's--
what's upset you?

41:07.133 --> 41:11.066
- Nothing's upset me,
but I don't, like...

41:15.033 --> 41:16.166
Nothing's upset me.

41:16.200 --> 41:18.233
Am I pissed off?
Yeah.

41:18.266 --> 41:19.500
Obviously, I care.

41:19.533 --> 41:21.233
I thought you respected me.

41:21.266 --> 41:22.734
I thought that we established
a connection.

41:27.166 --> 41:29.333
- Ashton, I didn't
see you all night.

41:32.033 --> 41:33.400
As soon as we got
to the club,

41:33.433 --> 41:34.767
you were dancing
with other girls all night.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.467
And that's fine, babe,

41:36.500 --> 41:39.300
but, like, I'm not gonna be
a tally on your checklist.

41:49.400 --> 41:52.300
- So that's all good,
but you've laid your bed,

41:52.333 --> 41:55.333
and you've made your bed,
so you're gonna go sleep in it.

41:57.467 --> 42:00.133
- Before we went out,
Adrian started telling me,

42:00.166 --> 42:02.200
"Oh, yeah, Ashton's hooked up
with, like,

42:02.233 --> 42:04.266
"a couple girls
before you arrived,

42:04.300 --> 42:06.266
da, da, da, da, da."

42:06.300 --> 42:10.367
Did I hook up with anybody?
If you saw the way that I was--

42:10.400 --> 42:12.133
- If you're not gonna listen
to what I'm saying,

42:12.166 --> 42:15.233
then I'm just gonna walk away,
because I'm just, like--

42:15.266 --> 42:17.000
- Okay, okay. You know what?
Let's end it. That's cool.

42:17.033 --> 42:19.166
- Yeah, yeah. This is stupid.
This is stupid,

42:19.200 --> 42:20.300
'cause you're not
even listening,

42:20.333 --> 42:22.000
and you're ----ing wasted,

42:22.033 --> 42:24.066
and this is just
a stupid conversation.

42:28.367 --> 42:29.367
- Next on "Below Deck"...

42:29.400 --> 42:31.033
- Charley Walters.

42:31.066 --> 42:33.200
Group has requested
an all-gold party.

42:33.233 --> 42:36.300
- Holy sh--, is that real?
Damn.

42:36.333 --> 42:38.066
- You're making me embarrassed.

42:43.233 --> 42:44.300
- Can I get
a sparkling water please?

42:44.333 --> 42:46.200
- Can we get six tequila shots?

42:46.233 --> 42:48.133
- Kate, when's the main course
being served?

42:48.166 --> 42:52.200
- Kate, serve them real food.
- They're being extra extra.

42:52.233 --> 42:54.500
- Oh, God.

42:54.533 --> 42:56.200
Man down off the Jet Ski.

42:56.233 --> 42:57.500
- Oh, sh--.

42:57.533 --> 42:59.467
- Ross, can you see Billy
in the water?

42:59.500 --> 43:03.233
- What the (BLEEP) is going on?
Cut the lines loose.

43:03.266 --> 43:06.266
