00:05.250 --> 00:06.417
<i>Previously on X Company...</i>

00:06.458 --> 00:08.208
- I need you to be Alfred's
spotter.

00:08.250 --> 00:09.625
- That special, is he?

00:09.667 --> 00:11.041
- Franz, what happened in
Terre-du-Fils?

00:11.083 --> 00:14.083
<i>- I executed 68 innocent men.</i>

00:14.125 --> 00:16.250
I believed I had to.

00:16.291 --> 00:19.625
<i>- That's the man we</i>
<i>have to target. We've</i>
<i>got to find the scrap of a soul</i>

00:19.667 --> 00:22.875
<i>that's left in there</i>
<i>after everything he's done.</i>

00:25.959 --> 00:28.000
- Tom! Tom!

00:28.041 --> 00:30.333
No, no...

00:32.250 --> 00:34.792
- What happened?
- You'd have been so proud.

00:37.458 --> 00:39.917
- What would you say if
I told you that today you had

00:39.959 --> 00:41.834
an opportunity
to serve your country?

00:41.875 --> 00:43.583
There's a canvas
detonator inside.

00:43.625 --> 00:46.208
Snapping it in half
pulls the canvas.

00:46.250 --> 00:48.291
Four seconds later,
it's over.

00:48.333 --> 00:51.250
- Klaus! What are you doing?

00:51.291 --> 00:52.250
- Kristina!

00:54.583 --> 00:56.583
- When you said my name,
what did it feel like?

00:57.959 --> 00:59.583
- Where's Miri?
- The last I saw her,

00:59.625 --> 01:01.417
<i>she was picking off</i>
<i>Germans from a church tower.</i>

01:03.667 --> 01:05.750
<i>- Don't move.</i>

01:05.792 --> 01:08.834
Then we're both good as dead.

01:08.875 --> 01:10.208
I don't care.

01:10.250 --> 01:13.000
Your friendship with this woman
is going to cost us.

01:14.750 --> 01:16.375
It's over between us.

01:20.834 --> 01:23.583
- Why are you here?
- I'm here for my son.

01:25.792 --> 01:27.583
- Tell me what it is
you want me to do.

01:36.375 --> 01:38.542
-: Yah!

01:48.792 --> 01:51.583
- Creon has landed!
- How was your flight?

01:51.625 --> 01:54.542
- How good is this safe house?
- It's good. The head

01:54.583 --> 01:56.667
administrator's pro-Resistance.
- Easy to say.

01:56.709 --> 01:59.375
- He's been patching up our boys
since the Germans hit Paris.

01:59.417 --> 02:01.250
He's on our side.
- Are you sure?

02:01.291 --> 02:04.291
- We're sure. This--
the whole wing is ours.

02:04.333 --> 02:06.917
- It's the new
Tuberculosis Ward, so...

02:06.959 --> 02:09.959
nobody wants to come close.
- It's a good idea.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.667
- It was Tom's.

02:18.208 --> 02:20.208
- Where's Neil?

02:25.417 --> 02:27.875
- Oh...

02:39.959 --> 02:42.458
Hello?

02:45.834 --> 02:47.709
You're looking
for someone?

02:47.750 --> 02:50.375
- A young woman.
Long dark hair.

02:50.417 --> 02:52.458
A black shirt.
The Germans had her.

02:52.500 --> 02:54.667
- One of the prisoners.
- You saw them?

02:54.709 --> 02:57.542
-: They stopped
at my farm. Took our food.

02:57.583 --> 02:59.917
They were taking them north.
- You know where?

02:59.959 --> 03:01.959
- No.
- When?

03:02.000 --> 03:04.083
- A few hours ago.

03:14.750 --> 03:16.750
- We're picking up Faber
in about 20 minutes.

03:16.792 --> 03:18.709
- And his wife?
- He wants to keep her out of
it.

03:18.750 --> 03:20.750
- Out of the question.
- It was his condition.

03:20.792 --> 03:22.917
- She's a civilian, she knows
too much, she needs to
understand what

03:22.959 --> 03:25.542
it means to keep her mouth shut.
- That's gonna provoke him.

03:25.583 --> 03:28.000
- Irrelevant. If we get him
here and secure, you go and get
her.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.625
- Understood.

03:30.667 --> 03:33.291
- Where have you been?

03:33.333 --> 03:35.041
- We lost one of our recruits.
- Miri.

03:35.083 --> 03:38.083
- The Roma girl.
- She was taken prisoner at
Dieppe.

03:38.125 --> 03:40.375
I think I know where she is.
- It's not our priority.

03:40.417 --> 03:44.667
- She's the reason I'm alive.
- We're about to land one of the
biggest assets we've ever had.

03:44.709 --> 03:47.000
- She'll disappear. She'll be
shot, you know what they do.

03:47.041 --> 03:49.500
- She know about this
safe house?
- No.

03:49.542 --> 03:52.208
- No reason to go after her.
- Just like that?

03:52.250 --> 03:54.875
- I'm not risking any one of my
agents who know what you know.

03:54.917 --> 03:57.417
- Which is what?
- That an Oberfuhrer is
willing to work for the Allies.

03:57.458 --> 03:59.792
- Or it could just be
the first move in a long con.

03:59.834 --> 04:04.000
It could. But sometimes the only
way to know the truth

04:04.041 --> 04:05.500
<i>is to look a man in the eye.</i>

04:07.750 --> 04:12.542
- When you are finished those,
sir, I'll make sure they get to
Oberfuhrer Fisher's office.

04:12.583 --> 04:15.417
- You'll find things need to
move much faster now.

04:18.583 --> 04:20.709
- You'll get
used to it.

04:20.750 --> 04:23.125
- Your signature, sir.

04:23.166 --> 04:24.959
- What is this?

04:25.000 --> 04:26.792
- A troop requisition
for Oberfuhrer Fischer.

04:26.834 --> 04:29.125
- What is the operation?
- A student group

04:29.166 --> 04:31.959
suspected of crimes
against the state.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.959
- Don't worry
about the details.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.792
Trust your staff.
That's what they're for.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.166
How does it feel?

04:45.208 --> 04:47.417
- You're right, everything
takes getting used to.

04:47.458 --> 04:49.792
- Do it quickly.
I'm leaving for Berlin.

04:49.834 --> 04:52.667
- Today?
- Tomorrow morning.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.917
You think I'd miss your
celebration this evening?

04:54.959 --> 04:56.750
- Of course.

04:56.792 --> 04:58.667
- Your wife must be looking
forward to it.

04:58.709 --> 05:00.625
It is a promotion
for her as well, isn't it?

05:00.667 --> 05:03.041
- For you.

05:05.291 --> 05:08.458
- Really, Franz.
You don't look well.

05:08.500 --> 05:12.041
You should pace yourself.

05:12.083 --> 05:15.583
- The war will end soon enough.
- Bring your boss a coffee.

05:15.625 --> 05:19.750
And make sure he's at his desk
at five, feeling sharp.

05:19.792 --> 05:21.625
- I'm expecting
a telephone call.

05:22.667 --> 05:24.542
- You didn't tell him?

05:24.583 --> 05:27.125
It is a call
of congratulations

05:27.166 --> 05:30.917
you won't want to miss.
- Yes, sir.

05:49.208 --> 05:51.333
- Our latest recruit.

05:51.375 --> 05:53.125
- A lot of blank spots.

05:53.166 --> 05:55.041
- Hopefully not for long.
Franz Faber's family?

05:55.083 --> 05:57.875
- We have his mother and father.
- Farmers, right?

05:57.917 --> 05:59.250
- Both deceased.
- Wife's side?

05:59.291 --> 06:01.041
- Schmidt.

06:01.083 --> 06:03.875
- German for Smith?
That oughta narrow it down.

06:03.917 --> 06:07.083
Keep at it. Get creative.
Anything we can use
for added leverage.

06:07.125 --> 06:10.083
- Where're you going?
- I'm going to get a drink.

06:43.291 --> 06:46.041
- Women's entrance
is around the corner.

06:46.083 --> 06:49.083
- You want me to go outside
and come back in again?

06:51.375 --> 06:54.542
- What'll it be?
- Rye and ginger..?

06:54.583 --> 06:57.500
- Is that a question?

06:57.542 --> 07:00.291
- OK...
- Rye and ginger.

07:06.083 --> 07:09.125
- So... how's your day so far?

07:09.166 --> 07:11.959
- Already looking up, thanks.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.875
- Glad to help.

07:14.917 --> 07:17.625
Come on, don't tell me
you're here on your own?

07:17.667 --> 07:20.583
- Today, I am.

07:20.625 --> 07:22.583
- Where's the lucky man?

07:22.625 --> 07:25.291
In the service?

07:25.333 --> 07:28.542
- Was.

07:31.208 --> 07:34.667
Killed in action,
some... beach in France.

07:34.709 --> 07:37.041
Some place that has
nothing to do with us.

07:43.375 --> 07:45.750
- Stay quiet.

07:45.792 --> 07:47.917
- What do you think
you're doing?

07:47.959 --> 07:50.834
- Being cautious.
Belt and holster.

07:50.875 --> 07:52.709
You can't be seen in uniform.

07:56.750 --> 07:58.917
- Do not mistake this
for the tables being turned.

07:58.959 --> 08:02.041
- Just get in the chair.

08:04.667 --> 08:07.166
- His mother
was devastated.

08:07.208 --> 08:10.000
There was nothing I could say.
- A bit early, eh?

08:10.041 --> 08:14.458
What the hell,
I will have a... beer.

08:17.917 --> 08:20.083
Beer, please?

08:28.041 --> 08:31.458
You're not gonna
tell, are you?

08:33.833 --> 08:36.082
- Ahh...

08:36.125 --> 08:38.250
Busy day?

08:41.958 --> 08:45.834
I... saw you walking down
the other side of the street

08:45.875 --> 08:48.208
and, uh...

08:48.250 --> 08:50.166
...don't get me wrong, this
isn't something I usually do,

08:50.208 --> 08:54.291
but can I buy you a drink?
- I'm doing just fine.

08:54.333 --> 08:57.917
- Hm! I'm Aaron Berkman.

08:59.834 --> 09:03.041
Not gonna tell me your name?
- You know what, pal?

09:03.083 --> 09:06.959
There's plenty of tables.
- You got a problem with me?

09:07.000 --> 09:09.709
- Maybe you should double
the hell back out of my bar.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
This is us telling you
the nice way.

09:19.166 --> 09:21.875
-: Ahem!

09:28.750 --> 09:30.750
- Goddamned Jews!

09:47.083 --> 09:49.667
- There had better be
an excellent reason.

09:49.709 --> 09:51.709
- Someone we wanted you to meet.
- Franz Faber!

09:54.667 --> 09:57.291
I'm Duncan Sinclair.

10:03.458 --> 10:05.041
You're surprised to see me.

10:05.083 --> 10:07.000
Should I know who you are?

10:07.041 --> 10:09.583
You had my photograph
in your office safe.

10:09.625 --> 10:11.667
You sent a man to try to kill me

10:11.709 --> 10:14.750
and sabotage my communications.

10:14.792 --> 10:19.458
- How is he?
- Has he not reported in?

10:19.500 --> 10:22.375
- Why are you here?

10:24.291 --> 10:27.000
Someone of <i> your <span style="bodyStyle"> rank behind</i>
enemy lines, is that wise?

10:27.041 --> 10:29.417
- Is it wise that
someone of your rank...

10:29.458 --> 10:32.208
is offering to work
for the Allies?

10:32.250 --> 10:35.000
- This was not
the protocol.

10:35.041 --> 10:36.959
- Change of plan
for my security.

10:37.000 --> 10:42.125
I need to know
if I can trust you.
- That goes both ways.

10:42.166 --> 10:43.291
- How does your wife feel

10:43.333 --> 10:45.542
about you working
for the Allies?

10:45.583 --> 10:48.083
I assume you told her?
- Yes.

10:48.125 --> 10:53.625
She knows.
- Good. Alfred and
Aurora are bringing her in.

10:53.667 --> 10:54.792
- That's not
the deal we made.

10:54.834 --> 10:57.125
- All due respect to my team,

10:57.166 --> 10:59.709
I'm the one
making the deal today.

10:59.750 --> 11:02.834
- She will be kept out of this.
- She's already in it.

11:02.875 --> 11:04.750
She knows that
you came to us.

11:04.792 --> 11:07.041
She'd be considered a traitor
for not reporting you. She's

11:07.083 --> 11:10.458
a risk to herself, and to us if
she makes a single false move.

11:10.500 --> 11:13.166
- You will not contact her.

11:13.208 --> 11:16.750
- It's too late.

11:16.792 --> 11:18.000
Is there something

11:18.041 --> 11:20.875
that you're not telling me?

11:32.834 --> 11:35.250
-: She's not
at the park or the church.

11:35.291 --> 11:38.083
- The cafÃ©?

11:42.542 --> 11:45.875
She... could
be inside.

11:45.917 --> 11:48.333
- Then, why won't she
answer the telephone?

11:48.375 --> 11:52.083
This doesn't feel right.

11:52.125 --> 11:55.500
- Hey. Sinclair
brought chocolate.

11:55.542 --> 11:57.250
Wanna go halves?

11:57.291 --> 11:59.917
- Are you twelve?
You know what that's for.

11:59.959 --> 12:01.625
- Yes, I know what it's for.
- It's for battering.

12:01.667 --> 12:04.041
for favours.
- I know!

12:04.083 --> 12:07.250
Just tryin'a...
take your mind off things.

12:07.291 --> 12:10.542
- I was this close.
She could be anywhere now.

12:10.583 --> 12:12.375
- She's strong.

12:12.417 --> 12:14.291
We'll get to her
when we can.

12:14.333 --> 12:16.041
- Because she's not
useful right now.

12:16.083 --> 12:18.875
Not as important
as we are.

12:18.917 --> 12:21.125
Not as important
as that Nazi in there.

12:21.166 --> 12:24.166
Just another life.
Got to keep your eye
on that bloody big picture.

12:24.208 --> 12:26.000
- It's not what
I was saying.

12:28.417 --> 12:30.417
I bet he'd know
where she's being taken.

12:38.583 --> 12:41.709
- Madame...
stop, please.

12:41.750 --> 12:43.917
- Good morning!

12:43.959 --> 12:46.041
I am here to see
Sabine Faber.

12:46.083 --> 12:48.166
- I'm sorry, but
I can't let you in.

12:50.959 --> 12:53.834
You know me.
I'm Helene Bauer.

12:53.875 --> 12:56.208
I was here with her
just last week.

12:58.542 --> 13:00.417
She was due to meet me

13:00.458 --> 13:02.667
at the cafe over an hour ago.
Now she's not answering

13:02.709 --> 13:06.125
the telephone so I'm
worried that something
might have happened to her.

13:06.166 --> 13:08.458
May I please just
go up and check on her?

13:08.500 --> 13:11.000
- I'm afraid not.

13:13.250 --> 13:15.583
- What is your name, sir?

13:15.625 --> 13:18.041
- Sturmmann Graff.
- I will make sure

13:18.083 --> 13:21.500
to mention you to the Oberfuhrer
next time I see him.

13:23.417 --> 13:25.375
- Frau Faber

13:25.417 --> 13:27.125
is not at
home today.

13:27.166 --> 13:29.625
- Well, you might
have mentioned that.

13:29.667 --> 13:32.750
Then, where is she?
- I couldn't say.

13:32.792 --> 13:35.000
- Couldn't?
Is that professional

13:35.041 --> 13:37.083
discretion or
just pure ignorance?

13:37.125 --> 13:40.208
- Discretion, Frau
Bauer. Generally--

13:40.250 --> 13:43.542
- Discretion is for strangers
or unwelcomed guests.

13:43.583 --> 13:45.542
I'm neither.

13:45.583 --> 13:48.625
Where is she?

13:48.667 --> 13:51.041
- I shouldn't be here,
I should really get back.

13:51.083 --> 13:53.667
- Who says?
-: Yeah...

13:53.709 --> 13:57.083
Yeah, who says?
Crummy job anyway.

13:57.125 --> 13:58.834
Boss gets all the glamour,
takes all the credit.

13:58.875 --> 14:01.208
- And that is why
I'm my own boss.

14:01.250 --> 14:04.208
- Hm... smart.

14:04.250 --> 14:07.417
- Everybody in this country
always tells you what to do.

14:07.458 --> 14:10.917
I think the least we can do
is choose how to spend our days.

14:10.959 --> 14:14.291
- Yeah...

14:14.333 --> 14:17.125
I told him not to sign up.

14:17.166 --> 14:20.125
I mean, what have
the Germans ever done to us?

14:20.166 --> 14:22.166
We're sending decent

14:22.208 --> 14:24.291
Canadian citizens over there
to die on their beaches

14:24.333 --> 14:27.333
for nothing. It's not
like we stand a chance.

14:29.709 --> 14:31.667
Sorry... I shouldn't.

14:31.709 --> 14:34.500
It's the...
it's the rye talking.

14:34.542 --> 14:37.000
- Well, it's
common sense.

14:37.041 --> 14:40.625
The sooner the Germans get it
done, the more lives we save.

14:40.667 --> 14:43.959
- Most people
don't see it that way.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.959
- We aren't "most people" here.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.041
You can speak
freely at my bar.

14:48.083 --> 14:51.041
I consider it my patriotic
duty to defend that freedom.

14:51.083 --> 14:53.458
-:
Hear, hear! Cheers!

14:53.500 --> 14:56.083
- Well... sign me up, boys!

14:56.125 --> 14:59.041
So...

14:59.083 --> 15:01.208
is this a club?

15:01.250 --> 15:04.083
What do you do,
get together and talk freely?

15:04.125 --> 15:06.333
- You think we're all talk?
- I dunno...

15:06.375 --> 15:09.125
you tell me.

15:09.166 --> 15:12.166
- Maybe I'll show you.

15:16.834 --> 15:18.792
- Sorry about the mess.

15:18.834 --> 15:22.166
- You don't see
many of these anymore,
not in this neck of the woods.

15:22.208 --> 15:24.792
- No, you don't!
- You play?

15:24.834 --> 15:27.959
- Never thrown a ball
in my life.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.500
But I have
swung a bat.

15:30.542 --> 15:33.333
Christie Pits,
back in '33?

15:33.375 --> 15:35.458
You're probably
too young to remember.

15:35.500 --> 15:39.333
- Nope. My Dad
was in on that fight.

15:39.375 --> 15:42.333
I wanted to go. See the yids
get what's coming to them,

15:42.375 --> 15:45.333
but...

15:45.375 --> 15:47.917
he wouldn't let me.

15:47.959 --> 15:50.792
- It was quite a night.

15:50.834 --> 15:53.291
Last time we got
to carry that flag.

15:53.333 --> 15:56.041
In public anyway.
- I heard

15:56.083 --> 15:58.750
about that group,
down in the Beaches.

15:58.792 --> 16:00.583
The Swastika Club?

16:00.625 --> 16:05.375
Yeah. We were just good citizens
trying to keep things clean.

16:05.417 --> 16:08.000
- And now?
- Now, I put

16:08.041 --> 16:10.250
like-minded people
in touch with each other.

16:10.291 --> 16:14.083
- Like-minded?
- There's ways we
can do our part from here.

16:14.125 --> 16:16.041
- Help the Germans
get it done?

16:16.083 --> 16:19.417
- Hm... we speak
the same language.

16:22.875 --> 16:25.750
Ah! Ah! Ah.

16:25.792 --> 16:28.208
- Don't make me
hurt you.

16:28.250 --> 16:31.583
- I won't be dragged from my
office in the middle of the day.

16:31.625 --> 16:34.375
- Fair enough.

16:34.417 --> 16:36.375
- There's a library across
from my office, third floor.

16:36.417 --> 16:39.000
Hang a yellow sash on
the curtain instead of blue.

16:39.041 --> 16:41.291
I will return the signal.
- Let's just make sure

16:41.333 --> 16:44.083
that we have
an understanding here first.

16:44.125 --> 16:47.834
- I've asked your team before,
what is it you want me to do?

16:47.875 --> 16:51.083
- I want you to help build
Aurora's cover as Helene Bauer.

16:51.125 --> 16:54.041
- Go on.

16:54.083 --> 16:57.291
- She'll be your
handler, she'll provide
you with regular instruction.

16:57.333 --> 17:00.667
- I see.
Anything else?

17:00.709 --> 17:02.959
- I want a list

17:03.000 --> 17:05.333
of every informant
in the area,

17:05.375 --> 17:08.040
specifically those trying to
infiltrate Resistance cells.

17:08.083 --> 17:10.541
- This is not what we agreed.
- This is what it looks like

17:10.583 --> 17:13.165
to be a double agent.
- You know why I'm here.

17:13.208 --> 17:17.125
To mitigate the excesses,
the liquidation of
unworthy citizens.

17:17.165 --> 17:20.000
- Aurora told me about your son.
- Then you know what I'm asking.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.375
- The death camps.

17:22.416 --> 17:25.165
We feel the same way,

17:25.208 --> 17:28.500
but that is not a battle
we can win by bombing.

17:28.541 --> 17:30.542
Our best bet...

17:30.583 --> 17:33.125
is to wipe out the disease.

17:33.166 --> 17:35.125
- The Reich.

17:35.166 --> 17:37.125
- Win the war.

17:37.166 --> 17:39.959
- You'll never win. You saw
what happened in Dieppe.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.125
- Sabine left your apartment
two nights ago

17:43.166 --> 17:45.959
with luggage and
she hasn't been seen since.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.583
- What happened?

17:50.625 --> 17:52.834
- Answer the question.

17:54.834 --> 17:58.250
- What happened was I told her
I was gonna work with you.

17:58.291 --> 18:02.083
- So when you came to us,
she didn't already know?

18:02.125 --> 18:04.917
- I hadn't told her before, no.
It was for her own safety.

18:04.959 --> 18:07.625
Then...

18:07.667 --> 18:09.667
it became unavoidable.

18:09.709 --> 18:11.667
I didn't think she'd
react the way she did.

18:11.709 --> 18:14.333
- Which was how?

18:14.375 --> 18:17.041
- She said that I was
out of my mind.

18:17.083 --> 18:19.250
She said...

18:19.291 --> 18:22.208
"I can't do this."

18:22.250 --> 18:24.875
- Can't do what?

18:24.917 --> 18:27.500
- Live here?
Stay married?

18:27.542 --> 18:30.041
Betray Germany?

18:30.083 --> 18:34.083
- Where is she, Franz?

18:36.375 --> 18:38.542
- I have no idea.

18:45.083 --> 18:48.000
- Two days. She could've
gone anywhere in two days.

18:48.041 --> 18:50.166
- That's the problem.
- So she's gone and we have

18:50.208 --> 18:51.750
no idea where our loyalties are.

18:51.792 --> 18:54.375
- That's why we need to find her
fast, assuming she's in Paris.

18:54.417 --> 18:57.166
- He's got agents everywhere.
Why can't he track her down?

18:57.208 --> 18:58.500
- No, that's the last thing
he should do.

18:58.542 --> 19:00.166
He needs to keep
this as quiet as possible.

19:00.208 --> 19:02.917
- Contact the camp,
mobilize our Paris agents,

19:02.959 --> 19:04.792
check anywhere
she might have been seen.

19:04.834 --> 19:08.166
- Metro, train stations...
- Bus depots and hotels.

19:08.208 --> 19:10.166
- Could she have
gone to a friend?

19:10.208 --> 19:12.041
I was all she had

19:12.083 --> 19:14.667
- I swear on my life,
I've never seen that man before.

19:14.709 --> 19:16.750
I don't know anything about him.
- He's a German agent,

19:16.792 --> 19:19.750
he worked with the Royal Care
Society, made regular visits

19:19.792 --> 19:21.792
to a German POW camp
in Bowmanville.

19:21.834 --> 19:23.875
Twelve days ago he failed
to show up for work

19:23.917 --> 19:26.875
after committing an act
of treason. Where is he?

19:26.917 --> 19:29.166
- How would I know
if I've never seen him?

19:32.000 --> 19:33.917
You can't do this.
I know my rights!

19:33.959 --> 19:36.083
- You can yell as loud as
you want. We've rounded up

19:36.125 --> 19:38.375
your rats. We've got
a dozen soldiers outside.

19:38.417 --> 19:40.000
- You're lying.
- You've already confessed

19:40.041 --> 19:43.208
to high treason, punishment
is severe. Help us help you!

19:43.250 --> 19:46.166
Yes or no?

19:46.208 --> 19:49.041
- AH!
- This is me

19:49.083 --> 19:52.291
asking you in the nice way.

19:52.333 --> 19:55.041
- ALRIGHT!

19:57.208 --> 19:59.959
I've never seen him.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.875
A couple of times,
I've done a guy a favour.

20:03.917 --> 20:06.417
He comes in here...

20:06.458 --> 20:09.208
with an envelope or something
and I stash it in a church

20:09.250 --> 20:11.500
and I call another guy
and let him know it's there.

20:11.542 --> 20:13.291
- Go on.

20:13.333 --> 20:16.417
- About two weeks ago,
I had to leave an envelope...

20:16.458 --> 20:19.333
with a letter to a POW.

20:19.375 --> 20:21.583
- Call him...
let him know

20:21.625 --> 20:24.166
you have another package for
him, he needs to get it today.

20:24.208 --> 20:26.750
If you give him a distress
signal and he doesn't show up

20:26.792 --> 20:29.542
at the church, my colleague
gets the last word with you.

20:32.208 --> 20:34.458
- We need to bring
your wife into line.

20:34.500 --> 20:35.959
- I will not have her
put at risk.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
- You want to help us,
this is the first step.

20:38.041 --> 20:40.166
We are all at risk
without Sabine on our side.

20:44.208 --> 20:47.125
- Sir, we have the text for
the transmission to the Camp.

20:47.166 --> 20:50.583
I need you to check it.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.625
- Neil, watch him.

21:12.125 --> 21:14.750
- You don't know where she is...

21:14.792 --> 21:17.500
or even if she's safe.

21:20.583 --> 21:23.542
I have the same problem.

21:23.583 --> 21:25.583
- The Gypsy?

21:27.709 --> 21:29.000
- You know?

21:29.041 --> 21:31.125
My informant at Varages

21:31.166 --> 21:33.667
said the English guerrilla
leader had a Gypsy girlfriend.

21:33.709 --> 21:36.792
A sharpshooter, Miri.

21:36.834 --> 21:39.166
- Keep talking.

21:39.208 --> 21:41.250
- A woman of that description
was recently arrested

21:41.291 --> 21:44.000
for shooting soldiers
from a bell tower in Dieppe.

21:46.208 --> 21:49.417
- Where is she?
Is she alive?

21:49.458 --> 21:53.166
- As far as I know.
- Where was she taken?

21:53.208 --> 21:54.959
Tell me where she is.

21:56.542 --> 21:57.375
Please.

22:08.583 --> 22:11.542
- What are you
thinking about?

22:11.583 --> 22:15.208
- Dieppe. You.

22:15.250 --> 22:18.959
Standing on top
of that tank on fire.

22:21.083 --> 22:24.250
The tank, I mean. Not you.

22:24.291 --> 22:27.375
-: The best
part of that was the view.

22:27.417 --> 22:32.000
Seeing that jeep at the far end
of the field carrying you back.

22:32.041 --> 22:35.500
And you...

22:35.542 --> 22:38.208
you get to relive
those moments, you get to...

22:38.250 --> 22:40.875
see them, to smell them.
- It's as real

22:40.917 --> 22:43.667
as the present, every time.

22:43.709 --> 22:45.667
- Hm... so,

22:45.709 --> 22:49.291
when you were
a little boy,

22:49.333 --> 22:51.417
you could spend
a whole day inside...

22:51.458 --> 22:54.917
the memory of the first time
you tasted ice cream?

22:54.959 --> 22:57.208
- I still can.

22:57.250 --> 23:00.792
Any first taste.

23:08.291 --> 23:10.792
- We don't have to talk
about what happened.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.959
But I wouldn't mind
if it happened again.

23:21.542 --> 23:23.959
- Early Bird.
The camp says to meet

23:24.000 --> 23:25.792
at the usual place. Password
is Early Bird. Anyone

23:25.834 --> 23:28.000
in Paris with news of Sabine's
whereabouts will call in.

23:28.041 --> 23:29.500
- Good, I'll go.

23:30.250 --> 23:33.291
- Harry, watch him.

23:33.333 --> 23:35.583
- Neil.

23:35.625 --> 23:39.792
Neil!

23:39.834 --> 23:41.625
What the hell's going on?

23:41.667 --> 23:44.041
- I told him where he might
find his friend, Miri.

23:44.083 --> 23:46.333
- You did what?

23:46.375 --> 23:48.792
She was probably transported
along with the other

23:48.834 --> 23:51.083
Dieppe insurgents
to a holding station

23:51.125 --> 23:54.083
near Val-des-Plaines,
just north of Paris.

23:54.125 --> 23:55.917
- Harry, bring him back.

23:55.959 --> 23:58.542
- Neil! Neil!
- Go back, Harry.

23:58.583 --> 24:01.000
- Don't do this.
Sinclair's orders!

24:01.041 --> 24:03.625
Even if you could
find the holding station...

24:03.667 --> 24:05.834
even if she's still
there, still alive,

24:05.875 --> 24:08.000
what are you going to do, huh?
What, you're going to break her

24:08.041 --> 24:10.041
out on your own? Get yourself
arrested? Get yourself killed?

24:10.083 --> 24:12.875
I'm not going to let you do
that. I can't let you--

24:12.917 --> 24:14.500
- Are you finished,
will you shut your mouth?

24:14.542 --> 24:16.542
- No, I'm not gonna shut
my mouth. You can't do this.

24:16.583 --> 24:19.125
- All those bodies,
all those boys on the beach,

24:19.166 --> 24:22.166
they were following
orders, and for what?

24:22.208 --> 24:25.041
There is no
"for what" anymore.

24:25.083 --> 24:28.291
It's "for who",
that's all we have left.

24:28.333 --> 24:31.083
I have to see her,
I have to.

24:31.125 --> 24:33.500
We didn't get
to say goodbye.

24:35.417 --> 24:37.917
Are you still
standing in my way?

24:50.208 --> 24:52.959
- Hey!

24:53.000 --> 24:55.583
HEY! Get out.

24:55.625 --> 24:59.333
Now! Go!
- OK!

25:13.458 --> 25:16.500
- Get in!

25:16.542 --> 25:18.542
- This is the best
you could do?

25:20.625 --> 25:22.500
Move over.

25:22.542 --> 25:25.125
Go on!

25:46.375 --> 25:48.375
- This is Early Bird.
-

25:48.417 --> 25:50.834
Renier confirms a friend
checked in yesterday morning.

25:50.875 --> 25:53.083
- Is she still there?
-

25:53.125 --> 25:55.750
- Thank you.

25:55.792 --> 25:57.792
<i>- Your agent Neil asked me</i>

25:57.834 --> 26:00.125
a question, I answered.
A test if you like.

26:00.166 --> 26:02.291
- A test?
- To know who I'm dealing with.

26:02.333 --> 26:03.959
- Now is not the time.
This is not your business.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.208
- I came here last week
with an offer to assist you--

26:06.250 --> 26:09.208
- That's right: <i> you <span style="bodyStyle"> came to<i> us.</i>
- That was before

26:09.250 --> 26:11.291
my decision
cost me my wife.

26:11.333 --> 26:13.333
Before you dragged me through
the streets in a wheelchair

26:13.375 --> 26:15.250
thinking that I will be
your errand boy, give you

26:15.291 --> 26:17.959
unlimited access to all my
files. And now, you seriously

26:18.000 --> 26:21.500
expect me to put
my life, my wife's life,

26:21.542 --> 26:23.834
into your hands? Into
the hands of this team

26:23.875 --> 26:27.041
when they're all safety risks?
- This team has been one step--

26:27.083 --> 26:30.875
- Neil is insubordinate, Harry
clearly can't bring him in line!

26:30.917 --> 26:34.000
And your vaudevillian
is in love with Aurora.

26:34.041 --> 26:37.959
I've seen him resist
the extremes of his own pain.

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
But when I threatened her
back at my apartment,

26:41.041 --> 26:45.041
he became compliant immediately.
That's not even <i> his <span style="bodyStyle"> failure;</i>

26:45.083 --> 26:48.041
it's yours for letting
the two work together.

26:50.250 --> 26:54.500
As far as I'm concerned,
I cannot trust the lot of you.

26:54.542 --> 26:56.959
This arrangement is off.

26:59.709 --> 27:02.041
- Franz.

27:02.083 --> 27:05.917
You know I can't
let you do that.

27:13.250 --> 27:15.834
My people are hand picked and
well trained.

27:15.875 --> 27:18.417
They've been through hell
and they're still standing.

27:18.458 --> 27:22.083
Yes, they are human,
but I consider that a plus.

27:22.125 --> 27:25.000
- I'm not willing to gamble
on what you consider a plus.

27:25.041 --> 27:28.041
- Last warning.

27:28.083 --> 27:31.125
You'd actually shoot?
- What would you do
in my position.

27:31.166 --> 27:34.125
- Colonel!
- I would shoot.
- That's my point.

27:34.166 --> 27:37.375
- But that's me.

27:37.417 --> 27:40.000
- Your call.
- Sir!

27:40.041 --> 27:42.208
Please remember
why we're here.

27:42.250 --> 27:45.083
I used to be afraid
of stepping out my front door.

27:45.125 --> 27:48.000
Then you came along out
of nowhere and you told me

27:48.041 --> 27:51.166
I could do
something that mattered.

27:51.208 --> 27:53.709
But it wasn't the colonel
who recruited me,

27:53.750 --> 27:56.000
it was the father
with one son left,

27:56.041 --> 27:58.417
the man who was afraid

27:58.458 --> 28:00.583
for the future.

28:00.625 --> 28:04.834
And I've seen you
crying on your knees,

28:04.875 --> 28:06.542
Afraid of what you'd turned
into. Because everywhere

28:06.583 --> 28:10.709
you look, you see your own boy
reaching out to you,

28:10.750 --> 28:14.041
asking why
you let go of him.

28:16.667 --> 28:20.166
- You have a son?

28:20.208 --> 28:23.041
- William.
- You're fighting for him.

28:23.083 --> 28:25.875
- I stopped fighting for
principles a long time ago.

28:25.917 --> 28:28.792
He's probably not even alive,
but even if he isn't--

28:28.834 --> 28:31.083
- He's why you're here.

28:31.125 --> 28:33.500
What happened to him?

28:33.542 --> 28:35.917
- Shot down in the Pacific.

28:39.834 --> 28:42.250
- I was right.
- About what?

28:45.458 --> 28:47.792
- You have no control
over your people.

28:54.083 --> 28:56.500
You will respect my terms.

28:58.500 --> 29:00.458
- We'll start small.

29:00.500 --> 29:03.125
We'll use
your protocol.

29:03.166 --> 29:05.667
No visits to
the home or office.

29:05.709 --> 29:09.125
- You will protect
my position. You will
not compromise me or my wife.

30:14.750 --> 30:17.959
- Put your hands behind your
head.

30:21.542 --> 30:23.917
)

30:34.625 --> 30:36.625
AAH!

31:00.041 --> 31:03.125
- Oh no, you don't!

31:06.208 --> 31:09.083
Let's get him out
back to the jeep.

31:23.041 --> 31:27.333
- Just up ahead.

31:27.375 --> 31:28.417
- We'll ditch the car

31:28.458 --> 31:30.417
in the woods and
do a reckie on foot.

31:30.458 --> 31:32.375
- Did he say how big
the holding station was?

31:32.417 --> 31:34.750
- Oh shit.

31:34.792 --> 31:37.000
- Do a U-turn.
- That'll

31:37.041 --> 31:39.542
hardly look suspicious.
- What, so we're gonna
run right into them?

31:39.583 --> 31:42.875
- We're French civilians
with nothing to hide.

31:42.917 --> 31:45.709
- Stop!

31:50.875 --> 31:54.333
- There's just three of them.
- Could be 20 more in there.

31:54.375 --> 31:56.625
- Don't move. Hands in the air.

31:56.667 --> 32:00.166
Get out of the car.
- Is something wrong?

32:00.208 --> 32:02.458
- Get out of the car!

32:06.125 --> 32:08.041
- Did we do something wrong?
- There.

32:08.083 --> 32:11.792
Go there! Come on!

32:14.875 --> 32:17.000
Turn around.

32:17.041 --> 32:19.083
Turn. Turn!

32:19.125 --> 32:21.375
On the ground!

32:21.417 --> 32:24.250
- On the ground!

32:38.959 --> 32:41.625
Would it have been so hard to
check the fuel before we left?

32:41.667 --> 32:44.875
Go get the hose!

32:44.917 --> 32:47.625
They expect us in Caillefaux
in 40 minutes. I'm not going

32:47.667 --> 32:52.166
to take the blame
for this! We need your gas.

32:58.083 --> 33:01.417
- Good call coming
on the road trip.

33:04.834 --> 33:08.834
- I've seen her,
I've seen Sabine.

33:08.875 --> 33:11.000
- Is she alright?
- I'm not sure.

33:11.041 --> 33:14.625
She is at the Hotel Renier. She
was escorted by an SS Officer

33:14.667 --> 33:17.208
and his security entourage.
- What was the man's rank?

33:17.250 --> 33:20.000
- It was two diamonds
and three leaves.

33:20.041 --> 33:22.709
- Obergruppenfuhrer.

33:22.750 --> 33:25.333
- I should have known.
- Known what?

33:25.375 --> 33:28.041
- Obergruppenfuhrer
Ulrich Schmidt

33:28.083 --> 33:31.875
- Ulrich Waldemar Schmidt.
Late wife, Elsa Elisabeth. PhD

33:31.917 --> 33:35.500
in Mathematics. Currently
Minister of Natural Resources.

33:35.542 --> 33:37.792
He's one of Himmler's
inner circle.

33:37.834 --> 33:39.250
- He's her father.

33:44.125 --> 33:45.709
- Yes.

33:45.750 --> 33:48.166
That's fine.

33:48.208 --> 33:51.125
Thank you.

34:09.375 --> 34:12.041
Are you hungry?

34:12.083 --> 34:14.166
I ordered <i> petits fours.</i>
- Thank you.

34:14.208 --> 34:16.166
- These are my favourites too!

34:16.208 --> 34:18.000
- No, I mean for
coming all this way.

34:18.041 --> 34:21.542
It was selfish of me to think
you would have the time.

34:21.583 --> 34:23.917
- I wanted to.

34:23.958 --> 34:27.125
And I had to be here
for this evening.

34:30.083 --> 34:32.208
How's your room?
- Perfect.

34:32.250 --> 34:35.333
402, just down the hall.

34:37.583 --> 34:40.041
- I missed you...

34:40.083 --> 34:43.583
hearing your voice.

34:45.583 --> 34:48.125
But you sounded
so upset.

34:50.375 --> 34:53.792
You've been quiet
since the train station.

34:53.833 --> 34:57.000
What is it, Bine?

35:00.000 --> 35:02.834
What was it you couldn't
tell me on the telephone?

35:02.875 --> 35:06.834
- I don't know where to start.

35:12.375 --> 35:16.041
Ulli... He died five weeks ago.

35:31.208 --> 35:34.000
- I'm so sorry.

35:37.834 --> 35:41.375
Oh, Sabine,
I'm so sorry.

35:41.417 --> 35:44.166
- There was no one
I could talk to,

35:44.208 --> 35:46.667
no one who knew him.

35:46.709 --> 35:50.500
I've been so alone.

35:50.542 --> 35:53.917
- What about Franz?

35:53.959 --> 35:56.667
<i>- How close is Sabine</i>
<i>with her father?</i>

35:56.709 --> 35:58.667
- Very close. He's always been
protective of her. Especially

35:58.709 --> 36:00.959
since her mother died
- Close enough she'd tell him

36:01.000 --> 36:03.834
too much?

36:03.875 --> 36:06.000
- She wouldn't.

36:06.041 --> 36:08.959
- You don't seem so sure.
- Let's go to the hotel.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.125
There may be a way
to make sure she cooperates.

36:11.166 --> 36:13.500
If it's not too late.

36:13.542 --> 36:17.083
- Be careful. If she's said
anything, they'll be
on the lookout.

36:17.125 --> 36:20.041
- We're always careful.
- I need to get back

36:20.083 --> 36:22.166
to my office.
- You can't, not yet.

36:22.208 --> 36:25.583
- There's a telephone call
at 5 o'clock from Berlin.
It's been scheduled for 2 days.

36:25.625 --> 36:29.000
- For 2 days?
- It's just a call
of congratulations.

36:29.041 --> 36:31.792
Nevertheless.
- What's the occasion?

36:31.834 --> 36:34.458
- My promotion
to Brigadefuhrer.

36:34.500 --> 36:38.000
For my contribution
to our success at Dieppe.

36:40.542 --> 36:44.458
- From the man himself?

36:44.500 --> 36:46.792
I see.

36:46.834 --> 36:49.208
Well, the thing is,
if Sabine talked,

36:49.250 --> 36:51.667
it doesn't matter if you're
back for that call or not.

36:51.709 --> 36:54.291
Trust my team.

36:54.333 --> 36:56.709
They will figure out
where we stand.

36:56.750 --> 37:00.125
We'll get you back
in time if it's safe.

37:00.166 --> 37:02.417
Now,

37:02.458 --> 37:04.542
I know that I said
we'd start out small,

37:04.583 --> 37:08.208
but that was before...
I knew about your promotion.

37:08.250 --> 37:11.208
And your father-in-law.

37:11.250 --> 37:15.000
What do you say we...
don't start out small?

37:17.000 --> 37:18.542
- What do you mean?

37:18.583 --> 37:21.625
- What if there's a way
to win this war a little faster.

37:21.667 --> 37:26.000
Off the battlefield.
Lives... saved on both sides.

37:26.041 --> 37:28.750
You think
the Nazis can't lose,

37:28.792 --> 37:30.792
let's talk about what's
keeping their war going.

37:32.375 --> 37:34.917
Let's talk about oil.

37:41.709 --> 37:45.041
- How're you doing,
Fritz? Good?

37:45.083 --> 37:48.208
Yeah?

37:48.250 --> 37:50.417
Look at you.
I can't wait to see

37:50.458 --> 37:53.208
the look on my girlfriend's face
when I tell her I got to kick

37:53.250 --> 37:56.542
actual Fascist ass today.

37:56.583 --> 38:00.083
Sorry. I was kidding.

38:00.125 --> 38:03.417
But I... do
get to watch, right?

38:03.458 --> 38:06.458
Interrogation training?
- Go.

38:06.500 --> 38:08.542
Both of you!
I'll make sure

38:08.583 --> 38:10.625
you get credit
for the extracurricular.

38:10.667 --> 38:14.125
-: Alright. Let me
know if you need anything.

38:14.166 --> 38:16.166
Anything at all.

38:21.333 --> 38:23.417
- So?

38:23.458 --> 38:25.959
What happened?

38:26.000 --> 38:28.917
Did the Frommer boy chicken out?

38:28.959 --> 38:30.959
- No.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.166
Klaus Frommer,
who was a brave,

38:33.208 --> 38:35.417
gentle, patriotic
young man,

38:35.458 --> 38:38.083
actually managed to smuggle the
bomb you gave him into the Camp,

38:38.125 --> 38:41.542
and came this close to blowing
up our Communications Centre

38:41.583 --> 38:43.542
and taking our Colonel
down with him.

38:43.583 --> 38:45.208
- I'm sorry...

38:45.250 --> 38:48.041
you said he "was"?

38:48.083 --> 38:51.041
- I shot him.

38:51.083 --> 38:53.041
- Huh...

38:53.083 --> 38:55.125
How did that go?

38:55.166 --> 38:58.458
- I have a duty
to the uniform I wear

38:58.500 --> 39:01.709
to treat prisoners
with respect and civility.

39:01.750 --> 39:03.917
But right now,

39:03.959 --> 39:06.000
my boss is out of town.

39:07.959 --> 39:10.542
And there's no one
here but me...

39:10.583 --> 39:12.500
and you.

39:14.417 --> 39:16.959
<i>- Ja!</i>

39:18.417 --> 39:22.125
- Could be worse. At least,
we're almost there.

39:22.166 --> 39:25.000
- You, sit down.
I said, "Sit down!"

39:25.041 --> 39:27.250
- Did you hear that?

39:27.291 --> 39:31.000
There's no soldiers
in there, they're prisoners.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.750
- Where did they say
they were going?

39:56.792 --> 39:58.750
- Uh, it sounded
like Caillefaux.

39:58.792 --> 40:02.166
I think it was Caillefaux.

40:11.000 --> 40:15.041
- I'll get it ready.
- Meet you back here.

40:27.125 --> 40:29.083
<i>- I know it's hard,</i>

40:29.125 --> 40:31.417
but maybe we should
look for a silver lining.

40:31.458 --> 40:34.208
- What do you mean?
- Well, it sounds wrong

40:34.250 --> 40:36.041
to say this but, uh...

40:36.083 --> 40:38.291
maybe it's for the best.

40:38.333 --> 40:41.959
Poor Ulli,
he wasn't well.

40:42.000 --> 40:45.834
- He wasn't sick.
- No, no, of course, uh...

40:45.875 --> 40:49.000
what I mean is...

40:49.041 --> 40:51.792
despite all the love...

40:51.834 --> 40:53.959
all the love in the world
you had for him,

40:54.000 --> 40:56.583
Mongoloids never
develop normally.

40:56.625 --> 40:59.125
And when you think
about the future,

40:59.166 --> 41:01.375
what would it
have been?

41:01.417 --> 41:04.166
For him?

41:04.208 --> 41:06.667
For you?

41:12.250 --> 41:14.875
You are still so young...

41:14.917 --> 41:17.208
you have so much to hope for.

41:19.208 --> 41:22.125
The most important thing is

41:22.166 --> 41:26.000
what happened is not your fault.

41:26.041 --> 41:28.208
-: Oh, Papa.

41:28.250 --> 41:31.208
- It's not <i> your <span style="bodyStyle"> fault.</i>

41:31.250 --> 41:34.458
I blame myself.
Maybe I should've had

41:34.500 --> 41:36.709
Franz's background
checked more thoroughly.

41:36.750 --> 41:41.166
I always knew
you deserved better.

41:41.208 --> 41:43.125
But I saw how you loved him.

41:44.500 --> 41:47.834
He made you laugh...

41:47.875 --> 41:50.959
for the first time
since we lost Mama.

42:05.834 --> 42:08.166
I only wanted
to make you happy again,

42:08.208 --> 42:11.000
which you will be...

42:11.041 --> 42:14.166
I promise.

42:14.208 --> 42:16.166
Now,

42:16.208 --> 42:19.125
I wish
the timing was better.

42:19.166 --> 42:22.542
But I'm expecting
someone for a meeting.

42:28.709 --> 42:31.250
Sweetheart...

42:31.291 --> 42:33.709
was there something else
you wanted to tell me?

42:33.750 --> 42:36.959
- No. I'll go to my room,
maybe lie down.

42:42.083 --> 42:45.333
- 'Bine, what is it?

42:45.375 --> 42:48.083
Please.

42:48.125 --> 42:50.125
You can tell
your father.

42:50.166 --> 42:52.041
- Papa...

42:52.083 --> 42:55.000
it's serious.

42:55.041 --> 42:57.041
It's about Franz.
