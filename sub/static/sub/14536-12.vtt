WEBVTT

00:02.770 --> 00:04.970
All right, so what
do you got, Dad

00:05.006 --> 00:07.047
There have been a lot
of computer breaches lately.

00:07.082 --> 00:09.399
- ( Coughing )
- Dad, you good?

00:09.434 --> 00:13.019
Yeah, I'm fine. Anyway...

00:13.055 --> 00:14.935
Noah Stone, one of
the most brilliant hackers...

00:14.965 --> 00:17.073
( coughing )

00:17.109 --> 00:18.550
( spits )

00:19.953 --> 00:23.121
Oh, my.

00:23.157 --> 00:25.974
Yeah, you're fine.

00:26.009 --> 00:27.779
Would you like me to get you
some toast for that lung butter?

00:27.803 --> 00:30.604
I said I'm fine, okay?

00:30.639 --> 00:33.573
Anyway, the Organization
has traced Noah

00:33.608 --> 00:35.975
to just outside Fargo.

00:36.011 --> 00:39.913
You and I are going there
to bring that hacker in...

00:39.990 --> 00:42.799
Yeah, why go get him
when we got a hacker right here?

00:42.835 --> 00:45.051
Dad, obviously you're sick.

00:45.087 --> 00:47.371
No, I'm not. I'm perfectly...

00:47.406 --> 00:49.214
achy and tired.

00:49.249 --> 00:51.617
My throat is scratchy.

00:51.652 --> 00:53.135
I think I'm getting sick.

00:53.170 --> 00:54.928
Really? What was
your first clue?

00:54.963 --> 00:57.397
Was it the chills, the fever,

00:57.433 --> 01:00.092
me telling you over
and over that you're sick?

01:01.903 --> 01:04.153
I can handle
the mission on my own.

01:04.189 --> 01:05.972
No, that's not a good idea, KC.

01:06.007 --> 01:06.849
Will you stop
treating me like a child?

01:06.884 --> 01:08.325
I can handle it.

01:08.360 --> 01:10.497
Besides, how hard can it be
to take down some computer geek?

01:10.521 --> 01:13.012
Excuse me?!

01:13.048 --> 01:16.533
Computer geeks can be
extremely dangerous.

01:16.569 --> 01:19.578
Look at me.

01:19.655 --> 01:21.705
Yeah, you're right.
You can handle this on your own.

01:21.740 --> 01:23.832
I trust you completely.

01:23.867 --> 01:26.168
I'm gonna hold off on that hug.

01:26.170 --> 01:30.230
I wanna catch a bad guy,
not a bad cold. All right.

01:30.265 --> 01:33.859
¶ Oh, when danger
comes for you ¶

01:33.894 --> 01:37.054
¶ You know
I'll stand beside you ¶

01:37.131 --> 01:41.007
¶ 'Cause ain't nobody
keep things hustle cool ¶

01:41.042 --> 01:45.069
¶ I'll always find a way,
a way out of the fire ¶

01:45.105 --> 01:48.815
¶ Don't tell nobody,
tell nobody ¶

01:48.850 --> 01:50.909
¶ I'm not perfect ¶

01:50.945 --> 01:54.980
¶ So many things
I wanna tell you ¶

01:55.015 --> 01:58.917
¶ But I, I, I,
I keep it undercover ¶

01:58.953 --> 02:00.944
¶ Livin' my life,
no way to learn ¶

02:00.979 --> 02:03.305
¶ Doin' my thing,
gonna make it work ¶

02:03.340 --> 02:05.448
¶ Know I'm the realest,
baby, I'm fearless ¶

02:05.484 --> 02:07.559
¶ But I always got your back ¶

02:07.594 --> 02:09.444
¶ Nobody can do it like I can ¶

02:09.479 --> 02:11.688
¶ I gotta find out who I am ¶

02:11.723 --> 02:14.324
¶ Ain't got to worry about me ¶

02:14.359 --> 02:15.675
¶ It's all part of the plan ¶

02:15.710 --> 02:17.786
I keep it undercover.

02:17.821 --> 02:19.296
I keep it undercover.

02:27.556 --> 02:28.864
Noah Stone?

02:28.899 --> 02:31.007
Maybe. Who are you?

02:31.042 --> 02:33.043
I am your worst nightmare.

02:33.078 --> 02:34.188
You're a high school
Spanish class

02:34.212 --> 02:35.596
I forgot to go to all semester,

02:35.631 --> 02:38.631
and suddenly there's a big test,

02:38.667 --> 02:39.735
and I'm not wearing any pants but I
am wearing my grandmother's girdle?

02:39.759 --> 02:42.844
Hey, computer hacker, you don't really
talk to a lot of real people, do you?

02:42.880 --> 02:45.105
No. No, I do not.

02:45.140 --> 02:47.132
Well, I'm taking you
into custody.

02:47.167 --> 02:50.085
- Oh...
- Gotcha!

02:50.120 --> 02:52.020
I'm taking you into custody.

02:52.055 --> 02:54.280
Uh, excuse me. Who are you?

02:54.316 --> 02:56.475
Pinky Carter,
professional bounty hunter.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.026
( Scoffs )

02:58.061 --> 02:59.719
Okay, you're a bounty hunter?

02:59.754 --> 03:02.672
Yes, a bounty hunter.

03:02.707 --> 03:06.351
A bounty hunter is someone who
goes after bad guys for money.

03:06.386 --> 03:09.095
Do you want me to explain
what money is?

03:09.131 --> 03:11.740
Okay, you keep up that attitude,

03:11.775 --> 03:13.853
I'll explain what a sock full of
quarters is like to your kneecaps.

03:13.877 --> 03:16.937
I don't know how
you reckon things down yonder,

03:16.972 --> 03:20.190
but he's mine, okay? I got him
first, so take a walk, sister.

03:20.225 --> 03:22.333
If I'm takin' a walk,
guess I'm walkin' with you.

03:22.369 --> 03:24.519
- He's mine.
- No, he's mine.

03:24.555 --> 03:27.263
I never thought two women
would be fighting over me.

03:27.298 --> 03:29.474
I'm sure no one did.
Now let's go.

03:29.509 --> 03:31.676
Ooh. Sounds like
she means business.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.812
I guess you have
no choice. Uncuff me.

03:33.847 --> 03:37.065
Look, there's a reward
on his head,

03:37.100 --> 03:39.200
and if I don't bring him
in, I ain't gettin' paid.

03:39.236 --> 03:41.803
( laughs ) If you let me
out of these cuffs,

03:41.839 --> 03:42.620
I can hack into a bank and wire
you all the money you want.

03:42.655 --> 03:44.539
Win-win!

03:44.574 --> 03:46.341
Look, you're not
getting it, okay?

03:46.377 --> 03:48.368
I am from a government agency,

03:48.403 --> 03:49.798
which means I outrank you.
Do you understand?

03:49.822 --> 03:53.356
I don't understand.

03:53.391 --> 03:56.843
I'm just a dumb hayseed
from the sticks.

03:56.879 --> 03:59.988
Maybe you should remove
your handcuffs from my prisoner,

04:00.023 --> 04:02.106
and draw me a picture.

04:02.142 --> 04:05.010
You know, I am a great artist.

04:05.045 --> 04:06.344
If you let me
out of these cuffs,

04:06.379 --> 04:08.254
I can show you.
You like caricatures?

04:08.290 --> 04:11.065
I can draw you
in a teeny, tiny car.

04:11.101 --> 04:13.618
Last chance, okay?
Back off, Backwoods Barbie.

04:13.653 --> 04:17.380
Wow, you're like the pimple I
had on my forehead last week.

04:17.415 --> 04:19.866
You just won't go away.

04:19.902 --> 04:22.903
Really? Was it that one
or was it that one?

04:22.938 --> 04:24.399
- Oh, you just get outta here.
- You get outta here.

04:24.423 --> 04:26.765
( Arguing )

04:26.800 --> 04:28.320
( falsetto voice )
I say we let him go.

04:32.180 --> 04:34.714
Okay, for your next assignment,

04:34.750 --> 04:36.574
you'll be pairing off
as married couples.

04:36.610 --> 04:39.269
You'll be learning
to balance a budget,

04:39.304 --> 04:41.290
raise a family, and get
through important life events.

04:41.314 --> 04:42.367
So everybody pick a partner.

04:42.391 --> 04:44.040
Hey, do you...

04:44.075 --> 04:45.400
Hey, do...

04:53.551 --> 04:57.511
I always knew
we'd end up together.

04:57.547 --> 05:00.006
Um, excuse me, Mrs. Greenfield.

05:00.041 --> 05:02.642
Is one of life's
important events

05:02.678 --> 05:04.952
learning to love again
after your fianc

05:04.988 --> 05:08.098
tragically dies before
this assignment begins?

05:08.133 --> 05:10.467
Not if you wanna
pass this class.

05:13.372 --> 05:16.431
I was thinking somewhere
romantic for the honeymoon,

05:16.466 --> 05:18.026
like the Lord of the Rings
Hobbit Hotel.

05:26.385 --> 05:28.526
Well, you know you're in
a real fleabag motel

05:28.561 --> 05:31.154
if the hotel desk clerk
doesn't bat an eye

05:31.189 --> 05:32.997
when three handcuffed
people check in to

05:33.032 --> 05:35.825
a double occupancy room.

05:35.860 --> 05:38.219
Yeah, I just saw a rat
crawl under the bed,

05:38.255 --> 05:39.815
so technically,
there's four of us here.

05:41.391 --> 05:43.667
I don't know
what we're doin' here.

05:43.702 --> 05:45.546
No matter who gets the credit,
we gotta get this guy to D.C.

05:45.570 --> 05:46.978
Nighttime's
the best time to move.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.389
We can't move if
we can't move our feet.

05:49.466 --> 05:50.551
We're exhausted, so we're
spending the night here.

05:50.575 --> 05:52.308
Or... you guys
can get some rest,

05:52.343 --> 05:55.228
I'll get a head start,

05:55.264 --> 05:56.900
we can all meet up in an outlet
mall in Secaucus, New Jersey,

05:56.924 --> 05:58.982
where you can get a great deal

05:58.984 --> 06:00.904
on hardly irregular items,
and I'll stop talking.

06:02.462 --> 06:04.112
All right, guys,
first things first.

06:04.147 --> 06:05.530
We need to get something to eat.

06:05.565 --> 06:08.992
There's a convenience
store 20 miles away.

06:09.027 --> 06:10.318
That's not convenient at all!

06:14.257 --> 06:14.897
What are we gonna do?
I'm starving.

06:14.932 --> 06:16.533
Me, too.

06:19.762 --> 06:21.053
You brought your own food?

06:21.089 --> 06:23.381
I know I'm not very bright,

06:23.416 --> 06:26.033
on account of you
explaining that to me,

06:26.069 --> 06:27.749
but I'm smart enough
to know I like to eat.

06:31.708 --> 06:33.008
Ooh, still hot.

06:33.043 --> 06:35.793
Is that tomato?

06:35.828 --> 06:38.471
Yeah, made from freshly picked
tomatoes right from my own garden.

06:40.225 --> 06:42.683
Do I detect a hint of basil?

06:42.719 --> 06:44.436
Also from my own garden.

06:47.933 --> 06:51.309
Um, can I, uh,

06:51.344 --> 06:53.003
please have some of that?

06:53.038 --> 06:54.804
Sorry, city slicker.

06:54.839 --> 06:56.239
Only enough for
me and the prisoner.

07:04.657 --> 07:08.135
- I feel bad eatin' in front of you.
- Thank you.

07:08.211 --> 07:09.605
So you unlock yourself
and go get you something.

07:09.629 --> 07:11.112
We'll wait right here.

07:11.147 --> 07:12.955
You know what? I'm fine.

07:12.991 --> 07:14.791
I have been trained
to go days without eating.

07:18.121 --> 07:21.773
( Stomach growling loudly )

07:21.850 --> 07:23.770
Okay, I have been trained,
but my stomach hasn't.

07:25.345 --> 07:26.905
Please just give me
a little bite, guys.

07:31.117 --> 07:34.477
Here you go, honey.

07:34.513 --> 07:37.305
I need my other blanket.
This one's scratchy.

07:37.340 --> 07:39.682
At least you get a blanket.

07:39.718 --> 07:41.534
I sleep in a box.

07:43.830 --> 07:46.314
- Here you go, sweetheart.
- Thank you.

07:46.349 --> 07:48.023
Why can't he do
anything for himself?

07:48.059 --> 07:50.168
He's sick.

07:50.203 --> 07:51.723
What kind of sickness
turns a grown man

07:51.754 --> 07:53.671
- into a baby?
- Every kind.

07:56.059 --> 07:59.936
But he is my husband
in sickness and in health.

07:59.971 --> 08:02.680
And he'd do it for me,
so it's all good.

08:02.715 --> 08:04.941
Sweetheart, would you
get me some soup?

08:04.976 --> 08:05.767
Sure, baby.
I'll go heat some up for you.

08:05.802 --> 08:08.094
Oh, canned soup?

08:08.130 --> 08:10.504
I was hoping for my mama's
make-you-feel-better soup.

08:10.540 --> 08:13.908
Are you suggesting

08:13.943 --> 08:15.944
that I call your mother,

08:15.979 --> 08:18.087
get the recipe,

08:18.123 --> 08:20.198
go to the store,
buy all the ingredients,

08:20.234 --> 08:22.534
and spend the next three hours

08:22.569 --> 08:24.377
making you soup?

08:24.412 --> 08:26.546
I would do it myself,
but I'm just...

08:26.581 --> 08:29.448
( coughing ) so sick.

08:29.484 --> 08:32.218
All right, fine.
I'll make your mama's soup.

08:32.253 --> 08:34.412
Thank you. And sweetheart,
before you go.

08:34.447 --> 08:36.731
- Uh-huh?
- Am I hot?

08:36.767 --> 08:38.675
No, honey, you definitely
ain't hot.

08:48.711 --> 08:51.671
Ooh, I am tired.

08:51.706 --> 08:54.032
If I don't get
my eight hours, I am no good.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.992
You're wanted in all 50 states.

08:56.027 --> 08:57.027
We know you're no good.

08:59.923 --> 09:02.293
Besides, the second we fall asleep,
you're gonna try to escape.

09:02.317 --> 09:04.642
That's not true.

09:04.677 --> 09:06.986
I'd wait ten minutes at least,
just to be sure.

09:07.022 --> 09:09.672
Wait. You insist that we
check into a motel

09:09.707 --> 09:12.709
so we don't get
a good night's sleep?

09:12.744 --> 09:15.962
I'm just learning so much
from you, professional.

09:15.997 --> 09:17.939
Calling me professional
is not an insult.

09:17.974 --> 09:18.974
It's just accurate.

09:21.035 --> 09:23.061
Now we are not gonna sleep.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.812
We're just gonna
get some rest, all right?

09:24.847 --> 09:26.264
- Ow!
- Oh, sorry.

09:26.299 --> 09:29.033
Other way. Ow!

09:29.069 --> 09:30.869
Okay, this is nuts.
We gotta do this together.

09:30.904 --> 09:33.971
On three. One, two, three.

09:34.006 --> 09:35.506
Scooch.

09:35.542 --> 09:37.567
Scooch.

09:41.707 --> 09:44.540
- I need to be on the right or...
- For reals?

09:44.575 --> 09:46.325
I'll never get to sleep.

09:46.361 --> 09:48.753
How are we gonna do that?

09:48.788 --> 09:50.855
Lift your leg, I'll go under.

09:50.891 --> 09:52.974
KC: Watch the arm.

09:53.009 --> 09:55.026
Like that.

09:55.062 --> 09:56.210
Okay, that's good.

09:59.374 --> 10:01.254
- I need to be on my stomach.
- Are you serious?

10:04.187 --> 10:06.729
This is ridiculous.

10:06.764 --> 10:09.223
That's my arm, that's my arm.

10:14.573 --> 10:16.106
- Yeah, I meant the left.
- KC: Hey!

10:16.141 --> 10:18.149
No more moving.

10:21.863 --> 10:24.364
( Gunfire )

10:24.399 --> 10:26.324
( shrieking )

10:28.786 --> 10:31.521
- What was that?
- Laser fire.

10:31.556 --> 10:33.615
Let me put that in a way
you might understand.

10:33.650 --> 10:35.675
Pew, pew. Pew, pew,
pew, pew, pew.

10:35.710 --> 10:37.685
I know what a laser is.

10:37.721 --> 10:39.270
I meant who's shootin'
at us and why?

10:39.305 --> 10:42.573
Probably the guy who hired me
to hack the security system

10:42.608 --> 10:44.884
I didn't hack because
you caught me.

10:44.919 --> 10:46.778
You know what?
We need to go to the bathroom.

10:46.813 --> 10:49.789
Oh, really? Is now the best
time to try to figure that out?

10:49.824 --> 10:51.490
MAN: We know
you're in there, Noah.

10:51.526 --> 10:53.326
Come out or we're coming in.

10:53.362 --> 10:55.162
So much for the do not disturb sign.
Let's go.

10:57.357 --> 11:00.808
Is now a bad time to mention
I'm afraid of heights?

11:00.844 --> 11:03.787
I'm just kidding.
I know it's a bad time.

11:03.789 --> 11:06.497
Don't worry. We're not gonna
be up here very long.

11:06.533 --> 11:08.616
We're jumping.

11:08.651 --> 11:10.943
Jumpin'? And you think
I'm the dumb one?

11:10.979 --> 11:12.737
It's our only chance, okay?
We go on three.

11:12.772 --> 11:15.381
Thousand. We go on 3,000.

11:15.416 --> 11:17.717
- One...
- Let's talk about this.

11:17.752 --> 11:19.552
- Two.
- Please stop counting.

11:19.587 --> 11:21.629
- BOTH: Three.
- ( screaming )

11:27.612 --> 11:28.828
( scream echoing )

11:28.864 --> 11:29.864
Okay, on our butts.

11:33.793 --> 11:35.435
- Now what?
- We run.

11:35.470 --> 11:37.320
( Screaming )

11:37.355 --> 11:38.271
BOTH: We'll go your way.

11:38.306 --> 11:40.657
( Screaming )

11:40.692 --> 11:42.245
It's all right.
I'm just a computer guy.

11:42.269 --> 11:43.934
It's not like I need my hands.

11:43.970 --> 11:46.604
Do you get paid extra for
bringing him in in one piece?

11:46.639 --> 11:47.797
- No.
- Good to know.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.198
Let's go.

11:52.820 --> 11:55.913
Let's take a look at
our marital profile.

11:55.948 --> 11:58.666
Okay, it says here
I'm a court stenographer

11:58.702 --> 12:01.845
making $53,000 a year.

12:01.847 --> 12:04.930
You're a dental hygienist
making $42,000 a year.

12:04.966 --> 12:06.132
Uh, yeah, no.

12:08.645 --> 12:10.561
No, see, that can't be right,

12:10.597 --> 12:13.590
because I would never have a job
making less money than you,

12:13.625 --> 12:15.808
or touching people's
filthy mouths.

12:17.870 --> 12:20.162
In fact, I don't want a job.

12:20.198 --> 12:23.499
I see myself
as a wealthy philanthropist

12:23.535 --> 12:26.293
who entertains
dignitaries on her yacht.

12:26.329 --> 12:29.180
And I see myself
passing this class.

12:29.215 --> 12:30.793
One of our dreams
could actually come true.

12:30.817 --> 12:33.108
So pick a place to live.

12:33.144 --> 12:34.963
I suggest we get
a starter home in the suburbs.

12:34.987 --> 12:38.831
Or we'd save lots of money
by living with my parents,

12:38.866 --> 12:41.859
- and buying an even nicer house.
- Ew! No way!

12:41.894 --> 12:43.438
Why not? You practically
live here already.

12:43.462 --> 12:45.096
You are so controlling.

12:45.131 --> 12:46.589
I never should have married you.

12:48.952 --> 12:50.893
You think you're a bed of roses?

12:50.928 --> 12:52.386
I don't even know you anymore.

12:54.265 --> 12:56.949
Will you two stop it?

12:56.985 --> 12:58.629
You wanna know how to make
a relationship work?

12:58.653 --> 13:00.369
Just look at Craig and Kira.

13:00.405 --> 13:03.957
I spent five hours
making his mama's dang soup.

13:03.992 --> 13:05.816
He doesn't like it.

13:05.852 --> 13:07.860
Now he wants me to heat up a can

13:07.895 --> 13:09.586
like I wanted to do
in the first place.

13:09.622 --> 13:10.782
That man is driving me crazy!

13:12.784 --> 13:15.543
CRAIG: Hurry, Kira.
I think I'm dying.

13:15.578 --> 13:17.328
I should be so lucky.

13:23.236 --> 13:26.295
Okay, this is the saddest
marionette show I've ever seen.

13:28.558 --> 13:30.816
Look, Annie Oakley,

13:30.852 --> 13:32.994
I hate to interrupt
your whittlin',

13:33.029 --> 13:33.569
but those guys are long gone,
so we should keep going.

13:33.604 --> 13:35.088
Oh, really?

13:35.123 --> 13:37.664
Because I grew up huntin',

13:37.700 --> 13:39.895
and I think they're just waitin'
for us to come out in the open

13:39.919 --> 13:41.944
so they can pick us off
like a six-point buck.

13:41.979 --> 13:44.113
Here's another point.
That's disgusting.

13:44.149 --> 13:46.707
You shouldn't be bragging about
hunting defenseless animals.

13:46.743 --> 13:48.434
Yeah, she's right.
Hunting is gross.

13:48.469 --> 13:50.328
Would you prefer us
gettin' caught

13:50.363 --> 13:53.823
and taken out by your boss?

13:53.858 --> 13:56.578
I don't know about you, but I'd
rather be the hunter than the hunted.

13:57.136 --> 13:59.462
On the other hand,
hunting can be kinda cool.

13:59.497 --> 14:02.456
Look, we need to move.

14:02.491 --> 14:03.953
We gotta find somewhere
to sleep tonight.

14:03.977 --> 14:05.584
I already got one.

14:05.620 --> 14:07.003
I'm buildin' a lean-to.

14:10.642 --> 14:13.009
I guess a lean-to will work.

14:15.547 --> 14:19.081
Oh, sorry, Miss High and Mighty.

14:19.116 --> 14:21.183
It's a lean two,
not a lean three.

14:26.482 --> 14:28.122
Whatever happened to
southern hospitality?

14:30.019 --> 14:31.686
Just gonna leave me
out here high and dry.

14:31.721 --> 14:33.029
( Thunder rumbles,
rain falling )

14:35.150 --> 14:36.983
I said high and dry! Get over!

14:37.018 --> 14:40.169
Sorry. No room
at the inn. Get out!

14:40.205 --> 14:42.445
There would be plenty of room
if you shut your big mouth!

14:45.043 --> 14:46.512
Would you both shush?
I think I heard something.

14:46.536 --> 14:49.695
Probably just a critter.

14:49.731 --> 14:51.842
MAN: I see footprints. I think
they're over there in that lean-to.

14:51.866 --> 14:54.099
I'm outta here.
I'd invite you two to join me,

14:54.135 --> 14:56.416
but you know what, you don't
really have a choice, do you?

15:00.809 --> 15:02.058
( Coughing )

15:05.095 --> 15:06.365
Guess all I needed
was a good night's rest.

15:06.389 --> 15:09.699
I feel great.

15:09.734 --> 15:10.895
What you doing,
napping in the morning?

15:10.919 --> 15:13.285
I don't feel good.

15:13.320 --> 15:15.371
Buck up, you're fine.

15:15.407 --> 15:17.832
But I'm not.

15:17.867 --> 15:20.668
My throat's all scratchy,
I feel achy.

15:20.703 --> 15:22.937
I think I need some tea.

15:22.972 --> 15:24.705
That's a good idea.
I'm going out for a run.

15:29.320 --> 15:32.246
I'm sure he's just running out
to get you some tissues.

15:32.281 --> 15:34.340
And by the way,
I hate to pile on

15:34.375 --> 15:36.442
but it's "well."

15:36.477 --> 15:38.010
You don't feel well.

15:46.503 --> 15:48.866
- NOAH: Oh, wait, that's my boss' car.
- KC: That hunk of junk?

15:48.890 --> 15:51.440
I guess they're right when they
say crime really doesn't pay.

15:51.475 --> 15:54.476
Hopefully, he doesn't
mind if we borrow it,

15:54.511 --> 15:56.115
'cause fortunately, my bracelet
has lock-picking capabilities.

15:56.139 --> 15:57.697
- Stand back.
- You stand back.

16:03.421 --> 16:07.356
Fortunately, my brain has "opening
an unlocked door" capability.

16:07.392 --> 16:08.682
Who's gonna drive?

16:08.718 --> 16:11.060
- BOTH: I will.
- ( gunfire )

16:11.096 --> 16:12.631
On second thought, you drive.
Let's go. Move it.

16:12.655 --> 16:13.695
Move it, move it, move it!

16:20.430 --> 16:22.513
( Sneezes )

16:24.500 --> 16:25.766
Sorry.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.025
Okay, look, this has all been
really fun and everything,

16:31.049 --> 16:33.015
but you should know
that when we get to D.C.,

16:33.050 --> 16:34.436
I need to be
the one to take him in.

16:34.460 --> 16:36.435
Sorry. I can't let you
do that, KC.

16:36.470 --> 16:38.012
My dad is countin' on me.

16:38.047 --> 16:39.847
What are you talking about?

16:39.882 --> 16:42.349
The thing is,
my daddy and my mama

16:42.384 --> 16:43.985
and my little brother
and sister,

16:44.020 --> 16:46.470
we're all bounty hunters.

16:46.505 --> 16:50.558
Takin' down bad guys is sorta
like our family business.

16:50.593 --> 16:52.934
Wait. So you work with your
family to take down bad guys?

16:52.970 --> 16:56.939
- Mm-hmm.
- That's weird.

16:56.975 --> 16:58.791
You know, I think
it's really sweet

16:58.826 --> 17:00.334
that you two are bonding,

17:00.369 --> 17:03.112
but I haven't slept
in three days,

17:03.148 --> 17:05.614
Can we pull over so I can
take a nap, please?

17:05.650 --> 17:08.617
( Yawning ) Okay. Okay, fine.

17:08.652 --> 17:11.596
But we have to all promise that
none of us are gonna try to escape.

17:11.631 --> 17:13.531
Okay? So pinky swear, Pinky?

17:13.566 --> 17:15.967
Or Pinky, do you swear?

17:16.002 --> 17:19.312
I know I was swearin' a lot
when you first showed up.

17:19.347 --> 17:20.707
Oh, just give me
your pinky, Pinky.

17:24.852 --> 17:28.178
I'm sick of arguing
with you over everything.

17:28.214 --> 17:29.700
Can we just decide how many
kids we're having?

17:29.724 --> 17:31.765
I'm thinking four.

17:31.801 --> 17:33.167
That seems like a nightmare.

17:33.202 --> 17:35.252
For the kids.

17:35.288 --> 17:38.389
Seriously? Four kids?

17:38.424 --> 17:41.242
There is no way I am
having four kids.

17:41.277 --> 17:42.988
When would I find the time
to hire and manage

17:43.012 --> 17:45.020
all of those nannies?

17:45.056 --> 17:47.347
No nannies.

17:47.383 --> 17:49.041
I wanna be a stay-at-home dad.

17:49.076 --> 17:50.851
You expect me to support
this family

17:50.887 --> 17:52.495
on a dental hygienist's salary?!

17:52.530 --> 17:54.421
Forget it.

17:54.456 --> 17:56.549
Come on. I really wanna hear

17:56.584 --> 17:57.917
the pitter-patter
of little feet.

17:57.952 --> 17:59.401
Get a dog.

18:01.764 --> 18:04.047
Fine. But if we don't have kids,

18:04.083 --> 18:06.525
then what do we do
with the $200,000

18:06.560 --> 18:08.185
saved in the college fund?

18:08.221 --> 18:12.731
We saved $200,000?

18:12.767 --> 18:16.268
We're millionaires!

18:16.304 --> 18:18.287
Yeah, I don't think
you're gonna have to worry

18:18.322 --> 18:19.630
about your kids
going to college.

18:27.231 --> 18:28.631
Oh, sorry.
For a second, I forgot...

18:30.284 --> 18:31.684
That I wasn't
handcuffed to anybody!

18:34.005 --> 18:35.796
Dang it!
Cannot believe I got duped

18:35.831 --> 18:37.314
by that bumpkin spice latte.

18:41.546 --> 18:43.428
So as you can see,

18:43.464 --> 18:45.781
my husband Ernest,

18:45.816 --> 18:49.801
a very well-respected court
stenographer, and I,

18:49.837 --> 18:53.155
have decided not to have
any children.

18:53.191 --> 18:56.734
And that dramatically
increased our disposable income.

18:56.769 --> 18:58.169
I can now afford
a fancy sports car.

19:00.464 --> 19:02.172
And we purchased a second home.

19:02.208 --> 19:04.267
A ski house in Vermont.

19:04.343 --> 19:08.137
That way, we never have to
actually see each other.

19:08.172 --> 19:10.212
Which makes me think
this marriage can last forever.

19:12.201 --> 19:14.810
But you didn't do
the assignment.

19:14.845 --> 19:16.348
You were supposed to balance
a budget for a family.

19:16.372 --> 19:18.939
( Both laughing )

19:18.974 --> 19:21.909
This isn't the oldie days,
Mrs. Greenfield.

19:21.986 --> 19:25.738
Right. You can be a family
without having any kids.

19:25.773 --> 19:29.299
Welcome to 2016.

19:29.335 --> 19:32.561
I guess you guys
kinda do make a point.

19:32.596 --> 19:35.247
All right. I am giving
Marisa and Ernie an "A."

19:38.553 --> 19:40.686
You know, we make
a really good team...

19:40.721 --> 19:42.696
Mrs. Cooper.

19:42.732 --> 19:43.732
Uh, nah.

19:54.126 --> 19:57.761
See? This is why
I don't go outside.

19:57.797 --> 19:59.241
This never would've happened
inside my parents' basement.

19:59.265 --> 20:01.932
We're trapped.

20:01.968 --> 20:03.454
I don't see any way out of
this, short of a miracle.

20:03.478 --> 20:06.253
Aw, did you just
call me a miracle?

20:06.289 --> 20:08.389
I always knew deep down,
you admired me.

20:08.424 --> 20:11.141
If I didn't before, I sure do now.
Help us.

20:11.177 --> 20:13.076
Oh, I would love to,

20:13.112 --> 20:15.704
right after
I secure my prisoner.

20:18.125 --> 20:20.251
Great. We're all back together.

20:24.857 --> 20:26.757
Yeah, he's not firing back.

20:26.792 --> 20:28.432
- I think I scared him off.
- Think again.

20:41.524 --> 20:43.565
I hope you'll still give me
a good recommendation.

20:43.601 --> 20:44.841
I get all my work on referrals.

20:59.533 --> 21:01.942
Aw, come on! What did I do
to deserve this?

21:01.977 --> 21:04.060
Hacked a bunch of computers.

21:04.096 --> 21:06.313
Stole sensitive information.

21:06.349 --> 21:07.692
Sold secrets to
the highest bidder.

21:07.716 --> 21:09.356
But you know what.
Don't beat yourself up.

21:15.124 --> 21:17.800
Hey, Kira, how you doing?

21:17.835 --> 21:19.310
Leave me alone.

21:19.345 --> 21:20.728
What's wrong?

21:20.763 --> 21:23.080
What's wrong?

21:23.116 --> 21:25.891
You know, you get sick,
and I took care of you.

21:25.926 --> 21:27.893
But the moment
I don't feel well,

21:27.929 --> 21:30.404
then you just disappear
and run out the door.

21:32.833 --> 21:35.492
Oh, really?

21:35.527 --> 21:37.505
Well, for your information,
I just went and got you

21:37.529 --> 21:39.663
your favorite Chinese
hot and sour soup.

21:43.785 --> 21:46.887
You mean, you went
all the way across town

21:46.922 --> 21:48.563
to bring me
my favorite Chinese soup?

21:48.599 --> 21:50.690
I knew it always
makes you feel better.

21:50.726 --> 21:54.687
- Aw, Craig. You're the best.
- Oh!

21:54.722 --> 21:58.882
- Honey, I'm sorry I misjudged you.
- It happens.

21:58.917 --> 22:00.746
I'd give you a big kiss, but I
don't wanna make you sick again.

22:00.770 --> 22:01.810
( Shudders )

22:09.737 --> 22:11.604
Where are you going?
You just got home.

22:11.639 --> 22:12.971
Back to the Chinese place.

22:13.007 --> 22:14.007
Kira took my soup.

22:19.188 --> 22:21.279
Well, that's the building

22:21.315 --> 22:22.942
where we're supposed
to hand over this clown.

22:22.966 --> 22:25.700
Oh, clown.

22:25.736 --> 22:28.019
You have a cute little
nickname for me and everything.

22:28.055 --> 22:29.457
What do you say we rethink
this whole

22:29.481 --> 22:30.722
takin' me to jail business?

22:30.758 --> 22:33.200
Oh, zip it.

22:33.235 --> 22:35.719
Well, go on. Take him in.

22:35.754 --> 22:37.780
Me?!

22:37.815 --> 22:38.981
Yeah, you.

22:39.016 --> 22:41.000
I mean, you deserve it.

22:41.035 --> 22:42.537
I gotta admit,
you outsmarted me at every turn.

22:42.561 --> 22:44.853
Yeah, then you saved my hide.

22:44.888 --> 22:46.822
If it weren't for you,
I wouldn't be here

22:46.857 --> 22:48.293
to accept the bounty.
He's all yours.

22:48.317 --> 22:49.352
Really, I think
you should take him in.

22:49.376 --> 22:50.736
- No, you take him in.
- You do it.

22:54.381 --> 22:56.548
First one to find him
takes him in.

22:56.583 --> 22:57.583
You're on.

23:00.488 --> 23:03.046
<i>Rob, your name's on TV.</i>
