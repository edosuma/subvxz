WEBVTT

00:00.453 --> 00:02.922
Dark Army told me stage two is ready.

00:03.122 --> 00:05.357
<i>I know he's dead. I
know this isn't real.</i>

00:05.458 --> 00:08.260
I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

00:08.295 --> 00:09.994
People have been forging paper records.

00:10.030 --> 00:11.040
We haven't set up a system

00:11.064 --> 00:12.597
to verify these sorts of claims.

00:12.632 --> 00:15.299
Rebuilding our database
is the only solution

00:15.334 --> 00:16.534
to this problem.

00:16.570 --> 00:18.169
Immunity is on the table

00:18.204 --> 00:19.470
in exchange for a name.

00:19.505 --> 00:20.705
That's all I care about.

00:20.740 --> 00:22.640
<i>We have to talk to them.</i>

00:22.676 --> 00:24.386
<i>They can't do this after
what happened last night.</i>

00:24.410 --> 00:26.155
<i>What, that some Mexican
restaurant got shot up?</i>

00:26.179 --> 00:27.622
<i>We can't let them get away with this.</i>

00:27.646 --> 00:29.057
They're going to get away with this.

00:29.081 --> 00:30.881
Promise me you'll let
me do the interview.

00:30.916 --> 00:32.661
You've been messing with
me for way too long.

00:32.685 --> 00:34.818
<i>It's my birthday gift to you.</i>

00:36.745 --> 00:39.923
_

00:39.992 --> 00:41.959
<i>You know, of all the gifts he sent,</i>

00:41.994 --> 00:44.359
this is the greatest we ever received.

00:44.395 --> 00:46.228
I have to know what you're planning.

00:46.263 --> 00:49.732
We were meant to be allies.

00:49.767 --> 00:51.801
We might just want the same thing,

00:51.836 --> 00:53.235
and I need to be involved.

00:53.270 --> 00:55.037
I am pretty positive you're dead wrong

00:55.073 --> 00:56.872
about that, my friend.

00:56.908 --> 01:00.609
I don't think there's anything
we could possibly agree on.

01:06.516 --> 01:08.850
Seems you've been very busy lately.

01:12.188 --> 01:14.823
I have to know what you're planning.

01:14.858 --> 01:16.725
We were meant to be allies.

01:19.194 --> 01:21.161
We might just want the same thing,

01:21.196 --> 01:23.330
and I need to be involved.

01:23.365 --> 01:25.065
I'm pretty positive you're dead wrong

01:25.101 --> 01:27.167
about that, my friend.

01:27.202 --> 01:31.438
I don't think there's anything
we could possibly agree on.

01:31.473 --> 01:33.040
I don't know what game you're playing,

01:33.075 --> 01:35.008
but I suggest you cut the bullshit.

01:35.043 --> 01:38.611
If there's nothing else,
I think we're done here.

01:38.647 --> 01:40.279
Aren't you forgetting that I know

01:40.314 --> 01:42.515
your dirty little secret?

01:42.550 --> 01:44.684
There are people close to
you that wouldn't be happy

01:44.719 --> 01:46.953
if they knew what I know.

01:52.893 --> 01:54.559
We're both too smart to allow pettiness

01:54.594 --> 01:55.694
to dictate our actions.

01:55.729 --> 01:56.895
We're better than that.

01:56.930 --> 01:59.464
Weigh the pros and cons.

01:59.499 --> 02:01.432
Do what you need to do.

02:01.468 --> 02:03.735
As soon as the tabulations
are over with,

02:03.771 --> 02:05.470
you'll know that telling
anyone about this

02:05.505 --> 02:07.572
does neither one of us any good.

02:07.607 --> 02:10.107
In fact, you'll realize
that the only thing to do

02:10.143 --> 02:13.510
in your position when it comes to me

02:13.546 --> 02:16.313
is nothing.

02:24.523 --> 02:26.690
Elliot!

02:31.396 --> 02:33.930
I believe in fate.

02:33.965 --> 02:36.365
There's a reason we met.

02:36.401 --> 02:39.803
There's something between us.
I can see it.

02:41.673 --> 02:44.306
You're only seeing
what's in front of you.

02:48.378 --> 02:51.814
You're not seeing what's above you.

I don't understand, I...

03:03.827 --> 03:05.026
I want to.

03:05.061 --> 03:06.327
Help me understand.

03:17.005 --> 03:20.573
"So much depends upon a red wheelbarrow

03:20.609 --> 03:23.210
"glazed with rainwater

03:23.245 --> 03:26.479
beside the white chickens."

03:42.396 --> 03:46.866
My father used to say that to
me all the time as a child.

03:46.901 --> 03:49.635
It was the only English he knew.

03:49.670 --> 03:53.437
Some silly poem.

03:53.473 --> 03:56.074
It meant very much to him.

04:00.180 --> 04:03.748
I use it as a reminder...

04:03.784 --> 04:06.985
a reminder of him

04:07.020 --> 04:10.387
and a reminder of what I
never wanted to become.

<i>How is the Dark Army behind this...</i>

06:38.662 --> 06:41.262
<i>whatever this is?</i>

06:57.580 --> 06:59.746
<i>It's one thing to question your mind.</i>

06:59.781 --> 07:02.582
<i>It's another to question
your eyes and ears.</i>

07:02.617 --> 07:05.152
<i>But then again, isn't it all the same,</i>

07:05.187 --> 07:08.621
<i>our senses just mediocre
inputs for our brain?</i>

07:08.657 --> 07:10.757
Come on.

07:10.792 --> 07:12.659
<i>Sure, we rely on them,</i>

07:12.694 --> 07:16.162
<i>trust they accurately portray
the real world around us,</i>

07:16.197 --> 07:18.965
<i>but what if the haunting
truth is, they can't?</i>

07:19.000 --> 07:22.168
<i>That what we perceive isn't
the real world at all</i>

07:22.203 --> 07:25.938
<i>but just our mind's best guess?</i>

07:25.974 --> 07:29.108
<i>That all we really have
is a garbled reality,</i>

07:29.143 --> 07:33.244
<i>a fuzzy picture we will
never truly make out.</i>

07:33.280 --> 07:35.981
So this is where you've been staying?

07:36.016 --> 07:38.816
God, no. We're only operating from here.

07:38.852 --> 07:41.853
Dark Army set this up?

07:41.888 --> 07:44.022
They're our partners. Of
course they set this up...

07:44.057 --> 07:46.124
for us.

07:46.159 --> 07:48.526
We needed a discreet place.

07:48.561 --> 07:51.661
Discreet? You're the most
wanted man in the world,

07:51.697 --> 07:53.797
and you're walking around like that.

07:53.832 --> 07:56.833
You really don't remember this, do you?

07:56.869 --> 07:59.436
<i>Because I'm not the one who set this up.</i>

07:59.472 --> 08:01.338
We've been through this already.

08:01.374 --> 08:04.808
<i>It must have been him. Mr. Robot.</i>

08:09.414 --> 08:13.316
Elliot...

08:13.351 --> 08:14.717
I need to know.

08:14.752 --> 08:18.187
Are you able to handle this or not?

08:18.223 --> 08:21.957
You're here under great risk, not
only to me, but to our plan.

08:21.993 --> 08:24.526
And your, um... disposition

08:24.561 --> 08:26.428
is very much concerning me.

08:28.832 --> 08:30.632
Joanna.

08:37.674 --> 08:40.741
Your wife.

08:40.775 --> 08:44.811
She's been looking for you.

08:44.847 --> 08:47.415
I'm doing what's necessary.

08:54.357 --> 08:56.524
Thank goodness they've
given us these UPSes

08:56.559 --> 08:58.458
for the power surges.

09:01.963 --> 09:04.097
Ready to look at what we accomplished?

09:35.228 --> 09:37.495
Wanna take your jacket off, hon?

09:40.133 --> 09:41.966
Don't call me hon.

09:43.570 --> 09:45.081
I just meant you have
some blood on there.

09:45.105 --> 09:46.404
I had some too, on my shirt.

09:46.439 --> 09:49.239
I know what's on my fucking jacket.

09:52.777 --> 09:54.144
I'm sorry for the loss of...

09:54.179 --> 09:55.623
I invoke my Fifth Amendment privilege

09:55.647 --> 09:57.780
against self-incrimination

09:57.816 --> 10:01.351
and respectfully decline to
answer any of your questions.

10:02.654 --> 10:04.387
I'm not asking a question.

10:04.423 --> 10:06.888
I just wanted to tell you how
sorry I am for the loss...

10:06.924 --> 10:08.335
I invoke my Fifth Amendment privilege

10:08.359 --> 10:09.958
against self-incrimination

10:09.994 --> 10:13.929
and respectfully decline to
answer any of your questions.

10:13.964 --> 10:16.132
I know you guys were close.

10:17.935 --> 10:21.403
I'm sorry you had to lose him.

10:21.439 --> 10:23.238
He was involved in one of the most

10:23.273 --> 10:26.574
notorious hacker rings in the world.

10:26.610 --> 10:30.478
Things like this come
with the territory.

10:30.514 --> 10:32.480
I invoke my Fifth Amendment privilege

10:32.516 --> 10:34.482
against self-incrimination
and respectfully...

10:34.518 --> 10:36.451
You keep trying to invoke
the Fifth Amendment,

10:36.486 --> 10:38.953
but there's this thing
called the Patriot Act

10:38.988 --> 10:42.156
that a bunch of people signed into law.

10:42.191 --> 10:44.291
You know what that means?

10:44.326 --> 10:48.662
It means that you are
not on some TV show.

10:48.697 --> 10:51.231
This isn't "Burn Notice."

10:51.267 --> 10:54.568
There are no blue skies
for you out there.

10:54.603 --> 10:56.235
Characters like you

10:56.271 --> 10:58.704
are not welcome here.

10:58.739 --> 11:01.674
As far as anyone's concerned right now,

11:01.709 --> 11:04.377
you're an enemy combatant.

11:04.412 --> 11:07.513
You don't have any rights.

11:09.250 --> 11:12.318
What the fuck do you
want me to tell you?

11:12.353 --> 11:15.253
I meet my boyfriend. We go eat.

11:15.289 --> 11:16.754
He gets shot.

11:16.790 --> 11:19.457
End of Q&A.

11:23.430 --> 11:25.197
Give me a sec.

11:39.278 --> 11:40.944
You're gonna want to talk to me.

11:43.382 --> 11:45.949
We're not so different.

11:45.984 --> 11:48.951
We're both Jersey girls.

11:52.724 --> 11:55.024
I know it's hard for you
to believe this right now,

11:55.059 --> 11:57.193
but trust me,

11:57.229 --> 12:00.930
by the end of this day, you and
I are gonna be best friends.

12:07.193 --> 12:09.528
Of all the gifts you've been sending me,

12:09.563 --> 12:11.829
I've got to say,

12:11.864 --> 12:19.864
this one got me the wettest.

12:21.907 --> 12:29.907
This one got me the wettest.

12:33.952 --> 12:37.119
So... I'm waiting.

12:39.825 --> 12:41.524
What?

12:44.062 --> 12:46.862
The phone calls...

12:46.897 --> 12:48.163
the gifts.

12:49.667 --> 12:51.734
Make me understand.

12:53.504 --> 12:58.006
I bet you feel all high
and mighty right now.

12:58.041 --> 13:00.542
That right?

13:00.578 --> 13:04.011
Do you think you're a
powerful man, Scott?

13:04.046 --> 13:07.648
Do you feel powerful?

13:07.684 --> 13:10.117
I am the CTO

13:10.152 --> 13:11.619
of the largest conglomerate...

13:11.654 --> 13:15.523
I'm not interested in your job title.

13:15.558 --> 13:18.492
I want to understand

13:18.527 --> 13:22.829
what would make a
powerful man like you...

13:22.865 --> 13:25.499
risk everything...

13:25.534 --> 13:28.167
all so he could drive me crazy?

13:35.210 --> 13:37.710
What does it matter?

13:48.689 --> 13:50.723
The morning I learned that I was

13:50.758 --> 13:53.658
promoted to CTO,

13:53.693 --> 13:56.193
I get the call.

13:56.229 --> 13:58.730
Price wanted to hold an event that night

13:58.765 --> 14:01.566
to announce my position.

14:01.601 --> 14:03.535
I thought,

14:03.570 --> 14:06.237
"I couldn't be any happier."

14:08.374 --> 14:12.208
And then Sharon walked in.

14:12.244 --> 14:13.444
She had made a...

14:13.479 --> 14:18.348
a doctor's visit...

14:18.383 --> 14:20.551
and wanted me to go with her.

14:20.586 --> 14:23.520
She had found out a month ago

14:23.556 --> 14:25.556
she was pregnant.

14:32.330 --> 14:35.364
Didn't talk.

14:35.399 --> 14:38.300
I didn't know if she was...

14:38.336 --> 14:40.803
happy or sad...

14:40.839 --> 14:43.305
or if I was happy or sad.

14:46.810 --> 14:50.011
But when we first saw that sonogram...

14:52.616 --> 14:55.016
We lit up.

14:56.419 --> 15:00.321
I thought, uh...

15:00.357 --> 15:03.791
this is gonna end up being
the best day of my life.

15:18.272 --> 15:21.508
After the funeral, I didn't know why...

15:21.543 --> 15:23.342
I couldn't understand

15:23.378 --> 15:27.547
how I could... gain and
lose everything...

15:30.184 --> 15:33.452
In one fell swoop.

15:40.561 --> 15:43.495
I wanted you to feel what I felt.

15:45.065 --> 15:47.298
I wanted to give you hope

15:47.334 --> 15:49.568
that I could step on!

15:56.910 --> 15:59.510
But I'm sorry.

16:31.742 --> 16:34.610
Ohh...

16:35.713 --> 16:37.546
You pussy.

16:37.582 --> 16:39.414
You piece of shit.

16:39.450 --> 16:42.684
I hope you rot in hell like your wife.

16:42.719 --> 16:44.564
You're mourning a woman
who, after she found out

16:44.588 --> 16:47.555
she was pregnant, was gonna
fuck my husband's brains out.

16:47.591 --> 16:49.390
I'm glad she's dead.

16:49.425 --> 16:51.525
Fuck her and her fetus corpse.

16:56.633 --> 17:00.500
Aah!

17:02.071 --> 17:04.704
No wonder your
wife was gonna cheat on you.

17:04.740 --> 17:06.439
You're weak and pathetic.

17:06.474 --> 17:09.710
That child's lucky to be dead.

17:26.426 --> 17:27.859
No...

17:29.597 --> 17:31.530
Oh, my God.

17:31.565 --> 17:33.932
Oh, my God, what have I done?

17:33.967 --> 17:36.701
Oh, my God.

17:36.737 --> 17:38.870
My God...

17:49.082 --> 17:51.081
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

17:53.629 --> 17:56.027
Vincent had a punctured lung
and a broken collarbone,

17:56.090 --> 17:58.723
but the doctors say he's gonna recover.

17:58.759 --> 18:00.559
The bad news is, he's gonna be arrested

18:00.594 --> 18:04.529
and put away for a long
time for his stunt in D.C.

18:04.564 --> 18:06.931
God.

18:06.966 --> 18:10.634
Politicians love to
teabag the rest of us.

18:10.670 --> 18:12.770
Too bad they can't take the heat.

18:12.805 --> 18:14.972
What your friend did
was domestic terrorism

18:15.007 --> 18:16.074
in the eyes of the law.

18:16.109 --> 18:17.341
Not my friend.

18:19.644 --> 18:22.645
His associates, the ones we arrested,

18:22.681 --> 18:25.148
identified you as the
ringleader of their outfit.

18:27.086 --> 18:28.885
Trust me,

18:28.920 --> 18:32.289
I am no leader.

18:32.324 --> 18:34.857
I can barely keep a guy.

18:42.800 --> 18:44.166
Look, Darlene.

18:47.305 --> 18:49.838
I don't really care
what happened in D.C.

18:49.873 --> 18:53.007
In fact, I thought it was kind of funny.

18:53.042 --> 18:56.177
I've never seen Congress move as
fast as they did on that day.

18:58.348 --> 19:00.848
But there are serious
holes in your story.

19:00.883 --> 19:03.718
And I want to work with
you to figure out why.

19:13.695 --> 19:15.095
Look.

19:15.131 --> 19:16.997
Babe.

19:17.032 --> 19:20.367
I know how this works.

19:20.402 --> 19:22.302
You get close to me,

19:22.338 --> 19:24.304
play the sympathy card,

19:24.340 --> 19:26.305
relate to me...

19:26.341 --> 19:30.309
we're just two crazy,
wacky Jersey girls.

19:30.345 --> 19:32.178
Take advantage that I did lose

19:32.213 --> 19:35.848
what probably was the love of my life.

19:35.883 --> 19:39.552
And you act like you care.

19:39.587 --> 19:41.487
But that's just it...

19:41.523 --> 19:45.123
an act.

19:45.159 --> 19:48.126
Which is sick and twisted.

19:48.162 --> 19:51.563
I'd rather you arrest me
and throw me into jail.

19:51.598 --> 19:55.200
But let's get something straight.

19:55.235 --> 19:58.703
You will not get anything out of me.

19:58.738 --> 20:02.306
So why don't you go read your manual

20:02.341 --> 20:04.675
and find the chapter on conniving cunts

20:04.710 --> 20:06.677
that don't give a fuck
about you or your feelings

20:06.712 --> 20:08.912
and then get back to me
with some real tactics?

20:08.947 --> 20:10.914
Otherwise, get me a lawyer.

20:10.949 --> 20:13.250
As far as I'm concerned,

20:13.286 --> 20:15.986
my only statement to you
is that I saw my boyfriend

20:16.021 --> 20:19.255
go brainless last night at dinner.

20:19.291 --> 20:21.424
I ordered the breakfast combo,

20:21.459 --> 20:23.626
and he stole some of my bacon.

20:26.198 --> 20:28.164
If you want any other details,

20:28.200 --> 20:30.200
the answer is suck a dick.

20:51.121 --> 20:53.020
Wait here.

21:04.867 --> 21:06.567
Remember that movie?

21:06.603 --> 21:09.236
I used to love it growing up.

21:09.271 --> 21:11.804
It's not really scary, but gory.

21:11.840 --> 21:14.974
You know how those two things
aren't really the same?

21:18.313 --> 21:20.580
This is the stuff we found
from Cisco's place.

21:20.616 --> 21:22.349
Couldn't find any tapes.

21:22.384 --> 21:24.618
Figured you were smart
enough to destroy them.

21:24.653 --> 21:27.819
We're running fingerprints and DNA.

21:27.855 --> 21:30.322
Soon we're gonna figure out
if those fsociety videos

21:30.358 --> 21:33.292
were filmed using this camera.

21:33.327 --> 21:35.394
If we find your DNA on that stuff...

21:37.898 --> 21:39.931
I don't know...

21:39.967 --> 21:41.800
you tell me how that looks.

21:44.237 --> 21:47.138
As far as your fsociety
videos are concerned,

21:47.173 --> 21:49.307
it looks like the one
person that can help you

21:49.342 --> 21:51.509
is fucking dead.

21:51.544 --> 21:53.278
As far as I'm concerned,

21:53.313 --> 21:56.814
Cisco and I were into
filming some freaky shit.

21:56.849 --> 22:00.350
Is that a matter of
national security too, hon?

22:06.191 --> 22:07.991
Then there's this.

22:08.026 --> 22:12.529
Remember your buddy, Xander Jones?

22:12.564 --> 22:15.198
According to him, you guys
had a sexual relationship.

22:16.501 --> 22:19.067
Dude, are you just gonna

22:19.103 --> 22:21.637
slut shame me all day?

22:21.673 --> 22:23.372
Is that really all you got?

22:23.408 --> 22:26.074
He also said that you were
the one that stole his gun.

22:26.110 --> 22:28.344
Well, I can't prove that, obviously,

22:28.379 --> 22:31.246
because your fingerprints
weren't on his safe.

22:31.282 --> 22:34.582
I figured you'd be crafty
enough to clean up afterward.

22:36.586 --> 22:39.220
What is funny, though,

22:39.255 --> 22:42.557
is that this casing is linked
to the Fun Society arcade.

22:52.034 --> 22:54.668
Darlene...

22:54.704 --> 22:57.771
You sure you still don't
want to talk to me?

23:11.953 --> 23:13.219
What do you think?

23:16.123 --> 23:18.391
<i>They're planning something.</i>

23:18.426 --> 23:21.060
<i>Mr. Robot, Tyrell, Dark
Army, and Whiterose</i>

23:21.095 --> 23:23.295
<i>are in cahoots to plan something big.</i>

23:23.331 --> 23:27.265
<i>And the worst part?
They all think it's me.</i>

23:27.300 --> 23:29.701
<i>They all think I'm the ringleader,</i>

23:29.737 --> 23:31.570
<i>the one in charge,</i>

23:31.605 --> 23:33.972
<i>and I have no idea what it is.</i>

23:34.007 --> 23:36.908
This place is Mount Olympus.

23:38.479 --> 23:40.746
We are prime.

23:40.781 --> 23:43.213
We're ready!

23:46.419 --> 23:48.486
<i>These are blueprints for a building</i>

23:48.521 --> 23:49.953
<i>and a disassembled firmware</i>

23:49.989 --> 23:52.556
<i>for an uninterruptible power supply,</i>

23:52.592 --> 23:56.293
<i>but I can't understand much past that.</i>

23:56.328 --> 23:58.561
<i>I'm not sure what the play is.</i>

23:58.597 --> 24:00.764
<i>I could ask him,</i>

24:00.799 --> 24:02.766
<i>but who am I really asking?</i>

24:02.801 --> 24:05.902
Elliot, look over here.

24:23.888 --> 24:26.021
Paper docs are coming in from all over,

24:26.056 --> 24:29.425
slowly but surely.

24:29.460 --> 24:31.427
<i>The blueprints.</i>

24:31.462 --> 24:33.628
<i>Is that the building?</i>

24:33.663 --> 24:36.196
<i>The offline version?</i>

24:37.801 --> 24:42.102
17 of 71 facilities around
the country so far.

24:42.138 --> 24:43.604
Within the next month,

24:43.640 --> 24:46.808
they'll have all the
paper documents here.

24:46.843 --> 24:49.283
I thought we were gonna have to
deal with multiple facilities,

24:49.312 --> 24:52.111
but they're making it easier for
us by moving it all to one.

24:52.147 --> 24:54.113
<i>This is where the paper
records are going.</i>

24:54.149 --> 24:56.115
<i>They're trying to rebuild the database.</i>

24:56.151 --> 24:58.718
<i>Titles and deeds, the bloodline
of all real property</i>

24:58.754 --> 25:00.454
<i>in this country.</i>

25:00.489 --> 25:02.322
<i>This is how they're surviving the hack.</i>

25:02.357 --> 25:04.157
When our malware executes,

25:04.192 --> 25:05.659
their whole program...

25:05.694 --> 25:08.494
Our malware?

25:08.529 --> 25:10.195
What malware?

25:10.230 --> 25:12.197
Oh, you orchestrated it beautifully.

25:12.232 --> 25:14.467
When the hacked firmware...

25:14.502 --> 25:16.502
Designed to override the safety limits

25:16.537 --> 25:19.004
on the UPS devices

25:19.039 --> 25:24.075
and overcharge the lead acid
batteries in the battery room...

25:24.110 --> 25:26.878
filling the space up with hydrogen gas.

25:26.913 --> 25:31.182
After breaking the fans and
cutting off backup power,

25:31.217 --> 25:32.817
the malicious firmware

25:32.853 --> 25:36.754
repeatedly re-engages the
UPS autotransformer,

25:36.790 --> 25:39.924
creating a spark to ignite an explosion.

25:42.528 --> 25:45.328
There are enough batteries to
produce enough hydrogen gas

25:45.364 --> 25:47.063
to level the building.

25:47.099 --> 25:48.866
When you hacked Evil Corp,

25:48.901 --> 25:51.935
you gave us access to the backdoor.

25:51.971 --> 25:54.270
You made it possible
for us to infect them.

25:54.306 --> 25:56.840
<i>I coded the femtocell
malware for Darlene.</i>

25:56.876 --> 25:59.074
<i>But it wasn't supposed to be for this.</i>

25:59.110 --> 26:01.878
The conference call leak, I must admit,

26:01.913 --> 26:06.415
was quite cute... a nice distraction.

26:06.450 --> 26:08.851
But this...

26:08.887 --> 26:10.352
is for us.

26:15.559 --> 26:17.392
All of us.

26:22.766 --> 26:25.466
I'm gonna rip his fuckin' face off!

26:25.502 --> 26:27.636
This fucker thinks he can hurt my girl.

26:27.671 --> 26:29.470
What's his address?

26:29.506 --> 26:31.739
Tell me his address, 'cause
I'm gonna go find him,

26:31.774 --> 26:33.440
and I'm gonna fuckin' kill him.

26:36.345 --> 26:38.478
Are you done?

26:40.182 --> 26:41.815
If you're serious about punishing him...

26:41.851 --> 26:43.083
I am. I am.

26:45.354 --> 26:47.454
Just tell me what to do,
and I'll fuckin' do it.

26:47.489 --> 26:49.255
I'll do it.

26:49.290 --> 26:50.590
No questions asked.

26:50.625 --> 26:52.124
- Just...
- Shh.

26:54.663 --> 26:58.097
If you are serious about punishing him,

26:58.132 --> 27:01.568
then you can do one thing for me.

27:01.603 --> 27:03.302
What? Anything. Say the word.

27:07.507 --> 27:09.474
You remember the night we met

27:09.509 --> 27:12.010
at the E Corp party?

27:12.046 --> 27:14.813
Yeah.

27:14.848 --> 27:16.414
You were tending the bar that night.

27:16.450 --> 27:20.085
You stayed late to clean up.

27:20.120 --> 27:22.120
Yeah, that's what we
always do after the...

27:22.155 --> 27:24.021
Then you saw Scott

27:24.057 --> 27:27.658
coming down from the stairwell
leading to the roof.

27:27.694 --> 27:32.463
He was disheveled, out
of breath, sweaty.

27:34.033 --> 27:38.268
You were about to ask him
if he needed anything,

27:38.304 --> 27:43.372
but he was in such a hurry, he
left without saying a word.

27:43.408 --> 27:44.808
What are you talking about?

27:44.843 --> 27:47.143
I didn't see anything like that.

27:47.178 --> 27:51.014
Yes, you did.

27:51.049 --> 27:53.549
No.

27:53.585 --> 27:56.619
I remember because the cops
were asking every one of us

27:56.654 --> 28:00.288
questions about that night,
and like I told them...

28:00.324 --> 28:02.357
cleaned up my station, and I went home.

28:02.392 --> 28:05.160
Derek, you said you were
serious about punishing him.

28:05.195 --> 28:07.730
Yeah, but Joanna...

28:07.765 --> 28:10.232
Look at my face, Derek.

28:10.267 --> 28:11.834
You want the man that did this to me

28:11.869 --> 28:14.002
to do what he did and get away with it?

28:14.037 --> 28:15.236
But Joanna, I...

28:15.271 --> 28:17.705
Once you tell the cops your story,

28:17.741 --> 28:20.508
they're gonna ask you why
you're just now confessing

28:20.543 --> 28:23.210
after months of silence.

28:23.246 --> 28:26.648
You're gonna tell them
that you were scared...

28:26.683 --> 28:30.251
that Scott Knowles intimidated you.

28:30.286 --> 28:32.318
That when Tyrell went missing,

28:32.354 --> 28:36.556
you didn't think any of
that mattered anymore.

28:36.591 --> 28:39.126
But your conscience got
the better of you.

28:42.607 --> 28:46.275
This is how we win.

28:46.568 --> 28:48.801
This is how we punish him.

28:50.538 --> 28:52.471
You understand?

28:56.310 --> 28:57.810
Thank you.

29:00.108 --> 29:02.108
Thank you for protecting me.

29:07.954 --> 29:10.421
Of course, babe. I love you.

29:17.879 --> 29:20.412
Now, let's go over it again.

29:21.575 --> 29:24.065
- We can't do this.
- You want us to stay on target?

29:24.090 --> 29:27.292
This is the target. This
gets us to the top.

29:27.926 --> 29:29.693
I know we've been operating
under top secret

29:29.729 --> 29:31.862
on this program, but I
think it's worth the risk.

29:31.897 --> 29:33.896
This girl's being a wise-ass.

29:34.207 --> 29:36.041
She thinks she's smarter than we are.

29:36.076 --> 29:39.011
That's because so far she has been.

29:39.046 --> 29:41.212
We got to show her we're smarter.

29:41.248 --> 29:43.015
Unless she thinks we're worthy,

29:43.050 --> 29:45.417
none of this is gonna fly.

29:45.452 --> 29:47.385
Just trying to sidestep
the mines, like you said.

29:47.421 --> 29:49.521
We've been building this
plan for three months.

29:49.557 --> 29:51.722
Look around you.

29:51.758 --> 29:54.525
All our leads are getting
killed and disappearing.

29:54.561 --> 29:57.028
We've lost three suspects.

29:57.063 --> 29:59.396
Dark Army's cleaning house.

29:59.432 --> 30:02.767
So that must mean something
is about to go down.

30:02.802 --> 30:04.569
Our window is closing.

30:04.604 --> 30:06.604
Every lead we've been
following up to this point

30:06.639 --> 30:08.071
has led to a dead end.

30:08.106 --> 30:11.875
Yeah, I'm gonna bring
the ADIC in on this.

30:11.911 --> 30:14.712
Please, you're gonna let
him try and flip her?

30:14.746 --> 30:17.213
She's gonna shut down.

30:17.248 --> 30:18.682
I'm right for this.

30:18.717 --> 30:21.250
Then I'm gonna go in with you.

30:23.755 --> 30:25.153
Let me do it alone.

30:29.326 --> 30:30.659
I know her.

30:33.397 --> 30:34.964
I am her.

30:38.836 --> 30:41.636
And if we're doing this,

30:41.671 --> 30:44.138
we're doing this now.

31:02.190 --> 31:05.458
We have 6,332 agents

31:05.494 --> 31:09.062
working on just this case alone.

31:09.098 --> 31:10.731
It's the hardest case
I've ever worked on

31:10.766 --> 31:14.567
and probably the hardest
one I ever will.

31:14.603 --> 31:15.801
Swear to God, the only reason

31:15.837 --> 31:18.037
why I think I've gotten this far...

31:21.542 --> 31:24.744
Is because I have no life.

31:26.881 --> 31:30.449
It's the only thing I've
been able to think about.

31:30.484 --> 31:32.784
Now I'm sitting here with you...

31:35.022 --> 31:36.554
In this awful room.

31:39.159 --> 31:42.761
And no matter what story gets
written in the final analysis,

31:42.796 --> 31:45.697
we've both been a part

31:45.732 --> 31:50.701
of one of the biggest
events in world history.

31:50.736 --> 31:53.303
Believe what you want.

31:53.338 --> 31:56.439
But neither you nor I

31:56.475 --> 31:59.009
are special.

31:59.045 --> 32:01.545
I've already learned that lesson.

32:09.821 --> 32:13.522
If you're open to changing your mind,

32:13.558 --> 32:15.925
I'd like to show you something.

32:17.729 --> 32:19.162
Come with me.

32:29.406 --> 32:32.074
You're a lot more
special than you think.

33:48.414 --> 33:53.150
Sure, the strategy was risky, but...

33:53.185 --> 33:55.118
we knew we only had one shot.

34:00.025 --> 34:03.593
If we rounded everyone up, guns blazing,

34:03.628 --> 34:07.930
we thought we would never
get the man in the middle.

34:07.965 --> 34:10.599
And with the stakes being this high,

34:10.634 --> 34:12.101
it was imperative that we got him

34:12.136 --> 34:14.170
before he knew we were getting him.

34:19.177 --> 34:21.277
So we sat back

34:21.312 --> 34:24.545
and waited.

34:24.580 --> 34:26.547
They call it the python approach.

34:28.918 --> 34:32.286
They'll lie in wait

34:32.322 --> 34:36.724
for the right moment to strike.

34:36.759 --> 34:41.195
You know some can go up
to a year without eating?

34:44.033 --> 34:46.033
The patient predator.

34:52.007 --> 34:54.373
And then Romero's death
made you all scurry.

34:56.911 --> 35:01.214
Funny enough, you thought
Dark Army was involved.

35:01.249 --> 35:04.483
As it turns out, it was
just a stray bullet

35:04.518 --> 35:07.486
from the neighbor next door.

35:07.521 --> 35:09.722
Freak accident.

36:26.529 --> 36:28.662
You've got to be fucking kidding me.

36:32.279 --> 36:33.795
<i>I've tried everything.</i>

36:33.951 --> 36:36.184
<i>I fought him. I OD'd on Adderall.</i>

36:36.334 --> 36:40.137
<i>I made peace with him. I
even got myself arrested.</i>

36:40.172 --> 36:43.740
<i>No matter what I do,
he always finds a way.</i>

36:43.776 --> 36:44.908
<i>Why?</i>

36:44.943 --> 36:46.609
<i>That's all I want to know.</i>

36:46.645 --> 36:50.013
Why is it so important
for you to torment me?

36:50.049 --> 36:53.816
What is it that you care so much about?

36:53.851 --> 36:55.350
What's this all for?

36:55.386 --> 36:56.919
I'm not tormenting you.

36:56.954 --> 36:58.587
After everything you've put me through,

36:58.622 --> 36:59.855
you continue to lie?

36:59.891 --> 37:01.256
I didn't lie to you.

37:01.292 --> 37:02.758
He's alive, man!

37:02.794 --> 37:04.226
He's sitting right fucking there!

37:06.064 --> 37:07.929
You made a plan with the Dark Army.

37:07.964 --> 37:09.164
When was that?

37:09.199 --> 37:10.464
The night of the hack?

37:10.500 --> 37:12.667
What is stage two?

37:12.703 --> 37:14.268
The femtocell, the backdoor?

37:14.304 --> 37:16.337
You planned all of that with him?

37:16.372 --> 37:17.612
You can't look at it like this.

37:17.640 --> 37:19.207
You're me. I'm you.

37:19.242 --> 37:20.842
You figured that out.
We're the same guy.

37:20.877 --> 37:22.021
Everything you're blaming me for

37:22.045 --> 37:23.277
you're blaming yourself for.

37:23.313 --> 37:25.112
Stop talking in circles.

37:25.147 --> 37:27.347
You got Whiterose to
get us out of prison.

37:27.382 --> 37:29.482
The release... that was you.

37:29.518 --> 37:30.984
You somehow communicated with them.

37:31.020 --> 37:32.552
It's what you wanted.

37:32.588 --> 37:34.199
You said to Darlene before
we started this thing

37:34.223 --> 37:35.233
that we had to go all the way.

37:35.257 --> 37:36.690
It was all part of the plan.

37:36.726 --> 37:38.366
Otherwise, what was the
point of the hack?

37:38.393 --> 37:41.828
If we were going to do this,
we had to go all the way.

37:41.863 --> 37:43.395
And that, Elliot, is what I want.

37:43.431 --> 37:45.331
It's what you asked me here for.

37:45.366 --> 37:47.734
Then tell me, what is that, exactly?

37:47.769 --> 37:49.568
What is "all the way"?

37:49.604 --> 37:51.537
This is where we get into trouble.

37:51.572 --> 37:53.873
You're meant to know only
as much as you can handle.

37:53.908 --> 37:55.541
When you wander outside of your realm

37:55.576 --> 37:57.777
is when we end up fighting.

38:03.683 --> 38:05.516
Are you...

38:05.552 --> 38:07.585
you distracting me right now?

38:15.762 --> 38:18.595
What are you doing?

38:18.631 --> 38:20.998
I'm hacking the firmware
like we discussed.

38:21.033 --> 38:25.202
We didn't discuss shit.

38:25.238 --> 38:26.703
We're not hacking anything.

38:26.739 --> 38:29.439
This will level that
building and kill people.

38:29.475 --> 38:31.275
Elliot, you need to leave
that computer alone.

38:31.310 --> 38:33.009
- I'm confused.
- It's over.

38:33.044 --> 38:34.410
I'm deleting the malware.

38:34.445 --> 38:35.845
Elliot, I wouldn't do that.

38:35.881 --> 38:37.213
You can't delete that.

38:37.249 --> 38:38.748
Not only am I gonna delete it,

38:38.784 --> 38:40.283
I'm gonna get rid of the backdoor.

38:40.318 --> 38:42.518
You do that, and everything
we worked for is gone.

38:42.553 --> 38:44.020
Elliot, I am warning you...

38:44.055 --> 38:45.255
This isn't what I want.

38:45.290 --> 38:46.722
I want it shut down.

38:46.758 --> 38:49.025
But this was your idea.

38:55.565 --> 38:57.132
Leave the computer alone!

38:57.168 --> 38:58.466
He's not gonna let you do this.

38:58.502 --> 38:59.835
Trust me.

39:23.659 --> 39:25.591
I don't know what's gotten into you.

39:25.627 --> 39:27.760
We're supposed to be gods together,

39:27.796 --> 39:30.430
and yet you want to destroy our destiny?

39:30.465 --> 39:33.967
You're not making sense.

39:34.002 --> 39:35.902
Elliot, listen to him.

39:35.938 --> 39:37.337
Walk away from the computer.

39:49.183 --> 39:51.283
You're the same.

39:52.954 --> 39:55.154
What the fuck
are you talking about?

39:55.189 --> 39:57.022
We are definitely not the same!

39:57.058 --> 39:58.990
Back away from the computer.

40:03.129 --> 40:09.033
<i>This is just another of Mr.
Robot's mind tricks.</i>

40:09.069 --> 40:10.668
No.

40:10.703 --> 40:13.371
Elliot...

40:13.406 --> 40:15.973
I don't want to shoot you, but I will.

40:16.008 --> 40:19.209
Elliot, listen to him.

40:19.245 --> 40:22.645
He's not holding a gun.

40:22.681 --> 40:24.314
He's not even there.

40:24.350 --> 40:26.516
Elliot, you need to listen to him

40:26.551 --> 40:29.652
and step away from the computer!

40:29.688 --> 40:31.788
Touch that keyboard,
and I will shoot you.

40:34.525 --> 40:36.359
No.

40:40.831 --> 40:43.132
He won't.

40:43.167 --> 40:44.733
He can't.

40:47.939 --> 40:50.005
He doesn't exist.

40:52.742 --> 40:55.810
I'm the only one that exists.

41:00.918 --> 41:05.153
It's time to finally take back control.

41:12.895 --> 41:15.429
Real control.

41:45.159 --> 41:47.259
Ah...

42:17.356 --> 42:19.422
You know, when you gave me this,

42:19.458 --> 42:23.059
you said to stop anyone who
gets in the way of our plan.

42:23.095 --> 42:27.497
I didn't know what you meant,
but now it's very clear.

42:27.532 --> 42:31.233
You did this to yourself, Elliot.

42:31.268 --> 42:35.104
You asked earlier what "all the way" is.

42:35.139 --> 42:37.939
This is it.

42:37.975 --> 42:40.142
Sorry, kiddo.

42:40.177 --> 42:43.578
I couldn't
let anyone stop this...

42:43.614 --> 42:45.947
including us.

42:54.863 --> 42:56.668
<i>Thanks for staying with us, Codyites.</i>

42:57.731 --> 43:00.365
<i>There's a lot to get to tonight.</i>

43:02.252 --> 43:04.852
<i>Look, all we do here is...</i>

43:04.887 --> 43:07.554
<i>is we try and bring you the truth.</i>

43:09.283 --> 43:11.150
<i>And they're trying to take that away.</i>

43:11.193 --> 43:13.093
<i>They
tried to take it away.</i>

43:13.129 --> 43:15.107
<i>Some of you might notice your
lights flickering tonight.</i>

43:15.131 --> 43:16.730
<i>Now, the fa...</i>

43:19.768 --> 43:22.769
Hello?

43:22.804 --> 43:25.972
Don't worry. It's Angela.

43:26.007 --> 43:28.440
Tyrell?

43:28.476 --> 43:30.977
Tyrell, are you there?

43:31.012 --> 43:32.979
It's okay.

43:33.014 --> 43:34.580
They told me you would be calling.

43:34.615 --> 43:37.315
This is a secure line.

43:37.350 --> 43:40.285
Are you with Elliot right now?

43:40.320 --> 43:41.452
<i>Yes.</i>

43:41.488 --> 43:43.088
Okay, I'm on my way.

43:43.123 --> 43:44.790
Don't let anyone near him.

43:44.825 --> 43:48.960
I should be the first person
he sees when he wakes up.

43:48.996 --> 43:51.529
<i>Okay.</i>

43:51.564 --> 43:55.266
Tyrell, you did what needed to be done.

43:55.301 --> 43:57.668
<i>I love him.</i>

43:59.505 --> 44:01.738
I do too.

44:50.920 --> 44:54.255
♪
Both of us lonely ♪

45:24.396 --> 45:27.030
Have you given any more
thought to what I said?

45:27.055 --> 45:30.091
I don't want to discuss this.

45:30.119 --> 45:32.420
- Mobley...
- Fredrick.

45:34.624 --> 45:37.657
Seriously, Fredrick,

45:37.692 --> 45:40.126
what if we could?

45:40.161 --> 45:42.094
This might work.

45:42.130 --> 45:44.397
And also, it might not.

45:44.433 --> 45:47.266
I've taken enough risks
for one lifetime.

45:47.302 --> 45:49.903
I don't want to discuss it anymore.

45:52.640 --> 45:54.673
But what if we could
generate the keys...

45:54.708 --> 45:57.743
Tanya...

45:57.778 --> 46:01.947
Will you just please shut up?

46:01.982 --> 46:03.749
What? This is important.

46:03.784 --> 46:06.184
- We need to talk about it.
- Change the subject.

46:06.219 --> 46:09.454
I don't want to change the subject.

46:09.489 --> 46:12.289
I miss my family.

46:12.325 --> 46:13.858
I don't want to live here.

46:13.893 --> 46:15.827
Oh, come on, it's nice out here.

46:15.862 --> 46:18.496
You know, uh... look,
no more bad winters.

46:18.531 --> 46:21.966
Hardly rains. That's great.

46:22.001 --> 46:24.168
I hate your friend. He's a dick.

46:24.203 --> 46:25.937
No, I-I told you.

46:25.972 --> 46:27.871
He did not know you
were in the bathroom.

46:27.906 --> 46:31.341
Trust me, he knew exactly
what he was doing.

46:31.376 --> 46:33.109
Weirdo. Save up enough money,

46:33.144 --> 46:35.211
and you'll be able to get
your own place eventually.

46:35.246 --> 46:36.691
Okay? Apartments here are dirt cheap.

46:36.715 --> 46:38.849
Won't be that long.

46:38.884 --> 46:42.185
Just be thankful he was
able to get us this job.

46:45.590 --> 46:47.155
Hey, what flavor did you get again?

46:47.191 --> 46:50.025
You want to trade?

46:50.060 --> 46:52.928
Please, just look at it.

46:55.032 --> 46:57.900
Okay, so... so what? Say I did.

46:57.935 --> 47:00.402
Then what?

47:00.437 --> 47:03.705
If what I discovered is real,
do you know what that means?

47:03.740 --> 47:06.975
Yeah, I know exactly what it means.

47:07.010 --> 47:08.409
Yeah. It means we could

47:08.444 --> 47:10.879
potentially undo this whole thing.

47:10.914 --> 47:13.715
Put everything back the way it was.

47:13.750 --> 47:17.051
I know. I know.

47:17.086 --> 47:19.586
Please.

47:19.622 --> 47:20.988
Just look at what I found.

47:21.023 --> 47:22.422
Excuse me.

47:22.457 --> 47:24.725
Oh, sorry, dude. We're on a break.

47:24.760 --> 47:27.895
Yeah, I just had a quick question.

47:27.930 --> 47:32.065
Do you have the time?
