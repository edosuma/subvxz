WEBVTT

00:11.620 --> 00:13.206
Where were wendy and keith?

00:13.241 --> 00:14.344
Did they quit?

00:14.379 --> 00:18.758
Maybe they decided to go Home.

00:18.793 --> 00:21.034
They're still at extinction.

00:21.068 --> 00:24.827
After my first tribal there
Were two idiots, one was joe,

00:24.862 --> 00:26.137
The next one was me.

00:26.172 --> 00:28.931
We were the only two out of the
Original cambo kama that were in.

00:28.965 --> 00:36.965
Dark about tonight's vote, so it
Pretty much suction right now.

00:40.965 --> 00:44.655
If I have to work with kama
And play nice, I can do, that.

00:44.689 --> 00:46.241
But I have no allegiances.

00:46.275 --> 00:49.413
I don't care where I go at this
Point, but I am only going with.

00:49.448 --> 00:55.068
The numbers.

00:55.103 --> 00:55.965
Seriously.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.137
Can I have a hug?

00:57.172 --> 00:58.551
Thank you.

00:58.586 --> 00:59.482
Thank you!

00:59.517 --> 01:01.586
By saving david and rick,
They trust me.

01:01.620 --> 01:02.172
They're loyal.

01:02.206 --> 01:06.724
They owe me a major one.

01:06.758 --> 01:08.862
I had three votes.

01:08.896 --> 01:09.931
I thought so.

01:09.965 --> 01:11.275
That's what I figured.

01:11.310 --> 01:13.655
Not only did they want to do It.

01:13.689 --> 01:14.689
They were evil about it.

01:14.724 --> 01:16.482
Like, no remorse whatsoever.

01:16.517 --> 01:19.931
I really wanted rick and david
To be so angry with the members.

01:19.965 --> 01:22.286
Of lesu, because I didn't want
Them for a second to think about.

01:22.310 --> 01:25.379
Going back and work with them,
And the cavern I have built with.

01:25.413 --> 01:30.103
Lesu is so strong, they're not
Going to cross.

01:30.137 --> 01:34.310
It.

01:34.344 --> 01:36.389
If we just stay the course,
Three votes from now, you know.

01:36.413 --> 01:37.517
Where that puts you?

01:37.551 --> 01:39.448
Family visit.

01:39.482 --> 01:40.586
Hopefully.

01:40.620 --> 01:48.620
I can't wait to be loyal with
You guys.

01:48.758 --> 01:51.758
They made us go against each
Other.

01:56.068 --> 01:58.137
It is.

01:58.172 --> 02:02.931
It is aurora.

02:08.758 --> 02:10.148
Right now we need each other for
The next two votes.

02:10.172 --> 02:11.379
Otherwise, we're all done.

02:11.413 --> 02:15.482
If we patch those wounds with
Devyns and david, it may bring

02:15.517 --> 02:19.413
Aurora in, weak say... maybe we
Can go to rocks.

02:19.448 --> 02:21.551
We can gamble on rocks.

02:21.586 --> 02:29.586
If we don't go to rocks, we're
Going home anyway.

02:33.482 --> 02:36.758
20 more days and counting.

02:36.793 --> 02:41.793
19 left to go.

02:41.827 --> 02:42.413
Stupid game.

02:42.448 --> 02:44.724
I love it so much.

02:44.758 --> 02:45.655
Damn, it gets harder.

02:45.689 --> 02:48.724
Just trying to keep it all
Together.

02:48.758 --> 02:55.724
That's all you gotta do, just
Keep it... keep it together.

02:55.758 --> 02:59.758
Figure it out.

03:01.000 --> 03:07.074

Of puzzle pieces, then race to.

Puzzle.

03:47.862 --> 03:49.793

Playing for?

03:49.827 --> 03:51.665

08:23.862 --> 08:26.517
Everyone's upset, but I'm
Sitting back thinking this is.

08:26.551 --> 08:27.793
Awesome.

08:27.827 --> 08:29.838
Because the last thing I want is
For wentworth and lauren to be.

08:29.862 --> 08:31.000
Strong.

08:31.034 --> 08:32.871
I want them to be lost and
Lonely because I'm the puppet.

08:32.895 --> 08:33.724
Master.

08:33.758 --> 08:36.241

08:44.034 --> 08:45.655
Good reward, you guys!

08:45.689 --> 08:47.517
This is so good, you guys.

08:47.551 --> 08:50.275
This is best chinese food
I've ever had in my whole life.

08:50.310 --> 08:51.827
I'm so happy right now.

08:51.862 --> 08:55.551
Guys, I know I just met you a
New days ago and this might be.

08:55.586 --> 08:56.482
Fast, but I love you guys.

08:56.517 --> 08:57.448
We love you!

08:57.482 --> 08:58.793
My god!

08:58.827 --> 09:01.034
My god!

09:01.068 --> 09:05.517
I feel so bad because I now
Know what it feels like to lose.

09:05.551 --> 09:05.862
A reward.

09:05.896 --> 09:06.586
Yeah.

09:06.620 --> 09:07.872
We have not won a damn thing.

09:07.896 --> 09:08.689
No.

09:08.724 --> 09:10.379
Do you know what would be
Awesome?

09:10.413 --> 09:13.448
If a chicken walked through this
Camp right now and just sat.

09:13.482 --> 09:13.827
Here.

09:13.862 --> 09:15.103
God.

09:15.137 --> 09:17.862
It's like, "Hey, guys, I heard
What happened at the challenge."

09:17.896 --> 09:19.034
Eat me."

09:19.068 --> 09:22.275
y just needed some sort of
Food, and some sort of win.

09:22.310 --> 09:26.620
I am so freaking hungry.

09:26.655 --> 09:29.517
We killed that food.

09:29.551 --> 09:31.551
Good reward, guys!

09:31.586 --> 09:32.931
That was a good one!

09:32.965 --> 09:36.068
I feel like I am cursed.

09:36.103 --> 09:39.551
Like, can't win anything.

09:39.586 --> 09:42.344
I just want to apologize for
Voting for you last night.

09:42.379 --> 09:43.793
No, no, no.

09:43.827 --> 09:44.931
Hey, and I'm sorry, too.

09:44.965 --> 09:46.448
Yeah, all good.

09:46.482 --> 09:49.758
At this point, I'm kind of on
The bottom with wardog and

09:49.793 --> 09:50.862
Lauren.

09:50.896 --> 09:53.068
I don't know where rick and
David stand completely.

09:53.103 --> 09:55.551
But we've got to bury the
Hatchet.

09:55.586 --> 09:57.310
It's dumb.

09:57.344 --> 10:03.206
The leser group is totally going
After each other and forgetting.

10:03.241 --> 10:06.551
There is this whole kamaization
Swaigz.

10:06.586 --> 10:09.689
It's what kama wants to run the
Game.

10:09.724 --> 10:17.655
If the lesu five come together
And pull in... the lesu five.

10:17.689 --> 10:21.586
Come together and pull in
Aurora, we have six people to.

10:21.620 --> 10:24.413
Try and vote one of these kama
People out.

10:24.448 --> 10:27.172
Here's the deal... you know how
This game works.

10:27.206 --> 10:30.413
Either we come together and try
To take one of them out, or.

10:30.448 --> 10:33.896
We're probably going to go one
By one.

10:33.931 --> 10:35.137
It's.

10:35.172 --> 10:38.344
Obviously, I'm sure they told
You guys like you are working.

10:38.379 --> 10:39.448
With us now, or whatever.

10:39.482 --> 10:41.068
Here's my thing, though.

10:41.103 --> 10:43.931
Once devin and wardog, that's
Five.

10:43.965 --> 10:44.379
Aurora.

10:44.413 --> 10:46.241
Aurora?

10:46.275 --> 10:48.448
You really think she's keen on
That?

10:48.482 --> 10:51.068
I mean, I know she's on the
Bottom.

10:51.103 --> 10:54.551
Number one, obviously, being
Left out.

10:54.586 --> 10:57.482
Because it would have been so
Easy to tell me before.

10:57.517 --> 11:01.241
So I don't feel like any of them
Trust me.

11:01.275 --> 11:03.275
I've heard no one say your Name.

11:03.310 --> 11:07.275
I mean, I know our goal is we've
Got to get to this level, but

11:07.310 --> 11:10.896
I'd like us to stay longer than
That.

11:10.931 --> 11:12.044
Aurora feels on the outs.

11:12.068 --> 11:12.931
She is.

11:12.965 --> 11:14.448
Let's say we do have six.

11:14.482 --> 11:15.586
It would be a tie.

11:15.620 --> 11:18.344
Unless they think they have,
Like you and devins or.

11:18.379 --> 11:20.034
Something, and then try and
Split.

11:20.068 --> 11:21.448
Yeah.

11:21.482 --> 11:23.034
Then...
and then we have the numbers.

11:23.068 --> 11:24.344
Okay.

11:24.379 --> 11:25.655
Actually, I like that plan.

11:25.689 --> 11:29.310
I'm really excited about what
Wentworth is proposing because.

11:29.344 --> 11:31.206
The kama tribe are in control of
This game.

11:31.241 --> 11:33.000
I'm not in control of anything.

11:33.034 --> 11:36.620
I'm... I'm just a piece in their
Game.

11:36.655 --> 11:40.034
Especially the people who are in
Charge of tlike ron and erik.

11:40.068 --> 11:43.241
I'm sort of leaning towards
Splitting the votes over lauren.

11:43.275 --> 11:43.620
And kelley.

11:43.655 --> 11:48.862
Okay.

11:48.896 --> 11:53.758
Okay...

11:53.793 --> 11:58.413
we need to band together and
Flip this game on its head.

11:58.448 --> 12:01.034
I've just got to pull in my
Strongest alliance member, which.

12:01.068 --> 12:02.034
Is devins.

12:02.068 --> 12:03.079
That should be no problem.

12:03.103 --> 12:06.034
I'll talk to rick later,
Obviously right now now.

12:06.068 --> 12:09.172
I hope he understands there
Are no hard feelings about.

12:09.206 --> 12:10.448
Anything.

12:10.482 --> 12:14.793
So, the five lesu together.

12:14.827 --> 12:17.275
I'm dying to get back about
The old lesu.

12:17.310 --> 12:21.034
Now that I know I can trust you
Guys, I really want to get back.

12:21.068 --> 12:22.344
With you all.

12:22.379 --> 12:25.000
You... >> except they don't.

12:25.034 --> 12:26.586
Want to get back with you guys
At all?

12:26.620 --> 12:27.517
What do you mean?

12:27.551 --> 12:29.517
Why would I work with you Guys?

12:29.551 --> 12:31.896
Well, I mean...
you guys stabbed me in the.

12:31.931 --> 12:33.068
Back over and over again.

12:33.103 --> 12:34.827
I don't want to work with kelley
At all.

12:34.862 --> 12:36.517
She tried to vote me out twice.

12:36.551 --> 12:40.137
You come here for ninth or
Eighth, that's fine.

12:40.172 --> 12:42.482
I came to win the game.

12:42.517 --> 12:44.620
Why would I want to work with
Them?

12:44.655 --> 12:46.182
Because it gets you farther
In the game.

12:46.206 --> 12:48.137
I don't know that that's True.

12:48.172 --> 12:51.137
I don't know that that's true.

12:51.172 --> 12:54.275
I know it gets you furgts in the
Game and shiks things up.

12:54.310 --> 13:00.172
It was so stupid, don't come out
Here and wardog me and yell at.

13:00.206 --> 13:03.172
Me that I'm not playing the game
You think I should be playing.

13:03.206 --> 13:03.862
I'm going home.

13:03.896 --> 13:05.068
Did you come to me?

13:05.103 --> 13:06.103
Did you come to me?

13:06.137 --> 13:08.206
I don't like being barkd at.

13:08.241 --> 13:09.586
You're playing with emotions.

13:09.620 --> 13:12.379
You keep saying I'm playing
With emotions.

13:12.413 --> 13:16.517
You have playing with.

13:16.551 --> 13:17.586
Emotions.

13:17.620 --> 13:21.344
If I can't trust lesu, let's
Get in with kama.

13:21.379 --> 13:24.000
They just saved me at last
Tribal.

13:24.034 --> 13:26.689
Don't bark at me that I'm not
Playing the game because I'm not.

13:26.724 --> 13:27.965
Doing what you want me to do.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.206
He needs david and I to swing
With them but it's not going to.

13:31.241 --> 13:32.413
Happen.

13:32.448 --> 13:35.310
You always remember one
Conversation in "Survivor," you.

13:35.344 --> 13:36.413
Will remember this one.

13:36.448 --> 13:38.241
I'm a pupet and you're a puppet.

13:38.275 --> 13:40.068
We are not driving this game.

13:40.103 --> 13:40.931
Erik is driving it.

13:40.965 --> 13:42.448
And ron is driving it.

13:42.482 --> 13:44.896
We need to navigate our own
Ships.

13:44.931 --> 13:47.068
But my way is better for me.

13:47.103 --> 13:48.896
You're not getting numbers, bro.

13:48.931 --> 13:51.206
I think you're dreaming.

13:51.241 --> 13:52.355
I think you're getting played.

13:52.379 --> 13:54.689
There's nothing more
Important than break up kama.

13:54.724 --> 14:01.896
But, unfortunately, devins is
Not on board, 100% opposed to.

14:01.931 --> 14:03.137
It.

14:03.172 --> 14:06.344
One of us is drunk right now,
But I don't know which one.

14:06.379 --> 14:07.793
I think I'm the sober one.

14:07.827 --> 14:09.379
I'm not coming to your side.

14:09.413 --> 14:10.655
Remember we have the idol.

14:10.689 --> 14:13.344
I just thought you would give
Me the half back.

14:13.379 --> 14:14.631
If you don't mind, I'd like
To hang on to it.

14:14.655 --> 14:17.896
Devin is letting emotions run to
His game, so the last thing I.

14:17.931 --> 14:22.689
Want to do is give him the half
Of the idol.

14:22.724 --> 14:26.448
It's so frustrating to have
Found someone I trust as much as

14:26.482 --> 14:30.965
I trust devins and realize I
Have to find another path.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.862
I wanted it to be with devin but
The way it's shaping up right.

14:33.896 --> 14:36.896
Now I'm not sure there's any
Hope of that.

14:53.551 --> 14:55.034
These wine bottles.

14:55.068 --> 14:56.448
All at the same time?

14:56.482 --> 14:57.793
Yeah.

14:57.827 --> 14:59.482
Honestly, I'm terrible with
Riddles.

14:59.517 --> 15:01.206
I'm even worse with maps.

15:01.241 --> 15:03.517
I was ready to take a nap.

15:03.551 --> 15:10.344
It's been rocky thus far but
Your game is still at stake.

15:10.379 --> 15:13.620
Step back and assess, an
Advantage awaits.

15:13.655 --> 15:20.413
"Step back and assess, an
Advantage awaits."

15:20.448 --> 15:22.896
did you hear about what
Happened last time?

15:24.206 --> 15:26.862
I already have my shoes on
Because I know what happens when.

15:26.896 --> 15:30.862
There's new on extinction... you
Best be running because it's.

15:30.896 --> 15:32.758
Like black friday and you better
Get the toy.

15:32.793 --> 15:35.551
If because someone here's
Going to get it.

15:35.586 --> 15:39.379
I'm coming for you, aubry.

15:39.413 --> 15:40.482
I'm coming for you.

15:40.517 --> 15:43.413
Chris, are you not going to
Get me this time, pal.

15:43.448 --> 15:47.931
It's been rocky thus far, but
Your game is still at stake.

15:47.965 --> 15:51.172
Is there a stake somewhere near
The rocks?

15:51.206 --> 15:53.689
Did you find it?

15:53.724 --> 15:55.724
Step back and assess.

15:55.758 --> 15:58.137
I've been here for three
Freaking weeks.

15:58.172 --> 16:00.206
I would just like to find
Something.

16:00.241 --> 16:01.103
"Step back."

16:01.137 --> 16:03.310
I'm not sure exactly what it
Means.

16:03.344 --> 16:03.896
There are some stairs.

16:03.931 --> 16:05.137
There are some steps.

16:05.172 --> 16:09.517
And I feel like it's right under
Everyone's nose, but I can't.

16:09.551 --> 16:14.517
Seem to find it.

16:14.551 --> 16:19.620
Everyone starts checking the
Steps.

16:19.655 --> 16:20.896
They see absolutely nothing.

16:20.931 --> 16:24.724
I took a step back, look to my
Left, there's a big hole in the.

16:24.758 --> 16:25.379
Rock wall.

16:25.413 --> 16:27.793
But I'm like, "This is mine!"

16:27.827 --> 16:31.965
"So sneaky, sneaky, like kelley
Wentworth."

16:32.000 --> 16:33.310
Nothing here.

16:33.344 --> 16:41.344
I stick my hand in, and turns
Out, there is a key and a clue.

16:41.517 --> 16:45.482
That says, "Follow the rocks to
The last in the sand, where your."

16:45.517 --> 16:46.689
Practice begins."

16:46.724 --> 16:49.724
All right.

16:49.758 --> 16:53.482
What the hell, man.

16:53.517 --> 16:58.862
I go over the rocks, get to the
Sandy beach, and I see a post.

16:58.896 --> 16:59.862
With rope.

16:59.896 --> 17:01.965
It looks like I found the
Practice advantage.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.482
And I am stoked.

17:03.517 --> 17:07.034
I've been hanging with these
Bros, listen to them talk about.

17:07.068 --> 17:09.172
How they're going to get back in
The game and win.

17:09.205 --> 17:13.103
But little do they know that the
Practice advantage even exists.

17:13.137 --> 17:17.241
And I found something else
Tucked up in the rocks... this.

17:17.275 --> 17:22.413
An extra vote for someone in the
Game.

17:22.448 --> 17:22.931
Okay.

17:22.964 --> 17:23.310
Wow.

17:23.344 --> 17:24.137
That's big.

17:24.172 --> 17:26.448
This is amazing!

17:26.482 --> 17:29.655
Now, not only do I get to
Practice to get back in the.

17:29.689 --> 17:31.758
Game, but I also have a decision
To make.

17:31.793 --> 17:35.517
I have to decide who I want to
Give this extra vote to.

17:35.551 --> 17:36.620
Loosen that.

17:36.655 --> 17:37.758
Gotta tighten here.

17:37.793 --> 17:41.000
So I might be out of sight, out
Of mind at the edge of.

17:41.034 --> 17:43.079
Extinction, but I know that the
Game is always there.

17:43.103 --> 17:47.034
And the advantage could be
Literally the key to someone's.

17:47.068 --> 17:51.793
Game.

17:59.965 --> 18:07.965
Come on in, guys!

18:10.000 --> 18:15.448
Come on in, guys!

18:15.482 --> 18:18.379
All right, shall we get to
Today's immunity challenge?

18:18.413 --> 18:18.965
Yeah!

18:19.000 --> 18:19.793
Yes!

18:19.827 --> 18:21.896
First things first, Julie.

18:21.931 --> 18:24.172
Got to take back the necklace.

18:24.206 --> 18:25.310
The frown.

18:25.344 --> 18:26.000
You can win it again.

18:26.034 --> 18:29.034
That's true.

18:29.068 --> 18:31.896
Once again, immunity is back up
For grabs.

18:31.931 --> 18:36.862
For today's challenge, you're
Going to balance on your toes.

18:36.896 --> 18:40.103
With a block wedged between your
Head and the top of the frame.

18:40.137 --> 18:45.172
The longer the challenge goes,
The more fatigued your legs will.

18:45.206 --> 18:46.206
Become.

18:46.241 --> 18:48.413
When they finally give out, your
Block will drop.

18:48.448 --> 18:49.655
You're out.

18:49.689 --> 18:54.931
Last person left standing wins
Immunity, safe from the vote.

18:54.965 --> 18:57.217
Losers, tribal council, where
Somebody will become the eighth.

18:57.241 --> 18:59.655
Person voted out of this game.

18:59.689 --> 19:00.413
Take your spots.

19:00.448 --> 19:08.137
We'll get started.

19:08.172 --> 19:10.827
All right, here we go.

19:10.862 --> 19:12.689
Everybody place your blocks
Above your head.

19:12.724 --> 19:15.413
You're going to wedge them
Between your head and the top of.

19:15.448 --> 19:19.689
The frame, which is going to
Force you to stand on your toes.

19:19.724 --> 19:23.275
That's where this challenge is
Difficult.

19:23.310 --> 19:28.896
Everybody looks good, and this
Challenge is on.

19:28.931 --> 19:31.758
And quickly, you will feel it.

19:31.793 --> 19:33.448
Somebody may drop very fast.

19:33.482 --> 19:36.379
If you lose your balance and
Touch the frame, even a little,

19:36.413 --> 19:39.517
You're out.

19:39.551 --> 19:42.827
Wardog quickly struggling to
Balance.

19:42.862 --> 19:45.655
That block falls.

19:45.689 --> 19:48.758
Within 15 seconds, wardog is the
First out.

19:48.793 --> 19:50.379
No shot at immunity.

19:50.413 --> 19:52.034
Take a spot on the bench.

19:52.068 --> 19:53.182
Wentworth already feeling it.

19:53.206 --> 19:55.172
I'm, like, shaking.

19:55.206 --> 19:59.758
22 days on "Survivor"
Is impossible to imagine.

19:59.793 --> 20:04.275
You only know what it feels like
When you are the one who has.

20:04.310 --> 20:05.413
Experienced it.

20:05.448 --> 20:09.793
That's why you're shaking
Seconds into this challenge.

20:09.827 --> 20:12.379
Wentworth really fighting to
Keep that balance.

20:12.413 --> 20:20.413
Keep digging!

20:21.379 --> 20:23.000
Erik is out.

20:23.034 --> 20:25.586
He'll talk a spot on the bench.

20:25.620 --> 20:33.482
Gavin drops out of nowhere
Purpose we're down to nine.

20:33.517 --> 20:34.965
And wentworth drops.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.241
She's out.

20:37.275 --> 20:44.413
We've already lost four of the
Fittest people in this game.

20:44.448 --> 20:49.137
Devens a sudden five of the
Fittest now.

20:49.172 --> 20:55.275
Devens joinsz the ranks of the
Fittest survivors in this.

20:55.310 --> 20:55.827
Challenge.

20:55.862 --> 20:58.827
We are down to seven.

20:58.862 --> 21:03.137
Julia wobbling.

21:03.172 --> 21:03.896
Julia, block drops.

21:03.931 --> 21:05.034
She's out.

21:05.068 --> 21:09.241
Down to six.

21:09.275 --> 21:11.965
My god!

21:12.000 --> 21:12.965
Ron drops.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.517
Ron is out.

21:14.551 --> 21:18.103
And we are down to five.

21:18.137 --> 21:19.655
Aah!

21:19.689 --> 21:21.137
Julie's out of the Challenge.

21:21.172 --> 21:28.275
David,
Victoria, aurora, and lauren.

21:29.862 --> 21:32.310
David, a nice Recovery.

21:32.344 --> 21:33.758
Holding that block steady.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.931
You're still looking good up
Top.

21:35.965 --> 21:37.137
Thank you.

21:37.172 --> 21:41.172
Viktorria, very calm
Right next to david, hasn't.

21:41.206 --> 21:42.724
Moved, hasn't opened her eyes.

21:42.758 --> 21:44.551
Aurora still very solid.

21:44.586 --> 21:47.379
Lauren very solid.

21:47.413 --> 21:53.102
Are we could be here for a
While.

21:53.103 --> 21:57.448
Are we could be here for a
While.

22:15.965 --> 22:20.793
25 minute in, david,
Viktorria, aurora, and lauren.

22:20.827 --> 22:27.482
Still fighting for that
Necklace.

22:27.517 --> 22:30.137
David's feet moving once again.

22:30.172 --> 22:35.103
I'm a little dizzy.

22:35.137 --> 22:38.068
First bit of movement
From lauren, just a slight.

22:38.103 --> 22:41.689
Adjustment, trying to keep from
Going numb, probably.

22:41.724 --> 22:48.137
Very dizzy.

22:48.172 --> 22:53.034
Aurora with a bit of Movement.

22:53.068 --> 22:57.172
Victoria still absolutely solid.

22:57.206 --> 23:01.827
Damn the skinny girls.

23:01.862 --> 23:03.448
Aah!

23:03.482 --> 23:04.448
David drops.

23:04.482 --> 23:07.620
Thanks, guys.

23:07.655 --> 23:09.448
That's how easily it Can happen.

23:09.482 --> 23:13.068
A slight change in the pressure
From your head to that block to.

23:13.103 --> 23:15.034
The top of the frame.

23:15.068 --> 23:18.965
And you're out.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.034
I can't see anything.

23:21.068 --> 23:28.344
I'm about to black out.

23:28.379 --> 23:30.137
My god!

23:30.172 --> 23:31.241
My god!

23:31.275 --> 23:32.448
Medical, medical!

23:32.482 --> 23:33.137
What happened?

23:33.172 --> 23:34.724
Iauren passed out.

23:34.758 --> 23:35.551
Just keep going.

23:35.586 --> 23:36.896
My good.

23:36.931 --> 23:39.310
She's got people around her,
Vick.

23:39.344 --> 23:40.724
She's okay.

23:40.758 --> 23:42.275
Iauren?

23:42.310 --> 23:46.275
Joe, let me know if
We need to stop this challenge.

23:46.310 --> 23:48.034
Don't worry, she's in good
Hands.

23:48.068 --> 23:49.827
For now we'll let it run.

23:49.862 --> 23:51.379
Go dr joe will let us know.

23:51.413 --> 23:52.689
Iauren, you can hear me?

23:52.724 --> 23:55.620
Victoria it's you and I.

23:55.655 --> 23:56.137
Victoria.

23:56.172 --> 23:57.034
I'm okay, aurora.

23:57.068 --> 23:58.137
I know.

23:58.172 --> 24:00.827
You know that I was the only
Person out of that vote.

24:00.862 --> 24:01.931
What did you say?

24:01.965 --> 24:04.689
I need this, just to feel
Better about our group.

24:04.724 --> 24:07.931
Pass me the orange case over
There, please.

24:07.965 --> 24:09.137
Lauren, lauren.

24:09.172 --> 24:12.172
Even now, while lawr
Sen on the ground, aurora is.

24:12.206 --> 24:13.872
Pleading with victoria to give
This to her.

24:13.896 --> 24:16.689
I was the only one left out
Of the vote, dude.

24:16.724 --> 24:18.034
Aurora, just wait.

24:18.068 --> 24:19.310
Aurora, it's not the time.

24:19.344 --> 24:20.551
Yeah, it really isn't.

24:20.586 --> 24:24.482
No, dude, second-half
Challenges are all about skinny,

24:24.517 --> 24:27.034
Lean people.

24:27.068 --> 24:30.241
It's okay.

24:30.275 --> 24:31.275
Check her pulse.

24:31.310 --> 24:32.241
Give her a moment.

24:32.275 --> 24:34.000
Hey, lauren.

24:34.034 --> 24:34.827
You just fainted.

24:34.862 --> 24:35.827
Damn it!

24:35.862 --> 24:39.931
How you feeling?

24:39.965 --> 24:43.448
Just give yourself a minute,
Lauren.

24:43.482 --> 24:46.310
You feel a bit lightheaded.

24:46.344 --> 24:48.586
Dr. Joe, you're okay Over there?

24:48.620 --> 24:49.000
Okay.

24:49.034 --> 24:49.551
Lawr sen good.

24:49.586 --> 24:50.034
She's back.

24:50.068 --> 24:51.310
You just relax.

24:51.344 --> 24:54.965
No one was left out but me,
Victoria.

24:55.000 --> 24:55.586
My god.

24:55.620 --> 24:58.103
I'm gonna losa.

24:58.137 --> 25:01.448
You want me to trust you, I
Need this.

25:01.482 --> 25:03.482
Lauren, I'm just Checking.

25:03.517 --> 25:04.172
You're good, right?

25:04.206 --> 25:05.482
Yeah, I'm just embarrassed.

25:05.517 --> 25:07.655
You just... you
Literally just dropped pup fell.

25:07.689 --> 25:08.586
Off the challenge.

25:08.620 --> 25:10.034
Well, that's embarrassing.

25:10.068 --> 25:12.413
No, I'd say that's a
Sign of a warrior.

25:12.448 --> 25:14.275
I can tell everybody you're
Okay?

25:14.310 --> 25:17.448
Yeah, I'm great.

25:17.482 --> 25:18.655
Lawr sen okay.

25:18.689 --> 25:25.034
Just get back in this.

25:25.068 --> 25:29.586
I mean, even... you hear erik
Saying, "Go, vic."

25:29.620 --> 25:37.413
No one said, "Go, aurora" again,
Vic, you want me to trust.

25:37.448 --> 25:39.517
Good luck, aurora.

25:39.551 --> 25:42.689
I don't know if that one Counts.

25:42.724 --> 25:46.103
And out of nowhere,
Victoria drops.

25:46.137 --> 25:51.103
Aurora did not have to negotiate
For individual immunity.

25:51.137 --> 25:53.172
Aurora wins immunity.

25:53.206 --> 25:56.413
Safe tonight at tribal council.

25:56.448 --> 25:59.620
Both women now trying to get
Some feeling back in their legs.

25:59.655 --> 26:06.620
Take your time.

26:06.655 --> 26:12.103
Have a seat.

26:12.137 --> 26:13.827
Yeah, yeah.

26:13.862 --> 26:14.827
I'm okay.

26:14.862 --> 26:16.827
Aurora, come on over.

26:16.862 --> 26:24.551
Aurora, safe tonight at tribal.

26:24.586 --> 26:25.275
Council.

26:25.310 --> 26:26.562
Cannot be vote out of this game.

26:26.586 --> 26:30.724
As for the rest of you, after 22
Very tough days, somebody will.

26:30.758 --> 26:33.413
Become the eighth person voted
Our the "Survivor Edge of."

26:33.448 --> 26:34.034
Extinction."

26:34.068 --> 26:35.000
It won't be you.

26:35.034 --> 26:35.827
Grab your stuff.

26:35.862 --> 26:37.758
Head back to camp.

26:37.793 --> 26:39.034
Congrats.

26:39.068 --> 26:40.344
Great job.

26:40.379 --> 26:44.206
It was really scary when I
Passed out, but I was even more.

26:44.241 --> 26:47.689
Pissed that I was on the ground
Because that means I didn't win,

26:47.724 --> 26:49.862
And it leaves me very, very
Vulnerable.

26:49.896 --> 26:52.896
But playing my idol is the
Absolute last resort.

27:05.275 --> 27:06.931
You girls were incredible.

27:06.965 --> 27:08.517
Congratulations.

27:08.551 --> 27:09.724
That was awesome.

27:09.758 --> 27:12.655
There's not a better feeling
Than going into a tribal,

27:12.689 --> 27:17.931
Knowing that you're 100% safe,
Especially when everything.

27:17.965 --> 27:21.655
Around you has told you lately
You are not safe.

27:21.689 --> 27:22.931
Good job, guys.

27:22.965 --> 27:25.034
So I get back to camp, and
I'm happy.

27:25.068 --> 27:28.620
But then I go in my bag, and
There is a parchment.

27:28.655 --> 27:32.689
And I'm pretty sure I don't have
A parchment.

27:32.724 --> 27:35.965
So I immediately sneak away.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.689
What is this?

27:38.724 --> 27:45.344
"When it is time to vote, use
This parchment to cast a second.

27:45.379 --> 27:45.689
Vote."

27:45.724 --> 27:46.551
Holy crap.

27:46.586 --> 27:50.034
I love you, joe, or aubry, or
Whoever.

27:50.068 --> 27:54.551
I went from feeling like not
Accepted, to then having the.

27:54.586 --> 27:59.137
Power of an extra vote to cast
At any time.

27:59.172 --> 28:00.379
It's amazing.

28:00.413 --> 28:03.965
But right now, I'm going to
Stick with the numbers, and hold.

28:04.000 --> 28:10.586
My tongue until it's time to
Make a move.

28:10.620 --> 28:12.310
We made it, kama.

28:12.344 --> 28:16.137
Kama strong, one, two, three.

28:16.172 --> 28:17.172
Kama strong!

28:17.206 --> 28:19.689
If we stay together, all of our
Loved ones come.

28:19.724 --> 28:21.320
What an amazing journey we
Started together.

28:21.344 --> 28:23.379
Loved one togethers.

28:25.241 --> 28:27.862
Erik and I are working
Together to control everybody.

28:27.896 --> 28:31.000
And we're using the loved one
Visit as a threat almost by.

28:31.034 --> 28:34.275
Saying, "Don't we all want to
Have our loved ones here?"

28:34.310 --> 28:36.896
By saying that it makes them not
Flip and try to have another.

28:36.931 --> 28:38.137
Alliance.

28:38.172 --> 28:39.344
It's genius.

28:39.379 --> 28:42.103
The only reason to not split
Is if we don't trust seven.

28:42.137 --> 28:44.310
People standing here right now.

28:44.344 --> 28:46.551
And that's why I think we should
Split.

28:46.586 --> 28:49.034
I think you go... you have to
Go after kelley first.

28:49.068 --> 28:53.000
If you're going to go after the
Girls, you have to go after.

28:53.034 --> 28:54.241
Kelley.

28:54.275 --> 28:55.527
I find the girls a threat
Overall, but lauren is much more.

28:55.551 --> 28:56.793
Physical.

28:56.827 --> 29:01.724
She's competing very well.

29:01.758 --> 29:05.931
I know this kama alliance
Won't last forever.

29:05.965 --> 29:09.344
Things are going to get crazy,
And when it does, myself and ron.

29:09.379 --> 29:12.413
Have david and devens in our
Pocket to make the big move.

29:12.448 --> 29:14.689
But it's not a worry for today.

29:14.724 --> 29:19.482
Let's use our nabs we so
Craftily acquired, and let's.

29:19.517 --> 29:22.965
Split some votes, and let's get
Some of those lesu players out,

29:23.000 --> 29:28.586
Starting with kelley.

29:28.620 --> 29:30.379
I feel like I'm going to cry.

29:30.413 --> 29:31.620
No, I know.

29:31.655 --> 29:36.413
It's like they're so happy to
Just pick us all off, and then.

29:36.448 --> 29:37.803
Have...
they're not looking at, like,

29:37.827 --> 29:38.620
The bigger picture.

29:38.655 --> 29:40.068
They're not.

29:40.103 --> 29:43.137
They just want to have a civil
War after we're all gone.

29:43.172 --> 29:44.000
That's what they want.

29:44.034 --> 29:46.034
Well, see you on extinction.

29:46.068 --> 29:48.344
That's about probably the
Size of it.

29:48.379 --> 29:51.655
The original kama people,
Along with rick devens, are all.

29:51.689 --> 29:54.379
This big voting bloc, like
They're going to vote probably.

29:54.413 --> 29:56.068
For myself or lauren tonight.

29:56.103 --> 29:58.034
And it's a scary thing.

29:58.068 --> 30:03.034
Luckily, lauren and I have
Idols.

30:03.068 --> 30:05.034
Yeah, exactly.

30:05.068 --> 30:08.275
When you have an idol, it's
Just about, like a gut feeling,

30:08.310 --> 30:11.586
And hoping that you are right.

30:11.620 --> 30:13.724
I know this is going to play
Out.

30:13.758 --> 30:16.689
It could be me going oracley
Going home, or lauren, but the.

30:16.724 --> 30:21.586
Seven of you kama, the final
Seven ain't going to be seven.

30:21.620 --> 30:23.862
We have to go out there and try
To find cracks.

30:23.896 --> 30:26.034
You can't say, "Ooms, I tried."

30:26.068 --> 30:27.137
It didn't work."

30:27.172 --> 30:28.896
You keep fighting in this game.

30:28.931 --> 30:30.700
Like I want to have open
Communication with you.

30:30.724 --> 30:31.241
Right.

30:31.275 --> 30:32.241
Sound fair, right.

30:32.275 --> 30:35.517
I love to leave the lines of
Communication open.

30:35.551 --> 30:36.724
Yeah.

30:36.758 --> 30:38.976
And I'm feeling like somebody
Is going to get eag or the.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.931
Seven, and you, david, and
Devens are the soldiers in their.

30:41.965 --> 30:43.206
Army.

30:43.241 --> 30:45.044
My best strategy is to convince
Those younger kama people that.

30:45.068 --> 30:46.586
They need soldiers for a war.

30:46.620 --> 30:49.896
Because once that war starts,
Who is david and devens siding.

30:49.931 --> 30:51.137
On?

30:51.172 --> 30:55.517
David
And devens, if that war goes.

30:55.551 --> 30:59.827
Down, and theatre two left, are
They siding with you or siding.

30:59.862 --> 31:06.586
With ron or erik.

31:06.620 --> 31:10.310
And they got those two guys off,
They win the game.

31:10.344 --> 31:12.827
When it's time, if you need a
Soldier, you have wardog here.

31:12.862 --> 31:13.482
Got you.

31:13.517 --> 31:15.206
You know what I'm saying?

31:15.241 --> 31:16.482
Dial him up.

31:16.517 --> 31:19.689
Wardog was breaking down his
Perception of the dynamics of.

31:19.724 --> 31:20.862
Kama.

31:20.896 --> 31:24.793
Saying that ron and erik are
Trying to pull in david and.

31:24.827 --> 31:29.551
Devens, and strcially make a
Move on gavin, victoria, and.

31:29.586 --> 31:30.241
Myself.

31:30.275 --> 31:31.424
And wardog might have a point.

31:31.448 --> 31:36.586
And I didn't realize it until he
Said it.

31:36.620 --> 31:38.379
What's going on, erik?

31:38.413 --> 31:39.586
Not much.

31:39.620 --> 31:43.137
I'm going to have to test
Erik by trying to push a david.

31:43.172 --> 31:47.103
Or devens vote, and that will be
The true testament who 2 who's.

31:47.137 --> 31:47.965
Working with who.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.241
Let me run something past you.

31:50.275 --> 31:54.931
Do you think it would be wise to
Maybe take out david before a

31:54.965 --> 31:55.965
Lauren or a kelley?

31:56.000 --> 31:58.241
You mean, like, right now?

31:58.275 --> 32:02.344
Yes.

32:02.379 --> 32:08.862
Um, I think... I think we can
Make it till eight.

32:08.896 --> 32:13.655
In the past he went to rocks.

32:13.689 --> 32:15.517
In his old season.

32:15.551 --> 32:17.827
So I think he has a good track
Record of loyalty.

32:17.862 --> 32:20.827
Wardog was right... they are
Going to try to use david and.

32:20.862 --> 32:24.034
Devens down the road to flip on
Us kama members.

32:24.068 --> 32:26.448
Just no one do anything Stupid.

32:26.482 --> 32:30.137
We're going to vote for family
Visit.

32:30.172 --> 32:32.034
It might be my time to make a
Big move.

32:32.068 --> 32:38.103
I feel like erik, ron, and
Jail, and me, you and vic.

32:38.137 --> 32:43.862
I feel like they're trying to
Bring in david and devens.

32:43.896 --> 32:48.689
It's me, you, and vic vote
With wardog...

32:48.724 --> 32:49.689
hold on.

32:49.724 --> 32:54.206
And kelley, we can take out
Whoever we want.

32:54.241 --> 32:57.620
What if, like, we do this
Vote, and take out erik, and.

32:57.655 --> 33:00.000
Then... >> why not ron?

33:01.517 --> 33:04.379
Eare, ic and ron saying,
"We've got to get to the family.

33:04.413 --> 33:04.965
Visit."

33:05.000 --> 33:07.137
It was like an epiphany.

33:07.172 --> 33:10.793
I have to win for my family, and
That's why I'm stepping my game.

33:10.827 --> 33:13.103
Up and coming in with guns
Blation.

33:13.137 --> 33:17.827
We're not going to win this game
If we don't make big moves like.

33:17.862 --> 33:18.758
This.

33:18.793 --> 33:20.286
I'm telling you, it's the best
Move for us.

33:20.310 --> 33:22.172
I'm in.

33:22.206 --> 33:27.206
What if
They're keeping david and devens.

33:27.241 --> 33:30.896
To flip on kama.

33:30.931 --> 33:35.448
If that's how you feel, then
We just make sure we get out

33:35.482 --> 33:36.310
David second.

33:36.344 --> 33:38.413
Vic's not down with the
Shenanigans.

33:38.448 --> 33:39.034
You're not.

33:39.068 --> 33:41.000
She said it's too soon.

33:41.034 --> 33:44.310
I just think you go one vote
Before you do any of this.

33:44.344 --> 33:46.241
I do.

33:46.275 --> 33:50.862
Every decision, every option
Carries some risk in this game.

33:50.896 --> 33:56.172
Tonight, we can stay kama
Strong, and it can be an easy.

33:56.206 --> 33:57.448
Vote taking out kelley.

33:57.482 --> 34:03.034
Or we can pull in the people at
The bottom, and we can make a.

34:03.068 --> 34:04.310
Big move now.

34:04.344 --> 34:07.206
And target ron or eric.

34:07.241 --> 34:11.551
They've taken advantage of the
Power that this alliance has.

34:11.585 --> 34:12.585
Gotten.

34:12.620 --> 34:14.827
But the bad part for them is
That we realize it.

34:14.862 --> 34:17.757
And they might be at the wrong
Side of the vote come tribal.

34:17.793 --> 34:20.068
Council.

34:33.068 --> 34:38.793
We'll now bring in.

34:38.827 --> 34:46.827
The members of our jury.

34:52.757 --> 34:56.172
Eric, one of the big
Topics at the last tribal was.

34:56.206 --> 34:57.275
The dominance of kama.

34:57.310 --> 35:00.758
One of the things that comes
With that is you have to.

35:00.793 --> 35:05.344
Navigate the relationships that
Can win or lose a game.

35:05.379 --> 35:09.689
Well, tonight, the kama seven
Had a beach-front roundtable,

35:09.724 --> 35:12.034
And we came up with a group
Decision.

35:12.068 --> 35:14.724
But that still leaves
Five people not in.

35:14.758 --> 35:17.034
How do you navigate those
Relationships?

35:17.068 --> 35:20.793
Well, I think these lesu
Members, they come in packages.

35:20.827 --> 35:24.310
And so, you navigate them
Carefully, of course.

35:24.344 --> 35:27.206
I like that terminology,
"Packages," because this package

35:27.241 --> 35:31.068
I'm part of wasn't given any
Kind of marching orders, so.

35:31.103 --> 35:34.137
Maybe the other package is more
In with the kama seven than I.

35:34.172 --> 35:35.310
Am.

35:35.344 --> 35:37.379
Devens, were you
Aware of the kama seven having.

35:37.413 --> 35:38.586
Their beach-side chat?

35:38.620 --> 35:41.344
Yes, they didn't try to keep
It a secret, and they know.

35:41.379 --> 35:42.586
Exactly where I stand.

35:42.620 --> 35:47.068
I was out of lesu's five as soon
As I was voted out of lesu's.

35:47.103 --> 35:48.137
Five.

35:48.172 --> 35:49.769
So the trust factor from lesu is
Pretty messed up.

35:49.793 --> 35:52.068
Okay, okay, devens, okay,
Whatever you say.

35:52.103 --> 35:53.000
I mean, straight up.

35:53.034 --> 35:55.379
I have no reason to lie.

35:55.413 --> 35:58.620
I'm already against you guys, so
I'm doing everything I can to.

35:58.655 --> 36:01.034
Get on the kama train.

36:01.068 --> 36:03.758
David, do you know
What devens is talk about.

36:03.793 --> 36:06.724
Devyns and I were spared last
Vote.

36:06.758 --> 36:07.931
They saved us.

36:07.965 --> 36:10.148
We are stay taij in the game
Where everyone up here has to.

36:10.172 --> 36:14.034
Decide soon whether or not they
Want to be a pilot or a.

36:14.068 --> 36:14.689
Passenger.

36:14.724 --> 36:16.586
And a pilot wins at the end.

36:16.620 --> 36:20.931
With the numbers being what they
Are, I am a passenger tonight.

36:20.965 --> 36:23.275
Eric, what does that Say to you?

36:23.310 --> 36:27.379
It's a message, right, it's a
Message to the kama seven that.

36:27.413 --> 36:30.310
Says, "Some of you may want to
Consider your position in the."

36:30.344 --> 36:31.586
Tribe."

36:31.620 --> 36:34.310
but, honestly, you have to
Avoid paranoia, and you have to.

36:34.344 --> 36:37.482
Stay strong, and the longer you
Can keep that alliance together.

36:37.517 --> 36:39.941
Where people trust each other,
The stronger you're going to be,

36:39.965 --> 36:41.206
And the longer you last.

36:41.241 --> 36:43.689
And I will say maybe it
Doesn't feel great to feel like.

36:43.724 --> 36:46.113
A passenger, but I know from
Talking to everyone up here how.

36:46.137 --> 36:49.310
Much we all want to see our
Loved ones.

36:49.344 --> 36:52.689
So why don't we stay focused
Here, get a couple of votes down.

36:52.724 --> 36:54.931
The road...
are we playing for a million.

36:54.965 --> 36:58.689
Dollars or just playing to get
To the loved ones visits.

36:58.724 --> 37:01.206
By then, the other lesu packages
Will be gone, and maybe you.

37:01.241 --> 37:02.413
Can't make a move then.

37:02.448 --> 37:07.620
It's crazy for me to be
Saying I'm agreeing with wardog.

37:07.655 --> 37:11.000
On a particular point here.

37:11.034 --> 37:13.827
Getting to the loved ones visit
Say benchmark and it's important.

37:13.862 --> 37:16.482
To everybody and you crave it.

37:16.517 --> 37:19.655
But if you aren't careful you'll
Find yourself on day 39 way.

37:19.689 --> 37:20.896
Blank resume.

37:20.931 --> 37:23.148
There are lots of blank sheets
Of paper sitting up here right.

37:23.172 --> 37:25.068
Now with maybe only their names
And addresses.

37:25.103 --> 37:30.586
And a lot of those addresses
Read, "44, 44, edge of."

37:30.620 --> 37:31.758
Extinction drive."

37:31.793 --> 37:34.275
Julia, is it to be
Amounted that at some point,

37:34.310 --> 37:36.931
Yes, we are going to make a
Move.

37:36.965 --> 37:37.862
We have to.

37:37.896 --> 37:39.320
There are only so many spots at
The final.

37:39.344 --> 37:41.551
I think it's on everyone's Mind.

37:41.586 --> 37:44.482
And whether or not there of
They're willing to make a move.

37:44.517 --> 37:49.034
Right now is where they're
Wavering.

37:49.068 --> 37:50.551
Victoria, are you in
Line with that?

37:50.586 --> 37:53.896
Is everybody thinking that on
Some level?

37:53.931 --> 37:56.758
It's just a matter of when do I
Make my move?

37:56.793 --> 38:00.448
Just because you're thinking
About it doesn't mean now with

38:00.482 --> 38:03.896
12 people still in the game is
When you make your move.

38:03.931 --> 38:06.344
Shoot your shot as long as
You're not shooting yourself in.

38:06.379 --> 38:07.068
The foot.

38:07.103 --> 38:08.689
I want to keep my feet tonight.

38:08.724 --> 38:12.034
Ron, what do you say
Tonight to make sure people.

38:12.068 --> 38:13.206
Don't make the move?

38:13.241 --> 38:16.034
For me, personally, I
Wouldn't want to go with all of.

38:16.068 --> 38:20.034
The lesu members right now,
Because I know they're put me on.

38:20.068 --> 38:21.137
The bottom.

38:21.172 --> 38:24.034
And, yet, are you
Fully open for business if.

38:24.068 --> 38:25.482
People want to join your
Alliance.

38:25.517 --> 38:26.586
Yes.

38:26.620 --> 38:28.631
We have limited spaces only for
A limited time only.

38:28.655 --> 38:31.793
There's no space for me,
Lauren, and wentworth.

38:31.827 --> 38:32.758
That's pretty clear.

38:32.793 --> 38:34.965
Aurora, what's your
Mood right now?

38:35.000 --> 38:38.034
Because you're wearing the
Immunity necklace, but until.

38:38.068 --> 38:41.379
Just that moment, you had had
Not the least bit of a smile.

38:41.413 --> 38:42.689
It was a scowl.

38:42.724 --> 38:46.655
I mean, there's a lot of talk
About how strong kama is and how.

38:46.689 --> 38:48.793
We really have taken control of
This game.

38:48.827 --> 38:51.862
But if you look, it's not that
We've taken control of the game.

38:51.896 --> 38:56.000
It's that everyone who's not in
This kama strong has literally.

38:56.034 --> 38:57.379
Fall tone pieces.

38:57.413 --> 39:00.482
Everyone has the chance to take
Control of this game.

39:00.517 --> 39:07.413
It's just who's going to
Actually decide to do it.

39:07.448 --> 39:09.034
All right, it is time To vote.

39:09.068 --> 39:12.310
Wentworth, you're up.

39:27.448 --> 39:30.655
Kelley, sometimes you're just
On the wrong side of the.

39:30.689 --> 39:31.172
Numbers.

39:31.206 --> 39:35.310
Tonight, that's you.

39:36.344 --> 39:43.551
I'll go tally the.

39:47.517 --> 39:51.862
Votes.

39:55.310 --> 39:57.689
If anybody has a
Hidden immunity idol and you.

39:57.724 --> 40:05.310
Want to play it, now would be
The time to do so.

40:05.344 --> 40:06.344
Okay.

40:06.379 --> 40:10.896
I'll read the votes.

40:11.137 --> 40:19.137
First vote, Wentworth.

40:19.448 --> 40:20.344
Lauren.

40:20.379 --> 40:20.931

40:20.965 --> 40:27.344
That's two votes lauren.

40:27.379 --> 40:28.000
Wentworth.

40:28.034 --> 40:33.758
That's two votes wentworth.

40:33.793 --> 40:39.172
Eric.

40:39.206 --> 40:40.413

40:40.448 --> 40:43.620
We're tied, two votes lauren,
Two votes wentworth, two votes

That's three votes eric, two
Votes lauren, two votes.

40:50.620 --> 40:55.724

40:55.758 --> 40:57.275

41:03.241 --> 41:03.793
Eric.

41:03.827 --> 41:08.758

Eighth person voted out and the
Fifth member of our jury, eric.

That's six.

41:12.758 --> 41:13.448
That's enough.

41:13.482 --> 41:14.862
You need to bring me your torch.

41:14.896 --> 41:16.517
Bravo!

Gets custody of our hidden.

Immunity idol.

42:25.689 --> 42:27.241
They're trying to bamboozle Us.

Somebody mounted something, so
Here I am on the edge of.

Extinction.

Have to be here, but I have a.

42:43.827 --> 42:49.068
