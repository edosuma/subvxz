02:40.425 --> 02:42.728
Stupid little midget.

02:47.767 --> 02:49.067
Ohh!

02:49.069 --> 02:50.569
You punk.

02:55.542 --> 02:57.209
What the hell
is wrong with you?

02:57.211 --> 02:58.544
Hey!

03:04.151 --> 03:05.851
Put on
something
clean.

03:05.853 --> 03:08.420
Visiting hours
are short enough as it is.

03:09.956 --> 03:11.123
Hurry!

03:11.125 --> 03:12.658
All right.

03:47.827 --> 03:48.927
Rey!

03:51.030 --> 03:52.364
Rey!

03:54.968 --> 03:56.935
All right.
I'm coming.

04:16.154 --> 04:17.889
Hey,
horse face!

04:18.992 --> 04:20.459
Hurry up!

04:23.096 --> 04:24.563
Hey, come here.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.568
Listen to me.

04:29.570 --> 04:30.869
If you're
gonna give me
shit this morning,

04:30.871 --> 04:32.271
I'll just
go right
back inside.

04:32.273 --> 04:33.705
Hear me?

04:45.852 --> 04:47.319
You done?

04:49.088 --> 04:50.355
Shit.

04:50.357 --> 04:52.357
Breakfast.

04:52.359 --> 04:54.026
Rey,
what are
you doing?

04:54.927 --> 04:56.261
Hold that.

04:56.263 --> 04:57.796
Damn it.
Where's the bread?

04:57.798 --> 04:58.830
I ate it.

04:58.832 --> 04:59.965
What? All of it?

04:59.967 --> 05:01.199
I just bought a whole
loaf two days ago.

05:01.201 --> 05:02.868
I was hungry.

05:04.037 --> 05:05.203
Unbelievable.

05:05.205 --> 05:06.371
Okay, well, you...

05:06.373 --> 05:07.539
You gotta eat
something, okay?

05:07.541 --> 05:09.041
If we don't
get there in time,

05:09.043 --> 05:10.509
you know
they're not gonna
let me see her,

05:10.511 --> 05:12.511
and she's waiting.

05:24.624 --> 05:26.358
Maybe you
should talk
to mom today.

05:27.493 --> 05:28.894
You know the drill.

05:28.896 --> 05:29.828
I'll take you there

05:29.830 --> 05:31.229
whenever you
want to see her,

05:31.231 --> 05:33.031
but I have
nothing to
say to her.

05:35.034 --> 05:37.836
But she has some things
she needs to say to you.

05:38.871 --> 05:40.639
It's important.

05:41.641 --> 05:42.774
What?

05:45.144 --> 05:46.778
Oliver, what is it?

05:46.780 --> 05:48.313
Maybe you should
pull over.

05:48.315 --> 05:50.749
No, I don't
need to pull over.
Just tell me.

05:53.886 --> 05:56.088
God damn it, Oliver!
Just spit it out!

05:56.090 --> 05:57.456
What?

05:57.458 --> 05:59.458
Mom's getting out.

06:12.472 --> 06:15.107
"And that's
when I knew

06:15.908 --> 06:16.975
"what...

06:17.443 --> 06:18.844
"How..."

06:22.548 --> 06:24.416
Come on. We worked
too hard on this.

06:24.418 --> 06:26.818
Come on. You can do it.

06:26.820 --> 06:30.822
"How I had done you wrong.

06:31.691 --> 06:34.159
"If I could eventfully...

06:34.161 --> 06:35.927
"If I...

06:36.796 --> 06:38.230
"If I could

06:38.232 --> 06:40.065
"eventually

06:40.067 --> 06:43.468
"tell you
I'm sorry,
i would, but

06:44.103 --> 06:46.738
"i can't anymore.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.708
"And I have to...
I have to
live with that."

06:53.746 --> 06:56.515
Thank you,
Angie.

06:58.050 --> 06:59.851
It's courageous...

07:00.787 --> 07:02.487
To admit
when we're
wrong.

07:07.527 --> 07:09.127
It's not a weakness.

07:16.869 --> 07:18.737
Lola, you
ready to read
your letter?

07:27.079 --> 07:28.880
You don't have it.

07:30.316 --> 07:32.184
You say
that you
love Oliver.

07:34.654 --> 07:36.521
Then prove it.

07:37.957 --> 07:40.025
What kind of example
are you gonna
set for him?

07:41.327 --> 07:43.028
That you face
your fears?

07:44.263 --> 07:45.831
Or that you
run away
from them?

07:48.367 --> 07:50.168
You ready to read?

08:29.308 --> 08:31.576
There you go.
Is that good?

08:33.479 --> 08:36.047
Yeah. Perfect.

09:13.219 --> 09:14.419
Hi, mom.

09:14.421 --> 09:15.587
Mmm, hi.

09:15.589 --> 09:17.956
Oli bear.

09:27.767 --> 09:28.867
Rey.

09:29.669 --> 09:32.604
I'm glad you came.

09:32.606 --> 09:34.706
Uh, I have
something to
tell you.

09:37.443 --> 09:38.810
What is it?

09:38.812 --> 09:41.012
I got
my beautician's
license.

09:42.214 --> 09:44.215
That's
really cool!

09:44.217 --> 09:45.617
And maybe when i
get out of here,

09:45.619 --> 09:47.152
I can give
you a haircut?

09:47.154 --> 09:48.620
Yeah. Be better
than a black eye.

09:48.622 --> 09:49.921
Rey!

09:52.058 --> 09:56.027
Yeah, will you, uh,
do me a favor, oli,

09:56.029 --> 09:58.964
and give me
and your brother
a minute alone?

10:02.401 --> 10:03.935
It's okay.

10:09.976 --> 10:11.810
When are they
releasing you?

10:14.513 --> 10:16.014
The 15th.

10:17.383 --> 10:18.984
You mean in two days?

10:21.387 --> 10:23.421
You've gotta
be kidding me.

10:23.423 --> 10:24.923
Maybe if you came
to visit me,

10:24.925 --> 10:26.591
you wouldn't have
been left in the dark.

10:26.593 --> 10:28.193
Okay, that's
a load of shit.

10:29.729 --> 10:32.664
You're free now.

10:32.666 --> 10:34.799
You don't gotta worry
about him anymore

10:35.468 --> 10:36.868
or me.

10:38.938 --> 10:40.338
Wh... what are
you thinking,

10:40.340 --> 10:42.073
that I'm just
gonna give
him to you?

10:43.009 --> 10:44.275
No.

10:44.277 --> 10:46.845
I'm taking him.

10:46.847 --> 10:49.414
Bo's helping
me set up
a place in town.

10:49.416 --> 10:50.849
He's my brother,

10:50.851 --> 10:52.250
and I'm the one
that raised him.

10:52.252 --> 10:54.052
I know.
I'm the one
that taught him.

10:54.054 --> 10:55.520
I know!

10:55.522 --> 10:57.355
I was the one that was
there for him
every single day

10:57.357 --> 10:59.658
when he came home
from school crying

10:59.660 --> 11:02.961
because kids kicked
the shit out of him.

11:02.963 --> 11:05.430
Him asking me
what a "junkie"

11:06.565 --> 11:08.333
and a "whore" was.

11:09.101 --> 11:10.902
After all that,

11:10.904 --> 11:12.837
you just want
to take him
away from me?

11:14.907 --> 11:16.841
I don't want
to fight you.

11:16.843 --> 11:19.077
Great. Don't.

11:20.246 --> 11:22.614
You're lucky
i don't tell him

11:22.616 --> 11:24.049
what you really are.

11:24.051 --> 11:25.150
Rey...

11:25.152 --> 11:26.451
How long
do you think
it'll take

11:26.453 --> 11:28.286
for you
to end up
back here?

11:28.288 --> 11:30.021
Huh?
Two years?

11:30.023 --> 11:31.089
One?

11:32.191 --> 11:33.625
Not even close.

11:33.627 --> 11:34.726
No, no, no.

11:34.728 --> 11:36.127
I'll give you a week.

11:36.129 --> 11:37.562
Enough!

11:37.564 --> 11:39.130
He's my son!

12:12.998 --> 12:15.166
What happened
in there?

12:40.493 --> 12:41.826
You bastard.

12:41.828 --> 12:43.027
You knew
and didn't
say anything.

12:44.597 --> 12:48.032
I reckon she
finally told you.
Yeah, why didn't you tell me?

12:48.034 --> 12:49.868
Instead of
letting me get
blindsided like that?

12:49.870 --> 12:51.469
What am i
supposed to do?

12:51.471 --> 12:52.804
You know
i don't like getting
in the middle of it.

12:52.806 --> 12:55.039
But you are
in the middle.

12:55.041 --> 12:57.776
Look, I care for
you boys like
you're my own.

12:57.778 --> 12:59.811
Okay? But these things,
your mother...

12:59.813 --> 13:01.112
I mean,
god damn it
all to hell...

13:01.114 --> 13:03.114
Why do you
keep protecting her

13:03.116 --> 13:05.884
after everything
she's done to you,
to us?

13:06.152 --> 13:07.919
Huh?

13:07.921 --> 13:09.220
We've been
better parents to Oliver

13:09.222 --> 13:12.056
than she ever was
or ever will be.

13:14.093 --> 13:16.227
I'm not gonna
let her take him
from me.

13:16.695 --> 13:18.163
I'm not.

13:34.847 --> 13:36.214
Shit.

14:05.477 --> 14:06.978
Michelle?

14:07.746 --> 14:08.813
Rey?

14:10.350 --> 14:12.483
Oh, my god!

14:12.485 --> 14:13.551
Hi.

14:15.187 --> 14:17.455
I, uh,
thought that
was you.

14:17.890 --> 14:19.157
Yeah.

14:20.492 --> 14:22.193
Um, how's,
how's Stanford?

14:22.195 --> 14:26.698
Oh, I graduated, like,
a couple years ago.

14:26.700 --> 14:27.899
Oh. You did?

14:27.901 --> 14:29.334
Yeah.
Oh.

14:31.705 --> 14:34.405
Uh, hey, but
have you heard of
beat street sf?

14:35.507 --> 14:36.941
Uh, no.

14:37.309 --> 14:38.710
Well,

14:38.712 --> 14:41.112
you're looking at
their social media
strategist.

14:42.648 --> 14:44.048
Oh.

14:45.317 --> 14:47.785
Like, I'm
in charge of the
brand development.

14:47.787 --> 14:50.088
Okay, yeah.
Got it.

14:50.090 --> 14:51.789
Yeah.

14:51.791 --> 14:54.325
Actually,
i have a card.

14:54.327 --> 14:56.561
I have my own
extension
and everything.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.229
Oh, jeez, wow.

14:58.764 --> 15:00.164
That's cool.

15:00.166 --> 15:01.599
Are you
in San Francisco?

15:02.935 --> 15:04.702
Yeah, mmm-hmm.

15:04.704 --> 15:07.071
That's...
That's awesome.

15:07.073 --> 15:09.340
Happy for you.

15:09.342 --> 15:11.976
You know,
i, I wanted
to reach out

15:11.978 --> 15:13.211
or call you or,

15:13.213 --> 15:14.612
I don't know,
write.

15:14.614 --> 15:16.614
It was
a long time ago.

15:17.616 --> 15:19.617
Yeah. Yeah.

15:22.988 --> 15:25.123
Uh, hey,
how's Oliver?

15:25.125 --> 15:26.925
He's good.
No, he's
really good.

15:26.927 --> 15:28.259
He's gotten
really big.

15:28.261 --> 15:29.627
Really?
You should
come see him.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.195
You probably wouldn't
even recognize him.

15:33.198 --> 15:34.666
You know, you, um,

15:34.668 --> 15:36.868
you should bring him
by Dave's joint tonight.

15:36.870 --> 15:38.236
My whole family's
gonna be there.

15:38.238 --> 15:39.837
I'm sure they'd
like to see you.

15:39.839 --> 15:41.172
Pretty sure
your dad could go
without seeing me

15:41.174 --> 15:42.240
for the rest
of his life.

15:42.242 --> 15:45.176
Yeah.

15:45.178 --> 15:47.278
Well, uh,
he won't
be there, so...

15:48.247 --> 15:49.347
Oh.

15:50.282 --> 15:52.517
Rey, my dad
passed away.

15:53.485 --> 15:55.720
It was the cancer...

15:55.722 --> 15:57.221
Finally got him.

15:57.223 --> 15:58.656
That's...That's why
I'm here, you know.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.658
We're having
his memorial
service, so...

16:03.095 --> 16:04.729
I'm so sorry.

16:05.531 --> 16:07.131
Uh...

16:07.133 --> 16:08.166
Anyway, you,
you should come.

16:12.004 --> 16:13.571
Hey, but if you
can't make it, don't...

16:13.573 --> 16:15.406
Don't even worry.
I know this
is last minute.

16:15.408 --> 16:17.608
No. No, I'll...
I'll be there.

16:18.844 --> 16:20.178
Okay.

16:26.385 --> 16:27.719
- Let's go, Gil!
- Do it again!

16:29.889 --> 16:31.155
Come on.
Just get one more!

16:31.157 --> 16:32.890
Come on, Gil.

16:32.892 --> 16:34.425
Crush it!
Come on, Gil.

16:37.163 --> 16:38.396
Ball!

16:38.398 --> 16:39.764
Come on,
Oliver!
Let's go!

16:39.766 --> 16:41.699
Protect the plate.

16:41.701 --> 16:42.767
You got it.

16:46.739 --> 16:48.740
Ball! Two strikes!

16:48.742 --> 16:50.108
Fastball right over
the plate, buddy.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.709
You got it!

17:01.420 --> 17:03.588
- Strike three!
- Batter's out!

17:23.142 --> 17:24.608
This music is lame.

17:25.810 --> 17:27.578
I'm hungry.

17:27.579 --> 17:28.880
Okay.

17:28.882 --> 17:29.981
Just one more song.

17:29.983 --> 17:31.616
Damn it, Rey!

18:58.137 --> 18:59.570
Lights out!

19:06.612 --> 19:08.579
Well, look what
the cat drug in.

19:10.048 --> 19:11.482
Hello, Dave.

19:14.653 --> 19:15.753
Hey.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.457
Want some help?

19:19.459 --> 19:21.626
Uh, nope.
I got it.
Thank you.

19:23.262 --> 19:25.329
Hey, sis,
you okay?

19:25.331 --> 19:26.831
Uh, yeah,
I'm good.
Thanks, Dave.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.266
All right.

19:28.268 --> 19:30.134
I'm gonna
have a smoke
if you need me.

19:30.136 --> 19:31.536
Thanks.

19:31.538 --> 19:32.803
You know,
you've gotten better.

19:32.805 --> 19:34.605
What?

19:34.607 --> 19:36.274
The song
you played
tonight,

19:36.975 --> 19:38.843
it was
really good.

19:40.212 --> 19:42.113
You heard it?

19:42.115 --> 19:43.481
Yeah.

19:44.082 --> 19:45.316
I was outside.

19:45.318 --> 19:46.617
Oliver was giving me
a hard time,

19:46.619 --> 19:49.487
so we stayed
out there,

19:49.489 --> 19:51.522
but, yeah,
i saw you play.

19:55.694 --> 19:56.594
Okay. All right.

19:56.596 --> 19:59.230
So, uh,
what song
did I sing?

20:05.704 --> 20:07.305
Um...

20:07.307 --> 20:09.440
It went a, a little
something like this.

20:14.414 --> 20:15.913
Is this tuned?
Yeah.

20:15.915 --> 20:18.115
Okay, cool.
All right.

20:28.093 --> 20:29.627
Okay. All right.
Thank you.

20:29.629 --> 20:30.962
I believe you.
You were here.

20:36.035 --> 20:37.535
Oh, my gosh. Stop!

20:37.537 --> 20:39.237
Okay.
Thank you. Thank you.

20:39.239 --> 20:40.938
Stop. Thank you.
I believe it.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.406
All right
I'll tell
you what.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.575
I'll stop
if you
sing for me.

20:45.611 --> 20:46.978
No.

20:46.980 --> 20:48.145
No?

20:48.147 --> 20:50.615
No.
Okay.

20:55.088 --> 20:56.220
Fine, fine.

20:56.222 --> 20:57.288
You want
to hear it?

20:57.290 --> 20:58.356
Okay. Okay.
All right.

20:58.358 --> 20:59.557
All right, get ready.

20:59.559 --> 21:01.292
Mmm-hmm.
Front row.

21:01.294 --> 21:02.627
Good.

21:02.629 --> 21:03.761
Okay.

22:35.387 --> 22:37.355
That was the one.

22:40.126 --> 22:42.393
Why don't
we go out
to our spot...

22:42.928 --> 22:44.628
Like old times?

22:47.065 --> 22:48.599
I don't know.
I, um...

22:48.601 --> 22:50.768
I have to
get up early
for a flight.

22:53.438 --> 22:55.406
Well, I gotta be up
in, like, five hours

22:55.408 --> 22:57.808
to take Oliver
to school. So?

23:01.179 --> 23:02.947
I tell you what.

23:04.182 --> 23:06.684
Why don't
we drink one down
for your dad?

23:14.860 --> 23:15.860
Those look
like a seahorse.

23:19.598 --> 23:21.565
My dad
used to tell me
all the names

23:21.567 --> 23:23.667
of the constellations
when I was little.

23:24.603 --> 23:26.170
God, he hated it

23:26.172 --> 23:27.371
when we would
sneak off together.

23:29.442 --> 23:31.709
Yes, he would.

23:39.484 --> 23:41.719
Well, you were lucky.

23:41.721 --> 23:44.121
Why? That my
dad hated you?

23:44.123 --> 23:45.890
That you got
all that time
with him.

23:46.825 --> 23:48.392
The only thing
i knew about mine

23:48.394 --> 23:51.996
was when I would
do something
to piss Lola off,

23:51.998 --> 23:55.499
she'd go on
and on about
how I was just like him...

23:56.868 --> 23:59.003
The way I look,
the way I talk...

24:00.672 --> 24:02.506
Way I furrow
my brow.

24:03.608 --> 24:05.142
What, like this?

24:07.746 --> 24:08.879
Well, I always thought

24:08.881 --> 24:11.649
that was the cutest
thing about you.

24:11.651 --> 24:13.150
Well, she
didn't think so.

24:15.387 --> 24:16.921
Anyways...

24:23.228 --> 24:24.862
To dead dads.

24:27.400 --> 24:28.732
Okay.

24:31.102 --> 24:32.903
To the good ones.

24:36.241 --> 24:37.508
Yeah.

24:37.510 --> 24:40.778
And to the screw-ups.

24:46.151 --> 24:48.486
I don't want you to
take this the wrong way,

24:48.488 --> 24:52.189
but, um,
seeing you earlier
at the gas station...

24:53.658 --> 24:55.125
You know,
it made me sad.

25:00.499 --> 25:02.600
Well, I got Oliver.

25:04.269 --> 25:06.003
And he needs me.

25:11.676 --> 25:14.478
I know.
I've always
loved that about you.

25:14.480 --> 25:18.816
What? That I gave up
my life for
someone else?

25:18.818 --> 25:21.685
No, that you
loved him enough

25:21.687 --> 25:24.021
to give him a life
that you couldn't have.

25:31.963 --> 25:33.964
If you could find
a way to leave...

25:35.600 --> 25:37.568
I could help you
get on your feet.

25:49.347 --> 25:51.315
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

25:51.317 --> 25:52.416
No.

25:52.418 --> 25:53.851
No, I'm sorry.

25:56.222 --> 25:57.855
I just, uh...

26:01.993 --> 26:03.127
No...

26:04.696 --> 26:06.230
It's okay.

28:03.748 --> 28:05.249
Michelle.

28:09.320 --> 28:10.454
Hey, what time is it?

28:15.560 --> 28:17.094
Oh, shit.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.154
Oliver?

28:53.498 --> 28:54.898
Oliver?

29:00.338 --> 29:01.405
Oliver!

29:14.853 --> 29:16.286
Oliver?

29:24.229 --> 29:25.863
He showed up at
3:00 in the morning

29:25.865 --> 29:27.331
mumbling that you'd
left him for good.

29:27.333 --> 29:29.733
This isn't right, Rey!
He's still a kid!

29:29.735 --> 29:30.901
I know.
I know, okay?

29:30.903 --> 29:32.436
Listen, it's...
Look, look, look.

29:32.438 --> 29:34.338
I've been thinking
about you a lot,
all right?

29:34.340 --> 29:36.340
And what you
said to me
the other day.

29:36.342 --> 29:38.742
I can't even
imagine what all this
has done to you.

29:38.744 --> 29:41.378
It wasn't right.
It still isn't.

29:41.380 --> 29:44.848
It's just... I mean,
she's supposedly
turned things around.

29:44.850 --> 29:47.484
I'm sorry.
I guess everyone
deserves a second chance.

29:47.486 --> 29:49.353
Well,
what about me?

29:49.355 --> 29:51.288
Huh? I never even had
a first chance.

29:52.190 --> 29:54.324
I gotta support
my wife.

29:54.326 --> 29:56.126
My hands are tied.

31:03.094 --> 31:05.329
<i> Hi. This is Michelle Turner
 at beat street sf.</i>

31:05.331 --> 31:07.364
<i> I'm not at my desk
 at the moment.</i>

31:07.366 --> 31:09.366
<i> Please leave a message
 and I'll call you back.</i>

31:11.636 --> 31:13.337
Hey.

31:13.339 --> 31:14.905
Hey, I've uh...

31:14.907 --> 31:16.773
I've thought about
what you said.

31:16.775 --> 31:18.275
I'm gonna go for it.

31:18.910 --> 31:21.044
I'm gonna do it.

31:21.046 --> 31:23.280
Anyways...
Give me a call back.

31:23.282 --> 31:24.348
I gotta go.

31:24.916 --> 31:27.351
Bye.

31:27.353 --> 31:29.653
<i> So,
 mom said she wants
 some time alone?</i>

31:29.655 --> 31:31.221
<i> Yup.</i>

31:31.223 --> 31:33.190
So she can get
ready for us.

31:34.392 --> 31:35.626
"For us"?

31:35.628 --> 31:38.295
Yeah. We're all
gonna be together again.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.172
Really?

31:50.608 --> 31:52.209
Like a real family?

31:55.480 --> 31:57.948
Oliver, we are
a real family.

32:00.485 --> 32:02.486
So where are we
driving to?

32:08.092 --> 32:09.826
It says "Santa Cruz."

32:09.828 --> 32:11.929
Exactly.

32:11.931 --> 32:14.498
You know i
don't like the beach.

32:14.500 --> 32:17.601
How would you know?
Neither of us
has ever been.

32:17.603 --> 32:19.436
I'm scared of the water,
you know that.

32:19.438 --> 32:21.405
Okay, well, you're
gonna get there

32:21.407 --> 32:22.739
and you're gonna
get in the water
and you're gonna love it.

32:22.741 --> 32:24.107
All right?
Trust me.
Yeah.

32:24.109 --> 32:25.976
Well, I'm not
getting in the water, so...

32:25.978 --> 32:27.344
Okay, fine.
Don't get in the water.

32:27.346 --> 32:30.147
But doesn't it
look amazing?
Yeah.

32:30.149 --> 32:33.317
Well... does mom
know where we're going?

32:33.319 --> 32:34.985
Yes.

32:34.987 --> 32:36.353
When are we
coming back?

32:36.355 --> 32:38.288
I don't know, okay?
Soon.

32:38.290 --> 32:39.957
We'll... we'll figure
it out.

32:39.959 --> 32:42.492
Just sit back, relax
and enjoy the
goddamn vacation.

32:42.494 --> 32:45.295
Yeah, well, I have
a goddamn science test
Thursday.

32:46.130 --> 32:48.532
Hey, don't be a dick.

32:48.534 --> 32:50.434
All right?
It's gonna be fun,
all right?

32:51.269 --> 32:52.336
All right?

32:53.304 --> 32:54.371
Okay?

32:56.774 --> 32:58.642
Mmm-hmm.
All right.

32:58.644 --> 33:01.511
You know, officially,
this is a kidnapping.

33:35.047 --> 33:36.747
2,000 route
through the 50?

33:45.257 --> 33:47.591
Rey!
Yeah, I heard it.

33:52.931 --> 33:54.031
Oh.

33:54.033 --> 33:55.966
What's that?

33:55.968 --> 33:58.168
Why are we
taking this road?

33:58.170 --> 34:00.370
What do you mean?
It's longer.

34:00.805 --> 34:02.072
Hey.

34:04.242 --> 34:06.543
You rat dropping!
Why'd you do that?

34:06.545 --> 34:07.911
I can't see.

35:00.998 --> 35:03.133
Is that mom?

35:03.135 --> 35:05.635
Can I talk to her?
Uh, no it's not mom.

35:07.505 --> 35:09.139
Well, is it Bo?

35:09.774 --> 35:10.841
No.

35:14.513 --> 35:16.546
Rey, it's Bo.
Where the hell are you,
man? Call me.

35:18.483 --> 35:19.549
Give me that.

35:26.090 --> 35:27.357
Here you go.

35:29.894 --> 35:31.761
Big day tomorrow.
Yeah?

35:35.299 --> 35:36.566
To the beach.

35:37.268 --> 35:39.035
Can we go to las Vegas?

35:39.037 --> 35:41.037
Las Vegas? Why?

35:41.039 --> 35:42.706
What do you think,
dude?

35:42.708 --> 35:44.374
See strippers.

35:44.376 --> 35:46.710
See strippers?

35:46.712 --> 35:47.944
Why not?

35:47.946 --> 35:50.647
'Cause you are
far too young
for that.

35:50.649 --> 35:53.250
Didn't know
there was an age limit.

35:53.252 --> 35:54.518
Well, there is.

36:14.705 --> 36:15.772
Rey!

36:37.929 --> 36:39.196
Oh, Rey.

36:40.932 --> 36:42.199
Oh, jeez.

39:16.587 --> 39:19.022
And Oliver hightower
steps up to the plate.

39:21.025 --> 39:22.392
Bases loaded.

39:22.394 --> 39:24.427
Full count.
Two outs.

39:26.330 --> 39:28.131
Bottom of the ninth.

39:34.672 --> 39:36.373
You asshole!
Strike three!

39:36.375 --> 39:39.242
Batter's out.
You know I hate
inside pitches.

39:39.244 --> 39:41.611
Pitchers are gonna
throw the ball inside,
okay?

39:41.613 --> 39:43.680
Especially if they know
you don't like it.

39:43.682 --> 39:46.116
Come on,
don't back down.
Step up!

39:46.118 --> 39:47.917
What do I always say?
Protect the plate.

39:47.919 --> 39:49.219
Huh?

39:49.221 --> 39:51.421
Come on.
No, listen to me.

39:51.423 --> 39:54.124
What do you do
if somebody tries
to take something from you?

39:54.126 --> 39:56.292
Or they try and
push you around.
Huh?

39:56.294 --> 39:57.961
What do you do?
Protect the plate.

39:57.963 --> 39:59.429
I'm sorry.
I couldn't hear you.

39:59.431 --> 40:01.865
Protect the
goddamn plate!

40:01.867 --> 40:03.433
Thank you!

40:23.588 --> 40:25.755
Son of a bitch!

40:26.157 --> 40:27.557
That's it!

40:27.559 --> 40:29.659
You stood strong,
you protected the plate.

40:30.294 --> 40:31.795
You weren't afraid.

40:35.199 --> 40:36.466
You okay?

40:37.401 --> 40:38.868
Shut your hole
and pitch.

40:41.639 --> 40:43.072
All right.
You sure?

40:44.375 --> 40:45.642
Pitch, bitch!

40:46.477 --> 40:47.744
Let's go, punk.

41:00.057 --> 41:01.624
Whoo!

41:02.226 --> 41:03.493
Take that!

41:15.906 --> 41:19.075
Really glad that
we're all gonna be
a family again.

42:00.484 --> 42:03.119
I don't know,
maybe we should
call the police.

42:03.121 --> 42:04.554
No.

42:06.023 --> 42:07.624
No police.

42:23.807 --> 42:26.976
Rey's been pulling
these pictures out of
my magazines for years.

42:28.379 --> 42:30.513
He likes fishing?

42:30.515 --> 42:32.181
Yeah, which is funny,
'cause he's never been.

42:32.183 --> 42:35.251
I mean, he's never
so much as picked up a rod.

42:35.253 --> 42:37.253
But he sure likes
dreaming about it.

42:40.391 --> 42:42.725
But they're
just dreams.

42:46.463 --> 42:49.165
<i> When he was small...</i>

42:49.167 --> 42:51.668
<i> We used to imagine
 we'd go there together.</i>

42:57.942 --> 43:00.543
<i> I used to make
 the sound of the ocean</i>

43:00.545 --> 43:02.645
<i> just to help him
 fall asleep.</i>

43:36.080 --> 43:37.981
That's where
they're headed.

43:39.049 --> 43:40.116
What?

43:41.552 --> 43:43.386
They're going to
Santa Cruz.

43:43.388 --> 43:44.654
How do you know?

43:45.055 --> 43:46.122
Look.

43:47.091 --> 43:49.058
They could be anywhere...

43:53.297 --> 43:54.797
I know my son.

44:14.284 --> 44:18.287
Guess I'd probably
buy a plane ticket.

44:18.289 --> 44:19.989
Go to Malaysia.

44:21.258 --> 44:22.692
Where's that?

44:22.694 --> 44:24.694
It's in Asia.

44:32.870 --> 44:34.604
Why don't you
pick up the phone?

44:34.606 --> 44:36.305
Because I don't want to.
But why?

44:37.641 --> 44:40.143
What if he's calling
about mom?

44:40.145 --> 44:42.145
He's not calling
about mom.

44:43.113 --> 44:44.180
Trust me.

44:45.182 --> 44:46.416
He hates mom.

44:53.624 --> 44:55.425
Why do you guys
hate her so much?

45:19.416 --> 45:20.483
Oliver?

45:23.020 --> 45:24.387
Oliver!

45:31.161 --> 45:32.428
Oliver!

45:40.104 --> 45:41.304
Hey.

45:41.306 --> 45:43.139
What are you doing
out here?

45:51.348 --> 45:52.181
I miss mom.

45:55.419 --> 45:56.486
I miss Bo.

45:59.990 --> 46:01.324
Is that my phone?

46:06.663 --> 46:07.930
What did you do?

46:09.266 --> 46:10.466
Did you call her?

46:12.936 --> 46:14.504
I don't know
your password.

46:18.408 --> 46:19.475
It's 0-5-2-2.

46:22.980 --> 46:25.181
It's 0-5-2-2.

46:25.183 --> 46:26.783
Go ahead.

46:26.785 --> 46:28.351
Call him if
you want to.

46:30.554 --> 46:32.255
I can call them?

46:32.257 --> 46:33.523
Yeah, of course
you can.

46:35.092 --> 46:37.193
But what sucks is
that you don't trust me.

46:37.895 --> 46:39.162
I do trust you.

46:40.798 --> 46:43.099
Really?

46:43.101 --> 46:45.268
Well, then why
did you come
all the way out here

46:45.270 --> 46:46.836
in the middle of
the night

46:46.838 --> 46:49.038
and steal my phone
to try and call them?

46:50.073 --> 46:51.974
Hmm?

46:51.976 --> 46:54.277
I don't know what
you're waiting for.

46:54.279 --> 46:57.113
Call them.
See what they
have to say.

46:57.115 --> 46:58.815
It's clear you think
I'm some sort
of liar.

46:58.817 --> 47:00.283
I know you're
not a liar.

47:11.795 --> 47:13.429
After we get
to the beach,

47:15.199 --> 47:16.265
go back.

47:18.068 --> 47:20.403
And you'll
talk to her.

47:20.405 --> 47:22.905
But we'll talk to her
together.

47:25.876 --> 47:27.276
As a family.

47:32.082 --> 47:33.149
Okay?

47:34.751 --> 47:36.052
Promise me.

47:36.954 --> 47:38.221
Please.

47:41.758 --> 47:43.025
Okay.

47:44.061 --> 47:45.328
Okay.

49:06.844 --> 49:07.877
Stop it.

49:09.080 --> 49:10.212
Be civilized.

49:10.214 --> 49:11.447
Chew, swallow,
then talk.

49:13.117 --> 49:14.216
Are you serious?

49:14.218 --> 49:16.218
That's disgusting.

49:16.220 --> 49:18.554
At least it's not
coming out the other end.

49:18.956 --> 49:20.256
Yeah.

49:34.471 --> 49:36.472
Oh, my god, dude!

49:37.808 --> 49:39.208
Oh, my god!

49:39.210 --> 49:41.277
You... oh, you suck!

49:41.279 --> 49:42.812
Come on!

49:49.953 --> 49:52.421
Oh, god!

50:53.417 --> 50:54.617
Shit.

50:55.252 --> 50:56.552
What's wrong with it?

50:57.554 --> 50:58.687
I don't know.

51:02.192 --> 51:03.659
So what do we do now?

51:16.473 --> 51:18.841
Come on.
Let's go find some help.

51:33.123 --> 51:35.357
Man,
it's worse than I thought.

51:35.359 --> 51:38.194
Hey, it's a good thing
i picked you up, bro.

51:38.196 --> 51:40.129
How much will it cost
to fix all that?

51:40.131 --> 51:41.163
$3,000.

51:41.165 --> 51:43.199
3,000? Back home,

51:43.201 --> 51:44.667
I work in a gas station,
all right,

51:44.669 --> 51:45.935
so I know a thing or two
about cars...

51:45.937 --> 51:47.303
I mean, the car's dead,
brother.

51:47.305 --> 51:48.537
I don't know what
to tell you, all right?

51:48.539 --> 51:50.339
I don't have
that kind of money.

51:50.341 --> 51:51.707
I'll help you out, okay?

51:51.709 --> 51:53.142
I'll buy it off of you.

51:54.744 --> 51:56.378
How much?

51:56.380 --> 51:58.280
I'll give you
100 for it.

51:58.282 --> 52:01.617
I mean, hell, you're gonna
have to junk it anyway.

52:05.288 --> 52:07.223
100?

52:08.492 --> 52:10.192
What was I supposed to do?

52:11.962 --> 52:13.395
How are we
gonna get home?

52:13.397 --> 52:16.132
I don't have
the money to fix it.

52:16.134 --> 52:17.967
Do you have
3,000 bucks on you?

52:17.969 --> 52:19.502
No, I didn't think so.

52:20.270 --> 52:22.404
100 ducats, brother!

52:22.406 --> 52:24.006
Hey!

52:24.008 --> 52:25.508
We're not selling.

52:25.510 --> 52:28.144
Not for 100.
Want the car?

52:29.045 --> 52:30.179
The price is 500.

52:31.449 --> 52:32.982
Well, what's he
talking about? Here.

52:32.984 --> 52:35.284
100, as we agreed.

52:35.286 --> 52:36.919
You know,
it's actually his car.

52:38.455 --> 52:40.456
What? He's, like,
eight years old.

52:40.458 --> 52:41.891
I'm 10.
He's 10.

52:41.893 --> 52:44.593
Whatever, man.
10-year-olds don't own cars.

52:44.595 --> 52:48.097
Look, our mom
left it to him

52:48.099 --> 52:49.398
when she died...

52:50.700 --> 52:51.767
Last week.

52:55.005 --> 52:57.640
Yeah, but you and I,
we already made a deal.

52:57.642 --> 52:59.441
I know, okay?

52:59.443 --> 53:03.012
But that car, that's all
that's left of her.

53:03.014 --> 53:04.346
That's all he's got.

53:09.119 --> 53:13.355
She used to take me
on road trips...
Like this one.

53:13.357 --> 53:15.658
Yeah? What'd she die of?

53:19.196 --> 53:20.596
She killed herself.

53:21.831 --> 53:23.632
That's why we were
headed to the ocean,

53:24.834 --> 53:26.769
to spread her ashes there.

53:26.771 --> 53:30.372
You know, I, I lost
my mother early, too, kid.

53:30.374 --> 53:33.075
All right, everything is
gonna be all right.

53:33.077 --> 53:35.110
So how about 300?
500.

53:35.112 --> 53:36.512
350.
500.

53:36.514 --> 53:38.280
Okay, this is
my final offer,

53:38.282 --> 53:39.648
and I am
being nice, kid,

53:39.650 --> 53:41.350
because of your mother
and all.

53:42.118 --> 53:43.519
400.

53:43.521 --> 53:44.853
My mother
would have told me

53:44.855 --> 53:46.655
only to accept 500,

53:46.657 --> 53:48.557
and I keep the tie
for the funeral.

53:55.665 --> 53:56.832
Little shit.

53:58.969 --> 54:02.905
One, two, three, four.

54:03.640 --> 54:04.673
That's 500.

54:04.675 --> 54:07.409
Take it before i
change my mind.

54:42.345 --> 54:44.580
Bo...

54:44.582 --> 54:47.049
There's enough room
in here for both of us.

55:09.039 --> 55:11.373
Bo.
What?

55:12.242 --> 55:13.742
Take off your boots.

56:01.658 --> 56:03.525
Don't.
What's wrong?

56:03.527 --> 56:05.627
Just don't do that.
Don't do what?

56:05.629 --> 56:07.896
I'm just gonna sleep
on the floor, okay?

56:55.645 --> 56:57.112
I gotta pull over.

57:20.103 --> 57:22.971
Bo, Bo, we're so close.

57:22.973 --> 57:24.840
And what are we gonna do
if we find them?

57:24.842 --> 57:27.743
I mean, you just gonna
take Oliver from Rey?

57:27.745 --> 57:29.478
Over and over,
those boys ain't had

57:29.480 --> 57:31.447
nothin'
but disappointment

57:31.449 --> 57:32.815
and heartbreak.

57:34.984 --> 57:36.785
But you know
what kept them going?

57:37.754 --> 57:39.488
They always
had each other.

57:40.457 --> 57:41.957
Now you want
to take that, too.

57:43.359 --> 57:44.860
You want
to take that away.

58:04.647 --> 58:08.684
I found this
hidden on your desk.

58:14.891 --> 58:16.458
You only put it on
when you came

58:16.460 --> 58:18.494
to see me, didn't you?

58:28.404 --> 58:29.805
You don't know
how hard it was

58:29.807 --> 58:31.640
to me to keep
putting this thing on.

58:34.377 --> 58:35.711
I mean, there are times

58:35.713 --> 58:38.280
I just wanted
to Chuck it, you know,

58:38.282 --> 58:41.116
just throw it all away
after what you did.

58:42.485 --> 58:44.953
I'd think about leaving,
you know.

58:44.955 --> 58:48.123
You'd be waiting for me
to visit.

58:48.125 --> 58:50.692
One day, I just wouldn't
be there. I'd be gone.

59:13.917 --> 59:16.618
When I was in prison,
i felt so alone.

59:22.725 --> 59:23.926
Especially when I realized

59:23.928 --> 59:25.961
how much pain
i had caused you.

59:32.569 --> 59:35.003
Sometimes I wanted
to kill myself for it.

59:39.576 --> 59:42.010
You used to talk
about a garden.

59:44.080 --> 59:47.916
You told me
you wanted to plant

59:47.918 --> 59:51.086
a huge garden
in the desert.

59:53.289 --> 59:54.590
An oasis.

59:56.492 --> 59:58.527
You wanted
to create life there.

01:00:08.371 --> 01:00:11.239
Yeah, plant fruit trees
and grow vegetables.

01:00:12.275 --> 01:00:13.909
Yes.

01:00:16.512 --> 01:00:18.480
And for six years,

01:00:18.482 --> 01:00:19.881
I lead myself
to believe

01:00:19.883 --> 01:00:21.350
that when I got out,

01:00:22.652 --> 01:00:25.220
that we could create
that life together...

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:28.724
A good one.

01:00:30.526 --> 01:00:33.195
You, me, Oliver.

01:00:34.697 --> 01:00:36.098
What about Rey?

01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:38.066
I mean, you ever
think about him?

01:00:41.571 --> 01:00:42.838
Man...

01:01:16.373 --> 01:01:18.440
<i> We're here
 to see Michelle Turner.</i>

01:01:18.442 --> 01:01:19.741
Have a seat, please.

01:02:42.492 --> 01:02:43.692
Hi.

01:02:43.694 --> 01:02:44.793
Yes?

01:02:44.795 --> 01:02:46.561
Yes, is, is
Michelle here?

01:02:46.563 --> 01:02:47.896
Uh, she is here.

01:02:47.898 --> 01:02:49.064
She's just really busy,

01:02:49.066 --> 01:02:50.132
in and out
of meetings all day.

01:02:50.134 --> 01:02:51.833
Okay. Well, did you
let her know

01:02:51.835 --> 01:02:53.301
that we're
here waiting?

01:02:53.303 --> 01:02:55.971
Sir, she'll be out
to meet you when she's ready.

01:02:57.206 --> 01:02:58.306
Okay.

01:02:59.475 --> 01:03:00.642
Hey, grab your stuff.

01:03:00.644 --> 01:03:01.943
Come on.

01:03:02.812 --> 01:03:03.945
No. Sir!

01:03:03.947 --> 01:03:05.447
Excuse me!
Michelle?

01:03:07.016 --> 01:03:09.251
- Sir, excuse me! Sir!
- Michelle?

01:03:09.253 --> 01:03:11.486
What are you doing?
Excuse me!

01:03:11.488 --> 01:03:13.789
Do you know
where Michelle Turner is?

01:03:13.791 --> 01:03:15.423
Sir!
Anyone?

01:03:15.425 --> 01:03:16.658
Michelle?

01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:18.026
Rey!

01:03:19.428 --> 01:03:21.029
What the hell
are you doing here?

01:03:21.031 --> 01:03:22.931
I'm so sorry, Michelle.
They just barged in.

01:03:22.933 --> 01:03:25.367
Do you want me
to call security?

01:03:25.369 --> 01:03:28.103
Oh, no, no.
Um, I got it. Thank you.

01:03:29.572 --> 01:03:32.574
Sorry. Could you just
come with me real quick?

01:03:32.576 --> 01:03:33.809
Yeah.

01:03:33.811 --> 01:03:34.910
Do you know we
were waiting outside

01:03:34.912 --> 01:03:36.411
in that lobby
for over two hours?

01:03:36.413 --> 01:03:38.480
I'm in meetings
all day. I mean,

01:03:38.482 --> 01:03:41.116
you can't just come
barging in to where I work.

01:03:44.854 --> 01:03:47.289
Rey, that, that night
we spent together...

01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:49.791
Hey, you all right?

01:03:49.793 --> 01:03:51.393
Yeah. Yeah. Um...

01:03:51.395 --> 01:03:53.161
Know what? I'll be back in
in a minute.

01:03:53.163 --> 01:03:55.463
Sweetie,
who's this guy?

01:03:55.465 --> 01:03:56.464
He's an old friend.

01:03:56.466 --> 01:03:58.166
We went
to high school together.

01:03:58.168 --> 01:03:59.601
Could you just give me
one more minute?

01:03:59.603 --> 01:04:02.370
Wait. You have
a boyfriend?

01:04:02.372 --> 01:04:03.471
Fiance.

01:04:05.174 --> 01:04:06.208
Uh...

01:04:06.210 --> 01:04:07.509
Why would you
tell me to come here

01:04:07.511 --> 01:04:08.944
if you have a fiance?

01:04:08.946 --> 01:04:12.013
You asked him
to come here. But...

01:04:12.015 --> 01:04:13.748
It's not even
like that, Luke.

01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:15.617
I ran into him
at my dad's funeral.

01:04:15.619 --> 01:04:17.285
No! That's not true!

01:04:17.287 --> 01:04:19.087
We never even went
to a funeral!

01:04:19.089 --> 01:04:21.089
Oliver, please.
Hey.

01:04:21.091 --> 01:04:22.490
Vacation, my ass.

01:04:22.492 --> 01:04:24.659
You never want
to go back, do you?

01:04:24.661 --> 01:04:26.161
Yes.
No. No, you don't.

01:04:26.163 --> 01:04:27.395
Come on.
'Cause you're a liar, Rey.

01:04:27.397 --> 01:04:29.431
You're a liar.
You're a liar!

01:04:29.433 --> 01:04:31.032
I want to talk to mom
right now.

01:04:31.034 --> 01:04:32.934
Okay. Okay, we will.
No! Right now!

01:04:32.936 --> 01:04:34.736
Relax!
Right now! Right now!

01:04:34.738 --> 01:04:36.504
Oliver. Oliver, please.

01:04:36.506 --> 01:04:37.472
No.

01:04:37.474 --> 01:04:39.174
You shut your face,
you bitch!

01:04:39.642 --> 01:04:40.909
Slut! Whore!

01:04:40.911 --> 01:04:42.911
All right, that's enough!

01:04:42.913 --> 01:04:44.379
Hey!
Jack!

01:04:44.381 --> 01:04:46.081
Oh, my god!

01:04:55.791 --> 01:04:57.192
Rey!

01:04:58.461 --> 01:04:59.961
Rey, wait! Please!

01:04:59.963 --> 01:05:02.197
What?
This is...

01:05:02.199 --> 01:05:03.632
This is messed up, okay?

01:05:03.634 --> 01:05:06.835
This is really messed up,
and it's my fault.

01:05:06.837 --> 01:05:08.270
Yeah.

01:05:09.672 --> 01:05:12.073
I didn't think I would ever
hear from you again, okay?

01:05:12.075 --> 01:05:14.209
I didn't think that you
would actually come.

01:05:16.679 --> 01:05:18.947
Well, I did.

01:05:21.817 --> 01:05:23.418
Yeah.

01:05:23.953 --> 01:05:25.220
Yeah, you did.

01:05:31.494 --> 01:05:33.461
What did you think
was gonna happen?

01:05:36.966 --> 01:05:38.266
I don't know.

01:05:39.568 --> 01:05:41.369
I guess, like an idiot,

01:05:41.371 --> 01:05:43.505
I thought things
could still work out.

01:05:49.979 --> 01:05:51.413
I gotta look
for my brother.

01:06:26.582 --> 01:06:28.750
Hey! Hey!

01:06:28.752 --> 01:06:30.685
Where'd you
get this car?

01:06:30.687 --> 01:06:32.220
That's
my son's car.

01:06:35.157 --> 01:06:37.459
Heh. Your son's?

01:06:37.461 --> 01:06:39.260
Talking about
two brothers,

01:06:39.262 --> 01:06:40.829
one about 25 years old,

01:06:40.831 --> 01:06:43.732
the other a little smart-ass
about 10, like that high?

01:06:43.734 --> 01:06:45.100
Yes.

01:06:45.102 --> 01:06:46.768
Aren't you supposed
to be dead?

01:06:46.770 --> 01:06:48.103
What?

01:06:51.108 --> 01:06:52.407
That piece of shit
broke down.

01:06:52.409 --> 01:06:53.908
I picked them up yesterday.

01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:55.510
Where did they go?
I don't know.

01:06:55.512 --> 01:06:57.512
I mean, they hopped
on a bus yesterday morning.

01:06:57.514 --> 01:06:59.547
They were headed
someplace by the coast.

01:06:59.549 --> 01:07:00.815
I mean, apparently,
they were going there

01:07:00.817 --> 01:07:02.083
to spread your ashes.

01:08:30.973 --> 01:08:32.240
Come here.

01:08:34.343 --> 01:08:35.609
Let me see those.

01:08:37.313 --> 01:08:38.613
I'll give them back.

01:08:57.265 --> 01:08:59.134
They're running the tide.

01:08:59.568 --> 01:09:00.635
What?

01:09:02.738 --> 01:09:03.872
That boat. See?

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:05.740
Here. Look.

01:09:08.144 --> 01:09:10.345
They're going
to where the tide moves,

01:09:10.946 --> 01:09:12.346
where it changes.

01:09:13.682 --> 01:09:14.749
Why?

01:09:16.952 --> 01:09:20.787
The fish feed where the tide
churns everything up,

01:09:20.790 --> 01:09:22.689
so the fishermen,
they go there, too.

01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:25.727
That's where
all the life is.

01:10:20.983 --> 01:10:22.250
Hey...

01:10:23.419 --> 01:10:24.953
I know you're mad, okay?

01:10:30.159 --> 01:10:33.127
You're a liar,
and I believed you.

01:10:33.129 --> 01:10:35.530
I didn't mean to,
Oliver, okay?

01:10:35.532 --> 01:10:38.533
I just don't want
to lose you.

01:10:38.535 --> 01:10:40.969
Well, I don't want to run
away from anything anymore.

01:10:42.838 --> 01:10:45.473
All I wanted was for you
and mom to stop hurting.

01:10:47.676 --> 01:10:49.544
And I wanted us
to be together again.

01:10:57.253 --> 01:11:00.488
Just, just come inside,
all right? Come on.

01:11:00.490 --> 01:11:02.156
You can't stop me
anymore.

01:11:02.158 --> 01:11:03.424
I want mom.

01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:06.561
You don't have mom.

01:11:08.130 --> 01:11:09.964
You got me.
That's it.

01:11:12.468 --> 01:11:13.768
So get inside.

01:11:14.970 --> 01:11:16.271
No.

01:11:17.906 --> 01:11:19.307
I said get inside!

01:11:19.908 --> 01:11:21.009
Make me.

01:11:21.011 --> 01:11:22.076
What?

01:11:22.078 --> 01:11:23.578
I said make me.

01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:28.416
Okay.

01:11:32.588 --> 01:11:35.857
Are you crazy?
Oliver! Stop it!

01:11:35.859 --> 01:11:37.959
Don't let me take away
the inner half!

01:11:37.961 --> 01:11:41.329
What do you when someone
tries to take something
from you, huh?

01:11:42.765 --> 01:11:44.065
Ow!

01:11:44.067 --> 01:11:45.733
Protect
the goddamn plate!

01:11:51.206 --> 01:11:52.340
Protect that, bitch!

01:11:52.342 --> 01:11:53.675
You don't know
what she is.

01:11:53.677 --> 01:11:55.743
I don't care!
Let me in.

01:11:55.745 --> 01:11:56.844
Or what?

01:12:03.352 --> 01:12:04.952
Ah, shit.

01:12:08.223 --> 01:12:09.457
Listen to me!

01:12:09.459 --> 01:12:10.758
You don't know her
like I do,

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:12.293
all right?
Let's get that straight.

01:12:12.295 --> 01:12:13.861
She doesn't care about us.

01:12:13.863 --> 01:12:14.929
She never did.

01:12:14.931 --> 01:12:15.930
You're a liar!

01:12:15.932 --> 01:12:17.632
You're a big,
fat, stupid liar!

01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:26.908
She used to leave us,
Oliver,

01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:29.644
sometimes for days
at a time, okay?

01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:34.048
And when she'd come home,

01:12:34.050 --> 01:12:36.918
she'd start yelling about
the house not being clean,

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:39.921
or she'd find something else
to blame us for.

01:12:39.923 --> 01:12:42.223
And I knew when it
was coming, all right?

01:12:42.225 --> 01:12:43.791
I knew when Bo was at work

01:12:43.793 --> 01:12:45.593
and she had us
at home alone,

01:12:45.595 --> 01:12:46.961
that's when
it was gonna happen,

01:12:46.963 --> 01:12:51.132
so I took you,
and I put you in your room,

01:12:51.134 --> 01:12:52.233
and I locked the door.

01:12:52.235 --> 01:12:53.935
This isn't true.

01:12:53.937 --> 01:12:55.703
You don't remember.

01:12:55.705 --> 01:12:57.505
You were
only two years old.

01:12:57.507 --> 01:12:59.374
I don't want
to hear anymore!

01:13:02.811 --> 01:13:05.646
If she did come back,
she'd come in high.

01:13:06.548 --> 01:13:08.082
Do you know what that is?

01:13:10.419 --> 01:13:13.521
Do you know
what high is, hmm?

01:13:19.094 --> 01:13:20.862
She'd start yelling.

01:13:20.864 --> 01:13:22.463
First about
something small.

01:13:22.465 --> 01:13:23.698
Then she'd
work herself up,

01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:25.633
and then she'd
start pushing me,

01:13:26.301 --> 01:13:27.502
hit me with things.

01:13:27.504 --> 01:13:28.770
What things?

01:13:30.372 --> 01:13:32.106
Whatever was around, okay?

01:13:32.108 --> 01:13:33.775
It didn't matter.

01:13:33.777 --> 01:13:35.443
Most of the time,
she'd throw things,

01:13:35.445 --> 01:13:36.844
shoes, whatever.

01:13:37.379 --> 01:13:38.679
She didn't care.

01:13:43.585 --> 01:13:45.153
Or she'd whip me
with a belt...

01:13:46.722 --> 01:13:50.858
A couple of times
with a baseball bat.

01:13:53.595 --> 01:13:54.996
You're making it up!

01:13:56.432 --> 01:13:58.199
Oliver!

01:13:58.201 --> 01:14:00.067
Oliver! Stop!

01:14:01.937 --> 01:14:03.171
Listen to me! Hey!

01:14:03.173 --> 01:14:06.207
Stop! Stop!

01:14:06.209 --> 01:14:07.341
Listen to me.

01:14:07.343 --> 01:14:10.411
One night, you came
out of your room

01:14:10.413 --> 01:14:11.746
and you saw her
kicking me,

01:14:11.748 --> 01:14:13.347
so you
started screaming,

01:14:13.349 --> 01:14:14.749
and you wouldn't stop.

01:14:14.751 --> 01:14:16.951
So she started
screaming back at you,

01:14:16.953 --> 01:14:18.553
and that only made you
more scared,

01:14:18.555 --> 01:14:21.956
so you started to cry,
okay, real loud.

01:14:21.958 --> 01:14:24.158
And she didn't know
how to get you to stop.

01:14:25.527 --> 01:14:26.894
So she grabbed you
by the face...

01:14:26.896 --> 01:14:28.296
This isn't true!
You're a liar!

01:14:28.298 --> 01:14:30.698
You're just making it up
so I'd stay with you

01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:33.601
and so I'd think she's
a bad person, but she's not!

01:14:33.603 --> 01:14:35.670
Listen to me! I'm not
fucking lying to you!

01:14:35.672 --> 01:14:36.938
I'm telling you
the truth!

01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:38.072
It's your mom!

01:14:39.475 --> 01:14:42.910
Even if she did,
i don't care!

01:14:42.912 --> 01:14:43.778
She's changed!

01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:45.746
I know she has changed!

01:14:45.748 --> 01:14:48.516
No! People don't
just change, Oliver.

01:14:48.518 --> 01:14:51.118
Well, she changed for me,
you asshole!

01:15:16.411 --> 01:15:17.478
Where are you going?

01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:18.746
I'm going home!

01:15:18.748 --> 01:15:20.882
No, you're not.
Get over here. Stop!

01:15:23.986 --> 01:15:25.553
I hate you!

01:15:25.555 --> 01:15:28.723
Oliver, stop!

01:15:28.725 --> 01:15:31.559
Stop it! Stop!

01:15:54.983 --> 01:15:58.519
<i> I'm trying to put
 the past in the past,</i>

01:15:58.521 --> 01:15:59.787
<i> if you'll let me.</i>

01:16:14.069 --> 01:16:16.237
I've struggled
for six years

01:16:16.239 --> 01:16:17.338
to tell you that.

01:16:21.577 --> 01:16:23.177
Did I leave
anything out?

01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:33.821
You know
what I think about?

01:16:34.723 --> 01:16:36.791
Know what I remember
about us?

01:16:39.761 --> 01:16:42.363
All the lies you told me
about getting cleaned up.

01:16:46.535 --> 01:16:49.136
And I loved you
and the boys...

01:16:53.709 --> 01:16:55.910
But you were never mine
to begin with.

01:19:59.828 --> 01:20:01.128
Hello?

01:20:01.963 --> 01:20:05.032
<i> Rey! Where are you?</i>

01:20:07.969 --> 01:20:09.236
<i> We'll be there.</i>

01:20:32.861 --> 01:20:34.128
Hey.

01:20:41.603 --> 01:20:42.870
You came back.

01:20:46.041 --> 01:20:47.408
I'll always come back.

01:20:56.484 --> 01:20:57.551
I'm sorry.

01:21:01.056 --> 01:21:02.456
It's not your fault.

01:21:05.093 --> 01:21:07.027
It doesn't hurt anymore.

01:21:11.099 --> 01:21:13.033
It's fine. It's okay.

01:21:20.008 --> 01:21:23.911
No, it's not okay.

01:21:26.848 --> 01:21:28.315
It's never okay.

01:21:33.255 --> 01:21:35.189
Did she really
do those things?

01:22:00.949 --> 01:22:03.384
Come on! Get in!

01:22:06.888 --> 01:22:08.322
Let's go.

01:22:08.324 --> 01:22:09.623
Don't be afraid,
okay?

01:22:09.625 --> 01:22:10.691
I'll teach you.

01:22:11.826 --> 01:22:14.328
Let's go!
Just a step!

01:22:17.699 --> 01:22:19.233
Let's go.

01:22:20.902 --> 01:22:22.569
Oliver...

01:22:22.571 --> 01:22:24.004
You trust me or not?

01:22:37.986 --> 01:22:39.853
Ooh, shit, that's cold.

01:22:39.855 --> 01:22:41.522
That is cold.

01:22:41.524 --> 01:22:43.057
Ooh, mama, mama!

01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:47.294
Hey, open your eyes.

01:22:48.663 --> 01:22:49.730
Open 'em.

01:22:49.732 --> 01:22:50.998
Am I doing it?

01:22:52.934 --> 01:22:54.001
You're doing it.

01:22:54.003 --> 01:22:56.136
Look. Come on.

01:22:57.472 --> 01:23:01.308
Come on.
Come out deeper.

01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:02.710
Now touch
my hand.

01:23:07.749 --> 01:23:09.616
Yeah!

01:23:14.189 --> 01:23:16.023
You okay? Come on.

01:23:16.025 --> 01:23:17.291
Let's go, punk.

01:23:43.752 --> 01:23:45.119
You okay?

01:23:45.653 --> 01:23:46.687
Yeah.

01:23:46.689 --> 01:23:48.088
How 'bout you?

01:23:48.090 --> 01:23:49.556
I'm here, ain't I?

01:23:51.192 --> 01:23:53.460
Oliver? Is he here?

01:23:53.462 --> 01:23:56.063
He's fine. Don't worry.
Where is she?

01:23:56.065 --> 01:23:58.165
Look, she's not
doing so good. I'm...

01:23:58.167 --> 01:23:59.800
Just hear her out.

01:24:04.706 --> 01:24:06.073
I'm glad you called.

01:24:08.109 --> 01:24:09.576
Oliver wants this.

01:24:11.579 --> 01:24:14.181
He thinks we can be
some sort of family again.

01:24:22.223 --> 01:24:23.824
When I had you, I...

01:24:26.795 --> 01:24:28.562
I was barely a teenager.

01:24:30.465 --> 01:24:32.533
Your father and me
were in love.

01:24:37.372 --> 01:24:39.206
And when he left us...

01:24:41.576 --> 01:24:43.310
I didn't know
what to do.

01:24:45.380 --> 01:24:47.714
And every time
i looked at you...

01:24:51.352 --> 01:24:54.988
I was reminded
of all the things

01:24:54.990 --> 01:24:56.323
I couldn't give...

01:24:58.026 --> 01:25:00.327
All the things
you deserved.

01:25:02.097 --> 01:25:04.398
And I had always
wanted someone,

01:25:05.133 --> 01:25:06.533
something...

01:25:07.435 --> 01:25:09.269
...to want me
like that.

01:25:10.872 --> 01:25:12.539
When I finally
got it, I...

01:25:14.309 --> 01:25:16.143
I didn't know
what to do with it.

01:25:17.345 --> 01:25:21.315
You were the living,
breathing proof

01:25:22.717 --> 01:25:24.852
of all the promises
we couldn't keep.

01:25:26.121 --> 01:25:27.688
Because somehow...

01:25:29.991 --> 01:25:31.391
I wasn't
good enough...

01:25:33.995 --> 01:25:35.662
...for the guy
that I loved.

01:25:38.166 --> 01:25:39.633
And is that my fault?

01:25:40.034 --> 01:25:42.102
No.

01:25:42.104 --> 01:25:44.838
No. It's mine.

01:25:47.208 --> 01:25:48.575
And I wish...

01:25:48.577 --> 01:25:51.612
I wish that i
could take back

01:25:51.614 --> 01:25:53.714
everything
I've done to you.

01:25:55.483 --> 01:25:57.217
I never
stop thinking

01:25:57.219 --> 01:25:59.253
about how
you had to pay

01:25:59.255 --> 01:26:01.722
for my failings
as a mother.

01:26:01.724 --> 01:26:04.391
And I know that i
can never right

01:26:04.393 --> 01:26:07.127
the wrongs
that I have done,

01:26:07.129 --> 01:26:10.531
but I had to learn
to forgive myself.

01:26:12.333 --> 01:26:13.600
And I know
you thought

01:26:13.602 --> 01:26:15.435
that I was trying
to forget.

01:26:17.205 --> 01:26:18.872
But I can never forget.

01:26:21.209 --> 01:26:24.778
And I'm hoping that,
with time...

01:26:26.981 --> 01:26:28.448
You'll forgive me.

01:26:30.051 --> 01:26:32.886
And you'll be
able to see me
as a mother again.

01:26:39.060 --> 01:26:40.694
How can I be sure...

01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:43.664
That you won't use again?

01:26:56.544 --> 01:26:58.645
Rey, when you
ran away with him...

01:27:00.515 --> 01:27:02.516
I felt like
i had nothing left,

01:27:03.518 --> 01:27:05.953
that no one
would ever want me.

01:27:13.127 --> 01:27:14.628
Oliver wants you.

01:27:18.132 --> 01:27:19.032
He needs you.

01:27:22.537 --> 01:27:24.404
And he believes in you.

01:27:26.274 --> 01:27:27.774
Just give me the chance.

01:27:27.776 --> 01:27:31.044
Give me the chance
to do right by him.

01:27:31.046 --> 01:27:33.680
I'm not gonna take him
away from you, Rey.

01:27:37.185 --> 01:27:39.286
<i> All I'm asking for</i>

01:27:39.288 --> 01:27:43.323
is the chance to be
a good mother to him,

01:27:44.025 --> 01:27:45.792
<i> and I am so sorry.</i>

01:27:45.794 --> 01:27:47.027
<i> I'm so sorry</i>

01:27:47.029 --> 01:27:49.463
<i> that I could not be
 a good mother to you.</i>

01:27:49.465 --> 01:27:51.798
<i> But I can
 be that to him...</i>

01:27:53.801 --> 01:27:55.335
<i> If you'll let me.</i>

01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:16.923
Mom!
Oliver!

01:28:41.616 --> 01:28:43.583
Why are you looking
at me like that?

01:28:49.957 --> 01:28:51.358
We're a family again.

01:28:54.095 --> 01:28:56.863
I mean, Rey, you said that
we'd be a family again.

01:28:57.865 --> 01:28:59.800
That's what this is,
isn't it?

01:29:16.384 --> 01:29:17.684
Hey.

01:29:25.326 --> 01:29:28.395
No, Rey, I will not...

01:29:28.397 --> 01:29:29.730
I'm not leaving you.

01:29:30.298 --> 01:29:31.631
Listen to me.

01:29:33.334 --> 01:29:35.268
You're gonna be okay.

01:29:35.270 --> 01:29:36.837
I don't want
to leave you, Rey.

01:29:38.407 --> 01:29:39.673
What do we
always say?

01:29:48.616 --> 01:29:51.752
I'm, I'm not going to.

01:29:54.155 --> 01:29:55.555
Just say it.

01:29:56.290 --> 01:29:57.891
Don't make me.

01:29:57.893 --> 01:29:58.992
Please, Oliver.

01:30:05.767 --> 01:30:07.701
Promise me
you won't forget.

01:30:08.436 --> 01:30:09.870
You can't forget.

01:30:11.038 --> 01:30:12.105
You can't.

01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:16.510
What do we always say?

01:30:21.749 --> 01:30:23.817
Protect the goddamn plate.

01:30:27.822 --> 01:30:29.923
Protect
that goddamn plate.

01:30:31.125 --> 01:30:32.192
That's right.

01:30:47.241 --> 01:30:48.775
I love you, buddy.

01:31:04.492 --> 01:31:05.759
All right.

01:31:11.332 --> 01:31:12.632
He's all yours.

01:32:20.501 --> 01:32:21.902
You did good.
