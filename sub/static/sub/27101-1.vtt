<i>Everything in my life
has lead to this moment.</i>

04:25.254 --> 04:28.689
<i>After leaving home,
instead of going to Vietnam,</i>

04:28.691 --> 04:32.126
<i>I was sent to an undisclosed
facility in the desert.</i>

04:32.128 --> 04:34.095
<i>We called it Koli.</i>

04:34.097 --> 04:36.831
<i>32 of the brightest men,
including myself,</i>

04:36.833 --> 04:38.867
<i>were teamed up into groups</i>

04:38.869 --> 04:42.002
<i>and assigned
each their own tasks.</i>

04:42.004 --> 04:45.073
<i>The vetting process
was mentally intense.</i>

04:45.075 --> 04:47.275
<i>So many questions.</i>

04:47.277 --> 04:50.778
<i>Confidential access was granted
to those who passed.</i>

04:50.780 --> 04:54.081
<i>Our primary objective
focused on research</i>

04:54.083 --> 04:58.855
<i>the government confiscated from
Nikola Tesla after his demise.</i>

06:59.241 --> 07:01.342
Hey, Miss Jeannie.

07:01.344 --> 07:03.811
Hold on just a minute.
Hey, baby, how are you doing?

07:03.813 --> 07:05.013
Good, good.

07:05.015 --> 07:06.814
He's in the back
if you want to go on.

07:06.816 --> 07:08.652
Yes, ma'am.

07:18.427 --> 07:19.828
Hey, son.

07:19.830 --> 07:21.666
Morning.

07:22.499 --> 07:24.898
Dropping off
or picking up?

07:24.900 --> 07:27.167
- Picking up.
- Well, it'll be

07:27.169 --> 07:29.706
that black riding lawn mower
on your right.

07:30.974 --> 07:33.141
It's going up
to the Drinker's.

07:33.143 --> 07:35.279
Right out back
on the right.

08:07.143 --> 08:09.245
<i>You about ready for bed?</i>

08:14.818 --> 08:17.117
Do you remember
what happened last?

08:17.119 --> 08:19.987
The man was... the fearless man
was boarding the ship.

08:19.989 --> 08:21.725
That's right.

08:23.126 --> 08:24.895
Okay.

08:28.198 --> 08:30.799
<i>"And the captain ventured off
into the unknown,</i>

08:30.801 --> 08:33.067
<i>"searching for treasure.</i>

08:33.068 --> 08:35.535
<i>"But he knew
there would be dangers,</i>

08:35.538 --> 08:37.975
<i>and a chance he would
not return."</i>

09:04.868 --> 09:06.099
That's all for tonight, okay?

09:06.101 --> 09:07.367
Let's say our prayers.

09:07.369 --> 09:09.069
Yeah, let's say them.

09:09.071 --> 09:11.305
- Ready?
- Ready.

09:11.307 --> 09:12.906
Now I lay me.

09:12.908 --> 09:14.074
Now I lay me.

09:14.076 --> 09:15.343
- Down to sleep.
- Down to sleep.

09:15.345 --> 09:16.544
I pray the Lord.

09:16.546 --> 09:18.011
Pray the Lord.

09:18.013 --> 09:19.546
- My soul to keep.
- My soul to keep.

09:19.548 --> 09:21.115
If I die.

09:21.117 --> 09:22.282
If I die.

09:22.284 --> 09:23.952
- Before I wake.
- Before I wake.

09:23.954 --> 09:25.185
I pray the Lord.

09:25.187 --> 09:26.453
Pray the Lord.

09:26.455 --> 09:29.424
- My soul to take.
- My soul to take.

09:29.426 --> 09:31.325
Good.

09:31.327 --> 09:33.560
Let's get you tucked in.

09:33.562 --> 09:35.429
<i>Good night, sweetheart.</i>

09:35.431 --> 09:37.598
<i>Good night. Love you, Mom.</i>

09:37.600 --> 09:39.970
<i>I love you, too.</i>

10:00.657 --> 10:02.459
Hello?

10:04.994 --> 10:06.363
Uh-huh.

10:11.301 --> 10:14.238
Can you give me
the exact...?

10:16.105 --> 10:19.109
So the meds didn't work.

10:21.577 --> 10:23.246
Okay.

11:13.463 --> 11:15.429
Hey, buddy,
you ready for school?

11:15.431 --> 11:17.598
Are you okay, Mama?

11:17.600 --> 11:19.903
Yeah, honey,
I'm okay.

11:21.338 --> 11:23.271
I'll go get
your uniform, okay?

11:23.273 --> 11:24.608
Okay.

12:12.022 --> 12:13.991
Grady!

12:24.334 --> 12:26.570
Dimensions are specific.

12:32.675 --> 12:35.112
Then what...?

12:39.715 --> 12:42.385
These crystals
were my father's.

12:45.287 --> 12:47.688
Crystals hold energy.

12:47.690 --> 12:51.494
If you learn to listen,
you can hear their sounds.

12:52.695 --> 12:54.594
They were programmed.

12:54.596 --> 12:58.065
By placing them out
at the right time,

12:58.067 --> 13:00.267
day or night,

13:00.269 --> 13:05.073
you can hear the sounds
of the sun or the moon,

13:05.075 --> 13:08.608
and all the other things
that other people can't hear.

13:08.610 --> 13:10.211
What about that one?

13:10.213 --> 13:12.082
This one...

13:35.138 --> 13:36.507
Yeah...

15:53.442 --> 15:55.376
<i>The butterfly
is a symbol of rebirth.</i>

15:55.378 --> 15:56.977
Do you know why?

15:56.979 --> 15:58.779
Metamorphosis.

15:58.781 --> 16:01.781
Very good.

16:01.783 --> 16:03.450
Should I let it go?

16:03.452 --> 16:05.388
Yeah, let's see
if it'll fly.

16:10.692 --> 16:13.426
<i>September 2nd, 1970.</i>

16:13.428 --> 16:15.463
<i>We just received funding</i>

16:15.465 --> 16:19.000
<i>to move forward on Tesla's
agriculture blanket.</i>

16:19.002 --> 16:21.434
<i>At this point,
we have proven</i>

16:21.436 --> 16:25.405
<i>that his magnetic
power generator we call Jack,</i>

16:25.407 --> 16:27.540
<i>combined with a Tesla coil,</i>

16:27.542 --> 16:30.544
<i>stimulates plant growth
successfully,</i>

16:30.546 --> 16:32.679
<i>reducing harvest time by half.</i>

16:32.681 --> 16:36.383
<i>But the plants have to be
in close proximity.</i>

16:36.385 --> 16:38.519
<i>We are impressed
with the results.</i>

16:38.521 --> 16:41.988
<i>However, I have
my reservations.</i>

16:41.990 --> 16:44.561
<i>There's something
they're not telling us.</i>

17:03.613 --> 17:05.011
- Hello?
- <i>Yes.</i>

17:05.012 --> 17:06.780
- <i>Is this Grady Lee, Jr.?</i>
- Yes, this is him.

17:06.781 --> 17:09.317
<i>This is the office
of Ethan Gosser,</i>

17:09.319 --> 17:11.018
- <i>attorney at law.</i>
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

17:11.020 --> 17:13.819
<i>We regret to inform you
your sister,</i>

17:13.821 --> 17:17.491
<i>Mary Corregan,
she's passed away.</i>

17:17.492 --> 17:19.358
<i>The circumstances are urgent,</i>

17:19.361 --> 17:22.096
<i>and we would like your presence
within 24 hours.</i>

17:22.098 --> 17:24.763
Okay. It's gonna take me about
11 hours to get over there.

17:24.766 --> 17:26.200
<i>Thank you.</i>

17:26.202 --> 17:29.669
<i>It's coming out
on different levels.</i>

17:29.671 --> 17:31.638
<i>For example, agrosonics,</i>

17:31.640 --> 17:33.741
<i>the use of sounds
to interact with plants</i>

17:33.743 --> 17:35.209
<i>to make them grow faster.</i>

17:35.211 --> 17:38.378
<i>There's even more research
that they can target</i>

17:38.380 --> 17:40.915
<i>specific frequencies
for specific plants,</i>

17:40.917 --> 17:45.289
<i>and they can accelerate growth
by 50, a hundred times.</i>

17:54.464 --> 17:57.400
I wish you could
stay longer.

18:25.962 --> 18:29.163
Uh-huh. Yeah, we can do 12:30.

18:29.165 --> 18:31.531
Great, see you then.
Thanks.

18:42.110 --> 18:44.677
Mr. Lee? Come on back.

18:44.679 --> 18:46.746
- How are you doing?
- Okay.

18:46.748 --> 18:49.116
We're here today
because your sister,

18:49.118 --> 18:50.885
Mary Ann Corregan,
passed away.

18:50.887 --> 18:53.154
She has hired me to write
her last will and testament.

18:53.156 --> 18:55.088
She also hired me to be
the executor of her will.

18:55.090 --> 18:59.026
She doesn't have any debt.
She had some personal property.

18:59.028 --> 19:01.428
She had no real property,
meaning she had no real estate.

19:01.430 --> 19:02.863
She rented her apartment.

19:02.865 --> 19:04.565
She had a small
amount of money,

19:04.567 --> 19:07.671
and she also appointed you
as guardian of her son, Kai.

19:16.579 --> 19:17.877
Mr. Lee?

19:17.879 --> 19:19.547
Now it's up to you
whether or not

19:19.549 --> 19:21.648
you want to be Kai's guardian.

19:21.650 --> 19:23.617
Well, what happens to him
if I don't take him?

19:23.619 --> 19:25.919
If you don't, he'll be remanded
to the state of Virginia.

19:25.921 --> 19:28.424
We'll place him inside
of foster care.

19:29.692 --> 19:31.157
Okay.

19:31.159 --> 19:32.725
Okay?

19:32.727 --> 19:35.229
- I'll take him, yeah.
- Perfect.

19:35.231 --> 19:37.798
There will be a package
and a letter from your sister

19:37.800 --> 19:39.802
sent to your home
on Kai's seventh birthday.

19:47.642 --> 19:49.645
I'm hungry.

20:25.814 --> 20:28.014
Wow, you live on a farm?

20:28.016 --> 20:30.653
How many acres
do you have?

20:35.123 --> 20:36.890
Wow.

20:36.892 --> 20:39.094
Like the house.

22:20.061 --> 22:22.799
I'm hungry.

22:43.819 --> 22:45.853
Who's that guy outside?

22:45.855 --> 22:48.291
Oh, Manna?

22:49.358 --> 22:50.723
Who's Manna?

22:50.725 --> 22:52.693
He's just a fella that...

22:52.695 --> 22:55.229
helps me out with a few things
around the house.

22:55.231 --> 22:57.063
What's he work on
with you?

22:57.065 --> 22:59.700
Splitting wood,
feeding the chickens and cows,

22:59.702 --> 23:01.137
stuff like that.

23:02.303 --> 23:03.936
He's your partner?

23:03.938 --> 23:07.744
Manna just kind of needed
a place to hide for...

23:09.378 --> 23:10.711
a little while,

23:10.713 --> 23:11.944
<i>and he's just passing through.</i>

23:11.946 --> 23:13.280
<i>He's a good fella.</i>

23:55.725 --> 23:57.359
I see you met
our new visitor.

23:58.828 --> 24:01.194
This is Kai.
Kai, this is Manna.

24:01.196 --> 24:02.965
How you doing?

24:04.366 --> 24:06.369
Kai, come on, load up.

24:07.837 --> 24:10.205
I got the tractor
waiting for you.

24:12.407 --> 24:14.107
Hey.

24:14.109 --> 24:16.979
Get the shop cleaned out,
get my welding gear out.

25:07.163 --> 25:09.128
Now listen,

25:09.130 --> 25:10.329
I don't want you
fooling around

25:10.331 --> 25:12.068
climbing on anything,
all right?

25:19.308 --> 25:21.107
<i>Well, here it is.</i>

25:21.109 --> 25:24.379
Why are we here? Where is this?

25:26.415 --> 25:29.081
It's a salvage yard.

25:29.083 --> 25:31.050
You ever seen
a salvage yard before?

25:31.052 --> 25:33.822
Of course not.
I live in the city.

25:35.590 --> 25:38.328
What car are we
getting parts from?

25:41.129 --> 25:43.832
I don't know.
Got to find it first.

25:46.601 --> 25:48.868
That's part
of the fun, though.

25:48.870 --> 25:50.303
The exploring.

25:50.305 --> 25:53.240
Looking in stuff,
finding what you need.

25:53.242 --> 25:56.542
It's kind of like a...
like a treasure hunt.

25:56.544 --> 25:57.944
What do you say?

25:57.946 --> 25:59.512
Good idea.

25:59.514 --> 26:02.417
Good idea? All right.

26:05.454 --> 26:07.354
All right,
remember what I told you.

26:07.356 --> 26:09.121
All right?
Don't climb on nothing.

26:09.123 --> 26:11.126
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, here.

26:33.014 --> 26:35.147
Oh, oh.

26:35.149 --> 26:36.916
Um...

26:36.918 --> 26:39.453
Boudreaux, this is...
this is Kai.

26:39.455 --> 26:42.055
A little buddy of mine's gonna
be waiting for a little while.

26:42.057 --> 26:44.023
And stay out of his way,
all right?

26:44.025 --> 26:46.295
- Yes, sir.
- Goddang it.

27:18.994 --> 27:21.563
These arms might work
for you.

27:54.596 --> 27:56.329
You all right?

27:56.331 --> 28:00.168
Yeah, something went down
my throat. I almost choked.

28:32.301 --> 28:33.936
Get up.

28:37.505 --> 28:39.271
<i>An hour-long investigation</i>

28:39.273 --> 28:41.707
<i>into the dangers facing
the U.S. power grid.</i>

28:41.709 --> 28:44.043
<i>What would it take
to bring it down?</i>

28:44.045 --> 28:46.379
<i>And if our system
did break down,</i>

28:46.381 --> 28:48.280
<i>how would you survive?</i>

28:48.282 --> 28:51.387
<i>And what would it be like
in the dark?</i>

28:55.023 --> 28:56.188
<i>My dearest Kai.</i>

28:56.190 --> 28:58.424
<i>Happy birthday,
sweetheart.</i>

28:58.426 --> 29:01.328
<i>I'm sorry that I can't
be there with you.</i>

29:01.330 --> 29:03.562
<i>If I had one wish,</i>

29:03.564 --> 29:05.732
<i>it would be
to watch you grow up</i>

29:05.734 --> 29:09.101
<i>and become the amazing person
I know you will be.</i>

29:09.103 --> 29:11.405
<i>The
United States electric grid.</i>

29:11.407 --> 29:14.107
<i>Are we ready
for a terror attack</i>

29:14.109 --> 29:16.076
<i>or EMP blast?</i>

29:16.078 --> 29:20.083
<i>And what would we do
if the lights went out?</i>

29:22.517 --> 29:24.686
This is awesome.

29:26.355 --> 29:27.753
Don't thank me.

29:27.755 --> 29:29.790
Thank your mama.

29:29.792 --> 29:31.627
Thank you, Mom.

29:42.071 --> 29:46.807
<i>I'll always miss our
walks by the river, our alone times,</i>

29:46.809 --> 29:50.013
<i>and being surprised
by the things that you say.</i>

29:51.679 --> 29:56.450
<i>I gave Grady something for you
so you can look to the heavens.</i>

29:56.452 --> 29:59.321
<i>You can use this
to find yourself.</i>

30:00.789 --> 30:02.254
<i>You're always
looking to heaven.</i>

30:02.256 --> 30:06.428
<i>It's like you see things
that no one else can.</i>

30:08.330 --> 30:12.732
<i>God works in mysterious ways,
and he outdid himself with you.</i>

30:12.734 --> 30:17.369
<i>Always remember,
I'm closer than you think.</i>

30:17.371 --> 30:19.508
<i>I love you, sweetheart.</i>

30:20.775 --> 30:23.045
Think I can see
the moon already.

30:41.863 --> 30:44.164
<i>December 24th, 1970.</i>

30:44.166 --> 30:45.898
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

30:45.900 --> 30:48.501
<i>Today, we had
a breakthrough.</i>

30:48.503 --> 30:50.203
<i>Team seven was testing a device</i>

30:50.205 --> 30:53.339
<i>that emits massive amounts
of frequencies.</i>

30:53.341 --> 30:56.475
<i>We are not privy to the details
of other projects,</i>

30:56.477 --> 30:59.279
<i>but heard their result
resembled that of an EMP.</i>

30:59.281 --> 31:02.781
<i>Sector E was completely
immobilized.</i>

31:02.783 --> 31:06.552
<i>And our Jack
woke up on its own.</i>

31:06.554 --> 31:09.923
<i>We will be combing through
the data for weeks.</i>

31:09.925 --> 31:12.462
<i>I'm beginning
to rethink protocol.</i>

31:40.222 --> 31:42.125
What are you doing?

31:42.858 --> 31:44.924
I fix.

31:44.926 --> 31:48.531
Lawn mowers
and weed eaters.

31:50.631 --> 31:52.264
Doesn't look like that.

31:52.266 --> 31:54.267
Because I'm not working on that
right now.

31:54.269 --> 31:55.668
I'm working on something
different.

31:55.670 --> 31:58.238
Then what are you working on
right now?

31:58.240 --> 32:00.643
Hmm, it's a surprise.

32:02.377 --> 32:04.280
What's this on the board?

32:05.414 --> 32:08.214
What's on the board?

32:08.216 --> 32:09.950
Different things.

32:09.952 --> 32:11.554
Hmm.

32:20.462 --> 32:23.829
Can you go find something to do
outside please, sir?

32:23.831 --> 32:25.764
What are these?

32:25.766 --> 32:27.570
Stuff.

32:39.281 --> 32:41.216
Whose is this?

32:43.017 --> 32:44.451
That's my daddy's.

32:44.453 --> 32:46.819
Where's your daddy?

32:46.821 --> 32:48.754
He ain't around anymore.

32:48.756 --> 32:50.656
Where did he move to?

32:50.658 --> 32:53.460
He ain't move nowhere.
He passed on.

32:53.462 --> 32:55.765
Is he where my mother is?

33:00.901 --> 33:02.801
My mom is in heaven.

33:02.803 --> 33:03.970
Yeah?

33:03.972 --> 33:05.905
Do you know anything
about that?

33:05.907 --> 33:08.875
No. I don't know about all
that kind of fairy-tale stuff.

33:08.877 --> 33:10.780
It's not a fairy tale.

33:11.946 --> 33:14.313
Buddy, if that makes you
feel better,

33:14.315 --> 33:16.715
then you believe that.

33:21.290 --> 33:23.322
I'll go outside
if you need me to.

33:23.324 --> 33:25.457
Why don't you go outside
and find you something to do,

33:25.459 --> 33:26.861
little man?

34:06.767 --> 34:08.500
Mm-hmm.

34:08.502 --> 34:10.272
Go on up there.

34:18.112 --> 34:19.714
Well?

34:25.554 --> 34:27.920
Who built this tree house?

34:27.922 --> 34:30.590
My daddy. He built it for me
and your mama.

34:30.592 --> 34:33.295
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

34:34.962 --> 34:36.128
Okay, you have fun up there.

34:36.130 --> 34:37.799
Yes, sir.

34:50.911 --> 34:53.445
But, I mean,
what can I do, though?

34:53.447 --> 34:56.116
Well, when we get there,

34:56.118 --> 34:59.418
just make sure my real beard's
not showing.

34:59.420 --> 35:01.087
- You know, that kind of thing.
- I can do that.

35:01.089 --> 35:03.155
I don't mind helping you.
I'll be right there.

35:03.157 --> 35:04.791
Good.

35:04.793 --> 35:06.525
I'll help you before,
during, after, whatever.

35:06.527 --> 35:08.828
- I don't care.
- Knock, knock.

35:08.830 --> 35:10.563
- Hey!
- Lookie here.

35:10.565 --> 35:13.532
Hey, Kai, how are you?

35:13.534 --> 35:15.467
What are you doing?

35:15.469 --> 35:17.936
I was wondering if Kai could
hang out with you for a while.

35:17.938 --> 35:20.105
Yeah, absolutely.
We would love to.

35:20.107 --> 35:21.474
- Good.
- Yeah.

35:21.476 --> 35:23.675
You want to come
stay with us?

35:23.677 --> 35:26.012
I got some toys out back,
and we'll go play.

35:26.014 --> 35:27.746
- Hey, how's that sound?
- Does that sound good?

35:27.748 --> 35:29.416
- I got to do some...
- Please?

35:29.418 --> 35:31.116
Come on, listen, I got to do
a little bit of work.

35:31.118 --> 35:32.886
I'll come back, okay?
Just hang out here.

35:32.888 --> 35:34.621
He'll come right back,
I promise you.

35:34.623 --> 35:35.954
Listen, Come on, now.

35:35.956 --> 35:37.489
It's all right.

35:37.491 --> 35:39.092
- Stop hanging...
- Come on, baby.

35:39.094 --> 35:40.626
Oh!

35:40.628 --> 35:42.594
Oh, come on,
that wasn't necessary.

35:42.596 --> 35:44.197
Come on, buddy.

35:44.199 --> 35:45.665
Come on.

35:45.667 --> 35:47.666
Come on with me.
It's okay...

35:47.668 --> 35:49.134
- No!
- Oh, please.

35:49.136 --> 35:50.770
- I'll be back.
- Come on, baby.

35:50.772 --> 35:52.672
It's going to be great, okay?
Okay?

35:52.674 --> 35:54.741
- I'll check back in.
- It's okay... Oh.

35:54.743 --> 35:57.643
- No! No!
- Oh. Oh, baby. Baby, come on.

35:57.645 --> 35:59.512
Come on. Come on.

35:59.514 --> 36:00.712
No.

36:00.714 --> 36:01.915
I don't want to!

36:01.917 --> 36:04.451
Oh, I'm so sorry.

36:04.453 --> 36:06.719
I believe you've got me
in a mess here.

36:06.721 --> 36:08.954
I'm fixing to get jumped.

36:08.956 --> 36:10.859
So, how you been?

36:12.594 --> 36:14.561
Why is Grady so mean?

36:14.563 --> 36:16.161
Grady's not really mean.

36:16.163 --> 36:19.868
He's kind of got a little bit
of hard heart right now.

36:20.902 --> 36:22.701
Ever since he was little.

36:22.703 --> 36:25.871
When he was five,
his mother died.

36:25.873 --> 36:27.877
She had an aneurysm.

36:29.076 --> 36:31.413
That affected him
very much.

36:32.647 --> 36:36.248
And he's lost his dad later on,

36:36.250 --> 36:38.918
which was my friend.

36:38.920 --> 36:40.152
What was his name?

36:40.154 --> 36:42.087
Grady, Senior.

36:42.089 --> 36:44.157
Your grandfather.

36:44.159 --> 36:47.694
And when he lost
your mama,

36:47.696 --> 36:49.565
he lost a big chunk
of his heart.

36:51.031 --> 36:53.866
It could be one of the reasons
he screams,

36:53.868 --> 36:56.571
he loses his temper.

36:58.272 --> 37:01.574
But he loved her very,
very much.

37:01.576 --> 37:03.643
Sometimes that calluses people.

37:03.645 --> 37:05.811
It makes them hard
in their heart.

37:05.813 --> 37:07.212
- Understand?
- Yes.

37:07.214 --> 37:08.882
And we just say
a little prayer,

37:08.884 --> 37:12.184
and we'll try
to get through it together.

37:12.186 --> 37:13.953
- How about that, buddy?
- Mm-hmm.

37:13.955 --> 37:17.023
We got to get over
that wall he's built.

37:17.025 --> 37:20.293
You think you can help
old Big Papa over that wall?

37:20.295 --> 37:21.860
Mm-hmm.

37:21.862 --> 37:23.631
All right.

37:47.656 --> 37:49.190
You needed something?

38:14.848 --> 38:16.885
Can you do that for me?

38:22.690 --> 38:25.060
Well, I can
give it a shot.

38:33.701 --> 38:35.169
For your eyes only.

38:43.310 --> 38:45.547
Thanks for stopping by.

39:41.802 --> 39:44.302
Hey, Manna.

39:44.304 --> 39:45.771
What?

39:45.773 --> 39:48.042
Do you have a son?

39:49.243 --> 39:50.979
No.

39:52.313 --> 39:55.217
What is it like
to live on a farm?

39:56.750 --> 39:59.018
Like living
anywhere else, son.

39:59.020 --> 40:01.090
Do you have a wife?

40:02.290 --> 40:03.755
Nope.

40:03.757 --> 40:06.027
What do you feed
your cows?

40:07.094 --> 40:09.130
What do you feed
your chickens?

40:11.065 --> 40:12.734
You know...

40:13.802 --> 40:16.101
you ask a lot of questions.

40:16.103 --> 40:18.704
Go play with someone
your own age.

40:18.706 --> 40:20.306
I can't find anyone.

40:20.308 --> 40:22.007
Yeah, well...

40:22.009 --> 40:25.147
I can't climb out of the gates
around this place.

40:26.815 --> 40:29.047
Listen, why don't you
go on home?

40:29.049 --> 40:31.317
All right?
Your dad's calling you.

40:31.319 --> 40:33.985
He's not my dad.

40:33.987 --> 40:35.957
Maybe you should
go inside then, son.

40:36.924 --> 40:38.693
I don't have a home.

40:39.893 --> 40:43.161
Not everybody does.

40:43.163 --> 40:45.898
What does
your dog eat?

40:45.900 --> 40:48.201
Just go on back.

40:48.203 --> 40:51.804
Tell me and I'll give you
a penny.

40:51.806 --> 40:55.440
What do I have to do for you
to answer my question?

40:55.442 --> 40:56.775
Just go home!

40:56.777 --> 40:58.444
Just go home,
all right?

40:58.446 --> 41:00.512
- I don't have a home!
- No one wants you around here.

41:00.514 --> 41:02.215
Just go home!

41:02.217 --> 41:03.985
Leave me alone!

41:04.819 --> 41:06.221
I'm working!

41:08.822 --> 41:10.324
I'm going home!

41:11.326 --> 41:12.927
Good.

42:18.192 --> 42:20.525
Son! No, hey!

42:20.527 --> 42:21.927
Come on!

42:21.929 --> 42:23.395
Get me out of here!

42:23.397 --> 42:25.998
Moses! Where's Moses?

42:26.000 --> 42:28.567
Get it open!

42:28.569 --> 42:30.268
- Let me out of here!
- There you go, come on.

42:30.270 --> 42:31.570
- Get me out of here!
- It's okay.

42:31.572 --> 42:33.973
Oh, my leg! Ow!

42:33.975 --> 42:35.409
Moses.

44:10.304 --> 44:11.536
Manna.

44:11.538 --> 44:13.507
What's up, brother?

44:14.708 --> 44:16.409
Come on in, man.

44:16.411 --> 44:19.344
It's time for you
to tell your story.

44:19.346 --> 44:21.049
You tell it.

44:26.154 --> 44:27.889
My name is, uh...

44:30.657 --> 44:33.027
My name is Manna.

44:35.529 --> 44:37.932
I guess I'll start off
with, uh...

44:40.668 --> 44:42.201
I'm a vet.

44:42.203 --> 44:45.237
I done three tours.

44:45.239 --> 44:47.476
I'm not a hero.

44:49.444 --> 44:51.013
I, uh...

44:55.549 --> 44:58.319
I didn't want
to serve my country.

45:01.522 --> 45:05.192
I just wanted to be able
to provide for my family.

45:06.259 --> 45:08.196
Food on my table.

45:11.565 --> 45:14.132
It was just me
and my boy.

45:14.134 --> 45:16.537
And, uh...

45:18.239 --> 45:22.144
You know, my son,
six at the time, he, uh...

45:24.344 --> 45:27.313
he didn't really know me
too well.

45:27.315 --> 45:30.052
So I planned a trip,
you know?

45:31.386 --> 45:33.585
We drove from lower...

45:33.587 --> 45:38.023
the lower part of Florida
to Alabama, and...

45:38.025 --> 45:40.395
I got... I got discharged
because...

45:42.263 --> 45:44.132
because of an accident.

45:48.402 --> 45:50.973
It's funny, you know?

45:52.473 --> 45:54.509
An accident.

45:55.409 --> 45:58.080
Accident.

45:59.614 --> 46:02.551
It's not really
what it sounds like.

46:15.763 --> 46:18.232
I hate myself!

46:20.668 --> 46:24.706
And I just want
to lay next to him.

46:26.339 --> 46:30.144
I don't care
if he's six foot deep.

46:31.311 --> 46:33.547
I just want my boy.

46:39.319 --> 46:41.087
The sound that I can't...

46:41.089 --> 46:43.190
I can't get out
of my head.

46:59.574 --> 47:00.806
What?

47:02.210 --> 47:04.242
Moses. My son.

47:04.244 --> 47:05.710
My son in the back.

47:05.712 --> 47:07.378
Moses.

47:07.380 --> 47:08.516
My son.

47:09.549 --> 47:11.583
- Help my son.
- Okay.

47:24.866 --> 47:27.134
I killed my baby.

47:27.868 --> 47:30.337
<i>I killed him.</i>

47:33.574 --> 47:35.444
<i>I killed him.</i>

47:36.377 --> 47:38.277
<i>God, please,</i>

47:38.279 --> 47:40.681
just take me away, please.

47:41.715 --> 47:44.453
Please just take me away.

47:47.455 --> 47:50.558
I don't want to be here anymore.

48:01.536 --> 48:03.672
You did good, man.
You did good.

48:04.639 --> 48:06.337
Okay?

48:06.339 --> 48:08.509
It's what we're all
here for.

48:09.543 --> 48:11.378
Just let it go.

48:36.469 --> 48:39.306
All right, I got it.
I got it.

49:20.014 --> 49:22.584
That'd be 1S 09.

49:41.034 --> 49:43.837
The same number
of degrees out there.

49:44.971 --> 49:46.807
Uh...

49:48.609 --> 49:49.974
Ah!

49:49.976 --> 49:52.344
That's the alignment.

49:52.346 --> 49:54.248
Now I got the position.

50:26.913 --> 50:28.482
Hey, bud.

50:31.351 --> 50:33.621
I just want to tell you
I love you.

50:37.525 --> 50:40.395
Daddy's not going to be back
for a while, okay?

50:42.763 --> 50:44.366
Manna.

50:47.435 --> 50:49.034
Thanks, bud.

50:49.036 --> 50:50.601
Welcome.

50:50.603 --> 50:52.573
Love you, buddy.

50:59.746 --> 51:02.317
I'm sure he's looking down
right now.

51:03.049 --> 51:04.585
Thanks, buddy.

51:05.819 --> 51:08.656
Come on, let's get you
out of here.

51:45.058 --> 51:46.794
Manna?

52:15.822 --> 52:18.690
How you doing, son?
Where'd them come from?

52:18.692 --> 52:22.661
It's by Mr. Ware
and Mr. Self.

52:22.663 --> 52:25.431
Hold up a minute.
Where are you headed?

52:25.433 --> 52:28.933
I got Kai in the truck.
I can't find Manna, so...

52:28.935 --> 52:31.436
You can't find Manna?

52:31.438 --> 52:33.070
He came to the meeting
last night.

52:33.072 --> 52:34.806
He got up and spoke.

52:34.808 --> 52:36.608
Bared it all.

52:36.610 --> 52:39.714
Told the whole story.

52:40.848 --> 52:42.449
You need to find him.

52:52.927 --> 52:54.996
Where are we going?

53:05.739 --> 53:07.605
Uh-uh, no, no.

53:07.607 --> 53:08.806
You stay in this car.

53:08.808 --> 53:11.645
Uh-uh, you stay
right here.

54:32.592 --> 54:34.628
It's looking good.

54:46.940 --> 54:49.273
- All right, Grady.
- Hmm?

54:49.275 --> 54:51.946
- I'm getting on out.
- Mm-hmm.

54:53.647 --> 54:55.016
I'm, uh...

55:12.232 --> 55:14.168
You look to the stars.

55:15.201 --> 55:17.235
I look to the stars.

55:17.237 --> 55:20.008
A lot of people say fools
look to the stars.

55:21.074 --> 55:22.609
We're not wrong.

55:23.677 --> 55:25.246
I want to give you
something.

55:28.748 --> 55:30.315
Four sides.

55:30.317 --> 55:32.650
Four different winds.

55:32.652 --> 55:36.288
The energy comes from all around
you and it's drawn to the earth.

55:36.290 --> 55:37.688
You understand?

55:37.690 --> 55:39.324
Thank you.

55:39.326 --> 55:41.161
You're welcome, Kai.

56:07.821 --> 56:10.157
- Kai!
- Sir?

56:11.759 --> 56:13.391
Get away from there!

56:13.393 --> 56:14.893
Go to your room!

57:19.860 --> 57:21.393
Hmm.

57:21.395 --> 57:23.797
Why won't you work?

57:24.498 --> 57:27.101
Hmm.

57:53.761 --> 57:55.263
Kai.

58:04.003 --> 58:06.174
Kai.

58:09.342 --> 58:10.911
Kai!

58:17.918 --> 58:19.420
Kai!

58:32.498 --> 58:34.134
Kai!

58:41.507 --> 58:43.210
Kai!

58:59.125 --> 59:00.794
Kai!

01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:35.322
What do you build
the top out of?

01:00:36.623 --> 01:00:40.328
Sticks and twine.
Sticks and twine.

01:00:41.661 --> 01:00:43.395
Pretty cool, huh?

01:00:43.397 --> 01:00:44.565
Mm-hmm.

01:00:45.933 --> 01:00:47.498
Where'd you get
all the sticks?

01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:49.099
All that wood
out in your yard?

01:00:49.101 --> 01:00:51.873
Young man, them woods,
they provide everything.

01:00:52.639 --> 01:00:54.639
Even your firewood?

01:00:54.641 --> 01:00:56.444
That's right.

01:00:59.212 --> 01:01:02.681
Is most of the stuff you have
homemade?

01:01:02.683 --> 01:01:05.552
I have a little bit
of everything out here, buddy.

01:01:06.686 --> 01:01:08.652
I don't like
living with Grady.

01:01:08.654 --> 01:01:10.721
I like staying here.

01:01:10.723 --> 01:01:12.259
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

01:01:13.592 --> 01:01:15.492
What's going on over there,
buddy?

01:01:15.494 --> 01:01:18.096
He... he never plays
with me.

01:01:18.098 --> 01:01:23.534
He's just always in the workshop
or away doing something else.

01:01:23.536 --> 01:01:28.509
He's obsessing
over that blasted machine.

01:01:31.677 --> 01:01:33.177
It'll be all right.

01:01:33.179 --> 01:01:34.614
I bet I could fix it.

01:01:36.415 --> 01:01:38.051
Probably.

01:01:38.719 --> 01:01:40.117
Probably could.

01:02:06.679 --> 01:02:08.114
Listen, I...

01:02:09.415 --> 01:02:11.451
I'm sorry for yelling at you
yesterday.

01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:16.389
It's okay.

01:02:18.592 --> 01:02:21.395
That machine's just
very special to me.

01:02:22.696 --> 01:02:26.567
Grady, can I show you
something?

01:02:29.036 --> 01:02:30.404
Mm-hmm.

01:02:40.547 --> 01:02:42.413
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:02:42.415 --> 01:02:44.484
Trust me.

01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:55.628
Now try.

01:03:40.239 --> 01:03:42.407
I told you to trust me.

01:03:46.513 --> 01:03:47.878
Thank you.

01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:50.348
You're welcome.

01:04:20.746 --> 01:04:22.846
<i>March 23rd, 1971.</i>

01:04:22.848 --> 01:04:25.382
<i>More members have been put
under my watch.</i>

01:04:25.384 --> 01:04:27.351
<i>Failure, over and over.</i>

01:04:27.353 --> 01:04:30.420
<i>We're on the edge
of a breakthrough,</i>

01:04:30.422 --> 01:04:33.291
<i>just to have success
ripped from our grasps.</i>

01:04:33.293 --> 01:04:35.192
<i>Jack will not stabilize.</i>

01:04:35.194 --> 01:04:37.462
<i>Something's got
to be missing.</i>

01:04:37.464 --> 01:04:39.898
<i>We've combed every page.</i>

01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:42.866
<i>We have to make this work.</i>

01:04:42.868 --> 01:04:44.668
<i>We're obsessed.</i>

01:04:44.670 --> 01:04:47.505
<i>If Jack can double or triple
crop production,</i>

01:04:47.507 --> 01:04:51.342
<i>the advancements would change
the food and medical industry</i>

01:04:51.344 --> 01:04:52.746
<i>as we know it.</i>

01:05:47.734 --> 01:05:50.668
<i>February 29th, 1972.</i>

01:05:50.670 --> 01:05:53.670
<i>Today was a devastating day.</i>

01:05:53.672 --> 01:05:55.840
<i>We lost seven
team members.</i>

01:05:55.842 --> 01:05:59.244
<i>We have no idea
what Jack is capable of.</i>

01:05:59.246 --> 01:06:01.445
<i>We pushed too hard.</i>

01:06:01.447 --> 01:06:03.014
<i>He quickly became unstable.</i>

01:06:03.016 --> 01:06:05.782
<i>But the power.</i>

01:06:05.784 --> 01:06:08.886
<i>Dr. Corregan, he introduced
the special crystals</i>

01:06:08.888 --> 01:06:10.721
<i>to harness the energy.</i>

01:06:10.723 --> 01:06:15.293
<i>Never heard of such a thing,
but it was brilliant.</i>

01:06:15.295 --> 01:06:17.731
<i>This changes everything.</i>

01:06:37.683 --> 01:06:40.384
Grady, you okay?

01:06:40.386 --> 01:06:44.489
So before my father
became a farmer,

01:06:44.491 --> 01:06:47.458
he was a scientist.

01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:50.460
Mostly government research,
classified.

01:06:50.462 --> 01:06:52.932
He even won
a couple of awards.

01:06:53.967 --> 01:06:55.833
And...

01:06:55.835 --> 01:06:57.969
I found his journal,

01:06:57.971 --> 01:06:59.804
and I found a lot
of his research.

01:06:59.806 --> 01:07:03.277
And it's full
of diagrams, and...

01:07:04.344 --> 01:07:05.576
this.

01:07:05.578 --> 01:07:07.380
Does this look familiar?

01:07:08.581 --> 01:07:10.748
- I made that.
- Mm-hmm.

01:07:10.750 --> 01:07:12.717
Now, according to the research,
and it took me awhile

01:07:12.719 --> 01:07:13.951
to get my mind
wrapped around

01:07:13.953 --> 01:07:16.853
exactly what it is
that I had here,

01:07:16.855 --> 01:07:18.422
but it seems
from what I can gather

01:07:18.424 --> 01:07:21.525
that the machine works
off of magnetism,

01:07:21.527 --> 01:07:23.628
and it creates its own power

01:07:23.630 --> 01:07:26.898
and emits electromagnetic
fields.

01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:30.802
Essentially wireless
electricity.

01:07:30.804 --> 01:07:33.003
Think of like, oh, um...

01:07:33.005 --> 01:07:36.808
water ripples after a stone
is falling in.

01:07:36.810 --> 01:07:38.976
And I'm not sure exactly,

01:07:38.978 --> 01:07:43.348
but this could emit
an energy field

01:07:43.350 --> 01:07:46.918
that goes on not just for miles,
but hundreds of miles.

01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:49.954
And it says here
that the magnetic waves

01:07:49.956 --> 01:07:52.357
can stimulate plant activity

01:07:52.359 --> 01:07:55.692
in a way that we've
never thought before.

01:07:55.694 --> 01:08:00.465
I just need you to help me
build these components.

01:08:00.467 --> 01:08:03.467
So, if you think of it,
think of the components

01:08:03.469 --> 01:08:05.036
setting down into it,

01:08:05.038 --> 01:08:06.804
which will allow it to spin.

01:08:06.806 --> 01:08:09.440
And according
to the information,

01:08:09.442 --> 01:08:11.842
that's going to c...

01:08:11.844 --> 01:08:14.078
create the electricity.

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:16.145
So...

01:08:16.148 --> 01:08:18.015
You want this to spin?

01:08:18.017 --> 01:08:21.051
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

01:08:21.053 --> 01:08:23.423
I can do it.

01:08:26.759 --> 01:08:28.361
Hmm.

01:08:29.027 --> 01:08:30.863
Okay.

01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:24.582
Look at you people.

01:09:24.584 --> 01:09:26.515
My goodness gracious.

01:09:26.518 --> 01:09:27.618
Hello, everyone.

01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:29.185
- Hey!
- How are you doing?

01:09:29.188 --> 01:09:30.621
- Randy!
- Oh, Aunt Meeko!

01:09:30.622 --> 01:09:32.857
Oh, I can't believe you.

01:09:32.859 --> 01:09:34.625
Oh, you sweetie.

01:09:34.627 --> 01:09:36.594
Well, good to see everyone.

01:09:36.595 --> 01:09:40.497
Looks like we're missing one,
but that'll be okay.

01:09:40.499 --> 01:09:43.502
Well, no, I guess
we're not missing one.

01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:46.805
Better late than never,
I guess.

01:09:51.477 --> 01:09:55.246
It's been a memorable
and wonderful life.

01:09:55.248 --> 01:09:56.680
Pretty day.

01:09:58.517 --> 01:10:00.150
Pretty ladies all around me.

01:10:00.152 --> 01:10:02.220
Could have told you that.

01:10:02.222 --> 01:10:04.956
I'm honored for y'all
to be here, thanks.

01:10:07.259 --> 01:10:09.260
Can't believe I made it.

01:10:09.262 --> 01:10:11.261
Sixty years.

01:10:11.263 --> 01:10:13.667
Pretty smile.

01:10:17.971 --> 01:10:20.674
Kai! Come here.

01:10:22.107 --> 01:10:24.143
You'll freeze to death,
you fall in that water.

01:10:28.514 --> 01:10:32.116
Let me introduce
you to my niece, Abby.

01:10:32.118 --> 01:10:33.687
Nice to meet you.

01:10:37.089 --> 01:10:38.890
Want to go walk
across the bridge?

01:10:38.892 --> 01:10:41.525
Sure, let me just
take off my jacket.

01:10:41.527 --> 01:10:43.961
- I got it.
- Grady, come here.

01:10:43.963 --> 01:10:46.133
Come here, I want to talk to you
a little bit.

01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:50.234
Give me your hand.
I want to hold your hand.

01:10:50.236 --> 01:10:51.935
Put your hand out.

01:10:51.937 --> 01:10:54.007
Come on,
give me your hand.

01:10:55.141 --> 01:10:56.274
Give me your hand.

01:10:56.276 --> 01:10:58.643
Thank you for fixing
my lawn mower.

01:10:58.645 --> 01:11:00.110
Grady...

01:11:00.112 --> 01:11:02.078
fathers have nothing
to do with blood.

01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:03.616
Be a father.

01:11:05.250 --> 01:11:08.989
Be a real father,
like Randy was for you.

01:11:10.322 --> 01:11:12.723
- I, uh...
- I know what I'm talking about.

01:11:12.725 --> 01:11:15.560
You're in the same
situation now.

01:11:15.562 --> 01:11:17.531
With Kai.

01:11:19.132 --> 01:11:21.032
Remember that, Grady.

01:11:21.034 --> 01:11:24.635
What's your favorite
thing to do in school?

01:11:24.637 --> 01:11:26.903
Science, math?

01:11:26.905 --> 01:11:28.573
I love reading and science.

01:11:28.575 --> 01:11:29.674
It's pretty fun.

01:11:29.676 --> 01:11:31.074
Mm-hmm.

01:11:31.076 --> 01:11:34.211
You know that everything on
Earth vibrates?

01:11:34.213 --> 01:11:35.912
And I can actually
hear it?

01:11:35.914 --> 01:11:37.247
What does it
sound like?

01:11:37.249 --> 01:11:39.850
Hmm. It just hums.

01:11:39.852 --> 01:11:42.619
Do you remember what...
what... what cont...

01:11:42.621 --> 01:11:46.290
which state's shaped
like a boot?

01:11:46.292 --> 01:11:48.125
I bet you can't
remember.

01:11:48.127 --> 01:11:49.793
I can't.

01:11:49.795 --> 01:11:52.363
Man, it's cold out here.

01:11:52.365 --> 01:11:55.299
Here, you can have
my jacket.

01:11:55.301 --> 01:11:56.701
I don't care.

01:11:56.703 --> 01:11:58.237
Thanks.

01:12:05.178 --> 01:12:08.813
Here, I think I want
to show you something.

01:12:08.815 --> 01:12:10.551
Can you move back?

01:12:13.820 --> 01:12:18.558
These are some crystals my mom
gave to me when she passed away.

01:12:24.664 --> 01:12:26.329
Wow, they're beautiful.

01:12:26.331 --> 01:12:31.003
Supposedly they're
programmed for something special.

01:12:32.771 --> 01:12:35.305
At the right time of day
and the right time I'm outside,

01:12:35.307 --> 01:12:38.141
it'll adsorb energy
from the sun.

01:12:38.143 --> 01:12:41.213
And if they're inside Jack,
they'll work.

01:12:43.249 --> 01:12:44.915
Ooh.

01:12:44.917 --> 01:12:47.920
You'd better say no. Uh-oh.

01:12:51.257 --> 01:12:54.261
Did you have a good time
driving them crazy?

01:12:56.129 --> 01:12:58.362
I don't think
we bored him too bad.

01:12:58.364 --> 01:13:00.230
Why don't you come on
in a minute, Grady.

01:13:00.232 --> 01:13:02.101
I need to talk to you.

01:13:03.169 --> 01:13:05.769
I got something
to show you.

01:13:05.771 --> 01:13:07.238
Come on.

01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:09.739
I don't have time
to come inside.

01:13:09.741 --> 01:13:12.244
What can I
help you with, Randy?

01:13:33.865 --> 01:13:35.935
This is the key.

01:13:48.780 --> 01:13:50.980
You've had this
the whole time?

01:13:50.982 --> 01:13:54.654
Look, you've gotten farther
than I ever thought you would.

01:13:55.887 --> 01:13:59.125
I hid it from you
for your own protection.

01:14:01.060 --> 01:14:03.129
How dare you.

01:14:05.263 --> 01:14:07.331
- I'm trying to help you.
- You knew what this meant to me.

01:14:07.333 --> 01:14:10.301
And shame on you for not
giving this to me sooner.

01:14:10.303 --> 01:14:12.036
Shame on me?

01:14:12.038 --> 01:14:14.438
I raised you, son.

01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:16.506
You need to do that boy
the same way.

01:14:16.508 --> 01:14:19.409
You don't need to worry about
what I do with that boy!

01:14:19.411 --> 01:14:21.912
You scream at me anymore,
you hickory head,

01:14:21.914 --> 01:14:23.447
I'm trying to help you.

01:14:23.449 --> 01:14:25.686
Calm down, Grady.

01:14:27.219 --> 01:14:29.452
You'd better listen.

01:14:29.454 --> 01:14:31.188
It killed your father.

01:14:31.190 --> 01:14:33.056
It's going to kill you.

01:14:33.058 --> 01:14:34.324
You hear me?

01:14:38.097 --> 01:14:40.064
You're just going
to have to let him go.

01:14:40.066 --> 01:14:43.967
Just got to let him go. Okay?

01:14:45.271 --> 01:14:47.537
Oh... oh...

01:14:47.539 --> 01:14:49.774
What is it? What?

01:14:49.776 --> 01:14:51.375
What is it?

01:14:51.377 --> 01:14:53.344
No, no, Randy.

01:14:53.346 --> 01:14:55.479
Listen... oh, my God.

01:14:55.481 --> 01:14:58.282
I'm going to call 911, okay?

01:14:58.284 --> 01:15:00.219
Grady! Grady!

01:15:09.795 --> 01:15:12.462
I need you over here.
I need you to make room.

01:16:06.552 --> 01:16:09.086
You look nice.

01:16:09.088 --> 01:16:10.857
So do you.

01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:16.327
Be strong tonight, okay?

01:16:16.329 --> 01:16:18.031
Okay.

01:16:22.901 --> 01:16:24.969
He came here for a little while,

01:16:24.971 --> 01:16:27.403
but he's gone back.

01:16:27.405 --> 01:16:29.475
I love Randy.

01:16:31.444 --> 01:16:33.943
Randy's not here.

01:16:33.945 --> 01:16:35.479
A few years ago,

01:16:35.481 --> 01:16:38.485
remember when I got so sick?

01:16:40.553 --> 01:16:41.918
I died.

01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:44.387
No heart. No lungs.

01:16:44.389 --> 01:16:46.293
No brain.

01:16:48.194 --> 01:16:52.199
And that's why I can stand here
and say he's not in this pot.

01:16:53.598 --> 01:16:57.136
Eternity is our home.

01:16:59.004 --> 01:17:00.507
I know that.

01:17:03.174 --> 01:17:05.378
It's for sure.

01:17:06.411 --> 01:17:08.147
It's true.

01:17:25.364 --> 01:17:26.697
♪ You can't mix your tears ♪

01:17:26.699 --> 01:17:28.535
♪ With those
From an agave plant ♪

01:17:30.268 --> 01:17:33.037
♪ You see, I've danced
With him myself ♪

01:17:33.039 --> 01:17:35.375
♪ He's never been a friend ♪

01:17:37.142 --> 01:17:39.443
<i>Randy was always
the kind of man</i>

01:17:39.445 --> 01:17:41.114
<i>that did the right thing...</i>

01:17:42.714 --> 01:17:46.485
without having to chirp in
everybody's ear about it.

01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:51.323
Wouldn't look for somebody
to pat him on the back.

01:17:55.294 --> 01:18:01.067
You know, recently someone
told me about a...

01:18:05.504 --> 01:18:09.910
someone told me being a father
is not about blood.

01:18:12.745 --> 01:18:16.079
It's about accepting an
opportunity to do what's right

01:18:16.081 --> 01:18:17.950
by another human being.

01:18:20.352 --> 01:18:23.222
I can accept that same
responsibility, and...

01:18:26.258 --> 01:18:28.028
do what's right.

01:18:30.295 --> 01:18:32.496
I appreciate everybody
coming out here tonight.

01:18:32.498 --> 01:18:34.601
It'd make him...

01:18:38.771 --> 01:18:41.137
it would fill him up.

01:18:41.139 --> 01:18:43.043
Thank you.

01:19:27.786 --> 01:19:30.820
<i>Randy, you have
been a dear friend to me.</i>

01:19:30.822 --> 01:19:32.622
<i>Like a brother.</i>

01:19:32.624 --> 01:19:36.560
<i>I leave with you the key
to my life's work.</i>

01:19:36.562 --> 01:19:40.130
<i>They unlock hidden information
that, one day,</i>

01:19:40.132 --> 01:19:42.131
<i>the world will be ready for.</i>

01:19:42.133 --> 01:19:44.268
<i>But it's not now.</i>

01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:47.270
<i>People are close
to finding Jack,</i>

01:19:47.272 --> 01:19:49.739
<i>and we're no longer safe.</i>

01:19:49.741 --> 01:19:51.207
<i>When the time comes,</i>

01:19:51.209 --> 01:19:53.243
<i>I trust you will
do right by me</i>

01:19:53.245 --> 01:19:55.511
<i>and potentially find
capable hands</i>

01:19:55.513 --> 01:19:57.549
<i>that can complete my work.</i>

01:19:58.683 --> 01:20:01.251
<i>As far as the other,</i>

01:20:01.253 --> 01:20:02.552
<i>thanks for taking Grady.</i>

01:20:02.554 --> 01:20:04.456
<i>It means so much.</i>

01:21:31.709 --> 01:21:33.745
We're done for the day.

01:21:36.248 --> 01:21:39.652
That reminds me
of somewhere.

01:21:41.654 --> 01:21:43.289
Come on.

01:21:54.967 --> 01:21:56.632
Um...

01:21:56.634 --> 01:21:58.202
- Thanks.
- ...here you go.

01:21:58.204 --> 01:22:00.206
Uh, let me see.

01:22:00.905 --> 01:22:03.243
One, two.

01:22:10.883 --> 01:22:12.716
And the biggest one.

01:22:12.718 --> 01:22:13.917
Okay.

01:22:13.919 --> 01:22:17.253
Big crystal,
big crystal.

01:22:17.255 --> 01:22:18.725
This...

01:22:20.226 --> 01:22:21.925
this.

01:22:21.927 --> 01:22:24.627
That's how the legend says
it's supposed to be.

01:22:24.629 --> 01:22:26.229
It'll be awesome
if it was.

01:22:26.231 --> 01:22:27.698
Uh-huh.

01:22:27.700 --> 01:22:30.466
We should at least let them
stay here for four minutes,

01:22:30.468 --> 01:22:33.172
then we'll try it
in a different location.

01:22:33.972 --> 01:22:36.006
If that doesn't work, well,

01:22:36.008 --> 01:22:38.845
I don't know
what to say.

01:22:43.882 --> 01:22:45.415
I think if you
set them out

01:22:45.417 --> 01:22:47.650
with the way that all
the shadows are showing,

01:22:47.652 --> 01:22:49.519
it will gain more power.

01:22:49.521 --> 01:22:50.787
See?

01:22:50.789 --> 01:22:53.790
See how the sun
goes through these crystals?

01:22:53.792 --> 01:22:55.492
Look at its shadow.

01:22:55.494 --> 01:22:57.197
That's pretty cool.

01:22:59.365 --> 01:23:01.331
We should let these sit out
for awhile.

01:23:01.333 --> 01:23:03.268
All right, let's go.

01:23:19.651 --> 01:23:22.855
Abby, does it look like it's
pointing towards the middle?

01:23:24.322 --> 01:23:26.226
Yeah, it looks good.

01:23:27.558 --> 01:23:28.958
But here, let me
help you a little.

01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:33.596
The light will be coming in
just in time.

01:23:33.598 --> 01:23:36.733
Is it supposed to be pointing
to the crystal in the middle?

01:23:36.735 --> 01:23:38.271
Right.

01:23:59.525 --> 01:24:00.991
What now?

01:24:00.993 --> 01:24:02.958
I don't really know.

01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:05.264
But there's only one way
to find out.

01:24:08.032 --> 01:24:10.270
Hand me that pot.

01:24:17.709 --> 01:24:20.844
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

01:24:20.846 --> 01:24:23.646
This light could blind you.
Can you leave the cabin?

01:24:23.648 --> 01:24:25.651
Okay.

01:24:29.088 --> 01:24:31.858
Kai, be careful.

01:24:33.424 --> 01:24:34.860
I will.

01:25:11.763 --> 01:25:13.333
Kai?

01:25:14.165 --> 01:25:15.868
Kai, where are you?

01:25:17.102 --> 01:25:18.734
Kai?

01:25:18.736 --> 01:25:20.339
Kai?

01:25:21.706 --> 01:25:23.508
Mr. Grady!

01:25:26.512 --> 01:25:29.615
<i>Crystals hold energy.</i>

01:25:31.583 --> 01:25:33.686
<i>You can hear their sounds.</i>

01:25:36.554 --> 01:25:38.825
<i>These crystals
were my father's.</i>

01:25:39.825 --> 01:25:42.528
<i>They were programmed.</i>

01:25:59.011 --> 01:26:00.577
What are you doing here?

01:26:00.579 --> 01:26:02.511
The crystals worked, Mom.
They worked.

01:26:02.513 --> 01:26:03.815
The crystals.

01:26:05.183 --> 01:26:07.617
I knew you'd figure out
the crystals.

01:26:07.619 --> 01:26:10.052
What do you mean?

01:26:10.054 --> 01:26:14.793
What's important is that Grady
can't finish without you.

01:26:16.462 --> 01:26:18.561
Jack reacts to harmony.

01:26:18.563 --> 01:26:21.832
And you can help him
with that.

01:26:21.834 --> 01:26:25.202
You can hear the tones
needed to program it.

01:26:25.204 --> 01:26:28.838
God gave you a gift,
sweetheart.

01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:30.774
And this is how
you can use it

01:26:30.776 --> 01:26:32.842
to make a difference
in the world.

01:26:32.844 --> 01:26:34.510
I want to stay here, Mom.

01:26:34.512 --> 01:26:36.112
Sweetheart.

01:26:36.114 --> 01:26:39.748
Now remember, just because
you can't see something

01:26:39.750 --> 01:26:41.486
doesn't mean it's not there.

01:26:42.221 --> 01:26:43.752
It's okay.

01:26:43.754 --> 01:26:45.991
Will you help Grady?

01:27:01.005 --> 01:27:02.771
Mr. Grady!

01:27:02.773 --> 01:27:04.573
No, get on, now.

01:27:04.575 --> 01:27:06.208
Go on.

01:27:06.210 --> 01:27:08.677
- Mr. Grady!
- Yeah, darling?

01:27:08.679 --> 01:27:10.747
Hyah! Get on.

01:27:10.749 --> 01:27:12.916
- Mr. Grady.
- Mm-hmm?

01:27:12.918 --> 01:27:15.252
He's gone.
He was there, now he's gone.

01:27:15.254 --> 01:27:17.753
- Who's gone?
- Kai!

01:27:17.755 --> 01:27:19.055
He just disappeared.

01:27:19.057 --> 01:27:20.890
What do you mean
he disappeared?

01:27:20.892 --> 01:27:23.993
I don't know
what happened.

01:27:23.995 --> 01:27:25.897
How long's he been gone?

01:27:53.157 --> 01:27:54.823
That bucket
was to protect him.

01:27:54.825 --> 01:27:56.596
Protect him from what?

01:28:07.806 --> 01:28:09.542
Kai!

01:28:12.910 --> 01:28:14.077
What happened, Abby?

01:28:14.079 --> 01:28:15.711
We were both in here.

01:28:15.713 --> 01:28:18.180
He told me to go outside because
the light would blind me,

01:28:18.182 --> 01:28:20.583
but then when I came back in
he wasn't there.

01:28:20.585 --> 01:28:22.152
He was just gone.

01:28:22.154 --> 01:28:25.090
We were just building
this time machine project.

01:28:39.004 --> 01:28:40.740
What's this?

01:28:41.807 --> 01:28:43.974
My drawing.

01:28:43.976 --> 01:28:45.908
Your drawing?

01:28:45.910 --> 01:28:48.043
Who's this right here?

01:28:48.045 --> 01:28:50.215
I don't know who they are.

01:29:16.674 --> 01:29:18.744
Kai!

01:29:31.088 --> 01:29:32.725
Kai!

01:29:58.917 --> 01:30:01.917
What are you doing?

01:30:01.919 --> 01:30:03.955
I went to see my mom.

01:30:09.828 --> 01:30:11.461
How'd you get out there?

01:30:11.463 --> 01:30:14.967
Grady, can I show you
something?

01:30:22.807 --> 01:30:27.342
"Then the captain
ventured off into the unknown,

01:30:27.344 --> 01:30:29.311
"hoping to find treasure.

01:30:29.313 --> 01:30:30.979
"But he knew there were dangers,

01:30:30.981 --> 01:30:33.283
and a chance that he would
not return."

01:30:33.285 --> 01:30:34.818
I know this story.

01:30:34.820 --> 01:30:36.385
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

01:30:36.387 --> 01:30:39.221
Would you like me
to read something else?

01:30:39.223 --> 01:30:40.924
Grady...

01:30:40.926 --> 01:30:44.196
will you ever leave me?

01:30:45.362 --> 01:30:47.329
I'm not going anywhere,
buddy.

01:30:47.331 --> 01:30:48.868
Okay?

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.268
"So the captain
loaded up his ship

01:30:52.270 --> 01:30:54.269
"with the men
that he had left,

01:30:54.271 --> 01:30:57.709
and he ventured out into
what was to be a new adventure."

01:31:00.846 --> 01:31:03.246
Is 528 the right number?

01:31:03.248 --> 01:31:05.782
That's what we're trying
to get it to.

01:31:05.784 --> 01:31:07.219
Okay.

01:32:26.530 --> 01:32:28.767
Whoo!

01:32:41.478 --> 01:32:43.246
<i>Well, there's something to say</i>

01:32:43.248 --> 01:32:47.884
<i>about an honest man
who doesn't give up.</i>

01:32:47.886 --> 01:32:52.287
<i>Someone so committed
that it propels them higher.</i>

01:32:52.289 --> 01:32:54.926
<i>Not for recognition,
but for satisfaction.</i>

01:32:57.062 --> 01:33:00.028
<i>Helps people,
even when he'd rather not.</i>

01:33:00.030 --> 01:33:04.100
<i>My father would tell me
the only thing a man has</i>

01:33:04.102 --> 01:33:06.568
<i>is his word.</i>

01:33:06.570 --> 01:33:09.538
<i>With it, he could
set an example</i>

01:33:09.540 --> 01:33:12.210
<i>and set the next
generation.</i>

01:33:14.178 --> 01:33:17.180
<i>I gave my word
to my friend Grady,</i>

01:33:17.182 --> 01:33:19.018
<i>kept it the best I could.</i>

01:33:19.950 --> 01:33:21.417
<i>And because of it,</i>

01:33:21.419 --> 01:33:23.418
<i>I experienced the joy
of being a father,</i>

01:33:23.420 --> 01:33:27.159
<i>and watching his son
become a man.</i>

01:33:29.494 --> 01:33:33.061
You know, me and my daddy,

01:33:33.063 --> 01:33:34.834
we used to...

01:33:36.301 --> 01:33:38.301
we used to come out here
and watch the sunset together.

01:33:38.303 --> 01:33:40.906
You know?
It was a...

01:33:42.673 --> 01:33:46.344
it was our one time of the day
we could spend time together.

01:33:47.945 --> 01:33:51.381
You know, actually,
the sun doesn't set.

01:33:51.383 --> 01:33:53.519
The Earth spins.
