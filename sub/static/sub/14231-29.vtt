Plus tax!
I ain't had a lunch break in 15 years.

01:59.786 --> 02:01.955

Does Petey get a break? No. 10 bucks!

-OK. First the arcade.
-Then the movies.

02:57.052 --> 02:59.637
-Couple of rounds of goony golf!

Look, whatever dad wants,
I'll get out of it.

03:12.567 --> 03:15.195
I'll be back in 15 minutes. Promise.

03:15.278 --> 03:17.697
OK. I'll wait.

You bellowed for me, Dad?
Dad! Are you OK.?

03:32.379 --> 03:35.465
Of course I'm OK.
W-W-Why wouldn't I be OK.?

03:35.548 --> 03:38.093
I feel great! Picture of health.
Brblbrblbrbl!

03:38.176 --> 03:39.761

03:39.844 --> 03:42.347
Why, nothing, son. I'm fine.

What gives?

03:48.895 --> 03:50.563
OK, I'll tell ya.

03:50.647 --> 03:54.234
But you gotta promise
not to breathe a word!

03:54.317 --> 03:56.945
I've been suffering
palpitations of the alter-ego

03:57.028 --> 03:58.822
with a twitchy-witchy-wabi
and a floy-floy.

03:58.905 --> 04:01.074
-What's that?
-You don't want to know.

04:01.157 --> 04:05.120
It starts with tickles in the ears,
first sign of degenerative earwax-ola.

04:05.203 --> 04:06.413
Next thing you know,

04:06.496 --> 04:10.166
your earlobes start flakin' off!

04:10.250 --> 04:12.377
Aah! Quick! Call a doctor!

04:12.460 --> 04:14.129
It's no use!

04:15.005 --> 04:17.424
What I got, they ain't even heard of!

04:17.507 --> 04:19.634
No! We gotta do something!

04:20.719 --> 04:22.846
Don't worry about me, son.

04:25.849 --> 04:30.854
Just take care of your mom and sis
and poor little Chainsaw!

04:30.937 --> 04:32.897
[sobbing]

04:34.774 --> 04:37.193
Me? B-But I'm just a kid.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.237
My kid!

04:39.320 --> 04:42.866

you gotta wear the pants, see?

04:50.457 --> 04:52.375
Me? Sell cars?

04:53.126 --> 04:54.836
Dad, I can't even drive yet!

04:54.919 --> 04:57.255
You wouldn't want your mom
to have to scrub floors

04:57.339 --> 04:58.757
and Pistol to peddle pencils

04:58.840 --> 05:02.802
and Chainsaw to pull sleds
in the great white north, would you?

05:02.886 --> 05:06.014
No! No! OK. What do you want me to do?

05:06.097 --> 05:08.767
Well, I'm glad you asked.

05:08.850 --> 05:10.769
Your pop's gonna teach
you everything I know

05:10.852 --> 05:12.354
about the car biz, which is plenty.

05:12.771 --> 05:15.607
I'll have you selling like a pro

Peej, where are you? What do you mean

05:31.956 --> 05:33.958
you promised to help your dad
count his lug nuts?

05:34.042 --> 05:35.168
We were--

05:35.251 --> 05:38.797
OK. OK. I'll meet you at the movies.

05:41.132 --> 05:42.801
Peej? Hello?

05:44.678 --> 05:48.431
Rule one, catching a sucker's
like hooking a fish.

05:48.890 --> 05:50.266
Just need the right bait.

05:51.434 --> 05:55.105
Madam, you're looking
at the automobile of the future,

05:55.188 --> 05:56.690
the light car.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.775
Light on pollution, light on gas.

05:58.858 --> 06:02.112
In fact, it doesn't use any gas at all.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.698
Well, that's amazing.

06:05.907 --> 06:08.159
She's hooked. Now reel her in.

06:12.664 --> 06:16.376
Uh, light on the pocketbook
'cause there's no engine to repair.

06:16.418 --> 06:18.003
What? No engine?

06:18.086 --> 06:20.547
Trying to cheat me, eh?
Of all the underhanded--

06:20.630 --> 06:22.924
Ha ha ha! Kid needs his eyes checked.

06:23.008 --> 06:24.426
Now over here...

06:24.926 --> 06:27.679
You got our latest
super see-through windshield.

06:27.762 --> 06:28.972
Never gets smeared with bugs.

06:29.055 --> 06:33.309
And today only, it comes with
free flow-through air conditioning.

06:35.145 --> 06:36.396
Uh, yeah, right.

06:36.479 --> 06:40.066
Flow-through rain, flow-through snow,
flow-through bird stuff-- Aah!

06:40.150 --> 06:42.569
No windshield?

is a bad habit of telling the truth.

07:21.483 --> 07:24.527
and Pistol will be selling day-old socks

07:24.611 --> 07:29.324
and Chainsaw will be working

08:00.271 --> 08:02.440
or are you going to cancel that, too?

08:02.524 --> 08:04.776
Yes-- No, I mean, sorry. I forgot.

08:04.859 --> 08:08.029
I-- Oh, yeah-- I promised Pistol
I'd cut her out a thousand paper dolls,

08:08.113 --> 08:09.531
and then I gotta help Chainsaw dig bones.

08:09.614 --> 08:10.740
You know how it is.

this summer, just say so.

Look, as soon as I get done
doing what I don't want to do,

08:18.540 --> 08:19.624
I'll meet you at Golfy Goon.

And everywhere you go, you trip.

09:08.882 --> 09:11.259
[whimpering] I'm fadin' fast.

09:12.844 --> 09:15.263

be scrubbing oil slicks

Oh, man. Open a whole hour already,
and still no customers.

OK. Rule 20, "not swimming in suckers?
Grab 'em with a gimmick".

Hey, hey, hey! Got to do it.
Didn't you hear me? I say I'm cured!

15:31.056 --> 15:33.808
I said I'm cured! I don't wanna go.

15:33.892 --> 15:38.480
I just hope I made enough dough
to keep my family outta the bread line.

15:39.898 --> 15:42.233
Mom, is this enough?

15:42.317 --> 15:43.818
Enough for what, honey?

15:44.652 --> 15:47.781
Enough to keep you
from buffing bugs off blimps

15:47.864 --> 15:49.741
and Pistol from selling used braces

15:49.824 --> 15:53.578
and Chainsaw from having to work
as a seeing-eye dog for bats.

15:53.661 --> 15:56.498
P.J., what are you talking about?

15:56.831 --> 16:00.710
Well, since dad's sick and
I gotta wear his pants,

16:00.794 --> 16:05.465
is it enough to buy you a bunch of bacon?

16:05.548 --> 16:06.591
What?

16:07.634 --> 16:13.014
He said his body's turning to trash
and I gotta sell buckets of cars

16:13.098 --> 16:16.601
or you'll all go down
the garbage disposal!

16:16.685 --> 16:20.188
So that's what his fishing gear
was doing in the living room.

rotten pineapple rind is fishing fever.

16:35.620 --> 16:37.914
Is that where you break out in fish hooks
and your limbs scale off?

16:37.997 --> 16:41.084
It's when your paint can of a father
tricks you into doing his job

16:41.167 --> 16:42.919

-What?

-He wouldn't.
-He could, he would, he did.

Aah! Aah!

16:51.803 --> 16:55.557
Now, now, now.
Fishing fever is a very stubborn disease.

16:55.640 --> 17:00.186
So I'm afraid the cure
will have to be drastic.
