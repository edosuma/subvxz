11:16.023 --> 11:17.677
- It's about
Rachel Wilson's suicide.

11:17.720 --> 11:21.332
The investigators recovered
her cell phone from the scene.

11:21.376 --> 11:22.986
She made a video statement

11:23.030 --> 11:25.206
right before
she killed herself.

11:27.643 --> 11:29.036
- Several years ago,

11:29.079 --> 11:33.040
I was violently assaulted
and raped

11:33.083 --> 11:35.695
by a superior officer.

11:35.738 --> 11:39.220
I went to my sergeant, IAB.

11:39.263 --> 11:43.354
They all conspired
to protect my attacker.

11:43.398 --> 11:48.490
I'd name names here,
but it doesn't matter anymore.

11:48.533 --> 11:51.798
He won.
I lost.

11:54.061 --> 11:57.455
I so was proud to be a cop...

12:00.241 --> 12:02.591
But the system betrayed me.

12:02.634 --> 12:07.552
NYPD will always protect
who they see as their own...

12:08.249 --> 12:10.860
And they didn't protect me.

12:13.645 --> 12:17.824
Anyway, I've said my piece.

12:18.694 --> 12:20.827
- Now we know why she threw
that drink at Tucker.

12:20.870 --> 12:22.785
- And he said
he has no idea why.

12:22.829 --> 12:25.657
- And you believe him?

12:25.701 --> 12:29.226
- I don't know what to believe,

12:29.270 --> 12:32.229
and I don't know what
to do about it.

12:32.273 --> 12:33.970
- Yes, you do.

12:35.276 --> 12:37.321

12:40.020 --> 12:41.586
- You've got to forgive us.

12:41.630 --> 12:43.153
We just closed down
the house last week

12:43.197 --> 12:44.894
so everything's at
sixes and sevens.

12:44.938 --> 12:46.940
- Oh,
I know what that's like.

12:46.983 --> 12:49.377
- Ed, you have company.

12:49.420 --> 12:51.292
- Olivia.
- Hey.

12:51.335 --> 12:53.773
I'm sorry to barge in.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.428
- Thanks.

12:57.472 --> 13:00.257
- What's going on?
Is this about Rachel Wilson?

13:00.301 --> 13:01.302
- It is.

13:01.345 --> 13:04.000
It turns out
that Rachel made a video

13:04.044 --> 13:06.829
before she shot herself.

13:06.873 --> 13:09.397
She said that she was
sexually assaulted

13:09.440 --> 13:12.487
by a colleague on a job.

13:12.530 --> 13:13.793
- Did she give a name?

13:13.836 --> 13:16.230
- No, but she said
there was a cover-up.

13:16.273 --> 13:20.800
She brought it to IAB, but
there was nothing in the files.

13:21.844 --> 13:24.455
- First I'm hearing about it.

13:24.499 --> 13:26.414
- Really?

13:26.457 --> 13:29.286
'Cause it seemed like
she knew you at the party.

13:29.330 --> 13:31.158
What was that about?

13:32.855 --> 13:36.032
- I'm not sure.
How long ago?

13:36.946 --> 13:39.470
- I was hoping
that you could tell me.

13:41.908 --> 13:45.346
Ed, she--she threw a drink
at you.

13:46.477 --> 13:51.221
- I'm sorry.
I'm at a loss, Liv.

13:52.875 --> 13:55.617
I must've done
600 cases at IAB.

13:55.660 --> 13:58.838
I'd, you know,
have to dig out my notes.

14:00.274 --> 14:03.886
- I want to believe you, Ed.
I do, but...

14:03.930 --> 14:05.975
you just did something
that you never did

14:06.019 --> 14:08.543
when we were together.

14:08.586 --> 14:10.980
- What's that?

but I don't think so.

14:29.346 --> 14:30.608
Tucker seemed off.

Are we supposed to

14:36.701 --> 14:38.486
go back and check every
supervisor she's ever had?

the net that wide,

14:40.923 --> 14:43.839
let's look into who was
in her life now.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.450
Maybe she disclosed
to someone.

You people didn't honor her

honor her in death.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.202

15:06.557 --> 15:08.385
- I knew her
since she was a child.

15:08.429 --> 15:10.822
I saw her go from being
top of her class

15:10.866 --> 15:13.869

Now did she tell you
anything about that?

15:30.277 --> 15:31.887

15:31.931 --> 15:35.935
She said she'd been raped
by someone she worked with.

15:35.978 --> 15:38.763

when she was at Vice.

- Well, uh,
I didn't know her that well.

16:45.656 --> 16:47.223
I mean,
a few months after I came in,

16:47.267 --> 16:48.442
she transferred out.

16:48.485 --> 16:50.096

I told the Captain

16:50.139 --> 16:52.837
that you were
a straight shooter.

16:52.881 --> 16:55.666

speaking ill of the dead,

but Rachel, she got around.

before me could tell you more.

she was something.

A euphemism?

18:06.998 --> 18:09.914
- You were on the job, right?
- Yeah.

18:12.526 --> 18:14.267
- She was
a talented undercover,

18:14.310 --> 18:15.877
but she had issues.

18:15.920 --> 18:17.705
- Turns out she made
a video in the car.

18:17.748 --> 18:19.489
- Yeah, I heard your captain
already talked

18:19.533 --> 18:21.578
to Ed Tucker about that.

18:22.840 --> 18:25.147
- Ever hear any talk about
Rachel being assaulted

while she was at Vice?

18:26.540 --> 18:29.195
- Rachel.
Cone of silence?

18:29.238 --> 18:30.892
- Yeah.

a live sex grenade

18:35.331 --> 18:37.072
She rolled

to back away,

she'd threaten
to blow his life up.

18:40.815 --> 18:42.338
I warned Tucker about this

18:42.382 --> 18:44.862
when he called me
chasing some story,

18:44.906 --> 18:48.518
but Rachel put new meaning
into Internal Affairs.

18:48.562 --> 18:50.738
- So Tucker really did
look into this.

18:50.781 --> 18:52.479
- Yeah, he came
to the same conclusion--

18:52.522 --> 18:54.785
that Rachel was a fabricator.

18:56.961 --> 18:58.659
I mean, I tried to help her,
but you know,

18:58.702 --> 19:01.749
sometimes when you try to save
a drowner, she pulls you under.

We have a few questions.

19:25.990 --> 19:27.992
Avoid embarrassing me
in front of my family?

19:28.036 --> 19:29.777
- You do that
when you were IAB?

19:29.820 --> 19:31.605
- That was different.

19:31.648 --> 19:33.694
I was dealing with dirty cops.

19:36.392 --> 19:38.394
Can you give me a minute
and let me tell my wife

19:38.438 --> 19:39.874
where I'm going?

19:39.917 --> 19:41.702

you didn't know Rachel Wilson?

19:51.929 --> 19:55.324
- No, what I said was,
"I couldn't place her."

19:55.368 --> 19:57.979
- But you were at IAB
when Rachel Wilson claimed

19:58.022 --> 19:59.981
she was assaulted
by somebody at Vice, right?

20:00.024 --> 20:01.417
- I was.

20:01.461 --> 20:03.941
That was 15 years ago.

20:03.985 --> 20:06.292
I honestly had no memory
of it at first.

20:06.335 --> 20:08.859
- At first, but--
but you do now.

20:08.903 --> 20:12.428
- Yeah, it, um...
it came back to me.

20:12.472 --> 20:15.301
She, uh, she talked about
filing a complaint,

20:15.344 --> 20:17.564
but it never went anywhere.

20:17.607 --> 20:21.698
- She accused Gary Wald,
right?

20:21.742 --> 20:24.223
Your former partner?

20:26.355 --> 20:28.270
- Yes or no, Tucker?

20:28.314 --> 20:30.446
- Yes, she did.

20:30.490 --> 20:32.187
We looked into it.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.494
There were charges
and countercharges.

20:34.537 --> 20:36.017
- Between Rachel and Gary?

20:36.060 --> 20:37.627
- About the assault, yeah.

20:37.671 --> 20:39.150
But also about
other relationships

20:39.194 --> 20:42.197

with other guys on the job.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.286
If she had filed
a formal complaint

20:44.330 --> 20:45.809
against Gary at that time,

20:45.853 --> 20:47.507
there would've been
four broken marriages,

20:47.550 --> 20:48.986
her career
would have been ruined.

20:49.030 --> 20:52.512
- It was ruined anyway.
She fell apart.

20:52.555 --> 20:55.036
- Yeah, I know,

20:55.079 --> 20:58.344
and I feel terrible about that.

20:59.954 --> 21:01.825
But at the end of the day,

21:01.869 --> 21:03.784
it was her choice
not to pursue.

21:05.394 --> 21:06.874
- "Her choice."

21:06.917 --> 21:08.745
It sounds like
she was slut-shamed

21:08.789 --> 21:10.094
into keeping her mouth shut,

21:10.138 --> 21:11.879
and Tucker made sure
she understood

21:11.922 --> 21:13.533
exactly how that
was gonna play out.

21:13.576 --> 21:18.146

Tucker covering up a rape,

21:18.189 --> 21:21.976

21:22.019 --> 21:23.325
- It happens all the time,
Liv,

he's still covering it up.

have information relevant

25:18.517 --> 25:20.344

all three of them plus a UC.

26:01.647 --> 26:03.997

I don't believe that.

26:04.040 --> 26:06.608

Gary's leverage over him.

the burner cell.

so after Rachel's suicide,

Ralphie feels guilt,

Gary leans on him
to keep quiet, and...

Ralphie just doesn't see
another way out.

26:27.890 --> 26:29.631
the two suicides may well
have been the result

26:29.675 --> 26:31.111
of the crime and a cover-up,

26:31.154 --> 26:32.982
and Dr. Lindstrom
has a duty to warn.

26:33.026 --> 26:35.419
He may have information that
could stop yet another officer

26:35.463 --> 26:36.986
