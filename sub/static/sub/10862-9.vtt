00:28.720 --> 00:30.160
Tonight's
a special night.

00:30.160 --> 00:32.000
It was a year
ago tonight

00:32.000 --> 00:34.920
that David brought
Frank into our circle

00:34.920 --> 00:37.840
so he could tell the
tale that made him

00:37.840 --> 00:39.720
a member of the
Midnight Society.

00:39.720 --> 00:42.680
"The Tale
of the Phantom Cab."

00:42.680 --> 00:45.040
"Vink's the name--
Dr. Vink."

00:45.040 --> 00:47.040
"With a VVV, VVV, VVV, VVV!"

00:51.400 --> 00:54.840
It's been our tradition
to tell us a scary tale.

00:54.840 --> 00:56.680
Do you have one, Frank?

00:56.680 --> 01:00.360
Oh, yeah.
I've got one.

01:00.360 --> 01:01.960
I've got
the perfect story

01:01.960 --> 01:03.680
for a night
like this.

01:05.640 --> 01:07.920
[Girl]
Full moon.

01:07.920 --> 01:10.040
[Frank]
Exactly.

01:10.040 --> 01:13.280
Eerie things happen
when the moon is full.

01:13.280 --> 01:15.280
People always act, uh...

01:15.280 --> 01:17.280
A little bit different,

01:17.280 --> 01:19.560
a little... strange.

01:20.880 --> 01:24.280
But to anybody who's ever
told a tale of terror,

01:24.280 --> 01:26.280
there's one special thing

01:26.280 --> 01:29.360
that always happens
when the full moon rises...

01:33.200 --> 01:36.320
And that's what
my story is about.

01:36.320 --> 01:40.800
Submitted for the approval
of the Midnight Society,

01:40.800 --> 01:43.040
I call this story...

02:02.320 --> 02:04.760
[Frank] Jed and hughie
were pet detectives.

02:04.760 --> 02:06.760
You know,
they'd find missing dogs,

02:06.760 --> 02:08.919
runaway parakeets,
that kind of thing.

02:08.919 --> 02:10.240
They'd just been hired

02:10.240 --> 02:11.600
by Mrs. Neville

02:11.600 --> 02:13.440
to find their lost cat misty.

02:13.440 --> 02:15.920
It seemed like
an open-and-shut case--

02:15.920 --> 02:17.080
at first.

02:17.080 --> 02:18.360
Catnip mouse.

02:18.360 --> 02:20.240
Catnip mouse--check.

02:20.240 --> 02:22.760
Why did you charge
Mrs. Neville $20?

02:22.760 --> 02:25.520
Our rate for missing
cats is only $5.

02:25.520 --> 02:28.080
Yeah, but the puppies
at the pet shop

02:28.080 --> 02:29.440
are 20 bucks apiece.

02:29.440 --> 02:30.880
Squeezy rubber hamburger.

02:30.880 --> 02:33.040
Squeezy rubber
hamburger--check.

02:33.040 --> 02:35.600
But your mom said
you can't have a dog.

02:35.600 --> 02:38.240
She'll change her mind
when she sees this.

02:38.240 --> 02:39.760
Where's that
silver whistle--

02:39.760 --> 02:41.760
the one only
dogs can hear?

02:41.760 --> 02:43.400
It should be here
someplace.

02:43.400 --> 02:44.920
But what if
she doesn't?

02:44.920 --> 02:46.280
She has to.

02:46.280 --> 02:48.920
<i>I'm tired of playing
fetch the stick with you.</i>

02:48.920 --> 02:51.280
Me, too.
Splinters hurt my tongue.

02:51.280 --> 02:53.200
It's practically
a law--

02:53.200 --> 02:54.600
I'm a boy,

02:54.600 --> 02:56.960
and a boy's supposed to
have a dog.

02:56.960 --> 03:00.280
As soon as we find Misty,
I'm going to buy one.

03:00.280 --> 03:01.280
Aah!

03:02.280 --> 03:04.200
What's wrong?

03:04.200 --> 03:06.720
Found the whistle.

Here, kitty.

03:53.520 --> 03:54.240

04:32.200 --> 04:33.760
Here, Misty.

04:39.920 --> 04:41.280
Found you.

04:43.760 --> 04:45.680
Rin Tin Tin to Lassie.

04:45.680 --> 04:47.520
I think I found Misty--

04:47.520 --> 04:50.280
the house across the
street from my place.

04:51.760 --> 04:53.720
[Boy]
Lassie to Rin Tin Tin.

04:53.720 --> 04:56.040
I got to go home
for dinner.

04:56.040 --> 04:57.560
I'm going in. Over.

05:51.240 --> 05:54.840

[Boy on walkie-talkie]
Lassie to Rin Tin Tin.

07:37.240 --> 07:39.360
I got to go home
for dinner,

07:39.360 --> 07:42.240
or my mom's going to
kill me. Over.

07:42.240 --> 07:44.400
I'll call you back.

08:21.120 --> 08:25.520
[Woman] That is the most
ridiculous story I have ever heard.

08:25.520 --> 08:26.880
But it's true!

08:26.880 --> 08:28.560
His fridge
was full of meat.

08:28.560 --> 08:31.560
I bet he's got his eye on
every pet in the neighborhood--

08:31.560 --> 08:33.039
dog burgers, fried canary,

08:33.039 --> 08:34.200
hamster soup.

08:34.200 --> 08:37.039
Jed, I have had
about enough of this.

08:37.039 --> 08:38.360
But, Mom--

08:38.360 --> 08:40.039
Don't "but, Mom" me.

08:40.039 --> 08:43.039
I know exactly what
you're up to, young man.

08:43.039 --> 08:45.400
This is another one
of your cockamamie

08:45.400 --> 08:47.520
"I want a dog" schemes,
isn't it?

08:47.520 --> 08:48.520
What?

08:48.520 --> 08:50.040
You figure
I'm going to believe

08:50.040 --> 08:51.600
this silly story
of yours

08:51.600 --> 08:54.560
and let you bring home every
single stray in the neighborhood

08:54.560 --> 08:56.040
just to protect them

08:56.040 --> 08:58.640
from the butcher
of maple street.

08:58.640 --> 09:00.240
Not this time, kiddo.

09:00.240 --> 09:03.000
We're just barely
getting by as it is.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.840
We can't afford
another mouth to feed--

09:05.840 --> 09:08.160
even if it does
have four legs

09:08.160 --> 09:09.920
and brings in the mail.

09:09.920 --> 09:12.080
Dad would have
believed me.

09:17.560 --> 09:19.760
He probably would.

Ohh! Aah!

10:24.520 --> 10:27.040
Aah! Aah!

10:27.040 --> 10:28.040
Ohh!

10:34.440 --> 10:36.760
[Growling]

10:44.480 --> 10:46.120
Mom!

10:46.120 --> 10:48.640
What is it?
What's the matter?

10:50.480 --> 10:51.920
[Jed]
That man--

10:51.920 --> 10:54.600
the one in the house
across the street.

10:54.600 --> 10:56.920
He just turned into a...

10:56.920 --> 10:58.240
A wolf.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.240
You're kidding,
right?

11:02.240 --> 11:04.760
You got me out
of bed for this?

11:04.760 --> 11:06.080
I saw him, Mom!

11:06.080 --> 11:08.600
I had my camera aimed
right at his--

11:08.600 --> 11:10.920
Jed, what is
the matter with you,

11:10.920 --> 11:12.600
spying on
that poor man?

11:12.600 --> 11:15.600
He's not a man, Mom!
Look at this.

11:18.840 --> 11:21.840
It's got to be on here.

11:21.840 --> 11:24.360
OK, Spielberg.
That's enough.

11:24.360 --> 11:26.480
Show's over.
Into bed with you.

11:26.480 --> 11:28.880
I'm not making
this up, Mom.

11:28.880 --> 11:30.880
I saw it happen.

11:30.880 --> 11:32.880
I know you did.

11:32.880 --> 11:34.880
You do?

11:34.880 --> 11:37.880
You've got dog
on the brain, honey.

11:37.880 --> 11:40.720
You're seeing them
even in your dreams.

11:40.720 --> 11:42.880
I wasn't dreaming.

11:42.880 --> 11:45.880
We'll talk about this
in the morning, OK?

11:45.880 --> 11:47.440
Good night.

11:54.440 --> 11:55.840
Good night.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.320
Night, Mom.

12:06.440 --> 12:08.040
Here it is--
werewolves.

12:08.040 --> 12:10.880
Yeah, yeah. They come out
during the full moon,

12:10.880 --> 12:13.400
and you can kill them
with silver bullets.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.200
I know how
it works, hughie.

12:15.200 --> 12:16.720
Everybody knows
how it works.

12:16.720 --> 12:18.400
What do I do about it?

12:18.400 --> 12:20.840
Wait a sec. That stuff's
all in the movies.

12:20.840 --> 12:22.840
The real werewolves
are called meso...

12:22.840 --> 12:24.320
Mesomorphs.

12:24.320 --> 12:26.640
They have a disease
that's called lyc--

12:26.640 --> 12:28.160
lycanthropy.

12:28.160 --> 12:30.160
That changes them
at any time.

12:30.160 --> 12:32.000
They're allergic
to red roses

12:32.000 --> 12:33.320
and pure silver.

12:33.320 --> 12:35.160
Great.
All we got to do

12:35.160 --> 12:37.160
is trap him
in a flower shop.

12:37.160 --> 12:38.880
There's one more thing--

12:38.880 --> 12:40.840
they need fresh meat
to survive.

12:40.840 --> 12:43.840
They eat small animals,
birds and stuff,

12:43.840 --> 12:45.920
but their favorite
is, uh...

12:48.080 --> 12:49.520
Children.

12:49.520 --> 12:51.520
Hughie, this is all
really interesting,

12:51.520 --> 12:52.960
but the question is,

12:52.960 --> 12:56.160
what do you do if you got a
werewolf living next-door?

12:56.160 --> 12:57.320
Move.

13:02.240 --> 13:04.920
[Music with a Latin beat
playing]

13:23.840 --> 13:25.640
What the heck's
going on?

13:25.640 --> 13:27.640
Where have you been? Go
get washed up quick, honey.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.360
Dinner will be ready
in a minute.

13:29.360 --> 13:30.760
We're having company?

13:30.760 --> 13:32.120
Well... yeah.

13:32.120 --> 13:34.120
Do you remember that guy
I told you about--

13:34.120 --> 13:36.080
the one I met bowling
a couple weeks ago?

13:36.080 --> 13:37.240
<i>He's coming here?</i>

13:37.240 --> 13:38.640
Mm-hmm.

13:38.640 --> 13:40.040
<i>You're having a date?</i>

13:40.040 --> 13:42.120
It's not a date.
It's just dinner.

13:42.120 --> 13:43.640
It doesn't
mean a thing.

13:43.640 --> 13:44.640
[Doorbell rings]

13:44.640 --> 13:46.320
Shoot! Door,
go get the Jed.

13:46.320 --> 13:48.640
I mean--you know
what I mean.

13:48.640 --> 13:51.040
Yeah, sure. Doesn't
mean a thing, right?

13:58.840 --> 14:00.560
You must be Jed.

14:00.560 --> 14:03.920
I just adore cooking,
as you can see.

14:03.920 --> 14:07.320
It's been so long since
I've had a man around

14:07.320 --> 14:09.200
to try my talents on.

14:09.200 --> 14:12.400
I hope you like this. It's
a recipe I got off the TV.

14:12.400 --> 14:13.800
Well,
it smells great.

14:13.800 --> 14:15.880
I'm so hungry,
I could eat a horse.

14:15.880 --> 14:18.040
Or a cat?

14:19.880 --> 14:21.080
So...

14:21.080 --> 14:23.200
How are you finding
maple street?

14:23.200 --> 14:25.600
It's great. People are
much friendlier here

14:25.600 --> 14:27.240
than the last place
I lived.

14:27.240 --> 14:29.040
Where was that--
Transylvania?

14:29.040 --> 14:31.760
Uh, actually...

14:31.760 --> 14:33.720
Seattle.

14:33.720 --> 14:36.920
Ha ha!
More yams?

14:36.920 --> 14:38.040
Ow!

14:38.040 --> 14:40.280
How do you like that, huh?
Pure silver!

14:40.280 --> 14:41.640
Jed!

14:41.640 --> 14:44.200
Watch him, Mom!
He's going to change!

14:44.200 --> 14:46.080
Jed, you apologize
right now.

14:46.080 --> 14:48.440
No, Ellen.
It's all right.

14:48.440 --> 14:49.880
No harm done.

14:49.880 --> 14:53.040
You are excused from
the table, young man.

14:53.040 --> 14:54.120

We're going out for coffee.

15:21.720 --> 15:24.040
Your dinner is
in the Kelvinator.

15:24.040 --> 15:26.720
I'll deal with you
when I get home.

Hello?

15:38.720 --> 15:40.400
Hughie,
I was wrong, man.

15:40.400 --> 15:42.560
Guess I must have been
dreaming, after all.

15:42.560 --> 15:44.240
That guy's
not a werewolf.

15:44.240 --> 15:45.720
Did you do
the tests?

15:45.720 --> 15:46.840
Yeah.

15:46.840 --> 15:48.240
Did you use pure silver?

15:48.240 --> 15:49.240
Yes.

15:49.240 --> 15:50.600
How about the moon?

15:50.600 --> 15:52.640
I did the tests,
all right?

15:52.640 --> 15:53.840
OK, OK.

15:53.840 --> 15:55.720
So your mom's boyfriend
isn't a werewolf.

15:55.720 --> 15:56.760
That's that.

15:56.760 --> 15:58.240
No, it's not.

15:58.240 --> 16:00.240
There's something
going on over there.

16:00.240 --> 16:02.840
We got to go back
in that house.

16:02.840 --> 16:05.440
Aw, Jed,
I'm taking a bath!

16:05.440 --> 16:07.400
Towel off.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.560
[Hughie]
It looks pretty quiet.

16:09.560 --> 16:11.240
Maybe we should
come back

16:11.240 --> 16:13.080
when there's
somebody home...

16:13.080 --> 16:14.560
Like noon?

16:14.560 --> 16:17.560
Come on. I know
how we can get in.

16:17.560 --> 16:18.720
Wait.

16:18.720 --> 16:20.680
Why do you keep
saying "we"?

16:20.680 --> 16:23.000
Because we're partners,
Hughie--to the end.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.520
The end?

16:24.520 --> 16:25.840
[Cat yowls]

16:25.840 --> 16:27.320
Wait for me!

16:35.240 --> 16:36.000
Oh!

16:36.760 --> 16:38.680
Will you relax?
Nobody's home.

16:38.680 --> 16:41.240
He's out having coffee
with my mom.

16:50.120 --> 16:51.800
Oh, well. That's that.

16:57.600 --> 17:00.200
Aw, man, what are you
going to do?

17:00.200 --> 17:01.440
Shh!

17:04.720 --> 17:07.359
This isn't happening.
He's not really doing this.

17:07.359 --> 17:09.640
He's not really
doing this.

17:09.640 --> 17:11.079
He really did it.

17:11.079 --> 17:12.599
Let's go.

17:20.200 --> 17:21.800
Oh, turn around.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.200
Geez!

17:24.720 --> 17:26.640
Here. Take this.

17:26.640 --> 17:28.720
Check this out.

17:34.560 --> 17:37.360
[Hughie] I thought you
said it was full of meat.

17:37.360 --> 17:40.160
It was. He must have
hidden them.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.320
Maybe he got
really hungry.

17:42.320 --> 17:43.720
[Growl]

17:43.720 --> 17:45.200
What was that?

17:53.440 --> 17:54.880
Give me that.

18:00.920 --> 18:01.920
Ohh!

18:04.880 --> 18:06.840
Can we go now?

18:06.840 --> 18:08.160
No!

18:08.160 --> 18:10.680
There's got to be
something else here--

18:10.680 --> 18:12.720
something we can
use as proof.

18:14.240 --> 18:15.320
Uh, Jed?

18:15.320 --> 18:16.480
Yeah?

18:16.480 --> 18:18.480
What does this guy
look like?

18:18.480 --> 18:20.840
I don't know--just
like an average guy.

18:20.840 --> 18:22.160
Kind of tall?

18:22.160 --> 18:23.160
Yeah.

18:23.160 --> 18:24.520
Kind of bald?

18:24.520 --> 18:26.920
Yeah. Why? What
difference does it make?

18:26.920 --> 18:29.280
Because I think he
has a twin brother!

18:29.280 --> 18:32.320
[Growling]

18:32.320 --> 18:34.520
[Boys screaming]

18:36.360 --> 18:37.520
Ah!

18:37.520 --> 18:38.680
Oh.

18:38.680 --> 18:41.080
[Growling]

18:41.080 --> 18:42.680
Aah!

18:42.680 --> 18:44.680
Go. Go. Run!

18:44.680 --> 18:46.240
Run! Come on!

18:47.480 --> 18:49.200
[Growling]

18:49.200 --> 18:50.520
Aah!
Aah!

18:50.520 --> 18:53.240
Hurry up!
It's coming!

19:07.760 --> 19:10.680
That isn't going to
hold for very long.

19:10.680 --> 19:12.680
Thanks for
the news flash.

19:12.680 --> 19:15.760
[Werewolf snarling]

19:18.760 --> 19:19.880
Ohh...

19:19.880 --> 19:22.120
Oh, man, we're
in its bedroom!

19:22.120 --> 19:24.120
[Werewolf growling]

19:24.120 --> 19:26.480
Aah!
Aah!

19:26.480 --> 19:29.080
We're trapped! He's going to
eat us! He's going to eat us!

19:30.600 --> 19:33.120
Not me, dude.
I'm nobody's lunch.

19:47.600 --> 19:48.560
Aah!
Aah!

20:01.040 --> 20:03.000
Bad dog.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.200
[Tweet]

20:04.200 --> 20:05.400
[Groaning]

20:25.160 --> 20:26.920
I see you've met Gordon.

20:26.920 --> 20:29.000
Bye, Jed!
See you at school.

20:30.680 --> 20:34.080
[Werewolf panting]

20:34.080 --> 20:35.880
Gordon?

20:37.520 --> 20:39.000
My brother.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.120
Yeah, well, I got news
for you, buddy.

20:41.120 --> 20:42.720
Your brother's
got a problem.

20:42.720 --> 20:45.120
Yeah, I know.

20:45.120 --> 20:48.120
Lycanthropy is
a terrible disease.

20:48.120 --> 20:50.440
Everybody tells me
I should just...

20:50.440 --> 20:52.440
Put him
out of his misery,

20:52.440 --> 20:53.760
but he's family.

20:53.760 --> 20:55.160
He's all I got.

20:55.160 --> 20:56.440
My mom's all I've got,

20:56.440 --> 20:58.320
and when she finds out
about this, she's--

20:58.320 --> 20:59.600
Jed...

20:59.600 --> 21:01.520
I already know.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.240
Ooh!

21:06.040 --> 21:07.840
You're not scared?

21:09.360 --> 21:10.960
I was at first,

21:10.960 --> 21:13.960
but I'm trying to
understand, honey.

21:13.960 --> 21:15.920
I hope you will, too.

21:18.200 --> 21:20.040
Does he
really eat...

21:20.040 --> 21:21.520
Kids?

21:23.120 --> 21:24.400
Rumors.

21:24.400 --> 21:26.440
People can be
so cruel.

21:27.920 --> 21:31.560
There's lots of different
kinds of families, Jed.

21:31.560 --> 21:33.640
This is just
one of them.

21:38.480 --> 21:40.800
He's got to stop eating pets.

21:42.320 --> 21:44.560
[Frank]
It wasn't long before Jed's mom

21:44.560 --> 21:46.720
married the man
from across the street.

21:46.720 --> 21:49.240
They all moved in together,
like a family.

21:49.240 --> 21:51.560
[Music with a Latin beat
playing]

21:51.560 --> 21:53.080
Looking good,
Mr. Ankers.

21:53.080 --> 21:54.560
Thank you,
Mrs. Ankers.

21:54.560 --> 21:56.560
Two well-done...

21:56.560 --> 21:58.080
Mmm!

21:58.080 --> 22:00.080
And one...

22:00.080 --> 22:01.560
Medium.

22:01.560 --> 22:03.560
[Frank]
Jed's mom was happy.

22:03.560 --> 22:05.560
The man was happy.

22:05.560 --> 22:07.800
And one very rare.

22:09.560 --> 22:13.160
Jed, Gordon--
dinnertime.

22:15.160 --> 22:16.760
OK. Go back--way back.

22:16.760 --> 22:18.760
This one's
out of the park.

22:18.760 --> 22:20.480
[Frank]
And as for Jed...

22:22.560 --> 22:25.040
He finally got his dog.

22:25.040 --> 22:26.600
[Howling]

22:28.240 --> 22:29.600
The end.

22:33.080 --> 22:34.520
And now...

22:34.520 --> 22:37.520
Our anniversary surprise.

22:37.520 --> 22:38.680
Surprise?

22:38.680 --> 22:41.280
Fire's nice and hot.

22:41.280 --> 22:42.720
What surprise?

22:42.720 --> 22:44.040
Special
occasion--

22:44.040 --> 22:46.120
we planned it
just for you.

22:46.120 --> 22:48.040
Roast...

22:48.040 --> 22:49.520
Frank.

22:49.520 --> 22:51.520
Say what?

22:51.520 --> 22:53.720
Roast Franks.
Don't you like them?

22:53.720 --> 22:55.760
Ha! Oh, yeah.
They're great.

22:55.760 --> 22:57.520
Happy Anniversary, Frank.

22:57.520 --> 22:58.920
Let's cook.

23:00.160 --> 23:01.200
Ohh!

23:01.200 --> 23:03.040
So, who brought
the buns?

23:03.040 --> 23:06.040
Oh, you were supposed
to bring the buns.

23:06.040 --> 23:07.560
Way to go.
