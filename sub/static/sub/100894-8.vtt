[Maddie] What the hell were you thinking?

01:09.736 --> 01:12.238
[Bill] Hey, don't take that tone
with me now, all right?

01:12.864 --> 01:14.574
Tyler's 16, he's a good kid,

01:14.657 --> 01:17.077
-so if I want to buy my son a car--
-Our son!

01:17.160 --> 01:18.953
He is our son, Bill.

01:19.037 --> 01:21.706
You are not allowed to make decisions
like this without consulting me.

01:21.790 --> 01:23.416
We are co-parenting, remember?

01:23.500 --> 01:24.918
Oh, please, you don't want to co-parent,

01:25.001 --> 01:26.795
you don't want me to have a say
in anything.

01:26.878 --> 01:28.922
You just want me to submit
all of my plans to you

01:29.005 --> 01:30.090
ahead of time for approval.

01:30.173 --> 01:32.675
No, Bill, I want you to respect me.

01:33.259 --> 01:35.220
[Bill] So I have no say in anything.

01:35.637 --> 01:37.555
[Maddie] Do not put words in my mouth.

01:37.972 --> 01:40.767
[Bill] You're saying the only way
I can be right is to agree with you.

01:40.850 --> 01:42.268
[Maddie] I'm asking you to work with me.

01:42.352 --> 01:44.270
-I can't believe Dad did this.
-[Maddie] Not against me.

01:44.354 --> 01:47.273
Wait, are you actually complaining
because Dad bought you a car?

01:47.357 --> 01:49.109
He's trying to get a one-up on Mom.

01:49.192 --> 01:51.820
You think he would have shown up
in front of half the town otherwise?

01:52.445 --> 01:54.405
He's trying to make himself look good,
as usual.

01:55.490 --> 01:56.825
He's hurting Mom as usual.

01:57.659 --> 01:59.911
If you're so worried about Mom,
tell Dad you don't want it.

02:00.787 --> 02:02.247
Why does it even matter to you?

02:02.747 --> 02:05.416
Moan all you want,
but you're cool with Dad fawning on you.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.961
Coming to all your games,
taking you to see the Braves every summer,

02:08.044 --> 02:09.462
bragging on you nonstop.

02:10.338 --> 02:13.049
You whine, but you're just fine
with him always being there...

02:13.466 --> 02:14.300
for you.

02:15.927 --> 02:17.053
Don't go in there.

02:17.554 --> 02:18.680
Dad won't even see me.

02:20.098 --> 02:22.100
You know what your problem is, Maddie?

02:22.600 --> 02:24.060
Who's driving us to school?

02:24.727 --> 02:25.895
You're walking today.

02:34.946 --> 02:36.156
[dishes clanging]

02:40.285 --> 02:41.411
[phone chiming]

02:42.287 --> 02:44.289
One of the conditions
of my returning your phone

02:44.372 --> 02:46.624
is that you would refrain from using it
at the table.

02:46.708 --> 02:49.335
Since when do we do
sit-down breakfast anyway?

02:49.419 --> 02:50.920
Well, we used to.

02:51.963 --> 02:53.715
When I was, like, eight.

02:53.798 --> 02:56.509
We haven't had enough time together
to talk,

02:56.593 --> 03:00.597
so we are going to do family breakfast
from now on,

03:00.680 --> 03:04.475
and you are going to tell me
about what is important in your life.

03:04.893 --> 03:08.897
One of the most important things
in my life right now is mock trial, so...

03:10.273 --> 03:12.483
You don't want me
to keep Aunt Helen waiting, do you?

03:16.070 --> 03:17.113
Have a good day.

03:17.530 --> 03:18.615
[door opens]

03:20.909 --> 03:22.076
[door closes]

03:25.914 --> 03:28.625
[Helen]
<i>Simon, you can be a little sharper.</i>

03:28.708 --> 03:30.793
Don't be afraid to be a bulldog, yeah?

03:30.877 --> 03:35.381
And, Kyle, can we tone down
the Atticus Finch just a little bit?

03:35.465 --> 03:36.883
[Helen chuckles]

03:36.966 --> 03:39.219
All right, a little reminder
on the dress code.

03:39.302 --> 03:41.179
This is business attire,

03:41.262 --> 03:45.016
so slacks, knee-length skirts,
Sunday suits.

03:45.099 --> 03:48.436
If you will not wear it in front
of your grandmama's church friends,

03:48.519 --> 03:50.730
I do not want to see it in the courtroom.

03:51.147 --> 03:52.899
Okay. Wonderful.

03:52.982 --> 03:55.276
-I'll see y'all on Thursday. Yeah.
-[bell ringing]

03:55.693 --> 03:57.362
CeCe, can I have a moment?

04:02.408 --> 04:06.079
Oh. I'm sorry. Here, let me help you.

04:06.162 --> 04:07.121
Thank you.

04:10.583 --> 04:13.002
-What did I do wrong?
-[Helen] Oh, nothing. Nothing at all.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.588
I just wanted to talk to you
about your trial outfit.

04:15.672 --> 04:17.674
-What about it?
-Well, I don't expect

04:17.757 --> 04:20.927
there are many teenage girls
who have a power suit in their wardrobe.

04:21.344 --> 04:23.471
Yeah, no, not really my thing.

04:23.554 --> 04:27.517
Well, there's a very cool consignment shop
in Castlewood, you should check it out.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.602
I go there all the time. Crazy cheap.

04:30.144 --> 04:32.855
And a good suit
will last you into college, at least.

04:33.314 --> 04:35.108
-I'll check it out.
-Good.

04:36.567 --> 04:38.486
Wouldn't have pegged CeCe
for a teacher's pet.

04:39.028 --> 04:41.197
Yeah, if Aunt Helen wants a snake
for a pet.

04:45.243 --> 04:46.452
Good morning, Chef.

04:47.036 --> 04:49.289
Uh, well, no, a good morning would be one

04:49.372 --> 04:52.500
where I was gifted with the superpower
of understanding teenagers.

04:52.583 --> 04:53.918
[Erik laughs]

04:54.002 --> 04:55.295
Can I make you some breakfast?

04:55.378 --> 04:58.214
Oh, see, I made a fantastic breakfast.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.675
Healthy, filling, perfectly plated.

05:01.134 --> 05:04.512
Other kids would have wept
over these pancakes alone.

05:04.595 --> 05:05.847
Annie can't be bothered.

05:06.556 --> 05:07.890
And how much did you eat?

05:07.974 --> 05:10.476
Uh... [stammers] ...I lost my appetite.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.937
How lucky you work
in a fully stocked kitchen, then.

05:13.438 --> 05:15.648
You are a complete mother hen.

05:15.732 --> 05:16.774
[Erik chuckles]

05:18.026 --> 05:20.778
Has Dr. Howie talked to you
about mindfulness?

05:21.195 --> 05:24.532
Yeah. I'm just not the meditating type.

05:24.907 --> 05:27.952
Kinda shocked
that I had to point that out.

05:28.036 --> 05:31.164
I-- I'm talking about taking stock
of how you feel,

05:31.748 --> 05:32.790
of what you feel.

05:33.958 --> 05:35.626
There's more than one way to do this.

05:36.044 --> 05:39.213
Meet me here first thing tomorrow morning,
and I'll show you.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.134
-All right.
-All right?

05:43.217 --> 05:44.927
-Better be there.
-I will be there.

05:45.011 --> 05:46.054
[Erik laughs] All right.

05:46.137 --> 05:48.222
Better show me something
worth being there for.

05:48.306 --> 05:49.599
[laughing]

05:51.642 --> 05:52.727
[Neville sighs]

05:55.229 --> 05:56.439
Thank you for coming.

05:56.522 --> 05:57.440
[Helen] Aw.

05:58.983 --> 06:01.027
-I know you're busy.
-Neville,

06:01.110 --> 06:03.905
I will never miss a chance
to visit with you.

06:04.864 --> 06:05.698
[sighs]

06:05.782 --> 06:06.824
What's on your mind?

06:06.908 --> 06:10.870
Well, it seems
I have come into a large hunk of property.

06:10.953 --> 06:13.456
-Oh.
-And I don't know what all else.

06:14.415 --> 06:16.584
My cousin Benji passed away
the other week.

06:16.667 --> 06:19.462
Oh, I forgot you two were kin.
My condolences.

06:19.545 --> 06:20.588
Thank you. Uh...

06:21.339 --> 06:23.966
Old Benji didn't like many people.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.677
He didn't like much of anything
outside the farm,

06:27.220 --> 06:28.346
which he left to me.

06:29.263 --> 06:33.142
And I'm grateful,
but I just don't know what to do with it.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.269
I don't want to work it, clearly, and...

06:35.812 --> 06:37.939
Well, I just can't bring myself
to sell it.

06:38.606 --> 06:41.401
This land has been in the family
for generations.

06:41.984 --> 06:43.986
None of your children are interested?

06:44.070 --> 06:46.197
Oh, none of them know a tractor
from a teacup.

06:46.280 --> 06:47.407
[Helen laughs]

06:47.490 --> 06:51.786
And that's fine, they're on good paths,
just distant ones.

06:51.869 --> 06:54.831
You and Miss Grace
raised beautiful people.

06:54.914 --> 06:57.250
Well, they are gifts, to be sure.

06:58.334 --> 06:59.293
Anyway,

07:00.253 --> 07:03.840
you handled matters so well
for Frances's house,

07:04.632 --> 07:07.844
I was hoping maybe you could do
something similar with this.

07:08.553 --> 07:11.097
You know, keep the legacy goin'...

07:11.764 --> 07:13.641
-Benji would like that...
-[Helen chuckles]

07:13.724 --> 07:15.518
...as much as Benji liked anything.

07:18.229 --> 07:19.313
Let me see what I can do.

07:19.814 --> 07:20.648
Thank you.

07:26.737 --> 07:27.989
[door opens]

07:31.742 --> 07:32.785
[door closes]

07:33.411 --> 07:35.204
[Cal] Can I book a one-on-one with you?

07:36.122 --> 07:37.081
Hmm.

07:37.623 --> 07:38.749
How's your day goin'?

07:39.250 --> 07:40.334
[both chuckle]

07:44.338 --> 07:45.631
I'm crunching numbers.

07:46.174 --> 07:49.343
I need to get an assistant
so I am not chained to this desk,

07:49.427 --> 07:52.305
but membership
is just not growing fast enough.

07:52.388 --> 07:53.848
Well, I have a problem too.

07:53.931 --> 07:56.309
Though it's small in comparison,

07:57.393 --> 07:59.312
it's about our date Saturday night.

08:01.606 --> 08:03.900
Salmon or steak, I can't decide.

08:03.983 --> 08:05.151
[laughs]

08:06.027 --> 08:08.446
God call me home
the day I say no to a steak.

08:09.155 --> 08:10.114
Medium rare.

08:11.115 --> 08:12.575
-Yes, ma'am.
-[chuckles]

08:13.534 --> 08:15.786
Any other instructions
you would like to give me?

08:18.956 --> 08:19.916
[clears throat]

08:20.333 --> 08:21.334
Mmm.

08:22.668 --> 08:23.669
[Cal clears throat]

08:29.258 --> 08:30.259
[exhales]

08:32.553 --> 08:33.596
[Bill] All right.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.640
There you go with some tea.

08:35.973 --> 08:36.933
Thank you.

08:37.016 --> 08:37.934
[Bill sighs]

08:38.017 --> 08:39.894
What are you doing? Shopping again?

08:39.977 --> 08:43.773
Mama's been on me about doing
my wedding/baby registry.

08:43.856 --> 08:48.194
Well, I wouldn't worry
about all that baby stuff too much.

08:48.277 --> 08:50.655
You know,
Katie's stuff is still in good shape.

08:50.738 --> 08:52.240
She's six.

08:52.323 --> 08:54.700
Standards have changed
in the last few years.

08:54.784 --> 08:57.286
You're a pediatrician. Isn't knowing that
kind of your job, honey?

08:57.370 --> 08:59.872
[laughs] Yes, it is,

08:59.956 --> 09:03.042
and I take safety standards
very seriously,

09:03.125 --> 09:05.628
but I've also been a dad three times,

09:05.711 --> 09:08.005
so I know all the stuff they shove at you.

09:08.089 --> 09:11.008
[chuckles] They tell you
your child's gonna be a failure

09:11.092 --> 09:16.264
if he doesn't get that 300-dollar mobile
and God knows what else.

09:16.347 --> 09:17.223
Oh...

09:17.306 --> 09:20.142
Trust me, those first couple of months,

09:20.601 --> 09:22.770
we're gonna need a lot less
than you think.

09:23.187 --> 09:27.233
Well, we're at least gonna need a car seat
to get this one home from the hospital,

09:27.316 --> 09:30.486
or were you planning on strapping our baby
to the hood of our car?

09:30.570 --> 09:31.821
[chuckles]

09:31.904 --> 09:33.030
Look at this car seat.

09:33.990 --> 09:37.159
Highest safety ratings,
it will fit in both of our cars.

09:37.243 --> 09:38.369
[Bill sighs]

09:41.497 --> 09:43.082
Little expensive, isn't it?

09:45.418 --> 09:46.419
Oh, so...

09:47.420 --> 09:50.047
you can buy Tyler a brand-new car,

09:50.506 --> 09:52.842
but our child can't even get a car seat?

09:52.925 --> 09:57.430
Tyler and his new car have nothing
to do with you and our baby, okay?

09:57.513 --> 10:00.057
They do when you tell me
that we can't afford a decent car seat

10:00.141 --> 10:01.517
or my dream house,

10:01.976 --> 10:04.895
but you can go spend
heaven knows how much on Tyler's car.

10:04.979 --> 10:07.189
-Please calm down.
-No. No!

10:07.273 --> 10:09.150
You said
you wanted to build a life with me.

10:09.233 --> 10:10.776
You left your wife for me.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.612
[scoffs]
Forgive me for thinking that meant

10:12.695 --> 10:15.156
you were going to <i>finally </i>put me first.

10:22.830 --> 10:24.332
I gotta go meet your brother.

10:33.883 --> 10:34.884
[groans]

10:38.179 --> 10:39.180
[button clicks]

10:41.515 --> 10:42.350
[sighs]

10:42.433 --> 10:44.435
[Maddie]
Your dad and I will cover insurance

10:44.518 --> 10:46.437
until you're 18 and then you'll pay.

10:46.520 --> 10:49.732
Gas and basic maintenance is on you.

10:49.815 --> 10:53.736
You can only drive to school, to practice,
and to pick up your siblings.

10:54.654 --> 10:55.738
And at no point

10:55.821 --> 10:59.492
will you have anyone in your car
whose last name is not Townsend.

10:59.575 --> 11:04.080
So, I can't take the guys around or Cece.
What's the point of having a car then?

11:04.163 --> 11:07.333
The car is a responsibility,
and you need to show me you can handle it.

11:08.167 --> 11:10.294
Keep your nose clean,
and we'll revisit it.

11:10.378 --> 11:11.879
Until then, those are the rules.

11:11.962 --> 11:14.298
I get that you're mad at Dad,
but why are you punishing me?

11:17.760 --> 11:18.594
Uh...

11:23.140 --> 11:25.101
-I'm really sorry.
-Yeah.

11:28.646 --> 11:29.522
[Bill] Thank you.

11:29.897 --> 11:30.815
[Garth] Thanks.

11:32.024 --> 11:33.192
[Bill] You don't drink?

11:33.651 --> 11:34.485
I can't.

11:34.985 --> 11:36.737
I don't turn 21 till next month.

11:37.488 --> 11:39.824
Well, I probably should have known that.

11:39.907 --> 11:40.908
[both chuckle]

11:41.659 --> 11:43.327
I'm sorry, it's just, uh...

11:43.994 --> 11:48.416
Well, Noreen and I haven't had much
of a chance to talk about y'all's family.

11:49.333 --> 11:50.292
So, uh...

11:51.127 --> 11:53.295
Well, it's real nice
to get to meet you now.

11:54.088 --> 11:56.340
I'm looking forward
to meeting everybody else.

11:56.882 --> 11:57.925
Really?

11:58.008 --> 11:59.260
Well, yeah.

11:59.343 --> 12:02.847
It just seems right
with her and I making a life together

12:02.930 --> 12:04.682
that I get to know y'all.

12:05.766 --> 12:07.393
You got your work cut out for you
with Dad.

12:08.769 --> 12:10.646
Mom will come around easier, though.

12:11.063 --> 12:13.232
Only thing we want for her
and for that baby

12:13.691 --> 12:14.859
is for them to be happy.

12:15.943 --> 12:17.695
Well, we're on the same page, then,

12:18.404 --> 12:20.239
'cause that's all I want for her too.

12:21.282 --> 12:22.283
Make her happy.

12:30.791 --> 12:34.962
Well, this isn't quite what I pictured
when you said mindfulness.

12:35.379 --> 12:37.590
[both laugh]

12:38.507 --> 12:40.843
[Erik] There was some people
I was talking to the other day.

12:40.926 --> 12:41.761
[Dana Sue] Mm-hmm.

12:41.844 --> 12:45.681
[Erik] They reminded me
that stillness comes in many forms,

12:46.891 --> 12:50.102
but you have to give yourself permission
and forgiveness to find it.

12:55.524 --> 12:57.902
[Dana Sue] You know,
I haven't been fishing since...

12:58.486 --> 13:00.112
since my daddy died.

13:01.947 --> 13:03.282
He started bringing me out here

13:03.365 --> 13:06.494
as soon as I was old enough
to bait a hook.

13:10.706 --> 13:12.500
I didn't realize how much I missed it.

13:13.918 --> 13:15.085
You miss him?

13:16.128 --> 13:18.130
Oh, yeah. Every day.

13:20.174 --> 13:21.592
He was my hero,

13:22.927 --> 13:26.222
and I told him... everything.

13:26.931 --> 13:30.893
No matter how busy he got,
he always had time for me.

13:34.438 --> 13:37.650
Well, I mean, for anyone who needed him.

13:40.319 --> 13:42.738
I wanted to be just like him.

13:47.243 --> 13:50.246
You know, I told you before
that you're a good boss.

13:51.956 --> 13:53.457
But what I haven't told you...

13:54.542 --> 13:55.835
is you're a good friend.

13:57.628 --> 13:59.088
When I came to Sullivan's...

14:00.297 --> 14:01.382
I was at...

14:04.134 --> 14:06.178
one of the lowest points in my life.

14:09.598 --> 14:12.768
What brought you so low,
if you don't mind my asking?

14:16.939 --> 14:18.023
My wife died.

14:19.024 --> 14:19.859
Oh.

14:20.568 --> 14:21.485
It was sudden.

14:22.444 --> 14:25.030
There was absolutely nothing
I could do to help...

14:27.658 --> 14:30.995
even though I believed
I should be able to.

14:33.038 --> 14:34.498
It stripped me to my bones.

14:35.666 --> 14:38.544
I felt completely out of control.

14:42.381 --> 14:44.091
It's why I went to culinary school...

14:45.843 --> 14:47.136
and came to Sullivan's:

14:47.720 --> 14:49.722
to find a place with order...

14:51.265 --> 14:52.224
that made sense.

14:54.059 --> 14:55.185
I'm so sorry.

14:56.562 --> 14:58.564
[Erik] No, no. I-- I'm the sorry one.

14:58.981 --> 15:01.942
I brought you out here
to talk about your problems, not mine.

15:02.026 --> 15:04.236
[Dana Sue chuckles]
No, don't you dare apologize.

15:04.820 --> 15:08.032
This-- This-- This whole friendship thing,

15:08.699 --> 15:10.034
this is a two-way street.

15:12.703 --> 15:13.537
Thank you...

15:14.747 --> 15:15.789
for sharing.

15:18.751 --> 15:19.585
[chuckles]

15:22.671 --> 15:24.757
[Kyle] You're coming to the play, right?

15:24.840 --> 15:26.008
[Annie] Wrong. I'm grounded

15:26.091 --> 15:28.719
until a couple of weeks past eternity,
remember?

15:28.802 --> 15:31.764
But this is a school thing.
It's educational. Convince your mom!

15:32.264 --> 15:33.891
It's really that important to you?

15:37.227 --> 15:39.271
Love takes the meaning
in love's confidence.

15:39.355 --> 15:41.231
I mean that my heart unto yours is knit

15:41.315 --> 15:43.400
so that but one heart we may make of it.

15:44.276 --> 15:45.235
That's pretty!

15:45.736 --> 15:47.780
Well, they're actually Lysander's lines,

15:47.863 --> 15:49.323
but they're also...

15:50.991 --> 15:52.993
a really great example
of iambic pentameter.

15:53.077 --> 15:55.371
You can just tell your mom
it's important for English class.

15:55.454 --> 15:57.957
I'll talk to her.
Maybe she'll say yes 'cause it's you.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.041
We'll see.

16:03.045 --> 16:03.879
[Annie] Hey.

16:04.296 --> 16:05.172
-Hey, Annie.
-Hey.

16:08.717 --> 16:10.552
[Bill] Thank you. We'll be in touch.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.606
New pharma rep going around?

16:23.065 --> 16:26.568
No, she was interviewing
to be your replacement.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.781
You mean temp nurse, right?
For when I start maternity leave?

16:30.864 --> 16:34.034
Oh, I just assumed that
after you'd had the baby, you'd stay home.

16:35.202 --> 16:38.664
I am, for 12 weeks of maternity leave,
and then I'm coming back.

16:39.164 --> 16:42.209
Okay, all right.
How was I supposed to know that?

16:42.793 --> 16:45.004
Because I never said I was quitting,
for one.

16:45.504 --> 16:48.257
You don't think I'd say something
if I was planning to stay home?

16:48.340 --> 16:50.968
Noreen. All right. All right.

16:51.051 --> 16:54.054
I just figured you would, okay?
I mean, that's what...

16:56.432 --> 16:58.892
[scoffs]
I'm sorry to disappoint you, Bill.

16:59.393 --> 17:00.602
I'm not Maddie.

17:07.109 --> 17:08.360
[doorbell rings]

17:09.945 --> 17:10.946
[sighs]

17:12.531 --> 17:13.741
-Hi.
-Hi.

17:13.824 --> 17:14.950
[chuckles]

17:15.409 --> 17:18.537
Don't take this the wrong way,
but what are you doing here?

17:19.329 --> 17:20.414
Thought I could help.

17:20.914 --> 17:23.083
I was at Morton's
when Miss Grace took your order.

17:23.167 --> 17:24.877
I offered to deliver
since it was on my way.

17:24.960 --> 17:27.838
-Extra pepperoni if you're, um--
-[Katie] I need a knife!

17:28.714 --> 17:31.592
Please. Come in. If you dare.

17:32.092 --> 17:33.010
Ah.

17:37.765 --> 17:39.099
These aren't sharp enough.

17:39.183 --> 17:42.394
Okay. Oh! Yeah, you know what?
Why don't we take a break, sweetie?

17:42.478 --> 17:44.063
Coach Cal came to see us.

17:44.146 --> 17:45.105
He brought pizza.

17:45.189 --> 17:46.857
-Pepperoni?
-Extra.

17:48.525 --> 17:50.360
Do you know anything about dinosaurs?

17:50.444 --> 17:51.820
[Cal] What kind of dinosaurs?

17:51.904 --> 17:53.072
Liopleurodons.

17:53.155 --> 17:54.364
[Cal] Nope. No idea.

17:56.283 --> 17:57.326
[Katie laughs]

18:00.537 --> 18:02.873
[Cal speaking indistinctly]

18:02.956 --> 18:03.916
-Katie?
-[Katie growling]

18:03.999 --> 18:05.584
[Cal laughing]

18:07.044 --> 18:09.171
-[Katie] Down here.
-[Maddie] What in heaven's name?

18:09.254 --> 18:11.381
Uh... I'm a swimming dinosaur.

18:11.465 --> 18:12.466
[laughs]

18:12.966 --> 18:15.302
[chokes] Have mercy, Miss Katie!

18:15.719 --> 18:16.762
[Cal laughs]

18:16.845 --> 18:20.057
I've got big teeth
so I can eat all the other dinosaurs, Mom.

18:20.432 --> 18:23.811
Wait, is that why you wanted to cut up
all those dinosaurs in your diorama?

18:23.894 --> 18:24.853
Because they're food?

18:24.937 --> 18:26.146
Of course.

18:26.230 --> 18:27.981
[Maddie]
Okay, well, we'll take care of that,

18:28.065 --> 18:30.818
but for right now, my little carnivore,
it's time for some real food.

18:30.901 --> 18:32.194
-Come here!
-[Katie giggles]

18:32.277 --> 18:33.278
[Cal grunts]

18:33.946 --> 18:35.364
-Coach Cal?
-Yeah?

18:35.447 --> 18:37.825
Are you going to stay
and help with my dinosaurs?

18:38.242 --> 18:40.494
Can I, Miss Katie? Sounds like fun.

18:40.577 --> 18:42.412
[Katie laughs]

18:43.372 --> 18:44.915
Come here, I'm gonna eat you!

18:50.546 --> 18:52.464
[Dana Sue] Yes, you are right,

18:52.548 --> 18:55.008
Kyle's play has educational value,

18:55.509 --> 18:56.677
so you may go.

18:56.760 --> 18:57.719
Mom, thank you so--

18:57.803 --> 19:00.931
But you are going with the Townsends

19:01.014 --> 19:04.726
and this is just because
it is Shakespeare and Kyle.

19:05.185 --> 19:06.728
Yes, ma'am. Thank you.

19:06.812 --> 19:07.855
You're welcome.

19:13.360 --> 19:14.820
You're not gonna make me talk?

19:15.237 --> 19:17.948
Tell you my deep, dark, teenage secrets?

19:19.950 --> 19:20.784
Well...

19:22.244 --> 19:24.037
will that help you achieve inner peace?

19:24.454 --> 19:25.831
What? [laughs]

19:27.875 --> 19:30.127
We can talk about anything you want.

19:36.300 --> 19:38.844
Seriously,
thanks for letting me go to the play.

19:39.219 --> 19:41.263
Kyle's been talking about it nonstop.

19:41.346 --> 19:43.265
-Oh, has he?
-Yeah.

19:44.016 --> 19:46.602
He was quoting it
on the way to school the other day.

19:46.685 --> 19:49.313
I, like, both wish I were that obsessed
with anything

19:49.396 --> 19:52.191
and kinda feel like he could take it down
half a notch, you know?

19:52.274 --> 19:53.358
[laughs]

19:53.442 --> 19:55.360
Yeah. Makes sense.

19:57.362 --> 19:58.655
I was hoping that this will count

19:58.739 --> 20:00.699
for one
of my cultural events bonus credits

20:00.782 --> 20:01.992
-for English class...
-Mm-hmm.

20:02.576 --> 20:04.870
...because frankly,
I could use a point or two.

20:04.953 --> 20:06.705
[Dana Sue laughs]

20:16.423 --> 20:17.299
Dad?

20:17.716 --> 20:19.051
Oh, hey, Kyle.

20:20.010 --> 20:21.178
School out already?

20:21.553 --> 20:22.638
What are you doing here?

20:22.721 --> 20:25.641
Oh, I'm just going through
some of this stuff,

20:26.141 --> 20:28.477
trying to find some things
for the new little one.

20:30.229 --> 20:31.230
Need some help?

20:31.813 --> 20:34.066
Well, that'd be great. Thanks.

20:34.149 --> 20:36.526
Why don't you get down on that one,
see what we got?

20:40.197 --> 20:41.198
[chuckles]

20:41.615 --> 20:42.741
Do you need a monitor?

20:43.492 --> 20:45.869
Actually, we do.

20:45.953 --> 20:48.372
[chuckles]
Yeah, these things are surprisingly handy.

20:52.292 --> 20:54.920
So how are you doing, son?
Keeping those grades up?

20:55.003 --> 20:55.921
They're fine,

20:56.672 --> 20:58.715
and I handled the tickets this afternoon.

20:58.799 --> 21:01.260
Yours and Noreen's will be waiting for you
at will call.

21:01.760 --> 21:05.055
Oh, your play,
that's coming up, that's right.

21:05.472 --> 21:07.933
-Tell me the name of your character again.
-Puck.

21:09.017 --> 21:11.436
He's one of the most important characters
of Shakespeare.

21:11.853 --> 21:13.021
Well, that's terrific.

21:15.857 --> 21:19.486
It's the theater version
of being picked for varsity.

21:21.738 --> 21:25.158
All right. That's terrific.
I'm proud of you, son.

21:25.242 --> 21:26.702
Looking forward to seeing it.

21:28.245 --> 21:29.663
[Maddie] What's going on here?

21:31.331 --> 21:32.416
Oh, hey, Maddie.

21:33.083 --> 21:35.711
I thought I'd take some of this stuff
off your hands.

21:37.754 --> 21:38.880
Kyle, go inside, please.

21:39.381 --> 21:40.340
Yes, ma'am.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.468
-Bye, Dad.
-All right.

21:44.219 --> 21:45.637
Thanks for the help, bud.

21:47.723 --> 21:51.059
Well, I see that you still have
a copy of the garage key.

21:51.435 --> 21:52.352
I'll take that.

21:57.441 --> 21:58.650
Okay.

22:00.610 --> 22:02.654
Hey, listen,
I'm sorry about all this mess.

22:02.738 --> 22:04.656
I didn't know
that you rearranged in there.

22:04.740 --> 22:06.742
It's 'cause it's not your house anymore.

22:08.118 --> 22:10.412
How did you think that this would be okay?

22:11.038 --> 22:12.539
Well, I don't know, I just...

22:13.498 --> 22:15.667
Well, come on,
I just figured nobody in this house

22:15.751 --> 22:17.002
needs this stuff anymore,

22:17.085 --> 22:19.171
so why doesn't the baby
get the benefit, right?

22:19.254 --> 22:21.548
I mean,
I paid for most of this stuff anyways.

22:21.631 --> 22:24.968
It's not... about the money, Bill.

22:26.720 --> 22:30.557
It's about the fact that
you didn't even take into consideration

22:30.640 --> 22:33.185
how I would feel
about you coming into my house

22:33.268 --> 22:35.354
and taking my children's things

22:35.437 --> 22:39.358
for the woman that you were screwing
while we were still married.

22:39.441 --> 22:40.525
All right, look...

22:41.151 --> 22:42.027
I'm sorry.

22:42.652 --> 22:44.321
-Are you?
-Yes.

22:44.780 --> 22:45.822
[scoffs]

22:46.615 --> 22:47.741
I don't think you are,

22:48.367 --> 22:51.286
because you never take
anyone else's feelings into consideration.

22:51.370 --> 22:52.662
You never ask.

22:53.538 --> 22:55.082
You just do what you want

22:55.165 --> 22:57.584
and then you leave the rest of us
to deal with the damage.

22:57.667 --> 23:00.128
Hey, that's not fair
and completely untrue.

23:00.212 --> 23:02.172
You didn't ask when you came into here.

23:02.255 --> 23:05.759
You didn't ask
before you bought Ty a new car,

23:05.842 --> 23:08.595
and you certainly didn't ask
before you blew up our marriage.

23:08.678 --> 23:11.681
Hey! I worked hard for this family.
I sacrificed--

23:11.765 --> 23:13.767
That's what parenting is, Bill!

23:15.227 --> 23:17.187
That's also what marriage is all about.

23:17.729 --> 23:20.440
It's about sacrifice and giving.

23:22.442 --> 23:24.069
It's also supposed to be a two-way street,

23:24.152 --> 23:26.446
but... but you just take.

23:27.656 --> 23:30.367
[sighs]
Hell, you took 20 years of my life,

23:30.450 --> 23:32.577
what's a few kids' things along the way?

23:34.538 --> 23:35.622
Just tell me, Bill...

23:36.748 --> 23:38.583
did you finally get what you wanted?

24:00.105 --> 24:01.022
You're not Isaac.

24:01.481 --> 24:02.899
Well, thanks for noticing.

24:02.983 --> 24:04.317
[Helen chuckles] Why are you here?

24:04.401 --> 24:07.446
[chuckles] I'm stocking
for the after-work workout crowd.

24:07.529 --> 24:09.865
You never leave your kitchen
this close to dinner.

24:09.948 --> 24:13.535
Well, Isaac and Erik
have it under control,

24:13.618 --> 24:14.870
and I should be here more often,

24:14.953 --> 24:17.581
not leaving Maddie feeling
like she's doing this all alone.

24:19.124 --> 24:20.542
You're a pod person.

24:20.625 --> 24:21.793
Oh, hush!

24:21.877 --> 24:25.172
[laughs] Oh, here, look,
I want you to try something.

24:26.006 --> 24:27.424
[humming]

24:28.049 --> 24:30.802
Uh, let me get you a good one.
Here you go.

24:36.433 --> 24:37.642
That strawberry is perfect.

24:37.726 --> 24:39.394
[Dana Sue] I know, I know,

24:39.478 --> 24:42.147
and enjoy it while you can,
my vendor died.

24:42.230 --> 24:44.774
It's gonna be a heck of a time
trying to replace him.

24:47.194 --> 24:51.156
Your vendor wouldn't have been
Benji Hayes, by any chance, huh?

24:51.907 --> 24:53.533
How the heck do you know that?

24:54.743 --> 24:56.745
Oh. Oh, oh, oh.

24:57.329 --> 24:59.080
Are you handling his estate?

24:59.164 --> 25:00.207
Dana Sue.

25:00.290 --> 25:03.627
[chuckles] Okay. I-- I know.
Attorney-client privilege.

25:03.710 --> 25:06.630
-[chuckles] Thanks.
-Even if the guy's dead.

25:06.713 --> 25:08.215
Dana Sue!

25:08.715 --> 25:09.841
I don't even want to know.

25:09.925 --> 25:11.885
Don't tell me. [chuckles]

25:11.968 --> 25:14.971
-All right, let me pose a hypothetical.
-Okay.

25:15.055 --> 25:17.307
If a certain individual

25:17.390 --> 25:20.560
was sustaining the co-op with
his own money for the past few years--

25:20.644 --> 25:21.520
Oh, that dear man.

25:22.938 --> 25:25.774
Oh, that dear hypothetical man.

25:25.857 --> 25:27.651
Better. [chuckles]

25:27.734 --> 25:30.904
And that source of funding went away.

25:31.321 --> 25:34.241
Because he went away. God rest his soul.

25:34.324 --> 25:36.368
Would that impact you significantly?

25:36.451 --> 25:40.497
Uh, me, the farmer's market,
several other restaurants.

25:41.122 --> 25:43.583
See, if Benji didn't have it,
he knew who did.

25:44.084 --> 25:47.170
His prices were fair,
his produce was divine.

25:47.837 --> 25:49.756
I mean, the co-op's still running so far,

25:49.839 --> 25:53.552
but rumor has it that nobody knows
who's going to take over his land,

25:53.635 --> 25:56.179
so the real estate developers
are just circling.

25:57.472 --> 25:58.974
The end of an era.

26:05.272 --> 26:06.147
Can I help you?

26:09.317 --> 26:12.112
[stammers] I'm looking for Noreen?

26:12.195 --> 26:13.363
[chuckles]

26:13.488 --> 26:14.447
I bet you're Kyle.

26:14.531 --> 26:15.532
Dude, come on in.

26:16.366 --> 26:18.285
I'm Garth, Noreen's brother.

26:18.368 --> 26:19.744
Neen, you got company.

26:20.161 --> 26:22.706
Congrats on your play, man,
Noreen was telling me all about it.

26:23.123 --> 26:24.624
-She has?
-Oh, yeah, I mean,

26:24.708 --> 26:27.002
she can't stop bragging
about her awesome stepkids.

26:27.460 --> 26:29.045
Hey, kiddo. What brings you here?

26:29.129 --> 26:31.756
I'mma leave you all to it.
You need anything from the store?

26:31.840 --> 26:34.134
Um, uh, Vienna sausages if you don't mind.

26:34.926 --> 26:36.761
-Cravings are weird.
-[boys laugh]

26:36.845 --> 26:38.138
Nice to meet you, Kyle.

26:38.638 --> 26:39.889
Come on, sit down.

26:43.226 --> 26:45.312
Noreen, I came to give you this.

26:45.979 --> 26:47.731
And who is this?

26:47.814 --> 26:48.857
His name is Legs.

26:49.649 --> 26:51.901
When I was little, I took him everywhere.

26:51.985 --> 26:53.278
He was my best friend

26:53.862 --> 26:56.281
and I thought
the baby could use a friend like that.

26:56.364 --> 26:59.284
My goodness, Kyle,
that is just the sweetest thing.

27:00.368 --> 27:03.330
You know, you are probably one
of the most caring people I have ever met.

27:03.747 --> 27:06.124
You're gonna make some girl
real lucky one day.

27:08.877 --> 27:09.836
Uh-oh.

27:09.919 --> 27:11.379
Same girl we've been talking about?

27:11.463 --> 27:12.422
Yup.

27:13.340 --> 27:15.383
-Finally told her how I feel.
-And?

27:15.467 --> 27:17.802
And nothing!
She didn't even get what I was saying.

27:18.386 --> 27:21.806
Did you say it in plain English
or did you get all actory?

27:22.599 --> 27:25.268
Mm... Little actory maybe?

27:25.352 --> 27:26.269
-Maybe?
-Okay.

27:26.353 --> 27:28.396
I used one of the speeches from the show,

27:28.480 --> 27:29.439
but it's the Bard,

27:29.522 --> 27:31.191
it's not like I'm ever gonna say anything
better than him.

27:31.274 --> 27:33.193
You will
if you're speaking from your heart.

27:34.027 --> 27:36.780
And sometimes it's best
to just keep it simple.

27:39.491 --> 27:40.909
What if she still doesn't get it?

27:43.745 --> 27:46.081
Then maybe it's time to move on.

27:50.627 --> 27:55.548
Now I attempt to be a loving,
forgiving, Christian woman,

27:56.049 --> 27:58.134
but the nerve of that man.

27:58.218 --> 28:01.554
Hm. Bill is nothing if not proof
that common sense ain't common.

28:01.638 --> 28:03.890
All right. What did he take?
'Cause Helen and I will go get it back.

28:03.973 --> 28:05.975
You know I would... It <i>is </i>theft.

28:06.059 --> 28:07.602
-Yeah!
-Do you want me to file a police report?

28:07.686 --> 28:09.187
No. I'm done.

28:10.271 --> 28:12.774
I mean, staring at him in my driveway

28:12.857 --> 28:16.361
with all the leftover junk of our lives,

28:16.444 --> 28:19.280
he is everything
that I do not want anymore.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.449
We had some good times

28:21.533 --> 28:24.786
and he gave me three beautiful children
who are the reason that I breathe,

28:24.869 --> 28:29.541
but, Lord, if I could have just thrown him
out with the trash, I would have.

28:29.624 --> 28:30.583
Amen, sister.

28:31.334 --> 28:33.378
Now we've established
that Bill is not what you want,

28:33.461 --> 28:35.088
can we move on to what you do?

28:35.171 --> 28:38.633
Namely a tall, handsome, ripped coach

28:38.717 --> 28:41.761
who was quizzing me
about your favorite foods the other day.

28:41.845 --> 28:44.264
Oh, really? Since when have you two
become such close friends?

28:44.347 --> 28:47.600
Oh, we are bonding
over the future of Serenity's youth

28:47.684 --> 28:48.810
and it's very noble

28:48.893 --> 28:51.396
and that's not what
we're talking about right now, but you,

28:51.479 --> 28:52.439
Cal,

28:52.772 --> 28:55.734
-dinner, and a possible naked dessert.
-[Dana Sue] Mmm.

28:55.817 --> 28:56.651
Oh.

28:56.735 --> 28:58.570
Okay, I'm gonna need
a little bit of a refill, please.

28:58.653 --> 28:59.779
No, no, no! No.

28:59.863 --> 29:01.197
I'm not gonna pour this out

29:01.281 --> 29:02.741
-until you pour it out.
-Pour it out.

29:02.824 --> 29:03.658
Okay.

29:04.409 --> 29:05.493
I like Cal.

29:05.577 --> 29:06.494
Mm-hmm.

29:06.911 --> 29:08.830
-I want Cal.
-More.

29:08.913 --> 29:13.668
There are no words to describe
how thoroughly and completely I want Cal.

29:13.752 --> 29:14.586
[Dana Sue chuckles]

29:14.669 --> 29:18.089
But I don't know, I just...
I want it to be perfect.

29:18.173 --> 29:19.716
Because so many things are.

29:20.717 --> 29:22.969
Your nerves are talking
and not your heart.

29:23.052 --> 29:25.138
Tell the first to shut up
and listen to the second.

29:25.221 --> 29:27.432
Yeah, and, you know,
this is not just about you.

29:27.515 --> 29:29.058
Okay? I have sworn off men

29:29.142 --> 29:31.770
until the scorch marks
from Ronnie's burnt clothes

29:31.853 --> 29:32.771
are off that lawn,

29:32.854 --> 29:36.232
so you have got to have enough fun
for the both of us,

29:36.316 --> 29:38.109
-you hear me?
-I will, okay.

29:38.193 --> 29:39.652
I just had to get my mind right.

29:39.736 --> 29:41.237
[Dana Sue] All right, get it right.

29:42.155 --> 29:43.740
What's going on over there?

29:43.823 --> 29:44.908
[Helen] Nothing.

29:44.991 --> 29:46.284
We're talking about you.

29:46.367 --> 29:48.119
[Maddie]
Well, now we're talking about you.

29:48.203 --> 29:49.662
Come on, talk to us.

29:51.122 --> 29:52.290
I miss Ryan.

29:55.084 --> 29:55.960
[sighs]

29:56.044 --> 29:57.003
Yeah.

29:57.086 --> 30:00.715
[Helen] Between mock trials
and then this new client, and...

30:01.341 --> 30:03.468
I've been thinking things through a bit,

30:04.344 --> 30:07.222
thinking about how I want my life
to move forward,

30:07.305 --> 30:09.390
what I... what I want for Serenity.

30:10.475 --> 30:11.851
And you two are my rocks,

30:11.935 --> 30:13.019
you know that, but...

30:13.520 --> 30:14.854
sometimes I just...

30:14.938 --> 30:18.566
I want to turn around
and share things with him.

30:18.650 --> 30:20.610
-Yeah.
-But I can't,

30:21.528 --> 30:24.447
because he's discussing irrigation
with farmers in Mali.

30:24.531 --> 30:28.243
Lord, it sounds
so humanitarian and perfect,

30:28.326 --> 30:29.369
you can't even get mad at him.

30:29.452 --> 30:30.620
-Right?
-[Maddie] No.

30:30.703 --> 30:32.163
[Dana Sue] He'll be back, Helen.

30:32.580 --> 30:35.291
You know you deserve to be happy, right?

30:37.502 --> 30:38.461
Both of you do.

30:38.962 --> 30:39.921
We all do.

30:41.673 --> 30:43.216
-Absolutely.
-Okay.

30:43.299 --> 30:44.467
[chuckles]

30:48.304 --> 30:50.306
[phone chiming]

30:50.807 --> 30:51.850
-[Ryan] <i>Hey.</i>
-Oh.

30:53.101 --> 30:55.895
Hey. Oh, no, I'm sorry.

30:55.979 --> 30:57.063
<i>Did I wake you up?</i>

30:57.146 --> 30:58.565
Oh, it's all right. I, um...

30:59.732 --> 31:02.986
I have to leave for Bamako in an hour.

31:03.069 --> 31:04.988
<i>-Is everything okay?</i>
-Oh, I'm fine,

31:05.738 --> 31:07.657
I just wanted to see you, that's all.

31:09.325 --> 31:10.493
<i>I miss you too.</i>

31:10.577 --> 31:11.411
Hmm.

31:11.494 --> 31:14.706
How did your meeting go the other day?

31:15.164 --> 31:16.291
Complicated.

31:17.041 --> 31:19.294
You don't have any contacts
in organic farming

31:19.377 --> 31:21.254
on this side of the Atlantic, do you?

31:21.337 --> 31:23.047
<i>What exactly are you looking for?</i>

31:23.131 --> 31:26.843
[chuckles] I don't know enough about
farming to know what I'm looking for.

31:27.510 --> 31:30.513
My client inherited a piece of land,

31:30.597 --> 31:33.600
uh, that's part of a co-op
that he wants to keep going,

31:33.683 --> 31:37.061
except the deceased
was the money behind everything

31:37.145 --> 31:39.856
and those funds have almost run dry.

31:39.939 --> 31:44.277
<i>So you need someone to help</i> <i>build</i>
<i>new vendor relationships,</i>

31:44.694 --> 31:46.112
<i>find money to rebuild,</i>

31:46.529 --> 31:48.865
and then
get the other members of the group

31:48.948 --> 31:50.867
to take over
what the deceased was handling?

31:50.950 --> 31:52.285
<i>Yes, yes, and yes.</i>

31:52.368 --> 31:53.870
[laughing]

31:54.662 --> 31:56.039
But is that impossible?

31:57.373 --> 31:59.250
Not at all. In fact,

32:00.919 --> 32:01.878
I know a guy.

32:01.961 --> 32:02.921
You do?

32:03.379 --> 32:04.839
[yawning]

32:06.049 --> 32:07.091
Oh, I'm sorry.

32:07.884 --> 32:10.553
You are my hero.

32:11.638 --> 32:12.555
Go to sleep,

32:13.306 --> 32:15.350
and email me the details in the morning.

32:15.808 --> 32:17.310
<i>-Your morning.</i>
-[Helen chuckles]

32:17.393 --> 32:18.436
Will do.

32:19.437 --> 32:20.480
I love you.

32:21.230 --> 32:22.899
<i>-I miss you.</i>
-I love you.

32:23.858 --> 32:24.901
I miss you.

32:28.863 --> 32:30.281
Hmm.

32:36.371 --> 32:37.705
All right, you can open them now.

32:39.248 --> 32:41.834
You're saving for an apartment,
you can't afford this.

32:42.251 --> 32:43.294
Daddy kicked in.

32:43.378 --> 32:48.091
He said no grandbaby of his would be
riding around in no cut-rate car seat.

32:48.174 --> 32:49.175
Thank you.

32:50.426 --> 32:51.970
I'm gonna miss you so much.

32:52.053 --> 32:53.137
I'm gonna miss you too.

32:53.513 --> 32:56.265
I'm so glad I got to see your life here.

32:57.016 --> 32:58.518
I know you said you were fine,

32:59.310 --> 33:01.229
but I had to see for myself.

33:04.857 --> 33:05.733
What?

33:07.735 --> 33:08.987
You're sure you're okay?

33:13.866 --> 33:14.951
See you soon?

33:17.578 --> 33:18.871
Won't be but a blink.

33:18.955 --> 33:19.831
All right.

33:20.707 --> 33:21.666
[Noreen] Be safe.

33:44.063 --> 33:46.190
-Oh! Should we take these two?
-Yeah.

33:46.274 --> 33:48.484
Hey, kids. There's four right here.

33:51.320 --> 33:52.947
-Are you excited?
-Thanks.

33:53.031 --> 33:54.949
-Here, come sit next to me.
-This is fine.

33:55.033 --> 33:56.242
Yeah, just sit right here.

34:05.334 --> 34:07.211
Do you want to switch seats
with me, Katie?

34:07.295 --> 34:08.171
Nope.

34:18.723 --> 34:20.433
-[woman] Here you go, sir.
-Thank you.

34:20.850 --> 34:22.602
Two tickets under Bill Townsend.

34:24.729 --> 34:25.563
Here you are.

34:25.646 --> 34:28.775
And I would like to send a flower
to a cast member.

34:31.277 --> 34:33.821
You know,
flowers aren't really a guy thing.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.239
They are in theater,

34:35.323 --> 34:37.408
and it's a tradition here.
Kyle told me so.

34:40.953 --> 34:43.164
[Bill's phone vibrating]

34:47.043 --> 34:50.463
Oh, Maribelle Stapleton's
got the chicken pox.

41:50.716 --> 41:52.468
Yes. You were.

41:53.093 --> 41:55.971
And you said Maddie didn't understand you,

41:56.055 --> 41:58.057
and you didn't love her anymore,

41:58.140 --> 41:59.183
and I fell for it.

41:59.600 --> 42:01.685
Noreen, that was all true.

42:01.769 --> 42:04.980
Maybe, but it wasn't because of loving me

42:05.064 --> 42:07.525
or because you wanted
to build a family with me,

42:07.942 --> 42:09.610
you just wanted something different.

42:10.194 --> 42:12.905
And maybe you convinced yourself
it was real.

You sure convinced me, but it wasn't.
