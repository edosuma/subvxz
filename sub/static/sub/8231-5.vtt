WEBVTT

00:09.100 --> 00:10.300
- Does this look like a rifle?

00:10.400 --> 00:11.867
- Uh...yeah. Kind of.
- Thanks.

00:11.967 --> 00:13.500
- God, it seems like the season

00:13.600 --> 00:16.033
comes faster every year,
you know?

00:16.133 --> 00:18.433
- Honestly, every person
I run into keeps blabbing

00:18.533 --> 00:21.000
about how awesome
our 4/20 party was last year,

00:21.100 --> 00:22.300
and I'm like, "Bitch,
you don't even know.

00:22.400 --> 00:24.200
This year,
we've got a 42-blunt salute!"

00:24.300 --> 00:26.500
- Dude, I don't even know
what that is,

00:26.600 --> 00:28.500
and I got goose pimples
up and down my arms.

00:28.600 --> 00:29.733
- Yeah.
- Remember how last year,

00:29.833 --> 00:31.633
I lip-synched Cypress Hill
for, like, five hours?

00:31.733 --> 00:33.300
- Yes.

00:33.400 --> 00:35.900
- So this year, I think
I'm just gonna freestyle it.

00:36.000 --> 00:36.633
Just, like, go,
you know what I mean?

00:36.733 --> 00:38.067
You know how I do.

00:38.167 --> 00:41.533
And I'm gonna call myself
"Cypress Chill."

00:41.633 --> 00:42.533
- Get out.

00:42.633 --> 00:44.000
That's what I was
gonna call myself,

00:44.100 --> 00:45.933
except for not "Cypress Chill."

00:46.033 --> 00:47.667
I was gonna call myself
the "Chill Sergeant."

00:47.767 --> 00:49.667
- Happy holidays.

00:49.767 --> 00:51.833
both: Happy holidays.

00:51.933 --> 00:54.300
- I want you guys to go ahead,

00:54.400 --> 00:55.567
and it's a free-for-all
with that box there.

00:55.667 --> 00:58.033
I don't want any of it.
It's all up for grabs.

00:58.133 --> 00:59.633
- Blake, these are your pornogs.
- Yeah.

00:59.733 --> 01:01.300
- What are you doing?
These are classics.

01:01.400 --> 01:01.933
All the pages
are stuck together.

01:02.067 --> 01:04.167
- Yeah. I know.

01:04.267 --> 01:05.167
- You're freaking me
the freak out right now, okay?

01:05.267 --> 01:08.333
Go back in your room
and crank it down.

01:08.433 --> 01:10.433
- Sorry, can't help you
with that one, bud,

01:10.533 --> 01:15.067
because...I'm a boyfriend now.

01:15.100 --> 01:16.600
- Who are you boyfriending?

01:16.700 --> 01:21.633
- Well, my love's name
is Erin Mantini.

01:21.733 --> 01:24.167
- Okay, great, but just
because you've got a girl

01:24.267 --> 01:26.567
doesn't mean you got to get rid
of your whack stash.

01:26.667 --> 01:28.300
- Fellas,
now that I'm a boyfriend,

01:28.400 --> 01:32.300
I'm just sort of above
that kind of behavior, you know?

01:32.400 --> 01:33.867
I mean, I'm in love.

01:33.967 --> 01:35.333
I don't want
to seem like a creep.

01:35.433 --> 01:37.867
[laughs]

01:37.967 --> 01:40.133
[sighs]
I'm in love.

01:43.433 --> 01:45.067
Yes?

[The Skinny Boys' "Jockbox"]

01:48.900 --> 01:49.900
*

01:50.067 --> 01:52.467
- * I'm fresh

01:52.567 --> 01:53.633
* You gotta, we gotta,
you gotta *

01:53.733 --> 01:56.200
* Gotta be fresh

01:58.867 --> 02:01.200
- Dro, dro, dro.

02:01.300 --> 02:01.967
Happy holidays.

02:02.067 --> 02:04.733
both: Happy holidays.

02:04.833 --> 02:06.667
- Whoa, I love what you've done
with the place.

02:06.767 --> 02:09.400
It's so 4/20-friendly.
- Absolutely.

02:09.500 --> 02:11.133
- Okay.
- Ashtray.

02:11.233 --> 02:13.067
- Might've broke the--
- Dig right on in, baby.

02:13.167 --> 02:14.367
all: Ooh.

02:14.467 --> 02:16.367
- We got bowls.
We got blunts.

02:16.467 --> 02:18.800
We got weed bricks that'll
make you feel like an angel

02:18.900 --> 02:21.100
and hash that'll make you feel
like you're on mushrooms.

02:21.200 --> 02:24.100
- Ow!
- Happy four twizzle.

02:24.200 --> 02:25.567
- Why don't you guys get nuts,

02:25.667 --> 02:27.100
and I'm gonna get you
your moola, huh?

02:27.200 --> 02:29.267
- All right, man. Ho, ho, ho!

02:29.367 --> 02:30.733
- I kind of like it.
- Still not friends.

02:30.833 --> 02:32.800
- Last year, you know
I sold out by noon?

02:32.900 --> 02:35.233
I had to go harvest
ditch weed off of exit 311.

02:35.333 --> 02:36.833
- Yo, Chill Sergeant DeMamp!

02:36.933 --> 02:38.800
Did you move the moola?

02:38.900 --> 02:41.633
- I did not move the moola.

02:41.733 --> 02:44.200
In fact, last time
I saw the moola,

02:44.300 --> 02:47.633
it was grazing free range
by the couch.

02:47.733 --> 02:48.667
[laughter]

02:48.767 --> 02:50.267
- Oh, did I forget
to tell you guys?

02:50.367 --> 02:51.700
I got great news.

02:51.800 --> 02:54.967
I sent all $800 to Erin,
my love, in the mail.

02:55.067 --> 02:56.167
- You're joking, right?

02:56.267 --> 02:57.567
You took our money

02:57.667 --> 02:59.633
that we all pooled together
for the entire year

02:59.733 --> 03:02.600
and just gave it
to your girlfriend?

03:02.700 --> 03:04.467
- Guys, she told me there was

03:04.567 --> 03:06.067
a can't-miss
business investment.

03:06.133 --> 03:08.167
Some dude in Algeria
or something,

03:08.267 --> 03:09.867
which, actually,
you dudes owe me,

03:09.967 --> 03:11.700
like, $40 worth of moola

03:11.800 --> 03:14.200
because it took a lot of money
to ship all that loose change.

03:14.300 --> 03:15.900
- Okay, this sounds
like a great investment,

03:16.067 --> 03:17.267
and I wish you all the best.

03:17.367 --> 03:20.067
I hope you get your money back.
- I will.

03:20.100 --> 03:22.233
- But it's 4/20, and there's
no [bleep] layaway plans, okay?

03:22.333 --> 03:24.067
So until shit changes, page me.

03:24.167 --> 03:25.733
- Whoa.

03:25.833 --> 03:28.900
- Can we at least get 42 blunts
until we figure this out?

03:29.067 --> 03:30.200
- Happy holidays.

03:30.300 --> 03:30.800
- Happy holidays.
- Happy holidays.

03:30.900 --> 03:33.767
- Guys, relax.

03:33.867 --> 03:37.267
My love told me that she
is going to mail me the money.

03:37.367 --> 03:41.500
- Why are you guys
mailing stuff to each other?

03:41.600 --> 03:44.233
- Bitch, have you ever
met this woman?

03:44.333 --> 03:46.267
- Do you even know that bitch?

03:46.367 --> 03:47.833
- She's not a bitch, okay?

03:47.933 --> 03:49.400
She's my love,

03:49.500 --> 03:53.100
and we have what you would call
a "cyber romance."

03:53.200 --> 03:53.933
both: So you've never
actually met her?

03:54.067 --> 03:55.533
- We met on the internet,

03:55.633 --> 03:58.500
where a lot of kids
are falling in love nowadays.

03:58.600 --> 04:00.600
You guys are really
outdating yourself here.

04:00.700 --> 04:02.467
- Blake, you stupid dumb idiot
moron bitch.

04:02.567 --> 04:06.133
No offense, but you've been
catfished, okay?

04:06.233 --> 04:07.800
That's what's happening.
- Okay.

04:07.900 --> 04:09.467
- All your ex-girlfriends
are fives.

04:09.567 --> 04:10.500
This chick's a ten.

04:10.600 --> 04:12.800
So that didn't, like, have any

04:12.900 --> 04:14.933
"This bitch probably ain't real"
red flags pop up in your head?

04:15.067 --> 04:16.333
- Who's to say what's real?

04:16.433 --> 04:17.767
And I don't know.
Maybe I really got a winner.

04:17.867 --> 04:19.933
Erin is real!
What are you doing?

04:20.067 --> 04:21.200
- That's it!
- Okay.

04:21.300 --> 04:22.500
- You sit down
and don't make me use 'em!

04:22.600 --> 04:24.067
Don't make me use my muscles!

04:24.133 --> 04:26.633
- "You could never make me
not love you, my love,

04:26.733 --> 04:30.133
but please send me more money
before it's too late, my love."

04:30.233 --> 04:31.833
Dude, she's bleeding you dry.

04:31.933 --> 04:33.500
- She's milking
your money teat, Blake.

04:33.600 --> 04:34.900
- What are you doing?
Don't--

04:35.067 --> 04:36.400
- Sit!
- Relax.

04:36.500 --> 04:37.167
I'm texting her,
inviting her to the party

04:37.267 --> 04:38.767
so we can all meet her.

04:38.867 --> 04:39.900
- No! All right?

04:40.067 --> 04:42.167
We are waiting
for the exact perfect right time

04:42.267 --> 04:43.133
to meet each other.

04:43.233 --> 04:45.067
Please don't do that!

04:45.100 --> 04:47.067
- "Sorry. Can't make it.

04:47.167 --> 04:48.933
Car trouble, my love."

04:49.067 --> 04:51.067
- "Sorry. Can't make it.

04:51.100 --> 04:53.567
Car trouble, my love"?

04:53.667 --> 04:55.933
That is a classic
catfish excuse!

04:56.067 --> 04:56.900
- Totally.

04:57.067 --> 04:58.800
- And no offense,

04:58.900 --> 05:01.533
but I can't believe
you're so stupid, 'cause a girl

05:01.633 --> 05:04.267
this hot is never gonna be
interested in you, no offense.

05:04.367 --> 05:06.767
- All right. Maybe I am ugly.

05:06.867 --> 05:10.700
But maybe what we have
is--is deeper than looks, okay?

05:10.800 --> 05:14.667
I hope you both die
before I walk through this door.

05:14.767 --> 05:16.633
Dang!

05:16.733 --> 05:18.800
- Well, I'm not gonna give up
on 4/20.

05:18.900 --> 05:20.067
- Good.

05:20.100 --> 05:22.233
- So, sadly, I will have
to call out of work today

05:22.333 --> 05:24.300
and launch a full-on recon--

05:24.400 --> 05:25.867
no, wait, a weedcon--

05:25.967 --> 05:28.133
and find enough ditch weed
to roll up 42 blunts

05:28.233 --> 05:29.433
and have a 42-blunt salute

05:29.533 --> 05:30.467
and save the party
and save the day.

05:30.567 --> 05:33.300
- Maybe I could go
catfish some people,

05:33.400 --> 05:34.567
you know, get some easy money.

05:34.667 --> 05:37.067
Sorry, catfish some people,
get some easy moola.

05:37.133 --> 05:39.333
- Okay. I was confused. Yeah.

05:39.433 --> 05:41.300
I didn't know
what you were talking about.

05:41.400 --> 05:42.933
- Yo, Tez, my good friend.

05:43.067 --> 05:45.067
- Just a second.
- Did you get a email?

05:45.133 --> 05:47.367
* Did you get a email, man?

05:47.467 --> 05:50.367
* That's the hook
to the song like blam *

05:50.467 --> 05:52.500
* Gats be spraying,
and I'm just saying *

05:52.600 --> 05:53.967
* Can I--
- Stop. Stop. Stop.

05:54.067 --> 05:55.133
What you doing?

05:55.233 --> 05:56.833
- Sorry. My email's down.

05:56.933 --> 05:58.533
I was wondering if yours
is working and if maybe

05:58.633 --> 06:00.267
you got a email sent to you
that could be, like,

06:00.367 --> 06:01.300
a cool thing you might be into.

06:01.400 --> 06:02.400
I don't know.

06:02.500 --> 06:04.133
- That's okay. Let me see.

06:04.233 --> 06:05.267
Actually, look at this.

06:05.367 --> 06:06.400
- What is it?
- Okay.

06:06.500 --> 06:07.533
Billion Man March.

06:07.633 --> 06:10.167
- Billion Man March? What?

06:10.267 --> 06:12.267
- Only $1,500.

06:12.367 --> 06:13.600
You know what?
I should do it.

06:13.700 --> 06:15.433
- Yes, you should.
Great. Awesome.

06:15.533 --> 06:16.600
- But--but--but I can't.
I can't.

06:16.700 --> 06:19.133
I've been splurging
at the new titty bar...

06:19.233 --> 06:20.667
- No.
- Every day.

06:20.767 --> 06:22.867
Colleen has been
watching me like a hawk.

06:22.967 --> 06:23.900
She everywhere.

06:24.067 --> 06:26.200
All my money
got to go to my children.

06:26.300 --> 06:30.567
- Why am I so ugly, Lord?

06:30.667 --> 06:33.600
The zits, the snot,
the boogers, the stinky butt,

06:33.700 --> 06:37.567
the bad breath, the globs
of earwax in the morning,

06:37.667 --> 06:44.100
my weird teeth,
my stupid hair, my itchy butt,

06:44.200 --> 06:47.967
the BO, the dandruff,
the below-average dick.

06:49.533 --> 06:53.800
What is your plan?

06:53.900 --> 06:55.633
You know every hair on my head,
Lord.

06:55.733 --> 06:57.267
I know you have a plan for me.

06:57.367 --> 06:59.467
*

07:02.667 --> 07:02.867
*

07:04.700 --> 07:05.767
- Aah!

07:05.867 --> 07:08.133
- Oh--you scared me, dude.

07:08.233 --> 07:10.233
Happy holidays.

07:10.333 --> 07:12.567
- Oh, happy holidays!

07:12.667 --> 07:14.300
- Happy holidays.
- Hi!

07:14.400 --> 07:16.800
Who the hell are you?

07:16.900 --> 07:19.267
- My name is
Chill Sergeant DeMamp,

07:19.367 --> 07:20.667
at your service!

07:20.767 --> 07:21.400
- Are you army?
- Well, yeah.

07:21.500 --> 07:23.533
I guess so. Army of one.

07:23.633 --> 07:24.800
- Oh. How many tours
you do, Sergeant?

07:24.900 --> 07:27.400
- It's been a while
since I've gone on a tour,

07:27.500 --> 07:28.433
but I used to go on a lot;
I did the Anheuser-Busch tour.

07:28.533 --> 07:30.967
- Bush!
- Which is cool.

07:31.067 --> 07:32.800
They give you, like, little...
- Yeah, I went through the bush.

07:32.900 --> 07:35.233
- Nips, and then the Play-Doh
tour, that was the shit.

07:35.333 --> 07:37.200
- I have been in the shit,
you understand?

07:37.300 --> 07:39.467
- Cool. Right on.

07:39.567 --> 07:41.933
- But I'm out!
- Yeah, nice.

07:42.067 --> 07:46.067
- My boy.
I know you ca--you--

07:46.167 --> 07:48.767
You want--you want
some ditch weed, don't you?

07:48.867 --> 07:51.167
Well, it's two clicks this way,

07:51.267 --> 07:53.433
so let's roll, Sergeant!

07:53.533 --> 07:56.067
Hey, men!
This is--this is DeMamp.

07:56.167 --> 07:57.667
He's a drill sergeant
in the army.

07:57.767 --> 07:59.067
- I'm a--no.

07:59.100 --> 08:00.700
I'm a chill sergeant. Yeah.

08:00.800 --> 08:03.467
Trying to get a pillowcase
full of weed.

08:03.567 --> 08:04.567
- Yeah.

08:04.667 --> 08:05.867
- A sergeant
with an upside-down

08:05.967 --> 08:07.900
private patch
on your shoulder?

08:08.067 --> 08:09.533
What's the real story?

08:09.633 --> 08:10.833
- My friend Karl--
- Karl?

08:10.933 --> 08:12.700
We hate that son of a bitch.
- Yeah.

08:12.800 --> 08:14.633
He smells like shit.
- Yeah.

08:14.733 --> 08:16.200
He raids our fields at night,

08:16.300 --> 08:19.967
tries to sell our weed
for profit.

08:20.067 --> 08:22.433
Whose side are you on, son?

08:22.533 --> 08:24.833
- There's no sides, guys.

08:24.933 --> 08:27.767
There's not--
let's face it, guys.

08:27.867 --> 08:30.900
4/20 only comes around
once a year,

08:31.067 --> 08:35.267
and it is our job
to make sure that every man,

08:35.367 --> 08:38.367
woman, and child
who wants to get stoned

08:38.467 --> 08:40.067
can get stoned,

08:40.100 --> 08:44.867
because this is America,
the land of the free

08:44.967 --> 08:50.500
and the home of the chill!

08:50.600 --> 08:53.100
Now, let's go get some weed!

08:53.200 --> 08:56.767
- You want us to give you weed
for free, right?

08:56.867 --> 08:58.933
- That's the plan, yes.
- I don't think so.

08:59.067 --> 09:01.700
We're gonna kick your ass.
- Really?

09:01.800 --> 09:02.833
- Yeah.

09:06.067 --> 09:08.933
- Oh, lights out, babe.

09:09.067 --> 09:10.933
- Hey, Bill. Could we talk?

09:11.067 --> 09:13.367
- I was just reading the web.
- Yeah. Relax. It's fine.

09:13.467 --> 09:14.667
I'm into ladies' football.

09:14.767 --> 09:16.067
Go, Chicago Bliss.

09:16.100 --> 09:16.800
See that email on the top there?

09:16.900 --> 09:18.567
What is that? Click on that.

09:18.667 --> 09:19.800
What is that?

09:19.900 --> 09:22.200
- "Please donate
to Save Mammals Now.

09:22.300 --> 09:25.733
"There's been a tsunami in
China, and all the panda bears

09:25.833 --> 09:29.067
are at risk
unless you send $500 now"?

09:29.133 --> 09:30.633
- Not the pandas, Bill!

09:30.733 --> 09:32.200
We got to send money.

09:32.300 --> 09:33.600
- Do you know what I'd do
with $500 if I had it?

09:33.700 --> 09:36.300
For starters,
I'd eat fresh meat.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.433
I've been a freegan
for two months now.

09:38.533 --> 09:40.833
Gas was shut off. Power too.

09:40.933 --> 09:43.067
I've been trading bread
for nudes with my neighbors,

09:43.167 --> 09:44.833
so those are out there now.

09:44.933 --> 09:46.600
Can't wait for those chickens
to come home to roost.

09:46.700 --> 09:47.767
- Okay.

09:47.867 --> 09:49.167
- Can I borrow 100 bucks,
actually?

09:49.267 --> 09:51.567
Just need some trash bags
to sleep in is all.

09:51.667 --> 09:52.733
- Oh, my God. Okay.

09:52.833 --> 09:54.333
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:54.433 --> 09:55.133
Jeez.
- Hi. Hello.

09:55.233 --> 09:57.200
Hey.

09:57.300 --> 09:58.233
TGIF.

10:00.767 --> 10:02.700
Who's ugly now?

10:02.800 --> 10:04.767
- I can't freaking believe

10:04.867 --> 10:06.467
Bill didn't come through
with the moola.

10:06.567 --> 10:08.467
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking the stuff down.

10:08.567 --> 10:10.767
- I almost died
for that ditch weed, okay?

10:10.867 --> 10:11.967
We're gonna--we're gonna
have the 4/20 party.

10:12.067 --> 10:15.333
- We can't have a party
with no bud and no moola.

10:15.433 --> 10:16.333
It's all Blake's fault!
- All right, fine.

10:16.433 --> 10:17.700
It's all my fault.

10:17.800 --> 10:19.933
What do you guys want me to do,
kill myself?

10:20.033 --> 10:20.900
Then you can collect
my life insurance

10:21.000 --> 10:23.333
and have your
stupid awesome party.

10:23.433 --> 10:25.667
- Like you--like you
have life insurance, pal.

10:25.767 --> 10:28.567
By the way, the whole makeup
thing, dude, that's got to go.

10:28.667 --> 10:30.833
That's not happening.
- I'm not wearing any makeup.

10:30.933 --> 10:32.167
- Honestly, you look uglier.
- Yeah.

10:32.267 --> 10:33.533
- You look like
the female gremlin.

10:33.633 --> 10:34.733
- You look like Greta, yeah.

10:34.833 --> 10:36.800
- You look like Greta
the gremlin,

10:36.900 --> 10:38.167
and she was
hideously ugly.

10:38.267 --> 10:39.733
I don't want you
to take offense to that.

10:39.833 --> 10:41.433
Please don't.

10:41.533 --> 10:42.800
- That's it. I'm out of here.

10:42.900 --> 10:44.767
Oh, happy holidays, indeed.

10:44.867 --> 10:45.933
- What a bitch.

10:46.033 --> 10:47.200
- He's a bitch.
[doorbell rings]

10:47.300 --> 10:48.267
And you're getting good
at that, man.

10:48.367 --> 10:49.267
- Thank you.

10:49.367 --> 10:50.967
- Do not stop practicing.
- I won't.

10:51.067 --> 10:52.167
- Happy holi--damn.

10:52.267 --> 10:53.933
Hi.

10:54.033 --> 10:55.867
- Hi. I'm Erin.

10:55.967 --> 10:58.133
I'm a friend of Blake's.

10:58.233 --> 11:01.333
- This is the address
that he gave me for the party.

11:01.433 --> 11:02.733
I'm sorry.

11:02.833 --> 11:05.200
- Don't be sorry about anything

11:05.300 --> 11:07.200
in your whole life, sweetheart.

11:07.300 --> 11:08.833
- Yeah, yeah.
You're--you're real.

11:08.933 --> 11:11.133
You're Erin Mantini, here.
- Yes!

11:11.233 --> 11:12.267
And you must be Ders and Adam.

11:12.367 --> 11:13.600
Blake has told me so much
about you guys.

11:13.700 --> 11:15.933
- Wait; I thought that you

11:16.067 --> 11:17.533
texted you weren't gonna
be here.

11:17.633 --> 11:18.733
- Oh, no, I wanted it to be
a surprise for my love

11:18.833 --> 11:20.400
because our investment
went global,

11:20.500 --> 11:24.867
and I have here $18,000.

11:24.967 --> 11:26.533
Is he here?

11:26.633 --> 11:27.500
- Uh...

11:27.600 --> 11:30.067
- Hi. I'm Erin.

11:31.833 --> 11:33.533
- Say something,
you [bleep] weirdo.

11:33.633 --> 11:34.767
- No offense.

11:34.867 --> 11:35.767
- Hi. Hey.

11:35.867 --> 11:37.900
Erin, it's--

11:38.067 --> 11:40.267
I'm Blake's friend,

11:40.367 --> 11:43.567
Alph--Alphonso.

11:43.667 --> 11:45.267
[with foreign accent]
Howdy. How do you do?

11:45.367 --> 11:47.500
Blake is out of town currently.

11:47.600 --> 11:49.100
- Oh, that's right.

11:49.200 --> 11:50.967
He goes dirt biking
in the desert on Saturdays.

11:51.067 --> 11:52.933
I totally forgot.
- No, he doesn't.

11:53.067 --> 11:54.167
- He will be back tomorrow.

11:54.267 --> 11:55.400
I will take moola from you.

11:55.500 --> 11:57.167
I give to him.

11:57.267 --> 12:00.267
- Oh, no, no, no, I want to see
the look on my love's face

12:00.367 --> 12:01.500
when I hand it to him in person.

12:01.600 --> 12:03.267
It was nice to meet you guys.
- Okay.

12:03.367 --> 12:05.200
You're amazing.
- Happy holidays.

12:06.833 --> 12:09.200
- I need you to be 100%
real with me when I ask you

12:09.300 --> 12:14.300
the question, "Did you send her
a photo of another man?"

12:14.400 --> 12:16.233
- I did.

12:16.333 --> 12:18.067
I'm a catfisher. I catfish--
- You're the catfisherman.

12:18.100 --> 12:19.967
- Yeah. I'm a cyberterrorist.

12:20.067 --> 12:21.100
- Wait; you used a photo

12:21.200 --> 12:22.433
of my likeness, didn't you?

12:22.533 --> 12:25.100
- Actually, I used a picture
of Montez.

12:25.200 --> 12:27.967
- Ew! Why?
- So not--

12:28.067 --> 12:29.967
- Oh, my God!
- What do you mean?

12:30.067 --> 12:32.067
Montez was, like, really
good-looking in high school.

12:32.167 --> 12:33.733
He looked like
French Montana, actually.

12:33.833 --> 12:35.400
- No.
- I'll go talk to her.

12:35.500 --> 12:37.867
I'll explain to her everything,
and I'll get the moola back.

12:37.967 --> 12:39.600
- You can't go talk to her,
'cause if you do,

12:39.700 --> 12:42.300
she's gonna think you're a fat,
pig-faced loser

12:42.400 --> 12:43.500
and not want to talk to you,
no offense.

12:43.600 --> 12:44.833
- Adam, you're right.

12:44.933 --> 12:47.433
I think we got to keep
this fish on the hook.

12:47.533 --> 12:48.133
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

12:52.100 --> 12:53.300
- Happy holidays.

12:53.400 --> 12:54.567
- Happy holidays.
- Happy holidays.

12:54.667 --> 12:57.333
- Whoa, what the hell
are y'all doing here?

12:57.433 --> 12:58.700
You're interrupting
my family bonding time!

12:58.800 --> 13:00.833
- We're in a bit of a pickle,
and we need your help.

13:00.933 --> 13:02.067
- Vlasic.

13:02.167 --> 13:03.833
- Okay.
Junior, hydration station.

13:03.933 --> 13:06.867
Y'all have exactly two minutes.
What?

13:06.967 --> 13:07.633
- Okay,
Blake catfished this woman...

13:07.733 --> 13:09.067
- I hate that word.

13:09.100 --> 13:11.367
- Using a picture of you
from high school,

13:11.467 --> 13:13.600
which we don't understand
either, 'cause--

13:13.700 --> 13:14.633
We're wondering if you
could just pretend to be Blake

13:14.733 --> 13:16.967
for, like, about an hour.

13:17.067 --> 13:18.533
- Hey, bitch. Ooh, sorry.

13:18.633 --> 13:20.067
I didn't know your work friends
were here.

13:20.167 --> 13:21.600
I'm kidding.
Of course I knew.

13:21.700 --> 13:23.267
Listen, I'm gonna go get ready
for dance class.

13:23.367 --> 13:24.567
You're good to go
with the kids tonight?

13:24.667 --> 13:26.800
- Yes, I am, honey.
I was just telling them how--

13:26.900 --> 13:28.233
- Yeah.
I'm already walking away.

13:28.333 --> 13:29.567
- Do you see I'm on thin ice?
- Okay.

13:29.667 --> 13:33.233
What's gonna happen is,
I'm gonna put on a sumo suit.

13:33.333 --> 13:35.533
If I win,
you pretend to be Blake,

13:35.633 --> 13:36.067
and if you win--

13:39.067 --> 13:40.767
- I got it. You're good.

13:40.867 --> 13:45.100
- You won't win 'cause I'm--

13:45.200 --> 13:46.667
I'm gonna beat your ass, dude.
- Yeah.

13:46.767 --> 13:47.933
- Whoo!

13:48.067 --> 13:49.667
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna beat your ass!

13:49.767 --> 13:51.767
I'm gonna beat your ass!

13:51.867 --> 13:53.833
I'm gonna beat
your ass!

13:53.933 --> 13:55.633
I'm gonna beat your ass.

13:55.733 --> 13:56.500
[screaming]
I'm sorry!

13:56.600 --> 13:58.333
- You the bitch!

13:58.433 --> 13:59.900
[yelling]

14:00.067 --> 14:02.600
- Damn!
You got pancaked like a bitch!

14:02.700 --> 14:04.400
- He cheated!

14:04.500 --> 14:06.600
- Hell no. Friendship attack!

14:08.100 --> 14:09.433
- I'm next!

14:11.067 --> 14:13.633
- We family up in here!
- Hell yeah!

14:13.733 --> 14:16.233
- No, no, no, no, no!

14:16.333 --> 14:18.733
[both grunting]

14:18.833 --> 14:20.633
What if we gave you $2,500?

14:20.733 --> 14:22.567
- Man, lead with that.

14:22.667 --> 14:25.400
*

14:27.733 --> 14:30.500
*

14:31.367 --> 14:33.900
- Okay.
Can y'all hear me?

14:34.067 --> 14:35.433
- Yes. We hear you.

14:35.533 --> 14:37.067
- No, I'm talking
about my son Y'all.

14:37.167 --> 14:39.267
Cover his ears.

14:39.367 --> 14:41.300
[watch dings]

14:42.767 --> 14:44.533
- All right.
Here you go, partner. Excellent.

14:44.633 --> 14:46.733
Happy holidays, okay?
Tell your wife I said hello.

14:46.833 --> 14:47.967
- Happy holidays.

14:48.067 --> 14:49.400
- My moon and stars.

14:52.700 --> 14:53.700
- Oh, goddamn.

14:53.800 --> 14:55.067
She's sugar to the core.

14:55.100 --> 14:56.233
- Oh, my gosh.

14:56.333 --> 14:57.367
Blake, you're real!

14:57.467 --> 14:59.633
- Of course I'm real.

14:59.733 --> 15:00.800
- That's my girl.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.567
That's my girl.

15:02.667 --> 15:04.467
- How long has it been?

15:04.567 --> 15:08.167
- You know, it's been
three months

15:08.267 --> 15:09.833
next Wednesday, my love.

15:09.933 --> 15:11.200
- You remembered the day?

15:11.300 --> 15:14.767
- So how many girls
you been with?

15:14.867 --> 15:16.067
- Six, borderline seven.

15:16.100 --> 15:18.967
- Dude, I've been
to the boneyard more than you.

15:19.067 --> 15:21.200
- [mockingly] "Dude, I've been
to the boneyard more than you."

15:21.300 --> 15:23.100
- Guys, please.

15:23.200 --> 15:25.567
- You look a little different
than that picture you sent me.

15:25.667 --> 15:26.933
- That was a little bit ago.

15:27.067 --> 15:29.567
- I mean in a good way.

15:29.667 --> 15:33.367
Usually, I'm only attracted
to long-haired skater types,

15:33.467 --> 15:35.433
you know, skinny slacker bros

15:35.533 --> 15:37.133
who are effortlessly cool
but still have a soft side,

15:37.233 --> 15:38.900
and this is
kind of embarrassing,

15:39.067 --> 15:41.767
but I even dated Carrot Top.

15:41.867 --> 15:43.533
- This is getting
a little crazy, right?

15:43.633 --> 15:45.233
Now, I'm a little--
I'm, like,

15:45.333 --> 15:46.400
a better-looking Carrot Top,
I've been told.

15:46.500 --> 15:48.067
- Way less talent.

15:48.167 --> 15:49.433
- No offense, but you're uglier
and not as talented.

15:49.533 --> 15:51.567
- Okay, wait.
Let me get this straight.

15:51.667 --> 15:53.700
So you're the ugly one, yeah?
And you're the white nerd?

15:53.800 --> 15:56.467
That's what I'm getting.
I can't figure out what you are.

15:56.567 --> 15:58.100
Oh, yeah, that's right.

15:58.200 --> 16:00.133
You're the little bitch
that got beat up by my dad.

16:00.233 --> 16:01.300
- Your dad didn't beat me up.

16:01.400 --> 16:02.733
He cheated.
- Oh, really?

16:02.833 --> 16:05.067
- Yeah, he cheated by using
all of his lard.

16:05.167 --> 16:06.133
- Hey. Hey. Am I gonna have
to separate you two?

16:06.233 --> 16:08.167
- Oh, World Star. World Star.

16:08.267 --> 16:10.567
Ders, do something.
- You--

16:10.667 --> 16:11.667
- Come on!
- Over there.

16:11.767 --> 16:13.367
You stay right here. Sit down!

16:13.467 --> 16:14.633
Junior, you play with that.

16:14.733 --> 16:15.633
Adam--

16:15.733 --> 16:16.600
- Ooh.

16:16.700 --> 16:18.933
You got me--
oh, I love these things.

16:19.067 --> 16:20.367
[both laughing]

16:20.467 --> 16:22.267
- This just seems so natural,
right?

16:22.367 --> 16:25.067
It's like I can
tell you anything.

16:25.100 --> 16:26.800
- Oh, like--like what?

16:26.900 --> 16:30.300
- I'm actually having some
dirty thoughts about you and me.

16:30.400 --> 16:31.933
- It's just me and you here.

16:32.067 --> 16:33.900
You can tell me anything.

16:34.067 --> 16:37.167
- I know you told me
that you have a very big penis.

16:37.267 --> 16:40.200
Mm,
it's kind of embarrassing,

16:40.300 --> 16:43.367
but I have a very shallow
cervix.

16:43.467 --> 16:44.367
- Whoa.

16:44.467 --> 16:45.700
- And it's very painful

16:45.800 --> 16:47.067
for me to have sex
with big guys.

16:47.100 --> 16:49.500
- What?
- Really.

16:49.600 --> 16:53.700
Below average or, ideally,
a micro-penis is perfect.

16:53.800 --> 16:56.100
- Did you hear that?
We're meant to be.

16:56.200 --> 16:57.267
God made us for each other!

16:57.367 --> 16:58.067
Please, let me go, Ders!

16:58.100 --> 16:59.500
- No. Just keep texting.

16:59.600 --> 17:04.367
- Oh! Dudes, I'm sold out.
Like, entirely.

17:04.467 --> 17:06.800
The holiday shopping season
is over.

17:06.900 --> 17:08.600
- I hope that doesn't ruin
any thoughts that are

17:08.700 --> 17:10.800
running around in that
handsome little head of yours.

17:10.900 --> 17:12.400
- Not at all.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.633
Actually--

17:14.733 --> 17:16.067
- He turned his phone off.

17:16.133 --> 17:17.433
He's completely gone rogue.

17:17.533 --> 17:20.067
He's trying to steal
my love away from me, Ders.

17:20.100 --> 17:21.500
- I say let it fly,

17:21.600 --> 17:22.800
and I think you should start
using your noodle,

17:22.900 --> 17:24.667
not your heart.

17:27.100 --> 17:27.967
- He did it.

17:28.067 --> 17:29.367
- You want to get nuts?
- Yeah!

17:29.467 --> 17:31.133
- Let's get nuts!
- Yeah. Yeah.

17:31.233 --> 17:32.600
- Oh, yeah. We gonna tear it up.

17:32.700 --> 17:35.067
[all speaking at once]

17:35.167 --> 17:36.333
- Okay. Where's the bed?

17:36.433 --> 17:39.433
- The bed is, like--
- Stop it now!

17:39.533 --> 17:41.667
- Oh, no, oh, no.
- No! No!

17:41.767 --> 17:45.167
- Oh, let's do that.
- Yeah, definitely do that.

17:47.867 --> 17:49.233
- Blake, Stop!
- Hey, hey.

17:49.333 --> 17:50.800
Whoa, hey.
- What's going on?

17:50.900 --> 17:53.700
- Fancy meeting you two here.
- Hi. What's happening?

17:53.800 --> 17:56.833
- You remember me, Erin.
Um, okay.

17:56.933 --> 17:58.400
I just have to get something
off my chest.

17:58.500 --> 17:59.067
- I knew it.
- What's going on?

17:59.100 --> 18:02.400
- Oh, my God.

18:02.500 --> 18:04.433
- Go to the arcade.
- Cool.

18:04.533 --> 18:06.767
- I'm sorry; what is going on,
and who are you?

18:06.867 --> 18:08.267
- I'm his wife. Who are you?

18:08.367 --> 18:09.967
- You're married?
- Okay.

18:10.067 --> 18:12.833
Dudes, you want to step in here?
- No.

18:12.933 --> 18:14.167
- Not really. I don't.
- Okay.

18:14.267 --> 18:16.500
This ain't what it looks like.
See, let me explain.

18:16.600 --> 18:17.967
See, these idiots--
- No, actually, I can explain.

18:18.067 --> 18:19.633
I'm not mad.

18:19.733 --> 18:21.500
- You're not mad?
- No. I'm actually relieved.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.600
Honey, I love you.
I love our marriage.

18:23.700 --> 18:26.733
I love our family, our house,
all our possessions.

18:26.833 --> 18:28.733
But recently, I signed up
for Ashley Madison 'cause

18:28.833 --> 18:33.067
I want us to be open,
and I want us to share together

18:33.167 --> 18:34.100
and have fun again.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.633
- Baby, I want that too.

18:35.733 --> 18:39.167
- I think I'm gonna go
and let you two work this out.

18:39.267 --> 18:40.667
- Yeah.
- No. Really, it's okay.

18:40.767 --> 18:42.067
And we're all adults here.
- Mm-hmm.

18:42.100 --> 18:43.500
- And you two, it looks like,
were really hitting it off.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.733
Frankly,
it was really freaking hot.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.833
- And she got
a little coochie too.

18:47.933 --> 18:50.267
I mean--
- [whispering indistinctly]

18:50.367 --> 18:52.600
- Goddamn, I love you, woman.

18:52.700 --> 18:54.267
- You know,
maybe you could stick around

18:54.367 --> 18:55.333
and the three of us can,
you know,

18:55.433 --> 18:56.800
try something new together.

18:58.367 --> 18:59.767
- I'm always down
for something new.

18:59.867 --> 19:02.167
- Mm...want something here.

19:02.267 --> 19:04.267
- Hot damn!
- Oh!

19:04.367 --> 19:05.833
- Baby, bam.

19:05.933 --> 19:09.800
*

19:09.900 --> 19:11.467
- * Grando

19:11.567 --> 19:13.933
[loud moaning and groaning]
- Where are my parents?

19:14.067 --> 19:16.300
- They are--
they got food poisoning.

19:16.400 --> 19:19.967
- From eating
each other's butt[bleep],

19:20.067 --> 19:22.600
which is what they're doing
in there, definitely.

19:22.700 --> 19:26.433
- [panting]

19:26.533 --> 19:27.633
- Erin.
- Let's go home.

19:27.733 --> 19:29.967
- Aww. Come on, y'all.

19:30.067 --> 19:31.967
- See you later, guys.
Eat [bleep], Adam.

19:32.067 --> 19:33.667
- Yeah, you mean
like your parents just did

19:33.767 --> 19:35.933
out of a stranger's bum-bum?

19:36.067 --> 19:37.667
Hey, there's no way
you've had more sex than me!

19:37.767 --> 19:41.567
- That was some
freaky-deaky biz-nass

19:41.667 --> 19:43.233
that was going on in there.

19:43.333 --> 19:44.767
Thank you, thank you, and,

19:44.867 --> 19:48.233
Blake, most of all, thank you.

19:48.333 --> 19:50.600
Here is $800 for you.

19:50.700 --> 19:51.633
That's $2,500 for me,

19:51.733 --> 19:53.667
and the rest
go to the manager,

19:53.767 --> 19:54.700
'cause guess what.

19:54.800 --> 19:58.067
We did some damage in there.

19:58.167 --> 20:00.467
Happy holidays.
both: Happy holidays.

20:00.567 --> 20:01.333
- Happy holidays to you.
- All right.

20:01.433 --> 20:02.600
Chill Sergeant DeMamp

20:02.700 --> 20:07.333
states the 4/20 party
is back on!

20:07.433 --> 20:08.533
- Dude, Karl's sold out of weed.

20:08.633 --> 20:12.033
Where are we gonna find
any weed on 4/20 eve?

20:12.133 --> 20:15.133
- Yeah.
Now, that's what I call moola.

20:15.233 --> 20:16.833
- Happy holidays to you.
- Yeah.

20:16.933 --> 20:19.533
- Happy holidays, my main man.
- Happy holidays.

20:19.633 --> 20:20.867
- Oh, dude. Perfect timing.

20:20.967 --> 20:23.333
Cypress Chill's
about to take stage.

20:23.433 --> 20:24.267
- All right.
Goody, goody, goody.

20:24.367 --> 20:25.767
- What's going on?

20:25.867 --> 20:28.700
- Ah, well, you know,
Erin broke up with me.

20:28.800 --> 20:30.900
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.700
I guess Montez had, like,
a really big dong or something.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.333
I feel super sorry for her.

20:35.433 --> 20:38.233
Like, you big-dicked freak show.

20:38.333 --> 20:40.333
Like, join the circus
with your lasso dick.

20:40.433 --> 20:41.600
It's all good, though.

20:41.700 --> 20:43.367
You guys should get
pretty excited

20:43.467 --> 20:45.533
'cause there's some
Blake Chesterfield Hender-nachos

20:45.633 --> 20:47.100
about to come out the oven!

20:47.200 --> 20:48.367
Here's the--this
is the real meaning of 4/20.

20:48.467 --> 20:50.167
- You ready to get rocked?

20:50.267 --> 20:51.500
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:51.600 --> 20:53.100
Are you going
to freestyle rap, though?

20:53.200 --> 20:54.500
- No, pretty terrified
about doing that

20:54.600 --> 20:56.100
in front of people, so...

20:56.200 --> 20:58.233
- Yeah, and also, no offense,
you're really bad at it.

20:58.333 --> 21:00.400
- * Pick it, pack it,
fire it off *

21:00.500 --> 21:03.800
* Come along and take a hit
from the bong *

21:03.900 --> 21:05.167
* Put the blunt down
just for a second *

21:05.267 --> 21:08.700
* Don't get me wrong,
it's not a new method *

21:08.800 --> 21:10.067
- Nice.

21:15.600 --> 21:16.700
- * Yes, I'm on the white
on the outside *

21:16.800 --> 21:18.400
* But I'm black deep down

21:18.500 --> 21:19.933
* Sometimes I feel like
I might even be brown *

21:21.200 --> 21:22.933
No?

21:27.567 --> 21:27.933
- [laughs]
