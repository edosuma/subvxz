You're supposed to sound
like Bela Lugosi, not Pat Boone.

01:45.639 --> 01:46.902
Let's take a break.

01:47.007 --> 01:48.338
All right, okay,
we'll take a break.

01:48.442 --> 01:49.967
It-it'll be all right.
We'll get it.

01:50.077 --> 01:52.637
Boys, boys, look,
come here, look.

01:52.746 --> 01:54.305
I'm not here.
You don't know me.

01:54.414 --> 01:55.472
You haven't seen me.

01:55.582 --> 01:56.515
POTSIE and RICHIE:
What?! Al!

01:56.617 --> 01:57.675
So keep me covered.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.548
Keep me covered
till I get to the bathroom.

01:59.653 --> 02:00.848
- Al, come on.
- Act natural.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.718
- I got to hide.
- You want to hide, Al?

02:02.823 --> 02:03.984
Why don't you comb your hair

02:04.091 --> 02:05.650
over your face
and pretend that you're...

02:05.759 --> 02:07.193
Man, Al's really nervous.

02:07.294 --> 02:09.023
He didn't even stay
for my punch line.

02:09.128 --> 02:11.325
Yeah, yeah,
we better check this out.

02:11.431 --> 02:13.661
Hey, wait, Rich-- maybe he
doesn't want us to interfere.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.360
(Al sobbing)

02:15.469 --> 02:17.460
- We'll interfere.
- Right.

02:18.739 --> 02:20.036
He's disappeared.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.938
- Well, he's got to be
in here somewhere. -Yeah.

02:22.042 --> 02:23.532
- Is she here yet?
-(Ralph screams)

02:23.644 --> 02:25.772
Oh, Al, come on, man.

02:25.879 --> 02:27.369
What's... what's going on here?

02:27.481 --> 02:28.846
Old lady-- she wants to get me.

02:28.949 --> 02:30.917
I got to hide.
Fear, fear, fear.

02:31.018 --> 02:32.383
Calm, calm, calm.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.147
Are you all right now?

02:34.254 --> 02:36.916
Tell me, why are you scared
of an old lady?

02:37.024 --> 02:39.254
Oh, Rich, I don't know
if I can talk about it.

02:39.359 --> 02:41.225
Very frightening.
It's very scary.

02:41.328 --> 02:42.693
Go ahead.

02:42.796 --> 02:45.697
Well, she wants
to put a curse on me.

02:45.799 --> 02:47.096
-(laughing)
- Oh, man.

02:47.200 --> 02:49.362
I can't believe it.
(laughs)

02:49.469 --> 02:51.335
That's really funny, Al.

02:51.438 --> 02:53.964
You're acting this way
over a so-called curse?

02:54.074 --> 02:55.633
-(laughs)
- Hey, guys, wait a minute.

02:55.742 --> 02:57.403
L-I... I think Al's serious.

02:57.511 --> 02:58.842
- I am serious.
- What?

02:58.945 --> 03:01.915
You see, she's a DiMartino,
and I'm a Delvecchio.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.040
And they've been fighting
in the old neighborhood

03:04.151 --> 03:05.846
ever since I can remember.

03:05.952 --> 03:07.920
Ah, come on, Al,
you must be joshing.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.614
You can't believe in a curse.

03:09.723 --> 03:13.057
I didn't until Uncle Dominic
made her mad once.

03:13.160 --> 03:14.628
- Mm-hmm.
- What happened?

03:14.728 --> 03:16.355
She gave him the evil eye.

03:16.463 --> 03:18.295
<i>Un malocchio.</i>

03:19.566 --> 03:22.263
I don't want to go into detail,
but they say,

03:22.369 --> 03:27.068
ever since, he lives
on a lily pad and eats flies.

03:27.174 --> 03:28.835
A frog. (chuckles)

03:28.942 --> 03:31.434
Beats Arnold Burgers.
(laughs)

03:31.545 --> 03:34.537
Even in the Twilight Zone,
I still got it.

03:34.648 --> 03:37.174
Uncle Dominic used to make
jokes like that.

03:37.284 --> 03:39.810
- And then...
-(Ralph gasps)

03:40.954 --> 03:43.252
Come on, Al, this is
the 20th century.

03:43.356 --> 03:45.415
There aren't witches anymore,
are there?

03:45.525 --> 03:47.015
Of course, there aren't.

03:47.127 --> 03:48.458
Look, Al, uh, we...

03:48.562 --> 03:50.360
we got to get back out there
and rehearse,

03:50.464 --> 03:51.761
but you got to calm down.

03:51.865 --> 03:53.924
I'm sure this little old lady
is not after you,

03:54.034 --> 03:55.399
so just relax, all right?

03:55.502 --> 03:57.129
- Okay. Thanks, Rich. I'll try.
- Okay.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.467
Yeah. How bad could it be
being a frog?

03:59.573 --> 04:01.234
RICHIE:
Oh, Potsie.

04:01.341 --> 04:04.003
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:06.379 --> 04:08.848
You knew they wouldn't
understand about the evil eye.

04:08.949 --> 04:10.542
<i>Un malocchio.</i>

04:11.585 --> 04:13.917
It scares me every time.

04:14.020 --> 04:16.387
No, they're not Delvecchios

04:16.490 --> 04:20.051
or Rosselinis or Fonzarellis...

04:20.160 --> 04:22.527
Of course. Fonzarelli.

04:22.629 --> 04:24.222
(knocking at door)

04:25.198 --> 04:26.962
Hello...

04:27.067 --> 04:29.399
Anybody here?

04:29.503 --> 04:31.767
Fonzie?

04:31.872 --> 04:33.863
Witch?

05:01.768 --> 05:03.862
(banging at door)

05:03.970 --> 05:06.337
(imitating Fonzie):
Heyyy. Who's there?

05:07.474 --> 05:09.943
FONZIE (muffled):
Heyyy. Bad imitation.

05:12.512 --> 05:14.810
Oh, Fonz, come on in.

05:23.190 --> 05:24.589
Wednesday night cleaning crew?

05:24.691 --> 05:26.989
Instantaneous explanation, Al.

05:27.093 --> 05:28.185
I'm sorry for breaking in,

05:28.295 --> 05:29.763
but there's this woman
that's after me.

05:29.863 --> 05:31.126
I get the picture.

05:31.231 --> 05:32.756
What, you know this woman
that's after me?

05:32.866 --> 05:34.300
Well, she's a witch.

05:34.401 --> 05:36.768
It happens to all of us, Al.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.770
Fonz, I'm desperate.
I came to you for help.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.738
- Now, I need your help.
- I'm listening to your story.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.673
- Go ahead.
- Well, you see what happened,

05:42.776 --> 05:44.266
there's this little old lady...

05:44.377 --> 05:51.750
(vacuum cleaner whirring loudly)

05:53.587 --> 05:54.850
(vacuum cleaner stops)

05:54.955 --> 05:58.084
...so, you see,
if she gets me, then it's

05:58.191 --> 06:01.161
good-bye, Arnold Burgers;
hello, flies.

06:01.261 --> 06:03.593
All right. Let me get
this story straight.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.461
- This chick is chasing you.
- Yeah.

06:05.565 --> 06:08.694
- And this chick is a witch.
- Yeah, yeah.

06:08.802 --> 06:12.295
I'm a little fuzzy on the,
uh, frog part, you know.

06:12.405 --> 06:15.841
But, uh, what I got to say
to you is this, Al.

06:15.942 --> 06:17.535
Beauty is skin deep.

06:17.644 --> 06:19.635
Let it happen.

06:28.088 --> 06:29.681
Perfectamundo.

06:29.789 --> 06:31.382
(women squeal happily)

06:31.491 --> 06:34.324
But, Fonz, what am I gonna do
about the witch?

06:34.427 --> 06:35.861
All right, Al,
I'll tell you exactly

06:35.962 --> 06:37.623
what you do
about this chick, all right?

06:37.731 --> 06:39.529
Unknown restaurant, dark.

06:39.633 --> 06:42.728
Corner booth,
separate checks, huh?

06:42.836 --> 06:44.270
Never mind, Fonz.

06:44.371 --> 06:46.669
I'll go hide.

06:48.375 --> 06:51.208
He's so shy.

06:51.311 --> 06:54.804
I'll have our costumes
ready by tonight, Howard.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.941
Marion, I look silly this way.

06:58.051 --> 07:01.112
Oh, no, dear,
that's a very nice suit.

07:01.221 --> 07:03.883
I'm talking about this costume!

07:03.990 --> 07:05.082
Oh, come on, Dad.

07:05.191 --> 07:06.386
<i>Don't be a party POOP"-.</i>

07:06.493 --> 07:07.688
Yes, Howard, get in the spirit.

07:07.794 --> 07:09.023
This is Halloween.

07:09.129 --> 07:10.756
This is the night
of the supernatural,

07:10.864 --> 07:13.663
the night when witches
and goblins roam the countryside

07:13.767 --> 07:15.667
and the wind howls

07:15.769 --> 07:18.136
and spirits rise
from their graves.

07:18.238 --> 07:20.229
Oh, I scared myself.

07:20.340 --> 07:21.933
(knocking at door)

07:30.717 --> 07:32.708
Wasn't that Al?

07:32.819 --> 07:34.753
Sorry for bursting in
like this,

07:34.854 --> 07:36.845
but she's out there somewhere.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.254
I don't see her.

07:38.358 --> 07:40.053
Who am I looking for?

07:40.160 --> 07:41.321
Yeah, well, I told you, Mom.

07:41.428 --> 07:43.260
- Remember the old lady?
- Yeah, the old lady.

07:43.363 --> 07:44.888
She's following me.
She's following me.

07:44.998 --> 07:46.488
I need help. I need help.

07:46.599 --> 07:48.966
Al, don't you think you're
getting a little carried away?

07:49.069 --> 07:50.298
Yeah, I guess so.

07:50.403 --> 07:51.598
Hide me. Hide me.

07:51.705 --> 07:53.173
He's getting carried away.

07:53.273 --> 07:54.672
Look, if it'll help you any,

07:54.774 --> 07:56.902
-you're welcome to stay in
the guest room tonight. -Yes.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.273
Oh, thanks.

07:58.378 --> 08:00.210
Now, you're real friends.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.474
Well, good night.

08:01.581 --> 08:02.742
I'll see you in the morning.

08:02.849 --> 08:04.078
HOWARD:
What?

08:04.184 --> 08:07.051
Al, it's only 6:30.

08:07.153 --> 08:09.087
Isn't it a little early
to go to bed?

08:09.189 --> 08:12.716
Oh, not really. I plan on
having trouble falling asleep.

08:12.826 --> 08:17.263
Look, Al, just sit down here
and relax, huh?

08:17.364 --> 08:18.456
I'm tense, Howard.

08:18.565 --> 08:20.033
MARION:
Yes, Al, relax.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.532
Hey. everybody.

08:21.634 --> 08:24.535
- RICHIE: Hey, Fonz.
- MARION: Arthur.

08:24.637 --> 08:26.901
I've been looking
all over for you.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.533
I got a surprise,
gonna put a snap in your trunks.

08:29.642 --> 08:31.007
(Fonzie chuckles)

08:31.111 --> 08:35.775
I feel like... I feel like that
guy from This Is Your Life.

08:35.881 --> 08:37.350
Whoa. Al.

08:37.450 --> 08:39.544
Here she is,
an old friend of yours,

08:39.652 --> 08:43.350
waiting outside the door
just for you, brought her in.

08:45.792 --> 08:47.191
Lovely people.

08:47.293 --> 08:48.954
- Lovely house.
- HOWARD: How do you do?

08:49.062 --> 08:50.188
Lovely.

08:50.296 --> 08:52.128
Hello, Al.

08:52.232 --> 08:54.860
(hissing)

08:56.236 --> 08:57.567
(cackling)

08:57.670 --> 08:59.263
I'm cursed!

09:01.074 --> 09:02.405
Oh, she's got a curse doll.

09:02.509 --> 09:05.410
(woman cackling)

09:05.512 --> 09:07.913
Curse Delvecchio.

09:08.014 --> 09:11.973
It's only fitting
that your right arm

09:12.085 --> 09:15.146
should do my bidding.

09:15.255 --> 09:16.950
-(woman cackling)
-(groaning)

09:17.057 --> 09:20.152
(yelling)

09:23.363 --> 09:26.264
(cackling)

09:26.366 --> 09:28.562
Lovely people.

09:28.668 --> 09:31.194
Lovely.

09:33.006 --> 09:34.974
She's in control
of my right arm.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.167
Hey, Al?

09:36.276 --> 09:39.041
I'll bet she gets nicer
on the second date.

09:51.958 --> 09:53.892
Well...

09:53.993 --> 09:56.325
Well, boys, here's your orders.

09:56.429 --> 10:00.457
Chocolate sundae, banana split
and a garlic necklace.

10:00.567 --> 10:01.728
Thanks, Al.

10:01.835 --> 10:03.098
- Oh... (laughs)
- Come on.

10:03.203 --> 10:06.036
Just playing it safe.
It wards off evil spirits.

10:06.139 --> 10:07.664
Where's yours, Al?

10:07.774 --> 10:10.744
It's too late for me, Pots.

10:10.844 --> 10:12.403
Well, yeah,
but it's good to see you

10:12.512 --> 10:13.911
up and around,
working again, Al.

10:14.013 --> 10:15.913
Well... life goes on.

10:16.015 --> 10:18.848
But for how long, who knows?

10:18.952 --> 10:21.649
Once the evil eye
has winked at you.

10:21.754 --> 10:24.519
Oh, Al, you don't believe
that old lady and her curse.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.456
Curse.

10:26.559 --> 10:28.118
(Ralph squealing)

10:28.228 --> 10:29.252
(Al sighs)

10:29.362 --> 10:30.796
Oh, thanks, Rich.

10:30.897 --> 10:32.160
Are-are you all right?

10:32.265 --> 10:34.165
All right? I'm doomed.

10:34.267 --> 10:36.759
I'll go get your water.

10:36.870 --> 10:38.031
He's a wreck.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.697
- I'm telling you,
the man is a wreck. -Yeah.

10:39.806 --> 10:41.274
I can't believe you guys.

10:41.374 --> 10:43.604
I can't believe you aren't
wearing garlic necklaces.

10:43.710 --> 10:46.805
It's guaranteed to keep away
the forces of darkness.

10:46.913 --> 10:48.779
Ralph, there's nothing
to be afraid of.

10:48.882 --> 10:50.441
Can't you see it's all
in Al's mind?

10:50.550 --> 10:52.712
And he's building it up,
he's making it worse and worse.

10:52.819 --> 10:53.911
You know, Rich is right.

10:54.020 --> 10:55.749
My psychology professor
says that people

10:55.855 --> 10:57.380
can talk themselves
into believing anything.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.254
Sure, well, you notice
how every time we say

10:59.359 --> 11:01.020
-the word "curse," he reacts?
- Yeah.

11:01.127 --> 11:03.221
- So let's not say that
word anymore. -Okay. Okay.

11:04.297 --> 11:06.959
Here's your water.

11:07.066 --> 11:10.195
- You'll notice I'm using
my left hand. -Yeah.

11:10.303 --> 11:12.271
- Oh, yeah, because of your...
- Potsie!

11:12.372 --> 11:13.533
You almost said "curse."

11:13.640 --> 11:14.903
Ah-ah!

11:15.008 --> 11:17.204
Oh! Oh!

11:17.310 --> 11:19.005
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no! Oh, no!

11:19.112 --> 11:20.910
Does garlic work when it's wet?

11:21.014 --> 11:22.482
It does in spaghetti sauce.

11:22.582 --> 11:24.744
Al, you got to get
a hold of yourself.

11:24.851 --> 11:27.343
Yeah, I mean,
all I said was "curse."

11:27.453 --> 11:29.046
-(Al gasping)
- No, Al!

11:29.155 --> 11:31.783
- Oh!
- Oh, gosh.

11:31.891 --> 11:34.588
Oh, I'm sorry, Rich.

11:34.694 --> 11:38.153
I'll just charge you
half price for that.

11:40.934 --> 11:44.131
Look, Al, I know it's my fault
you're in this jam, right?

11:44.237 --> 11:46.706
I mean, how did I know
that old lady was gonna put

11:46.806 --> 11:48.467
a curse on you,
something like that?

11:48.575 --> 11:50.703
What, what, what?
Oh, I get it, I get it.

11:50.810 --> 11:52.039
He reacts to "curse."

11:52.145 --> 11:53.635
Al! Al!

11:53.746 --> 11:55.578
Sorry, Fonz. It's not me.

11:55.682 --> 11:57.013
Yeah, I understand.

11:57.116 --> 11:58.447
I understand, Alfredo.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.918
And I think I got
a solution right here.

12:01.020 --> 12:02.112
- Whoa? What solution?
- You got a solution? -What?

12:02.222 --> 12:03.849
Dig it. Dig it.

12:03.957 --> 12:07.359
I remember hearing about
a ceremony-- right, Red?

12:07.460 --> 12:12.091
A ceremony that, uh,
breaks curses, you know.

12:12.198 --> 12:14.860
Hey, Al, get a hold
of yourself, man.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.766
Oh, well, it's been
so long that I...

12:16.869 --> 12:18.928
I forgot about it,
but I know what you're saying.

12:19.038 --> 12:21.268
The old, uh,
"remove the curse" ceremony.

12:21.374 --> 12:24.469
Right. Al, Al, there we go.
All right.

12:24.577 --> 12:25.874
That's right. Now, look.

12:25.979 --> 12:27.242
We'll all meet
at Richie's house, okay?

12:27.347 --> 12:28.439
A little later on.

12:28.548 --> 12:29.572
- Can you make it?
- Mm-hmm.

12:29.682 --> 12:30.740
All right.

12:30.850 --> 12:32.841
You smell like a pizza.

12:32.952 --> 12:34.147
- Later.
- Later.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.086
Oh, boy.
I'll do anything.

12:36.189 --> 12:39.159
You don't know what it is to not
have control over your hand.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.886
Don't worry, Al. We're gonna
get rid of that curse for you.

12:40.994 --> 12:41.893
Right.

12:41.995 --> 12:43.895
Curse...

12:43.997 --> 12:45.692
-(woman yelps)
- Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

12:45.798 --> 12:47.232
- WOMAN: Oh!
- Oh, pardon me.

12:47.333 --> 12:49.563
-(woman yelps twice)
- It's not me. It's this hand.

12:49.669 --> 12:51.159
This one.

12:52.639 --> 12:54.869
(chuckles)
Did you see that?

12:54.974 --> 12:56.806
Oh, my hand is cursed!

12:56.909 --> 12:58.900
I have no control!

13:04.150 --> 13:07.279
(thunder crashes)

13:10.690 --> 13:12.385
(dramatically):
Hello... (chuckles)

13:12.492 --> 13:14.392
- MARION: Richard?
- Yeah.

13:14.494 --> 13:15.825
Oh, uh, we're upstairs, dear!

13:15.928 --> 13:17.657
Hurry and get in your costume!

13:17.764 --> 13:19.323
Oh, I can't right now!

13:19.432 --> 13:21.491
I got to set the living room up
for an exorcism!

13:21.601 --> 13:22.830
MARION:
Good, dear!

13:22.935 --> 13:24.494
HOWARD:
An exorcism?!

13:24.604 --> 13:26.595
Yeah.

13:39.185 --> 13:41.210
Well, it's true what they say.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.153
Married people do start
to look alike.

13:43.256 --> 13:44.553
(laughing)

13:45.591 --> 13:48.424
That's not funny, Richard.

13:48.528 --> 13:50.929
Now, what's all this business
about an exorcism?

13:51.030 --> 13:52.259
Oh, well, the situation with Al

13:52.365 --> 13:54.094
has gotten completely
out of hand, see,

13:54.200 --> 13:56.134
so we're gonna have
this-this real hokey ceremony

13:56.235 --> 13:58.329
to try and remove the curse.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.668
You mean Al believes
in that curse?

14:00.773 --> 14:02.673
Oh, come on.
That's ridiculous, Richard.

14:02.775 --> 14:04.607
Well, not necessarily, Howard.

14:04.711 --> 14:07.180
Mother Kelp had a neighbor
who was cursed.

14:07.280 --> 14:12.946
Anyone who lives next to
your mother is cursed, Marion.

14:13.052 --> 14:15.612
But, Dad, whether we believe in
it or not makes no difference.

14:15.722 --> 14:18.020
Al believes
in this lady's magic.

14:18.124 --> 14:19.421
So we're gonna give him
bigger magic, see?

14:19.525 --> 14:20.754
We're gonna have all kinds
of things.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.352
Like, uh, lightning...
(mimics lightning strike)

14:23.463 --> 14:26.433
And we're gonna have thunder...
(mimics thunder rumbling)

14:26.532 --> 14:30.435
Monsters...
(grunting)

14:30.536 --> 14:32.766
All kinds of evil spirits.

14:32.872 --> 14:35.068
(mimics eerie sound effect)

14:35.174 --> 14:37.074
That sounds like such fun.

14:37.176 --> 14:39.144
I'd rather stay here
than go to the Leopard Lodge.

14:39.245 --> 14:42.146
Oh, no! I spent seven dollars
for those tickets

14:42.248 --> 14:43.943
and we're going- come on.

14:44.050 --> 14:46.041
(banging at door)

14:48.421 --> 14:50.412
(thunder rumbling)

14:53.192 --> 14:54.091
Who is this, dear?

14:54.193 --> 14:55.820
That's Ralph Malph, honey.

14:55.928 --> 14:58.226
Oh, no, it's Igor.

14:58.331 --> 14:59.890
The bridge is washed out.

14:59.999 --> 15:01.763
You have to spend the night.

15:01.868 --> 15:02.960
(chuckles)

15:03.069 --> 15:06.630
Even bent over,
I got it, huh, Rich?

15:06.739 --> 15:08.639
Did you get the stuff?
That's the important thing.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.505
Right here.

15:10.610 --> 15:12.044
Well, come on,
we better be going.

15:12.145 --> 15:13.442
Okay, but be careful, dear,

15:13.546 --> 15:15.207
you're wearing my favorite mop.

15:15.314 --> 15:18.306
Joanie, hurry up!

15:20.653 --> 15:22.747
Have fun, guys!

15:22.855 --> 15:25.085
I'm off to find
a treasure trunk,

15:25.191 --> 15:26.886
but I'd settle
for a pirate hunk!

15:26.993 --> 15:29.018
<i>Arum!</i>

15:29.128 --> 15:32.029
Come on, Captain Kidd--
we'll drop you off at Arnold's.

15:32.131 --> 15:35.032
See you, mateys.

15:35.134 --> 15:37.535
And you guys be careful.

15:37.637 --> 15:40.868
(spookily): There are strange
forces loose in the night.

15:40.973 --> 15:42.668
-(cackles)
-(thunder rumbles)

15:44.710 --> 15:46.769
- Come on. I need some help
with this. -All right.

15:46.879 --> 15:48.847
I got the sign
from my dad's place.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.973
Wait till you hear this, Rich.
Wait till you hear this.

15:51.083 --> 15:52.380
Go ahead, ask me: who is it?

15:52.485 --> 15:53.953
All right, who is it?

15:54.053 --> 15:56.249
It's Igor and Eye.
(laughing)

15:57.623 --> 15:59.717
Ralph, come on.
Have you got the fishing wire?

15:59.826 --> 16:00.987
Yeah, fishing wire.

16:01.093 --> 16:03.323
What are we gonna do,
hook us a ghost?

16:03.429 --> 16:04.863
No, it's all part of the plan.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.295
You see, we're gonna take
this stuff,

16:06.399 --> 16:07.730
we're gonna hook it
to the chandelier,

16:07.834 --> 16:09.529
then Potsie's gonna hide
behind the couch

16:09.635 --> 16:11.125
and operate
all the special effects.

16:11.237 --> 16:12.466
- Good.
- Yeah.

16:12.572 --> 16:14.472
-(knocking on door)
- Hah! The door.

16:14.574 --> 16:17.475
I'll get it
and scare his wits off.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.341
(growling)

16:19.445 --> 16:21.436
(screaming)

16:23.282 --> 16:25.182
Gotcha, Malph.

16:25.284 --> 16:27.184
(Ralph whimpering)

16:27.286 --> 16:28.685
- Potsie.
- Hey, Rich.

16:28.788 --> 16:30.222
Hey, that's great.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.018
Rich, Rich...

16:32.124 --> 16:35.719
I'm scared stiff.
Help me.

16:37.763 --> 16:38.662
(Ralph yelping)

16:38.764 --> 16:41.324
(banging at door)

16:41.434 --> 16:44.426
Don't ever leave me out there
like that.

16:52.111 --> 16:53.340
All right, Rich! Come on!

16:53.446 --> 16:54.675
RALPH:
Yeah, hurry up.

16:54.780 --> 16:55.679
RICHIE:
I'm coming!

16:55.781 --> 16:58.682
Aha!

16:58.784 --> 17:01.219
I'm Merlin the Magician.

17:01.320 --> 17:02.810
(chuckles)
Sorry I was late, guys.

17:02.922 --> 17:04.617
I was upstairs, uh,
sharpening my hat.

17:04.723 --> 17:06.192
(chuckles)

17:06.291 --> 17:08.852
You get it? Sharpening the...
(chuckles)

17:08.961 --> 17:11.055
Hey, come on, guys,
can't you cover this up?

17:11.163 --> 17:12.392
Yeah, we got a cover.

17:12.498 --> 17:15.092
The great Merlin doesn't
do magic on an old door.

17:15.201 --> 17:16.566
- All right. -POTSIE: Lift the
light. -RICHIE: All right.

17:16.669 --> 17:17.659
All right, now,
does everybody know

17:17.770 --> 17:18.703
what they're supposed
to be doing?

17:18.804 --> 17:19.828
Right.
You're the magician

17:19.939 --> 17:21.566
and I'm your assistant.

17:21.674 --> 17:23.039
And I do the hocus-pocus.

17:23.142 --> 17:24.973
That's right. Have you got
the phonograph and the records?

17:25.077 --> 17:26.567
- You bet.
- All right.

17:26.679 --> 17:28.841
Check this out, guys.
Check this out.

17:28.948 --> 17:30.507
Witches Top 20.
(chuckles)

17:30.616 --> 17:32.050
What do you think of this one?

17:32.151 --> 17:34.142
"Ghoul of My Dreams."

17:34.253 --> 17:35.414
(knocking on door)

17:35.521 --> 17:36.955
That's him. That's him.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.751
- That's Al. Get behind the sofa.
- Oh, okay, all right, all right.

17:38.858 --> 17:39.882
- All right, all right...
- All right, now-now...

17:39.992 --> 17:41.255
just remember--
got to play it up big.

17:41.360 --> 17:42.327
Oh, yeah... (loud grunting)

17:42.428 --> 17:43.793
- RICHIE: Not that big.
-(quieter grunt)

17:43.896 --> 17:46.058
We do have to convince him
that we're removing the curse.

17:46.165 --> 17:47.655
All right, get ready.
Get ready... you...

17:49.435 --> 17:51.335
-(thunder rumbling)
- Hi, Rich.

17:51.437 --> 17:53.428
Sharp hat.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.839
Oh, hi, Ralph.

17:57.944 --> 18:00.845
Well, I'm here.

18:00.947 --> 18:02.847
(whispers):
Curs-ed Al.

18:02.949 --> 18:05.680
Look at that.
It even hears whispers.

18:05.785 --> 18:08.846
I'd shake hands with you,
but I took safety precautions.

18:08.955 --> 18:11.185
Oh, look at that.

18:11.290 --> 18:15.124
Al, lie on the table.

18:15.227 --> 18:17.286
- Come on, lie on the table.
- Do you think it's gonna work?

18:17.396 --> 18:20.297
Of course it's gonna work.
Look, Fonzie got this ceremony

18:20.399 --> 18:22.629
out of the same book
that the witch got her...

18:22.735 --> 18:25.295
-you-know-what for you,
so it's got to work. -Okay.

18:25.404 --> 18:26.303
- Like this?
- Yes.

18:26.405 --> 18:27.304
- Just lie down?
- Yeah...

18:27.406 --> 18:28.635
- Okay, like that?
- Yeah.

18:28.741 --> 18:29.833
- Just... Here, I'm okay now?
- All right.

18:29.942 --> 18:32.001
- Oh, could I have some pillows?
- Oh.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.011
All right.

18:34.113 --> 18:37.276
Thank you, O helpful spirit.

18:38.684 --> 18:41.119
Oh, that's nice.

18:41.220 --> 18:42.984
- Al...
- Ah.

18:43.089 --> 18:45.922
We'll know that the evil
has been cast from your body

18:46.025 --> 18:48.050
when we see the Eye of Isis

18:48.160 --> 18:50.356
and the Bones of Zeus.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.227
Sam Zeus is dead?

18:52.331 --> 18:54.425
I just talked to him
this morning.

18:54.533 --> 18:56.558
Boy, you never know.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.159
Silence!

18:58.270 --> 19:01.865
And now to summon the spirits.

19:04.076 --> 19:07.239
Do I hear the "sir-een" call
of music?

19:07.346 --> 19:10.213
MAN: ♪ I came here to rock,
so let's get rollin'... ♪

19:10.316 --> 19:12.842
(record scratches)

19:12.952 --> 19:16.320
The flip side, O fiendish one!

19:16.422 --> 19:18.413
(eerie music playing)

19:22.962 --> 19:26.830
-(Al sighs heavily)
- I am calling on the spirits

19:26.932 --> 19:28.093
of darkness.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.100
(Al gasps)

19:30.202 --> 19:34.435
Gather, O spirits,
and help cast out the...

19:34.540 --> 19:38.841
you-know-what
from this pitiful hulk of a man.

19:38.944 --> 19:41.777
Yeah... yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:41.881 --> 19:43.679
Shh!

19:43.783 --> 19:47.242
Enter, spirits!

19:48.554 --> 19:50.921
(thunder rumbles)

19:51.023 --> 19:52.787
Holy moley.

19:52.892 --> 19:55.554
(chains rattling, banging)

19:55.661 --> 19:57.288
Thank you for coming.

19:58.230 --> 20:00.130
I think it's working!

20:00.232 --> 20:01.722
And now...

20:01.834 --> 20:04.769
I call on the Eye of Isis.

20:04.870 --> 20:08.568
Up, Isis. Up, Thetis.
Up, Medusa.

20:08.674 --> 20:11.974
I call on the Bones of Zeus.

20:12.078 --> 20:14.308
(thunder rumbling)

20:14.413 --> 20:16.575
Hear me, spirits.

20:16.682 --> 20:19.743
Arise... arise and cast out
this curse.

20:19.852 --> 20:21.877
Presto change-o! Rotten tomato!

20:21.987 --> 20:26.322
Arise and cast out the curse!

20:26.425 --> 20:28.519
It's working! I saw the eye!

20:28.627 --> 20:30.322
It's working!

20:30.429 --> 20:32.591
- It's working!
- It's working!

20:32.698 --> 20:35.258
Now he has seen the Eye of Isis.

20:35.367 --> 20:39.270
If only he could see
the Bones of Zeus.

20:39.371 --> 20:42.033
Welcome, O Bones of Zeus!

20:42.141 --> 20:45.338
(screaming)

20:45.444 --> 20:47.913
That Zeus is such a Potsie.

20:49.381 --> 20:50.280
I saw 'em.

20:50.382 --> 20:51.679
I think this is gonna work!

20:51.784 --> 20:53.616
I want to try my hand.

20:53.719 --> 20:54.618
I want to try my...

20:54.720 --> 20:58.816
(mimics eerie sound effects)

20:58.924 --> 21:00.187
(thunder rumbling)

21:00.292 --> 21:03.284
(cackling)

21:03.395 --> 21:05.625
(Ralph screaming)

21:05.731 --> 21:07.756
It's the... it's the witch!

21:07.867 --> 21:12.304
Who calls upon the spirits
of darkness?

21:12.404 --> 21:14.099
(thunder rumbling)

21:14.206 --> 21:19.667
Who dares to challenge
my powers of evil?

21:23.149 --> 21:25.811
Heyyy.

21:28.554 --> 21:31.785
You dare to interfere
with my curse?

21:31.891 --> 21:33.859
Let me tell you something, lady,
your curse is a lot of malarkey.

21:33.959 --> 21:34.858
(witch gasps)

21:34.960 --> 21:37.122
(makes zapping sound)

21:37.229 --> 21:38.663
Yeah, right. That's good.

21:38.764 --> 21:40.789
Hey, Al,

21:40.900 --> 21:43.335
is her curse full of malarkey?

21:43.435 --> 21:46.405
You got me, Fonz.

21:46.505 --> 21:47.404
Malarkey?!

21:47.506 --> 21:51.340
You will pay for your insolence!

21:51.443 --> 21:53.207
Oh, hey, uh,
I already did that, see?

21:53.312 --> 21:55.542
It's a very nice likeness,
isn't it?

21:55.648 --> 21:56.979
Cost me about 15 smackers,

21:57.082 --> 21:59.915
uh, ten for the jacket
alone-- whoo!

22:00.019 --> 22:02.181
Doubter!

22:02.288 --> 22:03.847
-(thunder rumbling)
- Disbeliever!

22:03.956 --> 22:05.515
Take this!

22:05.624 --> 22:09.083
(imitating crashing)

22:09.195 --> 22:11.892
Now all the way around!

22:11.997 --> 22:13.226
(imitating crashing)

22:13.332 --> 22:14.925
(cackles)

22:15.034 --> 22:17.264
Fonzie, what's going on?

22:18.304 --> 22:21.535
Oh, now take this!

22:21.640 --> 22:23.631
(yowling)

22:26.846 --> 22:28.439
That's the pits, lady!

22:28.547 --> 22:30.538
(cackles)

22:30.649 --> 22:34.517
Look, Fonzie,
this can't be happening!

22:36.088 --> 22:37.021
You're absolutely right.

22:37.122 --> 22:38.556
It ain't happening.

22:38.657 --> 22:40.455
The good...
the good fairy saved him!

22:40.559 --> 22:42.118
No, no, no, Ralph--
no good fairy,

22:42.228 --> 22:44.458
no magic, no witches.

22:44.563 --> 22:46.691
What we got here
is a wonderful old lady

22:46.799 --> 22:48.289
who's a little misguided,
you know?

22:48.801 --> 22:50.462
Oh! Magic!

22:50.569 --> 22:51.468
FONZIE:
Yeah, right.

22:51.570 --> 22:52.662
I know what you've got

22:52.771 --> 22:54.705
is the power of suggestion, huh?

22:54.807 --> 22:57.538
- OLD LADY: Listen, can I keep
the doll? -FONZIE: Sure.

22:57.643 --> 23:00.135
It's Halloween.
You know, it's my treat.

23:00.246 --> 23:03.739
Just a... little more respect
this time, all right?

23:03.849 --> 23:04.748
Look at that.

23:04.850 --> 23:06.750
Well, see, Delvecchio,

23:06.852 --> 23:10.254
all the time you thought it was
a curse, you did it yourself!

23:10.356 --> 23:11.915
(chuckles)
Lookit...

23:12.024 --> 23:14.254
-my hand, it's mine.
- Yeah.

23:14.360 --> 23:15.850
All right, all right, now-now,
do me a favor now.

23:15.961 --> 23:17.986
Just kiss and make up,
all right?

23:19.098 --> 23:21.624
- Oh, Fonz...
- FONZIE: All right.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.862
I understand.

23:23.969 --> 23:25.403
Shake and make up.

23:26.305 --> 23:27.204
(imitates zapping)

23:27.306 --> 23:29.866
(chuckles)
Kidding. Just kidding.

23:29.975 --> 23:31.807
Have a happy Halloween.

23:31.911 --> 23:35.438
- Happy Halloween!
- Aw, thanks to you, Fonz.
