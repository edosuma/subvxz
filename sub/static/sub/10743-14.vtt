            Hello, dear.
                           Oh.

14:04.043 --> 14:06.344
       Oh, I'm sorry, darling.
    Am I interrupting something?

Ladies Aid meeting.

I promise you, Alfred.

14:18.491 --> 14:19.490
Pleasure to meet you.

14:19.492 --> 14:20.958

Mrs. Bellows?

          you were married, sir.

14:36.743 --> 14:38.942
    How do you do, Mrs. Bellows.
      You have a fine husband.

14:40.113 --> 14:41.345

14:41.347 --> 14:42.647

                  your pardon.

14:58.131 --> 14:59.229
I want to talk to you.

14:59.231 --> 15:00.731
                Well, I'm rather
                 busy right now.

          an appointment, I'll--

15:02.635 --> 15:04.835

                   No.

15:13.913 --> 15:16.147
Oh. Well, that's
my mistake.

15:16.149 --> 15:18.749
Uh, can you tell me
where, uh, I might find him?

15:18.751 --> 15:20.517
                  Oh, sure.

15:20.519 --> 15:21.886
               He's right down
               the hall there.

pull yourself together?

Well, what happened to the last
autographed picture I gave you?

15:51.517 --> 15:53.317

           I gotta talk to you.

15:53.319 --> 15:54.619

     what urgent is.

   a cancellation on the 7th,

            to congratulate you.

             are picking you up

               to you for that.

                 about you.

                   she gets.

        a space shot Sunday.

in love with this girl, Evelyn?

Whatever her name is?

17:21.808 --> 17:23.272
           Of course I'm in love
                with Evelyn.

17:23.275 --> 17:25.443
   I'm in love with all of them:
       Agnes, Ann, Georgia...

with all of them.

                  what it is.

      loose in a candy store.

  the blame on anyone, major.

              just Mrs. Bellows.

18:04.149 --> 18:07.818

of my wife's infatuation,

to be here

on the same base.

               I agree with you,
                  sir. It's...

18:14.093 --> 18:16.427
I think it best
if one of us leaves.

  I wouldn't send my worst enemy

                  telling you

19:24.129 --> 19:25.496
                  that, uh,
             somehow, somewhere,

19:25.498 --> 19:27.498

Yes. And you were wrong,
were you not, master?

19:31.036 --> 19:32.470
                No, I were not.

19:32.472 --> 19:34.271

                 is the mafia,

              is the Aleutians.

      is going to have to marry
     this gangster's girlfriend.

19:42.582 --> 19:44.281
             Only he's not gonna
            be able to be there,

19:44.283 --> 19:46.784
  because Dr. Bellows is sending
   him to the Aleutian Islands.

get himself into these things?

                 gotta help him.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.827
I know. I will fix it
so that all women hate him.

19:56.829 --> 19:58.996
Then there will be no reason
for him to get married

19:58.998 --> 20:00.263
