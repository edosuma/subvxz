01:32.385 --> 01:34.679
Laura: MARY, WAIT UP!

01:34.846 --> 01:36.389
WAIT, MARY!

01:37.891 --> 01:40.769
WAIT. YOU SHOULD
HAVE WAITED.

01:40.935 --> 01:42.270
IT WON'T BE ANNOUNCED
TILL TOMORROW,

01:42.437 --> 01:44.731
BUT MISS BEADLE
PUT THE BEST ESSAY
UP ON THE BOARD.

01:44.898 --> 01:46.566
WELL, DON'T YOU EVEN CARE
WHOSE IT WAS?

01:46.733 --> 01:48.902
OH, YEAH.
I'M SORRY.
WHO WON?

01:49.068 --> 01:51.196
IT WAS YOURS,
YOU BIG SILLY.

01:51.362 --> 01:53.031
SAID RIGHT ON IT,
"BY MARY INGALLS."

01:53.198 --> 01:54.449
NELLIE OLESON WAS GREEN
WITH ENVY.

01:54.616 --> 01:55.617
SHE WAS SURE
SHE'D WIN.

01:55.784 --> 01:57.410
HER MOTHER WROTE IT
FOR HER, YOU KNOW,

01:57.577 --> 01:58.703
BUT I KNOW
YOURS WAS BETTER.

01:58.870 --> 02:00.538
YOU CAN WRITE AS GOOD
AS MISS BEADLE.

02:00.705 --> 02:02.415
Charles: HEY, EVERYBODY!

02:09.422 --> 02:11.424
HO!

02:11.591 --> 02:12.759
YOU LOVELY LADIES
LIKE A RIDE?

02:12.926 --> 02:14.969
SURE.
THANKS, PA.

02:15.136 --> 02:16.346
COME ON,
CARRIE. UP.

02:16.513 --> 02:18.056
HOW WAS SCHOOL TODAY,
CARRIE? ALL RIGHT?

02:18.223 --> 02:19.933
FINE.

02:21.935 --> 02:22.894
OH, BY THE WAY, MARY,

02:23.061 --> 02:25.647
UH, I GOT
A LETTER FOR YOU.

02:25.814 --> 02:27.482
IT'S FROM CHICAGO.

02:27.649 --> 02:30.193
CHICAGO?
IT'S FROM JOHN!

02:32.862 --> 02:34.364
WHAT'S HE SAY?

02:35.740 --> 02:37.492
WELL, AREN'T YOU GOING
TO READ IT TO US?

02:37.659 --> 02:40.119
I DON'T THINK THAT'S
A READING-ALOUD KIND
OF LETTER, HALF-PINT.

02:40.286 --> 02:42.539
JOHN'S LETTERS TO MARY
ARE KIND OF PERSONAL.

03:16.739 --> 03:17.574
CAROLINE!

03:17.740 --> 03:19.200
HI!

03:21.995 --> 03:23.663

03:27.333 --> 03:28.626
THANKS, MA.

03:28.793 --> 03:30.670
SHE DOESN'T SEEM
VERY EXCITED ABOUT IT.

03:30.837 --> 03:32.171

FROM CHICAGO.

03:32.338 --> 03:33.548
OH? HOW'S JOHN?

03:33.715 --> 03:35.633
WHO KNOWS? IT'S
STILL MARY'S SECRET.
OH.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.510
I HAVE
A LITTLE SECRET
OF MY OWN, TOO.

03:37.677 --> 03:39.012
OH? WHAT'S
YOUR SECRET?

HAS AN ANNOUNCEMENT
TO MAKE.

WELL, NOW, HOLD ON.
IT'S A FREE TRIP.

HOW WONDERFUL!

05:26.077 --> 05:26.911
YOU BET.

05:27.078 --> 05:28.246
IT SURE IS.

05:30.123 --> 05:31.374
BUT WHAT'S
A GRANGE?

05:31.541 --> 05:33.209
HONEY, THAT'S
AN ORGANIZATION

05:33.376 --> 05:34.460

AN AWFUL LOT OF GOOD

BOTHERING YOU?

05:43.052 --> 05:44.804
NO. I'M FINE.

05:44.971 --> 05:47.724
IT'S JUST THAT
SHE'S IN LOVE

05:47.890 --> 05:48.975
AND MISERABLE
BECAUSE SHE
CAN'T GO

05:49.142 --> 05:51.227
TO THE DANCE
WITH JOHN.

05:51.394 --> 05:55.064
IT'S NOT JUST THE DANCE.

05:55.231 --> 05:57.692
I MISS HIM SO MUCH.

05:57.859 --> 05:58.985
IT'S BEEN SO LONG.

05:59.152 --> 06:02.030
WELL,
YOU JUST MIGHT BE
INTERESTED TO KNOW

06:02.196 --> 06:03.948
THAT THE CONVENTION
THAT YOUR MA AND I
ARE GOING TO

06:04.115 --> 06:05.783
IS GOING TO
TAKE PLACE
IN CHICAGO.

06:08.536 --> 06:09.620
THAT'S RIGHT.

06:09.787 --> 06:10.705
THEN YOU'LL SEE JOHN.

06:10.872 --> 06:11.664
WELL,
OF COURSE WE WILL.

06:11.831 --> 06:12.707
YOU CAN TELL ME
EVERYTHING--

06:12.874 --> 06:13.750
WHERE HE LIVES,
HOW HE LOOKS,

06:13.916 --> 06:14.792
IF HE'S CHANGED AT ALL.

06:14.959 --> 06:16.044
WE'LL TELL YOU
EVERYTHING.

06:16.210 --> 06:18.212
THE SHIRT! THE ONE
I MADE HIM FOR CHRISTMAS

06:18.379 --> 06:19.505
WHEN HE WAS SUPPOSED
TO COME HOME.

06:19.672 --> 06:21.007
I WAS GOING TO SEND IT
TO HIM BY MAIL,

06:21.174 --> 06:22.425
BUT--BUT NOW
YOU CAN TAKE IT
TO HIM IN PERSON.

06:22.592 --> 06:24.177
WELL, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO GET IT NOW.

06:24.343 --> 06:26.012
WELL, THERE'S
SO MANY THINGS
I WANT YOU TO TELL HIM,

06:26.179 --> 06:27.847
THINGS I CAN'T FIT
IN A LETTER.

06:28.014 --> 06:31.142
IT'LL BE ALMOST AS IF
I WAS REALLY THERE.

06:37.356 --> 06:39.108
CHARLES, I NEED
TO TALK TO YOU.

06:39.275 --> 06:40.860
SURE.
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

06:41.027 --> 06:42.862
NO. I-IT'S
ABOUT CHICAGO.

06:43.029 --> 06:43.863
I THINK I SHOULD
STAY HERE.

06:44.030 --> 06:45.073
OH, NOW, CAROLINE,
COME ON.

06:45.239 --> 06:46.365
IF IT'S BECAUSE
OF THE CHILDREN--

06:46.532 --> 06:48.034
NO, IT ISN'T.

06:48.201 --> 06:49.702
AT LEAST,
NOT THE WAY
YOU'RE THINKING.

06:49.869 --> 06:51.204
WELL, WHY WOULDN'T YOU
WANT TO GO?

06:51.370 --> 06:52.705
WE'LL NEVER HAVE
A CHANCE LIKE THIS AGAIN.

06:52.872 --> 06:56.125
I DON'T MEAN
TO SEEM UNGRATEFUL.

06:56.292 --> 06:58.878
OH, I'D LOVE
TO SEE CHICAGO,

06:59.045 --> 07:00.129
BUT IT WOULD BE
SEEING IT WITH YOU

07:00.296 --> 07:02.048
THAT WOULD MAKE IT
SO SPECIAL.

07:02.215 --> 07:04.175
ISN'T THAT WHY
YOU INVITED ME?

07:04.342 --> 07:05.176
OF COURSE IT IS.

07:05.343 --> 07:08.596
I WANT MARY
TO MAKE THE TRIP.

07:08.763 --> 07:11.724
I CAN SEE CHICAGO ON
A PICTURE POSTCARD.

07:13.893 --> 07:15.228
IT MEANS
THAT MUCH TO YOU?

07:15.394 --> 07:17.730
AND TO HER.

07:17.897 --> 07:18.898
NOTHING'S
MORE IMPORTANT

07:19.065 --> 07:20.399
THAN BEING WITH
THE ONE YOU LOVE.

07:22.401 --> 07:23.736
DON'T I KNOW THAT.

07:26.948 --> 07:30.576
IT'LL BE WORTH IT
JUST TO SEE HER FACE
WHEN I TELL HER.

07:30.743 --> 07:31.911
WELL, THEN WHAT
ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

07:32.078 --> 07:34.038
WHY DON'T YOU
GO TELL HER?

07:34.205 --> 07:35.998
THANK YOU.

07:36.165 --> 07:38.084
CAROLINE?
HUH?

07:38.251 --> 07:40.920
I REALLY DO LOVE YOU.

07:44.423 --> 07:48.010
MARY, WOULD YOU COME
DOWN HERE, PLEASE?

08:02.984 --> 08:05.153
NEED SOME HELP?

08:06.195 --> 08:08.447
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

08:08.614 --> 08:10.741
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

08:11.784 --> 08:14.370
OH, I REMEMBER
THE FIRST TIME
I WORE IT.

08:14.537 --> 08:16.122
I WAS
ABOUT YOUR AGE.

08:16.289 --> 08:18.124
YOUR PA AND I WERE
NOT YET MARRIED.

08:18.291 --> 08:20.960
WE HARDLY EVEN
KNEW EACH OTHER.

08:23.504 --> 08:25.590
HE WAS
SO HANDSOME...

08:27.175 --> 08:29.510
AND I WAS
SO YOUNG...

08:31.179 --> 08:33.139
PAINFULLY SHY.

08:38.311 --> 08:39.145
HE AND FATHER
WERE STANDING

08:39.312 --> 08:41.981
BY THE FIREPLACE
TALKING...

08:44.275 --> 08:46.736
AND I CAME IN...

08:46.903 --> 08:48.404
WEARING
THIS DRESS...

08:49.405 --> 08:52.158
AND HE LOOKED AT ME
AND SAID,

08:52.325 --> 08:56.120
"CAROLINE...

08:56.287 --> 08:57.663
"YOU ARE
THE PRETTIEST THING

08:57.830 --> 08:59.540

OF HEAVEN."

09:02.418 --> 09:04.337
IT WAS
A SPRING DANCE--

09:04.503 --> 09:06.756
MAY, I THINK.

09:06.923 --> 09:08.758
HE BROUGHT ME
CORNFLOWERS
FROM THE MEADOW,

09:08.925 --> 09:11.052
AND I PUT THEM
IN MY HAIR.

09:11.219 --> 09:14.430
OH, I FELL
IN LOVE WITH HIM
THAT MOMENT...

09:16.390 --> 09:18.476
AND I'VE LOVED HIM
EVER SINCE.

09:23.898 --> 09:24.690

09:30.363 --> 09:33.407

FOR SOMETHING
REALLY SPECIAL.

09:35.868 --> 09:36.869
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TRY IT ON,

09:37.036 --> 09:39.038
SEE IF IT NEEDS
ANY ADJUSTING.

09:40.039 --> 09:43.125
BUT WHY ARE YOU
GIVING IT TO ME?

09:43.292 --> 09:46.212
YOU'RE GOING TO
NEED SOMETHING NICE
FOR THE COTILLION.

09:49.423 --> 09:50.758
WELL, DON'T JUST
STAND THERE.

09:50.925 --> 09:52.051

OF WORK TO DO

09:52.218 --> 09:55.346

13:08.581 --> 13:10.082
THERE YOU ARE,
SWEETHEART.

13:10.249 --> 13:11.584
COME ALONG, RODNEY.
COME ALONG.

13:11.750 --> 13:13.878
DON'T DRAG YOUR FEET,
DARLING. COME ALONG.

13:14.044 --> 13:16.714
DOWN THE STEP.
THAT'S A GOOD BOY.

13:16.881 --> 13:19.675
HERE WE GO, BABY.
COME ALONG.

13:19.842 --> 13:21.969
PA, DID YOU SEE THAT?

13:22.136 --> 13:23.387
WHAT'S THAT, HONEY?

13:23.554 --> 13:25.222
THAT DOG.
IT HAS A COAT ON.

13:25.389 --> 13:27.099
HA HA HA!

13:27.266 --> 13:29.602
I DON'T THINK
BANDIT WOULD PUT UP
WITH THAT, WOULD HE?

13:29.768 --> 13:31.937
NO.

13:32.104 --> 13:33.314
YOUR
BAGGAGE,
SIR.

13:33.481 --> 13:36.108
OF COURSE
IT'S MY BAGGAGE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

13:36.275 --> 13:37.776
COME ON, HONEY.

13:42.156 --> 13:43.657
ANOTHER FARMER.

13:49.955 --> 13:51.624
Man: GOOD AFTERNOON, SIR.
MAY I HELP YOU?

13:51.790 --> 13:53.709
YEAH. I'D LIKE
TWO ROOMS, PLEASE.

13:53.876 --> 13:55.586
IF YOU WOULD SIGN
THE REGISTER, SIR.

13:55.753 --> 13:57.838
ALL RIGHT.

14:00.466 --> 14:02.301
AH, YES. MR. INGALLS.

14:02.468 --> 14:05.471
MR. CHARLES INGALLS,

14:05.638 --> 14:07.056

14:07.223 --> 14:08.349
YEAH. THAT'S RIGHT.

14:09.767 --> 14:10.935
FRONT.

14:11.101 --> 14:13.521
UH, JUST A MINUTE.
I DIDN'T MAKE
A RESERVATION.

14:13.687 --> 14:15.314
A RESERVATION
IS NOT REQUIRED.

14:15.481 --> 14:17.650
YOUR ACCOMMODATIONS
ARE PAID IN FULL.

14:17.816 --> 14:19.485

14:19.652 --> 14:21.278
ENJOY YOUR STAY,

14:24.156 --> 14:25.866
MAY I HELP YOU, SIR?

14:30.788 --> 14:32.623
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE
WELCOME.

14:33.624 --> 14:36.210
OH, PA!

14:48.430 --> 14:49.265
WHERE'S THE BED?

14:49.431 --> 14:50.849
YOUR ROOM'S
OVER HERE, MISS.

14:57.648 --> 14:59.942
I NEVER HAD
MY OWN ROOM
BEFORE.

15:00.109 --> 15:02.361
AND THE BATHROOM
IS THROUGH THERE.

15:02.528 --> 15:04.530
YOUR ROOM
IS THIS WAY, SIR.

15:04.697 --> 15:06.657
OH. THANK YOU.

15:10.995 --> 15:12.329
THESE ROOMS
ARE VERY NICE,

15:12.496 --> 15:14.164
BUT, UH, ARE YOU SURE
THEY'RE THE RIGHT ONES?

15:14.331 --> 15:16.208
OH, YES, SIR.
SUITE 232.

15:16.375 --> 15:18.335
IF I CAN BE
OF SERVICE, THE CORD
BY THE FIREPLACE

15:18.502 --> 15:20.462
WILL SIGNAL ME
DOWN IN THE LOBBY.

15:20.629 --> 15:22.548
OH. THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.

15:22.715 --> 15:24.508
YOU'RE WELCOME.

15:33.726 --> 15:35.185
I KNEW CHICAGO
WOULD BE WONDERFUL,

15:35.352 --> 15:36.478
BUT I NEVER
EXPECTED THIS.

15:36.645 --> 15:38.063
WELL, NEITHER DID I.

15:38.230 --> 15:40.899
PRIVATE COMPARTMENT
ON THE TRAIN,
BIG SUITE OF ROOMS.

15:41.066 --> 15:43.360
LUTHER DOUGLAS
NEVER SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT THIS.

15:44.945 --> 15:47.031
PA, WHEN
CAN I SEE JOHN?

15:47.197 --> 15:49.617
HOW DOES 5 MINUTES SOUND?
JUST ENOUGH TIME FOR US
TO FRESHEN UP.

15:49.783 --> 15:50.659
SOUNDS GREAT!

15:50.826 --> 15:52.911
HA HA HA!

16:05.883 --> 16:07.593
THIS IS IT.

16:09.678 --> 16:11.930
THIS IS
WHERE HE WORKS.

16:12.097 --> 16:13.891
JUST THINK
OF IT, PA--

16:14.058 --> 16:16.310
JOHN WORKING
FOR A BIG NEWSPAPER
LIKE THIS.

16:16.477 --> 16:18.270

NICE TO SEE YOU,
SIR.

16:42.127 --> 16:43.337
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

16:43.504 --> 16:44.838
Man: SANDERSON, AREN'T
YOU SUPPOSED TO BE DOING

16:45.005 --> 16:45.964
THAT MUSIC-FESTIVAL
ARTICLE?

16:46.131 --> 16:47.091
MR. HANCOCK,

16:47.257 --> 16:49.635
THIS IS MARY

INGALLS.

16:49.802 --> 16:52.471
WELL, I'LL BE.
HOW DO YOU DO,
MR. INGALLS?

16:52.638 --> 16:53.764
MR. HANCOCK.

16:53.931 --> 16:56.725
MARY. I FEEL LIKE I'VE
KNOWN YOU FOLKS FOR YEARS.

16:56.892 --> 16:58.977
WHAT BRINGS YOU
TO CHICAGO?

16:59.144 --> 16:59.978
I CAME
TO SEE JOHN.

17:00.145 --> 17:01.563
OH, NATURALLY.

17:01.730 --> 17:04.566
YOU WERE RIGHT, JOHN.
SHE'S LOVELY.

17:04.733 --> 17:07.361
I'M HERE
REPRESENTING MY DISTRICT
FOR THE GRANGE CONVENTION,

17:07.528 --> 17:09.488
WHICH REMINDS ME
I REALLY SHOULD
BE ON MY WAY.

17:09.655 --> 17:10.656
MR. HANCOCK,
IT WAS A PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU.

17:10.823 --> 17:12.282
MAYBE WE CAN TALK
AGAIN SOMETIME.

17:12.449 --> 17:13.826
JOHN, YOU'LL
TAKE MARY BACK
TO THE HOTEL, RIGHT?

17:13.992 --> 17:14.952
OF COURSE, SIR.
GOOD TO SEE
YOU AGAIN.

17:15.119 --> 17:16.286
I HAVE AN IDEA.

17:16.453 --> 17:17.663
MR. INGALLS, WHY DON'T
YOU AND YOUR DAUGHTER

17:17.830 --> 17:18.706
JOIN ME

17:18.872 --> 17:21.500
UH, YOU, TOO, JOHN,
OF COURSE.

17:21.667 --> 17:23.168
COULD WE, PA?

17:23.335 --> 17:25.421
THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU.
WE'D APPRECIATE IT.

17:25.587 --> 17:26.505
THANK YOU, MR. HANCOCK.

17:26.672 --> 17:27.506
FLETCHER.

17:27.673 --> 17:28.966
FLETCHER. I REALLY
SHOULD BE GOING.

17:29.133 --> 17:30.676
IF YOU COULD
JUST POINT ME
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

17:30.843 --> 17:32.469
I'LL DO BETTER THAN THAT.
I'M HEADING IN THE SAME WAY.

17:32.636 --> 17:34.680
I APPRECIATE IT.
JOHN, WE'LL SEE YOU
TONIGHT.

17:34.847 --> 17:36.056
THIS YOUR FIRST TRIP
TO CHICAGO, CHARLES?

17:36.223 --> 17:37.099
YES, IT IS.

17:37.266 --> 17:38.475
WELL, I THINK
YOU'LL LIKE IT

17:38.642 --> 17:40.769
IF YOU GET A CHANCE
TO LOOK AROUND.

17:40.936 --> 17:43.355
OH, I HAVE
MISSED YOU, JOHN.

17:43.522 --> 17:44.857
AND I'VE MISSED YOU.

17:45.023 --> 17:46.692
OH, I ALMOST FORGOT.

17:46.859 --> 17:48.736
THIS IS FOR YOU.
I HOPE YOU LIKE IT.

17:48.902 --> 17:51.113
IT'S FROM YOU.
I'LL LIKE IT.

17:51.280 --> 17:53.157
HEY, HOW ABOUT
SEEING WHERE I WORK?

18:17.556 --> 18:18.599
WHEW!

18:18.766 --> 18:20.017
IT'S REALLY A BIG PLACE
THEY GOT HERE, HUH?

18:20.184 --> 18:22.770
YEAH.
I SUPPOSE IT IS.

18:22.936 --> 18:25.105
ENNIS O'CONNELL.
BLOOMINGTON,
ILLINOIS.

18:25.272 --> 18:26.815
CHARLES INGALLS.
WALNUT GROVE, MINNESOTA.

18:26.982 --> 18:29.401
IT'S MY FIRST TIME
IN CHICAGO.
IT'S QUITE A TOWN.

18:29.568 --> 18:31.737
YEAH. IT LOOKS
A LOT BETTER
SINCE THEY REBUILT

18:31.904 --> 18:33.906
AFTER THE FIRE
IN '71.

18:34.072 --> 18:35.240
SEE, MY PLACE
ISN'T TOO FAR,

18:35.407 --> 18:36.658
AND I'M ON THE MAIN
RAILROAD LINE,

18:36.825 --> 18:38.786
SO I GET HERE
PRETTY REGULAR.

18:38.952 --> 18:41.246
WHERE--WHERE'D
YOU SAY YOU'RE FROM?

18:41.413 --> 18:43.248
OH, WALNUT GROVE.
IT'S A REAL SMALL TOWN.

18:43.415 --> 18:45.083
IT'S ABOUT 3 DAYS
OUTSIDE OF MANKATO.

18:45.250 --> 18:46.543
YOU MEAN,
THAT'S YOUR NEAREST
RAILROAD STOP?

18:46.710 --> 18:47.961
NO, NO. SPRINGFIELD'S
THE NEAREST ONE,

18:48.128 --> 18:50.005
BUT THERE'S
NO GRAIN ELEVATOR THERE.

18:50.172 --> 18:51.715
IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS
I'M HOPING TO TALK ABOUT
HERE AT THE CONVENTION.

18:51.882 --> 18:52.758
Man: GENTLEMEN!

18:52.925 --> 18:55.219
TAKE YOUR SEATS, PLEASE!

18:55.385 --> 18:57.221

LET'S COME TO ORDER,
PLEASE.

19:25.499 --> 19:26.291
MISS ANYTHING?

19:26.458 --> 19:28.126
NO, NO.
JUST GETTING STARTED.

19:29.044 --> 19:31.839
GENTLEMEN.

19:32.005 --> 19:34.299
HERE WE GO.

19:34.466 --> 19:35.843

19:37.970 --> 19:41.181
MEMBERS OF THE GRANGE...

19:41.348 --> 19:44.643
IT IS MY PLEASURE
TO WELCOME YOU TO CHICAGO.

19:44.810 --> 19:46.770
ALL RIGHT. NOW,
LET'S HEAR IT FROM YOU.

19:46.937 --> 19:48.981
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT THE GRANGE?

19:49.147 --> 19:51.275
[CHEERING AND WHISTLING]

20:10.085 --> 20:12.629
Mary: AND TOMORROW
JOHN'S GOING TO SHOW
ME AROUND THE CITY.

20:12.796 --> 20:14.840
Fletcher:
YOU'RE NOT GOING OVER
TO THE UNIVERSITY?

20:15.007 --> 20:16.592
THERE'S REALLY
NOTHING MUCH TO SEE,

20:16.758 --> 20:17.676
JUST A LOT OF BUILDINGS.

20:17.843 --> 20:18.927
WE SPENT
THE WHOLE AFTERNOON

20:19.094 --> 20:20.095
WORKING
ON HIS ARTICLE.

20:20.262 --> 20:21.597
HE EVEN LET ME
WRITE PART OF IT.

20:21.763 --> 20:23.599
WE'VE GOT TO REMEMBER
TO TAKE A COPY BACK WITH US.

20:23.765 --> 20:25.517
I'M SURE
YOU WON'T FORGET.

20:25.684 --> 20:26.894
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN BACK
TO WALNUT GROVE, JOHN.

20:27.060 --> 20:28.270
YOU GONNA COME SEE US
THIS SUMMER

20:28.437 --> 20:29.730
OR GO OUT TO CALIFORNIA
TO SEE YOUR FOLKS?

20:29.897 --> 20:31.815
I DON'T KNOW, SIR.

20:31.982 --> 20:34.985
WITH WORK,
IT MAY BE DIFFICULT
TO GET AWAY AT ALL.

20:35.152 --> 20:36.778
WELL, YOU NEED
SOME TIME OFF, JOHN,

20:36.945 --> 20:38.071
JUST LET ME KNOW.

20:38.238 --> 20:40.699
YOU HAVE TO.
YOU DIDN'T COME
AT CHRISTMAS.

20:40.866 --> 20:42.826
I EXPLAINED ABOUT THAT.
I HAD EXAMS.

20:42.993 --> 20:44.786
Charles: WELL, NOBODY'S
GONNA RECOGNIZE YOU

20:44.953 --> 20:46.204
BY THE TIME
THEY SET EYES ON YOU.

20:46.371 --> 20:47.331
I SUPPOSED.

20:47.497 --> 20:49.958
YOU NOTICE ANY DIFFERENCE
IN MARY?

20:51.627 --> 20:54.755
OH, NO, SHE'S
EXACTLY THE SAME AS
WHEN WE GOT ENGAGED.

20:54.922 --> 20:56.173
I GREW A WHOLE INCH
SINCE THEN.

20:56.340 --> 20:57.591
Fletcher: HA HA!

20:57.758 --> 21:00.552
I'M SORRY.
I COULDN'T
REALLY TELL.

21:00.719 --> 21:01.887
WAIT TILL YOU DANCE WITH ME
AT THE COTILLION.

21:02.054 --> 21:03.096
THEN YOU'LL SEE.

21:03.263 --> 21:04.806
FLETCHER, THIS WAS
A DELICIOUS DINNER.

21:04.973 --> 21:06.683
WELL, I'M RIGHT GLAD
YOU ENJOYED IT.

21:06.850 --> 21:09.561
BUT I HOPE YOU LEFT SPACE
FOR DESSERT.

21:09.728 --> 21:12.856
THEY BAKE A PIE HERE
MADE OF PECAN NUTS

21:13.023 --> 21:15.400
SHIPPED ALL THE WAY
FROM THE STATE OF GEORGIA.

21:15.567 --> 21:16.443
John: SO WHAT DO YOU
THINK OF CHICAGO?

21:16.610 --> 21:17.694
Mary: IT'S SO BIG!

21:17.861 --> 21:19.571
WALNUT GROVE IS LIKE
A PARK NEXT TO IT.

21:19.738 --> 21:20.989
IT'S REALLY AMAZING.

21:21.156 --> 21:23.742
REALLY.

21:32.960 --> 21:34.962
TWO OF THESE,
PLEASE.

21:36.004 --> 21:38.799
HERE YOU GO.
THANK YOU.

21:38.966 --> 21:39.883
HERE.

21:40.050 --> 21:40.926
WHAT IS IT?

21:41.093 --> 21:42.511
IT'S CALLED
CHEWING GUM.

21:42.678 --> 21:43.929
THEY JUST STARTED
MAKING IT A COUPLE
OF YEARS AGO.

21:44.096 --> 21:45.389
WELL, WHAT DO YOU
DO WITH IT?

21:45.555 --> 21:47.391
WELL, LIKE IT SAYS,
YOU CHEW IT.

21:47.557 --> 21:50.519
OH.

21:50.686 --> 21:51.937
BUT DON'T
SWALLOW IT.

21:52.104 --> 21:53.522
WHY NOT?
IS IT POISONOUS?

21:53.689 --> 21:56.733
OF COURSE NOT, BUT
IT'S CHEWING GUM,
NOT EATING GUM.

21:56.900 --> 22:00.362
ANYWAY,
IT'S DELICIOUS.
GO ON.

22:00.529 --> 22:01.947
MMM! IT IS GOOD.

22:02.114 --> 22:04.658
I OUGHT TO TAKE SOME
BACK TO LAURA.
SHE'LL LOVE IT.

22:06.284 --> 22:07.786
SANDERSON.

22:07.953 --> 22:10.706
I DIDN'T EXPECT
TO SEE YOU IN TOWN.

22:10.872 --> 22:13.500
GLAD I CAUGHT YOU.
I HAVE YOUR ANTHROPOLOGY NOTES.

22:13.667 --> 22:14.960
OH, THANKS.
I ALMOST FORGOT
ABOUT THEM.

22:15.127 --> 22:16.128
WHO'S THE PRETTY LADY?

22:16.294 --> 22:18.255
OH. WESLEY COX, THIS
IS MARY INGALLS.

22:18.422 --> 22:19.464
YOU MUST BE A NEW STUDENT.

22:19.631 --> 22:20.966
I'D NEVER FORGET
SUCH A SWEET FACE.

22:21.133 --> 22:23.135
OH, I DON'T GO
TO COLLEGE.

22:23.301 --> 22:25.262
THIS IS MARY INGALLS

I'M GOING TO
HAVE TO TAKE YOU
BACK TO THE HOTEL.

22:38.900 --> 22:40.068
UH, NO NEED FOR THAT.

22:40.235 --> 22:42.029
I'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY
TO ESCORT MARY FOR YOU.

22:42.195 --> 22:44.031
WOULD YOU?
OF COURSE.

22:44.197 --> 22:46.324
OH. I'M SORRY
TO HAVE TO RUSH OFF
LIKE THIS, MARY.

22:46.491 --> 22:48.243
WILL I SEE YOU
AFTER YOUR APPOINTMENT?

22:48.410 --> 22:50.037
YEAH. AT ABOUT,

I KNOW. WE MET,
BUT WHEN I READ
THIS ARTICLE--

28:58.238 --> 28:59.197
ARE YOU TRYING
TO TELL ME

HOW MY REPORTERS
SHOULD WRITE?

HAPPENED THIS WAY.

I MEAN, DRUNKEN FARMERS,
FANCY WOMEN.

29:10.125 --> 29:12.669

THE BARGAINING GOING ON
UNDER THE TABLE.

29:12.836 --> 29:16.840

MAKING DEALS, BRIBES,
AND WITH RAILROADS.

29:17.006 --> 29:19.050

WAS A NIGHTMARE.

ABOUT IT IN HERE.

TO SAY IS IMPORTANT

PAYING ME TO SAY IT.

PROUD TO BE A MEMBER
OF THE GRANGE.

WHEN I WAS ASKED

37:26.412 --> 37:29.624
TO REPRESENT
MY DISTRICT HERE
AT THE CONVENTION.

37:29.790 --> 37:33.169

ISN'T THE GRANGE

RURAL ORGANIZATION

37:35.546 --> 37:37.173
THAT IT USED
TO BE...

37:39.091 --> 37:40.885
BECAUSE
IT'S BEEN CORRUPTED
BY THE RAILROADS

37:41.052 --> 37:42.553
AND THE POWER
OF THE BIG CITIES.

37:42.720 --> 37:44.472

A LIBELOUS STATEMENT.

TO YOU, O'CONNELL?
IT'S NOTHING.

A LOT TO ME,

RATHER LOSE MY FARM
THAN LOSE MY HONOR.

THIS CONVENTION'S TIME.

WITH MR. O'CONNELL,

A WASTE OF THIS

WHY WASTE YOUR TIME

SO MUCH MORE MONEY
BY BEING DISHONEST?

LIKE A FOOL.

HOW THE REST OF YOU
