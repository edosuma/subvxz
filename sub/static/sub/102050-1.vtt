00:17.225 --> 00:21.430
<i>He can be saved by the bell
in the last round. Eight seconds left!</i>

00:21.463 --> 00:24.734
<i>Just so many
right hands one man can take.</i>

00:27.636 --> 00:29.504
<i>It's a bloodbath.</i>

00:29.538 --> 00:32.340
<i>He may think he has him.</i>

00:34.811 --> 00:38.081
- <i>Wow!</i>
- <i>He's not getting up, Jake! He's not getting up!</i>

00:38.114 --> 00:40.615
<i>No! He's been knocked out.</i>

00:40.649 --> 00:42.018
<i>Incredible!</i>

00:42.051 --> 00:46.789
<i>A sensational right hand K.O.
of the undefeated champion!</i>

00:46.823 --> 00:48.891
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

01:28.731 --> 01:30.499
Let's look alive,
gentlemen.

01:30.532 --> 01:33.335
They pay the bills,
so be polite.

01:33.368 --> 01:35.403
10-4.

01:35.437 --> 01:37.539
- Whatever.
- Copy that.

04:37.887 --> 04:39.454
I owe you a drink.

04:43.092 --> 04:44.160
You don't.

04:46.528 --> 04:47.930
I could use one.

04:56.772 --> 04:58.240
You want ice or something?

05:01.344 --> 05:02.845
I'm okay.

05:13.189 --> 05:14.556
Do you want a job?

05:16.926 --> 05:17.927
What kind of job?

05:19.862 --> 05:20.963
A fun one.

05:22.264 --> 05:23.265
What do I gotta do?

05:26.435 --> 05:27.635
Protect me.

05:29.537 --> 05:31.207
From who?

05:31.240 --> 05:32.942
Only my adoring fans.

05:37.046 --> 05:38.781
Forty-five an hour okay?

05:41.017 --> 05:42.251
Forty.

05:42.284 --> 05:43.886
Call me so I have your number.

05:45.620 --> 05:47.790
Nomi. That's your name?

05:47.823 --> 05:49.091
What kind of name is that?

05:52.228 --> 05:53.696
What kind of phone is that?

05:54.897 --> 05:56.866
I'll text you
when I need you, okay?

05:58.000 --> 05:59.201
Okay.

06:00.736 --> 06:02.071
Or you can call me.

06:03.506 --> 06:04.572
Why would I do that?

06:04.606 --> 06:06.876
I don't know...
Maybe you get lonely.

06:07.977 --> 06:08.978
I do.

06:44.579 --> 06:46.282
My daughter is still undefeated.

06:49.118 --> 06:51.287
My... My oldest,
remember I told you about her?

06:53.289 --> 06:54.690
You must be proud.

06:55.623 --> 06:57.693
She's a winner,
like her old man.

06:58.626 --> 06:59.795
<i>Salud.</i>

07:03.532 --> 07:05.201
But you know, her weight class,

07:05.234 --> 07:08.737
most of the boys don't even have
hair on their coin purses yet.

07:09.171 --> 07:10.473
But still...

07:10.506 --> 07:13.109
Three years undefeated,
boy, girl, nobody.

07:14.609 --> 07:16.679
High school wrestling,
of all things.

07:19.482 --> 07:21.917
You know, uh,

07:21.951 --> 07:25.688
the guy you worked up,
he's not a friend of mine.

07:25.721 --> 07:28.691
But he's a friend
of this place. So...

07:29.825 --> 07:31.994
We gotta part company.

07:32.027 --> 07:33.829
Professionally speaking,
that is.

07:34.363 --> 07:35.663
It's your severance.

07:38.701 --> 07:41.103
I respect you.

07:41.137 --> 07:43.772
That's why we're having
this drink, you understand?

07:46.609 --> 07:48.711
I bet you she loses.

07:50.279 --> 07:52.815
That's a tough bet.

07:52.848 --> 07:54.316
That's a tough bet.

07:54.350 --> 07:55.918
I got one for you.

07:55.951 --> 07:57.786
I bet you never fight
in the ring again.

08:02.892 --> 08:04.793
What about that?
You'd take that bet?

08:06.595 --> 08:08.731
Let me know when you
lace 'em up again, kid.

08:09.398 --> 08:11.167
You used to be something to see.

08:14.203 --> 08:15.771
Yo, Nick.

08:15.804 --> 08:17.907
Hey, don't forget
about Thailand in December.

08:17.940 --> 08:20.309
- He ain't coming.
- It's a shame.

08:53.976 --> 08:57.613
Come on.
You're better than that, Max.

09:00.749 --> 09:01.884
Help, Uncle Nicky.

09:01.917 --> 09:04.119
Please, help. Please, help.

09:14.797 --> 09:17.666
All right, ladies. Breakfast.

09:17.701 --> 09:19.902
- Who wants juice?
- Me.

09:21.770 --> 09:23.105
All right.

09:26.909 --> 09:29.378
Maybe you should take some time
before you, uh,

09:29.411 --> 09:31.313
jump on to another night crew.

09:31.914 --> 09:33.115
Get back in the gym, even.

09:35.551 --> 09:37.286
To teach, I didn't say fight.

09:38.454 --> 09:40.089
I got nothing to prove.

09:40.789 --> 09:41.991
I know you don't...

09:43.092 --> 09:44.093
Do you?

10:33.909 --> 10:34.943
Oh, karaoke.

10:34.977 --> 10:37.146
I don't like karaoke.

10:37.413 --> 10:38.715
Why?

10:38.748 --> 10:41.850
- We hate it.
- It's the worst.

10:41.884 --> 10:43.753
Although you sang
a lot of Sade.

10:43.787 --> 10:45.789
I always get everyone
so depressed.

10:45.821 --> 10:48.424
Like, I'm the worst
to take to karaoke.

10:49.693 --> 10:51.960
- I'll see you. Call me.
- Yeah, I'll message you, yeah.

10:51.994 --> 10:53.395
- Bye.
- Bye.

11:00.969 --> 11:04.306
Are you gonna stalk me like some creep,
or walk with me like a gentleman?

11:22.826 --> 11:25.260
- Fuck that motherfucker.
- I know.

11:26.528 --> 11:28.130
Aw, beautiful.

11:28.597 --> 11:30.032
Mmm. Look at this.

11:30.065 --> 11:32.034
- Wow, marry me.
- Oh shit, sweetie!

11:32.067 --> 11:33.235
Let me have your phone number.

11:33.268 --> 11:34.870
Aren't you gonna say something?

11:35.571 --> 11:36.872
They're harmless.

11:37.272 --> 11:38.340
I guess.

11:39.074 --> 11:40.442
You're hurting me.

11:40.476 --> 11:43.412
I-I'm coming from a place of
love, why do you gotta hate?

11:44.546 --> 11:47.082
- Shh!
- I'm just... I'm trying to show my love.

11:47.116 --> 11:49.618
What is it you think
I do, exactly?

11:49.651 --> 11:51.120
I don't know, some type of art.

11:52.822 --> 11:54.923
- Where are you from?
- The Bronx.

11:54.957 --> 11:56.826
Ah yes, I figured that.

11:56.860 --> 11:58.127
You from around here?

11:58.160 --> 12:00.429
I am from far, far away.

12:00.896 --> 12:02.097
Bay Ridge.

12:02.766 --> 12:04.333
A Nuyorican.

12:07.636 --> 12:09.671
You know that guy you beat up
in the club the other night?

12:11.940 --> 12:13.208
What about him?

12:13.242 --> 12:14.943
He wasn't my boyfriend
or anything.

12:16.345 --> 12:17.680
What do I care?

12:17.714 --> 12:19.515
He deserved what you did to him.

12:29.024 --> 12:30.092
I live here.

12:30.125 --> 12:31.994
- This is your place?
- Yeah.

12:33.495 --> 12:34.697
You must love what you do.

12:35.397 --> 12:36.699
Fulfill fantasies?

12:37.801 --> 12:39.001
Who wouldn't?

12:41.771 --> 12:43.038
Goodnight.

12:43.873 --> 12:45.240
Goodnight.

14:09.458 --> 14:10.459
Nick.

14:14.596 --> 14:16.131
Hey.

14:16.164 --> 14:18.100
Where did you get
this jacket?

14:18.567 --> 14:19.568
I don't remember.

14:20.135 --> 14:21.336
Give it to me.

14:21.871 --> 14:23.071
No.

14:32.180 --> 14:33.649
There's someone
I want you to meet.

14:41.323 --> 14:42.324
Mama.

14:44.626 --> 14:46.428
This is the man
I was telling you about.

14:46.963 --> 14:48.463
Nick Molloy.

14:49.264 --> 14:50.265
Hi.

15:12.755 --> 15:15.357
She says Irish.

15:16.224 --> 15:18.061
The good half.

15:18.093 --> 15:20.329
That's what my old man
used to tell me.

15:22.264 --> 15:23.532
Give us a minute.

15:41.216 --> 15:42.417
Who's this?

15:44.586 --> 15:45.654
Me.

15:52.729 --> 15:53.863
Wait.

15:54.596 --> 15:55.597
What?

15:58.300 --> 15:59.635
Where we going?

16:03.305 --> 16:06.042
Can't you adjust to
your surroundings or whatever?

16:06.075 --> 16:07.643
Like a ninja?

16:07.677 --> 16:08.678
No.

16:11.179 --> 16:13.181
I'm going to work.

16:24.093 --> 16:25.862
Is this your car?

16:27.596 --> 16:29.598
Shut up.

16:54.523 --> 16:56.693
This car is, like, brand new.

16:56.726 --> 16:59.962
- Yeah I built it up from junk.
- You built this?

16:59.996 --> 17:02.264
I didn't build it,
but I fixed it.

17:02.297 --> 17:04.167
Took me about five years.

17:04.199 --> 17:06.568
Ten, to be exact.

17:06.601 --> 17:09.939
I got kicked out of high school
so I went to trade school instead.

17:14.143 --> 17:15.912
I was also kicked out
of high school.

17:18.114 --> 17:19.514
Jinx.

17:21.249 --> 17:22.752
That's not how it works.

17:43.139 --> 17:44.372
- Hey.
- Hi.

17:44.406 --> 17:46.809
I'm here for a session
with Logan.

17:48.878 --> 17:50.713
- What's your name?
- Nomi.

17:56.384 --> 17:57.954
I'm getting no answer.

17:57.987 --> 18:00.223
I just ordered them a bunch of food,
though, so I know they're there.

18:00.255 --> 18:02.491
- Just head on back.
- Okay.

18:02.524 --> 18:04.026
Wait for me here, yeah?

18:04.060 --> 18:05.660
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'll be right back.

18:06.963 --> 18:09.564
Uh-huh.
Turn me up a little in there.

18:10.532 --> 18:12.434
<i>♪ Gorilla, uh</i>

18:12.467 --> 18:14.904

18:31.888 --> 18:33.956
- Oh hey, Nomi, what's up, boo?
- How are you?

18:33.990 --> 18:35.524
What's going on?

18:35.557 --> 18:37.193
You ready for these hooks?

18:37.226 --> 18:38.593
Your manager didn't call you?

18:38.627 --> 18:39.661
About what?

18:39.695 --> 18:40.897
Fuck.

18:40.930 --> 18:42.231
- You know this...
- No track?

18:42.265 --> 18:44.499
Nah, this dude,
I don't really know about him.

18:44.533 --> 18:47.003
- He made a couple of comments.
- My manager?

18:47.036 --> 18:48.704
What the fuck is this?

18:51.040 --> 18:53.075
Got any sports magazines here?

18:55.178 --> 18:57.013
That's all we got.

18:57.046 --> 18:58.413
Yo, what is this?

18:58.446 --> 18:59.816
Come on,
let me talk to you real quick.

18:59.849 --> 19:01.217
- Ain't nothing to talk about, man.
- Come on, come on.

19:01.250 --> 19:02.852
Matter of fact,
I'm glad this freak is here

19:02.885 --> 19:04.821
so I can tell them
to their fucking face.

19:04.854 --> 19:05.822
Tell me what?

19:05.855 --> 19:07.690
You wanna be on my hit list?
Why you so mad?

19:07.723 --> 19:09.558
Yo you better watch
your mother fucking mouth.

19:09.591 --> 19:10.659
Or what? What are you gonna do?

19:10.693 --> 19:12.228
Or I'm gonna smack
the shit out of you.

19:21.771 --> 19:22.939
What happened?

19:25.407 --> 19:27.143
- What happened?
- Where were you?

19:27.176 --> 19:28.211
You told me to sit...

19:28.244 --> 19:30.478
So you just do
whatever the fuck I say?

19:30.512 --> 19:32.614
- Yeah, I guess I do...
- Just shut up.

19:40.522 --> 19:42.390
Here, for parking.

19:43.292 --> 19:44.492
Take it!

19:48.297 --> 19:49.699
Go home.

20:12.288 --> 20:14.690
Hey, look what you
catch right here.

20:43.119 --> 20:46.088
All right, what are we looking at?
Let's get back to work.

20:46.122 --> 20:47.656
Or go home.

21:03.538 --> 21:05.507
I had to see this to believe it.

21:08.811 --> 21:10.645
Everything how you remember it?

21:11.881 --> 21:14.449
I've been meaning
to come by for a while now.

21:17.619 --> 21:19.689
So how have you been?

21:20.823 --> 21:22.792
- I've been good.
- Bullshit.

21:27.797 --> 21:29.497
It's good to see you, Nick.

21:42.912 --> 21:44.013
Hello?

21:44.046 --> 21:46.449
<i>You busy?</i>

21:46.481 --> 21:49.218
If you're asking if I want to get
ditched again, the answer is no.

21:50.186 --> 21:51.619
<i>I'm sorry, okay.</i>

21:53.255 --> 21:54.589
Well?

21:55.358 --> 21:56.624
Are you free?

22:00.528 --> 22:01.964
Let me see you.

22:02.497 --> 22:04.499
- No.
- Come on.

22:05.167 --> 22:06.501
They're too tight.

22:06.534 --> 22:08.204
It's a European fit.

22:09.105 --> 22:10.973
- Let me in.
- No.

22:13.476 --> 22:16.479
Now you have to come out.

22:16.511 --> 22:18.014
What am I doing here?

22:18.047 --> 22:19.181
You need a base.

22:19.215 --> 22:22.251
You'll burn to a crisp in LA
if you don't get some sun.

22:22.284 --> 22:24.787
Besides, it's the beach,
who doesn't love the beach?

22:34.296 --> 22:35.297
Well?

22:37.433 --> 22:40.602
Hey, it's not like I'm asking you
to turn around and touch your toes.

22:46.776 --> 22:49.845
Come on, we're losing prime sun.

22:52.715 --> 22:55.117
You know the sun's
not that good for you, right?

23:01.057 --> 23:03.192
I proposed here once.

23:03.225 --> 23:04.794
What'd she say?

23:05.928 --> 23:07.129
Yes.

23:07.163 --> 23:08.197
What?

23:09.065 --> 23:11.033
Tell me everything.

23:11.633 --> 23:13.102
What do you wanna know?

23:13.769 --> 23:16.671
She was nice, she was pretty.

23:17.406 --> 23:18.941
We used to work together.

23:19.674 --> 23:21.077
So what happened?

23:21.911 --> 23:24.080
It fell apart
after I lost a fight.

23:24.914 --> 23:26.949
I heard you were pretty good.

23:30.319 --> 23:31.954
I don't remember losing.

23:32.788 --> 23:35.291
I hear it sometimes.

23:35.324 --> 23:38.894
The thing is, I don't know
if it's a memory or a dream.

23:40.863 --> 23:43.132
So she was a fair-weather fan.

23:43.165 --> 23:44.700
Nah, she was cool.

23:46.102 --> 23:47.269
I hurt her.

23:48.437 --> 23:49.872
Her feelings.

23:53.008 --> 23:54.210
The end.

23:56.278 --> 23:57.645
Or the beginning.

24:59.074 --> 25:00.809
How're you doing
over there?

25:01.343 --> 25:02.344
Good.

25:03.479 --> 25:04.980
You like those?

25:06.215 --> 25:07.349
Yeah.

25:08.517 --> 25:09.885
Try them on.

25:12.855 --> 25:14.390
Do you have them
in a 10 and a half?

25:20.029 --> 25:21.263
Can I have a minute?

25:21.297 --> 25:22.765
Please take your time.

25:26.468 --> 25:29.271
I may have screwed up.

25:29.305 --> 25:32.274
They only have one room
for both of us.

25:40.449 --> 25:41.917
Take me to dinner tonight.

25:43.185 --> 25:44.186
What?

25:44.920 --> 25:46.922
We're going to dinner tonight.

25:47.556 --> 25:49.792
Before my show, on me.

25:50.359 --> 25:52.194
Okay.

25:52.228 --> 25:54.797
But I got to see
some people first.

25:54.830 --> 25:56.365
And I'm gonna go alone,
all right?

25:57.800 --> 25:59.201
You sure you don't need me?

25:59.735 --> 26:01.470
Definitely not.

26:03.505 --> 26:06.208
Meet me at Jean-Jacques
at 10:00.

26:06.242 --> 26:09.178
- P.M.?
- Yes.

26:09.211 --> 26:11.814
- For dinner?
- I got you something to wear to the pool,

26:11.847 --> 26:14.850
they're in that bag
in my luggage.

26:14.883 --> 26:16.485
And I'll see you later, okay?

27:38.067 --> 27:44.540
<i>♪ Hold on to your heart,

27:45.775 --> 27:50.979
<i>♪ When we're far apart,

27:52.915 --> 27:54.718
This place looks expensive.

27:54.751 --> 27:56.552
Only the best.

27:56.585 --> 27:58.921
Can I get you
sparkling or still water?

27:58.954 --> 28:00.356
Sparkling, please.

28:03.459 --> 28:05.561
Those shoes had zero grip.

28:10.165 --> 28:12.000
Where are the ones I bought?

28:12.901 --> 28:14.937
I need to be able to
plant my feet.

28:15.671 --> 28:17.873
It was like standing on ice.

28:17.906 --> 28:20.509
Can I get you two
something to drink other than water?

28:20.542 --> 28:22.010
I'll have champagne.

28:22.846 --> 28:24.613
Nothing for him.

28:24.646 --> 28:25.948
He's working.

28:25.981 --> 28:27.249
Very well, miss.

28:34.590 --> 28:36.191
I brought the shoes.

28:38.260 --> 28:40.429
I checked them up front,
want me to go get them?

28:45.067 --> 28:47.002
Unbutton that top button.

29:00.349 --> 29:01.450
Better?

29:01.818 --> 29:03.218

31:21.991 --> 31:23.625
Please, in the eyes.

31:26.361 --> 31:28.163
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

31:33.135 --> 31:35.203
Nomi, my dear,

31:35.237 --> 31:38.307
where have you been
all this time?

31:38.908 --> 31:40.309
We miss you.

31:40.342 --> 31:42.344
Come, and are you
enjoying your life?

31:43.412 --> 31:46.214
The new life I made for you?

31:46.248 --> 31:49.318
Is this the Nomi that
burned down the Malibu house?

31:50.419 --> 31:51.520
That...

31:52.554 --> 31:54.222
was an accident.

31:54.256 --> 31:59.595
Yes, a very,
very expensive accident.

32:04.132 --> 32:05.300
What did you promise?

32:05.334 --> 32:07.502
We've all heard this story.

32:09.104 --> 32:10.505
I have another one.

32:10.807 --> 32:12.140
Spill it.

32:12.976 --> 32:14.711
You owe me big time.

32:14.744 --> 32:15.979
Time to go.

32:16.012 --> 32:17.947
Nomi. Who is he?

32:17.981 --> 32:19.716
Nobody.

32:19.749 --> 32:23.418
So you add a bodyguard
to your trunk of rented clothes.

32:23.452 --> 32:26.188
Very clever, very clever.
I'll drink to that.

32:26.221 --> 32:28.657
- Hope you enjoyed the show.
- Nomi.

32:30.425 --> 32:31.259
Nomi.

32:31.293 --> 32:33.395
Nick, what are you doing?

32:33.428 --> 32:35.732
We can't leave. That man is
the reason why I'm here.

32:35.765 --> 32:36.933
You had too much to drink.

32:36.966 --> 32:39.267
Get off me. Get off me!

32:40.970 --> 32:42.872
What do you expect me to be?

32:42.905 --> 32:43.973
I'm not like other girls, okay?

32:44.007 --> 32:46.141
I don't just get things
handed to me.

32:46.174 --> 32:50.545
You really think after all this time,
that what I needed was a babysitter?

32:50.579 --> 32:52.614
You're even more clueless
than I thought.

32:54.117 --> 32:55.685
What do you want from me?

32:57.219 --> 32:59.488
I can't be something
that I'm not, okay?

33:02.557 --> 33:04.493
So that doesn't work for you.

33:11.100 --> 33:12.434
Let's go.

34:13.595 --> 34:14.797
Hey.

34:16.398 --> 34:18.467
I need you to come unzip me.

35:07.784 --> 35:10.652
- What's up?
- Hey, there he is.

35:15.158 --> 35:16.491
Thanks.

35:17.827 --> 35:19.762
Who do you like?

35:19.796 --> 35:22.364
If I had to pick, red.

35:22.397 --> 35:25.634
She's clever.
Setting something up.

35:25.667 --> 35:26.769
How's the gig?

35:28.271 --> 35:29.638
I don't know.

35:29.671 --> 35:30.807
Yes, you do.

35:32.374 --> 35:34.309
It's good.

35:34.342 --> 35:35.711
You're getting paid, right?

35:36.212 --> 35:37.579
I guess I am.

35:37.612 --> 35:39.447
Come on. You're a Bronx
boy your whole life,

35:39.481 --> 35:41.449
now you're getting paid
to see the world.

35:41.483 --> 35:43.753
I'd say
that's pretty goddamn good.

35:44.653 --> 35:45.922
Right?

35:48.257 --> 35:49.624
Fuck everyone else.

36:09.879 --> 36:11.479
Oh, hell no.

36:12.480 --> 36:14.583
I can't with these promoters.

37:03.933 --> 37:05.868
Oh, my God!

37:07.136 --> 37:09.671
Nomi, introduce me.

37:09.705 --> 37:12.909
This is my shadow,
Nicky "Mitts" Malloy.

37:16.112 --> 37:17.646
Whoa!

37:18.748 --> 37:20.515
Ahh!

37:20.548 --> 37:23.451
All right, let's hit it.

37:26.689 --> 37:30.159
I said, how are y'all
feeling out there?

37:31.426 --> 37:32.762
All right.

37:34.697 --> 37:37.632
<i>♪ I ain't never
gonna let you go</i>

37:37.666 --> 37:39.135
<i>♪ You're the dream

37:40.535 --> 37:42.504
<i>♪ Baby,

38:23.478 --> 38:26.215
Ooh, let's go, let's go.

38:28.317 --> 38:30.152
Come on, guys.

38:51.040 --> 38:53.242
Hello.

42:44.306 --> 42:45.709
How about that?

42:45.741 --> 42:47.309
- For what?
- For Nomi.

42:47.343 --> 42:49.278
- Absolutely.
- Ah.

42:49.311 --> 42:52.281
<i>What was your walkout song?
That's what it's called, right?</i>

42:52.314 --> 42:54.016
The song they play
when you walk out to the ring.

42:54.049 --> 42:55.351
It was
different every time.

42:56.352 --> 42:57.653
Usually slow songs.

42:57.687 --> 42:59.488
Slow songs? Why?

42:59.521 --> 43:00.923
You just wanna hype the crowd?

43:02.925 --> 43:04.326
Calm before the storm.

43:32.187 --> 43:35.291
I can't believe I haven't
seen you my whole life.

43:35.324 --> 43:36.358
I know.

43:36.392 --> 43:39.795
(CHUCKLES) I love all these
Latinos in Greece.

43:41.597 --> 43:43.198
So what time
is your show?

43:43.232 --> 43:45.769
- Uh, probably like 10:00 or 11:00.
- Oh, cool.

43:45.801 --> 43:47.069
It's like
a stadium show, so...

43:47.102 --> 43:49.438
- Oh! Yes, yes.
- Come and check it out.

44:22.471 --> 44:25.874
- Tomorrow, please, tomorrow.
- Thank you.

46:51.520 --> 46:53.155
- Hi.
- Can you pay me what you owe me

46:53.188 --> 46:55.457
for this week? Minus yesterday.

46:59.528 --> 47:00.596
Yeah.

47:09.739 --> 47:11.473
Thanks.

47:11.507 --> 47:13.108
- Where are you going?
- I quit.

47:15.344 --> 47:16.846
Nick.

47:16.880 --> 47:17.947
Nick, you can't go.

47:17.981 --> 47:19.181
You don't need me.

47:19.214 --> 47:20.950
Hell, you don't need anyone.

47:20.984 --> 47:22.251
Airport.

47:22.785 --> 47:24.052
Just say it.

47:25.053 --> 47:26.321
Say what?

47:27.456 --> 47:29.157
Okay, I want you to stay, okay?

47:33.730 --> 47:35.163
Maybe I don't need you.

47:35.197 --> 47:36.632
Is this really
the life you want?

47:38.200 --> 47:40.770
Moving from place to place
and person to person?

47:41.971 --> 47:44.306
With nobody? Nothing?

47:44.741 --> 47:45.742
No home?

47:48.845 --> 47:50.379
I'll never have the life
that I want.

47:55.718 --> 47:56.786
No one will.

48:13.268 --> 48:15.337
Hi, can you get me to Thailand?

49:20.435 --> 49:24.272
More power! Okay?
Farang!

49:24.306 --> 49:26.743
More power! Go!

49:56.973 --> 49:58.373
Hey, Farang!

50:22.564 --> 50:23.665
Huh?

50:33.743 --> 50:35.544
- Any advice?
- Yes.

50:35.577 --> 50:36.578
Go home.

51:49.786 --> 51:51.553
All the best for tonight.

51:51.586 --> 51:52.722
- Have fun please.
- Thank you.

51:52.755 --> 51:54.422
We really hope
you have fun.

Hey there, guys,

56:43.779 --> 56:45.514
I'm here with the former champ
Brett "The Threat" Hlavacek.

56:45.548 --> 56:47.083
He has been living and training
in Bangkok

56:47.116 --> 56:48.284
for the past two months.

56:48.317 --> 56:50.319
- How are you doing, Brett?
- Doing great, thanks for asking.

56:50.352 --> 56:51.687
I'm here with
some old teammates,

56:51.720 --> 56:53.089
we're watching
a night of fights,

56:53.122 --> 56:54.156
life's all right.

56:54.190 --> 56:55.357
Now your last fight,

56:55.391 --> 56:56.425
you put in a great performance

56:56.459 --> 56:57.927
against an up-and-coming
young fighter.

56:57.960 --> 56:59.428
When can we see you
in the ring again?

56:59.462 --> 57:00.896
As soon as possible.

57:00.930 --> 57:05.134
<i>This is Tiger
Radio One in Bangkok on 104.1</i>

57:06.702 --> 57:07.970
Rice.

57:10.239 --> 57:11.606
Rice and ketchup.

57:11.639 --> 57:12.875
Is that a thing?

57:12.908 --> 57:14.710
No, I wasn't eating
rice and ketchup.

57:14.743 --> 57:17.079
It's a cheap immigrant
family type.

57:17.113 --> 57:19.248
- Yeah, wow!
- Spanish people do it.

57:19.281 --> 57:20.583
No, no honestly, yeah.

57:20.615 --> 57:21.884
Even Asians.

57:33.129 --> 57:34.930
- There's more beer.
- Yeah.

57:38.868 --> 57:42.071
- Dip it in sauce.
- I'm a no-sauce guy.

57:42.104 --> 57:44.373
All right, guys,
let's do some drinking.

57:44.406 --> 57:45.673

57:48.210 --> 57:49.211
Thanks.

57:50.579 --> 57:52.281
All right, let's go.

57:52.314 --> 57:54.016
Cheers.

57:59.788 --> 58:00.990
Delicious.

58:03.592 --> 58:04.894
Let's do it again.

58:04.927 --> 58:06.529
You know we got a train
in the morning, right?

58:08.663 --> 58:10.366
Yeah, I do, actually. Yeah.

58:14.537 --> 58:15.804
Bring it back.

58:30.386 --> 58:31.420
Not again.

58:31.453 --> 58:33.389
- Yeah.
- No, not again.

58:34.190 --> 58:36.458
<i>This is
Tiger Radio One</i>

58:36.492 --> 58:38.994
<i>in Bangkok on 104.1.</i>

58:42.164 --> 58:44.400
Nick, where are you
going buddy? Nick.

58:45.401 --> 58:47.303
All right, you guys.

58:48.204 --> 58:49.271
I hate you.

58:56.680 --> 58:57.846
<i>Hi, you've reached Nomi.</i>

58:57.880 --> 58:59.215
<i>Leave a message
and I'll get back to you.</i>

59:00.583 --> 59:01.850
Hey, it's Nick.

59:03.652 --> 59:05.054
I've been getting some good sun.

59:06.455 --> 59:07.823
Called to tell you about it.

59:09.658 --> 59:10.993
Hope you got home okay.

59:26.842 --> 59:28.410
<i>I've been getting
some good sun.</i>

59:29.578 --> 59:30.913
<i>Called to tell you that.</i>

59:39.154 --> 59:40.422
Got these for the boys.

59:43.459 --> 59:44.493
That's great.

59:45.494 --> 59:46.762
Welcome home.

59:48.931 --> 59:50.199
You got an offer.

59:50.633 --> 59:51.800
For what?

59:51.834 --> 59:54.738
A fight, tough nuts.
What do you think?

59:54.770 --> 59:56.538
Who knows I've been training?

59:56.572 --> 59:57.906
I didn't say a word.

59:59.441 --> 1:00:01.210
Well?

1:00:01.243 --> 1:00:03.178
Come on, you fuck.

1:00:04.013 --> 1:00:05.781
So put that jab out there.

1:00:07.650 --> 1:00:09.418
What're you, punching him
in the tits?

1:00:09.451 --> 1:00:10.452
Come on.

1:00:14.691 --> 1:00:15.725
Hands up.

1:00:15.759 --> 1:00:17.026
There it is.

1:00:18.728 --> 1:00:20.129
Right on that front leg.

1:00:22.831 --> 1:00:24.333
All right, stop.

1:00:24.366 --> 1:00:26.335
What're you,
telegraphing that switch?

1:00:26.368 --> 1:00:28.237
I can see it a mile away.
Can't be doing that, right?

1:00:28.270 --> 1:00:30.172
I don't wanna see you
picking that foot up, right?

1:00:30.205 --> 1:00:31.373
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:00:31.407 --> 1:00:33.242
- Yeah? You know this, right?
- All right.

1:00:33.275 --> 1:00:34.410
Good.

1:00:34.443 --> 1:00:36.746
Don't let him get away
with that, Walter.

1:00:36.780 --> 1:00:38.847
Oh, sorry honey.
Gym is closed.

1:00:38.881 --> 1:00:40.349
Does it look like
I'm here to fight?

1:00:40.382 --> 1:00:41.450
It's cool.

1:00:42.184 --> 1:00:43.285
What's up?

1:00:53.996 --> 1:00:55.331
- Are you Nomi?
- Yeah.

1:01:06.075 --> 1:01:07.443
So you're that boy.

1:01:08.944 --> 1:01:11.113
The one that's been
hanging around my daughter.

1:01:12.181 --> 1:01:13.248
Yeah.

1:01:17.553 --> 1:01:19.054
You know, when my mother...

1:01:20.856 --> 1:01:22.958
When I was pregnant,

1:01:22.991 --> 1:01:25.094
my mother knew
I was gonna have a girl.

1:01:26.061 --> 1:01:27.896
She told me that baby

1:01:27.930 --> 1:01:30.199
is gonna show you
the real meaning of life.

1:01:31.500 --> 1:01:35.371
So when Nomi was born,
I knew she was that baby.

1:01:36.672 --> 1:01:38.240
You see, I know my kid.

1:01:41.176 --> 1:01:43.645
I tried to teach her
how to survive here,

1:01:45.080 --> 1:01:47.549
how to keep herself from
being hurt from men

1:01:47.583 --> 1:01:49.151
that would do anything...

1:01:50.018 --> 1:01:51.954
to get what they want from her.

1:01:54.858 --> 1:01:56.225
I did the best I could.

1:01:57.526 --> 1:01:58.660
Nomi's a tough cookie.

1:02:00.295 --> 1:02:01.363
Maybe too tough.

1:02:02.766 --> 1:02:03.999
There's no such thing.

1:02:06.703 --> 1:02:08.137
I'm sorry for your loss.

1:02:09.538 --> 1:02:10.606
Hey, Irish...

1:02:12.141 --> 1:02:14.676
wanna know what the key to
a woman's heart is?

1:02:16.846 --> 1:02:18.046
Be there.

1:02:21.550 --> 1:02:24.687
I'm actually a whole bunch of
different European races.

1:02:24.721 --> 1:02:26.088
Whatever, baby.

1:03:30.419 --> 1:03:32.521
I'm not allowed to
answer the door.

1:03:39.796 --> 1:03:42.431
Hi, is uh... Nick home?

1:03:43.232 --> 1:03:44.333
No.

1:03:44.366 --> 1:03:46.301
I just came to wish him luck.

1:03:47.704 --> 1:03:49.137
Do you know who I am?

1:03:49.171 --> 1:03:50.506
Yeah, that's a bad idea.

1:03:52.241 --> 1:03:55.210
What? Wishing him luck
or... me in general?

1:03:55.879 --> 1:03:57.079
Both.

1:04:00.582 --> 1:04:01.784
It's superstition.

1:04:03.552 --> 1:04:06.388
I'll tell him you stopped by,
but after the fight. How's that?

1:04:07.991 --> 1:04:09.558
Boys are ridiculous.

1:04:15.564 --> 1:04:16.632
Who was that?

1:04:18.634 --> 1:04:20.168
How's your weight?

1:04:20.202 --> 1:04:21.503
I'm two pounds over.

1:04:22.604 --> 1:04:23.672
Who was it?

1:04:28.410 --> 1:04:29.478
Nomi.

1:04:31.079 --> 1:04:32.347
Hey!

1:04:34.316 --> 1:04:35.718
What are you doing here?

1:04:35.752 --> 1:04:39.054
I... just came to make sure
you're staying out of trouble.

1:04:39.889 --> 1:04:41.256
You look good.

1:04:41.724 --> 1:04:43.592
Thanks, so do you.

1:04:44.794 --> 1:04:46.395
Flattery will not work.

1:04:46.428 --> 1:04:48.196
You cannot have your job back.

1:04:49.966 --> 1:04:51.366
I shouldn't have left
like I did.

1:04:53.435 --> 1:04:56.371
Yeah, we... We both did things
we shouldn't have done.

1:04:58.975 --> 1:05:00.475
I heard you came to the wake.

1:05:01.376 --> 1:05:02.644
Yeah.

1:05:02.678 --> 1:05:03.746
I'm sorry.

1:05:05.848 --> 1:05:07.717
She wasn't in any pain, so...

1:05:09.819 --> 1:05:11.788
Anyway, I brought you something.

1:05:16.091 --> 1:05:18.160
There is a track
on this flash drive

1:05:18.193 --> 1:05:21.463
that I think is
the perfect walkout song.

1:05:22.097 --> 1:05:23.365
Thanks.

1:05:24.666 --> 1:05:25.735
Do you wanna come?

1:05:27.302 --> 1:05:28.403
I leave tomorrow
to South America,

1:05:28.437 --> 1:05:30.707
I have like,
a full month of shows.

1:05:30.740 --> 1:05:32.341
Flying on the red eye.

1:05:33.977 --> 1:05:35.210
I'm bad luck anyway, right?

1:05:35.243 --> 1:05:37.245
That's what your boy
just told me.

1:05:37.279 --> 1:05:39.181
Yeah, you probably wouldn't
have liked it anyway.

1:05:42.551 --> 1:05:43.720
I should pack.

1:05:43.753 --> 1:05:45.855
I haven't even done it and...

1:05:45.888 --> 1:05:47.890
I... Yeah, I should go.

1:05:48.624 --> 1:05:49.692
I'll see you.

1:05:52.862 --> 1:05:54.363
You can call me if you want.

1:05:57.199 --> 1:05:58.467
Why would I do that?

1:05:59.769 --> 1:06:00.837
You get lonely?

1:06:04.640 --> 1:06:05.708
Do you?

1:06:07.043 --> 1:06:08.310
All the time.

1:06:12.115 --> 1:06:14.349
Okay go. I hate goodbyes.

1:06:17.854 --> 1:06:18.921
Nicky.

1:06:21.323 --> 1:06:22.859
You don't have to win.

1:06:25.795 --> 1:06:26.863
I know.

1:07:27.890 --> 1:07:29.558
Where the hell is this boy?

1:07:37.133 --> 1:07:39.634
Gee, Nicky.
Glad you could make it.

1:07:40.635 --> 1:07:42.739
It's called fashionably late.

1:07:42.772 --> 1:07:44.874
How about we get you
fashionably taped?

1:08:06.829 --> 1:08:07.897
You're good?

1:08:10.066 --> 1:08:11.701
- Great.
- All right, warm up.

1:08:31.486 --> 1:08:32.688
Thanks, Mack.

1:08:33.756 --> 1:08:34.824
For what?

1:08:36.092 --> 1:08:37.459
Never giving up on me.

1:08:38.560 --> 1:08:40.595
Yeah, well it ain't over
till it is.

1:08:41.429 --> 1:08:43.532
What do you say?
Gonna do this thing?

1:08:55.111 --> 1:08:56.645
We live for this shit, Nicky.

1:10:14.623 --> 1:10:17.193
It's time for
five rounds of

1:10:17.226 --> 1:10:20.629
full rules Muay Thai.

1:10:22.631 --> 1:10:24.166
Introducing first...

1:10:25.234 --> 1:10:27.303
fighting out of the red corner,

1:10:27.336 --> 1:10:30.773
weighing in at 174 pounds,

1:10:30.806 --> 1:10:35.644
fighting out of Rose Muay Thai
by way of Bronx, New York,

1:10:36.178 --> 1:10:42.251
Nicky "Mitts" Malloy!

1:10:42.285 --> 1:10:46.554
And in the blue corner,

1:10:46.588 --> 1:10:50.960
weighing in at 171.5 pounds,

1:10:50.993 --> 1:10:56.299
fighting out of Khongsittha
by way of Brooklyn, New York,

1:10:56.332 --> 1:11:02.071
Brett, "The Threat" Hlavacek.

1:11:02.104 --> 1:11:03.906
Remember what we worked on.
He's got a fat right hand,

1:11:03.940 --> 1:11:05.674
he's got speed, he's got
that awkward timing crap.

1:11:05.708 --> 1:11:07.243
But you've got me, all right?
Let's do this.

1:11:07.276 --> 1:11:09.111
- You got this.
- Do your thing, Nicky,

1:11:09.145 --> 1:11:10.179
bust him up.

1:11:14.350 --> 1:11:15.851
Loser buys lunch tomorrow?

1:11:16.285 --> 1:11:17.687
Lunch and drinks.

1:11:18.520 --> 1:11:19.889
I'd shake, but...

1:11:27.830 --> 1:11:29.497
Which terminal, ma'am?

1:11:35.537 --> 1:11:37.572
- What's your name, sweetheart?
- John.

1:11:38.708 --> 1:11:40.843
- We have a stop first, John.
- No problem.

1:11:53.488 --> 1:11:54.857
I can't watch this.

1:12:00.796 --> 1:12:01.831
Fight!

1:12:20.149 --> 1:12:21.183
What the fuck, ref?

1:12:21.217 --> 1:12:22.752
Hands up, hands up.

1:12:39.235 --> 1:12:41.203
This isn't anything
you haven't seen before.

1:12:41.937 --> 1:12:43.372
Right?

1:12:43.406 --> 1:12:45.573
Okay, Nicky,
you can't stomp a snake

1:12:45.607 --> 1:12:47.209
with both feet
in the bucket, okay?

1:12:48.044 --> 1:12:49.111
Okay?

1:12:49.577 --> 1:12:51.313
Relax. Breathe.

1:12:53.149 --> 1:12:54.216
Seconds out.

1:12:55.583 --> 1:12:56.886
Let's go.

1:12:59.088 --> 1:13:00.089
Nick!

1:13:05.895 --> 1:13:07.229
Fight!

1:13:18.541 --> 1:13:19.742
Come on!

1:13:20.976 --> 1:13:23.879
- How you doing bro? Good?
- You're okay?

1:14:10.259 --> 1:14:11.260
Nicky.

1:14:15.965 --> 1:14:16.966
Nicky.

1:14:21.370 --> 1:14:25.040
Nick. Or the beginning.

1:15:20.196 --> 1:15:21.263
Don't go.

1:15:22.798 --> 1:15:24.466
I have a plane to catch.

1:15:26.402 --> 1:15:27.803
One more night...

1:15:29.004 --> 1:15:30.072
with me.

1:15:31.540 --> 1:15:32.808
Okay.

1:15:34.376 --> 1:15:35.844
But only because I hate...
