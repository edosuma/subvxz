Hey, Marco.
Can I get your help
with something?

00:54.688 --> 00:56.722
Can't help right now.
I just found out

00:56.724 --> 00:59.091
there's a Mackie Hand
movie marathon tonight,

00:59.093 --> 01:01.427
- and I can't miss it.
- Ooh. Who's Mackie Hand?

01:01.429 --> 01:03.695
He's the greatest martial-arts
superstar who ever lived.

01:03.697 --> 01:05.397
He died 30 years ago
while performing

01:05.399 --> 01:07.099
one of his own stunts
on...

01:07.101 --> 01:09.201
himself. Accidentally.

01:09.203 --> 01:11.837
Come on, come on,
come on!

01:11.839 --> 01:14.740
( inhales deeply )

01:14.742 --> 01:17.743
Ooh!!

01:17.745 --> 01:19.411
What is it?
What's wrong?

01:19.413 --> 01:21.246
It's sold out.

01:21.248 --> 01:24.583
Oh. I'm sorry,
little guy.

01:24.585 --> 01:26.618
( muffled )
It's okay.

01:26.620 --> 01:30.389
It was just a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

01:30.391 --> 01:33.425
Don't worry. I'm sure
there's a chance you can
still get a ticket.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.661
Good things
don't happen to me.

01:39.199 --> 01:40.899
Hey. What's up?

01:40.901 --> 01:42.968
- BOTH: Tom?
- What are you doing here?

01:42.970 --> 01:45.904
Actually, I was wondering
if we could hang out.

01:45.906 --> 01:49.741
Ugh. No, no, no.
A million times no.

01:49.743 --> 01:52.311
Not with you, Star.
I meant with Marco.

01:52.313 --> 01:54.713
Huh? Uh... no.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.748
Oh. Okay then.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.717
Guess I'll just find
somebody else

01:58.719 --> 02:02.788
to go with to
the Mackie Hand movie marathon.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.623
Huh? What?

02:04.625 --> 02:05.824
Wait, you're a fan
of Mackie Hand?

02:05.826 --> 02:07.426
I'm a super fan.

02:07.428 --> 02:09.628
Why do you want
to go with me?

02:09.630 --> 02:13.265
I really thought
we connected that one time.

02:13.267 --> 02:14.733
Over ping-pong?

02:14.735 --> 02:16.668
You kidnapped me.

02:16.670 --> 02:19.805
Look, I know I've been
a little aggro in the past,

02:19.807 --> 02:22.474
and I'm sorry.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.009
I promise not to
get mad this time.

02:24.011 --> 02:25.511
( grunting )

02:25.513 --> 02:28.280
Star, what is he up to?

02:28.282 --> 02:30.282
I think you should
go with him.

02:30.284 --> 02:32.985
He's obviously trying
to bury the hammer
or whatever.

02:32.987 --> 02:35.120
Hatchet.
Bury the hatchet.

02:35.122 --> 02:37.122
Well, the marathon
is all the way

02:37.124 --> 02:38.757
on the other side of town,

02:38.759 --> 02:41.527
so... are you coming
or not?

02:48.801 --> 02:50.202
Whoa!

02:50.204 --> 02:52.971
Let me just
give you a tour.

02:52.973 --> 02:54.673
Giddy up, skeleton horse.

02:54.675 --> 02:57.209
( whinnies )

02:57.211 --> 02:59.011
So here it is.

02:59.013 --> 03:00.879
We got six
flat-screen TV's,

03:00.881 --> 03:02.814
a photo booth,
karaoke machine.

03:02.816 --> 03:05.884
- Is that a white tiger?
- ( purring loudly )

03:05.886 --> 03:07.786
And up here
is the lounge.

03:07.788 --> 03:10.355
Here. Have a seat
in the throne.

03:10.357 --> 03:12.291
Are you comfortable?
Can I get you anything?

03:12.293 --> 03:13.859
Some cereal perhaps?

03:16.062 --> 03:18.830
Look, you're being
super nice to me right now,

03:18.832 --> 03:21.533
and you're never
nice to me.

03:21.535 --> 03:22.734
What's this really
all about?

03:22.736 --> 03:25.804
Wha... I'm just
a huge fan

03:25.806 --> 03:27.306
of Mackie Hand.

03:27.308 --> 03:29.575
What's your favorite
Mackie Hand movie then?

03:29.577 --> 03:31.143
Uh, it's...
( stammering )

03:31.145 --> 03:32.978
I knew it.

03:32.980 --> 03:35.814
You don't know the first
thing about kung-fu.
I'm outta here.

03:35.816 --> 03:37.816
No, wait, wait.

03:37.818 --> 03:40.719
It's just because
I have two favorites.

03:40.721 --> 03:41.753
<i>Hand To Hand To Hand,</i>

03:41.755 --> 03:44.089
and  <i>Hand To Hand To Hand 2.</i>

03:44.091 --> 03:47.359
Now that I'm saying it,
I'm gonna have to go
with the original.

03:47.361 --> 03:50.362
Oh. Yeah, you're right.
That is the best one.

03:50.364 --> 03:51.863
But not the English version.

03:51.865 --> 03:54.366
I'm talking about
the original in Swedish.

03:54.368 --> 03:57.369
Huh. I guess you do
like stuff.

03:57.371 --> 04:00.072
I'm... sorry.

04:00.074 --> 04:02.174
No, no, no,
I get it, I get it.

04:02.176 --> 04:05.244
It can be hard to
break through people's
preconceptions of me.

04:05.246 --> 04:07.045
That's why I don't
have many friends.

04:07.047 --> 04:09.047
I haven't even been to
a movie marathon before.

04:09.049 --> 04:10.582
( engine revving )

04:10.584 --> 04:12.951
Hey, where did you pick up
your sweet ride?

04:12.953 --> 04:14.886
At a funeral home?

04:14.888 --> 04:17.356
Are you gonna go pick up
someone's dead grandpa

04:17.358 --> 04:19.424
and hold a respectful
service for him?

04:19.426 --> 04:21.927
You think you guys
are fast?

04:21.929 --> 04:24.930
I can guarantee that we'll
beat you to the next light

04:24.932 --> 04:26.765
without even
breaking a sweat.

04:26.767 --> 04:29.568
Yeah. What are ya,
chicken?

04:29.570 --> 04:31.570
BOTH: What?!

04:31.572 --> 04:33.038
- Bro.
- Bro.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.807
- Bro!
- You're on, punk.

04:36.909 --> 04:39.611
( tires squealing )

04:39.613 --> 04:41.813
Oh, I'll show them.

04:41.815 --> 04:43.415
No, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

04:43.417 --> 04:47.219
( siren blaring,
police radio chatter )

04:47.221 --> 04:49.521
Those guys are
going to jail.

04:58.998 --> 05:00.766
( raucous laughter )

05:00.768 --> 05:02.801
Oh, that was...
that was so much more fun

05:02.803 --> 05:04.903
than obliterating people.

05:04.905 --> 05:06.938
Yeah! This whole thing
reminds me of

05:06.940 --> 05:08.507
one of my favorite songs,
"Awesome Feeling."

05:08.509 --> 05:10.475
Wait, wait, wait.

05:10.477 --> 05:12.744
Isn't that a song
by Love Sentence?

05:12.746 --> 05:13.812
( humming song )

05:13.814 --> 05:17.816
Uhhhh....

05:17.818 --> 05:19.117
Yeah.

05:19.119 --> 05:21.987
Come with me.

05:23.089 --> 05:25.190
No way!

05:25.192 --> 05:29.661
You have a signed picture
of you and Justin Towers?

05:29.663 --> 05:33.265
I also have a vintage
five-disc CD player

05:33.267 --> 05:35.801
with automatic shuffle.

05:35.803 --> 05:38.670

06:07.801 --> 06:09.968

06:09.970 --> 06:12.671
Man, I can't believe
I'm actually having
a good time with you.

06:12.673 --> 06:14.573
I know. Right?

06:14.575 --> 06:17.376
Heck, I could just skip
that whole movie marathon and--

06:17.378 --> 06:18.977
Oh, my gosh.
The marathon.

06:18.979 --> 06:21.046
- What time is it?
- Don't freak out.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.115
It starts in...
ten minutes?!

06:25.752 --> 06:27.386
What the heck?

06:27.388 --> 06:29.755
Hey, can you unlock the door?

06:29.757 --> 06:34.226
Actually, I can't
let you leave yet.

06:34.228 --> 06:37.028
What? But we gotta go.
We're gonna be late.

06:37.030 --> 06:39.898
Couldn't we just
chill here for, like,

06:39.900 --> 06:41.533
another four-and-a-half
minutes?

06:41.535 --> 06:44.069
No. Seriously,
let me go.

06:44.071 --> 06:45.737
Please.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.740
Just wait
a little longer.

06:48.742 --> 06:51.543
What is wrong with you?
I said let me go!

06:51.545 --> 06:53.879
And I said wait!

06:53.881 --> 06:55.781
( whistle blows )

06:57.250 --> 06:58.917
Sorry, Tom.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.353
That's an instant fail
for you.

07:01.355 --> 07:03.789
Hey, you almost made it
this time.

07:03.791 --> 07:05.457
No, no.
Wait, wait.

07:05.459 --> 07:07.292
You gotta give me
a second chance.

07:07.294 --> 07:10.595
Okay, seriously,
what is going on here?

07:10.597 --> 07:12.764
Dude, I cleaned
your litter box.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.300
Well, Master Tom here
was just about to earn

07:15.302 --> 07:17.869
his anger management
graduation badge.

07:17.871 --> 07:20.539
All he had to do
was spend three hours alone

07:20.541 --> 07:23.875
with the person
he hated the most
without blowing up.

07:23.877 --> 07:26.144
But you,
you had to be selfish.

07:26.146 --> 07:28.980
You could wait another
four minutes and 15 seconds.

07:28.982 --> 07:32.317
All you care about are your
precious karate movie tickets.

07:32.319 --> 07:34.653
- Well, guess what.
- ( gasps )

07:34.655 --> 07:37.622
Mackie Hand movies
are garbage.

07:42.061 --> 07:44.629
Are you kidding me?

07:44.631 --> 07:47.132
You lied to me about
being a Mackie fan,

07:47.134 --> 07:48.967
and pretended to be
my friend

07:48.969 --> 07:51.236
so you could earn
some badge?

07:51.238 --> 07:54.005
Dude, you're a jerk
and a liar,

07:54.007 --> 07:56.174
and that's not even
the worst part.

07:56.176 --> 07:58.376
I was dumb enough
to fall for it!

08:04.750 --> 08:06.451
Marco, wait.

08:06.453 --> 08:10.021
I do like Love Sentence.
That part wasn't a lie.

08:10.023 --> 08:12.257
Too little,
too late.

08:12.259 --> 08:14.860
Which is my second-favorite
Love Sentence song,

08:14.862 --> 08:16.161
by the way.

08:18.130 --> 08:23.602
♪ Oh, girl, you know

08:23.604 --> 08:28.473

09:16.355 --> 09:22.894

09:45.384 --> 09:47.586
It's... it's...

09:47.588 --> 09:50.822
Mackie Hand!

09:52.858 --> 09:54.526
I took quite a tumble there.

09:54.528 --> 09:57.262
How long was I out?
I hope I didn't make us fall

09:57.264 --> 09:58.964
too far behind
shooting schedule.

09:58.966 --> 10:03.301
Mr. Hand, I can't believe
it's really you.

10:03.303 --> 10:05.136
Say, you must be
the new PA.

10:05.138 --> 10:07.472
Kevin, right?
Nice to meet you.

10:07.474 --> 10:10.141
Oh, my gosh. I wish I had
something for you to sign.

10:10.143 --> 10:11.543
Eh, don't sweat it.

10:11.545 --> 10:13.378
I gotcha covered.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.213
Hold still.

10:15.215 --> 10:17.749
There you go.

10:17.751 --> 10:20.585
Tom, I can't believe you brought
Mackie Hand back from the dead

10:20.587 --> 10:22.120
just for me!

10:22.122 --> 10:24.556
That was... that was
cool of you.

10:24.558 --> 10:26.324
Wait, I'm dead?

10:32.131 --> 10:35.333
Three for the Mackie Hand
marathon, please.

10:35.335 --> 10:37.135
What does the sign say?

10:37.137 --> 10:40.271
Wait, but... do you know
who this is?

10:40.273 --> 10:42.674
This is  <i>the </i> Mackie Hand
in the flesh.

10:42.676 --> 10:46.478
Nice costume, but no one
gets in without a ticket.

10:46.480 --> 10:49.848
Now shove off, grandpa,
before I have to get physical.

10:55.321 --> 10:57.188
Hey! You!

11:01.861 --> 11:03.628
You were right.

11:03.630 --> 11:05.163
This guy's for real.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.198
Yeah. I told you.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.601
I still don't
like you, Tom.

11:09.603 --> 11:11.670
I still don't
like you, too, Marco.

11:28.821 --> 11:31.389
Is mystery.

11:33.325 --> 11:36.961
How is there hole
in Newman force field?

11:36.963 --> 11:41.332
Maybe better question is,
who make hole?

11:41.334 --> 11:44.736
They find weakness
in Newman magic.

11:44.738 --> 11:46.905
Could be huge advantage
for all monsters.

11:46.907 --> 11:50.642
Help my babies
have future.

11:52.645 --> 11:54.579
You do realize that when
you're writing,

11:54.581 --> 11:56.281
you're talking out loud.

11:57.349 --> 12:01.920
Uh... oh, thank you.
I didn't realize I was...

12:05.691 --> 12:08.293
( groaning )

12:11.597 --> 12:14.866
Hey, rat,
what is this place?

12:14.868 --> 12:17.235
( angry squealing )

12:17.237 --> 12:19.604
( struggling )

12:19.606 --> 12:21.873
There's only
one way outta here,

12:21.875 --> 12:24.008
and it's through me.

12:24.010 --> 12:26.377
Uh, okay, but I did not
ask to leave.

12:26.379 --> 12:29.013
Nice try, pal,

12:29.015 --> 12:32.917
but you're not gonna talk
your way outta here.

12:32.919 --> 12:35.587
'Cause the only way...

12:35.589 --> 12:38.123
out of here...

12:38.125 --> 12:40.959
is through me.

12:40.961 --> 12:42.761
Okay, but...

12:42.763 --> 12:44.395
( groaning )

12:44.397 --> 12:46.197
What is this?

12:46.199 --> 12:47.766
( screaming )

12:47.768 --> 12:49.434
( whistles )

12:49.436 --> 12:52.036
Hm? Oh.

12:54.106 --> 12:56.975
This could feed
a lot of monsters.

12:56.977 --> 12:59.878
So where does all this
delicious corn go?

12:59.880 --> 13:02.180
To the grinder.

13:12.825 --> 13:16.461
Hey, stop the thing.

13:18.063 --> 13:20.298
Why does he
have to yell?

13:20.300 --> 13:21.733
Hands.

13:23.836 --> 13:27.105
I will not.
Okay, I will.

13:27.107 --> 13:29.474
Get to work,
frog man.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.309
What are ya
waiting for?

13:31.311 --> 13:34.145
Get moving!

13:36.182 --> 13:39.984
So tell me,
where does all this corn go

13:39.986 --> 13:42.320
after we grind it?

13:42.322 --> 13:45.123
It goes in the hole.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.758
Why?

13:46.760 --> 13:48.993
'Cause if we don't,
we get thrown down that hole.

13:50.529 --> 13:53.498
No. I mean,
where does it go

13:53.500 --> 13:55.834
It goes in the hole.

13:55.836 --> 13:58.369
Okay, we established that.
But then what?

13:58.371 --> 14:00.505
Then we eat dinner.

14:00.507 --> 14:03.341
No, the corn!
I'm talking about the corn!

14:03.343 --> 14:06.044
Where does the corn go?

14:06.046 --> 14:08.279
Oh, the corn.

14:08.281 --> 14:11.282
It goes in the hole.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.184
( frustrated stammering )

14:13.186 --> 14:16.387
Yes, the corn goes
in the hole.

14:16.389 --> 14:18.857
So you do know
where it goes then.

14:18.859 --> 14:22.360
You know exactly
where it goes.

14:22.362 --> 14:25.363
It goes in your pockets.

14:25.365 --> 14:29.133
( nervous chuckle )
How did those kernels
get in there?

14:29.135 --> 14:33.738
The boss doesn't look
kindly on those who
steal from him.

14:33.740 --> 14:35.840
He wants to see you.

14:35.842 --> 14:38.977
The boss wants
to see me?

14:38.979 --> 14:41.546
- The... boss!
- ( screaming )

14:41.548 --> 14:42.580
No, no, no!

14:42.582 --> 14:44.916
Boss?

14:46.585 --> 14:49.420
Hey, whoa, whoa, no need
to get the boss involved here.

14:49.422 --> 14:51.022
It's just a few
kernels of corn.

14:51.024 --> 14:53.992
No worries.
I got this.

14:53.994 --> 14:56.761
Hey, I'll even make sure to
scream all the way down, okay?

14:56.763 --> 14:58.930
Enjoy the rest of your day.

14:58.932 --> 15:00.498
Bye!
( screaming )

15:02.234 --> 15:06.771
( scream fades,
then resumes )

15:09.608 --> 15:16.848
Must find out
who is boss.

15:16.850 --> 15:18.516
No fun!

15:25.357 --> 15:27.659
( snoring )

15:56.655 --> 15:58.990
( laughing )

16:34.626 --> 16:37.662
This guy has
own cornfield.

16:38.664 --> 16:42.567
This guy has
own cornfie...

16:53.345 --> 16:55.380
Cornmeal.

16:55.382 --> 16:56.714
( squeaking )

17:09.661 --> 17:13.898
Unicastle...
made of corn?

17:21.407 --> 17:24.175
Oh!

17:24.177 --> 17:26.544
( gasps )

17:26.546 --> 17:29.213
Know why they call me
Meat Fork?

17:29.215 --> 17:30.715
Why?

17:30.717 --> 17:35.420
Because it's
a family name.

17:35.422 --> 17:37.555
I'm not going back
to grinder.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.924
- No?
- No.

17:39.926 --> 17:42.226
- No?!
- No.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.762
<i>No?!!</i>

17:44.764 --> 17:46.230
No.

17:46.232 --> 17:49.934
Okay. Then can you please
take me with you?

17:49.936 --> 17:51.602
Corn on the cob
or creamed corn?

17:51.604 --> 17:53.571
Creamed corn.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.339
- Creamed corn
or popcorn?
- Popcorn.

17:55.341 --> 17:57.575
- Popcorn

- Popcorn.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.577
- Popcorn or cornbread?
- Cornbread.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.712
- Cornbread

- Cornbread.

18:01.714 --> 18:05.216
- Cornbread or
roasted corn?
- Roasted corn.

18:05.218 --> 18:07.652
- Roasted corn
or corned beef?
- There's no corn in...

18:16.462 --> 18:18.696
Green hole.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.736
Did you see that?

18:25.738 --> 18:29.807
It worked!
( maniacal laughter )

18:29.809 --> 18:30.875
Ludo!

18:33.645 --> 18:35.813
Hello, Buffrog.

18:38.650 --> 18:40.051
It's been a while...

18:40.053 --> 18:43.054
old friend.

18:43.056 --> 18:45.656
You're... alive.

18:45.658 --> 18:47.225
Don't act so surprised.

18:47.227 --> 18:49.894
It makes it seem like
you want me dead.

18:49.896 --> 18:52.230
No, please.
I am father now.

18:52.232 --> 18:54.499
I know that,
you idiot.

18:54.501 --> 18:56.734
I'm the one who
gave you those...

19:01.840 --> 19:03.774
You see, girls?

19:03.776 --> 19:05.676
This is why I need that book.

19:05.678 --> 19:09.347
Don't know what I'm
doing with this thing.

19:11.283 --> 19:13.151
- Gotta go.
- He's getting away!

19:16.922 --> 19:18.756
Just swallow it.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.327
But I want him to die.

19:24.863 --> 19:27.331
Uh, fine.

19:27.333 --> 19:30.401
Spit him out.

19:33.772 --> 19:36.707
I was going
to let you die,

19:36.709 --> 19:39.877
but my wand told me to give
you Meat Fork's old job.

19:39.879 --> 19:41.312
Meat Fork?

19:41.314 --> 19:43.548
( groaning )

19:43.550 --> 19:44.782
Yeah.

19:44.784 --> 19:46.817
Meat Fork!

19:46.819 --> 19:49.353
But you don't need
monsters now.

19:49.355 --> 19:51.722
You have wand.

19:51.724 --> 19:54.492
Spider, bird, corn.
Rats.

19:54.494 --> 19:56.827
Yeah, it's pretty sweet.

19:56.829 --> 20:00.231
But you know,
there's more to be done.

20:01.867 --> 20:03.167
So what do you say?

20:03.169 --> 20:06.370
We gettin' the band
back together or what?

20:09.341 --> 20:11.242
I'm... I'm sorry.

20:11.244 --> 20:13.377
I think
you've lost your mind.

20:41.740 --> 20:45.743
With wand, Ludo
more powerful than ever,

20:45.745 --> 20:48.913
but more crazy
than ever, too.

20:48.915 --> 20:52.049
He make Buffrog
intriguing offer.

20:52.051 --> 20:54.952
But did I make
right choice for my tadpoles?

21:01.727 --> 21:03.361
Have crazy idea,

21:03.363 --> 21:06.764
but have to make sure
I'm not talking out loud first.

21:06.766 --> 21:10.368
A big black bug
bit a big black bear.

21:10.370 --> 21:12.970
Rubber baby buggy bumpers.
Okay, good.

21:12.972 --> 21:17.508
